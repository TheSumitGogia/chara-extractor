PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
Chancery
judge
once
had
the
kindness
to
inform
me
,
as
one
of
a
*NL*
company
of
some
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
women
not
labouring
under
*NL*
any
suspicions
of
lunacy
,
that
the
Court
of
Chancery
,
though
the
*NL*
shining
subject
of
much
popular
prejudice
-LRB-
at
which
point
I
thought
*NL*
the
judge
's
eye
had
a
cast
in
my
direction
-RRB-
,
was
almost
immaculate
.
*NL*
There
had
been
,
he
admitted
,
a
trivial
blemish
or
so
in
its
rate
of
*NL*
progress
,
but
this
was
exaggerated
and
had
been
entirely
owing
to
the
*NL*
``
parsimony
of
the
public
,
''
which
guilty
public
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
*NL*
until
lately
bent
in
the
most
determined
manner
on
by
no
means
*NL*
enlarging
the
number
of
Chancery
judges
appointed
--
I
believe
by
*NL*
Richard
the
Second
,
but
any
other
king
will
do
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
me
too
profound
a
joke
to
be
inserted
in
the
body
of
*NL*
this
book
or
I
should
have
restored
it
to
Conversation
Kenge
or
to
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
,
with
one
or
other
of
whom
I
think
it
must
have
*NL*
originated
.
In
such
mouths
I
might
have
coupled
it
with
an
apt
*NL*
quotation
from
one
of
Shakespeare
's
sonnets
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
nature
is
subdued
*NL*
To
what
it
works
in
,
like
the
dyer
's
hand
:
*NL*
Pity
me
,
then
,
and
wish
I
were
renewed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
it
is
wholesome
that
the
parsimonious
public
should
know
what
*NL*
has
been
doing
,
and
still
is
doing
,
in
this
connexion
,
I
mention
here
*NL*
that
everything
set
forth
in
these
pages
concerning
the
Court
of
*NL*
Chancery
is
substantially
true
,
and
within
the
truth
.
The
case
of
*NL*
Gridley
is
in
no
essential
altered
from
one
of
actual
occurrence
,
*NL*
made
public
by
a
disinterested
person
who
was
professionally
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
monstrous
wrong
from
beginning
to
*NL*
end
.
At
the
present
moment
-LRB-
August
,
1853
-RRB-
there
is
a
suit
before
the
*NL*
court
which
was
commenced
nearly
twenty
years
ago
,
in
which
from
*NL*
thirty
to
forty
counsel
have
been
known
to
appear
at
one
time
,
in
*NL*
which
costs
have
been
incurred
to
the
amount
of
seventy
thousand
*NL*
pounds
,
which
is
A
FRIENDLY
SUIT
,
and
which
is
-LRB-
I
am
assured
-RRB-
no
*NL*
nearer
to
its
termination
now
than
when
it
was
begun
.
There
is
*NL*
another
well-known
suit
in
Chancery
,
not
yet
decided
,
which
was
*NL*
commenced
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
and
in
which
more
than
*NL*
double
the
amount
of
seventy
thousand
pounds
has
been
swallowed
up
in
*NL*
costs
.
If
I
wanted
other
authorities
for
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
,
I
*NL*
could
rain
them
on
these
pages
,
to
the
shame
of
--
a
parsimonious
*NL*
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
only
one
other
point
on
which
I
offer
a
word
of
remark
.
The
*NL*
possibility
of
what
is
called
spontaneous
combustion
has
been
denied
*NL*
since
the
death
of
Mr.
Krook
;
and
my
good
friend
Mr.
Lewes
-LRB-
quite
*NL*
mistaken
,
as
he
soon
found
,
in
supposing
the
thing
to
have
been
*NL*
abandoned
by
all
authorities
-RRB-
published
some
ingenious
letters
to
me
*NL*
at
the
time
when
that
event
was
chronicled
,
arguing
that
spontaneous
*NL*
combustion
could
not
possibly
be
.
I
have
no
need
to
observe
that
I
do
*NL*
not
wilfully
or
negligently
mislead
my
readers
and
that
before
I
*NL*
wrote
that
description
I
took
pains
to
investigate
the
subject
.
There
*NL*
are
about
thirty
cases
on
record
,
of
which
the
most
famous
,
that
of
*NL*
the
Countess
Cornelia
de
Baudi
Cesenate
,
was
minutely
investigated
*NL*
and
described
by
Giuseppe
Bianchini
,
a
prebendary
of
Verona
,
*NL*
otherwise
distinguished
in
letters
,
who
published
an
account
of
it
at
*NL*
Verona
in
1731
,
which
he
afterwards
republished
at
Rome
.
The
*NL*
appearances
,
beyond
all
rational
doubt
,
observed
in
that
case
are
the
*NL*
appearances
observed
in
Mr.
Krook
's
case
.
The
next
most
famous
*NL*
instance
happened
at
Rheims
six
years
earlier
,
and
the
historian
in
*NL*
that
case
is
Le
Cat
,
one
of
the
most
renowned
surgeons
produced
by
*NL*
France
.
The
subject
was
a
woman
,
whose
husband
was
ignorantly
*NL*
convicted
of
having
murdered
her
;
but
on
solemn
appeal
to
a
higher
*NL*
court
,
he
was
acquitted
because
it
was
shown
upon
the
evidence
that
*NL*
she
had
died
the
death
of
which
this
name
of
spontaneous
combustion
*NL*
is
given
.
I
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
to
these
notable
facts
,
*NL*
and
that
general
reference
to
the
authorities
which
will
be
found
at
*NL*
page
30
,
vol
.
ii.
,
*
the
recorded
opinions
and
experiences
of
*NL*
distinguished
medical
professors
,
French
,
English
,
and
Scotch
,
in
*NL*
more
modern
days
,
contenting
myself
with
observing
that
I
shall
not
*NL*
abandon
the
facts
until
there
shall
have
been
a
considerable
*NL*
spontaneous
combustion
of
the
testimony
on
which
human
occurrences
*NL*
are
usually
received
.

Another

occurred
at
the
town

Columbus
,
in
the
United

quite
recently

The
subject
was
a

inveterate

CHAPTER

In
Chancery

*NL*
*NL*
London
.
Michaelmas
term
lately
over
,
and
the
Lord
Chancellor
sitting
*NL*
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Hall
.
Implacable
November
weather
.
As
much
mud
in
*NL*
the
streets
as
if
the
waters
had
but
newly
retired
from
the
face
of
*NL*
the
earth
,
and
it
would
not
be
wonderful
to
meet
a
Megalosaurus
,
*NL*
forty
feet
long
or
so
,
waddling
like
an
elephantine
lizard
up
Holborn
*NL*
Hill
.
Smoke
lowering
down
from
chimney-pots
,
making
a
soft
black
*NL*
drizzle
,
with
flakes
of
soot
in
it
as
big
as
full-grown
*NL*
snowflakes
--
gone
into
mourning
,
one
might
imagine
,
for
the
death
of
*NL*
the
sun
.
Dogs
,
undistinguishable
in
mire
.
Horses
,
scarcely
better
;
*NL*
splashed
to
their
very
blinkers
.
Foot
passengers
,
jostling
one
*NL*
another
's
umbrellas
in
a
general
infection
of
ill
temper
,
and
losing
*NL*
their
foot-hold
at
street-corners
,
where
tens
of
thousands
of
other
*NL*
foot
passengers
have
been
slipping
and
sliding
since
the
day
broke
*NL*
-LRB-
if
this
day
ever
broke
-RRB-
,
adding
new
deposits
to
the
crust
upon
crust
*NL*
of
mud
,
sticking
at
those
points
tenaciously
to
the
pavement
,
and
*NL*
accumulating
at
compound
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fog
everywhere
.
Fog
up
the
river
,
where
it
flows
among
green
aits
and
*NL*
meadows
;
fog
down
the
river
,
where
it
rolls
defiled
among
the
tiers
*NL*
of
shipping
and
the
waterside
pollutions
of
a
great
-LRB-
and
dirty
-RRB-
city
.
*NL*
Fog
on
the
Essex
marshes
,
fog
on
the
Kentish
heights
.
Fog
creeping
*NL*
into
the
cabooses
of
collier-brigs
;
fog
lying
out
on
the
yards
and
*NL*
hovering
in
the
rigging
of
great
ships
;
fog
drooping
on
the
gunwales
*NL*
of
barges
and
small
boats
.
Fog
in
the
eyes
and
throats
of
ancient
*NL*
Greenwich
pensioners
,
wheezing
by
the
firesides
of
their
wards
;
fog
*NL*
in
the
stem
and
bowl
of
the
afternoon
pipe
of
the
wrathful
skipper
,
*NL*
down
in
his
close
cabin
;
fog
cruelly
pinching
the
toes
and
fingers
of
*NL*
his
shivering
little
`
prentice
boy
on
deck
.
Chance
people
on
the
*NL*
bridges
peeping
over
the
parapets
into
a
nether
sky
of
fog
,
with
fog
*NL*
all
round
them
,
as
if
they
were
up
in
a
balloon
and
hanging
in
the
*NL*
misty
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gas
looming
through
the
fog
in
divers
places
in
the
streets
,
much
as
*NL*
the
sun
may
,
from
the
spongey
fields
,
be
seen
to
loom
by
husbandman
*NL*
and
ploughboy
.
Most
of
the
shops
lighted
two
hours
before
their
*NL*
time
--
as
the
gas
seems
to
know
,
for
it
has
a
haggard
and
unwilling
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
raw
afternoon
is
rawest
,
and
the
dense
fog
is
densest
,
and
the
*NL*
muddy
streets
are
muddiest
near
that
leaden-headed
old
obstruction
,
*NL*
appropriate
ornament
for
the
threshold
of
a
leaden-headed
old
*NL*
corporation
,
Temple
Bar
.
And
hard
by
Temple
Bar
,
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
*NL*
Hall
,
at
the
very
heart
of
the
fog
,
sits
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
in
*NL*
his
High
Court
of
Chancery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
can
there
come
fog
too
thick
,
never
can
there
come
mud
and
mire
*NL*
too
deep
,
to
assort
with
the
groping
and
floundering
condition
which
*NL*
this
High
Court
of
Chancery
,
most
pestilent
of
hoary
sinners
,
holds
*NL*
this
day
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
such
an
afternoon
,
if
ever
,
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
ought
to
be
*NL*
sitting
here
--
as
here
he
is
--
with
a
foggy
glory
round
his
head
,
*NL*
softly
fenced
in
with
crimson
cloth
and
curtains
,
addressed
by
a
*NL*
large
advocate
with
great
whiskers
,
a
little
voice
,
and
an
*NL*
interminable
brief
,
and
outwardly
directing
his
contemplation
to
the
*NL*
lantern
in
the
roof
,
where
he
can
see
nothing
but
fog
.
On
such
an
*NL*
afternoon
some
score
of
members
of
the
High
Court
of
Chancery
bar
*NL*
ought
to
be
--
as
here
they
are
--
mistily
engaged
in
one
of
the
ten
*NL*
thousand
stages
of
an
endless
cause
,
tripping
one
another
up
on
*NL*
slippery
precedents
,
groping
knee-deep
in
technicalities
,
running
*NL*
their
goat-hair
and
horsehair
warded
heads
against
walls
of
words
and
*NL*
making
a
pretence
of
equity
with
serious
faces
,
as
players
might
.
On
*NL*
such
an
afternoon
the
various
solicitors
in
the
cause
,
some
two
or
*NL*
three
of
whom
have
inherited
it
from
their
fathers
,
who
made
a
*NL*
fortune
by
it
,
ought
to
be
--
as
are
they
not
?
--
ranged
in
a
line
,
in
a
*NL*
long
matted
well
-LRB-
but
you
might
look
in
vain
for
truth
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
it
-RRB-
between
the
registrar
's
red
table
and
the
silk
gowns
,
with
*NL*
bills
,
cross-bills
,
answers
,
rejoinders
,
injunctions
,
affidavits
,
*NL*
issues
,
references
to
masters
,
masters
'
reports
,
mountains
of
costly
*NL*
nonsense
,
piled
before
them
.
Well
may
the
court
be
dim
,
with
wasting
*NL*
candles
here
and
there
;
well
may
the
fog
hang
heavy
in
it
,
as
if
it
*NL*
would
never
get
out
;
well
may
the
stained-glass
windows
lose
their
*NL*
colour
and
admit
no
light
of
day
into
the
place
;
well
may
the
*NL*
uninitiated
from
the
streets
,
who
peep
in
through
the
glass
panes
in
*NL*
the
door
,
be
deterred
from
entrance
by
its
owlish
aspect
and
by
the
*NL*
drawl
,
languidly
echoing
to
the
roof
from
the
padded
dais
where
the
*NL*
Lord
High
Chancellor
looks
into
the
lantern
that
has
no
light
in
it
*NL*
and
where
the
attendant
wigs
are
all
stuck
in
a
fog-bank
!
This
is
the
*NL*
Court
of
Chancery
,
which
has
its
decaying
houses
and
its
blighted
*NL*
lands
in
every
shire
,
which
has
its
worn-out
lunatic
in
every
*NL*
madhouse
and
its
dead
in
every
churchyard
,
which
has
its
ruined
*NL*
suitor
with
his
slipshod
heels
and
threadbare
dress
borrowing
and
*NL*
begging
through
the
round
of
every
man
's
acquaintance
,
which
gives
to
*NL*
monied
might
the
means
abundantly
of
wearying
out
the
right
,
which
so
*NL*
exhausts
finances
,
patience
,
courage
,
hope
,
so
overthrows
the
brain
*NL*
and
breaks
the
heart
,
that
there
is
not
an
honourable
man
among
its
*NL*
practitioners
who
would
not
give
--
who
does
not
often
give
--
the
*NL*
warning
,
``
Suffer
any
wrong
that
can
be
done
you
rather
than
come
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
happen
to
be
in
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
court
this
murky
afternoon
*NL*
besides
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
the
counsel
in
the
cause
,
two
or
three
*NL*
counsel
who
are
never
in
any
cause
,
and
the
well
of
solicitors
before
*NL*
mentioned
?
There
is
the
registrar
below
the
judge
,
in
wig
and
gown
;
*NL*
and
there
are
two
or
three
maces
,
or
petty-bags
,
or
privy
purses
,
or
*NL*
whatever
they
may
be
,
in
legal
court
suits
.
These
are
all
yawning
,
*NL*
for
no
crumb
of
amusement
ever
falls
from
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
-LRB-
the
*NL*
cause
in
hand
-RRB-
,
which
was
squeezed
dry
years
upon
years
ago
.
The
*NL*
short-hand
writers
,
the
reporters
of
the
court
,
and
the
reporters
of
*NL*
the
newspapers
invariably
decamp
with
the
rest
of
the
regulars
when
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
comes
on
.
Their
places
are
a
blank
.
Standing
on
*NL*
a
seat
at
the
side
of
the
hall
,
the
better
to
peer
into
the
curtained
*NL*
sanctuary
,
is
a
little
mad
old
woman
in
a
squeezed
bonnet
who
is
*NL*
always
in
court
,
from
its
sitting
to
its
rising
,
and
always
expecting
*NL*
some
incomprehensible
judgment
to
be
given
in
her
favour
.
Some
say
*NL*
she
really
is
,
or
was
,
a
party
to
a
suit
,
but
no
one
knows
for
*NL*
certain
because
no
one
cares
.
She
carries
some
small
litter
in
a
*NL*
reticule
which
she
calls
her
documents
,
principally
consisting
of
*NL*
paper
matches
and
dry
lavender
.
A
sallow
prisoner
has
come
up
,
in
*NL*
custody
,
for
the
half-dozenth
time
to
make
a
personal
application
``
to
*NL*
purge
himself
of
his
contempt
,
''
which
,
being
a
solitary
surviving
*NL*
executor
who
has
fallen
into
a
state
of
conglomeration
about
accounts
*NL*
of
which
it
is
not
pretended
that
he
had
ever
any
knowledge
,
he
is
*NL*
not
at
all
likely
ever
to
do
.
In
the
meantime
his
prospects
in
life
*NL*
are
ended
.
Another
ruined
suitor
,
who
periodically
appears
from
*NL*
Shropshire
and
breaks
out
into
efforts
to
address
the
Chancellor
at
*NL*
the
close
of
the
day
's
business
and
who
can
by
no
means
be
made
to
*NL*
understand
that
the
Chancellor
is
legally
ignorant
of
his
existence
*NL*
after
making
it
desolate
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
plants
himself
*NL*
in
a
good
place
and
keeps
an
eye
on
the
judge
,
ready
to
call
out
``
My
*NL*
Lord
!
''
in
a
voice
of
sonorous
complaint
on
the
instant
of
his
rising
.
*NL*
A
few
lawyers
'
clerks
and
others
who
know
this
suitor
by
sight
linger
*NL*
on
the
chance
of
his
furnishing
some
fun
and
enlivening
the
dismal
*NL*
weather
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
drones
on
.
This
scarecrow
of
a
suit
has
,
in
*NL*
course
of
time
,
become
so
complicated
that
no
man
alive
knows
what
it
*NL*
means
.
The
parties
to
it
understand
it
least
,
but
it
has
been
*NL*
observed
that
no
two
Chancery
lawyers
can
talk
about
it
for
five
*NL*
minutes
without
coming
to
a
total
disagreement
as
to
all
the
*NL*
premises
.
Innumerable
children
have
been
born
into
the
cause
;
*NL*
innumerable
young
people
have
married
into
it
;
innumerable
old
people
*NL*
have
died
out
of
it
.
Scores
of
persons
have
deliriously
found
*NL*
themselves
made
parties
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
without
knowing
how
*NL*
or
why
;
whole
families
have
inherited
legendary
hatreds
with
the
*NL*
suit
.
The
little
plaintiff
or
defendant
who
was
promised
a
new
*NL*
rocking-horse
when
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
should
be
settled
has
grown
*NL*
up
,
possessed
himself
of
a
real
horse
,
and
trotted
away
into
the
*NL*
other
world
.
Fair
wards
of
court
have
faded
into
mothers
and
*NL*
grandmothers
;
a
long
procession
of
Chancellors
has
come
in
and
gone
*NL*
out
;
the
legion
of
bills
in
the
suit
have
been
transformed
into
mere
*NL*
bills
of
mortality
;
there
are
not
three
Jarndyces
left
upon
the
earth
*NL*
perhaps
since
old
Tom
Jarndyce
in
despair
blew
his
brains
out
at
a
*NL*
coffee-house
in
Chancery
Lane
;
but
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
still
drags
*NL*
its
dreary
length
before
the
court
,
perennially
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
has
passed
into
a
joke
.
That
is
the
only
good
*NL*
that
has
ever
come
of
it
.
It
has
been
death
to
many
,
but
it
is
a
joke
*NL*
in
the
profession
.
Every
master
in
Chancery
has
had
a
reference
out
*NL*
of
it
.
Every
Chancellor
was
``
in
it
,
''
for
somebody
or
other
,
when
he
*NL*
was
counsel
at
the
bar
.
Good
things
have
been
said
about
it
by
*NL*
blue-nosed
,
bulbous-shoed
old
benchers
in
select
port-wine
committee
*NL*
after
dinner
in
hall
.
Articled
clerks
have
been
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
fleshing
their
legal
wit
upon
it
.
The
last
Lord
Chancellor
handled
it
*NL*
neatly
,
when
,
correcting
Mr.
Blowers
,
the
eminent
silk
gown
who
said
*NL*
that
such
a
thing
might
happen
when
the
sky
rained
potatoes
,
he
*NL*
observed
,
``
or
when
we
get
through
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
,
Mr.
*NL*
Blowers
''
--
a
pleasantry
that
particularly
tickled
the
maces
,
bags
,
and
*NL*
purses
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
many
people
out
of
the
suit
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
has
stretched
*NL*
forth
its
unwholesome
hand
to
spoil
and
corrupt
would
be
a
very
wide
*NL*
question
.
From
the
master
upon
whose
impaling
files
reams
of
dusty
*NL*
warrants
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
have
grimly
writhed
into
many
*NL*
shapes
,
down
to
the
copying-clerk
in
the
Six
Clerks
'
Office
who
has
*NL*
copied
his
tens
of
thousands
of
Chancery
folio-pages
under
that
*NL*
eternal
heading
,
no
man
's
nature
has
been
made
better
by
it
.
In
*NL*
trickery
,
evasion
,
procrastination
,
spoliation
,
botheration
,
under
*NL*
false
pretences
of
all
sorts
,
there
are
influences
that
can
never
*NL*
come
to
good
.
The
very
solicitors
'
boys
who
have
kept
the
wretched
*NL*
suitors
at
bay
,
by
protesting
time
out
of
mind
that
Mr.
Chizzle
,
*NL*
Mizzle
,
or
otherwise
was
particularly
engaged
and
had
appointments
*NL*
until
dinner
,
may
have
got
an
extra
moral
twist
and
shuffle
into
*NL*
themselves
out
of
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
The
receiver
in
the
cause
*NL*
has
acquired
a
goodly
sum
of
money
by
it
but
has
acquired
too
a
*NL*
distrust
of
his
own
mother
and
a
contempt
for
his
own
kind
.
Chizzle
,
*NL*
Mizzle
,
and
otherwise
have
lapsed
into
a
habit
of
vaguely
promising
*NL*
themselves
that
they
will
look
into
that
outstanding
little
matter
*NL*
and
see
what
can
be
done
for
Drizzle
--
who
was
not
well
used
--
when
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
shall
be
got
out
of
the
office
.
Shirking
and
*NL*
sharking
in
all
their
many
varieties
have
been
sown
broadcast
by
the
*NL*
ill-fated
cause
;
and
even
those
who
have
contemplated
its
history
*NL*
from
the
outermost
circle
of
such
evil
have
been
insensibly
tempted
*NL*
into
a
loose
way
of
letting
bad
things
alone
to
take
their
own
bad
*NL*
course
,
and
a
loose
belief
that
if
the
world
go
wrong
it
was
in
some
*NL*
off-hand
manner
never
meant
to
go
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
in
the
midst
of
the
mud
and
at
the
heart
of
the
fog
,
sits
the
*NL*
Lord
High
Chancellor
in
his
High
Court
of
Chancery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Tangle
,
''
says
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
,
latterly
something
*NL*
restless
under
the
eloquence
of
that
learned
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mlud
,
''
says
Mr.
Tangle
.
Mr.
Tangle
knows
more
of
Jarndyce
and
*NL*
Jarndyce
than
anybody
.
He
is
famous
for
it
--
supposed
never
to
have
*NL*
read
anything
else
since
he
left
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
nearly
concluded
your
argument
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mlud
,
no
--
variety
of
points
--
feel
it
my
duty
tsubmit
--
ludship
,
''
is
*NL*
the
reply
that
slides
out
of
Mr.
Tangle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
members
of
the
bar
are
still
to
be
heard
,
I
believe
?
''
says
*NL*
the
Chancellor
with
a
slight
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eighteen
of
Mr.
Tangle
's
learned
friends
,
each
armed
with
a
little
*NL*
summary
of
eighteen
hundred
sheets
,
bob
up
like
eighteen
hammers
in
a
*NL*
pianoforte
,
make
eighteen
bows
,
and
drop
into
their
eighteen
places
*NL*
of
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
proceed
with
the
hearing
on
Wednesday
fortnight
,
''
says
the
*NL*
Chancellor
.
For
the
question
at
issue
is
only
a
question
of
costs
,
a
*NL*
mere
bud
on
the
forest
tree
of
the
parent
suit
,
and
really
will
come
*NL*
to
a
settlement
one
of
these
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Chancellor
rises
;
the
bar
rises
;
the
prisoner
is
brought
forward
*NL*
in
a
hurry
;
the
man
from
Shropshire
cries
,
``
My
lord
!
''
Maces
,
bags
,
*NL*
and
purses
indignantly
proclaim
silence
and
frown
at
the
man
from
*NL*
Shropshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
reference
,
''
proceeds
the
Chancellor
,
still
on
Jarndyce
and
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
``
to
the
young
girl
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begludship
's
pardon
--
boy
,
''
says
Mr.
Tangle
prematurely
.
``
In
*NL*
reference
,
''
proceeds
the
Chancellor
with
extra
distinctness
,
``
to
the
*NL*
young
girl
and
boy
,
the
two
young
people
''
--
Mr.
Tangle
crushed
--
``
whom
*NL*
I
directed
to
be
in
attendance
to-day
and
who
are
now
in
my
private
*NL*
room
,
I
will
see
them
and
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
expediency
of
*NL*
making
the
order
for
their
residing
with
their
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tangle
on
his
legs
again
.
``
Begludship
's
pardon
--
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
their
''
--
Chancellor
looking
through
his
double
eye-glass
at
the
*NL*
papers
on
his
desk
--
``
grandfather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begludship
's
pardon
--
victim
of
rash
action
--
brains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
very
little
counsel
with
a
terrific
bass
voice
arises
,
*NL*
fully
inflated
,
in
the
back
settlements
of
the
fog
,
and
says
,
``
Will
*NL*
your
lordship
allow
me
?
I
appear
for
him
.
He
is
a
cousin
,
several
*NL*
times
removed
.
I
am
not
at
the
moment
prepared
to
inform
the
court
in
*NL*
what
exact
remove
he
is
a
cousin
,
but
he
IS
a
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
this
address
-LRB-
delivered
like
a
sepulchral
message
-RRB-
ringing
in
*NL*
the
rafters
of
the
roof
,
the
very
little
counsel
drops
,
and
the
fog
*NL*
knows
him
no
more
.
Everybody
looks
for
him
.
Nobody
can
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
speak
with
both
the
young
people
,
''
says
the
Chancellor
anew
,
*NL*
``
and
satisfy
myself
on
the
subject
of
their
residing
with
their
*NL*
cousin
.
I
will
mention
the
matter
to-morrow
morning
when
I
take
my
*NL*
seat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Chancellor
is
about
to
bow
to
the
bar
when
the
prisoner
is
*NL*
presented
.
Nothing
can
possibly
come
of
the
prisoner
's
conglomeration
*NL*
but
his
being
sent
back
to
prison
,
which
is
soon
done
.
The
man
from
*NL*
Shropshire
ventures
another
remonstrative
``
My
lord
!
''
but
the
*NL*
Chancellor
,
being
aware
of
him
,
has
dexterously
vanished
.
Everybody
*NL*
else
quickly
vanishes
too
.
A
battery
of
blue
bags
is
loaded
with
*NL*
heavy
charges
of
papers
and
carried
off
by
clerks
;
the
little
mad
old
*NL*
woman
marches
off
with
her
documents
;
the
empty
court
is
locked
up
.
*NL*
If
all
the
injustice
it
has
committed
and
all
the
misery
it
has
*NL*
caused
could
only
be
locked
up
with
it
,
and
the
whole
burnt
away
in
a
*NL*
great
funeral
pyre
--
why
so
much
the
better
for
other
parties
than
the
*NL*
parties
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
!

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
In
Fashion
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
but
a
glimpse
of
the
world
of
fashion
that
we
want
on
this
same
*NL*
miry
afternoon
.
It
is
not
so
unlike
the
Court
of
Chancery
but
that
we
*NL*
may
pass
from
the
one
scene
to
the
other
,
as
the
crow
flies
.
Both
the
*NL*
world
of
fashion
and
the
Court
of
Chancery
are
things
of
precedent
*NL*
and
usage
:
oversleeping
Rip
Van
Winkles
who
have
played
at
strange
*NL*
games
through
a
deal
of
thundery
weather
;
sleeping
beauties
whom
the
*NL*
knight
will
wake
one
day
,
when
all
the
stopped
spits
in
the
kitchen
*NL*
shall
begin
to
turn
prodigiously
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
a
large
world
.
Relatively
even
to
this
world
of
ours
,
which
*NL*
has
its
limits
too
-LRB-
as
your
Highness
shall
find
when
you
have
made
*NL*
the
tour
of
it
and
are
come
to
the
brink
of
the
void
beyond
-RRB-
,
it
is
a
*NL*
very
little
speck
.
There
is
much
good
in
it
;
there
are
many
good
and
*NL*
true
people
in
it
;
it
has
its
appointed
place
.
But
the
evil
of
it
is
*NL*
that
it
is
a
world
wrapped
up
in
too
much
jeweller
's
cotton
and
fine
*NL*
wool
,
and
can
not
hear
the
rushing
of
the
larger
worlds
,
and
can
not
*NL*
see
them
as
they
circle
round
the
sun
.
It
is
a
deadened
world
,
and
*NL*
its
growth
is
sometimes
unhealthy
for
want
of
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
Dedlock
has
returned
to
her
house
in
town
for
a
few
days
*NL*
previous
to
her
departure
for
Paris
,
where
her
ladyship
intends
to
*NL*
stay
some
weeks
,
after
which
her
movements
are
uncertain
.
The
*NL*
fashionable
intelligence
says
so
for
the
comfort
of
the
Parisians
,
*NL*
and
it
knows
all
fashionable
things
.
To
know
things
otherwise
were
to
*NL*
be
unfashionable
.
My
Lady
Dedlock
has
been
down
at
what
she
calls
,
in
*NL*
familiar
conversation
,
her
``
place
''
in
Lincolnshire
.
The
waters
are
*NL*
out
in
Lincolnshire
.
An
arch
of
the
bridge
in
the
park
has
been
*NL*
sapped
and
sopped
away
.
The
adjacent
low-lying
ground
for
half
a
mile
*NL*
in
breadth
is
a
stagnant
river
with
melancholy
trees
for
islands
in
*NL*
it
and
a
surface
punctured
all
over
,
all
day
long
,
with
falling
rain
.
*NL*
My
Lady
Dedlock
's
place
has
been
extremely
dreary
.
The
weather
for
*NL*
many
a
day
and
night
has
been
so
wet
that
the
trees
seem
wet
through
,
*NL*
and
the
soft
loppings
and
prunings
of
the
woodman
's
axe
can
make
no
*NL*
crash
or
crackle
as
they
fall
.
The
deer
,
looking
soaked
,
leave
*NL*
quagmires
where
they
pass
.
The
shot
of
a
rifle
loses
its
sharpness
in
*NL*
the
moist
air
,
and
its
smoke
moves
in
a
tardy
little
cloud
towards
*NL*
the
green
rise
,
coppice-topped
,
that
makes
a
background
for
the
*NL*
falling
rain
.
The
view
from
my
Lady
Dedlock
's
own
windows
is
*NL*
alternately
a
lead-coloured
view
and
a
view
in
Indian
ink
.
The
vases
*NL*
on
the
stone
terrace
in
the
foreground
catch
the
rain
all
day
;
and
*NL*
the
heavy
drops
fall
--
drip
,
drip
,
drip
--
upon
the
broad
flagged
*NL*
pavement
,
called
from
old
time
the
Ghost
's
Walk
,
all
night
.
On
*NL*
Sundays
the
little
church
in
the
park
is
mouldy
;
the
oaken
pulpit
*NL*
breaks
out
into
a
cold
sweat
;
and
there
is
a
general
smell
and
taste
*NL*
as
of
the
ancient
Dedlocks
in
their
graves
.
My
Lady
Dedlock
-LRB-
who
is
*NL*
childless
-RRB-
,
looking
out
in
the
early
twilight
from
her
boudoir
at
a
*NL*
keeper
's
lodge
and
seeing
the
light
of
a
fire
upon
the
latticed
*NL*
panes
,
and
smoke
rising
from
the
chimney
,
and
a
child
,
chased
by
a
*NL*
woman
,
running
out
into
the
rain
to
meet
the
shining
figure
of
a
*NL*
wrapped-up
man
coming
through
the
gate
,
has
been
put
quite
out
of
*NL*
temper
.
My
Lady
Dedlock
says
she
has
been
``
bored
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
my
Lady
Dedlock
has
come
away
from
the
place
in
*NL*
Lincolnshire
and
has
left
it
to
the
rain
,
and
the
crows
,
and
the
*NL*
rabbits
,
and
the
deer
,
and
the
partridges
and
pheasants
.
The
pictures
*NL*
of
the
Dedlocks
past
and
gone
have
seemed
to
vanish
into
the
damp
*NL*
walls
in
mere
lowness
of
spirits
,
as
the
housekeeper
has
passed
along
*NL*
the
old
rooms
shutting
up
the
shutters
.
And
when
they
will
next
come
*NL*
forth
again
,
the
fashionable
intelligence
--
which
,
like
the
fiend
,
is
*NL*
omniscient
of
the
past
and
present
,
but
not
the
future
--
can
not
yet
*NL*
undertake
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
is
only
a
baronet
,
but
there
is
no
mightier
*NL*
baronet
than
he
.
His
family
is
as
old
as
the
hills
,
and
infinitely
*NL*
more
respectable
.
He
has
a
general
opinion
that
the
world
might
get
*NL*
on
without
hills
but
would
be
done
up
without
Dedlocks
.
He
would
on
*NL*
the
whole
admit
nature
to
be
a
good
idea
-LRB-
a
little
low
,
perhaps
,
when
*NL*
not
enclosed
with
a
park-fence
-RRB-
,
but
an
idea
dependent
for
its
*NL*
execution
on
your
great
county
families
.
He
is
a
gentleman
of
strict
*NL*
conscience
,
disdainful
of
all
littleness
and
meanness
and
ready
on
*NL*
the
shortest
notice
to
die
any
death
you
may
please
to
mention
rather
*NL*
than
give
occasion
for
the
least
impeachment
of
his
integrity
.
He
is
*NL*
an
honourable
,
obstinate
,
truthful
,
high-spirited
,
intensely
*NL*
prejudiced
,
perfectly
unreasonable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
is
twenty
years
,
full
measure
,
older
than
my
Lady
.
He
*NL*
will
never
see
sixty-five
again
,
nor
perhaps
sixty-six
,
nor
yet
*NL*
sixty-seven
.
He
has
a
twist
of
the
gout
now
and
then
and
walks
a
*NL*
little
stiffly
.
He
is
of
a
worthy
presence
,
with
his
light-grey
hair
*NL*
and
whiskers
,
his
fine
shirt-frill
,
his
pure-white
waistcoat
,
and
his
*NL*
blue
coat
with
bright
buttons
always
buttoned
.
He
is
ceremonious
,
*NL*
stately
,
most
polite
on
every
occasion
to
my
Lady
,
and
holds
her
*NL*
personal
attractions
in
the
highest
estimation
.
His
gallantry
to
my
*NL*
Lady
,
which
has
never
changed
since
he
courted
her
,
is
the
one
little
*NL*
touch
of
romantic
fancy
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
he
married
her
for
love
.
A
whisper
still
goes
about
that
she
*NL*
had
not
even
family
;
howbeit
,
Sir
Leicester
had
so
much
family
that
*NL*
perhaps
he
had
enough
and
could
dispense
with
any
more
.
But
she
had
*NL*
beauty
,
pride
,
ambition
,
insolent
resolve
,
and
sense
enough
to
*NL*
portion
out
a
legion
of
fine
ladies
.
Wealth
and
station
,
added
to
*NL*
these
,
soon
floated
her
upward
,
and
for
years
now
my
Lady
Dedlock
has
*NL*
been
at
the
centre
of
the
fashionable
intelligence
and
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
fashionable
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Alexander
wept
when
he
had
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
,
everybody
*NL*
knows
--
or
has
some
reason
to
know
by
this
time
,
the
matter
having
*NL*
been
rather
frequently
mentioned
.
My
Lady
Dedlock
,
having
conquered
*NL*
HER
world
,
fell
not
into
the
melting
,
but
rather
into
the
freezing
,
*NL*
mood
.
An
exhausted
composure
,
a
worn-out
placidity
,
an
equanimity
of
*NL*
fatigue
not
to
be
ruffled
by
interest
or
satisfaction
,
are
the
*NL*
trophies
of
her
victory
.
She
is
perfectly
well-bred
.
If
she
could
be
*NL*
translated
to
heaven
to-morrow
,
she
might
be
expected
to
ascend
*NL*
without
any
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
has
beauty
still
,
and
if
it
be
not
in
its
heyday
,
it
is
not
yet
*NL*
in
its
autumn
.
She
has
a
fine
face
--
originally
of
a
character
that
*NL*
would
be
rather
called
very
pretty
than
handsome
,
but
improved
into
*NL*
classicality
by
the
acquired
expression
of
her
fashionable
state
.
Her
*NL*
figure
is
elegant
and
has
the
effect
of
being
tall
.
Not
that
she
is
*NL*
so
,
but
that
``
the
most
is
made
,
''
as
the
Honourable
Bob
Stables
has
*NL*
frequently
asserted
upon
oath
,
``
of
all
her
points
.
''
The
same
*NL*
authority
observes
that
she
is
perfectly
got
up
and
remarks
in
*NL*
commendation
of
her
hair
especially
that
she
is
the
best-groomed
*NL*
woman
in
the
whole
stud
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
her
perfections
on
her
head
,
my
Lady
Dedlock
has
come
up
*NL*
from
her
place
in
Lincolnshire
-LRB-
hotly
pursued
by
the
fashionable
*NL*
intelligence
-RRB-
to
pass
a
few
days
at
her
house
in
town
previous
to
her
*NL*
departure
for
Paris
,
where
her
ladyship
intends
to
stay
some
weeks
,
*NL*
after
which
her
movements
are
uncertain
.
And
at
her
house
in
town
,
*NL*
upon
this
muddy
,
murky
afternoon
,
presents
himself
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
old
gentleman
,
attorney-at-law
and
eke
solicitor
of
the
High
Court
of
*NL*
Chancery
,
who
has
the
honour
of
acting
as
legal
adviser
of
the
*NL*
Dedlocks
and
has
as
many
cast-iron
boxes
in
his
office
with
that
name
*NL*
outside
as
if
the
present
baronet
were
the
coin
of
the
conjuror
's
*NL*
trick
and
were
constantly
being
juggled
through
the
whole
set
.
Across
*NL*
the
hall
,
and
up
the
stairs
,
and
along
the
passages
,
and
through
the
*NL*
rooms
,
which
are
very
brilliant
in
the
season
and
very
dismal
out
of
*NL*
it
--
fairy-land
to
visit
,
but
a
desert
to
live
in
--
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
is
conducted
by
a
Mercury
in
powder
to
my
Lady
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
is
rusty
to
look
at
,
but
is
reputed
to
have
made
*NL*
good
thrift
out
of
aristocratic
marriage
settlements
and
aristocratic
*NL*
wills
,
and
to
be
very
rich
.
He
is
surrounded
by
a
mysterious
halo
of
*NL*
family
confidences
,
of
which
he
is
known
to
be
the
silent
depository
.
*NL*
There
are
noble
mausoleums
rooted
for
centuries
in
retired
glades
of
*NL*
parks
among
the
growing
timber
and
the
fern
,
which
perhaps
hold
fewer
*NL*
noble
secrets
than
walk
abroad
among
men
,
shut
up
in
the
breast
of
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
He
is
of
what
is
called
the
old
school
--
a
phrase
*NL*
generally
meaning
any
school
that
seems
never
to
have
been
young
--
and
*NL*
wears
knee-breeches
tied
with
ribbons
,
and
gaiters
or
stockings
.
One
*NL*
peculiarity
of
his
black
clothes
and
of
his
black
stockings
,
be
they
*NL*
silk
or
worsted
,
is
that
they
never
shine
.
Mute
,
close
,
irresponsive
*NL*
to
any
glancing
light
,
his
dress
is
like
himself
.
He
never
converses
*NL*
when
not
professionally
consulted
.
He
is
found
sometimes
,
speechless
*NL*
but
quite
at
home
,
at
corners
of
dinner-tables
in
great
country
*NL*
houses
and
near
doors
of
drawing-rooms
,
concerning
which
the
*NL*
fashionable
intelligence
is
eloquent
,
where
everybody
knows
him
and
*NL*
where
half
the
Peerage
stops
to
say
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
?
''
*NL*
He
receives
these
salutations
with
gravity
and
buries
them
along
with
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
is
with
my
Lady
and
is
happy
to
see
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
.
There
is
an
air
of
prescription
about
him
which
is
*NL*
always
agreeable
to
Sir
Leicester
;
he
receives
it
as
a
kind
of
*NL*
tribute
.
He
likes
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
dress
;
there
is
a
kind
of
tribute
*NL*
in
that
too
.
It
is
eminently
respectable
,
and
likewise
,
in
a
general
*NL*
way
,
retainer-like
.
It
expresses
,
as
it
were
,
the
steward
of
the
*NL*
legal
mysteries
,
the
butler
of
the
legal
cellar
,
of
the
Dedlocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Has
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
any
idea
of
this
himself
?
It
may
be
so
,
or
it
may
*NL*
not
,
but
there
is
this
remarkable
circumstance
to
be
noted
in
*NL*
everything
associated
with
my
Lady
Dedlock
as
one
of
a
class
--
as
one
*NL*
of
the
leaders
and
representatives
of
her
little
world
.
She
supposes
*NL*
herself
to
be
an
inscrutable
Being
,
quite
out
of
the
reach
and
ken
of
*NL*
ordinary
mortals
--
seeing
herself
in
her
glass
,
where
indeed
she
looks
*NL*
so
.
Yet
every
dim
little
star
revolving
about
her
,
from
her
maid
to
*NL*
the
manager
of
the
Italian
Opera
,
knows
her
weaknesses
,
prejudices
,
*NL*
follies
,
haughtinesses
,
and
caprices
and
lives
upon
as
accurate
a
*NL*
calculation
and
as
nice
a
measure
of
her
moral
nature
as
her
*NL*
dressmaker
takes
of
her
physical
proportions
.
Is
a
new
dress
,
a
new
*NL*
custom
,
a
new
singer
,
a
new
dancer
,
a
new
form
of
jewellery
,
a
new
*NL*
dwarf
or
giant
,
a
new
chapel
,
a
new
anything
,
to
be
set
up
?
There
are
*NL*
deferential
people
in
a
dozen
callings
whom
my
Lady
Dedlock
suspects
*NL*
of
nothing
but
prostration
before
her
,
who
can
tell
you
how
to
manage
*NL*
her
as
if
she
were
a
baby
,
who
do
nothing
but
nurse
her
all
their
*NL*
lives
,
who
,
humbly
affecting
to
follow
with
profound
subservience
,
*NL*
lead
her
and
her
whole
troop
after
them
;
who
,
in
hooking
one
,
hook
*NL*
all
and
bear
them
off
as
Lemuel
Gulliver
bore
away
the
stately
fleet
*NL*
of
the
majestic
Lilliput
.
``
If
you
want
to
address
our
people
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
say
Blaze
and
Sparkle
,
the
jewellers
--
meaning
by
our
people
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
and
the
rest
--
``
you
must
remember
that
you
are
not
dealing
*NL*
with
the
general
public
;
you
must
hit
our
people
in
their
weakest
*NL*
place
,
and
their
weakest
place
is
such
a
place
.
''
``
To
make
this
*NL*
article
go
down
,
gentlemen
,
''
say
Sheen
and
Gloss
,
the
mercers
,
to
*NL*
their
friends
the
manufacturers
,
``
you
must
come
to
us
,
because
we
*NL*
know
where
to
have
the
fashionable
people
,
and
we
can
make
it
*NL*
fashionable
.
''
``
If
you
want
to
get
this
print
upon
the
tables
of
my
*NL*
high
connexion
,
sir
,
''
says
Mr.
Sladdery
,
the
librarian
,
``
or
if
you
*NL*
want
to
get
this
dwarf
or
giant
into
the

or
if
you
want
to
secure
to
this
entertainment
the
patronage
of
*NL*
my

you
must
leave
it

have
been
accustomed
to
study
the
leaders
of
my
high

,

I
may
tell
you
without
vanity
that
I

--
in
which
Mr.
Sladdery
,
who
is
an
honest
man
,
does
not
*NL*
exaggerate
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
while
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
may
not
know
what
is
passing
in
the
*NL*
Dedlock
mind
at
present
,
it
is
very
possible
that
he
may
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

the
Chancellor

it

''
says
Sir
Leicester
,
giving
him
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
has
been
on
again
to-day
,
''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
replies
,
making
*NL*
one
of
his
quiet
bows
to
my
Lady
,
who
is
on
a
sofa
near
the
fire
,
*NL*
shading
her
face
with
a
hand-screen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
useless
to
ask
,
''
says
my
Lady
with
the
dreariness
of
the
*NL*
place
in
Lincolnshire
still
upon
her
,
``
whether
anything
has
been
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
that
YOU
would
call
anything
has
been
done
to-day
,
''
replies
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
ever
will
be
,
''
says
my
Lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
has
no
objection
to
an
interminable
Chancery
suit
.
It
*NL*
is
a
slow
,
expensive
,
British
,
constitutional
kind
of
thing
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
,
he
has
not
a
vital
interest
in
the
suit
in
question
,
her
part
*NL*
in
which
was
the
only
property
my
Lady
brought
him
;
and
he
has
a
*NL*
shadowy
impression
that
for
his
name
--
the
name
of
Dedlock
--
to
be
in
a
*NL*
cause
,
and
not
in
the
title
of
that
cause
,
is
a
most
ridiculous
*NL*
accident
.
But
he
regards
the
Court
of
Chancery
,
even
if
it
should
*NL*
involve
an
occasional
delay
of
justice
and
a
trifling
amount
of
*NL*
confusion
,
as
a
something
devised
in
conjunction
with
a
variety
of
*NL*
other
somethings
by
the
perfection
of
human
wisdom
for
the
eternal
*NL*
settlement
-LRB-
humanly
speaking
-RRB-
of
everything
.
And
he
is
upon
the
whole
*NL*
of
a
fixed
opinion
that
to
give
the
sanction
of
his
countenance
to
*NL*
any
complaints
respecting
it
would
be
to
encourage
some
person
in
the
*NL*
lower
classes
to
rise
up
somewhere
--
like
Wat
Tyler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
few
fresh
affidavits
have
been
put
upon
the
file
,
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
,
``
and
as
they
are
short
,
and
as
I
proceed
upon
the
*NL*
troublesome
principle
of
begging
leave
to
possess
my
clients
with
any
*NL*
new
proceedings
in
a
cause
''
--
cautious
man
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
taking
no
*NL*
more
responsibility
than
necessary
--
``
and
further
,
as
I
see
you
are
*NL*
going
to
Paris
,
I
have
brought
them
in
my
pocket

''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Sir
Leicester
was
going
to
Paris
too
,
by
the
by
,
but
the
delight
of
*NL*
the
fashionable
intelligence
was
in
his
Lady
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
takes
out
his
papers
,
asks
permission
to
place
them
*NL*
on
a
golden
talisman
of
a
table
at
my
Lady
's
elbow
,
puts
on
his
*NL*
spectacles
,
and
begins
to
read
by
the
light
of
a
shaded
lamp

*NL*
''

In

Between
John
Jarndyce

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
interrupts
,
requesting
him
to
miss
as
many
of
the
formal
*NL*
horrors
as
he
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
glances
over
his
spectacles
and
begins
again
lower
*NL*
down
.
My
Lady
carelessly
and
scornfully
abstracts
her
attention
.
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
in
a
great
chair
looks
at
the
file
and
appears
to
have
a
*NL*
stately
liking
for
the
legal
repetitions
and
prolixities
as
ranging
*NL*
among
the
national
bulwarks
.
It
happens
that
the
fire
is
hot
where
my
*NL*
Lady
sits
and
that
the
hand-screen
is
more
beautiful
than
useful
,
*NL*
being
priceless
but
small
.
My
Lady
,
changing
her
position
,
sees
the
*NL*
papers
on
the
table
--
looks
at
them
nearer
--
looks
at
them
nearer
*NL*
still
--
asks
impulsively
,
``
Who
copied
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
stops
short
,
surprised
by
my
Lady
's
animation
and
her
*NL*
unusual
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
what
you
people
call
law-hand
?
''
she
asks
,
looking
full
at
him
*NL*
in
her
careless
way
again
and
toying
with
her
screen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
.
Probably
''
--
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
examines
it
as
he
speaks
--
``
the
*NL*
legal
character
which
it
has
was
acquired
after
the
original
hand
was
*NL*
formed
.
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
to
vary
this
detestable
monotony
.
Oh
,
go
on
,
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
reads
again
.
The
heat
is
greater
;
my
Lady
screens
her
*NL*
face
.
Sir
Leicester
dozes
,
starts
up
suddenly
,
and
cries
,
``
Eh
?
What
*NL*
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
I
am
afraid

says
Mr.

who
had
risen
hastily
,
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

my

murmurs
with

``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

retires
into
another
chamber
;
bells
ring
,
feet
*NL*
shuffle
and
patter

silence
ensues

Mercury
at
last
begs
Mr.

Tulkinghorn
to
return

*NL*
*NL*
``
Better

''
quoth
Sir
Leicester
,
motioning
the
lawyer
to
sit
down
*NL*
and
read
to
him
alone
.
``
I

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
A
Progress
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
beginning
to
write
my
portion
of
*NL*
these
pages
,
for
I
know
I
am
not
clever
.
I
always
knew
that
.
I
can
*NL*
remember
,
when
I
was
a
very
little
girl
indeed
,
I
used
to
say
to
my
*NL*
doll
when
we
were
alone
together
,
``
Now
,
Dolly
,
I
am
not
clever
,
you
*NL*
know
very
well
,
and
you
must
be
patient
with
me
,
like
a
dear
!
''
And
so
*NL*
she
used
to
sit
propped
up
in
a
great
arm-chair
,
with
her
beautiful
*NL*
complexion
and
rosy
lips
,
staring
at
me
--
or
not
so
much
at
me
,
I
*NL*
think
,
as
at
nothing
--
while
I
busily
stitched
away
and
told
her
every
*NL*
one
of
my
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
old
doll
!
I
was
such
a
shy
little
thing
that
I
seldom
dared
*NL*
to
open
my
lips
,
and
never
dared
to
open
my
heart
,
to
anybody
else
.
*NL*
It
almost
makes
me
cry
to
think
what
a
relief
it
used
to
be
to
me
*NL*
when
I
came
home
from
school
of
a
day
to
run
upstairs
to
my
room
and
*NL*
say
,
``
Oh
,
you
dear
faithful
Dolly
,
I
knew
you
would
be
expecting
me
!
''
*NL*
and
then
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
,
leaning
on
the
elbow
of
her
great
*NL*
chair
,
and
tell
her
all
I
had
noticed
since
we
parted
.
I
had
always
*NL*
rather
a
noticing
way
--
not
a
quick
way
,
oh
,
no
!
--
a
silent
way
of
*NL*
noticing
what
passed
before
me
and
thinking
I
should
like
to
*NL*
understand
it
better
.
I
have
not
by
any
means
a
quick
understanding
.
*NL*
When
I
love
a
person
very
tenderly
indeed
,
it
seems
to
brighten
.
But
*NL*
even
that
may
be
my
vanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
brought
up
,
from
my
earliest
remembrance
--
like
some
of
the
*NL*
princesses
in
the
fairy
stories
,
only
I
was
not
charming
--
by
my
*NL*
godmother
.
At
least
,
I
only
knew
her
as
such
.
She
was
a
good
,
good
*NL*
woman
!
She
went
to
church
three
times
every
Sunday
,
and
to
morning
*NL*
prayers
on
Wednesdays
and
Fridays
,
and
to
lectures
whenever
there
*NL*
were
lectures
;
and
never
missed
.
She
was
handsome
;
and
if
she
had
*NL*
ever
smiled
,
would
have
been
-LRB-
I
used
to
think
-RRB-
like
an
angel
--
but
she
*NL*
never
smiled
.
She
was
always
grave
and
strict
.
She
was
so
very
good
*NL*
herself
,
I
thought
,
that
the
badness
of
other
people
made
her
frown
*NL*
all
her
life
.
I
felt
so
different
from
her
,
even
making
every
*NL*
allowance
for
the
differences
between
a
child
and
a
woman
;
I
felt
so
*NL*
poor
,
so
trifling
,
and
so
far
off
that
I
never
could
be
unrestrained
*NL*
with
her
--
no
,
could
never
even
love
her
as
I
wished
.
It
made
me
very
*NL*
sorry
to
consider
how
good
she
was
and
how
unworthy
of
her
I
was
,
and
*NL*
I
used
ardently
to
hope
that
I
might
have
a
better
heart
;
and
I
*NL*
talked
it
over
very
often
with
the
dear
old
doll
,
but
I
never
loved
*NL*
my
godmother
as
I
ought
to
have
loved
her
and
as
I
felt
I
must
have
*NL*
loved
her
if
I
had
been
a
better
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
me
,
I
dare
say
,
more
timid
and
retiring
than
I
naturally
*NL*
was
and
cast
me
upon
Dolly
as
the
only
friend
with
whom
I
felt
at
*NL*
ease
.
But
something
happened
when
I
was
still
quite
a
little
thing
*NL*
that
helped
it
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
heard
my
mama
spoken
of
.
I
had
never
heard
of
my
papa
*NL*
either
,
but
I
felt
more
interested
about
my
mama
.
I
had
never
worn
a
*NL*
black
frock
,
that
I
could
recollect
.
I
had
never
been
shown
my
mama
's
*NL*
grave
.
I
had
never
been
told
where
it
was
.
Yet
I
had
never
been
*NL*
taught
to
pray
for
any
relation
but
my
godmother
.
I
had
more
than
*NL*
once
approached
this
subject
of
my
thoughts
with
Mrs.
Rachael
,
our
*NL*
only
servant
,
who
took
my
light
away
when
I
was
in
bed
-LRB-
another
very
*NL*
good
woman
,
but
austere
to
me
-RRB-
,
and
she
had
only
said
,
``
Esther
,
good
*NL*
night
!
''
and
gone
away
and
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
there
were
seven
girls
at
the
neighbouring
school
where
I
*NL*
was
a
day
boarder
,
and
although
they
called
me
little
Esther
*NL*
Summerson
,
I
knew
none
of
them
at
home
.
All
of
them
were
older
than
*NL*
I
,
to
be
sure
-LRB-
I
was
the
youngest
there
by
a
good
deal
-RRB-
,
but
there
*NL*
seemed
to
be
some
other
separation
between
us
besides
that
,
and
*NL*
besides
their
being
far
more
clever
than
I
was
and
knowing
much
more
*NL*
than
I
did
.
One
of
them
in
the
first
week
of
my
going
to
the
school
*NL*
-LRB-
I
remember
it
very
well
-RRB-
invited
me
home
to
a
little
party
,
to
my
*NL*
great
joy
.
But
my
godmother
wrote
a
stiff
letter
declining
for
me
,
*NL*
and
I
never
went
.
I
never
went
out
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
birthday
.
There
were
holidays
at
school
on
other
*NL*
birthdays
--
none
on
mine
.
There
were
rejoicings
at
home
on
other
*NL*
birthdays
,
as
I
knew
from
what
I
heard
the
girls
relate
to
one
*NL*
another
--
there
were
none
on
mine
.
My
birthday
was
the
most
melancholy
*NL*
day
at
home
in
the
whole
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
that
unless
my
vanity
should
deceive
me
-LRB-
as
I
know
*NL*
it
may
,
for
I
may
be
very
vain
without
suspecting
it
,
though
indeed
I
*NL*
do
n't
-RRB-
,
my
comprehension
is
quickened
when
my
affection
is
.
My
*NL*
disposition
is
very
affectionate
,
and
perhaps
I
might
still
feel
such
*NL*
a
wound
if
such
a
wound
could
be
received
more
than
once
with
the
*NL*
quickness
of
that
birthday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
over
,
and
my
godmother
and
I
were
sitting
at
the
table
*NL*
before
the
fire
.
The
clock
ticked
,
the
fire
clicked
;
not
another
*NL*
sound
had
been
heard
in
the
room
or
in
the
house
for
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
long
.
I
happened
to
look
timidly
up
from
my
stitching
,
across
the
*NL*
table
at
my
godmother
,
and
I
saw
in
her
face
,
looking
gloomily
at
me
,
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
far
better
,
little
Esther
,
that
you
had
had
no
*NL*
birthday
,
that
you
had
never
been
born
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
broke
out
crying
and
sobbing
,
and
I
said
,
``
Oh
,
dear
godmother
,
tell
*NL*
me
,
pray
do
tell
me
,
did
Mama
die
on
my
birthday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
returned
.
``
Ask
me
no
more
,
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
pray
tell
me
something
of
her
.
Do
now
,
at
last
,
dear
*NL*
godmother
,
if
you
please
!
What
did
I
do
to
her
?
How
did
I
lose
her
?
*NL*
Why
am
I
so
different
from
other
children
,
and
why
is
it
my
fault
,
*NL*
dear
godmother
?
No
,
no
,
no
,
do
n't
go
away
.
Oh
,
speak
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
a
kind
of
fright
beyond
my
grief
,
and
I
caught
hold
of
her
*NL*
dress
and
was
kneeling
to
her
.
She
had
been
saying
all
the
while
,
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
!
''
But
now
she
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
darkened
face
had
such
power
over
me
that
it
stopped
me
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
my
vehemence
.
I
put
up
my
trembling
little
hand
to
clasp
*NL*
hers
or
to
beg
her
pardon
with
what
earnestness
I
might
,
but
withdrew
*NL*
it
as
she
looked
at
me
,
and
laid
it
on
my
fluttering
heart
.
She
*NL*
raised
me
,
sat
in
her
chair
,
and
standing
me
before
her
,
said
slowly
*NL*
in
a
cold
,
low
voice
--
I
see
her
knitted
brow
and
pointed
*NL*
finger
--
``
Your
mother
,
Esther
,
is
your
disgrace
,
and
you
were
hers
.
*NL*
The
time
will
come
--
and
soon
enough
--
when
you
will
understand
this
*NL*
better
and
will
feel
it
too
,
as
no
one
save
a
woman

her

the

She
checked

however

as
I
was
about
to
depart
from
her

so
frozen

was

added
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
up
to
my
room
,
and
crept
to
bed
,
and
laid
my
doll
's
cheek
*NL*
against
mine
wet
with
tears
,
and
holding
that
solitary
friend
upon
my
*NL*
bosom
,
cried
myself
to
sleep
.
Imperfect
as
my
understanding
of
my
*NL*
sorrow
was
,
I
knew
that
I
had
brought
no
joy
at
any
time
to
anybody
's
*NL*
heart
and
that
I
was
to
no
one
upon
earth
what
Dolly
was
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
,
dear
,
to
think
how
much
time
we
passed
alone
together
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
how
often
I
repeated
to
the
doll
the
story
of
my
*NL*
birthday
and
confided
to
her
that
I
would
try
as
hard
as
ever
I
could
*NL*
to
repair
the
fault
I
had
been
born
with
-LRB-
of
which
I
confessedly
felt
*NL*
guilty
and
yet
innocent
-RRB-
and
would
strive
as
I
grew
up
to
be
*NL*
industrious
,
contented
,
and
kind-hearted
and
to
do
some
good
to
some
*NL*
one
,
and
win
some
love
to
myself
if
I
could
.
I
hope
it
is
not
*NL*
self-indulgent
to
shed
these
tears
as
I
think
of
it
.
I
am
very
*NL*
thankful
,
I
am
very
cheerful
,
but
I
can
not
quite
help
their
coming
to
*NL*
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
!
I
have
wiped
them
away
now
and
can
go
on
again
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
distance
between
my
godmother
and
myself
so
much
more
*NL*
after
the
birthday
,
and
felt
so
sensible
of
filling
a
place
in
her
*NL*
house
which
ought
to
have
been
empty
,
that
I
found
her
more
difficult
*NL*
of
approach
,
though
I
was
fervently
grateful
to
her
in
my
heart
,
than
*NL*
ever
.
I
felt
in
the
same
way
towards
my
school
companions
;
I
felt
in
*NL*
the
same
way
towards
Mrs.
Rachael
,
who
was
a
widow
;
and
oh
,
towards
*NL*
her
daughter
,
of
whom
she
was
proud
,
who
came
to
see
her
once
a
*NL*
fortnight
!
I
was
very
retired
and
quiet
,
and
tried
to
be
very
*NL*
diligent
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
sunny
afternoon
when
I
had
come
home
from
school
with
my
books
*NL*
and
portfolio
,
watching
my
long
shadow
at
my
side
,
and
as
I
was
*NL*
gliding
upstairs
to
my
room
as
usual
,
my
godmother
looked
out
of
the
*NL*
parlour-door
and
called
me
back
.
Sitting
with
her
,
I
found
--
which
was
*NL*
very
unusual
indeed
--
a
stranger
.
A
portly
,
important-looking
*NL*
gentleman
,
dressed
all
in
black
,
with
a
white
cravat
,
large
gold
*NL*
watch
seals
,
a
pair
of
gold
eye-glasses
,
and
a
large
seal-ring
upon
*NL*
his
little
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
my
godmother
in
an
undertone
,
``
is
the
child
.
''
Then
she
*NL*
said
in
her
naturally
stern
way
of
speaking
,
``
This
is
Esther
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
put
up
his
eye-glasses
to
look
at
me
and
said
,
``
Come
*NL*
here
,
my
dear
!
''
He
shook
hands
with
me
and
asked
me
to
take
off
my
*NL*
bonnet
,
looking
at
me
all
the
while
.
When
I
had
complied
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
and
afterwards
``
Yes
!
''
And
then
,
taking
off
his
eye-glasses
and
*NL*
folding
them
in
a
red
case
,
and
leaning
back
in
his
arm-chair
,
*NL*
turning
the
case
about
in
his
two
hands
,
he
gave
my
godmother
a
nod
.
*NL*
Upon
that
,
my
godmother
said
,
``
You
may
go
upstairs
,
Esther
!
''
And
I
*NL*
made
him
my
curtsy
and
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
have
been
two
years
afterwards
,
and
I
was
almost
fourteen
,
*NL*
when
one
dreadful
night
my
godmother
and
I
sat
at
the
fireside
.
I
was
*NL*
reading
aloud
,
and
she
was
listening
.
I
had
come
down
at
nine
o'clock
*NL*
as
I
always
did
to
read
the
Bible
to
her
,
and
was
reading
from
St.
*NL*
John
how
our
Saviour
stooped
down
,
writing
with
his
finger
in
the
*NL*
dust
,
when
they
brought
the
sinful
woman
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
when
they
continued
asking
him
,
he
lifted
up
himself
and
said
*NL*
unto
them
,
`
He
that
is
without
sin
among
you
,
let
him
first
cast
a
*NL*
stone
at
her
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
stopped
by
my
godmother
's
rising
,
putting
her
hand
to
her
head
,
*NL*
and
crying
out
in
an
awful
voice
from
quite
another
part
of
the
book
,
*NL*
''
`
Watch
ye
,
therefore
,
lest
coming
suddenly
he
find
you
sleeping
.
And
*NL*
what
I
say
unto
you
,
I
say
unto
all
,
Watch
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
,
while
she
stood
before
me
repeating
these
words
,
she
*NL*
fell
down
on
the
floor
.
I
had
no
need
to
cry
out
;
her
voice
had
*NL*
sounded
through
the
house
and
been
heard
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
laid
upon
her
bed
.
For
more
than
a
week
she
lay
there
,
little
*NL*
altered
outwardly
,
with
her
old
handsome
resolute
frown
that
I
so
*NL*
well
knew
carved
upon
her
face
.
Many
and
many
a
time
,
in
the
day
and
*NL*
in
the
night
,
with
my
head
upon
the
pillow
by
her
that
my
whispers
*NL*
might
be
plainer
to
her
,
I
kissed
her
,
thanked
her
,
prayed
for
her
,
*NL*
asked
her
for
her
blessing
and
forgiveness
,
entreated
her
to
give
me
*NL*
the
least
sign
that
she
knew
or
heard
me
.
No
,
no
,
no
.
Her
face
was
*NL*
immovable
.
To
the
very
last
,
and
even
afterwards
,
her
frown
remained
*NL*
unsoftened
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
after
my
poor
good
godmother
was
buried
,
the
gentleman
in
*NL*
black
with
the
white
neckcloth
reappeared
.
I
was
sent
for
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachael
,
and
found
him
in
the
same
place
,
as
if
he
had
never
gone
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Kenge
,
''
he
said
;
``
you
may
remember
it
,
my
child
;
Kenge
*NL*
and
Carboy
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
I
remembered
to
have
seen
him
once
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
be
seated
--
here
near
me
.
Do
n't
distress
yourself
;
it
's
of
no

Mrs.
Rachael
,
I
need
n't
inform
you
who
were
acquainted
with

*NL*
late
Miss
Barbary

means
die
with

Mr.

smoothly

*NL*
``

putting
up

*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
,
wondering
even
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
of
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce

said
Mr.
Kenge
,
looking
over
his
*NL*
glasses
at
me
and
softly
turning
the
case
about
and
about
as
if
he
*NL*
were
petting
something
.
``
Not

afraid

Mr.
Kenge
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair

*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
very
ignorant
,
but
what
could
I
do
?
I
was
so
entirely
*NL*
unacquainted
with
the
subject
that
I
understood
nothing
about
it
even
*NL*
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
leaning
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
again
and
looking
calmly
at
us
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
to
enjoy
beyond
everything
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
wonder
at
that
,
for
it
was
mellow
and
full
and
gave
great
*NL*
importance
to
every
word
he
uttered
.
He
listened
to
himself
with
*NL*
obvious
satisfaction
and
sometimes
gently
beat
time
to
his
own
music
*NL*
with
his
head
or
rounded
a
sentence
with
his
hand
.
I
was
very
much
*NL*
impressed
by
him
--
even
then
,
before
I
knew
that
he
formed
himself
on
*NL*
the
model
of
a
great
lord
who
was
his
client
and
that
he
was
*NL*
generally
called
Conversation
Kenge

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
pursued

*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
was
filled
so
full
,
both
by
what
he
said
and
by
his
*NL*
affecting
manner
of
saying
it

that
I
was
not
able

speak

I

tried

proceeded
Mr.

What
the

could
*NL*
never
relate
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
interview
took
place
at
Windsor
,
where
I
had
passed
-LRB-
as
far
as
I
*NL*
knew
-RRB-
my
whole
life
.
On
that
day
week
,
amply
provided
with
all
*NL*
necessaries
,
I
left
it
,
inside
the
stagecoach
,
for
Reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachael
was
too
good
to
feel
any
emotion
at
parting
,
but
I
was
*NL*
not
so
good
,
and
wept
bitterly
.
I
thought
that
I
ought
to
have
known
*NL*
her
better
after
so
many
years
and
ought
to
have
made
myself
enough
*NL*
of
a
favourite
with
her
to
make
her
sorry
then
.
When
she
gave
me
one
*NL*
cold
parting
kiss
upon
my
forehead
,
like
a
thaw-drop
from
the
stone
*NL*
porch
--
it
was
a
very
frosty
day
--
I
felt
so
miserable
and
*NL*
self-reproachful
that
I
clung
to
her
and
told
her
it
was
my
fault
,
I
*NL*
knew
,
that
she
could
say
good-bye
so
easily
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Esther
!
''
she
returned
.
``
It
is
your
misfortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
was
at
the
little
lawn-gate
--
we
had
not
come
out
until
we
*NL*
heard
the
wheels
--
and
thus
I
left
her
,
with
a
sorrowful
heart
.
She
*NL*
went
in
before
my
boxes
were
lifted
to
the
coach-roof
and
shut
the
*NL*
door
.
As
long
as
I
could
see
the
house
,
I
looked
back
at
it
from
the
*NL*
window
through
my
tears
.
My
godmother
had
left
Mrs.
Rachael
all
the
*NL*
little
property
she
possessed
;
and
there
was
to
be
a
sale
;
and
an
old
*NL*
hearth-rug
with
roses
on
it
,
which
always
seemed
to
me
the
first
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
I
had
ever
seen
,
was
hanging
outside
in
the
frost
*NL*
and
snow
.
A
day
or
two
before
,
I
had
wrapped
the
dear
old
doll
in
her
*NL*
own
shawl
and
quietly
laid
her
--
I
am
half
ashamed
to
tell
it
--
in
the
*NL*
garden-earth
under
the
tree
that
shaded
my
old
window
.
I
had
no
*NL*
companion
left
but
my
bird
,
and
him
I
carried
with
me
in
his
cage
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
house
was
out
of
sight
,
I
sat
,
with
my
bird-cage
in
the
*NL*
straw
at
my
feet
,
forward
on
the
low
seat
to
look
out
of
the
high
*NL*
window
,
watching
the
frosty
trees
,
that
were
like
beautiful
pieces
of
*NL*
spar
,
and
the
fields
all
smooth
and
white
with
last
night
's
snow
,
and
*NL*
the
sun
,
so
red
but
yielding
so
little
heat
,
and
the
ice
,
dark
like
*NL*
metal
where
the
skaters
and
sliders
had
brushed
the
snow
away
.
There
*NL*
was
a
gentleman
in
the
coach
who
sat
on
the
opposite
seat
and
looked
*NL*
very
large
in
a
quantity
of
wrappings
,
but
he
sat
gazing
out
of
the
*NL*
other
window
and
took
no
notice
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
my
dead
godmother
,
of
the
night
when
I
read
to
her
,
of
*NL*
her
frowning
so
fixedly
and
sternly
in
her
bed
,
of
the
strange
place
*NL*
I
was
going
to
,
of
the
people
I
should
find
there
,
and
what
they
*NL*
would
be
like
,
and
what
they
would
say
to
me
,
when
a
voice
in
the
*NL*
coach
gave
me
a
terrible
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
said
,
``
What
the
de-vil
are
you
crying
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
frightened
that
I
lost
my
voice
and
could
only
answer
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
``
Me
,
sir
?
''
For
of
course
I
knew
it
must
have
been
the
*NL*
gentleman
in
the
quantity
of
wrappings
,
though
he
was
still
looking
*NL*
out
of
his
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
,
''
he
said
,
turning
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
I
was
crying
,
sir
,
''
I
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
!
''
said
the
gentleman
.
``
Look
here
!
''
He
came
quite
*NL*
opposite
to
me
from
the
other
corner
of
the
coach
,
brushed
one
of
his
*NL*
large
furry
cuffs
across
my
eyes
-LRB-
but
without
hurting
me
-RRB-
,
and
showed
*NL*
me
that
it
was
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
Now
you
know
you
are
,
''
he
said
.
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
crying
for
?
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
*NL*
go
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
Why
,
wherever
you
are
going
,
''
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
go
there
,
sir
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
!
Look
glad
!
''
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
he
was
very
strange
,
or
at
least
that
what
I
could
see
of
*NL*
him
was
very
strange
,
for
he
was
wrapped
up
to
the
chin
,
and
his
face
*NL*
was
almost
hidden
in
a
fur
cap
with
broad
fur
straps
at
the
side
of
*NL*
his
head
fastened
under
his
chin
;
but
I
was
composed
again
,
and
not
*NL*
afraid
of
him
.
So
I
told
him
that
I
thought
I
must
have
been
crying
*NL*
because
of
my
godmother
's
death
and
because
of
Mrs.
Rachael
's
not
*NL*
being
sorry
to
part
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
Mrs.
Rachael
!
''
said
the
gentleman
.
``
Let
her
fly
away
in
a
*NL*
high
wind
on
a
broomstick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
be
really
afraid
of
him
now
and
looked
at
him
with
the
*NL*
greatest
astonishment
.
But
I
thought
that
he
had
pleasant
eyes
,
*NL*
although
he
kept
on
muttering
to
himself
in
an
angry
manner
and
*NL*
calling
Mrs.
Rachael
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
he
opened
his
outer
wrapper
,
which
appeared
to
*NL*
me
large
enough
to
wrap
up
the
whole
coach
,
and
put
his
arm
down
into
*NL*
a
deep
pocket
in
the
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
look
here
!
''
he
said
.
``
In
this
paper
,
''
which
was
nicely
folded
,
*NL*
``
is
a
piece
of
the
best
plum-cake
that
can
be
got
for
money
--
sugar
on
*NL*
the
outside
an
inch
thick
,
like
fat
on
mutton
chops
.
Here
's
a
little
*NL*
pie
-LRB-
a
gem
this
is
,
both
for
size
and
quality
-RRB-
,
made
in
France
.
And
*NL*
what
do
you
suppose
it
's
made
of
?
Livers
of
fat
geese
.
There
's
a
pie
!
*NL*
Now
let
's
see
you
eat
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
I
replied
;
``
thank
you
very
much
indeed
,
but
I
hope
*NL*
you
wo
n't
be
offended
--
they
are
too
rich
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Floored
again
!
''
said
the
gentleman
,
which
I
did
n't
at
all
*NL*
understand
,
and
threw
them
both
out
of
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
speak
to
me
any
more
until
he
got
out
of
the
coach
a
*NL*
little
way
short
of
Reading
,
when
he
advised
me
to
be
a
good
girl
and
*NL*
to
be
studious
,
and
shook
hands
with
me
.
I
must
say
I
was
relieved
by
*NL*
his
departure
.
We
left
him
at
a
milestone
.
I
often
walked
past
it
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
never
for
a
long
time
without
thinking
of
him
and
*NL*
half
expecting
to
meet
him
.
But
I
never
did
;
and
so
,
as
time
went
on
,
*NL*
he
passed
out
of
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
coach
stopped
,
a
very
neat
lady
looked
up
at
the
window
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Miss
Donny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
Esther
Summerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
quite
right
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
Miss
Donny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
understood
that
she
introduced
herself
by
that
name
,
and
begged
*NL*
Miss
Donny
's
pardon
for
my
mistake
,
and
pointed
out
my
boxes
at
her
*NL*
request
.
Under
the
direction
of
a
very
neat
maid
,
they
were
put
*NL*
outside
a
very
small
green
carriage
;
and
then
Miss
Donny
,
the
maid
,
*NL*
and
I
got
inside
and
were
driven
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
ready
for
you
,
Esther
,
''
said
Miss
Donny
,
``
and
the
*NL*
scheme
of
your
pursuits
has
been
arranged
in
exact
accordance
with
*NL*
the
wishes
of
your
guardian
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
--
did
you
say
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
your
guardian
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
said
Miss
Donny
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
bewildered
that
Miss
Donny
thought
the
cold
had
been
too
*NL*
severe
for
me
and
lent
me
her
smelling-bottle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
my
--
guardian
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
ma'am
?
''
I
asked
after
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
personally
,
Esther
,
''
said
Miss
Donny
;
``
merely
through
his
*NL*
solicitors
,
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
,
of
London
.
A
very
superior
*NL*
gentleman
,
Mr.
Kenge
.
Truly
eloquent
indeed
.
Some
of
his
periods
*NL*
quite
majestic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
this
to
be
very
true
but
was
too
confused
to
attend
to
it
.
Our
*NL*
speedy
arrival
at
our
destination
,
before
I
had
time
to
recover
*NL*
myself
,
increased
my
confusion
,
and
I
never
shall
forget
the
*NL*
uncertain
and
the
unreal
air
of
everything
at
Greenleaf
-LRB-
Miss
Donny
's
*NL*
house
-RRB-
that
afternoon
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
soon
became
used
to
it
.
I
was
so
adapted
to
the
routine
of
*NL*
Greenleaf
before
long
that
I
seemed
to
have
been
there
a
great
while
*NL*
and
almost
to
have
dreamed
rather
than
really
lived
my
old
life
at
my
*NL*
godmother
's
.
Nothing
could
be
more
precise
,
exact
,
and
orderly
than
*NL*
Greenleaf
.
There
was
a
time
for
everything
all
round
the
dial
of
the
*NL*
clock
,
and
everything
was
done
at
its
appointed
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
twelve
boarders
,
and
there
were
two
Miss
Donnys
,
twins
.
It
*NL*
was
understood
that
I
would
have
to
depend
,
by
and
by
,
on
my
*NL*
qualifications
as
a
governess
,
and
I
was
not
only
instructed
in
*NL*
everything
that
was
taught
at
Greenleaf
,
but
was
very
soon
engaged
in
*NL*
helping
to
instruct
others
.
Although
I
was
treated
in
every
other
*NL*
respect
like
the
rest
of
the
school
,
this
single
difference
was
made
*NL*
in
my
case
from
the
first
.
As
I
began
to
know
more
,
I
taught
more
,
*NL*
and
so
in
course
of
time
I
had
plenty
to
do
,
which
I
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
doing
because
it
made
the
dear
girls
fond
of
me
.
At
last
,
whenever
a
*NL*
new
pupil
came
who
was
a
little
downcast
and
unhappy
,
she
was
so
*NL*
sure
--
indeed
I
do
n't
know
why
--
to
make
a
friend
of
me
that
all
*NL*
new-comers
were
confided
to
my
care
.
They
said
I
was
so
gentle
,
but
I
*NL*
am
sure
THEY
were
!
I
often
thought
of
the
resolution
I
had
made
on
my
*NL*
birthday
to
try
to
be
industrious
,
contented
,
and
true-hearted
and
to
*NL*
do
some
good
to
some
one
and
win
some
love
if
I
could
;
and
indeed
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
felt
almost
ashamed
to
have
done
so
little
and
have
won
so
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
at
Greenleaf
six
happy
,
quiet
years
.
I
never
saw
in
any
face
*NL*
there
,
thank
heaven
,
on
my
birthday
,
that
it
would
have
been
better
*NL*
if
I
had
never
been
born
.
When
the
day
came
round
,
it
brought
me
so
*NL*
many
tokens
of
affectionate
remembrance
that
my
room
was
beautiful
*NL*
with
them
from
New
Year
's
Day
to
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
those
six
years
I
had
never
been
away
except
on
visits
at
holiday
*NL*
time
in
the
neighbourhood
.
After
the
first
six
months
or
so
I
had
*NL*
taken
Miss
Donny
's
advice
in
reference
to
the
propriety
of
writing
to
*NL*
Mr.
Kenge
to
say
that
I
was
happy
and
grateful
,
and
with
her
approval
*NL*
I
had
written
such
a
letter
.
I
had
received
a
formal
answer
*NL*
acknowledging
its
receipt
and
saying
,
``
We
note
the
contents
thereof
,
*NL*
which
shall
be
duly
communicated
to
our
client
.
''
After
that
I
*NL*
sometimes
heard
Miss
Donny
and
her
sister
mention
how
regular
my
*NL*
accounts
were
paid
,
and
about
twice
a
year
I
ventured
to
write
a
*NL*
similar
letter
.
I
always
received
by
return
of
post
exactly
the
same
*NL*
answer
in
the
same
round
hand
,
with
the
signature
of
Kenge
and
Carboy
*NL*
in
another
writing
,
which
I
supposed
to
be
Mr.
Kenge
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
so
curious
to
me
to
be
obliged
to
write
all
this
about
*NL*
myself
!
As
if
this
narrative
were
the
narrative
of
MY
life
!
But
my
*NL*
little
body
will
soon
fall
into
the
background
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
quiet
years
-LRB-
I
find
I
am
saying
it
for
the
second
time
-RRB-
I
had
*NL*
passed
at
Greenleaf
,
seeing
in
those
around
me
,
as
it
might
be
in
a
*NL*
looking-glass
,
every
stage
of
my
own
growth
and
change
there
,
when
,
*NL*
one
November
morning
,
I
received
this
letter
.
I
omit
the
date
.

Oh
,
never
,
never
,
never
shall
I
forget
the
emotion
this
letter
caused
*NL*
in
the
house
!
It
was
so
tender
in
them
to
care
so
much
for
me
,
it
was
*NL*
so
gracious
in
that
father
who
had
not
forgotten
me
to
have
made
my
*NL*
orphan
way
so
smooth
and
easy
and
to
have
inclined
so
many
youthful
*NL*
natures
towards
me
,
that
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
Not
that
I
would
*NL*
have
had
them
less
sorry
--
I
am
afraid
not
;
but
the
pleasure
of
it
,
*NL*
and
the
pain
of
it
,
and
the
pride
and
joy
of
it
,
and
the
humble
*NL*
regret
of
it
were
so
blended
that
my
heart
seemed
almost
breaking
*NL*
while
it
was
full
of
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
gave
me
only
five
days
'
notice
of
my
removal
.
When
every
*NL*
minute
added
to
the
proofs
of
love
and
kindness
that
were
given
me
in
*NL*
those
five
days
,
and
when
at
last
the
morning
came
and
when
they
took
*NL*
me
through
all
the
rooms
that
I
might
see
them
for
the
last
time
,
and
*NL*
when
some
cried
,
``
Esther
,
dear
,
say
good-bye
to
me
here
at
my
*NL*
bedside
,
where
you
first
spoke
so
kindly
to
me
!
''
and
when
others
*NL*
asked
me
only
to
write
their
names
,
``
With
Esther
's
love
,
''
and
when
*NL*
they
all
surrounded
me
with
their
parting
presents
and
clung
to
me
*NL*
weeping
and
cried
,
``
What
shall
we
do
when
dear
,
dear
Esther
's
gone
!
''
*NL*
and
when
I
tried
to
tell
them
how
forbearing
and
how
good
they
had
*NL*
all
been
to
me
and
how
I
blessed
and
thanked
them
every
one
,
what
a
*NL*
heart
I
had
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
the
two
Miss
Donnys
grieved
as
much
to
part
with
me
as
the
*NL*
least
among
them
,
and
when
the
maids
said
,
``
Bless
you
,
miss
,
wherever
*NL*
you
go
!
''
and
when
the
ugly
lame
old
gardener
,
who
I
thought
had
*NL*
hardly
noticed
me
in
all
those
years
,
came
panting
after
the
coach
to
*NL*
give
me
a
little
nosegay
of
geraniums
and
told
me
I
had
been
the
*NL*
light
of
his
eyes
--
indeed
the
old
man
said
so
!
--
what
a
heart
I
had
*NL*
then
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
could
I
help
it
if
with
all
this
,
and
the
coming
to
the
little
*NL*
school
,
and
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
poor
children
outside
waving
*NL*
their
hats
and
bonnets
to
me
,
and
of
a
grey-haired
gentleman
and
lady
*NL*
whose
daughter
I
had
helped
to
teach
and
at
whose
house
I
had
visited
*NL*
-LRB-
who
were
said
to
be
the
proudest
people
in
all
that
country
-RRB-
,
caring
*NL*
for
nothing
but
calling
out
,
``
Good-bye
,
Esther
.
May
you
be
very
*NL*
happy
!
''
--
could
I
help
it
if
I
was
quite
bowed
down
in
the
coach
by
*NL*
myself
and
said
``
Oh
,
I
am
so
thankful
,
I
am
so
thankful
!
''
many
times
*NL*
over
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
course
I
soon
considered
that
I
must
not
take
tears
where
I
*NL*
was
going
after
all
that
had
been
done
for
me
.
Therefore
,
of
course
,
*NL*
I
made
myself
sob
less
and
persuaded
myself
to
be
quiet
by
saying
*NL*
very
often
,
``
Esther
,
now
you
really
must
!
This
WILL
NOT
do
!
''
I
*NL*
cheered
myself
up
pretty
well
at
last
,
though
I
am
afraid
I
was
*NL*
longer
about
it
than
I
ought
to
have
been
;
and
when
I
had
cooled
my
*NL*
eyes
with
lavender
water
,
it
was
time
to
watch
for
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
quite
persuaded
that
we
were
there
when
we
were
ten
miles
off
,
*NL*
and
when
we
really
were
there
,
that
we
should
never
get
there
.
*NL*
However
,
when
we
began
to
jolt
upon
a
stone
pavement
,
and
*NL*
particularly
when
every
other
conveyance
seemed
to
be
running
into
*NL*
us
,
and
we
seemed
to
be
running
into
every
other
conveyance
,
I
began
*NL*
to
believe
that
we
really
were
approaching
the
end
of
our
journey
.
*NL*
Very
soon
afterwards
we
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
gentleman
who
had
inked
himself
by
accident
addressed
me
from
*NL*
the
pavement
and
said
,
``
I
am
from
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
,
miss
,
of
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
obliging
,
and
as
he
handed
me
into
a
fly
after
*NL*
superintending
the
removal
of
my
boxes
,
I
asked
him
whether
there
was
*NL*
a
great
fire
anywhere
?
For
the
streets
were
so
full
of
dense
brown
*NL*
smoke
that
scarcely
anything
was
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
no
,
miss
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
is
a
London
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fog
,
miss
,
''
said
the
young
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
drove
slowly
through
the
dirtiest
and
darkest
streets
that
ever
*NL*
were
seen
in
the
world
-LRB-
I
thought
-RRB-
and
in
such
a
distracting
state
of
*NL*
confusion
that
I
wondered
how
the
people
kept
their
senses
,
until
we
*NL*
passed
into
sudden
quietude
under
an
old
gateway
and
drove
on
through
*NL*
a
silent
square
until
we
came
to
an
odd
nook
in
a
corner
,
where
there
*NL*
was
an
entrance
up
a
steep
,
broad
flight
of
stairs
,
like
an
entrance
*NL*
to
a
church
.
And
there
really
was
a
churchyard
outside
under
some
*NL*
cloisters
,
for
I
saw
the
gravestones
from
the
staircase
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
.
The
young
gentleman
showed
me
through
an
*NL*
outer
office
into
Mr.
Kenge
's
room
--
there
was
no
one
in
it
--
and
*NL*
politely
put
an
arm-chair
for
me
by
the
fire
.
He
then
called
my
*NL*
attention
to
a
little
looking-glass
hanging
from
a
nail
on
one
side
*NL*
of
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
case
you
should
wish
to
look
at
yourself
,
miss
,
after
the
*NL*
journey
,
as
you
're
going
before
the
Chancellor
.
Not
that
it
's
*NL*
requisite
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
the
young
gentleman
civilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
before
the
Chancellor
?
''
I
said
,
startled
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
matter
of
form
,
miss
,
''
returned
the
young
gentleman
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Kenge
is
in
court
now
.
He
left
his
compliments
,
and
would
you
partake
*NL*
of
some
refreshment
''
--
there
were
biscuits
and
a
decanter
of
wine
on
a
*NL*
small
table
--
``
and
look
over
the
paper
,
''
which
the
young
gentleman
*NL*
gave
me
as
he
spoke
.
He
then
stirred
the
fire
and
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
so
strange
--
the
stranger
from
its
being
night
in
the
*NL*
day-time
,
the
candles
burning
with
a
white
flame
,
and
looking
raw
and
*NL*
cold
--
that
I
read
the
words
in
the
newspaper
without
knowing
what
*NL*
they
meant
and
found
myself
reading
the
same
words
repeatedly
.
As
it
*NL*
was
of
no
use
going
on
in
that
way
,
I
put
the
paper
down
,
took
a
peep
*NL*
at
my
bonnet
in
the
glass
to
see
if
it
was
neat
,
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
room
,
which
was
not
half
lighted
,
and
at
the
shabby
,
dusty
tables
,
*NL*
and
at
the
piles
of
writings
,
and
at
a
bookcase
full
of
the
most
*NL*
inexpressive-looking
books
that
ever
had
anything
to
say
for
*NL*
themselves
.
Then
I
went
on
,
thinking
,
thinking
,
thinking
;
and
the
*NL*
fire
went
on
,
burning
,
burning
,
burning
;
and
the
candles
went
on
*NL*
flickering
and
guttering
,
and
there
were
no
snuffers
--
until
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
by
and
by
brought
a
very
dirty
pair
--
for
two
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mr.
Kenge
came
.
HE
was
not
altered
,
but
he
was
surprised
to
*NL*
see
how
altered
I
was
and
appeared
quite
pleased
.
``
As
you
are
going
*NL*
to
be
the
companion
of
the
young
lady
who
is
now
in
the
Chancellor
's
*NL*
private
room
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
thought
it
well
that
you
*NL*
should
be
in
attendance
also
.
You
will
not
be
discomposed
by
the
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
,
''
really
not
seeing
on
*NL*
consideration
why
I
should
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mr.
Kenge
gave
me
his
arm
and
we
went
round
the
corner
,
under
a
*NL*
colonnade
,
and
in
at
a
side
door
.
And
so
we
came
,
along
a
passage
,
*NL*
into
a
comfortable
sort
of
room
where
a
young
lady
and
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
were
standing
near
a
great
,
loud-roaring
fire
.
A
screen
was
*NL*
interposed
between
them
and
it
,
and
they
were
leaning
on
the
screen
,
*NL*
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
looked
up
when
I
came
in
,
and
I
saw
in
the
young
lady
,
with
*NL*
the
fire
shining
upon
her
,
such
a
beautiful
girl
!
With
such
rich
*NL*
golden
hair
,
such
soft
blue
eyes
,
and
such
a
bright
,
innocent
,
*NL*
trusting
face
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Ada
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
``
this
is
Miss
Summerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
to
meet
me
with
a
smile
of
welcome
and
her
hand
extended
,
*NL*
but
seemed
to
change
her
mind
in
a
moment
and
kissed
me
.
In
short
,
*NL*
she
had
such
a
natural
,
captivating
,
winning
manner
that
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
we
were
sitting
in
the
window-seat
,
with
the
light
of
the
*NL*
fire
upon
us
,
talking
together
as
free
and
happy
as
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
load
off
my
mind
!
It
was
so
delightful
to
know
that
she
could
*NL*
confide
in
me
and
like
me
!
It
was
so
good
of
her
,
and
so
encouraging
*NL*
to
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
gentleman
was
her
distant
cousin
,
she
told
me
,
and
his
name
*NL*
Richard
Carstone
.
He
was
a
handsome
youth
with
an
ingenuous
face
and
*NL*
a
most
engaging
laugh
;
and
after
she
had
called
him
up
to
where
we
*NL*
sat
,
he
stood
by
us
,
in
the
light
of
the
fire
,
talking
gaily
,
like
a
*NL*
light-hearted
boy
.
He
was
very
young
,
not
more
than
nineteen
then
,
if
*NL*
quite
so
much
,
but
nearly
two
years
older
than
she
was
.
They
were
*NL*
both
orphans
and
-LRB-
what
was
very
unexpected
and
curious
to
me
-RRB-
had
*NL*
never
met
before
that
day
.
Our
all
three
coming
together
for
the
*NL*
first
time
in
such
an
unusual
place
was
a
thing
to
talk
about
,
and
we
*NL*
talked
about
it
;
and
the
fire
,
which
had
left
off
roaring
,
winked
its
*NL*
red
eyes
at
us
--
as
Richard
said
--
like
a
drowsy
old
Chancery
lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
conversed
in
a
low
tone
because
a
full-dressed
gentleman
in
a
bag
*NL*
wig
frequently
came
in
and
out
,
and
when
he
did
so
,
we
could
hear
a
*NL*
drawling
sound
in
the
distance
,
which
he
said
was
one
of
the
counsel
*NL*
in
our
case
addressing
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
He
told
Mr.
Kenge
that
*NL*
the
Chancellor
would
be
up
in
five
minutes
;
and
presently
we
heard
a
*NL*
bustle
and
a
tread
of
feet
,
and
Mr.
Kenge
said
that
the
Court
had
*NL*
risen
and
his
lordship
was
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
in
the
bag
wig
opened
the
door
almost
directly
and
*NL*
requested
Mr.
Kenge
to
come
in
.
Upon
that
,
we
all
went
into
the
next
*NL*
room
,
Mr.
Kenge
first
,
with
my
darling
--
it
is
so
natural
to
me
now
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
help
writing
it
;
and
there
,
plainly
dressed
in
black
and
*NL*
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
at
a
table
near
the
fire
,
was
his
lordship
,
*NL*
whose
robe
,
trimmed
with
beautiful
gold
lace
,
was
thrown
upon
another
*NL*
chair
.
He
gave
us
a
searching
look
as
we
entered
,
but
his
manner
was
*NL*
both
courtly
and
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
in
the
bag
wig
laid
bundles
of
papers
on
his
lordship
's
*NL*
table
,
and
his
lordship
silently
selected
one
and
turned
over
the
*NL*
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Clare
,
''
said
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
``
Miss
Ada
Clare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kenge
presented
her
,
and
his
lordship
begged
her
to
sit
down
near
*NL*
him
.
That
he
admired
her
and
was
interested
by
her
even
I
could
see
*NL*
in
a
moment
.
It
touched
me
that
the
home
of
such
a
beautiful
young
*NL*
creature
should
be
represented
by
that
dry
,
official
place
.
The
Lord
*NL*
High
Chancellor
,
at
his
best
,
appeared
so
poor
a
substitute
for
the
*NL*
love
and
pride
of
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Jarndyce
in
question
,
''
said
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
still
turning
*NL*
over
leaves
,
``
is
Jarndyce
of
Bleak
House
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jarndyce
of
Bleak
House
,
my
lord
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dreary
name
,
''
said
the
Lord
Chancellor
.

heard

say
in

with

smile

gave

an
indulgent
look

acknowledged
my
curtsy

very
graciously

*NL*
Mr.

leant
over
before

was
quite
said

whispered

His

lordship
,
with
his
eyes
upon
his
papers
,
listened
,
nodded
twice
or
*NL*
thrice
,
turned
over
more
leaves
,
and
did
not
look
towards
me
again
*NL*
until
we
were
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kenge
now
retired
,
and
Richard
with
him
,
to
where
I
was
,
near
the
*NL*
door
,
leaving
my
pet
-LRB-
it
is
so
natural
to
me
that
again
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
it

-RRB-
sitting
near
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
with
whom
his
lordship
spoke
a
*NL*
little
part
,
asking
her
,
as
she
told
me
afterwards
,
whether
she
had
*NL*
well
reflected
on
the
proposed
arrangement
,
and
if
she
thought
she
*NL*
would
be
happy
under
the
roof
of
Mr.
Jarndyce
of
Bleak
House
,
and
why
*NL*
she
thought
so
?
Presently
he
rose
courteously
and
released
her
,
and
*NL*
then
he
spoke
for
a
minute
or
two
with
Richard
Carstone
,
not
seated
,
*NL*
but
standing
,
and
altogether
with
more
ease
and
less
ceremony
,
as
if
*NL*
he
still
knew
,
though
he
WAS
Lord
Chancellor
,
how
to
go
straight
to
*NL*
the
candour
of
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
''
said
his
lordship
aloud
.
``
I
shall
make
the
order

may
judge

and
this
*NL*
was
when
he
looked
at
me
,
``
a

good

the

circumstances
admit

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dismissed
us
pleasantly
,
and
we
all
went
out
,
very
much
obliged
to
*NL*
him
for
being
so
affable
and
polite
,
by
which
he
had
certainly
lost
*NL*
no
dignity
but
seemed
to
us
to
have
gained
some
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
under
the
colonnade
,
Mr.
Kenge
remembered
that
he
must
go
*NL*
back
for
a
moment
to
ask
a
question
and
left
us
in
the
fog
,
with
the
*NL*
Lord
Chancellor
's
carriage
and
servants
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
.

*NL*
``
Well

he
.

*NL*
``

I
asked

she

``
Do

you

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
I

*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
at
one
another
,
half
laughing
at
our
being
like
the
*NL*
children
in
the
wood
,
when
a
curious
little
old
woman
in
a
squeezed
*NL*
bonnet
and
carrying
a
reticule
came
curtsying
and
smiling
up
to
us
*NL*
with
an
air
of
great
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
she

*NL*
*NL*
``

whispered
Richard
,
not
thinking
she
could
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
!
Mad

young
gentleman

she
returned
so
quickly
that
he
was
*NL*
quite
abashed
.
``
I
was
a

myself

I
was
not

*NL*
curtsying
low
and
smiling
between
every

*NL*
*NL*
As
Ada
was
a
little
frightened
,
I
said
,
to
humour
the
poor
old
lady
,
*NL*
that
we
were
much
obliged
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
said
mincingly

up
with

*NL*
She
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
steep

broad
flight
of
stairs
;

*NL*
we
looked
back
as
we
went
up

she
was
still
there

saying

still

with

curtsy

CHAPTER

Telescopic
Philanthropy

*NL*
*NL*
We
were
to
pass
the
night
,
Mr.
Kenge
told
us
when
we
arrived
in
his
*NL*
room
,
at
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
;
and
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
he
took
it
*NL*
for
granted
I
knew
who
Mrs.
Jellyby
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
do
n't
,
sir
,
''
I
returned
.
``
Perhaps
Mr.
Carstone
--
or
Miss
*NL*
Clare
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
,
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
``
In-deed
!
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
*NL*
casting
his
eyes
over
the
dusty
hearth-rug
as
if
it
were
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
's
biography
,
``
is
a
lady
of
very
remarkable
strength
of
*NL*
character
who
devotes
herself
entirely
to
the
public
.
She
has
devoted
*NL*
herself
to
an
extensive
variety
of
public
subjects
at
various
times
*NL*
and
is
at
present
-LRB-
until
something
else
attracts
her

devoted
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
Africa
,
with
a
view
to
the
general
cultivation
of
the
*NL*
coffee
berry
--
AND
the
natives
--
and
the
happy
settlement
,
on
the
banks
*NL*
of
the
African
rivers
,
of
our
superabundant
home
population
.
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
who
is
desirous
to
aid
any
work
that
is
considered
likely
*NL*
to
be
a
good
work
and
who
is
much
sought
after
by
philanthropists
,
*NL*
has
,
I
believe
,
a
very
high
opinion
of
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kenge
,
adjusting
his
cravat
,
then
looked
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.
Jellyby
,
sir
?
''
suggested
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mr.
Jellyby
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
``
is
--
a
--
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
*NL*
describe
him
to
you
better
than
by
saying
that
he
is
the
husband
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nonentity

said
Richard
with
a
droll
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
that
,
''
returned
Mr.
Kenge
gravely
.
``
I
ca
n't
say
that

*NL*
indeed

I
know
nothing
whatever
OF
Mr.
Jellyby

I
never
,
to
my
*NL*
knowledge
,
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Mr.
Jellyby
.
He
may
be
a
very
*NL*
superior
man
,
but
he
is
,
so
to
speak
,
merged
--
merged
--
in
the
more
*NL*
shining
qualities
of
his
wife
.
''
Mr.
Kenge
proceeded
to
tell
us
that
*NL*
as
the
road
to
Bleak
House
would
have
been
very
long
,
dark
,
and
*NL*
tedious
on
such
an
evening
,
and
as
we
had
been
travelling
already
,
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
himself
proposed
this
arrangement
.
A
carriage
would
*NL*
be
at
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
to
convey
us
out
of
town
early
in
the
forenoon
*NL*
of
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
rang
a
little
bell
,
and
the
young
gentleman
came
in
.
*NL*
Addressing
him
by
the
name
of
Guppy
,
Mr.
Kenge
inquired
whether
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
's
boxes
and
the
rest
of
the
baggage
had
been
``
sent
round
.
''
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
said
yes
,
they
had
been
sent
round
,
and
a
coach
was
waiting
*NL*
to
take
us
round
too
as
soon
as
we
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
only
remains
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
shaking
hands
with
us
,
``

*NL*

Where

Mr.

said
Richard
as
we
went
downstairs

*NL*
``
No

Mr.

``

*NL*
``
Only
round

said
Mr.

``
We

up

along

as

particular

He
seemed
quite
delighted
with
it
on
my
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fog
is
very
dense
indeed
!

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
it
affects
you
,
though
,
I
'm

''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
putting
*NL*
up
the
steps
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
it
seems
to
do
you
good
,
miss
,
*NL*
judging
from
your
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
he
meant
well
in
paying
me
this
compliment
,
so
I
laughed
at
*NL*
myself
for
blushing
at
it
when
he
had
shut
the
door
and
got
upon
the
*NL*
box
;
and
we
all
three
laughed
and
chatted
about
our
inexperience
and
*NL*
the
strangeness
of
London
until
we
turned
up
under
an
archway
to
our
*NL*
destination
--
a
narrow
street
of
high
houses
like
an
oblong
cistern
to
*NL*
hold
the
fog
.
There
was
a
confused
little
crowd
of
people
,
*NL*
principally
children
,
gathered
about
the
house
at
which
we
stopped
,
*NL*
which
had
a
tarnished
brass
plate
on
the
door
with
the
inscription
*NL*
JELLYBY
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
frightened
!
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
looking
in
at
the
*NL*
coach-window
.
``
One
of
the
young
Jellybys

and
got
his
head
*NL*
through

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
I
;

me
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
be
careful
of
yourself
,
miss
.
The
young
Jellybys
are
always
up
*NL*
to
something
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
my
way
to
the
poor
child
,
who
was
one
of
the
dirtiest
little
*NL*
unfortunates
I
ever
saw
,
and
found
him
very
hot
and
frightened
and
*NL*
crying
loudly
,
fixed
by
the
neck
between
two
iron
railings
,
while
a
*NL*
milkman
and
a
beadle
,
with
the
kindest
intentions
possible
,
were
*NL*
endeavouring
to
drag
him
back
by
the
legs
,
under
a
general
impression
*NL*
that
his
skull
was
compressible
by
those
means
.
As
I
found
-LRB-
after
*NL*
pacifying
him
-RRB-
that
he
was
a
little
boy
with
a
naturally
large
head
,
*NL*
I
thought
that
perhaps
where
his
head
could
go
,
his
body
could
*NL*
follow
,
and
mentioned
that
the
best
mode
of
extrication
might
be
to
*NL*
push
him
forward
.
This
was
so
favourably
received
by
the
milkman
and
*NL*
beadle
that
he
would
immediately
have
been
pushed
into
the
area
if
I
*NL*
had
not
held
his
pinafore
while
Richard
and
Mr.
Guppy
ran
down
*NL*
through
the
kitchen
to
catch
him
when
he
should
be
released
.
At
last
*NL*
he
was
happily
got
down
without
any
accident
,
and
then
he
began
to
*NL*
beat
Mr.
Guppy
with
a
hoop-stick
in
quite
a
frantic
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
had
appeared
belonging
to
the
house
except
a
person
in
*NL*
pattens
,
who
had
been
poking
at
the
child
from
below
with
a
broom
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
with
what
object
,
and
I
do
n't
think
she
did
.
I
therefore
*NL*
supposed
that
Mrs.
Jellyby
was
not
at
home
,
and
was
quite
surprised
*NL*
when
the
person
appeared
in
the
passage
without
the
pattens
,
and
*NL*
going
up
to
the
back
room
on
the
first
floor
before
Ada
and
me
,
*NL*
announced
us
as
,
``
Them
two
young
ladies
,
Missis
Jellyby
!
''
We
passed
*NL*
several
more
children
on
the
way
up
,
whom
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
*NL*
treading
on
in
the
dark
;
and
as
we
came
into
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
presence
,
*NL*
one
of
the
poor
little
things
fell
downstairs
--
down
a
whole
flight
*NL*
-LRB-
as
it
sounded
to
me
-RRB-
,
with
a
great
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
whose
face
reflected
none
of
the
uneasiness
which
we
*NL*
could
not
help
showing
in
our
own
faces
as
the
dear
child
's
head
*NL*
recorded
its
passage
with
a
bump
on
every
stair
--
Richard
afterwards
*NL*
said
he
counted
seven
,
besides
one
for
the
landing
--
received
us
with
*NL*
perfect
equanimity
.
She
was
a
pretty
,
very
diminutive
,
plump
woman
of
*NL*
from
forty
to
fifty
,
with
handsome
eyes
,
though
they
had
a
curious
*NL*
habit
of
seeming
to
look
a
long
way
off
.
As
if
--
I
am
quoting
Richard
*NL*
again
--
they
could
see
nothing
nearer
than
Africa
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
indeed
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
in
an
agreeable
voice
,
``
to
*NL*
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
you
.
I
have
a
great
respect
for
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
and
no
one
in
whom
he
is
interested
can
be
an
object
of
*NL*
indifference
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
expressed
our
acknowledgments
and
sat
down
behind
the
door
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
lame
invalid
of
a
sofa
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
had
very
good
hair
*NL*
but
was
too
much
occupied
with
her
African
duties
to
brush
it
.
The
*NL*
shawl
in
which
she
had
been
loosely
muffled
dropped
onto
her
chair
*NL*
when
she
advanced
to
us
;
and
as
she
turned
to
resume
her
seat
,
we
*NL*
could
not
help
noticing
that
her
dress
did
n't
nearly
meet
up
the
back
*NL*
and
that
the
open
space
was
railed
across
with
a
lattice-work
of
*NL*
stay-lace
--
like
a
summer-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
,
which
was
strewn
with
papers
and
nearly
filled
by
a
great
*NL*
writing-table
covered
with
similar
litter
,
was
,
I
must
say
,
not
only
*NL*
very
untidy
but
very
dirty
.
We
were
obliged
to
take
notice
of
that
*NL*
with
our
sense
of
sight
,
even
while
,
with
our
sense
of
hearing
,
we
*NL*
followed
the
poor
child
who
had
tumbled
downstairs
:
I
think
into
the
*NL*
back
kitchen
,
where
somebody
seemed
to
stifle
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
principally
struck
us
was
a
jaded
and
unhealthy-looking
*NL*
though
by
no
means
plain
girl
at
the
writing-table
,
who
sat
biting
*NL*
the
feather
of
her
pen
and
staring
at
us
.
I
suppose
nobody
ever
was
*NL*
in
such
a
state
of
ink
.
And
from
her
tumbled
hair
to
her
pretty
feet
,
*NL*
which
were
disfigured
with
frayed
and
broken
satin
slippers
trodden
*NL*
down
at
heel
,
she
really
seemed
to
have
no
article
of
dress
upon
her
,
*NL*
from
a
pin
upwards
,
that
was
in
its
proper
condition
or
its
right
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
me
,
my
dears
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
snuffing
the
two
great
*NL*
office
candles
in
tin
candlesticks
,
which
made
the
room
taste
*NL*
strongly
of
hot
tallow
-LRB-
the
fire
had
gone
out
,
and
there
was
nothing
*NL*
in
the
grate
but
ashes
,
a
bundle
of
wood
,
and
a
poker
-RRB-
,
``
you
find
me
,
*NL*
my
dears
,
as
usual
,
very
busy
;
but
that
you
will
excuse
.
The
African
*NL*
project
at
present
employs
my
whole
time
.
It
involves
me
in
*NL*
correspondence
with
public
bodies
and
with
private
individuals
*NL*
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
their
species
all
over
the
country
.
I
am
*NL*
happy
to
say
it
is
advancing
.
We
hope
by
this
time
next
year
to
have
*NL*
from
a
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
healthy
families
cultivating
*NL*
coffee
and
educating
the
natives
of
Borrioboola-Gha
,
on
the
left
bank
*NL*
of
the
Niger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Ada
said
nothing
,
but
looked
at
me
,
I
said
it
must
be
very
*NL*
gratifying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
IS
gratifying
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
``
It
involves
the
devotion
of
*NL*
all
my
energies
,
such
as
they
are
;
but
that
is
nothing
,
so
that
it
*NL*
succeeds
;
and
I
am
more
confident
of
success
every
day
.
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
,
I
almost
wonder
that
YOU
never
turned
your
thoughts
*NL*
to
Africa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
application
of
the
subject
was
really
so
unexpected
to
me
that
I
*NL*
was
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
receive
it
.
I
hinted
that
the
climate
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
finest
climate
in
the
world
!
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
With
precaution
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
``
You
may
go
into
*NL*
Holborn
,
without
precaution
,
and
be
run
over
.
You
may
go
into
*NL*
Holborn
,
with
precaution
,
and
never
be
run
over
.
Just
so
with
*NL*
Africa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
``
No
doubt
.
''
I
meant
as
to
Holborn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
like
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
putting
a
number
of
papers
*NL*
towards
us
,
``
to
look
over
some
remarks
on
that
head
,
and
on
the
*NL*
general
subject
,
which
have
been
extensively
circulated
,
while
I
*NL*
finish
a
letter
I
am
now
dictating
to
my
eldest
daughter
,
who
is
my
*NL*
amanuensis
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
at
the
table
left
off
biting
her
pen
and
made
a
return
to
*NL*
our
recognition
,
which
was
half
bashful
and
half
sulky
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
I
shall
then
have
finished
for
the
present
,
''
proceeded
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
with
a
sweet
smile
,
``
though
my
work
is
never
done
.
Where
are
*NL*
you
,
Caddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Presents
her
compliments
to
Mr.
Swallow
,
and
begs

''
said
Caddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
begs
,
'
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
dictating
,
''
`
to
inform
him
,
in
*NL*
reference
to
his
letter
of
inquiry
on
the
African
project
--
'
No
,
*NL*
Peepy
!
Not
on
my
account
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peepy
-LRB-
so
self-named
-RRB-
was
the
unfortunate
child
who
had
fallen
*NL*
downstairs
,
who
now
interrupted
the
correspondence
by
presenting
*NL*
himself
,
with
a
strip
of
plaster
on
his
forehead
,
to
exhibit
his
*NL*
wounded
knees
,
in
which
Ada
and
I
did
not
know
which
to
pity
*NL*
most
--
the
bruises
or
the
dirt
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
merely
added
,
with
the
*NL*
serene
composure
with
which
she
said
everything
,
``
Go
along
,
you
*NL*
naughty
Peepy
!
''
and
fixed
her
fine
eyes
on
Africa
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
she
at
once
proceeded
with
her
dictation
,
and
as
I
*NL*
interrupted
nothing
by
doing
it
,
I
ventured
quietly
to
stop
poor
*NL*
Peepy
as
he
was
going
out
and
to
take
him
up
to
nurse
.
He
looked
very
*NL*
much
astonished
at
it
and
at
Ada
's
kissing
him
,
but
soon
fell
fast
*NL*
asleep
in
my
arms
,
sobbing
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
,
until
he
*NL*
was
quiet
.
I
was
so
occupied
with
Peepy
that
I
lost
the
letter
in
*NL*
detail
,
though
I
derived
such
a
general
impression
from
it
of
the
*NL*
momentous
importance
of
Africa
,
and
the
utter
insignificance
of
all
*NL*
other
places
and
things
,
that
I
felt
quite
ashamed
to
have
thought
so
*NL*
little
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
o'clock
!
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
``
And
our
dinner
hour
is
nominally
*NL*
-LRB-
for
we
dine
at
all
hours
-RRB-
five
!
Caddy
,
show
Miss
Clare
and
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
their
rooms
.
You
will
like
to
make
some
change
,
perhaps
?
*NL*
You
will
excuse
me
,
I
know
,
being
so
much
occupied
.
Oh
,
that
very
bad
*NL*
child
!
Pray
put
him
down
,
Miss
Summerson
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
begged
permission
to
retain
him
,
truly
saying
that
he
was
not
at
*NL*
all
troublesome
,
and
carried
him
upstairs
and
laid
him
on
my
bed
.
Ada
*NL*
and
I
had
two
upper
rooms
with
a
door
of
communication
between
.
They
*NL*
were
excessively
bare
and
disorderly
,
and
the
curtain
to
my
window
*NL*
was
fastened
up
with
a
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
like
some
hot
water
,
would
n't
you
?
''
said
Miss
Jellyby
,
*NL*
looking
round
for
a
jug
with
a
handle
to
it
,
but
looking
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
not
being
troublesome
,
''
said
we
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
the
trouble
,
''
returned
Miss
Jellyby
;
``
the
question
is
,
*NL*
if
there
IS
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
so
very
cold
and
the
rooms
had
such
a
marshy
smell
*NL*
that
I
must
confess
it
was
a
little
miserable
,
and
Ada
was
half
*NL*
crying
.
We
soon
laughed
,
however
,
and
were
busily
unpacking
when
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
came
back
to
say
that
she
was
sorry
there
was
no
hot
water
,
*NL*
but
they
could
n't
find
the
kettle
,
and
the
boiler
was
out
of
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
begged
her
not
to
mention
it
and
made
all
the
haste
we
could
to
*NL*
get
down
to
the
fire
again
.
But
all
the
little
children
had
come
up
*NL*
to
the
landing
outside
to
look
at
the
phenomenon
of
Peepy
lying
on
my
*NL*
bed
,
and
our
attention
was
distracted
by
the
constant
apparition
of
*NL*
noses
and
fingers
in
situations
of
danger
between
the
hinges
of
the
*NL*
doors
.
It
was
impossible
to
shut
the
door
of
either
room
,
for
my
*NL*
lock
,
with
no
knob
to
it
,
looked
as
if
it
wanted
to
be
wound
up
;
and
*NL*
though
the
handle
of
Ada
's
went
round
and
round
with
the
greatest
*NL*
smoothness
,
it
was
attended
with
no
effect
whatever
on
the
door
.
*NL*
Therefore
I
proposed
to
the
children
that
they
should
come
in
and
be
*NL*
very
good
at
my
table
,
and
I
would
tell
them
the
story
of
Little
Red
*NL*
Riding
Hood
while
I
dressed
;
which
they
did
,
and
were
as
quiet
as
*NL*
mice
,
including
Peepy
,
who
awoke
opportunely
before
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
went
downstairs
we
found
a
mug
with
``
A
Present
from
Tunbridge
*NL*
Wells
''
on
it
lighted
up
in
the
staircase
window
with
a
floating
wick
,
*NL*
and
a
young
woman
,
with
a
swelled
face
bound
up
in
a
flannel
bandage
*NL*
blowing
the
fire
of
the
drawing-room
-LRB-
now
connected
by
an
open
door
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
room
-RRB-
and
choking
dreadfully
.
It
smoked
to
that
*NL*
degree
,
in
short
,
that
we
all
sat
coughing
and
crying
with
the
*NL*
windows
open
for
half
an
hour
,
during
which
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
with
the
*NL*
same
sweetness
of
temper
,
directed
letters
about
Africa
.
Her
being
so
*NL*
employed
was
,
I
must
say
,
a
great
relief
to
me
,
for
Richard
told
us
*NL*
that
he
had
washed
his
hands
in
a
pie-dish
and
that
they
had
found
*NL*
the
kettle
on
his
dressing-table
,
and
he
made
Ada
laugh
so
that
they
*NL*
made
me
laugh
in
the
most
ridiculous
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
seven
o'clock
we
went
down
to
dinner
,
carefully
,
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
's
advice
,
for
the
stair-carpets
,
besides
being
very
deficient
*NL*
in
stair-wires
,
were
so
torn
as
to
be
absolute
traps
.
We
had
a
fine
*NL*
cod-fish
,
a
piece
of
roast
beef
,
a
dish
of
cutlets
,
and
a
pudding
;
an
*NL*
excellent
dinner
,
if
it
had
had
any
cooking
to
speak
of
,
but
it
was
*NL*
almost
raw
.
The
young
woman
with
the
flannel
bandage
waited
,
and
*NL*
dropped
everything
on
the
table
wherever
it
happened
to
go
,
and
never
*NL*
moved
it
again
until
she
put
it
on
the
stairs
.
The
person
I
had
seen
*NL*
in
pattens
,
who
I
suppose
to
have
been
the
cook
,
frequently
came
and
*NL*
skirmished
with
her
at
the
door
,
and
there
appeared
to
be
ill
will
*NL*
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
dinner
--
which
was
long
,
in
consequence
of
such
accidents
*NL*
as
the
dish
of
potatoes
being
mislaid
in
the
coal
skuttle
and
the
*NL*
handle
of
the
corkscrew
coming
off
and
striking
the
young
woman
in
*NL*
the
chin
--
Mrs.
Jellyby
preserved
the
evenness
of
her
disposition
.
She
*NL*
told
us
a
great
deal
that
was
interesting
about
Borrioboola-Gha
and
*NL*
the
natives
,
and
received
so
many
letters
that
Richard
,
who
sat
by
*NL*
her
,
saw
four
envelopes
in
the
gravy
at
once
.
Some
of
the
letters
*NL*
were
proceedings
of
ladies
'
committees
or
resolutions
of
ladies
'
*NL*
meetings
,
which
she
read
to
us
;
others
were
applications
from
people
*NL*
excited
in
various
ways
about
the
cultivation
of
coffee
,
and
natives
;
*NL*
others
required
answers
,
and
these
she
sent
her
eldest
daughter
from
*NL*
the
table
three
or
four
times
to
write
.
She
was
full
of
business
and
*NL*
undoubtedly
was
,
as
she
had
told
us
,
devoted
to
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
little
curious
to
know
who
a
mild
bald
gentleman
in
*NL*
spectacles
was
,
who
dropped
into
a
vacant
chair
-LRB-
there
was
no
top
or
*NL*
bottom
in
particular
-RRB-
after
the
fish
was
taken
away
and
seemed
*NL*
passively
to
submit
himself
to
Borrioboola-Gha
but
not
to
be
actively
*NL*
interested
in
that
settlement
.
As
he
never
spoke
a
word
,
he
might
*NL*
have
been
a
native
but
for
his
complexion
.
It
was
not
until
we
left
*NL*
the
table
and
he
remained
alone
with
Richard
that
the
possibility
of
*NL*
his
being
Mr.
Jellyby
ever
entered
my
head
.
But
he
WAS
Mr.
Jellyby
;
*NL*
and
a
loquacious
young
man
called
Mr.
Quale
,
with
large
shining
knobs
*NL*
for
temples
and
his
hair
all
brushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
,
who
*NL*
came
in
the
evening
,
and
told
Ada
he
was
a
philanthropist
,
also
*NL*
informed
her
that
he
called
the
matrimonial
alliance
of
Mrs.
Jellyby
*NL*
with
Mr.
Jellyby
the
union
of
mind
and
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
man
,
besides
having
a
great
deal
to
say
for
himself
about
*NL*
Africa
and
a
project
of
his
for
teaching
the
coffee
colonists
to
*NL*
teach
the
natives
to
turn
piano-forte
legs
and
establish
an
export
*NL*
trade
,
delighted
in
drawing
Mrs.
Jellyby
out
by
saying
,
``
I
believe
*NL*
now
,
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
you
have
received
as
many
as
from
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
to
two
hundred
letters
respecting
Africa
in
a
single
day
,
have
*NL*
you
not
?
''
or
,
``
If
my
memory
does
not
deceive
me
,
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
you
*NL*
once
mentioned
that
you
had
sent
off
five
thousand
circulars
from
one
*NL*
post-office
at
one
time
?
''
--
always
repeating
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
answer
to
*NL*
us
like
an
interpreter
.
During
the
whole
evening
,
Mr.
Jellyby
sat
in
*NL*
a
corner
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
if
he
were
subject
to
low
*NL*
spirits
.
It
seemed
that
he
had
several
times
opened
his
mouth
when
*NL*
alone
with
Richard
after
dinner
,
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
,
*NL*
but
had
always
shut
it
again
,
to
Richard
's
extreme
confusion
,
without
*NL*
saying
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
sitting
in
quite
a
nest
of
waste
paper
,
drank
coffee
*NL*
all
the
evening
and
dictated
at
intervals
to
her
eldest
daughter
.
She
*NL*
also
held
a
discussion
with
Mr.
Quale
,
of
which
the
subject
seemed
to
*NL*
be
--
if
I
understood
it
--
the
brotherhood
of
humanity
,
and
gave
*NL*
utterance
to
some
beautiful
sentiments
.
I
was
not
so
attentive
an
*NL*
auditor
as
I
might
have
wished
to
be
,
however
,
for
Peepy
and
the
*NL*
other
children
came
flocking
about
Ada
and
me
in
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
drawing-room
to
ask
for
another
story
;
so
we
sat
down
among
them
and
*NL*
told
them
in
whispers
``
Puss
in
Boots
''
and
I
do
n't
know
what
else
*NL*
until
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
accidentally
remembering
them
,
sent
them
to
bed
.
*NL*
As
Peepy
cried
for
me
to
take
him
to
bed
,
I
carried
him
upstairs
,
*NL*
where
the
young
woman
with
the
flannel
bandage
charged
into
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
little
family
like
a
dragon
and
overturned
them
into
cribs
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
I
occupied
myself
in
making
our
room
a
little
tidy
and
in
*NL*
coaxing
a
very
cross
fire
that
had
been
lighted
to
burn
,
which
at
*NL*
last
it
did
,
quite
brightly
.
On
my
return
downstairs
,
I
felt
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
looked
down
upon
me
rather
for
being
so
frivolous
,
and
I
*NL*
was
sorry
for
it
,
though
at
the
same
time
I
knew
that
I
had
no
higher
*NL*
pretensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
midnight
before
we
found
an
opportunity
of
going
to
*NL*
bed
,
and
even
then
we
left
Mrs.
Jellyby
among
her
papers
drinking
*NL*
coffee
and
Miss
Jellyby
biting
the
feather
of
her
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
strange
house
!
''
said
Ada
when
we
got
upstairs
.
``
How
curious
*NL*
of
my
cousin
Jarndyce
to
send
us
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
quite
confuses
me
.
I
want
to
understand
it
,
*NL*
and
I
ca
n't
understand
it
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
Ada
with
her
pretty
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I.
``
It
MUST
be
very
good
of
Mrs.
Jellyby
to
*NL*
take
such
pains
about
a
scheme
for
the
benefit
of
natives
--
and
*NL*
yet
--
Peepy
and
the
housekeeping
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
laughed
and
put
her
arm
about
my
neck
as
I
stood
looking
at
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
told
me
I
was
a
quiet
,
dear
,
good
creature
and
had
won
her
*NL*
heart
.
``
You
are
so
thoughtful
,
Esther
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
yet
so
*NL*
cheerful
!
And
you
do
so
much
,
so
unpretendingly
!
You
would
make
a
*NL*
home
out
of
even
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
simple
darling
!
She
was
quite
unconscious
that
she
only
praised
*NL*
herself
and
that
it
was
in
the
goodness
of
her
own
heart
that
she
*NL*
made
so
much
of
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
you
a
question
?
''
said
I
when
we
had
sat
before
the
fire
a
*NL*
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
hundred
,
''
said
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
cousin
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
I
owe
so
much
to
him
.
Would
you
mind
*NL*
describing
him
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shaking
her
golden
hair
,
Ada
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
with
such
*NL*
laughing
wonder
that
I
was
full
of
wonder
too
,
partly
at
her
beauty
,
*NL*
partly
at
her
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
a
description
of
my
cousin
Jarndyce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
I
never
saw
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
never
saw
him
!
''
returned
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
she
had
never
seen
him
.
Young
as
she
was
when
her
mama
died
,
she
*NL*
remembered
how
the
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
when
she
spoke
of
*NL*
him
and
of
the
noble
generosity
of
his
character
,
which
she
had
said
*NL*
was
to
be
trusted
above
all
earthly
things
;
and
Ada
trusted
it
.
Her
*NL*
cousin
Jarndyce
had
written
to
her
a
few
months
ago
--
``
a
plain
,
honest
*NL*
letter
,
''
Ada
said
--
proposing
the
arrangement
we
were
now
to
enter
on
*NL*
and
telling
her
that
``
in
time
it
might
heal
some
of
the
wounds
made
*NL*
by
the
miserable
Chancery
suit
.
''
She
had
replied
,
gratefully
*NL*
accepting
his
proposal
.
Richard
had
received
a
similar
letter
and
had
*NL*
made
a
similar
response
.
He
HAD
seen
Mr.
Jarndyce
once
,
but
only
*NL*
once
,
five
years
ago
,
at
Winchester
school
.
He
had
told
Ada
,
when
*NL*
they
were
leaning
on
the
screen
before
the
fire
where
I
found
them
,
*NL*
that
he
recollected
him
as
``
a
bluff
,
rosy
fellow
.
''
This
was
the
*NL*
utmost
description
Ada
could
give
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
set
me
thinking
so
that
when
Ada
was
asleep
,
I
still
remained
*NL*
before
the
fire
,
wondering
and
wondering
about
Bleak
House
,
and
*NL*
wondering
and
wondering
that
yesterday
morning
should
seem
so
long
*NL*
ago
.
I
do
n't
know
where
my
thoughts
had
wandered
when
they
were
*NL*
recalled
by
a
tap
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
opened
it
softly
and
found
Miss
Jellyby
shivering
there
with
a
*NL*
broken
candle
in
a
broken
candlestick
in
one
hand
and
an
egg-cup
in
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
!
''
she
said
very
sulkily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
in
?
''
she
shortly
and
unexpectedly
asked
me
in
the
same
*NL*
sulky
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
I.
``
Do
n't
wake
Miss
Clare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
sit
down
,
but
stood
by
the
fire
dipping
her
inky
middle
*NL*
finger
in
the
egg-cup
,
which
contained
vinegar
,
and
smearing
it
over
*NL*
the
ink
stains
on
her
face
,
frowning
the
whole
time
and
looking
very
*NL*
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Africa
was
dead
!
''
she
said
on
a
sudden
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
remonstrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
!
''
she
said
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
,
Miss
Summerson
.
I
hate
it
and
*NL*
detest
it
.
It
's
a
beast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
she
was
tired
,
and
I
was
sorry
.
I
put
my
hand
upon
her
*NL*
head
,
and
touched
her
forehead
,
and
said
it
was
hot
now
but
would
be
*NL*
cool
to-morrow
.
She
still
stood
pouting
and
frowning
at
me
,
but
*NL*
presently
put
down
her
egg-cup
and
turned
softly
towards
the
bed
*NL*
where
Ada
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
pretty
!
''
she
said
with
the
same
knitted
brow
and
in
the
*NL*
same
uncivil
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
assented
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
orphan
.
Ai
n't
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
knows
a
quantity
,
I
suppose
?
Can
dance
,
and
play
music
,
and
*NL*
sing
?
She
can
talk
French
,
I
suppose
,
and
do
geography
,
and
globes
,
*NL*
and
needlework
,
and
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
,
''
she
returned
.
``
I
ca
n't
do
anything
hardly
,
except
write
.
*NL*
I
'm
always
writing
for
Ma
.
I
wonder
you
two
were
not
ashamed
of
*NL*
yourselves
to
come
in
this
afternoon
and
see
me
able
to
do
nothing
*NL*
else
.
It
was
like
your
ill
nature
.
Yet
you
think
yourselves
very
*NL*
fine
,
I
dare
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
see
that
the
poor
girl
was
near
crying
,
and
I
resumed
my
*NL*
chair
without
speaking
and
looked
at
her
-LRB-
I
hope
-RRB-
as
mildly
as
I
felt
*NL*
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
disgraceful
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
know
it
is
.
The
whole
house
is
*NL*
disgraceful
.
The
children
are
disgraceful

I
'M
disgraceful

Pa
's
*NL*
miserable
,
and
no
wonder
!
Priscilla
drinks
--
she
's
always
drinking
.
*NL*
It
's
a
great
shame
and
a
great
story
of
you
if
you
say
you
did
n't
*NL*
smell
her
to-day
.
It
was
as
bad
as
a
public-house
,
waiting
at
dinner
;
*NL*
you
know
it
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
I
do
n't
know
it
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
,
''
she
said
very
shortly
.
``
You
sha
n't
say
you
do
n't
.
You
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
!
''
said
I.
``
If
you
wo
n't
let
me
speak

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
speaking
now

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
I
,
``
as
long
as

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

I
think

said
I
,
``
because
that
would
be
so
very

unreasonable

did
not
know
what

*NL*
not
come
near
me
at
dinner
;
but
I
do
n't
doubt
what
you
tell

and
I
*NL*
am
sorry
to
hear

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
make
a
merit
of
that

''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
dear
,
''
said
I.
``
That
would
be
very
foolish

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
standing
by
the
bed
,
and
now
stooped
down
-LRB-
but
still
*NL*
with
the
same
discontented
face
-RRB-
and
kissed
Ada
.
That
done
,
she
came
*NL*
softly
back
and
stood
by
the
side
of
my
chair
.
Her
bosom
was
heaving
*NL*
in
a
distressful
manner
that
I
greatly
pitied
,
but
I
thought
it
*NL*
better
not
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
was
dead
!
''
she
broke
out
.
``
I
wish
we
were
all
dead
.
It
*NL*
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
afterwards
,
she
knelt
on
the
ground
at
my
side
,
hid
her
*NL*
face
in
my
dress
,
passionately
begged
my
pardon
,
and
wept
.
I
*NL*
comforted
her
and
would
have
raised
her
,
but
she
cried
no
,
no
;
she
*NL*
wanted
to
stay
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
to
teach
girls
,
''
she
said
,
``
If
you
could
only
have
taught
*NL*
me
,
I
could
have
learnt
from
you
!
I
am
so
very
miserable
,
and
I
like
*NL*
you
so
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
persuade
her
to
sit
by
me
or
to
do
anything
but
move
a
*NL*
ragged
stool
to
where
she
was
kneeling
,
and
take
that
,
and
still
hold
*NL*
my
dress
in
the
same
manner
.
By
degrees
the
poor
tired
girl
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
and
then
I
contrived
to
raise
her
head
so
that
it
should
rest
*NL*
on
my
lap
,
and
to
cover
us
both
with
shawls
.
The
fire
went
out
,
and
*NL*
all
night
long
she
slumbered
thus
before
the
ashy
grate
.
At
first
I
*NL*
was
painfully
awake
and
vainly
tried
to
lose
myself
,
with
my
eyes
*NL*
closed
,
among
the
scenes
of
the
day
.
At
length
,
by
slow
degrees
,
they
*NL*
became
indistinct
and
mingled
.
I
began
to
lose
the
identity
of
the
*NL*
sleeper
resting
on
me
.
Now
it
was
Ada
,
now
one
of
my
old
Reading
*NL*
friends
from
whom
I
could
not
believe
I
had
so
recently
parted
.
Now
*NL*
it
was
the
little
mad
woman
worn
out
with
curtsying
and
smiling
,
now
*NL*
some
one
in
authority
at
Bleak
House
.
Lastly
,
it
was
no
one
,
and
I
*NL*
was
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
purblind
day
was
feebly
struggling
with
the
fog
when
I
opened
my
*NL*
eyes
to
encounter
those
of
a
dirty-faced
little
spectre
fixed
upon
*NL*
me
.
Peepy
had
scaled
his
crib
,
and
crept
down
in
his
bed-gown
and
*NL*
cap
,
and
was
so
cold
that
his
teeth
were
chattering
as
if
he
had
cut
*NL*
them
all
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
A
Morning
Adventure
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
morning
was
raw
,
and
although
the
fog
still
seemed
*NL*
heavy
--
I
say
seemed
,
for
the
windows
were
so
encrusted
with
dirt
that
*NL*
they
would
have
made
midsummer
sunshine
dim
--
I
was
sufficiently
*NL*
forewarned
of
the
discomfort
within
doors
at
that
early
hour
and
*NL*
sufficiently
curious
about
London
to
think
it
a
good
idea
on
the
part
*NL*
of
Miss
Jellyby
when
she
proposed
that
we
should
go
out
for
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
wo
n't
be
down
for
ever
so
long
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
then
it
's
a
*NL*
chance
if
breakfast
's
ready
for
an
hour
afterwards
,
they
dawdle
so
.
*NL*
As
to
Pa
,
he
gets
what
he
can
and
goes
to
the
office
.
He
never
has
*NL*
what
you
would
call
a
regular
breakfast
.
Priscilla
leaves
him
out
the
*NL*
loaf
and
some
milk
,
when
there
is
any
,
overnight
.
Sometimes
there
*NL*
is
n't
any
milk
,
and
sometimes
the
cat
drinks
it
.
But
I
'm
afraid
you
*NL*
must
be
tired
,
Miss
Summerson
,
and
perhaps
you
would
rather
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
at
all
tired
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
would
much
prefer
to
*NL*
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
sure
you
would
,
''
returned
Miss
Jellyby
,
``
I
'll
get
my
*NL*
things
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
said
she
would
go
too
,
and
was
soon
astir
.
I
made
a
proposal
to
*NL*
Peepy
,
in
default
of
being
able
to
do
anything
better
for
him
,
that
*NL*
he
should
let
me
wash
him
and
afterwards
lay
him
down
on
my
bed
*NL*
again
.
To
this
he
submitted
with
the
best
grace
possible
,
staring
at
*NL*
me
during
the
whole
operation
as
if
he
never
had
been
,
and
never
*NL*
could
again
be
,
so
astonished
in
his
life
--
looking
very
miserable
*NL*
also
,
certainly
,
but
making
no
complaint
,
and
going
snugly
to
sleep
*NL*
as
soon
as
it
was
over
.
At
first
I
was
in
two
minds
about
taking
such
*NL*
a
liberty
,
but
I
soon
reflected
that
nobody
in
the
house
was
likely
*NL*
to
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
with
the
bustle
of
dispatching
Peepy
and
the
bustle
of
getting
*NL*
myself
ready
and
helping
Ada
,
I
was
soon
quite
in
a
glow
.
We
found
*NL*
Miss
Jellyby
trying
to
warm
herself
at
the
fire
in
the
writing-room
,
*NL*
which
Priscilla
was
then
lighting
with
a
smutty
parlour
candlestick
,
*NL*
throwing
the
candle
in
to
make
it
burn
better
.
Everything
was
just
as
*NL*
we
had
left
it
last
night
and
was
evidently
intended
to
remain
so
.
*NL*
Below-stairs
the
dinner-cloth
had
not
been
taken
away
,
but
had
been
*NL*
left
ready
for
breakfast
.
Crumbs
,
dust
,
and
waste-paper
were
all
over
*NL*
the
house
.
Some
pewter
pots
and
a
milk-can
hung
on
the
area
railings
;
*NL*
the
door
stood
open
;
and
we
met
the
cook
round
the
corner
coming
out
*NL*
of
a
public-house
,
wiping
her
mouth
.
She
mentioned
,
as
she
passed
us
,
*NL*
that
she
had
been
to
see
what
o'clock
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
we
met
the
cook
,
we
met
Richard
,
who
was
dancing
up
and
*NL*
down
Thavies
Inn
to
warm
his
feet
.
He
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
*NL*
us
stirring
so
soon
and
said
he
would
gladly
share
our
walk
.
So
he
*NL*
took
care
of
Ada
,
and
Miss
Jellyby
and
I
went
first
.
I
may
mention
*NL*
that
Miss
Jellyby
had
relapsed
into
her
sulky
manner
and
that
I
*NL*
really
should
not
have
thought
she
liked
me
much
unless
she
had
told
*NL*
me
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
would
you
wish
to
go
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anywhere
,
my
dear
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anywhere
's
nowhere
,
''
said
Miss
Jellyby
,
stopping
perversely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
somewhere
at
any
rate
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
walked
me
on
very
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
!
''
she
said
.
``
Now
,
you
are
my
witness
,
Miss
Summerson
,
I
*NL*
say
I
do
n't
care
--
but
if
he
was
to
come
to
our
house
with
his
great
,
*NL*
shining
,
lumpy
forehead
night
after
night
till
he
was
as
old
as
*NL*
Methuselah
,
I
would
n't
have
anything
to
say
to
him
.
Such
ASSES
as
he
*NL*
and
Ma
make
of
themselves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
I
remonstrated
,
in
allusion
to
the
epithet
and
the
*NL*
vigorous
emphasis
Miss
Jellyby
set
upon
it
.
``
Your
duty
as
a
child
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Do
n't
talk
of
duty
as
a
child
,
Miss
Summerson
;
where
's
Ma
's
duty
*NL*
as
a
parent
?
All
made
over
to
the
public
and
Africa
,
I
suppose
!
Then
*NL*
let
the
public
and
Africa
show
duty
as
a
child
;
it
's
much
more
their
*NL*
affair
than
mine
.
You
are
shocked
,
I
dare
say
!
Very
well
,
so
am
I
*NL*
shocked
too
;
so
we
are
both
shocked
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
me
on
faster
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
all
that
,
I
say
again
,
he
may
come
,
and
come
,
and
come
,
and
*NL*
I
wo
n't
have
anything
to
say
to
him
.
I
ca
n't
bear
him
.
If
there
's
any
*NL*
stuff
in
the
world
that
I
hate
and
detest
,
it
's
the
stuff
he
and
Ma
*NL*
talk
.
I
wonder
the
very
paving-stones
opposite
our
house
can
have
the
*NL*
patience
to
stay
there
and
be
a
witness
of
such
inconsistencies
and
*NL*
contradictions
as
all
that
sounding
nonsense
,
and
Ma
's
management
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
but
understand
her
to
refer
to
Mr.
Quale
,
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
who
had
appeared
after
dinner
yesterday
.
I
was
saved
the
*NL*
disagreeable
necessity
of
pursuing
the
subject
by
Richard
and
Ada
*NL*
coming
up
at
a
round
pace
,
laughing
and
asking
us
if
we
meant
to
run
*NL*
a
race
.
Thus
interrupted
,
Miss
Jellyby
became
silent
and
walked
*NL*
moodily
on
at
my
side
while
I
admired
the
long
successions
and
*NL*
varieties
of
streets
,
the
quantity
of
people
already
going
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
the
number
of
vehicles
passing
and
repassing
,
the
busy
*NL*
preparations
in
the
setting
forth
of
shop
windows
and
the
sweeping
*NL*
out
of
shops
,
and
the
extraordinary
creatures
in
rags
secretly
*NL*
groping
among
the
swept-out
rubbish
for
pins
and
other
refuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
cousin
,
''
said
the
cheerful
voice
of
Richard
to
Ada
behind
me
.
*NL*
``
We
are
never
to
get
out
of
Chancery
!
We
have
come
by
another
way
to
*NL*
our
place
of
meeting
yesterday
,
and
--
by
the
Great
Seal
,
here
's
the
*NL*
old
lady
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Truly
,
there
she
was
,
immediately
in
front
of
us
,
curtsying
,
and
*NL*
smiling
,
and
saying
with
her
yesterday
's
air
of
patronage
,
``
The
wards
*NL*
in
Jarndyce
!
Ve-ry
happy
,
I
am
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
out
early
,
ma'am
,
''
said
I
as
she
curtsied
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es
!
I
usually
walk
here
early
.
Before
the
court
sits
.
It
's
*NL*
retired
.
I
collect
my
thoughts
here
for
the
business
of
the
day
,
''
*NL*
said
the
old
lady
mincingly
.
``
The
business
of
the
day
requires
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
thought
.
Chancery
justice
is
so
ve-ry
difficult
to
*NL*
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
this
,
Miss
Summerson
?
''
whispered
Miss
Jellyby
,
drawing
my
arm
*NL*
tighter
through
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
old
lady
's
hearing
was
remarkably
quick
.
She
answered
for
*NL*
herself
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
suitor
,
my
child
.
At
your
service
.
I
have
the
honour
to
attend
*NL*
court
regularly
.
With
my
documents
.
Have
I
the
pleasure
of
addressing
*NL*
another
of
the
youthful
parties
in
Jarndyce
?
''
said
the
old
lady
,
*NL*
recovering
herself
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
from
a
very
low
*NL*
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
,
anxious
to
atone
for
his
thoughtlessness
of
yesterday
,
*NL*
good-naturedly
explained
that
Miss
Jellyby
was
not
connected
with
the
*NL*
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
said
the
old
lady
.
``
She
does
not
expect
a
judgment
?
She
will
*NL*
still
grow
old
.
But
not
so
old
.
Oh
,
dear
,
no
!
This
is
the
garden
of
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
I
call
it
my
garden
.
It
is
quite
a
bower
in
the
*NL*
summer-time
.
Where
the
birds
sing
melodiously
.
I
pass
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
the
long
vacation
here
.
In
contemplation
.
You
find
the
long
*NL*
vacation
exceedingly
long
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
yes
,
as
she
seemed
to
expect
us
to
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
leaves
are
falling
from
the
trees
and
there
are
no
more
*NL*
flowers
in
bloom
to
make
up
into
nosegays
for
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
*NL*
court
,
''
said
the
old
lady
,
``
the
vacation
is
fulfilled
and
the
sixth
*NL*
seal
,
mentioned
in
the
Revelations
,
again
prevails
.
Pray
come
and
see
*NL*
my
lodging
.
It
will
be
a
good
omen
for
me
.
Youth
,
and
hope
,
and
*NL*
beauty
are
very
seldom
there
.
It
is
a
long
,
long
time
since
I
had
a
*NL*
visit
from
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
taken
my
hand
,
and
leading
me
and
Miss
Jellyby
away
,
beckoned
*NL*
Richard
and
Ada
to
come
too
.
I
did
not
know
how
to
excuse
myself
and
*NL*
looked
to
Richard
for
aid
.
As
he
was
half
amused
and
half
curious
and
*NL*
all
in
doubt
how
to
get
rid
of
the
old
lady
without
offence
,
she
*NL*
continued
to
lead
us
away
,
and
he
and
Ada
continued
to
follow
,
our
*NL*
strange
conductress
informing
us
all
the
time
,
with
much
smiling
*NL*
condescension
,
that
she
lived
close
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
true
,
as
it
soon
appeared
.
She
lived
so
close
by
that
we
*NL*
had
not
time
to
have
done
humouring
her
for
a
few
moments
before
she
*NL*
was
at
home
.
Slipping
us
out
at
a
little
side
gate
,
the
old
lady
*NL*
stopped
most
unexpectedly
in
a
narrow
back
street
,
part
of
some
*NL*
courts
and
lanes
immediately
outside
the
wall
of
the
inn
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
This
is
my
lodging
.
Pray
walk
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
stopped
at
a
shop
over
which
was
written
KROOK
,
RAG
AND
*NL*
BOTTLE
WAREHOUSE
.
Also
,
in
long
thin
letters
,
KROOK
,
DEALER
IN
MARINE
*NL*
STORES
.
In
one
part
of
the
window
was
a
picture
of
a
red
paper
mill
*NL*
at
which
a
cart
was
unloading
a
quantity
of
sacks
of
old
rags
.
In
*NL*
another
was
the
inscription
BONES
BOUGHT
.
In
another
,
KITCHEN-STUFF
*NL*
BOUGHT
.
In
another
,
OLD
IRON
BOUGHT
.
In
another
,
WASTE-PAPER
BOUGHT
.
*NL*
In
another
,
LADIES
'
AND
GENTLEMEN
'S
WARDROBES
BOUGHT
.
Everything
*NL*
seemed
to
be
bought
and
nothing
to
be
sold
there
.
In
all
parts
of
the
*NL*
window
were
quantities
of
dirty
bottles
--
blacking
bottles
,
medicine
*NL*
bottles
,
ginger-beer
and
soda-water
bottles
,
pickle
bottles
,
wine
*NL*
bottles
,
ink
bottles
;
I
am
reminded
by
mentioning
the
latter
that
the
*NL*
shop
had
in
several
little
particulars
the
air
of
being
in
a
legal
*NL*
neighbourhood
and
of
being
,
as
it
were
,
a
dirty
hanger-on
and
*NL*
disowned
relation
of
the
law
.
There
were
a
great
many
ink
bottles
.
*NL*
There
was
a
little
tottering
bench
of
shabby
old
volumes
outside
the
*NL*
door
,
labelled
``
Law
Books
,
all
at
9d
.
''
Some
of
the
inscriptions
I
*NL*
have
enumerated
were
written
in
law-hand
,
like
the
papers
I
had
seen
*NL*
in
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
office
and
the
letters
I
had
so
long
received
*NL*
from
the
firm
.
Among
them
was
one
,
in
the
same
writing
,
having
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
of
the
shop
,
but
announcing
that
a
*NL*
respectable
man
aged
forty-five
wanted
engrossing
or
copying
to
*NL*
execute
with
neatness
and
dispatch
:
Address
to
Nemo
,
care
of
Mr.
*NL*
Krook
,
within
.
There
were
several
second-hand
bags
,
blue
and
red
,
*NL*
hanging
up
.
A
little
way
within
the
shop-door
lay
heaps
of
old
*NL*
crackled
parchment
scrolls
and
discoloured
and
dog
's
-
eared
*NL*
law-papers
.
I
could
have
fancied
that
all
the
rusty
keys
,
of
which
*NL*
there
must
have
been
hundreds
huddled
together
as
old
iron
,
had
once
*NL*
belonged
to
doors
of
rooms
or
strong
chests
in
lawyers
'
offices
.
The
*NL*
litter
of
rags
tumbled
partly
into
and
partly
out
of
a
one-legged
*NL*
wooden
scale
,
hanging
without
any
counterpoise
from
a
beam
,
might
*NL*
have
been
counsellors
'
bands
and
gowns
torn
up
.
One
had
only
to
*NL*
fancy
,
as
Richard
whispered
to
Ada
and
me
while
we
all
stood
looking
*NL*
in
,
that
yonder
bones
in
a
corner
,
piled
together
and
picked
very
*NL*
clean
,
were
the
bones
of
clients
,
to
make
the
picture
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
was
still
foggy
and
dark
,
and
as
the
shop
was
blinded
besides
*NL*
by
the
wall
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
intercepting
the
light
within
a
couple
*NL*
of
yards
,
we
should
not
have
seen
so
much
but
for
a
lighted
lantern
*NL*
that
an
old
man
in
spectacles
and
a
hairy
cap
was
carrying
about
in
*NL*
the
shop
.
Turning
towards
the
door
,
he
now
caught
sight
of
us
.
He
was
*NL*
short
,
cadaverous
,
and
withered
,
with
his
head
sunk
sideways
between
*NL*
his
shoulders
and
the
breath
issuing
in
visible
smoke
from
his
mouth
*NL*
as
if
he
were
on
fire
within
.
His
throat
,
chin
,
and
eyebrows
were
so
*NL*
frosted
with
white
hairs
and
so
gnarled
with
veins
and
puckered
skin
*NL*
that
he
looked
from
his
breast
upward
like
some
old
root
in
a
fall
of
*NL*
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,
hi
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
coming
to
the
door
.
``
Have
you
anything
to
*NL*
sell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
naturally
drew
back
and
glanced
at
our
conductress
,
who
had
been
*NL*
trying
to
open
the
house-door
with
a
key
she
had
taken
from
her
*NL*
pocket
,
and
to
whom
Richard
now
said
that
as
we
had
had
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
seeing
where
she
lived
,
we
would
leave
her
,
being
pressed
for
*NL*
time
.
But
she
was
not
to
be
so
easily
left
.
She
became
so
*NL*
fantastically
and
pressingly
earnest
in
her
entreaties
that
we
would
*NL*
walk
up
and
see
her
apartment
for
an
instant
,
and
was
so
bent
,
in
her
*NL*
harmless
way
,
on
leading
me
in
,
as
part
of
the
good
omen
she
desired
,
*NL*
that
I
-LRB-
whatever
the
others
might
do
-RRB-
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
*NL*
comply
.
I
suppose
we
were
all
more
or
less
curious
;
at
any
rate
,
when
*NL*
the
old
man
added
his
persuasions
to
hers
and
said
,
``
Aye
,
aye
!
Please
*NL*
her
!
It
wo
n't
take
a
minute
!
Come
in
,
come
in
!
Come
in
through
the
*NL*
shop
if
t
`
other
door
's
out
of
order
!
''
we
all
went
in
,
stimulated
by
*NL*
Richard
's
laughing
encouragement
and
relying
on
his
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
landlord
,
Krook
,
''
said
the
little
old
lady
,
condescending
to
him
*NL*
from
her
lofty
station
as
she
presented
him
to
us
.
``
He
is
called
*NL*
among
the
neighbours
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
His
shop
is
called
the
*NL*
Court
of
Chancery
.
He
is
a
very
eccentric
person
.
He
is
very
odd
.
Oh
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
he
is
very
odd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
a
great
many
times
and
tapped
her
forehead
with
*NL*
her
finger
to
express
to
us
that
we
must
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
*NL*
him
,
``
For
he
is
a
little
--
you
know
--
M
!
''
said
the
old
lady
with
great
*NL*
stateliness
.
The
old
man
overheard
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
enough
,
''
he
said
,
going
before
us
with
the
lantern
,
``
that
*NL*
they
call
me
the
Lord
Chancellor
and
call
my
shop
Chancery
.
And
why
*NL*
do
you
think
they
call
me
the
Lord
Chancellor
and
my
shop
Chancery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
I
am
sure
!
''
said
Richard
rather
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
stopping
and
turning
round
,
``
they
--
Hi
!
*NL*
Here
's
lovely
hair
!
I
have
got
three
sacks
of
ladies
'
hair
below
,
but
*NL*
none
so
beautiful
and
fine
as
this
.
What
colour
,
and
what
texture
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
,
my
good
friend
!
''
said
Richard
,
strongly
disapproving
of
*NL*
his
having
drawn
one
of
Ada
's
tresses
through
his
yellow
hand
.
``
You
*NL*
can
admire
as
the
rest
of
us
do
without
taking
that
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
darted
at
him
a
sudden
look
which
even
called
my
*NL*
attention
from
Ada
,
who
,
startled
and
blushing
,
was
so
remarkably
*NL*
beautiful
that
she
seemed
to
fix
the
wandering
attention
of
the
*NL*
little
old
lady
herself
.
But
as
Ada
interposed
and
laughingly
said
*NL*
she
could
only
feel
proud
of
such
genuine
admiration
,
Mr.
Krook
*NL*
shrunk
into
his
former
self
as
suddenly
as
he
had
leaped
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
have
so
many
things
here
,
''
he
resumed
,
holding
up
the
*NL*
lantern
,
``
of
so
many
kinds
,
and
all
as
the
neighbours
think
-LRB-
but
THEY
*NL*
know
nothing
-RRB-
,
wasting
away
and
going
to
rack
and
ruin
,
that
that
's
*NL*
why
they
have
given
me
and
my
place
a
christening
.
And
I
have
so
many
*NL*
old
parchmentses
and
papers
in
my
stock
.
And
I
have
a
liking
for
rust
*NL*
and
must
and
cobwebs
.
And
all
's
fish
that
comes
to
my
net
.
And
I
*NL*
ca
n't
abear
to
part
with
anything
I
once
lay
hold
of
-LRB-
or
so
my
*NL*
neighbours
think
,
but
what
do
THEY
know
?
-RRB-
or
to
alter
anything
,
or
to
*NL*
have
any
sweeping
,
nor
scouring
,
nor
cleaning
,
nor
repairing
going
on
*NL*
about
me
.
That
's
the
way
I
've
got
the
ill
name
of
Chancery
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
mind
.
I
go
to
see
my
noble
and
learned
brother
pretty
well
every
day
,
*NL*
when
he
sits
in
the
Inn
.
He
do
n't
notice
me
,
but
I
notice
him
.
*NL*
There
's
no
great
odds
betwixt
us
.
We
both
grub
on
in
a
muddle
.
Hi
,
*NL*
Lady
Jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
grey
cat
leaped
from
some
neighbouring
shelf
on
his
shoulder
*NL*
and
startled
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
!
Show
'em
how
you
scratch
.
Hi
!
Tear
,
my
lady
!
''
said
her
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cat
leaped
down
and
ripped
at
a
bundle
of
rags
with
her
tigerish
*NL*
claws
,
with
a
sound
that
it
set
my
teeth
on
edge
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
do
as
much
for
any
one
I
was
to
set
her
on
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
``
I
deal
in
cat-skins
among
other
general
matters
,
and
hers
was
*NL*
offered
to
me
.
It
's
a
very
fine
skin
,
as
you
may
see
,
but
I
did
n't
*NL*
have
it
stripped
off
!
THAT
war
n't
like
Chancery
practice
though
,
says
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
by
this
time
led
us
across
the
shop
,
and
now
opened
a
door
in
*NL*
the
back
part
of
it
,
leading
to
the
house-entry
.
As
he
stood
with
his
*NL*
hand
upon
the
lock
,
the
little
old
lady
graciously
observed
to
him
*NL*
before
passing
out
,
``
That
will
do
,
Krook
.
You
mean
well
,
but
are
*NL*
tiresome

My
young
friends
are
pressed
for
time

I
have
none
to
spare
*NL*
myself
,
having
to
attend
court
very
soon
.
My
young
friends
are
the
*NL*
wards
in
Jarndyce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jarndyce
!
''
said
the
old
man
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce

The
great
suit
,
Krook
,

returned
his
lodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
!
''
exclaimed
the
old
man
in
a
tone
of
thoughtful
amazement
and
*NL*
with
a
wider
stare
than
before
.
``
Think
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
so
rapt
all
in
a
moment
and
looked
so
curiously
at
us
that
*NL*
Richard
said
,
``
Why
,
you
appear
to
trouble
yourself
a
good
deal
about
*NL*
the
causes
before
your
noble
and
learned
brother
,
the
other
*NL*
Chancellor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
old
man
abstractedly
.
``
Sure
!
YOUR
name
now
will
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
Carstone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carstone
,
''
he
repeated
,
slowly
checking
off
that
name
upon
his
*NL*
forefinger
;
and
each
of
the
others
he
went
on
to
mention
upon
a
*NL*
separate
finger
.
``
Yes
.
There
was
the
name
of
Barbary
,
and
the
name
of
*NL*
Clare
,
and
the
name
of
Dedlock
,
too
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
as
much
of
the
cause
as
the
real
salaried
Chancellor

said
*NL*
Richard
,
quite
astonished
,
to
Ada
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
coming
slowly
out
of
his
abstraction
.
``
Yes
!
*NL*
Tom
Jarndyce
--
you
'll
excuse
me
,
being
related
;
but
he
was
never
known
*NL*
about
court
by
any
other
name
,
and
was
as
well
known
there
as
--
she
is
*NL*
now
,
''
nodding
slightly
at
his
lodger
.
``
Tom
Jarndyce
was
often
in
*NL*
here
.
He
got
into
a
restless
habit
of
strolling
about
when
the
cause
*NL*
was
on
,
or
expected
,
talking
to
the
little
shopkeepers
and
telling
*NL*
'em
to
keep
out
of
Chancery
,
whatever
they
did
.
`
For
,
'
says
he
,
`
it
's
*NL*
being
ground
to
bits
in
a
slow
mill
;
it
's
being
roasted
at
a
slow
*NL*
fire
;
it
's
being
stung
to
death
by
single
bees
;
it
's
being
drowned
by
*NL*
drops
;
it
's
going
mad
by
grains

He
was
as
near
making
away
with
*NL*
himself
,
just
where
the
young
lady
stands
,
as
near
could
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
listened
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
come
in
at
the
door
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
slowly
pointing
an
*NL*
imaginary
track
along
the
shop
,
``
on
the
day
he
did
it
--
the
whole
*NL*
neighbourhood
had
said
for
months
before
that
he
would
do
it
,
of
a
*NL*
certainty
sooner
or
later
--
he
come
in
at
the
door
that
day
,
and
*NL*
walked
along
there
,
and
sat
himself
on
a
bench
that
stood
there
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
-LRB-
you
'll
judge
I
was
a
mortal
sight
younger
then
-RRB-
to
fetch
*NL*
him
a
pint
of
wine
.
`
For
,
'
says
he
,
`
Krook
,
I
am
much
depressed
;
my
*NL*
cause
is
on
again
,
and
I
think
I
'm
nearer
judgment
than
I
ever
was
.
'
*NL*
I
had
n't
a
mind
to
leave
him
alone
;
and
I
persuaded
him
to
go
to
the
*NL*
tavern
over
the
way
there
,
t
`
other
side
my
lane
-LRB-
I
mean
Chancery
*NL*
Lane
-RRB-
;
and
I
followed
and
looked
in
at
the
window
,
and
saw
him
,
*NL*
comfortable
as
I
thought
,
in
the
arm-chair
by
the
fire
,
and
company
*NL*
with
him
.
I
had
n't
hardly
got
back
here
when
I
heard
a
shot
go
*NL*
echoing
and
rattling
right
away
into
the
inn
.
I
ran
out
--
neighbours
*NL*
ran
out
--
twenty
of
us
cried
at
once
,
`
Tom
Jarndyce
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
stopped
,
looked
hard
at
us
,
looked
down
into
the
lantern
,
*NL*
blew
the
light
out
,
and
shut
the
lantern
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
right
,
I
need
n't
tell
the
present
hearers
.
Hi
!
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
how
the
neighbourhood
poured
into
court
that
afternoon
while
the
*NL*
cause
was
on
!
How
my
noble
and
learned
brother
,
and
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
'em
,
grubbed
and
muddled
away
as
usual
and
tried
to
look
as
if
they
*NL*
had
n't
heard
a
word
of
the
last
fact
in
the
case
or
as
if
they
*NL*
had
--
Oh
,
dear
me
!
--
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
if
they
had
heard
of
*NL*
it
by
any
chance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
's
colour
had
entirely
left
her
,
and
Richard
was
scarcely
less
*NL*
pale
.
Nor
could
I
wonder
,
judging
even
from
my
emotions
,
and
I
was
no
*NL*
party
in
the
suit
,
that
to
hearts
so
untried
and
fresh
it
was
a
shock
*NL*
to
come
into
the
inheritance
of
a
protracted
misery
,
attended
in
the
*NL*
minds
of
many
people
with
such
dreadful
recollections
.
I
had
another
*NL*
uneasiness
,
in
the
application
of
the
painful
story
to
the
poor
*NL*
half-witted
creature
who
had
brought
us
there
;
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
*NL*
she
seemed
perfectly
unconscious
of
that
and
only
led
the
way
*NL*
upstairs
again
,
informing
us
with
the
toleration
of
a
superior
*NL*
creature
for
the
infirmities
of
a
common
mortal
that
her
landlord
was
*NL*
``
a
little
M
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lived
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
in
a
pretty
large
room
,
from
which
*NL*
she
had
a
glimpse
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
Hall
.
This
seemed
to
have
been
her
*NL*
principal
inducement
,
originally
,
for
taking
up
her
residence
there
.
*NL*
She
could
look
at
it
,
she
said
,
in
the
night
,
especially
in
the
*NL*
moonshine
.
Her
room
was
clean
,
but
very
,
very
bare
.
I
noticed
the
*NL*
scantiest
necessaries
in
the
way
of
furniture
;
a
few
old
prints
from
*NL*
books
,
of
Chancellors
and
barristers
,
wafered
against
the
wall
;
and
*NL*
some
half-dozen
reticles
and
work-bags
,
``
containing
documents
,
''
as
*NL*
she
informed
us
.
There
were
neither
coals
nor
ashes
in
the
grate
,
and
*NL*
I
saw
no
articles
of
clothing
anywhere
,
nor
any
kind
of
food
.
Upon
a
*NL*
shelf
in
an
open
cupboard
were
a
plate
or
two
,
a
cup
or
two
,
and
so
*NL*
forth
,
but
all
dry
and
empty
.
There
was
a
more
affecting
meaning
in
*NL*
her
pinched
appearance
,
I
thought
as
I
looked
round
,
than
I
had
*NL*
understood
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extremely
honoured
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
our
poor
hostess
with
the
*NL*
greatest
suavity
,
``
by
this
visit
from
the
wards
in
Jarndyce
.
And
very
*NL*
much
indebted
for
the
omen
.
It
is
a
retired
situation
.
Considering
.
I
*NL*
am
limited
as
to
situation
.
In
consequence
of
the
necessity
of
*NL*
attending
on
the
Chancellor
.
I
have
lived
here
many
years
.
I
pass
my
*NL*
days
in
court
,
my
evenings
and
my
nights
here
.
I
find
the
nights
*NL*
long
,
for
I
sleep
but
little
and
think
much
.
That
is
,
of
course
,
*NL*
unavoidable
,
being
in
Chancery
.
I
am
sorry
I
can
not
offer
chocolate
.
*NL*
I
expect
a
judgment
shortly
and
shall
then
place
my
establishment
on
*NL*
a
superior
footing
.
At
present
,
I
do
n't
mind
confessing
to
the
wards
*NL*
in
Jarndyce
-LRB-
in
strict
confidence
-RRB-
that
I
sometimes
find
it
difficult
*NL*
to
keep
up
a
genteel
appearance
.
I
have
felt
the
cold
here
.
I
have
*NL*
felt
something
sharper
than
cold
.
It
matters
very
little
.
Pray
excuse
*NL*
the
introduction
of
such
mean
topics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
partly
drew
aside
the
curtain
of
the
long
,
low
garret
window
and
*NL*
called
our
attention
to
a
number
of
bird-cages
hanging
there
,
some
*NL*
containing
several
birds
.
There
were
larks
,
linnets
,
and
*NL*
goldfinches
--
I
should
think
at
least
twenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
began
to
keep
the
little
creatures
,
''
she
said
,
``
with
an
object
*NL*
that
the
wards
will
readily
comprehend
.
With
the
intention
of
*NL*
restoring
them
to
liberty
.
When
my
judgment
should
be
given
.
Ye-es
!
*NL*
They
die
in
prison
,
though
.
Their
lives
,
poor
silly
things
,
are
so
*NL*
short
in
comparison
with
Chancery
proceedings
that
,
one
by
one
,
the
*NL*
whole
collection
has
died
over
and
over
again
.
I
doubt
,
do
you
know
,
*NL*
whether
one
of
these
,
though
they
are
all
young
,
will
live
to
be
*NL*
free
!
Ve-ry
mortifying
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
she
sometimes
asked
a
question
,
she
never
seemed
to
expect
a
*NL*
reply
,
but
rambled
on
as
if
she
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
when
no
*NL*
one
but
herself
was
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
I
positively
doubt
sometimes
,
I
do
assure
*NL*
you
,
whether
while
matters
are
still
unsettled
,
and
the
sixth
or
*NL*
Great
Seal
still
prevails
,
I
may
not
one
day
be
found
lying
stark
and
*NL*
senseless
here
,
as
I
have
found
so
many
birds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
,
answering
what
he
saw
in
Ada
's
compassionate
eyes
,
took
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
laying
some
money
,
softly
and
unobserved
,
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
We
all
drew
nearer
to
the
cages
,
feigning
to
examine
*NL*
the
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
allow
them
to
sing
much
,
''
said
the
little
old
lady
,
``
for
*NL*
-LRB-
you
'll
think
this
curious
-RRB-
I
find
my
mind
confused
by
the
idea
that
*NL*
they
are
singing
while
I
am
following
the
arguments
in
court
.
And
my
*NL*
mind
requires
to
be
so
very
clear
,
you
know
!
Another
time
,
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
their
names
.
Not
at
present
.
On
a
day
of
such
good
omen
,
they
*NL*
shall
sing
as
much
as
they
like

In
honour
of
youth

a
smile
and
*NL*
curtsy
,
``
hope

''
a
smile
and
curtsy

``

a
smile

curtsy

*NL*
``
There
!
We
'll
let
in

*NL*
*NL*
The
birds
began
to
stir
and
chirp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
admit
the
air
freely
,
''
said
the
little
old
lady
--
the
room
*NL*
was
close
,
and
would
have
been
the
better
for
it
--
``
because
the
cat
*NL*
you
saw
downstairs
,
called
Lady
Jane
,
is
greedy
for
their
lives
.
She
*NL*
crouches
on
the
parapet
outside
for
hours
and
hours
.
I
have
*NL*
discovered
,
''
whispering
mysteriously
,
``
that
her
natural
cruelty
is
*NL*
sharpened
by
a
jealous
fear
of
their
regaining
their
liberty
.
In
*NL*
consequence
of
the
judgment
I
expect
being
shortly
given
.
She
is
sly
*NL*
and
full
of
malice
.
I
half
believe
,
sometimes
,
that
she
is
no
cat
,
*NL*
but
the
wolf
of
the
old
saying
.
It
is
so
very
difficult
to
keep
her
*NL*
from
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
neighbouring
bells
,
reminding
the
poor
soul
that
it
was
*NL*
half-past
nine
,
did
more
for
us
in
the
way
of
bringing
our
visit
to
*NL*
an
end
than
we
could
easily
have
done
for
ourselves
.
She
hurriedly
*NL*
took
up
her
little
bag
of
documents
,
which
she
had
laid
upon
the
*NL*
table
on
coming
in
,
and
asked
if
we
were
also
going
into
court
.
On
*NL*
our
answering
no
,
and
that
we
would
on
no
account
detain
her
,
she
*NL*
opened
the
door
to
attend
us
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
such
an
omen
,
it
is
even
more
necessary
than
usual
that
I
*NL*
should
be
there
before
the
Chancellor
comes
in
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
he
*NL*
might
mention
my
case
the
first
thing
.
I
have
a
presentiment
that
he
*NL*
WILL
mention
it
the
first
thing
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
to
tell
us
in
a
whisper
as
we
were
going
down
that
the
*NL*
whole
house
was
filled
with
strange
lumber
which
her
landlord
had
*NL*
bought
piecemeal
and
had
no
wish
to
sell
,
in
consequence
of
being
a
*NL*
little
M
.
This
was
on
the
first
floor
.
But
she
had
made
a
previous
*NL*
stoppage
on
the
second
floor
and
had
silently
pointed
at
a
dark
door
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
other
lodger
,
''
she
now
whispered
in
explanation
,
``
a
*NL*
law-writer
.
The
children
in
the
lanes
here
say
he
has
sold
himself
to
*NL*
the
devil
.
I
do
n't
know
what
he
can
have
done
with
the
money
.
Hush
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
to
mistrust
that
the
lodger
might
hear
her
even
there
,
*NL*
and
repeating
``
Hush
!
''
went
before
us
on
tiptoe
as
though
even
the
*NL*
sound
of
her
footsteps
might
reveal
to
him
what
she
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
through
the
shop
on
our
way
out
,
as
we
had
passed
through
it
*NL*
on
our
way
in
,
we
found
the
old
man
storing
a
quantity
of
packets
of
*NL*
waste-paper
in
a
kind
of
well
in
the
floor
.
He
seemed
to
be
working
*NL*
hard
,
with
the
perspiration
standing
on
his
forehead
,
and
had
a
piece
*NL*
of
chalk
by
him
,
with
which
,
as
he
put
each
separate
package
or
*NL*
bundle
down
,
he
made
a
crooked
mark
on
the
panelling
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
and
Ada
,
and
Miss
Jellyby
,
and
the
little
old
lady
had
gone
*NL*
by
him
,
and
I
was
going
when
he
touched
me
on
the
arm
to
stay
me
,
and
*NL*
chalked
the
letter
J
upon
the
wall
--
in
a
very
curious
manner
,
*NL*
beginning
with
the
end
of
the
letter
and
shaping
it
backward
.
It
was
*NL*
a
capital
letter
,
not
a
printed
one
,
but
just
such
a
letter
as
any
*NL*
clerk
in
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
office
would
have
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
read
it
?
''
he
asked
me
with
a
keen
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
said
I.
``
It
's
very
plain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
J.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
another
glance
at
me
,
and
a
glance
at
the
door
,
he
rubbed
it
out
*NL*
and
turned
an
``
a
''
in
its
place
-LRB-
not
a
capital
letter
this
time
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
.
He
then
rubbed
that
out
and
turned
the
letter
``
r
,
''
and
*NL*
asked
me
the
same
question
.
He
went
on
quickly
until
he
had
formed
in
*NL*
the
same
curious
manner
,
beginning
at
the
ends
and
bottoms
of
the
*NL*
letters
,
the
word
Jarndyce
,
without
once
leaving
two
letters
on
the
*NL*
wall
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
spell
?
''
he
asked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
told
him
,
he
laughed
.
In
the
same
odd
way
,
yet
with
the
same
*NL*
rapidity
,
he
then
produced
singly
,
and
rubbed
out
singly
,
the
letters
*NL*
forming
the
words
Bleak
House
.
These
,
in
some
astonishment
,
I
also
*NL*
read
;
and
he
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
laying
aside
the
chalk
.
``
I
have
a
turn
for
*NL*
copying
from
memory
,
you
see
,
miss
,
though
I
can
neither
read
nor
*NL*
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
disagreeable
and
his
cat
looked
so
wickedly
at
me
,
as
if
*NL*
I
were
a
blood-relation
of
the
birds
upstairs
,
that
I
was
quite
*NL*
relieved
by
Richard
's
appearing
at
the
door
and
saying
,
``
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
I
hope
you
are
not
bargaining
for
the
sale
of
your
hair
.
*NL*
Do
n't
be
tempted
.
Three
sacks
below
are
quite
enough
for
Mr.
Krook
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
lost
no
time
in
wishing
Mr.
Krook
good
morning
and
joining
my
*NL*
friends
outside
,
where
we
parted
with
the
little
old
lady
,
who
gave
*NL*
us
her
blessing
with
great
ceremony
and
renewed
her
assurance
of
*NL*
yesterday
in
reference
to
her
intention
of
settling
estates
on
Ada
*NL*
and
me
.
Before
we
finally
turned
out
of
those
lanes
,
we
looked
back
*NL*
and
saw
Mr.
Krook
standing
at
his
shop-door
,
in
his
spectacles
,
*NL*
looking
after
us
,
with
his
cat
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
her
tail
*NL*
sticking
up
on
one
side
of
his
hairy
cap
like
a
tall
feather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
an
adventure
for
a
morning
in
London
!
''
said
Richard
with
a
*NL*
sigh
.
``
Ah
,
cousin
,
cousin
,
it
's
a
weary
word
this
Chancery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
to
me
,
and
has
been
ever
since
I
can
remember
,
''
returned
Ada
.
*NL*
``
I
am
grieved
that
I
should
be
the
enemy
--
as
I
suppose
I
am
--
of
a
*NL*
great
number
of
relations
and
others
,
and
that
they
should
be
my
*NL*
enemies
--
as
I
suppose
they
are
--
and
that
we
should
all
be
ruining
one
*NL*
another
without
knowing
how
or
why
and
be
in
constant
doubt
and
*NL*
discord
all
our
lives
.
It
seems
very
strange
,
as
there
must
be
right
*NL*
somewhere
,
that
an
honest
judge
in
real
earnest
has
not
been
able
to
*NL*
find
out
through
all
these
years
where
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
cousin
!
''
said
Richard
.
``
Strange
,
indeed
!
All
this
wasteful
,
*NL*
wanton
chess-playing
IS
very
strange
.
To
see
that
composed
court
*NL*
yesterday
jogging
on
so
serenely
and
to
think
of
the
wretchedness
of
*NL*
the
pieces
on
the
board
gave
me
the
headache
and
the
heartache
both
*NL*
together
.
My
head
ached
with
wondering
how
it
happened
,
if
men
were
*NL*
neither
fools
nor
rascals
;
and
my
heart
ached
to
think
they
could
*NL*
possibly
be
either
.
But
at
all
events
,
Ada
--
I
may
call
you
Ada
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
may
,
cousin
Richard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
Chancery
will
work
none
of
its
bad
influences
on
US
.
*NL*
We
have
happily
been
brought
together
,
thanks
to
our
good
kinsman
,
*NL*
and
it
ca
n't
divide
us
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
I
hope
,
cousin
Richard
!
''
said
Ada
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Jellyby
gave
my
arm
a
squeeze
and
me
a
very
significant
look
.
I
*NL*
smiled
in
return
,
and
we
made
the
rest
of
the
way
back
very
*NL*
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
after
our
arrival
,
Mrs.
Jellyby
appeared
;
and
in
the
*NL*
course
of
an
hour
the
various
things
necessary
for
breakfast
*NL*
straggled
one
by
one
into
the
dining-room
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
had
gone
to
bed
and
got
up
in
the
usual
manner
,
but
she
*NL*
presented
no
appearance
of
having
changed
her
dress
.
She
was
greatly
*NL*
occupied
during
breakfast
,
for
the
morning
's
post
brought
a
heavy
*NL*
correspondence
relative
to
Borrioboola-Gha
,
which
would
occasion
her
*NL*
-LRB-
she
said
-RRB-
to
pass
a
busy
day
.
The
children
tumbled
about
,
and
*NL*
notched
memoranda
of
their
accidents
in
their
legs
,
which
were
*NL*
perfect
little
calendars
of
distress
;
and
Peepy
was
lost
for
an
hour
*NL*
and
a
half
,
and
brought
home
from
Newgate
market
by
a
policeman
.
The
*NL*
equable
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Jellyby
sustained
both
his
absence
and
*NL*
his
restoration
to
the
family
circle
surprised
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
by
that
time
perseveringly
dictating
to
Caddy
,
and
Caddy
was
*NL*
fast
relapsing
into
the
inky
condition
in
which
we
had
found
her
.
At
*NL*
one
o'clock
an
open
carriage
arrived
for
us
,
and
a
cart
for
our
*NL*
luggage
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
charged
us
with
many
remembrances
to
her
good
*NL*
friend
Mr.
Jarndyce
;
Caddy
left
her
desk
to
see
us
depart
,
kissed
me
*NL*
in
the
passage
,
and
stood
biting
her
pen
and
sobbing
on
the
steps
;
*NL*
Peepy
,
I
am
happy
to
say
,
was
asleep
and
spared
the
pain
of
*NL*
separation
-LRB-
I
was
not
without
misgivings
that
he
had
gone
to
Newgate
*NL*
market
in
search
of
me
-RRB-
;
and
all
the
other
children
got
up
behind
the
*NL*
barouche
and
fell
off
,
and
we
saw
them
,
with
great
concern
,
scattered
*NL*
over
the
surface
of
Thavies
Inn
as
we
rolled
out
of
its
precincts
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
at
Home
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
brightened
very
much
,
and
still
brightened
as
we
went
*NL*
westward
.
We
went
our
way
through
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
air
,
*NL*
wondering
more
and
more
at
the
extent
of
the
streets
,
the
brilliancy
*NL*
of
the
shops
,
the
great
traffic
,
and
the
crowds
of
people
whom
the
*NL*
pleasanter
weather
seemed
to
have
brought
out
like
many-coloured
*NL*
flowers
.
By
and
by
we
began
to
leave
the
wonderful
city
and
to
*NL*
proceed
through
suburbs
which
,
of
themselves
,
would
have
made
a
*NL*
pretty
large
town
in
my
eyes
;
and
at
last
we
got
into
a
real
country
*NL*
road
again
,
with
windmills
,
rick-yards
,
milestones
,
farmers
'
waggons
,
*NL*
scents
of
old
hay
,
swinging
signs
,
and
horse
troughs
:
trees
,
fields
,
*NL*
and
hedge-rows
.
It
was
delightful
to
see
the
green
landscape
before
*NL*
us
and
the
immense
metropolis
behind
;
and
when
a
waggon
with
a
train
*NL*
of
beautiful
horses
,
furnished
with
red
trappings
and
clear-sounding
*NL*
bells
,
came
by
us
with
its
music
,
I
believe
we
could
all
three
have
*NL*
sung
to
the
bells
,
so
cheerful
were
the
influences
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
road
has
been
reminding
me
of
my
namesake
Whittington
,
''
*NL*
said
Richard
,
``
and
that
waggon
is
the
finishing
touch
.
Halloa
!
What
's
*NL*
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
stopped
,
and
the
waggon
had
stopped
too
.
Its
music
changed
as
*NL*
the
horses
came
to
a
stand
,
and
subsided
to
a
gentle
tinkling
,
except
*NL*
when
a
horse
tossed
his
head
or
shook
himself
and
sprinkled
off
a
*NL*
little
shower
of
bell-ringing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
postilion
is
looking
after
the
waggoner
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
and
the
*NL*
waggoner
is
coming
back
after
us
.
Good
day
,
friend
!
''
The
waggoner
was
*NL*
at
our
coach-door
.
``
Why
,
here
's
an
extraordinary
thing
!
''
added
*NL*
Richard
,
looking
closely
at
the
man
.
``
He
has
got
your
name
,
Ada
,
in
*NL*
his
hat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
all
our
names
in
his
hat
.
Tucked
within
the
band
were
three
*NL*
small
notes
--
one
addressed
to
Ada
,
one
to
Richard
,
one
to
me
.
These
*NL*
the
waggoner
delivered
to
each
of
us
respectively
,
reading
the
name
*NL*
aloud
first
.
In
answer
to
Richard
's
inquiry
from
whom
they
came
,
he
*NL*
briefly
answered
,
``
Master
,
sir
,
if
you
please
''
;
and
putting
on
his
*NL*
hat
again
-LRB-
which
was
like
a
soft
bowl
-RRB-
,
cracked
his
whip
,
re-awakened
*NL*
his
music
,
and
went
melodiously
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
Mr.
Jarndyce
's
waggon
?
''
said
Richard
,
calling
to
our
*NL*
post-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Going
to
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
opened
the
notes
.
Each
was
a
counterpart
of
the
other
and
*NL*
contained
these
words
in
a
solid
,
plain
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
look
forward
,
my
dear
,
to
our
meeting
easily
and
*NL*
without
constraint
on
either
side
.
I
therefore
have
to
*NL*
propose
that
we
meet
as
old
friends
and
take
the
past
for
*NL*
granted
.
It
will
be
a
relief
to
you
possibly
,
and
to
me
*NL*
certainly
,
and
so
my
love
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Jarndyce
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
perhaps
less
reason
to
be
surprised
than
either
of
my
*NL*
companions
,
having
never
yet
enjoyed
an
opportunity
of
thanking
one
*NL*
who
had
been
my
benefactor
and
sole
earthly
dependence
through
so
*NL*
many
years
.
I
had
not
considered
how
I
could
thank
him
,
my
gratitude
*NL*
lying
too
deep
in
my
heart
for
that
;
but
I
now
began
to
consider
how
*NL*
I
could
meet
him
without
thanking
him
,
and
felt
it
would
be
very
*NL*
difficult
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notes
revived
in
Richard
and
Ada
a
general
impression
that
they
*NL*
both
had
,
without
quite
knowing
how
they
came
by
it
,
that
their
*NL*
cousin
Jarndyce
could
never
bear
acknowledgments
for
any
kindness
he
*NL*
performed
and
that
sooner
than
receive
any
he
would
resort
to
the
*NL*
most
singular
expedients
and
evasions
or
would
even
run
away
.
Ada
*NL*
dimly
remembered
to
have
heard
her
mother
tell
,
when
she
was
a
very
*NL*
little
child
,
that
he
had
once
done
her
an
act
of
uncommon
generosity
*NL*
and
that
on
her
going
to
his
house
to
thank
him
,
he
happened
to
see
*NL*
her
through
a
window
coming
to
the
door
,
and
immediately
escaped
by
*NL*
the
back
gate
,
and
was
not
heard
of
for
three
months
.
This
discourse
*NL*
led
to
a
great
deal
more
on
the
same
theme
,
and
indeed
it
lasted
us
*NL*
all
day
,
and
we
talked
of
scarcely
anything
else
.
If
we
did
by
any
*NL*
chance
diverge
into
another
subject
,
we
soon
returned
to
this
,
and
*NL*
wondered
what
the
house
would
be
like
,
and
when
we
should
get
there
,
*NL*
and
whether
we
should
see
Mr.
Jarndyce
as
soon
as
we
arrived
or
after
*NL*
a
delay
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
us
,
and
what
we
should
say
to
him
.
*NL*
All
of
which
we
wondered
about
,
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
roads
were
very
heavy
for
the
horses
,
but
the
pathway
was
*NL*
generally
good
,
so
we
alighted
and
walked
up
all
the
hills
,
and
liked
*NL*
it
so
well
that
we
prolonged
our
walk
on
the
level
ground
when
we
got
*NL*
to
the
top
.
At
Barnet
there
were
other
horses
waiting
for
us
,
but
as
*NL*
they
had
only
just
been
fed
,
we
had
to
wait
for
them
too
,
and
got
a
*NL*
long
fresh
walk
over
a
common
and
an
old
battle-field
before
the
*NL*
carriage
came
up
.
These
delays
so
protracted
the
journey
that
the
*NL*
short
day
was
spent
and
the
long
night
had
closed
in
before
we
came
*NL*
to
St.
Albans
,
near
to
which
town
Bleak
House
was
,
we
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
time
we
were
so
anxious
and
nervous
that
even
Richard
*NL*
confessed
,
as
we
rattled
over
the
stones
of
the
old
street
,
to
*NL*
feeling
an
irrational
desire
to
drive
back
again
.
As
to
Ada
and
me
,
*NL*
whom
he
had
wrapped
up
with
great
care
,
the
night
being
sharp
and
*NL*
frosty
,
we
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
When
we
turned
out
of
the
*NL*
town
,
round
a
corner
,
and
Richard
told
us
that
the
post-boy
,
who
had
*NL*
for
a
long
time
sympathized
with
our
heightened
expectation
,
was
*NL*
looking
back
and
nodding
,
we
both
stood
up
in
the
carriage
-LRB-
Richard
*NL*
holding
Ada
lest
she
should
be
jolted
down
-RRB-
and
gazed
round
upon
the
*NL*
open
country
and
the
starlight
night
for
our
destination
.
There
was
a
*NL*
light
sparkling
on
the
top
of
a
hill
before
us
,
and
the
driver
,
*NL*
pointing
to
it
with
his
whip
and
crying
,
``
That
's
Bleak
House
!
''
put
*NL*
his
horses
into
a
canter
and
took
us
forward
at
such
a
rate
,
uphill
*NL*
though
it
was
,
that
the
wheels
sent
the
road
drift
flying
about
our
*NL*
heads
like
spray
from
a
water-mill
.
Presently
we
lost
the
light
,
*NL*
presently
saw
it
,
presently
lost
it
,
presently
saw
it
,
and
turned
*NL*
into
an
avenue
of
trees
and
cantered
up
towards
where
it
was
beaming
*NL*
brightly
.
It
was
in
a
window
of
what
seemed
to
be
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
house
with
three
peaks
in
the
roof
in
front
and
a
circular
sweep
*NL*
leading
to
the
porch
.
A
bell
was
rung
as
we
drew
up
,
and
amidst
the
*NL*
sound
of
its
deep
voice
in
the
still
air
,
and
the
distant
barking
of
*NL*
some
dogs
,
and
a
gush
of
light
from
the
opened
door
,
and
the
smoking
*NL*
and
steaming
of
the
heated
horses
,
and
the
quickened
beating
of
our
*NL*
own
hearts
,
we
alighted
in
no
inconsiderable
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ada
,
my
love
,
Esther
,
my
dear
,
you
are
welcome
.
I
rejoice
to
see
*NL*
you
!
Rick
,
if
I
had
a
hand
to
spare
at
present
,
I
would
give
it
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
who
said
these
words
in
a
clear
,
bright
,
hospitable
*NL*
voice
had
one
of
his
arms
round
Ada
's
waist
and
the
other
round
mine
,
*NL*
and
kissed
us
both
in
a
fatherly
way
,
and
bore
us
across
the
hall
*NL*
into
a
ruddy
little
room
,
all
in
a
glow
with
a
blazing
fire
.
Here
he
*NL*
kissed
us
again
,
and
opening
his
arms
,
made
us
sit
down
side
by
side
*NL*
on
a
sofa
ready
drawn
out
near
the
hearth
.
I
felt
that
if
we
had
been
*NL*
at
all
demonstrative
,
he
would
have
run
away
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Rick
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
a
hand
at
liberty
.
A
word
in
earnest
is
*NL*
as
good
as
a
speech
.
I
am
heartily
glad
to
see
you
.
You
are
at
home
.
*NL*
Warm
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
shook
him
by
both
hands
with
an
intuitive
mixture
of
respect
*NL*
and
frankness
,
and
only
saying
-LRB-
though
with
an
earnestness
that
*NL*
rather
alarmed
me
,
I
was
so
afraid
of
Mr.
Jarndyce
's
suddenly
*NL*
disappearing
-RRB-
,
``
You
are
very
kind
,
sir
!
We
are
very
much
obliged
to
*NL*
you
!
''
laid
aside
his
hat
and
coat
and
came
up
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
you
like
the
ride
?
And
how
did
you
like
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
my
*NL*
dear
?
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
to
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Ada
was
speaking
to
him
in
reply
,
I
glanced
-LRB-
I
need
not
say
*NL*
with
how
much
interest
-RRB-
at
his
face
.
It
was
a
handsome
,
lively
,
quick
*NL*
face
,
full
of
change
and
motion
;
and
his
hair
was
a
silvered
*NL*
iron-grey
.
I
took
him
to
be
nearer
sixty
than
fifty
,
but
he
was
*NL*
upright
,
hearty
,
and
robust
.
From
the
moment
of
his
first
speaking
to
*NL*
us
his
voice
had
connected
itself
with
an
association
in
my
mind
that
*NL*
I
could
not
define
;
but
now
,
all
at
once
,
a
something
sudden
in
his
*NL*
manner
and
a
pleasant
expression
in
his
eyes
recalled
the
gentleman
*NL*
in
the
stagecoach
six
years
ago
on
the
memorable
day
of
my
journey
to
*NL*
Reading
.
I
was
certain
it
was
he
.
I
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
*NL*
life
as
when
I
made
the
discovery
,
for
he
caught
my
glance
,
and
*NL*
appearing
to
read
my
thoughts
,
gave
such
a
look
at
the
door
that
I
*NL*
thought
we
had
lost
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
am
happy
to
say
he
remained
where
he
was
,
and
asked
me
*NL*
what
I
thought
of
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
exerts
herself
very
much
for
Africa
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobly
!
''
returned
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
But
you
answer
like
Ada
.
''
Whom
I
had
*NL*
not
heard
.
``
You
all
think
something
else
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
rather
thought
,
''
said
I
,
glancing
at
Richard
and
Ada
,
who
*NL*
entreated
me
with
their
eyes
to
speak
,
``
that
perhaps
she
was
a
little
*NL*
unmindful
of
her
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Floored
!
''
cried
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
rather
alarmed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
I
want
to
know
your
real
thoughts
,
my
dear
.
I
may
have
sent
*NL*
you
there
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
that
,
perhaps
,
''
said
I
,
hesitating
,
``
it
is
right
to
begin
*NL*
with
the
obligations
of
home
,
sir
;
and
that
,
perhaps
,
while
those
are
*NL*
overlooked
and
neglected
,
no
other
duties
can
possibly
be
substituted
*NL*
for
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
Jellybys

said
Richard
,
coming
to
my
relief
,
``
are
*NL*
really

I
ca
n't
help
expressing
myself
strongly

in
a
devil
of

state

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
means
well

said
Mr.
Jarndyce
hastily
.
``
The
wind
's
in
the

east

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
in

north

came
down

observed
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
poking
the
fire
,
``
I
'll
take
an
*NL*
oath
it
's
either
in

east

going

conscious
of

an
uncomfortable
sensation
now

wind
is
blowing
in

east

``
Rheumatism

Richard

dare

had
my

in

*NL*
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
two
or
three
undecided
turns
up
and
down
while
uttering
*NL*
these
broken
sentences
,
retaining
the
poker
in
one
hand
and
rubbing
*NL*
his
hair
with
the
other
,
with
a
good-natured
vexation
at
once
so
*NL*
whimsical
and
so
lovable
that
I
am
sure
we
were
more
delighted
with
*NL*
him
than
we
could
possibly
have
expressed
in
any
words
.
He
gave
an
*NL*
arm
to
Ada
and
an
arm
to
me
,
and
bidding
Richard
bring
a
candle
,
was
*NL*
leading
the
way
out
when
he
suddenly
turned
us
all
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
little
Jellybys

Could
n't
you

did
n't
you

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

Ada
hastily
began

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

Ada
laughingly

*NL*
``

said
Mr.

with
great
enjoyment

*NL*
``
Sounds

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*

Mr.

``
What
did
Esther

*NL*
*NL*

Why

said
Ada
,
clasping
her
hands
upon
his
arm
and
*NL*
shaking
her
head
at
me
across
him
--
for
I
wanted
her
to
be
*NL*
quiet

``
Esther

their
friend
directly

Esther
nursed

told

quiet

My

gone
out

was
found

softened

No

You

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
warm-hearted
darling
leaned
across
her
cousin
John
and
kissed
me
,
*NL*
and
then
looking
up
in
his
face
,
boldly
said
,
``
At
all
events
,
cousin
*NL*
John
,
I
WILL
thank
you
for
the
companion
you
have
given

''
I
felt
*NL*
as
if
she
challenged
him
to
run
away
.
But
he
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
say
the
wind
was
,
Rick
?
''
asked
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
north
as
we
came
down
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
.
There
's
no
east
in
it
.
A
mistake
of
mine
.
Come
,
*NL*
girls
,
come
and
see
your
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
delightfully
irregular
houses
where
you
go
up
and
*NL*
down
steps
out
of
one
room
into
another
,
and
where
you
come
upon
more
*NL*
rooms
when
you
think
you
have
seen
all
there
are
,
and
where
there
is
*NL*
a
bountiful
provision
of
little
halls
and
passages
,
and
where
you
*NL*
find
still
older
cottage-rooms
in
unexpected
places
with
lattice
*NL*
windows
and
green
growth
pressing
through
them
.
Mine
,
which
we
*NL*
entered
first
,
was
of
this
kind
,
with
an
up-and-down
roof
that
had
*NL*
more
corners
in
it
than
I
ever
counted
afterwards
and
a
chimney
*NL*
-LRB-
there
was
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
-RRB-
paved
all
around
with
pure
*NL*
white
tiles
,
in
every
one
of
which
a
bright
miniature
of
the
fire
was
*NL*
blazing
.
Out
of
this
room
,
you
went
down
two
steps
into
a
charming
*NL*
little
sitting-room
looking
down
upon
a
flower-garden
,
which
room
was
*NL*
henceforth
to
belong
to
Ada
and
me
.
Out
of
this
you
went
up
three
*NL*
steps
into
Ada
's
bedroom
,
which
had
a
fine
broad
window
commanding
a
*NL*
beautiful
view
-LRB-
we
saw
a
great
expanse
of
darkness
lying
underneath
*NL*
the
stars
-RRB-
,
to
which
there
was
a
hollow
window-seat
,
in
which
,
with
a
*NL*
spring-lock
,
three
dear
Adas
might
have
been
lost
at
once
.
Out
of
*NL*
this
room
you
passed
into
a
little
gallery
,
with
which
the
other
best
*NL*
rooms
-LRB-
only
two
-RRB-
communicated
,
and
so
,
by
a
little
staircase
of
*NL*
shallow
steps
with
a
number
of
corner
stairs
in
it
,
considering
its
*NL*
length
,
down
into
the
hall
.
But
if
instead
of
going
out
at
Ada
's
door
*NL*
you
came
back
into
my
room
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
by
which
you
had
*NL*
entered
it
,
and
turned
up
a
few
crooked
steps
that
branched
off
in
an
*NL*
unexpected
manner
from
the
stairs
,
you
lost
yourself
in
passages
,
*NL*
with
mangles
in
them
,
and
three-cornered
tables
,
and
a
native
Hindu
*NL*
chair
,
which
was
also
a
sofa
,
a
box
,
and
a
bedstead
,
and
looked
in
*NL*
every
form
something
between
a
bamboo
skeleton
and
a
great
bird-cage
,
*NL*
and
had
been
brought
from
India
nobody
knew
by
whom
or
when
.
From
*NL*
these
you
came
on
Richard
's
room
,
which
was
part
library
,
part
*NL*
sitting-room
,
part
bedroom
,
and
seemed
indeed
a
comfortable
compound
*NL*
of
many
rooms
.
Out
of
that
you
went
straight
,
with
a
little
interval
*NL*
of
passage
,
to
the
plain
room
where
Mr.
Jarndyce
slept
,
all
the
year
*NL*
round
,
with
his
window
open
,
his
bedstead
without
any
furniture
*NL*
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
more
air
,
and
his
cold
bath
*NL*
gaping
for
him
in
a
smaller
room
adjoining
.
Out
of
that
you
came
into
*NL*
another
passage
,
where
there
were
back-stairs
and
where
you
could
*NL*
hear
the
horses
being
rubbed
down
outside
the
stable
and
being
told
*NL*
to
``
Hold
up
''
and
``
Get
over
,
''
as
they
slipped
about
very
much
on
the
*NL*
uneven
stones
.
Or
you
might
,
if
you
came
out
at
another
door
-LRB-
every
*NL*
room
had
at
least
two
doors
-RRB-
,
go
straight
down
to
the
hall
again
by
*NL*
half-a-dozen
steps
and
a
low
archway
,
wondering
how
you
got
back
*NL*
there
or
had
ever
got
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
furniture
,
old-fashioned
rather
than
old
,
like
the
house
,
was
as
*NL*
pleasantly
irregular
.
Ada
's
sleeping-room
was
all
flowers
--
in
chintz
*NL*
and
paper
,
in
velvet
,
in
needlework
,
in
the
brocade
of
two
stiff
*NL*
courtly
chairs
which
stood
,
each
attended
by
a
little
page
of
a
stool
*NL*
for
greater
state
,
on
either
side
of
the
fire-place
.
Our
sitting-room
*NL*
was
green
and
had
framed
and
glazed
upon
the
walls
numbers
of
*NL*
surprising
and
surprised
birds
,
staring
out
of
pictures
at
a
real
*NL*
trout
in
a
case
,
as
brown
and
shining
as
if
it
had
been
served
with
*NL*
gravy
;
at
the
death
of
Captain
Cook
;
and
at
the
whole
process
of
*NL*
preparing
tea
in
China
,
as
depicted
by
Chinese
artists
.
In
my
room
*NL*
there
were
oval
engravings
of
the
months
--
ladies
haymaking
in
short
*NL*
waists
and
large
hats
tied
under
the
chin
,
for
June
;
smooth-legged
*NL*
noblemen
pointing
with
cocked-hats
to
village
steeples
,
for
October
.
*NL*
Half-length
portraits
in
crayons
abounded
all
through
the
house
,
but
*NL*
were
so
dispersed
that
I
found
the
brother
of
a
youthful
officer
of
*NL*
mine
in
the
china-closet
and
the
grey
old
age
of
my
pretty
young
*NL*
bride
,
with
a
flower
in
her
bodice
,
in
the
breakfast-room
.
As
*NL*
substitutes
,
I
had
four
angels
,
of
Queen
Anne
's
reign
,
taking
a
*NL*
complacent
gentleman
to
heaven
,
in
festoons
,
with
some
difficulty
;
*NL*
and
a
composition
in
needlework
representing
fruit
,
a
kettle
,
and
an
*NL*
alphabet
.
All
the
movables
,
from
the
wardrobes
to
the
chairs
and
*NL*
tables
,
hangings
,
glasses
,
even
to
the
pincushions
and
scent-bottles
*NL*
on
the
dressing-tables
,
displayed
the
same
quaint
variety
.
They
*NL*
agreed
in
nothing
but
their
perfect
neatness
,
their
display
of
the
*NL*
whitest
linen
,
and
their
storing-up
,
wheresoever
the
existence
of
a
*NL*
drawer
,
small
or
large
,
rendered
it
possible
,
of
quantities
of
*NL*
rose-leaves
and
sweet
lavender
.
Such
,
with
its
illuminated
windows
,
*NL*
softened
here
and
there
by
shadows
of
curtains
,
shining
out
upon
the
*NL*
starlight
night
;
with
its
light
,
and
warmth
,
and
comfort
;
with
its
*NL*
hospitable
jingle
,
at
a
distance
,
of
preparations
for
dinner
;
with
*NL*
the
face
of
its
generous
master
brightening
everything
we
saw
;
and
*NL*
just
wind
enough
without
to
sound
a
low
accompaniment
to
everything
*NL*
we
heard
,
were
our
first
impressions
of
Bleak
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
like
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
when
he
had
brought
us
*NL*
round
again
to
Ada
's
sitting-room
.
``
It
makes
no
pretensions
,
but
it
*NL*
is
a
comfortable
little
place
,
I
hope
,
and
will
be
more
so
with
such
*NL*
bright
young
looks
in
it
.
You
have
barely
half
an
hour
before
dinner
.
*NL*
There
's
no
one
here
but
the
finest
creature
upon
earth
--
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
children
,
Esther
!
''
said
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
literally
a
child
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Jarndyce
;
``
not
a
child
*NL*
in
years
.
He
is
grown
up
--
he
is
at
least
as
old
as
I
am
--
but
in
*NL*
simplicity
,
and
freshness
,
and
enthusiasm
,
and
a
fine
guileless
*NL*
inaptitude
for
all
worldly
affairs
,
he
is
a
perfect
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
felt
that
he
must
be
very
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
He
is
a
musical
man

an

amateur

might
have
been
a
professional

He

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
imply
that
he
has
children
of
his

inquired
*NL*
Richard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Half-a-dozen

Nearer

has
never

How
could

He
wanted
somebody

look
after

said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have

inquired
*NL*
Richard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

just
as
you
may
suppose

said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
his
countenance
*NL*
suddenly
falling
.
``
It
is
said
that
the

very
poor

dragged
up

Skimpole

tumbled
up

's
getting
round
again

I
am

afraid

I
feel
it
rather

*NL*
*NL*
Richard
observed
that
the
situation
was
exposed
on
a
sharp
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
IS
exposed

''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
No
doubt
that
's
the
cause

Come
along

*NL*
*NL*
Our
luggage
having
arrived
and
being
all
at
hand
,
I
was
dressed
in
a
*NL*
few
minutes
and
engaged
in
putting
my
worldly
goods
away
when
a
maid
*NL*
-LRB-
not
the
one
in
attendance
upon
Ada
,
but
another
,
whom
I
had
not
*NL*
seen
-RRB-
brought
a
basket
into
my
room
with
two
bunches
of
keys
in
it
,
*NL*
all
labelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you

said
she

*NL*

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
housekeeping
keys

*NL*
*NL*
I
showed
my
surprise

for
she
added
with
some
little
surprise
on
her
*NL*
own
part
,
``
I
was
told
to
bring
them
as
soon

I.

*NL*
``
The
large

Any
time
you
was
pleased
to
appoint
to-morrow
morning
,
*NL*
I
was
to
show
you
the
presses
and
things
they
belong
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
would
be
ready
at
half-past
six
,
and
after
she
was
gone
,
*NL*
stood
looking
at
the
basket
,
quite
lost
in
the
magnitude
of
my
trust
.
*NL*
Ada
found
me
thus
and
had
such
a
delightful
confidence
in
me
when
I
*NL*
showed
her
the
keys
and
told
her
about
them
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
insensibility
and
ingratitude
not
to
feel
encouraged
.
I
knew
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
that
it
was
the
dear
girl
's
kindness
,
but
I
liked
to
be
so
*NL*
pleasantly
cheated
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
went
downstairs
,
we
were
presented
to
Mr.
Skimpole
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
before
the
fire
telling
Richard
how
fond
he
used
to
be
,
in
*NL*
his
school-time
,
of
football
.
He
was
a
little
bright
creature
with
a
*NL*
rather
large
head
,
but
a
delicate
face
and
a
sweet
voice
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
perfect
charm
in
him
.
All
he
said
was
so
free
from
effort
and
*NL*
spontaneous
and
was
said
with
such
a
captivating
gaiety
that
it
was
*NL*
fascinating
to
hear
him
talk
.
Being
of
a
more
slender
figure
than
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
having
a
richer
complexion
,
with
browner
hair
,
he
looked
*NL*
younger
.
Indeed
,
he
had
more
the
appearance
in
all
respects
of
a
*NL*
damaged
young
man
than
a
well-preserved
elderly
one
.
There
was
an
*NL*
easy
negligence
in
his
manner
and
even
in
his
dress
-LRB-
his
hair
*NL*
carelessly
disposed
,
and
his
neckkerchief
loose
and
flowing
,
as
I
*NL*
have
seen
artists
paint
their
own
portraits
-RRB-
which
I
could
not
*NL*
separate
from
the
idea
of
a
romantic
youth
who
had
undergone
some
*NL*
unique
process
of
depreciation
.
It
struck
me
as
being
not
at
all
like
*NL*
the
manner
or
appearance
of
a
man
who
had
advanced
in
life
by
the
*NL*
usual
road
of
years
,
cares
,
and
experiences
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gathered
from
the
conversation
that
Mr.
Skimpole
had
been
educated
*NL*
for
the
medical
profession
and
had
once
lived
,
in
his
professional
*NL*
capacity
,
in
the
household
of
a
German
prince
.
He
told
us
,
however
,
*NL*
that
as
he
had
always
been
a
mere
child
in
point
of
weights
and
*NL*
measures
and
had
never
known
anything
about
them
-LRB-
except
that
they
*NL*
disgusted
him
-RRB-
,
he
had
never
been
able
to
prescribe
with
the
*NL*
requisite
accuracy
of
detail
.
In
fact
,
he
said
,
he
had
no
head
for
*NL*
detail
.
And
he
told
us
,
with
great
humour
,
that
when
he
was
wanted
to
*NL*
bleed
the
prince
or
physic
any
of
his
people
,
he
was
generally
found
*NL*
lying
on
his
back
in
bed
,
reading
the
newspapers
or
making
*NL*
fancy-sketches
in
pencil
,
and
could
n't
come
.
The
prince
,
at
last
,
*NL*
objecting
to
this
,
``
in
which
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
in
the
frankest
*NL*
manner
,
``
he
was
perfectly
right
,
''
the
engagement
terminated
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
having
-LRB-
as
he
added
with
delightful
gaiety
-RRB-
``
nothing
to
live
*NL*
upon
but
love
,
fell
in
love
,
and
married
,
and
surrounded
himself
with
*NL*
rosy
cheeks
.
''
His
good
friend
Jarndyce
and
some
other
of
his
good
*NL*
friends
then
helped
him
,
in
quicker
or
slower
succession
,
to
several
*NL*
openings
in
life
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
for
he
must
confess
to
two
of
*NL*
the
oldest
infirmities
in
the
world
:
one
was
that
he
had
no
idea
of
*NL*
time
,
the
other
that
he
had
no
idea
of
money
.
In
consequence
of
which
*NL*
he
never
kept
an
appointment
,
never
could
transact
any
business
,
and
*NL*
never
knew
the
value
of
anything
!
Well
!
So
he
had
got
on
in
life
,
and
*NL*
here
he
was
!
He
was
very
fond
of
reading
the
papers
,
very
fond
of
*NL*
making
fancy-sketches
with
a
pencil
,
very
fond
of
nature
,
very
fond
*NL*
of
art
.
All
he
asked
of
society
was
to
let
him
live
.
THAT
was
n't
*NL*
much
.
His
wants
were
few
.
Give
him
the
papers
,
conversation
,
music
,
*NL*
mutton
,
coffee
,
landscape
,
fruit
in
the
season
,
a
few
sheets
of
*NL*
Bristol-board
,
and
a
little
claret
,
and
he
asked
no
more
.
He
was
a
*NL*
mere
child
in
the
world
,
but
he
did
n't
cry
for
the
moon
.
He
said
to
*NL*
the
world
,
``
Go
your
several
ways
in
peace
!
Wear
red
coats
,
blue
*NL*
coats
,
lawn
sleeves
;
put
pens
behind
your
ears
,
wear
aprons
;
go
after
*NL*
glory
,
holiness
,
commerce
,
trade
,
any
object
you
prefer
;
only
--
let
*NL*
Harold
Skimpole
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
and
a
great
deal
more
he
told
us
,
not
only
with
the
*NL*
utmost
brilliancy
and
enjoyment
,
but
with
a
certain
vivacious
*NL*
candour
--
speaking
of
himself
as
if
he
were
not
at
all
his
own
affair
,
*NL*
as
if
Skimpole
were
a
third
person
,
as
if
he
knew
that
Skimpole
had
*NL*
his
singularities
but
still
had
his
claims
too
,
which
were
the
*NL*
general
business
of
the
community
and
must
not
be
slighted
.
He
was
*NL*
quite
enchanting
.
If
I
felt
at
all
confused
at
that
early
time
in
*NL*
endeavouring
to
reconcile
anything
he
said
with
anything
I
had
*NL*
thought
about
the
duties
and
accountabilities
of
life
-LRB-
which
I
am
far
*NL*
from
sure
of
-RRB-
,
I
was
confused
by
not
exactly
understanding
why
he
was
*NL*
free
of
them
.
That
he
WAS
free
of
them
,
I
scarcely
doubted
;
he
was
so
*NL*
very
clear
about
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
covet
nothing
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
in
the
same
light
way
.
*NL*
``
Possession
is
nothing
to
me
.
Here
is
my
friend
Jarndyce
's
excellent
*NL*
house
.
I
feel
obliged
to
him
for
possessing
it
.
I
can
sketch
it
and
*NL*
alter
it
.
I
can
set
it
to
music
.
When
I
am
here
,
I
have
sufficient
*NL*
possession
of
it
and
have
neither
trouble
,
cost
,
nor
responsibility
.
*NL*
My
steward
's
name
,
in
short
,
is
Jarndyce
,
and
he
ca
n't
cheat
me
.
We
*NL*
have
been
mentioning
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
There
is
a
bright-eyed
woman
,
of
a
*NL*
strong
will
and
immense
power
of
business
detail
,
who
throws
herself
*NL*
into
objects
with
surprising
ardour
!
I
do
n't
regret
that
I
have
not
a
*NL*
strong
will
and
an
immense
power
of
business
detail
to
throw
myself
*NL*
into
objects
with
surprising
ardour
.
I
can
admire
her
without
envy
.
I
*NL*
can
sympathize
with
the
objects
.
I
can
dream
of
them
.
I
can
lie
down
*NL*
on
the
grass
--
in
fine
weather
--
and
float
along
an
African
river
,
*NL*
embracing
all
the
natives
I
meet
,
as
sensible
of
the
deep
silence
and
*NL*
sketching
the
dense
overhanging
tropical
growth
as
accurately
as
if
I
*NL*
were
there
.
I
do
n't
know
that
it
's
of
any
direct
use
my
doing
so
,
but
*NL*
it
's
all
I
can
do
,
and
I
do
it
thoroughly
.
Then
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
*NL*
having
Harold
Skimpole
,
a
confiding
child
,
petitioning
you
,
the
*NL*
world
,
an
agglomeration
of
practical
people
of
business
habits
,
to
*NL*
let
him
live
and
admire
the
human
family
,
do
it
somehow
or
other
,
*NL*
like
good
souls
,
and
suffer
him
to
ride
his
rocking-horse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
enough
that
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
not
been
neglectful
of
the
*NL*
adjuration
.
Mr.
Skimpole
's
general
position
there
would
have
rendered
*NL*
it
so
without
the
addition
of
what
he
presently
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
you
,
the
generous
creatures
,
whom
I
envy
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
,
addressing
us
,
his
new
friends
,
in
an
impersonal
manner
.
``
I
*NL*
envy
you
your
power
of
doing
what
you
do
.
It
is
what
I
should
revel
*NL*
in
myself
.
I
do
n't
feel
any
vulgar
gratitude
to
you
.
I
almost
feel
as
*NL*
if
YOU
ought
to
be
grateful
to
ME
for
giving
you
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
enjoying
the
luxury
of
generosity
.
I
know
you
like
it
.
For
anything
I
*NL*
can
tell
,
I
may
have
come
into
the
world
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
increasing
your
stock
of
happiness
.
I
may
have
been
born
to
be
a
*NL*
benefactor
to
you
by
sometimes
giving
you
an
opportunity
of
assisting
*NL*
me
in
my
little
perplexities
.
Why
should
I
regret
my
incapacity
for
*NL*
details
and
worldly
affairs
when
it
leads
to
such
pleasant
*NL*
consequences
?
I
do
n't
regret
it
therefore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
his
playful
speeches
-LRB-
playful
,
yet
always
fully
meaning
what
*NL*
they
expressed
-RRB-
none
seemed
to
be
more
to
the
taste
of
Mr.
Jarndyce
*NL*
than
this
.
I
had
often
new
temptations
,
afterwards
,
to
wonder
whether
*NL*
it
was
really
singular
,
or
only
singular
to
me
,
that
he
,
who
was
*NL*
probably
the
most
grateful
of
mankind
upon
the
least
occasion
,
should
*NL*
so
desire
to
escape
the
gratitude
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
enchanted
.
I
felt
it
a
merited
tribute
to
the
engaging
*NL*
qualities
of
Ada
and
Richard
that
Mr.
Skimpole
,
seeing
them
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
should
be
so
unreserved
and
should
lay
himself
out
to
be
*NL*
so
exquisitely
agreeable
.
They
-LRB-
and
especially
Richard
-RRB-
were
*NL*
naturally
pleased
,
for
similar
reasons
,
and
considered
it
no
common
*NL*
privilege
to
be
so
freely
confided
in
by
such
an
attractive
man
.
The
*NL*
more
we
listened
,
the
more
gaily
Mr.
Skimpole
talked
.
And
what
with
*NL*
his
fine
hilarious
manner
and
his
engaging
candour
and
his
genial
way
*NL*
of
lightly
tossing
his
own
weaknesses
about
,
as
if
he
had
said
,
``
I
am
*NL*
a
child
,
you
know
!
You
are
designing
people
compared
with
me
''
-LRB-
he
*NL*
really
made
me
consider
myself
in
that
light
-RRB-
``
but
I
am
gay
and
*NL*
innocent
;
forget
your
worldly
arts
and
play
with
me
!
''
the
effect
was
*NL*
absolutely
dazzling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
full
of
feeling
too
and
had
such
a
delicate
sentiment
for
*NL*
what
was
beautiful
or
tender
that
he
could
have
won
a
heart
by
that
*NL*
alone
.
In
the
evening
,
when
I
was
preparing
to
make
tea
and
Ada
was
*NL*
touching
the
piano
in
the
adjoining
room
and
softly
humming
a
tune
to
*NL*
her
cousin
Richard
,
which
they
had
happened
to
mention
,
he
came
and
*NL*
sat
down
on
the
sofa
near
me
and
so
spoke
of
Ada
that
I
almost
loved
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
like
the
morning
,
''
he
said
.
``
With
that
golden
hair
,
those
*NL*
blue
eyes
,
and
that
fresh
bloom
on
her
cheek
,
she
is
like
the
summer
*NL*
morning
.
The
birds
here
will
mistake
her
for
it
.
We
will
not
call
*NL*
such
a
lovely
young
creature
as
that
,
who
is
a
joy
to
all
mankind
,
an
*NL*
orphan
.
She
is
the
child
of
the
universe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
I
found
,
was
standing
near
us
with
his
hands
behind
him
*NL*
and
an
attentive
smile
upon
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
universe
,
''
he
observed
,
``
makes
rather
an
indifferent
parent
,
I
*NL*
am
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
!
''
cried
Mr.
Skimpole
buoyantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
You
know
the
world
-LRB-
which
in
your
sense
*NL*
is
the
universe
-RRB-
,
and
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
so
you
shall
have
your
*NL*
way
.
But
if
I
had
mine
,
''
glancing
at
the
cousins
,
``
there
should
be
no
*NL*
brambles
of
sordid
realities
in
such
a
path
as
that
.
It
should
be
*NL*
strewn
with
roses
;
it
should
lie
through
bowers
,
where
there
was
no
*NL*
spring
,
autumn
,
nor
winter
,
but
perpetual
summer
.
Age
or
change
*NL*
should
never
wither
it
.
The
base
word
money
should
never
be
breathed
*NL*
near
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
patted
him
on
the
head
with
a
smile
,
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
really
a
child
,
and
passing
a
step
or
two
on
,
and
stopping
a
moment
,
*NL*
glanced
at
the
young
cousins
.
His
look
was
thoughtful
,
but
had
a
*NL*
benignant
expression
in
it
which
I
often
-LRB-
how
often
!
-RRB-
saw
again
,
*NL*
which
has
long
been
engraven
on
my
heart
.
The
room
in
which
they
*NL*
were
,
communicating
with
that
in
which
he
stood
,
was
only
lighted
by
*NL*
the
fire
.
Ada
sat
at
the
piano
;
Richard
stood
beside
her
,
bending
*NL*
down
.
Upon
the
wall
,
their
shadows
blended
together
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
strange
forms
,
not
without
a
ghostly
motion
caught
from
the
unsteady
*NL*
fire
,
though
reflecting
from
motionless
objects
.
Ada
touched
the
*NL*
notes
so
softly
and
sang
so
low
that
the
wind
,
sighing
away
to
the
*NL*
distant
hills
,
was
as
audible
as
the
music
.
The
mystery
of
the
future
*NL*
and
the
little
clue
afforded
to
it
by
the
voice
of
the
present
seemed
*NL*
expressed
in
the
whole
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
not
to
recall
this
fancy
,
well
as
I
remember
it
,
that
I
*NL*
recall
the
scene
.
First
,
I
was
not
quite
unconscious
of
the
contrast
*NL*
in
respect
of
meaning
and
intention
between
the
silent
look
directed
*NL*
that
way
and
the
flow
of
words
that
had
preceded
it
.
Secondly
,
though
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
's
glance
as
he
withdrew
it
rested
for
but
a
moment
on
*NL*
me
,
I
felt
as
if
in
that
moment
he
confided
to
me
--
and
knew
that
he
*NL*
confided
to
me
and
that
I
received
the
confidence
--
his
hope
that
Ada
*NL*
and
Richard
might
one
day
enter
on
a
dearer
relationship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
could
play
on
the
piano
and
the
violoncello
,
and
he
was
*NL*
a
composer
--
had
composed
half
an
opera
once
,
but
got
tired
of
it
--
and
*NL*
played
what
he
composed
with
taste
.
After
tea
we
had
quite
a
little
*NL*
concert
,
in
which
Richard
--
who
was
enthralled
by
Ada
's
singing
and
*NL*
told
me
that
she
seemed
to
know
all
the
songs
that
ever
were
*NL*
written
--
and
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
and
I
were
the
audience
.
After
a
little
*NL*
while
I
missed
first
Mr.
Skimpole
and
afterwards
Richard
,
and
while
I
*NL*
was
thinking
how
could
Richard
stay
away
so
long
and
lose
so
much
,
*NL*
the
maid
who
had
given
me
the
keys
looked
in
at
the
door
,
saying
,
``
If
*NL*
you
please
,
miss
,
could
you
spare
a
minute
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
shut
out
with
her
in
the
hall
,
she
said
,
holding
up
her
*NL*
hands

``
Oh

*NL*

I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Took

Sudden

said
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
apprehensive
that
his
illness
might
be
of
a
dangerous
kind
,
but
*NL*
of
course
I
begged
her
to
be
quiet
and
not
disturb
any
one
and
*NL*
collected
myself
,
as
I
followed
her
quickly
upstairs
,
sufficiently
to
*NL*
consider
what
were
the
best
remedies
to
be
applied
if
it
should
prove
*NL*
to
be
a
fit
.
She
threw
open
a
door
and
I
went
into
a
chamber
,
where
,
*NL*
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
,
instead
of
finding
Mr.
Skimpole
stretched
*NL*
upon
the
bed
or
prostrate
on
the
floor
,
I
found
him
standing
before
*NL*
the
fire
smiling
at
Richard
,
while
Richard
,
with
a
face
of
great
*NL*
embarrassment
,
looked
at
a
person
on
the
sofa
,
in
a
white
great-coat
,
*NL*
with
smooth
hair
upon
his
head
and
not
much
of
it
,
which
he
was
*NL*
wiping
smoother
and
making
less
of
with
a
pocket-handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Richard
hurriedly
,
``
I
am
glad
you
are
come

*NL*
You

be
able
to
advise

Our

is
arrested
for
debt

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
really
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson

said
Mr.
Skimpole
with
his
*NL*
agreeable
candour
,
``
I
never
was
in
a
situation
in
which
that
*NL*
excellent
sense

quiet
habit
of
method
and
usefulness

which
*NL*
anybody
must
observe
in
you
who
has
the
happiness
of
being
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
in
your
society

was
more
needed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
on
the
sofa
,
who
appeared
to
have
a
cold
in
his
head
,
gave
*NL*
such
a
very
loud
snort
that
he
startled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
arrested
for
much
,
sir
?
''
I
inquired
of
Mr.
Skimpole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
he
,
shaking
his
head
pleasantly
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know

Some
pounds
,
odd
shillings
,
and
halfpence

I

mentioned

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
twenty-four

sixteen

observed
*NL*
the
stranger
.
``
That
's
wot
it
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
sounds
--
somehow
it
sounds
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
like
a
small
*NL*
sum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
man
said
nothing
but
made
another
snort
.
It
was
such
a
*NL*
powerful
one
that
it
seemed
quite
to
lift
him
out
of
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Skimpole
,
''
said
Richard
to
me
,
``
has
a
delicacy
in
applying
to
my

I
understood
you

that

had
lately

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

returned
Mr.
Skimpole
,
smiling
.
``
Though
I
forgot
how
much
*NL*
it
was

when
it
was

Jarndyce
would
readily
do

I
*NL*
have
the
epicure-like
feeling
that
I
would
prefer
a
novelty
in
help
,
*NL*
that
I
would
rather

''
and
he
looked
at
Richard
and
me
,
``
develop
*NL*
generosity
in
a
new
soil
and
in
a
new
form

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

be
best

Miss

''
said
Richard
,
*NL*
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ventured
to
inquire
,
generally
,
before
replying
,
what
would
happen
*NL*
if
the
money
were
not
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jail
,
''
said
the
strange
man
,
coolly
putting
his
handkerchief
into
*NL*
his
hat
,
which
was
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
.
``
Or
Coavinses

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
,
sir
,
what
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coavinses

''
said
the
strange
man
.
``
A
`
ouse

''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
and
I
looked
at
one
another
again
.
It
was
a
most
singular
*NL*
thing
that
the
arrest
was
our
embarrassment
and
not
Mr.
Skimpole
's
.
*NL*
He
observed
us
with
a
genial
interest
,
but
there
seemed
,
if
I
may
*NL*
venture
on
such
a
contradiction
,
nothing
selfish
in
it
.
He
had
*NL*
entirely
washed
his
hands
of
the
difficulty
,
and
it
had
become
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
he
suggested
,
as
if
good-naturedly
to
help
us
out
,
``
that
*NL*
being
parties
in

property
,
Mr.
Richard

his
beautiful

both
,
*NL*

sign
something

make
over
something
,
or
give
some
sort
of

undertaking
,
or
pledge
,
or
bond
?
I
do
n't
know
what
the
business
name
*NL*
of
it
may
be
,
but
I
suppose
there
is
some
instrument
within
their
*NL*
power
that
would
settle
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
on
it
,
''
said
the
strange
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
That
seems
odd
,
now
,
to
one
who
is
*NL*
no
judge
of
these
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odd
or
even
,

said
the
stranger
gruffly
,
``
I
tell
you
,
not
a
bit
on
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
your
temper
,
my
good
fellow
,
keep
your
temper
!
''
Mr.
Skimpole
*NL*
gently
reasoned
with
him
as
he
made
a
little
drawing
of
his
head
on
*NL*
the
fly-leaf
of
a
book
.
``
Do
n't
be
ruffled
by
your
occupation
.
We
can
*NL*
separate
you
from
your
office
;
we
can
separate
the
individual
from
*NL*
the
pursuit
.
We
are
not
so
prejudiced
as
to
suppose
that
in
private
*NL*
life
you
are
otherwise
than
a
very
estimable
man
,
with
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
poetry
in
your
nature
,
of
which
you
may
not
be
conscious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
only
answered
with
another
violent
snort
,
whether
in
*NL*
acceptance
of
the
poetry-tribute
or
in
disdainful
rejection
of
it
,
he
*NL*
did
not
express
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
and
my
dear
Mr.
Richard
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
gaily
,
innocently
,
and
confidingly
as
he
looked
at
his
*NL*
drawing
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
``
here
you
see
me
utterly
incapable
*NL*
of
helping
myself

and
entirely
in

I
only
ask
to
be
free
.
*NL*
The
butterflies
are
free

Mankind
will
surely
not
deny
to
Harold
*NL*
Skimpole
what
it
concedes
to
the
butterflies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Richard
in
a
whisper
,
``
I
have
ten
*NL*
pounds
that
I
received
from
Mr.
Kenge
.
I
must
try
what
that
will
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
possessed
fifteen
pounds
,
odd
shillings
,
which
I
had
saved
from
my
*NL*
quarterly
allowance
during
several
years
.
I
had
always
thought
that
*NL*
some
accident
might
happen
which
would
throw
me
suddenly
,
without
any
*NL*
relation
or
any
property
,
on
the
world
and
had
always
tried
to
keep
*NL*
some
little
money
by
me
that
I
might
not
be
quite
penniless
.
I
told
*NL*
Richard
of
my
having
this
little
store
and
having
no
present
need
of
*NL*
it
,
and
I
asked
him
delicately
to
inform
Mr.
Skimpole
,
while
I
should
*NL*
be
gone
to
fetch
it
,
that
we
would
have
the
pleasure
of
paying
his
*NL*
debt
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
back
,
Mr.
Skimpole
kissed
my
hand
and
seemed
quite
*NL*
touched
.
Not
on
his
own
account
-LRB-
I
was
again
aware
of
that
perplexing
*NL*
and
extraordinary
contradiction
-RRB-
,
but
on
ours
,
as
if
personal
*NL*
considerations
were
impossible
with
him
and
the
contemplation
of
our
*NL*
happiness
alone
affected
him
.
Richard
,
begging
me
,
for
the
greater
*NL*
grace
of
the
transaction
,
as
he
said
,
to
settle
with
Coavinses
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
now
jocularly
called
him
-RRB-
,
I
counted
out
the
money
and
*NL*
received
the
necessary
acknowledgment
.
This
,
too
,
delighted
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
compliments
were
so
delicately
administered
that
I
blushed
less
*NL*
than
I
might
have
done
and
settled
with
the
stranger
in
the
white
*NL*
coat
without
making
any
mistakes
.
He
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
*NL*
shortly
said
,
``
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
wish
you
a
good
evening

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
*NL*
after
giving
up
the
sketch
when
it
was
half
finished
,
``
I
should
like
*NL*
to
ask
you
something
,
without
offence

*NL*
*NL*
I
think
the
reply
was
,
``
Cut
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
this
morning

now

*NL*
*NL*

Coavinses

Not

Coavinses

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
you
came
down
here

proceeded
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
it
was
a

Mr.

growled
Coavinses
with
an
appearance
of
strong

resentment

``

with
profound
contempt
-RRB-

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
did

proceeded
Mr.

this

does
it
seem

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
certainly

did

NOT

said
Coavinses
,
whose
doggedness
in
utterly
*NL*
renouncing
the
idea
was
of
that
intense
kind
that
he
could
only
give
*NL*
adequate
expression
to
it
by
putting
a
long
interval
between
each
*NL*
word

and
accompanying
the
last
with
a
jerk
that
might
have
*NL*
dislocated
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
odd
and
very
curious

mental
process

Mr.

thoughtfully

``
Thank

Good

*NL*
*NL*
As
our
absence
had
been
long
enough
already
to
seem
strange
*NL*
downstairs
,
I
returned
at
once
and
found
Ada
sitting
at
work
by
the
*NL*
fireside
talking
to
her
cousin
John
.
Mr.
Skimpole
presently
appeared
,
*NL*
and
Richard
shortly
after
him
.
I
was
sufficiently
engaged
during
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
evening
in
taking
my
first
lesson
in
backgammon
from
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
who
was
very
fond
of
the
game
and
from
whom
I
wished
of
*NL*
course
to
learn
it
as
quickly
as
I
could
in
order
that
I
might
be
of
*NL*
the
very
small
use
of
being
able
to
play
when
he
had
no
better
*NL*
adversary
.
But
I
thought
,
occasionally
,
when
Mr.
Skimpole
played
some
*NL*
fragments
of
his
own
compositions
or
when
,
both
at
the
piano
and
the
*NL*
violoncello
,
and
at
our
table
,
he
preserved
with
an
absence
of
all
*NL*
effort
his
delightful
spirits
and
his
easy
flow
of
conversation
,
that
*NL*
Richard
and
I
seemed
to
retain
the
transferred
impression
of
having
*NL*
been
arrested
since
dinner
and
that
it
was
very
curious
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
before
we
separated
,
for
when
Ada
was
going
at
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
,
Mr.
Skimpole
went
to
the
piano
and
rattled
hilariously
that
*NL*
the
best
of
all
ways
to
lengthen
our
days
was
to
steal
a
few
hours
*NL*
from
night
,
my
dear
!
It
was
past
twelve
before
he
took
his
candle
and
*NL*
his
radiant
face
out
of
the
room
,
and
I
think
he
might
have
kept
us
*NL*
there
,
if
he
had
seen
fit
,
until
daybreak
.
Ada
and
Richard
were
*NL*
lingering
for
a
few
moments
by
the
fire
,
wondering
whether
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
had
yet
finished
her
dictation
for
the
day
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
who
had
been
out
of
the
room
,
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
what
's
this
,
what
's
this
!
''
he
said
,
rubbing
his
head
*NL*
and
walking
about
with
his
good-humoured
vexation
.
``
What
's
this
they
*NL*
tell
me
?

Why

How

you
do

How
much

was
it

The

wind
's
round
again

I
feel
it
all
over

We
neither

quite
knew
what
to
answer

,
come
!
I
must
settle
this
before
I
sleep
.
How
much
are
*NL*
you
out
of
pocket
?
You
two
made
the
money
up
,
you
know
!
Why
did
you
?
*NL*
How
could
you
?
Oh
,
Lord
,
yes
,
it
's
due
east
--
must
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
sir
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
honourable
in
*NL*
me
to
tell
you
.
Mr.
Skimpole
relied
upon
us
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
you
,
my
dear
boy
!
He
relies
upon
everybody
!
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
giving
his
head
a
great
rub
and
stopping
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
!
And
he
'll
be
in
the
same
scrape
again
next
week
!
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
walking
again
at
a
great
pace
,
with
a
candle
in
his
*NL*
hand
that
had
gone
out
.
``
He
's
always
in
the
same
scrape
.
He
was
born
*NL*
in
the
same
scrape
.
I
verily
believe
that
the
announcement
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
when
his
mother
was
confined
was
`
On
Tuesday
last
,
at
her
*NL*
residence
in
Botheration
Buildings
,
Mrs.
Skimpole
of
a
son
in
*NL*
difficulties
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
laughed
heartily
but
added
,
``
Still
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
shake
his
confidence
or
to
break
his
confidence
,
and
if
I
submit
to
*NL*
your
better
knowledge
again
,
that
I
ought
to
keep
his
secret
,
I
hope
*NL*
you
will
consider
before
you
press
me
any
more
.
Of
course
,
if
you
do
*NL*
press
me
,
sir
,
I
shall
know
I
am
wrong
and
will
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
stopping
again
,
and
making
several
absent
*NL*
endeavours
to
put
his
candlestick
in
his
pocket
.
``
I
--
here
!
Take
it
*NL*
away
,
my
dear
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
about
with
it
;
it
's
all
the
*NL*
wind
--
invariably
has
that
effect
--
I
wo
n't
press
you
,
Rick
;
you
may
be
*NL*
right
.
But
really
--
to
get
hold
of
you
and
Esther
--
and
to
squeeze
you
*NL*
like
a
couple
of
tender
young
Saint
Michael
's
oranges
!
It
'll
blow
a
*NL*
gale
in
the
course
of
the
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
now
alternately
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
as
if
he
*NL*
were
going
to
keep
them
there
a
long
time
,
and
taking
them
out
again
*NL*
and
vehemently
rubbing
them
all
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ventured
to
take
this
opportunity
of
hinting
that
Mr.
Skimpole
,
*NL*
being
in
all
such
matters
quite
a
child
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
catching
at
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
quite
a
child
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
so
different
from
other
*NL*
people
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
!
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
brightening
.
``
Your
woman
's
wit
*NL*
hits
the
mark
.
He
is
a
child
--
an
absolute
child
.
I
told
you
he
was
a
*NL*
child
,
you
know
,
when
I
first
mentioned
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
!
Certainly
!
we
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
IS
a
child
.
Now
,
is
n't
he
?
''
asked
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
brightening
*NL*
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
indeed
,
we
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
come
to
think
of
it
,
it
's
the
height
of
childishness
in
*NL*
you
--
I
mean
me
--
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
to
regard
him
for
a
moment
as
a
*NL*
man
.
You
ca
n't
make
HIM
responsible
.
The
idea
of
Harold
Skimpole
with
*NL*
designs

plans
,
or
knowledge
of
consequences
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
delicious
to
see
the
clouds
about
his
bright
face
clearing
,
*NL*
and
to
see
him
so
heartily
pleased
,
and
to
know
,
as
it
was
impossible
*NL*
not
to
know
,
that
the
source
of
his
pleasure
was
the
goodness
which
*NL*
was
tortured
by
condemning
,
or
mistrusting
,
or
secretly
accusing
any
*NL*
one
,
that
I
saw
the
tears
in
Ada
's
eyes
,
while
she
echoed
his
laugh
,
*NL*
and
felt
them
in
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
cod
's
head
and
shoulders
I
am
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
to
*NL*
require
reminding
of
it
!
The
whole
business
shows
the
child
from
*NL*
beginning
to
end

Nobody
but
a
child
would
have
thought
of
singling
*NL*
YOU
two
out
for

Nobody

YOUR

the
money
!
If
it
had
been
a
thousand
pounds

*NL*
it
would
have
been
just
the

''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
with
his
whole
*NL*
face
in
a
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
confirmed
it
from
our
night
's
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure

''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
However
,
Rick

I
do
n't

your
little

safe
from

I
must
have
a
promise
all
round
that
*NL*
nothing
of
this
sort
shall
ever
be
done
any
more
.
No
advances
!
Not
*NL*
even
sixpences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
promised
faithfully
,
Richard
with
a
merry
glance
at
me
*NL*
touching
his
pocket
as
if
to
remind
me
that
there
was
no
danger
of
*NL*
OUR
transgressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
Skimpole
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
a
habitable
doll
's
house
with
*NL*
good
board
and
a
few
tin
people
to
get
into
debt
with
and
borrow
*NL*
money
of
would
set
the
boy
up
in
life
.
He
is
in
a
child
's
sleep
by
*NL*
this
time
,
I
suppose
;
it
's
time
I
should
take
my
craftier
head
to
my
*NL*
more
worldly
pillow
.
Good
night
,
my
dears
.
God
bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
peeped
in
again
,
with
a
smiling
face
,
before
we
had
lighted
our
*NL*
candles
,
and
said
,
``
Oh
!
I
have
been
looking
at
the
weather-cock
.
I
*NL*
find
it
was
a
false
alarm
about
the
wind
.
It
's
in
the
south
!
''
And
*NL*
went
away
singing
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
and
I
agreed
,
as
we
talked
together
for
a
little
while
upstairs
,
*NL*
that
this
caprice
about
the
wind
was
a
fiction
and
that
he
used
the
*NL*
pretence
to
account
for
any
disappointment
he
could
not
conceal
,
*NL*
rather
than
he
would
blame
the
real
cause
of
it
or
disparage
or
*NL*
depreciate
any
one
.
We
thought
this
very
characteristic
of
his
*NL*
eccentric
gentleness
and
of
the
difference
between
him
and
those
*NL*
petulant
people
who
make
the
weather
and
the
winds
-LRB-
particularly
that
*NL*
unlucky
wind
which
he
had
chosen
for
such
a
different
purpose
-RRB-
the
*NL*
stalking-horses
of
their
splenetic
and
gloomy
humours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
so
much
affection
for
him
had
been
added
in
this
one
evening
*NL*
to
my
gratitude
that
I
hoped
I
already
began
to
understand
him
*NL*
through
that
mingled
feeling
.
Any
seeming
inconsistencies
in
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
or
in
Mrs.
Jellyby
I
could
not
expect
to
be
able
to
*NL*
reconcile
,
having
so
little
experience
or
practical
knowledge
.
*NL*
Neither
did
I
try
,
for
my
thoughts
were
busy
when
I
was
alone
,
with
*NL*
Ada
and
Richard
and
with
the
confidence
I
had
seemed
to
receive
*NL*
concerning
them
.
My
fancy
,
made
a
little
wild
by
the
wind
perhaps
,
*NL*
would
not
consent
to
be
all
unselfish
,
either
,
though
I
would
have
*NL*
persuaded
it
to
be
so
if
I
could
.
It
wandered
back
to
my
godmother
's
*NL*
house
and
came
along
the
intervening
track
,
raising
up
shadowy
*NL*
speculations
which
had
sometimes
trembled
there
in
the
dark
as
to
*NL*
what
knowledge
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
of
my
earliest
history
--
even
as
to
*NL*
the
possibility
of
his
being
my
father
,
though
that
idle
dream
was
*NL*
quite
gone
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
gone
now
,
I
remembered
,
getting
up
from
the
fire
.
It
was
*NL*
not
for
me
to
muse
over
bygones
,
but
to
act
with
a
cheerful
spirit
*NL*
and
a
grateful
heart
.
So
I
said
to
myself
,
``
Esther
,
Esther
,
Esther
!
*NL*
Duty
,
my
dear
!
''
and
gave
my
little
basket
of
housekeeping
keys
such
a
*NL*
shake
that
they
sounded
like
little
bells
and
rang
me
hopefully
to
*NL*
bed
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
's
Walk
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Esther
sleeps
,
and
while
Esther
wakes
,
it
is
still
wet
weather
*NL*
down
at
the
place
in
Lincolnshire
.
The
rain
is
ever
falling
--
drip
,
*NL*
drip
,
drip
--
by
day
and
night
upon
the
broad
flagged
terrace-pavement
,
*NL*
the
Ghost
's
Walk
.
The
weather
is
so
very
bad
down
in
Lincolnshire
*NL*
that
the
liveliest
imagination
can
scarcely
apprehend
its
ever
being
*NL*
fine
again
.
Not
that
there
is
any
superabundant
life
of
imagination
*NL*
on
the
spot
,
for
Sir
Leicester
is
not
here
-LRB-
and
,
truly
,
even
if
he
*NL*
were
,
would
not
do
much
for
it
in
that
particular
-RRB-
,
but
is
in
Paris
*NL*
with
my
Lady
;
and
solitude
,
with
dusky
wings
,
sits
brooding
upon
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
may
be
some
motions
of
fancy
among
the
lower
animals
at
Chesney
*NL*
Wold
.
The
horses
in
the
stables
--
the
long
stables
in
a
barren
,
*NL*
red-brick
court-yard
,
where
there
is
a
great
bell
in
a
turret
,
and
a
*NL*
clock
with
a
large
face
,
which
the
pigeons
who
live
near
it
and
who
*NL*
love
to
perch
upon
its
shoulders
seem
to
be
always
consulting
--
THEY
*NL*
may
contemplate
some
mental
pictures
of
fine
weather
on
occasions
,
*NL*
and
may
be
better
artists
at
them
than
the
grooms
.
The
old
roan
,
so
*NL*
famous
for
cross-country
work
,
turning
his
large
eyeball
to
the
*NL*
grated
window
near
his
rack
,
may
remember
the
fresh
leaves
that
*NL*
glisten
there
at
other
times
and
the
scents
that
stream
in
,
and
may
*NL*
have
a
fine
run
with
the
hounds
,
while
the
human
helper
,
clearing
out
*NL*
the
next
stall
,
never
stirs
beyond
his
pitchfork
and
birch-broom
.
The
*NL*
grey
,
whose
place
is
opposite
the
door
and
who
with
an
impatient
*NL*
rattle
of
his
halter
pricks
his
ears
and
turns
his
head
so
wistfully
*NL*
when
it
is
opened
,
and
to
whom
the
opener
says
,
``
Woa
grey
,
then
,
*NL*
steady
!
Noabody
wants
you
to-day
!
''
may
know
it
quite
as
well
as
the
*NL*
man
.
The
whole
seemingly
monotonous
and
uncompanionable
half-dozen
,
*NL*
stabled
together
,
may
pass
the
long
wet
hours
when
the
door
is
shut
*NL*
in
livelier
communication
than
is
held
in
the
servants
'
hall
or
at
*NL*
the
Dedlock
Arms
,
or
may
even
beguile
the
time
by
improving
-LRB-
perhaps
*NL*
corrupting
-RRB-
the
pony
in
the
loose-box
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
mastiff
,
dozing
in
his
kennel
in
the
court-yard
with
his
large
*NL*
head
on
his
paws
,
may
think
of
the
hot
sunshine
when
the
shadows
of
*NL*
the
stable-buildings
tire
his
patience
out
by
changing
and
leave
him
*NL*
at
one
time
of
the
day
no
broader
refuge
than
the
shadow
of
his
own
*NL*
house
,
where
he
sits
on
end
,
panting
and
growling
short
,
and
very
*NL*
much
wanting
something
to
worry
besides
himself
and
his
chain
.
So
*NL*
now
,
half-waking
and
all-winking
,
he
may
recall
the
house
full
of
*NL*
company
,
the
coach-houses
full
of
vehicles
,
the
stables
full
of
*NL*
horses
,
and
the
out-buildings
full
of
attendants
upon
horses
,
until
*NL*
he
is
undecided
about
the
present
and
comes
forth
to
see
how
it
is
.
*NL*
Then
,
with
that
impatient
shake
of
himself
,
he
may
growl
in
the
*NL*
spirit
,
``
Rain
,
rain
,
rain
!
Nothing
but
rain
--
and
no
family
here
!
''
as
*NL*
he
goes
in
again
and
lies
down
with
a
gloomy
yawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
with
the
dogs
in
the
kennel-buildings
across
the
park
,
who
have
*NL*
their
restless
fits
and
whose
doleful
voices
when
the
wind
has
been
*NL*
very
obstinate
have
even
made
it
known
in
the
house
itself
--
upstairs
,
*NL*
downstairs
,
and
in
my
Lady
's
chamber
.
They
may
hunt
the
whole
*NL*
country-side
,
while
the
raindrops
are
pattering
round
their
*NL*
inactivity
.
So
the
rabbits
with
their
self-betraying
tails
,
frisking
*NL*
in
and
out
of
holes
at
roots
of
trees
,
may
be
lively
with
ideas
of
*NL*
the
breezy
days
when
their
ears
are
blown
about
or
of
those
seasons
*NL*
of
interest
when
there
are
sweet
young
plants
to
gnaw
.
The
turkey
in
*NL*
the
poultry-yard
,
always
troubled
with
a
class-grievance
-LRB-
probably
*NL*
Christmas
-RRB-
,
may
be
reminiscent
of
that
summer
morning
wrongfully
*NL*
taken
from
him
when
he
got
into
the
lane
among
the
felled
trees
,
*NL*
where
there
was
a
barn
and
barley
.
The
discontented
goose
,
who
stoops
*NL*
to
pass
under
the
old
gateway
,
twenty
feet
high
,
may
gabble
out
,
if
*NL*
we
only
knew
it
,
a
waddling
preference
for
weather
when
the
gateway
*NL*
casts
its
shadow
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
this
as
it
may
,
there
is
not
much
fancy
otherwise
stirring
at
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
.
If
there
be
a
little
at
any
odd
moment
,
it
goes
,
like
a
*NL*
little
noise
in
that
old
echoing
place
,
a
long
way
and
usually
leads
*NL*
off
to
ghosts
and
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
rained
so
hard
and
rained
so
long
down
in
Lincolnshire
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
the
old
housekeeper
at
Chesney
Wold
,
has
several
*NL*
times
taken
off
her
spectacles
and
cleaned
them
to
make
certain
that
*NL*
the
drops
were
not
upon
the
glasses
.
Mrs.
Rouncewell
might
have
been
*NL*
sufficiently
assured
by
hearing
the
rain
,
but
that
she
is
rather
*NL*
deaf
,
which
nothing
will
induce
her
to
believe
.
She
is
a
fine
old
*NL*
lady
,
handsome
,
stately
,
wonderfully
neat
,
and
has
such
a
back
and
*NL*
such
a
stomacher
that
if
her
stays
should
turn
out
when
she
dies
to
*NL*
have
been
a
broad
old-fashioned
family
fire-grate
,
nobody
who
knows
*NL*
her
would
have
cause
to
be
surprised
.
Weather
affects
Mrs.
Rouncewell
*NL*
little
.
The
house
is
there
in
all
weathers
,
and
the
house
,
as
she
*NL*
expresses
it
,
``
is
what
she
looks
at
.
''
She
sits
in
her
room
-LRB-
in
a
side
*NL*
passage
on
the
ground
floor
,
with
an
arched
window
commanding
a
*NL*
smooth
quadrangle
,
adorned
at
regular
intervals
with
smooth
round
*NL*
trees
and
smooth
round
blocks
of
stone
,
as
if
the
trees
were
going
to
*NL*
play
at
bowls
with
the
stones
-RRB-
,
and
the
whole
house
reposes
on
her
*NL*
mind
.
She
can
open
it
on
occasion
and
be
busy
and
fluttered
,
but
it
*NL*
is
shut
up
now
and
lies
on
the
breadth
of
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
*NL*
iron-bound
bosom
in
a
majestic
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
next
difficult
thing
to
an
impossibility
to
imagine
Chesney
*NL*
Wold
without
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
but
she
has
only
been
here
fifty
years
.
*NL*
Ask
her
how
long
,
this
rainy
day
,
and
she
shall
answer
``
fifty
year
,
*NL*
three
months
,
and
a
fortnight
,
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
,
if
I
live
*NL*
till
Tuesday
.
''
Mr.
Rouncewell
died
some
time
before
the
decease
of
*NL*
the
pretty
fashion
of
pig-tails
,
and
modestly
hid
his
own
-LRB-
if
he
took
*NL*
it
with
him
-RRB-
in
a
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
the
park
near
the
*NL*
mouldy
porch
.
He
was
born
in
the
market-town
,
and
so
was
his
young
*NL*
widow
.
Her
progress
in
the
family
began
in
the
time
of
the
last
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
and
originated
in
the
still-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
representative
of
the
Dedlocks
is
an
excellent
master
.
He
*NL*
supposes
all
his
dependents
to
be
utterly
bereft
of
individual
*NL*
characters
,
intentions
,
or
opinions
,
and
is
persuaded
that
he
was
*NL*
born
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
their
having
any
.
If
he
were
to
*NL*
make
a
discovery
to
the
contrary
,
he
would
be
simply
stunned
--
would
*NL*
never
recover
himself
,
most
likely
,
except
to
gasp
and
die
.
But
he
is
*NL*
an
excellent
master
still
,
holding
it
a
part
of
his
state
to
be
so
.
*NL*
He
has
a
great
liking
for
Mrs.
Rouncewell
;
he
says
she
is
a
most
*NL*
respectable
,
creditable
woman
.
He
always
shakes
hands
with
her
when
*NL*
he
comes
down
to
Chesney
Wold
and
when
he
goes
away
;
and
if
he
were
*NL*
very
ill
,
or
if
he
were
knocked
down
by
accident
,
or
run
over
,
or
*NL*
placed
in
any
situation
expressive
of
a
Dedlock
at
a
disadvantage
,
he
*NL*
would
say
if
he
could
speak
,
``
Leave
me
,
and
send
Mrs.
Rouncewell
*NL*
here
!
''
feeling
his
dignity
,
at
such
a
pass
,
safer
with
her
than
with
*NL*
anybody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
has
known
trouble
.
She
has
had
two
sons
,
of
whom
the
*NL*
younger
ran
wild
,
and
went
for
a
soldier
,
and
never
came
back
.
Even
*NL*
to
this
hour
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
calm
hands
lose
their
composure
when
*NL*
she
speaks
of
him
,
and
unfolding
themselves
from
her
stomacher
,
hover
*NL*
about
her
in
an
agitated
manner
as
she
says
what
a
likely
lad
,
what
a
*NL*
fine
lad
,
what
a
gay
,
good-humoured
,
clever
lad
he
was
!
Her
second
*NL*
son
would
have
been
provided
for
at
Chesney
Wold
and
would
have
been
*NL*
made
steward
in
due
season
,
but
he
took
,
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
,
to
*NL*
constructing
steam-engines
out
of
saucepans
and
setting
birds
to
draw
*NL*
their
own
water
with
the
least
possible
amount
of
labour
,
so
*NL*
assisting
them
with
artful
contrivance
of
hydraulic
pressure
that
a
*NL*
thirsty
canary
had
only
,
in
a
literal
sense
,
to
put
his
shoulder
to
*NL*
the
wheel
and
the
job
was
done
.
This
propensity
gave
Mrs.
Rouncewell
*NL*
great
uneasiness
.
She
felt
it
with
a
mother
's
anguish
to
be
a
move
in
*NL*
the
Wat
Tyler
direction
,
well
knowing
that
Sir
Leicester
had
that
*NL*
general
impression
of
an
aptitude
for
any
art
to
which
smoke
and
a
*NL*
tall
chimney
might
be
considered
essential
.
But
the
doomed
young
*NL*
rebel
-LRB-
otherwise
a
mild
youth
,
and
very
persevering
-RRB-
,
showing
no
sign
*NL*
of
grace
as
he
got
older
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
constructing
a
model
*NL*
of
a
power-loom
,
she
was
fain
,
with
many
tears
,
to
mention
his
*NL*
backslidings
to
the
baronet
.
``
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
''
said
Sir
Leicester
,
*NL*
``
I
can
never
consent
to
argue
,
as
you
know
,
with
any
one
on
any
*NL*
subject
.
You
had
better
get
rid
of
your
boy
;
you
had
better
get
him
*NL*
into
some
Works
.
The
iron
country
farther
north
is
,
I
suppose
,
the
*NL*
congenial
direction
for
a
boy
with
these
tendencies
.
''
Farther
north
*NL*
he
went
,
and
farther
north
he
grew
up
;
and
if
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
*NL*
ever
saw
him
when
he
came
to
Chesney
Wold
to
visit
his
mother
,
or
*NL*
ever
thought
of
him
afterwards
,
it
is
certain
that
he
only
regarded
*NL*
him
as
one
of
a
body
of
some
odd
thousand
conspirators
,
swarthy
and
*NL*
grim
,
who
were
in
the
habit
of
turning
out
by
torchlight
two
or
three
*NL*
nights
in
the
week
for
unlawful
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
son
has
,
in
the
course
of
nature
and
*NL*
art
,
grown
up
,
and
established
himself
,
and
married
,
and
called
unto
*NL*
him
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
grandson
,
who
,
being
out
of
his
apprenticeship
,
*NL*
and
home
from
a
journey
in
far
countries
,
whither
he
was
sent
to
*NL*
enlarge
his
knowledge
and
complete
his
preparations
for
the
venture
*NL*
of
this
life
,
stands
leaning
against
the
chimney-piece
this
very
day
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
room
at
Chesney
Wold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

says
Mrs.
Rouncewell
.
``
You

young

Mrs.
*NL*
Rouncewell
's
hands
unquiet
,
as
usual
,
on
this
reference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They

Mrs.
Rouncewell
folds
her
hands
again
.

*NL*
``
Thriving

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thankful

''
Mrs.
Rouncewell
is
fond
of
her
son
but
has
a
*NL*
plaintive
feeling
towards
him
,
much
as
if
he
were
a
very
honourable
*NL*
soldier
who
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Grandmother

says
the
young
man
,
changing
the
subject
,

expanding
her
stomacher
to
its

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
inclines
his
head
in
acknowledgment
of
the
precepts
of
*NL*
experience
.
Mrs.
Rouncewell
listens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheels
!

says
she
.
They
have
long
been
audible
to
the

*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
interval

a
tap
at

door
.
``
Come

A
dark-eyed

dark-haired
,
shy

village
beauty
comes
in

so
fresh
in

rosy
and

delicate

the

in
quick

to

dissent
from
the

Now

Mr.

is

relaxes

*NL*
*NL*
The
old
housekeeper

with
a
gracious
severity

waves

her

towards
the
great
staircase

Mr.
Guppy
and
his
friend
follow
*NL*
Rosa
;
Mrs.
Rouncewell

her
grandson
follow
them
;
a
young
gardener
*NL*
goes
before
to
open
the
shutters
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
is
usually
the
case
with
people
who
go
over
houses
,
Mr.
Guppy
and
*NL*
his
friend
are
dead
beat
before
they
have
well
begun
.
They
straggle
*NL*
about
in
wrong
places
,
look
at
wrong
things
,
do
n't
care
for
the
right
*NL*
things
,
gape
when
more
rooms
are
opened
,
exhibit
profound
depression
*NL*
of
spirits
,

are
clearly
knocked
up
.
In
each
successive
chamber
*NL*
that
they
enter
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
who
is
as
upright
as
the
house
*NL*
itself
,
rests
apart
in
a
window-seat
or
other
such
nook
and
listens
*NL*
with
stately
approval
to
Rosa
's
exposition
.
Her
grandson
is
so
*NL*
attentive
to
it
that
Rosa
is
shyer
than
ever
--
and
prettier

Thus
they
*NL*
pass
on
from
room
to
room
,
raising
the
pictured
Dedlocks
for
a
few
*NL*
brief
minutes
as
the
young
gardener
admits
the
light
,

*NL*
reconsigning
them
to
their
graves
as
he
shuts
it
out
again

It

appears
to
the
afflicted
Mr.

and
his
inconsolable
friend
that
*NL*
there
is
no
end
to
the
Dedlocks
,
whose
family
greatness
seems
to
*NL*
consist
in
their
never
having
done
anything
to
distinguish
themselves
*NL*
for
seven
hundred
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
long
drawing-room
of
Chesney
Wold
can
not
revive
Mr.
Guppy
's
*NL*
spirits
.
He
is
so
low
that
he
droops
on
the
threshold
and
has
hardly
*NL*
strength
of
mind
to
enter
.
But
a
portrait
over
the
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
painted
by
the
fashionable
artist
of
the
day
,
acts
upon
him
like
a
*NL*
charm
.
He
recovers
in
a
moment
.
He
stares
at
it
with
uncommon
*NL*
interest
;
he
seems
to
be
fixed
and
fascinated
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
picture
over
the
fire-place
,

says
Rosa
,
``
is
the
portrait
of
the
*NL*

Lady
Dedlock

is
considered
a

best
work
of
the
master

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blest

''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
staring
in
a
kind
of
dismay
at
his
friend
,
*NL*
``
if
I
can
ever
have
seen
her

Yet
I
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

says
Mr.

in
a
low
voice
.

'll
be

Lady
Dedlock

is
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
picture
on
the
right
is
the
present
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

The
*NL*
picture

father
,
the
late
Sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
has
no
eyes
for
either
of
these
magnates
.
``
It
's
*NL*
unaccountable
to
me

he
says
,
still
staring
at
the
portrait
,
``
how
*NL*
well
I
know
that
picture

I
'm
dashed

''
adds
Mr.
Guppy
,
looking
round
,
*NL*
``
if
I
do
n't

I
must
have
had
a
dream
of

*NL*
*NL*
As
no
one
present
takes
any
especial
interest
in
Mr.
Guppy
's
dreams
,
*NL*
the
probability
is
not
pursued
.
But
he
still
remains
so
absorbed
by
*NL*
the
portrait
that
he
stands
immovable
before
it
until
the
young
*NL*
gardener
has
closed
the
shutters
,
when
he
comes
out
of
the
room
in
a
*NL*
dazed
state
that
is
an
odd
though
a
sufficient
substitute
for
*NL*
interest
and
follows
into
the
succeeding
rooms
with
a
confused
stare
,
*NL*
as
if
he
were
looking
everywhere
for
Lady
Dedlock
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sees
no
more
of
her
.
He
sees
her
rooms
,
which
are
the
last
shown
,
*NL*
as
being
very
elegant
,
and
he
looks
out
of
the
windows
from
which
she
*NL*
looked
out
,
not
long
ago
,
upon
the
weather
that
bored
her
to
death
.
*NL*
All
things
have
an
end
,
even
houses
that
people
take
infinite
pains
*NL*
to
see
and
are
tired
of
before
they
begin
to
see
them
.
He
has
come
to
*NL*
the
end
of
the
sight
,
and
the
fresh
village
beauty
to
the
end
of
her
*NL*
description
;
which
is
always
this
:
``
The
terrace
below
is
much
*NL*
admired
.
It
is
called
,
from
an
old
story
in
the
family

the
Ghost
's
*NL*
Walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
greedily
curious
.
``
What
's
the

Is
*NL*
it
anything
about

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
tell
us
the

says
Watt
in
a
half
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
it

Rosa
is
shyer
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
related
to

;
it
is
almost
forgotten

''
says
the
*NL*
housekeeper
,
advancing
.
``
It
has
never
been
more
than
a
family
*NL*
anecdote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
excuse
my
asking
again
if
it
has
anything

do
with
a

''
observes
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
because
I
do
assure
you
that
*NL*
the
more
I
think
of
that
picture
the
better
I
know
it
,
without
*NL*
knowing
how
I
know
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
picture
;
the
housekeeper
can
*NL*
guarantee
that
.
Mr.
Guppy
is
obliged
to
her
for
the
information
and
*NL*
is
,
moreover
,
generally
obliged
.
He
retires
with
his
friend
,
guided
*NL*
down
another
staircase
by
the
young
gardener
,
and
presently
is
heard
*NL*
to
drive
away
.
It
is
now
dusk
.
Mrs.
Rouncewell
can
trust
to
the
*NL*
discretion
of
her
two
young
hearers
and
may
tell
THEM
how
the
terrace
*NL*
came
to
have
that
ghostly
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seats
herself
in
a
large
chair
by
the
fast-darkening
window
and
*NL*
tells
them
:
``
In
the
wicked
days
,
my
dears
,
of
King
Charles
the
*NL*
First
--
I
mean
,
of
course
,
in
the
wicked
days
of
the
rebels
who
*NL*
leagued
themselves
against
that
excellent
king
--
Sir
Morbury
Dedlock
*NL*
was
the
owner
of
Chesney
Wold
.
Whether
there
was
any
account
of
a
*NL*
ghost
in
the
family
before
those
days
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
I
should
think
it
*NL*
very
likely
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
holds
this
opinion
because
she
considers
that
a
*NL*
family
of
such
antiquity
and
importance
has
a
right
to
a
ghost
.
She
*NL*
regards
a
ghost
as
one
of
the
privileges
of
the
upper
classes
,
a
*NL*
genteel
distinction
to
which
the
common
people
have
no
claim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Morbury
Dedlock
,
''
says
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
``
was
,
I
have
no
occasion
*NL*
to
say
,
on
the
side
of
the
blessed
martyr

But
it
IS
supposed
that
*NL*
his
Lady
,
who
had
none
of
the
family
blood
in
her
veins
,
favoured
the
*NL*
bad
cause
.
It
is
said
that
she
had
relations
among
King
Charles
's
*NL*
enemies
,
that
she
was
in
correspondence
with
them
,
and
that
she
gave
*NL*
them
information
.
When
any
of
the
country
gentlemen
who
followed
his
*NL*
Majesty
's
cause
met
here
,
it
is
said
that
my
Lady
was
always
nearer
*NL*
to
the
door
of
their
council-room
than
they
supposed
.
Do
you
hear
a
*NL*
sound
like
a
footstep
passing
along
the
terrace
,
Watt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
draws
nearer
to
the
housekeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
the
rain-drip
on
the
stones
,
''
replies
the
young
man
,
``
and
I
*NL*
hear
a
curious
echo
--
I
suppose
an
echo
--
which
is
very
like
a
halting
*NL*
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
gravely
nods
and
continues
:
``
Partly
on
account
of
*NL*
this
division
between
them
,
and
partly
on
other
accounts
,
Sir
Morbury
*NL*
and
his
Lady
led
a
troubled
life
.
She
was
a
lady
of
a
haughty
temper
.
*NL*
They
were
not
well
suited
to
each
other
in
age
or
character
,
and
they
*NL*
had
no
children
to
moderate
between
them
.
After
her
favourite
*NL*
brother
,
a
young
gentleman
,
was
killed
in
the
civil
wars
-LRB-
by
Sir
*NL*
Morbury
's
near
kinsman
-RRB-
,
her
feeling
was
so
violent
that
she
hated
*NL*
the
race
into
which
she
had
married
.
When
the
Dedlocks
were
about
to
*NL*
ride
out
from
Chesney
Wold
in
the
king
's
cause
,
she
is
supposed
to
*NL*
have
more
than
once
stolen
down
into
the
stables
in
the
dead
of
night
*NL*
and
lamed
their
horses
;
and
the
story
is
that
once
at
such
an
hour
,
*NL*
her
husband
saw
her
gliding
down
the
stairs
and
followed
her
into
the
*NL*
stall
where
his
own
favourite
horse
stood
.
There
he
seized
her
by
the
*NL*
wrist
,
and
in
a
struggle
or
in
a
fall
or
through
the
horse
being
*NL*
frightened
and
lashing
out
,
she
was
lamed
in
the
hip
and
from
that
*NL*
hour
began
to
pine
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
has
dropped
her
voice
to
a
little
more
than
a
*NL*
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
been
a
lady
of
a
handsome
figure
and
a
noble
carriage

She
*NL*
never
complained
of
the
change
;
she
never
spoke
to
any
one
of
being
*NL*
crippled
or
of
being
in
pain
,
but
day
by
day
she
tried
to
walk
upon
*NL*
the
terrace
,
and
with
the
help
of
the
stone
balustrade
,
went
up
and
*NL*
down
,
up
and
down
,
up
and
down
,
in
sun
and
shadow

with
greater

difficulty
every

At
last
,
one
afternoon
her
husband
-LRB-
to
whom
she
*NL*
had
never

on

persuasion

opened
her
lips
since
that
night

*NL*
standing
at

great
south

saw
her
drop
upon

He
hastened
down
to
raise

she
repulsed
him
as
he
bent
over

her

looking
at
him
fixedly

coldly

said
,

looks
at

in

looks
down

half
frightened

shy

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Covering
a
Multitude
of
Sins
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
interesting
when
I
dressed
before
daylight
to
peep
out
of
*NL*
window
,
where
my
candles
were
reflected
in
the
black
panes
like
*NL*
two
beacons
,
and
finding
all
beyond
still
enshrouded
in
the
*NL*
indistinctness
of
last
night
,
to
watch
how
it
turned
out
when
the
day
*NL*
came
on
.
As
the
prospect
gradually
revealed
itself
and
disclosed
the
*NL*
scene
over
which
the
wind
had
wandered
in
the
dark
,
like
my
memory
*NL*
over
my
life
,
I
had
a
pleasure
in
discovering
the
unknown
objects
*NL*
that
had
been
around
me
in
my
sleep
.
At
first
they
were
faintly
*NL*
discernible
in
the
mist
,
and
above
them
the
later
stars
still
*NL*
glimmered
.
That
pale
interval
over
,
the
picture
began
to
enlarge
and
*NL*
fill
up
so
fast
that
at
every
new
peep
I
could
have
found
enough
*NL*
to
look
at
for
an
hour
.
Imperceptibly
my
candles
became
the
only
*NL*
incongruous
part
of
the
morning
,
the
dark
places
in
my
room
all
*NL*
melted
away
,
and
the
day
shone
bright
upon
a
cheerful
landscape
,
*NL*
prominent
in
which
the
old
Abbey
Church
,
with
its
massive
tower
,
*NL*
threw
a
softer
train
of
shadow
on
the
view
than
seemed
compatible
*NL*
with
its
rugged
character
.
But
so
from
rough
outsides
-LRB-
I
hope
I
have
*NL*
learnt
-RRB-
,
serene
and
gentle
influences
often
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
part
of
the
house
was
in
such
order
,
and
every
one
was
so
*NL*
attentive
to
me
,
that
I
had
no
trouble
with
my
two
bunches
of
keys
,
*NL*
though
what
with
trying
to
remember
the
contents
of
each
little
*NL*
store-room
drawer
and
cupboard
;
and
what
with
making
notes
on
a
slate
*NL*
about
jams
,
and
pickles
,
and
preserves
,
and
bottles
,
and
glass
,
and
*NL*
china
,
and
a
great
many
other
things
;
and
what
with
being
generally
a
*NL*
methodical
,
old-maidish
sort
of
foolish
little
person
,
I
was
so
busy
*NL*
that
I
could
not
believe
it
was
breakfast-time
when
I
heard
the
bell
*NL*
ring
.
Away
I
ran
,
however
,
and
made
tea
,
as
I
had
already
been
*NL*
installed
into
the
responsibility
of
the
tea-pot
;
and
then
,
as
they
*NL*
were
all
rather
late
and
nobody
was
down
yet
,
I
thought
I
would
take
*NL*
a
peep
at
the
garden
and
get
some
knowledge
of
that
too
.
I
found
it
*NL*
quite
a
delightful
place
--
in
front
,
the
pretty
avenue
and
drive
by
*NL*
which
we
had
approached
-LRB-
and
where
,
by
the
by
,
we
had
cut
up
the
*NL*
gravel
so
terribly
with
our
wheels
that
I
asked
the
gardener
to
roll
*NL*
it
-RRB-
;
at
the
back
,
the
flower-garden
,
with
my
darling
at
her
window
up
*NL*
there
,
throwing
it
open
to
smile
out
at
me
,
as
if
she
would
have
*NL*
kissed
me
from
that
distance
.
Beyond
the
flower-garden
was
a
*NL*
kitchen-garden
,
and
then
a
paddock
,
and
then
a
snug
little
rick-yard
,
*NL*
and
then
a
dear
little
farm-yard
.
As
to
the
house
itself
,
with
its
*NL*
three
peaks
in
the
roof
;
its
various-shaped
windows
,
some
so
large
,
*NL*
some
so
small
,
and
all
so
pretty
;
its
trellis-work
,
against
the
*NL*
south-front
for
roses
and
honey-suckle
,
and
its
homely
,
comfortable
,
*NL*
welcoming
look
--
it
was
,
as
Ada
said
when
she
came
out
to
meet
me
with
*NL*
her
arm
through
that
of
its
master
,
worthy
of
her
cousin
John
,
a
bold
*NL*
thing
to
say
,
though
he
only
pinched
her
dear
cheek
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
was
as
agreeable
at
breakfast
as
he
had
been
overnight
.
*NL*
There
was
honey
on
the
table
,
and
it
led
him
into
a
discourse
about
*NL*
bees
.
He
had
no
objection
to
honey
,
he
said
-LRB-
and
I
should
think
he
*NL*
had
not
,
for
he
seemed
to
like
it
-RRB-
,
but
he
protested
against
the
*NL*
overweening
assumptions
of
bees
.
He
did
n't
at
all
see
why
the
busy
*NL*
bee
should
be
proposed
as
a
model
to
him
;
he
supposed
the
bee
liked
*NL*
to
make
honey
,
or
he
would
n't
do
it
--
nobody
asked
him
.
It
was
not
*NL*
necessary
for
the
bee
to
make
such
a
merit
of
his
tastes
.
If
every
*NL*
confectioner
went
buzzing
about
the
world
banging
against
everything
*NL*
that
came
in
his
way
and
egotistically
calling
upon
everybody
to
take
*NL*
notice
that
he
was
going
to
his
work
and
must
not
be
interrupted
,
the
*NL*
world
would
be
quite
an
unsupportable
place
.
Then
,
after
all
,
it
was
*NL*
a
ridiculous
position
to
be
smoked
out
of
your
fortune
with
brimstone
*NL*
as
soon
as
you
had
made
it
.
You
would
have
a
very
mean
opinion
of
a
*NL*
Manchester
man
if
he
spun
cotton
for
no
other
purpose
.
He
must
say
he
*NL*
thought
a
drone
the
embodiment
of
a
pleasanter
and
wiser
idea
.
The
*NL*
drone
said
unaffectedly
,
``
You
will
excuse
me
;
I
really
can
not
attend
*NL*
to
the
shop
!
I
find
myself
in
a
world
in
which
there
is
so
much
to
*NL*
see
and
so
short
a
time
to
see
it
in
that
I
must
take
the
liberty
of
*NL*
looking
about
me
and
begging
to
be
provided
for
by
somebody
who
*NL*
does
n't
want
to
look
about
him
.
''
This
appeared
to
Mr.
Skimpole
to
be
*NL*
the
drone
philosophy
,
and
he
thought
it
a
very
good
philosophy
,
*NL*
always
supposing
the
drone
to
be
willing
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
*NL*
bee
,
which
,
so
far
as
he
knew
,
the
easy
fellow
always
was
,
if
the
*NL*
consequential
creature
would
only
let
him
,
and
not
be
so
conceited
*NL*
about
his
honey
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
pursued
this
fancy
with
the
lightest
foot
over
a
variety
of
ground
*NL*
and
made
us
all
merry
,
though
again
he
seemed
to
have
as
serious
a
*NL*
meaning
in
what
he
said
as
he
was
capable
of
having
.
I
left
them
*NL*
still
listening
to
him
when
I
withdrew
to
attend
to
my
new
duties
.
*NL*
They
had
occupied
me
for
some
time
,
and
I
was
passing
through
the
*NL*
passages
on
my
return
with
my
basket
of
keys
on
my
arm
when
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
called
me
into
a
small
room
next
his
bed-chamber
,
which
I
*NL*
found
to
be
in
part
a
little
library
of
books
and
papers
and
in
part
*NL*
quite
a
little
museum
of
his
boots
and
shoes
and
hat-boxes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
This
,
you
must
know
,
is
the
*NL*
growlery
.
When
I
am
out
of
humour
,
I
come
and
growl
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
here
very
seldom
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
know
me
!
''
he
returned
.
``
When
I
am
deceived
or
*NL*
disappointed
in
--
the
wind
,
and
it
's
easterly
,
I
take
refuge
here
.
The
*NL*
growlery
is
the
best-used
room
in
the
house
.
You
are
not
aware
of
*NL*
half
my
humours
yet
.
My
dear
,
how
you
are
trembling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
it
;
I
tried
very
hard
,
but
being
alone
with
that
*NL*
benevolent
presence
,
and
meeting
his
kind
eyes
,
and
feeling
so
happy
*NL*
and
so
honoured
there
,
and
my
heart
so
full
--
I
kissed
his
hand
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
I
said
,
or
even
that
I
spoke
.
He
was
disconcerted
and
*NL*
walked
to
the
window
;
I
almost
believed
with
an
intention
of
jumping
*NL*
out
,
until
he
turned
and
I
was
reassured
by
seeing
in
his
eyes
what
*NL*
he
had
gone
there
to
hide
.
He
gently
patted
me
on
the
head
,
and
I
sat
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
There
!
''
he
said
.
``
That
's
over
.
Pooh
!
Do
n't
be
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
not
happen
again
,
sir
,
''
I
returned
,
``
but
at
first
it
is
*NL*
difficult
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
easy
,
easy
.
Why
not
?
I
hear
of
a
good
*NL*
little
orphan
girl
without
a
protector
,
and
I
take
it
into
my
head
to
*NL*
be
that
protector
.
She
grows
up
,
and
more
than
justifies
my
good
*NL*
opinion
,
and
I
remain
her
guardian
and
her
friend
.
What
is
there
in
*NL*
all
this
?
So
,
so
!
Now
,
we
have
cleared
off
old
scores
,
and
I
have
*NL*
before
me
thy
pleasant
,
trusting
,
trusty
face
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
to
myself
,
``
Esther
,
my
dear
,
you
surprise
me
!
This
really
is
*NL*
not
what
I
expected
of
you
!
''
And
it
had
such
a
good
effect
that
I
*NL*
folded
my
hands
upon
my
basket
and
quite
recovered
myself
.
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
expressing
his
approval
in
his
face
,
began
to
talk
to
me
as
*NL*
confidentially
as
if
I
had
been
in
the
habit
of
conversing
with
him
*NL*
every
morning
for
I
do
n't
know
how
long
.
I
almost
felt
as
if
I
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
Esther
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
do
n't
understand
this
Chancery
*NL*
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
of
course
I
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
who
does
,
''
he
returned
.
``
The
lawyers
have
twisted
it
*NL*
into
such
a
state
of
bedevilment
that
the
original
merits
of
the
case
*NL*
have
long
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
It
's
about
a
will
*NL*
and
the
trusts
under
a
will
--
or
it
was
once
.
It
's
about
nothing
but
*NL*
costs
now
.
We
are
always
appearing
,
and
disappearing
,
and
swearing
,
*NL*
and
interrogating
,
and
filing
,
and
cross-filing
,
and
arguing
,
and
*NL*
sealing
,
and
motioning
,
and
referring
,
and
reporting
,
and
revolving
*NL*
about
the
Lord
Chancellor
and
all
his
satellites
,
and
equitably
*NL*
waltzing
ourselves
off
to
dusty
death
,
about
costs
.
That
's
the
great
*NL*
question
.
All
the
rest
,
by
some
extraordinary
means
,
has
melted
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
to
bring
him
back
,
for
he
began
to
rub
his
*NL*
head
,
``
about
a
will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
it
was
about
a
will
when
it
was
about
anything
,
''
he
*NL*
returned
.
``
A
certain
Jarndyce
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
made
a
great
fortune
,
*NL*
and
made
a
great
will
.
In
the
question
how
the
trusts
under
that
will
*NL*
are
to
be
administered
,
the
fortune
left
by
the
will
is
squandered
*NL*
away
;
the
legatees
under
the
will
are
reduced
to
such
a
miserable
*NL*
condition
that
they
would
be
sufficiently
punished
if
they
had
*NL*
committed
an
enormous
crime
in
having
money
left
them
,
and
the
will
*NL*
itself
is
made
a
dead
letter
.
All
through
the
deplorable
cause
,
*NL*
everything
that
everybody
in
it
,
except
one
man
,
knows
already
is
*NL*
referred
to
that
only
one
man
who
do
n't
know
,
it
to
find
out
--
all
*NL*
through
the
deplorable
cause
,
everybody
must
have
copies
,
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
of
everything
that
has
accumulated
about
it
in
the
way
of
*NL*
cartloads
of
papers
-LRB-
or
must
pay
for
them
without
having
them
,
which
*NL*
is
the
usual
course
,
for
nobody
wants
them
-RRB-
and
must
go
down
the
*NL*
middle
and
up
again
through
such
an
infernal
country-dance
of
costs
*NL*
and
fees
and
nonsense
and
corruption
as
was
never
dreamed
of
in
the
*NL*
wildest
visions
of
a
witch
's
Sabbath
.
Equity
sends
questions
to
law
,
*NL*
law
sends
questions
back
to
equity
;
law
finds
it
ca
n't
do
this
,
*NL*
equity
finds
it
ca
n't
do
that
;
neither
can
so
much
as
say
it
ca
n't
*NL*
do
anything
,
without
this
solicitor
instructing
and
this
counsel
*NL*
appearing
for
A
,
and
that
solicitor
instructing
and
that
counsel
*NL*
appearing
for
B
;
and
so
on
through
the
whole
alphabet
,
like
the
*NL*
history
of
the
apple
pie
.
And
thus
,
through
years
and
years
,
and
*NL*
lives
and
lives
,
everything
goes
on
,
constantly
beginning
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
and
nothing
ever
ends
.
And
we
ca
n't
get
out
of
the
suit
*NL*
on
any
terms

for
we
are
made
parties
to
it

MUST
BE
parties
to
*NL*
it
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
.
But
it
wo
n't
do
to
think
of
it
!
When
*NL*
my
great
uncle
,
poor
Tom
Jarndyce
,
began
to
think
of
it
,
it
was
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
sir
,
whose
story
I
have
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
gravely
.
``
I
was
his
heir
,
and
this
was
his
house
,
Esther
.
*NL*
When
I
came
here
,
it
was
bleak
indeed
.
He
had
left
the
signs
of
his
*NL*
misery
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
changed
it
must
be
now
!
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
had
been
called
,
before
his
time
,
the
Peaks
.
He
gave
it
its
*NL*
present
name
and
lived
here
shut
up
,
day
and
night
poring
over
the
*NL*
wicked
heaps
of
papers
in
the
suit
and
hoping
against
hope
to
*NL*
disentangle
it
from
its
mystification
and
bring
it
to
a
close
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
,
the
place
became
dilapidated
,
the
wind
whistled
through
the
*NL*
cracked
walls
,
the
rain
fell
through
the
broken
roof
,
the
weeds
*NL*
choked
the
passage
to
the
rotting
door
.
When
I
brought
what
remained
*NL*
of
him
home
here
,
the
brains
seemed
to
me
to
have
been
blown
out
of
*NL*
the
house
too
,
it
was
so
shattered
and
ruined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
a
little
to
and
fro
after
saying
this
to
himself
with
a
*NL*
shudder
,
and
then
looked
at
me
,
and
brightened
,
and
came
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you

the

Where
was
I

*NL*
*NL*
I
reminded
him
,
at
the
hopeful
change
he
had
made
in
Bleak
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bleak
House
;
true

There
is

in

city
of
London
there
,
some
*NL*
property
of

which
is
much
at
this
day
what
Bleak
House
was
then
;
*NL*
I
say
property
of
ours
,
meaning
of
the
suit
's
,
but
I
ought
to
call
it
*NL*
the
property
of
costs
,
for
costs
is
the
only
power
on
earth
that
will
*NL*
ever
get
anything
out
of
it
now
or
will
ever
know
it
for
anything
but
*NL*
an
eyesore
and
a
heartsore
.
It
is
a
street
of
perishing
blind
houses
,
*NL*
with
their
eyes
stoned
out
,
without
a
pane
of
glass
,
without
so
much
*NL*
as
a
window-frame
,
with
the
bare
blank
shutters
tumbling
from
their
*NL*
hinges
and
falling
asunder
,
the
iron
rails
peeling
away
in
flakes
of
*NL*
rust
,
the
chimneys
sinking
in
,
the
stone
steps
to
every
door
-LRB-
and
*NL*
every
door
might
be
death
's
door
-RRB-
turning
stagnant
green
,
the
very
*NL*
crutches
on
which
the
ruins
are
propped
decaying
.
Although
Bleak
*NL*
House
was
not
in
Chancery
,
its
master
was
,
and
it
was
stamped
with
*NL*
the
same
seal
.
These
are
the
Great
Seal

my

all
*NL*
over
England

the

them

*NL*

``
How
changed
it
is

I
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

so
it
is

''
he
answered
much
more
cheerfully
;
``

it
is
wisdom

in
you

keep
me

The

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
had
better
call
me
guardian

my
dear

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
was
choking
again
--
I
taxed
myself
with
it
,
``
Esther

*NL*

you
know
you
are

when
he
feigned
to
say
this
slightly
,
as
if
*NL*
it
were
a
whim
instead
of
a
thoughtful
tenderness
.
But
I
gave
the
*NL*
housekeeping
keys
the
least
shake
in
the
world
as
a
reminder
to
*NL*
myself
,
and
folding
my
hands
in
a
still
more
determined
manner
on
the
*NL*
basket
,
looked
at
him
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
guardian

''
said
I
,
``
that
you
may
not
trust
too
much
to
my
*NL*
discretion

I
hope
you
may
not
mistake
me

I
am
afraid
it
will
be
a
*NL*
disappointment
to
you
to
know
that
I
am
not
clever
,
but
it
really
is
*NL*
the
truth
,
and
you
would
soon
find
it
out

I
had
not
the
honesty
to
*NL*
confess
it

*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
seem
at
all
disappointed
;
quite
the
contrary
.
He
told
me
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
all
over
his
face
,
that
he
knew
me
very
well
indeed
and
*NL*
that
I
was
quite
clever
enough
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
may
turn
out
so
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
I
am
much
afraid
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
clever
enough
to
be

he
returned
playfully

This

stretching
out

He
began
to
rub
his
head
again
and
to
hint
that
he
felt
the
wind

But
*NL*
it
was
a
delightful
instance
of
his
kindness
towards
me
that
whether
*NL*
he
rubbed
his
head

walked
about

or
did
both

his
face
was
sure
*NL*
to
recover
its
benignant

it
looked
at
mine

and
he
was

sure
to
turn
comfortable
again
and
put
his

in

stretch
out

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
really
was
frightened
at
the
thought
of
the
importance
I
was
*NL*
attaining
and
the
number
of
things
that
were
being
confided
to
me

I
*NL*
had
not
meant
this
at
all

I
had
meant
that
he
should
speak
to

Richard

But
of
course
I
said
nothing
in
reply
except
that
I
would
do
*NL*
my
best

though
I
feared
-LRB-
I
really
felt
it
necessary
to
repeat
this
-RRB-
*NL*
that
he
thought
me
much
more
sagacious
than
I
was

At
which
my
*NL*
guardian
only
laughed
the
pleasantest
laugh
I
ever
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!

he
said
,
rising
and
pushing
back
his
chair
.
``
I
think
we
may
*NL*
have
done

Only

Esther

my

do
you

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
attentively
at
me
that
I
looked
attentively
at
him
and
*NL*
felt
sure
I
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
I
,
venturing
to
put
my
hand
,
which
was
suddenly
*NL*
colder
than
I
could
have
wished
,
in
his
,
``
nothing

I
am
quite
sure

reliance
*NL*

confidence
were
not
placed
in

I
must
have
a
hard
heart

indeed

I
have
nothing

ask
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
my
hand
through
his
arm
and
we
went
away
to
look
for
Ada
.
*NL*
From
that
hour
I
felt
quite
easy
with
him
,
quite
unreserved
,
quite
*NL*
content
to
know
no
more
,
quite
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lived
,
at
first
,
rather
a
busy
life
at
Bleak
House
,
for
we
had
to
*NL*
become
acquainted
with
many
residents
in
and
out
of
the
neighbourhood
*NL*
who
knew
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
It
seemed
to
Ada
and
me
that
everybody
knew
*NL*
him
who
wanted
to
do
anything
with
anybody
else
's
money
.
It
amazed
us
*NL*
when
we
began
to
sort
his
letters
and
to
answer
some
of
them
for
him
*NL*
in
the
growlery
of
a
morning
to
find
how
the
great
object
of
the
*NL*
lives
of
nearly
all
his
correspondents
appeared
to
be
to
form
*NL*
themselves
into
committees
for
getting
in
and
laying
out
money
.
The
*NL*
ladies
were
as
desperate
as
the
gentlemen
;
indeed
,
I
think
they
were
*NL*
even
more
so
.
They
threw
themselves
into
committees
in
the
most
*NL*
impassioned
manner
and
collected
subscriptions
with
a
vehemence
quite
*NL*
extraordinary
.
It
appeared
to
us
that
some
of
them
must
pass
their
*NL*
whole
lives
in
dealing
out
subscription-cards
to
the
whole
*NL*
post-office
directory
--
shilling
cards
,
half-crown
cards
,
*NL*
half-sovereign
cards
,
penny
cards
.
They
wanted
everything
.
They
*NL*
wanted
wearing
apparel
,
they
wanted
linen
rags
,
they
wanted
money
,
*NL*
they
wanted
coals
,
they
wanted
soup
,
they
wanted
interest
,
they
*NL*
wanted
autographs
,
they
wanted
flannel
,
they
wanted
whatever
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
had
--
or
had
not
.
Their
objects
were
as
various
as
their
*NL*
demands
.
They
were
going
to
raise
new
buildings
,
they
were
going
to
*NL*
pay
off
debts
on
old
buildings
,
they
were
going
to
establish
in
a
*NL*
picturesque
building
-LRB-
engraving
of
proposed
west
elevation
attached
-RRB-
*NL*
the
Sisterhood
of
Mediaeval
Marys
,
they
were
going
to
give
a
*NL*
testimonial
to
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
they
were
going
to
have
their
*NL*
secretary
's
portrait
painted
and
presented
to
his
mother-in-law
,
*NL*
whose
deep
devotion
to
him
was
well
known
,
they
were
going
to
get
up
*NL*
everything
,
I
really
believe
,
from
five
hundred
thousand
tracts
to
an
*NL*
annuity
and
from
a
marble
monument
to
a
silver
tea-pot
.
They
took
a
*NL*
multitude
of
titles
.
They
were
the
Women
of
England
,
the
Daughters
of
*NL*
Britain
,
the
Sisters
of
all
the
cardinal
virtues
separately
,
the
*NL*
Females
of
America
,
the
Ladies
of
a
hundred
denominations
.
They
*NL*
appeared
to
be
always
excited
about
canvassing
and
electing
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
our
poor
wits
,
and
according
to
their
own
accounts
,
to
be
*NL*
constantly
polling
people
by
tens
of
thousands
,
yet
never
bringing
*NL*
their
candidates
in
for
anything
.
It
made
our
heads
ache
to
think
,
on
*NL*
the
whole
,
what
feverish
lives
they
must
lead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
ladies
who
were
most
distinguished
for
this
rapacious
*NL*
benevolence
-LRB-
if
I
may
use
the
expression
-RRB-
was
a
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
who
*NL*
seemed
,
as
I
judged
from
the
number
of
her
letters
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
*NL*
to
be
almost
as
powerful
a
correspondent
as
Mrs.
Jellyby
herself
.
We
*NL*
observed
that
the
wind
always
changed
when
Mrs.
Pardiggle
became
the
*NL*
subject
of
conversation
and
that
it
invariably
interrupted
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
prevented
his
going
any
farther
,
when
he
had
remarked
*NL*
that
there
were
two
classes
of
charitable
people
;
one
,
the
people
who
*NL*
did
a
little
and
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
;
the
other
,
the
people
*NL*
who
did
a
great
deal
and
made
no
noise
at
all
.
We
were
therefore
*NL*
curious
to
see
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
suspecting
her
to
be
a
type
of
the
*NL*
former
class
,
and
were
glad
when
she
called
one
day
with
her
five
*NL*
young
sons
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
formidable
style
of
lady
with
spectacles
,
a
prominent
nose
,
*NL*
and
a
loud
voice
,
who
had
the
effect
of
wanting
a
great
deal
of
room
.
*NL*
And
she
really
did
,
for
she
knocked
down
little
chairs
with
her
*NL*
skirts
that
were
quite
a
great
way
off
.
As
only
Ada
and
I
were
at
*NL*
home
,
we
received
her
timidly
,
for
she
seemed
to
come
in
like
cold
*NL*
weather
and
to
make
the
little
Pardiggles
blue
as
they
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
,
young
ladies
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
with
great
volubility
*NL*
after
the
first
salutations
,
``
are
my
five
boys
.
You
may
have
seen
*NL*
their
names
in
a
printed
subscription
list
-LRB-
perhaps
more
than
one
-RRB-
in
*NL*
the
possession
of
our
esteemed
friend
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
Egbert
,
my
eldest
*NL*
-LRB-

is
the
boy
who
sent
out
his
pocket-money
,
to
the
amount
of
*NL*
five
and
threepence
,
to
the
Tockahoopo
Indians
.
Oswald
,
my
second
*NL*
-LRB-
ten
and
a
half
-RRB-
,
is
the
child
who
contributed
two
and
nine-pence
to
*NL*
the
Great
National
Smithers
Testimonial

Francis

my
third

voluntarily
*NL*
enrolled
himself
in
the
Infant
Bonds
of

,
and
is
pledged
never
,
*NL*
through
life
,
to
use
tobacco
in
any
form
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
never
seen
such
dissatisfied
children
.
It
was
not
merely
that
*NL*
they
were
weazened
and
shrivelled
--
though
they
were
certainly
that
*NL*
too
--
but
they
looked
absolutely
ferocious
with
discontent
.
At
the
*NL*
mention
of
the
Tockahoopo
Indians
,
I
could
really
have
supposed
*NL*
Egbert
to
be
one
of
the
most
baleful
members
of
that
tribe
,
he
gave
*NL*
me
such
a
savage
frown
.
The
face
of
each
child
,
as
the
amount
of
his
*NL*
contribution
was
mentioned
,
darkened
in
a
peculiarly
vindictive
*NL*
manner
,
but
his
was
by
far
the
worst
.
I
must
except
,
however
,
the
*NL*
little
recruit
into
the
Infant
Bonds
of
Joy
,
who
was
stolidly
and
*NL*
evenly
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
visiting
,
I
understand
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
``
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
's

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
yes
,
we
had
passed
one
night
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
''
pursued
the
lady
,
always
speaking
in
the
same
*NL*
demonstrative
,
loud
,
hard
tone
,
so
that
her
voice
impressed
my
fancy
*NL*
as
if
it
had
a
sort
of
spectacles
on
too
--
and
I
may
take
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
remarking
that
her
spectacles
were
made
the
less
*NL*
engaging
by
her
eyes
being
what
Ada
called
``
choking
eyes
,
''
meaning
*NL*
very
prominent
--
``

I
do

I
do
not
go
with
Mrs.
Jellyby
in
her
treatment
*NL*
of
her
young
family
.
It
has
been
noticed
.
It
has
been
observed
that
*NL*
her
young
family
are
excluded
from
participation
in
the
objects
to
*NL*
which
she
is
devoted
.
She
may
be
right
,
she
may
be
wrong
;
but
,
right
*NL*
or
wrong
,
this
is
not
my
course
with
MY
young
family
.
I
take
them
*NL*
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
afterwards
convinced
-LRB-
and
so
was
Ada
-RRB-
that
from
the
*NL*
ill-conditioned
eldest
child
,
these
words
extorted
a
sharp
yell
.
He
*NL*
turned
it
off
into
a
yawn
,
but
it
began
as
a
yell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
attend
matins
with
me
-LRB-
very
prettily
done
-RRB-
at
half-past
six
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
all
the
year
round
,
including
of
course
the
*NL*
depth
of
winter
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
rapidly
,
``
and
they
are
with
me
*NL*
during
the
revolving
duties
of
the
day
.
I
am
a
School
lady
,
I
am
a
*NL*
Visiting
lady
,
I
am
a
Reading
lady
,
I
am
a
Distributing
lady
;
I
am
on
*NL*
the
local
Linen
Box
Committee
and
many
general
committees
;
and
my
*NL*
canvassing
alone
is
very
extensive
--
perhaps
no
one
's
more
so
.
But
*NL*
they
are
my
companions
everywhere
;
and
by
these
means
they
acquire
*NL*
that
knowledge
of
the
poor
,
and
that
capacity
of
doing
charitable
*NL*
business
in
general
--
in
short
,
that
taste
for
the
sort
of
*NL*
thing
--
which
will
render
them
in
after
life
a
service
to
their
*NL*
neighbours
and
a
satisfaction
to
themselves
.
My
young
family
are
not
*NL*
frivolous
;
they
expend
the
entire
amount
of
their
allowance
in
*NL*
subscriptions
,
under
my
direction
;
and
they
have
attended
as
many
*NL*
public
meetings
and
listened
to
as
many
lectures
,
orations
,
and
*NL*
discussions
as
generally
fall
to
the
lot
of
few
grown
people

Alfred

,
who
,
as
I
mentioned
,
has
of
his
own
election
joined
the
*NL*
Infant
Bonds
of
Joy
,
was
one
of
the
very
few
children
who
manifested
*NL*
consciousness
on
that
occasion
after
a
fervid
address
of
two
hours
*NL*
from
the
chairman
of
the
evening

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alfred
glowered
at
us
as
if
he
never
could
,

would
,
forgive
the
*NL*
injury
of
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
have
observed
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
``
in
*NL*
some
of
the
lists
to
which
I
have
referred
,
in
the
possession
of
our
*NL*
esteemed
friend
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
that
the
names
of
my
young
family
are
*NL*
concluded
with
the
name
of
O.
A.
Pardiggle
,
F.R.S.
,
one
pound
.
That
*NL*
is
their
father
.
We
usually
observe
the
same
routine
.
I
put
down
my
*NL*
mite
first
;
then
my
young
family
enrol
their
contributions
,
according
*NL*
to
their
ages
and
their
little
means
;
and
then
Mr.
Pardiggle
brings
*NL*
up
the
rear
.
Mr.
Pardiggle
is
happy
to
throw
in
his
limited
donation
,
*NL*
under
my
direction
;
and
thus
things
are
made
not
only
pleasant
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
but
,
we
trust
,
improving
to
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suppose
Mr.
Pardiggle
were
to
dine
with
Mr.
Jellyby
,
and
suppose
Mr.
*NL*
Jellyby
were
to
relieve
his
mind
after
dinner
to
Mr.
Pardiggle
,
would
*NL*
Mr.
Pardiggle
,
in
return
,
make
any
confidential
communication
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jellyby
?
I
was
quite
confused
to
find
myself
thinking
this
,
but
it
*NL*
came
into
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
pleasantly
situated
here
!
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
glad
to
change
the
subject
,
and
going
to
the
window
,
pointed
*NL*
out
the
beauties
of
the
prospect
,
on
which
the
spectacles
appeared
to
*NL*
me
to
rest
with
curious
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Mr.
Gusher
?
''
said
our
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
obliged
to
say
that
we
had
not
the
pleasure
of
Mr.
Gusher
's
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
loss
is
yours
,
I
assure
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
with
her
*NL*
commanding
deportment
.
``
He
is
a
very
fervid

impassioned

speaker

from

naturally
adapted

would
improve
almost
any
occasion

could
mention
for

hours
and
hours

By
this
time

said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
*NL*
moving
back
to
her
chair
and
overturning
,
as
if
by
invisible
agency
,
*NL*
a
little
round
table
at
a
considerable
distance
with
my
work-basket
*NL*
on
it
,
``
by
this
time
you
have
found
me
out
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
really
such
a
confusing
question
that
Ada
looked
at
me
in
*NL*
perfect
dismay
.
As
to
the
guilty
nature
of
my
own
consciousness
after
*NL*
what
I
had
been
thinking
,
it
must
have
been
expressed
in
the
colour
*NL*
of
my
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Found
out
,
I
mean
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
``
the
prominent
point
in
my
*NL*
character
.
I
am
aware
that
it
is
so
prominent
as
to
be
discoverable
*NL*
immediately
.
I
lay
myself
open
to
detection
,
I
know
.
Well
!
I
freely
*NL*
admit
,
I
am
a
woman
of
business
.
I
love
hard
work
;
I
enjoy
hard
work
.
*NL*
The
excitement
does
me
good
.
I
am
so
accustomed
and
inured
to
hard
*NL*
work
that
I
do
n't
know
what
fatigue
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
murmured
that
it
was
very
astonishing
and
very
gratifying
,
or
*NL*
something
to
that
effect
.
I
do
n't
think
we
knew
what
it
was
either
,
*NL*
but
this
is
what
our
politeness
expressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
what
it
is
to
be
tired
;
you
can
not
tire
me
if
*NL*
you
try
!
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
.
``
The
quantity
of
exertion
-LRB-
which
is
no
*NL*
exertion
to
me
-RRB-
,
the
amount
of
business
-LRB-
which
I
regard
as
nothing
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
I
go
through
sometimes
astonishes
myself
.
I
have
seen
my
young
*NL*
family
,
and
Mr.
Pardiggle
,
quite
worn
out
with
witnessing
it
,
when
I
*NL*
may
truly
say
I
have
been
as
fresh
as
a
lark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
that
dark-visaged
eldest
boy
could
look
more
malicious
than
he
had
*NL*
already
looked
,
this
was
the
time
when
he
did
it
.
I
observed
that
he
*NL*
doubled
his
right
fist
and
delivered
a
secret
blow
into
the
crown
of
*NL*
his
cap
,
which
was
under
his
left
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
gives
me
a
great
advantage
when
I
am
making
my
rounds
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Pardiggle
.
``
If
I
find
a
person
unwilling
to
hear
what
I
have
to
*NL*
say
,
I
tell
that
person
directly
,
'
I
am
incapable
of
fatigue
,
my
good
*NL*
friend
,
I
am
never
tired
,
and
I
mean
to
go
on
until
I
have
done
.
'
It
*NL*
answers
admirably
!
Miss
Summerson
,
I
hope
I
shall
have
your
*NL*
assistance
in
my
visiting
rounds
immediately
,
and
Miss
Clare
's
very
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
tried
to
excuse
myself
for
the
present
on
the
general
*NL*
ground
of
having
occupations
to
attend
to
which
I
must
not
neglect
.
*NL*
But
as
this
was
an
ineffectual
protest
,
I
then
said
,
more
*NL*
particularly
,
that
I
was
not
sure
of
my
qualifications
.
That
I
was
*NL*
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
adapting
my
mind
to
minds
very
*NL*
differently
situated
,
and
addressing
them
from
suitable
points
of
*NL*
view
.
That
I
had
not
that
delicate
knowledge
of
the
heart
which
must
*NL*
be
essential
to
such
a
work
.
That
I
had
much
to
learn
,
myself
,
before
*NL*
I
could
teach
others
,
and
that
I
could
not
confide
in
my
good
*NL*
intentions
alone
.
For
these
reasons
I
thought
it
best
to
be
as
useful
*NL*
as
I
could
,
and
to
render
what
kind
services
I
could
to
those
*NL*
immediately
about
me
,
and
to
try
to
let
that
circle
of
duty
gradually
*NL*
and
naturally
expand
itself
.
All
this
I
said
with
anything
but
*NL*
confidence
,
because
Mrs.
Pardiggle
was
much
older
than
I
,
and
had
*NL*
great
experience
,
and
was
so
very
military
in
her
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
she
,
``
but
perhaps
you
are
not
*NL*
equal
to
hard
work
or
the
excitement
of
it
,
and
that
makes
a
vast
*NL*
difference
.
If
you
would
like
to
see
how
I
go
through
my
work
,
I
am
*NL*
now
about
--
with
my
young
family
--
to
visit
a
brickmaker
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
-LRB-
a
very
bad
character
-RRB-
and
shall
be
glad
to
take
you
*NL*
with
me
.
Miss
Clare
also
,
if
she
will
do
me
the
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
and
I
interchanged
looks
,
and
as
we
were
going
out
in
any
case
,
*NL*
accepted
the
offer
.
When
we
hastily
returned
from
putting
on
our
*NL*
bonnets
,
we
found
the
young
family
languishing
in
a
corner
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Pardiggle
sweeping
about
the
room
,
knocking
down
nearly
all
the
light
*NL*
objects
it
contained
.
Mrs.
Pardiggle
took
possession
of
Ada
,
and
I
*NL*
followed
with
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
told
me
afterwards
that
Mrs.
Pardiggle
talked
in
the
same
loud
*NL*
tone
-LRB-
that
,
indeed
,
I
overheard
-RRB-
all
the
way
to
the
brickmaker
's
*NL*
about
an
exciting
contest
which
she
had
for
two
or
three
years
waged
*NL*
against
another
lady
relative
to
the
bringing
in
of
their
rival
*NL*
candidates
for
a
pension
somewhere
.
There
had
been
a
quantity
of
*NL*
printing
,
and
promising
,
and
proxying
,
and
polling
,
and
it
appeared
*NL*
to
have
imparted
great
liveliness
to
all
concerned
,
except
the
*NL*
pensioners
--
who
were
not
elected
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
very
fond
of
being
confided
in
by
children
and
am
happy
in
being
*NL*
usually
favoured
in
that
respect
,
but
on
this
occasion
it
gave
me
*NL*
great
uneasiness
.
As
soon
as
we
were
out
of
doors
,
Egbert
,
with
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
little
footpad
,
demanded
a
shilling
of
me
on
the
ground
*NL*
that
his
pocket-money
was
``
boned
''
from
him
.
On
my
pointing
out
the
*NL*
great
impropriety
of
the
word
,
especially
in
connexion
with
his
*NL*
parent
-LRB-
for
he
added
sulkily
``
By
her
!
''
-RRB-
,
he
pinched
me
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
*NL*
then
!
Now
!
Who
are
you
!
YOU
would
n't
like
it
,
I
think
?
What
does
she
*NL*
make
a
sham
for
,
and
pretend
to
give
me
money
,
and
take
it
away
*NL*
again
?
Why
do
you
call
it
my
allowance
,
and
never
let
me
spend
it
?
''
*NL*
These
exasperating
questions
so
inflamed
his
mind
and
the
minds
of
*NL*
Oswald
and
Francis
that
they
all
pinched
me
at
once
,
and
in
a
*NL*
dreadfully
expert
way
--
screwing
up
such
little
pieces
of
my
arms
that
*NL*
I
could
hardly
forbear
crying
out
.
Felix
,
at
the
same
time
,
stamped
*NL*
upon
my
toes
.
And
the
Bond
of
Joy
,
who
on
account
of
always
having
*NL*
the
whole
of
his
little
income
anticipated
stood
in
fact
pledged
to
*NL*
abstain
from
cakes
as
well
as
tobacco
,
so
swelled
with
grief
and
rage
*NL*
when
we
passed
a
pastry-cook
's
shop
that
he
terrified
me
by
becoming
*NL*
purple
.
I
never
underwent
so
much
,
both
in
body
and
mind
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
walk
with
young
people
as
from
these
unnaturally
*NL*
constrained
children
when
they
paid
me
the
compliment
of
being
*NL*
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
glad
when
we
came
to
the
brickmaker
's
house
,
though
it
was
one
*NL*
of
a
cluster
of
wretched
hovels
in
a
brick-field
,
with
pigsties
close
*NL*
to
the
broken
windows
and
miserable
little
gardens
before
the
doors
*NL*
growing
nothing
but
stagnant
pools
.
Here
and
there
an
old
tub
was
put
*NL*
to
catch
the
droppings
of
rain-water
from
a
roof
,
or
they
were
banked
*NL*
up
with
mud
into
a
little
pond
like
a
large
dirt-pie
.
At
the
doors
*NL*
and
windows
some
men
and
women
lounged
or
prowled
about
,
and
took
*NL*
little
notice
of
us
except
to
laugh
to
one
another
or
to
say
*NL*
something
as
we
passed
about
gentlefolks
minding
their
own
business
*NL*
and
not
troubling
their
heads
and
muddying
their
shoes
with
coming
to
*NL*
look
after
other
people
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
leading
the
way
with
a
great
show
of
moral
*NL*
determination
and
talking
with
much
volubility
about
the
untidy
*NL*
habits
of
the
people
-LRB-
though
I
doubted
if
the
best
of
us
could
have
*NL*
been
tidy
in
such
a
place
-RRB-
,
conducted
us
into
a
cottage
at
the
*NL*
farthest
corner
,
the
ground-floor
room
of
which
we
nearly
filled
.
*NL*
Besides
ourselves
,
there
were
in
this
damp
,
offensive
room
a
woman
*NL*
with
a
black
eye
,
nursing
a
poor
little
gasping
baby
by
the
fire
;
a
*NL*
man
,
all
stained
with
clay
and
mud
and
looking
very
dissipated
,
lying
*NL*
at
full
length
on
the
ground
,
smoking
a
pipe
;
a
powerful
young
man
*NL*
fastening
a
collar
on
a
dog
;
and
a
bold
girl
doing
some
kind
of
*NL*
washing
in
very
dirty
water
.
They
all
looked
up
at
us
as
we
came
in
,
*NL*
and
the
woman
seemed
to
turn
her
face
towards
the
fire
as
if
to
hide
*NL*
her
bruised
eye
;
nobody
gave
us
any
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
friends
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
but
her
voice
had
not
a
*NL*
friendly
sound
,
I
thought
;
it
was
much
too
business-like
and
*NL*
systematic
.
``
How
do
you
do
,
all
of
you
?
I
am
here
again
.
I
told
you
,
*NL*
you
could
n't
tire
me
,
you
know
.
I
am
fond
of
hard
work
,
and
am
true
*NL*
to
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
a
n't
,
''
growled
the
man
on
the
floor
,
whose
head
rested
on
his
*NL*
hand
as
he
stared
at
us
,
``
any
more
on
you
to
come
in
,
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
seating
herself
on
one
stool
*NL*
and
knocking
down
another
.
``
We
are
all
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
thought
there
war
n't
enough
of
you
,
perhaps
?
''
said
the
*NL*
man
,
with
his
pipe
between
his
lips
as
he
looked
round
upon
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
and
the
girl
both
laughed
.
Two
friends
of
the
young
*NL*
man
,
whom
we
had
attracted
to
the
doorway
and
who
stood
there
with
*NL*
their
hands
in
their
pockets
,
echoed
the
laugh
noisily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
tire
me
,
good
people
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pardiggle
to
these
*NL*
latter
.
``
I
enjoy
hard
work
,
and
the
harder
you
make
mine
,
the
better
*NL*
I
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
make
it
easy
for
her
!
''
growled
the
man
upon
the
floor
.
``
I
wants
*NL*
it
done
,
and
over
.
I
wants
a
end
of
these
liberties
took
with
my
*NL*
place
.
I
wants
an
end
of
being
drawed
like
a
badger
.
Now
you
're
*NL*
a-going
to
poll-pry
and
question
according
to
custom
--
I
know
what
*NL*
you
're
a-going
to
be
up
to
.
Well
!
You
have
n't
got
no
occasion
to
be
*NL*
up
to
it
.
I
'll
save
you
the
trouble
.
Is
my
daughter
a-washin
?
Yes
,
*NL*
she
IS
a-washin
.
Look
at
the
water
.
Smell
it
!
That
's
wot
we
drinks
.
*NL*
How
do
you
like
it
,
and
what
do
you
think
of
gin
instead
!
A
n't
my
*NL*
place
dirty
?
Yes
,
it
is
dirty
--
it
's
nat
`
rally
dirty
,
and
it
's
*NL*
nat
`
rally
onwholesome
;
and
we
've
had
five
dirty
and
onwholesome
*NL*
children
,
as
is
all
dead
infants
,
and
so
much
the
better
for
them
,
*NL*
and
for
us
besides
.
Have
I
read
the
little
book
wot
you
left
?
No
,
I
*NL*
a
n't
read
the
little
book
wot
you
left
.
There
a
n't
nobody
here
as
*NL*
knows
how
to
read
it
;
and
if
there
wos
,
it
would
n't
be
suitable
to
*NL*
me
.
It
's
a
book
fit
for
a
babby
,
and
I
'm
not
a
babby
.
If
you
was
to
*NL*
leave
me
a
doll
,
I
should
n't
nuss
it
.
How
have
I
been
conducting
of
*NL*
myself
?
Why
,
I
've
been
drunk
for
three
days
;
and
I
`
da
been
drunk
four
*NL*
if
I
`
da
had
the
money
.
Do
n't
I
never
mean
for
to
go
to
church
?
No
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
never
mean
for
to
go
to
church
.
I
should
n't
be
expected
there
,
*NL*
if
I
did
;
the
beadle
's
too
gen-teel
for
me
.
And
how
did
my
wife
get
*NL*
that
black
eye
?
Why
,
I
give
it
her
;
and
if
she
says
I
did
n't
,
she
's
a
*NL*
lie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
pulled
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
all
this
,
and
he
now
*NL*
turned
over
on
his
other
side
and
smoked
again
.
Mrs.
Pardiggle
,
who
*NL*
had
been
regarding
him
through
her
spectacles
with
a
forcible
*NL*
composure
,
calculated
,
I
could
not
help
thinking
,
to
increase
his
*NL*
antagonism
,
pulled
out
a
good
book
as
if
it
were
a
constable
's
staff
*NL*
and
took
the
whole
family
into
custody
.
I
mean
into
religious
*NL*
custody
,
of
course
;
but
she
really
did
it
as
if
she
were
an
*NL*
inexorable
moral
policeman
carrying
them
all
off
to
a
station-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
and
I
were
very
uncomfortable
.
We
both
felt
intrusive
and
out
of
*NL*
place
,
and
we
both
thought
that
Mrs.
Pardiggle
would
have
got
on
*NL*
infinitely
better
if
she
had
not
had
such
a
mechanical
way
of
taking
*NL*
possession
of
people
.
The
children
sulked
and
stared
;
the
family
took
*NL*
no
notice
of
us
whatever
,
except
when
the
young
man
made
the
dog
*NL*
bark
,
which
he
usually
did
when
Mrs.
Pardiggle
was
most
emphatic
.
We
*NL*
both
felt
painfully
sensible
that
between
us
and
these
people
there
*NL*
was
an
iron
barrier
which
could
not
be
removed
by
our
new
friend
.
By
*NL*
whom
or
how
it
could
be
removed
,
we
did
not
know
,
but
we
knew
that
.
*NL*
Even
what
she
read
and
said
seemed
to
us
to
be
ill-chosen
for
such
*NL*
auditors
,
if
it
had
been
imparted
ever
so
modestly
and
with
ever
so
*NL*
much
tact
.
As
to
the
little
book
to
which
the
man
on
the
floor
had
*NL*
referred
,
we
acquired
a
knowledge
of
it
afterwards
,
and
Mr.
Jarndyce
*NL*
said
he
doubted
if
Robinson
Crusoe
could
have
read
it
,
though
he
had
*NL*
had
no
other
on
his
desolate
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
much
relieved
,
under
these
circumstances
,
when
Mrs.
Pardiggle
*NL*
left
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
on
the
floor
,
then
turning
his
head
round
again
,
said
*NL*
morosely
,
``
Well
!
You
've
done
,
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
to-day
,
I
have
,
my
friend
.
But
I
am
never
fatigued
.
I
shall
come
*NL*
to
you
again
in
your
regular
order
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Pardiggle
with
*NL*
demonstrative
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
you
goes
now
,
''
said
he
,
folding
his
arms
and
shutting
his
*NL*
eyes
with
an
oath
,
``
you
may
do
wot
you
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pardiggle
accordingly
rose
and
made
a
little
vortex
in
the
*NL*
confined
room
from
which
the
pipe
itself
very
narrowly
escaped
.
*NL*
Taking
one
of
her
young
family
in
each
hand
,
and
telling
the
others
*NL*
to
follow
closely
,
and
expressing
her
hope
that
the
brickmaker
and
*NL*
all
his
house
would
be
improved
when
she
saw
them
next
,
she
then
*NL*
proceeded
to
another
cottage
.
I
hope
it
is
not
unkind
in
me
to
say
*NL*
that
she
certainly
did
make
,
in
this
as
in
everything
else
,
a
show
*NL*
that
was
not
conciliatory
of
doing
charity
by
wholesale
and
of
*NL*
dealing
in
it
to
a
large
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
supposed
that
we
were
following
her
,
but
as
soon
as
the
space
was
*NL*
left
clear
,
we
approached
the
woman
sitting
by
the
fire
to
ask
if
the
*NL*
baby
were
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
looked
at
it
as
it
lay
on
her
lap
.
We
had
observed
before
*NL*
that
when
she
looked
at
it
she
covered
her
discoloured
eye
with
her
*NL*
hand
,
as
though
she
wished
to
separate
any
association
with
noise
and
*NL*
violence
and
ill
treatment
from
the
poor
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
,
whose
gentle
heart
was
moved
by
its
appearance
,
bent
down
to
*NL*
touch
its
little
face
.
As
she
did
so
,
I
saw
what
happened
and
drew
*NL*
her
back
.
The
child
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Esther
!
''
cried
Ada
,
sinking
on
her
knees
beside
it
.
``
Look
here
!
*NL*
Oh
,
Esther
,
my
love
,
the
little
thing
!
The
suffering
,
quiet
,
pretty
*NL*
little
thing
!
I
am
so
sorry
for
it
.
I
am
so
sorry
for
the
mother
.
I
*NL*
never
saw
a
sight
so
pitiful
as
this
before
!
Oh
,
baby
,
baby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
compassion
,
such
gentleness
,
as
that
with
which
she
bent
down
*NL*
weeping
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
mother
's
might
have
softened
any
*NL*
mother
's
heart
that
ever
beat
.
The
woman
at
first
gazed
at
her
in
*NL*
astonishment
and
then
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
I
took
the
light
burden
from
her
lap
,
did
what
I
could
to
*NL*
make
the
baby
's
rest
the
prettier
and
gentler
,
laid
it
on
a
shelf
,
*NL*
and
covered
it
with
my
own
handkerchief
.
We
tried
to
comfort
the
*NL*
mother
,
and
we
whispered
to
her
what
Our
Saviour
said
of
children
.
*NL*
She
answered
nothing
,
but
sat
weeping
--
weeping
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
turned
,
I
found
that
the
young
man
had
taken
out
the
dog
and
*NL*
was
standing
at
the
door
looking
in
upon
us
with
dry
eyes
,
but
quiet
.
*NL*
The
girl
was
quiet
too
and
sat
in
a
corner
looking
on
the
ground
.
The
*NL*
man
had
risen
.
He
still
smoked
his
pipe
with
an
air
of
defiance
,
but
*NL*
he
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ugly
woman
,
very
poorly
clothed
,
hurried
in
while
I
was
glancing
*NL*
at
them
,
and
coming
straight
up
to
the
mother
,
said
,
``
Jenny
!
Jenny
!
''
*NL*
The
mother
rose
on
being
so
addressed
and
fell
upon
the
woman
's
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
also
had
upon
her
face
and
arms
the
marks
of
ill
usage
.
She
had
*NL*
no
kind
of
grace
about
her
,
but
the
grace
of
sympathy
;
but
when
she
*NL*
condoled
with
the
woman
,
and
her
own
tears
fell
,
she
wanted
no
*NL*
beauty
.
I
say
condoled
,
but
her
only
words
were
``
Jenny
!
Jenny
!
''
All
*NL*
the
rest
was
in
the
tone
in
which
she
said
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
very
touching
to
see
these
two
women
,
coarse
and
shabby
*NL*
and
beaten
,
so
united
;
to
see
what
they
could
be
to
one
another
;
to
*NL*
see
how
they
felt
for
one
another
,
how
the
heart
of
each
to
each
was
*NL*
softened
by
the
hard
trials
of
their
lives
.
I
think
the
best
side
of
*NL*
such
people
is
almost
hidden
from
us
.
What
the
poor
are
to
the
poor
*NL*
is
little
known
,
excepting
to
themselves
and
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
felt
it
better
to
withdraw
and
leave
them
uninterrupted
.
We
stole
*NL*
out
quietly
and
without
notice
from
any
one
except
the
man
.
He
was
*NL*
leaning
against
the
wall
near
the
door
,
and
finding
that
there
was
*NL*
scarcely
room
for
us
to
pass
,
went
out
before
us
.
He
seemed
to
want
*NL*
to
hide
that
he
did
this
on
our
account
,
but
we
perceived
that
he
*NL*
did
,
and
thanked
him
.
He
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
was
so
full
of
grief
all
the
way
home
,
and
Richard
,
whom
we
found
*NL*
at
home
,
was
so
distressed
to
see
her
in
tears
-LRB-
though
he
said
to
me
,
*NL*
when
she
was
not
present
,
how
beautiful
it
was
too
!
-RRB-
,
that
we
*NL*
arranged
to
return
at
night
with
some
little
comforts
and
repeat
our
*NL*
visit
at
the
brick-maker
's
house
.
We
said
as
little
as
we
could
to
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
but
the
wind
changed
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
accompanied
us
at
night
to
the
scene
of
our
morning
*NL*
expedition
.
On
our
way
there
,
we
had
to
pass
a
noisy
drinking-house
,
*NL*
where
a
number
of
men
were
flocking
about
the
door
.
Among
them
,
and
*NL*
prominent
in
some
dispute
,
was
the
father
of
the
little
child
.
At
a
*NL*
short
distance
,
we
passed
the
young
man
and
the
dog
,
in
congenial
*NL*
company
.
The
sister
was
standing
laughing
and
talking
with
some
other
*NL*
young
women
at
the
corner
of
the
row
of
cottages
,
but
she
seemed
*NL*
ashamed
and
turned
away
as
we
went
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
our
escort
within
sight
of
the
brickmaker
's
dwelling
and
*NL*
proceeded
by
ourselves
.
When
we
came
to
the
door
,
we
found
the
woman
*NL*
who
had
brought
such
consolation
with
her
standing
there
looking
*NL*
anxiously
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
you
,
young
ladies
,
is
it
?
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
a-watching
for
my
master
.
My
heart
's
in
my
mouth
.
If
he
was
to
catch
*NL*
me
away
from
home
,
he
'd
pretty
near
murder
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
your
husband
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
,
my
master
.
Jenny
's
asleep
,
quite
worn
out
.
She
's
scarcely
*NL*
had
the
child
off
her
lap
,
poor
thing
,
these
seven
days
and
nights
,
*NL*
except
when
I
've
been
able
to
take
it
for
a
minute
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
gave
way
for
us
,
she
went
softly
in
and
put
what
we
had
*NL*
brought
near
the
miserable
bed
on
which
the
mother
slept
.
No
effort
*NL*
had
been
made
to
clean
the
room
--
it
seemed
in
its
nature
almost
*NL*
hopeless
of
being
clean
;
but
the
small
waxen
form
from
which
so
much
*NL*
solemnity
diffused
itself
had
been
composed
afresh
,
and
washed
,
and
*NL*
neatly
dressed
in
some
fragments
of
white
linen
;
and
on
my
*NL*
handkerchief
,
which
still
covered
the
poor
baby
,
a
little
bunch
of
*NL*
sweet
herbs
had
been
laid
by
the
same
rough
,
scarred
hands
,
so
*NL*
lightly
,
so
tenderly
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
heaven
reward
you
!
''
we
said
to
her
.
``
You
are
a
good
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
young
ladies
?
''
she
returned
with
surprise
.
``
Hush
!
Jenny
,
Jenny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
had
moaned
in
her
sleep
and
moved
.
The
sound
of
the
*NL*
familiar
voice
seemed
to
calm
her
again
.
She
was
quiet
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
little
I
thought
,
when
I
raised
my
handkerchief
to
look
upon
the
*NL*
tiny
sleeper
underneath
and
seemed
to
see
a
halo
shine
around
the
*NL*
child
through
Ada
's
drooping
hair
as
her
pity
bent
her
head
--
how
*NL*
little
I
thought
in
whose
unquiet
bosom
that
handkerchief
would
come
*NL*
to
lie
after
covering
the
motionless
and
peaceful
breast
!
I
only
*NL*
thought
that
perhaps
the
Angel
of
the
child
might
not
be
all
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
woman
who
replaced
it
with
so
compassionate
a
*NL*
hand
;
not
all
unconscious
of
her
presently
,
when
we
had
taken
leave
,
*NL*
and
left
her
at
the
door
,
by
turns
looking
,
and
listening
in
terror
*NL*
for
herself
,
and
saying
in
her
old
soothing
manner
,
``
Jenny
,
Jenny
!

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Signs
and
Tokens
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
I
seem
to
be
always
writing
about
myself
.
I
*NL*
mean
all
the
time
to
write
about
other
people
,
and
I
try
to
think
*NL*
about
myself
as
little
as
possible
,
and
I
am
sure
,
when
I
find
myself
*NL*
coming
into
the
story
again
,
I
am
really
vexed
and
say
,
``
Dear
,
dear
,
*NL*
you
tiresome
little
creature
,
I
wish
you
would
n't
!
''
but
it
is
all
of
*NL*
no
use
.
I
hope
any
one
who
may
read
what
I
write
will
understand
that
*NL*
if
these
pages
contain
a
great
deal
about
me
,
I
can
only
suppose
it
*NL*
must
be
because
I
have
really
something
to
do
with
them
and
ca
n't
be
*NL*
kept
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
darling
and
I
read
together
,
and
worked
,
and
practised
,
and
found
*NL*
so
much
employment
for
our
time
that
the
winter
days
flew
by
us
like
*NL*
bright-winged
birds
.
Generally
in
the
afternoons
,
and
always
in
the
*NL*
evenings
,
Richard
gave
us
his
company
.
Although
he
was
one
of
the
*NL*
most
restless
creatures
in
the
world
,
he
certainly
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
our
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
,
very
,
very
fond
of
Ada
.
I
mean
it
,
and
I
had
better
say
*NL*
it
at
once
.
I
had
never
seen
any
young
people
falling
in
love
before
,
*NL*
but
I
found
them
out
quite
soon
.
I
could
not
say
so
,
of
course
,
or
*NL*
show
that
I
knew
anything
about
it
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
was
so
demure
*NL*
and
used
to
seem
so
unconscious
that
sometimes
I
considered
within
*NL*
myself
while
I
was
sitting
at
work
whether
I
was
not
growing
quite
*NL*
deceitful
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
help
for
it
.
All
I
had
to
do
was
to
be
quiet
,
and
I
*NL*
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
.
They
were
as
quiet
as
mice
too
,
so
far
as
*NL*
any
words
were
concerned
,
but
the
innocent
manner
in
which
they
*NL*
relied
more
and
more
upon
me
as
they
took
more
and
more
to
one
*NL*
another
was
so
charming
that
I
had
great
difficulty
in
not
showing
*NL*
how
it
interested
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
dear
little
old
woman
is
such
a
capital
old
woman
,
''
Richard
*NL*
would
say
,
coming
up
to
meet
me
in
the
garden
early
,
with
his
*NL*
pleasant
laugh
and
perhaps
the
least
tinge
of
a
blush
,
``
that
I
ca
n't
*NL*
get
on
without
her
.
Before
I
begin
my
harum-scarum
day
--
grinding
away
*NL*
at
those
books
and
instruments
and
then
galloping
up
hill
and
down
*NL*
dale
,
all
the
country
round
,
like
a
highwayman
--
it
does
me
so
much
*NL*
good
to
come
and
have
a
steady
walk
with
our
comfortable
friend
,
that
*NL*
here
I
am
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Dame
Durden
,
dear
,
''
Ada
would
say
at
night
,
with
her
head
*NL*
upon
my
shoulder
and
the
firelight
shining
in
her
thoughtful
eyes
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
talk
when
we
come
upstairs
here
.
Only
to
sit
a
little
*NL*
while
thinking
,
with
your
dear
face
for
company
,
and
to
hear
the
wind
*NL*
and
remember
the
poor
sailors
at
sea
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
Perhaps
Richard
was
going
to
be
a
sailor
.
We
had
talked
it
over
*NL*
very
often
now
,
and
there
was
some
talk
of
gratifying
the
inclination
*NL*
of
his
childhood
for
the
sea
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
written
to
a
relation
*NL*
of
the
family
,
a
great
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
for
his
interest
in
*NL*
Richard
's
favour
,
generally
;
and
Sir
Leicester
had
replied
in
a
*NL*
gracious
manner
that
he
would
be
happy
to
advance
the
prospects
of
*NL*
the
young
gentleman
if
it
should
ever
prove
to
be
within
his
power
,
*NL*
which
was
not
at
all
probable
,
and
that
my
Lady
sent
her
compliments
*NL*
to
the
young
gentleman
-LRB-
to
whom
she
perfectly
remembered
that
she
was
*NL*
allied
by
remote
consanguinity
-RRB-
and
trusted
that
he
would
ever
do
his
*NL*
duty
in
any
honourable
profession
to
which
he
might
devote
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
apprehend
it
's
pretty
clear
,
''
said
Richard
to
me
,
``
that
I
shall
*NL*
have
to
work
my
own
way
.
Never
mind
!
Plenty
of
people
have
had
to
do
*NL*
that
before
now
,
and
have
done
it
.
I
only
wish
I
had
the
command
of
a
*NL*
clipping
privateer
to
begin
with
and
could
carry
off
the
Chancellor
*NL*
and
keep
him
on
short
allowance
until
he
gave
judgment
in
our
cause
.
*NL*
He
'd
find
himself
growing
thin
,
if
he
did
n't
look
sharp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
buoyancy
and
hopefulness
and
a
gaiety
that
hardly
ever
*NL*
flagged
,
Richard
had
a
carelessness
in
his
character
that
quite
*NL*
perplexed
me
,
principally
because
he
mistook
it
,
in
such
a
very
odd
*NL*
way
,
for
prudence
.
It
entered
into
all
his
calculations
about
money
*NL*
in
a
singular
manner
which
I
do
n't
think
I
can
better
explain
than
by
*NL*
reverting
for
a
moment
to
our
loan
to
Mr.
Skimpole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
ascertained
the
amount
,
either
from
Mr.
Skimpole
*NL*
himself
or
from
Coavinses
,
and
had
placed
the
money
in
my
hands
with
*NL*
instructions
to
me
to
retain
my
own
part
of
it
and
hand
the
rest
to
*NL*
Richard
.
The
number
of
little
acts
of
thoughtless
expenditure
which
*NL*
Richard
justified
by
the
recovery
of
his
ten
pounds
,
and
the
number
*NL*
of
times
he
talked
to
me
as
if
he
had
saved
or
realized
that
amount
,
*NL*
would
form
a
sum
in
simple
addition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
prudent
Mother
Hubbard
,
why
not
?
''
he
said
to
me
when
he
wanted
,
*NL*
without
the
least
consideration
,
to
bestow
five
pounds
on
the
*NL*
brickmaker
.
``
I
made
ten
pounds
,
clear
,
out
of
Coavinses
'
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
that
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
got
rid
of
ten
pounds
which
I
was
quite
content
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
and
never
expected
to
see
any
more
.
You
do
n't
deny
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
Then
I
came
into
possession
of
ten
pounds
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
ten
pounds
,
''
I
hinted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
''
returned
Richard
.
``
I
have
got
ten
*NL*
pounds
more
than
I
expected
to
have
,
and
consequently
I
can
afford
to
*NL*
spend
it
without
being
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
exactly
the
same
way
,
when
he
was
persuaded
out
of
the
sacrifice
*NL*
of
these
five
pounds
by
being
convinced
that
it
would
do
no
good
,
he
*NL*
carried
that
sum
to
his
credit
and
drew
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
!
''
he
would
say
.
``
I
saved
five
pounds
out
of
the
*NL*
brickmaker
's
affair
,
so
if
I
have
a
good
rattle
to
London
and
back
in
*NL*
a
post-chaise
and
put
that
down
at
four
pounds
,
I
shall
have
saved
*NL*
one
.
And
it
's
a
very
good
thing
to
save
one
,
let
me
tell
you
:
a
penny
*NL*
saved
is
a
penny
got
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
Richard
's
was
as
frank
and
generous
a
nature
as
there
*NL*
possibly
can
be
.
He
was
ardent
and
brave
,
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
*NL*
wild
restlessness
,
was
so
gentle
that
I
knew
him
like
a
brother
in
a
*NL*
few
weeks
.
His
gentleness
was
natural
to
him
and
would
have
shown
*NL*
itself
abundantly
even
without
Ada
's
influence
;
but
with
it
,
he
*NL*
became
one
of
the
most
winning
of
companions
,
always
so
ready
to
be
*NL*
interested
and
always
so
happy
,
sanguine
,
and
light-hearted
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
that
I
,
sitting
with
them
,
and
walking
with
them
,
and
talking
*NL*
with
them
,
and
noticing
from
day
to
day
how
they
went
on
,
falling
*NL*
deeper
and
deeper
in
love
,
and
saying
nothing
about
it
,
and
each
*NL*
shyly
thinking
that
this
love
was
the
greatest
of
secrets
,
perhaps
*NL*
not
yet
suspected
even
by
the
other
--
I
am
sure
that
I
was
scarcely
*NL*
less
enchanted
than
they
were
and
scarcely
less
pleased
with
the
*NL*
pretty
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
going
on
in
this
way
,
when
one
morning
at
breakfast
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
received
a
letter
,
and
looking
at
the
superscription
,
said
,
*NL*
``
From
Boythorn
?
Aye
,
aye
!
''
and
opened
and
read
it
with
evident
*NL*
pleasure
,
announcing
to
us
in
a
parenthesis
when
he
was
about
*NL*
half-way
through
,
that
Boythorn
was
``
coming
down
''
on
a
visit
.
Now
who
*NL*
was
Boythorn
,
we
all
thought
.
And
I
dare
say
we
all
thought
too
--
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
did
,
for
one
--
would
Boythorn
at
all
interfere
with
what
was
*NL*
going
forward
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
school
with
this
fellow
,
Lawrence
Boythorn
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
tapping
the
letter
as
he
laid
it
on
the
table
,
``
more
than
*NL*
five
and
forty
years
ago
.
He
was
then
the
most
impetuous
boy
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
he
is
now
the
most
impetuous
man
.
He
was
then
the
loudest
*NL*
boy
in
the
world
,
and
he
is
now
the
loudest
man
.
He
was
then
the
*NL*
heartiest
and
sturdiest
boy
in
the
world
,
and
he
is
now
the
heartiest
*NL*
and
sturdiest
man
.
He
is
a
tremendous
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
stature
,
sir
?
''
asked
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
,
Rick
,
in
that
respect
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
;
``
being
some
*NL*
ten
years
older
than
I
and
a
couple
of
inches
taller
,
with
his
head
*NL*
thrown
back
like
an
old
soldier
,
his
stalwart
chest
squared
,
his
*NL*
hands
like
a
clean
blacksmith
's
,
and
his
lungs
!
There
's
no
simile
for
*NL*
his
lungs
.
Talking
,
laughing
,
or
snoring
,
they
make
the
beams
of
the
*NL*
house
shake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Jarndyce
sat
enjoying
the
image
of
his
friend
Boythorn
,
we
*NL*
observed
the
favourable
omen
that
there
was
not
the
least
indication
*NL*
of
any
change
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
the
inside
of
the
man
,
the
warm
heart
of
the
man
,
the
*NL*
passion
of
the
man
,
the
fresh
blood
of
the
man
,
Rick
--
and
Ada
,
and
*NL*
little
Cobweb
too
,
for
you
are
all
interested
in
a
visitor
--
that
I
*NL*
speak
of

''
he
pursued
.
``
His
language
is
as
sounding
as
his
voice
.
He
*NL*
is
always
in
extremes
,
perpetually
in
the
superlative
degree
.
In
his
*NL*
condemnation
he
is
all
ferocity
.
You
might
suppose
him
to
be
an
ogre
*NL*
from
what
he
says
,
and
I
believe
he
has
the
reputation
of
one
with
*NL*
some
people

There
!
I
tell
you
no
more
of
him
beforehand
.
You
must
*NL*
not
be
surprised
to
see
him
take
me
under
his
protection
,
for
he
has
*NL*
never
forgotten
that
I
was
a
low
boy
at
school
and
that
our
*NL*
friendship
began
in
his
knocking
two
of
my

's
teeth
out

six

before
breakfast

Boythorn

his
man

to
me
,
``
will
*NL*
be
here
this
afternoon

my
dear

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
care
that
the
necessary
preparations
were
made
for
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
's
reception
,
and
we
looked
forward
to
his
arrival
with
some
*NL*
curiosity
.
The
afternoon
wore
away
,
however
,
and
he
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
The
dinner-hour
arrived
,
and
still
he
did
not
appear
.
The
dinner
was
*NL*
put
back
an
hour
,
and
we
were
sitting
round
the
fire
with
no
light
*NL*
but
the
blaze
when
the
hall-door
suddenly
burst
open
and
the
hall
*NL*
resounded
with
these
words
,
uttered
with
the
greatest
vehemence
and
*NL*
in
a
stentorian
tone
:
``
We
have
been
misdirected
,
Jarndyce
,
by
a
most
*NL*
abandoned
ruffian
,
who
told
us
to
take
the
turning
to
the
right
*NL*
instead
of
to
the
left
.
He
is
the
most
intolerable
scoundrel
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
earth
.
His
father
must
have
been
a
most
consummate
*NL*
villain
,
ever
to
have
such
a
son
.
I
would
have
had
that
fellow
shot
*NL*
without
the
least
remorse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
do
it
on
purpose
?
''
Mr.
Jarndyce
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
scoundrel
has
passed
his
*NL*
whole
existence
in
misdirecting
travellers
!
''
returned
the
other
.
``
By
*NL*
my
soul
,
I
thought
him
the
worst-looking
dog
I
had
ever
beheld
when
*NL*
he
was
telling
me
to
take
the
turning
to
the
right
.
And
yet
I
stood
*NL*
before
that
fellow
face
to
face
and
did
n't
knock
his
brains
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teeth
,
you
mean
?
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
laughed
Mr.
Lawrence
Boythorn
,
really
making
the
whole
*NL*
house
vibrate
.
``
What
,
you
have
not
forgotten
it
yet
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
And
*NL*
that
was
another
most
consummate
vagabond
!
By
my
soul
,
the
*NL*
countenance
of
that
fellow
when
he
was
a
boy
was
the
blackest
image
*NL*
of
perfidy
,
cowardice
,
and
cruelty
ever
set
up
as
a
scarecrow
in
a
*NL*
field
of
scoundrels
.
If
I
were
to
meet
that
most
unparalleled
despot
*NL*
in
the
streets
to-morrow
,
I
would
fell
him
like
a
rotten
tree
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
Now
,
will
you
come
*NL*
upstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
soul
,
Jarndyce
,
''
returned
his
guest
,
who
seemed
to
refer
to
*NL*
his
watch
,
``
if
you
had
been
married
,
I
would
have
turned
back
at
the
*NL*
garden-gate
and
gone
away
to
the
remotest
summits
of
the
Himalaya
*NL*
Mountains
sooner
than
I
would
have
presented
myself
at
this
*NL*
unseasonable
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
so
far
,
I
hope
?
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
life
and
honour
,
yes
!
''
cried
the
visitor
.
``
I
would
n't
be
*NL*
guilty
of
the
audacious
insolence
of
keeping
a
lady
of
the
house
*NL*
waiting
all
this
time
for
any
earthly
consideration
.
I
would
*NL*
infinitely
rather
destroy
myself
--
infinitely
rather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Talking
thus
,
they
went
upstairs
,
and
presently
we
heard
him
in
his
*NL*
bedroom
thundering
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
and
again
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
until
the
*NL*
flattest
echo
in
the
neighbourhood
seemed
to
catch
the
contagion
and
*NL*
to
laugh
as
enjoyingly
as
he
did
or
as
we
did
when
we
heard
him
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
conceived
a
prepossession
in
his
favour
,
for
there
was
a
*NL*
sterling
quality
in
this
laugh
,
and
in
his
vigorous
,
healthy
voice
,
*NL*
and
in
the
roundness
and
fullness
with
which
he
uttered
every
word
he
*NL*
spoke
,
and
in
the
very
fury
of
his
superlatives
,
which
seemed
to
go
*NL*
off
like
blank
cannons
and
hurt
nothing
.
But
we
were
hardly
prepared
*NL*
to
have
it
so
confirmed
by
his
appearance
when
Mr.
Jarndyce
presented
*NL*
him
.
He
was
not
only
a
very
handsome
old
gentleman
--
upright
and
*NL*
stalwart
as
he
had
been
described
to
us
--
with
a
massive
grey
head
,
a
*NL*
fine
composure
of
face
when
silent
,
a
figure
that
might
have
become
*NL*
corpulent
but
for
his
being
so
continually
in
earnest
that
he
gave
it
*NL*
no
rest
,
and
a
chin
that
might
have
subsided
into
a
double
chin
but
*NL*
for
the
vehement
emphasis
in
which
it
was
constantly
required
to
*NL*
assist
;
but
he
was
such
a
true
gentleman
in
his
manner
,
so
*NL*
chivalrously
polite
,
his
face
was
lighted
by
a
smile
of
so
much
*NL*
sweetness
and
tenderness
,
and
it
seemed
so
plain
that
he
had
nothing
*NL*
to
hide
,
but
showed
himself
exactly
as
he
was
--
incapable
,
as
Richard
*NL*
said
,
of
anything
on
a
limited
scale
,
and
firing
away
with
those
*NL*
blank
great
guns
because
he
carried
no
small
arms
whatever
--
that
*NL*
really
I
could
not
help
looking
at
him
with
equal
pleasure
as
he
sat
*NL*
at
dinner
,
whether
he
smilingly
conversed
with
Ada
and
me
,
or
was
led
*NL*
by
Mr.
Jarndyce
into
some
great
volley
of
superlatives
,
or
threw
up
*NL*
his
head
like
a
bloodhound
and
gave
out
that
tremendous
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
brought
your
bird
with
you
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
heaven
,
he
is
the
most
astonishing
bird
in
Europe
!
''
replied
the
*NL*
other
.
``
He
IS
the
most
wonderful
creature
!
I
would
n't
take
ten
*NL*
thousand
guineas
for
that
bird
.
I
have
left
an
annuity
for
his
sole
*NL*
support
in
case
he
should
outlive
me
.
He
is
,
in
sense
and
attachment
,
*NL*
a
phenomenon
.
And
his
father
before
him
was
one
of
the
most
*NL*
astonishing
birds
that
ever
lived
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
this
laudation
was
a
very
little
canary
,
who
was
so
*NL*
tame
that
he
was
brought
down
by
Mr.
Boythorn
's
man
,
on
his
*NL*
forefinger
,
and
after
taking
a
gentle
flight
round
the
room
,
alighted
*NL*
on
his
master
's
head
.
To
hear
Mr.
Boythorn
presently
expressing
the
*NL*
most
implacable
and
passionate
sentiments
,
with
this
fragile
mite
of
*NL*
a
creature
quietly
perched
on
his
forehead
,
was
to
have
a
good
*NL*
illustration
of
his
character
,
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
soul
,
Jarndyce
,
''
he
said
,
very
gently
holding
up
a
bit
of
*NL*
bread
to
the
canary
to
peck
at
,
``
if
I
were
in
your
place
I
would
*NL*
seize
every
master
in
Chancery
by
the
throat
to-morrow
morning
and
*NL*
shake
him
until
his
money
rolled
out
of
his
pockets
and
his
bones
*NL*
rattled
in
his
skin
.
I
would
have
a
settlement
out
of
somebody
,
by
*NL*
fair
means
or
by
foul
.
If
you
would
empower
me
to
do
it
,
I
would
do
*NL*
it
for
you
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
!
''
-LRB-
All
this
time
the
very
*NL*
small
canary
was
eating
out
of
his
hand
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
Lawrence
,
but
the
suit
is
hardly
at
such
a
point
at
*NL*
present
,
''
returned
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
laughing
,
``
that
it
would
be
greatly
*NL*
advanced
even
by
the
legal
process
of
shaking
the
bench
and
the
whole
*NL*
bar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
was
such
an
infernal
cauldron
as
that
Chancery
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
earth
!
''
said
Mr.
Boythorn
.
``
Nothing
but
a
mine
below
it
*NL*
on
a
busy
day
in
term
time
,
with
all
its
records

rules
,
and
*NL*
precedents
collected
in
it
and
every
functionary
belonging
to
it
*NL*
also
,
high
and
low
,
upward
and
downward
,
from
its
son
the
*NL*
Accountant-General
to
its
father
the
Devil
,
and
the
whole
blown
to
*NL*
atoms
with
ten
thousand
hundredweight
of
gunpowder
,
would
reform
it
*NL*
in
the
least
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
not
to
laugh
at
the
energetic
gravity
with
which
he
*NL*
recommended
this
strong
measure
of
reform
.
When
we
laughed
,
he
threw
*NL*
up
his
head
and
shook
his
broad
chest
,
and
again
the
whole
country
*NL*
seemed
to
echo
to
his
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
It
had
not
the
least
effect
in
*NL*
disturbing
the
bird
,
whose
sense
of
security
was
complete
and
who
*NL*
hopped
about
the
table
with
its
quick
head
now
on
this
side
and
now
*NL*
on
that
,
turning
its
bright
sudden
eye
on
its
master
as
if
he
were
no
*NL*
more
than
another
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
and
your
neighbour
get
on
about
the
disputed
right

way

said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
You

yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

returned
Mr.
Boythorn
.
``
By

morally
impossible

*NL*
``

said
my

laughingly
*NL*
to
Ada

``

suggested
Richard

``

suddenly

another

To
hear

say
all

with
unimaginable
energy

one
might
have

thought
him
the
angriest

might

supposed

that

``

softened
in

``

passed
very

was
passionately
fond
of
music
,
*NL*
for
his
face
showed
it
--
that
I
asked
my
guardian
as
we
sat
at
the
*NL*
backgammon
board
whether
Mr.
Boythorn
had
ever
been
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
.
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
meant
to
be
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
find
out
that
?
''
he
returned
with
a
smile
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
guardian
,
''
I
explained
,
not
without
reddening
a
little
at
hazarding
*NL*
what
was
in
my
thoughts
,
``
there
is
something
so
tender
in
his
manner
,
*NL*
after
all
,
and
he
is
so
very
courtly
and
gentle
to
us
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
directed
his
eyes
to
where
he
was
sitting
as
I
have
just
*NL*
described
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
little
woman
,
''
he
answered
.
``
He
was
all
but
married
*NL*
once
.
Long
ago
.
And
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
the
lady
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
but
she
died
to
him
.
That
time
has
had
its
influence
on
all
his
*NL*
later
life
.
Would
you
suppose
him
to
have
a
head
and
a
heart
full
of
*NL*
romance
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
guardian
,
I
might
have
supposed
so
.
But
it
is
easy
to
say
*NL*
that
when
you
have
told
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
never
since
been
what
he
might
have
been
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
*NL*
``
and
now
you
see
him
in
his
age
with
no
one
near
him
but
his
servant
*NL*
and
his
little
yellow
friend
.
It
's
your
throw
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
,
from
my
guardian
's
manner
,
that
beyond
this
point
I
could
not
*NL*
pursue
the
subject
without
changing
the
wind
.
I
therefore
forbore
to
*NL*
ask
any
further
questions
.
I
was
interested
,
but
not
curious
.
I
*NL*
thought
a
little
while
about
this
old
love
story
in
the
night
,
when
I
*NL*
was
awakened
by
Mr.
Boythorn
's
lusty
snoring
;
and
I
tried
to
do
that
*NL*
very
difficult
thing
,
imagine
old
people
young
again
and
invested
*NL*
with
the
graces
of
youth
.
But
I
fell
asleep
before
I
had
succeeded
,
*NL*
and
dreamed
of
the
days
when
I
lived
in
my
godmother
's
house
.
I
am
*NL*
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
such
subjects
to
know
whether
it
is
*NL*
at
all
remarkable
that
I
almost
always
dreamed
of
that
period
of
my
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
morning
there
came
a
letter
from
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
to
*NL*
Mr.
Boythorn
informing
him
that
one
of
their
clerks
would
wait
upon
*NL*
him
at
noon
.
As
it
was
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
I
paid
the
bills
,
*NL*
and
added
up
my
books
,
and
made
all
the
household
affairs
as
compact
*NL*
as
possible
,
I
remained
at
home
while
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
Ada
,
and
Richard
*NL*
took
advantage
of
a
very
fine
day
to
make
a
little
excursion
,
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
was
to
wait
for
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
clerk
and
then
was
to
go
*NL*
on
foot
to
meet
them
on
their
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
!
I
was
full
of
business
,
examining
tradesmen
's
books
,
adding
up
*NL*
columns
,
paying
money
,
filing
receipts
,
and
I
dare
say
making
a
great
*NL*
bustle
about
it
when
Mr.
Guppy
was
announced
and
shown
in
.
I
had
had
*NL*
some
idea
that
the
clerk
who
was
to
be
sent
down
might
be
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
who
had
met
me
at
the
coach-office
,
and
I
was
glad
to
see
*NL*
him
,
because
he
was
associated
with
my
present
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
scarcely
knew
him
again
,
he
was
so
uncommonly
smart
.
He
had
an
*NL*
entirely
new
suit
of
glossy
clothes
on
,
a
shining
hat
,
lilac-kid
*NL*
gloves
,
a
neckerchief
of
a
variety
of
colours
,
a
large
hot-house
*NL*
flower
in
his
button-hole
,
and
a
thick
gold
ring
on
his
little
*NL*
finger
.
Besides
which
,
he
quite
scented
the
dining-room
with
*NL*
bear
's
-
grease
and
other
perfumery
.
He
looked
at
me
with
an
attention
*NL*
that
quite
confused
me
when
I
begged
him
to
take
a
seat
until
the
*NL*
servant
should
return
;
and
as
he
sat
there
crossing
and
uncrossing
*NL*
his
legs
in
a
corner
,
and
I
asked
him
if
he
had
had
a
pleasant
ride
,
*NL*
and
hoped
that
Mr.
Kenge
was
well
,
I
never
looked
at
him
,
but
I
found
*NL*
him
looking
at
me
in
the
same
scrutinizing
and
curious
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
request
was
brought
to
him
that
he
would
go
upstairs
to
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
's
room
,
I
mentioned
that
he
would
find
lunch
prepared
for
*NL*
him
when
he
came
down
,
of
which
Mr.
Jarndyce
hoped
he
would
partake
.
*NL*
He
said
with
some
embarrassment
,
holding
the
handle
of
the
door
,
*NL*
``
Shall
I
have
the
honour
of
finding
you
here
,
miss
?
''
I
replied
yes
,
I
*NL*
should
be
there
;
and
he
went
out
with
a
bow
and
another
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
him
only
awkward
and
shy
,
for
he
was
evidently
much
*NL*
embarrassed
;
and
I
fancied
that
the
best
thing
I
could
do
would
be
to
*NL*
wait
until
I
saw
that
he
had
everything
he
wanted
and
then
to
leave
*NL*
him
to
himself
.
The
lunch
was
soon
brought
,
but
it
remained
for
some
*NL*
time
on
the
table
.
The
interview
with
Mr.
Boythorn
was
a
long
one
,
*NL*
and
a
stormy
one
too
,
I
should
think
,
for
although
his
room
was
at
*NL*
some
distance
I
heard
his
loud
voice
rising
every
now
and
then
like
a
*NL*
high
wind
,
and
evidently
blowing
perfect
broadsides
of
denunciation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mr.
Guppy
came
back
,
looking
something
the
worse
for
the
*NL*
conference
.
``
My
eye
,
miss
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
``
he
's
a
Tartar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
take
some
refreshment
,
sir
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
nervously
sharpening
the
*NL*
carving-knife
on
the
carving-fork
,
still
looking
at
me
-LRB-
as
I
felt
*NL*
quite
sure
without
looking
at
him
-RRB-
in
the
same
unusual
manner
.
The
*NL*
sharpening
lasted
so
long
that
at
last
I
felt
a
kind
of
obligation
on
*NL*
me
to
raise
my
eyes
in
order
that
I
might
break
the
spell
under
which
*NL*
he
seemed
to
labour
,
of
not
being
able
to
leave
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
looked
at
the
dish
and
began
to
carve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
take
yourself
,
miss
?
You
'll
take
a
morsel
of
*NL*
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
I
give
you
a
piece
of
anything
at
all
,
miss
?
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
*NL*
hurriedly
drinking
off
a
glass
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
thank
you
,
''
said
I.
``
I
have
only
waited
to
see
that
you
*NL*
have
everything
you
want
.
Is
there
anything
I
can
order
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
miss
,
I
'm
sure
.
I
've
everything
that
I
*NL*
can
require
to
make
me
comfortable
--
at
least
I
--
not
comfortable
--
I
'm
*NL*
never
that
.
''
He
drank
off
two
more
glasses
of
wine
,
one
after
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
better
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
miss
!
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
rising
when
he
saw
me
*NL*
rise
.
``
But
would
you
allow
me
the
favour
of
a
minute
's
private
*NL*
conversation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
knowing
what
to
say
,
I
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
follows
is
without
prejudice
,
miss
?
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
anxiously
*NL*
bringing
a
chair
towards
my
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
mean
,
''
said
I
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
one
of
our
law
terms
,
miss
.
You
wo
n't
make
any
use
of
it
to
my
*NL*
detriment
at
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
or
elsewhere
.
If
our
conversation
*NL*
should
n't
lead
to
anything
,
I
am
to
be
as
I
was
and
am
not
to
be
*NL*
prejudiced
in
my
situation
or
worldly
prospects
.
In
short
,
it
's
in
*NL*
total
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
a
loss
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
imagine
what
you
can
have
to
*NL*
communicate
in
total
confidence
to
me
,
whom
you
have
never
seen
but
*NL*
once
;
but
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
do
you
any
injury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
miss
.
I
'm
sure
of
it
--
that
's
quite
sufficient
.
''
All
this
*NL*
time
Mr.
Guppy
was
either
planing
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
*NL*
or
tightly
rubbing
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
the
palm
of
his
*NL*
right
.
``
If
you
would
excuse
my
taking
another
glass
of
wine
,
miss
,
I
*NL*
think
it
might
assist
me
in
getting
on
without
a
continual
choke
that
*NL*
can
not
fail
to
be
mutually
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
so
,
and
came
back
again
.
I
took
the
opportunity
of
moving
well
*NL*
behind
my
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
allow
me
to
offer
you
one
,
would
you
miss
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Guppy
,
apparently
refreshed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
any
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
half
a
glass
?
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
Quarter
?
No
!
Then
,
to
proceed

*NL*
My
present
salary
,
Miss
Summerson
,
at
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
,
is
two
*NL*
pound
a
week
.
When
I
first
had
the
happiness
of
looking
upon
you
,
it
*NL*
was
one
fifteen
,
and
had
stood
at
that
figure
for
a
lengthened
*NL*
period
.
A
rise
of
five
has
since
taken
place
,
and
a
further
rise
of
*NL*
five
is
guaranteed
at
the
expiration
of
a
term
not
exceeding
twelve
*NL*
months
from
the
present
date
.
My
mother
has
a
little
property
,
which
*NL*
takes
the
form
of
a
small
life
annuity
,
upon
which
she
lives
in
an
*NL*
independent
though
unassuming
manner
in
the
Old
Street
Road
.
She
is
*NL*
eminently
calculated
for
a
mother-in-law
.
She
never
interferes
,
is
*NL*
all
for
peace
,
and
her
disposition
easy
.
She
has
her
failings
--
as
who
*NL*
has
not
?
--
but
I
never
knew
her
do
it
when
company
was
present
,
at
*NL*
which
time
you
may
freely
trust
her
with
wines
,
spirits
,
or
malt
*NL*
liquors

My
own
abode
is
lodgings
at
Penton
Place
,
Pentonville
.
It
is
*NL*
lowly
,
but
airy
,
open
at
the
back
,
and
considered
one
of
the
*NL*
`
ealthiest
outlets
.
Miss
Summerson
!
In
the
mildest
language
,
I
adore
*NL*
you
.
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
allow
me
-LRB-
as
I
may
say
-RRB-
to
file
a
*NL*
declaration
--
to
make
an
offer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
went
down
on
his
knees
.
I
was
well
behind
my
table
and
not
*NL*
much
frightened
.
I
said
,
``
Get
up
from
that
ridiculous
position
*NL*
immediately
,
sir
,
or
you
will
oblige
me
to
break
my

promise
*NL*
and
ring
the
bell
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear

out

said
Mr.

,
folding
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
consent

hear
another

I
returned
,
``
Unless

up
from

ought

you
have
any

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
piteously
,

slowly
rose
and
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
what
a
mockery
it
is

he
said
with
his
hand
upon
his
*NL*
heart
and
shaking
his
head
at
me
in
a
melancholy
manner
over
the
*NL*
tray
,
``
to
be
stationed
behind
food

such
a

recoils

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

``
As

Would

that
vow
before
the

shrine

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

quite
impossible

said
I
,
``

entirely
out
of

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Guppy
,
leaning
forward
over
the
tray
and
*NL*
regarding
me
,
as
I
again
strangely
felt
,
though
my
eyes
were
not
*NL*
directed
to
him
,
with
his
late
intent
look

But

Miss

No

been

I
told
him
that
he
addressed
my
interest
or
what
he
supposed
to
be
my
*NL*
interest
quite
as
unsuccessfully
as
he
addressed
my
inclination
,
and
*NL*
he
would
now
understand
that
I
requested
him
,
if
he
pleased
,
to
go
*NL*
away
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
miss
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
hear
but
another
word
!
I
think
you
*NL*
must
have
seen
that
I
was
struck
with
those
charms
on
the
day
when
I
*NL*
waited
at
the
Whytorseller
.
I
think
you
must
have
remarked
that
I
*NL*
could
not
forbear
a
tribute
to
those
charms
when
I
put
up
the
steps
*NL*
of
the
`
ackney-coach
.
It
was
a
feeble
tribute
to
thee
,
but
it
was
*NL*
well
meant
.
Thy
image
has
ever
since
been
fixed
in
my
breast
.
I
have
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
of
an
evening
opposite
Jellyby
's
house
only
to
*NL*
look
upon
the
bricks
that
once
contained
thee
.
This
out
of
to-day
,
*NL*
quite
an
unnecessary
out
so
far
as
the
attendance
,
which
was
its
*NL*
pretended
object
,
went
,
was
planned
by
me
alone
for
thee
alone
.
If
I
*NL*
speak
of
interest
,
it
is
only
to
recommend
myself
and
my
respectful
*NL*
wretchedness
.
Love
was
before
it
,
and
is
before
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
pained
,
Mr.
Guppy
,
''
said
I
,
rising
and
putting
my
hand
*NL*
upon
the
bell-rope
,
``
to
do
you
or
any
one
who
was
sincere
the
*NL*
injustice
of
slighting
any
honest
feeling
,
however
disagreeably
*NL*
expressed
.
If
you
have
really
meant
to
give
me
a
proof
of
your
good
*NL*
opinion
,
though
ill-timed
and
misplaced
,
I
feel
that
I
ought
to
thank
*NL*
you
.
I
have
very
little
reason
to
be
proud
,
and
I
am
not
proud
.
I
*NL*
hope
,
''
I
think
I
added
,
without
very
well
knowing
what
I
said
,
``
that
*NL*
you
will
now
go
away
as
if
you
had
never
been
so
exceedingly
foolish
*NL*
and
attend
to
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
a
minute
,
miss
!
''
cried
Mr.
Guppy
,
checking
me
as
I
was
about
to
*NL*
ring
.
``
This
has
been
without
prejudice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
mention
it
,
''
said
I
,
``
unless
you
should
give
me
future
*NL*
occasion
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarter
of
a
minute
,
miss
!
In
case
you
should
think
better
at
any
*NL*
time
,
however
distant
--
THAT
'S
no
consequence
,
for
my
feelings
can
*NL*
never
alter
--
of
anything
I
have
said
,
particularly
what
might
I
not
*NL*
do
,
Mr.
William
Guppy
,
eighty-seven

Penton
Place
,
or
if
removed
,
or
*NL*
dead
-LRB-

or
anything
of

sort
-RRB-
,
care
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Guppy
,
three
hundred
and
two

Old
Street
Road
,
will
be
sufficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rang
the
bell
,
the
servant
came
,
and
Mr.
Guppy
,
laying
his
written
*NL*
card
upon
the
table
and
making
a
dejected
bow
,
departed
.
Raising
my
*NL*
eyes
as
he
went
out
,
I
once
more
saw
him
looking
at
me
after
he
had
*NL*
passed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
there
for
another
hour
or
more
,
finishing
my
books
and
payments
*NL*
and
getting
through
plenty
of
business
.
Then
I
arranged
my
desk
,
and
*NL*
put
everything
away
,
and
was
so
composed
and
cheerful
that
I
thought
*NL*
I
had
quite
dismissed
this
unexpected
incident
.
But
,
when
I
went
*NL*
upstairs
to
my
own
room
,
I
surprised
myself
by
beginning
to
laugh
*NL*
about
it
and
then
surprised
myself
still
more
by
beginning
to
cry
*NL*
about
it
.
In
short
,
I
was
in
a
flutter
for
a
little
while
and
felt
as
*NL*
if
an
old
chord
had
been
more
coarsely
touched
than
it
ever
had
been
*NL*
since
the
days
of
the
dear
old
doll
,
long
buried
in
the
garden

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
The
Law-Writer
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eastern
borders
of
Chancery
Lane
,
that
is
to
say
,
more
*NL*
particularly
in
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
*NL*
law-stationer
,
pursues
his
lawful
calling
.
In
the
shade
of
Cook
's
*NL*
Court
,
at
most
times
a
shady
place
,
Mr.
Snagsby
has
dealt
in
*NL*
all
sorts
of
blank
forms
of
legal
process
;
in
skins
and
rolls
*NL*
of
parchment
;
in
paper
--
foolscap
,
brief
,
draft
,
brown
,
white
,
*NL*
whitey-brown
,
and
blotting
;
in
stamps
;
in
office-quills
,
pens
,
*NL*
ink
,
India-rubber
,
pounce
,
pins
,
pencils
,
sealing-wax
,
and
*NL*
wafers
;
in
red
tape
and
green
ferret
;
in
pocket-books
,
almanacs
,
*NL*
diaries
,
and
law
lists
;
in
string
boxes
,
rulers
,
inkstands
--
glass
*NL*
and
leaden
--
pen-knives
,
scissors
,
bodkins
,
and
other
small
*NL*
office-cutlery
;
in
short
,
in
articles
too
numerous
to
mention
,
ever
*NL*
since
he
was
out
of
his
time
and
went
into
partnership
with
Peffer
.
*NL*
On
that
occasion
,
Cook
's
Court
was
in
a
manner
revolutionized
by
the
*NL*
new
inscription
in
fresh
paint
,
PEFFER
AND
SNAGSBY
,
displacing
the
*NL*
time-honoured
and
not
easily
to
be
deciphered
legend
PEFFER
only
.
For
*NL*
smoke
,
which
is
the
London
ivy
,
had
so
wreathed
itself
round
Peffer
's
*NL*
name
and
clung
to
his
dwelling-place
that
the
affectionate
parasite
*NL*
quite
overpowered
the
parent
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peffer
is
never
seen
in
Cook
's
Court
now
.
He
is
not
expected
there
,
*NL*
for
he
has
been
recumbent
this
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
churchyard
*NL*
of
St.
Andrews
,
Holborn
,
with
the
waggons
and
hackney-coaches
roaring
*NL*
past
him
all
the
day
and
half
the
night
like
one
great
dragon
.
If
he
*NL*
ever
steal
forth
when
the
dragon
is
at
rest
to
air
himself
again
in
*NL*
Cook
's
Court
until
admonished
to
return
by
the
crowing
of
the
*NL*
sanguine
cock
in
the
cellar
at
the
little
dairy
in
Cursitor
Street
,
*NL*
whose
ideas
of
daylight
it
would
be
curious
to
ascertain
,
since
he
*NL*
knows
from
his
personal
observation
next
to
nothing
about
it
--
if
*NL*
Peffer
ever
do
revisit
the
pale
glimpses
of
Cook
's
Court
,
which
no
*NL*
law-stationer
in
the
trade
can
positively
deny
,
he
comes
invisibly
,
*NL*
and
no
one
is
the
worse
or
wiser
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
lifetime
,
and
likewise
in
the
period
of
Snagsby
's
``
time
''
*NL*
of
seven
long
years
,
there
dwelt
with
Peffer
in
the
same
*NL*
law-stationering
premises
a
niece
--
a
short
,
shrewd
niece
,
something
*NL*
too
violently
compressed
about
the
waist
,
and
with
a
sharp
nose
like
*NL*
a
sharp
autumn
evening
,
inclining
to
be
frosty
towards
the
end
.
The
*NL*
Cook
's
Courtiers
had
a
rumour
flying
among
them
that
the
mother
of
*NL*
this
niece
did
,
in
her
daughter
's
childhood
,
moved
by
too
jealous
a
*NL*
solicitude
that
her
figure
should
approach
perfection
,
lace
her
*NL*
up
every
morning
with
her
maternal
foot
against
the
bed-post
for
*NL*
a
stronger
hold
and
purchase
;
and
further
,
that
she
exhibited
*NL*
internally
pints
of
vinegar
and
lemon-juice
,
which
acids
,
they
held
,
*NL*
had
mounted
to
the
nose
and
temper
of
the
patient
.
With
whichsoever
*NL*
of
the
many
tongues
of
Rumour
this
frothy
report
originated
,
it
*NL*
either
never
reached
or
never
influenced
the
ears
of
young
Snagsby
,
*NL*
who
,
having
wooed
and
won
its
fair
subject
on
his
arrival
at
man
's
*NL*
estate
,
entered
into
two
partnerships
at
once
.
So
now
,
in
Cook
's
*NL*
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
,
Mr.
Snagsby
and
the
niece
are
one
;
and
the
*NL*
niece
still
cherishes
her
figure
,
which
,
however
tastes
may
differ
,
*NL*
is
unquestionably
so
far
precious
that
there
is
mighty
little
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
are
not
only
one
bone
and
one
flesh
,
but
,
to
the
*NL*
neighbours
'
thinking
,
one
voice
too
.
That
voice
,
appearing
to
proceed
*NL*
from
Mrs.
Snagsby
alone
,
is
heard
in
Cook
's
Court
very
often
.
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
,
otherwise
than
as
he
finds
expression
through
these
dulcet
*NL*
tones
,
is
rarely
heard
.
He
is
a
mild
,
bald
,
timid
man
with
a
shining
*NL*
head
and
a
scrubby
clump
of
black
hair
sticking
out
at
the
back
.
He
*NL*
tends
to
meekness
and
obesity
.
As
he
stands
at
his
door
in
Cook
's
*NL*
Court
in
his
grey
shop-coat
and
black
calico
sleeves
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
the
clouds
,
or
stands
behind
a
desk
in
his
dark
shop
with
a
heavy
*NL*
flat
ruler
,
snipping
and
slicing
at
sheepskin
in
company
with
his
two
*NL*
`
prentices
,
he
is
emphatically
a
retiring
and
unassuming
man
.
From
*NL*
beneath
his
feet
,
at
such
times
,
as
from
a
shrill
ghost
unquiet
in
*NL*
its
grave
,
there
frequently
arise
complainings
and
lamentations
in
*NL*
the
voice
already
mentioned
;
and
haply
,
on
some
occasions
when
these
*NL*
reach
a
sharper
pitch
than
usual
,
Mr.
Snagsby
mentions
to
the
*NL*
`
prentices
,
``
I
think
my
little
woman
is
a-giving
it
to
Guster
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
proper
name
,
so
used
by
Mr.
Snagsby
,
has
before
now
sharpened
*NL*
the
wit
of
the
Cook
's
Courtiers
to
remark
that
it
ought
to
be
the
*NL*
name
of
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
seeing
that
she
might
with
great
force
and
*NL*
expression
be
termed
a
Guster
,
in
compliment
to
her
stormy
character
.
*NL*
It
is
,
however
,
the
possession
,
and
the
only
possession
except
fifty
*NL*
shillings
per
annum
and
a
very
small
box
indifferently
filled
with
*NL*
clothing
,
of
a
lean
young
woman
from
a
workhouse
-LRB-
by
some
supposed
to
*NL*
have
been
christened
Augusta
-RRB-
who
,
although
she
was
farmed
or
*NL*
contracted
for
during
her
growing
time
by
an
amiable
benefactor
of
*NL*
his
species
resident
at
Tooting
,
and
can
not
fail
to
have
been
*NL*
developed
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
,
``
has
fits
,
''
which
*NL*
the
parish
ca
n't
account
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guster
,
really
aged
three
or
four
and
twenty
,
but
looking
a
round
ten
*NL*
years
older
,
goes
cheap
with
this
unaccountable
drawback
of
fits
,
and
*NL*
is
so
apprehensive
of
being
returned
on
the
hands
of
her
patron
saint
*NL*
that
except
when
she
is
found
with
her
head
in
the
pail
,
or
the
sink
,
*NL*
or
the
copper
,
or
the
dinner
,
or
anything
else
that
happens
to
be
*NL*
near
her
at
the
time
of
her
seizure
,
she
is
always
at
work
.
She
is
a
*NL*
satisfaction
to
the
parents
and
guardians
of
the
`
prentices
,
who
feel
*NL*
that
there
is
little
danger
of
her
inspiring
tender
emotions
in
the
*NL*
breast
of
youth
;
she
is
a
satisfaction
to
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
who
can
*NL*
always
find
fault
with
her
;
she
is
a
satisfaction
to
Mr.
Snagsby
,
who
*NL*
thinks
it
a
charity
to
keep
her
.
The
law-stationer
's
establishment
*NL*
is
,
in
Guster
's
eyes
,
a
temple
of
plenty
and
splendour
.
She
believes
*NL*
the
little
drawing-room
upstairs
,
always
kept
,
as
one
may
say
,
with
*NL*
its
hair
in
papers
and
its
pinafore
on
,
to
be
the
most
elegant
*NL*
apartment
in
Christendom
.
The
view
it
commands
of
Cook
's
Court
at
one
*NL*
end
-LRB-
not
to
mention
a
squint
into
Cursitor
Street
-RRB-
and
of
Coavinses
'
*NL*
the
sheriff
's
officer
's
backyard
at
the
other
she
regards
as
a
*NL*
prospect
of
unequalled
beauty
.
The
portraits
it
displays
in
oil
--
and
*NL*
plenty
of
it
too
--
of
Mr.
Snagsby
looking
at
Mrs.
Snagsby
and
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
looking
at
Mr.
Snagsby
are
in
her
eyes
as
achievements
of
*NL*
Raphael
or
Titian
.
Guster
has
some
recompenses
for
her
many
*NL*
privations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
refers
everything
not
in
the
practical
mysteries
of
the
*NL*
business
to
Mrs.
Snagsby
.
She
manages
the
money
,
reproaches
the
*NL*
tax-gatherers
,
appoints
the
times
and
places
of
devotion
on
Sundays
,
*NL*
licenses
Mr.
Snagsby
's
entertainments
,
and
acknowledges
no
*NL*
responsibility
as
to
what
she
thinks
fit
to
provide
for
dinner
,
*NL*
insomuch
that
she
is
the
high
standard
of
comparison
among
the
*NL*
neighbouring
wives
a
long
way
down
Chancery
Lane
on
both
sides
,
and
*NL*
even
out
in
Holborn
,
who
in
any
domestic
passages
of
arms
habitually
*NL*
call
upon
their
husbands
to
look
at
the
difference
between
their
-LRB-
the
*NL*
wives
'
-RRB-
position
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
's
,
and
their
-LRB-
the
husbands
'
-RRB-
*NL*
behaviour
and
Mr.
Snagsby
's
.
Rumour
,
always
flying
bat-like
about
*NL*
Cook
's
Court
and
skimming
in
and
out
at
everybody
's
windows
,
does
say
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Snagsby
is
jealous
and
inquisitive
and
that
Mr.
Snagsby
is
*NL*
sometimes
worried
out
of
house
and
home
,
and
that
if
he
had
the
*NL*
spirit
of
a
mouse
he
would
n't
stand
it
.
It
is
even
observed
that
the
*NL*
wives
who
quote
him
to
their
self-willed
husbands
as
a
shining
*NL*
example
in
reality
look
down
upon
him
and
that
nobody
does
so
with
*NL*
greater
superciliousness
than
one
particular
lady
whose
lord
is
more
*NL*
than
suspected
of
laying
his
umbrella
on
her
as
an
instrument
of
*NL*
correction
.
But
these
vague
whisperings
may
arise
from
Mr.
Snagsby
's
*NL*
being
in
his
way
rather
a
meditative
and
poetical
man
,
loving
to
walk
*NL*
in
Staple
Inn
in
the
summer-time
and
to
observe
how
countrified
the
*NL*
sparrows
and
the
leaves
are
,
also
to
lounge
about
the
Rolls
Yard
of
a
*NL*
Sunday
afternoon
and
to
remark
-LRB-
if
in
good

there
were

old
times
once

that
you
'd
find
a
stone
coffin
or
two
now
under
*NL*
that
chapel
,
he
'll
be
bound
,
if
you
was
to
dig
for
it
.
He
solaces
his
*NL*
imagination
,
too
,
by
thinking
of
the
many
Chancellors
and
Vices
,
and
*NL*
Masters
of
the
Rolls
who
are
deceased
;
and
he
gets
such
a
flavour
of
*NL*
the
country
out
of
telling
the
two
`
prentices
how
he
HAS
heard
say
*NL*
that
a
brook
``
as
clear
as
crystial
''
once
ran
right
down
the
middle
of
*NL*
Holborn
,
when
Turnstile
really
was
a
turnstile
,
leading
slap
away
*NL*
into
the
meadows
--
gets
such
a
flavour
of
the
country
out
of
this
that
*NL*
he
never
wants
to
go
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
is
closing
in
and
the
gas
is
lighted
,
but
is
not
yet
fully
*NL*
effective
,
for
it
is
not
quite
dark
.
Mr.
Snagsby
standing
at
his
*NL*
shop-door
looking
up
at
the
clouds
sees
a
crow
who
is
out
late
skim
*NL*
westward
over
the
slice
of
sky
belonging
to
Cook
's
Court
.
The
crow
*NL*
flies
straight
across
Chancery
Lane
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
Garden
into
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
in
a
large
house
,
formerly
a
house
of
state
,
lives
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
.
It
is
let
off
in
sets
of
chambers
now
,
and
in
those
*NL*
shrunken
fragments
of
its
greatness
,
lawyers
lie
like
maggots
in
*NL*
nuts
.
But
its
roomy
staircases
,
passages
,
and
antechambers
still
*NL*
remain
;
and
even
its
painted
ceilings
,
where
Allegory
,
in
Roman
*NL*
helmet
and
celestial
linen
,
sprawls
among
balustrades
and
pillars
,
*NL*
flowers
,
clouds
,
and
big-legged
boys
,
and
makes
the
head
ache
--
as
*NL*
would
seem
to
be
Allegory
's
object
always
,
more
or
less
.
Here
,
among
*NL*
his
many
boxes
labelled
with
transcendent
names
,
lives
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
,
when
not
speechlessly
at
home
in
country-houses
where
*NL*
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
are
bored
to
death
.
Here
he
is
to-day
,
*NL*
quiet
at
his
table
.
An
oyster
of
the
old
school
whom
nobody
can
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
as
he
is
to
look
at
,
so
is
his
apartment
in
the
dusk
of
*NL*
the
present
afternoon
.
Rusty
,
out
of
date
,
withdrawing
from
*NL*
attention
,
able
to
afford
it
.
Heavy
,
broad-backed
,
old-fashioned
,
*NL*
mahogany-and-horsehair
chairs
,
not
easily
lifted
;
obsolete
tables
*NL*
with
spindle-legs
and
dusty
baize
covers
;
presentation
prints
of
the
*NL*
holders
of
great
titles
in
the
last
generation
or
the
last
but
one
,
*NL*
environ
him
.
A
thick
and
dingy
Turkey-carpet
muffles
the
floor
where
*NL*
he
sits
,
attended
by
two
candles
in
old-fashioned
silver
candlesticks
*NL*
that
give
a
very
insufficient
light
to
his
large
room
.
The
titles
on
*NL*
the
backs
of
his
books
have
retired
into
the
binding
;
everything
that
*NL*
can
have
a
lock
has
got
one
;
no
key
is
visible
.
Very
few
loose
papers
*NL*
are
about
.
He
has
some
manuscript
near
him
,
but
is
not
referring
*NL*
to
it
.
With
the
round
top
of
an
inkstand
and
two
broken
bits
of
*NL*
sealing-wax
he
is
silently
and
slowly
working
out
whatever
train
of
*NL*
indecision
is
in
his
mind
.
Now
the
inkstand
top
is
in
the
middle
,
now
*NL*
the
red
bit
of
sealing-wax
,
now
the
black
bit
.
That
's
not
it
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
must
gather
them
all
up
and
begin
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
beneath
the
painted
ceiling
,
with
foreshortened
Allegory
*NL*
staring
down
at
his
intrusion
as
if
it
meant
to
swoop
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
he
cutting
it
dead
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
has
at
once
his
house
and
office
.
*NL*
He
keeps
no
staff
,
only
one
middle-aged
man
,
usually
a
little
out
at
*NL*
elbows
,
who
sits
in
a
high
pew
in
the
hall
and
is
rarely
overburdened
*NL*
with
business
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
not
in
a
common
way
.
He
wants
no
*NL*
clerks
.
He
is
a
great
reservoir
of
confidences
,
not
to
be
so
tapped
.
*NL*
His
clients
want
HIM
;
he
is
all
in
all
.
Drafts
that
he
requires
to
be
*NL*
drawn
are
drawn
by
special-pleaders
in
the
temple
on
mysterious
*NL*
instructions
;
fair
copies
that
he
requires
to
be
made
are
made
at
the
*NL*
stationers
'
,
expense
being
no
consideration
.
The
middle-aged
man
in
*NL*
the
pew
knows
scarcely
more
of
the
affairs
of
the
peerage
than
any
*NL*
crossing-sweeper
in
Holborn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
bit
,
the
black
bit
,
the
inkstand
top
,
the
other
inkstand
top
,
*NL*
the
little
sand-box
.
So
!
You
to
the
middle
,
you
to
the
right
,
you
to
*NL*
the
left
.
This
train
of
indecision
must
surely
be
worked
out
now
or
*NL*
never
.
Now
!
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
gets
up
,
adjusts
his
spectacles
,
puts
on
*NL*
his
hat
,
puts
the
manuscript
in
his
pocket
,
goes
out
,
tells
the
*NL*
middle-aged
man
out
at
elbows
,
``
I
shall
be
back
presently
.
''
Very
*NL*
rarely
tells
him
anything
more
explicit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
goes
,
as
the
crow
came
--
not
quite
so
straight
,
but
*NL*
nearly
--
to
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
.
To

*NL*
It
is
somewhere
about
five
or
six
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
a
*NL*
balmy
fragrance
of
warm
tea
hovers
in
Cook
's
Court
.
It
hovers
about
*NL*
Snagsby
's
door
.
The
hours
are
early
there
:
dinner
at
half-past
one
*NL*
and
supper
at
half-past
nine
.
Mr.
Snagsby
was
about
to
descend
into
*NL*
the
subterranean
regions
to
take
tea
when
he
looked
out
of
his
door
*NL*
just
now
and
saw
the
crow
who
was
out
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master

*NL*
*NL*
Guster
is
minding
the
shop

for
the

prentices

tea
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
;
consequently
,
the
robe-maker
's
two
*NL*
daughters
,
combing
their
curls
at
the
two
glasses
in
the
two
*NL*
second-floor
windows
of
the
opposite
house
,
are
not
driving
the
two
*NL*
`
prentices
to
distraction
as
they
fondly
suppose
,
but
are
merely
*NL*
awakening
the
unprofitable
admiration
of
Guster
,
whose
hair
wo
n't
*NL*
grow
,
and
never
would
,
and
it
is
confidently
thought
,
never
will

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
is
at

,
and
Guster
will
fetch
him

Guster
disappears
,
glad
*NL*
to
get
out
of
the
shop
,
which
she
regards
with
mingled
dread
and
*NL*
veneration
as
a
storehouse
of
awful
implements
of
the
great
torture
*NL*
of
the
law
--
a
place
not
to
be
entered
after
the
gas
is
turned
off

*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
appears

greasy
,
warm
,
herbaceous
,
and
chewing

Bolts
a
*NL*
bit
of
bread

Says

Snagsby
has
*NL*
brightened
in
a

The

strong
of

Mr.
Snagsby
turns
up
the

and
coughs
behind
his
hand
,
*NL*
modestly
anticipating
profit

Mr.
Snagsby
,
as
a
timid

accustomed

a
variety
of

taking

laying

on

separating
all

at

with
a
twirl

a

twist

the

Snagsby
,
*NL*
walking
deferentially
in
the
road
and
leaving
the
narrow
pavement
to
*NL*
the
lawyer
;
``
and
the
party
is
very
rough
.
But
they
're
a
wild
lot
in
*NL*
general
,
sir
.
The
advantage
of
this
particular
man
is
that
he
never
*NL*
wants
sleep
.
He
'll
go
at
it
right
on
end
if
you
want
him
to

as
long
*NL*
as
ever
you
like

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
quite
dark
now
,
and
the
gas-lamps
have
acquired
their
full
*NL*
effect
.
Jostling
against
clerks
going
to
post
the
day
's
letters
,
and
*NL*
against
counsel
and
attorneys
going
home
to
dinner
,
and
against
*NL*
plaintiffs
and
defendants
and
suitors
of
all
sorts

and
against
the
*NL*
general
crowd
,
in
whose
way
the
forensic
wisdom
of
ages
has
*NL*
interposed
a
million
of
obstacles
to
the
transaction
of
the
commonest
*NL*
business
of
life
;
diving
through
law

equity
,
and
through
that
*NL*
kindred
mystery
,
the
street
mud
,
which
is
made
of
nobody

what
*NL*
and
collects
about
us
nobody

whence

we
only
knowing
in

general
that
when
there
is
too
much
of
it
we
find
it
necessary
to

shovel
it
away

the
lawyer
and
the
law-stationer
come
to
a
rag
and
*NL*
bottle
shop
and
general
emporium
of
much
disregarded
merchandise
,
*NL*
lying
and
being
in

shadow

kept

Mr.
Snagsby
lifts
his
hat
and
returns
to
his
*NL*
little
woman
and
his
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
does
not
go
on
to
the
Fields
at
present
.
He
goes
*NL*
a
short
way
,
turns
back
,
comes
again
to
the
shop
of
Mr.
Krook
,
and
*NL*
enters
it
straight
.
It
is
dim
enough
,
with
a
blot-headed
candle
or
so
*NL*
in
the
windows
,
and
an
old
man
and
a
cat
sitting
in
the
back
part
by
*NL*
a
fire
.
The
old
man
rises
and
comes
forward
,
with
another
blot-headed
*NL*
candle
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray

your

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

has
eyed
his
man
narrowly

Knows
him
by
sight

Has
an

indistinct
impression

his
aristocratic
repute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

what

says
Mr.
Krook
with
a
grin
.
``
Shall
I
*NL*
call

down

But
it

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
up

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Second
floor

Take
the

Up
there

''
Mr.
Krook
,
with
his
*NL*
cat
beside
him
,
stands
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
looking
after
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
``
Hi-hi
!
''
he
says
when
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
has
nearly
*NL*
disappeared
.
The
lawyer
looks
down
over
the
hand-rail
.
The
cat
*NL*
expands
her
wicked
mouth
and
snarls
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Order

Lady
Jane

Behave
yourself

my

You

whispers
Krook
,
going
up
a
step
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
they

*NL*
*NL*
``
They

sold

better

I
'll
tell
you
what

my

is
so
*NL*
black-humoured
and
gloomy
that
I
believe
he
'd
as
soon
make
that
*NL*
bargain
as
any
other
.
Do
n't
put
him
out
,
sir
.
That
's
my
advice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
with
a
nod
goes
on
his
way
.
He
comes
to
the
dark
door
*NL*
on
the
second
floor
.
He
knocks
,
receives
no
answer
,
opens
it
,
and
*NL*
accidentally
extinguishes
his
candle
in
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
of
the
room
is
almost
bad
enough
to
have
extinguished
it
if
*NL*
he
had
not
.
It
is
a
small
room
,
nearly
black
with
soot
,
and
grease
,
*NL*
and
dirt
.
In
the
rusty
skeleton
of
a
grate
,
pinched
at
the
middle
as
*NL*
if
poverty
had
gripped
it
,
a
red
coke
fire
burns
low
.
In
the
corner
*NL*
by
the
chimney
stand
a
deal
table
and
a
broken
desk
,
a
wilderness
*NL*
marked
with
a
rain
of
ink
.
In
another
corner
a
ragged
old
portmanteau
*NL*
on
one
of
the
two
chairs
serves
for
cabinet
or
wardrobe
;
no
larger
*NL*
one
is
needed
,
for
it
collapses
like
the
cheeks
of
a
starved
man
.
The
*NL*
floor
is
bare
,
except
that
one
old
mat
,
trodden
to
shreds
of
*NL*
rope-yarn
,
lies
perishing
upon
the
hearth
.
No
curtain
veils
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
night
,
but
the
discoloured
shutters
are
drawn
*NL*
together
,
and
through
the
two
gaunt
holes
pierced
in
them
,
famine
*NL*
might
be
staring
in
--
the
banshee
of
the
man
upon
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
on
a
low
bed
opposite
the
fire
,
a
confusion
of
dirty
patchwork
,
*NL*
lean-ribbed
ticking
,
and
coarse
sacking
,
the
lawyer
,
hesitating
just
*NL*
within
the
doorway
,
sees
a
man
.
He
lies
there
,
dressed
in
shirt
and
*NL*
trousers
,
with
bare
feet
.
He
has
a
yellow
look
in
the
spectral
*NL*
darkness
of
a
candle
that
has
guttered
down
until
the
whole
length
of
*NL*
its
wick
-LRB-
still
burning
-RRB-
has
doubled
over
and
left
a
tower
of
*NL*
winding-sheet
above
it
.
His
hair
is
ragged
,
mingling
with
his
*NL*
whiskers
and
his
beard
--
the
latter
,
ragged
too
,
and
grown
,
like
the
*NL*
scum
and
mist
around
him
,
in
neglect
.
Foul
and
filthy
as
the
room
is
,
*NL*
foul
and
filthy
as
the
air
is
,
it
is
not
easy
to
perceive
what
fumes
*NL*
those
are
which
most
oppress
the
senses
in
it
;
but
through
the
*NL*
general
sickliness
and
faintness
,
and
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
,
*NL*
there
comes
into
the
lawyer
's
mouth
the
bitter
,
vapid
taste
of
opium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
my
friend
!
''
he
cries
,
and
strikes
his
iron
candlestick
*NL*
against
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thinks
he
has
awakened
his
friend
.
He
lies
a
little
turned
away
,
*NL*
but
his
eyes
are
surely
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
my
friend
!
''
he
cries
again
.
``
Hallo
!
Hallo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
rattles
on
the
door
,
the
candle
which
has
drooped
so
long
goes
*NL*
out
and
leaves
him
in
the
dark
,
with
the
gaunt
eyes
in
the
shutters
*NL*
staring
down
upon
the
bed
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Our
Dear
Brother
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
touch
on
the
lawyer
's
wrinkled
hand
as
he
stands
in
the
dark
room
,
*NL*
irresolute
,
makes
him
start
and
say
,
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
me
,
''
returns
the
old
man
of
the
house
,
whose
breath
is
in
his
*NL*
ear
.
``
Ca
n't
you
wake
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
with
your
candle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
gone
out
.
Here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Krook
takes
it
,
goes
to
the
fire
,
stoops
over
the
red
embers
,
and
*NL*
tries
to
get
a
light
.
The
dying
ashes
have
no
light
to
spare
,
and
his
*NL*
endeavours
are
vain
.
Muttering
,
after
an
ineffectual
call
to
his
*NL*
lodger
,
that
he
will
go
downstairs
and
bring
a
lighted
candle
from
*NL*
the
shop
,
the
old
man
departs
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
for
some
new
reason
*NL*
that
he
has
,
does
not
await
his
return
in
the
room
,
but
on
the
stairs
*NL*
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
welcome
light
soon
shines
upon
the
wall
,
as
Krook
comes
slowly
up
*NL*
with
his
green-eyed
cat
following
at
his
heels
.
``
Does
the
man
*NL*
generally
sleep
like
this
?
''
inquired
the
lawyer
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Hi
!
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
,
''
says
Krook
,
shaking
his
head
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
.
*NL*
``
I
know
next
to
nothing
of
his
habits
except
that
he
keeps
himself
*NL*
very
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
whispering
,
they
both
go
in
together
.
As
the
light
goes
in
,
the
*NL*
great
eyes
in
the
shutters
,
darkening
,
seem
to
close
.
Not
so
the
eyes
*NL*
upon
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
save
us
!
''
exclaims
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
``
He
is
dead
!
''
Krook
drops
*NL*
the
heavy
hand
he
has
taken
up
so
suddenly
that
the
arm
swings
over
*NL*
the
bedside
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
look
at
one
another
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
for
some
doctor
!
Call
for
Miss
Flite
up
the
stairs
,
sir
.
Here
's
*NL*
poison
by
the
bed
!
Call
out
for
Flite
,
will
you
?
''
says
Krook
,
with
*NL*
his
lean
hands
spread
out
above
the
body
like
a
vampire
's
wings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
hurries
to
the
landing
and
calls
,
``
Miss
Flite
!
Flite
!
*NL*
Make
haste
,
here
,
whoever
you
are
!
Flite
!
''
Krook
follows
him
with
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
while
he
is
calling
,
finds
opportunity
to
steal
to
the
old
*NL*
portmanteau
and
steal
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
,
Flite
,
run
!
The
nearest
doctor
!
Run
!
''
So
Mr.
Krook
addresses
a
*NL*
crazy
little
woman
who
is
his
female
lodger
,
who
appears
and
vanishes
*NL*
in
a
breath
,
who
soon
returns
accompanied
by
a
testy
medical
man
*NL*
brought
from
his
dinner
,
with
a
broad
,
snuffy
upper
lip
and
a
broad
*NL*
Scotch
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ey
!
Bless
the
hearts
o
'
ye
,
''
says
the
medical
man
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
them
after
a
moment
's
examination
.
``
He
's
just
as
dead
as
Phairy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
-LRB-
standing
by
the
old
portmanteau
-RRB-
inquires
if
he
has
*NL*
been
dead
any
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
time
,
sir
?
''
says
the
medical
gentleman
.
``
It
's
probable
he
wull
*NL*
have
been
dead
aboot
three
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
that
time
,
I
should
say
,
''
observes
a
dark
young
man
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Air
you
in
the
maydickle
prayfession
yourself
,
sir
?
''
inquires
the
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dark
young
man
says
yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
just
tak
'
my
depairture
,
''
replies
the
other
,
``
for
I
'm
nae
*NL*
gude
here
!
''
With
which
remark
he
finishes
his
brief
attendance
and
*NL*
returns
to
finish
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dark
young
surgeon
passes
the
candle
across
and
across
the
face
*NL*
and
carefully
examines
the
law-writer
,
who
has
established
his
*NL*
pretensions
to
his
name
by
becoming
indeed
No
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
this
person
by
sight
very
well
,
''
says
he
.
``
He
has
purchased
*NL*
opium
of
me
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
.
Was
anybody
present
related
*NL*
to
him
?
''
glancing
round
upon
the
three
bystanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
his
landlord
,
''
grimly
answers
Krook
,
taking
the
candle
from
*NL*
the
surgeon
's
outstretched
hand
.
``
He
told
me
once
I
was
the
nearest
*NL*
relation
he
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
died
,
''
says
the
surgeon
,
``
of
an
over-dose
of
opium
,
there
is
*NL*
no
doubt
.
The
room
is
strongly
flavoured
with
it
.
There
is
enough
*NL*
here
now
,
''
taking
an
old
tea-pot
from
Mr.
Krook
,
``
to
kill
a
dozen
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
?
''
asks
Krook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Took
the
over-dose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
Krook
almost
smacks
his
lips
with
the
unction
of
a
horrible
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
.
I
should
think
it
unlikely
,
as
he
has
been
in
the
habit
*NL*
of
taking
so
much
.
But
nobody
can
tell
.
He
was
very
poor
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
was
.
His
room
--
do
n't
look
rich
,
''
says
Krook
,
who
might
*NL*
have
changed
eyes
with
his
cat
,
as
he
casts
his
sharp
glance
around
.
*NL*
``
But
I
have
never
been
in
it
since
he
had
it
,
and
he
was
too
close
to
*NL*
name
his
circumstances
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
owe
you
any
rent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
never
pay
it
!
''
says
the
young
man
,
resuming
his
examination
.
*NL*
``
It
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
is
indeed
as
dead
as
Pharaoh
;
and
to
*NL*
judge
from
his
appearance
and
condition
,
I
should
think
it
a
happy
*NL*
release

Yet
he
must
have
been
a
good
figure
when
a
youth
,
and
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
good-looking
.
''
He
says
this
,
not
unfeelingly
,
while
sitting
on
*NL*
the
bedstead
's
edge
with
his
face
towards
that
other
face
and
his
*NL*
hand
upon
the
region
of
the
heart
.
``
I
recollect
once
thinking
there
*NL*
was
something
in
his
manner
,
uncouth
as
it
was
,
that
denoted
a
fall
*NL*
in
life
.
Was
that
so
?
''
he
continues
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Krook
replies
,
``
You
might
as
well
ask
me
to
describe
the
ladies
whose
*NL*
heads
of
hair
I
have
got
in
sacks
downstairs
.
Than
that
he
was
my
*NL*
lodger
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
lived
--
or
did
n't
live
--
by
*NL*
law-writing
,
I
know
no
more
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
dialogue
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
has
stood
aloof
by
the
old
*NL*
portmanteau
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
equally
removed
,
to
all
*NL*
appearance
,
from
all
three
kinds
of
interest
exhibited
near
the
*NL*
bed
--
from
the
young
surgeon
's
professional
interest
in
death
,
*NL*
noticeable
as
being
quite
apart
from
his
remarks
on
the
deceased
as
*NL*
an
individual
;
from
the
old
man
's
unction
;
and
the
little
crazy
*NL*
woman
's
awe
.
His
imperturbable
face
has
been
as
inexpressive
as
his
*NL*
rusty
clothes
.
One
could
not
even
say
he
has
been
thinking
all
this
*NL*
while
.
He
has
shown
neither
patience
nor
impatience
,
nor
attention
*NL*
nor
abstraction
.
He
has
shown
nothing
but
his
shell
.
As
easily
might
*NL*
the
tone
of
a
delicate
musical
instrument
be
inferred
from
its
case
,
*NL*
as
the
tone
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
from
his
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
interposes
,
addressing
the
young
surgeon
in
his
unmoved
,
*NL*
professional
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
looked
in
here
,
''
he
observes
,
``
just
before
you
,
with
the
*NL*
intention
of
giving
this
deceased
man
,
whom
I
never
saw
alive
,
some
*NL*
employment
at
his
trade
of
copying
.
I
had
heard
of
him
from
my
*NL*
stationer
--
Snagsby
of
Cook
's
Court
.
Since
no
one
here
knows
anything
*NL*
about
him
,
it
might
be
as
well
to
send
for
Snagsby
.
Ah
!
''
to
the
*NL*
little
crazy
woman
,
who
has
often
seen
him
in
court
,
and
whom
he
has
*NL*
often
seen
,
and
who
proposes
,
in
frightened
dumb-show
,
to
go
for
the
*NL*
law-stationer
.
``
Suppose
you
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
is
gone
,
the
surgeon
abandons
his
hopeless
investigation
*NL*
and
covers
its
subject
with
the
patchwork
counterpane
.
Mr.
Krook
and
*NL*
he
interchange
a
word
or
two
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
says
nothing
,
but
*NL*
stands
,
ever
,
near
the
old
portmanteau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
arrives
hastily
in
his
grey
coat
and
his
black
sleeves
.
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
dear
me

''
he
says
;
``

it
has
come

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you

unfortunate

inquires
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

says
Mr.

,
coughing
his
apologetic
cough
behind

his
hand

offer

*NL*
``
No

with

Mr.

prefacing
his

his

propitiation

out

A
pause

Mr.

looking
at
the
law-stationer

Mr.

,

with

open

looking

About
a

of

Mr.

I
name
Mrs.

when
I
use
that

*NL*
in
our
shop

produced
a
specimen
of
his
handwriting
and
gave
her
to
*NL*
understand
that
he
was
in
want
of
copying
work
to
do
and
was

not
to

put

fine
a
point
upon

a
favourite
apology
for
plain
speaking
*NL*
with
Mr.

,
which
he
always
offers
with
a
sort
of
argumentative
*NL*
frankness
,
``
hard
up

My

not
in

partial
to

not

fine
a
point
upon
it

when
they
*NL*
want
anything

But
she
was
rather
took
by
something
about
this

person

whether
by
his
being
unshaved

by
his
hair
being
in
want

of
attention

by
what
other

reasons

I
leave
you
to
judge

she
accepted
of
the
specimen

likewise
of
the
address

My
*NL*
little
woman
has

a
good
ear

proceeds
Mr.
Snagsby
after
*NL*
consulting
his
cough
of
consideration
behind
his
hand
,
``
and
she
*NL*
considered
Nemo
equally
the
same
as
Nimrod

In
consequence
of
which
,
*NL*
she
got
into
a
habit
of
saying
to
me
at
meals
,
`
Mr.
Snagsby
,
you
*NL*
have

found
Nimrod
any
work
yet

Mr.

give
that
eight

thirty
Chancery
folio
in

Nimrod

*NL*
such
like

And
that
is
the
way
he
gradually
fell
into
job-work
at
our
*NL*
place
;
and
that
is
the
most
I
know
of
him
except
that
he
was
a
quick
*NL*
hand
,

a
hand
not
sparing
of
night-work

that
if
you
gave
him
*NL*
out

five

forty
folio
on

you
would
have

it
brought
in

Thursday

All

Mr.
Snagsby
*NL*
concludes
by
politely
motioning
with
his
hat
towards
the
bed
,
as
much
*NL*
as
to
add
,
``
I
have
no

confirm

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Mr.

to
Krook
,
``

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
so
there
is
!
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
does
not
appear
to
have
*NL*
seen
it
before
,
though
he
is
standing
so
close
to
it

there
is
very

heaven

The
marine-store
merchant
holds
the
light

the
law-stationer
*NL*
conducts
the
search

The
surgeon
leans
against
the
corner

the
*NL*
chimney-piece

Miss

peeps

trembles
just

black
breeches

tied

ribbons

his
large
black
waistcoat

his
*NL*
long-sleeved
black
coat

his
wisp
of
limp
white
neckerchief
tied
*NL*
in
the
bow
the
peerage
knows
so
well

stands
in
exactly
the

*NL*
place
and
attitude

*NL*
*NL*
There
are
some
worthless
articles
of
clothing
in
the
old
portmanteau

*NL*
there
is
a
bundle
of
pawnbrokers

duplicates

those
turnpike
tickets
*NL*
on
the
road

poverty

there
is
a
crumpled
paper

smelling
of
opium

*NL*
on
which
are
scrawled
rough
memoranda

as
,
took

such
a

so
many

took

off

There
are
a

dirty
scraps

all
referring

coroners

there
is
nothing

They
search
the
cupboard

the
drawer

the
ink-splashed
table

There
is
not

The
young
surgeon
*NL*
examines
the
dress
on
the
law-writer

A
knife

some
odd
halfpence
*NL*
are
all
he
finds

Mr.
Snagsby
's
suggestion
is
the
practical
*NL*
suggestion
after
all
,
and
the
beadle
must
be
called
in

*NL*

So
the
little
crazy

goes
for

come
out

``
Do

says
the

``

Mr.

therefore
drives
her
out
before
him

she

goes
furtively
downstairs

winding
her
lithe

licking
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

Mr.

*NL*
By
this
time
the
news
has
got
into
the
court

Groups
of
its
*NL*
inhabitants
assemble
to
discuss
the
thing
,
and
the
outposts
of
the
*NL*
army
of
observation
-LRB-
principally
boys
-RRB-
are
pushed
forward
to
Mr.
*NL*
Krook
's
window
,
which
they
closely
invest
.
A
policeman
has
already
*NL*
walked
up
to
the
room
,
and
walked
down
again
to
the
door
,
where
he
*NL*
stands
like
a
tower
,
only
condescending
to
see
the
boys
at
his
base
*NL*
occasionally
;
but
whenever
he
does
see
them
,
they
quail
and
fall
*NL*
back
.
Mrs.
Perkins
,
who
has
not
been
for
some
weeks
on
speaking
terms

with
Mrs.
Piper
in
consequence
for
an
unpleasantness
originating
in
*NL*
young
Perkins
'
having
``
fetched
''
young
Piper
``
a
crack

renews
her
*NL*
friendly
intercourse
on
this
auspicious
occasion
.
The
potboy
at
the
*NL*
corner
,
who
is
a
privileged
amateur
,
as
possessing
official
knowledge
*NL*
of
life
and
having
to
deal
with
drunken
men
occasionally
,
exchanges
*NL*
confidential
communications
with
the
policeman
and
has
the
appearance
*NL*
of
an
impregnable
youth
,
unassailable
by
truncheons
and
unconfinable
*NL*
in
station-houses
.
People
talk
across
the
court
out
of
window
,
and
*NL*
bare-headed
scouts
come
hurrying
in
from
Chancery
Lane
to
know
what
's
*NL*
the
matter
.
The
general
feeling
seems
to
be
that
it
's
a
blessing
Mr.
*NL*
Krook
war
n't
made
away
with
first
,
mingled
with
a
little
natural
*NL*
disappointment
that
he
was
not
.
In
the
midst
of
this
sensation
,
the
*NL*
beadle
arrives
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beadle
,
though
generally
understood
in
the
neighbourhood
to
be
a
*NL*
ridiculous
institution
,
is
not
without
a
certain
popularity
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
if
it
were
only
as
a
man
who
is
going
to
see
the
body
.
The
*NL*
policeman
considers
him
an
imbecile
civilian
,
a
remnant
of
the
*NL*
barbarous
watchmen
times
,
but
gives
him
admission
as
something
that
*NL*
must
be
borne
with
until
government
shall
abolish
him
.
The
sensation
*NL*
is
heightened
as
the
tidings
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
the
*NL*
beadle
is
on
the
ground
and
has
gone
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
the
beadle
comes
out
,
once
more
intensifying
the
sensation
,
*NL*
which
has
rather
languished
in
the
interval
.
He
is
understood
to
be
*NL*
in
want
of
witnesses
for
the
inquest
to-morrow
who
can
tell
the
*NL*
coroner
and
jury
anything
whatever
respecting
the
deceased
.
Is
*NL*
immediately
referred
to
innumerable
people
who
can
tell
nothing
*NL*
whatever
.
Is
made
more
imbecile
by
being
constantly
informed
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Green
's
son
``
was
a
law-writer
his-self
and
knowed
him
better
*NL*
than
anybody

which
son
of
Mrs.

present
time

vessel
bound
for
China

three
months

general
idiotcy
exasperating
the
public
.
*NL*
Policeman
seen
to
smile
to
potboy
.
Public
loses
interest
and
*NL*
undergoes
reaction
.
Taunts
the
beadle
in
shrill
youthful
voices
with
*NL*
having
boiled
a
boy
,
choruses
fragments
of
a
popular
song
to
that
*NL*
effect
and
importing
that
the
boy
was
made
into
soup
for
the
*NL*
workhouse
.
Policeman
at
last
finds
it
necessary
to
support
the
law
*NL*
and
seize
a
vocalist
,
who
is
released
upon
the
flight
of
the
rest
on
*NL*
condition
of
his
getting
out
of
this
then
,
come
,
and
cutting
it
--
a
*NL*
condition
he
immediately
observes
.
So
the
sensation
dies
off
for
the
*NL*
time
;
and
the
unmoved
policeman
-LRB-
to
whom
a
little
opium
,
more
or
*NL*
less
,
is
nothing
-RRB-
,
with
his
shining
hat
,
stiff
stock
,
inflexible
*NL*
great-coat
,
stout
belt
and
bracelet
,
and
all
things
fitting
,
pursues
*NL*
his
lounging
way
with
a
heavy
tread
,
beating
the
palms
of
his
white
*NL*
gloves
one
against
the
other
and
stopping
now
and
then
at
a
*NL*
street-corner
to
look
casually
about
for
anything
between
a
lost
*NL*
child
and
a
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
cover
of
the
night
,
the
feeble-minded
beadle
comes
flitting
*NL*
about
Chancery
Lane
with
his
summonses
,
in
which
every
juror
's
name
*NL*
is
wrongly
spelt
,
and
nothing
rightly
spelt
but
the
beadle
's
own
*NL*
name
,
which
nobody
can
read
or
wants
to
know
.
The
summonses
served
*NL*
and
his
witnesses
forewarned
,
the
beadle
goes
to
Mr.
Krook
's
to
keep
*NL*
a
small
appointment
he
has
made
with
certain
paupers
,
who
,
presently
*NL*
arriving
,
are
conducted
upstairs
,
where
they
leave
the
great
eyes
in
*NL*
the
shutter
something
new
to
stare
at
,
in
that
last
shape
which
*NL*
earthly
lodgings
take
for
No
one
--
and
for
Every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
that
night
the
coffin
stands
ready
by
the
old
portmanteau
;
*NL*
and
the
lonely
figure
on
the
bed
,
whose
path
in
life
has
lain
through
*NL*
five
and
forty
years
,
lies
there
with
no
more
track
behind
him
that
*NL*
any
one
can
trace
than
a
deserted
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
court
is
all
alive
--
is
like
a
fair
,
as
Mrs.
Perkins
,
*NL*
more
than
reconciled
to
Mrs.
Piper
,
says
in
amicable
conversation
*NL*
with
that
excellent
woman
.
The
coroner
is
to
sit
in
the
first-floor
*NL*
room
at
the
Sol
's
Arms
,
where
the
Harmonic
Meetings
take
place
twice
*NL*
a
week
and
where
the
chair
is
filled
by
a
gentleman
of
professional
*NL*
celebrity
,
faced
by
Little
Swills
,
the
comic
vocalist
,
who
hopes
*NL*
-LRB-
according
to
the
bill
in
the
window
-RRB-
that
his
friends
will
rally
*NL*
round
him
and
support
first-rate
talent
.
The
Sol
's
Arms
does
a
brisk
*NL*
stroke
of
business
all
the
morning
.
Even
children
so
require
*NL*
sustaining
under
the
general
excitement
that
a
pieman
who
has
*NL*
established
himself
for
the
occasion
at
the
corner
of
the
court
says
*NL*
his
brandy-balls
go
off
like
smoke
.
What
time
the
beadle
,
hovering
*NL*
between
the
door
of
Mr.
Krook
's
establishment
and
the
door
of
the
*NL*
Sol
's
Arms
,
shows
the
curiosity
in
his
keeping
to
a
few
discreet
*NL*
spirits
and
accepts
the
compliment
of
a
glass
of
ale
or
so
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
hour
arrives
the
coroner
,
for
whom
the
jurymen
are
*NL*
waiting
and
who
is
received
with
a
salute
of
skittles
from
the
good
*NL*
dry
skittle-ground
attached
to
the
Sol
's
Arms
.
The
coroner
frequents
*NL*
more
public-houses
than
any
man
alive
.
The
smell
of
sawdust
,
beer
,
*NL*
tobacco-smoke
,
and
spirits
is
inseparable
in
his
vocation
from
death
*NL*
in
its
most
awful
shapes
.
He
is
conducted
by
the
beadle
and
the
*NL*
landlord
to
the
Harmonic
Meeting
Room
,
where
he
puts
his
hat
on
the
*NL*
piano
and
takes
a
Windsor-chair
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
formed
of
*NL*
several
short
tables
put
together
and
ornamented
with
glutinous
rings
*NL*
in
endless
involutions
,
made
by
pots
and
glasses
.
As
many
of
the
jury
*NL*
as
can
crowd
together
at
the
table
sit
there
.
The
rest
get
among
the
*NL*
spittoons
and
pipes
or
lean
against
the
piano
.
Over
the
coroner
's
*NL*
head
is
a
small
iron
garland
,
the
pendant
handle
of
a
bell
,
which
*NL*
rather
gives
the
majesty
of
the
court
the
appearance
of
going
to
be
*NL*
hanged
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Call
over
and
swear
the
jury
!
While
the
ceremony
is
in
progress
,
*NL*
sensation
is
created
by
the
entrance
of
a
chubby
little
man
in
a
*NL*
large
shirt-collar
,
with
a
moist
eye
and
an
inflamed
nose
,
who
*NL*
modestly
takes
a
position
near
the
door
as
one
of
the
general
public
,
*NL*
but
seems
familiar
with
the
room
too
.
A
whisper
circulates
that
this
*NL*
is
Little
Swills
.
It
is
considered
not
unlikely
that
he
will
get
up
*NL*
an
imitation
of
the
coroner
and
make
it
the
principal
feature
of
the
*NL*
Harmonic
Meeting
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
--
''
the
coroner
begins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
there
,
will
you
!
''
says
the
beadle
.
Not
to
the
coroner
,
*NL*
though
it
might
appear
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
''
resumes
the
coroner
.
``
You
are
impanelled
here
to
*NL*
inquire
into
the
death
of
a
certain
man
.
Evidence
will
be
given
*NL*
before
you
as
to
the
circumstances
attending
that
death
,
and
you
will
*NL*
give
your
verdict
according
to
the
--
skittles
;
they
must
be
stopped
,
*NL*
you
know
,
beadle
!
--
evidence
,
and
not
according
to
anything
else
.
The
*NL*
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
view
the
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
way
there
!
''
cries
the
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
go
out
in
a
loose
procession
,
something
after
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
straggling
funeral
,
and
make
their
inspection
in
Mr.
Krook
's
back
*NL*
second
floor
,
from
which
a
few
of
the
jurymen
retire
pale
and
*NL*
precipitately
.
The
beadle
is
very
careful
that
two
gentlemen
not
very
*NL*
neat
about
the
cuffs
and
buttons
-LRB-
for
whose
accommodation
he
has
*NL*
provided
a
special
little
table
near
the
coroner
in
the
Harmonic
*NL*
Meeting
Room
-RRB-
should
see
all
that
is
to
be
seen
.
For
they
are
the
*NL*
public
chroniclers
of
such
inquiries
by
the
line
;
and
he
is
not
*NL*
superior
to
the
universal
human
infirmity
,
but
hopes
to
read
in
print
*NL*
what
``
Mooney
,
the
active
and
intelligent
beadle
of
the
district
,
''
*NL*
said
and
did
and
even
aspires
to
see
the
name
of
Mooney
as
familiarly
*NL*
and
patronizingly
mentioned
as
the
name
of
the
hangman
is
,
according
*NL*
to
the
latest
examples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Swills
is
waiting
for
the
coroner
and
jury
on
their
return
.
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
also
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
received
with
distinction
*NL*
and
seated
near
the
coroner
between
that
high
judicial
officer
,
a
*NL*
bagatelle-board
,
and
the
coal-box
.
The
inquiry
proceeds
.
The
jury
*NL*
learn
how
the
subject
of
their
inquiry
died
,
and
learn
no
more
about
*NL*
him
.
``
A
very
eminent
solicitor
is
in
attendance
,
gentlemen
,
''
says
the
*NL*
coroner
,
``
who
,
I
am
informed
,
was
accidentally
present
when
discovery
*NL*
of
the
death
was
made
,
but
he
could
only
repeat
the
evidence
you
have
*NL*
already
heard
from
the
surgeon
,
the
landlord
,
the
lodger
,
and
the
*NL*
law-stationer
,
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
trouble
him
.
Is
anybody
in
*NL*
attendance
who
knows
anything
more
?

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Piper
pushed
forward
by
Mrs.
Perkins
.
Mrs.
Piper
sworn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anastasia
Piper
,
gentlemen
.
Married
woman
.
Now
,
Mrs.
Piper
,
what
have
*NL*
you
got
to
say
about
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
Mrs.
Piper
has
a
good
deal
to
say
,
chiefly
in
parentheses
and
*NL*
without
punctuation
,
but
not
much
to
tell
.
Mrs.
Piper
lives
in
the
*NL*
court
-LRB-
which
her
husband
is
a
cabinet-maker
-RRB-
,
and
it
has
long
been
*NL*
well
beknown
among
the
neighbours
-LRB-
counting
from
the
day
next
but
one
*NL*
before
the
half-baptizing
of
Alexander
James
Piper
aged
eighteen
*NL*
months
and
four
days
old
on
accounts
of
not
being
expected
to
live
*NL*
such
was
the
sufferings
gentlemen
of
that
child
in
his
gums
-RRB-
as
the
*NL*
plaintive
--
so
Mrs.
Piper
insists
on
calling
the
deceased
--
was
*NL*
reported
to
have
sold
himself
.
Thinks
it
was
the
plaintive
's
air
in
*NL*
which
that
report
originatinin
.
See
the
plaintive
often
and
*NL*
considered
as
his
air
was
feariocious
and
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
*NL*
about
some
children
being
timid
-LRB-
and
if
doubted
hoping
Mrs.
Perkins
*NL*
may
be
brought
forard
for
she
is
here
and
will
do
credit
to
her
*NL*
husband
and
herself
and
family
-RRB-
.
Has
seen
the
plaintive
wexed
and
*NL*
worrited
by
the
children
-LRB-
for
children
they
will
ever
be
and
you
*NL*
can
not
expect
them
specially
if
of
playful
dispositions
to
be
*NL*
Methoozellers
which
you
was
not
yourself
-RRB-
.
On
accounts
of
this
and
*NL*
his
dark
looks
has
often
dreamed
as
she
see
him
take
a
pick-axe
from
*NL*
his
pocket
and
split
Johnny
's
head
-LRB-
which
the
child
knows
not
fear
*NL*
and
has
repeatually
called
after
him
close
at
his
eels
-RRB-
.
Never
*NL*
however
see
the
plaintive
take
a
pick-axe
or
any
other
wepping
far
*NL*
from
it
.
Has
seen
him
hurry
away
when
run
and
called
after
as
if
not
*NL*
partial
to
children
and
never
see
him
speak
to
neither
child
nor
*NL*
grown
person
at
any
time
-LRB-
excepting
the
boy
that
sweeps
the
crossing
*NL*
down
the
lane
over
the
way
round
the
corner
which
if
he
was
here
*NL*
would
tell
you
that
he
has
been
seen
a-speaking
to
him
frequent
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Says
the
coroner
,
is
that
boy
here
?
Says
the
beadle
,
no
,
sir
,
he
is
*NL*
not
here
.
Says
the
coroner
,
go
and
fetch
him
then
.
In
the
absence
of
*NL*
the
active
and
intelligent
,
the
coroner
converses
with
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh

Here
's
the
boy
,
gentlemen
!
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
is
,
very
muddy
,
very
hoarse
,
very
ragged

Now
,
boy
!
But
stop
*NL*
a
minute

Caution

This
boy
must
be
put
through
a

paces

Nothing

Never
heerd
of

a
think

Do
n't
know
that
Jo
is
*NL*
short
for

Thinks
it
long
enough
for
HIM
.
HE
do
n't
find
*NL*
no
fault
with
it

Spell
it

No

HE
ca
n't
spell

No

Never

What

Knows
a

broom
's
a
broom

and
knows
it
's
wicked
to
tell
a

Do
n't
recollect
*NL*
who
told
him
about
the
broom
or
about
the
lie
,
but
knows
both
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
exactly
say
what
'll
be
done
to
him
arter
he
's
dead
if
he
tells
a
lie
*NL*
to
the
gentlemen
here

believes
it
'll
be
something
wery
bad
to

punish
him

right

so
he
'll
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``

Very
well

Here

the
habit
of
taking
opium
in
large
quantities
for
a
year
and
a
half
,
*NL*
found
dead
of
too
much
opium

If
you

any
evidence
to

lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
he
committed
suicide

you
will
come
*NL*
to
that
conclusion

*NL*
While
the
coroner
buttons
his
great-coat
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
and
he
give
*NL*
private
audience
to
the
rejected
witness
in
a
corner

*NL*
*NL*
That
graceless
creature
only
knows
that
the
dead
man
-LRB-
whom
he
*NL*
recognized
just
now
by
his
yellow
face
and
black
hair
-RRB-
was
sometimes
*NL*
hooted
and
pursued
about
the
streets

That
one
cold
winter
night
when
*NL*
he
,
the
boy
,
was
shivering
in
a
doorway
near
his
crossing
,
the
man
*NL*
turned
to
look
at
him
,
and
came
back
,
and
having
questioned
him
and
*NL*
found
that
he
had
not
a
friend
in
the
world
,
said
,
``
Neither
have
I.
*NL*
Not
one
!
''
and
gave
him
the
price
of
a
supper
and
a
night
's
lodging
.
*NL*
That
the
man
had
often
spoken
to
him
since
and
asked
him
whether
he

slept
sound
at
night

how
he
bore
cold

hunger

whether
he
*NL*

similar
strange
questions
.
That
when
the
man
*NL*
had
no
money
,
he
would
say
in
passing
,
``
I
am
as
poor
as
you
to-day
,
*NL*
Jo
,
''
but
that
when
he
had
any
,
he
had
always
-LRB-
as
the
boy
most
*NL*
heartily
believes
-RRB-
been
glad
to
give
him
some
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
wery
good
to
me
,
''
says
the
boy
,
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
*NL*
wretched
sleeve
.
``
Wen
I
see
him
a-layin
'
so
stritched
out
just
now
,
I
*NL*
wished
he
could
have
heerd
me
tell
him
so
.
He
wos
wery
good
to
me
,
he
*NL*
wos
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
shuffles
downstairs
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
lying
in
wait
for
him
,
puts
a
*NL*
half-crown
in
his
hand
.
``
If
you
ever
see
me
coming
past
your
crossing
*NL*
with
my
little
woman
--
I
mean
a
lady
--
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
with
his
*NL*
finger
on
his
nose
,
``
do
n't
allude
to
it
!

For
some
little
time
the
jurymen
hang
about
the
Sol
's
Arms
*NL*
colloquially
.
In
the
sequel
,
half-a-dozen
are
caught
up
in
a
cloud
of
*NL*
pipe-smoke
that
pervades
the
parlour
of
the
Sol
's
Arms
;
two
stroll
to
*NL*
Hampstead
;
and
four
engage
to
go
half-price
to
the
play
at
night
,
and
*NL*
top
up
with
oysters
.
Little
Swills
is
treated
on
several
hands
.
Being
*NL*
asked
what
he
thinks
of
the
proceedings
,
characterizes
them
-LRB-
his
*NL*
strength
lying
in
a
slangular
direction
-RRB-
as
``
a
rummy
start
.
''
The
*NL*
landlord
of
the
Sol
's
Arms
,
finding
Little
Swills
so
popular
,
*NL*
commends
him
highly
to
the
jurymen
and
public
,
observing
that
for
a
*NL*
song
in
character
he
do
n't
know
his
equal
and
that
that
man
's
*NL*
character-wardrobe
would
fill
a
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
gradually
the
Sol
's
Arms
melts
into
the
shadowy
night
and
then
*NL*
flares
out
of
it
strong
in
gas
.
The
Harmonic
Meeting
hour
arriving
,
*NL*
the
gentleman
of
professional
celebrity
takes
the
chair
,
is
faced
*NL*
-LRB-
red-faced
-RRB-
by
Little
Swills
;
their
friends
rally
round
them
and
*NL*
support
first-rate
talent
.
In
the
zenith
of
the
evening
,
Little
*NL*
Swills
says
,
``
Gentlemen
,
if
you
'll
permit
me
,
I
'll
attempt
a
short
*NL*
description
of
a
scene
of
real
life
that
came
off
here
to-day
.
''
Is
*NL*
much
applauded
and
encouraged
;
goes
out
of
the
room
as
Swills
;
comes
*NL*
in
as
the
coroner
-LRB-
not
the
least
in
the
world
like
him
-RRB-
;
describes
*NL*
the
inquest
,
with
recreative
intervals
of
piano-forte
accompaniment
,
*NL*
to
the
refrain
:
With
his
-LRB-
the
coroner
's
-RRB-
tippy
tol
li
doll
,
tippy
tol
*NL*
lo

*NL*
*NL*
The
jingling
piano
at
last
is
silent
,
and
the
Harmonic
friends
rally
*NL*
round
their
pillows
.
Then
there
is
rest
around
the
lonely
figure
,
now
*NL*
laid
in
its
last
earthly
habitation
;
and
it
is
watched
by
the
gaunt
*NL*
eyes
in
the
shutters
through
some
quiet
hours
of
night
.
If
this
*NL*
forlorn
man
could
have
been
prophetically
seen
lying
here
by
the
*NL*
mother
at
whose
breast
he
nestled
,
a
little
child
,
with
eyes
upraised
*NL*
to
her
loving
face
,
and
soft
hand
scarcely
knowing
how
to
close
upon
*NL*
the
neck
to
which
it
crept
,
what
an
impossibility
the
vision
would
*NL*
have
seemed
!
Oh
,
if
in
brighter
days
the
now-extinguished
fire
within
*NL*
him
ever
burned
for
one
woman
who
held
him
in
her
heart
,
where
is
*NL*
she
,
while
these
ashes
are
above
the
ground
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
anything
but
a
night
of
rest
at
Mr.
Snagsby
's
,
in
Cook
's
Court
,
*NL*
where
Guster
murders
sleep
by
going
,
as
Mr.
Snagsby
himself
*NL*
allows
--
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
--
out
of
one
fit
into
*NL*
twenty
.
The
occasion
of
this
seizure
is
that
Guster
has
a
tender
*NL*
heart
and
a
susceptible
something
that
possibly
might
have
been
*NL*
imagination
,
but
for
Tooting
and
her
patron
saint
.
Be
it
what
it
may
,
*NL*
now
,
it
was
so
direfully
impressed
at
tea-time
by
Mr.
Snagsby
's
*NL*
account
of
the
inquiry
at
which
he
had
assisted
that
at
supper-time
*NL*
she
projected
herself
into
the
kitchen
,
preceded
by
a
flying
Dutch
*NL*
cheese
,
and
fell
into
a
fit
of
unusual
duration
,
which
she
only
came
*NL*
out
of
to
go
into
another
,
and
another
,
and
so
on
through
a
chain
of
*NL*
fits
,
with
short
intervals
between
,
of
which
she
has
pathetically
*NL*
availed
herself
by
consuming
them
in
entreaties
to
Mrs.
Snagsby
not
*NL*
to
give
her
warning
``
when
she
quite
comes
to
,
''
and
also
in
appeals
to
*NL*
the
whole
establishment
to
lay
her
down
on
the
stones
and
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
Hence
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
at
last
hearing
the
cock
at
the
little
dairy
in
*NL*
Cursitor
Street
go
into
that
disinterested
ecstasy
of
his
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
daylight
,
says
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
though
the
most
*NL*
patient
of
men
,
``
I
thought
you
was
dead
,
I
am
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
question
this
enthusiastic
fowl
supposes
he
settles
when
he
*NL*
strains
himself
to
such
an
extent
,
or
why
he
should
thus
crow
-LRB-
so
men
*NL*
crow
on
various
triumphant
public
occasions
,
however
-RRB-
about
what
*NL*
can
not
be
of
any
moment
to
him
,
is
his
affair
.
It
is
enough
that
*NL*
daylight
comes
,
morning
comes
,
noon
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
active
and
intelligent
,
who
has
got
into
the
morning
papers
*NL*
as
such
,
comes
with
his
pauper
company
to
Mr.
Krook
's
and
bears
off
*NL*
the
body
of
our
dear
brother
here
departed
to
a
hemmed-in
churchyard
,
*NL*
pestiferous
and
obscene
,
whence
malignant
diseases
are
communicated
*NL*
to
the
bodies
of
our
dear
brothers
and
sisters
who
have
not
departed
,
*NL*
while
our
dear
brothers
and
sisters
who
hang
about
official
*NL*
back-stairs
--
would
to
heaven
they
HAD
departed
!
--
are
very
complacent
*NL*
and
agreeable
.
Into
a
beastly
scrap
of
ground
which
a
Turk
would
*NL*
reject
as
a
savage
abomination
and
a
Caffre
would
shudder
at
,
they
*NL*
bring
our
dear
brother
here
departed
to
receive
Christian
burial
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
houses
looking
on
,
on
every
side
,
save
where
a
reeking
little
*NL*
tunnel
of
a
court
gives
access
to
the
iron
gate
--
with
every
villainy
*NL*
of
life
in
action
close
on
death
,
and
every
poisonous
element
of
*NL*
death
in
action
close
on
life
--
here
they
lower
our
dear
brother
down
*NL*
a
foot
or
two
,
here
sow
him
in
corruption
,
to
be
raised
in
*NL*
corruption
:
an
avenging
ghost
at
many
a
sick-bedside
,
a
shameful
*NL*
testimony
to
future
ages
how
civilization
and
barbarism
walked
this
*NL*
boastful
island
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Come
night
,
come
darkness
,
for
you
can
not
come
too
soon
or
stay
too
*NL*
long
by
such
a
place
as
this
!
Come
,
straggling
lights
into
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
ugly
houses
;
and
you
who
do
iniquity
therein
,
do
it
at
*NL*
least
with
this
dread
scene
shut
out
!
Come
,
flame
of
gas
,
burning
so
*NL*
sullenly
above
the
iron
gate
,
on
which
the
poisoned
air
deposits
its
*NL*
witch-ointment
slimy
to
the
touch
!
It
is
well
that
you
should
call
to
*NL*
every
passerby
,
``
Look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
night
comes
a
slouching
figure
through
the
tunnel-court
to
*NL*
the
outside
of
the
iron
gate
.
It
holds
the
gate
with
its
hands
and
*NL*
looks
in
between
the
bars
,
stands
looking
in
for
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
then
,
with
an
old
broom
it
carries
,
softly
sweeps
the
step
and
*NL*
makes
the
archway
clean
.
It
does
so
very
busily
and
trimly
,
looks
in
*NL*
again
a
little
while
,
and
so
departs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
,
is
it
thou
?
Well
,
well
!
Though
a
rejected
witness
,
who
``
ca
n't
*NL*
exactly
say
''
what
will
be
done
to
him
in
greater
hands
than
men
's
,
*NL*
thou
art
not
quite
in
outer
darkness
.
There
is
something
like
a
*NL*
distant
ray
of
light
in
thy
muttered
reason
for
this
:
``
He
wos
wery
*NL*
good
to

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Watch
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
left
off
raining
down
in
Lincolnshire
at
last
,
and
Chesney
*NL*
Wold
has
taken
heart
.
Mrs.
Rouncewell
is
full
of
hospitable
cares
,
*NL*
for
Sir
Leicester
and
my
Lady
are
coming
home
from
Paris
.
The
*NL*
fashionable
intelligence
has
found
it
out
and
communicates
the
glad
*NL*
tidings
to
benighted
England
.
It
has
also
found
out
that
they
will
*NL*
entertain
a
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
of
the
ELITE
of
the
*NL*
BEAU
MONDE
-LRB-
the
fashionable
intelligence
is
weak
in
English
,
but
a
*NL*
giant
refreshed
in
French
-RRB-
at
the
ancient
and
hospitable
family
seat
*NL*
in
Lincolnshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
greater
honour
of
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
,
and
*NL*
of
Chesney
Wold
into
the
bargain
,
the
broken
arch
of
the
bridge
in
*NL*
the
park
is
mended
;
and
the
water
,
now
retired
within
its
proper
*NL*
limits
and
again
spanned
gracefully
,
makes
a
figure
in
the
prospect
*NL*
from
the
house
.
The
clear
,
cold
sunshine
glances
into
the
brittle
*NL*
woods
and
approvingly
beholds
the
sharp
wind
scattering
the
leaves
*NL*
and
drying
the
moss
.
It
glides
over
the
park
after
the
moving
shadows
*NL*
of
the
clouds
,
and
chases
them
,
and
never
catches
them
,
all
day
.
It
*NL*
looks
in
at
the
windows
and
touches
the
ancestral
portraits
with
bars
*NL*
and
patches
of
brightness
never
contemplated
by
the
painters
.
Athwart
*NL*
the
picture
of
my
Lady
,
over
the
great
chimney-piece
,
it
throws
a
*NL*
broad
bend-sinister
of
light
that
strikes
down
crookedly
into
the
*NL*
hearth
and
seems
to
rend
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
same
cold
sunshine
and
the
same
sharp
wind
,
my
Lady
and
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
,
in
their
travelling
chariot
-LRB-
my
Lady
's
woman
and
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
's
man
affectionate
in
the
rumble
-RRB-
,
start
for
home
.
With
a
*NL*
considerable
amount
of
jingling
and
whip-cracking
,
and
many
plunging
*NL*
demonstrations
on
the
part
of
two
bare-backed
horses
and
two
centaurs
*NL*
with
glazed
hats
,
jack-boots
,
and
flowing
manes
and
tails
,
they
*NL*
rattle
out
of
the
yard
of
the
Hotel
Bristol
in
the
Place
Vendome
and
*NL*
canter
between
the
sun-and-shadow-chequered
colonnade
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Rivoli
and
the
garden
of
the
ill-fated
palace
of
a
headless
king
and
*NL*
queen
,
off
by
the
Place
of
Concord
,
and
the
Elysian
Fields
,
and
the
*NL*
Gate
of
the
Star
,
out
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sooth
to
say
,
they
can
not
go
away
too
fast
,
for
even
here
my
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
has
been
bored
to
death
.
Concert
,
assembly
,
opera
,
theatre
,
*NL*
drive
,
nothing
is
new
to
my
Lady
under
the
worn-out
heavens
.
Only
*NL*
last
Sunday
,
when
poor
wretches
were
gay
--
within
the
walls
playing
*NL*
with
children
among
the
clipped
trees
and
the
statues
in
the
Palace
*NL*
Garden
;
walking
,
a
score
abreast
,
in
the
Elysian
Fields
,
made
more
*NL*
Elysian
by
performing
dogs
and
wooden
horses
;
between
whiles
*NL*
filtering
-LRB-
a
few
-RRB-
through
the
gloomy
Cathedral
of
Our
Lady
to
say
a
*NL*
word
or
two
at
the
base
of
a
pillar
within
flare
of
a
rusty
little
*NL*
gridiron-full
of
gusty
little
tapers
;
without
the
walls
encompassing
*NL*
Paris
with
dancing
,
love-making
,
wine-drinking
,
tobacco-smoking
,
*NL*
tomb-visiting
,
billiard
card
and
domino
playing
,
quack-doctoring
,
and
*NL*
much
murderous
refuse
,
animate
and
inanimate
--
only
last
Sunday
,
my
*NL*
Lady
,
in
the
desolation
of
Boredom
and
the
clutch
of
Giant
Despair
,
*NL*
almost
hated
her
own
maid
for
being
in
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
can
not
,
therefore
,
go
too
fast
from
Paris
.
Weariness
of
soul
lies
*NL*
before
her
,
as
it
lies
behind
--
her
Ariel
has
put
a
girdle
of
it
round
*NL*
the
whole
earth
,
and
it
can
not
be
unclasped
--
but
the
imperfect
remedy
*NL*
is
always
to
fly
from
the
last
place
where
it
has
been
experienced
.
*NL*
Fling
Paris
back
into
the
distance
,
then
,
exchanging
it
for
endless
*NL*
avenues
and
cross-avenues
of
wintry
trees
!
And
,
when
next
beheld
,
let
*NL*
it
be
some
leagues
away
,
with
the
Gate
of
the
Star
a
white
speck
*NL*
glittering
in
the
sun
,
and
the
city
a
mere
mound
in
a
plain
--
two
dark
*NL*
square
towers
rising
out
of
it
,
and
light
and
shadow
descending
on
it
*NL*
aslant
,
like
the
angels
in
Jacob
's
dream
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
is
generally
in
a
complacent
state
,
and
rarely
bored
.
*NL*
When
he
has
nothing
else
to
do
,
he
can
always
contemplate
his
own
*NL*
greatness
.
It
is
a
considerable
advantage
to
a
man
to
have
so
*NL*
inexhaustible
a
subject
.
After
reading
his
letters
,
he
leans
back
in
*NL*
his
corner
of
the
carriage
and
generally
reviews
his
importance
to
*NL*
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
an
unusual
amount
of
correspondence
this
morning
?
''
says
my
*NL*
Lady
after
a
long
time
.
She
is
fatigued
with
reading
.
Has
almost
read
*NL*
a
page
in
twenty
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
in
it
,
though
.
Nothing
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
one
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
long
effusions
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
everything

says
Sir

with
admiration

*NL*
*NL*
``

sighs
my
Lady

``
He
is
the
most
tiresome
of
men

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
sends

I
really
beg
your

he
sends

''
says
Sir
Leicester
,
*NL*
selecting
the
letter
and
unfolding
it
,
``
a
message
to
you

Our
*NL*
stopping
to
change
horses
as
I
came
to
his
postscript
drove
it
out
of
*NL*
my
memory
.
I
beg
you
'll
excuse
me
.
He
says
--
''
Sir
Leicester
is
so
*NL*
long
in
taking
out
his
eye-glass
and
adjusting
it
that
my
Lady
looks
*NL*
a
little
irritated
.
``
He
says
`
In
the
matter
of
the
right
of
way
--

I
*NL*
beg
your
pardon

that
's
not

He
says
--
yes

Here
I
have
it

*NL*
He
says
,

I
beg
my
respectful
compliments
to
my

who

I
hope

*NL*
has
benefited

Will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
mention
-LRB-
as
*NL*
it
may
interest
her

in
reference
to
the
person
who
copied
the
affidavit
in
the
Chancery
*NL*
suit
,
which
so
powerfully
stimulated
her
curiosity
.
I
have
seen
*NL*
him
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
,
leaning
forward
,
looks
out
of
her
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
message
,
''
observes
Sir
Leicester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
walk
a
little
,
''
says
my
Lady
,
still
looking
out
of
*NL*
her
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walk
?
''
repeats
Sir
Leicester
in
a
tone
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
walk
a
little
,
''
says
my
Lady
with
unmistakable
*NL*
distinctness
.
``
Please
to
stop
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
is
stopped
,
the
affectionate
man
alights
from
the
*NL*
rumble
,
opens
the
door
,
and
lets
down
the
steps
,
obedient
to
an
*NL*
impatient
motion
of
my
Lady
's
hand
.
My
Lady
alights
so
quickly
and
*NL*
walks
away
so
quickly
that
Sir
Leicester
,
for
all
his
scrupulous
*NL*
politeness
,
is
unable
to
assist
her
,
and
is
left
behind
.
A
space
of
a
*NL*
minute
or
two
has
elapsed
before
he
comes
up
with
her
.
She
smiles
,
*NL*
looks
very
handsome
,
takes
his
arm
,
lounges
with
him
for
a
quarter
of
*NL*
a
mile
,
is
very
much
bored
,
and
resumes
her
seat
in
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rattle
and
clatter
continue
through
the
greater
part
of
three
*NL*
days
,
with
more
or
less
of
bell-jingling
and
whip-cracking
,
and
more
*NL*
or
less
plunging
of
centaurs
and
bare-backed
horses
.
Their
courtly
*NL*
politeness
to
each
other
at
the
hotels
where
they
tarry
is
the
theme
*NL*
of
general
admiration
.
Though
my
Lord
IS
a
little
aged
for
my
Lady
,
*NL*
says
Madame
,
the
hostess
of
the
Golden
Ape
,
and
though
he
might
be
*NL*
her
amiable
father
,
one
can
see
at
a
glance
that
they
love
each
*NL*
other
.
One
observes
my
Lord
with
his
white
hair
,
standing
,
hat
in
*NL*
hand
,
to
help
my
Lady
to
and
from
the
carriage
.
One
observes
my
Lady
,
*NL*
how
recognisant
of
my
Lord
's
politeness
,
with
an
inclination
of
her
*NL*
gracious
head
and
the
concession
of
her
so-genteel
fingers
!
It
is
*NL*
ravishing
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea
has
no
appreciation
of
great
men
,
but
knocks
them
about
like
*NL*
the
small
fry
.
It
is
habitually
hard
upon
Sir
Leicester
,
whose
*NL*
countenance
it
greenly
mottles
in
the
manner
of
sage-cheese
and
in
*NL*
whose
aristocratic
system
it
effects
a
dismal
revolution
.
It
is
the
*NL*
Radical
of
Nature
to
him
.
Nevertheless
,
his
dignity
gets
over
it
*NL*
after
stopping
to
refit
,
and
he
goes
on
with
my
Lady
for
Chesney
*NL*
Wold
,
lying
only
one
night
in
London
on
the
way
to
Lincolnshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
same
cold
sunlight
,
colder
as
the
day
declines
,
and
*NL*
through
the
same
sharp
wind
,
sharper
as
the
separate
shadows
of
bare
*NL*
trees
gloom
together
in
the
woods
,
and
as
the
Ghost
's
Walk
,
touched
*NL*
at
the
western
corner
by
a
pile
of
fire
in
the
sky
,
resigns
itself
to
*NL*
coming
night
,
they
drive
into
the
park
.
The
rooks
,
swinging
in
their
*NL*
lofty
houses
in
the
elm-tree
avenue
,
seem
to
discuss
the
question
of
*NL*
the
occupancy
of
the
carriage
as
it
passes
underneath
,
some
agreeing
*NL*
that
Sir
Leicester
and
my
Lady
are
come
down
,
some
arguing
with
*NL*
malcontents
who
wo
n't
admit
it
,
now
all
consenting
to
consider
the
*NL*
question
disposed
of
,
now
all
breaking
out
again
in
violent
debate
,
*NL*
incited
by
one
obstinate
and
drowsy
bird
who
will
persist
in
putting
*NL*
in
a
last
contradictory
croak
.
Leaving
them
to
swing
and
caw
,
the
*NL*
travelling
chariot
rolls
on
to
the
house
,
where
fires
gleam
warmly
*NL*
through
some
of
the
windows
,
though
not
through
so
many
as
to
give
an
*NL*
inhabited
expression
to
the
darkening
mass
of
front
.
But
the
*NL*
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
will
soon
do
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
is
in
attendance
and
receives
Sir
Leicester
's
*NL*
customary
shake
of
the
hand
with
a
profound
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
?
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
have
the
honour
of
welcoming
you
in
good
health
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
excellent
health
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lady
is
looking
charmingly
well
,
''
says
Mrs.
Rouncewell
with
*NL*
another
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
signifies
,
without
profuse
expenditure
of
words
,
that
she
is
*NL*
as
wearily
well
as
she
can
hope
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rosa
is
in
the
distance
,
behind
the
housekeeper
;
and
my
Lady
,
who
*NL*
has
not
subdued
the
quickness
of
her
observation
,
whatever
else
she
*NL*
may
have
conquered
,
asks
,
``
Who
is
that
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
scholar
of
mine
,
my
Lady
.
Rosa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
Rosa
!
''
Lady
Dedlock
beckons
her
,
with
even
an
appearance
*NL*
of
interest
.
``
Why
,
do
you
know
how
pretty
you
are
,
child
?
''
she
says
,
*NL*
touching
her
shoulder
with
her
two
forefingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
,
very
much
abashed
,
says
,
``
No
,
if
you
please
,
my
Lady
!
''
and
*NL*
glances
up
,
and
glances
down
,
and
do
n't
know
where
to
look
,
but
looks
*NL*
all
the
prettier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
,
my
Lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
,
''
repeats
my
Lady
thoughtfully
.
``
Take
care
they
do
n't
spoil
*NL*
you
by
flattery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
Lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
taps
her
dimpled
cheek
with
the
same
delicate
gloved
fingers
*NL*
and
goes
on
to
the
foot
of
the
oak
staircase
,
where
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
pauses
for
her
as
her
knightly
escort
.
A
staring
old
Dedlock
in
a
*NL*
panel
,
as
large
as
life
and
as
dull
,
looks
as
if
he
did
n't
know
what
*NL*
to
make
of
it
,
which
was
probably
his
general
state
of
mind
in
the
*NL*
days
of
Queen
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
Rosa
can
do
nothing
but
*NL*
murmur
Lady
Dedlock
's
praises
.
She
is
so
affable
,
so
graceful
,
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
so
elegant
;
has
such
a
sweet
voice
and
such
a
thrilling
*NL*
touch
that
Rosa
can
feel
it
yet
!
Mrs.
Rouncewell
confirms
all
this
,
*NL*
not
without
personal
pride
,
reserving
only
the
one
point
of
*NL*
affability
.
Mrs.
Rouncewell
is
not
quite
sure
as
to
that
.
Heaven
*NL*
forbid
that
she
should
say
a
syllable
in
dispraise
of
any
member
of
*NL*
that
excellent
family
,
above
all
,
of
my
Lady
,
whom
the
whole
world
*NL*
admires
;
but
if
my
Lady
would
only
be
``
a
little
more
free
,
''
not
quite
*NL*
so
cold
and
distant
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
thinks
she
would
be
more
*NL*
affable
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
almost
a
pity
,
''
Mrs.
Rouncewell
adds
--
only
``
almost
''
because
it
*NL*
borders
on
impiety
to
suppose
that
anything
could
be
better
than
it
*NL*
is
,
in
such
an
express
dispensation
as
the
Dedlock
affairs
--
``
that
my
*NL*
Lady
has
no
family
.
If
she
had
had
a
daughter
now
,
a
grown
young
*NL*
lady
,
to
interest
her
,
I
think
she
would
have
had
the
only
kind
of
*NL*
excellence
she
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
not
that
have
made
her
still
more
proud
,
grandmother
?
''
says
*NL*
Watt
,
who
has
been
home
and
come
back
again
,
he
is
such
a
good
*NL*
grandson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
and
most
,
my
dear
,
''
returns
the
housekeeper
with
dignity
,
``
are
*NL*
words
it
's
not
my
place
to
use
--
nor
so
much
as
to
hear

*NL*
any
drawback
on
my
Lady

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

reason

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
Watt
,
``
it
's
to
be
hoped
they
line
out
of
their
*NL*
prayer-books
a
certain
passage
for
the
common
people
about
pride
and
*NL*
vainglory
.
Forgive
me
,
grandmother
!
Only
a
joke
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
and
Lady
Dedlock
,
my
dear
,
are
not
fit
subjects
for
*NL*
joking

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
is
no
joke
by
any
means
,
''
says
Watt
,
``
and
I
humbly
ask
*NL*
his
pardon
.
I
suppose
,
grandmother
,
that
even
with
the
family
and
*NL*
their
guests
down
here
,
there
is
no
objection
to
my
prolonging
my
*NL*
stay
at
the
Dedlock
Arms
for
a
day
or
two
,
as
any
other
traveller
*NL*
might
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
none
in
the
world
,
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
that
,
''
says
Watt
,
``
because
I
have
an
inexpressible
*NL*
desire
to
extend
my
knowledge
of
this
beautiful
neighbourhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
happens
to
glance
at
Rosa
,
who
looks
down
and
is
very
shy
indeed
.
*NL*
But
according
to
the
old
superstition
,
it
should
be
Rosa
's
ears
that
*NL*
burn
,
and
not
her
fresh
bright
cheeks
,
for
my
Lady
's
maid
is
holding
*NL*
forth
about
her
at
this
moment
with
surpassing
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
's
maid
is
a
Frenchwoman
of
two
and
thirty
,
from
somewhere
in
*NL*
the
southern
country
about
Avignon
and
Marseilles
,
a
large-eyed
brown
*NL*
woman
with
black
hair
who
would
be
handsome
but
for
a
certain
feline
*NL*
mouth
and
general
uncomfortable
tightness
of
face
,
rendering
the
jaws
*NL*
too
eager
and
the
skull
too
prominent
.
There
is
something
indefinably
*NL*
keen
and
wan
about
her
anatomy
,
and
she
has
a
watchful
way
of
looking
*NL*
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
without
turning
her
head
which
could
*NL*
be
pleasantly
dispensed
with
,
especially
when
she
is
in
an
ill
humour
*NL*
and
near
knives
.
Through
all
the
good
taste
of
her
dress
and
little
*NL*
adornments
,
these
objections
so
express
themselves
that
she
seems
to
*NL*
go
about
like
a
very
neat
she-wolf
imperfectly
tamed
.
Besides
being
*NL*
accomplished
in
all
the
knowledge
appertaining
to
her
post
,
she
is
*NL*
almost
an
Englishwoman
in
her
acquaintance
with
the
language
;
*NL*
consequently
,
she
is
in
no
want
of
words
to
shower
upon
Rosa
for
*NL*
having
attracted
my
Lady
's
attention
,
and
she
pours
them
out
with
*NL*
such
grim
ridicule
as
she
sits
at
dinner
that
her
companion
,
the
*NL*
affectionate
man
,
is
rather
relieved
when
she
arrives
at
the
spoon
*NL*
stage
of
that
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
She
,
Hortense
,
been
in
my
Lady
's
service
since
five
years
*NL*
and
always
kept
at
the
distance
,
and
this
doll
,
this
puppet
,
*NL*
caressed
--
absolutely
caressed
--
by
my
Lady
on
the
moment
of
her
*NL*
arriving
at
the
house
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
``
And
do
you
know
how
pretty
you
*NL*
are
,
child
?
''
``
No
,
my
Lady
.
''
You
are
right
there
!
``
And
how
old
are
*NL*
you
,
child
!
And
take
care
they
do
not
spoil
you
by
flattery
,
child
!
''
*NL*
Oh
,
how
droll
!
It
is
the
BEST
thing
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
it
is
such
an
admirable
thing
that
Mademoiselle
Hortense
*NL*
ca
n't
forget
it
;
but
at
meals
for
days
afterwards
,
even
among
her
*NL*
countrywomen
and
others
attached
in
like
capacity
to
the
troop
of
*NL*
visitors
,
relapses
into
silent
enjoyment
of
the
joke
--
an
enjoyment
*NL*
expressed
,
in
her
own
convivial
manner
,
by
an
additional
tightness
of
*NL*
face
,
thin
elongation
of
compressed
lips
,
and
sidewise
look
,
which
*NL*
intense
appreciation
of
humour
is
frequently
reflected
in
my
Lady
's
*NL*
mirrors
when
my
Lady
is
not
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
mirrors
in
the
house
are
brought
into
action
now
,
many
of
*NL*
them
after
a
long
blank
.
They
reflect
handsome
faces
,
simpering
*NL*
faces
,
youthful
faces
,
faces
of
threescore
and
ten
that
will
not
*NL*
submit
to
be
old
;
the
entire
collection
of
faces
that
have
come
to
*NL*
pass
a
January
week
or
two
at
Chesney
Wold
,
and
which
the
fashionable
*NL*
intelligence
,
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
Lord
,
hunts
with
a
keen
*NL*
scent
,
from
their
breaking
cover
at
the
Court
of
St.
James
's
to
their
*NL*
being
run
down
to
death
.
The
place
in
Lincolnshire
is
all
alive
.
By
*NL*
day
guns
and
voices
are
heard
ringing
in
the
woods
,
horsemen
and
*NL*
carriages
enliven
the
park
roads
,
servants
and
hangers-on
pervade
the
*NL*
village
and
the
Dedlock
Arms
.
Seen
by
night
from
distant
openings
in
*NL*
the
trees
,
the
row
of
windows
in
the
long
drawing-room
,
where
my
*NL*
Lady
's
picture
hangs
over
the
great
chimney-piece
,
is
like
a
row
of
*NL*
jewels
set
in
a
black
frame
.
On
Sunday
the
chill
little
church
is
*NL*
almost
warmed
by
so
much
gallant
company
,
and
the
general
flavour
of
*NL*
the
Dedlock
dust
is
quenched
in
delicate
perfumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
comprehends
within
it
no
*NL*
contracted
amount
of
education
,
sense
,
courage
,
honour
,
beauty
,
and
*NL*
virtue
.
Yet
there
is
something
a
little
wrong
about
it
in
despite
of
*NL*
its
immense
advantages
.
What
can
it
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dandyism
?
There
is
no
King
George
the
Fourth
now
-LRB-
more
the
pity
-RRB-
to
*NL*
set
the
dandy
fashion
;
there
are
no
clear-starched
jack-towel
*NL*
neckcloths
,
no
short-waisted
coats
,
no
false
calves
,
no
stays
.
There
*NL*
are
no
caricatures
,
now
,
of
effeminate
exquisites
so
arrayed
,
*NL*
swooning
in
opera
boxes
with
excess
of
delight
and
being
revived
by
*NL*
other
dainty
creatures
poking
long-necked
scent-bottles
at
their
*NL*
noses
.
There
is
no
beau
whom
it
takes
four
men
at
once
to
shake
into
*NL*
his
buckskins
,
or
who
goes
to
see
all
the
executions
,
or
who
is
*NL*
troubled
with
the
self-reproach
of
having
once
consumed
a
pea
.
But
is
*NL*
there
dandyism
in
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
*NL*
notwithstanding
,
dandyism
of
a
more
mischievous
sort
,
that
has
got
*NL*
below
the
surface
and
is
doing
less
harmless
things
than
*NL*
jack-towelling
itself
and
stopping
its
own
digestion
,
to
which
no
*NL*
rational
person
need
particularly
object
?
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
yes
.
It
can
not
be
disguised
.
There
ARE
at
Chesney
Wold
this
*NL*
January
week
some
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
newest
fashion
,
who
*NL*
have
set
up
a
dandyism
--
in
religion
,
for
instance
.
Who
in
mere
*NL*
lackadaisical
want
of
an
emotion
have
agreed
upon
a
little
dandy
talk
*NL*
about
the
vulgar
wanting
faith
in
things
in
general
,
meaning
in
the
*NL*
things
that
have
been
tried
and
found
wanting
,
as
though
a
low
fellow
*NL*
should
unaccountably
lose
faith
in
a
bad
shilling
after
finding
it
*NL*
out
!
Who
would
make
the
vulgar
very
picturesque
and
faithful
by
*NL*
putting
back
the
hands
upon
the
clock
of
time
and
cancelling
a
few
*NL*
hundred
years
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
also
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
another
fashion
,
not
so
new
,
*NL*
but
very
elegant
,
who
have
agreed
to
put
a
smooth
glaze
on
the
world
*NL*
and
to
keep
down
all
its
realities
.
For
whom
everything
must
be
*NL*
languid
and
pretty
.
Who
have
found
out
the
perpetual
stoppage
.
Who
*NL*
are
to
rejoice
at
nothing
and
be
sorry
for
nothing
.
Who
are
not
to
be
*NL*
disturbed
by
ideas
.
On
whom
even
the
fine
arts
,
attending
in
powder
*NL*
and
walking
backward
like
the
Lord
Chamberlain
,
must
array
themselves
*NL*
in
the
milliners
'
and
tailors
'
patterns
of
past
generations
and
be
*NL*
particularly
careful
not
to
be
in
earnest
or
to
receive
any
impress
*NL*
from
the
moving
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
is
my
Lord
Boodle
,
of
considerable
reputation
with
his
*NL*
party
,
who
has
known
what
office
is
and
who
tells
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
with
much
gravity
,
after
dinner
,
that
he
really
does
not
see
*NL*
to
what
the
present
age
is
tending
.
A
debate
is
not
what
a
debate
*NL*
used
to
be
;
the
House
is
not
what
the
House
used
to
be
;
even
a
*NL*
Cabinet
is
not
what
it
formerly
was
.
He
perceives
with
astonishment
*NL*
that
supposing
the
present
government
to
be
overthrown
,
the
limited
*NL*
choice
of
the
Crown
,
in
the
formation
of
a
new
ministry
,
would
lie
*NL*
between
Lord
Coodle
and
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
--
supposing
it
to
be
*NL*
impossible
for
the
Duke
of
Foodle
to
act
with
Goodle
,
which
may
be
*NL*
assumed
to
be
the
case
in
consequence
of
the
breach
arising
out
of
*NL*
that
affair
with
Hoodle
.
Then
,
giving
the
Home
Department
and
the
*NL*
leadership
of
the
House
of
Commons
to
Joodle
,
the
Exchequer
to
*NL*
Koodle
,
the
Colonies
to
Loodle
,
and
the
Foreign
Office
to
Moodle
,
*NL*
what
are
you
to
do
with
Noodle
?
You
ca
n't
offer
him
the
Presidency
of
*NL*
the
Council
;
that
is
reserved
for
Poodle
.
You
ca
n't
put
him
in
the
*NL*
Woods
and
Forests
;
that
is
hardly
good
enough
for
Quoodle
.
What
*NL*
follows
?
That
the
country
is
shipwrecked
,
lost
,
and
gone
to
pieces
*NL*
-LRB-
as
is
made
manifest
to
the
patriotism
of
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
-RRB-
*NL*
because
you
ca
n't
provide
for
Noodle
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Right
Honourable
William
Buffy
,
M.P.
,
contends
*NL*
across
the
table
with
some
one
else
that
the
shipwreck
of
the
*NL*
country
--
about
which
there
is
no
doubt
;
it
is
only
the
manner
of
it
*NL*
that
is
in
question
--
is
attributable
to
Cuffy
.
If
you
had
done
with
*NL*
Cuffy
what
you
ought
to
have
done
when
he
first
came
into
Parliament
,
*NL*
and
had
prevented
him
from
going
over
to
Duffy
,
you
would
have
got
*NL*
him
into
alliance
with
Fuffy
,
you
would
have
had
with
you
the
weight
*NL*
attaching
as
a
smart
debater
to
Guffy
,
you
would
have
brought
to
bear
*NL*
upon
the
elections
the
wealth
of
Huffy
,
you
would
have
got
in
for
*NL*
three
counties
Juffy
,
Kuffy
,
and
Luffy
,
and
you
would
have
*NL*
strengthened
your
administration
by
the
official
knowledge
and
the
*NL*
business
habits
of
Muffy
.
All
this
,
instead
of
being
as
you
now
are
,
*NL*
dependent
on
the
mere
caprice
of
Puffy
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
this
point
,
and
as
to
some
minor
topics
,
there
are
differences
*NL*
of
opinion
;
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
the
brilliant
and
*NL*
distinguished
circle
,
all
round
,
that
nobody
is
in
question
but
*NL*
Boodle
and
his
retinue
,
and
Buffy
and
HIS
retinue
.
These
are
the
*NL*
great
actors
for
whom
the
stage
is
reserved
.
A
People
there
are
,
no
*NL*
doubt
--
a
certain
large
number
of
supernumeraries
,
who
are
to
be
*NL*
occasionally
addressed
,
and
relied
upon
for
shouts
and
choruses
,
as
*NL*
on
the
theatrical
stage
;
but
Boodle
and
Buffy
,
their
followers
and
*NL*
families
,
their
heirs
,
executors
,
administrators
,
and
assigns
,
are
*NL*
the
born
first-actors
,
managers
,
and
leaders
,
and
no
others
can
*NL*
appear
upon
the
scene
for
ever
and
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
,
too
,
there
is
perhaps
more
dandyism
at
Chesney
Wold
than
the
*NL*
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
will
find
good
for
itself
in
the
*NL*
long
run
.
For
it
is
,
even
with
the
stillest
and
politest
circles
,
as
*NL*
with
the
circle
the
necromancer
draws
around
him
--
very
strange
*NL*
appearances
may
be
seen
in
active
motion
outside
.
With
this
*NL*
difference
,
that
being
realities
and
not
phantoms
,
there
is
the
*NL*
greater
danger
of
their
breaking
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
is
quite
full
anyhow
,
so
full
that
a
burning
sense
of
*NL*
injury
arises
in
the
breasts
of
ill-lodged
ladies
'
-
maids
,
and
is
not
*NL*
to
be
extinguished
.
Only
one
room
is
empty
.
It
is
a
turret
chamber
of
*NL*
the
third
order
of
merit
,
plainly
but
comfortably
furnished
and
*NL*
having
an
old-fashioned
business
air
.
It
is
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
room
,
*NL*
and
is
never
bestowed
on
anybody
else
,
for
he
may
come
at
any
time
.
*NL*
He
is
not
come
yet
.
It
is
his
quiet
habit
to
walk
across
the
park
*NL*
from
the
village
in
fine
weather
,
to
drop
into
this
room
as
if
he
had
*NL*
never
been
out
of
it
since
he
was
last
seen
there
,
to
request
a
*NL*
servant
to
inform
Sir
Leicester
that
he
is
arrived
in
case
he
should
*NL*
be
wanted
,
and
to
appear
ten
minutes
before
dinner
in
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
library-door
.
He
sleeps
in
his
turret
with
a
complaining
*NL*
flag-staff
over
his
head
,
and
has
some
leads
outside
on
which
,
any
*NL*
fine
morning
when
he
is
down
here
,
his
black
figure
may
be
seen
*NL*
walking
before
breakfast
like
a
larger
species
of
rook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
before
dinner
,
my
Lady
looks
for
him
in
the
dusk
of
the
*NL*
library
,
but
he
is
not
there
.
Every
day
at
dinner
,
my
Lady
glances
*NL*
down
the
table
for
the
vacant
place
that
would
be
waiting
to
receive
*NL*
him
if
he
had
just
arrived
,
but
there
is
no
vacant
place
.
Every
night
*NL*
my
Lady
casually
asks
her
maid
,
``
Is
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
night
the
answer
is
,
``
No
,
my
Lady
,
not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
while
having
her
hair
undressed
,
my
Lady
loses
herself
in
*NL*
deep
thought
after
this
reply
until
she
sees
her
own
brooding
face
in
*NL*
the
opposite
glass
,
and
a
pair
of
black
eyes
curiously
observing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
so
good
as
to
attend
,
''
says
my
Lady
then
,
addressing
the
*NL*
reflection
of
Hortense
,
``
to
your
business
.
You
can
contemplate
your
*NL*
beauty
at
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
!
It
was
your
Ladyship
's
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
says
my
Lady
,
``
you
need
n't
contemplate
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
one
afternoon
a
little
before
sunset
,
when
the
bright
*NL*
groups
of
figures
which
have
for
the
last
hour
or
two
enlivened
the
*NL*
Ghost
's
Walk
are
all
dispersed
and
only
Sir
Leicester
and
my
Lady
*NL*
remain
upon
the
terrace
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
appears
.
He
comes
towards
*NL*
them
at
his
usual
methodical
pace
,
which
is
never
quickened
,
never
*NL*
slackened
.
He
wears
his
usual
expressionless
mask
--
if
it
be
a
*NL*
mask
--
and
carries
family
secrets
in
every
limb
of
his
body
and
every
*NL*
crease
of
his
dress
.
Whether
his
whole
soul
is
devoted
to
the
great
*NL*
or
whether
he
yields
them
nothing
beyond
the
services
he
sells
is
his
*NL*
personal
secret
.
He
keeps
it
,
as
he
keeps
the
secrets
of
his
clients
;
*NL*
he
is
his
own
client
in
that
matter
,
and
will
never
betray
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
?
''
says
Sir
Leicester
,
giving
him
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
quite
well
.
Sir
Leicester
is
quite
well
.
My
Lady
*NL*
is
quite
well
.
All
highly
satisfactory
.
The
lawyer
,
with
his
hands
*NL*
behind
him
,
walks
at
Sir
Leicester
's
side
along
the
terrace
.
My
Lady
*NL*
walks
upon
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
expected
you
before
,
''
says
Sir
Leicester
.
A
gracious
observation
.
*NL*
As
much
as
to
say
,
``
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
we
remember
your
existence
when
*NL*
you
are
not
here
to
remind
us
of
it
by
your
presence
.
We
bestow
a
*NL*
fragment
of
our
minds
upon
you
,
sir
,
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
comprehending
it
,
inclines
his
head
and
says
he
is
*NL*
much
obliged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
come
down
sooner
,
''
he
explains
,
``
but
that
I
have
been
*NL*
much
engaged
with
those
matters
in
the
several
suits
between
yourself
*NL*
and
Boythorn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
of
a
very
ill-regulated
mind
,
''
observes
Sir
Leicester
with
*NL*
severity
.
``
An
extremely
dangerous
person
in
any
community
.
A
man
of
a
*NL*
very
low
character
of
mind

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
obstinate
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
natural
to
such
a
man
to
be
so
,
''
says
Sir
Leicester
,
looking
*NL*
most
profoundly
obstinate
himself
.
``
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
question
is
,
''
pursues
the
lawyer
,
``
whether
you
will
give
up
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
replies
Sir
Leicester
.
``
Nothing
.
I
give
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
anything
of
importance

That
,
of
course
,
I
know
you
*NL*
would
not
abandon

I
mean
any
minor
point

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Tulkinghorn

''
returns
Sir
Leicester
,
``
there
can
be
no
minor

point

If
I
go
farther

observe
*NL*
that
I
can
not
readily
conceive
how
ANY
right
of
mine
can
be
a
minor

point

I
speak
not
so
much
in
reference

myself

an
individual

the
family
position
I
have
it
in

*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
inclines
his
head
again
.
``
I
have
now
my

instructions

he
says
.
``
Mr.
Boythorn
will
give
us
a
good
deal
of

trouble

Sir
Leicester

interrupts
him

adds
Sir

after
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
appears
to
discharge
his
stately
breast
of
a
burden
in
*NL*
passing

thing

executed

*NL*
``
But
night
is
coming

says
he

take
cold

As
they
turn
towards
the
hall-door
,
Lady
Dedlock
addresses
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sent
me
a
message
respecting
the
person
whose
writing
I
happened
*NL*
to
inquire
about
.
It
was
like
you
to
remember
the
circumstance
;
I
had
*NL*
quite
forgotten
it
.
Your
message
reminded
me
of
it
again
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
what
association
I
had
with
a
hand
like
that
,
but
I
surely
*NL*
had
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
some
?

Mr.
Tulkinghorn
repeats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
returns
my
Lady
carelessly
.
``
I
think
I
must
have
had
some

*NL*
And
did
you
really
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
the
writer
of
that
*NL*
actual
thing

what
is
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
odd

*NL*
*NL*
They
pass
into
a
sombre
breakfast-room
on
the
ground
floor
,
lighted
*NL*
in
the
day
by
two
deep
windows
.
It
is
now
twilight
.
The
fire
glows
*NL*
brightly
on
the
panelled
wall
and
palely
on
the
window-glass
,
where
,
*NL*
through
the
cold
reflection
of
the
blaze
,
the
colder
landscape
*NL*
shudders
in
the
wind
and
a
grey
mist
creeps
along
,
the
only
traveller
*NL*
besides
the
waste
of
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
lounges
in
a
great
chair
in
the
chimney-corner
,
and
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
takes
another
great
chair
opposite
.
The
lawyer
stands
*NL*
before
the
fire
with
his
hand
out
at
arm
's
length
,
shading
his
face
.
*NL*
He
looks
across
his
arm
at
my
Lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
says
,
``
I
inquired
about
the
man

found
him

And
,
what
*NL*
is
very
strange

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Lady
Dedlock

languidly
anticipates

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

remonstrated
Sir
Leicester
.
Not
so
much
shocked
by
the
*NL*
fact
as
by
the
fact
of
the
fact
being
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
directed
to

poverty-stricken

my

speaking
-RRB-
.
``
It
is
quite
a
story
for
twilight

How
very
shocking

*NL*
Dead

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
re-asserts
it
by
another
inclination
of
his
head
.
*NL*
``
Whether
by
his

*NL*
*NL*

Sir

my

Go
on

Mr.
Tulkinghorn

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
's
gallantry
concedes
the
point
,
though
he
still
feels
*NL*
that
to
bring
this
sort
of
squalor
among
the
upper
classes
is
*NL*
really
--
really
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
about
to
say
,
''
resumes
the
lawyer
with
undisturbed
calmness
,
*NL*
``
that
whether
he
had
died
by
his
own
hand
or
not
,
it
was
beyond
my
*NL*
power
to
tell
you
.
I
should
amend
that
phrase
,
however
,
by
saying
*NL*
that
he
had
unquestionably
died
of
his
own
act
,
though
whether
by
his
*NL*
own
deliberate
intention
or
by
mischance
can
never
certainly
be
*NL*
known
.
The
coroner
's
jury
found
that
he
took
the
poison
*NL*
accidentally
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
kind
of
man
,
''
my
Lady
asks
,
``
was
this
deplorable
creature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
difficult
to
say
,
''
returns
the
lawyer
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
He
*NL*
had
lived
so
wretchedly
and
was
so
neglected
,
with
his
gipsy
colour
*NL*
and
his
wild
black
hair
and
beard
,
that
I
should
have
considered
him
*NL*
the
commonest
of
the
common
.
The
surgeon
had
a
notion
that
he
had
*NL*
once
been
something
better
,
both
in
appearance
and
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
they
call
the
wretched
being
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
called
him
what
he
had
called
himself

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

In

I

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
any
clue
to

more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
any

there
was
,

says
the
lawyer
meditatively
,
``
an
old
*NL*
portmanteau
,
but
--
No
,
there
were
no
papers

''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
utterance
of
every
word
of
this
short
dialogue
,
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
and
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
without
any
other
alteration
in
their
*NL*
customary
deportment
,
have
looked
very
steadily
at
one
another
--
as
*NL*
was
natural
,
perhaps
,
in
the
discussion
of
so
unusual
a
subject
.
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
has
looked
at
the
fire
,
with
the
general
expression
of
the
*NL*
Dedlock
on
the
staircase
.
The
story
being
told
,
he
renews
his
stately
*NL*
protest
,
saying
that
as
it
is
quite
clear
that
no
association
in
my
*NL*
Lady
's
mind
can
possibly
be
traceable
to
this
poor
wretch
-LRB-
unless
he
*NL*
was
a
begging-letter
writer
-RRB-
,
he
trusts
to
hear
no
more
about
a
*NL*
subject
so
far
removed
from
my
Lady
's
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
a
collection
of
horrors
,
''
says
my
Lady
,
gathering
up
her
*NL*
mantles
and
furs
,
``
but
they
interest
one
for
the
moment
!
Have
the
*NL*
kindness
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
to
open
the
door
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
does
so
with
deference
and
holds
it
open
while
she
*NL*
passes
out
.
She
passes
close
to
him
,
with
her
usual
fatigued
manner
*NL*
and
insolent
grace
.
They
meet
again
at
dinner
--
again
,
next
*NL*
day
--
again
,
for
many
days
in
succession
.
Lady
Dedlock
is
always
the
*NL*
same
exhausted
deity
,
surrounded
by
worshippers
,
and
terribly
liable
*NL*
to
be
bored
to
death
,
even
while
presiding
at
her
own
shrine
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
is
always
the
same
speechless
repository
of
noble
*NL*
confidences
,
so
oddly
out
of
place
and
yet
so
perfectly
at
home
.
They
*NL*
appear
to
take
as
little
note
of
one
another
as
any
two
people
*NL*
enclosed
within
the
same
walls
could
.
But
whether
each
evermore
*NL*
watches
and
suspects
the
other
,
evermore
mistrustful
of
some
great
*NL*
reservation
;
whether
each
is
evermore
prepared
at
all
points
for
the
*NL*
other
,
and
never
to
be
taken
unawares
;
what
each
would
give
to
know
*NL*
how
much
the
other
knows
--
all
this
is
hidden
,
for
the
time
,
in
their
*NL*
own
hearts

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
held
many
consultations
about
what
Richard
was
to
be
,
first
*NL*
without
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
as
he
had
requested
,
and
afterwards
with
him
,
*NL*
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
seemed
to
make
progress
.
Richard
*NL*
said
he
was
ready
for
anything
.
When
Mr.
Jarndyce
doubted
whether
he
*NL*
might
not
already
be
too
old
to
enter
the
Navy
,
Richard
said
he
had
*NL*
thought
of
that
,
and
perhaps
he
was
.
When
Mr.
Jarndyce
asked
him
what
*NL*
he
thought
of
the
Army
,
Richard
said
he
had
thought
of
that
,
too
,
and
*NL*
it
was
n't
a
bad
idea
.
When
Mr.
Jarndyce
advised
him
to
try
and
decide
*NL*
within
himself
whether
his
old
preference
for
the
sea
was
an
ordinary
*NL*
boyish
inclination
or
a
strong
impulse
,
Richard
answered
,
Well
he
*NL*
really
HAD
tried
very
often
,
and
he
could
n't
make
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
of
this
indecision
of
character
,
''
Mr.
Jarndyce
said
to
me
,
*NL*
``
is
chargeable
on
that
incomprehensible
heap
of
uncertainty
and
*NL*
procrastination
on
which
he
has
been
thrown
from
his
birth
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
pretend
to
say
;
but
that
Chancery
,
among
its
other
sins
,
is
*NL*
responsible
for
some
of
it
,
I
can
plainly
see
.
It
has
engendered
or
*NL*
confirmed
in
him
a
habit
of
putting
off
--
and
trusting
to
this
,
that
,
*NL*
and
the
other
chance
,
without
knowing
what
chance
--
and
dismissing
*NL*
everything
as
unsettled
,
uncertain
,
and
confused
.
The
character
of
*NL*
much
older
and
steadier
people
may
be
even
changed
by
the
*NL*
circumstances
surrounding
them
.
It
would
be
too
much
to
expect
that
a
*NL*
boy
's
,
in
its
formation
,
should
be
the
subject
of
such
influences
and
*NL*
escape
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
this
to
be
true
;
though
if
I
may
venture
to
mention
what
I
*NL*
thought
besides
,
I
thought
it
much
to
be
regretted
that
Richard
's
*NL*
education
had
not
counteracted
those
influences
or
directed
his
*NL*
character
.
He
had
been
eight
years
at
a
public
school
and
had
learnt
,
*NL*
I
understood
,
to
make
Latin
verses
of
several
sorts
in
the
most
*NL*
admirable
manner
.
But
I
never
heard
that
it
had
been
anybody
's
*NL*
business
to
find
out
what
his
natural
bent
was
,
or
where
his
failings
*NL*
lay
,
or
to
adapt
any
kind
of
knowledge
to
HIM
.
HE
had
been
adapted
to
*NL*
the
verses
and
had
learnt
the
art
of
making
them
to
such
perfection
*NL*
that
if
he
had
remained
at
school
until
he
was
of
age
,
I
suppose
he
*NL*
could
only
have
gone
on
making
them
over
and
over
again
unless
he
had
*NL*
enlarged
his
education
by
forgetting
how
to
do
it
.
Still
,
although
I
*NL*
had
no
doubt
that
they
were
very
beautiful
,
and
very
improving
,
and
*NL*
very
sufficient
for
a
great
many
purposes
of
life
,
and
always
*NL*
remembered
all
through
life
,
I
did
doubt
whether
Richard
would
not
*NL*
have
profited
by
some
one
studying
him
a
little
,
instead
of
his
*NL*
studying
them
quite
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
I
knew
nothing
of
the
subject
and
do
not
even
now
know
*NL*
whether
the
young
gentlemen
of
classic
Rome
or
Greece
made
verses
to
*NL*
the
same
extent
--
or
whether
the
young
gentlemen
of
any
country
ever
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
,
''
said
Richard
,
musing
,
``
what
I
had
better
*NL*
be
.
Except
that
I
am
quite
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
go
into
the
Church
,
*NL*
it
's
a
toss-up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
inclination
in
Mr.
Kenge
's
way
?
''
suggested
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
,
sir
!
''
replied
Richard
.
``
I
am
fond
of
boating
.
*NL*
Articled
clerks
go
a
good
deal
on
the
water
.
It
's
a
capital
*NL*
profession
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surgeon
--
''
suggested
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
thing
,
sir
!
''
cried
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
if
he
had
ever
once
thought
of
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
thing
,
sir
,
''
repeated
Richard
with
the
greatest
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
``
We
have
got
it
at
last
.
M.R.C.S.
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
to
be
laughed
out
of
it
,
though
he
laughed
at
it
heartily
.
*NL*
He
said
he
had
chosen
his
profession
,
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
,
*NL*
the
more
he
felt
that
his
destiny
was
clear
;
the
art
of
healing
was
*NL*
the
art
of
all
others
for
him
.
Mistrusting
that
he
only
came
to
this
*NL*
conclusion
because
,
having
never
had
much
chance
of
finding
out
for
*NL*
himself
what
he
was
fitted
for
and
having
never
been
guided
to
the
*NL*
discovery
,
he
was
taken
by
the
newest
idea
and
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
the
trouble
of
consideration
,
I
wondered
whether
the
Latin
verses
*NL*
often
ended
in
this
or
whether
Richard
's
was
a
solitary
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
took
great
pains
to
talk
with
him
seriously
and
to
put
*NL*
it
to
his
good
sense
not
to
deceive
himself
in
so
important
a
matter
.
*NL*
Richard
was
a
little
grave
after
these
interviews
,
but
invariably
*NL*
told
Ada
and
me
that
it
was
all
right
,
and
then
began
to
talk
about
*NL*
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
heaven
!
''
cried
Mr.
Boythorn
,
who
interested
himself
strongly
in
*NL*
the
subject
--
though
I
need
not
say
that
,
for
he
could
do
nothing
*NL*
weakly
;
``
I
rejoice
to
find
a
young
gentleman
of
spirit
and
gallantry
*NL*
devoting
himself
to
that
noble
profession
!
The
more
spirit
there
is
*NL*
in
it
,
the
better
for
mankind
and
the
worse
for
those
mercenary
*NL*
task-masters
and
low
tricksters
who
delight
in
putting
that
*NL*
illustrious
art
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
world
.
By
all
that
is
base
*NL*
and
despicable
,
''
cried
Mr.
Boythorn
,
``
the
treatment
of
surgeons
*NL*
aboard
ship
is
such
that
I
would
submit
the
legs
--
both
legs
--
of
every
*NL*
member
of
the
Admiralty
Board
to
a
compound
fracture
and
render
it
a
*NL*
transportable
offence
in
any
qualified
practitioner
to
set
them
if
*NL*
the
system
were
not
wholly
changed
in

*NL*
``
Would
n't
you
give
them

asked
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
cried
Mr.
Boythorn
firmly
.
``
Not
on
any
consideration
!
Eight
and
*NL*
forty
hours

As
to
corporations

parishes
,
vestry-boards
,
and
similar
*NL*
gatherings
of
jolter-headed
clods
who
assemble
to
exchange
such
*NL*
speeches
that
,
by
heaven
,
they
ought
to
be
worked
in
quicksilver
*NL*
mines
for
the
short
remainder
of
their
miserable
existence

if
it
*NL*
were
only
to
prevent
their
detestable
English
from
contaminating
a

the

as
to
those
fellows

who
*NL*
meanly
take
advantage

gentlemen

recompense
the
inestimable
services
of
the
best

their
lives

long
study

would

early
life

HOW
thick

may
become

*NL*
*NL*
He
wound
up
this
vehement
declaration
by
looking
round
upon
us
with
a
*NL*
most
agreeable
smile
and
suddenly
thundering
,
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
until
anybody
else
might
have
been
expected
to
be
quite
*NL*
subdued
by
the
exertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Richard
still
continued
to
say
that
he
was
fixed
in
his
choice
*NL*
after
repeated
periods
for
consideration
had
been
recommended
by
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
had
expired
,
and
he
still
continued
to
assure
Ada
and
me
*NL*
in
the
same
final
manner
that
it
was
``
all
right
,
''
it
became
advisable
*NL*
to
take
Mr.
Kenge
into
council
.
Mr.
Kenge
,
therefore
,
came
down
to
*NL*
dinner
one
day
,
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
turned
his
*NL*
eye-glasses
over
and
over
,
and
spoke
in
a
sonorous
voice
,
and
did
*NL*
exactly
what
I
remembered
to
have
seen
him
do
when
I
was
a
little
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
.
``
Yes
.
Well
!
A
very
good
profession

Mr.

Jarndyce

very
good
profession

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
course

study

observed
my
guardian
with
a
glance
at
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no

''
said
Mr.
Kenge
.
``
Diligently

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
being
the
case
,
more

with
all

are

worth

said
Mr.

,
``
it
is
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly

said
Mr.
Kenge
.
``
And
Mr.

meritoriously
acquitted

I

the
classic

in
which
his

no

apply

mistake
-RRB-

not
made

practical

which
he
*NL*
enters

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
rely
upon
it

said
Richard
in
his
off-hand
manner
,
``
that
I

shall
go
at
it

do
my
best

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

Jarndyce

said
Mr.
Kenge
,
gently
nodding
his
head
.
*NL*
``
Really
,
when

are
assured
by
Mr.
Richard
that

nodding
feelingly
and
smoothly
over
those
*NL*
expressions
,
``
I
would
submit

Now
,
with

reference
to
placing
Mr.

some
sufficiently
eminent

Is
there
any
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
my
guardian

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite

observed
Mr.

As

no

*NL*
``
Quite
so

observed
Mr.
Kenge
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
a
little
variety

said
Richard
;
``
I
mean
a
good
range

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
requisite

no

''
returned
Mr.
Kenge
.
``
I
think
this
may
be
*NL*
easily
arranged
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
?
We
have
only
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
*NL*
discover
a
sufficiently
eligible
practitioner
;
and
as
soon
as
we
make
*NL*
our
want
--
and
shall
I
add
,
our
ability
to
pay
a
premium
?
--
known
,
our
*NL*
only
difficulty
will
be
in
the
selection
of
one
from
a
large
number
.
*NL*
We
have
only
,
in
the
second
place
,
to
observe
those
little
*NL*
formalities
which
are
rendered
necessary
by
our
time
of
life
and
our
*NL*
being
under
the
guardianship
of
the
court
.
We
shall
soon
be
--
shall
I
*NL*
say
,
in
Mr.
Richard
's
own
light-hearted
manner
,
`
going
at
it
'
--
to
our
*NL*
heart
's
content
.
It
is
a
coincidence
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
with
a
tinge
of
*NL*
melancholy
in
his
smile
,
``
one
of
those
coincidences
which
may
or
may
*NL*
not
require
an
explanation
beyond
our
present
limited
faculties
,
that
*NL*
I
have
a
cousin
in
the
medical
profession
.
He
might
be
deemed
*NL*
eligible
by
you
and
might
be
disposed
to
respond
to
this
proposal
.
I
*NL*
can
answer
for
him
as
little
as
for
you
,
but
he
MIGHT
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
an
opening
in
the
prospect
,
it
was
arranged
that
Mr.
*NL*
Kenge
should
see
his
cousin
.
And
as
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
before
proposed
*NL*
to
take
us
to
London
for
a
few
weeks
,
it
was
settled
next
day
that
we
*NL*
should
make
our
visit
at
once
and
combine
Richard
's
business
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Boythorn
leaving
us
within
a
week
,
we
took
up
our
abode
at
a
*NL*
cheerful
lodging
near
Oxford
Street
over
an
upholsterer
's
shop
.
*NL*
London
was
a
great
wonder
to
us
,
and
we
were
out
for
hours
and
hours
*NL*
at
a
time
,
seeing
the
sights
,
which
appeared
to
be
less
capable
of
*NL*
exhaustion
than
we
were
.
We
made
the
round
of
the
principal
theatres
,
*NL*
too
,
with
great
delight
,
and
saw
all
the
plays
that
were
worth
*NL*
seeing
.
I
mention
this
because
it
was
at
the
theatre
that
I
began
to
*NL*
be
made
uncomfortable
again
by
Mr.
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
box
one
night
with
Ada
,
and
Richard
was
*NL*
in
the
place
he
liked
best
,
behind
Ada
's
chair
,
when
,
happening
to
*NL*
look
down
into
the
pit
,
I
saw
Mr.
Guppy
,
with
his
hair
flattened
down
*NL*
upon
his
head
and
woe
depicted
in
his
face
,
looking
up
at
me
.
I
felt
*NL*
all
through
the
performance
that
he
never
looked
at
the
actors
but
*NL*
constantly
looked
at
me
,
and
always
with
a
carefully
prepared
*NL*
expression
of
the
deepest
misery
and
the
profoundest
dejection
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
quite
spoiled
my
pleasure
for
that
night
because
it
was
so
very
*NL*
embarrassing
and
so
very
ridiculous
.
But
from
that
time
forth
,
we
*NL*
never
went
to
the
play
without
my
seeing
Mr.
Guppy
in
the
pit
,
always
*NL*
with
his
hair
straight
and
flat
,
his
shirt-collar
turned
down
,
and
a
*NL*
general
feebleness
about
him
.
If
he
were
not
there
when
we
went
in
,
*NL*
and
I
began
to
hope
he
would
not
come
and
yielded
myself
for
a
little
*NL*
while
to
the
interest
of
the
scene
,
I
was
certain
to
encounter
his
*NL*
languishing
eyes
when
I
least
expected
it
and
,
from
that
time
,
to
be
*NL*
quite
sure
that
they
were
fixed
upon
me
all
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
can
not
express
how
uneasy
this
made
me
.
If
he
would
only
*NL*
have
brushed
up
his
hair
or
turned
up
his
collar
,
it
would
have
been
*NL*
bad
enough
;
but
to
know
that
that
absurd
figure
was
always
gazing
at
*NL*
me
,
and
always
in
that
demonstrative
state
of
despondency
,
put
such
a
*NL*
constraint
upon
me
that
I
did
not
like
to
laugh
at
the
play
,
or
to
*NL*
cry
at
it
,
or
to
move
,
or
to
speak
.
I
seemed
able
to
do
nothing
*NL*
naturally
.
As
to
escaping
Mr.
Guppy
by
going
to
the
back
of
the
box
,
*NL*
I
could
not
bear
to
do
that
because
I
knew
Richard
and
Ada
relied
on
*NL*
having
me
next
them
and
that
they
could
never
have
talked
together
so
*NL*
happily
if
anybody
else
had
been
in
my
place
.
So
there
I
sat
,
not
*NL*
knowing
where
to
look
--
for
wherever
I
looked
,
I
knew
Mr.
Guppy
's
eyes
*NL*
were
following
me
--
and
thinking
of
the
dreadful
expense
to
which
this
*NL*
young
man
was
putting
himself
on
my
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
thought
of
telling
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
Then
I
feared
that
the
*NL*
young
man
would
lose
his
situation
and
that
I
might
ruin
him
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
thought
of
confiding
in
Richard
,
but
was
deterred
by
the
*NL*
possibility
of
his
fighting
Mr.
Guppy
and
giving
him
black
eyes
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
thought
,
should
I
frown
at
him
or
shake
my
head
.
Then
I
*NL*
felt
I
could
not
do
it
.
Sometimes
I
considered
whether
I
should
write
*NL*
to
his
mother
,
but
that
ended
in
my
being
convinced
that
to
open
a
*NL*
correspondence
would
be
to
make
the
matter
worse
.
I
always
came
to
*NL*
the
conclusion
,
finally
,
that
I
could
do
nothing
.
Mr.
Guppy
's
*NL*
perseverance
,
all
this
time
,
not
only
produced
him
regularly
at
any
*NL*
theatre
to
which
we
went
,
but
caused
him
to
appear
in
the
crowd
as
we
*NL*
were
coming
out
,
and
even
to
get
up
behind
our
fly
--
where
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
saw
him
,
two
or
three
times
,
struggling
among
the
most
dreadful
*NL*
spikes
.
After
we
got
home
,
he
haunted
a
post
opposite
our
house
.
The
*NL*
upholsterer
's
where
we
lodged
being
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
,
and
*NL*
my
bedroom
window
being
opposite
the
post
,
I
was
afraid
to
go
near
*NL*
the
window
when
I
went
upstairs
,
lest
I
should
see
him
-LRB-
as
I
did
one
*NL*
moonlight
night
-RRB-
leaning
against
the
post
and
evidently
catching
*NL*
cold
.
If
Mr.
Guppy
had
not
been
,
fortunately
for
me
,
engaged
in
the
*NL*
daytime
,
I
really
should
have
had
no
rest
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
making
this
round
of
gaieties
,
in
which
Mr.
Guppy
so
*NL*
extraordinarily
participated
,
the
business
which
had
helped
to
bring
*NL*
us
to
town
was
not
neglected
.
Mr.
Kenge
's
cousin
was
a
Mr.
Bayham
*NL*
Badger
,
who
had
a
good
practice
at
Chelsea
and
attended
a
large
*NL*
public
institution
besides
.
He
was
quite
willing
to
receive
Richard
*NL*
into
his
house
and
to
superintend
his
studies
,
and
as
it
seemed
that
*NL*
those
could
be
pursued
advantageously
under
Mr.
Badger
's
roof
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Badger
liked
Richard
,
and
as
Richard
said
he
liked
Mr.
Badger
*NL*
``
well
enough
,
''
an
agreement
was
made
,
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
consent
*NL*
was
obtained
,
and
it
was
all
settled
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
matters
were
concluded
between
Richard
and
Mr.
*NL*
Badger
,
we
were
all
under
engagement
to
dine
at
Mr.
Badger
's
house
.
*NL*
We
were
to
be
``
merely
a
family
party
,
''
Mrs.
Badger
's
note
said
;
and
*NL*
we
found
no
lady
there
but
Mrs.
Badger
herself
.
She
was
surrounded
in
*NL*
the
drawing-room
by
various
objects
,
indicative
of
her
painting
a
*NL*
little
,
playing
the
piano
a
little
,
playing
the
guitar
a
little
,
*NL*
playing
the
harp
a
little
,
singing
a
little
,
working
a
little
,
*NL*
reading
a
little
,
writing
poetry
a
little
,
and
botanizing
a
little
.
*NL*
She
was
a
lady
of
about
fifty
,
I
should
think
,
youthfully
dressed
,
*NL*
and
of
a
very
fine
complexion
.
If
I
add
to
the
little
list
of
her
*NL*
accomplishments
that
she
rouged
a
little
,
I
do
not
mean
that
there
*NL*
was
any
harm
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bayham
Badger
himself
was
a
pink
,
fresh-faced
,
crisp-looking
*NL*
gentleman
with
a
weak
voice
,
white
teeth
,
light
hair
,
and
surprised
*NL*
eyes
,
some
years
younger
,
I
should
say
,
than
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
.
He
*NL*
admired
her
exceedingly
,
but
principally
,
and
to
begin
with
,
on
the
*NL*
curious
ground
-LRB-
as
it
seemed
to
us
-RRB-
of
her
having
had
three
husbands
.
*NL*
We
had
barely
taken
our
seats
when
he
said
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
quite
*NL*
triumphantly
,
``
You
would
hardly
suppose
that
I
am
Mrs.
Bayham
*NL*
Badger
's
third
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
third
!
''
said
Mr.
Badger
.
``
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
has
not
the
*NL*
appearance

Miss
Summerson
,
of
a
lady
who
has
had
two
former
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
said
``
Not
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Badger
in
a

's
first
*NL*
husband
,
was
a
very
distinguished
officer
indeed
.
The
name
of
*NL*
Professor
Dingo
,
my
immediate
predecessor
,
is
one
of
European
*NL*
reputation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Badger
overheard
him
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
!
''
Mr.
Badger
replied
to
the
smile
,
``
I
was
observing
to
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
and
Miss
Summerson
that
you
had
had
two
former
*NL*
husbands
--
both
very
distinguished
men
.
And
they
found
it
,
as
people
*NL*
generally
do
,
difficult
to
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
barely
twenty
,
''
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
when
I
married
Captain
*NL*
Swosser
of
the
Royal
Navy
.
I
was
in
the
Mediterranean
with
him
;
I
am
*NL*
quite
a
sailor
.
On
the
twelfth
anniversary
of
my
wedding-day
,
I
*NL*
became
the
wife
of
Professor
Dingo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
European
reputation
,
''
added
Mr.
Badger
in
an
undertone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
Mr.
Badger
and
myself
were
married
,
''
pursued
Mrs.
Badger
,
*NL*
``
we
were
married
on
the
same
day
of
the
year
.
I
had
become
attached
*NL*
to
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
Mrs.
Badger
has
been
married
to
three
husbands
--
two
of
them
*NL*
highly
distinguished
men
,
''
said
Mr.
Badger
,
summing
up
the
facts
,
*NL*
``
and
each
time
upon
the
twenty-first
of
March
at
eleven
in
the
*NL*
forenoon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
expressed
our
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
Mr.
Badger
's
modesty
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
I
would
take
*NL*
leave
to
correct
him
and
say
three
distinguished
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
!
What
I
always
tell
him
!
''
observed
Mrs.
*NL*
Badger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Badger
,
``
what
do
I
always
tell
you
?
That
*NL*
without
any
affectation
of
disparaging
such
professional
distinction
*NL*
as
I
may
have
attained
-LRB-
which
our
friend
Mr.
Carstone
will
have
many
*NL*
opportunities
of
estimating
-RRB-
,
I
am
not
so
weak
--
no
,
really
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Badger
to
us
generally
,
``
so
unreasonable
--
as
to
put
my
reputation
on
*NL*
the
same
footing
with
such
first-rate
men
as
Captain
Swosser
and
*NL*
Professor
Dingo
.
Perhaps
you
may
be
interested
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
*NL*
continued
Mr.
Bayham
Badger
,
leading
the
way
into
the
next
*NL*
drawing-room
,
``
in
this
portrait
of
Captain
Swosser

It
was
taken
on
*NL*
his
return
home
from
the
African
station
,
where
he
had
suffered
from
*NL*
the
fever
of
the
country
.
Mrs.
Badger
considers
it
too
yellow
.
But
*NL*
it
's
a
very
fine
head
.
A
very
fine
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
echoed
,
``
A
very
fine
head

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
when
I
look
at
it

''
said
Mr.
Badger
,
''
`
That
's
a
man
I
should
*NL*
like
to
have
seen
!
'
It
strikingly
bespeaks
the
first-class
man
that
*NL*
Captain
Swosser
pre-eminently
was
.
On
the
other
side
,
Professor
*NL*
Dingo
.
I
knew
him
well

attended
him
in
his
last
illness

*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
now
announced
,
and
we
went
downstairs
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
genteel
entertainment
,
very
handsomely
served
.
But
the
captain
and
*NL*
the
professor
still
ran
in
Mr.
Badger
's
head
,
and
as
Ada
and
I
had
*NL*
the
honour
of
being
under
his
particular
care
,
we
had
the
full
*NL*
benefit
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water

Allow

Bring

goblet

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
very
much
admired
some
artificial
flowers
under
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Astonishing
how
they
keep

''
said
Mr.
Badger
.
``
They
were
presented
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
when
she
was
in
the
Mediterranean

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
invited
Mr.
Jarndyce
to
take
a
glass
of
claret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
claret

''
he
said
.
``
Excuse
me

This
is
an
occasion

an

-RRB-
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
this
is
a
wine

was
imported
by
the
captain

we
will
not
say
how
many
years
ago

You
*NL*
will
find
it
very
curious

I
shall
be
happy

take
some
of

*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
when
we
ladies
retired
,
we
took
Mrs.
Badger
's
first
and
*NL*
second
husband
with
us
.
Mrs.
Badger
gave
us
in
the
drawing-room
a
*NL*
biographical
sketch
of
the
life
and
services
of
Captain
Swosser
*NL*
before
his
marriage
and
a
more
minute
account
of
him
dating
from
the
*NL*
time
when
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
a
ball
on
board
the
Crippler
,
*NL*
given
to
the
officers
of
that
ship
when
she
lay
in
Plymouth
Harbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dear
old
Crippler
!
''
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
She
was
*NL*
a
noble
vessel
.
Trim
,
ship-shape
,
all
a
taunto
,
as
Captain
Swosser
*NL*
used
to
say
.
You
must
excuse
me
if
I
occasionally
introduce
a
*NL*
nautical
expression
;
I
was
quite
a
sailor
once
.
Captain
Swosser
loved
*NL*
that
craft
for
my
sake
.
When
she
was
no
longer
in
commission
,
he
*NL*
frequently
said
that
if
he
were
rich
enough
to
buy
her
old
hulk
,
he
*NL*
would
have
an
inscription
let
into
the
timbers
of
the
quarter-deck
*NL*
where
we
stood
as
partners
in
the
dance
to
mark
the
spot
where
he
*NL*
fell
--
raked
fore
and
aft
-LRB-
Captain
Swosser
used
to
say
-RRB-
by
the
fire
*NL*
from
my
tops
.
It
was
his
naval
way
of
mentioning
my
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Badger
shook
her
head
,
sighed
,
and
looked
in
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
great
change
from
Captain
Swosser
to
Professor
Dingo
,
''
she
*NL*
resumed
with
a
plaintive
smile
.
``
I
felt
it
a
good
deal
at
first
.
Such
*NL*
an
entire
revolution
in
my
mode
of
life
!
But
custom
,
combined
with
*NL*
science
--
particularly
science
--
inured
me
to
it
.
Being
the
professor
's
*NL*
sole
companion
in
his
botanical
excursions
,
I
almost
forgot
that
I
*NL*
had
ever
been
afloat
,
and
became
quite
learned
.
It
is
singular
that
*NL*
the
professor
was
the
antipodes
of
Captain
Swosser
and
that
Mr.
*NL*
Badger
is
not
in
the
least
like
either
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
then
passed
into
a
narrative
of
the
deaths
of
Captain
Swosser
and
*NL*
Professor
Dingo
,
both
of
whom
seem
to
have
had
very
bad
complaints
.
*NL*
In
the
course
of
it
,
Mrs.
Badger
signified
to
us
that
she
had
never
*NL*
madly
loved
but
once
and
that
the
object
of
that
wild
affection
,
*NL*
never
to
be
recalled
in
its
fresh
enthusiasm
,
was
Captain
Swosser
.
*NL*
The
professor
was
yet
dying
by
inches
in
the
most
dismal
manner
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Badger
was
giving
us
imitations
of
his
way
of
saying
,
with
great
*NL*
difficulty
,
``
Where
is
Laura
?
Let
Laura
give
me
my
toast
and
water
!
''
*NL*
when
the
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
consigned
him
to
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
observed
that
evening
,
as
I
had
observed
for
some
days
past
,
*NL*
that
Ada
and
Richard
were
more
than
ever
attached
to
each
other
's
*NL*
society
,
which
was
but
natural
,
seeing
that
they
were
going
to
be
*NL*
separated
so
soon
.
I
was
therefore
not
very
much
surprised
when
we
*NL*
got
home
,
and
Ada
and
I
retired
upstairs
,
to
find
Ada
more
silent
*NL*
than
usual
,
though
I
was
not
quite
prepared
for
her
coming
into
my
*NL*
arms
and
beginning
to
speak
to
me
,
with
her
face
hidden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
Esther
!
''
murmured
Ada
.
``
I
have
a
great
secret
to
tell
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
mighty
secret
,
my
pretty
one
,
no
doubt
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Ada
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Esther
,
you
would
never
guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
try
to
guess
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
Do
n't
!
Pray
do
n't
!
''
cried
Ada
,
very
much
startled
by
the
*NL*
idea
of
my
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
wonder
who
it
can
be
about
?
''
said
I
,
pretending
to
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
about
--
''
said
Ada
in
a
whisper
.
``
It
's
about
--
my
cousin
*NL*
Richard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
own
!
''
said
I
,
kissing
her
bright
hair
,
which
was
all
I
*NL*
could
see
.
``
And
what
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Esther
,
you
would
never
guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
pretty
to
have
her
clinging
to
me
in
that
way
,
hiding
her
*NL*
face
,
and
to
know
that
she
was
not
crying
in
sorrow
but
in
a
little
*NL*
glow
of
joy
,
and
pride
,
and
hope
,
that
I
would
not
help
her
just
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
--
I
know
it
's
very
foolish
,
we
are
both
so
young
--
but
he
*NL*
says
,
''
with
a
burst
of
tears
,
``
that
he
loves
me
dearly
,
Esther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
indeed
?
''
said
I.
``
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
Why
,
my
pet
*NL*
of
pets
,
I
could
have
told
you
that
weeks
and
weeks
ago
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
see
Ada
lift
up
her
flushed
face
in
joyful
surprise
,
and
hold
me
*NL*
round
the
neck
,
and
laugh
,
and
cry
,
and
blush
,
was
so
pleasant
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
darling
,
''
said
I
,
``
what
a
goose
you
must
take
me
for
!
Your
*NL*
cousin
Richard
has
been
loving
you
as
plainly
as
he
could
for
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
long
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
!
''
cried
Ada
,
kissing
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
love
,
''
said
I.
``
I
waited
to
be
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
I
have
told
you
,
you
do
n't
think
it
wrong
of
me
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
returned
Ada
.
She
might
have
coaxed
me
to
say
no
if
I
had
been
the
*NL*
hardest-hearted
duenna
in
the
world
.
Not
being
that
yet
,
I
said
no
*NL*
very
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
know
the
worst
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
not
quite
the
worst
of
it
,
Esther
dear
!
''
cried
Ada
,
*NL*
holding
me
tighter
and
laying
down
her
face
again
upon
my
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
said
I.
``
Not
even
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
even
that
!
''
said
Ada
,
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
never
mean
to
say
--
''
I
was
beginning
in
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Ada
,
looking
up
and
smiling
through
her
tears
,
cried
,
``
Yes
,
I
do
!
*NL*
You
know
,
you
know
I
do
!
''
And
then
sobbed
out
,
``
With
all
my
heart
I
*NL*
do
!
With
all
my
whole
heart
,
Esther
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
,
laughing
,
why
I
had
known
that
,
too
,
just
as
well
as
I
*NL*
had
known
the
other
!
And
we
sat
before
the
fire
,
and
I
had
all
the
*NL*
talking
to
myself
for
a
little
while
-LRB-
though
there
was
not
much
of
*NL*
it
-RRB-
;
and
Ada
was
soon
quiet
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
my
cousin
John
knows
,
dear
Dame
Durden
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
my
cousin
John
is
blind
,
my
pet
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
should
think
my
*NL*
cousin
John
knows
pretty
well
as
much
as
we
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
want
to
speak
to
him
before
Richard
goes
,
''
said
Ada
timidly
,
``
and
*NL*
we
wanted
you
to
advise
us
,
and
to
tell
him
so
.
Perhaps
you
would
n't
*NL*
mind
Richard
's
coming
in
,
Dame
Durden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Richard
is
outside
,
is
he
,
my
dear
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
quite
certain
,
''
returned
Ada
with
a
bashful
simplicity
that
*NL*
would
have
won
my
heart
if
she
had
not
won
it
long
before
,
``
but
I
*NL*
think
he
's
waiting
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
was
,
of
course
.
They
brought
a
chair
on
either
side
of
me
,
*NL*
and
put
me
between
them
,
and
really
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
love
*NL*
with
me
instead
of
one
another
,
they
were
so
confiding
,
and
so
*NL*
trustful
,
and
so
fond
of
me
.
They
went
on
in
their
own
wild
way
for
a
*NL*
little
while
--
I
never
stopped
them
;
I
enjoyed
it
too
much
myself
--
and
*NL*
then
we
gradually
fell
to
considering
how
young
they
were
,
and
how
*NL*
there
must
be
a
lapse
of
several
years
before
this
early
love
could
*NL*
come
to
anything
,
and
how
it
could
come
to
happiness
only
if
it
were
*NL*
real
and
lasting
and
inspired
them
with
a
steady
resolution
to
do
*NL*
their
duty
to
each
other
,
with
constancy
,
fortitude
,
and
*NL*
perseverance
,
each
always
for
the
other
's
sake
.
Well
!
Richard
said
*NL*
that
he
would
work
his
fingers
to
the
bone
for
Ada
,
and
Ada
said
that
*NL*
she
would
work
her
fingers
to
the
bone
for
Richard
,
and
they
called
*NL*
me
all
sorts
of
endearing
and
sensible
names
,
and
we
sat
there
,
*NL*
advising
and
talking
,
half
the
night
.
Finally
,
before
we
parted
,
I
*NL*
gave
them
my
promise
to
speak
to
their
cousin
John
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
when
to-morrow
came
,
I
went
to
my
guardian
after
breakfast
,
in
*NL*
the
room
that
was
our
town-substitute
for
the
growlery
,
and
told
him
*NL*
that
I
had
it
in
trust
to
tell
him
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
little
woman
,
''
said
he
,
shutting
up
his
book
,
``
if
you
have
*NL*
accepted
the
trust
,
there
can
be
no
harm
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
guardian
,
''
said
I.
``
I
can
guarantee
that
there
is
no
*NL*
secrecy
in
it
.
For
it
only
happened
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
?
And
what
is
it
,
Esther
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
remember
the
happy
night
when
first
we
came
*NL*
down
to
Bleak
House
?
When
Ada
was
singing
in
the
dark
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wished
to
call
to
his
remembrance
the
look
he
had
given
me
then
.
*NL*
Unless
I
am
much
mistaken
,
I
saw
that
I
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
''
said
I
with
a
little
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
!
''
said
he
.
``
Do
n't
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
I
,
``
Ada
and
Richard
have
fallen
in
love
.
And
have
*NL*
told
each
other
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already
!
''
cried
my
guardian
,
quite
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
said
I.
``
And
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
guardian
,
I
rather
*NL*
expected
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
you
did
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
considering
for
a
minute
or
two
,
with
his
smile
,
at
once
so
*NL*
handsome
and
so
kind
,
upon
his
changing
face
,
and
then
requested
me
*NL*
to
let
them
know
that
he
wished
to
see
them
.
When
they
came
,
he
*NL*
encircled
Ada
with
one
arm
in
his
fatherly
way
and
addressed
himself
*NL*
to
Richard
with
a
cheerful
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rick
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
I
am
glad
to
have
won
your
confidence
.
I
*NL*
hope
to
preserve
it
.
When
I
contemplated
these
relations
between
us
*NL*
four
which
have
so
brightened
my
life
and
so
invested
it
with
new
*NL*
interests
and
pleasures
,
I
certainly
did
contemplate
,
afar
off
,
the
*NL*
possibility
of
you
and
your
pretty
cousin
here
-LRB-
do
n't
be
shy
,
Ada
,
*NL*
do
n't
be
shy
,
my
dear
!
-RRB-
being
in
a
mind
to
go
through
life
together
.
*NL*
I
saw
,
and
do
see
,
many
reasons
to
make
it
desirable
.
But
that
was
*NL*
afar
off
,
Rick
,
afar
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
look
afar
off
,
sir
,
''
returned
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
That
's
rational
.
Now
,
hear
me
,
my
dears
!
*NL*
I
might
tell
you
that
you
do
n't
know
your
own
minds
yet
,
that
a
*NL*
thousand
things
may
happen
to
divert
you
from
one
another
,
that
it
is
*NL*
well
this
chain
of
flowers
you
have
taken
up
is
very
easily
broken
,
*NL*
or
it
might
become
a
chain
of
lead
.
But
I
will
not
do
that
.
Such
*NL*
wisdom
will
come
soon
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
if
it
is
to
come
at
all
.
I
*NL*
will
assume
that
a
few
years
hence
you
will
be
in
your
hearts
to
one
*NL*
another
what
you
are
to-day
.
All
I
say
before
speaking
to
you
*NL*
according
to
that
assumption
is
,
if
you
DO
change
--
if
you
DO
come
to
*NL*
find
that
you
are
more
commonplace
cousins
to
each
other
as
man
and
*NL*
woman
than
you
were
as
boy
and
girl
-LRB-
your
manhood
will
excuse
me
,
*NL*
Rick
!
-RRB-
--
do
n't
be
ashamed
still
to
confide
in
me
,
for
there
will
be
*NL*
nothing
monstrous
or
uncommon
in
it
.
I
am
only
your
friend
and
*NL*
distant
kinsman
.
I
have
no
power
over
you
whatever
.
But
I
wish
and
*NL*
hope
to
retain
your
confidence
if
I
do
nothing
to
forfeit
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sure
,
sir
,
''
returned
Richard
,
``
that
I
speak
for
Ada
too
*NL*
when
I
say
that
you
have
the
strongest
power
over
us
both
--
rooted
in
*NL*
respect
,
gratitude
,
and
affection
--
strengthening
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
cousin
John
,
''
said
Ada
,
on
his
shoulder
,
``
my
father
's
place
can
*NL*
never
be
empty
again
.
All
the
love
and
duty
I
could
ever
have
*NL*
rendered
to
him
is
transferred
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
Now
for
our
assumption
.
Now
we
lift
our
*NL*
eyes
up
and
look
hopefully
at
the
distance
!
Rick
,
the
world
is
before
*NL*
you
;
and
it
is
most
probable
that
as
you
enter
it
,
so
it
will
receive
*NL*
you
.
Trust
in
nothing
but
in
Providence
and
your
own
efforts
.
Never
*NL*
separate
the
two
,
like
the
heathen
waggoner
.
Constancy
in
love
is
a
*NL*
good
thing
,
but
it
means
nothing
,
and
is
nothing
,
without
constancy
*NL*
in
every
kind
of
effort
.
If
you
had
the
abilities
of
all
the
great
*NL*
men
,
past
and
present
,
you
could
do
nothing
well
without
sincerely
*NL*
meaning
it
and
setting
about
it
.
If
you
entertain
the
supposition
*NL*
that
any
real
success
,
in
great
things
or
in
small
,
ever
was
or
could
*NL*
be
,
ever
will

can
be

wrested
from
Fortune
by
fits

starts
,
*NL*
leave
that
wrong
idea
here

leave
your
cousin
Ada
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
leave
IT
here
,
sir
,
''
replied
Richard
smiling
,
``
if
I
brought
*NL*
it
here
just
now
-LRB-
but
I
hope
I
did
not
-RRB-
,
and
will
work
my
way
on
to
*NL*
my
cousin
Ada
in
the
hopeful
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
!
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
If
you
are
not
to
make
her
happy
,
why
*NL*
should
you
pursue
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
make
her
unhappy
--
no
,
not
even
for
her
love
,
''
retorted
*NL*
Richard
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
!
''
cried
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
That
's
well
said
!
She
remains
here
,
*NL*
in
her
home
with
me
.
Love
her
,
Rick
,
in
your
active
life
,
no
less
*NL*
than
in
her
home
when
you
revisit
it
,
and
all
will
go
well
.
*NL*
Otherwise
,
all
will
go
ill
.
That
's
the
end
of
my
preaching
.
I
think
*NL*
you
and
Ada
had
better
take
a
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
tenderly
embraced
him
,
and
Richard
heartily
shook
hands
with
him
,
*NL*
and
then
the
cousins
went
out
of
the
room
,
looking
back
again
*NL*
directly
,
though
,
to
say
that
they
would
wait
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
stood
open
,
and
we
both
followed
them
with
our
eyes
as
they
*NL*
passed
down
the
adjoining
room
,
on
which
the
sun
was
shining
,
and
out
*NL*
at
its
farther
end
.
Richard
with
his
head
bent
,
and
her
hand
drawn
*NL*
through
his
arm
,
was
talking
to
her
very
earnestly
;
and
she
looked
up
*NL*
in
his
face
,
listening
,
and
seemed
to
see
nothing
else
.
So
young
,
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
so
full
of
hope
and
promise
,
they
went
on
lightly
through
*NL*
the
sunlight
as
their
own
happy
thoughts
might
then
be
traversing
the
*NL*
years
to
come
and
making
them
all
years
of
brightness
.
So
they
passed
*NL*
away
into
the
shadow
and
were
gone
.
It
was
only
a
burst
of
light
that
*NL*
had
been
so
radiant
.
The
room
darkened
as
they
went
out
,
and
the
sun
*NL*
was
clouded
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
right
,
Esther
?
''
said
my
guardian
when
they
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
good
and
wise
to
ask
ME
whether
he
was
right
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rick
may
gain
,
out
of
this
,
the
quality
he
wants
.
Wants
,
at
the
core
*NL*
of
so
much
that
is
good
!
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
I
*NL*
have
said
nothing
to
Ada
,
Esther
.
She
has
her
friend
and
counsellor
*NL*
always
near
.
''
And
he
laid
his
hand
lovingly
upon
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
showing
that
I
was
a
little
moved
,
though
I
did
all
*NL*
I
could
to
conceal
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
tut
!
''
said
he
.
``
But
we
must
take
care
,
too
,
that
our
little
*NL*
woman
's
life
is
not
all
consumed
in
care
for
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Care
?
My
dear
guardian
,
I
believe
I
am
the
happiest
creature
in
the
*NL*
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
too
,
''
said
he
.
``
But
some
one
may
find
out
what
Esther
*NL*
never
will
--
that
the
little
woman
is
to
be
held
in
remembrance
above
*NL*
all
other
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
omitted
to
mention
in
its
place
that
there
was
some
one
else
*NL*
at
the
family
dinner
party
.
It
was
not
a
lady
.
It
was
a
gentleman
.
It
*NL*
was
a
gentleman
of
a
dark
complexion
--
a
young
surgeon
.
He
was
rather
*NL*
reserved
,
but
I
thought
him
very
sensible
and
agreeable
.
At
least
,
*NL*
Ada
asked
me
if
I
did
not
,
and
I
said
yes

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Deportment
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
left
us
on
the
very
next
evening
to
begin
his
new
career
,
and
*NL*
committed
Ada
to
my
charge
with
great
love
for
her
and
great
trust
in
*NL*
me
.
It
touched
me
then
to
reflect
,
and
it
touches
me
now
,
more
*NL*
nearly
,
to
remember
-LRB-
having
what
I
have
to
tell
-RRB-
how
they
both
*NL*
thought
of
me
,
even
at
that
engrossing
time
.
I
was
a
part
of
all
*NL*
their
plans
,
for
the
present
and
the
future
.
I
was
to
write
Richard
*NL*
once
a
week
,
making
my
faithful
report
of
Ada
,
who
was
to
write
to
*NL*
him
every
alternate
day
.
I
was
to
be
informed
,
under
his
own
hand
,
of
*NL*
all
his
labours
and
successes
;
I
was
to
observe
how
resolute
and
*NL*
persevering
he
would
be
;
I
was
to
be
Ada
's
bridesmaid
when
they
were
*NL*
married
;
I
was
to
live
with
them
afterwards
;
I
was
to
keep
all
the
*NL*
keys
of
their
house
;
I
was
to
be
made
happy
for
ever
and
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
the
suit
SHOULD
make
us
rich
,
Esther
--
which
it
may
,
you
*NL*
know
!
''
said
Richard
to
crown
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shade
crossed
Ada
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
Ada
,
''
asked
Richard
,
``
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
had
better
declare
us
poor
at
once
,
''
said
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
returned
Richard
,
``
but
at
all
events
,
*NL*
it
wo
n't
declare
anything
at
once
.
It
has
n't
declared
anything
in
*NL*
heaven
knows
how
many
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
true
,
''
said
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
,
''
urged
Richard
,
answering
what
her
look
suggested
rather
*NL*
than
her
words
,
``
the
longer
it
goes
on
,
dear
cousin
,
the
nearer
it
*NL*
must
be
to
a
settlement
one
way
or
other
.
Now
,
is
not
that
*NL*
reasonable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
,
Richard
.
But
I
am
afraid
if
we
trust
to
it
,
it
will
*NL*
make
us
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
Ada
,
we
are
not
going
to
trust
to
it
!
''
cried
Richard
gaily
.
*NL*
``
We
know
it
better
than
to
trust
to
it
.
We
only
say
that
if
it
SHOULD
*NL*
make
us
rich
,
we
have
no
constitutional
objection
to
being
rich
.
The
*NL*
court
is
,
by
solemn
settlement
of
law
,
our
grim
old
guardian
,
and
we
*NL*
are
to
suppose
that
what
it
gives
us
-LRB-
when
it
gives
us
anything
-RRB-
is
*NL*
our
right
.
It
is
not
necessary
to
quarrel
with
our
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Ada
,
``
but
it
may
be
better
to
forget
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
cried
Richard
,
``
then
we
will
forget
all
about
it
!
We
*NL*
consign
the
whole
thing
to
oblivion
.
Dame
Durden
puts
on
her
*NL*
approving
face
,
and
it
's
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dame
Durden
's
approving
face
,
''
said
I
,
looking
out
of
the
box
in
*NL*
which
I
was
packing
his
books
,
``
was
not
very
visible
when
you
called
*NL*
it
by
that
name
;
but
it
does
approve
,
and
she
thinks
you
ca
n't
do
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Richard
said
there
was
an
end
of
it
,
and
immediately
began
,
on
no
*NL*
other
foundation
,
to
build
as
many
castles
in
the
air
as
would
man
*NL*
the
Great
Wall
of
China
.
He
went
away
in
high
spirits
.
Ada
and
I
,
*NL*
prepared
to
miss
him
very
much
,
commenced
our
quieter
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
arrival
in
London
,
we
had
called
with
Mr.
Jarndyce
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
's
but
had
not
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
her
at
home
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
she
had
gone
somewhere
to
a
tea-drinking
and
had
taken
*NL*
Miss
Jellyby
with
her
.
Besides
the
tea-drinking
,
there
was
to
be
some
*NL*
considerable
speech-making
and
letter-writing
on
the
general
merits
*NL*
of
the
cultivation
of
coffee
,
conjointly
with
natives
,
at
the
*NL*
Settlement
of
Borrioboola-Gha
.
All
this
involved
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
sufficient
active
exercise
of
pen
and
ink
to
make
her
daughter
's
part
*NL*
in
the
proceedings
anything
but
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
now
beyond
the
time
appointed
for
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
return
,
we
*NL*
called
again
.
She
was
in
town
,
but
not
at
home
,
having
gone
to
Mile
*NL*
End
directly
after
breakfast
on
some
Borrioboolan
business
,
arising
*NL*
out
of
a
society
called
the
East
London
Branch
Aid
Ramification
.
As
I
*NL*
had
not
seen
Peepy
on
the
occasion
of
our
last
call
-LRB-
when
he
was
not
*NL*
to
be
found
anywhere
,
and
when
the
cook
rather
thought
he
must
have
*NL*
strolled
away
with
the
dustman
's
cart
-RRB-
,
I
now
inquired
for
him
again
.
*NL*
The
oyster
shells
he
had
been
building
a
house
with
were
still
in
the
*NL*
passage
,
but
he
was
nowhere
discoverable
,
and
the
cook
supposed
that
*NL*
he
had
``
gone
after
the
sheep
.
''
When
we
repeated
,
with
some
surprise
,
*NL*
``
The
sheep
?
''
she
said
,
Oh
,
yes
,
on
market
days
he
sometimes
followed
*NL*
them
quite
out
of
town
and
came
back
in
such
a
state
as
never
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
my
guardian
on
the
following
*NL*
morning
,
and
Ada
was
busy
writing
--
of
course
to
Richard
--
when
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
was
announced
,
and
entered
,
leading
the
identical
Peepy
,
whom
*NL*
she
had
made
some
endeavours
to
render
presentable
by
wiping
the
dirt
*NL*
into
corners
of
his
face
and
hands
and
making
his
hair
very
wet
and
*NL*
then
violently
frizzling
it
with
her
fingers
.
Everything
the
dear
*NL*
child
wore
was
either
too
large
for
him
or
too
small
.
Among
his
other
*NL*
contradictory
decorations
he
had
the
hat
of
a
bishop
and
the
little
*NL*
gloves
of
a
baby
.
His
boots
were
,
on
a
small
scale
,
the
boots
of
a
*NL*
ploughman
,
while
his
legs
,
so
crossed
and
recrossed
with
scratches
*NL*
that
they
looked
like
maps
,
were
bare
below
a
very
short
pair
of
*NL*
plaid
drawers
finished
off
with
two
frills
of
perfectly
different
*NL*
patterns
.
The
deficient
buttons
on
his
plaid
frock
had
evidently
been
*NL*
supplied
from
one
of
Mr.
Jellyby
's
coats
,
they
were
so
extremely
*NL*
brazen
and
so
much
too
large
.
Most
extraordinary
specimens
of
*NL*
needlework
appeared
on
several
parts
of
his
dress
,
where
it
had
been
*NL*
hastily
mended
,
and
I
recognized
the
same
hand
on
Miss
Jellyby
's
.
She
*NL*
was
,
however
,
unaccountably
improved
in
her
appearance
and
looked
*NL*
very
pretty
.
She
was
conscious
of
poor
little
Peepy
being
but
a
*NL*
failure
after
all
her
trouble
,
and
she
showed
it
as
she
came
in
by
*NL*
the
way
in
which
she
glanced
first
at
him
and
then
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
!
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
Due
east
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
and
I
gave
her
a
cordial
welcome
and
presented
her
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
to
whom
she
said
as
she
sat
down
,
``
Ma
's
compliments
,
and
*NL*
she
hopes
you
'll
excuse
her
,
because
she
's
correcting
proofs
of
the
*NL*
plan
.
She
's
going
to
put
out
five
thousand
new
circulars
,
and
she
*NL*
knows
you
'll
be
interested
to
hear
that
.
I
have
brought
one
of
them
*NL*
with
me
.
Ma
's
compliments
.
''
With
which
she
presented
it
sulkily
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
*NL*
Oh
,
dear
me
!
This
is
a
very
trying
wind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
busy
with
Peepy
,
taking
off
his
clerical
hat
,
asking
him
if
*NL*
he
remembered
us
,
and
so
on
.
Peepy
retired
behind
his
elbow
at
first
,
*NL*
but
relented
at
the
sight
of
sponge-cake
and
allowed
me
to
take
him
*NL*
on
my
lap
,
where
he
sat
munching
quietly
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
then
*NL*
withdrawing
into
the
temporary
growlery
,
Miss
Jellyby
opened
a
*NL*
conversation
with
her
usual
abruptness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
on
just
as
bad
as
ever
in
Thavies
Inn
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
*NL*
have
no
peace
of
my
life
.
Talk
of
Africa
!
I
could
n't
be
worse
off
if
*NL*
I
was
a
what
's
-
his-name
--
man
and
a
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
say
something
soothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
of
no
use
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
exclaimed
Miss
Jellyby
,
``
though
*NL*
I
thank
you
for
the
kind
intention
all
the
same
.
I
know
how
I
am
*NL*
used
,
and
I
am
not
to
be
talked
over
.
YOU
would
n't
be
talked
over
if
*NL*
you
were
used
so
.
Peepy
,
go
and
play
at
Wild
Beasts
under
the
piano
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
!
''
said
Peepy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
you
ungrateful
,
naughty
,
hard-hearted
boy
!
''
returned
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
``
I
'll
never
take
pains
to
dress
you
*NL*
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
go
,
Caddy
!
''
cried
Peepy
,
who
was
really
a
good
child
and
*NL*
who
was
so
moved
by
his
sister
's
vexation
that
he
went
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
a
little
thing
to
cry
about
,
''
said
poor
Miss
Jellyby
*NL*
apologetically
,
``
but
I
am
quite
worn
out
.
I
was
directing
the
new
*NL*
circulars
till
two
this
morning
.
I
detest
the
whole
thing
so
that
*NL*
that
alone
makes
my
head
ache
till
I
ca
n't
see
out
of
my
eyes
.
And
*NL*
look
at
that
poor
unfortunate
child
!
Was
there
ever
such
a
fright
as
*NL*
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peepy
,
happily
unconscious
of
the
defects
in
his
appearance
,
sat
on
*NL*
the
carpet
behind
one
of
the
legs
of
the
piano
,
looking
calmly
out
of
*NL*
his
den
at
us
while
he
ate
his
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sent
him
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
''
observed
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
,
drawing
her
chair
nearer
ours
,
``
because
I
do
n't
want
him
to
*NL*
hear
the
conversation
.
Those
little
things
are
so
sharp
!
I
was
going
*NL*
to
say
,
we
really
are
going
on
worse
than
ever
.
Pa
will
be
a
bankrupt
*NL*
before
long
,
and
then
I
hope
Ma
will
be
satisfied
.
There
'll
he
nobody
*NL*
but
Ma
to
thank
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
we
hoped
Mr.
Jellyby
's
affairs
were
not
in
so
bad
a
state
as
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
of
no
use
hoping
,
though
it
's
very
kind
of
you
,
''
returned
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
Pa
told
me
only
yesterday
morning
-LRB-
and
*NL*
dreadfully
unhappy
he
is
-RRB-
that
he
could
n't
weather
the
storm
.
I
*NL*
should
be
surprised
if
he
could
.
When
all
our
tradesmen
send
into
our
*NL*
house
any
stuff
they
like
,
and
the
servants
do
what
they
like
with
*NL*
it
,
and
I
have
no
time
to
improve
things
if
I
knew
how
,
and
Ma
do
n't
*NL*
care
about
anything
,
I
should
like
to
make
out
how
Pa
is
to
weather
*NL*
the
storm

I
declare
if
I
was
Pa
,
I
'd
run
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
said
I
,
smiling
.
``
Your
papa
,
no
doubt
,
considers
his
*NL*
family

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
his
family
is
all
very
fine
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
replied
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
;
``
but
what
comfort
is
his
family
to
him
?
His
family
is
*NL*
nothing
but
bills
,
dirt
,
waste
,
noise
,
tumbles
downstairs
,
confusion
,
*NL*
and
wretchedness
.
His
scrambling
home
,
from
week
's
end
to
week
's
end
,
*NL*
is
like
one
great
washing-day
--
only
nothing
's
washed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Jellyby
tapped
her
foot
upon
the
floor
and
wiped
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
pity
Pa
to
that
degree
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
am
so
angry
with
*NL*
Ma
that
I
ca
n't
find
words
to
express
myself
!
However
,
I
am
not
going
*NL*
to
bear
it
,
I
am
determined
.
I
wo
n't
be
a
slave
all
my
life
,
and
I
*NL*
wo
n't
submit
to
be
proposed
to
by
Mr.
Quale
.
A
pretty
thing
,
indeed
,
*NL*
to
marry
a
philanthropist
.
As
if
I
had
n't
had
enough
of
THAT
!
''
said
*NL*
poor
Miss
Jellyby
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
confess
that
I
could
not
help
feeling
rather
angry
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
myself
,
seeing
and
hearing
this
neglected
girl
and
knowing
*NL*
how
much
of
bitterly
satirical
truth
there
was
in
what
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
was
n't
that
we
had
been
intimate
when
you
stopped
at
our
*NL*
house
,
''
pursued
Miss
Jellyby
,
``
I
should
have
been
ashamed
to
come
*NL*
here
to-day
,
for
I
know
what
a
figure
I
must
seem
to
you
two
.
But
as
*NL*
it
is
,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
call
,
especially
as
I
am
not
likely
to
*NL*
see
you
again
the
next
time
you
come
to
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
this
with
such
great
significance
that
Ada
and
I
glanced
at
*NL*
one
another
,
foreseeing
something
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Miss
Jellyby
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
Not
at
all
likely
!
I
know
*NL*
I
may
trust
you
two

I
am
sure
you

betray
me

I
am
engaged

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
their
knowledge
at
home

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
good
gracious
me
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
she
returned
,
justifying
*NL*
herself
in
a
fretful
but
not
angry
manner
,
``
how
can
it
be
otherwise
?
*NL*
You
know
what
Ma
is
--
and
I
need
n't
make
poor
Pa
more
miserable
by
*NL*
telling
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
would
it
not
be
adding
to
his
unhappiness
to
marry
without
his
*NL*
knowledge
or
consent

my
dear

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Miss
Jellyby
,
softening
.
``
I
hope
not
.
I
should
try
to
make
*NL*
him
happy
and
comfortable
when
he
came
to
see
me
,
and
Peepy
and
the
*NL*
others
should
take
it
in
turns
to
come
and
stay
with
me
,
and
they
*NL*
should
have
some
care
taken
of
them
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
deal
of
affection
in
poor
Caddy
.
She
softened
more
*NL*
and
more
while
saying
this
and
cried
so
much
over
the
unwonted
little
*NL*
home-picture
she
had
raised
in
her
mind
that
Peepy
,
in
his
cave
under
*NL*
the
piano
,
was
touched
,
and
turned
himself
over
on
his
back
with
loud
*NL*
lamentations
.
It
was
not
until
I
had
brought
him
to
kiss
his
sister
,
*NL*
and
had
restored
him
to
his
place
on
my
lap
,
and
had
shown
him
that
*NL*
Caddy
was
laughing
-LRB-
she
laughed
expressly
for
the
purpose
-RRB-
,
that
we
*NL*
could
recall
his
peace
of
mind
;
even
then
it
was
for
some
time
*NL*
conditional
on
his
taking
us
in
turns
by
the
chin
and
smoothing
our
*NL*
faces
all
over
with
his
hand
.
At
last
,
as
his
spirits
were
not
equal
*NL*
to
the
piano
,
we
put
him
on
a
chair
to
look
out
of
window
;
and
Miss
*NL*
Jellyby
,
holding
him
by
one
leg
,
resumed
her
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
began
in
your
coming
to
our
house
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
naturally
asked
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
I
was
so
awkward
,
''
she
replied
,
``
that
I
made
up
my
mind
to
be
*NL*
improved
in
that
respect
at
all
events
and
to
learn
to
dance
.
I
told
*NL*
Ma
I
was
ashamed
of
myself
,
and
I
must
be
taught
to
dance
.
Ma
looked
*NL*
at
me
in
that
provoking
way
of
hers
as
if
I
was
n't
in
sight
,
but
I
*NL*
was
quite
determined
to
be
taught
to
dance
,
and
so
I
went
to
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
's
Academy
in
Newman
Street
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
it
there

I
began

*NL*
``
Yes

it

there

said
Caddy

I

My
Mr.
Turveydrop

the

I
only
wish
I
had
been
better
brought
up

make
him
a

very
fond

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
this

said
I
,
``
I
must
confess

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
be
sorry

she
retorted
a
little
*NL*
anxiously
,
``
but
I
am
engaged
to
Mr.

is
very
fond
of
me
.
It
's
a
secret
as
yet
,
even
on
his
side
,
because
*NL*
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
has
a
share
in
the
connexion
and
it
might
break
*NL*
his
heart
or
give
him
some
other
shock
if
he
was
told
of
it
abruptly
.
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Turveydrop
is
a
very
gentlemanly
man
indeed
--
very
*NL*
gentlemanly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
his
wife
know
of
it
?
''
asked
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
wife
,
Miss
Clare
?
''
returned
Miss
Jellyby
,
*NL*
opening
her
eyes
.
``
There
's
no
such
person
.
He
is
a
widower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
here
interrupted
by
Peepy
,
whose
leg
had
undergone
so
much
on
*NL*
account
of
his
sister
's
unconsciously
jerking
it
like
a
bell-rope
*NL*
whenever
she
was
emphatic
that
the
afflicted
child
now
bemoaned
his
*NL*
sufferings
with
a
very
low-spirited
noise
.
As
he
appealed
to
me
for
*NL*
compassion
,
and
as
I
was
only
a
listener
,
I
undertook
to
hold
him
.
*NL*
Miss
Jellyby
proceeded
,
after
begging
Peepy
's
pardon
with
a
kiss
and
*NL*
assuring
him
that
she
had
n't
meant
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
state
of
the
case
,
''
said
Caddy
.
``
If
I
ever
blame
myself
,
*NL*
I
still
think
it
's
Ma
's
fault
.
We
are
to
be
married
whenever
we
can
,
*NL*
and
then
I
shall
go
to
Pa
at
the
office
and
write
to
Ma
.
It
wo
n't
*NL*
much
agitate
Ma
;
I
am
only
pen
and
ink
to
HER
.
One
great
comfort
is
,
''
*NL*
said
Caddy
with
a
sob
,
``
that
I
shall
never
hear
of
Africa
after
I
am
*NL*
married
.
Young
Mr.
Turveydrop
hates
it
for
my
sake
,
and
if
old
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
knows
there
is
such
a
place
,
it
's
as
much
as
he
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
he
who
was
very
gentlemanly
,
I
think
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
gentlemanly
indeed
,
''
said
Caddy
.
``
He
is
celebrated
almost
*NL*
everywhere
for
his
deportment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
teach
?
''
asked
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
do
n't
teach
anything
in
particular
,
''
replied
Caddy
.
``
But
his
*NL*
deportment
is
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
went
on
to
say
with
considerable
hesitation
and
reluctance
that
*NL*
there
was
one
thing
more
she
wished
us
to
know
,
and
felt
we
ought
to
*NL*
know
,
and
which
she
hoped
would
not
offend
us
.
It
was
that
she
had
*NL*
improved
her
acquaintance
with
Miss
Flite
,
the
little
crazy
old
lady
,
*NL*
and
that
she
frequently
went
there
early
in
the
morning
and
met
her
*NL*
lover
for
a
few
minutes
before
breakfast
--
only
for
a
few
minutes
.
``
I
*NL*
go
there
at
other
times
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
but
Prince
does
not
come
then
.
*NL*
Young
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
name
is
Prince
;
I
wish
it
was
n't
,
because
it
*NL*
sounds
like
a
dog
,
but
of
course
he
did
n't
christen
himself
.
Old
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
had
him
christened
Prince
in
remembrance
of
the
Prince
*NL*
Regent
.
Old
Mr.
Turveydrop
adored
the
Prince
Regent
on
account
of
his
*NL*
deportment
.
I
hope
you
wo
n't
think
the
worse
of
me
for
having
made
*NL*
these
little
appointments
at
Miss
Flite
's
,
where
I
first
went
with
*NL*
you
,
because
I
like
the
poor
thing
for
her
own
sake
and
I
believe
she
*NL*
likes
me
.
If
you
could
see
young
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
I
am
sure
you
would
*NL*
think
well
of
him
--
at
least
,
I
am
sure
you
could
n't
possibly
think
*NL*
any
ill
of
him
.
I
am
going
there
now
for
my
lesson
.
I
could
n't
ask
*NL*
you
to
go
with
me
,
Miss
Summerson
;
but
if
you
would
,
''
said
Caddy
,
who
*NL*
had
said
all
this
earnestly
and
tremblingly
,
``
I
should
be
very
*NL*
glad
--
very
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
we
had
arranged
with
my
guardian
to
go
to
Miss
*NL*
Flite
's
that
day
.
We
had
told
him
of
our
former
visit
,
and
our
*NL*
account
had
interested
him
;
but
something
had
always
happened
to
*NL*
prevent
our
going
there
again
.
As
I
trusted
that
I
might
have
*NL*
sufficient
influence
with
Miss
Jellyby
to
prevent
her
taking
any
very
*NL*
rash
step
if
I
fully
accepted
the
confidence
she
was
so
willing
to
*NL*
place
in
me
,
poor
girl
,
I
proposed
that
she
and
I
and
Peepy
should
go
*NL*
to
the
academy
and
afterwards
meet
my
guardian
and
Ada
at
Miss
*NL*
Flite
's
,
whose
name
I
now
learnt
for
the
first
time
.
This
was
on
*NL*
condition
that
Miss
Jellyby
and
Peepy
should
come
back
with
us
to
*NL*
dinner
.
The
last
article
of
the
agreement
being
joyfully
acceded
to
*NL*
by
both
,
we
smartened
Peepy
up
a
little
with
the
assistance
of
a
few
*NL*
pins
,
some
soap
and
water
,
and
a
hair-brush
,
and
went
out
,
bending
*NL*
our
steps
towards
Newman
Street
,
which
was
very
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
the
academy
established
in
a
sufficiently
dingy
house
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
an
archway
,
with
busts
in
all
the
staircase
windows
.
In
the
*NL*
same
house
there
were
also
established
,
as
I
gathered
from
the
plates
*NL*
on
the
door
,
a
drawing-master
,
a
coal-merchant
-LRB-
there
was
,
certainly
,
*NL*
no
room
for
his
coals
-RRB-
,
and
a
lithographic
artist
.
On
the
plate
*NL*
which
,
in
size
and
situation
,
took
precedence
of
all
the
rest
,
I
*NL*
read
,
MR.
TURVEYDROP
.
The
door
was
open
,
and
the
hall
was
blocked
up
*NL*
by
a
grand
piano
,
a
harp
,
and
several
other
musical
instruments
in
*NL*
cases
,
all
in
progress
of
removal
,
and
all
looking
rakish
in
the
*NL*
daylight
.
Miss
Jellyby
informed
me
that
the
academy
had
been
lent
,
*NL*
last
night
,
for
a
concert
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
upstairs
--
it
had
been
quite
a
fine
house
once
,
when
it
was
*NL*
anybody
's
business
to
keep
it
clean
and
fresh
,
and
nobody
's
business
*NL*
to
smoke
in
it
all
day
--
and
into
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
great
room
,
which
*NL*
was
built
out
into
a
mews
at
the
back
and
was
lighted
by
a
skylight
.
*NL*
It
was
a
bare
,
resounding
room
smelling
of
stables
,
with
cane
forms
*NL*
along
the
walls
,
and
the
walls
ornamented
at
regular
intervals
with
*NL*
painted
lyres
and
little
cut-glass
branches
for
candles
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
be
shedding
their
old-fashioned
drops
as
other
branches
might
shed
*NL*
autumn
leaves
.
Several
young
lady
pupils
,
ranging
from
thirteen
or
*NL*
fourteen
years
of
age
to
two
or
three
and
twenty
,
were
assembled
;
and
*NL*
I
was
looking
among
them
for
their
instructor
when
Caddy
,
pinching
my
*NL*
arm
,
repeated
the
ceremony
of
introduction
.
``
Miss
Summerson
,
Mr.
*NL*
Prince
Turveydrop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
curtsied
to
a
little
blue-eyed
fair
man
of
youthful
appearance
with
*NL*
flaxen
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
curling
at
the
ends
all
round
*NL*
his
head
.
He
had
a
little
fiddle
,
which
we
used
to
call
at
school
a
*NL*
kit
,
under
his
left
arm
,
and
its
little
bow
in
the
same
hand
.
His
*NL*
little
dancing-shoes
were
particularly
diminutive
,
and
he
had
a
*NL*
little
innocent
,
feminine
manner
which
not
only
appealed
to
me
in
an
*NL*
amiable
way
,
but
made
this
singular
effect
upon
me
,
that
I
received
*NL*
the
impression
that
he
was
like
his
mother
and
that
his
mother
had
*NL*
not
been
much
considered
or
well
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
happy
to
see
Miss
Jellyby
's
friend
,
''
he
said
,
bowing
low
*NL*
to
me
.
``
I
began
to
fear
,
''
with
timid
tenderness
,
``
as
it
was
past
the
*NL*
usual
time
,
that
Miss
Jellyby
was
not
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
attribute
that
to
me
,
who
have
*NL*
detained
her
,
and
to
receive
my
excuses
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
,
''
I
entreated
,
``
do
not
allow
me
to
be
the
cause
of
any
more
*NL*
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
apology
I
withdrew
to
a
seat
between
Peepy
-LRB-
who
,
being
well
*NL*
used
to
it
,
had
already
climbed
into
a
corner
place
-RRB-
and
an
old
lady
*NL*
of
a
censorious
countenance
whose
two
nieces
were
in
the
class
and
*NL*
who
was
very
indignant
with
Peepy
's
boots
.
Prince
Turveydrop
then
*NL*
tinkled
the
strings
of
his
kit
with
his
fingers
,
and
the
young
ladies
*NL*
stood
up
to
dance
.
Just
then
there
appeared
from
a
side-door
old
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
,
in
the
full
lustre
of
his
deportment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
fat
old
gentleman
with
a
false
complexion
,
false
teeth
,
*NL*
false
whiskers
,
and
a
wig
.
He
had
a
fur
collar
,
and
he
had
a
padded
*NL*
breast
to
his
coat
,
which
only
wanted
a
star
or
a
broad
blue
ribbon
*NL*
to
be
complete
.
He
was
pinched
in
,
and
swelled
out
,
and
got
up
,
and
*NL*
strapped
down
,
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
bear
.
He
had
such
a
*NL*
neckcloth
on
-LRB-
puffing
his
very
eyes
out
of
their
natural
shape
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
his
chin
and
even
his
ears
so
sunk
into
it
,
that
it
seemed
as
though
*NL*
he
must
inevitably
double
up
if
it
were
cast
loose
.
He
had
under
his
*NL*
arm
a
hat
of
great
size
and
weight
,
shelving
downward
from
the
crown
*NL*
to
the
brim
,
and
in
his
hand
a
pair
of
white
gloves
with
which
he
*NL*
flapped
it
as
he
stood
poised
on
one
leg
in
a
high-shouldered
,
*NL*
round-elbowed
state
of
elegance
not
to
be
surpassed
.
He
had
a
cane
,
*NL*
he
had
an
eye-glass
,
he
had
a
snuff-box
,
he
had
rings
,
he
had
*NL*
wristbands
,
he
had
everything
but
any
touch
of
nature
;
he
was
not
*NL*
like
youth
,
he
was
not
like
age
,
he
was
not
like
anything
in
the
*NL*
world
but
a
model
of
deportment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
A
visitor
.
Miss
Jellyby
's
friend
,
Miss
Summerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Distinguished
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
by
Miss
Summerson
's
presence
.
''
*NL*
As
he
bowed
to
me
in
that
tight
state
,
I
almost
believe
I
saw
creases
*NL*
come
into
the
whites
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
''
said
the
son
,
aside
,
to
me
with
quite
an
affecting
*NL*
belief
in
him
,
``
is
a
celebrated
character
.
My
father
is
greatly
*NL*
admired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
Prince
!
Go
on
!
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
standing
with
his
back
*NL*
to
the
fire
and
waving
his
gloves
condescendingly
.
``
Go
on
,
my
son
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
command
,
or
by
this
gracious
permission
,
the
lesson
went
on
.
*NL*
Prince
Turveydrop
sometimes
played
the
kit
,
dancing
;
sometimes
played
*NL*
the
piano
,
standing
;
sometimes
hummed
the
tune
with
what
little
*NL*
breath
he
could
spare
,
while
he
set
a
pupil
right
;
always
*NL*
conscientiously
moved
with
the
least
proficient
through
every
step
*NL*
and
every
part
of
the
figure
;
and
never
rested
for
an
instant
.
His
*NL*
distinguished
father
did
nothing
whatever
but
stand
before
the
fire
,
*NL*
a
model
of
deportment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
never
does
anything
else
,
''
said
the
old
lady
of
the
*NL*
censorious
countenance
.
``
Yet
would
you
believe
that
it
's
HIS
name
on
*NL*
the
door-plate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
son
's
name
is
the
same
,
you
know
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
let
his
son
have
any
name
if
he
could
take
it
from
him
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
old
lady
.
``
Look
at
the
son
's
dress
!
''
It
certainly
was
*NL*
plain
--
threadbare
--
almost
shabby
.
``
Yet
the
father
must
be
garnished
*NL*
and
tricked
out
,
''
said
the
old
lady
,
``
because
of
his
deportment
.
I
'd
*NL*
deport
him
!
Transport
him
would
be
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
curious
to
know
more
concerning
this
person
.
I
asked
,
``
Does
he
*NL*
give
lessons
in
deportment
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
''
returned
the
old
lady
shortly
.
``
Never
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
consideration
,
I
suggested
that
perhaps
fencing
had
*NL*
been
his
accomplishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
he
can
fence
at
all
,
ma'am
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
surprised
and
inquisitive
.
The
old
lady
,
becoming
more
and
*NL*
more
incensed
against
the
master
of
deportment
as
she
dwelt
upon
the
*NL*
subject
,
gave
me
some
particulars
of
his
career
,
with
strong
*NL*
assurances
that
they
were
mildly
stated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
married
a
meek
little
dancing-mistress
,
with
a
tolerable
*NL*
connexion
-LRB-
having
never
in
his
life
before
done
anything
but
deport
*NL*
himself
-RRB-
,
and
had
worked
her
to
death
,
or
had
,
at
the
best
,
suffered
*NL*
her
to
work
herself
to
death
,
to
maintain
him
in
those
expenses
which
*NL*
were
indispensable
to
his
position
.
At
once
to
exhibit
his
deportment
*NL*
to
the
best
models
and
to
keep
the
best
models
constantly
before
*NL*
himself
,
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
frequent
all
public
places
of
*NL*
fashionable
and
lounging
resort
,
to
be
seen
at
Brighton
and
elsewhere
*NL*
at
fashionable
times
,
and
to
lead
an
idle
life
in
the
very
best
*NL*
clothes
.
To
enable
him
to
do
this
,
the
affectionate
little
*NL*
dancing-mistress
had
toiled
and
laboured
and
would
have
toiled
and
*NL*
laboured
to
that
hour
if
her
strength
had
lasted
so
long
.
For
the
*NL*
mainspring
of
the
story
was
that
in
spite
of
the
man
's
absorbing
*NL*
selfishness
,
his
wife
-LRB-
overpowered
by
his
deportment
-RRB-
had
,
to
the
*NL*
last
,
believed
in
him
and
had
,
on
her
death-bed
,
in
the
most
moving
*NL*
terms
,
confided
him
to
their
son
as
one
who
had
an
inextinguishable
*NL*
claim
upon
him
and
whom
he
could
never
regard
with
too
much
pride
and
*NL*
deference
.
The
son
,
inheriting
his
mother
's
belief
,
and
having
the
*NL*
deportment
always
before
him
,
had
lived
and
grown
in
the
same
faith
,
*NL*
and
now
,
at
thirty
years
of
age
,
worked
for
his
father
twelve
hours
a
*NL*
day
and
looked
up
to
him
with
veneration
on
the
old
imaginary
*NL*
pinnacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
airs
the
fellow
gives
himself
!
''
said
my
informant
,
shaking
her
*NL*
head
at
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
with
speechless
indignation
as
he
drew
on
*NL*
his
tight
gloves
,
of
course
unconscious
of
the
homage
she
was
*NL*
rendering
.
``
He
fully
believes
he
is
one
of
the
aristocracy
!
And
he
is
*NL*
so
condescending
to
the
son
he
so
egregiously
deludes
that
you
might
*NL*
suppose
him
the
most
virtuous
of
parents
.
Oh
!
''
said
the
old
lady
,
*NL*
apostrophizing
him
with
infinite
vehemence
.
``
I
could
bite
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
being
amused
,
though
I
heard
the
old
lady
out
with
*NL*
feelings
of
real
concern
.
It
was
difficult
to
doubt
her
with
the
*NL*
father
and
son
before
me
.
What
I
might
have
thought
of
them
without
*NL*
the
old
lady
's
account
,
or
what
I
might
have
thought
of
the
old
*NL*
lady
's
account
without
them
,
I
can
not
say
.
There
was
a
fitness
of
*NL*
things
in
the
whole
that
carried
conviction
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
eyes
were
yet
wandering
,
from
young
Mr.
Turveydrop
working
so
*NL*
hard
,
to
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
deporting
himself
so
beautifully
,
when
*NL*
the
latter
came
ambling
up
to
me
and
entered
into
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
me
,
first
of
all
,
whether
I
conferred
a
charm
and
a
*NL*
distinction
on
London
by
residing
in
it
?
I
did
not
think
it
necessary
*NL*
to
reply
that
I
was
perfectly
aware
I
should
not
do
that
,
in
any
*NL*
case
,
but
merely
told
him
where
I
did
reside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lady
so
graceful
and
accomplished
,
''
he
said
,
kissing
his
*NL*
right
glove
and
afterwards
extending
it
towards
the
pupils
,
*NL*
``
will
look
leniently
on
the
deficiencies
here
.
We
do
our
best
to
*NL*
polish
--
polish
--
polish
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
beside
me
,
taking
some
pains
to
sit
on
the
form
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
in
imitation
of
the
print
of
his
illustrious
model
on
the
*NL*
sofa
.
And
really
he
did
look
very
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
polish
--
polish
--
polish
!
''
he
repeated
,
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
*NL*
gently
fluttering
his
fingers
.
``
But
we
are
not
,
if
I
may
say
so
to
*NL*
one
formed
to
be
graceful
both
by
Nature
and
Art
--
''
with
the
*NL*
high-shouldered
bow
,
which
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
make
*NL*
without
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
and
shutting
his
eyes
''
--
we
are
not
*NL*
what
we
used
to
be
in
point
of
deportment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
not
,
sir
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
degenerated
,
''
he
returned
,
shaking
his
head
,
which
he
could
*NL*
do
to
a
very
limited
extent
in
his
cravat
.
``
A
levelling
age
is
not
*NL*
favourable
to
deportment
.
It
develops
vulgarity
.
Perhaps
I
speak
with
*NL*
some
little
partiality
.
It
may
not
be
for
me
to
say
that
I
have
been
*NL*
called
,
for
some
years
now
,
Gentleman
Turveydrop
,
or
that
his
Royal
*NL*
Highness
the
Prince
Regent
did
me
the
honour
to
inquire
,
on
my
*NL*
removing
my
hat
as
he
drove
out
of
the
Pavilion
at
Brighton
-LRB-
that
*NL*
fine
building
-RRB-
,
`
Who
is
he
?
Who
the
devil
is
he
?
Why
do
n't
I
know
*NL*
him
?
Why
has
n't
he
thirty
thousand
a
year
?
'
But
these
are
little
*NL*
matters
of
anecdote
--
the
general
property
,
ma'am
--
still
repeated
*NL*
occasionally
among
the
upper
classes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
with
the
high-shouldered
bow
.
``
Where
what
is
left
among
us
*NL*
of
deportment
,
''
he
added
,
``
still
lingers
.
England
--
alas
,
my
*NL*
country
!
--
has
degenerated
very
much
,
and
is
degenerating
every
day
.
*NL*
She
has
not
many
gentlemen
left
.
We
are
few
.
I
see
nothing
to
succeed
*NL*
us
but
a
race
of
weavers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
might
hope
that
the
race
of
gentlemen
would
be
perpetuated
*NL*
here
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
.
''
He
smiled
with
a
high-shouldered
bow
again
.
``
You
*NL*
flatter
me
.
But
,
no
--
no
!
I
have
never
been
able
to
imbue
my
poor
boy
*NL*
with
that
part
of
his
art
.
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
disparage
my
*NL*
dear
child
,
but
he
has
--
no
deportment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
appears
to
be
an
excellent
master

''
I
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
me

my
dear
madam

has
acquired
.
All
that
can

,
he
can
*NL*
impart
.
But
there
ARE
things
--
''
He
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
and
*NL*
made
the
bow
again
,
as
if
to
add
,
``
This
kind
of
thing
,
for
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
towards
the
centre
of
the
room
,
where
Miss
Jellyby
's
lover
,
*NL*
now
engaged
with
single
pupils
,
was
undergoing
greater
drudgery
than
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
amiable
child
,
''
murmured
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
adjusting
his
cravat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
son
is
indefatigable
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
reward
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
to
hear
you
say
so
.
In
some
*NL*
respects
,
he
treads
in
the
footsteps
of
his
sainted
mother
.
She
was
a
*NL*
devoted
creature
.
But
wooman
,
lovely
wooman
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
*NL*
with
very
disagreeable
gallantry
,
``
what
a
sex
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
and
joined
Miss
Jellyby
,
who
was
by
this
time
putting
on
her
*NL*
bonnet
.
The
time
allotted
to
a
lesson
having
fully
elapsed
,
there
was
*NL*
a
general
putting
on
of
bonnets
.
When
Miss
Jellyby
and
the
*NL*
unfortunate
Prince
found
an
opportunity
to
become
betrothed
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
but
they
certainly
found
none
on
this
occasion
to
exchange
a
*NL*
dozen
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
benignly
to
his
son
,
``
do
you
know
the
*NL*
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
father
.
''
The
son
had
no
watch
.
The
father
had
a
handsome
gold
*NL*
one
,
which
he
pulled
out
with
an
air
that
was
an
example
to
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
's
two
o'clock
.
Recollect
your
school
at
*NL*
Kensington
at
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
time
enough
for
me
,
father
,
''
said
Prince
.
``
I
can
take
a
*NL*
morsel
of
dinner
standing
and
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
boy
,
''
returned
his
father
,
``
you
must
be
very
quick
.
You
will
*NL*
find
the
cold
mutton
on
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
father
.
Are
YOU
off
now
,
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
.
I
suppose
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
shutting
his
eyes
and
*NL*
lifting
up
his
shoulders
with
modest
consciousness
,
``
that
I
must
show
*NL*
myself
,
as
usual
,
about
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
dine
out
comfortably
somewhere
,
''
said
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
I
intend
to
.
I
shall
take
my
little
meal
,
I
think
,
at
*NL*
the
French
house
,
in
the
Opera
Colonnade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
.
Good-bye
,
father
!
''
said
Prince
,
shaking
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
son
.
Bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Turveydrop
said
this
in
quite
a
pious
manner
,
and
it
seemed
to
do
*NL*
his
son
good
,
who
,
in
parting
from
him
,
was
so
pleased
with
him
,
so
*NL*
dutiful
to
him
,
and
so
proud
of
him
that
I
almost
felt
as
if
it
were
*NL*
an
unkindness
to
the
younger
man
not
to
be
able
to
believe
implicitly
*NL*
in
the
elder
.
The
few
moments
that
were
occupied
by
Prince
in
taking
*NL*
leave
of
us
-LRB-
and
particularly
of
one
of
us
,
as
I
saw
,
being
in
the
*NL*
secret
-RRB-
,
enhanced
my
favourable
impression
of
his
almost
childish
*NL*
character
.
I
felt
a
liking
for
him
and
a
compassion
for
him
as
he
put
*NL*
his
little
kit
in
his
pocket
--
and
with
it
his
desire
to
stay
a
little
*NL*
while
with
Caddy
--
and
went
away
good-humouredly
to
his
cold
mutton
*NL*
and
his
school
at
Kensington
,
that
made
me
scarcely
less
irate
with
*NL*
his
father
than
the
censorious
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
opened
the
room
door
for
us
and
bowed
us
out
in
a
manner
,
*NL*
I
must
acknowledge
,
worthy
of
his
shining
original
.
In
the
same
style
*NL*
he
presently
passed
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
on
his
way
to
*NL*
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
town
,
where
he
was
going
to
show
himself
*NL*
among
the
few
other
gentlemen
left
.
For
some
moments
,
I
was
so
lost
*NL*
in
reconsidering
what
I
had
heard
and
seen
in
Newman
Street
that
I
*NL*
was
quite
unable
to
talk
to
Caddy
or
even
to
fix
my
attention
on
what
*NL*
she
said
to
me
,
especially
when
I
began
to
inquire
in
my
mind
whether
*NL*
there
were
,
or
ever
had
been
,
any
other
gentlemen
,
not
in
the
dancing
*NL*
profession
,
who
lived
and
founded
a
reputation
entirely
on
their
*NL*
deportment
.
This
became
so
bewildering
and
suggested
the
possibility
*NL*
of
so
many
Mr.
Turveydrops
that
I
said
,
``
Esther
,
you
must
make
up
*NL*
your
mind
to
abandon
this
subject
altogether
and
attend
to
Caddy
.
''
I
*NL*
accordingly
did
so
,
and
we
chatted
all
the
rest
of
the
way
to
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
told
me
that
her
lover
's
education
had
been
so
neglected
that
*NL*
it
was
not
always
easy
to
read
his
notes
.
She
said
if
he
were
not
so
*NL*
anxious
about
his
spelling
and
took
less
pains
to
make
it
clear
,
he
*NL*
would
do
better
;
but
he
put
so
many
unnecessary
letters
into
short
*NL*
words
that
they
sometimes
quite
lost
their
English
appearance
.
``
He
*NL*
does
it
with
the
best
intention
,
''
observed
Caddy
,
``
but
it
has
n't
the
*NL*
effect
he
means
,
poor
fellow
!
''
Caddy
then
went
on
to
reason
,
how
*NL*
could
he
be
expected
to
be
a
scholar
when
he
had
passed
his
whole
*NL*
life
in
the
dancing-school
and
had
done
nothing
but
teach
and
fag
,
*NL*
fag
and
teach
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
!
And
what
did
it
matter
?
She
*NL*
could
write
letters
enough
for
both
,
as
she
knew
to
her
cost
,
and
it
*NL*
was
far
better
for
him
to
be
amiable
than
learned
.
``
Besides
,
it
's
not
*NL*
as
if
I
was
an
accomplished
girl
who
had
any
right
to
give
herself
*NL*
airs
,
''
said
Caddy
.
``
I
know
little
enough
,
I
am
sure
,
thanks
to
Ma
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
another
thing
I
want
to
tell
you
,
now
we
are
alone
,
''
*NL*
continued
Caddy
,
``
which
I
should
not
have
liked
to
mention
unless
you
*NL*
had
seen
Prince
,
Miss
Summerson
.
You
know
what
a
house
ours
is
.
It
's
*NL*
of
no
use
my
trying
to
learn
anything
that
it
would
be
useful
for
*NL*
Prince
's
wife
to
know
in
OUR
house
.
We
live
in
such
a
state
of
muddle
*NL*
that
it
's
impossible
,
and
I
have
only
been
more
disheartened
whenever
*NL*
I
have
tried
.
So
I
get
a
little
practice
with
--
who
do
you
think
?
Poor
*NL*
Miss
Flite
!
Early
in
the
morning
I
help
her
to
tidy
her
room
and
*NL*
clean
her
birds
,
and
I
make
her
cup
of
coffee
for
her
-LRB-
of
course
she
*NL*
taught
me
-RRB-
,
and
I
have
learnt
to
make
it
so
well
that
Prince
says
*NL*
it
's
the
very
best
coffee
he
ever
tasted
,
and
would
quite
delight
old
*NL*
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
who
is
very
particular
indeed
about
his
coffee
.
I
can
*NL*
make
little
puddings
too
;
and
I
know
how
to
buy
neck
of
mutton
,
and
*NL*
tea
,
and
sugar
,
and
butter
,
and
a
good
many
housekeeping
things
.
I
am
*NL*
not
clever
at
my
needle
,
yet
,
''
said
Caddy
,
glancing
at
the
repairs
on
*NL*
Peepy
's
frock
,
``
but
perhaps
I
shall
improve
,
and
since
I
have
been
*NL*
engaged
to
Prince
and
have
been
doing
all
this
,
I
have
felt
*NL*
better-tempered
,
I
hope
,
and
more
forgiving
to
Ma
.
It
rather
put
me
*NL*
out
at
first
this
morning
to
see
you
and
Miss
Clare
looking
so
neat
*NL*
and
pretty
and
to
feel
ashamed
of
Peepy
and
myself
too
,
but
on
the
*NL*
whole
I
hope
I
am
better-tempered
than
I
was
and
more
forgiving
to
*NL*
Ma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
girl
,
trying
so
hard
,
said
it
from
her
heart
,
and
touched
*NL*
mine
.
``
Caddy
,
my
love
,
''
I
replied
,
``
I
begin
to
have
a
great
affection
*NL*
for
you
,
and
I
hope
we
shall
become
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
?
''
cried
Caddy
.
``
How
happy
that
would
make
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Caddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
let
us
be
friends
from
this
time
,
and
let
*NL*
us
often
have
a
chat
about
these
matters
and
try
to
find
the
right
*NL*
way
through
them
.
''
Caddy
was
overjoyed
.
I
said
everything
I
could
in
*NL*
my
old-fashioned
way
to
comfort
and
encourage
her
,
and
I
would
not
*NL*
have
objected
to
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
that
day
for
any
smaller
*NL*
consideration
than
a
settlement
on
his
daughter-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
we
were
come
to
Mr.
Krook
's
,
whose
private
door
stood
*NL*
open
.
There
was
a
bill
,
pasted
on
the
door-post
,
announcing
a
room
to
*NL*
let
on
the
second
floor
.
It
reminded
Caddy
to
tell
me
as
we
proceeded
*NL*
upstairs
that
there
had
been
a
sudden
death
there
and
an
inquest
and
*NL*
that
our
little
friend
had
been
ill
of
the
fright
.
The
door
and
*NL*
window
of
the
vacant
room
being
open
,
we
looked
in
.
It
was
the
room
*NL*
with
the
dark
door
to
which
Miss
Flite
had
secretly
directed
my
*NL*
attention
when
I
was
last
in
the
house
.
A
sad
and
desolate
place
it
*NL*
was
,
a
gloomy
,
sorrowful
place
that
gave
me
a
strange
sensation
of
*NL*
mournfulness
and
even
dread
.
``
You
look
pale
,
''
said
Caddy
when
we
came
*NL*
out
,
``
and
cold
!
''
I
felt
as
if
the
room
had
chilled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
walked
slowly
while
we
were
talking
,
and
my
guardian
and
Ada
*NL*
were
here
before
us
.
We
found
them
in
Miss
Flite
's
garret
.
They
were
*NL*
looking
at
the
birds
,
while
a
medical
gentleman
who
was
so
good
as
to
*NL*
attend
Miss
Flite
with
much
solicitude
and
compassion
spoke
with
her
*NL*
cheerfully
by
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
finished
my
professional
visit
,
''
he
said
,
coming
forward
.
*NL*
``
Miss
Flite
is
much
better
and
may
appear
in
court
-LRB-
as
her
mind
is
*NL*
set
upon
it
-RRB-
to-morrow
.
She
has
been
greatly
missed
there
,
I
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Flite
received
the
compliment
with
complacency
and
dropped
a
*NL*
general
curtsy
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honoured
,
indeed
,
''
said
she
,
``
by
another
visit
from
the
wards
in

Ve-ry

with
a
special
curtsy
.
``
Fitz-Jarndyce
,
my

--
she
*NL*
had
bestowed
that
name
on
Caddy
,
it
appeared
,
and
always
called
her
*NL*
by
it
--
``
a
double
welcome

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
been
very
ill
?
''
asked
Mr.
Jarndyce
of
the
gentleman
whom
we
*NL*
had
found
in
attendance
on
her
.
She
answered
for
herself
directly
,
*NL*
though
he
had
put
the
question
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
decidedly
unwell

Oh
,
very
unwell
indeed

she
said
*NL*
confidentially
.
``
Not

trouble

much

in
a
subdued
voice
and
trembling
,
*NL*
``
we
have
had
death
here

There
was
poison
in

I
am
very

It
frightened
me

with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Flite

''
said
Mr.
Woodcourt
in
a
grave
kind
of
voice
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
appealing
to
her
while
speaking
to
us
,
and
laying
his
hand
*NL*
gently
on
her
arm
,
``
Miss
Flite
describes
her
illness
with
her
usual
*NL*
accuracy

She
was
alarmed
by
an
occurrence
in
the

which
might
*NL*
have
alarmed
a
stronger
person
,
and
was
made
ill
by
the
distress
and
*NL*
agitation
.
She
brought
me
here
in
the
first
hurry
of
the
discovery
,
*NL*
though
too
late
for
me
to
be
of
any
use
to
the
unfortunate
man
.
I
*NL*
have
compensated
myself
for
that
disappointment
by
coming
here
since

being
of
some
small
use
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
kindest
physician
in
the
college

whispered
Miss
Flite
to
me
.
*NL*
``
I
expect
a
judgment

On

shall
then

*NL*
``
She

said
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
looking
at
*NL*
her
with
an
observant
smile
,
``
as
she
ever

In

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Miss

smiling
brightly

You

I

said
Miss
Flite
,
drawing
herself
back
with
a
very
*NL*
shrewd
look
and
shaking
her
right
forefinger
in
a
most
significant
*NL*
manner
,
``
that
the
Lord
Chancellor

the
length

Until

Now
*NL*

very

To
confess
in

IS
a

slow
for

So
delicate

Attending
court
the
other

day
--
I
attend
it
regularly

with
my
documents

I
taxed
him
with
it

he
almost
confessed

That
is
,
I
smiled
at
him
from
my
bench

*NL*
HE
smiled
at
me
from
his
bench

But
it
's
great
good

it

And
Fitz-Jarndyce
lays
the
money
out

great

*NL*
Oh

I
assure
you
to
the
greatest
advantage

*NL*
*NL*
I
congratulated
her
-LRB-
as
she
addressed
herself
to
me
-RRB-
upon
this
*NL*
fortunate
addition
to
her
income
and
wished
her
a
long
continuance
of
*NL*
it
.
I
did
not
speculate
upon
the
source
from
which
it
came
or
wonder
*NL*
whose
humanity
was
so
considerate
.
My
guardian
stood
before
me
,
*NL*
contemplating
the
birds
,
and
I
had
no
need
to
look
beyond
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
call
these
little
fellows

said
he
in
his
*NL*
pleasant
voice
.
``
Have
they
any
names
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
answer
for
Miss
Flite
that
they

said
I
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Ada

very
well

*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
of
the
house
,
pushing
it
open
before
him
,
appeared
there
*NL*
with
his
fur
cap
in
his

his
cat
at
his
heels

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Mr.

looking
slowly

sharply
from
one
to

looked
at

all

*NL*

Miss

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

said
Mr.

-LRB-
which
he
never
did

``

Krook

The

had
*NL*
come
by
little
and
little
into
the
room
until
he
now
touched
my
*NL*
guardian
with
his
elbow
and
looked
close
up
into
his
face
with
his
*NL*
spectacled
eyes
.
``

strange
ways

This
was
in
a
whisper

aloud

winking
at

pointing
at

turned
away

affecting
to
sweep
the
grate

hurriedly

*NL*
The
old
man

looking
up
at

at

went

through

he
added

grinning

``

my

pretending

for

weathercock

*NL*
We
found
it
very
difficult
to
get
away
from
the
house
.
It
was
not
*NL*
Miss
Flite
who
detained
us
;
she
was
as
reasonable
a
little
creature
*NL*
in
consulting
the
convenience
of
others
as
there
possibly
could
be
.
*NL*
It
was
Mr.
Krook
.
He
seemed
unable
to
detach
himself
from
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
If
he
had
been
linked
to
him
,
he
could
hardly
have
attended
*NL*
him
more
closely
.
He
proposed
to
show
us
his
Court
of
Chancery
and
*NL*
all
the
strange
medley
it
contained
;
during
the
whole
of
our
*NL*
inspection
-LRB-
prolonged
by
himself
-RRB-
he
kept
close
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
and
*NL*
sometimes
detained
him
under
one
pretence
or
other
until
we
had
*NL*
passed
on
,
as
if
he
were
tormented
by
an
inclination
to
enter
upon
*NL*
some
secret
subject
which
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
approach
.
*NL*
I
can
not
imagine
a
countenance
and
manner
more
singularly
expressive
*NL*
of
caution
and
indecision
,
and
a
perpetual
impulse
to
do
something
he
*NL*
could
not
resolve
to
venture
on
,
than
Mr.
Krook
's
was
that
day
.
His
*NL*
watchfulness
of
my
guardian
was
incessant
.
He
rarely
removed
his
eyes
*NL*
from
his
face
.
If
he
went
on
beside
him
,
he
observed
him
with
the
*NL*
slyness
of
an
old
white
fox
.
If
he
went
before
,
he
looked
back
.
When
*NL*
we
stood
still
,
he
got
opposite
to
him
,
and
drawing
his
hand
across
*NL*
and
across
his
open
mouth
with
a
curious
expression
of
a
sense
of
*NL*
power
,
and
turning
up
his
eyes
,
and
lowering
his
grey
eyebrows
until
*NL*
they
appeared
to
be
shut
,
seemed
to
scan
every
lineament
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
having
been
-LRB-
always
attended
by
the
cat
-RRB-
all
over
the
house
*NL*
and
having
seen
the
whole
stock
of
miscellaneous
lumber
,
which
was
*NL*
certainly
curious
,
we
came
into
the
back
part
of
the
shop
.
Here
on
*NL*
the
head
of
an
empty
barrel
stood
on
end
were
an
ink-bottle
,
some
old
*NL*
stumps
of
pens
,
and
some
dirty
playbills
;
and
against
the
wall
were
*NL*
pasted
several
large
printed
alphabets
in
several
plain
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
?
''
asked
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trying
to
learn
myself
to
read
and
write
,
''
said
Krook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
get
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slow
.
Bad
,
''
returned
the
old
man
impatiently
.
``
It
's
hard
at
my
time
*NL*
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
easier
to
be
taught
by
some
one
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
but
they
might
teach
me
wrong
!
''
returned
the
old
man
with
a
*NL*
wonderfully
suspicious
flash
of
his
eye
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
may
*NL*
have
lost
by
not
being
learned
afore
.
I
would
n't
like
to
lose
*NL*
anything
by
being
learned
wrong
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wrong
?
''
said
my
guardian
with
his
good-humoured
smile
.
``
Who
do
you
*NL*
suppose
would
teach
you
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
of
Bleak
House
!
''
replied
the
old
man
,
*NL*
turning
up
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
and
rubbing
his
hands
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
as
anybody
would
,
but
I
'd
rather
trust
my
own
self
than
*NL*
another
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
answers
and
his
manner
were
strange
enough
to
cause
my
guardian
*NL*
to
inquire
of
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
as
we
all
walked
across
Lincoln
's
Inn
*NL*
together
,
whether
Mr.
Krook
were
really
,
as
his
lodger
represented
*NL*
him
,
deranged
.
The
young
surgeon
replied
,
no
,
he
had
seen
no
reason
*NL*
to
think
so
.
He
was
exceedingly
distrustful
,
as
ignorance
usually
*NL*
was
,
and
he
was
always
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
raw
gin
,
*NL*
of
which
he
drank
great
quantities
and
of
which
he
and
his
back-shop
,
*NL*
as
we
might
have
observed
,
smelt
strongly
;
but
he
did
not
think
him
*NL*
mad
as
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
way
home
,
I
so
conciliated
Peepy
's
affections
by
buying
him
a
*NL*
windmill
and
two
flour-sacks
that
he
would
suffer
nobody
else
to
take
*NL*
off
his
hat
and
gloves
and
would
sit
nowhere
at
dinner
but
at
my
*NL*
side
.
Caddy
sat
upon
the
other
side
of
me
,
next
to
Ada
,
to
whom
we
*NL*
imparted
the
whole
history
of
the
engagement
as
soon
as
we
got
back
.
*NL*
We
made
much
of
Caddy
,
and
Peepy
too
;
and
Caddy
brightened
*NL*
exceedingly
;
and
my
guardian
was
as
merry
as
we
were
;
and
we
were
all
*NL*
very
happy
indeed
until
Caddy
went
home
at
night
in
a
hackney-coach
,
*NL*
with
Peepy
fast
asleep
,
but
holding
tight
to
the
windmill
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
forgotten
to
mention
--
at
least
I
have
not
mentioned
--
that
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
was
the
same
dark
young
surgeon
whom
we
had
met
at
Mr.
*NL*
Badger
's
.
Or
that
Mr.
Jarndyce
invited
him
to
dinner
that
day
.
Or
*NL*
that
he
came
.
Or
that
when
they
were
all
gone
and
I
said
to
Ada
,
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
darling
,
let
us
have
a
little
talk
about
Richard
!
''
Ada
*NL*
laughed
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
think
it
matters
what
my
darling
said
.
She
was
always
*NL*
merry
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
Bell
Yard
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
in
London
Mr.
Jarndyce
was
constantly
beset
by
the
*NL*
crowd
of
excitable
ladies
and
gentlemen
whose
proceedings
had
so
much
*NL*
astonished
us
.
Mr.
Quale
,
who
presented
himself
soon
after
our
*NL*
arrival
,
was
in
all
such
excitements
.
He
seemed
to
project
those
two
*NL*
shining
knobs
of
temples
of
his
into
everything
that
went
on
and
to
*NL*
brush
his
hair
farther
and
farther
back
,
until
the
very
roots
were
*NL*
almost
ready
to
fly
out
of
his
head
in
inappeasable
philanthropy
.
All
*NL*
objects
were
alike
to
him
,
but
he
was
always
particularly
ready
for
*NL*
anything
in
the
way
of
a
testimonial
to
any
one
.
His
great
power
*NL*
seemed
to
be
his
power
of
indiscriminate
admiration
.
He
would
sit
for
*NL*
any
length
of
time
,
with
the
utmost
enjoyment
,
bathing
his
temples
in
*NL*
the
light
of
any
order
of
luminary
.
Having
first
seen
him
perfectly
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
admiration
of
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
I
had
supposed
her
to
be
*NL*
the
absorbing
object
of
his
devotion
.
I
soon
discovered
my
mistake
*NL*
and
found
him
to
be
train-bearer
and
organ-blower
to
a
whole
*NL*
procession
of
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pardiggle
came
one
day
for
a
subscription
to
something
,
and
with
*NL*
her
,
Mr.
Quale
.
Whatever
Mrs.
Pardiggle
said
,
Mr.
Quale
repeated
to
*NL*
us
;
and
just
as
he
had
drawn
Mrs.
Jellyby
out
,
he
drew
Mrs.
Pardiggle
*NL*
out
.
Mrs.
Pardiggle
wrote
a
letter
of
introduction
to
my
guardian
in
*NL*
behalf
of
her
eloquent
friend
Mr.
Gusher
.
With
Mr.
Gusher
appeared
*NL*
Mr.
Quale
again
.
Mr.
Gusher
,
being
a
flabby
gentleman
with
a
moist
*NL*
surface
and
eyes
so
much
too
small
for
his
moon
of
a
face
that
they
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
originally
made
for
somebody
else
,
was
not
at
*NL*
first
sight
prepossessing
;
yet
he
was
scarcely
seated
before
Mr.
*NL*
Quale
asked
Ada
and
me
,
not
inaudibly
,
whether
he
was
not
a
great
*NL*
creature
--
which
he
certainly
was
,
flabbily
speaking
,
though
Mr.
Quale
*NL*
meant
in
intellectual
beauty
--
and
whether
we
were
not
struck
by
his
*NL*
massive
configuration
of
brow
.
In
short
,
we
heard
of
a
great
many
*NL*
missions
of
various
sorts
among
this
set
of
people
,
but
nothing
*NL*
respecting
them
was
half
so
clear
to
us
as
that
it
was
Mr.
Quale
's
*NL*
mission
to
be
in
ecstasies
with
everybody
else
's
mission
and
that
it
*NL*
was
the
most
popular
mission
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
had
fallen
into
this
company
in
the
tenderness
of
his
*NL*
heart
and
his
earnest
desire
to
do
all
the
good
in
his
power
;
but
*NL*
that
he
felt
it
to
be
too
often
an
unsatisfactory
company
,
where
*NL*
benevolence
took
spasmodic
forms
,
where
charity
was
assumed
as
a
*NL*
regular
uniform
by
loud
professors
and
speculators
in
cheap
*NL*
notoriety
,
vehement
in
profession
,
restless
and
vain
in
action
,
*NL*
servile
in
the
last
degree
of
meanness
to
the
great
,
adulatory
of
one
*NL*
another
,
and
intolerable
to
those
who
were
anxious
quietly
to
help
*NL*
the
weak
from
failing
rather
than
with
a
great
deal
of
bluster
and
*NL*
self-laudation
to
raise
them
up
a
little
way
when
they
were
down
,
he
*NL*
plainly
told
us
.
When
a
testimonial
was
originated
to
Mr.
Quale
by
*NL*
Mr.
Gusher
-LRB-
who
had
already
got
one
,
originated
by
Mr.
Quale
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
when
Mr.
Gusher
spoke
for
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
subject
to
a
*NL*
meeting
,
including
two
charity
schools
of
small
boys
and
girls
,
who
*NL*
were
specially
reminded
of
the
widow
's
mite
,
and
requested
to
come
*NL*
forward
with
halfpence
and
be
acceptable
sacrifices
,
I
think
the
wind
*NL*
was
in
the
east
for
three
whole
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mention
this
because
I
am
coming
to
Mr.
Skimpole
again
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
me
that
his
off-hand
professions
of
childishness
and
carelessness
*NL*
were
a
great
relief
to
my
guardian
,
by
contrast
with
such
things
,
and
*NL*
were
the
more
readily
believed
in
since
to
find
one
perfectly
*NL*
undesigning
and
candid
man
among
many
opposites
could
not
fail
to
*NL*
give
him
pleasure
.
I
should
be
sorry
to
imply
that
Mr.
Skimpole
*NL*
divined
this
and
was
politic
;
I
really
never
understood
him
well
*NL*
enough
to
know
.
What
he
was
to
my
guardian
,
he
certainly
was
to
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
been
very
well
;
and
thus
,
though
he
lived
in
London
,
we
*NL*
had
seen
nothing
of
him
until
now
.
He
appeared
one
morning
in
his
*NL*
usual
agreeable
way
and
as
full
of
pleasant
spirits
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
said
,
here
he
was
!
He
had
been
bilious
,
but
rich
men
were
*NL*
often
bilious
,
and
therefore
he
had
been
persuading
himself
that
he
*NL*
was
a
man
of
property
.
So
he
was
,
in
a
certain
point
of
view
--
in
his
*NL*
expansive
intentions
.
He
had
been
enriching
his
medical
attendant
in
*NL*
the
most
lavish
manner
.
He
had
always
doubled
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
quadrupled
,
his
fees
.
He
had
said
to
the
doctor
,
``
Now
,
my
dear
*NL*
doctor
,
it
is
quite
a
delusion
on
your
part
to
suppose
that
you
*NL*
attend
me
for
nothing
.
I
am
overwhelming
you
with
money
--
in
my
*NL*
expansive
intentions
--
if
you
only
knew
it
!
''
And
really
-LRB-
he
said
-RRB-
he
*NL*
meant
it
to
that
degree
that
he
thought
it
much
the
same
as
doing
it
.
*NL*
If
he
had
had
those
bits
of
metal
or
thin
paper
to
which
mankind
*NL*
attached
so
much
importance
to
put
in
the
doctor
's
hand
,
he
would
*NL*
have
put
them
in
the
doctor
's
hand
.
Not
having
them
,
he
substituted
*NL*
the
will
for
the
deed
.
Very
well
!
If
he
really
meant
it
--
if
his
will
*NL*
were
genuine
and
real
,
which
it
was
--
it
appeared
to
him
that
it
was
*NL*
the
same
as
coin
,
and
cancelled
the
obligation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
,
partly
,
because
I
know
nothing
of
the
value
of
money
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
but
I
often
feel
this
.
It
seems
so
reasonable
!
My
*NL*
butcher
says
to
me
he
wants
that
little
bill
.
It
's
a
part
of
the
*NL*
pleasant
unconscious
poetry
of
the
man
's
nature
that
he
always
calls
*NL*
it
a
`
little
'
bill
--
to
make
the
payment
appear
easy
to
both
of
us
.
I
*NL*
reply
to
the
butcher
,
`
My
good
friend
,
if
you
knew
it
,
you
are
paid
.
*NL*
You
have
n't
had
the
trouble
of
coming
to
ask
for
the
little
bill
.
You
*NL*
are
paid
.
I
mean
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
suppose
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
laughing
,
``
he
had
meant
the
meat
in
*NL*
the
bill
,
instead
of
providing
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
''
he
returned
,
``
you
surprise
me
.
You
take
the
*NL*
butcher
's
position
.
A
butcher
I
once
dealt
with
occupied
that
very
*NL*
ground
.
Says
he
,
`
Sir
,
why
did
you
eat
spring
lamb
at
eighteen
pence
*NL*
a
pound

'
`
Why
did
I
eat
spring
lamb
at
eighteen
pence
a
pound
,
my
*NL*
honest
friend
?
'
said
I
,
naturally
amazed
by
the
question
.
'
I
like
*NL*
spring
lamb
!
'
This
was
so
far
convincing
.
`
Well
,
sir
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
*NL*
wish
I
had
meant
the
lamb
as
you
mean
the
money
!
'
`
My
good
fellow
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
pray
let
us
reason
like
intellectual
beings
.
How
could
that
*NL*
be
?
It
was
impossible
.
You
HAD
got
the
lamb
,
and
I
have
NOT
got
the
*NL*
money
.
You
could
n't
really
mean
the
lamb
without
sending
it
in
,
*NL*
whereas
I
can
,
and
do
,
really
mean
the
money
without
paying
it
!
'
He
*NL*
had
not
a
word
.
There
was
an
end
of
the
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
take
no
legal
proceedings
?
''
inquired
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
took
legal
proceedings
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
But
in
that
he
*NL*
was
influenced
by
passion
,
not
by
reason
.
Passion
reminds
me
of
*NL*
Boythorn
.
He
writes
me
that
you
and
the
ladies
have
promised
him
a
*NL*
short
visit
at
his
bachelor-house
in
Lincolnshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
great
favourite
with
my
girls
,

said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
and
I
*NL*
have
promised
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nature
forgot
to
shade
him
off
,
I
think
,
''
observed
Mr.
Skimpole
to
*NL*
Ada
and
me
.
``
A
little
too
boisterous
--
like
the
sea
.
A
little
too
*NL*
vehement
--
like
a
bull
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
consider
every
*NL*
colour
scarlet
.
But
I
grant
a
sledge-hammering
sort
of
merit
in
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
been
surprised
if
those
two
could
have
thought
very
*NL*
highly
of
one
another
,
Mr.
Boythorn
attaching
so
much
importance
to
*NL*
many
things
and
Mr.
Skimpole
caring
so
little
for
anything
.
Besides
*NL*
which
,
I
had
noticed
Mr.
Boythorn
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
*NL*
breaking
out
into
some
strong
opinion
when
Mr.
Skimpole
was
referred
*NL*
to
.
Of
course
I
merely
joined
Ada
in
saying
that
we
had
been
greatly
*NL*
pleased
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
invited
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
;
``
and
if
a
child
may
trust
*NL*
himself
in
such
hands
--
which
the
present
child
is
encouraged
to
do
,
*NL*
with
the
united
tenderness
of
two
angels
to
guard
him
--
I
shall
go
.
He
*NL*
proposes
to
frank
me
down
and
back
again
.
I
suppose
it
will
cost
*NL*
money
?
Shillings
perhaps
?
Or
pounds
?
Or
something
of
that
sort
?
By
*NL*
the
by
,
Coavinses
.
You
remember
our
friend
Coavinses
,
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
me
as
the
subject
arose
in
his
mind
,
in
his
graceful
,
*NL*
light-hearted
manner
and
without
the
least
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coavinses
has
been
arrested
by
the
Great
Bailiff
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
.
``
He
will
never
do
violence
to
the
sunshine
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
quite
shocked
me
to
hear
it
,
for
I
had
already
recalled
with
*NL*
anything
but
a
serious
association
the
image
of
the
man
sitting
on
*NL*
the
sofa
that
night
wiping
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
successor
informed
me
of
it
yesterday
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
His
*NL*
successor
is
in
my
house
now
--
in
possession
,
I
think
he
calls
it
.
He
*NL*
came
yesterday
,
on
my
blue-eyed
daughter
's
birthday
.
I
put
it
to
him
,
*NL*
`
This
is
unreasonable
and
inconvenient
.
If
you
had
a
blue-eyed
*NL*
daughter
you
would
n't
like
ME
to
come
,
uninvited
,
on
HER
birthday
?
'
*NL*
But
he
stayed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
laughed
at
the
pleasant
absurdity
and
lightly
touched
*NL*
the
piano
by
which
he
was
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
told
me
,
''
he
said
,
playing
little
chords
where
I
shall
put
*NL*
full
stops
,
``
The
Coavinses
had
left
.
Three
children
.
No
mother
.
And
*NL*
that
Coavinses
'
profession
.
Being
unpopular
.
The
rising
Coavinses
.
*NL*
Were
at
a
considerable
disadvantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
got
up
,
rubbing
his
head
,
and
began
to
walk
about
.
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
played
the
melody
of
one
of
Ada
's
favourite
songs
.
Ada
and
I
*NL*
both
looked
at
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
thinking
that
we
knew
what
was
passing
*NL*
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
and
stopping
,
and
several
times
leaving
off
rubbing
his
*NL*
head
,
and
beginning
again
,
my
guardian
put
his
hand
upon
the
keys
and
*NL*
stopped
Mr.
Skimpole
's
playing
.
``
I
do
n't
like
this
,
Skimpole
,
''
he
*NL*
said
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
,
who
had
quite
forgotten
the
subject
,
looked
up
*NL*
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
was
necessary
,
''
pursued
my
guardian
,
walking
backward
and
*NL*
forward
in
the
very
short
space
between
the
piano
and
the
end
of
the
*NL*
room
and
rubbing
his
hair
up
from
the
back
of
his
head
as
if
a
high
*NL*
east
wind
had
blown
it
into
that
form
.
``
If
we
make
such
men
necessary
*NL*
by
our
faults
and
follies
,
or
by
our
want
of
worldly
knowledge
,
or
by
*NL*
our
misfortunes
,
we
must
not
revenge
ourselves
upon
them
.
There
was
*NL*
no
harm
in
his
trade
.
He
maintained
his
children
.
One
would
like
to
*NL*
know
more
about
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Coavinses
?
''
cried
Mr.
Skimpole
,
at
length
perceiving
what
he
*NL*
meant
.
``
Nothing
easier
.
A
walk
to
Coavinses
'
headquarters
,
and
you
*NL*
can
know
what
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
nodded
to
us
,
who
were
only
waiting
for
the
signal
.
*NL*
``
Come
!
We
will
walk
that
way
,
my
dears
.
Why
not
that
way
as
soon
as
*NL*
another
!
''
We
were
quickly
ready
and
went
out
.
Mr.
Skimpole
went
with
*NL*
us
and
quite
enjoyed
the
expedition
.
It
was
so
new
and
so
refreshing
,
*NL*
he
said
,
for
him
to
want
Coavinses
instead
of
Coavinses
wanting
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
us
,
first
,
to
Cursitor
Street
,
Chancery
Lane
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
house
with
barred
windows
,
which
he
called
Coavinses
'
Castle
.
On
*NL*
our
going
into
the
entry
and
ringing
a
bell
,
a
very
hideous
boy
came
*NL*
out
of
a
sort
of
office
and
looked
at
us
over
a
spiked
wicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
did
you
want
?
''
said
the
boy
,
fitting
two
of
the
spikes
into
his
*NL*
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
follower
,
or
an
officer
,
or
something
,
here
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
``
who
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
said
the
boy
.
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
his
name
,
if
you
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
of
Neckett
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
his
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bell
Yard
,
''
said
the
boy
.
``
Chandler
's
shop
,
left
hand
side
,
name
of
*NL*
Blinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
--
I
do
n't
know
how
to
shape
the
question
--
''
murmured
my
*NL*
guardian
,
``
industrious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Neckett
?
''
said
the
boy
.
``
Yes
,
wery
much
so
.
He
was
never
tired
*NL*
of
watching
.
He
'd
set
upon
a
post
at
a
street
corner
eight
or
ten
*NL*
hours
at
a
stretch
if
he
undertook
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
have
done
worse
,
''
I
heard
my
guardian
soliloquize
.
``
He
*NL*
might
have
undertaken
to
do
it
and
not
done
it
.
Thank
you
.
That
's
all
*NL*
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
the
boy
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
arms
on
the
gate
,
*NL*
fondling
and
sucking
the
spikes
,
and
went
back
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
*NL*
where
Mr.
Skimpole
,
who
had
not
cared
to
remain
nearer
Coavinses
,
*NL*
awaited
us
.
Then
we
all
went
to
Bell
Yard
,
a
narrow
alley
at
a
very
*NL*
short
distance
.
We
soon
found
the
chandler
's
shop
.
In
it
was
a
*NL*
good-natured-looking
old
woman
with
a
dropsy
,
or
an
asthma
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neckett
's
children
?
''
said
she
in
reply
to
my
inquiry
.
``
Yes
,
Surely
,
*NL*
miss
.
Three
pair
,
if
you
please
.
Door
right
opposite
the
stairs
.
''
And
*NL*
she
handed
me
the
key
across
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
at
the
key
and
glanced
at
her
,
but
she
took
it
for
granted
*NL*
that
I
knew
what
to
do
with
it
.
As
it
could
only
be
intended
for
the
*NL*
children
's
door
,
I
came
out
without
asking
any
more
questions
and
led
*NL*
the
way
up
the
dark
stairs
.
We
went
as
quietly
as
we
could
,
but
four
*NL*
of
us
made
some
noise
on
the
aged
boards
,
and
when
we
came
to
the
*NL*
second
story
we
found
we
had
disturbed
a
man
who
was
standing
there
*NL*
looking
out
of
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Gridley
that
's
wanted
?
''
he
said
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
me
with
an
*NL*
angry
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
I
;
``
I
am
going
higher
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
Ada
,
and
at
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
and
at
Mr.
Skimpole
,
fixing
*NL*
the
same
angry
stare
on
each
in
succession
as
they
passed
and
*NL*
followed
me
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
gave
him
good
day
.
``
Good
day
!
''
he
said
*NL*
abruptly
and
fiercely
.
He
was
a
tall
,
sallow
man
with
a
careworn
head
*NL*
on
which
but
little
hair
remained
,
a
deeply
lined
face
,
and
prominent
*NL*
eyes
.
He
had
a
combative
look
and
a
chafing
,
irritable
manner
which
,
*NL*
associated
with
his
figure
--
still
large
and
powerful
,
though
*NL*
evidently
in
its
decline
--
rather
alarmed
me
.
He
had
a
pen
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
in
the
glimpse
I
caught
of
his
room
in
passing
,
I
saw
that
*NL*
it
was
covered
with
a
litter
of
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
him
standing
there
,
we
went
up
to
the
top
room
.
I
tapped
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
a
little
shrill
voice
inside
said
,
``
We
are
locked
in
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Blinder
's
got
the
key
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
applied
the
key
on
hearing
this
and
opened
the
door
.
In
a
poor
room
*NL*
with
a
sloping
ceiling
and
containing
very
little
furniture
was
a
*NL*
mite
of
a
boy
,
some
five
or
six
years
old
,
nursing
and
hushing
a
*NL*
heavy
child
of
eighteen
months
.
There
was
no
fire
,
though
the
weather
*NL*
was
cold
;
both
children
were
wrapped
in
some
poor
shawls
and
tippets
*NL*
as
a
substitute
.
Their
clothing
was
not
so
warm
,
however
,
but
that
*NL*
their
noses
looked
red
and
pinched
and
their
small
figures
shrunken
*NL*
as
the
boy
walked
up
and
down
nursing
and
hushing
the
child
with
its
*NL*
head
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
locked
you
up
here
alone
?
''
we
naturally
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
''
said
the
boy
,
standing
still
to
gaze
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Charley
your
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
She
's
my
sister
,
Charlotte
.
Father
called
her
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
more
of
you
besides
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
''
said
the
boy
,
``
and
Emma
,
''
patting
the
limp
bonnet
of
the
child
*NL*
he
was
nursing
.
``
And
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Charley
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
a-washing
,
''
said
the
boy
,
beginning
to
walk
up
and
down
again
*NL*
and
taking
the
nankeen
bonnet
much
too
near
the
bedstead
by
trying
to
*NL*
gaze
at
us
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
looking
at
one
another
and
at
these
two
children
when
there
*NL*
came
into
the
room
a
very
little
girl
,
childish
in
figure
but
shrewd
*NL*
and
older-looking
in
the
face
--
pretty-faced
too
--
wearing
a
womanly
*NL*
sort
of
bonnet
much
too
large
for
her
and
drying
her
bare
arms
on
a
*NL*
womanly
sort
of
apron
.
Her
fingers
were
white
and
wrinkled
with
*NL*
washing
,
and
the
soap-suds
were
yet
smoking
which
she
wiped
off
her
*NL*
arms
.
But
for
this
,
she
might
have
been
a
child
playing
at
washing
*NL*
and
imitating
a
poor
working-woman
with
a
quick
observation
of
the
*NL*
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
come
running
from
some
place
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
*NL*
made
all
the
haste
she
could
.
Consequently
,
though
she
was
very
*NL*
light
,
she
was
out
of
breath
and
could
not
speak
at
first
,
as
she
*NL*
stood
panting
,
and
wiping
her
arms
,
and
looking
quietly
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
here
's
Charley
!
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
he
was
nursing
stretched
forth
its
arms
and
cried
out
to
be
*NL*
taken
by
Charley
.
The
little
girl
took
it
,
in
a
womanly
sort
of
*NL*
manner
belonging
to
the
apron
and
the
bonnet
,
and
stood
looking
at
us
*NL*
over
the
burden
that
clung
to
her
most
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
whispered
my
guardian
as
we
put
a
chair
for
the
*NL*
little
creature
and
got
her
to
sit
down
with
her
load
,
the
boy
*NL*
keeping
close
to
her
,
holding
to
her
apron
,
``
that
this
child
works
*NL*
for
the
rest
?
Look
at
this
!
For
God
's
sake
,
look
at
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
thing
to
look
at
.
The
three
children
close
together
,
and
two
*NL*
of
them
relying
solely
on
the
third
,
and
the
third
so
young
and
yet
*NL*
with
an
air
of
age
and
steadiness
that
sat
so
strangely
on
the
*NL*
childish
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
Charley
!
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
thirteen
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
What
a
great
age
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
What
a
great
age
,
*NL*
Charley
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
describe
the
tenderness
with
which
he
spoke
to
her
,
half
*NL*
playfully
yet
all
the
more
compassionately
and
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
live
alone
here
with
these
babies
,
Charley
?
''
said
my
*NL*
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
child
,
looking
up
into
his
face
with
perfect
*NL*
confidence
,
``
since
father
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
live
,
Charley
?
Oh
!
Charley
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
*NL*
turning
his
face
away
for
a
moment
,
``
how
do
you
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
father
died

sir
,
I
've
gone
out

washing

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
you

said
my
guardian
.
``
You
're
not
tall
enough

reach

tub

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
pattens
I
am

she
said
quickly
.
``
I
've
got
a
high
pair

*NL*
belonged
to
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when

die
?
Poor
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
died
just
after
Emma
was
born

said
the
child
,
glancing
at
*NL*
the
face
upon
her
bosom
.
``
Then
father
said
I
was
to
be
as
good
a

mother
to

I
could

And
so
I
tried
.
And
so
I
worked
at
home
and
*NL*
did
cleaning
and
nursing
and
washing
for
a
long
time
before
I
began
*NL*
to
go
out
.
And
that
's
how
I
know
how
;
do
n't
you
see

sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
often
go
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
As

as
I
can
,
''
said
Charley
,
opening
her
eyes
and
smiling
,
*NL*
``
because
of
earning
sixpences
and
shillings
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
always
lock
the
babies
up
when
you
go
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
keep
'em
safe
,
sir
,
do
n't
you
see
?
''
said
Charley
.
``
Mrs.
Blinder
*NL*
comes
up
now
and
then
,
and
Mr.
Gridley
comes
up
sometimes
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
I
can
run
in
sometimes
,
and
they
can
play
you
know
,
and
Tom
*NL*
a
n't
afraid
of
being
locked
up
,
are
you
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No-o
!
''
said
Tom
stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
it
comes
on
dark
,
the
lamps
are
lighted
down
in
the
court
,
and
*NL*
they
show
up
here
quite
bright
--
almost
quite
bright
.
Do
n't
they
,
*NL*
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Charley
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
almost
quite
bright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
's
as
good
as
gold
,
''
said
the
little
creature
--
Oh
,
in
such
a
*NL*
motherly
,
womanly
way
!
``
And
when
Emma
's
tired
,
he
puts
her
to
bed
.
*NL*
And
when
he
's
tired
he
goes
to
bed
himself
.
And
when
I
come
home
and
*NL*
light
the
candle
and
has
a
bit
of
supper
,
he
sits
up
again
and
has
it
*NL*
with
me
.
Do
n't
you
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
Charley
!
''
said
Tom
.
``
That
I
do
!
''
And
either
in
this
glimpse
*NL*
of
the
great
pleasure
of
his
life
or
in
gratitude
and
love
for
*NL*
Charley
,
who
was
all
in
all
to
him
,
he
laid
his
face
among
the
scanty
*NL*
folds
of
her
frock
and
passed
from
laughing
into
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
since
our
entry
that
a
tear
had
been
shed
among
*NL*
these
children
.
The
little
orphan
girl
had
spoken
of
their
father
and
*NL*
their
mother
as
if
all
that
sorrow
were
subdued
by
the
necessity
of
*NL*
taking
courage
,
and
by
her
childish
importance
in
being
able
to
work
,
*NL*
and
by
her
bustling
busy
way
.
But
now
,
when
Tom
cried
,
although
she
*NL*
sat
quite
tranquil
,
looking
quietly
at
us
,
and
did
not
by
any
*NL*
movement
disturb
a
hair
of
the
head
of
either
of
her
little
charges
,
*NL*
I
saw
two
silent
tears
fall
down
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
at
the
window
with
Ada
,
pretending
to
look
at
the
housetops
,
*NL*
and
the
blackened
stack
of
chimneys
,
and
the
poor
plants
,
and
the
*NL*
birds
in
little
cages
belonging
to
the
neighbours
,
when
I
found
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Blinder
,
from
the
shop
below
,
had
come
in
-LRB-
perhaps
it
had
taken
*NL*
her
all
this
time
to
get
upstairs
-RRB-
and
was
talking
to
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
much
to
forgive
'em
the
rent
,
sir
,
''
she
said
;
``
who
could
*NL*
take
it
from
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
my
guardian
to
us
two
.
``
It
is
enough
that
the
time
*NL*
will
come
when
this
good
woman
will
find
that
it
WAS
much
,
and
that
*NL*
forasmuch
as
she
did
it
unto
the
least
of
these
--
This
child
,
''
he
*NL*
added
after
a
few
moments
,
``
could
she
possibly
continue
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
sir
,
I
think
she
might
,
''
said
Mrs.
Blinder
,
getting
her
*NL*
heavy
breath
by
painful
degrees
.
``
She
's
as
handy
as
it
's
possible
to
*NL*
be
.
Bless
you
,
sir
,
the
way
she
tended
them
two
children
after
the
*NL*
mother
died
was
the
talk
of
the
yard
!
And
it
was
a
wonder
to
see
her
*NL*
with
him
after
he
was
took
ill
,
it
really
was
!
`
Mrs.
Blinder
,
'
he
*NL*
said
to
me
the
very
last
he
spoke
--
he
was
lying
there
--
`
Mrs.
*NL*
Blinder
,
whatever
my
calling
may
have
been
,
I
see
a
angel
sitting
in
*NL*
this
room
last
night
along
with
my
child
,
and
I
trust
her
to
Our
*NL*
Father
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
no
other
calling
?
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Blinder
,
``
he
was
nothing
but
a
follerers
.
*NL*
When
he
first
came
to
lodge
here
,
I
did
n't
know
what
he
was
,
and
I
*NL*
confess
that
when
I
found
out
I
gave
him
notice
.
It
was
n't
liked
in
*NL*
the
yard
.
It
was
n't
approved
by
the
other
lodgers
.
It
is
NOT
a
*NL*
genteel
calling
,
''
said
Mrs.
Blinder
,
``
and
most
people
do
object
to
*NL*
it
.
Mr.
Gridley
objected
to
it
very
strong
,
and
he
is
a
good
lodger
,
*NL*
though
his
temper
has
been
hard
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
gave
him
notice
?
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
gave
him
notice
,
''
said
Mrs.
Blinder
.
``
But
really
when
the
time
*NL*
came
,
and
I
knew
no
other
ill
of
him
,
I
was
in
doubts
.
He
was
*NL*
punctual
and
diligent
;
he
did
what
he
had
to
do
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Blinder
,
unconsciously
fixing
Mr.
Skimpole
with
her
eye
,
``
and
it
's
*NL*
something
in
this
world
even
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
kept
him
after
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
said
that
if
he
could
arrange
with
Mr.
Gridley
,
I
could
*NL*
arrange
it
with
the
other
lodgers
and
should
not
so
much
mind
its
*NL*
being
liked
or
disliked
in
the
yard
.
Mr.
Gridley
gave
his
consent
*NL*
gruff
--
but
gave
it
.
He
was
always
gruff
with
him
,
but
he
has
been
*NL*
kind
to
the
children
since
.
A
person
is
never
known
till
a
person
is
*NL*
proved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
many
people
been
kind
to
the
children
?
''
asked
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
the
whole
,
not
so
bad
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Blinder
;
``
but
certainly
*NL*
not
so
many
as
would
have
been
if
their
father
's
calling
had
been
*NL*
different
.
Mr.
Coavins
gave
a
guinea
,
and
the
follerers
made
up
a
*NL*
little
purse
.
Some
neighbours
in
the
yard
that
had
always
joked
and
*NL*
tapped
their
shoulders
when
he
went
by
came
forward
with
a
little
*NL*
subscription
,
and
--
in
general
--
not
so
bad
.
Similarly
with
Charlotte
.
*NL*
Some
people
wo
n't
employ
her
because
she
was
a
follerer
's
child
;
some
*NL*
people
that
do
employ
her
cast
it
at
her
;
some
make
a
merit
of
having
*NL*
her
to
work
for
them
,
with
that
and
all
her
draw-backs
upon
her
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
pay
her
less
and
put
upon
her
more
.
But
she
's
patienter
than
*NL*
others
would
be
,
and
is
clever
too
,
and
always
willing
,
up
to
the
*NL*
full
mark
of
her
strength
and
over
.
So
I
should
say
,
in
general
,
not
*NL*
so
bad
,
sir
,
but
might
be
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Blinder
sat
down
to
give
herself
a
more
favourable
opportunity
*NL*
of
recovering
her
breath
,
exhausted
anew
by
so
much
talking
before
it
*NL*
was
fully
restored
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
was
turning
to
speak
to
us
when
his
*NL*
attention
was
attracted
by
the
abrupt
entrance
into
the
room
of
the
*NL*
Mr.
Gridley
who
had
been
mentioned
and
whom
we
had
seen
on
our
way
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
may
be
doing
here

he
*NL*
said
,
as
if
he
resented
our
presence
,
``

you
'll
excuse

Well

How

it
with

all
to-day

*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
over
the
group
in
a
caressing
way
and
clearly
was
regarded
as
*NL*
a
friend
by
the
children
,
though
his
face
retained
its
stern
*NL*
character
and
his
manner
to
us
was
as
rude
as
it
could
be
.
My
*NL*
guardian
noticed
it
and
respected
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
,
surely
,
would
come
here

he
said
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
so

may
be
so

returned
the
other
,
taking
Tom
upon
his
*NL*
knee
and
waving
him
off
impatiently
.
``
I
do
n't
want

argue

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
sufficient
reason

I
dare

Mr.

,
``
for

being
chafed

irritated

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
again

exclaimed
the

becoming
violently
angry

*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

said
Gridley
,
putting
down
the
child
and
going
up
to
him
as
if

he
meant
to
strike
him

the

pausing
in
his
wrath

``

I

with
*NL*
renewed
violence
,
``
I
have
been
dragged
for
five

twenty
years
over

burning
iron

lost

treading
upon
velvet

Go
*NL*
into
the
Court
of
Chancery
yonder

ask
what

of
the
standing

jokes

brighten
up

sometimes

beating

salutation

More

yours

that
if

took

in
any
other

be
driven
mad

It
is
only
by
resenting

keep

speaking
in

homely

rustic
way

with
great
vehemence

``
You
may

tell

answer

do
it

under

I
must
do

nothing

doing

it

sinking
into
the
smiling
state
of
the
poor
little
mad
woman
*NL*
that
haunts
the
court

If
I
was
once
to
sit
down
under

I
should
*NL*
become
imbecile

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
passion
and
heat
in
which
he
was
,
and
the
manner
in
which
his
*NL*
face
worked
,
and
the
violent
gestures
with
which
he
accompanied
what
*NL*
he
said
,
were
most
painful
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
he
said
,
``
consider
my
case
.
As
true
as
there
is
a
*NL*
heaven
above
us
,
this
is
my
case
.
I
am
one
of
two
brothers
.
My
father
*NL*
-LRB-
a
farmer
-RRB-
made
a
will
and
left
his
farm
and
stock
and
so
forth
to
my
*NL*
mother
for
her
life
.
After
my
mother
's
death
,
all
was
to
come
to
me
*NL*
except
a
legacy
of
three
hundred
pounds
that
I
was
then
to
pay
my
*NL*
brother
.
My
mother
died
.
My
brother
some
time
afterwards
claimed
his
*NL*
legacy
.
I
and
some
of
my
relations
said
that
he
had
had
a
part
of
it
*NL*
already
in
board
and
lodging
and
some
other
things
.
Now
mind
!
That
*NL*
was
the
question
,
and
nothing
else
.
No
one
disputed
the
will
;
no
one
*NL*
disputed
anything
but
whether
part
of
that
three
hundred
pounds
had
*NL*
been
already
paid
or
not
.
To
settle
that
question
,
my
brother
filing
*NL*
a
bill
,
I
was
obliged
to
go
into
this
accursed
Chancery
;
I
was
forced
*NL*
there
because
the
law
forced
me
and
would
let
me
go
nowhere
else
.
*NL*
Seventeen
people
were
made
defendants
to
that
simple
suit
!
It
first
*NL*
came
on
after
two
years
.
It
was
then
stopped
for
another
two
years
*NL*
while
the
master
-LRB-
may
his
head
rot
off
!
-RRB-
inquired
whether
I
was
my
*NL*
father
's
son
,
about
which
there
was
no
dispute
at
all
with
any
mortal
*NL*
creature
.
He
then
found
out
that
there
were
not
defendants
*NL*
enough
--
remember
,
there
were
only
seventeen
as
yet
!
--
but
that
we
must
*NL*
have
another
who
had
been
left
out
and
must
begin
all
over
again
.
The
*NL*
costs
at
that
time
--
before
the
thing
was
begun
!
--
were
three
times
the
*NL*
legacy
.
My
brother
would
have
given
up
the
legacy
,
and
joyful
,
to
*NL*
escape
more
costs
.
My
whole
estate
,
left
to
me
in
that
will
of
my
*NL*
father
's
,
has
gone
in
costs
.
The
suit
,
still
undecided
,
has
fallen
*NL*
into
rack
,
and
ruin
,
and
despair
,
with
everything
else
--
and
here
I
*NL*
stand
,
this
day
!
Now
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
in
your
suit
there
are
thousands
*NL*
and
thousands
involved
,
where
in
mine
there
are
hundreds
.
Is
mine
*NL*
less
hard
to
bear
or
is
it
harder
to
bear
,
when
my
whole
living
was
*NL*
in
it
and
has
been
thus
shamefully
sucked
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
said
that
he
condoled
with
him
with
all
his
heart
and
*NL*
that
he
set
up
no
monopoly
himself
in
being
unjustly
treated
by
this
*NL*
monstrous
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
again
!
''
said
Mr.
Gridley
with
no
diminution
of
his
rage
.
``
The
*NL*
system
!
I
am
told
on
all
hands
,
it
's
the
system
.
I
must
n't
look
to
*NL*
individuals
.
It
's
the
system
.
I
must
n't
go
into
court
and
say
,
`
My
*NL*
Lord
,
I
beg
to
know
this
from
you
--
is
this
right
or
wrong
?
Have
you
*NL*
the
face
to
tell
me
I
have
received
justice
and
therefore
am
*NL*
dismissed
?
'
My
Lord
knows
nothing
of
it
.
He
sits
there
to
administer
*NL*
the
system
.
I
must
n't
go
to
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
the
solicitor
in
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
and
say
to
him
when
he
makes
me
furious
by
*NL*
being
so
cool
and
satisfied
--
as
they
all
do
,
for
I
know
they
gain
by
*NL*
it
while
I
lose
,
do
n't
I
?
--
I
must
n't
say
to
him
,
'
I
will
have
*NL*
something
out
of
some
one
for
my
ruin
,
by
fair
means
or
foul
!
'
HE
is
*NL*
not
responsible
.
It
's
the
system
.
But
,
if
I
do
no
violence
to
any
of
*NL*
them
,
here
--
I
may
!
I
do
n't
know
what
may
happen
if
I
am
carried
*NL*
beyond
myself
at
last
!
I
will
accuse
the
individual
workers
of
that
*NL*
system
against
me
,
face
to
face
,
before
the
great
eternal
bar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
passion
was
fearful
.
I
could
not
have
believed
in
such
rage
*NL*
without
seeing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
done
!
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
and
wiping
his
face
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
I
have
done
!
I
am
violent
,
I
know
.
I
ought
to
know
it
.
I
*NL*
have
been
in
prison
for
contempt
of
court
.
I
have
been
in
prison
for
*NL*
threatening
the
solicitor
.
I
have
been
in
this
trouble
,
and
that
*NL*
trouble
,
and
shall
be
again
.
I
am
the
man
from
Shropshire
,
and
I
*NL*
sometimes
go
beyond
amusing
them
,
though
they
have
found
it
amusing
,
*NL*
too
,
to
see
me
committed
into
custody
and
brought
up
in
custody
and
*NL*
all
that
.
It
would
be
better
for
me
,
they
tell
me
,
if
I
restrained
*NL*
myself
.
I
tell
them
that
if
I
did
restrain
myself
I
should
become
*NL*
imbecile
.
I
was
a
good-enough-tempered
man
once
,
I
believe
.
People
in
*NL*
my
part
of
the
country
say
they
remember
me
so
,
but
now
I
must
have
*NL*
this
vent
under
my
sense
of
injury
or
nothing
could
hold
my
wits
*NL*
together
.
It
would
be
far
better
for
you
,
Mr.
Gridley
,
'
the
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
told
me
last
week
,
`
not
to
waste
your
time
here
,
and
to
*NL*
stay
,
usefully
employed
,
down
in
Shropshire
.
'
`
My
Lord
,
my
Lord
,
I
*NL*
know
it
would
,
'
said
I
to
him
,
`
and
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
*NL*
me
never
to
have
heard
the
name
of
your
high
office
,
but
unhappily
*NL*
for
me
,
I
ca
n't
undo
the
past
,
and
the
past
drives
me
here
!
'
*NL*
Besides
,
''
he
added
,
breaking
fiercely
out
,
``
I
'll
shame
them
.
To
the
*NL*
last
,
I
'll
show
myself
in
that
court
to
its
shame
.
If
I
knew
when
I
*NL*
was
going
to
die
,
and
could
be
carried
there
,
and
had
a
voice
to
*NL*
speak
with
,
I
would
die
there
,
saying
,
`
You
have
brought
me
here
and
*NL*
sent
me
from
here
many
and
many
a
time
.
Now
send
me
out
feet
*NL*
foremost
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
countenance
had
,
perhaps
for
years
,
become
so
set
in
its
*NL*
contentious
expression
that
it
did
not
soften
,
even
now
when
he
was
*NL*
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
take
these
babies
down
to
my
room
for
an
hour
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
going
to
them
again
,
``
and
let
them
play
about
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
say
*NL*
all
this
,
but
it
do
n't
much
signify
.
You
're
not
afraid
of
me
,
Tom
,
*NL*
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Tom
.
``
You
ai
n't
angry
with
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
my
child
.
You
're
going
back
,
Charley
?
Aye
?
Come
then
,
*NL*
little
one
!
''
He
took
the
youngest
child
on
his
arm
,
where
she
was
*NL*
willing
enough
to
be
carried
.
``
I
should
n't
wonder
if
we
found
a
*NL*
ginger-bread
soldier
downstairs
.
Let
's
go
and
look
for
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
his
former
rough
salutation
,
which
was
not
deficient
in
a
*NL*
certain
respect
,
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
and
bowing
slightly
to
us
,
went
*NL*
downstairs
to
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
that
,
Mr.
Skimpole
began
to
talk
,
for
the
first
time
since
our
*NL*
arrival
,
in
his
usual
gay
strain
.
He
said
,
Well
,
it
was
really
very
*NL*
pleasant
to
see
how
things
lazily
adapted
themselves
to
purposes
.
*NL*
Here
was
this
Mr.
Gridley
,
a
man
of
a
robust
will
and
surprising
*NL*
energy
--
intellectually
speaking
,
a
sort
of
inharmonious
*NL*
blacksmith
--
and
he
could
easily
imagine
that
there
Gridley
was
,
years
*NL*
ago
,
wandering
about
in
life
for
something
to
expend
his
superfluous
*NL*
combativeness
upon
--
a
sort
of
Young
Love
among
the
thorns
--
when
the
*NL*
Court
of
Chancery
came
in
his
way
and
accommodated
him
with
the
exact
*NL*
thing
he
wanted
.
There
they
were
,
matched
,
ever
afterwards
!
Otherwise
*NL*
he
might
have
been
a
great
general
,
blowing
up
all
sorts
of
towns
,
or
*NL*
he
might
have
been
a
great
politician
,
dealing
in
all
sorts
of
*NL*
parliamentary
rhetoric
;
but
as
it
was
,
he
and
the
Court
of
Chancery
*NL*
had
fallen
upon
each
other
in
the
pleasantest
way
,
and
nobody
was
*NL*
much
the
worse
,
and
Gridley
was
,
so
to
speak
,
from
that
hour
provided
*NL*
for
.
Then
look
at
Coavinses
!
How
delightfully
poor
Coavinses
-LRB-
father
*NL*
of
these
charming
children
-RRB-
illustrated
the
same
principle
!
He
,
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
,
himself
,
had
sometimes
repined
at
the
existence
of
*NL*
Coavinses
.
He
had
found
Coavinses
in
his
way
.
He
could
had
dispensed
*NL*
with
Coavinses
.
There
had
been
times
when
,
if
he
had
been
a
sultan
,
*NL*
and
his
grand
vizier
had
said
one
morning
,
``
What
does
the
Commander
*NL*
of
the
Faithful
require
at
the
hands
of
his
slave
?
''
he
might
have
*NL*
even
gone
so
far
as
to
reply
,
``
The
head
of
Coavinses
!
''
But
what
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
the
case
?
That
,
all
that
time
,
he
had
been
giving
*NL*
employment
to
a
most
deserving
man
,
that
he
had
been
a
benefactor
to
*NL*
Coavinses
,
that
he
had
actually
been
enabling
Coavinses
to
bring
up
*NL*
these
charming
children
in
this
agreeable
way
,
developing
these
*NL*
social
virtues
!
Insomuch
that
his
heart
had
just
now
swelled
and
the
*NL*
tears
had
come
into
his
eyes
when
he
had
looked
round
the
room
and
*NL*
thought
,
``
I
was
the
great
patron
of
Coavinses
,
and
his
little
*NL*
comforts
were
MY
work
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
captivating
in
his
light
way
of
touching
these
*NL*
fantastic
strings
,
and
he
was
such
a
mirthful
child
by
the
side
of
*NL*
the
graver
childhood
we
had
seen
,
that
he
made
my
guardian
smile
even
*NL*
as
he
turned
towards
us
from
a
little
private
talk
with
Mrs.
Blinder
.
*NL*
We
kissed
Charley
,
and
took
her
downstairs
with
us
,
and
stopped
*NL*
outside
the
house
to
see
her
run
away
to
her
work
.
I
do
n't
know
where
*NL*
she
was
going
,
but
we
saw
her
run
,
such
a
little
,
little
creature
in
*NL*
her
womanly
bonnet
and
apron
,
through
a
covered
way
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
court
and
melt
into
the
city
's
strife
and
sound
like
a
dewdrop
in
*NL*
an
ocean
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Tom-all-Alone
's
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
Dedlock
is
restless
,
very
restless
.
The
astonished
*NL*
fashionable
intelligence
hardly
knows
where
to
have
her
.
To-day
she
*NL*
is
at
Chesney
Wold
;
yesterday
she
was
at
her
house
in
town
;
to-morrow
*NL*
she
may
be
abroad
,
for
anything
the
fashionable
intelligence
can
with
*NL*
confidence
predict
.
Even
Sir
Leicester
's
gallantry
has
some
trouble
*NL*
to
keep
pace
with
her
.
It
would
have
more
but
that
his
other
faithful
*NL*
ally
,
for
better
and
for
worse
--
the
gout
--
darts
into
the
old
oak
*NL*
bed-chamber
at
Chesney
Wold
and
grips
him
by
both
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
receives
the
gout
as
a
troublesome
demon
,
but
still
a
*NL*
demon
of
the
patrician
order
.
All
the
Dedlocks
,
in
the
direct
male
*NL*
line
,
through
a
course
of
time
during
and
beyond
which
the
memory
of
*NL*
man
goeth
not
to
the
contrary
,
have
had
the
gout
.
It
can
be
proved
,
*NL*
sir
.
Other
men
's
fathers
may
have
died
of
the
rheumatism
or
may
have
*NL*
taken
base
contagion
from
the
tainted
blood
of
the
sick
vulgar
,
but
*NL*
the
Dedlock
family
have
communicated
something
exclusive
even
to
the
*NL*
levelling
process
of
dying
by
dying
of
their
own
family
gout
.
It
has
*NL*
come
down
through
the
illustrious
line
like
the
plate
,
or
the
*NL*
pictures
,
or
the
place
in
Lincolnshire
.
It
is
among
their
dignities
.
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
is
perhaps
not
wholly
without
an
impression
,
though
he
*NL*
has
never
resolved
it
into
words
,
that
the
angel
of
death
in
the
*NL*
discharge
of
his
necessary
duties
may
observe
to
the
shades
of
the
*NL*
aristocracy
,
``
My
lords
and
gentlemen
,
I
have
the
honour
to
present
to
*NL*
you
another
Dedlock
certified
to
have
arrived
per
the
family
gout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Sir
Leicester
yields
up
his
family
legs
to
the
family
disorder
*NL*
as
if
he
held
his
name
and
fortune
on
that
feudal
tenure
.
He
feels
*NL*
that
for
a
Dedlock
to
be
laid
upon
his
back
and
spasmodically
*NL*
twitched
and
stabbed
in
his
extremities
is
a
liberty
taken
somewhere
,
*NL*
but
he
thinks
,
``
We
have
all
yielded
to
this
;
it
belongs
to
us
;
it
has
*NL*
for
some
hundreds
of
years
been
understood
that
we
are
not
to
make
*NL*
the
vaults
in
the
park
interesting
on
more
ignoble
terms
;
and
I
*NL*
submit
myself
to
the
compromise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
goodly
show
he
makes
,
lying
in
a
flush
of
crimson
and
gold
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
great
drawing-room
before
his
favourite
picture
of
*NL*
my
Lady
,
with
broad
strips
of
sunlight
shining
in
,
down
the
long
*NL*
perspective
,
through
the
long
line
of
windows
,
and
alternating
with
*NL*
soft
reliefs
of
shadow
.
Outside
,
the
stately
oaks
,
rooted
for
ages
in
*NL*
the
green
ground
which
has
never
known
ploughshare
,
but
was
still
a
*NL*
chase
when
kings
rode
to
battle
with
sword
and
shield
and
rode
*NL*
a-hunting
with
bow
and
arrow
,
bear
witness
to
his
greatness
.
Inside
,
*NL*
his
forefathers
,
looking
on
him
from
the
walls
,
say
,
``
Each
of
us
was
*NL*
a
passing
reality
here
and
left
this
coloured
shadow
of
himself
and
*NL*
melted
into
remembrance
as
dreamy
as
the
distant
voices
of
the
rooks
*NL*
now
lulling
you
to
rest
,
''
and
hear
their
testimony
to
his
greatness
*NL*
too
.
And
he
is
very
great
this
day
.
And
woe
to
Boythorn
or
other
*NL*
daring
wight
who
shall
presumptuously
contest
an
inch
with
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
is
at
present
represented
,
near
Sir
Leicester
,
by
her
*NL*
portrait
.
She
has
flitted
away
to
town
,
with
no
intention
of
*NL*
remaining
there
,
and
will
soon
flit
hither
again
,
to
the
confusion
of
*NL*
the
fashionable
intelligence
.
The
house
in
town
is
not
prepared
for
*NL*
her
reception
.
It
is
muffled
and
dreary
.
Only
one
Mercury
in
powder
*NL*
gapes
disconsolate
at
the
hall-window
;
and
he
mentioned
last
night
to
*NL*
another
Mercury
of
his
acquaintance
,
also
accustomed
to
good
society
,
*NL*
that
if
that
sort
of
thing
was
to
last
--
which
it
could
n't
,
for
a
man
*NL*
of
his
spirits
could
n't
bear
it
,
and
a
man
of
his
figure
could
n't
be
*NL*
expected
to
bear
it
--
there
would
be
no
resource
for
him
,
upon
his
*NL*
honour
,
but
to
cut
his
throat
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
connexion
can
there
be
between
the
place
in
Lincolnshire
,
the
*NL*
house
in
town
,
the
Mercury
in
powder
,
and
the
whereabout
of
Jo
the
*NL*
outlaw
with
the
broom
,
who
had
that
distant
ray
of
light
upon
him
*NL*
when
he
swept
the
churchyard-step
?
What
connexion
can
there
have
been
*NL*
between
many
people
in
the
innumerable
histories
of
this
world
who
*NL*
from
opposite
sides
of
great
gulfs
have
,
nevertheless
,
been
very
*NL*
curiously
brought
together
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
sweeps
his
crossing
all
day
long
,
unconscious
of
the
link
,
if
any
*NL*
link
there
be
.
He
sums
up
his
mental
condition
when
asked
a
question
*NL*
by
replying
that
he
``
do
n't
know
nothink
.
''
He
knows
that
it
's
hard
to
*NL*
keep
the
mud
off
the
crossing
in
dirty
weather
,
and
harder
still
to
*NL*
live
by
doing
it
.
Nobody
taught
him
even
that
much
;
he
found
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
lives
--
that
is
to
say
,
Jo
has
not
yet
died
--
in
a
ruinous
place
*NL*
known
to
the
like
of
him
by
the
name
of
Tom-all-Alone
's
.
It
is
a
*NL*
black
,
dilapidated
street
,
avoided
by
all
decent
people
,
where
the
*NL*
crazy
houses
were
seized
upon
,
when
their
decay
was
far
advanced
,
by
*NL*
some
bold
vagrants
who
after
establishing
their
own
possession
took
*NL*
to
letting
them
out
in
lodgings
.
Now
,
these
tumbling
tenements
*NL*
contain
,
by
night
,
a
swarm
of
misery
.
As
on
the
ruined
human
wretch
*NL*
vermin
parasites
appear
,
so
these
ruined
shelters
have
bred
a
crowd
*NL*
of
foul
existence
that
crawls
in
and
out
of
gaps
in
walls
and
boards
;
*NL*
and
coils
itself
to
sleep
,
in
maggot
numbers
,
where
the
rain
drips
*NL*
in
;
and
comes
and
goes
,
fetching
and
carrying
fever
and
sowing
more
*NL*
evil
in
its
every
footprint
than
Lord
Coodle
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
,
*NL*
and
the
Duke
of
Foodle
,
and
all
the
fine
gentlemen
in
office
,
down
to
*NL*
Zoodle
,
shall
set
right
in
five
hundred
years
--
though
born
expressly
*NL*
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
lately
there
has
been
a
crash
and
a
cloud
of
dust
,
like
the
*NL*
springing
of
a
mine
,
in
Tom-all-Alone
's
;
and
each
time
a
house
has
*NL*
fallen
.
These
accidents
have
made
a
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
and
*NL*
have
filled
a
bed
or
two
in
the
nearest
hospital
.
The
gaps
remain
,
*NL*
and
there
are
not
unpopular
lodgings
among
the
rubbish
.
As
several
*NL*
more
houses
are
nearly
ready
to
go
,
the
next
crash
in
Tom-all-Alone
's
*NL*
may
be
expected
to
be
a
good
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
desirable
property
is
in
Chancery
,
of
course
.
It
would
be
an
*NL*
insult
to
the
discernment
of
any
man
with
half
an
eye
to
tell
him
so
.
*NL*
Whether
``
Tom
''
is
the
popular
representative
of
the
original
plaintiff
*NL*
or
defendant
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
,
or
whether
Tom
lived
here
when
*NL*
the
suit
had
laid
the
street
waste
,
all
alone
,
until
other
settlers
*NL*
came
to
join
him
,
or
whether
the
traditional
title
is
a
comprehensive
*NL*
name
for
a
retreat
cut
off
from
honest
company
and
put
out
of
the
*NL*
pale
of
hope
,
perhaps
nobody
knows
.
Certainly
Jo
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
I
do
n't
,
''
says
Jo
,
``
I
do
n't
know
nothink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
a
strange
state
to
be
like
Jo
!
To
shuffle
through
the
*NL*
streets
,
unfamiliar
with
the
shapes
,
and
in
utter
darkness
as
to
the
*NL*
meaning
,
of
those
mysterious
symbols
,
so
abundant
over
the
shops
,
and
*NL*
at
the
corners
of
streets
,
and
on
the
doors
,
and
in
the
windows
!
To
*NL*
see
people
read
,
and
to
see
people
write
,
and
to
see
the
postmen
*NL*
deliver
letters
,
and
not
to
have
the
least
idea
of
all
that
*NL*
language
--
to
be
,
to
every
scrap
of
it
,
stone
blind
and
dumb
!
It
must
*NL*
be
very
puzzling
to
see
the
good
company
going
to
the
churches
on
*NL*
Sundays
,
with
their
books
in
their
hands
,
and
to
think
-LRB-
for
perhaps
*NL*
Jo
DOES
think
at
odd
times
-RRB-
what
does
it
all
mean
,
and
if
it
means
*NL*
anything
to
anybody
,
how
comes
it
that
it
means
nothing
to
me
?
To
be
*NL*
hustled
,
and
jostled
,
and
moved
on
;
and
really
to
feel
that
it
would
*NL*
appear
to
be
perfectly
true
that
I
have
no
business
here
,
or
there
,
*NL*
or
anywhere
;
and
yet
to
be
perplexed
by
the
consideration
that
I
AM
*NL*
here
somehow
,
too
,
and
everybody
overlooked
me
until
I
became
the
*NL*
creature
that
I
am
!
It
must
be
a
strange
state
,
not
merely
to
be
told
*NL*
that
I
am
scarcely
human
-LRB-
as
in
the
case
of
my
offering
myself
for
a
*NL*
witness
-RRB-
,
but
to
feel
it
of
my
own
knowledge
all
my
life
!
To
see
the
*NL*
horses
,
dogs
,
and
cattle
go
by
me
and
to
know
that
in
ignorance
I
*NL*
belong
to
them
and
not
to
the
superior
beings
in
my
shape
,
whose
*NL*
delicacy
I
offend
!
Jo
's
ideas
of
a
criminal
trial
,
or
a
judge
,
or
a
*NL*
bishop
,
or
a
government
,
or
that
inestimable
jewel
to
him
-LRB-
if
he
only
*NL*
knew
it
-RRB-
the
Constitution
,
should
be
strange
!
His
whole
material
and
*NL*
immaterial
life
is
wonderfully
strange
;
his
death
,
the
strangest
*NL*
thing
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
comes
out
of
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
meeting
the
tardy
morning
which
is
*NL*
always
late
in
getting
down
there
,
and
munches
his
dirty
bit
of
bread
*NL*
as
he
comes
along
.
His
way
lying
through
many
streets
,
and
the
houses
*NL*
not
yet
being
open
,
he
sits
down
to
breakfast
on
the
door-step
of
the
*NL*
Society
for
the
Propagation
of
the
Gospel
in
Foreign
Parts
and
gives
*NL*
it
a
brush
when
he
has
finished
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
*NL*
accommodation
.
He
admires
the
size
of
the
edifice
and
wonders
what
*NL*
it
's
all
about
.
He
has
no
idea
,
poor
wretch
,
of
the
spiritual
*NL*
destitution
of
a
coral
reef
in
the
Pacific
or
what
it
costs
to
look
*NL*
up
the
precious
souls
among
the
coco-nuts
and
bread-fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
goes
to
his
crossing
and
begins
to
lay
it
out
for
the
day
.
The
*NL*
town
awakes
;
the
great
tee-totum
is
set
up
for
its
daily
spin
and
*NL*
whirl
;
all
that
unaccountable
reading
and
writing
,
which
has
been
*NL*
suspended
for
a
few
hours
,
recommences
.
Jo
and
the
other
lower
*NL*
animals
get
on
in
the
unintelligible
mess
as
they
can
.
It
is
*NL*
market-day
.
The
blinded
oxen
,
over-goaded
,
over-driven
,
never
guided
,
*NL*
run
into
wrong
places
and
are
beaten
out
,
and
plunge
red-eyed
and
*NL*
foaming
at
stone
walls
,
and
often
sorely
hurt
the
innocent
,
and
often
*NL*
sorely
hurt
themselves
.
Very
like
Jo
and
his
order
;
very
,
very
like
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
band
of
music
comes
and
plays
.
Jo
listens
to
it
.
So
does
a
dog
--
a
*NL*
drover
's
dog
,
waiting
for
his
master
outside
a
butcher
's
shop
,
and
*NL*
evidently
thinking
about
those
sheep
he
has
had
upon
his
mind
for
*NL*
some
hours
and
is
happily
rid
of
.
He
seems
perplexed
respecting
three
*NL*
or
four
,
ca
n't
remember
where
he
left
them
,
looks
up
and
down
the
*NL*
street
as
half
expecting
to
see
them
astray
,
suddenly
pricks
up
his
*NL*
ears
and
remembers
all
about
it
.
A
thoroughly
vagabond
dog
,
*NL*
accustomed
to
low
company
and
public-houses
;
a
terrific
dog
to
sheep
,
*NL*
ready
at
a
whistle
to
scamper
over
their
backs
and
tear
out
mouthfuls
*NL*
of
their
wool
;
but
an
educated
,
improved
,
developed
dog
who
has
been
*NL*
taught
his
duties
and
knows
how
to
discharge
them
.
He
and
Jo
listen
*NL*
to
the
music
,
probably
with
much
the
same
amount
of
animal
*NL*
satisfaction
;
likewise
as
to
awakened
association
,
aspiration
,
or
*NL*
regret
,
melancholy
or
joyful
reference
to
things
beyond
the
senses
,
*NL*
they
are
probably
upon
a
par
.
But
,
otherwise
,
how
far
above
the
human
*NL*
listener
is
the
brute
!
*NL*
*NL*
Turn
that
dog
's
descendants
wild
,
like
Jo
,
and
in
a
very
few
years
*NL*
they
will
so
degenerate
that
they
will
lose
even
their
bark
--
but
not
*NL*
their
bite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
changes
as
it
wears
itself
away
and
becomes
dark
and
drizzly
.
*NL*
Jo
fights
it
out
at
his
crossing
among
the
mud
and
wheels
,
the
*NL*
horses
,
whips
,
and
umbrellas
,
and
gets
but
a
scanty
sum
to
pay
for
*NL*
the
unsavoury
shelter
of
Tom-all-Alone
's
.
Twilight
comes
on
;
gas
*NL*
begins
to
start
up
in
the
shops
;
the
lamplighter
,
with
his
ladder
,
*NL*
runs
along
the
margin
of
the
pavement
.
A
wretched
evening
is
*NL*
beginning
to
close
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
chambers
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
sits
meditating
an
application
to
the
*NL*
nearest
magistrate
to-morrow
morning
for
a
warrant
.
Gridley
,
a
*NL*
disappointed
suitor
,
has
been
here
to-day
and
has
been
alarming
.
We
*NL*
are
not
to
be
put
in
bodily
fear
,
and
that
ill-conditioned
fellow
*NL*
shall
be
held
to
bail
again
.
From
the
ceiling
,
foreshortened
*NL*
Allegory
,
in
the
person
of
one
impossible
Roman
upside
down
,
points
*NL*
with
the
arm
of
Samson
-LRB-
out
of
joint
,
and
an
odd
one
-RRB-
obtrusively
*NL*
toward
the
window
.
Why
should
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
for
such
no
reason
,
*NL*
look
out
of
window
?
Is
the
hand
not
always
pointing
there
?
So
he
does
*NL*
not
look
out
of
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
he
did
,
what
would
it
be
to
see
a
woman
going
by
?
There
are
*NL*
women
enough
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
thinks
--
too
many
;
they
are
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
all
that
goes
wrong
in
it
,
though
,
for
the
matter
of
*NL*
that
,
they
create
business
for
lawyers
.
What
would
it
be
to
see
a
*NL*
woman
going
by
,
even
though
she
were
going
secretly
?
They
are
all
*NL*
secret
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
knows
that
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
are
not
all
like
the
woman
who
now
leaves
him
and
his
house
*NL*
behind
,
between
whose
plain
dress
and
her
refined
manner
there
is
*NL*
something
exceedingly
inconsistent
.
She
should
be
an
upper
servant
by
*NL*
her
attire
,
yet
in
her
air
and
step
,
though
both
are
hurried
and
*NL*
assumed
--
as
far
as
she
can
assume
in
the
muddy
streets
,
which
she
*NL*
treads
with
an
unaccustomed
foot
--
she
is
a
lady
.
Her
face
is
veiled
,
*NL*
and
still
she
sufficiently
betrays
herself
to
make
more
than
one
of
*NL*
those
who
pass
her
look
round
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
turns
her
head
.
Lady
or
servant
,
she
has
a
purpose
in
her
*NL*
and
can
follow
it
.
She
never
turns
her
head
until
she
comes
to
the
*NL*
crossing
where
Jo
plies
with
his
broom
.
He
crosses
with
her
and
begs
.
*NL*
Still
,
she
does
not
turn
her
head
until
she
has
landed
on
the
other
*NL*
side
.
Then
she
slightly
beckons
to
him
and
says
,
``
Come
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
follows
her
a
pace
or
two
into
a
quiet
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
boy
I
've
read
of
in
the
papers
?
''
she
asked
behind
her
*NL*
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
says
Jo
,
staring
moodily
at
the
veil
,
``
nothink
about
*NL*
no
papers
.
I
do
n't
know
nothink
about
nothink
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
examined
at
an
inquest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
nothink
about
no
--
where
I
was
took
by
the
beadle
,
do
*NL*
you
mean
?
''
says
Jo
.
``
Was
the
boy
's
name
at
the
inkwhich
Jo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
me
!
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
farther
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
about
the
man
?
''
says
Jo
,
following
.
``
Him
as
wos
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
Speak
in
a
whisper
!
Yes
.
Did
he
look
,
when
he
was
living
,
so
*NL*
very
ill
and
poor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
jist
!
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
look
like
--
not
like
YOU
?
''
says
the
woman
with
abhorrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
so
bad
as
me
,
''
says
Jo
.
``
I
'm
a
reg
`
lar
one
I
am
!
You
did
n't
*NL*
know
him
,
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
ask
me
if
I
knew
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
offence
,
my
lady
,
''
says
Jo
with
much
humility
,
for
even
he
has
*NL*
got
at
the
suspicion
of
her
being
a
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
a
lady
.
I
am
a
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
jolly
servant
!
''
says
Jo
without
the
least
idea
of
saying
*NL*
anything
offensive
,
merely
as
a
tribute
of
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
and
be
silent
.
Do
n't
talk
to
me
,
and
stand
farther
from
me
!
*NL*
Can
you
show
me
all
those
places
that
were
spoken
of
in
the
account
I
*NL*
read
?
The
place
he
wrote
for
,
the
place
he
died
at
,
the
place
where
*NL*
you
were
taken
to
,
and
the
place
where
he
was
buried
?
Do
you
know
the
*NL*
place
where
he
was
buried
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
answers
with
a
nod
,
having
also
nodded
as
each
other
place
was
*NL*
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
before
me
and
show
me
all
those
dreadful
places

Stop
opposite
to

each

Do

look
back

*NL*
Do
what
I
want

and
I
will
pay
you
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
attends
closely
while
the
words
are
being
spoken
;
tells
them
off
*NL*
on
his
broom-handle
,
finding
them
rather
hard
;
pauses
to
consider
*NL*
their
meaning
;
considers
it
satisfactory
;
and
nods
his
ragged
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
fly

''
says
Jo
.
``

exclaims

recoiling

Jo
screws
up
his
mouth
into
a
whistle
,
gives
his
ragged
head
a
rub
,
*NL*
takes
his
broom
under
his
arm
,
and
leads
the
way
,
passing
deftly
with
*NL*
his
bare
feet
over
the
hard
stones
and
through
the
mud
and
mire
.

Cook

stops

A
pause

*NL*
*NL*
``

Him

says
Jo
in
a

whisper
without
looking
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on

*NL*
Krook

Jo
stops
again

A

pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
HE
lived

Jo
answers
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
silence
he
is
asked
,
``
In

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
longer
walk
to
the
next
,
but
Jo
,
relieved
of
his
first
*NL*
suspicions
,
sticks
to
the
forms
imposed
upon
him
and
does
not
look
*NL*
round
.
By
many
devious
ways
,
reeking
with
offence
of
many
kinds
,
they
*NL*
come
to
the
little
tunnel
of
a
court
,
and
to
the
gas-lamp
-LRB-
lighted
*NL*
now
-RRB-
,
and
to
the
iron
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

says
Jo
,
holding
to
the

looking
in

*NL*
``
Where

Oh

*NL*
*NL*

Over

Jo

excited

Look

Ho

Into

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
shrinks
into
a
corner
,
into
a
corner
of
that
hideous
*NL*
archway
,
with
its
deadly
stains
contaminating
her
dress
;
and
putting
*NL*
out
her
two
hands
and
passionately
telling
him
to
keep
away
from
her
,
*NL*
for
he
is
loathsome
to
her
,
so
remains
for
some
moments
.
Jo
stands
*NL*
staring
and
is
still
staring
when
she
recovers
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
place
of

consecrated
ground

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

Jo

still

staring

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Jo
,
in
the

amazed
.

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Jo

staring
more
than
ever
;
``

repeats
Jo
,
something
troubled
in

his

*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
takes
as
little
heed
of
what
he
says
as
she
seems
to
take
*NL*
of
what
she
has
said
herself
.
She
draws
off
her
glove
to
get
some
*NL*
money
from
her
purse
.
Jo
silently
notices
how
white
and
small
her
*NL*
hand
is
and
what
a
jolly
servant
she
must
be
to
wear
such
sparkling
*NL*
rings
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drops
a
piece
of
money
in
his
hand
without
touching
it
,
and
*NL*
shuddering
as
their
hands
approach
.
``
Now

''
she
adds
,
``
show
me
the
*NL*
spot
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
thrusts
the
handle
of
his
broom
between
the
bars
of
the
gate
,
and
*NL*
with
his
utmost
power
of
elaboration
,
points
it
out
.
At
length
,
*NL*
looking
aside
to
see
if
he
has
made
himself
intelligible
,
he
finds
*NL*
that
he
is
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
proceeding
is
to
hold
the
piece
of
money
to
the
gas-light
*NL*
and
to
be
overpowered
at
finding
that
it
is
yellow
--
gold
.
His
next
is
*NL*
to
give
it
a
one-sided
bite
at
the
edge
as
a
test
of
its
quality
.
*NL*
His
next
,
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
for
safety
and
to
sweep
the
*NL*
step
and
passage
with
great
care
.
His
job
done
,
he
sets
off
for
*NL*
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
stopping
in
the
light
of
innumerable
gas-lamps
to
*NL*
produce
the
piece
of
gold
and
give
it
another
one-sided
bite
as
a
*NL*
reassurance
of
its
being
genuine

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
very
often
came
to
see
us
while
we
remained
in
London
-LRB-
though
*NL*
he
soon
failed
in
his
letter-writing
-RRB-
,
and
with
his
quick
abilities
,
*NL*
his
good
spirits
,
his
good
temper
,
his
gaiety
and
freshness
,
was
*NL*
always
delightful
.
But
though
I
liked
him
more
and
more
the
better
I
*NL*
knew
him
,
I
still
felt
more
and
more
how
much
it
was
to
be
regretted
*NL*
that
he
had
been
educated
in
no
habits
of
application
and
*NL*
concentration
.
The
system
which
had
addressed
him
in
exactly
the
same
*NL*
manner
as
it
had
addressed
hundreds
of
other
boys
,
all
varying
in
*NL*
character
and
capacity
,
had
enabled
him
to
dash
through
his
tasks
,
*NL*
always
with
fair
credit
and
often
with
distinction
,
but
in
a
fitful
,
*NL*
dazzling
way
that
had
confirmed
his
reliance
on
those
very
qualities
*NL*
in
himself
which
it
had
been
most
desirable
to
direct
and
train
.
They
*NL*
were
good
qualities
,
without
which
no
high
place
can
be
meritoriously
*NL*
won
,
but
like
fire
and
water
,
though
excellent
servants
,
they
were
*NL*
very
bad
masters
.
If
they
had
been
under
Richard
's
direction
,
they
*NL*
would
have
been
his
friends
;
but
Richard
being
under
their
direction
,
*NL*
they
became
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
write
down
these
opinions
not
because
I
believe
that
this
or
any
*NL*
other
thing
was
so
because
I
thought
so
,
but
only
because
I
did
think
*NL*
so
and
I
want
to
be
quite
candid
about
all
I
thought
and
did
.
These
*NL*
were
my
thoughts
about
Richard
.
I
thought
I
often
observed
besides
*NL*
how
right
my
guardian
was
in
what
he
had
said
,
and
that
the
*NL*
uncertainties
and
delays
of
the
Chancery
suit
had
imparted
to
his
*NL*
nature
something
of
the
careless
spirit
of
a
gamester
who
felt
that
*NL*
he
was
part
of
a
great
gaming
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
coming
one
afternoon
when
my
guardian
was
*NL*
not
at
home
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
I
naturally
inquired
after
*NL*
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
Carstone
,
''
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
is
very
well
and
is
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
a
great
acquisition
to
our
society
.
Captain
Swosser
used
to
say
*NL*
of
me
that
I
was
always
better
than
land
a-head
and
a
breeze
a-starn
*NL*
to
the
midshipmen
's
mess
when
the
purser
's
junk
had
become
as
tough
*NL*
as
the
fore-topsel
weather
earings
.
It
was
his
naval
way
of
*NL*
mentioning
generally
that
I
was
an
acquisition
to
any
society
.
I
may
*NL*
render
the
same
tribute
,
I
am
sure
,
to
Mr.
Carstone
.
But
I
--
you
wo
n't
*NL*
think
me
premature
if
I
mention
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
no
,
as
Mrs.
Badger
's
insinuating
tone
seemed
to
require
such
*NL*
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
Miss
Clare
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
sweetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
said
no
,
too
,
and
looked
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
my
dears
,
''
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
''
--
you
'll
excuse
me
*NL*
calling
you
my
dears
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
entreated
Mrs.
Badger
not
to
mention
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
really
are
,
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
of
saying
so
,
''
*NL*
pursued
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
so
perfectly
charming
.
You
see
,
my
dears
,
that
*NL*
although
I
am
still
young
--
or
Mr.
Bayham
Badger
pays
me
the
*NL*
compliment
of
saying
so
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Mr.
Badger
called
out
like
some
one
contradicting
at
a
public
*NL*
meeting
.
``
Not
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
smiled
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
we
will
say
still
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
said
Mr.
Badger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dears
,
though
still
young
,
I
have
had
many
opportunities
of
*NL*
observing
young
men
.
There
were
many
such
on
board
the
dear
old
*NL*
Crippler
,
I
assure
you
.
After
that
,
when
I
was
with
Captain
Swosser
*NL*
in
the
Mediterranean
,
I
embraced
every
opportunity
of
knowing
and
*NL*
befriending
the
midshipmen
under
Captain
Swosser
's
command
.
YOU
never
*NL*
heard
them
called
the
young
gentlemen
,
my
dears
,
and
probably
would
*NL*
not
understand
allusions
to
their
pipe-claying
their
weekly
accounts
,
*NL*
but
it
is
otherwise
with
me
,
for
blue
water
has
been
a
second
home
to
*NL*
me
,
and
I
have
been
quite
a
sailor
.
Again
,
with
Professor
Dingo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
of
European
reputation
,
''
murmured
Mr.
Badger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
lost
my
dear
first
and
became
the
wife
of
my
dear
second
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
speaking
of
her
former
husbands
as
if
they
were
*NL*
parts
of
a
charade
,
``
I
still
enjoyed
opportunities
of
observing
*NL*
youth
.
The
class
attendant
on
Professor
Dingo
's
lectures
was
a
large
*NL*
one
,
and
it
became
my
pride
,
as
the
wife
of
an
eminent
scientific
man
*NL*
seeking
herself
in
science
the
utmost
consolation
it
could
impart
,
to
*NL*
throw
our
house
open
to
the
students
as
a
kind
of
Scientific
*NL*
Exchange
.
Every
Tuesday
evening
there
was
lemonade
and
a
mixed
*NL*
biscuit
for
all
who
chose
to
partake
of
those
refreshments
.
And
there
*NL*
was
science
to
an
unlimited
extent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remarkable
assemblies
those
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mr.
Badger
*NL*
reverentially
.
``
There
must
have
been
great
intellectual
friction
*NL*
going
on
there
under
the
auspices
of
such
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
pursued
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
now
that
I
am
the
wife
of
my
dear
*NL*
third
,
Mr.
Badger
,
I
still
pursue
those
habits
of
observation
which
*NL*
were
formed
during
the
lifetime
of
Captain
Swosser
and
adapted
to
new
*NL*
and
unexpected
purposes
during
the
lifetime
of
Professor
Dingo
.
I
*NL*
therefore
have
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
Mr.
Carstone
as
a
*NL*
neophyte
.
And
yet
I
am
very
much
of
the
opinion
,
my
dears
,
that
he
*NL*
has
not
chosen
his
profession
advisedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
looked
so
very
anxious
now
that
I
asked
Mrs.
Badger
on
what
she
*NL*
founded
her
supposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
she
replied
,
``
on
Mr.
Carstone
's
character
*NL*
and
conduct
.
He
is
of
such
a
very
easy
disposition
that
probably
he
*NL*
would
never
think
it
worth-while
to
mention
how
he
really
feels
,
but
*NL*
he
feels
languid
about
the
profession
.
He
has
not
that
positive
*NL*
interest
in
it
which
makes
it
his
vocation
.
If
he
has
any
decided
*NL*
impression
in
reference
to
it
,
I
should
say
it
was
that
it
is
a
*NL*
tiresome
pursuit
.
Now
,
this
is
not
promising
.
Young
men
like
Mr.
*NL*
Allan
Woodcourt
who
take
it
from
a
strong
interest
in
all
that
it
can
*NL*
do
will
find
some
reward
in
it
through
a
great
deal
of
work
for
a
*NL*
very
little
money
and
through
years
of
considerable
endurance
and
*NL*
disappointment
.
But
I
am
quite
convinced
that
this
would
never
be
the
*NL*
case
with
Mr.
Carstone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Mr.
Badger
think
so
too
?
''
asked
Ada
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Mr.
Badger
,
``
to
tell
the
truth
,
Miss
Clare

this
view

the
matter
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
Mrs.
Badger
mentioned
it
.
But
*NL*
when
Mrs.
Badger
put
it
in
that
light
,
I
naturally
gave
great
*NL*
consideration
to
it
,
knowing
that
Mrs.
Badger
's
mind
,
in
addition
to
*NL*
its
natural
advantages
,
has
had
the
rare
advantage
of
being
formed
by
*NL*
two
such
very
distinguished
-LRB-
I
will
even
say
illustrious
-RRB-
public
men
*NL*
as
Captain
Swosser
of
the
Royal
Navy
and
Professor
Dingo
.
The
*NL*
conclusion
at
which
I
have
arrived
is
--
in
short
,
is
Mrs.
Badger
's
*NL*
conclusion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
maxim
of
Captain
Swosser
's
,
''
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
speaking
in
*NL*
his
figurative
naval
manner
,
that
when
you
make
pitch
hot
,
you
can
not
*NL*
make
it
too
hot
;
and
that
if
you
only
have
to
swab
a
plank
,
you
*NL*
should
swab
it
as
if
Davy
Jones
were
after
you
.
It
appears
to
me
that
*NL*
this
maxim
is
applicable
to
the
medical
as
well
as
to
the
nautical
*NL*
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
all
professions
,
''
observed
Mr.
Badger
.
``
It
was
admirably
said
by
*NL*
Captain
Swosser
.
Beautifully
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
objected
to
Professor
Dingo
when
we
were
staying
in
the
north
*NL*
of
Devon
after
our
marriage
,
''
said
Mrs.
Badger
,
``
that
he
disfigured
*NL*
some
of
the
houses
and
other
buildings
by
chipping
off
fragments
of
*NL*
those
edifices
with
his
little
geological
hammer
.
But
the
professor
*NL*
replied
that
he
knew
of
no
building
save
the
Temple
of
Science
.
The
*NL*
principle
is
the
same
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
the
same
,
''
said
Mr.
Badger
.
``
Finely
expressed
!
The
*NL*
professor
made
the
same
remark
,
Miss
Summerson
,
in
his
last
illness
,
*NL*
when
-LRB-
his
mind
wandering
-RRB-
he
insisted
on
keeping
his
little
hammer
*NL*
under
the
pillow
and
chipping
at
the
countenances
of
the
attendants
.
*NL*
The
ruling
passion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
we
could
have
dispensed
with
the
length
at
which
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Badger
pursued
the
conversation
,
we
both
felt
that
it
was
*NL*
disinterested
in
them
to
express
the
opinion
they
had
communicated
to
*NL*
us
and
that
there
was
a
great
probability
of
its
being
sound
.
We
*NL*
agreed
to
say
nothing
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
until
we
had
spoken
to
Richard
;
*NL*
and
as
he
was
coming
next
evening
,
we
resolved
to
have
a
very
serious
*NL*
talk
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
after
he
had
been
a
little
while
with
Ada
,
I
went
in
and
found
my
*NL*
darling
-LRB-
as
I
knew
she
would
be
-RRB-
prepared
to
consider
him
thoroughly
*NL*
right
in
whatever
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
get
on
,
Richard
?
''
said
I.
I
always
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
him
.
He
made
quite
a
sister
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Well
enough
!
''
said
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ca
n't
say
better
than
that
,
Esther
,
can
he
?
''
cried
my
pet
*NL*
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
look
at
my
pet
in
the
wisest
manner
,
but
of
course
I
*NL*
could
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
enough
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
well
enough
.
It
's
rather
jog-trotty
and
*NL*
humdrum
.
But
it
'll
do
as
well
as
anything
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
My
dear
Richard
!
''
I
remonstrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
well
as
anything
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
there
's
any
harm
in
that
,
Dame
Durden
,
''
said
Ada
,
*NL*
looking
so
confidingly
at
me
across
him
;
``
because
if
it
will
do
as
*NL*
well
as
anything
else
,
it
will
do
very
well
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
hope
so
,
''
returned
Richard
,
carelessly
tossing
his
hair
*NL*
from
his
forehead
.
``
After
all
,
it
may
be
only
a
kind
of
probation
*NL*
till
our
suit
is
--
I
forgot
though
.
I
am
not
to
mention
the
suit
.
*NL*
Forbidden
ground
!
Oh
,
yes
,
it
's
all
right
enough
.
Let
us
talk
about
*NL*
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
would
have
done
so
willingly
,
and
with
a
full
persuasion
that
we
*NL*
had
brought
the
question
to
a
most
satisfactory
state
.
But
I
thought
*NL*
it
would
be
useless
to
stop
there
,
so
I
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
Richard
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
my
dear
Ada
!
Consider
how
important
*NL*
it
is
to
you
both
,
and
what
a
point
of
honour
it
is
towards
your
*NL*
cousin
,
that
you
,
Richard
,
should
be
quite
in
earnest
without
any
*NL*
reservation
.
I
think
we
had
better
talk
about
this
,
really
,
Ada
.
It
*NL*
will
be
too
late
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
We
must
talk
about
it
!
''
said
Ada
.
``
But
I
think
Richard
is
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
use
of
my
trying
to
look
wise
when
she
was
so
pretty
,
*NL*
and
so
engaging
,
and
so
fond
of
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Badger
were
here
yesterday
,
Richard
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
they
*NL*
seemed
disposed
to
think
that
you
had
no
great
liking
for
the
*NL*
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
they
though
?
''
said
Richard
.
``
Oh
!
Well
,
that
rather
alters
the
*NL*
case
,
because
I
had
no
idea
that
they
thought
so
,
and
I
should
not
*NL*
have
liked
to
disappoint
or
inconvenience
them
.
The
fact
is
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
much
about
it
.
But
,
oh
,
it
do
n't
matter
!
It
'll
do
as
well
as
*NL*
anything
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
him
,
Ada
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
''
Richard
proceeded
,
half
thoughtfully
and
half
*NL*
jocosely
,
``
it
is
not
quite
in
my
way
.
I
do
n't
take
to
it
.
And
I
get
*NL*
too
much
of
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
's
first
and
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
THAT
'S
very
natural
!
''
cried
Ada
,
quite
delighted
.
``
The
*NL*
very
thing
we
both
said
yesterday
,
Esther
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
pursued
Richard
,
``
it
's
monotonous
,
and
to-day
is
too
like
*NL*
yesterday
,
and
to-morrow
is
too
like
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
afraid
,
''
said
I
,
``
this
is
an
objection
to
all
kinds
of
*NL*
application
--
to
life
itself
,
except
under
some
very
uncommon
*NL*
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
returned
Richard
,
still
considering
.
``
Perhaps
!
Ha
!
*NL*
Why
,
then
,
you
know
,
''
he
added
,
suddenly
becoming
gay
again
,
``
we
*NL*
travel
outside
a
circle
to
what
I
said
just
now
.
It
'll
do
as
well
as
*NL*
anything
else
.
Oh
,
it
's
all
right
enough
!
Let
us
talk
about
something
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
Ada
,
with
her
loving
face
--
and
if
it
had
seemed
innocent
and
*NL*
trusting
when
I
first
saw
it
in
that
memorable
November
fog
,
how
much
*NL*
more
did
it
seem
now
when
I
knew
her
innocent
and
trusting
*NL*
heart
--
even
Ada
shook
her
head
at
this
and
looked
serious
.
So
I
*NL*
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
hint
to
Richard
that
if
he
were
*NL*
sometimes
a
little
careless
of
himself
,
I
was
very
sure
he
never
*NL*
meant
to
be
careless
of
Ada
,
and
that
it
was
a
part
of
his
*NL*
affectionate
consideration
for
her
not
to
slight
the
importance
of
a
*NL*
step
that
might
influence
both
their
lives
.
This
made
him
almost
*NL*
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mother
Hubbard
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
's
the
very
thing
!
I
have
*NL*
thought
of
that
several
times
and
have
been
quite
angry
with
myself
*NL*
for
meaning
to
be
so
much
in
earnest
and
--
somehow
--
not
exactly
being
*NL*
so
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
;
I
seem
to
want
something
or
other
to
*NL*
stand
by
.
Even
you
have
no
idea
how
fond
I
am
of
Ada
-LRB-
my
darling
*NL*
cousin
,
I
love
you
,
so
much
!
-RRB-
,
but
I
do
n't
settle
down
to
constancy
*NL*
in
other
things
.
It
's
such
uphill
work
,
and
it
takes
such
a
time
!
''
*NL*
said
Richard
with
an
air
of
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
''
I
suggested
,
``
because
you
do
n't
like
what
you
have
*NL*
chosen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
''
said
Ada
.
``
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
It
was
not
of
the
least
use
my
trying
to
look
wise
.
I
tried
*NL*
again
,
but
how
could
I
do
it
,
or
how
could
it
have
any
effect
if
I
*NL*
could
,
while
Ada
rested
her
clasped
hands
upon
his
shoulder
and
while
*NL*
he
looked
at
her
tender
blue
eyes
,
and
while
they
looked
at
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
precious
girl
,
''
said
Richard
,
passing
her
golden
curls
*NL*
through
and
through
his
hand
,
``
I
was
a
little
hasty
perhaps
;
or
I
*NL*
misunderstood
my
own
inclinations
perhaps
.
They
do
n't
seem
to
lie
in
*NL*
that
direction
.
I
could
n't
tell
till
I
tried
.
Now
the
question
is
*NL*
whether
it
's
worth-while
to
undo
all
that
has
been
done
.
It
seems
*NL*
like
making
a
great
disturbance
about
nothing
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Richard
,
''
said
I
,
``
how
CAN
you
say
about
nothing
*NL*
particular
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
absolutely
that
,
''
he
returned
.
``
I
mean
that
it
MAY
be
*NL*
nothing
particular
because
I
may
never
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Ada
and
I
urged
,
in
reply
,
not
only
that
it
was
decidedly
*NL*
worth-while
to
undo
what
had
been
done
,
but
that
it
must
be
undone
.
I
*NL*
then
asked
Richard
whether
he
had
thought
of
any
more
congenial
*NL*
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Shipton
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
you
touch
me
home
.
Yes
,
*NL*
I
have
.
I
have
been
thinking
that
the
law
is
the
boy
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
law
!
''
repeated
Ada
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
went
into
Kenge
's
office
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
and
if
I
were
placed
*NL*
under
articles
to
Kenge
,
I
should
have
my
eye
on
the
--
hum
!
--
the
*NL*
forbidden
ground
--
and
should
be
able
to
study
it
,
and
master
it
,
and
*NL*
to
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
not
neglected
and
was
being
properly
*NL*
conducted
.
I
should
be
able
to
look
after
Ada
's
interests
and
my
own
*NL*
interests
-LRB-
the
same
thing
!
-RRB-
;
and
I
should
peg
away
at
Blackstone
and
*NL*
all
those
fellows
with
the
most
tremendous
ardour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
by
any
means
so
sure
of
that
,
and
I
saw
how
his
hankering
*NL*
after
the
vague
things
yet
to
come
of
those
long-deferred
hopes
cast
*NL*
a
shade
on
Ada
's
face
.
But
I
thought
it
best
to
encourage
him
in
any
*NL*
project
of
continuous
exertion
,
and
only
advised
him
to
be
quite
sure
*NL*
that
his
mind
was
made
up
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Minerva
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
I
am
as
steady
as
you
are
.
I
made
a
*NL*
mistake
;
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
;
I
wo
n't
do
so
any
more
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
become
such
a
lawyer
as
is
not
often
seen
.
That
is
,
you
know
,
''
*NL*
said
Richard
,
relapsing
into
doubt
,
``
if
it
really
is
worth-while
,
*NL*
after
all
,
to
make
such
a
disturbance
about
nothing
particular
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
led
to
our
saying
again
,
with
a
great
deal
of
gravity
,
all
that
*NL*
we
had
said
already
and
to
our
coming
to
much
the
same
conclusion
*NL*
afterwards
.
But
we
so
strongly
advised
Richard
to
be
frank
and
open
*NL*
with
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
and
his
disposition
was
*NL*
naturally
so
opposed
to
concealment
that
he
sought
him
out
at
once
*NL*
-LRB-
taking
us
with
him
-RRB-
and
made
a
full
avowal
.
``
Rick
,
''
said
my
*NL*
guardian
,
after
hearing
him
attentively
,
``
we
can
retreat
with
honour
,
*NL*
and
we
will
.
But
we
must
be
careful
--
for
our
cousin
's
sake
,
Rick
,
for
*NL*
our
cousin
's
sake
--
that
we
make
no
more
such
mistakes
.
Therefore
,
in
*NL*
the
matter
of
the
law
,
we
will
have
a
good
trial
before
we
decide
.
We
*NL*
will
look
before
we
leap
,
and
take
plenty
of
time
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
's
energy
was
of
such
an
impatient
and
fitful
kind
that
he
*NL*
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
gone
to
Mr.
Kenge
's
*NL*
office
in
that
hour
and
to
have
entered
into
articles
with
him
on
the
*NL*
spot
.
Submitting
,
however
,
with
a
good
grace
to
the
caution
that
we
*NL*
had
shown
to
be
so
necessary
,
he
contented
himself
with
sitting
down
*NL*
among
us
in
his
lightest
spirits
and
talking
as
if
his
one
unvarying
*NL*
purpose
in
life
from
childhood
had
been
that
one
which
now
held
*NL*
possession
of
him
.
My
guardian
was
very
kind
and
cordial
with
him
,
*NL*
but
rather
grave
,
enough
so
to
cause
Ada
,
when
he
had
departed
and
we
*NL*
were
going
upstairs
to
bed
,
to
say
,
``
Cousin
John
,
I
hope
you
do
n't
*NL*
think
the
worse
of
Richard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
love
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
was
very
natural
that
Richard
should
be
mistaken
in
such
*NL*
a
difficult
case
.
It
is
not
uncommon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
my
love
,
''
said
he
.
``
Do
n't
look
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
not
unhappy
,
cousin
John
!
''
said
Ada
,
smiling
cheerfully
,
*NL*
with
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
where
she
had
put
it
in
bidding
him
*NL*
good
night
.
``
But
I
should
be
a
little
so
if
you
thought
at
all
the
*NL*
worse
of
Richard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
I
should
think
the
worse
of
him
only
*NL*
if
you
were
ever
in
the
least
unhappy
through
his
means
.
I
should
be
*NL*
more
disposed
to
quarrel
with
myself
even
then
,
than
with
poor
Rick
,
*NL*
for
I
brought
you
together
.
But
,
tut
,
all
this
is
nothing
!
He
has
*NL*
time
before
him
,
and
the
race
to
run
.
I
think
the
worse
of
him
?
Not
*NL*
I
,
my
loving
cousin
!
And
not
you
,
I
swear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
cousin
John
,
''
said
Ada
,
``
I
am
sure
I
could
not
--
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
would
not
--
think
any
ill
of
Richard
if
the
whole
world
did
.
I
*NL*
could
,
and
I
would
,
think
better
of
him
then
than
at
any
other
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
quietly
and
honestly
she
said
it
,
with
her
hands
upon
his
*NL*
shoulders
--
both
hands
now
--
and
looking
up
into
his
face
,
like
the
*NL*
picture
of
truth
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
thoughtfully
regarding
her
,
``
I
think
it
*NL*
must
be
somewhere
written
that
the
virtues
of
the
mothers
shall
*NL*
occasionally
be
visited
on
the
children
,
as
well
as
the
sins
of
the
*NL*
father
.
Good
night
,
my
rosebud
.
Good
night
,
little
woman
.
Pleasant
*NL*
slumbers
!
Happy
dreams
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
him
follow
Ada
with
his
eyes
with
*NL*
something
of
a
shadow
on
their
benevolent
expression
.
I
well
*NL*
remembered
the
look
with
which
he
had
contemplated
her
and
Richard
*NL*
when
she
was
singing
in
the
firelight
;
it
was
but
a
very
little
while
*NL*
since
he
had
watched
them
passing
down
the
room
in
which
the
sun
was
*NL*
shining
,
and
away
into
the
shade
;
but
his
glance
was
changed
,
and
*NL*
even
the
silent
look
of
confidence
in
me
which
now
followed
it
once
*NL*
more
was
not
quite
so
hopeful
and
untroubled
as
it
had
originally
*NL*
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
praised
Richard
more
to
me
that
night
than
ever
she
had
praised
*NL*
him
yet
.
She
went
to
sleep
with
a
little
bracelet
he
had
given
her
*NL*
clasped
upon
her
arm
.
I
fancied
she
was
dreaming
of
him
when
I
kissed
*NL*
her
cheek
after
she
had
slept
an
hour
and
saw
how
tranquil
and
happy
*NL*
she
looked
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
was
so
little
inclined
to
sleep
myself
that
night
that
I
sat
up
*NL*
working
.
It
would
not
be
worth
mentioning
for
its
own
sake
,
but
I
was
*NL*
wakeful
and
rather
low-spirited
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
At
least
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
I
know
why
.
At
least
,
perhaps
I
do
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
*NL*
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
be
so
dreadfully
industrious
that
I
*NL*
would
leave
myself
not
a
moment
's
leisure
to
be
low-spirited
.
For
I
*NL*
naturally
said
,
``
Esther
!
You
to
be
low-spirited
.
YOU
!
''
And
it
really
*NL*
was
time
to
say
so
,
for
I
--
yes
,
I
really
did
see
myself
in
the
glass
,
*NL*
almost
crying
.
``
As
if
you
had
anything
to
make
you
unhappy
,
instead
*NL*
of
everything
to
make
you
happy
,
you
ungrateful
heart
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
could
have
made
myself
go
to
sleep
,
I
would
have
done
it
*NL*
directly
,
but
not
being
able
to
do
that
,
I
took
out
of
my
basket
some
*NL*
ornamental
work
for
our
house
-LRB-
I
mean
Bleak
House
-RRB-
that
I
was
busy
*NL*
with
at
that
time
and
sat
down
to
it
with
great
determination
.
It
was
*NL*
necessary
to
count
all
the
stitches
in
that
work
,
and
I
resolved
to
*NL*
go
on
with
it
until
I
could
n't
keep
my
eyes
open
,
and
then
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
found
myself
very
busy
.
But
I
had
left
some
silk
downstairs
in
*NL*
a
work-table
drawer
in
the
temporary
growlery
,
and
coming
to
a
stop
*NL*
for
want
of
it
,
I
took
my
candle
and
went
softly
down
to
get
it
.
To
*NL*
my
great
surprise
,
on
going
in
I
found
my
guardian
still
there
,
and
*NL*
sitting
looking
at
the
ashes
.
He
was
lost
in
thought
,
his
book
lay
*NL*
unheeded
by
his
side
,
his
silvered
iron-grey
hair
was
scattered
*NL*
confusedly
upon
his
forehead
as
though
his
hand
had
been
wandering
*NL*
among
it
while
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
and
his
face
looked
worn
.
*NL*
Almost
frightened
by
coming
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
,
I
stood
still
*NL*
for
a
moment
and
should
have
retired
without
speaking
had
he
not
,
in
*NL*
again
passing
his
hand
abstractedly
through
his
hair
,
seen
me
and
*NL*
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
what
I
had
come
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
work
so
late
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
working
late
to-night
,
''
said
I
,
``
because
I
could
n't
sleep
and
*NL*
wished
to
tire
myself
.
But
,
dear
guardian
,
you
are
late
too
,
and
look
*NL*
weary
.
You
have
no
trouble
,
I
hope
,
to
keep
you
waking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
little
woman
,
that
YOU
would
readily
understand
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
in
a
regretful
tone
so
new
to
me
that
I
inwardly
repeated
,
*NL*
as
if
that
would
help
me
to
his
meaning
,
``
That
I
could
readily
*NL*
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remain
a
moment
,
Esther
,
''
said
he
,
``
You
were
in
my
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
was
not
the
trouble
,
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slightly
waved
his
hand
and
fell
into
his
usual
manner
.
The
change
*NL*
was
so
remarkable
,
and
he
appeared
to
make
it
by
dint
of
so
much
*NL*
self-command
,
that
I
found
myself
again
inwardly
repeating
,
``
None
*NL*
that
I
could
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
woman
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
I
was
thinking
--
that
is
,
I
have
*NL*
been
thinking
since
I
have
been
sitting
here
--
that
you
ought
to
know
*NL*
of
your
own
history
all
I
know
.
It
is
very
little
.
Next
to
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
guardian
,
''
I
replied
,
``
when
you
spoke
to
me
before
on
that
*NL*
subject
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
since
then
,
''
he
gravely
interposed
,
anticipating
what
I
meant
to
*NL*
say
,
``
I
have
reflected
that
your
having
anything
to
ask
me
,
and
my
*NL*
having
anything
to
tell
you
,
are
different
considerations
,
Esther
.
It
*NL*
is
perhaps
my
duty
to
impart
to
you
the
little
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
so
,
guardian
,
it
is
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
he
returned
very
gently
,
and
kindly
,
and
very
*NL*
distinctly
.
``
My
dear
,
I
think
so
now
.
If
any
real
disadvantage
can
*NL*
attach
to
your
position
in
the
mind
of
any
man
or
woman
worth
a
*NL*
thought
,
it
is
right
that
you
at
least
of
all
the
world
should
not
*NL*
magnify
it
to
yourself
by
having
vague
impressions
of
its
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
and
said
after
a
little
effort
to
be
as
calm
as
I
ought
to
*NL*
be
,
``
One
of
my
earliest
remembrances
,
guardian
,
is
of
these
words
:
*NL*
`
Your
mother
,
Esther
,
is
your
disgrace
,
and
you
were
hers
.
The
time
*NL*
will
come
,
and
soon
enough
,
when
you
will
understand
this
better
,
and
*NL*
will
feel
it
too
,
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
.
'
''
I
had
covered
my
face
*NL*
with
my
hands
in
repeating
the
words
,
but
I
took
them
away
now
with
a
*NL*
better
kind
of
shame
,
I
hope
,
and
told
him
that
to
him
I
owed
the
*NL*
blessing
that
I
had
from
my
childhood
to
that
hour
never
,
never
,
*NL*
never
felt
it
.
He
put
up
his
hand
as
if
to
stop
me
.
I
well
knew
that
*NL*
he
was
never
to
be
thanked
,
and
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nine
years
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
after
thinking
for
a
little
while
,
*NL*
``
have
passed
since
I
received
a
letter
from
a
lady
living
in
*NL*
seclusion
,
written
with
a
stern
passion
and
power
that
rendered
it
*NL*
unlike
all
other
letters
I
have
ever
read
.
It
was
written
to
me
-LRB-
as
*NL*
it
told
me
in
so
many
words
-RRB-
,
perhaps
because
it
was
the
writer
's
*NL*
idiosyncrasy
to
put
that
trust
in
me
,
perhaps
because
it
was
mine
to
*NL*
justify
it
.
It
told
me
of
a
child
,
an
orphan
girl
then
twelve
years
*NL*
old
,
in
some
such
cruel
words
as
those
which
live
in
your
*NL*
remembrance
.
It
told
me
that
the
writer
had
bred
her
in
secrecy
from
*NL*
her
birth
,
had
blotted
out
all
trace
of
her
existence
,
and
that
if
*NL*
the
writer
were
to
die
before
the
child
became
a
woman
,
she
would
be
*NL*
left
entirely
friendless
,
nameless
,
and
unknown
.
It
asked
me
to
*NL*
consider
if
I
would
,
in
that
case
,
finish
what
the
writer
had
begun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
in
silence
and
looked
attentively
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
early
recollection
,
my
dear
,
will
supply
the
gloomy
medium
*NL*
through
which
all
this
was
seen
and
expressed
by
the
writer
,
and
the
*NL*
distorted
religion
which
clouded
her
mind
with
impressions
of
the
*NL*
need
there
was
for
the
child
to
expiate
an
offence
of
which
she
was
*NL*
quite
innocent
.
I
felt
concerned
for
the
little
creature
,
in
her
*NL*
darkened
life
,
and
replied
to
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
laid
the
injunction
on
me
that
I
should
never
propose
to
see
the
*NL*
writer
,
who
had
long
been
estranged
from
all
intercourse
with
the
*NL*
world
,
but
who
would
see
a
confidential
agent
if
I
would
appoint
one
.
*NL*
I
accredited
Mr.
Kenge
.
The
lady
said
,
of
her
own
accord
and
not
of
*NL*
his
seeking
,
that
her
name
was
an
assumed
one
.
That
she
was
,
if
there
*NL*
were
any
ties
of
blood
in
such
a
case

the
child
's
aunt

more

than
this
she
would

and
he
was
well
persuaded
of
the
*NL*
steadfastness
of
her
resolution
-RRB-
for
any
human
consideration
*NL*
disclose
.
My
dear
,
I
have
told
you
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
held
his
hand
for
a
little
while
in
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
my
ward
oftener
than
she
saw
me
,
''
he
added
,
cheerily
making
*NL*
light
of
it
,
``
and
I
always
knew
she
was
beloved
,
useful
,
and
happy
.
*NL*
She
repays
me
twenty-thousandfold
,
and
twenty
more
to
that
,
every
*NL*
hour
in
every
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
oftener
still
,
''
said
I
,
``
she
blesses
the
guardian
who
is
a
*NL*
father
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
word
father
,
I
saw
his
former
trouble
come
into
his
face
.
He
*NL*
subdued
it
as
before
,
and
it
was
gone
in
an
instant
;
but
it
had
been
*NL*
there
and
it
had
come
so
swiftly
upon
my
words
that
I
felt
as
if
they
*NL*
had
given
him
a
shock
.
I
again
inwardly
repeated
,
wondering
,
``
That
I
*NL*
could
readily
understand
.
None
that
I
could
readily
understand
!
''
No
,
*NL*
it
was
true
.
I
did
not
understand
it
.
Not
for
many
and
many
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
fatherly
good
night
,
my
dear
,
''
said
he
,
kissing
me
on
the
*NL*
forehead
,
``
and
so
to
rest
.
These
are
late
hours
for
working
and
*NL*
thinking
.
You
do
that
for
all
of
us
,
all
day
long
,
little
*NL*
housekeeper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
neither
worked
nor
thought
any
more
that
night
.
I
opened
my
*NL*
grateful
heart
to
heaven
in
thankfulness
for
its
providence
to
me
and
*NL*
its
care
of
me
,
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
visitor
next
day
.
Mr.
Allan
Woodcourt
came
.
He
came
to
take
*NL*
leave
of
us
;
he
had
settled
to
do
so
beforehand
.
He
was
going
to
*NL*
China
and
to
India
as
a
surgeon
on
board
ship
.
He
was
to
be
away
a
*NL*
long
,
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
--
at
least
I
know
--
that
he
was
not
rich
.
All
his
widowed
*NL*
mother
could
spare
had
been
spent
in
qualifying
him
for
his
*NL*
profession
.
It
was
not
lucrative
to
a
young
practitioner
,
with
very
*NL*
little
influence
in
London
;
and
although
he
was
,
night
and
day
,
at
*NL*
the
service
of
numbers
of
poor
people
and
did
wonders
of
gentleness
*NL*
and
skill
for
them
,
he
gained
very
little
by
it
in
money
.
He
was
*NL*
seven
years
older
than
I.
Not
that
I
need
mention
it
,
for
it
hardly
*NL*
seems
to
belong
to
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
--
I
mean
,
he
told
us
--
that
he
had
been
in
practice
three
or
*NL*
four
years
and
that
if
he
could
have
hoped
to
contend
through
three
*NL*
or
four
more
,
he
would
not
have
made
the
voyage
on
which
he
was
*NL*
bound
.
But
he
had
no
fortune
or
private
means
,
and
so
he
was
going
*NL*
away
.
He
had
been
to
see
us
several
times
altogether
.
We
thought
it
a
*NL*
pity
he
should
go
away
.
Because
he
was
distinguished
in
his
art
among
*NL*
those
who
knew
it
best
,
and
some
of
the
greatest
men
belonging
to
it
*NL*
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
to
bid
us
good-bye
,
he
brought
his
mother
with
him
for
*NL*
the
first
time
.
She
was
a
pretty
old
lady
,
with
bright
black
eyes
,
*NL*
but
she
seemed
proud
.
She
came
from
Wales
and
had
had
,
a
long
time
*NL*
ago
,
an
eminent
person
for
an
ancestor
,
of
the
name
of
Morgan
*NL*
ap-Kerrig
--
of
some
place
that
sounded
like
Gimlet
--
who
was
the
most
*NL*
illustrious
person
that
ever
was
known
and
all
of
whose
relations
*NL*
were
a
sort
of
royal
family
.
He
appeared
to
have
passed
his
life
*NL*
in
always
getting
up
into
mountains
and
fighting
somebody
;
and
*NL*
a
bard
whose
name
sounded
like
Crumlinwallinwer
had
sung
his
*NL*
praises
in
a
piece
which
was
called
,
as
nearly
as
I
could
catch
it
,
*NL*
Mewlinnwillinwodd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Woodcourt
,
after
expatiating
to
us
on
the
fame
of
her
great
*NL*
kinsman
,
said
that
no
doubt
wherever
her
son
Allan
went
he
would
*NL*
remember
his
pedigree
and
would
on
no
account
form
an
alliance
below
*NL*
it
.
She
told
him
that
there
were
many
handsome
English
ladies
in
*NL*
India
who
went
out
on
speculation
,
and
that
there
were
some
to
be
*NL*
picked
up
with
property
,
but
that
neither
charms
nor
wealth
would
*NL*
suffice
for
the
descendant
from
such
a
line
without
birth
,
which
must
*NL*
ever
be
the
first
consideration
.
She
talked
so
much
about
birth
that
*NL*
for
a
moment
I
half
fancied
,
and
with
pain
--
But
what
an
idle
fancy
to
*NL*
suppose
that
she
could
think
or
care
what
MINE
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
seemed
a
little
distressed
by
her
prolixity
,
but
he
was
*NL*
too
considerate
to
let
her
see
it
and
contrived
delicately
to
bring
*NL*
the
conversation
round
to
making
his
acknowledgments
to
my
guardian
*NL*
for
his
hospitality
and
for
the
very
happy
hours
--
he
called
them
the
*NL*
very
happy
hours
--
he
had
passed
with
us
.
The
recollection
of
them
,
he
*NL*
said
,
would
go
with
him
wherever
he
went
and
would
be
always
*NL*
treasured
.
And
so
we
gave
him
our
hands
,
one
after
another
--
at
least
,
*NL*
they
did
--
and
I
did
;
and
so
he
put
his
lips
to
Ada
's
hand
--
and
to
*NL*
mine
;
and
so
he
went
away
upon
his
long
,
long
voyage
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
busy
indeed
all
day
and
wrote
directions
home
to
the
*NL*
servants
,
and
wrote
notes
for
my
guardian
,
and
dusted
his
books
and
*NL*
papers
,
and
jingled
my
housekeeping
keys
a
good
deal
,
one
way
and
*NL*
another
.
I
was
still
busy
between
the
lights
,
singing
and
working
by
*NL*
the
window
,
when
who
should
come
in
but
Caddy
,
whom
I
had
no
*NL*
expectation
of
seeing
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Caddy
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I
,
``
what
beautiful
flowers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
such
an
exquisite
little
nosegay
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
think
so
,
Esther
,
''
replied
Caddy
.
``
They
are
the
loveliest
*NL*
I
ever
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
my
dear
?
''
said
I
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Caddy
,
shaking
her
head
and
holding
them
to
me
to
*NL*
smell
.
``
Not
Prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
Caddy
!
''
said
I.
``
You
must
have
two
lovers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Do
they
look
like
that
sort
of
thing
?
''
said
Caddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
look
like
that
sort
of
thing
?
''
I
repeated
,
pinching
her
*NL*
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
only
laughed
in
return
,
and
telling
me
that
she
had
come
for
*NL*
half
an
hour
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
Prince
would
be
waiting
*NL*
for
her
at
the
corner
,
sat
chatting
with
me
and
Ada
in
the
window
,
*NL*
every
now
and
then
handing
me
the
flowers
again
or
trying
how
they
*NL*
looked
against
my
hair
.
At
last
,
when
she
was
going
,
she
took
me
into
*NL*
my
room
and
put
them
in
my
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
?
''
said
I
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
,
''
said
Caddy
with
a
kiss
.
``
They
were
left
behind
by
*NL*
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Left
behind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
poor
Miss
Flite
's
,
''
said
Caddy
.
``
Somebody
who
has
been
very
good
*NL*
to
her
was
hurrying
away
an
hour
ago
to
join
a
ship
and
left
these
*NL*
flowers
behind
.
No
,
no
!
Do
n't
take
them
out
.
Let
the
pretty
little
*NL*
things
lie
here
,
''
said
Caddy
,
adjusting
them
with
a
careful
hand
,
*NL*
``
because
I
was
present
myself
,
and
I
should
n't
wonder
if
somebody
*NL*
left
them
on
purpose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
look
like
that
sort
of
thing
?
''
said
Ada
,
coming
laughingly
*NL*
behind
me
and
clasping
me
merrily
round
the
waist
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
indeed
*NL*
they
do
,
Dame
Durden
!
They
look
very
,
very
like
that
sort
of

*NL*
Oh
,
very
like
it
indeed

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
so
easy
as
it
had
appeared
at
first
to
arrange
for
*NL*
Richard
's
making
a
trial
of
Mr.
Kenge
's
office
.
Richard
himself
was
*NL*
the
chief
impediment
.
As
soon
as
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
leave
Mr.
*NL*
Badger
at
any
moment
,
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
wanted
to
leave
*NL*
him
at
all
.
He
did
n't
know
,
he
said
,
really
.
It
was
n't
a
bad
*NL*
profession
;
he
could
n't
assert
that
he
disliked
it
;
perhaps
he
liked
*NL*
it
as
well
as
he
liked
any
other
--
suppose
he
gave
it
one
more
chance
!
*NL*
Upon
that
,
he
shut
himself
up
for
a
few
weeks
with
some
books
and
*NL*
some
bones
and
seemed
to
acquire
a
considerable
fund
of
information
*NL*
with
great
rapidity
.
His
fervour
,
after
lasting
about
a
month
,
began
*NL*
to
cool
,
and
when
it
was
quite
cooled
,
began
to
grow
warm
again
.
His
*NL*
vacillations
between
law
and
medicine
lasted
so
long
that
midsummer
*NL*
arrived
before
he
finally
separated
from
Mr.
Badger
and
entered
on
an
*NL*
experimental
course
of
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
.
For
all
his
*NL*
waywardness
,
he
took
great
credit
to
himself
as
being
determined
to
*NL*
be
in
earnest
``
this
time
.
''
And
he
was
so
good-natured
throughout
,
and
*NL*
in
such
high
spirits
,
and
so
fond
of
Ada
,
that
it
was
very
difficult
*NL*
indeed
to
be
otherwise
than
pleased
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
who
,
I
may
mention
,
found
the
wind
much
given
,
*NL*
during
this
period
,
to
stick
in
the
east
;
``
As
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
*NL*
Richard
would
say
to
me
,
``
he
is
the
finest
fellow
in
the
world
,
*NL*
Esther
!
I
must
be
particularly
careful
,
if
it
were
only
for
his
*NL*
satisfaction
,
to
take
myself
well
to
task
and
have
a
regular
wind-up
*NL*
of
this
business
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
his
taking
himself
well
to
task
,
with
that
laughing
face
*NL*
and
heedless
manner
and
with
a
fancy
that
everything
could
catch
and
*NL*
nothing
could
hold
,
was
ludicrously
anomalous
.
However
,
he
told
us
*NL*
between-whiles
that
he
was
doing
it
to
such
an
extent
that
he
*NL*
wondered
his
hair
did
n't
turn
grey
.
His
regular
wind-up
of
the
*NL*
business
was
-LRB-
as
I
have
said
-RRB-
that
he
went
to
Mr.
Kenge
's
about
*NL*
midsummer
to
try
how
he
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
he
was
,
in
money
affairs
,
what
I
have
described
him
in
*NL*
a
former
illustration
--
generous
,
profuse
,
wildly
careless
,
but
fully
*NL*
persuaded
that
he
was
rather
calculating
and
prudent
.
I
happened
to
*NL*
say
to
Ada
,
in
his
presence
,
half
jestingly
,
half
seriously
,
about
*NL*
the
time
of
his
going
to
Mr.
Kenge
's
,
that
he
needed
to
have
*NL*
Fortunatus
'
purse
,
he
made
so
light
of
money
,
which
he
answered
in
*NL*
this
way
,
``
My
jewel
of
a
dear
cousin
,
you
hear
this
old
woman
!
Why
*NL*
does
she
say
that
?
Because
I
gave
eight
pounds
odd
-LRB-
or
whatever
it
*NL*
was
-RRB-
for
a
certain
neat
waistcoat
and
buttons
a
few
days
ago
.
Now
,
if
*NL*
I
had
stayed
at
Badger
's
I
should
have
been
obliged
to
spend
twelve
*NL*
pounds
at
a
blow
for
some
heart-breaking
lecture-fees
.
So
I
make
four
*NL*
pounds
--
in
a
lump
--
by
the
transaction
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
question
much
discussed
between
him
and
my
guardian
what
*NL*
arrangements
should
be
made
for
his
living
in
London
while
he
*NL*
experimented
on
the
law
,
for
we
had
long
since
gone
back
to
Bleak
*NL*
House
,
and
it
was
too
far
off
to
admit
of
his
coming
there
oftener
*NL*
than
once
a
week
.
My
guardian
told
me
that
if
Richard
were
to
settle
*NL*
down
at
Mr.
Kenge
's
he
would
take
some
apartments
or
chambers
where
*NL*
we
too
could
occasionally
stay
for
a
few
days
at
a
time
;
``
but
,
little
*NL*
woman
,
''
he
added
,
rubbing
his
head
very
significantly
,
``
he
has
n't
*NL*
settled
down
there
yet
!
''
The
discussions
ended
in
our
hiring
for
him
,
*NL*
by
the
month
,
a
neat
little
furnished
lodging
in
a
quiet
old
house
*NL*
near
Queen
Square
.
He
immediately
began
to
spend
all
the
money
he
had
*NL*
in
buying
the
oddest
little
ornaments
and
luxuries
for
this
lodging
;
*NL*
and
so
often
as
Ada
and
I
dissuaded
him
from
making
any
purchase
that
*NL*
he
had
in
contemplation
which
was
particularly
unnecessary
and
*NL*
expensive
,
he
took
credit
for
what
it
would
have
cost
and
made
out
*NL*
that
to
spend
anything
less
on
something
else
was
to
save
the
*NL*
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
affairs
were
in
abeyance
,
our
visit
to
Mr.
Boythorn
's
was
*NL*
postponed
.
At
length
,
Richard
having
taken
possession
of
his
lodging
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
our
departure
.
He
could
have
gone
with
*NL*
us
at
that
time
of
the
year
very
well
,
but
he
was
in
the
full
novelty
*NL*
of
his
new
position
and
was
making
most
energetic
attempts
to
unravel
*NL*
the
mysteries
of
the
fatal
suit
.
Consequently
we
went
without
him
,
*NL*
and
my
darling
was
delighted
to
praise
him
for
being
so
busy
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
a
pleasant
journey
down
into
Lincolnshire
by
the
coach
and
*NL*
had
an
entertaining
companion
in
Mr.
Skimpole
.
His
furniture
had
been
*NL*
all
cleared
off
,
it
appeared
,
by
the
person
who
took
possession
of
it
*NL*
on
his
blue-eyed
daughter
's
birthday
,
but
he
seemed
quite
relieved
to
*NL*
think
that
it
was
gone
.
Chairs
and
table
,
he
said
,
were
wearisome
*NL*
objects
;
they
were
monotonous
ideas
,
they
had
no
variety
of
*NL*
expression
,
they
looked
you
out
of
countenance
,
and
you
looked
them
*NL*
out
of
countenance
.
How
pleasant
,
then
,
to
be
bound
to
no
particular
*NL*
chairs
and
tables
,
but
to
sport
like
a
butterfly
among
all
the
*NL*
furniture
on
hire
,
and
to
flit
from
rosewood
to
mahogany
,
and
from
*NL*
mahogany
to
walnut
,
and
from
this
shape
to
that
,
as
the
humour
took
*NL*
one
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
oddity
of
the
thing
is
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
with
a
quickened
*NL*
sense
of
the
ludicrous
,
``
that
my
chairs
and
tables
were
not
paid
for
,
*NL*
and
yet
my
landlord
walks
off
with
them
as
composedly
as
possible
.
*NL*
Now
,
that
seems
droll
!
There
is
something
grotesque
in
it
.
The
chair
*NL*
and
table
merchant
never
engaged
to
pay
my
landlord
my
rent
.
Why
*NL*
should
my
landlord
quarrel
with
HIM
?
If
I
have
a
pimple
on
my
nose
*NL*
which
is
disagreeable
to
my
landlord
's
peculiar
ideas
of
beauty
,
my
*NL*
landlord
has
no
business
to
scratch
my
chair
and
table
merchant
's
*NL*
nose
,
which
has
no
pimple
on
it
.
His
reasoning
seems
defective
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
my
guardian
good-humouredly
,
``
it
's
pretty
clear
that
*NL*
whoever
became
security
for
those
chairs
and
tables
will
have
to
pay
*NL*
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
!
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
That
's
the
crowning
point
of
*NL*
unreason
in
the
business
!
I
said
to
my
landlord
,
`
My
good
man
,
you
*NL*
are
not
aware
that
my
excellent
friend
Jarndyce
will
have
to
pay
for
*NL*
those
things
that
you
are
sweeping
off
in
that
indelicate
manner
.
*NL*
Have
you
no
consideration
for
HIS
property
?
'
He
had
n't
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
refused
all
proposals
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Refused
all
proposals
,
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
I
made
him
business
*NL*
proposals
.
I
had
him
into
my
room
.
I
said
,
`
You
are
a
man
of
*NL*
business
,
I
believe
?
'
He
replied
,
'
I
am
,
'
`
Very
well
,
'
said
I
,
`
now
*NL*
let
us
be
business-like
.
Here
is
an
inkstand
,
here
are
pens
and
*NL*
paper
,
here
are
wafers
.
What
do
you
want
?
I
have
occupied
your
house
*NL*
for
a
considerable
period
,
I
believe
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
until
*NL*
this
unpleasant
misunderstanding
arose
;
let
us
be
at
once
friendly
*NL*
and
business-like
.
What
do
you
want
?
'
In
reply
to
this
,
he
made
use
*NL*
of
the
figurative
expression
--
which
has
something
Eastern
about
*NL*
it
--
that
he
had
never
seen
the
colour
of
my
money
.
`
My
amiable
*NL*
friend
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
never
have
any
money
.
I
never
know
anything
about
*NL*
money
.
'
`
Well
,
sir
,
'
said
he
,
`
what
do
you
offer
if
I
give
you
time
?
'
*NL*
`
My
good
fellow
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
have
no
idea
of
time
;
but
you
say
you
*NL*
are
a
man
of
business
,
and
whatever
you
can
suggest
to
be
done
in
a
*NL*
business-like
way
with
pen
,
and
ink
,
and
paper
--
and
wafers
--
I
am
*NL*
ready
to
do
.
Do
n't
pay
yourself
at
another
man
's
expense
-LRB-
which
is
*NL*
foolish
-RRB-
,
but
be
business-like
!
'
However
,
he
would
n't
be
,
and
there
*NL*
was
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
these
were
some
of
the
inconveniences
of
Mr.
Skimpole
's
childhood
,
*NL*
it
assuredly
possessed
its
advantages
too
.
On
the
journey
he
had
a
*NL*
very
good
appetite
for
such
refreshment
as
came
in
our
way
-LRB-
including
*NL*
a
basket
of
choice
hothouse
peaches
-RRB-
,
but
never
thought
of
paying
for
*NL*
anything
.
So
when
the
coachman
came
round
for
his
fee
,
he
pleasantly
*NL*
asked
him
what
he
considered
a
very
good
fee
indeed
,
now
--
a
liberal
*NL*
one
--
and
on
his
replying
half
a
crown
for
a
single
passenger
,
said
it
*NL*
was
little
enough
too
,
all
things
considered
,
and
left
Mr.
Jarndyce
*NL*
to
give
it
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
delightful
weather
.
The
green
corn
waved
so
beautifully
,
the
*NL*
larks
sang
so
joyfully
,
the
hedges
were
so
full
of
wild
flowers
,
the
*NL*
trees
were
so
thickly
out
in
leaf
,
the
bean-fields
,
with
a
light
wind
*NL*
blowing
over
them
,
filled
the
air
with
such
a
delicious
fragrance
!
*NL*
Late
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
the
market-town
where
we
were
to
*NL*
alight
from
the
coach
--
a
dull
little
town
with
a
church-spire
,
and
a
*NL*
marketplace
,
and
a
market-cross
,
and
one
intensely
sunny
street
,
and
*NL*
a
pond
with
an
old
horse
cooling
his
legs
in
it
,
and
a
very
few
men
*NL*
sleepily
lying
and
standing
about
in
narrow
little
bits
of
shade
.
*NL*
After
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
waving
of
the
corn
all
along
*NL*
the
road
,
it
looked
as
still
,
as
hot
,
as
motionless
a
little
town
as
*NL*
England
could
produce
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
inn
we
found
Mr.
Boythorn
on
horseback
,
waiting
with
an
open
*NL*
carriage
to
take
us
to
his
house
,
which
was
a
few
miles
off
.
He
was
*NL*
overjoyed
to
see
us
and
dismounted
with
great
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
heaven
!
''
said
he
after
giving
us
a
courteous
greeting
.
``
This
a
*NL*
most
infamous
coach
.
It
is
the
most
flagrant
example
of
an
abominable
*NL*
public
vehicle
that
ever
encumbered
the
face
of
the
earth
.
It
is
*NL*
twenty-five
minutes
after
its
time
this
afternoon
.
The
coachman
ought
*NL*
to
be
put
to
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
IS
he
after
his
time
?
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
to
whom
he
happened
to
*NL*
address
himself
.
``
You
know
my
infirmity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
minutes
!
Twenty-six
minutes
!
''
replied
Mr.
Boythorn
,
*NL*
referring
to
his
watch
.
``
With
two
ladies
in
the
coach
,
this
scoundrel
*NL*
has
deliberately
delayed
his
arrival
six
and
twenty
minutes
.
*NL*
Deliberately
!
It
is
impossible
that
it
can
be
accidental
!
But
his
*NL*
father
--
and
his
uncle
--
were
the
most
profligate
coachmen
that
ever
*NL*
sat
upon
a
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
said
this
in
tones
of
the
greatest
indignation
,
he
handed
us
*NL*
into
the
little
phaeton
with
the
utmost
gentleness
and
was
all
smiles
*NL*
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
ladies
,
''
he
said
,
standing
bare-headed
at
the
*NL*
carriage-door
when
all
was
ready
,
``
that
I
am
obliged
to
conduct
you
*NL*
nearly
two
miles
out
of
the
way
.
But
our
direct
road
lies
through
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
's
park
,
and
in
that
fellow
's
property
I
have
sworn
*NL*
never
to
set
foot
of
mine
,
or
horse
's
foot
of
mine
,
pending
the
*NL*
present
relations
between
us
,
while
I
breathe
the
breath
of
life
!
''
*NL*
And
here
,
catching
my
guardian
's
eye
,
he
broke
into
one
of
his
*NL*
tremendous
laughs
,
which
seemed
to
shake
even
the
motionless
little
*NL*
market-town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
Dedlocks
down
here
,
Lawrence
?
''
said
my
guardian
as
we
drove
*NL*
along
and
Mr.
Boythorn
trotted
on
the
green
turf
by
the
roadside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Arrogant
Numskull
is
here
,
''
replied
Mr.
Boythorn
.
``
Ha
ha
ha
!
Sir
*NL*
Arrogant
is
here
,
and
I
am
glad
to
say
,
has
been
laid
by
the
heels
*NL*
here
.
My
Lady
,
''
in
naming
whom
he
always
made
a
courtly
gesture
as
if
*NL*
particularly
to
exclude
her
from
any
part
in
the
quarrel
,
``
is
*NL*
expected
,
I
believe
,
daily
.
I
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
she
*NL*
postpones
her
appearance
as
long
as
possible
.
Whatever
can
have
*NL*
induced
that
transcendent
woman
to
marry
that
effigy
and
figure-head
*NL*
of
a
baronet
is
one
of
the
most
impenetrable
mysteries
that
ever
*NL*
baffled
human
inquiry
.
Ha
ha
ha
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
laughing
,
``
WE
may
set
foot
in
the
park
*NL*
while
we
are
here
?
The
prohibition
does
not
extend
to
us
,
does
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
lay
no
prohibition
on
my
guests
,
''
he
said
,
bending
his
head
to
*NL*
Ada
and
me
with
the
smiling
politeness
which
sat
so
gracefully
upon
*NL*
him
,
``
except
in
the
matter
of
their
departure
.
I
am
only
sorry
that
I
*NL*
can
not
have
the
happiness
of
being
their
escort
about
Chesney
Wold
,
*NL*
which
is
a
very
fine
place
!
But
by
the
light
of
this
summer
day
,
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
if
you
call
upon
the
owner
while
you
stay
with
me
,
you
are
*NL*
likely
to
have
but
a
cool
reception
.
He
carries
himself
like
an
*NL*
eight-day
clock
at
all
times
,
like
one
of
a
race
of
eight-day
clocks
*NL*
in
gorgeous
cases
that
never
go
and
never
went
--
Ha
ha
ha
!
--
but
he
*NL*
will
have
some
extra
stiffness
,
I
can
promise
you
,
for
the
friends
of
*NL*
his
friend
and
neighbour
Boythorn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
put
him
to
the
proof
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
He
is
as
*NL*
indifferent
to
the
honour
of
knowing
me
,
I
dare
say
,
as
I
am
to
the
*NL*
honour
of
knowing
him
.
The
air
of
the
grounds
and
perhaps
such
a
view
*NL*
of
the
house
as
any
other
sightseer
might
get
are
quite
enough
for
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Mr.
Boythorn
.
``
I
am
glad
of
it
on
the
whole

It
's
in
*NL*
better
keeping

I
am
looked
upon
about
here
as
a
second
Ajax
defying
*NL*
the
lightning

Ha
ha
ha

When
I
go
into
our
little
church
on
a
*NL*
Sunday
,
a
considerable
part
of
the
inconsiderable
congregation
expect
*NL*
to
see
me
drop
,
scorched
and
withered
,
on
the
pavement
under
the
*NL*
Dedlock
displeasure
.
Ha
ha
ha
ha
!
I
have
no
doubt
he
is
surprised
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
.
For
he
is
,
by
heaven
,
the
most
self-satisfied
,
and
the
*NL*
shallowest
,
and
the
most
coxcombical
and
utterly
brainless
ass

''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
coming
to
the
ridge
of
a
hill
we
had
been
ascending
enabled
our
*NL*
friend
to
point
out
Chesney
Wold
itself
to
us
and
diverted
his
*NL*
attention
from
its
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
picturesque
old
house
in
a
fine
park
richly
wooded
.
Among
*NL*
the
trees
and
not
far
from
the
residence
he
pointed
out
the
spire
of
*NL*
the
little
church
of
which
he
had
spoken
.
Oh
,
the
solemn
woods
over
*NL*
which
the
light
and
shadow
travelled
swiftly
,
as
if
heavenly
wings
*NL*
were
sweeping
on
benignant
errands
through
the
summer
air
;
the
smooth
*NL*
green
slopes
,
the
glittering
water
,
the
garden
where
the
flowers
were
*NL*
so
symmetrically
arranged
in
clusters
of
the
richest
colours
,
how
*NL*
beautiful
they
looked
!
The
house
,
with
gable
and
chimney
,
and
tower
,
*NL*
and
turret
,
and
dark
doorway
,
and
broad
terrace-walk
,
twining
among
*NL*
the
balustrades
of
which
,
and
lying
heaped
upon
the
vases
,
there
was
*NL*
one
great
flush
of
roses
,
seemed
scarcely
real
in
its
light
solidity
*NL*
and
in
the
serene
and
peaceful
hush
that
rested
on
all
around
it
.
To
*NL*
Ada
and
to
me
,
that
above
all
appeared
the
pervading
influence
.
On
*NL*
everything
,
house
,
garden
,
terrace
,
green
slopes
,
water
,
old
oaks
,
*NL*
fern
,
moss
,
woods
again
,
and
far
away
across
the
openings
in
the
*NL*
prospect
to
the
distance
lying
wide
before
us
with
a
purple
bloom
*NL*
upon
it
,
there
seemed
to
be
such
undisturbed
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
into
the
little
village
and
passed
a
small
inn
with
the
*NL*
sign
of
the
Dedlock
Arms
swinging
over
the
road
in
front
,
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
interchanged
greetings
with
a
young
gentleman
sitting
on
a
*NL*
bench
outside
the
inn-door
who
had
some
fishing-tackle
lying
beside
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
housekeeper
's
grandson
,
Mr.
Rouncewell

''
said
,
*NL*
he
,
``
and
he
is
in
love
with
a
pretty

up
at

Lady

Dedlock
has
taken
a
fancy
to

pretty

is
going

her

about
her

an
honour
which
my
young

himself
*NL*
does
not
at
all
appreciate

However
,
he
ca
n't
marry
just
yet
,
even
if
*NL*
his
Rosebud
were
willing
;
so
he
is
fain
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
In
*NL*
the
meanwhile
,
he
comes
here
pretty
often
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
*NL*
to

fish

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

asked
Ada

*NL*
*NL*

he
returned

``
I

may
perhaps

understand
each

you
will
see
them
soon
,
I
dare
say
,
and
I
*NL*
must
learn
from
you
on
such
a
point
--
not
you
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
blushed
,
and
Mr.
Boythorn
,
trotting
forward
on
his
comely
grey
*NL*
horse
,
dismounted
at
his
own
door
and
stood
ready
with
extended
arm
*NL*
and
uncovered
head
to
welcome
us
when
we
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
in
a
pretty
house
,
formerly
the
parsonage
house
,
with
a
lawn
*NL*
in
front
,
a
bright
flower-garden
at
the
side
,
and
a
well-stocked
*NL*
orchard
and
kitchen-garden
in
the
rear
,
enclosed
with
a
venerable
*NL*
wall
that
had
of
itself
a
ripened
ruddy
look
.
But
,
indeed
,
everything
*NL*
about
the
place
wore
an
aspect
of
maturity
and
abundance
.
The
old
*NL*
lime-tree
walk
was
like
green
cloisters
,
the
very
shadows
of
the
*NL*
cherry-trees
and
apple-trees
were
heavy
with
fruit
,
the
*NL*
gooseberry-bushes
were
so
laden
that
their
branches
arched
and
rested
*NL*
on
the
earth
,
the
strawberries
and
raspberries
grew
in
like
*NL*
profusion
,
and
the
peaches
basked
by
the
hundred
on
the
wall
.
Tumbled
*NL*
about
among
the
spread
nets
and
the
glass
frames
sparkling
and
*NL*
winking
in
the
sun
there
were
such
heaps
of
drooping
pods
,
and
*NL*
marrows
,
and
cucumbers
,
that
every
foot
of
ground
appeared
a
*NL*
vegetable
treasury
,
while
the
smell
of
sweet
herbs
and
all
kinds
of
*NL*
wholesome
growth
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
the
neighbouring
meadows
where
*NL*
the
hay
was
carrying
-RRB-
made
the
whole
air
a
great
nosegay
.
Such
*NL*
stillness
and
composure
reigned
within
the
orderly
precincts
of
the
*NL*
old
red
wall
that
even
the
feathers
hung
in
garlands
to
scare
the
*NL*
birds
hardly
stirred
;
and
the
wall
had
such
a
ripening
influence
that
*NL*
where
,
here
and
there
high
up
,
a
disused
nail
and
scrap
of
list
still
*NL*
clung
to
it
,
it
was
easy
to
fancy
that
they
had
mellowed
with
the
*NL*
changing
seasons
and
that
they
had
rusted
and
decayed
according
to
*NL*
the
common
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
,
though
a
little
disorderly
in
comparison
with
the
garden
,
*NL*
was
a
real
old
house
with
settles
in
the
chimney
of
the
brick-floored
*NL*
kitchen
and
great
beams
across
the
ceilings
.
On
one
side
of
it
was
*NL*
the
terrible
piece
of
ground
in
dispute
,
where
Mr.
Boythorn
*NL*
maintained
a
sentry
in
a
smock-frock
day
and
night
,
whose
duty
was
*NL*
supposed
to
be
,
in
cases
of
aggression
,
immediately
to
ring
a
large
*NL*
bell
hung
up
there
for
the
purpose
,
to
unchain
a
great
bull-dog
*NL*
established
in
a
kennel
as
his
ally
,
and
generally
to
deal
*NL*
destruction
on
the
enemy
.
Not
content
with
these
precautions
,
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
had
himself
composed
and
posted
there
,
on
painted
boards
to
*NL*
which
his
name
was
attached
in
large
letters
,
the
following
solemn
*NL*
warnings
:
``
Beware
of
the
bull-dog
.
He
is
most
ferocious

Lawrence

``

``
Take
notice

These
he
showed
us
*NL*
from
the
drawing-room
window
,
while
his
bird
was
hopping
about
his
*NL*
head
,
and
he
laughed
,
``
Ha
ha
ha
ha
!
Ha
ha
ha
ha
!
''
to
that
extent
as
*NL*
he
pointed
them
out
that
I
really
thought
he
would
have
hurt
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
taking
a
good

of
trouble

said
Mr.
Skimpole
in
his
*NL*
light
way
,
``

you
are
not
in

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

returned
Mr.
Boythorn
with
unspeakable
warmth
.
``
Not
*NL*
in
earnest

If
I
could
have
hoped
to
train
him
,
I
would
have
bought
a

lion
instead
of
that
dog

would
have
turned
him
loose
upon
the
*NL*
first
intolerable
robber
who
should
dare
to
make
an
encroachment
on
*NL*
my
rights

Let
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
consent
to
come
out
and
decide
*NL*
this
question
by
single
combat
,

I
will
meet
him
with
any
weapon
*NL*
known
to
mankind

much
in

*NL*
Not

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
arrived
at
his
house
on
a
Saturday
.
On
the
Sunday
morning
we
all
*NL*
set
forth
to
walk
to
the
little
church
in
the
park
.
Entering
the
*NL*
park
,
almost
immediately
by
the
disputed
ground
,
we
pursued
a
*NL*
pleasant
footpath
winding
among
the
verdant
turf
and
the
beautiful
*NL*
trees
until
it
brought
us
to
the
church-porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
congregation
was
extremely
small
and
quite
a
rustic
one
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
a
large
muster
of
servants
from
the
house
,
some
of
whom
*NL*
were
already
in
their
seats
,
while
others
were
yet
dropping
in
.
There
*NL*
were
some
stately
footmen
,
and
there
was
a
perfect
picture
of
an
old
*NL*
coachman
,
who
looked
as
if
he
were
the
official
representative
of
all
*NL*
the
pomps
and
vanities
that
had
ever
been
put
into
his
coach
.
There
*NL*
was
a
very
pretty
show
of
young
women
,
and
above
them
,
the
handsome
*NL*
old
face
and
fine
responsible
portly
figure
of
the
housekeeper
*NL*
towered
pre-eminent
.
The
pretty
girl
of
whom
Mr.
Boythorn
had
told
us
*NL*
was
close
by
her
.
She
was
so
very
pretty
that
I
might
have
known
her
*NL*
by
her
beauty
even
if
I
had
not
seen
how
blushingly
conscious
she
was
*NL*
of
the
eyes
of
the
young
fisherman
,
whom
I
discovered
not
far
off
.
*NL*
One
face
,
and
not
an
agreeable
one
,
though
it
was
handsome
,
seemed
*NL*
maliciously
watchful
of
this
pretty
girl
,
and
indeed
of
every
one
and
*NL*
everything
there
.
It
was
a
Frenchwoman
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
bell
was
yet
ringing
and
the
great
people
were
not
yet
come
,
I
*NL*
had
leisure
to
glance
over
the
church
,
which
smelt
as
earthy
as
a
*NL*
grave
,
and
to
think
what
a
shady
,
ancient
,
solemn
little
church
it
*NL*
was
.
The
windows
,
heavily
shaded
by
trees
,
admitted
a
subdued
light
*NL*
that
made
the
faces
around
me
pale
,
and
darkened
the
old
brasses
in
*NL*
the
pavement
and
the
time
and
damp-worn
monuments
,
and
rendered
the
*NL*
sunshine
in
the
little
porch
,
where
a
monotonous
ringer
was
working
*NL*
at
the
bell
,
inestimably
bright
.
But
a
stir
in
that
direction
,
a
*NL*
gathering
of
reverential
awe
in
the
rustic
faces
,
and
a
blandly
*NL*
ferocious
assumption
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Boythorn
of
being
resolutely
*NL*
unconscious
of
somebody
's
existence
forewarned
me
that
the
great
*NL*
people
were
come
and
that
the
service
was
going
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Enter
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant
,
O
Lord
,
for
in
thy
*NL*
sight
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
I
ever
forget
the
rapid
beating
at
my
heart
,
occasioned
by
the
*NL*
look
I
met
as
I
stood
up
!
Shall
I
ever
forget
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
those
handsome
proud
eyes
seemed
to
spring
out
of
their
languor
and
*NL*
to
hold
mine
!
It
was
only
a
moment
before
I
cast
mine
down
--
released
*NL*
again
,
if
I
may
say
so
--
on
my
book
;
but
I
knew
the
beautiful
face
*NL*
quite
well
in
that
short
space
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
very
strangely
,
there
was
something
quickened
within
me
,
*NL*
associated
with
the
lonely
days
at
my
godmother
's
;
yes
,
away
even
to
*NL*
the
days
when
I
had
stood
on
tiptoe
to
dress
myself
at
my
little
*NL*
glass
after
dressing
my
doll
.
And
this
,
although
I
had
never
seen
*NL*
this
lady
's
face
before
in
all
my
life
--
I
was
quite
sure
of
*NL*
it
--
absolutely
certain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
know
that
the
ceremonious
,
gouty
,
grey-haired
*NL*
gentleman
,
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
great
pew
,
was
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
,
and
that
the
lady
was
Lady
Dedlock
.
But
why
her
*NL*
face
should
be
,
in
a
confused
way
,
like
a
broken
glass
to
me
,
in
*NL*
which
I
saw
scraps
of
old
remembrances
,
and
why
I
should
be
so
*NL*
fluttered
and
troubled
-LRB-
for
I
was
still
-RRB-
by
having
casually
met
her
*NL*
eyes
,
I
could
not
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
it
to
be
an
unmeaning
weakness
in
me
and
tried
to
overcome
it
*NL*
by
attending
to
the
words
I
heard
.
Then
,
very
strangely
,
I
seemed
to
*NL*
hear
them
,
not
in
the
reader
's
voice
,
but
in
the
well-remembered
*NL*
voice
of
my
godmother
.
This
made
me
think
,
did
Lady
Dedlock
's
face
*NL*
accidentally
resemble
my
godmother
's
?
It
might
be
that
it
did
,
a
*NL*
little
;
but
the
expression
was
so
different
,
and
the
stern
decision
*NL*
which
had
worn
into
my
godmother
's
face
,
like
weather
into
rocks
,
was
*NL*
so
completely
wanting
in
the
face
before
me
that
it
could
not
be
that
*NL*
resemblance
which
had
struck
me
.
Neither
did
I
know
the
loftiness
and
*NL*
haughtiness
of
Lady
Dedlock
's
face
,
at
all
,
in
any
one
.
And
yet
I
--
I
,
*NL*
little
Esther
Summerson
,
the
child
who
lived
a
life
apart
and
on
*NL*
whose
birthday
there
was
no
rejoicing
--
seemed
to
arise
before
my
own
*NL*
eyes
,
evoked
out
of
the
past
by
some
power
in
this
fashionable
lady
,
*NL*
whom
I
not
only
entertained
no
fancy
that
I
had
ever
seen
,
but
whom
I
*NL*
perfectly
well
knew
I
had
never
seen
until
that
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
tremble
so
to
be
thrown
into
this
unaccountable
agitation
*NL*
that
I
was
conscious
of
being
distressed
even
by
the
observation
of
*NL*
the
French
maid
,
though
I
knew
she
had
been
looking
watchfully
here
,
*NL*
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
from
the
moment
of
her
coming
into
the
*NL*
church
.
By
degrees
,
though
very
slowly
,
I
at
last
overcame
my
strange
*NL*
emotion
.
After
a
long
time
,
I
looked
towards
Lady
Dedlock
again
.
It
*NL*
was
while
they
were
preparing
to
sing
,
before
the
sermon
.
She
took
no
*NL*
heed
of
me
,
and
the
beating
at
my
heart
was
gone
.
Neither
did
it
*NL*
revive
for
more
than
a
few
moments
when
she
once
or
twice
afterwards
*NL*
glanced
at
Ada
or
at
me
through
her
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
service
being
concluded
,
Sir
Leicester
gave
his
arm
with
much
*NL*
taste
and
gallantry
to
Lady
Dedlock
--
though
he
was
obliged
to
walk
by
*NL*
the
help
of
a
thick
stick
--
and
escorted
her
out
of
church
to
the
pony
*NL*
carriage
in
which
they
had
come
.
The
servants
then
dispersed
,
and
so
*NL*
did
the
congregation
,
whom
Sir
Leicester
had
contemplated
all
along
*NL*
-LRB-
Mr.
Skimpole
said
to
Mr.
Boythorn
's
infinite
delight
-RRB-
as
if
he
were
*NL*
a
considerable
landed
proprietor
in
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
believes
he
is
!
''
said
Mr.
Boythorn
.
``
He
firmly
believes
it
.
So
*NL*
did
his
father
,
and
his
grandfather
,
and
his
great-grandfather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Skimpole
very
unexpectedly
to
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
,
``
it
's
agreeable
to
me
to
see
a
man
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
IS
it
!
''
said
Mr.
Boythorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
that
he
wants
to
patronize
me
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
Very
*NL*
well
!
I
do
n't
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

''
said
Mr.
Boythorn
with
great
vigour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
?
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
in
his
easy
light
vein
.
``
But
*NL*
that
's
taking
trouble
,
surely
.
And
why
should
you
take
trouble
?
Here
*NL*
am
I
,
content
to
receive
things
childishly
as
they
fall
out
,
and
I
*NL*
never
take
trouble
!
I
come
down
here
,
for
instance
,
and
I
find
a
*NL*
mighty
potentate
exacting
homage
.
Very
well
!
I
say
`
Mighty
potentate
,
*NL*
here
IS
my
homage
!
It
's
easier
to
give
it
than
to
withhold
it
.
Here
*NL*
it
is
.
If
you
have
anything
of
an
agreeable
nature
to
show
me
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
happy
to
see
it

an
agreeable
nature

I
shall

happy

Mighty
potentate
replies
*NL*
in
effect
,
`
This
is
a
sensible
fellow
.
I
find
him
accord
with
my
*NL*
digestion
and
my
bilious
system

He
does
n't
impose
upon
me
the
*NL*
necessity
of
rolling
myself
up
like
a
hedgehog
with
my
points
*NL*
outward
.
I
expand
,
I
open
,
I
turn
my
silver
lining
outward
like
*NL*
Milton
's
cloud
,
and
it
's
more
agreeable
to
both
of
us
.
'
That
's
my
*NL*
view
of
such
things
,
speaking
as
a
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
you
went
down
somewhere
else
to-morrow
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Boythorn
,
``
where
there
was
the
opposite

*NL*
fellow

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
then

said
Mr.
Skimpole
with
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
*NL*
simplicity
and
candour
.
``
Just
the
same
then

I
should
say

esteemed

to
make

So
do

I
take
it
that
my
business

object

I
object

us
go

our

swelling

growing
very
red

cried
Mr.
Boythorn
in
a
violent
burst
and
*NL*
stopping
to
strike
his
stick
upon
the
ground
.
``
And
he
would
probably

add

Is
there
such
a

*NL*
``
To

Harold
Skimpole
would

he
returned
in
his

gayest
manner
and
with
his
most
ingenuous
smile
,
''
`
Upon
my

I
*NL*
have
not

I
do

call
by

name

where
it
is

who
possesses
it

If
you
possess
it

find

it
comfortable
,
I
am
quite
delighted

congratulate
you
heartily

*NL*
But
I
know
nothing
about

I
assure
you

I
am
a
mere
child

*NL*
I
lay
no
claim

it

I
do
n't
want
it

So

you
see

excellent
*NL*
Boythorn

I
would
go
to
dinner
after
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
one
of
many
little
dialogues
between
them
which
I
always
*NL*
expected
to
end
,
and
which
I
dare
say
would
have
ended
under
other
*NL*
circumstances
,
in
some
violent
explosion
on
the
part
of
our
host
.
But
*NL*
he
had
so
high
a
sense
of
his
hospitable
and
responsible
position
as
*NL*
our
entertainer
,
and
my
guardian
laughed
so
sincerely
at
and
with
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
,
as
a
child
who
blew
bubbles
and
broke
them
all
day
long
,
*NL*
that
matters
never
went
beyond
this
point
.
Mr.
Skimpole
,
who
always
*NL*
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
having
been
on
delicate
ground
,
then
*NL*
betook
himself
to
beginning
some
sketch
in
the
park
which
he
never
*NL*
finished
,
or
to
playing
fragments
of
airs
on
the
piano
,
or
to
singing
*NL*
scraps
of
songs
,
or
to
lying
down
on
his
back
under
a
tree
and
*NL*
looking
at
the
sky
--
which
he
could
n't
help
thinking
,
he
said
,
was
*NL*
what
he
was
meant
for
;
it
suited
him
so
exactly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enterprise
and
effort
,
''
he
would
say
to
us
-LRB-
on
his
back
-RRB-
,
``
are
*NL*
delightful
to
me
.
I
believe
I
am
truly
cosmopolitan
.
I
have
the
*NL*
deepest
sympathy
with
them
.
I
lie
in
a
shady
place
like
this
and
*NL*
think
of
adventurous
spirits
going
to
the
North
Pole
or
penetrating
*NL*
to
the
heart
of
the
Torrid
Zone
with
admiration
.
Mercenary
creatures
*NL*
ask
,
`
What
is
the
use
of
a
man
's
going
to
the
North
Pole
?
What
good
*NL*
does
it
do
?
'
I
ca
n't
say
;
but
,
for
anything
I
CAN
say
,
he
may
go
for
*NL*
the
purpose
--
though
he
do
n't
know
it
--
of
employing
my
thoughts
as
I
*NL*
lie
here
.
Take
an
extreme
case
.
Take
the
case
of
the
slaves
on
*NL*
American
plantations
.
I
dare
say
they
are
worked
hard
,
I
dare
say
*NL*
they
do
n't
altogether
like
it
.
I
dare
say
theirs
is
an
unpleasant
*NL*
experience
on
the
whole
;
but
they
people
the
landscape
for
me
,
they
*NL*
give
it
a
poetry
for
me
,
and
perhaps
that
is
one
of
the
pleasanter
*NL*
objects
of
their
existence
.
I
am
very
sensible
of
it
,
if
it
be
,
and
I
*NL*
should
n't
wonder
if
it
were
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
always
wondered
on
these
occasions
whether
he
ever
thought
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Skimpole
and
the
children
,
and
in
what
point
of
view
they
presented
*NL*
themselves
to
his
cosmopolitan
mind
.
So
far
as
I
could
understand
,
*NL*
they
rarely
presented
themselves
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
week
had
gone
round
to
the
Saturday
following
that
beating
of
my
*NL*
heart
in
the
church
;
and
every
day
had
been
so
bright
and
blue
that
*NL*
to
ramble
in
the
woods
,
and
to
see
the
light
striking
down
among
the
*NL*
transparent
leaves
and
sparkling
in
the
beautiful
interlacings
of
the
*NL*
shadows
of
the
trees
,
while
the
birds
poured
out
their
songs
and
the
*NL*
air
was
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
insects
,
had
been
most
delightful
.
We
*NL*
had
one
favourite
spot
,
deep
in
moss
and
last
year
's
leaves
,
where
*NL*
there
were
some
felled
trees
from
which
the
bark
was
all
stripped
*NL*
off
.
Seated
among
these
,
we
looked
through
a
green
vista
supported
by
*NL*
thousands
of
natural
columns
,
the
whitened
stems
of
trees
,
upon
a
*NL*
distant
prospect
made
so
radiant
by
its
contrast
with
the
shade
in
*NL*
which
we
sat
and
made
so
precious
by
the
arched
perspective
through
*NL*
which
we
saw
it
that
it
was
like
a
glimpse
of
the
better
land
.
Upon
*NL*
the
Saturday
we
sat
here
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
Ada
,
and
I
,
until
we
heard
*NL*
thunder
muttering
in
the
distance
and
felt
the
large
raindrops
rattle
*NL*
through
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
had
been
all
the
week
extremely
sultry
,
but
the
storm
*NL*
broke
so
suddenly
--
upon
us
,
at
least
,
in
that
sheltered
spot
--
that
*NL*
before
we
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
the
thunder
and
lightning
*NL*
were
frequent
and
the
rain
came
plunging
through
the
leaves
as
if
*NL*
every
drop
were
a
great
leaden
bead
.
As
it
was
not
a
time
for
*NL*
standing
among
trees
,
we
ran
out
of
the
wood
,
and
up
and
down
the
*NL*
moss-grown
steps
which
crossed
the
plantation-fence
like
two
*NL*
broad-staved
ladders
placed
back
to
back
,
and
made
for
a
keeper
's
*NL*
lodge
which
was
close
at
hand
.
We
had
often
noticed
the
dark
beauty
*NL*
of
this
lodge
standing
in
a
deep
twilight
of
trees
,
and
how
the
ivy
*NL*
clustered
over
it
,
and
how
there
was
a
steep
hollow
near
,
where
we
*NL*
had
once
seen
the
keeper
's
dog
dive
down
into
the
fern
as
if
it
were
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodge
was
so
dark
within
,
now
the
sky
was
overcast
,
that
we
only
*NL*
clearly
saw
the
man
who
came
to
the
door
when
we
took
shelter
there
*NL*
and
put
two
chairs
for
Ada
and
me
.
The
lattice-windows
were
all
*NL*
thrown
open
,
and
we
sat
just
within
the
doorway
watching
the
storm
.
*NL*
It
was
grand
to
see
how
the
wind
awoke
,
and
bent
the
trees
,
and
drove
*NL*
the
rain
before
it
like
a
cloud
of
smoke
;
and
to
hear
the
solemn
*NL*
thunder
and
to
see
the
lightning
;
and
while
thinking
with
awe
of
the
*NL*
tremendous
powers
by
which
our
little
lives
are
encompassed
,
to
*NL*
consider
how
beneficent
they
are
and
how
upon
the
smallest
flower
and
*NL*
leaf
there
was
already
a
freshness
poured
from
all
this
seeming
rage
*NL*
which
seemed
to
make
creation
new
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
dangerous
to
sit
in
so
exposed
a
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Esther
dear
!
''
said
Ada
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
said
it
to
me
,
but
I
had
not
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beating
of
my
heart
came
back
again
.
I
had
never
heard
the
voice
,
*NL*
as
I
had
never
seen
the
face
,
but
it
affected
me
in
the
same
strange
*NL*
way
.
Again
,
in
a
moment
,
there
arose
before
my
mind
innumerable
*NL*
pictures
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
had
taken
shelter
in
the
lodge
before
our
arrival
there
*NL*
and
had
come
out
of
the
gloom
within
.
She
stood
behind
my
chair
with
*NL*
her
hand
upon
it
.
I
saw
her
with
her
hand
close
to
my
shoulder
when
I
*NL*
turned
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
frightened
you
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
It
was
not
fright
.
Why
should
I
be
frightened
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
''
said
Lady
Dedlock
to
my
guardian
,
``
I
have
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
speaking
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
remembrance
does
me
more
honour
than
I
had
supposed
it
would
,
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recognized
you
in
church
on
Sunday
.
I
am
sorry
that
any
local
*NL*
disputes
of
Sir
Leicester
's
--
they
are
not
of
his
seeking
,
however
,
I
*NL*
believe
--
should
render
it
a
matter
of
some
absurd
difficulty
to
show
*NL*
you
any
attention
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
aware
of
the
circumstances
,
''
returned
my
guardian
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
``
and
am
sufficiently
obliged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
given
him
her
hand
in
an
indifferent
way
that
seemed
habitual
*NL*
to
her
and
spoke
in
a
correspondingly
indifferent
manner
,
though
in
a
*NL*
very
pleasant
voice
.
She
was
as
graceful
as
she
was
beautiful
,
*NL*
perfectly
self-possessed
,
and
had
the
air
,
I
thought
,
of
being
able
*NL*
to
attract
and
interest
any
one
if
she
had
thought
it
worth
her
*NL*
while
.
The
keeper
had
brought
her
a
chair
on
which
she
sat
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
porch
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
young
gentleman
disposed
of
whom
you
wrote
to
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
about
and
whose
wishes
Sir
Leicester
was
sorry
not
to
have
it
in
his
*NL*
power
to
advance
in
any
way
?
''
she
said
over
her
shoulder
to
my
*NL*
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
respect
him
and
even
to
wish
to
conciliate
him
.
There
*NL*
was
something
very
winning
in
her
haughty
manner
,
and
it
became
more
*NL*
familiar
--
I
was
going
to
say
more
easy
,
but
that
could
hardly
be
--
as
*NL*
she
spoke
to
him
over
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
this
is
your
other
ward
,
Miss
Clare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
presented
Ada
,
in
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
lose
the
disinterested
part
of
your
Don
Quixote
character
,
''
*NL*
said
Lady
Dedlock
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
over
her
shoulder
again
,
``
if
you
*NL*
only
redress
the
wrongs
of
beauty
like
this
.
But
present
me
,
''
and
she
*NL*
turned
full
upon
me
,
``
to
this
young
lady
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
really
is
my
ward
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
I
am
*NL*
responsible
to
no
Lord
Chancellor
in
her
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Miss
Summerson
lost
both
her
parents
?
''
said
my
Lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
fortunate
in
her
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
looked
at
me
,
and
I
looked
at
her
and
said
I
was
indeed
.
*NL*
All
at
once
she
turned
from
me
with
a
hasty
air
,
almost
expressive
of
*NL*
displeasure
or
dislike
,
and
spoke
to
him
over
her
shoulder
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ages
have
passed
since
we
were
in
the
habit
of
meeting
,
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
long
time
.
At
least
I
thought
it
was
a
long
time
,
until
I
saw
you
*NL*
last
Sunday
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Even
you
are
a
courtier
,
or
think
it
necessary
to
become
one
*NL*
to
me
!
''
she
said
with
some
disdain
.
``
I
have
achieved
that
reputation
,
*NL*
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
achieved
so
much
,
Lady
Dedlock
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
that
*NL*
you
pay
some
little
penalty
,
I
dare
say
.
But
none
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
!
''
she
repeated
,
slightly
laughing
.
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
air
of
superiority
,
and
power
,
and
fascination
,
and
I
know
*NL*
not
what
,
she
seemed
to
regard
Ada
and
me
as
little
more
than
*NL*
children
.
So
,
as
she
slightly
laughed
and
afterwards
sat
looking
at
*NL*
the
rain
,
she
was
as
self-possessed
and
as
free
to
occupy
herself
*NL*
with
her
own
thoughts
as
if
she
had
been
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
knew
my
sister
when
we
were
abroad
together
better
than
*NL*
you
know
me
?
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
happened
to
meet
oftener
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
went
our
several
ways
,
''
said
Lady
Dedlock
,
``
and
had
little
in
*NL*
common
even
before
we
agreed
to
differ
.
It
is
to
be
regretted
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
but
it
could
not
be
helped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
again
sat
looking
at
the
rain
.
The
storm
soon
began
to
*NL*
pass
upon
its
way
.
The
shower
greatly
abated
,
the
lightning
ceased
,
*NL*
the
thunder
rolled
among
the
distant
hills
,
and
the
sun
began
to
*NL*
glisten
on
the
wet
leaves
and
the
falling
rain
.
As
we
sat
there
,
*NL*
silently
,
we
saw
a
little
pony
phaeton
coming
towards
us
at
a
merry
*NL*
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
messenger
is
coming
back
,
my
Lady
,
''
said
the
keeper
,
``
with
the
*NL*
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
drove
up
,
we
saw
that
there
were
two
people
inside
.
There
*NL*
alighted
from
it
,
with
some
cloaks
and
wrappers
,
first
the
*NL*
Frenchwoman
whom
I
had
seen
in
church
,
and
secondly
the
pretty
girl
,
*NL*
the
Frenchwoman
with
a
defiant
confidence
,
the
pretty
girl
confused
*NL*
and
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
now
?
''
said
Lady
Dedlock
.
``
Two
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
your
maid
,
my
Lady
,
at
the
present
,
''
said
the
Frenchwoman
.
``
The
*NL*
message
was
for
the
attendant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
you
might
mean
me
,
my
Lady
,
''
said
the
pretty
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
mean
you
,
child
,
''
replied
her
mistress
calmly
.
``
Put
that
shawl
*NL*
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
slightly
stooped
her
shoulders
to
receive
it
,
and
the
pretty
girl
*NL*
lightly
dropped
it
in
its
place
.
The
Frenchwoman
stood
unnoticed
,
*NL*
looking
on
with
her
lips
very
tightly
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
''
said
Lady
Dedlock
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
that
we
are
not
*NL*
likely
to
renew
our
former
acquaintance
.
You
will
allow
me
to
send
*NL*
the
carriage
back
for
your
two
wards
.
It
shall
be
here
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
he
would
on
no
account
accept
this
offer
,
she
took
a
graceful
*NL*
leave
of
Ada
--
none
of
me
--
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
proffered
arm
,
*NL*
and
got
into
the
carriage
,
which
was
a
little
,
low
,
park
carriage
*NL*
with
a
hood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
child
,
''
she
said
to
the
pretty
girl
;
``
I
shall
want
you
.
Go
*NL*
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
rolled
away
,
and
the
Frenchwoman
,
with
the
wrappers
she
*NL*
had
brought
hanging
over
her
arm
,
remained
standing
where
she
had
*NL*
alighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
there
is
nothing
pride
can
so
little
bear
with
as
pride
*NL*
itself
,
and
that
she
was
punished
for
her
imperious
manner
.
Her
*NL*
retaliation
was
the
most
singular
I
could
have
imagined
.
She
remained
*NL*
perfectly
still
until
the
carriage
had
turned
into
the
drive
,
and
*NL*
then
,
without
the
least
discomposure
of
countenance
,
slipped
off
her
*NL*
shoes
,
left
them
on
the
ground
,
and
walked
deliberately
in
the
same
*NL*
direction
through
the
wettest
of
the
wet
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
young
woman
mad
?
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
sir
!
''
said
the
keeper
,
who
,
with
his
wife
,
was
looking
after
*NL*
her
.
``
Hortense
is
not
one
of
that
sort
.
She
has
as
good
a
head-piece
*NL*
as
the
best
.
But
she
's
mortal
high
and
passionate
--
powerful
high
and
*NL*
passionate
;
and
what
with
having
notice
to
leave
,
and
having
others
*NL*
put
above
her
,
she
do
n't
take
kindly
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
she
walk
shoeless
through
all
that
water
?
''
said
my
*NL*
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
indeed
,
sir
,
unless
it
is
to
cool
her
down
!
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
unless
she
fancies
it
's
blood
,
''
said
the
woman
.
``
She
'd
as
soon
*NL*
walk
through
that
as
anything
else
,
I
think
,
when
her
own
's
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
not
far
from
the
house
a
few
minutes
afterwards
.
Peaceful
*NL*
as
it
had
looked
when
we
first
saw
it
,
it
looked
even
more
so
now
,
*NL*
with
a
diamond
spray
glittering
all
about
it
,
a
light
wind
blowing
,
*NL*
the
birds
no
longer
hushed
but
singing
strongly
,
everything
refreshed
*NL*
by
the
late
rain
,
and
the
little
carriage
shining
at
the
doorway
like
*NL*
a
fairy
carriage
made
of
silver
.
Still
,
very
steadfastly
and
quietly
*NL*
walking
towards
it
,
a
peaceful
figure
too
in
the
landscape
,
went
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Hortense
,
shoeless
,
through
the
wet
grass
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
Moving
On
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
long
vacation
in
the
regions
of
Chancery
Lane
.
The
good
*NL*
ships
Law
and
Equity
,
those
teak-built
,
copper-bottomed
,
*NL*
iron-fastened
,
brazen-faced
,
and
not
by
any
means
fast-sailing
*NL*
clippers
are
laid
up
in
ordinary
.
The
Flying
Dutchman
,
with
a
crew
of
*NL*
ghostly
clients
imploring
all
whom
they
may
encounter
to
peruse
their
*NL*
papers
,
has
drifted
,
for
the
time
being
,
heaven
knows
where
.
The
*NL*
courts
are
all
shut
up
;
the
public
offices
lie
in
a
hot
sleep
.
*NL*
Westminster
Hall
itself
is
a
shady
solitude
where
nightingales
might
*NL*
sing
,
and
a
tenderer
class
of
suitors
than
is
usually
found
there
,
*NL*
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Temple
,
Chancery
Lane
,
Serjeants
'
Inn
,
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
even
*NL*
unto
the
Fields
are
like
tidal
harbours
at
low
water
,
where
stranded
*NL*
proceedings
,
offices
at
anchor
,
idle
clerks
lounging
on
lop-sided
*NL*
stools
that
will
not
recover
their
perpendicular
until
the
current
of
*NL*
Term
sets
in
,
lie
high
and
dry
upon
the
ooze
of
the
long
vacation
.
*NL*
Outer
doors
of
chambers
are
shut
up
by
the
score
,
messages
and
*NL*
parcels
are
to
be
left
at
the
Porter
's
Lodge
by
the
bushel
.
A
crop
of
*NL*
grass
would
grow
in
the
chinks
of
the
stone
pavement
outside
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
Hall
,
but
that
the
ticket-porters
,
who
have
nothing
to
*NL*
do
beyond
sitting
in
the
shade
there
,
with
their
white
aprons
over
*NL*
their
heads
to
keep
the
flies
off
,
grub
it
up
and
eat
it
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
only
one
judge
in
town
.
Even
he
only
comes
twice
a
week
to
*NL*
sit
in
chambers
.
If
the
country
folks
of
those
assize
towns
on
his
*NL*
circuit
could
see
him
now
!
No
full-bottomed
wig
,
no
red
petticoats
,
*NL*
no
fur
,
no
javelin-men
,
no
white
wands
.
Merely
a
close-shaved
*NL*
gentleman
in
white
trousers
and
a
white
hat
,
with
sea-bronze
on
the
*NL*
judicial
countenance
,
and
a
strip
of
bark
peeled
by
the
solar
rays
*NL*
from
the
judicial
nose
,
who
calls
in
at
the
shell-fish
shop
as
he
*NL*
comes
along
and
drinks
iced
ginger-beer
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
bar
of
England
is
scattered
over
the
face
of
the
earth
.
How
*NL*
England
can
get
on
through
four
long
summer
months
without
its
*NL*
bar
--
which
is
its
acknowledged
refuge
in
adversity
and
its
only
*NL*
legitimate
triumph
in
prosperity
--
is
beside
the
question
;
assuredly
*NL*
that
shield
and
buckler
of
Britannia
are
not
in
present
wear
.
The
*NL*
learned
gentleman
who
is
always
so
tremendously
indignant
at
the
*NL*
unprecedented
outrage
committed
on
the
feelings
of
his
client
by
the
*NL*
opposite
party
that
he
never
seems
likely
to
recover
it
is
doing
*NL*
infinitely
better
than
might
be
expected
in
Switzerland
.
The
learned
*NL*
gentleman
who
does
the
withering
business
and
who
blights
all
*NL*
opponents
with
his
gloomy
sarcasm
is
as
merry
as
a
grig
at
a
French
*NL*
watering-place
.
The
learned
gentleman
who
weeps
by
the
pint
on
the
*NL*
smallest
provocation
has
not
shed
a
tear
these
six
weeks
.
The
very
*NL*
learned
gentleman
who
has
cooled
the
natural
heat
of
his
gingery
*NL*
complexion
in
pools
and
fountains
of
law
until
he
has
become
great
in
*NL*
knotty
arguments
for
term-time
,
when
he
poses
the
drowsy
bench
with
*NL*
legal
``
chaff
,
''
inexplicable
to
the
uninitiated
and
to
most
of
the
*NL*
initiated
too
,
is
roaming
,
with
a
characteristic
delight
in
aridity
*NL*
and
dust
,
about
Constantinople
.
Other
dispersed
fragments
of
the
same
*NL*
great
palladium
are
to
be
found
on
the
canals
of
Venice
,
at
the
*NL*
second
cataract
of
the
Nile
,
in
the
baths
of
Germany
,
and
sprinkled
*NL*
on
the
sea-sand
all
over
the
English
coast
.
Scarcely
one
is
to
be
*NL*
encountered
in
the
deserted
region
of
Chancery
Lane
.
If
such
a
lonely
*NL*
member
of
the
bar
do
flit
across
the
waste
and
come
upon
a
prowling
*NL*
suitor
who
is
unable
to
leave
off
haunting
the
scenes
of
his
anxiety
,
*NL*
they
frighten
one
another
and
retreat
into
opposite
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
hottest
long
vacation
known
for
many
years
.
All
the
young
*NL*
clerks
are
madly
in
love
,
and
according
to
their
various
degrees
,
*NL*
pine
for
bliss
with
the
beloved
object
,
at
Margate
,
Ramsgate
,
or
*NL*
Gravesend
.
All
the
middle-aged
clerks
think
their
families
too
large
.
*NL*
All
the
unowned
dogs
who
stray
into
the
Inns
of
Court
and
pant
about
*NL*
staircases
and
other
dry
places
seeking
water
give
short
howls
of
*NL*
aggravation
.
All
the
blind
men
's
dogs
in
the
streets
draw
their
*NL*
masters
against
pumps
or
trip
them
over
buckets
.
A
shop
with
a
*NL*
sun-blind
,
and
a
watered
pavement
,
and
a
bowl
of
gold
and
silver
fish
*NL*
in
the
window
,
is
a
sanctuary
.
Temple
Bar
gets
so
hot
that
it
is
,
to
*NL*
the
adjacent
Strand
and
Fleet
Street
,
what
a
heater
is
in
an
urn
,
and
*NL*
keeps
them
simmering
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
offices
about
the
Inns
of
Court
in
which
a
man
might
be
*NL*
cool
,
if
any
coolness
were
worth
purchasing
at
such
a
price
in
*NL*
dullness
;
but
the
little
thoroughfares
immediately
outside
those
*NL*
retirements
seem
to
blaze
.
In
Mr.
Krook
's
court
,
it
is
so
hot
that
*NL*
the
people
turn
their
houses
inside
out
and
sit
in
chairs
upon
the
*NL*
pavement
--
Mr.
Krook
included
,
who
there
pursues
his
studies
,
with
his
*NL*
cat
-LRB-
who
never
is
too
hot
-RRB-
by
his
side
.
The
Sol
's
Arms
has
*NL*
discontinued
the
Harmonic
Meetings
for
the
season
,
and
Little
Swills
*NL*
is
engaged
at
the
Pastoral
Gardens
down
the
river
,
where
he
comes
out
*NL*
in
quite
an
innocent
manner
and
sings
comic
ditties
of
a
juvenile
*NL*
complexion
calculated
-LRB-
as
the
bill
says
-RRB-
not
to
wound
the
feelings
of
*NL*
the
most
fastidious
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
all
the
legal
neighbourhood
there
hangs
,
like
some
great
veil
of
*NL*
rust
or
gigantic
cobweb
,
the
idleness
and
pensiveness
of
the
long
*NL*
vacation
.
Mr.
Snagsby
,
law-stationer
of
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
*NL*
Street
,
is
sensible
of
the
influence
not
only
in
his
mind
as
a
*NL*
sympathetic
and
contemplative
man
,
but
also
in
his
business
as
a
*NL*
law-stationer
aforesaid
.
He
has
more
leisure
for
musing
in
Staple
Inn
*NL*
and
in
the
Rolls
Yard
during
the
long
vacation
than
at
other
seasons
,
*NL*
and
he
says
to
the
two
`
prentices
,
what
a
thing
it
is
in
such
hot
*NL*
weather
to
think
that
you
live
in
an
island
with
the
sea
a-rolling
*NL*
and
a-bowling
right
round
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guster
is
busy
in
the
little
drawing-room
on
this
present
afternoon
*NL*
in
the
long
vacation
,
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
have
it
in
*NL*
contemplation
to
receive
company
.
The
expected
guests
are
rather
*NL*
select
than
numerous
,
being
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Chadband
and
no
more
.
From
*NL*
Mr.
Chadband
's
being
much
given
to
describe
himself
,
both
verbally
*NL*
and
in
writing
,
as
a
vessel
,
he
is
occasionally
mistaken
by
strangers
*NL*
for
a
gentleman
connected
with
navigation
,
but
he
is
,
as
he
expresses
*NL*
it
,
``
in
the
ministry
.
''
Mr.
Chadband
is
attached
to
no
particular
*NL*
denomination
and
is
considered
by
his
persecutors
to
have
nothing
so
*NL*
very
remarkable
to
say
on
the
greatest
of
subjects
as
to
render
his
*NL*
volunteering
,
on
his
own
account
,
at
all
incumbent
on
his
conscience
;
*NL*
but
he
has
his
followers
,
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
is
of
the
number
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
has
but
recently
taken
a
passage
upward
by
the
vessel
,
*NL*
Chadband
;
and
her
attention
was
attracted
to
that
Bark
A
1
,
when
she
*NL*
was
something
flushed
by
the
hot
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
woman
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
to
the
sparrows
in
Staple
Inn
,
*NL*
``
likes
to
have
her
religion
rather
sharp
,
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Guster
,
much
impressed
by
regarding
herself
for
the
time
as
the
*NL*
handmaid
of
Chadband
,
whom
she
knows
to
be
endowed
with
the
gift
of
*NL*
holding
forth
for
four
hours
at
a
stretch
,
prepares
the
little
*NL*
drawing-room
for
tea
.
All
the
furniture
is
shaken
and
dusted
,
the
*NL*
portraits
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
are
touched
up
with
a
wet
cloth
,
*NL*
the
best
tea-service
is
set
forth
,
and
there
is
excellent
provision
*NL*
made
of
dainty
new
bread
,
crusty
twists
,
cool
fresh
butter
,
thin
*NL*
slices
of
ham
,
tongue
,
and
German
sausage
,
and
delicate
little
rows
*NL*
of
anchovies
nestling
in
parsley
,
not
to
mention
new-laid
eggs
,
to
be
*NL*
brought
up
warm
in
a
napkin
,
and
hot
buttered
toast
.
For
Chadband
is
*NL*
rather
a
consuming
vessel
--
the
persecutors
say
a
gorging
vessel
--
and
*NL*
can
wield
such
weapons
of
the
flesh
as
a
knife
and
fork
remarkably
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
in
his
best
coat
,
looking
at
all
the
preparations
when
*NL*
they
are
completed
and
coughing
his
cough
of
deference
behind
his
*NL*
hand
,
says
to
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
``
At
what
time
did
you
expect
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Chadband
,
my
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
six
,
''
says
Mrs.
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
observes
in
a
mild
and
casual
way
that
``
it
's
gone
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
'd
like
to
begin
without
them
,
''
is
Mrs.
Snagsby
's
*NL*
reproachful
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
does
look
as
if
he
would
like
it
very
much
,
but
he
says
,
*NL*
with
his
cough
of
mildness
,
``
No
,
my
dear
,
no
.
I
merely
named
the
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
time
,
''
says
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
``
to
eternity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
my
dear
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
.
``
Only
when
a
person
lays
in
*NL*
victuals
for
tea
,
a
person
does
it
with
a
view
--
perhaps
--
more
to
*NL*
time
.
And
when
a
time
is
named
for
having
tea
,
it
's
better
to
come
up
*NL*
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
come
up
to
it
!
''
Mrs.
Snagsby
repeats
with
severity
.
``
Up
to
it
!
As
*NL*
if
Mr.
Chadband
was
a
fighter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
Guster
,
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
bedroom
window
,
comes
*NL*
rustling
and
scratching
down
the
little
staircase
like
a
popular
*NL*
ghost
,
and
falling
flushed
into
the
drawing-room
,
announces
that
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Chadband
have
appeared
in
the
court
.
The
bell
at
the
inner
*NL*
door
in
the
passage
immediately
thereafter
tinkling
,
she
is
*NL*
admonished
by
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
on
pain
of
instant
reconsignment
to
her
*NL*
patron
saint
,
not
to
omit
the
ceremony
of
announcement
.
Much
*NL*
discomposed
in
her
nerves
-LRB-
which
were
previously
in
the
best
order
-RRB-
*NL*
by
this
threat
,
she
so
fearfully
mutilates
that
point
of
state
as
to
*NL*
announce
``
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cheeseming
,
least
which
,
Imeantersay
,
*NL*
whatsername
!
''
and
retires
conscience-stricken
from
the
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chadband
is
a
large
yellow
man
with
a
fat
smile
and
a
general
*NL*
appearance
of
having
a
good
deal
of
train
oil
in
his
system
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Chadband
is
a
stern
,
severe-looking
,
silent
woman
.
Mr.
Chadband
moves
*NL*
softly
and
cumbrously
,
not
unlike
a
bear
who
has
been
taught
to
walk
*NL*
upright
.
He
is
very
much
embarrassed
about
the
arms
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
inconvenient
to
him
and
he
wanted
to
grovel
,
is
very
much
in
a
*NL*
perspiration
about
the
head
,
and
never
speaks
without
first
putting
*NL*
up
his
great
hand
,
as
delivering
a
token
to
his
hearers
that
he
is
*NL*
going
to
edify
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friends

says
Mr.
Chadband
,
``
peace

*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
of
Mrs.
Snagsby
looking
deeply
edified
,
Mr.
Snagsby
*NL*
thinks
it
expedient
on
the
whole
to
say
amen
,
which
is
well
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

proceeds
Mr.

,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Guster
presents
herself
.
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
in
a
spectral
bass
voice
and
*NL*
without
removing
her
eyes
from
Chadband
,
says
with
dreadful
*NL*
distinctness
,
``
Go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Guster
is
heard
unaccountably
to
murmur
``
one

eighty-two

The
spectral
voice
repeats
more
solemnly
,
``
Go

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Still
Guster
reiterates
``

seven
hundred

eighty-two

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chadband
,
pausing
with
the
resignation
of
a
man
accustomed
to
be
*NL*
persecuted
and
languidly
folding
up
his
chin
into
his
fat
smile
,
*NL*
says
,
``

breathless
.

*NL*
``

returns
Mrs.

.
``
For

*NL*
*NL*
Guster
replied
that
``
he
insistes
on
one

eightpence

on

summonsizzing
the

''
Mrs.
Snagsby
and
Mrs.
Chadband
are
*NL*
proceeding
to
grow
shrill
in
indignation
when
Mr.
Chadband
quiets
the
*NL*
tumult
by
lifting
up
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

says
he
,
``
I
remember
a
duty
unfulfilled

It

I

*NL*
*NL*
While
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
drawing
her
breath
,
looks
hard
at
Mr.
Snagsby
,
as
*NL*
who
should
say
,
``
You
hear
this
apostle

''
and
while
Mr.
Chadband
glows
*NL*
with
humility
and
train
oil
,
Mrs.
Chadband
pays
the
money
.
It
is
Mr.
*NL*
Chadband
's
habit
--
it
is
the
head
and
front
of
his
pretensions
*NL*
indeed
--
to
keep
this
sort
of
debtor
and
creditor
account
in
the
*NL*
smallest
items

to
post
it
publicly
on
the
most
trivial
occasions

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Chadband

*NL*
*NL*
With
which
remark

which
appears
from
its
sound
to
be
an
extract
in
*NL*
verse
,
Mr.
Chadband
stalks
to
the
table
,
and
before
taking
a
chair
,
*NL*
lifts
up
his
admonitory
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

says
he
,
``

Refreshment

Do

my

We
do

And
why
do
we
need

Because
*NL*
we
are

mortal

because

sinful

because

of

not

Can

We

can

Why
can

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
,
presuming
on
the
success
of
his
last
point
,
ventures
to
*NL*
observe
in
a
cheerful
and
rather
knowing
tone
,
``
No
wings

''
But
is
*NL*
immediately
frowned
down
by
Mrs.
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
my
friends
,
''
pursues
Mr.
Chadband
,
utterly
rejecting
and
*NL*
obliterating
Mr.
Snagsby
's
suggestion
,
``
why
can
we
not
fly
?
Is
it
*NL*
because
we
are
calculated
to
walk

It
is

Could
we
walk

my

*NL*
without
strength

We
could
not

What
should
we
do
without

Our
legs

refuse

our

double

up

our

would
turn
over

we
should
come
to
the

*NL*
Then
from
whence
,
my
friends
,
in
a
human
point
of
view
,
do
we
derive
*NL*
the
strength
that
is
necessary
to
our
limbs
?
Is
it
,
''
says
Chadband
,
*NL*
glancing
over
the
table
,
``
from
bread
in
various
forms

from
butter
*NL*
which
is
churned
from

milk

by

from
the
eggs

are
laid
by

fowl

from

,
from

from

sausage

and
from
such

It
is

Then
let
us
partake
of
the
good
*NL*
things
which
are
set
before

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
persecutors
denied
that
there
was
any
particular
gift
in
Mr.
*NL*
Chadband
's
piling
verbose
flights
of
stairs
,
one
upon
another
,
after
*NL*
this
fashion
.
But
this
can
only
be
received
as
a
proof
of
their
*NL*
determination
to
persecute
,
since
it
must
be
within
everybody
's
*NL*
experience
that
the
Chadband
style
of
oratory
is
widely
received
and
*NL*
much
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chadband
,
however
,
having
concluded
for
the
present
,
sits
down
at
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
's
table
and
lays
about
him
prodigiously
.
The
conversion
*NL*
of
nutriment
of
any
sort
into
oil
of
the
quality
already
mentioned
*NL*
appears
to
be
a
process
so
inseparable
from
the
constitution
of
this
*NL*
exemplary
vessel
that
in
beginning
to
eat
and
drink
,
he
may
be
*NL*
described
as
always
becoming
a
kind
of
considerable
oil
mills
or
*NL*
other
large
factory
for
the
production
of
that
article
on
a
wholesale
*NL*
scale
.
On
the
present
evening
of
the
long
vacation
,
in
Cook
's
Court
,
*NL*
Cursitor
Street
,
he
does
such
a
powerful
stroke
of
business
that
the
*NL*
warehouse
appears
to
be
quite
full
when
the
works
cease
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
period
of
the
entertainment
,
Guster
,
who
has
never
recovered
*NL*
her
first
failure
,
but
has
neglected
no
possible
or
impossible
means
*NL*
of
bringing
the
establishment
and
herself
into
contempt
--
among
which
*NL*
may
be
briefly
enumerated
her
unexpectedly
performing
clashing
*NL*
military
music
on
Mr.
Chadband
's
head
with
plates
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
crowning
that
gentleman
with
muffins
--
at
which
period
of
the
*NL*
entertainment
,
Guster
whispers
Mr.
Snagsby
that
he
is
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
being
wanted
in
the
--
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
--
in
the
*NL*
shop
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
rising
,
``
perhaps
this
good
company
will
*NL*
excuse
me
for
half
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
descends
and
finds
the
two
`
prentices
intently
*NL*
contemplating
a
police
constable
,
who
holds
a
ragged
boy
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
my
heart
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
``
what
's
the
matter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
boy
,
''
says
the
constable
,
``
although
he
's
repeatedly
told
to

*NL*

on
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
always
a-moving
on

cries
the
boy
,
wiping
away
his
grimy
*NL*
tears
with
his
arm
.
``
I
've
always
been
a-moving
and
a-moving
on
,
ever
*NL*
since
I
was
born

Where
can
I
possibly
move
to

,
more
nor
I
do
*NL*
move

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
move
on

''
says
the
constable
calmly
,
with
a
slight
*NL*
professional
hitch
of
his
neck
involving
its
better
settlement
in
his
*NL*
stiff
stock
,
``
although
he
has
been
repeatedly
cautioned
,
and
*NL*
therefore
I
am
obliged
to
take
him
into
custody

He
's
as
obstinate
a
*NL*
young
gonoph
as
I
know
.
He
WO
N'T
move
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
eye
!
Where
can
I
move
to
!
''
cries
the
boy
,
clutching
quite
*NL*
desperately
at
his
hair
and
beating
his
bare
feet
upon
the
floor
of
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
's
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
come
none
of
that
or
I
shall
make
blessed
short
work
of
*NL*
you
!
''
says
the
constable
,
giving
him
a
passionless
shake
.
``
My
*NL*
instructions
are
that
you
are
to
move
on

I
have
told
you
so
five
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where

''
cries
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Really
,
constable
,
you
know

''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
wistfully
,
and
*NL*
coughing
behind
his
hand
his
cough
of
great
perplexity
and
doubt
,
*NL*
``
really

that
does
seem
a
question

Where

you
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

replies
the
constable
.
``
My
*NL*
instructions

''
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
hear
,
Jo
?
It
is
nothing
to
you
or
to
any
one
else
that
the
*NL*
great
lights
of
the
parliamentary
sky
have
failed
for
some
few
years
*NL*
in
this
business
to
set
you
the
example
of
moving
on
.
The
one
grand
*NL*
recipe
remains
for
you
--
the
profound
philosophical
prescription
--
the
*NL*
be-all
and
the
end-all
of
your
strange
existence
upon
earth
.
Move
on
!
*NL*
You
are
by
no
means
to
move
off
,
Jo
,
for
the
great
lights
ca
n't
at
*NL*
all
agree
about
that

Move
on

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
says
nothing
to
this
effect
,
says
nothing
at
all
indeed
,
*NL*
but
coughs
his
forlornest
cough
,
expressive
of
no
thoroughfare
in
any
*NL*
direction
.
By
this
time
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Chadband
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
*NL*
hearing
the
altercation
,
have
appeared
upon
the
stairs

Guster
having
*NL*
never
left
the
end
of
the
passage
,
the
whole
household
are
assembled

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
simple
question

says
the
constable

*NL*
Mrs.

from

cries

To

the

law-stationer
relates
his

woeful
experience

suppressing

the
half-crown

*NL*
``
Well

says
the

so

he
said

Enter
Mr.
Guppy

who
nods
to
Mr.
Snagsby
and
touches
his
hat
with
the
*NL*
chivalry
of
clerkship
to
the
ladies
on
the
stairs

*NL*
*NL*
``

With
this
farewell
hint
and
pointing
generally
to
the
setting
sun
as
*NL*
a
likely
place
to
move
on
to
,
the
constable
bids
his
auditors
good
*NL*
afternoon
and
makes
the
echoes
of
Cook
's
Court
perform
slow
music
for
*NL*
him
as
he
walks
away
on
the
shady
side
,
carrying
his
iron-bound
hat
*NL*
in
his
hand
for
a
little
ventilation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Jo
's
improbable
story
concerning
the
lady
and
the
sovereign
has
*NL*
awakened
more
or
less
the
curiosity
of
all
the
company
.
Mr.
Guppy
,
*NL*
who
has
an
inquiring
mind
in
matters
of
evidence
and
who
has
*NL*
been
suffering
severely
from
the
lassitude
of
the
long
vacation
,
*NL*
takes
that
interest
in
the
case
that
he
enters
on
a
regular
*NL*
cross-examination
of
the
witness
,
which
is
found
so
interesting
by
*NL*
the
ladies
that
Mrs.
Snagsby
politely
invites
him
to
step
upstairs
*NL*
and
drink
a
cup
of
tea
,
if
he
will
excuse
the
disarranged
state
of
*NL*
the
tea-table
,
consequent
on
their
previous
exertions
.
Mr.
Guppy
*NL*
yielding
his
assent
to
this
proposal
,
Jo
is
requested
to
follow
into
*NL*
the
drawing-room
doorway
,
where
Mr.
Guppy
takes
him
in
hand
as
a
*NL*
witness
,
patting
him
into
this
shape
,
that
shape
,
and
the
other
shape
*NL*
like
a
butterman
dealing
with
so
much
butter
,
and
worrying
him
*NL*
according
to
the
best
models
.
Nor
is
the
examination
unlike
many
such
*NL*
model
displays
,
both
in
respect
of
its
eliciting
nothing
and
of
its
*NL*
being
lengthy
,
for
Mr.
Guppy
is
sensible
of
his
talent
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
feels
not
only
that
it
gratifies
her
inquisitive
disposition
,
*NL*
but
that
it
lifts
her
husband
's
establishment
higher
up
in
the
law
.
*NL*
During
the
progress
of
this
keen
encounter
,
the
vessel
Chadband
,
*NL*
being
merely
engaged
in
the
oil
trade
,
gets
aground
and
waits
to
be
*NL*
floated
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
Either
this
boy
sticks
to
it
like
*NL*
cobbler

wax

there
is
something
out
of

common
here
that
beats
*NL*
anything
that
ever
came
into
my
way

Kenge

Carboy

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

whispers
Mrs.

exclaims

on
forensic
principles

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mrs.

humouring
the
joke

with
a
hard-favoured

Mr.

Mr.

throwing
on

admiring

is
thrown
on

Mr.

at

rises

smoking

At

Jo

who
seems
to
have
*NL*
been
gradually
going
out
of
his
mind
,
smears
his
right
arm
over
his
*NL*
face
and
gives
a
terrible
yawn

Mrs.

indignantly
expresses

her
belief

a
limb
of
the
arch-fiend

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

persecuted
chin
folding
*NL*
itself
into

fat
smile
again

looks
round

Great

*NL*
``

looking

-LRB-

cow-like
lightness

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
,
whose
immediate
object
seems
to
be
to
get
away
on
any
terms
,
*NL*
gives
a
shuffling
nod
.
Mr.
Guppy
then
throws
him
a
penny
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
calls
to
Guster
to
see
him
safely
out
of
the
house
.
But
*NL*
before
he
goes
downstairs
,
Mr.
Snagsby
loads
him
with
some
broken
*NL*
meats
from
the
table
,
which
he
carries
away
,
hugging
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Mr.
Chadband
--
of
whom
the
persecutors
say
that
it
is
no
wonder
he
*NL*
should
go
on
for
any
length
of
time
uttering
such
abominable
*NL*
nonsense
,
but
that
the
wonder
rather
is
that
he
should
ever
leave
*NL*
off
,
having
once
the
audacity
to
begin
--
retires
into
private
life
*NL*
until
he
invests
a
little
capital
of
supper
in
the
oil-trade
.
Jo
*NL*
moves
on
,
through
the
long
vacation
,
down
to
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
*NL*
where
he
finds
a
baking
stony
corner
wherein
to
settle
to
his
repast
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
he
sits
,
munching
and
gnawing
,
and
looking
up
at
the
great
*NL*
cross
on
the
summit
of
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
glittering
above
a
*NL*
red-and-violet-tinted
cloud
of
smoke
.
From
the
boy
's
face
one
might
*NL*
suppose
that
sacred
emblem
to
be
,
in
his
eyes
,
the
crowning
confusion
*NL*
of
the
great
,
confused
city
--
so
golden
,
so
high
up
,
so
far
out
of
his
*NL*
reach
.
There
he
sits
,
the
sun
going
down
,
the
river
running
fast
,
the
*NL*
crowd
flowing
by
him
in
two
streams
--
everything
moving
on
to
some
*NL*
purpose
and
to
one
end
--
until
he
is
stirred
up
and
told
to
``
move
on
''
*NL*
too

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
A
New
Lodger
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
vacation
saunters
on
towards
term-time
like
an
idle
river
*NL*
very
leisurely
strolling
down
a
flat
country
to
the
sea
.
Mr.
Guppy
*NL*
saunters
along
with
it
congenially
.
He
has
blunted
the
blade
of
his
*NL*
penknife
and
broken
the
point
off
by
sticking
that
instrument
into
*NL*
his
desk
in
every
direction
.
Not
that
he
bears
the
desk
any
ill
will
,
*NL*
but
he
must
do
something
,
and
it
must
be
something
of
an
unexciting
*NL*
nature
,
which
will
lay
neither
his
physical
nor
his
intellectual
*NL*
energies
under
too
heavy
contribution
.
He
finds
that
nothing
agrees
*NL*
with
him
so
well
as
to
make
little
gyrations
on
one
leg
of
his
stool
,
*NL*
and
stab
his
desk
,
and
gape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kenge
and
Carboy
are
out
of
town
,
and
the
articled
clerk
has
taken
*NL*
out
a
shooting
license
and
gone
down
to
his
father
's
,
and
Mr.
Guppy
's
*NL*
two
fellow-stipendiaries
are
away
on
leave
.
Mr.
Guppy
and
Mr.
Richard
*NL*
Carstone
divide
the
dignity
of
the
office
.
But
Mr.
Carstone
is
for
*NL*
the
time
being
established
in
Kenge
's
room
,
whereat
Mr.
Guppy
chafes
.
*NL*
So
exceedingly
that
he
with
biting
sarcasm
informs
his
mother
,
in
the
*NL*
confidential
moments
when
he
sups
with
her
off
a
lobster
and
lettuce
*NL*
in
the
Old
Street
Road
,
that
he
is
afraid
the
office
is
hardly
good
*NL*
enough
for
swells
,
and
that
if
he
had
known
there
was
a
swell
coming
,
*NL*
he
would
have
got
it
painted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
suspects
everybody
who
enters
on
the
occupation
of
a
stool
*NL*
in
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
office
of
entertaining
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
*NL*
sinister
designs
upon
him
.
He
is
clear
that
every
such
person
wants
*NL*
to
depose
him
.
If
he
be
ever
asked
how
,
why
,
when
,
or
wherefore
,
he
*NL*
shuts
up
one
eye
and
shakes
his
head
.
On
the
strength
of
these
*NL*
profound
views
,
he
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
takes
infinite
pains
*NL*
to
counterplot
when
there
is
no
plot
,
and
plays
the
deepest
games
of
*NL*
chess
without
any
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
source
of
much
gratification
to
Mr.
Guppy
,
therefore
,
to
find
*NL*
the
new-comer
constantly
poring
over
the
papers
in
Jarndyce
and
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
for
he
well
knows
that
nothing
but
confusion
and
failure
*NL*
can
come
of
that
.
His
satisfaction
communicates
itself
to
a
third
*NL*
saunterer
through
the
long
vacation
in
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
office
,
to
*NL*
wit
,
Young
Smallweed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Young
Smallweed
-LRB-
metaphorically
called
Small
and
eke
Chick
*NL*
Weed
,
as
it
were
jocularly
to
express
a
fledgling
-RRB-
was
ever
a
boy
is
*NL*
much
doubted
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
He
is
now
something
under
fifteen
and
*NL*
an
old
limb
of
the
law
.
He
is
facetiously
understood
to
entertain
a
*NL*
passion
for
a
lady
at
a
cigar-shop
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Chancery
*NL*
Lane
and
for
her
sake
to
have
broken
off
a
contract
with
another
*NL*
lady
,
to
whom
he
had
been
engaged
some
years
.
He
is
a
town-made
*NL*
article
,
of
small
stature
and
weazen
features
,
but
may
be
perceived
*NL*
from
a
considerable
distance
by
means
of
his
very
tall
hat
.
To
become
*NL*
a
Guppy
is
the
object
of
his
ambition
.
He
dresses
at
that
gentleman
*NL*
-LRB-
by
whom
he
is
patronized
-RRB-
,
talks
at
him
,
walks
at
him
,
founds
*NL*
himself
entirely
on
him
.
He
is
honoured
with
Mr.
Guppy
's
particular
*NL*
confidence
and
occasionally
advises
him
,
from
the
deep
wells
of
his
*NL*
experience
,
on
difficult
points
in
private
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
has
been
lolling
out
of
window
all
the
morning
after
trying
*NL*
all
the
stools
in
succession
and
finding
none
of
them
easy
,
and
after
*NL*
several
times
putting
his
head
into
the
iron
safe
with
a
notion
of
*NL*
cooling
it
.
Mr.
Smallweed
has
been
twice
dispatched
for
effervescent
*NL*
drinks
,
and
has
twice
mixed
them
in
the
two
official
tumblers
and
*NL*
stirred
them
up
with
the
ruler
.
Mr.
Guppy
propounds
for
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
's
consideration
the
paradox
that
the
more
you
drink
the
*NL*
thirstier
you
are
and
reclines
his
head
upon
the
window-sill
in
a
*NL*
state
of
hopeless
languor
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
thus
looking
out
into
the
shade
of
Old
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
*NL*
surveying
the
intolerable
bricks
and
mortar
,
Mr.
Guppy
becomes
*NL*
conscious
of
a
manly
whisker
emerging
from
the
cloistered
walk
below
*NL*
and
turning
itself
up
in
the
direction
of
his
face
.
At
the
same
time
,
*NL*
a
low
whistle
is
wafted
through
the
Inn
and
a
suppressed
voice
cries
,
*NL*
``
Hip
!
Gup-py
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
it
!
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
aroused
.
``
Small
!
Here
's
*NL*
Jobling
!
''
Small
's
head
looks
out
of
window
too
and
nods
to
Jobling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
sprung
up
from
?
''
inquires
Mr.
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
market-gardens
down
by
Deptford
.
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any
*NL*
longer
.
I
must
enlist
.
I
say
!
I
wish
you
'd
lend
me
half
a
crown
.
Upon
*NL*
my
soul
,
I
'm
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jobling
looks
hungry
and
also
has
the
appearance
of
having
run
to
*NL*
seed
in
the
market-gardens
down
by
Deptford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
Just
throw
out
half
a
crown
if
you
have
got
one
to
spare
.
I
*NL*
want
to
get
some
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
?
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
throwing
out
the
*NL*
coin
,
which
Mr.
Jobling
catches
neatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
should
I
have
to
hold
out
?
''
says
Jobling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
half
an
hour
.
I
am
only
waiting
here
till
the
enemy
goes
,
*NL*
returns
Mr.
Guppy
,
butting
inward
with
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
one
.
Going
to
be
articled
.
Will
you
wait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
give
a
fellow
anything
to
read
in
the
meantime
?
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Jobling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smallweed
suggests
the
law
list
.
But
Mr.
Jobling
declares
with
much
*NL*
earnestness
that
he
``
ca
n't
stand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
the
paper
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
He
shall
bring
it
down
.
*NL*
But
you
had
better
not
be
seen
about
here
.
Sit
on
our
staircase
and
*NL*
read
.
It
's
a
quiet
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jobling
nods
intelligence
and
acquiescence
.
The
sagacious
Smallweed
*NL*
supplies
him
with
the
newspaper
and
occasionally
drops
his
eye
upon
*NL*
him
from
the
landing
as
a
precaution
against
his
becoming
disgusted
*NL*
with
waiting
and
making
an
untimely
departure
.
At
last
the
enemy
*NL*
retreats
,
and
then
Smallweed
fetches
Mr.
Jobling
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
are
you
?
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
shaking
hands
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
.
How
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
replying
that
he
is
not
much
to
boast
of
,
Mr.
Jobling
*NL*
ventures
on
the
question
,
``
How
is
SHE
?
''
This
Mr.
Guppy
resents
as
a
*NL*
liberty
,
retorting
,
``
Jobling
,
there
ARE
chords
in
the
human
mind
--
''
*NL*
Jobling
begs
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
subject
but
that
!
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
with
a
gloomy
enjoyment
of
his
*NL*
injury
.
``
For
there
ARE
chords
,
Jobling
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jobling
begs
pardon
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
short
colloquy
,
the
active
Smallweed
,
who
is
of
the
*NL*
dinner
party
,
has
written
in
legal
characters
on
a
slip
of
paper
,
*NL*
``
Return
immediately
.
''
This
notification
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
,
*NL*
he
inserts
in
the
letter-box
,
and
then
putting
on
the
tall
hat
at
the
*NL*
angle
of
inclination
at
which
Mr.
Guppy
wears
his
,
informs
his
patron
*NL*
that
they
may
now
make
themselves
scarce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
they
betake
themselves
to
a
neighbouring
dining-house
,
of
*NL*
the
class
known
among
its
frequenters
by
the
denomination
slap-bang
,
*NL*
where
the
waitress
,
a
bouncing
young
female
of
forty
,
is
supposed
to
*NL*
have
made
some
impression
on
the
susceptible
Smallweed
,
of
whom
it
*NL*
may
be
remarked
that
he
is
a
weird
changeling
to
whom
years
are
*NL*
nothing
.
He
stands
precociously
possessed
of
centuries
of
owlish
*NL*
wisdom
.
If
he
ever
lay
in
a
cradle
,
it
seems
as
if
he
must
have
lain
*NL*
there
in
a
tail-coat
.
He
has
an
old
,
old
eye
,
has
Smallweed
;
and
he
*NL*
drinks
and
smokes
in
a
monkeyish
way
;
and
his
neck
is
stiff
in
his
*NL*
collar
;
and
he
is
never
to
be
taken
in
;
and
he
knows
all
about
it
,
*NL*
whatever
it
is
.
In
short
,
in
his
bringing
up
he
has
been
so
nursed
by
*NL*
Law
and
Equity
that
he
has
become
a
kind
of
fossil
imp
,
to
account
*NL*
for
whose
terrestrial
existence
it
is
reported
at
the
public
offices
*NL*
that
his
father
was
John
Doe
and
his
mother
the
only
female
member
of
*NL*
the
Roe
family
,
also
that
his
first
long-clothes
were
made
from
a
*NL*
blue
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
the
dining-house
,
unaffected
by
the
seductive
show
in
the
window
*NL*
of
artificially
whitened
cauliflowers
and
poultry
,
verdant
baskets
of
*NL*
peas
,
coolly
blooming
cucumbers
,
and
joints
ready
for
the
spit
,
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
leads
the
way
.
They
know
him
there
and
defer
to
him
.
He
has
*NL*
his
favourite
box
,
he
bespeaks
all
the
papers
,
he
is
down
upon
bald
*NL*
patriarchs
,
who
keep
them
more
than
ten
minutes
afterwards
.
It
is
of
*NL*
no
use
trying
him
with
anything
less
than
a
full-sized
``
bread
''
or
*NL*
proposing
to
him
any
joint
in
cut
unless
it
is
in
the
very
best
cut
.
*NL*
In
the
matter
of
gravy
he
is
adamant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conscious
of
his
elfin
power
and
submitting
to
his
dread
experience
,
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
consults
him
in
the
choice
of
that
day
's
banquet
,
turning
*NL*
an
appealing
look
towards
him
as
the
waitress
repeats
the
catalogue
*NL*
of
viands
and
saying
``
What
do
YOU
take
,
Chick
?
''
Chick
,
out
of
the
*NL*
profundity
of
his
artfulness
,
preferring
``
veal
and
ham
and
French
*NL*
beans
--
and
do
n't
you
forget
the
stuffing
,
Polly
''
-LRB-
with
an
unearthly
*NL*
cock
of
his
venerable
eye
-RRB-
,
Mr.
Guppy
and
Mr.
Jobling
give
the
like
*NL*
order
.
Three
pint
pots
of
half-and-half
are
superadded
.
Quickly
the
*NL*
waitress
returns
bearing
what
is
apparently
a
model
of
the
Tower
of
*NL*
Babel
but
what
is
really
a
pile
of
plates
and
flat
tin
dish-covers
.
*NL*
Mr.
Smallweed
,
approving
of
what
is
set
before
him
,
conveys
*NL*
intelligent
benignity
into
his
ancient
eye
and
winks
upon
her
.
Then
,
*NL*
amid
a
constant
coming
in
,
and
going
out
,
and
running
about
,
and
a
*NL*
clatter
of
crockery
,
and
a
rumbling
up
and
down
of
the
machine
which
*NL*
brings
the
nice
cuts
from
the
kitchen
,
and
a
shrill
crying
for
more
*NL*
nice
cuts
down
the
speaking-pipe
,
and
a
shrill
reckoning
of
the
cost
*NL*
of
nice
cuts
that
have
been
disposed
of
,
and
a
general
flush
and
*NL*
steam
of
hot
joints
,
cut
and
uncut
,
and
a
considerably
heated
*NL*
atmosphere
in
which
the
soiled
knives
and
tablecloths
seem
to
break
*NL*
out
spontaneously
into
eruptions
of
grease
and
blotches
of
beer
,
the
*NL*
legal
triumvirate
appease
their
appetites
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jobling
is
buttoned
up
closer
than
mere
adornment
might
require
.
*NL*
His
hat
presents
at
the
rims
a
peculiar
appearance
of
a
glistening
*NL*
nature
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
favourite
snail-promenade
.
The
same
*NL*
phenomenon
is
visible
on
some
parts
of
his
coat
,
and
particularly
at
*NL*
the
seams
.
He
has
the
faded
appearance
of
a
gentleman
in
embarrassed
*NL*
circumstances
;
even
his
light
whiskers
droop
with
something
of
a
*NL*
shabby
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
appetite
is
so
vigorous
that
it
suggests
spare
living
for
some
*NL*
little
time
back
.
He
makes
such
a
speedy
end
of
his
plate
of
veal
and
*NL*
ham
,
bringing
it
to
a
close
while
his
companions
are
yet
midway
in
*NL*
theirs
,
that
Mr.
Guppy
proposes
another
.
``
Thank
you
,
Guppy
,
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Jobling
,
``
I
really
do
n't
know
but
what
I
WILL
take
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
being
brought
,
he
falls
to
with
great
goodwill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
takes
silent
notice
of
him
at
intervals
until
he
is
half
*NL*
way
through
this
second
plate
and
stops
to
take
an
enjoying
pull
at
*NL*
his
pint
pot
of
half-and-half
-LRB-
also
renewed
-RRB-
and
stretches
out
his
*NL*
legs
and
rubs
his
hands
.
Beholding
him
in
which
glow
of
contentment
,
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
says
,
``
You
are
a
man
again
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

quite
yet

Mr.

never
shall
it
be
said
,
''
Mr.
Guppy
adds
with
*NL*
emphasis
,
``
that
William
Guppy
turned
his
back
upon
his
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
the
proposal
is
so
directly
to
the
purpose
that
*NL*
Mr.
Jobling
says
with
emotion
,
``
Guppy
,
my
trump
,
your
fist
!
''
Mr.
*NL*
Guppy
presents
it
,
saying
,
``
Jobling
,
my
boy
,
there
it
is
!
''
Mr.
*NL*
Jobling
returns
,
``
Guppy
,
we
have
been
pals
now
for
some
years
!
''
Mr.
*NL*
Guppy
replies
,
``
Jobling
,
we
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
shake
hands
,
and
Mr.
Jobling
adds
in
a
feeling
manner
,
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Guppy
,
I
do
n't
know
but
what
I
WILL
take
another
glass
*NL*
for
old
acquaintance
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Krook
's
last
lodger
died
there
,
''
observes
Mr.
Guppy
in
an
incidental
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
though
!
''
says
Mr.
Jobling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
verdict
.
Accidental
death
.
You
do
n't
mind
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
Mr.
Jobling
,
``
I
do
n't
mind
it
;
but
he
might
as
well
have
*NL*
died
somewhere
else
.
It
's
devilish
odd
that
he
need
go
and
die
at
MY
*NL*
place
!
''
Mr.
Jobling
quite
resents
this
liberty
,
several
times
*NL*
returning
to
it
with
such
remarks
as
,
``
There
are
places
enough
to
die
*NL*
in
,
I
should
think
!
''
or
,
``
He
would
n't
have
liked
my
dying
at
HIS
*NL*
place
,
I
dare
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
compact
being
virtually
made
,
Mr.
Guppy
proposes
to
*NL*
dispatch
the
trusty
Smallweed
to
ascertain
if
Mr.
Krook
is
at
home
,
*NL*
as
in
that
case
they
may
complete
the
negotiation
without
delay
.
Mr.
*NL*
Jobling
approving
,
Smallweed
puts
himself
under
the
tall
hat
and
*NL*
conveys
it
out
of
the
dining-rooms
in
the
Guppy
manner
.
He
soon
*NL*
returns
with
the
intelligence
that
Mr.
Krook
is
at
home
and
that
he
*NL*
has
seen
him
through
the
shop-door
,
sitting
in
the
back
premises
,
*NL*
sleeping
``
like
one
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
pay
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
and
we
'll
go
and
see
him
.
Small
,
*NL*
what
will
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Smallweed
,
compelling
the
attendance
of
the
waitress
with
one
*NL*
hitch
of
his
eyelash
,
instantly
replies
as
follows
:
``
Four
veals

and

''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
at
all
excited
by
these
stupendous
calculations
,
Smallweed
*NL*
dismisses
his
friends
with
a
cool
nod
and
remains
behind
to
take
a
*NL*
little
admiring
notice
of
Polly
,
as
opportunity
may
serve
,
and
to
*NL*
read
the
daily
papers
,
which
are
so
very
large
in
proportion
to
*NL*
himself
,
shorn
of
his
hat
,
that
when
he
holds
up
the
Times
to
run
his
*NL*
eye
over
the
columns
,
he
seems
to
have
retired
for
the
night
and
to
*NL*
have
disappeared
under
the
bedclothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
and
Mr.
Jobling
repair
to
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
,
where
*NL*
they
find
Krook
still
sleeping
like
one
o'clock
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
breathing
stertorously
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
quite
*NL*
insensible
to
any
external
sounds
or
even
to
gentle
shaking
.
On
the
*NL*
table
beside
him
,
among
the
usual
lumber
,
stand
an
empty
gin-bottle
*NL*
and
a
glass
.
The
unwholesome
air
is
so
stained
with
this
liquor
that
*NL*
even
the
green
eyes
of
the
cat
upon
her
shelf
,
as
they
open
and
shut
*NL*
and
glimmer
on
the
visitors
,
look
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
up
here
!
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
giving
the
relaxed
figure
of
the
old
*NL*
man
another
shake
.
``
Mr.
Krook
!
Halloa
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
would
seem
as
easy
to
wake
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
with
a
*NL*
spirituous
heat
smouldering
in
it
.
``
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
stupor
as
*NL*
he
falls
into
,
between
drink
and
sleep
?
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
is
his
regular
sleep
,
''
returns
Jobling
,
rather
alarmed
,
*NL*
``
it
'll
last
a
long
time
one
of
these
days
,
I
am
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
always
more
like
a
fit
than
a
nap
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
shaking
him
*NL*
again
.
``
Halloa
,
your
lordship
!
Why
,
he
might
be
robbed
fifty
times
*NL*
over
!
Open
your
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
much
ado
,
he
opens
them
,
but
without
appearing
to
see
his
*NL*
visitors
or
any
other
objects
.
Though
he
crosses
one
leg
on
another
,
*NL*
and
folds
his
hands
,
and
several
times
closes
and
opens
his
parched
*NL*
lips
,
he
seems
to
all
intents
and
purposes
as
insensible
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
alive
,
at
any
rate
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
How
are
you
,
my
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
.
I
have
brought
a
friend
of
mine
,
sir
,
on
a
little
matter
*NL*
of
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
still
sits
,
often
smacking
his
dry
lips
without
the
least
*NL*
consciousness
.
After
some
minutes
he
makes
an
attempt
to
rise
.
They
*NL*
help
him
up
,
and
he
staggers
against
the
wall
and
stares
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Krook
?
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
in
some
discomfiture
.
``
How
*NL*
do
you
do
,
sir
?
You
are
looking
charming
,
Mr.
Krook
.
I
hope
you
are
*NL*
pretty
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
in
aiming
a
purposeless
blow
at
Mr.
Guppy
,
or
at
*NL*
nothing
,
feebly
swings
himself
round
and
comes
with
his
face
against
*NL*
the
wall
.
So
he
remains
for
a
minute
or
two
,
heaped
up
against
it
,
*NL*
and
then
staggers
down
the
shop
to
the
front
door
.
The
air
,
the
*NL*
movement
in
the
court
,
the
lapse
of
time
,
or
the
combination
of
these
*NL*
things
recovers
him
.
He
comes
back
pretty
steadily
,
adjusting
his
fur
*NL*
cap
on
his
head
and
looking
keenly
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
servant

gentlemen

I

dozing

Hi

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
so

responds
Mr.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
You
've
been
a-trying
to
do

says
the
suspicious
*NL*
Krook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
little
,
''
Mr.
Guppy
explains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
's
eye
resting
on
the
empty
bottle
,
he
takes
it
up
,
*NL*
examines
it
,
and
slowly
tilts
it
upside
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
''
he
cries
like
the
hobgoblin
in
the
story
.
``
Somebody
's
been
*NL*
making
free
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
we
found
it
so

says
Mr.

.
``
Would
you
allow
me
to
*NL*
get
it
filled
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

certainly
I
would

cries
Krook
in
high
glee
.
``
Certainly
I
*NL*
would

Do
n't
mention

Get
it
filled
next
door
--
Sol
's

the
*NL*
Lord
Chancellor
's
fourteenpenny

Bless
you
,

know

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
so
presses
the
empty
bottle
upon
Mr.
Guppy
that
that
gentleman
,
*NL*
with
a
nod
to
his
friend
,
accepts
the
trust
and
hurries
out
and
*NL*
hurries
in
again
with
the
bottle
filled
.
The
old
man
receives
it
in
*NL*
his
arms
like
a
beloved
grandchild
and
pats
it
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
I
say
,
''
he
whispers
,
with
his
eyes
screwed
up
,
after
tasting
*NL*
it
,
``
this
ai
n't
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
fourteenpenny
.
This
is
*NL*
eighteenpenny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
might
like
that
better
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
nobleman
,
sir
,
''
returns
Krook
with
another
taste
,
and
his
*NL*
hot
breath
seems
to
come
towards
them
like
a
flame
.
``
You
're
a
baron
*NL*
of
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
advantage
of
this
auspicious
moment
,
Mr.
Guppy
presents
his
*NL*
friend
under
the
impromptu
name
of
Mr.
Weevle
and
states
the
object
*NL*
of
their
visit
.
Krook
,
with
his
bottle
under
his
arm
-LRB-
he
never
gets
*NL*
beyond
a
certain
point
of
either
drunkenness
or
sobriety
-RRB-
,
takes
time
*NL*
to
survey
his
proposed
lodger
and
seems
to
approve
of
him
.
``
You
'd
*NL*
like
to
see
the
room
,
young
man
?
''
he
says
.
``
Ah
!
It
's
a
good
room
!
*NL*
Been
whitewashed
.
Been
cleaned
down
with
soft
soap
and
soda
.
Hi
!
It
's
*NL*
worth
twice
the
rent
,
letting
alone
my
company
when
you
want
it
and
*NL*
such
a
cat
to
keep
the
mice
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Commending
the
room
after
this
manner
,
the
old
man
takes
them
*NL*
upstairs
,
where
indeed
they
do
find
it
cleaner
than
it
used
to
be
and
*NL*
also
containing
some
old
articles
of
furniture
which
he
has
dug
up
*NL*
from
his
inexhaustible
stores
.
The
terms
are
easily
concluded
--
for
*NL*
the
Lord
Chancellor
can
not
be
hard
on
Mr.
Guppy
,
associated
as
he
is
*NL*
with
Kenge
and
Carboy
,
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
,
and
other
famous
claims
*NL*
on
his
professional
consideration
--
and
it
is
agreed
that
Mr.
Weevle
*NL*
shall
take
possession
on
the
morrow
.
Mr.
Weevle
and
Mr.
Guppy
then
*NL*
repair
to
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
,
where
the
personal
*NL*
introduction
of
the
former
to
Mr.
Snagsby
is
effected
and
-LRB-
more
*NL*
important
-RRB-
the
vote
and
interest
of
Mrs.
Snagsby
are
secured
.
They
*NL*
then
report
progress
to
the
eminent
Smallweed
,
waiting
at
the
office
*NL*
in
his
tall
hat
for
that
purpose
,
and
separate
,
Mr.
Guppy
explaining
*NL*
that
he
would
terminate
his
little
entertainment
by
standing
treat
at
*NL*
the
play
but
that
there
are
chords
in
the
human
mind
which
would
*NL*
render
it
a
hollow
mockery
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
in
the
dusk
of
evening
,
Mr.
Weevle
modestly
appears
at
*NL*
Krook
's
,
by
no
means
incommoded
with
luggage
,
and
establishes
himself
*NL*
in
his
new
lodging
,
where
the
two
eyes
in
the
shutters
stare
at
him
*NL*
in
his
sleep
,
as
if
they
were
full
of
wonder
.
On
the
following
day
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
,
who
is
a
handy
good-for-nothing
kind
of
young
fellow
,
*NL*
borrows
a
needle
and
thread
of
Miss
Flite
and
a
hammer
of
his
*NL*
landlord
and
goes
to
work
devising
apologies
for
window-curtains
,
and
*NL*
knocking
up
apologies
for
shelves
,
and
hanging
up
his
two
teacups
,
*NL*
milkpot
,
and
crockery
sundries
on
a
pennyworth
of
little
hooks
,
like
*NL*
a
shipwrecked
sailor
making
the
best
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
Mr.
Weevle
prizes
most
of
all
his
few
possessions
-LRB-
next
*NL*
after
his
light
whiskers
,
for
which
he
has
an
attachment
that
only
*NL*
whiskers
can
awaken
in
the
breast
of
man
-RRB-
is
a
choice
collection
of
*NL*
copper-plate
impressions
from
that
truly
national
work
The
Divinities
*NL*
of
Albion
,
or
Galaxy
Gallery
of
British
Beauty
,
representing
ladies
*NL*
of
title
and
fashion
in
every
variety
of
smirk
that
art
,
combined
*NL*
with
capital
,
is
capable
of
producing
.
With
these
magnificent
*NL*
portraits
,
unworthily
confined
in
a
band-box
during
his
seclusion
*NL*
among
the
market-gardens
,
he
decorates
his
apartment
;
and
as
the
*NL*
Galaxy
Gallery
of
British
Beauty
wears
every
variety
of
fancy
dress
,
*NL*
plays
every
variety
of
musical
instrument
,
fondles
every
variety
of
*NL*
dog
,
ogles
every
variety
of
prospect
,
and
is
backed
up
by
every
*NL*
variety
of
flower-pot
and
balustrade
,
the
result
is
very
imposing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
fashion
is
Mr.
Weevle
's
,
as
it
was
Tony
Jobling
's
,
weakness
.
To
*NL*
borrow
yesterday
's
paper
from
the
Sol
's
Arms
of
an
evening
and
read
*NL*
about
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
meteors
that
are
shooting
*NL*
across
the
fashionable
sky
in
every
direction
is
unspeakable
*NL*
consolation
to
him
.
To
know
what
member
of
what
brilliant
and
*NL*
distinguished
circle
accomplished
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
*NL*
feat
of
joining
it
yesterday
or
contemplates
the
no
less
brilliant
*NL*
and
distinguished
feat
of
leaving
it
to-morrow
gives
him
a
thrill
of
*NL*
joy
.
To
be
informed
what
the
Galaxy
Gallery
of
British
Beauty
is
*NL*
about
,
and
means
to
be
about
,
and
what
Galaxy
marriages
are
on
the
*NL*
tapis
,
and
what
Galaxy
rumours
are
in
circulation
,
is
to
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
most
glorious
destinies
of
mankind
.
Mr.
Weevle
*NL*
reverts
from
this
intelligence
to
the
Galaxy
portraits
implicated
,
*NL*
and
seems
to
know
the
originals
,
and
to
be
known
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
rest
he
is
a
quiet
lodger
,
full
of
handy
shifts
and
devices
*NL*
as
before
mentioned
,
able
to
cook
and
clean
for
himself
as
well
as
to
*NL*
carpenter
,
and
developing
social
inclinations
after
the
shades
of
*NL*
evening
have
fallen
on
the
court
.
At
those
times
,
when
he

not
*NL*
visited
by
Mr.
Guppy
or
by
a
small
light
in
his
likeness
quenched
in
*NL*
a
dark
hat
,
he
comes
out
of
his
dull
room
--
where
he
has
inherited
the
*NL*
deal
wilderness
of
desk
bespattered
with
a
rain
of
ink

talks
to

Krook

they
call
it
in
the
court

any

disposed
for
conversation

Wherefore
,
Mrs.
Piper
,
who
*NL*
leads
the
court
,
is
impelled
to
offer
two
remarks
to
Mrs.
Perkins
:
*NL*
firstly
,
that
if
her
Johnny
was
to
have
whiskers
,
she
could
wish
'em
*NL*
to
be
identically
like
that
young
man
's
;
and
secondly
,
``
Mark
my
*NL*
words
,
Mrs.
Perkins
,
ma'am
,
and
do
n't
you
be
surprised
,
Lord
bless
*NL*
you
,
if
that
young
man
comes
in
at
last
for
old
Krook
's
money

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Smallweed
Family
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
rather
ill-favoured
and
ill-savoured
neighbourhood
,
though
one
*NL*
of
its
rising
grounds
bears
the
name
of
Mount
Pleasant
,
the
Elfin
*NL*
Smallweed
,
christened
Bartholomew
and
known
on
the
domestic
hearth
as
*NL*
Bart
,
passes
that
limited
portion
of
his
time
on
which
the
office
and
*NL*
its
contingencies
have
no
claim
.
He
dwells
in
a
little
narrow
street
,
*NL*
always
solitary
,
shady
,
and
sad
,
closely
bricked
in
on
all
sides
like
*NL*
a
tomb
,
but
where
there
yet
lingers
the
stump
of
an
old
forest
tree
*NL*
whose
flavour
is
about
as
fresh
and
natural
as
the
Smallweed
smack
of
*NL*
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
has
been
only
one
child
in
the
Smallweed
family
for
several
*NL*
generations
.
Little
old
men
and
women
there
have
been
,
but
no
child
,
*NL*
until
Mr.
Smallweed
's
grandmother
,
now
living
,
became
weak
in
her
*NL*
intellect
and
fell
-LRB-
for
the
first
time
-RRB-
into
a
childish
state
.
With
*NL*
such
infantine
graces
as
a
total
want
of
observation
,
memory
,
*NL*
understanding
,
and
interest
,
and
an
eternal
disposition
to
fall
*NL*
asleep
over
the
fire
and
into
it
,
Mr.
Smallweed
's
grandmother
has
*NL*
undoubtedly
brightened
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Smallweed
's
grandfather
is
likewise
of
the
party
.
He
is
in
a
*NL*
helpless
condition
as
to
his
lower
,
and
nearly
so
as
to
his
upper
,
*NL*
limbs
,
but
his
mind
is
unimpaired
.
It
holds
,
as
well
as
it
ever
held
,
*NL*
the
first
four
rules
of
arithmetic
and
a
certain
small
collection
of
*NL*
the
hardest
facts
.
In
respect
of
ideality
,
reverence
,
wonder
,
and
*NL*
other
such
phrenological
attributes
,
it
is
no
worse
off
than
it
used
*NL*
to
be
.
Everything
that
Mr.
Smallweed
's
grandfather
ever
put
away
in
*NL*
his
mind
was
a
grub
at
first
,
and
is
a
grub
at
last
.
In
all
his
life
*NL*
he
has
never
bred
a
single
butterfly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
of
this
pleasant
grandfather
,
of
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
Mount
Pleasant
,
was
a
horny-skinned
,
two-legged
,
money-getting
*NL*
species
of
spider
who
spun
webs
to
catch
unwary
flies
and
retired
*NL*
into
holes
until
they
were
entrapped
.
The
name
of
this
old
pagan
's
*NL*
god
was
Compound
Interest
.
He
lived
for
it
,
married
it
,
died
of
it
.
*NL*
Meeting
with
a
heavy
loss
in
an
honest
little
enterprise
in
which
all
*NL*
the
loss
was
intended
to
have
been
on
the
other
side
,
he
broke
*NL*
something
--
something
necessary
to
his
existence
,
therefore
it
*NL*
could
n't
have
been
his
heart
--
and
made
an
end
of
his
career
.
As
his
*NL*
character
was
not
good
,
and
he
had
been
bred
at
a
charity
school
in
a
*NL*
complete
course
,
according
to
question
and
answer
,
of
those
ancient
*NL*
people
the
Amorites
and
Hittites
,
he
was
frequently
quoted
as
an
*NL*
example
of
the
failure
of
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
spirit
shone
through
his
son
,
to
whom
he
had
always
preached
of
*NL*
``
going
out
''
early
in
life
and
whom
he
made
a
clerk
in
a
sharp
*NL*
scrivener
's
office
at
twelve
years
old
.
There
the
young
gentleman
*NL*
improved
his
mind
,
which
was
of
a
lean
and
anxious
character
,
and
*NL*
developing
the
family
gifts
,
gradually
elevated
himself
into
the
*NL*
discounting
profession
.
Going
out
early
in
life
and
marrying
late
,
as
*NL*
his
father
had
done
before
him
,
he
too
begat
a
lean
and
*NL*
anxious-minded
son
,
who
in
his
turn
,
going
out
early
in
life
and
*NL*
marrying
late
,
became
the
father
of
Bartholomew
and
Judith
Smallweed
,
*NL*
twins
.
During
the
whole
time
consumed
in
the
slow
growth
of
this
*NL*
family
tree
,
the
house
of
Smallweed
,
always
early
to
go
out
and
late
*NL*
to
marry
,
has
strengthened
itself
in
its
practical
character
,
has
*NL*
discarded
all
amusements
,
discountenanced
all
story-books
,
*NL*
fairy-tales
,
fictions
,
and
fables
,
and
banished
all
levities
*NL*
whatsoever
.
Hence
the
gratifying
fact
that
it
has
had
no
child
born
*NL*
to
it
and
that
the
complete
little
men
and
women
whom
it
has
produced
*NL*
have
been
observed
to
bear
a
likeness
to
old
monkeys
with
something
*NL*
depressing
on
their
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
present
time
,
in
the
dark
little
parlour
certain
feet
below
*NL*
the
level
of
the
street
--
a
grim
,
hard
,
uncouth
parlour
,
only
*NL*
ornamented
with
the
coarsest
of
baize
table-covers
,
and
the
hardest
*NL*
of
sheet-iron
tea-trays
,
and
offering
in
its
decorative
character
no
*NL*
bad
allegorical
representation
of
Grandfather
Smallweed
's
*NL*
mind
--
seated
in
two
black
horsehair
porter
's
chairs
,
one
on
each
side
*NL*
of
the
fire-place
,
the
superannuated
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Smallweed
while
*NL*
away
the
rosy
hours
.
On
the
stove
are
a
couple
of
trivets
for
the
*NL*
pots
and
kettles
which
it
is
Grandfather
Smallweed
's
usual
occupation
*NL*
to
watch
,
and
projecting
from
the
chimney-piece
between
them
is
a
*NL*
sort
of
brass
gallows
for
roasting
,
which
he
also
superintends
when
*NL*
it
is
in
action
.
Under
the
venerable
Mr.
Smallweed
's
seat
and
guarded
*NL*
by
his
spindle
legs
is
a
drawer
in
his
chair
,
reported
to
contain
*NL*
property
to
a
fabulous
amount
.
Beside
him
is
a
spare
cushion
with
*NL*
which
he
is
always
provided
in
order
that
he
may
have
something
to
*NL*
throw
at
the
venerable
partner
of
his
respected
age
whenever
she
*NL*
makes
an
allusion
to
money
--
a
subject
on
which
he
is
particularly
*NL*
sensitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
's
Bart
?
''
Grandfather
Smallweed
inquires
of
Judy
,
Bart
's
*NL*
twin
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
a
n't
come
in
yet
,
''
says
Judy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
his
tea-time
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
mean
to
say
it
wants
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
minutes
.
''
-LRB-
Loud
on
the
part
of
Judy
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
!
''
says
Grandfather
Smallweed
.
``
Ten
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grandmother
Smallweed
,
who
has
been
mumbling
and
shaking
her
head
at
*NL*
the
trivets
,
hearing
figures
mentioned
,
connects
them
with
money
and
*NL*
screeches
like
a
horrible
old
parrot
without
any
plumage
,
``
Ten
*NL*
ten-pound
notes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grandfather
Smallweed
immediately
throws
the
cushion
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drat
you
,
be
quiet
!
''
says
the
good
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
this
act
of
jaculation
is
twofold
.
It
not
only
doubles
*NL*
up
Mrs.
Smallweed
's
head
against
the
side
of
her
porter
's
chair
and
*NL*
causes
her
to
present
,
when
extricated
by
her
granddaughter
,
a
highly
*NL*
unbecoming
state
of
cap
,
but
the
necessary
exertion
recoils
on
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
himself
,
whom
it
throws
back
into
HIS
porter
's
chair
like
a
*NL*
broken
puppet
.
The
excellent
old
gentleman
being
at
these
times
a
*NL*
mere
clothes-bag
with
a
black
skull-cap
on
the
top
of
it
,
does
not
*NL*
present
a
very
animated
appearance
until
he
has
undergone
the
two
*NL*
operations
at
the
hands
of
his
granddaughter
of
being
shaken
up
like
*NL*
a
great
bottle
and
poked
and
punched
like
a
great
bolster
.
Some
*NL*
indication
of
a
neck
being
developed
in
him
by
these
means
,
he
and
*NL*
the
sharer
of
his
life
's
evening
again
fronting
one
another
in
their
*NL*
two
porter
's
chairs
,
like
a
couple
of
sentinels
long
forgotten
on
*NL*
their
post
by
the
Black
Serjeant
,
Death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judy
the
twin
is
worthy
company
for
these
associates
.
She
is
so
*NL*
indubitably
sister
to
Mr.
Smallweed
the
younger
that
the
two
kneaded
*NL*
into
one
would
hardly
make
a
young
person
of
average
proportions
,
*NL*
while
she
so
happily
exemplifies
the
before-mentioned
family
likeness
*NL*
to
the
monkey
tribe
that
attired
in
a
spangled
robe
and
cap
she
might
*NL*
walk
about
the
table-land
on
the
top
of
a
barrel-organ
without
*NL*
exciting
much
remark
as
an
unusual
specimen
.
Under
existing
*NL*
circumstances
,
however
,
she
is
dressed
in
a
plain
,
spare
gown
of
*NL*
brown
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judy
never
owned
a
doll
,
never
heard
of
Cinderella
,
never
played
at
*NL*
any
game
.
She
once
or
twice
fell
into
children
's
company
when
she
was
*NL*
about
ten
years
old
,
but
the
children
could
n't
get
on
with
Judy
,
and
*NL*
Judy
could
n't
get
on
with
them
.
She
seemed
like
an
animal
of
another
*NL*
species
,
and
there
was
instinctive
repugnance
on
both
sides
.
It
is
*NL*
very
doubtful
whether
Judy
knows
how
to
laugh
.
She
has
so
rarely
seen
*NL*
the
thing
done
that
the
probabilities
are
strong
the
other
way
.
Of
*NL*
anything
like
a
youthful
laugh
,
she
certainly
can
have
no
conception
.
*NL*
If
she
were
to
try
one
,
she
would
find
her
teeth
in
her
way
,
*NL*
modelling
that
action
of
her
face
,
as
she
has
unconsciously
modelled
*NL*
all
its
other
expressions
,
on
her
pattern
of
sordid
age
.
Such
is
*NL*
Judy
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
her
twin
brother
could
n't
wind
up
a
top
for
his
life
.
He
knows
no
*NL*
more
of
Jack
the
Giant
Killer
or
of
Sinbad
the
Sailor
than
he
knows
*NL*
of
the
people
in
the
stars
.
He
could
as
soon
play
at
leap-frog
or
at
*NL*
cricket
as
change
into
a
cricket
or
a
frog
himself
.
But
he
is
so
much
*NL*
the
better
off
than
his
sister
that
on
his
narrow
world
of
fact
an
*NL*
opening
has
dawned
into
such
broader
regions
as
lie
within
the
ken
of
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
.
Hence
his
admiration
and
his
emulation
of
that
shining
*NL*
enchanter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judy
,
with
a
gong-like
clash
and
clatter
,
sets
one
of
the
sheet-iron
*NL*
tea-trays
on
the
table
and
arranges
cups
and
saucers
.
The
bread
she
*NL*
puts
on
in
an
iron
basket
,
and
the
butter
-LRB-
and
not
much
of
it
-RRB-
in
a
*NL*
small
pewter
plate
.
Grandfather
Smallweed
looks
hard
after
the
tea
as
*NL*
it
is
served
out
and
asks
Judy
where
the
girl
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
do
you
mean
?
''
says
Judy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
from
Grandfather
Smallweed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
touches
a
spring
in
Grandmother
Smallweed
,
who
,
chuckling
as
*NL*
usual
at
the
trivets
,
cries
,
``
Over
the
water
!
Charley
over
the
water
,
*NL*
Charley
over
the
water
,
over
the
water
to
Charley
,
Charley
over
the
*NL*
water
,
over
the
water
to
Charley
!
''
and
becomes
quite
energetic
about
*NL*
it
.
Grandfather
looks
at
the
cushion
but
has
not
sufficiently
*NL*
recovered
his
late
exertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
he
says
when
there
is
silence
.
``
If
that
's
her
name
.
She
eats
a
*NL*
deal
.
It
would
be
better
to
allow
her
for
her
keep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Judy
,
with
her
brother
's
wink
,
shakes
her
head
and
purses
up
her
*NL*
mouth
into
no
without
saying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
returns
the
old
man
.
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
want
sixpence
a
day
,
and
we
can
do
it
for
less
,
''
says
Judy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Judy
answers
with
a
nod
of
deepest
meaning
and
calls
,
as
she
scrapes
*NL*
the
butter
on
the
loaf
with
every
precaution
against
waste
and
cuts
*NL*
it
into
slices
,
``
You
,
Charley
,
where
are
you
?
''
Timidly
obedient
to
*NL*
the
summons
,
a
little
girl
in
a
rough
apron
and
a
large
bonnet
,
with
*NL*
her
hands
covered
with
soap
and
water
and
a
scrubbing
brush
in
one
of
*NL*
them
,
appears
,
and
curtsys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
work
are
you
about
now
?
''
says
Judy
,
making
an
ancient
snap
at
*NL*
her
like
a
very
sharp
old
beldame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a-cleaning
the
upstairs
back
room
,
miss
,
''
replies
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
do
it
thoroughly
,
and
do
n't
loiter
.
Shirking
wo
n't
do
for
*NL*
me
.
Make
haste
!
Go
along
!
''
cries
Judy
with
a
stamp
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
``
You
girls
are
more
trouble
than
you
're
worth
,
by
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
severe
matron
,
as
she
returns
to
her
task
of
scraping
the
*NL*
butter
and
cutting
the
bread
,
falls
the
shadow
of
her
brother
,
*NL*
looking
in
at
the
window
.
For
whom
,
knife
and
loaf
in
hand
,
she
opens
*NL*
the
street-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
Bart
!
''
says
Grandfather
Smallweed

``
Here
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am

says
Bart

*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
along

your

*NL*
*NL*
Small
nods

*NL*
*NL*
Small
nods
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
.
Live
at
his
expense
as
much
as
you
can
,
and
take
*NL*
warning
by
his
foolish
example
.
That
's
the
use
of
such
a
friend
.
The
*NL*
only
use
you
can
put
him
to
,
''
says
the
venerable
sage
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
grandson
,
without
receiving
this
good
counsel
as
dutifully
as
he
*NL*
might
,
honours
it
with
all
such
acceptance
as
may
lie
in
a
slight
*NL*
wink
and
a
nod
and
takes
a
chair
at
the
tea-table
.
The
four
old
faces
*NL*
then
hover
over
teacups
like
a
company
of
ghastly
cherubim
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Smallweed
perpetually
twitching
her
head
and
chattering
at
the
*NL*
trivets
and
Mr.
Smallweed
requiring
to
be
repeatedly
shaken
up
like
a
*NL*
large
black
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
says
the
good
old
gentleman
,
reverting
to
his
lesson
of
*NL*
wisdom
.
``
That
's
such
advice
as
your
father
would
have
given
you
,
*NL*
Bart
.
You
never
saw
your
father
.
More
's
the
pity
.
He
was
my
true
*NL*
son
.
''
Whether
it
is
intended
to
be
conveyed
that
he
was
particularly
*NL*
pleasant
to
look
at
,
on
that
account
,
does
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
my
true
son
,
''
repeats
the
old
gentleman
,
folding
his
bread
*NL*
and
butter
on
his
knee
,
``
a
good
accountant
,
and
died
fifteen
years
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Smallweed
,
following
her
usual
instinct
,
breaks
out
with
*NL*
``
Fifteen
hundred
pound
.
Fifteen
hundred
pound
in
a
black
box
,
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
pound
locked
up
,
fifteen
hundred
pound
put
away
and
hid
!
''
Her
*NL*
worthy
husband
,
setting
aside
his
bread
and
butter
,
immediately
*NL*
discharges
the
cushion
at
her
,
crushes
her
against
the
side
of
her
*NL*
chair
,
and
falls
back
in
his
own
,
overpowered
.
His
appearance
,
after
*NL*
visiting
Mrs.
Smallweed
with
one
of
these
admonitions
,
is
*NL*
particularly
impressive
and
not
wholly
prepossessing
,
firstly
because
*NL*
the
exertion
generally
twists
his
black
skull-cap
over
one
eye
and
*NL*
gives
him
an
air
of
goblin
rakishness
,
secondly
because
he
mutters
*NL*
violent
imprecations
against
Mrs.
Smallweed
,
and
thirdly
because
the
*NL*
contrast
between
those
powerful
expressions
and
his
powerless
figure
*NL*
is
suggestive
of
a
baleful
old
malignant
who
would
be
very
wicked
if
*NL*
he
could
.
All
this
,
however
,
is
so
common
in
the
Smallweed
family
*NL*
circle
that
it
produces
no
impression
.
The
old
gentleman
is
merely
*NL*
shaken
and
has
his
internal
feathers
beaten
up
,
the
cushion
is
*NL*
restored
to
its
usual
place
beside
him
,
and
the
old
lady
,
perhaps
*NL*
with
her
cap
adjusted
and
perhaps
not
,
is
planted
in
her
chair
again
,
*NL*
ready
to
be
bowled
down
like
a
ninepin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
elapses
in
the
present
instance
before
the
old
gentleman
is
*NL*
sufficiently
cool
to
resume
his
discourse
,
and
even
then
he
mixes
it
*NL*
up
with
several
edifying
expletives
addressed
to
the
unconscious
*NL*
partner
of
his
bosom
,
who
holds
communication
with
nothing
on
earth
*NL*
but
the
trivets
.
As
thus
:
``
If
your
father
,
Bart
,
had
lived
longer
,
he
*NL*
might
have
been
worth
a
deal
of
money
--
you
brimstone
chatterer
!
--
but
*NL*
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
build
up
the
house
that
he
had
been
*NL*
making
the
foundations
for
,
through
many
a
year
--
you
jade
of
a
*NL*
magpie
,
jackdaw
,
and
poll-parrot
,
what
do
you
mean
!
--
he
took
ill
and
*NL*
died
of
a
low
fever
,
always
being
a
sparing
and
a
spare
man
,
full
of
*NL*
business
care
--
I
should
like
to
throw
a
cat
at
you
instead
of
a
*NL*
cushion
,
and
I
will
too
if
you
make
such
a
confounded
fool
of
*NL*
yourself
!
--
and
your
mother
,
who
was
a
prudent
woman
as
dry
as
a
chip
,
*NL*
just
dwindled
away
like
touchwood
after
you
and
Judy
were
born
--
you
*NL*
are
an
old
pig
.
You
are
a
brimstone
pig

You
're
a
head
of
swine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Judy
,
not
interested
in
what
she
has
often
heard
,
begins
to
collect
*NL*
in
a
basin
various
tributary
streams
of
tea
,
from
the
bottoms
of
cups
*NL*
and
saucers
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
tea-pot
for
the
little
*NL*
charwoman
's
evening
meal
.
In
like
manner
she
gets
together
,
in
the
*NL*
iron
bread-basket
,
as
many
outside
fragments
and
worn-down
heels
of
*NL*
loaves
as
the
rigid
economy
of
the
house
has
left
in
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
father
and
me
were
partners
,
Bart
,
''
says
the
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
``
and
when
I
am
gone
,
you
and
Judy
will
have
all
there
is
.
It
's
rare
*NL*
for
you
both
that
you
went
out
early
in
life
--
Judy
to
the
flower
*NL*
business
,
and
you
to
the
law
.
You
wo
n't
want
to
spend
it

You
'll
get
*NL*
your
living
without
it
,
and
put
more
to
it

When
I
am
gone
,
Judy
will
*NL*
go
back
to
the
flower
business
and
you
'll
still
stick
to
the
law

''
*NL*
*NL*
One
might
infer
from
Judy
's
appearance
that
her
business
rather
lay
*NL*
with
the
thorns
than
the
flowers
,
but
she
has
in
her
time
been
*NL*
apprenticed
to
the
art
and
mystery
of
artificial
flower-making
.
A
*NL*
close
observer
might
perhaps
detect
both
in
her
eye
and
her
*NL*
brother
's
,
when
their
venerable
grandsire
anticipates
his
being
gone
,
*NL*
some
little
impatience
to
know
when
he
may
be
going
,
and
some
*NL*
resentful
opinion
that
it
is
time
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
if
everybody
has
done
,
''
says
Judy
,
completing
her
preparations
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
that
girl
in
to
her
tea
.
She
would
never
leave
off
if
she
*NL*
took
it
by
herself
in
the
kitchen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
is
accordingly
introduced
,
and
under
a
heavy
fire
of
eyes
,
*NL*
sits
down
to
her
basin
and
a
Druidical
ruin
of
bread
and
butter
.
In
*NL*
the
active
superintendence
of
this
young
person
,
Judy
Smallweed
*NL*
appears
to
attain
a
perfectly
geological
age
and
to
date
from
the
*NL*
remotest
periods
.
Her
systematic
manner
of
flying
at
her
and
pouncing
*NL*
on
her
,
with
or
without
pretence
,
whether
or
no
,
is
wonderful
,
*NL*
evincing
an
accomplishment
in
the
art
of
girl-driving
seldom
reached
*NL*
by
the
oldest
practitioners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
stare
about
you
all
the
afternoon
,
''
cries
Judy
,
shaking
*NL*
her
head
and
stamping
her
foot
as
she
happens
to
catch
the
glance
*NL*
which
has
been
previously
sounding
the
basin
of
tea
,
``
but
take
your
*NL*
victuals
and
get
back
to
your
work

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
,
''
says
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
yes
,
''
returns
Miss
Smallweed
,
``
for
I
know
what
you
girls
*NL*
are

Do
it
without
saying
it
,
and
then
I
may

believe
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
swallows
a
great
gulp
of
tea
in
token
of
submission
and
so
*NL*
disperses
the
Druidical
ruins
that
Miss
Smallweed
charges
her
not
to
*NL*
gormandize
,
which
``
in
you
girls
,
''
she
observes
,
is
disgusting
.
*NL*
Charley
might
find
some
more
difficulty
in
meeting
her
views
on
the
*NL*
general
subject
of
girls
but
for
a
knock
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
who
it
is
,
and
do
n't
chew
when
you
open
it

''
cries
Judy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
object
of
her
attentions
withdrawing
for
the
purpose
,
Miss
*NL*
Smallweed
takes
that
opportunity
of
jumbling
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
bread
and
butter
together
and
launching
two
or
three
dirty
tea-cups
*NL*
into
the
ebb-tide
of
the
basin
of
tea
as
a
hint
that
she
considers
*NL*
the
eating
and
drinking
terminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
Who
is
it
,
and
what
's
wanted
?
''
says
the
snappish
Judy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
one
Mr.
George
,
it
appears
.
Without
other
announcement
or
*NL*
ceremony
,
Mr.
George
walks
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whew
!
''
says
Mr.
George
.
``
You
are
hot
here

Always
a

Well
!
*NL*
Perhaps
you
do
right
to

used
to
one

Mr.
George
makes
the
latter
*NL*
remark
to
himself
as
he
nods
to
Grandfather
Smallweed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho

cries
the
old
gentleman
.
``
How

How

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Middling

''
replies
Mr.
George
,
taking
a
chair
.
``
Your
granddaughter
I
*NL*
have
had
the
honour
of
seeing
before

*NL*

``
My

very
like

*NL*
sister

He
is
devilish
like
his
sister

''
says
Mr.
George
,
laying
a
*NL*
great
and
not
altogether
complimentary
stress
on
his
last
adjective
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
the
world
use
you
,
Mr.
George
?
''
Grandfather
Smallweed
*NL*
inquires
,
slowly
rubbing
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
much
as
usual
.
Like
a
football
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
a
swarthy
brown
man
of
fifty
,
well
made
,
and
good
looking
,
with
*NL*
crisp
dark
hair
,
bright
eyes
,
and
a
broad
chest
.
His
sinewy
and
*NL*
powerful
hands
,
as
sunburnt
as
his
face
,
have
evidently
been
used
to
*NL*
a
pretty
rough
life
.
What
is
curious
about
him
is
that
he
sits
*NL*
forward
on
his
chair
as
if
he
were
,
from
long
habit
,
allowing
space
*NL*
for
some
dress
or
accoutrements
that
he
has
altogether
laid
aside
.
*NL*
His
step
too
is
measured
and
heavy
and
would
go
well
with
a
weighty
*NL*
clash
and
jingle
of
spurs
.
He
is
close-shaved
now
,
but
his
mouth
is
*NL*
set
as
if
his
upper
lip
had
been
for
years
familiar
with
a
great
*NL*
moustache
;
and
his
manner
of
occasionally
laying
the
open
palm
of
his
*NL*
broad
brown
hand
upon
it
is
to
the
same
effect
.
Altogether
one
might
*NL*
guess
Mr.
George
to
have
been
a
trooper
once
upon
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
special
contrast
Mr.
George
makes
to
the
Smallweed
family
.
Trooper
*NL*
was
never
yet
billeted
upon
a
household
more
unlike
him
.
It
is
a
*NL*
broadsword
to
an
oyster-knife
.
His
developed
figure
and
their
stunted
*NL*
forms
,
his
large
manner
filling
any
amount
of
room
and
their
little
*NL*
narrow
pinched
ways
,
his
sounding
voice
and
their
sharp
spare
tones
,
*NL*
are
in
the
strongest
and
the
strangest
opposition
.
As
he
sits
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
grim
parlour
,
leaning
a
little
forward
,
with
his
hands
*NL*
upon
his
thighs
and
his
elbows
squared
,
he
looks
as
though
,
if
he
*NL*
remained
there
long
,
he
would
absorb
into
himself
the
whole
family
*NL*
and
the
whole
four-roomed
house
,
extra
little
back-kitchen
and
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
rub
your
legs
to
rub
life
into
'em
?
''
he
asks
of
Grandfather
*NL*
Smallweed
after
looking
round
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
partly
a
habit
,
Mr.
George
,
and
--
yes

it
partly
helps
the
*NL*
circulation
,
''
he
replies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cir-cu-la-tion
!
''
repeats
Mr.
George
,
folding
his
arms
upon
his
*NL*
chest
and
seeming
to
become
two
sizes
larger
.
``
Not
much
of

I
*NL*
should
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
I
'm
old

Grandfather
Smallweed

``
But
I
can

carry
my
years

nodding
at
his
wife
,
``
and
see
*NL*
what
she
is
?
You
're
a
brimstone
chatterer

with
a
sudden
revival
of
*NL*
his
late
hostility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unlucky
old
soul
!
''
says
Mr.
George
,
turning
his
head
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
``
Do
n't
scold
the
old
lady

Look
at

here

with

poor

cap
half
off

head

her
poor
hair
all
in

muddle

Hold
up

That
's
better

There
we
are

Think
of

mother

Smallweed

Mr.
George

coming
back
to
his
seat
from
assisting
*NL*
her
,
``

your

a
n't
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
were
an
excellent
son

Mr.
George

the
old
man
hints
*NL*
with
a
leer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
of
Mr.
George
's
face
rather
deepens
as
he
replies
,
``
Why
*NL*
no
.
I
was
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
astonished

been
one

But
I
was

I
was
a
thundering
bad
son

that

the

long

*NL*
*NL*
``
Surprising

cries
the

man

*NL*
*NL*
``
However

Mr.

resumes

by

to
two

leathern

out
of

in

he
secures
the

from

up

upright

shake

Resisting
the
temptation

agitating
him
violently

enough

make

roll
like

he
puts

subsides

smoking

consoling
itself

*NL*
``
How
do
you

Some

Besides
,
he
had
taken

He
owed
us

immense
sums
all
round

I

sooner
have
strangled
him

the

holding

up
his
impotent
ten
fingers
,
``
I
want
to

him
now

And
in
a
*NL*
sudden
access
of
fury
,
he
throws
the
cushion
at
the
unoffending
Mrs.
*NL*
Smallweed
,
but
it
passes
harmlessly
on
one
side
of
her
chair

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

returns
the
trooper
,
taking
his
pipe
from
*NL*
his
lips
for
a
moment
and
carrying
his
eyes
back
from
following
the
*NL*
progress
of
the
cushion
to
the
pipe-bowl
which
is
burning
low
,
``
that
*NL*
he
carried
on
heavily

went
to

I
have
been
at

many
a
day
when
he
was
charging
upon

full-gallop

I
was
with
him
*NL*
when
he
was
sick
and
well
,
rich
and
poor

I
laid
this
hand
upon
him

after

had
run
through

broken
down
everything

held
a
pistol
to
his
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
he
had
let
it
off

says
the
benevolent

coolly

*NL*
``

no

It

more

ashes
out

he
adds
*NL*
after
breaking
off
to
whistle
one
,
accompanied
on
the
table
with
the
*NL*
empty
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the

No

We

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

the
old
man
gives
him
both
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
think
your

the
city

says
the
trooper
,
looking
down
upon
him
like
a
giant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
I
am
afraid

returns
the
old
man
,
looking
*NL*
up
at
him
like
a
pygmy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
laughs
,
and
with
a
glance
at
Mr.
Smallweed
and
a
parting
*NL*
salutation
to
the
scornful
Judy
,
strides
out
of
the
parlour
,
clashing
*NL*
imaginary
sabres
and
other
metallic
appurtenances
as
he
goes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
damned
rogue

''
says
the
old
gentleman
,
making
a
hideous
*NL*
grimace
at
the
door
as
he
shuts
it
.
``
But
I
'll
lime
you
,
you
dog
,
I
'll
*NL*
lime
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
amiable
remark
,
his
spirit
soars
into
those
enchanting
*NL*
regions
of
reflection
which
its
education
and
pursuits
have
opened
to
*NL*
it
,
and
again
he
and
Mrs.
Smallweed
while
away
the
rosy
hours
,
two
*NL*
unrelieved
sentinels
forgotten
as
aforesaid
by
the
Black
Serjeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
twain
are
faithful
to
their
post
,
Mr.
George
strides
*NL*
through
the
streets
with
a
massive
kind
of
swagger
and
a
grave-enough
*NL*
face
.
It
is
eight
o'clock
now
,
and
the
day
is
fast
drawing
in
.
He
*NL*
stops
hard
by
Waterloo
Bridge
and
reads
a
playbill
,
decides
to
go
to
*NL*
Astley
's
Theatre
.
Being
there
,
is
much
delighted
with
the
horses
and
*NL*
the
feats
of
strength
;
looks
at
the
weapons
with
a
critical
eye
;
*NL*
disapproves
of
the
combats
as
giving
evidences
of
unskilful
*NL*
swordsmanship
;
but
is
touched
home
by
the
sentiments
.
In
the
last
*NL*
scene
,
when
the
Emperor
of
Tartary
gets
up
into
a
cart
and
*NL*
condescends
to
bless
the
united
lovers
by
hovering
over
them
with
the
*NL*
Union
Jack
,
his
eyelashes
are
moistened
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theatre
over
,
Mr.
George
comes
across
the
water
again
and
makes
*NL*
his
way
to
that
curious
region
lying
about
the
Haymarket
and
*NL*
Leicester
Square
which
is
a
centre
of
attraction
to
indifferent
*NL*
foreign
hotels
and
indifferent
foreigners
,
racket-courts
,
*NL*
fighting-men
,
swordsmen
,
footguards
,
old
china
,
gaming-houses
,
*NL*
exhibitions
,
and
a
large
medley
of
shabbiness
and
shrinking
out
of
*NL*
sight
.
Penetrating
to
the
heart
of
this
region
,
he
arrives
by
a
court
*NL*
and
a
long
whitewashed
passage
at
a
great
brick
building
composed
of
*NL*
bare
walls
,
floors
,
roof-rafters
,
and
skylights
,
on
the
front
of
*NL*
which
,
if
it
can
be
said
to
have
any
front
,
is
painted
GEORGE
'S
*NL*
SHOOTING
GALLERY
,
&
c.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
George
's
Shooting
Gallery
,
&
c.
,
he
goes
;
and
in
it
there
are
*NL*
gaslights
-LRB-
partly
turned
off
now
-RRB-
,
and
two
whitened
targets
for
*NL*
rifle-shooting
,
and
archery
accommodation
,
and
fencing
appliances
,
*NL*
and
all
necessaries
for
the
British
art
of
boxing
.
None
of
these
*NL*
sports
or
exercises
being
pursued
in
George
's
Shooting
Gallery
*NL*
to-night
,
which
is
so
devoid
of
company
that
a
little
grotesque
man
*NL*
with
a
large
head
has
it
all
to
himself
and
lies
asleep
upon
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
man
is
dressed
something
like
a
gunsmith
,
in
a
green-baize
*NL*
apron
and
cap
;
and
his
face
and
hands
are
dirty
with
gunpowder
and
*NL*
begrimed
with
the
loading
of
guns
.
As
he
lies
in
the
light
before
a
*NL*
glaring
white
target
,
the
black
upon
him
shines
again
.
Not
far
off
is
*NL*
the
strong
,
rough
,
primitive
table
with
a
vice
upon
it
at
which
he
*NL*
has
been
working
.
He
is
a
little
man
with
a
face
all
crushed
*NL*
together
,
who
appears
,
from
a
certain
blue
and
speckled
appearance
*NL*
that
one
of
his
cheeks
presents
,
to
have
been
blown
up
,
in
the
way
of
*NL*
business
,
at
some
odd
time
or
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phil
!
''
says
the
trooper
in
a
quiet
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
cries
Phil
,
scrambling
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
been
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flat
as
ever
so
much
swipes
,
''
says
Phil
.
``
Five
dozen
rifle
and
a
*NL*
dozen
pistol
.
As
to
aim
!
''
Phil
gives
a
howl
at
the
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
shop
,
Phil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Phil
moves
about
to
execute
this
order
,
it
appears
that
he
is
*NL*
lame
,
though
able
to
move
very
quickly
.
On
the
speckled
side
of
his
*NL*
face
he
has
no
eyebrow
,
and
on
the
other
side
he
has
a
bushy
black
*NL*
one
,
which
want
of
uniformity
gives
him
a
very
singular
and
rather
*NL*
sinister
appearance
.
Everything
seems
to
have
happened
to
his
hands
*NL*
that
could
possibly
take
place
consistently
with
the
retention
of
all
*NL*
the
fingers
,
for
they
are
notched
,
and
seamed
,
and
crumpled
all
over
.
*NL*
He
appears
to
be
very
strong
and
lifts
heavy
benches
about
as
if
he
*NL*
had
no
idea
what
weight
was
.
He
has
a
curious
way
of
limping
round
*NL*
the
gallery
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
and
tacking
off
at
*NL*
objects
he
wants
to
lay
hold
of
instead
of
going
straight
to
them
,
*NL*
which
has
left
a
smear
all
round
the
four
walls
,
conventionally
*NL*
called
``
Phil
's
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
custodian
of
George
's
Gallery
in
George
's
absence
concludes
his
*NL*
proceedings
,
when
he
has
locked
the
great
doors
and
turned
out
all
*NL*
the
lights
but
one
,
which
he
leaves
to
glimmer
,
by
dragging
out
from
*NL*
a
wooden
cabin
in
a
corner
two
mattresses
and
bedding
.
These
being
*NL*
drawn
to
opposite
ends
of
the
gallery
,
the
trooper
makes
his
own
bed
*NL*
and
Phil
makes
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phil
!
''
says
the
master
,
walking
towards
him
without
his
coat
and
*NL*
waistcoat
,
and
looking
more
soldierly
than
ever
in
his
braces
.
``
You
*NL*
were
found
in
a
doorway
,
were
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gutter
,
''
says
Phil
.
``
Watchman
tumbled
over
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
vagabondizing
came
natural
to
YOU
from
the
beginning

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
nat

as
possible

says
Phil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night

''
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
can
not
even
go
straight
to
bed
,
but
finds
it
necessary
to
*NL*
shoulder
round
two
sides
of
the
gallery
and
then
tack
off
at
his
*NL*
mattress
.
The
trooper
,
after
taking
a
turn
or
two
in
the
*NL*
rifle-distance
and
looking
up
at
the
moon
now
shining
through
the
*NL*
skylights
,
strides
to
his
own
mattress
by
a
shorter
route
and
goes
to
*NL*
bed
too
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Allegory
looks
pretty
cool
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
though
the
*NL*
evening
is
hot
,
for
both
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
windows
are
wide
open
,
and
*NL*
the
room
is
lofty
,
gusty
,
and
gloomy
.
These
may
not
be
desirable
*NL*
characteristics
when
November
comes
with
fog
and
sleet
or
January
*NL*
with
ice
and
snow
,
but
they
have
their
merits
in
the
sultry
long
*NL*
vacation
weather
.
They
enable
Allegory
,
though
it
has
cheeks
like
*NL*
peaches
,
and
knees
like
bunches
of
blossoms
,
and
rosy
swellings
for
*NL*
calves
to
its
legs
and
muscles
to
its
arms
,
to
look
tolerably
cool
*NL*
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Plenty
of
dust
comes
in
at
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
windows
,
and
plenty
more
*NL*
has
generated
among
his
furniture
and
papers
.
It
lies
thick
*NL*
everywhere
.
When
a
breeze
from
the
country
that
has
lost
its
way
*NL*
takes
fright
and
makes
a
blind
hurry
to
rush
out
again
,
it
flings
as
*NL*
much
dust
in
the
eyes
of
Allegory
as
the
law
--
or
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
one
*NL*
of
its
trustiest
representatives
--
may
scatter
,
on
occasion
,
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
laity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
lowering
magazine
of
dust
,
the
universal
article
into
which
*NL*
his
papers
and
himself
,
and
all
his
clients
,
and
all
things
of
earth
,
*NL*
animate
and
inanimate
,
are
resolving
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
sits
at
one
of
*NL*
the
open
windows
enjoying
a
bottle
of
old
port
.
Though
a
hard-grained
*NL*
man
,
close
,
dry
,
and
silent
,
he
can
enjoy
old
wine
with
the
best
.
He
*NL*
has
a
priceless
bin
of
port
in
some
artful
cellar
under
the
Fields
,
*NL*
which
is
one
of
his
many
secrets
.
When
he
dines
alone
in
chambers
,
as
*NL*
he
has
dined
to-day
,
and
has
his
bit
of
fish
and
his
steak
or
chicken
*NL*
brought
in
from
the
coffee-house
,
he
descends
with
a
candle
to
the
*NL*
echoing
regions
below
the
deserted
mansion
,
and
heralded
by
a
remote
*NL*
reverberation
of
thundering
doors
,
comes
gravely
back
encircled
by
an
*NL*
earthy
atmosphere
and
carrying
a
bottle
from
which
he
pours
a
radiant
*NL*
nectar
,
two
score
and
ten
years
old
,
that
blushes
in
the
glass
to
*NL*
find
itself
so
famous
and
fills
the
whole
room
with
the
fragrance
of
*NL*
southern
grapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
the
open
window
,
enjoys
*NL*
his
wine
.
As
if
it
whispered
to
him
of
its
fifty
years
of
silence
and
*NL*
seclusion
,
it
shuts
him
up
the
closer
.
More
impenetrable
than
ever
,
*NL*
he
sits
,
and
drinks
,
and
mellows
as
it
were
in
secrecy
,
pondering
at
*NL*
that
twilight
hour
on
all
the
mysteries
he
knows
,
associated
with
*NL*
darkening
woods
in
the
country
,
and
vast
blank
shut-up
houses
in
*NL*
town
,
and
perhaps
sparing
a
thought
or
two
for
himself
,
and
his
*NL*
family
history
,
and
his
money
,
and
his
will
--
all
a
mystery
to
every
*NL*
one
--
and
that
one
bachelor
friend
of
his
,
a
man
of
the
same
mould
and
*NL*
a
lawyer
too
,
who
lived
the
same
kind
of
life
until
he
was
*NL*
seventy-five
years
old
,
and
then
suddenly
conceiving
-LRB-
as
it
is
*NL*
supposed
-RRB-
an
impression
that
it
was
too
monotonous
,
gave
his
gold
*NL*
watch
to
his
hair-dresser
one
summer
evening
and
walked
leisurely
*NL*
home
to
the
Temple
and
hanged
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
not
alone
to-night
to
ponder
at
his
usual
*NL*
length
.
Seated
at
the
same
table
,
though
with
his
chair
modestly
and
*NL*
uncomfortably
drawn
a
little
way
from
it
,
sits
a
bald
,
mild
,
shining
*NL*
man
who
coughs
respectfully
behind
his
hand
when
the
lawyer
bids
him
*NL*
fill
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Snagsby
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
``
to
go
over
this
odd
story
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
step
round
here
last
*NL*
night
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
which
I
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
if
it
was
a
liberty
,
sir
;
but
*NL*
I
remember
that
you
had
taken
a
sort
of
an
interest
in
that
person
,
*NL*
and
I
thought
it
possible
that
you
might
--
just
--
wish
--
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
not
the
man
to
help
him
to
any
conclusion
or
to
*NL*
admit
anything
as
to
any
possibility
concerning
himself
.
So
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
trails
off
into
saying
,
with
an
awkward
cough
,
``
I
must
ask
*NL*
you
to
excuse
the
liberty
,
sir
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
``
You
told
me
,
Snagsby
,
that
you
*NL*
put
on
your
hat
and
came
round
without
mentioning
your
intention
to
*NL*
your
wife
.
That
was
prudent
I
think
,
because
it
's
not
a
matter
of
*NL*
such
importance
that
it
requires
to
be
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
returns
Mr.
Snagsby
,
``
you
see
,
my
little
woman
is
--
not
*NL*
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it

inquisitive
.
She
's
inquisitive
.
Poor
*NL*
little
thing
,
she
's
liable
to
spasms
,
and
it
's
good
for
her
to
have
*NL*
her
mind
employed
.
In
consequence
of
which
she
employs
it
--
I
should
*NL*
say
upon
every
individual
thing
she
can
lay
hold
of
,
whether
it
*NL*
concerns
her
or
not
--
especially
not
.
My
little
woman
has
a
very
*NL*
active
mind
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
drinks
and
murmurs
with
an
admiring
cough
behind
his
*NL*
hand
,
``
Dear
me
,
very
fine
wine
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
you
kept
your
visit
to
yourself
last
night
?
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
.
``
And
to-night
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
and
to-night
,
too

My
little
woman
is
at
present
in
--
not
*NL*
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
--
in
a
pious
state
,
or
in
what
she
*NL*
considers
such
,
and
attends
the
Evening
Exertions
-LRB-
which
is
the
name
*NL*
they
go
by
-RRB-
of
a
reverend
party
of
the
name
of
Chadband
.
He
has
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
eloquence
at
his
command
,
undoubtedly
,
but
I
am
not
*NL*
quite
favourable
to
his
style
myself
.
That
's
neither
here
nor
there
.
*NL*
My
little
woman
being
engaged
in
that
way
made
it
easier
for
me
to
*NL*
step
round
in
a
quiet
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
assents
.
``
Fill
your
glass
,
Snagsby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
I
am
sure
,
''
returns
the
stationer
with
his
cough
of
*NL*
deference
.
``
This
is
wonderfully
fine
wine
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
rare
wine
now
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
``
It
is
fifty
years
*NL*
old

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
indeed

But
I
am
not
surprised
to
hear
it

I
am
sure

It
*NL*
might
be

any
age
almost
.
''
After
rendering
this
general
tribute
to
*NL*
the
port
,
Mr.
Snagsby
in
his
modesty
coughs
an
apology
behind
his
*NL*
hand
for
drinking
anything
so
precious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
run
over
,
once
again
,
what
the
boy
said
?
''
asks
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
,
putting
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
rusty
*NL*
smallclothes
and
leaning
quietly
back
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
with
fidelity
,
though
with
some
prolixity
,
the
law-stationer
*NL*
repeats
Jo
's
statement
made
to
the
assembled
guests
at
his
house
.
On
*NL*
coming
to
the
end
of
his
narrative
,
he
gives
a
great
start
and
breaks
*NL*
off
with
,
``
Dear
me
,
sir
,
I
was
n't
aware
there
was
any
other
gentleman
*NL*
present
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
is
dismayed
to
see
,
standing
with
an
attentive
face
*NL*
between
himself
and
the
lawyer
at
a
little
distance
from
the
table
,
a
*NL*
person
with
a
hat
and
stick
in
his
hand
who
was
not
there
when
he
*NL*
himself
came
in
and
has
not
since
entered
by
the
door
or
by
either
of
*NL*
the
windows
.
There
is
a
press
in
the
room
,
but
its
hinges
have
not
*NL*
creaked
,
nor
has
a
step
been
audible
upon
the
floor
.
Yet
this
third
*NL*
person
stands
there
with
his
attentive
face
,
and
his
hat
and
stick
in
*NL*
his
hands
,
and
his
hands
behind
him
,
a
composed
and
quiet
listener
.
*NL*
He
is
a
stoutly
built
,
steady-looking
,
sharp-eyed
man
in
black
,
of
*NL*
about
the
middle-age
.
Except
that
he
looks
at
Mr.
Snagsby
as
if
he
*NL*
were
going
to
take
his
portrait
,
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
*NL*
him
at
first
sight
but
his
ghostly
manner
of
appearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
this
gentleman
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
in
his
quiet
way
.
*NL*
``
This
is
only
Mr.
Bucket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
sir
?
''
returns
the
stationer
,
expressing
by
a
cough
that
*NL*
he
is
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
who
Mr.
Bucket
may
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
him
to
hear
this
story
,
''
says
the
lawyer
,
``
because
I
have
*NL*
half
a
mind
-LRB-
for
a
reason
-RRB-
to
know
more
of
it

and
he
is
very
*NL*
intelligent
in
such
things
.
What
do
you
say
to
this
,
Bucket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
plain
,
sir

Since
our
people
have
moved
this

on
,
and
*NL*
he
's
not
to
be
found
on

old
lay

do
n't
object
to
*NL*
go
down
with
me
to
Tom-all-Alone

and
point
him
out
,
we
can
have
him
*NL*
here
in
less
than
a
couple
of
hours
'
time
.
I
can
do
it
without
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
,
of
course
,
but
this
is
the
shortest
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bucket
is
a
detective
officer
,
Snagsby
,
''
says
the
lawyer
in
*NL*
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
indeed
,
sir
?
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
with
a
strong
tendency
in
his
*NL*
clump
of
hair
to
stand
on
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
have
no
real
objection
to
accompany
Mr.
Bucket
to
the
*NL*
place
in
question
,
''
pursues
the
lawyer
,
``
I
shall
feel
obliged
to
you
*NL*
if
you
will
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
's
hesitation
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Snagsby
,
Bucket
dips
down
*NL*
to
the
bottom
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
of
hurting
the
boy
,
''
he
says
.
``
You
wo
n't
do
*NL*
that

It
's
all
right

the

concerned

We
shall
only
*NL*
bring
him
here
to
ask
him
a
question

so
I
want
to
put
to
him

*NL*
he
'll
be
paid
for
his
trouble

sent
away
again

be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

cries
Mr.

cheerfully

And
*NL*
reassured

``
Since

's
the
case

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

And
lookee
here

resumes
Bucket
,
taking
him
aside
*NL*
by
the
arm
,
tapping
him
familiarly
on
the
breast
,
and
speaking
in
a
*NL*
confidential
tone
.
``
You

*NL*

engaging

of
frankness

``

pursues
Bucket

again
tapping
Mr.
Snagsby
on
*NL*
the
breast
in
a
comfortable

soothing

returns
his

They
leave
Mr.

,
without
a
ruffle
on
the
surface
of
his
*NL*
unfathomable
depths
,
drinking
his
old
wine
,
and
go
down
into
the
*NL*
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
a
very
good
sort

Gridley

do
you
?
''
says
Bucket
in
friendly
converse
as
they
descend
*NL*
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
Mr.

considering
,
``

know
anybody

Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
particular

''
says
Bucket
;
``
only
having
allowed
his
temper
to
*NL*
get
a
little
the
better
of
him
and
having
been
threatening
some
*NL*
respectable
people
,
he
is
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
a
warrant
I
have
*NL*
got
against
him
--
which
it
's
a
pity
that
a
man
of
sense
should
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
walk
along
,
Mr.
Snagsby
observes
,
as
a
novelty
,
that
however
*NL*
quick
their
pace
may
be
,
his
companion
still
seems
in
some
*NL*
undefinable
manner
to
lurk
and
lounge
;
also
,
that
whenever
he
is
*NL*
going
to
turn
to
the
right
or
left
,
he
pretends
to
have
a
fixed
*NL*
purpose
in
his
mind
of
going
straight
ahead
,
and
wheels
off
,
sharply
,
*NL*
at
the
very
last
moment
.
Now
and
then
,
when
they
pass
a
*NL*
police-constable
on
his
beat
,
Mr.
Snagsby
notices
that
both
the
*NL*
constable
and
his
guide
fall
into
a
deep
abstraction
as
they
come
*NL*
towards
each
other
,
and
appear
entirely
to
overlook
each
other
,
and
*NL*
to
gaze
into
space
.
In
a
few
instances
,
Mr.
Bucket
,
coming
behind
*NL*
some
under-sized
young
man
with
a
shining
hat
on
,
and
his
sleek
hair
*NL*
twisted
into
one
flat
curl
on
each
side
of
his
head
,
almost
without
*NL*
glancing
at
him
touches
him
with
his
stick
,
upon
which
the
young
man
,
*NL*
looking
round
,
instantly
evaporates
.
For
the
most
part
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
notices
things
in
general
,
with
a
face
as
unchanging
as
the
great
*NL*
mourning
ring
on
his
little
finger
or
the
brooch
,
composed
of
not
*NL*
much
diamond
and
a
good
deal
of
setting
,
which
he
wears
in
his
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
come
at
last
to
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
Mr.
Bucket
stops
for
a
*NL*
moment
at
the
corner
and
takes
a
lighted
bull
's
-
eye
from
the
*NL*
constable
on
duty
there
,
who
then
accompanies
him
with
his
own
*NL*
particular
bull
's
-
eye
at
his
waist
.
Between
his
two
conductors
,
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
passes
along
the
middle
of
a
villainous
street
,
undrained
,
*NL*
unventilated
,
deep
in
black
mud
and
corrupt
water
--
though
the
roads
*NL*
are
dry
elsewhere
--
and
reeking
with
such
smells
and
sights
that
he
,
*NL*
who
has
lived
in
London
all
his
life
,
can
scarce
believe
his
senses
.
*NL*
Branching
from
this
street
and
its
heaps
of
ruins
are
other
streets
*NL*
and
courts
so
infamous
that
Mr.
Snagsby
sickens
in
body
and
mind
and
*NL*
feels
as
if
he
were
going
every
moment
deeper
down
into
the
infernal
*NL*
gulf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
off
a
bit
here
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
''
says
Bucket
as
a
kind
of
shabby
*NL*
palanquin
is
borne
towards
them
,
surrounded
by
a
noisy
crowd
.
``
Here
's
*NL*
the
fever
coming
up
the
street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
unseen
wretch
goes
by
,
the
crowd
,
leaving
that
object
of
*NL*
attraction
,
hovers
round
the
three
visitors
like
a
dream
of
horrible
*NL*
faces
and
fades
away
up
alleys
and
into
ruins
and
behind
walls
,
and
*NL*
with
occasional
cries
and
shrill
whistles
of
warning
,
thenceforth
*NL*
flits
about
them
until
they
leave
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
those
the
fever-houses
,
Darby
?
''
Mr.
Bucket
coolly
asks
as
he
*NL*
turns
his
bull
's
-
eye
on
a
line
of
stinking
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darby
replies
that
``
all
them
are
,
''
and
further
that
in
all
,
for
*NL*
months
and
months
,
the
people
``
have
been
down
by
dozens
''
and
have
*NL*
been
carried
out
dead
and
dying
``
like
sheep
with
the
rot
.
''
Bucket
*NL*
observing
to
Mr.
Snagsby
as
they
go
on
again
that
he
looks
a
little
*NL*
poorly
,
Mr.
Snagsby
answers
that
he
feels
as
if
he
could
n't
breathe
*NL*
the
dreadful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
inquiry
made
at
various
houses
for
a
boy
named
Jo
.
As
few
*NL*
people
are
known
in
Tom-all-Alone
's
by
any
Christian
sign
,
there
is
*NL*
much
reference
to
Mr.
Snagsby
whether
he
means
Carrots
,
or
the
*NL*
Colonel
,
or
Gallows
,
or
Young
Chisel
,
or
Terrier
Tip
,
or
Lanky
,
or
*NL*
the
Brick
.
Mr.
Snagsby
describes
over
and
over
again
.
There
are
*NL*
conflicting
opinions
respecting
the
original
of
his
picture
.
Some
*NL*
think
it
must
be
Carrots
,
some
say
the
Brick
.
The
Colonel
is
*NL*
produced
,
but
is
not
at
all
near
the
thing
.
Whenever
Mr.
Snagsby
and
*NL*
his
conductors
are
stationary
,
the
crowd
flows
round
,
and
from
its
*NL*
squalid
depths
obsequious
advice
heaves
up
to
Mr.
Bucket
.
Whenever
*NL*
they
move
,
and
the
angry
bull
's
-
eyes
glare
,
it
fades
away
and
flits
*NL*
about
them
up
the
alleys
,
and
in
the
ruins
,
and
behind
the
walls
,
as
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
there
is
a
lair
found
out
where
Toughy
,
or
the
Tough
Subject
,
*NL*
lays
him
down
at
night
;
and
it
is
thought
that
the
Tough
Subject
may
*NL*
be
Jo
.
Comparison
of
notes
between
Mr.
Snagsby
and
the
proprietress
*NL*
of
the
house
--
a
drunken
face
tied
up
in
a
black
bundle
,
and
flaring
*NL*
out
of
a
heap
of
rags
on
the
floor
of
a
dog-hutch
which
is
her
*NL*
private
apartment
--
leads
to
the
establishment
of
this
conclusion
.
*NL*
Toughy
has
gone
to
the
doctor
's
to
get
a
bottle
of
stuff
for
a
sick
*NL*
woman
but
will
be
here
anon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
have
we
got
here
to-night
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
opening
another
*NL*
door
and
glaring
in
with
his
bull
's
-
eye
.
``
Two
drunken
men
,
eh
?
And
*NL*
two
women
?
The
men
are
sound
enough
,
''
turning
back
each
sleeper
's
arm
*NL*
from
his
face
to
look
at
him
.
``
Are
these
your
good
men
,
my
dears
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
returns
one
of
the
women
.
``
They
are
our

*NL*
*NL*
``
Brickmakers

eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here

You

``
No

up
yesterday

's

no

by
coming
here
,
and
shall
do
none

I
expect

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
the
way
to
do
much
good
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
turning
his
*NL*
head
in
the
direction
of
the
unconscious
figures
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
a
n't
indeed
,
''
replies
the
woman
with
a
sigh
.
``
Jenny
and
me
knows
*NL*
it
full
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
,
though
two
or
three
feet
higher
than
the
door
,
is
so
low
*NL*
that
the
head
of
the
tallest
of
the
visitors
would
touch
the
*NL*
blackened
ceiling
if
he
stood
upright
.
It
is
offensive
to
every
*NL*
sense
;
even
the
gross
candle
burns
pale
and
sickly
in
the
polluted
*NL*
air
.
There
are
a
couple
of
benches
and
a
higher
bench
by
way
of
*NL*
table
.
The
men
lie
asleep
where
they
stumbled
down
,
but
the
women
sit
*NL*
by
the
candle
.
Lying
in
the
arms
of
the
woman
who
has
spoken
is
a
*NL*
very
young
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
age
do
you
call
that
little
creature
?
''
says
Bucket
.
``
It
*NL*
looks
as
if
it
was
born
yesterday
.
''
He
is
not
at
all
rough
about
it
;
*NL*
and
as
he
turns
his
light
gently
on
the
infant
,
Mr.
Snagsby
is
*NL*
strangely
reminded
of
another
infant
,
encircled
with
light
,
that
he
*NL*
has
seen
in
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
three
weeks
old
yet

says
the
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
woman
,
who
was
bending
over
it
when
they
came
in
,
stoops
*NL*
down
again
and
kisses
it
as
it
lies
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
as
fond
of
it
as
if
you
were
the
mother
yourself

says
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
mother
of
one

master
,
and
it
died

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Jenny

Jenny

says
the

to
her

``
Better

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

you
a

such
an

returns
Bucket
*NL*
sternly
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows

I

*NL*
``
Then

Mr.

mollified

again

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

brought
into

returns
the

her
eyes
*NL*
filling
with
tears
,
``

down

look
around

glancing
at
the
sleepers
on
the
ground

at
the

Think
of

often

that

see
grow
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well

says
Mr.

,
``
you
train
him
respectable

and
he
'll

be
a
comfort
to
you

look
after

in
your
old
age
,
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
try
hard
,
''
she
answers
,
wiping
her
eyes
.
``
But
I
have
been
*NL*
a-thinking
,
being
over-tired
to-night
and
not
well
with
the
ague

of
*NL*
all
the
many
things
that
'll
come
in
his
way
.
My
master
will
be
*NL*
against
it
,
and
he
'll
be
beat
,
and
see
me
beat
,
and
made
to
fear
his
*NL*
home
,
and
perhaps
to
stray
wild
.
If
I
work
for
him
ever
so
much
,
and
*NL*
ever
so
hard

there
's
no
one

bad

the
time
should
come

sit
by

in
his
sleep

made
hard

changed

a

it
likely
I

should
think
of
him

he
lies
in
my

died

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

you
're
tired

me
take

him

*NL*
*NL*
In
doing
so
,
she
displaces
the
mother
's
dress
,
but
quickly
readjusts
*NL*
it
over
the
wounded
and
bruised
bosom
where
the
baby
has
been
lying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
dead
child

''
says
Jenny
,
walking
up
and
down
as
she
nurses
,
*NL*
``
that
makes

love
this
child

and
it
's
my
dead

so

too

as
even
to
think
of
its
being
taken
*NL*
away
from

now

While
she
thinks
that
,
I
think
what
fortune
would
*NL*
I
give
to
have
my

But
we

the

it

*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Snagsby
blows
his
nose
and
coughs
his
cough
of
sympathy
,
a
*NL*
step
is
heard
without
.
Mr.
Bucket
throws
his
light
into
the
doorway
*NL*
and
says
to
Mr.
Snagsby
,
``
Now
,
what
do
you
say
to
Toughy
?
Will
HE
*NL*
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Jo

''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
stands
amazed
in
the
disk
of
light
,
like
a
ragged
figure
in
a
*NL*
magic-lantern
,
trembling
to
think
that
he
has
offended
against
the
*NL*
law
in
not
having
moved
on
far
enough
.
Mr.
Snagsby
,
however
,
giving
*NL*
him
the
consolatory
assurance
,
``
It
's
only
a
job
you
will
be
paid
for
,
*NL*
Jo
,
''
he
recovers
;
and
on
being
taken
outside
by
Mr.
Bucket
for
a
*NL*
little
private
confabulation
,
tells
his
tale
satisfactorily
,
though
*NL*
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
squared
it
with
the
lad
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
returning
,
``
and
*NL*
it
's
all
right
.
Now
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
we
're
ready
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
Jo
has
to
complete
his
errand
of
good
nature
by
handing
over
*NL*
the
physic
he
has
been
to
get
,
which
he
delivers
with
the
laconic
*NL*
verbal
direction
that
``
it
's
to
be
all
took
d'rectly
.
''
Secondly
,
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
has
to
lay
upon
the
table
half
a
crown
,
his
usual
panacea
for
*NL*
an
immense
variety
of
afflictions
.
Thirdly
,
Mr.
Bucket
has
to
take
Jo
*NL*
by
the
arm
a
little
above
the
elbow
and
walk
him
on
before
him
,
*NL*
without
which
observance
neither
the
Tough
Subject
nor
any
other
*NL*
Subject
could
be
professionally
conducted
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
.
*NL*
These
arrangements
completed
,
they
give
the
women
good
night
and
come
*NL*
out
once
more
into
black
and
foul
Tom-all-Alone
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
noisome
ways
through
which
they
descended
into
that
pit
,
they
*NL*
gradually
emerge
from
it
,
the
crowd
flitting
,
and
whistling
,
and
*NL*
skulking
about
them
until
they
come
to
the
verge
,
where
restoration
*NL*
of
the
bull
's
-
eyes
is
made
to
Darby
.
Here
the
crowd
,
like
a
concourse
*NL*
of
imprisoned
demons
,
turns
back
,
yelling
,
and
is
seen
no
more
.
*NL*
Through
the
clearer
and
fresher
streets
,
never
so
clear
and
fresh
to
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
's
mind
as
now
,
they
walk
and
ride
until
they
come
to
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
's
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
ascend
the
dim
stairs
-LRB-
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
chambers
being
on
*NL*
the
first
floor
-RRB-
,
Mr.
Bucket
mentions
that
he
has
the
key
of
the
*NL*
outer
door
in
his
pocket
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
ring
.
For
a
man
*NL*
so
expert
in
most
things
of
that
kind
,
Bucket
takes
time
to
open
the
*NL*
door
and
makes
some
noise
too
.
It
may
be
that
he
sounds
a
note
of
*NL*
preparation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Howbeit
,
they
come
at
last
into
the
hall
,
where
a
lamp
is
burning
,
*NL*
and
so
into
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
usual
room
--
the
room
where
he
drank
his
*NL*
old
wine
to-night
.
He
is
not
there
,
but
his
two
old-fashioned
*NL*
candlesticks
are
,
and
the
room
is
tolerably
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
,
still
having
his
professional
hold
of
Jo
and
appearing
to
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
to
possess
an
unlimited
number
of
eyes
,
makes
a
little
*NL*
way
into
this
room
,
when
Jo
starts
and
stops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
says
Bucket
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
!
''
cries
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
female
figure
,
closely
veiled
,
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
*NL*
where
the
light
falls
upon
it
.
It
is
quite
still
and
silent
.
The
*NL*
front
of
the
figure
is
towards
them
,
but
it
takes
no
notice
of
their
*NL*
entrance
and
remains
like
a
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
tell
me
,
''
says
Bucket
aloud
,
``
how
you
know
that
to
be
the
*NL*
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
wale
,
''
replies
Jo
,
staring
,
``
and
the
bonnet
,
and
the
*NL*
gownd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quite
sure
of
what
you
say
,
Tough
,
''
returns
Bucket
,
narrowly
*NL*
observant
of
him
.
``
Look
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a-looking
as
hard
as
ever
I
can
look
,
''
says
Jo
with
starting
*NL*
eyes
,
``
and
that
there
's
the
wale
,
the
bonnet
,
and
the
gownd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
those
rings
you
told
me
of
?
''
asks
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-sparkling
all
over
here
,
''
says
Jo
,
rubbing
the
fingers
of
his
left
*NL*
hand
on
the
knuckles
of
his
right
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
*NL*
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
removes
the
right-hand
glove
and
shows
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
do
you
say
to
that
?
''
asks
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
shakes
his
head
.
``
Not
rings
a
bit
like
them
.
Not
a
hand
like
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
of
?
''
says
Bucket
,
evidently
pleased
though
,
and
*NL*
well
pleased
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hand
was
a
deal
whiter
,
a
deal
delicater
,
and
a
deal
smaller
,
''
*NL*
returns
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
'll
tell
me
I
'm
my
own
mother
next
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
recollect
the
lady
's
voice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
does
,
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
speaks
.
``
Was
it
at
all
like
this
?
I
will
speak
as
long
as
*NL*
you
like
if
you
are
not
sure
.
Was
it
this
voice
,
or
at
all
like
this
*NL*
voice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
looks
aghast
at
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Not
a
bit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
what
,
''
retorts
that
worthy
,
pointing
to
the
figure
,
``
did
you
*NL*
say
it
was
the
lady
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cos
,
''
says
Jo
with
a
perplexed
stare
but
without
being
at
all
shaken
*NL*
in
his
certainty
,
``
cos
that
there
's
the
wale
,
the
bonnet
,
and
the
*NL*
gownd
.
It
is
her
and
it
a
n't
her
.
It
a
n't
her
hand
,
nor
yet
her
*NL*
rings
,
nor
yet
her
woice

But
that
there
's
the
wale
,
the
bonnet
,
and
*NL*
the
gownd
,
and
they
're
wore
the
same
way
wot
she
wore
'em
,
and
it
's
*NL*
her
height
wot
she
wos
,
and
she
giv
me
a
sov
`
ring
and
hooked
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
slightly
,
``
we
have
n't
got
much
good
out
of
*NL*
YOU
.
But
,
however
,
here
's
five
shillings
for
you
.
Take
care
how
you
*NL*
spend
it
,
and
do
n't
get
yourself
into
trouble
.
''
Bucket
stealthily
*NL*
tells
the
coins
from
one
hand
into
the
other
like
counters
--
which
is
*NL*
a
way
he
has
,
his
principal
use
of
them
being
in
these
games
of
*NL*
skill
--
and
then
puts
them
,
in
a
little
pile
,
into
the
boy
's
hand
and
*NL*
takes
him
out
to
the
door
,
leaving
Mr.
Snagsby
,
not
by
any
means
*NL*
comfortable
under
these
mysterious
circumstances
,
alone
with
the
*NL*
veiled
figure
.
But
on
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
coming
into
the
room
,
the
*NL*
veil
is
raised
and
a
sufficiently
good-looking
Frenchwoman
is
*NL*
revealed
,
though
her
expression
is
something
of
the
intensest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mademoiselle
Hortense
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
with
his
*NL*
usual
equanimity
.
``
I
will
give
you
no
further
trouble
about
this
*NL*
little
wager

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

says
mademoiselle

*NL*

Certainly

And

*NL*

``
A

*NL*
Mademoiselle
goes
out
with
an
air
of
native
gentility
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
to
whom
it
is
,
on
an
emergency
,
as
natural
to
be
groom
of
the
*NL*
ceremonies
as
it
is
to
be
anything
else
,
shows
her
downstairs
,
not
*NL*
without
gallantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Bucket

quoth
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
on
his
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

all
squared

There

*NL*
doubt
that
it
was
the
other
one
with
this
one

dress
on

The
boy
was
*NL*
exact
respecting
colours

everything

Mr.
Snagsby
,
I
promised
you

as
a
man
that
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
kept

returns
the
stationer
;
``

if

of
no

I

*NL*
``
You

says
Mr.

,
accompanying
him
to
the
door
*NL*
and
shaking
hands
with
him
over
and
over
again
,
``
what
I

When

No

shaking

blessing
him
in

tenderest

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
makes
a
suitable
response
and
goes
homeward
so
confused
*NL*
by
the
events
of
the
evening
that
he
is
doubtful
of
his
being
awake
*NL*
and
out
--
doubtful
of
the
reality
of
the
streets
through
which
he
*NL*
goes
--
doubtful
of
the
reality
of
the
moon
that
shines
above
him
.
He
*NL*
is
presently
reassured
on
these
subjects
by
the
unchallengeable
*NL*
reality
of
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
sitting
up
with
her
head
in
a
perfect
*NL*
beehive
of
curl-papers
and
night-cap
,
who
has
dispatched
Guster
to
*NL*
the
police-station
with
official
intelligence
of
her
husband
's
being
*NL*
made
away
with
,
and
who
within
the
last
two
hours
has
passed
through
*NL*
every
stage
of
swooning
with
the
greatest
decorum
.
But
as
the
little
*NL*
woman
feelingly
says
,
many
thanks
she
gets
for
it
!

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
home
from
Mr.
Boythorn
's
after
six
pleasant
weeks
.
We
were
*NL*
often
in
the
park
and
in
the
woods
and
seldom
passed
the
lodge
where
*NL*
we
had
taken
shelter
without
looking
in
to
speak
to
the
keeper
's
*NL*
wife
;
but
we
saw
no
more
of
Lady
Dedlock
,
except
at
church
on
*NL*
Sundays
.
There
was
company
at
Chesney
Wold
;
and
although
several
*NL*
beautiful
faces
surrounded
her
,
her
face
retained
the
same
influence
*NL*
on
me
as
at
first
.
I
do
not
quite
know
even
now
whether
it
was
*NL*
painful
or
pleasurable
,
whether
it
drew
me
towards
her
or
made
me
*NL*
shrink
from
her
.
I
think
I
admired
her
with
a
kind
of
fear
,
and
I
*NL*
know
that
in
her
presence
my
thoughts
always
wandered
back
,
as
they
*NL*
had
done
at
first
,
to
that
old
time
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
fancy
,
on
more
than
one
of
these
Sundays
,
that
what
this
lady
*NL*
so
curiously
was
to
me
,
I
was
to
her
--
I
mean
that
I
disturbed
her
*NL*
thoughts
as
she
influenced
mine
,
though
in
some
different
way
.
But
*NL*
when
I
stole
a
glance
at
her
and
saw
her
so
composed
and
distant
and
*NL*
unapproachable
,
I
felt
this
to
be
a
foolish
weakness
.
Indeed
,
I
felt
*NL*
the
whole
state
of
my
mind
in
reference
to
her
to
be
weak
and
*NL*
unreasonable
,
and
I
remonstrated
with
myself
about
it
as
much
as
I
*NL*
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
incident
that
occurred
before
we
quitted
Mr.
Boythorn
's
house
,
I
*NL*
had
better
mention
in
this
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
walking
in
the
garden
with
Ada
when
I
was
told
that
some
one
*NL*
wished
to
see
me
.
Going
into
the
breakfast-room
where
this
person
was
*NL*
waiting
,
I
found
it
to
be
the
French
maid
who
had
cast
off
her
shoes
*NL*
and
walked
through
the
wet
grass
on
the
day
when
it
thundered
and
*NL*
lightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
''
she
began
,
looking
fixedly
at
me
with
her
too-eager
*NL*
eyes
,
though
otherwise
presenting
an
agreeable
appearance
and
*NL*
speaking
neither
with
boldness
nor
servility
,
``
I
have
taken
a
great
*NL*
liberty
in
coming
here
,
but
you
know
how
to
excuse
it
,
being
so
*NL*
amiable
,
mademoiselle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
excuse
is
necessary
,
''
I
returned
,
``
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
desire
,
mademoiselle
.
A
thousand
thanks
for
the
*NL*
permission
.
I
have
your
leave
to
speak
.
Is
it
not
?
''
she
said
in
a
*NL*
quick
,
natural
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
you
are
so
amiable
!
Listen
then
,
if
you
please
.
I
have
*NL*
left
my
Lady
.
We
could
not
agree
.
My
Lady
is
so
high
,
so
very
high
.
*NL*
Pardon
!
Mademoiselle
,
you
are
right
!
''
Her
quickness
anticipated
what
*NL*
I
might
have
said
presently
but
as
yet
had
only
thought
.
``
It
is
not
*NL*
for
me
to
come
here
to
complain
of
my
Lady
.
But
I
say
she
is
so
high
,
*NL*
so
very
high
.
I
will
not
say
a
word
more
.
All
the
world
knows
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
if
you
please
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
;
mademoiselle
,
I
am
thankful
for
your
politeness
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
,
I
have
an
inexpressible
desire
to
find
service
with
a
*NL*
young
lady
who
is
good
,
accomplished
,
beautiful
.
You
are
good

*NL*
accomplished

beautiful

Ah

I
have
the
honour
*NL*

domestic

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry

I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
dismiss
me
so
soon
,
mademoiselle
!
''
she
said
with
an
*NL*
involuntary
contraction
of
her
fine
black
eyebrows
.
``
Let
me
hope
a
*NL*
moment
!
Mademoiselle
,
I
know
this
service
would
be
more
retired
than
*NL*
that
which
I
have
quitted
.
Well
!
I
wish
that
.
I
know
this
service
*NL*
would
be
less
distinguished
than
that
which
I
have
quitted

Well
!
I
*NL*
wish
that
,
I
know
that
I
should
win
less
,
as
to
wages
here
.
Good
.
I
*NL*
am
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
''
said
I
,
quite
embarrassed
by
the
mere
idea
of
having
*NL*
such
an
attendant
,
``
that
I
keep
no
maid
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
mademoiselle
,

why
not

Why
not

you
can

one
so

devoted

you

Who
would

enchanted

serve
you

would
be
so

true

so
zealous

so
faithful

Mademoiselle

I
wish

Do
not
speak
of
money
at
present

Take
me
as
I
am

For
nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
singularly
earnest
that
I
drew
back
,
almost
afraid
of
her
.
*NL*
Without
appearing
to
notice
it
,
in
her
ardour
she
still
pressed
*NL*
herself
upon
me
,
speaking
in
a
rapid
subdued
voice
,
though
always
*NL*
with
a
certain
grace
and
propriety

Mademoiselle
,
I
come
from
the
South
country
where
we
are
quick
and
*NL*
where
we
like
and
dislike
very
strong
.
My
Lady
was
too
high
for
me
;
I
*NL*
was
too
high
for
her
.
It
is
done
--
past
--
finished
!
Receive
me
as
your
*NL*
domestic
,
and
I
will
serve
you
well
.
I
will
do
more
for
you
than
you
*NL*
figure
to
yourself
now
.
Chut
!
Mademoiselle
,
I
will
--
no
matter
,
I
will
*NL*
do
my
utmost
possible
in
all
things
.
If
you
accept
my
service
,
you
*NL*
will
not
repent
it
.
Mademoiselle
,
you
will
not
repent
it
,
and
I
will
*NL*
serve
you
well
.
You
do
n't
know
how
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
lowering
energy
in
her
face
as
she
stood
looking
at
me
*NL*
while
I
explained
the
impossibility
of
my
engaging
her
-LRB-
without
*NL*
thinking
it
necessary
to
say
how
very
little
I
desired
to
do
so
-RRB-
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
bring
visibly
before
me
some
woman
from
the
streets
*NL*
of
Paris
in
the
reign
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
me
out
without
interruption
and
then
said
with
her
pretty
*NL*
accent
and
in
her
mildest
voice
,
``
Hey
,
mademoiselle
,
I
have
received
*NL*
my
answer
!
I
am
sorry
of
it
.
But
I
must
go
elsewhere
and
seek
what
I
*NL*
have
not
found
here
.
Will
you
graciously
let
me
kiss
your
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
more
intently
as
she
took
it
,
and
seemed
to
take
*NL*
note
,
with
her
momentary
touch
,
of
every
vein
in
it
.
``
I
fear
I
*NL*
surprised
you
,
mademoiselle
,
on
the
day
of
the
storm
?
''
she
said
with
*NL*
a
parting
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confessed
that
she
had
surprised
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
an
oath
,
mademoiselle
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
,
``
and
I
wanted
to
*NL*
stamp
it
on
my
mind
so
that
I
might
keep
it
faithfully
.
And
I
will
!
*NL*
Adieu
,
mademoiselle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
our
conference
,
which
I
was
very
glad
to
bring
to
a
close
.
I
*NL*
supposed
she
went
away
from
the
village
,
for
I
saw
her
no
more
;
and
*NL*
nothing
else
occurred
to
disturb
our
tranquil
summer
pleasures
until
*NL*
six
weeks
were
out
and
we
returned
home
as
I
began
just
now
by
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
and
for
a
good
many
weeks
after
that
time
,
Richard
was
*NL*
constant
in
his
visits
.
Besides
coming
every
Saturday
or
Sunday
and
*NL*
remaining
with
us
until
Monday
morning
,
he
sometimes
rode
out
on
*NL*
horseback
unexpectedly
and
passed
the
evening
with
us
and
rode
back
*NL*
again
early
next
day
.
He
was
as
vivacious
as
ever
and
told
us
he
was
*NL*
very
industrious
,
but
I
was
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
him
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
me
that
his
industry
was
all
misdirected
.
I
could
not
*NL*
find
that
it
led
to
anything
but
the
formation
of
delusive
hopes
in
*NL*
connexion
with
the
suit
already
the
pernicious
cause
of
so
much
*NL*
sorrow
and
ruin
.
He
had
got
at
the
core
of
that
mystery
now
,
he
told
*NL*
us
,
and
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
that
the
will
under
which
he
*NL*
and
Ada
were
to
take
I
do
n't
know
how
many
thousands
of
pounds
must
*NL*
be
finally
established
if
there
were
any
sense
or
justice
in
the
*NL*
Court
of
Chancery
--
but
oh
,
what
a
great
IF
that
sounded
in
my
*NL*
ears
--
and
that
this
happy
conclusion
could
not
be
much
longer
*NL*
delayed
.
He
proved
this
to
himself
by
all
the
weary
arguments
on
that
*NL*
side
he
had
read
,
and
every
one
of
them
sunk
him
deeper
in
the
*NL*
infatuation
.
He
had
even
begun
to
haunt
the
court
.
He
told
us
how
he
*NL*
saw
Miss
Flite
there
daily
,
how
they
talked
together
,
and
how
he
did
*NL*
her
little
kindnesses
,
and
how
,
while
he
laughed
at
her
,
he
pitied
*NL*
her
from
his
heart
.
But
he
never
thought
--
never
,
my
poor
,
dear
,
*NL*
sanguine
Richard
,
capable
of
so
much
happiness
then
,
and
with
such
*NL*
better
things
before
him
--
what
a
fatal
link
was
riveting
between
his
*NL*
fresh
youth
and
her
faded
age
,
between
his
free
hopes
and
her
caged
*NL*
birds
,
and
her
hungry
garret
,
and
her
wandering
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
loved
him
too
well
to
mistrust
him
much
in
anything
he
said
or
*NL*
did
,
and
my
guardian
,
though
he
frequently
complained
of
the
east
*NL*
wind
and
read
more
than
usual
in
the
growlery
,
preserved
a
strict
*NL*
silence
on
the
subject
.
So
I
thought
one
day
when
I
went
to
London
to
*NL*
meet
Caddy
Jellyby
,
at
her
solicitation
,
I
would
ask
Richard
to
be
in
*NL*
waiting
for
me
at
the
coach-office
,
that
we
might
have
a
little
talk
*NL*
together
.
I
found
him
there
when
I
arrived
,
and
we
walked
away
arm
in
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Richard
,
''
said
I
as
soon
as
I
could
begin
to
be
grave
with
*NL*
him
,
``
are
you
beginning
to
feel
more
settled
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
my
dear
!
''
returned
Richard
.
``
I
'm
all
right
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
settled
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
settled
?
''
returned
Richard
with
his
gay
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Settled
in
the
law
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
aye
,
''
replied
Richard
,
``
I
'm
all
right
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
that
before
,
my
dear
Richard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
think
it
's
an
answer
,
eh
?
Well
!
Perhaps
it
's
not
.
*NL*
Settled
?
You
mean
,
do
I
feel
as
if
I
were
settling
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
I
ca
n't
say
I
am
settling
down
,
''
said
Richard
,
strongly
*NL*
emphasizing
``
down
,
''
as
if
that
expressed
the
difficulty
,
``
because
one
*NL*
ca
n't
settle
down
while
this
business
remains
in
such
an
unsettled
*NL*
state
.
When
I
say
this
business
,
of
course
I
mean
the
--
forbidden
*NL*
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
will
ever
be
in
a
settled
state
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
''
answered
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
a
little
way
without
speaking
,
and
presently
Richard
*NL*
addressed
me
in
his
frankest
and
most
feeling
manner
,
thus
:
``
My
dear
*NL*
Esther
,
I
understand
you
,
and
I
wish
to
heaven
I
were
a
more
constant
*NL*
sort
of
fellow
.
I
do
n't
mean
constant
to
Ada
,
for
I
love
her
*NL*
dearly
--
better
and
better
every
day
--
but
constant
to
myself
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Somehow
,
I
mean
something
that
I
ca
n't
very
well
express
,
but
you
'll
*NL*
make
it
out
.
-RRB-
If
I
were
a
more
constant
sort
of
fellow
,
I
should
have
*NL*
held
on
either
to
Badger
or
to
Kenge
and
Carboy
like
grim
death
,
and
*NL*
should
have
begun
to
be
steady
and
systematic
by
this
time
,
and
*NL*
should
n't
be
in
debt
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
ARE
you
in
debt
,
Richard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
I
am
a
little
so
,
my
dear
.
Also
,
I
have
taken
*NL*
rather
too
much
to
billiards
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
Now
the
murder
's
*NL*
out
;
you
despise
me
,
Esther
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
do
n't
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
kinder
to
me
than
I
often
am
to
myself
,
''
he
returned
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
Esther
,
I
am
a
very
unfortunate
dog
not
to
be
more
settled
,
but
*NL*
how
CAN
I
be
more
settled
?
If
you
lived
in
an
unfinished
house
,
you
*NL*
could
n't
settle
down
in
it
;
if
you
were
condemned
to
leave
everything
*NL*
you
undertook
unfinished
,
you
would
find
it
hard
to
apply
yourself
to
*NL*
anything
;
and
yet
that
's
my
unhappy
case
.
I
was
born
into
this
*NL*
unfinished
contention
with
all
its
chances
and
changes
,
and
it
began
*NL*
to
unsettle
me
before
I
quite
knew
the
difference
between
a
suit
at
*NL*
law
and
a
suit
of
clothes
;
and
it
has
gone
on
unsettling
me
ever
*NL*
since
;
and
here
I
am
now
,
conscious
sometimes
that
I
am
but
a
*NL*
worthless
fellow
to
love
my
confiding
cousin
Ada
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
in
a
solitary
place
,
and
he
put
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
*NL*
sobbed
as
he
said
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Richard
!
''
said
I.
``
Do
not
be
so
moved
.
You
have
a
noble
nature
,
*NL*
and
Ada
's
love
may
make
you
worthier
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
my
dear
,
''
he
replied
,
pressing
my
arm
,
``
I
know
all
that
.
You
*NL*
must
n't
mind
my
being
a
little
soft
now
,
for
I
have
had
all
this
upon
*NL*
my
mind
for
a
long
time
,
and
have
often
meant
to
speak
to
you
,
and
*NL*
have
sometimes
wanted
opportunity
and
sometimes
courage
.
I
know
what
*NL*
the
thought
of
Ada
ought
to
do
for
me
,
but
it
does
n't
do
it
.
I
am
too
*NL*
unsettled
even
for
that
.
I
love
her
most
devotedly
,
and
yet
I
do
her
*NL*
wrong
,
in
doing
myself
wrong
,
every
day
and
hour
.
But
it
ca
n't
last
*NL*
for
ever
.
We
shall
come
on
for
a
final
hearing
and
get
judgment
in
*NL*
our
favour
,
and
then
you
and
Ada
shall
see
what
I
can
really
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
given
me
a
pang
to
hear
him
sob
and
see
the
tears
start
out
*NL*
between
his
fingers
,
but
that
was
infinitely
less
affecting
to
me
*NL*
than
the
hopeful
animation
with
which
he
said
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
looked
well
into
the
papers
,
Esther
.
I
have
been
deep
in
them
*NL*
for
months
,
''
he
continued
,
recovering
his
cheerfulness
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
``
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
we
shall
come
out
triumphant
.
As
to
*NL*
years
of
delay
,
there
has
been
no
want
of
them
,
heaven
knows
!
And
*NL*
there
is
the
greater
probability
of
our
bringing
the
matter
to
a
*NL*
speedy
close
;
in
fact
,
it
's
on
the
paper
now
.
It
will
be
all
right
at
*NL*
last
,
and
then
you
shall
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Recalling
how
he
had
just
now
placed
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
in
the
*NL*
same
category
with
Mr.
Badger
,
I
asked
him
when
he
intended
to
be
*NL*
articled
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
again
!
I
think
not
at
all
,
Esther
,
''
he
returned
with
an
*NL*
effort
.
``
I
fancy
I
have
had
enough
of
it
.
Having
worked
at
Jarndyce
*NL*
and
Jarndyce
like
a
galley
slave
,
I
have
slaked
my
thirst
for
the
law
*NL*
and
satisfied
myself
that
I
should
n't
like
it
.
Besides
,
I
find
it
*NL*
unsettles
me
more
and
more
to
be
so
constantly
upon
the
scene
of
*NL*
action
.
So
what
,
''
continued
Richard
,
confident
again
by
this
time
,
*NL*
``
do
I
naturally
turn
my
thoughts
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
imagine
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
look
so
serious
,
''
returned
Richard
,
``
because
it
's
the
best
*NL*
thing
I
can
do
,
my
dear
Esther
,
I
am
certain
.
It
's
not
as
if
I
wanted
*NL*
a
profession
for
life
.
These
proceedings
will
come
to
a
termination
,
*NL*
and
then
I
am
provided
for
.
No
.
I
look
upon
it
as
a
pursuit
which
is
*NL*
in
its
nature
more
or
less
unsettled
,
and
therefore
suited
to
my
*NL*
temporary
condition
--
I
may
say
,
precisely
suited
.
What
is
it
that
I
*NL*
naturally
turn
my
thoughts
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
and
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
said
Richard
,
in
a
tone
of
perfect
conviction
,
``
but
the
*NL*
army
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
army
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
army
,
of
course
.
What
I
have
to
do
is
to
get
a
commission
;
*NL*
and
--
there
I
am
,
you
know
!
''
said
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
showed
me
,
proved
by
elaborate
calculations
in
his
*NL*
pocket-book
,
that
supposing
he
had
contracted
,
say
,
two
hundred
*NL*
pounds
of
debt
in
six
months
out
of
the
army
;
and
that
he
contracted
*NL*
no
debt
at
all
within
a
corresponding
period
in
the
army
--
as
to
which
*NL*
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
;
this
step
must
involve
a
saving
of
*NL*
four
hundred
pounds
in
a
year
,
or
two
thousand
pounds
in
five
years
,
*NL*
which
was
a
considerable
sum
.
And
then
he
spoke
so
ingenuously
and
*NL*
sincerely
of
the
sacrifice
he
made
in
withdrawing
himself
for
a
time
*NL*
from
Ada
,
and
of
the
earnestness
with
which
he
aspired
--
as
in
thought
*NL*
he
always
did
,
I
know
full
well
--
to
repay
her
love
,
and
to
ensure
her
*NL*
happiness
,
and
to
conquer
what
was
amiss
in
himself
,
and
to
acquire
*NL*
the
very
soul
of
decision
,
that
he
made
my
heart
ache
keenly
,
sorely
.
*NL*
For
,
I
thought
,
how
would
this
end
,
how
could
this
end
,
when
so
soon
*NL*
and
so
surely
all
his
manly
qualities
were
touched
by
the
fatal
*NL*
blight
that
ruined
everything
it
rested
on
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
spoke
to
Richard
with
all
the
earnestness
I
felt
,
and
all
the
hope
*NL*
I
could
not
quite
feel
then
,
and
implored
him
for
Ada
's
sake
not
to
*NL*
put
any
trust
in
Chancery
.
To
all
I
said
,
Richard
readily
assented
,
*NL*
riding
over
the
court
and
everything
else
in
his
easy
way
and
drawing
*NL*
the
brightest
pictures
of
the
character
he
was
to
settle
into
--
alas
,
*NL*
when
the
grievous
suit
should
loose
its
hold
upon
him
!
We
had
a
long
*NL*
talk
,
but
it
always
came
back
to
that
,
in
substance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
came
to
Soho
Square
,
where
Caddy
Jellyby
had
appointed
to
*NL*
wait
for
me
,
as
a
quiet
place
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Newman
Street
.
*NL*
Caddy
was
in
the
garden
in
the
centre
and
hurried
out
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
appeared
.
After
a
few
cheerful
words
,
Richard
left
us
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
has
a
pupil
over
the
way
,
Esther
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
and
got
the
*NL*
key
for
us
.
So
if
you
will
walk
round
and
round
here
with
me
,
we
can
*NL*
lock
ourselves
in
and
I
can
tell
you
comfortably
what
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
your
dear
good
face
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I.
``
Nothing
could
be
better
.
''
So
Caddy
,
*NL*
after
affectionately
squeezing
the
dear
good
face
as
she
called
it
,
*NL*
locked
the
gate
,
and
took
my
arm
,
and
we
began
to
walk
round
the
*NL*
garden
very
cosily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Esther
,
''
said
Caddy
,
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
little
*NL*
confidence
,
``
after
you
spoke
to
me
about
its
being
wrong
to
marry
*NL*
without
Ma
's
knowledge
,
or
even
to
keep
Ma
long
in
the
dark
*NL*
respecting
our
engagement
--
though
I
do
n't
believe
Ma
cares
much
for
*NL*
me
,
I
must
say
--
I
thought
it
right
to
mention
your
opinions
to
*NL*
Prince
.
In
the
first
place
because
I
want
to
profit
by
everything
you
*NL*
tell
me
,
and
in
the
second
place
because
I
have
no
secrets
from
*NL*
Prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
approved
,
Caddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
!
I
assure
you
he
would
approve
of
anything
you
could
*NL*
say
.
You
have
no
idea
what
an
opinion
he
has
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
it
's
enough
to
make
anybody
but
me
jealous
,
''
said
Caddy
,
*NL*
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
;
``
but
it
only
makes
me
joyful
,
for
you
*NL*
are
the
first
friend
I
ever
had
,
and
the
best
friend
I
ever
can
have
,
*NL*
and
nobody
can
respect
and
love
you
too
much
to
please
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
Caddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
are
in
the
general
conspiracy
to
*NL*
keep
me
in
a
good
humour
.
Well
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
I
am
going
to
tell
you
,
''
replied
Caddy
,
crossing
her
hands
*NL*
confidentially
upon
my
arm
.
``
So
we
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
,
and
*NL*
so
I
said
to
Prince
,
`
Prince
,
as
Miss
Summerson
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
did
n't
say
`
Miss
Summerson
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
did
n't
!
''
cried
Caddy
,
greatly
pleased
and
with
the
brightest
*NL*
of
faces
.
``
I
said
,
`
Esther
.
'
I
said
to
Prince
,
`
As
Esther
is
*NL*
decidedly
of
that
opinion
,
Prince
,
and
has
expressed
it
to
me
,
and
*NL*
always
hints
it
when
she
writes
those
kind
notes
,
which
you
are
so
*NL*
fond
of
hearing
me
read
to
you
,
I
am
prepared
to
disclose
the
truth
*NL*
to
Ma
whenever
you
think
proper
.
And
I
think
,
Prince
,
'
said
I
,
`
that
*NL*
Esther
thinks
that
I
should
be
in
a
better
,
and
truer
,
and
more
*NL*
honourable
position
altogether
if
you
did
the
same
to
your
papa
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I.
``
Esther
certainly
does
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
was
right
,
you
see
!
''
exclaimed
Caddy
.
``
Well
!
This
troubled
*NL*
Prince
a
good
deal
,
not
because
he
had
the
least
doubt
about
it
,
but
*NL*
because
he
is
so
considerate
of
the
feelings
of
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
;
*NL*
and
he
had
his
apprehensions
that
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
might
break
his
*NL*
heart
,
or
faint
away
,
or
be
very
much
overcome
in
some
affecting
*NL*
manner
or
other
if
he
made
such
an
announcement
.
He
feared
old
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
might
consider
it
undutiful
and
might
receive
too
great
a
*NL*
shock
.
For
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
deportment
is
very
beautiful
,
you
*NL*
know
,
Esther
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
and
his
feelings
are
extremely
*NL*
sensitive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
extremely
sensitive
.
Prince
says
so
.
Now
,
this
has
caused
my
*NL*
darling
child
--
I
did
n't
mean
to
use
the
expression
to
you
,
Esther
,
''
*NL*
Caddy
apologized
,
her
face
suffused
with
blushes
,
``
but
I
generally
*NL*
call
Prince
my
darling
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughed
;
and
Caddy
laughed
and
blushed
,
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
has
caused
him
,
Esther
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caused
whom
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
tiresome
thing
!
''
said
Caddy
,
laughing
,
with
her
pretty
face
*NL*
on
fire
.
``
My
darling
child
,
if
you
insist
upon
it
!
This
has
caused
*NL*
him
weeks
of
uneasiness
and
has
made
him
delay
,
from
day
to
day
,
in
a
*NL*
very
anxious
manner
.
At
last
he
said
to
me
,
`
Caddy
,
if
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
who
is
a
great
favourite
with
my
father
,
could
be
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
be
present
when
I
broke
the
subject
,
I
think
I
*NL*
could
do
it
.
'
So
I
promised
I
would
ask
you
.
And
I
made
up
my
mind
,
*NL*
besides
,
''
said
Caddy
,
looking
at
me
hopefully
but
timidly
,
``
that
if
*NL*
you
consented
,
I
would
ask
you
afterwards
to
come
with
me
to
Ma
.
This
*NL*
is
what
I
meant
when
I
said
in
my
note
that
I
had
a
great
favour
and
*NL*
a
great
assistance
to
beg
of
you
.
And
if
you
thought
you
could
grant
*NL*
it
,
Esther
,
we
should
both
be
very
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
Caddy
,
''
said
I
,
pretending
to
consider
.
``
Really
,
I
think
*NL*
I
could
do
a
greater
thing
than
that
if
the
need
were
pressing
.
I
am
*NL*
at
your
service
and
the
darling
child
's
,
my
dear
,
whenever
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
was
quite
transported
by
this
reply
of
mine
,
being
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
as
susceptible
to
the
least
kindness
or
encouragement
as
any
tender
*NL*
heart
that
ever
beat
in
this
world
;
and
after
another
turn
or
two
*NL*
round
the
garden
,
during
which
she
put
on
an
entirely
new
pair
of
*NL*
gloves
and
made
herself
as
resplendent
as
possible
that
she
might
do
*NL*
no
avoidable
discredit
to
the
Master
of
Deportment
,
we
went
to
Newman
*NL*
Street
direct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
was
teaching
,
of
course
.
We
found
him
engaged
with
a
not
very
*NL*
hopeful
pupil
--
a
stubborn
little
girl
with
a
sulky
forehead
,
a
deep
*NL*
voice
,
and
an
inanimate
,
dissatisfied
mama
--
whose
case
was
certainly
*NL*
not
rendered
more
hopeful
by
the
confusion
into
which
we
threw
her
*NL*
preceptor
.
The
lesson
at
last
came
to
an
end
,
after
proceeding
as
*NL*
discordantly
as
possible
;
and
when
the
little
girl
had
changed
her
*NL*
shoes
and
had
had
her
white
muslin
extinguished
in
shawls
,
she
was
*NL*
taken
away
.
After
a
few
words
of
preparation
,
we
then
went
in
search
*NL*
of
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
whom
we
found
,
grouped
with
his
hat
and
gloves
,
as
*NL*
a
model
of
deportment
,
on
the
sofa
in
his
private
apartment
--
the
only
*NL*
comfortable
room
in
the
house
.
He
appeared
to
have
dressed
at
his
*NL*
leisure
in
the
intervals
of
a
light
collation
,
and
his
dressing-case
,
*NL*
brushes
,
and
so
forth
,
all
of
quite
an
elegant
kind
,
lay
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
Miss
Summerson
;
Miss
Jellyby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charmed
!
Enchanted
!
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
rising
with
his
*NL*
high-shouldered
bow
.
``
Permit
me
!
''
Handing
chairs
.
``
Be
seated
!
''
*NL*
Kissing
the
tips
of
his
left
fingers
.
``
Overjoyed
!
''
Shutting
his
eyes
*NL*
and
rolling
.
``
My
little
retreat
is
made
a
paradise
.
''
Recomposing
*NL*
himself
on
the
sofa
like
the
second
gentleman
in
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
you
find
us
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
he
,
``
using
our
little
arts
*NL*
to
polish
,
polish
!
Again
the
sex
stimulates
us
and
rewards
us
by
the
*NL*
condescension
of
its
lovely
presence
.
It
is
much
in
these
times
-LRB-
and
*NL*
we
have
made
an
awfully
degenerating
business
of
it
since
the
days
of
*NL*
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
Regent
--
my
patron
,
if
I
may
presume
to
*NL*
say
so
-RRB-
to
experience
that
deportment
is
not
wholly
trodden
under
*NL*
foot
by
mechanics
.
That
it
can
yet
bask
in
the
smile
of
beauty
,
my
*NL*
dear
madam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
nothing
,
which
I
thought
a
suitable
reply
;
and
he
took
a
pinch
*NL*
of
snuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
son
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
you
have
four
schools
this
*NL*
afternoon
.
I
would
recommend
a
hasty
sandwich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

returned
Prince
,
``
I
will
be
sure
to
be
punctual

*NL*
My

I
beg
you

prepare
your
mind
for
what
I
am
*NL*
going
to
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heaven
!
''
exclaimed
the
model
,
pale
and
aghast
as
Prince
and
*NL*
Caddy
,
hand
in
hand
,
bent
down
before
him
.
``
What
is
this
?
Is
this
*NL*
lunacy

Or
what
is
this

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Prince
with
great
submission
,
``
I
love

young
*NL*
lady

are
engaged

*NL*
*NL*
``
Engaged

cried
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
reclining
on
the
sofa
and
shutting
*NL*
out
the
sight
with
his
hand
.
``
An
arrow
launched
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

faltered
Prince

Miss

hearing

advised

Mr.

underwent
a
severe
internal
struggle

came
upright

on
the
sofa
again
with
his
cheeks
puffing
over
his
stiff
cravat

a

perfect
model

His

out
his

said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
paternally
encircling
Caddy
with
*NL*
his
left
arm
as
she
sat
beside
him
,
and
putting
his
right
hand
*NL*
gracefully
on
his
hip
.
``
My
son
and
daughter

your
happiness
shall
be
*NL*
my
care

I
will
watch
over
you

You

always
live
with

--
meaning
,
of
course
,
I
will
always
live
with
you
--
``
this
house
is
*NL*
henceforth
as
much
yours
as
mine

consider
it
your

you
long

live
to
share
it
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
power
of
his
deportment
was
such
that
they
really
were
as
much
*NL*
overcome
with
thankfulness
as
if
,
instead
of
quartering
himself
upon
*NL*
them
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
he
were
making
some
munificent
*NL*
sacrifice
in
their
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
myself
,
my
children
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
I
am
falling
into
*NL*
the
sear
and
yellow
leaf
,
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
long
the
*NL*
last
feeble
traces
of
gentlemanly
deportment
may
linger
in
this
*NL*
weaving
and
spinning
age
.
But
,
so
long
,
I
will
do
my
duty
to
society
*NL*
and
will
show
myself
,
as
usual
,
about
town
.
My
wants
are
few
and
*NL*
simple
.
My
little
apartment
here
,
my
few
essentials
for
the
toilet
,
*NL*
my
frugal
morning
meal
,
and
my
little
dinner
will
suffice
.
I
charge
*NL*
your
dutiful
affection
with
the
supply
of
these
requirements
,
and
I
*NL*
charge
myself
with
all
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
overpowered
afresh
by
his
uncommon
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
for
those
little
points
in
which
you
*NL*
are
deficient
--
points
of
deportment
,
which
are
born
with
a
man
,
which
*NL*
may
be
improved
by
cultivation
,
but
can
never
be
originated
--
you
may
*NL*
still
rely
on
me
.
I
have
been
faithful
to
my
post
since
the
days
of
*NL*
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
Regent
,
and
I
will
not
desert
it
now
.
*NL*
No
,
my
son

If
you
have
ever
contemplated
your
father
's
poor
position
*NL*
with
a
feeling
of
pride
,
you
may
rest
assured
that
he
will
do
nothing
*NL*
to
tarnish
it
.
For
yourself
,
Prince
,
whose
character
is
different
-LRB-
we
*NL*
can
not
be
all
alike
,
nor
is
it
advisable
that
we
should
-RRB-
,
work

be
*NL*
industrious

earn
money

extend
the
connexion
as
much
as
*NL*
possible

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
may
depend
I
will
do

*NL*

Prince

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
of
it

said
Mr.
Turveydrop
.
``
Your
qualities
are
not

shining

they
are
steady

And
to
both
*NL*
of
you

I
would
merely
observe
,
in
the
spirit
of
a
*NL*
sainted
wooman
on

path
I
had
the
happiness
of
casting
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
SOME
ray
of

,
take
care
of
the
establishment
,
take
care
*NL*
of
my
simple
wants
,
and
bless
you
both

''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Turveydrop
then
became
so
very
gallant
,
in
honour
of
the
*NL*
occasion
,
that
I
told
Caddy
we
must
really
go
to
Thavies
Inn
at
once
*NL*
if
we
were
to
go
at
all
that
day
.
So
we
took
our
departure
after
a
*NL*
very
loving
farewell
between
Caddy
and
her
betrothed
,
and
during
our
*NL*
walk
she
was
so
happy
and
so
full
of
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
praises
*NL*
that
I
would
not
have
said
a
word
in
his
disparagement
for
any
*NL*
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
in
Thavies
Inn
had
bills
in
the
windows
announcing
that
it
*NL*
was
to
let
,
and
it
looked
dirtier
and
gloomier
and
ghastlier
than
*NL*
ever
.
The
name
of
poor
Mr.
Jellyby
had
appeared
in
the
list
of
*NL*
bankrupts
but
a
day
or
two
before
,
and
he
was
shut
up
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
with
two
gentlemen
and
a
heap
of
blue
bags
,
*NL*
account-books
,
and
papers
,
making
the
most
desperate
endeavours
to
*NL*
understand
his
affairs
.
They
appeared
to
me
to
be
quite
beyond
his
*NL*
comprehension
,
for
when
Caddy
took
me
into
the
dining-room
by
mistake
*NL*
and
we
came
upon
Mr.
Jellyby
in
his
spectacles
,
forlornly
fenced
into
*NL*
a
corner
by
the
great
dining-table
and
the
two
gentlemen
,
he
seemed
*NL*
to
have
given
up
the
whole
thing
and
to
be
speechless
and
insensible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
upstairs
to
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
room
-LRB-
the
children
were
all
*NL*
screaming
in
the
kitchen
,
and
there
was
no
servant
to
be
seen
-RRB-
,
we
*NL*
found
that
lady
in
the
midst
of
a
voluminous
correspondence
,
opening
,
*NL*
reading
,
and
sorting
letters
,
with
a
great
accumulation
of
torn
*NL*
covers
on
the
floor
.
She
was
so
preoccupied
that
at
first
she
did
not
*NL*
know
me
,
though
she
sat
looking
at
me
with
that
curious
,
bright-eyed
,
*NL*
far-off
look
of
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Miss
Summerson
!
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
I
was
thinking
of
something
*NL*
so
different
!
I
hope
you
are
well
.
I
am
happy
to
see
you
.
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Miss
Clare
quite
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hoped
in
return
that
Mr.
Jellyby
was
quite
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
not
quite
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
in
the
calmest
manner
.
*NL*
``
He
has
been
unfortunate
in
his
affairs
and
is
a
little
out
of
*NL*
spirits
.
Happily
for
me
,
I
am
so
much
engaged
that
I
have
no
time
to
*NL*
think
about
it
.
We
have
,
at
the
present
moment
,
one
hundred
and
*NL*
seventy
families
,
Miss
Summerson
,
averaging
five
persons
in
each
,
*NL*
either
gone
or
going
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Niger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
the
one
family
so
near
us
who
were
neither
gone
nor
*NL*
going
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Niger
,
and
wondered
how
she
could
be
so
*NL*
placid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
brought
Caddy
back
,
I
see
,
''
observed
Mrs.
Jellyby
with
a
*NL*
glance
at
her
daughter
.
``
It
has
become
quite
a
novelty
to
see
her
*NL*
here
.
She
has
almost
deserted
her
old
employment
and
in
fact
obliges
*NL*
me
to
employ
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
Ma
--
''
began
Caddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
know
,
Caddy
,
''
her
mother
mildly
interposed
,
``
that
I
DO
*NL*
employ
a
boy
,
who
is
now
at
his
dinner

What
is
the
use
of
your
*NL*
contradicting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
going
to
contradict
,
Ma
,
''
returned
Caddy
.
``
I
was
only
*NL*
going
to
say
that
surely
you
would
n't
have
me
be
a
mere
drudge
all
my
*NL*
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
my
dear

''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
still
opening
her
letters
,
*NL*
casting
her
bright
eyes
smilingly
over
them
,
and
sorting
them
as
she
*NL*
spoke
,
``
that
you
have
a
business
example
before
you
in
your

*NL*
Besides

A
mere
drudge

If
you
had
any
sympathy
with
the
destinies
of
*NL*
the
human
race
,
it
would
raise
you
high
above
any
such
idea
.
But
you
*NL*
have
none

I
have
often
told
you
,
Caddy
,
you
have
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

I
have
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

Now

not
happily
so
much
engaged

said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
sweetly
casting
her
eyes
for
a
*NL*
moment
on
me
and
considering
where
to
put
the
particular
letter
she
*NL*
had
just
opened
,
``
this
would
distress
and
disappoint
me

But
I
have
*NL*
so
much
to

of

in

and
it
is
so
*NL*
necessary
I
should
concentrate
myself
that
there
is
my
remedy

you
*NL*
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Caddy
gave
me
a
glance
of
entreaty
,
and
as
Mrs.
Jellyby
was
*NL*
looking
far
away
into
Africa
straight
through
my
bonnet
and
head
,
I
*NL*
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
come
to
the
subject
of
my
visit
and
*NL*
to
attract
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
I
began
,
``
you
will
wonder
what
has
brought
me
here
to
*NL*
interrupt
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
always
delighted
to
see

said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
*NL*
pursuing
her
employment
with
a
placid
smile
.
``
Though
I
wish

and
she
*NL*
shook
her
head
,
``
she
was
more
interested

Borrioboolan
*NL*
project
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
with
Caddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
because

justly
thinks

encourage

*NL*
*NL*
``
Caddy

said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
pausing
for
a
moment
in
her
occupation
*NL*
and
then
serenely
pursuing
it
after
shaking
her
head
,
``
you
are
going
*NL*
to
tell
me
some
nonsense

''
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
untied
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
,
took
her
bonnet
off
,
and
*NL*
letting
it
dangle
on
the
floor
by
the
strings
,
and
crying
heartily
,
*NL*
said
,
``

*NL*
``

observed
Mrs.

with
an
abstracted

air

she
looked
over
the
dispatch

opened

are

*NL*
*NL*
``

sobbed
Caddy
,
quite
forgetful
of
her
general
complainings
and
*NL*
of
everything
but
her
natural
affection

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

observed
Mrs.

serenely

it

much
occupied

I
have

Here
is
Caddy

engaged

mixed
up
with
people
who
have
no

more
sympathy

destinies

This

too
,
when
Mr.

one
of
the
first
philanthropists
*NL*
of
our

has
mentioned
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Mrs.

opening
another
letter
with
*NL*
the
greatest
complacency

``
I
have
no

you
did

How
could
you

totally
destitute

Now

petty
details
might
grieve
me
very
much

can
I
*NL*
permit
the
film
of
a
silly
proceeding
on
the
part

from
whom

I
expect
nothing

to
interpose
between

continent

No

No

repeated
Mrs.
Jellyby
in
a
calm
clear
voice

and
*NL*
with
an
agreeable
smile
,
as
she
opened
more
letters
and
sorted
them
.
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
unprepared

this
reception

though
I
might
have
expected
it
,
that
I
did
not
know
what
to
say

*NL*
Caddy
seemed
equally
at
a
loss
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
continued
to
open
and
*NL*
sort
letters
and
to
repeat
occasionally
in
quite
a
charming
tone
of
*NL*
voice

with
a
smile
of
perfect
composure

``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``

poor
Caddy
at

``
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Caddy
,
you
really
are
an
absurd
girl

returned
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
*NL*
``
to
ask
such
questions

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
nonsensical

Mrs.

is
taken

Mrs.

Caddy
was
kissing
her
,

do

*NL*
I
thought
I
could
not

better

take
my

relapsed
into

distant
contemplation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Caddy
,
Caddy
!
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
quite
weary
of
such
little
*NL*
matters
.
``
Then
you
must
bring
him
some
evening
which
is
not
a
Parent
*NL*
Society
night
,
or
a
Branch
night
,
or
a
Ramification
night
.
You
must
*NL*
accommodate
the
visit
to
the
demands
upon
my
time
.
My
dear
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
here
to
help
out
this
*NL*
silly
chit
.
Good-bye
!
When
I
tell
you
that
I
have
fifty-eight
new
*NL*
letters
from
manufacturing
families
anxious
to
understand
the
details
*NL*
of
the
native
and
coffee-cultivation
question
this
morning
,
I
need
*NL*
not
apologize
for
having
very
little
leisure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
surprised
by
Caddy
's
being
in
low
spirits
when
we
went
*NL*
downstairs
,
or
by
her
sobbing
afresh
on
my
neck
,
or
by
her
saying
she
*NL*
would
far
rather
have
been
scolded
than
treated
with
such
*NL*
indifference
,
or
by
her
confiding
to
me
that
she
was
so
poor
in
*NL*
clothes
that
how
she
was
ever
to
be
married
creditably
she
did
n't
*NL*
know
.
I
gradually
cheered
her
up
by
dwelling
on
the
many
things
she
*NL*
would
do
for
her
unfortunate
father
and
for
Peepy
when
she
had
a
home
*NL*
of
her
own
;
and
finally
we
went
downstairs
into
the
damp
dark
*NL*
kitchen
,
where
Peepy
and
his
little
brothers
and
sisters
were
*NL*
grovelling
on
the
stone
floor
and
where
we
had
such
a
game
of
play
*NL*
with
them
that
to
prevent
myself
from
being
quite
torn
to
pieces
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
fall
back
on
my
fairy-tales
.
From
time
to
time
I
heard
*NL*
loud
voices
in
the
parlour
overhead
,
and
occasionally
a
violent
*NL*
tumbling
about
of
the
furniture
.
The
last
effect
I
am
afraid
was
*NL*
caused
by
poor
Mr.
Jellyby
's
breaking
away
from
the
dining-table
and
*NL*
making
rushes
at
the
window
with
the
intention
of
throwing
himself
*NL*
into
the
area
whenever
he
made
any
new
attempt
to
understand
his
*NL*
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
rode
quietly
home
at
night
after
the
day
's
bustle
,
I
thought
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
Caddy
's
engagement
and
felt
confirmed
in
my
hopes
-LRB-
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
elder
Mr.
Turveydrop
-RRB-
that
she
would
be
the
happier
and
*NL*
better
for
it
.
And
if
there
seemed
to
be
but
a
slender
chance
of
her
*NL*
and
her
husband
ever
finding
out
what
the
model
of
deportment
really
*NL*
was
,
why
that
was
all
for
the
best
too
,
and
who
would
wish
them
to
be
*NL*
wiser
?
I
did
not
wish
them
to
be
any
wiser
and
indeed
was
half
*NL*
ashamed
of
not
entirely
believing
in
him
myself
.
And
I
looked
up
at
*NL*
the
stars
,
and
thought
about
travellers
in
distant
countries
and
the
*NL*
stars
THEY
saw
,
and
hoped
I
might
always
be
so
blest
and
happy
as
to
*NL*
be
useful
to
some
one
in
my
small
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
so
glad
to
see
me
when
I
got
home
,
as
they
always
were
,
*NL*
that
I
could
have
sat
down
and
cried
for
joy
if
that
had
not
been
a
*NL*
method
of
making
myself
disagreeable
.
Everybody
in
the
house
,
from
*NL*
the
lowest
to
the
highest
,
showed
me
such
a
bright
face
of
welcome
,
*NL*
and
spoke
so
cheerily
,
and
was
so
happy
to
do
anything
for
me
,
that
I
*NL*
suppose
there
never
was
such
a
fortunate
little
creature
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
into
such
a
chatty
state
that
night
,
through
Ada
and
my
*NL*
guardian
drawing
me
out
to
tell
them
all
about
Caddy
,
that
I
went
on
*NL*
prose
,
prose
,
prosing
for
a
length
of
time
.
At
last
I
got
up
to
my
*NL*
own
room
,
quite
red
to
think
how
I
had
been
holding
forth
,
and
then
I
*NL*
heard
a
soft
tap
at
my
door
.
So
I
said
,
``
Come
in
!
''
and
there
came
in
*NL*
a
pretty
little
girl
,
neatly
dressed
in
mourning
,
who
dropped
a
*NL*
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
miss
,
''
said
the
little
girl
in
a
soft
voice
,
``
I
am
*NL*
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
so
you
are
,
''
said
I
,
stooping
down
in
astonishment
and
giving
*NL*
her
a
kiss
.
``
How
glad
am
I
to
see
you
,
Charley
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
miss
,
''
pursued
Charley
in
the
same
soft
voice
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
your
maid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

I
'm

Mr.
Jarndyce
's

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
with
my
hand
on
Charley
's
neck
and
looked
at
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
oh
,
miss

''
says
Charley
,
clapping
her
hands
,
with
the
tears
*NL*
starting
down
her
dimpled
cheeks
,
``
Tom
's
at
school

that
Tom

me
had
better
get
a
little
used

parting

first

was

with

Charley
dried

entered
on

going
in

matronly
little

about

about

folding
up

everything

lay

Presently
Charley
came

creeping
back

so

I

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
An
Appeal
Case
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Richard
and
I
had
held
the
conversation
of
which
I
have
*NL*
given
an
account
,
Richard
communicated
the
state
of
his
mind
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
I
doubt
if
my
guardian
were
altogether
taken
by
surprise
*NL*
when
he
received
the
representation
,
though
it
caused
him
much
*NL*
uneasiness
and
disappointment
.
He
and
Richard
were
often
closeted
*NL*
together
,
late
at
night
and
early
in
the
morning
,
and
passed
whole
*NL*
days
in
London
,
and
had
innumerable
appointments
with
Mr.
Kenge
,
and
*NL*
laboured
through
a
quantity
of
disagreeable
business
.
While
they
were
*NL*
thus
employed
,
my
guardian
,
though
he
underwent
considerable
*NL*
inconvenience
from
the
state
of
the
wind
and
rubbed
his
head
so
*NL*
constantly
that
not
a
single
hair
upon
it
ever
rested
in
its
right
*NL*
place
,
was
as
genial
with
Ada
and
me
as
at
any
other
time
,
but
*NL*
maintained
a
steady
reserve
on
these
matters
.
And
as
our
utmost
*NL*
endeavours
could
only
elicit
from
Richard
himself
sweeping
assurances
*NL*
that
everything
was
going
on
capitally
and
that
it
really
was
all
*NL*
right
at
last
,
our
anxiety
was
not
much
relieved
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
learnt
,
however
,
as
the
time
went
on
,
that
a
new
application
was
*NL*
made
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
on
Richard
's
behalf
as
an
infant
and
a
*NL*
ward
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
,
and
that
there
was
a
quantity
of
*NL*
talking
,
and
that
the
Lord
Chancellor
described
him
in
open
court
as
*NL*
a
vexatious
and
capricious
infant
,
and
that
the
matter
was
adjourned
*NL*
and
readjourned
,
and
referred
,
and
reported
on
,
and
petitioned
about
*NL*
until
Richard
began
to
doubt
-LRB-
as
he
told
us
-RRB-
whether
,
if
he
entered
*NL*
the
army
at
all
,
it
would
not
be
as
a
veteran
of
seventy
or
eighty
*NL*
years
of
age
.
At
last
an
appointment
was
made
for
him
to
see
the
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
again
in
his
private
room
,
and
there
the
Lord
Chancellor
*NL*
very
seriously
reproved
him
for
trifling
with
time
and
not
knowing
*NL*
his
mind
--
``
a
pretty
good
joke
,
I
think
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
from
that
*NL*
quarter
!
''
--
and
at
last
it
was
settled
that
his
application
should
be
*NL*
granted
.
His
name
was
entered
at
the
Horse
Guards
as
an
applicant
for
*NL*
an
ensign
's
commission
;
the
purchase-money
was
deposited
at
an
*NL*
agent
's
;
and
Richard
,
in
his
usual
characteristic
way
,
plunged
into
a
*NL*
violent
course
of
military
study
and
got
up
at
five
o'clock
every
*NL*
morning
to
practise
the
broadsword
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
vacation
succeeded
term
,
and
term
succeeded
vacation
.
We
*NL*
sometimes
heard
of
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
as
being
in
the
paper
or
out
*NL*
of
the
paper
,
or
as
being
to
be
mentioned
,
or
as
being
to
be
spoken
*NL*
to
;
and
it
came
on
,
and
it
went
off
.
Richard
,
who
was
now
in
a
*NL*
professor
's
house
in
London
,
was
able
to
be
with
us
less
frequently
*NL*
than
before
;
my
guardian
still
maintained
the
same
reserve
;
and
so
*NL*
time
passed
until
the
commission
was
obtained
and
Richard
received
*NL*
directions
with
it
to
join
a
regiment
in
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
arrived
post-haste
with
the
intelligence
one
evening
,
and
had
a
*NL*
long
conference
with
my
guardian
.
Upwards
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
*NL*
my
guardian
put
his
head
into
the
room
where
Ada
and
I
were
sitting
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Come
in
,
my
dears
!
''
We
went
in
and
found
Richard
,
whom
we
*NL*
had
last
seen
in
high
spirits
,
leaning
on
the
chimney-piece
looking
*NL*
mortified
and
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rick
and
I
,
Ada
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
are
not
quite
of
one
mind
.
*NL*
Come
,
come
,
Rick
,
put
a
brighter
face
upon
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
hard
with
me
,
sir
,
''
said
Richard
.
``
The
harder
because
*NL*
you
have
been
so
considerate
to
me
in
all
other
respects
and
have
*NL*
done
me
kindnesses
that
I
can
never
acknowledge
.
I
never
could
have
*NL*
been
set
right
without
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
``
I
want
to
set
you
more
right
yet
.
I
*NL*
want
to
set
you
more
right
with
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
saying
,
sir
,
''
returned
Richard
in
a
fiery
*NL*
way
,
but
yet
respectfully
,
``
that
I
think
I
am
the
best
judge
about
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
saying
,
my
dear
Rick
,
''
observed
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
with
the
sweetest
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
,
``
that
it
's
*NL*
quite
natural
in
you
to
think
so
,
but
I
do
n't
think
so
.
I
must
do
my
*NL*
duty
,
Rick
,
or
you
could
never
care
for
me
in
cool
blood
;
and
I
hope
*NL*
you
will
always
care
for
me
,
cool
and
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
had
turned
so
pale
that
he
made
her
sit
down
in
his
reading-chair
*NL*
and
sat
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
's
nothing
.
Rick
and
I
have
only
*NL*
had
a
friendly
difference

which
we
must
state
to
you
,
for
you
are
*NL*
the
theme

Now

afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Ada
with
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

putting
his
hand
on
hers
as
it
lay
on
the
side
of
the
*NL*
easy-chair
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
can
never

it

said
Ada

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much

returned
my
guardian
,
his
face
irradiated
by
the
*NL*
gentleness
and
honour
of
his
heart
.
``
Ada

my
bird

you
should
know

All
that

he
has
of
certainty
will
be
expended
when
he
is
fully
equipped

has
exhausted

bound
henceforward

planted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
true
that
I
have
exhausted
my

I
am
*NL*
quite
content

what
I
have
of
certainty

said
*NL*
Richard
,
``
is
not
all
I
have

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rick

Rick
!
''
cried
my
guardian
with
a
sudden
terror
in
his
manner
,
*NL*
and
in
an
altered
voice
,
and
putting
up
his
hands
as
if
he
would
have
*NL*
stopped
his
ears
.
``
For
the
love
of
God
,
do
n't
found
a
hope
or
*NL*
expectation
on
the
family
curse
!
Whatever
you
do
on
this
side
the
*NL*
grave
,
never
give
one
lingering
glance
towards
the
horrible
phantom
*NL*
that
has
haunted
us
so
many
years
.
Better
to
borrow
,
better
to
beg
,
*NL*
better
to
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
startled
by
the
fervour
of
this
warning
.
Richard
bit
his
*NL*
lip
and
held
his
breath
,
and
glanced
at
me
as
if
he
felt
,
and
knew
*NL*
that
I
felt
too
,
how
much
he
needed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ada
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
recovering
his
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
``
these
are
strong
words
of
advice
,
but
I
live
in
Bleak
House

have
*NL*
seen
a
sight
here
.
Enough
of
that
.
All
Richard
had
to
start
him
in
*NL*
the
race
of
life
is
ventured
.
I
recommend
to
him
and
you
,
for
his
*NL*
sake
and
your
own
,
that
he
should
depart
from
us
with
the
*NL*
understanding
that
there
is
no

I
must
*NL*
go
further

I
will
be
plain
with

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
to

at

Richard

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*

You

Mr.

*NL*

Why

returned
Richard
hastily
.
``
It

not

Mr.

kindly

*NL*
*NL*
Richard
gave
an
anxious
glance
at
Ada
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
avoided
saying
one
word
to

Esther

said
*NL*
Mr.

,
``
until
now

in

be
open

all
on

I
now
affectionately
advise

I
now
most
*NL*
earnestly

you

you
will
do

you

have
made

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
silence
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
Richard
,
''
said
Ada
then
,
raising
her
blue
eyes
tenderly
to
*NL*
his
face
,
``
after
what
our
cousin
John
has
said
,
I
think
no
choice
is
*NL*
left
us

Your
mind
may
be
quite
at
ease
about
me
,
for
you
will
leave
*NL*
me
here
under
his
care
and
will
be
sure
that
I
can
have
nothing
to
*NL*
wish
for
--
quite
sure
if
I
guide
myself
by
his
advice
.
I
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
doubt
,
cousin
Richard
,
''
said
Ada
,
a
little
confused
,
``
that
you
are
*NL*
very
fond
of
me
,
and
I
--
I
do
n't
think
you
will
fall
in
love
with
*NL*
anybody
else
.
But
I
should
like
you
to
consider
well
about
it
too
,
as
*NL*
I
should
like
you
to
be
in
all
things
very
happy
.
You
may
trust
in
*NL*
me
,
cousin
Richard
.
I
am
not
at
all
changeable
;
but
I
am
not
*NL*
unreasonable
,
and
should
never
blame
you
.
Even
cousins
may
be
sorry
*NL*
to
part
;
and
in
truth
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
,
Richard
,
though
I
know
*NL*
it
's
for
your
welfare
.
I
shall
always
think
of
you
affectionately
,
*NL*
and
often
talk
of
you
with
Esther
,
and
--
and
perhaps
you
will
*NL*
sometimes
think
a
little
of
me
,
cousin
Richard
.
So
now
,
''
said
Ada
,
*NL*
going
up
to
him
and
giving
him
her
trembling
hand
,
``
we
are
only
*NL*
cousins
again
,
Richard
--
for
the
time
perhaps
--
and
I
pray
for
a
*NL*
blessing
on
my
dear
cousin
,
wherever
he
goes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
strange
to
me
that
Richard
should
not
be
able
to
forgive
my
*NL*
guardian
for
entertaining
the
very
same
opinion
of
him
which
he
*NL*
himself
had
expressed
of
himself
in
much
stronger
terms
to
me
.
But
it
*NL*
was
certainly
the
case
.
I
observed
with
great
regret
that
from
this
*NL*
hour
he
never
was
as
free
and
open
with
Mr.
Jarndyce
as
he
had
been
*NL*
before
.
He
had
every
reason
given
him
to
be
so
,
but
he
was
not
;
and
*NL*
solely
on
his
side
,
an
estrangement
began
to
arise
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
business
of
preparation
and
equipment
he
soon
lost
himself
,
*NL*
and
even
his
grief
at
parting
from
Ada
,
who
remained
in
Hertfordshire
*NL*
while
he
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
and
I
went
up
to
London
for
a
week
.
He
*NL*
remembered
her
by
fits
and
starts
,
even
with
bursts
of
tears
,
and
at
*NL*
such
times
would
confide
to
me
the
heaviest
self-reproaches
.
But
in
a
*NL*
few
minutes
he
would
recklessly
conjure
up
some
undefinable
means
by
*NL*
which
they
were
both
to
be
made
rich
and
happy
for
ever
,
and
would
*NL*
become
as
gay
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
busy
time
,
and
I
trotted
about
with
him
all
day
long
,
buying
*NL*
a
variety
of
things
of
which
he
stood
in
need
.
Of
the
things
he
would
*NL*
have
bought
if
he
had
been
left
to
his
own
ways
I
say
nothing
.
He
was
*NL*
perfectly
confidential
with
me
,
and
often
talked
so
sensibly
and
*NL*
feelingly
about
his
faults
and
his
vigorous
resolutions
,
and
dwelt
so
*NL*
much
upon
the
encouragement
he
derived
from
these
conversations
that
*NL*
I
could
never
have
been
tired
if
I
had
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
used
,
in
that
week
,
to
come
backward
and
forward
to
our
lodging
*NL*
to
fence
with
Richard
a
person
who
had
formerly
been
a
cavalry
*NL*
soldier
;
he
was
a
fine
bluff-looking
man
,
of
a
frank
free
bearing
,
*NL*
with
whom
Richard
had
practised
for
some
months
.
I
heard
so
much
*NL*
about
him
,
not
only
from
Richard
,
but
from
my
guardian
too
,
that
I
*NL*
was
purposely
in
the
room
with
my
work
one
morning
after
breakfast
*NL*
when
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Mr.
George
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
who
happened
to
be
*NL*
alone
with
me
.
``
Mr.
Carstone
will
be
here
directly
.
Meanwhile
,
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
is
very
happy
to
see
you

I
know
.
Sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
,
a
little
disconcerted
by
my
presence
,
I
thought
,
and
*NL*
without
looking
at
me
,
drew
his
heavy
sunburnt
hand
across
and
across
*NL*
his
upper
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
as
punctual
as
the
sun
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Military
time

''
he
replied
.
``
Force
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet

large

said
Mr.

Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
good

he
replied
,
folding
his
arms
upon
his
broad
chest
*NL*
and
looking
very
large
.
``
If
Mr.
Carstone
was
to
give
his
full

would
come
out
very
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
do
n't

I
suppose

said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did

first

else

some
young

His
bright
*NL*
dark
eyes
glanced
at
me
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
not
me

I
assure

said
I
,
*NL*
laughing
,
``

you
seem
to
suspect
me

*NL*
*NL*
He
reddened
a
little
through
his
brown
and
made
me
a
trooper
's
bow
.
*NL*
``
No

said
I.
``

take

*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
not
looked
at
me
before
,
he
looked
at
me
now
in
three
or
*NL*
four
quick
successive
glances
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon

he
said
to
*NL*
my
guardian
with
a
manly
kind
of
diffidence
,
``

did
me
the

honour

*NL*

repeated

looked
at

again

I
asked

``

I
returned
,
raising
my
head
from
my
work
to
look
at

him
;
and
there
was
something
so
genuine
in
his
speech

manner
that

I
was
glad
of
the
opportunity

returned

fullness

His
once
more
reddening
through
his
brown
and
being
disconcerted
by

his
efforts
to
remember
the
association
brought
my

to

relief

``

with
grudges

schemes

finishing
their
*NL*
practice

said
my
guardian
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
of
that

though
that
HAS

Mostly
they

Six
of
one

and
half-a-dozen
of
the
other

*NL*
beg
your
pardon

''
said
Mr.
George
,
sitting
stiffly
upright
and
*NL*
squaring
an
elbow
on
each
knee
,
``
but
I
believe
you
're
a
Chancery
*NL*
suitor

I
have
heard
correct

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry

I
am

*NL*
``
I
have
had
one
of
YOUR

in
my
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Chancery
suitor
?
''
returned
my
guardian
.
``
How
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
man
was
so
badgered
and
worried
and
tortured
by
being
*NL*
knocked
about
from
post
to
pillar
,
and
from
pillar
to
post
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
George
,
``
that
he
got
out
of
sorts
.
I
do
n't
believe
he
had
any
idea
of
*NL*
taking
aim
at
anybody
,
but
he
was
in
that
condition
of
resentment
and
*NL*
violence
that
he
would
come
and
pay
for
fifty
shots
and
fire
away
*NL*
till
he
was
red
hot
.
One
day
I
said
to
him
when
there
was
nobody
by
*NL*
and
he
had
been
talking
to
me
angrily
about
his
wrongs
,
`
If
this
*NL*
practice
is
a
safety-valve
,
comrade
,
well
and
good
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
altogether
like
your
being
so
bent
upon
it
in
your
present
state
of
*NL*
mind
;
I
'd
rather
you
took
to
something
else
.
'
I
was
on
my
guard
for
a
*NL*
blow
,
he
was
that
passionate
;
but
he
received
it
in
very
good
part
*NL*
and
left
off
directly
.
We
shook
hands
and
struck
up
a
sort
of
*NL*
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that
man
?
''
asked
my
guardian
in
a
new
tone
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
began
by
being
a
small
Shropshire
farmer
before
they
made
a
*NL*
baited
bull
of
him
,
''
said
Mr.
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
his
name
Gridley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
directed
another
succession
of
quick
bright
glances
at
me
*NL*
as
my
guardian
and
I
exchanged
a
word
or
two
of
surprise
at
the
*NL*
coincidence
,
and
I
therefore
explained
to
him
how
we
knew
the
name
.
*NL*
He
made
me
another
of
his
soldierly
bows
in
acknowledgment
of
what
he
*NL*
called
my
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
as
he
looked
at
me
,
``
what
it
is
that
sets
me
*NL*
off
again
--
but
--
bosh
!
What
's
my
head
running
against
!
''
He
passed
one
*NL*
of
his
heavy
hands
over
his
crisp
dark
hair
as
if
to
sweep
the
broken
*NL*
thoughts
out
of
his
mind
and
sat
a
little
forward
,
with
one
arm
*NL*
akimbo
and
the
other
resting
on
his
leg
,
looking
in
a
brown
study
at
*NL*
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
learn
that
the
same
state
of
mind
has
got
this
Gridley
*NL*
into
new
troubles
and
that
he
is
in
hiding
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
told
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
George
,
still
musing
and
looking
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
``
So
I
am
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
trooper
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
and
coming
out
*NL*
of
his
reverie
.
``
I
ca
n't
say
anything
about
him
.
He
will
be
worn
out
*NL*
soon
,
I
expect
.
You
may
file
a
strong
man
's
heart
away
for
a
good
*NL*
many
years
,
but
it
will
tell
all
of
a
sudden
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
's
entrance
stopped
the
conversation
.
Mr.
George
rose
,
made
me
*NL*
another
of
his
soldierly
bows
,
wished
my
guardian
a
good
day
,
and
*NL*
strode
heavily
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
morning
of
the
day
appointed
for
Richard
's
departure
.
We
*NL*
had
no
more
purchases
to
make
now
;
I
had
completed
all
his
packing
*NL*
early
in
the
afternoon
;
and
our
time
was
disengaged
until
night
,
when
*NL*
he
was
to
go
to
Liverpool
for
Holyhead
.
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
being
*NL*
again
expected
to
come
on
that
day
,
Richard
proposed
to
me
that
we
*NL*
should
go
down
to
the
court
and
hear
what
passed
.
As
it
was
his
last
*NL*
day
,
and
he
was
eager
to
go
,
and
I
had
never
been
there
,
I
gave
my
*NL*
consent
and
we
walked
down
to
Westminster
,
where
the
court
was
then
*NL*
sitting
.
We
beguiled
the
way
with
arrangements
concerning
the
letters
*NL*
that
Richard
was
to
write
to
me
and
the
letters
that
I
was
to
write
*NL*
to
him
and
with
a
great
many
hopeful
projects
.
My
guardian
knew
where
*NL*
we
were
going
and
therefore
was
not
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
court
,
there
was
the
Lord
Chancellor
--
the
same
*NL*
whom
I
had
seen
in
his
private
room
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
--
sitting
in
*NL*
great
state
and
gravity
on
the
bench
,
with
the
mace
and
seals
on
a
*NL*
red
table
below
him
and
an
immense
flat
nosegay
,
like
a
little
*NL*
garden
,
which
scented
the
whole
court
.
Below
the
table
,
again
,
was
a
*NL*
long
row
of
solicitors
,
with
bundles
of
papers
on
the
matting
at
*NL*
their
feet
;
and
then
there
were
the
gentlemen
of
the
bar
in
wigs
and
*NL*
gowns
--
some
awake
and
some
asleep
,
and
one
talking
,
and
nobody
paying
*NL*
much
attention
to
what
he
said
.
The
Lord
Chancellor
leaned
back
in
*NL*
his
very
easy
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
cushioned
arm
and
his
*NL*
forehead
resting
on
his
hand
;
some
of
those
who
were
present
dozed
;
*NL*
some
read
the
newspapers
;
some
walked
about
or
whispered
in
groups
:
*NL*
all
seemed
perfectly
at
their
ease
,
by
no
means
in
a
hurry
,
very
*NL*
unconcerned
,
and
extremely
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
see
everything
going
on
so
smoothly
and
to
think
of
the
roughness
*NL*
of
the
suitors
'
lives
and
deaths
;
to
see
all
that
full
dress
and
*NL*
ceremony
and
to
think
of
the
waste
,
and
want
,
and
beggared
misery
it
*NL*
represented
;
to
consider
that
while
the
sickness
of
hope
deferred
was
*NL*
raging
in
so
many
hearts
this
polite
show
went
calmly
on
from
day
to
*NL*
day
,
and
year
to
year
,
in
such
good
order
and
composure
;
to
behold
*NL*
the
Lord
Chancellor
and
the
whole
array
of
practitioners
under
him
*NL*
looking
at
one
another
and
at
the
spectators
as
if
nobody
had
ever
*NL*
heard
that
all
over
England
the
name
in
which
they
were
assembled
was
*NL*
a
bitter
jest
,
was
held
in
universal
horror
,
contempt
,
and
*NL*
indignation
,
was
known
for
something
so
flagrant
and
bad
that
little
*NL*
short
of
a
miracle
could
bring
any
good
out
of
it
to
any
one
--
this
*NL*
was
so
curious
and
self-contradictory
to
me
,
who
had
no
experience
of
*NL*
it
,
that
it
was
at
first
incredible
,
and
I
could
not
comprehend
it
.
I
*NL*
sat
where
Richard
put
me
,
and
tried
to
listen
,
and
looked
about
me
;
*NL*
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
reality
in
the
whole
scene
except
poor
*NL*
little
Miss
Flite
,
the
madwoman
,
standing
on
a
bench
and
nodding
at
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Flite
soon
espied
us
and
came
to
where
we
sat
.
She
gave
me
a
*NL*
gracious
welcome
to
her
domain
and
indicated
,
with
much
gratification
*NL*
and
pride
,
its
principal
attractions
.
Mr.
Kenge
also
came
to
speak
to
*NL*
us
and
did
the
honours
of
the
place
in
much
the
same
way
,
with
the
*NL*
bland
modesty
of
a
proprietor
.
It
was
not
a
very
good
day
for
a
*NL*
visit
,
he
said
;
he
would
have
preferred
the
first
day
of
term
;
but
it
*NL*
was
imposing
,
it
was
imposing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
been
there
half
an
hour
or
so
,
the
case
in
progress
--
if
I
*NL*
may
use
a
phrase
so
ridiculous
in
such
a
connexion
--
seemed
to
die
out
*NL*
of
its
own
vapidity
,
without
coming
,
or
being
by
anybody
expected
to
*NL*
come
,
to
any
result
.
The
Lord
Chancellor
then
threw
down
a
bundle
of
*NL*
papers
from
his
desk
to
the
gentlemen
below
him
,
and
somebody
said
,
*NL*
``
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
''
Upon
this
there
was
a
buzz
,
and
a
laugh
,
and
*NL*
a
general
withdrawal
of
the
bystanders
,
and
a
bringing
in
of
great
*NL*
heaps
,
and
piles
,
and
bags
and
bags
full
of
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
came
on
``
for
further
directions
''
--
about
some
bill
of
*NL*
costs
,
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
,
which
was
confused
enough
.
*NL*
But
I
counted
twenty-three
gentlemen
in
wigs
who
said
they
were
``
in
*NL*
it
,
''
and
none
of
them
appeared
to
understand
it
much
better
than
I
.
*NL*
They
chatted
about
it
with
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
and
contradicted
and
*NL*
explained
among
themselves
,
and
some
of
them
said
it
was
this
way
,
*NL*
and
some
of
them
said
it
was
that
way
,
and
some
of
them
jocosely
*NL*
proposed
to
read
huge
volumes
of
affidavits
,
and
there
was
more
*NL*
buzzing
and
laughing
,
and
everybody
concerned
was
in
a
state
of
idle
*NL*
entertainment
,
and
nothing
could
be
made
of
it
by
anybody
.
After
an
*NL*
hour
or
so
of
this
,
and
a
good
many
speeches
being
begun
and
cut
*NL*
short
,
it
was
``
referred
back
for
the
present
,
''
as
Mr.
Kenge
said
,
and
*NL*
the
papers
were
bundled
up
again
before
the
clerks
had
finished
*NL*
bringing
them
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
at
Richard
on
the
termination
of
these
hopeless
proceedings
*NL*
and
was
shocked
to
see
the
worn
look
of
his
handsome
young
face
.
``
It
*NL*
ca
n't
last
for
ever
,
Dame
Durden
.
Better
luck
next
time
!
''
was
all
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
seen
Mr.
Guppy
bringing
in
papers
and
arranging
them
for
Mr.
*NL*
Kenge
;
and
he
had
seen
me
and
made
me
a
forlorn
bow
,
which
rendered
*NL*
me
desirous
to
get
out
of
the
court
.
Richard
had
given
me
his
arm
and
*NL*
was
taking
me
away
when
Mr.
Guppy
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Carstone
,
''
said
he
in
a
whisper
,
``
and
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
's
also
,
but
there
's
a
lady
here
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
*NL*
knows
her
and
wishes
to
have
the
pleasure
of
shaking
hands
.
''
As
he
*NL*
spoke
,
I
saw
before
me
,
as
if
she
had
started
into
bodily
shape
from
*NL*
my
remembrance
,
Mrs.
Rachael
of
my
godmother
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Esther
?
''
said
she
.
``
Do
you
recollect
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
her
my
hand
and
told
her
yes
and
that
she
was
very
little
*NL*
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
remember
those
times
,
Esther
,
''
she
returned
with
her
*NL*
old
asperity
.
``
They
are
changed
now
.
Well
!
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
and
*NL*
glad
you
are
not
too
proud
to
know
me
.
''
But
indeed
she
seemed
*NL*
disappointed
that
I
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proud
,
Mrs.
Rachael
!
''
I
remonstrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
married
,
Esther
,
''
she
returned
,
coldly
correcting
me
,
``
and
am
*NL*
Mrs.
Chadband
.
Well
!
I
wish
you
good
day
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
do
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
,
who
had
been
attentive
to
this
short
dialogue
,
heaved
a
*NL*
sigh
in
my
ear
and
elbowed
his
own
and
Mrs.
Rachael
's
way
through
the
*NL*
confused
little
crowd
of
people
coming
in
and
going
out
,
which
we
*NL*
were
in
the
midst
of
and
which
the
change
in
the
business
had
brought
*NL*
together
.
Richard
and
I
were
making
our
way
through
it
,
and
I
was
yet
*NL*
in
the
first
chill
of
the
late
unexpected
recognition
when
I
saw
,
*NL*
coming
towards
us
,
but
not
seeing
us
,
no
less
a
person
than
Mr.
*NL*
George
.
He
made
nothing
of
the
people
about
him
as
he
tramped
on
,
*NL*
staring
over
their
heads
into
the
body
of
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
''
said
Richard
as
I
called
his
attention
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
well
met
,
sir
,
''
he
returned
.
``
And
you
,
miss
.
Could
you
point
*NL*
a
person
out
for
me
,
I
want
?
I
do
n't
understand
these
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
as
he
spoke
and
making
an
easy
way
for
us
,
he
stopped
when
we
*NL*
were
out
of
the
press
in
a
corner
behind
a
great
red
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
little
cracked
old
woman
,
''
he
began
,
``
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
up
my
finger
,
for
Miss
Flite
was
close
by
me
,
having
kept
*NL*
beside
me
all
the
time
and
having
called
the
attention
of
several
of
*NL*
her
legal
acquaintance
to
me
-LRB-
as
I
had
overheard
to
my
confusion
-RRB-
by
*NL*
whispering
in
their
ears
,
``
Hush
!
Fitz
Jarndyce
on
my
left
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hem
!

said
Mr.
George
.
``

in
a
low

whisper
behind
his

``
Yes
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
hiding
at
my
place
.
I
could
n't
mention
it
.
Had
n't
his
*NL*
authority
.
He
is
on
his
last
march
,
miss
,
and
has
a
whim
to
see
her
.
*NL*
He
says
they
can
feel
for
one
another
,
and
she
has
been
almost
as
*NL*
good
as
a
friend
to
him
here
.
I
came
down
to
look
for
her
,
for
when
I
*NL*
sat
by
Gridley
this
afternoon
,
I
seemed
to
hear
the
roll
of
the
*NL*
muffled
drums
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
her
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
be
so
good
?
''
he
returned
with
a
glance
of
something
like
*NL*
apprehension
at
Miss
Flite
.
``
It
's
a
providence
I
met
you
,
miss
;
I
*NL*
doubt
if
I
should
have
known
how
to
get
on
with
that
lady
.
''
And
he
*NL*
put
one
hand
in
his
breast
and
stood
upright
in
a
martial
attitude
as
*NL*
I
informed
little
Miss
Flite
,
in
her
ear
,
of
the
purport
of
his
kind
*NL*
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
angry
friend
from
Shropshire
!
Almost
as
celebrated
as
myself
!
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
.
``
Now
really
!
My
dear
,
I
will
wait
upon
him
with
the
*NL*
greatest
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
living
concealed
at
Mr.
George
's
,
''
said
I.
``
Hush
!
This
is
Mr.
*NL*
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
--
deed
!
''
returned
Miss
Flite
.
``
Very
proud
to
have
the
honour
!
A
*NL*
military
man
,
my
dear
.
You
know
,
a
perfect
general
!
''
she
whispered
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Miss
Flite
deemed
it
necessary
to
be
so
courtly
and
polite
,
as
a
*NL*
mark
of
her
respect
for
the
army
,
and
to
curtsy
so
very
often
that
it
*NL*
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
her
out
of
the
court
.
When
this
was
at
last
*NL*
done
,
and
addressing
Mr.
George
as
``
General
,
''
she
gave
him
her
arm
,
*NL*
to
the
great
entertainment
of
some
idlers
who
were
looking
on
,
he
was
*NL*
so
discomposed
and
begged
me
so
respectfully
``
not
to
desert
him
''
that
*NL*
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
,
especially
as
Miss
Flite
was
*NL*
always
tractable
with
me
and
as
she
too
said
,
``
Fitz
Jarndyce
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
you
will
accompany
us
,
of
course
.
''
As
Richard
seemed
quite
*NL*
willing
,
and
even
anxious
,
that
we
should
see
them
safely
to
their
*NL*
destination
,
we
agreed
to
do
so
.
And
as
Mr.
George
informed
us
that
*NL*
Gridley
's
mind
had
run
on
Mr.
Jarndyce
all
the
afternoon
after
*NL*
hearing
of
their
interview
in
the
morning
,
I
wrote
a
hasty
note
in
*NL*
pencil
to
my
guardian
to
say
where
we
were
gone
and
why
.
Mr.
George
*NL*
sealed
it
at
a
coffee-house
,
that
it
might
lead
to
no
discovery
,
and
*NL*
we
sent
it
off
by
a
ticket-porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
then
took
a
hackney-coach
and
drove
away
to
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
Leicester
Square
.
We
walked
through
some
narrow
courts
,
for
which
Mr.
*NL*
George
apologized
,
and
soon
came
to
the
shooting
gallery
,
the
door
of
*NL*
which
was
closed
.
As
he
pulled
a
bell-handle
which
hung
by
a
chain
to
*NL*
the
door-post
,
a
very
respectable
old
gentleman
with
grey
hair
,
*NL*
wearing
spectacles
,
and
dressed
in
a
black
spencer
and
gaiters
and
a
*NL*
broad-brimmed
hat
,
and
carrying
a
large
gold-beaded
cane
,
addressed
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
my
good
friend
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
is
this
George
's
*NL*
Shooting
Gallery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
George
,
glancing
up
at
the
great
letters
*NL*
in
which
that
inscription
was
painted
on
the
whitewashed
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
To
be
sure
!
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
following
his
eyes
.
``
Thank
*NL*
you
.
Have
you
rung
the
bell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
George
,
sir
,
and
I
have
rung
the
bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
?
''
said
the
old
gentleman
.
``
Your
name
is
George
?
Then
I
am
*NL*
here
as
soon
as
you
,
you
see
.
You
came
for
me
,
no
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
You
have
the
advantage
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
?
''
said
the
old
gentleman
.
``
Then
it
was
your
young
man
who
*NL*
came
for
me
.
I
am
a
physician
and
was
requested
--
five
minutes
ago
--
to
*NL*
come
and
visit
a
sick
man
at
George
's
Shooting
Gallery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
muffled
drums
,
''
said
Mr.
George
,
turning
to
Richard
and
me
and
*NL*
gravely
shaking
his
head
.
``
It
's
quite
correct
,
sir
.
Will
you
please
*NL*
to
walk
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
being
at
that
moment
opened
by
a
very
singular-looking
*NL*
little
man
in
a
green-baize
cap
and
apron
,
whose
face
and
hands
and
*NL*
dress
were
blackened
all
over
,
we
passed
along
a
dreary
passage
into
*NL*
a
large
building
with
bare
brick
walls
where
there
were
targets
,
and
*NL*
guns
,
and
swords
,
and
other
things
of
that
kind
.
When
we
had
all
*NL*
arrived
here
,
the
physician
stopped
,
and
taking
off
his
hat
,
appeared
*NL*
to
vanish
by
magic
and
to
leave
another
and
quite
a
different
man
in
*NL*
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
lookee
here
,
George
,
''
said
the
man
,
turning
quickly
round
upon
*NL*
him
and
tapping
him
on
the
breast
with
a
large
forefinger
.
``
You
know
*NL*
me
,
and
I
know
you
.
You
're
a
man
of
the
world

I
'm
a
man
of
the
*NL*
world
.
My
name

Bucket
,
as
you
are
aware
,
and
I
have
got
a
*NL*
peace-warrant
against
Gridley
.
You
have
kept
him
out
of
the
way
a
*NL*
long
time
,
and
you
have
been
artful
in
it
,
and
it
does
you
credit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
,
looking
hard
at
him
,
bit
his
lip
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
George
,
''
said
the
other
,
keeping
close
to
him
,
``
you
're
a
*NL*
sensible

that

*NL*
doubt
.
And
mind
you
,
I
do
n't
talk
to
you
as
a
common
character
,
*NL*
because
you
have
served
your
country
and
you
know
that
when
duty
*NL*
calls
we
must
obey
.
Consequently
you
're
very
far
from
wanting
to
give
*NL*
trouble
.
If
I
required
assistance
,
you
'd
assist
me
;
that
's
what
YOU

*NL*
do

Phil
Squod
,
do
n't
you
go
a-sidling
round
the
gallery
like
*NL*
that
''
--
the
dirty
little
man
was
shuffling
about
with
his
shoulder
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
and
his
eyes
on
the
intruder
,
in
a
manner
that
*NL*
looked
threatening
--
``
because
I
know
you

wo
n't

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
man
,
with
a
low
growl
,
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
you
'll
excuse
anything

I
have
a
duty
to
perform

George

I
know
where
*NL*
my

is
because
I
was
on
the
roof
last
night
and
saw
him
through
*NL*
the
skylight
,
and
you
along
with
him

He
is

pointing
;

must
tell
my

consider

in

but
you

you
know

accommodate
you
to
the

of
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
it
,

was
the
reply
.
``
But
it
was
n't
handsome
in
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gammon

George

Not
handsome

''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
tapping
him
on
his
*NL*
broad
breast
again
and
shaking
hands
with
him
.
``
I
do
n't
say

in

*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
I
'd
give
a
fifty-pun

note
to
be
such
a
figure
*NL*
of
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
affair
being
brought
to
this
head
,
Mr.
George
,
after
a
little
*NL*
consideration
,
proposed
to
go
in
first
to
his
comrade
-LRB-
as
he
called
*NL*
him
-RRB-
,
taking
Miss
Flite
with
him
.
Mr.
Bucket
agreeing
,
they
went
away
*NL*
to
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
,
leaving
us
sitting
and
standing
by
*NL*
a
table
covered
with
guns
.
Mr.
Bucket
took
this
opportunity
of
*NL*
entering
into
a
little
light
conversation
,
asking
me
if
I
were
afraid
*NL*
of
fire-arms
,
as
most
young
ladies
were
;
asking
Richard
if
he
were
a
*NL*
good
shot
;
asking
Phil
Squod
which
he
considered
the
best
of
those
*NL*
rifles
and
what
it
might
be
worth
first-hand
,
telling
him
in
return
*NL*
that
it
was
a
pity
he
ever
gave
way
to
his
temper
,
for
he
was
*NL*
naturally
so
amiable
that
he
might
have
been
a
young
woman
,
and
*NL*
making
himself
generally
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
followed
us
to
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
,
and
*NL*
Richard
and
I
were
going
quietly
away
when
Mr.
George
came
after
us
.
*NL*
He
said
that
if
we
had
no
objection
to
see
his
comrade
,
he
would
take
*NL*
a
visit
from
us
very
kindly
.
The
words
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
*NL*
when
the
bell
was
rung
and
my
guardian
appeared
,
``
on
the
chance
,
''
he
*NL*
slightly
observed
,
``
of
being
able
to
do
any
little
thing
for
a
poor
*NL*
fellow
involved
in
the
same
misfortune
as
himself
.
''
We
all
four
went
*NL*
back
together
and
went
into
the
place
where
Gridley
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bare
room
,
partitioned
off
from
the
gallery
with
unpainted
*NL*
wood
.
As
the
screening
was
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
*NL*
only
enclosed
the
sides
,
not
the
top
,
the
rafters
of
the
high
gallery
*NL*
roof
were
overhead
,
and
the
skylight
through
which
Mr.
Bucket
had
*NL*
looked
down
.
The
sun
was
low
--
near
setting
--
and
its
light
came
redly
*NL*
in
above
,
without
descending
to
the
ground
.
Upon
a
plain
*NL*
canvas-covered
sofa
lay
the
man
from
Shropshire
,
dressed
much
as
we
*NL*
had
seen
him
last
,
but
so
changed
that
at
first
I
recognized
no
*NL*
likeness
in
his
colourless
face
to
what
I
recollected
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
still
writing
in
his
hiding-place
,
and
still
dwelling
on
*NL*
his
grievances
,
hour
after
hour
.
A
table
and
some
shelves
were
*NL*
covered
with
manuscript
papers
and
with
worn
pens
and
a
medley
of
*NL*
such
tokens
.
Touchingly
and
awfully
drawn
together
,
he
and
the
little
*NL*
mad
woman
were
side
by
side
and
,
as
it
were
,
alone
.
She
sat
on
a
*NL*
chair
holding
his
hand
,
and
none
of
us
went
close
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
had
faded
,
with
the
old
expression
of
his
face
,
with
his
*NL*
strength
,
with
his
anger
,
with
his
resistance
to
the
wrongs
that
had
*NL*
at
last
subdued
him
.
The
faintest
shadow
of
an
object
full
of
form
*NL*
and
colour
is
such
a
picture
of
it
as
he
was
of
the
man
from
*NL*
Shropshire
whom
we
had
spoken
with
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inclined
his
head
to
Richard
and
me
and
spoke
to
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
.
I
am
not
*NL*
long
to
be
seen
,
I
think
.
I
am
very
glad
to
take
your
hand
,
sir
.
You
*NL*
are
a
good
man
,
superior
to
injustice
,
and
God
knows
I
honour
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
earnestly
,
and
my
guardian
said
some
words
of
*NL*
comfort
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
seem
strange
to
you
,
sir
,
''
returned
Gridley
;
``
I
should
not
*NL*
have
liked
to
see
you
if
this
had
been
the
first
time
of
our
meeting
.
*NL*
But
you
know
I
made
a
fight
for
it
,
you
know
I
stood
up
with
my
*NL*
single
hand
against
them
all
,
you
know
I
told
them
the
truth
to
the
*NL*
last
,
and
told
them
what
they
were
,
and
what
they
had
done
to
me
;
so
*NL*
I
do
n't
mind
your
seeing
me
,
this
wreck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
courageous
with
them
many
and
many
a
time
,
''
returned
*NL*
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
have
been
,
''
with
a
faint
smile
.
``
I
told
you
what
would
come
*NL*
of
it
when
I
ceased
to
be
so
,
and
see
here
!
Look
at
us
--
look
at
us
!
''
*NL*
He
drew
the
hand
Miss
Flite
held
through
her

brought

something
nearer

this

*NL*
``
I
thought
,
boastfully

that
they
never
could
break
my
heart

Mr.

I
was
resolved
that
they
should
not

I
did
believe
that
I
*NL*
could

charge
them
with
being
the
mockery
they
were
until
*NL*
I
died
of
some
bodily

But
I
am
worn
out

How
long
I
have
*NL*
been
wearing
out

I
do
n't

I
seemed
to
break
down
in
an
hour

I
*NL*
hope
they
may
never
come

hear
of
it

I
hope
everybody
here
will
*NL*
lead
them
to
believe
that
I
died
defying

perseveringly

I
did
through
so
many
years

*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Bucket
,
who
was
sitting
in
a
corner
by
the
door

*NL*
good-naturedly
offered
such
consolation
as
he
could
administer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

he
said
from
his

``
Do

We

a
little
low

hold
up

You
'll
lose
your
temper

whole

take
you
on

*NL*
*NL*
He
only
shook
his
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Mr.

``
Nod

that

Why

was

two

a

there

been
always

*NL*

said
Bucket
in

Then
resuming
his
*NL*
encouragement
,
he
pursued
aloud
:
``
Worn
out
,
Mr.

After

dodging
me
for

forcing
me
to
climb

roof
here
*NL*
like
a

to
come

see
you
as
a
doctor

That
ai
n't
like
*NL*
being
worn
out
.
I
should
think
not
!
Now
I
tell
you
what
you
want

You
*NL*
want
excitement
,
you
know
,
to
keep
YOU
up
;
that
's
what
YOU
want
.
*NL*
You
're
used
to
it
,
and
you
ca
n't
do
without
it

I
could
n't
myself

*NL*
Very
well
,
then
;
here
's
this
warrant
got
by
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
of
*NL*
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
and
backed
into
half-a-dozen
counties
since
.
*NL*
What
do
you
say
to
coming
along
with
me
,
upon
this
warrant

and
*NL*
having
a
good
angry
argument
before
the
magistrates
?
It
'll
do
you
*NL*
good
;
it
'll
freshen
you
up
and
get
you
into
training
for
another
turn
*NL*
at
the
Chancellor
.
Give
in
?
Why
,
I
am
surprised
to
hear
a
man
of
your
*NL*
energy
talk
of
giving
in

You
must
n't
do
that

You
're
half
the
fun
of
*NL*
the
fair
in
the
Court
of
Chancery
.
George
,
you
lend
Mr.
Gridley
a
*NL*
hand
,
and
let
's
see
now
whether
he
wo
n't
be
better
up
than
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
weak

said
the
trooper
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
?
''
returned
Bucket
anxiously
.
``
I
only
want
to
rouse
him
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
to
see
an
old
acquaintance
giving

like
this
.
It
would
*NL*
cheer
him
up
more
than
anything
if
I
could
make
him
a
little
waxy
*NL*
with
me
.
He
's
welcome
to
drop
into
me
,
right

left
,
if
he
likes
.
I
*NL*
shall
never
take
advantage
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
The
roof
rang
with
a
scream
from
Miss
Flite
,
which
still
rings
in
my
*NL*
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Gridley
!
''
she
cried
as
he
fell
heavily
and
calmly
back
from
*NL*
before
her
.
``
Not
without
my
blessing

After
so
many
years
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
down
,
the
light
had
gradually
stolen
from
the
roof
,
and
*NL*
the
shadow
had
crept
upward
.
But
to
me
the
shadow
of
that
pair
,
one
*NL*
living
and
one
dead
,
fell
heavier
on
Richard
's
departure
than
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
darkest
night
.
And
through
Richard
's
farewell
words
I
*NL*
heard
it
echoed
:
``
Of
all
my
old
associations

of
all
my

this
one
poor

alone
comes
natural

I

There
is
a
tie
of
many
*NL*
suffering
years
between

it
is
the

ever

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
Sees
It
All
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
disquietude
in
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
.
Black
*NL*
suspicion
hides
in
that
peaceful
region
.
The
mass
of
Cook
's
Courtiers
*NL*
are
in
their
usual
state
of
mind
,
no
better
and
no
worse
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
is
changed
,
and
his
little
woman
knows
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Tom-all-Alone
's
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
persist
in
harnessing
*NL*
themselves
,
a
pair
of
ungovernable
coursers
,
to
the
chariot
of
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
's
imagination
;
and
Mr.
Bucket
drives
;
and
the
passengers
are
*NL*
Jo
and
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
;
and
the
complete
equipage
whirls
though
the
*NL*
law-stationery
business
at
wild
speed
all
round
the
clock
.
Even
in
*NL*
the
little
front
kitchen
where
the
family
meals
are
taken
,
it
rattles
*NL*
away
at
a
smoking
pace
from
the
dinner-table
,
when
Mr.
Snagsby
pauses
*NL*
in
carving
the
first
slice
of
the
leg
of
mutton
baked
with
potatoes
*NL*
and
stares
at
the
kitchen
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
can
not
make
out
what
it
is
that
he
has
had
to
do
with
.
*NL*
Something
is
wrong
somewhere
,
but
what
something
,
what
may
come
of
*NL*
it
,
to
whom
,
when
,
and
from
which
unthought
of
and
unheard
of
quarter
*NL*
is
the
puzzle
of
his
life
.
His
remote
impressions
of
the
robes
and
*NL*
coronets
,
the
stars
and
garters
,
that
sparkle
through
the
*NL*
surface-dust
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
chambers
;
his
veneration
for
the
*NL*
mysteries
presided
over
by
that
best
and
closest
of
his
customers
,
*NL*
whom
all
the
Inns
of
Court
,
all
Chancery
Lane
,
and
all
the
legal
*NL*
neighbourhood
agree
to
hold
in
awe
;
his
remembrance
of
Detective
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
with
his
forefinger
and
his
confidential
manner
,
impossible
to
*NL*
be
evaded
or
declined
,
persuade
him
that
he
is
a
party
to
some
*NL*
dangerous
secret
without
knowing
what
it
is
.
And
it
is
the
fearful
*NL*
peculiarity
of
this
condition
that
,
at
any
hour
of
his
daily
life
,
at
*NL*
any
opening
of
the
shop-door
,
at
any
pull
of
the
bell
,
at
any
*NL*
entrance
of
a
messenger
,
or
any
delivery
of
a
letter
,
the
secret
may
*NL*
take
air
and
fire
,
explode
,
and
blow
up
--
Mr.
Bucket
only
knows
whom
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
which
reason
,
whenever
a
man
unknown
comes
into
the
shop
-LRB-
as
many
*NL*
men
unknown
do
-RRB-
and
says
,
``
Is
Mr.
Snagsby
in
?
''
or
words
to
that
*NL*
innocent
effect
,
Mr.
Snagsby
's
heart
knocks
hard
at
his
guilty
*NL*
breast
.
He
undergoes
so
much
from
such
inquiries
that
when
they
are
*NL*
made
by
boys
he
revenges
himself
by
flipping
at
their
ears
over
the
*NL*
counter
and
asking
the
young
dogs
what
they
mean
by
it
and
why
they
*NL*
ca
n't
speak
out
at
once
?
More
impracticable
men
and
boys
persist
in
*NL*
walking
into
Mr.
Snagsby
's
sleep
and
terrifying
him
with
*NL*
unaccountable
questions
,
so
that
often
when
the
cock
at
the
little
*NL*
dairy
in
Cursitor
Street
breaks
out
in
his
usual
absurd
way
about
the
*NL*
morning
,
Mr.
Snagsby
finds
himself
in
a
crisis
of
nightmare
,
with
his
*NL*
little
woman
shaking
him
and
saying
``
What
's
the
matter
with
the
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
woman
herself
is
not
the
least
item
in
his
difficulty
.
To
*NL*
know
that
he
is
always
keeping
a
secret
from
her
,
that
he
has
under
*NL*
all
circumstances
to
conceal
and
hold
fast
a
tender
double
tooth
,
*NL*
which
her
sharpness
is
ever
ready
to
twist
out
of
his
head
,
gives
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
,
in
her
dentistical
presence
,
much
of
the
air
of
a
dog
who
*NL*
has
a
reservation
from
his
master
and
will
look
anywhere
rather
than
*NL*
meet
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
various
signs
and
tokens
,
marked
by
the
little
woman
,
are
not
*NL*
lost
upon
her
.
They
impel
her
to
say
,
``
Snagsby
has
something
on
his
*NL*
mind
!
''
And
thus
suspicion
gets
into
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
.
*NL*
From
suspicion
to
jealousy
,
Mrs.
Snagsby
finds
the
road
as
natural
*NL*
and
short
as
from
Cook
's
Court
to
Chancery
Lane
.
And
thus
jealousy
*NL*
gets
into
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
.
Once
there
-LRB-
and
it
was
*NL*
always
lurking
thereabout
-RRB-
,
it
is
very
active
and
nimble
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
's
breast
,
prompting
her
to
nocturnal
examinations
of
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
's
pockets
;
to
secret
perusals
of
Mr.
Snagsby
's
letters
;
to
*NL*
private
researches
in
the
day
book
and
ledger
,
till
,
cash-box
,
and
*NL*
iron
safe
;
to
watchings
at
windows
,
listenings
behind
doors
,
and
a
*NL*
general
putting
of
this
and
that
together
by
the
wrong
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
is
so
perpetually
on
the
alert
that
the
house
becomes
*NL*
ghostly
with
creaking
boards
and
rustling
garments
.
The
`
prentices
*NL*
think
somebody
may
have
been
murdered
there
in
bygone
times
.
Guster
*NL*
holds
certain
loose
atoms
of
an
idea
-LRB-
picked
up
at
Tooting
,
where
*NL*
they
were
found
floating
among
the
orphans
-RRB-
that
there
is
buried
*NL*
money
underneath
the
cellar
,
guarded
by
an
old
man
with
a
white
*NL*
beard
,
who
can
not
get
out
for
seven
thousand
years
because
he
said
*NL*
the
Lord
's
Prayer
backwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
Nimrod
?
''
Mrs.
Snagsby
repeatedly
inquires
of
herself
.
``
Who
*NL*
was
that
lady
--
that
creature
?
And
who
is
that
boy
?
''
Now
,
Nimrod
being
*NL*
as
dead
as
the
mighty
hunter
whose
name
Mrs.
Snagsby
has
*NL*
appropriated
,
and
the
lady
being
unproducible
,
she
directs
her
mental
*NL*
eye
,
for
the
present
,
with
redoubled
vigilance
to
the
boy
.
``
And
who
,
''
*NL*
quoth
Mrs.
Snagsby
for
the
thousand
and
first
time
,
``
is
that
boy
?
Who
*NL*
is
that
--
!
''
And
there
Mrs.
Snagsby
is
seized
with
an
inspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
no
respect
for
Mr.
Chadband
.
No
,
to
be
sure
,
and
he
would
n't
*NL*
have
,
of
course
.
Naturally
he
would
n't
,
under
those
contagious
*NL*
circumstances
.
He
was
invited
and
appointed
by
Mr.
Chadband
--
why
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
heard
it
herself
with
her
own
ears
!
--
to
come
back
,
and
*NL*
be
told
where
he
was
to
go
,
to
be
addressed
by
Mr.
Chadband
;
and
he
*NL*
never
came
!
Why
did
he
never
come
?
Because
he
was
told
not
to
come
.
*NL*
Who
told
him
not
to
come
?
Who
?
Ha
,
ha
!
Mrs.
Snagsby
sees
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
happily
-LRB-
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
tightly
shakes
her
head
and
tightly
*NL*
smiles
-RRB-
that
boy
was
met
by
Mr.
Chadband
yesterday
in
the
streets
;
*NL*
and
that
boy
,
as
affording
a
subject
which
Mr.
Chadband
desires
to
*NL*
improve
for
the
spiritual
delight
of
a
select
congregation
,
was
*NL*
seized
by
Mr.
Chadband
and
threatened
with
being
delivered
over
to
*NL*
the
police
unless
he
showed
the
reverend
gentleman
where
he
lived
and
*NL*
unless
he
entered
into
,
and
fulfilled
,
an
undertaking
to
appear
in
*NL*
Cook
's
Court
to-morrow
night
,
``
to

mor

row
--
night
,
''
Mrs.
Snagsby
*NL*
repeats
for
mere
emphasis
with
another
tight
smile
and
another
tight
*NL*
shake
of
her
head
;
and
to-morrow
night
that
boy
will
be
here
,
and
*NL*
to-morrow
night
Mrs.
Snagsby
will
have
her
eye
upon
him
and
upon
some
*NL*
one
else
;
and
oh
,
you
may
walk
a
long
while
in
your
secret
ways
-LRB-
says
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
with
haughtiness
and
scorn
-RRB-
,
but
you
ca
n't
blind
ME
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
sounds
no
timbrel
in
anybody
's
ears
,
but
holds
her
*NL*
purpose
quietly
,
and
keeps
her
counsel
.
To-morrow
comes
,
the
savoury
*NL*
preparations
for
the
Oil
Trade
come
,
the
evening
comes
.
Comes
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
in
his
black
coat
;
come
the
Chadbands
;
come
-LRB-
when
the
gorging
*NL*
vessel
is
replete
-RRB-
the
`
prentices
and
Guster
,
to
be
edified
;
comes
at
*NL*
last
,
with
his
slouching
head
,
and
his
shuffle
backward
,
and
his
*NL*
shuffle
forward
,
and
his
shuffle
to
the
right
,
and
his
shuffle
to
the
*NL*
left
,
and
his
bit
of
fur
cap
in
his
muddy
hand
,
which
he
picks
as
if
*NL*
it
were
some
mangy
bird
he
had
caught
and
was
plucking
before
eating
*NL*
raw
,
Jo
,
the
very
,
very
tough
subject
Mr.
Chadband
is
to
improve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
screws
a
watchful
glance
on
Jo
as
he
is
brought
into
the
*NL*
little
drawing-room
by
Guster
.
He
looks
at
Mr.
Snagsby
the
moment
he
*NL*
comes
in
.
Aha
!
Why
does
he
look
at
Mr.
Snagsby
?
Mr.
Snagsby
looks
at
*NL*
him
.
Why
should
he
do
that
,
but
that
Mrs.
Snagsby
sees
it
all
?
Why
*NL*
else
should
that
look
pass
between
them
,
why
else
should
Mr.
Snagsby
*NL*
be
confused
and
cough
a
signal
cough
behind
his
hand
?
It
is
as
clear
*NL*
as
crystal
that
Mr.
Snagsby
is
that
boy
's
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
my
friends
,
''
says
Chadband
,
rising
and
wiping
the
oily
*NL*
exudations
from
his
reverend
visage
.
``
Peace
be
with
us
!
My
friends
,
*NL*
why
with
us
?
Because
,
''
with
his
fat
smile
,
``
it
can
not
be
against
us
,
*NL*
because
it
must
be
for
us
;
because
it
is
not
hardening

because
it
is
*NL*
softening
;
because
it
does
not
make
war
like
the
hawk
,
but
comes
home
*NL*
unto
us
like
the
dove

Therefore

peace
be

My
*NL*
human

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stretching
forth
his
flabby
paw
,
Mr.
Chadband
lays
the
same
on
Jo
's
*NL*
arm
and
considers
where
to
station
him
.
Jo
,
very
doubtful
of
his
*NL*
reverend
friend
's
intentions
and
not
at
all
clear
but
that
something
*NL*
practical
and
painful
is
going
to
be
done
to
him
,
mutters
,
``
You
let
*NL*
me
alone
.
I
never
said
nothink
to
you
.
You
let
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
young
friend

''
says
Chadband
smoothly
,
``
I
will
not
let
you
*NL*
alone

And
why
?
Because
I
am
a
harvest-labourer
,
because
I
am
a
*NL*
toiler
and
a
moiler
,
because
you
are
delivered
over
unto
me
and
are
*NL*
become
as
a
precious
instrument
in
my

My

I
so
*NL*
employ
this

as
to
use
it
to
your
advantage

to
your
*NL*
profit
,
to
your
gain
,
to
your
welfare

to
your
enrichment

My
young
*NL*
friend
,
sit
upon
this
stool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
,
apparently
possessed
by
an
impression
that
the
reverend
gentleman
*NL*
wants
to
cut
his
hair
,
shields
his
head
with
both
arms
and
is
got
*NL*
into
the
required
position
with
great
difficulty
and
every
possible
*NL*
manifestation
of
reluctance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
is
at
last
adjusted
like
a
lay-figure
,
Mr.
Chadband
,
retiring
*NL*
behind
the
table
,
holds
up
his
bear
's
-
paw
and
says
,
``
My
friends
!
''
*NL*
This
is
the
signal
for
a
general
settlement
of
the
audience
.
The
*NL*
`
prentices
giggle
internally
and
nudge
each
other
.
Guster
falls
into
*NL*
a
staring
and
vacant
state
,
compounded
of
a
stunned
admiration
of
Mr.
*NL*
Chadband
and
pity
for
the
friendless
outcast
whose
condition
touches
*NL*
her
nearly
.
Mrs.
Snagsby
silently
lays
trains
of
gunpowder
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Chadband
composes
herself
grimly
by
the
fire
and
warms
her
knees
,
*NL*
finding
that
sensation
favourable
to
the
reception
of
eloquence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happens
that
Mr.
Chadband
has
a
pulpit
habit
of
fixing
some
member
*NL*
of
his
congregation
with
his
eye
and
fatly
arguing
his
points
with
*NL*
that
particular
person
,
who
is
understood
to
be
expected
to
be
moved
*NL*
to
an
occasional
grunt
,
groan
,
gasp
,
or
other
audible
expression
of
*NL*
inward
working
,
which
expression
of
inward
working
,
being
echoed
by
*NL*
some
elderly
lady
in
the
next
pew
and
so
communicated
like
a
game
of
*NL*
forfeits
through
a
circle
of
the
more
fermentable
sinners
present
,
*NL*
serves
the
purpose
of
parliamentary
cheering
and
gets
Mr.
Chadband
's
*NL*
steam
up
.
From
mere
force
of
habit
,
Mr.
Chadband
in
saying
``
My
*NL*
friends
!
''
has
rested
his
eye
on
Mr.
Snagsby
and
proceeds
to
make
that
*NL*
ill-starred
stationer
,
already
sufficiently
confused
,
the
immediate
*NL*
recipient
of
his
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
here
among

''
says
Chadband
,
``
a
Gentile

*NL*
heathen

*NL*
upon

*NL*
and
Mr.
Chadband
,
untwisting
the
point
with
his
dirty
thumb-nail
,
*NL*
bestows
an
oily
smile
on
Mr.
Snagsby
,
signifying
that
he
will
throw
*NL*
him
an
argumentative
back-fall
presently
if
he
be
not
already
down
,
*NL*
``

devoid

Now

my
friends
,
why
do
I
say
he
is
devoid
of
these
*NL*
possessions
?
Why

Why
is
he
?
''
Mr.
Chadband
states
the
question
as
if
*NL*
he
were
propounding
an
entirely
new
riddle
of
much
ingenuity
and
*NL*
merit
to
Mr.
Snagsby
and
entreating
him
not
to
give
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
,
greatly
perplexed
by
the
mysterious
look
he
received
*NL*
just
now
from
his
little
woman
--
at
about
the
period
when
Mr.
Chadband
*NL*
mentioned
the
word

is
tempted
into
modestly
remarking
,
``

On
which
interruption
Mrs.

*NL*
glares
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
says
,
``
For
shame

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
a

says
Chadband
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chadband
draws
back
his
head
and
pauses
,
but
Mr.
Snagsby
is
not
*NL*
to
be
lured
on
to
his
destruction
again
.
Mr.
Chadband
,
leaning
*NL*
forward
over
the
table
,
pierces
what
he
has
got
to
follow
directly
*NL*
into
Mr.

with
the
thumb-nail
already
mentioned

Mr.

draws
himself
up
again

looks
triumphantly
at

would
be
glad
to
know
how
he
feels
after
that

``

says
Mr.

hitting
him
again
.

The
present
effect
of
this
flight
of
oratory
--
much
admired
for
its
*NL*
general
power
by
Mr.
Chadband
's
followers
--
being
not
only
to
make
Mr.
*NL*
Chadband
unpleasantly
warm
,
but
to
represent
the
innocent
Mr.
Snagsby
*NL*
in
the
light
of
a
determined
enemy
to
virtue
,
with
a
forehead
of

brass
and
a
heart
of
adamant
,
that
unfortunate
tradesman

more
disconcerted

``

he
resumes
after
dabbing
his

it
smokes
to
such
an

he
seems
to

the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Jo
has
been
standing
on
the
spot
where
he
woke
up
,
ever
*NL*
picking
his
cap
and
putting
bits
of
fur
in
his
mouth
.
He
spits
them
*NL*
out
with
a
remorseful
air
,
for
he
feels
that
it
is
in
his
nature
to
*NL*
be
an
unimprovable
reprobate
and
that
it
's
no
good
HIS
trying
to
keep
*NL*
awake
,
for
HE
wo
n't
never
know
nothink
.
Though
it
may
be
,
Jo
,
that
*NL*
there
is
a
history
so
interesting
and
affecting
even
to
minds
as
near
*NL*
the
brutes
as
thine
,
recording
deeds
done
on
this
earth
for
common
*NL*
men
,
that
if
the
Chadbands
,
removing
their
own
persons
from
the
*NL*
light
,
would
but
show
it
thee
in
simple
reverence
,
would
but
leave
it
*NL*
unimproved
,
would
but
regard
it
as
being
eloquent
enough
without
*NL*
their
modest
aid
--
it
might
hold
thee
awake
,
and
thou
might
learn
from
*NL*
it
yet
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
never
heard
of
any
such
book
.
Its
compilers
and
the
Reverend
*NL*
Chadband
are
all
one
to
him
,
except
that
he
knows
the
Reverend
*NL*
Chadband
and
would
rather
run
away
from
him
for
an
hour
than
hear
him
*NL*
talk
for
five
minutes
.
``
It
a
n't
no
good
my
waiting
here
no
longer
,
''
*NL*
thinks
Jo
.
``
Mr.
Snagsby
a
n't
a-going
to
say
nothink
to
me
to-night
.
''
*NL*
And
downstairs
he
shuffles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
downstairs
is
the
charitable
Guster
,
holding
by
the
handrail
of
*NL*
the
kitchen
stairs
and
warding
off
a
fit
,
as
yet
doubtfully
,
the
same
*NL*
having
been
induced
by
Mrs.
Snagsby
's
screaming
.
She
has
her
own
*NL*
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
to
hand
to
Jo
,
with
whom
she
ventures
to
*NL*
interchange
a
word
or
so
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
something
to
eat
,
poor
boy
,
''
says
Guster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
`
ee
,
mum
,
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
hungry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jist
!
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
gone
of
your
father
and
your
mother
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
stops
in
the
middle
of
a
bite
and
looks
petrified
.
For
this
orphan
*NL*
charge
of
the
Christian
saint
whose
shrine
was
at
Tooting
has
patted
*NL*
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
it
is
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
any
*NL*
decent
hand
has
been
so
laid
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
know
'd
nothink
about
'em
,
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
did
n't
I
of
mine
,
''
cries
Guster
.
She
is
repressing
symptoms
*NL*
favourable
to
the
fit
when
she
seems
to
take
alarm
at
something
and
*NL*
vanishes
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
''
whispers
the
law-stationer
softly
as
the
boy
lingers
on
the
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
Mr.
Snagsby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
you
were
gone
--
there
's
another
half-crown
,
Jo
.
It
was
*NL*
quite
right
of
you
to
say
nothing
about
the
lady
the
other
night
when
*NL*
we
were
out
together
.
It
would
breed
trouble
.
You
ca
n't
be
too
quiet
,
*NL*
Jo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
fly
,
master
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ghostly
shade
,
frilled
and
night-capped
,
follows
the
law-stationer
*NL*
to
the
room
he
came
from
and
glides
higher
up
.
And
henceforth
he
*NL*
begins
,
go
where
he
will
,
to
be
attended
by
another
shadow
than
his
*NL*
own
,
hardly
less
constant
than
his
own
,
hardly
less
quiet
than
his
*NL*
own
.
And
into
whatsoever
atmosphere
of
secrecy
his
own
shadow
may
*NL*
pass
,
let
all
concerned
in
the
secrecy
beware
!
For
the
watchful
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
is
there
too
--
bone
of
his
bone
,
flesh
of
his
flesh
,
shadow
of
*NL*
his
shadow
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Sharpshooters
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Wintry
morning
,
looking
with
dull
eyes
and
sallow
face
upon
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Leicester
Square
,
finds
its
inhabitants
unwilling
to
*NL*
get
out
of
bed
.
Many
of
them
are
not
early
risers
at
the
brightest
of
*NL*
times
,
being
birds
of
night
who
roost
when
the
sun
is
high
and
are
*NL*
wide
awake
and
keen
for
prey
when
the
stars
shine
out
.
Behind
dingy
*NL*
blind
and
curtain
,
in
upper
story
and
garret
,
skulking
more
or
less
*NL*
under
false
names
,
false
hair
,
false
titles
,
false
jewellery
,
and
*NL*
false
histories
,
a
colony
of
brigands
lie
in
their
first
sleep
.
*NL*
Gentlemen
of
the
green-baize
road
who
could
discourse
from
personal
*NL*
experience
of
foreign
galleys
and
home
treadmills
;
spies
of
strong
*NL*
governments
that
eternally
quake
with
weakness
and
miserable
fear
,
*NL*
broken
traitors
,
cowards
,
bullies
,
gamesters
,
shufflers
,
swindlers
,
*NL*
and
false
witnesses
;
some
not
unmarked
by
the
branding-iron
beneath
*NL*
their
dirty
braid
;
all
with
more
cruelty
in
them
than
was
in
Nero
,
*NL*
and
more
crime
than
is
in
Newgate
.
For
howsoever
bad
the
devil
can
be
*NL*
in
fustian
or
smock-frock
-LRB-
and
he
can
be
very
bad
in
both
-RRB-
,
he
is
a
*NL*
more
designing
,
callous
,
and
intolerable
devil
when
he
sticks
a
pin
*NL*
in
his
shirt-front
,
calls
himself
a
gentleman
,
backs
a
card
or
*NL*
colour
,
plays
a
game
or
so
of
billiards
,
and
knows
a
little
about
*NL*
bills
and
promissory
notes
than
in
any
other
form
he
wears
.
And
in
*NL*
such
form
Mr.
Bucket
shall
find
him
,
when
he
will
,
still
pervading
*NL*
the
tributary
channels
of
Leicester
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
wintry
morning
wants
him
not
and
wakes
him
not
.
It
wakes
Mr.
*NL*
George
of
the
shooting
gallery
and
his
familiar
.
They
arise
,
roll
up
*NL*
and
stow
away
their
mattresses
.
Mr.
George
,
having
shaved
himself
*NL*
before
a
looking-glass
of
minute
proportions
,
then
marches
out
,
*NL*
bare-headed
and
bare-chested
,
to
the
pump
in
the
little
yard
and
anon
*NL*
comes
back
shining
with
yellow
soap
,
friction
,
drifting
rain
,
and
*NL*
exceedingly
cold
water
.
As
he
rubs
himself
upon
a
large
jack-towel
,
*NL*
blowing
like
a
military
sort
of
diver
just
come
up
,
his
hair
curling
*NL*
tighter
and
tighter
on
his
sunburnt
temples
the
more
he
rubs
it
so
*NL*
that
it
looks
as
if
it
never
could
be
loosened
by
any
less
coercive
*NL*
instrument
than
an
iron
rake
or
a
curry-comb
--
as
he
rubs
,
and
puffs
,
*NL*
and
polishes
,
and
blows
,
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
the
more
*NL*
conveniently
to
excoriate
his
throat
,
and
standing
with
his
body
well
*NL*
bent
forward
to
keep
the
wet
from
his
martial
legs
,
Phil
,
on
his
*NL*
knees
lighting
a
fire
,
looks
round
as
if
it
were
enough
washing
for
*NL*
him
to
see
all
that
done
,
and
sufficient
renovation
for
one
day
to
*NL*
take
in
the
superfluous
health
his
master
throws
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
George
is
dry
,
he
goes
to
work
to
brush
his
head
with
two
*NL*
hard
brushes
at
once
,
to
that
unmerciful
degree
that
Phil
,
*NL*
shouldering
his
way
round
the
gallery
in
the
act
of
sweeping
it
,
*NL*
winks
with
sympathy
.
This
chafing
over
,
the
ornamental
part
of
Mr.
*NL*
George
's
toilet
is
soon
performed
.
He
fills
his
pipe
,
lights
it
,
and
*NL*
marches
up
and
down
smoking
,
as
his
custom
is
,
while
Phil
,
raising
a
*NL*
powerful
odour
of
hot
rolls
and
coffee
,
prepares
breakfast
.
He
smokes
*NL*
gravely
and
marches
in
slow
time
.
Perhaps
this
morning
's
pipe
is
*NL*
devoted
to
the
memory
of
Gridley
in
his
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
Phil
,
''
says
George
of
the
shooting
gallery
after
several
*NL*
turns
in
silence
,
``
you
were
dreaming
of
the
country
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
,
by
the
by
,
said
as
much
in
a
tone
of
surprise
as
he
scrambled
*NL*
out
of
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
guv
`
ner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
what
it
was
like
,
guv
`
ner
,
''
said
Phil
,
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
it
was
the
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
account
of
the
grass
,
I
think
.
And
the
swans
upon
it
,
''
says
Phil
*NL*
after
further
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
the
swans
doing
on
the
grass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
was
a-eating
of
it
,
I
expect
,
''
says
Phil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
resumes
his
march
,
and
the
man
resumes
his
preparation
of
*NL*
breakfast
.
It
is
not
necessarily
a
lengthened
preparation
,
being
*NL*
limited
to
the
setting
forth
of
very
simple
breakfast
requisites
for
*NL*
two
and
the
broiling
of
a
rasher
of
bacon
at
the
fire
in
the
rusty
*NL*
grate
;
but
as
Phil
has
to
sidle
round
a
considerable
part
of
the
*NL*
gallery
for
every
object
he
wants
,
and
never
brings
two
objects
at
*NL*
once
,
it
takes
time
under
the
circumstances
.
At
length
the
breakfast
*NL*
is
ready
.
Phil
announcing
it
,
Mr.
George
knocks
the
ashes
out
of
his
*NL*
pipe
on
the
hob
,
stands
his
pipe
itself
in
the
chimney
corner
,
and
*NL*
sits
down
to
the
meal
.
When
he
has
helped
himself
,
Phil
follows
suit
,
*NL*
sitting
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
little
oblong
table
and
taking
his
*NL*
plate
on
his
knees
.
Either
in
humility
,
or
to
hide
his
blackened
*NL*
hands
,
or
because
it
is
his
natural
manner
of
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
country
,
''
says
Mr.
George
,
plying
his
knife
and
fork
;
``
why
,
I
*NL*
suppose
you
never
clapped
your
eyes
on
the
country
,
Phil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
the
marshes
once
,
''
says
Phil
,
contentedly
eating
his
*NL*
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
marshes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
THE
marshes
,
commander
,
''
returns
Phil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
they
are
,
''
says
Phil
;
``
but
I
see
'em
,
guv
`
ner
.
*NL*
They
was
flat
.
And
miste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Governor
and
commander
are
interchangeable
terms
with
Phil
,
*NL*
expressive
of
the
same
respect
and
deference
and
applicable
to
nobody
*NL*
but
Mr.
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
born
in
the
country
,
Phil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
you
indeed
,
commander

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

And

''
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
elevates
his
one
eyebrow
,
and
after
respectfully
staring
at
his
*NL*
master
to
express
interest
,
swallows
a
great
gulp
of
coffee
,
still
*NL*
staring
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
a

note

says
Mr.

``
Not

says
Mr.

asks
the

pausing

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
slowly
putting
down
his
saucer
without
tasting
its
*NL*
contents
,
is
laughingly
beginning
,
``
Why

when

he
stops
,
seeing
that
Phil
is
counting
on
his
dirty
fingers

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Phil

Clerkenwell
together

That
was
April
Fool
Day

I
was
able
to
count
up
*NL*
to
ten
;
and
when
April
Fool
Day
come
round
again
,
I
says
to
myself

April
Fool

after

that

I
says

old

you
're
two
and

In

course

time
,
I
come
to
ten
and
a
eight
in
it
;
two
tens
and
a
eight
*NL*
in
it

When
it
got
so
high
,
it
got
the
upper
hand
of
me
,

this
is
*NL*
how
I
always
know
there
's
a
eight
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
says
Mr.
George
,
resuming
his
breakfast
.
``
And
where
's
the
*NL*
tinker
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

put

Phil
replies
mysteriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
that
means
you
got
promotion
?
Took
the
business
,
Phil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
commander
,
I
took
the
business
.
Such
as
it
was

It
was
n't
much
*NL*
of
a
beat
--
round
Saffron
Hill
,
Hatton
Garden
,
Clerkenwell
,
Smiffeld
,
*NL*
and
there
--
poor
neighbourhood
,
where
they
uses
up
the
kettles
till
*NL*
they
're
past
mending
.
Most
of
the
tramping
tinkers
used
to
come
and
*NL*
lodge
at
our
place
;
that
was
the
best
part
of
my
master
's
earnings
.
*NL*
But
they
did
n't
come
to
me
.
I
war
n't
like
him
.
He
could
sing
'em
a
*NL*
good
song
.
I
could
n't
!
He
could
play
'em
a
tune
on
any
sort
of
pot
*NL*
you
please
,
so
as
it
was
iron
or
block
tin
.
I
never
could
do
nothing
*NL*
with
a
pot
but
mend
it
or
bile
it
--
never
had
a
note
of
music
in
me
.
*NL*
Besides
,
I
was
too
ill-looking
,
and
their
wives
complained
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
mighty
particular
.
You
would
pass
muster
in

crowd

says
the
trooper
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
guv

,
''
returns
Phil
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
No
,
I
should
n't

I
*NL*
was
passable
enough
when
I
went
with
the
tinker
,
though
nothing
to
*NL*
boast
of
then
;
but
what
with
blowing
the
fire
with
my
mouth
when
I
*NL*
was
young
,
and
spileing
my
complexion
,
and
singeing
my
hair
off
,
and
*NL*
swallering
the
smoke
,
and
what
with
being
nat

unfort

nate
in
*NL*
the
way
of
running
against
hot
metal
and
marking
myself
by

*NL*
means
,
and
what
with
having
turn-ups
with
the
tinker
as
I
got
older
,
*NL*
almost
whenever
he
was
too
far
gone
in
drink
--
which
was
almost
*NL*
always
--
my
beauty
was
queer
,
wery
queer
,
even
at
that
time
.
As
to
*NL*
since
,
what
with
a
dozen
years
in
a
dark
forge
where
the
men
was
*NL*
given
to
larking
,
and
what
with
being
scorched
in
a
accident
at
a
*NL*
gas-works
,
and
what
with
being
blowed
out
of
winder
case-filling
at
*NL*
the
firework
business
,
I
am
ugly
enough
to
be
made
a
show
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
Resigning
himself
to
which
condition
with
a
perfectly
satisfied
*NL*
manner
,
Phil
begs
the
favour
of
another
cup
of
coffee
.
While
drinking
*NL*
it
,
he
says
,
``
It
was
after
the
case-filling
blow-up
when
I
first
see

You
remember

*NL*
*NL*

cries
Phil

putting
down

and
hastily
removing
his

from
his
knees
,
``

says
to

I
did
n't
say
much
to
*NL*

then
,
for
I
was
took
by
surprise
that
a

healthy

bold
as

stop
to
speak

you

out

''
cries
Phil
,
who
has
*NL*
started
from
his
chair
and
unaccountably
begun
to
sidle
away
.
``
If

*NL*
With
this
unexpected
speech
,
energetically
delivered
and
accompanied
*NL*
by
action
illustrative
of
the
various
exercises
referred
to
,
Phil
*NL*
Squod
shoulders
his
way
round
three
sides
of
the
gallery
,
and
*NL*
abruptly
tacking
off
at
his
commander
,
makes
a
butt
at
him
with
his
*NL*
head
,
intended
to
express
devotion
to
his
service
.
He
then
begins
to
*NL*
clear
away
the
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
,
after
laughing
cheerfully
and
clapping
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
assists
in
these
arrangements
and
helps
to
get
the
gallery
*NL*
into
business
order
.
That
done
,
he
takes
a
turn
at
the
dumb-bells
,
*NL*
and
afterwards
weighing
himself
and
opining
that
he
is
getting
``
too
*NL*
fleshy
,
''
engages
with
great
gravity
in
solitary
broadsword
practice
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
Phil
has
fallen
to
work
at
his
usual
table
,
where
he
screws
*NL*
and
unscrews
,
and
cleans
,
and
files
,
and
whistles
into
small
*NL*
apertures
,
and
blackens
himself
more
and
more
,
and
seems
to
do
and
*NL*
undo
everything
that
can
be
done
and
undone
about
a
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
and
man
are
at
length
disturbed
by
footsteps
in
the
passage
,
*NL*
where
they
make
an
unusual
sound
,
denoting
the
arrival
of
unusual
*NL*
company
.
These
steps
,
advancing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
gallery
,
*NL*
bring
into
it
a
group
at
first
sight
scarcely
reconcilable
with
any
*NL*
day
in
the
year
but
the
fifth
of
November
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
consists
of
a
limp
and
ugly
figure
carried
in
a
chair
by
two
*NL*
bearers
and
attended
by
a
lean
female
with
a
face
like
a
pinched
*NL*
mask
,
who
might
be
expected
immediately
to
recite
the
popular
verses
*NL*
commemorative
of
the
time
when
they
did
contrive
to
blow
Old
England
*NL*
up
alive
but
for
her
keeping
her
lips
tightly
and
defiantly
closed
as
*NL*
the
chair
is
put
down
.
At
which
point
the
figure
in
it
gasping
,
``
O
*NL*
Lord
!
Oh
,
dear
me
!
I
am
shaken
!
''
adds
,
``
How
de
do

*NL*

''
Mr.
George
then
descries
,
in
the
procession
,
the
*NL*
venerable
Mr.
Smallweed
out
for
an
airing
,
attended
by
his
*NL*
granddaughter
Judy
as
body-guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Grandfather
Smallweed
,
removing

his
right
arm
from
the
neck
of
one
of
his
bearers
,
whom
he
has
nearly
*NL*
throttled
coming
along
,
``

Mr.
Smallweed
.
``

have

been

many
months

It

longed

so
much

*NL*

*NL*
``

Mr.

him
by

both
hands

brought

*NL*
``

bears

calmly

mutters
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
got
a
hackney-cab

put

it

just
round

corner
they
lifted
me
out
of

cab

into

chair

carried

alluding
to

withdraws
adjusting

refers
to

with
a
glance
of
considerable

terror
and
a
half-subdued
``

Nor
in

on

surface

without

for

Phil
,
who
has
never

the
apparition
in
the
black-velvet
cap

has
stopped
short
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
with
much
of
the
air

of
a
dead
shot
intent
on
picking
Mr.

off
as
an

old

bird
of
the

species

The

that
spring
up
spontaneously
in
the
western
streets

ready
dressed

tosses
the

over-handed

His
closing
exclamation
is
jerked
out
of
the
venerable

by

the
suddenness
with
which
Mr.

like

up

all

empty-handed

Mr.

reassured

falls
to

rubbing
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

says
to

standing

about

in

apart
to

takes
a
step
or
two
away
to
lay
it
aside

Mr.

returning

folds
his

looking
down
at
the

man
,
sliding
every

lower
and
lower
in
his
chair

says
quietly
,
*NL*
``
Now

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

rubbing
his

with
an
artful
chuckle

Yes

*NL*

says
Mr.

who
with
great
composure
sets
his

chair
in
the
chimney-corner
,
takes
his
pipe
from
the
grate
,
fills
it
*NL*
and
lights
it
,
and
falls
to
smoking
peacefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
tends
to
the
discomfiture
of
Mr.
Smallweed
,
who
finds
it
so
*NL*
difficult
to
resume
his
object
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
that
he
becomes
*NL*
exasperated
and
secretly
claws
the
air
with
an
impotent
*NL*
vindictiveness
expressive
of
an
intense
desire
to
tear
and
rend
the
*NL*
visage
of
Mr.

.
As
the
excellent
old
gentleman
's
nails
are
long
*NL*
and
leaden
,
and
his
hands
lean
and
veinous
,
and
his
eyes
green
and
*NL*
watery
;
and
,
over

above
this
,
as
he
continues
,
while
he
claws
,
to
*NL*
slide
down
in
his
chair
and
to
collapse
into
a
shapeless
bundle
,
he
*NL*
becomes
such
a
ghastly
spectacle
,
even
in
the
accustomed
eyes
of
*NL*
Judy
,
that
that
young
virgin
pounces
at
him
with
something
more
than
*NL*
the
ardour
of
affection
and
so
shakes
him
up
and
pats
and
pokes
him
*NL*
in
divers
parts
of
his
body
,
but
particularly
in
that
part
which
the
*NL*
science
of
self-defence
would
call
his
wind

that
in
his
grievous
*NL*
distress
he
utters
enforced
sounds
like
a
paviour

rammer

*NL*
*NL*
When
Judy
has
by

set
him
up
again

white

stretches
out

The

raising

makes
another

having
thus

,
without
charging
for
it
?
''
Mr.
George
inquires
,
*NL*
getting
his
hat
and
thick
wash-leather
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pleasantry
so
tickles
Mr.
Smallweed
that
he
laughs
,
long
and
*NL*
low
,
before
the
fire
.
But
ever
while
he
laughs
,
he
glances
over
his
*NL*
paralytic
shoulder
at
Mr.
George
and
eagerly
watches
him
as
he
*NL*
unlocks
the
padlock
of
a
homely
cupboard
at
the
distant
end
of
the
*NL*
gallery
,
looks
here
and
there
upon
the
higher
shelves
,
and
ultimately
*NL*
takes
something
out
with
a
rustling
of
paper
,
folds
it
,
and
puts
it
*NL*
in
his
breast
.
Then
Judy
pokes
Mr.
Smallweed
once
,
and
Mr.
Smallweed
*NL*
pokes
Judy
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
coming
back
.
``
Phil
,
you
can
carry
*NL*
this
old
gentleman
to
his
coach
,
and
make
nothing
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
!
O
Lord
!
Stop
a
moment
!
''
says
Mr.
Smallweed
.
``
He
's
so
*NL*
very
prompt
!
Are
you
sure
you
can
do
it
carefully
,
my
worthy
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
makes
no
reply
,
but
seizing
the
chair
and
its
load
,
sidles
away
,
*NL*
tightly
hugged
by
the
now
speechless
Mr.
Smallweed
,
and
bolts
along
*NL*
the
passage
as
if
he
had
an
acceptable
commission
to
carry
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
to
the
nearest
volcano
.
His
shorter
trust
,
however
,
*NL*
terminating
at
the
cab
,
he
deposits
him
there
;
and
the
fair
Judy
*NL*
takes
her
place
beside
him
,
and
the
chair
embellishes
the
roof
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
George
takes
the
vacant
place
upon
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
is
quite
confounded
by
the
spectacle
he
beholds
from
time
*NL*
to
time
as
he
peeps
into
the
cab
through
the
window
behind
him
,
where
*NL*
the
grim
Judy
is
always
motionless
,
and
the
old
gentleman
with
his
*NL*
cap
over
one
eye
is
always
sliding
off
the
seat
into
the
straw
and
*NL*
looking
upward
at
him
out
of
his
other
eye
with
a
helpless
expression
*NL*
of
being
jolted
in
the
back
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
More
Old
Soldiers
Than
One
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
has
not
far
to
ride
with
folded
arms
upon
the
box
,
for
*NL*
their
destination
is
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
.
When
the
driver
stops
his
*NL*
horses
,
Mr.
George
alights
,
and
looking
in
at
the
window
,
says
,
*NL*
``
What
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
your
man
,
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
friend
.
Do
you
know
him
,
Mr.
George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
have
heard
of
him
--
seen
him
too
,
I
think
.
But
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
him
,
and
he
do
n't
know
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
ensues
the
carrying
of
Mr.
Smallweed
upstairs
,
which
is
done
to
*NL*
perfection
with
the
trooper
's
help
.
He
is
borne
into
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
's
great
room
and
deposited
on
the
Turkey
rug
before
the
*NL*
fire
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
not
within
at
the
present
moment
but
will
be
*NL*
back
directly
.
The
occupant
of
the
pew
in
the
hall
,
having
said
thus
*NL*
much
,
stirs
the
fire
and
leaves
the
triumvirate
to
warm
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
is
mightily
curious
in
respect
of
the
room
.
He
looks
up
at
*NL*
the
painted
ceiling
,
looks
round
at
the
old
law-books
,
contemplates
*NL*
the
portraits
of
the
great
clients
,
reads
aloud
the
names
on
the
*NL*
boxes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
'
''
Mr.
George
reads
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
``
Ha
!
`
Manor
of
Chesney
Wold
.
'
Humph
!
''
Mr.
George
stands
looking
at
*NL*
these
boxes
a
long
while
--
as
if
they
were
pictures
--
and
comes
back
to
*NL*
the
fire
repeating
,
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
and
Manor
of
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worth
a
mint
of
money
,
Mr.
George
!
''
whispers
Grandfather
Smallweed
,
*NL*
rubbing
his
legs
.
``
Powerfully
rich
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
mean
?
This
old
gentleman
,
or
the
Baronet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
gentleman
,
this
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
heard
;
and
knows
a
thing
or
two
,
I
'll
hold
a
wager
.
Not
*NL*
bad
quarters
,
either
,
''
says
Mr.
George
,
looking
round
again
.
``
See
the
*NL*
strong-box
yonder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reply
is
cut
short
by
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
arrival
.
There
is
no
*NL*
change
in
him
,
of
course
.
Rustily
drest
,
with
his
spectacles
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
their
very
case
worn
threadbare
.
In
manner
,
close
and
dry
.
*NL*
In
voice
,
husky
and
low
.
In
face
,
watchful
behind
a
blind
;
habitually
*NL*
not
uncensorious
and
contemptuous
perhaps
.
The
peerage
may
have
*NL*
warmer
worshippers
and
faithfuller
believers
than
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
*NL*
after
all
,
if
everything
were
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Mr.
Smallweed
,
good
morning
!
''
he
says
as
he
comes
in
.
*NL*
``
You
have
brought
the
sergeant
,
I
see
.
Sit
down
,
sergeant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
takes
off
his
gloves
and
puts
them
in
his
hat
,
he
*NL*
looks
with
half-closed
eyes
across
the
room
to
where
the
trooper
*NL*
stands
and
says
within
himself
perchance
,
``
You
'll
do
,
my
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
sergeant
,
''
he
repeats
as
he
comes
to
his
table
,
which
is
*NL*
set
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
and
takes
his
easy-chair
.
``
Cold
and
raw
*NL*
this
morning
,
cold
and
raw
!
''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
warms
before
the
bars
,
*NL*
alternately
,
the
palms
and
knuckles
of
his
hands
and
looks
-LRB-
from
*NL*
behind
that
blind
which
is
always
down
-RRB-
at
the
trio
sitting
in
a
*NL*
little
semicircle
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
can
feel
what
I
am
about
''
-LRB-
as
perhaps
he
can
in
two
senses
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
Smallweed
.
''
The
old
gentleman
is
newly
shaken
up
by
Judy
to
bear
*NL*
his
part
in
the
conversation
.
``
You
have
brought
our
good
friend
the
*NL*
sergeant
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
returns
Mr.
Smallweed
,
very
servile
to
the
lawyer
's
*NL*
wealth
and
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
the
sergeant
say
about
this
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
George
,
''
says
Grandfather
Smallweed
with
a
tremulous
wave
of
his
*NL*
shrivelled
hand
,
``
this
is
the
gentleman
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
salutes
the
gentleman
but
otherwise
sits
bolt
upright
and
*NL*
profoundly
silent
--
very
forward
in
his
chair
,
as
if
the
full
*NL*
complement
of
regulation
appendages
for
a
field-day
hung
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
proceeds
,
``
Well
,
George
--
I
believe
your
name
is
*NL*
George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
,
Sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
returns
the
trooper
,
``
but
I
should
wish
to
*NL*
know
what
YOU
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
in
point
of
reward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
in
point
of
everything
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
so
very
trying
to
Mr.
Smallweed
's
temper
that
he
suddenly
*NL*
breaks
out
with
``
You
're
a
brimstone
beast
!
''
and
as
suddenly
asks
*NL*
pardon
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
excusing
himself
for
this
slip
of
the
*NL*
tongue
by
saying
to
Judy
,
``
I
was
thinking
of
your
grandmother
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
supposed
,
sergeant
,
''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
resumes
as
he
leans
on
one
*NL*
side
of
his
chair
and
crosses
his
legs
,
``
that
Mr.
Smallweed
might
*NL*
have
sufficiently
explained
the
matter
.
It
lies
in
the
smallest
*NL*
compass
,
however
.
You
served
under
Captain
Hawdon
at
one
time
,
and
*NL*
were
his
attendant
in
illness
,
and
rendered
him
many
little
services
,
*NL*
and
were
rather
in
his
confidence
,
I
am
told
.
That
is
so
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

that
is
so
,
''
says
Mr.
George
with
military
brevity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
you
may
happen
to
have
in
your
possession
*NL*
something

anything

in

cries
Grandfather

screwing
up
his

eyes

*NL*
``

much

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
sits
squared
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
,
looks
at
the
*NL*
painted
ceiling
,
and
says
never
a
word
.
The
irascible
Mr.
Smallweed
*NL*
scratches
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
is
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
in
his
methodical
,
subdued
,
*NL*
uninterested
way

``
first

whether

*NL*
``
Thirdly

you

all
like

*NL*
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
suddenly
handing
him
some
sheets
of
written

paper
tied
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

repeats
Mr.

.
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
repetitions
Mr.
George
pronounces
in
a
mechanical
manner
,
*NL*
looking
straight
at
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
;
nor
does
he
so
much
as
glance
at
*NL*
the
affidavit
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
,
that
has
been
given
to
him
*NL*
for
his
inspection
-LRB-
though
he
still
holds
it
in
his
hand
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
continues
to
look
at
the
lawyer
with
an
air
of
troubled
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
replies
Mr.
George
,
rising
erect
and
looking
immense
,
``
I
*NL*
would
rather
,
if
you
'll
excuse
me
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
outwardly
quite
undisturbed
,
demands
,
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
returns
the
trooper
.
``
Except
on
military
compulsion
,
I
am
*NL*
not
a
man
of
business
.
Among
civilians
I
am
what
they
call
in
*NL*
Scotland
a
ne'er
-
do-weel
.
I
have
no
head
for
papers
,
sir
.
I
can
stand
*NL*
any
fire
better
than
a
fire
of
cross
questions
.
I
mentioned
to
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
,
only
an
hour
or
so
ago
,
that
when
I
come
into
things
of
*NL*
this
kind
I
feel
as
if
I
was
being
smothered
.
And
that
is
my
*NL*
sensation
,
''
says
Mr.
George
,
looking
round
upon
the
company
,
``
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
he
takes
three
strides
forward
to
replace
the
papers
on
*NL*
the
lawyer
's
table
and
three
strides
backward
to
resume
his
former
*NL*
station
,
where
he
stands
perfectly
upright
,
now
looking
at
the
ground
*NL*
and
now
at
the
painted
ceiling
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
as
if
to
*NL*
prevent
himself
from
accepting
any
other
document
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
this
provocation
,
Mr.
Smallweed
's
favourite
adjective
of
*NL*
disparagement
is
so
close
to
his
tongue
that
he
begins
the
words
``
my
*NL*
dear
friend
''
with
the
monosyllable
``
brim
,
''
thus
converting
the
*NL*
possessive
pronoun
into
brimmy
and
appearing
to
have
an
impediment
in
*NL*
his
speech
.
Once
past
this
difficulty
,
however
,
he
exhorts
his
dear
*NL*
friend
in
the
tenderest
manner
not
to
be
rash
,
but
to
do
what
so
*NL*
eminent
a
gentleman
requires
,
and
to
do
it
with
a
good
grace
,
*NL*
confident
that
it
must
be
unobjectionable
as
well
as
profitable
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
merely
utters
an
occasional
sentence
,
as
,
``
You
are
the
*NL*
best
judge
of
your
own
interest
,
sergeant
.
''
``
Take
care
you
do
no
harm
*NL*
by
this
.
''
``
Please
yourself
,
please
yourself
.
''
``
If
you
know
what
you
*NL*
mean
,
that
's
quite
enough
.
''
These
he
utters
with
an
appearance
of
*NL*
perfect
indifference
as
he
looks
over
the
papers
on
his
table
and
*NL*
prepares
to
write
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
looks
distrustfully
from
the
painted
ceiling
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
from
the
ground
to
Mr.
Smallweed
,
from
Mr.
Smallweed
to
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
,
and
from
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
to
the
painted
ceiling
again
,
*NL*
often
in
his
perplexity
changing
the
leg
on
which
he
rests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
,
''
says
Mr.
George
,
``
not
to
say
it
offensively

I
am
not
a
match
for
you
*NL*
gentlemen

Will
you
allow
me
to
ask
why
you
want
to
see
the
captain
's
*NL*
hand
,
in
the
case
that
I
could
find
any
specimen
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
quietly
shakes
his
head
.
``
No
.
If
you
were
a
man

you
would
not
need
to

confidential
reasons

very
harmless
in
themselves

for
many
such
*NL*
wants
in
the
profession
to
which
I
belong
.
But
if
you
are
afraid
of
*NL*
doing
any
injury
to
Captain
Hawdon
,
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
*NL*
about
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
He
is
dead
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
IS
he

''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
quietly
sits
down
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
looking
into
his
hat
after
another
*NL*
disconcerted
pause
,
``
I
am
sorry
not
to
have
given
you
more

satisfaction

If
it

any

rather
have
nothing

to
do
with
this
by
a

mine

has
a
better
head
for
*NL*
business
than
I
have
,

who
is
an
old
soldier
,
I
am
willing
to
*NL*
consult
with
him

I
--
I
really
am
so
completely
smothered
myself
at

present

says
Mr.
George
,
passing
his
hand
hopelessly
across
his
*NL*
brow
,
``
that
I
do
n't
know
but
what
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Smallweed
,
hearing
that
this
authority
is
an
old
soldier
,
so
*NL*
strongly
inculcates
the
expediency
of
the
trooper
's
taking
counsel
*NL*
with
him
,
and
particularly
informing
him
of
its
being
a
question
of
*NL*
five
guineas
or
more
,
that
Mr.
George
engages
to
go
and
see
him
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
says
nothing
either
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
consult
my
friend
,
then
,
by
your
leave
,
sir
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
*NL*
``
and
I
'll
take
the
liberty
of
looking
in
again
with
the
final
answer
*NL*
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
Mr.
Smallweed
,
if
you
wish
to
be
carried
*NL*
downstairs

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a

Will
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir

Do
n't
hurry
yourself
on
my
account

''
The
trooper
*NL*
retires
to
a
distant
part
of
the
room
and
resumes
his
curious
*NL*
inspection
of
the
boxes
,
strong
and
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
was
n't
as
weak
as
a

baby

whispers
Grandfather
*NL*
Smallweed
,
drawing
the
lawyer
down
to
his
level
by
the
lapel
of
his
*NL*
coat
and
flashing
some
half-quenched
green
fire
out
of
his
angry
*NL*
eyes
,
``
I
'd
tear
the
writing
away
from
him

's
got

buttoned
in

his
breast

saw
him
put
it
there

Judy
saw
him
put

there

Speak
*NL*
up

you
crabbed
image
for
the
sign
of
a
walking-stick
shop
,
and
say
*NL*
you
saw
him
put
it
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
vehement
conjuration
the
old
gentleman
accompanies
with
such
a
*NL*
thrust
at
his
granddaughter
that
it
is
too
much
for
his
strength
,
and
*NL*
he
slips
away
out
of
his
chair
,
drawing
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
with
him
,
*NL*
until
he
is
arrested
by
Judy
,
and
well
shaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Violence
will
not
do
for

Mr.
Tulkinghorn
then
*NL*
remarks
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

I

But
it

it
's
worse
than

smattering

to
the
imperturbable

only
looks
at

my

Mr.

says
Grandfather
Smallweed
,
winking
at
*NL*
the
lawyer
hideously
as
he
releases
him
,
``
I
am
ready
for
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
with
some
shadowy
sign
of
amusement
manifesting
*NL*
itself
through
his
self-possession
,
stands
on
the
hearth-rug
with
his
*NL*
back
to
the
fire
,
watching
the
disappearance
of
Mr.
Smallweed
and
*NL*
acknowledging
the
trooper
's
parting
salute
with
one
slight
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
more
difficult
to
get
rid
of
the
old
gentleman
,
Mr.
George
*NL*
finds
,
than
to
bear
a
hand
in
carrying
him
downstairs
,
for
when
he
is
*NL*
replaced
in
his
conveyance
,
he
is
so
loquacious
on
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
guineas
and
retains
such
an
affectionate
hold
of
his
button
--
having
,
*NL*
in
truth
,
a
secret
longing
to
rip
his
coat
open
and
rob
him
--
that
*NL*
some
degree
of
force
is
necessary
on
the
trooper
's
part
to
effect
a
*NL*
separation
.
It
is
accomplished
at
last
,
and
he
proceeds
alone
in
*NL*
quest
of
his
adviser
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
cloisterly
Temple
,
and
by
Whitefriars
-LRB-
there
,
not
without
a
*NL*
glance
at
Hanging-Sword
Alley
,
which
would
seem
to
be
something
in
*NL*
his
way
-RRB-
,
and
by
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
and
Blackfriars
Road
,
Mr.
George
*NL*
sedately
marches
to
a
street
of
little
shops
lying
somewhere
in
that
*NL*
ganglion
of
roads
from
Kent
and
Surrey
,
and
of
streets
from
the
*NL*
bridges
of
London
,
centring
in
the
far-famed
elephant
who
has
lost
*NL*
his
castle
formed
of
a
thousand
four-horse
coaches
to
a
stronger
iron
*NL*
monster
than
he
,
ready
to
chop
him
into
mince-meat
any
day
he
dares
.
*NL*
To
one
of
the
little
shops
in
this
street
,
which
is
a
musician
's
*NL*
shop
,
having
a
few
fiddles
in
the
window
,
and
some
Pan
's
pipes
and
a
*NL*
tambourine
,
and
a
triangle
,
and
certain
elongated
scraps
of
music
,
*NL*
Mr.
George
directs
his
massive
tread
.
And
halting
at
a
few
paces
from
*NL*
it
,
as
he
sees
a
soldierly
looking
woman
,
with
her
outer
skirts
*NL*
tucked
up
,
come
forth
with
a
small
wooden
tub
,
and
in
that
tub
*NL*
commence
a-whisking
and
a-splashing
on
the
margin
of
the
pavement
,
*NL*
Mr.
George
says
to
himself
,
``
She
's
as
usual
,
washing
greens
.
I
never
*NL*
saw
her
,
except
upon
a
baggage-waggon
,
when
she
was
n't
washing
*NL*
greens
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
this
reflection
is
at
all
events
so
occupied
in
*NL*
washing
greens
at
present
that
she
remains
unsuspicious
of
Mr.
*NL*
George
's
approach
until
,
lifting
up
herself
and
her
tub
together
when
*NL*
she
has
poured
the
water
off
into
the
gutter
,
she
finds
him
standing
*NL*
near
her
.
Her
reception
of
him
is
not
flattering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
I
never
see
you
but
I
wish
you
was
a
hundred
mile
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
,
without
remarking
on
this
welcome
,
follows
into
the
*NL*
musical-instrument
shop
,
where
the
lady
places
her
tub
of
greens
upon
*NL*
the
counter
,
and
having
shaken
hands
with
him
,
rests
her
arms
upon
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

she
says
,
``

the

*NL*
good-humouredly
.

*NL*
``
Ah

cries
Mrs.

something
shrilly

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

is
not
at
all
an
ill-looking
woman

Rather
large-boned
,
a
*NL*
little
coarse
in
the
grain
,
and
freckled
by
the
sun
and
wind
which
*NL*
have
tanned
her
hair
upon
the
forehead

healthy
,
wholesome
,

bright-eyed

A
strong

busy

active

honest-faced
woman
of
from

forty-five

fifty

Clean

hardy

so
economically
dressed

-LRB-
though
substantially
-RRB-
that
the
only
article
of
ornament
of
which

stands
possessed

to
be
her
wedding-ring

around

her

finger
has
grown
to

so
large

was
put
on

*NL*
never

off

Mr.

thoughtful

sitting
here
while
Mrs.

is
busy

when
Mr.

*NL*
and
young
Woolwich
opportunely
come
home

Mr.

is
an
*NL*
ex-artilleryman
,
tall
and
upright
,
with
shaggy
eyebrows
and
whiskers
*NL*
like
the
fibres
of
a
coco-nut
,
not
a
hair
upon
his
head
,
and
a
torrid
*NL*
complexion
.
His
voice
,
short
,
deep
,
and
resonant
,
is
not
at
all
*NL*
unlike
the
tones
of
the
instrument
to
which
he
is
devoted
.
Indeed
*NL*
there
may
be
generally
observed
in
him
an
unbending

unyielding
,
*NL*
brass-bound
air

the

*NL*
*NL*
Both
father
and

salute
the
trooper
heartily
.
He
saying
,
in
due
*NL*
season
,
that
he
has
come
to
advise
with
Mr.
Bagnet
,
Mr.
Bagnet
*NL*
hospitably
declares
that
he
will
hear
of
no
business
until
after
*NL*
dinner
and
that
his
friend
shall
not
partake
of
his
counsel
without
*NL*
first
partaking
of
boiled
pork
and
greens
.
The
trooper
yielding
to
*NL*
this
invitation
,
he
and
Mr.
Bagnet
,
not
to
embarrass
the
domestic
*NL*
preparations
,
go
forth
to
take
a
turn
up
and
down
the
little
street
,
*NL*
which
they
promenade
with
measured
tread
and
folded
arms
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a

returns
Mr.

in
short

bassoon-like

I

But
I
never

''
*NL*
*NL*
Proceeding
to
converse
on
indifferent
matters
,
they
walk
up
and
down
*NL*
the
little
street
,
keeping
step
and
time
,
until
summoned
by
Quebec
*NL*
and
Malta
to
do
justice
to
the
pork
and
greens
,
over
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
,
like
a
military
chaplain
,
says
a
short
grace
.
In
the
*NL*
distribution
of
these
comestibles
,
as
in
every
other
household
duty
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
developes
an
exact
system
,
sitting
with
every
dish
before
*NL*
her
,
allotting
to
every
portion
of
pork
its
own
portion
of
*NL*
pot-liquor
,
greens
,
potatoes
,
and
even
mustard
,
and
serving
it
out
*NL*
complete
.
Having
likewise
served
out
the
beer
from
a
can
and
thus
*NL*
supplied
the
mess
with
all
things
necessary
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
proceeds
to
*NL*
satisfy
her
own
hunger
,
which
is
in
a
healthy
state
.
The
kit
of
the
*NL*
mess
,
if
the
table
furniture
may
be
so
denominated
,
is
chiefly
*NL*
composed
of
utensils
of
horn
and
tin
that
have
done
duty
in
several
*NL*
parts
of
the
world
.
Young
Woolwich
's
knife
,
in
particular
,
which
is
*NL*
of
the
oyster
kind
,
with
the
additional
feature
of
a
strong
*NL*
shutting-up
movement
which
frequently
balks
the
appetite
of
that
*NL*
young
musician
,
is
mentioned
as
having
gone
in
various
hands
the
*NL*
complete
round
of
foreign
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
done
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
assisted
by
the
younger
branches
-LRB-
who
*NL*
polish
their
own
cups
and
platters
,
knives
and
forks
-RRB-
,
makes
all
the
*NL*
dinner
garniture
shine
as
brightly
as
before
and
puts
it
all
away
,
*NL*
first
sweeping
the
hearth
,
to
the
end
that
Mr.
Bagnet
and
the
visitor
*NL*
may
not
be
retarded
in
the
smoking
of
their
pipes
.
These
household
*NL*
cares
involve
much
pattening
and
counter-pattening
in
the
backyard
*NL*
and
considerable
use
of
a
pail
,
which
is
finally
so
happy
as
to
*NL*
assist
in
the
ablutions
of
Mrs.
Bagnet
herself
.
That
old
girl
*NL*
reappearing
by
and
by
,
quite
fresh
,
and
sitting
down
to
her
*NL*
needlework
,
then
and
only
then
--
the
greens
being
only
then
to
be
*NL*
considered
as
entirely
off
her
mind
--
Mr.
Bagnet
requests
the
trooper
*NL*
to
state
his
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Mr.
George
does
with
great
discretion
,
appearing
to
address
*NL*
himself
to
Mr.
Bagnet
,
but
having
an
eye
solely
on
the
old
girl
all
*NL*
the
time
,
as
Bagnet
has
himself
.
She
,
equally
discreet
,
busies
*NL*
herself
with
her
needlework
.
The
case
fully
stated
,
Mr.
Bagnet
*NL*
resorts
to
his
standard
artifice
for
the
maintenance
of
discipline
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
whole
of
it
,
is
it
,
George
?
''
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
whole
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
act
according
to
my
opinion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
guided
,
''
replies
George
,
``
entirely
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
girl
,
''
says
Mr.
Bagnet
,
``
give
him
my
opinion
.
You
know
it
.
Tell
*NL*
him
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
that
he
can
not
have
too
little
to
do
with
people
who
are
too
*NL*
deep
for
him
and
can
not
be
too
careful
of
interference
with
matters
*NL*
he
does
not
understand
--
that
the
plain
rule
is
to
do
nothing
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
to
be
a
party
to
nothing
underhanded
or
mysterious
,
and
never
*NL*
to
put
his
foot
where
he
can
not
see
the
ground
.
This
,
in
effect
,
is
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
's
opinion
,
as
delivered
through
the
old
girl
,
and
it
so
*NL*
relieves
Mr.
George
's
mind
by
confirming
his
own
opinion
and
*NL*
banishing
his
doubts
that
he
composes
himself
to
smoke
another
pipe
*NL*
on
that
exceptional
occasion
and
to
have
a
talk
over
old
times
with
*NL*
the
whole
Bagnet
family
,
according
to
their
various
ranges
of
*NL*
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
these
means
it
comes
to
pass
that
Mr.
George
does
not
again
*NL*
rise
to
his
full
height
in
that
parlour
until
the
time
is
drawing
on
*NL*
when
the
bassoon
and
fife
are
expected
by
a
British
public
at
the
*NL*
theatre
;
and
as
it
takes
time
even
then
for
Mr.
George
,
in
his
*NL*
domestic
character
of
Bluffy
,
to
take
leave
of
Quebec
and
Malta
and
*NL*
insinuate
a
sponsorial
shilling
into
the
pocket
of
his
godson
with
*NL*
felicitations
on
his
success
in
life
,
it
is
dark
when
Mr.
George
*NL*
again
turns
his
face
towards
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
family
home
,
''
he
ruminates
as
he
marches
along
,
``
however
small
it
*NL*
is
,
makes
a
man
like
me
look
lonely
.
But
it
's
well
I
never
made
that
*NL*
evolution
of
matrimony
.
I
should
n't
have
been
fit
for
it
.
I
am
such
a
*NL*
vagabond
still
,
even
at
my
present
time
of
life
,
that
I
could
n't
hold
*NL*
to
the
gallery
a
month
together
if
it
was
a
regular
pursuit
or
if
I
*NL*
did
n't
camp
there
,
gipsy
fashion
.
Come
!
I
disgrace
nobody
and
cumber
*NL*
nobody
;
that
's
something
.
I
have
not
done
that
for
many
a
long
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
whistles
it
off
and
marches
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
and
mounting
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
stair
,
*NL*
he
finds
the
outer
door
closed
and
the
chambers
shut
,
but
the
trooper
*NL*
not
knowing
much
about
outer
doors
,
and
the
staircase
being
dark
*NL*
besides
,
he
is
yet
fumbling
and
groping
about
,
hoping
to
discover
a
*NL*
bell-handle
or
to
open
the
door
for
himself
,
when
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
comes
up
the
stairs
-LRB-
quietly
,
of
course
-RRB-
and
angrily
asks
,
``
Who
is
*NL*
that
?
What
are
you
doing
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
could
n't
George

the
sergeant

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

no

I
could
n't

At

says
the
trooper
,
*NL*
rather
nettled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
changed
your
mind
?
Or
are
you
in
the

Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
demands
.
But
he
knows
well
enough
at
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
same
mind
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so

That
's
sufficient
.
You
can
go

So
you
are
the
man

''
*NL*
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
opening
his
door
with
the
key
,
``
in
whose
*NL*
hiding-place
Mr.
Gridley
was
found
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
AM
the
man
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
stopping
two
or
three
stairs
*NL*
down
.
``
What
then
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
I
do
n't
like
your
associates

You
should
not
have
seen

the
inside

I
had
thought

Gridley

A

murderous

dangerous

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
spoken
in
an
unusually
high
tone
for
him
,
the
*NL*
lawyer
goes
into
his
rooms
and
shuts
the
door
with
a
thundering
*NL*
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
takes
his
dismissal
in
great
dudgeon
,
the
greater
because
*NL*
a
clerk
coming
up
the
stairs
has
heard
the
last
words
of
all
and
*NL*
evidently
applies
them
to
him
.
``
A
pretty
character
to
bear
,
''
the
*NL*
trooper
growls
with
a
hasty
oath
as
he
strides
downstairs
.
``
A
*NL*
threatening
,
murderous
,
dangerous
fellow

''
And
looking
up
,
he
sees
*NL*
the
clerk
looking
down
at
him
and
marking
him
as
he
passes
a
lamp
.
*NL*
This
so
intensifies
his
dudgeon
that
for
five
minutes
he
is
in
an
ill
*NL*
humour
.
But
he
whistles
that
off
like
the
rest
of
it
and
marches
home
*NL*
to
the
shooting
gallery

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ironmaster
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
has
got
the
better
,
for
the
time
being
,
of
the
*NL*
family
gout
and
is
once
more
,
in
a
literal
no
less
than
in
a
*NL*
figurative
point
of
view
,
upon
his
legs
.
He
is
at
his
place
in
*NL*
Lincolnshire
;
but
the
waters
are
out
again
on
the
low-lying
grounds
,
*NL*
and
the
cold
and
damp
steal
into
Chesney
Wold
,
though
well
defended
,
*NL*
and
eke
into
Sir
Leicester
's
bones
.
The
blazing
fires
of
faggot
and
*NL*
coal
--
Dedlock
timber
and
antediluvian
forest
--
that
blaze
upon
the
*NL*
broad
wide
hearths
and
wink
in
the
twilight
on
the
frowning
woods
,
*NL*
sullen
to
see
how
trees
are
sacrificed
,
do
not
exclude
the
enemy
.
The
*NL*
hot-water
pipes
that
trail
themselves
all
over
the
house
,
the
*NL*
cushioned
doors
and
windows
,
and
the
screens
and
curtains
fail
to
*NL*
supply
the
fires
'
deficiencies
and
to
satisfy
Sir
Leicester
's
need
.
*NL*
Hence
the
fashionable
intelligence
proclaims
one
morning
to
the
*NL*
listening
earth
that
Lady
Dedlock
is
expected
shortly
to
return
to
*NL*
town
for
a
few
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
melancholy
truth
that
even
great
men
have
their
poor
*NL*
relations
.
Indeed
great
men
have
often
more
than
their
fair
share
of
*NL*
poor
relations
,
inasmuch
as
very
red
blood
of
the
superior
quality
,
*NL*
like
inferior
blood
unlawfully
shed
,
WILL
cry
aloud
and
WILL
be
*NL*
heard
.
Sir
Leicester
's
cousins
,
in
the
remotest
degree
,
are
so
many
*NL*
murders
in
the
respect
that
they
``
will
out
.
''
Among
whom
there
are
*NL*
cousins
who
are
so
poor
that
one
might
almost
dare
to
think
it
would
*NL*
have
been
the
happier
for
them
never
to
have
been
plated
links
upon
*NL*
the
Dedlock
chain
of
gold
,
but
to
have
been
made
of
common
iron
at
*NL*
first
and
done
base
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Service
,
however
-LRB-
with
a
few
limited
reservations
,
genteel
but
not
*NL*
profitable
-RRB-
,
they
may
not
do
,
being
of
the
Dedlock
dignity
.
So
they
*NL*
visit
their
richer
cousins
,
and
get
into
debt
when
they
can
,
and
live
*NL*
but
shabbily
when
they
ca
n't
,
and
find
--
the
women
no
husbands
,
and
*NL*
the
men
no
wives
--
and
ride
in
borrowed
carriages
,
and
sit
at
feasts
*NL*
that
are
never
of
their
own
making
,
and
so
go
through
high
life
.
The
*NL*
rich
family
sum
has
been
divided
by
so
many
figures
,
and
they
are
the
*NL*
something
over
that
nobody
knows
what
to
do
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
on
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
's
side
of
the
question
and
of
his
*NL*
way
of
thinking
would
appear
to
be
his
cousin
more
or
less
.
From
my
*NL*
Lord
Boodle
,
through
the
Duke
of
Foodle
,
down
to
Noodle
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
,
like
a
glorious
spider
,
stretches
his
threads
of
*NL*
relationship
.
But
while
he
is
stately
in
the
cousinship
of
the
*NL*
Everybodys
,
he
is
a
kind
and
generous
man
,
according
to
his
dignified
*NL*
way
,
in
the
cousinship
of
the
Nobodys
;
and
at
the
present
time
,
in
*NL*
despite
of
the
damp
,
he
stays
out
the
visit
of
several
such
cousins
*NL*
at
Chesney
Wold
with
the
constancy
of
a
martyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
,
foremost
in
the
front
rank
stands
Volumnia
Dedlock
,
a
young
*NL*
lady
-LRB-
of
sixty
-RRB-
who
is
doubly
highly
related
,
having
the
honour
to
be
*NL*
a
poor
relation
,
by
the
mother
's
side
,
to
another
great
family
.
Miss
*NL*
Volumnia
,
displaying
in
early
life
a
pretty
talent
for
cutting
*NL*
ornaments
out
of
coloured
paper
,
and
also
for
singing
to
the
guitar
*NL*
in
the
Spanish
tongue
,
and
propounding
French
conundrums
in
country
*NL*
houses
,
passed
the
twenty
years
of
her
existence
between
twenty
and
*NL*
forty
in
a
sufficiently
agreeable
manner
.
Lapsing
then
out
of
date
*NL*
and
being
considered
to
bore
mankind
by
her
vocal
performances
in
the
*NL*
Spanish
language
,
she
retired
to
Bath
,
where
she
lives
slenderly
on
*NL*
an
annual
present
from
Sir
Leicester
and
whence
she
makes
occasional
*NL*
resurrections
in
the
country
houses
of
her
cousins
.
She
has
an
*NL*
extensive
acquaintance
at
Bath
among
appalling
old
gentlemen
with
*NL*
thin
legs
and
nankeen
trousers
,
and
is
of
high
standing
in
that
*NL*
dreary
city
.
But
she
is
a
little
dreaded
elsewhere
in
consequence
of
*NL*
an
indiscreet
profusion
in
the
article
of
rouge
and
persistency
in
an
*NL*
obsolete
pearl
necklace
like
a
rosary
of
little
bird
's
-
eggs
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
country
in
a
wholesome
state
,
Volumnia
would
be
a
clear
case
*NL*
for
the
pension
list
.
Efforts
have
been
made
to
get
her
on
it
,
and
*NL*
when
William
Buffy
came
in
,
it
was
fully
expected
that
her
name
would
*NL*
be
put
down
for
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
.
But
William
Buffy
somehow
*NL*
discovered
,
contrary
to
all
expectation
,
that
these
were
not
the
*NL*
times
when
it
could
be
done
,
and
this
was
the
first
clear
indication
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
had
conveyed
to
him
that
the
country
was
going
*NL*
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
likewise
the
Honourable
Bob
Stables
,
who
can
make
warm
*NL*
mashes
with
the
skill
of
a
veterinary
surgeon
and
is
a
better
shot
*NL*
than
most
gamekeepers
.
He
has
been
for
some
time
particularly
*NL*
desirous
to
serve
his
country
in
a
post
of
good
emoluments
,
*NL*
unaccompanied
by
any
trouble
or
responsibility
.
In
a
well-regulated
*NL*
body
politic
this
natural
desire
on
the
part
of
a
spirited
young
*NL*
gentleman
so
highly
connected
would
be
speedily
recognized
,
but
*NL*
somehow
William
Buffy
found
when
he
came
in
that
these
were
not
times
*NL*
in
which
he
could
manage
that
little
matter
either
,
and
this
was
the
*NL*
second
indication
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
had
conveyed
to
him
that
the
*NL*
country
was
going
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
cousins
are
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
various
ages
and
*NL*
capacities
,
the
major
part
amiable
and
sensible
and
likely
to
have
*NL*
done
well
enough
in
life
if
they
could
have
overcome
their
*NL*
cousinship
;
as
it
is
,
they
are
almost
all
a
little
worsted
by
it
,
and
*NL*
lounge
in
purposeless
and
listless
paths
,
and
seem
to
be
quite
as
*NL*
much
at
a
loss
how
to
dispose
of
themselves
as
anybody
else
can
be
*NL*
how
to
dispose
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
society
,
and
where
not
,
my
Lady
Dedlock
reigns
supreme
.
*NL*
Beautiful
,
elegant
,
accomplished
,
and
powerful

her
little
world
*NL*
-LRB-
for
the
world
of
fashion
does
not
stretch
ALL
the
way
from
pole
to
*NL*
pole
-RRB-
,
her
influence
in
Sir
Leicester
's
house
,
however
haughty
and
*NL*
indifferent
her
manner
,
is
greatly
to
improve
it
and
refine
it
.
The
*NL*
cousins
,
even
those
older
cousins
who
were
paralysed
when
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
married
her
,
do
her
feudal
homage
;
and
the
Honourable
Bob
*NL*
Stables
daily
repeats
to
some
chosen
person
between
breakfast
and
*NL*
lunch
his
favourite
original
remark
,
that
she
is
the
best-groomed
*NL*
woman
in
the
whole
stud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
the
guests
in
the
long
drawing-room
at
Chesney
Wold
this
dismal
*NL*
night
when
the
step
on
the
Ghost
's
Walk
-LRB-
inaudible
here
,
however
-RRB-
*NL*
might
be
the
step
of
a
deceased
cousin
shut
out
in
the
cold
.
It
is
*NL*
near
bed-time
.
Bedroom
fires
blaze
brightly
all
over
the

raising
ghosts
of

*NL*
``

drawls
Volumnia
,
whose
*NL*
thoughts
perhaps
are
already
hopping
up
it
to
bed
,
after
a
long
*NL*
evening
of
very
desultory
talk
,
``

*NL*

says
Miss

reserving
her

``

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

with
his
magnificent
glance
of
displeasure
at

appears
to
say
so
too

*NL*
*NL*

remarks
my

languidly
,
``

there

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
feels
it
to
be
right
and
fitting
that
the
housekeeper
*NL*
of
Chesney
Wold
should
be
a
remarkable
person
.
Apart
from
that
,
he
*NL*
has
a
real
regard
for
Mrs.

likes
to
hear
her
praised

So
he
says
,
``
You

Volumnia
is
extremely

glad

*NL*
My

,
whose
chronic
malady
of
boredom
has
been
sadly
aggravated
by
*NL*
Volumnia
this
evening
,
glances
wearily
towards
the
candlesticks
and
*NL*
heaves
a
noiseless
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

it

a
remarkable
example

doubt

not

that

--
which
I
suppose
she
*NL*
will
.
I
have
never
seen
Rosa
until
to-day
,
but
I
have
some
confidence
*NL*
in
my
son
's
good
sense
--
even
in
love
.
I
find
her
what
he
represents
*NL*
her
,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
;
and
my
mother
speaks
of
her
with
*NL*
great
commendation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
in
all
respects
deserves
it
,
''
says
my
Lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
,
Lady
Dedlock
,
that
you
say
so
,
and
I
need
not
comment
on
*NL*
the
value
to
me
of
your
kind
opinion
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
observes
Sir
Leicester
with
unspeakable
grandeur
,
for
he
*NL*
thinks
the
ironmaster
a
little
too
glib
,
``
must
be
quite
unnecessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
unnecessary
,
Sir
Leicester
.
Now
,
my
son
is
a
very
young
man
,
*NL*
and
Rosa
is
a
very
young
woman
.
As
I
made
my
way
,
so
my
son
must
make
*NL*
his
;
and
his
being
married
at
present
is
out
of
the
question
.
But
*NL*
supposing
I
gave
my
consent
to
his
engaging
himself
to
this
pretty
*NL*
girl
,
if
this
pretty
girl
will
engage
herself
to
him
,
I
think
it
a
*NL*
piece
of
candour
to
say
at
once
--
I
am
sure
,
Sir
Leicester
and
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
,
you
will
understand
and
excuse
me
--
I
should
make
it
a
*NL*
condition
that
she
did
not
remain
at
Chesney
Wold
.
Therefore
,
before
*NL*
communicating
further
with
my
son
,
I
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
*NL*
if
her
removal
would
be
in
any
way
inconvenient
or
objectionable
,
I
*NL*
will
hold
the
matter
over
with
him
for
any
reasonable
time
and
leave
*NL*
it
precisely
where
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
remain
at
Chesney
Wold

Make
it
a
condition

All
Sir
Leicester
's
*NL*
old
misgivings
relative
to
Wat
Tyler
and
the
people
in
the
iron
*NL*
districts
who
do
nothing

turn
out
by
torchlight
come
in
a
shower
*NL*
upon
his
head
,
the
fine
grey
hair
of
which
,
as
well
as
of
his
*NL*
whiskers
,
actually
stirs
with
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*

says
Sir
Leicester

he
brings
her
in
thus
specially

first
as

*NL*
gallantry

next
as

point
of
prudence

her
sense

warning

off
with

Addressing

to
the

my

listens
with
attention

occasionally
slightly
bending
her

*NL*
``

half
a

will
die

no

one

*NL*
Sir

snorts
a

to
hear
the

laid
down
in

in

his
love
of
truth

he
freely
,

silently
,

admits
the
justice
of
the
ironmaster

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
for
saying

obvious

turn

But
as
I

found

I

*NL*
Sir

very
magnificent
again
at

spirited
off
from

end
her
days
with

proceeds
the

in

clear
way
,

beyond

have
had

*NL*
*NL*
A
little
boastfulness
in
his
fatherly
tone
here
,
as
if
he
added
in

his
heart

``
even
of

Chesney

Not
a
little
more
*NL*
magnificence
,
therefore
,
on
the
part
of
Sir
Leicester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
is
so
frequent

I
live

I
belong
,
that
what
would
be
generally
called
unequal
*NL*
marriages
are
not
of
such
rare
occurrence
with
us
as
elsewhere

A
son
*NL*
will
sometimes
make
it
known
to
his
father
that
he
has
fallen
in
*NL*
love
,
say
,
with
a
young
woman
in
the
factory

The
father
,
who
once
*NL*
worked
in
a
factory
himself
,
will
be
a
little
disappointed
at
first
*NL*
very
possibly
.
It
may
be
that
he
had
other
views
for
his
son
.
*NL*
However
,
the
chances
are
that
having
ascertained
the
young
woman
to
*NL*
be
of
unblemished
character
,
he
will
say
to
his
son
,

I
must
be
quite
*NL*
sure
you
are
in

This
is
a
serious
matter

you

Therefore
I
shall
have
this

educated
for
two
years

or
it
*NL*
may
be
,

I
shall
place
this

at

school
with
your

*NL*
for
such
a
time
,
during
which
you
will
give
me
your
word
and
honour
*NL*
to
see
her
only
so
often
.
If
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
when
she
*NL*
has
so
far
profited
by
her
advantages
as
that
you
may
be
upon
a
fair
*NL*
equality
,
you
are
both
in
the
same
mind
,
I
will
do
my
part
to
make
*NL*
you
happy
.

I
know
of
several
cases
such
as
I
describe

I
think
they
indicate
to

my

Sir

Calmly

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

directs
his
majestic
glance
down

up
the

me
,
child
.
You
are
young
and
true
,
and
I
believe
you
are
*NL*
attached
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
,
my
Lady
.
Indeed
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
I
*NL*
would
n't
do
to
show
how
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
n't
think
you
would
wish
to
leave
me
just
yet
,
Rosa
,
even
*NL*
for
a
lover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
Lady
!
Oh
,
no
!
''
Rosa
looks
up
for
the
first
time
,
quite
*NL*
frightened
at
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confide
in
me
,
my
child
.
Do
n't
fear
me
.
I
wish
you
to
be
happy
,
and
*NL*
will
make
you
so
--
if
I
can
make
anybody
happy
on
this
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
,
with
fresh
tears
,
kneels
at
her
feet
and
kisses
her
hand
.
My
*NL*
Lady
takes
the
hand
with
which
she
has
caught
it
,
and
standing
with
*NL*
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
,
puts
it
about
and
about
between
her
own
*NL*
two
hands
,
and
gradually
lets
it
fall
.
Seeing
her
so
absorbed
,
Rosa
*NL*
softly
withdraws
;
but
still
my
Lady
's
eyes
are
on
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
search
of
what
?
Of
any
hand
that
is
no
more
,
of
any
hand
that
*NL*
never
was
,
of
any
touch
that
might
have
magically
changed
her
life
?
*NL*
Or
does
she
listen
to
the
Ghost
's
Walk
and
think
what
step
does
it
*NL*
most
resemble
?
A
man
's
?
A
woman
's
?
The
pattering
of
a
little
child
's
*NL*
feet
,
ever
coming
on
--
on
--
on
?
Some
melancholy
influence
is
upon
her
,
*NL*
or
why
should
so
proud
a
lady
close
the
doors
and
sit
alone
upon
the
*NL*
hearth
so
desolate
?
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
is
away
next
day
,
and
all
the
cousins
are
scattered
before
*NL*
dinner
.
Not
a
cousin
of
the
batch
but
is
amazed
to
hear
from
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
at
breakfast-time
of
the
obliteration
of
landmarks
,
and
*NL*
opening
of
floodgates
,
and
cracking
of
the
framework
of
society
,
*NL*
manifested
through
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
son
.
Not
a
cousin
of
the
batch
*NL*
but
is
really
indignant
,
and
connects
it
with
the
feebleness
of
*NL*
William
Buffy
when
in
office
,
and
really
does
feel
deprived
of
a
*NL*
stake
in
the
country
--
or
the
pension
list
--
or
something
--
by
fraud
and
*NL*
wrong
.
As
to
Volumnia
,
she
is
handed
down
the
great
staircase
by
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
,
as
eloquent
upon
the
theme
as
if
there
were
a
general
*NL*
rising
in
the
north
of
England
to
obtain
her
rouge-pot
and
pearl
*NL*
necklace
.
And
thus
,
with
a
clatter
of
maids
and
valets
--
for
it
is
one
*NL*
appurtenance
of
their
cousinship
that
however
difficult
they
may
find
*NL*
it
to
keep
themselves
,
they
MUST
keep
maids
and
valets
--
the
cousins
*NL*
disperse
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
;
and
the
one
wintry
wind
that
*NL*
blows
to-day
shakes
a
shower
from
the
trees
near
the
deserted
house
,
*NL*
as
if
all
the
cousins
had
been
changed
into
leaves
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
The
Young
Man
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
is
shut
up
,
carpets
are
rolled
into
great
scrolls
in
*NL*
corners
of
comfortless
rooms
,
bright
damask
does
penance
in
brown
*NL*
holland
,
carving
and
gilding
puts
on
mortification
,
and
the
Dedlock
*NL*
ancestors
retire
from
the
light
of
day
again
.
Around
and
around
the
*NL*
house
the
leaves
fall
thick
,
but
never
fast
,
for
they
come
circling
*NL*
down
with
a
dead
lightness
that
is
sombre
and
slow
.
Let
the
gardener
*NL*
sweep
and
sweep
the
turf
as
he
will
,
and
press
the
leaves
into
full
*NL*
barrows
,
and
wheel
them
off
,
still
they
lie
ankle-deep
.
Howls
the
*NL*
shrill
wind
round
Chesney
Wold
;
the
sharp
rain
beats
,
the
windows
*NL*
rattle
,
and
the
chimneys
growl
.
Mists
hide
in
the
avenues
,
veil
the
*NL*
points
of
view
,
and
move
in
funeral-wise
across
the
rising
grounds
.
*NL*
On
all
the
house
there
is
a
cold
,
blank
smell
like
the
smell
of
a
*NL*
little
church
,
though
something
dryer
,
suggesting
that
the
dead
and
*NL*
buried
Dedlocks
walk
there
in
the
long
nights
and
leave
the
flavour
*NL*
of
their
graves
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
house
in
town
,
which
is
rarely
in
the
same
mind
as
Chesney
*NL*
Wold
at
the
same
time
,
seldom
rejoicing
when
it
rejoices
or
mourning
*NL*
when
it
mourns
,
excepting
when
a
Dedlock
dies
--
the
house
in
town
*NL*
shines
out
awakened
.
As
warm
and
bright
as
so
much
state
may
be
,
as
*NL*
delicately
redolent
of
pleasant
scents
that
bear
no
trace
of
winter
*NL*
as
hothouse
flowers
can
make
it
,
soft
and
hushed
so
that
the
ticking
*NL*
of
the
clocks
and
the
crisp
burning
of
the
fires
alone
disturb
the
*NL*
stillness
in
the
rooms
,
it
seems
to
wrap
those
chilled
bones
of
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
's
in
rainbow-coloured
wool
.
And
Sir
Leicester
is
glad
to
*NL*
repose
in
dignified
contentment
before
the
great
fire
in
the
library
,
*NL*
condescendingly
perusing
the
backs
of
his
books
or
honouring
the
fine
*NL*
arts
with
a
glance
of
approbation
.
For
he
has
his
pictures
,
ancient
*NL*
and
modern
.
Some
of
the
Fancy
Ball
School
in
which
art
occasionally
*NL*
condescends
to
become
a
master
,
which
would
be
best
catalogued
like
*NL*
the
miscellaneous
articles
in
a
sale
.
As
``
Three
high-backed
chairs
,
a
*NL*
table
and
cover
,
long-necked
bottle
-LRB-
containing
wine
-RRB-
,
one
flask
,
one
*NL*
Spanish
female
's
costume
,
three-quarter
face
portrait
of
Miss
Jogg
*NL*
the
model
,
and
a
suit
of
armour
containing
Don
Quixote
.
''
Or
``
One
*NL*
stone
terrace
-LRB-
cracked

complete
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
comes
and
goes
pretty
often
,
there
being
estate
*NL*
business
to
do
,
leases
to
be
renewed
,
and
so
on
.
He
sees
my
Lady
*NL*
pretty
often
,
too
;
and
he
and
she
are
as
composed
,
and
as
*NL*
indifferent
,
and
take
as
little
heed
of
one
another
,
as
ever
.
Yet
it
*NL*
may
be
that
my
Lady
fears
this
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
and
that
he
knows
it
.
*NL*
It
may
be
that
he
pursues
her
doggedly
and
steadily
,
with
no
touch
of
*NL*
compunction
,
remorse
,
or
pity
.
It
may
be
that
her
beauty
and
all
the
*NL*
state
and
brilliancy
surrounding
her
only
gives
him
the
greater
zest
*NL*
for
what
he
is
set
upon
and
makes
him
the
more
inflexible
in
it
.
*NL*
Whether
he
be
cold
and
cruel
,
whether
immovable
in
what
he
has
made
*NL*
his
duty
,
whether
absorbed
in
love
of
power
,
whether
determined
*NL*
to
have
nothing
hidden
from
him
in
ground
where
he
has
burrowed
*NL*
among
secrets
all
his
life
,
whether
he
in
his
heart
despises
the
*NL*
splendour
of
which
he
is
a
distant
beam
,
whether
he
is
always
*NL*
treasuring
up
slights
and
offences
in
the
affability
of
his
gorgeous
*NL*
clients
--
whether
he
be
any
of
this
,
or
all
of
this
,
it
may
be
that
my
*NL*
Lady
had
better
have
five
thousand
pairs
of
fashionable
eyes
upon
*NL*
her
,
in
distrustful
vigilance
,
than
the
two
eyes
of
this
rusty
lawyer
*NL*
with
his
wisp
of
neckcloth
and
his
dull
black
breeches
tied
with
*NL*
ribbons
at
the
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
sits
in
my
Lady
's
room
--
that
room
in
which
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
read
the
affidavit
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
--
particularly
*NL*
complacent
.
My
Lady
,
as
on
that
day
,
sits
before
the
fire
with
her
*NL*
screen
in
her
hand
.
Sir
Leicester
is
particularly
complacent
because
*NL*
he
has
found
in
his
newspaper
some
congenial
remarks
bearing
directly
*NL*
on
the
floodgates
and
the
framework
of
society
.
They
apply
so
happily
*NL*
to
the
late
case
that
Sir
Leicester
has
come
from
the
library
to
my
*NL*
Lady
's
room
expressly
to
read
them
aloud
.
``
The
man
who
wrote
this
*NL*
article
,
''
he
observes
by
way
of
preface
,
nodding
at
the
fire
as
if
he
*NL*
were
nodding
down
at
the
man
from
a
mount
,
``
has
a
well-balanced
*NL*
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
mind
is
not
so
well
balanced
but
that
he
bores
my
Lady
,
*NL*
who
,
after
a
languid
effort
to
listen
,
or
rather
a
languid
*NL*
resignation
of
herself
to
a
show
of
listening
,
becomes
distraught
and
*NL*
falls
into
a
contemplation
of
the
fire
as
if
it
were
her
fire
at
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
,
and
she
had
never
left
it
.
Sir
Leicester
,
quite
*NL*
unconscious
,
reads
on
through
his
double
eye-glass
,
occasionally
*NL*
stopping
to
remove
his
glass
and
express
approval
,
as
``
Very
true
*NL*
indeed
,
''
``
Very
properly
put
,
''
``
I
have
frequently
made
the
same
remark
*NL*
myself
,
''
invariably
losing
his
place
after
each
observation
,
and
*NL*
going
up
and
down
the
column
to
find
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
is
reading
with
infinite
gravity
and
state
when
the
*NL*
door
opens
,
and
the
Mercury
in
powder
makes
this
strange
*NL*
announcement
,
``
The
young
man
,
my
Lady
,
of
the
name
of
Guppy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
pauses
,
stares
,
repeats
in
a
killing
voice
,
``
The
young
*NL*
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
round
,
he
beholds
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
,
much
*NL*
discomfited
and
not
presenting
a
very
impressive
letter
of
*NL*
introduction
in
his
manner
and
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
''
says
Sir
Leicester
to
Mercury
,
``
what
do
you
mean
by
*NL*
announcing
with
this
abruptness
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
Leicester
,
but
my
Lady
said
she
would
see
the
*NL*
young
man
whenever
he
called
.
I
was
not
aware
that
you
were
here
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
apology
,
Mercury
directs
a
scornful
and
indignant
look
at
*NL*
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
which
plainly
says
,
``
What
do
you
*NL*
come
calling
here
for
and
getting
ME
into
a
row
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
right
.
I
gave
him
those
directions

''
says
my
Lady
.
``
Let
*NL*
the
young
man
wait

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means

Since
he
has
your
orders
to
come

I
will
not
*NL*
interrupt
you
.
''
Sir
Leicester
in
his
gallantry
retires
,
rather
*NL*
declining
to
accept
a
bow
from
the
young
man
as
he
goes
out
and
*NL*
majestically
supposing
him
to
be
some
shoemaker
of
intrusive
*NL*
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
looks
imperiously
at
her
visitor
when
the
servant
has
*NL*
left
the
room
,
casting
her
eyes
over
him
from
head
to
foot
.
She
*NL*
suffers
him
to
stand
by
the
door
and
asks
him
what
he
wants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
your
ladyship
would
have
the
kindness
to
oblige
me
with
a
*NL*
little
conversation
,
''
returns
Mr.
Guppy
,
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
of
course
,
the
person
who
has
written
me
so
many
letters

*NL*
*NL*
``
Several

Several
before

condescended
to

favour
me
with
an
answer

*NL*
``
And
could
you
not
take
the

means
of
rendering
a
Conversation
*NL*
unnecessary
?
Can
you
not
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
screws
his
mouth
into
a
silent
``
No
!
''
and
shakes
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
strangely
importunate

If
it
should
appear

after
all

not
concern
me

I
do

it

short

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
,
with
a
careless
toss
of
her
screen
,
turns
herself
towards
*NL*
the
fire
again
,
sitting
almost
with
her
back
to
the
young
man
of
the
*NL*
name
of
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
your

says
the
young
man
,
``

told

my

first
letter

in

Being
in
the
law

I
have
learnt
the
habit

of
not
committing
myself
in

I
did
not
mention

it

After
waiting
for
a
moment
to
receive
some
assurance
to
the
contrary
,
*NL*
and
not
receiving
any
,
Mr.
Guppy
proceeds
,
``
If

Mr.

so

Mr.

Guppy
refers
to
a
little
slip
of
paper
on

he
has
made
small
*NL*
notes
of
his
line
of
argument

which
seems
to
involve
him
in

densest
obscurity

looks

should
be
placed

*NL*
*NL*
My

with
a

gesture

holds
the
screen

assures
him
of
his
being
worth
no

Mr.

going

tumbles
into

to

says
in
his
confusion

This

does
not
tend

the
greater
legibility

He

growing
warm

red

holding

close

off

*NL*
Young

There
have
been
times
,
when

lived
in
strongholds
and
had
unscrupulous
attendants
within
call
,
*NL*
when
that

a

with
those
beautiful
eyes
looking
at
you
as
they
look
at
*NL*
this
moment

*NL*
*NL*
My

,
slowly
using
her
little
hand-screen
as
a
fan
,
asks
him
again

what

supposes

his
taste

Mr.

draws
his

a

forward

seats
himself
again

My

reclines
in

composedly

less
of

gaze

Rolling
up
the

his

am
informed
of
that
fact

already

had
a

right

A
kind
of
angry
smile
just
dawns
upon
my

face

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

I

made

on
my

advancing
from

heavy

took

*NL*
*NL*
Is
the
dead
colour
on
my

's
face
reflected
from
the
screen
which
*NL*
has
a
green
silk
ground
and
which
she
holds
in
her
raised
hand
as
if
*NL*
she
had
forgotten
it
,
or
is
it
a
dreadful
paleness
that
has
fallen
on
*NL*
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your

says
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
My

's
lips
move

they
utter
nothing

She
shakes
her
head

*NL*
``
NOT

Mr.

After
each
of
these

interrogatories
,
she
has
inclined
her
head

``
Very
good

Now

this

being
generally

given

On

only
*NL*
one

she
seems
to
have
been
confidential
to
my

she
then
told

Mr.

stares

sits
before
him
looking
him
through

with
the

dark
shade
upon

in
the

attitude
even
to

the
holding
of

,
with
her
lips
a
little
apart
,
her
brow
a
*NL*
little
contracted

but
for
the

dead

He
sees
her
consciousness
*NL*
return
,
sees
a
tremor
pass
across
her
frame
like
a
ripple
over

*NL*
sees
her

shake

compose

sees

her
force
herself
back
to
the
knowledge
of
his
presence

of
what
*NL*
he
has
said

All
this

so
quickly

that
her
exclamation
and
her
dead

condition
seem
to
have
passed
away

long-preserved

sometimes
opened
up

struck

hired
a

boy
to
show
it

her

would
wish

have
the
boy
produced
in

is
nothing

``
If

glove
off

you
'd
think
it
quite

romantic

*NL*
There
are
diamonds
glittering
on

holds
the

My

trifles
with

makes

glitter
more

again
with

dangerous

he
did

to
give
your

a
family
interest
in
*NL*
going
further
into
the
case
,
I
will
bring
these
papers
here
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
they
are
,
except
that
they
are
old
letters
:
I
have
never
*NL*
had
them
in
my
possession
yet
.
I
will
bring
those
papers
here
as
soon
*NL*
as
I
get
them
and
go
over
them
for
the
first
time
with
your
ladyship
.
*NL*
I
have
told
your
ladyship
my
object
.
I
have
told
your
ladyship
that
I
*NL*
should
be
placed
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
if
any
complaint
*NL*
was
made
,
and
all
is
in
strict
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Is
this
the
full
purpose
of
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
,
or
*NL*
has
he
any
other
?
Do
his
words
disclose
the
length
,
breadth
,
depth
,
*NL*
of
his
object
and
suspicion
in
coming
here
;
or
if
not
,
what
do
they
*NL*
hide
?
He
is
a
match
for
my
Lady
there
.
She
may
look
at
him
,
but
he
*NL*
can
look
at
the
table
and
keep
that
witness-box
face
of
his
from
*NL*
telling
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
bring
the
letters
,
''
says
my
Lady
,
``
if
you
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ladyship
is
not
very
encouraging
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
''
*NL*
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
a
little
injured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
bring
the
letters
,
''
she
repeats
in
the
same
tone
,
``
if
*NL*
you
--
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
done
.
I
wish
your
ladyship
good
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
table
near
her
is
a
rich
bauble
of
a
casket
,
barred
and
clasped
*NL*
like
an
old
strong-chest
.
She
,
looking
at
him
still
,
takes
it
to
her
*NL*
and
unlocks
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
assure
your
ladyship
I
am
not
actuated
by
any
motives
of
that
*NL*
sort
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
and
I
could
n't
accept
anything
of
the
kind

I
*NL*
wish
your

good

am
much
obliged
to
you
all
the
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
young
man
makes
his
bow
and
goes
downstairs
,
where
the
*NL*
supercilious
Mercury
does
not
consider
himself
called
upon
to
leave
*NL*
his
Olympus
by
the
hall-fire
to
let
the
young
man
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Sir
Leicester
basks
in
his
library
and
dozes
over
his
newspaper
,
*NL*
is
there
no
influence
in
the
house
to
startle
him
,
not
to
say
to
make
*NL*
the
very
trees
at
Chesney
Wold
fling
up
their
knotted
arms
,
the
very
*NL*
portraits
frown
,
the
very
armour
stir
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
Words
,
sobs
,
and
cries
are
but
air
,
and
air
is
so
shut
in
and
*NL*
shut
out
throughout
the
house
in
town
that
sounds
need
be
uttered
*NL*
trumpet-tongued
indeed
by
my
Lady
in
her
chamber
to
carry
any
faint
*NL*
vibration
to
Sir
Leicester
's
ears
;
and
yet
this
cry
is
in
the
house
,
*NL*
going
upward
from
a
wild
figure
on
its
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
my

Not
dead

first
hours

cruel

sternly

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
had
been
gone
away
some
time
when
a
visitor
came
to
pass
a
*NL*
few
days
with
us
.
It
was
an
elderly
lady
.
It
was
Mrs.
Woodcourt
,
who
,
*NL*
having
come
from
Wales
to
stay
with
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
and
having
*NL*
written
to
my
guardian
,
``
by
her
son
Allan
's
desire
,
''
to
report
that
*NL*
she
had
heard
from
him
and
that
he
was
well
``
and
sent
his
kind
*NL*
remembrances
to
all
of
us
,
''
had
been
invited
by
my
guardian
to
make
a
*NL*
visit
to
Bleak
House
.
She
stayed
with
us
nearly
three
weeks
.
She
took
*NL*
very
kindly
to
me
and
was
extremely
confidential
,
so
much
so
that
*NL*
sometimes
she
almost
made
me
uncomfortable
.
I
had
no
right
,
I
knew
*NL*
very
well
,
to
be
uncomfortable
because
she
confided
in
me
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
it
was
unreasonable
;
still
,
with
all
I
could
do
,
I
could
not
quite
*NL*
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
such
a
sharp
little
lady
and
used
to
sit
with
her
hands
*NL*
folded
in
each
other
looking
so
very
watchful
while
she
talked
to
me
*NL*
that
perhaps
I
found
that
rather
irksome
.
Or
perhaps
it
was
her
being
*NL*
so
upright
and
trim
,
though
I
do
n't
think
it
was
that
,
because
I
*NL*
thought
that
quaintly
pleasant
.
Nor
can
it
have
been
the
general
*NL*
expression
of
her
face
,
which
was
very
sparkling
and
pretty
for
an
*NL*
old
lady
.
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
.
Or
at
least
if
I
do
now
,
I
*NL*
thought
I
did
not
then
.
Or
at
least
--
but
it
do
n't
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
night
when
I
was
going
upstairs
to
bed
,
she
would
invite
me
*NL*
into
her
room
,
where
she
sat
before
the
fire
in
a
great
chair
;
*NL*
and
,
dear
me
,
she
would
tell
me
about
Morgan
ap-Kerrig
until
I
*NL*
was
quite
low-spirited
!
Sometimes
she
recited
a
few
verses
from
*NL*
Crumlinwallinwer
and
the
Mewlinnwillinwodd
-LRB-
if
those
are
the
right
*NL*
names
,
which
I
dare
say
they
are
not
-RRB-
,
and
would
become
quite
fiery
*NL*
with
the
sentiments
they
expressed
.
Though
I
never
knew
what
they
*NL*
were
-LRB-
being
in
Welsh
-RRB-
,
further
than
that
they
were
highly
eulogistic
*NL*
of
the
lineage
of
Morgan
ap-Kerrig
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
she
would
say
to
me
with
stately
triumph
,
*NL*
``
this
,
you
see
,
is
the
fortune
inherited
by
my
son
.
Wherever
my
son
*NL*
goes
,
he
can
claim
kindred
with
Ap-Kerrig
.
He
may
not
have
money
,
but
*NL*
he
always
has
what
is
much
better
--
family
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
my
doubts
of
their
caring
so
very
much
for
Morgan
ap-Kerrig
in
*NL*
India
and
China
,
but
of
course
I
never
expressed
them
.
I
used
to
say
*NL*
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
so
highly
connected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
IS
,
my
dear
,
a
great
thing
,
''
Mrs.
Woodcourt
would
reply
.
``
It
has
*NL*
its
disadvantages
;
my
son
's
choice
of
a
wife
,
for
instance
,
is
*NL*
limited
by
it
,
but
the
matrimonial
choice
of
the
royal
family
is
*NL*
limited
in
much
the
same
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
would
pat
me
on
the
arm
and
smooth
my
dress
,
as
much
as
to
*NL*
assure
me
that
she
had
a
good
opinion
of
me
,
the
distance
between
us
*NL*
notwithstanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
my
dear
,
''
she
would
say
,
and
always
with
some
*NL*
emotion
,
for
with
her
lofty
pedigree
she
had
a
very
affectionate
*NL*
heart
,
``
was
descended
from
a
great
Highland
family
,
the
MacCoorts
of
*NL*
MacCoort
.
He
served
his
king
and
country
as
an
officer
in
the
Royal
*NL*
Highlanders
,
and
he
died
on
the
field
.
My
son
is
one
of
the
last
*NL*
representatives
of
two
old
families
.
With
the
blessing
of
heaven
he
*NL*
will
set
them
up
again
and
unite
them
with
another
old
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
for
me
to
try
to
change
the
subject
,
as
I
used
to
try
,
*NL*
only
for
the
sake
of
novelty
or
perhaps
because
--
but
I
need
not
be
so
*NL*
particular
.
Mrs.
Woodcourt
never
would
let
me
change
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
she
said
one
night
,
``
you
have
so
much
sense
and
you
look
*NL*
at
the
world
in
a
quiet
manner
so
superior
to
your
time
of
life
that
*NL*
it
is
a
comfort
to
me
to
talk
to
you
about
these
family
matters
of
*NL*
mine
.
You
do
n't
know
much
of
my
son
,
my
dear
;
but
you
know
enough
of
*NL*
him
,
I
dare
say
,
to
recollect
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
I
recollect
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
.
Now
,
my
dear
,
I
think
you
are
a
judge
of
character
,
*NL*
and
I
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Woodcourt
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
is
so
difficult
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
so
difficult
,
my
dear
?
''
she
returned
.
``
I
do
n't
see
it
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
give
an
opinion
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
so
slight
an
acquaintance
,
my
dear
.
THAT
'S
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
mean
that
,
because
Mr.
Woodcourt
had
been
at
our
house
a
*NL*
good
deal
altogether
and
had
become
quite
intimate
with
my
guardian
.
*NL*
I
said
so
,
and
added
that
he
seemed
to
be
very
clever
in
his
*NL*
profession
--
we
thought
--
and
that
his
kindness
and
gentleness
to
Miss
*NL*
Flite
were
above
all
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
him
justice
!
''
said
Mrs.
Woodcourt
,
pressing
my
hand
.
``
You
*NL*
define
him
exactly
.
Allan
is
a
dear
fellow
,
and
in
his
profession
*NL*
faultless
.
I
say
it
,
though
I
am
his
mother
.
Still
,
I
must
confess
he
*NL*
is
not
without
faults
,
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
us
are
,

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
But
his
really
are
faults
that
he
might
correct
,
and
ought
to
*NL*
correct

returned
the
sharp
old
lady
,
sharply
shaking
her
head
.
``
I
*NL*
am
so
much
attached
to
you
that
I
may
confide
in
you
,
my
dear
,
as
a
*NL*
third
party
wholly
disinterested
,
that
he
is
fickleness
itself

*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
should
have
thought
it
hardly
possible
that
he
could
have
*NL*
been
otherwise
than
constant
to
his
profession
and
zealous
in
the
*NL*
pursuit
of
it
,
judging
from
the
reputation
he
had
earned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
again

the
old
lady

``

I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!

I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she

I
refer

*NL*
always
paying
trivial
attentions
to
young

,
and
always
has
*NL*
been
,
ever
since
he
was
eighteen
.
Now
,
my
dear
,
he
has
never
really
*NL*
cared
for
any
one
of
them
and
has
never
meant
in
doing
this
to
do
any
*NL*
harm

to
express
anything

politeness

good
nature

Still

*NL*
it
's
not
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
I
,
as
she
seemed
to
wait
for
me

*NL*
``
And
it
might
lead

mistaken
notions

*NL*

I
supposed

in
justice

he

always

I

you

better

my

no

now
gone

far
away

for
an

indefinite
time

as
he
will
have
good

introductions

may
consider
this
past

gone

.
It
made
me
for
some
part
of
that
night
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
I
was
so
ashamed
of
my
folly
that
I
did
not
like
to
*NL*
confess
it
even
to
Ada
,
and
that
made
me
more
uncomfortable
still
.
I
*NL*
would
have
given
anything
not
to
have
been
so
much
in
the
bright
old
*NL*
lady
's
confidence
if
I
could
have
possibly
declined
it
.
It
gave
me
*NL*
the
most
inconsistent
opinions
of
her
.
At
one
time
I
thought
she
was
*NL*
a
story-teller
,
and
at
another
time
that
she
was
the
pink
of
truth
.
*NL*
Now
I
suspected
that
she
was
very
cunning
,
next
moment
I
believed
her
*NL*
honest
Welsh
heart
to
be
perfectly
innocent
and
simple
.
And
after
*NL*
all
,
what
did
it
matter
to
me
,
and
why
did
it
matter
to
me
?
Why
could
*NL*
not
I
,
going
up
to
bed
with
my
basket
of
keys
,
stop
to
sit
down
by
*NL*
her
fire
and
accommodate
myself
for
a
little
while
to
her
,
at
least
*NL*
as
well
as
to
anybody
else
,
and
not
trouble
myself
about
the
harmless
*NL*
things
she
said
to
me
?
Impelled
towards
her
,
as
I
certainly
was
,
for
*NL*
I
was
very
anxious
that
she
should
like
me
and
was
very
glad
indeed
*NL*
that
she
did
,
why
should
I
harp
afterwards
,
with
actual
distress
and
*NL*
pain
,
on
every
word
she
said
and
weigh
it
over
and
over
again
in
*NL*
twenty
scales
?
Why
was
it
so
worrying
to
me
to
have
her
in
our
house
,
*NL*
and
confidential
to
me
every
night
,
when
I
yet
felt
that
it
was
*NL*
better
and
safer
somehow
that
she
should
be
there
than
anywhere
else
?
*NL*
These
were
perplexities
and
contradictions
that
I
could
not
account
*NL*
for
.
At
least
,
if
I
could
--
but
I
shall
come
to
all
that
by
and
by
,
*NL*
and
it
is
mere
idleness
to
go
on
about
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
Mrs.
Woodcourt
went
away
,
I
was
sorry
to
lose
her
but
was
*NL*
relieved
too
.
And
then
Caddy
Jellyby
came
down
,
and
Caddy
brought
*NL*
such
a
packet
of
domestic
news
that
it
gave
us
abundant
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
Caddy
declared
-LRB-
and
would
at
first
declare
nothing
else
-RRB-
that
I
*NL*
was
the
best
adviser
that
ever
was
known
.
This
,
my
pet
said
,
was
no
*NL*
news
at
all
;
and
this
,
I
said
,
of
course
,
was
nonsense
.
Then
Caddy
*NL*
told
us
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
in
a
month
and
that
if
Ada
*NL*
and
I
would
be
her
bridesmaids
,
she
was
the
happiest
girl
in
the
*NL*
world
.
To
be
sure
,
this
was
news
indeed
;
and
I
thought
we
never
*NL*
should
have
done
talking
about
it
,
we
had
so
much
to
say
to
Caddy
,
*NL*
and
Caddy
had
so
much
to
say
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
that
Caddy
's
unfortunate
papa
had
got
over
his
*NL*
bankruptcy
--
``
gone
through
the
Gazette
,
''
was
the
expression
Caddy
*NL*
used
,
as
if
it
were
a
tunnel
--
with
the
general
clemency
and
*NL*
commiseration
of
his
creditors
,
and
had
got
rid
of
his
affairs
in
*NL*
some
blessed
manner
without
succeeding
in
understanding
them
,
and
had
*NL*
given
up
everything
he
possessed
-LRB-
which
was
not
worth
much
,
I
should
*NL*
think
,
to
judge
from
the
state
of
the
furniture
-RRB-
,
and
had
satisfied
*NL*
every
one
concerned
that
he
could
do
no
more
,
poor
man
.
So
,
he
had
*NL*
been
honourably
dismissed
to
``
the
office
''
to
begin
the
world
again
.
*NL*
What
he
did
at
the
office
,
I
never
knew
;
Caddy
said
he
was
a
*NL*
``
custom-house
and
general
agent
,
''
and
the
only
thing
I
ever
*NL*
understood
about
that
business
was
that
when
he
wanted
money
more
*NL*
than
usual
he
went
to
the
docks
to
look
for
it
,
and
hardly
ever
found
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
her
papa
had
tranquillized
his
mind
by
becoming
this
shorn
*NL*
lamb
,
and
they
had
removed
to
a
furnished
lodging
in
Hatton
Garden
*NL*
-LRB-
where
I
found
the
children
,
when
I
afterwards
went
there
,
cutting
*NL*
the
horse
hair
out
of
the
seats
of
the
chairs
and
choking
themselves
*NL*
with
it
-RRB-
,
Caddy
had
brought
about
a
meeting
between
him
and
old
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
;
and
poor
Mr.
Jellyby
,
being
very
humble
and
meek
,
had
*NL*
deferred
to
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
deportment
so
submissively
that
they
had
*NL*
become
excellent
friends
.
By
degrees
,
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
thus
*NL*
familiarized
with
the
idea
of
his
son
's
marriage
,
had
worked
up
his
*NL*
parental
feelings
to
the
height
of
contemplating
that
event
as
being
*NL*
near
at
hand
and
had
given
his
gracious
consent
to
the
young
couple
*NL*
commencing
housekeeping
at
the
academy
in
Newman
Street
when
they
*NL*
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
papa
,
Caddy
.
What
did
he
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Poor
Pa
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
only
cried
and
said
he
hoped
we
might
get
*NL*
on
better
than
he
and
Ma
had
got
on
.
He
did
n't
say
so
before
Prince
,
*NL*
he
only
said
so
to
me
.
And
he
said
,
`
My
poor
girl
,
you
have
not
been
*NL*
very
well
taught
how
to
make
a
home
for
your
husband
,
but
unless
you
*NL*
mean
with
all
your
heart
to
strive
to
do
it
,
you
had
better
murder
*NL*
him
than
marry
him
--
if
you
really
love
him
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
you
reassure
him
,
Caddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
was
very
distressing
,
you
know
,
to
see
poor
Pa
so
low
and
*NL*
hear
him
say
such
terrible
things
,
and
I
could
n't
help
crying
myself
.
*NL*
But
I
told
him
that
I
DID
mean
it
with
all
my
heart
and
that
I
hoped
*NL*
our
house
would
be
a
place
for
him
to
come
and
find
some
comfort
in
*NL*
of
an
evening
and
that
I
hoped
and
thought
I
could
be
a
better
*NL*
daughter
to
him
there
than
at
home
.
Then
I
mentioned
Peepy
's
coming
*NL*
to
stay
with
me
,
and
then
Pa
began
to
cry
again
and
said
the
children
*NL*
were
Indians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indians
,
Caddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
wild
Indians
.
And
Pa
said
''
--
here
she
began
to
*NL*
sob
,
poor
girl
,
not
at
all
like
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
--
``
that
*NL*
he
was
sensible
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
them
was
their
*NL*
being
all
tomahawked
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
suggested
that
it
was
comfortable
to
know
that
Mr.
Jellyby
did
*NL*
not
mean
these
destructive
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
I
know
Pa
would
n't
like
his
family
to
be
weltering
in
*NL*
their
blood
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
but
he
means
that
they
are
very
*NL*
unfortunate
in
being
Ma
's
children
and
that
he
is
very
unfortunate
in
*NL*
being
Ma
's
husband
;
and
I
am
sure
that
's
true
,
though
it
seems
*NL*
unnatural
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
Caddy
if
Mrs.
Jellyby
knew
that
her
wedding-day
was
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
know
what
Ma
is
,
Esther
,
''
she
returned
.
``
It
's
impossible
to
*NL*
say
whether
she
knows
it
or
not
.
She
has
been
told
it
often
enough
;
*NL*
and
when
she
IS
told
it
,
she
only
gives
me
a
placid
look
,
as
if
I
was
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
--
a
steeple
in
the
distance
,
''
said
Caddy
with
a
*NL*
sudden
idea
;
``
and
then
she
shakes
her
head
and
says
`
Oh
,
Caddy
,
*NL*
Caddy
,
what
a
tease
you
are
!
'
and
goes
on
with
the
Borrioboola
*NL*
letters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
about
your
wardrobe
,
Caddy
?
''
said
I.
For
she
was
under
no
*NL*
restraint
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Esther
,
''
she
returned
,
drying
her
eyes
,
``
I
must
do
the
*NL*
best
I
can
and
trust
to
my
dear
Prince
never
to
have
an
unkind
*NL*
remembrance
of
my
coming
so
shabbily
to
him
.
If
the
question
*NL*
concerned
an
outfit
for
Borrioboola
,
Ma
would
know
all
about
it
and
*NL*
would
be
quite
excited
.
Being
what
it
is
,
she
neither
knows
nor
*NL*
cares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
was
not
at
all
deficient
in
natural
affection
for
her
mother
,
*NL*
but
mentioned
this
with
tears
as
an
undeniable
fact
,
which
I
am
*NL*
afraid
it
was
.
We
were
sorry
for
the
poor
dear
girl
and
found
so
much
*NL*
to
admire
in
the
good
disposition
which
had
survived
under
such
*NL*
discouragement
that
we
both
at
once
-LRB-
I
mean
Ada
and
I
-RRB-
proposed
a
*NL*
little
scheme
that
made
her
perfectly
joyful
.
This
was
her
staying
*NL*
with
us
for
three
weeks
,
my
staying
with
her
for
one
,
and
our
all
*NL*
three
contriving
and
cutting
out
,
and
repairing
,
and
sewing
,
and
*NL*
saving
,
and
doing
the
very
best
we
could
think
of
to
make
the
most
of
*NL*
her
stock
.
My
guardian
being
as
pleased
with
the
idea
as
Caddy
was
,
*NL*
we
took
her
home
next
day
to
arrange
the
matter
and
brought
her
out
*NL*
again
in
triumph
with
her
boxes
and
all
the
purchases
that
could
be
*NL*
squeezed
out
of
a
ten-pound
note
,
which
Mr.
Jellyby
had
found
in
the
*NL*
docks
I
suppose
,
but
which
he
at
all
events
gave
her
.
What
my
*NL*
guardian
would
not
have
given
her
if
we
had
encouraged
him
,
it
would
*NL*
be
difficult
to
say
,
but
we
thought
it
right
to
compound
for
no
more
*NL*
than
her
wedding-dress
and
bonnet
.
He
agreed
to
this
compromise
,
and
*NL*
if
Caddy
had
ever
been
happy
in
her
life
,
she
was
happy
when
we
sat
*NL*
down
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
clumsy
enough
with
her
needle
,
poor
girl
,
and
pricked
her
*NL*
fingers
as
much
as
she
had
been
used
to
ink
them
.
She
could
not
help
*NL*
reddening
a
little
now
and
then
,
partly
with
the
smart
and
partly
*NL*
with
vexation
at
being
able
to
do
no
better
,
but
she
soon
got
over
*NL*
that
and
began
to
improve
rapidly
.
So
day
after
day
she
,
and
my
*NL*
darling
,
and
my
little
maid
Charley
,
and
a
milliner
out
of
the
town
,
*NL*
and
I
,
sat
hard
at
work
,
as
pleasantly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
and
above
this
,
Caddy
was
very
anxious
``
to
learn
housekeeping
,
''
*NL*
as
she
said
.
Now
,
mercy
upon
us
!
The
idea
of
her
learning
*NL*
housekeeping
of
a
person
of
my
vast
experience
was
such
a
joke
that
I
*NL*
laughed
,
and
coloured
up
,
and
fell
into
a
comical
confusion
when
she
*NL*
proposed
it
.
However
,
I
said
,
``
Caddy
,
I
am
sure
you
are
very
welcome
*NL*
to
learn
anything
that
you
can
learn
of
ME
,
my
dear
,
''
and
I
showed
*NL*
her
all
my
books
and
methods
and
all
my
fidgety
ways
.
You
would
have
*NL*
supposed
that
I
was
showing
her
some
wonderful
inventions
,
by
her
*NL*
study
of
them
;
and
if
you
had
seen
her
,
whenever
I
jingled
my
*NL*
housekeeping
keys
,
get
up
and
attend
me
,
certainly
you
might
have
*NL*
thought
that
there
never
was
a
greater
imposter
than
I
with
a
blinder
*NL*
follower
than
Caddy
Jellyby
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
what
with
working
and
housekeeping
,
and
lessons
to
Charley
,
and
*NL*
backgammon
in
the
evening
with
my
guardian
,
and
duets
with
Ada
,
the
*NL*
three
weeks
slipped
fast
away
.
Then
I
went
home
with
Caddy
to
see
*NL*
what
could
be
done
there
,
and
Ada
and
Charley
remained
behind
to
take
*NL*
care
of
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
say
I
went
home
with
Caddy
,
I
mean
to
the
furnished
lodging
in
*NL*
Hatton
Garden
.
We
went
to
Newman
Street
two
or
three
times
,
where
*NL*
preparations
were
in
progress
too
--
a
good
many
,
I
observed
,
for
*NL*
enhancing
the
comforts
of
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
and
a
few
for
putting
*NL*
the
newly
married
couple
away
cheaply
at
the
top
of
the
house
--
but
*NL*
our
great
point
was
to
make
the
furnished
lodging
decent
for
the
*NL*
wedding-breakfast
and
to
imbue
Mrs.
Jellyby
beforehand
with
some
*NL*
faint
sense
of
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
the
more
difficult
thing
of
the
two
because
Mrs.
*NL*
Jellyby
and
an
unwholesome
boy
occupied
the
front
sitting-room
-LRB-
the
*NL*
back
one
was
a
mere
closet
-RRB-
,
and
it
was
littered
down
with
*NL*
waste-paper
and
Borrioboolan
documents
,
as
an
untidy
stable
might
be
*NL*
littered
with
straw
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
sat
there
all
day
drinking
strong
*NL*
coffee
,
dictating
,
and
holding
Borrioboolan
interviews
by
*NL*
appointment
.
The
unwholesome
boy
,
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
going
into
a
*NL*
decline
,
took
his
meals
out
of
the
house
.
When
Mr.
Jellyby
came
home
,
*NL*
he
usually
groaned
and
went
down
into
the
kitchen
.
There
he
got
*NL*
something
to
eat
if
the
servant
would
give
him
anything
,
and
then
,
*NL*
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
way
,
went
out
and
walked
about
Hatton
*NL*
Garden
in
the
wet
.
The
poor
children
scrambled
up
and
tumbled
down
*NL*
the
house
as
they
had
always
been
accustomed
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
production
of
these
devoted
little
sacrifices
in
any
presentable
*NL*
condition
being
quite
out
of
the
question
at
a
week
's
notice
,
I
*NL*
proposed
to
Caddy
that
we
should
make
them
as
happy
as
we
could
on
*NL*
her
marriage
morning
in
the
attic
where
they
all
slept
,
and
should
*NL*
confine
our
greatest
efforts
to
her
mama
and
her
mama
's
room
,
and
a
*NL*
clean
breakfast
.
In
truth
Mrs.
Jellyby
required
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
attention
,
the
lattice-work
up
her
back
having
widened
considerably
*NL*
since
I
first
knew
her
and
her
hair
looking
like
the
mane
of
a
*NL*
dustman
's
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
that
the
display
of
Caddy
's
wardrobe
would
be
the
best
means
*NL*
of
approaching
the
subject
,
I
invited
Mrs.
Jellyby
to
come
and
look
*NL*
at
it
spread
out
on
Caddy
's
bed
in
the
evening
after
the
unwholesome
*NL*
boy
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
she
,
rising
from
her
desk
with
her
*NL*
usual
sweetness
of
temper
,
``
these
are
really
ridiculous
preparations
,
*NL*
though
your
assisting
them
is
a
proof
of
your
kindness
.
There
is
*NL*
something
so
inexpressibly
absurd
to
me
in
the
idea
of
Caddy
being
*NL*
married
!
Oh
,
Caddy
,
you
silly
,
silly
,
silly
puss
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
upstairs
with
us
notwithstanding
and
looked
at
the
clothes
*NL*
in
her
customary
far-off
manner
.
They
suggested
one
distinct
idea
to
*NL*
her
,
for
she
said
with
her
placid
smile
,
and
shaking
her
head
,
``
My
*NL*
good
Miss
Summerson
,
at
half
the
cost
,
this
weak
child
might
have
*NL*
been
equipped
for
Africa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
going
downstairs
again
,
Mrs.
Jellyby
asked
me
whether
this
*NL*
troublesome
business
was
really
to
take
place
next
Wednesday
.
And
on
*NL*
my
replying
yes
,
she
said
,
``
Will
my
room
be
required
,
my
dear
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
?
For
it
's
quite
impossible
that
I
can
put
my
papers
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
liberty
of
saying
that
the
room
would
certainly
be
wanted
*NL*
and
that
I
thought
we
must
put
the
papers
away
somewhere
.
``
Well
,
my
*NL*
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
``
you
know
best
,
I
dare
say
.
*NL*
But
by
obliging
me
to
employ
a
boy
,
Caddy
has
embarrassed
me
to
that
*NL*
extent
,
overwhelmed
as
I
am
with
public
business
,
that
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
which
way
to
turn
.
We
have
a
Ramification
meeting
,
too
,
on
Wednesday
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
the
inconvenience
is
very
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
likely
to
occur
again
,
''
said
I
,
smiling
.
``
Caddy
will
be
*NL*
married
but
once
,
probably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
Mrs.
Jellyby
replied
;
``
that
's
true
,
my
dear
.
I
suppose
*NL*
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
question
was
how
Mrs.
Jellyby
should
be
dressed
on
the
*NL*
occasion
.
I
thought
it
very
curious
to
see
her
looking
on
serenely
*NL*
from
her
writing-table
while
Caddy
and
I
discussed
it
,
occasionally
*NL*
shaking
her
head
at
us
with
a
half-reproachful
smile
like
a
superior
*NL*
spirit
who
could
just
bear
with
our
trifling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
state
in
which
her
dresses
were
,
and
the
extraordinary
confusion
*NL*
in
which
she
kept
them
,
added
not
a
little
to
our
difficulty
;
but
at
*NL*
length
we
devised
something
not
very
unlike
what
a
common-place
*NL*
mother
might
wear
on
such
an
occasion
.
The
abstracted
manner
in
which
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
would
deliver
herself
up
to
having
this
attire
tried
on
*NL*
by
the
dressmaker
,
and
the
sweetness
with
which
she
would
then
*NL*
observe
to
me
how
sorry
she
was
that
I
had
not
turned
my
thoughts
to
*NL*
Africa
,
were
consistent
with
the
rest
of
her
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodging
was
rather
confined
as
to
space
,
but
I
fancied
that
if
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
household
had
been
the
only
lodgers
in
Saint
Paul
's
or
*NL*
Saint
Peter
's
,
the
sole
advantage
they
would
have
found
in
the
size
*NL*
of
the
building
would
have
been
its
affording
a
great
deal
of
room
to
*NL*
be
dirty
in
.
I
believe
that
nothing
belonging
to
the
family
which
it
*NL*
had
been
possible
to
break
was
unbroken
at
the
time
of
those
*NL*
preparations
for
Caddy
's
marriage
,
that
nothing
which
it
had
been
*NL*
possible
to
spoil
in
any
way
was
unspoilt
,
and
that
no
domestic
*NL*
object
which
was
capable
of
collecting
dirt
,
from
a
dear
child
's
knee
*NL*
to
the
door-plate
,
was
without
as
much
dirt
as
could
well
accumulate
*NL*
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Jellyby
,
who
very
seldom
spoke
and
almost
always
sat
when
he
*NL*
was
at
home
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
became
interested
when
he
*NL*
saw
that
Caddy
and
I
were
attempting
to
establish
some
order
among
*NL*
all
this
waste
and
ruin
and
took
off
his
coat
to
help
.
But
such
*NL*
wonderful
things
came
tumbling
out
of
the
closets
when
they
were
*NL*
opened
--
bits
of
mouldy
pie
,
sour
bottles
,
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
caps
,
*NL*
letters
,
tea
,
forks
,
odd
boots
and
shoes
of
children
,
firewood
,
*NL*
wafers
,
saucepan-lids
,
damp
sugar
in
odds
and
ends
of
paper
bags
,
*NL*
footstools
,
blacklead
brushes
,
bread
,
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
bonnets
,
books
*NL*
with
butter
sticking
to
the
binding
,
guttered
candle
ends
put
out
*NL*
by
being
turned
upside
down
in
broken
candlesticks
,
nutshells
,
*NL*
heads
and
tails
of
shrimps
,
dinner-mats
,
gloves
,
coffee-grounds
,
*NL*
umbrellas
--
that
he
looked
frightened
,
and
left
off
again
.
But
he
came
*NL*
regularly
every
evening
and
sat
without
his
coat
,
with
his
head
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
as
though
he
would
have
helped
us
if
he
had
known
*NL*
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Pa
!
''
said
Caddy
to
me
on
the
night
before
the
great
day
,
when
*NL*
we
really
had
got
things
a
little
to
rights
.
``
It
seems
unkind
to
*NL*
leave
him
,
Esther
.
But
what
could
I
do
if
I
stayed
!
Since
I
first
*NL*
knew
you
,
I
have
tidied
and
tidied
over
and
over
again
,
but
it
's
*NL*
useless
.
Ma
and
Africa
,
together
,
upset
the
whole
house
directly
.
We
*NL*
never
have
a
servant
who
do
n't
drink
.
Ma
's
ruinous
to
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jellyby
could
not
hear
what
she
said
,
but
he
seemed
very
low
*NL*
indeed
and
shed
tears
,
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
aches
for
him
;
that
it
does
!
''
sobbed
Caddy
.
``
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
thinking
to-night
,
Esther
,
how
dearly
I
hope
to
be
happy
with
Prince
,
*NL*
and
how
dearly
Pa
hoped
,
I
dare
say
,
to
be
happy
with
Ma
.
What
a
*NL*
disappointed
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Caddy
!
''
said
Mr.
Jellyby
,
looking
slowly
round
from
the
*NL*
wail
.
It
was
the
first
time
,
I
think
,
I
ever
heard
him
say
three
*NL*
words
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Pa
!
''
cried
Caddy
,
going
to
him
and
embracing
him
*NL*
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Caddy
,
''
said
Mr.
Jellyby
.
``
Never
have
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Prince
,
Pa
?
''
faltered
Caddy
.
``
Not
have
Prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Jellyby
.
``
Have
him
,
certainly
.
But
,
never
*NL*
have
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
in
my
account
of
our
first
visit
in
Thavies
Inn
that
*NL*
Richard
described
Mr.
Jellyby
as
frequently
opening
his
mouth
after
*NL*
dinner
without
saying
anything
.
It
was
a
habit
of
his
.
He
opened
his
*NL*
mouth
now
a
great
many
times
and
shook
his
head
in
a
melancholy
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
me
not
to
have
?
Do
n't
have
what
,
dear
Pa
?
''
asked
*NL*
Caddy
,
coaxing
him
,
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
have
a
mission
,
my
dear
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jellyby
groaned
and
laid
his
head
against
the
wall
again
,
and
*NL*
this
was
the
only
time
I
ever
heard
him
make
any
approach
to
*NL*
expressing
his
sentiments
on
the
Borrioboolan
question
.
I
suppose
he
*NL*
had
been
more
talkative
and
lively
once
,
but
he
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
completely
exhausted
long
before
I
knew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Mrs.
Jellyby
never
would
have
left
off
serenely
looking
*NL*
over
her
papers
and
drinking
coffee
that
night
.
It
was
twelve
o'clock
*NL*
before
we
could
obtain
possession
of
the
room
,
and
the
clearance
it
*NL*
required
then
was
so
discouraging
that
Caddy
,
who
was
almost
tired
*NL*
out
,
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
dust
and
cried
.
But
she
soon
*NL*
cheered
up
,
and
we
did
wonders
with
it
before
we
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
it
looked
,
by
the
aid
of
a
few
flowers
and
a
quantity
*NL*
of
soap
and
water
and
a
little
arrangement
,
quite
gay
.
The
plain
*NL*
breakfast
made
a
cheerful
show
,
and
Caddy
was
perfectly
charming
.
But
*NL*
when
my
darling
came
,
I
thought
--
and
I
think
now
--
that
I
never
had
*NL*
seen
such
a
dear
face
as
my
beautiful
pet
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
a
little
feast
for
the
children
upstairs
,
and
we
put
Peepy
at
*NL*
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
we
showed
them
Caddy
in
her
bridal
dress
,
*NL*
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
hurrahed
,
and
Caddy
cried
to
think
*NL*
that
she
was
going
away
from
them
and
hugged
them
over
and
over
again
*NL*
until
we
brought
Prince
up
to
fetch
her
away
--
when
,
I
am
sorry
to
*NL*
say
,
Peepy
bit
him
.
Then
there
was
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
downstairs
,
in
*NL*
a
state
of
deportment
not
to
be
expressed
,
benignly
blessing
Caddy
*NL*
and
giving
my
guardian
to
understand
that
his
son
's
happiness
was
his
*NL*
own
parental
work
and
that
he
sacrificed
personal
considerations
to
*NL*
ensure
it
.
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
these
young
people
*NL*
will
live
with
me
;
my
house
is
large
enough
for
their
accommodation
,
*NL*
and
they
shall
not
want
the
shelter
of
my
roof
.
I
could
have
*NL*
wished
--
you
will
understand
the
allusion
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
for
you
*NL*
remember
my
illustrious
patron
the
Prince
Regent
--
I
could
have
*NL*
wished
that
my
son
had
married
into
a
family
where
there
was
more
*NL*
deportment
,
but
the
will
of
heaven
be
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pardiggle
were
of
the
party
--
Mr.
Pardiggle
,
an
*NL*
obstinate-looking
man
with
a
large
waistcoat
and
stubbly
hair
,
who
*NL*
was
always
talking
in
a
loud
bass
voice
about
his
mite
,
or
Mrs.
*NL*
Pardiggle
's
mite
,
or
their
five
boys
'
mites
.
Mr.
Quale
,
with
his
hair
*NL*
brushed
back
as
usual
and
his
knobs
of
temples
shining
very
much
,
was
*NL*
also
there
,
not
in
the
character
of
a
disappointed
lover
,
but
as
the
*NL*
accepted
of
a
young
--
at
least
,
an
unmarried
--
lady
,
a
Miss
Wisk
,
who
*NL*
was
also
there
.
Miss
Wisk
's
mission
,
my
guardian
said
,
was
to
show
*NL*
the
world
that
woman
's
mission
was
man
's
mission
and
that
the
only
*NL*
genuine
mission
of
both
man
and
woman
was
to
be
always
moving
*NL*
declaratory
resolutions
about
things
in
general
at
public
meetings
.
*NL*
The
guests
were
few
,
but
were
,
as
one
might
expect
at
Mrs.
Jellyby
's
,
*NL*
all
devoted
to
public
objects
only
.
Besides
those
I
have
mentioned
,
*NL*
there
was
an
extremely
dirty
lady
with
her
bonnet
all
awry
and
the
*NL*
ticketed
price
of
her
dress
still
sticking
on
it
,
whose
neglected
*NL*
home
,
Caddy
told
me
,
was
like
a
filthy
wilderness
,
but
whose
church
*NL*
was
like
a
fancy
fair
.
A
very
contentious
gentleman
,
who
said
it
was
*NL*
his
mission
to
be
everybody
's
brother
but
who
appeared
to
be
on
terms
*NL*
of
coolness
with
the
whole
of
his
large
family
,
completed
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
party
,
having
less
in
common
with
such
an
occasion
,
could
hardly
*NL*
have
been
got
together
by
any
ingenuity
.
Such
a
mean
mission
as
the
*NL*
domestic
mission
was
the
very
last
thing
to
be
endured
among
them
;
*NL*
indeed
,
Miss
Wisk
informed
us
,
with
great
indignation
,
before
we
sat
*NL*
down
to
breakfast
,
that
the
idea
of
woman
's
mission
lying
chiefly
in
*NL*
the
narrow
sphere
of
home
was
an
outrageous
slander
on
the
part
of
*NL*
her
tyrant
,
man
.
One
other
singularity
was
that
nobody
with
a
*NL*
mission
--
except
Mr.
Quale
,
whose
mission
,
as
I
think
I
have
formerly
*NL*
said
,
was
to
be
in
ecstasies
with
everybody
's
mission
--
cared
at
all
*NL*
for
anybody
's
mission
.
Mrs.
Pardiggle
being
as
clear
that
the
only
*NL*
one
infallible
course
was
her
course
of
pouncing
upon
the
poor
and
*NL*
applying
benevolence
to
them
like
a
strait-waistcoat
;
as
Miss
Wisk
*NL*
was
that
the
only
practical
thing
for
the
world
was
the
emancipation
*NL*
of
woman
from
the
thraldom
of
her
tyrant
,
man
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
all
the
*NL*
while
,
sat
smiling
at
the
limited
vision
that
could
see
anything
but
*NL*
Borrioboola-Gha
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
am
anticipating
now
the
purport
of
our
conversation
on
the
ride
*NL*
home
instead
of
first
marrying
Caddy
.
We
all
went
to
church
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Jellyby
gave
her
away
.
Of
the
air
with
which
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
with
*NL*
his
hat
under
his
left
arm
-LRB-
the
inside
presented
at
the
clergyman
*NL*
like
a
cannon
-RRB-
and
his
eyes
creasing
themselves
up
into
his
wig
,
*NL*
stood
stiff
and
high-shouldered
behind
us
bridesmaids
during
the
*NL*
ceremony
,
and
afterwards
saluted
us
,
I
could
never
say
enough
to
do
*NL*
it
justice
.
Miss
Wisk
,
whom
I
can
not
report
as
prepossessing
in
*NL*
appearance
,
and
whose
manner
was
grim
,
listened
to
the
proceedings
,
*NL*
as
part
of
woman
's
wrongs
,
with
a
disdainful
face
.
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
with
*NL*
her
calm
smile
and
her
bright
eyes
,
looked
the
least
concerned
of
all
*NL*
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
duly
came
back
to
breakfast
,
and
Mrs.
Jellyby
sat
at
the
head
of
*NL*
the
table
and
Mr.
Jellyby
at
the
foot
.
Caddy
had
previously
stolen
*NL*
upstairs
to
hug
the
children
again
and
tell
them
that
her
name
was
*NL*
Turveydrop
.
But
this
piece
of
information
,
instead
of
being
an
*NL*
agreeable
surprise
to
Peepy
,
threw
him
on
his
back
in
such
transports
*NL*
of
kicking
grief
that
I
could
do
nothing
on
being
sent
for
but
accede
*NL*
to
the
proposal
that
he
should
be
admitted
to
the
breakfast
table
.
So
*NL*
he
came
down
and
sat
in
my
lap
;
and
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
after
saying
,
in
*NL*
reference
to
the
state
of
his
pinafore
,
``
Oh
,
you
naughty
Peepy
,
what
*NL*
a
shocking
little
pig
you
are
!
''
was
not
at
all
discomposed
.
He
was
*NL*
very
good
except
that
he
brought
down
Noah
with
him
-LRB-
out
of
an
ark
I
*NL*
had
given
him
before
we
went
to
church
-RRB-
and
WOULD
dip
him
head
first
*NL*
into
the
wine-glasses
and
then
put
him
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
,
with
his
sweet
temper
and
his
quick
perception
and
his
*NL*
amiable
face
,
made
something
agreeable
even
out
of
the
ungenial
*NL*
company
.
None
of
them
seemed
able
to
talk
about
anything
but
his
,
or
*NL*
her
,
own
one
subject
,
and
none
of
them
seemed
able
to
talk
about
even
*NL*
that
as
part
of
a
world
in
which
there
was
anything
else
;
but
my
*NL*
guardian
turned
it
all
to
the
merry
encouragement
of
Caddy
and
the
*NL*
honour
of
the
occasion
,
and
brought
us
through
the
breakfast
nobly
.
*NL*
What
we
should
have
done
without
him
,
I
am
afraid
to
think
,
for
all
*NL*
the
company
despising
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
old
Mr.
*NL*
Turveydrop
--
and
old
Mr.
Thurveydrop
,
in
virtue
of
his
deportment
,
*NL*
considering
himself
vastly
superior
to
all
the
company
--
it
was
a
very
*NL*
unpromising
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
time
came
when
poor
Caddy
was
to
go
and
when
all
her
*NL*
property
was
packed
on
the
hired
coach
and
pair
that
was
to
take
her
*NL*
and
her
husband
to
Gravesend
.
It
affected
us
to
see
Caddy
clinging
,
*NL*
then
,
to
her
deplorable
home
and
hanging
on
her
mother
's
neck
with
*NL*
the
greatest
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
I
could
n't
go
on
writing
from
dictation
,
Ma
,
''
sobbed
*NL*
Caddy
.
``
I
hope
you
forgive
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Caddy
,
Caddy
!
''
said
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
``
I
have
told
you
over
and
over
*NL*
again
that
I
have
engaged
a
boy
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
you
are
not
the
least
angry
with
me
,
Ma
?
Say
you
are
*NL*
sure
before
I
go
away
,
Ma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
foolish
Caddy
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Jellyby
,
``
do
I
look
angry
,
or
have
*NL*
I
inclination
to
be
angry
,
or
time
to
be
angry
?
How
CAN
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
little
care
of
Pa
while
I
am
gone
,
Mama
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jellyby
positively
laughed
at
the
fancy
.
``
You
romantic
child
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
lightly
patting
Caddy
's
back
.
``
Go
along
.
I
am
excellent
*NL*
friends
with
you
.
Now
,
good-bye
,
Caddy
,
and
be
very
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Caddy
hung
upon
her
father
and
nursed
his
cheek
against
hers
as
*NL*
if
he
were
some
poor
dull
child
in
pain
.
All
this
took
place
in
the
*NL*
hall
.
Her
father
released
her
,
took
out
his
pocket
handkerchief
,
and
*NL*
sat
down
on
the
stairs
with
his
head
against
the
wall
.
I
hope
he
*NL*
found
some
consolation
in
walls
.
I
almost
think
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Prince
took
her
arm
in
his
and
turned
with
great
emotion
and
*NL*
respect
to
his
father
,
whose
deportment
at
that
moment
was
*NL*
overwhelming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
over
and
over
again
,
father
!
''
said
Prince
,
kissing
his
*NL*
hand
.
``
I
am
very
grateful
for
all
your
kindness
and
consideration
*NL*
regarding
our
marriage
,
and
so
,
I
can
assure
you
,
is
Caddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
''
sobbed
Caddy
.
``
Ve-ry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
son
,
''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
and
dear
daughter
,
I
have
done
*NL*
my
duty

If
the
spirit
of

wooman
hovers

us
and
looks
*NL*
down
on
the
occasion
,
that
,
and
your
constant
affection

will
be
my
*NL*
recompense

You
will
not

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

said
Caddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This

returned
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
is
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

We
shall
return

this
day

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
``
let
me
,
even
under
the
present

exceptional

recommend
strict
punctuality

It

highly

important
to
keep
the
connexion
together
;
and
schools
,
if
at
all

are
apt

take

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This

we
shall
be
sure
to
be
home
to

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

''
said
Mr.
Turveydrop
.
``
You
will
find
fires
,
my

Caroline

*NL*
in
your

Yes
,
yes

*NL*
Prince
!
''
anticipating
some
self-denying
objection
on
his
son
's
part
*NL*
with
a
great
air
.
``
You
and
our
Caroline
will
be
strange
in
the
upper
*NL*
part
of
the
premises

will

therefore

dine
that
day
in
my
*NL*
apartment

Now
,
bless

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
away
,
and
whether
I
wondered
most
at
Mrs.
Jellyby
or
at
*NL*
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
I
did
not
know
.
Ada
and
my
guardian
were
in
the
same
*NL*
condition
when
we
came
to
talk
it
over
.
But
before
we
drove
away
too
,
*NL*
I
received
a
most
unexpected
and
eloquent
compliment
from
Mr.
*NL*
Jellyby
.
He
came
up
to
me
in
the
hall
,
took
both
my
hands
,
pressed
*NL*
them
earnestly
,
and
opened
his
mouth
twice
.
I
was
so
sure
of
his
*NL*
meaning
that
I
said
,
quite
flurried
,
``
You
are
very
welcome
,
sir
.
Pray
*NL*
do
n't
mention
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
this
marriage
is
for
the
best
,
guardian
,
''
said
I
when
we
*NL*
three
were
on
our
road
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
is
,
little
woman
.
Patience
.
We
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
wind
in
the
east
to-day
?
''
I
ventured
to
ask
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
heartily
and
answered
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
must
have
been
this
morning
,
I
think
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
``
No
''
again
,
and
this
time
my
dear
girl
confidently
*NL*
answered
``
No
''
too
and
shook
the
lovely
head
which
,
with
its
blooming
*NL*
flowers
against
the
golden
hair
,
was
like
the
very
spring
.
``
Much
YOU
*NL*
know
of
east
winds
,
my
ugly
darling
,
''
said
I
,
kissing
her
in
my
*NL*
admiration
--
I
could
n't
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
!
It
was
only
their
love
for
me
,
I
know
very
well
,
and
it
is
a
*NL*
long
time
ago
.
I
must
write
it
even
if
I
rub
it
out
again
,
because
it
*NL*
gives
me
so
much
pleasure
.
They
said
there
could
be
no
east
wind
*NL*
where
Somebody
was
;
they
said
that
wherever
Dame
Durden
went
,
there
*NL*
was
sunshine
and
summer
air
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
Nurse
and
Patient
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
at
home
again
many
days
when
one
evening
I
went
*NL*
upstairs
into
my
own
room
to
take
a
peep
over
Charley
's
shoulder
and
*NL*
see
how
she
was
getting
on
with
her
copy-book
.
Writing
was
a
trying
*NL*
business
to
Charley
,
who
seemed
to
have
no
natural
power
over
a
pen
,
*NL*
but
in
whose
hand
every
pen
appeared
to
become
perversely
animated
,
*NL*
and
to
go
wrong
and
crooked
,
and
to
stop
,
and
splash
,
and
sidle
into
*NL*
corners
like
a
saddle-donkey
.
It
was
very
odd
to
see
what
old
letters
*NL*
Charley
's
young
hand
had
made
,
they
so
wrinkled
,
and
shrivelled
,
and
*NL*
tottering
,
it
so
plump
and
round
.
Yet
Charley
was
uncommonly
expert
*NL*
at
other
things
and
had
as
nimble
little
fingers
as
I
ever
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
looking
over
a
copy
of
the
letter
O
in
which
*NL*
it
was
represented
as
square
,
triangular
,
pear-shaped
,
and
collapsed
*NL*
in
all
kinds
of
ways
,
``
we
are
improving
.
If
we
only
get
to
make
it
*NL*
round
,
we
shall
be
perfect
,
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
made
one
,
and
Charley
made
one
,
and
the
pen
would
n't
join
*NL*
Charley
's
neatly
,
but
twisted
it
up
into
a
knot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
Charley
.
We
shall
do
it
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
laid
down
her
pen
,
the
copy
being
finished
,
opened
and
shut
*NL*
her
cramped
little
hand
,
looked
gravely
at
the
page
,
half
in
pride
*NL*
and
half
in
doubt
,
and
got
up
,
and
dropped
me
a
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
miss
.
If
you
please
,
miss
,
did
you
know
a
poor
person
of
*NL*
the
name
of
Jenny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brickmaker
's
wife
,
Charley
?
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
came
and
spoke
to
me
when
I
was
out
a
little
while
ago
,
and
said
*NL*
you
knew
her
,
miss
.
She
asked
me
if
I
was
n't
the
young
lady
's
little
*NL*
maid
--
meaning
you
for
the
young
lady
,
miss
--
and
I
said
yes
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
she
had
left
this
neighbourhood
altogether
,
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
had
,
miss
,
but
she
's
come
back
again
to
where
she
used
to
*NL*
live
--
she
and
Liz
.
Did
you
know
another
poor
person
of
the
name
of
*NL*
Liz
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
,
Charley
,
though
not
by
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
she
said
!
''
returned
Charley
.
``
They
have
both
come
back
,
*NL*
miss
,
and
have
been
tramping
high
and
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tramping
high
and
low
,
have
they
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
.
''
If
Charley
could
only
have
made
the
letters
in
her
copy
*NL*
as
round
as
the
eyes
with
which
she
looked
into
my
face
,
they
would
*NL*
have
been
excellent
.
``
And
this
poor
person
came
about
the
house
three
*NL*
or
four
days
,
hoping
to
get
a
glimpse
of
you
,
miss
--
all
she
wanted
,
*NL*
she
said
--
but
you
were
away
.
That
was
when
she
saw
me
.
She
saw
me
*NL*
a-going
about
,
miss
,
''
said
Charley
with
a
short
laugh
of
the
greatest
*NL*
delight
and
pride
,
``
and
she
thought
I
looked
like
your
maid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
though
,
really
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
!
''
said
Charley
.
``
Really
and
truly
.
''
And
Charley
,
with
*NL*
another
short
laugh
of
the
purest
glee
,
made
her
eyes
very
round
*NL*
again
and
looked
as
serious
as
became
my
maid
.
I
was
never
tired
of
*NL*
seeing
Charley
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
that
great
dignity
,
standing
*NL*
before
me
with
her
youthful
face
and
figure
,
and
her
steady
manner
,
*NL*
and
her
childish
exultation
breaking
through
it
now
and
then
in
the
*NL*
pleasantest
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
did
you
see
her
,
Charley
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
My
little
maid
's
countenance
fell
as
she
replied
,
``
By
the
doctor
's
*NL*
shop
,
miss
.
''
For
Charley
wore
her
black
frock
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
if
the
brickmaker
's
wife
were
ill
,
but
Charley
said
no
.
It
*NL*
was
some
one
else
.
Some
one
in
her
cottage
who
had
tramped
down
to
*NL*
Saint
Albans
and
was
tramping
he
did
n't
know
where
.
A
poor
boy
,
*NL*
Charley
said
.
No
father
,
no
mother
,
no
any
one
.
``
Like
as
Tom
might
*NL*
have
been
,
miss
,
if
Emma
and
me
had
died
after
father

said
Charley
,
*NL*
her
round
eyes
filling
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
was
getting
medicine
for
him
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
,
miss
,
''
returned
Charley
,
``
how
that
he
had
once
done
as
*NL*
much
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
little
maid
's
face
was
so
eager
and
her
quiet
hands
were
folded
so
*NL*
closely
in
one
another
as
she
stood
looking
at
me
that
I
had
no
great
*NL*
difficulty
in
reading
her
thoughts
.
``
Well
,
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
*NL*
appears
to
me
that
you
and
I
can
do
no
better
than
go
round
to
*NL*
Jenny
's
and
see
what
's
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
alacrity
with
which
Charley
brought
my
bonnet
and
veil
,
and
*NL*
having
dressed
me
,
quaintly
pinned
herself
into
her
warm
shawl
and
*NL*
made
herself
look
like
a
little
old
woman
,
sufficiently
expressed
her
*NL*
readiness
.
So
Charley
and
I
,
without
saying
anything
to
any
one
,
went
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cold
,
wild
night
,
and
the
trees
shuddered
in
the
wind
.
The
*NL*
rain
had
been
thick
and
heavy
all
day
,
and
with
little
intermission
*NL*
for
many
days
.
None
was
falling
just
then
,
however
.
The
sky
had
*NL*
partly
cleared
,
but
was
very
gloomy
--
even
above
us
,
where
a
few
stars
*NL*
were
shining
.
In
the
north
and
north-west
,
where
the
sun
had
set
*NL*
three
hours
before
,
there
was
a
pale
dead
light
both
beautiful
and
*NL*
awful
;
and
into
it
long
sullen
lines
of
cloud
waved
up
like
a
sea
*NL*
stricken
immovable
as
it
was
heaving
.
Towards
London
a
lurid
glare
*NL*
overhung
the
whole
dark
waste
,
and
the
contrast
between
these
two
*NL*
lights
,
and
the
fancy
which
the
redder
light
engendered
of
an
*NL*
unearthly
fire
,
gleaming
on
all
the
unseen
buildings
of
the
city
and
*NL*
on
all
the
faces
of
its
many
thousands
of
wondering
inhabitants
,
was
*NL*
as
solemn
as
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
thought
that
night
--
none
,
I
am
quite
sure
--
of
what
was
soon
*NL*
to
happen
to
me
.
But
I
have
always
remembered
since
that
when
we
had
*NL*
stopped
at
the
garden-gate
to
look
up
at
the
sky
,
and
when
we
went
*NL*
upon
our
way
,
I
had
for
a
moment
an
undefinable
impression
of
myself
*NL*
as
being
something
different
from
what
I
then
was
.
I
know
it
was
then
*NL*
and
there
that
I
had
it
.
I
have
ever
since
connected
the
feeling
with
*NL*
that
spot
and
time
and
with
everything
associated
with
that
spot
and
*NL*
time
,
to
the
distant
voices
in
the
town
,
the
barking
of
a
dog
,
and
*NL*
the
sound
of
wheels
coming
down
the
miry
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Saturday
night
,
and
most
of
the
people
belonging
to
the
place
*NL*
where
we
were
going
were
drinking
elsewhere
.
We
found
it
quieter
than
*NL*
I
had
previously
seen
it
,
though
quite
as
miserable
.
The
kilns
were
*NL*
burning
,
and
a
stifling
vapour
set
towards
us
with
a
pale-blue
glare
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
to
the
cottage
,
where
there
was
a
feeble
candle
in
the
*NL*
patched
window
.
We
tapped
at
the
door
and
went
in
.
The
mother
of
the
*NL*
little
child
who
had
died
was
sitting
in
a
chair
on
one
side
of
the
*NL*
poor
fire
by
the
bed
;
and
opposite
to
her
,
a
wretched
boy
,
supported
*NL*
by
the
chimney-piece
,
was
cowering
on
the
floor
.
He
held
under
his
*NL*
arm
,
like
a
little
bundle
,
a
fragment
of
a
fur
cap
;
and
as
he
tried
*NL*
to
warm
himself
,
he
shook
until
the
crazy
door
and
window
shook
.
The
*NL*
place
was
closer
than
before
and
had
an
unhealthy
and
a
very
peculiar
*NL*
smell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
lifted
my
veil
when
I
first
spoke
to
the
woman
,
which
was
*NL*
at
the
moment
of
our
going
in
.
The
boy
staggered
up
instantly
and
*NL*
stared
at
me
with
a
remarkable
expression
of
surprise
and
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
action
was
so
quick
and
my
being
the
cause
of
it
was
so
evident
*NL*
that
I
stood
still
instead
of
advancing
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
go
no
more
to
the
berryin
ground
,
''
muttered
the
boy
;
``
I
*NL*
ai
n't
a-going
there
,
so
I
tell
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
lifted
my
veil
and
spoke
to
the
woman
.
She
said
to
me
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
,
``
Do
n't
mind
him
,
ma'am
.
He
'll
soon
come
back
to
his
head
,
''
and
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Jo
,
Jo
,
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
wot
she
's
come
for
!
''
cried
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
there
.
She
's
come
to
get
me
to
go
along
with
her
to
the
*NL*
berryin
ground
.
I
wo
n't
go
to
the
berryin
ground
.
I
do
n't
like
the
*NL*
name
on
it
.
She
might
go
a-berryin
ME
.
''
His
shivering
came
on
again
,
*NL*
and
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
,
he
shook
the
hovel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
talking
off
and
on
about
such
like
all
day
,
ma'am
,
''
said
*NL*
Jenny
softly
.
``
Why
,
how
you
stare
!
This
is
MY
lady
,
Jo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
returned
the
boy
doubtfully
,
and
surveying
me
with
his
arm
*NL*
held
out
above
his
burning
eyes
.
``
She
looks
to
me
the
t
`
other
one
.
It
*NL*
ai
n't
the
bonnet
,
nor
yet
it
ai
n't
the
gownd
,
but
she
looks
to
me
the
*NL*
t
`
other
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
little
Charley
,
with
her
premature
experience
of
illness
and
*NL*
trouble
,
had
pulled
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
now
went
quietly
up
*NL*
to
him
with
a
chair
and
sat
him
down
in
it
like
an
old
sick
nurse
.
*NL*
Except
that
no
such
attendant
could
have
shown
him
Charley
's
youthful
*NL*
face
,
which
seemed
to
engage
his
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
''
said
the
boy
.
``
YOU
tell
me
.
Ai
n't
the
lady
the
t
`
other
*NL*
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
shook
her
head
as
she
methodically
drew
his
rags
about
him
*NL*
and
made
him
as
warm
as
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
the
boy
muttered
.
``
Then
I
s
`
pose
she
ai
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
see
if
I
could
do
you
any
good
,
''
said
I.
``
What
is
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a-being
froze
,
''
returned
the
boy
hoarsely
,
with
his
haggard
gaze
*NL*
wandering
about
me
,
``
and
then
burnt
up
,
and
then
froze
,
and
then
*NL*
burnt
up
,
ever
so
many
times
in
a
hour
.
And
my
head
's
all
sleepy
,
and
*NL*
all
a-going
mad-like
--
and
I
'm
so
dry
--
and
my
bones
is
n't
half
so
much
*NL*
bones
as
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
he
come
here
?
''
I
asked
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
,
ma'am
,
I
found
him
at
the
corner
of
the
town
.
I
had
*NL*
known
him
up
in
London
yonder
.
Had
n't
I
,
Jo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
''
the
boy
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
he
fixed
his
attention
or
his
eyes
,
it
was
only
for
a
very
*NL*
little
while
.
He
soon
began
to
droop
his
head
again
,
and
roll
it
*NL*
heavily
,
and
speak
as
if
he
were
half
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
he
come
from
London
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
London
yes
`
day
,
''
said
the
boy
himself
,
now
flushed
and
*NL*
hot
.
``
I
'm
a-going
somewheres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
going
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somewheres
,
''
repeated
the
boy
in
a
louder
tone
.
``
I
have
been
moved
*NL*
on
,
and
moved
on
,
more
nor
ever
I
was
afore
,
since
the
t
`
other
one
*NL*
give
me
the
sov
`
ring
.
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
she
's
always
a-watching
,
and
*NL*
a-driving
of
me
--
what
have
I
done
to
her
?
--
and
they
're
all
a-watching
*NL*
and
a-driving
of
me
.
Every
one
of
'em
's
doing
of
it
,
from
the
time
*NL*
when
I
do
n't
get
up
,
to
the
time
when
I
do
n't
go
to
bed
.
And
I
'm
*NL*
a-going
somewheres
.
That
's
where
I
'm
a-going
.
She
told
me
,
down
in
*NL*
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
as
she
came
from
Stolbuns
,
and
so
I
took
the
*NL*
Stolbuns
Road
.
It
's
as
good
as
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
always
concluded
by
addressing
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
with
him
?
''
said
I
,
taking
the
woman
aside
.
``
He
*NL*
could
not
travel
in
this
state
even
if
he
had
a
purpose
and
knew
*NL*
where
he
was
going
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
no
more
,
ma'am
,
than
the
dead
,
''
she
replied
,
glancing
*NL*
compassionately
at
him
.
``
Perhaps
the
dead
know
better
,
if
they
could
*NL*
only
tell
us
.
I
've
kept
him
here
all
day
for
pity
's
sake
,
and
I
've
*NL*
given
him
broth
and
physic
,
and
Liz
has
gone
to
try
if
any
one
will
*NL*
take
him
in
-LRB-
here
's
my
pretty
in
the
bed
--
her
child
,
but
I
call
it
*NL*
mine
-RRB-
;
but
I
ca
n't
keep
him
long
,
for
if
my
husband
was
to
come
home
*NL*
and
find
him
here
,
he
'd
be
rough
in
putting
him
out
and
might
do
him
*NL*
a
hurt
.
Hark
!
Here
comes
Liz
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
woman
came
hurriedly
in
as
she
spoke
,
and
the
boy
got
up
*NL*
with
a
half-obscured
sense
that
he
was
expected
to
be
going
.
When
the
*NL*
little
child
awoke
,
and
when
and
how
Charley
got
at
it
,
took
it
out
*NL*
of
bed
,
and
began
to
walk
about
hushing
it
,
I
do
n't
know
.
There
she
*NL*
was
,
doing
all
this
in
a
quiet
motherly
manner
as
if
she
were
living
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Blinder
's
attic
with
Tom
and
Emma
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
had
been
here
and
there
,
and
had
been
played
about
from
*NL*
hand
to
hand
,
and
had
come
back
as
she
went
.
At
first
it
was
too
*NL*
early
for
the
boy
to
be
received
into
the
proper
refuge
,
and
at
last
*NL*
it
was
too
late
.
One
official
sent
her
to
another
,
and
the
other
sent
*NL*
her
back
again
to
the
first
,
and
so
backward
and
forward
,
until
it
*NL*
appeared
to
me
as
if
both
must
have
been
appointed
for
their
skill
in
*NL*
evading
their
duties
instead
of
performing
them
.
And
now
,
after
all
,
*NL*
she
said
,
breathing
quickly
,
for
she
had
been
running
and
was
*NL*
frightened
too
,
``
Jenny
,
your
master
's
on
the
road
home
,
and
mine
's
*NL*
not
far
behind
,
and
the
Lord
help
the
boy
,
for
we
can
do
no
more
for
*NL*
him
!
''
They
put
a
few
halfpence
together
and
hurried
them
into
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
so
,
in
an
oblivious
,
half-thankful
,
half-insensible
way
,
he
*NL*
shuffled
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
the
child
,
my
dear
,
''
said
its
mother
to
Charley
,
``
and
thank
*NL*
you
kindly
too
!
Jenny
,
woman
dear
,
good
night
!
Young
lady
,
if
my
*NL*
master
do
n't
fall
out
with
me
,
I
'll
look
down
by
the
kiln
by
and
by
,
*NL*
where
the
boy
will
be
most
like
,
and
again
in
the
morning
!
''
She
*NL*
hurried
off
,
and
presently
we
passed
her
hushing
and
singing
to
her
*NL*
child
at
her
own
door
and
looking
anxiously
along
the
road
for
her
*NL*
drunken
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
afraid
of
staying
then
to
speak
to
either
woman
,
lest
I
should
*NL*
bring
her
into
trouble
.
But
I
said
to
Charley
that
we
must
not
leave
*NL*
the
boy
to
die
.
Charley
,
who
knew
what
to
do
much
better
than
I
did
,
*NL*
and
whose
quickness
equalled
her
presence
of
mind
,
glided
on
before
*NL*
me
,
and
presently
we
came
up
with
Jo
,
just
short
of
the
brick-kiln
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
he
must
have
begun
his
journey
with
some
small
bundle
under
*NL*
his
arm
and
must
have
had
it
stolen
or
lost
it
.
For
he
still
carried
*NL*
his
wretched
fragment
of
fur
cap
like
a
bundle
,
though
he
went
*NL*
bare-headed
through
the
rain
,
which
now
fell
fast
.
He
stopped
when
we
*NL*
called
to
him
and
again
showed
a
dread
of
me
when
I
came
up
,
standing
*NL*
with
his
lustrous
eyes
fixed
upon
me
,
and
even
arrested
in
his
*NL*
shivering
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
to
come
with
us
,
and
we
would
take
care
that
he
had
some
*NL*
shelter
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
no
shelter
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
can
lay
amongst
the
warm
*NL*
bricks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
you
know
that
people
die
there
?
''
replied
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
dies
everywheres
,
''
said
the
boy
.
``
They
dies
in
their
*NL*
lodgings
--
she
knows
where
;
I
showed
her
--
and
they
dies
down
in
*NL*
Tom-all-Alone
's
in
heaps
.
They
dies
more
than
they
lives
,
according
*NL*
to
what
I
see
.
''
Then
he
hoarsely
whispered
Charley
,
``
If
she
ai
n't
the
*NL*
t
`
other
one
,
she
ai
n't
the
forrenner
.
Is
there
THREE
of
'em
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
looked
at
me
a
little
frightened
.
I
felt
half
frightened
at
*NL*
myself
when
the
boy
glared
on
me
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
turned
and
followed
when
I
beckoned
to
him
,
and
finding
that
*NL*
he
acknowledged
that
influence
in
me
,
I
led
the
way
straight
home
.
It
*NL*
was
not
far
,
only
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
We
passed
but
one
man
.
I
*NL*
doubted
if
we
should
have
got
home
without
assistance
,
the
boy
's
*NL*
steps
were
so
uncertain
and
tremulous
.
He
made
no
complaint
,
however
,
*NL*
and
was
strangely
unconcerned
about
himself
,
if
I
may
say
so
strange
*NL*
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
him
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
,
shrunk
into
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
window-seat
and
staring
with
an
indifference
that
scarcely
could
be
*NL*
called
wonder
at
the
comfort
and
brightness
about
him
,
I
went
into
*NL*
the
drawing-room
to
speak
to
my
guardian
.
There
I
found
Mr.
Skimpole
,
*NL*
who
had
come
down
by
the
coach
,
as
he
frequently
did
without
notice
,
*NL*
and
never
bringing
any
clothes
with
him
,
but
always
borrowing
*NL*
everything
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
out
with
me
directly
to
look
at
the
boy
.
The
servants
had
*NL*
gathered
in
the
hall
too
,
and
he
shivered
in
the
window-seat
with
*NL*
Charley
standing
by
him
,
like
some
wounded
animal
that
had
been
found
*NL*
in
a
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
sorrowful
case
,
''
said
my
guardian
after
asking
him
a
*NL*
question
or
two
and
touching
him
and
examining
his
eyes
.
``
What
do
you
*NL*
say
,
Harold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
turn
him
out
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
inquired
my
guardian
,
almost
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
you
know
what
I
am
:
I
am
a
*NL*
child
.
Be
cross
to
me
if
I
deserve
it
.
But
I
have
a
constitutional
*NL*
objection
to
this
sort
of
thing
.
I
always
had
,
when
I
was
a
medical
*NL*
man
.
He
's
not
safe
,
you
know
.
There
's
a
very
bad
sort
of
fever
about
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
had
retreated
from
the
hall
to
the
drawing-room
again
*NL*
and
said
this
in
his
airy
way
,
seated
on
the
music-stool
as
we
stood
*NL*
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
say
it
's
childish
,
''
observed
Mr.
Skimpole
,
looking
gaily
at
*NL*
us
.
``
Well
,
I
dare
say
it
may
be
;
but
I
AM
a
child
,
and
I
never
*NL*
pretend
to
be
anything
else
.
If
you
put
him
out
in
the
road
,
you
only
*NL*
put
him
where
he
was
before
.
He
will
be
no
worse
off
than
he
was
,
you
*NL*
know
.
Even
make
him
better
off
,
if
you
like
.
Give
him
sixpence
,
or
*NL*
five
shillings
,
or
five
pound
ten
--
you
are
arithmeticians
,
and
I
am
*NL*
not
--
and
get
rid
of
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
he
to
do
then
?
''
asked
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
life
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
his
*NL*
engaging
smile
,
``
I
have
not
the
least
idea
what
he
is
to
do
then
.
But
*NL*
I
have
no
doubt
he
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
is
it
not
a
horrible
reflection
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
to
whom
I
*NL*
had
hastily
explained
the
unavailing
efforts
of
the
two
women
,
``
is
it
*NL*
not
a
horrible
reflection
,
''
walking
up
and
down
and
rumpling
his
*NL*
hair
,
``
that
if
this
wretched
creature
were
a
convicted
prisoner
,
his
*NL*
hospital
would
be
wide
open
to
him
,
and
he
would
be
as
well
taken
*NL*
care
of
as
any
sick
boy
in
the
kingdom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
you
'll
pardon
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
the
question
,
coming
as
it
does
from
a
creature
who
is
*NL*
perfectly
simple
in
worldly
matters
,
but
why
IS
N'T
he
a
prisoner
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
stopped
and
looked
at
him
with
a
whimsical
mixture
of
*NL*
amusement
and
indignation
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
young
friend
is
not
to
be
suspected
of
any
delicacy
,
I
should
*NL*
imagine
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
unabashed
and
candid
.
``
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
it
would
be
wiser
,
as
well
as
in
a
certain
kind
of
way
more
*NL*
respectable
,
if
he
showed
some
misdirected
energy
that
got
him
into
*NL*
prison
.
There
would
be
more
of
an
adventurous
spirit
in
it
,
and
*NL*
consequently
more
of
a
certain
sort
of
poetry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
resuming
his
uneasy
walk
,
``
that
*NL*
there
is
not
such
another
child
on
earth
as
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
?
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
I
dare
say
!
But
I
confess
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
why
our
young
friend
,
in
his
degree
,
should
not
seek
to
*NL*
invest
himself
with
such
poetry
as
is
open
to
him
.
He
is
no
doubt
*NL*
born
with
an
appetite
--
probably
,
when
he
is
in
a
safer
state
of
*NL*
health
,
he
has
an
excellent
appetite
.
Very
well
.
At
our
young
*NL*
friend
's
natural
dinner
hour
,
most
likely
about
noon
,
our
young
*NL*
friend
says
in
effect
to
society
,
'
I
am
hungry
;
will
you
have
the
*NL*
goodness
to
produce
your
spoon
and
feed
me
?
'
Society
,
which
has
taken
*NL*
upon
itself
the
general
arrangement
of
the
whole
system
of
spoons
and
*NL*
professes
to
have
a
spoon
for
our
young
friend
,
does
NOT
produce
that
*NL*
spoon
;
and
our
young
friend
,
therefore
,
says
`
You
really
must
excuse
*NL*
me
if
I
seize
it
.
'
Now
,
this
appears
to
me
a
case
of
misdirected
*NL*
energy
,
which
has
a
certain
amount
of
reason
in
it
and
a
certain
*NL*
amount
of
romance
;
and
I
do
n't
know
but
what
I
should
be
more
*NL*
interested
in
our
young
friend
,
as
an
illustration
of
such
a
case
,
*NL*
than
merely
as
a
poor
vagabond
--
which
any
one
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meantime
,
''
I
ventured
to
observe
,
``
he
is
getting
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meantime
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
cheerfully
,
``
as
Miss
Summerson
,
*NL*
with
her
practical
good
sense
,
observes
,
he
is
getting
worse
.
*NL*
Therefore
I
recommend
your
turning
him
out
before
he
gets
still
*NL*
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
amiable
face
with
which
he
said
it
,
I
think
I
shall
never
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
little
woman
,
''
observed
my
guardian
,
turning
to
me
,
``
I
*NL*
can
ensure
his
admission
into
the
proper
place
by
merely
going
there
*NL*
to
enforce
it
,
though
it
's
a
bad
state
of
things
when
,
in
his
*NL*
condition
,
that
is
necessary
.
But
it
's
growing
late
,
and
is
a
very
*NL*
bad
night
,
and
the
boy
is
worn
out
already
.
There
is
a
bed
in
the
*NL*
wholesome
loft-room
by
the
stable
;
we
had
better
keep
him
there
till
*NL*
morning
,
when
he
can
be
wrapped
up
and
removed
.
We
'll
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
with
his
hands
upon
the
keys
of
the
piano
as
*NL*
we
moved
away
.
``
Are
you
going
back
to
our
young
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
envy
you
your
constitution
,
Jarndyce
!
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
*NL*
with
playful
admiration
.
``
You
do
n't
mind
these
things
;
neither
does
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
.
You
are
ready
at
all
times
to
go
anywhere
,
and
do
*NL*
anything
.
Such
is
will
!
I
have
no
will
at
all
--
and
no
wo
n't
--
simply
*NL*
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
recommend
anything
for
the
boy
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
my
*NL*
guardian
,
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
half
angrily
;
only
half
*NL*
angrily
,
for
he
never
seemed
to
consider
Mr.
Skimpole
an
accountable
*NL*
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
I
observed
a
bottle
of
cooling
medicine
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
it
's
impossible
for
him
to
do
better
than
take
it
.
You
*NL*
can
tell
them
to
sprinkle
a
little
vinegar
about
the
place
where
he
*NL*
sleeps
and
to
keep
it
moderately
cool
and
him
moderately
warm
.
But
it
*NL*
is
mere
impertinence
in
me
to
offer
any
recommendation
.
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
has
such
a
knowledge
of
detail
and
such
a
capacity
for
the
*NL*
administration
of
detail
that
she
knows
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
back
into
the
hall
and
explained
to
Jo
what
we
proposed
to
*NL*
do
,
which
Charley
explained
to
him
again
and
which
he
received
with
*NL*
the
languid
unconcern
I
had
already
noticed
,
wearily
looking
on
at
*NL*
what
was
done
as
if
it
were
for
somebody
else
.
The
servants
*NL*
compassionating
his
miserable
state
and
being
very
anxious
to
help
,
*NL*
we
soon
got
the
loft-room
ready
;
and
some
of
the
men
about
the
house
*NL*
carried
him
across
the
wet
yard
,
well
wrapped
up
.
It
was
pleasant
to
*NL*
observe
how
kind
they
were
to
him
and
how
there
appeared
to
be
a
*NL*
general
impression
among
them
that
frequently
calling
him
``
Old
Chap
''
*NL*
was
likely
to
revive
his
spirits
.
Charley
directed
the
operations
and
*NL*
went
to
and
fro
between
the
loft-room
and
the
house
with
such
little
*NL*
stimulants
and
comforts
as
we
thought
it
safe
to
give
him
.
My
*NL*
guardian
himself
saw
him
before
he
was
left
for
the
night
and
*NL*
reported
to
me
when
he
returned
to
the
growlery
to
write
a
letter
on
*NL*
the
boy
's
behalf
,
which
a
messenger
was
charged
to
deliver
at
*NL*
day-light
in
the
morning
,
that
he
seemed
easier
and
inclined
to
*NL*
sleep
.
They
had
fastened
his
door
on
the
outside
,
he
said
,
in
case
of
*NL*
his
being
delirious
,
but
had
so
arranged
that
he
could
not
make
any
*NL*
noise
without
being
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
being
in
our
room
with
a
cold
,
Mr.
Skimpole
was
left
alone
all
*NL*
this
time
and
entertained
himself
by
playing
snatches
of
pathetic
*NL*
airs
and
sometimes
singing
to
them
-LRB-
as
we
heard
at
a
distance
-RRB-
with
*NL*
great
expression
and
feeling
.
When
we
rejoined
him
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
he
said
he
would
give
us
a
little
ballad
which
had
come
*NL*
into
his
head
``
apropos
of
our
young
friend
,
''
and
he
sang
one
about
a
*NL*
peasant
boy
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thrown
on
the
wide
world
,
doomed
to
wander
and
roam
,
*NL*
Bereft
of
his
parents
,
bereft
of
a
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
quite
exquisitely
.
It
was
a
song
that
always
made
him
cry
,
he
told
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
extremely
gay
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
for
he
absolutely
*NL*
chirped
--
those
were
his
delighted
words
--
when
he
thought
by
what
a
*NL*
happy
talent
for
business
he
was
surrounded
.
He
gave
us
,
in
his
glass
*NL*
of
negus
,
``
Better
health
to
our
young
friend
!
''
and
supposed
and
gaily
*NL*
pursued
the
case
of
his
being
reserved
like
Whittington
to
become
*NL*
Lord
Mayor
of
London
.
In
that
event
,
no
doubt
,
he
would
establish
the
*NL*
Jarndyce
Institution
and
the
Summerson
Almshouses
,
and
a
little
*NL*
annual
Corporation
Pilgrimage
to
St.
Albans
.
He
had
no
doubt
,
he
*NL*
said
,
that
our
young
friend
was
an
excellent
boy
in
his
way
,
but
his
*NL*
way
was
not
the
Harold
Skimpole
way
;
what
Harold
Skimpole
was
,
Harold
*NL*
Skimpole
had
found
himself
,
to
his
considerable
surprise
,
when
he
*NL*
first
made
his
own
acquaintance
;
he
had
accepted
himself
with
all
his
*NL*
failings
and
had
thought
it
sound
philosophy
to
make
the
best
of
the
*NL*
bargain
;
and
he
hoped
we
would
do
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
's
last
report
was
that
the
boy
was
quiet
.
I
could
see
,
from
*NL*
my
window
,
the
lantern
they
had
left
him
burning
quietly
;
and
I
went
*NL*
to
bed
very
happy
to
think
that
he
was
sheltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
movement
and
more
talking
than
usual
a
little
before
*NL*
daybreak
,
and
it
awoke
me
.
As
I
was
dressing
,
I
looked
out
of
my
*NL*
window
and
asked
one
of
our
men
who
had
been
among
the
active
*NL*
sympathizers
last
night
whether
there
was
anything
wrong
about
the
*NL*
house
.
The
lantern
was
still
burning
in
the
loft-window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
boy
,
miss
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
worse
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
,
miss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
miss
?
No
.
Gone
clean
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
what
time
of
the
night
he
had
gone
,
or
how
,
or
why
,
it
seemed
*NL*
hopeless
ever
to
divine
.
The
door
remaining
as
it
had
been
left
,
and
*NL*
the
lantern
standing
in
the
window
,
it
could
only
be
supposed
that
he
*NL*
had
got
out
by
a
trap
in
the
floor
which
communicated
with
an
empty
*NL*
cart-house
below
.
But
he
had
shut
it
down
again
,
if
that
were
so
;
and
*NL*
it
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
raised
.
Nothing
of
any
kind
was
*NL*
missing
.
On
this
fact
being
clearly
ascertained
,
we
all
yielded
to
*NL*
the
painful
belief
that
delirium
had
come
upon
him
in
the
night
and
*NL*
that
,
allured
by
some
imaginary
object
or
pursued
by
some
imaginary
*NL*
horror
,
he
had
strayed
away
in
that
worse
than
helpless
state
;
all
of
*NL*
us
,
that
is
to
say
,
but
Mr.
Skimpole
,
who
repeatedly
suggested
,
in
*NL*
his
usual
easy
light
style
,
that
it
had
occurred
to
our
young
friend
*NL*
that
he
was
not
a
safe
inmate
,
having
a
bad
kind
of
fever
upon
him
,
*NL*
and
that
he
had
with
great
natural
politeness
taken
himself
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
possible
inquiry
was
made
,
and
every
place
was
searched
.
The
*NL*
brick-kilns
were
examined
,
the
cottages
were
visited
,
the
two
women
*NL*
were
particularly
questioned
,
but
they
knew
nothing
of
him
,
and
*NL*
nobody
could
doubt
that
their
wonder
was
genuine
.
The
weather
had
for
*NL*
some
time
been
too
wet
and
the
night
itself
had
been
too
wet
to
admit
*NL*
of
any
tracing
by
footsteps
.
Hedge
and
ditch
,
and
wall
,
and
rick
and
*NL*
stack
,
were
examined
by
our
men
for
a
long
distance
round
,
lest
the
*NL*
boy
should
be
lying
in
such
a
place
insensible
or
dead
;
but
nothing
*NL*
was
seen
to
indicate
that
he
had
ever
been
near
.
From
the
time
when
*NL*
he
was
left
in
the
loft-room
,
he
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
continued
for
five
days
.
I
do
not
mean
that
it
ceased
even
*NL*
then
,
but
that
my
attention
was
then
diverted
into
a
current
very
*NL*
memorable
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Charley
was
at
her
writing
again
in
my
room
in
the
evening
,
and
as
*NL*
I
sat
opposite
to
her
at
work
,
I
felt
the
table
tremble
.
Looking
up
,
*NL*
I
saw
my
little
maid
shivering
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
``
are
you
so
cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
am
,
miss
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
hold
myself
still
.
I
felt
so
yesterday
at
about
this
same
time
,
miss
.
*NL*
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
I
think
I
'm
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
Ada
's
voice
outside
,
and
I
hurried
to
the
door
of
*NL*
communication
between
my
room
and
our
pretty
sitting-room
,
and
locked
*NL*
it
.
Just
in
time
,
for
she
tapped
at
it
while
my
hand
was
yet
upon
the
*NL*
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
called
to
me
to
let
her
in
,
but
I
said
,
``
Not
now
,
my
dearest
.
Go
*NL*
away
.
There
's
nothing
the
matter
;
I
will
come
to
you
presently
.
''
Ah
!
*NL*
It
was
a
long
,
long
time
before
my
darling
girl
and
I
were
companions
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
fell
ill
.
In
twelve
hours
she
was
very
ill
.
I
moved
her
to
my
*NL*
room
,
and
laid
her
in
my
bed
,
and
sat
down
quietly
to
nurse
her
.
I
*NL*
told
my
guardian
all
about
it
,
and
why
I
felt
it
was
necessary
that
I
*NL*
should
seclude
myself
,
and
my
reason
for
not
seeing
my
darling
above
*NL*
all
.
At
first
she
came
very
often
to
the
door
,
and
called
to
me
,
and
*NL*
even
reproached
me
with
sobs
and
tears
;
but
I
wrote
her
a
long
letter
*NL*
saying
that
she
made
me
anxious
and
unhappy
and
imploring
her
,
as
she
*NL*
loved
me
and
wished
my
mind
to
be
at
peace
,
to
come
no
nearer
than
*NL*
the
garden
.
After
that
she
came
beneath
the
window
even
oftener
than
*NL*
she
had
come
to
the
door
,
and
if
I
had
learnt
to
love
her
dear
sweet
*NL*
voice
before
when
we
were
hardly
ever
apart
,
how
did
I
learn
to
love
*NL*
it
then
,
when
I
stood
behind
the
window-curtain
listening
and
*NL*
replying
,
but
not
so
much
as
looking
out
!
How
did
I
learn
to
love
it
*NL*
afterwards
,
when
the
harder
time
came
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
put
a
bed
for
me
in
our
sitting-room
;
and
by
keeping
the
door
*NL*
wide
open
,
I
turned
the
two
rooms
into
one
,
now
that
Ada
had
vacated
*NL*
that
part
of
the
house
,
and
kept
them
always
fresh
and
airy
.
There
*NL*
was
not
a
servant
in
or
about
the
house
but
was
so
good
that
they
*NL*
would
all
most
gladly
have
come
to
me
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
*NL*
without
the
least
fear
or
unwillingness
,
but
I
thought
it
best
to
*NL*
choose
one
worthy
woman
who
was
never
to
see
Ada
and
whom
I
could
*NL*
trust
to
come
and
go
with
all
precaution
.
Through
her
means
I
got
out
*NL*
to
take
the
air
with
my
guardian
when
there
was
no
fear
of
meeting
*NL*
Ada
,
and
wanted
for
nothing
in
the
way
of
attendance
,
any
more
than
*NL*
in
any
other
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
poor
Charley
sickened
and
grew
worse
,
and
fell
into
heavy
*NL*
danger
of
death
,
and
lay
severely
ill
for
many
a
long
round
of
day
*NL*
and
night
.
So
patient
she
was
,
so
uncomplaining
,
and
inspired
by
such
*NL*
a
gentle
fortitude
that
very
often
as
I
sat
by
Charley
holding
her
*NL*
head
in
my
arms
--
repose
would
come
to
her
,
so
,
when
it
would
come
to
*NL*
her
in
no
other
attitude
--
I
silently
prayed
to
our
Father
in
heaven
*NL*
that
I
might
not
forget
the
lesson
which
this
little
sister
taught
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
sorrowful
to
think
that
Charley
's
pretty
looks
would
*NL*
change
and
be
disfigured
,
even
if
she
recovered
--
she
was
such
a
child
*NL*
with
her
dimpled
face
--
but
that
thought
was
,
for
the
greater
part
,
*NL*
lost
in
her
greater
peril
.
When
she
was
at
the
worst
,
and
her
mind
*NL*
rambled
again
to
the
cares
of
her
father
's
sick
bed
and
the
little
*NL*
children
,
she
still
knew
me
so
far
as
that
she
would
be
quiet
in
my
*NL*
arms
when
she
could
lie
quiet
nowhere
else
,
and
murmur
out
the
*NL*
wanderings
of
her
mind
less
restlessly
.
At
those
times
I
used
to
*NL*
think
,
how
should
I
ever
tell
the
two
remaining
babies
that
the
baby
*NL*
who
had
learned
of
her
faithful
heart
to
be
a
mother
to
them
in
their
*NL*
need
was
dead
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
other
times
when
Charley
knew
me
well
and
talked
to
me
,
*NL*
telling
me
that
she
sent
her
love
to
Tom
and
Emma
and
that
she
was
*NL*
sure
Tom
would
grow
up
to
be
a
good
man
.
At
those
times
Charley
would
*NL*
speak
to
me
of
what
she
had
read
to
her
father
as
well
as
she
could
*NL*
to
comfort
him
,
of
that
young
man
carried
out
to
be
buried
who
was
*NL*
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
was
a
widow
,
of
the
ruler
's
*NL*
daughter
raised
up
by
the
gracious
hand
upon
her
bed
of
death
.
And
*NL*
Charley
told
me
that
when
her
father
died
she
had
kneeled
down
and
*NL*
prayed
in
her
first
sorrow
that
he
likewise
might
be
raised
up
and
*NL*
given
back
to
his
poor
children
,
and
that
if
she
should
never
get
*NL*
better
and
should
die
too
,
she
thought
it
likely
that
it
might
come
*NL*
into
Tom
's
mind
to
offer
the
same
prayer
for
her
.
Then
would
I
show
*NL*
Tom
how
these
people
of
old
days
had
been
brought
back
to
life
on
*NL*
earth
,
only
that
we
might
know
our
hope
to
be
restored
to
heaven
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
all
the
various
times
there
were
in
Charley
's
illness
,
there
*NL*
was
not
one
when
she
lost
the
gentle
qualities
I
have
spoken
of
.
And
*NL*
there
were
many
,
many
when
I
thought
in
the
night
of
the
last
high
*NL*
belief
in
the
watching
angel
,
and
the
last
higher
trust
in
God
,
on
*NL*
the
part
of
her
poor
despised
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Charley
did
not
die
.
She
flutteringly
and
slowly
turned
the
*NL*
dangerous
point
,
after
long
lingering
there
,
and
then
began
to
mend
.
*NL*
The
hope
that
never
had
been
given
,
from
the
first
,
of
Charley
being
*NL*
in
outward
appearance
Charley
any
more
soon
began
to
be
encouraged
;
*NL*
and
even
that
prospered
,
and
I
saw
her
growing
into
her
old
childish
*NL*
likeness
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
morning
when
I
could
tell
Ada
all
this
as
she
stood
*NL*
out
in
the
garden
;
and
it
was
a
great
evening
when
Charley
and
I
at
*NL*
last
took
tea
together
in
the
next
room
.
But
on
that
same
evening
,
I
*NL*
felt
that
I
was
stricken
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
both
of
us
,
it
was
not
until
Charley
was
safe
in
bed
*NL*
again
and
placidly
asleep
that
I
began
to
think
the
contagion
of
her
*NL*
illness
was
upon
me
.
I
had
been
able
easily
to
hide
what
I
felt
at
*NL*
tea-time
,
but
I
was
past
that
already
now
,
and
I
knew
that
I
was
*NL*
rapidly
following
in
Charley
's
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
well
enough
,
however
,
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
to
*NL*
return
my
darling
's
cheerful
blessing
from
the
garden
,
and
to
talk
*NL*
with
her
as
long
as
usual
.
But
I
was
not
free
from
an
impression
that
*NL*
I
had
been
walking
about
the
two
rooms
in
the
night
,
a
little
beside
*NL*
myself
,
though
knowing
where
I
was
;
and
I
felt
confused
at
*NL*
times
--
with
a
curious
sense
of
fullness
,
as
if
I
were
becoming
too
*NL*
large
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
I
was
so
much
worse
that
I
resolved
to
prepare
*NL*
Charley
,
with
which
view
I
said
,
``
You
're
getting
quite
strong
,
*NL*
Charley
,
are
you
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quite
!
''
said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strong
enough
to
be
told
a
secret
,
I
think
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
strong
enough
for
that
,
miss
!
''
cried
Charley
.
But
Charley
's
*NL*
face
fell
in
the
height
of
her
delight
,
for
she
saw
the
secret
in
MY
*NL*
face
;
and
she
came
out
of
the
great
chair
,
and
fell
upon
my
bosom
,
*NL*
and
said
``
Oh
,
miss
,
it
's
my
doing
!
It
's
my
doing
!
''
and
a
great
deal
*NL*
more
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
grateful
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Charley
,
''
said
I
after
letting
her
go
on
for
a
little
while
,
*NL*
``
if
I
am
to
be
ill
,
my
great
trust
,
humanly
speaking
,
is
in
you
.
And
*NL*
unless
you
are
as
quiet
and
composed
for
me
as
you
always
were
for
*NL*
yourself
,
you
can
never
fulfil
it
,
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
,
miss
,
''
said
Charley
.
``
Oh
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
my
dear
!
If
you
'll
only
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
.
Oh
,
my
*NL*
dear
!
''
--
how
affectionately
and
devotedly
she
poured
this
out
as
she
*NL*
clung
to
my
neck
,
I
never
can
remember
without
tears
--
``
I
'll
be
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
let
Charley
cry
a
little
longer
,
and
it
did
us
both
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
in
me
now
,
if
you
please
,
miss
,
''
said
Charley
quietly
.
``
I
am
*NL*
listening
to
everything
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
little
at
present
,
Charley
.
I
shall
tell
your
doctor
*NL*
to-night
that
I
do
n't
think
I
am
well
and
that
you
are
going
to
nurse
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
that
the
poor
child
thanked
me
with
her
whole
heart
.
``
And
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
when
you
hear
Miss
Ada
in
the
garden
,
if
I
should
not
be
*NL*
quite
able
to
go
to
the
window-curtain
as
usual
,
do
you
go
,
Charley
,
*NL*
and
say
I
am
asleep
--
that
I
have
rather
tired
myself
,
and
am
asleep
.
*NL*
At
all
times
keep
the
room
as
I
have
kept
it
,
Charley
,
and
let
no
one
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
promised
,
and
I
lay
down
,
for
I
was
very
heavy
.
I
saw
the
*NL*
doctor
that
night
and
asked
the
favour
of
him
that
I
wished
to
ask
*NL*
relative
to
his
saying
nothing
of
my
illness
in
the
house
as
yet
.
I
*NL*
have
a
very
indistinct
remembrance
of
that
night
melting
into
day
,
*NL*
and
of
day
melting
into
night
again
;
but
I
was
just
able
on
the
first
*NL*
morning
to
get
to
the
window
and
speak
to
my
darling
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
morning
I
heard
her
dear
voice
--
Oh
,
how
dear
*NL*
now
!
--
outside
;
and
I
asked
Charley
,
with
some
difficulty
-LRB-
speech
*NL*
being
painful
to
me
-RRB-
,
to
go
and
say
I
was
asleep
.
I
heard
her
answer
*NL*
softly
,
``
Do
n't
disturb
her
,
Charley
,
for
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
my
own
Pride
look
,
Charley
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disappointed
,
miss
,
''
said
Charley
,
peeping
through
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
she
is
very
beautiful
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
indeed
,
miss
,
''
answered
Charley
,
peeping
.
``
Still
looking
up
*NL*
at
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
blue
clear
eyes
,
God
bless
them
,
always
loveliest
when
*NL*
raised
like
that
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
called
Charley
to
me
and
gave
her
her
last
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Charley
,
when
she
knows
I
am
ill
,
she
will
try
to
make
her
way
*NL*
into
the
room
.
Keep
her
out
,
Charley
,
if
you
love
me
truly
,
to
the
*NL*
last
!
Charley
,
if
you
let
her
in
but
once
,
only
to
look
upon
me
for
*NL*
one
moment
as
I
lie
here
,
I
shall

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Appointed
Time
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
night
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
--
perplexed
and
troublous
valley
of
the
*NL*
shadow
of
the
law
,
where
suitors
generally
find
but
little
day
--
and
*NL*
fat
candles
are
snuffed
out
in
offices
,
and
clerks
have
rattled
down
*NL*
the
crazy
wooden
stairs
and
dispersed
.
The
bell
that
rings
at
nine
*NL*
o'clock
has
ceased
its
doleful
clangour
about
nothing
;
the
gates
are
*NL*
shut
;
and
the
night-porter
,
a
solemn
warder
with
a
mighty
power
of
*NL*
sleep
,
keeps
guard
in
his
lodge
.
From
tiers
of
staircase
windows
*NL*
clogged
lamps
like
the
eyes
of
Equity
,
bleared
Argus
with
a
*NL*
fathomless
pocket
for
every
eye
and
an
eye
upon
it
,
dimly
blink
at
*NL*
the
stars
.
In
dirty
upper
casements
,
here
and
there
,
hazy
little
*NL*
patches
of
candlelight
reveal
where
some
wise
draughtsman
and
*NL*
conveyancer
yet
toils
for
the
entanglement
of
real
estate
in
meshes
*NL*
of
sheep-skin
,
in
the
average
ratio
of
about
a
dozen
of
sheep
to
an
*NL*
acre
of
land
.
Over
which
bee-like
industry
these
benefactors
of
their
*NL*
species
linger
yet
,
though
office-hours
be
past
,
that
they
may
give
,
*NL*
for
every
day
,
some
good
account
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
neighbouring
court
,
where
the
Lord
Chancellor
of
the
rag
and
*NL*
bottle
shop
dwells
,
there
is
a
general
tendency
towards
beer
and
*NL*
supper
.
Mrs.
Piper
and
Mrs.
Perkins
,
whose
respective
sons
,
engaged
*NL*
with
a
circle
of
acquaintance
in
the
game
of
hide
and
seek
,
have
been
*NL*
lying
in
ambush
about
the
by-ways
of
Chancery
Lane
for
some
hours
and
*NL*
scouring
the
plain
of
the
same
thoroughfare
to
the
confusion
of
*NL*
passengers
--
Mrs.
Piper
and
Mrs.
Perkins
have
but
now
exchanged
*NL*
congratulations
on
the
children
being
abed
,
and
they
still
linger
on
*NL*
a
door-step
over
a
few
parting
words
.
Mr.
Krook
and
his
lodger
,
and
*NL*
the
fact
of
Mr.
Krook
's
being
``
continually
in
liquor
,
''
and
the
*NL*
testamentary
prospects
of
the
young
man
are
,
as
usual
,
the
staple
of
*NL*
their
conversation
.
But
they
have
something
to
say
,
likewise
,
of
the
*NL*
Harmonic
Meeting
at
the
Sol
's
Arms
,
where
the
sound
of
the
piano
*NL*
through
the
partly
opened
windows
jingles
out
into
the
court
,
and
*NL*
where
Little
Swills
,
after
keeping
the
lovers
of
harmony
in
a
roar
*NL*
like
a
very
Yorick
,
may
now
be
heard
taking
the
gruff
line
in
a
*NL*
concerted
piece
and
sentimentally
adjuring
his
friends
and
patrons
to
*NL*
``
Listen
,
listen
,
listen
,
tew
the
wa-ter
fall
!
''
Mrs.
Perkins
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Piper
compare
opinions
on
the
subject
of
the
young
lady
of
*NL*
professional
celebrity
who
assists
at
the
Harmonic
Meetings
and
who
*NL*
has
a
space
to
herself
in
the
manuscript
announcement
in
the
window
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Perkins
possessing
information
that
she
has
been
married
a
year
*NL*
and
a
half
,
though
announced
as
Miss
M.
Melvilleson
,
the
noted
siren
,
*NL*
and
that
her
baby
is
clandestinely
conveyed
to
the
Sol
's
Arms
every
*NL*
night
to
receive
its
natural
nourishment
during
the
entertainments
.
*NL*
``
Sooner
than
which
,
myself
,
''
says
Mrs.
Perkins
,
``
I
would
get
my
*NL*
living
by
selling
lucifers
.
''
Mrs.
Piper
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
is
of
the
*NL*
same
opinion
,
holding
that
a
private
station
is
better
than
public
*NL*
applause
,
and
thanking
heaven
for
her
own
-LRB-
and
,
by
implication
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Perkins
'
-RRB-
respectability
.
By
this
time
the
pot-boy
of
the
Sol
's
Arms
*NL*
appearing
with
her
supper-pint
well
frothed
,
Mrs.
Piper
accepts
that
*NL*
tankard
and
retires
indoors
,
first
giving
a
fair
good
night
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Perkins
,
who
has
had
her
own
pint
in
her
hand
ever
since
it
was
*NL*
fetched
from
the
same
hostelry
by
young
Perkins
before
he
was
sent
to
*NL*
bed
.
Now
there
is
a
sound
of
putting
up
shop-shutters
in
the
court
*NL*
and
a
smell
as
of
the
smoking
of
pipes
;
and
shooting
stars
are
seen
*NL*
in
upper
windows
,
further
indicating
retirement
to
rest
.
Now
,
too
,
*NL*
the
policeman
begins
to
push
at
doors
;
to
try
fastenings
;
to
be
*NL*
suspicious
of
bundles
;
and
to
administer
his
beat
,
on
the
hypothesis
*NL*
that
every
one
is
either
robbing
or
being
robbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
close
night
,
though
the
damp
cold
is
searching
too
,
and
there
*NL*
is
a
laggard
mist
a
little
way
up
in
the
air
.
It
is
a
fine
steaming
*NL*
night
to
turn
the
slaughter-houses
,
the
unwholesome
trades
,
the
*NL*
sewerage
,
bad
water
,
and
burial-grounds
to
account
,
and
give
the
*NL*
registrar
of
deaths
some
extra
business
.
It
may
be
something
in
the
*NL*
air
--
there
is
plenty
in
it
--
or
it
may
be
something
in
himself
that
is
*NL*
in
fault
;
but
Mr.
Weevle
,
otherwise
Jobling
,
is
very
ill
at
ease
.
He
*NL*
comes
and
goes
between
his
own
room
and
the
open
street
door
twenty
*NL*
times
an
hour
.
He
has
been
doing
so
ever
since
it
fell
dark
.
Since
*NL*
the
Chancellor
shut
up
his
shop
,
which
he
did
very
early
to-night
,
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
has
been
down
and
up
,
and
down
and
up
-LRB-
with
a
cheap
tight
*NL*
velvet
skull-cap
on
his
head
,
making
his
whiskers
look
out
of
all
*NL*
proportion
-RRB-
,
oftener
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
phenomenon
that
Mr.
Snagsby
should
be
ill
at
ease
too
,
for
*NL*
he
always
is
so
,
more
or
less
,
under
the
oppressive
influence
of
the
*NL*
secret
that
is
upon
him
.
Impelled
by
the
mystery
of
which
he
is
a
*NL*
partaker
and
yet
in
which
he
is
not
a
sharer
,
Mr.
Snagsby
haunts
what
*NL*
seems
to
be
its
fountain-head
--
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
in
the
court
.
*NL*
It
has
an
irresistible
attraction
for
him
.
Even
now
,
coming
round
by
*NL*
the
Sol
's
Arms
with
the
intention
of
passing
down
the
court
,
and
out
*NL*
at
the
Chancery
Lane
end
,
and
so
terminating
his
unpremeditated
*NL*
after-supper
stroll
of
ten
minutes
'
long
from
his
own
door
and
back
*NL*
again
,
Mr.
Snagsby
approaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Mr.
Weevle
?
''
says
the
stationer
,
stopping
to
speak
.
``
Are
YOU
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
''
says
Weevle
,
``
Here
I
am
,
Mr.
Snagsby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Airing
yourself
,
as
I
am
doing
,
before
you
go
to
bed
?
''
the
stationer
*NL*
inquires
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
not
much
air
to
be
got
here
;
and
what
there
is
,
is
not
*NL*
very
freshening
,
''
Weevle
answers
,
glancing
up
and
down
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
sir
.
Do
n't
you
observe
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
pausing
to
*NL*
sniff
and
taste
the
air
a
little
,
``
do
n't
you
observe
,
Mr.
Weevle
,
*NL*
that
you
're
--
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
--
that
you
're
rather
*NL*
greasy
here
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
have
noticed
myself
that
there
is
a
queer
kind
of
flavour
in
*NL*
the
place
to-night
,
''
Mr.
Weevle
rejoins
.
``
I
suppose
it
's
chops
at
the
*NL*
Sol
's
Arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chops
,
do
you
think
?
Oh
!
Chops
,
eh
?
''
Mr.
Snagsby
sniffs
and
tastes
*NL*
again
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
suppose
it
is
.
But
I
should
say
their
cook
at
*NL*
the
Sol
wanted
a
little
looking
after
.
She
has
been
burning
'em
,
sir
!
*NL*
And
I
do
n't
think
''
--
Mr.
Snagsby
sniffs
and
tastes
again
and
then
*NL*
spits
and
wipes
his
mouth
--
``
I
do
n't
think
--
not
to
put
too
fine
a
*NL*
point
upon
it
--
that
they
were
quite
fresh
when
they
were
shown
the
*NL*
gridiron
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
likely
.
It
's
a
tainting
sort
of
weather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
IS
a
tainting
sort
of
weather
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
``
and
I
find
it
*NL*
sinking
to
the
spirits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
George
!
I
find
it
gives
me
the
horrors
,
''
returns
Mr.
Weevle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
you
see
,
you
live
in
a
lonesome
way
,
and
in
a
lonesome
room
,
*NL*
with
a
black
circumstance
hanging
over
it
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
looking
*NL*
in
past
the
other
's
shoulder
along
the
dark
passage
and
then
falling
*NL*
back
a
step
to
look
up
at
the
house
.
``
I
could
n't
live
in
that
room
*NL*
alone
,
as
you
do
,
sir
.
I
should
get
so
fidgety
and
worried
of
an
*NL*
evening
,
sometimes
,
that
I
should
be
driven
to
come
to
the
door
and
*NL*
stand
here
sooner
than
sit
there
.
But
then
it
's
very
true
that
you
*NL*
did
n't
see
,
in
your
room
,
what
I
saw
there
.
That
makes
a
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
quite
enough
about
it
,
''
returns
Tony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
agreeable
,
is
it
?
''
pursues
Mr.
Snagsby
,
coughing
his
cough
*NL*
of
mild
persuasion
behind
his
hand
.
``
Mr.
Krook
ought
to
consider
it
*NL*
in
the
rent

I
hope
he
does
,
I
am
sure

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
does

says
Tony
.
``
But
I
doubt
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
the
rent
too
high
,
do
you
,
sir
?
''
returns
the
stationer
.
*NL*
``
Rents
ARE
high
about
here
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
exactly
,
but
the
*NL*
law
seems
to
put
things
up
in
price
.
Not
,
''
adds
Mr.
Snagsby
with
his
*NL*
apologetic
cough
,
``
that
I
mean
to
say
a
word
against
the
profession
I
*NL*
get
my
living
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
again
glances
up
and
down
the
court
and
then
looks
at
the
*NL*
stationer
.
Mr.
Snagsby
,
blankly
catching
his
eye
,
looks
upward
for
a
*NL*
star
or
so
and
coughs
a
cough
expressive
of
not
exactly
seeing
his
*NL*
way
out
of
this
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
curious
fact
,
sir
,
''
he
observes
,
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
,
*NL*
``
that
he
should
have
been
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
he
?
''
interrupts
Mr.
Weevle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deceased
,
you
know
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
twitching
his
head
and
*NL*
right
eyebrow
towards
the
staircase
and
tapping
his
acquaintance
on
*NL*
the
button
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
''
returns
the
other
as
if
he
were
not
over-fond
of
*NL*
the
subject
.
``
I
thought
we
had
done
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
only
going
to
say
it
's
a
curious
fact

sir

that
he
should
*NL*
have
come
and
lived
here
,
and
been
one
of
my
writers
,
and
then
that
*NL*
you
should
come
and
live
here
,
and
be
one
of
my
writers
too
.
Which
*NL*
there
is
nothing
derogatory
,
but
far
from
it
in
the
appellation
,
''
*NL*
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
breaking
off
with
a
mistrust
that
he
may
have
*NL*
unpolitely
asserted
a
kind
of
proprietorship
in
Mr.
Weevle
,
``
because
*NL*
I
have
known
writers
that
have
gone
into
brewers
'
houses
and
done
*NL*
really
very
respectable
indeed
.
Eminently
respectable
,
sir
,
''
adds
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
with
a
misgiving
that
he
has
not
improved
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
curious
coincidence
,
as
you
say
,
''
answers
Weevle
,
once
more
*NL*
glancing
up
and
down
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seems
a
fate
in
it
,
do
n't
there
?
''
suggests
the
stationer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
observes
the
stationer
with
his
confirmatory
cough
.
``
Quite
*NL*
a
fate
in
it
.
Quite
a
fate
.
Well
,
Mr.
Weevle
,
I
am
afraid
I
must
bid
*NL*
you
good
night
''
--
Mr.
Snagsby
speaks
as
if
it
made
him
desolate
to
go
,
*NL*
though
he
has
been
casting
about
for
any
means
of
escape
ever
since
*NL*
he
stopped
to
speak
--
``
my
little
woman
will
be
looking
for
me
else
.
*NL*
Good
night
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mr.
Snagsby
hastens
home
to
save
his
little
woman
the
trouble
of
*NL*
looking
for
him
,
he
might
set
his
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
.
His
*NL*
little
woman
has
had
her
eye
upon
him
round
the
Sol
's
Arms
all
this
*NL*
time
and
now
glides
after
him
with
a
pocket
handkerchief
wrapped
over
*NL*
her
head
,
honouring
Mr.
Weevle
and
his
doorway
with
a
searching
*NL*
glance
as
she
goes
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
know
me
again
,
ma'am
,
at
all
events
,
''
says
Mr.
Weevle
to
*NL*
himself
;
``
and
I
ca
n't
compliment
you
on
your
appearance
,
whoever
you
*NL*
are

with
your
head
tied
up
in
a
bundle
.
Is
this
fellow
NEVER
*NL*
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
fellow
approaches
as
he
speaks
.
Mr.
Weevle
softly
holds
up
his
*NL*
finger
,
and
draws
him
into
the
passage
,
and
closes
the
street
door
.
*NL*
Then
they
go
upstairs
,
Mr.
Weevle
heavily
,
and
Mr.
Guppy
-LRB-
for
it
is
*NL*
he
-RRB-
very
lightly
indeed
.
When
they
are
shut
into
the
back
room
,
they
*NL*
speak
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
had
gone
to
Jericho
at
least
instead
of
coming
here
,
''
*NL*
says
Tony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
said
about
ten

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
about

Tony
repeats
.
``
Yes
,
so
you
did
say
about
ten

*NL*
But
according
to
my
count
,
it
's
ten
times
ten
--
it
's
a
hundred
*NL*
o'clock
.
I
never
had
such
a
night
in
my
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
been
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
says
Tony
.
``
Nothing
has
been
the
matter

But
here
have
I
*NL*
been
stewing
and
fuming
in
this
jolly
old
crib
till
I
have
had
the
*NL*
horrors
falling
on
me
as
thick
as
hail

THERE
'S
a
blessed-looking
*NL*
candle
!

says
Tony
,
pointing
to
the
heavily
burning
taper
on
his
*NL*
table
with
a
great
cabbage
head
and
a
long
winding-sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
easily
improved

Mr.
Guppy
observes
as
he
takes
the
snuffers
*NL*
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
IS
it
?
''
returns
his
friend
.
``
Not
so
easily
as
you
think

It
has
been
*NL*
smouldering
like
that
ever
since
it
was
lighted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
you

inquires
Mr.
Guppy
,
looking
*NL*
at
him
,
snuffers
in
hand
,
as
he
sits
down
with
his
elbow
on
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
Guppy

''
replies
the
other
,
``
I
am
in
the
downs

It
's
this
*NL*
unbearably
dull

downstairs

Mr.
Weevle
moodily
pushes
the
snuffers-tray
from
him
with
*NL*
his
elbow
,
leans
his
head
on
his
hand
,
puts
his
feet
on
the
fender
,
*NL*
and
looks
at
the
fire

Mr.
Guppy
,
observing
him
,
slightly
tosses
his
*NL*
head
and
sits
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
in
an
easy
*NL*
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
--
yes

said
Mr.
Weevle
,
altering
the
*NL*
construction
of
his
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
business

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

No

He
was
only
sauntering
by

stopped
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
Snagsby

says
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
and
thought
it
as
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
we
go

cried
Tony
,
looking
up
for
an

instant

So
mysterious

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
affects
to
smile
,
and
with
the
view
of
changing
the
*NL*
conversation
,
looks
with
an
admiration
,
real
or
pretended
,
round
the
*NL*
room
at
the
Galaxy
Gallery
of
British
Beauty
,
terminating
his
survey
*NL*
with
the
portrait
of
Lady
Dedlock
over
the
mantelshelf
,
in
which
she
*NL*
is
represented
on
a
terrace
,
with
a
pedestal
upon
the
terrace
,
and
a
*NL*
vase
upon
the
pedestal
,
and
her
shawl
upon
the
vase
,
and
a
prodigious
*NL*
piece
of
fur
upon
the
shawl

and
her
arm
on
the
prodigious
piece
of
*NL*
fur
,
and
a

on

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
like

says
Mr.

``
It
's
a
speaking

*NL*
*NL*
``

Tony
,
without
changing
his
position
.
``
I
*NL*
should
have
some
fashionable
conversation

here

*NL*
*NL*
Finding
by
this
time
that
his
friend
is
not
to
be
wheedled
into
a
*NL*
more
sociable
humour
,
Mr.
Guppy
puts
about
upon
the
ill-used
tack
and
*NL*
remonstrates
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tony

says
he
,
``
I
can
make
allowances

lowness

what
it
is

come
upon
a
man
better
than
I

no

perhaps
has
a
better
right

has
an
unrequited
image
imprinted

But
there
are
bounds
*NL*
to
these
things
when
an
unoffending
party
is
in
question

I
will
*NL*
acknowledge
to
you

Tony
,
that
I
do
n't
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
strong

William

returns
Mr.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

it
may
be

Mr.

,
``

I

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
admits
that
he
has
been
wrong
and
begs
Mr.
William
Guppy
*NL*
to
think
no
more
about
it
.
Mr.
William
Guppy
,
however
,
having
got
the
*NL*
advantage
,
can
not
quite
release
it
without
a
little
more
injured
*NL*
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Dash
it

Tony

''
says
that
gentleman
,
``
you
really
ought

image
imprinted
on
his

who
is
NOT
altogether
happy
in
those
*NL*
chords

vibrate
to
the
tenderest

in

yourself
all

charm

hover
around

open

you

Tony
again
entreats

pursued

emphatically

Mr.

acquiesces

the

says
Tony

stirring
the
fire

to-night

helped
him
to
shut
up

and
he
had
got
*NL*
the
letters

in

He
pulled

off

he
happens

goes
listening

upstairs

Comes
back

glancing
with

pursue

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
know
?
''
urges
Mr.
Guppy
,
raising
his
voice
a
little
;
*NL*
but
on
his
friend
's
once
more
warning
him
,
``
I
tell
you
,
you
ca
n't
*NL*
speak
too
low
,
''
he
repeats
his
question
without
any
sound
at
all
,
*NL*
forming
with
his
lips
only
the
words
,
``
What
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
three
things
.
First
,
I
know
that
here
we
are
whispering
in
*NL*
secrecy
,
a
pair
of
conspirators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
And
we
had
better
be
that
than
a
pair
of
*NL*
noodles
,
which
we
should
be
if
we
were
doing
anything
else
,
for
it
's
*NL*
the
only
way
of
doing
what
we
want
to
do
.
Secondly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Secondly
,
it
's
not
made
out
to
me
how
it
's
likely
to
be
profitable
,
*NL*
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
casts
up
his
eyes
at
the
portrait
of
Lady
Dedlock
over
the
*NL*
mantelshelf
and
replies
,
``
Tony
,
you
are
asked
to
leave
that
to
the
*NL*
honour
of
your
friend
.
Besides
its
being
calculated
to
serve
that
*NL*
friend
in
those
chords
of
the
human
mind
which
--
which
need
not
be
*NL*
called
into
agonizing
vibration
on
the
present
occasion
--
your
friend
*NL*
is
no
fool
.
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
eleven
o'clock
striking
by
the
bell
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
Listen
and
*NL*
you
'll
hear
all
the
bells
in
the
city
jangling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
sit
silent
,
listening
to
the
metal
voices
,
near
and
distant
,
*NL*
resounding
from
towers
of
various
heights
,
in
tones
more
various
than
*NL*
their
situations
.
When
these
at
length
cease
,
all
seems
more
*NL*
mysterious
and
quiet
than
before
.
One
disagreeable
result
of
*NL*
whispering
is
that
it
seems
to
evoke
an
atmosphere
of
silence
,
*NL*
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
sound
--
strange
cracks
and
tickings
,
the
*NL*
rustling
of
garments
that
have
no
substance
in
them
,
and
the
tread
of
*NL*
dreadful
feet
that
would
leave
no
mark
on
the
sea-sand
or
the
winter
*NL*
snow
.
So
sensitive
the
two
friends
happen
to
be
that
the
air
is
full
*NL*
of
these
phantoms
,
and
the
two
look
over
their
shoulders
by
one
*NL*
consent
to
see
that
the
door
is
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Tony
?
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
drawing
nearer
to
the
fire
and
biting
*NL*
his
unsteady
thumb-nail
.
``
You
were
going
to
say
,
thirdly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
far
from
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
plotting
about
a
dead
man
in
*NL*
the
room
where
he
died
,
especially
when
you
happen
to
live
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
are
plotting
nothing
against
him
,
Tony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
not
,
still
I
do
n't
like
it
.
Live
here
by
yourself
and
see
how
*NL*
YOU
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
dead
men
,
Tony
,
''
proceeds
Mr.
Guppy
,
evading
this
proposal
,
*NL*
``
there
have
been
dead
men
in
most
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
there
have
,
but
in
most
rooms
you
let
them
alone
,
and
--
and
*NL*
they
let
you
alone
,
''
Tony
answers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
look
at
each
other
again
.
Mr.
Guppy
makes
a
hurried
remark
to
*NL*
the
effect
that
they
may
be
doing
the
deceased
a
service
,
that
he
*NL*
hopes
so
.
There
is
an
oppressive
blank
until
Mr.
Weevle
,
by
stirring
*NL*
the
fire
suddenly
,
makes
Mr.
Guppy
start
as
if
his
heart
had
been
*NL*
stirred
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fah
!
Here
's
more
of
this
hateful
soot
hanging
about
,
''
says
he
.
``
Let
*NL*
us
open
the
window
a
bit
and
get
a
mouthful
of
air
.
It
's
too
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raises
the
sash
,
and
they
both
rest
on
the
window-sill
,
half
in
*NL*
and
half
out
of
the
room
.
The
neighbouring
houses
are
too
near
to
*NL*
admit
of
their
seeing
any
sky
without
craning
their
necks
and
looking
*NL*
up
,
but
lights
in
frowsy
windows
here
and
there
,
and
the
rolling
of
*NL*
distant
carriages
,
and
the
new
expression
that
there
is
of
the
stir
*NL*
of
men
,
they
find
to
be
comfortable
.
Mr.
Guppy
,
noiselessly
tapping
*NL*
on
the
window-sill
,
resumes
his
whispering
in
quite
a
light-comedy
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
by
,
Tony
,
do
n't
forget
old
Smallweed
,
''
meaning
the
younger
of
*NL*
that
name
.
``
I
have
not
let
him
into
this
,
you
know
.
That
grandfather
*NL*
of
his
is
too
keen
by
half
.
It
runs
in
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
''
says
Tony
.
``
I
am
up
to
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
to
Krook
,
''
resumes
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
Now
,
do
you
suppose
he
really
*NL*
has
got
hold
of
any
other
papers
of
importance
,
as
he
has
boasted
to
*NL*
you
,
since
you
have
been
such
allies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tony
shakes
his
head
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Ca
n't
Imagine
.
If
we
get
through
*NL*
this
business
without
rousing
his
suspicions
,
I
shall
be
better
*NL*
informed
,
no
doubt
.
How
can
I
know
without
seeing
them
,
when
he
do
n't
*NL*
know
himself
?
He
is
always
spelling
out
words
from
them
,
and
chalking
*NL*
them
over
the
table
and
the
shop-wall
,
and
asking
what
this
is
and
*NL*
what
that
is
;
but
his
whole
stock
from
beginning
to
end
may
easily
be
*NL*
the
waste-paper
he
bought
it
as
,
for
anything
I
can
say
.
It
's
a
*NL*
monomania
with
him
to
think
he
is
possessed
of
documents
.
He
has
been
*NL*
going
to
learn
to
read
them
this
last
quarter
of
a
century
,
I
should
*NL*
judge
,
from
what
he
tells
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
first
come
by
that
idea
,
though
?
That
's
the
question
,
''
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
suggests
with
one
eye
shut
,
after
a
little
forensic
*NL*
meditation
.
``
He
may
have
found
papers
in
something
he
bought
,
where
*NL*
papers
were
not
supposed
to
be
,
and
may
have
got
it
into
his
shrewd
*NL*
head
from
the
manner
and
place
of
their
concealment
that
they
are
*NL*
worth
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
he
may
have
been
taken
in
,
in
some
pretended
bargain
.
Or
he
may
*NL*
have
been
muddled
altogether
by
long
staring
at
whatever
he
HAS
got
,
*NL*
and
by
drink
,
and
by
hanging
about
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
Court
and
*NL*
hearing
of
documents
for
ever
,
''
returns
Mr.
Weevle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
sitting
on
the
window-sill
,
nodding
his
head
and
balancing
*NL*
all
these
possibilities
in
his
mind
,
continues
thoughtfully
to
tap
*NL*
it
,
and
clasp
it
,
and
measure
it
with
his
hand
,
until
he
hastily
*NL*
draws
his
hand
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
in
the
devil
's
name
,
''
he
says
,
``
is
this
!
Look
at
my
fingers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
thick
,
yellow
liquor
defiles
them
,
which
is
offensive
to
the
touch
*NL*
and
sight
and
more
offensive
to
the
smell
.
A
stagnant
,
sickening
oil
*NL*
with
some
natural
repulsion
in
it
that
makes
them
both
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
doing
here
?
What
have
you
been
pouring
out
of
*NL*
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pouring
out
of
window
!
Nothing

I
swear

Never
,
since
I
have
been
*NL*
here
!
''
cries
the
lodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
look
here
--
and
look
here
!
When
he
brings
the
candle
here
,
*NL*
from
the
corner
of
the
window-sill
,
it
slowly
drips
and
creeps
away
*NL*
down
the
bricks
,
here
lies
in
a
little
thick
nauseous
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
horrible
house
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
,
shutting
down
the
window
.
*NL*
``
Give
me
some
water
or
I
shall
cut
my
hand
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
so
washes
,
and
rubs
,
and
scrubs
,
and
smells
,
and
washes
,
that
he
*NL*
has
not
long
restored
himself
with
a
glass
of
brandy
and
stood
*NL*
silently
before
the
fire
when
Saint
Paul
's
bell
strikes
twelve
and
*NL*
all
those
other
bells
strike
twelve
from
their
towers
of
various
*NL*
heights
in
the
dark
air
,
and
in
their
many
tones
.
When
all
is
quiet
*NL*
again
,
the
lodger
says
,
``
It
's
the
appointed
time
at
last
.
Shall
I
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
nods
and
gives
him
a
``
lucky
touch
''
on
the
back
,
but
not
*NL*
with
the
washed
hand
,
though
it
is
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
goes
downstairs
,
and
Mr.
Guppy
tries
to
compose
himself
before
the
*NL*
fire
for
waiting
a
long
time
.
But
in
no
more
than
a
minute
or
two
the
*NL*
stairs
creak
and
Tony
comes
swiftly
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
them
!
No
.
The
old
man
's
not
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
been
so
horribly
frightened
in
the
short
interval
that
his
*NL*
terror
seizes
the
other
,
who
makes
a
rush
at
him
and
asks
loudly
,
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
make
him
hear
,
and
I
softly
opened
the
door
and
looked
*NL*
in
.
And
the
burning
smell
is
there
--
and
the
soot
is
there
,
and
the
*NL*
oil
is
there
--
and
he
is
not
there
!
''
Tony
ends
this
with
a
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
takes
the
light
.
They
go
down
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
and
*NL*
holding
one
another
,
push
open
the
door
of
the
back
shop
.
The
cat
has
*NL*
retreated
close
to
it
and
stands
snarling
,
not
at
them
,
at
something
*NL*
on
the
ground
before
the
fire
.
There
is
a
very
little
fire
left
in
*NL*
the
grate
,
but
there
is
a
smouldering
,
suffocating
vapour
in
the
room
*NL*
and
a
dark
,
greasy
coating
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
.
The
chairs
and
*NL*
table
,
and
the
bottle
so
rarely
absent
from
the
table
,
all
stand
as
*NL*
usual
.
On
one
chair-back
hang
the
old
man
's
hairy
cap
and
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
whispers
the
lodger
,
pointing
his
friend
's
attention
to
these
*NL*
objects
with
a
trembling
finger
.
``
I
told
you
so
.
When
I
saw
him
last
,
*NL*
he
took
his
cap
off
,
took
out
the
little
bundle
of
old
letters
,
hung
*NL*
his
cap
on
the
back
of
the
chair
--
his
coat
was
there
already
,
for
he
*NL*
had
pulled
that
off
before
he
went
to
put
the
shutters
up
--
and
I
left
*NL*
him
turning
the
letters
over
in
his
hand
,
standing
just
where
that
*NL*
crumbled
black
thing
is
upon
the
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Is
he
hanging
somewhere
?
They
look
up
.
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
whispers
Tony
.
``
At
the
foot
of
the
same
chair
there
lies
a
*NL*
dirty
bit
of
thin
red
cord
that
they
tie
up
pens
with
.
That
went
*NL*
round
the
letters

He
undid
it
slowly
,
leering
and
laughing
at
me
,
*NL*
before
he
began
to
turn
them
over
,
and
threw
it
there
.
I
saw
it
*NL*
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
the
cat
?

says
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
Look
at
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mad
,
I
think

And
no
wonder
in
this
evil
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
advance
slowly
,
looking
at
all
these
things
.
The
cat
remains
*NL*
where
they
found
her
,
still
snarling
at
the
something
on
the
ground
*NL*
before
the
fire
and
between
the
two
chairs
.
What
is
it
?
Hold
up
the
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
is
a
small
burnt
patch
of
flooring
;
here
is
the
tinder
from
a
*NL*
little
bundle
of
burnt
paper
,
but
not
so
light
as
usual
,
seeming
to
*NL*
be
steeped
in
something
;
and
here
is
--
is
it
the
cinder
of
a
small
*NL*
charred
and
broken
log
of
wood
sprinkled
with
white
ashes
,
or
is
it
*NL*
coal
?
Oh
,
horror
,
he
IS
here
!
And
this
from
which
we
run
away
,
*NL*
striking
out
the
light
and
overturning
one
another
into
the
street
,
*NL*
is
all
that
represents
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Help

help

help

Come
into
this
house
for
heaven
's
sake

Plenty
will
*NL*
come
in

none
can
help

breathlessly
*NL*
fetched

's
parlour
,
and
*NL*
write
with
ravenous
little
pens
on
tissue-paper
.
Now
do
they
note
*NL*
down
,
in
the
watches
of
the
night
,
how
the
neighbourhood
of
Chancery
*NL*
Lane
was
yesterday
,
at
about
midnight
,
thrown
into
a
state
of
the
*NL*
most
intense
agitation
and
excitement
by
the
following
alarming
and
*NL*
horrible
discovery
.
Now
do
they
set
forth
how
it
will
doubtless
be
*NL*
remembered
that
some
time
back
a
painful
sensation
was
created
in
the
*NL*
public
mind
by
a
case
of
mysterious
death
from
opium
occurring
in
the
*NL*
first
floor
of
the
house
occupied
as
a
rag
,
bottle
,
and
general
*NL*
marine
store
shop
,
by
an
eccentric
individual
of
intemperate
habits
,
*NL*
far
advanced
in
life
,
named
Krook
;
and
how
,
by
a
remarkable
*NL*
coincidence
,
Krook
was
examined
at
the
inquest
,
which
it
may
be
*NL*
recollected
was
held
on
that
occasion
at
the
Sol
's
Arms
,
a
*NL*
well-conducted
tavern
immediately
adjoining
the
premises
in
question
*NL*
on
the
west
side
and
licensed
to
a
highly
respectable
landlord
,
Mr.
*NL*
James
George
Bogsby
.
Now
do
they
show
-LRB-
in
as
many
words
as
possible
-RRB-
*NL*
how
during
some
hours
of
yesterday
evening
a
very
peculiar
smell
was
*NL*
observed
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
court
,
in
which
the
tragical
*NL*
occurrence
which
forms
the
subject
of
that
present
account
*NL*
transpired
;
and
which
odour
was
at
one
time
so
powerful
that
Mr.
*NL*
Swills
,
a
comic
vocalist
professionally
engaged
by
Mr.
J.
G.
Bogsby
,
*NL*
has
himself
stated
to
our
reporter
that
he
mentioned
to
Miss
M.
*NL*
Melvilleson
,
a
lady
of
some
pretensions
to
musical
ability
,
likewise
*NL*
engaged
by
Mr.
J.
G.
Bogsby
to
sing
at
a
series
of
concerts
called
*NL*
Harmonic
Assemblies
,
or
Meetings
,
which
it
would
appear
are
held
at
*NL*
the
Sol
's
Arms
under
Mr.
Bogsby
's
direction
pursuant
to
the
Act
of
*NL*
George
the
Second
,
that
he
-LRB-
Mr.
Swills
-RRB-
found
his
voice
seriously
*NL*
affected
by
the
impure
state
of
the
atmosphere
,
his
jocose
expression
*NL*
at
the
time
being
that
he
was
like
an
empty
post-office
,
for
he
*NL*
had
n't
a
single
note
in
him
.
How
this
account
of
Mr.
Swills
is
*NL*
entirely
corroborated
by
two
intelligent
married
females
residing
in
*NL*
the
same
court
and
known
respectively
by
the
names
of
Mrs.
Piper
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Perkins
,
both
of
whom
observed
the
foetid
effluvia
and
regarded
*NL*
them
as
being
emitted
from
the
premises
in
the
occupation
of
Krook
,
*NL*
the
unfortunate
deceased
.
All
this
and
a
great
deal
more
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
who
have
formed
an
amicable
partnership
in
the
melancholy
*NL*
catastrophe
write
down
on
the
spot
;
and
the
boy
population
of
the
*NL*
court
-LRB-
out
of
bed
in
a
moment
-RRB-
swarm
up
the
shutters
of
the
Sol
's
*NL*
Arms
parlour
,
to
behold
the
tops
of
their
heads
while
they
are
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
court
,
adult
as
well
as
boy
,
is
sleepless
for
that
night
,
*NL*
and
can
do
nothing
but
wrap
up
its
many
heads
,
and
talk
of
the
*NL*
ill-fated
house
,
and
look
at
it
.
Miss
Flite
has
been
bravely
rescued
*NL*
from
her
chamber
,
as
if
it
were
in
flames
,
and
accommodated
with
a
*NL*
bed
at
the
Sol
's
Arms
.
The
Sol
neither
turns
off
its
gas
nor
shuts
*NL*
its
door
all
night
,
for
any
kind
of
public
excitement
makes
good
for
*NL*
the
Sol
and
causes
the
court
to
stand
in
need
of
comfort
.
The
house
*NL*
has
not
done
so
much
in
the
stomachic
article
of
cloves
or
in
*NL*
brandy-and-water
warm
since
the
inquest
.
The
moment
the
pot-boy
heard
*NL*
what
had
happened
,
he
rolled
up
his
shirt-sleeves
tight
to
his
*NL*
shoulders
and
said
,
``
There
'll
be
a
run
upon
us
!
''
In
the
first
outcry
,
*NL*
young
Piper
dashed
off
for
the
fire-engines
and
returned
in
triumph
*NL*
at
a
jolting
gallop
perched
up
aloft
on
the
Phoenix
and
holding
on
to
*NL*
that
fabulous
creature
with
all
his
might
in
the
midst
of
helmets
and
*NL*
torches
.
One
helmet
remains
behind
after
careful
investigation
of
all
*NL*
chinks
and
crannies
and
slowly
paces
up
and
down
before
the
house
in
*NL*
company
with
one
of
the
two
policemen
who
have
likewise
been
left
in
*NL*
charge
thereof
.
To
this
trio
everybody
in
the
court
possessed
of
*NL*
sixpence
has
an
insatiate
desire
to
exhibit
hospitality
in
a
liquid
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
and
his
friend
Mr.
Guppy
are
within
the
bar
at
the
Sol
and
*NL*
are
worth
anything
to
the
Sol
that
the
bar
contains
if
they
will
only
*NL*
stay
there
.
``
This
is
not
a
time
,
''
says
Mr.
Bogsby
,
``
to
haggle
about
*NL*
money
,
''
though
he
looks
something
sharply
after
it
,
over
the
counter
;
*NL*
``
give
your
orders
,
you
two
gentlemen
,
and
you
're
welcome
to
whatever
*NL*
you
put
a
name
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
entreated
,
the
two
gentlemen
-LRB-
Mr.
Weevle
especially
-RRB-
put
names
*NL*
to
so
many
things
that
in
course
of
time
they
find
it
difficult
to
*NL*
put
a
name
to
anything
quite
distinctly
,
though
they
still
relate
to
*NL*
all
new-comers
some
version
of
the
night
they
have
had
of
it
,
and
of
*NL*
what
they
said
,
and
what
they
thought
,
and
what
they
saw
.
Meanwhile
,
*NL*
one
or
other
of
the
policemen
often
flits
about
the
door
,
and
pushing
*NL*
it
open
a
little
way
at
the
full
length
of
his
arm
,
looks
in
from
*NL*
outer
gloom
.
Not
that
he
has
any
suspicions
,
but
that
he
may
as
well
*NL*
know
what
they
are
up
to
in
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
night
pursues
its
leaden
course
,
finding
the
court
still
out
of
*NL*
bed
through
the
unwonted
hours
,
still
treating
and
being
treated
,
*NL*
still
conducting
itself
similarly
to
a
court
that
has
had
a
little
*NL*
money
left
it
unexpectedly
.
Thus
night
at
length
with
slow-retreating
*NL*
steps
departs
,
and
the
lamp-lighter
going
his
rounds
,
like
an
*NL*
executioner
to
a
despotic
king
,
strikes
off
the
little
heads
of
fire
*NL*
that
have
aspired
to
lessen
the
darkness
.
Thus
the
day
cometh
,
*NL*
whether
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
day
may
discern
,
even
with
its
dim
London
eye
,
that
the
court
*NL*
has
been
up
all
night
.
Over
and
above
the
faces
that
have
fallen
*NL*
drowsily
on
tables
and
the
heels
that
lie
prone
on
hard
floors
*NL*
instead
of
beds
,
the
brick
and
mortar
physiognomy
of
the
very
court
*NL*
itself
looks
worn
and
jaded
.
And
now
the
neighbourhood
,
waking
up
and
*NL*
beginning
to
hear
of
what
has
happened
,
comes
streaming
in
,
half
*NL*
dressed
,
to
ask
questions
;
and
the
two
policemen
and
the
helmet
-LRB-
who
*NL*
are
far
less
impressible
externally
than
the
court
-RRB-
have
enough
to
do
*NL*
to
keep
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
gentlemen
!
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
coming
up
.
``
What
's
this
*NL*
I
hear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
true
,
''
returns
one
of
the
policemen
.
``
That
's
what
it
is
.
*NL*
Now
move
on
here
,
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
good
gracious
,
gentlemen
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
somewhat
promptly
*NL*
backed
away
,
``
I
was
at
this
door
last
night
betwixt
ten
and
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
in
conversation
with
the
young
man
who
lodges
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
returns
the
policeman
.
``
You
will
find
the
young
man
next
*NL*
door
then
.
Now
move
on
here
,
some
of
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
hurt
,
I
hope
?
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurt
?
No
.
What
's
to
hurt
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
,
wholly
unable
to
answer
this
or
any
question
in
his
*NL*
troubled
mind
,
repairs
to
the
Sol
's
Arms
and
finds
Mr.
Weevle
*NL*
languishing
over
tea
and
toast
with
a
considerable
expression
on
him
*NL*
of
exhausted
excitement
and
exhausted
tobacco-smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.
Guppy
likewise
!
''
quoth
Mr.
Snagsby
.
``
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
What
*NL*
a
fate
there
seems
in
all
this
!
And
my
lit

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
's
power
of
speech
deserts
him
in
the
formation
of
the
*NL*
words
``
my
little
woman
.
''
For
to
see
that
injured
female
walk
into
the
*NL*
Sol
's
Arms
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
and
stand
before
the
*NL*
beer-engine
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
like
an
accusing
spirit
,
*NL*
strikes
him
dumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
when
his
tongue
is
loosened
,
``
will
you
*NL*
take
anything
?
A
little
--
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon

*NL*
shrub
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

says
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

you
know
these

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
says
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
and
in
a
rigid
manner
acknowledges
their
*NL*
presence
,
still
fixing
Mr.
Snagsby
with
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
devoted
Mr.
Snagsby
can
not
bear
this
treatment
.
He
takes
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
by
the
hand
and
leads
her
aside
to
an
adjacent
cask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
woman
,
why
do
you
look
at
me
in
that
way

Pray

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

says
Mrs.

,
``

if

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
,
with
his
cough
of
meekness
,
rejoins
,
``
Would
n't
you
*NL*
really
,
my

and
meditates
.
Then
coughs
his
cough
of
trouble
and
*NL*
says
,
``
This
is
a
dreadful
mystery
,
my
love

''
still
fearfully
*NL*
disconcerted
by
Mrs.
Snagsby
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

returns
Mrs.

,
shaking
her
head
,
``
a
dreadful
*NL*
mystery

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

urges
Mr.

in
a
piteous
manner
,

*NL*
*NL*
``

returns
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
On
a
hasty
review
of
his
unfortunate
position
,
Mr.
Snagsby
``
ca

either
.
He
is
not
prepared
positively
to
deny
that
he
may
have
*NL*
had
something
to
do
with

He
has
had
something
--
he
do

what

to
do
with
so
much
in
this
connexion
that
is
mysterious

it

is
possible
he
may
even
be
implicated
,
without
knowing
it

in
the
*NL*
present
transaction

He
faintly
wipes
his
forehead
with
his
*NL*
handkerchief
and
gasps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

says
the
unhappy

made

sinister

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
casts
his
eye
forlornly
round
the
bar
,
gives
Messrs.
*NL*
Weevle
and
Guppy
good
morning
,
assures
them
of
the
satisfaction
with
*NL*
which
he
sees
them
uninjured
,
and
accompanies
Mrs.
Snagsby
from
the
*NL*
Sol
's
Arms
.
Before
night
his
doubt
whether
he
may
not
be
responsible
*NL*
for
some
inconceivable
part
in
the
catastrophe
which
is
the
talk
of
*NL*
the
whole
neighbourhood
is
almost
resolved
into
certainty
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
's
pertinacity
in
that
fixed
gaze
.
His
mental
sufferings
are
*NL*
so
great
that
he
entertains
wandering
ideas
of
delivering
himself
up
*NL*
to
justice
and
requiring
to
be
cleared
if
innocent
and
punished
with
*NL*
the
utmost
rigour
of
the

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
and
Mr.
Guppy
,
having
taken
their
breakfast
,
step
into
*NL*
Lincoln

to
take
a
little
walk
about
the
square

clear
as

out

returns
the

eyeing
his

with
a
bloodshot
eye
.

*NL*
*NL*
This
supposititious

is
so
very
disagreeable
to
Mr.

that
his
voice
quakes
as
he
says
in
a
moral
way
,

To

*NL*
Mr.

returns
,
``

To

Mr.

says
,
``
Who
's
conspiring

To

Mr.

Jobling
replies
,
``
Why

To
which
Mr.

retorts
,
``
No

both
being
now
in

heated

they
walk
on
silently
for
a
while
to
cool
down
again
.

Mr.

Finding
his

in
this
morose

condition

Mr.

*NL*
only
expresses
the
finer
feelings
of
his
soul
through
the
tone
of

injury

he
recommences
,
``

While
they
are
so
conversing

a
hackney-coach
drives
into
the
square

*NL*
on
the
box
of
which
vehicle
a
very
tall
hat
makes
itself
manifest
to

the
public

Inside
the
coach
,
and
consequently
not
so
manifest
to
the

multitude
,
though
sufficiently
so
to

two

almost
at

the
venerable
Mr.

Mrs.

Smallweed
,
accompanied
by
their
granddaughter
Judy

*NL*
*NL*
An
air
of
haste
and
excitement
pervades
the
party
,
and
as
the
tall
*NL*
hat
-LRB-
surmounting
Mr.

the
younger
-RRB-
alights
,
Mr.
Smallweed
*NL*
the
elder
pokes
his
head
out
of

and
bawls
to
Mr.

``

Mr.

looks
at
his

repeating
inquiringly

``

And
they
prepare
to
bear
the
venerable
*NL*
burden
to
the
Sol

Arms

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
your

says
the
patriarch
to
the
coachman
with
a
fierce

grin

shaking
his
incapable
fist
at
him

It
is
well
that
the
Sol
is
not
far
off
,
for
Mr.
Weevle
presents
an
*NL*
apoplectic
appearance
before
half
the
distance
is
accomplished
.
With
*NL*
no
worse
aggravation
of
his
symptoms
,
however
,
than
the
utterance
of
*NL*
divers
croaking
sounds
expressive
of
obstructed
respiration
,
he
*NL*
fulfils
his
share
of
the
porterage
and
the
benevolent
old
gentleman
*NL*
is
deposited
by
his
own
desire
in
the
parlour
of
the
Sol

Arms

*NL*
``
Oh

gasps
Mr.

looking

breathless

from

an
arm-chair

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
apostrophe
to
Mrs.
Smallweed
is
occasioned
by
a
*NL*
propensity
on
the
part
of
that
unlucky
old
lady
whenever
she
finds
*NL*
herself
on
her
feet
to
amble
about
and
``
set
''
to
inanimate
objects
,
*NL*
accompanying
herself
with
a
chattering
noise
,
as
in
a
witch
dance
.
A
*NL*
nervous
affection
has
probably
as
much
to
do
with
these
*NL*
demonstrations
as
any
imbecile
intention
in
the
poor
old
woman
,
but
*NL*
on
the
present
occasion
they
are
so
particularly
lively
in
connexion
*NL*
with
the
Windsor
arm-chair
,
fellow
to
that
in
which
Mr.
Smallweed
is
*NL*
seated
,
that
she
only
quite
desists
when
her
grandchildren
have
held
*NL*
her
down
in
it
,
her
lord
in
the
meanwhile
bestowing
upon
her
,
with
*NL*
great
volubility
,
the
endearing
epithet
of
``
a
pig-headed
jackdaw

*NL*
repeated
a
surprising
number
of
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Grandfather

then
proceeds

addressing
Mr.

black-beetle

seventy-six
years
*NL*
of
age

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Smallweed
instantly
begins
to
shake
her
head
and
pipe
up
,
*NL*
``
Seventy-six
pound
seven
and
sevenpence
!
Seventy-six
thousand
bags
of

money

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
somebody
give
me
a
quart
pot
?
''
exclaims
her
exasperated
*NL*
husband
,
looking
helplessly
about
him
and
finding
no
missile
within
*NL*
his
reach
.
``
Will
somebody
obleege
me
with
a
spittoon

Will
somebody
*NL*
hand
me
anything
hard

you

*NL*
you

you
brimstone
barker

''
Here
Mr.
Smallweed
,
wrought
up
to
the
*NL*
highest
pitch
by
his
own
eloquence
,
actually
throws
Judy
at
her
*NL*
grandmother
in
default
of
anything
else
,
by
butting
that
young
virgin
*NL*
at
the
old
lady
with
such
force
as
he
can
muster
and
then
dropping
*NL*
into
his
chair
in
a
heap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shake
me
up
,
somebody
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
,
''
says
the
voice
from
*NL*
within
the
faintly
struggling
bundle
into
which
he
has
collapsed
.
``
I
*NL*
have
come
to
look
after
the
property

Shake
me
up

and
call
in

''
As
his
dutiful
grandchildren
set
him
up
,
panting
,
and
*NL*
putting
him
through
the
usual
restorative
process
of
shaking
and
*NL*
punching
,
he
still
repeats
like
an
echo
,
``
The
--
the
property
!
The
*NL*
property
!
Property
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
and
Mr.
Guppy
look
at
each
other
,
the
former
as
having
*NL*
relinquished
the
whole
affair
,
the
latter
with
a
discomfited
*NL*
countenance
as
having
entertained
some
lingering
expectations
yet
.
*NL*
But
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
opposition
to
the
Smallweed
*NL*
interest
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
clerk
comes
down
from
his
official
pew
in
*NL*
the
chambers
to
mention
to
the
police
that
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
*NL*
answerable
for
its
being
all
correct
about
the
next
of
kin
and
that
*NL*
the
papers
and
effects
will
be
formally
taken
possession
of
in
due
*NL*
time
and
course
.
Mr.
Smallweed
is
at
once
permitted
so
far
to
assert
*NL*
his
supremacy
as
to
be
carried
on
a
visit
of
sentiment
into
the
next
*NL*
house
and
upstairs
into
Miss
Flite
's
deserted
room
,
where
he
looks
*NL*
like
a
hideous
bird
of
prey
newly
added
to
her
aviary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
this
unexpected
heir
soon
taking
wind
in
the
court
*NL*
still
makes
good
for
the
Sol
and
keeps
the
court
upon
its
mettle
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Piper
and
Mrs.
Perkins
think
it
hard
upon
the
young
man
if
there
*NL*
really
is
no
will
,
and
consider
that
a
handsome
present
ought
to
be
*NL*
made
him
out
of
the
estate
.
Young
Piper
and
young
Perkins
,
as
members
*NL*
of
that
restless
juvenile
circle
which
is
the
terror
of
the
*NL*
foot-passengers
in
Chancery
Lane
,
crumble
into
ashes
behind
the
pump
*NL*
and
under
the
archway
all
day
long
,
where
wild
yells
and
hootings
*NL*
take
place
over
their
remains
.
Little
Swills
and
Miss
M.
Melvilleson
*NL*
enter
into
affable
conversation
with
their
patrons
,
feeling
that
*NL*
these
unusual
occurrences
level
the
barriers
between
professionals
*NL*
and
non-professionals
.
Mr.
Bogsby
puts
up
``
The
popular
song
of
King
*NL*
Death
,
with
chorus
by
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
,
''
as
the
*NL*
great
Harmonic
feature
of
the
week
and
announces
in
the
bill
that
``
J.
*NL*
G.
B.
is
induced
to
do
so
at
a
considerable
extra
expense
in
*NL*
consequence
of
a
wish
which
has
been
very
generally
expressed
at
the
*NL*
bar
by
a
large
body
of
respectable
individuals
and
in
homage
to
a
*NL*
late
melancholy
event
which
has
aroused
so
much
sensation
.
''
There
is
*NL*
one
point
connected
with
the
deceased
upon
which
the
court
is
*NL*
particularly
anxious
,
namely
,
that
the
fiction
of
a
full-sized
coffin
*NL*
should
be
preserved
,
though
there
is
so
little
to
put
in
it
.
Upon
the
*NL*
undertaker
's
stating
in
the
Sol
's
bar
in
the
course
of
the
day
that
*NL*
he
has
received
orders
to
construct
``
a
six-footer
,
''
the
general
*NL*
solicitude
is
much
relieved
,
and
it
is
considered
that
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
's
conduct
does
him
great
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
the
court
,
and
a
long
way
out
of
it
,
there
is
considerable
*NL*
excitement
too
,
for
men
of
science
and
philosophy
come
to
look
,
and
*NL*
carriages
set
down
doctors
at
the
corner
who
arrive
with
the
same
*NL*
intent
,
and
there
is
more
learned
talk
about
inflammable
gases
and
*NL*
phosphuretted
hydrogen
than
the
court
has
ever
imagined
.
Some
of
*NL*
these
authorities
-LRB-
of
course
the
wisest
-RRB-
hold
with
indignation
that
*NL*
the
deceased
had
no
business
to
die
in
the
alleged
manner
;
and
being
*NL*
reminded
by
other
authorities
of
a
certain
inquiry
into
the
evidence
*NL*
for
such
deaths
reprinted
in
the
sixth
volume
of
the
Philosophical
*NL*
Transactions
;
and
also
of
a
book
not
quite
unknown
on
English
medical
*NL*
jurisprudence
;
and
likewise
of
the
Italian
case
of
the
Countess
*NL*
Cornelia
Baudi
as
set
forth
in
detail
by
one
Bianchini
,
prebendary
of
*NL*
Verona
,
who
wrote
a
scholarly
work
or
so
and
was
occasionally
heard
*NL*
of
in
his
time
as
having
gleams
of
reason
in
him
;
and
also
of
the
*NL*
testimony
of
Messrs.
Fodere
and
Mere
,
two
pestilent
Frenchmen
who
*NL*
WOULD
investigate
the
subject
;
and
further
,
of
the
corroborative
*NL*
testimony
of
Monsieur
Le
Cat
,
a
rather
celebrated
French
surgeon
once
*NL*
upon
a
time
,
who
had
the
unpoliteness
to
live
in
a
house
where
such
a
*NL*
case
occurred
and
even
to
write
an
account
of
it
--
still
they
regard
*NL*
the
late
Mr.
Krook
's
obstinacy
in
going
out
of
the
world
by
any
such
*NL*
by-way
as
wholly
unjustifiable
and
personally
offensive
.
The
less
the
*NL*
court
understands
of
all
this
,
the
more
the
court
likes
it
,
and
the
*NL*
greater
enjoyment
it
has
in
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
Sol
's
Arms
.
*NL*
Then
there
comes
the
artist
of
a
picture
newspaper
,
with
a
foreground
*NL*
and
figures
ready
drawn
for
anything
from
a
wreck
on
the
Cornish
*NL*
coast
to
a
review
in
Hyde
Park
or
a
meeting
in
Manchester
,
and
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Perkins
'
own
room
,
memorable
evermore
,
he
then
and
there
throws
*NL*
in
upon
the
block
Mr.
Krook
's
house
,
as
large
as
life
;
in
fact
,
*NL*
considerably
larger
,
making
a
very
temple
of
it
.
Similarly
,
being
*NL*
permitted
to
look
in
at
the
door
of
the
fatal
chamber
,
he
depicts
*NL*
that
apartment
as
three-quarters
of
a
mile
long
by
fifty
yards
high
,
*NL*
at
which
the
court
is
particularly
charmed
.
All
this
time
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
before
mentioned
pop
in
and
out
of
every
house
and
assist
*NL*
at
the
philosophical
disputations
--
go
everywhere
and
listen
to
*NL*
everybody
--
and
yet
are
always
diving
into
the
Sol
's
parlour
and
*NL*
writing
with
the
ravenous
little
pens
on
the
tissue-paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
come
the
coroner
and
his
inquiry
,
like
as
before
,
except
that
*NL*
the
coroner
cherishes
this
case
as
being
out
of
the
common
way
and
*NL*
tells
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
in
his
private
capacity
,
that
``
that
*NL*
would
seem
to
be
an
unlucky
house
next
door
,
gentlemen
,
a
destined
*NL*
house
;
but
so
we
sometimes
find
it
,
and
these
are
mysteries
we
ca
n't
*NL*
account
for
!
''
After
which
the
six-footer
comes
into
action
and
is
*NL*
much
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
these
proceedings
Mr.
Guppy
has
so
slight
a
part
,
except
when
*NL*
he
gives
his
evidence
,
that
he
is
moved
on
like
a
private
individual
*NL*
and
can
only
haunt
the
secret
house
on
the
outside
,
where
he
has
the
*NL*
mortification
of
seeing
Mr.
Smallweed
padlocking
the
door
,
and
of
*NL*
bitterly
knowing
himself
to
be
shut
out
.
But
before
these
proceedings
*NL*
draw
to
a
close
,
that
is
to
say
,
on
the
night
next
after
the
*NL*
catastrophe
,
Mr.
Guppy
has
a
thing
to
say
that
must
be
said
to
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
which
reason
,
with
a
sinking
heart
and
with
that
hang-dog
sense
*NL*
of
guilt
upon
him
which
dread
and
watching
enfolded
in
the
Sol
's
Arms
*NL*
have
produced
,
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
presents
himself
at
*NL*
the
town
mansion
at
about
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
and
requests
*NL*
to
see
her
ladyship
.
Mercury
replies
that
she
is
going
out
to
dinner
;
*NL*
do
n't
he
see
the
carriage
at
the
door
?
Yes
,
he
does
see
the
carriage
*NL*
at
the
door
;
but
he
wants
to
see
my
Lady
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercury
is
disposed
,
as
he
will
presently
declare
to
a
*NL*
fellow-gentleman
in
waiting
,
``
to
pitch
into
the
young
man
''
;
but
his
*NL*
instructions
are
positive
.
Therefore
he
sulkily
supposes
that
the
*NL*
young
man
must
come
up
into
the
library
.
There
he
leaves
the
young
*NL*
man
in
a
large
room
,
not
over-light
,
while
he
makes
report
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
looks
into
the
shade
in
all
directions
,
discovering
*NL*
everywhere
a
certain
charred
and
whitened
little
heap
of
coal
or
*NL*
wood
.
Presently
he
hears
a
rustling
.
Is
it
--
?
No
,
it
's
no
ghost
,
but
*NL*
fair
flesh
and
blood
,
most
brilliantly
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
beg
your
ladyship
's
pardon
,
''
Mr.
Guppy
stammers
,
very
*NL*
downcast
.
``
This
is
an
inconvenient
time
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
,
you
could
come
at
any
time
.
''
She
takes
a
chair
,
looking
*NL*
straight
at
him
as
on
the
last
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
your
ladyship
.
Your
ladyship
is
very
affable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
sit
down
.
''
There
is
not
much
affability
in
her
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
your
ladyship
,
that
it
's
worth
while
my
sitting
down
*NL*
and
detaining
you
,
for
I
--
I
have
not
got
the
letters
that
I
mentioned
*NL*
when
I
had
the
honour
of
waiting
on
your
ladyship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
come
merely
to
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
to
say
so
,
your
ladyship
.
''
Mr.
Guppy
besides
being
depressed
,
*NL*
disappointed
,
and
uneasy
,
is
put
at
a
further
disadvantage
by
the
*NL*
splendour
and
beauty
of
her
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knows
its
influence
perfectly
,
has
studied
it
too
well
to
miss
a
*NL*
grain
of
its
effect
on
any
one
.
As
she
looks
at
him
so
steadily
and
*NL*
coldly
,
he
not
only
feels
conscious
that
he
has
no
guide
in
the
least
*NL*
perception
of
what
is
really
the
complexion
of
her
thoughts
,
but
also
*NL*
that
he
is
being
every
moment
,
as
it
were
,
removed
further
and
*NL*
further
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
will
not
speak
,
it
is
plain
.
So
he
must
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
your
ladyship
,
''
says
Mr.
Guppy
like
a
meanly
penitent
*NL*
thief
,
``
the
person
I
was
to
have
had
the
letters
of
,
has
come
to
a
*NL*
sudden
end
,
and
--
''
He
stops
.
Lady
Dedlock
calmly
finishes
the
*NL*
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
letters
are
destroyed
with
the
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
would
say
no
if
he
could
--
as
he
is
unable
to
hide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
your
ladyship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
could
see
the
least
sparkle
of
relief
in
her
face
now
?
No
,
he
*NL*
could
see
no
such
thing
,
even
if
that
brave
outside
did
not
utterly
*NL*
put
him
away
,
and
he
were
not
looking
beyond
it
and
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
falters
an
awkward
excuse
or
two
for
his
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
all
you
have
to
say
?
''
inquires
Lady
Dedlock
,
having
heard
*NL*
him
out
--
or
as
nearly
out
as
he
can
stumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
thinks
that
's
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
be
sure
that
you
wish
to
say
nothing
more
to
me
,
this
*NL*
being
the
last
time
you
will
have
the
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
is
quite
sure
.
And
indeed
he
has
no
such
wish
at
present
,
*NL*
by
any
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
enough
.
I
will
dispense
with
excuses
.
Good
evening
to
you
!
''
*NL*
And
she
rings
for
Mercury
to
show
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
that
house
,
in
that
same
moment
,
there
happens
to
be
an
old
*NL*
man
of
the
name
of
Tulkinghorn
.
And
that
old
man
,
coming
with
his
*NL*
quiet
footstep
to
the
library
,
has
his
hand
at
that
moment
on
the
*NL*
handle
of
the
door
--
comes
in
--
and
comes
face
to
face
with
the
young
*NL*
man
as
he
is
leaving
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
glance
between
the
old
man
and
the
lady
,
and
for
an
instant
the
*NL*
blind
that
is
always
down
flies
up
.
Suspicion
,
eager
and
sharp
,
looks
*NL*
out
.
Another
instant
,
close
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Lady
Dedlock
.
I
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
.
*NL*
It
is
so
very
unusual
to
find
you
here
at
this
hour
.
I
supposed
the
*NL*
room
was
empty
.
I
beg
your
pardon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
She
negligently

The

A
Turn

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
,
''
says
Mr.
George
,
``
may
this
be
?
Is
it
blank
cartridge
or
*NL*
ball

A
flash

''
*NL*
*NL*
An
open
letter
is
the
subject
of
the
trooper
's
speculations
,
and
it
*NL*
seems
to
perplex
him
mightily
.
He
looks
at
it
at
arm
's
length
,
brings
*NL*
it
close
to
him
,
holds
it
in
his
right
hand
,
holds
it
in
his
left
*NL*
hand
,
reads
it
with
his
head
on
this
side
,
with
his
head
on
that
*NL*
side
,
contracts
his
eyebrows
,
elevates
them
,
still
can
not
satisfy
*NL*
himself
.
He
smooths
it
out
upon
the
table
with
his
heavy
palm
,
and
*NL*
thoughtfully
walking
up
and
down
the
gallery
,
makes
a
halt
before
it
*NL*
every
now
and
then
to
come
upon
it
with
a
fresh
eye
.
Even
that
wo

*NL*
do
.
``
Is
it

Mr.
George
still
muses
,
``
blank
cartridge

*NL*
*NL*
Phil
Squod
,
with
the
aid
of
a
brush
and
paint-pot
,
is
employed
in
the
*NL*
distance
whitening
the
targets
,
softly
whistling
in
quick-march
time
*NL*
and
in
drum-and-fife
manner
that
he
must
and
will
go
back
again
to
*NL*
the
girl
he
left
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phil

''
The
trooper
beckons
as
he
calls
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
approaches
in
his
usual
way
,
sidling
off
at
first
as
if
he
were
*NL*
going
anywhere
else
and
then
bearing
down
upon
his
commander
like
a
*NL*
bayonet-charge
.
Certain
splashes
of
white
show
in
high
relief
upon
*NL*
his
dirty
face
,
and
he
scrapes
his
one
eyebrow
with
the
handle
of
the
*NL*
brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

Phil
after
pensively
tracing
out
a
cross-wrinkle

in
his
forehead
with
the
brush-handle
,

the

sitting
on

*NL*
*NL*
Phil
intimates
by
sidling
back
a
pace
or
two
,
with
a
very
*NL*
unaccountable
wrench
of
his
wry
face
,
that
he
does
not
regard
the
*NL*
transaction
as
being
made
more
promising
by
this
incident
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
lookye
further
,
Phil
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
staying
his
premature
*NL*
conclusions
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
.
``
There
has
always
been
an
*NL*
understanding
that
this

was
to
be

has
been
renewed
no

of

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

Humph

*NL*
*NL*
``

Phil
with
exceeding
gravity

*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
expressively
uttered
his
sentiments
,
Mr.
Squod
,
after
*NL*
waiting
a
little
to
ascertain
if
any
further
remark
be
expected
of
*NL*
him
,
gets
back
by
his
usual
series
of
movements
to
the
target
he
has
*NL*
in
hand
and
vigorously
signifies
through
his
former
musical
medium
*NL*
that
he
must
and
he
will
return
to
that
ideal
young
lady
.
George
,
*NL*
having
folded
the
letter
,
walks
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
IS
a
way

says
Phil
,
looking
cunningly
at
him
,
``

*NL*
``
Paying

shakes
his

says
Phil
with
a
highly
artistic
turn
of
his
brush
;
``
what
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whitewashing

*NL*
Phil
nods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Do

what

Do

be
ruined
to
pay

old

YOU
'RE

moral
character

''
says
the
trooper
,
eyeing
him
*NL*
in
his
large
way
with
no
small
indignation
;
``
upon
my
life
you
are

*NL*
Phil

''
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
,
on
one
knee
at
the
target
,
is
in
course
of
protesting
*NL*
earnestly
,
though
not
without
many
allegorical
scoops
of
his
brush
*NL*
and
smoothings
of
the
white
surface
round
the
rim
with
his
thumb
,
*NL*
that
he
had
forgotten
the
Bagnet
responsibility
and
would
not
so
much
*NL*
as
injure
a
hair
of
the
head
of
any
member
of
that
worthy
family
when
*NL*
steps
are
audible
in
the
long
passage
without
,
and
a
cheerful
voice
*NL*
is
heard
to
wonder
whether
George
is
at
home
.
Phil
,
with
a
look
at
*NL*
his
master
,
hobbles
up
,
saying
,
``
Here
's
the
guv
`
ner
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
!
*NL*
Here
he
is
!
''
and
the
old
girl
herself
,
accompanied
by
Mr.
Bagnet
,
*NL*
appears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
girl
never
appears
in
walking
trim
,
in
any
season
of
the
*NL*
year
,
without
a
grey
cloth
cloak
,
coarse
and
much
worn
but
very
*NL*
clean
,
which
is
,
undoubtedly
,
the
identical
garment
rendered
so
*NL*
interesting
to
Mr.
Bagnet
by
having
made
its
way
home
to
Europe
from
*NL*
another
quarter
of
the
globe
in
company
with
Mrs.
Bagnet
and
an
*NL*
umbrella
.
The
latter
faithful
appendage
is
also
invariably
a
part
of
*NL*
the
old
girl
's
presence
out
of
doors
.
It
is
of
no
colour
known
in
*NL*
this
life
and
has
a
corrugated
wooden
crook
for
a
handle
,
with
a
*NL*
metallic
object
let
into
its
prow
,
or
beak
,
resembling
a
little
model
*NL*
of
a
fanlight
over
a
street
door
or
one
of
the
oval
glasses
out
of
a
*NL*
pair
of
spectacles
,
which
ornamental
object
has
not
that
tenacious
*NL*
capacity
of
sticking
to
its
post
that
might
be
desired
in
an
article
*NL*
long
associated
with
the
British
army
.
The
old
girl
's
umbrella
is
of
*NL*
a
flabby
habit
of
waist
and
seems
to
be
in
need
of
stays
--
an
*NL*
appearance
that
is
possibly
referable
to
its
having
served
through
a
*NL*
series
of
years
at
home
as
a
cupboard
and
on
journeys
as
a
carpet
*NL*
bag
.
She
never
puts
it
up
,
having
the
greatest
reliance
on
her
*NL*
well-proved
cloak
with
its
capacious
hood
,
but
generally
uses
the
*NL*
instrument
as
a
wand
with
which
to
point
out
joints
of
meat
or
*NL*
bunches
of
greens
in
marketing
or
to
arrest
the
attention
of
*NL*
tradesmen
by
a
friendly
poke
.
Without
her
market-basket
,
which
is
a
*NL*
sort
of
wicker
well
with
two
flapping
lids
,
she
never
stirs
abroad
.
*NL*
Attended
by
these
her
trusty
companions
,
therefore
,
her
honest
*NL*
sunburnt
face
looking
cheerily
out
of
a
rough
straw
bonnet
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
now
arrives
,
fresh-coloured
and
bright
,
in
George
's
Shooting
*NL*
Gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
George
,
old
fellow
,
''
says
she
,
``
and
how
do
YOU
do
,
this
*NL*
sunshiny
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Giving
him
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
draws
a
long
*NL*
breath
after
her
walk
and
sits
down
to
enjoy
a
rest
.
Having
a
*NL*
faculty
,
matured
on
the
tops
of
baggage-waggons
and
in
other
such
*NL*
positions
,
of
resting
easily
anywhere
,
she
perches
on
a
rough
bench
,
*NL*
unties
her
bonnet-strings
,
pushes
back
her
bonnet
,
crosses
her
arms
,
*NL*
and
looks
perfectly
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
in
the
meantime
has
shaken
hands
with
his
old
comrade
and
*NL*
with
Phil
,
on
whom
Mrs.
Bagnet
likewise
bestows
a
good-humoured
nod
*NL*
and
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
George
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bagnet
briskly
,
``
here
we
are
,
Lignum
and
*NL*
myself

--
she
often
speaks
of
her
husband
by
this
appellation
,
on
*NL*
account
,
as
it
is
supposed
,
of
Lignum
Vitae
having
been
his
old
*NL*
regimental
nickname
when
they
first
became
acquainted
,
in
compliment
*NL*
to
the
extreme
hardness
and
toughness
of
his
physiognomy
--
``
just
*NL*
looked
in

we
have

to
make
it
all
correct

Give
him

sign
it

like

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was

observes
the
trooper
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

thought

the
best

to
mind
his
sisters

came
to
you
instead

as
you
see

For
Lignum
,
he
's
tied
so
close
now
,
*NL*
and
gets
so
little
exercise
,
that
a
walk
does
him
good
.
But
what
's
*NL*
the
matter

George

asks
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
stopping
in
her
cheerful
talk
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
quite
myself

returns
the
trooper
;
``
I
have
been
a
little
*NL*
put
out

Bagnet

*NL*
*NL*
Her
bright
quick
eye
catches
the
truth
directly
.
``

holding
up
*NL*
her
forefinger
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
looks
at
her
with
a
troubled
visage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
''
says
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
using
both
her
arms
for
emphasis
and
*NL*
occasionally
bringing
down
her
open
hands
upon
her
knees
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
,
otherwise
as
immovable
as
a
pump
or
a
lamp-post
,
puts
his
*NL*
large
right
hand
on
the
top
of
his
bald
head
as
if
to
defend
it
from
*NL*
a
shower-bath
and
looks
with
great
uneasiness
at
Mrs.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``

says
that
old

Mrs.

gathers
up
her

cloak
to
wipe
her

Mrs.
Bagnet
ceasing
,
Mr.
Bagnet
removes
his
hand
from
his
head
as
if
*NL*
the
shower-bath
were
over
and
looks
disconsolately
at
Mr.
George
,
who
*NL*
has
turned
quite
white
and
looks
distressfully
at
the
grey
cloak
and

straw
bonnet

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
the

in
a
subdued
voice
,
addressing
him

still
*NL*
looking
at
his
wife
,
``
I
am
sorry

I
AM

it

Mrs.

giving

one
of

honest

giving
her

husband
the
other
,
Mr.

gives
each
of

one
of
his
and
holds
*NL*
them
while

speaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
assure
you

there

nothing

But
whatever
I
have
been
able
to
scrape
together
has
*NL*
gone
every
two
months
in
keeping
it
up
.
We
have
lived
plainly
enough
*NL*
here
,
Phil

I

But
the

do

quite
do
what
was
expected
of

it

it
's
not

in

it

not

It
was
wrong

take
it

Well

so
it
was

But
I
was
in
a
manner
drawn
into
that
step

I
thought
it
might
steady
me
,
and
set
me
up
,
and
you
'll
try
to

overlook
my
having
such
expectations

upon

I
am
very

obliged

With
these
*NL*
concluding
words
,
Mr.

gives
a
shake
to
each
of
the
hands
he
*NL*
holds
,
and
relinquishing
them
,
backs
a
pace
or
two
in
a
*NL*
broad-chested
,
upright
attitude
,
as
if
he
had
made
a
final
confession
*NL*

were
immediately
going
to
be
shot
with
all
military
honours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
being
in
this
singular
manner
heard
out
,
has
merely
to
*NL*
observe
that
the
letter
must
be
attended
to
without
any
delay
,
that
*NL*
it
is
advisable
that
George
and
he
should
immediately
wait
on
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
in
person
,
and
that
the
primary
object
is
to
save
and
hold
*NL*
harmless
Mr.
Bagnet
,
who
had
none
of
the
money
.
Mr.
George
,
entirely
*NL*
assenting
,
puts
on
his
hat
and
prepares
to
march
with
Mr.
Bagnet
to
*NL*
the
enemy
's
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
mind
a

hasty
word

George

''
says
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
*NL*
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
.
``
I
trust
my
old
Lignum
to
you
,
and
I
am
*NL*
sure

'll
bring

*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
returns
that
this
is
kindly
said
and
that
he
WILL
bring
*NL*
Lignum
through
it
somehow
.
Upon
which
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
with
her
cloak
,
*NL*
basket
,
and
umbrella
,
goes
home
,
bright-eyed
again
,
to
the
rest
of
*NL*
her
family
,
and
the
comrades
sally
forth
on
the
hopeful
errand
of
*NL*
mollifying
Mr.
Smallweed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
there
are
two
people
in
England
less
likely
to
come
*NL*
satisfactorily
out
of
any
negotiation
with
Mr.
Smallweed
than
Mr.
*NL*
George
and
Mr.
Matthew
Bagnet
may
be
very
reasonably
questioned
.
*NL*
Also
,
notwithstanding
their
martial
appearance
,
broad
square
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
heavy
tread
,
whether
there
are
within
the
same
limits
*NL*
two
more
simple
and
unaccustomed
children
in
all
the
Smallweedy
*NL*
affairs
of
life

As
they
proceed
with
great
gravity
through
the
*NL*
streets
towards
the
region
of
Mount
Pleasant
,
Mr.
Bagnet
,
observing
*NL*
his
companion
to
be
thoughtful
,
considers
it
a
friendly
part
to
refer
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
late
sally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
you
know
the

sweet

touch
her
on
the
children

myself

and
she
's
off
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
her
credit

looking
straight
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

Mr.

take
that
weight

in
any

metal

for

No

Why
not

Because

us

stands
to

fires

wide

once
in

way

at

call

look
over

the

of

``

says
Mr.
Bagnet
with
the
warmest
enthusiasm
,
though
*NL*
without
relaxing
the
rigidity
of
a
single
muscle
.
``
Think
as
high
of

rock

still

thinking

low

never
own

*NL*
These
encomiums
bring
them
to
Mount
Pleasant
and
to
Grandfather
*NL*
Smallweed
's
house
.
The
door
is
opened
by
the
perennial
Judy
,
who
,
*NL*
having
surveyed
them
from
top
to
toe
with
no
particular
favour
,
but
*NL*
indeed
with
a
malignant
sneer
,
leaves
them
standing
there
while
she
*NL*
consults
the
oracle
as
to
their
admission
.
The
oracle
may
be
inferred
*NL*
to
give
consent
from
the
circumstance
of
her
returning
with
the
words
*NL*
on
her
honey
lips
that
they
can
come
in
if
they
want
to
it

Thus
*NL*
privileged
,
they
come
in
and
find
Mr.
Smallweed
with
his
feet
in
the
*NL*
drawer
of
his
chair
as
if
it
were
a
paper
foot-bath
and
Mrs.

Smallweed
obscured
with
the
cushion
like
a
bird
that
is
not
to
sing

*NL*
``

affectionate

forth

in

ugly

constraining

can

holding

the

swallowing
his

Mr.

replies
with
excellent
temper

``
Ah

That

quite
*NL*
another

And
adds
,
``
But
it

*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
George
makes
a
great
effort
to
arrange
the
affair
*NL*
comfortably
and
to
propitiate
Mr.

by
taking
him
upon
his
*NL*
own
terms

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

liable

be
fixed

Now
,
you
see
,
that
makes
his

very
uneasy
in
her
mind

and
me
too

I
'm
a
*NL*
harum-scarum

a
good-for-nought

more

natural

says
the
trooper
,
gaining
confidence
as
he
proceeds
*NL*
in
his
soldierly
mode
of
doing
business
,
``
although
you

*NL*

There
is
an
ogreish
kind
of
jocularity
in
Grandfather

*NL*
to-day

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

*NL*
*NL*
``

echoes
Grandfather
Smallweed

In
such
a
very
hard
manner
*NL*
and
with
eyes
so
particularly
green
that
Mr.
Bagnet
's
natural
gravity
*NL*
is
much
deepened
by
the
contemplation
of
that
venerable
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

says
the
sanguine
George

I

*NL*
*NL*
Here
some
shrill
spectre
cries
out
in
a
mocking
manner

``
Oh

good
*NL*
gracious
!
Oh
!

Unless

indeed
,
it
be
the
sportive
Judy

who
is
found
*NL*
to
be
silent
when
the
startled
visitors
look
round
,
but
whose
chin
*NL*
has
received
a
recent
toss
,
expressive
of
derision
and
contempt

Mr.

Bagnet
's
gravity
becomes
yet
more
profound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

old
Smallweed

who
all
this

has
had
the
pipe
in

the
speaker

*NL*

returns
the

in

off-hand

``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
purposely
balking
himself
in
an
aim
at
the
trooper

*NL*
head
,
throws
the
pipe
on
the
ground
and
breaks
it
to
pieces

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
rise
and
look
at
one
another

Mr.

's
gravity
*NL*
has
now
attained
its
profoundest
point

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

repeats
the

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
He
vociferates
this
so
loudly
that
Mr.
Bagnet
,
laying
his
hands
on
*NL*
the
shoulders
of
his
comrade
before
the
latter
can
recover
from
his
*NL*
amazement
,
gets
him
on
the
outside
of
the
street
door
,
which
is
*NL*
instantly
slammed
by
the
triumphant
Judy
.
Utterly
confounded
,
Mr.
*NL*
George
awhile
stands
looking
at
the
knocker
.
Mr.
Bagnet
,
in
a
perfect
*NL*
abyss
of
gravity
,
walks
up
and
down
before
the
little
parlour
window
*NL*
like
a
sentry
and
looks
in
every
time
he
passes
,
apparently
revolving
*NL*
something
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Mat
,
''
says
Mr.
George
when
he
has
recovered
himself
,
``
we
must
*NL*
try
the
lawyer

Now
,
what
do
you
think
of
this
rascal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
,
stopping
to
take
a
farewell
look
into
the
parlour
,
*NL*
replies
with
one
shake
of
his
head
directed
at
the
interior
,
``
If
my
*NL*
old
girl
had
been
here
--
I
'd
have
told
him
!
''
Having
so
discharged
*NL*
himself
of
the
subject
of
his
cogitations
,
he
falls
into
step
and
*NL*
marches
off
with
the
trooper
,
shoulder
to
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
present
themselves
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
is
engaged
and
not
to
be
seen
.
He
is
not
at
all
willing
to
see
them
,
*NL*
for
when
they
have
waited
a
full
hour
,
and
the
clerk
,
on
his
bell
*NL*
being
rung
,
takes
the
opportunity
of
mentioning
as
much
,
he
brings
*NL*
forth
no
more
encouraging
message
than
that
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
has
*NL*
nothing
to
say
to
them
and
they
had
better
not
wait
.
They
do
wait
,
*NL*
however
,
with
the
perseverance
of
military
tactics
,
and
at
last
the
*NL*
bell
rings
again
and
the
client
in
possession
comes
out
of
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
client
is
a
handsome
old
lady
,
no
other
than
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
*NL*
housekeeper
at
Chesney
Wold
.
She
comes
out
of
the
sanctuary
with
a
*NL*
fair
old-fashioned
curtsy
and
softly
shuts
the
door
.
She
is
treated
*NL*
with
some
distinction
there
,
for
the
clerk
steps
out
of
his
pew
to
*NL*
show
her
through
the
outer
office
and
to
let
her
out
.
The
old
lady
is
*NL*
thanking
him
for
his
attention
when
she
observes
the
comrades
in
*NL*
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
I
think
those
gentlemen
are
military
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
referring
the
question
to
them
with
his
eye
,
and
Mr.
George
*NL*
not
turning
round
from
the
almanac
over
the
fire-place
.
Mr.
Bagnet
*NL*
takes
upon
himself
to
reply
,
``
Yes

ma'am
.
Formerly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so

I
was

You
'll
excuse

old
woman

I
had
a

once

for

fine
handsome
youth

was

good
in

bold

way

some

did
disparage
him
to

poor

your

troubling
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Same
to
you

returns
Mr.
Bagnet
with
right
good
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
very
touching
in
the
earnestness
of
the
old
lady
's
*NL*
voice
and
in
the
tremble
that
goes
through
her
quaint
old
figure
.
But
*NL*
Mr.
George
is
so
occupied
with
the
almanac
over
the
fire-place
*NL*
-LRB-
calculating
the
coming
months
by
it
perhaps
-RRB-
that
he
does
not
look
*NL*
round
until
she
has
gone
away
and
the
door
is
closed
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George

Mr.
Bagnet
gruffly
whispers
when
he
does
turn
from
the
*NL*
almanac
at
last
.
``
Do

be
cast
down

Why

Cheer
up

*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
having
now
again
gone
in
to
say
that
they
are
still
there
*NL*
and
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
being
heard
to
return
with
some
irascibility
,
*NL*
``
Let

come
in

they
pass
into
the
great
room
with

painted
ceiling

find

standing
before
the
fire

*NL*

within

last
few
minutes
as

his
usual

manner
of
speech

The

sits
down
in

stirs

the
*NL*
creditor
looks
to
his
.
This
is
in
fact
all
but
freeing
him
.
Have
you
*NL*
decided
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
puts
his
hand
into
his
breast
and
answers
with
a
long
*NL*
breath
,
``
I
must
do
it
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
putting
on
his
spectacles
,
sits
down
and
writes
*NL*
the
undertaking
,
which
he
slowly
reads
and
explains
to
Bagnet
,
who
*NL*
has
all
this
time
been
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
who
puts
his
hand
*NL*
on
his
bald
head
again
,
under
this
new
verbal
shower-bath
,
and
seems
*NL*
exceedingly
in
need
of
the
old
girl
through
whom
to
express
his
*NL*
sentiments
.
The
trooper
then
takes
from
his
breast-pocket
a
folded
*NL*
paper
,
which
he
lays
with
an
unwilling
hand
at
the
lawyer
's
elbow
.
*NL*
''
'T
is
only
a
letter
of
instructions
,
sir
.
The
last
I
ever
had
from
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Look
at
a
millstone
,
Mr.
George
,
for
some
change
in
its
expression
,
*NL*
and
you
will
find
it
quite
as
soon
as
in
the
face
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
when
he
opens
and
reads
the
letter
!
He
refolds
it
and
lays
it
in
his
*NL*
desk
with
a
countenance
as
unperturbable
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
has
he
anything
more
to
say
or
do
but
to
nod
once
in
the
same
*NL*
frigid
and
discourteous
manner
and
to
say
briefly
,
``
You
can
go
.
Show
*NL*
these
men
out
,
there
!
''
Being
shown
out
,
they
repair
to
Mr.
Bagnet
's
*NL*
residence
to
dine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boiled
beef
and
greens
constitute
the
day
's
variety
on
the
former
*NL*
repast
of
boiled
pork
and
greens
,
and
Mrs.
Bagnet
serves
out
the
meal
*NL*
in
the
same
way
and
seasons
it
with
the
best
of
temper
,
being
that
*NL*
rare
sort
of
old
girl
that
she
receives
Good
to
her
arms
without
a
*NL*
hint
that
it
might
be
Better
and
catches
light
from
any
little
spot
*NL*
of
darkness
near
her
.
The
spot
on
this
occasion
is
the
darkened
brow
*NL*
of
Mr.
George
;
he
is
unusually
thoughtful
and
depressed
.
At
first
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
trusts
to
the
combined
endearments
of
Quebec
and
Malta
to
*NL*
restore
him
,
but
finding
those
young
ladies
sensible
that
their
*NL*
existing
Bluffy
is
not
the
Bluffy
of
their
usual
frolicsome
*NL*
acquaintance
,
she
winks
off
the
light
infantry
and
leaves
him
to
*NL*
deploy
at
leisure
on
the
open
ground
of
the
domestic
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
does
not
.
He
remains
in
close
order
,
clouded
and
depressed
.
*NL*
During
the
lengthy
cleaning
up
and
pattening
process
,
when
he
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bagnet
are
supplied
with
their
pipes
,
he
is
no
better
than
he
was
at
*NL*
dinner
.
He
forgets
to
smoke
,
looks
at
the
fire
and
ponders
,
lets
his
*NL*
pipe
out
,
fills
the
breast
of
Mr.
Bagnet
with
perturbation
and
dismay
*NL*
by
showing
that
he
has
no
enjoyment
of
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
when
Mrs.
Bagnet
at
last
appears
,
rosy
from
the
*NL*
invigorating
pail
,
and
sits
down
to
her
work
,
Mr.
Bagnet
growls
,
``
Old
*NL*
girl
!
''
and
winks
monitions
to
her
to
find
out
what
's
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
George
!
''
says
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
quietly
threading
her
needle
.
``
How
*NL*
low
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
Not
good
company
?
Well
,
I
am
afraid
I
am
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ai
n't
at
all
like
Bluffy
,
mother
!
''
cries
little
Malta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
ai
n't
well
,
I
think
,
mother
,
''
adds
Quebec
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
that
's
a
bad
sign
not
to
be
like
Bluffy
,
too
!
''
returns
the
*NL*
trooper
,
kissing
the
young
damsels
.
``
But
it
's
true
,
''
with
a
sigh
,
*NL*
``
true
,
I
am
afraid
.
These
little
ones
are
always
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
''
says
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
working
busily
,
``
if
I
thought
you
cross
*NL*
enough
to
think
of
anything
that
a
shrill
old
soldier
's
wife
--
who
*NL*
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
off
afterwards
and
ought
to
have
done
it
*NL*
almost
--
said
this
morning
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
n't
say
to
you
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
kind
soul
of
a
darling
,
''
returns
the
trooper
.
``
Not
a
morsel
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
really
and
truly
,
George
,
what
I
said
and
meant
to
say
was
*NL*
that
I
trusted
Lignum
to
you
and
was
sure
you
'd
bring
him
through
it
.
*NL*
And
you
HAVE
brought
him
through
it
,
noble
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
my
dear

''
says
George
.
``
I
am
glad
of
your
good
opinion

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
giving
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
hand
,
with
her
work
in
it
,
a
friendly
*NL*
shake
--
for
she
took
her
seat
beside
him
--
the
trooper
's
attention
is
*NL*
attracted
to
her
face
.
After
looking
at
it
for
a
little
while
as
she
*NL*
plies
her
needle
,
he
looks
to
young
Woolwich
,
sitting
on
his
stool
in
*NL*
the
corner
,
and
beckons
that
fifer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
there
,
my
boy
,
''
says
George
,
very
gently
smoothing
the
mother
's
*NL*
hair
with
his
hand
,
``
there
's
a
good
loving
forehead
for
you
!
All
*NL*
bright
with
love
of
you
,
my
boy

A
little
touched
by
the
sun
and
the
*NL*
weather
through
following
your
father
about
and
taking
care
of
you
,
*NL*
but
as
fresh
and
wholesome
as
a
ripe
apple
on
a
tree

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
's
face
expresses
,
so
far
as
in
its
wooden
material
lies
,
*NL*
the
highest
approbation
and
acquiescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
will
come
,
my
boy
,
''
pursues
the
trooper
,
``
when
this
hair
of

your

will
be
grey

and
this
forehead
all
crossed

re-crossed
with
wrinkles

and
a
fine
old

she
'll
be
then

Take
*NL*
care

while
you
are
young

that
you
can
think
in

I
never
*NL*
whitened
a
hair

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
concludes
by
rising
from
his
chair
,
seating
the
boy
beside
*NL*
his
mother
in
it
,
and
saying
,
with
something
of
a
hurry
about
him

*NL*
that

'll
smoke
his

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
ill
through
several
weeks
,
and
the
usual
tenor
of
my
life
*NL*
became
like
an
old
remembrance
.
But
this
was
not
the
effect
of
time
*NL*
so
much
as
of
the
change
in
all
my
habits
made
by
the
helplessness
*NL*
and
inaction
of
a
sick-room
.
Before
I
had
been
confined
to
it
many
*NL*
days
,
everything
else
seemed
to
have
retired
into
a
remote
distance
*NL*
where
there
was
little
or
no
separation
between
the
various
stages
of
*NL*
my
life
which
had
been
really
divided
by
years
.
In
falling
ill
,
I
*NL*
seemed
to
have
crossed
a
dark
lake
and
to
have
left
all
my
*NL*
experiences
,
mingled
together
by
the
great
distance
,
on
the
healthy
*NL*
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
housekeeping
duties
,
though
at
first
it
caused
me
great
anxiety
to
*NL*
think
that
they
were
unperformed
,
were
soon
as
far
off
as
the
oldest
*NL*
of
the
old
duties
at
Greenleaf
or
the
summer
afternoons
when
I
went
*NL*
home
from
school
with
my
portfolio
under
my
arm
,
and
my
childish
*NL*
shadow
at
my
side
,
to
my
godmother
's
house
.
I
had
never
known
before
*NL*
how
short
life
really
was
and
into
how
small
a
space
the
mind
could
*NL*
put
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
very
ill
,
the
way
in
which
these
divisions
of
time
became
*NL*
confused
with
one
another
distressed
my
mind
exceedingly
.
At
once
a
*NL*
child
,
an
elder
girl
,
and
the
little
woman
I
had
been
so
happy
as
,
I
*NL*
was
not
only
oppressed
by
cares
and
difficulties
adapted
to
each
*NL*
station
,
but
by
the
great
perplexity
of
endlessly
trying
to
reconcile
*NL*
them
.
I
suppose
that
few
who
have
not
been
in
such
a
condition
can
*NL*
quite
understand
what
I
mean
or
what
painful
unrest
arose
from
this
*NL*
source
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
same
reason
I
am
almost
afraid
to
hint
at
that
time
in
my
*NL*
disorder
--
it
seemed
one
long
night
,
but
I
believe
there
were
both
*NL*
nights
and
days
in
it
--
when
I
laboured
up
colossal
staircases
,
ever
*NL*
striving
to
reach
the
top
,
and
ever
turned
,
as
I
have
seen
a
worm
in
*NL*
a
garden
path
,
by
some
obstruction
,
and
labouring
again
.
I
knew
*NL*
perfectly
at
intervals
,
and
I
think
vaguely
at
most
times
,
that
I
was
*NL*
in
my
bed
;
and
I
talked
with
Charley
,
and
felt
her
touch
,
and
knew
*NL*
her
very
well
;
yet
I
would
find
myself
complaining
,
``
Oh
,
more
of
*NL*
these
never-ending
stairs
,
Charley
--
more
and
more
--
piled
up
to
the
*NL*
sky
'
,
I
think
!
''
and
labouring
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dare
I
hint
at
that
worse
time
when
,
strung
together
somewhere
in
*NL*
great
black
space
,
there
was
a
flaming
necklace
,
or
ring
,
or
starry
*NL*
circle
of
some
kind
,
of
which
I
was
one
of
the
beads
!
And
when
my
*NL*
only
prayer
was
to
be
taken
off
from
the
rest
and
when
it
was
such
*NL*
inexplicable
agony
and
misery
to
be
a
part
of
the
dreadful
thing
?
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
less
I
say
of
these
sick
experiences
,
the
less
tedious
*NL*
and
the
more
intelligible
I
shall
be
.
I
do
not
recall
them
to
make
*NL*
others
unhappy
or
because
I
am
now
the
least
unhappy
in
remembering
*NL*
them
.
It
may
be
that
if
we
knew
more
of
such
strange
afflictions
we
*NL*
might
be
the
better
able
to
alleviate
their
intensity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repose
that
succeeded
,
the
long
delicious
sleep
,
the
blissful
*NL*
rest
,
when
in
my
weakness
I
was
too
calm
to
have
any
care
for
myself
*NL*
and
could
have
heard
-LRB-
or
so
I
think
now
-RRB-
that
I
was
dying
,
with
no
*NL*
other
emotion
than
with
a
pitying
love
for
those
I
left
behind
--
this
*NL*
state
can
be
perhaps
more
widely
understood
.
I
was
in
this
state
when
*NL*
I
first
shrunk
from
the
light
as
it
twinkled
on
me
once
more
,
and
*NL*
knew
with
a
boundless
joy
for
which
no
words
are
rapturous
enough
*NL*
that
I
should
see
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
my
Ada
crying
at
the
door
,
day
and
night
;
I
had
heard
her
*NL*
calling
to
me
that
I
was
cruel
and
did
not
love
her
;
I
had
heard
her
*NL*
praying
and
imploring
to
be
let
in
to
nurse
and
comfort
me
and
to
*NL*
leave
my
bedside
no
more
;
but
I
had
only
said
,
when
I
could
speak
,
*NL*
``
Never
,
my
sweet
girl
,
never
!
''
and
I
had
over
and
over
again
reminded
*NL*
Charley
that
she
was
to
keep
my
darling
from
the
room
whether
I
lived
*NL*
or
died
.
Charley
had
been
true
to
me
in
that
time
of
need
,
and
with
*NL*
her
little
hand
and
her
great
heart
had
kept
the
door
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
my
sight
strengthening
and
the
glorious
light
coming
every
*NL*
day
more
fully
and
brightly
on
me
,
I
could
read
the
letters
that
my
*NL*
dear
wrote
to
me
every
morning
and
evening
and
could
put
them
to
my
*NL*
lips
and
lay
my
cheek
upon
them
with
no
fear
of
hurting
her
.
I
could
*NL*
see
my
little
maid
,
so
tender
and
so
careful
,
going
about
the
two
*NL*
rooms
setting
everything
in
order
and
speaking
cheerfully
to
Ada
from
*NL*
the
open
window
again
.
I
could
understand
the
stillness
in
the
house
*NL*
and
the
thoughtfulness
it
expressed
on
the
part
of
all
those
who
had
*NL*
always
been
so
good
to
me
.
I
could
weep
in
the
exquisite
felicity
of
*NL*
my
heart
and
be
as
happy
in
my
weakness
as
ever
I
had
been
in
my
*NL*
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
my
strength
began
to
be
restored
.
Instead
of
lying
,
with
so
*NL*
strange
a
calmness
,
watching
what
was
done
for
me
,
as
if
it
were
done
*NL*
for
some
one
else
whom
I
was
quietly
sorry
for
,
I
helped
it
a
little
,
*NL*
and
so
on
to
a
little
more
and
much
more
,
until
I
became
useful
to
*NL*
myself
,
and
interested
,
and
attached
to
life
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
well
I
remember
the
pleasant
afternoon
when
I
was
raised
in
bed
*NL*
with
pillows
for
the
first
time
to
enjoy
a
great
tea-drinking
with
*NL*
Charley
!
The
little
creature
--
sent
into
the
world
,
surely
,
to
*NL*
minister
to
the
weak
and
sick
--
was
so
happy
,
and
so
busy
,
and
stopped
*NL*
so
often
in
her
preparations
to
lay
her
head
upon
my
bosom
,
and
*NL*
fondle
me
,
and
cry
with
joyful
tears
she
was
so
glad
,
she
was
so
*NL*
glad
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
say
,
``
Charley
,
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
,
*NL*
I
must
lie
down
again
,
my
darling
,
for
I
am
weaker
than
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
!
''
So
Charley
became
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
took
her
bright
face
*NL*
here
and
there
across
and
across
the
two
rooms
,
out
of
the
shade
into
*NL*
the
divine
sunshine
,
and
out
of
the
sunshine
into
the
shade
,
while
I
*NL*
watched
her
peacefully
.
When
all
her
preparations
were
concluded
and
*NL*
the
pretty
tea-table
with
its
little
delicacies
to
tempt
me
,
and
its
*NL*
white
cloth
,
and
its
flowers
,
and
everything
so
lovingly
and
*NL*
beautifully
arranged
for
me
by
Ada
downstairs
,
was
ready
at
the
*NL*
bedside
,
I
felt
sure
I
was
steady
enough
to
say
something
to
Charley
*NL*
that
was
not
new
to
my
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
I
complimented
Charley
on
the
room
,
and
indeed
it
was
so
fresh
*NL*
and
airy
,
so
spotless
and
neat
,
that
I
could
scarce
believe
I
had
*NL*
been
lying
there
so
long
.
This
delighted
Charley
,
and
her
face
was
*NL*
brighter
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
looking
round
,
``
I
miss
something
,
surely
,
*NL*
that
I
am
accustomed
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
little
Charley
looked
round
too
and
pretended
to
shake
her
head
*NL*
as
if
there
were
nothing
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
pictures
all
as
they
used
to
be
?
''
I
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
one
of
them
,
miss
,
''
said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
furniture
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
where
I
have
moved
it
about
to
make
more
room
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
miss
some
familiar
object
.
Ah
,
I
know
what
it
*NL*
is
,
Charley
!
It
's
the
looking-glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
got
up
from
the
table
,
making
as
if
she
had
forgotten
*NL*
something
,
and
went
into
the
next
room
;
and
I
heard
her
sob
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
thought
of
this
very
often
.
I
was
now
certain
of
it
.
I
could
*NL*
thank
God
that
it
was
not
a
shock
to
me
now
.
I
called
Charley
back
,
*NL*
and
when
she
came
--
at
first
pretending
to
smile
,
but
as
she
drew
*NL*
nearer
to
me
,
looking
grieved
--
I
took
her
in
my
arms
and
said
,
``
It
*NL*
matters
very
little
,
Charley
.
I
hope
I
can
do
without
my
old
face
*NL*
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
presently
so
far
advanced
as
to
be
able
to
sit
up
in
a
great
*NL*
chair
and
even
giddily
to
walk
into
the
adjoining
room
,
leaning
on
*NL*
Charley
.
The
mirror
was
gone
from
its
usual
place
in
that
room
too
,
*NL*
but
what
I
had
to
bear
was
none
the
harder
to
bear
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
had
throughout
been
earnest
to
visit
me
,
and
there
was
*NL*
now
no
good
reason
why
I
should
deny
myself
that
happiness
.
He
came
*NL*
one
morning
,
and
when
he
first
came
in
,
could
only
hold
me
in
his
*NL*
embrace
and
say
,
``
My
dear
,
dear
girl
!
''
I
had
long
known
--
who
could
*NL*
know
better
?
--
what
a
deep
fountain
of
affection
and
generosity
his
*NL*
heart
was
;
and
was
it
not
worth
my
trivial
suffering
and
change
to
*NL*
fill
such
a
place
in
it
?
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
I
thought
.
``
He
has
seen
me
,
and
*NL*
he
loves
me
better
than
he
did
;
he
has
seen
me
and
is
even
fonder
of
*NL*
me
than
he
was
before
;
and
what
have
I
to
mourn
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
by
me
on
the
sofa
,
supporting
me
with
his
arm
.
For
a
*NL*
little
while
he
sat
with
his
hand
over
his
face
,
but
when
he
removed
*NL*
it
,
fell
into
his
usual
manner
.
There
never
can
have
been
,
there
*NL*
never
can
be
,
a
pleasanter
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
woman
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
a
sad
time
this
has
been
.
Such
an
*NL*
inflexible
little
woman
,
too
,
through
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
the
best
,
guardian
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
best
?
''
he
repeated
tenderly
.
``
Of
course
,
for
the
best
.
But
*NL*
here
have
Ada
and
I
been
perfectly
forlorn
and
miserable
;
here
has
*NL*
your
friend
Caddy
been
coming
and
going
late
and
early
;
here
has
*NL*
every
one
about
the
house
been
utterly
lost
and
dejected
;
here
has
*NL*
even
poor
Rick
been
writing
--
to
ME
too
--
in
his
anxiety
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
read
of
Caddy
in
Ada
's
letters
,
but
not
of
Richard
.
I
told
him
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
my
dear
,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
have
thought
it
better
not
to
*NL*
mention
it
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
speak
of
his
writing
to
YOU
,
''
said
I
,
repeating
his
*NL*
emphasis
.
``
As
if
it
were
not
natural
for
him
to
do
so
,
guardian
;
as
*NL*
if
he
could
write
to
a
better
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
he
could
,
my
love
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
``
and
to
many
a
*NL*
better
.
The
truth
is
,
he
wrote
to
me
under
a
sort
of
protest
while
*NL*
unable
to
write
to
you
with
any
hope
of
an
answer
--
wrote
coldly
,
*NL*
haughtily
,
distantly
,
resentfully
.
Well
,
dearest
little
woman
,
we
*NL*
must
look
forbearingly
on
it
.
He
is
not
to
blame
.
Jarndyce
and
*NL*
Jarndyce
has
warped
him
out
of
himself
and
perverted
me
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
I
have
known
it
do
as
bad
deeds
,
and
worse
,
many
a
time
.
If
two
*NL*
angels
could
be
concerned
in
it
,
I
believe
it
would
change
their
*NL*
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
not
changed
yours
,
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
it
has
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
laughingly
.
``
It
has
made
the
*NL*
south
wind
easterly

I
do
n't
know
how
often

Rick
mistrusts
and
*NL*
suspects
me
--
goes
to
lawyers
,
and
is
taught
to
mistrust
and
suspect
*NL*
me
.
Hears
I
have
conflicting
interests
,
claims
clashing
against
his
*NL*
and
what
not

Whereas

heaven
knows
that

I
could
get
out
of
the
*NL*
mountains
of
wiglomeration

my
unfortunate

I
would
rather
restore

be
endowed
with
all
the
money
that
dead
suitors

broken
,
heart
*NL*
and
soul
,
upon
the
wheel
of
Chancery
,
have
left
unclaimed
with
the
*NL*
Accountant-General
--
and
that
's
money
enough
,
my
dear
,
to
be
cast
into
*NL*
a
pyramid
,
in
memory
of
Chancery
's
transcendent
wickedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
IS
it
possible
,
guardian
,
''
I
asked
,
amazed
,
``
that
Richard
can
be
*NL*
suspicious
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
love
,
my
love
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
is
in
the
subtle
poison
of
such
*NL*
abuses
to
breed
such
diseases
.
His
blood
is
infected

and
objects
*NL*
lose
their
natural

in
his
sight

It
is
not
HIS

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

a

misfortune

drawn

the
influences

Jarndyce

I
know
none
greater

By
*NL*
little
and
little
he
has
been
induced

trust
in
that
rotten
reed

*NL*
and
it
communicates
some
portion
of
its
rottenness
to
everything
*NL*
around
him

But
again
I
say
with
all
my
soul
,
we
must
be
patient
with
*NL*
poor
Rick
and
not
blame
him
.
What
a
troop
of
fine
fresh
hearts
like
*NL*
his
have
I
seen
in
my
time
turned
by
the
same
means
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
expressing
something
of
my
wonder
and
regret
that
*NL*
his
benevolent
,
disinterested
intentions
had
prospered
so
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
say
so
,
Dame
Durden
,
''
he
cheerfully
replied
;
``
Ada
is
the
*NL*
happier
,
I
hope
,
and
that
is
much
.
I
did
think
that
I
and
both
these
*NL*
young
creatures
might
be
friends
instead
of
distrustful
foes
and
that
*NL*
we
might
so
far
counter-act
the
suit
and
prove
too
strong
for
it
.
But
*NL*
it
was
too
much
to
expect
.
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
was
the
curtain
of
*NL*
Rick
's
cradle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
guardian
,
may
we
not
hope
that
a
little
experience
will
teach
*NL*
him
what
a
false
and
wretched
thing
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
WILL
hope
so
,
my
Esther
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
and
that
it
may
not
*NL*
teach
him
so
too
late
.
In
any
case
we
must
not
be
hard
on
him
.
There
*NL*
are
not
many
grown
and
matured
men
living
while
we
speak
,
good
men
*NL*
too
,
who
if
they
were
thrown
into
this
same
court
as
suitors
would
*NL*
not
be
vitally
changed
and
depreciated
within
three
years
--
within
*NL*
two
--
within
one
.
How
can
we
stand
amazed
at
poor
Rick
?
A
young
man
so
*NL*
unfortunate
,
''
here
he
fell
into
a
lower
tone
,
as
if
he
were
thinking
*NL*
aloud
,
``
can
not
at
first
believe
-LRB-
who
could
?
-RRB-
that
Chancery
is
what
it
*NL*
is

He
looks
to
it
,
flushed
and
fitfully
,
to
do
something
with
his
*NL*
interests
and
bring
them
to
some
settlement
.
It
procrastinates
,
*NL*
disappoints
,
tries
,
tortures
him
;
wears
out
his
sanguine
hopes
and
*NL*
patience
,
thread
by
thread
;
but
he
still
looks
to
it
,
and
hankers
*NL*
after
it
,
and
finds
his
whole
world
treacherous
and
hollow
.
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
well
!
Enough
of
this
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
supported
me
,
as
at
first
,
all
this
time
,
and
his
tenderness
*NL*
was
so
precious
to
me
that
I
leaned
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
*NL*
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
father
.
I
resolved
in
my
own
mind
in
*NL*
this
little
pause
,
by
some
means
,
to
see
Richard
when
I
grew
strong
*NL*
and
try
to
set
him
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
better
subjects
than
these
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
for
such
a
*NL*
joyful
time
as
the
time
of
our
dear
girl
's
recovery

And
I
had
a
*NL*
commission
to
broach
one
of
them
as
soon
as
I
should
begin
to
talk
.
*NL*
When
shall
Ada
come
to
see
you
,
my
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
thinking
of
that
too
.
A
little
in
connexion
with
the
*NL*
absent
mirrors
,
but
not
much
,
for
I
knew
my
loving
girl
would
be
*NL*
changed
by
no
change
in
my
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
guardian

said
I
,
``
as
I
have
shut
her
out
so
long

indeed

is

me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
well

Dame
Durden

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
good
,
his
touch
expressed
such
endearing
compassion
and
*NL*
affection
,
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
carried
such
comfort
into
my
*NL*
heart
that
I
stopped
for
a
little
while
,
quite
unable
to
go
on
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
,
you
are
tired

said
he
.
``
Rest
a
little

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
have
kept
Ada
out
so
long

I
began
afresh
after
a
short
while
,
*NL*
``
I
think
I
should
like
to
have
my

way
a
little
longer

*NL*
It
would
be
best
to
be
away
from
here
before
I
see
her
.
If
Charley
*NL*
and
I
were
to
go
to
some
country
lodging
as
soon
as
I
can
move
,
and
*NL*
if
I
had
a
week
there
in
which
to
grow
stronger
and
to
be
revived
by
*NL*
the
sweet
air
and
to
look
forward
to
the
happiness
of
having
Ada
with
*NL*
me
again
,
I
think
it
would
be
better
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hope
it
was
not
a
poor
thing
in
me
to
wish
to
be
a
little
more
used
*NL*
to
my
altered
self
before
I
met
the
eyes
of
the
dear
girl
I
longed
so
*NL*
ardently
to
see
,
but
it
is
the
truth
.
I
did
.
He
understood
me
,
I
was
*NL*
sure
;
but
I
was
not
afraid
of
that
.
If
it
were
a
poor
thing
,
I
knew
*NL*
he
would
pass
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
spoilt
little
woman
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
shall
have
her
own
way
*NL*
even
in
her
inflexibility
,
though
at
the
price
,
I
know

of
tears
*NL*
downstairs
.
And
see
here
!
Here
is
Boythorn
,
heart
of
chivalry
,
*NL*
breathing
such
ferocious
vows
as
never
were
breathed
on
paper
before
,
*NL*
that
if
you
do
n't
go
and
occupy
his
whole
house
,
he
having
already
*NL*
turned
out
of
it
expressly
for
that
purpose
,
by
heaven
and
by
earth
*NL*
he
'll
pull
it
down
and
not
leave
one
brick
standing
on
another
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
guardian
put
a
letter
in
my
hand
,
without
any
ordinary
*NL*
beginning
such
as
``
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
''
but
rushing
at
once
into
the
*NL*
words
,
``
I
swear

down

take
*NL*
possession

her
this
day
at
one
*NL*
o'clock
,
P.M.

''
and
then
with
the
utmost
seriousness
,
and
in
the
most
*NL*
emphatic
terms
,
going
on
to
make
the
extraordinary
declaration
he
had
*NL*

We
did
not
appreciate
the
writer
the
less
for
laughing
*NL*
heartily
over
it
,
and
we
settled
that
I
should
send
him
a
letter
of
*NL*
thanks
on
the
morrow
and
accept
his
offer
.
It
was
a
most
agreeable
*NL*
one
to
me
,
for
all
the
places
I
could
have
thought
of
,
I
should
have
*NL*
liked
to
go
to
none
so
well
as
Chesney
Wold
.

*NL*
``
Now
,
little
housewife

''
said
my
guardian
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
``
I
*NL*
was
strictly
timed
before
I
came
upstairs
,
for
you
must
not
be
tired
*NL*
too
soon

and
my
time
has
waned
away
to
the
last
minute

I
have
one
*NL*
other
petition
.
Little
Miss
Flite
,
hearing
a
rumour
that
you
were
*NL*
ill
,
made
nothing
of
walking
down
here
--
twenty
miles
,
poor
soul
,
in
a
*NL*
pair
of
dancing
shoes
--
to
inquire
.
It
was
heaven
's
mercy
we
were
at
*NL*
home
,
or
she
would
have
walked
back
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
old
conspiracy
to
make
me
happy
!
Everybody
seemed
to
be
in
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
pet
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
if
it
would
not
be
irksome
to
you
to
*NL*
admit
the
harmless
little
creature
one
afternoon
before
you
save
*NL*
Boythorn
's
otherwise
devoted
house
from
demolition
,
I
believe
you
*NL*
would
make
her
prouder
and
better
pleased
with
herself
than
I
--
though
*NL*
my
eminent
name
is
Jarndyce
--
could
do
in
a
lifetime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
doubt
he
knew
there
would
be
something
in
the
simple
image
*NL*
of
the
poor
afflicted
creature
that
would
fall
like
a
gentle
lesson
*NL*
on
my
mind
at
that
time
.
I
felt
it
as
he
spoke
to
me
.
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
him
heartily
enough
how
ready
I
was
to
receive
her
.
I
had
always
*NL*
pitied
her
,
never
so
much
as
now
.
I
had
always
been
glad
of
my
little
*NL*
power
to
soothe
her
under
her
calamity
,
but
never
,
never
,
half
so
*NL*
glad
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
arranged
a
time
for
Miss
Flite
to
come
out
by
the
coach
and
share
*NL*
my
early
dinner
.
When
my
guardian
left
me
,
I
turned
my
face
away
upon
*NL*
my
couch
and
prayed
to
be
forgiven
if
I
,
surrounded
by
such
*NL*
blessings
,
had
magnified
to
myself
the
little
trial
that
I
had
to
*NL*
undergo
.
The
childish
prayer
of
that
old
birthday
when
I
had
aspired
*NL*
to
be
industrious
,
contented
,
and
true-hearted
and
to
do
good
to
some
*NL*
one
and
win
some
love
to
myself
if
I
could
came
back
into
my
mind
*NL*
with
a
reproachful
sense
of
all
the
happiness
I
had
since
enjoyed
and
*NL*
all
the
affectionate
hearts
that
had
been
turned
towards
me
.
If
I
*NL*
were
weak
now
,
what
had
I
profited
by
those
mercies
?
I
repeated
the
*NL*
old
childish
prayer
in
its
old
childish
words
and
found
that
its
old
*NL*
peace
had
not
departed
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
now
came
every
day
.
In
a
week
or
so
more
I
could
walk
*NL*
about
our
rooms
and
hold
long
talks
with
Ada
from
behind
the
*NL*
window-curtain
.
Yet
I
never
saw
her
,
for
I
had
not
as
yet
the
courage
*NL*
to
look
at
the
dear
face
,
though
I
could
have
done
so
easily
without
*NL*
her
seeing
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
appointed
day
Miss
Flite
arrived
.
The
poor
little
creature
ran
*NL*
into
my
room
quite
forgetful
of
her
usual
dignity
,
and
crying
from
*NL*
her
very
heart
of
hearts
,
``
My
dear
Fitz
Jarndyce
!
''
fell
upon
my
neck
*NL*
and
kissed
me
twenty
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
she
,
putting
her
hand
into
her
reticule
,
``
I
have
*NL*
nothing
here
but
documents
,
my
dear
Fitz
Jarndyce
;
I
must
borrow
a
*NL*
pocket
handkerchief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
gave
her
one
,
and
the
good
creature
certainly
made
use
of
it
,
*NL*
for
she
held
it
to
her
eyes
with
both
hands
and
sat
so
,
shedding
*NL*
tears
for
the
next
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
,
my
dear
Fitz
Jarndyce
,
''
she
was
careful
to
explain
.
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
pain

Pleasure
to
see
you
well
again

Pleasure
at

the
honour

to
see
you

I
am
so
much
fonder
*NL*
of
you

of
the
Chancellor

Though
I
DO

regularly

the
by

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Flite
here
looked
at
Charley
,
who
had
been
to
meet
her
at
the
*NL*
place
where
the
coach
stopped
.
Charley
glanced
at
me
and
looked
*NL*
unwilling
to
pursue
the
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ve-ry
right
!
''
said
Miss
Flite
,
``
Ve-ry
correct

Truly
!
Highly
*NL*
indiscreet
of
me
to
mention
it
;
but
my

Fitz
Jarndyce
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid

am

said
Miss
Flite
,
touching
her
forehead
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
going
to
tell
me
?
''
said
I
,
smiling
,
for
I
saw
she
*NL*
wanted
to
go
on
.
``
You
have
roused
my
curiosity
,
and
now
you
must
*NL*
gratify
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Flite
looked
at
Charley
for
advice
in
this
important
crisis
,
who
*NL*
said
,
``
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
you
had
better
tell
then
,
''
and
therein
*NL*
gratified
Miss
Flite
beyond
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
sagacious

our
young
friend

''
said
she
to
me
in
her
mysterious
*NL*
way
.
``
Diminutive

But

Well
,
my
dear
,
it
's
a
pretty
*NL*
anecdote

Nothing
more
.
Still
I
think
it
charming
.
Who
should
follow
*NL*
us
down
the
road
from
the
coach
,
my

a
poor
person
in

very
*NL*
ungenteel
bonnet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jenny

said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just

Miss
Flite
acquiesced
with
the
greatest
suavity
.
``
Jenny

*NL*
Ye-es
!
And
what
does
she
tell
our
young
friend

that
there
has
*NL*
been
a
lady
with
a
veil
inquiring
at
her
cottage
after
my
dear
Fitz
*NL*
Jarndyce
's
health
and
taking
a
handkerchief
away
with
her
as
a
little
*NL*
keepsake
merely
because
it
was
my
amiable
Fitz
Jarndyce

!
Now
,
you

prepossessing
in
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

said
Charley
,
to
whom
I
looked
in
some
*NL*
astonishment
,
``
Jenny
says
that
when
her
baby
died

you
left
a

handkerchief
there

put

away
and
kept
it
with
the
*NL*
baby

little
things

I
think
,
if

because
it
was

yours

partly
because
it
had
covered
the
baby

*NL*
*NL*
``
Diminutive

whispered
Miss
Flite
,
making
a
variety
of
motions
about
*NL*
her
own
forehead
to
express
intellect
in
Charley
.
``
But
exceedingly
*NL*
sagacious

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
returned

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Charley
,

took

left
some

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
can
she
be
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love

''
Miss
Flite
suggested
,
advancing
her
lips
to
my
ear
with
*NL*
her
most
mysterious
look
,
``
in
MY
opinion
--
do
n't
mention
this
to
our
*NL*
diminutive
friend

she
's
the
Lord

wife
.
He
's
married
,
*NL*
you
know
.
And
I
understand
she
leads
him
a
terrible
life
.
Throws
his
*NL*
lordship
's
papers
into
the
fire
,
my
dear
,
if
he
wo
n't
pay
the
*NL*
jeweller
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
think
very
much
about
this
lady
then
,
for
I
had
an
*NL*
impression
that
it
might
be
Caddy
.
Besides
,
my
attention
was
diverted
*NL*
by
my
visitor
,
who
was
cold
after
her
ride
and
looked
hungry
and
who
,
*NL*
our
dinner
being
brought
in
,
required
some
little
assistance
in
*NL*
arraying
herself
with
great
satisfaction
in
a
pitiable
old
scarf
and
*NL*
a
much-worn
and
often-mended
pair
of
gloves
,
which
she
had
brought
*NL*
down
in
a
paper
parcel
.
I
had
to
preside
,
too
,
over
the
*NL*
entertainment
,
consisting
of
a
dish
of
fish
,
a
roast
fowl
,
a
*NL*
sweetbread
,
vegetables
,
pudding
,
and
Madeira
;
and
it
was
so
pleasant
*NL*
to
see
how
she
enjoyed
it
,
and
with
what
state
and
ceremony
she
did
*NL*
honour
to
it
,
that
I
was
soon
thinking
of
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
finished
and
had
our
little
dessert
before
us
,
*NL*
embellished
by
the
hands
of
my
dear
,
who
would
yield
the
*NL*
superintendence
of
everything
prepared
for
me
to
no
one
,
Miss
Flite
*NL*
was
so
very
chatty
and
happy
that
I
thought
I
would
lead
her
to
her
*NL*
own
history
,
as
she
was
always
pleased
to
talk
about
herself
.
I
began
*NL*
by
saying
``
You
have
attended
on
the
Lord
Chancellor
many
years
,
Miss
*NL*
Flite
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
many
,
many
,
many
years
,
my
dear
.
But
I
expect
a
judgment
.
*NL*
Shortly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
anxiety
even
in
her
hopefulness
that
made
me
doubtful
if
*NL*
I
had
done
right
in
approaching
the
subject
.
I
thought
I
would
say
no
*NL*
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
expected
a
judgment
,
''
said
Miss
Flite
.
``
My
brother
.
My
*NL*
sister

They
all
expected
a
judgment

The
same
that
I
expect

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es

Dead
of
course
,
my
dear
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
saw
she
would
go
on
,
I
thought
it
best
to
try
to
be
serviceable
*NL*
to
her
by
meeting
the
theme
rather
than
avoiding
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
not
be
wiser
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
expect
this
judgment
no
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
,
''
she
answered
promptly
,
``
of
course
it
would
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
attend
the
court
no
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Equally
of
course
,
''
said
she
.
``
Very
wearing
to
be
always
in
*NL*
expectation
of
what
never
comes

dear
Fitz
Jarndyce
!
Wearing

I
*NL*
assure
you
,
to
the
bone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
slightly
showed
me
her
arm
,
and
it
was
fearfully
thin
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
''
she
went
on
in
her
mysterious
way
,
``
there
's
a
*NL*
dreadful
attraction
in
the
place

Hush
!
Do
n't
mention
it
to
our
*NL*
diminutive
friend
when
she
comes
in
.
Or
it
may
frighten
her
.
With
*NL*
good
reason
.
There
's
a
cruel
attraction
in
the
place
.
You
CA
N'T
leave
*NL*
it
.
And
you
MUST
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
assure
her
that
this
was
not
so
.
She
heard
me
patiently
*NL*
and
smilingly
,
but
was
ready
with
her
own
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
!
You
think
so
because
I
am
a
little
rambling
.
Ve-ry
*NL*
absurd
,
to
be
a
little
rambling
,
is
it
not
?
Ve-ry
confusing
,
too
.
To
*NL*
the
head
.
I
find
it
so
.
But
,
my
dear
,
I
have
been
there
many
years
,
*NL*
and
I
have
noticed
.
It
's
the
mace
and
seal
upon
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
they
do
,
did
she
think
?
I
mildly
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
,
''
returned
Miss
Flite
.
``
Draw
people
on
,
my

Draw
peace
out

of

Sense
out

Good
qualities
*NL*
out

them
even
drawing
my
rest
away
in
the
night

*NL*
Cold
and
glittering
devils

*NL*
*NL*
She
tapped
me
several
times
upon
the
arm
and
nodded
good-humouredly
*NL*
as
if
she
were
anxious
I
should
understand
that
I
had
no
cause
to
*NL*
fear
her
,
though
she
spoke
so
gloomily
,
and
confided
these
awful
*NL*
secrets
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
my
own
case

Before
they
ever
*NL*
drew
me
--
before
I
had
ever
seen
them
--
what
was
it
I
used
to
do
?
*NL*
Tambourine
playing
?
No
.
Tambour
work
.
I
and
my
sister
worked
at
*NL*
tambour
work
.
Our
father
and
our
brother
had
a
builder
's
business
.
*NL*
We
all
lived
together
.
Ve-ry
respectably
,
my
dear
!
First
,
our
father
*NL*
was
drawn
--
slowly
.
Home
was
drawn
with
him
.
In
a
few
years
he
*NL*
was
a
fierce
,
sour
,
angry
bankrupt
without
a
kind
word
or
a
kind
*NL*
look
for
any
one
.
He
had
been
so
different
,
Fitz
Jarndyce
.
He
was
*NL*
drawn
to
a
debtors
'
prison
.
There
he
died
.
Then
our
brother
was
*NL*
drawn
--
swiftly
--
to
drunkenness
.
And
rags
.
And
death
.
Then
my
sister
*NL*
was
drawn
.
Hush
!
Never
ask
to
what
!
Then
I
was
ill
and
in
misery
,
and
*NL*
heard
,
as
I
had
often
heard
before
,
that
this
was
all
the
work
of
*NL*
Chancery
.
When
I
got
better
,
I
went
to
look
at
the
monster
.
And
then
*NL*
I
found
out
how
it
was
,
and
I
was
drawn
to
stay
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
got
over
her
own
short
narrative
,
in
the
delivery
of
which
she
*NL*
had
spoken
in
a
low
,
strained
voice
,
as
if
the
shock
were
fresh
upon
*NL*
her
,
she
gradually
resumed
her
usual
air
of
amiable
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
quite
credit
me
,
my
dear
!
Well
,
well
!
You
will
,
some
day
.
*NL*
I
am
a
little
rambling
.
But
I
have
noticed
.
I
have
seen
many
new
*NL*
faces
come
,
unsuspicious
,
within
the
influence
of
the
mace
and
seal
*NL*
in
these
many
years
.
As
my
father
's
came
there
.
As
my
brother
's
.
As
*NL*
my
sister
's
.
As
my
own
.
I
hear
Conversation
Kenge
and
the
rest
of
*NL*
them
say
to
the
new
faces
,
`
Here
's
little
Miss
Flite
.
Oh
,
you
are
new
*NL*
here
;
and
you
must
come
and
be
presented
to
little
Miss
Flite
!

Ve-ry
*NL*
good
.
Proud
I
am
sure
to
have
the
honour
!
And
we
all
laugh
.
But
,
Fitz
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
I
know
what
will
happen
.
I
know
,
far
better
than
they
do
,
*NL*
when
the
attraction
has
begun
.
I
know
the
signs
,
my
dear
.
I
saw
them
*NL*
begin
in
Gridley
.
And
I
saw
them
end
.
Fitz
Jarndyce
,
my
love
,
''
*NL*
speaking
low
again
,
``
I
saw
them
beginning
in
our
friend
the
ward
in
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
Let
some
one
hold
him
back
.
Or
he
'll
be
drawn
to
ruin

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
in
silence
for
some
moments
,
with
her
face
gradually
*NL*
softening
into
a
smile
.
Seeming
to
fear
that
she
had
been
too
gloomy
,
*NL*
and
seeming
also
to
lose
the
connexion
in
her
mind
,
she
said
politely
*NL*
as
she
sipped
her
glass
of
wine
,
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
as
I
was
saying
,
I
*NL*
expect
a
judgment
shortly
.
Then
I
shall
release
my
birds
,
you
know
,
*NL*
and
confer
estates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
much
impressed
by
her
allusion
to
Richard
and
by
the
sad
*NL*
meaning
,
so
sadly
illustrated
in
her
poor
pinched
form
,
that
made
its
*NL*
way
through
all
her
incoherence
.
But
happily
for
her
,
she
was
quite
*NL*
complacent
again
now
and
beamed
with
nods
and
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
''
she
said
,
gaily
,
reaching
another
hand
to
put
it
upon
*NL*
mine
.
``
You
have
not
congratulated
me
on
my
physician
.
Positively
not
*NL*
once
,
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
confess
that
I
did
not
quite
know
what
she
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
physician
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
my
dear
,
who
was
so
exceedingly
*NL*
attentive
to
me
.
Though
his
services
were
rendered
quite
*NL*
gratuitously
.
Until
the
Day
of
Judgment
.
I
mean
THE
judgment
that
*NL*
will
dissolve
the
spell
upon
me
of
the
mace
and
seal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Woodcourt
is
so
far
away

now

''
said
I
,
``
that
I
thought
the
time

such
congratulation
was
past

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my

she
returned
,
``

it
possible
that
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
has
happened

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
I.

*NL*
``
Not

been
talking

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
True
!
My

for
the
moment

true

I
blame
myself

But
my
memory

has
been
drawn
out
of
me

with
everything
else

by
what
I
mentioned

*NL*
Ve-ry
strong
influence
,
is
it
not

Well
,
my

,
there
has
been
a
*NL*
terrible
shipwreck
over
in
those
East
Indian
seas

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Woodcourt
shipwrecked
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
agitated

my

He
is
safe

An
awful
scene

Death
in
all
*NL*
shapes
.
Hundreds
of
dead
and
dying
.
Fire
,
storm

and
darkness

*NL*
Numbers
of
the
drowning
thrown
upon
a
rock

There
,
and
through
it
*NL*
all
,
my

was
a
hero

Calm

brave

everything

Saved
many

never

buried

off

My

all

worshipped
him

fell
down
at

to

with

it

Stay

Where
's
my
bag
of
documents
?
I
have
got
it
there
,
and
you
*NL*
shall
read
it
,
you
shall
read
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
DID
read
all
the
noble
history
,
though
very
slowly
and
*NL*
imperfectly
then
,
for
my
eyes
were
so
dimmed
that
I
could
not
see
the
*NL*
words
,
and
I
cried
so
much
that
I
was
many
times
obliged
to
lay
down
*NL*
the
long
account
she
had
cut
out
of
the
newspaper
.
I
felt
so
*NL*
triumphant
ever
to
have
known
the
man
who
had
done
such
generous
and
*NL*
gallant
deeds
,
I
felt
such
glowing
exultation
in
his
renown
,
I
so
*NL*
admired
and
loved
what
he
had
done
,
that
I
envied
the
storm-worn
*NL*
people
who
had
fallen
at
his
feet
and
blessed
him
as
their
preserver
.
*NL*
I
could
myself
have
kneeled
down
then
,
so
far
away
,
and
blessed
him
*NL*
in
my
rapture
that
he
should
be
so
truly
good
and
brave
.
I
felt
that
*NL*
no
one
--
mother
,
sister
,
wife
--
could
honour
him
more
than
I.
I
did
,
*NL*
indeed
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
poor
little
visitor
made
me
a
present
of
the
account
,
and
when
as
*NL*
the
evening
began
to
close
in
she
rose
to
take
her
leave
,
lest
she
*NL*
should
miss
the
coach
by
which
she
was
to
return
,
she
was
still
full
*NL*
of
the
shipwreck
,
which
I
had
not
yet
sufficiently
composed
myself
to
*NL*
understand
in
all
its
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
she
as
she
carefully
folded
up
her
scarf
and
gloves
,
*NL*
``
my
brave
physician
ought
to
have
a
title
bestowed
upon
him
.
And
no
*NL*
doubt
he
will
.
You
are
of
that
opinion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
well
deserved
one
,
yes
.
That
he
would
ever
have
one
,
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
Fitz
Jarndyce
?
''
she
asked
rather
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
it
was
not
the
custom
in
England
to
confer
titles
on
men
*NL*
distinguished
by
peaceful
services
,
however
good
and
great
,
unless
*NL*
occasionally
when
they
consisted
of
the
accumulation
of
some
very
*NL*
large
amount
of
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
good
gracious
,
''
said
Miss
Flite
,
``
how
can
you
say
that
?
Surely
*NL*
you
know
,
my
dear
,
that
all
the
greatest
ornaments
of
England
in
*NL*
knowledge
,
imagination
,
active
humanity
,
and
improvement
of
every
*NL*
sort
are
added
to
its
nobility
!
Look
round
you
,
my
dear
,
and
*NL*
consider
.
YOU
must
be
rambling
a
little
now
,
I
think
,
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
that
this
is
the
great
reason
why
titles
will
always
last
in
the
*NL*
land
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
afraid
she
believed
what
she
said
,
for
there
were
moments
when
*NL*
she
was
very
mad
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
must
part
with
the
little
secret
I
have
thus
far
tried
to
*NL*
keep
.
I
had
thought
,
sometimes
,
that
Mr.
Woodcourt
loved
me
and
that
*NL*
if
he
had
been
richer
he
would
perhaps
have
told
me
that
he
loved
me
*NL*
before
he
went
away
.
I
had
thought
,
sometimes
,
that
if
he
had
done
*NL*
so
,
I
should
have
been
glad
of
it
.
But
how
much
better
it
was
now
*NL*
that
this
had
never
happened
!
What
should
I
have
suffered
if
I
had
*NL*
had
to
write
to
him
and
tell
him
that
the
poor
face
he
had
known
as
*NL*
mine
was
quite
gone
from
me
and
that
I
freely
released
him
from
his
*NL*
bondage
to
one
whom
he
had
never
seen
!
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
it
was
so
much
better
as
it
was
!
With
a
great
pang
mercifully
*NL*
spared
me
,
I
could
take
back
to
my
heart
my
childish
prayer
to
be
all
*NL*
he
had
so
brightly
shown
himself
;
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
undone
:
*NL*
no
chain
for
me
to
break
or
for
him
to
drag
;
and
I
could
go
,
please
*NL*
God
,
my
lowly
way
along
the
path
of
duty
,
and
he
could
go
his
nobler
*NL*
way
upon
its
broader
road
;
and
though
we
were
apart
upon
the
journey
,
*NL*
I
might
aspire
to
meet
him
,
unselfishly
,
innocently
,
better
far
than
*NL*
he
had
thought
me
when
I
found
some
favour
in
his
eyes
,
at
the
*NL*
journey
's
end
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
and
I
did
not
set
off
alone
upon
our
expedition
into
*NL*
Lincolnshire
.
My
guardian
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
lose
sight
of
*NL*
me
until
I
was
safe
in
Mr.
Boythorn
's
house
,
so
he
accompanied
us
,
*NL*
and
we
were
two
days
upon
the
road
.
I
found
every
breath
of
air
,
and
*NL*
every
scent
,
and
every
flower
and
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
,
and
every
*NL*
passing
cloud
,
and
everything
in
nature
,
more
beautiful
and
wonderful
*NL*
to
me
than
I
had
ever
found
it
yet
.
This
was
my
first
gain
from
my
*NL*
illness
.
How
little
I
had
lost
,
when
the
wide
world
was
so
full
of
*NL*
delight
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
intending
to
go
back
immediately
,
we
appointed
,
on
our
*NL*
way
down
,
a
day
when
my
dear
girl
should
come
.
I
wrote
her
a
letter
,
*NL*
of
which
he
took
charge
,
and
he
left
us
within
half
an
hour
of
our
*NL*
arrival
at
our
destination
,
on
a
delightful
evening
in
the
early
*NL*
summer-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
good
fairy
had
built
the
house
for
me
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
,
*NL*
and
I
had
been
a
princess
and
her
favoured
god-child
,
I
could
not
*NL*
have
been
more
considered
in
it
.
So
many
preparations
were
made
for
*NL*
me
and
such
an
endearing
remembrance
was
shown
of
all
my
little
*NL*
tastes
and
likings
that
I
could
have
sat
down
,
overcome
,
a
dozen
*NL*
times
before
I
had
revisited
half
the
rooms
.
I
did
better
than
that
,
*NL*
however
,
by
showing
them
all
to
Charley
instead
.
Charley
's
delight
*NL*
calmed
mine
;
and
after
we
had
had
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
Charley
*NL*
had
exhausted
her
whole
vocabulary
of
admiring
expressions
,
I
was
as
*NL*
tranquilly
happy
as
I
ought
to
have
been
.
It
was
a
great
comfort
to
*NL*
be
able
to
say
to
myself
after
tea
,
``
Esther
,
my
dear
,
I
think
you
are
*NL*
quite
sensible
enough
to
sit
down
now
and
write
a
note
of
thanks
to
*NL*
your
host
.
''
He
had
left
a
note
of
welcome
for
me
,
as
sunny
as
his
own
*NL*
face
,
and
had
confided
his
bird
to
my
care
,
which
I
knew
to
be
his
*NL*
highest
mark
of
confidence
.
Accordingly
I
wrote
a
little
note
to
him
*NL*
in
London
,
telling
him
how
all
his
favourite
plants
and
trees
were
*NL*
looking
,
and
how
the
most
astonishing
of
birds
had
chirped
the
*NL*
honours
of
the
house
to
me
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
,
and
how
,
*NL*
after
singing
on
my
shoulder
,
to
the
inconceivable
rapture
of
my
*NL*
little
maid
,
he
was
then
at
roost
in
the
usual
corner
of
his
cage
,
*NL*
but
whether
dreaming
or
no
I
could
not
report
.
My
note
finished
and
*NL*
sent
off
to
the
post
,
I
made
myself
very
busy
in
unpacking
and
*NL*
arranging
;
and
I
sent
Charley
to
bed
in
good
time
and
told
her
I
*NL*
should
want
her
no
more
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
had
not
yet
looked
in
the
glass
and
had
never
asked
to
have
my
*NL*
own
restored
to
me
.
I
knew
this
to
be
a
weakness
which
must
be
*NL*
overcome
,
but
I
had
always
said
to
myself
that
I
would
begin
afresh
*NL*
when
I
got
to
where
I
now
was
.
Therefore
I
had
wanted
to
be
alone
,
*NL*
and
therefore
I
said
,
now
alone
,
in
my
own
room
,
``
Esther
,
if
you
are
*NL*
to
be
happy
,
if
you
are
to
have
any
right
to
pray
to
be
true-hearted
,
*NL*
you
must
keep
your
word
,
my
dear
.
''
I
was
quite
resolved
to
keep
it
,
*NL*
but
I
sat
down
for
a
little
while
first
to
reflect
upon
all
my
*NL*
blessings
.
And
then
I
said
my
prayers
and
thought
a
little
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
hair
had
not
been
cut
off
,
though
it
had
been
in
danger
more
than
*NL*
once
.
It
was
long
and
thick
.
I
let
it
down
,
and
shook
it
out
,
and
*NL*
went
up
to
the
glass
upon
the
dressing-table
.
There
was
a
little
*NL*
muslin
curtain
drawn
across
it
.
I
drew
it
back
and
stood
for
a
moment
*NL*
looking
through
such
a
veil
of
my
own
hair
that
I
could
see
nothing
*NL*
else
.
Then
I
put
my
hair
aside
and
looked
at
the
reflection
in
the
*NL*
mirror
,
encouraged
by
seeing
how
placidly
it
looked
at
me
.
I
was
very
*NL*
much
changed
--
oh
,
very
,
very
much
.
At
first
my
face
was
so
strange
to
*NL*
me
that
I
think
I
should
have
put
my
hands
before
it
and
started
back
*NL*
but
for
the
encouragement
I
have
mentioned
.
Very
soon
it
became
more
*NL*
familiar
,
and
then
I
knew
the
extent
of
the
alteration
in
it
better
*NL*
than
I
had
done
at
first
.
It
was
not
like
what
I
had
expected
,
but
I
*NL*
had
expected
nothing
definite
,
and
I
dare
say
anything
definite
would
*NL*
have
surprised
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
been
a
beauty
and
had
never
thought
myself
one
,
but
I
had
*NL*
been
very
different
from
this
.
It
was
all
gone
now
.
Heaven
was
so
*NL*
good
to
me
that
I
could
let
it
go
with
a
few
not
bitter
tears
and
*NL*
could
stand
there
arranging
my
hair
for
the
night
quite
thankfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
troubled
me
,
and
I
considered
it
for
a
long
time
before
I
*NL*
went
to
sleep
.
I
had
kept
Mr.
Woodcourt
's
flowers
.
When
they
were
*NL*
withered
I
had
dried
them
and
put
them
in
a
book
that
I
was
fond
of
.
*NL*
Nobody
knew
this
,
not
even
Ada
.
I
was
doubtful
whether
I
had
a
right
*NL*
to
preserve
what
he
had
sent
to
one
so
different
--
whether
it
was
*NL*
generous
towards
him
to
do
it
.
I
wished
to
be
generous
to
him
,
even
*NL*
in
the
secret
depths
of
my
heart
,
which
he
would
never
know
,
because
*NL*
I
could
have
loved
him
--
could
have
been
devoted
to
him
.
At
last
I
*NL*
came
to
the
conclusion
that
I
might
keep
them
if
I
treasured
them
*NL*
only
as
a
remembrance
of
what
was
irrevocably
past
and
gone
,
never
to
*NL*
be
looked
back
on
any
more
,
in
any
other
light
.
I
hope
this
may
not
*NL*
seem
trivial
.
I
was
very
much
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
care
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
and
to
be
before
the
glass
*NL*
when
Charley
came
in
on
tiptoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
,
miss
!
''
cried
Charley
,
starting
.
``
Is
that
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
quietly
putting
up
my
hair
.
``
And
I
am
very
*NL*
well
indeed
,
and
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
it
was
a
weight
off
Charley
's
mind
,
but
it
was
a
greater
weight
*NL*
off
mine
.
I
knew
the
worst
now
and
was
composed
to
it
.
I
shall
not
*NL*
conceal
,
as
I
go
on
,
the
weaknesses
I
could
not
quite
conquer
,
but
*NL*
they
always
passed
from
me
soon
and
the
happier
frame
of
mind
stayed
*NL*
by
me
faithfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wishing
to
be
fully
re-established
in
my
strength
and
my
good
spirits
*NL*
before
Ada
came
,
I
now
laid
down
a
little
series
of
plans
with
*NL*
Charley
for
being
in
the
fresh
air
all
day
long
.
We
were
to
be
out
*NL*
before
breakfast
,
and
were
to
dine
early
,
and
were
to
be
out
again
*NL*
before
and
after
dinner
,
and
were
to
talk
in
the
garden
after
tea
,
*NL*
and
were
to
go
to
rest
betimes
,
and
were
to
climb
every
hill
and
*NL*
explore
every
road
,
lane
,
and
field
in
the
neighbourhood
.
As
to
*NL*
restoratives
and
strengthening
delicacies
,
Mr.
Boythorn
's
good
*NL*
housekeeper
was
for
ever
trotting
about
with
something
to
eat
or
*NL*
drink
in
her
hand
;
I
could
not
even
be
heard
of
as
resting
in
the
*NL*
park
but
she
would
come
trotting
after
me
with
a
basket
,
her
cheerful
*NL*
face
shining
with
a
lecture
on
the
importance
of
frequent
*NL*
nourishment
.
Then
there
was
a
pony
expressly
for
my
riding
,
a
chubby
*NL*
pony
with
a
short
neck
and
a
mane
all
over
his
eyes
who
could
*NL*
canter
--
when
he
would
--
so
easily
and
quietly
that
he
was
a
treasure
.
*NL*
In
a
very
few
days
he
would
come
to
me
in
the
paddock
when
I
called
*NL*
him
,
and
eat
out
of
my
hand
,
and
follow
me
about
.
We
arrived
at
such
*NL*
a
capital
understanding
that
when
he
was
jogging
with
me
lazily
,
and
*NL*
rather
obstinately
,
down
some
shady
lane
,
if
I
patted
his
neck
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Stubbs
,
I
am
surprised
you
do
n't
canter
when
you
know
how
much
*NL*
I
like
it
;
and
I
think
you
might
oblige
me
,
for
you
are
only
getting
*NL*
stupid
and
going
to
sleep
,
''
he
would
give
his
head
a
comical
shake
or
*NL*
two
and
set
off
directly
,
while
Charley
would
stand
still
and
laugh
*NL*
with
such
enjoyment
that
her
laughter
was
like
music
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
who
had
given
Stubbs
his
name
,
but
it
seemed
to
belong
to
him
as
*NL*
naturally
as
his
rough
coat
.
Once
we
put
him
in
a
little
chaise
and
*NL*
drove
him
triumphantly
through
the
green
lanes
for
five
miles
;
but
*NL*
all
at
once
,
as
we
were
extolling
him
to
the
skies
,
he
seemed
to
take
*NL*
it
ill
that
he
should
have
been
accompanied
so
far
by
the
circle
of
*NL*
tantalizing
little
gnats
that
had
been
hovering
round
and
round
his
*NL*
ears
the
whole
way
without
appearing
to
advance
an
inch
,
and
stopped
*NL*
to
think
about
it
.
I
suppose
he
came
to
the
decision
that
it
was
not
*NL*
to
be
borne
,
for
he
steadily
refused
to
move
until
I
gave
the
reins
*NL*
to
Charley
and
got
out
and
walked
,
when
he
followed
me
with
a
sturdy
*NL*
sort
of
good
humour
,
putting
his
head
under
my
arm
and
rubbing
his
*NL*
ear
against
my
sleeve
.
It
was
in
vain
for
me
to
say
,
``
Now
,
Stubbs
,
I
*NL*
feel
quite
sure
from
what
I
know
of
you
that
you
will
go
on
if
I
ride
*NL*
a
little
while
,
''
for
the
moment
I
left
him
,
he
stood
stock
still
*NL*
again
.
Consequently
I
was
obliged
to
lead
the
way
,
as
before
;
and
in
*NL*
this
order
we
returned
home
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
and
I
had
reason
to
call
it
the
most
friendly
of
villages
,
I
*NL*
am
sure
,
for
in
a
week
's
time
the
people
were
so
glad
to
see
us
go
*NL*
by
,
though
ever
so
frequently
in
the
course
of
a
day
,
that
there
were
*NL*
faces
of
greeting
in
every
cottage
.
I
had
known
many
of
the
grown
*NL*
people
before
and
almost
all
the
children
,
but
now
the
very
steeple
*NL*
began
to
wear
a
familiar
and
affectionate
look
.
Among
my
new
friends
*NL*
was
an
old
old
woman
who
lived
in
such
a
little
thatched
and
*NL*
whitewashed
dwelling
that
when
the
outside
shutter
was
turned
up
on
*NL*
its
hinges
,
it
shut
up
the
whole
house-front
.
This
old
lady
had
a
*NL*
grandson
who
was
a
sailor
,
and
I
wrote
a
letter
to
him
for
her
and
*NL*
drew
at
the
top
of
it
the
chimney-corner
in
which
she
had
brought
him
*NL*
up
and
where
his
old
stool
yet
occupied
its
old
place
.
This
was
*NL*
considered
by
the
whole
village
the
most
wonderful
achievement
in
the
*NL*
world
,
but
when
an
answer
came
back
all
the
way
from
Plymouth
,
in
*NL*
which
he
mentioned
that
he
was
going
to
take
the
picture
all
the
way
*NL*
to
America
,
and
from
America
would
write
again
,
I
got
all
the
credit
*NL*
that
ought
to
have
been
given
to
the
post-office
and
was
invested
*NL*
with
the
merit
of
the
whole
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
what
with
being
so
much
in
the
air
,
playing
with
so
many
*NL*
children
,
gossiping
with
so
many
people
,
sitting
on
invitation
in
so
*NL*
many
cottages
,
going
on
with
Charley
's
education
,
and
writing
long
*NL*
letters
to
Ada
every
day
,
I
had
scarcely
any
time
to
think
about
that
*NL*
little
loss
of
mine
and
was
almost
always
cheerful
.
If
I
did
think
of
*NL*
it
at
odd
moments
now
and
then
,
I
had
only
to
be
busy
and
forget
it
.
*NL*
I
felt
it
more
than
I
had
hoped
I
should
once
when
a
child
said
,
*NL*
``
Mother
,
why
is
the
lady
not
a
pretty
lady
now
like
she
used
to
be
?
''
*NL*
But
when
I
found
the
child
was
not
less
fond
of
me
,
and
drew
its
soft
*NL*
hand
over
my
face
with
a
kind
of
pitying
protection
in
its
touch
,
*NL*
that
soon
set
me
up
again
.
There
were
many
little
occurrences
which
*NL*
suggested
to
me
,
with
great
consolation
,
how
natural
it
is
to
gentle
*NL*
hearts
to
be
considerate
and
delicate
towards
any
inferiority
.
One
of
*NL*
these
particularly
touched
me
.
I
happened
to
stroll
into
the
little
*NL*
church
when
a
marriage
was
just
concluded
,
and
the
young
couple
had
*NL*
to
sign
the
register
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bridegroom
,
to
whom
the
pen
was
handed
first
,
made
a
rude
cross
*NL*
for
his
mark
;
the
bride
,
who
came
next
,
did
the
same
.
Now
,
I
had
*NL*
known
the
bride
when
I
was
last
there
,
not
only
as
the
prettiest
girl
*NL*
in
the
place
,
but
as
having
quite
distinguished
herself
in
the
*NL*
school
,
and
I
could
not
help
looking
at
her
with
some
surprise
.
She
*NL*
came
aside
and
whispered
to
me
,
while
tears
of
honest
love
and
*NL*
admiration
stood
in
her
bright
eyes
,
``
He
's
a
dear
good
fellow
,
miss
;
*NL*
but
he
ca
n't
write
yet
--
he
's
going
to
learn
of
me
--
and
I
would
n't
*NL*
shame
him
for
the
world
!
''
Why
,
what
had
I
to
fear
,
I
thought
,
when
*NL*
there
was
this
nobility
in
the
soul
of
a
labouring
man
's
daughter
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
blew
as
freshly
and
revivingly
upon
me
as
it
had
ever
blown
,
*NL*
and
the
healthy
colour
came
into
my
new
face
as
it
had
come
into
my
*NL*
old
one
.
Charley
was
wonderful
to
see
,
she
was
so
radiant
and
so
*NL*
rosy
;
and
we
both
enjoyed
the
whole
day
and
slept
soundly
the
whole
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
favourite
spot
of
mine
in
the
park-woods
of
Chesney
Wold
*NL*
where
a
seat
had
been
erected
commanding
a
lovely
view
.
The
wood
had
*NL*
been
cleared
and
opened
to
improve
this
point
of
sight
,
and
the
*NL*
bright
sunny
landscape
beyond
was
so
beautiful
that
I
rested
there
at
*NL*
least
once
every
day
.
A
picturesque
part
of
the
Hall
,
called
the
*NL*
Ghost
's
Walk
,
was
seen
to
advantage
from
this
higher
ground
;
and
the
*NL*
startling
name
,
and
the
old
legend
in
the
Dedlock
family
which
I
had
*NL*
heard
from
Mr.
Boythorn
accounting
for
it
,
mingled
with
the
view
and
*NL*
gave
it
something
of
a
mysterious
interest
in
addition
to
its
real
*NL*
charms
.
There
was
a
bank
here
,
too
,
which
was
a
famous
one
for
*NL*
violets
;
and
as
it
was
a
daily
delight
of
Charley
's
to
gather
wild
*NL*
flowers
,
she
took
as
much
to
the
spot
as
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
idle
to
inquire
now
why
I
never
went
close
to
the
house
*NL*
or
never
went
inside
it
.
The
family
were
not
there
,
I
had
heard
on
my
*NL*
arrival
,
and
were
not
expected
.
I
was
far
from
being
incurious
or
*NL*
uninterested
about
the
building
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
often
sat
in
this
*NL*
place
wondering
how
the
rooms
ranged
and
whether
any
echo
like
a
*NL*
footstep
really
did
resound
at
times
,
as
the
story
said
,
upon
the
*NL*
lonely
Ghost
's
Walk
.
The
indefinable
feeling
with
which
Lady
Dedlock
*NL*
had
impressed
me
may
have
had
some
influence
in
keeping
me
from
the
*NL*
house
even
when
she
was
absent
.
I
am
not
sure
.
Her
face
and
figure
*NL*
were
associated
with
it
,
naturally
;
but
I
can
not
say
that
they
*NL*
repelled
me
from
it
,
though
something
did
.
For
whatever
reason
or
no
*NL*
reason
,
I
had
never
once
gone
near
it
,
down
to
the
day
at
which
my
*NL*
story
now
arrives
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
resting
at
my
favourite
point
after
a
long
ramble
,
and
Charley
*NL*
was
gathering
violets
at
a
little
distance
from
me
.
I
had
been
*NL*
looking
at
the
Ghost
's
Walk
lying
in
a
deep
shade
of
masonry
afar
off
*NL*
and
picturing
to
myself
the
female
shape
that
was
said
to
haunt
it
*NL*
when
I
became
aware
of
a
figure
approaching
through
the
wood
.
The
*NL*
perspective
was
so
long
and
so
darkened
by
leaves
,
and
the
shadows
of
*NL*
the
branches
on
the
ground
made
it
so
much
more
intricate
to
the
eye
,
*NL*
that
at
first
I
could
not
discern
what
figure
it
was
.
By
little
and
*NL*
little
it
revealed
itself
to
be
a
woman
's
--
a
lady
's
--
Lady
Dedlock
's
.
*NL*
She
was
alone
and
coming
to
where
I
sat
with
a
much
quicker
step
,
I
*NL*
observed
to
my
surprise
,
than
was
usual
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
fluttered
by
her
being
unexpectedly
so
near
-LRB-
she
was
almost
*NL*
within
speaking
distance
before
I
knew
her
-RRB-
and
would
have
risen
to
*NL*
continue
my
walk
.
But
I
could
not
.
I
was
rendered
motionless
.
Not
so
*NL*
much
by
her
hurried
gesture
of
entreaty
,
not
so
much
by
her
quick
*NL*
advance
and
outstretched
hands
,
not
so
much
by
the
great
change
in
*NL*
her
manner
and
the
absence
of
her
haughty
self-restraint
,
as
by
a
*NL*
something
in
her
face
that
I
had
pined
for
and
dreamed
of
when
I
was
*NL*
a
little
child
,
something
I
had
never
seen
in
any
face
,
something
I
*NL*
had
never
seen
in
hers
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dread
and
faintness
fell
upon
me
,
and
I
called
to
Charley
.
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
stopped
upon
the
instant
and
changed
back
almost
to
what
I
*NL*
had
known
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
I
am
afraid
I
have
startled
you
,
''
she
said
,
now
*NL*
advancing
slowly
.
``
You
can
scarcely
be
strong
yet
.
You
have
been
very
*NL*
ill
,
I
know
.
I
have
been
much
concerned
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
no
more
have
removed
my
eyes
from
her
pale
face
than
I
could
*NL*
have
stirred
from
the
bench
on
which
I
sat
.
She
gave
me
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
its
deadly
coldness
,
so
at
variance
with
the
enforced
composure
of
*NL*
her
features
,
deepened
the
fascination
that
overpowered
me
.
I
can
not
*NL*
say
what
was
in
my
whirling
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
recovering
again
?
''
she
asked
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
quite
well
but
a
moment
ago
,
Lady
Dedlock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
your
young
attendant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
send
her
on
before
and
walk
towards
your
house
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
``
take
your
flowers
home
,
and
I
will
follow
you
*NL*
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
,
with
her
best
curtsy
,
blushingly
tied
on
her
bonnet
and
went
*NL*
her
way
.
When
she
was
gone
,
Lady
Dedlock
sat
down
on
the
seat
beside
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
tell
in
any
words
what
the
state
of
my
mind
was
when
I
saw
*NL*
in
her
hand
my
handkerchief
with
which
I
had
covered
the
dead
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
her
,
but
I
could
not
see
her
,
I
could
not
hear
her
,
I
*NL*
could
not
draw
my
breath
.
The
beating
of
my
heart
was
so
violent
and
*NL*
wild
that
I
felt
as
if
my
life
were
breaking
from
me
.
But
when
she
*NL*
caught
me
to
her
breast
,
kissed
me
,
wept
over
me
,
compassionated
me
,
*NL*
and
called
me
back
to
myself
;
when
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
*NL*
cried
to
me
,
``
Oh
,
my
child
,
my
child
,
I
am
your
wicked
and
unhappy
*NL*
mother
!
Oh
,
try
to
forgive
me
!
''
--
when
I
saw
her
at
my
feet
on
the
*NL*
bare
earth
in
her
great
agony
of
mind
,
I
felt
,
through
all
my
tumult
*NL*
of
emotion
,
a
burst
of
gratitude
to
the
providence
of
God
that
I
was
*NL*
so
changed
as
that
I
never
could
disgrace
her
by
any
trace
of
*NL*
likeness
,
as
that
nobody
could
ever
now
look
at
me
and
look
at
her
*NL*
and
remotely
think
of
any
near
tie
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
raised
my
mother
up
,
praying
and
beseeching
her
not
to
stoop
before
*NL*
me
in
such
affliction
and
humiliation
.
I
did
so
in
broken
,
incoherent
*NL*
words
,
for
besides
the
trouble
I
was
in
,
it
frightened
me
to
see
her
*NL*
at
MY
feet
.
I
told
her
--
or
I
tried
to
tell
her
--
that
if
it
were
for
*NL*
me
,
her
child
,
under
any
circumstances
to
take
upon
me
to
forgive
*NL*
her
,
I
did
it
,
and
had
done
it
,
many
,
many
years
.
I
told
her
that
my
*NL*
heart
overflowed
with
love
for
her
,
that
it
was
natural
love
which
*NL*
nothing
in
the
past
had
changed
or
could
change
.
That
it
was
not
for
*NL*
me
,
then
resting
for
the
first
time
on
my
mother
's
bosom
,
to
take
her
*NL*
to
account
for
having
given
me
life
,
but
that
my
duty
was
to
bless
*NL*
her
and
receive
her
,
though
the
whole
world
turned
from
her
,
and
that
*NL*
I
only
asked
her
leave
to
do
it
.
I
held
my
mother
in
my
embrace
,
and
*NL*
she
held
me
in
hers
,
and
among
the
still
woods
in
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
summer
day
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
our
two
troubled
minds
that
*NL*
was
not
at
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
bless
and
receive
me
,
''
groaned
my
mother
,
``
it
is
far
too
late
.
I
*NL*
must
travel
my
dark
road
alone
,
and
it
will
lead
me
where
it
will
.
*NL*
From
day
to
day
,
sometimes
from
hour
to
hour
,
I
do
not
see
the
way
*NL*
before
my
guilty
feet
.
This
is
the
earthly
punishment
I
have
brought
*NL*
upon
myself
.
I
bear
it
,
and
I
hide
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
thinking
of
her
endurance
,
she
drew
her
habitual
air
of
*NL*
proud
indifference
about
her
like
a
veil
,
though
she
soon
cast
it
off
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
keep
this
secret
,
if
by
any
means
it
can
be
kept
,
not
wholly
*NL*
for
myself
.
I
have
a
husband
,
wretched
and
dishonouring
creature
that
*NL*
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
she
uttered
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
despair
,
more
*NL*
terrible
in
its
sound
than
any
shriek
.
Covering
her
face
with
her
*NL*
hands
,
she
shrank
down
in
my
embrace
as
if
she
were
unwilling
that
I
*NL*
should
touch
her
;
nor
could
I
,
by
my
utmost
persuasions
or
by
any
*NL*
endearments
I
could
use
,
prevail
upon
her
to
rise
.
She
said
,
no
,
no
,
*NL*
no
,
she
could
only
speak
to
me
so
;
she
must
be
proud
and
disdainful
*NL*
everywhere
else
;
she
would
be
humbled
and
ashamed
there
,
in
the
only
*NL*
natural
moments
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
unhappy
mother
told
me
that
in
my
illness
she
had
been
nearly
*NL*
frantic
.
She
had
but
then
known
that
her
child
was
living
.
She
could
*NL*
not
have
suspected
me
to
be
that
child
before
.
She
had
followed
me
*NL*
down
here
to
speak
to
me
but
once
in
all
her
life
.
We
never
could
*NL*
associate
,
never
could
communicate
,
never
probably
from
that
time
*NL*
forth
could
interchange
another
word
on
earth
.
She
put
into
my
hands
*NL*
a
letter
she
had
written
for
my
reading
only
and
said
when
I
had
read
*NL*
it
and
destroyed
it
--
but
not
so
much
for
her
sake
,
since
she
asked
*NL*
nothing
,
as
for
her
husband
's
and
my
own
--
I
must
evermore
consider
*NL*
her
as
dead
.
If
I
could
believe
that
she
loved
me
,
in
this
agony
in
*NL*
which
I
saw
her
,
with
a
mother
's
love
,
she
asked
me
to
do
that
,
for
*NL*
then
I
might
think
of
her
with
a
greater
pity
,
imagining
what
she
*NL*
suffered
.
She
had
put
herself
beyond
all
hope
and
beyond
all
help
.
*NL*
Whether
she
preserved
her
secret
until
death
or
it
came
to
be
*NL*
discovered
and
she
brought
dishonour
and
disgrace
upon
the
name
she
*NL*
had
taken
,
it
was
her
solitary
struggle
always
;
and
no
affection
*NL*
could
come
near
her
,
and
no
human
creature
could
render
her
any
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
the
secret
safe
so
far
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Is
it
safe
now
,
dearest
*NL*
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
my
mother
.
``
It
has
been
very
near
discovery
.
It
was
*NL*
saved
by
an
accident
.
It
may
be
lost
by
another
accident
--
to-morrow
,
*NL*
any
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
dread
a
particular
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
Do
not
tremble
and
cry
so
much
for
me

I
am
not
worthy

these
tears

said
my
mother
,
kissing
my
hands
.
``
I
dread
one
person
*NL*
very
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
An
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
friend

One
who
is

passionless

He
is
Sir

Leicester

lawyer
,
mechanically
faithful
without
attachment

very
jealous

alarmed

near

``
He

none

indifferent

his

calling

His
calling
is
the
acquisition
of
secrets
and
the
holding

possession
of
such
power
as
they
give
him
,
with
no
sharer

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Could

``
Dear

resolved

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jarndyce

''
I
was
beginning
when
my
mother
hurriedly
inquired
,
*NL*
``
Does
HE
suspect
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
I.
``
No

indeed

Be
assured

And
I
told
*NL*
her
what
he
had
related
to
me
as
his
knowledge
of
my
story
.
``
But
he
*NL*
is
so
good
and
sensible

said
I
,
``
that
perhaps
if
he
knew

*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
,
who
until
this
time
had
made
no
change
in
her
position

*NL*
raised
her
hand
up
to
my
lips
and
stopped
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confide
fully
in

she
said
after
a
little
while
.
``
You
have
my
*NL*
free
consent

a
small
gift
from
such
a
mother
to
her
injured
*NL*
child

--
but
do
not
tell
me
of
it
.
Some
pride
is
left
in
me
even
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
,
as
nearly
as
I
could
then
,
or
can
recall
now
--
for
my
*NL*
agitation
and
distress
throughout
were
so
great
that
I
scarcely
*NL*
understood
myself
,
though
every
word
that
was
uttered
in
the
mother
's
*NL*
voice
,
so
unfamiliar
and
so
melancholy
to
me
,
which
in
my
childhood
I
*NL*
had
never
learned
to
love
and
recognize
,
had
never
been
sung
to
sleep
*NL*
with
,
had
never
heard
a
blessing
from
,
had
never
had
a
hope
inspired
*NL*
by
,
made
an
enduring
impression
on
my
memory
--
I
say
I
explained
,
or
*NL*
tried
to
do
it
,
how
I
had
only
hoped
that
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
who
had
been
*NL*
the
best
of
fathers
to
me
,
might
be
able
to
afford
some
counsel
and
*NL*
support
to
her
.
But
my
mother
answered
no
,
it
was
impossible
;
no
one
*NL*
could
help
her
.
Through
the
desert
that
lay
before
her
,
she
must
go
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
my
child
!
''
she
said
.
``
For
the
last
time
!
These
kisses
for
*NL*
the
last
time
!
These
arms
upon
my
neck
for
the
last
time
!
We
shall
*NL*
meet
no
more
.
To
hope
to
do
what
I
seek
to
do
,
I
must
be
what
I
have
*NL*
been
so
long
.
Such
is
my
reward
and
doom
.
If
you
hear
of
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
,
brilliant
,
prosperous
,
and
flattered
,
think
of
your
wretched
*NL*
mother
,
conscience-stricken
,
underneath
that
mask
!
Think
that
the
*NL*
reality
is
in
her
suffering
,
in
her
useless
remorse
,
in
her
murdering
*NL*
within
her
breast
the
only
love
and
truth
of
which
it
is
capable
!
And
*NL*
then
forgive
her
if
you
can
,
and
cry
to
heaven
to
forgive
her
,
which
*NL*
it
never
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
held
one
another
for
a
little
space
yet
,
but
she
was
so
firm
that
*NL*
she
took
my
hands
away
,
and
put
them
back
against
my
breast
,
and
with
*NL*
a
last
kiss
as
she
held
them
there
,
released
them
,
and
went
from
me
*NL*
into
the
wood
.
I
was
alone
,
and
calm
and
quiet
below
me
in
the
sun
*NL*
and
shade
lay
the
old
house
,
with
its
terraces
and
turrets
,
on
which
*NL*
there
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
such
complete
repose
when
I
first
saw
*NL*
it
,
but
which
now
looked
like
the
obdurate
and
unpitying
watcher
of
*NL*
my
mother
's
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stunned
as
I
was
,
as
weak
and
helpless
at
first
as
I
had
ever
been
in
*NL*
my
sick
chamber
,
the
necessity
of
guarding
against
the
danger
of
*NL*
discovery
,
or
even
of
the
remotest
suspicion
,
did
me
service
.
I
took
*NL*
such
precautions
as
I
could
to
hide
from
Charley
that
I
had
been
*NL*
crying
,
and
I
constrained
myself
to
think
of
every
sacred
obligation
*NL*
that
there
was
upon
me
to
be
careful
and
collected
.
It
was
not
a
*NL*
little
while
before
I
could
succeed
or
could
even
restrain
bursts
of
*NL*
grief
,
but
after
an
hour
or
so
I
was
better
and
felt
that
I
might
*NL*
return
.
I
went
home
very
slowly
and
told
Charley
,
whom
I
found
at
the
*NL*
gate
looking
for
me
,
that
I
had
been
tempted
to
extend
my
walk
after
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
had
left
me
and
that
I
was
over-tired
and
would
lie
*NL*
down
.
Safe
in
my
own
room
,
I
read
the
letter
.
I
clearly
derived
from
*NL*
it
--
and
that
was
much
then
--
that
I
had
not
been
abandoned
by
my
*NL*
mother
.
Her
elder
and
only
sister
,
the
godmother
of
my
childhood
,
*NL*
discovering
signs
of
life
in
me
when
I
had
been
laid
aside
as
dead
,
*NL*
had
in
her
stern
sense
of
duty
,
with
no
desire
or
willingness
that
I
*NL*
should
live
,
reared
me
in
rigid
secrecy
and
had
never
again
beheld
my
*NL*
mother
's
face
from
within
a
few
hours
of
my
birth
.
So
strangely
did
I
*NL*
hold
my
place
in
this
world
that
until
within
a
short
time
back
I
had
*NL*
never
,
to
my
own
mother
's
knowledge
,
breathed
--
had
been
buried
--
had
*NL*
never
been
endowed
with
life
--
had
never
borne
a
name
.
When
she
had
*NL*
first
seen
me
in
the
church
she
had
been
startled
and
had
thought
of
*NL*
what
would
have
been
like
me
if
it
had
ever
lived
,
and
had
lived
on
,
*NL*
but
that
was
all
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
more
the
letter
told
me
needs
not
to
be
repeated
here
.
It
has
*NL*
its
own
times
and
places
in
my
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
care
was
to
burn
what
my
mother
had
written
and
to
consume
*NL*
even
its
ashes
.
I
hope
it
may
not
appear
very
unnatural
or
bad
in
me
*NL*
that
I
then
became
heavily
sorrowful
to
think
I
had
ever
been
reared
.
*NL*
That
I
felt
as
if
I
knew
it
would
have
been
better
and
happier
for
*NL*
many
people
if
indeed
I
had
never
breathed
.
That
I
had
a
terror
of
*NL*
myself
as
the
danger
and
the
possible
disgrace
of
my
own
mother
and
*NL*
of
a
proud
family
name
.
That
I
was
so
confused
and
shaken
as
to
be
*NL*
possessed
by
a
belief
that
it
was
right
and
had
been
intended
that
I
*NL*
should
die
in
my
birth
,
and
that
it
was
wrong
and
not
intended
that
I
*NL*
should
be
then
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
the
real
feelings
that
I
had
.
I
fell
asleep
worn
out
,
and
*NL*
when
I
awoke
I
cried
afresh
to
think
that
I
was
back
in
the
world
*NL*
with
my
load
of
trouble
for
others
.
I
was
more
than
ever
frightened
*NL*
of
myself
,
thinking
anew
of
her
against
whom
I
was
a
witness
,
of
the
*NL*
owner
of
Chesney
Wold
,
of
the
new
and
terrible
meaning
of
the
old
*NL*
words
now
moaning
in
my
ear
like
a
surge
upon
the
shore
,
``
Your
*NL*
mother
,
Esther
,
was
your
disgrace
,
and
you
are
hers
.
The
time
will
*NL*
come
--
and
soon
enough
--
when
you
will
understand
this
better
,
and
will
*NL*
feel
it
too
,
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
.
''
With
them
,
those
other
*NL*
words
returned
,
``
Pray
daily
that
the
sins
of
others
be
not
visited
*NL*
upon
your
head
.
''
I
could
not
disentangle
all
that
was
about
me
,
and
I
*NL*
felt
as
if
the
blame
and
the
shame
were
all
in
me
,
and
the
visitation
*NL*
had
come
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
waned
into
a
gloomy
evening
,
overcast
and
sad
,
and
I
still
*NL*
contended
with
the
same
distress
.
I
went
out
alone
,
and
after
walking
*NL*
a
little
in
the
park
,
watching
the
dark
shades
falling
on
the
trees
*NL*
and
the
fitful
flight
of
the
bats
,
which
sometimes
almost
touched
me
,
*NL*
was
attracted
to
the
house
for
the
first
time
.
Perhaps
I
might
not
*NL*
have
gone
near
it
if
I
had
been
in
a
stronger
frame
of
mind
.
As
it
*NL*
was
,
I
took
the
path
that
led
close
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
dare
to
linger
or
to
look
up
,
but
I
passed
before
the
*NL*
terrace
garden
with
its
fragrant
odours
,
and
its
broad
walks
,
and
its
*NL*
well-kept
beds
and
smooth
turf
;
and
I
saw
how
beautiful
and
grave
it
*NL*
was
,
and
how
the
old
stone
balustrades
and
parapets
,
and
wide
flights
*NL*
of
shallow
steps
,
were
seamed
by
time
and
weather
;
and
how
the
*NL*
trained
moss
and
ivy
grew
about
them
,
and
around
the
old
stone
*NL*
pedestal
of
the
sun-dial
;
and
I
heard
the
fountain
falling
.
Then
the
*NL*
way
went
by
long
lines
of
dark
windows
diversified
by
turreted
towers
*NL*
and
porches
of
eccentric
shapes
,
where
old
stone
lions
and
grotesque
*NL*
monsters
bristled
outside
dens
of
shadow
and
snarled
at
the
evening
*NL*
gloom
over
the
escutcheons
they
held
in
their
grip
.
Thence
the
path
*NL*
wound
underneath
a
gateway
,
and
through
a
court-yard
where
the
*NL*
principal
entrance
was
-LRB-
I
hurried
quickly
on
-RRB-
,
and
by
the
stables
*NL*
where
none
but
deep
voices
seemed
to
be
,
whether
in
the
murmuring
of
*NL*
the
wind
through
the
strong
mass
of
ivy
holding
to
a
high
red
wall
,
*NL*
or
in
the
low
complaining
of
the
weathercock
,
or
in
the
barking
of
*NL*
the
dogs
,
or
in
the
slow
striking
of
a
clock
.
So
,
encountering
*NL*
presently
a
sweet
smell
of
limes
,
whose
rustling
I
could
hear
,
I
*NL*
turned
with
the
turning
of
the
path
to
the
south
front
,
and
there
*NL*
above
me
were
the
balustrades
of
the
Ghost
's
Walk
and
one
lighted
*NL*
window
that
might
be
my
mother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
was
paved
here
,
like
the
terrace
overhead
,
and
my
footsteps
*NL*
from
being
noiseless
made
an
echoing
sound
upon
the
flags
.
Stopping
*NL*
to
look
at
nothing
,
but
seeing
all
I
did
see
as
I
went
,
I
was
passing
*NL*
quickly
on
,
and
in
a
few
moments
should
have
passed
the
lighted
*NL*
window
,
when
my
echoing
footsteps
brought
it
suddenly
into
my
mind
*NL*
that
there
was
a
dreadful
truth
in
the
legend
of
the
Ghost
's
Walk
,
*NL*
that
it
was
I
who
was
to
bring
calamity
upon
the
stately
house
and
*NL*
that
my
warning
feet
were
haunting
it
even
then
.
Seized
with
an
*NL*
augmented
terror
of
myself
which
turned
me
cold
,
I
ran
from
myself
*NL*
and
everything
,
retraced
the
way
by
which
I
had
come
,
and
never
*NL*
paused
until
I
had
gained
the
lodge-gate
,
and
the
park
lay
sullen
and
*NL*
black
behind
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
before
I
was
alone
in
my
own
room
for
the
night
and
had
again
*NL*
been
dejected
and
unhappy
there
did
I
begin
to
know
how
wrong
and
*NL*
thankless
this
state
was
.
But
from
my
darling
who
was
coming
on
the
*NL*
morrow
,
I
found
a
joyful
letter
,
full
of
such
loving
anticipation
*NL*
that
I
must
have
been
of
marble
if
it
had
not
moved
me
;
from
my
*NL*
guardian
,
too
,
I
found
another
letter
,
asking
me
to
tell
Dame
Durden
,
*NL*
if
I
should
see
that
little
woman
anywhere
,
that
they
had
moped
most
*NL*
pitiably
without
her
,
that
the
housekeeping
was
going
to
rack
and
*NL*
ruin
,
that
nobody
else
could
manage
the
keys
,
and
that
everybody
in
*NL*
and
about
the
house
declared
it
was
not
the
same
house
and
was
*NL*
becoming
rebellious
for
her
return
.
Two
such
letters
together
made
me
*NL*
think
how
far
beyond
my
deserts
I
was
beloved
and
how
happy
I
ought
*NL*
to
be
.
That
made
me
think
of
all
my
past
life
;
and
that
brought
me
,
*NL*
as
it
ought
to
have
done
before
,
into
a
better
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
saw
very
well
that
I
could
not
have
been
intended
to
die
,
or
I
*NL*
should
never
have
lived
;
not
to
say
should
never
have
been
reserved
*NL*
for
such
a
happy
life
.
I
saw
very
well
how
many
things
had
worked
*NL*
together
for
my
welfare
,
and
that
if
the
sins
of
the
fathers
were
*NL*
sometimes
visited
upon
the
children
,
the
phrase
did
not
mean
what
I
*NL*
had
in
the
morning
feared
it
meant
.
I
knew
I
was
as
innocent
of
my
*NL*
birth
as
a
queen
of
hers
and
that
before
my
Heavenly
Father
I
should
*NL*
not
be
punished
for
birth
nor
a
queen
rewarded
for
it
.
I
had
had
*NL*
experience
,
in
the
shock
of
that
very
day
,
that
I
could
,
even
thus
*NL*
soon
,
find
comforting
reconcilements
to
the
change
that
had
fallen
on
*NL*
me
.
I
renewed
my
resolutions
and
prayed
to
be
strengthened
in
them
,
*NL*
pouring
out
my
heart
for
myself
and
for
my
unhappy
mother
and
feeling
*NL*
that
the
darkness
of
the
morning
was
passing
away
.
It
was
not
upon
my
*NL*
sleep
;
and
when
the
next
day
's
light
awoke
me
,
it
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
girl
was
to
arrive
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
How
to
*NL*
help
myself
through
the
intermediate
time
better
than
by
taking
a
*NL*
long
walk
along
the
road
by
which
she
was
to
come
,
I
did
not
know
;
so
*NL*
Charley
and
I
and
Stubbs
--
Stubbs
saddled
,
for
we
never
drove
him
*NL*
after
the
one
great
occasion
--
made
a
long
expedition
along
that
road
*NL*
and
back
.
On
our
return
,
we
held
a
great
review
of
the
house
and
*NL*
garden
and
saw
that
everything
was
in
its
prettiest
condition
,
and
*NL*
had
the
bird
out
ready
as
an
important
part
of
the
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
more
than
two
full
hours
yet
to
elapse
before
she
could
*NL*
come
,
and
in
that
interval
,
which
seemed
a
long
one
,
I
must
confess
I
*NL*
was
nervously
anxious
about
my
altered
looks
.
I
loved
my
darling
so
*NL*
well
that
I
was
more
concerned
for
their
effect
on
her
than
on
any
*NL*
one
.
I
was
not
in
this
slight
distress
because
I
at
all
repined
--
I
am
*NL*
quite
certain
I
did
not
,
that
day
--
but
,
I
thought
,
would
she
be
*NL*
wholly
prepared
?
When
she
first
saw
me
,
might
she
not
be
a
little
*NL*
shocked
and
disappointed
?
Might
it
not
prove
a
little
worse
than
she
*NL*
expected
?
Might
she
not
look
for
her
old
Esther
and
not
find
her
?
*NL*
Might
she
not
have
to
grow
used
to
me
and
to
begin
all
over
again
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
the
various
expressions
of
my
sweet
girl
's
face
so
well
,
and
*NL*
it
was
such
an
honest
face
in
its
loveliness
,
that
I
was
sure
*NL*
beforehand
she
could
not
hide
that
first
look
from
me
.
And
I
*NL*
considered
whether
,
if
it
should
signify
any
one
of
these
meanings
,
*NL*
which
was
so
very
likely
,
could
I
quite
answer
for
myself
?
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
thought
I
could
.
After
last
night
,
I
thought
I
could
.
But
to
*NL*
wait
and
wait
,
and
expect
and
expect
,
and
think
and
think
,
was
such
*NL*
bad
preparation
that
I
resolved
to
go
along
the
road
again
and
meet
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
said
to
Charley
,
``
Charley
,
I
will
go
by
myself
and
walk
along
*NL*
the
road
until
she
comes
.
''
Charley
highly
approving
of
anything
that
*NL*
pleased
me
,
I
went
and
left
her
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
I
got
to
the
second
milestone
,
I
had
been
in
so
many
*NL*
palpitations
from
seeing
dust
in
the
distance
-LRB-
though
I
knew
it
was
*NL*
not
,
and
could
not
,
be
the
coach
yet
-RRB-
that
I
resolved
to
turn
back
*NL*
and
go
home
again
.
And
when
I
had
turned
,
I
was
in
such
fear
of
the
*NL*
coach
coming
up
behind
me
-LRB-
though
I
still
knew
that
it
neither
would
,
*NL*
nor
could
,
do
any
such
thing
-RRB-
that
I
ran
the
greater
part
of
the
way
*NL*
to
avoid
being
overtaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
I
considered
,
when
I
had
got
safe
back
again
,
this
was
a
nice
*NL*
thing
to
have
done
!
Now
I
was
hot
and
had
made
the
worst
of
it
*NL*
instead
of
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
when
I
believed
there
was
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
*NL*
yet
,
Charley
all
at
once
cried
out
to
me
as
I
was
trembling
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
``
Here
she
comes
,
miss
!
Here
she
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
mean
to
do
it
,
but
I
ran
upstairs
into
my
room
and
hid
*NL*
myself
behind
the
door
.
There
I
stood
trembling
,
even
when
I
heard
my
*NL*
darling
calling
as
she
came
upstairs
,
``
Esther
,
my
dear
,
my
love
,
*NL*
where
are
you
?
Little
woman
,
dear
Dame
Durden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
in
,
and
was
running
out
again
when
she
saw
me
.
Ah
,
my
angel
*NL*
girl
!
The
old
dear
look
,
all
love
,
all
fondness
,
all
affection
.
*NL*
Nothing
else
in
it
--
no
,
nothing
,
nothing
!
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
happy
I
was
,
down
upon
the
floor
,
with
my
sweet
beautiful
*NL*
girl
down
upon
the
floor
too
,
holding
my
scarred
face
to
her
lovely
*NL*
cheek
,
bathing
it
with
tears
and
kisses
,
rocking
me
to
and
fro
like
a
*NL*
child
,
calling
me
by
every
tender
name
that
she
could
think
of
,
and
*NL*
pressing
me
to
her
faithful
heart
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
secret
I
had
to
keep
had
been
mine
,
I
must
have
confided
it
to
*NL*
Ada
before
we
had
been
long
together
.
But
it
was
not
mine
,
and
I
did
*NL*
not
feel
that
I
had
a
right
to
tell
it
,
even
to
my
guardian
,
unless
*NL*
some
great
emergency
arose
.
It
was
a
weight
to
bear
alone
;
still
my
*NL*
present
duty
appeared
to
be
plain
,
and
blest
in
the
attachment
of
my
*NL*
dear
,
I
did
not
want
an
impulse
and
encouragement
to
do
it
.
Though
*NL*
often
when
she
was
asleep
and
all
was
quiet
,
the
remembrance
of
my
*NL*
mother
kept
me
waking
and
made
the
night
sorrowful
,
I
did
not
yield
*NL*
to
it
at
another
time
;
and
Ada
found
me
what
I
used
to
be
--
except
,
of
*NL*
course
,
in
that
particular
of
which
I
have
said
enough
and
which
I
*NL*
have
no
intention
of
mentioning
any
more
just
now
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
difficulty
that
I
felt
in
being
quite
composed
that
first
evening
*NL*
when
Ada
asked
me
,
over
our
work
,
if
the
family
were
at
the
house
,
*NL*
and
when
I
was
obliged
to
answer
yes
,
I
believed
so
,
for
Lady
Dedlock
*NL*
had
spoken
to
me
in
the
woods
the
day
before
yesterday
,
was
great
.
*NL*
Greater
still
when
Ada
asked
me
what
she
had
said
,
and
when
I
replied
*NL*
that
she
had
been
kind
and
interested
,
and
when
Ada
,
while
admitting
*NL*
her
beauty
and
elegance
,
remarked
upon
her
proud
manner
and
her
*NL*
imperious
chilling
air
.
But
Charley
helped
me
through
,
unconsciously
,
*NL*
by
telling
us
that
Lady
Dedlock
had
only
stayed
at
the
house
two
*NL*
nights
on
her
way
from
London
to
visit
at
some
other
great
house
in
*NL*
the
next
county
and
that
she
had
left
early
on
the
morning
after
we
*NL*
had
seen
her
at
our
view
,
as
we
called
it
.
Charley
verified
the
adage
*NL*
about
little
pitchers
,
I
am
sure
,
for
she
heard
of
more
sayings
and
*NL*
doings
in
a
day
than
would
have
come
to
my
ears
in
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
to
stay
a
month
at
Mr.
Boythorn
's
.
My
pet
had
scarcely
been
*NL*
there
a
bright
week
,
as
I
recollect
the
time
,
when
one
evening
after
*NL*
we
had
finished
helping
the
gardener
in
watering
his
flowers
,
and
*NL*
just
as
the
candles
were
lighted
,
Charley
,
appearing
with
a
very
*NL*
important
air
behind
Ada
's
chair
,
beckoned
me
mysteriously
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
If
you
please
,
miss
,
''
said
Charley
in
a
whisper
,
with
her
eyes
*NL*
at
their
roundest
and
largest
.
``
You
're
wanted
at
the
Dedlock
Arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
``
who
can
possibly
want
me
at
the
*NL*
public-house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
miss
,
''
returned
Charley
,
putting
her
head
forward
and
*NL*
folding
her
hands
tight
upon
the
band
of
her
little
apron
,
which
she
*NL*
always
did
in
the
enjoyment
of
anything
mysterious
or
confidential
,
*NL*
``
but
it
's
a
gentleman
,
miss
,
and
his
compliments
,
and
will
you
please
*NL*
to
come
without
saying
anything
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
compliments
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
`
n
,
miss
,
''
returned
Charley
,
whose
grammatical
education
was
*NL*
advancing
,
but
not
very
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
come
to
be
the
messenger
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
the
messenger
,
if
you
please
,
miss
,
''
returned
my
little
*NL*
maid
.
``
It
was
W.
Grubble
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
W.
Grubble
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mister
Grubble
,
miss
,
''
returned
Charley
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
,
miss
?
The
*NL*
Dedlock
Arms
,
by
W.
Grubble
,
''
which
Charley
delivered
as
if
she
were
*NL*
slowly
spelling
out
the
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
?
The
landlord
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
.
If
you
please
,
miss
,
his
wife
is
a
beautiful
woman
,
but
*NL*
she
broke
her
ankle
,
and
it
never
joined
.
And
her
brother
's
the
*NL*
sawyer
that
was
put
in
the
cage
,
miss
,
and
they
expect
he
'll
drink
*NL*
himself
to
death
entirely
on
beer
,
''
said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
knowing
what
might
be
the
matter
,
and
being
easily
apprehensive
*NL*
now
,
I
thought
it
best
to
go
to
this
place
by
myself
.
I
bade
Charley
*NL*
be
quick
with
my
bonnet
and
veil
and
my
shawl
,
and
having
put
them
*NL*
on
,
went
away
down
the
little
hilly
street
,
where
I
was
as
much
at
*NL*
home
as
in
Mr.
Boythorn
's
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Grubble
was
standing
in
his
shirt-sleeves
at
the
door
of
his
very
*NL*
clean
little
tavern
waiting
for
me
.
He
lifted
off
his
hat
with
both
*NL*
hands
when
he
saw
me
coming
,
and
carrying
it
so
,
as
if
it
were
an
*NL*
iron
vessel
-LRB-
it
looked
as
heavy
-RRB-
,
preceded
me
along
the
sanded
*NL*
passage
to
his
best
parlour
,
a
neat
carpeted
room
with
more
plants
in
*NL*
it
than
were
quite
convenient
,
a
coloured
print
of
Queen
Caroline
,
*NL*
several
shells
,
a
good
many
tea-trays
,
two
stuffed
and
dried
fish
in
*NL*
glass
cases
,
and
either
a
curious
egg
or
a
curious
pumpkin
-LRB-
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
which
,
and
I
doubt
if
many
people
did
-RRB-
hanging
from
his
*NL*
ceiling
.
I
knew
Mr.
Grubble
very
well
by
sight
,
from
his
often
*NL*
standing
at
his
door
.
A
pleasant-looking
,
stoutish
,
middle-aged
man
*NL*
who
never
seemed
to
consider
himself
cozily
dressed
for
his
own
*NL*
fire-side
without
his
hat
and
top-boots
,
but
who
never
wore
a
coat
*NL*
except
at
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
snuffed
the
candle
,
and
backing
away
a
little
to
see
how
it
*NL*
looked
,
backed
out
of
the
room
--
unexpectedly
to
me
,
for
I
was
going
*NL*
to
ask
him
by
whom
he
had
been
sent
.
The
door
of
the
opposite
parlour
*NL*
being
then
opened
,
I
heard
some
voices
,
familiar
in
my
ears
I
*NL*
thought
,
which
stopped
.
A
quick
light
step
approached
the
room
in
*NL*
which
I
was
,
and
who
should
stand
before
me
but
Richard
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Esther
!
''
he
said
.
``
My
best
friend
!
''
And
he
really
was
so
*NL*
warm-hearted
and
earnest
that
in
the
first
surprise
and
pleasure
of
*NL*
his
brotherly
greeting
I
could
scarcely
find
breath
to
tell
him
that
*NL*
Ada
was
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answering
my
very
thoughts
--
always
the
same
dear
girl
!
''
said
*NL*
Richard
,
leading
me
to
a
chair
and
seating
himself
beside
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
veil
up
,
but
not
quite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
the
same
dear
girl
!
''
said
Richard
just
as
heartily
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
up
my
veil
altogether
,
and
laying
my
hand
on
Richard
's
sleeve
*NL*
and
looking
in
his
face
,
told
him
how
much
I
thanked
him
for
his
kind
*NL*
welcome
and
how
greatly
I
rejoiced
to
see
him
,
the
more
so
because
of
*NL*
the
determination
I
had
made
in
my
illness
,
which
I
now
conveyed
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
there
is
no
one
with
whom
I
have
a
greater
*NL*
wish
to
talk
than
you
,
for
I
want
you
to
understand
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
want
you
,
Richard
,
''
said
I
,
shaking
my
head
,
``
to
understand
*NL*
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
refer
so
immediately
to
John
Jarndyce
,
''
said
Richard
,
''
--
I
*NL*
suppose
you
mean
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
may
say
at
once
that
I
am
glad
of
it
,
because
it
is
on
that
*NL*
subject
that
I
am
anxious
to
be
understood
.
By
you
,
mind
--
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
!
I
am
not
accountable
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
or
Mr.
Anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
pained
to
find
him
taking
this
tone
,
and
he
observed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
we
wo
n't
go
into
that
now
.
I
*NL*
want
to
appear
quietly
in
your
country-house
here
,
with
you
under
my
*NL*
arm
,
and
give
my
charming
cousin
a
surprise
.
I
suppose
your
loyalty
*NL*
to
John
Jarndyce
will
allow
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Richard
,
''
I
returned
,
``
you
know
you
would
be
heartily
*NL*
welcome
at
his
house
--
your
home
,
if
you
will
but
consider
it
so
;
and
*NL*
you
are
as
heartily
welcome
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spoken
like
the
best
of
little
women
!
''
cried
Richard
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
how
he
liked
his
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
like
it
well
enough
!
''
said
Richard
.
``
It
's
all
right
.
It
does
*NL*
as
well
as
anything
else
,
for
a
time
.
I
do
n't
know
that
I
shall
care
*NL*
about
it
when
I
come
to
be
settled
,
but
I
can
sell
out
then
*NL*
and
--
however
,
never
mind
all
that
botheration
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
young
and
handsome
,
and
in
all
respects
so
perfectly
the
opposite
*NL*
of
Miss
Flite
!
And
yet
,
in
the
clouded
,
eager
,
seeking
look
that
*NL*
passed
over
him
,
so
dreadfully
like
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
town
on
leave
just
now
,
''
said
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
have
run
over
to
look
after
my
--
my
Chancery
interests
before
*NL*
the
long
vacation
,
''
said
Richard
,
forcing
a
careless
laugh
.
``
We
are
*NL*
beginning
to
spin
along
with
that
old
suit
at
last
,
I
promise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
that
I
shook
my
head
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
say
,
it
's
not
a
pleasant
subject
.
''
Richard
spoke
with
the
*NL*
same
shade
crossing
his
face
as
before
.
``
Let
it
go
to
the
four
winds
*NL*
for
to-night
.
Puff
!
Gone
!
Who
do
you
suppose
is
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
Mr.
Skimpole
's
voice
I
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
man
!
He
does
me
more
good
than
anybody
.
What
a
*NL*
fascinating
child
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
Richard
if
any
one
knew
of
their
coming
down
together
.
He
*NL*
answered
,
no
,
nobody
.
He
had
been
to
call
upon
the
dear
old
*NL*
infant
--
so
he
called
Mr.
Skimpole
--
and
the
dear
old
infant
had
told
*NL*
him
where
we
were
,
and
he
had
told
the
dear
old
infant
he
was
bent
on
*NL*
coming
to
see
us
,
and
the
dear
old
infant
had
directly
wanted
to
come
*NL*
too
;
and
so
he
had
brought
him
.
``
And
he
is
worth
--
not
to
say
his
*NL*
sordid
expenses
--
but
thrice
his
weight
in
gold
,
''
said
Richard
.
``
He
is
*NL*
such
a
cheery
fellow
.
No
worldliness
about
him
.
Fresh
and
*NL*
green-hearted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
certainly
did
not
see
the
proof
of
Mr.
Skimpole
's
worldliness
in
*NL*
his
having
his
expenses
paid
by
Richard
,
but
I
made
no
remark
about
*NL*
that
.
Indeed
,
he
came
in
and
turned
our
conversation
.
He
was
charmed
*NL*
to
see
me
,
said
he
had
been
shedding
delicious
tears
of
joy
and
*NL*
sympathy
at
intervals
for
six
weeks
on
my
account
,
had
never
been
so
*NL*
happy
as
in
hearing
of
my
progress
,
began
to
understand
the
mixture
*NL*
of
good
and
evil
in
the
world
now
,
felt
that
he
appreciated
health
*NL*
the
more
when
somebody
else
was
ill
,
did
n't
know
but
what
it
might
be
*NL*
in
the
scheme
of
things
that
A
should
squint
to
make
B
happier
in
*NL*
looking
straight
or
that
C
should
carry
a
wooden
leg
to
make
D
better
*NL*
satisfied
with
his
flesh
and
blood
in
a
silk
stocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
here
is
our
friend
Richard
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
,
``
full
of
the
brightest
visions
of
the
future
,
which
he
*NL*
evokes
out
of
the
darkness
of
Chancery
.
Now
that
's
delightful
,
that
's
*NL*
inspiriting
,
that
's
full
of
poetry
!
In
old
times
the
woods
and
*NL*
solitudes
were
made
joyous
to
the
shepherd
by
the
imaginary
piping
*NL*
and
dancing
of
Pan
and
the
nymphs
.
This
present
shepherd
,
our
*NL*
pastoral
Richard
,
brightens
the
dull
Inns
of
Court
by
making
Fortune
*NL*
and
her
train
sport
through
them
to
the
melodious
notes
of
a
judgment
*NL*
from
the
bench
.
That
's
very
pleasant
,
you
know
!
Some
ill-conditioned
*NL*
growling
fellow
may
say
to
me
,
`
What
's
the
use
of
these
legal
and
*NL*
equitable
abuses
?
How
do
you
defend
them
?
'
I
reply
,
`
My
growling
*NL*
friend
,
I
DO
N'T
defend
them
,
but
they
are
very
agreeable
to
me
.
There
*NL*
is
a
shepherd
--
youth
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
transmutes
them
into
*NL*
something
highly
fascinating
to
my
simplicity
.
I
do
n't
say
it
is
for
*NL*
this
that
they
exist
--
for
I
am
a
child
among
you
worldly
grumblers
,
*NL*
and
not
called
upon
to
account
to
you
or
myself
for
anything
--
but
it
*NL*
may
be
so
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
seriously
to
think
that
Richard
could
scarcely
have
found
a
*NL*
worse
friend
than
this
.
It
made
me
uneasy
that
at
such
a
time
when
he
*NL*
most
required
some
right
principle
and
purpose
he
should
have
this
*NL*
captivating
looseness
and
putting-off
of
everything
,
this
airy
*NL*
dispensing
with
all
principle
and
purpose
,
at
his
elbow
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
could
understand
how
such
a
nature
as
my
guardian
's
,
experienced
in
*NL*
the
world
and
forced
to
contemplate
the
miserable
evasions
and
*NL*
contentions
of
the
family
misfortune
,
found
an
immense
relief
in
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
's
avowal
of
his
weaknesses
and
display
of
guileless
candour
;
*NL*
but
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
as
artless
as
it
seemed
or
*NL*
that
it
did
not
serve
Mr.
Skimpole
's
idle
turn
quite
as
well
as
any
*NL*
other
part
,
and
with
less
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
walked
back
with
me
,
and
Mr.
Skimpole
leaving
us
at
the
*NL*
gate
,
I
walked
softly
in
with
Richard
and
said
,
``
Ada
,
my
love
,
I
have
*NL*
brought
a
gentleman
to
visit
you
.
''
It
was
not
difficult
to
read
the
*NL*
blushing
,
startled
face
.
She
loved
him
dearly
,
and
he
knew
it
,
and
I
*NL*
knew
it
.
It
was
a
very
transparent
business
,
that
meeting
as
cousins
*NL*
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
almost
mistrusted
myself
as
growing
quite
wicked
in
my
suspicions
,
*NL*
but
I
was
not
so
sure
that
Richard
loved
her
dearly
.
He
admired
her
*NL*
very
much
--
any
one
must
have
done
that
--
and
I
dare
say
would
have
*NL*
renewed
their
youthful
engagement
with
great
pride
and
ardour
but
*NL*
that
he
knew
how
she
would
respect
her
promise
to
my
guardian
.
Still
*NL*
I
had
a
tormenting
idea
that
the
influence
upon
him
extended
even
*NL*
here
,
that
he
was
postponing
his
best
truth
and
earnestness
in
this
*NL*
as
in
all
things
until
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
should
be
off
his
mind
.
*NL*
Ah
me
!
What
Richard
would
have
been
without
that
blight
,
I
never
*NL*
shall
know
now
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
Ada
,
in
his
most
ingenuous
way
,
that
he
had
not
come
to
make
*NL*
any
secret
inroad
on
the
terms
she
had
accepted
-LRB-
rather
too
*NL*
implicitly
and
confidingly
,
he
thought
-RRB-
from
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
that
he
*NL*
had
come
openly
to
see
her
and
to
see
me
and
to
justify
himself
for
*NL*
the
present
terms
on
which
he
stood
with
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
As
the
dear
*NL*
old
infant
would
be
with
us
directly
,
he
begged
that
I
would
make
an
*NL*
appointment
for
the
morning
,
when
he
might
set
himself
right
through
*NL*
the
means
of
an
unreserved
conversation
with
me
.
I
proposed
to
walk
*NL*
with
him
in
the
park
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
this
was
arranged
.
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
soon
afterwards
appeared
and
made
us
merry
for
an
hour
.
He
*NL*
particularly
requested
to
see
little
Coavinses
-LRB-
meaning
Charley
-RRB-
and
*NL*
told
her
,
with
a
patriarchal
air
,
that
he
had
given
her
late
father
*NL*
all
the
business
in
his
power
and
that
if
one
of
her
little
brothers
*NL*
would
make
haste
to
get
set
up
in
the
same
profession
,
he
hoped
he
*NL*
should
still
be
able
to
put
a
good
deal
of
employment
in
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
I
am
constantly
being
taken
in
these
nets
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
*NL*
looking
beamingly
at
us
over
a
glass
of
wine-and-water
,
``
and
am
*NL*
constantly
being
bailed
out
--
like
a
boat
.
Or
paid
off
--
like
a
ship
's
*NL*
company
.
Somebody
always
does
it
for
me
.
I
ca
n't
do
it
,
you
know
,
for
*NL*
I
never
have
any
money
.
But
somebody
does
it
.
I
get
out
by
somebody
's
*NL*
means
;
I
am
not
like
the
starling
;
I
get
out
.
If
you
were
to
ask
me
*NL*
who
somebody
is
,
upon
my
word
I
could
n't
tell
you
.
Let
us
drink
to
*NL*
somebody
.
God
bless
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
was
a
little
late
in
the
morning
,
but
I
had
not
to
wait
for
*NL*
him
long
,
and
we
turned
into
the
park
.
The
air
was
bright
and
dewy
*NL*
and
the
sky
without
a
cloud
.
The
birds
sang
delightfully
;
the
*NL*
sparkles
in
the
fern
,
the
grass
,
and
trees
,
were
exquisite
to
see
;
*NL*
the
richness
of
the
woods
seemed
to
have
increased
twenty-fold
since
*NL*
yesterday
,
as
if
,
in
the
still
night
when
they
had
looked
so
*NL*
massively
hushed
in
sleep
,
Nature
,
through
all
the
minute
details
of
*NL*
every
wonderful
leaf
,
had
been
more
wakeful
than
usual
for
the
glory
*NL*
of
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
lovely
place
,
''
said
Richard
,
looking
round
.
``
None
of
the
*NL*
jar
and
discord
of
law-suits
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
other
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
girl
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
when
I
get
affairs
in
*NL*
general
settled
,
I
shall
come
down
here
,
I
think
,
and
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
not
be
better
to
rest
now
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
to
resting
NOW
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
or
as
to
doing
anything
very
*NL*
definite
NOW
,
that
's
not
easy
.
In
short
,
it
ca
n't
be
done
;
I
ca
n't
do
*NL*
it
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
why
not
,
Esther
.
If
you
were
living
in
an
unfinished
house
,
*NL*
liable
to
have
the
roof
put
on
or
taken
off
--
to
be
from
top
to
bottom
*NL*
pulled
down
or
built
up

to-morrow
,
next
day

next
week

next

*NL*

you
would
find
it
hard

So
do
I.
Now
?
*NL*
There
's
no
now
for

suitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
almost
have
believed
in
the
attraction
on
which
my
poor
*NL*
little
wandering
friend
had
expatiated
when
I
saw
again
the
darkened
*NL*
look
of
last
night
.
Terrible
to
think
it
had
in
it
also
a
shade
of
*NL*
that
unfortunate
man
who
had
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Richard
,
''
said
I
,
``
this
is
a
bad
beginning
of
our
*NL*
conversation

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
tell
me
so

Dame
Durden

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
I
alone

It

not
I
who
cautioned
you
once
*NL*
never
to
found
a
hope
or
expectation
on
the
family
curse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
come
back
to
John
Jarndyce
!
''
said
Richard
impatiently
.
*NL*
``
Well
!
We
must
approach
him
sooner
or
later
,
for
he
is
the
staple
of
*NL*
what
I
have
to
say
,
and
it
's
as
well
at
once
.
My
dear
Esther
,
how
can
*NL*
you
be
so
blind
?
Do
n't
you
see
that
he
is
an
interested
party
and
*NL*
that
it
may
be
very
well
for
him
to
wish
me
to
know
nothing
of
the
*NL*
suit
,
and
care
nothing
about
it
,
but
that
it
may
not
be
quite
so
well
*NL*
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Richard
,
''
I
remonstrated
,
``
is
it
possible
that
you
can
ever
have
*NL*
seen
him
and
heard
him
,
that
you
can
ever
have
lived
under
his
roof
*NL*
and
known
him
,
and
can
yet
breathe
,
even
to
me
in
this
solitary
place
*NL*
where
there
is
no
one
to
hear
us
,
such
unworthy
suspicions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reddened
deeply
,
as
if
his
natural
generosity
felt
a
pang
of
*NL*
reproach
.
He
was
silent
for
a
little
while
before
he
replied
in
a
*NL*
subdued
voice
,
``
Esther
,
I
am
sure
you
know
that
I
am
not
a
mean
*NL*
fellow
and
that
I
have
some
sense
of
suspicion
and
distrust
being
*NL*
poor
qualities
in
one
of
my
years
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

very
well

I.

I

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
dear

''
retorted
Richard
,
``
and
like
you
,
because
it
*NL*
gives
me
comfort

I
had
need
to
get
some
scrap
of
comfort
out
of
all
*NL*
this
business
,
for
it
's
a
bad
one
at
the
best
,
as
I
have
no
occasion
*NL*
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
perfectly
,
''
said
I.
``
I
know
as
well
,
Richard
--
what
shall
I
*NL*
say
?
as
well
as
you
do
--
that
such
misconstructions
are
foreign
to
*NL*
your
nature
.
And
I
know
,
as
well
as
you
know
,
what
so
changes
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sister
,
come
,
''
said
Richard
a
little
more
gaily
,
``
you
will
be
*NL*
fair
with
me
at
all
events

If
I
have
the
misfortune
to
be
under
that

influence
,
so
has
he
.
If
it
has
a
little
twisted
me
,
it
may
have
a
*NL*
little
twisted
him
too
.
I
do
n't
say
that
he
is
not
an
honourable
man
,
*NL*
out
of
all
this
complication
and
uncertainty
;
I
am
sure
he
is
.
But
it
*NL*
taints
everybody

You
know
it
taints
everybody

You
have
heard
him
*NL*
say
so
fifty
times

Then
why
should
HE
escape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
I
,
``
his
is
an
uncommon
character
,

he
has
*NL*
resolutely
kept
himself
outside
the
circle

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,

replied
Richard
in
his
vivacious
way

``
I

am
not
sure
,
my
dear
girl

that
it
may
be
wise
and
specious
to
*NL*
preserve
that
outward
indifference
.
It
may
cause
other
parties
*NL*
interested
to
become
lax
about
their
interests
;
and
people
may
die
*NL*
off
,
and
points
may
drag
themselves
out
of
memory
,
and
many
things
*NL*
may
smoothly
happen
that
are
convenient
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
touched
with
pity
for
Richard
that
I
could
not
reproach
him
*NL*
any
more
,
even
by
a
look
.
I
remembered
my
guardian
's
gentleness
*NL*
towards
his
errors
and
with
what
perfect
freedom
from
resentment
he
*NL*
had
spoken
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
''
Richard
resumed
,
``
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
I
have
come
*NL*
here
to
make
underhanded
charges
against
John
Jarndyce
.
I
have
only
*NL*
come
to
justify
myself
.
What
I
say
is
,
it
was
all
very
well
and
we
*NL*
got
on
very
well
while
I
was
a
boy
,
utterly
regardless
of
this
same
*NL*
suit
;
but
as
soon
as
I
began
to
take
an
interest
in
it
and
to
look
*NL*
into
it
,
then
it
was
quite
another
thing
.
Then
John
Jarndyce
*NL*
discovers
that
Ada
and
I
must
break
off
and
that
if
I
do
n't
amend
*NL*
that
very
objectionable
course
,
I
am
not
fit
for
her
.
Now
,
Esther
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
to
amend
that
very
objectionable
course
:
I
will
not
hold
*NL*
John
Jarndyce
's
favour
on
those
unfair
terms
of
compromise
,
which
he
*NL*
has
no
right
to
dictate
.
Whether
it
pleases
him
or
displeases
him
,
I
*NL*
must
maintain
my
rights
and
Ada
's
.
I
have
been
thinking
about
it
a
*NL*
good
deal
,
and
this
is
the
conclusion
I
have
come
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
dear
Richard
!
He
had
indeed
been
thinking
about
it
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
His
face
,
his
voice
,
his
manner
,
all
showed
that
too
plainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
tell
him
honourably
-LRB-
you
are
to
know
I
have
written
to
him
*NL*
about
all
this
-RRB-
that
we
are
at
issue
and
that
we
had
better
be
at
*NL*
issue
openly
than
covertly
.
I
thank
him
for
his
goodwill
and
his
*NL*
protection
,
and
he
goes
his
road
,
and
I
go
mine
.
The
fact
is
,
our
*NL*
roads
are
not
the
same
.
Under
one
of
the
wills
in
dispute
,
I
should
*NL*
take
much
more
than
he
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
it
is
the
one
to
be
*NL*
established
,
but
there
it
is
,
and
it
has
its
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
to
learn
from
you
,
my
dear
Richard

''
said
I
,
``
of
your
*NL*
letter

I
had
heard
of
it
already
without
an
offended
or
angry
word

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

replied
Richard
,
softening
.
``
I
am
glad
I
said

was

out
of
all
this
wretched
affair

I
always
say
*NL*
that
and
have
never
doubted
it

Now
,
my
dear
Esther
,
I
know
these
*NL*
views
of
mine
appear
extremely
harsh
to
you

will
to
Ada
when
you
*NL*
tell
her
what

passed
between

But
if
you
had
gone
into
the
*NL*
case

I
have

if
you
had
only
applied
yourself
to
the
papers

I

did
when
I
was
at
Kenge

if
you
only
knew

an
accumulation

charges

counter-charges

suspicions

cross-suspicions

*NL*
they
involve

you
would
think
me
moderate
in
comparison

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so

said
I.
``
But
do
you
think
that

among
those
many

papers

there
is
much
truth

justice

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
truth

justice
somewhere
in
the
case

``
Or

long

I.

pursued
Richard
impetuously

``

must

be
brought
out

To
allow
Ada
to
be
made
a
bribe
and
hush-money
of

not
the
way
to
bring
it
out

You
say
the
suit
is
changing

Jarndyce
says
it
changes
,
has
changed

will
change
everybody

Then
the
greater

Has

returned
Richard
with
a
fierceness
kindling

in
him

again
presented
to
me
that
last
sad
reminder

young
and
earnest
,
and
energy
and
determination
have
done
wonders
*NL*
many
a
time
.
Others
have
only
half
thrown
themselves
into
it
.
I
*NL*
devote
myself
to
it
.
I
make
it
the
object
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Richard
,
my
dear
,
so
much
the
worse
,
so
much
the
worse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
do
n't
you
be
afraid
for
me

''
he
returned
affectionately
.
*NL*
``
You
're
a
dear
,
good
,
wise
,
quiet
,
blessed
girl
;
but
you
have
your
*NL*
prepossessions
.
So
I
come
round
to
John
Jarndyce
.
I
tell
you
,
my
good
*NL*
Esther
,
when
he
and
I
were
on
those
terms
which
he
found
so
*NL*
convenient
,
we
were
not
on
natural
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
division
and
animosity
your
natural
terms
,
Richard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
say
that
.
I
mean
that
all
this
business
puts
us
on
*NL*
unnatural
terms
,
with
which
natural
relations
are
incompatible
.
See
*NL*
another
reason
for
urging
it
on
!
I
may
find
out
when
it
's
over
that
I
*NL*
have
been
mistaken
in
John
Jarndyce
.
My
head
may
be
clearer
when
I
am
*NL*
free
of
it
,
and
I
may
then
agree
with
what
you
say
to-day
.
Very
well
.
*NL*
Then
I
shall
acknowledge
it
and
make
him
reparation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
postponed
to
that
imaginary
time
!
Everything
held
in
*NL*
confusion
and
indecision
until
then
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
best
of
confidantes
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
I
want
my
cousin
Ada
to
*NL*
understand
that
I
am
not
captious
,
fickle
,
and
wilful
about
John
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
but
that
I
have
this
purpose
and
reason
at
my
back
.
I
wish
*NL*
to
represent
myself
to
her
through
you
,
because
she
has
a
great
*NL*
esteem
and
respect
for
her
cousin
John
;
and
I
know
you
will
soften
*NL*
the
course
I
take
,
even
though
you
disapprove
of
it
;
and
--
and
in
*NL*
short
,
''
said
Richard
,
who
had
been
hesitating
through
these
words
,
*NL*
``
I
--
I
do
n't
like
to
represent
myself
in
this
litigious
,
contentious
,
*NL*
doubting
character

a
confiding
girl
like
Ada

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
that
he
was
more
like
himself
in
those
latter
words
than
*NL*
in
anything
he
had
said
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
acknowledged
Richard
,
``
that
may
be
true
enough
,
my
love

I
*NL*
rather
feel
it
to
be
so
.
But
I
shall
be
able
to
give
myself
fair-play
*NL*
by
and
by
.
I
shall
come
all
right
again
,
then
,
do
n't
you
be
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
if
this
were
all
he
wished
me
to
tell
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
''
said
Richard
.
``
I
am
bound
not
to
withhold
from
her
that
*NL*
John
Jarndyce
answered
my
letter
in
his
usual
manner
,
addressing
me
*NL*
as
`
My
dear
Rick
,
'
trying
to
argue
me
out
of
my
opinions
,
and
telling
*NL*
me
that
they
should
make
no
difference
in
him
.
-LRB-
All
very
well
of
*NL*
course
,
but
not
altering
the
case
.
-RRB-
I
also
want
Ada
to
know
that
if
I
*NL*
see
her
seldom
just
now
,
I
am
looking
after
her
interests
as
well
as
*NL*
my
own
--
we
two
being
in
the
same
boat
exactly
--
and
that
I
hope
she
*NL*
will
not
suppose
from
any
flying
rumours
she
may
hear
that
I
am
at
*NL*
all
light-headed
or
imprudent
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
am
always
looking
*NL*
forward
to
the
termination
of
the
suit
,
and
always
planning
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
Being
of
age
now
and
having
taken
the
step
I
have
taken
,
I
*NL*
consider
myself
free
from
any
accountability
to
John
Jarndyce
;
but
*NL*
Ada
being
still
a
ward
of
the
court
,
I
do
n't
yet
ask
her
to
renew
our
*NL*
engagement
.
When
she
is
free
to
act
for
herself
,
I
shall
be
myself
*NL*
once
more
and
we
shall
both
be
in
very
different
worldly
*NL*
circumstances
,
I
believe
.
If
you
tell
her
all
this
with
the
advantage
*NL*
of
your
considerate
way
,
you
will
do
me
a
very
great
and
a
very
kind
*NL*
service
,
my
dear
Esther
;
and
I
shall
knock
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
on
*NL*
the
head
with
greater
vigour
.
Of
course
I
ask
for
no
secrecy
at
Bleak
*NL*
House
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard

said
I
,
``
you
place
great
confidence
in

I
fear

will
not
take
advice
from
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

impossible

*NL*
*NL*
As

there
were
any

in

As

his

*NL*
``

said
he
,
laughing
.
``
I
do
n't
know
who

if
you
*NL*
may
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I

with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in

again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
Richard
,
astonished
at
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
of

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

certainly

You

or
perhaps
you
do

,
*NL*
that
under
either
of

take
something

It
's
only
a
*NL*
question
between
the
larger
sum
and
the
smaller
.
I
shall
be
within
*NL*
the
mark
any
way
.
Bless
your
heart
,
my
excellent
girl
,
''
said
Richard
,
*NL*
quite
amused
with
me
,
``
I
shall
be
all
right
!
I
shall
pull
through
,
my
*NL*
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
so
deeply
sensible
of
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
that
I
*NL*
tried
,
in
Ada
's
name
,
in
my
guardian
's
,
in
my
own
,
by
every
fervent
*NL*
means
that
I
could
think
of
,
to
warn
him
of
it
and
to
show
him
some
*NL*
of
his
mistakes
.
He
received
everything
I
said
with
patience
and
*NL*
gentleness
,
but
it
all
rebounded
from
him
without
taking
the
least
*NL*
effect
.
I
could
not
wonder
at
this
after
the
reception
his
*NL*
preoccupied
mind
had
given
to
my
guardian
's
letter
,
but
I
determined
*NL*
to
try
Ada
's
influence
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
our
walk
brought
us
round
to
the
village
again
,
and
I
went
*NL*
home
to
breakfast
,
I
prepared
Ada
for
the
account
I
was
going
to
give
*NL*
her
and
told
her
exactly
what
reason
we
had
to
dread
that
Richard
was
*NL*
losing
himself
and
scattering
his
whole
life
to
the
winds
.
It
made
*NL*
her
very
unhappy
,
of
course
,
though
she
had
a
far
,
far
greater
*NL*
reliance
on
his
correcting
his
errors
than
I
could
have
--
which
was
so
*NL*
natural
and
loving
in
my
dear
!
--
and
she
presently
wrote
him
this
*NL*
little
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
dearest
cousin
,
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
has
told
me
all
you
said
to
her
this
morning
.
I
*NL*
write
this
to
repeat
most
earnestly
for
myself
all
that
*NL*
she
said
to
you
and
to
let
you
know
how
sure
I
am
that
*NL*
you
will
sooner
or
later
find
our
cousin
John
a
pattern
*NL*
of
truth
,
sincerity
,
and
goodness
,
when
you
will
deeply
,
*NL*
deeply
grieve
to
have
done
him
-LRB-
without
intending
it
-RRB-
so
*NL*
much
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
quite
know
how
to
write
what
I
wish
to
say
next
,
*NL*
but
I
trust
you
will
understand
it
as
I
mean
it
.
I
have
*NL*
some
fears
,
my
dearest
cousin
,
that
it
may
be
partly
for
*NL*
my
sake
you
are
now
laying
up
so
much
unhappiness
for
*NL*
yourself
--
and
if
for
yourself
,
for
me
.
In
case
this
should
*NL*
be
so
,
or
in
case
you
should
entertain
much
thought
of
me
*NL*
in
what
you
are
doing
,
I
most
earnestly
entreat
and
beg
*NL*
you
to
desist
.
You
can
do
nothing
for
my
sake
that
will
*NL*
make
me
half
so
happy
as
for
ever
turning
your
back
upon
*NL*
the
shadow
in
which
we
both
were
born
.
Do
not
be
angry
*NL*
with
me
for
saying
this
.
Pray
,
pray
,
dear
Richard
,
for
my
*NL*
sake
,
and
for
your
own
,
and
in
a
natural
repugnance
for
*NL*
that
source
of
trouble
which
had
its
share
in
making
us
*NL*
both
orphans
when
we
were
very
young
,
pray
,
pray
,
let
it
*NL*
go
for
ever
.
We
have
reason
to
know
by
this
time
that
*NL*
there
is
no
good
in
it
and
no
hope
,
that
there
is
nothing
*NL*
to
be
got
from
it
but
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dearest
cousin
,
it
is
needless
for
me
to
say
that
you
*NL*
are
quite
free
and
that
it
is
very
likely
you
may
find
*NL*
some
one
whom
you
will
love
much
better
than
your
first
*NL*
fancy
.
I
am
quite
sure
,
if
you
will
let
me
say
so
,
that
*NL*
the
object
of
your
choice
would
greatly
prefer
to
follow
*NL*
your
fortunes
far
and
wide
,
however
moderate
or
poor
,
and
*NL*
see
you
happy
,
doing
your
duty
and
pursuing
your
chosen
*NL*
way
,
than
to
have
the
hope
of
being
,
or
even
to
be
,
very
*NL*
rich
with
you
-LRB-
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
-RRB-
at
the
cost
*NL*
of
dragging
years
of
procrastination
and
anxiety
and
of
*NL*
your
indifference
to
other
aims
.
You
may
wonder
at
my
*NL*
saying
this
so
confidently
with
so
little
knowledge
or
*NL*
experience
,
but
I
know
it
for
a
certainty
from
my
own
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
,
my
dearest
cousin
,
your
most
affectionate
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
note
brought
Richard
to
us
very
soon
,
but
it
made
little
change
*NL*
in
him
if
any
.
We
would
fairly
try
,
he
said
,
who
was
right
and
who
*NL*
was
wrong
--
he
would
show
us
--
we
should
see
!
He
was
animated
and
*NL*
glowing
,
as
if
Ada
's
tenderness
had
gratified
him
;
but
I
could
only
*NL*
hope
,
with
a
sigh
,
that
the
letter
might
have
some
stronger
effect
*NL*
upon
his
mind
on
re-perusal
than
it
assuredly
had
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
to
remain
with
us
that
day
and
had
taken
their
places
to
*NL*
return
by
the
coach
next
morning
,
I
sought
an
opportunity
of
speaking
*NL*
to
Mr.
Skimpole
.
Our
out-of-door
life
easily
threw
one
in
my
way
,
and
*NL*
I
delicately
said
that
there
was
a
responsibility
in
encouraging
*NL*
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Responsibility
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
?
''
he
repeated
,
catching
at
*NL*
the
word
with
the
pleasantest
smile
.
``
I
am
the
last
man
in
the
world
*NL*
for
such
a
thing
.
I
never
was
responsible
in
my
life
--
I
ca
n't
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
everybody
is
obliged
to
be
,
''
said
I
timidly
enough
,
he
*NL*
being
so
much
older
and
more
clever
than
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
really
?
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
receiving
this
new
light
with
a
most
*NL*
agreeable
jocularity
of
surprise
.
``
But
every
man
's
not
obliged
to
be
*NL*
solvent
?
I
am
not
.
I
never
was
.
See
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
took
*NL*
a
handful
of
loose
silver
and
halfpence
from
his
pocket
,
``
there
's
so
*NL*
much
money
.
I
have
not
an
idea
how
much
.
I
have
not
the
power
of
*NL*
counting
.
Call
it
four
and
ninepence
--
call
it
four
pound
nine
.
They
*NL*
tell
me
I
owe
more
than
that
.
I
dare
say
I
do
.
I
dare
say
I
owe
as
*NL*
much
as
good-natured
people
will
let
me
owe
.
If
they
do
n't
stop
,
why
*NL*
should
I
?
There
you
have
Harold
Skimpole
in
little
.
If
that
's
*NL*
responsibility
,
I
am
responsible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
perfect
ease
of
manner
with
which
he
put
the
money
up
again
and
*NL*
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
on
his
refined
face
,
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
mentioning
a
curious
little
fact
about
somebody
else
,
almost
made
me
*NL*
feel
as
if
he
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
when
you
mention
responsibility
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
I
am
disposed
to
*NL*
say
that
I
never
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
any
one
whom
I
should
*NL*
consider
so
refreshingly
responsible
as
yourself
.
You
appear
to
me
*NL*
to
be
the
very
touchstone
of
responsibility
.
When
I
see
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
intent
upon
the
perfect
working
of
the
whole
*NL*
little
orderly
system
of
which
you
are
the
centre
,
I
feel
inclined
*NL*
to
say
to
myself
--
in
fact
I
do
say
to
myself
very
often
--
THAT
'S
*NL*
responsibility
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
difficult
,
after
this
,
to
explain
what
I
meant
;
but
I
*NL*
persisted
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
all
hoped
he
would
check
and
not
*NL*
confirm
Richard
in
the
sanguine
views
he
entertained
just
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
willingly
,
''
he
retorted
,
``
if
I
could
.
But
,
my
dear
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
I
have
no
art
,
no
disguise
.
If
he
takes
me
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
leads
me
through
Westminster
Hall
in
an
airy
procession
after
*NL*
fortune
,
I
must
go
.
If
he
says
,
`
Skimpole
,
join
the
dance
!
'
I
must
*NL*
join
it
.
Common
sense
would
n't
,
I
know
,
but
I
have
NO
common
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
unfortunate
for
Richard
,
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
!
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
Do
n't
say
that
,
do
n't
say
*NL*
that
.
Let
us
suppose
him
keeping
company
with
Common
Sense
--
an
*NL*
excellent
man
--
a
good
deal
wrinkled
--
dreadfully
practical
--
change
for
*NL*
a
ten-pound
note
in
every
pocket
--
ruled
account-book
in
his
*NL*
hand
--
say
,
upon
the
whole
,
resembling
a
tax-gatherer
.
Our
dear
*NL*
Richard
,
sanguine
,
ardent
,
overleaping
obstacles
,
bursting
with
*NL*
poetry
like
a
young
bud
,
says
to
this
highly
respectable
companion
,
*NL*
'
I
see
a
golden
prospect
before
me
;
it
's
very
bright
,
it
's
very
*NL*
beautiful
,
it
's
very
joyous
;
here
I
go
,
bounding
over
the
landscape
*NL*
to
come
at
it
!
'
The
respectable
companion
instantly
knocks
him
down
*NL*
with
the
ruled
account-book
;
tells
him
in
a
literal
,
prosaic
way
that
*NL*
he
sees
no
such
thing
;
shows
him
it
's
nothing
but
fees
,
fraud
,
*NL*
horsehair
wigs
,
and
black
gowns
.
Now
you
know
that
's
a
painful
*NL*
change
--
sensible
in
the
last
degree
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
but
*NL*
disagreeable
.
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
I
have
n't
got
the
ruled
account-book
,
I
*NL*
have
none
of
the
tax-gathering
elements
in
my
composition
,
I
am
not
*NL*
at
all
respectable
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
be
.
Odd
perhaps
,
but
so
it
*NL*
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
idle
to
say
more
,
so
I
proposed
that
we
should
join
Ada
and
*NL*
Richard
,
who
were
a
little
in
advance
,
and
I
gave
up
Mr.
Skimpole
in
*NL*
despair
.
He
had
been
over
the
Hall
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
*NL*
whimsically
described
the
family
pictures
as
we
walked
.
There
were
*NL*
such
portentous
shepherdesses
among
the
Ladies
Dedlock
dead
and
gone
,
*NL*
he
told
us
,
that
peaceful
crooks
became
weapons
of
assault
in
their
*NL*
hands
.
They
tended
their
flocks
severely
in
buckram
and
powder
and
*NL*
put
their
sticking-plaster
patches
on
to
terrify
commoners
as
the
*NL*
chiefs
of
some
other
tribes
put
on
their
war-paint
.
There
was
a
Sir
*NL*
Somebody
Dedlock
,
with
a
battle
,
a
sprung-mine
,
volumes
of
smoke
,
*NL*
flashes
of
lightning
,
a
town
on
fire
,
and
a
stormed
fort
,
all
in
full
*NL*
action
between
his
horse
's
two
hind
legs
,
showing
,
he
supposed
,
how
*NL*
little
a
Dedlock
made
of
such
trifles
.
The
whole
race
he
represented
*NL*
as
having
evidently
been
,
in
life
,
what
he
called
``
stuffed
people
''
--
a
*NL*
large
collection
,
glassy
eyed
,
set
up
in
the
most
approved
manner
on
*NL*
their
various
twigs
and
perches
,
very
correct
,
perfectly
free
from
*NL*
animation
,
and
always
in
glass
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
so
easy
now
during
any
reference
to
the
name
but
that
I
*NL*
felt
it
a
relief
when
Richard
,
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
*NL*
hurried
away
to
meet
a
stranger
whom
he
first
descried
coming
slowly
*NL*
towards
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
Vholes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
asked
if
that
were
a
friend
of
Richard
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
and
legal
adviser
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
Now
,
my
dear
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
if
you
want
common
sense
,
responsibility
,
and
*NL*
respectability
,
all
united
--
if
you
want
an
exemplary
man
--
Vholes
is
*NL*
THE
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
known
,
we
said
,
that
Richard
was
assisted
by
any
gentleman
*NL*
of
that
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
emerged
from
legal
infancy
,
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
he
*NL*
parted
from
our
conversational
friend
Kenge
and
took
up
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
with
Vholes
.
Indeed
,
I
know
he
did
,
because
I
introduced
him
to
*NL*
Vholes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
known
him
long
?
''
asked
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vholes
?
My
dear
Miss
Clare
,
I
had
had
that
kind
of
acquaintance
with
*NL*
him
which
I
have
had
with
several
gentlemen
of
his
profession
.
He
had
*NL*
done
something
or
other
in
a
very
agreeable
,
civil
manner
--
taken
*NL*
proceedings
,
I
think
,
is
the
expression
--
which
ended
in
the
*NL*
proceeding
of
his
taking
ME
.
Somebody
was
so
good
as
to
step
in
and
*NL*
pay
the
money
--
something
and
fourpence
was
the
amount
;
I
forget
the
*NL*
pounds
and
shillings
,
but
I
know
it
ended
with
fourpence
,
because
it
*NL*
struck
me
at
the
time
as
being
so
odd
that
I
could
owe
anybody
*NL*
fourpence
--
and
after
that
I
brought
them
together
.
Vholes
asked
me
*NL*
for
the
introduction
,
and
I
gave
it
.
Now
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
''
he
*NL*
looked
inquiringly
at
us
with
his
frankest
smile
as
he
made
the
*NL*
discovery
,
``
Vholes
bribed
me
,
perhaps
?
He
gave
me
something
and
*NL*
called
it
commission
.
Was
it
a
five-pound
note
?
Do
you
know
,
I
think
*NL*
it
MUST
have
been
a
five-pound
note
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
further
consideration
of
the
point
was
prevented
by
Richard
's
*NL*
coming
back
to
us
in
an
excited
state
and
hastily
representing
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
--
a
sallow
man
with
pinched
lips
that
looked
as
if
they
were
*NL*
cold
,
a
red
eruption
here
and
there
upon
his
face
,
tall
and
thin
,
*NL*
about
fifty
years
of
age
,
high-shouldered
,
and
stooping
.
Dressed
in
*NL*
black
,
black-gloved
,
and
buttoned
to
the
chin
,
there
was
nothing
so
*NL*
remarkable
in
him
as
a
lifeless
manner
and
a
slow
,
fixed
way
he
had
*NL*
of
looking
at
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
do
n't
disturb
you
,
ladies
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
,
and
now
I
*NL*
observed
that
he
was
further
remarkable
for
an
inward
manner
of
*NL*
speaking
.
``
I
arranged
with
Mr.
Carstone
that
he
should
always
know
*NL*
when
his
cause
was
in
the
Chancellor
's
paper
,
and
being
informed
by
*NL*
one
of
my
clerks
last
night
after
post
time
that
it
stood
,
rather
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
in
the
paper
for
to-morrow
,
I
put
myself
into
the
coach
*NL*
early
this
morning
and
came
down
to
confer
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Richard
,
flushed
,
and
looking
triumphantly
at
Ada
and
me
,
*NL*
``
we
do
n't
do
these
things
in
the
old
slow
way
now
.
We
spin
along
now
!
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
,
we
must
hire
something
to
get
over
to
the
post
town
in
,
*NL*
and
catch
the
mail
to-night
,
and
go
up
by
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
you
please
,
sir

returned
Mr.
Vholes
.
``
I
am
quite
at
your
*NL*
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
''
said
Richard
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
If
I
run
down
to
*NL*
the
Dedlock
,
and
get
my
portmanteau
fastened
up
,
and
order
a
gig
,
or
*NL*
a
chaise
,
or
whatever
's
to
be
got
,
we
shall
have
an
hour
then
before
*NL*
starting
.
I
'll
come
back
to
tea
.
Cousin
Ada
,
will
you
and
Esther
take
*NL*
care
of
Mr.
Vholes
when
I
am
gone
?

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
away
directly
,
in
his
heat
and
hurry
,
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
*NL*
dusk
of
evening
.
We
who
were
left
walked
on
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Carstone
's
presence
necessary
to-morrow
,
Sir
?
''
said
I.
``
Can
*NL*
it
do
any
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
miss
,
''
Mr.
Vholes
replied
.
``
I
am
not
aware
that
it
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Ada
and
I
expressed
our
regret
that
he
should
go
,
then
,
only
to
*NL*
be
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Carstone
has
laid
down
the
principle
of
watching
his
own
*NL*
interests
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
,
``
and
when
a
client
lays
down
his
own
*NL*
principle
,
and
it
is
not
immoral
,
it
devolves
upon
me
to
carry
it
*NL*
out
.
I
wish
in
business
to
be
exact
and
open
.
I
am
a
widower
with
*NL*
three
daughters
--
Emma
,
Jane
,
and
Caroline
--
and
my
desire
is
so
to
*NL*
discharge
the
duties
of
life
as
to
leave
them
a
good
name
.
This
*NL*
appears
to
be
a
pleasant
spot
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remark
being
made
to
me
in
consequence
of
my
being
next
him
as
we
*NL*
walked
,
I
assented
and
enumerated
its
chief
attractions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
.
``
I
have
the
privilege
of
supporting
an
*NL*
aged
father
in
the
Vale
of
Taunton
--
his
native
place
--
and
I
admire
*NL*
that
country
very
much
.
I
had
no
idea
there
was
anything
so
*NL*
attractive
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
keep
up
the
conversation
,
I
asked
Mr.
Vholes
if
he
would
like
to
*NL*
live
altogether
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
miss
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
touch
me
on
a
tender
string
.
My
health
*NL*
is
not
good
-LRB-
my
digestion
being
much
impaired
-RRB-
,
and
if
I
had
only
*NL*
myself
to
consider
,
I
should
take
refuge
in
rural
habits
,
especially
*NL*
as
the
cares
of
business
have
prevented
me
from
ever
coming
much
into
*NL*
contact
with
general
society
,
and
particularly
with
ladies
'
society
,
*NL*
which
I
have
most
wished
to
mix
in
.
But
with
my
three
daughters
,
*NL*
Emma
,
Jane
,
and
Caroline
--
and
my
aged
father
--
I
can
not
afford
to
be
*NL*
selfish
.
It
is
true
I
have
no
longer
to
maintain
a
dear
grandmother
*NL*
who
died
in
her
hundred
and
second
year
,
but
enough
remains
to
render
*NL*
it
indispensable
that
the
mill
should
be
always
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
required
some
attention
to
hear
him
on
account
of
his
inward
*NL*
speaking
and
his
lifeless
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
excuse
my
having
mentioned
my
daughters
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
*NL*
are
my
weak
point
.
I
wish
to
leave
the
poor
girls
some
little
*NL*
independence
,
as
well
as
a
good
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
arrived
at
Mr.
Boythorn
's
house
,
where
the
tea-table
,
all
*NL*
prepared
,
was
awaiting
us
.
Richard
came
in
restless
and
hurried
*NL*
shortly
afterwards
,
and
leaning
over
Mr.
Vholes
's
chair
,
whispered
*NL*
something
in
his
ear
.
Mr.
Vholes
replied
aloud
--
or
as
nearly
aloud
I
*NL*
suppose
as
he
had
ever
replied
to
anything
--
``
You
will
drive
me
,
will
*NL*
you
,
sir
?
It
is
all
the
same
to
me
,
sir
.
Anything
you
please
.
I
am
*NL*
quite
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
understood
from
what
followed
that
Mr.
Skimpole
was
to
be
left
*NL*
until
the
morning
to
occupy
the
two
places
which
had
been
already
*NL*
paid
for
.
As
Ada
and
I
were
both
in
low
spirits
concerning
Richard
*NL*
and
very
sorry
so
to
part
with
him
,
we
made
it
as
plain
as
we
*NL*
politely
could
that
we
should
leave
Mr.
Skimpole
to
the
Dedlock
Arms
*NL*
and
retire
when
the
night-travellers
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
's
high
spirits
carrying
everything
before
them
,
we
all
went
*NL*
out
together
to
the
top
of
the
hill
above
the
village
,
where
he
had
*NL*
ordered
a
gig
to
wait
and
where
we
found
a
man
with
a
lantern
*NL*
standing
at
the
head
of
the
gaunt
pale
horse
that
had
been
harnessed
*NL*
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
shall
forget
those
two
seated
side
by
side
in
the
lantern
's
*NL*
light
,
Richard
all
flush
and
fire
and
laughter
,
with
the
reins
in
his
*NL*
hand
;
Mr.
Vholes
quite
still
,
black-gloved
,
and
buttoned
up
,
looking
*NL*
at
him
as
if
he
were
looking
at
his
prey
and
charming
it
.
I
have
*NL*
before
me
the
whole
picture
of
the
warm
dark
night
,
the
summer
*NL*
lightning
,
the
dusty
track
of
road
closed
in
by
hedgerows
and
high
*NL*
trees
,
the
gaunt
pale
horse
with
his
ears
pricked
up
,
and
the
driving
*NL*
away
at
speed
to
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
girl
told
me
that
night
how
Richard
's
being
thereafter
*NL*
prosperous
or
ruined
,
befriended
or
deserted
,
could
only
make
this
*NL*
difference
to
her
,
that
the
more
he
needed
love
from
one
unchanging
*NL*
heart
,
the
more
love
that
unchanging
heart
would
have
to
give
him
;
*NL*
how
he
thought
of
her
through
his
present
errors
,
and
she
would
think
*NL*
of
him
at
all
times
--
never
of
herself
if
she
could
devote
herself
to
*NL*
him
,
never
of
her
own
delights
if
she
could
minister
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
kept
her
word
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
look
along
the
road
before
me
,
where
the
distance
already
shortens
*NL*
and
the
journey
's
end
is
growing
visible
;
and
true
and
good
above
the
*NL*
dead
sea
of
the
Chancery
suit
and
all
the
ashy
fruit
it
cast
ashore
,
*NL*
I
think
I
see
my
darling

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
Struggle
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
our
time
came
for
returning
to
Bleak
House
again
,
we
were
*NL*
punctual
to
the
day
and
were
received
with
an
overpowering
welcome
.
I
*NL*
was
perfectly
restored
to
health
and
strength
,
and
finding
my
*NL*
housekeeping
keys
laid
ready
for
me
in
my
room
,
rang
myself
in
as
if
*NL*
I
had
been
a
new
year
,
with
a
merry
little
peal
.
``
Once
more
,
duty
,
*NL*
duty
,
Esther
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
if
you
are
not
overjoyed
to
do
it
,
more
*NL*
than
cheerfully
and
contentedly
,
through
anything
and
everything
,
you
*NL*
ought
to
be
.
That
's
all
I
have
to
say
to
you
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
few
mornings
were
mornings
of
so
much
bustle
and
business
,
*NL*
devoted
to
such
settlements
of
accounts
,
such
repeated
journeys
to
*NL*
and
fro
between
the
growlery
and
all
other
parts
of
the
house
,
so
*NL*
many
rearrangements
of
drawers
and
presses
,
and
such
a
general
new
*NL*
beginning
altogether
,
that
I
had
not
a
moment
's
leisure
.
But
when
*NL*
these
arrangements
were
completed
and
everything
was
in
order
,
I
paid
*NL*
a
visit
of
a
few
hours
to
London
,
which
something
in
the
letter
I
had
*NL*
destroyed
at
Chesney
Wold
had
induced
me
to
decide
upon
in
my
own
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
Caddy
Jellyby
--
her
maiden
name
was
so
natural
to
me
that
I
*NL*
always
called
her
by
it
--
the
pretext
for
this
visit
and
wrote
her
a
*NL*
note
previously
asking
the
favour
of
her
company
on
a
little
business
*NL*
expedition
.
Leaving
home
very
early
in
the
morning
,
I
got
to
London
*NL*
by
stage-coach
in
such
good
time
that
I
got
to
Newman
Street
with
the
*NL*
day
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
,
who
had
not
seen
me
since
her
wedding-day
,
was
so
glad
and
so
*NL*
affectionate
that
I
was
half
inclined
to
fear
I
should
make
her
*NL*
husband
jealous
.
But
he
was
,
in
his
way
,
just
as
bad
--
I
mean
as
good
;
*NL*
and
in
short
it
was
the
old
story
,
and
nobody
would
leave
me
any
*NL*
possibility
of
doing
anything
meritorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
Mr.
Turveydrop
was
in
bed
,
I
found
,
and
Caddy
was
*NL*
milling
his
chocolate
,
which
a
melancholy
little
boy
who
was
an
*NL*
apprentice
--
it
seemed
such
a
curious
thing
to
be
apprenticed
to
the
*NL*
trade
of
dancing
--
was
waiting
to
carry
upstairs
.
Her
father-in-law
*NL*
was
extremely
kind
and
considerate
,
Caddy
told
me
,
and
they
lived
*NL*
most
happily
together
.
-LRB-
When
she
spoke
of
their
living
together
,
she
*NL*
meant
that
the
old
gentleman
had
all
the
good
things
and
all
the
good
*NL*
lodging
,
while
she
and
her
husband
had
what
they
could
get
,
and
were
*NL*
poked
into
two
corner
rooms
over
the
Mews
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
your
mama
,
Caddy
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
hear
of
her
,
Esther
,
''
replied
Caddy
,
``
through
Pa
,
but
I
see
*NL*
very
little
of
her
.
We
are
good
friends
,
I
am
glad
to
say
,
but
Ma
*NL*
thinks
there
is
something
absurd
in
my
having
married
a
*NL*
dancing-master
,
and
she
is
rather
afraid
of
its
extending
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
me
that
if
Mrs.
Jellyby
had
discharged
her
own
natural
*NL*
duties
and
obligations
before
she
swept
the
horizon
with
a
telescope
*NL*
in
search
of
others
,
she
would
have
taken
the
best
precautions
*NL*
against
becoming
absurd
,
but
I
need
scarcely
observe
that
I
kept
this
*NL*
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
papa
,
Caddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
comes
here
every
evening
,
''
returned
Caddy
,
``
and
is
so
fond
of
*NL*
sitting
in
the
corner
there
that
it
's
a
treat
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
at
the
corner
,
I
plainly
perceived
the
mark
of
Mr.
Jellyby
's
*NL*
head
against
the
wall
.
It
was
consolatory
to
know
that
he
had
found
*NL*
such
a
resting-place
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Caddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
are
always
busy
,
I
'll
be
bound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
returned
Caddy
,
``
I
am
indeed
,
for
to
tell
you
a
*NL*
grand
secret
,
I
am
qualifying
myself
to
give
lessons
.
Prince
's
health
*NL*
is
not
strong
,
and
I
want
to
be
able
to
assist
him
.
What
with
*NL*
schools
,
and
classes
here
,
and
private
pupils
,
AND
the
apprentices
,
*NL*
he
really
has
too
much
to
do
,
poor
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
notion
of
the
apprentices
was
still
so
odd
to
me
that
I
asked
*NL*
Caddy
if
there
were
many
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
,
''
said
Caddy
.
``
One
in-door
,
and
three
out
.
They
are
*NL*
very
good
children
;
only
when
they
get
together
they
WILL
*NL*
play
--
children-like
--
instead
of
attending
to
their
work
.
So
the
*NL*
little
boy
you
saw
just
now
waltzes
by
himself
in
the
empty
kitchen
,
*NL*
and
we
distribute
the
others
over
the
house
as
well
as
we
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
only
for
their
steps
,
of
course
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
their
steps
,
''
said
Caddy
.
``
In
that
way
they
practise
,
so
*NL*
many
hours
at
a
time
,
whatever
steps
they
happen
to
be
upon
.
They
*NL*
dance
in
the
academy
,
and
at
this
time
of
year
we
do
figures
at
five
*NL*
every
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
laborious
life
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
,
''
returned
Caddy
,
smiling
,
``
when
the
out-door
*NL*
apprentices
ring
us
up
in
the
morning
-LRB-
the
bell
rings
into
our
room
,
*NL*
not
to
disturb
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
-RRB-
,
and
when
I
put
up
the
window
and
*NL*
see
them
standing
on
the
door-step
with
their
little
pumps
under
*NL*
their
arms
,
I
am
actually
reminded
of
the
Sweeps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
presented
the
art
to
me
in
a
singular
light
,
to
be
sure
.
*NL*
Caddy
enjoyed
the
effect
of
her
communication
and
cheerfully
*NL*
recounted
the
particulars
of
her
own
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
dear
,
to
save
expense
I
ought
to
know
something
of
the
*NL*
piano
,
and
I
ought
to
know
something
of
the
kit
too
,
and
consequently
*NL*
I
have
to
practise
those
two
instruments
as
well
as
the
details
of
*NL*
our
profession
.
If
Ma
had
been
like
anybody
else
,
I
might
have
had
*NL*
some
little
musical
knowledge
to
begin
upon
.
However
,
I
had
n't
any
;
*NL*
and
that
part
of
the
work
is
,
at
first
,
a
little
discouraging
,
I
must
*NL*
allow
.
But
I
have
a
very
good
ear
,
and
I
am
used
to
drudgery
--
I
have
*NL*
to
thank
Ma
for
that
,
at
all
events
--
and
where
there
's
a
will
there
's
*NL*
a
way
,
you
know
,
Esther
,
the
world
over
.
''
Saying
these
words
,
Caddy
*NL*
laughingly
sat
down
at
a
little
jingling
square
piano
and
really
*NL*
rattled
off
a
quadrille
with
great
spirit
.
Then
she
good-humouredly
*NL*
and
blushingly
got
up
again
,
and
while
she
still
laughed
herself
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
,
please
;
that
's
a
dear
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
sooner
have
cried
,
but
I
did
neither
.
I
encouraged
her
and
*NL*
praised
her
with
all
my
heart
.
For
I
conscientiously
believed
,
*NL*
dancing-master
's
wife
though
she
was
,
and
dancing-mistress
though
in
*NL*
her
limited
ambition
she
aspired
to
be
,
she
had
struck
out
a
natural
,
*NL*
wholesome
,
loving
course
of
industry
and
perseverance
that
was
quite
*NL*
as
good
as
a
mission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Caddy
,
delighted
,
``
you
ca
n't
think
how
you
cheer
me
.
*NL*
I
shall
owe
you
,
you
do
n't
know
how
much
.
What
changes
,
Esther
,
even
*NL*
in
my
small
world
!
You
recollect
that
first
night
,
when
I
was
so
*NL*
unpolite
and
inky
?
Who
would
have
thought
,
then
,
of
my
ever
teaching
*NL*
people
to
dance
,
of
all
other
possibilities
and
impossibilities
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
,
who
had
left
us
while
we
had
this
chat
,
now
coming
back
,
*NL*
preparatory
to
exercising
the
apprentices
in
the
ball-room
,
Caddy
*NL*
informed
me
she
was
quite
at
my
disposal
.
But
it
was
not
my
time
yet
,
*NL*
I
was
glad
to
tell
her
,
for
I
should
have
been
vexed
to
take
her
away
*NL*
then
.
Therefore
we
three
adjourned
to
the
apprentices
together
,
and
I
*NL*
made
one
in
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apprentices
were
the
queerest
little
people
.
Besides
the
*NL*
melancholy
boy
,
who
,
I
hoped
,
had
not
been
made
so
by
waltzing
alone
*NL*
in
the
empty
kitchen
,
there
were
two
other
boys
and
one
dirty
little
*NL*
limp
girl
in
a
gauzy
dress
.
Such
a
precocious
little
girl
,
with
such
*NL*
a
dowdy
bonnet
on
-LRB-
that
,
too
,
of
a
gauzy
texture
-RRB-
,
who
brought
her
*NL*
sandalled
shoes
in
an
old
threadbare
velvet
reticule
.
Such
mean
*NL*
little
boys
,
when
they
were
not
dancing
,
with
string
,
and
marbles
,
*NL*
and
cramp-bones
in
their
pockets
,
and
the
most
untidy
legs
and
*NL*
feet
--
and
heels
particularly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
Caddy
what
had
made
their
parents
choose
this
profession
for
*NL*
them
.
Caddy
said
she
did
n't
know
;
perhaps
they
were
designed
for
*NL*
teachers
,
perhaps
for
the
stage
.
They
were
all
people
in
humble
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
the
melancholy
boy
's
mother
kept
a
ginger-beer
*NL*
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
danced
for
an
hour
with
great
gravity
,
the
melancholy
child
doing
*NL*
wonders
with
his
lower
extremities
,
in
which
there
appeared
to
be
*NL*
some
sense
of
enjoyment
though
it
never
rose
above
his
waist
.
Caddy
,
*NL*
while
she
was
observant
of
her
husband
and
was
evidently
founded
upon
*NL*
him
,
had
acquired
a
grace
and
self-possession
of
her
own
,
which
,
*NL*
united
to
her
pretty
face
and
figure
,
was
uncommonly
agreeable
.
She
*NL*
already
relieved
him
of
much
of
the
instruction
of
these
young
*NL*
people
,
and
he
seldom
interfered
except
to
walk
his
part
in
the
*NL*
figure
if
he
had
anything
to
do
in
it
.
He
always
played
the
tune
.
The
*NL*
affectation
of
the
gauzy
child
,
and
her
condescension
to
the
boys
,
*NL*
was
a
sight
.
And
thus
we
danced
an
hour
by
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
practice
was
concluded
,
Caddy
's
husband
made
himself
ready
*NL*
to
go
out
of
town
to
a
school
,
and
Caddy
ran
away
to
get
ready
to
go
*NL*
out
with
me
.
I
sat
in
the
ball-room
in
the
interval
,
contemplating
*NL*
the
apprentices
.
The
two
out-door
boys
went
upon
the
staircase
to
put
*NL*
on
their
half-boots
and
pull
the
in-door
boy
's
hair
,
as
I
judged
from
*NL*
the
nature
of
his
objections
.
Returning
with
their
jackets
buttoned
*NL*
and
their
pumps
stuck
in
them
,
they
then
produced
packets
of
cold
*NL*
bread
and
meat
and
bivouacked
under
a
painted
lyre
on
the
wall
.
The
*NL*
little
gauzy
child
,
having
whisked
her
sandals
into
the
reticule
and
*NL*
put
on
a
trodden-down
pair
of
shoes
,
shook
her
head
into
the
dowdy
*NL*
bonnet
at
one
shake
,
and
answering
my
inquiry
whether
she
liked
*NL*
dancing
by
replying
,
``
Not
with
boys
,
''
tied
it
across
her
chin
,
and
*NL*
went
home
contemptuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Mr.
Turveydrop
is
so
sorry
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
that
he
has
not
*NL*
finished
dressing
yet
and
can
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
*NL*
before
you
go
.
You
are
such
a
favourite
of
his
,
Esther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
myself
much
obliged
to
him
,
but
did
not
think
it
*NL*
necessary
to
add
that
I
readily
dispensed
with
this
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
takes
him
a
long
time
to
dress
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
because
he
is
very
*NL*
much
looked
up
to
in
such
things
,
you
know
,
and
has
a
reputation
to
*NL*
support
.
You
ca
n't
think
how
kind
he
is
to
Pa.
.
He
talks
to
Pa
of
an
*NL*
evening
about
the
Prince
Regent
,
and
I
never
saw
Pa
so
interested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
picture
of
Mr.
Turveydrop
bestowing
his
*NL*
deportment
on
Mr.
Jellyby
that
quite
took
my
fancy
.
I
asked
Caddy
if
*NL*
he
brought
her
papa
out
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Caddy
,
``
I
do
n't
know
that
he
does
that
,
but
he
talks
to
*NL*
Pa
,
and
Pa
greatly
admires
him
,
and
listens
,
and
likes
it
.
Of
course
*NL*
I
am
aware
that
Pa
has
hardly
any
claims
to
deportment
,
but
they
get
*NL*
on
together
delightfully
.
You
ca
n't
think
what
good
companions
they
*NL*
make
.
I
never
saw
Pa
take
snuff
before
in
my
life
,
but
he
takes
one
*NL*
pinch
out
of
Mr.
Turveydrop
's
box
regularly
and
keeps
putting
it
to
*NL*
his
nose
and
taking
it
away
again
all
the
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
should
ever
,
in
the
chances
and
changes
of
*NL*
life
,
have
come
to
the
rescue
of
Mr.
Jellyby
from
Borrioboola-Gha
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
of
oddities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
Peepy
,
''
said
Caddy
with
a
little
hesitation
,
``
whom
I
was
most
*NL*
afraid
of
--
next
to
having
any
family
of
my
own
,
Esther
--
as
an
*NL*
inconvenience
to
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
the
kindness
of
the
old
gentleman
to
*NL*
that
child
is
beyond
everything
.
He
asks
to
see
him
,
my
dear
!
He
lets
*NL*
him
take
the
newspaper
up
to
him
in
bed
;
he
gives
him
the
crusts
of
*NL*
his
toast
to
eat
;
he
sends
him
on
little
errands
about
the
house
;
he
*NL*
tells
him
to
come
to
me
for
sixpences
.
In
short
,
''
said
Caddy
*NL*
cheerily
,
``
and
not
to
prose
,
I
am
a
very
fortunate
girl
and
ought
to
*NL*
be
very
grateful
.
Where
are
we
going
,
Esther
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Old
Street
Road
,
''
said
I
,
``
where
I
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
*NL*
the
solicitor
's
clerk
who
was
sent
to
meet
me
at
the
coach-office
on
*NL*
the
very
day
when
I
came
to
London
and
first
saw
you
,
my
dear
.
Now
I
*NL*
think
of
it
,
the
gentleman
who
brought
us
to
your
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
indeed
,
I
seem
to
be
naturally
the
person
to
go
with
you
,
''
*NL*
returned
Caddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
Old
Street
Road
we
went
and
there
inquired
at
Mrs.
Guppy
's
*NL*
residence
for
Mrs.
Guppy
.
Mrs.
Guppy
,
occupying
the
parlours
and
*NL*
having
indeed
been
visibly
in
danger
of
cracking
herself
like
a
nut
*NL*
in
the
front-parlour
door
by
peeping
out
before
she
was
asked
for
,
*NL*
immediately
presented
herself
and
requested
us
to
walk
in
.
She
was
an
*NL*
old
lady
in
a
large
cap
,
with
rather
a
red
nose
and
rather
an
*NL*
unsteady
eye
,
but
smiling
all
over
.
Her
close
little
sitting-room
was
*NL*
prepared
for
a
visit
,
and
there
was
a
portrait
of
her
son
in
it
*NL*
which
,
I
had
almost
written
here
,
was
more
like
than
life
:
it
*NL*
insisted
upon
him
with
such
obstinacy
,
and
was
so
determined
not
to
*NL*
let
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
was
the
portrait
there
,
but
we
found
the
original
there
too
.
*NL*
He
was
dressed
in
a
great
many
colours
and
was
discovered
at
a
table
*NL*
reading
law-papers
with
his
forefinger
to
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
rising
,
``
this
is
indeed
an
oasis
.
*NL*
Mother
,
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
put
a
chair
for
the
other
lady
and
*NL*
get
out
of
the
gangway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Guppy
,
whose
incessant
smiling
gave
her
quite
a
waggish
*NL*
appearance
,
did
as
her
son
requested
and
then
sat
down
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
holding
her
pocket
handkerchief
to
her
chest
,
like
a
fomentation
,
*NL*
with
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
presented
Caddy
,
and
Mr.
Guppy
said
that
any
friend
of
mine
was
*NL*
more
than
welcome
.
I
then
proceeded
to
the
object
of
my
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
liberty
of
sending
you
a
note
,
sir
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
acknowledged
the
receipt
by
taking
it
out
of
his
*NL*
breast-pocket
,
putting
it
to
his
lips
,
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
*NL*
with
a
bow
.
Mr.
Guppy
's
mother
was
so
diverted
that
she
rolled
her
*NL*
head
as
she
smiled
and
made
a
silent
appeal
to
Caddy
with
her
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
I
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
moment
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Anything
like
the
jocoseness
of
Mr.
Guppy
's
mother
just
now
,
I
think
*NL*
I
never
saw
.
She
made
no
sound
of
laughter
,
but
she
rolled
her
head
,
*NL*
and
shook
it
,
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
,
and
appealed
to
*NL*
Caddy
with
her
elbow
,
and
her
hand
,
and
her
shoulder
,
and
was
so
*NL*
unspeakably
entertained
altogether
that
it
was
with
some
difficulty
*NL*
she
could
marshal
Caddy
through
the
little
folding-door
into
her
*NL*
bedroom
adjoining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
you
will
excuse
the
waywardness
of
*NL*
a
parent
ever
mindful
of
a
son
's
appiness
.
My
mother
,
though
highly
*NL*
exasperating
to
the
feelings
,
is
actuated
by
maternal
dictates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hardly
have
believed
that
anybody
could
in
a
moment
have
*NL*
turned
so
red
or
changed
so
much
as
Mr.
Guppy
did
when
I
now
put
up
*NL*
my
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
the
favour
of
seeing
you
for
a
few
moments
here
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
in
preference
to
calling
at
Mr.
Kenge
's
because
,
remembering
what
*NL*
you
said
on
an
occasion
when
you
spoke
to
me
in
confidence
,
I
feared
*NL*
I
might
otherwise
cause
you
some
embarrassment
,
Mr.
Guppy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
caused
him
embarrassment
enough
as
it
was
,
I
am
sure
.
I
never
saw
*NL*
such
faltering
,
such
confusion
,
such
amazement
and
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson

stammered
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
I
--
I

beg
your
pardon

our
profession

to
be
explicit

You
have
*NL*
referred
to
an
occasion

when
I

when
I
did
myself
the
honour
*NL*
of
making
a
declaration

--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
seemed
to
rise
in
his
throat
that
he
could
not
possibly
*NL*
swallow
.
He
put
his
hand
there
,
coughed
,
made
faces
,
tried
again
to
*NL*
swallow
it
,
coughed
again
,
made
faces
again
,
looked
all
round
the
*NL*
room
,
and
fluttered
his
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
kind
of
giddy
sensation
has
come
upon
me
,

''
he
explained
,
*NL*
``
which
rather
knocks
me
over

I

thing

--
by
George
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
a
little
time
to
recover
.
He
consumed
it
in
putting
his
*NL*
hand
to
his
forehead
and
taking
it
away
again
,
and
in
backing
his
*NL*
chair
into
the
corner
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
intention
was
to
remark

said
Mr.
Guppy
,
``

*NL*
me

something
bronchial

good
on

occasion
as
to
repel

You

you
would
n't
perhaps
object

Though
no

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
returned
,
measuring
the

with
his
troubled

I.

*NL*
``

I.

*NL*
``

returned
Mr.

``
Very

''
Mr.
Guppy
's
bronchitis
came
to
his
relief
and
stopped
his
*NL*
measurement
of
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
now
perhaps
mention
what
I
wished

I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Mr.

as
square

I
can
have
nothing

pleasure

sure

any
observations
you

good

on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me

''
said
Mr.

,
``
but
we
had
better
not
travel
out
*NL*
of
the
record
into
implication

I
can
not
admit
that
I
implied
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
on
that
occasion
,
''
I
recommenced
,
``
that
you
might
possibly
*NL*
have
the
means
of
advancing
my
interests
and
promoting
my
fortunes
by
*NL*
making
discoveries
of
which
I
should
be
the
subject
.
I
presume
that
*NL*
you
founded
that
belief
upon
your
general
knowledge
of
my
being
an
*NL*
orphan
girl
,
indebted
for
everything
to
the
benevolence
of
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
Now
,
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
what
I
have
come
to
beg
*NL*
of
you
is
,
Mr.
Guppy
,
that
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
relinquish
*NL*
all
idea
of
so
serving
me
.
I
have
thought
of
this
sometimes
,
and
I
*NL*
have
thought
of
it
most
lately
--
since
I
have
been
ill
.
At
length
I
*NL*
have
decided
,
in
case
you
should
at
any
time
recall
that
purpose
and
*NL*
act
upon
it
in
any
way
,
to
come
to
you
and
assure
you
that
you
are
*NL*
altogether
mistaken
.
You
could
make
no
discovery
in
reference
to
me
*NL*
that
would
do
me
the
least
service
or
give
me
the
least
pleasure
.
I
*NL*
am
acquainted
with
my
personal
history
,
and
I
have
it
in
my
power
to
*NL*
assure
you
that
you
never
can
advance
my
welfare
by
such
means
.
You
*NL*
may
,
perhaps
,
have
abandoned
this
project
a
long
time
.
If
so
,
excuse
*NL*
my
giving
you
unnecessary
trouble
.
If
not
,
I
entreat
you
,
on
the
*NL*
assurance
I
have
given
you
,
henceforth
to
lay
it
aside
.
I
beg
you
to
*NL*
do
this
,
for
my
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bound
to
confess
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
that
you
express
yourself
,
*NL*
miss
,
with
that
good
sense
and
right
feeling
for
which
I
gave
you

credit
.
Nothing
can
be
more
satisfactory
than
such
right
feeling
,
and
*NL*
if
I
mistook
any
intentions
on
your
part
just
now
,
I
am
prepared
to
*NL*
tender
a
full
apology

I
should
wish

be

point
out
the
necessity

the

*NL*
*NL*
I
must
say
for
Mr.
Guppy
that
the
snuffling
manner
he
had
had
upon
*NL*
him
improved
very
much
.
He
seemed
truly
glad
to
be
able
to
do
*NL*
something
I
asked
,
and
he
looked
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
allow
me
to
finish
what
I
have
to
say
at
once
so
that
I
*NL*
may
have
no
occasion
to
resume

I
went
on
,
seeing
him
about
to
*NL*
speak
,
``
you
will
do
me
a
kindness

I
come
to
you
as
privately
as
*NL*
possible

you
announced
this
impression
of
yours
to
me
in
a
*NL*
confidence
which
I
have
really
wished
to
respect
--
and
which
I
always
*NL*
have
respected
,
as
you
remember

I
have
mentioned
my
illness

There
*NL*
really
is
no
reason
why
I
should
hesitate
to
say
that
I
know
very
*NL*
well
that
any
little
delicacy
I
might
have
had
in
making
a
request
to
*NL*
you
is
quite
removed
.
Therefore
I
make
the
entreaty
I
have
now
*NL*
preferred
,
and
I
hope
you
will
have
sufficient
consideration
for
me
*NL*
to
accede
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
do
Mr.
Guppy
the
further
justice
of
saying
that
he
had
looked
*NL*
more
and
more
ashamed
and
that
he
looked
most
ashamed
and
very
*NL*
earnest
when
he
now
replied
with
a
burning
face
,
``
Upon
my

honour

am
a
living

man

I
'll
act
according

your

I
'll
never
go
another
step
in
*NL*
opposition
to
it

I
'll
take
my
oath
to
it
if
it
will
be
any

satisfaction
to
you

In
what
I
promise
at
this
present
time
touching
*NL*
the
matters
now
in
question

continued
Mr.
Guppy
rapidly
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
repeating
a
familiar
form
of
words
,
``
I
speak
the
truth

the
*NL*
whole

nothing
but
the
truth

so

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite

said
I

rising
at
this
point

you
very
much

*NL*
Mr.

mother
returned
with
Caddy
-LRB-
now
making
me
the
recipient
*NL*
of
her
silent
laughter
and
her
nudges
-RRB-
,
and
we
took
our
leave
.
Mr.
*NL*
Guppy
saw
us
to
the
door
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
either
*NL*
imperfectly
awake
or
walking
in
his
sleep
;
and
we
left
him
there
,
*NL*
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
a
minute
he
came
after
us
down
the
street
without
any
hat
,
and
*NL*
with
his
long
hair
all
blown
about
,
and
stopped
us

saying
fervently

``
I

said
Mr.

going
with
one
leg

staying
with
the
other
,
``

Mr.

the

did
so

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
Attorney
and
Client
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Mr.
Vholes
,
preceded
by
the
legend
Ground-Floor
,
is
*NL*
inscribed
upon
a
door-post
in
Symond
's
Inn
,
Chancery
Lane
--
a
little
,
*NL*
pale
,
wall-eyed
,
woebegone
inn
like
a
large
dust-binn
of
two
*NL*
compartments
and
a
sifter
.
It
looks
as
if
Symond
were
a
sparing
man
*NL*
in
his
way
and
constructed
his
inn
of
old
building
materials
which
*NL*
took
kindly
to
the
dry
rot
and
to
dirt
and
all
things
decaying
and
*NL*
dismal
,
and
perpetuated
Symond
's
memory
with
congenial
shabbiness
.
*NL*
Quartered
in
this
dingy
hatchment
commemorative
of
Symond
are
the
*NL*
legal
bearings
of
Mr.
Vholes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
's
office
,
in
disposition
retiring
and
in
situation
*NL*
retired
,
is
squeezed
up
in
a
corner
and
blinks
at
a
dead
wall
.
Three
*NL*
feet
of
knotty-floored
dark
passage
bring
the
client
to
Mr.
Vholes
's
*NL*
jet-black
door
,
in
an
angle
profoundly
dark
on
the
brightest
*NL*
midsummer
morning
and
encumbered
by
a
black
bulk-head
of
cellarage
*NL*
staircase
against
which
belated
civilians
generally
strike
their
*NL*
brows
.
Mr.
Vholes
's
chambers
are
on
so
small
a
scale
that
one
clerk
*NL*
can
open
the
door
without
getting
off
his
stool
,
while
the
other
who
*NL*
elbows
him
at
the
same
desk
has
equal
facilities
for
poking
the
fire
.
*NL*
A
smell
as
of
unwholesome
sheep
blending
with
the
smell
of
must
and
*NL*
dust
is
referable
to
the
nightly
-LRB-
and
often
daily
-RRB-
consumption
of
*NL*
mutton
fat
in
candles
and
to
the
fretting
of
parchment
forms
and
*NL*
skins
in
greasy
drawers
.
The
atmosphere
is
otherwise
stale
and
close
.
*NL*
The
place
was
last
painted
or
whitewashed
beyond
the
memory
of
man
,
*NL*
and
the
two
chimneys
smoke
,
and
there
is
a
loose
outer
surface
of
*NL*
soot
everywhere
,
and
the
dull
cracked
windows
in
their
heavy
frames
*NL*
have
but
one
piece
of
character
in
them
,
which
is
a
determination
to
*NL*
be
always
dirty
and
always
shut
unless
coerced
.
This
accounts
for
the
*NL*
phenomenon
of
the
weaker
of
the
two
usually
having
a
bundle
of
*NL*
firewood
thrust
between
its
jaws
in
hot
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
is
a
very
respectable
man
.
He
has
not
a
large
business
,
*NL*
but
he
is
a
very
respectable
man
.
He
is
allowed
by
the
greater
*NL*
attorneys
who
have
made
good
fortunes
or
are
making
them
to
be
a
most
*NL*
respectable
man
.
He
never
misses
a
chance
in
his
practice
,
which
is
a
*NL*
mark
of
respectability
.
He
never
takes
any
pleasure
,
which
is
another
*NL*
mark
of
respectability
.
He
is
reserved
and
serious
,
which
is
another
*NL*
mark
of
respectability
.
His
digestion
is
impaired
,
which
is
highly
*NL*
respectable
.
And
he
is
making
hay
of
the
grass
which
is
flesh
,
for
*NL*
his
three
daughters
.
And
his
father
is
dependent
on
him
in
the
Vale
*NL*
of
Taunton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
great
principle
of
the
English
law
is
to
make
business
for
*NL*
itself
.
There
is
no
other
principle
distinctly
,
certainly
,
and
*NL*
consistently
maintained
through
all
its
narrow
turnings
.
Viewed
by
*NL*
this
light
it
becomes
a
coherent
scheme
and
not
the
monstrous
maze
*NL*
the
laity
are
apt
to
think
it
.
Let
them
but
once
clearly
perceive
*NL*
that
its
grand
principle
is
to
make
business
for
itself
at
their
*NL*
expense
,
and
surely
they
will
cease
to
grumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
perceiving
this
quite
plainly
--
only
seeing
it
by
halves
in
a
*NL*
confused
way
--
the
laity
sometimes
suffer
in
peace
and
pocket
,
with
a
*NL*
bad
grace
,
and
DO
grumble
very
much
.
Then
this
respectability
of
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
is
brought
into
powerful
play
against
them
.
``
Repeal
this
*NL*
statute
,
my
good
sir
?
''
says
Mr.
Kenge
to
a
smarting
client
.
``
Repeal
*NL*
it
,
my
dear
sir
?
Never
,
with
my
consent
.
Alter
this
law
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
what
will
be
the
effect
of
your
rash
proceeding
on
a
class
of
*NL*
practitioners
very
worthily
represented
,
allow
me
to
say
to
you
,
by
*NL*
the
opposite
attorney
in
the
case
,
Mr.
Vholes
?
Sir
,
that
class
of
*NL*
practitioners
would
be
swept
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
Now
you
*NL*
can
not
afford
--
I
will
say
,
the
social
system
can
not
afford
--
to
lose
*NL*
an
order
of
men
like
Mr.
Vholes
.
Diligent
,
persevering
,
steady
,
acute
*NL*
in
business
.
My
dear
sir
,
I
understand
your
present
feelings
against
*NL*
the
existing
state
of
things
,
which
I
grant
to
be
a
little
hard
in
*NL*
your
case
;
but
I
can
never
raise
my
voice
for
the
demolition
of
a
*NL*
class
of
men
like
Mr.
Vholes
.
''
The
respectability
of
Mr.
Vholes
has
*NL*
even
been
cited
with
crushing
effect
before
Parliamentary
committees
,
*NL*
as
in
the
following
blue
minutes
of
a
distinguished
attorney
's
*NL*
evidence
.
``
Question
-LRB-
number
five
hundred
and
seventeen
thousand
eight
*NL*
hundred
and
sixty-nine
-RRB-
:
If
I
understand
you
,
these
forms
of
practice
*NL*
indisputably
occasion
delay
?
Answer
:
Yes
,
some
delay
.
Question
:
And
*NL*
great
expense
?
Answer
:
Most
assuredly
they
can
not
be
gone
through
for
*NL*
nothing
.
Question
:
And
unspeakable
vexation
?
Answer
:
I
am
not
*NL*
prepared
to
say
that
.
They
have
never
given
ME
any
vexation
;
quite
*NL*
the
contrary
.
Question
:
But
you
think
that
their
abolition
would
*NL*
damage
a
class
of
practitioners
?
Answer
:
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
*NL*
Question
:
Can
you
instance
any
type
of
that
class
?
Answer
:
Yes
.
I
*NL*
would
unhesitatingly
mention
Mr.
Vholes
.
He
would
be
ruined
.
*NL*
Question
:
Mr.
Vholes
is
considered
,
in
the
profession
,
a
respectable
*NL*
man
?
Answer
:
''
--
which
proved
fatal
to
the
inquiry
for
ten
years
--
``
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
is
considered
,
in
the
profession
,
a
MOST
respectable
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
familiar
conversation
,
private
authorities
no
less
*NL*
disinterested
will
remark
that
they
do
n't
know
what
this
age
is
*NL*
coming
to
,
that
we
are
plunging
down
precipices
,
that
now
here
is
*NL*
something
else
gone
,
that
these
changes
are
death
to
people
like
*NL*
Vholes
--
a
man
of
undoubted
respectability
,
with
a
father
in
the
Vale
*NL*
of
Taunton
,
and
three
daughters
at
home
.
Take
a
few
steps
more
in
*NL*
this
direction
,
say
they
,
and
what
is
to
become
of
Vholes
's
father
?
*NL*
Is
he
to
perish
?
And
of
Vholes
's
daughters
?
Are
they
to
be
*NL*
shirt-makers
,
or
governesses
?
As
though
,
Mr.
Vholes
and
his
relations
*NL*
being
minor
cannibal
chiefs
and
it
being
proposed
to
abolish
*NL*
cannibalism
,
indignant
champions
were
to
put
the
case
thus
:
Make
*NL*
man-eating
unlawful
,
and
you
starve
the
Vholeses
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
Mr.
Vholes
,
with
his
three
daughters
and
his
father
in
the
*NL*
Vale
of
Taunton
,
is
continually
doing
duty
,
like
a
piece
of
timber
,
*NL*
to
shore
up
some
decayed
foundation
that
has
become
a
pitfall
and
a
*NL*
nuisance
.
And
with
a
great
many
people
in
a
great
many
instances
,
the
*NL*
question
is
never
one
of
a
change
from
wrong
to
right
-LRB-
which
is
quite
*NL*
an
extraneous
consideration
-RRB-
,
but
is
always
one
of
injury
or
*NL*
advantage
to
that
eminently
respectable
legion
,
Vholes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Chancellor
is
,
within
these
ten
minutes
,
``
up
''
for
the
long
*NL*
vacation
.
Mr.
Vholes
,
and
his
young
client
,
and
several
blue
bags
*NL*
hastily
stuffed
out
of
all
regularity
of
form
,
as
the
larger
sort
of
*NL*
serpents
are
in
their
first
gorged
state
,
have
returned
to
the
*NL*
official
den
.
Mr.
Vholes
,
quiet
and
unmoved
,
as
a
man
of
so
much
*NL*
respectability
ought
to
be

takes
off
his
close
black
gloves

were
skinning

lifts
off
his
tight
hat
as

scalping

and
sits
down
at

desk

The
client
throws
his
*NL*
hat
and
gloves
upon
the
ground
--
tosses
them
anywhere
,
without
looking
*NL*
after
them
or
caring
where
they
go
;
flings
himself
into
a
chair
,
half
*NL*
sighing
and
half
groaning
;
rests
his
aching
head
upon
his
hand
and
*NL*
looks
the
portrait
of
young
despair
.

That

Vholes

``
The

off

``
And
what

asks
the
moody
client
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vholes
,
sitting
with
his
arms
on
the
desk
,
quietly
bringing
the
tips

of
his
five
right
fingers
to
meet
the
tips
of
his
five
left
fingers
,
*NL*
and
quietly
separating
them
again
,

fixedly
and
slowly
looking
at

his

replies

the

rising
from

walking
about
the

down
again
with

beating

with
his

returns
Vholes

always
looking

is
enough
for
me
;
I
am
not
a
self-seeker

But
since
you
mention
me
so
*NL*
pointedly
,
I
will
acknowledge
that
I
should
like
to
impart
to
you
a
*NL*
little
of
my

come
,
sir
,
you
are
disposed
to
call
it
insensibility
,
*NL*
and
I
am
sure
I
have
no
objection

say
insensibility
--
a
little
of
my
*NL*
insensibility
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Vholes

explains
the
client
,
somewhat
abashed
,
``
I
had
no
*NL*
intention

accuse
you

``
I
think
you
had

without
knowing

returns
the
equable
*NL*
Vholes
.
``
Very
naturally

It
is
my
duty
to
attend
to
your

*NL*
with
a
cool
head

I
can
quite
understand
that
to
your
excited
*NL*
feelings
I
may
appear
,
at
such
times

the
present

insensible

My
*NL*
daughters
may
know
me
better
;
my
aged
father
may
know
me
better
.
But
*NL*
they
have
known
me
much
longer
than
you
have
,
and
the
confiding
eye
*NL*
of
affection
is
not
the
distrustful
eye
of
business

Not
that
I
*NL*
complain
,
sir

of
the
eye
of
business
being
distrustful
;
quite
the
*NL*
contrary

In
attending
to
your

I
wish
to
have
all
possible
*NL*
checks
upon
me
;
it
is
right
that
I
should
have
them

I
court
inquiry

*NL*
But
your

demand
that
I

methodical

Mr.

*NL*
Mr.

,
after
glancing
at
the
official
cat

is
patiently
*NL*
watching
a
mouse

hole

fixes
his
charmed
gaze
again
on
his
young
*NL*
client
and
proceeds
in
his
buttoned-up
,
half-audible
voice
as
if
*NL*
there
were
an
unclean
spirit
in
him
that
will
neither
come
out

speak
out

``
What
are
you

*NL*
Mr.

gives
it
a
rap

it
sounds
as
hollow
as

Not

Richard

There

``
Mr.

the
disinterested

three
words

three
raps

immovable
in

never
winking
his

I

I

me
the

I
will
not

I
never
stoop

bringing
us
together

this

mentioned
to
you

could
offer
no

advice

those

were
entrusted
to
another

I
spoke

such
terms

I
was
bound

*NL*
speak
of
Kenge

Carboy

office

which
stands
high

You
,

*NL*
thought
fit
to
withdraw
your
interests
from
that
keeping
nevertheless
*NL*

to
offer
them
to

You
brought
them
with
clean

accepted

My

*NL*
Vholes
finally
adds

by
way
of
rider
to
this
declaration

principles

that

Mr.

about

rejoin

*NL*
perhaps
Mr.

favour
him
with

twenty

*NL*
``
For

observes
Vholes

turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
diary

*NL*
``
and
these
things
mount
up

When
we
first
entered
on

stated
to

openly

it

openness

that
I

had
better
leave
your
*NL*
papers

No

Mr.

advantages

Vholes
gives
*NL*
the
desk
one
hollow
blow
again
,
``
is
your

it
pretends
to
be

nothing

*NL*
The
client
,
with
his
dejection
insensibly
relieved
and
his
vague
*NL*
hopes
rekindled
,
takes
pen
and
ink
and
writes
the
draft
,
not
without
*NL*
perplexed
consideration
and
calculation
of
the
date
it
may
bear
,
*NL*
implying
scant
effects
in
the
agent
's
hands
.
All
the
while
,
Vholes
,
*NL*
buttoned
up
in
body
and
mind
,
looks
at
him
attentively
.
All
the
*NL*
while
,
Vholes
's
official
cat
watches
the
mouse
's
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
the
client
,
shaking
hands
,
beseeches
Mr.
Vholes
,
for
heaven
's
*NL*
sake
and
earth
's
sake
,
to
do
his
utmost
to
``
pull
him
through

the
*NL*
Court
of
Chancery
.
Mr.
Vholes
,
who
never
gives
hopes
,
lays
his
palm
*NL*
upon
the
client
's
shoulder
and
answers
with
a
smile
,
``
Always

Thus
they
part
,
and
Vholes
,
left
*NL*
alone

employs
himself
in
carrying
sundry
little
matters
out
of
his

diary
into
his

book
for
the
ultimate
behoof
of
his

an
industrious
fox

make
up

an
eye
to
his

many
such
*NL*
loungers
have
the
speckled
shadows
of
those
trees
often
fallen
;
on
*NL*
the
like
bent
head
,
the
bitten
nail
,
the
lowering
eye
,
the
lingering
*NL*
step
,
the
purposeless
and
dreamy
air
,
the
good
consuming
and
*NL*
consumed
,
the
life
turned
sour
.
This
lounger
is
not
shabby
yet
,
but
*NL*
that
may
come
.
Chancery
,
which
knows
no
wisdom
but
in
precedent
,
is
*NL*
very
rich
in
such
precedents
;
and
why
should
one
be
different
from
*NL*
ten
thousand
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
time
is
so
short
since
his
depreciation
began
that
as
he
*NL*
saunters
away
,
reluctant
to
leave
the
spot
for
some
long
months
*NL*
together
,
though
he
hates
it
,
Richard
himself
may
feel
his
own
case
*NL*
as
if
it
were
a
startling
one
.
While
his
heart
is
heavy
with
*NL*
corroding
care
,
suspense
,
distrust
,
and
doubt
,
it
may
have
room
for
*NL*
some
sorrowful
wonder
when
he
recalls
how
different
his
first
visit
*NL*
there
,
how
different
he
,
how
different
all
the
colours
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
But
injustice
breeds
injustice
;
the
fighting
with
shadows
and
being
*NL*
defeated
by
them
necessitates
the
setting
up
of
substances
to
combat
;
*NL*
from
the
impalpable
suit
which
no
man
alive
can
understand
,
the
time
*NL*
for
that
being
long
gone
by
,
it
has
become
a
gloomy
relief
to
turn
to
*NL*
the
palpable
figure
of
the
friend
who
would
have
saved
him
from
this
*NL*
ruin
and
make
HIM
his
enemy
.
Richard
has
told
Vholes
the
truth
.
Is
he
*NL*
in
a
hardened
or
a
softened
mood
,
he
still
lays
his
injuries
equally
*NL*
at
that
door
;
he
was
thwarted
,
in
that
quarter
,
of
a
set
purpose
,
and
*NL*
that
purpose
could
only
originate
in
the
one
subject
that
is
*NL*
resolving
his
existence
into
itself
;
besides
,
it
is
a
justification
*NL*
to
him
in
his
own
eyes
to
have
an
embodied
antagonist
and
oppressor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
Richard
a
monster
in
all
this
,
or
would
Chancery
be
found
rich
in
*NL*
such
precedents
too
if
they
could
be
got
for
citation
from
the
*NL*
Recording
Angel
?
*NL*
*NL*
Two
pairs
of
eyes
not
unused
to
such
people
look
after
him
,
as
,
*NL*
biting
his
nails
and
brooding
,
he
crosses
the
square
and
is
swallowed
*NL*
up
by
the
shadow
of
the
southern
gateway
.
Mr.
Guppy
and
Mr.
Weevle
*NL*
are
the
possessors
of
those
eyes
,
and
they
have
been
leaning
in
*NL*
conversation
against
the
low
stone
parapet
under
the
trees
.
He
passes
*NL*
close
by
them
,
seeing
nothing
but
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Mr.
Weevle
,
adjusting
his
whiskers
,
``
there
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

says
Mr.

``

I
never

He

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
refolding
his

resettles
himself
against
the

as
resuming

*NL*
``

Mr.

eloquent

more

in

he
put
those
letters
away

saw
him
alive

that

night

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

reflects
for
some
time

Shakes
his
head

Decidedly
thinks
*NL*
not

*NL*
*NL*
``

says
Mr.

as
they
walk
towards
the

``
once
again

Without
entering
into
further

I

repeat
that
the

is
down

I
have
no
purpose

burial

To
that
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
nods
.
Mr.
Guppy
,
much
elevated
in
his
own
opinion
by
*NL*
having
delivered
these
observations
,
with
an
air
in
part
forensic
and
*NL*
in
part
romantic
--
this
gentleman
having
a
passion
for
conducting
*NL*
anything
in
the
form
of
an
examination
,
or
delivering
anything
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
summing
up
or
a
speech
--
accompanies
his
friend
with
dignity
*NL*
to
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
since
it
has
been
a
court
has
it
had
such
a
Fortunatus
'
purse
*NL*
of
gossip
as
in
the
proceedings
at
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
.
*NL*
Regularly
,
every
morning
at
eight
,
is
the
elder
Mr.
Smallweed
brought
*NL*
down
to
the
corner
and
carried
in
,
accompanied
by
Mrs.
Smallweed
,
*NL*
Judy
,
and
Bart
;
and
regularly
,
all
day
,
do
they
all
remain
there
*NL*
until
nine
at
night
,
solaced
by
gipsy
dinners
,
not
abundant
in
*NL*
quantity
,
from
the
cook
's
shop
,
rummaging
and
searching
,
digging
,
*NL*
delving
,
and
diving
among
the
treasures
of
the
late
lamented
.
What
*NL*
those
treasures
are
they
keep
so
secret
that
the
court
is
maddened
.
*NL*
In
its
delirium
it
imagines
guineas
pouring
out
of
tea-pots
,
*NL*
crown-pieces
overflowing
punch-bowls
,
old
chairs
and
mattresses
*NL*
stuffed
with
Bank
of
England
notes
.
It
possesses
itself
of
the
*NL*
sixpenny
history
-LRB-
with
highly
coloured
folding
frontispiece
-RRB-
of
Mr.
*NL*
Daniel
Dancer
and
his
sister
,
and
also
of
Mr.
Elwes
,
of
Suffolk
,
and
*NL*
transfers
all
the
facts
from
those
authentic
narratives
to
Mr.
Krook
.
*NL*
Twice
when
the
dustman
is
called
in
to
carry
off
a
cartload
of
old
*NL*
paper
,
ashes
,
and
broken
bottles
,
the
whole
court
assembles
and
pries
*NL*
into
the
baskets
as
they
come
forth
.
Many
times
the
two
gentlemen
who
*NL*
write
with
the
ravenous
little
pens
on
the
tissue-paper
are
seen
*NL*
prowling
in
the
neighbourhood
--
shy
of
each
other
,
their
late
*NL*
partnership
being
dissolved
.
The
Sol
skilfully
carries
a
vein
of
the
*NL*
prevailing
interest
through
the
Harmonic
nights
.
Little
Swills
,
in
*NL*
what
are
professionally
known
as
``
patter
''
allusions
to
the
subject
,
*NL*
is
received
with
loud
applause
;
and
the
same
vocalist
``
gags
''
in
the
*NL*
regular
business
like
a
man
inspired
.
Even
Miss
M.
Melvilleson
,
in
*NL*
the
revived
Caledonian
melody
of
``
We
're
a-Nodding
,
''
points
the
*NL*
sentiment
that
``
the
dogs
love
broo
''
-LRB-
whatever
the
nature
of
that
*NL*
refreshment
may
be
-RRB-
with
such
archness
and
such
a
turn
of
the
head
*NL*
towards
next
door
that
she
is
immediately
understood
to
mean
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
loves
to
find
money
,
and
is
nightly
honoured
with
a
double
*NL*
encore
.
For
all
this
,
the
court
discovers
nothing
;
and
as
Mrs.
Piper
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Perkins
now
communicate
to
the
late
lodger
whose
appearance
*NL*
is
the
signal
for
a
general
rally
,
it
is
in
one
continual
ferment
to
*NL*
discover
everything
,
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
and
Mr.
Guppy
,
with
every
eye
in
the
court
's
head
upon
*NL*
them
,
knock
at
the
closed
door
of
the
late
lamented
's
house
,
in
a
*NL*
high
state
of
popularity
.
But
being
contrary
to
the
court
's
*NL*
expectation
admitted
,
they
immediately
become
unpopular
and
are
*NL*
considered
to
mean
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shutters
are
more
or
less
closed
all
over
the
house
,
and
the
*NL*
ground-floor
is
sufficiently
dark
to
require
candles
.
Introduced
into
*NL*
the
back
shop
by
Mr.
Smallweed
the
younger
,
they
,
fresh
from
the
*NL*
sunlight
,
can
at
first
see
nothing
save
darkness
and
shadows
;
but
*NL*
they
gradually
discern
the
elder
Mr.
Smallweed
seated
in
his
chair
*NL*
upon
the
brink
of
a
well
or
grave
of
waste-paper
,
the
virtuous
Judy
*NL*
groping
therein
like
a
female
sexton
,
and
Mrs.
Smallweed
on
the
level
*NL*
ground
in
the
vicinity
snowed
up
in
a
heap
of
paper
fragments
,
print
,
*NL*
and
manuscript
which
would
appear
to
be
the
accumulated
compliments
*NL*
that
have
been
sent
flying
at
her
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
The
whole
*NL*
party
,
Small
included
,
are
blackened
with
dust
and
dirt
and
present
a
*NL*
fiendish
appearance
not
relieved
by
the
general
aspect
of
the
room
.
*NL*
There
is
more
litter
and
lumber
in
it
than
of
old
,
and
it
is
dirtier
*NL*
if
possible
;
likewise
,
it
is
ghostly
with
traces
of
its
dead
*NL*
inhabitant
and
even
with
his
chalked
writing
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
entrance
of
visitors
,
Mr.
Smallweed
and
Judy
simultaneously
*NL*
fold
their
arms
and
stop
in
their
researches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha

croaks
the
old

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
thanking
him
,
casts
an
eye
about

Mr.

's
eye
follows
*NL*
Mr.
Weevle
's
eye

Mr.

eye
comes
back
without
any

intelligence
in
it

Mr.
Guppy
's
eye
comes
back
and
meets
Mr.

Smallweed

eye

That
engaging
old
gentleman
is
still
murmuring
,
like
*NL*
some
wound-up
instrument
running
down
,
``
How
de
do
,
sir
--
how
*NL*
de

how

''
And
then
having
run
down
,
he
lapses
into
grinning
silence
,
*NL*
as
Mr.
Guppy
starts
at
seeing
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
standing
in
the
*NL*
darkness
opposite
with
his
hands
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

kind

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
,
slightly
nudging
his
friend
to
take
another
look
,
makes
a
*NL*
shuffling
bow
to
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
who
returns
it
with
an
easy
nod
.
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
is
looking
on
as
if
he
had
nothing
else
to
do

were
rather
amused
by
the
novelty

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
As
they
go
upstairs
,
Mr.
Guppy
lifts
his
eyebrows
inquiringly
and
*NL*
looks
at
Tony
.
Tony
shakes
his
head
.
They
find
the
old
room
very
dull
*NL*
and
dismal
,
with
the
ashes
of
the
fire
that
was
burning
on
that
*NL*
memorable
night
yet
in
the
discoloured
grate
.
They
have
a
great
*NL*
disinclination
to
touch
any
object
,
and
carefully
blow
the
dust
from
*NL*
it
first
.
Nor
are
they
desirous
to
prolong
their
visit
,
packing
the
*NL*
few
movables
with
all
possible
speed
and
never
speaking
above
a
*NL*
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
says
Tony
,
recoiling
.
``
Here
's
that
horrible
cat
coming
*NL*
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
retreats
behind
a
chair
.
``
Small
told
me
of
her
.
She
went
*NL*
leaping
and
bounding
and
tearing
about
that
night
like
a
dragon
,
and
*NL*
got
out
on
the
house-top
,
and
roamed
about
up
there
for
a
fortnight
,
*NL*
and
then
came
tumbling
down
the
chimney
very
thin
.
Did
you
ever
see
*NL*
such
a
brute
?
Looks
as
if
she
knew
all
about
it
,
do
n't
she
?
Almost
*NL*
looks
as

she
was
Krook

Shoohoo

Get
out

you
goblin

*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Jane
,
in
the
doorway
,
with
her
tiger
snarl
from
ear
to
ear
and
*NL*
her
club
of
a
tail
,
shows
no
intention
of
obeying

but
Mr.

Tulkinghorn
stumbling
over
her
,
she
spits
at
his
rusty
legs

and
*NL*
swearing
wrathfully
,
takes
her
arched
back
upstairs

Possibly
to
roam
*NL*
the
house-tops
again
and
return
by
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
``
could
I
have

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
is
engaged
in
collecting
the
Galaxy
Gallery
of
British
*NL*
Beauty
from
the
wall
and
depositing
those
works
of
art
in
their
old
*NL*
ignoble
band-box

``
Sir

he
returns

reddening
,

Mr.

I
must
stipulate

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``
No

Mr.

is
as
imperturbable

has
quietly
walked

He
pauses
here
to

his

is

rusty

*NL*
Mr.

,
looking

give
his

still
*NL*
reddening

be
one

those

at

replies
,
``

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
He
addresses
this
to
the
astounded
Tony

who
admits
the
soft
*NL*
impeachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
virtue

observes
Mr.

He
has
been
standing
on
the
hearthstone
with
his
back
to
*NL*
the
smoked
chimney-piece

and
now
turns
round
with
his
glasses
to
his

eyes

*NL*
*NL*
When
he
has
walked
out
,
Mr.
Guppy
,
in
a
great
perspiration
,
nerves
*NL*
himself
to
the
hasty
completion
of
the
taking
down
of
the
Galaxy
*NL*
Gallery
,
concluding
with
Lady
Dedlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tony

he
says
hurriedly
to
his
astonished
companion
,
``
let
us
be
*NL*
quick
in
putting
the
things
together

in
getting
out

It
were
in

longer
to
conceal
from
you

that
between

one
of

members

swan-like
aristocracy
whom
I
now

*NL*
*NL*
This
charge
Mr.
Guppy
delivers
in
a
state
little
short
of
forensic
*NL*
lunacy
,

shows
a
dazed

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
National
and
Domestic
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
England
has
been
in
a
dreadful
state
for
some
weeks
.
Lord
Coodle
*NL*
would
go
out
,
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
would
n't
come
in
,
and
there
being
*NL*
nobody
in
Great
Britain
-LRB-
to
speak
of
-RRB-
except
Coodle
and
Doodle
,
there
*NL*
has
been
no
government
.
It
is
a
mercy
that
the
hostile
meeting
*NL*
between
those
two
great
men
,
which
at
one
time
seemed
inevitable
,
did
*NL*
not
come
off
,
because
if
both
pistols
had
taken
effect
,
and
Coodle
*NL*
and
Doodle
had
killed
each
other
,
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
England
*NL*
must
have
waited
to
be
governed
until
young
Coodle
and
young
Doodle
,
*NL*
now
in
frocks
and
long
stockings
,
were
grown
up
.
This
stupendous
*NL*
national
calamity
,
however
,
was
averted
by
Lord
Coodle
's
making
the
*NL*
timely
discovery
that
if
in
the
heat
of
debate
he
had
said
that
he
*NL*
scorned
and
despised
the
whole
ignoble
career
of
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
,
*NL*
he
had
merely
meant
to
say
that
party
differences
should
never
induce
*NL*
him
to
withhold
from
it
the
tribute
of
his
warmest
admiration
;
while
*NL*
it
as
opportunely
turned
out
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
Doodle
had
in
his
own
bosom
expressly
booked
Lord
Coodle
to
go
down
*NL*
to
posterity
as
the
mirror
of
virtue
and
honour
.
Still
England
has
*NL*
been
some
weeks
in
the
dismal
strait
of
having
no
pilot
-LRB-
as
was
well
*NL*
observed
by
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
-RRB-
to
weather
the
storm
;
and
the
*NL*
marvellous
part
of
the
matter
is
that
England
has
not
appeared
to
*NL*
care
very
much
about
it
,
but
has
gone
on
eating
and
drinking
and
*NL*
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
as
the
old
world
did
in
the
days
*NL*
before
the
flood
.
But
Coodle
knew
the
danger
,
and
Doodle
knew
the
*NL*
danger
,
and
all
their
followers
and
hangers-on
had
the
clearest
*NL*
possible
perception
of
the
danger
.
At
last
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
has
not
*NL*
only
condescended
to
come
in
,
but
has
done
it
handsomely
,
bringing
in
*NL*
with
him
all
his
nephews
,
all
his
male
cousins
,
and
all
his
*NL*
brothers-in-law
.
So
there
is
hope
for
the
old
ship
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doodle
has
found
that
he
must
throw
himself
upon
the
country
,
chiefly
*NL*
in
the
form
of
sovereigns
and
beer
.
In
this
metamorphosed
state
he
is
*NL*
available
in
a
good
many
places
simultaneously
and
can
throw
himself
*NL*
upon
a
considerable
portion
of
the
country
at
one
time
.
Britannia
*NL*
being
much
occupied
in
pocketing
Doodle
in
the
form
of
sovereigns
,
*NL*
and
swallowing
Doodle
in
the
form
of
beer
,
and
in
swearing
herself
*NL*
black
in
the
face
that
she
does
neither
--
plainly
to
the
advancement
*NL*
of
her
glory
and
morality
--
the
London
season
comes
to
a
sudden
end
,
*NL*
through
all
the
Doodleites
and
Coodleites
dispersing
to
assist
*NL*
Britannia
in
those
religious
exercises
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
housekeeper
at
Chesney
Wold
,
foresees
,
though
*NL*
no
instructions
have
yet
come
down
,
that
the
family
may
shortly
be
*NL*
expected
,
together
with
a
pretty
large
accession
of
cousins
and
*NL*
others
who
can
in
any
way
assist
the
great
Constitutional
work
.
And
*NL*
hence
the
stately
old
dame
,
taking
Time
by
the
forelock
,
leads
him
up
*NL*
and
down
the
staircases
,
and
along
the
galleries
and
passages
,
and
*NL*
through
the
rooms
,
to
witness
before
he
grows
any
older
that
*NL*
everything
is
ready
,
that
floors
are
rubbed
bright
,
carpets
spread
,
*NL*
curtains
shaken
out
,
beds
puffed
and
patted
,
still-room
and
kitchen
*NL*
cleared
for
action
--
all
things
prepared
as
beseems
the
Dedlock
*NL*
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
present
summer
evening
,
as
the
sun
goes
down
,
the
preparations
*NL*
are
complete
.
Dreary
and
solemn
the
old
house
looks
,
with
so
many
*NL*
appliances
of
habitation
and
with
no
inhabitants
except
the
pictured
*NL*
forms
upon
the
walls
.
So
did
these
come
and
go
,
a
Dedlock
in
*NL*
possession
might
have
ruminated
passing
along
;
so
did
they
see
this
*NL*
gallery
hushed
and
quiet
,
as
I
see
it
now
;
so
think
,
as
I
think
,
of
*NL*
the
gap
that
they
would
make
in
this
domain
when
they
were
gone
;
so
*NL*
find
it
,
as
I
find
it
,
difficult
to
believe
that
it
could
be
without
*NL*
them
;
so
pass
from
my
world
,
as
I
pass
from
theirs
,
now
closing
the
*NL*
reverberating
door
;
so
leave
no
blank
to
miss
them
,
and
so
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
some
of
the
fiery
windows
beautiful
from
without
,
and
set
,
at
*NL*
this
sunset
hour
,
not
in
dull-grey
stone
but
in
a
glorious
house
of
*NL*
gold
,
the
light
excluded
at
other
windows
pours
in
rich
,
lavish
,
*NL*
overflowing
like
the
summer
plenty
in
the
land
.
Then
do
the
frozen
*NL*
Dedlocks
thaw
.
Strange
movements
come
upon
their
features
as
the
*NL*
shadows
of
leaves
play
there
.
A
dense
justice
in
a
corner
is
beguiled
*NL*
into
a
wink
.
A
staring
baronet
,
with
a
truncheon
,
gets
a
dimple
in
*NL*
his
chin
.
Down
into
the
bosom
of
a
stony
shepherdess
there
steals
a
*NL*
fleck
of
light
and
warmth
that
would
have
done
it
good
a
hundred
*NL*
years
ago
.
One
ancestress
of
Volumnia
,
in
high-heeled
shoes
,
very
*NL*
like
her
--
casting
the
shadow
of
that
virgin
event
before
her
full
two
*NL*
centuries
--
shoots
out
into
a
halo
and
becomes
a
saint
.
A
maid
of
*NL*
honour
of
the
court
of
Charles
the
Second
,
with
large
round
eyes
-LRB-
and
*NL*
other
charms
to
correspond
-RRB-
,
seems
to
bathe
in
glowing
water
,
and
it
*NL*
ripples
as
it
glows
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
fire
of
the
sun
is
dying
.
Even
now
the
floor
is
dusky
,
and
*NL*
shadow
slowly
mounts
the
walls
,
bringing
the
Dedlocks
down
like
age
*NL*
and
death
.
And
now
,
upon
my
Lady
's
picture
over
the
great
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
a
weird
shade
falls
from
some
old
tree
,
that
turns
it
*NL*
pale
,
and
flutters
it
,
and
looks
as
if
a
great
arm
held
a
veil
or
*NL*
hood
,
watching
an
opportunity
to
draw
it
over
her
.
Higher
and
darker
*NL*
rises
shadow
on
the
wall
--
now
a
red
gloom
on
the
ceiling
--
now
the
*NL*
fire
is
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
prospect
,
which
from
the
terrace
looked
so
near
,
has
moved
*NL*
solemnly
away
and
changed
--
not
the
first
nor
the
last
of
beautiful
*NL*
things
that
look
so
near
and
will
so
change
--
into
a
distant
phantom
.
*NL*
Light
mists
arise
,
and
the
dew
falls
,
and
all
the
sweet
scents
in
the
*NL*
garden
are
heavy
in
the
air
.
Now
the
woods
settle
into
great
masses
*NL*
as
if
they
were
each
one
profound
tree
.
And
now
the
moon
rises
to
*NL*
separate
them
,
and
to
glimmer
here
and
there
in
horizontal
lines
*NL*
behind
their
stems
,
and
to
make
the
avenue
a
pavement
of
light
among
*NL*
high
cathedral
arches
fantastically
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
moon
is
high
;
and
the
great
house
,
needing
habitation
more
*NL*
than
ever
,
is
like
a
body
without
life
.
Now
it
is
even
awful
,
*NL*
stealing
through
it
,
to
think
of
the
live
people
who
have
slept
in
*NL*
the
solitary
bedrooms
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
dead
.
Now
is
the
time
*NL*
for
shadow
,
when
every
corner
is
a
cavern
and
every
downward
step
a
*NL*
pit
,
when
the
stained
glass
is
reflected
in
pale
and
faded
hues
upon
*NL*
the
floors
,
when
anything
and
everything
can
be
made
of
the
heavy
*NL*
staircase
beams
excepting
their
own
proper
shapes
,
when
the
armour
*NL*
has
dull
lights
upon
it
not
easily
to
be
distinguished
from
stealthy
*NL*
movement
,
and
when
barred
helmets
are
frightfully
suggestive
of
heads
*NL*
inside
.
But
of
all
the
shadows
in
Chesney
Wold
,
the
shadow
in
the
*NL*
long
drawing-room
upon
my
Lady
's
picture
is
the
first
to
come
,
the
*NL*
last
to
be
disturbed
.
At
this
hour
and
by
this
light
it
changes
into
*NL*
threatening
hands
raised
up
and
menacing
the
handsome
face
with
every
*NL*
breath
that
stirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
well
,
ma'am
,
''
says
a
groom
in
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
*NL*
audience-chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lady
not
well
!
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
Lady
has
been
but
poorly
,
ma'am
,
since
she
was
last
here
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
with
the
family
,
ma'am
,
but
when
she
was
here
as
a
bird
of
*NL*
passage
like
.
My
Lady
has
not
been
out
much
,
for
her
,
and
has
kept
*NL*
her
room
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chesney
Wold
,
Thomas
,
''
rejoins
the
housekeeper
with
proud
*NL*
complacency
,
``
will
set
my
Lady
up
!
There
is
no
finer
air
and
no
*NL*
healthier
soil
in
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
may
have
his
own
personal
opinions
on
this
subject
,
probably
*NL*
hints
them
in
his
manner
of
smoothing
his
sleek
head
from
the
nape
of
*NL*
his
neck
to
his
temples
,
but
he
forbears
to
express
them
further
and
*NL*
retires
to
the
servants
'
hall
to
regale
on
cold
meat-pie
and
ale
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
groom
is
the
pilot-fish
before
the
nobler
shark
.
Next
evening
,
*NL*
down
come
Sir
Leicester
and
my
Lady
with
their
largest
retinue
,
and
*NL*
down
come
the
cousins
and
others
from
all
the
points
of
the
compass
.
*NL*
Thenceforth
for
some
weeks
backward
and
forward
rush
mysterious
men
*NL*
with
no
names
,
who
fly
about
all
those
particular
parts
of
the
*NL*
country
on
which
Doodle
is
at
present
throwing
himself
in
an
*NL*
auriferous
and
malty
shower
,
but
who
are
merely
persons
of
a
restless
*NL*
disposition
and
never
do
anything
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
these
national
occasions
Sir
Leicester
finds
the
cousins
useful
.
A
*NL*
better
man
than
the
Honourable
Bob
Stables
to
meet
the
Hunt
at
*NL*
dinner
,
there
could
not
possibly
be
.
Better
got
up
gentlemen
than
the
*NL*
other
cousins
to
ride
over
to
polling-booths
and
hustings
here
and
*NL*
there
,
and
show
themselves
on
the
side
of
England
,
it
would
be
hard
*NL*
to
find
.
Volumnia
is
a
little
dim
,
but
she
is
of
the
true
descent
;
*NL*
and
there
are
many
who
appreciate
her
sprightly
conversation
,
her
*NL*
French
conundrums
so
old
as
to
have
become
in
the
cycles
of
time
*NL*
almost
new
again
,
the
honour
of
taking
the
fair
Dedlock
in
to
dinner
,
*NL*
or
even
the
privilege
of
her
hand
in
the
dance
.
On
these
national
*NL*
occasions
dancing
may
be
a
patriotic
service
,
and
Volumnia
is
*NL*
constantly
seen
hopping
about
for
the
good
of
an
ungrateful
and
*NL*
unpensioning
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
takes
no
great
pains
to
entertain
the
numerous
guests
,
and
*NL*
being
still
unwell
,
rarely
appears
until
late
in
the
day
.
But
at
all
*NL*
the
dismal
dinners
,
leaden
lunches
,
basilisk
balls
,
and
other
*NL*
melancholy
pageants
,
her
mere
appearance
is
a
relief
.
As
to
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
,
he
conceives
it
utterly
impossible
that
anything
can
be
*NL*
wanting
,
in
any
direction
,
by
any
one
who
has
the
good
fortune
to
be
*NL*
received
under
that
roof
;
and
in
a
state
of
sublime
satisfaction
,
he
*NL*
moves
among
the
company
,
a
magnificent
refrigerator
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daily
the
cousins
trot
through
dust
and
canter
over
roadside
turf
,
*NL*
away
to
hustings
and
polling-booths
-LRB-
with
leather
gloves
and
*NL*
hunting-whips
for
the
counties
and
kid
gloves
and
riding-canes
for
*NL*
the
boroughs
-RRB-
,
and
daily
bring
back
reports
on
which
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
holds
forth
after
dinner
.
Daily
the
restless
men
who
have
no
*NL*
occupation
in
life
present
the
appearance
of
being
rather
busy
.
Daily
*NL*
Volumnia
has
a
little
cousinly
talk
with
Sir
Leicester
on
the
state
*NL*
of
the
nation
,
from
which
Sir
Leicester
is
disposed
to
conclude
that
*NL*
Volumnia
is
a
more
reflecting
woman
than
he
had
thought
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
we
getting
on
?
''
says
Miss
Volumnia
,
clasping
her
hands
.
``
ARE
*NL*
we
safe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mighty
business
is
nearly
over
by
this
time
,
and
Doodle
will
*NL*
throw
himself
off
the
country
in
a
few
days
more
.
Sir
Leicester
has
*NL*
just
appeared
in
the
long
drawing-room
after
dinner
,
a
bright
*NL*
particular
star
surrounded
by
clouds
of
cousins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Volumnia
,
''
replies
Sir
Leicester
,
who
has
a
list
in
his
hand
,
``
we
*NL*
are
doing
tolerably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
tolerably
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
it
is
summer
weather
,
Sir
Leicester
always
has
his
own
*NL*
particular
fire
in
the
evening
.
He
takes
his
usual
screened
seat
near
*NL*
it
and
repeats
with
much
firmness
and
a
little
displeasure
,
as
who
*NL*
should
say
,
I
am
not
a
common
man
,
and
when
I
say
tolerably
,
it
must
*NL*
not
be
understood
as
a
common
expression
,
``
Volumnia
,
we
are
doing
*NL*
tolerably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
there
is
no
opposition
to
YOU
,
''
Volumnia
asserts
with
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Volumnia
.
This
distracted
country
has
lost
its
senses
in
many
*NL*
respects
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
so
mad
as
that
.
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
's
finishing
the
sentence
restores
her
to
favour
.
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
,
with
a
gracious
inclination
of
his
head
,
seems
to
say
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
A
sensible
woman
this
,
on
the
whole
,
though
occasionally
*NL*
precipitate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
as
to
this
question
of
opposition
,
the
fair
Dedlock
's
*NL*
observation
was
superfluous
,
Sir
Leicester
on
these
occasions
always
*NL*
delivering
in
his
own
candidateship
,
as
a
kind
of
handsome
wholesale
*NL*
order
to
be
promptly
executed
.
Two
other
little
seats
that
belong
to
*NL*
him
he
treats
as
retail
orders
of
less
importance
,
merely
sending
*NL*
down
the
men
and
signifying
to
the
tradespeople
,
``
You
will
have
the
*NL*
goodness
to
make
these
materials
into
two
members
of
Parliament
and
*NL*
to
send
them
home
when
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
regret
to
say
,
Volumnia
,
that
in
many
places
the
people
have
shown
*NL*
a
bad
spirit
,
and
that
this
opposition
to
the
government
has
been
of
*NL*
a
most
determined
and
most
implacable
description
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
W-r-retches
!
''
says
Volumnia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
,
''
proceeds
Sir
Leicester
,
glancing
at
the
circumjacent
cousins
*NL*
on
sofas
and
ottomans
,
``
even
in
many
--
in
fact
,
in
most

of
those
*NL*
places
in
which
the
government
has
carried
it
against
a
faction
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Note
,
by
the
way
,
that
the
Coodleites
are
always
a
faction
with
the
*NL*
Doodleites
,
and
that
the
Doodleites
occupy
exactly
the
same
position
*NL*
towards
the
Coodleites

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Even
in
them
I
am
shocked
,
for
the
credit
of
Englishmen
,
to
be
*NL*
constrained
to
inform
you
that
the
party
has
not
triumphed
without
*NL*
being
put
to
an
enormous
expense
.
Hundreds
,
''
says
Sir
Leicester
,
*NL*
eyeing
the
cousins
with
increasing
dignity
and
swelling
indignation
,
*NL*
``
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Volumnia
have
a
fault
,
it
is
the
fault
of
being
a
trifle
too
*NL*
innocent
,
seeing
that
the
innocence
which
would
go
extremely
well
*NL*
with
a
sash
and
tucker
is
a
little
out
of
keeping
with
the
rouge
and
*NL*
pearl
necklace
.
Howbeit
,
impelled
by
innocence
,
she
asks
,
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Volumnia
,
''
remonstrates
Sir
Leicester
with
his
utmost
severity
.
*NL*
``
Volumnia
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

I
do
n't
mean
what
for

cries
Volumnia
with
her
favourite
*NL*
little
scream
.
``
How
stupid
I
am
!
I
mean
what
a
pity

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad

''
returns
Sir
Leicester
,
``
that
you
do
mean
what

''
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
hastens
to
express
her
opinion
that
the
shocking
people
*NL*
ought
to
be
tried
as
traitors
and
made
to
support
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad

Volumnia
,

repeats
Sir
Leicester
,
unmindful
of
these
*NL*
mollifying
sentiments
,
``
that
you
do
mean
what
a

disgraceful

unreasonable
a

expenses

I
trust

your
good

sense

not
to
pursue
the
subject

here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
feels
it
incumbent
on
him
to
observe
a
crushing
aspect
*NL*
towards
Volumnia
because
it
is
whispered
abroad
that
these
necessary
*NL*
expenses
will
,
in
some
two
hundred
election
petitions
,
be
*NL*
unpleasantly
connected
with
the
word
bribery
,
and
because
some
*NL*
graceless
jokers
have
consequently
suggested
the
omission
from
the
*NL*
Church
service
of
the
ordinary
supplication
in
behalf
of
the
High
*NL*
Court
of
Parliament
and
have
recommended
instead
that
the
prayers
of
*NL*
the
congregation
be
requested
for
six
hundred
and
fifty-eight
*NL*
gentlemen
in
a
very
unhealthy
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose

''
observes
Volumnia
,
having
taken
a
little
time
to
recover
*NL*
her
spirits
after
her
late
castigation
,
``
I
suppose
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
has
been
worked
to
death

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

says
Sir
Leicester
,
opening
his
eyes
,
``
why
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
should
be
worked
to

I
do
n't
know
what
Mr.

Tulkinghorn
's
engagements
may
be

He
is
not
a
candidate

''
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
had
thought
he
might
have
been
employed
.
Sir
Leicester
could
*NL*
desire
to
know
by
whom
,
and
what
for
.
Volumnia
,
abashed
again
,
*NL*
suggests
,
by
somebody
--
to
advise
and
make
arrangements
.
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
is
not
aware
that
any
client
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
has
been
in
need
of
*NL*
his
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
,
seated
at
an
open
window
with
her
arm
upon
its
*NL*
cushioned
ledge
and
looking
out
at
the
evening
shadows
falling
on
the
*NL*
park
,
has
seemed
to
attend
since
the
lawyer
's
name
was
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
languid
cousin
with
a
moustache
in
a
state
of
extreme
debility
now
*NL*
observes
from
his
couch
that
man
told
him
ya'as
`
dy
that
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
had
gone
down
t
'
that
iron
place
t

give
legal
`

`
bout
*NL*
something
,
and
that
contest
being
over
t

day
,
`
twould
be
highly
*NL*
jawlly
thing
if
Tulkinghorn
should
`
pear
with
news
that
Coodle
man
*NL*
was
floored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercury
in
attendance
with
coffee
informs
Sir
Leicester
,
hereupon
,
*NL*
that
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
has
arrived
and
is
taking
dinner
.
My
Lady
turns
*NL*
her
head
inward
for
the
moment
,
then
looks
out
again
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
is
charmed
to
hear
that
her
delight
is
come
.
He
is
so
*NL*
original
,
such
a
stolid
creature
,
such
an
immense
being
for
knowing
*NL*
all
sorts
of
things
and
never
telling
them
!
Volumnia
is
persuaded
*NL*
that
he
must
be
a
Freemason
.
Is
sure
he
is
at
the
head
of
a
lodge
,
*NL*
and
wears
short
aprons
,
and
is
made
a
perfect
idol
of
with
*NL*
candlesticks
and
trowels
.
These
lively
remarks
the
fair
Dedlock
*NL*
delivers
in
her
youthful
manner
,
while
making
a
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
not
been
here
once

''
she
adds
,
``
since
I
came

I
really
had
*NL*
some
thoughts

almost
made
up
my

It
may
be
the
gathering
gloom

evening

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
with
his
usual
leisurely
ease
advances
,
renders
his
*NL*
passing
homage
to
my
Lady
,
shakes
Sir
Leicester
's
hand
,
and
subsides
*NL*
into
the
chair
proper
to
him
when
he
has
anything
to
communicate
,
on
*NL*
the
opposite
side
of
the
Baronet
's
little
newspaper-table
.
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
is
apprehensive
that
my
Lady
,
not
being
very
well
,
will
*NL*
take
cold
at
that
open
window
.
My
Lady
is
obliged
to
him
,
but
would
*NL*
rather
sit
there
for
the
air
.
Sir
Leicester
rises
,
adjusts
her
scarf
*NL*
about
her
,
and
returns
to
his
seat
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
in
the
meanwhile
*NL*
takes
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
part
of
Mr.

policy

mastery
to
have
no

NO

again

It

staring
majestically

``

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

not
my

returns
Sir

``
I
am
glad
to
hear

so

I
would
suggest

you
should
exert
your
influence
to
keep

you

out

Sir

after
a
moment
's
consideration

*NL*
``
dragged

*NL*
These
remarks
he
offers
with
his
unvarying
politeness
and
deference
*NL*
when
he
addresses
himself
to
his

She
merely
moves
her
head
in

reply

The
moon
is
rising

where
she
sits
there
is
a
little

stream

cold

light

her
head
is
seen

``

A

Mrs.

a

in

I
am
told

had
the
good
fortune
to
have
a
daughter
*NL*
who
attracted
the
notice
of
a
great
lady

I
speak
of
really
a
great

lady
,
not
merely
great
to

but
married
to
a
gentleman
of

condition

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

condescendingly
says
,
``
Yes

Mr.

''
implying
*NL*
that
then
she
must
have
appeared
of
very
considerable
moral
*NL*
dimensions
indeed
in
the
eyes
of
an
iron-master

The

beautiful

had

treated

with
great
kindness

kept

always
near
her

Now
this
lady
preserved
a
secret
under
all
her
greatness
,
which
she
*NL*
had
preserved
for
many
years
.
In
fact
,
she
had
in
early
life
been
*NL*
engaged
to
marry
a
young
rake
--
he
was
a
captain
in
the
army
--
nothing
*NL*
connected
with
whom
came
to
any
good
.
She
never
did
marry
him
,
but
*NL*
she
gave
birth
to
a
child
of
which
he
was
the
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
light
of
the
fire
he
can
be
seen
looking
towards
the
*NL*
moonlight
.
By
the
moonlight
,
Lady
Dedlock
can
be
seen
in
profile
,
*NL*
perfectly
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
captain
in
the
army
being
dead
,
she
believed
herself
safe
;
but
a
*NL*
train
of
circumstances
with
which
I
need
not
trouble
you
led
to
*NL*
discovery
.
As
I
received
the
story
,
they
began
in
an
imprudence
on
*NL*
her
own
part
one
day
when
she
was
taken
by
surprise
,
which
shows
how
*NL*
difficult
it
is
for
the
firmest
of
us
-LRB-
she
was
very
firm
-RRB-
to
be
*NL*
always
guarded
.
There
was
great
domestic
trouble
and
amazement
,
you
*NL*
may
suppose
;
I
leave
you
to
imagine
,
Sir
Leicester
,
the
husband
's
*NL*
grief
.
But
that
is
not
the
present
point
.
When
Mr.
Rouncewell
's
*NL*
townsman
heard
of
the
disclosure
,
he
no
more
allowed
the
girl
to
be
*NL*
patronized
and
honoured
than
he
would
have
suffered
her
to
be
trodden
*NL*
underfoot
before
his
eyes
.
Such
was
his
pride
,
that
he
indignantly
*NL*
took
her
away
,
as
if
from
reproach
and
disgrace
.
He
had
no
sense
of
*NL*
the
honour
done
him
and
his
daughter
by
the
lady
's
condescension
;
not
*NL*
the
least
.
He
resented
the
girl
's
position
,
as
if
the
lady
had
been
*NL*
the
commonest
of
commoners
.
That
is
the
story
.
I
hope
Lady
Dedlock
*NL*
will
excuse
its
painful
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
various
opinions
on
the
merits
,
more
or
less
conflicting
*NL*
with
Volumnia
's
.
That
fair
young
creature
can
not
believe
there
ever
*NL*
was
any
such
lady
and
rejects
the
whole
history
on
the
threshold
.
The
*NL*
majority
incline
to
the
debilitated
cousin
's
sentiment
,
which
is
in
*NL*
few
words
--
``
no

Sir

*NL*
generally
refers
back
in
his

arranges
a

sequence

a

There

Then

has
swelled
into

then
Lady

for
the

moves

comes

her

looked

after

passes
away
slowly
down

CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
Room
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
arrives
in
his
turret-room
a
little
breathed
by
the
*NL*
journey
up
,
though
leisurely
performed
.
There
is
an
expression
on
his
*NL*
face
as
if
he
had
discharged
his
mind
of
some
grave
matter
and
were
,
*NL*
in
his
close
way
,
satisfied
.
To
say
of
a
man
so
severely
and
strictly
*NL*
self-repressed
that
he
is
triumphant
would
be
to
do
him
as
great
an
*NL*
injustice
as
to
suppose
him
troubled
with
love
or
sentiment
or
any
*NL*
romantic
weakness
.
He
is
sedately
satisfied
.
Perhaps
there
is
a
*NL*
rather
increased
sense
of
power
upon
him
as
he
loosely
grasps
one
of
*NL*
his
veinous
wrists
with
his
other
hand
and
holding
it
behind
his
back
*NL*
walks
noiselessly
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
capacious
writing-table
in
the
room
on
which
is
a
pretty
*NL*
large
accumulation
of
papers
.
The
green
lamp
is
lighted
,
his
*NL*
reading-glasses
lie
upon
the
desk
,
the
easy-chair
is
wheeled
up
to
*NL*
it
,
and
it
would
seem
as
though
he
had
intended
to
bestow
an
hour
or
*NL*
so
upon
these
claims
on
his
attention
before
going
to
bed
.
But
he
*NL*
happens
not
to
be
in
a
business
mind
.
After
a
glance
at
the
documents
*NL*
awaiting
his
notice
--
with
his
head
bent
low
over
the
table
,
the
old
*NL*
man
's
sight
for
print
or
writing
being
defective
at
night
--
he
opens
*NL*
the
French
window
and
steps
out
upon
the
leads
.
There
he
again
walks
*NL*
slowly
up
and
down
in
the
same
attitude
,
subsiding
,
if
a
man
so
cool
*NL*
may
have
any
need
to
subside
,
from
the
story
he
has
related
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
was
once
when
men
as
knowing
as
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
would
walk
*NL*
on
turret-tops
in
the
starlight
and
look
up
into
the
sky
to
read
*NL*
their
fortunes
there
.
Hosts
of
stars
are
visible
to-night
,
though
*NL*
their
brilliancy
is
eclipsed
by
the
splendour
of
the
moon
.
If
he
be
*NL*
seeking
his
own
star
as
he
methodically
turns
and
turns
upon
the
*NL*
leads
,
it
should
be
but
a
pale
one
to
be
so
rustily
represented
*NL*
below
.
If
he
be
tracing
out
his
destiny
,
that
may
be
written
in
other
*NL*
characters
nearer
to
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
paces
the
leads
with
his
eyes
most
probably
as
high
above
his
*NL*
thoughts
as
they
are
high
above
the
earth
,
he
is
suddenly
stopped
in
*NL*
passing
the
window
by
two
eyes
that
meet
his
own
.
The
ceiling
of
his
*NL*
room
is
rather
low
;
and
the
upper
part
of
the
door
,
which
is
opposite
*NL*
the
window
,
is
of
glass
.
There
is
an
inner
baize
door
,
too
,
but
the
*NL*
night
being
warm
he
did
not
close
it
when
he
came
upstairs
.
These
*NL*
eyes
that
meet
his
own
are
looking
in
through
the
glass
from
the
*NL*
corridor
outside
.
He
knows
them
well
.
The
blood
has
not
flushed
into
*NL*
his
face
so
suddenly
and
redly
for
many
a
long
year
as
when
he
*NL*
recognizes
Lady
Dedlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
steps
into
the
room
,
and
she
comes
in
too
,
closing
both
the
doors
*NL*
behind
her
.
There
is
a
wild
disturbance
--
is
it
fear
or
anger
?
--
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
In
her
carriage
and
all
else
she
looks
as
she
looked
downstairs
*NL*
two
hours
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
fear
or
is
it
anger
now
?
He
can
not
be
sure
.
Both
might
be
as
*NL*
pale
,
both
as
intent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Dedlock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
does
not
speak
at
first
,
nor
even
when
she
has
slowly
dropped
*NL*
into
the
easy-chair
by
the
table
.
They
look
at
each
other
,
like
two
*NL*
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
told
my
story
to
so
many
persons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Dedlock
,
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
inform
you
that
I
knew
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
known
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
suspected
it
a
long
while
--
fully
known
it
a
little
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Months
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stands
before
her
with
one
hand
on
a
chair-back
and
the
other
in
*NL*
his
old-fashioned
waistcoat
and
shirt-frill
,
exactly
as
he
has
stood
*NL*
before
her
at
any
time
since
her
marriage
.
The
same
formal
*NL*
politeness
,
the
same
composed
deference
that
might
as
well
be
*NL*
defiance
;
the
whole
man
the
same
dark
,
cold
object
,
at
the
same
*NL*
distance
,
which
nothing
has
ever
diminished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
true
concerning
the
poor
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slightly
inclines
and
advances
his
head
as
not
quite
understanding
*NL*
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
you
related
.
Is
it
true
?
Do
her
friends
know
my
story
*NL*
also
?
Is
it
the
town-talk
yet
?
Is
it
chalked
upon
the
walls
and
cried
*NL*
in
the
streets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
!
Anger
,
and
fear
,
and
shame
.
All
three
contending
.
What
power
this
*NL*
woman
has
to
keep
these
raging
passions
down
!
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
*NL*
thoughts
take
such
form
as
he
looks
at
her
,
with
his
ragged
grey
*NL*
eyebrows
a
hair
's
breadth
more
contracted
than
usual
under
her
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Lady
Dedlock
.
That
was
a
hypothetical
case
,
arising
out
of
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
's
unconsciously
carrying
the
matter
with
so
high
a
hand
.
*NL*
But
it
would
be
a
real
case
if
they
knew
--
what
we
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
do
not
know
it
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
save
the
poor
girl
from
injury
before
they
know
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Lady
Dedlock
,
''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
replies
,
``
I
can
not
give
a
*NL*
satisfactory
opinion
on
that
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
thinks
,
with
the
interest
of
attentive
curiosity
,
as
he
*NL*
watches
the
struggle
in
her
breast
,
``
The
power
and
force
of
this
*NL*
woman
are
astonishing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
she
says
,
for
the
moment
obliged
to
set
her
lips
with
all
the
*NL*
energy
she
has
,
that
she
may
speak
distinctly
,
``
I
will
make
it
*NL*
plainer
.
I
do
not
dispute
your
hypothetical
case
.
I
anticipated
it
,
*NL*
and
felt
its
truth
as
strongly
as
you
can
do
,
when
I
saw
Mr.
*NL*
Rouncewell
here
.
I
knew
very
well
that
if
he
could
have
had
the
power
*NL*
of
seeing
me
as
I
was
,
he
would
consider
the
poor
girl
tarnished
by
*NL*
having
for
a
moment
been
,
although
most
innocently
,
the
subject
of
my
*NL*
great
and
distinguished
patronage
.
But
I
have
an
interest
in
her
,
or
*NL*
I
should
rather
say
--
no
longer
belonging
to
this
place
--
I
had
,
and
if
*NL*
you
can
find
so
much
consideration
for
the
woman
under
your
foot
as
*NL*
to
remember
that
,
she
will
be
very
sensible
of
your
mercy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
profoundly
attentive
,
throws
this
off
with
a
shrug
*NL*
of
self-depreciation
and
contracts
his
eyebrows
a
little
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
prepared
me
for
my
exposure

and
I
thank
you
for
that
too

Is
there
anything

you
require

Is
there
any
claim
that
I
*NL*
can
release

I
can
spare
my
husband
in
*NL*
obtaining
HIS
release

certifying
to
the
exactness
of
your

discovery

I
will
write
anything

here

now

that
you
will
*NL*
dictate
.
I
am
ready
to
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
would
do
it
,
thinks
the
lawyer
,
watchful
of
the
firm
hand
*NL*
with
which
she
takes
the
pen
!
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady

nothing

take

a

when
you
have
finished

''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
need
for
watching
one
another
should
be
over
now
,
but
they
do
*NL*
it
all
this
time
,
and
the
stars
watch
them
both
through
the
opened
*NL*
window
.
Away
in
the
moonlight
lie
the
woodland
fields
at
rest
,
and
*NL*
the
wide
house
is
as
quiet
as
the
narrow
one
.
The
narrow
one
!
Where
*NL*
are
the
digger
and
the
spade
,
this
peaceful
night
,
destined
to
add
*NL*
the
last
great
secret
to
the
many
secrets
of
the
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
existence
?
Is
the
man
born
yet
,
is
the
spade
wrought
yet
?
Curious
*NL*
questions
to
consider
,
more
curious
perhaps
not
to
consider
,
under
*NL*
the
watching
stars
upon
a
summer
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
repentance
or
remorse

any
feeling
of
mine
,

Lady
Dedlock
*NL*
presently
proceeds
,
``
I

not
a

If

deaf

by

*NL*
*NL*
He
makes
a
feint
of
offering
a
protest
,
but
she
sweeps
it
away
with
*NL*
her
disdainful
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

*NL*
``

quite
unmoved

*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
shakes
his
head
.
She
rises
,
but
he
,
without
moving
*NL*
hand
from
chair-back
or
from
old-fashioned
waistcoat
and
shirt-frill
,
*NL*
shakes
his
head

*NL*
``

he
very
calmly
replies

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
Without
deigning
to
rejoin
,
she
moves
to
the
inner
door
and
has
it
in
*NL*
her
hand
when
he
says
to
her
,
without
himself
stirring
hand

foot
*NL*
or
raising
his
voice

shall
ring
the

alarm-bell

rouse
the

And
then

out

*NL*
*NL*
He
has
conquered
her
.
She
falters
,
trembles
,
and
puts
her
hand
*NL*
confusedly
to
her
head
.
Slight
tokens
these
in
any
one
else
,
but
when
*NL*
so
practised
an
eye
as
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
sees
indecision
for
a
moment
*NL*
in
such
a
subject

he
thoroughly
knows
its
value

*NL*
*NL*
He
promptly
says
again
,
``
Have
the
goodness

hear
me

Lady
Dedlock

*NL*
and
motions
to
the
chair
from
which
she
has
risen

She
hesitates
,

*NL*
he
motions
again
,
and
she
sits
down

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
will
not
apologize

position

so
well

known
to
you
that

can
hardly
imagine

*NL*
``

she
returns
without
looking
up
from

are

fixed

*NL*
His
jealous
glance
as
she
walks
that
way
betrays
an
instant
's
*NL*
misgiving
that
she
may
have
it
in
her
thoughts
to
leap
over
,
and
*NL*
dashing
against
ledge
and
cornice
,
strike
her
life
out
upon
the
*NL*
terrace
below

But
a
moment
's
observation
of
her
figure
as
she
stands
*NL*
in
the
window
without
any
support
,
looking
out
at
the
stars
--
not
*NL*
up
--
gloomily
out
at
those
stars
which
are
low
in
the
heavens
,
*NL*
reassures
him
.
By
facing
round
as
she
has
moved
,
he
stands
a
little
*NL*
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

not
clear
what

pauses

she
makes
no

heavily

soon
have
hoped
to
root
up
by
means
of
*NL*
my
own
strength
and
my
own
hands
the
oldest
tree
on
this
estate
as
to
*NL*
shake
your
hold
upon
Sir
Leicester
and
Sir
Leicester
's
trust
and
*NL*
confidence
in
you
.
And
even
now
,
with
this
case
,
I
hesitate
.
Not
that
*NL*
he
could
doubt
-LRB-
that
,
even
with
him
,
is
impossible
-RRB-
,
but
that
nothing
*NL*
can
prepare
him
for
the
blow
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
my
flight

''
she
returned
.
``
Think
of
it
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
flight

Lady
Dedlock

would
spread
the
whole
truth

a

hundred
times
the

far

It
would
be

save
the

It

not

*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
quiet
decision
in
his
reply
which
admits
of
no
*NL*
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
speak
of
Sir

Mr.

very
dry
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore

''
says
Mr.

,
pursuing
his

in
his
jog-trot

style
,
``
I
have
much
to
consider

This
is
to
be
hushed
up

it

How
can
it
be
,
if
Sir
Leicester
is
driven
out
of
his
wits

laid
*NL*
upon
a
death-bed
?
If
I
inflicted
this
shock
upon
him
to-morrow

morning
,
how
could
the
immediate
change
in
him
be
accounted
for
?
What
*NL*
could
have
caused
it
?
What
could
have
divided
you
?
Lady
Dedlock
,
the
*NL*
wall-chalking
and
the
street-crying
would
come
on
directly
,
and
you
*NL*
are
to
remember
that
it
would
not
affect
you
merely
-LRB-
whom
I
can
not
at
*NL*
all
consider
in
this
business
-RRB-
but
your
husband

Lady
Dedlock

your

*NL*
*NL*
He
gets
plainer
as
he
gets
on
,

not
an
atom
more
emphatic

*NL*
animated

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
another
point

he
continues
,
``
in
which
the
case
*NL*
presents
itself

Sir
Leicester
is
devoted
to
you
almost
to
*NL*
infatuation

He
might
not
be
able
to
overcome
that
infatuation
,
even
*NL*
knowing
what
we
know
.
I
am
putting
an
extreme
case
,
but
it
might
be
*NL*
so
.
If
so
,
it
were
better
that
he
knew
nothing
.
Better
for
common
*NL*
sense
,
better
for
him
,
better
for
me
.
I
must
take
all
this
into
*NL*
account
,
and
it
combines
to
render
a
decision
very
difficult

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stands
looking
out
at
the
same
stars
without
a
word
.
They
are
*NL*
beginning
to
pale
,
and
she
looks
as
if
their
coldness
froze
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
experience
teaches
me
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
who
has
by
this
*NL*
time
got
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
is
going
on
in
his
business
*NL*
consideration
of
the
matter
like
a
machine

``
My
experience
teaches

that
most

*NL*
to
leave

It
is
at
the
bottom
of
three
fourths
of

their
troubles

So
I
thought
when
Sir

married
,

so
I
*NL*
always
have
thought
since

No
more
about
that

I
must
now
be
guided

said
slowly

*NL*
``

asks
all
her

calling
them
over
in

sleep

now
remind

be
no

no

I

I
believe
we
have
never
*NL*
wholly
trusted
each

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stands
absorbed
in
the
same
frozen
way
for
some
little
time
*NL*
before
asking
,
``
Is
there
anything
more
to
be
said
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
Mr.

returns
methodically
as
he
softly
rubs
his
*NL*
hands
,
``
I
should
like
to
be
assured
of

acquiescence

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

And
I
would
wish
in
conclusion
to
remind
you
,
as
a
business
*NL*
precaution
,
in
case
it
should
be
necessary
to
recall
the
fact
in
any
*NL*
communication
with
Sir
Leicester
,
that
throughout
our
interview
I
*NL*
have
expressly
stated
my
sole
consideration
to
be
Sir
Leicester
's
*NL*
feelings
and
honour
and
the
family
reputation
.
I
should
have
been
*NL*
happy
to
have
made
Lady
Dedlock
a
prominent
consideration
,
too
,
if
*NL*
the
case
had
admitted
of
it
;
but
unfortunately
it
does
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
attest
your
fidelity
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
before
and
after
saying
it
she
remains
absorbed
,
but
at
length
*NL*
moves
,
and
turns
,
unshaken
in
her
natural
and
acquired
presence
,
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
opens
both
the
doors
exactly
as
he
*NL*
would
have
done
yesterday
,
or
as
he
would
have
done
ten
years
ago
,
*NL*
and
makes
his
old-fashioned
bow
as
she
passes
out
.
It
is
not
an
*NL*
ordinary
look
that
he
receives
from
the
handsome
face
as
it
goes
into
*NL*
the
darkness
,
and
it
is
not
an
ordinary
movement
,
though
a
very
*NL*
slight
one
,
that
acknowledges
his
courtesy
.
But
as
he
reflects
when
*NL*
he
is
left
alone
,
the
woman
has
been
putting
no
common
constraint
*NL*
upon
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
know
it
all
the
better
if
he
saw
the
woman
pacing
her
own
*NL*
rooms
with
her
hair
wildly
thrown
from
her
flung-back
face
,
her
hands
*NL*
clasped
behind
her
head
,
her
figure
twisted
as
if
by
pain
.
He
would
*NL*
think
so
all
the
more
if
he
saw
the
woman
thus
hurrying
up
and
down
*NL*
for
hours
,
without
fatigue
,
without
intermission
,
followed
by
the
*NL*
faithful
step
upon
the
Ghost
's
Walk
.
But
he
shuts
out
the
now
chilled
*NL*
air
,
draws
the
window-curtain
,
goes
to
bed
,
and
falls
asleep
.
And
*NL*
truly
when
the
stars
go
out
and
the
wan
day
peeps
into
the
*NL*
turret-chamber
,
finding
him
at
his
oldest
,
he
looks
as
if
the
digger
*NL*
and
the
spade
were
both
commissioned
and
would
soon
be
digging
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
wan
day
peeps
in
at
Sir
Leicester
pardoning
the
repentant
*NL*
country
in
a
majestically
condescending
dream
;
and
at
the
cousins
*NL*
entering
on
various
public
employments
,
principally
receipt
of
*NL*
salary
;
and
at
the
chaste
Volumnia
,
bestowing
a
dower
of
fifty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
upon
a
hideous
old
general
with
a
mouth
of
false
*NL*
teeth
like
a
pianoforte
too
full
of
keys
,
long
the
admiration
of
Bath
*NL*
and
the
terror
of
every
other
community
.
Also
into
rooms
high
in
the
*NL*
roof
,
and
into
offices
in
court-yards
,
and
over
stables
,
where
*NL*
humbler
ambition
dreams
of
bliss
,
in
keepers
'
lodges
,
and
in
holy
*NL*
matrimony
with
Will
or
Sally
.
Up
comes
the
bright
sun
,
drawing
*NL*
everything
up
with
it
--
the
Wills
and
Sallys
,
the
latent
vapour
in
the
*NL*
earth
,
the
drooping
leaves
and
flowers
,
the
birds
and
beasts
and
*NL*
creeping
things
,
the
gardeners
to
sweep
the
dewy
turf
and
unfold
*NL*
emerald
velvet
where
the
roller
passes
,
the
smoke
of
the
great
*NL*
kitchen
fire
wreathing
itself
straight
and
high
into
the
lightsome
*NL*
air
.
Lastly
,
up
comes
the
flag
over
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
unconscious
*NL*
head
cheerfully
proclaiming
that
Sir
Leicester
and
Lady
Dedlock
are
*NL*
in
their
happy
home
and
that
there
is
hospitality
at
the
place
in
*NL*
Lincolnshire

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
Chambers
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
verdant
undulations
and
the
spreading
oaks
of
the
Dedlock
*NL*
property
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
transfers
himself
to
the
stale
heat
and
*NL*
dust
of
London
.
His
manner
of
coming
and
going
between
the
two
places
*NL*
is
one
of
his
impenetrabilities
.
He
walks
into
Chesney
Wold
as
if
it
*NL*
were
next
door
to
his
chambers
and
returns
to
his
chambers
as
if
he
*NL*
had
never
been
out
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
.
He
neither
changes
his
*NL*
dress
before
the
journey
nor
talks
of
it
afterwards
.
He
melted
out
of
*NL*
his
turret-room
this
morning
,
just
as
now
,
in
the
late
twilight
,
he
*NL*
melts
into
his
own
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
a
dingy
London
bird
among
the
birds
at
roost
in
these
pleasant
*NL*
fields
,
where
the
sheep
are
all
made
into
parchment
,
the
goats
into
*NL*
wigs
,
and
the
pasture
into
chaff
,
the
lawyer
,
smoke-dried
and
faded
,
*NL*
dwelling
among
mankind
but
not
consorting
with
them
,
aged
without
*NL*
experience
of
genial
youth
,
and
so
long
used
to
make
his
cramped
nest
*NL*
in
holes
and
corners
of
human
nature
that
he
has
forgotten
its
*NL*
broader
and
better
range
,
comes
sauntering
home
.
In
the
oven
made
by
*NL*
the
hot
pavements
and
hot
buildings
,
he
has
baked
himself
dryer
than
*NL*
usual
;
and
he
has
in
his
thirsty
mind
his
mellowed
port-wine
half
a
*NL*
century
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lamplighter
is
skipping
up
and
down
his
ladder
on
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
's
side
of
the
Fields
when
that
high-priest
of
noble
*NL*
mysteries
arrives
at
his
own
dull
court-yard
.
He
ascends
the
*NL*
door-steps
and
is
gliding
into
the
dusky
hall
when
he
encounters
,
on
*NL*
the
top
step
,
a
bowing
and
propitiatory
little
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
Snagsby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
I
hope
you
are
well
,
sir
.
I
was
just
giving
you
up
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
going
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
?
What
is
it
?
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
holding
his
hat
at
the
side
of
his
*NL*
head
in
his
deference
towards
his
best
customer
,
``
I
was
wishful
to
*NL*
say
a
word
to
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
say
it
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
it
then
.
''
The
lawyer
turns
,
leans
his
arms
on
the
iron
railing
*NL*
at
the
top
of
the
steps
,
and
looks
at
the
lamplighter
lighting
the
*NL*
court-yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
relating
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
in
a
mysterious
low
voice
,
``
it
is
*NL*
relating
--
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
--
to
the
foreigner
,
*NL*
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
eyes
him
with
some
surprise
.
``
What
foreigner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
foreign
female
,
sir
.
French
,
if
I
do
n't
mistake
?
I
am
not
*NL*
acquainted
with
that
language
myself
,
but
I
should
judge
from
her
*NL*
manners
and
appearance
that
she
was
French
;
anyways
,
certainly
*NL*
foreign
.
Her
that
was
upstairs
,
sir
,
when
Mr.
Bucket
and
me
had
the
*NL*
honour
of
waiting
upon
you
with
the
sweeping-boy
that
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Yes
,
yes
.
Mademoiselle
Hortense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
?
''
Mr.
Snagsby
coughs
his
cough
of
submission
behind
his
*NL*
hat
.
``
I
am
not
acquainted
myself
with
the
names
of
foreigners
in
*NL*
general
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
it
WOULD
be
that
.
''
Mr.
Snagsby
appears
*NL*
to
have
set
out
in
this
reply
with
some
desperate
design
of
repeating
*NL*
the
name
,
but
on
reflection
coughs
again
to
excuse
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
can
you
have
to
say
,
Snagsby
,
''
demands
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
*NL*
``
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
returns
the
stationer
,
shading
his
communication
with
*NL*
his
hat
,
``
it
falls
a
little
hard
upon
me
.
My
domestic
happiness
is
*NL*
very
great
--
at
least
,
it
's
as
great
as
can
be
expected
,
I
'm
sure
--
but
*NL*
my
little
woman
is
rather
given
to
jealousy

Not
to
put
too
fine
a

point
upon
it

she
is
very
much
given
to
jealousy

And

*NL*
foreign
female
of
that
genteel
appearance
coming
into
the
shop
,
and
*NL*
hovering
--
I
should
be
the
last
to
make
use
of
a
strong
expression
if
*NL*
I
could
avoid
it
,
but
hovering
,
sir
--
in
the
court
--
you
know
it
*NL*
is
--
now
ai
n't
it
?
I
only
put
it
to
yourself
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
,
having
said
this
in
a
very
plaintive
manner
,
throws
in
a
*NL*
cough
of
general
application
to
fill
up
all
the
blanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
?
''
asks
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
sir
,
''
returns
Mr.
Snagsby
;
``
I
was
sure
you
would
feel
it
*NL*
yourself
and
would
excuse
the
reasonableness
of
MY
feelings
when
*NL*
coupled
with
the
known
excitableness
of
my
little
woman
.
You
see
,
the
*NL*
foreign
female
--
which
you
mentioned
her
name
just
now
,
with
quite
a
*NL*
native
sound
I
am
sure
--
caught
up
the
word
Snagsby
that
night
,
being
*NL*
uncommon
quick
,
and
made
inquiry
,
and
got
the
direction
and
come
at
*NL*
dinner-time
.
Now
Guster
,
our
young
woman
,
is
timid
and
has
fits
,
and
*NL*
she
,
taking
fright
at
the
foreigner
's
looks
--
which
are
fierce
--
and
at
*NL*
a
grinding
manner
that
she
has
of
speaking
--
which
is
calculated
to
*NL*
alarm
a
weak
mind
--
gave
way
to
it
,
instead
of
bearing
up
against
it
,
*NL*
and
tumbled
down
the
kitchen
stairs
out
of
one
into
another
,
such
*NL*
fits
as
I
do
sometimes
think
are
never
gone
into
,
or
come
out
of
,
in
*NL*
any
house
but
ours
.
Consequently
there
was
by
good
fortune
ample
*NL*
occupation
for
my
little
woman
,
and
only
me
to
answer
the
shop
.
When
*NL*
she
DID
say
that
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
being
always
denied
to
her
by
his
*NL*
employer
-LRB-
which
I
had
no
doubt
at
the
time
was
a
foreign
mode
of
*NL*
viewing
a
clerk
-RRB-
,
she
would
do
herself
the
pleasure
of
continually
*NL*
calling
at
my
place
until
she
was
let
in
here
.
Since
then
she
has
*NL*
been
,
as
I
began
by
saying
,
hovering
,
hovering
,
sir
''
--
Mr.
Snagsby
*NL*
repeats
the
word
with
pathetic
emphasis
--
``
in
the
court
.
The
effects
*NL*
of
which
movement
it
is
impossible
to
calculate
.
I
should
n't
wonder
*NL*
if
it
might
have
already
given
rise
to
the
painfullest
mistakes
even
*NL*
in
the
neighbours

minds
,
not
mentioning
-LRB-
if
such
a
thing
was
*NL*
possible
-RRB-
my
little
woman
.
Whereas
,
goodness
knows
,
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
I
never
had
an
idea
of
a
foreign
female
,
*NL*
except
as
being
formerly
connected
with
a
bunch
of
brooms
and
a
baby
,
*NL*
or
at
the
present
time
with
a
tambourine
and
earrings
.
I
never
had
,
I
*NL*
do
assure
you
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
had
listened
gravely
to
this
complaint
and
inquires
*NL*
when
the
stationer
has
finished
,
``
And
that
's
all
,
is
it
,
Snagsby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
yes
,
sir
,
that
's
all
,
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
ending
with
a
cough
*NL*
that
plainly
adds
,
``
and
it
's
enough
too
--
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
Mademoiselle
Hortense
may
want
or
mean
,
unless
she
*NL*
is
mad

says
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
she
was
,
you
know
,
sir
,
''
Mr.
Snagsby
pleads
,
``
it
would
n't
be
*NL*
a
consolation
to
have
some
weapon
or
another
in
the
form
of
a
foreign
*NL*
dagger
planted
in
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
the
other
.
``
Well
,
well
!
This
shall
be
stopped

I
am
sorry
*NL*
you
have
been
inconvenienced
.
If
she
comes
again
,
send
her
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
,
with
much
bowing
and
short
apologetic
coughing
,
takes
*NL*
his
leave
,
lightened
in
heart
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
goes
upstairs
,
saying
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
These
women
were
created
to
give
trouble
the
whole
earth
*NL*
over
.
The
mistress
not
being
enough
to
deal
with
,
here
's
the
maid
*NL*
now
!
But
I
will
be
short
with
THIS
jade
at
least
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
unlocks
his
door
,
gropes
his
way
into
his
murky
rooms
,
*NL*
lights
his
candles
,
and
looks
about
him
.
It
is
too
dark
to
see
much
*NL*
of
the
Allegory
overhead
there
,
but
that
importunate
Roman
,
who
is
*NL*
for
ever
toppling
out
of
the
clouds
and
pointing
,
is
at
his
old
work
*NL*
pretty
distinctly
.
Not
honouring
him
with
much
attention
,
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
takes
a
small
key
from
his
pocket
,
unlocks
a
drawer
in
*NL*
which
there
is
another
key
,
which
unlocks
a
chest
in
which
there
is
*NL*
another
,
and
so
comes
to
the
cellar-key
,
with
which
he
prepares
to
*NL*
descend
to
the
regions
of
old
wine
.
He
is
going
towards
the
door
with
*NL*
a
candle
in
his
hand
when
a
knock
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
this
?
Aye
,
aye
,
mistress
,
it
's
you

it

You
appear
at
a
*NL*
good
time
.
I
have
just
been
hearing
of
you
.
Now
!
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stands
the
candle
on
the
chimney-piece
in
the
clerk
's
hall
and
*NL*
taps
his
dry
cheek
with
the
key
as
he
addresses
these
words
of
*NL*
welcome
to
Mademoiselle
Hortense
.
That
feline
personage
,
with
her
*NL*
lips
tightly
shut
and
her
eyes
looking
out
at
him
sideways
,
softly
*NL*
closes
the
door
before
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
great
deal
of
trouble
to
find
you

sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
here
very
often

It
has
always
been
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
and
quite
true

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
true

Lies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
there
is
a
suddenness
in
the
manner
of
Mademoiselle
Hortense
*NL*
so
like
a
bodily
spring
upon
the
subject
of
it
that
such
subject
*NL*
involuntarily
starts
and
fails
back
.
It
is
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
case
at
*NL*
present
,
though
Mademoiselle
Hortense
,
with
her
eyes
almost
shut
up
*NL*
-LRB-
but
still
looking
out
sideways
-RRB-
,
is
only
smiling
contemptuously
and
*NL*
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
mistress
,
''
says
the
lawyer
,
tapping
the
key
hastily
upon
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
``
If
you
have
anything
to
say
,
say
it
,
say
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
you
have
not
use
me
well

You
have
been
mean
and
shabby

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mean
and
shabby
,
eh

returns
the
lawyer
,
rubbing
his
nose
with
the
*NL*
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

What
is
it
that
I
tell
you

You
know

You

*NL*
attrapped
me

catched
me

to
give

to
show
you
the
dress

mine
my

wore

night

*NL*
have
prayed
me
to
come
in
it
here
to
meet
that
boy

Say
!
Is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Hortense
makes
another
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
vixen
,
a
vixen
!
''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
seems
to
meditate
as
he
*NL*
looks
distrustfully
at
her
,
then
he
replies
,
``
Well
,
wench
,
well

I
*NL*
paid
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
paid
me

''
she
repeats
with
fierce
disdain
.
``
Two
sovereign

I
*NL*
have
not
change
them
,
I
re-fuse
them
,
I
des-pise
them

throw
them
*NL*
from
me

''
Which
she
literally
does
,
taking
them
out
of
her
bosom
as
*NL*
she
speaks
and
flinging
them
with
such
violence
on
the
floor
that
*NL*
they
jerk
up
again
into
the
light
before
they
roll
away
into
corners
*NL*
and
slowly
settle
down
there
after
spinning
vehemently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
''
says
Mademoiselle
Hortense
,
darkening
her
large
eyes
again
.
*NL*
``
You
have
paid
me
?
Eh
,
my
God
,
oh
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
rubs
his
head
with
the
key
while
she
entertains
*NL*
herself
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
rich
,
my
fair
friend
,
''
he
composedly
observes
,
``
to
throw
*NL*
money
about
in
that
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
AM
rich

she
returns
.
``
I
am
very
rich

hate

I
hate

all
my

*NL*
*NL*
``

How

*NL*
``

en-r-r-r-raged

''
It
appears
impossible
for
mademoiselle
to
roll
the
*NL*
letter
``
r
''
sufficiently
in
this
word
,
notwithstanding
that
she
*NL*
assists
her
energetic
delivery
by
clenching
both
her
hands
and
*NL*
setting
all
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
knew
that

did
I

says
Mr.

,
examining
the
wards
*NL*
of
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

without

You

reason

I
det-est

''
Mademoiselle
folds
her
*NL*
arms
and
throws
this
last
remark
at
him
over
one
of
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
said
this

have
you
anything

*NL*
*NL*

In

down
to
the

word

mademoiselle
has
been
ironically
polite
and
*NL*
tender

then
as
suddenly
dashed
into
the
bitterest
and
most
defiant

scorn

with
her
black
eyes
in
one

very
nearly

She
merely
throws

It

good
English

citizens
from
being
troubled

by
a
lady
's
visits
against
his
*NL*
desire
.
And
on
his
complaining
that
he
is
so
troubled
,
it
takes
hold
*NL*
of
the
troublesome
lady
and
shuts
her
up
in
prison
under
hard
*NL*
discipline
.
Turns
the
key
upon

,
mistress

''
Illustrating
with
the
*NL*
cellar-key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
?
''
returns
mademoiselle
in
the
same
pleasant
voice
.
``
That
is
*NL*
droll
!
But
--
my
faith
!
--
still
what
does
it
matter
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fair
friend

says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
``
make
another
visit
here

*NL*
at

Snagsby

In

will
send

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
contradictory
for
one
in
mademoiselle
's
state
of
*NL*
agreeable
jocularity
to
foam
at
the
mouth
,
otherwise
a
tigerish
*NL*
expansion
thereabouts
might
look
as

very
little
more
would

her
do
it

Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,

*NL*

mademoiselle

stretching
out

pursues
the

without

goes
down

*NL*
devotes
himself
to

CHAPTER
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
matters
little
now
how
much
I
thought
of
my
living
mother
who
had
*NL*
told
me
evermore
to
consider
her
dead
.
I
could
not
venture
to
*NL*
approach
her
or
to
communicate
with
her
in
writing
,
for
my
sense
of
*NL*
the
peril
in
which
her
life
was
passed
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
my
*NL*
fears
of
increasing
it
.
Knowing
that
my
mere
existence
as
a
living
*NL*
creature
was
an
unforeseen
danger
in
her
way
,
I
could
not
always
*NL*
conquer
that
terror
of
myself
which
had
seized
me
when
I
first
knew
*NL*
the
secret
.
At
no
time
did
I
dare
to
utter
her
name
.
I
felt
as
if
I
*NL*
did
not
even
dare
to
hear
it
.
If
the
conversation
anywhere
,
when
I
*NL*
was
present
,
took
that
direction
,
as
it
sometimes
naturally
did
,
I
*NL*
tried
not
to
hear
:
I
mentally
counted
,
repeated
something
that
I
*NL*
knew
,
or
went
out
of
the
room
.
I
am
conscious
now
that
I
often
did
*NL*
these
things
when
there
can
have
been
no
danger
of
her
being
spoken
*NL*
of
,
but
I
did
them
in
the
dread
I
had
of
hearing
anything
that
might
*NL*
lead
to
her
betrayal
,
and
to
her
betrayal
through
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
matters
little
now
how
often
I
recalled
the
tones
of
my
mother
's
*NL*
voice
,
wondered
whether
I
should
ever
hear
it
again
as
I
so
longed
to
*NL*
do
,
and
thought
how
strange
and
desolate
it
was
that
it
should
be
so
*NL*
new
to
me
.
It
matters
little
that
I
watched
for
every
public
mention
*NL*
of
my
mother
's
name
;
that
I
passed
and
repassed
the
door
of
her
house
*NL*
in
town
,
loving
it
,
but
afraid
to
look
at
it
;
that
I
once
sat
in
the
*NL*
theatre
when
my
mother
was
there
and
saw
me
,
and
when
we
were
so
wide
*NL*
asunder
before
the
great
company
of
all
degrees
that
any
link
or
*NL*
confidence
between
us
seemed
a
dream
.
It
is
all
,
all
over
.
My
lot
has
*NL*
been
so
blest
that
I
can
relate
little
of
myself
which
is
not
a
story
*NL*
of
goodness
and
generosity
in
others
.
I
may
well
pass
that
little
and
*NL*
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
settled
at
home
again
,
Ada
and
I
had
many
conversations
*NL*
with
my
guardian
of
which
Richard
was
the
theme
.
My
dear
girl
was
*NL*
deeply
grieved
that
he
should
do
their
kind
cousin
so
much
wrong
,
but
*NL*
she
was
so
faithful
to
Richard
that
she
could
not
bear
to
blame
him
*NL*
even
for
that
.
My
guardian
was
assured
of
it
,
and
never
coupled
his
*NL*
name
with
a
word
of
reproof
.
``
Rick
is
mistaken
,
my
dear
,
''
he
would
*NL*
say
to
her
.
``
Well
,
well
!
We
have
all
been
mistaken
over
and
over
*NL*
again
.
We
must
trust
to
you
and
time
to
set
him
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
knew
afterwards
what
we
suspected
then
,
that
he
did
not
trust
to
*NL*
time
until
he
had
often
tried
to
open
Richard
's
eyes
.
That
he
had
*NL*
written
to
him
,
gone
to
him
,
talked
with
him
,
tried
every
gentle
and
*NL*
persuasive
art
his
kindness
could
devise
.
Our
poor
devoted
Richard
*NL*
was
deaf
and
blind
to
all
.
If
he
were
wrong
,
he
would
make
amends
*NL*
when
the
Chancery
suit
was
over
.
If
he
were
groping
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
he
could
not
do
better
than
do
his
utmost
to
clear
away
those
*NL*
clouds
in
which
so
much
was
confused
and
obscured
.
Suspicion
and
*NL*
misunderstanding
were
the
fault
of
the
suit
?
Then
let
him
work
the
*NL*
suit
out
and
come
through
it
to
his
right
mind
.
This
was
his
*NL*
unvarying
reply
.
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
had
obtained
such
possession
*NL*
of
his
whole
nature
that
it
was
impossible
to
place
any
consideration
*NL*
before
him
which
he
did
not
,
with
a
distorted
kind
of
reason
,
make
a
*NL*
new
argument
in
favour
of
his
doing
what
he
did
.
``
So
that
it
is
even
*NL*
more
mischievous
,
''
said
my
guardian
once
to
me
,
``
to
remonstrate
with
*NL*
the
poor
dear
fellow
than
to
leave
him
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
one
of
these
opportunities
of
mentioning
my
doubts
of
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
as
a
good
adviser
for
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adviser
!
''
returned
my
guardian
,
laughing
,
``
My
dear
,
who
would
advise
*NL*
with
Skimpole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Encourager
would
perhaps
have
been
a
better
word
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Encourager
!
''
returned
my
guardian
again
.
``
Who
could
be
encouraged
by
*NL*
Skimpole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Richard
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Such
an
unworldly
,
uncalculating
,
gossamer
*NL*
creature
is
a
relief
to
him
and
an
amusement
.
But
as
to
advising
or
*NL*
encouraging
or
occupying
a
serious
station
towards
anybody
or
*NL*
anything
,
it
is
simply
not
to
be
thought
of
in
such
a
child
as
*NL*
Skimpole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
cousin
John
,
''
said
Ada
,
who
had
just
joined
us
and
now
looked
*NL*
over
my
shoulder
,
``
what
made
him
such
a
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
him
such
a
child
?
''
inquired
my
guardian
,
rubbing
his
head
,
*NL*
a
little
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
cousin
John
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
slowly
replied
,
roughening
his
head
more
and
more
,
``
he
is
*NL*
all
sentiment
,
and
--
and
susceptibility
,
and
--
and
sensibility
,
*NL*
and
--
and
imagination
.
And
these
qualities
are
not
regulated
in
him
,
*NL*
somehow
.
I
suppose
the
people
who
admired
him
for
them
in
his
youth
*NL*
attached
too
much
importance
to
them
and
too
little
to
any
training
*NL*
that
would
have
balanced
and
adjusted
them
,
and
so
he
became
what
he
*NL*
is
.
Hey
?
''
said
my
guardian
,
stopping
short
and
looking
at
us
*NL*
hopefully
.
``
What
do
you
think
,
you
two
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
,
glancing
at
me
,
said
she
thought
it
was
a
pity
he
should
be
an
*NL*
expense
to
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
,
so
it
is
,
''
returned
my
guardian
hurriedly
.
``
That
must
not
*NL*
be
.
We
must
arrange
that
.
I
must
prevent
it
.
That
will
never
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
said
I
thought
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
he
had
ever
*NL*
introduced
Richard
to
Mr.
Vholes
for
a
present
of
five
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
?
''
said
my
guardian
with
a
passing
shade
of
vexation
on
his
*NL*
face
.
``
But
there
you
have
the
man
.
There
you
have
the
man
!
There
is
*NL*
nothing
mercenary
in
that
with
him
.
He
has
no
idea
of
the
value
of
*NL*
money
.
He
introduces
Rick
,
and
then
he
is
good
friends
with
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
and
borrows
five
pounds
of
him
.
He
means
nothing
by
it
and
*NL*
thinks
nothing
of
it
.
He
told
you
himself
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
!
''
cried
my
guardian
,
quite
triumphant
.
``
There
you
have
the
*NL*
man
!
If
he
had
meant
any
harm
by
it
or
was
conscious
of
any
harm
in
*NL*
it
,
he
would
n't
tell
it
.
He
tells
it
as
he
does
it
in
mere
*NL*
simplicity
.
But
you
shall
see
him
in
his
own
home
,
and
then
you
'll
*NL*
understand
him
better
.
We
must
pay
a
visit
to
Harold
Skimpole
and
*NL*
caution
him
on
these
points
.
Lord
bless
you
,
my
dears
,
an
infant
,
an
*NL*
infant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
plan
,
we
went
into
London
on
an
early
day
and
*NL*
presented
ourselves
at
Mr.
Skimpole
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
in
a
place
called
the
Polygon
,
in
Somers
Town
,
where
there
*NL*
were
at
that
time
a
number
of
poor
Spanish
refugees
walking
about
in
*NL*
cloaks
,
smoking
little
paper
cigars
.
Whether
he
was
a
better
tenant
*NL*
than
one
might
have
supposed
,
in
consequence
of
his
friend
Somebody
*NL*
always
paying
his
rent
at
last
,
or
whether
his
inaptitude
for
*NL*
business
rendered
it
particularly
difficult
to
turn
him
out
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
;
but
he
had
occupied
the
same
house
some
years
.
It
was
in
a
*NL*
state
of
dilapidation
quite
equal
to
our
expectation
.
Two
or
three
of
*NL*
the
area
railings
were
gone
,
the
water-butt
was
broken
,
the
knocker
*NL*
was
loose
,
the
bell-handle
had
been
pulled
off
a
long
time
to
judge
*NL*
from
the
rusty
state
of
the
wire
,
and
dirty
footprints
on
the
steps
*NL*
were
the
only
signs
of
its
being
inhabited
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
slatternly
full-blown
girl
who
seemed
to
be
bursting
out
at
the
*NL*
rents
in
her
gown
and
the
cracks
in
her
shoes
like
an
over-ripe
berry
*NL*
answered
our
knock
by
opening
the
door
a
very
little
way
and
stopping
*NL*
up
the
gap
with
her
figure
.
As
she
knew
Mr.
Jarndyce
-LRB-
indeed
Ada
and
*NL*
I
both
thought
that
she
evidently
associated
him
with
the
receipt
of
*NL*
her
wages
-RRB-
,
she
immediately
relented
and
allowed
us
to
pass
in
.
The
*NL*
lock
of
the
door
being
in
a
disabled
condition
,
she
then
applied
*NL*
herself
to
securing
it
with
the
chain
,
which
was
not
in
good
action
*NL*
either
,
and
said
would
we
go
upstairs
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
,
still
seeing
no
other
furniture
*NL*
than
the
dirty
footprints
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
without
further
ceremony
*NL*
entered
a
room
there
,
and
we
followed
.
It
was
dingy
enough
and
not
at
*NL*
all
clean
,
but
furnished
with
an
odd
kind
of
shabby
luxury
,
with
a
*NL*
large
footstool
,
a
sofa
,
and
plenty
of
cushions
,
an
easy-chair
,
and
*NL*
plenty
of
pillows
,
a
piano
,
books
,
drawing
materials
,
music
,
*NL*
newspapers
,
and
a
few
sketches
and
pictures
.
A
broken
pane
of
glass
*NL*
in
one
of
the
dirty
windows
was
papered
and
wafered
over
,
but
there
*NL*
was
a
little
plate
of
hothouse
nectarines
on
the
table
,
and
there
was
*NL*
another
of
grapes
,
and
another
of
sponge-cakes
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
bottle
of
light
wine
.
Mr.
Skimpole
himself
reclined
upon
the
sofa
in
*NL*
a
dressing-gown
,
drinking
some
fragrant
coffee
from
an
old
china
*NL*
cup
--
it
was
then
about
mid-day
--
and
looking
at
a
collection
of
*NL*
wallflowers
in
the

He
was
not

disconcerted
by

rose

received
us
in
his
usual
airy
manner

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I

he
said
when
we
were
seated
,
not
without
some
*NL*
little
difficulty
,
the
greater
part
of
the
chairs
being
broken
.
``
Here
*NL*
I
am

This
is
my
frugal
breakfast

Some
men

beef

for
breakfast

I
do

Give
me
my
peach

my
cup

my
claret
;
I
am
content

I
do

they
remind
me
of
the
sun

There
's
nothing

Mere
animal
satisfaction

my

to
us

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

said
Mr.

turning
his
bright
face
about
,
``

my

No

he
answered

``
No

His

wanted
to

I

*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
looked
at
us
with
a
smile
,
as
though
he
asked
us
,
``
Is
it
*NL*
possible
to
be
worldly
with
this
baby

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a

''
said
Mr.

,
gaily
taking
a
little
claret
in
a
*NL*
tumbler
,
``
that
will
ever
be
remembered

We
shall
call

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
to
summon
them
when
my
guardian
interposed
and
asked
him
*NL*
to
pause
a
moment
,
as
he
wished
to
say
a
word
to
him
first
.
``
My
dear
*NL*
Jarndyce

he
cheerfully
replied
,
going
back
to
his
sofa
,
``
as
many

moments

no

We

never

Not
the

Certainly

We

*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
looked
at
us
again
,
plainly
saying
,
``
You
hear
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Harold
,
''
he
began
,
``
the

I
have
to

relates
to
Rick

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dearest

returned
Mr.
Skimpole
cordially
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
he
ought
not

But
he
is

I
ca
n't
help
it
;
he
is
full
of
youthful
poetry

*NL*
and
I
love
him

If
you
do
n't
like
it
,
I
ca
n't
help
it

I
love
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
engaging
frankness
with
which
he
made
this
declaration
really
had
*NL*
a
disinterested
appearance
and
captivated
my
guardian
,
if
not
,
for
*NL*
the
moment
,
Ada
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
welcome
to
love
him
as
much
as

returned
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
``
but
we
must
save
his
pocket

Harold

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
His
pocket
?
Now
you
are
coming
to
what
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand

''
Taking
a
little
more
claret
and
dipping
one
of
the
*NL*
cakes
in
it
,
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
at
Ada
and
me
with
an
*NL*
ingenuous
foreboding
that
he
never
could
be
made
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
go
with
him
here
or
there
,
''
said
my
guardian
plainly
,
``
you
*NL*
must
not
let
him
pay
for
both

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
''
returned
Mr.
Skimpole
,
his
genial
face
irradiated
*NL*
by
the
comicality
of
this
idea
,
``
what
am
I
to
do

If
he
takes
me
*NL*
anywhere
,
I
must
go

And
how
can
I
pay
?
I
never
have
any
money

If
I
*NL*
had
any
money
,
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it

Suppose
I
say
to
a
*NL*
man

how
much
?
Suppose
the
man
says
to
me
seven
and
sixpence
?
I
know
*NL*
nothing
about
seven
and
sixpence
.
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
pursue
*NL*
the
subject
with
any
consideration
for
the
man

I
do
n't
go
about
*NL*
asking
busy
people
what
seven
and
sixpence
is
in
Moorish
--
which
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand

Why
should
I
go
about
asking
them

sixpence
is
in
Money

which
I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
by
no
means
displeased
with
this
artless
*NL*
reply
,
``
if
you
come
to
any
kind
of
journeying
with
Rick

you
must
*NL*
borrow
the
money

breathing
the

allusion

leave
the
calculation

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

returned
Mr.

,
``
I
will
do
anything

Besides

I
give
you
my

Miss

my

Miss
Summerson

I
*NL*
thought
Mr.

was
immensely
rich

I
thought
he
had
only
to

make
over
something

to
sign
a
bond
,
or
a
draft
,
or
a
cheque

put
something

bring
down
a
shower

of
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it

not

Ada

``
He
is
poor

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

returned
Mr.
Skimpole
with
his
bright
smile
.
``
You

surprise
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
being
the
richer
for
trusting
in
a
rotten
reed

said
my
*NL*
guardian
,
laying
his
hand
emphatically
on
the
sleeve
of
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
's
dressing-gown
,
``
be
you
very
careful
not
to
encourage
him

in
that
reliance

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

returned
Mr.

,
``
and
my

Miss
*NL*
Simmerson

how
can
I
do
that

It
's
business

*NL*

I
do
n't
know
business

It
is
he
who
encourages
me

He
emerges
*NL*
from
great
feats
of
business
,
presents
the
brightest
prospects
before
*NL*
me
as
their
result
,

calls
upon
me
to
admire

I
do
admire

them

as
bright
prospects

But
I
know
no
more
about

and
I
tell
*NL*
him
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
helpless
kind
of
candour
with
which
he
presented
this
before
us
,
*NL*
the
light-hearted
manner
in
which
he
was
amused
by
his
innocence
,
the
*NL*
fantastic
way
in
which
he
took
himself
under
his
own
protection
and
*NL*
argued
about
that
curious
person
,
combined
with
the
delightful
ease
*NL*
of
everything
he
said
exactly
to
make
out
my
guardian
's
case
.
The
*NL*
more
I
saw
of
him
,
the
more
unlikely
it
seemed
to
me
,
when
he
was
*NL*
present
,
that
he
could
design
,
conceal
,
or
influence
anything
;
and
*NL*
yet
the
less
likely
that
appeared
when
he
was
not
present
,
and
the
*NL*
less
agreeable
it
was
to
think
of
his
having
anything
to
do
with
any
*NL*
one
for
whom
I
cared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
his
examination
-LRB-
as
he
called
it
-RRB-
was
now
over
,
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
left
the
room
with
a
radiant
face
to
fetch
his
daughters
*NL*
-LRB-
his
sons
had
run
away
at
various
times
-RRB-
,
leaving
my
guardian
quite
*NL*
delighted
by
the
manner
in
which
he
had
vindicated
his
childish
*NL*
character
.
He
soon
came
back
,
bringing
with
him
the
three
young
*NL*
ladies
and
Mrs.
Skimpole
,
who
had
once
been
a
beauty
but
was
now
a
*NL*
delicate
high-nosed
invalid
suffering
under
a
complication
of
*NL*
disorders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
is
my
Beauty
daughter
,
Arethusa
--
plays
*NL*
and
sings
odds
and
ends
like
her
father

This
is
my
Sentiment
*NL*
daughter
,
Laura
--
plays
a
little
but
do

sing
.
This
is
my
Comedy
*NL*
daughter
,
Kitty
--
sings
a
little
but
do
n't
play
.
We
all
draw
a
little
*NL*
and
compose
a
little
,
and
none
of
us
have
any
idea
of
time
or
money

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Skimpole
sighed
,
I
thought
,
as
if
she
would
have
been
glad
to
*NL*
strike
out
this
item
in
the
family
attainments
.
I
also
thought
that
*NL*
she
rather
impressed
her
sigh
upon
my
guardian
and
that
she
took
*NL*
every
opportunity
of
throwing
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
pleasant
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
turning
his
sprightly
eyes
from
*NL*
one
to
the
other
of
us
,
``
and
it
is
whimsically
interesting
to
trace
*NL*
peculiarities
in
families
.
In
this
family
we
are
all
children

and
I
*NL*
am
the
youngest

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
daughters
,
who
appeared
to
be
very
fond
of
him
,
were
amused
by
*NL*
this
droll
fact
,
particularly
the
Comedy
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dears
,
it
is
true
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
is
it
not
?
So
it
is
,
and
*NL*
so
it
must
be
,
because
like
the
dogs
in
the
hymn
,
`
it
is
our
nature
*NL*
to
.
'
Now
,
here
is
Miss
Summerson
with
a
fine
administrative
capacity
*NL*
and
a
knowledge
of
details
perfectly
surprising
.
It
will
sound
very
*NL*
strange
in
Miss
Summerson
's
ears
,
I
dare
say
,
that
we
know
nothing
*NL*
about
chops
in
this
house
.
But
we
do
n't
,
not
the
least
.
We
ca
n't
cook
*NL*
anything
whatever
.
A
needle
and
thread
we
do
n't
know
how
to
use
.
We
*NL*
admire
the
people
who
possess
the
practical
wisdom
we
want
,
but
we
*NL*
do
n't
quarrel
with
them
.
Then
why
should
they
quarrel
with
us
?
Live
*NL*
and
let
live
,
we
say
to
them
.
Live
upon
your
practical
wisdom
,
and
*NL*
let
us
live
upon
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
,
but
as
usual
seemed
quite
candid
and
really
to
mean
what
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
sympathy
,
my
roses
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
sympathy
for
*NL*
everything
.
Have
we
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
papa
!
''
cried
the
three
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
that
is
our
family
department
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
in
this
*NL*
hurly-burly
of
life
.
We
are
capable
of
looking
on
and
of
being
*NL*
interested
,
and
we
DO
look
on
,
and
we
ARE
interested
.
What
more
can
*NL*
we
do
?
Here
is
my
Beauty
daughter
,
married
these
three
years
.
Now
I
*NL*
dare
say
her
marrying
another
child
,
and
having
two
more
,
was
all
*NL*
wrong
in
point
of
political
economy
,
but
it
was
very
agreeable
.
We
*NL*
had
our
little
festivities
on
those
occasions
and
exchanged
social
*NL*
ideas
.
She
brought
her
young
husband
home
one
day
,
and
they
and
their
*NL*
young
fledglings
have
their
nest
upstairs
.
I
dare
say
at
some
time
or
*NL*
other
Sentiment
and
Comedy
will
bring
THEIR
husbands
home
and
have
*NL*
THEIR
nests
upstairs
too
.
So
we
get
on
,
we
do
n't
know
how
,
but
*NL*
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
very
young
indeed
to
be
the
mother
of
two
children
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
help
pitying
both
her
and
them
.
It
was
evident
that
the
*NL*
three
daughters
had
grown
up
as
they
could
and
had
had
just
as
little
*NL*
haphazard
instruction
as
qualified
them
to
be
their
father
's
*NL*
playthings
in
his
idlest
hours
.
His
pictorial
tastes
were
consulted
,
*NL*
I
observed
,
in
their
respective
styles
of
wearing
their
hair
,
the
*NL*
Beauty
daughter
being
in
the
classic
manner
,
the
Sentiment
daughter
*NL*
luxuriant
and
flowing
,
and
the
Comedy
daughter
in
the
arch
style
,
*NL*
with
a
good
deal
of
sprightly
forehead
,
and
vivacious
little
curls
*NL*
dotted
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
.
They
were
dressed
to
*NL*
correspond
,
though
in
a
most
untidy
and
negligent
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
and
I
conversed
with
these
young
ladies
and
found
them
*NL*
wonderfully
like
their
father
.
In
the
meanwhile
Mr.
Jarndyce
-LRB-
who
had
*NL*
been
rubbing
his
head
to
a
great
extent
,
and
hinted
at
a
change
in
*NL*
the
wind
-RRB-
talked
with
Mrs.
Skimpole
in
a
corner
,
where
we
could
not
*NL*
help
hearing
the
chink
of
money
.
Mr.
Skimpole
had
previously
*NL*
volunteered
to
go
home
with
us
and
had
withdrawn
to
dress
himself
for
*NL*
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
At

Mr.
Skimpole
assented
,
but
*NL*
with
perfect
good
humour
.
``
It
was
coarse
.
There
was
an
absence
of
the
*NL*
finer
touches

in
it

My

taken
great

offence

he
explained
to
us
,
``

an
honest

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Impossible

they
all
three
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
a
rough
kind
of
fellow

a
sort
of
human
hedgehog
rolled
up
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
,
``
who
is
a
baker
in
this
neighbourhood
and
from
whom
we
*NL*
borrowed
a
couple
of
arm-chairs
.
We
wanted
a
couple
of
arm-chairs
,
*NL*
and
we
had
n't
got
them
,
and
therefore
of
course
we
looked
to
a
man
*NL*
who
HAD
got
them
,
to
lend
them
.
Well
!
This
morose
person
lent
them
,
*NL*
and
we
wore
them
out
.
When
they
were
worn
out
,
he
wanted
them
back
.
*NL*
He
had
them
back
.
He
was
contented
,
you
will
say
.
Not
at
all
.
He
*NL*
objected
to
their
being
worn
.
I
reasoned
with
him
,
and
pointed
out
*NL*
his
mistake
.
I
said
,
`
Can
you
,
at
your
time
of
life
,
be
so
*NL*
headstrong
,
my
friend
,
as
to
persist
that
an
arm-chair
is
a
thing
to
*NL*
put
upon
a
shelf
and
look
at
?
That
it
is
an
object
to
contemplate
,
to
*NL*
survey
from
a
distance
,
to
consider
from
a
point
of
sight
?
Do
n't
you
*NL*
KNOW
that
these
arm-chairs
were
borrowed
to
be
sat
upon
?
'
He
was
*NL*
unreasonable
and
unpersuadable
and
used
intemperate
language
.
Being
*NL*
as
patient
as
I
am
at
this
minute
,
I
addressed
another
appeal
to
him
.
*NL*
I
said
,
`
Now
,
my
good
man
,
however
our
business
capacities
may
vary
,
*NL*
we
are
all
children
of
one
great
mother
,
Nature
.
On
this
blooming
*NL*
summer
morning
here
you
see
me
'
-LRB-
I
was
on
the
sofa
-RRB-
`
with
flowers
*NL*
before
me
,
fruit
upon
the
table
,
the
cloudless
sky
above
me
,
the
air
*NL*
full
of
fragrance
,
contemplating
Nature
.
I
entreat
you
,
by
our
common
*NL*
brotherhood
,
not
to
interpose
between
me
and
a
subject
so
sublime
,
*NL*
the
absurd
figure
of
an
angry
baker
!
'
But
he
did
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
*NL*
raising
his
laughing
eyes
in
playful
astonishment
;
``
he
did
interpose
*NL*
that
ridiculous
figure
,
and
he
does
,
and
he
will
again
.
And
therefore
*NL*
I
am
very
glad
to
get
out
of
his
way
and
to
go
home
with
my
friend
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
escape
his
consideration
that
Mrs.
Skimpole
and
the
*NL*
daughters
remained
behind
to
encounter
the
baker
,
but
this
was
so
old
*NL*
a
story
to
all
of
them
that
it
had
become
a
matter
of
course
.
He
took
*NL*
leave
of
his
family
with
a
tenderness
as
airy
and
graceful
as
any
*NL*
other
aspect
in
which
he
showed
himself
and
rode
away
with
us
in
*NL*
perfect
harmony
of
mind
.
We
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
through
some
*NL*
open
doors
,
as
we
went
downstairs
,
that
his
own
apartment
was
a
*NL*
palace
to
the
rest
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
have
no
anticipation
,
and
I
had
none
,
that
something
very
*NL*
startling
to
me
at
the
moment
,
and
ever
memorable
to
me
in
what
*NL*
ensued
from
it
,
was
to
happen
before
this
day
was
out
.
Our
guest
was
*NL*
in
such
spirits
on
the
way
home
that
I
could
do
nothing
but
listen
to
*NL*
him
and
wonder
at
him
;
nor
was
I
alone
in
this
,
for
Ada
yielded
to
*NL*
the
same
fascination
.
As
to
my
guardian
,
the
wind
,
which
had
*NL*
threatened
to
become
fixed
in
the
east
when
we
left
Somers
Town
,
*NL*
veered
completely
round
before
we
were
a
couple
of
miles
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
of
questionable
childishness
or
not
in
any
other
matters
,
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
had
a
child
's
enjoyment
of
change
and
bright
weather
.
In
no
*NL*
way
wearied
by
his
sallies
on
the
road
,
he
was
in
the
drawing-room
*NL*
before
any
of
us
;
and
I
heard
him
at
the
piano
while
I
was
yet
*NL*
looking
after
my
housekeeping
,
singing
refrains
of
barcaroles
and
*NL*
drinking
songs
,
Italian
and
German
,
by
the
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
assembled
shortly
before
dinner
,
and
he
was
still
at
the
*NL*
piano
idly
picking
out
in
his
luxurious
way
little
strains
of
music
,
*NL*
and
talking
between
whiles
of
finishing
some
sketches
of
the
ruined
*NL*
old
Verulam
wall
to-morrow
,
which
he
had
begun
a
year
or
two
ago
and
*NL*
had
got
tired
of
,
when
a
card
was
brought
in
and
my
guardian
read
*NL*
aloud
in
a
surprised
voice
,
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
was
in
the
room
while
it
was
yet
turning
round
with
me
*NL*
and
before
I
had
the
power
to
stir
.
If
I
had
had
it
,
I
should
have
*NL*
hurried
away
.
I
had
not
even
the
presence
of
mind
,
in
my
giddiness
,
*NL*
to
retire
to
Ada
in
the
window
,
or
to
see
the
window
,
or
to
know
*NL*
where
it
was
.
I
heard
my
name
and
found
that
my
guardian
was
*NL*
presenting
me
before
I
could
move
to
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
be
seated
,
Sir
Leicester

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jarndyce

said
Sir
Leicester
in
reply
as
he
bowed
and
seated
*NL*
himself
,
``

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
delicately
dismissed
this
remark
without
making
any
*NL*
verbal
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
given
me
pain

Mr.

Sir

weightily
*NL*
proceeded
.

it

Chesney
Wold
that
a

company

likewise
deterred

such
cause

examining

leisure

Here
he
produced

a
card
and
read

with
much
gravity
and
a
little
trouble

through
his

eye-glass

Sir

even

hoped

have
the
good
fortune

be
at
Chesney

up

I
had
not
seen

had
not
even

appeared
to
myself
to
hear
the
conversation

It
surprises
me
to
find
*NL*
that
I
can
recall
it
,
for
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
on
me
as
it
*NL*
passed
.
I
heard
them
speaking
,
but
my
mind
was
so
confused
and
my
*NL*
instinctive
avoidance
of
this
gentleman
made
his
presence
so
*NL*
distressing
to
me
that
I
thought
I
understood
nothing

through
the
*NL*
rushing
in
my
head

the
beating
of
my
heart

*NL*
``
I
mentioned
the

Sir

rising

accidental

Permit

repeat
to
yourself

these

the
assurance
I

already
tendered
to
Mr.

Circumstances
undoubtedly
prevent
my
saying
that
it
would
afford
me
*NL*
any
gratification
to
hear
that
Mr.
Boythorn
had
favoured
my
house
*NL*
with
his
presence

those
circumstances
are
confined

``
You

*NL*
Sir

Dedlock
coughed
as
if
he
could
not
possibly
hear
*NL*
another
word
in
reference
to
such
an
individual

took
his
leave

great
ceremony

politeness

I
got
to
my
own
room
with
all
*NL*
possible
speed
and
remained
there
until
I
had
recovered
my
*NL*
self-command

It
had
been
very
much
disturbed
,
but
I
was
thankful
to
*NL*
find
when
I
went
downstairs
again
that
they
only
rallied
me
for
*NL*
having
been
shy
and
mute
before
the
great
Lincolnshire
baronet

By
that

up
my

my
guardian
what
I
knew
.
The
possibility
of
my
being
*NL*
brought
into
contact
with
my
mother
,
of
my
being
taken
to
her
house
,
*NL*
even
of
Mr.
Skimpole
's
,
however
distantly
associated
with
me
,
*NL*
receiving
kindnesses
and
obligations
from
her
husband
,
was
so
painful
*NL*
that
I
felt
I
could
no
longer
guide
myself
without
his
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
retired
for
the
night
,
and
Ada
and
I
had
had
our
usual
*NL*
talk
in
our
pretty
room
,
I
went
out
at
my
door
again
and
sought
my
*NL*
guardian
among
his
books
.
I
knew
he
always
read
at
that
hour
,
and
as
*NL*
I
drew
near
I
saw
the
light
shining
out
into
the
passage
from
his
*NL*
reading-lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
in
,
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
little
woman
.
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
the
matter
.
I
thought
I
would
like
to
take
this
quiet
*NL*
time
of
saying
a
word
to
you
about
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
a
chair
for
me
,
shut
his
book
,
and
put
it
by
,
and
turned
his
*NL*
kind
attentive
face
towards
me
.
I
could
not
help
observing
that
it
*NL*
wore
that
curious
expression
I
had
observed
in
it
once
before
--
on
*NL*
that
night
when
he
had
said
that
he
was
in
no
trouble
which
I
could
*NL*
readily
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
concerns
you
,
my
dear
Esther
,
''
said
he
,
``
concerns
us
all
.
You
*NL*
can
not
be
more
ready
to
speak
than
I
am
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
guardian
.
But
I
have
such
need
of
your
advice
and
*NL*
support
.
Oh
!
You
do
n't
know
how
much
need
I
have
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
unprepared
for
my
being
so
earnest
,
and
even
a
little
*NL*
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
how
anxious
I
have
been
to
speak
to
you
,
''
said
I
,
``
ever
since
the
*NL*
visitor
was
here
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
visitor
,
my
dear
!
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
his
arms
and
sat
looking
at
me
with
an
air
of
the
*NL*
profoundest
astonishment
,
awaiting
what
I
should
say
next
.
I
did
not
*NL*
know
how
to
prepare
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Esther
,
''
said
he
,
breaking
into
a
smile
,
``
our
visitor
and
you
*NL*
are
the
two
last
persons
on
earth
I
should
have
thought
of
connecting
*NL*
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
guardian
,
I
know
it
.
And
I
too
,
but
a
little
while
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
passed
from
his
face
,
and
he
became
graver
than
before
.
He
*NL*
crossed
to
the
door
to
see
that
it
was
shut
-LRB-
but
I
had
seen
to
that
-RRB-
*NL*
and
resumed
his
seat
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
do
you
remember
,
when
we
were
overtaken
by
the
*NL*
thunder-storm
,
Lady
Dedlock
's
speaking
to
you
of
her
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
Of
course
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
reminding
you
that
she
and
her
sister
had
differed
,
had
gone
*NL*
their
several
ways
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
they
separate
,
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
quite
altered
as
he
looked
at
me
.
``
My
child
,
what
questions
*NL*
are
these
!
I
never
knew

No
one
but
themselves
ever
did
know

I
*NL*
believe
.
Who
could
tell
what
the
secrets
of
those
two
handsome
and
*NL*
proud
women
were
!
You
have
seen
Lady
Dedlock
.
If
you
had
ever
seen
*NL*
her
sister
,
you
would
know
her
to
have
been
as
resolute
and
haughty
*NL*
as
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
guardian
,
I
have
seen
her
many
and
many
a
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seen
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
a
little
,
biting
his
lip
.
``
Then
,
Esther
,
when
you
spoke
to
*NL*
me
long
ago
of
Boythorn
,
and
when
I
told
you
that
he
was
all
but
*NL*
married
once
,
and
that
the
lady
did
not
die
,
but
died
to
him
,
and
*NL*
that
that
time
had
had
its
influence
on
his
later
life
--
did
you
know
*NL*
it
all
,
and
know
who
the
lady
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
guardian
,
''
I
returned
,
fearful
of
the
light
that
dimly
broke
*NL*
upon
me
.
``
Nor
do
I
know
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Dedlock
's
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
,
''
I
could
scarcely
ask
him
,
``
why
,
guardian
,
pray
tell
me
why
*NL*
were
THEY
parted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
her
act
,
and
she
kept
its
motives
in
her
inflexible
heart
.
He
*NL*
afterwards
did
conjecture
-LRB-
but
it
was
mere
conjecture
-RRB-
that
some
*NL*
injury
which
her
haughty
spirit
had
received
in
her
cause
of
quarrel
*NL*
with
her
sister
had
wounded
her
beyond
all
reason
,
but
she
wrote
him
*NL*
that
from
the
date
of
that
letter
she
died
to
him
--
as
in
literal
*NL*
truth
she
did
--
and
that
the
resolution
was
exacted
from
her
by
her
*NL*
knowledge
of
his
proud
temper
and
his
strained
sense
of
honour
,
which
*NL*
were
both
her
nature
too
.
In
consideration
for
those
master
points
in
*NL*
him
,
and
even
in
consideration
for
them
in
herself
,
she
made
the
*NL*
sacrifice
,
she
said
,
and
would
live
in
it
and
die
in
it
.
She
did
*NL*
both
,
I
fear
;
certainly
he
never
saw
her
,
never
heard
of
her
from
*NL*
that
hour
.
Nor
did
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
guardian
,
what
have
I
done
!
''
I
cried
,
giving
way
to
my
grief
;
*NL*
``
what
sorrow
have
I
innocently
caused
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
caused
,
Esther
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
guardian
.
Innocently
,
but
most
surely
.
That
secluded
sister
is
*NL*
my
first
remembrance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
he
cried
,
starting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
guardian
,
yes
!
And
HER
sister
is
my
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
told
him
all
my
mother
's
letter
,
but
he
would
not
hear
*NL*
it
then
.
He
spoke
so
tenderly
and
wisely
to
me
,
and
he
put
so
plainly
*NL*
before
me
all
I
had
myself
imperfectly
thought
and
hoped
in
my
better
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
that
,
penetrated
as
I
had
been
with
fervent
gratitude
*NL*
towards
him
through
so
many
years
,
I
believed
I
had
never
loved
him
*NL*
so
dearly
,
never
thanked
him
in
my
heart
so
fully
,
as
I
did
that
*NL*
night
.
And
when
he
had
taken
me
to
my
room
and
kissed
me
at
the
door
,
*NL*
and
when
at
last
I
lay
down
to
sleep
,
my
thought
was
how
could
I
ever
*NL*
be
busy
enough
,
how
could
I
ever
be
good
enough
,
how
in
my
little
way
*NL*
could
I
ever
hope
to
be
forgetful
enough
of
myself
,
devoted
enough
to
*NL*
him
,
and
useful
enough
to
others
,
to
show
him
how
I
blessed
and
*NL*
honoured
him

CHAPTER
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Letter
and
the
Answer
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
called
me
into
his
room
next
morning
,
and
then
I
told
him
*NL*
what
had
been
left
untold
on
the
previous
night
.
There
was
nothing
to
*NL*
be
done
,
he
said
,
but
to
keep
the
secret
and
to
avoid
another
such
*NL*
encounter
as
that
of
yesterday
.
He
understood
my
feeling
and
entirely
*NL*
shared
it
.
He
charged
himself
even
with
restraining
Mr.
Skimpole
from
*NL*
improving
his
opportunity
.
One
person
whom
he
need
not
name
to
me
,
it
*NL*
was
not
now
possible
for
him
to
advise
or
help
.
He
wished
it
were
,
*NL*
but
no
such
thing
could
be
.
If
her
mistrust
of
the
lawyer
whom
she
*NL*
had
mentioned
were
well-founded
,
which
he
scarcely
doubted
,
he
*NL*
dreaded
discovery
.
He
knew
something
of
him
,
both
by
sight
and
by
*NL*
reputation
,
and
it
was
certain
that
he
was
a
dangerous
man
.
Whatever
*NL*
happened
,
he
repeatedly
impressed
upon
me
with
anxious
affection
and
*NL*
kindness
,
I
was
as
innocent
of
as
himself
and
as
unable
to
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
do
I
understand
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
any
doubts
tend
towards
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
Much
suspicion
may
exist
without
that
connexion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
lawyer
,
''
I
returned
.
``
But
two
other
persons
have
come
into
*NL*
my
mind
since
I
have
been
anxious
.
Then
I
told
him
all
about
Mr.
*NL*
Guppy
,
who
I
feared
might
have
had
his
vague
surmises
when
I
little
*NL*
understood
his
meaning
,
but
in
whose
silence
after
our
last
interview
*NL*
I
expressed
perfect
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
Then
we
may
dismiss
him
for
the
present
.
*NL*
Who
is
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
called
to
his
recollection
the
French
maid
and
the
eager
offer
of
*NL*
herself
she
had
made
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
he
returned
thoughtfully
.
``
That
is
a
more
alarming
person
than
*NL*
the
clerk
.
But
after
all
,
my
dear
,
it
was
but
seeking
for
a
new
*NL*
service
.
She
had
seen
you
and
Ada
a
little
while
before
,
and
it
was
*NL*
natural
that
you
should
come
into
her
head
.
She
merely
proposed
*NL*
herself
for
your
maid
,
you
know
.
She
did
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
manner
was
strange
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
her
manner
was
strange
when
she
took
her
shoes
off
and
*NL*
showed
that
cool
relish
for
a
walk
that
might
have
ended
in
her
*NL*
death-bed
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
It
would
be
useless
self-distress
and
*NL*
torment
to
reckon
up
such
chances
and
possibilities
.
There
are
very
*NL*
few
harmless
circumstances
that
would
not
seem
full
of
perilous
*NL*
meaning
,
so
considered
.
Be
hopeful
,
little
woman
.
You
can
be
nothing
*NL*
better
than
yourself
;
be
that
,
through
this
knowledge
,
as
you
were
*NL*
before
you
had
it
.
It
is
the
best
you
can
do
for
everybody
's
sake
.
I
,
*NL*
sharing
the
secret
with
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
lightening
it
,
guardian
,
so
much
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
will
be
attentive
to
what
passes
in
that
family
,
so
far
as
I
can
*NL*
observe
it
from
my
distance
.
And
if
the
time
should
come
when
I
can
*NL*
stretch
out
a
hand
to
render
the
least
service
to
one
whom
it
is
*NL*
better
not
to
name
even
here
,
I
will
not
fail
to
do
it
for
her
dear
*NL*
daughter
's
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
with
my
whole
heart
.
What
could
I
ever
do
but
thank
*NL*
him
!
I
was
going
out
at
the
door
when
he
asked
me
to
stay
a
moment
.
*NL*
Quickly
turning
round
,
I
saw
that
same
expression
on
his
face
again
;
*NL*
and
all
at
once
,
I
do
n't
know
how
,
it
flashed
upon
me
as
a
new
and
*NL*
far-off
possibility
that
I
understood
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Esther
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
I
have
long
had
something
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
that
I
have
wished
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
some
difficulty
in
approaching
it
,
and
I
still
have
.
I
*NL*
should
wish
it
to
be
so
deliberately
said
,
and
so
deliberately
*NL*
considered
.
Would
you
object
to
my
writing
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
guardian
,
how
could
I
object
to
your
writing
anything
for
ME
to
*NL*
read
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
see
,
my
love
,
''
said
he
with
his
cheery
smile
,
``
am
I
at
this
*NL*
moment
quite
as
plain
and
easy
--
do
I
seem
as
open
,
as
honest

*NL*
old-fashioned
--
as
I
am
at
any
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
in
all
earnestness
,
``
Quite

''
With
the
strictest
truth
,
for
*NL*
his
momentary
hesitation
was
gone
-LRB-
it
had
not
lasted
a
minute
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
his
fine
,
sensible
,
cordial
,
sterling
manner
was
restored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
look
as
if
I
suppressed
anything
,
meant
anything
but
what
I
*NL*
said
,
had
any
reservation
at
all
,
no
matter
what
?
''
said
he
with
his
*NL*
bright
clear
eyes
on
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
most
assuredly
he
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
fully
trust
me
,
and
thoroughly
rely
on
what
I
profess

*NL*
Esther
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
thoroughly

said
I
with
my
whole
heart

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
girl

returned
my
guardian
,
``
give
me
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
in
his
,
holding
me
lightly
with
his
arm
,
and
looking
down
*NL*
into
my
face
with
the
same
genuine
freshness
and
faithfulness
of
*NL*
manner
--
the
old
protecting
manner
which
had
made
that
house
my
home
*NL*
in
a
moment
--
said
,
``
You

wrought
changes

``
Ah

have
you
done
for
me
since
that
time

said
he

``
Yes
,
Esther
,
''
said
he
with
a
gentle
seriousness
,
``
it
is
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
now
,
to
be
forgotten
for
a
while
.
You
are
only
to
remember
*NL*
now
that
nothing
can
change
me
as
you
know
me
.
Can
you
feel
quite
*NL*
assured
of
that
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
,
and
I
do
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
much
,
''
he
answered
.
``
That
's
everything
.
But
I
must
not
take
*NL*
that
at
a
word
.
I
will
not
write
this
something
in
my
thoughts
until
*NL*
you
have
quite
resolved
within
yourself
that
nothing
can
change
me
as
*NL*
you
know
me
.
If
you
doubt
that
in
the
least
degree
,
I
will
never
*NL*
write
it
.
If
you
are
sure
of
that
,
on
good
consideration
,
send
*NL*
Charley
to
me
this
night
week
--
`
for
the
letter
.
'
But
if
you
are
not
*NL*
quite
certain
,
never
send
.
Mind
,
I
trust
to
your
truth
,
in
this
thing
*NL*
as
in
everything
.
If
you
are
not
quite
certain
on
that
one
point
,
*NL*
never
send
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
already
certain
,
I
can
no
more
be
changed
*NL*
in
that
conviction
than
you
can
be
changed
towards
me
.
I
shall
send
*NL*
Charley
for
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
my
hand
and
said
no
more
.
Nor
was
any
more
said
in
reference
*NL*
to
this
conversation
,
either
by
him
or
me
,
through
the
whole
week
.
*NL*
When
the
appointed
night
came
,
I
said
to
Charley
as
soon
as
I
was
*NL*
alone
,
``
Go
and
knock
at
Mr.
Jarndyce
's
door
,
Charley
,
and
say
you
*NL*
have
come
from
me
--
`
for
the
letter
.
'
''
Charley
went
up
the
stairs
,
and
*NL*
down
the
stairs
,
and
along
the
passages
--
the
zig-zag
way
about
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
house
seemed
very
long
in
my
listening
ears
that
*NL*
night
--
and
so
came
back
,
along
the
passages
,
and
down
the
stairs
,
and
*NL*
up
the
stairs
,
and
brought
the
letter
.
``
Lay
it
on
the
table
,
*NL*
Charley
,
''
said
I
.
So
Charley
laid
it
on
the
table
and
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
and
I
sat
looking
at
it
without
taking
it
up
,
thinking
of
many
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
with
my
overshadowed
childhood
,
and
passed
through
those
*NL*
timid
days
to
the
heavy
time
when
my
aunt
lay
dead
,
with
her
resolute
*NL*
face
so
cold
and
set
,
and
when
I
was
more
solitary
with
Mrs.
Rachael
*NL*
than
if
I
had
had
no
one
in
the
world
to
speak
to
or
to
look
at
.
I
*NL*
passed
to
the
altered
days
when
I
was
so
blest
as
to
find
friends
in
*NL*
all
around
me
,
and
to
be
beloved
.
I
came
to
the
time
when
I
first
saw
*NL*
my
dear
girl
and
was
received
into
that
sisterly
affection
which
was
*NL*
the
grace
and
beauty
of
my
life
.
I
recalled
the
first
bright
gleam
of
*NL*
welcome
which
had
shone
out
of
those
very
windows
upon
our
expectant
*NL*
faces
on
that
cold
bright
night
,
and
which
had
never
paled
.
I
lived
*NL*
my
happy
life
there
over
again
,
I
went
through
my
illness
and
*NL*
recovery
,
I
thought
of
myself
so
altered
and
of
those
around
me
so
*NL*
unchanged
;
and
all
this
happiness
shone
like
a
light
from
one
central
*NL*
figure
,
represented
before
me
by
the
letter
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
opened
it
and
read
it
.
It
was
so
impressive
in
its
love
for
me
,
and
*NL*
in
the
unselfish
caution
it
gave
me
,
and
the
consideration
it
showed
*NL*
for
me
in
every
word
,
that
my
eyes
were
too
often
blinded
to
read
*NL*
much
at
a
time
.
But
I
read
it
through
three
times
before
I
laid
it
*NL*
down
.
I
had
thought
beforehand
that
I
knew
its
purport
,
and
I
did
.
It
*NL*
asked
me
,
would
I
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
love
letter
,
though
it
expressed
so
much
love
,
but
was
*NL*
written
just
as
he
would
at
any
time
have
spoken
to
me
.
I
saw
his
*NL*
face
,
and
heard
his
voice
,
and
felt
the
influence
of
his
kind
*NL*
protecting
manner
in
every
line
.
It
addressed
me
as
if
our
places
*NL*
were
reversed
,
as
if
all
the
good
deeds
had
been
mine
and
all
the
*NL*
feelings
they
had
awakened
his
.
It
dwelt
on
my
being
young
,
and
he
*NL*
past
the
prime
of
life
;
on
his
having
attained
a
ripe
age
,
while
I
*NL*
was
a
child
;
on
his
writing
to
me
with
a
silvered
head
,
and
knowing
*NL*
all
this
so
well
as
to
set
it
in
full
before
me
for
mature
*NL*
deliberation
.
It
told
me
that
I
would
gain
nothing
by
such
a
marriage
*NL*
and
lose
nothing
by
rejecting
it
,
for
no
new
relation
could
enhance
*NL*
the
tenderness
in
which
he
held
me
,
and
whatever
my
decision
was
,
he
*NL*
was
certain
it
would
be
right
.
But
he
had
considered
this
step
anew
*NL*
since
our
late
confidence
and
had
decided
on
taking
it
,
if
it
only
*NL*
served
to
show
me
through
one
poor
instance
that
the
whole
world
*NL*
would
readily
unite
to
falsify
the
stern
prediction
of
my
childhood
.
*NL*
I
was
the
last
to
know
what
happiness
I
could
bestow
upon
him
,
but
of
*NL*
that
he
said
no
more
,
for
I
was
always
to
remember
that
I
owed
him
*NL*
nothing
and
that
he
was
my
debtor
,
and
for
very
much
.
He
had
often
*NL*
thought
of
our
future
,
and
foreseeing
that
the
time
must
come
,
and
*NL*
fearing
that
it
might
come
soon
,
when
Ada
-LRB-
now
very
nearly
of
age
-RRB-
*NL*
would
leave
us
,
and
when
our
present
mode
of
life
must
be
broken
up
,
*NL*
had
become
accustomed
to
reflect
on
this
proposal
.
Thus
he
made
it
.
*NL*
If
I
felt
that
I
could
ever
give
him
the
best
right
he
could
have
to
*NL*
be
my
protector
,
and
if
I
felt
that
I
could
happily
and
justly
become
*NL*
the
dear
companion
of
his
remaining
life
,
superior
to
all
lighter
*NL*
chances
and
changes
than
death
,
even
then
he
could
not
have
me
bind
*NL*
myself
irrevocably
while
this
letter
was
yet
so
new
to
me
,
but
even
*NL*
then
I
must
have
ample
time
for
reconsideration
.
In
that
case
,
or
in
*NL*
the
opposite
case
,
let
him
be
unchanged
in
his
old
relation
,
in
his
*NL*
old
manner
,
in
the
old
name
by
which
I
called
him
.
And
as
to
his
*NL*
bright
Dame
Durden
and
little
housekeeper
,
she
would
ever
be
the
*NL*
same
,
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
substance
of
the
letter
,
written
throughout
with
a
*NL*
justice
and
a
dignity
as
if
he
were
indeed
my
responsible
guardian
*NL*
impartially
representing
the
proposal
of
a
friend
against
whom
in
his
*NL*
integrity
he
stated
the
full
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
hint
to
me
that
when
I
had
been
better
looking
he
had
*NL*
had
this
same
proceeding
in
his
thoughts
and
had
refrained
from
it
.
*NL*
That
when
my
old
face
was
gone
from
me
,
and
I
had
no
attractions
,
he
*NL*
could
love
me
just
as
well
as
in
my
fairer
days
.
That
the
discovery
*NL*
of
my
birth
gave
him
no
shock
.
That
his
generosity
rose
above
my
*NL*
disfigurement
and
my
inheritance
of
shame
.
That
the
more
I
stood
in
*NL*
need
of
such
fidelity
,
the
more
firmly
I
might
trust
in
him
to
the
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
knew
it
,
I
knew
it
well
now
.
It
came
upon
me
as
the
close
of
*NL*
the
benignant
history
I
had
been
pursuing
,
and
I
felt
that
I
had
but
*NL*
one
thing
to
do
.
To
devote
my
life
to
his
happiness
was
to
thank
him
*NL*
poorly
,
and
what
had
I
wished
for
the
other
night
but
some
new
means
*NL*
of
thanking
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
Still
I
cried
very
much
,
not
only
in
the
fullness
of
my
heart
after
*NL*
reading
the
letter
,
not
only
in
the
strangeness
of
the
prospect
--
for
*NL*
it
was
strange
though
I
had
expected
the
contents
--
but
as
if
*NL*
something
for
which
there
was
no
name
or
distinct
idea
were
*NL*
indefinitely
lost
to
me
.
I
was
very
happy
,
very
thankful
,
very
*NL*
hopeful
;
but
I
cried
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
I
went
to
my
old
glass
.
My
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
,
and
I
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
,
Esther
,
Esther
,
can
that
be
you
!
''
I
am
afraid
the
face
in
*NL*
the
glass
was
going
to
cry
again
at
this
reproach
,
but
I
held
up
my
*NL*
finger
at
it
,
and
it
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
more
like
the
composed
look
you
comforted
me
with
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
when
you
showed
me
such
a
change
!
''
said
I
,
beginning
to
let
down
my
*NL*
hair
.
``
When
you
are
mistress
of
Bleak
House
,
you
are
to
be
as
*NL*
cheerful
as
a
bird
.
In
fact
,
you
are
always
to
be
cheerful
;
so
let
us
*NL*
begin
for
once
and
for
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
on
with
my
hair
now
,
quite
comfortably
.
I
sobbed
a
little
*NL*
still
,
but
that
was
because
I
had
been
crying
,
not
because
I
was
*NL*
crying
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
Esther
,
my
dear
,
you
are
happy
for
life
.
Happy
with
your
best
*NL*
friends
,
happy
in
your
old
home
,
happy
in
the
power
of
doing
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
good
,
and
happy
in
the
undeserved
love
of
the
best
of
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
,
all
at
once
,
if
my
guardian
had
married
some
one
else
,
how
*NL*
should
I
have
felt
,
and
what
should
I
have
done
!
That
would
have
been
*NL*
a
change
indeed
.
It
presented
my
life
in
such
a
new
and
blank
form
*NL*
that
I
rang
my
housekeeping
keys
and
gave
them
a
kiss
before
I
laid
*NL*
them
down
in
their
basket
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
went
on
to
think
,
as
I
dressed
my
hair
before
the
glass
,
how
*NL*
often
had
I
considered
within
myself
that
the
deep
traces
of
my
*NL*
illness
and
the
circumstances
of
my
birth
were
only
new
reasons
why
I
*NL*
should
be
busy
,
busy
,
busy
--
useful
,
amiable
,
serviceable
,
in
all
*NL*
honest
,
unpretending
ways
.
This
was
a
good
time
,
to
be
sure
,
to
sit
*NL*
down
morbidly
and
cry
!
As
to
its
seeming
at
all
strange
to
me
at
*NL*
first
-LRB-
if
that
were
any
excuse
for
crying
,
which
it
was
not
-RRB-
that
I
*NL*
was
one
day
to
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
,
why
should
it
seem
*NL*
strange
?
Other
people
had
thought
of
such
things
,
if
I
had
not
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
remember
,
my
plain
dear
,
''
I
asked
myself
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
glass
,
``
what
Mrs.
Woodcourt
said
before
those
scars
were
there
about
*NL*
your
marrying
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
name
brought
them
to
my
remembrance
.
The
dried
remains
of
*NL*
the
flowers
.
It
would
be
better
not
to
keep
them
now
.
They
had
only
*NL*
been
preserved
in
memory
of
something
wholly
past
and
gone
,
but
it
*NL*
would
be
better
not
to
keep
them
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
a
book
,
and
it
happened
to
be
in
the
next
room
--
our
*NL*
sitting-room
,
dividing
Ada
's
chamber
from
mine
.
I
took
a
candle
and
*NL*
went
softly
in
to
fetch
it
from
its
shelf
.
After
I
had
it
in
my
hand
,
*NL*
I
saw
my
beautiful
darling
,
through
the
open
door
,
lying
asleep
,
and
*NL*
I
stole
in
to
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
weak
in
me
,
I
know
,
and
I
could
have
no
reason
for
crying
;
but
*NL*
I
dropped
a
tear
upon
her
dear
face
,
and
another
,
and
another
.
Weaker
*NL*
than
that
,
I
took
the
withered
flowers
out
and
put
them
for
a
moment
*NL*
to
her
lips
.
I
thought
about
her
love
for
Richard
,
though
,
indeed
,
*NL*
the
flowers
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
.
Then
I
took
them
into
my
own
*NL*
room
and
burned
them
at
the
candle
,
and
they
were
dust
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
breakfast-room
next
morning
,
I
found
my
guardian
just
*NL*
as
usual
,
quite
as
frank
,
as
open
,
and
free
.
There
being
not
the
*NL*
least
constraint
in
his
manner
,
there
was
none
-LRB-
or
I
think
there
was
*NL*
none
-RRB-
in
mine
.
I
was
with
him
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
in
and
out
,
when
there
was
no
one
there
,
and
I
thought
it
*NL*
not
unlikely
that
he
might
speak
to
me
about
the
letter
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
say
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
on
the
next
morning
,
and
the
next
,
and
for
at
least
a
week
,
over
*NL*
which
time
Mr.
Skimpole
prolonged
his
stay
.
I
expected
,
every
day
,
*NL*
that
my
guardian
might
speak
to
me
about
the
letter
,
but
he
never
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
then
,
growing
uneasy
,
that
I
ought
to
write
an
answer
.
I
*NL*
tried
over
and
over
again
in
my
own
room
at
night
,
but
I
could
not
*NL*
write
an
answer
that
at
all
began
like
a
good
answer
,
so
I
thought
*NL*
each
night
I
would
wait
one
more
day
.
And
I
waited
seven
more
days
,
*NL*
and
he
never
said
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
Mr.
Skimpole
having
departed
,
we
three
were
one
afternoon
*NL*
going
out
for
a
ride
;
and
I
,
being
dressed
before
Ada
and
going
down
,
*NL*
came
upon
my
guardian
,
with
his
back
towards
me
,
standing
at
the
*NL*
drawing-room
window
looking
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
on
my
coming
in
and
said
,
smiling
,
``
Aye
,
it
's
you
,
little
*NL*
woman
,
is
it
?
''
and
looked
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
him
now
.
In
short
,
I
had
come
down
*NL*
on
purpose
.
``
Guardian
,
''
I
said
,
rather
hesitating
and
trembling
,
*NL*
``
when
would
you
like
to
have
the
answer
to
the
letter
Charley
came
*NL*
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
it
's
ready
,
my
dear
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
ready
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Charley
to
bring
it
?
''
he
asked
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
have
brought
it
myself
,
guardian
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
two
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
,
and
he
said
was
this
*NL*
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
,
and
I
said
yes
;
and
it
made
no
*NL*
difference
presently
,
and
we
all
went
out
together
,
and
I
said
*NL*
nothing
to
my
precious
pet
about
it
.

CHAPTER
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
In
Trust
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
when
I
had
done
jingling
about
with
my
baskets
of
keys
,
*NL*
as
my
beauty
and
I
were
walking
round
and
round
the
garden
I
happened
*NL*
to
turn
my
eyes
towards
the
house
and
saw
a
long
thin
shadow
going
in
*NL*
which
looked
like
Mr.
Vholes
.
Ada
had
been
telling
me
only
that
*NL*
morning
of
her
hopes
that
Richard
might
exhaust
his
ardour
in
the
*NL*
Chancery
suit
by
being
so
very
earnest
in
it
;
and
therefore
,
not
to
*NL*
damp
my
dear
girl
's
spirits
,
I
said
nothing
about
Mr.
Vholes
's
*NL*
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
came
Charley
,
lightly
winding
among
the
bushes
and
tripping
*NL*
along
the
paths
,
as
rosy
and
pretty
as
one
of
Flora
's
attendants
*NL*
instead
of
my
maid
,
saying
,
``
Oh
,
if
you
please
,
miss
,
would
you
step
*NL*
and
speak
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
Charley
's
peculiarities
that
whenever
she
was
charged
*NL*
with
a
message
she
always
began
to
deliver
it
as
soon
as
she
beheld
,
*NL*
at
any
distance
,
the
person
for
whom
it
was
intended
.
Therefore
I
saw
*NL*
Charley
asking
me
in
her
usual
form
of
words
to
``
step
and
speak
''
to
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
long
before
I
heard
her
.
And
when
I
did
hear
her
,
she
*NL*
had
said
it
so
often
that
she
was
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
Ada
I
would
make
haste
back
and
inquired
of
Charley
as
we
went
*NL*
in
whether
there
was
not
a
gentleman
with
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
To
which
*NL*
Charley
,
whose
grammar
,
I
confess
to
my
shame
,
never
did
any
credit
*NL*
to
my
educational
powers
,
replied
,
``
Yes
,
miss
.
Him
as
come
down
in
*NL*
the
country
with
Mr.
Richard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
more
complete
contrast
than
my
guardian
and
Mr.
Vholes
I
suppose
*NL*
there
could
not
be
.
I
found
them
looking
at
one
another
across
a
*NL*
table
,
the
one
so
open
and
the
other
so
close
,
the
one
so
broad
and
*NL*
upright
and
the
other
so
narrow
and
stooping
,
the
one
giving
out
what
*NL*
he
had
to
say
in
such
a
rich
ringing
voice
and
the
other
keeping
it
*NL*
in
in
such
a
cold-blooded
,
gasping
,
fish-like
manner
that
I
thought
I
*NL*
never
had
seen
two
people
so
unmatched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Mr.
Vholes
,
my
dear
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
Not
with
the
*NL*
greatest
urbanity
,
I
must
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
rose
,
gloved
and
buttoned
up
as
usual
,
and
seated
himself
*NL*
again
,
just
as
he
had
seated
himself
beside
Richard
in
the
gig
.
Not
*NL*
having
Richard
to
look
at
,
he
looked
straight
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Vholes
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
eyeing
his
black
figure
as
if
he
were
*NL*
a
bird
of
ill
omen
,
``
has
brought
an
ugly
report
of
our
most
*NL*
unfortunate
Rick
.
''
Laying
a
marked
emphasis
on
``
most
unfortunate
''
as
*NL*
if
the
words
were
rather
descriptive
of
his
connexion
with
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
between
them
;
Mr.
Vholes
remained
immovable
,
except
that
*NL*
he
secretly
picked
at
one
of
the
red
pimples
on
his
yellow
face
with
*NL*
his
black
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
Rick
and
you
are
happily
good
friends
,
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
what
you
think
,
my
dear
.
Would
you
be
so
*NL*
good
as
to
--
as
to
speak
up
,
Mr.
Vholes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Doing
anything
but
that
,
Mr.
Vholes
observed
,
``
I
have
been
saying
*NL*
that
I
have
reason
to
know
,
Miss
Summerson
,
as
Mr.
C.
's
professional
*NL*
adviser
,
that
Mr.
C.
's
circumstances
are
at
the
present
moment
in
an
*NL*
embarrassed
state
.
Not
so
much
in
point
of
amount
as
owing
to
the
*NL*
peculiar
and
pressing
nature
of
liabilities
Mr.
C.
has
incurred
and
*NL*
the
means
he
has
of
liquidating
or
meeting
the
same
.
I
have
staved
*NL*
off
many
little
matters
for
Mr.
C.
,
but
there
is
a
limit
to
staving
*NL*
off
,
and
we
have
reached
it
.
I
have
made
some
advances
out
of
pocket
*NL*
to
accommodate
these
unpleasantnesses
,
but
I
necessarily
look
to
*NL*
being
repaid
,
for
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
man
of
capital
,
and
I
have
*NL*
a
father
to
support
in
the
Vale
of
Taunton
,
besides
striving
to
*NL*
realize
some
little
independence
for
three
dear
girls
at
home
.
My
*NL*
apprehension
is
,
Mr.
C.
's
circumstances
being
such
,
lest
it
should
*NL*
end
in
his
obtaining
leave
to
part
with
his
commission
,
which
at
all
*NL*
events
is
desirable
to
be
made
known
to
his
connexions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
,
who
had
looked
at
me
while
speaking
,
here
emerged
into
*NL*
the
silence
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
broken
,
so
stifled
was
*NL*
his
tone
,
and
looked
before
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagine
the
poor
fellow
without
even
his
present
resource
,
''
said
my
*NL*
guardian
to
me
.
``
Yet
what
can
I
do
?
You
know
him
,
Esther
.
He
would
*NL*
never
accept
of
help
from
me
now
.
To
offer
it
or
hint
at
it
would
be
*NL*
to
drive
him
to
an
extremity
,
if
nothing
else
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
hereupon
addressed
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Mr.
Jarndyce
remarks
,
miss
,
is
no
doubt
the
case
,
and
is
the
*NL*
difficulty
.
I
do
not
see
that
anything
is
to
be
done
.
I
do
not
say
*NL*
that
anything
is
to
be
done
.
Far
from
it
.
I
merely
come
down
here
*NL*
under
the
seal
of
confidence
and
mention
it
in
order
that
everything
*NL*
may
be
openly
carried
on
and
that
it
may
not
be
said
afterwards
that
*NL*
everything
was
not
openly
carried
on
.
My
wish
is
that
everything
*NL*
should
be
openly
carried
on
.
I
desire
to
leave
a
good
name
behind
me
.
*NL*
If
I
consulted
merely
my
own
interests
with
Mr.
C.
,
I
should
not
be
*NL*
here
.
So
insurmountable
,
as
you
must
well
know
,
would
be
his
*NL*
objections
.
This
is
not
a
professional
attendance
.
This
can
he
*NL*
charged
to
nobody
.
I
have
no
interest
in
it
except
as
a
member
of
*NL*
society
and
a
father
--
AND
a
son
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
,
who
had
nearly
*NL*
forgotten
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
us
that
Mr.
Vholes
said
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
*NL*
truth
in
intimating
that
he
sought
to
divide
the
responsibility
,
such
*NL*
as
it
was
,
of
knowing
Richard
's
situation
.
I
could
only
suggest
that
*NL*
I
should
go
down
to
Deal
,
where
Richard
was
then
stationed
,
and
see
*NL*
him
,
and
try
if
it
were
possible
to
avert
the
worst
.
Without
*NL*
consulting
Mr.
Vholes
on
this
point
,
I
took
my
guardian
aside
to
*NL*
propose
it
,
while
Mr.
Vholes
gauntly
stalked
to
the
fire
and
warmed
*NL*
his
funeral
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fatigue
of
the
journey
formed
an
immediate
objection
on
my
*NL*
guardian
's
part
,
but
as
I
saw
he
had
no
other
,
and
as
I
was
only
too
*NL*
happy
to
go
,
I
got
his
consent
.
We
had
then
merely
to
dispose
of
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
``
Miss
Summerson
will
communicate
with
*NL*
Mr.
Carstone
,
and
you
can
only
hope
that
his
position
may
be
yet
*NL*
retrievable
.
You
will
allow
me
to
order
you
lunch
after
your
journey
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
,
putting
out
his
long
*NL*
black
sleeve
to
check
the
ringing
of
the
bell
,
``
not
any
.
I
thank
you
,
*NL*
no
,
not
a
morsel
.
My
digestion
is
much
impaired
,
and
I
am
but
a
poor
*NL*
knife
and
fork
at
any
time
.
If
I
was
to
partake
of
solid
food
at
this
*NL*
period
of
the
day
,
I
do
n't
know
what
the
consequences
might
be
.
*NL*
Everything
having
been
openly
carried
on
,
sir
,
I
will
now
with
your
*NL*
permission
take
my
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
would
that
you
could
take
your
leave
,
and
we
could
all
take
*NL*
our
leave
,
Mr.
Vholes
,
''
returned
my
guardian
bitterly
,
``
of
a
cause
*NL*
you
know
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
,
whose
black
dye
was
so
deep
from
head
to
foot
that
it
had
*NL*
quite
steamed
before
the
fire
,
diffusing
a
very
unpleasant
perfume
,
*NL*
made
a
short
one-sided
inclination
of
his
head
from
the
neck
and
*NL*
slowly
shook
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
whose
ambition
it
is
to
be
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
*NL*
respectable
practitioners
,
sir
,
can
but
put
our
shoulders
to
the
*NL*
wheel
.
We
do
it
,
sir
.
At
least
,
I
do
it
myself
;
and
I
wish
to
think
*NL*
well
of
my
professional
brethren
,
one
and
all
.
You
are
sensible
of
an
*NL*
obligation
not
to
refer
to
me
,
miss
,
in
communicating
with
Mr.
C.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
would
be
careful
not
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
miss
.
Good
morning
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
good
morning
,
sir
.
''
Mr.
*NL*
Vholes
put
his
dead
glove
,
which
scarcely
seemed
to
have
any
hand
in
*NL*
it
,
on
my
fingers
,
and
then
on
my
guardian
's
fingers
,
and
took
his
*NL*
long
thin
shadow
away
.
I
thought
of
it
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
,
*NL*
passing
over
all
the
sunny
landscape
between
us
and
London
,
chilling
*NL*
the
seed
in
the
ground
as
it
glided
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
became
necessary
to
tell
Ada
where
I
was
going
and
why
I
*NL*
was
going
,
and
of
course
she
was
anxious
and
distressed
.
But
she
was
*NL*
too
true
to
Richard
to
say
anything
but
words
of
pity
and
words
of
*NL*
excuse
,
and
in
a
more
loving
spirit
still
--
my
dear
devoted
girl
!
--
she
*NL*
wrote
him
a
long
letter
,
of
which
I
took
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
was
to
be
my
travelling
companion
,
though
I
am
sure
I
wanted
*NL*
none
and
would
willingly
have
left
her
at
home
.
We
all
went
to
London
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
and
finding
two
places
in
the
mail
,
secured
them
.
At
*NL*
our
usual
bed-time
,
Charley
and
I
were
rolling
away
seaward
with
the
*NL*
Kentish
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
night
's
journey
in
those
coach
times
,
but
we
had
the
mail
to
*NL*
ourselves
and
did
not
find
the
night
very
tedious
.
It
passed
with
me
*NL*
as
I
suppose
it
would
with
most
people
under
such
circumstances
.
At
*NL*
one
while
my
journey
looked
hopeful
,
and
at
another
hopeless
.
Now
I
*NL*
thought
I
should
do
some
good
,
and
now
I
wondered
how
I
could
ever
*NL*
have
supposed
so
.
Now
it
seemed
one
of
the
most
reasonable
things
in
*NL*
the
world
that
I
should
have
come
,
and
now
one
of
the
most
*NL*
unreasonable
.
In
what
state
I
should
find
Richard
,
what
I
should
say
*NL*
to
him
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
me
occupied
my
mind
by
turns
with
*NL*
these
two
states
of
feeling
;
and
the
wheels
seemed
to
play
one
tune
*NL*
-LRB-
to
which
the
burden
of
my
guardian
's
letter
set
itself
-RRB-
over
and
*NL*
over
again
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
came
into
the
narrow
streets
of
Deal
,
and
very
gloomy
they
*NL*
were
upon
a
raw
misty
morning
.
The
long
flat
beach
,
with
its
little
*NL*
irregular
houses
,
wooden
and
brick
,
and
its
litter
of
capstans
,
and
*NL*
great
boats
,
and
sheds
,
and
bare
upright
poles
with
tackle
and
*NL*
blocks
,
and
loose
gravelly
waste
places
overgrown
with
grass
and
*NL*
weeds
,
wore
as
dull
an
appearance
as
any
place
I
ever
saw
.
The
sea
*NL*
was
heaving
under
a
thick
white
fog
;
and
nothing
else
was
moving
but
*NL*
a
few
early
ropemakers
,
who
,
with
the
yarn
twisted
round
their
*NL*
bodies
,
looked
as
if
,
tired
of
their
present
state
of
existence
,
they
*NL*
were
spinning
themselves
into
cordage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
we
got
into
a
warm
room
in
an
excellent
hotel
and
sat
down
,
*NL*
comfortably
washed
and
dressed
,
to
an
early
breakfast
-LRB-
for
it
was
too
*NL*
late
to
think
of
going
to
bed
-RRB-
,
Deal
began
to
look
more
cheerful
.
Our
*NL*
little
room
was
like
a
ship
's
cabin
,
and
that
delighted
Charley
very
*NL*
much
.
Then
the
fog
began
to
rise
like
a
curtain
,
and
numbers
of
ships
*NL*
that
we
had
had
no
idea
were
near
appeared
.
I
do
n't
know
how
many
*NL*
sail
the
waiter
told
us
were
then
lying
in
the
downs
.
Some
of
these
*NL*
vessels
were
of
grand
size
--
one
was
a
large
Indiaman
just
come
home
;
*NL*
and
when
the
sun
shone
through
the
clouds
,
making
silvery
pools
in
*NL*
the
dark
sea
,
the
way
in
which
these
ships
brightened
,
and
shadowed
,
*NL*
and
changed
,
amid
a
bustle
of
boats
pulling
off
from
the
shore
to
*NL*
them
and
from
them
to
the
shore
,
and
a
general
life
and
motion
in
*NL*
themselves
and
everything
around
them
,
was
most
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
large
Indiaman
was
our
great
attraction
because
she
had
come
into
*NL*
the
downs
in
the
night
.
She
was
surrounded
by
boats
,
and
we
said
how
*NL*
glad
the
people
on
board
of
her
must
be
to
come
ashore
.
Charley
was
*NL*
curious
,
too
,
about
the
voyage
,
and
about
the
heat
in
India
,
and
the
*NL*
serpents
and
the
tigers
;
and
as
she
picked
up
such
information
much
*NL*
faster
than
grammar
,
I
told
her
what
I
knew
on
those
points
.
I
told
*NL*
her
,
too
,
how
people
in
such
voyages
were
sometimes
wrecked
and
cast
*NL*
on
rocks
,
where
they
were
saved
by
the
intrepidity
and
humanity
of
*NL*
one
man
.
And
Charley
asking
how
that
could
be
,
I
told
her
how
we
knew
*NL*
at
home
of
such
a
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
thought
of
sending
Richard
a
note
saying
I
was
there
,
but
it
*NL*
seemed
so
much
better
to
go
to
him
without
preparation
.
As
he
lived
*NL*
in
barracks
I
was
a
little
doubtful
whether
this
was
feasible
,
but
we
*NL*
went
out
to
reconnoitre
.
Peeping
in
at
the
gate
of
the
barrack-yard
,
*NL*
we
found
everything
very
quiet
at
that
time
in
the
morning
,
and
I
*NL*
asked
a
sergeant
standing
on
the
guardhouse-steps
where
he
lived
.
He
*NL*
sent
a
man
before
to
show
me
,
who
went
up
some
bare
stairs
,
and
*NL*
knocked
with
his
knuckles
at
a
door
,
and
left
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
!
''
cried
Richard
from
within
.
So
I
left
Charley
in
the
*NL*
little
passage
,
and
going
on
to
the
half-open
door
,
said
,
``
Can
I
come
*NL*
in
,
Richard
?
It
's
only
Dame
Durden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
writing
at
a
table
,
with
a
great
confusion
of
clothes
,
tin
*NL*
cases
,
books
,
boots
,
brushes
,
and
portmanteaus
strewn
all
about
the
*NL*
floor
.
He
was
only
half
dressed
--
in
plain
clothes
,
I
observed
,
not
in
*NL*
uniform
--
and
his
hair
was
unbrushed
,
and
he
looked
as
wild
as
his
*NL*
room
.
All
this
I
saw
after
he
had
heartily
welcomed
me
and
I
was
*NL*
seated
near
him
,
for
he
started
upon
hearing
my
voice
and
caught
me
*NL*
in
his
arms
in
a
moment
.
Dear
Richard
!
He
was
ever
the
same
to
me
.
*NL*
Down
to
--
ah
,
poor
poor
fellow
!
--
to
the
end
,
he
never
received
me
but
*NL*
with
something
of
his
old
merry
boyish
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heaven
,
my
dear
little
woman
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
do
you
come
here
?
*NL*
Who
could
have
thought
of
seeing
you
!
Nothing
the
matter
?
Ada
is
*NL*
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
well
.
Lovelier
than
ever
,
Richard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
said
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
.
``
My
poor
cousin
!
I
was
*NL*
writing
to
you
,
Esther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
worn
and
haggard
as
he
looked
,
even
in
the
fullness
of
his
*NL*
handsome
youth
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
crushing
the
closely
*NL*
written
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
at
the
trouble
of
writing
all
that
,
and
am
I
not
to
*NL*
read
it
after
all
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
''
he
returned
with
a
hopeless
gesture
.
``
You
may
read
it
*NL*
in
the
whole
room
.
It
is
all
over
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
mildly
entreated
him
not
to
be
despondent
.
I
told
him
that
I
had
*NL*
heard
by
chance
of
his
being
in
difficulty
and
had
come
to
consult
*NL*
with
him
what
could
best
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
you
,
Esther
,
but
useless
,
and
so
NOT
like
you
!
''
said
he
with
a
*NL*
melancholy
smile
.
``
I
am
away
on
leave
this
day
--
should
have
been
gone
*NL*
in
another
hour
--
and
that
is
to
smooth
it
over
,
for
my
selling
out
.
*NL*
Well
!
Let
bygones
be
bygones
.
So
this
calling
follows
the
rest
.
I
*NL*
only
want
to
have
been
in
the
church
to
have
made
the
round
of
all
*NL*
the
professions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
,
''
I
urged
,
``
it
is
not
so
hopeless
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
''
he
returned
,
``
it
is
indeed
.
I
am
just
so
near
disgrace
as
*NL*
that
those
who
are
put
in
authority
over
me
-LRB-
as
the
catechism
goes
-RRB-
*NL*
would
far
rather
be
without
me
than
with
me
.
And
they
are
right
.
*NL*
Apart
from
debts
and
duns
and
all
such
drawbacks
,
I
am
not
fit
even
*NL*
for
this
employment
.
I
have
no
care
,
no
mind
,
no
heart
,
no
soul
,
but
*NL*
for
one
thing
.
Why
,
if
this
bubble
had
n't
broken
now
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
tearing
the
letter
he
had
written
into
fragments
and
moodily
casting
*NL*
them
away
,
by
driblets
,
``
how
could
I
have
gone
abroad
?
I
must
have
*NL*
been
ordered
abroad
,
but
how
could
I
have
gone
?
How
could
I
,
with
my
*NL*
experience
of
that
thing
,
trust
even
Vholes
unless
I
was
at
his
*NL*
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
he
knew
by
my
face
what
I
was
about
to
say
,
but
he
caught
*NL*
the
hand
I
had
laid
upon
his
arm
and
touched
my
own
lips
with
it
to
*NL*
prevent
me
from
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Dame
Durden
!
Two
subjects
I
forbid
--
must
forbid
.
The
first
is
*NL*
John
Jarndyce
.
The
second
,
you
know
what
.
Call
it
madness
,
and
I
tell
*NL*
you
I
ca
n't
help
it
now
,
and
ca
n't
be
sane
.
But
it
is
no
such
thing
;
*NL*
it
is
the
one
object
I
have
to
pursue
.
It
is
a
pity
I
ever
was
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
turn
out
of
my
road
for
any
other
.
It
would
be
*NL*
wisdom
to
abandon
it
now
,
after
all
the
time
,
anxiety
,
and
pains
I
*NL*
have
bestowed
upon
it
!
Oh
,
yes
,
true
wisdom
.
It
would
be
very
*NL*
agreeable
,
too
,
to
some
people
;
but
I
never
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
that
mood
in
which
I
thought
it
best
not
to
increase
his
*NL*
determination
-LRB-
if
anything
could
increase
it
-RRB-
by
opposing
him
.
I
took
*NL*
out
Ada
's
letter
and
put
it
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
read
it
now
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
told
him
yes
,
he
laid
it
on
the
table
,
and
resting
his
head
upon
*NL*
his
hand
,
began
.
He
had
not
read
far
when
he
rested
his
head
upon
his
*NL*
two
hands
--
to
hide
his
face
from
me
.
In
a
little
while
he
rose
as
if
*NL*
the
light
were
bad
and
went
to
the
window
.
He
finished
reading
it
*NL*
there
,
with
his
back
towards
me
,
and
after
he
had
finished
and
had
*NL*
folded
it
up
,
stood
there
for
some
minutes
with
the
letter
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
When
he
came
back
to
his
chair
,
I
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
Esther
,
you
know
what
she
says
here
?
''
He
spoke
in
a
*NL*
softened
voice
and
kissed
the
letter
as
he
asked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Richard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Offers
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
tapping
his
foot
upon
the
floor
,
``
the
little
*NL*
inheritance
she
is
certain
of
so
soon
--
just
as
little
and
as
much
as
*NL*
I
have
wasted
--
and
begs
and
prays
me
to
take
it
,
set
myself
right
*NL*
with
it
,
and
remain
in
the
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
welfare
to
be
the
dearest
wish
of
her
heart
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
``
And
,
oh
,
my
dear
Richard
,
Ada
's
is
a
noble
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
it
is
.
I
--
I
wish
I
was
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
window
,
and
laying
his
arm
across
it
,
leaned
his
*NL*
head
down
on
his
arm
.
It
greatly
affected
me
to
see
him
so
,
but
I
*NL*
hoped
he
might
become
more
yielding
,
and
I
remained
silent
.
My
*NL*
experience
was
very
limited
;
I
was
not
at
all
prepared
for
his
*NL*
rousing
himself
out
of
this
emotion
to
a
new
sense
of
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
the
heart
that
the
same
John
Jarndyce
,
who
is
not
*NL*
otherwise
to
be
mentioned
between
us
,
stepped
in
to
estrange
from
*NL*
me
,
''
said
he
indignantly
.
``
And
the
dear
girl
makes
me
this
generous
*NL*
offer
from
under
the
same
John
Jarndyce
's
roof
,
and
with
the
same
*NL*
John
Jarndyce
's
gracious
consent
and
connivance
,
I
dare
say
,
as
a
new
*NL*
means
of
buying
me
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
!
''
I
cried
out
,
rising
hastily
.
``
I
will
not
hear
you
say
such
*NL*
shameful
words
!
''
I
was
very
angry
with
him
indeed
,
for
the
first
time
*NL*
in
my
life
,
but
it
only
lasted
a
moment
.
When
I
saw
his
worn
young
*NL*
face
looking
at
me
as
if
he
were
sorry
,
I
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
*NL*
and
said
,
``
If
you
please
,
my
dear
Richard
,
do
not
speak
in
such
a
*NL*
tone
to
me
.
Consider
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
blamed
himself
exceedingly
and
told
me
in
the
most
generous
manner
*NL*
that
he
had
been
very
wrong
and
that
he
begged
my
pardon
a
thousand
*NL*
times
.
At
that
I
laughed
,
but
trembled
a
little
too
,
for
I
was
rather
*NL*
fluttered
after
being
so
fiery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
accept
this
offer
,
my
dear
Esther
,
''
said
he
,
sitting
down
beside
*NL*
me
and
resuming
our
conversation
,
''
--
once
more
,
pray
,
pray
forgive
*NL*
me
;
I
am
deeply
grieved
--
to
accept
my
dearest
cousin
's
offer
is
,
I
*NL*
need
not
say
,
impossible
.
Besides
,
I
have
letters
and
papers
that
I
*NL*
could
show
you
which
would
convince
you
it
is
all
over
here
.
I
have
*NL*
done
with
the
red
coat
,
believe
me
.
But
it
is
some
satisfaction
,
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
my
troubles
and
perplexities
,
to
know
that
I
am
pressing
*NL*
Ada
's
interests
in
pressing
my
own
.
Vholes
has
his
shoulder
to
the
*NL*
wheel
,
and
he
can
not
help
urging
it
on
as
much
for
her
as
for
me
,
*NL*
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sanguine
hopes
were
rising
within
him
and
lighting
up
his
*NL*
features
,
but
they
made
his
face
more
sad
to
me
than
it
had
been
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
cried
Richard
exultingly
.
``
If
every
farthing
of
Ada
's
*NL*
little
fortune
were
mine
,
no
part
of
it
should
be
spent
in
retaining
*NL*
me
in
what
I
am
not
fit
for
,
can
take
no
interest
in
,
and
am
weary
*NL*
of
.
It
should
be
devoted
to
what
promises
a
better
return
,
and
should
*NL*
be
used
where
she
has
a
larger
stake
.
Do
n't
be
uneasy
for
me
!
I
shall
*NL*
now
have
only
one
thing
on
my
mind
,
and
Vholes
and
I
will
work
it
.
I
*NL*
shall
not
be
without
means
.
Free
of
my
commission
,
I
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
compound
with
some
small
usurers
who
will
hear
of
nothing
but
their
*NL*
bond
now
--
Vholes
says
so
.
I
should
have
a
balance
in
my
favour
*NL*
anyway
,
but
that
would
swell
it
.
Come
,
come
!
You
shall
carry
a
letter
*NL*
to
Ada
from
me
,
Esther
,
and
you
must
both
of
you
be
more
hopeful
of
*NL*
me
and
not
believe
that
I
am
quite
cast
away
just
yet
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
repeat
what
I
said
to
Richard
.
I
know
it
was
tiresome
,
and
*NL*
nobody
is
to
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
was
at
all
wise
.
It
only
*NL*
came
from
my
heart
.
He
heard
it
patiently
and
feelingly
,
but
I
saw
*NL*
that
on
the
two
subjects
he
had
reserved
it
was
at
present
hopeless
*NL*
to
make
any
representation
to
him
.
I
saw
too
,
and
had
experienced
in
*NL*
this
very
interview
,
the
sense
of
my
guardian
's
remark
that
it
was
*NL*
even
more
mischievous
to
use
persuasion
with
him
than
to
leave
him
as
*NL*
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
I
was
driven
at
last
to
asking
Richard
if
he
would
mind
*NL*
convincing
me
that
it
really
was
all
over
there
,
as
he
had
said
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
not
his
mere
impression
.
He
showed
me
without
hesitation
*NL*
a
correspondence
making
it
quite
plain
that
his
retirement
was
*NL*
arranged
.
I
found
,
from
what
he
told
me
,
that
Mr.
Vholes
had
copies
*NL*
of
these
papers
and
had
been
in
consultation
with
him
throughout
.
*NL*
Beyond
ascertaining
this
,
and
having
been
the
bearer
of
Ada
's
letter
,
*NL*
and
being
-LRB-
as
I
was
going
to
be
-RRB-
Richard
's
companion
back
to
London
,
*NL*
I
had
done
no
good
by
coming
down
.
Admitting
this
to
myself
with
a
*NL*
reluctant
heart
,
I
said
I
would
return
to
the
hotel
and
wait
until
he
*NL*
joined
me
there
,
so
he
threw
a
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
saw
me
to
*NL*
the
gate
,
and
Charley
and
I
went
back
along
the
beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
concourse
of
people
in
one
spot
,
surrounding
some
naval
*NL*
officers
who
were
landing
from
a
boat
,
and
pressing
about
them
with
*NL*
unusual
interest
.
I
said
to
Charley
this
would
be
one
of
the
great
*NL*
Indiaman
's
boats
now
,
and
we
stopped
to
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
came
slowly
up
from
the
waterside
,
speaking
*NL*
good-humouredly
to
each
other
and
to
the
people
around
and
glancing
*NL*
about
them
as
if
they
were
glad
to
be
in
England
again
.
``
Charley
,
*NL*
Charley
,
''
said
I
,
``
come
away
!
''
And
I
hurried
on
so
swiftly
that
my
*NL*
little
maid
was
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
we
were
shut
up
in
our
cabin-room
and
I
had
had
time
*NL*
to
take
breath
that
I
began
to
think
why
I
had
made
such
haste
.
In
*NL*
one
of
the
sunburnt
faces
I
had
recognized
Mr.
Allan
Woodcourt
,
and
I
*NL*
had
been
afraid
of
his
recognizing
me
.
I
had
been
unwilling
that
he
*NL*
should
see
my
altered
looks
.
I
had
been
taken
by
surprise
,
and
my
*NL*
courage
had
quite
failed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
knew
this
would
not
do
,
and
I
now
said
to
myself
,
``
My
dear
,
*NL*
there
is
no
reason
--
there
is
and
there
can
be
no
reason
at
all
--
why
*NL*
it
should
be
worse
for
you
now
than
it
ever
has
been
.
What
you
were
*NL*
last
month
,
you
are
to-day
;
you
are
no
worse
,
you
are
no
better
.
This
*NL*
is
not
your
resolution
;
call
it
up
,
Esther
,
call
it
up
!
''
I
was
in
a
*NL*
great
tremble
--
with
running
--
and
at
first
was
quite
unable
to
calm
*NL*
myself
;
but
I
got
better
,
and
I
was
very
glad
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
came
to
the
hotel
.
I
heard
them
speaking
on
the
staircase
.
*NL*
I
was
sure
it
was
the
same
gentlemen
because
I
knew
their
voices
*NL*
again
--
I
mean
I
knew
Mr.
Woodcourt
's
.
It
would
still
have
been
a
*NL*
great
relief
to
me
to
have
gone
away
without
making
myself
known
,
but
*NL*
I
was
determined
not
to
do
so
.
``
No
,
my
dear
,
no
.
No
,
no
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
untied
my
bonnet
and
put
my
veil
half
up
--
I
think
I
mean
half
down
,
*NL*
but
it
matters
very
little
--
and
wrote
on
one
of
my
cards
that
I
*NL*
happened
to
be
there
with
Mr.
Richard
Carstone
,
and
I
sent
it
in
to
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
He
came
immediately
.
I
told
him
I
was
rejoiced
to
be
*NL*
by
chance
among
the
first
to
welcome
him
home
to
England
.
And
I
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
very
sorry
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
in
shipwreck
and
peril
since
you
left
us
,
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
we
can
hardly
call
that
a
misfortune
which
*NL*
enabled
you
to
be
so
useful
and
so
brave
.
We
read
of
it
with
the
*NL*
truest
interest
.
It
first
came
to
my
knowledge
through
your
old
*NL*
patient
,
poor
Miss
Flite
,
when
I
was
recovering
from
my
severe
*NL*
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Little
Miss
Flite
!
''
he
said
.
``
She
lives
the
same
life
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
comfortable
with
myself
now
as
not
to
mind
the
veil
and
to
*NL*
be
able
to
put
it
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
gratitude
to
you
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
is
delightful
.
She
is
a
most
*NL*
affectionate
creature
,
as
I
have
reason
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
you
have
found
her
so
?
''
he
returned
.
``
I
--
I
am
glad
of
that
.
''
He
*NL*
was
so
very
sorry
for
me
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
was
deeply
touched
by
her
sympathy
*NL*
and
pleasure
at
the
time
I
have
referred
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
grieved
to
hear
that
you
had
been
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
quite
recovered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
quite
recovered
my
health
and
my
cheerfulness
,
''
said
I.
``
You
*NL*
know
how
good
my
guardian
is
and
what
a
happy
life
we
lead
,
and
I
*NL*
have
everything
to
be
thankful
for
and
nothing
in
the
world
to
*NL*
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
as
if
he
had
greater
commiseration
for
me
than
I
had
ever
had
*NL*
for
myself
.
It
inspired
me
with
new
fortitude
and
new
calmness
to
*NL*
find
that
it
was
I
who
was
under
the
necessity
of
reassuring
him
.
I
*NL*
spoke
to
him
of
his
voyage
out
and
home
,
and
of
his
future
plans
,
and
*NL*
of
his
probable
return
to
India
.
He
said
that
was
very
doubtful
.
He
*NL*
had
not
found
himself
more
favoured
by
fortune
there
than
here
.
He
*NL*
had
gone
out
a
poor
ship
's
surgeon
and
had
come
home
nothing
better
.
*NL*
While
we
were
talking
,
and
when
I
was
glad
to
believe
that
I
had
*NL*
alleviated
-LRB-
if
I
may
use
such
a
term
-RRB-
the
shock
he
had
had
in
seeing
*NL*
me
,
Richard
came
in
.
He
had
heard
downstairs
who
was
with
me
,
and
*NL*
they
met
with
cordial
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
that
after
their
first
greetings
were
over
,
and
when
they
spoke
*NL*
of
Richard
's
career
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
had
a
perception
that
all
was
not
*NL*
going
well
with
him
.
He
frequently
glanced
at
his
face
as
if
there
*NL*
were
something
in
it
that
gave
him
pain
,
and
more
than
once
he
looked
*NL*
towards
me
as
though
he
sought
to
ascertain
whether
I
knew
what
the
*NL*
truth
was
.
Yet
Richard
was
in
one
of
his
sanguine
states
and
in
good
*NL*
spirits
and
was
thoroughly
pleased
to
see
Mr.
Woodcourt
again
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
always
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
proposed
that
we
all
should
go
to
London
together
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
,
having
to
remain
by
his
ship
a
little
longer
,
could
not
*NL*
join
us
.
He
dined
with
us
,
however
,
at
an
early
hour
,
and
became
so
*NL*
much
more
like
what
he
used
to
be
that
I
was
still
more
at
peace
to
*NL*
think
I
had
been
able
to
soften
his
regrets
.
Yet
his
mind
was
not
*NL*
relieved
of
Richard
.
When
the
coach
was
almost
ready
and
Richard
ran
*NL*
down
to
look
after
his
luggage
,
he
spoke
to
me
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
sure
that
I
had
a
right
to
lay
his
whole
story
open
,
but
I
*NL*
referred
in
a
few
words
to
his
estrangement
from
Mr
Jarndyce
and
to
*NL*
his
being
entangled
in
the
ill-fated
Chancery
suit
.
Mr.
Woodcourt
*NL*
listened
with
interest
and
expressed
his
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
observe
him
rather
closely
,
''
said
I
,
``
Do
you
think
him
so
*NL*
changed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
changed
,
''
he
returned
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
blood
rush
into
my
face
for
the
first
time
,
but
it
was
*NL*
only
an
instantaneous
emotion
.
I
turned
my
head
aside
,
and
it
was
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
,
''
said
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
``
his
being
so
much
younger
or
older
,
*NL*
or
thinner
or
fatter
,
or
paler
or
ruddier
,
as
there
being
upon
his
*NL*
face
such
a
singular
expression
.
I
never
saw
so
remarkable
a
look
in
*NL*
a
young
person
.
One
can
not
say
that
it
is
all
anxiety
or
all
*NL*
weariness
;
yet
it
is
both
,
and
like
ungrown
despair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
think
he
is
ill
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
He
looked
robust
in
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
can
not
be
at
peace
in
mind
,
we
have
too
much
reason
to
*NL*
know
,
''
I
proceeded
.
``
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
you
are
going
to
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
or
the
next
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
Richard
wants
so
much
as
a
friend
.
He
always
liked
*NL*
you
.
Pray
see
him
when
you
get
there
.
Pray
help
him
sometimes
with
*NL*
your
companionship
if
you
can
.
You
do
not
know
of
what
service
it
*NL*
might
be
.
You
can
not
think
how
Ada
,
and
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
and
even
I
--
how
*NL*
we
should
all
thank
you
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
said
,
more
moved
than
he
had
been
from
the
*NL*
first
,
``
before
heaven
,
I
will
be
a
true
friend
to
him
!
I
will
accept
*NL*
him
as
a
trust

and
it
shall
be
a
sacred
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
!
''
said
I
,
with
my
eyes
filling
fast
;
but
I
thought
*NL*
they
might
,
when
it
was
not
for
myself
.
``
Ada
loves
him
--
we
all
love
*NL*
him
,
but
Ada
loves
him
as
we
can
not
.
I
will
tell
her
what
you
say
.
*NL*
Thank
you
,
and
God
bless
you
,
in
her
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
came
back
as
we
finished
exchanging
these
hurried
words
and
*NL*
gave
me
his
arm
to
take
me
to
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woodcourt
,
''
he
said
,
unconscious
with
what
application
,
``
pray
let
us
*NL*
meet
in
London
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meet
?
''
returned
the
other
.
``
I
have
scarcely
a
friend
there
now
but
*NL*
you
.
Where
shall
I
find
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
must
get
a
lodging
of
some
sort
,
''
said
Richard
,
pondering
.
*NL*
``
Say
at
Vholes
's
,
Symond
's
Inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
Without
loss
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
heartily
.
When
I
was
seated
in
the
coach
and
Richard
*NL*
was
yet
standing
in
the
street
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
laid
his
friendly
hand
*NL*
on
Richard
's
shoulder
and
looked
at
me
.
I
understood
him
and
waved
*NL*
mine
in
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
his
last
look
as
we
drove
away
,
I
saw
that
he
was
very
sorry
*NL*
for
me
.
I
was
glad
to
see
it
.
I
felt
for
my
old
self
as
the
dead
may
*NL*
feel
if
they
ever
revisit
these
scenes
.
I
was
glad
to
be
tenderly
*NL*
remembered
,
to
be
gently
pitied
,
not
to
be
quite
forgotten

CHAPTER
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
Stop
Him
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Darkness
rests
upon
Tom-All-Alone
's
.
Dilating
and
dilating
since
the
*NL*
sun
went
down
last
night
,
it
has
gradually
swelled
until
it
fills
*NL*
every
void
in
the
place
.
For
a
time
there
were
some
dungeon
lights
*NL*
burning
,
as
the
lamp
of
life
hums
in
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
heavily
,
*NL*
heavily
,
in
the
nauseous
air
,
and
winking
--
as
that
lamp
,
too
,
winks
*NL*
in
Tom-all-Alone
's
--
at
many
horrible
things
.
But
they
are
blotted
*NL*
out
.
The
moon
has
eyed
Tom
with
a
dull
cold
stare
,
as
admitting
some
*NL*
puny
emulation
of
herself
in
his
desert
region
unfit
for
life
and
*NL*
blasted
by
volcanic
fires
;
but
she
has
passed
on
and
is
gone
.
The
*NL*
blackest
nightmare
in
the
infernal
stables
grazes
on
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
*NL*
and
Tom
is
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
mighty
speech-making
there
has
been
,
both
in
and
out
of
*NL*
Parliament
,
concerning
Tom
,
and
much
wrathful
disputation
how
Tom
*NL*
shall
be
got
right
.
Whether
he
shall
be
put
into
the
main
road
by
*NL*
constables
,
or
by
beadles
,
or
by
bell-ringing
,
or
by
force
of
*NL*
figures
,
or
by
correct
principles
of
taste
,
or
by
high
church
,
or
by
*NL*
low
church
,
or
by
no
church
;
whether
he
shall
be
set
to
splitting
*NL*
trusses
of
polemical
straws
with
the
crooked
knife
of
his
mind
or
*NL*
whether
he
shall
be
put
to
stone-breaking
instead
.
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
which
dust
and
noise
there
is
but
one
thing
perfectly
clear
,
to
wit
,
*NL*
that
Tom
only
may
and
can
,
or
shall
and
will
,
be
reclaimed
according
*NL*
to
somebody
's
theory
but
nobody
's
practice
.
And
in
the
hopeful
*NL*
meantime
,
Tom
goes
to
perdition
head
foremost
in
his
old
determined
*NL*
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
has
his
revenge
.
Even
the
winds
are
his
messengers
,
and
they
*NL*
serve
him
in
these
hours
of
darkness
.
There
is
not
a
drop
of
Tom
's
*NL*
corrupted
blood
but
propagates
infection
and
contagion
somewhere
.
It
*NL*
shall
pollute
,
this
very
night
,
the
choice
stream
-LRB-
in
which
chemists
*NL*
on
analysis
would
find
the
genuine
nobility
-RRB-
of
a
Norman
house
,
and
*NL*
his
Grace
shall
not
be
able
to
say
nay
to
the
infamous
alliance
.
*NL*
There
is
not
an
atom
of
Tom
's
slime
,
not
a
cubic
inch
of
any
*NL*
pestilential
gas
in
which
he
lives
,
not
one
obscenity
or
degradation
*NL*
about
him
,
not
an
ignorance
,
not
a
wickedness
,
not
a
brutality
of
his
*NL*
committing
,
but
shall
work
its
retribution
through
every
order
of
*NL*
society
up
to
the
proudest
of
the
proud
and
to
the
highest
of
the
*NL*
high
.
Verily
,
what
with
tainting
,
plundering
,
and
spoiling
,
Tom
has
*NL*
his
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
moot
point
whether
Tom-all-Alone
's
be
uglier
by
day
or
by
*NL*
night
,
but
on
the
argument
that
the
more
that
is
seen
of
it
the
more
*NL*
shocking
it
must
be
,
and
that
no
part
of
it
left
to
the
imagination
*NL*
is
at
all
likely
to
be
made
so
bad
as
the
reality
,
day
carries
it
.
*NL*
The
day
begins
to
break
now
;
and
in
truth
it
might
be
better
for
the
*NL*
national
glory
even
that
the
sun
should
sometimes
set
upon
the
*NL*
British
dominions
than
that
it
should
ever
rise
upon
so
vile
a
wonder
*NL*
as
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
brown
sunburnt
gentleman
,
who
appears
in
some
inaptitude
for
sleep
*NL*
to
be
wandering
abroad
rather
than
counting
the
hours
on
a
restless
*NL*
pillow
,
strolls
hitherward
at
this
quiet
time
.
Attracted
by
*NL*
curiosity
,
he
often
pauses
and
looks
about
him
,
up
and
down
the
*NL*
miserable
by-ways
.
Nor
is
he
merely
curious
,
for
in
his
bright
dark
*NL*
eye
there
is
compassionate
interest
;
and
as
he
looks
here
and
there
,
*NL*
he
seems
to
understand
such
wretchedness
and
to
have
studied
it
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
banks
of
the
stagnant
channel
of
mud
which
is
the
main
street
*NL*
of
Tom-all-Alone
's
,
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
the
crazy
houses
,
shut
*NL*
up
and
silent
.
No
waking
creature
save
himself
appears
except
in
one
*NL*
direction
,
where
he
sees
the
solitary
figure
of
a
woman
sitting
on
a
*NL*
door-step
.
He
walks
that
way
.
Approaching
,
he
observes
that
she
has
*NL*
journeyed
a
long
distance
and
is
footsore
and
travel-stained
.
She
*NL*
sits
on
the
door-step
in
the
manner
of
one
who
is
waiting
,
with
her
*NL*
elbow
on
her
knee
and
her
head
upon
her
hand
.
Beside
her
is
a
canvas
*NL*
bag
,
or
bundle
,
she
has
carried
.
She
is
dozing
probably
,
for
she
*NL*
gives
no
heed
to
his
steps
as
he
comes
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
broken
footway
is
so
narrow
that
when
Allan
Woodcourt
comes
to
*NL*
where
the
woman
sits
,
he
has
to
turn
into
the
road
to
pass
her
.
*NL*
Looking
down
at
her
face
,
his
eye
meets
hers
,
and
he
stops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
make
them
hear
?
Do
you
want
to
be
let
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
waiting
till
they
get
up
at
another
house
--
a
lodging-house
--
not
*NL*
here
,
''
the
woman
patiently
returns
.
``
I
'm
waiting
here
because
there
*NL*
will
be
sun
here
presently
to
warm
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
are
tired
.
I
am
sorry
to
see
you
sitting
in
the
*NL*
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
It
do
n't
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
habit
in
him
of
speaking
to
the
poor
and
of
avoiding
patronage
or
*NL*
condescension
or
childishness
-LRB-
which
is
the
favourite
device
,
many
*NL*
people
deeming
it
quite
a
subtlety
to
talk
to
them
like
little
*NL*
spelling
books
-RRB-
has
put
him
on
good
terms
with
the
woman
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
look
at
your
forehead
,
''
he
says
,
bending
down
.
``
I
am
a
*NL*
doctor
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
I
would
n't
hurt
you
for
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knows
that
by
touching
her
with
his
skilful
and
accustomed
hand
he
*NL*
can
soothe
her
yet
more
readily
.
She
makes
a
slight
objection
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
It
's
nothing
''
;
but
he
has
scarcely
laid
his
fingers
on
the
*NL*
wounded
place
when
she
lifts
it
up
to
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
A
bad
bruise
,
and
the
skin
sadly
broken
.
This
must
be
very
*NL*
sore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
do
ache
a
little
,
sir
,
''
returns
the
woman
with
a
started
tear
*NL*
upon
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
try
to
make
it
more
comfortable
.
My
handkerchief
wo
n't
hurt
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
no
,
sir
,
I
'm
sure
of
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cleanses
the
injured
place
and
dries
it
,
and
having
carefully
*NL*
examined
it
and
gently
pressed
it
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
takes
a
*NL*
small
case
from
his
pocket
,
dresses
it
,
and
binds
it
up
.
While
he
is
*NL*
thus
employed
,
he
says
,
after
laughing
at
his
establishing
a
surgery
*NL*
in
the
street
,
``
And
so
your
husband
is
a
brickmaker
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
,
sir
?
''
asks
the
woman
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
suppose
so
from
the
colour
of
the
clay
upon
your
bag
and
on
*NL*
your
dress
.
And
I
know
brickmakers
go
about
working
at
piecework
in
*NL*
different
places
.
And
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
have
known
them
cruel
to
*NL*
their
wives
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
hastily
lifts
up
her
eyes
as
if
she
would
deny
that
her
*NL*
injury
is
referable
to
such
a
cause
.
But
feeling
the
hand
upon
her
*NL*
forehead
,
and
seeing
his
busy
and
composed
face
,
she
quietly
drops
*NL*
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
now
?
''
asks
the
surgeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
got
into
trouble
last
night
,
sir
;
but
he
'll
look
for
me
at
the
*NL*
lodging-house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
get
into
worse
trouble
if
he
often
misuses
his
large
and
*NL*
heavy
hand
as
he
has
misused
it
here
.
But
you
forgive
him
,
brutal
as
*NL*
he
is
,
and
I
say
no
more
of
him
,
except
that
I
wish
he
deserved
it
.
*NL*
You
have
no
young
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
shakes
her
head
.
``
One
as
I
calls
mine
,
sir
,
but
it
's
*NL*
Liz
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
own
is
dead
.
I
see
!
Poor
little
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
he
has
finished
and
is
putting
up
his
case
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
you
have
some
settled
home
.
Is
it
far
from
here
?
''
he
asks
,
*NL*
good-humouredly
making
light
of
what
he
has
done
as
she
gets
up
and
*NL*
curtsys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
two
or
three
and
twenty
mile
from
here
,
sir
.
At
Saint
*NL*
Albans
.
You
know
Saint
Albans
,
sir
?
I
thought
you
gave
a
start
like
,
*NL*
as
if
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
something
of
it
.
And
now
I
will
ask
you
a
question
in
*NL*
return
.
Have
you
money
for
your
lodging
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
she
says
,
``
really
and
truly
.
''
And
she
shows
it
.
He
tells
*NL*
her
,
in
acknowledgment
of
her
many
subdued
thanks
,
that
she
is
very
*NL*
welcome
,
gives
her
good
day
,
and
walks
away
.
Tom-all-Alone
's
is
still
*NL*
asleep
,
and
nothing
is
astir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
something
is
!
As
he
retraces
his
way
to
the
point
from
which
he
*NL*
descried
the
woman
at
a
distance
sitting
on
the
step
,
he
sees
a
*NL*
ragged
figure
coming
very
cautiously
along
,
crouching
close
to
the
*NL*
soiled
walls
--
which
the
wretchedest
figure
might
as
well
avoid
--
and
*NL*
furtively
thrusting
a
hand
before
it
.
It
is
the
figure
of
a
youth
*NL*
whose
face
is
hollow
and
whose
eyes
have
an
emaciated
glare
.
He
is
so
*NL*
intent
on
getting
along
unseen
that
even
the
apparition
of
a
stranger
*NL*
in
whole
garments
does
not
tempt
him
to
look
back
.
He
shades
his
face
*NL*
with
his
ragged
elbow
as
he
passes
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
and
*NL*
goes
shrinking
and
creeping
on
with
his
anxious
hand
before
him
and
*NL*
his
shapeless
clothes
hanging
in
shreds
.
Clothes
made
for
what
*NL*
purpose
,
or
of
what
material
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
.
They
*NL*
look
,
in
colour
and
in
substance
,
like
a
bundle
of
rank
leaves
of
*NL*
swampy
growth
that
rotted
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
Woodcourt
pauses
to
look
after
him
and
note
all
this
,
with
a
*NL*
shadowy
belief
that
he
has
seen
the
boy
before
.
He
can
not
recall
how
*NL*
or
where
,
but
there
is
some
association
in
his
mind
with
such
a
form
.
*NL*
He
imagines
that
he
must
have
seen
it
in
some
hospital
or
refuge
,
*NL*
still
,
can
not
make
out
why
it
comes
with
any
special
force
on
his
*NL*
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
gradually
emerging
from
Tom-all-Alone
's
in
the
morning
light
,
*NL*
thinking
about
it
,
when
he
hears
running
feet
behind
him
,
and
looking
*NL*
round
,
sees
the
boy
scouring
towards
him
at
great
speed
,
followed
by
*NL*
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
him
,
stop
him
!
''
cries
the
woman
,
almost
breathless
.
``
Stop
him
,
*NL*
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
darts
across
the
road
into
the
boy
's
path
,
but
the
boy
is
quicker
*NL*
than
he
,
makes
a
curve
,
ducks
,
dives
under
his
hands
,
comes
up
*NL*
half-a-dozen
yards
beyond
him
,
and
scours
away
again
.
Still
the
woman
*NL*
follows
,
crying
,
``
Stop
him
,
sir
,
pray
stop
him
!
''
Allan
,
not
knowing
*NL*
but
that
he
has
just
robbed
her
of
her
money
,
follows
in
chase
and
*NL*
runs
so
hard
that
he
runs
the
boy
down
a
dozen
times
,
but
each
time
*NL*
he
repeats
the
curve
,
the
duck
,
the
dive
,
and
scours
away
again
.
To
*NL*
strike
at
him
on
any
of
these
occasions
would
be
to
fell
and
disable
*NL*
him
,
but
the
pursuer
can
not
resolve
to
do
that
,
and
so
the
grimly
*NL*
ridiculous
pursuit
continues
.
At
last
the
fugitive
,
hard-pressed
,
*NL*
takes
to
a
narrow
passage
and
a
court
which
has
no
thoroughfare
.
*NL*
Here
,
against
a
hoarding
of
decaying
timber
,
he
is
brought
to
bay
and
*NL*
tumbles
down
,
lying
gasping
at
his
pursuer
,
who
stands
and
gasps
at
*NL*
him
until
the
woman
comes
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
,
Jo
!
''
cries
the
woman
.
``
What
?
I
have
found
you
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
''
repeats
Allan
,
looking
at
him
with
attention
,
``
Jo
!
Stay
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
!
I
recollect
this
lad
some
time
ago
being
brought
before
the
*NL*
coroner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Jo

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
it
with
such
a
pitiable
air
,
and
his
grimy
tears
appear
so
*NL*
real
,
and
he
lies
in
the
corner
up
against
the
hoarding
so
like
a
*NL*
growth
of
fungus
or
any
unwholesome
excrescence
produced
there
in
*NL*
neglect
and
impurity
,
that
Allan
Woodcourt
is
softened
towards
him
.
*NL*
He
says
to
the
woman
,
``
Miserable
creature
,
what
has
he
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
she
only
replies
,
shaking
her
head
at
the
prostrate
figure
*NL*
more
amazedly
than
angrily
,
``
Oh

He

''
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
looks
from
Jo
to
the
woman
,
and
from
the
woman
to
Jo
,
waiting
*NL*
for
one
of
them
to
unravel
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

ran

never

on
him
just
now
.
And
that
young
lady
*NL*
that
was
such
a
pretty
dear
caught
his
illness
,
lost
her
beautiful
*NL*
looks
,
and
would
n't
hardly
be
known
for
the
same
young
lady
now
if
it
*NL*
was
n't
for
her
angel
temper
,
and
her
pretty
shape
,
and
her
sweet
*NL*
voice
.
Do
you
know
it
?
You
ungrateful
wretch
,
do
you
know
that
this
*NL*
is
all
along
of
you
and
of
her
goodness
to
you
?
''
demands
the
woman
,
*NL*
beginning
to
rage
at
him
as
she
recalls
it
and
breaking
into
*NL*
passionate
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
,
in
rough
sort
stunned
by
what
he
hears
,
falls
to
smearing
*NL*
his
dirty
forehead
with
his
dirty
palm
,
and
to
staring
at
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
to
shaking
from
head
to
foot
until
the
crazy
hoarding
against
*NL*
which
he
leans
rattles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
restrains
the
woman
,
merely
by
a
quiet
gesture
,
but
*NL*
effectually
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
told
me
--
''
He
falters
.
``
I
mean
,
I
have
heard
of
this
--
do
n't
*NL*
mind
me
for
a
moment
,
I
will
speak
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turns
away
and
stands
for
a
while
looking
out
at
the
covered
*NL*
passage
.
When
he
comes
back
,
he
has
recovered
his
composure
,
except
*NL*
that
he
contends
against
an
avoidance
of
the
boy
,
which
is
so
very
*NL*
remarkable
that
it
absorbs
the
woman
's
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
what
she
says
.
But
get
up
,
get
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
,
shaking
and
chattering
,
slowly
rises
and
stands
,
after
the
manner
*NL*
of
his
tribe
in
a
difficulty
,
sideways
against
the
hoarding
,
resting
*NL*
one
of
his
high
shoulders
against
it
and
covertly
rubbing
his
right
*NL*
hand
over
his
left
and
his
left
foot
over
his
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
what
she
says
,
and
I
know
it
's
true
.
Have
you
been
here
*NL*
ever
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wishermaydie
if
I
seen
Tom-all-Alone
's
till
this
blessed
morning
,
''
*NL*
replies
Jo
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
come
here
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
looks
all
round
the
confined
court
,
looks
at
his
questioner
no
*NL*
higher
than
the
knees
,
and
finally
answers
,
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
do
*NL*
nothink
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
nothink
to
do
.
I
'm
wery
poor
and
ill
,
and
I
*NL*
thought
I
'd
come
back
here
when
there
war
n't
nobody
about
,
and
lay
*NL*
down
and
hide
somewheres
as
I
knows
on
till
arter
dark
,
and
then
go
*NL*
and
beg
a
trifle
of
Mr.
Snagsby
.
He
wos
allus
willin
fur
to
give
me
*NL*
somethink

,
though
Mrs.
Snagsby
she
was
allus
a-chivying
on
*NL*
me
--
like
everybody
everywheres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
looks
all
round
the
court
again
,
looks
at
his
questioner
's
knees
*NL*
again
,
and
concludes
by
laying
his
profile
against
the
hoarding
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
me
ask
you
where
you
have
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tramp
then
,
''
says
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
tell
me
,
''
proceeds
Allan
,
making
a
strong
effort
to
overcome
his
*NL*
repugnance
,
going
very
near
to
him
,
and
leaning
over
him
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
confidence
,
``
tell
me
how
it
came
about
that
you
left
*NL*
that
house
when
the
good
young
lady
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
*NL*
pity
you
and
take
you
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
suddenly
comes
out
of
his
resignation
and
excitedly
declares
,
*NL*
addressing
the
woman
,
that
he
never
known
about
the
young
lady
,
that
*NL*
he
never
heern
about
it
,
that
he
never
went
fur
to
hurt
her
,
that
he
*NL*
would
sooner
have
hurt
his
own
self
,
that
he
'd
sooner
have
had
his
*NL*
unfortnet
ed
chopped
off
than
ever
gone
a-nigh
her
,
and
that
she
wos
*NL*
wery
good
to
him
,
she
wos
.
Conducting
himself
throughout
as
if
in
his
*NL*
poor
fashion
he
really
meant
it
,
and
winding
up
with
some
very
*NL*
miserable
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
Woodcourt
sees
that
this
is
not
a
sham
.
He
constrains
himself
*NL*
to
touch
him
.
``
Come
,
Jo
.
Tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
dust
n't
,
''
says
Jo
,
relapsing
into
the
profile
state
.
``
I
*NL*
dust
n't
,
or
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
know
,
''
returns
the
other
,
``
all
the
same
.
Come
,
Jo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
or
three
such
adjurations
,
Jo
lifts
up
his
head
again
,
*NL*
looks
round
the
court
again
,
and
says
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Well
,
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
something
.
I
was
took
away
.
There
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Took
away
?
In
the
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
Very
apprehensive
of
being
overheard
,
Jo
looks
about
him
and
*NL*
even
glances
up
some
ten
feet
at
the
top
of
the
hoarding
and
through
*NL*
the
cracks
in
it
lest
the
object
of
his
distrust
should
be
looking
*NL*
over
or
hidden
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
took
you
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dust
n't
name
him
,
''
says
Jo
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want

hear

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
do
n't

replies
Jo
,
shaking
his
head
fearfully
,
``

*NL*
he
DO
N'T

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

he
is
not
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
says
Jo
.
``
He
's
in

all

''
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
looks
at
him
in
perplexity
,
but
discovers
some
real
meaning
and
*NL*
good
faith
at
the
bottom
of
this
bewildering
reply
.
He
patiently
*NL*
awaits
an
explicit
answer
;
and
Jo
,
more
baffled
by
his
patience
than
*NL*
by
anything
else
,
at
last
desperately
whispers
a
name
in
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
''
says
Allan
.
``
Why
,
what
had
you
been
doing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothink

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Put

in

replied
Jo
,
whispering
,
``

was

concludes
Jo
,
nervously
repeating
all
his
*NL*
former
precautions
and
investigations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
considers
a
little
,
then
remarks
,
turning
to
the
woman
but
*NL*
keeping
an
encouraging
eye
on
Jo
,
``
He

``

nods
and
shambles
and

shivers
,
and
smears
and
blinks

and
half
laughs

half
cries

a

farewell

takes
his
creeping
way
along
after

Woodcourt

close
to
the
houses
on

street

In

the
two
come
up
out

CHAPTER
XLVII
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
Will
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Allan
Woodcourt
and
Jo
proceed
along
the
streets
where
the
high
*NL*
church
spires
and
the
distances
are
so
near
and
clear
in
the
morning
*NL*
light
that
the
city
itself
seems
renewed
by
rest
,
Allan
revolves
in
*NL*
his
mind
how
and
where
he
shall
bestow
his
companion
.
``
It
surely
is
a
*NL*
strange
fact
,
''
he
considers
,
``
that
in
the
heart
of
a
civilized
world
*NL*
this
creature
in
human
form
should
be
more
difficult
to
dispose
of
*NL*
than
an
unowned
dog
.
''
But
it
is
none
the
less
a
fact
because
of
its
*NL*
strangeness
,
and
the
difficulty
remains
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
looks
behind
him
often
to
assure
himself
that
Jo
is
still
*NL*
really
following
.
But
look
where
he
will
,
he
still
beholds
him
close
*NL*
to
the
opposite
houses
,
making
his
way
with
his
wary
hand
from
brick
*NL*
to
brick
and
from
door
to
door
,
and
often
,
as
he
creeps
along
,
*NL*
glancing
over
at
him
watchfully
.
Soon
satisfied
that
the
last
thing
*NL*
in
his
thoughts
is
to
give
him
the
slip
,
Allan
goes
on
,
considering
*NL*
with
a
less
divided
attention
what
he
shall
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
breakfast-stall
at
a
street-corner
suggests
the
first
thing
to
be
*NL*
done
.
He
stops
there
,
looks
round
,
and
beckons
Jo
.
Jo
crosses
and
*NL*
comes
halting
and
shuffling
up
,
slowly
scooping
the
knuckles
of
his
*NL*
right
hand
round
and
round
in
the
hollowed
palm
of
his
left
,
kneading
*NL*
dirt
with
a
natural
pestle
and
mortar
.
What
is
a
dainty
repast
to
Jo
*NL*
is
then
set
before
him
,
and
he
begins
to
gulp
the
coffee
and
to
gnaw
*NL*
the
bread
and
butter
,
looking
anxiously
about
him
in
all
directions
*NL*
as
he
eats
and
drinks
,
like
a
scared
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
is
so
sick
and
miserable
that
even
hunger
has
abandoned
him
.
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
was
amost
a-starvin
,
sir
,
''
says
Jo
,
soon
putting
down
*NL*
his
food
,
``
but
I
do
n't
know
nothink
--
not
even
that
.
I
do
n't
care
for
*NL*
eating
wittles
nor
yet
for
drinking
on
'em
.
''
And
Jo
stands
shivering
*NL*
and
looking
at
the
breakfast
wonderingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
Woodcourt
lays
his
hand
upon
his
pulse
and
on
his
chest
.
``
Draw
*NL*
breath
,
Jo
!
''
``
It
draws
,
''
says
Jo
,
``
as
heavy
as
a
cart
.
''
He
might
add
,
*NL*
``
And
rattles
like
it
,
''
but
he
only
mutters
,
``
I
'm
a-moving
on
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
looks
about
for
an
apothecary
's
shop
.
There
is
none
at
hand
,
*NL*
but
a
tavern
does
as
well
or
better
.
He
obtains
a
little
measure
of
*NL*
wine
and
gives
the
lad
a
portion
of
it
very
carefully
.
He
begins
to
*NL*
revive
almost
as
soon
as
it
passes
his
lips
.
``
We
may
repeat
that
*NL*
dose
,
Jo
,
''
observes
Allan
after
watching
him
with
his
attentive
face
.
*NL*
``
So
!
Now
we
will
take
five
minutes
'
rest
,
and
then
go
on
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
boy
sitting
on
the
bench
of
the
breakfast-stall
,
with
his
*NL*
back
against
an
iron
railing
,
Allan
Woodcourt
paces
up
and
down
in
*NL*
the
early
sunshine
,
casting
an
occasional
look
towards
him
without
*NL*
appearing
to
watch
him
.
It
requires
no
discernment
to
perceive
that
*NL*
he
is
warmed
and
refreshed
.
If
a
face
so
shaded
can
brighten
,
his
*NL*
face
brightens
somewhat
;
and
by
little
and
little
he
eats
the
slice
*NL*
of
bread
he
had
so
hopelessly
laid
down
.
Observant
of
these
signs
of
*NL*
improvement
,
Allan
engages
him
in
conversation
and
elicits
to
his
no
*NL*
small
wonder
the
adventure
of
the
lady
in
the
veil
,
with
all
its
*NL*
consequences
.
Jo
slowly
munches
as
he
slowly
tells
it
.
When
he
has
*NL*
finished
his
story
and
his
bread
,
they
go
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Intending
to
refer
his
difficulty
in
finding
a
temporary
place
of
*NL*
refuge
for
the
boy
to
his
old
patient
,
zealous
little
Miss
Flite
,
*NL*
Allan
leads
the
way
to
the
court
where
he
and
Jo
first
foregathered
.
*NL*
But
all
is
changed
at
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
;
Miss
Flite
no
longer
*NL*
lodges
there
;
it
is
shut
up
;
and
a
hard-featured
female
,
much
*NL*
obscured
by
dust
,
whose
age
is
a
problem
,
but
who
is
indeed
no
other
*NL*
than
the
interesting
Judy
,
is
tart
and
spare
in
her
replies
.
These
*NL*
sufficing
,
however
,
to
inform
the
visitor
that
Miss
Flite
and
her
*NL*
birds
are
domiciled
with
a
Mrs.
Blinder
,
in
Bell
Yard
,
he
repairs
to
*NL*
that
neighbouring
place
,
where
Miss
Flite
-LRB-
who
rises
early
that
she
*NL*
may
be
punctual
at
the
divan
of
justice
held
by
her
excellent
friend
*NL*
the
Chancellor
-RRB-
comes
running
downstairs
with
tears
of
welcome
and
*NL*
with
open
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
physician
!
''
cries
Miss
Flite
.
``
My
meritorious
,
*NL*
distinguished
,
honourable
officer
!
''
She
uses
some
odd
expressions
,
*NL*
but
is
as
cordial
and
full
of
heart
as
sanity
itself
can
be
--
more
so
*NL*
than
it
often
is
.
Allan
,
very
patient
with
her
,
waits
until
she
has
*NL*
no
more
raptures
to
express
,
then
points
out
Jo
,
trembling
in
a
*NL*
doorway
,
and
tells
her
how
he
comes
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
can
I
lodge
him
hereabouts
for
the
present
?
Now
,
you
have
a
*NL*
fund
of
knowledge
and
good
sense
and
can
advise
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Flite
,
mighty
proud
of
the
compliment
,
sets
herself
to
consider
;
*NL*
but
it
is
long
before
a
bright
thought
occurs
to
her
.
Mrs.
Blinder
is
*NL*
entirely
let
,
and
she
herself
occupies
poor
Gridley
's
room
.
*NL*
``
Gridley
!
''
exclaims
Miss
Flite
,
clapping
her
hands
after
a
twentieth
*NL*
repetition
of
this
remark
.
``
Gridley
!
To
be
sure
!
Of
course
!
My
dear
*NL*
physician
!
General
George
will
help
us
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
hopeless
to
ask
for
any
information
about
General
George
,
and
*NL*
would
be
,
though
Miss
Flite
had
not
already
run
upstairs
to
put
on
*NL*
her
pinched
bonnet
and
her
poor
little
shawl
and
to
arm
herself
with
*NL*
her
reticule
of
documents
.
But
as
she
informs
her
physician
in
her
*NL*
disjointed
manner
on
coming
down
in
full
array
that
General
George
,
*NL*
whom
she
often
calls
upon
,
knows
her
dear
Fitz
Jarndyce
and
takes
a
*NL*
great
interest
in
all
connected
with
her
,
Allan
is
induced
to
think
*NL*
that
they
may
be
in
the
right
way
.
So
he
tells
Jo
,
for
his
*NL*
encouragement
,
that
this
walking
about
will
soon
be
over
now
;
and
*NL*
they
repair
to
the
general
's
.
Fortunately
it
is
not
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
exterior
of
George
's
Shooting
Gallery
,
and
the
long
entry
,
*NL*
and
the
bare
perspective
beyond
it
,
Allan
Woodcourt
augurs
well
.
He
*NL*
also
descries
promise
in
the
figure
of
Mr.
George
himself
,
striding
*NL*
towards
them
in
his
morning
exercise
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
no
*NL*
stock
on
,
and
his
muscular
arms
,
developed
by
broadsword
and
*NL*
dumbbell
,
weightily
asserting
themselves
through
his
light
*NL*
shirt-sleeves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
servant
,
sir
,
''
says
Mr.
George
with
a
military
salute
.
*NL*
Good-humouredly
smiling
all
over
his
broad
forehead
up
into
his
crisp
*NL*
hair
,
he
then
defers
to
Miss
Flite
,
as
,
with
great
stateliness
,
and
*NL*
at
some
length
,
she
performs
the
courtly
ceremony
of
presentation
.
He
*NL*
winds
it
up
with
another
``
Your
servant
,
sir
!
''
and
another
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
.
A
sailor
,
I
believe
?
''
says
Mr.
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
proud
to
find
I
have
the
air
of
one
,
''
returns
Allan
;
``
but
I
am
*NL*
only
a
sea-going
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
!
I
should
have
thought
you
was
a
regular
blue-jacket
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
hopes
Mr.
George
will
forgive
his
intrusion
the
more
readily
on
*NL*
that
account
,
and
particularly
that
he
will
not
lay
aside
his
pipe
,
*NL*
which
,
in
his
politeness
,
he
has
testified
some
intention
of
doing
.
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
sir
,
''
returns
the
trooper
.
``
As
I
know
by
*NL*
experience
that
it
's
not
disagreeable
to
Miss
Flite
,
and
since
it
's
*NL*
equally
agreeable
to
yourself
--
''
and
finishes
the
sentence
by
putting
*NL*
it
between
his
lips
again
.
Allan
proceeds
to
tell
him
all
he
knows
*NL*
about
Jo
,
unto
which
the
trooper
listens
with
a
grave
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
the
lad
,
sir
,
is
it
?
''
he
inquires
,
looking
along
the
*NL*
entry
to
where
Jo
stands
staring
up
at
the
great
letters
on
the
*NL*
whitewashed
front
,
which
have
no
meaning
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
he
,
''
says
Allan
.
``
And
,
Mr.
George
,
I
am
in
this
difficulty
*NL*
about
him
.
I
am
unwilling
to
place
him
in
a
hospital
,
even
if
I
could
*NL*
procure
him
immediate
admission
,
because
I
foresee
that
he
would
not
*NL*
stay
there
many
hours
if
he
could
be
so
much
as
got
there
.
The
same
*NL*
objection
applies
to
a
workhouse
,
supposing
I
had
the
patience
to
be
*NL*
evaded
and
shirked
,
and
handed
about
from
post
to
pillar
in
trying
to
*NL*
get
him
into
one
,
which
is
a
system
that
I
do
n't
take
kindly
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
man
does
,
sir
,
''
returns
Mr.
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
convinced
that
he
would
not
remain
in
either
place
,
because
he
*NL*
is
possessed
by
an
extraordinary
terror
of
this
person
who
ordered
*NL*
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
;
in
his
ignorance
,
he
believes
this
person
*NL*
to
be
everywhere
,
and
cognizant
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
says
Mr.
George
.
``
But
you
have
not
*NL*
mentioned
that
party
's
name

Is
it
a
secret
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
boy
makes
it
one

But
his
name
is
Bucket

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bucket
the
detective

sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man

known

returns
the
trooper
after
blowing
out
*NL*
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
squaring
his
chest
,
``
and
the
boy
is
so
far
*NL*
correct
that
he
undoubtedly
is
a

rum
customer

''
Mr.
George
smokes
*NL*
with
a
profound
meaning
after
this
and
surveys
Miss
Flite
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
wish
Mr.
Jarndyce

Miss
Summerson
at

to
know
that

tells
so
strange
a

has
reappeared
,
and
to
have
it
*NL*
in
their
power
to
speak
with
him
if
they
should
desire
to
do
so
.
*NL*
Therefore
I
want
to
get
him
,
for
the
present
moment
,
into
any
poor
*NL*
lodging
kept
by
decent
people
where
he
would
be
admitted
.
Decent
*NL*
people

Jo

Mr.
George

''
says
Allan
,
following
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
trooper
's
eyes
along
the
entry
,
``
have
not
been
much
acquainted
,
*NL*
as
you
see

Hence
the
difficulty

Do
you
happen
to

one
in

this
neighbourhood
who
would
receive
him
for
a

on
my
paying
for
*NL*
him
beforehand

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
puts
the
question
,
he
becomes
aware
of
a
dirty-faced
little
man
*NL*
standing
at
the
trooper
's
elbow
and
looking
up
,
with
an
oddly
twisted
*NL*
figure
and
countenance
,
into
the
trooper
's
face
.
After
a
few
more
*NL*
puffs
at
his
pipe
,
the
trooper
looks
down
askant
at
the
little
man
,
*NL*
and
the
little
man
winks
up
at
the
trooper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

says
Mr.

``
I
can
assure
you

willingly

knocked
on
the
head
at
any
time
if
it
would
be
at
all
*NL*
agreeable
to
Miss
Summerson
,
and
consequently
I
esteem
it
a
privilege
*NL*
to
do
that
young
lady
any
service

however
small

We
are
naturally
in
*NL*
the
vagabond
way
here

both
myself

You
see
what
the

You
are
welcome

would
meet

With
a
comprehensive
wave
of
his
pipe

Mr.

places
the
whole

building
at
his
visitor

disposal

*NL*
*NL*
``

Allan

Allan

repeating

former
assurance

*NL*

Mr.

tacks
out

all
on

side

to
execute
the

the

having
smoked
his

lays
it
by

Jo

brought

in

He

He
shuffles
slowly
into
Mr.

gallery
and
stands
huddled
*NL*
together
in
a
bundle
,
looking
all
about
the
floor

He
seems
to
know

that

have
an
inclination
to
shrink
from
him

partly
for
what
he

partly
for
what

He
,
too

shrinks
from

He
*NL*
is
not
of
the

order

not

down
again

Jo
makes
a

be

a

the

turning
to
his

bears
down
upon

man

it

``

Mr.

in

martial

*NL*
*NL*
Phil
Squod
and
Jo
are
sent
out
immediately
on
this
work
of
*NL*
improvement

Miss
Flite
,
quite
enraptured
by
her
success
,
makes
the
*NL*
best
of
her
way
to
court

having
great
fears
that
otherwise
her

friend
the
Chancellor
may
be
uneasy
about

may
give
the

judgment
she
has
so
long

observing

``
which
you

Allan
takes
the
opportunity
of

going
out
to
procure
some
restorative
medicines

obtaining
them

near
at

soon
returns
to
find
the

walking
up

down

the

to
fall
into

and
walk
with
him

*NL*
``

me

probable

The

looks
sideways
at
Allan

sunburnt
cheek

bright
dark
*NL*
eye
,
rapidly
measures
his
height

build

seems
to
approve

him

*NL*
*NL*

looks
at

inquiringly

naturally
asks

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

then
I
'll
tell
you

returns
the
trooper
,
stopping
short
*NL*
and
folding
his
arms
on
his
square
chest
so
angrily
that
his
face
*NL*
fires
and
flushes
all
over
;
``
he
is
a
confoundedly
bad
kind
of
man

He
*NL*
is
a
slow-torturing
kind
of

is
no
more
like
flesh

blood
*NL*
than
a
rusty
old
carbine
is

He
is
a
kind
of
man

that
*NL*
has
caused
me
more
restlessness

more
uneasiness

more

dissatisfaction

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry

says
Allan
,
``
to
have
touched
so
sore
a
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sore

''
The
trooper
plants
his
legs
wider
apart
,
wets
the
palm
of
his
*NL*
broad
right
hand
,
and
lays
it
on
the
imaginary
moustache
.
``
It
's
no
*NL*
fault

yours

you
shall
judge

He
has
got
a
power
over
me

*NL*
He
is
the
man
I
spoke
of
just
now
as
being
able
to
tumble
me
out
of
*NL*
this
place
neck
and
crop
.
He
keeps
me
on
a
constant
see-saw
.
He
wo
n't
*NL*
hold
off
,
and
he
wo
n't
come
on

If
I
have
a
payment
to
make
him

time
to
ask
him
for

anything

go
to
him
about

me
on

passes
me
back
again

keeps
me
prowling

dangling
about

was
made

himself

Why

I
spend
half
my
life
now

pretty
well
,
*NL*
loitering
and
dodging
about
his
door

What
does
he
care

Nothing
.
*NL*
Just
as
much
as
the
rusty
old
carbine
I
have
compared
him
to

He
*NL*
chafes
and
goads
me
till
--
Bah

Nonsense

am
forgetting

Mr.

Woodcourt
,
''
the
trooper
resumes
his
march
,
``
all
I
say
is
,
he
is
an
*NL*
old
man
;
but
I
am
glad
I
shall
never
have
the
chance
of
setting
spurs
*NL*
to
my
horse
and
riding
at
him
in
a
fair
field
.
For
if
I
had
that
*NL*
chance
,
in
one
of
the
humours
he
drives
me
into
--
he
'd
go
down
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
has
been
so
excited
that
he
finds
it
necessary
to
wipe
his
*NL*
forehead
on
his
shirt-sleeve
.
Even
while
he
whistles
his
impetuosity
*NL*
away
with
the
national
anthem
,
some
involuntary
shakings
of
his
head
*NL*
and
heavings
of
his
chest
still
linger
behind
,
not
to
mention
an
*NL*
occasional
hasty
adjustment
with
both
hands
of
his
open
shirt-collar
,
*NL*
as
if
it
were
scarcely
open
enough
to
prevent
his
being
troubled
by
a
*NL*
choking
sensation
.
In
short
,
Allan
Woodcourt
has
not
much
doubt
about
*NL*
the
going
down
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
on
the
field
referred
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
and
his
conductor
presently
return
,
and
Jo
is
assisted
to
his
*NL*
mattress
by
the
careful
Phil
,
to
whom
,
after
due
administration
of
*NL*
medicine
by
his
own
hands
,
Allan
confides
all
needful
means
and
*NL*
instructions
.
The
morning
is
by
this
time
getting
on
apace
.
He
*NL*
repairs
to
his
lodgings
to
dress
and
breakfast
,
and
then
,
without
*NL*
seeking
rest
,
goes
away
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
to
communicate
his
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
him
Mr.
Jarndyce
returns
alone
,
confidentially
telling
him
that
*NL*
there
are
reasons
for
keeping
this
matter
very
quiet
indeed
and
*NL*
showing
a
serious
interest
in
it
.
To
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
Jo
repeats
in
*NL*
substance
what
he
said
in
the
morning
,
without
any
material
*NL*
variation
.
Only
that
cart
of
his
is
heavier
to
draw
,
and
draws
with
a
*NL*
hollower
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
lay
here
quiet
and
not
be
chivied
no
more
,
''
falters
Jo
,
``
and
*NL*
be
so
kind

person
as
is
a-passin
nigh
where
I
used
fur
to
sleep

as
jist
to
say
to
Mr.
Sangsby
that
Jo

known
once

is
a-moving
*NL*
on
right

with
his
duty

I
'll
be
wery
thankful

I
'd
be
*NL*
more
thankful
than
I
am
aready
if
it
wos
any
ways
possible
for
an
*NL*
unfortnet
to
be
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
makes
so
many
of
these
references
to
the
law-stationer
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
day
or
two
that
Allan
,
after
conferring
with
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
good-naturedly
resolves
to
call
in
Cook
's
Court
,
the
*NL*
rather
,
as
the
cart
seems
to
be
breaking
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Cook
's
Court
,
therefore
,
he
repairs
.
Mr.
Snagsby
is
behind
his
*NL*
counter
in
his
grey
coat
and
sleeves
,
inspecting
an
indenture
of
*NL*
several
skins
which
has
just
come
in
from
the
engrosser
's
,
an
immense
*NL*
desert
of
law-hand
and
parchment
,
with
here
and
there
a
resting-place
*NL*
of
a
few
large
letters
to
break
the
awful
monotony
and
save
the
*NL*
traveller
from
despair
.
Mr
Snagsby
puts
up
at
one
of
these
inky
wells
*NL*
and
greets
the
stranger
with
his
cough
of
general
preparation
for
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
remember
me
,
Mr.
Snagsby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stationer
's
heart
begins
to
thump
heavily
,
for
his
old
*NL*
apprehensions
have
never
abated
.
It
is
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
*NL*
answer
,
``
No
,
sir
,
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
.
I
should
have
considered
--
not
to
*NL*
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
--
that
I
never
saw
you
before
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twice
before
,
''
says
Allan
Woodcourt
.
``
Once
at
a
poor
bedside
,
and
*NL*
once
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
come
at
last
!
''
thinks
the
afflicted
stationer
,
as
recollection
*NL*
breaks
upon
him
.
``
It
's
got
to
a
head
now
and
is
going
to
burst
!
''
But
*NL*
he
has
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
conduct
his
visitor
into
the
*NL*
little
counting-house
and
to
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
married
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
am
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
make
the
attempt
,
though
single

''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
in
a
*NL*
melancholy
whisper
,
``
to
speak
as
low
as
you
can
?
For
my
little
woman
*NL*
is
a-listening
somewheres
,
or
I
'll
forfeit
the
business
and
five
*NL*
hundred
pound
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
deep
dejection
Mr.
Snagsby
sits
down
on
his
stool
,
with
his
back
*NL*
against
his
desk
,
protesting
,
``
I
never
had
a
secret
of
my
own
,
sir
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
charge
my
memory
with
ever
having
once
attempted
to
deceive
my
*NL*
little
woman
on
my
own
account
since
she
named
the
day
.
I
would
n't
*NL*
have
done
it
,
sir
.
Not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
,
I
could
n't
*NL*
have
done
it
,
I
durs
n't
have
done
it

Whereas
,
and
nevertheless
,
I
*NL*
find
myself
wrapped
round
with
secrecy
and
mystery
,
till
my
life
is
a
*NL*
burden
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
visitor
professes
his
regret
to
hear
it
and
asks
him
does
he
*NL*
remember
Jo
.
Mr.
Snagsby
answers
with
a
suppressed
groan
,
oh
,
do
n't
*NL*
he
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
name
an
individual
human
being
--
except
myself
--
that
my
*NL*
little
woman
is
more
set
and
determined
against
than
Jo
,
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
asks
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
repeats
Mr.
Snagsby
,
in
his
desperation
clutching
at
the
clump
*NL*
of
hair
at
the
back
of
his
bald
head
.
``
How
should
I
know
why
?
But
you
*NL*
are
a
single
person
,
sir
,
and
may
you
long
be
spared
to
ask
a
married
*NL*
person
such
a
question
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
beneficent
wish
,
Mr.
Snagsby
coughs
a
cough
of
dismal
*NL*
resignation
and
submits
himself
to
hear
what
the
visitor
has
to
*NL*
communicate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
again
!
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
,
who
,
between
the
earnestness
of
his
*NL*
feelings
and
the
suppressed
tones
of
his
voice
is
discoloured
in
the
*NL*
face
.
``
At
it
again
,
in
a
new
direction
!
A
certain
person
charges
me
,
*NL*
in
the
solemnest
way
,
not
to
talk
of
Jo
to
any
one
,
even
my
little
*NL*
woman
.
Then
comes
another
certain
person
,
in
the
person
of
yourself
,
*NL*
and
charges
me
,
in
an
equally
solemn
way
,
not
to
mention
Jo
to
that
*NL*
other
certain
person
above
all
other
persons
.
Why
,
this
is
a
private
*NL*
asylum
!
Why
,
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
,
this
is
Bedlam
,
*NL*
sir
!
''
says
Mr.
Snagsby
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
better
than
he
expected
after
all
,
being
no
explosion
of
*NL*
the
mine
below
him
or
deepening
of
the
pit
into
which
he
has
fallen
.
*NL*
And
being
tender-hearted
and
affected
by
the
account
he
hears
of
Jo
's
*NL*
condition
,
he
readily
engages
to
``
look
round
''
as
early
in
the
evening
*NL*
as
he
can
manage
it
quietly
.
He
looks
round
very
quietly
when
the
*NL*
evening
comes
,
but
it
may
turn
out
that
Mrs.
Snagsby
is
as
quiet
a
*NL*
manager
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
is
very
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
and
says
,
when
they
are
left
*NL*
alone
,
that
he
takes
it
uncommon
kind
as
Mr.
Sangsby
should
come
so
*NL*
far
out
of
his
way
on
accounts
of
sich
as
him
.
Mr.
Snagsby
,
touched
*NL*
by
the
spectacle
before
him
,
immediately
lays
upon
the
table
half
a
*NL*
crown
,
that
magic
balsam
of
his
for
all
kinds
of
wounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
find
yourself
,
my
poor
lad
?
''
inquires
the
stationer
*NL*
with
his
cough
of
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
luck
,
Mr.
Sangsby
,
I
am
,
''
returns
Jo
,
``
and
do
n't

but
I
did

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stationer
softly
lays
down
another
half-crown
and
asks
him
what
*NL*
it
is
that
he
is
sorry
for
having
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Sangsby

says
Jo
,
``
I
went
and
giv
a

*NL*
*NL*
The
softened
stationer
deposits
another
half-crown
on
the
table
.
*NL*
Nothing
less
than
a
repetition
of
that
infallible
remedy
will
relieve
*NL*
his
feelings

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
meek
little
stationer
,
with
a
broken
and
unfinished
cough
,
slips
*NL*
down
his
fourth
half-crown
--
he
has
never
been
so
close
to
a
case
*NL*
requiring
so
many
--
and
is
fain
to
depart
.
And
Jo

upon

little

no

No

*NL*
For
the
cart
so
hard
to
draw
is
near
its
journey
's
end
and
drags
over
*NL*
stony
ground
.
All
round
the
clock
it
labours
up
the
broken
steps
,
*NL*
shattered
and
worn
.
Not
many
times
can
the
sun
rise
and
behold
it
*NL*
still
upon
its
weary
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phil
Squod
,
with
his
smoky
gunpowder
visage
,
at
once
acts
as
nurse
*NL*
and
works
as
armourer
at
his
little
table
in
a
corner
,
often
looking
*NL*
round
and
saying
with
a
nod
of
his
green-baize
cap
and
an
encouraging
*NL*
elevation
of
his
one
eyebrow
,
``
Hold
up
,
my
boy
!
Hold
up
!
''
There
,
too
,
*NL*
is
Mr.
Jarndyce
many
a
time
,
and
Allan
Woodcourt
almost
always
,
both
*NL*
thinking
,
much
,
how
strangely
fate
has
entangled
this
rough
outcast
*NL*
in
the
web
of
very
different
lives
.
There
,
too
,
the
trooper
is
a
*NL*
frequent
visitor
,
filling
the
doorway
with
his
athletic
figure
and
,
*NL*
from
his
superfluity
of
life
and
strength
,
seeming
to
shed
down
*NL*
temporary
vigour
upon
Jo
,
who
never
fails
to
speak
more
robustly
in
*NL*
answer
to
his
cheerful
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
is
in
a
sleep
or
in
a
stupor
to-day
,
and
Allan
Woodcourt
,
newly
*NL*
arrived
,
stands
by
him
,
looking
down
upon
his
wasted
form
.
After
a
*NL*
while
he
softly
seats
himself
upon
the
bedside
with
his
face
towards
*NL*
him
--
just
as
he
sat
in
the
law-writer
's
room
--
and
touches
his
chest
*NL*
and
heart
.
The
cart
had
very
nearly
given
up
,
but
labours
on
a
little
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
stands
in
the
doorway
,
still
and
silent
.
Phil
has
stopped
*NL*
in
a
low
clinking
noise
,
with
his
little
hammer
in
his
hand
.
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
looks
round
with
that
grave
professional
interest
and
*NL*
attention
on
his
face
,
and
glancing
significantly
at
the
trooper
,
*NL*
signs
to
Phil
to
carry
his
table
out
.
When
the
little
hammer
is
next
*NL*
used
,
there
will
be
a
speck
of
rust
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jo
!
What
is
the
matter
?
Do
n't
be
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
says
Jo
,
who
has
started
and
is
looking
round
,
``
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
in
Tom-all-Alone
's
agin
.
Ai
n't
there
nobody
here

you

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
Jo
closes
his
eyes
,
muttering
,
``
I
'm
wery
thankful

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
watching
him
closely
a
little
while
,
Allan
puts
his
mouth
very
*NL*
near
his
ear
and
says
to
him
in
a
low
,
distinct
voice
,
``
Jo
!
Did
you
*NL*
ever
know
a
prayer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Mr.

he
wos
a-prayin

at
Mr.

Sangsby

and
I
heerd
him
,
but
he
sounded
as
if
he
wos
a-speakin
to
*NL*
hisself
,
and
not
to
me
.
He
prayed
a
lot
,
but
I
could
n't
make
out
*NL*
nothink
on
it
.
Different
times
there
was
other
genlmen
come
down
*NL*
Tom-all-Alone
's
a-prayin
,
but
they
all
mostly
sed
as
the
t
`
other
*NL*
`
wuns
prayed
wrong
,
and
all
mostly
sounded
to
be
a-talking
to
*NL*
theirselves
,
or
a-passing
blame
on
the
t
`
others
,
and
not
a-talkin
to

WE
never

nothink

I
never

what
it
wos
all
about

*NL*
*NL*
It
takes
him
a
long
time
to
say
this
,
and
few
but
an
experienced
and
*NL*
attentive
listener
could
hear
,
or
,
hearing
,
understand
him
.
After
a
*NL*
short
relapse
into
sleep
or
stupor
,
he
makes
,
of
a
sudden
,
a
strong
*NL*
effort
to
get
out
of
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

CHAPTER
XLVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Closing
In
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
in
Lincolnshire
has
shut
its
many
eyes
again
,
and
the
house
*NL*
in
town
is
awake
.
In
Lincolnshire
the
Dedlocks
of
the
past
doze
in
*NL*
their
picture-frames
,
and
the
low
wind
murmurs
through
the
long
*NL*
drawing-room
as
if
they
were
breathing
pretty
regularly
.
In
town
the
*NL*
Dedlocks
of
the
present
rattle
in
their
fire-eyed
carriages
through
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
and
the
Dedlock
Mercuries
,
with
ashes
-LRB-
or
*NL*
hair-powder
-RRB-
on
their
heads
,
symptomatic
of
their
great
humility
,
*NL*
loll
away
the
drowsy
mornings
in
the
little
windows
of
the
hall
.
The
*NL*
fashionable
world
--
tremendous
orb
,
nearly
five
miles
round
--
is
in
*NL*
full
swing
,
and
the
solar
system
works
respectfully
at
its
appointed
*NL*
distances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
the
throng
is
thickest
,
where
the
lights
are
brightest
,
where
*NL*
all
the
senses
are
ministered
to
with
the
greatest
delicacy
and
*NL*
refinement
,
Lady
Dedlock
is
.
From
the
shining
heights
she
has
scaled
*NL*
and
taken
,
she
is
never
absent
.
Though
the
belief
she
of
old
reposed
*NL*
in
herself
as
one
able
to
reserve
whatsoever
she
would
under
*NL*
her
mantle
of
pride
is
beaten
down
,
though
she
has
no
assurance
*NL*
that
what
she
is
to
those
around
her
she
will
remain
another
day
,
*NL*
it
is
not
in
her
nature
when
envious
eyes
are
looking
on
to
*NL*
yield
or
to
droop
.
They
say
of
her
that
she
has
lately
grown
*NL*
more
handsome
and
more
haughty
.
The
debilitated
cousin
says
of
*NL*
her
that
she
's
beauty

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
says
nothing
,
looks
nothing
.
Now
,
as
heretofore
,
he
*NL*
is
to
be
found
in
doorways
of
rooms
,
with
his
limp
white
cravat
*NL*
loosely
twisted
into
its
old-fashioned
tie
,
receiving
patronage
from
*NL*
the
peerage
and
making
no
sign
.
Of
all
men
he
is
still
the
last
who
*NL*
might
be
supposed
to
have
any
influence
upon
my
Lady
.
Of
all
women
*NL*
she
is
still
the
last
who
might
be
supposed
to
have
any
dread
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
has
been
much
on
her
mind
since
their
late
interview
in
his
*NL*
turret-room
at
Chesney
Wold
.
She
is
now
decided
,
and
prepared
to
*NL*
throw
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
morning
in
the
great
world
,
afternoon
according
to
the
little
*NL*
sun
.
The
Mercuries
,
exhausted
by
looking
out
of
window
,
are
reposing
*NL*
in
the
hall
and
hang
their
heavy
heads
,
the
gorgeous
creatures
,
like
*NL*
overblown
sunflowers
.
Like
them
,
too
,
they
seem
to
run
to
a
deal
of
*NL*
seed
in
their
tags
and
trimmings
.
Sir
Leicester
,
in
the
library
,
has
*NL*
fallen
asleep
for
the
good
of
the
country
over
the
report
of
a
*NL*
Parliamentary
committee
.
My
Lady
sits
in
the
room
in
which
she
gave
*NL*
audience
to
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
.
Rosa
is
with
her
and
*NL*
has
been
writing
for
her
and
reading
to
her
.
Rosa
is
now
at
work
upon
*NL*
embroidery
or
some
such
pretty
thing
,
and
as
she
bends
her
head
over
*NL*
it
,
my
Lady
watches
her
in
silence
.
Not
for
the
first
time
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pretty
village
face
looks
brightly
up
.
Then
,
seeing
how
serious
*NL*
my
Lady
is
,
looks
puzzled
and
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
to
the
door
.
Is
it
shut
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
She
goes
to
it
and
returns
,
and
looks
yet
more
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
about
to
place
confidence
in
you
,
child
,
for
I
know
I
may
trust
*NL*
your
attachment
,
if
not
your
judgment
.
In
what
I
am
going
to
do
,
I
*NL*
will
not
disguise
myself
to
you
at
least
.
But
I
confide
in
you
.
Say
*NL*
nothing
to
any
one
of
what
passes
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
timid
little
beauty
promises
in
all
earnestness
to
be
*NL*
trustworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
Lady
Dedlock
asks
her
,
signing
to
her
to
bring
her
*NL*
chair
nearer
,
``
do
you
know
,
Rosa
,
that
I
am
different
to
you
from
*NL*
what
I
am
to
any
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
Lady

Much
kinder

But
then
I
often
think
I

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
often
think
you
know
me
as
I
really
am

Poor
child

poor

*NL*
*NL*
She
says
it
with
a
kind
of
scorn
--
though
not
of
Rosa
--
and
sits
*NL*
brooding
,
looking
dreamily
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
Rosa
,
you
are
any
relief
or
comfort
to
me

Do
you
*NL*
suppose
your
being
young
and
natural
,
and
fond
of
me
and
grateful
to
*NL*
me

it
any
pleasure
to
me

you
near

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

scarcely

I
wish
it
was
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
,
little
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pretty
face
is
checked
in
its
flush
of
pleasure
by
the
dark
*NL*
expression
on
the
handsome
face
before
it
.
It
looks
timidly
for
an
*NL*
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
were
to
say
to-day
,
`
Go

Leave
me

I
should
say
what
would
*NL*
give
me
great
pain
and
disquiet
,
child
,
and
what
would
leave
me
very
*NL*
solitary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lady
!
Have
I
offended
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
nothing

Come
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
bends
down
on
the
footstool
at
my
Lady
's
feet
.
My
Lady
,
with
*NL*
that
motherly
touch
of
the
famous
ironmaster
night
,
lays
her
hand
*NL*
upon
her
dark
hair
and
gently
keeps
it
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you

that

happy

There
are
reasons

reasons

it

better

You

must
not

I
have
determined

*NL*
*NL*
The
weeping
girl
covers
her
hand
with
kisses
and
says
what
shall
she
*NL*
do
,
what
shall
she
do
,
when

are

Her
mistress
kisses
*NL*
her
on

and
makes
no
other
answer

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
detaches
herself
from
her
simple-hearted
companion
and
leaves
the
*NL*
room
.
Late
in
the
afternoon
,
when
she
next
appears
upon
the
*NL*
staircase
,
she
is
in
her
haughtiest
and
coldest
state
.
As
indifferent
*NL*
as
if
all
passion
,
feeling
,
and
interest
had
been
worn
out
in
the
*NL*
earlier
ages
of
the
world
and
had
perished
from
its
surface
with
its
*NL*
other
departed
monsters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercury
has
announced
Mr.
Rouncewell
,
which
is
the
cause
of
her
*NL*
appearance
.
Mr.
Rouncewell
is
not
in
the
library
,
but
she
repairs
to
*NL*
the
library
.
Sir
Leicester
is
there
,
and
she
wishes
to
speak
to
him
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
,
I
am
desirous
--
but
you
are
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
dear
no
!
Not
at
all
.
Only
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
at
hand
.
Haunting
every
place
.
No
relief
or
security
from
him
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Lady
Dedlock
.
Will
you
allow
me
to
retire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
look
that
plainly
says
,
``
You
know
you
have
the
power
to
remain
*NL*
if
you
will
,
''
she
tells
him
it
is
not
necessary
and
moves
towards
a
*NL*
chair
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
brings
it
a
little
forward
for
her
with
his
*NL*
clumsy
bow
and
retires
into
a
window
opposite
.
Interposed
between
her
*NL*
and
the
fading
light
of
day
in
the
now
quiet
street
,
his
shadow
falls
*NL*
upon
her
,
and
he
darkens
all
before
her
.
Even
so
does
he
darken
her
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
dull
street
under
the
best
conditions
,
where
the
two
long
*NL*
rows
of
houses
stare
at
each
other
with
that
severity
that
*NL*
half-a-dozen
of
its
greatest
mansions
seem
to
have
been
slowly
stared
*NL*
into
stone
rather
than
originally
built
in
that
material
.
It
is
a
*NL*
street
of
such
dismal
grandeur
,
so
determined
not
to
condescend
to
*NL*
liveliness
,
that
the
doors
and
windows
hold
a
gloomy
state
of
their
*NL*
own
in
black
paint
and
dust
,
and
the
echoing
mews
behind
have
a
dry
*NL*
and
massive
appearance
,
as
if
they
were
reserved
to
stable
the
stone
*NL*
chargers
of
noble
statues
.
Complicated
garnish
of
iron-work
entwines
*NL*
itself
over
the
flights
of
steps
in
this
awful
street
,
and
from
these
*NL*
petrified
bowers
,
extinguishers
for
obsolete
flambeaux
gasp
at
the
*NL*
upstart
gas
.
Here
and
there
a
weak
little
iron
hoop
,
through
which
*NL*
bold
boys
aspire
to
throw
their
friends
'
caps
-LRB-
its
only
present
use
-RRB-
,
*NL*
retains
its
place
among
the
rusty
foliage
,
sacred
to
the
memory
of
*NL*
departed
oil
.
Nay
,
even
oil
itself
,
yet
lingering
at
long
intervals
*NL*
in
a
little
absurd
glass
pot
,
with
a
knob
in
the
bottom
like
an
*NL*
oyster
,
blinks
and
sulks
at
newer
lights
every
night
,
like
its
high
*NL*
and
dry
master
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
there
is
not
much
that
Lady
Dedlock
,
seated
in
her
chair
,
*NL*
could
wish
to
see
through
the
window
in
which
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
stands
.
*NL*
And
yet
--
and
yet
--
she
sends
a
look
in
that
direction
as
if
it
were
*NL*
her
heart
's
desire
to
have
that
figure
moved
out
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
begs
his
Lady
's
pardon
.
She
was
about
to
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
that
Mr.
Rouncewell
is
here
-LRB-
he
has
called
by
my
appointment
-RRB-
*NL*

had
better
make
an
end
of
the
question
of
that
girl
.
I
am
*NL*
tired
to
death
of
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
--
to

assist
?
''
demands
Sir
Leicester
in
some
*NL*
considerable
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
him
here
and
have
done
with
it

Will
you
tell
them

send
him
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
be
so
good
as
to
ring

Thank
you

Request

''
says
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
to
Mercury
,
not
immediately
remembering
the
business
*NL*
term
,
``

the
iron
gentleman

walk
this
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercury
departs
in
search
of
the
iron
gentleman
,
finds
,
and
produces
*NL*
him
.
Sir
Leicester
receives
that
ferruginous
person
graciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
are
well

Mr.
Rouncewell

Be
seated

Tulkinghorn

-RRB-

Sir
Leicester
*NL*
skilfully
transfers
him
with
a
solemn
wave
of
his
hand
,
``
was
desirous
*NL*
to
speak
with
you

Hem
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
happy

''
returns
the
iron
gentleman
,
``
to
give
my
best
*NL*
attention
to
anything
Lady
Dedlock
does
me
the
honour
to
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
turns
towards
her
,
he
finds
that
the
impression
she
makes
upon
*NL*
him
is
less
agreeable
than
on
the
former
occasion
.
A
distant
*NL*
supercilious
air
makes
a
cold
atmosphere
about
her
,
and
there
is
*NL*
nothing
in
her
bearing
,
as
there
was
before
,
to
encourage
openness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
sir
,
''
says
Lady
Dedlock
listlessly
,
``
may
I
be
allowed
to
*NL*
inquire
whether
anything
has
passed
between
you

your
son
*NL*
respecting
your

's
fancy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
almost
too
troublesome
to
her
languid
eyes
to
bestow
a
look
*NL*
upon
him
as
she
asks
this
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
memory
serves
me

Lady

I
said

when
I
had
the

pleasure

you
before
,
that
I
should
seriously
advise
my
son
*NL*
to
conquer
that

fancy

The
ironmaster
repeats
her
expression
with
a
*NL*
little
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Of
course

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
gives
a
nod

approving
and
confirmatory

Very
proper

*NL*
The
iron
gentleman
,
having
said
that
he
would
do
it
,
was
bound
to
do
*NL*
it

No
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
base
metals
and
the
*NL*
precious

Highly
proper

done
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

Probably
not

In
our
condition
of
life

we
sometimes
couple
*NL*
an
intention
with
our
--
our
fancies
which
renders
them
not
altogether
*NL*
easy
to
throw
off

I
think
it
is
rather
our
way
to
be
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
has
a
misgiving
that
there
may
be
a
hidden
Wat
Tylerish
*NL*
meaning
in
this
expression
,
and
fumes
a
little
.
Mr.
Rouncewell
is
*NL*
perfectly
good-humoured
and
polite
,
but
within
such
limits
,
evidently
*NL*
adapts
his
tone
to
his
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

proceeds
my
Lady
,
``
I

been
thinking

Sir

flattered

``

I

give

says
Sir

magnificently
laying

for
a
young

that
station
of
life

The
question
then
arises
,
should
that
young
*NL*
woman
be
deprived
of
these
many
advantages
and
that
good
fortune
*NL*
simply
because
she

Sir
Leicester
,
with
an
apologetic
but
*NL*
dignified
inclination
of
his
head
towards
the
ironmaster
,
winds
up
*NL*
his
sentence
--
``
has
attracted
the
notice
of
Mr
Rouncewell
's
son
?
Now
,
*NL*
has
she
deserved
this
punishment

Is
this
just
towards
her
?
Is
this
*NL*
our
previous
understanding
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

interposes
Mr.
Rouncewell
's
son
's
father
.
``
Sir
*NL*
Leicester

will
you
allow
me
?
I
think
I
may
shorten
the
subject

Pray
*NL*
dismiss
that
from
your
consideration
.
If
you
remember
anything
so
*NL*
unimportant
--
which
is
not
to
be
expected
--
you
would
recollect
that
my
*NL*
first
thought
in
the
affair
was
directly
opposed
to
her
remaining
*NL*
here

*NL*
*NL*
Dismiss
the
Dedlock
patronage
from
consideration
?
Oh
!
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
is
bound
to
believe
a
pair
of
ears
that
have
been
handed
down
to
him
*NL*
through
such
a
family
,
or
he
really
might
have
mistrusted
their
*NL*
report
of
the
iron
gentleman
's
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
necessary

observes
my
Lady
in
her
coldest
manner
before
*NL*
he
can
do
anything
but
breathe
amazedly
,
``
to
enter
into
these
matters
*NL*
on
either
side

The
girl
is
a
very
good
girl
;
I
have
nothing
whatever
*NL*
to
say
against
her
,
but
she
is
so
far
insensible
to
her
many
*NL*
advantages
and
her
good
fortune
that
she
is
in
love
--
or
supposes
she
*NL*
is
,
poor
little
fool

and
unable
to
appreciate
them

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
begs
to
observe
that
wholly
alters
the
case
.
He
might
*NL*
have
been
sure
that
my
Lady
had
the
best
grounds
and
reasons
in
*NL*
support
of
her
view
.
He
entirely
agrees
with
my
Lady
.
The
young
woman
*NL*
had
better
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
Sir
Leicester
observed
,
Mr.
Rouncewell
,
on
the
last
occasion
when
*NL*
we
were
fatigued
by
this
business
,

Lady
Dedlock
languidly
proceeds
,
*NL*
``
we
can
not
make
conditions
with
you

Without
conditions
,
and
under
*NL*
present
circumstances
,
the
girl
is
quite
misplaced
here
and
had
*NL*
better
go
.
I
have
told
her
so
.
Would
you
wish
to
have
her
sent
back
*NL*
to
the
village
,
or
would
you
like
to
take
her
with
you
,
or
what
would
*NL*
you
prefer
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Dedlock

if
I
may
speak
plainly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means

*NL*
*NL*
''
--
I
should
prefer
the
course
which
will
the
soonest
relieve
you
of
*NL*
the
incumbrance
and
remove
her
from
her
present
position
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
speak
as
plainly

''
she
returns
with
the
same
studied
*NL*
carelessness
,
``
so
should
I.
Do
I
understand
that
you
will
take
her
*NL*
with
you

The
iron
gentleman
makes
an
iron
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
,
will
you
ring
?

Mr.
Tulkinghorn
steps
forward
from
*NL*
his
window
and
pulls
the
bell
.
``
I
had
forgotten
you

Thank
you

''
He
*NL*
makes
his
usual
bow
and
goes
quietly
back
again
.
Mercury
,
*NL*
swift-responsive
,
appears
,
receives
instructions
whom
to
produce
,
*NL*
skims
away
,
produces
the
aforesaid
,
and
departs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
has
been
crying
and
is
yet
in
distress
.
On
her
coming
in
,
the
*NL*
ironmaster
leaves
his
chair
,
takes
her
arm
in
his
,
and
remains
with
*NL*
her
near
the
door
ready
to
depart

*NL*
``
You
are
taken
charge
of

says
my
Lady
in
her
weary
manner
,
*NL*
``

going
away
well
protected

I
have
mentioned

have
nothing
to
cry
for

*NL*

She

observes
Mr.
Tulkinghorn

loitering
a
little
*NL*
forward
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
``
as

crying

away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

she
is
not
well-bred

you
see

returns
Mr.
Rouncewell
with
*NL*
some
quickness
in
his
manner
,
as
if
he
were
glad
to
have
the
lawyer
*NL*
to
retort
upon
,
``
and
she
is
an
inexperienced
little
thing

knows

no
better

If

remained
here

she
would
have
improved

no
*NL*
doubt

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
''
is
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
composed
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
sobs
out
that
she
is
very
sorry
to
leave
my
Lady
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
happy
at
Chesney
Wold
,
and
has
been
happy
with
my
Lady
,
and
that
*NL*
she
thanks
my
Lady
over
and
over
again
.
``
Out
,
you
silly
little
puss
!

*NL*
says
the
ironmaster
,
checking
her
in
a
low
voice
,
though
not
angrily
.
*NL*
``
Have
a
spirit
,
if
you
're
fond
of
Watt

My
Lady
merely
waves
her
off
*NL*
with
indifference
,
saying
,
``
There

there
,
child
!
You
are
a
good
girl

*NL*
Go
away
!

Sir
Leicester
has
magnificently
disengaged
himself
from
the
*NL*
subject
and
retired
into
the
sanctuary
of
his
blue
coat
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
,
an
indistinct
form
against
the
dark
street
now
dotted
*NL*
with
lamps
,
looms
in
my
Lady
's
view
,
bigger
and
blacker
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
and
Lady
Dedlock
,
''
says
Mr.
Rouncewell
after
a
pause
*NL*
of
a
few
moments
,
``
I
beg
to
take
my
leave
,
with
an
apology
for
having
*NL*
again
troubled
you
,
though
not
of
my
own
act
,
on
this
tiresome
*NL*
subject
.
I
can
very
well
understand
,
I
assure
you
,
how
tiresome
so
*NL*
small
a
matter
must
have
become
to
Lady
Dedlock
.
If
I
am
doubtful
of
*NL*
my
dealing
with
it
,
it
is
only
because
I
did
not
at
first
quietly
*NL*
exert
my
influence
to
take
my
young
friend
here
away
without
*NL*
troubling
you
at
all
.
But
it
appeared
to
me
--
I
dare
say
magnifying
*NL*
the
importance
of
the
thing
--
that
it
was
respectful
to
explain
to
you
*NL*
how
the
matter
stood
and
candid
to
consult
your
wishes
and
*NL*
convenience
.
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
want
of
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
polite
world

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
considers
himself
evoked
out
of
the
sanctuary
by
these
*NL*
remarks
.
``
Mr.
Rouncewell
,
''
he
returns
,
``
do
not
mention
it
.
*NL*
Justifications
are
unnecessary
,
I
hope
,
on
either
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
Sir
Leicester
;
and
if
I
may
,
by
way
of
a
last
*NL*
word
,
revert
to
what
I
said
before
of
my
mother
's
long
connexion
with
*NL*
the
family
and
the
worth
it
bespeaks
on
both
sides
,
I
would
point
out
*NL*
this
little
instance
here
on
my
arm
who
shows
herself
so
affectionate
*NL*
and
faithful
in
parting
and
in
whom
my
mother
,
I
dare
say
,
has
done
*NL*
something
to
awaken
such
feelings
--
though
of
course
Lady
Dedlock
,
by
*NL*
her
heartfelt
interest
and
her
genial
condescension
,
has
done
much
*NL*
more
.

*NL*
*NL*
If
he
mean
this
ironically
,
it
may
be
truer
than
he
thinks
.
He
points
*NL*
it
,
however
,
by
no
deviation
from
his
straightforward
manner
of
*NL*
speech
,
though
in
saying
it
he
turns
towards
that
part
of
the
dim
*NL*
room
where
my
Lady
sits
.
Sir
Leicester
stands
to
return
his
parting
*NL*
salutation
,
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
again
rings
,
Mercury
takes
another
*NL*
flight
,
and
Mr.
Rouncewell
and
Rosa
leave
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
lights
are
brought
in
,
discovering
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
still
*NL*
standing
in
his
window
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
my
Lady
still
*NL*
sitting
with
his
figure
before
her
,
closing
up
her
view
of
the
night
*NL*
as
well
as
of
the
day
.
She
is
very
pale
.
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
observing
*NL*
it
as
she
rises
to
retire
,
thinks
,
``
Well
she
may
be
!
The
power
of
*NL*
this
woman
is
astonishing
.
She
has
been
acting
a
part
the
whole
*NL*
time
.
''
But
he
can
act
a
part
too
--
his
one
unchanging
character
--
and
*NL*
as
he
holds
the
door
open
for
this
woman
,
fifty
pairs
of
eyes
,
each
*NL*
fifty
times
sharper
than
Sir
Leicester
's
pair
,
should
find
no
flaw
in
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
dines
alone
in
her
own
room
to-day
.
Sir
Leicester
is
*NL*
whipped
in
to
the
rescue
of
the
Doodle
Party
and
the
discomfiture
of
*NL*
the
Coodle
Faction
.
Lady
Dedlock
asks
on
sitting
down
to
dinner
,
*NL*
still
deadly
pale
-LRB-
and
quite
an
illustration
of
the
debilitated
*NL*
cousin
's
text
-RRB-
,
whether
he
is
gone
out
?
Yes
.
Whether
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
is
gone
yet
?
No
.
Presently
she
asks
again
,
is
he
gone
YET
?
No
.
What
*NL*
is
he
doing
?
Mercury
thinks
he
is
writing
letters
in
the
library
.
*NL*
Would
my
Lady
wish
to
see
him
?
Anything
but
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
wishes
to
see
my
Lady
.
Within
a
few
more
minutes
he
is
*NL*
reported
as
sending
his
respects
,
and
could
my
Lady
please
to
receive
*NL*
him
for
a
word
or
two
after
her
dinner
?
My
Lady
will
receive
him
now
.
*NL*
He
comes
now
,
apologizing
for
intruding
,
even
by
her
permission
,
*NL*
while
she
is
at
table
.
When
they
are
alone
,
my
Lady
waves
her
hand
to
*NL*
dispense
with
such
mockeries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Lady
Dedlock

says
the
lawyer
,
taking
a
chair
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
from
her
and
slowly
rubbing
his
rusty
legs
up
and
down
,
up
*NL*
and
down
,
up
and
down
,
``
I
am
rather
surprised

taken

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

decidedly

I
was
not
prepared

I
consider
it
a
departure

your
promise

It
puts
us
in
a
new
position

I
feel
myself
under
the
necessity

saying
that
I

*NL*
*NL*
He
stops
in
his
rubbing
and
looks
at
her
,
with
his
hands
on
his
*NL*
knees
.
Imperturbable
and
unchangeable
as
he
is
,
there
is
still
an
*NL*
indefinable
freedom
in
his
manner
which
is
new

which
does
not

escape

the

crossing
his

nursing
the
uppermost
knee

``
I
object

interrupts

This
she
says
with
great
deliberation

distinctness

with
no

at
Chesney
Wold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
coolly
getting
up
and
standing
on
the
*NL*
hearth
.
``
Yes
.
I
recollect
,
Lady
Dedlock
,
that
you
certainly
referred
*NL*
to
the
girl
,
but
that
was
before
we
came
to
our
arrangement
,
and
both
*NL*
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
our
arrangement
altogether
precluded
any
*NL*
action
on
your
part
founded
upon
my
discovery
.
There
can
be
no
doubt
*NL*
about
that
.
As
to
sparing
the
girl
,
of
what
importance
or
value
is
*NL*
she
?
Spare
!
Lady
Dedlock
,
here
is
a
family
name
compromised
.
One
*NL*
might
have
supposed
that
the
course
was
straight
on
--
over
everything
,
*NL*
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
regardless
of
all
*NL*
considerations
in
the
way
,
sparing
nothing
,
treading
everything
under
*NL*
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
has
been
looking
at
the
table
.
She
lifts
up
her
eyes
and
looks
at
*NL*
him
.
There
is
a
stern
expression
on
her
face
and
a
part
of
her
lower
*NL*
lip
is
compressed
under
her
teeth
.
``
This
woman
understands
me
,
''
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
thinks
as
she
lets
her
glance
fall
again
.
``
SHE
can
not
be
*NL*
spared
.
Why
should
she
spare
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
little
while
they
are
silent
.
Lady
Dedlock
has
eaten
no
dinner
,
*NL*
but
has
twice
or
thrice
poured
out
water
with
a
steady
hand
and
drunk
*NL*
it
.
She
rises
from
table
,
takes
a
lounging-chair
,
and
reclines
in
it
,
*NL*
shading
her
face
.
There
is
nothing
in
her
manner
to
express
weakness
*NL*
or
excite
compassion
.
It
is
thoughtful
,
gloomy
,
concentrated
.
``
This
*NL*
woman
,
''
thinks
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
standing
on
the
hearth
,
again
a
dark
*NL*
object
closing
up
her
view
,
``
is
a
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
studies
her
at
his
leisure
,
not
speaking
for
a
time
.
She
too
*NL*
studies
something
at
her
leisure
.
She
is
not
the
first
to
speak
,
*NL*
appearing
indeed
so
unlikely
to
be
so
,
though
he
stood
there
until
*NL*
midnight
,
that
even
he
is
driven
upon
breaking
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Dedlock
,
the
most
disagreeable
part
of
this
business
interview
*NL*
remains
,
but
it
is
business
.
Our
agreement
is
broken
.
A
lady
of
your
*NL*
sense
and
strength
of
character
will
be
prepared
for
my
now
declaring
*NL*
it
void
and
taking
my
own
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
inclines
his
head
.
``
That
is
all
I
have
to
trouble
you
*NL*
with
,
Lady
Dedlock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stops
him
as
he
is
moving
out
of
the
room
by
asking
,
``
This
is
the
*NL*
notice
I
was
to
receive
?
I
wish
not
to
misapprehend
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
the
notice
you
were
to
receive
,
Lady
Dedlock
,
because
*NL*
the
contemplated
notice
supposed
the
agreement
to
have
been
observed
.
*NL*
But
virtually
the
same
,
virtually
the
same
.
The
difference
is
merely
*NL*
in
a
lawyer
's
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
intend
to
give
me
no
other
notice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
.
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
contemplate
undeceiving
Sir
Leicester
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
home
question
!
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
with
a
slight
smile
and
*NL*
cautiously
shaking
his
head
at
the
shaded
face
.
``
No
,
not
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
things
considered
,
I
had
better
decline
answering
that
question
,
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
.
If
I
were
to
say
I
do
n't
know
when
,
exactly
,
you
would
*NL*
not
believe
me
,
and
it
would
answer
no
purpose
.
It
may
be
to-morrow
.
*NL*
I
would
rather
say
no
more
.
You
are
prepared
,
and
I
hold
out
no
*NL*
expectations
which
circumstances
might
fail
to
justify
.
I
wish
you
*NL*
good
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
removes
her
hand
,
turns
her
pale
face
towards
him
as
he
walks
*NL*
silently
to
the
door
,
and
stops
him
once
again
as
he
is
about
to
open
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
intend
to
remain
in
the
house
any
time
?
I
heard
you
were
*NL*
writing
in
the
library
.
Are
you
going
to
return
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
my
hat
.
I
am
going
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bows
her
eyes
rather
than
her
head
,
the
movement
is
so
slight
and
*NL*
curious
,
and
he
withdraws
.
Clear
of
the
room
he
looks
at
his
watch
*NL*
but
is
inclined
to
doubt
it
by
a
minute
or
thereabouts
.
There
is
a
*NL*
splendid
clock
upon
the
staircase
,
famous
,
as
splendid
clocks
not
*NL*
often
are
,
for
its
accuracy
.
``
And
what
do
YOU
say
,
''
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
inquires
,
referring
to
it
.
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
said
now
,
``
Do
n't
go
home
!
''
What
a
famous
clock
,
hereafter
,
if
*NL*
it
said
to-night
of
all
the
nights
that
it
has
counted
off
,
to
this
*NL*
old
man
of
all
the
young
and
old
men
who
have
ever
stood
before
it
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
home
!
''
With
its
sharp
clear
bell
it
strikes
three
quarters
*NL*
after
seven
and
ticks
on
again
.
``
Why
,
you
are
worse
than
I
thought
*NL*
you
,
''
says
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
muttering
reproof
to
his
watch
.
``
Two
*NL*
minutes
wrong
?
At
this
rate
you
wo
n't
last
my
time
.
''
What
a
watch
to
*NL*
return
good
for
evil
if
it
ticked
in
answer
,
``
Do
n't
go
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passes
out
into
the
streets
and
walks
on
,
with
his
hands
behind
*NL*
him
,
under
the
shadow
of
the
lofty
houses
,
many
of
whose
mysteries
,
*NL*
difficulties
,
mortgages
,
delicate
affairs
of
all
kinds
,
are
treasured
*NL*
up
within
his
old
black
satin
waistcoat
.
He
is
in
the
confidence
of
*NL*
the
very
bricks
and
mortar
.
The
high
chimney-stacks
telegraph
family
*NL*
secrets
to
him
.
Yet
there
is
not
a
voice
in
a
mile
of
them
to
*NL*
whisper
,
``
Do
n't
go
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
stir
and
motion
of
the
commoner
streets
;
through
the
roar
*NL*
and
jar
of
many
vehicles
,
many
feet
,
many
voices
;
with
the
blazing
*NL*
shop-lights
lighting
him
on
,
the
west
wind
blowing
him
on
,
and
the
*NL*
crowd
pressing
him
on
,
he
is
pitilessly
urged
upon
his
way
,
and
*NL*
nothing
meets
him
murmuring
,
``
Do
n't
go
home
!
''
Arrived
at
last
in
his
*NL*
dull
room
to
light
his
candles
,
and
look
round
and
up
,
and
see
the
*NL*
Roman
pointing
from
the
ceiling
,
there
is
no
new
significance
in
the
*NL*
Roman
's
hand
to-night
or
in
the
flutter
of
the
attendant
groups
to
*NL*
give
him
the
late
warning
,
``
Do
n't
come
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
moonlight
night
,
but
the
moon
,
being
past
the
full
,
is
only
*NL*
now
rising
over
the
great
wilderness
of
London
.
The
stars
are
shining
*NL*
as
they
shone
above
the
turret-leads
at
Chesney
Wold
.
This
woman
,
as
*NL*
he
has
of
late
been
so
accustomed
to
call
her
,
looks
out
upon
them
.
*NL*
Her
soul
is
turbulent
within
her
;
she
is
sick
at
heart
and
restless
.
*NL*
The
large
rooms
are
too
cramped
and
close
.
She
can
not
endure
their
*NL*
restraint
and
will
walk
alone
in
a
neighbouring
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
capricious
and
imperious
in
all
she
does
to
be
the
cause
of
much
*NL*
surprise
in
those
about
her
as
to
anything
she
does
,
this
woman
,
*NL*
loosely
muffled
,
goes
out
into
the
moonlight
.
Mercury
attends
with
*NL*
the
key
.
Having
opened
the
garden-gate
,
he
delivers
the
key
into
his
*NL*
Lady
's
hands
at
her
request
and
is
bidden
to
go
back
.
She
will
walk
*NL*
there
some
time
to
ease
her
aching
head
.
She
may
be
an
hour
,
she
may
*NL*
be
more
.
She
needs
no
further
escort
.
The
gate
shuts
upon
its
spring
*NL*
with
a
clash
,
and
he
leaves
her
passing
on
into
the
dark
shade
of
*NL*
some
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fine
night
,
and
a
bright
large
moon
,
and
multitudes
of
stars
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
,
in
repairing
to
his
cellar
and
in
opening
and
shutting
*NL*
those
resounding
doors
,
has
to
cross
a
little
prison-like
yard
.
He
*NL*
looks
up
casually
,
thinking
what
a
fine
night
,
what
a
bright
large
*NL*
moon
,
what
multitudes
of
stars
!
A
quiet
night
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
quiet
night
.
When
the
moon
shines
very
brilliantly
,
a
solitude
*NL*
and
stillness
seem
to
proceed
from
her
that
influence
even
crowded
*NL*
places
full
of
life
.
Not
only
is
it
a
still
night
on
dusty
high
roads
*NL*
and
on
hill-summits
,
whence
a
wide
expanse
of
country
may
be
seen
in
*NL*
repose
,
quieter
and
quieter
as
it
spreads
away
into
a
fringe
of
trees
*NL*
against
the
sky
with
the
grey
ghost
of
a
bloom
upon
them
;
not
only
is
*NL*
it
a
still
night
in
gardens
and
in
woods
,
and
on
the
river
where
the
*NL*
water-meadows
are
fresh
and
green
,
and
the
stream
sparkles
on
among
*NL*
pleasant
islands
,
murmuring
weirs
,
and
whispering
rushes
;
not
only
*NL*
does
the
stillness
attend
it
as
it
flows
where
houses
cluster
thick
,
*NL*
where
many
bridges
are
reflected
in
it
,
where
wharves
and
shipping
*NL*
make
it
black
and
awful
,
where
it
winds
from
these
disfigurements
*NL*
through
marshes
whose
grim
beacons
stand
like
skeletons
washed
*NL*
ashore
,
where
it
expands
through
the
bolder
region
of
rising
grounds
,
*NL*
rich
in
cornfield
wind-mill
and
steeple
,
and
where
it
mingles
with
*NL*
the
ever-heaving
sea
;
not
only
is
it
a
still
night
on
the
deep
,
and
*NL*
on
the
shore
where
the
watcher
stands
to
see
the
ship
with
her
spread
*NL*
wings
cross
the
path
of
light
that
appears
to
be
presented
to
only
*NL*
him
;
but
even
on
this
stranger
's
wilderness
of
London
there
is
some
*NL*
rest
.
Its
steeples
and
towers
and
its
one
great
dome
grow
more
*NL*
ethereal
;
its
smoky
house-tops
lose
their
grossness
in
the
pale
*NL*
effulgence
;
the
noises
that
arise
from
the
streets
are
fewer
and
are
*NL*
softened
,
and
the
footsteps
on
the
pavements
pass
more
tranquilly
*NL*
away
.
In
these
fields
of
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
inhabiting
,
where
the
*NL*
shepherds
play
on
Chancery
pipes
that
have
no
stop
,
and
keep
their
*NL*
sheep
in
the
fold
by
hook
and
by
crook
until
they
have
shorn
them
*NL*
exceeding
close
,
every
noise
is
merged
,
this
moonlight
night
,
into
a
*NL*
distant
ringing
hum
,
as
if
the
city
were
a
vast
glass
,
vibrating
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
's
that
?
Who
fired
a
gun
or
pistol
?
Where
was
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
few
foot-passengers
start
,
stop
,
and
stare
about
them
.
Some
*NL*
windows
and
doors
are
opened
,
and
people
come
out
to
look
.
It
was
a
*NL*
loud
report
and
echoed
and
rattled
heavily
.
It
shook
one
house
,
or
so
*NL*
a
man
says
who
was
passing
.
It
has
aroused
all
the
dogs
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
who
bark
vehemently
.
Terrified
cats
scamper
across
the
*NL*
road
.
While
the
dogs
are
yet
barking
and
howling
--
there
is
one
dog
*NL*
howling
like
a
demon
--
the
church-clocks
,
as
if
they
were
startled
*NL*
too
,
begin
to
strike
.
The
hum
from
the
streets
,
likewise
,
seems
to
*NL*
swell
into
a
shout
.
But
it
is
soon
over
.
Before
the
last
clock
begins
*NL*
to
strike
ten
,
there
is
a
lull
.
When
it
has
ceased
,
the
fine
night
,
*NL*
the
bright
large
moon
,
and
multitudes
of
stars
,
are
left
at
peace
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Has
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
been
disturbed
?
His
windows
are
dark
and
quiet
,
*NL*
and
his
door
is
shut
.
It
must
be
something
unusual
indeed
to
bring
*NL*
him
out
of
his
shell
.
Nothing
is
heard
of
him
,
nothing
is
seen
of
*NL*
him
.
What
power
of
cannon
might
it
take
to
shake
that
rusty
old
man
*NL*
out
of
his
immovable
composure
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
years
the
persistent
Roman
has
been
pointing
,
with
no
*NL*
particular
meaning
,
from
that
ceiling
.
It
is
not
likely
that
he
has
*NL*
any
new
meaning
in
him
to-night
.
Once
pointing
,
always
pointing
--
like
*NL*
any
Roman
,
or
even
Briton
,
with
a
single
idea
.
There
he
is
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
in
his
impossible
attitude
,
pointing
,
unavailingly
,
all
night
long
.
*NL*
Moonlight
,
darkness
,
dawn
,
sunrise
,
day
.
There
he
is
still
,
eagerly
*NL*
pointing
,
and
no
one
minds
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
little
after
the
coming
of
the
day
come
people
to
clean
the
*NL*
rooms
.
And
either
the
Roman
has
some
new
meaning
in
him
,
not
*NL*
expressed
before
,
or
the
foremost
of
them
goes
wild
,
for
looking
up
*NL*
at
his
outstretched
hand
and
looking
down
at
what
is
below
it
,
that
*NL*
person
shrieks
and
flies
.
The
others
,
looking
in
as
the
first
one
*NL*
looked
,
shriek
and
fly
too
,
and
there
is
an
alarm
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
does
it
mean
?
No
light
is
admitted
into
the
darkened
chamber
,
*NL*
and
people
unaccustomed
to
it
enter
,
and
treading
softly
but
heavily
,
*NL*
carry
a
weight
into
the
bedroom
and
lay
it
down
.
There
is
whispering
*NL*
and
wondering
all
day
,
strict
search
of
every
corner
,
careful
tracing
*NL*
of
steps
,
and
careful
noting
of
the
disposition
of
every
article
of
*NL*
furniture
.
All
eyes
look
up
at
the
Roman
,
and
all
voices
murmur
,
``
If
*NL*
he
could
only
tell
what
he
saw
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
pointing
at
a
table
with
a
bottle
-LRB-
nearly
full
of
wine
-RRB-
and
a
*NL*
glass
upon
it
and
two
candles
that
were
blown
out
suddenly
soon
after
*NL*
being
lighted
.
He
is
pointing
at
an
empty
chair
and
at
a
stain
upon
*NL*
the
ground
before
it
that
might
be
almost
covered
with
a
hand
.
These
*NL*
objects
lie
directly
within
his
range
.
An
excited
imagination
might
*NL*
suppose
that
there
was
something
in
them
so
terrific
as
to
drive
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
composition
,
not
only
the
attendant
big-legged
boys
,
but
*NL*
the
clouds
and
flowers
and
pillars
too
--
in
short
,
the
very
body
and
*NL*
soul
of
Allegory
,
and
all
the
brains
it
has
--
stark
mad
.
It
happens
*NL*
surely
that
every
one
who
comes
into
the
darkened
room
and
looks
at
*NL*
these
things
looks
up
at
the
Roman
and
that
he
is
invested
in
all
*NL*
eyes
with
mystery
and
awe
,
as
if
he
were
a
paralysed
dumb
witness
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
shall
happen
surely
,
through
many
years
to
come
,
that
ghostly
*NL*
stories
shall
be
told
of
the
stain
upon
the
floor
,
so
easy
to
be
*NL*
covered
,
so
hard
to
be
got
out
,
and
that
the
Roman
,
pointing
from
the
*NL*
ceiling
shall
point
,
so
long
as
dust
and
damp
and
spiders
spare
him
,
*NL*
with
far
greater
significance
than
he
ever
had
in
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
*NL*
time
,
and
with
a
deadly
meaning
.
For
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
's
time
is
over
*NL*
for
evermore
,
and
the
Roman
pointed
at
the
murderous
hand
uplifted
*NL*
against
his
life
,
and
pointed
helplessly
at
him
,
from
night
to
*NL*
morning
,
lying
face
downward
on
the
floor
,
shot
through
the
heart
.

CHAPTER
XLIX
*NL*
*NL*
Dutiful
Friendship
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
annual
occasion
has
come
round
in
the
establishment
of
Mr.
*NL*
Matthew
Bagnet
,
otherwise
Lignum
Vitae
,
ex-artilleryman
and
present
*NL*
bassoon-player
.
An
occasion
of
feasting
and
festival
.
The
celebration
*NL*
of
a
birthday
in
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
Mr.
Bagnet
's
birthday
.
Mr.
Bagnet
merely
distinguishes
that
*NL*
epoch
in
the
musical
instrument
business
by
kissing
the
children
with
*NL*
an
extra
smack
before
breakfast
,
smoking
an
additional
pipe
after
*NL*
dinner
,
and
wondering
towards
evening
what
his
poor
old
mother
is
*NL*
thinking
about
it
--
a
subject
of
infinite
speculation
,
and
rendered
so
*NL*
by
his
mother
having
departed
this
life
twenty
years
.
Some
men
rarely
*NL*
revert
to
their
father
,
but
seem
,
in
the
bank-books
of
their
*NL*
remembrance
,
to
have
transferred
all
the
stock
of
filial
affection
*NL*
into
their
mother
's
name
.
Mr.
Bagnet
is
one
of
these
.
Perhaps
his
*NL*
exalted
appreciation
of
the
merits
of
the
old
girl
causes
him
usually
*NL*
to
make
the
noun-substantive
``
goodness
''
of
the
feminine
gender
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
the
birthday
of
one
of
the
three
children
.
Those
occasions
*NL*
are
kept
with
some
marks
of
distinction
,
but
they
rarely
overleap
the
*NL*
bounds
of
happy
returns
and
a
pudding
.
On
young
Woolwich
's
last
*NL*
birthday
,
Mr.
Bagnet
certainly
did
,
after
observing
on
his
growth
and
*NL*
general
advancement
,
proceed
,
in
a
moment
of
profound
reflection
on
*NL*
the
changes
wrought
by
time
,
to
examine
him
in
the
catechism
,
*NL*
accomplishing
with
extreme
accuracy
the
questions
number
one
and
two
,
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
and
``
Who
gave
you
that
name
?
''
but
there
failing
*NL*
in
the
exact
precision
of
his
memory
and
substituting
for
number
*NL*
three
the
question
``
And
how
do
you
like
that
name
?
''
which
he
*NL*
propounded
with
a
sense
of
its
importance
,
in
itself
so
edifying
and
*NL*
improving
as
to
give
it
quite
an
orthodox
air
.
This
,
however
,
was
a
*NL*
speciality
on
that
particular
birthday
,
and
not
a
general
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
old
girl
's
birthday
,
and
that
is
the
greatest
holiday
and
*NL*
reddest-letter
day
in
Mr.
Bagnet
's
calendar
.
The
auspicious
event
is
*NL*
always
commemorated
according
to
certain
forms
settled
and
prescribed
*NL*
by
Mr.
Bagnet
some
years
since
.
Mr.
Bagnet
,
being
deeply
convinced
*NL*
that
to
have
a
pair
of
fowls
for
dinner
is
to
attain
the
highest
*NL*
pitch
of
imperial
luxury
,
invariably
goes
forth
himself
very
early
in
*NL*
the
morning
of
this
day
to
buy
a
pair
;
he
is
,
as
invariably
,
taken
in
*NL*
by
the
vendor
and
installed
in
the
possession
of
the
oldest
*NL*
inhabitants
of
any
coop
in
Europe
.
Returning
with
these
triumphs
of
*NL*
toughness
tied
up
in
a
clean
blue
and
white
cotton
handkerchief
*NL*
-LRB-
essential
to
the
arrangements
-RRB-
,
he
in
a
casual
manner
invites
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
to
declare
at
breakfast
what
she
would
like
for
dinner
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
,
by
a
coincidence
never
known
to
fail
,
replying
fowls
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bagnet
instantly
produces
his
bundle
from
a
place
of
concealment
*NL*
amidst
general
amazement
and
rejoicing
.
He
further
requires
that
the
*NL*
old
girl
shall
do
nothing
all
day
long
but
sit
in
her
very
best
gown
*NL*
and
be
served
by
himself
and
the
young
people
.
As
he
is
not
*NL*
illustrious
for
his
cookery
,
this
may
be
supposed
to
be
a
matter
of
*NL*
state
rather
than
enjoyment
on
the
old
girl
's
part
,
but
she
keeps
her
*NL*
state
with
all
imaginable
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
present
birthday
,
Mr.
Bagnet
has
accomplished
the
usual
*NL*
preliminaries
.
He
has
bought
two
specimens
of
poultry
,
which
,
if
*NL*
there
be
any
truth
in
adages
,
were
certainly
not
caught
with
chaff
,
*NL*
to
be
prepared
for
the
spit
;
he
has
amazed
and
rejoiced
the
family
by
*NL*
their
unlooked-for
production
;
he
is
himself
directing
the
roasting
*NL*
of
the
poultry
;
and
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
with
her
wholesome
brown
fingers
*NL*
itching
to
prevent
what
she
sees
going
wrong
,
sits
in
her
gown
of
*NL*
ceremony
,
an
honoured
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quebec
and
Malta
lay
the
cloth
for
dinner
,
while
Woolwich
,
serving
,
*NL*
as
beseems
him
,
under
his
father
,
keeps
the
fowls
revolving
.
To
these
*NL*
young
scullions
Mrs.
Bagnet
occasionally
imparts
a
wink
,
or
a
shake
*NL*
of
the
head
,
or
a
crooked
face
,
as
they
made
mistakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
half
after
one
.
''
Says
Mr.
Bagnet
.
``
To
the
minute
.
They
'll
be
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
with
anguish
,
beholds
one
of
them
at
a
standstill
before
*NL*
the
fire
and
beginning
to
burn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
a
dinner
,
old
girl
,
''
says
Mr.
Bagnet
.
``
Fit
for
a
*NL*
queen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
shows
her
white
teeth
cheerfully
,
but
to
the
perception
*NL*
of
her
son
,
betrays
so
much
uneasiness
of
spirit
that
he
is
impelled
*NL*
by
the
dictates
of
affection
to
ask
her
,
with
his
eyes
,
what
is
the
*NL*
matter
,
thus
standing
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
,
more
oblivious
of
the
*NL*
fowls
than
before
,
and
not
affording
the
least
hope
of
a
return
to
*NL*
consciousness
.
Fortunately
his
elder
sister
perceives
the
cause
of
*NL*
the
agitation
in
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
breast
and
with
an
admonitory
poke
*NL*
recalls
him
.
The
stopped
fowls
going
round
again
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
closes
*NL*
her
eyes
in
the
intensity
of
her
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
will
look
us
up
,
''
says
Mr.
Bagnet
.
``
At
half
after
four
.
To
*NL*
the
moment
.
How
many
years
,
old
girl
.
Has
George
looked
us
up
.
This
*NL*
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Lignum
,
Lignum
,
as
many
as
make
an
old
woman
of
a
young
one
,
I
*NL*
begin
to
think
.
Just
about
that
,
and
no
less
,
''
returns
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
*NL*
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
girl
,
''
says
Mr.
Bagnet
,
``
never
mind
.
You
'd
be
as
young
as
ever
*NL*
you
was
.
If
you
was
n't
younger
.
Which
you
are
.
As
everybody
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quebec
and
Malta
here
exclaim
,
with
clapping
of
hands
,
that
Bluffy
is
*NL*
sure
to
bring
mother
something
,
and
begin
to
speculate
on
what
it
*NL*
will
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Lignum
,
''
says
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
casting
a
glance
on
the
*NL*
table-cloth
,
and
winking
``
salt
!
''
at
Malta
with
her
right
eye
,
and
*NL*
shaking
the
pepper
away
from
Quebec
with
her
head
,
``
I
begin
to
think
*NL*
George
is
in
the
roving
way
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
''
returns
Mr.
Bagnet
,
``
will
never
desert
.
And
leave
his
old
*NL*
comrade
.
In
the
lurch
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Lignum
.
No
.
I
do
n't
say
he
will
.
I
do
n't
think
he
will
.
But
if
*NL*
he
could
get
over
this
money
trouble
of
his
,
I
believe
he
would
be
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
asks
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returns
his
wife
,
considering
,
``
George
seems
to
me
to
be
*NL*
getting
not
a
little
impatient
and
restless
.
I
do
n't
say
but
what
*NL*
he
's
as
free
as
ever
.
Of
course
he
must
be
free
or
he
would
n't
be
*NL*
George
,
but
he
smarts
and
seems
put
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
extra-drilled
,
''
says
Mr.
Bagnet
.
``
By
a
lawyer
.
Who
would
put
*NL*
the
devil
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
in
that
,
''
his
wife
assents
;
``
but
so
it
is
,
*NL*
Lignum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Further
conversation
is
prevented
,
for
the
time
,
by
the
necessity
*NL*
under
which
Mr.
Bagnet
finds
himself
of
directing
the
whole
force
of
*NL*
his
mind
to
the
dinner
,
which
is
a
little
endangered
by
the
dry
*NL*
humour
of
the
fowls
in
not
yielding
any
gravy
,
and
also
by
the
made
*NL*
gravy
acquiring
no
flavour
and
turning
out
of
a
flaxen
complexion
.
*NL*
With
a
similar
perverseness
,
the
potatoes
crumble
off
forks
in
the
*NL*
process
of
peeling
,
upheaving
from
their
centres
in
every
direction
,
*NL*
as
if
they
were
subject
to
earthquakes
.
The
legs
of
the
fowls
,
too
,
*NL*
are
longer
than
could
be
desired
,
and
extremely
scaly
.
Overcoming
*NL*
these
disadvantages
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
Mr.
Bagnet
at
last
*NL*
dishes
and
they
sit
down
at
table
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
occupying
the
guest
's
*NL*
place
at
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
well
for
the
old
girl
that
she
has
but
one
birthday
in
a
year
,
*NL*
for
two
such
indulgences
in
poultry
might
be
injurious
.
Every
kind
of
*NL*
finer
tendon
and
ligament
that
is
in
the
nature
of
poultry
to
possess
*NL*
is
developed
in
these
specimens
in
the
singular
form
of
*NL*
guitar-strings
.
Their
limbs
appear
to
have
struck
roots
into
their
*NL*
breasts
and
bodies
,
as
aged
trees
strike
roots
into
the
earth
.
Their
*NL*
legs
are
so
hard
as
to
encourage
the
idea
that
they
must
have
devoted
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
their
long
and
arduous
lives
to
pedestrian
*NL*
exercises
and
the
walking
of
matches
.
But
Mr.
Bagnet
,
unconscious
of
*NL*
these
little
defects
,
sets
his
heart
on
Mrs.
Bagnet
eating
a
most
*NL*
severe
quantity
of
the
delicacies
before
her
;
and
as
that
good
old
*NL*
girl
would
not
cause
him
a
moment
's
disappointment
on
any
day
,
least
*NL*
of
all
on
such
a
day
,
for
any
consideration
,
she
imperils
her
*NL*
digestion
fearfully
.
How
young
Woolwich
cleans
the
drum-sticks
*NL*
without
being
of
ostrich
descent
,
his
anxious
mother
is
at
a
loss
to
*NL*
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
girl
has
another
trial
to
undergo
after
the
conclusion
of
the
*NL*
repast
in
sitting
in
state
to
see
the
room
cleared
,
the
hearth
swept
,
*NL*
and
the
dinner-service
washed
up
and
polished
in
the
backyard
.
The
*NL*
great
delight
and
energy
with
which
the
two
young
ladies
apply
*NL*
themselves
to
these
duties
,
turning
up
their
skirts
in
imitation
of
*NL*
their
mother
and
skating
in
and
out
on
little
scaffolds
of
pattens
,
*NL*
inspire
the
highest
hopes
for
the
future
,
but
some
anxiety
for
the
*NL*
present
.
The
same
causes
lead
to
confusion
of
tongues
,
a
clattering
*NL*
of
crockery
,
a
rattling
of
tin
mugs
,
a
whisking
of
brooms
,
and
an
*NL*
expenditure
of
water
,
all
in
excess
,
while
the
saturation
of
the
*NL*
young
ladies
themselves
is
almost
too
moving
a
spectacle
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
to
look
upon
with
the
calmness
proper
to
her
position
.
At
last
*NL*
the
various
cleansing
processes
are
triumphantly
completed
;
Quebec
*NL*
and
Malta
appear
in
fresh
attire
,
smiling
and
dry
;
pipes
,
tobacco
,
*NL*
and
something
to
drink
are
placed
upon
the
table
;
and
the
old
girl
*NL*
enjoys
the
first
peace
of
mind
she
ever
knows
on
the
day
of
this
*NL*
delightful
entertainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Bagnet
takes
his
usual
seat
,
the
hands
of
the
clock
are
very
*NL*
near
to
half-past
four
;
as
they
mark
it
accurately
,
Mr.
Bagnet
*NL*
announces
,
``
George
!
Military
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
George
,
and
he
has
hearty
congratulations
for
the
old
girl
*NL*
-LRB-
whom
he
kisses
on
the
great
occasion
-RRB-
,
and
for
the
children
,
and
for
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
.
``
Happy
returns
to
all
!
''
says
Mr.
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
George
,
old
man
!
''
cries
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
looking
at
him
curiously
.
*NL*
``
What
's
come
to
you

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

produces
his
present
,
which
is
greeted
with
admiring

leapings
and
clappings
by
the
young
family
,
and
with
a
species
of
*NL*
reverential
admiration
by
Mr.

.
``
Old

says
Mr.

.
*NL*
``
Tell

Mrs.

Mrs.

turning
it
on
all
sides
*NL*
and
holding
it
out
at
arm

length
,
``
that
it

choice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad

says
Mr.

*NL*

says
*NL*
Mrs.

,
her
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
and
her
hand
stretched
*NL*
out
to
him
;
``

I
have
been
a
crossgrained
soldier

we

strong

I
am
sure

in

fasten

George

*NL*
*NL*
The
children
close
up
to
see
it
done
,
and
Mr.
Bagnet
looks
over
young
*NL*
Woolwich
's
head
to
see
it
done
with
an
interest
so
maturely
wooden
,
*NL*
yet
pleasantly
childish
,
that
Mrs.
Bagnet
can
not
help
laughing
in
her
*NL*
airy
way
and
saying
,
``
Oh
,
Lignum
,
Lignum
,
what
a
precious
old
chap
*NL*
you
are
!
''
But
the
trooper
fails
to
fasten
the
brooch
.
His
hand
*NL*
shakes
,
he
is
nervous
,
and
it
falls
off
.
``
Would
any
one
believe
*NL*
this
?
''
says
he
,
catching
it
as
it
drops
and
looking
round
.
``
I
am
so
*NL*
out
of
sorts
that
I
bungle
at
an
easy
job
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
concludes
that
for
such
a
case
there
is
no
remedy
like
a
*NL*
pipe
,
and
fastening
the
brooch
herself
in
a
twinkling
,
causes
the
*NL*
trooper
to
be
inducted
into
his
usual
snug
place
and
the
pipes
to
be
*NL*
got
into
action
.
``
If
that
do
n't
bring
you
round
,
George
,
''
says
she
,
*NL*
``
just
throw
your
eye
across
here
at
your
present
now

then
,

*NL*
the
two
together
MUST
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
do
it
of
yourself

George
answers
;

I
know
that
very
*NL*
well

Mrs.

I
'll
tell
you
how
,
one
way

another
,
the
blues
*NL*
have
got
to
be
too
many
for
me
.
Here
was
this
poor
lad
.
'T
was
dull
*NL*
work
to
see
him
dying
as
he
did
,
and
not
be
able
to
help
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
George
?
You
did
help
him
.
You
took
him
under
your
*NL*
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
helped
him
so
far
,
but
that
's
little
.
I
mean
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
there
*NL*
he
was
,
dying
without
ever
having
been
taught
much
more
than
to
know
*NL*
his
right
hand
from
his
left
.
And
he
was
too
far
gone
to
be
helped
*NL*
out
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
creetur
!
''
says
Mrs.
Bagnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
not
yet
lighting
his
pipe
,
and
passing
his
*NL*
heavy
hand
over
his
hair
,
``
that
brought
up
Gridley
in
a
man
's
mind
.
*NL*
His
was
a
bad
case
too
,
in
a
different
way
.
Then
the
two
got
mixed
up
*NL*
in
a
man
's
mind
with
a
flinty
old
rascal
who
had
to
do
with
both
.
And
*NL*
to
think
of
that
rusty
carbine
,
stock
and
barrel
,
standing
up
on
end
*NL*
in
his
corner
,
hard
,
indifferent
,
taking
everything
so
evenly
--
it
*NL*
made
flesh
and
blood
tingle
,
I
do
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
advice
to
you
,
''
returns
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
``
is
to
light
your
pipe
and
*NL*
tingle
that
way
.
It
's
wholesomer
and
comfortabler
,
and
better
for
the
*NL*
health
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
``
and
I
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
does
it
,
though
still
with
an
indignant
gravity
that
impresses
*NL*
the
young
Bagnets
,
and
even
causes
Mr.
Bagnet
to
defer
the
ceremony
*NL*
of
drinking
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
health
,
always
given
by
himself
on
these
*NL*
occasions
in
a
speech
of
exemplary
terseness
.
But
the
young
ladies
*NL*
having
composed
what
Mr.
Bagnet
is
in
the
habit
of
calling
``
the
*NL*
mixtur
,
''
and
George
's
pipe
being
now
in
a
glow
,
Mr.
Bagnet
considers
*NL*
it
his
duty
to
proceed
to
the
toast
of
the
evening
.
He
addresses
the
*NL*
assembled
company
in
the
following
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
.
Woolwich
.
Quebec
.
Malta
.
This
is
her
birthday
.
Take
a
day
's
*NL*
march
.
And
you
wo
n't
find
such
another
.
Here
's
towards
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
toast
having
been
drunk
with
enthusiasm
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
returns
*NL*
thanks
in
a
neat
address
of
corresponding
brevity
.
This
model
*NL*
composition
is
limited
to
the
three
words
``
And
wishing
yours
!
''
which
*NL*
the
old
girl
follows
up
with
a
nod
at
everybody
in
succession
and
a
*NL*
well-regulated
swig
of
the
mixture
.
This
she
again
follows
up
,
on
the
*NL*
present
occasion
,
by
the
wholly
unexpected
exclamation
,
``
Here
's
a
*NL*
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
IS
a
man
,
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
little
company
,
*NL*
looking
in
at
the
parlour-door
.
He
is
a
sharp-eyed
man
--
a
quick
keen
*NL*
man
--
and
he
takes
in
everybody
's
look
at
him
,
all
at
once
,
*NL*
individually
and
collectively
,
in
a
manner
that
stamps
him
a
*NL*
remarkable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
''
says
the
man
,
nodding
,
``
how
do
you
find
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
Bucket
!
''
cries
Mr.
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
the
man
,
coming
in
and
closing
the
door
.
``
I
was
going
*NL*
down
the
street
here
when
I
happened
to
stop
and
look
in
at
the
*NL*
musical
instruments
in
the
shop-window
--
a
friend
of
mine
is
in
want
*NL*
of
a
second-hand
wiolinceller
of
a
good
tone
--
and
I
saw
a
party
*NL*
enjoying
themselves
,
and
I
thought
it
was
you
in
the
corner

I
*NL*
thought
I
could
n't
be
mistaken

How
goes
the
world
with

*NL*
at

present
moment

Pretty
smooth

And

you

says
Mr.

,
opening
his
arms
,
``
here

*NL*
children

may
do
anything
with

only
show
me

children

Give
us
a

No
occasion
to
inquire
who
YOUR

father

mother

Never
saw
such
a
likeness
in
my
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
,
not
unwelcome
,
has
sat
himself
down
next
to
Mr.
George
*NL*
and
taken
Quebec
and
Malta
on
his
knees
.
``
You
pretty
dears
,
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
``
give
us
another
kiss

it
's
the
only

'm
greedy
in

Lord
bless
you

how
healthy
you
look

And
what
may
be
the
ages
of
*NL*
these
two

ma'am

I
should
put
'em
down
at
the
figures

about
eight
*NL*
and
ten

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
near

says
Mrs.
Bagnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
generally
am
near

''
returns
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
being
so
fond

still

fresh

rosy
as

Not
so
much

so
as
yourself

upon
my
soul

she
comes
near

And
what

you
call

pursues
Mr.

,
pinching
Malta
's
*NL*
cheeks
.
``
These
are
peaches

are

Bless
your

And
what
do

second-hand
wiolinceller

good
tone

Mr.

friend

my
*NL*
dear

My
name

Bucket

Ai
n't
that
a
funny
name

''
*NL*
*NL*
These
blandishments
have
entirely
won
the
family
heart
.
Mrs.
Bagnet
*NL*
forgets
the
day
to
the
extent
of
filling
a
pipe
and
a
glass
for
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
and
waiting
upon
him
hospitably
.
She
would
be
glad
to
receive
*NL*
so
pleasant
a
character
under
any
circumstances
,
but
she
tells
him
*NL*
that
as
a
friend
of
George
's
she
is
particularly
glad
to
see
him
this
*NL*
evening
,
for
George
has
not
been
in
his
usual
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
his
usual
spirits

''
exclaims
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Why
,
I
never
heard
*NL*
of
such
a

What
's
the
matter

What

of

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

returns
the
trooper

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should

not

rejoins
Mr.

``
What
could
you
have
on
*NL*
your
mind

know

And

these
pets
got
anything

Not
they

but
they
'll
be
upon

minds
of
some
of

young

fellows

some
of
these
days

and
make

precious
low-spirited

I
*NL*
ai
n't
much
of
a
prophet

but
I
can
tell
you
that
,
ma'am

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
quite
charmed
,
hopes
Mr.
Bucket
has
a
family
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
ma'am
!

says
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Would
you
believe
it

No

I
*NL*
have

My

Mrs.
Bucket
is
as
*NL*
fond
of
children
as
myself
and
as
wishful
to
have
'em
,
but
no
.
So
it
*NL*
is
.
Worldly
goods
are
divided
unequally
,
and
man
must
not
repine
.
*NL*
What
a
very
nice
backyard
,
ma'am
!
Any
way
out
of
that
yard
,
now

*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
way
out
of
that
yard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
there
really

Mr.

I
should

No

there

no

But
what
a

good-proportioned
yard
it

*NL*
*NL*
Having
cast
his
sharp
eye
all
about
it
,
Mr.
Bucket
returns
to
his
*NL*
chair
next
his
friend
Mr.
George
and
pats
Mr.
George
affectionately
*NL*
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How

All

returns
the

Mr.

*NL*
Somewhat
harping
on
this
phrase
,
considering
the
extent
and
variety
*NL*
of
his
conversational
powers
,
Mr.
Bucket
twice
or
thrice
repeats
it
*NL*
to
the
pipe
he
lights
,
and
with
a
listening
face
that
is
particularly
*NL*
his
own
.
But
the
sun
of
his
sociality
soon
recovers
from
this
brief
*NL*
eclipse
and
shines
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
brother
,
is
it
,
my
dears
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
referring
to
*NL*
Quebec
and
Malta
for
information
on
the
subject
of
young
Woolwich
.
*NL*
``
And
a
nice
brother
he
is
--
half-brother
I
mean
to
say
.
For
he
's
too
*NL*
old
to
be
your
boy
,
ma'am

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
certify
at
all

is

returns
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
do
surprise
me
!
Yet
he
's
like
you
,
there
's
no
denying

*NL*
Lord
,
he
's
wonderfully
like

But
about
what
you
may
call
the
*NL*
brow
,
you
know

THERE
his
father
comes
out

''
Mr.
Bucket
compares
the
*NL*
faces
with
one
eye
shut
up
,
while
Mr.
Bagnet
smokes
in
stolid
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
an
opportunity
for
Mrs.
Bagnet
to
inform
him
that
the
boy
is
*NL*
George
's
godson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
's
godson
,
is
he
?
''
rejoins
Mr.
Bucket
with
extreme
cordiality
.
*NL*
``
I
must
shake
hands
over
again
with
George
's
godson
.
Godfather
and
*NL*
godson
do
credit
to
one
another
.
And
what
do
you
intend
to
make
of
*NL*
him
,
ma'am
?
Does
he
show
any
turn
for
any
musical
instrument
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
suddenly
interposes
,
``
Plays
the
fife
.
Beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
,
governor
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
struck
by
the
*NL*
coincidence
,
``
that
when
I
was
a
boy
I
played
the
fife
myself
?
Not
in
*NL*
a
scientific
way
,
as
I
expect
he
does
,
but
by
ear
.
Lord
bless
you
!
*NL*
`
British
Grenadiers
'
--
there
's
a
tune
to
warm
an
Englishman
up
!
COULD
*NL*
you
give
us
`
British
Grenadiers
,
'
my
fine
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
acceptable
to
the
little
circle
than
this
call
*NL*
upon
young
Woolwich
,
who
immediately
fetches
his
fife
and
performs
*NL*
the
stirring
melody
,
during
which
performance
Mr.
Bucket
,
much
*NL*
enlivened
,
beats
time
and
never
fails
to
come
in
sharp
with
the
*NL*
burden
,
``
British
Gra-a-anadeers
!
''
In
short
,
he
shows
so
much
musical
*NL*
taste
that
Mr.
Bagnet
actually
takes
his
pipe
from
his
lips
to
*NL*
express
his
conviction
that
he
is
a
singer
.
Mr.
Bucket
receives
the
*NL*
harmonious
impeachment
so
modestly
,
confessing
how
that
he
did
once
*NL*
chaunt
a
little
,
for
the
expression
of
the
feelings
of
his
own
bosom
,
*NL*
and
with
no
presumptuous
idea
of
entertaining
his
friends
,
that
he
is
*NL*
asked
to
sing
.
Not
to
be
behindhand
in
the
sociality
of
the
evening
,
*NL*
he
complies
and
gives
them
``
Believe
Me
,
if
All
Those
Endearing
Young
*NL*
Charms
.
''
This
ballad
,
he
informs
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
he
considers
to
have
*NL*
been
his
most
powerful
ally
in
moving
the
heart
of
Mrs.
Bucket
when
a
*NL*
maiden
,
and
inducing
her
to
approach
the
altar
--
Mr.
Bucket
's
own
*NL*
words
are
``
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sparkling
stranger
is
such
a
new
and
agreeable
feature
in
the
*NL*
evening
that
Mr.
George
,
who
testified
no
great
emotions
of
pleasure
*NL*
on
his
entrance
,
begins
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
be
rather
proud
of
*NL*
him
.
He
is
so
friendly
,
is
a
man
of
so
many
resources
,
and
so
easy
to
*NL*
get
on
with
,
that
it
is
something
to
have
made
him
known
there
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bagnet
becomes
,
after
another
pipe
,
so
sensible
of
the
value
of
his
*NL*
acquaintance
that
he
solicits
the
honour
of
his
company
on
the
old
*NL*
girl
's
next
birthday
.
If
anything
can
more
closely
cement
and
*NL*
consolidate
the
esteem
which
Mr.
Bucket
has
formed
for
the
family
,
it
*NL*
is
the
discovery
of
the
nature
of
the
occasion
.
He
drinks
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
with
a
warmth
approaching
to
rapture
,
engages
himself
for
that
*NL*
day
twelvemonth
more
than
thankfully
,
makes
a
memorandum
of
the
day
*NL*
in
a
large
black
pocket-book
with
a
girdle
to
it
,
and
breathes
a
hope
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Bucket
and
Mrs.
Bagnet
may
before
then
become
,
in
a
manner
,
*NL*
sisters
.
As
he
says
himself
,
what
is
public
life
without
private
*NL*
ties
?
He
is
in
his
humble
way
a
public
man
,
but
it
is
not
in
that
*NL*
sphere
that
he
finds
happiness
.
No
,
it
must
be
sought
within
the
*NL*
confines
of
domestic
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
natural
,
under
these
circumstances
,
that
he
,
in
his
turn
,
*NL*
should
remember
the
friend
to
whom
he
is
indebted
for
so
promising
an
*NL*
acquaintance
.
And
he
does
.
He
keeps
very
close
to
him
.
Whatever
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
conversation
,
he
keeps
a
tender
eye
upon
him
.
He
waits
*NL*
to
walk
home
with
him
.
He
is
interested
in
his
very
boots
and
*NL*
observes
even
them
attentively
as
Mr.
George
sits
smoking
*NL*
cross-legged
in
the
chimney-corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Mr.
George
rises
to
depart
.
At
the
same
moment
Mr.
Bucket
,
*NL*
with
the
secret
sympathy
of
friendship
,
also
rises
.
He
dotes
upon
the
*NL*
children
to
the
last
and
remembers
the
commission
he
has
undertaken
*NL*
for
an
absent
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Respecting
that
second-hand
wiolinceller
,
governor
--
could
you
*NL*
recommend
me
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scores
,
''
says
Mr.
Bagnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
''
returns
Mr.
Bucket
,
squeezing
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
You
're
a
friend
in
need
.
A
good
tone
,
mind
you
!
My
friend
is
a
*NL*
regular
dab
at
it
.
Ecod
,
he
saws
away
at
Mozart
and
Handel
and
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
big-wigs
like
a
thorough
workman
.
And
you
need
n't
,
''
says
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
in
a
considerate
and
private
voice
,
``
you
need
n't
commit
*NL*
yourself
to
too
low
a
figure
,
governor
.
I
do
n't
want
to
pay
too
large
*NL*
a
price
for
my
friend
,
but
I
want
you
to
have
your
proper
percentage
*NL*
and
be
remunerated
for
your
loss
of
time
.
That
is
but
fair
.
Every
man
*NL*
must
live
,
and
ought
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
shakes
his
head
at
the
old
girl
to
the
effect
that
they
*NL*
have
found
a
jewel
of
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
I
was
to
give
you
a
look
in
,
say
,
at
half
arter
ten
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
Perhaps
you
could
name
the
figures
of
a
few
*NL*
wiolincellers
of
a
good
tone
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
easier
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bagnet
both
engage
to
have
the
requisite
*NL*
information
ready
and
even
hint
to
each
other
at
the
practicability
*NL*
of
having
a
small
stock
collected
there
for
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
thank
you
.
Good
night
,
ma'am
.
Good
*NL*
night
,
governor
.
Good
night
,
darlings
.
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
*NL*
one
of
the
pleasantest
evenings
I
ever
spent
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
,
on
the
contrary
,
are
much
obliged
to
him
for
the
pleasure
he
*NL*
has
given
them
in
his
company
;
and
so
they
part
with
many
expressions
*NL*
of
goodwill
on
both
sides
.
``
Now
George
,
old
boy
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
*NL*
taking
his
arm
at
the
shop-door
,
``
come
along
!
''
As
they
go
down
the
*NL*
little
street
and
the
Bagnets
pause
for
a
minute
looking
after
them
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
remarks
to
the
worthy
Lignum
that
Mr.
Bucket
``
almost
*NL*
clings
to
George
like
,
and
seems
to
be
really
fond
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbouring
streets
being
narrow
and
ill-paved
,
it
is
a
little
*NL*
inconvenient
to
walk
there
two
abreast
and
arm
in
arm
.
Mr.
George
*NL*
therefore
soon
proposes
to
walk
singly
.
But
Mr.
Bucket
,
who
can
not
*NL*
make
up
his
mind
to
relinquish
his
friendly
hold
,
replies
,
``
Wait
half
*NL*
a
minute
,
George
.
I
should
wish
to
speak
to
you
first
.
''
Immediately
*NL*
afterwards
,
he
twists
him
into
a
public-house
and
into
a
parlour
,
*NL*
where
he
confronts
him
and
claps
his
own
back
against
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

George
,

says
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
duty
is
duty

it

I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make

pleasant
to-night

and
I
put
it
to

the

thunderstruck

*NL*
``

Mr.

urging
a

with
his

forefinger

*NL*
The

sinks
upon
a
seat
behind
him

and
great
drops
start
out
*NL*
upon
his
forehead
,
and
a
deadly
pallor
overspreads
his
face

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

up

With

manner

as
if

up

he
takes

wish
to
make
things
as
pleasant
as
*NL*
is
consistent
with
my
duty
,
and
I
've
got
another
pair
in
my
pocket
.
''
*NL*
This
remark
he
offers
like
a
most
respectable
tradesman
anxious
to
*NL*
execute
an
order
neatly
and
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
his
*NL*
customer
.
``
They
'll
do
as
they
are
?
Very
well
!
Now
,
you
see
,
*NL*
George
''
--
he
takes
a
cloak
from
a
corner
and
begins
adjusting
it
about
*NL*
the
trooper
's
neck
--
``
I
was
mindful
of
your
feelings
when
I
come
out
,
*NL*
and
brought
this
on
purpose
.
There
!
Who
's
the
wiser
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
I
,
''
returns
the
trooper
,
``
but
as
I
know
it
,
do
me
one
more
good
*NL*
turn
and
pull
my
hat
over
my
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
though
!
Do
you
mean
it
?
Ai
n't
it
a
pity
?
It
looks
so
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
look
chance
men
in
the
face
with
these
things
on

''
Mr.
*NL*
George
hurriedly
replies
.
``
Do
,
for
God
's
sake
,
pull
my
hat
forward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
strongly
entreated
,
Mr.
Bucket
complies
,
puts
his
own
hat
on
,
and
*NL*
conducts
his
prize
into
the
streets
,
the
trooper
marching
on
as
*NL*
steadily
as
usual
,
though
with
his
head
less
erect
,
and
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
steering
him
with
his
elbow
over
the
crossings
and
up
the
turnings

CHAPTER
L
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
when
I
came
home
from
Deal
I
found
a
note
from
Caddy
*NL*
Jellyby
-LRB-
as
we
always
continued
to
call
her
-RRB-
,
informing
me
that
her
*NL*
health
,
which
had
been
for
some
time
very
delicate
,
was
worse
and
*NL*
that
she
would
be
more
glad
than
she
could
tell
me
if
I
would
go
to
*NL*
see
her
.
It
was
a
note
of
a
few
lines
,
written
from
the
couch
on
*NL*
which
she
lay
and
enclosed
to
me
in
another
from
her
husband
,
in
*NL*
which
he
seconded
her
entreaty
with
much
solicitude
.
Caddy
was
now
*NL*
the
mother
,
and
I
the
godmother
,
of
such
a
poor
little
baby
--
such
a
*NL*
tiny
old-faced
mite
,
with
a
countenance
that
seemed
to
be
scarcely
*NL*
anything
but
cap-border
,
and
a
little
lean
,
long-fingered
hand
,
*NL*
always
clenched
under
its
chin
.
It
would
lie
in
this
attitude
all
*NL*
day
,
with
its
bright
specks
of
eyes
open
,
wondering
-LRB-
as
I
used
to
*NL*
imagine
-RRB-
how
it
came
to
be
so
small
and
weak
.
Whenever
it
was
moved
*NL*
it
cried
,
but
at
all
other
times
it
was
so
patient
that
the
sole
*NL*
desire
of
its
life
appeared
to
be
to
lie
quiet
and
think
.
It
had
*NL*
curious
little
dark
veins
in
its
face
and
curious
little
dark
marks
*NL*
under
its
eyes
like
faint
remembrances
of
poor
Caddy
's
inky
days
,
and
*NL*
altogether
,
to
those
who
were
not
used
to
it
,
it
was
quite
a
piteous
*NL*
little
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
enough
for
Caddy
that
SHE
was
used
to
it
.
The
projects
*NL*
with
which
she
beguiled
her
illness
,
for
little
Esther
's
education
,
*NL*
and
little
Esther
's
marriage
,
and
even
for
her
own
old
age
as
the
*NL*
grandmother
of
little
Esther
's
little
Esthers
,
was
so
prettily
*NL*
expressive
of
devotion
to
this
pride
of
her
life
that
I
should
be
*NL*
tempted
to
recall
some
of
them
but
for
the
timely
remembrance
that
I
*NL*
am
getting
on
irregularly
as
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
return
to
the
letter
.
Caddy
had
a
superstition
about
me
which
had
*NL*
been
strengthening
in
her
mind
ever
since
that
night
long
ago
when
*NL*
she
had
lain
asleep
with
her
head
in
my
lap
.
She
almost
--
I
think
I
*NL*
must
say
quite
--
believed
that
I
did
her
good
whenever
I
was
near
her
.
*NL*
Now
although
this
was
such
a
fancy
of
the
affectionate
girl
's
that
I
*NL*
am
almost
ashamed
to
mention
it
,
still
it
might
have
all
the
force
of
*NL*
a
fact
when
she
was
really
ill
.
Therefore
I
set
off
to
Caddy
,
with
my
*NL*
guardian
's
consent
,
post-haste
;
and
she
and
Prince
made
so
much
of
me
*NL*
that
there
never
was
anything
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
I
went
again
to
sit
with
her
,
and
next
day
I
went
again
.
It
*NL*
was
a
very
easy
journey
,
for
I
had
only
to
rise
a
little
earlier
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
and
keep
my
accounts
,
and
attend
to
housekeeping
matters
*NL*
before
leaving
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
had
made
these
three
visits
,
my
guardian
said
to
me
,
on
my
*NL*
return
at
night
,
``
Now
,
little
woman
,
little
woman
,
this
will
never
*NL*
do
.
Constant
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
,
and
constant
coaching
*NL*
will
wear
out
a
Dame
Durden
.
We
will
go
to
London
for
a
while
and
*NL*
take
possession
of
our
old
lodgings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
me
,
dear
guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
I
never
feel
tired
,
''
which
*NL*
was
strictly
true
.
I
was
only
too
happy
to
be
in
such
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
then
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
``
or
for
Ada
,
or
for
both
of
us
.
*NL*
It
is
somebody
's
birthday
to-morrow
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
I
think
it
is
,
''
said
I
,
kissing
my
darling
,
who
would
be
*NL*
twenty-one
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
observed
my
guardian
,
half
pleasantly
,
half
seriously
,
*NL*
``
that
's
a
great
occasion
and
will
give
my
fair
cousin
some
necessary
*NL*
business
to
transact
in
assertion
of
her
independence
,
and
will
make
*NL*
London
a
more
convenient
place
for
all
of
us
.
So
to
London
we
will
*NL*
go
.
That
being
settled
,
there
is
another
thing
--
how
have
you
left
*NL*
Caddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
unwell
,
guardian
.
I
fear
it
will
be
some
time
before
she
*NL*
regains
her
health
and
strength
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
some
time
,
now
?
''
asked
my
guardian
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
weeks
,
I
am
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
He
began
to
walk
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
showing
that
he
had
been
thinking
as
much
.
``
Now
,
what
do
you
say
*NL*
about
her
doctor
?
Is
he
a
good
doctor
,
my
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
obliged
to
confess
that
I
knew
nothing
to
the
contrary
but
*NL*
that
Prince
and
I
had
agreed
only
that
evening
that
we
would
like
his
*NL*
opinion
to
be
confirmed
by
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
''
returned
my
guardian
quickly
,
``
there
's
Woodcourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
meant
that
,
and
was
rather
taken
by
surprise
.
For
a
moment
*NL*
all
that
I
had
had
in
my
mind
in
connexion
with
Mr.
Woodcourt
seemed
*NL*
to
come
back
and
confuse
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
object
to
him
,
little
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Object
to
him
,
guardian
?
Oh
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
think
the
patient
would
object
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
from
that
,
I
had
no
doubt
of
her
being
prepared
to
have
a
*NL*
great
reliance
on
him
and
to
like
him
very
much
.
I
said
that
he
was
*NL*
no
stranger
to
her
personally
,
for
she
had
seen
him
often
in
his
kind
*NL*
attendance
on
Miss
Flite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
He
has
been
here
to-day
,
my
dear
,
and
*NL*
I
will
see
him
about
it
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
in
this
short
conversation
--
though
I
did
not
know
how
,
for
she
*NL*
was
quiet
,
and
we
interchanged
no
look
--
that
my
dear
girl
well
*NL*
remembered
how
merrily
she
had
clasped
me
round
the
waist
when
no
*NL*
other
hands
than
Caddy
's
had
brought
me
the
little
parting
token
.
*NL*
This
caused
me
to
feel
that
I
ought
to
tell
her
,
and
Caddy
too
,
that
*NL*
I
was
going
to
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
and
that
if
I
avoided
*NL*
that
disclosure
any
longer
I
might
become
less
worthy
in
my
own
eyes
*NL*
of
its
master
's
love
.
Therefore
,
when
we
went
upstairs
and
had
waited
*NL*
listening
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
in
order
that
only
I
might
be
*NL*
the
first
to
wish
my
darling
all
good
wishes
on
her
birthday
and
to
*NL*
take
her
to
my
heart
,
I
set
before
her
,
just
as
I
had
set
before
*NL*
myself
,
the
goodness
and
honour
of
her
cousin
John
and
the
happy
life
*NL*
that
was
in
store
for
me
.
If
ever
my
darling
were
fonder
of
me
at
*NL*
one
time
than
another
in
all
our
intercourse
,
she
was
surely
fondest
*NL*
of
me
that
night
.
And
I
was
so
rejoiced
to
know
it
and
so
comforted
*NL*
by
the
sense
of
having
done
right
in
casting
this
last
idle
*NL*
reservation
away
that
I
was
ten
times
happier
than
I
had
been
before
.
*NL*
I
had
scarcely
thought
it
a
reservation
a
few
hours
ago
,
but
now
that
*NL*
it
was
gone
I
felt
as
if
I
understood
its
nature
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
we
went
to
London
.
We
found
our
old
lodging
vacant
,
and
in
*NL*
half
an
hour
were
quietly
established
there
,
as
if
we
had
never
gone
*NL*
away
.
Mr.
Woodcourt
dined
with
us
to
celebrate
my
darling
's
birthday
,
*NL*
and
we
were
as
pleasant
as
we
could
be
with
the
great
blank
among
us
*NL*
that
Richard
's
absence
naturally
made
on
such
an
occasion
.
After
that
*NL*
day
I
was
for
some
weeks
--
eight
or
nine
as
I
remember
--
very
much
with
*NL*
Caddy
,
and
thus
it
fell
out
that
I
saw
less
of
Ada
at
this
time
than
*NL*
any
other
since
we
had
first
come
together
,
except
the
time
of
my
own
*NL*
illness
.
She
often
came
to
Caddy
's
,
but
our
function
there
was
to
*NL*
amuse
and
cheer
her
,
and
we
did
not
talk
in
our
usual
confidential
*NL*
manner
.
Whenever
I
went
home
at
night
we
were
together
,
but
Caddy
's
*NL*
rest
was
broken
by
pain
,
and
I
often
remained
to
nurse
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
husband
and
her
poor
little
mite
of
a
baby
to
love
and
their
*NL*
home
to
strive
for
,
what
a
good
creature
Caddy
was
!
So
self-denying
,
*NL*
so
uncomplaining
,
so
anxious
to
get
well
on
their
account
,
so
afraid
*NL*
of
giving
trouble
,
and
so
thoughtful
of
the
unassisted
labours
of
her
*NL*
husband
and
the
comforts
of
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
;
I
had
never
known
the
*NL*
best
of
her
until
now
.
And
it
seemed
so
curious
that
her
pale
face
*NL*
and
helpless
figure
should
be
lying
there
day
after
day
where
dancing
*NL*
was
the
business
of
life
,
where
the
kit
and
the
apprentices
began
*NL*
early
every
morning
in
the
ball-room
,
and
where
the
untidy
little
boy
*NL*
waltzed
by
himself
in
the
kitchen
all
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Caddy
's
request
I
took
the
supreme
direction
of
her
apartment
,
*NL*
trimmed
it
up
,
and
pushed
her
,
couch
and
all
,
into
a
lighter
and
more
*NL*
airy
and
more
cheerful
corner
than
she
had
yet
occupied
;
then
,
every
*NL*
day
,
when
we
were
in
our
neatest
array
,
I
used
to
lay
my
small
small
*NL*
namesake
in
her
arms
and
sit
down
to
chat
or
work
or
read
to
her
.
It
*NL*
was
at
one
of
the
first
of
these
quiet
times
that
I
told
Caddy
about
*NL*
Bleak
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
other
visitors
besides
Ada
.
First
of
all
we
had
Prince
,
who
in
*NL*
his
hurried
intervals
of
teaching
used
to
come
softly
in
and
sit
*NL*
softly
down
,
with
a
face
of
loving
anxiety
for
Caddy
and
the
very
*NL*
little
child
.
Whatever
Caddy
's
condition
really
was
,
she
never
failed
*NL*
to
declare
to
Prince
that
she
was
all
but
well
--
which
I
,
heaven
*NL*
forgive
me
,
never
failed
to
confirm
.
This
would
put
Prince
in
such
*NL*
good
spirits
that
he
would
sometimes
take
the
kit
from
his
pocket
and
*NL*
play
a
chord
or
two
to
astonish
the
baby
,
which
I
never
knew
it
to
do
*NL*
in
the
least
degree
,
for
my
tiny
namesake
never
noticed
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
Mrs.
Jellyby
.
She
would
come
occasionally
,
with
her
*NL*
usual
distraught
manner
,
and
sit
calmly
looking
miles
beyond
her
*NL*
grandchild
as
if
her
attention
were
absorbed
by
a
young
Borrioboolan
*NL*
on
its
native
shores
.
As
bright-eyed
as
ever
,
as
serene
,
and
as
*NL*
untidy
,
she
would
say
,
``
Well
,
Caddy
,
child
,
and
how
do
you
do
*NL*
to-day
?
''
And
then
would
sit
amiably
smiling
and
taking
no
notice
of
*NL*
the
reply
or
would
sweetly
glide
off
into
a
calculation
of
the
number
*NL*
of
letters
she
had
lately
received
and
answered
or
of
the
*NL*
coffee-bearing
power
of
Borrioboola-Gha
.
This
she
would
always
do
*NL*
with
a
serene
contempt
for
our
limited
sphere
of
action
,
not
to
be
*NL*
disguised
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
who
was
from
morning
to
night
and
*NL*
from
night
to
morning
the
subject
of
innumerable
precautions
.
If
the
*NL*
baby
cried
,
it
was
nearly
stifled
lest
the
noise
should
make
him
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
If
the
fire
wanted
stirring
in
the
night
,
it
was
*NL*
surreptitiously
done
lest
his
rest
should
be
broken
.
If
Caddy
*NL*
required
any
little
comfort
that
the
house
contained
,
she
first
*NL*
carefully
discussed
whether
he
was
likely
to
require
it
too
.
In
*NL*
return
for
this
consideration
he
would
come
into
the
room
once
a
day
,
*NL*
all
but
blessing
it
--
showing
a
condescension
,
and
a
patronage
,
and
a
*NL*
grace
of
manner
in
dispensing
the
light
of
his
high-shouldered
*NL*
presence
from
which
I
might
have
supposed
him
-LRB-
if
I
had
not
known
*NL*
better
-RRB-
to
have
been
the
benefactor
of
Caddy
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Caroline
,
''
he
would
say
,
making
the
nearest
approach
that
he
*NL*
could
to
bending
over
her
.
``
Tell
me
that
you
are
better
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
much
better
,
thank
you
,
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
''
Caddy
would
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
!
Enchanted
!
And
our
dear
Miss
Summerson
.
She
is
not
quite
*NL*
prostrated
by
fatigue
?
''
Here
he
would
crease
up
his
eyelids
and
kiss
*NL*
his
fingers
to
me
,
though
I
am
happy
to
say
he
had
ceased
to
be
*NL*
particular
in
his
attentions
since
I
had
been
so
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
I
would
assure
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
!
We
must
take
care
of
our
dear
Caroline
,
Miss
Summerson
.
We
*NL*
must
spare
nothing
that
will
restore
her
.
We
must
nourish
her
.
My
*NL*
dear
Caroline
''
--
he
would
turn
to
his
daughter-in-law
with
infinite
*NL*
generosity
and
protection
--
``
want
for
nothing
,
my
love
.
Frame
a
wish
*NL*
and
gratify
it
,
my
daughter
.
Everything
this
house
contains
,
*NL*
everything
my
room
contains
,
is
at
your
service
,
my
dear
.
Do
not
,
''
he
*NL*
would
sometimes
add
in
a
burst
of
deportment
,
``
even
allow
my
simple
*NL*
requirements
to
be
considered
if
they
should
at
any
time
interfere
*NL*
with
your
own
,
my
Caroline
.
Your
necessities
are
greater
than
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
established
such
a
long
prescriptive
right
to
this
deportment
*NL*
-LRB-
his
son
's
inheritance
from
his
mother
-RRB-
that
I
several
times
knew
*NL*
both
Caddy
and
her
husband
to
be
melted
to
tears
by
these
*NL*
affectionate
self-sacrifices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
my
dears
,
''
he
would
remonstrate
;
and
when
I
saw
Caddy
's
thin
*NL*
arm
about
his
fat
neck
as
he
said
it
,
I
would
be
melted
too
,
though
*NL*
not
by
the
same
process
.
``
Nay
,
nay
!
I
have
promised
never
to
leave
*NL*
ye
.
Be
dutiful
and
affectionate
towards
me
,
and
I
ask
no
other
*NL*
return
.
Now
,
bless
ye
!
I
am
going
to
the
Park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
take
the
air
there
presently
and
get
an
appetite
for
his
*NL*
hotel
dinner
.
I
hope
I
do
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
no
wrong
,
but
I
never
*NL*
saw
any
better
traits
in
him
than
these
I
faithfully
record
,
except
*NL*
that
he
certainly
conceived
a
liking
for
Peepy
and
would
take
the
*NL*
child
out
walking
with
great
pomp
,
always
on
those
occasions
sending
*NL*
him
home
before
he
went
to
dinner
himself
,
and
occasionally
with
a
*NL*
halfpenny
in
his
pocket
.
But
even
this
disinterestedness
was
attended
*NL*
with
no
inconsiderable
cost
,
to
my
knowledge
,
for
before
Peepy
was
*NL*
sufficiently
decorated
to
walk
hand
in
hand
with
the
professor
of
*NL*
deportment
,
he
had
to
be
newly
dressed
,
at
the
expense
of
Caddy
and
*NL*
her
husband
,
from
top
to
toe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
of
our
visitors
,
there
was
Mr.
Jellyby
.
Really
when
he
used
to
*NL*
come
in
of
an
evening
,
and
ask
Caddy
in
his
meek
voice
how
she
was
,
*NL*
and
then
sit
down
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
and
make
no
attempt
*NL*
to
say
anything
more
,
I
liked
him
very
much
.
If
he
found
me
bustling
*NL*
about
doing
any
little
thing
,
he
sometimes
half
took
his
coat
off
,
as
*NL*
if
with
an
intention
of
helping
by
a
great
exertion
;
but
he
never
got
*NL*
any
further
.
His
sole
occupation
was
to
sit
with
his
head
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
looking
hard
at
the
thoughtful
baby
;
and
I
could
not
quite
*NL*
divest
my
mind
of
a
fancy
that
they
understood
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
counted
Mr.
Woodcourt
among
our
visitors
because
he
was
*NL*
now
Caddy
's
regular
attendant
.
She
soon
began
to
improve
under
his
*NL*
care
,
but
he
was
so
gentle
,
so
skilful
,
so
unwearying
in
the
pains
he
*NL*
took
that
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
I
am
sure
.
I
saw
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
Mr.
Woodcourt
during
this
time
,
though
not
so
much
as
might
be
*NL*
supposed
,
for
knowing
Caddy
to
be
safe
in
his
hands
,
I
often
slipped
*NL*
home
at
about
the
hours
when
he
was
expected
.
We
frequently
met
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
.
I
was
quite
reconciled
to
myself
now
,
but
I
still
*NL*
felt
glad
to
think
that
he
was
sorry
for
me
,
and
he
still
WAS
sorry
*NL*
for
me
I
believed
.
He
helped
Mr.
Badger
in
his
professional
*NL*
engagements
,
which
were
numerous
,
and
had
as
yet
no
settled
projects
*NL*
for
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
when
Caddy
began
to
recover
that
I
began
to
notice
a
change
in
*NL*
my
dear
girl
.
I
can
not
say
how
it
first
presented
itself
to
me
,
*NL*
because
I
observed
it
in
many
slight
particulars
which
were
nothing
*NL*
in
themselves
and
only
became
something
when
they
were
pieced
*NL*
together
.
But
I
made
it
out
,
by
putting
them
together
,
that
Ada
was
*NL*
not
so
frankly
cheerful
with
me
as
she
used
to
be
.
Her
tenderness
for
*NL*
me
was
as
loving
and
true
as
ever
;
I
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
;
*NL*
but
there
was
a
quiet
sorrow
about
her
which
she
did
not
confide
to
*NL*
me
,
and
in
which
I
traced
some
hidden
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
could
not
understand
this
,
and
I
was
so
anxious
for
the
*NL*
happiness
of
my
own
pet
that
it
caused
me
some
uneasiness
and
set
me
*NL*
thinking
often
.
At
length
,
feeling
sure
that
Ada
suppressed
this
*NL*
something
from
me
lest
it
should
make
me
unhappy
too
,
it
came
into
my
*NL*
head
that
she
was
a
little
grieved
--
for
me
--
by
what
I
had
told
her
*NL*
about
Bleak
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
I
persuaded
myself
that
this
was
likely
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
had
no
*NL*
idea
that
there
was
any
selfish
reference
in
my
doing
so
.
I
was
not
*NL*
grieved
for
myself
:
I
was
quite
contented
and
quite
happy
.
Still
,
*NL*
that
Ada
might
be
thinking
--
for
me
,
though
I
had
abandoned
all
such
*NL*
thoughts
--
of
what
once
was
,
but
was
now
all
changed
,
seemed
so
easy
*NL*
to
believe
that
I
believed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
do
to
reassure
my
darling
-LRB-
I
considered
then
-RRB-
and
show
*NL*
her
that
I
had
no
such
feelings
?
Well
!
I
could
only
be
as
brisk
and
*NL*
busy
as
possible
,
and
that
I
had
tried
to
be
all
along
.
However
,
as
*NL*
Caddy
's
illness
had
certainly
interfered
,
more
or
less
,
with
my
home
*NL*
duties
--
though
I
had
always
been
there
in
the
morning
to
make
my
*NL*
guardian
's
breakfast
,
and
he
had
a
hundred
times
laughed
and
said
*NL*
there
must
be
two
little
women
,
for
his
little
woman
was
never
*NL*
missing
--
I
resolved
to
be
doubly
diligent
and
gay
.
So
I
went
about
*NL*
the
house
humming
all
the
tunes
I
knew
,
and
I
sat
working
and
working
*NL*
in
a
desperate
manner
,
and
I
talked
and
talked
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
there
was
the
same
shade
between
me
and
my
darling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Dame
Trot
,
''
observed
my
guardian
,
shutting
up
his
book
one
night
*NL*
when
we
were
all
three
together
,
``
so
Woodcourt
has
restored
Caddy
*NL*
Jellyby
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
life
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
;
``
and
to
be
repaid
by
such
gratitude
as
hers
is
to
be
*NL*
made
rich
,
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
was
,
''
he
returned
,
``
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
did
I
too
,
for
that
matter
.
I
said
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
We
would
make
him
as
rich
as
a
Jew
if
we
knew
how
.
Would
we
*NL*
not
,
little
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughed
as
I
worked
and
replied
that
I
was
not
sure
about
that
,
for
*NL*
it
might
spoil
him
,
and
he
might
not
be
so
useful
,
and
there
might
be
*NL*
many
who
could
ill
spare
him
.
As
Miss
Flite
,
and
Caddy
herself
,
and
*NL*
many
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
I
had
forgotten
that
.
But
we
would
agree
*NL*
to
make
him
rich
enough
to
live
,
I
suppose
?
Rich
enough
to
work
with
*NL*
tolerable
peace
of
mind
?
Rich
enough
to
have
his
own
happy
home
and
*NL*
his
own
household
gods
--
and
household
goddess
,
too
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
quite
another
thing
,
I
said
.
We
must
all
agree
in
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
All
of
us
.
I
have
a
great
regard
for
*NL*
Woodcourt
,
a
high
esteem
for
him
;
and
I
have
been
sounding
him
*NL*
delicately
about
his
plans
.
It
is
difficult
to
offer
aid
to
an
*NL*
independent
man
with
that
just
kind
of
pride
which
he
possesses
.
And
*NL*
yet
I
would
be
glad
to
do
it
if
I
might
or
if
I
knew
how
.
He
seems
*NL*
half
inclined
for
another
voyage
.
But
that
appears
like
casting
such
*NL*
a
man
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
open
a
new
world
to
him
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
might
,
little
woman
,
''
my
guardian
assented
.
``
I
doubt
if
he
*NL*
expects
much
of
the
old
world
.
Do
you
know
I
have
fancied
that
he
*NL*
sometimes
feels
some
particular
disappointment
or
misfortune
*NL*
encountered
in
it
.
You
never
heard
of
anything
of
that
sort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
I
am
mistaken
,
I
dare
say
.
''
As
there
was
*NL*
a
little
pause
here
,
which
I
thought
,
for
my
dear
girl
's
*NL*
satisfaction
,
had
better
be
filled
up
,
I
hummed
an
air
as
I
worked
*NL*
which
was
a
favourite
with
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
think
Mr.
Woodcourt
will
make
another
voyage
?
''
I
asked
*NL*
him
when
I
had
hummed
it
quietly
all
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
know
what
to
think
,
my
dear
,
but
I
should
say
it
was
*NL*
likely
at
present
that
he
will
give
a
long
trip
to
another
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
he
will
take
the
best
wishes
of
all
our
hearts
with
him
*NL*
wherever
he
goes
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
though
they
are
not
riches
,
he
will
*NL*
never
be
the
poorer
for
them
,
guardian
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
little
woman
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sitting
in
my
usual
place
,
which
was
now
beside
my
guardian
's
*NL*
chair
.
That
had
not
been
my
usual
place
before
the
letter
,
but
it
was
*NL*
now
.
I
looked
up
to
Ada
,
who
was
sitting
opposite
,
and
I
saw
,
as
she
*NL*
looked
at
me
,
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
that
tears
*NL*
were
falling
down
her
face
.
I
felt
that
I
had
only
to
be
placid
and
*NL*
merry
once
for
all
to
undeceive
my
dear
and
set
her
loving
heart
at
*NL*
rest
.
I
really
was
so
,
and
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
made
my
sweet
girl
lean
upon
my
shoulder
--
how
little
thinking
*NL*
what
was
heavy
on
her
mind
!
--
and
I
said
she
was
not
quite
well
,
and
*NL*
put
my
arm
about
her
,
and
took
her
upstairs
.
When
we
were
in
our
own
*NL*
room
,
and
when
she
might
perhaps
have
told
me
what
I
was
so
*NL*
unprepared
to
hear
,
I
gave
her
no
encouragement
to
confide
in
me
;
I
*NL*
never
thought
she
stood
in
need
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
good
Esther
,
''
said
Ada
,
``
if
I
could
only
make
up
my
mind
*NL*
to
speak
to
you
and
my
cousin
John
when
you
are
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
love
!
''
I
remonstrated
.
``
Ada
,
why
should
you
not
speak
to
*NL*
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
only
dropped
her
head
and
pressed
me
closer
to
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
surely
do
n't
forget
,
my
beauty
,
''
said
I
,
smiling
,
``
what
quiet
,
*NL*
old-fashioned
people
we
are
and
how
I
have
settled
down
to
be
the
*NL*
discreetest
of
dames
?
You
do
n't
forget
how
happily
and
peacefully
my
*NL*
life
is
all
marked
out
for
me
,
and
by
whom
?
I
am
certain
that
you
*NL*
do
n't
forget
by
what
a
noble
character
,
Ada
.
That
can
never
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
never

Esther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I
,
``
there
can
be
nothing
amiss
--
and
why
*NL*
should
you
not
speak
to
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
amiss
,
Esther
?
''
returned
Ada
.
``
Oh
,
when
I
think
of
all
these
*NL*
years
,
and
of
his
fatherly
care
and
kindness

and
of
the
old
*NL*
relations
among

,
and
of
you
,
what
shall
I
do
,
what
shall
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
my
child
in
some
wonder
,
but
I
thought
it
better
not
to
*NL*
answer
otherwise
than
by
cheering
her
,
and
so
I
turned
off
into
many
*NL*
little
recollections
of
our
life
together
and
prevented
her
from
*NL*
saying
more
.
When
she
lay
down
to
sleep
,
and
not
before
,
I
returned
*NL*
to
my
guardian
to
say
good
night
,
and
then
I
came
back
to
Ada
and
sat
*NL*
near
her
for
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
asleep
,
and
I
thought
as
I
looked
at
her
that
she
was
a
*NL*
little
changed
.
I
had
thought
so
more
than
once
lately
.
I
could
not
*NL*
decide
,
even
looking
at
her
while
she
was
unconscious
,
how
she
was
*NL*
changed
,
but
something
in
the
familiar
beauty
of
her
face
looked
*NL*
different
to
me
.
My
guardian
's
old
hopes
of
her
and
Richard
arose
*NL*
sorrowfully
in
my
mind
,
and
I
said
to
myself
,
``
She
has
been
anxious
*NL*
about
him
,
''
and
I
wondered
how
that
love
would
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
come
home
from
Caddy
's
while
she
was
ill
,
I
had
often
*NL*
found
Ada
at
work
,
and
she
had
always
put
her
work
away
,
and
I
had
*NL*
never
known
what
it
was
.
Some
of
it
now
lay
in
a
drawer
near
her
,
*NL*
which
was
not
quite
closed
.
I
did
not
open
the
drawer
,
but
I
still
*NL*
rather
wondered
what
the
work
could
be
,
for
it
was
evidently
nothing
*NL*
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
noticed
as
I
kissed
my
dear
that
she
lay
with
one
hand
under
*NL*
her
pillow
so
that
it
was
hidden
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
much
less
amiable
I
must
have
been
than
they
thought
me
,
how
much
*NL*
less
amiable
than
I
thought
myself
,
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
my
own
*NL*
cheerfulness
and
contentment
as
to
think
that
it
only
rested
with
me
*NL*
to
put
my
dear
girl
right
and
set
her
mind
at
peace
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
lay
down
,
self-deceived
,
in
that
belief
.
And
I
awoke
in
it
next
*NL*
day
to
find
that
there
was
still
the
same
shade
between
me
and
my
*NL*
darling
.

CHAPTER
LI
*NL*
*NL*
Enlightened
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Woodcourt
arrived
in
London
,
he
went
,
that
very
same
day
,
to
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
's
in
Symond
's
Inn
.
For
he
never
once
,
from
the
moment
when
*NL*
I
entreated
him
to
be
a
friend
to
Richard
,
neglected
or
forgot
his
*NL*
promise
.
He
had
told
me
that
he
accepted
the
charge
as
a
sacred
*NL*
trust
,
and
he
was
ever
true
to
it
in
that
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Mr.
Vholes
in
his
office
and
informed
Mr.
Vholes
of
his
*NL*
agreement
with
Richard
that
he
should
call
there
to
learn
his
*NL*
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
.
``
Mr.
C.
's
address
is
not
a
hundred
*NL*
miles
from
here
,
sir
,
Mr.
C.
's
address
is
not
a
hundred
miles
from
*NL*
here
.
Would
you
take
a
seat
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
thanked
Mr.
Vholes
,
but
he
had
no
business
with
him
*NL*
beyond
what
he
had
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
sir
.
I
believe
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
,
still
quietly
*NL*
insisting
on
the
seat
by
not
giving
the
address
,
``
that
you
have
*NL*
influence
with
Mr.
C.
Indeed
I
am
aware
that
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
,
''
returned
Mr.
Woodcourt
;
``
but
I
*NL*
suppose
you
know
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
rejoined
Mr.
Vholes
,
self-contained
as
usual
,
voice
and
all
,
*NL*
``
it
is
a
part
of
my
professional
duty
to
know
best
.
It
is
a
part
of
*NL*
my
professional
duty
to
study
and
to
understand
a
gentleman
who
*NL*
confides
his
interests
to
me
.
In
my
professional
duty
I
shall
not
be
*NL*
wanting
,
sir
,
if
I
know
it
.
I
may
,
with
the
best
intentions
,
be
*NL*
wanting
in
it
without
knowing
it
;
but
not
if
I
know
it
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
again
mentioned
the
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
leave
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
.
``
Bear
with
me
for
a
moment

*NL*
Sir
,
Mr.
C.
is
playing
for
a
considerable
stake

can
not
play
*NL*
without

need

what

*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
,
I
presume

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
said
Mr.
Vholes
,
``

be
honest
with
you

my

golden

I

I

the

Now
,

upon
the
chances

I
express
to
you
no

NO

It

impolitic
in
Mr.

,
after
playing
so
long

so
high

to
leave
off
;
*NL*
it
might
be
the
reverse

I
say
nothing

No

said
Mr.
Vholes
,
*NL*
bringing
his
hand
flat
down
upon
his
desk
in
a
positive
manner
,
*NL*
``
nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
forget

returned
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
``
that
I
ask
you

say

nothing

have
no
interest
in
anything
you
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me

retorted
Mr.

.
``
You

yourself
an

No

You

You
are
interested

everything

relates

I
know
human
nature
much

better

sir
,
than
to
admit
for
an

that
a

of
your
*NL*
appearance
is
not
interested

whatever
concerns
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
``
that
may
be
.
I
am
particularly
*NL*
interested
in
his
address

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
number
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Vholes
parenthetically
,
``
I
believe
I
have
*NL*
already
mentioned
.
If
Mr.
C.
is
to
continue
to
play
for
this
*NL*
considerable
stake
,
sir
,
he
must
have
funds
.
Understand
me
!
There
are
*NL*
funds
in
hand
at
present

I
ask
for
nothing
;
there
are
funds
in
hand

*NL*
But
for
the
onward
play
,
more
funds
must
be
provided
,
unless
Mr.
C.
*NL*
is
to
throw
away
what
he
has
already
ventured
,
which
is
wholly
and
*NL*
solely
a
point
for
his
consideration

This
,
sir
,
I
take
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
stating
openly
to
you
as
the
friend
of
Mr.

Without
*NL*
funds
I
shall
always
be
happy
to
appear

extent

I
could
not
go

wronging

I
must
either
wrong
my

is
entirely
dependent

me

in
the
Vale

Taunton

*NL*
some

my
resolution

folly

if
you
please

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
rather
sternly
rejoined
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish

said
Mr.
Vholes

``

Therefore

take

Mr.

My

painted

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
returned
Mr.
Vholes
,
``
as
I
believe
I
have
already
mentioned

*NL*
it
is
next
door

On
the
second
story
you
will
find
Mr.
C.
's
*NL*
apartments
.
Mr.
C.
desires
to
be
near
his
professional
adviser
,
and
I
*NL*
am
far
from
objecting
,
for
I
court
inquiry

''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
Mr.
Woodcourt
wished
Mr.
Vholes
good
day
and
went
in
search
*NL*
of
Richard
,
the
change
in
whose
appearance
he
began
to
understand
now
*NL*
but
too
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
him
in
a
dull
room
,
fadedly
furnished
,
much
as
I
had
found
*NL*
him
in
his
barrack-room
but
a
little
while
before
,
except
that
he
was
*NL*
not
writing
but
was
sitting
with
a
book
before
him
,
from
which
his
*NL*
eyes
and
thoughts
were
far
astray
.
As
the
door
chanced
to
be
standing
*NL*
open
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
was
in
his
presence
for
some
moments
without
*NL*
being
perceived
,
and
he
told
me
that
he
never
could
forget
the
*NL*
haggardness
of
his
face
and
the
dejection
of
his
manner
before
he
was
*NL*
aroused
from
his
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woodcourt
,
my
dear
fellow

''
cried
Richard
,
starting
up
with
extended
*NL*
hands
,
``
you
come
upon
my
vision
like
a
ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friendly
one
,
''
he
replied
,
``
and
only
waiting
,
as
they
say
ghosts
*NL*
do

to
be
addressed

How
does
the
mortal
world
go
?
''
They
were
seated
*NL*
now
,
near
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Badly
enough
,
and
slowly
enough
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
speaking
at
least
*NL*
for
my
part
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
part
is
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

shaking
his
head

``

going
well
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I

said
Richard
moodily
.
``
Who
ever
did
?
''
He
brightened
again
in
*NL*
a
moment
and
said
with
his
natural
openness
,
``
Woodcourt
,
I
should
be
*NL*
sorry
to
be
misunderstood
by
you
,
even
if
I
gained
by
it

your
*NL*
estimation

You
must
know
that
I
have
done
no
good
this
long
time
.
I
*NL*
have
not
intended
to
do
much
harm
,
but
I
seem
to
have
been
capable
of
*NL*
nothing
else

It
may
be
that
I
should
have
done
better
by
keeping
out
*NL*
of
the
net
into
which
my
destiny
has
worked
me

but
I
think
not
,
*NL*
though
I
dare
say
you
will
soon
hear
,
if
you
have
not
already
heard
,
*NL*
a
very
different
opinion
.
To
make
short
of
a
long
story
,
I
am
afraid
*NL*
I
have
wanted
an
object
;
but
I
have
an
object
now
--
or
it
has
me
--
and
*NL*
it
is
too
late
to
discuss
it
.
Take
me
as
I
am
,
and
make
the
best
of
*NL*
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bargain
,

said
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
``
Do
as
much
by
me
in
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
,
''
returned
Richard
,
``
you
can
pursue
your
art
for
its
own
*NL*
sake
,
and
can
put
your
hand
upon
the
plough
and
never
turn
,
and
can
*NL*
strike
a
purpose
out
of
anything
.
You
and
I
are
very
different
*NL*
creatures

*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
regretfully
and
lapsed
for
a
moment
into
his
weary
*NL*
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
he
cried
,
shaking
it
off
.
``
Everything
has
an
end

We
*NL*
shall
see

So
you
will
take
me
as

the
best
of
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
Indeed
I
will

''
They
shook
hands
upon
it
laughingly
,
but
in
*NL*
deep
earnestness
.
I
can
answer
for
one
of
them
with
my
heart
of
*NL*
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
as
a
godsend

said
Richard
,
``
for
I
have
seen
nobody
here
*NL*
yet
but
Vholes

Woodcourt

there
is
one
subject
I
should
like
to
*NL*
mention
,
for
once
and
for
all
,
in
the
beginning
of
our
treaty
.
You
*NL*
can
hardly
make
the
best
of
me
if
I
do
n't

You
know

I
dare
say
,
that
*NL*
I
have
an
attachment
to
my
cousin
Ada
?

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
replied
that
I
had
hinted
as
much
to
him
.
``
Now
pray
,
''
*NL*
returned
Richard
,
``
do
n't
think
me
a
heap
of
selfishness

Do
n't
*NL*
suppose
that
I
am
splitting
my
head
and
half
breaking
my
heart
over
*NL*
this
miserable
Chancery
suit
for
my
own
rights

interests
alone

*NL*
Ada

Do
think

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
very
solicitous
on
this
head
that
Mr.
Woodcourt
gave
him
*NL*
the
strongest
assurances
that
he
did
him
no
injustice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Richard
,
with
something
pathetic
in
his
manner
of
*NL*
lingering
on
the
point
,
though
it
was
off-hand
and
unstudied
,
``
to
an
*NL*
upright
fellow

bringing
a
friendly
face

yours
here

I
*NL*

not
bear
the
thought
of
appearing
selfish
and
mean

I
want
to
see
*NL*
Ada
righted

Woodcourt
,
as
well
as
myself

I
want
to
do
my
utmost
to

right
her

as
well

I
venture
what
I
can
scrape
together
to
*NL*
extricate
her
,
as
well
as
myself
.
Do
,
I
beseech
you
,
think
of
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
,
when
Mr.
Woodcourt
came
to
reflect
on
what
had
passed
,
he
*NL*
was
so
very
much
impressed
by
the
strength
of
Richard
's
anxiety
on
*NL*
this
point
that
in
telling
me
generally
of
his
first
visit
to
*NL*
Symond
's
Inn
he
particularly
dwelt
upon
it
.
It
revived
a
fear
I
had
*NL*
had
before
that
my
dear
girl
's
little
property
would
be
absorbed
by
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
and
that
Richard
's
justification
to
himself
would
be
*NL*
sincerely
this
.
It
was
just
as
I
began
to
take
care
of
Caddy
that
the
*NL*
interview
took
place
,
and
I
now
return
to
the
time
when
Caddy
had
*NL*
recovered
and
the
shade
was
still
between
me
and
my
darling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
proposed
to
Ada
that
morning
that
we
should
go
and
see
Richard
.
It
*NL*
a
little
surprised
me
to
find
that
she
hesitated
and
was
not
so
*NL*
radiantly
willing
as
I
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
have
not
had
any
difference
with
Richard
*NL*
since
I
have
been
so
much
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Esther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
heard
of
him
,
perhaps
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
heard
of
him
,
''
said
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
such
love
in
her
face
.
I
could
not
make
*NL*
my
darling
out
.
Should
I
go
to
Richard
's
by
myself
?
I
said
.
No
,
Ada
*NL*
thought
I
had
better
not
go
by
myself
.
Would
she
go
with
me
?
Yes
,
Ada
*NL*
thought
she
had
better
go
with
me
.
Should
we
go
now
?
Yes
,
let
us
go
*NL*
now
.
Well
,
I
could
not
understand
my
darling
,
with
the
tears
in
her
*NL*
eyes
and
the
love
in
her
face
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
soon
equipped
and
went
out
.
It
was
a
sombre
day
,
and
drops
of
*NL*
chill
rain
fell
at
intervals
.
It
was
one
of
those
colourless
days
*NL*
when
everything
looks
heavy
and
harsh
.
The
houses
frowned
at
us
,
the
*NL*
dust
rose
at
us
,
the
smoke
swooped
at
us
,
nothing
made
any
compromise
*NL*
about
itself
or
wore
a
softened
aspect
.
I
fancied
my
beautiful
girl
*NL*
quite
out
of
place
in
the
rugged
streets
,
and
I
thought
there
were
*NL*
more
funerals
passing
along
the
dismal
pavements
than
I
had
ever
seen
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
first
to
find
out
Symond
's
Inn
.
We
were
going
to
inquire
in
a
*NL*
shop
when
Ada
said
she
thought
it
was
near
Chancery
Lane
.
``
We
are
not
*NL*
likely
to
be
far
out
,
my
love
,
if
we
go
in
that
direction
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
So
to
Chancery
Lane
we
went
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
we
saw
it
*NL*
written
up
.
Symond
's
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
next
to
find
out
the
number
.
``
Or
Mr.
Vholes
's
office
will
do
,
''
*NL*
I
recollected
,
``
for
Mr.
Vholes
's
office
is
next
door
.
''
Upon
which
Ada
*NL*
said
,
perhaps
that
was
Mr.
Vholes
's
office
in
the
corner
there
.
And
*NL*
it
really
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
question
,
which
of
the
two
next
doors
?
I
was
going
for
*NL*
the
one
,
and
my
darling
was
going
for
the
other
;
and
my
darling
was
*NL*
right
again
.
So
up
we
went
to
the
second
story
,
when
we
came
to
*NL*
Richard
's
name
in
great
white
letters
on
a
hearse-like
panel
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
knocked
,
but
Ada
said
perhaps
we
had
better
turn
the
*NL*
handle
and
go
in
.
Thus
we
came
to
Richard
,
poring
over
a
table
*NL*
covered
with
dusty
bundles
of
papers
which
seemed
to
me
like
dusty
*NL*
mirrors
reflecting
his
own
mind
.
Wherever
I
looked
I
saw
the
ominous
*NL*
words
that
ran
in
it
repeated
.
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
us
very
affectionately
,
and
we
sat
down
.
``
If
you
had
come
*NL*
a
little
earlier
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
would
have
found
Woodcourt
here
.
*NL*
There
never
was
such
a
good
fellow
as
Woodcourt
is
.
He
finds
time
to
*NL*
look
in
between-whiles
,
when
anybody
else
with
half
his
work
to
do
*NL*
would
be
thinking
about
not
being
able
to
come
.
And
he
is
so
cheery
,
*NL*
so
fresh
,
so
sensible
,
so
earnest
,
so
--
everything
that
I
am
not
,
that
*NL*
the
place
brightens
whenever
he
comes
,
and
darkens
whenever
he
goes
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
him
,
''
I
thought
,
``
for
his
truth
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
so
sanguine
,
Ada
,
''
continued
Richard
,
casting
his
dejected
*NL*
look
over
the
bundles
of
papers
,
``
as
Vholes
and
I
are
usually
,
but
he
*NL*
is
only
an
outsider
and
is
not
in
the
mysteries
.
We
have
gone
into
*NL*
them
,
and
he
has
not
.
He
ca
n't
be
expected
to
know
much
of
such
a
*NL*
labyrinth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
look
wandered
over
the
papers
again
and
he
passed
his
two
*NL*
hands
over
his
head
,
I
noticed
how
sunken
and
how
large
his
eyes
*NL*
appeared
,
how
dry
his
lips
were
,
and
how
his
finger-nails
were
all
*NL*
bitten
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
a
healthy
place
to
live
in
,
Richard
,
do
you
think
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
Minerva
,
''
answered
Richard
with
his
old
gay
laugh
,
``
it
*NL*
is
neither
a
rural
nor
a
cheerful
place
;
and
when
the
sun
shines
*NL*
here
,
you
may
lay
a
pretty
heavy
wager
that
it
is
shining
brightly
in
*NL*
an
open
spot
.
But
it
's
well
enough
for
the
time
.
It
's
near
the
*NL*
offices
and
near
Vholes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
I
hinted
,
``
a
change
from
both
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
do
me
good
?
''
said
Richard
,
forcing
a
laugh
as
he
finished
the
*NL*
sentence
.
``
I
should
n't
wonder
!
But
it
can
only
come
in
one
way
*NL*
now
--
in
one
of
two
ways
,
I
should
rather
say
.
Either
the
suit
must
be
*NL*
ended
,
Esther
,
or
the
suitor
.
But
it
shall
be
the
suit
,
my
dear
girl
,
*NL*
the
suit
,
my
dear
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
latter
words
were
addressed
to
Ada
,
who
was
sitting
nearest
to
*NL*
him
.
Her
face
being
turned
away
from
me
and
towards
him
,
I
could
not
*NL*
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
doing
very
well
,
''
pursued
Richard
.
``
Vholes
will
tell
you
so
.
*NL*
We
are
really
spinning
along
.
Ask
Vholes
.
We
are
giving
them
no
rest
.
*NL*
Vholes
knows
all
their
windings
and
turnings
,
and
we
are
upon
them
*NL*
everywhere
.
We
have
astonished
them
already
.
We
shall
rouse
up
that
*NL*
nest
of
sleepers
,
mark
my
words
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hopefulness
had
long
been
more
painful
to
me
than
his
*NL*
despondency
;
it
was
so
unlike
hopefulness
,
had
something
so
fierce
in
*NL*
its
determination
to
be
it
,
was
so
hungry
and
eager
,
and
yet
so
*NL*
conscious
of
being
forced
and
unsustainable
that
it
had
long
touched
*NL*
me
to
the
heart
.
But
the
commentary
upon
it
now
indelibly
written
in
*NL*
his
handsome
face
made
it
far
more
distressing
than
it
used
to
be
.
I
*NL*
say
indelibly
,
for
I
felt
persuaded
that
if
the
fatal
cause
could
*NL*
have
been
for
ever
terminated
,
according
to
his
brightest
visions
,
in
*NL*
that
same
hour
,
the
traces
of
the
premature
anxiety
,
self-reproach
,
*NL*
and
disappointment
it
had
occasioned
him
would
have
remained
upon
his
*NL*
features
to
the
hour
of
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sight
of
our
dear
little
woman
,
''
said
Richard
,
Ada
still
*NL*
remaining
silent
and
quiet
,
``
is
so
natural
to
me
,
and
her
*NL*
compassionate
face
is
so
like
the
face
of
old
days
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
No
,
no
.
I
smiled
and
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
So
exactly
like
the
face
of
old
days
,
''
said
Richard
in
his
cordial
*NL*
voice
,
and
taking
my
hand
with
the
brotherly
regard
which
nothing
*NL*
ever
changed
,
``
that
I
ca
n't
make
pretences
with
her
.
I
fluctuate
a
*NL*
little
;
that
's
the
truth
.
Sometimes
I
hope
,
my
dear
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
I
--
do
n't
quite
despair
,
but
nearly
.
I
get
,
''
said
Richard
,
*NL*
relinquishing
my
hand
gently
and
walking
across
the
room
,
``
so
tired
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
few
turns
up
and
down
and
sunk
upon
the
sofa
.
``
I
get
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
gloomily
,
``
so
tired
.
It
is
such
weary
,
weary
work
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
leaning
on
his
arm
saying
these
words
in
a
meditative
voice
*NL*
and
looking
at
the
ground
when
my
darling
rose
,
put
off
her
bonnet
,
*NL*
kneeled
down
beside
him
with
her
golden
hair
falling
like
sunlight
on
*NL*
his
head
,
clasped
her
two
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
turned
her
face
to
*NL*
me
.
Oh
,
what
a
loving
and
devoted
face
I
saw
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
dear
,
''
she
said
very
quietly
,
``
I
am
not
going
home
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
shone
in
upon
me
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
any
more
.
I
am
going
to
stay
with
my
dear
husband
.
We
have
*NL*
been
married
above
two
months
.
Go
home
without
me
,
my
own
Esther
;
I
*NL*
shall
never
go
home
any
more
!
''
With
those
words
my
darling
drew
his
*NL*
head
down
on
her
breast
and
held
it
there
.
And
if
ever
in
my
life
I
*NL*
saw
a
love
that
nothing
but
death
could
change
,
I
saw
it
then
before
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
Esther
,
my
dearest
,
''
said
Richard
,
breaking
the
silence
*NL*
presently
.
``
Tell
her
how
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
met
her
before
she
could
come
to
me
and
folded
her
in
my
arms
.
We
*NL*
neither
of
us
spoke
,
but
with
her
cheek
against
my
own
I
wanted
to
*NL*
hear
nothing
.
``
My
pet
,
''
said
I.
``
My
love
.
My
poor
,
poor
girl
!
''
I
*NL*
pitied
her
so
much
.
I
was
very
fond
of
Richard
,
but
the
impulse
that
*NL*
I
had
upon
me
was
to
pity
her
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
will
you
forgive
me
?
Will
my
cousin
John
forgive
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
doubt
it
for
a
moment
is
to
do
him
a
great
*NL*
wrong
.
And
as
to
me
!
''
Why
,
as
to
me
,
what
had
I
to
forgive
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
dried
my
sobbing
darling
's
eyes
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
sofa
,
and
*NL*
Richard
sat
on
my
other
side
;
and
while
I
was
reminded
of
that
so
*NL*
different
night
when
they
had
first
taken
me
into
their
confidence
*NL*
and
had
gone
on
in
their
own
wild
happy
way
,
they
told
me
between
*NL*
them
how
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
had
was
Richard
's
,
''
Ada
said
;
``
and
Richard
would
not
take
it
,
*NL*
Esther
,
and
what
could
I
do
but
be
his
wife
when
I
loved
him
dearly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
were
so
fully
and
so
kindly
occupied
,
excellent
Dame
*NL*
Durden
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
that
how
could
we
speak
to
you
at
such
a
*NL*
time
!
And
besides
,
it
was
not
a
long-considered
step
.
We
went
out
one
*NL*
morning
and
were
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
it
was
done
,
Esther
,
''
said
my
darling
,
``
I
was
always
*NL*
thinking
how
to
tell
you
and
what
to
do
for
the
best
.
And
sometimes
I
*NL*
thought
you
ought
to
know
it
directly
,
and
sometimes
I
thought
you
*NL*
ought
not
to
know
it
and
keep
it
from
my
cousin
John
;
and
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
what
to
do
,
and
I
fretted
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
selfish
I
must
have
been
not
to
have
thought
of
this
before
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
I
said
now
.
I
was
so
sorry
,
and
yet
I
was
so
fond
of
*NL*
them
and
so
glad
that
they
were
fond
of
me
;
I
pitied
them
so
much
,
*NL*
and
yet
I
felt
a
kind
of
pride
in
their
loving
one
another
.
I
never
*NL*
had
experienced
such
painful
and
pleasurable
emotion
at
one
time
,
and
*NL*
in
my
own
heart
I
did
not
know
which
predominated
.
But
I
was
not
*NL*
there
to
darken
their
way
;
I
did
not
do
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
less
foolish
and
more
composed
,
my
darling
took
her
*NL*
wedding-ring
from
her
bosom
,
and
kissed
it
,
and
put
it
on
.
Then
I
*NL*
remembered
last
night
and
told
Richard
that
ever
since
her
marriage
*NL*
she
had
worn
it
at
night
when
there
was
no
one
to
see
.
Then
Ada
*NL*
blushingly
asked
me
how
did
I
know
that
,
my
dear
.
Then
I
told
Ada
how
*NL*
I
had
seen
her
hand
concealed
under
her
pillow
and
had
little
thought
*NL*
why
,
my
dear
.
Then
they
began
telling
me
how
it
was
all
over
again
,
*NL*
and
I
began
to
be
sorry
and
glad
again
,
and
foolish
again
,
and
to
*NL*
hide
my
plain
old
face
as
much
as
I
could
lest
I
should
put
them
out
*NL*
of
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
time
went
on
until
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
think
of
*NL*
returning
.
When
that
time
arrived
it
was
the
worst
of
all
,
for
then
*NL*
my
darling
completely
broke
down
.
She
clung
round
my
neck
,
calling
me
*NL*
by
every
dear
name
she
could
think
of
and
saying
what
should
she
do
*NL*
without
me
!
Nor
was
Richard
much
better
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
should
have
*NL*
been
the
worst
of
the
three
if
I
had
not
severely
said
to
myself
,
*NL*
``
Now
Esther
,
if
you
do
,
I
'll
never
speak
to
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
declare
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
never
saw
such
a
wife
.
I
do
n't
think
she
*NL*
loves
her
husband
at
all
.
Here
,
Richard
,
take
my
child
,
for
goodness
'
*NL*
sake
.
''
But
I
held
her
tight
all
the
while
,
and
could
have
wept
over
*NL*
her
I
do
n't
know
how
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
this
dear
young
couple
notice
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
am
only
going
*NL*
away
to
come
back
to-morrow
and
that
I
shall
be
always
coming
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
until
Symond
's
Inn
is
tired
of
the
sight
of
*NL*
me
.
So
I
shall
not
say
good-bye
,
Richard
.
For
what
would
be
the
use
*NL*
of
that
,
you
know
,
when
I
am
coming
back
so
soon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
given
my
darling
to
him
now
,
and
I
meant
to
go
;
but
I
lingered
*NL*
for
one
more
look
of
the
precious
face
which
it
seemed
to
rive
my
*NL*
heart
to
turn
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
said
-LRB-
in
a
merry
,
bustling
manner
-RRB-
that
unless
they
gave
me
some
*NL*
encouragement
to
come
back
,
I
was
not
sure
that
I
could
take
that
*NL*
liberty
,
upon
which
my
dear
girl
looked
up
,
faintly
smiling
through
*NL*
her
tears
,
and
I
folded
her
lovely
face
between
my
hands
,
and
gave
it
*NL*
one
last
kiss
,
and
laughed
,
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
I
got
downstairs
,
oh
,
how
I
cried
!
It
almost
seemed
to
me
*NL*
that
I
had
lost
my
Ada
for
ever
.
I
was
so
lonely
and
so
blank
without
*NL*
her
,
and
it
was
so
desolate
to
be
going
home
with
no
hope
of
seeing
*NL*
her
there
,
that
I
could
get
no
comfort
for
a
little
while
as
I
walked
*NL*
up
and
down
in
a
dim
corner
sobbing
and
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
to
myself
by
and
by
,
after
a
little
scolding
,
and
took
a
coach
*NL*
home
.
The
poor
boy
whom
I
had
found
at
St.
Albans
had
reappeared
a
*NL*
short
time
before
and
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
;
indeed
,
was
*NL*
then
dead
,
though
I
did
not
know
it
.
My
guardian
had
gone
out
to
*NL*
inquire
about
him
and
did
not
return
to
dinner
.
Being
quite
alone
,
I
*NL*
cried
a
little
again
,
though
on
the
whole
I
do
n't
think
I
behaved
so
*NL*
very
,
very
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
natural
that
I
should
not
be
quite
accustomed
to
the
loss
*NL*
of
my
darling
yet
.
Three
or
four
hours
were
not
a
long
time
after
*NL*
years
.
But
my
mind
dwelt
so
much
upon
the
uncongenial
scene
in
which
*NL*
I
had
left
her
,
and
I
pictured
it
as
such
an
overshadowed
*NL*
stony-hearted
one
,
and
I
so
longed
to
be
near
her
and
taking
some
*NL*
sort
of
care
of
her
,
that
I
determined
to
go
back
in
the
evening
only
*NL*
to
look
up
at
her
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
foolish
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
did
not
then
seem
at
all
so
to
me
,
*NL*
and
it
does
not
seem
quite
so
even
now
.
I
took
Charley
into
my
*NL*
confidence
,
and
we
went
out
at
dusk
.
It
was
dark
when
we
came
to
the
*NL*
new
strange
home
of
my
dear
girl
,
and
there
was
a
light
behind
the
*NL*
yellow
blinds
.
We
walked
past
cautiously
three
or
four
times
,
looking
*NL*
up
,
and
narrowly
missed
encountering
Mr.
Vholes
,
who
came
out
of
his
*NL*
office
while
we
were
there
and
turned
his
head
to
look
up
too
before
*NL*
going
home
.
The
sight
of
his
lank
black
figure
and
the
lonesome
air
*NL*
of
that
nook
in
the
dark
were
favourable
to
the
state
of
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
thought
of
the
youth
and
love
and
beauty
of
my
dear
girl
,
shut
up
in
*NL*
such
an
ill-assorted
refuge
,
almost
as
if
it
were
a
cruel
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
solitary
and
very
dull
,
and
I
did
not
doubt
that
I
might
*NL*
safely
steal
upstairs
.
I
left
Charley
below
and
went
up
with
a
light
*NL*
foot
,
not
distressed
by
any
glare
from
the
feeble
oil
lanterns
on
the
*NL*
way
.
I
listened
for
a
few
moments
,
and
in
the
musty
rotting
silence
*NL*
of
the
house
believed
that
I
could
hear
the
murmur
of
their
young
*NL*
voices
.
I
put
my
lips
to
the
hearse-like
panel
of
the
door
as
a
kiss
*NL*
for
my
dear
and
came
quietly
down
again
,
thinking
that
one
of
these
*NL*
days
I
would
confess
to
the
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
really
did
me
good
,
for
though
nobody
but
Charley
and
I
knew
*NL*
anything
about
it
,
I
somehow
felt
as
if
it
had
diminished
the
*NL*
separation
between
Ada
and
me
and
had
brought
us
together
again
for
*NL*
those
moments
.
I
went
back
,
not
quite
accustomed
yet
to
the
change
,
*NL*
but
all
the
better
for
that
hovering
about
my
darling
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
had
come
home
and
was
standing
thoughtfully
by
the
dark
*NL*
window
.
When
I
went
in
,
his
face
cleared
and
he
came
to
his
seat
,
but
*NL*
he
caught
the
light
upon
my
face
as
I
took
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
woman
,
''
said
he
,
``
You
have
been
crying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
afraid
I
have
been
,
a
little
.
Ada
*NL*
has
been
in
such
distress
,
and
is
so
very
sorry
,
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
,
and
I
saw
in
his
glance
that
*NL*
my
words
and
my
look
at
her
empty
place
had
prepared
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
married
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
all
about
it
and
how
her
first
entreaties
had
referred
to
*NL*
his
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
no
need
of
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
Heaven
bless
her
and
her
husband
!
''
*NL*
But
just
as
my
first
impulse
had
been
to
pity
her
,
so
was
his
.
``
Poor
*NL*
girl
,
poor
girl
!
Poor
Rick
!
Poor
Ada
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
us
spoke
after
that
,
until
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
my
dear
!
Bleak
House
is
thinning
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
its
mistress
remains
,
guardian
.
''
Though
I
was
timid
about
saying
*NL*
it
,
I
ventured
because
of
the
sorrowful
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
.
*NL*
``
She
will
do
all
she
can
to
make
it
happy
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
succeed
,
my
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
had
made
no
difference
between
us
except
that
the
seat
by
*NL*
his
side
had
come
to
be
mine
;
it
made
none
now
.
He
turned
his
old
*NL*
bright
fatherly
look
upon
me
,
laid
his
hand
on
my
hand
in
his
old
*NL*
way
,
and
said
again
,
``
She
will
succeed
,
my
dear
.
Nevertheless
,
Bleak
*NL*
House
is
thinning
fast
,
O
little
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sorry
presently
that
this
was
all
we
said
about
that
.
I
was
*NL*
rather
disappointed
.
I
feared
I
might
not
quite
have
been
all
I
had
*NL*
meant
to
be
since
the
letter
and
the
answer
.

CHAPTER
LII
*NL*
*NL*
Obstinacy
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
other
day
had
intervened
when
,
early
in
the
morning
as
we
*NL*
were
going
to
breakfast
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
came
in
haste
with
the
*NL*
astounding
news
that
a
terrible
murder
had
been
committed
for
which
*NL*
Mr.
George
had
been
apprehended
and
was
in
custody
.
When
he
told
us
*NL*
that
a
large
reward
was
offered
by
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
for
the
*NL*
murderer
's
apprehension
,
I
did
not
in
my
first
consternation
*NL*
understand
why
;
but
a
few
more
words
explained
to
me
that
the
*NL*
murdered
person
was
Sir
Leicester
's
lawyer
,
and
immediately
my
*NL*
mother
's
dread
of
him
rushed
into
my
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unforeseen
and
violent
removal
of
one
whom
she
had
long
watched
*NL*
and
distrusted
and
who
had
long
watched
and
distrusted
her
,
one
for
*NL*
whom
she
could
have
had
few
intervals
of
kindness
,
always
dreading
in
*NL*
him
a
dangerous
and
secret
enemy
,
appeared
so
awful
that
my
first
*NL*
thoughts
were
of
her
.
How
appalling
to
hear
of
such
a
death
and
be
*NL*
able
to
feel
no
pity
!
How
dreadful
to
remember
,
perhaps
,
that
she
had
*NL*
sometimes
even
wished
the
old
man
away
who
was
so
swiftly
hurried
out
*NL*
of
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
Such
crowding
reflections
,
increasing
the
distress
and
fear
I
always
*NL*
felt
when
the
name
was
mentioned
,
made
me
so
agitated
that
I
could
*NL*
scarcely
hold
my
place
at
the
table
.
I
was
quite
unable
to
follow
the
*NL*
conversation
until
I
had
had
a
little
time
to
recover
.
But
when
I
*NL*
came
to
myself
and
saw
how
shocked
my
guardian
was
and
found
that
*NL*
they
were
earnestly
speaking
of
the
suspected
man
and
recalling
every
*NL*
favourable
impression
we
had
formed
of
him
out
of
the
good
we
had
*NL*
known
of
him
,
my
interest
and
my
fears
were
so
strongly
aroused
in
*NL*
his
behalf
that
I
was
quite
set
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guardian
,
you
do
n't
think
it
possible
that
he
is
justly
accused
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
I
CA
N'T
think
so
.
This
man
whom
we
have
seen
so
*NL*
open-hearted
and
compassionate
,
who
with
the
might
of
a
giant
has
the
*NL*
gentleness
of
a
child
,
who
looks
as
brave
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
and
*NL*
is
so
simple
and
quiet
with
it
,
this
man
justly
accused
of
such
a
*NL*
crime
?
I
ca
n't
believe
it
.
It
's
not
that
I
do
n't
or
I
wo
n't
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
``
Still
,
whatever
we
believe
or
*NL*
know
of
him
,
we
had
better
not
forget
that
some
appearances
are
*NL*
against
him
.
He
bore
an
animosity
towards
the
deceased
gentleman
.
He
*NL*
has
openly
mentioned
it
in
many
places
.
He
is
said
to
have
expressed
*NL*
himself
violently
towards
him
,
and
he
certainly
did
about
him
,
to
my
*NL*
knowledge
.
He
admits
that
he
was
alone
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
*NL*
within
a
few
minutes
of
its
commission
.
I
sincerely
believe
him
to
be
*NL*
as
innocent
of
any
participation
in
it
as
I
am
,
but
these
are
all
*NL*
reasons
for
suspicion
falling
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
And
he
added
,
turning
to
me
,
``
It
would
be
*NL*
doing
him
a
very
bad
service
,
my
dear
,
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
truth
*NL*
in
any
of
these
respects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
,
of
course
,
that
we
must
admit
,
not
only
to
ourselves
but
to
*NL*
others
,
the
full
force
of
the
circumstances
against
him
.
Yet
I
knew
*NL*
withal
-LRB-
I
could
not
help
saying
-RRB-
that
their
weight
would
not
induce
*NL*
us
to
desert
him
in
his
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
!
''
returned
my
guardian
.
``
We
will
stand
by
him
,
as
he
*NL*
himself
stood
by
the
two
poor
creatures
who
are
gone
.
''
He
meant
Mr.
*NL*
Gridley
and
the
boy
,
to
both
of
whom
Mr.
George
had
given
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
then
told
us
that
the
trooper
's
man
had
been
with
him
*NL*
before
day
,
after
wandering
about
the
streets
all
night
like
a
*NL*
distracted
creature
.
That
one
of
the
trooper
's
first
anxieties
was
*NL*
that
we
should
not
suppose
him
guilty
.
That
he
had
charged
his
*NL*
messenger
to
represent
his
perfect
innocence
with
every
solemn
*NL*
assurance
he
could
send
us
.
That
Mr.
Woodcourt
had
only
quieted
the
*NL*
man
by
undertaking
to
come
to
our
house
very
early
in
the
morning
*NL*
with
these
representations
.
He
added
that
he
was
now
upon
his
way
to
*NL*
see
the
prisoner
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
said
directly
he
would
go
too
.
Now
,
besides
that
I
liked
*NL*
the
retired
soldier
very
much
and
that
he
liked
me
,
I
had
that
secret
*NL*
interest
in
what
had
happened
which
was
only
known
to
my
guardian
.
I
*NL*
felt
as
if
it
came
close
and
near
to
me
.
It
seemed
to
become
*NL*
personally
important
to
myself
that
the
truth
should
be
discovered
*NL*
and
that
no
innocent
people
should
be
suspected
,
for
suspicion
,
once
*NL*
run
wild
,
might
run
wilder
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
I
felt
as
if
it
were
my
duty
and
obligation
to
go
with
*NL*
them
.
My
guardian
did
not
seek
to
dissuade
me
,
and
I
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
large
prison
with
many
courts
and
passages
so
like
one
*NL*
another
and
so
uniformly
paved
that
I
seemed
to
gain
a
new
*NL*
comprehension
,
as
I
passed
along
,
of
the
fondness
that
solitary
*NL*
prisoners
,
shut
up
among
the
same
staring
walls
from
year
to
year
,
*NL*
have
had
--
as
I
have
read
--
for
a
weed
or
a
stray
blade
of
grass
.
In
an
*NL*
arched
room
by
himself
,
like
a
cellar
upstairs
,
with
walls
so
*NL*
glaringly
white
that
they
made
the
massive
iron
window-bars
and
*NL*
iron-bound
door
even
more
profoundly
black
than
they
were
,
we
found
*NL*
the
trooper
standing
in
a
corner
.
He
had
been
sitting
on
a
bench
*NL*
there
and
had
risen
when
he
heard
the
locks
and
bolts
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
us
,
he
came
forward
a
step
with
his
usual
heavy
tread
,
*NL*
and
there
stopped
and
made
a
slight
bow
.
But
as
I
still
advanced
,
*NL*
putting
out
my
hand
to
him
,
he
understood
us
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
load
off
my
mind
,
I
do
assure
you
,
miss
and
gentlemen
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
saluting
us
with
great
heartiness
and
drawing
a
long
breath
.
*NL*
``
And
now
I
do
n't
so
much
care
how
it
ends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
scarcely
seemed
to
be
the
prisoner
.
What
with
his
coolness
and
his
*NL*
soldierly
bearing
,
he
looked
far
more
like
the
prison
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
even
a
rougher
place
than
my
gallery
to
receive
a
lady
in
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
George
,
``
but
I
know
Miss
Summerson
will
make
the
best
of
*NL*
it
.
''
As
he
handed
me
to
the
bench
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
,
I
sat
*NL*
down
,
which
seemed
to
give
him
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
miss
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
George
,
''
observed
my
guardian
,
``
as
we
require
no
new
assurances
*NL*
on
your
part
,
so
I
believe
we
need
give
you
none
on
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
sir
.
I
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
.
If
I
was
not
*NL*
innocent
of
this
crime
,
I
could
n't
look
at
you
and
keep
my
secret
to
*NL*
myself
under
the
condescension
of
the
present
visit
.
I
feel
the
*NL*
present
visit
very
much
.
I
am
not
one
of
the
eloquent
sort
,
but
I
*NL*
feel
it
,
Miss
Summerson
and
gentlemen
,
deeply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
broad
chest
and
bent
his
head
to
*NL*
us
.
Although
he
squared
himself
again
directly
,
he
expressed
a
great
*NL*
amount
of
natural
emotion
by
these
simple
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
can
we
do
anything
for
your
personal
*NL*
comfort
,
George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
which
,
sir
?
''
he
inquired
,
clearing
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
your
personal
comfort
.
Is
there
anything
you
want
that
would
*NL*
lessen
the
hardship
of
this
confinement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
replied
George
,
after
a
little
cogitation
,
``
I
am
equally
*NL*
obliged
to
you
,
but
tobacco
being
against
the
rules
,
I
ca
n't
say
that
*NL*
there
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
think
of
many
little
things
perhaps
,
by
and
by
.
Whenever
*NL*
you
do

George
,
let
us
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

Howsoever

observed
Mr.
George
with
one
of
his
*NL*
sunburnt
smiles
,
``
a
man
who
has
been
knocking
about
the
world
in
a
*NL*
vagabond
kind
of
a
way
as
long
as
I
have
gets
on
well
enough
in
a
*NL*
place
like
the
present
,
so
far
as
that
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
,
as
to
your
case
,
''
observed
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so

''
returned
Mr.
George
,
folding
his
arms
upon
his
*NL*
breast
with
perfect
self-possession
and
a
little
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
it
stand
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
it
is
under
remand
at
present
.
Bucket
gives
me
to
*NL*
understand
that
he
will
probably
apply
for
a
series
of
remands
from
*NL*
time
to
time
until
the
case
is
more
complete

How
it
is
to
be
made
*NL*
more
complete
I
do
n't
myself

I
dare
say
Bucket
will
manage
*NL*
it
somehow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
heaven
save
us
,

''
exclaimed
my
guardian
,
surprised
into
his
*NL*
old
oddity
and
vehemence
,
``
you
talk
of
yourself
as
if
you
were
*NL*
somebody
else

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
offence

sir
,
''
said
Mr.
George
.
``
I
am
very
sensible
of
your
*NL*
kindness

But
I
do
n't
see
how
an
innocent
man
is
to
make
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
this
kind
of
thing
without
knocking
his
head
against
the
walls
*NL*
unless
he
takes
it
in
that
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
enough
to
a
certain
extent

returned
my
guardian
,
*NL*
softened
.
``
But
my
good

take

ordinary
precautions

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

I

done

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

rejoined
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo

it
indeed

Rather
a

look-out
for

Mr.

*NL*
good-humouredly
observed

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have

pursued
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask

said
Mr.

with
a
step
backward
.

Mr.

shook
his

in
the
most
emphatic
manner

*NL*
*NL*

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

my

explained

a
little
at
a
loss
;

*NL*
equity

George

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it

indeed

returned
the
trooper
in
his
off-hand
manner
.
``
I
*NL*
am
not
acquainted
with
those
shades
of

in
a
general
*NL*
way
I
object
to
the
breed

''
*NL*
*NL*
Unfolding
his
arms
and
changing
his
position
,
he
stood
with
one
*NL*
massive
hand
upon
the
table
and
the
other
on
his
hip
,
as
complete
a
*NL*
picture
of
a
man
who
was
not
to
be
moved
from
a
fixed
purpose
as
ever
*NL*
I
saw
.
It
was
in
vain
that
we
all
three
talked
to
him
and
endeavoured
*NL*
to
persuade
him
;
he
listened
with
that
gentleness
which
went
so
well
*NL*
with
his
bluff
bearing
,
but
was
evidently
no
more
shaken
by
our
*NL*
representations
that
his
place
of
confinement
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
think
,
once
more

Mr.
George

said
I.
``
Have
you
no
wish
in
*NL*
reference
to
your
case

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
could
wish
it
to
be
tried

he
returned
,
``
by
*NL*
court-martial
;
but
that
is
out
of
the
question

I
am
well
aware

you
will
be
so
good
as
to
favour
me

your
attention

couple
of
minutes

more

I
'll
endeavour
to
explain
myself

as
clearly
as
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
us
all
three
in
turn
,
shook
his
head
a
little
as
if
he
*NL*
were
adjusting
it
in
the
stock
and
collar
of
a
tight
uniform
,
and
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
reflection
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
miss
,
I
have
been
handcuffed
and
taken
into
custody
and
*NL*
brought
here
.
I
am
a
marked
and
disgraced
man
,
and
here
I
am
.
My
*NL*
shooting
gallery
is
rummaged
,
high
and
low
,
by
Bucket
;
such
property
*NL*
as
I
have
--
't
is
small
--
is
turned
this
way
and
that
till
it
do
n't
know
*NL*
itself
;
and
-LRB-
as
aforesaid
-RRB-
here
I
am
!
I
do
n't
particular
complain
of
*NL*
that
.
Though
I
am
in
these
present
quarters
through
no
immediately
*NL*
preceding
fault
of
mine
,
I
can
very
well
understand
that
if
I
had
n't
*NL*
gone
into
the
vagabond
way
in
my
youth
,
this
would
n't
have
happened
.
*NL*
It
HAS
happened
.
Then
comes
the
question
how
to
meet
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
swarthy
forehead
for
a
moment
with
a
good-humoured
look
*NL*
and
said
apologetically
,
``
I
am
such
a
short-winded
talker
that
I
must
*NL*
think
a
bit
.
''
Having
thought
a
bit
,
he
looked
up
again
and
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
to
meet
it
.
Now
,
the
unfortunate
deceased
was
himself
a
lawyer
*NL*
and
had
a
pretty
tight
hold
of
me
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
rake
up
his
ashes
,
*NL*
but
he
had
,
what
I
should
call
if
he
was
living
,
a
devil
of
a
tight
*NL*
hold
of
me
.
I
do
n't
like
his
trade
the
better
for
that
.
If
I
had
kept
*NL*
clear
of
his
trade
,
I
should
have
kept
outside
this
place
.
But
that
's
*NL*
not
what
I
mean
.
Now
,
suppose
I
had
killed
him
.
Suppose
I
really
had
*NL*
discharged
into
his
body
any
one
of
those
pistols
recently
fired
off
*NL*
that
Bucket
has
found
at
my
place
,
and
dear
me
,
might
have
found
*NL*
there
any
day
since
it
has
been
my
place
.
What
should
I
have
done
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
was
hard
and
fast
here
?
Got
a
lawyer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
on
hearing
some
one
at
the
locks
and
bolts
and
did
not
*NL*
resume
until
the
door
had
been
opened
and
was
shut
again
.
For
what
*NL*
purpose
opened
,
I
will
mention
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
got
a
lawyer
,
and
he
would
have
said
-LRB-
as
I
have
often
*NL*
read
in
the
newspapers
-RRB-
,
`
My
client
says
nothing
,
my
client
reserves
*NL*
his
defence
'
:
my
client
this
,
that
,
and
t
`
other

Well
,
't
is
not
the
*NL*
custom
of
that
breed
to
go
straight
,
according
to
my
opinion
,
or
to
*NL*
think
that
other
men
do
.
Say
I
am
innocent
and
I
get
a
lawyer
.
He
*NL*
would
be
as
likely
to
believe
me
guilty
as
not
;
perhaps
more
.
What
*NL*
would
he
do
,
whether
or
not
?
Act
as
if
I
was
--
shut
my
mouth
up
,
tell
*NL*
me
not
to
commit
myself
,
keep
circumstances
back
,
chop
the
evidence
*NL*
small
,
quibble
,
and
get
me
off
perhaps
!
But
,
Miss
Summerson
,
do
I
*NL*
care
for
getting
off
in
that
way
;
or
would
I
rather
be
hanged
in
my
*NL*
own
way
--
if
you
'll
excuse
my
mentioning
anything
so
disagreeable
to
a
*NL*
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
warmed
into
his
subject
now
,
and
was
under
no
further
*NL*
necessity
to
wait
a
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
be
hanged
in
my
own
way

And
I
mean
to
be
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
intend
to
say
,
''
looking
round
upon
us
with
his
powerful
arms
akimbo
*NL*
and
his
dark
eyebrows
raised
,
``
that
I
am
more
partial
to
being
hanged
*NL*
than
another
man

What
I
say
is
,
I
must
come
off
clear
and
full
or
*NL*
not
at
all
.
Therefore
,
when
I
hear
stated
against
me
what
is
true
,
I
*NL*
say
it
's
true
;
and
when
they
tell
me
,
`
whatever
you

will
be
*NL*
used

I
tell
them
I
do
n't
mind
that
;
I
mean
it
to
be
used

If
they
*NL*
ca
n't
make
me
innocent
out
of
the
whole
truth
,
they
are
not
likely
to
*NL*
do
it
out
of
anything
less

or
anything
else

And
if
they
are
,
it
's
*NL*
worth
nothing
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
Taking
a
pace
or
two
over
the
stone
floor
,
he
came
back
to
the
table
*NL*
and
finished
what
he
had
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you

miss

gentlemen
both
,
many
times
for
your
attention

many

your
interest

That
's
the
plain
state
of
the
*NL*
matter
as
it
points
itself
out
to
a
mere
trooper
with
a
blunt

broadsword
kind
of
a

I
have
never
done
well
in

my

duty

soldier

if
the
worst
comes
after
all

I
shall
reap
*NL*
pretty
much

I
have
sown

When

got
over
the
first
crash

being

seized

has
knocked
about
so

much

myself

very

worked

remain

No

that
's
all
*NL*
I
've
got
to
say

*NL*
*NL*
The
door
had
been
opened
to
admit
another
soldier-looking
man
of
less
*NL*
prepossessing
appearance
at
first
sight
and
a
weather-tanned
,
*NL*
bright-eyed

basket
,
who
,
from
her
entrance
,
*NL*
had
been
exceedingly
attentive
to
all
Mr.
George
had
said
.
Mr.
George
*NL*
had
received
them
with
a
familiar
nod
and
a
friendly
look
,
but
*NL*
without
any
more
particular
greeting
in
the
midst
of
his
address
.
He
*NL*
now
shook
them
cordially
by
the
hand
and
said
,
``
Miss
Summerson
and
*NL*
gentlemen
,
this
is
an
old
comrade
of
mine

Matthew
Bagnet

And
this

is
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
made
us
a
stiff
military
bow
,
and
Mrs.
Bagnet
dropped
us
a
*NL*
curtsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Real
good
friends

sald
Mr.

It

I
was
taken

*NL*
*NL*
``
With

wiolinceller

''
Mr.
Bagnet
put
in
,
twitching
his
*NL*
head
angrily
.
``
Of
a
good
tone

That
money

no

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
``
you

it
meets
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bagnet
,
after
considering
,
referred
the
point
to
his
wife
.
``
Old

said
he
.
``
Tell
him

Whether

It

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

George
,
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
who
had
been
unpacking
her
*NL*
basket
,
in
which
there
was
a
piece
of
cold
pickled
pork
,
a
little
tea
*NL*
and
sugar
,
and
a
brown
loaf
,
``
you
ought
to
know
it

You
ought

to
know
it
's
enough
to

wild
to
hear
you
.
You
wo
n't
be
*NL*
got
off
this
way
,
and
you
wo

be
got
off

what
do
you
mean
*NL*
by
such
picking
and
choosing

It
's
stuff

nonsense

George

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
severe
upon
me
in
my
misfortunes
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
''
said
the
*NL*
trooper
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Bother
your
misfortunes
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
``
if
they
do
n't
make
*NL*
you
more
reasonable

that
comes
to

I
never
was
so
ashamed
in
my
*NL*
life
to
hear
a
man
talk
folly
as
I
have
been
to
hear
you
talk
this
*NL*
day
to
the
present
company

Lawyers

Why
,
what
but
too
many
cooks
*NL*
should
hinder
you
from
having
a
dozen
lawyers
if
the
gentleman
*NL*
recommended
them
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
very
sensible
woman
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
I
hope
you
will
*NL*
persuade
him
,
Mrs.
Bagnet

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Persuade
him

sir

''
she
returned
.
``
Lord
bless
you

no

You
do
n't
*NL*
know
George

Now
,
there
!
''
Mrs.
Bagnet
left
her
basket
to
point
him
*NL*
out
with
both
her
bare
brown
hands
.
``
There
he
stands
!
As
self-willed
*NL*
and
as
determined
a
man
,
in
the
wrong
way
,
as
ever
put
a
human
*NL*
creature
under
heaven
out
of
patience
!
You
could
as
soon
take
up
and
*NL*
shoulder
an
eight
and
forty
pounder
by
your
own
strength
as
turn
that
*NL*
man
when
he
has
got
a
thing
into
his
head
and
fixed
it
there
.
Why
,
*NL*
do
n't
I
know
him
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Bagnet
.
``
Do
n't
I
know
you
,
George
!
You
*NL*
do
n't
mean

up

character
with
ME
after
all
these
*NL*
years
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
friendly
indignation
had
an
exemplary
effect
upon
her
husband
,
*NL*
who
shook
his
head
at
the
trooper
several
times
as
a
silent
*NL*
recommendation
to
him
to
yield
.
Between
whiles
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
looked
at
*NL*
me
;
and
I
understood
from
the
play
of
her
eyes
that
she
wished
me
to
*NL*
do
something
,
though
I
did
not
comprehend
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
given
up
talking
to
you
,
old
fellow
,
years
and
years
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Bagnet
as
she
blew
a
little
dust
off
the
pickled
pork
,
*NL*
looking
at
me
again
;
``
and
when
ladies
and
gentlemen
know
you
as
well
*NL*
as
I
do
,
they
'll
give
up
talking
to
you
too
.
If
you
are
not
too
*NL*
headstrong
to
accept
of
a
bit
of
dinner
,
here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
accept
it
with
many
thanks
,
''
returned
the
trooper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
though
,
indeed
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
continuing
to
grumble
on
*NL*
good-humouredly
.
``
I
'm
sure
I
'm
surprised
at
that
.
I
wonder
you
do
n't
*NL*
starve
in
your
own
way
also
.
It
would
only
be
like
you
.
Perhaps
*NL*
you
'll
set
your
mind
upon
THAT
next
.
''
Here
she
again
looked
at
me
,
*NL*
and
I
now
perceived
from
her
glances
at
the
door
and
at
me
,
by
turns
,
*NL*
that
she
wished
us
to
retire
and
to
await
her
following
us
outside
*NL*
the
prison
.
Communicating
this
by
similar
means
to
my
guardian
and
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
I
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
hope
you
will
think
better
of
it
,
Mr.
George
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
we
*NL*
shall
come
to
see
you
again
,
trusting
to
find
you
more
reasonable
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
More
grateful
,
Miss
Summerson
,
you
ca
n't
find
me

''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
more
persuadable
we
can
,
I
hope
,
''
said
I.
``
And
let
me
entreat
*NL*
you
to
consider
that
the
clearing
up
of
this
mystery
and
the
*NL*
discovery
of
the
real
perpetrator
of
this
deed
may
be
of
the
last
*NL*
importance
to
others
besides
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
me
respectfully
but
without
much
heeding
these
words
,
which
*NL*
I
spoke
a
little
turned
from
him
,
already
on
my
way
to
the
door
;
he
*NL*
was
observing
-LRB-
this
they
afterwards
told
me
-RRB-
my
height
and
figure
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
catch
his
attention
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
curious
,
''
said
he
.
``
And
yet
I
thought
so
at
the
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
asked
him
what
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
he
answered
,
``
when
my
ill
fortune
took
me
to
the
dead
*NL*
man
's
staircase
on
the
night
of
his
murder
,
I
saw
a
shape
so
like
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
's
go
by
me
in
the
dark
that
I
had
half
a
mind
to
speak
*NL*
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
I
felt
such
a
shudder
as
I
never
felt
before
or
since
*NL*
and
hope
I
shall
never
feel
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
came
downstairs
as
I
went
up
,
''
said
the
trooper
,
``
and
crossed
the
*NL*
moonlighted
window
with
a
loose
black
mantle
on
;
I
noticed
a
deep
*NL*
fringe
to
it
.
However
,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
subject
,
*NL*
excepting
that
Miss
Summerson
looked
so
like
it
at
the
moment
that
it
*NL*
came
into
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
separate
and
define
the
feelings
that
arose
in
me
after
*NL*
this
;
it
is
enough
that
the
vague
duty
and
obligation
I
had
felt
upon
*NL*
me
from
the
first
of
following
the
investigation
was
,
without
my
*NL*
distinctly
daring
to
ask
myself
any
question
,
increased
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
indignantly
sure
of
there
being
no
possibility
of
a
reason
for
my
*NL*
being
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
three
went
out
of
the
prison
and
walked
up
and
down
at
some
short
*NL*
distance
from
the
gate
,
which
was
in
a
retired
place
.
We
had
not
*NL*
waited
long
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bagnet
came
out
too
and
quickly
joined
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tear
in
each
of
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
eyes
,
and
her
face
was
*NL*
flushed
and
hurried
.
``
I
did
n't
let
George
see
what
I
thought
about
*NL*
it
,
you
know
,
miss
,
''
was
her
first
remark
when
she
came
up
,
``
but
he
's
*NL*
in
a
bad
way
,
poor
old
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
with
care
and
prudence
and
good
help

said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
gentleman
like
you
ought
to
know
best

''
returned
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
*NL*
hurriedly
drying
her
eyes
on
the
hem
of
her
grey
cloak
,
``
but
I
am
*NL*
uneasy
for
him
.
He
has
been
so
careless
and
said
so
much
that
he
*NL*
never
meant
.
The
gentlemen
of
the
juries
might
not
understand
him
as
*NL*
Lignum
and
me
do
.
And
then
such
a
number
of
circumstances
have
*NL*
happened
bad
for
him
,
and
such
a
number
of
people
will
be
brought
*NL*
forward
to
speak
against
him

Bucket
is
so
deep

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
a
second-hand
wiolinceller

And
said
he
played
the
fife

When
a
*NL*
boy
,

Mr.
Bagnet
added
with
great
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

I
tell

said
Mrs.

;
``

come
into

corner

'll
tell

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
hurried
us
into
a
more
secluded
place
and
was
at
first
*NL*
too
breathless
to
proceed
,
occasioning
Mr.
Bagnet
to
say
,
``
Old
girl

*NL*
Tell
'em

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
miss

''
the
old
girl
proceeded
,
untying
the
strings
of
her
*NL*
bonnet
for
more
air
,
``
you
could
as
soon
move
Dover
Castle

move

this
point

you
had
got
a

to
move
him
with

And
I
have
got
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
jewel
of

said
my
guardian
.
``
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
tell
you

she
proceeded
,
clapping
her
hands
in
her
*NL*
hurry
and
agitation
a
dozen
times
in
every
sentence
,
``
that
what
he
*NL*
says
concerning
no
relations
is
all
bosh
.
They
do
n't
know
of
him

but
*NL*
he
does
know
of
them
.
He
has
said
more
to
me
at
odd
times
than
to
*NL*
anybody
else
,
and
it
war
n't
for
nothing
that
he
once
spoke
to
my
*NL*
Woolwich
about
whitening
and
wrinkling
mothers

heads

For
fifty
*NL*
pounds
he
had
seen
his
mother
that
day

She
's
alive

must
be
*NL*
brought
here
straight

*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
Mrs.
Bagnet
put
some
pins
into
her
mouth
and
began
pinning
*NL*
up
her
skirts
all
round
a
little
higher
than
the
level
of
her
grey
*NL*
cloak
,
which
she
accomplished
with
surpassing
dispatch
and
dexterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

,
``

``

my

in
his

pocket

What

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
made
another
application
to
her
skirts
and
brought
forth
*NL*
a
leathern
purse
in
which
she
hastily
counted
over
a
few
shillings
*NL*
and
which
she
then
shut
up
with
perfect
satisfaction

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
actually
set
off
while
we
three
stood
looking
at
one
another
*NL*
lost
in
amazement

She
actually
trudged
away
in
her
grey
cloak
at
a
*NL*
sturdy
pace
,
and
turned
the
corner
,
and
was
gone

*NL*
*NL*

went

CHAPTER
LIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Track
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
and
his
fat
forefinger
are
much
in
consultation
together
*NL*
under
existing
circumstances
.
When
Mr.
Bucket
has
a
matter
of
this
*NL*
pressing
interest
under
his
consideration
,
the
fat
forefinger
seems
*NL*
to
rise
,
to
the
dignity
of
a
familiar
demon
.
He
puts
it
to
his
ears
,
*NL*
and
it
whispers
information
;
he
puts
it
to
his
lips
,
and
it
enjoins
*NL*
him
to
secrecy
;
he
rubs
it
over
his
nose
,
and
it
sharpens
his
scent
;
*NL*
he
shakes
it
before
a
guilty
man
,
and
it
charms
him
to
his
*NL*
destruction
.
The
Augurs
of
the
Detective
Temple
invariably
predict
*NL*
that
when
Mr.
Bucket
and
that
finger
are
in
much
conference
,
a
*NL*
terrible
avenger
will
be
heard
of
before
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Otherwise
mildly
studious
in
his
observation
of
human
nature
,
on
the
*NL*
whole
a
benignant
philosopher
not
disposed
to
be
severe
upon
the
*NL*
follies
of
mankind
,
Mr.
Bucket
pervades
a
vast
number
of
houses
and
*NL*
strolls
about
an
infinity
of
streets
,
to
outward
appearance
rather
*NL*
languishing
for
want
of
an
object
.
He
is
in
the
friendliest
condition
*NL*
towards
his
species
and
will
drink
with
most
of
them
.
He
is
free
with
*NL*
his
money
,
affable
in
his
manners
,
innocent
in
his
conversation
--
but
*NL*
through
the
placid
stream
of
his
life
there
glides
an
under-current
*NL*
of
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
and
place
can
not
bind
Mr.
Bucket
.
Like
man
in
the
abstract
,
he
*NL*
is
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
--
but
,
very
unlike
man
indeed
,
he
is
*NL*
here
again
the
next
day
.
This
evening
he
will
be
casually
looking
*NL*
into
the
iron
extinguishers
at
the
door
of
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
's
*NL*
house
in
town
;
and
to-morrow
morning
he
will
be
walking
on
the
leads
*NL*
at
Chesney
Wold
,
where
erst
the
old
man
walked
whose
ghost
is
*NL*
propitiated
with
a
hundred
guineas
.
Drawers
,
desks
,
pockets
,
all
*NL*
things
belonging
to
him
,
Mr.
Bucket
examines
.
A
few
hours
afterwards
,
*NL*
he
and
the
Roman
will
be
alone
together
comparing
forefingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
likely
that
these
occupations
are
irreconcilable
with
home
*NL*
enjoyment
,
but
it
is
certain
that
Mr.
Bucket
at
present
does
not
go
*NL*
home
.
Though
in
general
he
highly
appreciates
the
society
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Bucket
--
a
lady
of
a
natural
detective
genius
,
which
if
it
had
been
*NL*
improved
by
professional
exercise
,
might
have
done
great
things
,
but
*NL*
which
has
paused
at
the
level
of
a
clever
amateur
--
he
holds
himself
*NL*
aloof
from
that
dear
solace
.
Mrs.
Bucket
is
dependent
on
their
lodger
*NL*
-LRB-
fortunately
an
amiable
lady
in
whom
she
takes
an
interest
-RRB-
for
*NL*
companionship
and
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
crowd
assembles
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
on
the
day
of
the
*NL*
funeral
.
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
attends
the
ceremony
in
person
;
*NL*
strictly
speaking
,
there
are
only
three
other
human
followers
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
Lord
Doodle
,
William
Buffy
,
and
the
debilitated
cousin
*NL*
-LRB-
thrown
in
as
a
make-weight
-RRB-
,
but
the
amount
of
inconsolable
*NL*
carriages
is
immense
.
The
peerage
contributes
more
four-wheeled
*NL*
affliction
than
has
ever
been
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
.
Such
is
the
*NL*
assemblage
of
armorial
bearings
on
coach
panels
that
the
Herald
's
*NL*
College
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
its
father
and
mother
at
a
*NL*
blow
.
The
Duke
of
Foodle
sends
a
splendid
pile
of
dust
and
ashes
,
*NL*
with
silver
wheel-boxes
,
patent
axles
,
all
the
last
improvements
,
and
*NL*
three
bereaved
worms
,
six
feet
high
,
holding
on
behind
,
in
a
bunch
of
*NL*
woe
.
All
the
state
coachmen
in
London
seem
plunged
into
mourning
;
and
*NL*
if
that
dead
old
man
of
the
rusty
garb
be
not
beyond
a
taste
in
*NL*
horseflesh
-LRB-
which
appears
impossible
-RRB-
,
it
must
be
highly
gratified
*NL*
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quiet
among
the
undertakers
and
the
equipages
and
the
calves
of
so
*NL*
many
legs
all
steeped
in
grief
,
Mr.
Bucket
sits
concealed
in
one
of
*NL*
the
inconsolable
carriages
and
at
his
ease
surveys
the
crowd
through
*NL*
the
lattice
blinds
.
He
has
a
keen
eye
for
a
crowd
--
as
for
what
*NL*
not
?
--
and
looking
here
and
there
,
now
from
this
side
of
the
carriage
,
*NL*
now
from
the
other
,
now
up
at
the
house
windows
,
now
along
the
*NL*
people
's
heads
,
nothing
escapes
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
you
are
,
my
partner
,
eh
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
to
himself
,
*NL*
apostrophizing
Mrs.
Bucket
,
stationed
,
by
his
favour
,
on
the
steps
of
*NL*
the
deceased
's
house
.
``
And
so
you
are
.
And
so
you
are
!
And
very
well
*NL*
indeed
you
are
looking
,
Mrs.
Bucket
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
procession
has
not
started
yet
,
but
is
waiting
for
the
cause
of
*NL*
its
assemblage
to
be
brought
out
.
Mr.
Bucket
,
in
the
foremost
*NL*
emblazoned
carriage
,
uses
his
two
fat
forefingers
to
hold
the
lattice
*NL*
a
hair
's
breadth
open
while
he
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
says
a
great
deal
for
his
attachment
,
as
a
husband
,
that
he
is
*NL*
still
occupied
with
Mrs.
B.
``
There
you
are
,
my
partner
,
eh
?
''
he
*NL*
murmuringly
repeats
.
``
And
our
lodger
with
you
.
I
'm
taking
notice
of
*NL*
you
,
Mrs.
Bucket
;
I
hope
you
're
all
right
in
your
health
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
another
word
does
Mr.
Bucket
say
,
but
sits
with
most
attentive
*NL*
eyes
until
the
sacked
depository
of
noble
secrets
is
brought
*NL*
down
--
Where
are
all
those
secrets
now
?
Does
he
keep
them
yet
?
Did
*NL*
they
fly
with
him
on
that
sudden
journey
?
--
and
until
the
procession
*NL*
moves
,
and
Mr.
Bucket
's
view
is
changed
.
After
which
he
composes
*NL*
himself
for
an
easy
ride
and
takes
note
of
the
fittings
of
the
*NL*
carriage
in
case
he
should
ever
find
such
knowledge
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contrast
enough
between
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
shut
up
in
his
dark
carriage
*NL*
and
Mr.
Bucket
shut
up
in
HIS
.
Between
the
immeasurable
track
of
*NL*
space
beyond
the
little
wound
that
has
thrown
the
one
into
the
fixed
*NL*
sleep
which
jolts
so
heavily
over
the
stones
of
the
streets
,
and
the
*NL*
narrow
track
of
blood
which
keeps
the
other
in
the
watchful
state
*NL*
expressed
in
every
hair
of
his
head
!
But
it
is
all
one
to
both
;
*NL*
neither
is
troubled
about
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
sits
out
the
procession
in
his
own
easy
manner
and
glides
*NL*
from
the
carriage
when
the
opportunity
he
has
settled
with
himself
*NL*
arrives
.
He
makes
for
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
's
,
which
is
at
present
a
*NL*
sort
of
home
to
him
,
where
he
comes
and
goes
as
he
likes
at
all
*NL*
hours
,
where
he
is
always
welcome
and
made
much
of
,
where
he
knows
*NL*
the
whole
establishment
,
and
walks
in
an
atmosphere
of
mysterious
*NL*
greatness
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
knocking
or
ringing
for
Mr.
Bucket
.
He
has
caused
himself
to
be
*NL*
provided
with
a
key
and
can
pass
in
at
his
pleasure
.
As
he
is
*NL*
crossing
the
hall
,
Mercury
informs
him
,
``
Here
's
another
letter
for
*NL*
you
,
Mr.
Bucket
,
come
by
post
,
''
and
gives
it
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
one
,
eh
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mercury
should
chance
to
be
possessed
by
any
lingering
curiosity
*NL*
as
to
Mr.
Bucket
's
letters
,
that
wary
person
is
not
the
man
to
*NL*
gratify
it
.
Mr.
Bucket
looks
at
him
as
if
his
face
were
a
vista
of
*NL*
some
miles
in
length
and
he
were
leisurely
contemplating
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
happen
to
carry
a
box
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
Mercury
is
no
snuff-taker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
fetch
me
a
pinch
from
anywheres
?
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
``
Thankee
.
It
do
n't
matter
what
it
is
;
I
'm
not
particular
as
to
the
*NL*
kind
.
Thankee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
leisurely
helped
himself
from
a
canister
borrowed
from
*NL*
somebody
downstairs
for
the
purpose
,
and
having
made
a
considerable
*NL*
show
of
tasting
it
,
first
with
one
side
of
his
nose
and
then
with
the
*NL*
other
,
Mr.
Bucket
,
with
much
deliberation
,
pronounces
it
of
the
right
*NL*
sort
and
goes
on
,
letter
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
although
Mr.
Bucket
walks
upstairs
to
the
little
library
within
*NL*
the
larger
one
with
the
face
of
a
man
who
receives
some
scores
of
*NL*
letters
every
day
,
it
happens
that
much
correspondence
is
not
*NL*
incidental
to
his
life
.
He
is
no
great
scribe
,
rather
handling
his
*NL*
pen
like
the
pocket-staff
he
carries
about
with
him
always
convenient
*NL*
to
his
grasp
,
and
discourages
correspondence
with
himself
in
others
*NL*
as
being
too
artless
and
direct
a
way
of
doing
delicate
business
.
*NL*
Further
,
he
often
sees
damaging
letters
produced
in
evidence
and
has
*NL*
occasion
to
reflect
that
it
was
a
green
thing
to
write
them
.
For
*NL*
these
reasons
he
has
very
little
to
do
with
letters
,
either
as
sender
*NL*
or
receiver
.
And
yet
he
has
received
a
round
half-dozen
within
the
*NL*
last
twenty-four
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
spreading
it
out
on
the
table
,
``
is
in
*NL*
the
same
hand
,
and
consists
of
the
same
two
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
two
words
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
turns
the
key
in
the
door
,
ungirdles
his
black
pocket-book
-LRB-
book
*NL*
of
fate
to
many
-RRB-
,
lays
another
letter
by
it
,
and
reads
,
boldly
*NL*
written
in
each
,
``
Lady
Dedlock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
But
I
could
have
made
the
money
without
*NL*
this
anonymous
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
put
the
letters
in
his
book
of
fate
and
girdled
it
up
again
,
*NL*
he
unlocks
the
door
just
in
time
to
admit
his
dinner
,
which
is
*NL*
brought
upon
a
goodly
tray
with
a
decanter
of
sherry
.
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
frequently
observes
,
in
friendly
circles
where
there
is
no
restraint
,
*NL*
that
he
likes
a
toothful
of
your
fine
old
brown
East
Inder
sherry
*NL*
better
than
anything
you
can
offer
him
.
Consequently
he
fills
and
*NL*
empties
his
glass
with
a
smack
of
his
lips
and
is
proceeding
with
his
*NL*
refreshment
when
an
idea
enters
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
softly
opens
the
door
of
communication
between
that
room
*NL*
and
the
next
and
looks
in
.
The
library
is
deserted
,
and
the
fire
is
*NL*
sinking
low
.
Mr.
Bucket
's
eye
,
after
taking
a
pigeon-flight
round
the
*NL*
room
,
alights
upon
a
table
where
letters
are
usually
put
as
they
*NL*
arrive
.
Several
letters
for
Sir
Leicester
are
upon
it
.
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
draws
near
and
examines
the
directions
.
``
No
,
''
he
says
,
``
there
's
none
*NL*
in
that
hand
.
It
's
only
me
as
is
written
to
.
I
can
break
it
to
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
returns
to
finish
his
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
,
and
*NL*
after
a
light
nap
,
is
summoned
into
the
drawing-room
.
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
has
received
him
there
these
several
evenings
past
to
know
whether
he
*NL*
has
anything
to
report
.
The
debilitated
cousin
-LRB-
much
exhausted
by
the
*NL*
funeral
-RRB-
and
Volumnia
are
in
attendance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
makes
three
distinctly
different
bows
to
these
three
*NL*
people
.
A
bow
of
homage
to
Sir
Leicester
,
a
bow
of
gallantry
to
*NL*
Volumnia
,
and
a
bow
of
recognition
to
the
debilitated
Cousin
,
to
whom
*NL*
it
airily
says
,
``
You
are
a
swell
about
town
,
and
you
know
me
,
and
I
*NL*
know
you
.
''
Having
distributed
these
little
specimens
of
his
tact
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
rubs
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
anything
new
to
communicate
,
officer
?
''
inquires
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
.
``
Do
you
wish
to
hold
any
conversation
with
me
in
private
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
not
to-night
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
my
time
,
''
pursues
Sir
Leicester
,
``
is
wholly
at
your
disposal
*NL*
with
a
view
to
the
vindication
of
the
outraged
majesty
of
the
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
coughs
and
glances
at
Volumnia
,
rouged
and
necklaced
,
as
*NL*
though
he
would
respectfully
observe
,
``
I
do
assure
you
,
you
're
a
*NL*
pretty
creetur
.
I
've
seen
hundreds
worse
looking
at
your
time
of
*NL*
life
,
I
have
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fair
Volumnia
,
not
quite
unconscious
perhaps
of
the
humanizing
*NL*
influence
of
her
charms
,
pauses
in
the
writing
of
cocked-hat
notes
*NL*
and
meditatively
adjusts
the
pearl
necklace
.
Mr.
Bucket
prices
that
*NL*
decoration
in
his
mind
and
thinks
it
as
likely
as
not
that
Volumnia
*NL*
is
writing
poetry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
not
,
''
pursues
Sir
Leicester
,
``
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
,
*NL*
adjured
you
,
officer
,
to
exercise
your
utmost
skill
in
this
atrocious
*NL*
case
,
I
particularly
desire
to
take
the
present
opportunity
of
*NL*
rectifying
any
omission
I
may
have
made
.
Let
no
expense
be
a
*NL*
consideration
.
I
am
prepared
to
defray
all
charges
.
You
can
incur
*NL*
none
in
pursuit
of
the
object
you
have
undertaken
that
I
shall
*NL*
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
made
Sir
Leicester
's
bow
again
as
a
response
to
this
*NL*
liberality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mind
,
''
Sir
Leicester
adds
with
a
generous
warmth
,
``
has
not
,
as
*NL*
may
be
easily
supposed
,
recovered
its
tone
since
the
late
diabolical
*NL*
occurrence
.
It
is
not
likely
ever
to
recover
its
tone
.
But
it
is
full
*NL*
of
indignation
to-night
after
undergoing
the
ordeal
of
consigning
to
*NL*
the
tomb
the
remains
of
a
faithful
,
a
zealous
,
a
devoted
adherent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
's
voice
trembles
and
his
grey
hair
stirs
upon
his
head
.
*NL*
Tears
are
in
his
eyes
;
the
best
part
of
his
nature
is
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
,
''
he
says
,
``
I
solemnly
declare
that
until
this
crime
is
*NL*
discovered
and
,
in
the
course
of
justice
,
punished
,
I
almost
feel
as
*NL*
if
there
were
a
stain
upon
my
name
.
A
gentleman
who
has
devoted
a
*NL*
large
portion
of
his
life
to
me
,
a
gentleman
who
has
devoted
the
last
*NL*
day
of
his
life
to
me
,
a
gentleman
who
has
constantly
sat
at
my
table
*NL*
and
slept
under
my
roof
,
goes
from
my
house
to
his
own
,
and
is
struck
*NL*
down
within
an
hour
of
his
leaving
my
house
.
I
can
not
say
but
that
he
*NL*
may
have
been
followed
from
my
house
,
watched
at
my
house
,
even
first
*NL*
marked
because
of
his
association
with
my
house
--
which
may
have
*NL*
suggested
his
possessing
greater
wealth
and
being
altogether
of
*NL*
greater
importance
than
his
own
retiring
demeanour
would
have
*NL*
indicated
.
If
I
can
not
with
my
means
and
influence
and
my
position
*NL*
bring
all
the
perpetrators
of
such
a
crime
to
light
,
I
fail
in
the
*NL*
assertion
of
my
respect
for
that
gentleman
's
memory
and
of
my
*NL*
fidelity
towards
one
who
was
ever
faithful
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
makes
this
protestation
with
great
emotion
and
earnestness
,
*NL*
looking
round
the
room
as
if
he
were
addressing
an
assembly
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
glances
at
him
with
an
observant
gravity
in
which
there
might
*NL*
be
,
but
for
the
audacity
of
the
thought
,
a
touch
of
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ceremony
of
to-day

continues
Sir
Leicester
,
``
strikingly
*NL*
illustrative

lays

I

received
from

most
horrible

audacious

If

I

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

looks
very
grave

Volumnia
remarks
of
the
deceased
that
he
*NL*
was
the
trustiest
and
dearest

!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

feel
it

replies
Mr.

*NL*
soothingly
,
``
no

He
was
calculated

I
'm
*NL*
sure
he
was

*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
gives
Mr.
Bucket
to
understand
,
in
reply
,
that
her
sensitive
*NL*
mind
is
fully
made
up
never
to
get
the
better
of
it
as
long
as
she
*NL*
lives
,
that
her
nerves
are
unstrung
for
ever
,
and
that
she
has
not
*NL*
the
least
expectation
of
ever
smiling
again
.
Meanwhile
she
folds
up
a
*NL*
cocked
hat
for
that
redoubtable
old
general
at
Bath
,
descriptive
of
*NL*
her
melancholy
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gives
a
start
to

says
Mr.

*NL*
sympathetically
,
``

it
'll
wear
off

''
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
wishes
of
all

to
know
what
is
doing
?
Whether
they
are
*NL*
going
to
convict
,
or
whatever
it
is

that
dreadful
soldier
?
Whether
*NL*
he
had
any
accomplices

whatever
the

is
called
in
the

And
a

more
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

''
returns
Mr.

,
bringing
the
finger
into
*NL*
persuasive
action
--
and
such
is
his
natural
gallantry
that
he
had
*NL*
almost
said
``

``

*NL*
Volumnia
with

explains
that

the

curiosity

*NL*
The

who
has
been
casting
sofa-pillows
on
his

in
a

prostration

yawns

used-up

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

deeming
it
time

here

majestically
interposes
with

words

``
Very

also
with
a
wave
of
his

implying
not

that
there
is
an
end

of
the
discourse

that
if

fall
into
low
habits

must
take
the
consequences

Mr.

makes
his

three
bows

is
withdrawing

a
forgotten
point
occurs
to
him

``

sees
none

the

having
been
put
up

taken
down

Repeating
his
three
bows
he
withdraws

closing
the
*NL*
door
on
Volumnia
's
little
scream

which
is
a
preliminary

the
turn

with

stretches
his

Come
the

violent
ringing
at

Still

very
pale

she
is
dressed

wears
two
beautiful

Either

rattles
something
in
his
pocket
--
halfpence
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
him
at
his
distance
,
she
turns
an
inquiring
look
on
the
*NL*
other
Mercury
who
has
brought
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
makes
a
leg
and
comes
forward
,
passing
his
familiar
demon
*NL*
over
the
region
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
waiting
to
see

*NL*
``
No

*NL*
This
is
merely
in
passing

She
scarcely
makes
a
stop
,
and
sweeps
*NL*
upstairs
alone
.
Mr.
Bucket
,
moving
towards
the
staircase-foot
,
*NL*
watches
her
as
she
goes
up
the
steps
the
old
man
came
down
to
his
*NL*
grave
,
past
murderous
groups
of
statuary
repeated
with
their
shadowy
*NL*
weapons
on
the
wall
,
past
the
printed
bill
,
which
she
looks
at
going
*NL*
by
,
out
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
lovely
woman
,
too

she
really
is

says
Mr.
Bucket
,
coming
*NL*
back
to
Mercury
.
``
Do
n't

quite
healthy

*NL*
*NL*
Is
not
quite
healthy

Mercury
informs
him

Suffers
much
from
*NL*
headaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Really
?
That
's
a
pity
!
Walking
,
Mr.
Bucket
would
recommend
for
that
.
*NL*
Well
,
she
tries
walking

Mercury
rejoins
.
Walks
sometimes
for
two
*NL*
hours
when
she
has
them
bad

By
night
,
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

sure

asks
Mr.

Begging

Not

about
it

*NL*

*NL*
Oh

Conversational

Mr.

warming

pleasantly
at

Mr.

must
return

a
little
work

on

upstairs

CHAPTER
LIV
*NL*
*NL*
Springing
a
Mine
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Refreshed
by
sleep
,
Mr.
Bucket
rises
betimes
in
the
morning
and
*NL*
prepares
for
a
field-day
.
Smartened
up
by
the
aid
of
a
clean
shirt
*NL*
and
a
wet
hairbrush
,
with
which
instrument
,
on
occasions
of
ceremony
,
*NL*
he
lubricates
such
thin
locks
as
remain
to
him
after
his
life
of
*NL*
severe
study
,
Mr.
Bucket
lays
in
a
breakfast
of
two
mutton
chops
as
a
*NL*
foundation
to
work
upon
,
together
with
tea
,
eggs
,
toast
,
and
*NL*
marmalade
on
a
corresponding
scale
.
Having
much
enjoyed
these
*NL*
strengthening
matters
and
having
held
subtle
conference
with
his
*NL*
familiar
demon
,
he
confidently
instructs
Mercury
``
just
to
mention
*NL*
quietly
to
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
that
whenever
he
's
ready
*NL*
for
me
,
I
'm
ready
for
him
.
''
A
gracious
message
being
returned
that
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
will
expedite
his
dressing
and
join
Mr.
Bucket
in
the
*NL*
library
within
ten
minutes
,
Mr.
Bucket
repairs
to
that
apartment
and
*NL*
stands
before
the
fire
with
his
finger
on
his
chin
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
blazing
coals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoughtful
Mr.
Bucket
is
,
as
a
man
may
be
with
weighty
work
to
do
,
*NL*
but
composed
,
sure
,
confident
.
From
the
expression
of
his
face
he
*NL*
might
be
a
famous
whist-player
for
a
large
stake
--
say
a
hundred
*NL*
guineas
certain
--
with
the
game
in
his
hand
,
but
with
a
high
*NL*
reputation
involved
in
his
playing
his
hand
out
to
the
last
card
in
a
*NL*
masterly
way
.
Not
in
the
least
anxious
or
disturbed
is
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
when
Sir
Leicester
appears
,
but
he
eyes
the
baronet
aside
as
he
comes
*NL*
slowly
to
his
easy-chair
with
that
observant
gravity
of
yesterday
in
*NL*
which
there
might
have
been
yesterday
,
but
for
the
audacity
of
the
*NL*
idea
,
a
touch
of
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
,
officer
,
but
I
am
rather
later
*NL*
than
my
usual
hour
this
morning
.
I
am
not
well
.
The
agitation
and
the
*NL*
indignation
from
which
I
have
recently
suffered
have
been
too
much
*NL*
for
me
.
I
am
subject
to
--
gout
''
--
Sir
Leicester
was
going
to
say
*NL*
indisposition
and
would
have
said
it
to
anybody
else
,
but
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
palpably
knows
all
about
it
--
``
and
recent
circumstances
have
brought
*NL*
it
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
takes
his
seat
with
some
difficulty
and
with
an
air
of
pain
,
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
draws
a
little
nearer
,
standing
with
one
of
his
large
*NL*
hands
on
the
library-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
aware
,
officer
,
''
Sir
Leicester
observes
;
raising
his
eyes
*NL*
to
his
face
,
``
whether
you
wish
us
to
be
alone
,
but
that
is
entirely
*NL*
as
you
please
.
If
you
do
,
well
and
good
.
If
not
,
Miss
Dedlock
would
*NL*
be
interested

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

Baronet

returns
Mr.
Bucket
with
his
*NL*
head
persuasively
on
one
side
and
his
forefinger
pendant
at
one
ear
*NL*
like
an
earring
,
``
we
ca
n't
be
too
private
just
at

You
will
*NL*
presently
see
that

A

under
the

circumstances
,

especially
in
Miss
Dedlock
's
elevated
station
of
*NL*
society

but
be
agreeable
to
me
,
but
speaking
without
a
view
to

myself
,
I
will
take
the
liberty
of
assuring
you
that
I
know
we
ca

private

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
enough

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
so
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

Baronet
,
''
Mr.
Bucket
resumes
,
*NL*
``
that
I
was
on
the
point
of
asking
your
permission
to
turn
the
key
in
*NL*
the
door

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
.
''
Mr.
Bucket
skilfully
and
softly
takes
that
*NL*
precaution
,
stooping
on
his
knee
for
a
moment
from
mere
force
of
*NL*
habit
so
to
adjust
the
key
in
the
lock
as
that
no
one
shall
peep
in
*NL*
from
the
outerside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet

I
mentioned
yesterday
evening
that
I

wanted

a
very
little
to
complete
this
case

I
have
now
completed
*NL*
it

collected
proof
against

did
this
crime

``
Against

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
looks
astounded
and
inquires
,
``
Is
the
man
in
custody

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
tells
him
,
after
a
pause
,
``
It
was
a
woman

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
leans
back
in
his
chair
,
and
breathlessly
ejaculates
,
*NL*
``
Good

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

Mr.

begins
,
standing
*NL*
over
him
with
one
hand
spread
out
on
the
library-table
and
the
*NL*
forefinger
of
the
other
in
impressive
use
,
``
it
's
my
duty
to
prepare
*NL*
you
for
a
train
of
circumstances
that
may
,
and
I
go
so
far
as
to
say
*NL*
that
will
,
give
you
a
shock

But
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

Baronet
,
you
*NL*
are
a
gentleman

and
I
know
what
a
gentleman
is

what

capable

A

bear

come

boldly
*NL*

steadily

A
gentleman
can
make
up

any

If
there
's
a
blow

you
naturally

ask

Julius
Caesar

not

go
beyond
him

borne

blow

have
borne
it
well

and
*NL*
you
bear
it
well
on
their
accounts
,
and
to
maintain
the
family
*NL*
credit

That
's
the
way
you
argue

you
act

Leicester
Dedlock

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

leaning
back
in

grasping
the

*NL*
sits
looking
at

with
a
stony
face

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

proceeds
Mr.

,
``
thus

Glancing
at

the
angry
eyes
which
now
avoid
him
and
at
the
angry
figure
trembling
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
,
yet
striving
to
be
still
,
Mr.
Bucket
feels
his
way
*NL*
with
his
forefinger
and
in
a
low
voice
proceeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaims
Sir

,
striking
his

hand
upon
the
table
.
But
in
the
very
heat
and
fury
of
the
act
he
*NL*
stops
,
fixed
by
the
knowing
eyes
of
Mr.

,
whose
forefinger
is
*NL*
slowly
going
and
who
,
with
mingled
confidence

shakes
*NL*
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

ca

quite
take

But
I
know
from

that

suspected

of
having
discovered
,
through
the

sight
of
some
handwriting
--
in
this
very
house
,
and
when
you
yourself
,
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
were
present
--
the
existence
,
in
great
poverty
,
*NL*
of
a
certain
person
who
had
been
her
lover
before
you
courted
her
and
*NL*
who
ought
to
have
been
her
husband
.
''
Mr.
Bucket
stops
and
*NL*
deliberately
repeats
,
``
Ought
to
have
been
her
husband
,
not
a
doubt
*NL*
about
it
.
I
know
from
his
lips
that
when
that
person
soon
afterwards
*NL*
died
,
he
suspected
Lady
Dedlock
of
visiting
his
wretched
lodging
and
*NL*
his
wretched
grave
,
alone
and
in
secret
.
I
know
from
my
own
inquiries
*NL*
and
through
my
eyes
and
ears
that
Lady
Dedlock
did
make
such
visit
in
*NL*
the
dress
of
her
own
maid
,
for
the
deceased
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
employed
*NL*
me
to
reckon
up
her
ladyship
--
if
you
'll
excuse
my
making
use
of
the
*NL*
term
we
commonly
employ
--
and
I
reckoned
her
up
,
so
far
,
completely
.
I
*NL*
confronted
the
maid
in
the
chambers
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
with
a
*NL*
witness
who
had
been
Lady
Dedlock
's
guide
,
and
there
could
n't
be
the
*NL*
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
she
had
worn
the
young
woman
's
dress
,
unknown
*NL*
to
her
.
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
I
did
endeavour
to
pave
the
*NL*
way
a
little
towards
these
unpleasant
disclosures
yesterday
by
saying
*NL*
that
very
strange
things
happened
even
in
high
families
sometimes
.
*NL*
All
this
,
and
more
,
has
happened
in
your
own
family
,
and
to
and
*NL*
through
your
own
Lady
.
It
's
my
belief
that
the
deceased
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
followed
up
these
inquiries
to
the
hour
of
his
death
and
*NL*
that
he
and
Lady
Dedlock
even
had
bad
blood
between
them
upon
the
*NL*
matter
that
very
night
.
Now
,
only
you
put
that
to
Lady
Dedlock
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
and
ask
her
ladyship
whether
,
even
after
*NL*
he
had
left
here
,
she
did
n't
go
down
to
his
chambers
with
the
*NL*
intention
of
saying
something
further
to
him
,
dressed
in
a
loose
*NL*
black
mantle
with
a
deep
fringe
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
sits
like
a
statue
,
gazing
at
the
cruel
finger
that
is
*NL*
probing
the
life-blood
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

And
if
her

makes
any
*NL*
difficulty
about
admitting
of
it
,
you
tell
her
that
it
's
no
use
,
that
*NL*
Inspector
Bucket
knows
it
and
knows
that
she
passed
the
soldier

you
called
him

he
's
not
in
the
army
now

passed
him
on
the
staircase

Now
,
Sir

Dedlock
,
*NL*
Baronet
,
why
do
I
relate
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
,
who
has
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
,
uttering
a
*NL*
single
groan
,
requests
him
to
pause
for
a
moment
.
By
and
by
he
takes
*NL*
his
hands
away
,
and
so
preserves
his
dignity
and
outward
calmness
,
*NL*
though
there
is
no
more
colour
in
his
face
than
in
his
white
hair
,
*NL*
that
Mr.
Bucket
is
a
little
awed
by
him
.
Something
frozen
and
fixed
*NL*
is
upon
his
manner
,
over
and
above
its
usual
shell
of
haughtiness
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Bucket
soon
detects
an
unusual
slowness
in
his
speech
,
with
*NL*
now
and
then
a
curious
trouble
in
beginning
,
which
occasions
him
to
*NL*
utter
inarticulate
sounds
.
With
such
sounds
he
now
breaks
silence
,
*NL*
soon
,
however
,
controlling
himself
to
say
that
he
does
not
comprehend
*NL*
why
a
gentleman
so
faithful
and
zealous
as
the
late
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
*NL*
should
have
communicated
to
him
nothing
of
this
painful
,
this
*NL*
distressing
,
this
unlooked-for
,
this
overwhelming
,
this
incredible
*NL*
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
''
returns
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
put
it
*NL*
to

up

it
right

from

You
'll
find
,
*NL*
or
I
'm
much
mistaken

that
the

had
the
*NL*
intention
of
communicating
the
whole
to

soon

considered

it
ripe

further

that

Why

*NL*
*NL*
True
.
Sir
Leicester
,
avoiding
,
with
some
trouble
those
obtrusive
*NL*
sounds
,
says
,
``
True

''
At
this
juncture
a
considerable
noise
of
voices
*NL*
is
heard
in
the
hall
.
Mr.
Bucket
,
after
listening
,
goes
to
the
*NL*
library-door
,
softly
unlocks
and
opens
it
,
and
listens
again
.
Then
he
*NL*
draws
in
his
head
and
whispers
hurriedly
but
composedly
,
``
Sir
*NL*

being
cut

down

sudden

hush

let
in

now

wrangle
with

footmen

you
mind
sitting
quiet

on
the

while
I
reckon
'em
up

would
you
just
throw
in
a

nod

I
seem
to
ask
you
for
it

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

indistinctly
answers
,
``

and
Mr.
Bucket
,
with
a
nod
and
a
sagacious
crook
of
*NL*
the
forefinger
,
slips
down
into
the
hall
,
where
the
voices
quickly
*NL*
die
away
.
He
is
not
long
in
returning
;
a
few
paces
ahead
of
Mercury
*NL*
and
a
brother
deity
also
powdered
and
in
peach-blossomed
smalls
,
who
*NL*
bear
between
them
a
chair
in
which
is
an
incapable
old
man
.
Another
*NL*
man
and
two
women
come
behind
.
Directing
the
pitching
of
the
chair
in
*NL*
an
affable
and
easy
manner
,
Mr.
Bucket
dismisses
the
Mercuries
and
*NL*
locks
the
door
again
.
Sir

looks
on
at
this
invasion
of
the
*NL*
sacred
precincts
with
an
icy
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

We

If

he

Mr.

instantaneously
altering
his

coming
close

him

communicating
an
extraordinary

fascination
to
the

out

it

*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
dread
power
of
the
man

and
so
terribly
evident
it
is
*NL*
that
he
makes
no
idle
boast

that
Mr.

begins
to
apologize

Mr.

checks
him

The

my

You
keep
half

*NL*
Mr.

looks

with
greedy
eyes
,
at
the
little
bundle
Mr.

Bucket
produces
from
a
mysterious
part
of
his
coat

identifies
it

as
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

asks
Mr.

``
Now

humorously

bows
his

Two
fifty

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

is
quite

Mr.

Lord

Many

that

a
moderate
man
he
*NL*
was
in
all
respects

as
ever
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
invited
,
Mr.
Chadband
steps
forth
,
and
after
a
little
sleek
*NL*
smiling
and
a
little
oil-grinding
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
,
*NL*
delivers
himself
as
follows
,
``
My

now

Rachael

Why
are
we
now
in

the
mansions
of
the
rich

my

Is
it
because
we

Because

because
we

No

Then

we
in

*NL*
``

returns
Mr.

,
very
*NL*
attentive
,
``

consequently
you
're
going
on

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
then
,
my

in
a

says
Mr.

*NL*
with
a
cunning
eye
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Chadband
,
more
than
ready
,
so
advances
as
to
jostle
her
husband
*NL*
into
the
background
and
confronts
Mr.
Bucket
with
a
hard
,
frowning
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
want
to
know
what
we
know
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
'll
tell
you

I
*NL*
helped

bring
up

I
was
in
the
*NL*
service
of
her
ladyship
's
sister
,
who
was
very
sensitive
to
the
*NL*
disgrace
her
ladyship
brought
upon
her
,
and
gave
out
,
even
to
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
that
the
child
was
dead
--
she
WAS
very
nearly
so
--
when
she
*NL*
was
born
.
But
she
's
alive
,
and
I
know
her
.
''
With
these
words
,
and
a
*NL*
laugh
,
and
laying
a
bitter
stress
on
the
word
``
ladyship
,
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Chadband
folds
her
arms
and
looks
implacably
at
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
now
,
''
returns
that
officer
,
``
YOU
will
be
expecting
a
*NL*
twenty-pound
note
or
a
present
of
about
that
figure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Chadband
merely
laughs
and
contemptuously
tells
him
he
can
*NL*
``
offer
''
twenty
pence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
the
law-stationer
's
good
lady
,
over
there
,
''
says
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
luring
Mrs.
Snagsby
forward
with
the
finger
.
``
What
may
YOUR
*NL*
game
be
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
is
at
first
prevented
,
by
tears
and
lamentations
,
from
*NL*
stating
the
nature
of
her
game
,
but
by
degrees
it
confusedly
comes
to
*NL*
light
that
she
is
a
woman
overwhelmed
with
injuries
and
wrongs
,
whom
*NL*
Mr.
Snagsby
has
habitually
deceived
,
abandoned
,
and
sought
to
keep
in
*NL*
darkness
,
and
whose
chief
comfort
,
under
her
afflictions
,
has
been
*NL*
the
sympathy
of
the
late
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
who
showed
so
much
*NL*
commiseration
for
her
on
one
occasion
of
his
calling
in
Cook
's
Court
*NL*
in
the
absence
of
her
perjured
husband
that
she
has
of
late
*NL*
habitually
carried
to
him
all
her
woes
.
Everybody
it
appears
,
the
*NL*
present
company
excepted
,
has
plotted
against
Mrs.
Snagsby
's
peace
.
*NL*
There
is
Mr.
Guppy
,
clerk
to
Kenge
and
Carboy
,
who
was
at
first
as
*NL*
open
as
the
sun
at
noon
,
but
who
suddenly
shut
up
as
close
as
*NL*
midnight
,
under
the
influence
--
no
doubt
--
of
Mr.
Snagsby
's
suborning
*NL*
and
tampering
.
There
is
Mr.
Weevle
,
friend
of
Mr.
Guppy
,
who
lived
*NL*
mysteriously
up
a
court
,
owing
to
the
like
coherent
causes
.
There
was
*NL*
Krook
,
deceased
;
there
was
Nimrod
,
deceased
;
and
there
was
Jo
,
*NL*
deceased
;
and
they
were
``
all
in
it
.
''
In
what
,
Mrs.
Snagsby
does
not
*NL*
with
particularity
express
,
but
she
knows
that
Jo
was
Mr.
Snagsby
's
*NL*
son
,
``
as
well
as
if
a
trumpet
had
spoken
it
,
''
and
she
followed
Mr.
*NL*
Snagsby
when
he
went
on
his
last
visit
to
the
boy
,
and
if
he
was
not
*NL*
his
son
why
did
he
go
?
The
one
occupation
of
her
life
has
been
,
for
*NL*
some
time
back
,
to
follow
Mr.
Snagsby
to
and
fro
,
and
up
and
down
,
*NL*
and
to
piece
suspicious
circumstances
together
--
and
every
*NL*
circumstance
that
has
happened
has
been
most
suspicious
;
and
in
this
*NL*
way
she
has
pursued
her
object
of
detecting
and
confounding
her
false
*NL*
husband
,
night
and
day
.
Thus
did
it
come
to
pass
that
she
brought
the
*NL*
Chadbands
and
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
together
,
and
conferred
with
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
on
the
change
in
Mr.
Guppy
,
and
helped
to
turn
up
the
*NL*
circumstances
in
which
the
present
company
are
interested
,
casually
,
*NL*
by
the
wayside
,
being
still
and
ever
on
the
great
high
road
that
is
*NL*
to
terminate
in
Mr.
Snagsby
's
full
exposure
and
a
matrimonial
*NL*
separation
.
All
this
,
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
as
an
injured
woman
,
and
the
*NL*
friend
of
Mrs.
Chadband
,
and
the
follower
of
Mr.
Chadband
,
and
the
*NL*
mourner
of
the
late
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
,
is
here
to
certify
under
the
*NL*
seal
of
confidence
,
with
every
possible
confusion
and
involvement
*NL*
possible
and
impossible
,
having
no
pecuniary
motive
whatever
,
no
*NL*
scheme
or
project
but
the
one
mentioned
,
and
bringing
here
,
and
*NL*
taking
everywhere
,
her
own
dense
atmosphere
of
dust
,
arising
from
the
*NL*
ceaseless
working
of
her
mill
of
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
exordium
is
in
hand
--
and
it
takes
some
time
--
Mr.
Bucket
,
*NL*
who
has
seen
through
the
transparency
of
Mrs.
Snagsby
's
vinegar
at
a
*NL*
glance
,
confers
with
his
familiar
demon
and
bestows
his
shrewd
*NL*
attention
on
the
Chadbands
and
Mr.
Smallweed
.
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
*NL*
remains
immovable
,
with
the
same
icy
surface
upon
him
,
except
that
he
*NL*
once
or
twice
looks
towards
Mr.
Bucket
,
as
relying
on
that
officer
*NL*
alone
of
all
mankind

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

says
Mr.

again

mechanically
bows

retire

held
all
these
horses
in
his
hand
and
could
have
drove
'em
his
own
*NL*
way
,
I
have
n't
a
doubt
;
but
he
was
fetched
off
the
box
head-foremost
,
*NL*
and
now
they
have
got
their
legs
over
the
traces
,
and
are
all
*NL*
dragging
and
pulling
their
own
ways
.
So
it
is
,
and
such
is
life
.
The
*NL*
cat
's
away
,
and
the
mice
they
play
;
the
frost
breaks
up
,
and
the
*NL*
water
runs
.
Now
,
with
regard
to
the
party
to
be
apprehended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
seems
to
wake
,
though
his
eyes
have
been
wide
open
,
and
*NL*
he
looks
intently
at
Mr.
Bucket
as
Mr.
Bucket
refers
to
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
party
to
be
apprehended
is
now
in
this
house

''
proceeds
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
putting
up
his
watch
with
a
steady
hand
and
with
rising
*NL*
spirits
,
``
and
I
'm
about
to
take
her
into
custody
in
your

*NL*
Sir

*NL*
There

be

I
'll
come
back
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
evening
,
if
agreeable
to
you

and
endeavour
to
meet
*NL*
your
wishes
respecting
this
unfortunate
family

the

nobbiest
way
of
keeping

quiet

Now
,
Sir

Dedlock
,
*NL*
Baronet
,
do
n't
you
be
nervous
on
account
of
the

coming
off

You
shall
see
the
whole

clear
,
from
first

*NL*
last

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
rings
,
goes
to
the
door
,
briefly
whispers
Mercury
,
shuts
*NL*
the
door
,
and
stands
behind
it
with
his
arms
folded
.
After
a
suspense
*NL*
of
a
minute
or
two
the
door
slowly
opens
and
a
Frenchwoman
enters
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Hortense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
she
is
in
the
room
Mr.
Bucket
claps
the
door
to
and
puts
*NL*
his
back
against
it
.
The
suddenness
of
the
noise
occasions
her
to
*NL*
turn
,
and
then
for
the
first
time
she
sees
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
in
*NL*
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
pardon
,
''
she
mutters
hurriedly
.
``
They
tell
me
there
was
no
*NL*
one
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
step
towards
the
door
brings
her
front
to
front
with
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
Suddenly
a
spasm
shoots
across
her
face
and
she
turns
deadly
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
lodger
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

says
Mr.
Bucket
,
nodding
*NL*
at
her
.
``
This
foreign
young

been
my

some
weeks

back

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Sir
Leicester
care
for
that

returns
*NL*
mademoiselle
in
a
jocular
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
angel
,
''
returns
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
we
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Hortense
eyes
him
with
a
scowl
upon
her
tight
face
,
*NL*
which
gradually
changes
into
a
smile
of
scorn
,
``
You
are
very
*NL*
mysterieuse

Are
you
drunk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tolerable

Mr.

*NL*

mademoiselle
*NL*
demands
,
with
her
arms
composedly
crossed
,
but
with
something
in
her
*NL*
dark
cheek
beating
like
a
clock

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

merely
shakes
the
finger
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

my
God

you
are
an
unhappy
idiot

cries
mademoiselle
with
a
*NL*
toss
of
her
head
and
a
laugh
.
``
Leave
me
to
pass
downstairs

great
*NL*
pig

With
a
stamp
of
her
foot
and
a
menace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

mademoiselle

says
Mr.

in
a
cool
determined
way
,
``
you

and
sit
down
upon

sofy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not

she
replies
with
a
shower
of
*NL*
nods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

repeats
Mr.

,
making
no
demonstration
*NL*
except
with
the
finger

``
you
sit
down

sofy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

*NL*
Mademoiselle
complies

saying
in
a
concentrated
voice
while
that
*NL*
something
in
her
cheek
beats
fast

hard
,
``
You

Mr.

proceeds
approvingly

I
'll
give

it

Mr.

is
very
complacent

over

*NL*
Mademoiselle

with
that
tigerish
expansion
of
the
mouth

her
black
*NL*
eyes
darting
fire
upon

sits
upright
on
the
sofa
in

rigid

state

with

hands
clenched

her
feet

*NL*
``

Mr.

from

forth
the
finger
never
rests
,

Mr.

in
an

impressive

almost
in
an
imploring

tone
.

inaugurates

Mademoiselle

fixes

flashed

sat

Can
you
do
without

Can
you

Mrs.

speak

Sir

did
my

come
out

was
I
wrong

Do
n't

To
throw

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
rises
from
his
chair
and
staggers
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
got
encouragement
in
it
from
hearing
that
I
was
always
here
,
*NL*
which
was
done
a-purpose
.
Now
,
open
that
pocket-book
of
mine
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
,
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
of
throwing
it
towards
*NL*
you
,
and
look
at
the
letters
sent
to
me
,
each
with
the
two
words
*NL*
`
Lady
Dedlock
'
in
it
.
Open
the
one
directed
to
yourself
,
which
I
*NL*
stopped
this
very
morning
,
and
read
the
three
words
`
Lady

*NL*
Murderess

in
it

These
letters
have
been
falling
about
like

of

say
now
to
Mrs.

,
within
this
half-hour
,
secured
the
corresponding

ink

paper

half-sheets

not

What
do
you
say
to

having
watched
the
posting
of
'em
every
one
by
this
young
*NL*
woman

Sir

Dedlock
,
Baronet
?
''
Mr.
Bucket
asks
,
triumphant
*NL*
in
his
admiration
of
his
lady
's
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
things
are
especially
observable
as
Mr.
Bucket
proceeds
to
a
*NL*
conclusion
.
First
,
that
he
seems
imperceptibly
to
establish
a
*NL*
dreadful
right
of
property
in
mademoiselle
.
Secondly
,
that
the
very
*NL*
atmosphere
she
breathes
seems
to
narrow
and
contract
about
her
as
if
*NL*
a
close
net
or
a
pall
were
being
drawn
nearer
and
yet
nearer
around
*NL*
her
breathless
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
doubt
that
her
ladyship
was
on
the
spot
at
the
eventful
*NL*
period
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
and
my
foreign
friend
here
saw
her
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
from
the
upper
part
of
the
staircase
.
Her
ladyship
and
*NL*
George
and
my
foreign
friend
were
all
pretty
close
on
one
another
's
*NL*
heels
.
But
that
do
n't
signify
any
more
,
so
I
'll
not
go
into
it
.
I
*NL*
found
the
wadding
of
the
pistol
with
which
the
deceased
Mr.
*NL*
Tulkinghorn
was
shot
.
It
was
a
bit
of
the
printed
description
of
your
*NL*
house
at
Chesney
Wold
.
Not
much
in
that
,
you
'll
say
,
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
,
Baronet
.
No
.
But
when
my
foreign
friend
here
is
so
*NL*
thoroughly
off
her
guard
as
to
think
it
a
safe
time
to
tear
up
the
*NL*
rest
of
that
leaf
,
and
when
Mrs.
Bucket
puts
the
pieces
together
and
*NL*
finds
the
wadding
wanting
,
it
begins
to
look
like
Queer
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
very
long
lies
,
''
mademoiselle
interposes
.
``
You
prose
great
*NL*
deal
.
Is
it
that
you
have
almost
all
finished
,
or
are
you
speaking
*NL*
always
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
''
proceeds
Mr.
Bucket
,
who
delights
*NL*
in
a
full
title
and
does
violence
to
himself
when
he
dispenses
with
*NL*
any
fragment
of
it
,
``
the
last
point
in
the
case
which
I
am
now
going
*NL*
to
mention
shows
the
necessity
of
patience
in
our
business
,
and
never
*NL*
doing
a
thing
in
a
hurry
.
I
watched
this
young
woman
yesterday
*NL*
without
her
knowledge
when
she
was
looking
at
the
funeral
,
in
company
*NL*
with
my
wife
,
who
planned
to
take
her
there
;
and
I
had
so
much
to
*NL*
convict
her
,
and
I
saw
such
an
expression
in
her
face
,
and
my
mind
so
*NL*
rose
against
her
malice
towards
her
ladyship
,
and
the
time
was
*NL*
altogether
such
a
time
for
bringing
down
what
you
may
call
*NL*
retribution
upon
her
,
that
if
I
had
been
a
younger
hand
with
less
*NL*
experience
,
I
should
have
taken
her
,
certain
.
Equally
,
last
night
,
*NL*
when
her
ladyship
,
as
is
so
universally
admired
I
am
sure
,
come
home
*NL*
looking
--
why
,
Lord
,
a
man
might
almost
say
like
Venus
rising
from
the
*NL*
ocean
--
it
was
so
unpleasant
and
inconsistent
to
think
of
her
being
*NL*
charged
with
a
murder
of
which
she
was
innocent
that
I
felt
quite
to
*NL*
want
to
put
an
end
to
the
job
.
What
should
I
have
lost
?
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
I
should
have
lost
the
weapon
.
My
prisoner
here
*NL*
proposed
to
Mrs.
Bucket
,
after
the
departure
of
the
funeral
,
that
*NL*
they
should
go
per
bus
a
little
ways
into
the
country
and
take
tea
at
*NL*
a
very
decent
house
of
entertainment
.
Now
,
near
that
house
of
*NL*
entertainment
there
's
a
piece
of
water
.
At
tea
,
my
prisoner
got
up
to
*NL*
fetch
her
pocket
handkercher
from
the
bedroom
where
the
bonnets
was
;
*NL*
she
was
rather
a
long
time
gone
and
came
back
a
little
out
of
wind
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
came
home
this
was
reported
to
me
by
Mrs.
Bucket
,
*NL*
along
with
her
observations
and
suspicions
.
I
had
the
piece
of
water
*NL*
dragged
by
moonlight
,
in
presence
of
a
couple
of
our
men
,
and
the
*NL*
pocket
pistol
was
brought
up
before
it
had
been
there
half-a-dozen
*NL*
hours
.
Now
,
my
dear
,
put
your
arm
a
little
further
through
mine
,
and
*NL*
hold
it
steady
,
and
I
sha
n't
hurt
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
trice
Mr.
Bucket
snaps
a
handcuff
on
her
wrist
.
``
That
's
one
,
''
*NL*
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Now
the
other

darling

Two

all

*NL*
*NL*
He
rises
;
she
rises
too
.
``
Where
,
''
she
asks
him
,
darkening
her
large
*NL*
eyes
until
their
drooping
lids
almost
conceal
them
--
and
yet
they
*NL*
stare
,
``
where
is
your
false
,
your
treacherous
,
and
cursed
wife

*NL*
``
She

``

would
like

exclaims
Mademoiselle

panting

tigress-like

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Hortense
,
casting
an
indignant
eye
at
the
glass
,
shakes

herself
perfectly
neat
in
one
shake
and
looks

to
do
her
justice

*NL*
uncommonly
genteel

*NL*
``
Listen

angel

says
she
after
several
sarcastic
nods
.
``

very
spiritual

But
can

restore

back

answers

``
Not

``

malicious

says
Mr.

*NL*
``
Or

cries
mademoiselle
,
referring
to
Sir

Leicester
with
ineffable
disdain
.
``
Eh

Oh

then
regard
him

The
poor
*NL*
infant

Ha

Ha

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

is
worse
PARLAYING
than

Mr.

Adieu

*NL*
you
old

grey

I
pity

I
despise

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
last
words
she
snaps
her
teeth
together
as
if
her
mouth
*NL*
closed
with
a
spring
.
It
is
impossible
to
describe
how
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
gets
her
out
,
but
he
accomplishes
that
feat
in
a
manner
so
peculiar
*NL*
to
himself
,
enfolding
and
pervading
her
like
a
cloud
,
and
hovering
*NL*
away
with
her
as
if
he
were
a
homely
Jupiter
and
she
the
object
of
*NL*
his
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
,
left
alone
,
remains
in
the
same
attitude
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
still
listening
and
his
attention
were
still
occupied
.
At
length
*NL*
he
gazes
round
the
empty
room
,
and
finding
it
deserted
,
rises
*NL*
unsteadily
to
his
feet
,
pushes
back
his
chair
,
and
walks
a
few
steps
,
*NL*
supporting
himself
by
the
table
.
Then
he
stops
,
and
with
more
of
*NL*
those
inarticulate
sounds
,
lifts
up
his
eyes
and
seems
to
stare
at
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heaven
knows
what
he
sees
.
The
green
,
green
woods
of
Chesney
Wold
,
*NL*
the
noble
house
,
the
pictures
of
his
forefathers
,
strangers
defacing
*NL*
them
,
officers
of
police
coarsely
handling
his
most
precious
*NL*
heirlooms
,
thousands
of
fingers
pointing
at
him
,
thousands
of
faces
*NL*
sneering
at
him
.
But
if
such
shadows
flit
before
him
to
his
*NL*
bewilderment
,
there
is
one
other
shadow
which
he
can
name
with
*NL*
something
like
distinctness
even
yet
and
to
which
alone
he
addresses
*NL*
his
tearing
of
his
white
hair
and
his
extended
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
she
in
association
with
whom
,
saving
that
she
has
been
for
*NL*
years
a
main
fibre
of
the
root
of
his
dignity
and
pride
,
he
has
never
*NL*
had
a
selfish
thought
.
It
is
she
whom
he
has
loved
,
admired
,
*NL*
honoured
,
and
set
up
for
the
world
to
respect
.
It
is
she
who
,
at
the
*NL*
core
of
all
the
constrained
formalities
and
conventionalities
of
his
*NL*
life
,
has
been
a
stock
of
living
tenderness
and
love
,
susceptible
as
*NL*
nothing
else
is
of
being
struck
with
the
agony
he
feels
.
He
sees
her
,
*NL*
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
himself
,
and
can
not
bear
to
look
upon
her
*NL*
cast
down
from
the
high
place
she
has
graced
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
even
to
the
point
of
his
sinking
on
the
ground
,
oblivious
of
his
*NL*
suffering
,
he
can
yet
pronounce
her
name
with
something
like
*NL*
distinctness
in
the
midst
of
those
intrusive
sounds
,
and
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
mourning
and
compassion
rather
than
reproach
.

CHAPTER
LV
*NL*
*NL*
Flight
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Inspector
Bucket
of
the
Detective
has
not
yet
struck
his
great
blow
,
*NL*
as
just
now
chronicled
,
but
is
yet
refreshing
himself
with
sleep
*NL*
preparatory
to
his
field-day
,
when
through
the
night
and
along
the
*NL*
freezing
wintry
roads
a
chaise
and
pair
comes
out
of
Lincolnshire
,
*NL*
making
its
way
towards
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Railroads
shall
soon
traverse
all
this
country
,
and
with
a
rattle
and
*NL*
a
glare
the
engine
and
train
shall
shoot
like
a
meteor
over
the
wide
*NL*
night-landscape
,
turning
the
moon
paler
;
but
as
yet
such
things
are
*NL*
non-existent
in
these
parts
,
though
not
wholly
unexpected
.
*NL*
Preparations
are
afoot
,
measurements
are
made
,
ground
is
staked
out
.
*NL*
Bridges
are
begun
,
and
their
not
yet
united
piers
desolately
look
at
*NL*
one
another
over
roads
and
streams
like
brick
and
mortar
couples
with
*NL*
an
obstacle
to
their
union
;
fragments
of
embankments
are
thrown
up
*NL*
and
left
as
precipices
with
torrents
of
rusty
carts
and
barrows
*NL*
tumbling
over
them
;
tripods
of
tall
poles
appear
on
hilltops
,
where
*NL*
there
are
rumours
of
tunnels
;
everything
looks
chaotic
and
abandoned
*NL*
in
full
hopelessness
.
Along
the
freezing
roads
,
and
through
the
*NL*
night
,
the
post-chaise
makes
its
way
without
a
railroad
on
its
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
so
many
years
housekeeper
at
Chesney
Wold
,
sits
*NL*
within
the
chaise
;
and
by
her
side
sits
Mrs.
Bagnet
with
her
grey
*NL*
cloak
and
umbrella
.
The
old
girl
would
prefer
the
bar
in
front
,
as
*NL*
being
exposed
to
the
weather
and
a
primitive
sort
of
perch
more
in
*NL*
accordance
with
her
usual
course
of
travelling
,
but
Mrs.
Rouncewell
*NL*
is
too
thoughtful
of
her
comfort
to
admit
of
her
proposing
it
.
The
*NL*
old
lady
can
not
make
enough
of
the
old
girl
.
She
sits
,
in
her
stately
*NL*
manner
,
holding
her
hand
,
and
regardless
of
its
roughness
,
puts
it
*NL*
often
to
her
lips
.
``
You
are
a
mother
,
my
dear
soul
,
''
says
she
many
*NL*
times
,
``
and
you
found
out
my
George
's
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
George
,
''
returns
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
``
was
always
free
with
me
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
and
when
he
said
at
our
house
to
my
Woolwich
that
of
all
the
things
*NL*
my
Woolwich
could
have
to
think
of
when
he
grew
to
be
a
man
,
the
*NL*
comfortablest
would
be
that
he
had
never
brought
a
sorrowful
line
*NL*
into
his
mother
's
face
or
turned
a
hair
of
her
head
grey
,
then
I
felt
*NL*
sure
,
from
his
way
,
that
something
fresh
had
brought
his
own
mother
*NL*
into
his
mind
.
I
had
often
known
him
say
to
me
,
in
past
times
,
that
*NL*
he
had
behaved
bad
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
my
dear
!
''
returns
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
bursting
into
tears
.
``
My
*NL*
blessing
on
him
,
never
!
He
was
always
fond
of
me
,
and
loving
to
me
,
*NL*
was
my
George
!
But
he
had
a
bold
spirit
,
and
he
ran
a
little
wild
and
*NL*
went
for
a
soldier
.
And
I
know
he
waited
at
first
,
in
letting
us
know
*NL*
about
himself
,
till
he
should
rise
to
be
an
officer
;
and
when
he
*NL*
did
n't
rise
,
I
know
he
considered
himself
beneath
us
,
and
would
n't
be
*NL*
a
disgrace
to
us
.
For
he
had
a
lion
heart
,
had
my
George
,
always
from
*NL*
a
baby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
's
hands
stray
about
her
as
of
yore
,
while
she
recalls
,
*NL*
all
in
a
tremble
,
what
a
likely
lad
,
what
a
fine
lad
,
what
a
gay
*NL*
good-humoured
clever
lad
he
was
;
how
they
all
took
to
him
down
at
*NL*
Chesney
Wold
;
how
Sir
Leicester
took
to
him
when
he
was
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
;
how
the
dogs
took
to
him
;
how
even
the
people
who
had
been
*NL*
angry
with
him
forgave
him
the
moment
he
was
gone
,
poor
boy
.
And
now
*NL*
to
see
him
after
all
,
and
in
a
prison
too
!
And
the
broad
stomacher
*NL*
heaves
,
and
the
quaint
upright
old-fashioned
figure
bends
under
its
*NL*
load
of
affectionate
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
with
the
instinctive
skill
of
a
good
warm
heart
,
leaves
*NL*
the
old
housekeeper
to
her
emotions
for
a
little
while
--
not
without
*NL*
passing
the
back
of
her
hand
across
her
own
motherly
eyes
--
and
*NL*
presently
chirps
up
in
her
cheery
manner
,
``
So
I
says
to
George
when
I
*NL*
goes
to
call
him
in
to
tea
-LRB-
he
pretended
to
be
smoking
his
pipe
*NL*
outside
-RRB-
,
`
What
ails
you
this
afternoon
,
George
,
for
gracious
sake
?
I
*NL*
have
seen
all
sorts
,
and
I
have
seen
you
pretty
often
in
season
and
*NL*
out
of
season
,
abroad
and
at
home
,
and
I
never
see
you
so
melancholy
*NL*
penitent
.
'
`
Why
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
'
says
George
,
`
it
's
because
I
AM
*NL*
melancholy
and
penitent
both
,
this
afternoon
,
that
you
see
me
so
.
'
*NL*
`
What
have
you
done
,
old
fellow
?
'
I
says
.
`
Why
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
'
says
*NL*
George
,
shaking
his
head
,
`
what
I
have
done
has
been
done
this
many
a
*NL*
long
year
,
and
is
best
not
tried
to
be
undone
now
.
If
I
ever
get
to
*NL*
heaven
it
wo
n't
be
for
being
a
good
son
to
a
widowed
mother
;
I
say
no
*NL*
more
.
'
Now
,
ma'am
,
when
George
says
to
me
that
it
's
best
not
tried
to
*NL*
be
undone
now
,
I
have
my
thoughts
as
I
have
often
had
before
,
and
I
*NL*
draw
it
out
of
George
how
he
comes
to
have
such
things
on
him
that
*NL*
afternoon
.
Then
George
tells
me
that
he
has
seen
by
chance
,
at
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
office
,
a
fine
old
lady
that
has
brought
his
mother
plain
*NL*
before
him
,
and
he
runs
on
about
that
old
lady
till
he
quite
forgets
*NL*
himself
and
paints
her
picture
to
me
as
she
used
to
be
,
years
upon
*NL*
years
back
.
So
I
says
to
George
when
he
has
done
,
who
is
this
old
*NL*
lady
he
has
seen
?
And
George
tells
me
it
's
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
*NL*
housekeeper
for
more
than
half
a
century
to
the
Dedlock
family
down
*NL*
at
Chesney
Wold
in
Lincolnshire
.
George
has
frequently
told
me
before
*NL*
that
he
's
a
Lincolnshire
man
,
and
I
says
to
my
old
Lignum
that
night
,
*NL*
`
Lignum
,
that
's
his
mother
for
five
and
for-ty
pound
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
Mrs.
Bagnet
now
relates
for
the
twentieth
time
at
least
*NL*
within
the
last
four
hours
.
Trilling
it
out
like
a
kind
of
bird
,
with
*NL*
a
pretty
high
note
,
that
it
may
be
audible
to
the
old
lady
above
the
*NL*
hum
of
the
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
,
and
thank
you
,
''
says
Mrs.
Rouncewell
.
``
Bless
you
,
and
*NL*
thank
you
,
my
worthy
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
heart
!
''
cries
Mrs.
Bagnet
in
the
most
natural
manner
.
``
No
*NL*
thanks
to
me
,
I
am
sure
.
Thanks
to
yourself
,
ma'am
,
for
being
so
*NL*
ready
to
pay
'em
!
And
mind
once
more
,
ma'am
,
what
you
had
best
do
*NL*
on
finding
George
to
be
your
own
son
is
to
make
him
--
for
your
*NL*
sake
--
have
every
sort
of
help
to
put
himself
in
the
right
and
clear
*NL*
himself
of
a
charge
of
which
he
is
as
innocent
as
you
or
me
.
It
wo
n't
*NL*
do
to
have
truth
and
justice
on
his
side
;
he
must
have
law
and
*NL*
lawyers
,
''
exclaims
the
old
girl
,
apparently
persuaded
that
the
latter
*NL*
form
a
separate
establishment
and
have
dissolved
partnership
with
*NL*
truth
and
justice
for
ever
and
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
have
,
''
says
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
``
all
the
help
that
can
be
got
*NL*
for
him
in
the
world
,
my
dear
.
I
will
spend
all
I
have
,
and
*NL*
thankfully
,
to
procure
it
.
Sir
Leicester
will
do
his
best
,
the
whole
*NL*
family
will
do
their
best
.
I
--
I
know
something
,
my
dear
;
and
will
*NL*
make
my
own
appeal
,
as
his
mother
parted
from
him
all
these
years
,
*NL*
and
finding
him
in
a
jail
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
extreme
disquietude
of
the
old
housekeeper
's
manner
in
saying
*NL*
this
,
her
broken
words
,
and
her
wringing
of
her
hands
make
a
powerful
*NL*
impression
on
Mrs.
Bagnet
and
would
astonish
her
but
that
she
refers
*NL*
them
all
to
her
sorrow
for
her
son
's
condition
.
And
yet
Mrs.
Bagnet
*NL*
wonders
too
why
Mrs.
Rouncewell
should
murmur
so
distractedly
,
``
My
*NL*
Lady
,
my
Lady
,
my
Lady
!
''
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
frosty
night
wears
away
,
and
the
dawn
breaks
,
and
the
post-chaise
*NL*
comes
rolling
on
through
the
early
mist
like
the
ghost
of
a
chaise
*NL*
departed
.
It
has
plenty
of
spectral
company
in
ghosts
of
trees
and
*NL*
hedges
,
slowly
vanishing
and
giving
place
to
the
realities
of
day
.
*NL*
London
reached
,
the
travellers
alight
,
the
old
housekeeper
in
great
*NL*
tribulation
and
confusion
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
quite
fresh
and
collected
--
as
*NL*
she
would
be
if
her
next
point
,
with
no
new
equipage
and
outfit
,
were
*NL*
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
the
Island
of
Ascension
,
Hong
Kong
,
or
any
*NL*
other
military
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
they
set
out
for
the
prison
where
the
trooper
is
*NL*
confined
,
the
old
lady
has
managed
to
draw
about
her
,
with
her
*NL*
lavender-coloured
dress
,
much
of
the
staid
calmness
which
is
its
*NL*
usual
accompaniment
.
A
wonderfully
grave
,
precise
,
and
handsome
piece
*NL*
of
old
china
she
looks
,
though
her
heart
beats
fast
and
her
stomacher
*NL*
is
ruffled
more
than
even
the
remembrance
of
this
wayward
son
has
*NL*
ruffled
it
these
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Approaching
the
cell
,
they
find
the
door
opening
and
a
warder
in
the
*NL*
act
of
coming
out
.
The
old
girl
promptly
makes
a
sign
of
entreaty
to
*NL*
him
to
say
nothing
;
assenting
with
a
nod
,
he
suffers
them
to
enter
as
*NL*
he
shuts
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
George
,
who
is
writing
at
his
table
,
supposing
himself
to
be
*NL*
alone
,
does
not
raise
his
eyes
,
but
remains
absorbed
.
The
old
*NL*
housekeeper
looks
at
him
,
and
those
wandering
hands
of
hers
are
quite
*NL*
enough
for
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
confirmation
,
even
if
she
could
see
the
*NL*
mother
and
the
son
together
,
knowing
what
she
knows
,
and
doubt
their
*NL*
relationship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
rustle
of
the
housekeeper
's
dress
,
not
a
gesture
,
not
a
word
*NL*
betrays
her
.
She
stands
looking
at
him
as
he
writes
on
,
all
*NL*
unconscious
,
and
only
her
fluttering
hands
give
utterance
to
her
*NL*
emotions
.
But
they
are
very
eloquent
,
very
,
very
eloquent
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bagnet
understands
them
.
They
speak
of
gratitude
,
of
joy
,
of
grief
,
*NL*
of
hope
;
of
inextinguishable
affection
,
cherished
with
no
return
*NL*
since
this
stalwart
man
was
a
stripling
;
of
a
better
son
loved
less
,
*NL*
and
this
son
loved
so
fondly
and
so
proudly
;
and
they
speak
in
such
*NL*
touching
language
that
Mrs.
Bagnet
's
eyes
brim
up
with
tears
and
they
*NL*
run
glistening
down
her
sun-brown
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
Rouncewell
!
Oh
,
my
dear
child
,
turn
and
look
at
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
starts
up
,
clasps
his
mother
round
the
neck
,
and
falls
*NL*
down
on
his
knees
before
her
.
Whether
in
a
late
repentance
,
whether
*NL*
in
the
first
association
that
comes
back
upon
him
,
he
puts
his
hands
*NL*
together
as
a
child
does
when
it
says
its
prayers
,
and
raising
them
*NL*
towards
her
breast
,
bows
down
his
head
,
and
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
George
,
my
dearest
son
!
Always
my
favourite
,
and
my
favourite
*NL*
still
,
where
have
you
been
these
cruel
years
and
years
?
Grown
such
a
*NL*
man
too
,
grown
such
a
fine
strong
man
.
Grown
so
like
what
I
knew
he
*NL*
must
be
,
if
it
pleased
God
he
was
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
can
ask
,
and
he
can
answer
,
nothing
connected
for
a
time
.
All
*NL*
that
time
the
old
girl
,
turned
away
,
leans
one
arm
against
the
*NL*
whitened
wall
,
leans
her
honest
forehead
upon
it
,
wipes
her
eyes
with
*NL*
her
serviceable
grey
cloak
,
and
quite
enjoys
herself
like
the
best
of
*NL*
old
girls
as
she
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
says
the
trooper
when
they
are
more
composed
,
``
forgive
me
*NL*
first
of
all
,
for
I
know
my
need
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Forgive
him
!
She
does
it
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
.
She
always
has
*NL*
done
it
.
She
tells
him
how
she
has
had
it
written
in
her
will
,
these
*NL*
many
years
,
that
he
was
her
beloved
son
George
.
She
has
never
*NL*
believed
any
ill
of
him
,
never
.
If
she
had
died
without
this
*NL*
happiness
--
and
she
is
an
old
woman
now
and
ca
n't
look
to
live
very
*NL*
long
--
she
would
have
blessed
him
with
her
last
breath
,
if
she
had
had
*NL*
her
senses
,
as
her
beloved
son
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
have
been
an
undutiful
trouble
to
you
,
and
I
have
my
*NL*
reward
;
but
of
late
years
I
have
had
a
kind
of
glimmering
of
a
*NL*
purpose
in
me
too
.
When
I
left
home
I
did
n't
care
much
,
mother
--
I
am
*NL*
afraid
not
a
great
deal
--
for
leaving
;
and
went
away
and
`
listed
,
*NL*
harum-scarum
,
making
believe
to
think
that
I
cared
for
nobody
,
no
not
*NL*
I
,
and
that
nobody
cared
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
has
dried
his
eyes
and
put
away
his
handkerchief
,
but
*NL*
there
is
an
extraordinary
contrast
between
his
habitual
manner
of
*NL*
expressing
himself
and
carrying
himself
and
the
softened
tone
in
*NL*
which
he
speaks
,
interrupted
occasionally
by
a
half-stifled
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
wrote
a
line
home
,
mother
,
as
you
too
well
know
,
to
say
I
had
*NL*
`
listed
under
another
name
,
and
I
went
abroad
.
Abroad
,
at
one
time
I
*NL*
thought
I
would
write
home
next
year
,
when
I
might
be
better
off
;
and
*NL*
when
that
year
was
out
,
I
thought
I
would
write
home
next
year

when
*NL*
I
might
be
better
off
;
and
when
that
year
was
out
again
,
perhaps
I
*NL*
did
n't
think
much
about
it
.
So
on
,
from
year
to
year
,
through
a
*NL*
service
of
ten
years
,
till
I
began
to
get
older

and
to
ask
myself
*NL*
why
should
I
ever
write

I
do

find
any

growing
older

*NL*
*NL*
This
almost
overturns
the
trooper
afresh
,
but
he
sets
himself
up
with
*NL*
a
great
,
rough
,
sounding
clearance
of
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forgive
me
,
mother
,
but
I
thought
there
would
be
small
*NL*
consolation
then
in
hearing
anything
about
me
.
There
were
you
,
*NL*
respected
and
esteemed
.
There
was
my
brother
,
as
I
read
in
chance
*NL*
North
Country
papers
now
and
then
,
rising
to
be
prosperous
and
*NL*
famous
.
There
was
I
a
dragoon
,
roving
,
unsettled
,
not
self-made
like
*NL*
him
,
but
self-unmade
--
all
my
earlier
advantages
thrown
away
,
all
my
*NL*
little
learning
unlearnt
,
nothing
picked
up
but
what
unfitted
me
for
*NL*
most
things
that
I
could
think
of
.
What
business
had
I
to
make
myself
*NL*
known
?
After
letting
all
that
time
go
by
me
,
what
good
could
come
of
*NL*
it
?
The
worst
was
past
with
you
,
mother
.
I
knew
by
that
time
-LRB-
being
a
*NL*
man
-RRB-
how
you
had
mourned
for
me
,
and
wept
for
me
,
and
prayed
for
me
;
*NL*
and
the
pain
was
over
,
or
was
softened
down
,
and
I
was
better
in
your
*NL*
mind
as
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
sorrowfully
shakes
her
head
,
and
taking
one
of
his
*NL*
powerful
hands
,
lays
it
lovingly
upon
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
say
that
it
was
so
,
mother
,
but
that
I
made
it
out
to
be
*NL*
so
.
I
said
just
now
,
what
good
could
come
of
it
?
Well
,
my
dear
*NL*
mother
,
some
good
might
have
come
of
it
to
myself
--
and
there
was
the
*NL*
meanness
of
it
.
You
would
have
sought
me
out
;
you
would
have
*NL*
purchased
my
discharge
;
you
would
have
taken
me
down
to
Chesney
Wold
;
*NL*
you
would
have
brought
me
and
my
brother
and
my
brother
's
family
*NL*
together
;
you
would
all
have
considered
anxiously
how
to
do
something
*NL*
for
me
and
set
me
up
as
a
respectable
civilian
.
But
how
could
any
of
*NL*
you
feel
sure
of
me
when
I
could
n't
so
much
as
feel
sure
of
myself
?
*NL*
How
could
you
help
regarding
as
an
incumbrance
and
a
discredit
to
you
*NL*
an
idle
dragooning
chap
who
was
an
incumbrance
and
a
discredit
to
*NL*
himself
,
excepting
under
discipline
?
How
could
I
look
my
brother
's
*NL*
children
in
the
face
and
pretend
to
set
them
an
example
--
I
,
the
*NL*
vagabond
boy
who
had
run
away
from
home
and
been
the
grief
and
*NL*
unhappiness
of
my
mother
's
life
?
`
No
,
George
.
'
Such
were
my
words
,
*NL*
mother
,
when
I
passed
this
in
review
before
me
:
`
You
have
made
your
*NL*
bed
.
Now
,
lie
upon
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
drawing
up
her
stately
form
,
shakes
her
head
at
the
*NL*
old
girl
with
a
swelling
pride
upon
her
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
I
told
*NL*
you
so
!
''
The
old
girl
relieves
her
feelings
and
testifies
her
*NL*
interest
in
the
conversation
by
giving
the
trooper
a
great
poke
*NL*
between
the
shoulders
with
her
umbrella
;
this
action
she
afterwards
*NL*
repeats
,
at
intervals
,
in
a
species
of
affectionate
lunacy
,
never
*NL*
failing
,
after
the
administration
of
each
of
these
remonstrances
,
to
*NL*
resort
to
the
whitened
wall
and
the
grey
cloak
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
the
way
I
brought
myself
to
think
,
mother
,
that
my
best
*NL*
amends
was
to
lie
upon
that
bed
I
had
made
,
and
die
upon
it
.
And
I
*NL*
should
have
done
it
-LRB-
though
I
have
been
to
see
you
more
than
once
*NL*
down
at
Chesney
Wold
,
when
you
little
thought
of
me
-RRB-
but
for
my
old
*NL*
comrade
's
wife
here
,
who
I
find
has
been
too
many
for
me

I
thank
*NL*
her
for
it

I
thank
you
for
it
,
Mrs.
Bagnet
,
with
all
my
heart
and
*NL*
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Mrs.
Bagnet
responds
with
two
pokes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
old
lady
impresses
upon
her
son
George
,
her
own
dear
*NL*
recovered
boy
,
her
joy
and
pride
,
the
light
of
her
eyes
,
the
happy
*NL*
close
of
her
life
,
and
every
fond
name
she
can
think
of
,
that
he
must
*NL*
be
governed
by
the
best
advice
obtainable
by
money
and
influence
,
*NL*
that
he
must
yield
up
his

to
the
greatest

that
can
be
*NL*
got
,
that
he
must
act
in
this
serious
plight
as
he
shall
be
advised
*NL*
to
act
and
must
not
be
self-willed
,
however
right
,
but
must
promise
*NL*
to
think
only
of
his
poor
old
mother
's
anxiety
and
suffering
until
he
*NL*
is
released
,
or
he
will
break
her
heart
.

*NL*
``
Mother

't
is
little
enough
to
consent
to

returns
the
trooper
,
*NL*
stopping
her
with
a
kiss
;
``
tell
me
what

*NL*
*NL*
A

from

But
my
son
is
in
danger

you
must
have
a

heart
to
pity
me

If

*NL*
any
reason
for
keeping
it
in
your

breast
,
oh
,
my
dear
Lady
,
think
*NL*
of
me
,
and
conquer
that
reason
,
and
let
it
be
known
!
This
is
the
most
*NL*
I
consider
possible
.
I
know
you
are
not
a
hard
lady
,
but
you
go
your
*NL*
own
way
always
without
help
,
and
you
are
not
familiar
with
your

and
all
who
admire
you
--
and
all
do
--
as
a
beautiful

elegant
lady
,
know
you
to
be
one
far
away
from
themselves
who

n't
*NL*
be
approached
close
.
My
Lady
,
you
may
have
some
proud
or
angry
*NL*
reasons
for
disdaining
to
utter
something
that
you
know
;
if
so
,
pray
,
*NL*
oh
,
pray
,
think
of
a
faithful
servant
whose
whole
life
has
been
*NL*
passed
in
this
family
which
she
dearly
loves
,
and
relent
,
and
help
to
*NL*
clear
my
son
!
My
Lady
,
my
good
Lady
,
''
the
old
housekeeper
pleads
with
*NL*
genuine
simplicity
,
``
I
am
so
humble
in
my
place

you
are
by
nature
*NL*
so
high
and
distant
that
you
may
not
think
what
I
feel
for
my
child
,
*NL*
but
I
feel
so
much
that
I
have
come
here
to
make
so
bold
as
to
beg
*NL*
and
pray
you
not
to
be
scornful
of
us
if
you
can
do
us
any
right
or
*NL*
justice
at
this
fearful
time
!

*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
raises
her
without
one
word
,
until
she
takes
the
letter
*NL*
from
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
read
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
gone
,
my

*NL*
``
My

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
housekeeper
leaves
her
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
.
In
truth
*NL*
she
is
not
a
hard
lady
naturally
,
and
the
time
has
been
when
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
venerable
figure
suing
to
her
with
such
strong
*NL*
earnestness
would
have
moved
her
to
great
compassion
.
But
so
long
*NL*
accustomed
to
suppress
emotion
and
keep
down
reality
,
so
long
*NL*
schooled
for
her
own
purposes
in
that
destructive
school
which
shuts
*NL*
up
the
natural
feelings
of
the
heart
like
flies
in
amber
and
spreads
*NL*
one
uniform
and
dreary
gloss
over
the
good
and
bad
,
the
feeling
and
*NL*
the
unfeeling
,
the
sensible
and
the
senseless
,
she
had
subdued
even
*NL*
her
wonder
until
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opens
the
letter
.
Spread
out
upon
the
paper
is
a
printed
account
*NL*
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
as
it
lay
face
downward
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
shot
through
the
heart
;
and
underneath
is
written
her
own
name
,
with
*NL*
the
word
``
murderess
''
attached
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
falls
out
of
her
hand
.
How
long
it
may
have
lain
upon
the
ground
*NL*
she
knows
not
,
but
it
lies
where
it
fell
when
a
servant
stands
before
*NL*
her
announcing
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
.
The
words
have
*NL*
probably
been
repeated
several
times
,
for
they
are
ringing
in
her
*NL*
head
before
she
begins
to
understand
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
come
in

*NL*
*NL*
He
comes
in

Holding
the
letter
in
her
hand
,
which
she
has
taken
from
*NL*
the
floor
,
she
tries
to
collect
her
thoughts
.
In
the
eyes
of
Mr.
*NL*
Guppy
she
is
the
same
Lady
Dedlock
,
holding
the
same
prepared
,
proud
,
*NL*
chilling
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

he
is

Mr.

sits
on

puts

his

that

reminds

Mr.

admits

*NL*
*NL*
He
can
not
do
so

she
tells
him

too
plainly
or
too
briefly
.
``
Nor

Mr.

returns
with
a
sense

injury
upon
him

``

I
,

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

considers
this
a
favourable
moment
for
sticking
up
his

with
both

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

will
remember

I
run
against

party
very
eminent
in
our
profession

*NL*
whose
loss
we
all
deplore

That
party
certainly
did
from
that
time
*NL*
apply
himself
to
cutting
in
against
me
in
a
way
that
I
will
call
*NL*
sharp
practice

did
make
it
,
at
every
turn

point
,
extremely
*NL*
difficult
for
me
to
be
sure
that
I
had
n't
inadvertently
led
up
to
*NL*
something
contrary
to
Miss
Summerson
's
wishes
.
Self-praise
is
no
*NL*
recommendation
,
but
I
may
say
for
myself
that
I
am
not
so
bad
a
man
*NL*
of
business
neither

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dedlock
looks
at
him
in
stern
inquiry
.
Mr.
Guppy
immediately
*NL*
withdraws
his
eyes
from
her
face
and
looks
anywhere
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
it
has
been
made
so
hard
,
''
he
goes
on
,
``
to
have
any
idea
*NL*
what
that
party
was
up
to
in
combination
with
others
that
until
the
*NL*
loss
which
we
all
deplore
I
was
gravelled
--
an
expression
which
your
*NL*
ladyship
,
moving
in
the
higher
circles
,
will
be
so
good
as
to
*NL*
consider
tantamount
to
knocked
over

Small
likewise
--
a
name
by
which
*NL*
I
refer
to
another
party
,
a
friend
of
mine
that
your

is
not
*NL*
acquainted
with
--
got
to
be
so
close
and
double-faced
that
at

it
*NL*
was
n't
easy
to
keep
one

hands
off
his
`

However
,
what
with
the
*NL*
exertion
of
my
humble
abilities

and
what
with
the
help
of
a
mutual
*NL*
friend
by
the
name

Mr.

Weevle
-LRB-
who
is
of
a
high
aristocratic
*NL*
turn
and
has
your

's
portrait
always
hanging
up
in
his
room
-RRB-
,
*NL*
I
have
now
reasons
for
an
apprehension
as
to
which
I
come
to
put
your
*NL*
ladyship
upon
your
guard

First
,
will
your
ladyship
allow
me
to
ask
*NL*
you
whether
you
have
had
any
strange
visitors
this
morning
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
mean
fashionable
visitors
,
but
such
visitors
,
for
instance
,
as
Miss
*NL*
Barbary
's
old
servant
,
or
as
a
person
without
the
use
of
his
lower
*NL*
extremities
,
carried
upstairs
similarly
to
a
guy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
assure
your
ladyship
that
such
visitors
have
been
here
and
*NL*
have
been
received
here
.
Because
I
saw
them
at
the
door
,
and
waited
*NL*
at
the
corner
of
the
square
till
they
came
out
,
and
took
half
an
*NL*
hour
's
turn
afterwards
to
avoid
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
to
do
with
that

Very
well

Then
I
have
only
done
my
best
to
keep
my
*NL*
promise
to
Miss
Summerson

I
strongly
suspect

from
what
Small

dropped

from
what
we
have
corkscrewed
out
of
him

letters
I
was
to
have
brought
to

not
destroyed

was

upon

it

blown
upon

been

here
this

Mr.

picks
up
his
hat
and
rises

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

you

's
anything

I

Something

nothing

I
have
acted
up

letting

She
scarcely
acknowledges
these
parting
words
by
any
look
,
but
when
*NL*
he
has
been
gone
a
little
while
,
she
rings
her
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Sir
Leicester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercury
reports
that
he
is
at
present
shut
up
in

library
alone

*NL*
``
Has

Leicester
had
any
visitors
this
morning

''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
,
on
business
.
Mercury
proceeds
to
a
description
of
them
,
*NL*
which
has
been
anticipated
by
Mr.
Guppy
.
Enough
;
he
may
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
!
All
is
broken
down
.
Her
name
is
in
these
many
mouths
,
her
husband
*NL*
knows
his
wrongs
,
her
shame
will
be
published
--
may
be
spreading
while
*NL*
she
thinks
about
it
--
and
in
addition
to
the
thunderbolt
so
long
*NL*
foreseen
by
her
,
so
unforeseen
by
him
,
she
is
denounced
by
an
*NL*
invisible
accuser
as
the
murderess
of
her
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
enemy
he
was
,
and
she
has
often
,
often
,
often
wished
him
dead
.
*NL*
Her
enemy
he
is
,
even
in
his
grave
.
This
dreadful
accusation
comes
*NL*
upon
her
like
a
new
torment
at
his
lifeless
hand
.
And
when
she
*NL*
recalls
how
she
was
secretly
at
his
door
that
night
,
and
how
she
may
*NL*
be
represented
to
have
sent
her
favourite
girl
away
so
soon
before
*NL*
merely
to
release
herself
from
observation
,
she
shudders
as
if
the
*NL*
hangman
's
hands
were
at
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
has
thrown
herself
upon
the
floor
and
lies
with
her
hair
all
*NL*
wildly
scattered
and
her
face
buried
in
the
cushions
of
a
couch
.
She
*NL*
rises
up
,
hurries
to
and
fro
,
flings
herself
down
again
,
and
rocks
*NL*
and
moans
.
The
horror
that
is
upon
her
is
unutterable
.
If
she
really
*NL*
were
the
murderess
,
it
could
hardly
be
,
for
the
moment
,
more
intense
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
as
her
murderous
perspective
,
before
the
doing
of
the
deed
,
*NL*
however
subtle
the
precautions
for
its
commission
,
would
have
been
*NL*
closed
up
by
a
gigantic
dilatation
of
the
hateful
figure
,
preventing
*NL*
her
from
seeing
any
consequences
beyond
it
;
and
as
those
consequences
*NL*
would
have
rushed
in
,
in
an
unimagined
flood
,
the
moment
the
figure
*NL*
was
laid
low
--
which
always
happens
when
a
murder
is
done
;
so
,
now
she
*NL*
sees
that
when
he
used
to
be
on
the
watch
before
her
,
and
she
used
to
*NL*
think
,
``
if
some
mortal
stroke
would
but
fall
on
this
old
man
and
take
*NL*
him
from
my
way
!
''
it
was
but
wishing
that
all
he
held
against
her
in
*NL*
his
hand
might
be
flung
to
the
winds
and
chance-sown
in
many
places
.
*NL*
So
,
too
,
with
the
wicked
relief
she
has
felt
in
his
death
.
What
was
*NL*
his
death
but
the
key-stone
of
a
gloomy
arch
removed
,
and
now
the
*NL*
arch
begins
to
fall
in
a
thousand
fragments
,
each
crushing
and
*NL*
mangling
piecemeal
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
a
terrible
impression
steals
upon
and
overshadows
her
that
from
*NL*
this
pursuer
,
living
or
dead
--
obdurate
and
imperturbable
before
her
*NL*
in
his
well-remembered
shape
,
or
not
more
obdurate
and
imperturbable
*NL*
in
his
coffin-bed
--
there
is
no
escape
but
in
death
.
Hunted
,
she
*NL*
flies
.
The
complication
of
her
shame
,
her
dread
,
remorse
,
and
misery
,
*NL*
overwhelms
her
at
its
height
;
and
even
her
strength
of
self-reliance
*NL*
is
overturned
and
whirled
away
like
a
leaf
before
a
mighty
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurriedly
addresses
these
lines
to
her
husband
,
seals
,
and
leaves
*NL*
them
on
her
table
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
am
sought
for
,
or
accused
of
,
his
murder
,
believe
*NL*
that
I
am
wholly
innocent
.
Believe
no
other
good
of
me
,
*NL*
for
I
am
innocent
of
nothing
else
that
you
have
heard
,
*NL*
or
will
hear
,
laid
to
my
charge
.
He
prepared
me
,
on
that
*NL*
fatal
night
,
for
his
disclosure
of
my
guilt
to
you
.
After
*NL*
he
had
left
me
,
I
went
out
on
pretence
of
walking
in
the
*NL*
garden
where
I
sometimes
walk
,
but
really
to
follow
him
*NL*
and
make
one
last
petition
that
he
would
not
protract
the
*NL*
dreadful
suspense
on
which
I
have
been
racked
by
him
,
you
*NL*
do
not
know
how
long
,
but
would
mercifully
strike
next
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
his
house
dark
and
silent
.
I
rang
twice
at
his
*NL*
door
,
but
there
was
no
reply
,
and
I
came
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
home
left
.
I
will
encumber
you
no
more
.
May
*NL*
you
,
in
your
just
resentment
,
be
able
to
forget
the
*NL*
unworthy
woman
on
whom
you
have
wasted
a
most
generous
*NL*
devotion
--
who
avoids
you
only
with
a
deeper
shame
than
*NL*
that
with
which
she
hurries
from
herself
--
and
who
writes
*NL*
this
last
adieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
veils
and
dresses
quickly
,
leaves
all
her
jewels
and
her
money
,
*NL*
listens
,
goes
downstairs
at
a
moment
when
the
hall
is
empty
,
opens
*NL*
and
shuts
the
great
door
,
flutters
away
in
the
shrill
frosty
wind
.

CHAPTER
LVI
*NL*
*NL*
Pursuit
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Impassive
,
as
behoves
its
high
breeding
,
the
Dedlock
town
house
*NL*
stares
at
the
other
houses
in
the
street
of
dismal
grandeur
and
gives
*NL*
no
outward
sign
of
anything
going
wrong
within
.
Carriages
rattle
,
*NL*
doors
are
battered
at
,
the
world
exchanges
calls
;
ancient
charmers
*NL*
with
skeleton
throats
and
peachy
cheeks
that
have
a
rather
ghastly
*NL*
bloom
upon
them
seen
by
daylight
,
when
indeed
these
fascinating
*NL*
creatures
look
like
Death
and
the
Lady
fused
together
,
dazzle
the
*NL*
eyes
of
men
.
Forth
from
the
frigid
mews
come
easily
swinging
*NL*
carriages
guided
by
short-legged
coachmen
in
flaxen
wigs
,
deep
sunk
*NL*
into
downy
hammercloths
,
and
up
behind
mount
luscious
Mercuries
*NL*
bearing
sticks
of
state
and
wearing
cocked
hats
broadwise
,
a
*NL*
spectacle
for
the
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dedlock
town
house
changes
not
externally
,
and
hours
pass
before
*NL*
its
exalted
dullness
is
disturbed
within
.
But
Volumnia
the
fair
,
*NL*
being
subject
to
the
prevalent
complaint
of
boredom
and
finding
that
*NL*
disorder
attacking
her
spirits
with
some
virulence
,
ventures
at
*NL*
length
to
repair
to
the
library
for
change
of
scene
.
Her
gentle
*NL*
tapping
at
the
door
producing
no
response
,
she
opens
it
and
peeps
in
;
*NL*
seeing
no
one
there
,
takes
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sprightly
Dedlock
is
reputed
,
in
that
grass-grown
city
of
the
*NL*
ancients
,
Bath
,
to
be
stimulated
by
an
urgent
curiosity
which
impels
*NL*
her
on
all
convenient
and
inconvenient
occasions
to
sidle
about
with
*NL*
a
golden
glass
at
her
eye
,
peering
into
objects
of
every
description
.
*NL*
Certain
it
is
that
she
avails
herself
of
the
present
opportunity
of
*NL*
hovering
over
her
kinsman
's
letters
and
papers
like
a
bird
,
taking
a
*NL*
short
peck
at
this
document
and
a
blink
with
her
head
on
one
side
at
*NL*
that
document
,
and
hopping
about
from
table
to
table
with
her
glass
*NL*
at
her
eye
in
an
inquisitive
and
restless
manner
.
In
the
course
of
*NL*
these
researches
she
stumbles
over
something
,
and
turning
her
glass
*NL*
in
that
direction
,
sees
her
kinsman
lying
on
the
ground
like
a
felled
*NL*
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
's
pet
little
scream
acquires
a
considerable
augmentation
of
*NL*
reality
from
this
surprise
,
and
the
house
is
quickly
in
commotion
.
*NL*
Servants
tear
up
and
down
stairs
,
bells
are
violently
rung
,
doctors
*NL*
are
sent
for
,
and
Lady
Dedlock
is
sought
in
all
directions
,
but
not
*NL*
found
.
Nobody
has
seen
or
heard
her
since
she
last
rang
her
bell
.
Her
*NL*
letter
to
Sir
Leicester
is
discovered
on
her
table
,
but
it
is
*NL*
doubtful
yet
whether
he
has
not
received
another
missive
from
another
*NL*
world
requiring
to
be
personally
answered
,
and
all
the
living
*NL*
languages
,
and
all
the
dead
,
are
as
one
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lay
him
down
upon
his
bed
,
and
chafe
,
and
rub
,
and
fan
,
and
put
*NL*
ice
to
his
head
,
and
try
every
means
of
restoration
.
Howbeit
,
the
day
*NL*
has
ebbed
away
,
and
it
is
night
in
his
room
before
his
stertorous
*NL*
breathing
lulls
or
his
fixed
eyes
show
any
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
candle
that
is
occasionally
passed
before
them
.
But
when
this
change
*NL*
begins
,
it
goes
on
;
and
by
and
by
he
nods
or
moves
his
eyes
or
even
*NL*
his
hand
in
token
that
he
hears
and
comprehends
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
down
,
this
morning
,
a
handsome
stately
gentleman
,
somewhat
*NL*
infirm
,
but
of
a
fine
presence
,
and
with
a
well-filled
face
.
He
lies
*NL*
upon
his
bed
,
an
aged
man
with
sunken
cheeks
,
the
decrepit
shadow
of
*NL*
himself
.
His
voice
was
rich
and
mellow
and
he
had
so
long
been
*NL*
thoroughly
persuaded
of
the
weight
and
import
to
mankind
of
any
word
*NL*
he
said
that
his
words
really
had
come
to
sound
as
if
there
were
*NL*
something
in
them
.
But
now
he
can
only
whisper
,
and
what
he
whispers
*NL*
sounds
like
what
it
is
--
mere
jumble
and
jargon
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
favourite
and
faithful
housekeeper
stands
at
his
bedside
.
It
is
*NL*
the
first
act
he
notices
,
and
he
clearly
derives
pleasure
from
it
.
*NL*
After
vainly
trying
to
make
himself
understood
in
speech
,
he
makes
*NL*
signs
for
a
pencil
.
So
inexpressively
that
they
can
not
at
first
*NL*
understand
him
;
it
is
his
old
housekeeper
who
makes
out
what
he
wants
*NL*
and
brings
in
a
slate
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
pausing
for
some
time
,
he
slowly
scrawls
upon
it
in
a
hand
that
*NL*
is
not
his
,
``
Chesney
Wold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
she
tells
him
;
he
is
in
London
.
He
was
taken
ill
in
the
library
*NL*
this
morning
.
Right
thankful
she
is
that
she
happened
to
come
to
*NL*
London
and
is
able
to
attend
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
an
illness
of
any
serious
consequence
,
Sir
Leicester
.
You
*NL*
will
be
much
better
to-morrow
,
Sir
Leicester
.
All
the
gentlemen
say
*NL*
so
.
''
This
,
with
the
tears
coursing
down
her
fair
old
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
making
a
survey
of
the
room
and
looking
with
particular
*NL*
attention
all
round
the
bed
where
the
doctors
stand
,
he
writes
,
``
My
*NL*
Lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lady
went
out
,
Sir
Leicester
,
before
you
were
taken
ill
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
know
of
your
illness
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
points
again
,
in
great
agitation
,
at
the
two
words
.
They
all
try
*NL*
to
quiet
him
,
but
he
points
again
with
increased
agitation
.
On
their
*NL*
looking
at
one
another
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
,
he
takes
the
slate
*NL*
once
more
and
writes
``
My
Lady
.
For
God
's
sake
,
where
?
''
And
makes
an
*NL*
imploring
moan
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
thought
better
that
his
old
housekeeper
should
give
him
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
's
letter
,
the
contents
of
which
no
one
knows
or
can
surmise
.
*NL*
She
opens
it
for
him
and
puts
it
out
for
his
perusal
.
Having
read
it
*NL*
twice
by
a
great
effort
,
he
turns
it
down
so
that
it
shall
not
be
*NL*
seen
and
lies
moaning
.
He
passes
into
a
kind
of
relapse
or
into
a
*NL*
swoon
,
and
it
is
an
hour
before
he
opens
his
eyes
,
reclining
on
his
*NL*
faithful
and
attached
old
servant
's
arm
.
The
doctors
know
that
he
is
*NL*
best
with
her
,
and
when
not
actively
engaged
about
him
,
stand
aloof
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slate
comes
into
requisition
again
,
but
the
word
he
wants
to
*NL*
write
he
can
not
remember
.
His
anxiety
,
his
eagerness
,
and
affliction
*NL*
at
this
pass
are
pitiable
to
behold
.
It
seems
as
if
he
must
go
mad
in
*NL*
the
necessity
he
feels
for
haste
and
the
inability
under
which
he
*NL*
labours
of
expressing
to
do
what
or
to
fetch
whom
.
He
has
written
the
*NL*
letter
B
,
and
there
stopped
.
Of
a
sudden
,
in
the
height
of
his
*NL*
misery
,
he
puts
Mr.
before
it
.
The
old
housekeeper
suggests
Bucket
.
*NL*
Thank
heaven
!
That
's
his
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
is
found
to
be
downstairs
,
by
appointment
.
Shall
he
come
*NL*
up
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
possibility
of
misconstruing
Sir
Leicester
's
burning
wish
*NL*
to
see
him
or
the
desire
he
signifies
to
have
the
room
cleared
of
*NL*
every
one
but
the
housekeeper
.
It
is
speedily
done
,
and
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
appears
.
Of
all
men
upon
earth
,
Sir
Leicester
seems
fallen
from
his
*NL*
high
estate
to
place
his
sole
trust
and
reliance
upon
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
I
'm
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
.
I
*NL*
hope
you
'll
cheer
up
.
I
'm
sure
you
will
,
on
account
of
the
family
*NL*
credit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
puts
her
letter
in
his
hands
and
looks
intently
in
his
*NL*
face
while
he
reads
it
.
A
new
intelligence
comes
into
Mr.
Bucket
's
*NL*
eye
as
he
reads
on
;
with
one
hook
of
his
finger
,
while
that
eye
is
*NL*
still
glancing
over
the
words
,
he
indicates
,
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
*NL*
Baronet
,
I
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
writes
upon
the
slate
.
``
Full
forgiveness

Find

''
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
stops
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
I
'll
find
her

But
my
search
after
*NL*
her
must
be
begun
out
of
hand
.
Not
a
minute
must
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
quickness
of
thought
,
he
follows
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
's
*NL*
look
towards
a
little
box
upon
a
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
here
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
?
Certainly

Open

account

Do

No

wo
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
velocity
and
certainty
of
Mr.
Bucket
's
interpretation
on
all
*NL*
these
heads
is
little
short
of
miraculous
.
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
who
holds
*NL*
the
light
,
is
giddy
with
the
swiftness
of
his
eyes
and
hands
as
he
*NL*
starts
up
,
furnished
for
his
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
George

mother

old
lady
;
that
's
about
what
you

says
Mr.
Bucket
aside
,
with
his
hat
already
on
and
*NL*
buttoning
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
am

So
I

Well

*NL*
then

tell
you
something

You
need

be
distressed
no
more

*NL*
Your

Now

do

you
begin
a-crying

do
that
by
crying

As

your

he

I
*NL*
tell
you

he
sends
his
loving
duty

hoping
you

He

that

about

till
I
have
found
*NL*
what
I
go
in
search
of
.
Say
everything
as
is
kind
and
forgiving
on
*NL*
your
part
?
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
I
will
.
And
I
wish
you
*NL*
better
,
and
these
family
affairs
smoothed
over
--
as
,
Lord
,
many
other
*NL*
family
affairs
equally
has
been
,
and
equally
will
be
,
to
the
end
of
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
peroration
,
Mr.
Bucket
,
buttoned
up
,
goes
quietly
out
,
*NL*
looking
steadily
before
him
as
if
he
were
already
piercing
the
night
*NL*
in
quest
of
the
fugitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
step
is
to
take
himself
to
Lady
Dedlock
's
rooms
and
look
*NL*
all
over
them
for
any
trifling
indication
that
may
help
him
.
The
*NL*
rooms
are
in
darkness
now
;
and
to
see
Mr.
Bucket
with
a
wax-light
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
holding
it
above
his
head
and
taking
a
sharp
mental
*NL*
inventory
of
the
many
delicate
objects
so
curiously
at
variance
with
*NL*
himself
,
would
be
to
see
a
sight
--
which
nobody
DOES
see
,
as
he
is
*NL*
particular
to
lock
himself
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
spicy
boudoir
,
this
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
who
feels
in
a
manner
*NL*
furbished
up
in
his
French
by
the
blow
of
the
morning
.
``
Must
have
*NL*
cost
a
sight
of
money
.
Rum
articles
to
cut
away
from
,
these
;
she
must
*NL*
have
been
hard
put
to
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Opening
and
shutting
table-drawers
and
looking
into
caskets
and
*NL*
jewel-cases
,
he
sees
the
reflection
of
himself
in
various
mirrors
,
*NL*
and
moralizes
thereon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
might
suppose
I
was
a-moving
in
the
fashionable
circles
and
*NL*
getting
myself
up
for
almac
's
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
I
begin
to
think
I
*NL*
must
be
a
swell
in
the
Guards
without
knowing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
looking
about
,
he
has
opened
a
dainty
little
chest
in
an
inner
*NL*
drawer
.
His
great
hand
,
turning
over
some
gloves
which
it
can
*NL*
scarcely
feel
,
they
are
so
light
and
soft
within
it
,
comes
upon
a
*NL*
white
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
Let
's
have
a
look
at
YOU
,
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
putting
down
the
*NL*
light
.
``
What
should
YOU
be
kept
by
yourself
for
?
What
's
YOUR
motive
?
*NL*
Are
you
her
ladyship
's
property
,
or
somebody
else
's
?
You
've
got
a
*NL*
mark
upon
you
somewheres
or
another
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
finds
it
as
he
speaks
,
``
Esther
Summerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
says
Mr.
Bucket
,
pausing
,
with
his
finger
at
his
ear
.
``
Come
,
*NL*
I
'll
take
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
completes
his
observations
as
quietly
and
carefully
as
he
has
*NL*
carried
them
on
,
leaves
everything
else
precisely
as
he
found
it
,
*NL*
glides
away
after
some
five
minutes
in
all
,
and
passes
into
the
*NL*
street
.
With
a
glance
upward
at
the
dimly
lighted
windows
of
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
's
room
,
he
sets
off
,
full-swing
,
to
the
nearest
*NL*
coach-stand
,
picks
out
the
horse
for
his
money
,
and
directs
to
be
*NL*
driven
to
the
shooting
gallery
.
Mr.
Bucket
does
not
claim
to
be
a
*NL*
scientific
judge
of
horses
,
but
he
lays
out
a
little
money
on
the
*NL*
principal
events
in
that
line
,
and
generally
sums
up
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
subject
in
the
remark
that
when
he
sees
a
horse
as
can
go
,
he
*NL*
knows
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
knowledge
is
not
at
fault
in
the
present
instance
.
Clattering
*NL*
over
the
stones
at
a
dangerous
pace
,
yet
thoughtfully
bringing
his
*NL*
keen
eyes
to
bear
on
every
slinking
creature
whom
he
passes
in
the
*NL*
midnight
streets
,
and
even
on
the
lights
in
upper
windows
where
*NL*
people
are
going
or
gone
to
bed
,
and
on
all
the
turnings
that
he
*NL*
rattles
by
,
and
alike
on
the
heavy
sky
,
and
on
the
earth
where
the
*NL*
snow
lies
thin
--
for
something
may
present
itself
to
assist
him
,
*NL*
anywhere
--
he
dashes
to
his
destination
at
such
a
speed
that
when
he
*NL*
stops
the
horse
half
smothers
him
in
a
cloud
of
steam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unbear
him
half
a
moment
to
freshen
him
up
,
and
I
'll
be
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
runs
up
the
long
wooden
entry
and
finds
the
trooper
smoking
his
*NL*
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
should

what

*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
has
just
come
from
there
and
gives
him
the
address
,
near

Oxford

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

n't

*NL*
*NL*
He
is
off
again
,
with
an
impression
of
having
seen
Phil
sitting
by
*NL*
the
frosty
fire
staring
at
him
open-mouthed
,
and
gallops
away
again
,
*NL*
and
gets
out
in
a
cloud
of
steam
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
the
only
person
up
in
the
house
,
is
just
going
to
bed
,
*NL*
rises
from
his
book
on
hearing
the
rapid
ringing
at
the
bell
,
and
*NL*
comes
down
to
the
door
in
his
dressing-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed

''
In
a
moment
his
visitor
is
confidential
with
*NL*
him
in
the
hall
,
has
shut
the
door
,
and
stands
with
his
hand
upon
the
*NL*
lock
.
``

Here

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
having
read

asks
him
what
he
thinks

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
Mr.

in
a
troubled
voice
repeats
,
``
Miss

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
Jarndyce

--
Mr.
Bucket
has
read
his
face
with
the
greatest
*NL*
attention
all
along
--
``
I
speak
to
you
as
a
gentleman
of
a
humane
*NL*
heart
,
and
under
such
pressing
circumstances
as
do
n't
often
happen
.
*NL*
If
ever
delay
was
dangerous
,
it
's
dangerous
now
;
and
if
ever
you
*NL*
could
n't
afterwards
forgive
yourself
for
causing
it
,
this
is
the
*NL*
time
.
Eight
or
ten
hours
,
worth
,
as
I
tell
you
,
a
hundred
pound
*NL*
apiece
at
least
,
have
been
lost
since
Lady
Dedlock
disappeared
.
I
am
*NL*
charged
to
find
her
.
I
am
Inspector
Bucket
.
Besides
all
the
rest
*NL*
that
's
heavy
on
her
,
she
has
upon
her
,
as
she
believes
,
suspicion
of
*NL*
murder
.
If
I
follow
her
alone
,
she
,
being
in
ignorance
of
what
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
has
communicated
to
me
,
may
be
driven
to
*NL*
desperation
.
But
if
I
follow
her
in
company
with
a
young
lady
,
*NL*
answering
to
the
description
of
a
young
lady
that
she
has
a
*NL*
tenderness
for
--
I
ask
no
question
,
and
I
say
no
more
than
that
--
she
*NL*
will
give
me
credit
for
being
friendly
.
Let
me
come
up
with
her
and
*NL*
be
able
to
have
the
hold
upon
her
of
putting
that
young
lady
for
`
ard
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
save
her
and
prevail
with
her
if
she
is
alive
.
Let
me
come
*NL*
up
with
her
alone
--
a
hard
matter
--
and
I
'll
do
my
best
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
answer
for
what
the
best
may
be
.
Time
flies
;
it
's
getting
on
for
one
*NL*
o'clock
.
When
one
strikes
,
there
's
another
hour
gone
,
and
it
's
worth
*NL*
a
thousand
pound
now
instead
of
a
hundred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
all
true
,
and
the
pressing
nature
of
the
case
can
not
be
*NL*
questioned
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
begs
him
to
remain
there
while
he
speaks
to
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
.
Mr.
Bucket
says
he
will
,
but
acting
on
his
usual
*NL*
principle
,
does
no
such
thing
,
following
upstairs
instead
and
keeping
*NL*
his
man
in
sight
.
So
he
remains
,
dodging
and
lurking
about
in
the
*NL*
gloom
of
the
staircase
while
they
confer
.
In
a
very
little
time
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
comes
down
and
tells
him
that
Miss
Summerson
will
join
him
*NL*
directly
and
place
herself
under
his
protection
to
accompany
him
*NL*
where
he
pleases
.
Mr.
Bucket
,
satisfied
,
expresses
high
approval
and
*NL*
awaits
her
coming
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
mounts
a
high
tower
in
his
mind
and
looks
out
far
and
wide
.
*NL*
Many
solitary
figures
he
perceives
creeping
through
the
streets
;
many
*NL*
solitary
figures
out
on
heaths
,
and
roads
,
and
lying
under
haystacks
.
*NL*
But
the
figure
that
he
seeks
is
not
among
them
.
Other
solitaries
he
*NL*
perceives
,
in
nooks
of
bridges
,
looking
over
;
and
in
shadowed
places
*NL*
down
by
the
river
's
level
;
and
a
dark
,
dark
,
shapeless
object
*NL*
drifting
with
the
tide
,
more
solitary
than
all
,
clings
with
a
*NL*
drowning
hold
on
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
is
she
?
Living
or
dead
,
where
is
she
?
If
,
as
he
folds
the
*NL*
handkerchief
and
carefully
puts
it
up
,
it
were
able
with
an
enchanted
*NL*
power
to
bring
before
him
the
place
where
she
found
it
and
the
*NL*
night-landscape
near
the
cottage
where
it
covered
the
little
child
,
*NL*
would
he
descry
her
there
?
On
the
waste
where
the
brick-kilns
are
*NL*
burning
with
a
pale
blue
flare
,
where
the
straw-roofs
of
the
wretched
*NL*
huts
in
which
the
bricks
are
made
are
being
scattered
by
the
wind
,
*NL*
where
the
clay
and
water
are
hard
frozen
and
the
mill
in
which
the
*NL*
gaunt
blind
horse
goes
round
all
day
looks
like
an
instrument
of
*NL*
human
torture
--
traversing
this
deserted
,
blighted
spot
there
is
a
*NL*
lonely
figure
with
the
sad
world
to
itself
,
pelted
by
the
snow
and
*NL*
driven
by
the
wind
,
and
cast
out
,
it
would
seem
,
from
all
*NL*
companionship
.
It
is
the
figure
of
a
woman
,
too
;
but
it
is
miserably
*NL*
dressed
,
and
no
such
clothes
ever
came
through
the
hall
and
out
at
*NL*
the
great
door
of
the
Dedlock
mansion
.

CHAPTER
LVII
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
gone
to
bed
and
fallen
asleep
when
my
guardian
knocked
at
the
*NL*
door
of
my
room
and
begged
me
to
get
up
directly
.
On
my
hurrying
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
and
learn
what
had
happened
,
he
told
me
,
after
a
word
or
*NL*
two
of
preparation
,
that
there
had
been
a
discovery
at
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
's
.
That
my
mother
had
fled
,
that
a
person
was
now
at
our
door
*NL*
who
was
empowered
to
convey
to
her
the
fullest
assurances
of
*NL*
affectionate
protection
and
forgiveness
if
he
could
possibly
find
*NL*
her
,
and
that
I
was
sought
for
to
accompany
him
in
the
hope
that
my
*NL*
entreaties
might
prevail
upon
her
if
his
failed
.
Something
to
this
*NL*
general
purpose
I
made
out
,
but
I
was
thrown
into
such
a
tumult
of
*NL*
alarm
,
and
hurry
and
distress
,
that
in
spite
of
every
effort
I
could
*NL*
make
to
subdue
my
agitation
,
I
did
not
seem
,
to
myself
,
fully
to
*NL*
recover
my
right
mind
until
hours
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
dressed
and
wrapped
up
expeditiously
without
waking
Charley
or
*NL*
any
one
and
went
down
to
Mr.
Bucket
,
who
was
the
person
entrusted
*NL*
with
the
secret
.
In
taking
me
to
him
my
guardian
told
me
this
,
and
*NL*
also
explained
how
it
was
that
he
had
come
to
think
of
me
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
in
a
low
voice
,
by
the
light
of
my
guardian
's
candle
,
read
to
*NL*
me
in
the
hall
a
letter
that
my
mother
had
left
upon
her
table
;
and
I
*NL*
suppose
within
ten
minutes
of
my
having
been
aroused
I
was
sitting
*NL*
beside
him
,
rolling
swiftly
through
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
manner
was
very
keen
,
and
yet
considerate
when
he
explained
to
me
*NL*
that
a
great
deal
might
depend
on
my
being
able
to
answer
,
without
*NL*
confusion
,
a
few
questions
that
he
wished
to
ask
me
.
These
were
,
*NL*
chiefly
,
whether
I
had
had
much
communication
with
my
mother
-LRB-
to
whom
*NL*
he
only
referred
as
Lady
Dedlock
-RRB-
,
when
and
where
I
had
spoken
with
*NL*
her
last
,
and
how
she
had
become
possessed
of
my
handkerchief
.
When
I
*NL*
had
satisfied
him
on
these
points
,
he
asked
me
particularly
to
*NL*
consider
--
taking
time
to
think
--
whether
within
my
knowledge
there
was
*NL*
any
one
,
no
matter
where
,
in
whom
she
might
be
at
all
likely
to
*NL*
confide
under
circumstances
of
the
last
necessity
.
I
could
think
of
*NL*
no
one
but
my
guardian
.
But
by
and
by
I
mentioned
Mr.
Boythorn
.
He
*NL*
came
into
my
mind
as
connected
with
his
old
chivalrous
manner
of
*NL*
mentioning
my
mother
's
name
and
with
what
my
guardian
had
informed
me
*NL*
of
his
engagement
to
her
sister
and
his
unconscious
connexion
with
*NL*
her
unhappy
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
had
stopped
the
driver
while
we
held
this
conversation
,
*NL*
that
we
might
the
better
hear
each
other
.
He
now
told
him
to
go
on
*NL*
again
and
said
to
me
,
after
considering
within
himself
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
how
to
proceed
.
He
was
quite
*NL*
willing
to
tell
me
what
his
plan
was
,
but
I
did
not
feel
clear
enough
*NL*
to
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
driven
very
far
from
our
lodgings
when
we
stopped
in
a
*NL*
by-street
at
a
public-looking
place
lighted
up
with
gas
.
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
took
me
in
and
sat
me
in
an
arm-chair
by
a
bright
fire
.
It
was
now
*NL*
past
one
,
as
I
saw
by
the
clock
against
the
wall
.
Two
police
*NL*
officers
,
looking
in
their
perfectly
neat
uniform
not
at
all
like
*NL*
people
who
were
up
all
night
,
were
quietly
writing
at
a
desk
;
and
the
*NL*
place
seemed
very
quiet
altogether
,
except
for
some
beating
and
*NL*
calling
out
at
distant
doors
underground
,
to
which
nobody
paid
any
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
man
in
uniform
,
whom
Mr.
Bucket
called
and
to
whom
he
*NL*
whispered
his
instructions
,
went
out
;
and
then
the
two
others
advised
*NL*
together
while
one
wrote
from
Mr.
Bucket
's
subdued
dictation
.
It
was
*NL*
a
description
of
my
mother
that
they
were
busy
with
,
for
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
brought
it
to
me
when
it
was
done
and
read
it
in
a
whisper
.
It
was
*NL*
very
accurate
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
officer
,
who
had
attended
to
it
closely
,
then
copied
it
*NL*
out
and
called
in
another
man
in
uniform
-LRB-
there
were
several
in
an
*NL*
outer
room
-RRB-
,
who
took
it
up
and
went
away
with
it
.
All
this
was
done
*NL*
with
the
greatest
dispatch
and
without
the
waste
of
a
moment
;
yet
*NL*
nobody
was
at
all
hurried
.
As
soon
as
the
paper
was
sent
out
upon
its
*NL*
travels
,
the
two
officers
resumed
their
former
quiet
work
of
writing
*NL*
with
neatness
and
care
.
Mr.
Bucket
thoughtfully
came
and
warmed
the
*NL*
soles
of
his
boots
,
first
one
and
then
the
other
,
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
well
wrapped
up
,
Miss
Summerson
?
''
he
asked
me
as
his
eyes
*NL*
met
mine
.
``
It
's
a
desperate
sharp
night
for
a
young
lady
to
be
out
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
cared
for
no
weather
and
was
warmly
clothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
a
long
job
,
''
he
observed
;
``
but
so
that
it
ends
well
,
never
*NL*
mind
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
to
heaven
it
may
end
well
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
comfortingly
.
``
You
see
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
you
go
and
*NL*
fret
yourself
.
You
keep
yourself
cool
and
equal
for
anything
that
may
*NL*
happen
,
and
it
'll
be
the
better
for
you
,
the
better
for
me
,
the
*NL*
better
for
Lady
Dedlock
,
and
the
better
for
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
*NL*
Baronet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
really
very
kind
and
gentle
,
and
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
*NL*
warming
his
boots
and
rubbing
his
face
with
his
forefinger
,
I
felt
a
*NL*
confidence
in
his
sagacity
which
reassured
me
.
It
was
not
yet
a
*NL*
quarter
to
two
when
I
heard
horses
'
feet
and
wheels
outside
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
are
off
,
if
you
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
his
arm
,
and
the
two
officers
courteously
bowed
me
out
,
*NL*
and
we
found
at
the
door
a
phaeton
or
barouche
with
a
postilion
and
*NL*
post
horses
.
Mr.
Bucket
handed
me
in
and
took
his
own
seat
on
the
*NL*
box
.
The
man
in
uniform
whom
he
had
sent
to
fetch
this
equipage
then
*NL*
handed
him
up
a
dark
lantern
at
his
request
,
and
when
he
had
given
a
*NL*
few
directions
to
the
driver
,
we
rattled
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
far
from
sure
that
I
was
not
in
a
dream
.
We
rattled
with
great
*NL*
rapidity
through
such
a
labyrinth
of
streets
that
I
soon
lost
all
*NL*
idea
where
we
were
,
except
that
we
had
crossed
and
re-crossed
the
*NL*
river
,
and
still
seemed
to
be
traversing
a
low-lying
,
waterside
,
*NL*
dense
neighbourhood
of
narrow
thoroughfares
chequered
by
docks
and
*NL*
basins
,
high
piles
of
warehouses
,
swing-bridges
,
and
masts
of
ships
.
*NL*
At
length
we
stopped
at
the
corner
of
a
little
slimy
turning
,
which
*NL*
the
wind
from
the
river
,
rushing
up
it
,
did
not
purify
;
and
I
saw
my
*NL*
companion
,
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
,
in
conference
with
several
*NL*
men
who
looked
like
a
mixture
of
police
and
sailors
.
Against
the
*NL*
mouldering
wall
by
which
they
stood
,
there
was
a
bill
,
on
which
I
*NL*
could
discern
the
words
,
``
Found
Drowned
''
;
and
this
and
an
inscription
*NL*
about
drags
possessed
me
with
the
awful
suspicion
shadowed
forth
in
*NL*
our
visit
to
that
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
need
to
remind
myself
that
I
was
not
there
by
the
indulgence
*NL*
of
any
feeling
of
mine
to
increase
the
difficulties
of
the
search
,
or
*NL*
to
lessen
its
hopes
,
or
enhance
its
delays
.
I
remained
quiet
,
but
*NL*
what
I
suffered
in
that
dreadful
spot
I
never
can
forget
.
And
still
*NL*
it
was
like
the
horror
of
a
dream
.
A
man
yet
dark
and
muddy
,
in
long
*NL*
swollen
sodden
boots
and
a
hat
like
them
,
was
called
out
of
a
boat
*NL*
and
whispered
with
Mr.
Bucket
,
who
went
away
with
him
down
some
*NL*
slippery
steps
--
as
if
to
look
at
something
secret
that
he
had
to
*NL*
show
.
They
came
back
,
wiping
their
hands
upon
their
coats
,
after
*NL*
turning
over
something
wet
;
but
thank
God
it
was
not
what
I
feared
!
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
further
conference
,
Mr.
Bucket
-LRB-
whom
everybody
seemed
to
*NL*
know
and
defer
to
-RRB-
went
in
with
the
others
at
a
door
and
left
me
in
*NL*
the
carriage
,
while
the
driver
walked
up
and
down
by
his
horses
to
*NL*
warm
himself
.
The
tide
was
coming
in
,
as
I
judged
from
the
sound
it
*NL*
made
,
and
I
could
hear
it
break
at
the
end
of
the
alley
with
a
little
*NL*
rush
towards
me
.
It
never
did
so
--
and
I
thought
it
did
so
,
hundreds
*NL*
of
times
,
in
what
can
have
been
at
the
most
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
*NL*
probably
was
less
--
but
the
thought
shuddered
through
me
that
it
would
*NL*
cast
my
mother
at
the
horses
'
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
came
out
again
,
exhorting
the
others
to
be
vigilant
,
*NL*
darkened
his
lantern
,
and
once
more
took
his
seat
.
``
Do
n't
you
be
*NL*
alarmed
,
Miss
Summerson
,
on
account
of
our
coming
down
here
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
turning
to
me
.
``
I
only
want
to
have
everything
in
train
and
to
*NL*
know
that
it
is
in
train
by
looking
after
it
myself
.
Get
on
,
my
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
appeared
to
retrace
the
way
we
had
come
.
Not
that
I
had
taken
note
*NL*
of
any
particular
objects
in
my
perturbed
state
of
mind
,
but
judging
*NL*
from
the
general
character
of
the
streets
.
We
called
at
another
*NL*
office
or
station
for
a
minute
and
crossed
the
river
again
.
During
*NL*
the
whole
of
this
time
,
and
during
the
whole
search
,
my
companion
,
*NL*
wrapped
up
on
the
box
,
never
relaxed
in
his
vigilance
a
single
*NL*
moment
;
but
when
we
crossed
the
bridge
he
seemed
,
if
possible
,
to
be
*NL*
more
on
the
alert
than
before
.
He
stood
up
to
look
over
the
parapet
,
*NL*
he
alighted
and
went
back
after
a
shadowy
female
figure
that
flitted
*NL*
past
us
,
and
he
gazed
into
the
profound
black
pit
of
water
with
a
*NL*
face
that
made
my
heart
die
within
me
.
The
river
had
a
fearful
look
,
*NL*
so
overcast
and
secret
,
creeping
away
so
fast
between
the
low
flat
*NL*
lines
of
shore
--
so
heavy
with
indistinct
and
awful
shapes
,
both
of
*NL*
substance
and
shadow
;
so
death-like
and
mysterious
.
I
have
seen
it
*NL*
many
times
since
then
,
by
sunlight
and
by
moonlight
,
but
never
free
*NL*
from
the
impressions
of
that
journey
.
In
my
memory
the
lights
upon
*NL*
the
bridge
are
always
burning
dim
,
the
cutting
wind
is
eddying
round
*NL*
the
homeless
woman
whom
we
pass
,
the
monotonous
wheels
are
whirling
*NL*
on
,
and
the
light
of
the
carriage-lamps
reflected
back
looks
palely
*NL*
in
upon
me
--
a
face
rising
out
of
the
dreaded
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clattering
and
clattering
through
the
empty
streets
,
we
came
at
*NL*
length
from
the
pavement
on
to
dark
smooth
roads
and
began
to
leave
*NL*
the
houses
behind
us
.
After
a
while
I
recognized
the
familiar
way
to
*NL*
Saint
Albans
.
At
Barnet
fresh
horses
were
ready
for
us
,
and
we
*NL*
changed
and
went
on
.
It
was
very
cold
indeed
,
and
the
open
country
*NL*
was
white
with
snow
,
though
none
was
falling
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
acquaintance
of
yours
,
this
road
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
returned
.
``
Have
you
gathered
any
intelligence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
that
can
be
quite
depended
on
as
yet
,
''
he
answered
,
``
but
it
's
*NL*
early
times
as
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
gone
into
every
late
or
early
public-house
where
there
*NL*
was
a
light
-LRB-
they
were
not
a
few
at
that
time
,
the
road
being
*NL*
then
much
frequented
by
drovers
-RRB-
and
had
got
down
to
talk
to
the
*NL*
turnpike-keepers
.
I
had
heard
him
ordering
drink
,
and
chinking
money
,
*NL*
and
making
himself
agreeable
and
merry
everywhere
;
but
whenever
he
*NL*
took
his
seat
upon
the
box
again
,
his
face
resumed
its
watchful
*NL*
steady
look
,
and
he
always
said
to
the
driver
in
the
same
business
*NL*
tone
,
``
Get
on
,
my
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
these
stoppages
,
it
was
between
five
and
six
o'clock
and
we
*NL*
were
yet
a
few
miles
short
of
Saint
Albans
when
he
came
out
of
one
of
*NL*
these
houses
and
handed
me
in
a
cup
of
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
it
,
Miss
Summerson
,
it
'll
do
you
good
.
You
're
beginning
to
get
*NL*
more
yourself
now
,
ai
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
and
said
I
hoped
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
was
what
you
may
call
stunned
at
first
,
''
he
returned
;
``
and
Lord
,
*NL*
no
wonder
!
Do
n't
speak
loud
,
my
dear
.
It
's
all
right
.
She
's
on
*NL*
ahead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
joyful
exclamation
I
made
or
was
going
to
make
,
but
*NL*
he
put
up
his
finger
and
I
stopped
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Passed
through
here
on
foot
this
evening
about
eight
or
nine
.
I
*NL*
heard
of
her
first
at
the
archway
toll
,
over
at
Highgate
,
but
*NL*
could
n't
make
quite
sure
.
Traced
her
all
along
,
on
and
off
.
Picked
*NL*
her
up
at
one
place
,
and
dropped
her
at
another
;
but
she
's
before
us
*NL*
now
,
safe
.
Take
hold
of
this
cup
and
saucer
,
ostler
.
Now
,
if
you
*NL*
was
n't
brought
up
to
the
butter
trade
,
look
out
and
see
if
you
can
*NL*
catch
half
a
crown
in
your
t

other
hand
.
One
,
two
,
three
,
and
there
*NL*
you
are
!
Now
,
my
lad
,
try
a
gallop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
soon
in
Saint
Albans
and
alighted
a
little
before
day
,
when
I
*NL*
was
just
beginning
to
arrange
and
comprehend
the
occurrences
of
the
*NL*
night
and
really
to
believe
that
they
were
not
a
dream
.
Leaving
the
*NL*
carriage
at
the
posting-house
and
ordering
fresh
horses
to
be
ready
,
*NL*
my
companion
gave
me
his
arm
,
and
we
went
towards
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
this
is
your
regular
abode
,
Miss
Summerson
,
you
see
,
''
he
*NL*
observed
,
``
I
should
like
to
know
whether
you
've
been
asked
for
by
any
*NL*
stranger
answering
the
description
,
or
whether
Mr.
Jarndyce
has
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
much
expect
it
,
but
it
might
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
ascended
the
hill
,
he
looked
about
him
with
a
sharp
eye
--
the
*NL*
day
was
now
breaking
--
and
reminded
me
that
I
had
come
down
it
one
*NL*
night
,
as
I
had
reason
for
remembering
,
with
my
little
servant
and
*NL*
poor
Jo
,
whom
he
called
Toughey
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
how
he
knew
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
passed
a
man
upon
the
road
,
just
yonder
,
you
know
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
remembered
that
too
,
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
my
surprise
,
he
went
on
,
``
I
drove
down
in
a
gig
that
afternoon
*NL*
to
look
after
that
boy
.
You
might
have
heard
my
wheels
when
you
came
*NL*
out
to
look
after
him
yourself
,
for
I
was
aware
of
you
and
your
*NL*
little
maid
going
up
when
I
was
walking
the
horse
down
.
Making
an
*NL*
inquiry
or
two
about
him
in
the
town
,
I
soon
heard
what
company
he
*NL*
was
in
and
was
coming
among
the
brick-fields
to
look
for
him
when
I
*NL*
observed
you
bringing
him
home
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
he
committed
any
crime
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
was
charged
against
him
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
coolly
lifting
off
*NL*
his
hat
,
``
but
I
suppose
he
was
n't
over-particular
.
No
.
What
I
wanted
*NL*
him
for
was
in
connexion
with
keeping
this
very
matter
of
Lady
*NL*
Dedlock
quiet
.
He
had
been
making
his
tongue
more
free
than
welcome
*NL*
as
to
a
small
accidental
service
he
had
been
paid
for
by
the
deceased
*NL*
Mr.
Tulkinghorn
;
and
it
would
n't
do
,
at
any
sort
of
price
,
to
have
*NL*
him
playing
those
games
.
So
having
warned
him
out
of
London
,
I
made
*NL*
an
afternoon
of
it
to
warn
him
to
keep
out
of
it
now
he
WAS
away
,
and
*NL*
go
farther
from
it
,
and
maintain
a
bright
look-out
that
I
did
n't
*NL*
catch
him
coming
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
creature
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
enough
,
''
assented
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
and
trouble
enough
,
and
well
*NL*
enough
away
from
London
,
or
anywhere
else
.
I
was
regularly
turned
on
*NL*
my
back
when
I
found
him
taken
up
by
your
establishment
,
I
do
assure
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
why
.
``
Why
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Naturally
there
*NL*
was
no
end
to
his
tongue
then
.
He
might
as
well
have
been
born
with
a
*NL*
yard
and
a
half
of
it
,
and
a
remnant
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
remember
this
conversation
now
,
my
head
was
in
confusion
*NL*
at
the
time
,
and
my
power
of
attention
hardly
did
more
than
enable
me
*NL*
to
understand
that
he
entered
into
these
particulars
to
divert
me
.
*NL*
With
the
same
kind
intention
,
manifestly
,
he
often
spoke
to
me
of
*NL*
indifferent
things
,
while
his
face
was
busy
with
the
one
object
that
*NL*
we
had
in
view
.
He
still
pursued
this
subject
as
we
turned
in
at
the
*NL*
garden-gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Here
we
are
,
and
a
nice
retired
place
it
is
.
*NL*
Puts
a
man
in
mind
of
the
country
house
in
the
Woodpecker-tapping
,
*NL*
that
was
known
by
the
smoke
which
so
gracefully
curled
.
They
're
early
*NL*
with
the
kitchen
fire
,
and
that
denotes
good
servants
.
But
what
*NL*
you
've
always
got
to
be
careful
of
with
servants
is
who
comes
to
see
*NL*
'em
;
you
never
know
what
they
're
up
to
if
you
do
n't
know
that
.
And
*NL*
another
thing
,
my
dear
.
Whenever
you
find
a
young
man
behind
the
*NL*
kitchen-door
,
you
give
that
young
man
in
charge
on
suspicion
of
being
*NL*
secreted
in
a
dwelling-house
with
an
unlawful
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
now
in
front
of
the
house
;
he
looked
attentively
and
closely
*NL*
at
the
gravel
for
footprints
before
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
*NL*
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
generally
put
that
elderly
young
gentleman
in
the
same
room
*NL*
when
he
's
on
a
visit
here
,
Miss
Summerson
?
''
he
inquired
,
glancing
at
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
's
usual
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Mr.
Skimpole
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
him
again
?
''
returned
Mr.
Bucket
,
bending
down
his
*NL*
ear
.
``
Skimpole
,
is
it
?
I
've
often
wondered
what
his
name
might
be
.
*NL*
Skimpole
.
Not
John
,
I
should
say
,
nor
yet
Jacob
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harold
,
''
I
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harold
.
Yes
.
He
's
a
queer
bird
is
Harold
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
eyeing
*NL*
me
with
great
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
singular
character
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
idea
of
money
,
''
observed
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
He
takes
it
,
though
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
involuntarily
returned
for
answer
that
I
perceived
Mr.
Bucket
knew
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
now
I
'll
tell
you
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Your
mind
will
*NL*
be
all
the
better
for
not
running
on
one
point
too
continually
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
for
a
change
.
It
was
him
as
pointed
out
to
me
where
*NL*
Toughey
was
.
I
made
up
my
mind
that
night
to
come
to
the
door
and
ask
*NL*
for
Toughey
,
if
that
was
all
;
but
willing
to
try
a
move
or
so
first
,
*NL*
if
any
such
was
on
the
board
,
I
just
pitched
up
a
morsel
of
gravel
at
*NL*
that
window
where
I
saw
a
shadow
.
As
soon
as
Harold
opens
it
and
I
*NL*
have
had
a
look
at
him
,
thinks
I
,
you
're
the
man
for
me
.
So
I
*NL*
smoothed
him
down
a
bit
about
not
wanting
to
disturb
the
family
after
*NL*
they
was
gone
to
bed
and
about
its
being
a
thing
to
be
regretted
that
*NL*
charitable
young
ladies
should
harbour
vagrants
;
and
then
,
when
I
*NL*
pretty
well
understood
his
ways
,
I
said
I
should
consider
a
fypunnote
*NL*
well
bestowed
if
I
could
relieve
the
premises
of
Toughey
without
*NL*
causing
any
noise
or
trouble
.
Then
says
he
,
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
*NL*
in
the
gayest
way
,
`
It
's
no
use
mentioning
a
fypunnote
to
me
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
because
I
'm
a
mere
child
in
such
matters
and
have
no
idea
of
*NL*
money
.
'
Of
course
I
understood
what
his
taking
it
so
easy
meant
;
and
*NL*
being
now
quite
sure
he
was
the
man
for
me
,
I
wrapped
the
note
round
*NL*
a
little
stone
and
threw
it
up
to
him
.
Well
!
He
laughs
and
beams
,
and
*NL*
looks
as
innocent
as
you
like
,
and
says
,
`
But
I
do
n't
know
the
value
*NL*
of
these
things
.
What
am
I
to
DO
with
this
?
'
`
Spend
it
,
sir
,
'
says
I.
*NL*
`
But
I
shall
be
taken
in
,
'
he
says
,
`
they
wo
n't
give
me
the
right
*NL*
change
,
I
shall
lose
it
,
it
's
no
use
to
me
.
'
Lord
,
you
never
saw
such
*NL*
a
face
as
he
carried
it
with
!
Of
course
he
told
me
where
to
find
*NL*
Toughey
,
and
I
found
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
regarded
this
as
very
treacherous
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Skimpole
*NL*
towards
my
guardian
and
as
passing
the
usual
bounds
of
his
childish
*NL*
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bounds
,
my
dear
?
''
returned
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Bounds
?
Now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
*NL*
I
'll
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
that
your
husband
will
find
useful
*NL*
when
you
are
happily
married
and
have
got
a
family
about
you
.
*NL*
Whenever
a
person
says
to
you
that
they
are
as
innocent
as
can
be
in
*NL*
all
concerning
money
,
look
well
after
your
own
money
,
for
they
are
*NL*
dead
certain
to
collar
it
if
they
can
.
Whenever
a
person
proclaims
to
*NL*
you
`
In
worldly
matters
I
'm
a
child
,
'
you
consider
that
that
person
*NL*
is
only
a-crying
off
from
being
held
accountable
and
that
you
have
*NL*
got
that
person
's
number
,
and
it
's
Number
One
.
Now
,
I
am
not
a
*NL*
poetical
man
myself
,
except
in
a
vocal
way
when
it
goes
round
a
*NL*
company
,
but
I
'm
a
practical
one
,
and
that
's
my
experience
.
So
's
this
*NL*
rule
.
Fast
and
loose
in
one
thing
,
fast
and
loose
in
everything
.
I
*NL*
never
knew
it
fail
.
No
more
will
you
.
Nor
no
one
.
With
which
caution
*NL*
to
the
unwary
,
my
dear
,
I
take
the
liberty
of
pulling
this
here
bell
,
*NL*
and
so
go
back
to
our
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
it
had
not
been
for
a
moment
out
of
his
mind
,
any
more
than
*NL*
it
had
been
out
of
my
mind
,
or
out
of
his
face
.
The
whole
household
*NL*
were
amazed
to
see
me
,
without
any
notice
,
at
that
time
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
so
accompanied
;
and
their
surprise
was
not
diminished
by
*NL*
my
inquiries
.
No
one
,
however
,
had
been
there
.
It
could
not
be
*NL*
doubted
that
this
was
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
my
companion
,
``
we
ca
n't
be
too
soon
at
*NL*
the
cottage
where
those
brickmakers
are
to
be
found
.
Most
inquiries
*NL*
there
I
leave
to
you
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
as
to
make
'em
.
The
*NL*
naturalest
way
is
the
best
way
,
and
the
naturalest
way
is
your
own
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
set
off
again
immediately
.
On
arriving
at
the
cottage
,
we
found
it
*NL*
shut
up
and
apparently
deserted
,
but
one
of
the
neighbours
who
knew
*NL*
me
and
who
came
out
when
I
was
trying
to
make
some
one
hear
informed
*NL*
me
that
the
two
women
and
their
husbands
now
lived
together
in
*NL*
another
house
,
made
of
loose
rough
bricks
,
which
stood
on
the
margin
*NL*
of
the
piece
of
ground
where
the
kilns
were
and
where
the
long
rows
*NL*
of
bricks
were
drying
.
We
lost
no
time
in
repairing
to
this
place
,
*NL*
which
was
within
a
few
hundred
yards
;
and
as
the
door
stood
ajar
,
I
*NL*
pushed
it
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
three
of
them
sitting
at
breakfast
,
the
child
lying
*NL*
asleep
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
.
It
was
Jenny
,
the
mother
of
the
dead
*NL*
child
,
who
was
absent
.
The
other
woman
rose
on
seeing
me
;
and
the
*NL*
men
,
though
they
were
,
as
usual
,
sulky
and
silent
,
each
gave
me
a
*NL*
morose
nod
of
recognition
.
A
look
passed
between
them
when
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
followed
me
in
,
and
I
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
woman
evidently
*NL*
knew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
asked
leave
to
enter
of
course
.
Liz
-LRB-
the
only
name
by
which
I
*NL*
knew
her
-RRB-
rose
to
give
me
her
own
chair
,
but
I
sat
down
on
a
stool
*NL*
near
the
fire
,
and
Mr.
Bucket
took
a
corner
of
the
bedstead
.
Now
that
*NL*
I
had
to
speak
and
was
among
people
with
whom
I
was
not
familiar
,
I
*NL*
became
conscious
of
being
hurried
and
giddy
.
It
was
very
difficult
to
*NL*
begin
,
and
I
could
not
help
bursting
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liz
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
have
come
a
long
way
in
the
night
and
through
the
*NL*
snow
to
inquire
after
a
lady

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
been
here
,
you
know
,
''
Mr.
Bucket
struck
in
,
addressing
the
*NL*
whole
group
with
a
composed
propitiatory
face
;
``
that
's
the
lady
the
*NL*
young
lady
means

The
lady
that
was
here
last
night

you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
told
YOU
as
there
was
anybody
here
?
''
inquired
Jenny
's
*NL*
husband
,
who
had
made
a
surly
stop
in
his
eating
to
listen
and
now
*NL*
measured
him
with
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
person
of
the
name
of
Michael
Jackson
,
with
a
blue
welveteen
*NL*
waistcoat
with
a
double
row
of
mother
of
pearl
buttons
,
''
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
immediately
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
as
good
mind
his
own
business
,
whoever
he
is
,
''
growled
the
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
out
of
employment
,
I
believe
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
apologetically
*NL*
for
Michael
Jackson
,
``
and
so
gets
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
had
not
resumed
her
chair
,
but
stood
faltering
with
her
*NL*
hand
upon
its
broken
back
,
looking
at
me
.
I
thought
she
would
have
*NL*
spoken
to
me
privately
if
she
had
dared
.
She
was
still
in
this
*NL*
attitude
of
uncertainty
when
her
husband
,
who
was
eating
with
a
lump
*NL*
of
bread
and
fat
in
one
hand
and
his
clasp-knife
in
the
other
,
struck
*NL*
the
handle
of
his
knife
violently
on
the
table
and
told
her
with
an
*NL*
oath
to
mind
HER
own
business
at
any
rate
and
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
have
seen
Jenny
very
much
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
I
am
sure
*NL*
she
would
have
told
me
all
she
could

this
lady

whom
I
am
very
*NL*
anxious
indeed
--
you
can
not
think
how
anxious

to
overtake
.
Will
Jenny
*NL*
be
here
soon
?
Where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
had
a
great
desire
to
answer
,
but
the
man
,
with
another
*NL*
oath
,
openly
kicked
at
her
foot
with
his
heavy
boot
.
He
left
it
to
*NL*
Jenny
's
husband
to
say
what
he
chose
,
and
after
a
dogged
silence
the
*NL*
latter
turned
his
shaggy
head
towards
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
partial

.
I
let
their
places
be
,
and
it
's
*NL*
curious
they
ca
n't
let
my
place
be
.
There
'd
be
a
pretty
shine
made
if
*NL*
I
was
to
go
a-wisitin
THEM
,
I
think
.
Howsoever
,
I
do
n't
so
much
*NL*
complain
of
you
as
of
some
others
,
and
I
'm
agreeable
to
make
you
a
*NL*
civil
answer
,
though
I
give
notice
that
I
'm
not
a-going
to
be
drawed
*NL*
like
a
badger
.
Will
Jenny
be
here
soon
?
No
she
wo
n't
.
Where
is
she
?
*NL*
She
's
gone
up
to
Lunnun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
go
last
night
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
go
last
night
?
Ah
!
She
went
last
night
,
''
he
answered
with
a
*NL*
sulky
jerk
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
was
she
here
when
the
lady
came
?
And
what
did
the
lady
say
to
*NL*
her
?
And
where
is
the
lady
gone
?
I
beg
and
pray
you
to
be
so
kind
as
*NL*
to
tell
me
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
I
am
in
great
distress
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
master
would
let
me
speak
,
and
not
say
a
word
of
harm
--
''
the
*NL*
woman
timidly
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
master
,
''
said
her
husband
,
muttering
an
imprecation
with
slow
*NL*
emphasis
,
``
will
break
your
neck
if
you
meddle
with
wot
do
n't
concern
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
another
silence
,
the
husband
of
the
absent
woman
,
turning
to
me
*NL*
again
,
answered
me
with
his
usual
grumbling
unwillingness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wos
Jenny
here
when
the
lady
come
?
Yes
,
she
wos
here
when
the
lady
*NL*
come
.
Wot
did
the
lady
say
to
her
?
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
wot
the
lady
*NL*
said
to
her
.
She
said
,
`
You
remember
me
as
come
one
time
to
talk
to
*NL*
you
about
the
young
lady
as
had
been
a-wisiting
of
you
?
You
remember
*NL*
me
as
give
you
somethink
handsome
for
a
handkercher
wot
she
had
*NL*
left
?
'
Ah
,
she
remembered
.
So
we
all
did
.
Well
,
then
,
wos
that
young
*NL*
lady
up
at
the
house
now
?
No
,
she
war
n't
up
at
the
house
now
.
Well
,
*NL*
then
,
lookee
here
.
The
lady
was
upon
a
journey
all
alone
,
strange
as
*NL*
we
might
think
it
,
and
could
she
rest
herself
where
you
're
a
setten
*NL*
for
a
hour
or
so
.
Yes
she
could
,
and
so
she
did
.
Then
she
went
--
it
*NL*
might
be
at
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
,
and
it
might
be
at
twenty
*NL*
minutes
past
twelve
;
we
ai
n't
got
no
watches
here
to
know
the
time
*NL*
by
,
nor
yet
clocks
.
Where
did
she
go
?
I
do
n't
know
where
she
go
'd
.
*NL*
She
went
one
way
,
and
Jenny
went
another
;
one
went
right
to
Lunnun
,
*NL*
and
t
`
other
went
right
from
it
.
That
's
all
about
it
.
Ask
this
man
.
He
*NL*
heerd
it
all
,
and
see
it
all
.
He
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
man
repeated
,
``
That
's
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
the
lady
crying
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
a
bit
,
''
returned
the
first
man
.
``
Her
shoes
was
the
worse
,
and
*NL*
her
clothes
was
the
worse
,
but
she
war
n't
--
not
as
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
sat
with
her
arms
crossed
and
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
Her
*NL*
husband
had
turned
his
seat
a
little
so
as
to
face
her
and
kept
his
*NL*
hammer-like
hand
upon
the
table
as
if
it
were
in
readiness
to
execute
*NL*
his
threat
if
she
disobeyed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
not
object
to
my
asking
your
wife
,
''
said
I
,
``
how
the
*NL*
lady
looked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
!
''
he
gruffly
cried
to
her
.
``
You
hear
what
she
says
.
Cut
*NL*
it
short
and
tell
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
,
''
replied
the
woman
.
``
Pale
and
exhausted
.
Very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
speak
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
but
her
voice
was
hoarse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
,
looking
all
the
while
at
her
husband
for
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
faint
?
''
said
I.
``
Did
she
eat
or
drink
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
''
said
the
husband
in
answer
to
her
look
.
``
Tell
her
and
cut
it
*NL*
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
a
little
water

miss

and
Jenny
fetched
her
some
bread
and
*NL*
tea

But
she
hardly
touched
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
she
went
from
here
,
''
I
was
proceeding
,
when
Jenny
's
husband
*NL*
impatiently
took
me
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
went
from
here
,
she
went
right
away
nor
`
ard
by
the
high
*NL*
road

Ask
on
the
road
if
you
doubt
me
,
and
see
if
it
war
n't
so
.
Now
,
*NL*
there
's
the
end
.
That
's
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
at
my
companion
,
and
finding
that
he
had
already
risen
and
*NL*
was
ready
to
depart
,
thanked
them
for
what
they
had
told
me
,
and
took
*NL*
my
leave
.
The
woman
looked
full
at
Mr.
Bucket
as
he
went
out
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
full
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
said
to
me
as
we
walked
quickly
away
.
*NL*
``
They
've
got
her
ladyship
's
watch
among
'em
.
That
's
a
positive
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
it
?
''
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
good
as
saw
it
,
''
he
returned
.
``
Else
why
should
he
talk
about
*NL*
his
`
twenty
minutes
past
'
and
about
his
having
no
watch
to
tell
the
*NL*
time
by
?
Twenty
minutes
!
He
do
n't
usually
cut
his
time
so
fine
as
*NL*
that
.
If
he
comes
to
half-hours
,
it
's
as
much
as
HE
does
.
Now
,
you
*NL*
see
,
either
her
ladyship
gave
him
that
watch
or
he
took
it
.
I
think
*NL*
she
gave
it
him
.
Now
,
what
should
she
give
it
him
for
?
What
should
*NL*
she
give
it
him
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
this
question
to
himself
several
times
as
we
hurried
on
,
*NL*
appearing
to
balance
between
a
variety
of
answers
that
arose
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
time
could
be
spared
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
which
is
the
only
thing
*NL*
that
ca
n't
be
spared
in
this
case
,
I
might
get
it
out
of
that
woman
;
*NL*
but
it
's
too
doubtful
a
chance
to
trust
to
under
present
*NL*
circumstances
.
They
are
up
to
keeping
a
close
eye
upon
her
,
and
any
*NL*
fool
knows
that
a
poor
creetur
like
her
,
beaten
and
kicked
and
*NL*
scarred
and
bruised
from
head
to
foot
,
will
stand
by
the
husband
that
*NL*
ill
uses
her
through
thick
and
thin
.
There
's
something
kept
back
.
*NL*
It
's
a
pity
but
what
we
had
seen
the
other
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
regretted
it
exceedingly
,
for
she
was
very
grateful
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
sure
would
have
resisted
no
entreaty
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
possible
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
pondering
on
it
,
*NL*
``
that
her
ladyship
sent
her
up
to
London
with
some
word
for
you
,
and
*NL*
it
's
possible
that
her
husband
got
the
watch
to
let
her
go
.
It
do
n't
*NL*
come
out
altogether
so
plain
as
to
please
me
,
but
it
's
on
the
cards
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
do
n't
take
kindly
to
laying
out
the
money
of
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
on
these
roughs
,
and
I
do
n't
see
my
way
to
the
*NL*
usefulness
of
it
at
present
.
No
!
So
far
our
road
,
Miss
Summerson
,
is
*NL*
for
`
ard
--
straight
ahead
--
and
keeping
everything
quiet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
called
at
home
once
more
that
I
might
send
a
hasty
note
to
my
*NL*
guardian
,
and
then
we
hurried
back
to
where
we
had
left
the
carriage
.
*NL*
The
horses
were
brought
out
as
soon
as
we
were
seen
coming
,
and
we
*NL*
were
on
the
road
again
in
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
set
in
snowing
at
daybreak
,
and
it
now
snowed
hard
.
The
air
*NL*
was
so
thick
with
the
darkness
of
the
day
and
the
density
of
the
fall
*NL*
that
we
could
see
but
a
very
little
way
in
any
direction
.
Although
it
*NL*
was
extremely
cold
,
the
snow
was
but
partially
frozen
,
and
it
*NL*
churned
--
with
a
sound
as
if
it
were
a
beach
of
small
shells
--
under
*NL*
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
into
mire
and
water
.
They
sometimes
slipped
*NL*
and
floundered
for
a
mile
together
,
and
we
were
obliged
to
come
to
a
*NL*
standstill
to
rest
them
.
One
horse
fell
three
times
in
this
first
*NL*
stage
,
and
trembled
so
and
was
so
shaken
that
the
driver
had
to
*NL*
dismount
from
his
saddle
and
lead
him
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
eat
nothing
and
could
not
sleep
,
and
I
grew
so
nervous
under
*NL*
those
delays
and
the
slow
pace
at
which
we
travelled
that
I
had
an
*NL*
unreasonable
desire
upon
me
to
get
out
and
walk
.
Yielding
to
my
*NL*
companion
's
better
sense
,
however
,
I
remained
where
I
was
.
All
this
*NL*
time
,
kept
fresh
by
a
certain
enjoyment
of
the
work
in
which
he
was
*NL*
engaged
,
he
was
up
and
down
at
every
house
we
came
to
,
addressing
*NL*
people
whom
he
had
never
beheld
before
as
old
acquaintances
,
running
*NL*
in
to
warm
himself
at
every
fire
he
saw
,
talking
and
drinking
and
*NL*
shaking
hands
at
every
bar
and
tap
,
friendly
with
every
waggoner
,
*NL*
wheelwright
,
blacksmith
,
and
toll-taker
,
yet
never
seeming
to
lose
*NL*
time
,
and
always
mounting
to
the
box
again
with
his
watchful
,
steady
*NL*
face
and
his
business-like
``
Get
on
,
my
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
changing
horses
the
next
time
,
he
came
from
the
*NL*
stable-yard
,
with
the
wet
snow
encrusted
upon
him
and
dropping
off
*NL*
him
--
plashing
and
crashing
through
it
to
his
wet
knees
as
he
had
been
*NL*
doing
frequently
since
we
left
Saint
Albans
--
and
spoke
to
me
at
the
*NL*
carriage
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
up
your
spirits
.
It
's
certainly
true
that
she
came
on
here
,
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
.
There
's
not
a
doubt
of
the
dress
by
this
time
,
and
*NL*
the
dress
has
been
seen
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
on
foot
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
on
foot
.
I
think
the
gentleman
you
mentioned
must
be
the
point
*NL*
she
's
aiming
at
,
and
yet
I
do
n't
like
his
living
down
in
her
own
part
*NL*
of
the
country
neither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
so
little
,
''
said
I.
``
There
may
be
some
one
else
nearer
here
,
*NL*
of
whom
I
never
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
.
But
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
you
fall
a-crying
,
my
dear
;
*NL*
and
do
n't
you
worry
yourself
no
more
than
you
can
help
.
Get
on
,
my
*NL*
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sleet
fell
all
that
day
unceasingly
,
a
thick
mist
came
on
early
,
*NL*
and
it
never
rose
or
lightened
for
a
moment
.
Such
roads
I
had
never
*NL*
seen
.
I
sometimes
feared
we
had
missed
the
way
and
got
into
the
*NL*
ploughed
grounds
or
the
marshes
.
If
I
ever
thought
of
the
time
I
had
*NL*
been
out
,
it
presented
itself
as
an
indefinite
period
of
great
*NL*
duration
,
and
I
seemed
,
in
a
strange
way
,
never
to
have
been
free
*NL*
from
the
anxiety
under
which
I
then
laboured
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
advanced
,
I
began
to
feel
misgivings
that
my
companion
lost
*NL*
confidence
.
He
was
the
same
as
before
with
all
the
roadside
people
,
*NL*
but
he
looked
graver
when
he
sat
by
himself
on
the
box
.
I
saw
his
*NL*
finger
uneasily
going
across
and
across
his
mouth
during
the
whole
of
*NL*
one
long
weary
stage
.
I
overheard
that
he
began
to
ask
the
drivers
of
*NL*
coaches
and
other
vehicles
coming
towards
us
what
passengers
they
had
*NL*
seen
in
other
coaches
and
vehicles
that
were
in
advance
.
Their
*NL*
replies
did
not
encourage
him
.
He
always
gave
me
a
reassuring
beck
of
*NL*
his
finger
and
lift
of
his
eyelid
as
he
got
upon
the
box
again
,
but
*NL*
he
seemed
perplexed
now
when
he
said
,
``
Get
on
,
my
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
when
we
were
changing
,
he
told
me
that
he
had
lost
the
track
*NL*
of
the
dress
so
long
that
he
began
to
be
surprised
.
It
was
nothing
,
*NL*
he
said
,
to
lose
such
a
track
for
one
while
,
and
to
take
it
up
for
*NL*
another
while
,
and
so
on
;
but
it
had
disappeared
here
in
an
*NL*
unaccountable
manner
,
and
we
had
not
come
upon
it
since
.
This
*NL*
corroborated
the
apprehensions
I
had
formed
,
when
he
began
to
look
at
*NL*
direction-posts
,
and
to
leave
the
carriage
at
cross
roads
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
while
he
explored
them
.
But
I
was
not
to
*NL*
be
down-hearted
,
he
told
me
,
for
it
was
as
likely
as
not
that
the
*NL*
next
stage
might
set
us
right
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
stage
,
however
,
ended
as
that
one
ended
;
we
had
no
new
clue
.
*NL*
There
was
a
spacious
inn
here
,
solitary
,
but
a
comfortable
*NL*
substantial
building
,
and
as
we
drove
in
under
a
large
gateway
before
*NL*
I
knew
it
,
where
a
landlady
and
her
pretty
daughters
came
to
the
*NL*
carriage-door
,
entreating
me
to
alight
and
refresh
myself
while
the
*NL*
horses
were
making
ready
,
I
thought
it
would
be
uncharitable
to
*NL*
refuse
.
They
took
me
upstairs
to
a
warm
room
and
left
me
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
corner
of
the
house
,
I
remember
,
looking
two
ways
.
On
*NL*
one
side
to
a
stable-yard
open
to
a
by-road
,
where
the
ostlers
were
*NL*
unharnessing
the
splashed
and
tired
horses
from
the
muddy
carriage
,
*NL*
and
beyond
that
to
the
by-road
itself
,
across
which
the
sign
was
*NL*
heavily
swinging
;
on
the
other
side
to
a
wood
of
dark
pine-trees
.
*NL*
Their
branches
were
encumbered
with
snow
,
and
it
silently
dropped
off
*NL*
in
wet
heaps
while
I
stood
at
the
window
.
Night
was
setting
in
,
and
*NL*
its
bleakness
was
enhanced
by
the
contrast
of
the
pictured
fire
*NL*
glowing
and
gleaming
in
the
window-pane
.
As
I
looked
among
the
stems
*NL*
of
the
trees
and
followed
the
discoloured
marks
in
the
snow
where
the
*NL*
thaw
was
sinking
into
it
and
undermining
it
,
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
motherly
face
brightly
set
off
by
daughters
that
had
just
now
*NL*
welcomed
me
and
of
MY
mother
lying
down
in
such
a
wood
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
frightened
when
I
found
them
all
about
me
,
but
I
remembered
*NL*
that
before
I
fainted
I
tried
very
hard
not
to
do
it
;
and
that
was
*NL*
some
little
comfort
.
They
cushioned
me
up
on
a
large
sofa
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
then
the
comely
landlady
told
me
that
I
must
travel
no
*NL*
further
to-night
,
but
must
go
to
bed
.
But
this
put
me
into
such
a
*NL*
tremble
lest
they
should
detain
me
there
that
she
soon
recalled
her
*NL*
words
and
compromised
for
a
rest
of
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
endearing
creature
she
was
.
She
and
her
three
fair
girls
,
all
*NL*
so
busy
about
me
.
I
was
to
take
hot
soup
and
broiled
fowl
,
while
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
dried
himself
and
dined
elsewhere
;
but
I
could
not
do
it
when
*NL*
a
snug
round
table
was
presently
spread
by
the
fireside
,
though
I
was
*NL*
very
unwilling
to
disappoint
them
.
However
,
I
could
take
some
toast
*NL*
and
some
hot
negus
,
and
as
I
really
enjoyed
that
refreshment
,
it
made
*NL*
some
recompense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Punctual
to
the
time
,
at
the
half-hour
's
end
the
carriage
came
*NL*
rumbling
under
the
gateway
,
and
they
took
me
down
,
warmed
,
refreshed
,
*NL*
comforted
by
kindness
,
and
safe
-LRB-
I
assured
them
-RRB-
not
to
faint
any
*NL*
more
.
After
I
had
got
in
and
had
taken
a
grateful
leave
of
them
all
,
*NL*
the
youngest
daughter
--
a
blooming
girl
of
nineteen
,
who
was
to
be
the
*NL*
first
married
,
they
had
told
me
--
got
upon
the
carriage
step
,
reached
*NL*
in
,
and
kissed
me
.
I
have
never
seen
her
,
from
that
hour
,
but
I
think
*NL*
of
her
to
this
hour
as
my
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
transparent
windows
with
the
fire
and
light
,
looking
so
bright
*NL*
and
warm
from
the
cold
darkness
out
of
doors
,
were
soon
gone
,
and
*NL*
again
we
were
crushing
and
churning
the
loose
snow
.
We
went
on
with
*NL*
toil
enough
,
but
the
dismal
roads
were
not
much
worse
than
they
had
*NL*
been
,
and
the
stage
was
only
nine
miles
.
My
companion
smoking
on
the
*NL*
box
--
I
had
thought
at
the
last
inn
of
begging
him
to
do
so
when
I
saw
*NL*
him
standing
at
a
great
fire
in
a
comfortable
cloud
of
tobacco
--
was
*NL*
as
vigilant
as
ever
and
as
quickly
down
and
up
again
when
we
came
to
*NL*
any
human
abode
or
any
human
creature
.
He
had
lighted
his
little
dark
*NL*
lantern
,
which
seemed
to
be
a
favourite
with
him
,
for
we
had
lamps
to
*NL*
the
carriage
;
and
every
now
and
then
he
turned
it
upon
me
to
see
that
*NL*
I
was
doing
well
.
There
was
a
folding-window
to
the
carriage-head
,
*NL*
but
I
never
closed
it
,
for
it
seemed
like
shutting
out
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
to
the
end
of
the
stage
,
and
still
the
lost
trace
was
not
*NL*
recovered
.
I
looked
at
him
anxiously
when
we
stopped
to
change
,
but
I
*NL*
knew
by
his
yet
graver
face
as
he
stood
watching
the
ostlers
that
he
*NL*
had
heard
nothing
.
Almost
in
an
instant
afterwards
,
as
I
leaned
back
*NL*
in
my
seat
,
he
looked
in
,
with
his
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
,
an
*NL*
excited
and
quite
different
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
I
,
starting
.
``
Is
she
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
Do
n't
deceive
yourself
,
my
dear
.
Nobody
's
here
.
But
I
've
got
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crystallized
snow
was
in
his
eyelashes
,
in
his
hair
,
lying
in
*NL*
ridges
on
his
dress
.
He
had
to
shake
it
from
his
face
and
get
his
*NL*
breath
before
he
spoke
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
he
,
beating
his
finger
on
the
apron
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
you
be
disappointed
at
what
I
'm
a-going
to
do
.
You
know
me
.
*NL*
I
'm
Inspector
Bucket
,
and
you
can
trust
me
.
We
've
come
a
long
way
;
*NL*
never
mind
.
Four
horses
out
there
for
the
next
stage
up
!
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
commotion
in
the
yard
,
and
a
man
came
running
out
of
the
*NL*
stables
to
know
if
he
meant
up
or
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
,
I
tell
you
!
Up
!
Ai
n't
it
English
?
Up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
?
''
said
I
,
astonished
.
``
To
London
!
Are
we
going
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
answered
,
``
back
.
Straight
back
as
a
die

You
*NL*
know
me

Do
n't
be
afraid

'll
follow
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

''
I
repeated
.
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
called
her
Jenny
,
did
n't
you

I
'll
follow

Bring
those
two
*NL*
pair
out
here
for
a
crown
a
man

Wake
up
,
some
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
desert
this
lady
we
are
in
search
of
;
you
will
not
*NL*
abandon
her
on
such
a
night
and
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
I
know
her
*NL*
to
be
in
!
''
said
I
,
in
an
agony
,
and
grasping
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
my
dear
,
I
wo
n't
.
But
I
'll
follow
the
other

Look
*NL*
alive
here
with
them
horses
.
Send
a
man
for
`
ard
in
the
saddle
to
the
*NL*
next
stage
,
and
let
him
send
another
for
`

again
,
and
order
four
*NL*
on
,
up
,
right
through
.
My
darling
,
do
n't
you
be
afraid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
orders
and
the
way
in
which
he
ran
about
the
yard
urging
them
*NL*
caused
a
general
excitement
that
was
scarcely
less
bewildering
to
me
*NL*
than
the
sudden
change
.
But
in
the
height
of
the
confusion
,
a
mounted
*NL*
man
galloped
away
to
order
the
relays
,
and
our
horses
were
put
to
*NL*
with
great
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
jumping
to
his
seat
and
looking
in
again
,
*NL*
''
--
you
'll
excuse
me
if
I
'm
too
familiar

do
n't
you
fret
and
worry
*NL*
yourself
no
more
than
you
can
help
.
I
say
nothing
else
at
present
;
*NL*
but
you
know
me
,
my
dear
;
now
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
endeavoured
to
say
that
I
knew
he
was
far
more
capable
than
I
of
*NL*
deciding
what
we
ought
to
do
,
but
was
he
sure
that
this
was
right
?
*NL*
Could
I
not
go
forward
by
myself
in
search
of
--
I
grasped
his
hand
*NL*
again
in
my
distress
and
whispered
it
to
him
--
of
my
own
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
and
would
I
put
you
wrong

Now

*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
say
but
yes
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
keep
up
as
good
a
heart
as
you
can
,
and

no

Now

right
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
Off
she
goes
,
then
.
And
get
on

my
lads

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
again
upon
the
melancholy
road
by
which
we
had
come
,
tearing
*NL*
up
the
miry
sleet
and
thawing
snow
as
if
they
were
torn
up
by
a
*NL*
waterwheel

CHAPTER
LVIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
Wintry
Day
and
Night
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Still
impassive
,
as
behoves
its
breeding
,
the
Dedlock
town
house
*NL*
carries
itself
as
usual
towards
the
street
of
dismal
grandeur
.
There
*NL*
are
powdered
heads
from
time
to
time
in
the
little
windows
of
the
*NL*
hall
,
looking
out
at
the
untaxed
powder
falling
all
day
from
the
sky
;
*NL*
and
in
the
same
conservatory
there
is
peach
blossom
turning
itself
*NL*
exotically
to
the
great
hall
fire
from
the
nipping
weather
out
of
*NL*
doors
.
It
is
given
out
that
my
Lady
has
gone
down
into
Lincolnshire
,
*NL*
but
is
expected
to
return
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rumour
,
busy
overmuch
,
however
,
will
not
go
down
into
Lincolnshire
.
*NL*
It
persists
in
flitting
and
chattering
about
town
.
It
knows
that
that
*NL*
poor
unfortunate
man
,
Sir
Leicester
,
has
been
sadly
used
.
It
hears
,
*NL*
my
dear
child
,
all
sorts
of
shocking
things
.
It
makes
the
world
of
*NL*
five
miles
round
quite
merry
.
Not
to
know
that
there
is
something
*NL*
wrong
at
the
Dedlocks
'
is
to
augur
yourself
unknown
.
One
of
the
*NL*
peachy-cheeked
charmers
with
the
skeleton
throats
is
already
apprised
*NL*
of
all
the
principal
circumstances
that
will
come
out
before
the
*NL*
Lords
on
Sir
Leicester
's
application
for
a
bill
of
divorce
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Blaze
and
Sparkle
's
the
jewellers
and
at
Sheen
and
Gloss
's
the
*NL*
mercers
,
it
is
and
will
be
for
several
hours
the
topic
of
the
age
,
*NL*
the
feature
of
the
century
.
The
patronesses
of
those
establishments
,
*NL*
albeit
so
loftily
inscrutable
,
being
as
nicely
weighed
and
measured
*NL*
there
as
any
other
article
of
the
stock-in-trade
,
are
perfectly
*NL*
understood
in
this
new
fashion
by
the
rawest
hand
behind
the
counter
.
*NL*
``
Our
people
,
Mr.
Jones
,
''
said
Blaze
and
Sparkle
to
the
hand
in
*NL*
question
on
engaging
him
,
``
our
people
,
sir
,
are
sheep
--
mere
sheep
.
*NL*
Where
two
or
three
marked
ones
go
,
all
the
rest
follow
.
Keep
those
*NL*
two
or
three
in
your
eye
,
Mr.
Jones
,
and
you
have
the
flock
.
''
So
,
*NL*
likewise
,
Sheen
and
Gloss
to
THEIR
Jones
,
in
reference
to
knowing
*NL*
where
to
have
the
fashionable
people
and
how
to
bring
what
they
*NL*
-LRB-
Sheen
and
Gloss
-RRB-
choose
into
fashion
.
On
similar
unerring
*NL*
principles
,
Mr.
Sladdery
the
librarian
,
and
indeed
the
great
farmer
*NL*
of
gorgeous
sheep
,
admits
this
very
day
,
``
Why
yes
,
sir
,
there
*NL*
certainly
ARE
reports
concerning
Lady
Dedlock
,
very
current
indeed
*NL*
among
my
high
connexion
,
sir
.
You
see
,
my
high
connexion
must
talk
*NL*
about
something
,
sir
;
and
it
's
only
to
get
a
subject
into
vogue
with
*NL*
one
or
two
ladies
I
could
name
to
make
it
go
down
with
the
whole
.
*NL*
Just
what
I
should
have
done
with
those
ladies
,
sir
,
in
the
case
of
*NL*
any
novelty
you
had
left
to
me
to
bring
in
,
they
have
done
of
*NL*
themselves
in
this
case
through
knowing
Lady
Dedlock
and
being
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
innocently
jealous
of
her
too
,
sir
.
You
'll
find
,
*NL*
sir
,
that
this
topic
will
be
very
popular
among
my
high
connexion
.
If
*NL*
it
had
been
a
speculation
,
sir
,
it
would
have
brought
money
.
And
when
*NL*
I
say
so
,
you
may
trust
to
my
being
right
,
sir
,
for
I
have
made
it
my
*NL*
business
to
study
my
high
connexion
and
to
be
able
to
wind
it
up
like
*NL*
a
clock
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
rumour
thrives
in
the
capital
,
and
will
not
go
down
into
*NL*
Lincolnshire
.
By
half-past
five
,
post
meridian
,
Horse
Guards
'
time
,
*NL*
it
has
even
elicited
a
new
remark
from
the
Honourable
Mr.
Stables
,
*NL*
which
bids
fair
to
outshine
the
old
one
,
on
which
he
has
so
long
*NL*
rested
his
colloquial
reputation
.
This
sparkling
sally
is
to
the
*NL*
effect
that
although
he
always
knew
she
was
the
best-groomed
woman
in
*NL*
the
stud
,
he
had
no
idea
she
was
a
bolter
.
It
is
immensely
received
*NL*
in
turf-circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
feasts
and
festivals
also
,
in
firmaments
she
has
often
graced
,
and
*NL*
among
constellations
she
outshone
but
yesterday
,
she
is
still
the
*NL*
prevalent
subject

What
is
it
?
Who
is
it
?
When
was
it
?
Where
was
it
?
*NL*
How
was
it
?
She
is
discussed
by
her
dear
friends
with
all
the
*NL*
genteelest
slang
in
vogue
,
with
the
last
new
word
,
the
last
new
*NL*
manner
,
the
last
new
drawl
,
and
the
perfection
of
polite
*NL*
indifference
.
A
remarkable
feature
of
the
theme
is
that
it
is
found
*NL*
to
be
so
inspiring
that
several
people
come
out
upon
it
who
never
*NL*
came
out
before
--
positively
say
things
!
William
Buffy
carries
one
of
*NL*
these
smartnesses
from
the
place
where
he
dines
down
to
the
House
,
*NL*
where
the
Whip
for
his
party
hands
it
about
with
his
snuff-box
to
*NL*
keep
men
together
who
want
to
be
off
,
with
such
effect
that
the
*NL*
Speaker
-LRB-
who
has
had
it
privately
insinuated
into
his
own
ear
under
*NL*
the
corner
of
his
wig
-RRB-
cries
,
``
Order
at
the
bar
!
''
three
times
without
*NL*
making
an
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
the
least
amazing
circumstance
connected
with
her
being
*NL*
vaguely
the
town
talk
is
that
people
hovering
on
the
confines
of
Mr.
*NL*
Sladdery
's
high
connexion
,
people
who
know
nothing
and
ever
did
know
*NL*
nothing
about
her
,
think
it
essential
to
their
reputation
to
pretend
*NL*
that
she
is
their
topic
too
,
and
to
retail
her
at
second-hand
with
*NL*
the
last
new
word
and
the
last
new
manner
,
and
the
last
new
drawl
,
*NL*
and
the
last
new
polite
indifference
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
all
at
*NL*
second-hand
but
considered
equal
to
new
in
inferior
systems
and
to
*NL*
fainter
stars
.
If
there
be
any
man
of
letters
,
art
,
or
science
among
*NL*
these
little
dealers
,
how
noble
in
him
to
support
the
feeble
sisters
*NL*
on
such
majestic
crutches
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
goes
the
wintry
day
outside
the
Dedlock
mansion
.
How
within
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
,
lying
in
his
bed
,
can
speak
a
little
,
though
with
*NL*
difficulty
and
indistinctness
.
He
is
enjoined
to
silence
and
to
rest
,
*NL*
and
they
have
given
him
some
opiate
to
lull
his
pain
,
for
his
old
*NL*
enemy
is
very
hard
with
him
.
He
is
never
asleep
,
though
sometimes
he
*NL*
seems
to
fall
into
a
dull
waking
doze
.
He
caused
his
bedstead
to
be
*NL*
moved
out
nearer
to
the
window
when
he
heard
it
was
such
inclement
*NL*
weather
,
and
his
head
to
be
so
adjusted
that
he
could
see
the
driving
*NL*
snow
and
sleet
.
He
watches
it
as
it
falls
,
throughout
the
whole
*NL*
wintry
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
least
noise
in
the
house
,
which
is
kept
hushed
,
his
hand
is
*NL*
at
the
pencil
.
The
old
housekeeper
,
sitting
by
him
,
knows
what
he
*NL*
would
write
and
whispers
,
``
No
,
he
has
not
come
back
yet
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
.
It
was
late
last
night
when
he
went
.
He
has
been
but
a
*NL*
little
time
gone
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
withdraws
his
hand
and
falls
to
looking
at
the
sleet
and
snow
*NL*
again
until
they
seem
,
by
being
long
looked
at
,
to
fall
so
thick
and
*NL*
fast
that
he
is
obliged
to
close
his
eyes
for
a
minute
on
the
giddy
*NL*
whirl
of
white
flakes
and
icy
blots
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
look
at
them
as
soon
as
it
was
light
.
The
day
is
not
yet
*NL*
far
spent
when
he
conceives
it
to
be
necessary
that
her
rooms
should
*NL*
be
prepared
for
her
.
It
is
very
cold
and
wet
.
Let
there
be
good
*NL*
fires
.
Let
them
know
that
she
is
expected
.
Please
see
to
it
yourself
.
*NL*
He
writes
to
this
purpose
on
his
slate
,
and
Mrs.
Rouncewell
with
a
*NL*
heavy
heart
obeys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
I
dread
,
George
,
''
the
old
lady
says
to
her
son
,
who
waits
below
*NL*
to
keep
her
company
when
she
has
a
little
leisure
,
``
I
dread
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
that
my
Lady
will
never
more
set
foot
within
these
walls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
bad
presentiment
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
yet
within
the
walls
of
Chesney
Wold
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
worse
.
But
why
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
saw
my
Lady
yesterday
,
George
,
she
looked
to
me
--
and
I
may
*NL*
say
at
me
too
--
as
if
the
step
on
the
Ghost
's
Walk
had
almost
walked
*NL*
her
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
You
alarm
yourself
with
old-story
fears
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
I
do
n't

my

No
I
do
n't

It
's
going
on
for
sixty
year
that
I
*NL*
have
been
in
this
family
,
and
I
never
had
any
fears
for
it
before
.
*NL*
But
it
's
breaking
up
,
my
dear
;
the
great
old
Dedlock
family
is
*NL*
breaking
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thankful
I
have
lived
long
enough
to
be
with
Sir
Leicester
in
*NL*
this
illness

trouble

I
know
I
am
not
too
old
nor
too
useless
*NL*
to
be
a
welcomer

to
him
than
anybody
else
in
my
place
would
be
.
*NL*
But
the
step
on
the
Ghost
's
Walk
will
walk
my
Lady
down
,
George
;
it
*NL*
has
been
many
a
day
behind
her
,
and
now
it
will
pass
her
and
go
on
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I

again
,
I
hope
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
do
I
,
George
,
''
the
old
lady
returns
,
shaking
her
head
and
*NL*
parting
her
folded
hands
.
``
But
if
my
fears
come
true

has

know
it

who
will
tell
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
these
her
rooms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
my

's
rooms
,
just
as
she
left
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
now
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
glancing
round
him
and
speaking
in
a
*NL*
lower
voice
,
``
I
begin
to
understand
how
you
come
to
think
as
you
do
*NL*
think
,
mother
.
Rooms
get
an
awful
look
about
them
when
they
are
*NL*
fitted
up
,
like
these
,
for
one
person
you
are
used
to
see
in
them
,
*NL*
and
that
person
is
away
under
any
shadow
,
let
alone
being
God
knows
*NL*
where
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
not
far
out
.
As
all
partings
foreshadow
the
great
final
one
,
*NL*
so
,
empty
rooms
,
bereft
of
a
familiar
presence
,
mournfully
whisper
*NL*
what
your
room
and
what
mine
must
one
day
be
.
My
Lady
's
state
has
a
*NL*
hollow
look
,
thus
gloomy
and
abandoned
;
and
in
the
inner
apartment
,
*NL*
where
Mr.
Bucket
last
night
made
his
secret
perquisition
,
the
traces
*NL*
of
her
dresses
and
her
ornaments
,
even
the
mirrors
accustomed
to
*NL*
reflect
them
when
they
were
a
portion
of
herself
,
have
a
desolate
and
*NL*
vacant
air
.
Dark
and
cold
as
the
wintry
day
is
,
it
is
darker
and
*NL*
colder
in
these
deserted
chambers
than
in
many
a
hut
that
will
barely
*NL*
exclude
the
weather
;
and
though
the
servants
heap
fires
in
the
grates
*NL*
and
set
the
couches
and
the
chairs
within
the
warm
glass
screens
that
*NL*
let
their
ruddy
light
shoot
through
to
the
furthest
corners
,
there
is
*NL*
a
heavy
cloud
upon
the
rooms
which
no
light
will
dispel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
housekeeper
and
her
son
remain
until
the
preparations
are
*NL*
complete
,
and
then
she
returns
upstairs
.
Volumnia
has
taken
Mrs.
*NL*
Rouncewell
's
place
in
the
meantime
,
though
pearl
necklaces
and
rouge
*NL*
pots
,
however
calculated
to
embellish
Bath
,
are
but
indifferent
*NL*
comforts
to
the
invalid
under
present
circumstances
.
Volumnia
,
not
*NL*
being
supposed
to
know
-LRB-
and
indeed
not
knowing
-RRB-
what
is
the
matter
,
*NL*
has
found
it
a
ticklish
task
to
offer
appropriate
observations
and
*NL*
consequently
has
supplied
their
place
with
distracting
smoothings
of
*NL*
the
bed-linen
,
elaborate
locomotion
on
tiptoe
,
vigilant
peeping
at
*NL*
her
kinsman
's
eyes
,
and
one
exasperating
whisper
to
herself
of
,
``
He
*NL*
is
asleep
.
''
In
disproof
of
which
superfluous
remark
Sir
Leicester
has
*NL*
indignantly
written
on
the
slate
,
``
I
am
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yielding
,
therefore
,
the
chair
at
the
bedside
to
the
quaint
old
*NL*
housekeeper
,
Volumnia
sits
at
a
table
a
little
removed
,
*NL*
sympathetically
sighing
.
Sir
Leicester
watches
the
sleet
and
snow
and
*NL*
listens
for
the
returning
steps
that
he
expects
.
In
the
ears
of
his
*NL*
old
servant
,
looking
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
of
an
old
*NL*
picture-frame
to
attend
a
summoned
Dedlock
to
another
world
,
the
*NL*
silence
is
fraught
with
echoes
of
her
own
words
,
``
Who
will
tell
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
been
under
his
valet
's
hands
this
morning
to
be
made
*NL*
presentable
and
is
as
well
got
up
as
the
circumstances
will
allow
.
He
*NL*
is
propped
with
pillows
,
his
grey
hair
is
brushed
in
its
usual
*NL*
manner
,
his
linen
is
arranged
to
a
nicety
,
and
he
is
wrapped
in
a
*NL*
responsible
dressing-gown
.
His
eye-glass
and
his
watch
are
ready
to
*NL*
his
hand
.
It
is
necessary
--
less
to
his
own
dignity
now
perhaps
than
*NL*
for
her
sake
--
that
he
should
be
seen
as
little
disturbed
and
as
much
*NL*
himself
as
may
be
.
Women
will
talk
,
and
Volumnia
,
though
a
Dedlock
,
*NL*
is
no
exceptional
case
.
He
keeps
her
here
,
there
is
little
doubt
,
to
*NL*
prevent
her
talking
somewhere
else
.
He
is
very
ill
,
but
he
makes
his
*NL*
present
stand
against
distress
of
mind
and
body
most
courageously
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fair
Volumnia
,
being
one
of
those
sprightly
girls
who
can
not
long
*NL*
continue
silent
without
imminent
peril
of
seizure
by
the
dragon
*NL*
Boredom
,
soon
indicates
the
approach
of
that
monster
with
a
series
of
*NL*
undisguisable
yawns
.
Finding
it
impossible
to
suppress
those
yawns
by
*NL*
any
other
process
than
conversation
,
she
compliments
Mrs.
Rouncewell
*NL*
on
her
son
,
declaring
that
he
positively
is
one
of
the
finest
figures
*NL*
she
ever
saw
and
as
soldierly
a
looking
person
,
she
should
think
,
as
*NL*
what
's
his
name
,
her
favourite
Life
Guardsman
--
the
man
she
dotes
on
,
*NL*
the
dearest
of
creatures
--
who
was
killed
at
Waterloo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
hears
this
tribute
with
so
much
surprise
and
stares
*NL*
about
him
in
such
a
confused
way
that
Mrs.
Rouncewell
feels
it
*NL*
necessary
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dedlock
do
n't
speak
of
my
eldest
son
,
Sir
Leicester
,
but
my
*NL*
youngest
.
I
have
found
him
.
He
has
come
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
breaks
silence
with
a
harsh
cry
.
``
George
?
Your
son
*NL*
George
come
home
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
housekeeper
wipes
her
eyes
.
``
Thank
God
.
Yes
,
Sir
Leicester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Does
this
discovery
of
some
one
lost
,
this
return
of
some
one
so
long
*NL*
gone
,
come
upon
him
as
a
strong
confirmation
of
his
hopes
?
Does
he
*NL*
think
,
``
Shall
I
not
,
with
the
aid
I
have
,
recall
her
safely
after
*NL*
this
,
there
being
fewer
hours
in
her
case
than
there
are
years
in
*NL*
his
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
of
no
use
entreating
him
;
he
is
determined
to
speak
now
,
and
he
*NL*
does
.
In
a
thick
crowd
of
sounds
,
but
still
intelligibly
enough
to
be
*NL*
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happened
only
yesterday
,
Sir
Leicester
,
and
I
doubted
your
being
*NL*
well
enough
to
be
talked
to
of
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
the
giddy
Volumnia
now
remembers
with
her
little
scream
that
*NL*
nobody
was
to
have
known
of
his
being
Mrs.
Rouncewell
's
son
and
that
*NL*
she
was
not
to
have
told
.
But
Mrs.
Rouncewell
protests
,
with
warmth
*NL*
enough
to
swell
the
stomacher
,
that
of
course
she
would
have
told
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
as
soon
as
he
got
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
your
son
George
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
?
''
asks
Sir
Leicester
,
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
not
a
little
alarmed
by
his
disregard
of
the
*NL*
doctor
's
injunctions
,
replies
,
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rouncewell
is
constrained
to
admit
that
he
is
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
him
here
to
my
room
.
Bring
him
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
can
do
nothing
but
go
in
search
of
him
.
Sir
Leicester
,
*NL*
with
such
power
of
movement
as
he
has
,
arranges
himself
a
little
to
*NL*
receive
him
.
When
he
has
done
so
,
he
looks
out
again
at
the
falling
*NL*
sleet
and
snow
and
listens
again
for
the
returning
steps
.
A
quantity
*NL*
of
straw
has
been
tumbled
down
in
the
street
to
deaden
the
noises
*NL*
there
,
and
she
might
be
driven
to
the
door
perhaps
without
his
*NL*
hearing
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
lying
thus
,
apparently
forgetful
of
his
newer
and
minor
*NL*
surprise
,
when
the
housekeeper
returns
,
accompanied
by
her
trooper
*NL*
son
.
Mr.
George
approaches
softly
to
the
bedside
,
makes
his
bow
,
*NL*
squares
his
chest
,
and
stands
,
with
his
face
flushed
,
very
heartily
*NL*
ashamed
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heaven
,
and
it
is
really
George
Rouncewell
!
''
exclaims
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
.
``
Do
you
remember
me
,
George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
needs
to
look
at
him
and
to
separate
this
sound
from
that
*NL*
sound
before
he
knows
what
he
has
said
,
but
doing
this
and
being
a
*NL*
little
helped
by
his
mother
,
he
replies
,
``
I
must
have
a
very
bad
*NL*
memory
,
indeed
,
Sir
Leicester
,
if
I
failed
to
remember
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
look
at
you
,
George
Rouncewell
,
''
Sir
Leicester
observes
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
``
I
see
something
of
a
boy
at
Chesney
Wold
--
I
remember
*NL*
well
--
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looks
at
the
trooper
until
tears
come
into
his
eyes
,
and
then
he
*NL*
looks
at
the
sleet
and
snow
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Sir
Leicester
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
``
but
would
you
*NL*
accept
of
my
arms
to
raise
you
up
?
You
would
lie
easier
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
,
if
you
would
allow
me
to
move
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
George
Rouncewell
;
if
you
will
be
so
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
takes
him
in
his
arms
like
a
child
,
lightly
raises
him
,
*NL*
and
turns
him
with
his
face
more
towards
the
window
.
``
Thank
you
.
You
*NL*
have
your
mother
's
gentleness
,
''
returns
Sir
Leicester
,
``
and
your
own
*NL*
strength
.
Thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
signs
to
him
with
his
hand
not
to
go
away
.
George
quietly
remains
*NL*
at
the
bedside
,
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
wish
for
secrecy
?
''
It
takes
Sir
Leicester
some
time
to
*NL*
ask
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
I
am
not
much
to
boast
of
,
Sir
Leicester
,
and
I
--
I
should
*NL*
still
,
Sir
Leicester
,
if
you
was
not
so
indisposed
--
which
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
not
be
long
--
I
should
still
hope
for
the
favour
of
being
allowed
*NL*
to
remain
unknown
in
general
.
That
involves
explanations
not
very
*NL*
hard
to
be
guessed
at
,
not
very
well
timed
here
,
and
not
very
*NL*
creditable
to
myself
.
However
opinions
may
differ
on
a
variety
of
*NL*
subjects
,
I
should
think
it
would
be
universally
agreed
,
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
,
that
I
am
not
much
to
boast
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
a
soldier
,
''
observes
Sir
Leicester
,
``
and
a
faithful
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
makes
his
military
bow
.
``
As
far
as
that
goes
,
Sir
Leicester
,
I
*NL*
have
done
my
duty
under
discipline
,
and
it
was
the
least
I
could
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
me
,
''
says
Sir
Leicester
,
whose
eyes
are
much
attracted
*NL*
towards
him
,
``
far
from
well
,
George
Rouncewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
both
to
hear
it
and
to
see
it
,
Sir
Leicester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
are
.
No
.
In
addition
to
my
older
malady
,
I
have
had
a
*NL*
sudden
and
bad
attack
.
Something
that
deadens
,
''
making
an
endeavour
*NL*
to
pass
one
hand
down
one
side
,
``
and
confuses
,
''
touching
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
,
with
a
look
of
assent
and
sympathy
,
makes
another
bow
.
The
*NL*
different
times
when
they
were
both
young
men
-LRB-
the
trooper
much
the
*NL*
younger
of
the
two
-RRB-
and
looked
at
one
another
down
at
Chesney
Wold
*NL*
arise
before
them
both
and
soften
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
,
evidently
with
a
great
determination
to
say
,
in
his
*NL*
own
manner
,
something
that
is
on
his
mind
before
relapsing
into
*NL*
silence
,
tries
to
raise
himself
among
his
pillows
a
little
more
.
*NL*
George
,
observant
of
the
action
,
takes
him
in
his
arms
again
and
*NL*
places
him
as
he
desires
to
be
.
``
Thank
you
,
George
.
You
are
another
*NL*
self
to
me
.
You
have
often
carried
my
spare
gun
at
Chesney
Wold
,
*NL*
George
.
You
are
familiar
to
me
in
these
strange
circumstances
,
very
*NL*
familiar
.
''
He
has
put
Sir
Leicester
's
sounder
arm
over
his
shoulder
*NL*
in
lifting
him
up
,
and
Sir
Leicester
is
slow
in
drawing
it
away
again
*NL*
as
he
says
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
about
to
add
,
''
he
presently
goes
on
,
``
I
was
about
to
add
,
*NL*
respecting
this
attack
,
that
it
was
unfortunately
simultaneous
with
a
*NL*
slight
misunderstanding
between
my
Lady
and
myself
.
I
do
not
mean
*NL*
that
there
was
any
difference
between
us
-LRB-
for
there
has
been
none
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
that
there
was
a
misunderstanding
of
certain
circumstances
*NL*
important
only
to
ourselves
,
which
deprives
me
,
for
a
little
while
,
*NL*
of
my
Lady
's
society
.
She
has
found
it
necessary
to
make
a
journey
--
I
*NL*
trust
will
shortly
return
.
Volumnia
,
do
I
make
myself
intelligible
?
*NL*
The
words
are
not
quite
under
my
command
in
the
manner
of
pronouncing
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
understands
him
perfectly
,
and
in
truth
he
delivers
himself
*NL*
with
far
greater
plainness
than
could
have
been
supposed
possible
a
*NL*
minute
ago
.
The
effort
by
which
he
does
so
is
written
in
the
anxious
*NL*
and
labouring
expression
of
his
face
.
Nothing
but
the
strength
of
his
*NL*
purpose
enables
him
to
make
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
Volumnia
,
I
desire
to
say
in
your
presence
--
and
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
my
old
retainer
and
friend
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
whose
truth
*NL*
and
fidelity
no
one
can
question
,
and
in
the
presence
of
her
son
*NL*
George
,
who
comes
back
like
a
familiar
recollection
of
my
youth
in
*NL*
the
home
of
my
ancestors
at
Chesney
Wold

in
case
I
should
relapse
,

in

I
should
not
recover

in

I
should
lose
both
my
speech

the
power
of
writing
,
though
I
hope
for
better
things

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
housekeeper
weeping
silently
;
Volumnia
in
the
greatest
*NL*
agitation
,
with
the
freshest
bloom
on
her
cheeks
;
the
trooper
with
*NL*
his
arms
folded
and
his
head
a
little
bent
,
respectfully
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
I
desire
to
say
,
and
to
call
you
all
to
*NL*
witness
--
beginning
,
Volumnia
,
with
yourself
,
most
solemnly
--
that
I
am
*NL*
on
unaltered
terms
with
Lady
Dedlock
.
That
I
assert
no
cause
whatever
*NL*
of
complaint
against
her
.
That
I
have
ever
had
the
strongest
*NL*
affection
for
her
,
and
that
I
retain
it
undiminished
.
Say
this
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
to
every
one
.
If
you
ever
say
less
than
this
,
you
will
*NL*
be
guilty
of
deliberate
falsehood
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
tremblingly
protests
that
she
will
observe
his
injunctions
*NL*
to
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lady
is
too
high
in
position
,
too
handsome
,
too
accomplished
,
too
*NL*
superior
in
most
respects
to
the
best
of
those
by
whom
she
is
*NL*
surrounded
,
not
to
have
her
enemies
and
traducers
,
I
dare
say
.
Let
it
*NL*
be
known
to
them
,
as
I
make
it
known
to
you
,
that
being
of
sound
*NL*
mind
,
memory
,
and
understanding
,
I
revoke
no
disposition
I
have
made
*NL*
in
her
favour
.
I
abridge
nothing
I
have
ever
bestowed
upon
her
.
I
am
*NL*
on
unaltered
terms
with
her
,
and
I
recall
--
having
the
full
power
to
*NL*
do
it
if
I
were
so
disposed
,
as
you
see
--
no
act
I
have
done
for
her
*NL*
advantage
and
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
formal
array
of
words
might
have
at
any
other
time
,
as
it
has
*NL*
often
had
,
something
ludicrous
in
it
,
but
at
this
time
it
is
serious
*NL*
and
affecting
.
His
noble
earnestness
,
his
fidelity
,
his
gallant
*NL*
shielding
of
her
,
his
generous
conquest
of
his
own
wrong
and
his
own
*NL*
pride
for
her
sake
,
are
simply
honourable
,
manly
,
and
true
.
Nothing
*NL*
less
worthy
can
be
seen
through
the
lustre
of
such
qualities
in
the
*NL*
commonest
mechanic
,
nothing
less
worthy
can
be
seen
in
the
best-born
*NL*
gentleman
.
In
such
a
light
both
aspire
alike
,
both
rise
alike
,
both
*NL*
children
of
the
dust
shine
equally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overpowered
by
his
exertions
,
he
lays
his
head
back
on
his
pillows
*NL*
and
closes
his
eyes
for
not
more
than
a
minute
,
when
he
again
resumes
*NL*
his
watching
of
the
weather
and
his
attention
to
the
muffled
sounds
.
*NL*
In
the
rendering
of
those
little
services
,
and
in
the
manner
of
their
*NL*
acceptance
,
the
trooper
has
become
installed
as
necessary
to
him
.
*NL*
Nothing
has
been
said
,
but
it
is
quite
understood
.
He
falls
a
step
or
*NL*
two
backward
to
be
out
of
sight
and
mounts
guard
a
little
behind
his
*NL*
mother
's
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
is
now
beginning
to
decline
.
The
mist
and
the
sleet
into
*NL*
which
the
snow
has
all
resolved
itself
are
darker
,
and
the
blaze
*NL*
begins
to
tell
more
vividly
upon
the
room
walls
and
furniture
.
The
*NL*
gloom
augments
;
the
bright
gas
springs
up
in
the
streets
;
and
the
*NL*
pertinacious
oil
lamps
which
yet
hold
their
ground
there
,
with
their
*NL*
source
of
life
half
frozen
and
half
thawed
,
twinkle
gaspingly
like
*NL*
fiery
fish
out
of
water
--
as
they
are
.
The
world
,
which
has
been
*NL*
rumbling
over
the
straw
and
pulling
at
the
bell
,
``
to
inquire
,
''
begins
*NL*
to
go
home
,
begins
to
dress
,
to
dine
,
to
discuss
its
dear
friend
with
*NL*
all
the
last
new
modes
,
as
already
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
does
Sir
Leicester
become
worse
,
restless
,
uneasy
,
and
in
great
*NL*
pain
.
Volumnia
,
lighting
a
candle
-LRB-
with
a
predestined
aptitude
for
*NL*
doing
something
objectionable
-RRB-
,
is
bidden
to
put
it
out
again
,
for
it
*NL*
is
not
yet
dark
enough
.
Yet
it
is
very
dark
too
,
as
dark
as
it
will
*NL*
be
all
night
.
By
and
by
she
tries
again
.
No
!
Put
it
out
.
It
is
not
*NL*
dark
enough
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
old
housekeeper
is
the
first
to
understand
that
he
is
striving
to
*NL*
uphold
the
fiction
with
himself
that
it
is
not
growing
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Sir
Leicester
,
my
honoured
master
,
''
she
softly
whispers
,
``
I
*NL*
must
,
for
your
own
good
,
and
my
duty
,
take
the
freedom
of
begging
and
*NL*
praying
that
you
will
not
lie
here
in
the
lone
darkness
watching
and
*NL*
waiting
and
dragging
through
the
time
.
Let
me
draw
the
curtains
,
and
*NL*
light
the
candles
,
and
make
things
more
comfortable
about
you
.
The
*NL*
church-clocks
will
strike
the
hours
just
the
same
,
Sir
Leicester
,
and
*NL*
the
night
will
pass
away
just
the
same
.
My
Lady
will
come
back
,
just
*NL*
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
but
I
am
weak
--
and
he
has
been
so
long
*NL*
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
very
long
,
Sir
Leicester
.
Not
twenty-four
hours
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
a
long
time
.
Oh
,
it
is
a
long
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
it
with
a
groan
that
wrings
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knows
that
this
is
not
a
period
for
bringing
the
rough
light
upon
*NL*
him
;
she
thinks
his
tears
too
sacred
to
be
seen
,
even
by
her
.
*NL*
Therefore
she
sits
in
the
darkness
for
a
while
without
a
word
,
then
*NL*
gently
begins
to
move
about
,
now
stirring
the
fire
,
now
standing
at
*NL*
the
dark
window
looking
out
.
Finally
he
tells
her
,
with
recovered
*NL*
self-command
,
``
As
you
say
,
Mrs.
Rouncewell
,
it
is
no
worse
for
being
*NL*
confessed
.
It
is
getting
late
,
and
they
are
not
come
.
Light
the
*NL*
room
!
''
When
it
is
lighted
and
the
weather
shut
out
,
it
is
only
left
*NL*
to
him
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
find
that
however
dejected
and
ill
he
is
,
he
brightens
when
*NL*
a
quiet
pretence
is
made
of
looking
at
the
fires
in
her
rooms
and
*NL*
being
sure
that
everything
is
ready
to
receive
her
.
Poor
pretence
as
*NL*
it
is
,
these
allusions
to
her
being
expected
keep
up
hope
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Midnight
comes
,
and
with
it
the
same
blank
.
The
carriages
in
the
*NL*
streets
are
few
,
and
other
late
sounds
in
that
neighbourhood
there
*NL*
are
none
,
unless
a
man
so
very
nomadically
drunk
as
to
stray
into
the
*NL*
frigid
zone
goes
brawling
and
bellowing
along
the
pavement
.
Upon
this
*NL*
wintry
night
it
is
so
still
that
listening
to
the
intense
silence
is
*NL*
like
looking
at
intense
darkness
.
If
any
distant
sound
be
audible
in
*NL*
this
case
,
it
departs
through
the
gloom
like
a
feeble
light
in
that
,
*NL*
and
all
is
heavier
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporation
of
servants
are
dismissed
to
bed
-LRB-
not
unwilling
to
*NL*
go
,
for
they
were
up
all
last
night
-RRB-
,
and
only
Mrs.
Rouncewell
and
*NL*
George
keep
watch
in
Sir
Leicester
's
room
.
As
the
night
lags
tardily
*NL*
on
--
or
rather
when
it
seems
to
stop
altogether
,
at
between
two
and
*NL*
three
o'clock
--
they
find
a
restless
craving
on
him
to
know
more
about
*NL*
the
weather
,
now
he
can
not
see
it
.
Hence
George
,
patrolling
regularly
*NL*
every
half-hour
to
the
rooms
so
carefully
looked
after
,
extends
his
*NL*
march
to
the
hall-door
,
looks
about
him
,
and
brings
back
the
best
*NL*
report
he
can
make
of
the
worst
of
nights
,
the
sleet
still
falling
*NL*
and
even
the
stone
footways
lying
ankle-deep
in
icy
sludge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
,
in
her
room
up
a
retired
landing
on
the
staircase
--
the
*NL*
second
turning
past
the
end
of
the
carving
and
gilding
,
a
cousinly
*NL*
room
containing
a
fearful
abortion
of
a
portrait
of
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
banished
for
its
crimes
,
and
commanding
in
the
day
a
solemn
yard
*NL*
planted
with
dried-up
shrubs
like
antediluvian
specimens
of
black
*NL*
tea
--
is
a
prey
to
horrors
of
many
kinds
.
Not
last
nor
least
among
*NL*
them
,
possibly
,
is
a
horror
of
what
may
befall
her
little
income
in
*NL*
the
event
,
as
she
expresses
it
,
``
of
anything
happening
''
to
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
.
Anything
,
in
this
sense
,
meaning
one
thing
only
;
and
that
*NL*
the
last
thing
that
can
happen
to
the
consciousness
of
any
baronet
in
*NL*
the
known
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
effect
of
these
horrors
is
that
Volumnia
finds
she
can
not
go
to
*NL*
bed
in
her
own
room
or
sit
by
the
fire
in
her
own
room
,
but
must
come
*NL*
forth
with
her
fair
head
tied
up
in
a
profusion
of
shawl
,
and
her
*NL*
fair
form
enrobed
in
drapery
,
and
parade
the
mansion
like
a
ghost
,
*NL*
particularly
haunting
the
rooms
,
warm
and
luxurious
,
prepared
for
one
*NL*
who
still
does
not
return
.
Solitude
under
such
circumstances
being
*NL*
not
to
be
thought
of
,
Volumnia
is
attended
by
her
maid
,
who
,
*NL*
impressed
from
her
own
bed
for
that
purpose
,
extremely
cold
,
very
*NL*
sleepy
,
and
generally
an
injured
maid
as
condemned
by
circumstances
*NL*
to
take
office
with
a
cousin
,
when
she
had
resolved
to
be
maid
to
*NL*
nothing
less
than
ten
thousand
a
year
,
has
not
a
sweet
expression
of
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
periodical
visits
of
the
trooper
to
these
rooms
,
however
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
his
patrolling
is
an
assurance
of
protection
and
company
*NL*
both
to
mistress
and
maid
,
which
renders
them
very
acceptable
in
the
*NL*
small
hours
of
the
night
.
Whenever
he
is
heard
advancing
,
they
both
*NL*
make
some
little
decorative
preparation
to
receive
him
;
at
other
*NL*
times
they
divide
their
watches
into
short
scraps
of
oblivion
and
*NL*
dialogues
not
wholly
free
from
acerbity
,
as
to
whether
Miss
Dedlock
,
*NL*
sitting
with
her
feet
upon
the
fender
,
was
or
was
not
falling
into
*NL*
the
fire
when
rescued
-LRB-
to
her
great
displeasure
-RRB-
by
her
guardian
*NL*
genius
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Sir
Leicester
now
,
Mr.
George
?
''
inquires
Volumnia
,
adjusting
*NL*
her
cowl
over
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Sir
Leicester
is
much
the
same
,
miss
.
He
is
very
low
and
ill
,
*NL*
and
he
even
wanders
a
little
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
asked
for
me
?
''
inquires
Volumnia
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
I
ca
n't
say
he
has
,
miss
.
Not
within
my
hearing
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
truly
sad
time
,
Mr.
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indeed
,
miss
.
Had
n't
you
better
go
to
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
a
deal
better
go
to
bed
,
Miss
Dedlock
,
''
quoth
the
maid
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Volumnia
answers
No
!
No
!
She
may
be
asked
for
,
she
may
be
wanted
*NL*
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
She
never
should
forgive
herself
``
if
anything
*NL*
was
to
happen
''
and
she
was
not
on
the
spot
.
She
declines
to
enter
on
*NL*
the
question
,
mooted
by
the
maid
,
how
the
spot
comes
to
be
there
,
and
*NL*
not
in
her
room
-LRB-
which
is
nearer
to
Sir
Leicester
's
-RRB-
,
but
staunchly
*NL*
declares
that
on
the
spot
she
will
remain
.
Volumnia
further
makes
a
*NL*
merit
of
not
having
``
closed
an
eye
''
--
as
if
she
had
twenty
or
*NL*
thirty
--
though
it
is
hard
to
reconcile
this
statement
with
her
having
*NL*
most
indisputably
opened
two
within
five
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
it
comes
to
four
o'clock
,
and
still
the
same
blank
,
*NL*
Volumnia
's
constancy
begins
to
fail
her
,
or
rather
it
begins
to
*NL*
strengthen
,
for
she
now
considers
that
it
is
her
duty
to
be
ready
for
*NL*
the
morrow
,
when
much
may
be
expected
of
her
,
that
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
howsoever
anxious
to
remain
upon
the
spot
,
it
may
be
required
of
her
,
*NL*
as
an
act
of
self-devotion
,
to
desert
the
spot
.
So
when
the
trooper
*NL*
reappears
with
his
,
``
Had
n't
you
better
go
to
bed
,
miss
?
''
and
when
the
*NL*
maid
protests
,
more
sharply
than
before
,
``
You
had
a
deal
better
go
to
*NL*
bed
,
Miss
Dedlock
!
''
she
meekly
rises
and
says
,
``
Do
with
me
what
you
*NL*
think
best
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
undoubtedly
thinks
it
best
to
escort
her
on
his
arm
to
the
*NL*
door
of
her
cousinly
chamber
,
and
the
maid
as
undoubtedly
thinks
it
*NL*
best
to
hustle
her
into
bed
with
mighty
little
ceremony
.
Accordingly
,
*NL*
these
steps
are
taken
;
and
now
the
trooper
,
in
his
rounds
,
has
the
*NL*
house
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
improvement
in
the
weather
.
From
the
portico
,
from
the
*NL*
eaves
,
from
the
parapet
,
from
every
ledge
and
post
and
pillar
,
drips
*NL*
the
thawed
snow
.
It
has
crept
,
as
if
for
shelter
,
into
the
lintels
of
*NL*
the
great
door
--
under
it
,
into
the
corners
of
the
windows
,
into
every
*NL*
chink
and
crevice
of
retreat
,
and
there
wastes
and
dies
.
It
is
*NL*
falling
still
;
upon
the
roof
,
upon
the
skylight
,
even
through
the
*NL*
skylight
,
and
drip
,
drip
,
drip
,
with
the
regularity
of
the
Ghost
's
*NL*
Walk
,
on
the
stone
floor
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
,
his
old
recollections
awakened
by
the
solitary
grandeur
*NL*
of
a
great
house
--
no
novelty
to
him
once
at
Chesney
Wold
--
goes
up
the
*NL*
stairs
and
through
the
chief
rooms
,
holding
up
his
light
at
arm
's
*NL*
length
.
Thinking
of
his
varied
fortunes
within
the
last
few
weeks
,
*NL*
and
of
his
rustic
boyhood
,
and
of
the
two
periods
of
his
life
so
*NL*
strangely
brought
together
across
the
wide
intermediate
space
;
*NL*
thinking
of
the
murdered
man
whose
image
is
fresh
in
his
mind
;
*NL*
thinking
of
the
lady
who
has
disappeared
from
these
very
rooms
and
*NL*
the
tokens
of
whose
recent
presence
are
all
here
;
thinking
of
the
*NL*
master
of
the
house
upstairs
and
of
the
foreboding
,
``
Who
will
tell
*NL*
him
!
''
he
looks
here
and
looks
there
,
and
reflects
how
he
MIGHT
see
*NL*
something
now
,
which
it
would
tax
his
boldness
to
walk
up
to
,
lay
his
*NL*
hand
upon
,
and
prove
to
be
a
fancy
.
But
it
is
all
blank
,
blank
as
the
*NL*
darkness
above
and
below
,
while
he
goes
up
the
great
staircase
again
,
*NL*
blank
as
the
oppressive
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
still
in
readiness
,
George
Rouncewell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
orderly
and
right
,
Sir
Leicester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
word
of
any
kind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
shakes
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
letter
that
can
possibly
have
been
overlooked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
knows
there
is
no
such
hope
as
that
and
lays
his
head
down
*NL*
without
looking
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
familiar
to
him
,
as
he
said
himself
some
hours
ago
,
George
*NL*
Rouncewell
lifts
him
into
easier
positions
through
the
long
remainder
*NL*
of
the
blank
wintry
night
,
and
equally
familiar
with
his
unexpressed
*NL*
wish
,
extinguishes
the
light
and
undraws
the
curtains
at
the
first
*NL*
late
break
of
day
.
The
day
comes
like
a
phantom
.
Cold
,
colourless
,
*NL*
and
vague
,
it
sends
a
warning
streak
before
it
of
a
deathlike
hue
,
as
*NL*
if
it
cried
out
,
``
Look
what
I
am
bringing
you
who
watch
there
!
Who
*NL*
will
tell
him
!

CHAPTER
LIX
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
the
houses
outside
London
*NL*
did
at
last
begin
to
exclude
the
country
and
to
close
us
in
with
*NL*
streets
.
We
had
made
our
way
along
roads
in
a
far
worse
condition
*NL*
than
when
we
had
traversed
them
by
daylight
,
both
the
fall
and
the
*NL*
thaw
having
lasted
ever
since
;
but
the
energy
of
my
companion
never
*NL*
slackened
.
It
had
only
been
,
as
I
thought
,
of
less
assistance
than
*NL*
the
horses
in
getting
us
on
,
and
it
had
often
aided
them
.
They
had
*NL*
stopped
exhausted
half-way
up
hills
,
they
had
been
driven
through
*NL*
streams
of
turbulent
water
,
they
had
slipped
down
and
become
*NL*
entangled
with
the
harness
;
but
he
and
his
little
lantern
had
been
*NL*
always
ready
,
and
when
the
mishap
was
set
right
,
I
had
never
heard
*NL*
any
variation
in
his
cool
,
``
Get
on
,
my
lads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
steadiness
and
confidence
with
which
he
had
directed
our
journey
*NL*
back
I
could
not
account
for
.
Never
wavering
,
he
never
even
stopped
*NL*
to
make
an
inquiry
until
we
were
within
a
few
miles
of
London
.
A
very
*NL*
few
words
,
here
and
there
,
were
then
enough
for
him
;
and
thus
we
*NL*
came
,
at
between
three
and
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
into
*NL*
Islington
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
dwell
on
the
suspense
and
anxiety
with
which
I
reflected
*NL*
all
this
time
that
we
were
leaving
my
mother
farther
and
farther
*NL*
behind
every
minute
.
I
think
I
had
some
strong
hope
that
he
must
be
*NL*
right
and
could
not
fail
to
have
a
satisfactory
object
in
following
*NL*
this
woman
,
but
I
tormented
myself
with
questioning
it
and
discussing
*NL*
it
during
the
whole
journey
.
What
was
to
ensue
when
we
found
her
and
*NL*
what
could
compensate
us
for
this
loss
of
time
were
questions
also
*NL*
that
I
could
not
possibly
dismiss
;
my
mind
was
quite
tortured
by
long
*NL*
dwelling
on
such
reflections
when
we
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
in
a
high-street
where
there
was
a
coach-stand
.
My
*NL*
companion
paid
our
two
drivers
,
who
were
as
completely
covered
with
*NL*
splashes
as
if
they
had
been
dragged
along
the
roads
like
the
*NL*
carriage
itself
,
and
giving
them
some
brief
direction
where
to
take
*NL*
it
,
lifted
me
out
of
it
and
into
a
hackney-coach
he
had
chosen
from
*NL*
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
!
''
he
said
as
he
did
this
.
``
How
wet
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
conscious
of
it
.
But
the
melted
snow
had
found
its
way
*NL*
into
the
carriage
,
and
I
had
got
out
two
or
three
times
when
a
fallen
*NL*
horse
was
plunging
and
had
to
be
got
up
,
and
the
wet
had
penetrated
*NL*
my
dress
.
I
assured
him
it
was
no
matter
,
but
the
driver
,
who
knew
*NL*
him
,
would
not
be
dissuaded
by
me
from
running
down
the
street
to
his
*NL*
stable
,
whence
he
brought
an
armful
of
clean
dry
straw
.
They
shook
it
*NL*
out
and
strewed
it
well
about
me
,
and
I
found
it
warm
and
*NL*
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
with
his
head
in
at
the
window
after
*NL*
I
was
shut
up
.
``
We
're
a-going
to
mark
this
person
down
.
It
may
take
a
*NL*
little
time
,
but
you
do
n't
mind
that
.
You
're
pretty
sure
that
I
've
*NL*
got
a
motive
.
Ai
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
little
thought
what
it
was
,
little
thought
in
how
short
a
time
I
*NL*
should
understand
it
better
,
but
I
assured
him
that
I
had
confidence
*NL*
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
may
have
,
my
dear
,
''
he
returned
.
``
And
I
tell
you
what
!
If
you
*NL*
only
repose
half
as
much
confidence
in
me
as
I
repose
in
you
after
*NL*
what
I
've
experienced
of
you
,
that
'll
do
.
Lord
!
You
're
no
trouble
at
*NL*
all
.
I
never
see
a
young
woman
in
any
station
of
society
--
and
I
've
*NL*
seen
many
elevated
ones
too
--
conduct
herself
like
you
have
conducted
*NL*
yourself
since
you
was
called
out
of
your
bed
.
You
're
a
pattern
,
you
*NL*
know
,
that
's
what
you
are
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
warmly
;
``
you
're
a
*NL*
pattern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
very
glad
,
as
indeed
I
was
,
to
have
been
no
*NL*
hindrance
to
him
,
and
that
I
hoped
I
should
be
none
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
he
returned
,
``
when
a
young
lady
is
as
mild
as
she
's
game
,
*NL*
and
as
game
as
she
's
mild
,
that
's
all
I
ask
,
and
more
than
I
expect
.
*NL*
She
then
becomes
a
queen
,
and
that
's
about
what
you
are
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
encouraging
words
--
they
really
were
encouraging
to
me
*NL*
under
those
lonely
and
anxious
circumstances
--
he
got
upon
the
box
,
*NL*
and
we
once
more
drove
away
.
Where
we
drove
I
neither
knew
then
nor
*NL*
have
ever
known
since
,
but
we
appeared
to
seek
out
the
narrowest
and
*NL*
worst
streets
in
London
.
Whenever
I
saw
him
directing
the
driver
,
I
*NL*
was
prepared
for
our
descending
into
a
deeper
complication
of
such
*NL*
streets
,
and
we
never
failed
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
we
emerged
upon
a
wider
thoroughfare
or
came
to
a
larger
*NL*
building
than
the
generality
,
well
lighted
.
Then
we
stopped
at
*NL*
offices
like
those
we
had
visited
when
we
began
our
journey
,
and
I
*NL*
saw
him
in
consultation
with
others
.
Sometimes
he
would
get
down
by
*NL*
an
archway
or
at
a
street
corner
and
mysteriously
show
the
light
of
*NL*
his
little
lantern
.
This
would
attract
similar
lights
from
various
*NL*
dark
quarters
,
like
so
many
insects
,
and
a
fresh
consultation
would
*NL*
be
held
.
By
degrees
we
appeared
to
contract
our
search
within
*NL*
narrower
and
easier
limits
.
Single
police-officers
on
duty
could
now
*NL*
tell
Mr.
Bucket
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
point
to
him
where
to
go
.
*NL*
At
last
we
stopped
for
a
rather
long
conversation
between
him
and
one
*NL*
of
these
men
,
which
I
supposed
to
be
satisfactory
from
his
manner
of
*NL*
nodding
from
time
to
time
.
When
it
was
finished
he
came
to
me
looking
*NL*
very
busy
and
very
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
said
to
me
,
``
you
wo
n't
be
alarmed
whatever
*NL*
comes
off
,
I
know
.
It
's
not
necessary
for
me
to
give
you
any
further
*NL*
caution
than
to
tell
you
that
we
have
marked
this
person
down
and
*NL*
that
you
may
be
of
use
to
me
before
I
know
it
myself
.
I
do
n't
like
to
*NL*
ask
such
a
thing
,
my
dear
,
but
would
you
walk
a
little
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
got
out
directly
and
took
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
so
easy
to
keep
your
feet
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
but
take
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
looked
about
me
confusedly
and
hurriedly
as
we
crossed
the
*NL*
street
,
I
thought
I
knew
the
place
.
``
Are
we
in
Holborn
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Do
you
know
this
turning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
Chancery
Lane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
christened
so
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
turned
down
it
,
and
as
we
went
shuffling
through
the
sleet
,
I
*NL*
heard
the
clocks
strike
half-past
five
.
We
passed
on
in
silence
and
*NL*
as
quickly
as
we
could
with
such
a
foot-hold
,
when
some
one
coming
*NL*
towards
us
on
the
narrow
pavement
,
wrapped
in
a
cloak
,
stopped
and
*NL*
stood
aside
to
give
me
room
.
In
the
same
moment
I
heard
an
*NL*
exclamation
of
wonder
and
my
own
name
from
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
I
knew
his
*NL*
voice
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
unexpected
and
so
--
I
do
n't
know
what
to
call
it
,
whether
*NL*
pleasant
or
painful
--
to
come
upon
it
after
my
feverish
wandering
*NL*
journey
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
night
,
that
I
could
not
keep
back
*NL*
the
tears
from
my
eyes
.
It
was
like
hearing
his
voice
in
a
strange
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
that
you
should
be
out
at
this
hour
,
and
in
*NL*
such
weather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
from
my
guardian
of
my
having
been
called
away
on
some
*NL*
uncommon
business
and
said
so
to
dispense
with
any
explanation
.
I
*NL*
told
him
that
we
had
but
just
left
a
coach
and
were
going
--
but
then
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
look
at
my
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
''
--
he
had
caught
the
name
from
me
--
``
we
*NL*
are
a-going
at
present
into
the
next
street
.
Inspector
Bucket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
disregarding
my
remonstrances
,
had
hurriedly
taken
off
*NL*
his
cloak
and
was
putting
it
about
me
.
``
That
's
a
good
move
,
too
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
assisting
,
``
a
very
good
move
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
with
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
me
*NL*
or
to
my
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Lord
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Bucket
,
taking
the
answer
on
himself
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
you
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
said
in
a
moment
,
and
they
took
me
between
them
,
wrapped
*NL*
in
the
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
left
Richard
,
''
said
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
``
I
have
been
sitting
*NL*
with
him
since
ten
o'clock
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
he
is
ill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
believe
me
;
not
ill
,
but
not
quite
well
.
He
was
depressed
*NL*
and
faint
--
you
know
he
gets
so
worried
and
so
worn
sometimes
--
and
Ada
*NL*
sent
to
me
of
course
;
and
when
I
came
home
I
found
her
note
and
came
*NL*
straight
here
.
Well
!
Richard
revived
so
much
after
a
little
while
,
*NL*
and
Ada
was
so
happy
and
so
convinced
of
its
being
my
doing
,
though
*NL*
God
knows
I
had
little
enough
to
do
with
it
,
that
I
remained
with
him
*NL*
until
he
had
been
fast
asleep
some
hours
.
As
fast
asleep
as
she
is
*NL*
now
,
I
hope
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friendly
and
familiar
way
of
speaking
of
them
,
his
unaffected
*NL*
devotion
to
them
,
the
grateful
confidence
with
which
I
knew
he
had
*NL*
inspired
my
darling
,
and
the
comfort
he
was
to
her
;
could
I
separate
*NL*
all
this
from
his
promise
to
me
?
How
thankless
I
must
have
been
if
it
*NL*
had
not
recalled
the
words
he
said
to
me
when
he
was
so
moved
by
the
*NL*
change
in
my
appearance
:
``
I
will
accept
him
as
a
trust
,
and
it
shall
*NL*
be
a
sacred
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
turned
into
another
narrow
street
.
``
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
who
had
eyed
him
closely
as
we
came
along
,
``
our
business
*NL*
takes
us
to
a
law-stationer
's
here
,
a
certain
Mr.
Snagsby
's
.
What
,
*NL*
you
know
him
,
do
you
?
''
He
was
so
quick
that
he
saw
it
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
a
little
of
him
and
have
called
upon
him
at
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
?
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Then
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
let
*NL*
me
leave
Miss
Summerson
with
you
for
a
moment
while
I
go
and
have
*NL*
half
a
word
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
police-officer
with
whom
he
had
conferred
was
standing
*NL*
silently
behind
us
.
I
was
not
aware
of
it
until
he
struck
in
on
my
*NL*
saying
I
heard
some
one
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
miss
,
''
he
returned
.
``
It
's
Snagsby
's
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
the
girl
's
subject
to
fits
,
and
has
*NL*
'em
bad
upon
her
to-night
.
A
most
contrary
circumstance
it
is
,
for
I
*NL*
want
certain
information
out
of
that
girl
,
and
she
must
be
brought
to
*NL*
reason
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
they
would
n't
be
up
yet
if
it
was
n't
for
her
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
''
said
the
other
man
.
``
She
's
been
at
it
pretty
well
all
night
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
true
,
''
he
returned
.
``
My
light
's
burnt
out
.
Show
yours
a
*NL*
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
passed
in
a
whisper
a
door
or
two
from
the
house
in
which
I
*NL*
could
faintly
hear
crying
and
moaning
.
In
the
little
round
of
light
*NL*
produced
for
the
purpose
,
Mr.
Bucket
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
.
*NL*
The
door
was
opened
after
he
had
knocked
twice
,
and
he
went
in
,
*NL*
leaving
us
standing
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
``
if
without
obtruding
myself
on
*NL*
your
confidence
I
may
remain
near
you
,
pray
let
me
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
truly
kind
,
''
I
answered
.
``
I
need
wish
to
keep
no
secret
of
*NL*
my
own
from
you
;
if
I
keep
any
,
it
is
another
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
.
Trust
me
,
I
will
remain
near
you
only
so
long
as
*NL*
I
can
fully
respect
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
implicitly
to
you
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
know
and
deeply
feel
how
*NL*
sacredly
you
keep
your
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
time
the
little
round
of
light
shone
out
again
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
advanced
towards
us
in
it
with
his
earnest
face
.
``
Please
to
*NL*
come
in
,
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
sit
down
by
the
fire
.
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
,
from
information
I
have
received
I
understand
you
are
a
*NL*
medical
man
.
Would
you
look
to
this
girl
and
see
if
anything
can
be
*NL*
done
to
bring
her
round
.
She
has
a
letter
somewhere
that
I
*NL*
particularly
want
.
It
's
not
in
her
box
,
and
I
think
it
must
be
about
*NL*
her
;
but
she
is
so
twisted
and
clenched
up
that
she
is
difficult
to
*NL*
handle
without
hurting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
three
went
into
the
house
together
;
although
it
was
cold
and
*NL*
raw
,
it
smelt
close
too
from
being
up
all
night
.
In
the
passage
*NL*
behind
the
door
stood
a
scared
,
sorrowful-looking
little
man
in
a
*NL*
grey
coat
who
seemed
to
have
a
naturally
polite
manner
and
spoke
*NL*
meekly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Downstairs
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Bucket
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
lady
will
*NL*
excuse
the
front
kitchen
;
we
use
it
as
our
workaday
sitting-room
.
The
*NL*
back
is
Guster
's
bedroom
,
and
in
it
she
's
a-carrying
on
,
poor
thing
,
*NL*
to
a
frightful
extent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
downstairs
,
followed
by
Mr.
Snagsby
,
as
I
soon
found
the
*NL*
little
man
to
be
.
In
the
front
kitchen
,
sitting
by
the
fire
,
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
,
with
very
red
eyes
and
a
very
severe
expression
of
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
woman
,
''
said
Mr.
Snagsby
,
entering
behind
us
,
``
to
*NL*
wave

not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
,
my
dear

hostilities
for
*NL*
one
single
moment
in
the
course
of
this
prolonged
night
,
here
is
*NL*
Inspector
Bucket
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
and
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
very
much
astonished
,
as
she
had
reason
for
doing
,
and
*NL*
looked
particularly
hard
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
woman
,
''
said
Mr.
Snagsby
,
sitting
down
in
the
remotest
*NL*
corner
by
the
door
,
as
if
he
were
taking
a
liberty
,
``
it
is
not
*NL*
unlikely
that
you
may
inquire
of
me
why
Inspector
Bucket

Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt

and
a
lady
call
upon
us
in
Cook
's
Court
,
Cursitor
Street
,
*NL*
at
the
present
hour
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
have
not
the
least
idea

If
I
*NL*
was
to
be
informed
,
I
should
despair
of
understanding
,
and
I
'd
rather
*NL*
not
be
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
so
miserable
,
sitting
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
I
*NL*
appeared
so
unwelcome
,
that
I
was
going
to
offer
an
apology
when
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
took
the
matter
on
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
*NL*
along
with
Mr.
Woodcourt
to
look
after
your
Guster

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Guster
,
Mr.
Bucket

cried
Mr.
Snagsby
.
``
Go
on
,
sir
,
go
on

I
*NL*
shall
be
charged
with
that
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
hold
the
candle
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Bucket
without
correcting
*NL*
himself
,
``
or
hold
her
,
or
make
yourself
useful
in
any
way
you
're
*NL*
asked
.
Which
there
's
not
a
man
alive
more
ready
to
do
,
for
you
're
a
*NL*
man
of
urbanity
and
suavity
,
you
know
,
and
you
've
got
the
sort
of
*NL*
heart
that
can
feel
for
another

Mr.
Woodcourt
,
would
you
be
so
good
*NL*
as
see
to
her
,
and
if
you
can
get
that
letter
from
her
,
to
let
me
*NL*
have
it
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
out
,
Mr.
Bucket
made
me
sit
down
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
*NL*
and
take
off
my
wet
shoes
,
which
he
turned
up
to
dry
upon
the
fender
,
*NL*
talking
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
be
at
all
put
out
,
miss

by
the
want
of
a
hospitable
look
*NL*
from
Mrs.
Snagsby
there
,
because
she
's
under
a
mistake
altogether
.
*NL*
She
'll
find
that
out
sooner
than
will
be
agreeable
to
a
lady
of
her
*NL*
generally
correct
manner
of
forming
her
thoughts
,
because
I
'm
a-going
*NL*
to
explain
it
to
her
.
''
Here
,
standing
on
the
hearth
with
his
wet
hat
*NL*
and
shawls
in
his
hand
,
himself
a
pile
of
wet
,
he
turned
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Snagsby
.
``
Now

you
're
well
acquainted

it
's
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
looked
rather
alarmed
,
relented
a
little
and
faltered
,
*NL*
what
did
Mr.
Bucket
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Mr.
Bucket
mean
?
''
he
repeated
,
and
I
saw
by
his
face
that
*NL*
all
the
time
he
talked
he
was
listening
for
the
discovery
of
the
*NL*
letter
,
to
my
own
great
agitation
,
for
I
knew
then
how
important
it
*NL*
must
be
;
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
means
,
ma'am
.
Go
and
see
Othello
*NL*
acted
.
That
's
the
tragedy
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
consciously
asked
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
Because
you
'll
come
to
that
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
look
out
.
Why
,
at
the
very
moment
while
I
speak
,
I
know
what
your
*NL*
mind
's
not
wholly
free
from
respecting
this
young
lady
.
But
shall
I
*NL*
tell
you
who
this
young
lady
is
?
Now
,
come
,
you
're
what
I
call
an
*NL*
intellectual
woman
--
with
your
soul
too
large
for
your
body
,
if
you
*NL*
come
to
that
,
and
chafing
it
--
and
you
know
me
,
and
you
recollect
*NL*
where
you
saw
me
last
,
and
what
was
talked
of
in
that
circle
.
Do
n't
*NL*
you
?
Yes
!
Very
well
.
This
young
lady
is
that
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
appeared
to
understand
the
reference
better
than
I
did
*NL*
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Toughey
--
him
as
you
call
Jo
--
was
mixed
up
in
the
same
business
,
*NL*
and
no
other
;
and
the
law-writer
that
you
know
of
was
mixed
up
in
the
*NL*
same
business
,
and
no
other
;
and
your
husband
,
with
no
more
knowledge
*NL*
of
it
than
your
great

was
mixed
up

Mr.

deceased

his
best
customer

the
whole

mixed
up

And
yet
a

possessing

shuts
*NL*
her

goes

runs
her
delicate-formed
*NL*
head
against

Why
,
I
am
ashamed
of
you
!
-LRB-
I
expected
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
might
have
got
it
by
this
time
.
-RRB-
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
shook
her
head
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
excitedly
.
``
No
.
See
what
happens
.
*NL*
Another
person
mixed
up
in
that
business
and
no
other
,
a
person
in
a
*NL*
wretched
state
,
comes
here
to-night
and
is
seen
a-speaking
to
your
*NL*
maid-servant
;
and
between
her
and
your
maid-servant
there
passes
*NL*
a
paper
that
I
would
give
a
hundred
pound
for
,
down
.
What
do
*NL*
you
do
?
You
hide
and
you
watch
'em
,
and
you
pounce
upon
that
*NL*
maid-servant
--
knowing
what
she
's
subject
to
and
what
a
little
thing
*NL*
will
bring
'em
on
--
in
that
surprising
manner
and
with
that
severity
*NL*
that
,
by
the
Lord
,
she
goes
off
and
keeps
off
,
when
a
life
may
be
*NL*
hanging
upon
that
girl
's
words
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
so
thoroughly
meant
what
he
said
now
that
I
involuntarily
clasped
*NL*
my
hands
and
felt
the
room
turning
away
from
me
.
But
it
stopped
.
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
came
in
,
put
a
paper
into
his
hand
,
and
went
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mrs.
Snagsby
,
the
only
amends
you
can
make
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
*NL*
rapidly
glancing
at
it
,
``
is
to
let
me
speak
a
word
to
this
young
lady
*NL*
in
private
here
.
And
if
you
know
of
any
help
that
you
can
give
to
*NL*
that
gentleman
in
the
next
kitchen
there
or
can
think
of
any
one
*NL*
thing
that
's
likelier
than
another
to
bring
the
girl
round
,
do
your
*NL*
swiftest
and
best
!
''
In
an
instant
she
was
gone
,
and
he
had
shut
the
*NL*
door
.
``
Now
my
dear
,
you
're
steady
and
quite
sure
of
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
writing
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
mother
's
.
A
pencil-writing
,
on
a
crushed
and
torn
piece
of
*NL*
paper
,
blotted
with
wet
.
Folded
roughly
like
a
letter
,
and
directed
*NL*
to
me
at
my
guardian
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
hand
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
if
you
are
firm
enough
to
read
it
*NL*
to
me
,
do
!
But
be
particular
to
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
written
in
portions
,
at
different
times
.
I
read
what
*NL*
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
to
the
cottage
with
two
objects
.
First
,
to
see
the
*NL*
dear
one
,
if
I
could
,
once
more
--
but
only
to
see
her
--
not
*NL*
to
speak
to
her
or
let
her
know
that
I
was
near
.
The
other
*NL*
object
,
to
elude
pursuit
and
to
be
lost
.
Do
not
blame
the
*NL*
mother
for
her
share
.
The
assistance
that
she
rendered
me
,
*NL*
she
rendered
on
my
strongest
assurance
that
it
was
for
the
*NL*
dear
one
's
good
.
You
remember
her
dead
child
.
The
men
's
*NL*
consent
I
bought
,
but
her
help
was
freely
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
came
.
'
That
was
written
,
''
said
my
companion
,
``
when
she
rested
*NL*
there
.
It
bears
out
what
I
made
of
it
.
I
was
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
was
written
at
another
time
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
wandered
a
long
distance
,
and
for
many
hours
,
and
*NL*
I
know
that
I
must
soon
die
.
These
streets
!
I
have
no
*NL*
purpose
but
to
die
.
When
I
left
,
I
had
a
worse
,
but
I
am
*NL*
saved
from
adding
that
guilt
to
the
rest
.
Cold
,
wet
,
and
*NL*
fatigue
are
sufficient
causes
for
my
being
found
dead
,
but
*NL*
I
shall
die
of
others
,
though
I
suffer
from
these
.
It
was
*NL*
right
that
all
that
had
sustained
me
should
give
way
at
*NL*
once
and
that
I
should
die
of
terror
and
my
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
courage
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
.
``
There
's
only
a
few
words
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
,
too
,
were
written
at
another
time
.
To
all
appearance
,
almost
*NL*
in
the
dark
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
done
all
I
could
do
to
be
lost
.
I
shall
be
soon
*NL*
forgotten
so
,
and
shall
disgrace
him
least
.
I
have
nothing
*NL*
about
me
by
which
I
can
be
recognized
.
This
paper
I
part
*NL*
with
now
.
The
place
where
I
shall
lie
down
,
if
I
can
get
*NL*
so
far
,
has
been
often
in
my
mind
.
Farewell
.
Forgive
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
,
supporting
me
with
his
arm
,
lowered
me
gently
into
my
*NL*
chair
.
``
Cheer
up
!
Do
n't
think
me
hard
with
you
,
my
dear
,
but
as
soon
*NL*
as
ever
you
feel
equal
to
it
,
get
your
shoes
on
and
be
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
as
he
required
,
but
I
was
left
there
a
long
time
,
praying
for
*NL*
my
unhappy
mother
.
They
were
all
occupied
with
the
poor
girl
,
and
I
*NL*
heard
Mr.
Woodcourt
directing
them
and
speaking
to
her
often
.
At
*NL*
length
he
came
in
with
Mr.
Bucket
and
said
that
as
it
was
important
*NL*
to
address
her
gently
,
he
thought
it
best
that
I
should
ask
her
for
*NL*
whatever
information
we
desired
to
obtain
.
There
was
no
doubt
that
*NL*
she
could
now
reply
to
questions
if
she
were
soothed
and
not
alarmed
.
*NL*
The
questions
,
Mr.
Bucket
said
,
were
how
she
came
by
the
letter
,
what
*NL*
passed
between
her
and
the
person
who
gave
her
the
letter
,
and
where
*NL*
the
person
went
.
Holding
my
mind
as
steadily
as
I
could
to
these
*NL*
points
,
I
went
into
the
next
room
with
them
.
Mr.
Woodcourt
would
have
*NL*
remained
outside
,
but
at
my
solicitation
went
in
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
girl
was
sitting
on
the
floor
where
they
had
laid
her
down
.
*NL*
They
stood
around
her
,
though
at
a
little
distance
,
that
she
might
*NL*
have
air
.
She
was
not
pretty
and
looked
weak
and
poor
,
but
she
had
a
*NL*
plaintive
and
a
good
face
,
though
it
was
still
a
little
wild
.
I
*NL*
kneeled
on
the
ground
beside
her
and
put
her
poor
head
upon
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
whereupon
she
drew
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
burst
into
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
girl
,
''
said
I
,
laying
my
face
against
her
forehead
,
for
*NL*
indeed
I
was
crying
too
,
and
trembling
,
``
it
seems
cruel
to
trouble
*NL*
you
now
,
but
more
depends
on
our
knowing
something
about
this
letter
*NL*
than
I
could
tell
you
in
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
piteously
declaring
that
she
did
n't
mean
any
harm
,
she
*NL*
did
n't
mean
any
harm
,
Mrs.
Snagsby
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
sure
of
that
,
''
said
I.
``
But
pray
tell
me
how
you
got
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
lady
,
I
will
,
and
tell
you
true
.
I
'll
tell
true
,
indeed
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
of
that
,
''
said
I.
``
And
how
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
been
out
on
an
errand
,
dear
lady
--
long
after
it
was
*NL*
dark
--
quite
late
;
and
when
I
came
home
,
I
found
a
common-looking
*NL*
person
,
all
wet
and
muddy
,
looking
up
at
our
house
.
When
she
saw
me
*NL*
coming
in
at
the
door
,
she
called
me
back
and
said
did
I
live
here
.
*NL*
And
I
said
yes
,
and
she
said
she
knew
only
one
or
two
places
about
*NL*
here
,
but
had
lost
her
way
and
could
n't
find
them
.
Oh
,
what
shall
I
*NL*
do
,
what
shall
I
do
!
They
wo
n't
believe
me
!
She
did
n't
say
any
harm
*NL*
to
me
,
and
I
did
n't
say
any
harm
to
her
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Snagsby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
for
her
mistress
to
comfort
her
--
which
she
did
,
I
*NL*
must
say
,
with
a
good
deal
of
contrition
--
before
she
could
be
got
*NL*
beyond
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
not
find
those
places
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
cried
the
girl
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
No
!
Could
n't
find
them
.
And
*NL*
she
was
so
faint
,
and
lame
,
and
miserable
,
Oh
so
wretched
,
that
if
*NL*
you
had
seen
her
,
Mr.
Snagsby
,
you
'd
have
given
her
half
a
crown
,
I
*NL*
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Guster
,
my
girl
,
''
said
he
,
at
first
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
she
was
so
well
spoken
,
''
said
the
girl
,
looking
at
me
with
*NL*
wide
open
eyes
,
``
that
it
made
a
person
's
heart
bleed

And
so
she
said
*NL*
to
me
,
did
I
know
the
way
to
the
burying
ground
?
And
I
asked
her
*NL*
which
burying
ground
.
And
she
said
,
the
poor
burying
ground
.
And
so
I
*NL*
told
her
I
had
been
a
poor
child
myself
,
and
it
was
according
to
*NL*
parishes
.
But
she
said
she
meant
a
poor
burying
ground
not
very
far
*NL*
from
here
,
where
there
was
an
archway
,
and
a
step
,
and
an
iron
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
watched
her
face
and
soothed
her
to
go
on
,
I
saw
that
Mr.
Bucket
*NL*
received
this
with
a
look
which
I
could
not
separate
from
one
of
*NL*
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
!
''
cried
the
girl
,
pressing
her
hair
back
with
her
*NL*
hands
.
``
What
shall
I
do
,
what
shall
I
do
!
She
meant
the
burying
*NL*
ground
where
the
man
was
buried
that
took
the
sleeping-stuff
--
that
*NL*
you
came
home
and
told
us
of
,
Mr.
Snagsby
--
that
frightened
me
so
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Snagsby
.
Oh
,
I
am
frightened
again
.
Hold
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
so
much
better
now
,
''
sald
I.
``
Pray
,
pray
tell
me
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
will
,
yes
I
will
!
But
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
that
's
a
dear
*NL*
lady
,
because
I
have
been
so
ill

*NL*
*NL*
Angry
with
her
,
poor
soul
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
Now
I
will
,
now
I
will

So
she
said
,
could
I
tell
her
how
to
*NL*
find
it
,
and
I
said
yes
,
and
I
told
her
;
and
she
looked
at
me
with
*NL*
eyes
like
almost
as
if
she
was
blind
,
and
herself
all
waving
back
.
*NL*
And
so
she
took
out
the
letter
,
and
showed
it
me
,
and
said
if
she
was
*NL*
to
put
that
in
the
post-office
,
it
would
be
rubbed
out
and
not
minded
*NL*
and
never
sent
;
and
would
I
take
it
from
her
,
and
send
it
,
and
the
*NL*
messenger
would
be
paid
at
the
house
.
And
so
I
said
yes
,
if
it
was
no
*NL*
harm
,
and
she
said
no
--
no
harm
.
And
so
I
took
it
from
her
,
and
she
*NL*
said
she
had
nothing
to
give
me
,
and
I
said
I
was
poor
myself
and
*NL*
consequently
wanted
nothing
.
And
so
she
said
God
bless
you
,
and
*NL*
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
she
go
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
cried
the
girl
,
anticipating
the
inquiry
.
``
Yes
!
She
went
the
*NL*
way
I
had
shown
her
.
Then
I
came
in
,
and
Mrs.
Snagsby
came
behind
me
*NL*
from
somewhere
and
laid
hold
of
me
,
and
I
was
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
took
her
kindly
from
me
.
Mr.
Bucket
wrapped
me
up
,
and
*NL*
immediately
we
were
in
the
street
.
Mr.
Woodcourt
hesitated
,
but
I
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
n't
leave
me
now
!
''
and
Mr.
Bucket
added
,
``
You
'll
be
better
*NL*
with
us
,
we
may
want
you
;
do
n't
lose
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
the
most
confused
impressions
of
that
walk
.
I
recollect
that
*NL*
it
was
neither
night
nor
day
,
that
morning
was
dawning
but
the
*NL*
street-lamps
were
not
yet
put
out
,
that
the
sleet
was
still
falling
*NL*
and
that
all
the
ways
were
deep
with
it
.
I
recollect
a
few
chilled
*NL*
people
passing
in
the
streets
.
I
recollect
the
wet
house-tops
,
the
*NL*
clogged
and
bursting
gutters
and
water-spouts
,
the
mounds
of
*NL*
blackened
ice
and
snow
over
which
we
passed
,
the
narrowness
of
the
*NL*
courts
by
which
we
went
.
At
the
same
time
I
remember
that
the
poor
*NL*
girl
seemed
to
be
yet
telling
her
story
audibly
and
plainly
in
my
*NL*
hearing
,
that
I
could
feel
her
resting
on
my
arm
,
that
the
stained
*NL*
house-fronts
put
on
human
shapes
and
looked
at
me
,
that
great
*NL*
water-gates
seemed
to
be
opening
and
closing
in
my
head
or
in
the
*NL*
air
,
and
that
the
unreal
things
were
more
substantial
than
the
real
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
stood
under
a
dark
and
miserable
covered
way
,
where
one
*NL*
lamp
was
burning
over
an
iron
gate
and
where
the
morning
faintly
*NL*
struggled
in
.
The
gate
was
closed
.
Beyond
it
was
a
burial
ground
--
a
*NL*
dreadful
spot
in
which
the
night
was
very
slowly
stirring
,
but
where
*NL*
I
could
dimly
see
heaps
of
dishonoured
graves
and
stones
,
hemmed
in
*NL*
by
filthy
houses
with
a
few
dull
lights
in
their
windows
and
on
whose
*NL*
walls
a
thick
humidity
broke
out
like
a
disease
.
On
the
step
at
the
*NL*
gate
,
drenched
in
the
fearful
wet
of
such
a
place
,
which
oozed
and
*NL*
splashed
down
everywhere
,
I
saw
,
with
a
cry
of
pity
and
horror
,
a
*NL*
woman
lying
--
Jenny
,
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
forward
,
but
they
stopped
me
,
and
Mr.
Woodcourt
entreated
me
*NL*
with
the
greatest
earnestness
,
even
with
tears
,
before
I
went
up
to
*NL*
the
figure
to
listen
for
an
instant
to
what
Mr.
Bucket
said
.
I
did
*NL*
so
,
as
I
thought
.
I
did
so
,
as
I
am
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
you
'll
understand
me
,
if
you
think
a
moment
.
They
*NL*
changed
clothes
at
the
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
changed
clothes
at
the
cottage
.
I
could
repeat
the
words
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
and
I
knew
what
they
meant
of
themselves
,
but
I
attached
no
*NL*
meaning
to
them
in
any
other
connexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
one
returned
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
and
one
went
on
.
And
the
one
*NL*
that
went
on
only
went
on
a
certain
way
agreed
upon
to
deceive
and
*NL*
then
turned
across
country
and
went
home
.
Think
a
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
repeat
this
in
my
mind
too
,
but
I
had
not
the
least
idea
what
*NL*
it
meant
.
I
saw
before
me
,
lying
on
the
step
,
the
mother
of
the
dead
*NL*
child
.
She
lay
there
with
one
arm
creeping
round
a
bar
of
the
iron
*NL*
gate
and
seeming
to
embrace
it
.
She
lay
there
,
who
had
so
lately
*NL*
spoken
to
my
mother
.
She
lay
there
,
a
distressed
,
unsheltered
,
*NL*
senseless
creature
.
She
who
had
brought
my
mother
's
letter
,
who
could
*NL*
give
me
the
only
clue
to
where
my
mother
was
;
she
,
who
was
to
guide
*NL*
us
to
rescue
and
save
her
whom
we
had
sought
so
far
,
who
had
come
to
*NL*
this
condition
by
some
means
connected
with
my
mother
that
I
could
*NL*
not
follow
,
and
might
be
passing
beyond
our
reach
and
help
at
that
*NL*
moment
;
she
lay
there
,
and
they
stopped
me
!
I
saw
but
did
not
*NL*
comprehend
the
solemn
and
compassionate
look
in
Mr.
Woodcourt
's
face
.
*NL*
I
saw
but
did
not
comprehend
his
touching
the
other
on
the
breast
to
*NL*
keep
him
back
.
I
saw
him
stand
uncovered
in
the
bitter
air
,
with
a
*NL*
reverence
for
something
.
But
my
understanding
for
all
this
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
even
heard
it
said
between
them
,
``
Shall
she
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
better
go
.
Her
hands
should
be
the
first
to
touch
her
.
They
*NL*
have
a
higher
right
than
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
on
to
the
gate
and
stooped
down
.
I
lifted
the
heavy
head
,
*NL*
put
the
long
dank
hair
aside
,
and
turned
the
face
.
And
it
was
my
*NL*
mother
,
cold
and
dead
.

CHAPTER
LX
*NL*
*NL*
Perspective
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
proceed
to
other
passages
of
my
narrative
.
From
the
goodness
of
all
*NL*
about
me
I
derived
such
consolation
as
I
can
never
think
of
unmoved
.
*NL*
I
have
already
said
so
much
of
myself
,
and
so
much
still
remains
,
*NL*
that
I
will
not
dwell
upon
my
sorrow
.
I
had
an
illness
,
but
it
was
*NL*
not
a
long
one
;
and
I
would
avoid
even
this
mention
of
it
if
I
could
*NL*
quite
keep
down
the
recollection
of
their
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
proceed
to
other
passages
of
my
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
time
of
my
illness
,
we
were
still
in
London
,
where
Mrs.
*NL*
Woodcourt
had
come
,
on
my
guardian
's
invitation
,
to
stay
with
us
.
*NL*
When
my
guardian
thought
me
well
and
cheerful
enough
to
talk
with
him
*NL*
in
our
old
way
--
though
I
could
have
done
that
sooner
if
he
would
have
*NL*
believed
me
--
I
resumed
my
work
and
my
chair
beside
his
.
He
had
*NL*
appointed
the
time
himself
,
and
we
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dame
Trot
,
''
said
he
,
receiving
me
with
a
kiss
,
``
welcome
to
the
*NL*
growlery
again
,
my
dear
.
I
have
a
scheme
to
develop
,
little
woman
.
I
*NL*
propose
to
remain
here
,
perhaps
for
six
months
,
perhaps
for
a
longer
*NL*
time
--
as
it
may
be
.
Quite
to
settle
here
for
a
while
,
in
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
the
meanwhile
leave
Bleak
House
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
my
dear
?
Bleak
House
,
''
he
returned
,
``
must
learn
to
take
care
of
*NL*
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
his
tone
sounded
sorrowful
,
but
looking
at
him
,
I
saw
his
*NL*
kind
face
lighted
up
by
its
pleasantest
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bleak
House
,
''
he
repeated
--
and
his
tone
did
NOT
sound
sorrowful
,
I
*NL*
found
--
``
must
learn
to
take
care
of
itself
.
It
is
a
long
way
from
Ada
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
and
Ada
stands
much
in
need
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
you
,
guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
have
been
taking
that
into
*NL*
consideration
for
a
happy
surprise
to
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
disinterested
either
,
my
dear
,
if
you
mean
to
extol
me
for
*NL*
that
virtue
,
since
if
you
were
generally
on
the
road
,
you
could
be
*NL*
seldom
with
me
.
And
besides
,
I
wish
to
hear
as
much
and
as
often
of
*NL*
Ada
as
I
can
in
this
condition
of
estrangement
from
poor
Rick
.
Not
of
*NL*
her
alone
,
but
of
him
too
,
poor
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
this
morning
,
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
Mr.
Woodcourt
every
morning
,
Dame
Durden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
still
say
the
same
of
Richard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
same
.
He
knows
of
no
direct
bodily
illness
that
he
has
;
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
he
believes
that
he
has
none
.
Yet
he
is
not
easy
about
*NL*
him
;
who
CAN
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
girl
had
been
to
see
us
lately
every
day
,
some
times
twice
in
*NL*
a
day
.
But
we
had
foreseen
,
all
along
,
that
this
would
only
last
*NL*
until
I
was
quite
myself
.
We
knew
full
well
that
her
fervent
heart
*NL*
was
as
full
of
affection
and
gratitude
towards
her
cousin
John
as
it
*NL*
had
ever
been
,
and
we
acquitted
Richard
of
laying
any
injunctions
*NL*
upon
her
to
stay
away
;
but
we
knew
on
the
other
hand
that
she
felt
it
*NL*
a
part
of
her
duty
to
him
to
be
sparing
of
her
visits
at
our
house
.
*NL*
My
guardian
's
delicacy
had
soon
perceived
this
and
had
tried
to
*NL*
convey
to
her
that
he
thought
she
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
unfortunate
,
mistaken
Richard
,
''
said
I.
``
When
will
he
awake
*NL*
from
his
delusion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
in
the
way
to
do
so
now
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
my
guardian
.
*NL*
``
The
more
he
suffers
,
the
more
averse
he
will
be
to
me
,
having
made
*NL*
me
the
principal
representative
of
the
great
occasion
of
his
*NL*
suffering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
adding
,
``
So
unreasonably
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Dame
Trot
,
Dame
Trot
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
``
what
shall
we
find
*NL*
reasonable
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
!
Unreason
and
injustice
at
the
*NL*
top
,
unreason
and
injustice
at
the
heart
and
at
the
bottom
,
unreason
*NL*
and
injustice
from
beginning
to
end
--
if
it
ever
has
an
end
--
how
*NL*
should
poor
Rick
,
always
hovering
near
it
,
pluck
reason
out
of
it
?
He
*NL*
no
more
gathers
grapes
from
thorns
or
figs
from
thistles
than
older
*NL*
men
did
in
old
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
gentleness
and
consideration
for
Richard
whenever
we
spoke
of
him
*NL*
touched
me
so
that
I
was
always
silent
on
this
subject
very
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
and
the
Vice
Chancellors
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
Chancery
battery
of
great
guns
would
be
infinitely
astonished
*NL*
by
such
unreason
and
injustice
in
one
of
their
suitors
,
''
pursued
my
*NL*
guardian
.
``
When
those
learned
gentlemen
begin
to
raise
moss-roses
*NL*
from
the
powder
they
sow
in
their
wigs
,
I
shall
begin
to
be
*NL*
astonished
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
checked
himself
in
glancing
towards
the
window
to
look
where
the
*NL*
wind
was
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
my
chair
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
little
woman
!
To
go
on
,
my
dear
.
This
rock
we
must
leave
*NL*
to
time
,
chance
,
and
hopeful
circumstance
.
We
must
not
shipwreck
Ada
*NL*
upon
it
.
She
can
not
afford
,
and
he
can
not
afford
,
the
remotest
chance
*NL*
of
another
separation
from
a
friend
.
Therefore
I
have
particularly
*NL*
begged
of
Woodcourt
,
and
I
now
particularly
beg
of
you
,
my
dear
,
not
*NL*
to
move
this
subject
with
Rick
.
Let
it
rest
.
Next
week
,
next
month
,
*NL*
next
year
,
sooner
or
later
,
he
will
see
me
with
clearer
eyes
.
I
can
*NL*
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
already
discussed
it
with
him
,
I
confessed
;
and
so
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
had
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
tells
me
,
''
returned
my
guardian
.
``
Very
good
.
He
has
made
his
*NL*
protest
,
and
Dame
Durden
has
made
hers
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
*NL*
be
said
about
it
.
Now
I
come
to
Mrs.
Woodcourt
.
How
do
you
like
her
,
*NL*
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
answer
to
this
question
,
which
was
oddly
abrupt
,
I
said
I
liked
*NL*
her
very
much
and
thought
she
was
more
agreeable
than
she
used
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
Less
pedigree
?
Not
so
much
of
*NL*
Morgan
ap
--
what
's
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
I
meant
,
I
acknowledged
,
though
he
was
a
very
harmless
*NL*
person
,
even
when
we
had
had
more
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
upon
the
whole
,
he
is
as
well
in
his
native
mountains
,
''
said
*NL*
my
guardian
.
``
I
agree
with
you
.
Then
,
little
woman
,
can
I
do
better
*NL*
for
a
time
than
retain
Mrs.
Woodcourt
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
And
yet
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
looked
at
me
,
waiting
for
what
I
had
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
nothing
to
say
.
At
least
I
had
nothing
in
my
mind
that
I
could
*NL*
say
.
I
had
an
undefined
impression
that
it
might
have
been
better
if
*NL*
we
had
had
some
other
inmate
,
but
I
could
hardly
have
explained
why
*NL*
even
to
myself
.
Or
,
if
to
myself
,
certainly
not
to
anybody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
our
neighbourhood
is
in
Woodcourt
's
*NL*
way
,
and
he
can
come
here
to
see
her
as
often
as
he
likes
,
which
is
*NL*
agreeable
to
them
both
;
and
she
is
familiar
to
us
and
fond
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
That
was
undeniable
.
I
had
nothing
to
say
against
it
.
I
could
*NL*
not
have
suggested
a
better
arrangement
,
but
I
was
not
quite
easy
in
*NL*
my
mind
.
Esther
,
Esther
,
why
not
?
Esther
,
think
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
good
plan
indeed
,
dear
guardian
,
and
we
could
not
do
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
little
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
sure
.
I
had
had
a
moment
's
time
to
think
,
since
I
had
urged
*NL*
that
duty
on
myself
,
and
I
was
quite
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
It
shall
be
done
.
Carried
unanimously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carried
unanimously
,
''
I
repeated
,
going
on
with
my
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cover
for
his
book-table
that
I
happened
to
be
ornamenting
.
*NL*
It
had
been
laid
by
on
the
night
preceding
my
sad
journey
and
never
*NL*
resumed
.
I
showed
it
to
him
now
,
and
he
admired
it
highly
.
After
I
*NL*
had
explained
the
pattern
to
him
and
all
the
great
effects
that
were
*NL*
to
come
out
by
and
by
,
I
thought
I
would
go
back
to
our
last
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
,
dear
guardian
,
when
we
spoke
of
Mr.
Woodcourt
before
Ada
*NL*
left
us
,
that
you
thought
he
would
give
a
long
trial
to
another
*NL*
country
.
Have
you
been
advising
him
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
little
woman
,
pretty
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
decided
to
do
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
think
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
other
prospect
has
opened
to
him
,
perhaps
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
yes
--
perhaps
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
beginning
his
answer
in
a
*NL*
very
deliberate
manner
.
``
About
half
a
year
hence
or
so
,
there
is
a
*NL*
medical
attendant
for
the
poor
to
be
appointed
at
a
certain
place
in
*NL*
Yorkshire
.
It
is
a
thriving
place
,
pleasantly
situated
--
streams
and
*NL*
streets
,
town
and
country
,
mill
and
moor
--
and
seems
to
present
an
*NL*
opening
for
such
a
man
.
I
mean
a
man
whose
hopes
and
aims
may
*NL*
sometimes
lie
-LRB-
as
most
men
's
sometimes
do
,
I
dare
say
-RRB-
above
the
*NL*
ordinary
level
,
but
to
whom
the
ordinary
level
will
be
high
enough
*NL*
after
all
if
it
should
prove
to
be
a
way
of
usefulness
and
good
*NL*
service
leading
to
no
other
.
All
generous
spirits
are
ambitious
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
but
the
ambition
that
calmly
trusts
itself
to
such
a
road
,
*NL*
instead
of
spasmodically
trying
to
fly
over
it
,
is
of
the
kind
I
care
*NL*
for
.
It
is
Woodcourt
's
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
he
get
this
appointment
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
little
woman
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
smiling
,
``
not
being
an
*NL*
oracle
,
I
can
not
confidently
say
,
but
I
think
so
.
His
reputation
*NL*
stands
very
high
;
there
were
people
from
that
part
of
the
country
in
*NL*
the
shipwreck
;
and
strange
to
say
,
I
believe
the
best
man
has
the
*NL*
best
chance
.
You
must
not
suppose
it
to
be
a
fine
endowment
.
It
is
a
*NL*
very
,
very
commonplace
affair
,
my
dear
,
an
appointment
to
a
great
*NL*
amount
of
work
and
a
small
amount
of
pay
;
but
better
things
will
*NL*
gather
about
it
,
it
may
be
fairly
hoped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
of
that
place
will
have
reason
to
bless
the
choice
if
it
*NL*
falls
on
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
little
woman
;
that
I
am
sure
they
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
no
more
about
it
,
nor
did
he
say
a
word
about
the
future
of
*NL*
Bleak
House
.
But
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
taken
my
seat
at
his
*NL*
side
in
my
mourning
dress
,
and
that
accounted
for
it
,
I
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
to
visit
my
dear
girl
every
day
in
the
dull
dark
corner
*NL*
where
she
lived
.
The
morning
was
my
usual
time
,
but
whenever
I
found
*NL*
I
had
an
hour
or
so
to
spare
,
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
bustled
off
to
*NL*
Chancery
Lane
.
They
were
both
so
glad
to
see
me
at
all
hours
,
and
*NL*
used
to
brighten
up
so
when
they
heard
me
opening
the
door
and
coming
*NL*
in
-LRB-
being
quite
at
home
,
I
never
knocked
-RRB-
,
that
I
had
no
fear
of
*NL*
becoming
troublesome
just
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
these
occasions
I
frequently
found
Richard
absent
.
At
other
times
*NL*
he
would
be
writing
or
reading
papers
in
the
cause
at
that
table
of
*NL*
his
,
so
covered
with
papers
,
which
was
never
disturbed
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
would
come
upon
him
lingering
at
the
door
of
Mr.
Vholes
's
office
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
would
meet
him
in
the
neighbourhood
lounging
about
and
*NL*
biting
his
nails
.
I
often
met
him
wandering
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
near
*NL*
the
place
where
I
had
first
seen
him
,
oh
how
different
,
how
*NL*
different
!
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
money
Ada
brought
him
was
melting
away
with
the
candles
I
*NL*
used
to
see
burning
after
dark
in
Mr.
Vholes
's
office
I
knew
very
*NL*
well
.
It
was
not
a
large
amount
in
the
beginning
,
he
had
married
in
*NL*
debt
,
and
I
could
not
fail
to
understand
,
by
this
time
,
what
was
*NL*
meant
by
Mr.
Vholes
's
shoulder
being
at
the
wheel
--
as
I
still
heard
*NL*
it
was
.
My
dear
made
the
best
of
housekeepers
and
tried
hard
to
save
,
*NL*
but
I
knew
that
they
were
getting
poorer
and
poorer
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shone
in
the
miserable
corner
like
a
beautiful
star
.
She
adorned
*NL*
and
graced
it
so
that
it
became
another
place
.
Paler
than
she
had
*NL*
been
at
home
,
and
a
little
quieter
than
I
had
thought
natural
when
*NL*
she
was
yet
so
cheerful
and
hopeful
,
her
face
was
so
unshadowed
that
*NL*
I
half
believed
she
was
blinded
by
her
love
for
Richard
to
his
*NL*
ruinous
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
one
day
to
dine
with
them
while
I
was
under
this
impression
.
*NL*
As
I
turned
into
Symond
's
Inn
,
I
met
little
Miss
Flite
coming
out
.
*NL*
She
had
been
to
make
a
stately
call
upon
the
wards
in
Jarndyce
,
as
*NL*
she
still
called
them
,
and
had
derived
the
highest
gratification
from
*NL*
that
ceremony
.
Ada
had
already
told
me
that
she
called
every
Monday
*NL*
at
five
o'clock
,
with
one
little
extra
white
bow
in
her
bonnet
,
which
*NL*
never
appeared
there
at
any
other
time
,
and
with
her
largest
reticule
*NL*
of
documents
on
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
she
began
.
``
So
delighted
!
How
do
you
do
!
So
glad
to
see
*NL*
you
.
And
you
are
going
to
visit
our
interesting
Jarndyce
wards
?
TO
be
*NL*
sure
!
Our
beauty
is
at
home
,
my
dear
,
and
will
be
charmed
to
see
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Richard
is
not
come
in
yet
?
''
said
I.
``
I
am
glad
of
that
,
for
I
*NL*
was
afraid
of
being
a
little
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
not
come
in
,
''
returned
Miss
Flite
.
``
He
has
had
a
long
day
*NL*
in
court
.
I
left
him
there
with
Vholes
.
You
do
n't
like
Vholes
,
I
*NL*
hope
?
DO
N'T
like
Vholes
.
Dan-gerous
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
see
Richard
oftener
than
ever
now
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
,
''
returned
Miss
Flite
,
``
daily
and
hourly
.
You
know
what
I
*NL*
told
you
of
the
attraction
on
the
Chancellor
's
table
?
My
dear
,
next
*NL*
to
myself
he
is
the
most
constant
suitor
in
court

He
begins
quite
to
*NL*
amuse
our
little
party
.
Ve-ry
friendly
little
party
,
are
we
not
?

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
miserable
to
hear
this
from
her
poor
mad
lips
,
though
it
was
*NL*
no
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
my
valued
friend
,
''
pursued
Miss
Flite
,
advancing
her
lips
*NL*
to
my
ear
with
an
air
of
equal
patronage
and
mystery
,
``
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
a
secret
.
I
have
made
him
my
executor
.
Nominated
,
constituted

*NL*
and
appointed
him
.
In
my
will

Ye-es

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es

''
repeated
Miss
Flite
in
her
most
genteel
accents
,
``
my
*NL*
executor
,
administrator
,
and
assign
.
-LRB-
Our
Chancery
phrases
,
my
love

-RRB-
*NL*
I
have
reflected
that
if
I
should
wear
out
,
he
will
be
able
to
watch
*NL*
that
judgment
.
Being
so
very
regular
in
his
attendance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
sigh
to
think
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
at
one
time
mean
,
''
said
Miss
Flite
,
echoing
the
sigh
,
``

*NL*
nominate

constitute

and
appoint

Gridley

Also
very
regular

*NL*
charming

I
assure
you

most
exemplary

But
he
wore
out

poor
*NL*
man
,
so
I
have
appointed
his
successor

Do
n't
mention
it

This
is
in

confidence

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
carefully
opened
her
reticule
a
little
way
and
showed
me
a
folded
*NL*
piece
of
paper
inside
as
the
appointment
of
which
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another

added

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

Miss
Flite

''
said
I
,
knowing
how
it
pleased
her
to
have
her
*NL*
confidence
received
with
an
appearance
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
several
times
,
and
her
face
became
overcast
and
gloomy
.
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
soul
kissed
me
with
the
most
troubled
look
I
had
ever
seen
*NL*
in
her
and
went
her
way
.
Her
manner
of
running
over
the
names
of
her
*NL*
birds
,
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
hearing
them
even
from
her
own
lips
,
*NL*
quite
chilled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
a
cheering
preparation
for
my
visit
,
and
I
could
have
*NL*
dispensed
with
the
company
of
Mr.
Vholes
,
when
Richard
-LRB-
who
arrived
*NL*
within
a
minute
or
two
after
me
-RRB-
brought
him
to
share
our
dinner
.
*NL*
Although
it
was
a
very
plain
one
,
Ada
and
Richard
were
for
some
*NL*
minutes
both
out
of
the
room
together
helping
to
get
ready
what
we
*NL*
were
to
eat
and
drink
.
Mr.
Vholes
took
that
opportunity
of
holding
a
*NL*
little
conversation
in
a
low
voice
with
me
.
He
came
to
the
window
*NL*
where
I
was
sitting
and
began
upon
Symond
's
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dull
place
,
Miss
Summerson
,
for
a
life

not

official
*NL*
one

said
Mr.
Vholes

smearing
the
glass
with
his
black
glove
to
*NL*
make
it
clearer
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
much

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor

returned
Mr.
Vholes
.
``
A
little
music

occasionally
stray
in

eject
it

*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
Mr.

said
he
was
quite
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
behind
me
with
his
long
black
figure
reaching
nearly
to
the
*NL*
ceiling
of
those
low
rooms

feeling
the
pimples
on
his
face
as
if

they
were
ornaments

speaking
inwardly

evenly

there

were
not

his
nature

resumed

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
So
slow

bloodless

gaunt

I
felt
as
if
Richard
were
*NL*
wasting
away
beneath
the
eyes
of
this

there
were
*NL*
something
of
the

in
him

Mr.

very

rubbing
his

his
cold
sense
of
touch

they
were
much
the
same
in
*NL*
black
kid
or
out
of
it
,
``
this
was
an
ill-advised
marriage
of
Mr.
*NL*
C.
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
begged
he
would
excuse
me
from
discussing
it
.
They
had
been
engaged
*NL*
when
they
were
both
very
young
,
I
told
him
-LRB-
a
little
indignantly
-RRB-
and
*NL*
when
the
prospect
before
them
was
much
fairer
and
brighter
.
When
*NL*
Richard
had
not
yielded
himself
to
the
unhappy
influence
which
now
*NL*
darkened
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
assented
Mr.
Vholes
again
.
``
Still
,
with
a
view
to
*NL*
everything
being
openly
carried
on
,
I
will
,
with
your
permission
,
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
,
observe
to
you
that
I
consider
this
a
very
*NL*
ill-advised
marriage
indeed
.
I
owe
the
opinion
not
only
to
Mr.
C.
's
*NL*
connexions
,
against
whom
I
should
naturally
wish
to
protect
myself
,
*NL*
but
also
to
my
own
reputation
--
dear
to
myself
as
a
professional
man
*NL*
aiming
to
keep
respectable
;
dear
to
my
three
girls
at
home
,
for
whom
*NL*
I
am
striving
to
realize
some
little
independence
;
dear
,
I
will
even
*NL*
say
,
to
my
aged
father
,
whom
it
is
my
privilege
to
support
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
become
a
very
different
marriage
,
a
much
happier
and
better
*NL*
marriage
,
another
marriage
altogether
,
Mr.
Vholes
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
*NL*
Richard
were
persuaded
to
turn
his
back
on
the
fatal
pursuit
in
which
*NL*
you
are

him

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
,
with
a
noiseless
cough
--
or
rather
gasp
--
into
one
of
his
*NL*
black
gloves
,
inclined
his
head
as
if
he
did
not
wholly
dispute
even
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
may
be
so
;
and
I
freely
admit
that
the
*NL*
young
lady
who
has
taken
Mr.

name
upon
herself
in
so
ill-advised
*NL*
a
manner
--
you
will
I
am
sure
not
quarrel
with
me
for
throwing
out
*NL*
that
remark
again
,
as
a
duty
I
owe
to
Mr.
C.
's
connexions
--
is
a
*NL*
highly
genteel
young
lady
.
Business
has
prevented
me
from
mixing
much
*NL*
with
general
society
in
any
but
a
professional
character
;
still
I
*NL*
trust
I
am
competent
to
perceive
that
she
is
a
highly
genteel
young
*NL*
lady
.
As
to
beauty
,
I
am
not
a
judge
of
that
myself
,
and
I
never
did
*NL*
give
much
attention
to
it
from
a
boy
,
but
I
dare
say
the
young
lady
*NL*
is
equally
eligible
in
that
point
of
view
.
She
is
considered
so
-LRB-
I
*NL*
have
heard
-RRB-
among
the
clerks
in
the
Inn
,
and
it
is
a
point
more
in
*NL*
their
way
than
in
mine
.
In
reference
to
Mr.
C.
's
pursuit
of
his
*NL*
interests
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
His
interests
,
Mr.
Vholes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
returned
Mr.
Vholes
,
going
on
in
exactly
the
same
inward
*NL*
and
dispassionate
manner
.
``
Mr.
C.
takes
certain
interests
under
*NL*
certain
wills
disputed
in
the
suit

It
is
a
term
we
use
.
In
reference
*NL*
to
Mr.
C
,
's
pursuit
of
his
interests
,
I
mentioned
to
you
,
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
the
first
time
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
in
my
*NL*
desire
that
everything
should
be
openly
carried
on
--
I
used
those
*NL*
words
,
for
I
happened
afterwards
to
note
them
in
my
diary
,
which
is
*NL*
producible
at
any
time
--
I
mentioned
to
you
that
Mr.
C.
had
laid
down
*NL*
the
principle
of
watching
his
own
interests
,
and
that
when
a
client
*NL*
of
mine
laid
down
a
principle
which
was
not
of
an
immoral
-LRB-
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
unlawful
-RRB-
nature
,
it
devolved
upon
me
to
carry
it
out
.
I
HAVE
*NL*
carried
it
out
;
I
do
carry
it
out
.
But
I
will
not
smooth
things
over
*NL*
to
any
connexion
of
Mr.
C.
's
on
any
account
.
As
open
as
I
was
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
I
am
to
you
.
I
regard
it
in
the
light
of
a
professional
*NL*
duty
to
be
so
,
though
it
can
be
charged
to
no
one
.
I
openly
say
,
*NL*
unpalatable
as
it
may
be
,
that
I
consider
Mr.
C.
's
affairs
in
a
very
*NL*
bad
way
,
that
I
consider
Mr.
C.
himself
in
a
very
bad
way
,
and
that
I
*NL*
regard
this
as
an
exceedingly
ill-advised
marriage
.
Am
I
here
,
sir
?
*NL*
Yes
,
I
thank
you
;
I
am
here
,
Mr.
C.
,
and
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
some
agreeable
conversation
with
Miss
Summerson
,
for
which
I
have
to
*NL*
thank
you
very
much
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
thus
in
answer
to
Richard
,
who
addressed
him
as
he
came
*NL*
into
the
room
.
By
this
time
I
too
well
understood
Mr.
Vholes
's
*NL*
scrupulous
way
of
saving
himself
and
his
respectability
not
to
feel
*NL*
that
our
worst
fears
did
but
keep
pace
with
his
client
's
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
down
to
dinner
,
and
I
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
Richard
,
*NL*
anxiously
.
I
was
not
disturbed
by
Mr.
Vholes
-LRB-
who
took
off
his
gloves
*NL*
to
dine
-RRB-
,
though
he
sat
opposite
to
me
at
the
small
table
,
for
I
*NL*
doubt
if
,
looking
up
at
all
,
he
once
removed
his
eyes
from
his
host
's
*NL*
face
.
I
found
Richard
thin
and
languid
,
slovenly
in
his
dress
,
*NL*
abstracted
in
his
manner
,
forcing
his
spirits
now
and
then
,
and
at
*NL*
other
intervals
relapsing
into
a
dull
thoughtfulness
.
About
his
large
*NL*
bright
eyes
that
used
to
be
so
merry
there
was
a
wanness
and
a
*NL*
restlessness
that
changed
them
altogether
.
I
can
not
use
the
*NL*
expression
that
he
looked
old
.
There
is
a
ruin
of
youth
which
is
not
*NL*
like
age
,
and
into
such
a
ruin
Richard
's
youth
and
youthful
beauty
*NL*
had
all
fallen
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ate
little
and
seemed
indifferent
what
it
was
,
showed
himself
to
*NL*
be
much
more
impatient
than
he
used
to
be
,
and
was
quick
even
with
*NL*
Ada
.
I
thought
at
first
that
his
old
light-hearted
manner
was
all
*NL*
gone
,
but
it
shone
out
of
him
sometimes
as
I
had
occasionally
known
*NL*
little
momentary
glimpses
of
my
own
old
face
to
look
out
upon
me
from
*NL*
the
glass
.
His
laugh
had
not
quite
left
him
either
,
but
it
was
like
*NL*
the
echo
of
a
joyful
sound
,
and
that
is
always
sorrowful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
was
as
glad
as
ever
,
in
his
old
affectionate
way
,
to
have
me
*NL*
there
,
and
we
talked
of
the
old
times
pleasantly
.
These
did
not
*NL*
appear
to
be
interesting
to
Mr.
Vholes
,
though
he
occasionally
made
a
*NL*
gasp
which
I
believe
was
his
smile
.
He
rose
shortly
after
dinner
and
*NL*
said
that
with
the
permission
of
the
ladies
he
would
retire
to
his
*NL*
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
devoted
to
business
,
Vholes
!
''
cried
Richard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
C.
,
''
he
returned
,
``
the
interests
of
clients
are
never
to
be
*NL*
neglected
,
sir
.
They
are
paramount
in
the
thoughts
of
a
professional
*NL*
man
like
myself
,
who
wishes
to
preserve
a
good
name
among
his
*NL*
fellow-practitioners
and
society
at
large
.
My
denying
myself
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
the
present
agreeable
conversation
may
not
be
wholly
*NL*
irrespective
of
your
own
interests
,
Mr.
C.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
expressed
himself
quite
sure
of
that
and
lighted
Mr.
Vholes
*NL*
out
.
On
his
return
he
told
us
,
more
than
once
,
that
Vholes
was
a
good
*NL*
fellow
,
a
safe
fellow
,
a
man
who
did
what
he
pretended
to
do
,
a
very
*NL*
good
fellow
indeed
!
He
was
so
defiant
about
it
that
it
struck
me
he
*NL*
had
begun
to
doubt
Mr.
Vholes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
,
tired
out
;
and
Ada
and
I
put
*NL*
things
to
rights
,
for
they
had
no
other
servant
than
the
woman
who
*NL*
attended
to
the
chambers
.
My
dear
girl
had
a
cottage
piano
there
and
*NL*
quietly
sat
down
to
sing
some
of
Richard
's
favourites
,
the
lamp
being
*NL*
first
removed
into
the
next
room
,
as
he
complained
of
its
hurting
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
between
them
,
at
my
dear
girl
's
side
,
and
felt
very
melancholy
*NL*
listening
to
her
sweet
voice
.
I
think
Richard
did
too
;
I
think
he
*NL*
darkened
the
room
for
that
reason
.
She
had
been
singing
some
time
,
*NL*
rising
between
whiles
to
bend
over
him
and
speak
to
him
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
came
in
.
Then
he
sat
down
by
Richard
and
half
playfully
,
*NL*
half
earnestly
,
quite
naturally
and
easily
,
found
out
how
he
felt
and
*NL*
where
he
had
been
all
day
.
Presently
he
proposed
to
accompany
him
in
*NL*
a
short
walk
on
one
of
the
bridges
,
as
it
was
a
moonlight
airy
night
;
*NL*
and
Richard
readily
consenting
,
they
went
out
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
my
dear
girl
still
sitting
at
the
piano
and
me
still
*NL*
sitting
beside
her
.
When
they
were
gone
out
,
I
drew
my
arm
round
her
*NL*
waist
.
She
put
her
left
hand
in
mine
-LRB-
I
was
sitting
on
that
side
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
kept
her
right
upon
the
keys
,
going
over
and
over
them
without
*NL*
striking
any
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
my
dearest
,
''
she
said
,
breaking
silence
,
``
Richard
is
never
*NL*
so
well
and
I
am
never
so
easy
about
him
as
when
he
is
with
Allan
*NL*
Woodcourt
.
We
have
to
thank
you
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
pointed
out
to
my
darling
how
this
could
scarcely
be
,
because
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
had
come
to
her
cousin
John
's
house
and
had
known
us
all
*NL*
there
,
and
because
he
had
always
liked
Richard
,
and
Richard
had
*NL*
always
liked
him
,
and
--
and
so
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
true
,
''
said
Ada
,
``
but
that
he
is
such
a
devoted
friend
to
us
we
*NL*
owe
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
best
to
let
my
dear
girl
have
her
way
and
to
say
no
more
*NL*
about
it
.
So
I
said
as
much
.
I
said
it
lightly
,
because
I
felt
her
*NL*
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esther
,
my
dearest
,
I
want
to
be
a
good
wife
,
a
very
,
very
good
wife
*NL*
indeed
.
You
shall
teach
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
teach
!
I
said
no
more
,
for
I
noticed
the
hand
that
was
fluttering
*NL*
over
the
keys
,
and
I
knew
that
it
was
not
I
who
ought
to
speak
,
that
*NL*
it
was
she
who
had
something
to
say
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
married
Richard
I
was
not
insensible
to
what
was
before
him
.
*NL*
I
had
been
perfectly
happy
for
a
long
time
with
you
,
and
I
had
never
*NL*
known
any
trouble
or
anxiety
,
so
loved
and
cared
for
,
but
I
*NL*
understood
the
danger
he
was
in
,
dear
Esther

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
my
darling

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
were
married
I
had
some
little
hope
that
I
might
be
able
to
*NL*
convince
him
of
his
mistake
,
that
he
might
come
to
regard
it
in
a
new
*NL*
way
as
my
husband
and
not
pursue
it
all
the
more
desperately
for
my
*NL*
sake
--
as
he
does
.
But
if
I
had
not
had
that
hope
,
I
would
have
*NL*
married
him
just
the
same
,
Esther

Just
the
same

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
momentary
firmness
of
the
hand
that
was
never
still
--
a
*NL*
firmness
inspired
by
the
utterance
of
these
last
words
,
and
dying
*NL*
away
with
them
--
I
saw
the
confirmation
of
her
earnest
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not

what
you
fear

No
one
can
understand
him
better
than
I
*NL*
do
.
The
greatest
wisdom
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
could
scarcely
*NL*
know
Richard
better
than
my
love
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
so
modestly
and
softly
and
her
trembling
hand
expressed
*NL*
such
agitation
as
it
moved
to
and
fro
upon
the
silent
notes
!
My
dear

*NL*
dear
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``

his

But
when
I
married

I
was
quite

determined

Esther

if
heaven
would
help
me

never
to
show
him

to
see
what

supports

*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
her
trembling
more
.
I
waited
for
what
was
yet
to
come
,
and
I
*NL*
now
thought
I
began
to
know
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
something
else
supports
me

*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
a
minute

Stopped
speaking
only
;
her
hand
was
still
in
*NL*
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
look
forward
a
little
while

When

turns
his

there
may
be

something
lying
on
my
breast
more
eloquent
than
I
have
been

with

greater
power
than
mine
to
show
him
his

stopped
now

She

CHAPTER
LXI
*NL*
*NL*
A
Discovery
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
when
I
frequented
that
miserable
corner
which
my
dear
girl
*NL*
brightened
can
never
fade
in
my
remembrance
.
I
never
see
it
,
and
I
*NL*
never
wish
to
see
it
now
;
I
have
been
there
only
once
since
,
but
in
*NL*
my
memory
there
is
a
mournful
glory
shining
on
the
place
which
will
*NL*
shine
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
day
passed
without
my
going
there
,
of
course
.
At
first
I
found
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
there
,
on
two
or
three
occasions
,
idly
playing
the
piano
*NL*
and
talking
in
his
usual
vivacious
strain
.
Now
,
besides
my
very
much
*NL*
mistrusting
the
probability
of
his
being
there
without
making
Richard
*NL*
poorer
,
I
felt
as
if
there
were
something
in
his
careless
gaiety
too
*NL*
inconsistent
with
what
I
knew
of
the
depths
of
Ada
's
life
.
I
clearly
*NL*
perceived
,
too
,
that
Ada
shared
my
feelings
.
I
therefore
resolved
,
*NL*
after
much
thinking
of
it
,
to
make
a
private
visit
to
Mr.
Skimpole
*NL*
and
try
delicately
to
explain
myself
.
My
dear
girl
was
the
great
*NL*
consideration
that
made
me
bold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
off
one
morning
,
accompanied
by
Charley
,
for
Somers
Town
.
As
I
*NL*
approached
the
house
,
I
was
strongly
inclined
to
turn
back
,
for
I
*NL*
felt
what
a
desperate
attempt
it
was
to
make
an
impression
on
Mr.
*NL*
Skimpole
and
how
extremely
likely
it
was
that
he
would
signally
*NL*
defeat
me
.
However
,
I
thought
that
being
there
,
I
would
go
through
*NL*
with
it
.
I
knocked
with
a
trembling
hand
at
Mr.
Skimpole
's
*NL*
door
--
literally
with
a
hand
,
for
the
knocker
was
gone
--
and
after
a
*NL*
long
parley
gained
admission
from
an
Irishwoman
,
who
was
in
the
area
*NL*
when
I
knocked
,
breaking
up
the
lid
of
a
water-butt
with
a
poker
to
*NL*
light
the
fire
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Skimpole
,
lying
on
the
sofa
in
his
room
,
playing
the
flute
a
*NL*
little
,
was
enchanted
to
see
me
.
Now
,
who
should
receive
me
,
he
*NL*
asked
.
Who
would
I
prefer
for
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
?
Would
I
*NL*
have
his
Comedy
daughter
,
his
Beauty
daughter
,
or
his
Sentiment
*NL*
daughter
?
Or
would
I
have
all
the
daughters
at
once
in
a
perfect
*NL*
nosegay
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
half
defeated
already
,
that
I
wished
to
speak
to
himself
*NL*
only
if
he
would
give
me
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
most
joyfully
!
Of
course
,
''
he
said
,
bringing
*NL*
his
chair
nearer
mine
and
breaking
into
his
fascinating
smile
,
``
of
*NL*
course
it
's
not
business
.
Then
it
's
pleasure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
it
certainly
was
not
business
that
I
came
upon
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
quite
a
pleasant
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
he
with
the
frankest
gaiety
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
allude
to
it
.
Why
should
you
allude
to
anything
that
is
NOT
a
*NL*
pleasant
matter
?
I
never
do
.
And
you
are
a
much
pleasanter
creature
,
*NL*
in
every
point
of
view
,
than
I
.
You
are
perfectly
pleasant
;
I
am
*NL*
imperfectly
pleasant
;
then
,
if
I
never
allude
to
an
unpleasant
*NL*
matter
,
how
much
less
should
you
!
So
that
's
disposed
of
,
and
we
will
*NL*
talk
of
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
was
embarrassed
,
I
took
courage
to
intimate
that
I
still
*NL*
wished
to
pursue
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
a
mistake
,
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
with
his
airy
laugh
,
*NL*
``
if
I
thought
Miss
Summerson
capable
of
making
one
.
But
I
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Skimpole
,
''
said
I
,
raising
my
eyes
to
his
,
``
I
have
so
often
*NL*
heard
you
say
that
you
are
unacquainted
with
the
common
affairs
of
*NL*
life
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meaning
our
three
banking-house
friends
,
L
,
S
,
and
who
's
the
junior
*NL*
partner
?
D
?
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
brightly
.
``
Not
an
idea
of
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
That
perhaps
,
''
I
went
on
,
``
you
will
excuse
my
boldness
on
that
*NL*
account
.
I
think
you
ought
most
seriously
to
know
that
Richard
is
*NL*
poorer
than
he
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
So
am
I
,
they
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
very
embarrassed
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parallel
case
,
exactly
!
''
said
Mr.
Skimpole
with
a
delighted
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
at
present
naturally
causes
Ada
much
secret
anxiety
,
and
as
I
*NL*
think
she
is
less
anxious
when
no
claims
are
made
upon
her
by
*NL*
visitors
,
and
as
Richard
has
one
uneasiness
always
heavy
on
his
mind
,
*NL*
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
--
if
you
*NL*
would
--
not
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
coming
to
the
point
with
great
difficulty
when
he
took
me
by
*NL*
both
hands
and
with
a
radiant
face
and
in
the
liveliest
way
*NL*
anticipated
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
go
there
?
Certainly
not
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
most
assuredly
*NL*
not
.
Why
SHOULD
I
go
there
?
When
I
go
anywhere
,
I
go
for
pleasure
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
go
anywhere
for
pain
,
because
I
was
made
for
pleasure
.
Pain
*NL*
comes
to
ME
when
it
wants
me
.
Now
,
I
have
had
very
little
pleasure
at
*NL*
our
dear
Richard
's
lately
,
and
your
practical
sagacity
demonstrates
*NL*
why
.
Our
young
friends
,
losing
the
youthful
poetry
which
was
once
so
*NL*
captivating
in
them
,
begin
to
think
,
`
This
is
a
man
who
wants
*NL*
pounds
.
'
So
I
am
;
I
always
want
pounds
;
not
for
myself
,
but
because
*NL*
tradespeople
always
want
them
of
me
.
Next
,
our
young
friends
begin
to
*NL*
think
,
becoming
mercenary
,
`
This
is
the
man
who
HAD
pounds
,
who
*NL*
borrowed
them
,
'
which
I
did
.
I
always
borrow
pounds
.
So
our
young
*NL*
friends
,
reduced
to
prose
-LRB-
which
is
much
to
be
regretted
-RRB-
,
degenerate
*NL*
in
their
power
of
imparting
pleasure
to
me
.
Why
should
I
go
to
see
*NL*
them
,
therefore
?
Absurd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
beaming
smile
with
which
he
regarded
me
as
he
reasoned
*NL*
thus
,
there
now
broke
forth
a
look
of
disinterested
benevolence
quite
*NL*
astonishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
he
said
,
pursuing
his
argument
in
his
tone
of
*NL*
light-hearted
conviction
,
``
if
I
do
n't
go
anywhere
for
pain
--
which
*NL*
would
be
a
perversion
of
the
intention
of
my
being
,
and
a
monstrous
*NL*
thing
to
do
--
why
should
I
go
anywhere
to
be
the
cause
of
pain
?
If
I
*NL*
went
to
see
our
young
friends
in
their
present
ill-regulated
state
of
*NL*
mind
,
I
should
give
them
pain
.
The
associations
with
me
would
be
*NL*
disagreeable
.
They
might
say
,
`
This
is
the
man
who
had
pounds
and
who
*NL*
ca
n't
pay
pounds
,
'
which
I
ca
n't
,
of
course
;
nothing
could
be
more
*NL*
out
of
the
question
!
Then
kindness
requires
that
I
should
n't
go
near
*NL*
them
--
and
I
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
finished
by
genially
kissing
my
hand
and
thanking
me
.
Nothing
but
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
's
fine
tact
,
he
said
,
would
have
found
this
out
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
much
disconcerted
,
but
I
reflected
that
if
the
main
point
were
*NL*
gained
,
it
mattered
little
how
strangely
he
perverted
everything
*NL*
leading
to
it
.
I
had
determined
to
mention
something
else
,
however
,
*NL*
and
I
thought
I
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Skimpole

''
said
I
,
``
I
must
take
the
liberty

conclude
my
visit

much
surprised

on
the
best
*NL*
authority

some
little
time
ago

whom
that
poor
*NL*
boy
left
Bleak
House
and
that
you
accepted
a
present

occasion

I
have
not
mentioned
it
to

guardian

for
I
fear
it
would
*NL*
hurt
him
unnecessarily

but
I
may
say
to
you
that

was
much
*NL*
surprised

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Really
surprised

he
returned
*NL*
inquiringly
,
raising
his
pleasant
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Greatly
surprised

*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
about
it
for
a
little
while
with
a
highly
agreeable
and
*NL*
whimsical
expression
of
face
,
then
quite
gave
it
up
and
said
in
his
*NL*
most
engaging
manner
,
``
You
know
what
a
child
I
am
.
Why
surprised

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
reluctant
to
enter
minutely
into
that
question
,
but
as
he
*NL*
begged
I
would
,
for
he
was
really
curious
to
know
,
I
gave
him
to
*NL*
understand
in
the
gentlest
words
I
could
use
that
his
conduct
seemed
*NL*
to
involve
a
disregard
of
several
moral
obligations
.
He
was
much
*NL*
amused
and
interested
when
he
heard
this
and
said
,
``
No
,
really
?
''
with
*NL*
ingenuous
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
do
n't
intend

be
responsible

I
never
could
do
it

Responsibility
is
a
thing
that
has
always
been
above
me

below

me

said
Mr.
Skimpole
.
``
I

-LRB-
always
remarkable
for
her
*NL*
practical
good
sense
and
clearness
-RRB-
puts
this
case

I
should
imagine
*NL*
it
was
chiefly
a
question
of
money

you
know

*NL*
*NL*
I
incautiously
gave
a
qualified
assent
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Then
you
see

said
Mr.
Skimpole
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
I
am
*NL*
hopeless
of
understanding
it

*NL*
*NL*
I
suggested
,
as
I
rose
to
go
,
that
it
was
not
right
to
betray
my
*NL*
guardian
's
confidence
for
a
bribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear

returned
with
a
candid
hilarity
that
was
*NL*
all
his

I
showed
that
I
was

a

I
had
not
the

arguing
the
question

Anything

impartiality

he
seemed

convince

tossed

to
bed
in
a
state
that
I
strongly
object
to
.
*NL*
Here
is
the
Skimpole
who
accepts
the
bank-note
produced
by
the
man
*NL*
who
demands
the
boy
who
is
received
into
the
house
and
put
to
bed
in
*NL*
a
state
that
I
strongly
object
to
.
Those
are
the
facts
.
Very
well
.
*NL*
Should
the
Skimpole
have
refused
the
note
?
WHY
should
the
Skimpole
*NL*
have
refused
the
note
?
Skimpole
protests
to
Bucket
,
`
What
's
this
for
?
*NL*
I
do
n't
understand
it
,
it
is
of
no
use
to
me
,
take
it
away
.
'
Bucket
*NL*
still
entreats
Skimpole
to
accept
it
.
Are
there
reasons
why
Skimpole
,
*NL*
not
being
warped
by
prejudices
,
should
accept
it
?
Yes
.
Skimpole
*NL*
perceives
them
.
What
are
they
?
Skimpole
reasons
with
himself
,
this
is
*NL*
a
tamed
lynx
,
an
active
police-officer
,
an
intelligent
man
,
a
person
*NL*
of
a
peculiarly
directed
energy
and
great
subtlety
both
of
conception
*NL*
and
execution
,
who
discovers
our
friends
and
enemies
for
us
when
they
*NL*
run
away
,
recovers
our
property
for
us
when
we
are
robbed
,
avenges
us
*NL*
comfortably
when
we
are
murdered
.
This
active
police-officer
and
*NL*
intelligent
man
has
acquired
,
in
the
exercise
of
his
art
,
a
strong
*NL*
faith
in
money
;
he
finds
it
very
useful
to
him
,
and
he
makes
it
very
*NL*
useful
to
society
.
Shall
I
shake
that
faith
in
Bucket
because
I
want
*NL*
it
myself
;
shall
I
deliberately
blunt
one
of
Bucket
's
weapons
;
shall
*NL*
I
positively
paralyse
Bucket
in
his
next
detective
operation
?
And
*NL*
again
.
If
it
is
blameable
in
Skimpole
to
take
the
note
,
it
is
*NL*
blameable
in
Bucket
to
offer
the
note
--
much
more
blameable
in
Bucket
,
*NL*
because
he
is
the
knowing
man
.
Now
,
Skimpole
wishes
to
think
well
of
*NL*
Bucket
;
Skimpole
deems
it
essential
,
in
its
little
place
,
to
the
*NL*
general
cohesion
of
things
,
that
he
SHOULD
think
well
of
Bucket
.
The
*NL*
state
expressly
asks
him
to
trust
to
Bucket
.
And
he
does
.
And
that
's
*NL*
all
he
does
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
nothing
to
offer
in
reply
to
this
exposition
and
therefore
took
*NL*
my
leave
.
Mr.
Skimpole
,
however
,
who
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
would
*NL*
not
hear
of
my
returning
home
attended
only
by
``
Little
Coavinses
,
''
*NL*
and
accompanied
me
himself
.
He
entertained
me
on
the
way
with
a
*NL*
variety
of
delightful
conversation
and
assured
me
,
at
parting
,
that
*NL*
he
should
never
forget
the
fine
tact
with
which
I
had
found
that
out
*NL*
for
him
about
our
young
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
so
happened
that
I
never
saw
Mr.
Skimpole
again
,
I
may
at
once
*NL*
finish
what
I
know
of
his
history
.
A
coolness
arose
between
him
and
*NL*
my
guardian
,
based
principally
on
the
foregoing
grounds
and
on
his
*NL*
having
heartlessly
disregarded
my
guardian
's
entreaties
-LRB-
as
we
*NL*
afterwards
learned
from
Ada
-RRB-
in
reference
to
Richard
.
His
being
*NL*
heavily
in
my
guardian
's
debt
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
*NL*
separation
.
He
died
some
five
years
afterwards
and
left
a
diary
*NL*
behind
him
,
with
letters
and
other
materials
towards
his
life
,
which
*NL*
was
published
and
which
showed
him
to
have
been
the
victim
of
a
*NL*
combination
on
the
part
of
mankind
against
an
amiable
child
.
It
was
*NL*
considered
very
pleasant
reading
,
but
I
never
read
more
of
it
myself
*NL*
than
the
sentence
on
which
I
chanced
to
light
on
opening
the
book
.
It
*NL*
was
this
:
``
Jarndyce
,
in
common
with
most
other
men
I
have
known
,
is
*NL*
the
incarnation
of
selfishness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
touching
myself
very
nearly
*NL*
indeed
,
and
for
which
I
was
quite
unprepared
when
the
circumstance
*NL*
occurred
.
Whatever
little
lingerings
may
have
now
and
then
revived
in
*NL*
my
mind
associated
with
my
poor
old
face
had
only
revived
as
*NL*
belonging
to
a
part
of
my
life
that
was
gone
--
gone
like
my
infancy
or
*NL*
my
childhood
.
I
have
suppressed
none
of
my
many
weaknesses
on
that
*NL*
subject
,
but
have
written
them
as
faithfully
as
my
memory
has
*NL*
recalled
them
.
And
I
hope
to
do
,
and
mean
to
do
,
the
same
down
to
the
*NL*
last
words
of
these
pages
,
which
I
see
now
not
so
very
far
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
were
gliding
away
,
and
my
dear
girl
,
sustained
by
the
*NL*
hopes
she
had
confided
in
me
,
was
the
same
beautiful
star
in
the
*NL*
miserable
corner
.
Richard
,
more
worn
and
haggard
,
haunted
the
court
*NL*
day
after
day
,
listlessly
sat
there
the
whole
day
long
when
he
knew
*NL*
there
was
no
remote
chance
of
the
suit
being
mentioned
,
and
became
*NL*
one
of
the
stock
sights
of
the
place
.
I
wonder
whether
any
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
remembered
him
as
he
was
when
he
first
went
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
completely
was
he
absorbed
in
his
fixed
idea
that
he
used
to
avow
*NL*
in
his
cheerful
moments
that
he
should
never
have
breathed
the
fresh
*NL*
air
now
``
but
for
Woodcourt
.
''
It
was
only
Mr.
Woodcourt
who
could
*NL*
occasionally
divert
his
attention
for
a
few
hours
at
a
time
and
rouse
*NL*
him
,
even
when
he
sunk
into
a
lethargy
of
mind
and
body
that
alarmed
*NL*
us
greatly
,
and
the
returns
of
which
became
more
frequent
as
the
*NL*
months
went
on
.
My
dear
girl
was
right
in
saying
that
he
only
pursued
*NL*
his
errors
the
more
desperately
for
her
sake
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
*NL*
his
desire
to
retrieve
what
he
had
lost
was
rendered
the
more
intense
*NL*
by
his
grief
for
his
young
wife
,
and
became
like
the
madness
of
a
*NL*
gamester
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
there
,
as
I
have
mentioned
,
at
all
hours
.
When
I
was
there
at
*NL*
night
,
I
generally
went
home
with
Charley
in
a
coach
;
sometimes
my
*NL*
guardian
would
meet
me
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
we
would
walk
home
*NL*
together
.
One
evening
he
had
arranged
to
meet
me
at
eight
o'clock
.
I
*NL*
could
not
leave
,
as
I
usually
did
,
quite
punctually
at
the
time
,
for
*NL*
I
was
working
for
my
dear
girl
and
had
a
few
stitches
more
to
do
to
*NL*
finish
what
I
was
about
;
but
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
hour
*NL*
when
I
bundled
up
my
little
work-basket
,
gave
my
darling
my
last
kiss
*NL*
for
the
night
,
and
hurried
downstairs
.
Mr.
Woodcourt
went
with
me
,
as
*NL*
it
was
dusk
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
usual
place
of
meeting
--
it
was
close
by
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Woodcourt
had
often
accompanied
me
before
--
my
guardian
was
not
there
.
*NL*
We
waited
half
an
hour
,
walking
up
and
down
,
but
there
were
no
signs
*NL*
of
him
.
We
agreed
that
he
was
either
prevented
from
coming
or
that
he
*NL*
had
come
and
gone
away
,
and
Mr.
Woodcourt
proposed
to
walk
home
with
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
walk
we
had
ever
taken
together
,
except
that
very
*NL*
short
one
to
the
usual
place
of
meeting
.
We
spoke
of
Richard
and
Ada
*NL*
the
whole
way
.
I
did
not
thank
him
in
words
for
what
he
had
done
--
my
*NL*
appreciation
of
it
had
risen
above
all
words
then
--
but
I
hoped
he
*NL*
might
not
be
without
some
understanding
of
what
I
felt
so
strongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arriving
at
home
and
going
upstairs
,
we
found
that
my
guardian
was
*NL*
out
and
that
Mrs.
Woodcourt
was
out
too
.
We
were
in
the
very
same
*NL*
room
into
which
I
had
brought
my
blushing
girl
when
her
youthful
*NL*
lover
,
now
her
so
altered
husband
,
was
the
choice
of
her
young
heart
,
*NL*
the
very
same
room
from
which
my
guardian
and
I
had
watched
them
*NL*
going
away
through
the
sunlight
in
the
fresh
bloom
of
their
hope
and
*NL*
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
standing
by
the
opened
window
looking
down
into
the
street
*NL*
when
Mr.
Woodcourt
spoke
to
me
.
I
learned
in
a
moment
that
he
loved
*NL*
me
.
I
learned
in
a
moment
that
my
scarred
face
was
all
unchanged
to
*NL*
him
.
I
learned
in
a
moment
that
what
I
had
thought
was
pity
and
*NL*
compassion
was
devoted
,
generous
,
faithful
love
.
Oh
,
too
late
to
know
*NL*
it
now
,
too
late
,
too
late
.
That
was
the
first
ungrateful
thought
I
*NL*
had
.
Too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
returned
,
''
he
told
me
,
``
when
I
came
back
,
no
richer
than
when
*NL*
I
went
away
,
and
found
you
newly
risen
from
a
sick
bed
,
yet
so
*NL*
inspired
by
sweet
consideration
for
others
and
so
free
from
a
selfish
*NL*
thought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
forbear
,
forbear
!
''
I
entreated
him
.
``
I
do
not
*NL*
deserve
your
high
praise
.
I
had
many
selfish
thoughts
at
that
time
,
*NL*
many
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
knows
,
beloved
of
my
life
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
my
praise
is
not
a
*NL*
lover
's
praise
,
but
the
truth
.
You
do
not
know
what
all
around
you
*NL*
see
in
Esther
Summerson
,
how
many
hearts
she
touches
and
awakens
,
*NL*
what
sacred
admiration
and
what
love
she
wins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
''
cried
I
,
``
it
is
a
great
thing
to
win
love
,
it
is
*NL*
a
great
thing
to
win
love
!
I
am
proud
of
it
,
and
honoured
by
it
;
and
*NL*
the
hearing
of
it
causes
me
to
shed
these
tears
of
mingled
joy
and
*NL*
sorrow
--
joy
that
I
have
won
it
,
sorrow
that
I
have
not
deserved
it
*NL*
better
;
but
I
am
not
free
to
think
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
it
with
a
stronger
heart
,
for
when
he
praised
me
thus
and
when
*NL*
I
heard
his
voice
thrill
with
his
belief
that
what
he
said
was
true
,
*NL*
I
aspired
to
be
more
worthy
of
it
.
It
was
not
too
late
for
that
.
*NL*
Although
I
closed
this
unforeseen
page
in
my
life
to-night
,
I
could
*NL*
be
worthier
of
it
all
through
my
life
.
And
it
was
a
comfort
to
me
,
*NL*
and
an
impulse
to
me
,
and
I
felt
a
dignity
rise
up
within
me
that
was
*NL*
derived
from
him
when
I
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
poorly
show
the
trust
that
I
have
in
the
dear
one
who
will
*NL*
evermore
be
as
dear
to
me
as
now
''
--
and
the
deep
earnestness
with
*NL*
which
he
said
it
at
once
strengthened
me
and
made
me
weep
--
``
if
,
after
*NL*
her
assurance
that
she
is
not
free
to
think
of
my
love
,
I
urged
it
.
*NL*
Dear
Esther
,
let
me
only
tell
you
that
the
fond
idea
of
you
which
I
*NL*
took
abroad
was
exalted
to
the
heavens
when
I
came
home
.
I
have
*NL*
always
hoped
,
in
the
first
hour
when
I
seemed
to
stand
in
any
ray
of
*NL*
good
fortune
,
to
tell
you
this
.
I
have
always
feared
that
I
should
*NL*
tell
it
you
in
vain
.
My
hopes
and
fears
are
both
fulfilled
to-night
.
*NL*
I
distress
you
.
I
have
said
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
seemed
to
pass
into
my
place
that
was
like
the
angel
he
*NL*
thought
me
,
and
I
felt
so
sorrowful
for
the
loss
he
had
sustained
!
I
*NL*
wished
to
help
him
in
his
trouble
,
as
I
had
wished
to
do
when
he
*NL*
showed
that
first
commiseration
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Mr.
Woodcourt

said
I
,
``
before
we
part
to-night

to

never
could
say
it
as
I
wish

I
never
*NL*
shall

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
think
again
of
being
more
deserving
of
his
love
and
his

affliction
before
I
could
go
on
.

I
am
deeply
sensible

your
generosity

treasure
its

remembrance

full
well
how
changed
I
am

I
*NL*
know
you
are
not
unacquainted
with
my
history

and
I
know
what
a
*NL*
noble
love
that
is
which
is
so
faithful
.
What
you
have
said
to
me
*NL*
could
have
affected
me
so
much
from
no
other
lips

there
are
none

that
could
give
it
such
a
value
to
me

It
shall
not
be
lost

It
shall
*NL*
make
me
better

*NL*
*NL*
He
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
turned
away
his
head
.
How
could
*NL*
I
ever
be
worthy
of
those
tears
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

the
unchanged
intercourse

shall
have
together

tending

in

happier
scenes

sprung
up
from
to-night

beats

*NL*
*NL*
He
took
my
hand
and
kissed
it
.
He
was
like
himself
again
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
still
more
encouraged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
induced

now

I

With

who
*NL*
know
him
so
well
can
imagine
him
to
have
rendered
me
,
I
have
*NL*
succeeded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
bless
him
for
it
,
''
said
I
,
giving
him
my
hand
;
``
and
heaven
*NL*
bless
you
in
all
you
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
it
better
for
the
wish
,
''
he
answered
;
``
it
will
make
me
*NL*
enter
on
these
new
duties
as
on
another
sacred
trust
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Richard
!
''
I
exclaimed
involuntarily
,
``
What
will
he
do
when
you
*NL*
are
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
required
to
go
yet
;
I
would
not
desert
him
,
dear
Miss
*NL*
Summerson
,
even
if
I
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
thing
I
felt
it
needful
to
touch
upon
before
he
left
me
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
I
should
not
be
worthier
of
the
love
I
could
not
take
if
I
*NL*
reserved
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
will
be
glad
to
know
from
my
lips
*NL*
before
I
say
good
night
that
in
the
future
,
which
is
clear
and
bright
*NL*
before
me
,
I
am
most
happy
,
most
fortunate
,
have
nothing
to
regret
or
*NL*
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
a
glad
hearing
to
him
,
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
my
childhood
I
have
been
,
''
said
I
,
``
the
object
of
the
untiring
*NL*
goodness
of
the
best
of
human
beings
,
to
whom
I
am
so
bound
by
every
*NL*
tie
of
attachment
,
gratitude
,
and
love
,
that
nothing
I
could
do
in
*NL*
the
compass
of
a
life
could
express
the
feelings
of
a
single
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
share
those
feelings
,
''
he
returned
.
``
You
speak
of
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
his
virtues
well
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
few
can
know
the
greatness
*NL*
of
his
character
as
I
know
it
.
All
its
highest
and
best
qualities
*NL*
have
been
revealed
to
me
in
nothing
more
brightly
than
in
the
shaping
*NL*
out
of
that
future
in
which
I
am
so
happy
.
And
if
your
highest
homage
*NL*
and
respect
had
not
been
his
already
--
which
I
know
they
are
--
they
*NL*
would
have
been
his
,
I
think
,
on
this
assurance
and
in
the
feeling
it
*NL*
would
have
awakened
in
you
towards
him
for
my
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fervently
replied
that
indeed
indeed
they
would
have
been
.
I
gave
*NL*
him
my
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
''
I
said
,
``
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
until
we
meet
to-morrow
,
the
second
as
a
farewell
to
this
*NL*
theme
between
us
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
;
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
me
,
and
I
stood
at
the
dark
window
watching
the
street
.
His
*NL*
love
,
in
all
its
constancy
and
generosity
,
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
*NL*
me
that
he
had
not
left
me
a
minute
when
my
fortitude
gave
way
again
*NL*
and
the
street
was
blotted
out
by
my
rushing
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
not
tears
of
regret
and
sorrow
.
No
.
He
had
called
me
*NL*
the
beloved
of
his
life
and
had
said
I
would
be
evermore
as
dear
to
*NL*
him
as
I
was
then
,
and
I
felt
as
if
my
heart
would
not
hold
the
*NL*
triumph
of
having
heard
those
words
.
My
first
wild
thought
had
died
*NL*
away
.
It
was
not
too
late
to
hear
them
,
for
it
was
not
too
late
to
be
*NL*
animated
by
them
to
be
good
,
true
,
grateful
,
and
contented
.
How
easy
*NL*
my
path
,
how
much
easier
than
his
!

CHAPTER
LXII
*NL*
*NL*
Another
Discovery
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
the
courage
to
see
any
one
that
night
.
I
had
not
even
the
*NL*
courage
to
see
myself
,
for
I
was
afraid
that
my
tears
might
a
little
*NL*
reproach
me
.
I
went
up
to
my
room
in
the
dark
,
and
prayed
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
and
lay
down
in
the
dark
to
sleep
.
I
had
no
need
of
any
light
*NL*
to
read
my
guardian
's
letter
by
,
for
I
knew
it
by
heart
.
I
took
it
*NL*
from
the
place
where
I
kept
it
,
and
repeated
its
contents
by
its
own
*NL*
clear
light
of
integrity
and
love
,
and
went
to
sleep
with
it
on
my
*NL*
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
called
Charley
to
come
for
a
*NL*
walk
.
We
bought
flowers
for
the
breakfast-table
,
and
came
back
and
*NL*
arranged
them
,
and
were
as
busy
as
possible
.
We
were
so
early
that
I
*NL*
had
a
good
time
still
for
Charley
's
lesson
before
breakfast
;
Charley
*NL*
-LRB-
who
was
not
in
the
least
improved
in
the
old
defective
article
of
*NL*
grammar
-RRB-
came
through
it
with
great
applause
;
and
we
were
altogether
*NL*
very
notable
.
When
my
guardian
appeared
he
said
,
``
Why
,
little
woman
,
*NL*
you
look
fresher
than
your
flowers
!
''
And
Mrs.
Woodcourt
repeated
and
*NL*
translated
a
passage
from
the
Mewlinnwillinwodd
expressive
of
my
*NL*
being
like
a
mountain
with
the
sun
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
so
pleasant
that
I
hope
it
made
me
still
more
like
the
*NL*
mountain
than
I
had
been
before
.
After
breakfast
I
waited
my
*NL*
opportunity
and
peeped
about
a
little
until
I
saw
my
guardian
in
his
*NL*
own
room
--
the
room
of
last
night
--
by
himself
.
Then
I
made
an
excuse
*NL*
to
go
in
with
my
housekeeping
keys
,
shutting
the
door
after
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Dame
Durden
?
''
said
my
guardian
;
the
post
had
brought
him
*NL*
several
letters
,
and
he
was
writing
.
``
You
want
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
have
plenty
in
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
was
such
a
Dame
Durden
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
for
making
*NL*
money
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
laid
down
his
pen
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
I
have
often
spoken
of
his
bright
face
,
but
I
thought
I
had
never
*NL*
seen
it
look
so
bright
and
good
.
There
was
a
high
happiness
upon
it
*NL*
which
made
me
think
,
``
He
has
been
doing
some
great
kindness
this
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
was
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
musing
as
he
smiled
upon
me
,
*NL*
``
such
a
Dame
Durden
for
making
money
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
yet
altered
his
old
manner
.
I
loved
it
and
him
so
much
*NL*
that
when
I
now
went
up
to
him
and
took
my
usual
chair
,
which
was
*NL*
always
put
at
his
side
--
for
sometimes
I
read
to
him
,
and
sometimes
I
*NL*
talked
to
him
,
and
sometimes
I
silently
worked
by
him
--
I
hardly
liked
*NL*
to
disturb
it
by
laying
my
hand
on
his
breast
.
But
I
found
I
did
not
*NL*
disturb
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
Have
I
been
remiss
*NL*
in
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remiss
in
anything
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
not
been
what
I
have
meant
to
be
since
--
I
brought
the
answer
*NL*
to
your
letter
,
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
everything
I
could
desire
,
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
that
,
''
I
returned
.
``
You
know
,
you
said
*NL*
to
me
,
was
this
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
.
And
I
said
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
nodding
his
head
.
He
had
put
his
arm
about
*NL*
me
as
if
there
were
something
to
protect
me
from
and
looked
in
my
*NL*
face
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
then
,
''
said
I
,
``
we
have
never
spoken
on
the
subject
except
*NL*
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
I
said
Bleak
House
was
thinning
fast
;
and
so
it
was
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
said
,
''
I
timidly
reminded
him
,
``
but
its
mistress
remained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
held
me
in
the
same
protecting
manner
and
with
the
same
*NL*
bright
goodness
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
know
how
you
have
felt
all
that
has
*NL*
happened
,
and
how
considerate
you
have
been
.
As
so
much
time
has
*NL*
passed
,
and
as
you
spoke
only
this
morning
of
my
being
so
well
again
,
*NL*
perhaps
you
expect
me
to
renew
the
subject
.
Perhaps
I
ought
to
do
so
.
*NL*
I
will
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
when
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
he
returned
gaily
,
``
what
a
sympathy
there
must
be
between
us
!
*NL*
I
have
had
nothing
else
,
poor
Rick
excepted
--
it
's
a
large
*NL*
exception
--
in
my
mind
.
When
you
came
in
,
I
was
full
of
it
.
When
shall
*NL*
we
give
Bleak
House
its
mistress
,
little
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
month
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
month
,
dear
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
on
which
I
take
the
happiest
and
best
step
of
my
life
--
the
*NL*
day
on
which
I
shall
be
a
man
more
exulting
and
more
enviable
than
*NL*
any
other
man
in
the
world
--
the
day
on
which
I
give
Bleak
House
its
*NL*
little
mistress
--
shall
be
next
month
then
,
''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
just
as
I
had
done
on
the
*NL*
day
when
I
brought
my
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
servant
came
to
the
door
to
announce
Mr.
Bucket
,
which
was
quite
*NL*
unnecessary
,
for
Mr.
Bucket
was
already
looking
in
over
the
servant
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
Mr.
Jarndyce
and
Miss
Summerson
,
''
said
he
,
rather
out
of
*NL*
breath
,
``
with
all
apologies
for
intruding
,
WILL
you
allow
me
to
order
*NL*
up
a
person
that
's
on
the
stairs
and
that
objects
to
being
left
there
*NL*
in
case
of
becoming
the
subject
of
observations
in
his
absence
?
Thank
*NL*
you
.
Be
so
good
as
chair
that
there
member
in
this
direction
,
will
*NL*
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
beckoning
over
the
banisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
singular
request
produced
an
old
man
in
a
black
skull-cap
,
*NL*
unable
to
walk
,
who
was
carried
up
by
a
couple
of
bearers
and
*NL*
deposited
in
the
room
near
the
door
.
Mr.
Bucket
immediately
got
rid
*NL*
of
the
bearers
,
mysteriously
shut
the
door
,
and
bolted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
see
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
he
then
began
,
putting
down
his
hat
and
*NL*
opening
his
subject
with
a
flourish
of
his
well-remembered
finger
,
*NL*
``
you
know
me
,
and
Miss
Summerson
knows
me
.
This
gentleman
likewise
*NL*
knows
me
,
and
his
name
is
Smallweed
.
The
discounting
line
is
his
line
*NL*
principally
,
and
he
's
what
you
may
call
a
dealer
in
bills
.
That
's
*NL*
about
what
YOU
are
,
you
know
,
ai
n't
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
stopping
a
*NL*
little
to
address
the
gentleman
in
question
,
who
was
exceedingly
*NL*
suspicious
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
about
to
dispute
this
designation
of
himself
when
he
was
*NL*
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
moral
,
you
know
!
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
improving
the
accident
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
contradict
when
there
ai
n't
no
occasion
,
and
you
wo
n't
be
*NL*
took
in
that
way
.
Now
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
I
address
myself
to
you
.
I
've
*NL*
been
negotiating
with
this
gentleman
on
behalf
of
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
and
one
way
and
another
I
've
been
in
and
out
and
*NL*
about
his
premises
a
deal
.
His
premises
are
the
premises
formerly
*NL*
occupied
by
Krook
,
marine
store
dealer
--
a
relation
of
this
*NL*
gentleman
's
that
you
saw
in
his
lifetime
if
I
do
n't
mistake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
replied
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
You
are
to
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``
that
this
gentleman
*NL*
he
come
into
Krook
's
property
,
and
a
good
deal
of
magpie
property
*NL*
there
was
.
Vast
lots
of
waste-paper
among
the
rest
.
Lord
bless
you
,
*NL*
of
no
use
to
nobody
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cunning
of
Mr.
Bucket
's
eye
and
the
masterly
manner
in
which
he
*NL*
contrived
,
without
a
look
or
a
word
against
which
his
watchful
*NL*
auditor
could
protest
,
to
let
us
know
that
he
stated
the
case
*NL*
according
to
previous
agreement
and
could
say
much
more
of
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
if
he
thought
it
advisable
,
deprived
us
of
any
merit
in
*NL*
quite
understanding
him
.
His
difficulty
was
increased
by
Mr.
*NL*
Smallweed
's
being
deaf
as
well
as
suspicious
and
watching
his
face
*NL*
with
the
closest
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among
them
odd
heaps
of
old
papers
,
this
gentleman
,
when
he
comes

into

to
rummage

you
see

said
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
which

Say
that
again

cried
Mr.
Smallweed
in
a
shrill

sharp

voice

*NL*
*NL*
``

repeated
Mr.

``
Being

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

conversationally

Mr.

went
on

stooping
over
him
with
an
air
of
cheerful
*NL*
raillery
which
Mr.
Smallweed
by
no

reciprocated
,

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Smallweed
glanced
with
a
troubled
eye
at

grudgingly
nodded
*NL*
assent

*NL*
``

That

the
drollery
of
it

said
Mr.
Bucket
with
the
same
lively
air
*NL*
of
recalling
a
joke
for
the
enjoyment
of
Mr.
Smallweed
,
who
still
had
*NL*
the
same
crest-fallen
appearance
of
not
enjoying
it
at
all
;
``
what

*NL*
you
find
it
to
be
but
a
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

snarled
*NL*
Mr.
Smallweed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
eyed
the
old
man
for
a
moment
--
he
had
slipped
and
shrunk
*NL*
down
in
his
chair
into
a
mere
bundle
--
as
if
he
were
much
disposed
to
*NL*
pounce
upon
him
;
nevertheless
,
he
continued
to
bend
over
him
with
the
*NL*
same
agreeable
air
,
keeping
the
corner
of
one
of
his
eyes
upon
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Notwithstanding
which
,
''
said
Mr.
Bucket
,
``

get
a
little
doubtful
*NL*
and
uncomfortable
in

about

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

What
do

Mr.

his
hand
to
his

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

as
you
know
what
a

*NL*
``

how

put

cried
the

anxiously
with

his

at
his
ear

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
had
certainly
picked
him
up
at
a
dart
.
However
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
could
be
heard
through
Mr.
Smallweed
's
coughing
and
his
vicious
*NL*
ejaculations
of
``
Oh

my
bones

Oh

no
breath

*NL*

worse
than

clattering

brimstone

*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
proceeded
in
the
same
convivial
manner
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
an
admission
with
more
ill
*NL*
will
and
a
worse
grace
than
Mr.
Smallweed
displayed
when
he
admitted
*NL*
this
,
rendering
it
perfectly
evident
that
Mr.
Bucket
was
the
very
*NL*
last
person
he
would
have
thought
of
taking
into
his
confidence
if
he

could
by

have
kept
him
out

*NL*
*NL*
``

precious

said
Mr.

emphatically
;
``

accordingly

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

assented

bad

*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Bucket
,
dismissing
his
agreeable
*NL*
manner
all
at
once
and
becoming
strictly
business-like
,
``
you
've
got
*NL*
that
will
upon
your
person
at
the
present
time
,
and
the
only
thing
*NL*
that
remains
for
you
to
do
is
just
to
out
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
given
us
one
glance
out
of
the
watching
corner
of
his
eye
,
and
*NL*
having
given
his
nose
one
triumphant
rub
with
his
forefinger
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
stood
with
his
eyes
fastened
on
his
confidential
friend
and
*NL*
his
hand
stretched
forth
ready
to
take
the
paper
and
present
it
to
my
*NL*
guardian
.
It
was
not
produced
without
much
reluctance
and
many
*NL*
declarations
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Smallweed
that
he
was
a
poor
*NL*
industrious
man
and
that
he
left
it
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
's
honour
not
to
*NL*
let
him
lose
by
his
honesty
.
Little
by
little
he
very
slowly
took
*NL*
from
a
breast-pocket
a
stained
,
discoloured
paper
which
was
much
*NL*
singed
upon
the
outside
and
a
little
burnt
at
the
edges
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
long
ago
been
thrown
upon
a
fire
and
hastily
snatched
off
again
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
lost
no
time
in
transferring
this
paper
,
with
the
dexterity
of
*NL*
a
conjuror
,
from
Mr.
Smallweed
to
Mr.
Jarndyce
.
As
he
gave
it
to
my
*NL*
guardian
,
he
whispered
behind
his
fingers
,
``
Had
n't
settled
how
to
*NL*
make
their
market
of
it
.
Quarrelled
and
hinted
about
it
.
I
laid
out
*NL*
twenty
pound
upon
it
.
First
the
avaricious
grandchildren
split
upon
*NL*
him
on
account
of
their
objections
to
his
living
so
unreasonably
*NL*
long
,
and
then
they
split
on
one
another
.
Lord
!
There
ai
n't
one
of
*NL*
the
family
that
would
n't
sell
the
other
for
a
pound
or
two
,
except
*NL*
the
old
lady
--
and
she
's
only
out
of
it
because
she
's
too
weak
in
her
*NL*
mind
to
drive
a
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Bucket
,
''
said
my
guardian
aloud
,
``
whatever
the
worth
of
this
*NL*
paper
may
be
to
any
one
,
my
obligations
are
great
to
you

and
if
it
*NL*
be
of
any
worth

I
hold
myself
bound
to
see
Mr.

remunerated
*NL*
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
according
to
your
merits

know

''
said
Mr.
Bucket
in
friendly
*NL*
explanation
to
Mr.
Smallweed
.
``
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
of
that

According
*NL*

its
value

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
mean

said
my
guardian
.
``
You
may
observe
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bucket
,
that
I
abstain
from
examining
this

The
plain
*NL*
truth
is
,
I
have
forsworn
and
abjured
the
whole
business
these
many
*NL*
years
,
and
my
soul
is
sick
of
it
.
But
Miss
Summerson
and
I
will
*NL*
immediately
place
the
paper
in
the
hands
of
my
solicitor
in
the
*NL*
cause
,

its
existence
shall
be
made
known
without
delay
to
all

other
parties
interested

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jarndyce
ca
n't
say
fairer
than
that

you
understand

observed
*NL*
Mr.
Bucket
to
his
fellow-visitor
.
``
And
it
being
now
made
clear
to
you
*NL*
that
nobody
's
a-going
to
be
wronged
--
which
must
be
a
great
relief
to
*NL*
YOUR
mind
--
we
may
proceed
with
the
ceremony
of
chairing
you
home
*NL*
again

*NL*
*NL*
He
unbolted
the
door
,
called
in
the
bearers
,
wished
us
good
morning
,
*NL*
and
with
a
look
full
of
meaning
and
a
crook
of
his
finger
at
parting
*NL*
went
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
our
way
too
,
which
was
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
.
Mr.
Kenge
was
disengaged
,
and
we
found
him
at
his
table
in
*NL*
his
dusty
room
with
the
inexpressive-looking
books
and
the
piles
of
*NL*
papers
.
Chairs
having
been
placed
for
us
by
Mr.
Guppy
,
Mr.
Kenge
*NL*
expressed
the
surprise
and
gratification
he
felt
at
the
unusual
sight
*NL*
of
Mr.
Jarndyce
in
his
office
.
He
turned
over
his
double
eye-glass
as
*NL*
he
spoke
and
was
more
Conversation
Kenge
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
``
that
the
genial
influence
of
Miss
*NL*
Summerson

he
bowed
to
me
,
``
may
have
induced
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
''
he
bowed
*NL*
to
him
,
``
to
forego
some
little
of
his
animosity
towards
a
cause
and
*NL*
towards
a
court

shall
I

,
which
take
their
place
in
the
*NL*
stately
vista
of
the
pillars
of
our
profession

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
inclined
to
think
,

returned
my
guardian
,
``
that
Miss
Summerson

seen

much

any

Nevertheless

they

Mr.

lay
this

tell

did
so
shortly

distinctly

*NL*
``

could
not

Mr.

my

*NL*
``

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
had
not
seemed
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
paper
,
*NL*
but
when
he
saw
it
he
appeared
more
interested

and
when
he
had
*NL*
opened
and
read
a
little
of
it
through
his
eye-glass
,
he
became
*NL*
amazed

said

looking
off

with
his
black
glove
,
spoke
to
him
at
some
length
.
*NL*
I
was
not
surprised
to
observe
Mr.
Kenge
inclined
to
dispute
what
*NL*
he
said
before
he
had
said
much
,
for
I
knew
that
no
two
people
ever
*NL*
did
agree
about
anything
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
But
he
seemed
*NL*
to
get
the
better
of
Mr.
Kenge
too
in
a
conversation
that
sounded
*NL*
as
if
it
were
almost
composed
of
the
words
``
Receiver-General
,
''
*NL*
``
Accountant-General
,
''
``
report
,
''
``
estate
,
''
and
``
costs
.
''
When
they
had
*NL*
finished
,
they
came
back
to
Mr.
Kenge
's
table
and
spoke
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
But
this
is
a
very
remarkable
document
,
Mr.
Vholes
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Kenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
said
,
``
Very
much
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
important
document
,
Mr.
Vholes
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Mr.
Vholes
said
,
``
Very
much
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
you
say
,
Mr.
Vholes
,
when
the
cause
is
in
the
paper
next
*NL*
term
,
this
document
will
be
an
unexpected
and
interesting
feature
in
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
looking
loftily
at
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vholes
was
gratified
,
as
a
smaller
practitioner
striving
to
keep
*NL*
respectable
,
to
be
confirmed
in
any
opinion
of
his
own
by
such
an
*NL*
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
,
''
asked
my
guardian
,
rising
after
a
pause
,
during
which
Mr.
*NL*
Kenge
had
rattled
his
money
and
Mr.
Vholes
had
picked
his
pimples
,
*NL*
``
when
is
next
term
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
term
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
will
be
next
month
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
we
shall
at
once
proceed
to
do
what
is
necessary
with
this
*NL*
document
and
to
collect
the
necessary
evidence
concerning
it
;
and
of
*NL*
course
you
will
receive
our
usual
notification
of
the
cause
being
in
*NL*
the
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
which
I
shall
pay
,
of
course
,
my
usual
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
bent
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
showing
us
through
the
*NL*
outer
office
to
the
door
,
``
still
bent
,
even
with
your
enlarged
mind
,
*NL*
on
echoing
a
popular
prejudice

We
are
a

Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce
,
a

prosperous
community
.
We
are
a
great

Mr.
*NL*
Jarndyce

we
are

This
is
a
great

Mr.

Jarndyce
,
and
would
you
wish
a
great
country
to
have
a
little
system
?
*NL*
Now
,
really
,
really
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
at
the
stair-head
,
gently
moving
his
right
hand
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
silver
trowel
with
which
to
spread
the
cement
of
his
words
on
*NL*
the
structure
of
the
system

consolidate
it
for
a
thousand

CHAPTER
LXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Steel
and
Iron
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
George
's
Shooting
Gallery
is
to
let
,
and
the
stock
is
sold
off
,
and
*NL*
George
himself
is
at
Chesney
Wold
attending
on
Sir
Leicester
in
his
*NL*
rides
and
riding
very
near
his
bridle-rein
because
of
the
uncertain
*NL*
hand
with
which
he
guides
his
horse
.
But
not
to-day
is
George
so
*NL*
occupied
.
He
is
journeying
to-day
into
the
iron
country
farther
north
*NL*
to
look
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
comes
into
the
iron
country
farther
north
,
such
fresh
green
*NL*
woods
as
those
of
Chesney
Wold
are
left
behind
;
and
coal
pits
and
*NL*
ashes
,
high
chimneys
and
red
bricks
,
blighted
verdure
,
scorching
*NL*
fires
,
and
a
heavy
never-lightening
cloud
of
smoke
become
the
*NL*
features
of
the
scenery
.
Among
such
objects
rides
the
trooper
,
*NL*
looking
about
him
and
always
looking
for
something
he
has
come
to
*NL*
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
on
the
black
canal
bridge
of
a
busy
town
,
with
a
clang
of
*NL*
iron
in
it
,
and
more
fires
and
more
smoke
than
he
has
seen
yet
,
the
*NL*
trooper
,
swart
with
the
dust
of
the
coal
roads
,
checks
his
horse
and
*NL*
asks
a
workman
does
he
know
the
name
of
Rouncewell
thereabouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
master
,
''
quoth
the
workman
,
``
do
I
know
my
own
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
so
well
known
here
,
is
it
,
comrade
?
''
asks
the
trooper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rouncewell
's
?
Ah
!
You
're
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
might
it
be
now
?
''
asks
the
trooper
with
a
glance
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bank
,
the
factory
,
or
the
house
?
''
the
workman
wants
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
Rouncewell
's
is
so
great
apparently
,
''
mutters
the
trooper
,
*NL*
stroking
his
chin
,
``
that
I
have
as
good
as
half
a
mind
to
go
back
*NL*
again
.
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
which
I
want
.
Should
I
find
Mr.
Rouncewell
*NL*
at
the
factory
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tai
n't
easy
to
say
where
you
'd
find
him
--
at
this
time
of
the
day
you
*NL*
might
find
either
him
or
his
son
there
,
if
he
's
in
town
;
but
his
*NL*
contracts
take
him
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
which
is
the
factory
?
Why
,
he
sees
those
chimneys
--
the
tallest
*NL*
ones
!
Yes
,
he
sees
THEM
.
Well
!
Let
him
keep
his
eye
on
those
*NL*
chimneys
,
going
on
as
straight
as
ever
he
can
,
and
presently
he
'll
*NL*
see
'em
down
a
turning
on
the
left
,
shut
in
by
a
great
brick
wall
*NL*
which
forms
one
side
of
the
street
.
That
's
Rouncewell
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
thanks
his
informant
and
rides
slowly
on
,
looking
about
*NL*
him
.
He
does
not
turn
back
,
but
puts
up
his
horse
-LRB-
and
is
much
*NL*
disposed
to
groom
him
too
-RRB-
at
a
public-house
where
some
of
*NL*
Rouncewell
's
hands
are
dining
,
as
the
ostler
tells
him
.
Some
of
*NL*
Rouncewell
's
hands
have
just
knocked
off
for
dinner-time
and
seem
to
*NL*
be
invading
the
whole
town
.
They
are
very
sinewy
and
strong
,
are
*NL*
Rouncewell
's
hands
--
a
little
sooty
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
comes
to
a
gateway
in
the
brick
wall
,
looks
in
,
and
sees
a
great
*NL*
perplexity
of
iron
lying
about
in
every
stage
and
in
a
vast
variety
*NL*
of
shapes
--
in
bars
,
in
wedges
,
in
sheets
;
in
tanks
,
in
boilers
,
in
*NL*
axles
,
in
wheels
,
in
cogs
,
in
cranks
,
in
rails
;
twisted
and
wrenched
*NL*
into
eccentric
and
perverse
forms
as
separate
parts
of
machinery
;
*NL*
mountains
of
it
broken
up
,
and
rusty
in
its
age
;
distant
furnaces
of
*NL*
it
glowing
and
bubbling
in
its
youth
;
bright
fireworks
of
it
*NL*
showering
about
under
the
blows
of
the
steam-hammer
;
red-hot
iron
,
*NL*
white-hot
iron
,
cold-black
iron
;
an
iron
taste
,
an
iron
smell
,
and
a
*NL*
Babel
of
iron
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
place
to
make
a
man
's
head
ache
too
!
''
says
the
trooper
,
*NL*
looking
about
him
for
a
counting-house
.
``
Who
comes
here
?
This
is
very
*NL*
like
me
before
I
was
set
up
.
This
ought
to
be
my
nephew
,
if
*NL*
likenesses
run
in
families
.
Your
servant
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yours
,
sir
.
Are
you
looking
for
any
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
.
Young
Mr.
Rouncewell
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
looking
for
your
father
,
sir
.
I
wish
to
have
a
word
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
telling
him
he
is
fortunate
in
his
choice
of
a
time
,
*NL*
for
his
father
is
there
,
leads
the
way
to
the
office
where
he
is
to
*NL*
be
found
.
``
Very
like
me
before
I
was
set
up
--
devilish
like
me
!
''
*NL*
thinks
the
trooper
as
he
follows
.
They
come
to
a
building
in
the
yard
*NL*
with
an
office
on
an
upper
floor
.
At
sight
of
the
gentleman
in
the
*NL*
office
,
Mr.
George
turns
very
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
shall
I
say
to
my
father
?
''
asks
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
,
full
of
the
idea
of
iron
,
in
desperation
answers
``
Steel
,
''
and
*NL*
is
so
presented
.
He
is
left
alone
with
the
gentleman
in
the
office
,
*NL*
who
sits
at
a
table
with
account-books
before
him
and
some
sheets
of
*NL*
paper
blotted
with
hosts
of
figures
and
drawings
of
cunning
shapes
.
*NL*
It
is
a
bare
office
,
with
bare
windows
,
looking
on
the
iron
view
*NL*
below
.
Tumbled
together
on
the
table
are
some
pieces
of
iron
,
*NL*
purposely
broken
to
be
tested
at
various
periods
of
their
service
,
in
*NL*
various
capacities
.
There
is
iron-dust
on
everything
;
and
the
smoke
*NL*
is
seen
through
the
windows
rolling
heavily
out
of
the
tall
chimneys
*NL*
to
mingle
with
the
smoke
from
a
vaporous
Babylon
of
other
chimneys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
service
,
Mr.
Steel
,
''
says
the
gentleman
when
his
*NL*
visitor
has
taken
a
rusty
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Rouncewell
,
''
George
replies
,
leaning
forward
with
his
left
*NL*
arm
on
his
knee
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
very
chary
of
meeting
*NL*
his
brother
's
eye
,
``
I
am
not
without
my
expectations
that
in
the
*NL*
present
visit
I
may
prove
to
be
more
free
than
welcome
.
I
have
served
*NL*
as
a
dragoon
in
my
day
,
and
a
comrade
of
mine
that
I
was
once
rather
*NL*
partial
to
was
,
if
I
do
n't
deceive
myself
,
a
brother
of
yours
.
I
*NL*
believe
you
had
a
brother
who
gave
his
family
some
trouble
,
and
ran
*NL*
away
,
and
never
did
any
good
but
in
keeping
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
,
''
returns
the
ironmaster
in
an
altered
voice
,
*NL*
``
that
your
name
is
Steel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trooper
falters
and
looks
at
him
.
His
brother
starts
up
,
calls
*NL*
him
by
his
name
,
and
grasps
him
by
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
quick
for
me
!
''
cries
the
trooper
with
the
tears
*NL*
springing
out
of
his
eyes
.
``
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
old
fellow
?
I
*NL*
never
could
have
thought
you
would
have
been
half
so
glad
to
see
me
*NL*
as
all
this
.
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
old
fellow
,
how
do
you
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shake
hands
and
embrace
each
other
over
and
over
again
,
the
*NL*
trooper
still
coupling
his
``
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
old
fellow
!
''
with
*NL*
his
protestation
that
he
never
thought
his
brother
would
have
been
*NL*
half
so
glad
to
see
him
as
all
this
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
from
it
,
''
he
declares
at
the
end
of
a
full
account
of
what
*NL*
has
preceded
his
arrival
there
,
``
I
had
very
little
idea
of
making
*NL*
myself
known
.
I
thought
if
you
took
by
any
means
forgivingly
to
my
*NL*
name
I
might
gradually
get
myself
up
to
the
point
of
writing
a
*NL*
letter
.
But
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
,
brother
,
if
you
had
*NL*
considered
it
anything
but
welcome
news
to
hear
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
show
you
at
home
what
kind
of
news
we
think
it
,
George
,
''
*NL*
returns
his
brother
.
``
This
is
a
great
day
at
home
,
and
you
could
not
*NL*
have
arrived
,
you
bronzed
old
soldier
,
on
a
better
.
I
make
an
*NL*
agreement
with
my
son
Watt
to-day
that
on
this
day
twelvemonth
he
*NL*
shall
marry
as
pretty
and
as
good
a
girl
as
you
have
seen
in
all
your
*NL*
travels
.
She
goes
to
Germany
to-morrow
with
one
of
your
nieces
for
a
*NL*
little
polishing
up
in
her
education
.
We
make
a
feast
of
the
event
,
*NL*
and
you
will
be
made
the
hero
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
George
is
so
entirely
overcome
at
first
by
this
prospect
that
he
*NL*
resists
the
proposed
honour
with
great
earnestness
.
Being
overborne
,
*NL*
however
,
by
his
brother
and
his
nephew
--
concerning
whom
he
renews
his
*NL*
protestations
that
he
never
could
have
thought
they
would
have
been
*NL*
half
so
glad
to
see
him
--
he
is
taken
home
to
an
elegant
house
in
all
*NL*
the
arrangements
of
which
there
is
to
be
observed
a
pleasant
mixture
*NL*
of
the
originally
simple
habits
of
the
father
and
mother
with
such
as
*NL*
are
suited
to
their
altered
station
and
the
higher
fortunes
of
their
*NL*
children
.
Here
Mr.
George
is
much
dismayed
by
the
graces
and
*NL*
accomplishments
of
his
nieces
that
are
and
by
the
beauty
of
Rosa
,
his
*NL*
niece
that
is
to
be
,
and
by
the
affectionate
salutations
of
these
*NL*
young
ladies
,
which
he
receives
in
a
sort
of
dream
.
He
is
sorely
*NL*
taken
aback
,
too
,
by
the
dutiful
behaviour
of
his
nephew
and
has
a
*NL*
woeful
consciousness
upon
him
of
being
a
scapegrace
.
However
,
there
*NL*
is
great
rejoicing
and
a
very
hearty
company
and
infinite
enjoyment
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
George
comes
bluff
and
martial
through
it
all
,
and
his
pledge
*NL*
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
and
give
away
the
bride
is
received
*NL*
with
universal
favour
.
A
whirling
head
has
Mr.
George
that
night
when
*NL*
he
lies
down
in
the
state-bed
of
his
brother
's
house
to
think
of
all
*NL*
these
things
and
to
see
the
images
of
his
nieces
-LRB-
awful
all
the
*NL*
evening
in
their
floating
muslins
-RRB-
waltzing
,
after
the
German
manner
,
*NL*
over
his
counterpane
.

*NL*
The
brothers
are
closeted
next
morning
in
the
ironmaster
's
room
,
*NL*
where
the
elder
is
proceeding
,
in
his
clear
sensible
way
,
to
show
how
*NL*
he
thinks
he
may
best
dispose
of
George
in
his
business
,
when
George
*NL*
squeezes
his
hand
and
stops
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
I
thank
you
a
million
times
for
your
more
than
brotherly
*NL*
welcome
,
and
a
million
times
more
to
that
for
your
more
than
*NL*
brotherly
intentions
.
But
my
plans
are
made
.
Before
I
say
a
word
as
*NL*
to
them
,
I
wish
to
consult
you
upon
one
family
point
.
How
,
''
says
the
*NL*
trooper
,
folding
his
arms
and
looking
with
indomitable
firmness
at
*NL*
his
brother
,
``
how
is
my
mother
to
be
got
to
scratch
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sure
that
I
understand
you
,
George
,
''
replies
the
*NL*
ironmaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
brother
,
how
is
my
mother
to
be
got
to
scratch
me
?
She
must
*NL*
be
got
to
do
it
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scratch
you
out
of
her
will
,
I
think
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
.
In
short
,
''
says
the
trooper
,
folding
his
arms
more
*NL*
resolutely
yet
,
``
I
mean
--
TO
--
scratch
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
George
,
''
returns
his
brother
,
``
is
it
so
indispensable
that
*NL*
you
should
undergo
that
process
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
!
Absolutely
!
I
could
n't
be
guilty
of
the
meanness
of
coming
*NL*
back
without
it
.
I
should
never
be
safe
not
to
be
off
again
.
I
have
*NL*
not
sneaked
home
to
rob
your
children
,
if
not
yourself
,
brother
,
of
*NL*
your
rights
.
I
,
who
forfeited
mine
long
ago
!
If
I
am
to
remain
and
*NL*
hold
up
my
head
,
I
must
be
scratched
.
Come
.
You
are
a
man
of
*NL*
celebrated
penetration
and
intelligence
,
and
you
can
tell
me
how
it
's
*NL*
to
be
brought
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
,
George
,
''
replies
the
ironmaster
deliberately
,
``
how
*NL*
it
is
not
to
be
brought
about
,
which
I
hope
may
answer
the
purpose
as
*NL*
well
.
Look
at
our
mother
,
think
of
her
,
recall
her
emotion
when
she
*NL*
recovered
you
.
Do
you
believe
there
is
a
consideration
in
the
world
*NL*
that
would
induce
her
to
take
such
a
step
against
her
favourite
son
?
*NL*
Do
you
believe
there
is
any
chance
of
her
consent
,
to
balance
against
*NL*
the
outrage
it
would
be
to
her
-LRB-
loving
dear
old
lady
!
-RRB-
to
propose
it
?
*NL*
If
you
do
,
you
are
wrong
.
No
,
George
!
You
must
make
up
your
mind
to
*NL*
remain
UNscratched
,
I
think
.
''
There
is
an
amused
smile
on
the
*NL*
ironmaster
's
face
as
he
watches
his
brother
,
who
is
pondering
,
deeply
*NL*
disappointed
.
``
I
think
you
may
manage
almost
as
well
as

the
thing
*NL*
were
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
bent
upon
it

you

misfortune

way
you
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

says
the
trooper
,
pondering
again

Then
he
wistfully
*NL*
asks

with
his
hand
on
his
brother

,

Not

You
would

am
a
vagabond
of
the
harum-scarum

not

*NL*
*NL*
The
ironmaster
,
repressing
his
amused
smile

assents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

Thank
you

It
's
a
weight
off
my
mind

says
the
trooper
*NL*
with
a
heave
of
his
chest
as
he
unfolds
his
arms
and
puts
a
hand
on
*NL*
each
leg
,
``
though
I
had
set
my
heart
on
being
scratched
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
brothers
are
very
like
each
other
,
sitting
face
to
face
;
but
a
*NL*
certain
massive
simplicity
and
absence
of
usage
in
the
ways
of
the
*NL*
world
is
all
on
the
trooper
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
proceeds
,
throwing
off
his
disappointment
,
``
next
and
last
,
*NL*
those
plans
of
mine

You
have
been
so
brotherly
as
to
propose
to
me
*NL*
to
fall
in
here
and
take
my
place
among
the
products
of
your
*NL*
perseverance
and
sense
.
I
thank
you
heartily
.
It
's
more
than
*NL*
brotherly
,
as
I
said
before
,
and
I
thank
you
heartily
for
it
,
''
*NL*
shaking
him
a
long
time
by
the
hand
.
``
But
the
truth
is
,
brother

I
am
*NL*
a
--
I
am
a
kind
of
a

it

too

garden

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

''
returns
the
elder
,
concentrating
his
strong
steady
*NL*
brow
upon
him
and
smiling
confidently
,
``
leave
that
to
me

let
me
*NL*
try

*NL*
*NL*
George
shakes
his
head
.
``
You

I

not

anybody

Not

Whereas
*NL*
it
so
falls
out

on
the
other

that
I
am
able
to
be
of
some
*NL*
trifle
of
use
to
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
since
his
illness
--
brought
on
*NL*
by
family
sorrows

and
that
he
would
rather
have
that
help
from
our
*NL*
mother

son

from
anybody
else

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my

George

returns
the
other
with
a
very
slight
shade
*NL*
upon
his
open
face
,
``
if
you
prefer
to
serve
in
Sir
Leicester
*NL*
Dedlock
's
household
brigade

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is

cries
the
trooper
,
checking
him
,
with
his
*NL*
hand
upon
his
knee
again
;
``
there
it
is
!
You
do
n't
take
kindly
to
that
*NL*
idea
;
I
do
n't
mind
it
.
You
are
not
used
to
being
officered
;
I
am
.
*NL*
Everything
about
you
is
in
perfect
order
and
discipline
;
everything
*NL*
about
me
requires
to
be
kept
so
.
We
are
not
accustomed
to
carry
*NL*
things
with
the
same
hand
or
to
look
at
'em
from
the
same
point
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
much
about
my
garrison
manners
because
I
found
myself
*NL*
pretty
well
at
my
ease
last
night
,
and
they
would
n't
be
noticed
here
,
*NL*
I
dare
say
,
once
and
away
.
But
I
shall
get
on
best
at
Chesney
Wold
,
*NL*
where
there
's
more
room
for
a
weed
than
there
is
here

the
dear
*NL*
old
lady
will
be
made
happy
besides
.
Therefore
I
accept
of
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
Dedlock
's
proposals

When
I
come
over
next
year
to
give
*NL*
away
the
bride
,
or
whenever
I
come
,
I
shall
have
the
sense
to
keep
*NL*
the
household
brigade
in
ambuscade
and
not
to
manoeuvre
it
on
your
*NL*
ground
.
I
thank
you
heartily
again
and
am
proud
to
think
of
the
*NL*
Rouncewells
as
they
'll
be
founded
by
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
yourself
,
George

''
says
the
elder
brother
,
returning
the
*NL*
grip
of
his
hand
,
``
and
perhaps
you
know
me
better
than
I
know
myself

*NL*
Take
your
way

So
that
we
do
n't
quite
lose
one
another
again

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

returns
the

``
Now

I
turn
my

homewards

I
will
ask
you

if
you
'll
be
so
*NL*
good

to
look
over
a
letter
for
me

I
brought
it
with
me
to
send
from
*NL*
these
parts
,
as
Chesney
Wold
might
be
a
painful
name
just
now
to
the
*NL*
person
it
's
written
to
.
I
am
not
much
accustomed
to
correspondence
*NL*
myself
,
and
I
am
particular
respecting
this
present
letter
because
I
*NL*
want
it
to
be
both
straightforward
and
delicate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herewith
he
hands
a
letter
,
closely
written
in
somewhat
pale
ink
but
*NL*
in
a
neat
round
hand
,
to
the
ironmaster
,
who
reads
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Esther
Summerson
,
*NL*
*NL*
A
communication
having
been
made
to
me
by
Inspector
Bucket
*NL*
of
a
letter
to
myself
being
found
among
the
papers
of
a
*NL*
certain
person
,
I
take
the
liberty
to
make
known
to
you
*NL*
that
it
was
but
a
few
lines
of
instruction
from
abroad
,
*NL*
when
,
where
,
and
how
to
deliver
an
enclosed
letter
to
a
*NL*
young
and
beautiful
lady
,
then
unmarried
,
in
England
.
I
*NL*
duly
observed
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
further
take
the
liberty
to
make
known
to
you
that
it
*NL*
was
got
from
me
as
a
proof
of
handwriting
only
and
that
*NL*
otherwise
I
would
not
have
given
it
up
,
as
appearing
to
*NL*
be
the
most
harmless
in
my
possession
,
without
being
*NL*
previously
shot
through
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
further
take
the
liberty
to
mention
that
if
I
could
have
*NL*
supposed
a
certain
unfortunate
gentleman
to
have
been
in
*NL*
existence
,
I
never
could
and
never
would
have
rested
until
*NL*
I
had
discovered
his
retreat
and
shared
my
last
farthing
*NL*
with
him
,
as
my
duty
and
my
inclination
would
have
equally
*NL*
been
.
But
he
was
-LRB-
officially
-RRB-
reported
drowned
,
and
*NL*
assuredly
went
over
the
side
of
a
transport-ship
at
night
*NL*
in
an
Irish
harbour
within
a
few
hours
of
her
arrival
from
*NL*
the
West
Indies
,
as
I
have
myself
heard
both
from
officers
*NL*
and
men
on
board
,
and
know
to
have
been
-LRB-
officially
-RRB-
*NL*
confirmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
further
take
the
liberty
to
state
that
in
my
humble
*NL*
quality
as
one
of
the
rank
and
file
,
I
am
,
and
shall
ever
*NL*
continue
to
be
,
your
thoroughly
devoted
and
admiring
*NL*
servant
and
that
I
esteem
the
qualities
you
possess
above
*NL*
all
others
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
present
dispatch
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
the
honour
to
be

*NL*
GEORGE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
formal
,
''
observes
the
elder
brother
,
refolding
it
with
a
*NL*
puzzled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
nothing
that
might
not
be
sent
to
a
pattern
young
lady
?
''
asks
*NL*
the
younger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
it
is
sealed
and
deposited
for
posting
among
the
iron
*NL*
correspondence
of
the
day
.
This
done
,
Mr.
George
takes
a
hearty
*NL*
farewell
of
the
family
party
and
prepares
to
saddle
and
mount
.
His
*NL*
brother
,
however
,
unwilling
to
part
with
him
so
soon
,
proposes
to
*NL*
ride
with
him
in
a
light
open
carriage
to
the
place
where
he
will
*NL*
bait
for
the
night
,
and
there
remain
with
him
until
morning
,
a
*NL*
servant
riding
for
so
much
of
the
journey
on
the
thoroughbred
old
*NL*
grey
from
Chesney
Wold
.
The
offer
,
being
gladly
accepted
,
is
followed
*NL*
by
a
pleasant
ride
,
a
pleasant
dinner
,
and
a
pleasant
breakfast
,
all
*NL*
in
brotherly
communion
.
Then
they
once
more
shake
hands
long
and
*NL*
heartily
and
part
,
the
ironmaster
turning
his
face
to
the
smoke
and
*NL*
fires
,
and
the
trooper
to
the
green
country
.
Early
in
the
afternoon
*NL*
the
subdued
sound
of
his
heavy
military
trot
is
heard
on
the
turf
in
*NL*
the
avenue
as
he
rides
on
with
imaginary
clank
and
jingle
of
*NL*
accoutrements
under
the
old
elm-trees

CHAPTER
LXIV
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
I
had
that
conversation
with
my
guardian
,
he
put
a
sealed
*NL*
paper
in
my
hand
one
morning
and
said
,
``
This
is
for
next
month
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
''
I
found
in
it
two
hundred
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
very
quietly
to
make
such
preparations
as
I
thought
were
*NL*
necessary
.
Regulating
my
purchases
by
my
guardian
's
taste
,
which
I
*NL*
knew
very
well
of
course
,
I
arranged
my
wardrobe
to
please
him
and
*NL*
hoped
I
should
be
highly
successful
.
I
did
it
all
so
quietly
because
*NL*
I
was
not
quite
free
from
my
old
apprehension
that
Ada
would
be
*NL*
rather
sorry
and
because
my
guardian
was
so
quiet
himself
.
I
had
no
*NL*
doubt
that
under
all
the
circumstances
we
should
be
married
in
the
*NL*
most
private
and
simple
manner
.
Perhaps
I
should
only
have
to
say
to
*NL*
Ada
,
``
Would
you
like
to
come
and
see
me
married
to-morrow
,
my
pet
?
''
*NL*
Perhaps
our
wedding
might
even
be
as
unpretending
as
her
own
,
and
I
*NL*
might
not
find
it
necessary
to
say
anything
about
it
until
it
was
*NL*
over
.
I
thought
that
if
I
were
to
choose
,
I
would
like
this
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
exception
I
made
was
Mrs.
Woodcourt
.
I
told
her
that
I
was
*NL*
going
to
be
married
to
my
guardian
and
that
we
had
been
engaged
some
*NL*
time
.
She
highly
approved
.
She
could
never
do
enough
for
me
and
was
*NL*
remarkably
softened
now
in
comparison
with
what
she
had
been
when
we
*NL*
first
knew
her
.
There
was
no
trouble
she
would
not
have
taken
to
have
*NL*
been
of
use
to
me
,
but
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
only
allowed
her
to
*NL*
take
as
little
as
gratified
her
kindness
without
tasking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
this
was
not
a
time
to
neglect
my
guardian
,
and
of
course
*NL*
it
was
not
a
time
for
neglecting
my
darling
.
So
I
had
plenty
of
*NL*
occupation
,
which
I
was
glad
of
;
and
as
to
Charley
,
she
was
*NL*
absolutely
not
to
be
seen
for
needlework
.
To
surround
herself
with
*NL*
great
heaps
of
it
--
baskets
full
and
tables
full
--
and
do
a
little
,
and
*NL*
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
staring
with
her
round
eyes
at
what
*NL*
there
was
to
do
,
and
persuade
herself
that
she
was
going
to
do
it
,
*NL*
were
Charley
's
great
dignities
and
delights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
I
must
say
,
I
could
not
agree
with
my
guardian
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
will
,
and
I
had
some
sanguine
hopes
of
Jarndyce
and
*NL*
Jarndyce
.
Which
of
us
was
right
will
soon
appear
,
but
I
certainly
did
*NL*
encourage
expectations
.
In
Richard
,
the
discovery
gave
occasion
for
a
*NL*
burst
of
business
and
agitation
that
buoyed
him
up
for
a
little
time
,
*NL*
but
he
had
lost
the
elasticity
even
of
hope
now
and
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
retain
only
its
feverish
anxieties
.
From
something
my
guardian
said
*NL*
one
day
when
we
were
talking
about
this
,
I
understood
that
my
*NL*
marriage
would
not
take
place
until
after
the
term-time
we
had
been
*NL*
told
to
look
forward
to
;
and
I
thought
the
more
,
for
that
,
how
*NL*
rejoiced
I
should
be
if
I
could
be
married
when
Richard
and
Ada
were
*NL*
a
little
more
prosperous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
term
was
very
near
indeed
when
my
guardian
was
called
out
of
town
*NL*
and
went
down
into
Yorkshire
on
Mr.
Woodcourt
's
business
.
He
had
told
*NL*
me
beforehand
that
his
presence
there
would
be
necessary
.
I
had
just
*NL*
come
in
one
night
from
my
dear
girl
's
and
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
all
my
new
clothes
,
looking
at
them
all
around
me
and
thinking
,
when
*NL*
a
letter
from
my
guardian
was
brought
to
me
.
It
asked
me
to
join
him
*NL*
in
the
country
and
mentioned
by
what
stage-coach
my
place
was
taken
*NL*
and
at
what
time
in
the
morning
I
should
have
to
leave
town
.
It
added
*NL*
in
a
postscript
that
I
would
not
be
many
hours
from
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
expected
few
things
less
than
a
journey
at
that
time
,
but
I
was
*NL*
ready
for
it
in
half
an
hour
and
set
off
as
appointed
early
next
*NL*
morning
.
I
travelled
all
day
,
wondering
all
day
what
I
could
be
*NL*
wanted
for
at
such
a
distance
;
now
I
thought
it
might
be
for
this
*NL*
purpose
,
and
now
I
thought
it
might
be
for
that
purpose
,
but
I
was
*NL*
never
,
never
,
never
near
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
night
when
I
came
to
my
journey
's
end
and
found
my
guardian
*NL*
waiting
for
me
.
This
was
a
great
relief
,
for
towards
evening
I
had
*NL*
begun
to
fear
-LRB-
the
more
so
as
his
letter
was
a
very
short
one
-RRB-
that
*NL*
he
might
be
ill
.
However
,
there
he
was
,
as
well
as
it
was
possible
to
*NL*
be
;
and
when
I
saw
his
genial
face
again
at
its
brightest
and
best
,
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
,
he
has
been
doing
some
other
great
kindness
.
Not
that
*NL*
it
required
much
penetration
to
say
that
,
because
I
knew
that
his
*NL*
being
there
at
all
was
an
act
of
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
was
ready
at
the
hotel
,
and
when
we
were
alone
at
table
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Full
of
curiosity
,
no
doubt
,
little
woman
,
to
know
why
I
have
*NL*
brought
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
guardian
,
''
said
I
,
``
without
thinking
myself
a
Fatima
or
you
a
*NL*
Blue
Beard
,
I
am
a
little
curious
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
to
ensure
your
night
's
rest
,
my
love
,
''
he
returned
gaily
,
``
I
*NL*
wo
n't
wait
until
to-morrow
to
tell
you
.
I
have
very
much
wished
to
*NL*
express
to
Woodcourt
,
somehow
,
my
sense
of
his
humanity
to
poor
*NL*
unfortunate
Jo
,
his
inestimable
services
to
my
young
cousins
,
and
his
*NL*
value
to
us
all
.
When
it
was
decided
that
he
should
settle
here
,
it
*NL*
came
into
my
head
that
I
might
ask
his
acceptance
of
some
*NL*
unpretending
and
suitable
little
place
to
lay
his
own
head
in
.
I
*NL*
therefore
caused
such
a
place
to
be
looked
out
for
,
and
such
a
place
*NL*
was
found
on
very
easy
terms
,
and
I
have
been
touching
it
up
for
him
*NL*
and
making
it
habitable
.
However
,
when
I
walked
over
it
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
and
it
was
reported
ready
,
I
found
that
I
was
not
*NL*
housekeeper
enough
to
know
whether
things
were
all
as
they
ought
to
*NL*
be
.
So
I
sent
off
for
the
best
little
housekeeper
that
could
possibly
*NL*
be
got
to
come
and
give
me
her
advice
and
opinion
.
And
here
she
is
,
''
*NL*
said
my
guardian
,
``
laughing
and
crying
both
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Because
he
was
so
dear
,
so
good
,
so
admirable
.
I
tried
to
tell
him
*NL*
what
I
thought
of
him
,
but
I
could
not
articulate
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
tut
!
''
said
my
guardian
.
``
You
make
too
much
of
it
,
little
woman
.
*NL*
Why
,
how
you
sob
,
Dame
Durden
,
how
you
sob
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
with
exquisite
pleasure
,
guardian
--
with
a
heart
full
of
*NL*
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
am
delighted
that
you
approve
.
I
thought
*NL*
you
would
.
I
meant
it
as
a
pleasant
surprise
for
the
little
mistress
*NL*
of
Bleak
House
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
kissed
him
and
dried
my
eyes
.
``
I
know
now
!
''
said
I.
``
I
have
seen
*NL*
this
in
your
face
a
long
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
have
you
really
,
my
dear
?
''
said
he
.
``
What
a
Dame
Durden
it
is
to
*NL*
read
a
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
quaintly
cheerful
that
I
could
not
long
be
otherwise
,
and
*NL*
was
almost
ashamed
of
having
been
otherwise
at
all
.
When
I
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
I
cried
.
I
am
bound
to
confess
that
I
cried
;
but
I
hope
it
was
*NL*
with
pleasure
,
though
I
am
not
quite
sure
it
was
with
pleasure
.
I
*NL*
repeated
every
word
of
the
letter
twice
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
most
beautiful
summer
morning
succeeded
,
and
after
breakfast
we
*NL*
went
out
arm
in
arm
to
see
the
house
of
which
I
was
to
give
my
mighty
*NL*
housekeeping
opinion
.
We
entered
a
flower-garden
by
a
gate
in
a
side
*NL*
wall
,
of
which
he
had
the
key
,
and
the
first
thing
I
saw
was
that
the
*NL*
beds
and
flowers
were
all
laid
out
according
to
the
manner
of
my
beds
*NL*
and
flowers
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
dear
,
''
observed
my
guardian
,
standing
still
with
a
*NL*
delighted
face
to
watch
my
looks
,
``
knowing
there
could
be
no
better
*NL*
plan
,
I
borrowed
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
on
by
a
pretty
little
orchard
,
where
the
cherries
were
*NL*
nestling
among
the
green
leaves
and
the
shadows
of
the
apple-trees
*NL*
were
sporting
on
the
grass
,
to
the
house
itself
--
a
cottage
,
quite
a
*NL*
rustic
cottage
of
doll
's
rooms
;
but
such
a
lovely
place
,
so
tranquil
*NL*
and
so
beautiful
,
with
such
a
rich
and
smiling
country
spread
around
*NL*
it
;
with
water
sparkling
away
into
the
distance
,
here
all
overhung
*NL*
with
summer-growth
,
there
turning
a
humming
mill
;
at
its
nearest
*NL*
point
glancing
through
a
meadow
by
the
cheerful
town
,
where
*NL*
cricket-players
were
assembling
in
bright
groups
and
a
flag
was
*NL*
flying
from
a
white
tent
that
rippled
in
the
sweet
west
wind
.
And
*NL*
still
,
as
we
went
through
the
pretty
rooms
,
out
at
the
little
rustic
*NL*
verandah
doors
,
and
underneath
the
tiny
wooden
colonnades
garlanded
*NL*
with
woodbine
,
jasmine
,
and
honey-suckle
,
I
saw
in
the
papering
on
*NL*
the
walls
,
in
the
colours
of
the
furniture
,
in
the
arrangement
of
all
*NL*
the
pretty
objects
,
MY
little
tastes
and
fancies
,
MY
little
methods
*NL*
and
inventions
which
they
used
to
laugh
at
while
they
praised
them
,
*NL*
my
odd
ways
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
say
enough
in
admiration
of
what
was
all
so
beautiful
,
*NL*
but
one
secret
doubt
arose
in
my
mind
when
I
saw
this
,
I
thought
,
oh
,
*NL*
would
he
be
the
happier
for
it
!
Would
it
not
have
been
better
for
his
*NL*
peace
that
I
should
not
have
been
so
brought
before
him
?
Because
*NL*
although
I
was
not
what
he
thought
me
,
still
he
loved
me
very
dearly
,
*NL*
and
it
might
remind
him
mournfully
of
what
be
believed
he
had
lost
.
I
*NL*
did
not
wish
him
to
forget
me
--
perhaps
he
might
not
have
done
so
,
*NL*
without
these
aids
to
his
memory
--
but
my
way
was
easier
than
his
,
and
*NL*
I
could
have
reconciled
myself
even
to
that
so
that
he
had
been
the
*NL*
happier
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
little
woman
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
so
*NL*
proud
and
joyful
as
in
showing
me
these
things
and
watching
my
*NL*
appreciation
of
them
,
``
now
,
last
of
all
,
for
the
name
of
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
called
,
dear
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
''
said
he
,
``
come
and
see
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
me
to
the
porch
,
which
he
had
hitherto
avoided
,
and
said
,
*NL*
pausing
before
we
went
out
,
``
My
dear
child
,
do
n't
you
guess
the
*NL*
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
out
of
the
porch
and
he
showed
me
written
over
it
,
Bleak
*NL*
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
me
to
a
seat
among
the
leaves
close
by
,
and
sitting
down
*NL*
beside
me
and
taking
my
hand
in
his
,
spoke
to
me
thus
,
``
My
darling
*NL*
girl
,
in
what
there
has
been
between
us
,
I
have
,
I
hope
,
been
really
*NL*
solicitous
for
your
happiness
.
When
I
wrote
you
the
letter
to
which
*NL*
you
brought
the
answer
,
''
smiling
as
he
referred
to
it
,
``
I
had
my
own
*NL*
too
much
in
view
;
but
I
had
yours
too
.
Whether
,
under
different
*NL*
circumstances
,
I
might
ever
have
renewed
the
old
dream
I
sometimes
*NL*
dreamed
when
you
were
very
young
,
of
making
you
my
wife
one
day
,
I
*NL*
need
not
ask
myself
.
I
did
renew
it
,
and
I
wrote
my
letter
,
and
you
*NL*
brought
your
answer
.
You
are
following
what
I
say
,
my
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
cold
,
and
I
trembled
violently
,
but
not
a
word
he
uttered
was
*NL*
lost
.
As
I
sat
looking
fixedly
at
him
and
the
sun
's
rays
descended
,
*NL*
softly
shining
through
the
leaves
upon
his
bare
head
,
I
felt
as
if
*NL*
the
brightness
on
him
must
be
like
the
brightness
of
the
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
me
,
my
love
,
but
do
not
speak
.
It
is
for
me
to
speak
now
.
When
*NL*
it
was
that
I
began
to
doubt
whether
what
I
had
done
would
really
*NL*
make
you
happy
is
no
matter
.
Woodcourt
came
home
,
and
I
soon
had
no
*NL*
doubt
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
clasped
him
round
the
neck
and
hung
my
head
upon
his
breast
and
*NL*
wept
.
``
Lie
lightly
,
confidently
here
,
my
child
,
''
said
he
,
pressing
me
*NL*
gently
to
him
.
``
I
am
your
guardian
and
your
father
now
.
Rest
*NL*
confidently
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soothingly
,
like
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
leaves
;
and
genially
,
*NL*
like
the
ripening
weather
;
and
radiantly
and
beneficently
,
like
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
me
,
my
dear
girl
.
I
had
no
doubt
of
your
being
contented
*NL*
and
happy
with
me
,
being
so
dutiful
and
so
devoted
;
but
I
saw
with
*NL*
whom
you
would
be
happier
.
That
I
penetrated
his
secret
when
Dame
*NL*
Durden
was
blind
to
it
is
no
wonder
,
for
I
knew
the
good
that
could
*NL*
never
change
in
her
better
far
than
she
did
.
Well
!
I
have
long
been
*NL*
in
Allan
Woodcourt
's
confidence
,
although
he
was
not
,
until
*NL*
yesterday
,
a
few
hours
before
you
came
here
,
in
mine
.
But
I
would
not
*NL*
have
my
Esther
's
bright
example
lost
;
I
would
not
have
a
jot
of
my
*NL*
dear
girl
's
virtues
unobserved
and
unhonoured
;
I
would
not
have
her
*NL*
admitted
on
sufferance
into
the
line
of
Morgan
ap-Kerrig
,
no
,
not
for
*NL*
the
weight
in
gold
of
all
the
mountains
in
Wales
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
to
kiss
me
on
the
forehead
,
and
I
sobbed
and
wept
afresh
.
*NL*
For
I
felt
as
if
I
could
not
bear
the
painful
delight
of
his
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
little
woman
!
Do
n't
cry
;
this
is
to
be
a
day
of
joy

I
have
*NL*
looked
forward
to
it

he
said
exultingly
,
``
for
months
on
months

A
*NL*
few
words
more

Dame
Trot

and
I
have
said
my

Determined

throw
away
one
atom
of
my
Esther
's
worth
,
I
took
Mrs.
Woodcourt
into
*NL*
a
separate
confidence
.
`
Now
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
clearly
perceive
--
and
*NL*
indeed
I
know
,
to
boot
--
that
your
son
loves
my
ward
.
I
am
further
*NL*
very
sure
that
my
ward
loves
your
son
,
but
will
sacrifice
her
love
to
*NL*
a
sense
of
duty
and
affection
,
and
will
sacrifice
it
so
completely
,
*NL*
so
entirely
,
so
religiously
,
that
you
should
never
suspect
it
though
*NL*
you
watched
her
night
and
day
.
'
Then
I
told
her
all
our
*NL*
story
--
ours
--
yours
and
mine
.
`
Now
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
`
come
you
,
knowing
*NL*
this
,
and
live
with
us
.
Come
you
,
and
see
my
child
from
hour
to
hour
;
*NL*
set
what
you
see
against
her
pedigree
,
which
is
this
,
and
this
'
--
for
*NL*
I
scorned
to
mince
it
--
`
and
tell
me
what
is
the
true
legitimacy
when
*NL*
you
shall
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
on
that
subject
.
'
Why
,
honour
*NL*
to
her
old
Welsh
blood
,
my
dear
,
''
cried
my
guardian
with
enthusiasm
,
*NL*
``
I
believe
the
heart
it
animates
beats
no
less
warmly
,
no
less
*NL*
admiringly
,
no
less
lovingly
,
towards
Dame
Durden
than
my
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tenderly
raised
my
head
,
and
as
I
clung
to
him
,
kissed
me
in
his
*NL*
old
fatherly
way
again
and
again
.
What
a
light
,
now
,
on
the
*NL*
protecting
manner
I
had
thought
about
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
last
word
.
When
Allan
Woodcourt
spoke
to
you
,
my
dear
,
he
*NL*
spoke
with
my
knowledge
and
consent
--
but
I
gave
him
no
encouragement
,
*NL*
not
I
,
for
these
surprises
were
my
great
reward
,
and
I
was
too
*NL*
miserly
to
part
with
a
scrap
of
it
.
He
was
to
come
and
tell
me
all
*NL*
that
passed
,
and
he
did
.
I
have
no
more
to
say
.
My
dearest
,
Allan
*NL*
Woodcourt
stood
beside
your
father
when
he
lay
dead
--
stood
beside
*NL*
your
mother
.
This
is
Bleak
House
.
This
day
I
give
this
house
its
*NL*
little
mistress
;
and
before
God
,
it
is
the
brightest
day
in
all
my
*NL*
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
raised
me
with
him
.
We
were
no
longer
alone
.
My
*NL*
husband
--
I
have
called
him
by
that
name
full
seven
happy
years
*NL*
now
--
stood
at
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allan
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
take
from
me
a
willing
gift
,
the
best
*NL*
wife
that
ever
man
had
.
What
more
can
I
say
for
you
than
that
I
know
*NL*
you
deserve
her
!
Take
with
her
the
little
home
she
brings
you
.
You
*NL*
know
what
she
will
make
it
,
Allan
;
you
know
what
she
has
made
its
*NL*
namesake
.
Let
me
share
its
felicity
sometimes
,
and
what
do
I
*NL*
sacrifice
?
Nothing
,
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
me
once
again
,
and
now
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
as
he
*NL*
said
more
softly
,
``
Esther
,
my
dearest
,
after
so
many
years
,
there
is
*NL*
a
kind
of
parting
in
this
too

I
know
that
my
mistake
has
caused
you
*NL*
some
distress
.
Forgive
your
old
guardian
,
in
restoring
him
to
his
old
*NL*
place
in
your
affections
;
and
blot
it
out
of
your
memory

Allan
,
take
*NL*
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
away
from
under
the
green
roof
of
leaves
,
and
stopping
in
*NL*
the
sunlight
outside
and
turning
cheerfully
towards
us
,
said
,
``
I
*NL*
shall
be
found
about
here
somewhere
.
It
's
a
west
wind
,
little
woman
,
*NL*
due
west
!
Let
no
one
thank
me
any
more
,
for
I
am
going
to
revert
to
*NL*
my
bachelor
habits
,
and
if
anybody
disregards
this
warning
,
I
'll
run
*NL*
away
and
never
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
happiness
was
ours
that
day
,
what
joy
,
what
rest
,
what
hope
,
*NL*
what
gratitude
,
what
bliss
!
We
were
to
be
married
before
the
month
*NL*
was
out
,
but
when
we
were
to
come
and
take
possession
of
our
own
*NL*
house
was
to
depend
on
Richard
and
Ada
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
three
went
home
together
next
day
.
As
soon
as
we
arrived
in
*NL*
town
,
Allan
went
straight
to
see
Richard
and
to
carry
our
joyful
news
*NL*
to
him
and
my
darling
.
Late
as
it
was
,
I
meant
to
go
to
her
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
before
lying
down
to
sleep
,
but
I
went
home
with
my
guardian
*NL*
first
to
make
his
tea
for
him
and
to
occupy
the
old
chair
by
his
*NL*
side
,
for
I
did
not
like
to
think
of
its
being
empty
so
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
home
we
found
that
a
young
man
had
called
three
times
in
*NL*
the
course
of
that
one
day
to
see
me
and
that
having
been
told
on
the
*NL*
occasion
of
his
third
call
that
I
was
not
expected
to
return
before
*NL*
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
he
had
left
word
that
he
would
call
about
then
.
*NL*
He
had
left
his
card
three
times
.
Mr.
Guppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
naturally
speculated
on
the
object
of
these
visits
,
and
as
I
*NL*
always
associated
something
ludicrous
with
the
visitor
,
it
fell
out
*NL*
that
in
laughing
about
Mr.
Guppy
I
told
my
guardian
of
his
old
*NL*
proposal
and
his
subsequent
retraction
.
``
After
that
,
''
said
my
*NL*
guardian
,
``
we
will
certainly
receive
this
hero
.
''
So
instructions
were
*NL*
given
that
Mr.
Guppy
should
be
shown
in
when
he
came
again
,
and
they
*NL*
were
scarcely
given
when
he
did
come
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
embarrassed
when
he
found
my
guardian
with
me
,
but
recovered
*NL*
himself
and
said
,
``
How
de
do
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
''
returned
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
I
am
tolerable
,
''
returned
Mr.
Guppy
.
``
Will
you
allow
*NL*
me
to
introduce
my
mother
,
Mrs.
Guppy
of
the
Old
Street
Road
,
and
my
*NL*
particular
friend
,
Mr.
Weevle
.
That
is
to
say
,
my
friend
has
gone
by
*NL*
the
name
of
Weevle
,
but
his
name
is
really
and
truly
Jobling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
begged
them
to
be
seated
,
and
they
all
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tony
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
to
his
friend
after
an
awkward
silence
.
``
Will
*NL*
you
open
the
case
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
it
yourself
,
''
returned
the
friend
rather
tartly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Jarndyce
,
sir
,
''
Mr.
Guppy
,
after
a
moment
's
consideration
,
*NL*
began
,
to
the
great
diversion
of
his
mother
,
which
she
displayed
by
*NL*
nudging
Mr.
Jobling
with
her
elbow
and
winking
at
me
in
a
most
*NL*
remarkable
manner
,
``
I
had
an
idea
that
I
should
see
Miss
Summerson
by
*NL*
herself
and
was
not
quite
prepared
for
your
esteemed
presence
.
But
*NL*
Miss
Summerson
has
mentioned
to
you
,
perhaps
,
that
something
has
*NL*
passed
between
us
on
former
occasions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Summerson
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
smiling
,
``
has
made
a
*NL*
communication
to
that
effect
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
makes
matters
easier
.
Sir
,
I
have
come
out
*NL*
of
my
articles
at
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
,
and
I
believe
with
satisfaction
*NL*
to
all
parties
.
I
am
now
admitted
-LRB-
after
undergoing
an
examination
*NL*
that
's
enough
to
badger
a
man
blue
,
touching
a
pack
of
nonsense
that
*NL*
he
do
n't
want
to
know
-RRB-

have
taken
out
my

it
would

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
my
guardian
.
``
I
am
quite
willing

I
*NL*
believe
I
use
a
legal
phrase
--
to
admit
the
certificate

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
therefore
desisted
from
taking
something
out
of
his
pocket
*NL*
and
proceeded
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
capital
myself

a
little
property

takes
the
form

--
here
Mr.
Guppy
's
mother
rolled
her
*NL*
head
as
if
she
never
could
sufficiently
enjoy
the
observation
,
and
*NL*
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
,
and
again
winked
at
me
--
``
and
a
few
*NL*
pounds
for

out

will
never

be
wanting

free
of
interest
,
which
is
an
advantage

you
know

said
*NL*
Mr.
Guppy
feelingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
an
advantage

returned
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
HAVE
some
connexion

pursued
Mr.
Guppy
,
``
and
it
lays
in

direction
of
Walcot
Square

Lambeth

I
have
therefore
taken
a

ouse
*NL*
in
that
locality
,
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
my
friends
,
is
a
hollow

bargain

ridiculous

intend
setting
up
professionally
for
myself
there
forthwith

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Guppy
's
mother
fell
into
an
extraordinary
passion
of
rolling
*NL*
her
head
and
smiling
waggishly
at
anybody
who
would
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
``

in

the
opinion

commodious
tenement

When
I
mention
my
*NL*
friends

I
refer
principally
to
my
friend
Jobling

who
I
believe
has
*NL*
known

Mr.

looked
at
him
with
a
sentimental
air
,
``
from
*NL*
boyhood

hour

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jobling
confirmed
this
with
a
sliding
movement
of
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

render
me
his

there
will
be
no

My

naturally
aristocratic

taste

fully
backs

Mr.

from

seemed
much
amused

``

I

find
that

if
you
was
the
friend
you
*NL*
represent
yourself
,
I
should
think
you
might
hand
my
mother
out
of
*NL*
the
gangway
instead
of
allowing
her
to
remain
where
she
ai
n't
*NL*
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Guppy
positively
refused
to
come
out
of
the
gangway
.
She
*NL*
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
``
Why
,
get
along
with
you
,
''
said
she
to
my
*NL*
guardian
,
``
what
do
you
mean
?
Ai
n't
my
son
good
enough
for
you
?
You
*NL*
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
.
Get
out
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
lady
,
''
returned
my
guardian
,
``
it
is
hardly
reasonable
to
ask
*NL*
me
to
get
out
of
my
own
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Guppy
.
``
Get
out
with
you
.
If
we
*NL*
ai
n't
good
enough
for
you
,
go
and
procure
somebody
that
is
good
*NL*
enough
.
Go
along
and
find
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
quite
unprepared
for
the
rapid
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Guppy
's
*NL*
power
of
jocularity
merged
into
a
power
of
taking
the
profoundest
*NL*
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
and
find
somebody
that
's
good
enough
for
you
,
''
repeated
*NL*
Mrs.
Guppy
.
``
Get
out
!
''
Nothing
seemed
to
astonish
Mr.
Guppy
's
mother
*NL*
so
much
and
to
make
her
so
very
indignant
as
our
not
getting
out
.
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
get
out
?
''
said
Mrs.
Guppy
.
``
What
are
you
stopping
here
*NL*
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
interposed
her
son
,
always
getting
before
her
and
pushing
*NL*
her
back
with
one
shoulder
as
she
sidled
at
my
guardian
,
``
WILL
you
*NL*
hold
your
tongue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
William
,
''
she
returned
,
``
I
wo
n't

Not
unless
he
gets
out
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Mr.
Guppy
and
Mr.
Jobling
together
closed
on
Mr.
Guppy
's
*NL*
mother
-LRB-
who
began
to
be
quite
abusive
-RRB-
and
took
her
,
very
much
*NL*
against
her
will
,
downstairs
,
her
voice
rising
a
stair
higher
every
*NL*
time
her
figure
got
a
stair
lower
,
and
insisting
that
we
should
*NL*
immediately
go
and
find
somebody
who
was
good
enough
for
us
,
and
*NL*
above
all
things
that
we
should
get
out
.

CHAPTER
LXV
*NL*
*NL*
Beginning
the
World
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
term
had
commenced
,
and
my
guardian
found
an
intimation
from
Mr.
*NL*
Kenge
that
the
cause
would
come
on
in
two
days
.
As
I
had
sufficient
*NL*
hopes
of
the
will
to
be
in
a
flutter
about
it
,
Allan
and
I
agreed
to
*NL*
go
down
to
the
court
that
morning
.
Richard
was
extremely
agitated
and
*NL*
was
so
weak
and
low
,
though
his
illness
was
still
of
the
mind
,
that
*NL*
my
dear
girl
indeed
had
sore
occasion
to
be
supported
.
But
she
looked
*NL*
forward
--
a
very
little
way
now
--
to
the
help
that
was
to
come
to
her
,
*NL*
and
never
drooped
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
Westminster
that
the
cause
was
to
come
on
.
It
had
come
on
*NL*
there
,
I
dare
say
,
a
hundred
times
before
,
but
I
could
not
divest
*NL*
myself
of
an
idea
that
it
MIGHT
lead
to
some
result
now
.
We
left
home
*NL*
directly
after
breakfast
to
be
at
Westminster
Hall
in
good
time
and
*NL*
walked
down
there
through
the
lively
streets
--
so
happily
and
*NL*
strangely
it
seemed
!
--
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
going
along
,
planning
what
we
should
do
for
Richard
and
*NL*
Ada
,
I
heard
somebody
calling
``
Esther
!
My
dear
Esther
!
Esther
!
''
And
*NL*
there
was
Caddy
Jellyby
,
with
her
head
out
of
the
window
of
a
little
*NL*
carriage
which
she
hired
now
to
go
about
in
to
her
pupils
-LRB-
she
had
so
*NL*
many
-RRB-
,
as
if
she
wanted
to
embrace
me
at
a
hundred
yards
'
distance
.
I
*NL*
had
written
her
a
note
to
tell
her
of
all
that
my
guardian
had
done
,
*NL*
but
had
not
had
a
moment
to
go
and
see
her
.
Of
course
we
turned
back
,
*NL*
and
the
affectionate
girl
was
in
that
state
of
rapture
,
and
was
so
*NL*
overjoyed
to
talk
about
the
night
when
she
brought
me
the
flowers
,
*NL*
and
was
so
determined
to
squeeze
my
face
-LRB-
bonnet
and
all
-RRB-
between
her
*NL*
hands
,
and
go
on
in
a
wild
manner
altogether
,
calling
me
all
kinds
of
*NL*
precious
names
,
and
telling
Allan
I
had
done
I
do
n't
know
what
for
*NL*
her
,
that
I
was
just
obliged
to
get
into
the
little
carriage
and
calm
*NL*
her
down
by
letting
her
say
and
do
exactly
what
she
liked
.
Allan
,
*NL*
standing
at
the
window
,
was
as
pleased
as
Caddy
;
and
I
was
as
pleased
*NL*
as
either
of
them
;
and
I
wonder
that
I
got
away
as
I
did
,
rather
than
*NL*
that
I
came
off
laughing
,
and
red
,
and
anything
but
tidy
,
and
looking
*NL*
after
Caddy
,
who
looked
after
us
out
of
the
coach-window
as
long
as
*NL*
she
could
see
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
us
some
quarter
of
an
hour
late
,
and
when
we
came
to
*NL*
Westminster
Hall
we
found
that
the
day
's
business
was
begun
.
Worse
*NL*
than
that
,
we
found
such
an
unusual
crowd
in
the
Court
of
Chancery
*NL*
that
it
was
full
to
the
door
,
and
we
could
neither
see
nor
hear
what
*NL*
was
passing
within
.
It
appeared
to
be
something
droll
,
for
*NL*
occasionally
there
was
a
laugh
and
a
cry
of
``
Silence
!
''
It
appeared
to
*NL*
be
something
interesting
,
for
every
one
was
pushing
and
striving
to
*NL*
get
nearer
.
It
appeared
to
be
something
that
made
the
professional
*NL*
gentlemen
very
merry
,
for
there
were
several
young
counsellors
in
*NL*
wigs
and
whiskers
on
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
and
when
one
of
them
*NL*
told
the
others
about
it
,
they
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
,
and
*NL*
quite
doubled
themselves
up
with
laughter
,
and
went
stamping
about
*NL*
the
pavement
of
the
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
asked
a
gentleman
by
us
if
he
knew
what
cause
was
on
.
He
told
us
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
We
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
was
doing
in
it
.
*NL*
He
said
really
,
no
he
did
not
,
nobody
ever
did
,
but
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
make
out
,
it
was
over
.
Over
for
the
day
?
we
asked
him
.
No
,
he
*NL*
said
,
over
for
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
for
good
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
heard
this
unaccountable
answer
,
we
looked
at
one
another
*NL*
quite
lost
in
amazement
.
Could
it
be
possible
that
the
will
had
set
*NL*
things
right
at
last
and
that
Richard
and
Ada
were
going
to
be
rich
?
*NL*
It
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
.
Alas
it
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
Our
suspense
was
short
,
for
a
break-up
soon
took
place
in
the
crowd
,
*NL*
and
the
people
came
streaming
out
looking
flushed
and
hot
and
*NL*
bringing
a
quantity
of
bad
air
with
them
.
Still
they
were
all
*NL*
exceedingly
amused
and
were
more
like
people
coming
out
from
a
farce
*NL*
or
a
juggler
than
from
a
court
of
justice
.
We
stood
aside
,
watching
*NL*
for
any
countenance
we
knew
,
and
presently
great
bundles
of
paper
*NL*
began
to
be
carried
out
--
bundles
in
bags
,
bundles
too
large
to
be
got
*NL*
into
any
bags
,
immense
masses
of
papers
of
all
shapes
and
no
shapes
,
*NL*
which
the
bearers
staggered
under
,
and
threw
down
for
the
time
being
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
on
the
Hall
pavement
,
while
they
went
back
to
bring
out
more
.
*NL*
Even
these
clerks
were
laughing
.
We
glanced
at
the
papers
,
and
seeing
*NL*
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
everywhere
,
asked
an
official-looking
person
*NL*
who
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
them
whether
the
cause
was
over
.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
said
,
it
was
all
up
with
it
at
last
,
and
burst
out
laughing
*NL*
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
juncture
we
perceived
Mr.
Kenge
coming
out
of
court
with
an
*NL*
affable
dignity
upon
him
,
listening
to
Mr.
Vholes
,
who
was
*NL*
deferential
and
carried
his
own
bag
.
Mr.
Vholes
was
the
first
to
see
*NL*
us
.
``
Here
is
Miss
Summerson
,
sir
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
Mr.
Woodcourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
Yes
.
Truly
!
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
,
raising
his
hat
to
me
with
*NL*
polished
politeness
.
``
How
do
you
do
?
Glad
to
see
you
.
Mr.
Jarndyce
is
*NL*
not
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
He
never
came
there
,
I
reminded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
returned
Mr.
Kenge
,
``
it
is
as
well
that
he
is
NOT
here
*NL*
to-day
,
for
his

shall
I
say
,
in
my
good
friend
's
absence
,
his
*NL*
indomitable
singularity
of
opinion
?
--
might
have
been
strengthened
,
*NL*
perhaps
;
not
reasonably
,
but
might
have
been
strengthened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
what
has
been
done
to-day
?
''
asked
Allan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
?
''
said
Mr.
Kenge
with
excessive
urbanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
been
done
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
been
done

repeated
Mr.
Kenge
.
``
Quite
so
.
Yes
.
Why
,
not
*NL*
much
has
been
done
;
not
much

We
have
been
checked
--
brought
up
*NL*
suddenly
,

would
say

upon
the

I
term
it
threshold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
will
considered
a
genuine
document
,
sir
?
''
said
Allan
.
``
Will
*NL*
you
tell
us
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
,
if
I
could

''
said
Mr.
Kenge
;
``
but
we
have
not
gone
*NL*
into
that
,
we
have
not
gone
into
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
not
gone
into
that
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Vholes
as
if
his
low
*NL*
inward
voice
were
an
echo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
to
reflect
,
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
''
observed
Mr.
Kenge
,
using
his
*NL*
silver
trowel
persuasively
and
smoothingly
,
``
that
this
has
been
a
*NL*
great
cause
,
that
this
has
been
a
protracted
cause

that
this

*NL*
been
a
complex
cause

Jarndyce

been
termed

not
*NL*
inaptly

practice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
patience
has
sat
upon
it
a
long
time

''
said
Allan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
indeed
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Kenge
with
a
certain
*NL*
condescending
laugh
he
had
.
``
Very
well
!
You
are
further
to
reflect
,
*NL*
Mr.
Woodcourt
,
''
becoming
dignified
almost
to
severity
,
``
that
on
the
*NL*
numerous
difficulties
,
contingencies

masterly
fictions
,
and
forms
of

great

been
expended
study

ability

Allan
,
appearing
enlightened
all
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
``
Excuse

*NL*
``

Mr.

whispered
Allan

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
a
shock
of
apprehension
in
his
face
,
and
he
knew
*NL*
Richard
so
perfectly
,
and
I
too
had
seen
so
much
of
his
gradual
*NL*
decay
,
that
what
my
dear
girl
had
said
to
me
in
the
fullness
of
her
*NL*
foreboding
love
sounded
like
a
knell
in
my
ears

*NL*
*NL*
``

after

As
he
gave
me
*NL*
that
slowly
devouring
look
of
his
,
while
twisting
up
the
strings
of
*NL*
his
bag
before
he
hastened
with
it
after
Mr.
Kenge
,
the
benignant
*NL*
shadow
of
whose
conversational
presence
he
seemed
afraid
to
leave
,
he
*NL*
gave
one
gasp
as
if

had
swallowed
the
last
morsel
of
his
client

and
his
black
buttoned-up
unwholesome
figure
glided
away
to
the

door
at

coach
,
but
entreated
him
to
go
to
*NL*
Richard
without
a
moment
's
delay
and
leave
me
to
do
as
he
wished
.
*NL*
Hurrying
home
,
I
found
my
guardian
and
told
him
gradually
with
what
*NL*
news
I
had
returned
.
``
Little
woman
,
''
said
he
,
quite
unmoved
for
*NL*
himself
,
``
to
have
done
with
the
suit
on
any
terms
is
a
greater
*NL*
blessing
than
I
had
looked
for
.
But
my
poor
young
cousins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
talked
about
them
all
the
morning
and
discussed
what
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
do
.
In
the
afternoon
my
guardian
walked
with
me
to
*NL*
Symond
's
Inn
and
left
me
at
the
door
.
I
went
upstairs
.
When
my
*NL*
darling
heard
my
footsteps
,
she
came
out
into
the
small
passage
and
*NL*
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
,
but
she
composed
herself
directly
and
*NL*
said
that
Richard
had
asked
for
me
several
times
.
Allan
had
found
him
*NL*
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
court
,
she
told
me
,
like
a
stone
figure
.
*NL*
On
being
roused
,
he
had
broken
away
and
made
as
if
he
would
have
*NL*
spoken
in
a
fierce
voice
to
the
judge
.
He
was
stopped
by
his
mouth
*NL*
being
full
of
blood
,
and
Allan
had
brought
him
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lying
on
a
sofa
with
his
eyes
closed
when
I
went
in
.
There
*NL*
were
restoratives
on
the
table
;
the
room
was
made
as
airy
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
was
darkened
,
and
was
very
orderly
and
quiet
.
Allan
*NL*
stood
behind
him
watching
him
gravely
.
His
face
appeared
to
me
to
be
*NL*
quite
destitute
of
colour
,
and
now
that
I
saw
him
without
his
seeing
*NL*
me
,
I
fully
saw
,
for
the
first
time
,
how
worn
away
he
was
.
But
he
*NL*
looked
handsomer
than
I
had
seen
him
look
for
many
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
by
his
side
in
silence
.
Opening
his
eyes
by
and
by
,
he
*NL*
said
in
a
weak
voice
,
but
with
his
old
smile
,
``
Dame
Durden
,
kiss
me
,
*NL*
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
comfort
and
surprise
to
me
to
find
him
in
his
low
*NL*
state
cheerful
and
looking
forward
.
He
was
happier
,
he
said
,
in
our
*NL*
intended
marriage
than
he
could
find
words
to
tell
me
.
My
husband
had
*NL*
been
a
guardian
angel
to
him
and
Ada
,
and
he
blessed
us
both
and
*NL*
wished
us
all
the
joy
that
life
could
yield
us
.
I
almost
felt
as
if
*NL*
my
own
heart
would
have
broken
when
I
saw
him
take
my
husband
's
hand
*NL*
and
hold
it
to
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
spoke
of
the
future
as
much
as
possible
,
and
he
said
several
times
*NL*
that
he
must
be
present
at
our
marriage
if
he
could
stand
upon
his
*NL*
feet
.
Ada
would
contrive
to
take
him
,
somehow
,
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
surely
,
*NL*
dearest
Richard
!
''
But
as
my
darling
answered
him
thus
hopefully
,
so
*NL*
serene
and
beautiful
,
with
the
help
that
was
to
come
to
her
so
*NL*
near
--
I
knew
--
I
knew
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
good
for
him
to
talk
too
much
,
and
when
he
was
silent
,
we
*NL*
were
silent
too
.
Sitting
beside
him
,
I
made
a
pretence
of
working
for
*NL*
my
dear
,
as
he
had
always
been
used
to
joke
about
my
being
busy
.
Ada
*NL*
leaned
upon
his
pillow
,
holding
his
head
upon
her
arm
.
He
dozed
*NL*
often
,
and
whenever
he
awoke
without
seeing
him
,
said
first
of
all
,
*NL*
``
Where
is
Woodcourt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
had
come
on
when
I
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
saw
my
guardian
*NL*
standing
in
the
little
hall
.
``
Who
is
that
,
Dame
Durden
?
''
Richard
*NL*
asked
me
.
The
door
was
behind
him
,
but
he
had
observed
in
my
face
*NL*
that
some
one
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
to
Allan
for
advice
,
and
as
he
nodded
``
Yes
,
''
bent
over
*NL*
Richard
and
told
him
.
My
guardian
saw
what
passed
,
came
softly
by
me
*NL*
in
a
moment
,
and
laid
his
hand
on
Richard
's
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
said
Richard
,
*NL*
``
you
are
a
good
man
,
you
are
a
good
man
!
''
and
burst
into
tears
for
*NL*
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
,
the
picture
of
a
good
man
,
sat
down
in
my
place
,
keeping
*NL*
his
hand
on
Richard
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rick
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
clouds
have
cleared
away
,
and
it
is
*NL*
bright
now
.
We
can
see
now
.
We
were
all
bewildered
,
Rick
,
more
or
*NL*
less
.
What
matters
!
And
how
are
you
,
my
dear
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
weak
,
sir
,
but
I
hope
I
shall
be
stronger
.
I
have
to
begin
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
truly
;
well
said
!
''
cried
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
begin
it
in
the
old
way
now
,
''
said
Richard
with
a
sad
*NL*
smile
.
``
I
have
learned
a
lesson
now
,
sir
.
It
was
a
hard
one
,
but
you
*NL*
shall
be
assured
,
indeed
,
that
I
have
learned
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
comforting
him
;
``
well
,
well
,
well
,
*NL*
dear
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
,
sir
,
''
resumed
Richard
,
``
that
there
is
nothing
on
*NL*
earth
I
should
so
much
like
to
see
as
their
house
--
Dame
Durden
's
and
*NL*
Woodcourt
's
house
.
If
I
could
be
removed
there
when
I
begin
to
*NL*
recover
my
strength
,
I
feel
as
if
I
should
get
well
there
sooner
than
*NL*
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
so
have
I
been
thinking
too
,
Rick
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
``
and
our
*NL*
little
woman
likewise
;
she
and
I
have
been
talking
of
it
this
very
*NL*
day
.
I
dare
say
her
husband
wo
n't
object
.
What
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richard
smiled
and
lifted
up
his
arm
to
touch
him
as
he
stood
behind
*NL*
the
head
of
the
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
nothing
of
Ada
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
but
I
think
of
her
,
and
have
*NL*
thought
of
her
very
much
.
Look
at
her
!
See
her
here
,
sir
,
bending
*NL*
over
this
pillow
when
she
has
so
much
need
to
rest
upon
it
herself
,
*NL*
my
dear
love
,
my
poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clasped
her
in
his
arms
,
and
none
of
us
spoke
.
He
gradually
*NL*
released
her
,
and
she
looked
upon
us
,
and
looked
up
to
heaven
,
and
*NL*
moved
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
get
down
to
Bleak
House
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
I
shall
have
much
to
*NL*
tell
you
,
sir
,
and
you
will
have
much
to
show
me
.
You
will
go
,
wo
n't
*NL*
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly

Rick

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
like
you

like
you
,
''
said
Richard
.
``
But
it
's
all
like
*NL*
you

They
have
been
telling
me
how
you
planned
it
and
how
you
*NL*
remembered
all
Esther
's
familiar
tastes
and
ways

It
will
be
like

coming
to
the
old
Bleak
House
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
come
there
too
,
I
hope

Rick

I
am
a
solitary
man
now
,
*NL*
you
know

and
it
will
be
a
charity
to
come
to
me
.
A
charity
to
come
*NL*
to
me
,
my
love
!
''
he
repeated
to
Ada
as
he
gently
passed
his
hand
over
*NL*
her
golden
hair
and
put
a
lock
of
it
to
his
lips
.
-LRB-
I
think
he
vowed
*NL*
within
himself
to
cherish
her
if
she
were
left
alone
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
troubled
dream
?
''
said
Richard
,
clasping
both
my
guardian
's
*NL*
hands
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
more
,
Rick
;
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
being
a
good
man
,
can
pass
it
as
such
,
and
forgive
and
pity
*NL*
the
dreamer
,
and
be
lenient
and
encouraging
when
he
wakes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
can
.
What
am
I
but
another
dreamer
,
Rick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
begin
the
world
!
''
said
Richard
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
husband
drew
a
little
nearer
towards
Ada
,
and
I
saw
him
solemnly
*NL*
lift
up
his
hand
to
warn
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
shall
I
go
from
this
place
to
that
pleasant
country
where
the
*NL*
old
times
are
,
where
I
shall
have
strength
to
tell
what
Ada
has
been
*NL*
to
me
,
where
I
shall
be
able
to
recall
my
many
faults
and
*NL*
blindnesses
,
where
I
shall
prepare
myself
to
be
a
guide
to
my
unborn
*NL*
child
?
''
said
Richard
.
``
When
shall
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Rick
,
when
you
are
strong
enough
,
''
returned
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ada
,
my
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sought
to
raise
himself
a
little
.
Allan
raised
him
so
that
she
*NL*
could
hold
him
on
her
bosom
,
which
was
what
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
done
you
many
wrongs

my
own

I
have
fallen
like
a
poor
stray
*NL*
shadow
on
your
way
,
I
have
married
you
to
poverty
and
trouble
,
I
have
*NL*
scattered
your
means
to
the
winds
.
You
will
forgive
me
all
this
,
my
*NL*
Ada
,
before
I
begin
the
world
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
irradiated
his
face
as
she
bent
to
kiss
him
.
He
slowly
laid
*NL*
his
face
down
upon
her
bosom
,
drew
his
arms
closer
round
her
neck
,
*NL*
and
with
one
parting
sob
began
the
world
.
Not
this
world
,
oh
,
not
*NL*
this
!
The
world
that
sets
this
right

*NL*
*NL*
When
all
was
still
,
at
a
late
hour
,
poor
crazed
Miss
Flite
came
*NL*
weeping
to
me
and
told
me
she
had
given
her
birds
their
liberty

CHAPTER
LXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Down
in
Lincolnshire
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
hush
upon
Chesney
Wold
in
these
altered
days
,
as
there
is
*NL*
upon
a
portion
of
the
family
history
.
The
story
goes
that
Sir
*NL*
Leicester
paid
some
who
could
have
spoken
out
to
hold
their
peace
;
*NL*
but
it
is
a
lame
story
,
feebly
whispering
and
creeping
about
,
and
any
*NL*
brighter
spark
of
life
it
shows
soon
dies
away
.
It
is
known
for
*NL*
certain
that
the
handsome
Lady
Dedlock
lies
in
the
mausoleum
in
the
*NL*
park
,
where
the
trees
arch
darkly
overhead
,
and
the
owl
is
heard
at
*NL*
night
making
the
woods
ring
;
but
whence
she
was
brought
home
to
be
*NL*
laid
among
the
echoes
of
that
solitary
place
,
or
how
she
died
,
is
all
*NL*
mystery
.
Some
of
her
old
friends
,
principally
to
be
found
among
the
*NL*
peachy-cheeked
charmers
with
the
skeleton
throats
,
did
once
*NL*
occasionally
say
,
as
they
toyed
in
a
ghastly
manner
with
large
*NL*
fans
--
like
charmers
reduced
to
flirting
with
grim
death
,
after
losing
*NL*
all
their
other
beaux
--
did
once
occasionally
say
,
when
the
world
*NL*
assembled
together
,
that
they
wondered
the
ashes
of
the
Dedlocks
,
*NL*
entombed
in
the
mausoleum
,
never
rose
against
the
profanation
of
her
*NL*
company
.
But
the
dead-and-gone
Dedlocks
take
it
very
calmly
and
have
*NL*
never
been
known
to
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
from
among
the
fern
in
the
hollow
,
and
winding
by
the
bridle-road
*NL*
among
the
trees
,
comes
sometimes
to
this
lonely
spot
the
sound
of
*NL*
horses
'
hoofs
.
Then
may
be
seen
Sir
Leicester
--
invalided
,
bent
,
and
*NL*
almost
blind
,
but
of
worthy
presence
yet
--
riding
with
a
stalwart
man
*NL*
beside
him
,
constant
to
his
bridle-rein
.
When
they
come
to
a
certain
*NL*
spot
before
the
mausoleum-door
,
Sir
Leicester
's
accustomed
horse
*NL*
stops
of
his
own
accord
,
and
Sir
Leicester
,
pulling
off
his
hat
,
is
*NL*
still
for
a
few
moments
before
they
ride
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
War
rages
yet
with
the
audacious
Boythorn
,
though
at
uncertain
*NL*
intervals
,
and
now
hotly
,
and
now
coolly
,
flickering
like
an
unsteady
*NL*
fire
.
The
truth
is
said
to
be
that
when
Sir
Leicester
came
down
to
*NL*
Lincolnshire
for
good
,
Mr.
Boythorn
showed
a
manifest
desire
to
*NL*
abandon
his
right
of
way
and
do
whatever
Sir
Leicester
would
,
which
*NL*
Sir
Leicester
,
conceiving
to
be
a
condescension
to
his
illness
or
*NL*
misfortune
,
took
in
such
high
dudgeon
,
and
was
so
magnificently
*NL*
aggrieved
by
,
that
Mr.
Boythorn
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
*NL*
committing
a
flagrant
trespass
to
restore
his
neighbour
to
himself
.
*NL*
Similarly
,
Mr.
Boythorn
continues
to
post
tremendous
placards
on
the
*NL*
disputed
thoroughfare
and
-LRB-
with
his
bird
upon
his
head
-RRB-
to
hold
forth
*NL*
vehemently
against
Sir
Leicester
in
the
sanctuary
of
his
own
home
;
*NL*
similarly
,
also
,
he
defies
him
as
of
old
in
the
little
church
by
*NL*
testifying
a
bland
unconsciousness
of
his
existence
.
But
it
is
*NL*
whispered
that
when
he
is
most
ferocious
towards
his
old
foe
,
he
is
*NL*
really
most
considerate
,
and
that
Sir
Leicester
,
in
the
dignity
of
*NL*
being
implacable
,
little
supposes
how
much
he
is
humoured
.
As
little
*NL*
does
he
think
how
near
together
he
and
his
antagonist
have
suffered
*NL*
in
the
fortunes
of
two
sisters
,
and
his
antagonist
,
who
knows
it
now
,
*NL*
is
not
the
man
to
tell
him
.
So
the
quarrel
goes
on
to
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
the
lodges
of
the
park
--
that
lodge
within
sight
of
the
*NL*
house
where
,
once
upon
a
time
,
when
the
waters
were
out
down
in
*NL*
Lincolnshire
,
my
Lady
used
to
see
the
keeper
's
child
--
the
stalwart
*NL*
man
,
the
trooper
formerly
,
is
housed
.
Some
relics
of
his
old
calling
*NL*
hang
upon
the
walls
,
and
these
it
is
the
chosen
recreation
of
a
*NL*
little
lame
man
about
the
stable-yard
to
keep
gleaming
bright
.
A
busy
*NL*
little
man
he
always
is
,
in
the
polishing
at
harness-house
doors
,
of
*NL*
stirrup-irons
,
bits
,
curb-chains
,
harness
bosses
,
anything
in
the
way
*NL*
of
a
stable-yard
that
will
take
a
polish
,
leading
a
life
of
friction
.
*NL*
A
shaggy
little
damaged
man
,
withal
,
not
unlike
an
old
dog
of
some
*NL*
mongrel
breed
,
who
has
been
considerably
knocked
about
.
He
answers
to
*NL*
the
name
of
Phil
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
goodly
sight
it
is
to
see
the
grand
old
housekeeper
-LRB-
harder
of
*NL*
hearing
now
-RRB-
going
to
church
on
the
arm
of
her
son
and
to
*NL*
observe
--
which
few
do
,
for
the
house
is
scant
of
company
in
these
*NL*
times
--
the
relations
of
both
towards
Sir
Leicester
,
and
his
towards
*NL*
them
.
They
have
visitors
in
the
high
summer
weather
,
when
a
grey
*NL*
cloak
and
umbrella
,
unknown
to
Chesney
Wold
at
other
periods
,
are
*NL*
seen
among
the
leaves
;
when
two
young
ladies
are
occasionally
found
*NL*
gambolling
in
sequestered
saw-pits
and
such
nooks
of
the
park
;
and
*NL*
when
the
smoke
of
two
pipes
wreathes
away
into
the
fragrant
evening
*NL*
air
from
the
trooper
's
door
.
Then
is
a
fife
heard
trolling
within
the
*NL*
lodge
on
the
inspiring
topic
of
the
``
British
Grenadiers
''
;
and
as
the
*NL*
evening
closes
in
,
a
gruff
inflexible
voice
is
heard
to
say
,
while
*NL*
two
men
pace
together
up
and
down
,
``
But
I
never
own
to
it
before
the
*NL*
old
girl
.
Discipline
must
be
maintained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
the
house
is
shut
up
,
and
it
is
a
show-house
no
*NL*
longer
;
yet
Sir
Leicester
holds
his
shrunken
state
in
the
long
*NL*
drawing-room
for
all
that
,
and
reposes
in
his
old
place
before
my
*NL*
Lady
's
picture
.
Closed
in
by
night
with
broad
screens
,
and
illumined
*NL*
only
in
that
part
,
the
light
of
the
drawing-room
seems
gradually
*NL*
contracting
and
dwindling
until
it
shall
be
no
more
.
A
little
more
,
*NL*
in
truth
,
and
it
will
be
all
extinguished
for
Sir
Leicester
;
and
the
*NL*
damp
door
in
the
mausoleum
which
shuts
so
tight
,
and
looks
so
*NL*
obdurate
,
will
have
opened
and
received
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Volumnia
,
growing
with
the
flight
of
time
pinker
as
to
the
red
in
her
*NL*
face
,
and
yellower
as
to
the
white
,
reads
to
Sir
Leicester
in
the
*NL*
long
evenings
and
is
driven
to
various
artifices
to
conceal
her
*NL*
yawns
,
of
which
the
chief
and
most
efficacious
is
the
insertion
of
*NL*
the
pearl
necklace
between
her
rosy
lips
.
Long-winded
treatises
on
*NL*
the
Buffy
and
Boodle
question
,
showing
how
Buffy
is
immaculate
and
*NL*
Boodle
villainous
,
and
how
the
country
is
lost
by
being
all
Boodle
*NL*
and
no
Buffy
,
or
saved
by
being
all
Buffy
and
no
Boodle
-LRB-
it
must
be
*NL*
one
of
the
two
,
and
can
not
be
anything
else
-RRB-
,
are
the
staple
of
her
*NL*
reading
.
Sir
Leicester
is
not
particular
what
it
is
and
does
not
*NL*
appear
to
follow
it
very
closely
,
further
than
that
he
always
comes
*NL*
broad
awake
the
moment
Volumnia
ventures
to
leave
off
,
and
sonorously
*NL*
repeating
her
last
words
,
begs
with
some
displeasure
to
know
if
she
*NL*
finds
herself
fatigued
.
However
,
Volumnia
,
in
the
course
of
her
*NL*
bird-like
hopping
about
and
pecking
at
papers
,
has
alighted
on
a
*NL*
memorandum
concerning
herself
in
the
event
of
``
anything
happening
''
to
*NL*
her
kinsman
,
which
is
handsome
compensation
for
an
extensive
course
*NL*
of
reading
and
holds
even
the
dragon
Boredom
at
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cousins
generally
are
rather
shy
of
Chesney
Wold
in
its
dullness
,
*NL*
but
take
to
it
a
little
in
the
shooting
season
,
when
guns
are
heard
*NL*
in
the
plantations
,
and
a
few
scattered
beaters
and
keepers
wait
at
*NL*
the
old
places
of
appointment
for
low-spirited
twos
and
threes
of
*NL*
cousins
.
The
debilitated
cousin
,
more
debilitated
by
the
dreariness
*NL*
of
the
place
,
gets
into
a
fearful
state
of
depression
,
groaning
under
*NL*
penitential
sofa-pillows
in
his
gunless
hours
and
protesting
that
*NL*
such
fernal
old
jail
's
--
nough
t
`
sew
fler
up
--
frever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
great
occasions
for
Volumnia
in
this
changed
aspect
of
the
*NL*
place
in
Lincolnshire
are
those
occasions
,
rare
and
widely
separated
,
*NL*
when
something
is
to
be
done
for
the
county
or
the
country
in
the
way
*NL*
of
gracing
a
public
ball
.
Then
,
indeed
,
does
the
tuckered
sylph
come
*NL*
out
in
fairy
form
and
proceed
with
joy
under
cousinly
escort
to
the
*NL*
exhausted
old
assembly-room
,
fourteen
heavy
miles
off
,
which
,
during
*NL*
three
hundred
and
sixty-four
days
and
nights
of
every
ordinary
year
,
*NL*
is
a
kind
of
antipodean
lumber-room
full
of
old
chairs
and
tables
*NL*
upside
down
.
Then
,
indeed
,
does
she
captivate
all
hearts
by
her
*NL*
condescension
,
by
her
girlish
vivacity
,
and
by
her
skipping
about
as
*NL*
in
the
days
when
the
hideous
old
general
with
the
mouth
too
full
of
*NL*
teeth
had
not
cut
one
of
them
at
two
guineas
each
.
Then
does
she
*NL*
twirl
and
twine
,
a
pastoral
nymph
of
good
family
,
through
the
mazes
*NL*
of
the
dance
.
Then
do
the
swains
appear
with
tea
,
with
lemonade
,
with
*NL*
sandwiches
,
with
homage
.
Then
is
she
kind
and
cruel
,
stately
and
*NL*
unassuming
,
various
,
beautifully
wilful
.
Then
is
there
a
singular
*NL*
kind
of
parallel
between
her
and
the
little
glass
chandeliers
of
*NL*
another
age
embellishing
that
assembly-room
,
which
,
with
their
meagre
*NL*
stems
,
their
spare
little
drops
,
their
disappointing
knobs
where
no
*NL*
drops
are
,
their
bare
little
stalks
from
which
knobs
and
drops
have
*NL*
both
departed
,
and
their
little
feeble
prismatic
twinkling
,
all
seem
*NL*
Volumnias
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
rest
,
Lincolnshire
life
to
Volumnia
is
a
vast
blank
of
*NL*
overgrown
house
looking
out
upon
trees
,
sighing
,
wringing
their
*NL*
hands
,
bowing
their
heads
,
and
casting
their
tears
upon
the
*NL*
window-panes
in
monotonous
depressions
.
A
labyrinth
of
grandeur
,
less
*NL*
the
property
of
an
old
family
of
human
beings
and
their
ghostly
*NL*
likenesses
than
of
an
old
family
of
echoings
and
thunderings
which
*NL*
start
out
of
their
hundred
graves
at
every
sound
and
go
resounding
*NL*
through
the
building
.
A
waste
of
unused
passages
and
staircases
in
*NL*
which
to
drop
a
comb
upon
a
bedroom
floor
at
night
is
to
send
a
*NL*
stealthy
footfall
on
an
errand
through
the
house
.
A
place
where
few
*NL*
people
care
to
go
about
alone
,
where
a
maid
screams
if
an
ash
drops
*NL*
from
the
fire
,
takes
to
crying
at
all
times
and
seasons
,
becomes
the
*NL*
victim
of
a
low
disorder
of
the
spirits
,
and
gives
warning
and
*NL*
departs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Chesney
Wold
.
With
so
much
of
itself
abandoned
to
darkness
and
*NL*
vacancy
;
with
so
little
change
under
the
summer
shining
or
the
wintry
*NL*
lowering
;
so
sombre
and
motionless
always
--
no
flag
flying
now
by
day
,
*NL*
no
rows
of
lights
sparkling
by
night
;
with
no
family
to
come
and
go
,
*NL*
no
visitors
to
be
the
souls
of
pale
cold
shapes
of
rooms
,
no
stir
of
*NL*
life
about
it
--
passion
and
pride
,
even
to
the
stranger
's
eye
,
have
*NL*
died
away
from
the
place
in
Lincolnshire
and
yielded
it
to
dull
*NL*
repose
.

CHAPTER
LXVII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Close
of
Esther
's
Narrative
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Full
seven
happy
years
I
have
been
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
.
The
*NL*
few
words
that
I
have
to
add
to
what
I
have
written
are
soon
penned
;
*NL*
then
I
and
the
unknown
friend
to
whom
I
write
will
part
for
ever
.
Not
*NL*
without
much
dear
remembrance
on
my
side
.
Not
without
some
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
on
his
or
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gave
my
darling
into
my
arms
,
and
through
many
weeks
I
never
*NL*
left
her
.
The
little
child
who
was
to
have
done
so
much
was
born
*NL*
before
the
turf
was
planted
on
its
father
's
grave
.
It
was
a
boy
;
and
*NL*
I
,
my
husband
,
and
my
guardian
gave
him
his
father
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
help
that
my
dear
counted
on
did
come
to
her
,
though
it
came
,
in
*NL*
the
eternal
wisdom
,
for
another
purpose
.
Though
to
bless
and
restore
*NL*
his
mother
,
not
his
father
,
was
the
errand
of
this
baby
,
its
power
*NL*
was
mighty
to
do
it
.
When
I
saw
the
strength
of
the
weak
little
hand
*NL*
and
how
its
touch
could
heal
my
darling
's
heart
and
raised
hope
*NL*
within
her
,
I
felt
a
new
sense
of
the
goodness
and
the
tenderness
of
*NL*
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
throve
,
and
by
degrees
I
saw
my
dear
girl
pass
into
my
country
*NL*
garden
and
walk
there
with
her
infant
in
her
arms
.
I
was
married
*NL*
then
.
I
was
the
happiest
of
the
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
time
that
my
guardian
joined
us
and
asked
Ada
when
she
*NL*
would
come
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
houses
are
your
home
,
my
dear
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
the
older
Bleak
*NL*
House
claims
priority
.
When
you
and
my
boy
are
strong
enough
to
do
*NL*
it
,
come
and
take
possession
of
your
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ada
called
him
``
her
dearest
cousin
,
John
.
''
But
he
said
,
no
,
it
must
*NL*
be
guardian
now
.
He
was
her
guardian
henceforth
,
and
the
boy
's
;
and
*NL*
he
had
an
old
association
with
the
name
.
So
she
called
him
guardian
,
*NL*
and
has
called
him
guardian
ever
since
.
The
children
know
him
by
no
*NL*
other
name
.
I
say
the
children
;
I
have
two
little
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
difficult
to
believe
that
Charley
-LRB-
round-eyed
still
,
and
not
at
*NL*
all
grammatical
-RRB-
is
married
to
a
miller
in
our
neighbourhood
;
yet
so
*NL*
it
is
;
and
even
now
,
looking
up
from
my
desk
as
I
write
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
at
my
summer
window
,
I
see
the
very
mill
beginning
to
go
*NL*
round
.
I
hope
the
miller
will
not
spoil
Charley
;
but
he
is
very
fond
*NL*
of
her
,
and
Charley
is
rather
vain
of
such
a
match
,
for
he
is
well
to
*NL*
do
and
was
in
great
request
.
So
far
as
my
small
maid
is
concerned
,
I
*NL*
might
suppose
time
to
have
stood
for
seven
years
as
still
as
the
mill
*NL*
did
half
an
hour
ago
,
since
little
Emma
,
Charley
's
sister
,
is
exactly
*NL*
what
Charley
used
to
be
.
As
to
Tom
,
Charley
's
brother
,
I
am
really
*NL*
afraid
to
say
what
he
did
at
school
in
ciphering
,
but
I
think
it
was
*NL*
decimals
.
He
is
apprenticed
to
the
miller
,
whatever
it
was
,
and
is
a
*NL*
good
bashful
fellow
,
always
falling
in
love
with
somebody
and
being
*NL*
ashamed
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caddy
Jellyby
passed
her
very
last
holidays
with
us
and
was
a
dearer
*NL*
creature
than
ever
,
perpetually
dancing
in
and
out
of
the
house
with
*NL*
the
children
as
if
she
had
never
given
a
dancing-lesson
in
her
life
.
*NL*
Caddy
keeps
her
own
little
carriage
now
instead
of
hiring
one
,
and
*NL*
lives
full
two
miles
further
westward
than
Newman
Street
.
She
works
*NL*
very
hard
,
her
husband
-LRB-
an
excellent
one
-RRB-
being
lame
and
able
to
do
*NL*
very
little
.
Still
,
she
is
more
than
contented
and
does
all
she
has
*NL*
to
do
with
all
her
heart
.
Mr.
Jellyby
spends
his
evenings
at
her
new
*NL*
house
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
he
used
to
do
in
her
old
one
.
*NL*
I
have
heard
that
Mrs.
Jellyby
was
understood
to
suffer
great
*NL*
mortification
from
her
daughter
's
ignoble
marriage
and
pursuits
,
but
*NL*
I
hope
she
got
over
it
in
time
.
She
has
been
disappointed
in
*NL*
Borrioboola-Gha
,
which
turned
out
a
failure
in
consequence
of
the
*NL*
king
of
Borrioboola
wanting
to
sell
everybody
--
who
survived
the
*NL*
climate
--
for
rum
,
but
she
has
taken
up
with
the
rights
of
women
to
*NL*
sit
in
Parliament
,
and
Caddy
tells
me
it
is
a
mission
involving
more
*NL*
correspondence
than
the
old
one
.
I
had
almost
forgotten
Caddy
's
poor
*NL*
little
girl
.
She
is
not
such
a
mite
now
,
but
she
is
deaf
and
dumb
.
I
*NL*
believe
there
never
was
a
better
mother
than
Caddy
,
who
learns
,
in
*NL*
her
scanty
intervals
of
leisure
,
innumerable
deaf
and
dumb
arts
to
*NL*
soften
the
affliction
of
her
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
I
were
never
to
have
done
with
Caddy
,
I
am
reminded
here
of
*NL*
Peepy
and
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
.
Peepy
is
in
the
Custom
House
,
and
doing
*NL*
extremely
well
.
Old
Mr.
Turveydrop
,
very
apoplectic
,
still
exhibits
*NL*
his
deportment
about
town
,
still
enjoys
himself
in
the
old
manner
,
is
*NL*
still
believed
in
in
the
old
way
.
He
is
constant
in
his
patronage
of
*NL*
Peepy
and
is
understood
to
have
bequeathed
him
a
favourite
French
*NL*
clock
in
his
dressing-room
--
which
is
not
his
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
first
money
we
saved
at
home
,
we
added
to
our
pretty
house
*NL*
by
throwing
out
a
little
growlery
expressly
for
my
guardian
,
which
we
*NL*
inaugurated
with
great
splendour
the
next
time
he
came
down
to
see
*NL*
us
.
I
try
to
write
all
this
lightly
,
because
my
heart
is
full
in
*NL*
drawing
to
an
end
,
but
when
I
write
of
him
,
my
tears
will
have
their
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
look
at
him
but
I
hear
our
poor
dear
Richard
calling
him
a
*NL*
good
man
.
To
Ada
and
her
pretty
boy
,
he
is
the
fondest
father
;
to
me
*NL*
he
is
what
he
has
ever
been
,
and
what
name
can
I
give
to
that
?
He
is
*NL*
my
husband
's
best
and
dearest
friend
,
he
is
our
children
's
darling
,
*NL*
he
is
the
object
of
our
deepest
love
and
veneration
.
Yet
while
I
feel
*NL*
towards
him
as
if
he
were
a
superior
being
,
I
am
so
familiar
with
him
*NL*
and
so
easy
with
him
that
I
almost
wonder
at
myself
.
I
have
never
*NL*
lost
my
old
names
,
nor
has
he
lost
his
;
nor
do
I
ever
,
when
he
is
*NL*
with
us
,
sit
in
any
other
place
than
in
my
old
chair
at
his
side
,
*NL*
Dame
Trot
,
Dame
Durden
,
Little
Woman
--
all
just
the
same
as
ever
;
and
*NL*
I
answer
,
``
Yes
,
dear
guardian
!
''
just
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
known
the
wind
to
be
in
the
east
for
a
single
moment
*NL*
since
the
day
when
he
took
me
to
the
porch
to
read
the
name
.
I
*NL*
remarked
to
him
once
that
the
wind
seemed
never
in
the
east
now
,
and
*NL*
he
said
,
no
,
truly
;
it
had
finally
departed
from
that
quarter
on
that
*NL*
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
my
darling
girl
is
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
The
sorrow
that
*NL*
has
been
in
her
face
--
for
it
is
not
there
now
--
seems
to
have
purified
*NL*
even
its
innocent
expression
and
to
have
given
it
a
diviner
quality
.
*NL*
Sometimes
when
I
raise
my
eyes
and
see
her
in
the
black
dress
that
*NL*
she
still
wears
,
teaching
my
Richard
,
I
feel
--
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
express
--
as
if
it
were
so
good
to
know
that
she
remembers
her
dear
*NL*
Esther
in
her
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
call
him
my
Richard
!
But
he
says
that
he
has
two
mamas
,
and
I
am
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
not
rich
in
the
bank
,
but
we
have
always
prospered
,
and
we
*NL*
have
quite
enough
.
I
never
walk
out
with
my
husband
but
I
hear
the
*NL*
people
bless
him
.
I
never
go
into
a
house
of
any
degree
but
I
hear
*NL*
his
praises
or
see
them
in
grateful
eyes
.
I
never
lie
down
at
night
*NL*
but
I
know
that
in
the
course
of
that
day
he
has
alleviated
pain
and
*NL*
soothed
some
fellow-creature
in
the
time
of
need
.
I
know
that
from
*NL*
the
beds
of
those
who
were
past
recovery
,
thanks
have
often
,
often
*NL*
gone
up
,
in
the
last
hour
,
for
his
patient
ministration
.
Is
not
this
*NL*
to
be
rich
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
even
praise
me
as
the
doctor
's
wife
.
The
people
even
like
*NL*
me
as
I
go
about
,
and
make
so
much
of
me
that
I
am
quite
abashed
.
I
*NL*
owe
it
all
to
him
,
my
love
,
my
pride
!
They
like
me
for
his
sake
,
as
I
*NL*
do
everything
I
do
in
life
for
his
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
night
or
two
ago
,
after
bustling
about
preparing
for
my
darling
and
*NL*
my
guardian
and
little
Richard
,
who
are
coming
to-morrow
,
I
was
*NL*
sitting
out
in
the
porch
of
all
places
,
that
dearly
memorable
porch
,
*NL*
when
Allan
came
home
.
So
he
said
,
``
My
precious
little
woman
,
what
are
*NL*
you
doing
here
?
''
And
I
said
,
``
The
moon
is
shining
so
brightly
,
Allan
,
*NL*
and
the
night
is
so
delicious
,
that
I
have
been
sitting
here
*NL*
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
thinking
about
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Allan
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
curious
you
are
!
''
said
I.
``
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
,
but
*NL*
I
will
.
I
have
been
thinking
about
my
old
looks
--
such
as
they
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
you
been
thinking
about
THEM
,
my
busy
bee
?
''
said
*NL*
Allan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
that
I
thought
it
was
impossible
that
you
COULD
*NL*
have
loved
me
any
better
,
even
if
I
had
retained
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Such
as
they
were
'
?
''
said
Allan
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
as
they
were
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dame
Durden
,
''
said
Allan
,
drawing
my
arm
through
his
,
``
do
*NL*
you
ever
look
in
the
glass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
do
;
you
see
me
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
know
that
you
are
prettier
than
you
ever
were
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
that
;
I
am
not
certain
that
I
know
it
now
.
But
I
know
*NL*
that
my
dearest
little
pets
are
very
pretty
,
and
that
my
darling
is
*NL*
very
beautiful
,
and
that
my
husband
is
very
handsome
,
and
that
my
*NL*
guardian
has
the
brightest
and
most
benevolent
face
that
ever
was
*NL*
seen
,
and
that
they
can
very
well
do
without
much
beauty
in
me
--
even
*NL*
supposing
--
.
