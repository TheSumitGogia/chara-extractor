*NL*
Chapter
One
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
in
class
when
the
head-master
came
in
,
followed
by
a
``
new
*NL*
fellow
,
''
not
wearing
the
school
uniform
,
and
a
school
servant
carrying
a
*NL*
large
desk
.
Those
who
had
been
asleep
woke
up
,
and
every
one
rose
as
if
*NL*
just
surprised
at
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head-master
made
a
sign
to
us
to
sit
down
.
Then
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
class-master
,
he
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Roger
,
here
is
a
pupil
whom
I
recommend
to
your
care
;
he
'll
be
*NL*
in
the
second
.
If
his
work
and
conduct
are
satisfactory
,
he
will
go
into
*NL*
one
of
the
upper
classes
,
as
becomes
his
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
new
fellow
,
''
standing
in
the
corner
behind
the
door
so
that
he
*NL*
could
hardly
be
seen
,
was
a
country
lad
of
about
fifteen
,
and
taller
*NL*
than
any
of
us
.
His
hair
was
cut
square
on
his
forehead
like
a
village
*NL*
chorister
's
;
he
looked
reliable
,
but
very
ill
at
ease
.
Although
he
was
*NL*
not
broad-shouldered
,
his
short
school
jacket
of
green
cloth
with
black
*NL*
buttons
must
have
been
tight
about
the
arm-holes
,
and
showed
at
the
*NL*
opening
of
the
cuffs
red
wrists
accustomed
to
being
bare
.
His
legs
,
in
*NL*
blue
stockings
,
looked
out
from
beneath
yellow
trousers
,
drawn
tight
by
*NL*
braces
,
He
wore
stout
,
ill-cleaned
,
hob-nailed
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
began
repeating
the
lesson
.
He
listened
with
all
his
ears
,
as
*NL*
attentive
as
if
at
a
sermon
,
not
daring
even
to
cross
his
legs
or
lean
*NL*
on
his
elbow
;
and
when
at
two
o'clock
the
bell
rang
,
the
master
was
*NL*
obliged
to
tell
him
to
fall
into
line
with
the
rest
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
back
to
work
,
we
were
in
the
habit
of
throwing
our
caps
on
*NL*
the
ground
so
as
to
have
our
hands
more
free
;
we
used
from
the
door
to
*NL*
toss
them
under
the
form
,
so
that
they
hit
against
the
wall
and
made
a
*NL*
lot
of
dust
:
it
was
``
the
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
whether
he
had
not
noticed
the
trick
,
or
did
not
dare
to
attempt
*NL*
it
,
the
``
new
fellow
,
''
was
still
holding
his
cap
on
his
knees
even
after
*NL*
prayers
were
over
.
It
was
one
of
those
head-gears
of
composite
order
,
in
*NL*
which
we
can
find
traces
of
the
bearskin
,
shako
,
billycock
hat
,
sealskin
*NL*
cap
,
and
cotton
night-cap
;
one
of
those
poor
things
,
in
fine
,
whose
*NL*
dumb
ugliness
has
depths
of
expression
,
like
an
imbecile
's
face
.
Oval
,
*NL*
stiffened
with
whalebone
,
it
began
with
three
round
knobs
;
then
came
in
*NL*
succession
lozenges
of
velvet
and
rabbit-skin
separated
by
a
red
band
;
*NL*
after
that
a
sort
of
bag
that
ended
in
a
cardboard
polygon
covered
with
*NL*
complicated
braiding
,
from
which
hung
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
thin
cord
,
*NL*
small
twisted
gold
threads
in
the
manner
of
a
tassel
.
The
cap
was
new
;
*NL*
its
peak
shone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rise
,
''
said
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
;
his
cap
fell
.
The
whole
class
began
to
laugh
.
He
stooped
to
*NL*
pick
it
up
.
A
neighbor
knocked
it
down
again
with
his
elbow
;
he
picked
*NL*
it
up
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
rid
of
your
helmet
,
''
said
the
master
,
who
was
a
bit
of
a
wag
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
boys
,
which
so
thoroughly
put
the
*NL*
poor
lad
out
of
countenance
that
he
did
not
know
whether
to
keep
his
cap
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
leave
it
on
the
ground
,
or
put
it
on
his
head
.
He
sat
down
*NL*
again
and
placed
it
on
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rise
,
''
repeated
the
master
,
``
and
tell
me
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
boy
articulated
in
a
stammering
voice
an
unintelligible
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
sputtering
of
syllables
was
heard
,
drowned
by
the
tittering
of
*NL*
the
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louder
!
''
cried
the
master
;
``
louder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
new
fellow
''
then
took
a
supreme
resolution
,
opened
an
inordinately
*NL*
large
mouth
,
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
if
calling
someone
*NL*
in
the
word
``
Charbovari
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
hubbub
broke
out
,
rose
in
crescendo
with
bursts
of
shrill
voices
-LRB-
they
*NL*
yelled
,
barked
,
stamped
,
repeated
``
Charbovari
!
Charbovari
''
-RRB-
,
then
died
*NL*
away
into
single
notes
,
growing
quieter
only
with
great
difficulty
,
and
*NL*
now
and
again
suddenly
recommencing
along
the
line
of
a
form
whence
rose
*NL*
here
and
there
,
like
a
damp
cracker
going
off
,
a
stifled
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
amid
a
rain
of
impositions
,
order
was
gradually
re-established
*NL*
in
the
class
;
and
the
master
having
succeeded
in
catching
the
name
of
*NL*
``
Charles
Bovary
,
''
having
had
it
dictated
to
him
,
spelt
out
,
and
re-read
,
*NL*
at
once
ordered
the
poor
devil
to
go
and
sit
down
on
the
punishment
form
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
master
's
desk
.
He
got
up
,
but
before
going
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
looking
for
?
''
asked
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
c-a-p
,
''
timidly
said
the
``
new
fellow
,
''
casting
troubled
looks
round
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
hundred
lines
for
all
the
class
!
''
shouted
in
a
furious
voice
*NL*
stopped
,
like
the
Quos
ego
*
,
a
fresh
outburst
.
``
Silence
!
''
continued
the
*NL*
master
indignantly
,
wiping
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
,
which
he
*NL*
had
just
taken
from
his
cap
.
``
As
to
you
,
`
new
boy
,
'
you
will
conjugate
*NL*
`
ridiculus
sum
'
**
twenty
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
in
a
gentler
tone
,
``
Come
,
you
'll
find
your
cap
again
;
it
has
n't
*NL*
been
stolen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
quotation
from
the
Aeneid
signifying
a
threat
.
*NL*
*NL*
**
I
am
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quiet
was
restored
.
Heads
bent
over
desks
,
and
the
``
new
fellow
''
remained
*NL*
for
two
hours
in
an
exemplary
attitude
,
although
from
time
to
time
some
*NL*
paper
pellet
flipped
from
the
tip
of
a
pen
came
bang
in
his
face
.
But
he
*NL*
wiped
his
face
with
one
hand
and
continued
motionless
,
his
eyes
lowered
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
at
preparation
,
he
pulled
out
his
pens
from
his
desk
,
*NL*
arranged
his
small
belongings
,
and
carefully
ruled
his
paper
.
We
saw
him
*NL*
working
conscientiously
,
looking
up
every
word
in
the
dictionary
,
and
*NL*
taking
the
greatest
pains
.
Thanks
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
willingness
he
*NL*
showed
,
he
had
not
to
go
down
to
the
class
below
.
But
though
he
knew
his
*NL*
rules
passably
,
he
had
little
finish
in
composition
.
It
was
the
cure
*NL*
of
his
village
who
had
taught
him
his
first
Latin
;
his
parents
,
from
*NL*
motives
of
economy
,
having
sent
him
to
school
as
late
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
,
Monsieur
Charles
Denis
Bartolome
Bovary
,
retired
*NL*
assistant-surgeon-major
,
compromised
about
1812
in
certain
conscription
*NL*
scandals
,
and
forced
at
this
time
to
leave
the
service
,
had
taken
*NL*
advantage
of
his
fine
figure
to
get
hold
of
a
dowry
of
sixty
thousand
*NL*
francs
that
offered
in
the
person
of
a
hosier
's
daughter
who
had
fallen
*NL*
in
love
with
his
good
looks
.
A
fine
man
,
a
great
talker
,
making
his
*NL*
spurs
ring
as
he
walked
,
wearing
whiskers
that
ran
into
his
moustache
,
*NL*
his
fingers
always
garnished
with
rings
and
dressed
in
loud
colours
,
*NL*
he
had
the
dash
of
a
military
man
with
the
easy
go
of
a
commercial
*NL*
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
married
,
he
lived
for
three
or
four
years
on
his
wife
's
fortune
,
*NL*
dining
well
,
rising
late
,
smoking
long
porcelain
pipes
,
not
coming
in
*NL*
at
night
till
after
the
theatre
,
and
haunting
cafes
.
The
father-in-law
*NL*
died
,
leaving
little
;
he
was
indignant
at
this
,
``
went
in
for
the
*NL*
business
,
''
lost
some
money
in
it
,
then
retired
to
the
country
,
where
he
*NL*
thought
he
would
make
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
he
knew
no
more
about
farming
than
calico
,
as
he
rode
his
horses
*NL*
instead
of
sending
them
to
plough
,
drank
his
cider
in
bottle
instead
of
*NL*
selling
it
in
cask
,
ate
the
finest
poultry
in
his
farmyard
,
and
greased
*NL*
his
hunting-boots
with
the
fat
of
his
pigs
,
he
was
not
long
in
finding
*NL*
out
that
he
would
do
better
to
give
up
all
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
hundred
francs
a
year
he
managed
to
live
on
the
border
of
*NL*
the
provinces
of
Caux
and
Picardy
,
in
a
kind
of
place
half
farm
,
half
*NL*
private
house
;
and
here
,
soured
,
eaten
up
with
regrets
,
cursing
his
*NL*
luck
,
jealous
of
everyone
,
he
shut
himself
up
at
the
age
of
forty-five
,
*NL*
sick
of
men
,
he
said
,
and
determined
to
live
at
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
had
adored
him
once
on
a
time
;
she
had
bored
him
with
a
*NL*
thousand
servilities
that
had
only
estranged
him
the
more
.
Lively
once
,
*NL*
expansive
and
affectionate
,
in
growing
older
she
had
become
-LRB-
after
the
*NL*
fashion
of
wine
that
,
exposed
to
air
,
turns
to
vinegar
-RRB-
ill-tempered
,
*NL*
grumbling
,
irritable
.
She
had
suffered
so
much
without
complaint
at
*NL*
first
,
until
she
had
seem
him
going
after
all
the
village
drabs
,
and
*NL*
until
a
score
of
bad
houses
sent
him
back
to
her
at
night
,
weary
,
*NL*
stinking
drunk
.
Then
her
pride
revolted
.
After
that
she
was
silent
,
*NL*
burying
her
anger
in
a
dumb
stoicism
that
she
maintained
till
her
death
.
*NL*
She
was
constantly
going
about
looking
after
business
matters
.
She
*NL*
called
on
the
lawyers
,
the
president
,
remembered
when
bills
fell
due
,
*NL*
got
them
renewed
,
and
at
home
ironed
,
sewed
,
washed
,
looked
after
the
*NL*
workmen
,
paid
the
accounts
,
while
he
,
troubling
himself
about
nothing
,
*NL*
eternally
besotted
in
sleepy
sulkiness
,
whence
he
only
roused
himself
*NL*
to
say
disagreeable
things
to
her
,
sat
smoking
by
the
fire
and
spitting
*NL*
into
the
cinders
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
a
child
,
it
had
to
be
sent
out
to
nurse
.
When
he
came
home
,
*NL*
the
lad
was
spoilt
as
if
he
were
a
prince
.
His
mother
stuffed
him
*NL*
with
jam
;
his
father
let
him
run
about
barefoot
,
and
,
playing
the
*NL*
philosopher
,
even
said
he
might
as
well
go
about
quite
naked
like
the
*NL*
young
of
animals
.
As
opposed
to
the
maternal
ideas
,
he
had
a
certain
*NL*
virile
idea
of
childhood
on
which
he
sought
to
mould
his
son
,
wishing
*NL*
him
to
be
brought
up
hardily
,
like
a
Spartan
,
to
give
him
a
strong
*NL*
constitution
.
He
sent
him
to
bed
without
any
fire
,
taught
him
to
drink
*NL*
off
large
draughts
of
rum
and
to
jeer
at
religious
processions
.
But
,
*NL*
peaceable
by
nature
,
the
lad
answered
only
poorly
to
his
notions
.
His
*NL*
mother
always
kept
him
near
her
;
she
cut
out
cardboard
for
him
,
told
him
*NL*
tales
,
entertained
him
with
endless
monologues
full
of
melancholy
gaiety
*NL*
and
charming
nonsense
.
In
her
life
's
isolation
she
centered
on
the
*NL*
child
's
head
all
her
shattered
,
broken
little
vanities
.
She
dreamed
of
*NL*
high
station
;
she
already
saw
him
,
tall
,
handsome
,
clever
,
settled
as
*NL*
an
engineer
or
in
the
law
.
She
taught
him
to
read
,
and
even
,
on
an
old
*NL*
piano
,
she
had
taught
him
two
or
three
little
songs
.
But
to
all
this
*NL*
Monsieur
Bovary
,
caring
little
for
letters
,
said
,
``
It
was
not
worth
*NL*
while
.
Would
they
ever
have
the
means
to
send
him
to
a
public
school
,
to
*NL*
buy
him
a
practice
,
or
start
him
in
business
?
Besides
,
with
cheek
a
man
*NL*
always
gets
on
in
the
world
.
''
Madame
Bovary
bit
her
lips
,
and
the
child
*NL*
knocked
about
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
after
the
labourers
,
drove
away
with
clods
of
earth
the
ravens
*NL*
that
were
flying
about
.
He
ate
blackberries
along
the
hedges
,
minded
the
*NL*
geese
with
a
long
switch
,
went
haymaking
during
harvest
,
ran
about
in
*NL*
the
woods
,
played
hop-scotch
under
the
church
porch
on
rainy
days
,
and
*NL*
at
great
fetes
begged
the
beadle
to
let
him
toll
the
bells
,
that
he
*NL*
might
hang
all
his
weight
on
the
long
rope
and
feel
himself
borne
upward
*NL*
by
it
in
its
swing
.
Meanwhile
he
grew
like
an
oak
;
he
was
strong
on
*NL*
hand
,
fresh
of
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
twelve
years
old
his
mother
had
her
own
way
;
he
began
*NL*
lessons
.
The
cure
took
him
in
hand
;
but
the
lessons
were
so
short
and
*NL*
irregular
that
they
could
not
be
of
much
use
.
They
were
given
at
spare
*NL*
moments
in
the
sacristy
,
standing
up
,
hurriedly
,
between
a
baptism
and
*NL*
a
burial
;
or
else
the
cure
,
if
he
had
not
to
go
out
,
sent
for
his
pupil
*NL*
after
the
Angelus
*
.
They
went
up
to
his
room
and
settled
down
;
the
*NL*
flies
and
moths
fluttered
round
the
candle
.
It
was
close
,
the
child
*NL*
fell
asleep
,
and
the
good
man
,
beginning
to
doze
with
his
hands
on
his
*NL*
stomach
,
was
soon
snoring
with
his
mouth
wide
open
.
On
other
occasions
,
*NL*
when
Monsieur
le
Cure
,
on
his
way
back
after
administering
the
viaticum
*NL*
to
some
sick
person
in
the
neighbourhood
,
caught
sight
of
Charles
*NL*
playing
about
the
fields
,
he
called
him
,
lectured
him
for
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
and
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
make
him
conjugate
his
*NL*
verb
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
.
The
rain
interrupted
them
or
an
acquaintance
*NL*
passed
.
All
the
same
he
was
always
pleased
with
him
,
and
even
said
the
*NL*
``
young
man
''
had
a
very
good
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
devotion
said
at
morning
,
noon
,
and
evening
,
at
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
bell
.
Here
,
the
evening
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
could
not
go
on
like
this
.
Madame
Bovary
took
strong
steps
.
*NL*
Ashamed
,
or
rather
tired
out
,
Monsieur
Bovary
gave
in
without
a
*NL*
struggle
,
and
they
waited
one
year
longer
,
so
that
the
lad
should
take
*NL*
his
first
communion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
months
more
passed
,
and
the
year
after
Charles
was
finally
sent
to
*NL*
school
at
Rouen
,
where
his
father
took
him
towards
the
end
of
October
,
*NL*
at
the
time
of
the
St.
Romain
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
now
be
impossible
for
any
of
us
to
remember
anything
about
him
.
*NL*
He
was
a
youth
of
even
temperament
,
who
played
in
playtime
,
worked
in
*NL*
school-hours
,
was
attentive
in
class
,
slept
well
in
the
dormitory
,
*NL*
and
ate
well
in
the
refectory
.
He
had
in
loco
parentis
*
a
wholesale
*NL*
ironmonger
in
the
Rue
Ganterie
,
who
took
him
out
once
a
month
on
Sundays
*NL*
after
his
shop
was
shut
,
sent
him
for
a
walk
on
the
quay
to
look
at
*NL*
the
boats
,
and
then
brought
him
back
to
college
at
seven
o'clock
before
*NL*
supper
.
Every
Thursday
evening
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
mother
with
*NL*
red
ink
and
three
wafers
;
then
he
went
over
his
history
note-books
,
or
*NL*
read
an
old
volume
of
``
Anarchasis
''
that
was
knocking
about
the
study
.
*NL*
When
he
went
for
walks
he
talked
to
the
servant
,
who
,
like
himself
,
came
*NL*
from
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
In
place
of
a
parent
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
hard
work
he
kept
always
about
the
middle
of
the
class
;
once
*NL*
even
he
got
a
certificate
in
natural
history
.
But
at
the
end
of
his
*NL*
third
year
his
parents
withdrew
him
from
the
school
to
make
him
study
*NL*
medicine
,
convinced
that
he
could
even
take
his
degree
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
chose
a
room
for
him
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
dyer
's
she
*NL*
knew
,
overlooking
the
Eau-de-Robec
.
She
made
arrangements
for
his
*NL*
board
,
got
him
furniture
,
table
and
two
chairs
,
sent
home
for
an
old
*NL*
cherry-tree
bedstead
,
and
bought
besides
a
small
cast-iron
stove
with
*NL*
the
supply
of
wood
that
was
to
warm
the
poor
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
departed
,
after
a
thousand
injunctions
to
*NL*
be
good
now
that
he
was
going
to
be
left
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
syllabus
that
he
read
on
the
notice-board
stunned
him
;
lectures
*NL*
on
anatomy
,
lectures
on
pathology
,
lectures
on
physiology
,
lectures
on
*NL*
pharmacy
,
lectures
on
botany
and
clinical
medicine
,
and
therapeutics
,
*NL*
without
counting
hygiene
and
materia
medica
--
all
names
of
whose
*NL*
etymologies
he
was
ignorant
,
and
that
were
to
him
as
so
many
doors
to
*NL*
sanctuaries
filled
with
magnificent
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
understood
nothing
of
it
all
;
it
was
all
very
well
to
listen
--
he
did
*NL*
not
follow
.
Still
he
worked
;
he
had
bound
note-books
,
he
attended
all
*NL*
the
courses
,
never
missed
a
single
lecture
.
He
did
his
little
daily
task
*NL*
like
a
mill-horse
,
who
goes
round
and
round
with
his
eyes
bandaged
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
work
he
is
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
spare
him
expense
his
mother
sent
him
every
week
by
the
carrier
a
*NL*
piece
of
veal
baked
in
the
oven
,
with
which
he
lunched
when
he
came
back
*NL*
from
the
hospital
,
while
he
sat
kicking
his
feet
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
After
this
he
had
to
run
off
to
lectures
,
to
the
operation-room
,
to
the
*NL*
hospital
,
and
return
to
his
home
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
,
after
the
poor
dinner
of
his
landlord
,
he
went
back
to
his
*NL*
room
and
set
to
work
again
in
his
wet
clothes
,
which
smoked
as
he
sat
in
*NL*
front
of
the
hot
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fine
summer
evenings
,
at
the
time
when
the
close
streets
are
*NL*
empty
,
when
the
servants
are
playing
shuttle-cock
at
the
doors
,
he
*NL*
opened
his
window
and
leaned
out
.
The
river
,
that
makes
of
this
quarter
*NL*
of
Rouen
a
wretched
little
Venice
,
flowed
beneath
him
,
between
the
*NL*
bridges
and
the
railings
,
yellow
,
violet
,
or
blue
.
Working
men
,
kneeling
*NL*
on
the
banks
,
washed
their
bare
arms
in
the
water
.
On
poles
projecting
*NL*
from
the
attics
,
skeins
of
cotton
were
drying
in
the
air
.
Opposite
,
*NL*
beyond
the
roots
spread
the
pure
heaven
with
the
red
sun
setting
.
How
*NL*
pleasant
it
must
be
at
home
!
How
fresh
under
the
beech-tree
!
And
he
*NL*
expanded
his
nostrils
to
breathe
in
the
sweet
odours
of
the
country
*NL*
which
did
not
reach
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
thin
,
his
figure
became
taller
,
his
face
took
a
saddened
look
*NL*
that
made
it
nearly
interesting
.
Naturally
,
through
indifference
,
he
*NL*
abandoned
all
the
resolutions
he
had
made
.
Once
he
missed
a
lecture
;
the
*NL*
next
day
all
the
lectures
;
and
,
enjoying
his
idleness
,
little
by
little
,
*NL*
he
gave
up
work
altogether
.
He
got
into
the
habit
of
going
to
the
*NL*
public-house
,
and
had
a
passion
for
dominoes
.
To
shut
himself
up
every
*NL*
evening
in
the
dirty
public
room
,
to
push
about
on
marble
tables
the
*NL*
small
sheep
bones
with
black
dots
,
seemed
to
him
a
fine
proof
of
his
*NL*
freedom
,
which
raised
him
in
his
own
esteem
.
It
was
beginning
to
see
*NL*
life
,
the
sweetness
of
stolen
pleasures
;
and
when
he
entered
,
he
put
*NL*
his
hand
on
the
door-handle
with
a
joy
almost
sensual
.
Then
many
things
*NL*
hidden
within
him
came
out
;
he
learnt
couplets
by
heart
and
sang
them
to
*NL*
his
boon
companions
,
became
enthusiastic
about
Beranger
,
learnt
how
to
*NL*
make
punch
,
and
,
finally
,
how
to
make
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
these
preparatory
labours
,
he
failed
completely
in
his
*NL*
examination
for
an
ordinary
degree
.
He
was
expected
home
the
same
night
*NL*
to
celebrate
his
success
.
He
started
on
foot
,
stopped
at
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
village
,
sent
for
his
mother
,
and
told
her
all
.
She
excused
*NL*
him
,
threw
the
blame
of
his
failure
on
the
injustice
of
the
examiners
,
*NL*
encouraged
him
a
little
,
and
took
upon
herself
to
set
matters
straight
.
*NL*
It
was
only
five
years
later
that
Monsieur
Bovary
knew
the
truth
;
it
was
*NL*
old
then
,
and
he
accepted
it
.
Moreover
,
he
could
not
believe
that
a
man
*NL*
born
of
him
could
be
a
fool
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Charles
set
to
work
again
and
crammed
for
his
examination
,
*NL*
ceaselessly
learning
all
the
old
questions
by
heart
.
He
passed
pretty
*NL*
well
.
What
a
happy
day
for
his
mother
!
They
gave
a
grand
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
should
he
go
to
practice
?
To
Tostes
,
where
there
was
only
one
old
*NL*
doctor
.
For
a
long
time
Madame
Bovary
had
been
on
the
look-out
for
his
*NL*
death
,
and
the
old
fellow
had
barely
been
packed
off
when
Charles
was
*NL*
installed
,
opposite
his
place
,
as
his
successor
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
everything
to
have
brought
up
a
son
,
to
have
had
him
*NL*
taught
medicine
,
and
discovered
Tostes
,
where
he
could
practice
it
;
*NL*
he
must
have
a
wife
.
She
found
him
one
--
the
widow
of
a
bailiff
at
*NL*
Dieppe
--
who
was
forty-five
and
had
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
.
*NL*
Though
she
was
ugly
,
as
dry
as
a
bone
,
her
face
with
as
many
pimples
as
*NL*
the
spring
has
buds
,
Madame
Dubuc
had
no
lack
of
suitors
.
To
attain
her
*NL*
ends
Madame
Bovary
had
to
oust
them
all
,
and
she
even
succeeded
in
*NL*
very
cleverly
baffling
the
intrigues
of
a
port-butcher
backed
up
by
the
*NL*
priests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
had
seen
in
marriage
the
advent
of
an
easier
life
,
thinking
he
*NL*
would
be
more
free
to
do
as
he
liked
with
himself
and
his
money
.
But
his
*NL*
wife
was
master
;
he
had
to
say
this
and
not
say
that
in
company
,
to
fast
*NL*
every
Friday
,
dress
as
she
liked
,
harass
at
her
bidding
those
patients
*NL*
who
did
not
pay
.
She
opened
his
letter
,
watched
his
comings
and
goings
,
*NL*
and
listened
at
the
partition-wall
when
women
came
to
consult
him
in
his
*NL*
surgery
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
have
her
chocolate
every
morning
,
attentions
without
end
.
She
*NL*
constantly
complained
of
her
nerves
,
her
chest
,
her
liver
.
The
noise
of
*NL*
footsteps
made
her
ill
;
when
people
left
her
,
solitude
became
odious
to
*NL*
her
;
if
they
came
back
,
it
was
doubtless
to
see
her
die
.
When
Charles
*NL*
returned
in
the
evening
,
she
stretched
forth
two
long
thin
arms
from
*NL*
beneath
the
sheets
,
put
them
round
his
neck
,
and
having
made
him
sit
*NL*
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
began
to
talk
to
him
of
her
troubles
:
he
*NL*
was
neglecting
her
,
he
loved
another
.
She
had
been
warned
she
would
be
*NL*
unhappy
;
and
she
ended
by
asking
him
for
a
dose
of
medicine
and
a
little
*NL*
more
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Two
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
towards
eleven
o'clock
they
were
awakened
by
the
noise
of
*NL*
a
horse
pulling
up
outside
their
door
.
The
servant
opened
the
*NL*
garret-window
and
parleyed
for
some
time
with
a
man
in
the
street
below
.
*NL*
He
came
for
the
doctor
,
had
a
letter
for
him
.
Natasie
came
downstairs
*NL*
shivering
and
undid
the
bars
and
bolts
one
after
the
other
.
The
man
left
*NL*
his
horse
,
and
,
following
the
servant
,
suddenly
came
in
behind
her
.
He
*NL*
pulled
out
from
his
wool
cap
with
grey
top-knots
a
letter
wrapped
up
in
*NL*
a
rag
and
presented
it
gingerly
to
Charles
,
who
rested
on
his
elbow
on
*NL*
the
pillow
to
read
it
.
Natasie
,
standing
near
the
bed
,
held
the
light
.
*NL*
Madame
in
modesty
had
turned
to
the
wall
and
showed
only
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
,
sealed
with
a
small
seal
in
blue
wax
,
begged
Monsieur
*NL*
Bovary
to
come
immediately
to
the
farm
of
the
Bertaux
to
set
a
broken
*NL*
leg
.
Now
from
Tostes
to
the
Bertaux
was
a
good
eighteen
miles
across
*NL*
country
by
way
of
Longueville
and
Saint-Victor
.
It
was
a
dark
night
;
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
junior
was
afraid
of
accidents
for
her
husband
.
So
it
was
*NL*
decided
the
stable-boy
should
go
on
first
;
Charles
would
start
three
*NL*
hours
later
when
the
moon
rose
.
A
boy
was
to
be
sent
to
meet
him
,
and
*NL*
show
him
the
way
to
the
farm
,
and
open
the
gates
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
Charles
,
well
wrapped
up
in
his
*NL*
cloak
,
set
out
for
the
Bertaux
.
Still
sleepy
from
the
warmth
of
his
bed
,
*NL*
he
let
himself
be
lulled
by
the
quiet
trot
of
his
horse
.
When
it
stopped
*NL*
of
its
own
accord
in
front
of
those
holes
surrounded
with
thorns
that
*NL*
are
dug
on
the
margin
of
furrows
,
Charles
awoke
with
a
start
,
suddenly
*NL*
remembered
the
broken
leg
,
and
tried
to
call
to
mind
all
the
fractures
*NL*
he
knew
.
The
rain
had
stopped
,
day
was
breaking
,
and
on
the
branches
*NL*
of
the
leafless
trees
birds
roosted
motionless
,
their
little
feathers
*NL*
bristling
in
the
cold
morning
wind
.
The
flat
country
stretched
as
far
as
*NL*
eye
could
see
,
and
the
tufts
of
trees
round
the
farms
at
long
intervals
*NL*
seemed
like
dark
violet
stains
on
the
cast
grey
surface
,
that
on
the
*NL*
horizon
faded
into
the
gloom
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
from
time
to
time
opened
his
eyes
,
his
mind
grew
weary
,
and
,
*NL*
sleep
coming
upon
him
,
he
soon
fell
into
a
doze
wherein
,
his
recent
*NL*
sensations
blending
with
memories
,
he
became
conscious
of
a
double
*NL*
self
,
at
once
student
and
married
man
,
lying
in
his
bed
as
but
now
,
and
*NL*
crossing
the
operation
theatre
as
of
old
.
The
warm
smell
of
poultices
*NL*
mingled
in
his
brain
with
the
fresh
odour
of
dew
;
he
heard
the
iron
*NL*
rings
rattling
along
the
curtain-rods
of
the
bed
and
saw
his
wife
*NL*
sleeping
.
As
he
passed
Vassonville
he
came
upon
a
boy
sitting
on
the
*NL*
grass
at
the
edge
of
a
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
doctor
?
''
asked
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
Charles
's
answer
he
took
his
wooden
shoes
in
his
hands
and
ran
on
*NL*
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
practitioner
,
riding
along
,
gathered
from
his
guide
's
talk
*NL*
that
Monsieur
Rouault
must
be
one
of
the
well-to-do
farmers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
broken
his
leg
the
evening
before
on
his
way
home
from
a
*NL*
Twelfth-night
feast
at
a
neighbour
's
.
His
wife
had
been
dead
for
two
*NL*
years
.
There
was
with
him
only
his
daughter
,
who
helped
him
to
keep
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ruts
were
becoming
deeper
;
they
were
approaching
the
Bertaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
lad
,
slipping
through
a
hole
in
the
hedge
,
disappeared
;
*NL*
then
he
came
back
to
the
end
of
a
courtyard
to
open
the
gate
.
The
*NL*
horse
slipped
on
the
wet
grass
;
Charles
had
to
stoop
to
pass
under
*NL*
the
branches
.
The
watchdogs
in
their
kennels
barked
,
dragging
at
their
*NL*
chains
.
As
he
entered
the
Bertaux
,
the
horse
took
fright
and
stumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
substantial-looking
farm
.
In
the
stables
,
over
the
top
of
the
*NL*
open
doors
,
one
could
see
great
cart-horses
quietly
feeding
from
new
*NL*
racks
.
Right
along
the
outbuildings
extended
a
large
dunghill
,
from
*NL*
which
manure
liquid
oozed
,
while
amidst
fowls
and
turkeys
,
five
or
six
*NL*
peacocks
,
a
luxury
in
Chauchois
farmyards
,
were
foraging
on
the
top
of
*NL*
it
.
The
sheepfold
was
long
,
the
barn
high
,
with
walls
smooth
as
your
*NL*
hand
.
Under
the
cart-shed
were
two
large
carts
and
four
ploughs
,
with
*NL*
their
whips
,
shafts
and
harnesses
complete
,
whose
fleeces
of
blue
wool
*NL*
were
getting
soiled
by
the
fine
dust
that
fell
from
the
granaries
.
The
*NL*
courtyard
sloped
upwards
,
planted
with
trees
set
out
symmetrically
,
and
*NL*
the
chattering
noise
of
a
flock
of
geese
was
heard
near
the
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
woman
in
a
blue
merino
dress
with
three
flounces
came
to
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
door
to
receive
Monsieur
Bovary
,
whom
she
led
to
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
where
a
large
fire
was
blazing
.
The
servant
's
breakfast
was
*NL*
boiling
beside
it
in
small
pots
of
all
sizes
.
Some
damp
clothes
were
*NL*
drying
inside
the
chimney-corner
.
The
shovel
,
tongs
,
and
the
nozzle
*NL*
of
the
bellows
,
all
of
colossal
size
,
shone
like
polished
steel
,
while
*NL*
along
the
walls
hung
many
pots
and
pans
in
which
the
clear
flame
of
the
*NL*
hearth
,
mingling
with
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
coming
in
through
the
*NL*
window
,
was
mirrored
fitfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
went
up
the
first
floor
to
see
the
patient
.
He
found
him
in
his
*NL*
bed
,
sweating
under
his
bed-clothes
,
having
thrown
his
cotton
nightcap
*NL*
right
away
from
him
.
He
was
a
fat
little
man
of
fifty
,
with
white
skin
*NL*
and
blue
eyes
,
the
forepart
of
his
head
bald
,
and
he
wore
earrings
.
By
*NL*
his
side
on
a
chair
stood
a
large
decanter
of
brandy
,
whence
he
poured
*NL*
himself
a
little
from
time
to
time
to
keep
up
his
spirits
;
but
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
doctor
his
elation
subsided
,
and
instead
of
*NL*
swearing
,
as
he
had
been
doing
for
the
last
twelve
hours
,
began
to
groan
*NL*
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fracture
was
a
simple
one
,
without
any
kind
of
complication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
could
not
have
hoped
for
an
easier
case
.
Then
calling
to
mind
*NL*
the
devices
of
his
masters
at
the
bedsides
of
patients
,
he
comforted
the
*NL*
sufferer
with
all
sorts
of
kindly
remarks
,
those
caresses
of
the
surgeon
*NL*
that
are
like
the
oil
they
put
on
bistouries
.
In
order
to
make
some
*NL*
splints
a
bundle
of
laths
was
brought
up
from
the
cart-house
.
Charles
*NL*
selected
one
,
cut
it
into
two
pieces
and
planed
it
with
a
fragment
*NL*
of
windowpane
,
while
the
servant
tore
up
sheets
to
make
bandages
,
and
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Emma
tried
to
sew
some
pads
.
As
she
was
a
long
time
before
*NL*
she
found
her
work-case
,
her
father
grew
impatient
;
she
did
not
answer
,
*NL*
but
as
she
sewed
she
pricked
her
fingers
,
which
she
then
put
to
her
*NL*
mouth
to
suck
them
.
Charles
was
surprised
at
the
whiteness
of
her
nails
.
*NL*
They
were
shiny
,
delicate
at
the
tips
,
more
polished
than
the
ivory
of
*NL*
Dieppe
,
and
almond-shaped
.
Yet
her
hand
was
not
beautiful
,
perhaps
not
*NL*
white
enough
,
and
a
little
hard
at
the
knuckles
;
besides
,
it
was
too
*NL*
long
,
with
no
soft
inflections
in
the
outlines
.
Her
real
beauty
was
in
*NL*
her
eyes
.
Although
brown
,
they
seemed
black
because
of
the
lashes
,
and
*NL*
her
look
came
at
you
frankly
,
with
a
candid
boldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bandaging
over
,
the
doctor
was
invited
by
Monsieur
Rouault
himself
*NL*
to
``
pick
a
bit
''
before
he
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
went
down
into
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
.
Knives
and
forks
*NL*
and
silver
goblets
were
laid
for
two
on
a
little
table
at
the
foot
of
a
*NL*
huge
bed
that
had
a
canopy
of
printed
cotton
with
figures
representing
*NL*
Turks
.
There
was
an
odour
of
iris-root
and
damp
sheets
that
escaped
*NL*
from
a
large
oak
chest
opposite
the
window
.
On
the
floor
in
corners
were
*NL*
sacks
of
flour
stuck
upright
in
rows
.
These
were
the
overflow
from
*NL*
the
neighbouring
granary
,
to
which
three
stone
steps
led
.
By
way
of
*NL*
decoration
for
the
apartment
,
hanging
to
a
nail
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
wall
,
whose
green
paint
scaled
off
from
the
effects
of
the
saltpetre
,
*NL*
was
a
crayon
head
of
Minerva
in
gold
frame
,
underneath
which
was
written
*NL*
in
Gothic
letters
``
To
dear
Papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
First
they
spoke
of
the
patient
,
then
of
the
weather
,
of
the
great
cold
,
*NL*
of
the
wolves
that
infested
the
fields
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Rouault
did
not
at
all
like
the
country
,
especially
now
*NL*
that
she
had
to
look
after
the
farm
almost
alone
.
As
the
room
was
*NL*
chilly
,
she
shivered
as
she
ate
.
This
showed
something
of
her
full
lips
,
*NL*
that
she
had
a
habit
of
biting
when
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
neck
stood
out
from
a
white
turned-down
collar
.
Her
hair
,
whose
*NL*
two
black
folds
seemed
each
of
a
single
piece
,
so
smooth
were
they
,
was
*NL*
parted
in
the
middle
by
a
delicate
line
that
curved
slightly
with
the
*NL*
curve
of
the
head
;
and
,
just
showing
the
tip
of
the
ear
,
it
was
joined
*NL*
behind
in
a
thick
chignon
,
with
a
wavy
movement
at
the
temples
that
the
*NL*
country
doctor
saw
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
The
upper
part
of
*NL*
her
cheek
was
rose-coloured
.
She
had
,
like
a
man
,
thrust
in
between
two
*NL*
buttons
of
her
bodice
a
tortoise-shell
eyeglass
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Charles
,
after
bidding
farewell
to
old
Rouault
,
returned
to
the
*NL*
room
before
leaving
,
he
found
her
standing
,
her
forehead
against
the
*NL*
window
,
looking
into
the
garden
,
where
the
bean
props
had
been
knocked
*NL*
down
by
the
wind
.
She
turned
round
.
``
Are
you
looking
for
anything
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
whip
,
if
you
please
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
rummaging
on
the
bed
,
behind
the
doors
,
under
the
chairs
.
It
*NL*
had
fallen
to
the
floor
,
between
the
sacks
and
the
wall
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Emma
saw
it
,
and
bent
over
the
flour
sacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
out
of
politeness
made
a
dash
also
,
and
as
he
stretched
out
his
*NL*
arm
,
at
the
same
moment
felt
his
breast
brush
against
the
back
of
the
*NL*
young
girl
bending
beneath
him
.
She
drew
herself
up
,
scarlet
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
him
over
her
shoulder
as
she
handed
him
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
returning
to
the
Bertaux
in
three
days
as
he
had
promised
,
*NL*
he
went
back
the
very
next
day
,
then
regularly
twice
a
week
,
without
*NL*
counting
the
visits
he
paid
now
and
then
as
if
by
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
,
moreover
,
went
well
;
the
patient
progressed
favourably
;
and
*NL*
when
,
at
the
end
of
forty-six
days
,
old
Rouault
was
seen
trying
to
walk
*NL*
alone
in
his
``
den
,
''
Monsieur
Bovary
began
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
man
*NL*
of
great
capacity
.
Old
Rouault
said
that
he
could
not
have
been
cured
*NL*
better
by
the
first
doctor
of
Yvetot
,
or
even
of
Rouen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Charles
,
he
did
not
stop
to
ask
himself
why
it
was
a
pleasure
*NL*
to
him
to
go
to
the
Bertaux
.
Had
he
done
so
,
he
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
*NL*
attributed
his
zeal
to
the
importance
of
the
case
,
or
perhaps
to
the
*NL*
money
he
hoped
to
make
by
it
.
Was
it
for
this
,
however
,
that
his
visits
*NL*
to
the
farm
formed
a
delightful
exception
to
the
meagre
occupations
of
*NL*
his
life
?
On
these
days
he
rose
early
,
set
off
at
a
gallop
,
urging
on
*NL*
his
horse
,
then
got
down
to
wipe
his
boots
in
the
grass
and
put
on
black
*NL*
gloves
before
entering
.
He
liked
going
into
the
courtyard
,
and
noticing
*NL*
the
gate
turn
against
his
shoulder
,
the
cock
crow
on
the
wall
,
the
lads
*NL*
run
to
meet
him
.
He
liked
the
granary
and
the
stables
;
he
liked
old
*NL*
Rouault
,
who
pressed
his
hand
and
called
him
his
saviour
;
he
liked
the
*NL*
small
wooden
shoes
of
Mademoiselle
Emma
on
the
scoured
flags
of
the
*NL*
kitchen
--
her
high
heels
made
her
a
little
taller
;
and
when
she
walked
in
*NL*
front
of
him
,
the
wooden
soles
springing
up
quickly
struck
with
a
sharp
*NL*
sound
against
the
leather
of
her
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
always
accompanied
him
to
the
first
step
of
the
stairs
.
When
his
*NL*
horse
had
not
yet
been
brought
round
she
stayed
there
.
They
had
said
*NL*
``
Good-bye
''
;
there
was
no
more
talking
.
The
open
air
wrapped
her
round
,
*NL*
playing
with
the
soft
down
on
the
back
of
her
neck
,
or
blew
to
and
fro
*NL*
on
her
hips
the
apron-strings
,
that
fluttered
like
streamers
.
Once
,
*NL*
during
a
thaw
the
bark
of
the
trees
in
the
yard
was
oozing
,
the
snow
on
*NL*
the
roofs
of
the
outbuildings
was
melting
;
she
stood
on
the
threshold
,
*NL*
and
went
to
fetch
her
sunshade
and
opened
it
.
The
sunshade
of
silk
of
*NL*
the
colour
of
pigeons
'
breasts
,
through
which
the
sun
shone
,
lighted
*NL*
up
with
shifting
hues
the
white
skin
of
her
face
.
She
smiled
under
the
*NL*
tender
warmth
,
and
drops
of
water
could
be
heard
falling
one
by
one
on
*NL*
the
stretched
silk
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
period
of
Charles
's
visits
to
the
Bertaux
,
Madame
*NL*
Bovary
junior
never
failed
to
inquire
after
the
invalid
,
and
she
had
*NL*
even
chosen
in
the
book
that
she
kept
on
a
system
of
double
entry
a
*NL*
clean
blank
page
for
Monsieur
Rouault
.
But
when
she
heard
he
had
a
*NL*
daughter
,
she
began
to
make
inquiries
,
and
she
learnt
the
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Rouault
,
brought
up
at
the
Ursuline
Convent
,
had
received
what
is
called
*NL*
``
a
good
education
''
;
and
so
knew
dancing
,
geography
,
drawing
,
how
to
*NL*
embroider
and
play
the
piano
.
That
was
the
last
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
for
this
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
that
his
face
beams
when
he
*NL*
goes
to
see
her
,
and
that
he
puts
on
his
new
waistcoat
at
the
risk
of
*NL*
spoiling
it
with
the
rain
.
Ah
!
that
woman
!
That
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
detested
her
instinctively
.
At
first
she
solaced
herself
by
*NL*
allusions
that
Charles
did
not
understand
,
then
by
casual
observations
*NL*
that
he
let
pass
for
fear
of
a
storm
,
finally
by
open
apostrophes
to
*NL*
which
he
knew
not
what
to
answer
.
``
Why
did
he
go
back
to
the
Bertaux
now
*NL*
that
Monsieur
Rouault
was
cured
and
that
these
folks
had
n't
paid
yet
?
*NL*
Ah
!
it
was
because
a
young
lady
was
there
,
some
one
who
know
how
to
*NL*
talk
,
to
embroider
,
to
be
witty
.
That
was
what
he
cared
about
;
he
wanted
*NL*
town
misses
.
''
And
she
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
daughter
of
old
Rouault
a
town
miss
!
Get
out
!
Their
grandfather
was
*NL*
a
shepherd
,
and
they
have
a
cousin
who
was
almost
had
up
at
the
assizes
*NL*
for
a
nasty
blow
in
a
quarrel
.
It
is
not
worth
while
making
such
a
fuss
,
*NL*
or
showing
herself
at
church
on
Sundays
in
a
silk
gown
like
a
countess
.
*NL*
Besides
,
the
poor
old
chap
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
colza
last
year
,
*NL*
would
have
had
much
ado
to
pay
up
his
arrears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
very
weariness
Charles
left
off
going
to
the
Bertaux
.
Heloise
made
*NL*
him
swear
,
his
hand
on
the
prayer-book
,
that
he
would
go
there
no
more
*NL*
after
much
sobbing
and
many
kisses
,
in
a
great
outburst
of
love
.
He
*NL*
obeyed
then
,
but
the
strength
of
his
desire
protested
against
the
*NL*
servility
of
his
conduct
;
and
he
thought
,
with
a
kind
of
naive
*NL*
hypocrisy
,
that
his
interdict
to
see
her
gave
him
a
sort
of
right
to
*NL*
love
her
.
And
then
the
widow
was
thin
;
she
had
long
teeth
;
wore
in
all
*NL*
weathers
a
little
black
shawl
,
the
edge
of
which
hung
down
between
her
*NL*
shoulder-blades
;
her
bony
figure
was
sheathed
in
her
clothes
as
if
they
*NL*
were
a
scabbard
;
they
were
too
short
,
and
displayed
her
ankles
with
the
*NL*
laces
of
her
large
boots
crossed
over
grey
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
's
mother
came
to
see
them
from
time
to
time
,
but
after
a
few
*NL*
days
the
daughter-in-law
seemed
to
put
her
own
edge
on
her
,
and
*NL*
then
,
like
two
knives
,
they
scarified
him
with
their
reflections
and
*NL*
observations
.
It
was
wrong
of
him
to
eat
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
he
always
offer
a
glass
of
something
to
everyone
who
came
?
*NL*
What
obstinacy
not
to
wear
flannels
!
In
the
spring
it
came
about
that
a
*NL*
notary
at
Ingouville
,
the
holder
of
the
widow
Dubuc
's
property
,
one
fine
*NL*
day
went
off
,
taking
with
him
all
the
money
in
his
office
.
Heloise
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
still
possessed
,
besides
a
share
in
a
boat
valued
at
six
*NL*
thousand
francs
,
her
house
in
the
Rue
St.
Francois
;
and
yet
,
with
all
*NL*
this
fortune
that
had
been
so
trumpeted
abroad
,
nothing
,
excepting
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
furniture
and
a
few
clothes
,
had
appeared
in
the
*NL*
household
.
The
matter
had
to
be
gone
into
.
The
house
at
Dieppe
was
found
*NL*
to
be
eaten
up
with
mortgages
to
its
foundations
;
what
she
had
placed
*NL*
with
the
notary
God
only
knew
,
and
her
share
in
the
boat
did
not
exceed
*NL*
one
thousand
crowns
.
She
had
lied
,
the
good
lady
!
In
his
exasperation
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Bovary
the
elder
,
smashing
a
chair
on
the
flags
,
accused
his
*NL*
wife
of
having
caused
misfortune
to
the
son
by
harnessing
him
to
such
*NL*
a
harridan
,
whose
harness
was
n't
worth
her
hide
.
They
came
to
Tostes
.
*NL*
Explanations
followed
.
There
were
scenes
.
Heloise
in
tears
,
throwing
her
*NL*
arms
about
her
husband
,
implored
him
to
defend
her
from
his
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
tried
to
speak
up
for
her
.
They
grew
angry
and
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
``
the
blow
had
struck
home
.
''
A
week
after
,
as
she
was
hanging
up
some
*NL*
washing
in
her
yard
,
she
was
seized
with
a
spitting
of
blood
,
and
*NL*
the
next
day
,
while
Charles
had
his
back
turned
to
her
drawing
the
*NL*
window-curtain
,
she
said
,
``
O
God
!
''
gave
a
sigh
and
fainted
.
She
was
*NL*
dead
!
What
a
surprise
!
When
all
was
over
at
the
cemetery
Charles
went
*NL*
home
.
He
found
no
one
downstairs
;
he
went
up
to
the
first
floor
to
*NL*
their
room
;
saw
her
dress
still
hanging
at
the
foot
of
the
alcove
;
then
,
*NL*
leaning
against
the
writing-table
,
he
stayed
until
the
evening
,
buried
*NL*
in
a
sorrowful
reverie
.
She
had
loved
him
after
all
!

Chapter
Three
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
old
Rouault
brought
Charles
the
money
for
setting
his
*NL*
leg
--
seventy-five
francs
in
forty-sou
pieces
,
and
a
turkey
.
He
had
heard
*NL*
of
his
loss
,
and
consoled
him
as
well
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
it
is
,
''
said
he
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
;
``
I
've
been
*NL*
through
it
.
When
I
lost
my
dear
departed
,
I
went
into
the
fields
to
be
*NL*
quite
alone
.
I
fell
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
;
I
cried
;
I
called
on
God
;
I
*NL*
talked
nonsense
to
Him
.
I
wanted
to
be
like
the
moles
that
I
saw
on
the
*NL*
branches
,
their
insides
swarming
with
worms
,
dead
,
and
an
end
of
it
.
*NL*
And
when
I
thought
that
there
were
others
at
that
very
moment
with
their
*NL*
nice
little
wives
holding
them
in
their
embrace
,
I
struck
great
blows
on
*NL*
the
earth
with
my
stick
.
I
was
pretty
well
mad
with
not
eating
;
the
very
*NL*
idea
of
going
to
a
cafe
disgusted
me
--
you
would
n't
believe
it
.
Well
,
*NL*
quite
softly
,
one
day
following
another
,
a
spring
on
a
winter
,
and
an
*NL*
autumn
after
a
summer
,
this
wore
away
,
piece
by
piece
,
crumb
by
crumb
;
*NL*
it
passed
away
,
it
is
gone
,
I
should
say
it
has
sunk
;
for
something
*NL*
always
remains
at
the
bottom
as
one
would
say
--
a
weight
here
,
at
one
's
*NL*
heart
.
But
since
it
is
the
lot
of
all
of
us
,
one
must
not
give
way
*NL*
altogether
,
and
,
because
others
have
died
,
want
to
die
too
.
You
must
*NL*
pull
yourself
together
,
Monsieur
Bovary
.
It
will
pass
away
.
Come
to
see
*NL*
us
;
my
daughter
thinks
of
you
now
and
again
,
d'ye
know
,
and
she
says
*NL*
you
are
forgetting
her
.
Spring
will
soon
be
here
.
We
'll
have
some
*NL*
rabbit-shooting
in
the
warrens
to
amuse
you
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
followed
his
advice
.
He
went
back
to
the
Bertaux
.
He
found
all
*NL*
as
he
had
left
it
,
that
is
to
say
,
as
it
was
five
months
ago
.
The
pear
*NL*
trees
were
already
in
blossom
,
and
Farmer
Rouault
,
on
his
legs
again
,
*NL*
came
and
went
,
making
the
farm
more
full
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
it
his
duty
to
heap
the
greatest
attention
upon
the
doctor
*NL*
because
of
his
sad
position
,
he
begged
him
not
to
take
his
hat
off
,
*NL*
spoke
to
him
in
an
undertone
as
if
he
had
been
ill
,
and
even
pretended
*NL*
to
be
angry
because
nothing
rather
lighter
had
been
prepared
for
him
*NL*
than
for
the
others
,
such
as
a
little
clotted
cream
or
stewed
pears
.
He
*NL*
told
stories
.
Charles
found
himself
laughing
,
but
the
remembrance
of
his
*NL*
wife
suddenly
coming
back
to
him
depressed
him
.
Coffee
was
brought
in
;
*NL*
he
thought
no
more
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
less
of
her
as
he
grew
accustomed
to
living
alone
.
The
new
*NL*
delight
of
independence
soon
made
his
loneliness
bearable
.
He
could
now
*NL*
change
his
meal-times
,
go
in
or
out
without
explanation
,
and
when
he
was
*NL*
very
tired
stretch
himself
at
full
length
on
his
bed
.
So
he
nursed
and
*NL*
coddled
himself
and
accepted
the
consolations
that
were
offered
him
.
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
the
death
of
his
wife
had
not
served
him
ill
in
his
*NL*
business
,
since
for
a
month
people
had
been
saying
,
``
The
poor
young
*NL*
man
!
what
a
loss
!
''
His
name
had
been
talked
about
,
his
practice
had
*NL*
increased
;
and
moreover
,
he
could
go
to
the
Bertaux
just
as
he
liked
.
*NL*
He
had
an
aimless
hope
,
and
was
vaguely
happy
;
he
thought
himself
better
*NL*
looking
as
he
brushed
his
whiskers
before
the
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
got
there
about
three
o'clock
.
Everybody
was
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
He
went
into
the
kitchen
,
but
did
not
at
once
catch
sight
of
Emma
;
the
*NL*
outside
shutters
were
closed
.
Through
the
chinks
of
the
wood
the
sun
*NL*
sent
across
the
flooring
long
fine
rays
that
were
broken
at
the
corners
*NL*
of
the
furniture
and
trembled
along
the
ceiling
.
Some
flies
on
the
table
*NL*
were
crawling
up
the
glasses
that
had
been
used
,
and
buzzing
as
they
*NL*
drowned
themselves
in
the
dregs
of
the
cider
.
The
daylight
that
came
in
*NL*
by
the
chimney
made
velvet
of
the
soot
at
the
back
of
the
fireplace
,
and
*NL*
touched
with
blue
the
cold
cinders
.
Between
the
window
and
the
hearth
*NL*
Emma
was
sewing
;
she
wore
no
fichu
;
he
could
see
small
drops
of
*NL*
perspiration
on
her
bare
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
fashion
of
country
folks
she
asked
him
to
have
something
to
*NL*
drink
.
He
said
no
;
she
insisted
,
and
at
last
laughingly
offered
to
have
*NL*
a
glass
of
liqueur
with
him
.
So
she
went
to
fetch
a
bottle
of
curacao
*NL*
from
the
cupboard
,
reached
down
two
small
glasses
,
filled
one
to
the
*NL*
brim
,
poured
scarcely
anything
into
the
other
,
and
,
after
having
clinked
*NL*
glasses
,
carried
hers
to
her
mouth
.
As
it
was
almost
empty
she
bent
*NL*
back
to
drink
,
her
head
thrown
back
,
her
lips
pouting
,
her
neck
on
the
*NL*
strain
.
She
laughed
at
getting
none
of
it
,
while
with
the
tip
of
her
*NL*
tongue
passing
between
her
small
teeth
she
licked
drop
by
drop
the
*NL*
bottom
of
her
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
again
and
took
up
her
work
,
a
white
cotton
stocking
she
was
*NL*
darning
.
She
worked
with
her
head
bent
down
;
she
did
not
speak
,
nor
did
*NL*
Charles
.
The
air
coming
in
under
the
door
blew
a
little
dust
over
the
*NL*
flags
;
he
watched
it
drift
along
,
and
heard
nothing
but
the
throbbing
*NL*
in
his
head
and
the
faint
clucking
of
a
hen
that
had
laid
an
egg
in
the
*NL*
yard
.
Emma
from
time
to
time
cooled
her
cheeks
with
the
palms
of
her
*NL*
hands
,
and
cooled
these
again
on
the
knobs
of
the
huge
fire-dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
complained
of
suffering
since
the
beginning
of
the
season
from
*NL*
giddiness
;
she
asked
if
sea-baths
would
do
her
any
good
;
she
began
*NL*
talking
of
her
convent
,
Charles
of
his
school
;
words
came
to
them
.
They
*NL*
went
up
into
her
bedroom
.
She
showed
him
her
old
music-books
,
the
little
*NL*
prizes
she
had
won
,
and
the
oak-leaf
crowns
,
left
at
the
bottom
of
a
*NL*
cupboard
.
She
spoke
to
him
,
too
,
of
her
mother
,
of
the
country
,
and
even
*NL*
showed
him
the
bed
in
the
garden
where
,
on
the
first
Friday
of
every
*NL*
month
,
she
gathered
flowers
to
put
on
her
mother
's
tomb
.
But
the
*NL*
gardener
they
had
never
knew
anything
about
it
;
servants
are
so
stupid
!
*NL*
She
would
have
dearly
liked
,
if
only
for
the
winter
,
to
live
in
town
,
*NL*
although
the
length
of
the
fine
days
made
the
country
perhaps
even
more
*NL*
wearisome
in
the
summer
.
And
,
according
to
what
she
was
saying
,
her
*NL*
voice
was
clear
,
sharp
,
or
,
on
a
sudden
all
languor
,
drawn
out
in
*NL*
modulations
that
ended
almost
in
murmurs
as
she
spoke
to
herself
,
now
*NL*
joyous
,
opening
big
naive
eyes
,
then
with
her
eyelids
half
closed
,
her
*NL*
look
full
of
boredom
,
her
thoughts
wandering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
home
at
night
,
Charles
went
over
her
words
one
by
one
,
trying
to
*NL*
recall
them
,
to
fill
out
their
sense
,
that
he
might
piece
out
the
life
*NL*
she
had
lived
before
he
knew
her
.
But
he
never
saw
her
in
his
thoughts
*NL*
other
than
he
had
seen
her
the
first
time
,
or
as
he
had
just
left
her
.
*NL*
Then
he
asked
himself
what
would
become
of
her
--
if
she
would
be
married
,
*NL*
and
to
whom
!
Alas
!
Old
Rouault
was
rich
,
and
she
!
--
so
beautiful
!
But
*NL*
Emma
's
face
always
rose
before
his
eyes
,
and
a
monotone
,
like
the
*NL*
humming
of
a
top
,
sounded
in
his
ears
,
``
If
you
should
marry
after
*NL*
all
!
If
you
should
marry
!
''
At
night
he
could
not
sleep
;
his
throat
was
*NL*
parched
;
he
was
athirst
.
He
got
up
to
drink
from
the
water-bottle
and
*NL*
opened
the
window
.
The
night
was
covered
with
stars
,
a
warm
wind
blowing
*NL*
in
the
distance
;
the
dogs
were
barking
.
He
turned
his
head
towards
the
*NL*
Bertaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
that
,
after
all
,
he
should
lose
nothing
,
Charles
promised
*NL*
himself
to
ask
her
in
marriage
as
soon
as
occasion
offered
,
but
each
*NL*
time
such
occasion
did
offer
the
fear
of
not
finding
the
right
words
*NL*
sealed
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Rouault
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
be
rid
of
his
daughter
,
who
was
*NL*
of
no
use
to
him
in
the
house
.
In
his
heart
he
excused
her
,
thinking
*NL*
her
too
clever
for
farming
,
a
calling
under
the
ban
of
Heaven
,
since
one
*NL*
never
saw
a
millionaire
in
it
.
Far
from
having
made
a
fortune
by
it
,
*NL*
the
good
man
was
losing
every
year
;
for
if
he
was
good
in
bargaining
,
in
*NL*
which
he
enjoyed
the
dodges
of
the
trade
,
on
the
other
hand
,
agriculture
*NL*
properly
so
called
,
and
the
internal
management
of
the
farm
,
suited
him
*NL*
less
than
most
people
.
He
did
not
willingly
take
his
hands
out
of
his
*NL*
pockets
,
and
did
not
spare
expense
in
all
that
concerned
himself
,
liking
*NL*
to
eat
well
,
to
have
good
fires
,
and
to
sleep
well
.
He
liked
old
cider
,
*NL*
underdone
legs
of
mutton
,
glorias
*
well
beaten
up
.
He
took
his
meals
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
alone
,
opposite
the
fire
,
on
a
little
table
brought
to
him
*NL*
all
ready
laid
as
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
mixture
of
coffee
and
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
therefore
,
he
perceived
that
Charles
's
cheeks
grew
red
if
near
his
*NL*
daughter
,
which
meant
that
he
would
propose
for
her
one
of
these
days
,
*NL*
he
chewed
the
cud
of
the
matter
beforehand
.
He
certainly
thought
him
a
*NL*
little
meagre
,
and
not
quite
the
son-in-law
he
would
have
liked
,
but
he
*NL*
was
said
to
be
well
brought-up
,
economical
,
very
learned
,
and
no
doubt
*NL*
would
not
make
too
many
difficulties
about
the
dowry
.
Now
,
as
old
*NL*
Rouault
would
soon
be
forced
to
sell
twenty-two
acres
of
``
his
property
,
''
*NL*
as
he
owed
a
good
deal
to
the
mason
,
to
the
harness-maker
,
and
as
the
*NL*
shaft
of
the
cider-press
wanted
renewing
,
``
If
he
asks
for
her
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
I
'll
give
her
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
Michaelmas
Charles
went
to
spend
three
days
at
the
Bertaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
had
passed
like
the
others
in
procrastinating
from
hour
to
*NL*
hour
.
Old
Rouault
was
seeing
him
off
;
they
were
walking
along
the
road
*NL*
full
of
ruts
;
they
were
about
to
part
.
This
was
the
time
.
Charles
gave
*NL*
himself
as
far
as
to
the
corner
of
the
hedge
,
and
at
last
,
when
past
*NL*
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Rouault
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
I
should
like
to
say
something
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
.
Charles
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
tell
me
your
story
.
Do
n't
I
know
all
about
it
?
''
said
old
Rouault
,
*NL*
laughing
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Rouault
--
Monsieur
Rouault
,
''
stammered
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
nothing
better
''
,
the
farmer
went
on
.
``
Although
,
no
doubt
,
the
*NL*
little
one
is
of
my
mind
,
still
we
must
ask
her
opinion
.
So
you
get
*NL*
off
--
I
'll
go
back
home
.
If
it
is
`
yes
'
,
you
need
n't
return
because
of
*NL*
all
the
people
about
,
and
besides
it
would
upset
her
too
much
.
But
so
*NL*
that
you
may
n't
be
eating
your
heart
,
I
'll
open
wide
the
outer
shutter
*NL*
of
the
window
against
the
wall
;
you
can
see
it
from
the
back
by
leaning
*NL*
over
the
hedge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
fastened
his
horse
to
a
tree
;
he
ran
into
the
road
and
waited
.
*NL*
Half
an
hour
passed
,
then
he
counted
nineteen
minutes
by
his
watch
.
*NL*
Suddenly
a
noise
was
heard
against
the
wall
;
the
shutter
had
been
thrown
*NL*
back
;
the
hook
was
still
swinging
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
by
nine
o'clock
he
was
at
the
farm
.
Emma
blushed
as
*NL*
he
entered
,
and
she
gave
a
little
forced
laugh
to
keep
herself
in
*NL*
countenance
.
Old
Rouault
embraced
his
future
son-in-law
.
The
discussion
*NL*
of
money
matters
was
put
off
;
moreover
,
there
was
plenty
of
time
before
*NL*
them
,
as
the
marriage
could
not
decently
take
place
till
Charles
was
out
*NL*
of
mourning
,
that
is
to
say
,
about
the
spring
of
the
next
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
passed
waiting
for
this
.
Mademoiselle
Rouault
was
busy
with
*NL*
her
trousseau
.
Part
of
it
was
ordered
at
Rouen
,
and
she
made
herself
*NL*
chemises
and
nightcaps
after
fashion-plates
that
she
borrowed
.
When
*NL*
Charles
visited
the
farmer
,
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
were
talked
*NL*
over
;
they
wondered
in
what
room
they
should
have
dinner
;
they
dreamed
*NL*
of
the
number
of
dishes
that
would
be
wanted
,
and
what
should
be
*NL*
entrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
would
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
preferred
to
have
a
midnight
wedding
*NL*
with
torches
,
but
old
Rouault
could
not
understand
such
an
idea
.
So
*NL*
there
was
a
wedding
at
which
forty-three
persons
were
present
,
at
which
*NL*
they
remained
sixteen
hours
at
table
,
began
again
the
next
day
,
and
to
*NL*
some
extent
on
the
days
following
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Four
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
arrived
early
in
carriages
,
in
one-horse
chaises
,
two-wheeled
*NL*
cars
,
old
open
gigs
,
waggonettes
with
leather
hoods
,
and
the
young
*NL*
people
from
the
nearer
villages
in
carts
,
in
which
they
stood
up
in
*NL*
rows
,
holding
on
to
the
sides
so
as
not
to
fall
,
going
at
a
trot
*NL*
and
well
shaken
up
.
Some
came
from
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
,
from
*NL*
Goderville
,
from
Normanville
,
and
from
Cany
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
relatives
of
both
families
had
been
invited
,
quarrels
between
*NL*
friends
arranged
,
acquaintances
long
since
lost
sight
of
written
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
one
heard
the
crack
of
a
whip
behind
the
hedge
;
then
*NL*
the
gates
opened
,
a
chaise
entered
.
Galloping
up
to
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
steps
,
it
stopped
short
and
emptied
its
load
.
They
got
down
from
all
*NL*
sides
,
rubbing
knees
and
stretching
arms
.
The
ladies
,
wearing
bonnets
,
*NL*
had
on
dresses
in
the
town
fashion
,
gold
watch
chains
,
pelerines
with
*NL*
the
ends
tucked
into
belts
,
or
little
coloured
fichus
fastened
down
*NL*
behind
with
a
pin
,
and
that
left
the
back
of
the
neck
bare
.
The
lads
,
*NL*
dressed
like
their
papas
,
seemed
uncomfortable
in
their
new
clothes
*NL*
-LRB-
many
that
day
hand-sewed
their
first
pair
of
boots
-RRB-
,
and
by
their
*NL*
sides
,
speaking
never
a
work
,
wearing
the
white
dress
of
their
first
*NL*
communion
lengthened
for
the
occasion
were
some
big
girls
of
fourteen
or
*NL*
sixteen
,
cousins
or
elder
sisters
no
doubt
,
rubicund
,
bewildered
,
their
*NL*
hair
greasy
with
rose
pomade
,
and
very
much
afraid
of
dirtying
their
*NL*
gloves
.
As
there
were
not
enough
stable-boys
to
unharness
all
the
*NL*
carriages
,
the
gentlemen
turned
up
their
sleeves
and
set
about
it
*NL*
themselves
.
According
to
their
different
social
positions
they
wore
*NL*
tail-coats
,
overcoats
,
shooting
jackets
,
cutaway-coats
;
fine
tail-coats
,
*NL*
redolent
of
family
respectability
,
that
only
came
out
of
the
wardrobe
*NL*
on
state
occasions
;
overcoats
with
long
tails
flapping
in
the
wind
and
*NL*
round
capes
and
pockets
like
sacks
;
shooting
jackets
of
coarse
*NL*
cloth
,
generally
worn
with
a
cap
with
a
brass-bound
peak
;
very
short
*NL*
cutaway-coats
with
two
small
buttons
in
the
back
,
close
together
like
*NL*
a
pair
of
eyes
,
and
the
tails
of
which
seemed
cut
out
of
one
piece
by
a
*NL*
carpenter
's
hatchet
.
Some
,
too
-LRB-
but
these
,
you
may
be
sure
,
would
sit
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
table
-RRB-
,
wore
their
best
blouses
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
with
collars
turned
down
to
the
shoulders
,
the
back
gathered
into
small
*NL*
plaits
and
the
waist
fastened
very
low
down
with
a
worked
belt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
shirts
stood
out
from
the
chests
like
cuirasses
!
Everyone
had
*NL*
just
had
his
hair
cut
;
ears
stood
out
from
the
heads
;
they
had
been
*NL*
close-shaved
;
a
few
,
even
,
who
had
had
to
get
up
before
daybreak
,
and
*NL*
not
been
able
to
see
to
shave
,
had
diagonal
gashes
under
their
noses
or
*NL*
cuts
the
size
of
a
three-franc
piece
along
the
jaws
,
which
the
fresh
*NL*
air
en
route
had
enflamed
,
so
that
the
great
white
beaming
faces
were
*NL*
mottled
here
and
there
with
red
dabs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mairie
was
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
farm
,
and
they
went
thither
*NL*
on
foot
,
returning
in
the
same
way
after
the
ceremony
in
the
church
.
*NL*
The
procession
,
first
united
like
one
long
coloured
scarf
that
undulated
*NL*
across
the
fields
,
along
the
narrow
path
winding
amid
the
green
corn
,
*NL*
soon
lengthened
out
,
and
broke
up
into
different
groups
that
loitered
to
*NL*
talk
.
The
fiddler
walked
in
front
with
his
violin
,
gay
with
ribbons
at
*NL*
its
pegs
.
Then
came
the
married
pair
,
the
relations
,
the
friends
,
all
*NL*
following
pell-mell
;
the
children
stayed
behind
amusing
themselves
*NL*
plucking
the
bell-flowers
from
oat-ears
,
or
playing
amongst
themselves
*NL*
unseen
.
Emma
's
dress
,
too
long
,
trailed
a
little
on
the
ground
;
from
*NL*
time
to
time
she
stopped
to
pull
it
up
,
and
then
delicately
,
with
her
*NL*
gloved
hands
,
she
picked
off
the
coarse
grass
and
the
thistledowns
,
*NL*
while
Charles
,
empty
handed
,
waited
till
she
had
finished
.
Old
Rouault
,
*NL*
with
a
new
silk
hat
and
the
cuffs
of
his
black
coat
covering
his
hands
*NL*
up
to
the
nails
,
gave
his
arm
to
Madame
Bovary
senior
.
As
to
Monsieur
*NL*
Bovary
senior
,
who
,
heartily
despising
all
these
folk
,
had
come
simply
*NL*
in
a
frock-coat
of
military
cut
with
one
row
of
buttons
--
he
was
passing
*NL*
compliments
of
the
bar
to
a
fair
young
peasant
.
She
bowed
,
blushed
,
*NL*
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
The
other
wedding
guests
talked
of
their
*NL*
business
or
played
tricks
behind
each
other
's
backs
,
egging
one
another
*NL*
on
in
advance
to
be
jolly
.
Those
who
listened
could
always
catch
the
*NL*
squeaking
of
the
fiddler
,
who
went
on
playing
across
the
fields
.
When
*NL*
he
saw
that
the
rest
were
far
behind
he
stopped
to
take
breath
,
slowly
*NL*
rosined
his
bow
,
so
that
the
strings
should
sound
more
shrilly
,
then
set
*NL*
off
again
,
by
turns
lowering
and
raising
his
neck
,
the
better
to
mark
*NL*
time
for
himself
.
The
noise
of
the
instrument
drove
away
the
little
*NL*
birds
from
afar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
table
was
laid
under
the
cart-shed
.
On
it
were
four
sirloins
,
six
*NL*
chicken
fricassees
,
stewed
veal
,
three
legs
of
mutton
,
and
in
the
middle
*NL*
a
fine
roast
suckling
pig
,
flanked
by
four
chitterlings
with
sorrel
.
At
*NL*
the
corners
were
decanters
of
brandy
.
Sweet
bottled-cider
frothed
round
*NL*
the
corks
,
and
all
the
glasses
had
been
filled
to
the
brim
with
wine
*NL*
beforehand
.
Large
dishes
of
yellow
cream
,
that
trembled
with
the
least
*NL*
shake
of
the
table
,
had
designed
on
their
smooth
surface
the
initials
of
*NL*
the
newly
wedded
pair
in
nonpareil
arabesques
.
A
confectioner
of
Yvetot
*NL*
had
been
intrusted
with
the
tarts
and
sweets
.
As
he
had
only
just
set
up
*NL*
on
the
place
,
he
had
taken
a
lot
of
trouble
,
and
at
dessert
he
himself
*NL*
brought
in
a
set
dish
that
evoked
loud
cries
of
wonderment
.
To
begin
*NL*
with
,
at
its
base
there
was
a
square
of
blue
cardboard
,
representing
a
*NL*
temple
with
porticoes
,
colonnades
,
and
stucco
statuettes
all
round
,
and
*NL*
in
the
niches
constellations
of
gilt
paper
stars
;
then
on
the
second
*NL*
stage
was
a
dungeon
of
Savoy
cake
,
surrounded
by
many
fortifications
*NL*
in
candied
angelica
,
almonds
,
raisins
,
and
quarters
of
oranges
;
and
*NL*
finally
,
on
the
upper
platform
a
green
field
with
rocks
set
in
lakes
of
*NL*
jam
,
nutshell
boats
,
and
a
small
Cupid
balancing
himself
in
a
chocolate
*NL*
swing
whose
two
uprights
ended
in
real
roses
for
balls
at
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
Until
night
they
ate
.
When
any
of
them
were
too
tired
of
sitting
,
they
*NL*
went
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
yard
,
or
for
a
game
with
corks
in
the
*NL*
granary
,
and
then
returned
to
table
.
Some
towards
the
finish
went
to
*NL*
sleep
and
snored
.
But
with
the
coffee
everyone
woke
up
.
Then
they
began
*NL*
songs
,
showed
off
tricks
,
raised
heavy
weights
,
performed
feats
with
*NL*
their
fingers
,
then
tried
lifting
carts
on
their
shoulders
,
made
broad
*NL*
jokes
,
kissed
the
women
.
At
night
when
they
left
,
the
horses
,
stuffed
*NL*
up
to
the
nostrils
with
oats
,
could
hardly
be
got
into
the
shafts
;
they
*NL*
kicked
,
reared
,
the
harness
broke
,
their
masters
laughed
or
swore
;
*NL*
and
all
night
in
the
light
of
the
moon
along
country
roads
there
were
*NL*
runaway
carts
at
full
gallop
plunging
into
the
ditches
,
jumping
over
*NL*
yard
after
yard
of
stones
,
clambering
up
the
hills
,
with
women
leaning
*NL*
out
from
the
tilt
to
catch
hold
of
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
stayed
at
the
Bertaux
spent
the
night
drinking
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
The
children
had
fallen
asleep
under
the
seats
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bride
had
begged
her
father
to
be
spared
the
usual
marriage
*NL*
pleasantries
.
However
,
a
fishmonger
,
one
of
their
cousins
-LRB-
who
had
even
*NL*
brought
a
pair
of
soles
for
his
wedding
present
-RRB-
,
began
to
squirt
water
*NL*
from
his
mouth
through
the
keyhole
,
when
old
Rouault
came
up
just
in
*NL*
time
to
stop
him
,
and
explain
to
him
that
the
distinguished
position
*NL*
of
his
son-in-law
would
not
allow
of
such
liberties
.
The
cousin
all
the
*NL*
same
did
not
give
in
to
these
reasons
readily
.
In
his
heart
he
accused
*NL*
old
Rouault
of
being
proud
,
and
he
joined
four
or
five
other
guests
in
*NL*
a
corner
,
who
having
,
through
mere
chance
,
been
several
times
running
*NL*
served
with
the
worst
helps
of
meat
,
also
were
of
opinion
they
had
been
*NL*
badly
used
,
and
were
whispering
about
their
host
,
and
with
covered
hints
*NL*
hoping
he
would
ruin
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
,
senior
,
had
not
opened
her
mouth
all
day
.
She
had
been
*NL*
consulted
neither
as
to
the
dress
of
her
daughter-in-law
nor
as
to
the
*NL*
arrangement
of
the
feast
;
she
went
to
bed
early
.
Her
husband
,
instead
*NL*
of
following
her
,
sent
to
Saint-Victor
for
some
cigars
,
and
smoked
till
*NL*
daybreak
,
drinking
kirsch-punch
,
a
mixture
unknown
to
the
company
.
This
*NL*
added
greatly
to
the
consideration
in
which
he
was
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
who
was
not
of
a
facetious
turn
,
did
not
shine
at
the
wedding
.
*NL*
He
answered
feebly
to
the
puns
,
doubles
entendres
*
,
compliments
,
and
*NL*
chaff
that
it
was
felt
a
duty
to
let
off
at
him
as
soon
as
the
soup
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*

Double
meanings

*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
seemed
another
man
.
It
was
he
who
*NL*
might
rather
have
been
taken
for
the
virgin
of
the
evening
before
,
*NL*
whilst
the
bride
gave
no
sign
that
revealed
anything
.
The
shrewdest
did
*NL*
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
and
they
looked
at
her
when
she
passed
*NL*
near
them
with
an
unbounded
concentration
of
mind
.
But
Charles
concealed
*NL*
nothing
.
He
called
her
``
my
wife
''
,
tutoyed
*
her
,
asked
for
her
of
*NL*
everyone
,
looked
for
her
everywhere
,
and
often
he
dragged
her
into
the
*NL*
yards
,
where
he
could
be
seen
from
far
between
the
trees
,
putting
his
*NL*
arm
around
her
waist
,
and
walking
half-bending
over
her
,
ruffling
the
*NL*
chemisette
of
her
bodice
with
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Used
the
familiar
form
of
address
.

*NL*
Two
days
after
the
wedding
the
married
pair
left
.
Charles
,
on
account
of
*NL*
his
patients
,
could
not
be
away
longer
.
Old
Rouault
had
them
driven
back
*NL*
in
his
cart
,
and
himself
accompanied
them
as
far
as
Vassonville
.
Here
*NL*
he
embraced
his
daughter
for
the
last
time
,
got
down
,
and
went
his
way
.
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
about
a
hundred
paces
he
stopped
,
and
as
he
saw
the
*NL*
cart
disappearing
,
its
wheels
turning
in
the
dust
,
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
.
*NL*
Then
he
remembered
his
wedding
,
the
old
times
,
the
first
pregnancy
of
*NL*
his
wife
;
he
,
too
,
had
been
very
happy
the
day
when
he
had
taken
her
*NL*
from
her
father
to
his
home
,
and
had
carried
her
off
on
a
pillion
,
*NL*
trotting
through
the
snow
,
for
it
was
near
Christmas-time
,
and
the
*NL*
country
was
all
white
.
She
held
him
by
one
arm
,
her
basket
hanging
from
*NL*
the
other
;
the
wind
blew
the
long
lace
of
her
Cauchois
headdress
so
that
*NL*
it
sometimes
flapped
across
his
mouth
,
and
when
he
turned
his
head
he
*NL*
saw
near
him
,
on
his
shoulder
,
her
little
rosy
face
,
smiling
silently
*NL*
under
the
gold
bands
of
her
cap
.
To
warm
her
hands
she
put
them
from
*NL*
time
to
time
in
his
breast
.
How
long
ago
it
all
was
!
Their
son
would
*NL*
have
been
thirty
by
now
.
Then
he
looked
back
and
saw
nothing
on
the
*NL*
road
.
He
felt
dreary
as
an
empty
house
;
and
tender
memories
mingling
*NL*
with
the
sad
thoughts
in
his
brain
,
addled
by
the
fumes
of
the
feast
,
he
*NL*
felt
inclined
for
a
moment
to
take
a
turn
towards
the
church
.
As
he
was
*NL*
afraid
,
however
,
that
this
sight
would
make
him
yet
more
sad
,
he
went
*NL*
right
away
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
and
Madame
Charles
arrived
at
Tostes
about
six
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbors
came
to
the
windows
to
see
their
doctor
's
new
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
servant
presented
herself
,
curtsied
to
her
,
apologised
for
not
*NL*
having
dinner
ready
,
and
suggested
that
madame
,
in
the
meantime
,
should
*NL*
look
over
her
house
.

Chapter
Five
*NL*
*NL*
The
brick
front
was
just
in
a
line
with
the
street
,
or
rather
the
road
.
*NL*
Behind
the
door
hung
a
cloak
with
a
small
collar
,
a
bridle
,
and
a
black
*NL*
leather
cap
,
and
on
the
floor
,
in
a
corner
,
were
a
pair
of
leggings
,
*NL*
still
covered
with
dry
mud
.
On
the
right
was
the
one
apartment
,
that
was
*NL*
both
dining
and
sitting
room
.
A
canary
yellow
paper
,
relieved
at
the
*NL*
top
by
a
garland
of
pale
flowers
,
was
puckered
everywhere
over
the
badly
*NL*
stretched
canvas
;
white
calico
curtains
with
a
red
border
hung
crossways
*NL*
at
the
length
of
the
window
;
and
on
the
narrow
mantelpiece
a
clock
with
*NL*
a
head
of
Hippocrates
shone
resplendent
between
two
plate
candlesticks
*NL*
under
oval
shades
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
passage
was
Charles
's
*NL*
consulting
room
,
a
little
room
about
six
paces
wide
,
with
a
table
,
*NL*
three
chairs
,
and
an
office
chair
.
Volumes
of
the
``
Dictionary
of
Medical
*NL*
Science
,
''
uncut
,
but
the
binding
rather
the
worse
for
the
successive
*NL*
sales
through
which
they
had
gone
,
occupied
almost
along
the
six
shelves
*NL*
of
a
deal
bookcase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smell
of
melted
butter
penetrated
through
the
walls
when
he
saw
*NL*
patients
,
just
as
in
the
kitchen
one
could
hear
the
people
coughing
in
*NL*
the
consulting
room
and
recounting
their
histories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
opening
on
the
yard
,
where
the
stable
was
,
came
a
large
*NL*
dilapidated
room
with
a
stove
,
now
used
as
a
wood-house
,
cellar
,
and
*NL*
pantry
,
full
of
old
rubbish
,
of
empty
casks
,
agricultural
implements
*NL*
past
service
,
and
a
mass
of
dusty
things
whose
use
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
,
longer
than
wide
,
ran
between
two
mud
walls
with
espaliered
*NL*
apricots
,
to
a
hawthorn
hedge
that
separated
it
from
the
field
.
In
the
*NL*
middle
was
a
slate
sundial
on
a
brick
pedestal
;
four
flower
beds
with
*NL*
eglantines
surrounded
symmetrically
the
more
useful
kitchen
garden
bed
.
*NL*
Right
at
the
bottom
,
under
the
spruce
bushes
,
was
a
cure
in
plaster
*NL*
reading
his
breviary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
went
upstairs
.
The
first
room
was
not
furnished
,
but
in
the
second
,
*NL*
which
was
their
bedroom
,
was
a
mahogany
bedstead
in
an
alcove
with
red
*NL*
drapery
.
A
shell
box
adorned
the
chest
of
drawers
,
and
on
the
secretary
*NL*
near
the
window
a
bouquet
of
orange
blossoms
tied
with
white
satin
*NL*
ribbons
stood
in
a
bottle
.
It
was
a
bride
's
bouquet
;
it
was
the
other
*NL*
one
's
.
She
looked
at
it
.
Charles
noticed
it
;
he
took
it
and
carried
it
*NL*
up
to
the
attic
,
while
Emma
seated
in
an
arm-chair
-LRB-
they
were
putting
*NL*
her
things
down
around
her
-RRB-
thought
of
her
bridal
flowers
packed
up
in
*NL*
a
bandbox
,
and
wondered
,
dreaming
,
what
would
be
done
with
them
if
she
*NL*
were
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
days
she
occupied
herself
in
thinking
about
changes
in
*NL*
the
house
.
She
took
the
shades
off
the
candlesticks
,
had
new
wallpaper
*NL*
put
up
,
the
staircase
repainted
,
and
seats
made
in
the
garden
round
the
*NL*
sundial
;
she
even
inquired
how
she
could
get
a
basin
with
a
jet
fountain
*NL*
and
fishes
.
Finally
her
husband
,
knowing
that
she
liked
to
drive
out
,
*NL*
picked
up
a
second-hand
dogcart
,
which
,
with
new
lamps
and
splashboard
*NL*
in
striped
leather
,
looked
almost
like
a
tilbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
happy
then
,
and
without
a
care
in
the
world
.
A
meal
together
,
*NL*
a
walk
in
the
evening
on
the
highroad
,
a
gesture
of
her
hands
over
her
*NL*
hair
,
the
sight
of
her
straw
hat
hanging
from
the
window-fastener
,
and
*NL*
many
another
thing
in
which
Charles
had
never
dreamed
of
pleasure
,
now
*NL*
made
up
the
endless
round
of
his
happiness
.
In
bed
,
in
the
morning
,
by
*NL*
her
side
,
on
the
pillow
,
he
watched
the
sunlight
sinking
into
the
down
*NL*
on
her
fair
cheek
,
half
hidden
by
the
lappets
of
her
night-cap
.
Seen
*NL*
thus
closely
,
her
eyes
looked
to
him
enlarged
,
especially
when
,
on
*NL*
waking
up
,
she
opened
and
shut
them
rapidly
many
times
.
Black
in
the
*NL*
shade
,
dark
blue
in
broad
daylight
,
they
had
,
as
it
were
,
depths
of
*NL*
different
colours
,
that
,
darker
in
the
centre
,
grew
paler
towards
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
eye
.
His
own
eyes
lost
themselves
in
these
depths
;
he
saw
*NL*
himself
in
miniature
down
to
the
shoulders
,
with
his
handkerchief
round
*NL*
his
head
and
the
top
of
his
shirt
open
.
He
rose
.
She
came
to
the
window
*NL*
to
see
him
off
,
and
stayed
leaning
on
the
sill
between
two
pots
of
*NL*
geranium
,
clad
in
her
dressing
gown
hanging
loosely
about
her
.
Charles
,
*NL*
in
the
street
buckled
his
spurs
,
his
foot
on
the
mounting
stone
,
while
*NL*
she
talked
to
him
from
above
,
picking
with
her
mouth
some
scrap
of
*NL*
flower
or
leaf
that
she
blew
out
at
him
.
Then
this
,
eddying
,
floating
,
*NL*
described
semicircles
in
the
air
like
a
bird
,
and
was
caught
before
*NL*
it
reached
the
ground
in
the
ill-groomed
mane
of
the
old
white
mare
*NL*
standing
motionless
at
the
door
.
Charles
from
horseback
threw
her
a
*NL*
kiss
;
she
answered
with
a
nod
;
she
shut
the
window
,
and
he
set
off
.
And
*NL*
then
along
the
highroad
,
spreading
out
its
long
ribbon
of
dust
,
along
*NL*
the
deep
lanes
that
the
trees
bent
over
as
in
arbours
,
along
paths
where
*NL*
the
corn
reached
to
the
knees
,
with
the
sun
on
his
back
and
the
morning
*NL*
air
in
his
nostrils
,
his
heart
full
of
the
joys
of
the
past
night
,
his
*NL*
mind
at
rest
,
his
flesh
at
ease
,
he
went
on
,
re-chewing
his
happiness
,
*NL*
like
those
who
after
dinner
taste
again
the
truffles
which
they
are
*NL*
digesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Until
now
what
good
had
he
had
of
his
life
?
His
time
at
school
,
when
*NL*
he
remained
shut
up
within
the
high
walls
,
alone
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
companions
richer
than
he
or
cleverer
at
their
work
,
who
laughed
at
his
*NL*
accent
,
who
jeered
at
his
clothes
,
and
whose
mothers
came
to
the
school
*NL*
with
cakes
in
their
muffs
?
Later
on
,
when
he
studied
medicine
,
and
never
*NL*
had
his
purse
full
enough
to
treat
some
little
work-girl
who
would
have
*NL*
become
his
mistress
?
Afterwards
,
he
had
lived
fourteen
months
with
the
*NL*
widow
,
whose
feet
in
bed
were
cold
as
icicles
.
But
now
he
had
for
life
*NL*
this
beautiful
woman
whom
he
adored
.
For
him
the
universe
did
not
extend
*NL*
beyond
the
circumference
of
her
petticoat
,
and
he
reproached
himself
*NL*
with
not
loving
her
.
He
wanted
to
see
her
again
;
he
turned
back
quickly
,
*NL*
ran
up
the
stairs
with
a
beating
heart
.
Emma
,
in
her
room
,
was
dressing
;
*NL*
he
came
up
on
tiptoe
,
kissed
her
back
;
she
gave
a
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
keep
from
constantly
touching
her
comb
,
her
ring
,
her
*NL*
fichu
;
sometimes
he
gave
her
great
sounding
kisses
with
all
his
mouth
on
*NL*
her
cheeks
,
or
else
little
kisses
in
a
row
all
along
her
bare
arm
*NL*
from
the
tip
of
her
fingers
up
to
her
shoulder
,
and
she
put
him
away
*NL*
half-smiling
,
half-vexed
,
as
you
do
a
child
who
hangs
about
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
marriage
she
thought
herself
in
love
;
but
the
happiness
that
*NL*
should
have
followed
this
love
not
having
come
,
she
must
,
she
thought
,
*NL*
have
been
mistaken
.
And
Emma
tried
to
find
out
what
one
meant
exactly
in
*NL*
life
by
the
words
felicity
,
passion
,
rapture
,
that
had
seemed
to
her
so
*NL*
beautiful
in
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Six
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
read
``
Paul
and
Virginia
,
''
and
she
had
dreamed
of
the
little
*NL*
bamboo-house
,
the
nigger
Domingo
,
the
dog
Fidele
,
but
above
all
of
the
*NL*
sweet
friendship
of
some
dear
little
brother
,
who
seeks
red
fruit
for
*NL*
you
on
trees
taller
than
steeples
,
or
who
runs
barefoot
over
the
sand
,
*NL*
bringing
you
a
bird
's
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
thirteen
,
her
father
himself
took
her
to
town
to
place
*NL*
her
in
the
convent
.
They
stopped
at
an
inn
in
the
St.
Gervais
quarter
,
*NL*
where
,
at
their
supper
,
they
used
painted
plates
that
set
forth
the
*NL*
story
of
Mademoiselle
de
la
Valliere
.
The
explanatory
legends
,
chipped
*NL*
here
and
there
by
the
scratching
of
knives
,
all
glorified
religion
,
the
*NL*
tendernesses
of
the
heart
,
and
the
pomps
of
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Far
from
being
bored
at
first
at
the
convent
,
she
took
pleasure
in
the
*NL*
society
of
the
good
sisters
,
who
,
to
amuse
her
,
took
her
to
the
chapel
,
*NL*
which
one
entered
from
the
refectory
by
a
long
corridor
.
She
played
very
*NL*
little
during
recreation
hours
,
knew
her
catechism
well
,
and
it
was
she
*NL*
who
always
answered
Monsieur
le
Vicaire
's
difficult
questions
.
Living
*NL*
thus
,
without
ever
leaving
the
warm
atmosphere
of
the
classrooms
,
and
*NL*
amid
these
pale-faced
women
wearing
rosaries
with
brass
crosses
,
she
*NL*
was
softly
lulled
by
the
mystic
languor
exhaled
in
the
perfumes
of
the
*NL*
altar
,
the
freshness
of
the
holy
water
,
and
the
lights
of
the
tapers
.
*NL*
Instead
of
attending
to
mass
,
she
looked
at
the
pious
vignettes
with
*NL*
their
azure
borders
in
her
book
,
and
she
loved
the
sick
lamb
,
the
sacred
*NL*
heart
pierced
with
sharp
arrows
,
or
the
poor
Jesus
sinking
beneath
the
*NL*
cross
he
carries
.
She
tried
,
by
way
of
mortification
,
to
eat
nothing
a
*NL*
whole
day
.
She
puzzled
her
head
to
find
some
vow
to
fulfil
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
to
confession
,
she
invented
little
sins
in
order
that
she
*NL*
might
stay
there
longer
,
kneeling
in
the
shadow
,
her
hands
joined
,
*NL*
her
face
against
the
grating
beneath
the
whispering
of
the
priest
.
*NL*
The
comparisons
of
betrothed
,
husband
,
celestial
lover
,
and
eternal
*NL*
marriage
,
that
recur
in
sermons
,
stirred
within
her
soul
depths
of
*NL*
unexpected
sweetness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
before
prayers
,
there
was
some
religious
reading
in
*NL*
the
study
.
On
week-nights
it
was
some
abstract
of
sacred
history
or
*NL*
the
Lectures
of
the
Abbe
Frayssinous
,
and
on
Sundays
passages
from
the
*NL*
``
Genie
du
Christianisme
,
''
as
a
recreation
.
How
she
listened
at
first
to
*NL*
the
sonorous
lamentations
of
its
romantic
melancholies
reechoing
*NL*
through
the
world
and
eternity
!
If
her
childhood
had
been
spent
in
the
*NL*
shop-parlour
of
some
business
quarter
,
she
might
perhaps
have
opened
*NL*
her
heart
to
those
lyrical
invasions
of
Nature
,
which
usually
come
to
*NL*
us
only
through
translation
in
books
.
But
she
knew
the
country
too
well
;
*NL*
she
knew
the
lowing
of
cattle
,
the
milking
,
the
ploughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accustomed
to
calm
aspects
of
life
,
she
turned
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
*NL*
those
of
excitement
.
She
loved
the
sea
only
for
the
sake
of
its
storms
,
*NL*
and
the
green
fields
only
when
broken
up
by
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
get
some
personal
profit
out
of
things
,
and
she
rejected
*NL*
as
useless
all
that
did
not
contribute
to
the
immediate
desires
of
her
*NL*
heart
,
being
of
a
temperament
more
sentimental
than
artistic
,
looking
*NL*
for
emotions
,
not
landscapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
convent
there
was
an
old
maid
who
came
for
a
week
each
month
to
*NL*
mend
the
linen
.
Patronized
by
the
clergy
,
because
she
belonged
to
an
*NL*
ancient
family
of
noblemen
ruined
by
the
Revolution
,
she
dined
in
the
*NL*
refectory
at
the
table
of
the
good
sisters
,
and
after
the
meal
had
a
bit
*NL*
of
chat
with
them
before
going
back
to
her
work
.
The
girls
often
slipped
*NL*
out
from
the
study
to
go
and
see
her
.
She
knew
by
heart
the
love
songs
*NL*
of
the
last
century
,
and
sang
them
in
a
low
voice
as
she
stitched
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
stories
,
gave
them
news
,
went
errands
in
the
town
,
and
on
*NL*
the
sly
lent
the
big
girls
some
novel
,
that
she
always
carried
in
the
*NL*
pockets
of
her
apron
,
and
of
which
the
good
lady
herself
swallowed
*NL*
long
chapters
in
the
intervals
of
her
work
.
They
were
all
love
,
lovers
,
*NL*
sweethearts
,
persecuted
ladies
fainting
in
lonely
pavilions
,
postilions
*NL*
killed
at
every
stage
,
horses
ridden
to
death
on
every
page
,
sombre
*NL*
forests
,
heartaches
,
vows
,
sobs
,
tears
and
kisses
,
little
skiffs
by
*NL*
moonlight
,
nightingales
in
shady
groves
,
``
gentlemen
''
brave
as
lions
,
*NL*
gentle
as
lambs
,
virtuous
as
no
one
ever
was
,
always
well
dressed
,
and
*NL*
weeping
like
fountains
.
For
six
months
,
then
,
Emma
,
at
fifteen
years
of
*NL*
age
,
made
her
hands
dirty
with
books
from
old
lending
libraries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
Walter
Scott
,
later
on
,
she
fell
in
love
with
historical
events
,
*NL*
dreamed
of
old
chests
,
guard-rooms
and
minstrels
.
She
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
live
in
some
old
manor-house
,
like
those
long-waisted
chatelaines
*NL*
who
,
in
the
shade
of
pointed
arches
,
spent
their
days
leaning
on
the
*NL*
stone
,
chin
in
hand
,
watching
a
cavalier
with
white
plume
galloping
on
*NL*
his
black
horse
from
the
distant
fields
.
At
this
time
she
had
a
cult
*NL*
for
Mary
Stuart
and
enthusiastic
veneration
for
illustrious
or
unhappy
*NL*
women
.
Joan
of
Arc
,
Heloise
,
Agnes
Sorel
,
the
beautiful
Ferroniere
,
and
*NL*
Clemence
Isaure
stood
out
to
her
like
comets
in
the
dark
immensity
of
*NL*
heaven
,
where
also
were
seen
,
lost
in
shadow
,
and
all
unconnected
,
St.
*NL*
Louis
with
his
oak
,
the
dying
Bayard
,
some
cruelties
of
Louis
XI
,
a
*NL*
little
of
St.
Bartholomew
's
Day
,
the
plume
of
the
Bearnais
,
and
always
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
the
plates
painted
in
honour
of
Louis
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
music
class
,
in
the
ballads
she
sang
,
there
was
nothing
but
*NL*
little
angels
with
golden
wings
,
madonnas
,
lagunes
,
gondoliers
;
-
mild
*NL*
compositions
that
allowed
her
to
catch
a
glimpse
athwart
the
obscurity
*NL*
of
style
and
the
weakness
of
the
music
of
the
attractive
phantasmagoria
*NL*
of
sentimental
realities
.
Some
of
her
companions
brought
``
keepsakes
''
*NL*
given
them
as
new
year
's
gifts
to
the
convent
.
These
had
to
be
hidden
;
*NL*
it
was
quite
an
undertaking
;
they
were
read
in
the
dormitory
.
Delicately
*NL*
handling
the
beautiful
satin
bindings
,
Emma
looked
with
dazzled
eyes
at
*NL*
the
names
of
the
unknown
authors
,
who
had
signed
their
verses
for
the
*NL*
most
part
as
counts
or
viscounts
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
trembled
as
she
blew
back
the
tissue
paper
over
the
engraving
and
*NL*
saw
it
folded
in
two
and
fall
gently
against
the
page
.
Here
behind
the
*NL*
balustrade
of
a
balcony
was
a
young
man
in
a
short
cloak
,
holding
in
his
*NL*
arms
a
young
girl
in
a
white
dress
wearing
an
alms-bag
at
her
belt
;
or
*NL*
there
were
nameless
portraits
of
English
ladies
with
fair
curls
,
who
*NL*
looked
at
you
from
under
their
round
straw
hats
with
their
large
clear
*NL*
eyes
.
Some
there
were
lounging
in
their
carriages
,
gliding
through
*NL*
parks
,
a
greyhound
bounding
along
in
front
of
the
equipage
driven
at
*NL*
a
trot
by
two
midget
postilions
in
white
breeches
.
Others
,
dreaming
on
*NL*
sofas
with
an
open
letter
,
gazed
at
the
moon
through
a
slightly
open
*NL*
window
half
draped
by
a
black
curtain
.
The
naive
ones
,
a
tear
on
their
*NL*
cheeks
,
were
kissing
doves
through
the
bars
of
a
Gothic
cage
,
or
,
*NL*
smiling
,
their
heads
on
one
side
,
were
plucking
the
leaves
of
a
*NL*
marguerite
with
their
taper
fingers
,
that
curved
at
the
tips
like
peaked
*NL*
shoes
.
And
you
,
too
,
were
there
,
Sultans
with
long
pipes
reclining
*NL*
beneath
arbours
in
the
arms
of
Bayaderes
;
Djiaours
,
Turkish
sabres
,
*NL*
Greek
caps
;
and
you
especially
,
pale
landscapes
of
dithyrambic
lands
,
*NL*
that
often
show
us
at
once
palm
trees
and
firs
,
tigers
on
the
right
,
a
*NL*
lion
to
the
left
,
Tartar
minarets
on
the
horizon
;
the
whole
framed
by
*NL*
a
very
neat
virgin
forest
,
and
with
a
great
perpendicular
sunbeam
*NL*
trembling
in
the
water
,
where
,
standing
out
in
relief
like
white
*NL*
excoriations
on
a
steel-grey
ground
,
swans
are
swimming
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
shade
of
the
argand
lamp
fastened
to
the
wall
above
Emma
's
head
*NL*
lighted
up
all
these
pictures
of
the
world
,
that
passed
before
her
one
*NL*
by
one
in
the
silence
of
the
dormitory
,
and
to
the
distant
noise
of
some
*NL*
belated
carriage
rolling
over
the
Boulevards
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
mother
died
she
cried
much
the
first
few
days
.
She
had
a
*NL*
funeral
picture
made
with
the
hair
of
the
deceased
,
and
,
in
a
letter
*NL*
sent
to
the
Bertaux
full
of
sad
reflections
on
life
,
she
asked
to
be
*NL*
buried
later
on
in
the
same
grave
.
The
goodman
thought
she
must
be
ill
,
*NL*
and
came
to
see
her
.
Emma
was
secretly
pleased
that
she
had
reached
at
*NL*
a
first
attempt
the
rare
ideal
of
pale
lives
,
never
attained
by
mediocre
*NL*
hearts
.
She
let
herself
glide
along
with
Lamartine
meanderings
,
listened
*NL*
to
harps
on
lakes
,
to
all
the
songs
of
dying
swans
,
to
the
falling
of
*NL*
the
leaves
,
the
pure
virgins
ascending
to
heaven
,
and
the
voice
of
*NL*
the
Eternal
discoursing
down
the
valleys
.
She
wearied
of
it
,
would
not
*NL*
confess
it
,
continued
from
habit
,
and
at
last
was
surprised
to
feel
*NL*
herself
soothed
,
and
with
no
more
sadness
at
heart
than
wrinkles
on
her
*NL*
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
nuns
,
who
had
been
so
sure
of
her
vocation
,
perceived
with
*NL*
great
astonishment
that
Mademoiselle
Rouault
seemed
to
be
slipping
*NL*
from
them
.
They
had
indeed
been
so
lavish
to
her
of
prayers
,
retreats
,
*NL*
novenas
,
and
sermons
,
they
had
so
often
preached
the
respect
due
to
*NL*
saints
and
martyrs
,
and
given
so
much
good
advice
as
to
the
modesty
of
*NL*
the
body
and
the
salvation
of
her
soul
,
that
she
did
as
tightly
reined
*NL*
horses
;
she
pulled
up
short
and
the
bit
slipped
from
her
teeth
.
This
*NL*
nature
,
positive
in
the
midst
of
its
enthusiasms
,
that
had
loved
the
*NL*
church
for
the
sake
of
the
flowers
,
and
music
for
the
words
of
the
*NL*
songs
,
and
literature
for
its
passional
stimulus
,
rebelled
against
*NL*
the
mysteries
of
faith
as
it
grew
irritated
by
discipline
,
a
thing
*NL*
antipathetic
to
her
constitution
.
When
her
father
took
her
from
school
,
*NL*
no
one
was
sorry
to
see
her
go
.
The
Lady
Superior
even
thought
that
she
*NL*
had
latterly
been
somewhat
irreverent
to
the
community
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
at
home
once
more
,
first
took
pleasure
in
looking
after
the
*NL*
servants
,
then
grew
disgusted
with
the
country
and
missed
her
convent
.
*NL*
When
Charles
came
to
the
Bertaux
for
the
first
time
,
she
thought
herself
*NL*
quite
disillusioned
,
with
nothing
more
to
learn
,
and
nothing
more
to
*NL*
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
uneasiness
of
her
new
position
,
or
perhaps
the
disturbance
*NL*
caused
by
the
presence
of
this
man
,
had
sufficed
to
make
her
believe
*NL*
that
she
at
last
felt
that
wondrous
passion
which
,
till
then
,
like
a
*NL*
great
bird
with
rose-coloured
wings
,
hung
in
the
splendour
of
the
skies
*NL*
of
poesy
;
and
now
she
could
not
think
that
the
calm
in
which
she
lived
*NL*
was
the
happiness
she
had
dreamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Seven
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
,
sometimes
,
that
,
after
all
,
this
was
the
happiest
time
*NL*
of
her
life
--
the
honeymoon
,
as
people
called
it
.
To
taste
the
full
*NL*
sweetness
of
it
,
it
would
have
been
necessary
doubtless
to
fly
to
those
*NL*
lands
with
sonorous
names
where
the
days
after
marriage
are
full
of
*NL*
laziness
most
suave
.
In
post
chaises
behind
blue
silken
curtains
to
ride
*NL*
slowly
up
steep
road
,
listening
to
the
song
of
the
postilion
re-echoed
*NL*
by
the
mountains
,
along
with
the
bells
of
goats
and
the
muffled
sound
of
*NL*
a
waterfall
;
at
sunset
on
the
shores
of
gulfs
to
breathe
in
the
perfume
*NL*
of
lemon
trees
;
then
in
the
evening
on
the
villa-terraces
above
,
hand
in
*NL*
hand
to
look
at
the
stars
,
making
plans
for
the
future
.
It
seemed
to
her
*NL*
that
certain
places
on
earth
must
bring
happiness
,
as
a
plant
peculiar
*NL*
to
the
soil
,
and
that
can
not
thrive
elsewhere
.
Why
could
not
she
lean
*NL*
over
balconies
in
Swiss
chalets
,
or
enshrine
her
melancholy
in
a
Scotch
*NL*
cottage
,
with
a
husband
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
coat
with
long
tails
,
*NL*
and
thin
shoes
,
a
pointed
hat
and
frills
?
Perhaps
she
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
confide
all
these
things
to
someone
.
But
how
tell
an
undefinable
*NL*
uneasiness
,
variable
as
the
clouds
,
unstable
as
the
winds
?
Words
failed
*NL*
her
--
the
opportunity
,
the
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Charles
had
but
wished
it
,
if
he
had
guessed
it
,
if
his
look
had
but
*NL*
once
met
her
thought
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
sudden
plenty
would
have
*NL*
gone
out
from
her
heart
,
as
the
fruit
falls
from
a
tree
when
shaken
by
*NL*
a
hand
.
But
as
the
intimacy
of
their
life
became
deeper
,
the
greater
*NL*
became
the
gulf
that
separated
her
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
's
conversation
was
commonplace
as
a
street
pavement
,
and
*NL*
everyone
's
ideas
trooped
through
it
in
their
everyday
garb
,
without
*NL*
exciting
emotion
,
laughter
,
or
thought
.
He
had
never
had
the
curiosity
,
*NL*
he
said
,
while
he
lived
at
Rouen
,
to
go
to
the
theatre
to
see
the
actors
*NL*
from
Paris
.
He
could
neither
swim
,
nor
fence
,
nor
shoot
,
and
one
day
*NL*
he
could
not
explain
some
term
of
horsemanship
to
her
that
she
had
come
*NL*
across
in
a
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
,
on
the
contrary
,
should
he
not
know
everything
,
excel
in
manifold
*NL*
activities
,
initiate
you
into
the
energies
of
passion
,
the
refinements
*NL*
of
life
,
all
mysteries
?
But
this
one
taught
nothing
,
knew
nothing
,
*NL*
wished
nothing
.
He
thought
her
happy
;
and
she
resented
this
easy
calm
,
*NL*
this
serene
heaviness
,
the
very
happiness
she
gave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
she
would
draw
;
and
it
was
great
amusement
to
Charles
to
stand
*NL*
there
bolt
upright
and
watch
her
bend
over
her
cardboard
,
with
eyes
*NL*
half-closed
the
better
to
see
her
work
,
or
rolling
,
between
her
fingers
,
*NL*
little
bread-pellets
.
As
to
the
piano
,
the
more
quickly
her
fingers
*NL*
glided
over
it
the
more
he
wondered
.
She
struck
the
notes
with
aplomb
,
*NL*
and
ran
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
keyboard
without
a
break
.
Thus
shaken
*NL*
up
,
the
old
instrument
,
whose
strings
buzzed
,
could
be
heard
at
the
*NL*
other
end
of
the
village
when
the
window
was
open
,
and
often
the
*NL*
bailiff
's
clerk
,
passing
along
the
highroad
bare-headed
and
in
list
*NL*
slippers
,
stopped
to
listen
,
his
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
on
the
other
hand
,
knew
how
to
look
after
her
house
.
She
sent
the
*NL*
patients
'
accounts
in
well-phrased
letters
that
had
no
suggestion
of
*NL*
a
bill
.
When
they
had
a
neighbour
to
dinner
on
Sundays
,
she
managed
to
*NL*
have
some
tasty
dish
--
piled
up
pyramids
of
greengages
on
vine
leaves
,
*NL*
served
up
preserves
turned
out
into
plates
--
and
even
spoke
of
buying
*NL*
finger-glasses
for
dessert
.
From
all
this
much
consideration
was
*NL*
extended
to
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
finished
by
rising
in
his
own
esteem
for
possessing
such
a
wife
.
*NL*
He
showed
with
pride
in
the
sitting
room
two
small
pencil
sketches
by
*NL*
her
that
he
had
had
framed
in
very
large
frames
,
and
hung
up
against
the
*NL*
wallpaper
by
long
green
cords
.
People
returning
from
mass
saw
him
at
his
*NL*
door
in
his
wool-work
slippers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
home
late
--
at
ten
o'clock
,
at
midnight
sometimes
.
Then
he
asked
*NL*
for
something
to
eat
,
and
as
the
servant
had
gone
to
bed
,
Emma
waited
*NL*
on
him
.
He
took
off
his
coat
to
dine
more
at
his
ease
.
He
told
her
,
one
*NL*
after
the
other
,
the
people
he
had
met
,
the
villages
where
he
had
been
,
*NL*
the
prescriptions
he
had
written
,
and
,
well
pleased
with
himself
,
he
*NL*
finished
the
remainder
of
the
boiled
beef
and
onions
,
picked
pieces
off
*NL*
the
cheese
,
munched
an
apple
,
emptied
his
water-bottle
,
and
then
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
and
lay
on
his
back
and
snored
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
been
for
a
time
accustomed
to
wear
nightcaps
,
his
handkerchief
*NL*
would
not
keep
down
over
his
ears
,
so
that
his
hair
in
the
morning
was
*NL*
all
tumbled
pell-mell
about
his
face
and
whitened
with
the
feathers
of
*NL*
the
pillow
,
whose
strings
came
untied
during
the
night
.
He
always
wore
*NL*
thick
boots
that
had
two
long
creases
over
the
instep
running
obliquely
*NL*
towards
the
ankle
,
while
the
rest
of
the
upper
continued
in
a
straight
*NL*
line
as
if
stretched
on
a
wooden
foot
.
He
said
that
``
was
quite
good
*NL*
enough
for
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
approved
of
his
economy
,
for
she
came
to
see
him
as
formerly
*NL*
when
there
had
been
some
violent
row
at
her
place
;
and
yet
Madame
Bovary
*NL*
senior
seemed
prejudiced
against
her
daughter-in-law
.
She
thought
``
her
*NL*
ways
too
fine
for
their
position
''
;
the
wood
,
the
sugar
,
and
the
candles
*NL*
disappeared
as
``
at
a
grand
establishment
,
''
and
the
amount
of
firing
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
would
have
been
enough
for
twenty-five
courses
.
She
put
her
*NL*
linen
in
order
for
her
in
the
presses
,
and
taught
her
to
keep
an
eye
on
*NL*
the
butcher
when
he
brought
the
meat
.
Emma
put
up
with
these
lessons
.
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
was
lavish
of
them
;
and
the
words
``
daughter
''
and
``
mother
''
*NL*
were
exchanged
all
day
long
,
accompanied
by
little
quiverings
of
the
*NL*
lips
,
each
one
uttering
gentle
words
in
a
voice
trembling
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Madame
Dubuc
's
time
the
old
woman
felt
that
she
was
still
the
*NL*
favorite
;
but
now
the
love
of
Charles
for
Emma
seemed
to
her
a
desertion
*NL*
from
her
tenderness
,
an
encroachment
upon
what
was
hers
,
and
she
watched
*NL*
her
son
's
happiness
in
sad
silence
,
as
a
ruined
man
looks
through
*NL*
the
windows
at
people
dining
in
his
old
house
.
She
recalled
to
him
as
*NL*
remembrances
her
troubles
and
her
sacrifices
,
and
,
comparing
these
with
*NL*
Emma
's
negligence
,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
reasonable
to
*NL*
adore
her
so
exclusively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
knew
not
what
to
answer
:
he
respected
his
mother
,
and
he
loved
*NL*
his
wife
infinitely
;
he
considered
the
judgment
of
the
one
infallible
,
*NL*
and
yet
he
thought
the
conduct
of
the
other
irreproachable
.
When
Madam
*NL*
Bovary
had
gone
,
he
tried
timidly
and
in
the
same
terms
to
hazard
one
or
*NL*
two
of
the
more
anodyne
observations
he
had
heard
from
his
mamma
.
Emma
*NL*
proved
to
him
with
a
word
that
he
was
mistaken
,
and
sent
him
off
to
his
*NL*
patients
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
in
accord
with
theories
she
believed
right
,
she
wanted
to
make
*NL*
herself
in
love
with
him
.
By
moonlight
in
the
garden
she
recited
all
*NL*
the
passionate
rhymes
she
knew
by
heart
,
and
,
sighing
,
sang
to
him
many
*NL*
melancholy
adagios
;
but
she
found
herself
as
calm
after
as
before
,
and
*NL*
Charles
seemed
no
more
amorous
and
no
more
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
thus
for
a
while
struck
the
flint
on
her
heart
without
*NL*
getting
a
spark
,
incapable
,
moreover
,
of
understanding
what
she
did
*NL*
not
experience
as
of
believing
anything
that
did
not
present
itself
*NL*
in
conventional
forms
,
she
persuaded
herself
without
difficulty
that
*NL*
Charles
's
passion
was
nothing
very
exorbitant
.
His
outbursts
became
*NL*
regular
;
he
embraced
her
at
certain
fixed
times
.
It
was
one
habit
among
*NL*
other
habits
,
and
,
like
a
dessert
,
looked
forward
to
after
the
monotony
*NL*
of
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gamekeeper
,
cured
by
the
doctor
of
inflammation
of
the
lungs
,
had
*NL*
given
madame
a
little
Italian
greyhound
;
she
took
her
out
walking
,
for
*NL*
she
went
out
sometimes
in
order
to
be
alone
for
a
moment
,
and
not
to
see
*NL*
before
her
eyes
the
eternal
garden
and
the
dusty
road
.
She
went
as
far
*NL*
as
the
beeches
of
Banneville
,
near
the
deserted
pavilion
which
forms
an
*NL*
angle
of
the
wall
on
the
side
of
the
country
.
Amidst
the
vegetation
of
*NL*
the
ditch
there
are
long
reeds
with
leaves
that
cut
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
by
looking
round
her
to
see
if
nothing
had
changed
since
last
*NL*
she
had
been
there
.
She
found
again
in
the
same
places
the
foxgloves
and
*NL*
wallflowers
,
the
beds
of
nettles
growing
round
the
big
stones
,
and
*NL*
the
patches
of
lichen
along
the
three
windows
,
whose
shutters
,
always
*NL*
closed
,
were
rotting
away
on
their
rusty
iron
bars
.
Her
thoughts
,
*NL*
aimless
at
first
,
wandered
at
random
,
like
her
greyhound
,
who
ran
round
*NL*
and
round
in
the
fields
,
yelping
after
the
yellow
butterflies
,
chasing
*NL*
the
shrew-mice
,
or
nibbling
the
poppies
on
the
edge
of
a
cornfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
gradually
her
ideas
took
definite
shape
,
and
,
sitting
on
the
grass
*NL*
that
she
dug
up
with
little
prods
of
her
sunshade
,
Emma
repeated
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
Good
heavens
!
Why
did
I
marry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
herself
if
by
some
other
chance
combination
it
would
have
not
*NL*
been
possible
to
meet
another
man
;
and
she
tried
to
imagine
what
would
*NL*
have
been
these
unrealised
events
,
this
different
life
,
this
unknown
*NL*
husband
.
All
,
surely
,
could
not
be
like
this
one
.
He
might
have
been
*NL*
handsome
,
witty
,
distinguished
,
attractive
,
such
as
,
no
doubt
,
her
old
*NL*
companions
of
the
convent
had
married
.
What
were
they
doing
now
?
In
*NL*
town
,
with
the
noise
of
the
streets
,
the
buzz
of
the
theatres
and
the
*NL*
lights
of
the
ballroom
,
they
were
living
lives
where
the
heart
expands
,
*NL*
the
senses
bourgeon
out
.
But
she
--
her
life
was
cold
as
a
garret
whose
*NL*
dormer
window
looks
on
the
north
,
and
ennui
,
the
silent
spider
,
was
*NL*
weaving
its
web
in
the
darkness
in
every
corner
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
the
prize
days
,
when
she
mounted
the
platform
to
receive
*NL*
her
little
crowns
,
with
her
hair
in
long
plaits
.
In
her
white
frock
and
*NL*
open
prunella
shoes
she
had
a
pretty
way
,
and
when
she
went
back
to
her
*NL*
seat
,
the
gentlemen
bent
over
her
to
congratulate
her
;
the
courtyard
was
*NL*
full
of
carriages
;
farewells
were
called
to
her
through
their
windows
;
*NL*
the
music
master
with
his
violin
case
bowed
in
passing
by
.
How
far
all
*NL*
of
this
!
How
far
away
!
She
called
Djali
,
took
her
between
her
knees
,
and
*NL*
smoothed
the
long
delicate
head
,
saying
,
``
Come
,
kiss
mistress
;
you
have
*NL*
no
troubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
noting
the
melancholy
face
of
the
graceful
animal
,
who
yawned
*NL*
slowly
,
she
softened
,
and
comparing
her
to
herself
,
spoke
to
her
aloud
*NL*
as
to
somebody
in
trouble
whom
one
is
consoling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
there
came
gusts
of
winds
,
breezes
from
the
sea
rolling
in
*NL*
one
sweep
over
the
whole
plateau
of
the
Caux
country
,
which
brought
*NL*
even
to
these
fields
a
salt
freshness
.
The
rushes
,
close
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
whistled
;
the
branches
trembled
in
a
swift
rustling
,
while
their
*NL*
summits
,
ceaselessly
swaying
,
kept
up
a
deep
murmur
.
Emma
drew
her
shawl
*NL*
round
her
shoulders
and
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
avenue
a
green
light
dimmed
by
the
leaves
lit
up
the
short
moss
*NL*
that
crackled
softly
beneath
her
feet
.
The
sun
was
setting
;
the
sky
*NL*
showed
red
between
the
branches
,
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
,
uniform
,
*NL*
and
planted
in
a
straight
line
,
seemed
a
brown
colonnade
standing
out
*NL*
against
a
background
of
gold
.
A
fear
took
hold
of
her
;
she
called
Djali
,
*NL*
and
hurriedly
returned
to
Tostes
by
the
high
road
,
threw
herself
into
an
*NL*
armchair
,
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
towards
the
end
of
September
something
extraordinary
fell
upon
her
*NL*
life
;
she
was
invited
by
the
Marquis
d'Andervilliers
to
Vaubyessard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Secretary
of
State
under
the
Restoration
,
the
Marquis
,
anxious
to
*NL*
re-enter
political
life
,
set
about
preparing
for
his
candidature
to
*NL*
the
Chamber
of
Deputies
long
beforehand
.
In
the
winter
he
distributed
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
wood
,
and
in
the
Conseil
General
always
enthusiastically
*NL*
demanded
new
roads
for
his
arrondissement
.
During
the
dog-days
he
had
*NL*
suffered
from
an
abscess
,
which
Charles
had
cured
as
if
by
miracle
by
*NL*
giving
a
timely
little
touch
with
the
lancet
.
The
steward
sent
to
Tostes
*NL*
to
pay
for
the
operation
reported
in
the
evening
that
he
had
seen
some
*NL*
superb
cherries
in
the
doctor
's
little
garden
.
Now
cherry
trees
did
not
*NL*
thrive
at
Vaubyessard
;
the
Marquis
asked
Bovary
for
some
slips
;
made
it
*NL*
his
business
to
thank
his
personally
;
saw
Emma
;
thought
she
had
a
pretty
*NL*
figure
,
and
that
she
did
not
bow
like
a
peasant
;
so
that
he
did
not
*NL*
think
he
was
going
beyond
the
bounds
of
condescension
,
nor
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
making
a
mistake
,
in
inviting
the
young
couple
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Wednesday
at
three
o'clock
,
Monsieur
and
Madame
Bovary
,
seated
in
*NL*
their
dog-cart
,
set
out
for
Vaubyessard
,
with
a
great
trunk
strapped
*NL*
on
behind
and
a
bonnet-box
in
front
of
the
apron
.
Besides
these
Charles
*NL*
held
a
bandbox
between
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
at
nightfall
,
just
as
the
lamps
in
the
park
were
being
lit
*NL*
to
show
the
way
for
the
carriages
.

*NL*
Chapter
Eight
*NL*
*NL*
The
chateau
,
a
modern
building
in
Italian
style
,
with
two
projecting
*NL*
wings
and
three
flights
of
steps
,
lay
at
the
foot
of
an
immense
*NL*
green-sward
,
on
which
some
cows
were
grazing
among
groups
of
large
trees
*NL*
set
out
at
regular
intervals
,
while
large
beds
of
arbutus
,
rhododendron
,
*NL*
syringas
,
and
guelder
roses
bulged
out
their
irregular
clusters
of
*NL*
green
along
the
curve
of
the
gravel
path
.
A
river
flowed
under
a
bridge
;
*NL*
through
the
mist
one
could
distinguish
buildings
with
thatched
roofs
*NL*
scattered
over
the
field
bordered
by
two
gently
sloping
,
well
timbered
*NL*
hillocks
,
and
in
the
background
amid
the
trees
rose
in
two
parallel
*NL*
lines
the
coach
houses
and
stables
,
all
that
was
left
of
the
ruined
old
*NL*
chateau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
's
dog-cart
pulled
up
before
the
middle
flight
of
steps
;
servants
*NL*
appeared
;
the
Marquis
came
forward
,
and
,
offering
his
arm
to
the
*NL*
doctor
's
wife
,
conducted
her
to
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
paved
with
marble
slabs
,
was
very
lofty
,
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
footsteps
and
that
of
voices
re-echoed
through
it
as
in
a
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
rose
a
straight
staircase
,
and
on
the
left
a
gallery
*NL*
overlooking
the
garden
led
to
the
billiard
room
,
through
whose
door
one
*NL*
could
hear
the
click
of
the
ivory
balls
.
As
she
crossed
it
to
go
to
the
*NL*
drawing
room
,
Emma
saw
standing
round
the
table
men
with
grave
faces
,
*NL*
their
chins
resting
on
high
cravats
.
They
all
wore
orders
,
and
smiled
*NL*
silently
as
they
made
their
strokes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
dark
wainscoting
of
the
walls
large
gold
frames
bore
at
*NL*
the
bottom
names
written
in
black
letters
.
She
read
:
``
Jean-Antoine
*NL*
d'Andervilliers
d'Yvervonbille
,
Count
de
la
Vaubyessard
and
Baron
de
la
*NL*
Fresnay
,
killed
at
the
battle
of
Coutras
on
the
20th
of
October
,
*NL*
1587
.
''
And
on
another
:
``
Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy
d'Andervilliers
de
*NL*
la
Vaubyessard
,
Admiral
of
France
and
Chevalier
of
the
Order
of
St.
*NL*
Michael
,
wounded
at
the
battle
of
the
Hougue-Saint-Vaast
on
the
29th
of
*NL*
May
,
1692
;
died
at
Vaubyessard
on
the
23rd
of
January
1693
.
''
One
could
*NL*
hardly
make
out
those
that
followed
,
for
the
light
of
the
lamps
lowered
*NL*
over
the
green
cloth
threw
a
dim
shadow
round
the
room
.
Burnishing
the
*NL*
horizontal
pictures
,
it
broke
up
against
these
in
delicate
lines
where
*NL*
there
were
cracks
in
the
varnish
,
and
from
all
these
great
black
squares
*NL*
framed
in
with
gold
stood
out
here
and
there
some
lighter
portion
of
the
*NL*
painting
--
a
pale
brow
,
two
eyes
that
looked
at
you
,
perukes
flowing
over
*NL*
and
powdering
red-coated
shoulders
,
or
the
buckle
of
a
garter
above
a
*NL*
well-rounded
calf
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marquis
opened
the
drawing
room
door
;
one
of
the
ladies
-LRB-
the
*NL*
Marchioness
herself
-RRB-
came
to
meet
Emma
.
She
made
her
sit
down
by
her
on
*NL*
an
ottoman
,
and
began
talking
to
her
as
amicably
as
if
she
had
known
her
*NL*
a
long
time
.
She
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
,
with
fine
shoulders
,
a
hook
*NL*
nose
,
a
drawling
voice
,
and
on
this
evening
she
wore
over
her
brown
hair
*NL*
a
simple
guipure
fichu
that
fell
in
a
point
at
the
back
.
A
fair
young
*NL*
woman
sat
in
a
high-backed
chair
in
a
corner
;
and
gentlemen
with
flowers
*NL*
in
their
buttonholes
were
talking
to
ladies
round
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
dinner
was
served
.
The
men
,
who
were
in
the
majority
,
sat
down
*NL*
at
the
first
table
in
the
vestibule
;
the
ladies
at
the
second
in
the
*NL*
dining
room
with
the
Marquis
and
Marchioness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
on
entering
,
felt
herself
wrapped
round
by
the
warm
air
,
a
*NL*
blending
of
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
of
the
fine
linen
,
of
the
fumes
*NL*
of
the
viands
,
and
the
odour
of
the
truffles
.
The
silver
dish
covers
*NL*
reflected
the
lighted
wax
candles
in
the
candelabra
,
the
cut
crystal
*NL*
covered
with
light
steam
reflected
from
one
to
the
other
pale
rays
;
*NL*
bouquets
were
placed
in
a
row
the
whole
length
of
the
table
;
and
in
*NL*
the
large-bordered
plates
each
napkin
,
arranged
after
the
fashion
of
a
*NL*
bishop
's
mitre
,
held
between
its
two
gaping
folds
a
small
oval
shaped
*NL*
roll
.
The
red
claws
of
lobsters
hung
over
the
dishes
;
rich
fruit
in
open
*NL*
baskets
was
piled
up
on
moss
;
there
were
quails
in
their
plumage
;
smoke
*NL*
was
rising
;
and
in
silk
stockings
,
knee-breeches
,
white
cravat
,
and
*NL*
frilled
shirt
,
the
steward
,
grave
as
a
judge
,
offering
ready
carved
*NL*
dishes
between
the
shoulders
of
the
guests
,
with
a
touch
of
the
spoon
*NL*
gave
you
the
piece
chosen
.
On
the
large
stove
of
porcelain
inlaid
*NL*
with
copper
baguettes
the
statue
of
a
woman
,
draped
to
the
chin
,
gazed
*NL*
motionless
on
the
room
full
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
noticed
that
many
ladies
had
not
put
their
gloves
in
their
*NL*
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
alone
amongst
all
these
women
,
bent
*NL*
over
his
full
plate
,
and
his
napkin
tied
round
his
neck
like
a
child
,
an
*NL*
old
man
sat
eating
,
letting
drops
of
gravy
drip
from
his
mouth
.
His
eyes
*NL*
were
bloodshot
,
and
he
wore
a
little
queue
tied
with
black
ribbon
.
He
*NL*
was
the
Marquis
's
father-in-law
,
the
old
Duke
de
Laverdiere
,
once
on
*NL*
a
time
favourite
of
the
Count
d'Artois
,
in
the
days
of
the
Vaudreuil
*NL*
hunting-parties
at
the
Marquis
de
Conflans
'
,
and
had
been
,
it
was
said
,
*NL*
the
lover
of
Queen
Marie
Antoinette
,
between
Monsieur
de
Coigny
and
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Lauzun
.
He
had
lived
a
life
of
noisy
debauch
,
full
of
duels
,
*NL*
bets
,
elopements
;
he
had
squandered
his
fortune
and
frightened
all
his
*NL*
family
.
A
servant
behind
his
chair
named
aloud
to
him
in
his
ear
the
*NL*
dishes
that
he
pointed
to
stammering
,
and
constantly
Emma
's
eyes
*NL*
turned
involuntarily
to
this
old
man
with
hanging
lips
,
as
to
something
*NL*
extraordinary
.
He
had
lived
at
court
and
slept
in
the
bed
of
queens
!
*NL*
Iced
champagne
was
poured
out
.
Emma
shivered
all
over
as
she
felt
*NL*
it
cold
in
her
mouth
.
She
had
never
seen
pomegranates
nor
tasted
*NL*
pineapples
.
The
powdered
sugar
even
seemed
to
her
whiter
and
finer
than
*NL*
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
afterwards
went
to
their
rooms
to
prepare
for
the
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
made
her
toilet
with
the
fastidious
care
of
an
actress
on
her
*NL*
debut
.
She
did
her
hair
according
to
the
directions
of
the
hairdresser
,
*NL*
and
put
on
the
barege
dress
spread
out
upon
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
's
trousers
were
tight
across
the
belly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
trouser-straps
will
be
rather
awkward
for
dancing
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dancing
?
''
repeated
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
must
be
mad
!
They
would
make
fun
of
you
;
keep
your
place
.
*NL*
Besides
,
it
is
more
becoming
for
a
doctor
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
silent
.
He
walked
up
and
down
waiting
for
Emma
to
finish
*NL*
dressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
from
behind
in
the
glass
between
two
lights
.
Her
black
eyes
*NL*
seemed
blacker
than
ever
.
Her
hair
,
undulating
towards
the
ears
,
shone
*NL*
with
a
blue
lustre
;
a
rose
in
her
chignon
trembled
on
its
mobile
stalk
,
*NL*
with
artificial
dewdrops
on
the
tip
of
the
leaves
.
She
wore
a
gown
of
*NL*
pale
saffron
trimmed
with
three
bouquets
of
pompon
roses
mixed
with
*NL*
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
came
and
kissed
her
on
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
!
''
she
said
;
``
you
are
tumbling
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
could
hear
the
flourish
of
the
violin
and
the
notes
of
a
horn
.
She
*NL*
went
downstairs
restraining
herself
from
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dancing
had
begun
.
Guests
were
arriving
.
There
was
some
crushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
on
a
form
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quadrille
over
,
the
floor
was
occupied
by
groups
of
men
standing
up
*NL*
and
talking
and
servants
in
livery
bearing
large
trays
.
Along
the
line
*NL*
of
seated
women
painted
fans
were
fluttering
,
bouquets
half
hid
smiling
*NL*
faces
,
and
gold
stoppered
scent-bottles
were
turned
in
partly-closed
*NL*
hands
,
whose
white
gloves
outlined
the
nails
and
tightened
on
the
flesh
*NL*
at
the
wrists
.
Lace
trimmings
,
diamond
brooches
,
medallion
bracelets
*NL*
trembled
on
bodices
,
gleamed
on
breasts
,
clinked
on
bare
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hair
,
well-smoothed
over
the
temples
and
knotted
at
the
nape
,
*NL*
bore
crowns
,
or
bunches
,
or
sprays
of
mytosotis
,
jasmine
,
pomegranate
*NL*
blossoms
,
ears
of
corn
,
and
corn-flowers
.
Calmly
seated
in
their
places
,
*NL*
mothers
with
forbidding
countenances
were
wearing
red
turbans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
's
heart
beat
rather
faster
when
,
her
partner
holding
her
by
the
*NL*
tips
of
the
fingers
,
she
took
her
place
in
a
line
with
the
dancers
,
and
*NL*
waited
for
the
first
note
to
start
.
But
her
emotion
soon
vanished
,
and
,
*NL*
swaying
to
the
rhythm
of
the
orchestra
,
she
glided
forward
with
slight
*NL*
movements
of
the
neck
.
A
smile
rose
to
her
lips
at
certain
delicate
*NL*
phrases
of
the
violin
,
that
sometimes
played
alone
while
the
other
*NL*
instruments
were
silent
;
one
could
hear
the
clear
clink
of
the
louis
*NL*
d'or
that
were
being
thrown
down
upon
the
card
tables
in
the
next
room
;
*NL*
then
all
struck
again
,
the
cornet-a-piston
uttered
its
sonorous
note
,
*NL*
feet
marked
time
,
skirts
swelled
and
rustled
,
hands
touched
and
parted
;
*NL*
the
same
eyes
falling
before
you
met
yours
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
men
-LRB-
some
fifteen
or
so
-RRB-
,
of
twenty-five
to
forty
,
scattered
here
*NL*
and
there
among
the
dancers
or
talking
at
the
doorways
,
distinguished
*NL*
themselves
from
the
crowd
by
a
certain
air
of
breeding
,
whatever
their
*NL*
differences
in
age
,
dress
,
or
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
clothes
,
better
made
,
seemed
of
finer
cloth
,
and
their
hair
,
*NL*
brought
forward
in
curls
towards
the
temples
,
glossy
with
more
delicate
*NL*
pomades
.
They
had
the
complexion
of
wealth
--
that
clear
complexion
that
*NL*
is
heightened
by
the
pallor
of
porcelain
,
the
shimmer
of
satin
,
the
*NL*
veneer
of
old
furniture
,
and
that
an
ordered
regimen
of
exquisite
*NL*
nurture
maintains
at
its
best
.
Their
necks
moved
easily
in
their
low
*NL*
cravats
,
their
long
whiskers
fell
over
their
turned-down
collars
,
they
*NL*
wiped
their
lips
upon
handkerchiefs
with
embroidered
initials
that
gave
*NL*
forth
a
subtle
perfume
.
Those
who
were
beginning
to
grow
old
had
an
air
*NL*
of
youth
,
while
there
was
something
mature
in
the
faces
of
the
young
.
*NL*
In
their
unconcerned
looks
was
the
calm
of
passions
daily
satiated
,
and
*NL*
through
all
their
gentleness
of
manner
pierced
that
peculiar
brutality
,
*NL*
the
result
of
a
command
of
half-easy
things
,
in
which
force
is
exercised
*NL*
and
vanity
amused
--
the
management
of
thoroughbred
horses
and
the
society
*NL*
of
loose
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
steps
from
Emma
a
gentleman
in
a
blue
coat
was
talking
of
Italy
*NL*
with
a
pale
young
woman
wearing
a
parure
of
pearls
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
praising
the
breadth
of
the
columns
of
St.
Peter
's
,
Tivoly
,
*NL*
Vesuvius
,
Castellamare
,
and
Cassines
,
the
roses
of
Genoa
,
the
Coliseum
*NL*
by
moonlight
.
With
her
other
ear
Emma
was
listening
to
a
conversation
*NL*
full
of
words
she
did
not
understand
.
A
circle
gathered
round
a
very
*NL*
young
man
who
the
week
before
had
beaten
``
Miss
Arabella
''
and
``
Romolus
,
''
*NL*
and
won
two
thousand
louis
jumping
a
ditch
in
England
.
One
complained
*NL*
that
his
racehorses
were
growing
fat
;
another
of
the
printers
'
errors
*NL*
that
had
disfigured
the
name
of
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
atmosphere
of
the
ball
was
heavy
;
the
lamps
were
growing
dim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guests
were
flocking
to
the
billiard
room
.
A
servant
got
upon
a
chair
*NL*
and
broke
the
window-panes
.
At
the
crash
of
the
glass
Madame
Bovary
*NL*
turned
her
head
and
saw
in
the
garden
the
faces
of
peasants
pressed
*NL*
against
the
window
looking
in
at
them
.
Then
the
memory
of
the
Bertaux
*NL*
came
back
to
her
.
She
saw
the
farm
again
,
the
muddy
pond
,
her
father
in
*NL*
a
blouse
under
the
apple
trees
,
and
she
saw
herself
again
as
formerly
,
*NL*
skimming
with
her
finger
the
cream
off
the
milk-pans
in
the
dairy
.
But
*NL*
in
the
refulgence
of
the
present
hour
her
past
life
,
so
distinct
until
*NL*
then
,
faded
away
completely
,
and
she
almost
doubted
having
lived
it
.
She
*NL*
was
there
;
beyond
the
ball
was
only
shadow
overspreading
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
She
was
just
eating
a
maraschino
ice
that
she
held
with
her
left
hand
*NL*
in
a
silver-gilt
cup
,
her
eyes
half-closed
,
and
the
spoon
between
her
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lady
near
her
dropped
her
fan
.
A
gentlemen
was
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
be
so
good
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
as
to
pick
up
my
fan
that
has
*NL*
fallen
behind
the
sofa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
bowed
,
and
as
he
moved
to
stretch
out
his
arm
,
Emma
saw
*NL*
the
hand
of
a
young
woman
throw
something
white
,
folded
in
a
triangle
,
*NL*
into
his
hat
.
The
gentleman
,
picking
up
the
fan
,
offered
it
to
the
lady
*NL*
respectfully
;
she
thanked
him
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
,
and
began
*NL*
smelling
her
bouquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
,
where
were
plenty
of
Spanish
and
Rhine
wines
,
soups
a
la
*NL*
bisque
and
au
lait
d'amandes
*
,
puddings
a
la
Trafalgar
,
and
all
sorts
of
*NL*
cold
meats
with
jellies
that
trembled
in
the
dishes
,
the
carriages
one
*NL*
after
the
other
began
to
drive
off
.
Raising
the
corners
of
the
muslin
*NL*
curtain
,
one
could
see
the
light
of
their
lanterns
glimmering
through
*NL*
the
darkness
.
The
seats
began
to
empty
,
some
card-players
were
still
*NL*
left
;
the
musicians
were
cooling
the
tips
of
their
fingers
on
their
*NL*
tongues
.
Charles
was
half
asleep
,
his
back
propped
against
a
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
With
almond
milk
*NL*
*NL*
At
three
o'clock
the
cotillion
began
.
Emma
did
not
know
how
to
waltz
.
*NL*
Everyone
was
waltzing
,
Mademoiselle
d'Andervilliers
herself
and
the
*NL*
Marquis
;
only
the
guests
staying
at
the
castle
were
still
there
,
about
a
*NL*
dozen
persons
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
waltzers
,
however
,
who
was
familiarly
called
Viscount
,
and
*NL*
whose
low
cut
waistcoat
seemed
moulded
to
his
chest
,
came
a
second
time
*NL*
to
ask
Madame
Bovary
to
dance
,
assuring
her
that
he
would
guide
her
,
and
*NL*
that
she
would
get
through
it
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
slowly
,
then
went
more
rapidly
.
They
turned
;
all
around
them
*NL*
was
turning
--
the
lamps
,
the
furniture
,
the
wainscoting
,
the
floor
,
like
*NL*
a
disc
on
a
pivot
.
On
passing
near
the
doors
the
bottom
of
Emma
's
dress
*NL*
caught
against
his
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
legs
commingled
;
he
looked
down
at
her
;
she
raised
her
eyes
to
*NL*
his
.
A
torpor
seized
her
;
she
stopped
.
They
started
again
,
and
with
a
*NL*
more
rapid
movement
;
the
Viscount
,
dragging
her
along
disappeared
with
*NL*
her
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
,
where
panting
,
she
almost
fell
,
and
for
*NL*
a
moment
rested
her
head
upon
his
breast
.
And
then
,
still
turning
,
but
*NL*
more
slowly
,
he
guided
her
back
to
her
seat
.
She
leaned
back
against
the
*NL*
wall
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
opened
them
again
,
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
three
*NL*
waltzers
were
kneeling
before
a
lady
sitting
on
a
stool
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
chose
the
Viscount
,
and
the
violin
struck
up
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
looked
at
them
.
They
passed
and
re-passed
,
she
with
rigid
body
,
*NL*
her
chin
bent
down
,
and
he
always
in
the
same
pose
,
his
figure
curved
,
*NL*
his
elbow
rounded
,
his
chin
thrown
forward
.
That
woman
knew
how
to
*NL*
waltz
!
They
kept
up
a
long
time
,
and
tired
out
all
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
talked
a
few
moments
longer
,
and
after
the
goodnights
,
or
*NL*
rather
good
mornings
,
the
guests
of
the
chateau
retired
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
dragged
himself
up
by
the
balusters
.
His
``
knees
were
going
*NL*
up
into
his
body
.
''
He
had
spent
five
consecutive
hours
standing
*NL*
bolt
upright
at
the
card
tables
,
watching
them
play
whist
,
without
*NL*
understanding
anything
about
it
,
and
it
was
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
*NL*
that
he
pulled
off
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
threw
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
opened
the
window
,
and
leant
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
dark
;
some
drops
of
rain
were
falling
.
She
breathed
in
the
*NL*
damp
wind
that
refreshed
her
eyelids
.
The
music
of
the
ball
was
still
*NL*
murmuring
in
her
ears
.
And
she
tried
to
keep
herself
awake
in
order
to
*NL*
prolong
the
illusion
of
this
luxurious
life
that
she
would
soon
have
to
*NL*
give
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
began
to
break
.
She
looked
long
at
the
windows
of
the
chateau
,
*NL*
trying
to
guess
which
were
the
rooms
of
all
those
she
had
noticed
the
*NL*
evening
before
.
She
would
fain
have
known
their
lives
,
have
penetrated
,
*NL*
blended
with
them
.
But
she
was
shivering
with
cold
.
She
undressed
,
and
*NL*
cowered
down
between
the
sheets
against
Charles
,
who
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
great
many
people
to
luncheon
.
The
repast
lasted
ten
*NL*
minutes
;
no
liqueurs
were
served
,
which
astonished
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
Mademoiselle
d'Andervilliers
collected
some
pieces
of
roll
in
a
*NL*
small
basket
to
take
them
to
the
swans
on
the
ornamental
waters
,
and
*NL*
they
went
to
walk
in
the
hot-houses
,
where
strange
plants
,
bristling
*NL*
with
hairs
,
rose
in
pyramids
under
hanging
vases
,
whence
,
as
from
*NL*
over-filled
nests
of
serpents
,
fell
long
green
cords
interlacing
.
*NL*
The
orangery
,
which
was
at
the
other
end
,
led
by
a
covered
way
to
the
*NL*
outhouses
of
the
chateau
.
The
Marquis
,
to
amuse
the
young
woman
,
took
*NL*
her
to
see
the
stables
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
the
basket-shaped
racks
porcelain
slabs
bore
the
names
of
the
*NL*
horses
in
black
letters
.
Each
animal
in
its
stall
whisked
its
tail
when
*NL*
anyone
went
near
and
said
``
Tchk
!
tchk
!
''
The
boards
of
the
harness
room
*NL*
shone
like
the
flooring
of
a
drawing
room
.
The
carriage
harness
was
*NL*
piled
up
in
the
middle
against
two
twisted
columns
,
and
the
bits
,
the
*NL*
whips
,
the
spurs
,
the
curbs
,
were
ranged
in
a
line
all
along
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
meanwhile
,
went
to
ask
a
groom
to
put
his
horse
to
.
The
*NL*
dog-cart
was
brought
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
,
and
,
all
the
parcels
*NL*
being
crammed
in
,
the
Bovarys
paid
their
respects
to
the
Marquis
and
*NL*
Marchioness
and
set
out
again
for
Tostes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
watched
the
turning
wheels
in
silence
.
Charles
,
on
the
extreme
edge
*NL*
of
the
seat
,
held
the
reins
with
his
two
arms
wide
apart
,
and
the
little
*NL*
horse
ambled
along
in
the
shafts
that
were
too
big
for
him
.
The
loose
*NL*
reins
hanging
over
his
crupper
were
wet
with
foam
,
and
the
box
fastened
*NL*
on
behind
the
chaise
gave
great
regular
bumps
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
on
the
heights
of
Thibourville
when
suddenly
some
horsemen
*NL*
with
cigars
between
their
lips
passed
laughing
.
Emma
thought
she
*NL*
recognized
the
Viscount
,
turned
back
,
and
caught
on
the
horizon
only
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
heads
rising
or
falling
with
the
unequal
cadence
of
the
*NL*
trot
or
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mile
farther
on
they
had
to
stop
to
mend
with
some
string
the
traces
*NL*
that
had
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Charles
,
giving
a
last
look
to
the
harness
,
saw
something
on
the
*NL*
ground
between
his
horse
's
legs
,
and
he
picked
up
a
cigar-case
with
*NL*
a
green
silk
border
and
beblazoned
in
the
centre
like
the
door
of
a
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
even
two
cigars
in
it
,
''
said
he
;
``
they
'll
do
for
this
evening
*NL*
after
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
you
smoke
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
when
I
get
a
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
find
in
his
pocket
and
whipped
up
the
nag
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
home
the
dinner
was
not
ready
.
Madame
lost
her
temper
.
*NL*
Nastasie
answered
rudely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
room
!
''
said
Emma
.
``
You
are
forgetting
yourself
.
I
give
you
*NL*
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
dinner
there
was
onion
soup
and
a
piece
of
veal
with
sorrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
seated
opposite
Emma
,
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
it
is
to
be
at
home
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasie
could
be
heard
crying
.
He
was
rather
fond
of
the
poor
girl
.
*NL*
She
had
formerly
,
during
the
wearisome
time
of
his
widowhood
,
kept
him
*NL*
company
many
an
evening
.
She
had
been
his
first
patient
,
his
oldest
*NL*
acquaintance
in
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
given
her
warning
for
good
?
''
he
asked
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Who
is
to
prevent
me
?
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
warmed
themselves
in
the
kitchen
while
their
room
was
being
*NL*
made
ready
.
Charles
began
to
smoke
.
He
smoked
with
lips
protruding
,
*NL*
spitting
every
moment
,
recoiling
at
every
puff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
make
yourself
ill
,
''
she
said
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
down
his
cigar
and
ran
to
swallow
a
glass
of
cold
water
at
the
*NL*
pump
.
Emma
seizing
hold
of
the
cigar
case
threw
it
quickly
to
the
back
*NL*
of
the
cupboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
a
long
one
.
She
walked
about
her
little
garden
,
up
*NL*
and
down
the
same
walks
,
stopping
before
the
beds
,
before
the
espalier
,
*NL*
before
the
plaster
curate
,
looking
with
amazement
at
all
these
things
*NL*
of
once-on-a-time
that
she
knew
so
well
.
How
far
off
the
ball
seemed
*NL*
already
!
What
was
it
that
thus
set
so
far
asunder
the
morning
of
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
and
the
evening
of
to-day
?
Her
journey
to
Vaubyessard
*NL*
had
made
a
hole
in
her
life
,
like
one
of
those
great
crevices
that
*NL*
a
storm
will
sometimes
make
in
one
night
in
mountains
.
Still
she
was
*NL*
resigned
.
She
devoutly
put
away
in
her
drawers
her
beautiful
dress
,
down
*NL*
to
the
satin
shoes
whose
soles
were
yellowed
with
the
slippery
wax
of
*NL*
the
dancing
floor
.
Her
heart
was
like
these
.
In
its
friction
against
*NL*
wealth
something
had
come
over
it
that
could
not
be
effaced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
memory
of
this
ball
,
then
,
became
an
occupation
for
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
the
Wednesday
came
round
she
said
to
herself
as
she
awoke
,
``
Ah
!
*NL*
I
was
there
a
week
--
a
fortnight
--
three
weeks
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
little
by
little
the
faces
grew
confused
in
her
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
forgot
the
tune
of
the
quadrilles
;
she
no
longer
saw
the
liveries
*NL*
and
appointments
so
distinctly
;
some
details
escaped
her
,
but
the
regret
*NL*
remained
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Nine
*NL*
*NL*
Often
when
Charles
was
out
she
took
from
the
cupboard
,
between
the
*NL*
folds
of
the
linen
where
she
had
left
it
,
the
green
silk
cigar
case
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
it
,
opened
it
,
and
even
smelt
the
odour
of
the
lining
--
a
*NL*
mixture
of
verbena
and
tobacco
.
Whose
was
it
?
The
Viscount
's
?
Perhaps
*NL*
it
was
a
present
from
his
mistress
.
It
had
been
embroidered
on
some
*NL*
rosewood
frame
,
a
pretty
little
thing
,
hidden
from
all
eyes
,
that
had
*NL*
occupied
many
hours
,
and
over
which
had
fallen
the
soft
curls
of
the
*NL*
pensive
worker
.
A
breath
of
love
had
passed
over
the
stitches
on
the
*NL*
canvas
;
each
prick
of
the
needle
had
fixed
there
a
hope
or
a
memory
,
and
*NL*
all
those
interwoven
threads
of
silk
were
but
the
continuity
of
the
same
*NL*
silent
passion
.
And
then
one
morning
the
Viscount
had
taken
it
away
*NL*
with
him
.
Of
what
had
they
spoken
when
it
lay
upon
the
wide-mantelled
*NL*
chimneys
between
flower-vases
and
Pompadour
clocks
?
She
was
at
Tostes
;
*NL*
he
was
at
Paris
now
,
far
away
!
What
was
this
Paris
like
?
What
a
vague
*NL*
name
!
She
repeated
it
in
a
low
voice
,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
it
;
it
*NL*
rang
in
her
ears
like
a
great
cathedral
bell
;
it
shone
before
her
eyes
,
*NL*
even
on
the
labels
of
her
pomade-pots
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
,
when
the
carriers
passed
under
her
windows
in
their
carts
*NL*
singing
the
``
Marjolaine
,
''
she
awoke
,
and
listened
to
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
iron-bound
wheels
,
which
,
as
they
gained
the
country
road
,
was
soon
*NL*
deadened
by
the
soil
.
``
They
will
be
there
to-morrow
!
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
followed
them
in
thought
up
and
down
the
hills
,
traversing
*NL*
villages
,
gliding
along
the
highroads
by
the
light
of
the
stars
.
At
the
*NL*
end
of
some
indefinite
distance
there
was
always
a
confused
spot
,
into
*NL*
which
her
dream
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bought
a
plan
of
Paris
,
and
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
on
the
map
*NL*
she
walked
about
the
capital
.
She
went
up
the
boulevards
,
stopping
at
*NL*
every
turning
,
between
the
lines
of
the
streets
,
in
front
of
the
white
*NL*
squares
that
represented
the
houses
.
At
last
she
would
close
the
lids
of
*NL*
her
weary
eyes
,
and
see
in
the
darkness
the
gas
jets
flaring
in
the
wind
*NL*
and
the
steps
of
carriages
lowered
with
much
noise
before
the
peristyles
*NL*
of
theatres
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
in
``
La
Corbeille
,
''
a
lady
's
journal
,
and
the
``
Sylphe
des
*NL*
Salons
.
''
She
devoured
,
without
skipping
a
word
,
all
the
accounts
of
*NL*
first
nights
,
races
,
and
soirees
,
took
interest
in
the
debut
of
a
*NL*
singer
,
in
the
opening
of
a
new
shop
.
She
knew
the
latest
fashions
,
the
*NL*
addresses
of
the
best
tailors
,
the
days
of
the
Bois
and
the
Opera
.
In
*NL*
Eugene
Sue
she
studied
descriptions
of
furniture
;
she
read
Balzac
and
*NL*
George
Sand
,
seeking
in
them
imaginary
satisfaction
for
her
own
desires
.
*NL*
Even
at
table
she
had
her
book
by
her
,
and
turned
over
the
pages
*NL*
while
Charles
ate
and
talked
to
her
.
The
memory
of
the
Viscount
always
*NL*
returned
as
she
read
.
Between
him
and
the
imaginary
personages
she
made
*NL*
comparisons
.
But
the
circle
of
which
he
was
the
centre
gradually
widened
*NL*
round
him
,
and
the
aureole
that
he
bore
,
fading
from
his
form
,
broadened
*NL*
out
beyond
,
lighting
up
her
other
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
,
more
vague
than
the
ocean
,
glimmered
before
Emma
's
eyes
in
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
vermilion
.
The
many
lives
that
stirred
amid
this
tumult
*NL*
were
,
however
,
divided
into
parts
,
classed
as
distinct
pictures
.
Emma
*NL*
perceived
only
two
or
three
that
hid
from
her
all
the
rest
,
and
in
*NL*
themselves
represented
all
humanity
.
The
world
of
ambassadors
moved
over
*NL*
polished
floors
in
drawing
rooms
lined
with
mirrors
,
round
oval
tables
*NL*
covered
with
velvet
and
gold-fringed
cloths
.
There
were
dresses
with
*NL*
trains
,
deep
mysteries
,
anguish
hidden
beneath
smiles
.
Then
came
the
*NL*
society
of
the
duchesses
;
all
were
pale
;
all
got
up
at
four
o'clock
;
the
*NL*
women
,
poor
angels
,
wore
English
point
on
their
petticoats
;
and
the
men
,
*NL*
unappreciated
geniuses
under
a
frivolous
outward
seeming
,
rode
horses
to
*NL*
death
at
pleasure
parties
,
spent
the
summer
season
at
Baden
,
and
towards
*NL*
the
forties
married
heiresses
.
In
the
private
rooms
of
restaurants
,
*NL*
where
one
sups
after
midnight
by
the
light
of
wax
candles
,
laughed
the
*NL*
motley
crowd
of
men
of
letters
and
actresses
.
They
were
prodigal
as
*NL*
kings
,
full
of
ideal
,
ambitious
,
fantastic
frenzy
.
This
was
an
existence
*NL*
outside
that
of
all
others
,
between
heaven
and
earth
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
storms
,
having
something
of
the
sublime
.
For
the
rest
of
the
world
it
*NL*
was
lost
,
with
no
particular
place
and
as
if
non-existent
.
The
nearer
*NL*
things
were
,
moreover
,
the
more
her
thoughts
turned
away
from
them
.
*NL*
All
her
immediate
surroundings
,
the
wearisome
country
,
the
middle-class
*NL*
imbeciles
,
the
mediocrity
of
existence
,
seemed
to
her
exceptional
,
a
*NL*
peculiar
chance
that
had
caught
hold
of
her
,
while
beyond
stretched
,
as
*NL*
far
as
eye
could
see
,
an
immense
land
of
joys
and
passions
.
She
confused
*NL*
in
her

The
lad
from
the
posting
house
who
came
to
groom
the
mare
every
morning
*NL*
passed
through
the
passage
with
his
heavy
wooden
shoes
;
there
were
holes
*NL*
in
his
blouse
;
his
feet
were
bare
in
list
slippers
.
And
this
was
the
*NL*
groom
in
knee-britches
with
whom
she
had
to
be
content
!
His
work
done
,
*NL*
he
did
not

for
Charles
on
his

put
up
*NL*
his
horse
himself
,
unsaddled
him
and
put
on

halter
,
while
the
*NL*
servant-girl
brought
a
bundle
of
straw
and
threw
it
as
best
she
could
*NL*
into
the
manger

Emma
*NL*
took
into
her
service
a
young
girl
of
fourteen
,
an
orphan
with
a
sweet
*NL*
face
.
She
forbade
her
wearing
cotton
caps
,
taught
her
to
address
her
in
*NL*
the
third
person
,
to
bring
a
glass
of
water
on
a
plate
,
to
knock
before
*NL*
coming
into
a
room
,
to
iron
,
starch
,
and
to
dress
her
--
wanted
to
make
a
*NL*
lady
's
-
maid
of
her
.
The
new
servant
obeyed
without
a
murmur
,
so
as
not
*NL*
to
be
sent
away
;
and
as
madame
usually
left
the
key
in
the
sideboard
,
*NL*
Felicite
every
evening
took
a
small
supply
of
sugar
that
she
ate
alone
*NL*
in
her
bed
after
she
had
said
her
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
in
the
afternoon
she
went
to
chat
with
the
postilions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
was
in
her
room
upstairs
.
She
wore
an
open
dressing
gown
that
*NL*
showed
between
the
shawl
facings
of
her
bodice
a
pleated
chamisette
with
*NL*
three
gold
buttons
.
Her
belt
was
a
corded
girdle
with
great
tassels
,
and
*NL*
her
small
garnet
coloured
slippers
had
a
large
knot
of
ribbon
that
fell
*NL*
over
her
instep
.
She
had
bought
herself
a
blotting
book
,
writing
case
,
*NL*
pen-holder
,
and
envelopes
,
although
she
had
no
one
to
write
to
;
she
*NL*
dusted
her
what-not
,
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
,
picked
up
a
book
,
*NL*
and
then
,
dreaming
between
the
lines
,
let
it
drop
on
her
knees
.
She
*NL*
longed
to
travel
or
to
go
back
to
her
convent
.
She
wished
at
the
same
*NL*
time
to
die
and
to
live
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
in
snow
and
rain
trotted
across
country
.
He
ate
omelettes
on
*NL*
farmhouse
tables
,
poked
his
arm
into
damp
beds
,
received
the
tepid
*NL*
spurt
of
blood-lettings
in
his
face
,
listened
to
death-rattles
,
examined
*NL*
basins
,
turned
over
a
good
deal
of
dirty
linen
;
but
every
evening
he
*NL*
found
a
blazing
fire
,
his
dinner
ready
,
easy-chairs
,
and
a
well-dressed
*NL*
woman
,
charming
with
an
odour
of
freshness
,
though
no
one
could
say
*NL*
whence
the
perfume
came
,
or
if
it
were
not
her
skin
that
made
odorous
*NL*
her
chemise
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
charmed
him
by
numerous
attentions
;
now
it
was
some
new
way
of
*NL*
arranging
paper
sconces
for
the
candles
,
a
flounce
that
she
altered
on
*NL*
her
gown
,
or
an
extraordinary
name
for
some
very
simple
dish
that
the
*NL*
servant
had
spoilt
,
but
that
Charles
swallowed
with
pleasure
to
the
last
*NL*
mouthful
.
At
Rouen
she
saw
some
ladies
who
wore
a
bunch
of
charms
on
the
*NL*
watch-chains
;
she
bought
some
charms
.
She
wanted
for
her
mantelpiece
two
*NL*
large
blue
glass
vases
,
and
some
time
after
an
ivory
necessaire
with
a
*NL*
silver-gilt
thimble
.
The
less
Charles
understood
these
refinements
*NL*
the
more
they
seduced
him
.
They
added
something
to
the
pleasure
of
the
*NL*
senses
and
to
the
comfort
of
his
fireside
.
It
was
like
a
golden
dust
*NL*
sanding
all
along
the
narrow
path
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
well
,
looked
well
;
his
reputation
was
firmly
established
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
country-folk
loved
him
because
he
was
not
proud
.
He
petted
the
*NL*
children
,
never
went
to
the
public
house
,
and
,
moreover
,
his
morals
*NL*
inspired
confidence
.
He
was
specially
successful
with
catarrhs
and
chest
*NL*
complaints
.
Being
much
afraid
of
killing
his
patients
,
Charles
,
in
fact
*NL*
only
prescribed
sedatives
,
from
time
to
time
and
emetic
,
a
footbath
,
*NL*
or
leeches
.
It
was
not
that
he
was
afraid
of
surgery
;
he
bled
people
*NL*
copiously
like
horses
,
and
for
the
taking
out
of
teeth
he
had
the
*NL*
``
devil
's
own
wrist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
to
keep
up
with
the
times
,
he
took
in
``
La
Ruche
Medicale
,
''
*NL*
a
new
journal
whose
prospectus
had
been
sent
him
.
He
read
it
a
little
*NL*
after
dinner
,
but
in
about
five
minutes
the
warmth
of
the
room
added
to
*NL*
the
effect
of
his
dinner
sent
him
to
sleep
;
and
he
sat
there
,
his
chin
*NL*
on
his
two
hands
and
his
hair
spreading
like
a
mane
to
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
lamp
.
Emma
looked
at
him
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
Why
,
at
least
,
was
*NL*
not
her
husband
one
of
those
men
of
taciturn
passions
who
work
at
their
*NL*
books
all
night
,
and
at
last
,
when
about
sixty
,
the
age
of
rheumatism
*NL*
sets
in
,
wear
a
string
of
orders
on
their
ill-fitting
black
coat
?
*NL*
She
could
have
wished
this
name
of
Bovary
,
which
was
hers
,
had
been
*NL*
illustrious
,
to
see
it
displayed
at
the
booksellers
'
,
repeated
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
,
known
to
all
France
.
But
Charles
had
no
ambition
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
Yvetot
doctor
whom
he
had
lately
met
in
consultation
had
somewhat
*NL*
humiliated
him
at
the
very
bedside
of
the
patient
,
before
the
assembled
*NL*
relatives
.
When
,
in
the
evening
,
Charles
told
her
this
anecdote
,
Emma
*NL*
inveighed
loudly
against
his
colleague
.
Charles
was
much
touched
.
He
*NL*
kissed
her
forehead
with
a
tear
in
his
eyes
.
But
she
was
angered
with
*NL*
shame
;
she
felt
a
wild
desire
to
strike
him
;
she
went
to
open
the
window
*NL*
in
the
passage
and
breathed
in
the
fresh
air
to
calm
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
man
!
What
a
man
!
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
biting
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
she
was
becoming
more
irritated
with
him
.
As
he
grew
older
his
*NL*
manner
grew
heavier
;
at
dessert
he
cut
the
corks
of
the
empty
bottles
;
*NL*
after
eating
he
cleaned
his
teeth
with
his
tongue
;
in
taking
soup
*NL*
he
made
a
gurgling
noise
with
every
spoonful
;
and
,
as
he
was
getting
*NL*
fatter
,
the
puffed-out
cheeks
seemed
to
push
the
eyes
,
always
small
,
up
*NL*
to
the
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
Emma
tucked
the
red
borders
of
his
under-vest
unto
his
*NL*
waistcoat
,
rearranged
his
cravat
,
and
threw
away
the
dirty
gloves
he
was
*NL*
going
to
put
on
;
and
this
was
not
,
as
he
fancied
,
for
himself
;
it
*NL*
was
for
herself
,
by
a
diffusion
of
egotism
,
of
nervous
irritation
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
too
,
she
told
him
of
what
she
had
read
,
such
as
a
passage
in
*NL*
a
novel
,
of
a
new
play
,
or
an
anecdote
of
the
``
upper
ten
''
that
she
*NL*
had
seen
in
a
feuilleton
;
for
,
after
all
,
Charles
was
something
,
an
*NL*
ever-open
ear
,
and
ever-ready
approbation
.
She
confided
many
a
thing
to
*NL*
her
greyhound
.
She
would
have
done
so
to
the
logs
in
the
fireplace
or
to
*NL*
the
pendulum
of
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
however
,
she
was
waiting
for
something
to
*NL*
happen
.
Like
shipwrecked
sailors
,
she
turned
despairing
eyes
upon
the
*NL*
solitude
of
her
life
,
seeking
afar
off
some
white
sail
in
the
mists
of
*NL*
the
horizon
.
She
did
not
know
what
this
chance
would
be
,
what
wind
would
*NL*
bring
it
her
,
towards
what
shore
it
would
drive
her
,
if
it
would
be
a
*NL*
shallop
or
a
three-decker
,
laden
with
anguish
or
full
of
bliss
to
the
*NL*
portholes
.
But
each
morning
,
as
she
awoke
,
she
hoped
it
would
come
that
*NL*
day
;
she
listened
to
every
sound
,
sprang
up
with
a
start
,
wondered
that
*NL*
it
did
not
come
;
then
at
sunset
,
always
more
saddened
,
she
longed
for
*NL*
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
came
round
.
With
the
first
warm
weather
,
when
the
pear
trees
*NL*
began
to
blossom
,
she
suffered
from
dyspnoea
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
beginning
of
July
she
counted
how
many
weeks
there
were
to
*NL*
October
,
thinking
that
perhaps
the
Marquis
d'Andervilliers
would
give
*NL*
another
ball
at
Vaubyessard
.
But
all
September
passed
without
letters
or
*NL*
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
ennui
of
this
disappointment
her
heart
once
more
remained
*NL*
empty
,
and
then
the
same
series
of
days
recommenced
.
So
now
they
would
*NL*
thus
follow
one
another
,
always
the
same
,
immovable
,
and
bringing
*NL*
nothing
.
Other
lives
,
however
flat
,
had
at
least
the
chance
of
some
*NL*
event
.
One
adventure
sometimes
brought
with
it
infinite
consequences
and
*NL*
the
scene
changed
.
But
nothing
happened
to
her
;
God
had
willed
it
so
!
*NL*
The
future
was
a
dark
corridor
,
with
its
door
at
the
end
shut
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
up
music
.
What
was
the
good
of
playing
?
Who
would
hear
her
?
*NL*
Since
she
could
never
,
in
a
velvet
gown
with
short
sleeves
,
striking
*NL*
with
her
light
fingers
the
ivory
keys
of
an
Erard
at
a
concert
,
feel
*NL*
the
murmur
of
ecstasy
envelop
her
like
a
breeze
,
it
was
not
worth
while
*NL*
boring
herself
with
practicing
.
Her
drawing
cardboard
and
her
embroidery
*NL*
she
left
in
the
cupboard
.
What
was
the
good
?
What
was
the
good
?
Sewing
*NL*
irritated
her
.
``
I
have
read
everything
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
And
she
*NL*
sat
there
making
the
tongs
red-hot
,
or
looked
at
the
rain
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
sad
she
was
on
Sundays
when
vespers
sounded
!
She
listened
with
dull
*NL*
attention
to
each
stroke
of
the
cracked
bell
.
A
cat
slowly
walking
over
*NL*
some
roof
put
up
his
back
in
the
pale
rays
of
the
sun
.
The
wind
on
the
*NL*
highroad
blew
up
clouds
of
dust
.
Afar
off
a
dog
sometimes
howled
;
and
*NL*
the
bell
,
keeping
time
,
continued
its
monotonous
ringing
that
died
away
*NL*
over
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
people
came
out
from
church
.
The
women
in
waxed
clogs
,
the
*NL*
peasants
in
new
blouses
,
the
little
bare-headed
children
skipping
along
*NL*
in
front
of
them
,
all
were
going
home
.
And
till
nightfall
,
five
or
six
*NL*
men
,
always
the
same
,
stayed
playing
at
corks
in
front
of
the
large
door
*NL*
of
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
was
severe
.
The
windows
every
morning
were
covered
with
*NL*
rime
,
and
the
light
shining
through
them
,
dim
as
through
ground-glass
,
*NL*
sometimes
did
not
change
the
whole
day
long
.
At
four
o'clock
the
lamp
*NL*
had
to
be
lighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
fine
days
she
went
down
into
the
garden
.
The
dew
had
left
on
the
*NL*
cabbages
a
silver
lace
with
long
transparent
threads
spreading
from
one
*NL*
to
the
other
.
No
birds
were
to
be
heard
;
everything
seemed
asleep
,
the
*NL*
espalier
covered
with
straw
,
and
the
vine
,
like
a
great
sick
serpent
*NL*
under
the
coping
of
the
wall
,
along
which
,
on
drawing
near
,
one
saw
the
*NL*
many-footed
woodlice
crawling
.
Under
the
spruce
by
the
hedgerow
,
the
*NL*
curie
in
the
three-cornered
hat
reading
his
breviary
had
lost
his
right
*NL*
foot
,
and
the
very
plaster
,
scaling
off
with
the
frost
,
had
left
white
*NL*
scabs
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
went
up
again
,
shut
her
door
,
put
on
coals
,
and
fainting
with
*NL*
the
heat
of
the
hearth
,
felt
her
boredom
weigh
more
heavily
than
ever
.
*NL*
She
would
have
liked
to
go
down
and
talk
to
the
servant
,
but
a
sense
of
*NL*
shame
restrained
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
at
the
same
time
the
schoolmaster
in
a
black
skullcap
opened
*NL*
the
shutters
of
his
house
,
and
the
rural
policeman
,
wearing
his
sabre
*NL*
over
his
blouse
,
passed
by
.
Night
and
morning
the
post-horses
,
three
by
*NL*
three
,
crossed
the
street
to
water
at
the
pond
.
From
time
to
time
the
*NL*
bell
of
a
public
house
door
rang
,
and
when
it
was
windy
one
could
hear
*NL*
the
little
brass
basins
that
served
as
signs
for
the
hairdresser
's
shop
*NL*
creaking
on
their
two
rods
.
This
shop
had
as
decoration
an
old
engraving
*NL*
of
a
fashion-plate
stuck
against
a
windowpane
and
the
wax
bust
of
a
*NL*
woman
with
yellow
hair
.
He
,
too
,
the
hairdresser
,
lamented
his
wasted
*NL*
calling
,
his
hopeless
future
,
and
dreaming
of
some
shop
in
a
big
*NL*
town
--
at
Rouen
,
for
example
,
overlooking
the
harbour
,
near
the
*NL*
theatre
--
he
walked
up
and
down
all
day
from
the
mairie
to
the
church
,
*NL*
sombre
and
waiting
for
customers
.
When
Madame
Bovary
looked
up
,
she
*NL*
always
saw
him
there
,
like
a
sentinel
on
duty
,
with
his
skullcap
over
*NL*
his
ears
and
his
vest
of
lasting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
in
the
afternoon
outside
the
window
of
her
room
,
the
head
of
a
*NL*
man
appeared
,
a
swarthy
head
with
black
whiskers
,
smiling
slowly
,
with
*NL*
a
broad
,
gentle
smile
that
showed
his
white
teeth
.
A
waltz
immediately
*NL*
began
and
on
the
organ
,
in
a
little
drawing
room
,
dancers
the
size
of
*NL*
a
finger
,
women
in
pink
turbans
,
Tyrolians
in
jackets
,
monkeys
in
frock
*NL*
coats
,
gentlemen
in
knee-breeches
,
turned
and
turned
between
the
sofas
,
*NL*
the
consoles
,
multiplied
in
the
bits
of
looking
glass
held
together
*NL*
at
their
corners
by
a
piece
of
gold
paper
.
The
man
turned
his
handle
,
*NL*
looking
to
the
right
and
left
,
and
up
at
the
windows
.
Now
and
again
,
*NL*
while
he
shot
out
a
long
squirt
of
brown
saliva
against
the
milestone
,
*NL*
with
his
knee
raised
his
instrument
,
whose
hard
straps
tired
his
*NL*
shoulder
;
and
now
,
doleful
and
drawling
,
or
gay
and
hurried
,
the
music
*NL*
escaped
from
the
box
,
droning
through
a
curtain
of
pink
taffeta
under
*NL*
a
brass
claw
in
arabesque
.
They
were
airs
played
in
other
places
at
*NL*
the
theatres
,
sung
in
drawing
rooms
,
danced
to
at
night
under
lighted
*NL*
lustres
,
echoes
of
the
world
that
reached
even
to
Emma
.
Endless
*NL*
sarabands
ran
through
her
head
,
and
,
like
an
Indian
dancing
girl
on
the
*NL*
flowers
of
a
carpet
,
her
thoughts
leapt
with
the
notes
,
swung
from
dream
*NL*
to
dream
,
from
sadness
to
sadness
.
When
the
man
had
caught
some
coppers
*NL*
in
his
cap
,
he
drew
down
an
old
cover
of
blue
cloth
,
hitched
his
organ
*NL*
on
to
his
back
,
and
went
off
with
a
heavy
tread
.
She
watched
him
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
above
all
the
meal-times
that
were
unbearable
to
her
,
in
this
*NL*
small
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
with
its
smoking
stove
,
its
creaking
*NL*
door
,
the
walls
that
sweated
,
the
damp
flags
;
all
the
bitterness
in
life
*NL*
seemed
served
up
on
her
plate
,
and
with
smoke
of
the
boiled
beef
there
*NL*
rose
from
her
secret
soul
whiffs
of
sickliness
.
Charles
was
a
slow
*NL*
eater
;
she
played
with
a
few
nuts
,
or
,
leaning
on
her
elbow
,
amused
*NL*
herself
with
drawing
lines
along
the
oilcloth
table
cover
with
the
point
*NL*
of
her
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
let
everything
in
her
household
take
care
of
itself
,
and
Madame
*NL*
Bovary
senior
,
when
she
came
to
spend
part
of
Lent
at
Tostes
,
was
much
*NL*
surprised
at
the
change
.
She
who
was
formerly
so
careful
,
so
dainty
,
*NL*
now
passed
whole
days
without
dressing
,
wore
grey
cotton
stockings
,
and
*NL*
burnt
tallow
candles
.
She
kept
saying
they
must
be
economical
since
*NL*
they
were
not
rich
,
adding
that
she
was
very
contented
,
very
happy
,
that
*NL*
Tostes
pleased
her
very
much
,
with
other
speeches
that
closed
the
mouth
*NL*
of
her
mother-in-law
.
Besides
,
Emma
no
longer
seemed
inclined
to
follow
*NL*
her
advice
;
once
even
,
Madame
Bovary
having
thought
fit
to
maintain
that
*NL*
mistresses
ought
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
religion
of
their
servants
,
she
*NL*
had
answered
with
so
angry
a
look
and
so
cold
a
smile
that
the
good
*NL*
woman
did
not
interfere
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
growing
difficult
,
capricious
.
She
ordered
dishes
for
herself
,
*NL*
then
she
did
not
touch
them
;
one
day
drank
only
pure
milk
,
the
next
*NL*
cups
of
tea
by
the
dozen
.
Often
she
persisted
in
not
going
out
,
then
,
*NL*
stifling
,
threw
open
the
windows
and
put
on
light
dresses
.
After
she
had
*NL*
well
scolded
her
servant
she
gave
her
presents
or
sent
her
out
to
see
*NL*
neighbours
,
just
as
she
sometimes
threw
beggars
all
the
silver
in
her
*NL*
purse
,
although
she
was
by
no
means
tender-hearted
or
easily
accessible
*NL*
to
the
feelings
of
others
,
like
most
country-bred
people
,
who
always
*NL*
retain
in
their
souls
something
of
the
horny
hardness
of
the
paternal
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
February
old
Rouault
,
in
memory
of
his
cure
,
himself
*NL*
brought
his
son-in-law
a
superb
turkey
,
and
stayed
three
days
at
Tostes
.
*NL*
Charles
being
with
his
patients
,
Emma
kept
him
company
.
He
smoked
in
the
*NL*
room
,
spat
on
the
firedogs
,
talked
farming
,
calves
,
cows
,
poultry
,
and
*NL*
municipal
council
,
so
that
when
he
left
she
closed
the
door
on
him
with
*NL*
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
that
surprised
even
herself
.
Moreover
she
no
*NL*
longer
concealed
her
contempt
for
anything
or
anybody
,
and
at
times
she
*NL*
set
herself
to
express
singular
opinions
,
finding
fault
with
that
which
*NL*
others
approved
,
and
approving
things
perverse
and
immoral
,
all
of
which
*NL*
made
her
husband
open
his
eyes
widely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
this
misery
last
for
ever
?
Would
she
never
issue
from
it
?
Yet
*NL*
she
was
as
good
as
all
the
women
who
were
living
happily
.
She
had
seen
*NL*
duchesses
at
Vaubyessard
with
clumsier
waists
and
commoner
ways
,
and
she
*NL*
execrated
the
injustice
of
God
.
She
leant
her
head
against
the
walls
*NL*
to
weep
;
she
envied
lives
of
stir
;
longed
for
masked
balls
,
for
violent
*NL*
pleasures
,
with
all
the
wildness
that
she
did
not
know
,
but
that
these
*NL*
must
surely
yield
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
grew
pale
and
suffered
from
palpitations
of
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
prescribed
valerian
and
camphor
baths
.
Everything
that
was
tried
*NL*
only
seemed
to
irritate
her
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
days
she
chatted
with
feverish
rapidity
,
and
this
*NL*
over-excitement
was
suddenly
followed
by
a
state
of
torpor
,
in
which
*NL*
she
remained
without
speaking
,
without
moving
.
What
then
revived
her
was
*NL*
pouring
a
bottle
of
eau-de-cologne
over
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
constantly
complaining
about
Tostes
,
Charles
fancied
that
her
*NL*
illness
was
no
doubt
due
to
some
local
cause
,
and
fixing
on
this
idea
,
*NL*
began
to
think
seriously
of
setting
up
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
she
drank
vinegar
,
contracted
a
sharp
little
cough
,
and
*NL*
completely
lost
her
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
cost
Charles
much
to
give
up
Tostes
after
living
there
four
years
and
*NL*
``
when
he
was
beginning
to
get
on
there
.
''
Yet
if
it
must
be
!
He
took
her
*NL*
to
Rouen
to
see
his
old
master
.
It
was
a
nervous
complaint
:
change
of
*NL*
air
was
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
looking
about
him
on
this
side
and
on
that
,
Charles
learnt
that
*NL*
in
the
Neufchatel
arrondissement
there
was
a
considerable
market
town
*NL*
called
Yonville-l'Abbaye
,
whose
doctor
,
a
Polish
refugee
,
had
decamped
a
*NL*
week
before
.
Then
he
wrote
to
the
chemist
of
the
place
to
ask
the
*NL*
number
of
the
population
,
the
distance
from
the
nearest
doctor
,
what
*NL*
his
predecessor
had
made
a
year
,
and
so
forth
;
and
the
answer
being
*NL*
satisfactory
,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
move
towards
the
spring
,
if
Emma
's
*NL*
health
did
not
improve
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
,
in
view
of
her
departure
,
she
was
tidying
a
drawer
,
*NL*
something
pricked
her
finger
.
It
was
a
wire
of
her
wedding
bouquet
.
*NL*
The
orange
blossoms
were
yellow
with
dust
and
the
silver
bordered
satin
*NL*
ribbons
frayed
at
the
edges
.
She
threw
it
into
the
fire
.
It
flared
*NL*
up
more
quickly
than
dry
straw
.
Then
it
was
,
like
a
red
bush
in
the
*NL*
cinders
,
slowly
devoured
.
She
watched
it
burn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
pasteboard
berries
burst
,
the
wire
twisted
,
the
gold
*NL*
lace
melted
;
and
the
shriveled
paper
corollas
,
fluttering
like
black
*NL*
butterflies
at
the
back
of
the
stove
,
at
last
flew
up
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
left
Tostes
at
the
month
of
March
,
Madame
Bovary
was
pregnant
.

Yonville-l'Abbaye
-LRB-
so
called
from
an
old
Capuchin
abbey
of
which
not
*NL*
even
the
ruins
remain
-RRB-
is
a
market-town
twenty-four
miles
from
Rouen
,
*NL*
between
the
Abbeville
and
Beauvais
roads
,
at
the
foot
of
a
valley
*NL*
watered
by
the
Rieule
,
a
little
river
that
runs
into
the
Andelle
after
*NL*
turning
three
water-mills
near
its
mouth
,
where
there
are
a
few
trout
*NL*
that
the
lads
amuse
themselves
by
fishing
for
on
Sundays
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
leave
the
highroad
at
La
Boissiere
and
keep
straight
on
to
the
top
of
*NL*
the
Leux
hill
,
whence
the
valley
is
seen
.
The
river
that
runs
through
it
*NL*
makes
of
it
,
as
it
were
,
two
regions
with
distinct
physiognomies
--
all
on
*NL*
the
left
is
pasture
land
,
all
of
the
right
arable
.
The
meadow
stretches
*NL*
under
a
bulge
of
low
hills
to
join
at
the
back
with
the
pasture
land
of
*NL*
the
Bray
country
,
while
on
the
eastern
side
,
the
plain
,
gently
rising
,
*NL*
broadens
out
,
showing
as
far
as
eye
can
follow
its
blond
cornfields
.
The
*NL*
water
,
flowing
by
the
grass
,
divides
with
a
white
line
the
colour
of
the
*NL*
roads
and
of
the
plains
,
and
the
country
is
like
a
great
unfolded
mantle
*NL*
with
a
green
velvet
cape
bordered
with
a
fringe
of
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
us
,
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
,
lie
the
oaks
of
the
forest
of
*NL*
Argueil
,
with
the
steeps
of
the
Saint-Jean
hills
scarred
from
top
*NL*
to
bottom
with
red
irregular
lines
;
they
are
rain
tracks
,
and
these
*NL*
brick-tones
standing
out
in
narrow
streaks
against
the
grey
colour
of
*NL*
the
mountain
are
due
to
the
quantity
of
iron
springs
that
flow
beyond
in
*NL*
the
neighboring
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
are
on
the
confines
of
Normandy
,
Picardy
,
and
the
Ile-de-France
,
*NL*
a
bastard
land
whose
language
is
without
accent
and
its
landscape
is
*NL*
without
character
.
It
is
there
that
they
make
the
worst
Neufchatel
*NL*
cheeses
of
all
the
arrondissement
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
farming
is
*NL*
costly
because
so
much
manure
is
needed
to
enrich
this
friable
soil
full
*NL*
of
sand
and
flints
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
1835
there
was
no
practicable
road
for
getting
to
Yonville
,
but
*NL*
about
this
time
a
cross-road
was
made
which
joins
that
of
Abbeville
to
*NL*
that
of
Amiens
,
and
is
occasionally
used
by
the
Rouen
wagoners
on
their
*NL*
way
to
Flanders
.
Yonville-l'Abbaye
has
remained
stationary
in
spite
of
*NL*
its
``
new
outlet
.
''
Instead
of
improving
the
soil
,
they
persist
in
keeping
*NL*
up
the
pasture
lands
,
however
depreciated
they
may
be
in
value
,
and
*NL*
the
lazy
borough
,
growing
away
from
the
plain
,
has
naturally
spread
*NL*
riverwards
.
It
is
seem
from
afar
sprawling
along
the
banks
like
a
*NL*
cowherd
taking
a
siesta
by
the
water-side
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
beyond
the
bridge
begins
a
roadway
,
planted
with
*NL*
young
aspens
,
that
leads
in
a
straight
line
to
the
first
houses
in
the
*NL*
place
.
These
,
fenced
in
by
hedges
,
are
in
the
middle
of
courtyards
*NL*
full
of
straggling
buildings
,
wine-presses
,
cart-sheds
and
distilleries
*NL*
scattered
under
thick
trees
,
with
ladders
,
poles
,
or
scythes
hung
on
to
*NL*
the
branches
.
The
thatched
roofs
,
like
fur
caps
drawn
over
eyes
,
reach
*NL*
down
over
about
a
third
of
the
low
windows
,
whose
coarse
convex
glasses
*NL*
have
knots
in
the
middle
like
the
bottoms
of
bottles
.
Against
the
*NL*
plaster
wall
diagonally
crossed
by
black
joists
,
a
meagre
pear-tree
*NL*
sometimes
leans
and
the
ground-floors
have
at
their
door
a
small
*NL*
swing-gate
to
keep
out
the
chicks
that
come
pilfering
crumbs
of
bread
*NL*
steeped
in
cider
on
the
threshold
.
But
the
courtyards
grow
narrower
,
*NL*
the
houses
closer
together
,
and
the
fences
disappear
;
a
bundle
of
*NL*
ferns
swings
under
a
window
from
the
end
of
a
broomstick
;
there
is
a
*NL*
blacksmith
's
forge
and
then
a
wheelwright
's
,
with
two
or
three
new
carts
*NL*
outside
that
partly
block
the
way
.
Then
across
an
open
space
appears
a
*NL*
white
house
beyond
a
grass
mound
ornamented
by
a
Cupid
,
his
finger
*NL*
on
his
lips
;
two
brass
vases
are
at
each
end
of
a
flight
of
steps
;
*NL*
scutcheons
*
blaze
upon
the
door
.
It
is
the
notary
's
house
,
and
the
*NL*
finest
in
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
panonceaux
that
have
to
be
hung
over
the
doors
of
*NL*
notaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Church
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
twenty
paces
farther
*NL*
down
,
at
the
entrance
of
the
square
.
The
little
cemetery
that
surrounds
*NL*
it
,
closed
in
by
a
wall
breast
high
,
is
so
full
of
graves
that
the
old
*NL*
stones
,
level
with
the
ground
,
form
a
continuous
pavement
,
on
which
the
*NL*
grass
of
itself
has
marked
out
regular
green
squares
.
The
church
was
*NL*
rebuilt
during
the
last
years
of
the
reign
of
Charles
X
.
The
wooden
roof
*NL*
is
beginning
to
rot
from
the
top
,
and
here
and
there
has
black
hollows
*NL*
in
its
blue
colour
.
Over
the
door
,
where
the
organ
should
be
,
is
a
*NL*
loft
for
the
men
,
with
a
spiral
staircase
that
reverberates
under
their
*NL*
wooden
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
daylight
coming
through
the
plain
glass
windows
falls
obliquely
upon
*NL*
the
pews
ranged
along
the
walls
,
which
are
adorned
here
and
there
with
*NL*
a

beneath
it
the

``

''
Farther
on
,
at
a
spot
where
the
building
narrows
,
the
*NL*
confessional
forms
a
pendant
to
a
statuette
of
the
Virgin
,
clothed
in
*NL*
a
satin
robe
,
coifed
with
a
tulle
veil
sprinkled
with
silver
stars
,
and
*NL*
with
red
cheeks
,
like
an
idol
of
the
Sandwich
Islands
;
and
,
finally
,
a
*NL*
copy
of
the
``
Holy
Family
,
presented
by
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
,
''
*NL*
overlooking
the
high
altar
,
between
four
candlesticks
,
closes
in
the
*NL*
perspective
.
The
choir
stalls
,
of
deal
wood
,
have
been
left
unpainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
market
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
tiled
roof
supported
by
some
twenty
posts
,
*NL*
occupies
of
itself
about
half
the
public
square
of
Yonville
.
The
town
*NL*
hall
,
constructed
``
from
the
designs
of
a
Paris
architect
,
''
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
Greek
temple
that
forms
the
corner
next
to
the
chemist
's
shop
.
On
*NL*
the
ground-floor
are
three
Ionic
columns
and
on
the
first
floor
a
*NL*
semicircular
gallery
,
while
the
dome
that
crowns
it
is
occupied
by
a
*NL*
Gallic
cock
,
resting
one
foot
upon
the
``
Charte
''
and
holding
in
the
other
*NL*
the
scales
of
Justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
most
attracts
the
eye
is
opposite
the
Lion
d'Or
inn
,
the
*NL*
chemist
's
shop
of
Monsieur
Homais
.
In
the
evening
especially
its
argand
*NL*
lamp
is
lit
up
and
the
red
and
green
jars
that
embellish
his
shop-front
*NL*
throw
far
across
the
street
their
two
streams
of
colour
;
then
across
*NL*
them
as
if
in
Bengal
lights
is
seen
the
shadow
of
the
chemist
*NL*
leaning
over
his
desk
.
His
house
from
top
to
bottom
is
placarded
with
*NL*
inscriptions
written
in
large
hand
,
round
hand
,
printed
hand
:
``

*NL*
Seltzer
,

,
blood
purifiers
,

,
*NL*

,
Darcet
lozenges
,
Regnault
paste
,
trusses
,
baths
,
*NL*
hygienic
chocolate
,
''
etc.
.
And
the
signboard
,
which
takes
up
all
the
*NL*
breadth
of
the
shop
,
bears
in
gold
letters
,
``
Homais
,
Chemist
.
''
Then
at
*NL*
the
back
of
the
shop
,
behind
the
great
scales
fixed
to
the
counter
,
the
*NL*
word
``
Laboratory
''
appears
on
a
scroll
above
a
glass
door
,
which
about
*NL*
half-way
up
once
more
repeats
``
Homais
''
in
gold
letters
on
a
black
*NL*
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
this
there
is
nothing
to
see
at
Yonville
.
The
street
-LRB-
the
only
*NL*
one
-RRB-
a
gunshot
in
length
and
flanked
by
a
few
shops
on
either
side
stops
*NL*
short
at
the
turn
of
the
highroad
.
If
it
is
left
on
the
right
hand
and
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
Saint-Jean
hills
followed
the
cemetery
is
soon
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
of
the
cholera
,
in
order
to
enlarge
this
,
a
piece
of
wall
*NL*
was
pulled
down
,
and
three
acres
of
land
by
its
side
purchased
;
but
all
*NL*
the
new
portion
is
almost
tenantless
;
the
tombs
,
as
heretofore
,
*NL*
continue
to
crowd
together
towards
the
gate
.
The
keeper
,
who
is
at
once
*NL*
gravedigger
and
church
beadle
-LRB-
thus
making
a
double
profit
out
of
the
*NL*
parish
corpses
-RRB-
,
has
taken
advantage
of
the
unused
plot
of
ground
to
*NL*
plant
potatoes
there
.
From
year
to
year
,
however
,
his
small
field
grows
*NL*
smaller
,
and
when
there
is
an
epidemic
,
he
does
not
know
whether
to
*NL*
rejoice
at
the
deaths
or
regret
the
burials
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
live
on
the
dead
,
Lestiboudois
!
''
the
curie
at
last
said
to
him
one
*NL*
day
.
This
grim
remark
made
him
reflect
;
it
checked
him
for
some
time
;
*NL*
but
to
this
day
he
carries
on
the
cultivation
of
his
little
tubers
,
and
*NL*
even
maintains
stoutly
that
they
grow
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
events
about
to
be
narrated
,
nothing
in
fact
has
changed
*NL*
at
Yonville
.
The
tin
tricolour
flag
still
swings
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
church-steeple
;
the
two
chintz
streamers
still
flutter
in
the
wind
from
*NL*
the
linen-draper
's
;
the
chemist
's
fetuses
,
like
lumps
of
white
amadou
,
*NL*
rot
more
and
more
in
their
turbid
alcohol
,
and
above
the
big
door
of
*NL*
the
inn
the
old
golden
lion
,
faded
by
rain
,
still
shows
passers-by
its
*NL*
poodle
mane
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
when
the
Bovarys
were
to
arrive
at
Yonville
,
Widow
*NL*
Lefrancois
,
the
landlady
of
this
inn
,
was
so
very
busy
that
she
sweated
*NL*
great
drops
as
she
moved
her
saucepans
.
To-morrow
was
market-day
.
The
*NL*
meat
had
to
be
cut
beforehand
,
the
fowls
drawn
,
the
soup
and
coffee
*NL*
made
.
Moreover
,
she
had
the
boarders
'
meal
to
see
to
,
and
that
of
the
*NL*
doctor
,
his
wife
,
and
their
servant
;
the
billiard-room
was
echoing
with
*NL*
bursts
of
laughter
;
three
millers
in
a
small
parlour
were
calling
for
*NL*
brandy
;
the
wood
was
blazing
,
the
brazen
pan
was
hissing
,
and
on
the
*NL*
long
kitchen
table
,
amid
the
quarters
of
raw
mutton
,
rose
piles
of
*NL*
plates
that
rattled
with
the
shaking
of
the
block
on
which
spinach
was
*NL*
being
chopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
poultry-yard
was
heard
the
screaming
of
the
fowls
whom
the
*NL*
servant
was
chasing
in
order
to
wring
their
necks
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
slightly
marked
with
small-pox
,
in
green
leather
slippers
,
and
*NL*
wearing
a
velvet
cap
with
a
gold
tassel
,
was
warming
his
back
at
the
*NL*
chimney
.
His
face
expressed
nothing
but
self-satisfaction
,
and
he
*NL*
appeared
to
take
life
as
calmly
as
the
goldfinch
suspended
over
his
head
*NL*
in
its
wicker
cage
:
this
was
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Artemise
!
''
shouted
the
landlady
,
``
chop
some
wood
,
fill
the
water
*NL*
bottles
,
bring
some
brandy
,
look
sharp
!
If
only
I
knew
what
dessert
to
*NL*
offer
the
guests
you
are
expecting
!
Good
heavens
!
Those
furniture-movers
*NL*
are
beginning
their
racket
in
the
billiard-room
again
;
and
their
van
has
*NL*
been
left
before
the
front
door
!
The
`
Hirondelle
'
might
run
into
it
when
*NL*
it
draws
up
.
Call
Polyte
and
tell
him
to
put
it
up
.
Only
think
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Homais
,
that
since
morning
they
have
had
about
fifteen
games
,
and
drunk
*NL*
eight
jars
of
cider
!
Why
,
they
'll
tear
my
cloth
for
me
,
''
she
went
on
,
*NL*
looking
at
them
from
a
distance
,
her
strainer
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
n't
be
much
of
a
loss
,
''
replied
Monsieur
Homais
.
``
You
would
*NL*
buy
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
billiard-table
!
''
exclaimed
the
widow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
that
one
is
coming
to
pieces
,
Madame
Lefrancois
.
I
tell
you
again
*NL*
you
are
doing
yourself
harm
,
much
harm
!
And
besides
,
players
now
want
*NL*
narrow
pockets
and
heavy
cues
.
Hazards
are
n't
played
now
;
everything
is
*NL*
changed
!
One
must
keep
pace
with
the
times
!
Just
look
at
Tellier
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hostess
reddened
with
vexation
.
The
chemist
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
what
you
like
;
his
table
is
better
than
yours

and

,
for

getting
up
a

the
sufferers

the
Lyons
floods

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

him

interrupted
the
*NL*
landlady
,
shrugging
her
fat
shoulders
.
``
Come

come
,
Monsieur
Homais
;
as
*NL*
long
as
the
`
Lion
d'Or

exists

come
to
it

We

feathered

our
nest

one
of
these
days
you
'll
find
the
`
Cafe
Francais

closed
*NL*
with
a
big
placard
on
the
shutters

Change
my
billiard-table

she
went
*NL*
on
,
speaking
to
herself
,
``
the
table
that
comes
in
so
handy
for
folding
*NL*
the
washing
,
and
on
which
,
in
the
hunting
season
,
I
have
slept
six
*NL*
visitors

But

dawdler

*NL*
``
Are

``
Wait

And
what
about
Monsieur
Binet

clock
strikes

six

'll

him
come
in

for
he
has
n't
his
equal
under
the
sun
for
*NL*
punctuality

He
must
always
have
his
seat
in
the
small
parlour

He
'd
*NL*
rather
die
than
dine
anywhere
else

And
so
squeamish
as
he
is

so
*NL*
particular
about
the
cider

Not
like
Monsieur
Leon

he
sometimes
comes

at
seven

even
half-past

he
does

so
much

Never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
see

there
's
a
great
difference

*NL*
*NL*
Six
o'clock
struck
.
Binet
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wore
a
blue
frock-coat
falling
in
a
straight
line
round
his
thin
*NL*
body
,
and
his
leather
cap
,
with
its
lappets
knotted
over
the
top
of
*NL*
his
head
with
string
,
showed
under
the
turned-up
peak
a
bald
forehead
,
*NL*
flattened
by
the
constant
wearing
of
a
helmet
.
He
wore
a
black
cloth
*NL*
waistcoat
,
a
hair
collar
,
grey
trousers
,
and
,
all
the
year
round
,
*NL*
well-blacked
boots
,
that
had
two
parallel
swellings
due
to
the
sticking
*NL*
out
of
his
big-toes
.
Not
a
hair
stood
out
from
the
regular
line
of
fair
*NL*
whiskers
,
which
,
encircling
his
jaws
,
framed
,
after
the
fashion
of
a
*NL*
garden
border
,
his
long
,
wan
face
,
whose
eyes
were
small
and
the
nose
*NL*
hooked
.
Clever
at
all
games
of
cards
,
a
good
hunter
,
and
writing
a
*NL*
fine
hand
,
he
had
at
home
a
lathe
,
and
amused
himself
by
turning
napkin
*NL*
rings
,
with
which
he
filled
up
his
house
,
with
the
jealousy
of
an
artist
*NL*
and
the
egotism
of
a
bourgeois
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
small
parlour
,
but
the
three
millers
had
to
be
got
out
*NL*
first
,
and
during
the
whole
time
necessary
for
laying
the
cloth
,
Binet
*NL*
remained
silent
in
his
place
near
the
stove
.
Then
he
shut
the
door
and
*NL*
took
off
his
cap
in
his
usual
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

with
saying
civil

as
soon
as
he
was
along
with
the
landlady

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
talks
more

she
replied
.
``
Last
week
two
travelers

cloth

such
clever
chaps

told
such
jokes
in
the
*NL*
evening

that
I
fairly
cried
with
laughing

he
stood
there
like
a

dab

never
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

observed
the

no

no

nothing

``
Yet
they

objected
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Parts

replied
Monsieur
Homais

``

parts

In
his
own
line
it

possible

he
added
in
a
calmer

And
he
went
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

That
a
merchant

who
has
large

should
be
thus
absent-minded

that
they
should
become
*NL*
whimsical
or
even
peevish
,
I
can
understand
;
such
cases
are
cited
in
*NL*
history

But
at

it
is
because
they
are
thinking

something

*NL*
Myself
,
for
example
,
how
often
has
it
happened
to
me
to
look
on
the
*NL*
bureau
for
my
pen
to
write
a
label

and
to
find
,
after
all

that
I
had

put
it
behind
my

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Lefrancois
just
then
went
to
the
door
to
see
if
the
``
Hirondelle
''
*NL*
were
not
coming
.
She
started
.
A
man
dressed
in
black
suddenly
came
into
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
By
the
last
gleam
of
the
twilight
one
could
see
that
his
*NL*
face
was
rubicund
and
his
form
athletic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
Monsieur
le
Curie
?
''
asked
the
landlady
,
as
she
*NL*
reached
down
from
the
chimney
one
of
the
copper
candlesticks
placed
*NL*
with
their
candles
in
a
row
.
``
Will
you
take
something
?
A
thimbleful
of
*NL*
Cassis

?
A
glass
of
wine
?

*NL*
*NL*
*
Black
currant
liqueur
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
declined
very
politely
.
He
had
come
for
his
umbrella
,
that
*NL*
he
had
forgotten
the
other
day
at
the
Ernemont
convent
,
and
after
*NL*
asking
Madame
Lefrancois
to
have
it
sent
to
him
at
the
presbytery
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
he
left
for
the
church
,
from
which
the
Angelus
was
ringing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
chemist
no
longer
heard
the
noise
of
his
boots
along
the
*NL*
square
,
he
thought
the
priest
's
behaviour
just
now
very
unbecoming
.
This
*NL*
refusal
to
take
any
refreshment
seemed
to
him
the
most
odious
hypocrisy
;
*NL*
all
priests
tippled
on
the
sly
,
and
were
trying
to
bring
back
the
days
*NL*
of
the
tithe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
took
up
the
defence
of
her
curie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides

he
could
double
up
four

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo

''
said
the

.
``
Now
just
send
your

such

*NL*

once

Yes

``
Be

*NL*
*NL*
The
chemist
answered
:
``
I
have
a
religion
,
my
religion
,
and
I
even
have
*NL*
more
than
all
these
others
with
their
mummeries
and
their
juggling
.
*NL*
I
adore
God
,
on
the
contrary

I
believe
in
the
Supreme
Being
,
in
a
*NL*
Creator
,
whatever
he
may
be

I
care
little
who
has
placed
us
here
below
*NL*
to
fulfil
our
duties
as
citizens
and
fathers
of
families
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
need
to
go
to
church
to
kiss
silver
plates
,
and
fatten
,
out
of
my
*NL*
pocket
,
a
lot
of
good-for-nothings
who
live
better
than
we
do
.
For
one
*NL*
can
know
Him
as
well
in
a
wood
,
in
a
field
,
or
even
contemplating
the
*NL*
eternal
vault
like
the
ancients
.
My
God
!
Mine
is
the
God
of
Socrates
,
of
*NL*
Franklin
,
of
Voltaire
,
and
of
Beranger
!
I
am
for
the
profession
of
faith
*NL*
of
the
`
Savoyard
Vicar
,
'
and
the
immortal
principles
of
'
89
!
And
I
ca
n't
*NL*
admit
of
an
old
boy
of
a
God
who
takes
walks
in
his
garden
with
a
*NL*
cane
in
his
hand
,
who
lodges
his
friends
in
the
belly
of
whales
,
dies
*NL*
uttering
a
cry
,
and
rises
again
at
the
end
of
three
days
;
things
absurd
*NL*
in
themselves
,
and
completely
opposed
,
moreover
,
to
all
physical
laws
,
*NL*
which
prove
to
us
,
by
the
way
,
that
priests
have
always
wallowed
in
*NL*
turpid
ignorance
,
in
which
they
would
fain
engulf
the
people
with
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
,
looking
round
for
an
audience
,
for
in
his
bubbling
over
*NL*
the
chemist
had
for
a
moment
fancied
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
town
*NL*
council
.
But
the
landlady
no
longer
heeded
him
;
she
was
listening
to
a
*NL*
distant
rolling
.
One
could
distinguish
the
noise
of
a
carriage
mingled
*NL*
with
the
clattering
of
loose
horseshoes
that
beat
against
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
at
last
the
``
Hirondelle
''
stopped
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
yellow
box
on
two
large
wheels
,
that
,
reaching
to
the
tilt
,
*NL*
prevented
travelers
from
seeing
the
road
and
dirtied
their
shoulders
.
*NL*
The
small
panes
of
the
narrow
windows
rattled
in
their
sashes
when
the
*NL*
coach
was
closed
,
and
retained
here
and
there
patches
of
mud
amid
the
*NL*
old
layers
of
dust
,
that
not
even
storms
of
rain
had
altogether
washed
*NL*
away
.
It
was
drawn
by
three
horses
,
the
first
a
leader
,
and
when
it
came
*NL*
down-hill
its
bottom
jolted
against
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
inhabitants
of
Yonville
came
out
into
the
square
;
they
all
*NL*
spoke
at
once
,
asking
for
news
,
for
explanations
,
for
hampers
.
Hivert
*NL*
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
.
It
was
he
who
did
the
errands
of
the
place
*NL*
in
town
.
He
went
to
the
shops
and
brought
back
rolls
of
leather
for
*NL*
the
shoemaker
,
old
iron
for
the
farrier
,
a
barrel
of
herrings
for
his
*NL*
mistress
,
caps
from
the
milliner
's
,
locks
from
the
hair-dresser
's
and
*NL*
all
along
the
road
on
his
return
journey
he
distributed
his
parcels
,
*NL*
which
he
threw
,
standing
upright
on
his
seat
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
*NL*
his
voice
,
over
the
enclosures
of
the
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
accident
had
delayed
him
.
Madame
Bovary
's
greyhound
had
run
across
*NL*
the
field
.
They
had
whistled
for
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
Hivert
had
*NL*
even
gone
back
a
mile
and
a
half
expecting
every
moment
to
catch
sight
*NL*
of
her
;
but
it
had
been
necessary
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
had
wept
,
grown
angry
;
she
had
accused
Charles
of
this
misfortune
.
*NL*
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
a
draper
,
who
happened
to
be
in
the
coach
with
*NL*
her
,
had
tried
to
console
her
by
a
number
of
examples
of
lost
dogs
*NL*
recognizing
their
masters
at
the
end
of
long
years
.
One
,
he
said
had
*NL*
been
told
of
,
who
had
come
back
to
Paris
from
Constantinople
.
Another
*NL*
had
gone
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
a
straight
line
,
and
swum
four
*NL*
rivers
;
and
his
own
father
had
possessed
a
poodle
,
which
,
after
twelve
*NL*
years
of
absence
,
had
all
of
a
sudden
jumped
on
his
back
in
the
street
*NL*
as
he
was
going
to
dine
in
town
.

Chapter
Two
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
got
out
first
,
then
Felicite
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
and
a
nurse
,
and
*NL*
they
had
to
wake
up
Charles
in
his
corner
,
where
he
had
slept
soundly
*NL*
since
night
set
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
introduced
himself
;
he
offered
his
homages
to
madame
and
his
*NL*
respects
to
monsieur
;
said
he
was
charmed
to
have
been
able
to
render
*NL*
them
some
slight
service
,
and
added
with
a
cordial
air
that
he
had
*NL*
ventured
to
invite
himself
,
his
wife
being
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Madame
Bovary
was
in
the
kitchen
she
went
up
to
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
tips
of
her
fingers
she
caught
her
dress
at
the
knee
,
and
*NL*
having
thus
pulled
it
up
to
her
ankle
,
held
out
her
foot
in
its
black
*NL*
boot
to
the
fire
above
the
revolving
leg
of
mutton
.
The
flame
lit
up
the
*NL*
whole
of
her
,
penetrating
with
a
crude
light
the
woof
of
her
gowns
,
the
*NL*
fine
pores
of
her
fair
skin
,
and
even
her
eyelids
,
which
she
blinked
now
*NL*
and
again
.
A
great
red
glow
passed
over
her
with
the
blowing
of
the
wind
*NL*
through
the
half-open
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
a
young
man
with
fair
hair
watched
her
*NL*
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
a
good
deal
bored
at
Yonville
,
where
he
was
a
clerk
at
the
*NL*
notary
's
,
Monsieur
Guillaumin
,
Monsieur
Leon
Dupuis
-LRB-
it
was
he
who
*NL*
was
the
second
habitue
of
the
``
Lion
d'Or
''
-RRB-
frequently
put
back
his
*NL*
dinner-hour
in
hope
that
some
traveler
might
come
to
the
inn
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
could
chat
in
the
evening
.
On
the
days
when
his
work
was
done
early
,
*NL*
he
had
,
for
want
of
something
else
to
do
,
to
come
punctually
,
and
endure
*NL*
from
soup
to
cheese
a
tete-a-tete
with
Binet
.
It
was
therefore
with
*NL*
delight
that
he
accepted
the
landlady
's
suggestion
that
he
should
dine
*NL*
in
company
with
the
newcomers
,
and
they
passed
into
the
large
parlour
*NL*
where
Madame
Lefrancois
,
for
the
purpose
of
showing
off
,
had
had
the
*NL*
table
laid
for
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
asked
to
be
allowed
to
keep
on
his
skull-cap
,
for
fear
of
coryza
;
*NL*
then
,
turning
to
his
neighbour
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
is
no
doubt
a
little
fatigued
;
one
gets
jolted
so
abominably
in
*NL*
our
`
Hirondelle
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
replied
Emma
;
``
but
moving
about
always
amuses
me
.
I
like
*NL*
change
of
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
tedious
,
''
sighed
the
clerk
,
``
to
be
always
riveted
to
the
same
*NL*
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
like
me
,
''
said
Charles
,
``
constantly
obliged
to
be
in
the
*NL*
saddle
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
Leon
went
on
,
addressing
himself
to
Madame
Bovary
,
``
nothing
,
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
,
is
more
pleasant
--
when
one
can
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moreover
,
''
said
the
druggist
,
``
the
practice
of
medicine
is
not
very
*NL*
hard
work
in
our
part
of
the
world
,
for
the
state
of
our
roads
allows
us
*NL*
the
use
of
gigs
,
and
generally
,
as
the
farmers
are
prosperous
,
they
pay
*NL*
pretty
well
.
We
have
,
medically
speaking
,
besides
the
ordinary
cases
*NL*
of
enteritis
,
bronchitis
,
bilious
affections
,
etc.
,
now
and
then
a
*NL*
few
intermittent
fevers
at
harvest-time
;
but
on
the
whole
,
little
of
a
*NL*
serious
nature
,
nothing
special
to
note
,
unless
it
be
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
scrofula
,
due
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
deplorable
hygienic
conditions
of
our
*NL*
peasant
dwellings
.
Ah
!
you
will
find
many
prejudices
to
combat
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Bovary
,
much
obstinacy
of
routine
,
with
which
all
the
efforts
of
your
*NL*
science
will
daily
come
into
collision
;
for
people
still
have
recourse
*NL*
to
novenas
,
to
relics
,
to
the
priest
,
rather
than
come
straight
to
the
*NL*
doctor
or
the
chemist
.
The
climate
,
however
,
is
not
,
truth
to
tell
,
bad
,
*NL*
and
we
even
have
a
few
nonagenarians
in
our
parish
.
The
thermometer
-LRB-
I
*NL*
have
made
some
observations
-RRB-
falls
in
winter
to
4
degrees
Centigrade
*NL*
at
the
outside
,
which
gives
us
24
degrees
Reaumur
as
the
maximum
,
or
*NL*
otherwise
54
degrees
Fahrenheit
-LRB-
English
scale
-RRB-
,
not
more
.
And
,
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
we
are
sheltered
from
the
north
winds
by
the
forest
of
*NL*
Argueil
on
the
one
side
,
from
the
west
winds
by
the
St.
Jean
range
on
*NL*
the
other
;
and
this
heat
,
moreover
,
which
,
on
account
of
the
aqueous
*NL*
vapours
given
off
by
the
river
and
the
considerable
number
of
cattle
*NL*
in
the
fields
,
which
,
as
you
know
,
exhale
much
ammonia
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
nitrogen

hydrogen
and
oxygen
-LRB-
no

nitrogen

hydrogen
alone

and
*NL*
which
sucking
up
into
itself
the
humus
from
the
ground
,
mixing
together
*NL*
all
those
different
emanations

unites
them
into
a
stack

so
to

*NL*
and
combining
with
the
electricity
diffused
through

there
is
any

might
in
the
long
run

as
in
tropical
countries

insalubrious
miasmata

this
heat
,
I
say
,
finds
itself
perfectly
tempered
*NL*
on
the
side
whence
it
comes
,
or
rather
whence
it
should
come
--
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
southern
side
--
by
the
south-eastern
winds
,
which
,
having
cooled
*NL*
themselves
passing
over
the
Seine

reach
us
sometimes
all
at
once

breezes
from
Russia

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any

you

continued

Madame

,
speaking
to
the
young

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
answered

call

the
top

on

edge

forest

Sometimes

watching

Monsieur

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then

does
it
not
seem
to
you

''
continued
Madame
Bovary
,
``
that
the
*NL*
mind
travels
more
freely
on
this
limitless
expanse
,
the
contemplation
of
*NL*
which
elevates
the
soul
,
gives
ideas
of
the
infinite
,
the
ideal

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
same
with
mountainous
landscapes

''
continued
Leon
.
``
A
cousin
*NL*
of
mine
who
travelled
in
Switzerland
last
year
told
me
that
one
could

not

oneself
the
poetry

the
charm
of
the
*NL*
waterfalls

the
gigantic
effect

One
sees

incredible
size

suspended
over
precipices

*NL*

a
thousand
feet
below

whole
valleys
when
the
clouds
open

Such
*NL*
spectacles
must
stir
to
enthusiasm

incline
to
prayer

to
ecstasy

I
*NL*
no
longer
marvel
at
that
celebrated
musician
who
,
the
better
to
inspire

his
imagination

was
in

playing

``

she
asked

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
Leon

lodged
at

he
had
a
small

overlooking

He
blushed
at
the
compliment

had
already
turned

was
enumerating
to

all

He

was
telling

giving

to
the
opera
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
;
but
I
shall
go
next
year
,
when
I
am
living
at
Paris
to
finish
*NL*
reading
for
the
bar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
had
the
honour
of
putting
it
to
your
husband
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
*NL*
``
with
regard
to
this
poor
Yanoda
who
has
run
away
,
you
will
find
*NL*
yourself
,
thanks
to
his
extravagance
,
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
*NL*
most
comfortable
houses
of
Yonville
.
Its
greatest
convenience
for
a
*NL*
doctor
is
a
door
giving
on
the
Walk
,
where
one
can
go
in
and
out
unseen
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
contains
everything
that
is
agreeable
in
a
household
--
a
*NL*
laundry
,
kitchen
with
offices
,
sitting-room
,
fruit-room
,
and
so
on
.
He
*NL*
was
a
gay
dog
,
who
did
n't
care
what
he
spent
.
At
the
end
of
the
garden
,
*NL*
by
the
side
of
the
water
,
he
had
an
arbour
built
just
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
drinking
beer
in
summer
;
and
if
madame
is
fond
of
gardening
she
will
be
*NL*
able
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
does
n't
care
about
it
,
''
said
Charles
;
``
although
she
has
*NL*
been
advised
to
take
exercise
,
she
prefers
always
sitting
in
her
room
*NL*
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
me
,
''
replied
Leon
.
``
And
indeed
,
what
is
better
than
to
sit
by
*NL*
one
's
fireside
in
the
evening
with
a
book
,
while
the
wind
beats
against
*NL*
the
window
and
the
lamp
is
burning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
indeed
?
''
she
said
,
fixing
her
large
black
eyes
wide
open
upon
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thinks
of
nothing
,
''
he
continued
;
``
the
hours
slip
by
.
Motionless
we
*NL*
traverse
countries
we
fancy
we
see
,
and
your
thought
,
blending
with
*NL*
the
fiction
,
playing
with
the
details
,
follows
the
outline
of
the
*NL*
adventures
.
It
mingles
with
the
characters
,
and
it
seems
as
if
it
were
*NL*
yourself
palpitating
beneath
their
costumes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
!
That
is
true
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
it
ever
happened
to
you
,
''
Leon
went
on
,
``
to
come
across
some
vague
*NL*
idea
of
one
's
own
in
a
book
,
some
dim
image
that
comes
back
to
you
from
*NL*
afar
,
and
as
the
completest
expression
of
your
own
slightest
sentiment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
experienced
it
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
why
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
especially
love
the
poets
.
I
think
verse
more
*NL*
tender
than
prose
,
and
that
it
moves
far
more
easily
to
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
in
the
long
run
it
is
tiring
,
''
continued
Emma
.
``
Now
I
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
adore
stories
that
rush
breathlessly
along
,
that
frighten
one
.
*NL*
I
detest
commonplace
heroes
and
moderate
sentiments
,
such
as
there
are
*NL*
in
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
''
observed
the
clerk
,
``
these
works
,
not
touching
the
heart
,
*NL*
miss
,
it
seems
to
me
,
the
true
end
of
art
.
It
is
so
sweet
,
amid
all
*NL*
the
disenchantments
of
life
,
to
be
able
to
dwell
in
thought
upon
noble
*NL*
characters
,
pure
affections
,
and
pictures
of
happiness
.
For
myself
,
*NL*
living
here
far
from
the
world
,
this
is
my
one
distraction
;
but
Yonville
*NL*
affords
so
few
resources
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
Tostes
,
no
doubt
,
''
replied
Emma
;
``
and
so
I
always
subscribed
to
a
*NL*
lending
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
madame
will
do
me
the
honour
of
making
use
of
it
''
,
said
the
chemist
,
*NL*
who
had
just
caught
the
last
words
,
``
I
have
at
her
disposal
a
library
*NL*
composed
of
the
best
authors
,
Voltaire
,
Rousseau
,
Delille
,
Walter
*NL*
Scott
,
the
`
Echo
des
Feuilletons
'
;
and
in
addition
I
receive
various
*NL*
periodicals
,
among
them
the
`
Fanal
de
Rouen
'
daily
,
having
the
advantage
*NL*
to
be
its
correspondent
for
the
districts
of
Buchy
,
Forges
,
Neufchatel
,
*NL*
Yonville
,
and
vicinity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
hours
and
a
half
they
had
been
at
table
;
for
the
servant
*NL*
Artemis
,
carelessly
dragging
her
old
list
slippers
over
the
flags
,
*NL*
brought
one
plate
after
the
other
,
forgot
everything
,
and
constantly
*NL*
left
the
door
of
the
billiard-room
half
open
,
so
that
it
beat
against
*NL*
the
wall
with
its
hooks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unconsciously
,
Leon
,
while
talking
,
had
placed
his
foot
on
one
of
the
*NL*
bars
of
the
chair
on
which
Madame
Bovary
was
sitting
.
She
wore
a
small
*NL*
blue
silk
necktie
,
that
kept
up
like
a
ruff
a
gauffered
cambric
collar
,
*NL*
and
with
the
movements
of
her
head
the
lower
part
of
her
face
gently
*NL*
sunk
into
the
linen
or
came
out
from
it
.
Thus
side
by
side
,
while
*NL*
Charles
and
the
chemist
chatted
,
they
entered
into
one
of
those
vague
*NL*
conversations
where
the
hazard
of
all
that
is
said
brings
you
back
to
*NL*
the
fixed
centre
of
a
common
sympathy
.
The
Paris
theatres
,
titles
of
*NL*
novels
,
new
quadrilles
,
and
the
world
they
did
not
know
;
Tostes
,
where
*NL*
she
had
lived
,
and
Yonville
,
where
they
were
;
they
examined
all
,
talked
*NL*
of
everything
till
to
the
end
of
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
coffee
was
served
Felicite
went
away
to
get
ready
the
room
in
the
*NL*
new
house
,
and
the
guests
soon
raised
the
siege
.
Madame
Lefrancois
was
*NL*
asleep
near
the
cinders
,
while
the
stable-boy
,
lantern
in
hand
,
was
*NL*
waiting
to
show
Monsieur
and
Madame
Bovary
the
way
home
.
Bits
of
straw
*NL*
stuck
in
his
red
hair
,
and
he
limped
with
his
left
leg
.
When
he
had
*NL*
taken
in
his
other
hand
the
cure
's
umbrella
,
they
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
was
asleep
;
the
pillars
of
the
market
threw
great
shadows
;
the
*NL*
earth
was
all
grey
as
on
a
summer
's
night
.
But
as
the
doctor
's
house
was
*NL*
only
some
fifty
paces
from
the
inn
,
they
had
to
say
good-night
almost
*NL*
immediately
,
and
the
company
dispersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
entered
the
passage
,
Emma
felt
the
cold
of
the
plaster
*NL*
fall
about
her
shoulders
like
damp
linen
.
The
walls
were
new
and
the
*NL*
wooden
stairs
creaked
.
In
their
bedroom
,
on
the
first
floor
,
a
whitish
*NL*
light
passed
through
the
curtainless
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
catch
glimpses
of
tree
tops
,
and
beyond
,
the
fields
,
*NL*
half-drowned
in
the
fog
that
lay
reeking
in
the
moonlight
along
*NL*
the
course
of
the
river
.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
,
pell-mell
,
were
*NL*
scattered
drawers
,
bottles
,
curtain-rods
,
gilt
poles
,
with
mattresses
*NL*
on
the
chairs
and
basins
on
the
ground
--
the
two
men
who
had
brought
the
*NL*
furniture
had
left
everything
about
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
fourth
time
that
she
had
slept
in
a
strange
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
was
the
day
of
her
going
to
the
convent
;
the
second
,
of
her
*NL*
arrival
at
Tostes
;
the
third
,
at
Vaubyessard
;
and
this
was
the
fourth
.
*NL*
And
each
one
had
marked
,
as
it
were
,
the
inauguration
of
a
new
phase
in
*NL*
her
life
.
She
did
not
believe
that
things
could
present
themselves
in
*NL*
the
same
way
in
different
places
,
and
since
the
portion
of
her
life
*NL*
lived
had
been
bad
,
no
doubt
that
which
remained
to
be
lived
would
be
*NL*
better
.

Chapter
Three
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
as
she
was
getting
up
,
she
saw
the
clerk
on
the
Place
.
She
*NL*
had
on
a
dressing-gown
.
He
looked
up
and
bowed
.
She
nodded
quickly
and
*NL*
reclosed
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
waited
all
day
for
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
to
come
,
but
on
going
*NL*
to
the
inn
,
he
found
no
one
but
Monsieur
Binet
,
already
at
table
.
The
*NL*
dinner
of
the
evening
before
had
been
a
considerable
event
for
him
;
he
*NL*
had
never
till
then
talked
for
two
hours
consecutively
to
a
``
lady
.
''
How
*NL*
then
had
he
been
able
to
explain
,
and
in
such
language
,
the
number
of
*NL*
things
that
he
could
not
have
said
so
well
before
?
He
was
usually
*NL*
shy
,
and
maintained
that
reserve
which
partakes
at
once
of
modesty
and
*NL*
dissimulation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Yonville
he
was
considered
``
well-bred
.
''
He
listened
to
the
arguments
*NL*
of
the
older
people
,
and
did
not
seem
hot
about
politics
--
a
remarkable
*NL*
thing
for
a
young
man
.
Then
he
had
some
accomplishments
;
he
painted
in
*NL*
water-colours
,
could
read
the
key
of
G
,
and
readily
talked
literature
*NL*
after
dinner
when
he
did
not
play
cards
.
Monsieur
Homais
respected
him
*NL*
for
his
education
;
Madame
Homais
liked
him
for
his
good-nature
,
for
*NL*
he
often
took
the
little
Homais
into
the
garden
--
little
brats
who
were
*NL*
always
dirty
,
very
much
spoilt
,
and
somewhat
lymphatic
,
like
their
*NL*
mother
.
Besides
the
servant
to
look
after
them
,
they
had
Justin
,
the
*NL*
chemist
's
apprentice
,
a
second
cousin
of
Monsieur
Homais
,
who
had
been
*NL*
taken
into
the
house
from
charity
,
and
who
was
useful
at
the
same
time
*NL*
as
a
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
proved
the
best
of
neighbours
.
He
gave
Madame
Bovary
*NL*
information
as
to
the
trades-people
,
sent
expressly
for
his
own
cider
*NL*
merchant
,
tasted
the
drink
himself
,
and
saw
that
the
casks
were
properly
*NL*
placed
in
the
cellar
;
he
explained
how
to
set
about
getting
in
a
*NL*
supply
of
butter
cheap
,
and
made
an
arrangement
with
Lestiboudois
,
the
*NL*
sacristan
,
who
,
besides
his
sacerdotal
and
funeral
functions
,
looked
*NL*
after
the
principal
gardens
at
Yonville
by
the
hour
or
the
year
,
*NL*
according
to
the
taste
of
the
customers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
need
of
looking
after
others
was
not
the
only
thing
that
urged
the
*NL*
chemist
to
such
obsequious
cordiality
;
there
was
a
plan
underneath
it
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
infringed
the
law
of
the
19th
Ventose
,
year
xi.
,
article
I
,
which
*NL*
forbade
all
persons
not
having
a
diploma
to
practise
medicine
;
so
that
,
*NL*
after
certain
anonymous
denunciations
,
Homais
had
been
summoned
to
Rouen
*NL*
to
see
the
procurer
of
the
king
in
his
own
private
room
;
the
magistrate
*NL*
receiving
him
standing
up
,
ermine
on
shoulder
and
cap
on
head
.
It
was
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
before
the
court
opened
.
In
the
corridors
one
heard
*NL*
the
heavy
boots
of
the
gendarmes
walking
past
,
and
like
a
far-off
noise
*NL*
great
locks
that
were
shut
.
The
druggist
's
ears
tingled
as
if
he
were
*NL*
about
to
have
an
apoplectic
stroke
;
he
saw
the
depths
of
dungeons
,
*NL*
his
family
in
tears
,
his
shop
sold
,
all
the
jars
dispersed
;
and
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
enter
a
cafe
and
take
a
glass
of
rum
and
seltzer
to
recover
*NL*
his
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
the
memory
of
this
reprimand
grew
fainter
,
and
*NL*
he
continued
,
as
heretofore
,
to
give
anodyne
consultations
in
his
*NL*
back-parlour
.
But
the
mayor
resented
it
,
his
colleagues
were
jealous
,
*NL*
everything
was
to
be
feared
;
gaining
over
Monsieur
Bovary
by
his
*NL*
attentions
was
to
earn
his
gratitude
,
and
prevent
his
speaking
out
later
*NL*
on
,
should
he
notice
anything
.
So
every
morning
Homais
brought
him
``
the
*NL*
paper
,
''
and
often
in
the
afternoon
left
his
shop
for
a
few
moments
to
*NL*
have
a
chat
with
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
dull
:
patients
did
not
come
.
He
remained
seated
for
hours
*NL*
without
speaking
,
went
into
his
consulting
room
to
sleep
,
or
watched
*NL*
his
wife
sewing
.
Then
for
diversion
he
employed
himself
at
home
as
a
*NL*
workman
;
he
even
tried
to
do
up
the
attic
with
some
paint
which
had
been
*NL*
left
behind
by
the
painters
.
But
money
matters
worried
him
.
He
had
*NL*
spent
so
much
for
repairs
at
Tostes
,
for
madame
's
toilette
,
and
for
the
*NL*
moving
,
that
the
whole
dowry
,
over
three
thousand
crowns
,
had
slipped
*NL*
away
in
two
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
how
many
things
had
been
spoilt
or
lost
during
their
carriage
from
*NL*
Tostes
to
Yonville
,
without
counting
the
plaster
cure
,
who
falling
out
*NL*
of
the
coach
at
an
over-severe
jolt
,
had
been
dashed
into
a
thousand
*NL*
fragments
on
the
pavements
of
Quincampoix
!
A
pleasanter
trouble
came
*NL*
to
distract
him
,
namely
,
the
pregnancy
of
his
wife
.
As
the
time
of
her
*NL*
confinement
approached
he
cherished
her
the
more
.
It
was
another
bond
of
*NL*
the
flesh
establishing
itself
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
a
continued
sentiment
*NL*
of
a
more
complex
union
.
When
from
afar
he
saw
her
languid
walk
,
and
*NL*
her
figure
without
stays
turning
softly
on
her
hips
;
when
opposite
one
*NL*
another
he
looked
at
her
at
his
ease
,
while
she
took
tired
poses
in
her
*NL*
armchair
,
then
his
happiness
knew
no
bounds
;
he
got
up
,
embraced
her
,
*NL*
passed
his
hands
over
her
face
,
called
her
little
mamma
,
wanted
to
*NL*
make
her
dance
,
and
half-laughing
,
half-crying
,
uttered
all
kinds
of
*NL*
caressing
pleasantries
that
came
into
his
head
.
The
idea
of
having
*NL*
begotten
a
child
delighted
him
.
Now
he
wanted
nothing
.
He
knew
human
*NL*
life
from
end
to
end
,
and
he
sat
down
to
it
with
serenity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
at
first
felt
a
great
astonishment
;
then
was
anxious
to
be
*NL*
delivered
that
she
might
know
what
it
was
to
be
a
mother
.
But
not
*NL*
being
able
to
spend
as
much
as
she
would
have
liked
,
to
have
a
*NL*
swing-bassinette
with
rose
silk
curtains
,
and
embroidered
caps
,
in
a
fit
*NL*
of
bitterness
she
gave
up
looking
after
the
trousseau
,
and
ordered
the
*NL*
whole
of
it
from
a
village
needlewoman
,
without
choosing
or
discussing
*NL*
anything
.
Thus
she
did
not
amuse
herself
with
those
preparations
that
*NL*
stimulate
the
tenderness
of
mothers
,
and
so
her
affection
was
from
the
*NL*
very
outset
,
perhaps
,
to
some
extent
attenuated
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Charles
,
however
,
spoke
of
the
boy
at
every
meal
,
she
soon
began
to
*NL*
think
of
him
more
consecutively
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hoped
for
a
son
;
he
would
be
strong
and
dark
;
she
would
call
him
*NL*
George
;
and
this
idea
of
having
a
male
child
was
like
an
expected
*NL*
revenge
for
all
her
impotence
in
the
past
.
A
man
,
at
least
,
is
free
;
he
*NL*
may
travel
over
passions
and
over
countries
,
overcome
obstacles
,
taste
*NL*
of
the
most
far-away
pleasures
.
But
a
woman
is
always
hampered
.
At
once
*NL*
inert
and
flexible
,
she
has
against
her
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
and
*NL*
legal
dependence
.
Her
will
,
like
the
veil
of
her
bonnet
,
held
by
a
*NL*
string
,
flutters
in
every
wind
;
there
is
always
some
desire
that
draws
*NL*
her
,
some
conventionality
that
restrains
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
confined
on
a
Sunday
at
about
six
o'clock
,
as
the
sun
was
*NL*
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
girl
!
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
away
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Homais
,
as
well
as
Madame
Lefrancois
of
the
Lion
d'Or
,
almost
*NL*
immediately
came
running
in
to
embrace
her
.
The
chemist
,
as
man
of
*NL*
discretion
,
only
offered
a
few
provincial
felicitations
through
the
*NL*
half-opened
door
.
He
wished
to
see
the
child
and
thought
it
well
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
she
was
getting
well
she
occupied
herself
much
in
seeking
a
*NL*
name
for
her
daughter
.
First
she
went
over
all
those
that
have
Italian
*NL*
endings
,
such
as
Clara
,
Louisa
,
Amanda
,
Atala
;
she
liked
Galsuinde
*NL*
pretty
well
,
and
Yseult
or
Leocadie
still
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
wanted
the
child
to
be
called
after
her
mother
;
Emma
opposed
*NL*
this
.
They
ran
over
the
calendar
from
end
to
end
,
and
then
consulted
*NL*
outsiders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Leon
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
``
with
whom
I
was
talking
about
it
*NL*
the
other
day
,
wonders
you
do
not
chose
Madeleine
.
It
is
very
much
in
*NL*
fashion
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Madame
Bovary
,
senior
,
cried
out
loudly
against
this
name
of
a
*NL*
sinner
.
As
to
Monsieur
Homais
,
he
had
a
preference
for
all
those
that
*NL*
recalled
some
great
man
,
an
illustrious
fact
,
or
a
generous
idea
,
and
it
*NL*
was
on
this
system
that
he
had
baptized
his
four
children
.
Thus
Napoleon
*NL*
represented
glory
and
Franklin
liberty
;
Irma
was
perhaps
a
concession
to
*NL*
romanticism
,
but
Athalie
was
a
homage
to
the
greatest
masterpiece
of
the
*NL*
French
stage
.
For
his
philosophical
convictions
did
not
interfere
*NL*
with
his
artistic
tastes
;
in
him
the
thinker
did
not
stifle
the
man
of
*NL*
sentiment
;
he
could
make
distinctions
,
make
allowances
for
imagination
*NL*
and
fanaticism
.
In
this
tragedy
,
for
example
,
he
found
fault
with
the
*NL*
ideas
,
but
admired
the
style
;
he
detested
the
conception
,
but
applauded
*NL*
all
the
details
,
and
loathed
the
characters
while
he
grew
enthusiastic
*NL*
over
their
dialogue
.
When
he
read
the
fine
passages
he
was
transported
,
*NL*
but
when
he
thought
that
mummers
would
get
something
out
of
them
for
*NL*
their
show
,
he
was
disconsolate
;
and
in
this
confusion
of
sentiments
in
*NL*
which
he
was
involved
he
would
have
liked
at
once
to
crown
Racine
with
*NL*
both
his
hands
and
discuss
with
him
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Emma
remembered
that
at
the
chateau
of
Vaubyessard
she
had
heard
*NL*
the
Marchioness
call
a
young
lady
Berthe
;
from
that
moment
this
name
was
*NL*
chosen
;
and
as
old
Rouault
could
not
come
,
Monsieur
Homais
was
requested
*NL*
to
stand
godfather
.
His
gifts
were
all
products
from
his
establishment
,
*NL*
to
wit
:
six
boxes
of
jujubes
,
a
whole
jar
of
racahout
,
three
cakes
of
*NL*
marshmallow
paste
,
and
six
sticks
of
sugar-candy
into
the
bargain
that
*NL*
he
had
come
across
in
a
cupboard
.
On
the
evening
of
the
ceremony
there
*NL*
was
a
grand
dinner
;
the
cure
was
present
;
there
was
much
excitement
.
*NL*
Monsieur
Homais
towards
liqueur-time
began
singing
``
Le
Dieu
des
bonnes
*NL*
gens
.
''
Monsieur
Leon
sang
a
barcarolle
,
and
Madame
Bovary
,
senior
,
who
*NL*
was
godmother
,
a
romance
of
the
time
of
the
Empire
;
finally
,
M.
Bovary
,
*NL*
senior
,
insisted
on
having
the
child
brought
down
,
and
began
baptizing
*NL*
it
with
a
glass
of
champagne
that
he
poured
over
its
head
.
This
mockery
*NL*
of
the
first
of
the
sacraments
made
the
Abbe
Bournisien
angry
;
old
*NL*
Bovary
replied
by
a
quotation
from
``
La
Guerre
des
Dieux
''
;
the
cure
*NL*
wanted
to
leave
;
the
ladies
implored
,
Homais
interfered
;
and
they
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
the
priest
sit
down
again
,
and
he
quietly
went
on
*NL*
with
the
half-finished
coffee
in
his
saucer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Bovary
,
senior
,
stayed
at
Yonville
a
month
,
dazzling
the
*NL*
natives
by
a
superb
policeman
's
cap
with
silver
tassels
that
he
wore
*NL*
in
the
morning
when
he
smoked
his
pipe
in
the
square
.
Being
also
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
drinking
a
good
deal
of
brandy
,
he
often
sent
the
servant
*NL*
to
the
Lion
d'Or
to
buy
him
a
bottle
,
which
was
put
down
to
his
*NL*
son
's
account
,
and
to
perfume
his
handkerchiefs
he
used
up
his
*NL*
daughter-in-law
's
whole
supply
of
eau-de-cologne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
did
not
at
all
dislike
his
company
.
He
had
knocked
about
the
*NL*
world
,
he
talked
about
Berlin
,
Vienna
,
and
Strasbourg
,
of
his
soldier
*NL*
times
,
of
the
mistresses
he
had
had
,
the
grand
luncheons
of
which
he
had
*NL*
partaken
;
then
he
was
amiable
,
and
sometimes
even
,
either
on
the
stairs
,
*NL*
or
in
the
garden
,
would
seize
hold
of
her
waist
,
crying
,
``
Charles
,
look
*NL*
out
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Madame
Bovary
,
senior
,
became
alarmed
for
her
son
's
happiness
,
and
*NL*
fearing
that
her
husband
might
in
the
long-run
have
an
immoral
influence
*NL*
upon
the
ideas
of
the
young
woman
,
took
care
to
hurry
their
departure
.
*NL*
Perhaps
she
had
more
serious
reasons
for
uneasiness
.
Monsieur
Bovary
was
*NL*
not
the
man
to
respect
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Emma
was
suddenly
seized
with
the
desire
to
see
her
little
*NL*
girl
,
who
had
been
put
to
nurse
with
the
carpenter
's
wife
,
and
,
without
*NL*
looking
at
the
calendar
to
see
whether
the
six
weeks
of
the
Virgin
were
*NL*
yet
passed
,
she
set
out
for
the
Rollets
'
house
,
situated
at
the
extreme
*NL*
end
of
the
village
,
between
the
highroad
and
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
mid-day
,
the
shutters
of
the
houses
were
closed
and
the
slate
*NL*
roofs
that
glittered
beneath
the
fierce
light
of
the
blue
sky
seemed
to
*NL*
strike
sparks
from
the
crest
of
the
gables
.
A
heavy
wind
was
blowing
;
*NL*
Emma
felt
weak
as
she
walked
;
the
stones
of
the
pavement
hurt
her
;
she
*NL*
was
doubtful
whether
she
would
not
go
home
again
,
or
go
in
somewhere
to
*NL*
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Monsieur
Leon
came
out
from
a
neighbouring
door
with
a
*NL*
bundle
of
papers
under
his
arm
.
He
came
to
greet
her
,
and
stood
in
the
*NL*
shade
in
front
of
the
Lheureux
's
shop
under
the
projecting
grey
awning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
said
she
was
going
to
see
her
baby
,
but
that
she
was
*NL*
beginning
to
grow
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
--
''
said
Leon
,
not
daring
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
business
to
attend
to
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
the
clerk
's
answer
,
she
begged
him
to
accompany
her
.
That
same
*NL*
evening
this
was
known
in
Yonville
,
and
Madame
Tuvache
,
the
mayor
's
*NL*
wife
,
declared
in
the
presence
of
her
servant
that
``
Madame
Bovary
was
*NL*
compromising
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
to
the
nurse
's
it
was
necessary
to
turn
to
the
left
on
leaving
*NL*
the
street
,
as
if
making
for
the
cemetery
,
and
to
follow
between
little
*NL*
houses
and
yards
a
small
path
bordered
with
privet
hedges
.
They
were
*NL*
in
bloom
,
and
so
were
the
speedwells
,
eglantines
,
thistles
,
and
the
*NL*
sweetbriar
that
sprang
up
from
the
thickets
.
Through
openings
in
*NL*
the
hedges
one
could
see
into
the
huts
,
some
pigs
on
a
dung-heap
,
or
*NL*
tethered
cows
rubbing
their
horns
against
the
trunk
of
trees
.
The
two
,
*NL*
side
by
side
walked
slowly
,
she
leaning
upon
him
,
and
he
restraining
*NL*
his
pace
,
which
he
regulated
by
hers
;
in
front
of
them
a
swarm
of
midges
*NL*
fluttered
,
buzzing
in
the
warm
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
recognized
the
house
by
an
old
walnut-tree
which
shaded
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Low
and
covered
with
brown
tiles
,
there
hung
outside
it
,
beneath
the
*NL*
dormer-window
of
the
garret
,
a
string
of
onions
.
Faggots
upright
*NL*
against
a
thorn
fence
surrounded
a
bed
of
lettuce
,
a
few
square
feet
of
*NL*
lavender
,
and
sweet
peas
strung
on
sticks
.
Dirty
water
was
running
here
*NL*
and
there
on
the
grass
,
and
all
round
were
several
indefinite
rags
,
*NL*
knitted
stockings
,
a
red
calico
jacket
,
and
a
large
sheet
of
coarse
*NL*
linen
spread
over
the
hedge
.
At
the
noise
of
the
gate
the
nurse
appeared
*NL*
with
a
baby
she
was
suckling
on
one
arm
.
With
her
other
hand
she
was
*NL*
pulling
along
a
poor
puny
little
fellow
,
his
face
covered
with
scrofula
,
*NL*
the
son
of
a
Rouen
hosier
,
whom
his
parents
,
too
taken
up
with
their
*NL*
business
,
left
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
,
''
she
said
;
``
your
little
one
is
there
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
on
the
ground-floor
,
the
only
one
in
the
dwelling
,
had
at
its
*NL*
farther
end
,
against
the
wall
,
a
large
bed
without
curtains
,
while
a
*NL*
kneading-trough
took
up
the
side
by
the
window
,
one
pane
of
which
*NL*
was
mended
with
a
piece
of
blue
paper
.
In
the
corner
behind
the
door
,
*NL*
shining
hob-nailed
shoes
stood
in
a
row
under
the
slab
of
the
washstand
,
*NL*
near
a
bottle
of
oil
with
a
feather
stuck
in
its
mouth
;
a
Matthieu
*NL*
Laensberg
lay
on
the
dusty
mantelpiece
amid
gunflints
,
candle-ends
,
and
*NL*
bits
of
amadou
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
the
last
luxury
in
the
apartment
was
a
``
Fame
''
blowing
her
*NL*
trumpets
,
a
picture
cut
out
,
no
doubt
,
from
some
perfumer
's
prospectus
*NL*
and
nailed
to
the
wall
with
six
wooden
shoe-pegs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
's
child
was
asleep
in
a
wicker-cradle
.
She
took
it
up
in
the
*NL*
wrapping
that
enveloped
it
and
began
singing
softly
as
she
rocked
*NL*
herself
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
walked
up
and
down
the
room
;
it
seemed
strange
to
him
to
see
this
*NL*
beautiful
woman
in
her
nankeen
dress
in
the
midst
of
all
this
poverty
.
*NL*
Madam
Bovary
reddened
;
he
turned
away
,
thinking
perhaps
there
had
been
*NL*
an
impertinent
look
in
his
eyes
.
Then
she
put
back
the
little
girl
,
who
*NL*
had
just
been
sick
over
her
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
at
once
came
to
dry
her
,
protesting
that
it
would
n't
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
gives
me
other
doses
,
''
she
said
:
``
I
am
always
a-washing
of
her
.
If
*NL*
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
order
Camus
,
the
grocer
,
to
let
me
have
*NL*
a
little
soap
,
it
would
really
be
more
convenient
for
you
,
as
I
need
n't
*NL*
trouble
you
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
very
well
!
''
said
Emma
.
``
Good
morning
,
Madame
Rollet
,
''
and
*NL*
she
went
out
,
wiping
her
shoes
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
woman
accompanied
her
to
the
end
of
the
garden
,
talking
all
the
*NL*
time
of
the
trouble
she
had
getting
up
of
nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
that
worn
out
sometimes
as
I
drop
asleep
on
my
chair
.
I
'm
sure
you
*NL*
might
at
least
give
me
just
a
pound
of
ground
coffee
;
that
'd
last
me
a
*NL*
month
,
and
I
'd
take
it
of
a
morning
with
some
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
submitted
to
her
thanks
,
Madam
Bovary
left
.
She
had
gone
a
*NL*
little
way
down
the
path
when
,
at
the
sound
of
wooden
shoes
,
she
turned
*NL*
round
.
It
was
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
peasant
woman
,
taking
her
aside
behind
an
elm
tree
,
began
*NL*
talking
to
her
of
her
husband
,
who
with
his
trade
and
six
francs
a
year
*NL*
that
the
captain
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
be
quick
!
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
the
nurse
went
on
,
heaving
sighs
between
each
word
,
``
I
'm
afraid
*NL*
he
'll
be
put
out
seeing
me
have
coffee
alone
,
you
know
men
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
to
have
some
,
''
Emma
repeated
;
``
I
will
give
you
some
.
You
*NL*
bother
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
my
poor
,
dear
lady
!
you
see
in
consequence
of
his
wounds
he
*NL*
has
terrible
cramps
in
the
chest
.
He
even
says
that
cider
weakens
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
make
haste
,
Mere
Rollet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
the
latter
continued
,
making
a
curtsey
,
``
if
it
were
n't
asking
*NL*
too
much
,
''
and
she
curtsied
once
more
,
``
if
you
would
''
--
and
her
eyes
*NL*
begged
--
``
a
jar
of
brandy
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
and
I
'd
rub
your
little
*NL*
one
's
feet
with
it
;
they
're
as
tender
as
one
's
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
rid
of
the
nurse
,
Emma
again
took
Monsieur
Leon
's
arm
.
She
walked
*NL*
fast
for
some
time
,
then
more
slowly
,
and
looking
straight
in
front
of
*NL*
her
,
her
eyes
rested
on
the
shoulder
of
the
young
man
,
whose
frock-coat
*NL*
had
a
black-velvety
collar
.
His
brown
hair
fell
over
it
,
straight
and
*NL*
carefully
arranged
.
She
noticed
his
nails
which
were
longer
than
one
*NL*
wore
them
at
Yonville
.
It
was
one
of
the
clerk
's
chief
occupations
to
*NL*
trim
them
,
and
for
this
purpose
he
kept
a
special
knife
in
his
writing
*NL*
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
to
Yonville
by
the
water-side
.
In
the
warm
season
the
*NL*
bank
,
wider
than
at
other
times
,
showed
to
their
foot
the
garden
walls
*NL*
whence
a
few
steps
led
to
the
river
.
It
flowed
noiselessly
,
swift
,
*NL*
and
cold
to
the
eye
;
long
,
thin
grasses
huddled
together
in
it
as
the
*NL*
current
drove
them
,
and
spread
themselves
upon
the
limpid
water
like
*NL*
streaming
hair
;
sometimes
at
the
tip
of
the
reeds
or
on
the
leaf
of
a
*NL*
water-lily
an
insect
with
fine
legs
crawled
or
rested
.
The
sun
pierced
*NL*
with
a
ray
the
small
blue
bubbles
of
the
waves
that
,
breaking
,
followed
*NL*
each
other
;
branchless
old
willows
mirrored
their
grey
backs
in
*NL*
the
water
;
beyond
,
all
around
,
the
meadows
seemed
empty
.
It
was
the
*NL*
dinner-hour
at
the
farms
,
and
the
young
woman
and
her
companion
heard
*NL*
nothing
as
they
walked
but
the
fall
of
their
steps
on
the
earth
of
the
*NL*
path
,
the
words
they
spoke
,
and
the
sound
of
Emma
's
dress
rustling
round
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walls
of
the
gardens
with
pieces
of
bottle
on
their
coping
were
*NL*
hot
as
the
glass
windows
of
a
conservatory
.
Wallflowers
had
sprung
up
*NL*
between
the
bricks
,
and
with
the
tip
of
her
open
sunshade
Madame
Bovary
,
*NL*
as
she
passed
,
made
some
of
their
faded
flowers
crumble
into
a
yellow
*NL*
dust
,
or
a
spray
of
overhanging
honeysuckle
and
clematis
caught
in
its
*NL*
fringe
and
dangled
for
a
moment
over
the
silk
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
talking
of
a
troupe
of
Spanish
dancers
who
were
expected
*NL*
shortly
at
the
Rouen
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
can
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
they
nothing
else
to
say
to
one
another
?
Yet
their
eyes
were
full
*NL*
of
more
serious
speech
,
and
while
they
forced
themselves
to
find
trivial
*NL*
phrases
,
they
felt
the
same
languor
stealing
over
them
both
.
It
was
the
*NL*
whisper
of
the
soul
,
deep
,
continuous
,
dominating
that
of
their
voices
.
*NL*
Surprised
with
wonder
at
this
strange
sweetness
,
they
did
not
think
of
*NL*
speaking
of
the
sensation
or
of
seeking
its
cause
.
Coming
joys
,
like
*NL*
tropical
shores
,
throw
over
the
immensity
before
them
their
inborn
*NL*
softness
,
an
odorous
wind
,
and
we
are
lulled
by
this
intoxication
*NL*
without
a
thought
of
the
horizon
that
we
do
not
even
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
place
the
ground
had
been
trodden
down
by
the
cattle
;
they
had
to
*NL*
step
on
large
green
stones
put
here
and
there
in
the
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
stopped
a
moment
to
look
where
to
place
her
foot
,
and
*NL*
tottering
on
a
stone
that
shook
,
her
arms
outspread
,
her
form
bent
*NL*
forward
with
a
look
of
indecision
,
she
would
laugh
,
afraid
of
falling
*NL*
into
the
puddles
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
in
front
of
her
garden
,
Madame
Bovary
opened
the
*NL*
little
gate
,
ran
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
returned
to
his
office
.
His
chief
was
away
;
he
just
glanced
at
the
*NL*
briefs
,
then
cut
himself
a
pen
,
and
at
last
took
up
his
hat
and
went
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
La
Pature
at
the
top
of
the
Argueil
hills
at
the
beginning
of
*NL*
the
forest
;
he
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
under
the
pines
and
watched
*NL*
the
sky
through
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
bored
I
am
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
how
bored
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
was
to
be
pitied
for
living
in
this
village
,
with
Homais
*NL*
for
a
friend
and
Monsieru
Guillaumin
for
master
.
The
latter
,
entirely
*NL*
absorbed
by
his
business
,
wearing
gold-rimmed
spectacles
and
red
*NL*
whiskers
over
a
white
cravat
,
understood
nothing
of
mental
refinements
,
*NL*
although
he
affected
a
stiff
English
manner
,
which
in
the
beginning
had
*NL*
impressed
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
chemist
's
spouse
,
she
was
the
best
wife
in
Normandy
,
gentle
*NL*
as
a
sheep
,
loving
her
children
,
her
father
,
her
mother
,
her
cousins
,
*NL*
weeping
for
other
's
woes
,
letting
everything
go
in
her
household
,
and
*NL*
detesting
corsets
;
but
so
slow
of
movement
,
such
a
bore
to
listen
to
,
so
*NL*
common
in
appearance
,
and
of
such
restricted
conversation
,
that
although
*NL*
she
was
thirty
,
he
only
twenty
,
although
they
slept
in
rooms
next
each
*NL*
other
and
he
spoke
to
her
daily
,
he
never
thought
that
she
might
be
a
*NL*
woman
for
another
,
or
that
she
possessed
anything
else
of
her
sex
than
*NL*
the
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
else
was
there
?
Binet
,
a
few
shopkeepers
,
two
or
three
*NL*
publicans
,
the
cure
,
and
finally
,
Monsieur
Tuvache
,
the
mayor
,
with
his
*NL*
two
sons
,
rich
,
crabbed
,
obtuse
persons
,
who
farmed
their
own
lands
*NL*
and
had
feasts
among
themselves
,
bigoted
to
boot
,
and
quite
unbearable
*NL*
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
from
the
general
background
of
all
these
human
faces
Emma
's
stood
*NL*
out
isolated
and
yet
farthest
off
;
for
between
her
and
him
he
seemed
to
*NL*
see
a
vague
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
beginning
he
had
called
on
her
several
times
along
with
the
*NL*
druggist
.
Charles
had
not
appeared
particularly
anxious
to
see
him
*NL*
again
,
and
Leon
did
not
know
what
to
do
between
his
fear
of
being
*NL*
indiscreet
and
the
desire
for
an
intimacy
that
seemed
almost
impossible
.

Chapter
Four
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
cold
days
set
in
Emma
left
her
bedroom
for
the
*NL*
sitting-room
,
a
long
apartment
with
a
low
ceiling
,
in
which
there
was
*NL*
on
the
mantelpiece
a
large
bunch
of
coral
spread
out
against
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
Seated
in
her
arm
chair
near
the
window
,
she
could
see
*NL*
the
villagers
pass
along
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
a
day
Leon
went
from
his
office
to
the
Lion
d'Or
.
Emma
could
hear
*NL*
him
coming
from
afar
;
she
leant
forward
listening
,
and
the
young
man
*NL*
glided
past
the
curtain
,
always
dressed
in
the
same
way
,
and
without
*NL*
turning
his
head
.
But
in
the
twilight
,
when
,
her
chin
resting
on
her
*NL*
left
hand
,
she
let
the
embroidery
she
had
begun
fall
on
her
knees
,
she
*NL*
often
shuddered
at
the
apparition
of
this
shadow
suddenly
gliding
past
.
*NL*
She
would
get
up
and
order
the
table
to
be
laid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Homais
called
at
dinner-time
.
Skull-cap
in
hand
,
he
came
in
on
*NL*
tiptoe
,
in
order
to
disturb
no
one
,
always
repeating
the
same
phrase
,
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
everybody
.
''
Then
,
when
he
had
taken
his
seat
at
the
table
*NL*
between
the
pair
,
he
asked
the
doctor
about
his
patients
,
and
the
latter
*NL*
consulted
his
as
to
the
probability
of
their
payment
.
Next
they
talked
*NL*
of
``
what
was
in
the
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
by
this
hour
knew
it
almost
by
heart
,
and
he
repeated
it
from
end
*NL*
to
end
,
with
the
reflections
of
the
penny-a-liners
,
and
all
the
stories
*NL*
of
individual
catastrophes
that
had
occurred
in
France
or
abroad
.
But
*NL*
the
subject
becoming
exhausted
,
he
was
not
slow
in
throwing
out
some
*NL*
remarks
on
the
dishes
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
even
,
half-rising
,
he
delicately
pointed
out
to
madame
the
*NL*
tenderest
morsel
,
or
turning
to
the
servant
,
gave
her
some
advice
on
the
*NL*
manipulation
of
stews
and
the
hygiene
of
seasoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
aroma
,
osmazome
,
juices
,
and
gelatine
in
a
bewildering
manner
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
Homais
,
with
his
head
fuller
of
recipes
than
his
shop
of
jars
,
*NL*
excelled
in
making
all
kinds
of
preserves
,
vinegars
,
and
sweet
liqueurs
;
*NL*
he
knew
also
all
the
latest
inventions
in
economic
stoves
,
together
with
*NL*
the
art
of
preserving
cheese
and
of
curing
sick
wines
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
Justin
came
to
fetch
him
to
shut
up
the
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Monsieur
Homais
gave
him
a
sly
look
,
especially
if
Felicite
was
*NL*
there
,
for
he
half
noticed
that
his
apprentice
was
fond
of
the
doctor
's
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
dog
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
beginning
to
have
ideas
,
and
the
devil
*NL*
take
me
if
I
do
n't
believe
he
's
in
love
with
your
servant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
more
serious
fault
with
which
he
reproached
Justin
was
his
*NL*
constantly
listening
to
conversation
.
On
Sunday
,
for
example
,
one
could
*NL*
not
get
him
out
of
the
drawing-room
,
whither
Madame
Homais
had
called
*NL*
him
to
fetch
the
children
,
who
were
falling
asleep
in
the
arm-chairs
,
*NL*
and
dragging
down
with
their
backs
calico
chair-covers
that
were
too
*NL*
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
many
people
came
to
these
soirees
at
the
chemist
's
,
his
*NL*
scandal-mongering
and
political
opinions
having
successfully
alienated
*NL*
various
respectable
persons
from
him
.
The
clerk
never
failed
to
be
*NL*
there
.
As
soon
as
he
heard
the
bell
he
ran
to
meet
Madame
Bovary
,
took
*NL*
her
shawl
,
and
put
away
under
the
shop-counter
the
thick
list
shoes
that
*NL*
she
wore
over
her
boots
when
there
was
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
they
played
some
hands
at
trente-et-un
;
next
Monsieur
Homais
*NL*
played
ecarte
with
Emma
;
Leon
behind
her
gave
her
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
up
with
his
hands
on
the
back
of
her
chair
he
saw
the
teeth
of
*NL*
her
comb
that
bit
into
her
chignon
.
With
every
movement
that
she
made
*NL*
to
throw
her
cards
the
right
side
of
her
dress
was
drawn
up
.
From
her
*NL*
turned-up
hair
a
dark
colour
fell
over
her
back
,
and
growing
gradually
*NL*
paler
,
lost
itself
little
by
little
in
the
shade
.
Then
her
dress
fell
*NL*
on
both
sides
of
her
chair
,
puffing
out
full
of
folds
,
and
reached
the
*NL*
ground
.
When
Leon
occasionally
felt
the
sole
of
his
boot
resting
on
it
,
*NL*
he
drew
back
as
if
he
had
trodden
upon
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
game
of
cards
was
over
,
the
druggist
and
the
Doctor
played
*NL*
dominoes
,
and
Emma
,
changing
her
place
,
leant
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
*NL*
turning
over
the
leaves
of
``
L'Illustration
''
.
She
had
brought
her
ladies
'
*NL*
journal
with
her
.
Leon
sat
down
near
her
;
they
looked
at
the
engravings
*NL*
together
,
and
waited
for
one
another
at
the
bottom
of
the
pages
.
She
*NL*
often
begged
him
to
read
her
the
verses
;
Leon
declaimed
them
in
a
*NL*
languid
voice
,
to
which
he
carefully
gave
a
dying
fall
in
the
love
*NL*
passages
.
But
the
noise
of
the
dominoes
annoyed
him
.
Monsieur
Homais
*NL*
was
strong
at
the
game
;
he
could
beat
Charles
and
give
him
a
double-six
.
*NL*
Then
the
three
hundred
finished
,
they
both
stretched
themselves
out
in
*NL*
front
of
the
fire
,
and
were
soon
asleep
.
The
fire
was
dying
out
in
the
*NL*
cinders
;
the
teapot
was
empty
,
Leon
was
still
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
listened
to
him
,
mechanically
turning
around
the
lampshade
,
on
the
*NL*
gauze
of
which
were
painted
clowns
in
carriages
,
and
tight-rope
dances
*NL*
with
their
balancing-poles
.
Leon
stopped
,
pointing
with
a
gesture
to
his
*NL*
sleeping
audience
;
then
they
talked
in
low
tones
,
and
their
conversation
*NL*
seemed
the
more
sweet
to
them
because
it
was
unheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
a
kind
of
bond
was
established
between
them
,
a
constant
commerce
*NL*
of
books
and
of
romances
.
Monsieur
Bovary
,
little
given
to
jealousy
,
did
*NL*
not
trouble
himself
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
birthday
he
received
a
beautiful
phrenological
head
,
all
marked
*NL*
with
figures
to
the
thorax
and
painted
blue
.
This
was
an
attention
of
*NL*
the
clerk
's
.
He
showed
him
many
others
,
even
to
doing
errands
for
him
*NL*
at
Rouen
;
and
the
book
of
a
novelist
having
made
the
mania
for
cactuses
*NL*
fashionable
,
Leon
bought
some
for
Madame
Bovary
,
bringing
them
back
on
*NL*
his
knees
in
the
``
Hirondelle
,
''
pricking
his
fingers
on
their
hard
hairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
board
with
a
balustrade
fixed
against
her
window
to
hold
the
*NL*
pots
.
The
clerk
,
too
,
had
his
small
hanging
garden
;
they
saw
each
other
*NL*
tending
their
flowers
at
their
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
windows
of
the
village
there
was
one
yet
more
often
occupied
;
for
*NL*
on
Sundays
from
morning
to
night
,
and
every
morning
when
the
weather
was
*NL*
bright
,
one
could
see
at
the
dormer-window
of
the
garret
the
profile
of
*NL*
Monsieur
Binet
bending
over
his
lathe
,
whose
monotonous
humming
could
be
*NL*
heard
at
the
Lion
d'Or
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
on
coming
home
Leon
found
in
his
room
a
rug
in
velvet
and
*NL*
wool
with
leaves
on
a
pale
ground
.
He
called
Madame
Homais
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Homais
,
Justin
,
the
children
,
the
cook
;
he
spoke
of
it
to
his
chief
;
*NL*
every
one
wanted
to
see
this
rug
.
Why
did
the
doctor
's
wife
give
the
*NL*
clerk
presents
?
It
looked
queer
.
They
decided
that
she
must
be
his
*NL*
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
this
seem
likely
,
so
ceaselessly
did
he
talk
of
her
charms
and
*NL*
of
her
wit
;
so
much
so
,
that
Binet
once
roughly
answered
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
to
me
since
I
'm
not
in
her
set
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tortured
himself
to
find
out
how
he
could
make
his
declaration
to
*NL*
her
,
and
always
halting
between
the
fear
of
displeasing
her
and
the
*NL*
shame
of
being
such
a
coward
,
he
wept
with
discouragement
and
desire
.
*NL*
Then
he
took
energetic
resolutions
,
wrote
letters
that
he
tore
up
,
put
*NL*
it
off
to
times
that
he
again
deferred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
he
set
out
with
the
determination
to
dare
all
;
but
this
resolution
*NL*
soon
deserted
him
in
Emma
's
presence
,
and
when
Charles
,
dropping
in
,
*NL*
invited
him
to
jump
into
his
chaise
to
go
with
him
to
see
some
patient
*NL*
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
at
once
accepted
,
bowed
to
madame
,
and
went
*NL*
out
.
Her
husband
,
was
he
not
something
belonging
to
her
?
As
to
Emma
,
*NL*
she
did
not
ask
herself
whether
she
loved
.
Love
,
she
thought
,
must
come
*NL*
suddenly
,
with
great
outbursts
and
lightnings
--
a
hurricane
of
the
skies
,
*NL*
which
falls
upon
life
,
revolutionises
it
,
roots
up
the
will
like
a
leaf
,
*NL*
and
sweeps
the
whole
heart
into
the
abyss
.
She
did
not
know
that
on
*NL*
the
terrace
of
houses
it
makes
lakes
when
the
pipes
are
choked
,
and
she
*NL*
would
thus
have
remained
in
her
security
when
she
suddenly
discovered
a
*NL*
rent
in
the
wall
of
it
.

*NL*
Chapter
Five
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
Sunday
in
February
,
an
afternoon
when
the
snow
was
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
all
,
Monsieur
and
Madame
Bovary
,
Homais
,
and
Monsieur
Leon
,
*NL*
gone
to
see
a
yarn-mill
that
was
being
built
in
the
valley
a
mile
and
a
*NL*
half
from
Yonville
.
The
druggist
had
taken
Napoleon
and
Athalie
to
give
*NL*
them
some
exercise
,
and
Justin
accompanied
them
,
carrying
the
umbrellas
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
,
however
,
could
be
less
curious
than
this
curiosity
.
A
great
*NL*
piece
of
waste
ground
,
on
which
pell-mell
,
amid
a
mass
of
sand
and
*NL*
stones
,
were
a
few
break-wheels
,
already
rusty
,
surrounded
by
a
*NL*
quadrangular
building
pierced
by
a
number
of
little
windows
.
The
*NL*
building
was
unfinished
;
the
sky
could
be
seen
through
the
joists
of
the
*NL*
roofing
.
Attached
to
the
stop-plank
of
the
gable
a
bunch
of
straw
mixed
*NL*
with
corn-ears
fluttered
its
tricoloured
ribbons
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
was
talking
.
He
explained
to
the
company
the
future
importance
*NL*
of
this
establishment
,
computed
the
strength
of
the
floorings
,
the
*NL*
thickness
of
the
walls
,
and
regretted
extremely
not
having
a
yard-stick
*NL*
such
as
Monsieur
Binet
possessed
for
his
own
special
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
who
had
taken
his
arm
,
bent
lightly
against
his
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
she
looked
at
the
sun
's
disc
shedding
afar
through
the
mist
his
pale
*NL*
splendour
.
She
turned
.
Charles
was
there
.
His
cap
was
drawn
down
over
*NL*
his
eyebrows
,
and
his
two
thick
lips
were
trembling
,
which
added
a
look
*NL*
of
stupidity
to
his
face
;
his
very
back
,
his
calm
back
,
was
irritating
*NL*
to
behold
,
and
she
saw
written
upon
his
coat
all
the
platitude
of
the
*NL*
bearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
considering
him
thus
,
tasting
in
her
irritation
a
sort
of
*NL*
depraved
pleasure
,
Leon
made
a
step
forward
.
The
cold
that
made
him
pale
*NL*
seemed
to
add
a
more
gentle
languor
to
his
face
;
between
his
cravat
and
*NL*
his
neck
the
somewhat
loose
collar
of
his
shirt
showed
the
skin
;
the
*NL*
lobe
of
his
ear
looked
out
from
beneath
a
lock
of
hair
,
and
his
large
*NL*
blue
eyes
,
raised
to
the
clouds
,
seemed
to
Emma
more
limpid
and
more
*NL*
beautiful
than
those
mountain-lakes
where
the
heavens
are
mirrored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretched
boy
!
''
suddenly
cried
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
ran
to
his
son
,
who
had
just
precipitated
himself
into
a
heap
of
*NL*
lime
in
order
to
whiten
his
boots
.
At
the
reproaches
with
which
he
was
*NL*
being
overwhelmed
Napoleon
began
to
roar
,
while
Justin
dried
his
shoes
*NL*
with
a
wisp
of
straw
.
But
a
knife
was
wanted
;
Charles
offered
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
he
carried
a
knife
in
his
pocket
like
a
*NL*
peasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hoar-frost
was
falling
,
and
they
turned
back
to
Yonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Madame
Bovary
did
not
go
to
her
neighbour
's
,
and
when
*NL*
Charles
had
left
and
she
felt
herself
alone
,
the
comparison
re-began
*NL*
with
the
clearness
of
a
sensation
almost
actual
,
and
with
that
*NL*
lengthening
of
perspective
which
memory
gives
to
things
.
Looking
from
*NL*
her
bed
at
the
clean
fire
that
was
burning
,
she
still
saw
,
as
she
had
*NL*
down
there
,
Leon
standing
up
with
one
hand
behind
his
cane
,
and
with
*NL*
the
other
holding
Athalie
,
who
was
quietly
sucking
a
piece
of
ice
.
She
*NL*
thought
him
charming
;
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
from
him
;
she
*NL*
recalled
his
other
attitudes
on
other
days
,
the
words
he
had
spoken
,
the
*NL*
sound
of
his
voice
,
his
whole
person
;
and
she
repeated
,
pouting
out
her
*NL*
lips
as
if
for
a
kiss
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
charming
!
charming
!
Is
he
not
in
love
?
''
she
asked
herself
;
``
but
*NL*
with
whom
?
With
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
proofs
arose
before
her
at
once
;
her
heart
leapt
.
The
flame
of
*NL*
the
fire
threw
a
joyous
light
upon
the
ceiling
;
she
turned
on
her
back
,
*NL*
stretching
out
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
began
the
eternal
lamentation
:
``
Oh
,
if
Heaven
had
not
willed
it
!
*NL*
And
why
not
?
What
prevented
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Charles
came
home
at
midnight
,
she
seemed
to
have
just
awakened
,
*NL*
and
as
he
made
a
noise
undressing
,
she
complained
of
a
headache
,
then
*NL*
asked
carelessly
what
had
happened
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Leon
,
''
he
said
,
``
went
to
his
room
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
help
smiling
,
and
she
fell
asleep
,
her
soul
filled
with
a
*NL*
new
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
at
dusk
,
she
received
a
visit
from
Monsieur
Lherueux
,
the
*NL*
draper
.
He
was
a
man
of
ability
,
was
this
shopkeeper
.
Born
a
Gascon
but
*NL*
bred
a
Norman
,
he
grafted
upon
his
southern
volubility
the
cunning
of
*NL*
the
Cauchois
.
His
fat
,
flabby
,
beardless
face
seemed
dyed
by
a
*NL*
decoction
of
liquorice
,
and
his
white
hair
made
even
more
vivid
the
*NL*
keen
brilliance
of
his
small
black
eyes
.
No
one
knew
what
he
had
been
*NL*
formerly
;
a
pedlar
said
some
,
a
banker
at
Routot
according
to
others
.
*NL*
What
was
certain
was
that
he
made
complex
calculations
in
his
head
that
*NL*
would
have
frightened
Binet
himself
.
Polite
to
obsequiousness
,
he
always
*NL*
held
himself
with
his
back
bent
in
the
position
of
one
who
bows
or
who
*NL*
invites
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
at
the
door
his
hat
surrounded
with
crape
,
he
put
down
*NL*
a
green
bandbox
on
the
table
,
and
began
by
complaining
to
madame
,
with
*NL*
many
civilities
,
that
he
should
have
remained
till
that
day
without
*NL*
gaining
her
confidence
.
A
poor
shop
like
his
was
not
made
to
attract
*NL*
a
``
fashionable
lady
''
;
he
emphasized
the
words
;
yet
she
had
only
to
*NL*
command
,
and
he
would
undertake
to
provide
her
with
anything
she
might
*NL*
wish
,
either
in
haberdashery
or
linen
,
millinery
or
fancy
goods
,
for
*NL*
he
went
to
town
regularly
four
times
a
month
.
He
was
connected
with
the
*NL*
best
houses
.
You
could
speak
of
him
at
the
``
Trois
Freres
,
''
at
the
``
Barbe
*NL*
d'Or
,
''
or
at
the
``
Grand
Sauvage
''
;
all
these
gentlemen
knew
him
as
*NL*
well
as
the
insides
of
their
pockets
.
To-day
,
then
he
had
come
to
show
*NL*
madame
,
in
passing
,
various
articles
he
happened
to
have
,
thanks
to
*NL*
the
most
rare
opportunity
.
And
he
pulled
out
half-a-dozen
embroidered
*NL*
collars
from
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
examined
them
.
``
I
do
not
require
anything
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Monsieur
Lheureux
delicately
exhibited
three
Algerian
scarves
,
*NL*
several
packets
of
English
needles
,
a
pair
of
straw
slippers
,
and
*NL*
finally
,
four
eggcups
in
cocoanut
wood
,
carved
in
open
work
by
convicts
.
*NL*
Then
,
with
both
hands
on
the
table
,
his
neck
stretched
out
,
his
figure
*NL*
bent
forward
,
open-mouthed
,
he
watched
Emma
's
look
,
who
was
walking
up
*NL*
and
down
undecided
amid
these
goods
.
From
time
to
time
,
as
if
to
remove
*NL*
some
dust
,
he
filliped
with
his
nail
the
silk
of
the
scarves
spread
*NL*
out
at
full
length
,
and
they
rustled
with
a
little
noise
,
making
in
the
*NL*
green
twilight
the
gold
spangles
of
their
tissue
scintillate
like
little
*NL*
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mere
nothing
,
''
he
replied
,
``
a
mere
nothing
.
But
there
's
no
hurry
;
*NL*
whenever
it
's
convenient
.
We
are
not
Jews
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reflected
for
a
few
moments
,
and
ended
by
again
declining
Monsieur
*NL*
Lheureux
's
offer
.
He
replied
quite
unconcernedly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
We
shall
understand
one
another
by
and
by
.
I
have
always
got
*NL*
on
with
ladies
--
if
I
did
n't
with
my
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
tell
you
,
''
he
went
on
good-naturedly
,
after
his
joke
,
``
that
*NL*
it
is
n't
the
money
I
should
trouble
about
.
Why
,
I
could
give
you
some
,
*NL*
if
need
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
he
quickly
and
in
a
low
voice
,
``
I
should
n't
have
to
go
far
to
*NL*
find
you
some
,
rely
on
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
asking
after
Pere
Tellier
,
the
proprietor
of
the
``
Cafe
*NL*
Francais
,
''
whom
Monsieur
Bovary
was
then
attending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
Pere
Tellier
?
He
coughs
so
that
he
shakes
his
*NL*
whole
house
,
and
I
'm
afraid
he
'll
soon
want
a
deal
covering
rather
than
*NL*
a
flannel
vest
.
He
was
such
a
rake
as
a
young
man
!
Those
sort
of
people
,
*NL*
madame
,
have
not
the
least
regularity
;
he
's
burnt
up
with
brandy
.
Still
*NL*
it
's
sad
,
all
the
same
,
to
see
an
acquaintance
go
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
he
fastened
up
his
box
he
discoursed
about
the
doctor
's
*NL*
patients
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
weather
,
no
doubt
,
''
he
said
,
looking
frowningly
at
the
floor
,
*NL*
``
that
causes
these
illnesses
.
I
,
too
,
do
n't
feel
the
thing
.
One
of
these
*NL*
days
I
shall
even
have
to
consult
the
doctor
for
a
pain
I
have
in
my
*NL*
back
.
Well
,
good-bye
,
Madame
Bovary
.
At
your
service
;
your
very
humble
*NL*
servant
.
''
And
he
closed
the
door
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
had
her
dinner
served
in
her
bedroom
on
a
tray
by
the
fireside
;
she
*NL*
was
a
long
time
over
it
;
everything
was
well
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
I
was
!
''
she
said
to
herself
,
thinking
of
the
scarves
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
some
steps
on
the
stairs
.
It
was
Leon
.
She
got
up
and
took
*NL*
from
the
chest
of
drawers
the
first
pile
of
dusters
to
be
hemmed
.
When
*NL*
he
came
in
she
seemed
very
busy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
languished
;
Madame
Bovary
gave
it
up
every
few
minutes
,
*NL*
whilst
he
himself
seemed
quite
embarrassed
.
Seated
on
a
low
chair
near
*NL*
the
fire
,
he
turned
round
in
his
fingers
the
ivory
thimble-case
.
She
*NL*
stitched
on
,
or
from
time
to
time
turned
down
the
hem
of
the
cloth
with
*NL*
her
nail
.
She
did
not
speak
;
he
was
silent
,
captivated
by
her
silence
,
*NL*
as
he
would
have
been
by
her
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
I
displeased
her
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
however
,
Leon
said
that
he
should
have
,
one
of
these
days
,
to
*NL*
go
to
Rouen
on
some
office
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
music
subscription
is
out
;
am
I
to
renew
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
pursing
her
lips
she
slowly
drew
a
long
stitch
of
grey
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
work
irritated
Leon
.
It
seemed
to
roughen
the
ends
of
her
fingers
.
*NL*
A
gallant
phrase
came
into
his
head
,
but
he
did
not
risk
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
giving
it
up
?
''
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
she
asked
hurriedly
.
``
Music
?
Ah
!
yes
!
Have
I
not
my
house
to
*NL*
look
after
,
my
husband
to
attend
to
,
a
thousand
things
,
in
fact
,
many
*NL*
duties
that
must
be
considered
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
clock
.
Charles
was
late
.
Then
,
she
affected
anxiety
.
*NL*
Two
or
three
times
she
even
repeated
,
``
He
is
so
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
was
fond
of
Monsieur
Bovary
.
But
this
tenderness
on
his
behalf
*NL*
astonished
him
unpleasantly
;
nevertheless
he
took
up
on
his
praises
,
*NL*
which
he
said
everyone
was
singing
,
especially
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
he
is
a
good
fellow
,
''
continued
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
replied
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
talking
of
Madame
Homais
,
whose
very
untidy
appearance
*NL*
generally
made
them
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
?
''
interrupted
Emma
.
``
A
good
housewife
does
not
*NL*
trouble
about
her
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
relapsed
into
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
on
the
following
days
;
her
talks
,
her
manners
,
*NL*
everything
changed
.
She
took
interest
in
the
housework
,
went
to
church
*NL*
regularly
,
and
looked
after
her
servant
with
more
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
Berthe
from
nurse
.
When
visitors
called
,
Felicite
brought
her
*NL*
in
,
and
Madame
Bovary
undressed
her
to
show
off
her
limbs
.
She
declared
*NL*
she
adored
children
;
this
was
her
consolation
,
her
joy
,
her
passion
,
*NL*
and
she
accompanied
her
caresses
with
lyrical
outburst
which
would
have
*NL*
reminded
anyone
but
the
Yonville
people
of
Sachette
in
``
Notre
Dame
de
*NL*
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Charles
came
home
he
found
his
slippers
put
to
warm
near
the
fire
.
*NL*
His
waistcoat
now
never
wanted
lining
,
nor
his
shirt
buttons
,
and
it
was
*NL*
quite
a
pleasure
to
see
in
the
cupboard
the
night-caps
arranged
in
piles
*NL*
of
the
same
height
.
She
no
longer
grumbled
as
formerly
at
taking
a
turn
*NL*
in
the
garden
;
what
he
proposed
was
always
done
,
although
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
the
wishes
to
which
she
submitted
without
a
murmur
;
and
when
*NL*
Leon
saw
him
by
his
fireside
after
dinner
,
his
two
hands
on
his
stomach
,
*NL*
his
two
feet
on
the
fender
,
his
two
cheeks
red
with
feeding
,
his
eyes
*NL*
moist
with
happiness
,
the
child
crawling
along
the
carpet
,
and
this
*NL*
woman
with
the
slender
waist
who
came
behind
his
arm-chair
to
kiss
his
*NL*
forehead
:
``
What
madness
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
And
how
to
reach
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
she
seemed
so
virtuous
and
inaccessible
to
him
that
he
lost
all
*NL*
hope
,
even
the
faintest
.
But
by
this
renunciation
he
placed
her
on
*NL*
an
extraordinary
pinnacle
.
To
him
she
stood
outside
those
fleshly
*NL*
attributes
from
which
he
had
nothing
to
obtain
,
and
in
his
heart
she
*NL*
rose
ever
,
and
became
farther
removed
from
him
after
the
magnificent
*NL*
manner
of
an
apotheosis
that
is
taking
wing
.
It
was
one
of
those
pure
*NL*
feelings
that
do
not
interfere
with
life
,
that
are
cultivated
because
*NL*
they
are
rare
,
and
whose
loss
would
afflict
more
than
their
passion
*NL*
rejoices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
grew
thinner
,
her
cheeks
paler
,
her
face
longer
.
With
her
black
*NL*
hair
,
her
large
eyes
,
her
aquiline
nose
,
her
birdlike
walk
,
and
always
*NL*
silent
now
,
did
she
not
seem
to
be
passing
through
life
scarcely
*NL*
touching
it
,
and
to
bear
on
her
brow
the
vague
impress
of
some
divine
*NL*
destiny
?
She
was
so
sad
and
so
calm
,
at
once
so
gentle
and
so
reserved
,
*NL*
that
near
her
one
felt
oneself
seized
by
an
icy
charm
,
as
we
shudder
*NL*
in
churches
at
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
mingling
with
the
cold
of
the
*NL*
marble
.
The
others
even
did
not
escape
from
this
seduction
.
The
chemist
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
woman
of
great
parts
,
who
would
n't
be
misplaced
in
a
*NL*
sub-prefecture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
housewives
admired
her
economy
,
the
patients
her
politeness
,
the
*NL*
poor
her
charity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
eaten
up
with
desires
,
with
rage
,
with
hate
.
That
dress
with
*NL*
the
narrow
folds
hid
a
distracted
fear
,
of
whose
torment
those
chaste
*NL*
lips
said
nothing
.
She
was
in
love
with
Leon
,
and
sought
solitude
that
*NL*
she
might
with
the
more
ease
delight
in
his
image
.
The
sight
of
his
*NL*
form
troubled
the
voluptuousness
of
this
mediation
.
Emma
thrilled
at
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
step
;
then
in
his
presence
the
emotion
subsided
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
there
remained
to
her
only
an
immense
astonishment
that
ended
*NL*
in
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
did
not
know
that
when
he
left
her
in
despair
she
rose
after
he
had
*NL*
gone
to
see
him
in
the
street
.
She
concerned
herself
about
his
comings
*NL*
and
goings
;
she
watched
his
face
;
she
invented
quite
a
history
to
find
*NL*
an
excuse
for
going
to
his
room
.
The
chemist
's
wife
seemed
happy
to
her
*NL*
to
sleep
under
the
same
roof
,
and
her
thoughts
constantly
centered
upon
*NL*
this
house
,
like
the
``
Lion
d'Or
''
pigeons
,
who
came
there
to
dip
their
*NL*
red
feet
and
white
wings
in
its
gutters
.
But
the
more
Emma
recognised
*NL*
her
love
,
the
more
she
crushed
it
down
,
that
it
might
not
be
evident
,
*NL*
that
she
might
make
it
less
.
She
would
have
liked
Leon
to
guess
it
,
and
*NL*
she
imagined
chances
,
catastrophes
that
should
facilitate
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
restrained
her
was
,
no
doubt
,
idleness
and
fear
,
and
a
sense
of
*NL*
shame
also
.
She
thought
she
had
repulsed
him
too
much
,
that
the
time
was
*NL*
past
,
that
all
was
lost
.
Then
,
pride
,
and
joy
of
being
able
to
say
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
I
am
virtuous
,
''
and
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
taking
*NL*
resigned
poses
,
consoled
her
a
little
for
the
sacrifice
she
believed
she
*NL*
was
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
,
the
longing
for
money
,
and
the
melancholy
*NL*
of
passion
all
blended
themselves
into
one
suffering
,
and
instead
of
*NL*
turning
her
thoughts
from
it
,
she
clave
to
it
the
more
,
urging
herself
*NL*
to
pain
,
and
seeking
everywhere
occasion
for
it
.
She
was
irritated
by
*NL*
an
ill-served
dish
or
by
a
half-open
door
;
bewailed
the
velvets
she
had
*NL*
not
,
the
happiness
she
had
missed
,
her
too
exalted
dreams
,
her
narrow
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
exasperated
her
was
that
Charles
did
not
seem
to
notice
her
*NL*
anguish
.
His
conviction
that
he
was
making
her
happy
seemed
to
her
an
*NL*
imbecile
insult
,
and
his
sureness
on
this
point
ingratitude
.
For
whose
*NL*
sake
,
then
was
she
virtuous
?
Was
it
not
for
him
,
the
obstacle
to
all
*NL*
felicity
,
the
cause
of
all
misery
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
the
sharp
clasp
of
*NL*
that
complex
strap
that
bucked
her
in
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
him
alone
,
then
,
she
concentrated
all
the
various
hatreds
that
*NL*
resulted
from
her
boredom
,
and
every
effort
to
diminish
only
augmented
*NL*
it
;
for
this
useless
trouble
was
added
to
the
other
reasons
for
despair
,
*NL*
and
contributed
still
more
to
the
separation
between
them
.
Her
own
*NL*
gentleness
to
herself
made
her
rebel
against
him
.
Domestic
mediocrity
*NL*
drove
her
to
lewd
fancies
,
marriage
tenderness
to
adulterous
desires
.
*NL*
She
would
have
liked
Charles
to
beat
her
,
that
she
might
have
a
better
*NL*
right
to
hate
him
,
to
revenge
herself
upon
him
.
She
was
surprised
*NL*
sometimes
at
the
atrocious
conjectures
that
came
into
her
thoughts
,
and
*NL*
she
had
to
go
on
smiling
,
to
hear
repeated
to
her
at
all
hours
that
she
*NL*
was
happy
,
to
pretend
to
be
happy
,
to
let
it
be
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
she
had
loathing
of
this
hypocrisy
.
She
was
seized
with
the
*NL*
temptation
to
flee
somewhere
with
Leon
to
try
a
new
life
;
but
at
once
a
*NL*
vague
chasm
full
of
darkness
opened
within
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
he
no
longer
loves
me
,
''
she
thought
.
``
What
is
to
become
of
me
?
*NL*
What
help
is
to
be
hoped
for
,
what
consolation
,
what
solace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
left
broken
,
breathless
,
inert
,
sobbing
in
a
low
voice
,
with
*NL*
flowing
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
tell
master
?
''
the
servant
asked
her
when
she
came
in
*NL*
during
these
crises
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
nerves
,
''
said
Emma
.
``
Do
not
speak
to
him
of
it
;
it
would
*NL*
worry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
,
''
Felicite
went
on
,
``
you
are
just
like
La
Guerine
,
Pere
*NL*
Guerin
's
daughter
,
the
fisherman
at
Pollet
,
that
I
used
to
know
at
*NL*
Dieppe
before
I
came
to
you
.
She
was
so
sad
,
so
sad
,
to
see
her
*NL*
standing
upright
on
the
threshold
of
her
house
,
she
seemed
to
you
like
a
*NL*
winding-sheet
spread
out
before
the
door
.
Her
illness
,
it
appears
,
was
*NL*
a
kind
of
fog
that
she
had
in
her
head
,
and
the
doctors
could
not
do
*NL*
anything
,
nor
the
priest
either
.
When
she
was
taken
too
bad
she
went
*NL*
off
quite
alone
to
the
sea-shore
,
so
that
the
customs
officer
,
going
his
*NL*
rounds
,
often
found
her
lying
flat
on
her
face
,
crying
on
the
shingle
.
*NL*
Then
,
after
her
marriage
,
it
went
off
,
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
with
me
,
''
replied
Emma
,
``
it
was
after
marriage
that
it
began

Chapter
Six
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
the
window
was
open
,
and
she
,
sitting
by
it
,
had
been
*NL*
watching
Lestiboudois
,
the
beadle
,
trimming
the
box
,
she
suddenly
heard
*NL*
the
Angelus
ringing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
April
,
when
the
primroses
are
in
bloom
,
and
a
*NL*
warm
wind
blows
over
the
flower-beds
newly
turned
,
and
the
gardens
,
like
*NL*
women
,
seem
to
be
getting
ready
for
the
summer
fetes
.
Through
the
bars
*NL*
of
the
arbour
and
away
beyond
the
river
seen
in
the
fields
,
meandering
*NL*
through
the
grass
in
wandering
curves
.
The
evening
vapours
rose
between
*NL*
the
leafless
poplars
,
touching
their
outlines
with
a
violet
tint
,
paler
*NL*
and
more
transparent
than
a
subtle
gauze
caught
athwart
their
branches
.
*NL*
In
the
distance
cattle
moved
about
;
neither
their
steps
nor
their
lowing
*NL*
could
be
heard
;
and
the
bell
,
still
ringing
through
the
air
,
kept
up
its
*NL*
peaceful
lamentation
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
repeated
tinkling
the
thoughts
of
the
young
woman
lost
*NL*
themselves
in
old
memories
of
her
youth
and
school-days
.
She
remembered
*NL*
the
great
candlesticks
that
rose
above
the
vases
full
of
flowers
on
the
*NL*
altar
,
and
the
tabernacle
with
its
small
columns
.
She
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
be
once
more
lost
in
the
long
line
of
white
veils
,
marked
off
here
*NL*
and
there
by
the
stuff
black
hoods
of
the
good
sisters
bending
over
*NL*
their
prie-Dieu
.
At
mass
on
Sundays
,
when
she
looked
up
,
she
saw
the
*NL*
gentle
face
of
the
Virgin
amid
the
blue
smoke
of
the
rising
incense
.
*NL*
Then
she
was
moved
;
she
felt
herself
weak
and
quite
deserted
,
like
the
*NL*
down
of
a
bird
whirled
by
the
tempest
,
and
it
was
unconsciously
that
she
*NL*
went
towards
the
church
,
included
to
no
matter
what
devotions
,
so
that
*NL*
her
soul
was
absorbed
and
all
existence
lost
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Place
she
met
Lestivoudois
on
his
way
back
,
for
,
in
order
not
*NL*
to
shorten
his
day
's
labour
,
he
preferred
interrupting
his
work
,
*NL*
then
beginning
it
again
,
so
that
he
rang
the
Angelus
to
suit
his
own
*NL*
convenience
.
Besides
,
the
ringing
over
a
little
earlier
warned
the
lads
*NL*
of
catechism
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
a
few
who
had
arrived
were
playing
marbles
on
the
stones
of
the
*NL*
cemetery
.
Others
,
astride
the
wall
,
swung
their
legs
,
kicking
with
their
*NL*
clogs
the
large
nettles
growing
between
the
little
enclosure
and
the
*NL*
newest
graves
.
This
was
the
only
green
spot
.
All
the
rest
was
but
*NL*
stones
,
always
covered
with
a
fine
powder
,
despite
the
vestry-broom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
in
list
shoes
ran
about
there
as
if
it
were
an
enclosure
*NL*
made
for
them
.
The
shouts
of
their
voices
could
be
heard
through
the
*NL*
humming
of
the
bell
.
This
grew
less
and
less
with
the
swinging
of
the
*NL*
great
rope
that
,
hanging
from
the
top
of
the
belfry
,
dragged
its
end
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
Swallows
flitted
to
and
fro
uttering
little
cries
,
cut
the
*NL*
air
with
the
edge
of
their
wings
,
and
swiftly
returned
to
their
yellow
*NL*
nests
under
the
tiles
of
the
coping
.
At
the
end
of
the
church
a
lamp
was
*NL*
burning
,
the
wick
of
a
night-light
in
a
glass
hung
up
.
Its
light
from
a
*NL*
distance
looked
like
a
white
stain
trembling
in
the
oil
.
A
long
ray
of
*NL*
the
sun
fell
across
the
nave
and
seemed
to
darken
the
lower
sides
and
*NL*
the
corners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
cure
?
''
asked
Madame
Bovary
of
one
of
the
lads
,
who
was
*NL*
amusing
himself
by
shaking
a
swivel
in
a
hole
too
large
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
just
coming
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
fact
the
door
of
the
presbytery
grated
;
Abbe
Bournisien
appeared
;
*NL*
the
children
,
pell-mell
,
fled
into
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
young
scamps
!
''
murmured
the
priest
,
``
always
the
same
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
picking
up
a
catechism
all
in
rags
that
he
had
struck
with
is
*NL*
foot
,
``
They
respect
nothing
!
''
But
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
Madame
*NL*
Bovary
,
``
Excuse
me
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
did
not
recognise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
the
catechism
into
his
pocket
,
and
stopped
short
,
balancing
*NL*
the
heavy
vestry
key
between
his
two
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
of
the
setting
sun
that
fell
full
upon
his
face
paled
the
*NL*
lasting
of
his
cassock
,
shiny
at
the
elbows
,
unravelled
at
the
hem
.
*NL*
Grease
and
tobacco
stains
followed
along
his
broad
chest
the
lines
*NL*
of
the
buttons
,
and
grew
more
numerous
the
farther
they
were
from
his
*NL*
neckcloth
,
in
which
the
massive
folds
of
his
red
chin
rested
;
this
was
*NL*
dotted
with
yellow
spots
,
that
disappeared
beneath
the
coarse
hair
of
*NL*
his
greyish
beard
.
He
had
just
dined
and
was
breathing
noisily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
well
,
''
replied
Emma
;
``
I
am
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
so
am
I
,
''
answered
the
priest
.
``
These
first
warm
days
weaken
*NL*
one
most
remarkably
,
do
n't
they
?
But
,
after
all
,
we
are
born
to
suffer
,
*NL*
as
St.
Paul
says
.
But
what
does
Monsieur
Bovary
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
''
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
replied
the
good
fellow
,
quite
astonished
,
``
does
n't
he
prescribe
*NL*
something
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Emma
,
``
it
is
no
earthly
remedy
I
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
cure
from
time
to
time
looked
into
the
church
,
where
the
*NL*
kneeling
boys
were
shouldering
one
another
,
and
tumbling
over
like
packs
*NL*
of
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
--
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
out
,
Riboudet
,
''
cried
the
priest
in
an
angry
voice
;
``
I
'll
warm
*NL*
your
ears
,
you
imp
!
''
Then
turning
to
Emma
,
``
He
's
Boudet
the
carpenter
's
*NL*
son
;
his
parents
are
well
off
,
and
let
him
do
just
as
he
pleases
.
Yet
he
*NL*
could
learn
quickly
if
he
would
,
for
he
is
very
sharp
.
And
so
sometimes
*NL*
for
a
joke
I
call
him
Riboudet
-LRB-
like
the
road
one
takes
to
go
to
*NL*
Maromme
-RRB-
and
I
even
say
`
Mon
Riboudet
.
'
Ha
!
Ha
!
`
Mont
Riboudet
.
'
The
*NL*
other
day
I
repeated
that
just
to
Monsignor
,
and
he
laughed
at
it
;
he
*NL*
condescended
to
laugh
at
it
.
And
how
is
Monsieur
Bovary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
not
to
hear
him
.
And
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
very
busy
,
no
doubt
;
for
he
and
I
are
certainly
the
busiest
*NL*
people
in
the
parish
.
But
he
is
doctor
of
the
body
,
''
he
added
with
a
*NL*
thick
laugh
,
``
and
I
of
the
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fixed
her
pleading
eyes
upon
the
priest
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
*NL*
solace
all
sorrows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
do
n't
talk
to
me
of
it
,
Madame
Bovary
.
This
morning
I
had
to
go
to
*NL*
Bas-Diauville
for
a
cow
that
was
ill
;
they
thought
it
was
under
a
spell
.
*NL*
All
their
cows
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
--
But
pardon
me
!
Longuemarre
and
*NL*
Boudet
!
Bless
me
!
Will
you
leave
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
bound
he
ran
into
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
were
just
then
clustering
round
the
large
desk
,
climbing
over
*NL*
the
precentor
's
footstool
,
opening
the
missal
;
and
others
on
tiptoe
were
*NL*
just
about
to
venture
into
the
confessional
.
But
the
priest
suddenly
*NL*
distributed
a
shower
of
cuffs
among
them
.
Seizing
them
by
the
collars
of
*NL*
their
coats
,
he
lifted
them
from
the
ground
,
and
deposited
them
on
their
*NL*
knees
on
the
stones
of
the
choir
,
firmly
,
as
if
he
meant
planting
them
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
when
he
returned
to
Emma
,
unfolding
his
large
cotton
*NL*
handkerchief
,
one
corner
of
which
he
put
between
his
teeth
,
``
farmers
are
*NL*
much
to
be
pitied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Others
,
too
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
.
Town-labourers
,
for
example
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
they
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
!
I
've
there
known
poor
mothers
of
families
,
virtuous
women
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
real
saints
,
who
wanted
even
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
those
,
''
replied
Emma
,
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
twitched
as
she
*NL*
spoke
,
``
those
,
Monsieur
le
Cure
,
who
have
bread
and
have
no
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
in
the
winter
,
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
does
that
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
What
does
it
matter
?
It
seems
to
me
that
when
one
has
firing
and
*NL*
food
--
for
,
after
all
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
my
God
!
''
she
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indigestion
,
no
doubt
?
You
must
get
home
,
Madame
Bovary
;
drink
*NL*
a
little
tea
,
that
will
strengthen
you
,
or
else
a
glass
of
fresh
water
*NL*
with
a
little
moist
sugar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
And
she
looked
like
one
awaking
from
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
you
were
putting
your
hand
to
your
forehead
.
I
thought
*NL*
you
felt
faint
.
''
Then
,
bethinking
himself
,
``
But
you
were
asking
me
*NL*
something
?
What
was
it
?
I
really
do
n't
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Nothing
!
nothing
!
''
repeated
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
glance
she
cast
round
her
slowly
fell
upon
the
old
man
in
the
*NL*
cassock
.
They
looked
at
one
another
face
to
face
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Madame
Bovary
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
excuse
me
,
but
duty
first
,
you
*NL*
know
;
I
must
look
after
my
good-for-nothings
.
The
first
communion
will
*NL*
soon
be
upon
us
,
and
I
fear
we
shall
be
behind
after
all
.
So
after
*NL*
Ascension
Day
I
keep
them
recta
*
an
extra
hour
every
Wednesday
.
Poor
*NL*
children
!
One
can
not
lead
them
too
soon
into
the
path
of
the
Lord
,
as
,
*NL*
moreover
,
he
has
himself
recommended
us
to
do
by
the
mouth
of
his
Divine
*NL*
Son
.
Good
health
to
you
,
madame
;
my
respects
to
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
On
the
straight
and
narrow
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
into
the
church
making
a
genuflexion
as
soon
as
he
reached
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
saw
him
disappear
between
the
double
row
of
forms
,
walking
with
a
*NL*
heavy
tread
,
his
head
a
little
bent
over
his
shoulder
,
and
with
his
two
*NL*
hands
half-open
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
turned
on
her
heel
all
of
one
piece
,
like
a
statue
on
a
pivot
,
*NL*
and
went
homewards
.
But
the
loud
voice
of
the
priest
,
the
clear
voices
*NL*
of
the
boys
still
reached
her
ears
,
and
went
on
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
Christian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
a
Christian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
Christian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
who
,
being
baptized-baptized-baptized
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
the
steps
of
the
staircase
holding
on
to
the
banisters
,
and
*NL*
when
she
was
in
her
room
threw
herself
into
an
arm-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whitish
light
of
the
window-panes
fell
with
soft
undulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
furniture
in
its
place
seemed
to
have
become
more
immobile
,
and
to
*NL*
lose
itself
in
the
shadow
as
in
an
ocean
of
darkness
.
The
fire
was
out
,
*NL*
the
clock
went
on
ticking
,
and
Emma
vaguely
marvelled
at
this
calm
of
*NL*
all
things
while
within
herself
was
such
tumult
.
But
little
Berthe
was
*NL*
there
,
between
the
window
and
the
work-table
,
tottering
on
her
knitted
*NL*
shoes
,
and
trying
to
come
to
her
mother
to
catch
hold
of
the
ends
of
her
*NL*
apron-strings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
,
''
said
the
latter
,
putting
her
from
her
with
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
soon
came
up
closer
against
her
knees
,
and
leaning
on
*NL*
them
with
her
arms
,
she
looked
up
with
her
large
blue
eyes
,
while
a
*NL*
small
thread
of
pure
saliva
dribbled
from
her
lips
on
to
the
silk
apron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
,
''
repeated
the
young
woman
quite
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
frightened
the
child
,
who
began
to
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
leave
me
alone
?
''
she
said
,
pushing
her
with
her
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berthe
fell
at
the
foot
of
the
drawers
against
the
brass
handle
,
cutting
*NL*
her
cheek
,
which
began
to
bleed
,
against
it
.
Madame
Bovary
sprang
to
*NL*
lift
her
up
,
broke
the
bell-rope
,
called
for
the
servant
with
all
her
*NL*
might
,
and
she
was
just
going
to
curse
herself
when
Charles
appeared
.
It
*NL*
was
the
dinner-hour
;
he
had
come
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
dear
!
''
said
Emma
,
in
a
calm
voice
,
``
the
little
one
fell
down
*NL*
while
she
was
playing
,
and
has
hurt
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
reassured
her
;
the
case
was
not
a
serious
one
,
and
he
went
for
*NL*
some
sticking
plaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
did
not
go
downstairs
to
the
dining-room
;
she
wished
*NL*
to
remain
alone
to
look
after
the
child
.
Then
watching
her
sleep
,
the
*NL*
little
anxiety
she
felt
gradually
wore
off
,
and
she
seemed
very
stupid
*NL*
to
herself
,
and
very
good
to
have
been
so
worried
just
now
at
so
little
.
*NL*
Berthe
,
in
fact
,
no
longer
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
breathing
now
imperceptibly
raised
the
cotton
covering
.
Big
tears
*NL*
lay
in
the
corner
of
the
half-closed
eyelids
,
through
whose
lashes
one
*NL*
could
see
two
pale
sunken
pupils
;
the
plaster
stuck
on
her
cheek
drew
*NL*
the
skin
obliquely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
strange
,
''
thought
Emma
,
``
how
ugly
this
child
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
eleven
o'clock
Charles
came
back
from
the
chemist
's
shop
,
*NL*
whither
he
had
gone
after
dinner
to
return
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
sticking-plaster
,
he
found
his
wife
standing
by
the
cradle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
it
's
nothing
.
''
he
said
,
kissing
her
on
the
forehead
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
,
my
poor
darling
;
you
will
make
yourself
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stayed
a
long
time
at
the
chemist
's
.
Although
he
had
not
seemed
*NL*
much
moved
,
Homais
,
nevertheless
,
had
exerted
himself
to
buoy
him
up
,
to
*NL*
``
keep
up
his
spirits
.
''
Then
they
had
talked
of
the
various
dangers
that
*NL*
threaten
childhood
,
of
the
carelessness
of
servants
.
Madame
Homais
knew
*NL*
something
of
it
,
having
still
upon
her
chest
the
marks
left
by
a
basin
*NL*
full
of
soup
that
a
cook
had
formerly
dropped
on
her
pinafore
,
and
*NL*
her
good
parents
took
no
end
of
trouble
for
her
.
The
knives
were
not
*NL*
sharpened
,
nor
the
floors
waxed
;
there
were
iron
gratings
to
the
windows
*NL*
and
strong
bars
across
the
fireplace
;
the
little
Homais
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
their
spirit
,
could
not
stir
without
someone
watching
them
;
at
the
*NL*
slightest
cold
their
father
stuffed
them
with
pectorals
;
and
until
*NL*
they
were
turned
four
they
all
,
without
pity
,
had
to
wear
wadded
*NL*
head-protectors
.
This
,
it
is
true
,
was
a
fancy
of
Madame
Homais
'
;
her
*NL*
husband
was
inwardly
afflicted
at
it
.
Fearing
the
possible
consequences
*NL*
of
such
compression
to
the
intellectual
organs
.
He
even
went
so
far
as
*NL*
to
say
to
her
,
``
Do
you
want
to
make
Caribs
or
Botocudos
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
however
,
had
several
times
tried
to
interrupt
the
conversation
.
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
speak
to
you
,
''
he
had
whispered
in
the
clerk
's
ear
,
*NL*
who
went
upstairs
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
he
suspect
anything
?
''
Leon
asked
himself
.
His
heart
beat
,
and
he
*NL*
racked
his
brain
with
surmises
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
Charles
,
having
shut
the
door
,
asked
him
to
see
himself
*NL*
what
would
be
the
price
at
Rouen
of
a
fine
daguerreotypes
.
It
was
a
*NL*
sentimental
surprise
he
intended
for
his
wife
,
a
delicate
attention
--
his
*NL*
portrait
in
a
frock-coat
.
But
he
wanted
first
to
know
``
how
much
it
would
*NL*
be
.
''
The
inquiries
would
not
put
Monsieur
Leon
out
,
since
he
went
to
*NL*
town
almost
every
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
?
Monsieur
Homais
suspected
some
``
young
man
's
affair
''
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
it
,
an
intrigue
.
But
he
was
mistaken
.
Leon
was
after
no
love-making
.
*NL*
He
was
sadder
than
ever
,
as
Madame
Lefrancois
saw
from
the
amount
of
*NL*
food
he
left
on
his
plate
.
To
find
out
more
about
it
she
questioned
*NL*
the
tax-collector
.
Binet
answered
roughly
that
he
``
was
n't
paid
by
the
*NL*
police
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
same
,
his
companion
seemed
very
strange
to
him
,
for
Leon
often
*NL*
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
and
stretching
out
his
arms
,
complained
vaguely
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
you
do
n't
take
enough
recreation
,
''
said
the
collector
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
recreation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
I
'd
have
a
lathe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
know
how
to
turn
,
''
answered
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
's
true
,
''
said
the
other
,
rubbing
his
chin
with
an
air
of
*NL*
mingled
contempt
and
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
was
weary
of
loving
without
any
result
;
moreover
he
was
beginning
*NL*
to
feel
that
depression
caused
by
the
repetition
of
the
same
kind
of
*NL*
life
,
when
no
interest
inspires
and
no
hope
sustains
it
.
He
was
so
bored
*NL*
with
Yonville
and
its
inhabitants
,
that
the
sight
of
certain
persons
,
*NL*
of
certain
houses
,
irritated
him
beyond
endurance
;
and
the
chemist
,
good
*NL*
fellow
though
he
was
,
was
becoming
absolutely
unbearable
to
him
.
Yet
*NL*
the
prospect
of
a
new
condition
of
life
frightened
as
much
as
it
seduced
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
apprehension
soon
changed
into
impatience
,
and
then
Paris
from
afar
*NL*
sounded
its
fanfare
of
masked
balls
with
the
laugh
of
grisettes
.
As
he
*NL*
was
to
finish
reading
there
,
why
not
set
out
at
once
?
What
prevented
*NL*
him
?
And
he
began
making
home-preparations
;
he
arranged
his
occupations
*NL*
beforehand
.
He
furnished
in
his
head
an
apartment
.
He
would
lead
an
*NL*
artist
's
life
there
!
He
would
take
lessons
on
the
guitar
!
He
would
have
*NL*
a
dressing-gown
,
a
Basque
cap
,
blue
velvet
slippers
!
He
even
already
was
*NL*
admiring
two
crossed
foils
over
his
chimney-piece
,
with
a
death
's
head
*NL*
on
the
guitar
above
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
difficulty
was
the
consent
of
his
mother
;
nothing
,
however
,
seemed
*NL*
more
reasonable
.
Even
his
employer
advised
him
to
go
to
some
other
*NL*
chambers
where
he
could
advance
more
rapidly
.
Taking
a
middle
course
,
*NL*
then
,
Leon
looked
for
some
place
as
second
clerk
at
Rouen
;
found
none
,
*NL*
and
at
last
wrote
his
mother
a
long
letter
full
of
details
,
in
which
*NL*
he
set
forth
the
reasons
for
going
to
live
at
Paris
immediately
.
She
*NL*
consented
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
hurry
.
Every
day
for
a
month
Hivert
carried
boxes
,
valises
,
*NL*
parcels
for
him
from
Yonville
to
Rouen
and
from
Rouen
to
Yonville
;
*NL*
and
when
Leon
had
packed
up
his
wardrobe
,
had
his
three
arm-chairs
*NL*
restuffed
,
bought
a
stock
of
neckties
,
in
a
word
,
had
made
more
*NL*
preparations
than
for
a
voyage
around
the
world
,
he
put
it
off
from
week
*NL*
to
week
,
until
he
received
a
second
letter
from
his
mother
urging
him
to
*NL*
leave
,
since
he
wanted
to
pass
his
examination
before
the
vacation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
moment
for
the
farewells
had
come
,
Madame
Homais
wept
,
Justin
*NL*
sobbed
;
Homais
,
as
a
man
of
nerve
,
concealed
his
emotion
;
he
wished
to
*NL*
carry
his
friend
's
overcoat
himself
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
notary
,
*NL*
who
was
taking
Leon
to
Rouen
in
his
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
had
just
time
to
bid
farewell
to
Monsieur
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
he
stopped
,
he
was
so
out
of
*NL*
breath
.
As
he
came
in
,
Madame
Bovary
arose
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
again
!
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bit
her
lips
,
and
a
rush
of
blood
flowing
under
her
skin
made
her
*NL*
red
from
the
roots
of
her
hair
to
the
top
of
her
collar
.
She
remained
*NL*
standing
,
leaning
with
her
shoulder
against
the
wainscot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
is
not
here
?
''
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
out
.
''
She
repeated
,
``
He
is
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
silence
.
They
looked
at
one
another
and
their
thoughts
,
*NL*
confounded
in
the
same
agony
,
clung
close
together
like
two
throbbing
*NL*
breasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
kiss
Berthe
,
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
went
down
a
few
steps
and
called
Felicite
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
one
long
look
around
him
that
took
in
the
walls
,
the
*NL*
decorations
,
the
fireplace
,
as
if
to
penetrate
everything
,
carry
away
*NL*
everything
.
But
she
returned
,
and
the
servant
brought
Berthe
,
who
was
*NL*
swinging
a
windmill
roof
downwards
at
the
end
of
a
string
.
Leon
kissed
*NL*
her
several
times
on
the
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
poor
child
!
good-bye
,
dear
little
one
!
good-bye
!
''
And
he
gave
*NL*
her
back
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
her
away
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
remained
alone
--
Madame
Bovary
,
her
back
turned
,
her
face
pressed
*NL*
against
a
window-pane
;
Leon
held
his
cap
in
his
hand
,
knocking
it
softly
*NL*
against
his
thigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
going
to
rain
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
cloak
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
around
,
her
chin
lowered
,
her
forehead
bent
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
fell
on
it
as
on
a
piece
of
marble
,
to
the
curve
of
the
*NL*
eyebrows
,
without
one
's
being
able
to
guess
what
Emma
was
seeing
on
the
*NL*
horizon
or
what
she
was
thinking
within
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-bye
,
''
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
head
with
a
quick
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
good-bye
--
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
advanced
towards
each
other
;
he
held
out
his
hand
;
she
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
English
fashion
,
then
,
''
she
said
,
giving
her
own
hand
wholly
to
*NL*
him
,
and
forcing
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
felt
it
between
his
fingers
,
and
the
very
essence
of
all
his
being
*NL*
seemed
to
pass
down
into
that
moist
palm
.
Then
he
opened
his
hand
;
their
*NL*
eyes
met
again
,
and
he
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
market-place
,
he
stopped
and
hid
behind
a
pillar
to
*NL*
look
for
the
last
time
at
this
white
house
with
the
four
green
blinds
.
*NL*
He
thought
he
saw
a
shadow
behind
the
window
in
the
room
;
but
the
*NL*
curtain
,
sliding
along
the
pole
as
though
no
one
were
touching
it
,
*NL*
slowly
opened
its
long
oblique
folds
that
spread
out
with
a
single
*NL*
movement
,
and
thus
hung
straight
and
motionless
as
a
plaster
wall
.
Leon
*NL*
set
off
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
afar
he
saw
his
employer
's
gig
in
the
road
,
and
by
it
a
man
in
*NL*
a
coarse
apron
holding
the
horse
.
Homais
and
Monsieur
Guillaumin
were
*NL*
talking
.
They
were
waiting
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Embrace
me
,
''
said
the
druggist
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
``
Here
is
your
*NL*
coat
,
my
good
friend
.
Mind
the
cold
;
take
care
of
yourself
;
look
after
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Leon
,
jump
in
,
''
said
the
notary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
bent
over
the
splash-board
,
and
in
a
voice
broken
by
sobs
uttered
*NL*
these
three
sad
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pleasant
journey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
said
Monsieur
Guillaumin
.
``
Give
him
his
head
.
''
They
set
*NL*
out
,
and
Homais
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
had
opened
her
window
overlooking
the
garden
and
watched
*NL*
the
clouds
.
They
gathered
around
the
sunset
on
the
side
of
Rouen
and
*NL*
then
swiftly
rolled
back
their
black
columns
,
behind
which
the
great
*NL*
rays
of
the
sun
looked
out
like
the
golden
arrows
of
a
suspended
trophy
,
*NL*
while
the
rest
of
the
empty
heavens
was
white
as
porcelain
.
But
a
gust
*NL*
of
wind
bowed
the
poplars
,
and
suddenly
the
rain
fell
;
it
pattered
*NL*
against
the
green
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
sun
reappeared
,
the
hens
clucked
,
sparrows
shook
their
wings
in
*NL*
the
damp
thickets
,
and
the
pools
of
water
on
the
gravel
as
they
flowed
*NL*
away
carried
off
the
pink
flowers
of
an
acacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
how
far
off
he
must
be
already
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Homais
,
as
usual
,
came
at
half-past
six
during
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
so
we
've
sent
off
our
young
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
seems
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
Then
turning
on
his
chair
;
``
Any
news
*NL*
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
much
.
Only
my
wife
was
a
little
moved
this
afternoon
.
You
know
*NL*
women
--
a
nothing
upsets
them
,
especially
my
wife
.
And
we
should
be
*NL*
wrong
to
object
to
that
,
since
their
nervous
organization
is
much
more
*NL*
malleable
than
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Leon
!
''
said
Charles
.
``
How
will
he
live
at
Paris
?
Will
he
get
used
*NL*
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
along
!
''
said
the
chemist
,
smacking
his
lips
.
``
The
outings
at
*NL*
restaurants
,
the
masked
balls
,
the
champagne
--
all
that
'll
be
jolly
*NL*
enough
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
he
'll
go
wrong
,
''
objected
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
do
I
,
''
said
Monsieur
Homais
quickly
;
``
although
he
'll
have
to
do
*NL*
like
the
rest
for
fear
of
passing
for
a
Jesuit
.
And
you
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
a
life
those
dogs
lead
in
the
Latin
quarter
with
actresses
.
Besides
,
*NL*
students
are
thought
a
great
deal
of
in
Paris
.
Provided
they
have
a
few
*NL*
accomplishments
,
they
are
received
in
the
best
society
;
there
are
even
*NL*
ladies
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
who
fall
in
love
with
them
,
which
*NL*
subsequently
furnishes
them
opportunities
for
making
very
good
matches
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
I
fear
for
him
that
down
there
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
interrupted
the
chemist
;
``
that
is
the
reverse
of
the
*NL*
medal
.
And
one
is
constantly
obliged
to
keep
one
's
hand
in
one
's
pocket
*NL*
there
.
Thus
,
we
will
suppose
you
are
in
a
public
garden
.
An
individual
*NL*
presents
himself
,
well
dressed
,
even
wearing
an
order
,
and
whom
one
*NL*
would
take
for
a
diplomatist
.
He
approaches
you
,
he
insinuates
himself
;
*NL*
offers
you
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
or
picks
up
your
hat
.
Then
you
become
more
*NL*
intimate
;
he
takes
you
to
a
cafe
,
invites
you
to
his
country-house
,
*NL*
introduces
you
,
between
two
drinks
,
to
all
sorts
of
people
;
and
*NL*
three-fourths
of
the
time
it
's
only
to
plunder
your
watch
or
lead
you
*NL*
into
some
pernicious
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Charles
;
``
but
I
was
thinking
especially
of
*NL*
illnesses
--
of
typhoid
fever
,
for
example
,
that
attacks
students
from
the
*NL*
provinces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
of
the
change
of
regimen
,
''
continued
the
chemist
,
``
and
of
the
*NL*
perturbation
that
results
therefrom
in
the
whole
system
.
And
then
the
*NL*
water
at
Paris
,
do
n't
you
know
!
The
dishes
at
restaurants
,
all
the
*NL*
spiced
food
,
end
by
heating
the
blood
,
and
are
not
worth
,
whatever
*NL*
people
may
say
of
them
,
a
good
soup
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
have
always
*NL*
preferred
plain
living
;
it
is
more
healthy
.
So
when
I
was
studying
*NL*
pharmacy
at
Rouen
,
I
boarded
in
a
boarding
house
;
I
dined
with
the
*NL*
professors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
he
went
on
,
expounding
his
opinions
generally
and
his
personal
*NL*
likings
,
until
Justin
came
to
fetch
him
for
a
mulled
egg
that
was
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
moment
's
peace
!
''
he
cried
;
``
always
at
it
!
I
ca
n't
go
out
for
a
*NL*
minute
!
Like
a
plough-horse
,
I
have
always
to
be
moiling
and
toiling
.
*NL*
What
drudgery
!
''
Then
,
when
he
was
at
the
door
,
``
By
the
way
,
do
you
know
*NL*
the
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
is
very
likely
,
''
Homais
went
on
,
raising
his
eyebrows
and
*NL*
assuming
one
of
his
most
serious
expression
,
``
that
the
agricultural
*NL*
meeting
of
the
Seine-Inferieure
will
be
held
this
year
at
*NL*
Yonville-l'Abbaye
.
The
rumour
,
at
all
events
,
is
going
the
round
.
This
*NL*
morning
the
paper
alluded
to
it
.
It
would
be
of
the
utmost
importance
*NL*
for
our
district
.
But
we
'll
talk
it
over
later
on
.
I
can
see

thank
you

Justin

*NL*
Chapter
Seven
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
a
dreary
one
for
Emma
.
Everything
seemed
to
her
*NL*
enveloped
in
a
black
atmosphere
floating
confusedly
over
the
exterior
of
*NL*
things
,
and
sorrow
was
engulfed
within
her
soul
with
soft
shrieks
such
*NL*
as
the
winter
wind
makes
in
ruined
castles
.
It
was
that
reverie
which
we
*NL*
give
to
things
that
will
not
return
,
the
lassitude
that
seizes
you
after
*NL*
everything
was
done
;
that
pain
,
in
fine
,
that
the
interruption
of
every
*NL*
wonted
movement
,
the
sudden
cessation
of
any
prolonged
vibration
,
brings
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
on
the
return
from
Vaubyessard
,
when
the
quadrilles
were
running
in
*NL*
her
head
,
she
was
full
of
a
gloomy
melancholy
,
of
a
numb
despair
.
*NL*
Leon
reappeared
,
taller
,
handsomer
,
more
charming
,
more
vague
.
Though
*NL*
separated
from
her
,
he
had
not
left
her
;
he
was
there
,
and
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
house
seemed
to
hold
his
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
detach
her
eyes
from
the
carpet
where
he
had
walked
,
from
*NL*
those
empty
chairs
where
he
had
sat
.
The
river
still
flowed
on
,
and
*NL*
slowly
drove
its
ripples
along
the
slippery
banks
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
often
walked
there
to
the
murmur
of
the
waves
over
the
*NL*
moss-covered
pebbles
.
How
bright
the
sun
had
been
!
What
happy
afternoons
*NL*
they
had
seen
alone
in
the
shade
at
the
end
of
the
garden
!
He
read
*NL*
aloud
,
bareheaded
,
sitting
on
a
footstool
of
dry
sticks
;
the
fresh
wind
*NL*
of
the
meadow
set
trembling
the
leaves
of
the
book
and
the
nasturtiums
*NL*
of
the
arbour
.
Ah
!
he
was
gone
,
the
only
charm
of
her
life
,
the
only
*NL*
possible
hope
of
joy
.
Why
had
she
not
seized
this
happiness
when
it
came
*NL*
to
her
?
Why
not
have
kept
hold
of
it
with
both
hands
,
with
both
knees
,
*NL*
when
it
was
about
to
flee
from
her
?
And
she
cursed
herself
for
not
*NL*
having
loved
Leon
.
She
thirsted
for
his
lips
.
The
wish
took
possession
*NL*
of
her
to
run
after
and
rejoin
him
,
throw
herself
into
his
arms
and
*NL*
say
to
him
,
``
It
is
I
;
I
am
yours
.
''
But
Emma
recoiled
beforehand
at
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
the
enterprise
,
and
her
desires
,
increased
by
regret
,
*NL*
became
only
the
more
acute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
the
memory
of
Leon
was
the
centre
of
her
boredom
;
it
burnt
*NL*
there
more
brightly
than
the
fire
travellers
have
left
on
the
snow
of
*NL*
a
Russian
steppe
.
She
sprang
towards
him
,
she
pressed
against
him
,
she
*NL*
stirred
carefully
the
dying
embers
,
sought
all
around
her
anything
*NL*
that
could
revive
it
;
and
the
most
distant
reminiscences
,
like
the
most
*NL*
immediate
occasions
,
what
she
experienced
as
well
as
what
she
imagined
,
*NL*
her
voluptuous
desires
that
were
unsatisfied
,
her
projects
of
happiness
*NL*
that
crackled
in
the
wind
like
dead
boughs
,
her
sterile
virtue
,
her
*NL*
lost
hopes
,
the
domestic
tete-a-tete
--
she
gathered
it
all
up
,
took
*NL*
everything
,
and
made
it
all
serve
as
fuel
for
her
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flames
,
however
,
subsided
,
either
because
the
supply
had
exhausted
*NL*
itself
,
or
because
it
had
been
piled
up
too
much
.
Love
,
little
by
*NL*
little
,
was
quelled
by
absence
;
regret
stifled
beneath
habit
;
and
this
*NL*
incendiary
light
that
had
empurpled
her
pale
sky
was
overspread
and
*NL*
faded
by
degrees
.
In
the
supineness
of
her
conscience
she
even
took
her
*NL*
repugnance
towards
her
husband
for
aspirations
towards
her
lover
,
the
*NL*
burning
of
hate
for
the
warmth
of
tenderness
;
but
as
the
tempest
still
*NL*
raged
,
and
as
passion
burnt
itself
down
to
the
very
cinders
,
and
no
help
*NL*
came
,
no
sun
rose
,
there
was
night
on
all
sides
,
and
she
was
lost
in
the
*NL*
terrible
cold
that
pierced
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
evil
days
of
Tostes
began
again
.
She
thought
herself
now
far
*NL*
more
unhappy
;
for
she
had
the
experience
of
grief
,
with
the
certainty
*NL*
that
it
would
not
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
who
had
laid
on
herself
such
sacrifices
could
well
allow
herself
*NL*
certain
whims
.
She
bought
a
Gothic
prie-dieu
,
and
in
a
month
spent
*NL*
fourteen
francs
on
lemons
for
polishing
her
nails
;
she
wrote
to
Rouen
*NL*
for
a
blue
cashmere
gown
;
she
chose
one
of
Lheureux
's
finest
scarves
,
*NL*
and
wore
it
knotted
around
her
waist
over
her
dressing-gown
;
and
,
with
*NL*
closed
blinds
and
a
book
in
her
hand
,
she
lay
stretched
out
on
a
couch
*NL*
in
this
garb
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
changed
her
coiffure
;
she
did
her
hair
a
la
Chinoise
,
in
*NL*
flowing
curls
,
in
plaited
coils
;
she
parted
in
on
one
side
and
rolled
it
*NL*
under
like
a
man
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
learn
Italian
;
she
bought
dictionaries
,
a
grammar
,
and
*NL*
a
supply
of
white
paper
.
She
tried
serious
reading
,
history
,
and
*NL*
philosophy
.
Sometimes
in
the
night
Charles
woke
up
with
a
start
,
*NL*
thinking
he
was
being
called
to
a
patient
.
``
I
'm
coming
,
''
he
stammered
;
*NL*
and
it
was
the
noise
of
a
match
Emma
had
struck
to
relight
the
lamp
.
But
*NL*
her
reading
fared
like
her
piece
of
embroidery
,
all
of
which
,
only
just
*NL*
begun
,
filled
her
cupboard
;
she
took
it
up
,
left
it
,
passed
on
to
other
*NL*
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
attacks
in
which
she
could
easily
have
been
driven
to
commit
any
*NL*
folly
.
She
maintained
one
day
,
in
opposition
to
her
husband
,
that
she
*NL*
could
drink
off
a
large
glass
of
brandy
,
and
,
as
Charles
was
stupid
*NL*
enough
to
dare
her
to
,
she
swallowed
the
brandy
to
the
last
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
vapourish
airs
-LRB-
as
the
housewives
of
Yonville
called
*NL*
them
-RRB-
,
Emma
,
all
the
same
,
never
seemed
gay
,
and
usually
she
had
at
the
*NL*
corners
of
her
mouth
that
immobile
contraction
that
puckers
the
faces
of
*NL*
old
maids
,
and
those
of
men
whose
ambition
has
failed
.
She
was
pale
all
*NL*
over
,
white
as
a
sheet
;
the
skin
of
her
nose
was
drawn
at
the
nostrils
,
*NL*
her
eyes
looked
at
you
vaguely
.
After
discovering
three
grey
hairs
on
*NL*
her
temples
,
she
talked
much
of
her
old
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
fainted
.
One
day
she
even
spat
blood
,
and
,
as
Charles
fussed
*NL*
around
her
showing
his
anxiety
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
she
answered
,
``
what
does
it
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
fled
to
his
study
and
wept
there
,
both
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
*NL*
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
at
his
bureau
under
the
phrenological
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
wrote
to
his
mother
begging
her
to
come
,
and
they
had
many
long
*NL*
consultations
together
on
the
subject
of
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
should
they
decide
?
What
was
to
be
done
since
she
rejected
all
*NL*
medical
treatment
?
``
Do
you
know
what
your
wife
wants
?
''
replied
Madame
*NL*
Bovary
senior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wants
to
be
forced
to
occupy
herself
with
some
manual
work
.
If
she
*NL*
were
obliged
,
like
so
many
others
,
to
earn
her
living
,
she
would
n't
have
*NL*
these
vapours
,
that
come
to
her
from
a
lot
of
ideas
she
stuffs
into
her
*NL*
head
,
and
from
the
idleness
in
which
she
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
she
is
always
busy
,
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
always
busy
at
what
?
Reading
novels
,
bad
books
,
works
against
*NL*
religion
,
and
in
which
they
mock
at
priests
in
speeches
taken
from
*NL*
Voltaire
.
But
all
that
leads
you
far
astray
,
my
poor
child
.
Anyone
who
*NL*
has
no
religion
always
ends
by
turning
out
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
decided
to
stop
Emma
reading
novels
.
The
enterprise
did
not
*NL*
seem
easy
.
The
good
lady
undertook
it
.
She
was
,
when
she
passed
through
*NL*
Rouen
,
to
go
herself
to
the
lending-library
and
represent
that
Emma
had
*NL*
discontinued
her
subscription
.
Would
they
not
have
a
right
to
apply
*NL*
to
the
police
if
the
librarian
persisted
all
the
same
in
his
poisonous
*NL*
trade
?
The
farewells
of
mother
and
daughter-in-law
were
cold
.
During
*NL*
the
three
weeks
that
they
had
been
together
they
had
not
exchanged
*NL*
half-a-dozen
words
apart
from
the
inquiries
and
phrases
when
they
met
at
*NL*
table
and
in
the
evening
before
going
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
left
on
a
Wednesday
,
the
market-day
at
Yonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Place
since
morning
had
been
blocked
by
a
row
of
carts
,
which
,
on
*NL*
end
and
their
shafts
in
the
air
,
spread
all
along
the
line
of
houses
*NL*
from
the
church
to
the
inn
.
On
the
other
side
there
were
canvas
booths
,
*NL*
where
cotton
checks
,
blankets
,
and
woollen
stockings
were
sold
,
*NL*
together
with
harness
for
horses
,
and
packets
of
blue
ribbon
,
whose
ends
*NL*
fluttered
in
the
wind
.
The
coarse
hardware
was
spread
out
on
the
ground
*NL*
between
pyramids
of
eggs
and
hampers
of
cheeses
,
from
which
sticky
straw
*NL*
stuck
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
corn-machines
clucking
hens
passed
their
necks
through
the
bars
*NL*
of
flat
cages
.
The
people
,
crowding
in
the
same
place
and
unwilling
*NL*
to
move
thence
,
sometimes
threatened
to
smash
the
shop
front
of
the
*NL*
chemist
.
On
Wednesdays
his
shop
was
never
empty
,
and
the
people
pushed
*NL*
in
less
to
buy
drugs
than
for
consultations
.
So
great
was
Homais
'
*NL*
reputation
in
the
neighbouring
villages
.
His
robust
aplomb
had
*NL*
fascinated
the
rustics
.
They
considered
him
a
greater
doctor
than
all
*NL*
the
doctors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
leaning
out
at
the
window
;
she
was
often
there
.
The
window
in
*NL*
the
provinces
replaces
the
theatre
and
the
promenade
,
she
was
amusing
*NL*
herself
with
watching
the
crowd
of
boors
when
she
saw
a
gentleman
in
*NL*
a
green
velvet
coat
.
He
had
on
yellow
gloves
,
although
he
wore
heavy
*NL*
gaiters
;
he
was
coming
towards
the
doctor
's
house
,
followed
by
a
peasant
*NL*
walking
with
a
bent
head
and
quite
a
thoughtful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
see
the
doctor
?
''
he
asked
Justin
,
who
was
talking
on
the
*NL*
doorsteps
with
Felicite
,
and
,
taking
him
for
a
servant
of
the
*NL*
house
--
``
Tell
him
that
Monsieur
Rodolphe
Boulanger
of
La
Huchette
is
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
from
territorial
vanity
that
the
new
arrival
added
``
of
La
*NL*
Huchette
''
to
his
name
,
but
to
make
himself
the
better
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Huchette
,
in
fact
,
was
an
estate
near
Yonville
,
where
he
had
just
*NL*
bought
the
chateau
and
two
farms
that
he
cultivated
himself
,
without
,
*NL*
however
,
troubling
very
much
about
them
.
He
lived
as
a
bachelor
,
and
was
*NL*
supposed
to
have
``
at
least
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
came
into
the
room
.
Monsieur
Boulanger
introduced
his
man
,
who
*NL*
wanted
to
be
bled
because
he
felt
``
a
tingling
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
purge
me
,
''
he
urged
as
an
objection
to
all
reasoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Bovary
ordered
a
bandage
and
a
basin
,
and
asked
Justin
to
hold
it
.
*NL*
Then
addressing
the
peasant
,
who
was
already
pale
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
my
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
sir
,
''
said
the
other
;
``
get
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
an
air
of
bravado
he
held
out
his
great
arm
.
At
the
prick
of
*NL*
the
lancet
the
blood
spurted
out
,
splashing
against
the
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
the
basin
nearer
,
''
exclaimed
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lor
!
''
said
the
peasant
,
``
one
would
swear
it
was
a
little
fountain
*NL*
flowing
.
How
red
my
blood
is
!
That
's
a
good
sign
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
''
answered
the
doctor
,
``
one
feels
nothing
at
first
,
and
then
*NL*
syncope
sets
in
,
and
more
especially
with
people
of
strong
constitution
*NL*
like
this
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
the
rustic
let
go
the
lancet-case
he
was
twisting
between
*NL*
his
fingers
.
A
shudder
of
his
shoulders
made
the
chair-back
creak
.
His
*NL*
hat
fell
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
as
much
,
''
said
Bovary
,
pressing
his
finger
on
the
vein
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
basin
was
beginning
to
tremble
in
Justin
's
hands
;
his
knees
shook
,
*NL*
he
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
!
Emma
!
''
called
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
one
bound
she
came
down
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
vinegar
,
''
he
cried
.
``
O
dear
!
two
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
his
emotion
he
could
hardly
put
on
the
compress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
,
''
said
Monsieur
Boulanger
quietly
,
taking
Justin
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
He
seated
him
on
the
table
with
his
back
resting
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
began
taking
off
his
cravat
.
The
strings
of
his
shirt
had
*NL*
got
into
a
knot
,
and
she
was
for
some
minutes
moving
her
light
fingers
*NL*
about
the
young
fellow
's
neck
.
Then
she
poured
some
vinegar
on
her
*NL*
cambric
handkerchief
;
she
moistened
his
temples
with
little
dabs
,
and
*NL*
then
blew
upon
them
softly
.
The
ploughman
revived
,
but
Justin
's
syncope
*NL*
still
lasted
,
and
his
eyeballs
disappeared
in
the
pale
sclerotics
like
*NL*
blue
flowers
in
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
hide
this
from
him
,
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
took
the
basin
to
put
it
under
the
table
.
With
the
*NL*
movement
she
made
in
bending
down
,
her
dress
-LRB-
it
was
a
summer
dress
with
*NL*
four
flounces
,
yellow
,
long
in
the
waist
and
wide
in
the
skirt
-RRB-
spread
*NL*
out
around
her
on
the
flags
of
the
room
;
and
as
Emma
stooping
,
staggered
*NL*
a
little
as
she
stretched
out
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stuff
here
and
there
gave
with
the
inflections
of
her
bust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
went
to
fetch
a
bottle
of
water
,
and
she
was
melting
some
*NL*
pieces
of
sugar
when
the
chemist
arrived
.
The
servant
had
been
to
*NL*
fetch
him
in
the
tumult
.
Seeing
his
pupil
's
eyes
staring
he
drew
a
long
*NL*
breath
;
then
going
around
him
he
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
!
''
he
said
,
``
really
a
little
fool
!
A
fool
in
four
letters
!
A
*NL*
phlebotomy
's
a
big
affair
,
is
n't
it
!
And
a
fellow
who
is
n't
afraid
of
*NL*
anything
;
a
kind
of
squirrel
,
just
as
he
is
who
climbs
to
vertiginous
*NL*
heights
to
shake
down
nuts
.
Oh
,
yes
!
you
just
talk
to
me
,
boast
about
*NL*
yourself
!
Here
's
a
fine
fitness
for
practising
pharmacy
later
on
;
for
*NL*
under
serious
circumstances
you
may
be
called
before
the
tribunals
in
*NL*
order
to
enlighten
the
minds
of
the
magistrates
,
and
you
would
have
to
*NL*
keep
your
head
then
,
to
reason
,
show
yourself
a
man
,
or
else
pass
for
an
*NL*
imbecile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Justin
did
not
answer
.
The
chemist
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
asked
you
to
come
?
You
are
always
pestering
the
doctor
and
madame
.
*NL*
On
Wednesday
,
moreover
,
your
presence
is
indispensable
to
me
.
There
are
*NL*
now
twenty
people
in
the
shop
.
I
left
everything
because
of
the
interest
*NL*
I
take
in
you
.
Come
,
get
along
!
Sharp
!
Wait
for
me
,
and
keep
an
eye
on
*NL*
the
jars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Justin
,
who
was
rearranging
his
dress
,
had
gone
,
they
talked
for
a
*NL*
little
while
about
fainting-fits
.
Madame
Bovary
had
never
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
extraordinary
for
a
lady
,
''
said
Monsieur
Boulanger
;
``
but
some
*NL*
people
are
very
susceptible
.
Thus
in
a
duel
,
I
have
seen
a
second
lose
*NL*
consciousness
at
the
mere
sound
of
the
loading
of
pistols
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
``
the
sight
of
other
people
's
blood
*NL*
does
n't
affect
me
at
all
,
but
the
mere
thought
of
my
own
flowing
would
*NL*
make
me
faint
if
I
reflected
upon
it
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Boulanger
,
however
,
dismissed
his
servant
,
advising
him
to
calm
*NL*
himself
,
since
his
fancy
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
procured
me
the
advantage
of
making
your
acquaintance
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
and
he
looked
at
Emma
as
he
said
this
.
Then
he
put
three
francs
on
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
table
,
bowed
negligently
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
soon
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
-LRB-
this
was
his
way
back
to
La
*NL*
Huchette
-RRB-
,
and
Emma
saw
him
in
the
meadow
,
walking
under
the
poplars
,
*NL*
slackening
his
pace
now
and
then
as
one
who
reflects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
pretty
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
she
is
very
pretty
,
this
*NL*
doctor
's
wife
.
Fine
teeth
,
black
eyes
,
a
dainty
foot
,
a
figure
like
a
*NL*
Parisienne
's
.
Where
the
devil
does
she
come
from
?
Wherever
did
that
fat
*NL*
fellow
pick
her
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Rodolphe
Boulanger
was
thirty-four
;
he
was
of
brutal
*NL*
temperament
and
intelligent
perspicacity
,
having
,
moreover
,
had
much
to
*NL*
do
with
women
,
and
knowing
them
well
.
This
one
had
seemed
pretty
to
him
;
*NL*
so
he
was
thinking
about
her
and
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
is
very
stupid
.
She
is
tired
of
him
,
no
doubt
.
He
has
dirty
*NL*
nails
,
and
has
n't
shaved
for
three
days
.
While
he
is
trotting
after
his
*NL*
patients
,
she
sits
there
botching
socks
.
And
she
gets
bored
!
She
would
*NL*
like
to
live
in
town
and
dance
polkas
every
evening
.
Poor
little
woman
!
*NL*
She
is
gaping
after
love
like
a
carp
after
water
on
a
kitchen-table
.
*NL*
With
three
words
of
gallantry
she
'd
adore
one
,
I
'm
sure
of
it
.
She
'd
be
*NL*
tender
,
charming
.
Yes
;
but
how
to
get
rid
of
her
afterwards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
difficulties
of
love-making
seen
in
the
distance
made
him
by
*NL*
contrast
think
of
his
mistress
.
She
was
an
actress
at
Rouen
,
whom
he
*NL*
kept
;
and
when
he
had
pondered
over
this
image
,
with
which
,
even
in
*NL*
remembrance
,
he
was
satiated
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Madame
Bovary
,
''
he
thought
,
``
is
much
prettier
,
especially
fresher
.
*NL*
Virginie
is
decidedly
beginning
to
grow
fat
.
She
is
so
finiky
about
her
*NL*
pleasures
;
and
,
besides
,
she
has
a
mania
for
prawns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fields
were
empty
,
and
around
him
Rodolphe
only
heard
the
regular
*NL*
beating
of
the
grass
striking
against
his
boots
,
with
a
cry
of
the
*NL*
grasshopper
hidden
at
a
distance
among
the
oats
.
He
again
saw
Emma
in
*NL*
her
room
,
dressed
as
he
had
seen
her
,
and
he
undressed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
have
her
,
''
he
cried
,
striking
a
blow
with
his
stick
at
a
*NL*
clod
in
front
of
him
.
And
he
at
once
began
to
consider
the
political
*NL*
part
of
the
enterprise
.
He
asked
himself
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
we
meet
?
By
what
means
?
We
shall
always
be
having
the
brat
*NL*
on
our
hands
,
and
the
servant
,
the
neighbours
,
and
husband
,
all
sorts
of
*NL*
worries
.
Pshaw
!
one
would
lose
too
much
time
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
resumed
,
``
She
really
has
eyes
that
pierce
one
's
heart
like
a
*NL*
gimlet
.
And
that
pale
complexion
!
I
adore
pale
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
top
of
the
Arguiel
hills
he
had
made
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
``
It
's
only
finding
the
opportunities
.
Well
,
I
will
call
in
now
and
then
.
*NL*
I
'll
send
them
venison
,
poultry
;
I
'll
have
myself
bled
,
if
need
be
.
We
*NL*
shall
become
friends
;
I
'll
invite
them
to
my
place
.
By
Jove
!
''
added
he
,
*NL*
``
there
's
the
agricultural
show
coming
on
.
She
'll
be
there
.
I
shall
see
*NL*
her

We
'll
begin
boldly
,
for
that
's
the
surest
way

*NL*
Chapter
Eight
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
it
came
,
the
famous
agricultural
show
.
On
the
morning
of
the
*NL*
solemnity
all
the
inhabitants
at
their
doors
were
chatting
over
the
*NL*
preparations
.
The
pediment
of
the
town
hall
had
been
hung
with
garlands
*NL*
of
ivy
;
a
tent
had
been
erected
in
a
meadow
for
the
banquet
;
and
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
Place
,
in
front
of
the
church
,
a
kind
of
bombarde
was
*NL*
to
announce
the
arrival
of
the
prefect
and
the
names
of
the
successful
*NL*
farmers
who
had
obtained
prizes
.
The
National
Guard
of
Buchy
-LRB-
there
was
*NL*
none
at
Yonville
-RRB-
had
come
to
join
the
corps
of
firemen
,
of
whom
Binet
*NL*
was
captain
.
On
that
day
he
wore
a
collar
even
higher
than
usual
;
and
,
*NL*
tightly
buttoned
in
his
tunic
,
his
figure
was
so
stiff
and
motionless
*NL*
that
the
whole
vital
portion
of
his
person
seemed
to
have
descended
into
*NL*
his
legs
,
which
rose
in
a
cadence
of
set
steps
with
a
single
movement
.
*NL*
As
there
was
some
rivalry
between
the
tax-collector
and
the
colonel
,
*NL*
both
,
to
show
off
their
talents
,
drilled
their
men
separately
.
One
*NL*
saw
the
red
epaulettes
and
the
black
breastplates
pass
and
re-pass
*NL*
alternately
;
there
was
no
end
to
it
,
and
it
constantly
began
again
.
*NL*
There
had
never
been
such
a
display
of
pomp
.
Several
citizens
had
*NL*
scoured
their
houses
the
evening
before
;
tri-coloured
flags
hung
from
*NL*
half-open
windows
;
all
the
public-houses
were
full
;
and
in
the
lovely
*NL*
weather
the
starched
caps
,
the
golden
crosses
,
and
the
coloured
*NL*
neckerchiefs
seemed
whiter
than
snow
,
shone
in
the
sun
,
and
relieved
*NL*
with
the
motley
colours
the
sombre
monotony
of
the
frock-coats
and
blue
*NL*
smocks
.
The
neighbouring
farmers
'
wives
,
when
they
got
off
their
horses
,
*NL*
pulled
out
the
long
pins
that
fastened
around
them
their
dresses
,
turned
*NL*
up
for
fear
of
mud
;
and
the
husbands
,
for
their
part
,
in
order
to
save
*NL*
their
hats
,
kept
their
handkerchiefs
around
them
,
holding
one
corner
*NL*
between
their
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
came
into
the
main
street
from
both
ends
of
the
village
.
*NL*
People
poured
in
from
the
lanes
,
the
alleys
,
the
houses
;
and
from
time
*NL*
to
time
one
heard
knockers
banging
against
doors
closing
behind
women
*NL*
with
their
gloves
,
who
were
going
out
to
see
the
fete
.
What
was
most
*NL*
admired
were
two
long
lamp-stands
covered
with
lanterns
,
that
flanked
a
*NL*
platform
on
which
the
authorities
were
to
sit
.
Besides
this
there
were
*NL*
against
the
four
columns
of
the
town
hall
four
kinds
of
poles
,
*NL*
each
bearing
a
small
standard
of
greenish
cloth
,
embellished
with
*NL*
inscriptions
in
gold
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
was
written
,
``
To
Commerce
''
;
on
the
other
,
``
To
Agriculture
''
;
on
*NL*
the
third
,
``
To
Industry
''
;
and
on
the
fourth
,
``
To
the
Fine
Arts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
jubilation
that
brightened
all
faces
seemed
to
darken
that
of
*NL*
Madame
Lefrancois
,
the
innkeeper
.
Standing
on
her
kitchen-steps
she
*NL*
muttered
to
herself
,
``
What
rubbish
!
what
rubbish
!
With
their
canvas
*NL*
booth
!
Do
they
think
the
prefect
will
be
glad
to
dine
down
there
under
*NL*
a
tent
like
a
gipsy
?
They
call
all
this
fussing
doing
good
to
the
place
!
*NL*
Then
it
was
n't
worth
while
sending
to
Neufchatel
for
the
keeper
of
a
*NL*
cookshop
!
And
for
whom
?
For
cowherds
!
tatterdemalions
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
was
passing
.
He
had
on
a
frock-coat
,
nankeen
trousers
,
*NL*
beaver
shoes
,
and
,
for
a
wonder
,
a
hat
with
a
low
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
servant
!
Excuse
me
,
I
am
in
a
hurry
.
''
And
as
the
fat
widow
asked
*NL*
where
he
was
going
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
odd
to
you
,
does
n't
it
,
I
who
am
always
more
cooped
up
in
my
*NL*
laboratory
than
the
man
's
rat
in
his
cheese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
cheese
?
''
asked
the
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
!
nothing
!
''
Homais
continued
.
``
I
merely
wished
to
convey
*NL*
to
you
,
Madame
Lefrancois
,
that
I
usually
live
at
home
like
a
recluse
.
*NL*
To-day
,
however
,
considering
the
circumstances
,
it
is
necessary
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
going
down
there
!
''
she
said
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
going
,
''
replied
the
druggist
,
astonished
.
``
Am
I
not
a
member
*NL*
of
the
consulting
commission
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mere
Lefrancois
looked
at
him
for
a
few
moments
,
and
ended
by
saying
*NL*
with
a
smile
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
another
pair
of
shoes
!
But
what
does
agriculture
matter
to
you
?
*NL*
Do
you
understand
anything
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
understand
it
,
since
I
am
a
druggist
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
a
chemist
.
And
the
object
of
chemistry
,
Madame
Lefrancois
,
being
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
reciprocal
and
molecular
action
of
all
natural
bodies
,
*NL*
it
follows
that
agriculture
is
comprised
within
its
domain
.
And
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
the
composition
of
the
manure
,
the
fermentation
of
liquids
,
the
*NL*
analyses
of
gases
,
and
the
influence
of
miasmata
,
what
,
I
ask
you
,
is
*NL*
all
this
,
if
it
is
n't
chemistry
,
pure
and
simple

The
landlady
did
not
answer
.
Homais
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
that
to
be
an
agriculturist
it
is
necessary
to
have
tilled
*NL*
the
earth
or
fattened
fowls
oneself
?
It
is
necessary
rather
to
know
the
*NL*
composition
of
the
substances
in
question
--
the
geological
strata
,
the
*NL*
atmospheric
actions
,
the
quality
of
the
soil
,
the
minerals
,
the
waters
,
*NL*
the
density
of
the
different
bodies
,
their
capillarity
,
and
what
not
.
*NL*
And
one
must
be
master
of
all
the
principles
of
hygiene
in
order
to
*NL*
direct
,
criticize
the
construction
of
buildings
,
the
feeding
of
animals
,
*NL*
the
diet
of
domestics
.
And
,
moreover
,
Madame
Lefrancois
,
one
must
know
*NL*
botany
,
be
able
to
distinguish
between
plants
,
you
understand
,
which
are
*NL*
the
wholesome
and
those
that
are
deleterious
,
which
are
unproductive
*NL*
and
which
nutritive
,
if
it
is
well
to
pull
them
up
here
and
re-sow
them
*NL*
there
,
to
propagate
some
,
destroy
others
;
in
brief
,
one
must
keep
pace
*NL*
with
science
by
means
of
pamphlets
and
public
papers
,
be
always
on
the
*NL*
alert
to
find
out
improvements
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
never
took
her
eyes
off
the
``
Cafe
Francois
''
and
the
chemist
*NL*
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
to
God
our
agriculturists
were
chemists
,
or
that
at
least
they
*NL*
would
pay
more
attention
to
the
counsels
of
science
.
Thus
lately
I
*NL*
myself
wrote
a
considerable
tract
,
a
memoir
of
over
seventy-two
pages
,
*NL*
entitled
,
`
Cider
,
its
Manufacture
and
its
Effects
,
together
with
some
*NL*
New
Reflections
on
the
Subject
,
'
that
I
sent
to
the
Agricultural
Society
*NL*
of
Rouen
,
and
which
even
procured
me
the
honour
of
being
received
among
*NL*
its
members
--
Section
,
Agriculture
;
Class
,
Pomological
.
Well
,
if
my
*NL*
work
had
been
given
to
the
public
--
''
But
the
druggist
stopped
,
Madame
*NL*
Lefrancois
seemed
so
preoccupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
at
them
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
past
comprehension
!
Such
a
cookshop
*NL*
as
that
!
''
And
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
stretched
out
over
her
*NL*
breast
the
stitches
of
her
knitted
bodice
,
she
pointed
with
both
hands
*NL*
at
her
rival
's
inn
,
whence
songs
were
heard
issuing
.
``
Well
,
it
wo
n't
*NL*
last
long
,
''
she
added
.
``
It
'll
be
over
before
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
drew
back
with
stupefaction
.
She
came
down
three
steps
and
*NL*
whispered
in
his
ear
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
did
n't
know
it
?
There
is
to
be
an
execution
in
next
week
.
*NL*
It
's
Lheureux
who
is
selling
him
out
;
he
has
killed
him
with
bills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
terrible
catastrophe
!
''
cried
the
druggist
,
who
always
found
*NL*
expressions
in
harmony
with
all
imaginable
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
landlady
began
telling
him
the
story
that
she
had
heard
from
*NL*
Theodore
,
Monsieur
Guillaumin
's
servant
,
and
although
she
detested
*NL*
Tellier
,
she
blamed
Lheureux
.
He
was
``
a
wheedler
,
a
sneak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
she
said
.
``
Look
at
him
!
he
is
in
the
market
;
he
is
bowing
to
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
,
who
's
got
on
a
green
bonnet
.
Why
,
she
's
taking
Monsieur
*NL*
Boulanger
's
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Bovary
!
''
exclaimed
Homais
.
``
I
must
go
at
once
and
pay
her
my
*NL*
respects
.
Perhaps
she
'll
be
very
glad
to
have
a
seat
in
the
enclosure
*NL*
under
the
peristyle
.
''
And
,
without
heeding
Madame
Lefrancois
,
who
was
*NL*
calling
him
back
to
tell
him
more
about
it
,
the
druggist
walked
off
*NL*
rapidly
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
,
with
straight
knees
,
bowing
copiously
*NL*
to
right
and
left
,
and
taking
up
much
room
with
the
large
tails
of
his
*NL*
frock-coat
that
fluttered
behind
him
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
having
caught
sight
of
him
from
afar
,
hurried
on
,
but
Madame
*NL*
Bovary
lost
her
breath
;
so
he
walked
more
slowly
,
and
,
smiling
at
her
,
*NL*
said
in
a
rough
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
to
get
away
from
that
fat
fellow
,
you
know
,
the
druggist
.
''
*NL*
She
pressed
his
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
meaning
of
that
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
And
he
looked
at
her
out
*NL*
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
profile
was
so
calm
that
one
could
guess
nothing
from
it
.
It
stood
*NL*
out
in
the
light
from
the
oval
of
her
bonnet
,
with
pale
ribbons
on
it
*NL*
like
the
leaves
of
weeds
.
Her
eyes
with
their
long
curved
lashes
looked
*NL*
straight
before
her
,
and
though
wide
open
,
they
seemed
slightly
puckered
*NL*
by
the
cheek-bones
,
because
of
the
blood
pulsing
gently
under
the
*NL*
delicate
skin
.
A
pink
line
ran
along
the
partition
between
her
nostrils
.
*NL*
Her
head
was
bent
upon
her
shoulder
,
and
the
pearl
tips
of
her
white
*NL*
teeth
were
seen
between
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
making
fun
of
me
?
''
thought
Rodolphe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
's
gesture
,
however
,
had
only
been
meant
for
a
warning
;
for
Monsieur
*NL*
Lheureux
was
accompanying
them
,
and
spoke
now
and
again
as
if
to
enter
*NL*
into
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
superb
day
!
Everybody
is
out
!
The
wind
is
east
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
neither
Madame
Bovary
nor
Rodolphe
answered
him
,
whilst
at
the
*NL*
slightest
movement
made
by
them
he
drew
near
,
saying
,
``
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
!
''
and
raised
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
farrier
's
house
,
instead
of
following
the
road
*NL*
up
to
the
fence
,
Rodolphe
suddenly
turned
down
a
path
,
drawing
with
him
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
.
He
called
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
!
See
you
again
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
got
rid
of
him
!
''
she
said
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
allow
oneself
to
be
intruded
upon
by
others
?
And
as
*NL*
to-day
I
have
the
happiness
of
being
with
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
blushed
.
He
did
not
finish
his
sentence
.
Then
he
talked
of
the
fine
*NL*
weather
and
of
the
pleasure
of
walking
on
the
grass
.
A
few
daisies
had
*NL*
sprung
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
some
pretty
Easter
daisies
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
enough
of
them
to
*NL*
furnish
oracles
to
all
the
amorous
maids
in
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
,
``
Shall
I
pick
some
?
What
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
love
?
''
she
asked
,
coughing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
,
h
'm
!
who
knows
?
''
answered
Rodolphe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meadow
began
to
fill
,
and
the
housewives
hustled
you
with
their
*NL*
great
umbrellas
,
their
baskets
,
and
their
babies
.
One
had
often
to
get
*NL*
out
of
the
way
of
a
long
file
of
country
folk
,
servant-maids
with
blue
*NL*
stockings
,
flat
shoes
,
silver
rings
,
and
who
smelt
of
milk
,
when
one
*NL*
passed
close
to
them
.
They
walked
along
holding
one
another
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
thus
they
spread
over
the
whole
field
from
the
row
of
open
trees
to
*NL*
the
banquet
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
the
examination
time
,
and
the
farmers
one
after
the
other
*NL*
entered
a
kind
of
enclosure
formed
by
a
long
cord
supported
on
sticks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beasts
were
there
,
their
noses
towards
the
cord
,
and
making
a
*NL*
confused
line
with
their
unequal
rumps
.
Drowsy
pigs
were
burrowing
in
*NL*
the
earth
with
their
snouts
,
calves
were
bleating
,
lambs
baaing
;
the
*NL*
cows
,
on
knees
folded
in
,
were
stretching
their
bellies
on
the
grass
,
*NL*
slowly
chewing
the
cud
,
and
blinking
their
heavy
eyelids
at
the
gnats
*NL*
that
buzzed
round
them
.
Plough-men
with
bare
arms
were
holding
by
the
*NL*
halter
prancing
stallions
that
neighed
with
dilated
nostrils
looking
*NL*
towards
the
mares
.
These
stood
quietly
,
stretching
out
their
heads
and
*NL*
flowing
manes
,
while
their
foals
rested
in
their
shadow
,
or
now
and
then
*NL*
came
and
sucked
them
.
And
above
the
long
undulation
of
these
crowded
*NL*
animals
one
saw
some
white
mane
rising
in
the
wind
like
a
wave
,
or
some
*NL*
sharp
horns
sticking
out
,
and
the
heads
of
men
running
about
.
Apart
,
*NL*
outside
the
enclosure
,
a
hundred
paces
off
,
was
a
large
black
bull
,
*NL*
muzzled
,
with
an
iron
ring
in
its
nostrils
,
and
who
moved
no
more
than
*NL*
if
he
had
been
in
bronze
.
A
child
in
rags
was
holding
him
by
a
rope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
the
two
lines
the
committee-men
were
walking
with
heavy
steps
,
*NL*
examining
each
animal
,
then
consulting
one
another
in
a
low
voice
.
One
*NL*
who
seemed
of
more
importance
now
and
then
took
notes
in
a
book
as
he
*NL*
walked
along
.
This
was
the
president
of
the
jury
,
Monsieur
Derozerays
de
*NL*
la
Panville
.
As
soon
as
he
recognised
Rodolphe
he
came
forward
quickly
,
*NL*
and
smiling
amiably
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Monsieur
Boulanger
,
you
are
deserting
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
protested
that
he
was
just
coming
.
But
when
the
president
had
*NL*
disappeared
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
!
*
''
said
he
,
``
I
shall
not
go
.
Your
company
is
better
than
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Upon
my
word
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
poking
fun
at
the
show
,
Rodolphe
,
to
move
about
more
easily
,
*NL*
showed
the
gendarme
his
blue
card
,
and
even
stopped
now
and
then
in
*NL*
front
of
some
fine
beast
,
which
Madame
Bovary
did
not
at
all
admire
.
*NL*
He
noticed
this
,
and
began
jeering
at
the
Yonville
ladies
and
their
*NL*
dresses
;
then
he
apologised
for
the
negligence
of
his
own
.
He
had
that
*NL*
incongruity
of
common
and
elegant
in
which
the
habitually
vulgar
think
*NL*
they
see
the
revelation
of
an
eccentric
existence
,
of
the
perturbations
*NL*
of
sentiment
,
the
tyrannies
of
art
,
and
always
a
certain
contempt
for
*NL*
social
conventions
,
that
seduces
or
exasperates
them
.
Thus
his
cambric
*NL*
shirt
with
plaited
cuffs
was
blown
out
by
the
wind
in
the
opening
of
his
*NL*
waistcoat
of
grey
ticking
,
and
his
broad-striped
trousers
disclosed
at
*NL*
the
ankle
nankeen
boots
with
patent
leather
gaiters
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
so
polished
that
they
reflected
the
grass
.
He
trampled
on
*NL*
horses
's
dung
with
them
,
one
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
his
*NL*
straw
hat
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
added
he
,
``
when
one
lives
in
the
country
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
waste
of
time
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
replied
Rodolphe
.
``
To
think
that
not
one
of
these
people
*NL*
is
capable
of
understanding
even
the
cut
of
a
coat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
talked
about
provincial
mediocrity
,
of
the
lives
it
crushed
,
*NL*
the
illusions
lost
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
too
,
''
said
Rodolphe
,
``
am
drifting
into
depression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
''
she
said
in
astonishment
;
``
I
thought
you
very
light-hearted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
.
I
seem
so
,
because
in
the
midst
of
the
world
I
know
how
to
*NL*
wear
the
mask
of
a
scoffer
upon
my
face
;
and
yet
,
how
many
a
time
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
a
cemetery
by
moonlight
have
I
not
asked
myself
whether
it
were
*NL*
not
better
to
join
those
sleeping
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
and
your
friends
?
''
she
said
.
``
You
do
not
think
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friends
!
What
friends
?
Have
I
any
?
Who
cares
for
me
?
''
And
he
*NL*
accompanied
the
last
words
with
a
kind
of
whistling
of
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
obliged
to
separate
from
each
other
because
of
a
great
*NL*
pile
of
chairs
that
a
man
was
carrying
behind
them
.
He
was
so
overladen
*NL*
with
them
that
one
could
only
see
the
tips
of
his
wooden
shoes
and
the
*NL*
ends
of
his
two
outstretched
arms
.
It
was
Lestiboudois
,
the
gravedigger
,
*NL*
who
was
carrying
the
church
chairs
about
amongst
the
people
.
Alive
to
*NL*
all
that
concerned
his
interests
,
he
had
hit
upon
this
means
of
turning
*NL*
the
show
to
account
;
and
his
idea
was
succeeding
,
for
he
no
longer
knew
*NL*
which
way
to
turn
.
In
fact
,
the
villagers
,
who
were
hot
,
quarreled
for
*NL*
these
seats
,
whose
straw
smelt
of
incense
,
and
they
leant
against
the
*NL*
thick
backs
,
stained
with
the
wax
of
candles
,
with
a
certain
veneration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
again
took
Rodolphe
's
arm
;
he
went
on
as
if
speaking
to
*NL*
himself
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
missed
so
many
things
.
Always
alone
!
Ah
!
if
I
had
some
aim
*NL*
in
life
,
if
I
had
met
some
love
,
if
I
had
found
someone
!
Oh
,
how
I
would
*NL*
have
spent
all
the
energy
of
which
I
am
capable
,
surmounted
everything
,
*NL*
overcome
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
it
seems
to
me
,
''
said
Emma
,
``
that
you
are
not
to
be
pitied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
think
so
?
''
said
Rodolphe

*NL*
``
For
,
after
all
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
you
are
free

''
she
hesitated
,
``
rich

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
mock
me
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
protested
that
she
was
not
mocking
him
,
when
the
report
of
a
*NL*
cannon
resounded
.
Immediately
all
began
hustling
one
another
pell-mell
*NL*
towards
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
false
alarm
.
The
prefect
seemed
not
to
be
coming
,
and
the
*NL*
members
of
the
jury
felt
much
embarrassed
,
not
knowing
if
they
ought
to
*NL*
begin
the
meeting
or
still
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
at
the
end
of
the
Place
a
large
hired
landau
appeared
,
drawn
by
*NL*
two
thin
horses
,
which
a
coachman
in
a
white
hat
was
whipping
lustily
.
*NL*
Binet
had
only
just
time
to
shout
,
``
Present
arms
!
''
and
the
colonel
to
*NL*
imitate
him
.
All
ran
towards
the
enclosure
;
everyone
pushed
forward
.
A
*NL*
few
even
forgot
their
collars
;
but
the
equipage
of
the
prefect
seemed
*NL*
to
anticipate
the
crowd
,
and
the
two
yoked
jades
,
trapesing
in
their
*NL*
harness
,
came
up
at
a
little
trot
in
front
of
the
peristyle
of
the
town
*NL*
hall
at
the
very
moment
when
the
National
Guard
and
firemen
deployed
,
*NL*
beating
drums
and
marking
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Present
!
''
shouted
Binet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halt
!
''
shouted
the
colonel
.
``
Left
about
,
march
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
presenting
arms
,
during
which
the
clang
of
the
band
,
letting
*NL*
loose
,
rang
out
like
a
brass
kettle
rolling
downstairs
,
all
the
guns
*NL*
were
lowered
.
Then
was
seen
stepping
down
from
the
carriage
a
gentleman
*NL*
in
a
short
coat
with
silver
braiding
,
with
bald
brow
,
and
wearing
a
tuft
*NL*
of
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
of
a
sallow
complexion
and
the
most
*NL*
benign
appearance
.
His
eyes
,
very
large
and
covered
by
heavy
lids
,
were
*NL*
half-closed
to
look
at
the
crowd
,
while
at
the
same
time
he
raised
his
*NL*
sharp
nose
,
and
forced
a
smile
upon
his
sunken
mouth
.
He
recognised
the
*NL*
mayor
by
his
scarf
,
and
explained
to
him
that
the
prefect
was
not
able
*NL*
to
come
.
He
himself
was
a
councillor
at
the
prefecture
;
then
he
added
*NL*
a
few
apologies
.
Monsieur
Tuvache
answered
them
with
compliments
;
the
*NL*
other
confessed
himself
nervous
;
and
they
remained
thus
,
face
to
face
,
*NL*
their
foreheads
almost
touching
,
with
the
members
of
the
jury
all
round
,
*NL*
the
municipal
council
,
the
notable
personages
,
the
National
Guard
and
*NL*
the
crowd
.
The
councillor
pressing
his
little
cocked
hat
to
his
*NL*
breast
repeated
his
bows
,
while
Tuvache
,
bent
like
a
bow
,
also
smiled
,
*NL*
stammered
,
tried
to
say
something
,
protested
his
devotion
to
the
*NL*
monarchy
and
the
honour
that
was
being
done
to
Yonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
the
groom
from
the
inn
,
took
the
head
of
the
horses
from
the
*NL*
coachman
,
and
,
limping
along
with
his
club-foot
,
led
them
to
the
door
*NL*
of
the
``
Lion
d'Or
''
,
where
a
number
of
peasants
collected
to
look
at
the
*NL*
carriage
.
The
drum
beat
,
the
howitzer
thundered
,
and
the
gentlemen
one
*NL*
by
one
mounted
the
platform
,
where
they
sat
down
in
red
utrecht
velvet
*NL*
arm-chairs
that
had
been
lent
by
Madame
Tuvache
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
people
looked
alike
.
Their
fair
flabby
faces
,
somewhat
tanned
*NL*
by
the
sun
,
were
the
colour
of
sweet
cider
,
and
their
puffy
whiskers
*NL*
emerged
from
stiff
collars
,
kept
up
by
white
cravats
with
broad
bows
.
*NL*
All
the
waist-coats
were
of
velvet
,
double-breasted
;
all
the
watches
*NL*
had
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
ribbon
,
an
oval
cornelian
seal
;
everyone
*NL*
rested
his
two
hands
on
his
thighs
,
carefully
stretching
the
stride
of
*NL*
their
trousers
,
whose
unsponged
glossy
cloth
shone
more
brilliantly
than
*NL*
the
leather
of
their
heavy
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
of
the
company
stood
at
the
back
under
the
vestibule
between
*NL*
the
pillars
while
the
common
herd
was
opposite
,
standing
up
or
sitting
*NL*
on
chairs
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
Lestiboudois
had
brought
thither
all
*NL*
those
that
he
had
moved
from
the
field
,
and
he
even
kept
running
back
*NL*
every
minute
to
fetch
others
from
the
church
.
He
caused
such
confusion
*NL*
with
this
piece
of
business
that
one
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
to
*NL*
the
small
steps
of
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Monsieur
Lheureux
to
the
chemist
,
who
was
passing
to
his
*NL*
place
,
``
that
they
ought
to
have
put
up
two
Venetian
masts
with
something
*NL*
rather
severe
and
rich
for
ornaments
;
it
would
have
been
a
very
pretty
*NL*
effect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
replied
Homais
;
``
but
what
can
you
expect
?
The
mayor
took
*NL*
everything
on
his
own
shoulders
.
He
has
n't
much
taste
.
Poor
Tuvache
!
and
*NL*
he
is
even
completely
destitute
of
what
is
called
the
genius
of
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
meanwhile
,
with
Madame
Bovary
,
had
gone
up
to
the
first
*NL*
floor
of
the
town
hall
,
to
the
``
council-room
,
''
and
,
as
it
was
empty
,
*NL*
he
declared
that
they
could
enjoy
the
sight
there
more
comfortably
.
He
*NL*
fetched
three
stools
from
the
round
table
under
the
bust
of
the
monarch
,
*NL*
and
having
carried
them
to
one
of
the
windows
,
they
sat
down
by
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
commotion
on
the
platform
,
long
whisperings
,
much
parleying
.
*NL*
At
last
the
councillor
got
up
.
They
knew
now
that
his
name
was
Lieuvain
,
*NL*
and
in
the
crowd
the
name
was
passed
from
one
to
the
other
.
After
he
had
*NL*
collated
a
few
pages
,
and
bent
over
them
to
see
better
,
he
began
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
!
May
I
be
permitted
first
of
all
-LRB-
before
addressing
you
on
*NL*
the
object
of
our
meeting
to-day
,
and
this
sentiment
will
,
I
am
sure
,
be
*NL*
shared
by
you
all
-RRB-
,
may
I
be
permitted
,
I
say
,
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
*NL*
higher
administration
,
to
the
government
to
the
monarch
,
gentle
men
,
our
*NL*
sovereign
,
to
that
beloved
king
,
to
whom
no
branch
of
public
or
private
*NL*
prosperity
is
a
matter
of
indifference
,
and
who
directs
with
a
hand
at
*NL*
once
so
firm
and
wise
the
chariot
of
the
state
amid
the
incessant
perils
*NL*
of
a
stormy
sea
,
knowing
,
moreover
,
how
to
make
peace
respected
as
well
*NL*
as
war
,
industry
,
commerce
,
agriculture
,
and
the
fine
arts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
,
''
said
Rodolphe
,
``
to
get
back
a
little
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
moment
the
voice
of
the
councillor
rose
to
an
extraordinary
*NL*
pitch
.
He
declaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
no
longer
the
time
,
gentlemen
,
when
civil
discord
ensanguined
*NL*
our
public
places
,
when
the
landlord
,
the
business-man
,
the
working-man
*NL*
himself
,
falling
asleep
at
night
,
lying
down
to
peaceful
sleep
,
trembled
*NL*
lest
he
should
be
awakened
suddenly
by
the
noise
of
incendiary
tocsins
,
*NL*
when
the
most
subversive
doctrines
audaciously
sapped
foundations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
someone
down
there
might
see
me
,
''
Rodolphe
resumed
,
``
then
*NL*
I
should
have
to
invent
excuses
for
a
fortnight
;
and
with
my
bad
*NL*
reputation
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
slandering
yourself
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
It
is
dreadful
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
gentlemen
,
''
continued
the
councillor
,
``
if
,
banishing
from
my
*NL*
memory
the
remembrance
of
these
sad
pictures
,
I
carry
my
eyes
back
*NL*
to
the
actual
situation
of
our
dear
country
,
what
do
I
see
there
?
*NL*
Everywhere
commerce
and
the
arts
are
flourishing
;
everywhere
new
means
*NL*
of
communication
,
like
so
many
new
arteries
in
the
body
of
the
state
,
*NL*
establish
within
it
new
relations
.
Our
great
industrial
centres
have
*NL*
recovered
all
their
activity
;
religion
,
more
consolidated
,
smiles
in
*NL*
all
hearts
;
our
ports
are
full
,
confidence
is
born
again
,
and
France
*NL*
breathes
once
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
added
Rodolphe
,
``
perhaps
from
the
world
's
point
of
view
they
*NL*
are
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
he
.
``
Do
you
not
know
that
there
are
souls
constantly
*NL*
tormented
?
They
need
by
turns
to
dream
and
to
act
,
the
purest
passions
*NL*
and
the
most
turbulent
joys
,
and
thus
they
fling
themselves
into
all
*NL*
sorts
of
fantasies
,
of
follies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
looked
at
him
as
one
looks
at
a
traveller
who
has
voyaged
over
*NL*
strange
lands
,
and
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
not
even
this
distraction
,
we
poor
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sad
distraction
,
for
happiness
is
n't
found
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
ever
found
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
one
day
it
comes
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
what
you
have
understood
,
''
said
the
councillor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
farmers
,
agricultural
labourers
!
you
pacific
pioneers
of
a
work
*NL*
that
belongs
wholly
to
civilization
!
you
,
men
of
progress
and
morality
,
*NL*
you
have
understood
,
I
say
,
that
political
storms
are
even
more
*NL*
redoubtable
than
atmospheric
disturbances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
comes
one
day
,
''
repeated
Rodolphe
,
``
one
day
suddenly
,
and
when
*NL*
one
is
despairing
of
it
.
Then
the
horizon
expands
;
it
is
as
if
a
voice
*NL*
cried
,
`
It
is
here
!
'
You
feel
the
need
of
confiding
the
whole
of
your
*NL*
life
,
of
giving
everything
,
sacrificing
everything
to
this
being
.
There
*NL*
is
no
need
for
explanations
;
they
understand
one
another

They
have
seen
*NL*
each
other
in
dreams

''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
And
he
looked
at
her
.
-RRB-
``
In
fine
,
here
it
is
,
this
treasure
so
sought
*NL*
after

here
before
you

It
glitters
,
it
flashes
;
yet
one
still
doubts
,
*NL*
one
does
not
believe
it

one
remains
dazzled
,
as
if
one
went
out
from
*NL*
darkness
into
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
ended
Rodolphe
suited
the
action
to
the
word
.
He
passed
his
*NL*
hand
over
his
face
,
like
a
man
seized
with
giddiness
.
Then
he
let
it
*NL*
fall
on
Emma
's
.
She
took
hers
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
would
be
surprised
at
it

gentlemen

He
only
who
is
so
blind

*NL*
so
plunged

I
do
not
fear
to
say
it
-RRB-

so
plunged
in
the
prejudices
*NL*
of
another
age
as
still
to
misunderstand
the
spirit
of
agricultural
*NL*
populations

Where
,
indeed
,
is
to
be
found
more
patriotism
than
in
the
*NL*
country
,
greater
devotion
to
the
public
welfare

more
intelligence

in
a

And

gentlemen

I
do
not
mean
that
superficial
intelligence

*NL*
vain
ornament
of
idle
minds

rather
that
profound
and
balanced
*NL*
intelligence
that
applies
itself
above
all
else
to
useful
objects

contributing
to
the
good
of

to

common
amelioration

Rodolphe

Always

objected
Madame

.

*NL*
``
No

no

out

Monsieur

had
just
wiped
his

continued

means
of
ingenious
machinery
,
comes
out
thence
under
the
name
of
flour
,
*NL*
and
from
there
,
transported
to
our
cities
,
is
soon
delivered
at
the
*NL*
baker
's
,
who
makes
it
into
food
for
poor
and
rich
alike
.
Again
,
is
it
*NL*
not
the
agriculturist
who
fattens
,
for
our
clothes
,
his
abundant
*NL*
flocks
in
the
pastures
?
For
how
should
we
clothe
ourselves
,
how
nourish
*NL*
ourselves
,
without
the
agriculturist
?
And
,
gentlemen
,
is
it
even
*NL*
necessary
to
go
so
far
for
examples
?
Who
has
not
frequently
reflected
*NL*
on
all
the
momentous
things
that
we
get
out
of
that
modest
animal
,
the
*NL*
ornament
of
poultry-yards
,
that
provides
us
at
once
with
a
soft
pillow
*NL*
for
our
bed
,
with
succulent
flesh
for
our
tables
,
and
eggs
?
But
I
should
*NL*
never
end
if
I
were
to
enumerate
one
after
the
other
all
the
different
*NL*
products
which
the
earth
,
well
cultivated
,
like
a
generous
mother
,
*NL*
lavishes
upon
her
children
.
Here
it
is
the
vine
,
elsewhere
the
apple
*NL*
tree
for
cider
,
there
colza
,
farther
on
cheeses
and
flax
.
Gentlemen
,
let
*NL*
us
not
forget
flax
,
which
has
made
such
great
strides
of
late
years
,
and
*NL*
to
which
I
will
more
particularly
call
your
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
need
to
call
it
,
for
all
the
mouths
of
the
multitude
were
wide
*NL*
open
,
as
if
to
drink
in
his
words
.
Tuvache
by
his
side
listened
to
him
*NL*
with
staring
eyes
.
Monsieur
Derozerays
from
time
to
time
softly
closed
*NL*
his
eyelids
,
and
farther
on
the
chemist
,
with
his
son
Napoleon
between
*NL*
his
knees
,
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
in
order
not
to
lose
a
syllable
.
*NL*
The
chins
of
the
other
members
of
the
jury
went
slowly
up
and
down
in
*NL*
their
waistcoats
in
sign
of
approval
.
The
firemen
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
platform
rested
on
their
bayonets
;
and
Binet
,
motionless
,
stood
with
*NL*
out-turned
elbows
,
the
point
of
his
sabre
in
the
air
.
Perhaps
he
could
*NL*
hear
,
but
certainly
he
could
see
nothing
,
because
of
the
visor
of
his
*NL*
helmet
,
that
fell
down
on
his
nose
.
His
lieutenant
,
the
youngest
son
of
*NL*
Monsieur
Tuvache
,
had
a
bigger
one
,
for
his
was
enormous
,
and
shook
on
*NL*
his
head
,
and
from
it
an
end
of
his
cotton
scarf
peeped
out
.
He
smiled
*NL*
beneath
it
with
a
perfectly
infantine
sweetness
,
and
his
pale
little
*NL*
face
,
whence
drops
were
running
,
wore
an
expression
of
enjoyment
and
*NL*
sleepiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
square
as
far
as
the
houses
was
crowded
with
people
.
One
saw
folk
*NL*
leaning
on
their
elbows
at
all
the
windows
,
others
standing
at
doors
,
*NL*
and
Justin
,
in
front
of
the
chemist
's
shop
,
seemed
quite
transfixed
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
what
he
was
looking
at
.
In
spite
of
the
silence
Monsieur
*NL*
Lieuvain
's
voice
was
lost
in
the
air
.
It
reached
you
in
fragments
of
*NL*
phrases
,
and
interrupted
here
and
there
by
the
creaking
of
chairs
in
the
*NL*
crowd
;
then
you
suddenly
heard
the
long
bellowing
of
an
ox
,
or
else
the
*NL*
bleating
of
the
lambs
,
who
answered
one
another
at
street
corners
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
the
cowherds
and
shepherds
had
driven
their
beasts
thus
far
,
and
*NL*
these
lowed
from
time
to
time
,
while
with
their
tongues
they
tore
down
*NL*
some
scrap
of
foliage
that
hung
above
their
mouths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
had
drawn
nearer
to
Emma
,
and
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
speaking
rapidly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
not
this
conspiracy
of
the
world
revolt
you
?
Is
there
a
single
*NL*
sentiment
it
does
not
condemn
?
The
noblest
instincts
,
the
purest
*NL*
sympathies
are
persecuted
,
slandered
;
and
if
at
length
two
poor
souls
do
*NL*
meet
,
all
is
so
organised
that
they
can
not
blend
together
.
Yet
they
will
*NL*
make
the
attempt
;
they
will
flutter
their
wings
;
they
will
call
upon
*NL*
each
other
.
Oh
!
no
matter
.
Sooner
or
later
,
in
six
months
,
ten
years
,
*NL*
they
will
come
together
,
will
love
;
for
fate
has
decreed
it
,
and
they
*NL*
are
born
one
for
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
arms
were
folded
across
his
knees
,
and
thus
lifting
his
face
towards
*NL*
Emma
,
close
by
her
,
he
looked
fixedly
at
her
.
She
noticed
in
his
eyes
*NL*
small
golden
lines
radiating
from
black
pupils
;
she
even
smelt
the
*NL*
perfume
of
the
pomade
that
made
his
hair
glossy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
faintness
came
over
her
;
she
recalled
the
Viscount
who
had
*NL*
waltzed
with
her
at
Vaubyessard
,
and
his
beard
exhaled
like
this
air
an
*NL*
odour
of
vanilla
and
citron
,
and
mechanically
she
half-closed
her
eyes
*NL*
the
better
to
breathe
it
in
.
But
in
making
this
movement
,
as
she
leant
*NL*
back
in
her
chair
,
she
saw
in
the
distance
,
right
on
the
line
of
the
*NL*
horizon
,
the
old
diligence
,
the
``
Hirondelle
,
''
that
was
slowly
descending
*NL*
the
hill
of
Leux
,
dragging
after
it
a
long
trail
of
dust
.
It
was
in
this
*NL*
yellow
carriage
that
Leon
had
so
often
come
back
to
her
,
and
by
this
*NL*
route
down
there
that
he
had
gone
for
ever
.
She
fancied
she
saw
him
*NL*
opposite
at
his
windows
;
then
all
grew
confused
;
clouds
gathered
;
it
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
again
turning
in
the
waltz
under
the
light
of
*NL*
the
lustres
on
the
arm
of
the
Viscount
,
and
that
Leon
was
not
far
away
,
*NL*
that
he
was
coming
;
and
yet
all
the
time
she
was
conscious
of
the
scent
*NL*
of
Rodolphe
's
head
by
her
side
.
This
sweetness
of
sensation
pierced
*NL*
through
her
old
desires
,
and
these
,
like
grains
of
sand
under
a
gust
*NL*
of
wind
,
eddied
to
and
fro
in
the
subtle
breath
of
the
perfume
which
*NL*
suffused
her
soul
.
She
opened
wide
her
nostrils
several
times
to
drink
*NL*
in
the
freshness
of
the
ivy
round
the
capitals
.
She
took
off
her
gloves
,
*NL*
she
wiped
her
hands
,
then
fanned
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
while
*NL*
athwart
the
throbbing
of
her
temples
she
heard
the
murmur
of
the
*NL*
crowd
and
the
voice
of
the
councillor
intoning
his
phrases
.
He
*NL*
said
--
``
Continue
,
persevere
;
listen
neither
to
the
suggestions
of
*NL*
routine
,
nor
to
the
over-hasty
councils
of
a
rash
empiricism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apply
yourselves
,
above
all
,
to
the
amelioration
of
the
soil
,
to
good
*NL*
manures
,
to
the
development
of
the
equine
,
bovine
,
ovine
,
and
porcine
*NL*
races
.
Let
these
shows
be
to
you
pacific
arenas
,
where
the
victor
in
*NL*
leaving
it
will
hold
forth
a
hand
to
the
vanquished
,
and
will
fraternise
*NL*
with
him
in
the
hope
of
better
success
.
And
you
,
aged
servants
,
humble
*NL*
domestics
,
whose
hard
labour
no
Government
up
to
this
day
has
taken
into
*NL*
consideration
,
come
hither
to
receive
the
reward
of
your
silent
virtues
,
*NL*
and
be
assured
that
the
state
henceforward
has
its
eye
upon
you
;
that
it
*NL*
encourages
you
,
protects
you
;
that
it
will
accede
to
your
just
*NL*
demands
,
and
alleviate
as
much
as
in
it
lies
the
burden
of
your
painful
*NL*
sacrifices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Lieuvain
then
sat
down
;
Monsieur
Derozerays
got
up
,
beginning
*NL*
another
speech
.
His
was
not
perhaps
so
florid
as
that
of
the
councillor
,
*NL*
but
it
recommended
itself
by
a
more
direct
style
,
that
is
to
say
,
by
*NL*
more
special
knowledge
and
more
elevated
considerations
.
Thus
the
praise
*NL*
of
the
Government
took
up
less
space
in
it
;
religion
and
agriculture
*NL*
more
.
He
showed
in
it
the
relations
of
these
two
,
and
how
they
had
*NL*
always
contributed
to
civilisation
.
Rodolphe
with
Madame
Bovary
was
*NL*
talking
dreams
,
presentiments
,
magnetism
.
Going
back
to
the
cradle
of
*NL*
society
,
the
orator
painted
those
fierce
times
when
men
lived
on
acorns
*NL*
in
the
heart
of
woods
.
Then
they
had
left
off
the
skins
of
beasts
,
had
*NL*
put
on
cloth
,
tilled
the
soil
,
planted
the
vine
.
Was
this
a
good
,
and
*NL*
in
this
discovery
was
there
not
more
of
injury
than
of
gain
?
Monsieur
*NL*
Derozerays
set
himself
this
problem
.
From
magnetism
little
by
little
*NL*
Rodolphe
had
come
to
affinities
,
and
while
the
president
was
citing
*NL*
Cincinnatus
and
his
plough
,
Diocletian
,
planting
his
cabbages
,
and
the
*NL*
Emperors
of
China
inaugurating
the
year
by
the
sowing
of
seed
,
the
*NL*
young
man
was
explaining
to
the
young
woman
that
these
irresistible
*NL*
attractions
find
their
cause
in
some
previous
state
of
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
we
,
''
he
said
,
``
why
did
we
come
to
know
one
another
?
What
chance
*NL*
willed
it
?
It
was
because
across
the
infinite
,
like
two
streams
that
*NL*
flow
but
to
unite
;
our
special
bents
of
mind
had
driven
us
towards
each
*NL*
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
seized
her
hand
;
she
did
not
withdraw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
good
farming
generally
!
''
cried
the
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
,

*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
was
pressing
her
hand
,
and
he
felt
it
all
warm
and
quivering
*NL*
like
a
captive
dove
that
wants
to
fly
away
;
but
,
whether
she
was
trying
*NL*
to
take
it
away
or
whether
she
was
answering
his
pressure
;
she
made
a
*NL*
movement
with
her
fingers
.
He
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

I
thank
you

not

*NL*
*NL*
A
gust
of
wind
that
blew
in
at
the
window
ruffled
the
cloth
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
in
the
square
below
all
the
great
caps
of
the
peasant
women
*NL*
were
uplifted
by
it
like
the
wings
of
white
butterflies
fluttering

*NL*
*NL*
``
Use

continued
the

.
He
was
hurrying
on

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
was
no
longer
speaking
.
They
looked
at
one
another
.
A
supreme
*NL*
desire
made
their
dry
lips
tremble
,
and
wearily
,
without
an
effort
,
*NL*
their
fingers
intertwined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

''
repeated
the
councillor
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
present
herself
,
and
one
could
hear
voices
whispering
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Tuvache

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let

come
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
came
forward
on
the
platform
a
little
old
woman
with
timid
*NL*
bearing
,
who
seemed
to
shrink
within
her
poor
clothes
.
On
her
feet
she
*NL*
wore
heavy
wooden
clogs
,
and
from
her
hips
hung
a
large
blue
apron
.
Her
*NL*
pale
face
framed
in
a
borderless
cap
was
more
wrinkled
than
a
withered
*NL*
russet
apple
.
And
from
the
sleeves
of
her
red
jacket
looked
out
two
*NL*
large
hands
with
knotty
joints
,
the
dust
of
barns
,
the
potash
of
washing
*NL*
the
grease
of
wools
had
so
encrusted
,
roughened
,
hardened
these
that
*NL*
they
seemed
dirty
,
although
they
had
been
rinsed
in
clear
water
;
and
*NL*
by
dint
of
long
service
they
remained
half
open
,
as
if
to
bear
humble
*NL*
witness
for
themselves
of
so
much
suffering
endured
.
Something
of
*NL*
monastic
rigidity
dignified
her
face
.
Nothing
of
sadness
or
of
emotion
*NL*
weakened
that
pale
look
.
In
her
constant
living
with
animals
she
had
*NL*
caught
their
dumbness
and
their
calm
.
It
was
the
first
time
that
she
*NL*
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
so
large
a
company
,
and
inwardly
scared
by
*NL*
the
flags
,
the
drums
,
the
gentlemen
in
frock-coats
,
and
the
order
of
the
*NL*
councillor
,
she
stood
motionless
,
not
knowing
whether
to
advance
or
run
*NL*
away
,
nor
why
the
crowd
was
pushing
her
and
the
jury
were
smiling
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
stood
before
these
radiant
bourgeois
this
half-century
of
*NL*
servitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Approach
,
venerable
Catherine
Nicaise
Elizabeth
Leroux
!
''
said
the
*NL*
councillor
,
who
had
taken
the
list
of
prize-winners
from
the
president
;
*NL*
and
,
looking
at
the
piece
of
paper
and
the
old
woman
by
turns
,
he
*NL*
repeated
in
a
fatherly
tone
--
``
Approach
!
approach
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
deaf
?
''
said
Tuvache
,
fidgeting
in
his
armchair
;
and
he
began
*NL*
shouting
in
her
ear
,
``
Fifty-four
years
of
service
.
A
silver
medal
!
*NL*
Twenty-five
francs
!
For
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
when
she
had
her
medal
,
she
looked
at
it
,
and
a
smile
of
beatitude
*NL*
spread
over
her
face
;
and
as
she
walked
away
they
could
hear
her
*NL*
muttering
``
I
'll
give
it
to
our
cure
up
home
,
to
say
some
masses
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fanaticism
!
''
exclaimed
the
chemist
,
leaning
across
to
the
notary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
was
over
,
the
crowd
dispersed
,
and
now
that
the
speeches
had
*NL*
been
read
,
each
one
fell
back
into
his
place
again
,
and
everything
into
*NL*
the
old
grooves
;
the
masters
bullied
the
servants
,
and
these
struck
the
*NL*
animals
,
indolent
victors
,
going
back
to
the
stalls
,
a
green-crown
on
*NL*
their
horns
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
National
Guards
,
however
,
had
gone
up
to
the
first
floor
of
the
*NL*
town
hall
with
buns
spitted
on
their
bayonets
,
and
the
drummer
of
the
*NL*
battalion
carried
a
basket
with
bottles
.
Madame
Bovary
took
Rodolphe
's
*NL*
arm
;
he
saw
her
home
;
they
separated
at
her
door
;
then
he
walked
about
*NL*
alone
in
the
meadow
while
he
waited
for
the
time
of
the
banquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
feast
was
long
,
noisy
,
ill
served
;
the
guests
were
so
crowded
that
*NL*
they
could
hardly
move
their
elbows
;
and
the
narrow
planks
used
for
*NL*
forms
almost
broke
down
under
their
weight
.
They
ate
hugely
.
Each
one
*NL*
stuffed
himself
on
his
own
account
.
Sweat
stood
on
every
brow
,
and
a
*NL*
whitish
steam
,
like
the
vapour
of
a
stream
on
an
autumn
morning
,
floated
*NL*
above
the
table
between
the
hanging
lamps
.
Rodolphe
,
leaning
against
*NL*
the
calico
of
the
tent
was
thinking
so
earnestly
of
Emma
that
he
heard
*NL*
nothing
.
Behind
him
on
the
grass
the
servants
were
piling
up
the
dirty
*NL*
plates
,
his
neighbours
were
talking
;
he
did
not
answer
them
;
they
filled
*NL*
his
glass
,
and
there
was
silence
in
his
thoughts
in
spite
of
the
growing
*NL*
noise
.
He
was
dreaming
of
what
she
had
said
,
of
the
line
of
her
lips
;
*NL*
her
face
,
as
in
a
magic
mirror
,
shone
on
the
plates
of
the
shakos
,
the
*NL*
folds
of
her
gown
fell
along
the
walls
,
and
days
of
love
unrolled
to
all
*NL*
infinity
before
him
in
the
vistas
of
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
again
in
the
evening
during
the
fireworks
,
but
she
was
with
*NL*
her
husband
,
Madame
Homais
,
and
the
druggist
,
who
was
worrying
about
the
*NL*
danger
of
stray
rockets
,
and
every
moment
he
left
the
company
to
go
and
*NL*
give
some
advice
to
Binet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pyrotechnic
pieces
sent
to
Monsieur
Tuvache
had
,
through
an
excess
*NL*
of
caution
,
been
shut
up
in
his
cellar
,
and
so
the
damp
powder
would
*NL*
not
light
,
and
the
principal
set
piece
,
that
was
to
represent
a
dragon
*NL*
biting
his
tail
,
failed
completely
.
Now
and
then
a
meagre
Roman-candle
*NL*
went
off
;
then
the
gaping
crowd
sent
up
a
shout
that
mingled
with
the
*NL*
cry
of
the
women
,
whose
waists
were
being
squeezed
in
the
darkness
.
Emma
*NL*
silently
nestled
against
Charles
's
shoulder
;
then
,
raising
her
chin
,
she
*NL*
watched
the
luminous
rays
of
the
rockets
against
the
dark
sky
.
Rodolphe
*NL*
gazed
at
her
in
the
light
of
the
burning
lanterns
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
one
by
one
.
The
stars
shone
out
.
A
few
crops
of
rain
began
*NL*
to
fall
.
She
knotted
her
fichu
round
her
bare
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
councillor
's
carriage
came
out
from
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
coachman
,
who
was
drunk
,
suddenly
dozed
off
,
and
one
could
see
from
*NL*
the
distance
,
above
the
hood
,
between
the
two
lanterns
,
the
mass
of
his
*NL*
body
,
that
swayed
from
right
to
left
with
the
giving
of
the
traces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
''
said
the
druggist
,
``
one
ought
to
proceed
most
rigorously
*NL*
against
drunkenness
!
I
should
like
to
see
written
up
weekly
at
the
door
*NL*
of
the
town
hall
on
a
board
ad
hoc
*
the
names
of
all
those
who
during
*NL*
the
week
got
intoxicated
on
alcohol
.
Besides
,
with
regard
to
statistics
,
*NL*
one
would
thus
have
,
as
it
were
,
public
records
that
one
could
refer
to
*NL*
in
case
of
need
.
But
excuse
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Specifically
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
once
more
ran
off
to
the
captain
.
The
latter
was
going
back
to
*NL*
see
his
lathe
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
would
not
do
ill
,
''
Homais
said
to
him
,
``
to
send
one
of
your
*NL*
men
,
or
to
go
yourself
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
!
''
answered
the
tax-collector
.
``
It
's
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
uneasy
,
''
said
the
druggist
,
when
he
returned
to
his
friends
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Binet
has
assured
me
that
all
precautions
have
been
taken
.
No
*NL*
sparks
have
fallen
;
the
pumps
are
full
.
Let
us
go
to
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
!
I
want
it
,
''
said
Madame
Homais
,
yawning
at
large
.
``
But
never
*NL*
mind
;
we
've
had
a
beautiful
day
for
our
fete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
repeated
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
a
tender
look
,
``
Oh
,
yes
!
very
*NL*
beautiful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
bowed
to
one
another
,
they
separated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
,
in
the
``
Final
de
Rouen
,
''
there
was
a
long
article
on
the
*NL*
show
.
Homais
had
composed
it
with
verve
the
very
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
these
festoons
,
these
flowers
,
these
garlands
?
Whither
hurries
this
*NL*
crowd
like
the
waves
of
a
furious
sea
under
the
torrents
of
a
tropical
*NL*
sun
pouring
its
heat
upon
our
heads
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
spoke
of
the
condition
of
the
peasants
.
Certainly
the
Government
*NL*
was
doing
much
,
but
not
enough
.
``
Courage
!
''
he
cried
to
it
;
``
a
thousand
*NL*
reforms
are
indispensable
;
let
us
accomplish
them
!
''
Then
touching
on
*NL*
the
entry
of
the
councillor
,
he
did
not
forget
``
the
martial
air
of
our
*NL*
militia
;
''
nor
``
our
most
merry
village
maidens
;
''
nor
the
``
bald-headed
old
*NL*
men
like
patriarchs
who
were
there
,
and
of
whom
some
,
the
remnants
of
*NL*
our
phalanxes
,
still
felt
their
hearts
beat
at
the
manly
sound
of
the
*NL*
drums
.
''
He
cited
himself
among
the
first
of
the
members
of
the
jury
,
*NL*
and
he
even
called
attention
in
a
note
to
the
fact
that
Monsieur
Homais
,
*NL*
chemist
,
had
sent
a
memoir
on
cider
to
the
agricultural
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
to
the
distribution
of
the
prizes
,
he
painted
the
joy
of
*NL*
the
prize-winners
in
dithyrambic
strophes
.
``
The
father
embraced
the
son
,
*NL*
the
brother
the
brother
,
the
husband
his
consort
.
More
than
one
showed
*NL*
his
humble
medal
with
pride
;
and
no
doubt
when
he
got
home
to
his
good
*NL*
housewife
,
he
hung
it
up
weeping
on
the
modest
walls
of
his
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
six
o'clock
a
banquet
prepared
in
the
meadow
of
Monsieur
Leigeard
*NL*
brought
together
the
principal
personages
of
the
fete
.
The
greatest
*NL*
cordiality
reigned
here
.
Divers
toasts
were
proposed
:
Monsieur
*NL*
Lieuvain
,
the
King
;
Monsieur
Tuvache
,
the
Prefect
;
Monsieur
Derozerays
,
*NL*
Agriculture
;
Monsieur
Homais
,
Industry
and
the
Fine
Arts
,
those
twin
*NL*
sisters
;
Monsieur
Leplichey
,
Progress
.
In
the
evening
some
brilliant
*NL*
fireworks
on
a
sudden
illumined
the
air
.
One
would
have
called
it
a
*NL*
veritable
kaleidoscope
,
a
real
operatic
scene
;
and
for
a
moment
our
*NL*
little
locality
might
have
thought
itself
transported
into
the
midst
of
*NL*
a
dream
of
the
`
Thousand
and
One
Nights
.
'
Let
us
state
that
no
untoward
*NL*
event
disturbed
this
family
meeting
.
''
And
he
added
``
Only
the
absence
*NL*
of
the
clergy
was
remarked
.
No
doubt
the
priests
understand
progress
in
*NL*
another
fashion
.
Just
as
you
please
,
messieurs
the
followers
of
Loyola
!

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Nine
*NL*
*NL*
Six
weeks
passed
.
Rodolphe
did
not
come
again
.
At
last
one
evening
he
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
the
show
he
had
said
to
himself
--
``
We
must
n't
go
back
too
*NL*
soon
;
that
would
be
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
had
gone
off
hunting
.
After
the
hunting
he
*NL*
had
thought
it
was
too
late
,
and
then
he
reasoned
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
from
the
first
day
she
loved
me
,
she
must
from
impatience
to
see
me
*NL*
again
love
me
more
.
Let
's
go
on
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
knew
that
his
calculation
had
been
right
when
,
on
entering
the
*NL*
room
,
he
saw
Emma
turn
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
alone
.
The
day
was
drawing
in
.
The
small
muslin
curtain
along
*NL*
the
windows
deepened
the
twilight
,
and
the
gilding
of
the
barometer
,
on
*NL*
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
,
shone
in
the
looking-glass
between
the
*NL*
meshes
of
the
coral
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
remained
standing
,
and
Emma
hardly
answered
his
first
*NL*
conventional
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
he
said
,
``
have
been
busy
.
I
have
been
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seriously
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Rodolphe
,
sitting
down
at
her
side
on
a
footstool
,
``
no
;
it
*NL*
was
because
I
did
not
want
to
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
not
guess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
again
,
but
so
hard
that
she
lowered
her
head
,
blushing
.
*NL*
He
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
she
said
,
drawing
back
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
see
,
''
replied
he
in
a
melancholy
voice
,
``
that
I
was
right
not
*NL*
to
come
back
;
for
this
name
,
this
name
that
fills
my
whole
soul
,
and
*NL*
that
escaped
me
,
you
forbid
me
to
use
!
Madame
Bovary
!
why
all
the
*NL*
world
calls
you
thus
!
Besides
,
it
is
not
your
name
;
it
is
the
name
of
*NL*
another
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
,
``
of
another
!
''
And
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
of
you
constantly
.
The
memory
of
you
drives
me
to
despair
.
*NL*
Ah
!
forgive
me
!
I
will
leave
you
!
Farewell
!
I
will
go
far
away
,
so
far
*NL*
that
you
will
never
hear
of
me
again
;
and
yet
--
to-day
--
I
know
not
what
*NL*
force
impelled
me
towards
you
.
For
one
does
not
struggle
against
Heaven
;
*NL*
one
can
not
resist
the
smile
of
angels
;
one
is
carried
away
by
that
which
*NL*
is
beautiful
,
charming
,
adorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
that
Emma
had
heard
such
words
spoken
to
herself
,
*NL*
and
her
pride
,
like
one
who
reposes
bathed
in
warmth
,
expanded
softly
*NL*
and
fully
at
this
glowing
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
did
not
come
,
''
he
continued
,
``
if
I
could
not
see
you
,
at
least
*NL*
I
have
gazed
long
on
all
that
surrounds
you
.
At
night-every
night-I
*NL*
arose
;
I
came
hither
;
I
watched
your
house
,
its
glimmering
in
the
moon
,
*NL*
the
trees
in
the
garden
swaying
before
your
window
,
and
the
little
lamp
,
*NL*
a
gleam
shining
through
the
window-panes
in
the
darkness
.
Ah
!
you
never
*NL*
knew
that
there
,
so
near
you
,
so
far
from
you
,
was
a
poor
wretch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
towards
him
with
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
good
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
love
you
,
that
is
all
!
You
do
not
doubt
that
!
Tell
me
--
one
*NL*
word
--
only
one
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Rodolphe
imperceptibly
glided
from
the
footstool
to
the
ground
;
but
*NL*
a
sound
of
wooden
shoes
was
heard
in
the
kitchen
,
and
he
noticed
the
*NL*
door
of
the
room
was
not
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
it
would
be
of
you
,
''
he
went
on
,
rising
,
``
if
you
would
humour
*NL*
a
whim
of
mine
.
''
It
was
to
go
over
her
house
;
he
wanted
to
know
it
;
and
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
seeing
no
objection
to
this
,
they
both
rose
,
when
Charles
*NL*
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
doctor
,
''
Rodolphe
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
flattered
at
this
unexpected
title
,
launched
out
into
*NL*
obsequious
phrases
.
Of
this
the
other
took
advantage
to
pull
himself
*NL*
together
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
was
speaking
to
me
,
''
he
then
said
,
``
about
her
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
interrupted
him
;
he
had
indeed
a
thousand
anxieties
;
his
wife
's
*NL*
palpitations
of
the
heart
were
beginning
again
.
Then
Rodolphe
asked
if
*NL*
riding
would
not
be
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
!
excellent
!
just
the
thing
!
There
's
an
idea
!
You
ought
to
*NL*
follow
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
she
objected
that
she
had
no
horse
,
Monsieur
Rodolphe
offered
*NL*
one
.
She
refused
his
offer
;
he
did
not
insist
.
Then
to
explain
his
visit
*NL*
he
said
that
his
ploughman
,
the
man
of
the
blood-letting
,
still
suffered
*NL*
from
giddiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
around
,
''
said
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
I
'll
send
him
to
you
;
we
'll
come
;
that
will
be
more
convenient
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
very
good
!
I
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
accept
Monsieur
*NL*
Boulanger
's
kind
offer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
assumed
a
sulky
air
,
invented
a
thousand
excuses
,
and
finally
*NL*
declared
that
perhaps
it
would
look
odd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
the
deuce
do
I
care
for
that
?
''
said
Charles
,
making
a
*NL*
pirouette
.
``
Health
before
everything
!
You
are
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
think
I
can
ride
when
I
have
n't
got
a
habit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
order
one
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
riding-habit
decided
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
habit
was
ready
,
Charles
wrote
to
Monsieur
Boulanger
that
his
*NL*
wife
was
at
his
command
,
and
that
they
counted
on
his
good-nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
at
noon
Rodolphe
appeared
at
Charles
's
door
with
two
*NL*
saddle-horses
.
One
had
pink
rosettes
at
his
ears
and
a
deerskin
*NL*
side-saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
had
put
on
high
soft
boots
,
saying
to
himself
that
no
doubt
she
*NL*
had
never
seen
anything
like
them
.
In
fact
,
Emma
was
charmed
with
his
*NL*
appearance
as
he
stood
on
the
landing
in
his
great
velvet
coat
and
white
*NL*
corduroy
breeches
.
She
was
ready
;
she
was
waiting
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Justin
escaped
from
the
chemist
's
to
see
her
start
,
and
the
chemist
also
*NL*
came
out
.
He
was
giving
Monsieur
Boulanger
a
little
good
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
accident
happens
so
easily
.
Be
careful
!
Your
horses
perhaps
are
*NL*
mettlesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
a
noise
above
her
;
it
was
Felicite
drumming
on
the
windowpanes
*NL*
to
amuse
little
Berthe
.
The
child
blew
her
a
kiss
;
her
mother
answered
*NL*
with
a
wave
of
her
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pleasant
ride
!
''
cried
Monsieur
Homais
.
``
Prudence
!
above
all
,
*NL*
prudence
!
''
And
he
flourished
his
newspaper
as
he
saw
them
disappear
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
felt
the
ground
,
Emma
's
horse
set
off
at
a
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
galloped
by
her
side
.
Now
and
then
they
exchanged
a
word
.
Her
*NL*
figure
slightly
bent
,
her
hand
well
up
,
and
her
right
arm
stretched
out
,
*NL*
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
cadence
of
the
movement
that
rocked
her
in
*NL*
her
saddle
.
At
the
bottom
of
the
hill
Rodolphe
gave
his
horse
its
head
;
*NL*
they
started
together
at
a
bound
,
then
at
the
top
suddenly
the
horses
*NL*
stopped
,
and
her
large
blue
veil
fell
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
early
in
October
.
There
was
fog
over
the
land
.
Hazy
clouds
*NL*
hovered
on
the
horizon
between
the
outlines
of
the
hills
;
others
,
rent
*NL*
asunder
,
floated
up
and
disappeared
.
Sometimes
through
a
rift
in
the
*NL*
clouds
,
beneath
a
ray
of
sunshine
,
gleamed
from
afar
the
roots
of
*NL*
Yonville
,
with
the
gardens
at
the
water
's
edge
,
the
yards
,
the
walls
and
*NL*
the
church
steeple
.
Emma
half
closed
her
eyes
to
pick
out
her
house
,
and
*NL*
never
had
this
poor
village
where
she
lived
appeared
so
small
.
From
the
*NL*
height
on
which
they
were
the
whole
valley
seemed
an
immense
pale
lake
*NL*
sending
off
its
vapour
into
the
air
.
Clumps
of
trees
here
and
there
*NL*
stood
out
like
black
rocks
,
and
the
tall
lines
of
the
poplars
that
rose
*NL*
above
the
mist
were
like
a
beach
stirred
by
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
side
,
on
the
turf
between
the
pines
,
a
brown
light
shimmered
*NL*
in
the
warm
atmosphere
.
The
earth
,
ruddy
like
the
powder
of
tobacco
,
*NL*
deadened
the
noise
of
their
steps
,
and
with
the
edge
of
their
shoes
the
*NL*
horses
as
they
walked
kicked
the
fallen
fir
cones
in
front
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
and
Emma
thus
went
along
the
skirt
of
the
wood
.
She
turned
*NL*
away
from
time
to
time
to
avoid
his
look
,
and
then
she
saw
only
the
pine
*NL*
trunks
in
lines
,
whose
monotonous
succession
made
her
a
little
giddy
.
*NL*
The
horses
were
panting
;
the
leather
of
the
saddles
creaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
they
were
entering
the
forest
the
sun
shone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
protects
us
!
''
said
Rodolphe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forward
!
forward
!
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
``
tchk
'd
''
with
his
tongue
.
The
two
beasts
set
off
at
a
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
ferns
by
the
roadside
caught
in
Emma
's
stirrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
leant
forward
and
removed
them
as
they
rode
along
.
At
other
*NL*
times
,
to
turn
aside
the
branches
,
he
passed
close
to
her
,
and
Emma
felt
*NL*
his
knee
brushing
against
her
leg
.
The
sky
was
now
blue
,
the
leaves
no
*NL*
longer
stirred
.
There
were
spaces
full
of
heather
in
flower
,
and
plots
*NL*
of
violets
alternated
with
the
confused
patches
of
the
trees
that
were
*NL*
grey
,
fawn
,
or
golden
coloured
,
according
to
the
nature
of
their
leaves
.
*NL*
Often
in
the
thicket
was
heard
the
fluttering
of
wings
,
or
else
the
*NL*
hoarse
,
soft
cry
of
the
ravens
flying
off
amidst
the
oaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dismounted
.
Rodolphe
fastened
up
the
horses
.
She
walked
on
in
*NL*
front
on
the
moss
between
the
paths
.
But
her
long
habit
got
in
her
way
,
*NL*
although
she
held
it
up
by
the
skirt
;
and
Rodolphe
,
walking
behind
her
,
*NL*
saw
between
the
black
cloth
and
the
black
shoe
the
fineness
of
her
white
*NL*
stocking
,
that
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
her
nakedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
.
``
I
am
tired
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
try
again
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Courage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
some
hundred
paces
farther
on
she
again
stopped
,
and
through
her
*NL*
veil
,
that
fell
sideways
from
her
man
's
hat
over
her
hips
,
her
face
*NL*
appeared
in
a
bluish
transparency
as
if
she
were
floating
under
azure
*NL*
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
we
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
.
She
was
breathing
irregularly
.
Rodolphe
looked
round
*NL*
him
biting
his
moustache
.
They
came
to
a
larger
space
where
the
coppice
*NL*
had
been
cut
.
They
sat
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
,
and
Rodolphe
*NL*
began
speaking
to
her
of
his
love
.
He
did
not
begin
by
frightening
her
*NL*
with
compliments
.
He
was
calm
,
serious
,
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
listened
to
him
with
bowed
head
,
and
stirred
the
bits
of
wood
on
*NL*
the
ground
with
the
tip
of
her
foot
.
But
at
the
words
,
``
Are
not
our
*NL*
destinies
now
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
she
replied
.
``
You
know
that
well
.
It
is
impossible
!
''
She
rose
*NL*
to
go
.
He
seized
her
by
the
wrist
.
She
stopped
.
Then
,
having
gazed
*NL*
at
him
for
a
few
moments
with
an
amorous
and
humid
look
,
she
said
*NL*
hurriedly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
do
not
speak
of
it
again
!
Where
are
the
horses
?
Let
us
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
gesture
of
anger
and
annoyance
.
She
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
horses
?
Where
are
the
horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
smiling
a
strange
smile
,
his
pupil
fixed
,
his
teeth
set
,
he
*NL*
advanced
with
outstretched
arms
.
She
recoiled
trembling
.
She
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
frighten
me
!
You
hurt
me
!
Let
me
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
must
be
,
''
he
went
on
,
his
face
changing
;
and
he
again
became
*NL*
respectful
,
caressing
,
timid
.
She
gave
him
her
arm
.
They
went
back
.
He
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
matter
with
you
?
Why
?
I
do
not
understand
.
You
were
*NL*
mistaken
,
no
doubt
.
In
my
soul
you
are
as
a
Madonna
on
a
pedestal
,
in
*NL*
a
place
lofty
,
secure
,
immaculate
.
But
I
need
you
to
live
!
I
must
have
*NL*
your
eyes
,
your
voice
,
your
thought
!
Be
my
friend
,
my
sister
,
my
angel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
put
out
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
She
feebly
tried
to
disengage
*NL*
herself
.
He
supported
her
thus
as
they
walked
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
heard
the
two
horses
browsing
on
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
one
moment
!
''
said
Rodolphe
.
``
Do
not
let
us
go
!
Stay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
her
farther
on
to
a
small
pool
where
duckweeds
made
a
greenness
*NL*
on
the
water
.
Faded
water
lilies
lay
motionless
between
the
reeds
.
*NL*
At
the
noise
of
their
steps
in
the
grass
,
frogs
jumped
away
to
hide
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
wrong
!
I
am
wrong
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
am
mad
to
listen
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Emma
!
Emma
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Rodolphe
!
''
said
the
young
woman
slowly
,
leaning
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cloth
of
her
habit
caught
against
the
velvet
of
his
coat
.
She
threw
*NL*
back
her
white
neck
,
swelling
with
a
sigh
,
and
faltering
,
in
tears
,
with
*NL*
a
long
shudder
and
hiding
her
face
,
she
gave
herself
up
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
shades
of
night
were
falling
;
the
horizontal
sun
passing
between
the
*NL*
branches
dazzled
the
eyes
.
Here
and
there
around
her
,
in
the
leaves
*NL*
or
on
the
ground
,
trembled
luminous
patches
,
as
it
hummingbirds
flying
*NL*
about
had
scattered
their
feathers
.
Silence
was
everywhere
;
something
*NL*
sweet
seemed
to
come
forth
from
the
trees
;
she
felt
her
heart
,
whose
*NL*
beating
had
begun
again
,
and
the
blood
coursing
through
her
flesh
like
a
*NL*
stream
of
milk
.
Then
far
away
,
beyond
the
wood
,
on
the
other
hills
,
she
*NL*
heard
a
vague
prolonged
cry
,
a
voice
which
lingered
,
and
in
silence
she
*NL*
heard
it
mingling
like
music
with
the
last
pulsations
of
her
throbbing
*NL*
nerves
.
Rodolphe
,
a
cigar
between
his
lips
,
was
mending
with
his
*NL*
penknife
one
of
the
two
broken
bridles
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
to
Yonville
by
the
same
road
.
On
the
mud
they
saw
again
*NL*
the
traces
of
their
horses
side
by
side
,
the
same
thickets
,
the
same
*NL*
stones
to
the
grass
;
nothing
around
them
seemed
changed
;
and
yet
for
her
*NL*
something
had
happened
more
stupendous
than
if
the
mountains
had
moved
*NL*
in
their
places
.
Rodolphe
now
and
again
bent
forward
and
took
her
hand
*NL*
to
kiss
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
charming
on
horseback
--
upright
,
with
her
slender
waist
,
her
knee
*NL*
bent
on
the
mane
of
her
horse
,
her
face
somewhat
flushed
by
the
fresh
*NL*
air
in
the
red
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
Yonville
she
made
her
horse
prance
in
the
road
.
People
*NL*
looked
at
her
from
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
her
husband
thought
she
looked
well
,
but
she
pretended
not
to
*NL*
hear
him
when
he
inquired
about
her
ride
,
and
she
remained
sitting
there
*NL*
with
her
elbow
at
the
side
of
her
plate
between
the
two
lighted
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
spent
the
afternoon
at
Monsieur
Alexandre
's
.
He
has
an
old
cob
,
*NL*
still
very
fine
,
only
a
little
broken-kneed
,
and
that
could
be
bought
;
I
*NL*
am
sure
,
for
a
hundred
crowns
.
''
He
added
,
``
And
thinking
it
might
please
*NL*
you
,
I
have
bespoken
it
--
bought
it
.
Have
I
done
right
?
Do
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
her
head
in
assent
;
then
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
out
to-night
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
nothing
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
soon
as
she
had
got
rid
of
Charles
she
went
and
shut
herself
up
*NL*
in
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
she
felt
stunned
;
she
saw
the
trees
,
the
paths
,
the
ditches
,
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
and
she
again
felt
the
pressure
of
his
arm
,
while
the
leaves
*NL*
rustled
and
the
reeds
whistled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
saw
herself
in
the
glass
she
wondered
at
her
face
.
Never
*NL*
had
her
eyes
been
so
large
,
so
black
,
of
so
profound
a
depth
.
Something
*NL*
subtle
about
her
being
transfigured
her
.
She
repeated
,
``
I
have
a
lover
!
*NL*
a
lover
!
''
delighting
at
the
idea
as
if
a
second
puberty
had
come
to
her
.
*NL*
So
at
last
she
was
to
know
those
joys
of
love
,
that
fever
of
happiness
*NL*
of
which
she
had
despaired
!
She
was
entering
upon
marvels
where
all
*NL*
would
be
passion
,
ecstasy
,
delirium
.
An
azure
infinity
encompassed
*NL*
her
,
the
heights
of
sentiment
sparkled
under
her
thought
,
and
ordinary
*NL*
existence
appeared
only
afar
off
,
down
below
in
the
shade
,
through
the
*NL*
interspaces
of
these
heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
recalled
the
heroines
of
the
books
that
she
had
read
,
and
the
*NL*
lyric
legion
of
these
adulterous
women
began
to
sing
in
her
memory
with
*NL*
the
voice
of
sisters
that
charmed
her
.
She
became
herself
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
an
actual
part
of
these
imaginings
,
and
realised
the
love-dream
of
her
*NL*
youth
as
she
saw
herself
in
this
type
of
amorous
women
whom
she
had
*NL*
so
envied
.
Besides
,
Emma
felt
a
satisfaction
of
revenge
.
Had
she
not
*NL*
suffered
enough
?
But
now
she
triumphed
,
and
the
love
so
long
pent
up
*NL*
burst
forth
in
full
joyous
bubblings
.
She
tasted
it
without
remorse
,
*NL*
without
anxiety
,
without
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
following
passed
with
a
new
sweetness
.
They
made
vows
to
one
*NL*
another
She
told
him
of
her
sorrows
.
Rodolphe
interrupted
her
with
*NL*
kisses
;
and
she
looking
at
him
through
half-closed
eyes
,
asked
him
to
*NL*
call
her
again
by
her
name
--
to
say
that
he
loved
her
They
were
in
the
*NL*
forest
,
as
yesterday
,
in
the
shed
of
some
woodenshoe
maker
.
The
walls
*NL*
were
of
straw
,
and
the
roof
so
low
they
had
to
stoop
.
They
were
seated
*NL*
side
by
side
on
a
bed
of
dry
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
forth
they
wrote
to
one
another
regularly
every
evening
.
*NL*
Emma
placed
her
letter
at
the
end
of
the
garden
,
by
the
river
,
in
a
*NL*
fissure
of
the
wall
.
Rodolphe
came
to
fetch
it
,
and
put
another
there
,
*NL*
that
she
always
found
fault
with
as
too
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
when
Charles
had
gone
out
before
day
break
,
she
was
seized
*NL*
with
the
fancy
to
see
Rodolphe
at
once
.
She
would
go
quickly
to
La
*NL*
Huchette
,
stay
there
an
hour
,
and
be
back
again
at
Yonville
while
*NL*
everyone
was
still
asleep
.
This
idea
made
her
pant
with
desire
,
and
she
*NL*
soon
found
herself
in
the
middle
of
the
field
,
walking
with
rapid
steps
,
*NL*
without
looking
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
was
just
breaking
.
Emma
from
afar
recognised
her
lover
's
house
.
Its
*NL*
two
dove-tailed
weathercocks
stood
out
black
against
the
pale
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
farmyard
there
was
a
detached
building
that
she
thought
must
*NL*
be
the
chateau
She
entered
--
it
was
if
the
doors
at
her
approach
had
*NL*
opened
wide
of
their
own
accord
.
A
large
straight
staircase
led
up
to
*NL*
the
corridor
.
Emma
raised
the
latch
of
a
door
,
and
suddenly
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
room
she
saw
a
man
sleeping
.
It
was
Rodolphe
.
She
uttered
a
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
here
?
You
here
?
''
he
repeated
.
``
How
did
you
manage
to
come
?
Ah
!
your
*NL*
dress
is
damp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
,
''
she
answered
,
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
piece
of
daring
successful
,
now
every
time
Charles
went
out
*NL*
early
Emma
dressed
quickly
and
slipped
on
tiptoe
down
the
steps
that
led
*NL*
to
the
waterside
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
plank
for
the
cows
was
taken
up
,
she
had
to
go
by
the
walls
*NL*
alongside
of
the
river
;
the
bank
was
slippery
;
in
order
not
to
fall
*NL*
she
caught
hold
of
the
tufts
of
faded
wallflowers
.
Then
she
went
across
*NL*
ploughed
fields
,
in
which
she
sank
,
stumbling
;
and
clogging
her
thin
*NL*
shoes
.
Her
scarf
,
knotted
round
her
head
,
fluttered
to
the
wind
in
the
*NL*
meadows
.
She
was
afraid
of
the
oxen
;
she
began
to
run
;
she
arrived
out
*NL*
of
breath
,
with
rosy
cheeks
,
and
breathing
out
from
her
whole
person
a
*NL*
fresh
perfume
of
sap
,
of
verdure
,
of
the
open
air
.
At
this
hour
Rodolphe
*NL*
still
slept
.
It
was
like
a
spring
morning
coming
into
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
yellow
curtains
along
the
windows
let
a
heavy
,
whitish
light
enter
*NL*
softly
.
Emma
felt
about
,
opening
and
closing
her
eyes
,
while
the
drops
*NL*
of
dew
hanging
from
her
hair
formed
,
as
it
were
,
a
topaz
aureole
around
*NL*
her
face
.
Rodolphe
,
laughing
,
drew
her
to
him
,
and
pressed
her
to
his
*NL*
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
examined
the
apartment
,
opened
the
drawers
of
the
tables
,
*NL*
combed
her
hair
with
his
comb
,
and
looked
at
herself
in
his
*NL*
shaving-glass
.
Often
she
even
put
between
her
teeth
the
big
pipe
that
*NL*
lay
on
the
table
by
the
bed
,
amongst
lemons
and
pieces
of
sugar
near
a
*NL*
bottle
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
them
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
to
say
goodbye
.
Then
Emma
cried
.
*NL*
She
would
have
wished
never
to
leave
Rodolphe
.
Something
stronger
than
*NL*
herself
forced
her
to
him
;
so
much
so
,
that
one
day
,
seeing
her
come
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
he
frowned
as
one
put
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
she
said
.
``
Are
you
ill
?
Tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
declared
with
a
serious
air
that
her
visits
were
becoming
*NL*
imprudent
--
that
she
was
compromising
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Ten
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
Rodolphe
's
fears
took
possession
of
her
.
At
first
,
love
had
*NL*
intoxicated
her
;
and
she
had
thought
of
nothing
beyond
.
But
now
that
he
*NL*
was
indispensable
to
her
life
,
she
feared
to
lose
anything
of
this
,
or
*NL*
even
that
it
should
be
disturbed
.
When
she
came
back
from
his
house
she
*NL*
looked
all
about
her
,
anxiously
watching
every
form
that
passed
in
the
*NL*
horizon
,
and
every
village
window
from
which
she
could
be
seen
.
She
*NL*
listened
for
steps
,
cries
,
the
noise
of
the
ploughs
,
and
she
stopped
*NL*
short
,
white
,
and
trembling
more
than
the
aspen
leaves
swaying
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
as
she
was
thus
returning
,
she
suddenly
thought
she
saw
the
*NL*
long
barrel
of
a
carbine
that
seemed
to
be
aimed
at
her
.
It
stuck
out
*NL*
sideways
from
the
end
of
a
small
tub
half-buried
in
the
grass
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
a
ditch
.
Emma
,
half-fainting
with
terror
,
nevertheless
walked
*NL*
on
,
and
a
man
stepped
out
of
the
tub
like
a
Jack-in-the-box
.
He
had
*NL*
gaiters
buckled
up
to
the
knees
,
his
cap
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
,
*NL*
trembling
lips
,
and
a
red
nose
.
It
was
Captain
Binet
lying
in
ambush
for
*NL*
wild
ducks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
called
out
long
ago
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
When
one
sees
a
*NL*
gun
,
one
should
always
give
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tax-collector
was
thus
trying
to
hide
the
fright
he
had
had
,
for
*NL*
a
prefectorial
order
having
prohibited
duckhunting
except
in
boats
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Binet
,
despite
his
respect
for
the
laws
,
was
infringing
them
,
*NL*
and
so
he
every
moment
expected
to
see
the
rural
guard
turn
up
.
But
*NL*
this
anxiety
whetted
his
pleasure
,
and
,
all
alone
in
his
tub
,
he
*NL*
congratulated
himself
on
his
luck
and
on
his
cuteness
.
At
sight
of
*NL*
Emma
he
seemed
relieved
from
a
great
weight
,
and
at
once
entered
upon
a
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
warm
;
it
's
nipping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
answered
nothing
.
He
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
out
so
early
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
stammering
;
``
I
am
just
coming
from
the
nurse
where
my
*NL*
child
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
very
good
!
very
good
!
For
myself
,
I
am
here
,
just
as
you
see
me
,
*NL*
since
break
of
day
;
but
the
weather
is
so
muggy
,
that
unless
one
had
the
*NL*
bird
at
the
mouth
of
the
gun
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Monsieur
Binet
,
''
she
interrupted
him
,
turning
on
her
*NL*
heel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
servant
,
madame
,
''
he
replied
drily
;
and
he
went
back
into
his
tub
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
regretted
having
left
the
tax-collector
so
abruptly
.
No
doubt
he
*NL*
would
form
unfavourable
conjectures
.
The
story
about
the
nurse
was
the
*NL*
worst
possible
excuse
,
everyone
at
Yonville
knowing
that
the
little
*NL*
Bovary
had
been
at
home
with
her
parents
for
a
year
.
Besides
,
no
one
*NL*
was
living
in
this
direction
;
this
path
led
only
to
La
Huchette
.
Binet
,
*NL*
then
,
would
guess
whence
she
came
,
and
he
would
not
keep
silence
;
he
*NL*
would
talk
,
that
was
certain
.
She
remained
until
evening
racking
her
*NL*
brain
with
every
conceivable
lying
project
,
and
had
constantly
before
*NL*
her
eyes
that
imbecile
with
the
game-bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
after
dinner
,
seeing
her
gloomy
,
proposed
,
by
way
of
*NL*
distraction
,
to
take
her
to
the
chemist
's
,
and
the
first
person
she
*NL*
caught
sight
of
in
the
shop
was
the
taxcollector
again
.
He
was
standing
*NL*
in
front
of
the
counter
,
lit
up
by
the
gleams
of
the
red
bottle
,
and
was
*NL*
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
give
me
half
an
ounce
of
vitriol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justin
,
''
cried
the
druggist
,
``
bring
us
the
sulphuric
acid
.
''
Then
to
*NL*
Emma
,
who
was
going
up
to
Madame
Homais
'
room
,
``
No
,
stay
here
;
it
is
n't
*NL*
worth
while
going
up
;
she
is
just
coming
down
.
Warm
yourself
at
the
*NL*
stove
in
the
meantime
.
Excuse
me
.
Good-day
,
doctor
,
''
-LRB-
for
the
chemist
*NL*
much
enjoyed
pronouncing
the
word
``
doctor
,
''
as
if
addressing
another
by
*NL*
it
reflected
on
himself
some
of
the
grandeur
that
he
found
in
it
-RRB-
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
take
care
not
to
upset
the
mortars
!
You
'd
better
fetch
some
chairs
from
*NL*
the
little
room
;
you
know
very
well
that
the
arm-chairs
are
not
to
be
*NL*
taken
out
of
the
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
put
his
arm-chair
back
in
its
place
he
was
darting
away
from
the
*NL*
counter
,
when
Binet
asked
him
for
half
an
ounce
of
sugar
acid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sugar
acid
!
''
said
the
chemist
contemptuously
,
``
do
n't
know
it
;
I
'm
*NL*
ignorant
of
it
!
But
perhaps
you
want
oxalic
acid
.
It
is
oxalic
acid
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Binet
explained
that
he
wanted
a
corrosive
to
make
himself
some
*NL*
copperwater
with
which
to
remove
rust
from
his
hunting
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
shuddered
.
The
chemist
began
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
the
weather
is
not
propitious
on
account
of
the
damp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
replied
the
tax-collector
,
with
a
sly
look
,
``
there
are
*NL*
people
who
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
stifling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
give
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
he
never
go
?
''
thought
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
an
ounce
of
resin
and
turpentine
,
four
ounces
of
yellow
wax
,
*NL*
and
three
half
ounces
of
animal
charcoal
,
if
you
please
,
to
clean
the
*NL*
varnished
leather
of
my
togs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
was
beginning
to
cut
the
wax
when
Madame
Homais
appeared
,
*NL*
Irma
in
her
arms
,
Napoleon
by
her
side
,
and
Athalie
following
.
She
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
velvet
seat
by
the
window
,
and
the
lad
squatted
down
on
a
*NL*
footstool
,
while
his
eldest
sister
hovered
round
the
jujube
box
near
*NL*
her
papa
.
The
latter
was
filling
funnels
and
corking
phials
,
sticking
on
*NL*
labels
,
making
up
parcels
.
Around
him
all
were
silent
;
only
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
were
heard
the
weights
jingling
in
the
balance
,
and
a
few
low
*NL*
words
from
the
chemist
giving
directions
to
his
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
's
the
little
woman
?
''
suddenly
asked
Madame
Homais
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
exclaimed
her
husband
,
who
was
writing
down
some
figures
in
*NL*
his
waste-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
bring
her
?
''
she
went
on
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
hush
!
''
said
Emma
,
pointing
with
her
finger
to
the
druggist
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Binet
,
quite
absorbed
in
looking
over
his
bill
,
had
probably
heard
*NL*
nothing
.
At
last
he
went
out
.
Then
Emma
,
relieved
,
uttered
a
deep
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
hard
you
are
breathing
!
''
said
Madame
Homais
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
it
's
rather
warm
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
next
day
they
talked
over
how
to
arrange
their
rendezvous
.
Emma
*NL*
wanted
to
bribe
her
servant
with
a
present
,
but
it
would
be
better
to
*NL*
find
some
safe
house
at
Yonville
.
Rodolphe
promised
to
look
for
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
the
winter
,
three
or
four
times
a
week
,
in
the
dead
of
night
*NL*
he
came
to
the
garden
.
Emma
had
on
purpose
taken
away
the
key
of
the
*NL*
gate
,
which
Charles
thought
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
call
her
,
Rodolphe
threw
a
sprinkle
of
sand
at
the
shutters
.
She
*NL*
jumped
up
with
a
start
;
but
sometimes
he
had
to
wait
,
for
Charles
had
a
*NL*
mania
for
chatting
by
the
fireside
,
and
he
would
not
stop
.
She
was
wild
*NL*
with
impatience
;
if
her
eyes
could
have
done
it
,
she
would
have
hurled
*NL*
him
out
at
the
window
.
At
last
she
would
begin
to
undress
,
then
take
up
*NL*
a
book
,
and
go
on
reading
very
quietly
as
if
the
book
amused
her
.
But
*NL*
Charles
,
who
was
in
bed
,
called
to
her
to
come
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
Emma
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
is
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
coming
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
the
candles
dazzled
him
;
he
turned
to
the
wall
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
She
escaped
,
smiling
,
palpitating
,
undressed
.
Rodolphe
had
a
large
*NL*
cloak
;
he
wrapped
her
in
it
,
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
he
*NL*
drew
her
without
a
word
to
the
end
of
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
arbour
,
on
the
same
seat
of
old
sticks
where
formerly
Leon
*NL*
had
looked
at
her
so
amorously
on
the
summer
evenings
.
She
never
thought
*NL*
of
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stars
shone
through
the
leafless
jasmine
branches
.
Behind
them
they
*NL*
heard
the
river
flowing
,
and
now
and
again
on
the
bank
the
rustling
*NL*
of
the
dry
reeds
.
Masses
of
shadow
here
and
there
loomed
out
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
sometimes
,
vibrating
with
one
movement
,
they
rose
up
and
*NL*
swayed
like
immense
black
waves
pressing
forward
to
engulf
them
.
The
*NL*
cold
of
the
nights
made
them
clasp
closer
;
the
sighs
of
their
lips
*NL*
seemed
to
them
deeper
;
their
eyes
that
they
could
hardly
see
,
larger
;
*NL*
and
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
low
words
were
spoken
that
fell
on
*NL*
their
souls
sonorous
,
crystalline
,
and
that
reverberated
in
multiplied
*NL*
vibrations
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
night
was
rainy
,
they
took
refuge
in
the
consulting-room
*NL*
between
the
cart-shed
and
the
stable
.
She
lighted
one
of
the
kitchen
*NL*
candles
that
she
had
hidden
behind
the
books
.
Rodolphe
settled
down
*NL*
there
as
if
at
home
.
The
sight
of
the
library
,
of
the
bureau
,
of
the
*NL*
whole
apartment
,
in
fine
,
excited
his
merriment
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
making
jokes
about
Charles
,
which
rather
embarrassed
Emma
.
*NL*
She
would
have
liked
to
see
him
more
serious
,
and
even
on
occasions
*NL*
more
dramatic
;
as
,
for
example
,
when
she
thought
she
heard
a
noise
of
*NL*
approaching
steps
in
the
alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
is
coming
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
blew
out
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
your
pistols
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
defend
yourself
,
''
replied
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
your
husband
?
Oh
,
poor
devil
!
''
And
Rodolphe
finished
his
sentence
*NL*
with
a
gesture
that
said
,
``
I
could
crush
him
with
a
flip
of
my
finger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
wonder-stricken
at
his
bravery
,
although
she
felt
in
it
a
sort
*NL*
of
indecency
and
a
naive
coarseness
that
scandalised
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
reflected
a
good
deal
on
the
affair
of
the
pistols
.
If
she
had
*NL*
spoken
seriously
,
it
was
very
ridiculous
,
he
thought
,
even
odious
;
for
*NL*
he
had
no
reason
to
hate
the
good
Charles
,
not
being
what
is
called
*NL*
devoured
by
jealousy
;
and
on
this
subject
Emma
had
taken
a
great
vow
*NL*
that
he
did
not
think
in
the
best
of
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
she
was
growing
very
sentimental
.
She
had
insisted
on
*NL*
exchanging
miniatures
;
they
had
cut
off
handfuls
of
hair
,
and
now
she
*NL*
was
asking
for
a
ring
--
a
real
wedding-ring
,
in
sign
of
an
eternal
union
.
*NL*
She
often
spoke
to
him
of
the
evening
chimes
,
of
the
voices
of
nature
.
*NL*
Then
she
talked
to
him
of
her
mother
--
hers
!
and
of
his
mother
--
his
!
*NL*
Rodolphe
had
lost
his
twenty
years
ago
.
Emma
none
the
less
consoled
*NL*
him
with
caressing
words
as
one
would
have
done
a
lost
child
,
and
she
*NL*
sometimes
even
said
to
him
,
gazing
at
the
moon
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
that
above
there
together
they
approve
of
our
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
so
pretty
.
He
had
possessed
so
few
women
of
such
*NL*
ingenuousness
.
This
love
without
debauchery
was
a
new
experience
for
*NL*
him
,
and
,
drawing
him
out
of
his
lazy
habits
,
caressed
at
once
his
pride
*NL*
and
his
sensuality
.
Emma
's
enthusiasm
,
which
his
bourgeois
good
sense
*NL*
disdained
,
seemed
to
him
in
his
heart
of
hearts
charming
,
since
it
*NL*
was
lavished
on
him
.
Then
,
sure
of
being
loved
,
he
no
longer
kept
up
*NL*
appearances
,
and
insensibly
his
ways
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
longer
,
as
formerly
,
words
so
gentle
that
they
made
her
cry
,
*NL*
nor
passionate
caresses
that
made
her
mad
,
so
that
their
great
love
,
*NL*
which
engrossed
her
life
,
seemed
to
lessen
beneath
her
like
the
water
of
*NL*
a
stream
absorbed
into
its
channel
,
and
she
could
see
the
bed
of
it
.
*NL*
She
would
not
believe
it
;
she
redoubled
in
tenderness
,
and
Rodolphe
*NL*
concealed
his
indifference
less
and
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
know
if
she
regretted
having
yielded
to
him
,
or
whether
she
*NL*
did
not
wish
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
enjoy
him
the
more
.
The
humiliation
*NL*
of
feeling
herself
weak
was
turning
to
rancour
,
tempered
by
their
*NL*
voluptuous
pleasures
.
It
was
not
affection
;
it
was
like
a
continual
*NL*
seduction
.
He
subjugated
her
;
she
almost
feared
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Appearances
,
nevertheless
,
were
calmer
than
ever
,
Rodolphe
having
*NL*
succeeded
in
carrying
out
the
adultery
after
his
own
fancy
;
and
at
the
*NL*
end
of
six
months
,
when
the
spring-time
came
,
they
were
to
one
another
*NL*
like
a
married
couple
,
tranquilly
keeping
up
a
domestic
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
time
of
year
when
old
Rouault
sent
his
turkey
in
remembrance
*NL*
of
the
setting
of
his
leg
.
The
present
always
arrived
with
a
letter
.
*NL*
Emma
cut
the
string
that
tied
it
to
the
basket
,
and
read
the
following
*NL*
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Dear
Children
--
I
hope
this
will
find
you
well
,
and
that
this
one
*NL*
will
be
as
good
as
the
others
.
For
it
seems
to
me
a
little
more
tender
,
*NL*
if
I
may
venture
to
say
so
,
and
heavier
.
But
next
time
,
for
a
change
,
*NL*
I
'll
give
you
a
turkeycock
,
unless
you
have
a
preference
for
some
dabs
;
*NL*
and
send
me
back
the
hamper
,
if
you
please
,
with
the
two
old
ones
.
I
*NL*
have
had
an
accident
with
my
cart-sheds
,
whose
covering
flew
off
one
*NL*
windy
night
among
the
trees
.
The
harvest
has
not
been
overgood
either
.
*NL*
Finally
,
I
do
n't
know
when
I
shall
come
to
see
you
.
It
is
so
difficult
*NL*
now
to
leave
the
house
since
I
am
alone
,
my
poor
Emma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
there
was
a
break
in
the
lines
,
as
if
the
old
fellow
had
dropped
*NL*
his
pen
to
dream
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
myself
,
I
am
very
well
,
except
for
a
cold
I
caught
the
other
day
at
*NL*
the
fair
at
Yvetot
,
where
I
had
gone
to
hire
a
shepherd
,
having
turned
*NL*
away
mine
because
he
was
too
dainty
.
How
we
are
to
be
pitied
with
such
*NL*
a
lot
of
thieves
!
Besides
,
he
was
also
rude
.
I
heard
from
a
pedlar
,
who
,
*NL*
travelling
through
your
part
of
the
country
this
winter
,
had
a
tooth
*NL*
drawn
,
that
Bovary
was
as
usual
working
hard
.
That
does
n't
surprise
me
;
*NL*
and
he
showed
me
his
tooth
;
we
had
some
coffee
together
.
I
asked
him
if
*NL*
he
had
seen
you
,
and
he
said
not
,
but
that
he
had
seen
two
horses
in
the
*NL*
stables
,
from
which
I
conclude
that
business
is
looking
up
.
So
much
*NL*
the
better
,
my
dear
children
,
and
may
God
send
you
every
imaginable
*NL*
happiness
!
It
grieves
me
not
yet
to
have
seen
my
dear
little
*NL*
grand-daughter
,
Berthe
Bovary
.
I
have
planted
an
Orleans
plum-tree
for
*NL*
her
in
the
garden
under
your
room
,
and
I
wo
n't
have
it
touched
unless
it
*NL*
is
to
have
jam
made
for
her
by
and
bye
,
that
I
will
keep
in
the
cupboard
*NL*
for
her
when
she
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
dear
children
.
I
kiss
you
,
my
girl
,
you
too
,
my
*NL*
son-in-law
,
and
the
little
one
on
both
cheeks
.
I
am
,
with
best
*NL*
compliments
,
your
loving
father
.

``
Theodore
Rouault

*NL*
*NL*
She
held
the
coarse
paper
in
her
fingers
for
some
minutes
.
The
spelling
*NL*
mistakes
were
interwoven
one
with
the
other
,
and
Emma
followed
the
*NL*
kindly
thought
that
cackled
right
through
it
like
a
hen
half
hidden
*NL*
in
the
hedge
of
thorns
.
The
writing
had
been
dried
with
ashes
from
*NL*
the
hearth
,
for
a
little
grey
powder
slipped
from
the
letter
on
to
her
*NL*
dress
,
and
she
almost
thought
she
saw
her
father
bending
over
the
hearth
*NL*
to
take
up
the
tongs
.
How
long
since
she
had
been
with
him
,
sitting
on
*NL*
the
footstool
in
the
chimney-corner
,
where
she
used
to
burn
the
end
of
*NL*
a
bit
of
wood
in
the
great
flame
of
the
sea-sedges
!
She
remembered
the
*NL*
summer
evenings
all
full
of
sunshine
.
The
colts
neighed
when
anyone
*NL*
passed
by
,
and
galloped
,
galloped
.
Under
her
window
there
was
a
beehive
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
the
bees
wheeling
round
in
the
light
struck
against
her
*NL*
window
like
rebounding
balls
of
gold
.
What
happiness
there
had
been
*NL*
at
that
time
,
what
freedom
,
what
hope
!
What
an
abundance
of
illusions
!
*NL*
Nothing
was
left
of
them
now
.
She
had
got
rid
of
them
all
in
her
soul
's
*NL*
life
,
in
all
her
successive
conditions
of
life
,
maidenhood
,
her
marriage
,
*NL*
and
her
love
--
thus
constantly
losing
them
all
her
life
through
,
like
*NL*
a
traveller
who
leaves
something
of
his
wealth
at
every
inn
along
his
*NL*
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
then
,
made
her
so
unhappy
?
What
was
the
extraordinary
*NL*
catastrophe
that
had
transformed
her
?
And
she
raised
her
head
,
looking
*NL*
round
as
if
to
seek
the
cause
of
that
which
made
her
suffer
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
April
ray
was
dancing
on
the
china
of
the
whatnot
;
the
fire
burned
;
*NL*
beneath
her
slippers
she
felt
the
softness
of
the
carpet
;
the
day
was
*NL*
bright
,
the
air
warm
,
and
she
heard
her
child
shouting
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
little
girl
was
just
then
rolling
on
the
lawn
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
grass
that
was
being
turned
.
She
was
lying
flat
on
her
stomach
*NL*
at
the
top
of
a
rick
.
The
servant
was
holding
her
by
her
skirt
.
*NL*
Lestiboudois
was
raking
by
her
side
,
and
every
time
he
came
near
she
*NL*
lent
forward
,
beating
the
air
with
both
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
her
to
me
,
''
said
her
mother
,
rushing
to
embrace
her
.
``
How
I
love
*NL*
you
,
my
poor
child
!
How
I
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
noticing
that
the
tips
of
her
ears
were
rather
dirty
,
she
rang
at
*NL*
once
for
warm
water
,
and
washed
her
,
changed
her
linen
,
her
stockings
,
*NL*
her
shoes
,
asked
a
thousand
questions
about
her
health
,
as
if
on
the
*NL*
return
from
a
long
journey
,
and
finally
,
kissing
her
again
and
crying
*NL*
a
little
,
she
gave
her
back
to
the
servant
,
who
stood
quite
*NL*
thunderstricken
at
this
excess
of
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Rodolphe
found
her
more
serious
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
pass
over
,
''
he
concluded
;
``
it
's
a
whim
:
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
missed
three
rendezvous
running
.
When
he
did
come
,
she
showed
*NL*
herself
cold
and
almost
contemptuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
're
losing
your
time
,
my
lady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pretended
not
to
notice
her
melancholy
sighs
,
nor
the
*NL*
handkerchief
she
took
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Emma
repented
.
She
even
asked
herself
why
she
detested
Charles
;
if
*NL*
it
had
not
been
better
to
have
been
able
to
love
him
?
But
he
gave
her
*NL*
no
opportunities
for
such
a
revival
of
sentiment
,
so
that
she
was
much
*NL*
embarrassed
by
her
desire
for
sacrifice
,
when
the
druggist
came
just
in
*NL*
time
to
provide
her
with
an
opportunity
.

He
had
recently
read
a

on

curing
club-foot

*NL*
as
he
was
a

he
conceived

he
to
Emma
,
``
what
risk
is
there
?
See

''
-LRB-
and
he
enumerated
*NL*
on
his
fingers
the
advantages
of
the
attempt
-RRB-
,
``
success
,
almost
certain
*NL*
relief
and
beautifying
of
the
patient
,
celebrity
acquired
by
the
*NL*
operator
.
Why
,
for
example
,
should
not
your
husband
relieve
poor
*NL*
Hippolyte
of
the
`
Lion
d'Or
'
?
Note
that
he
would
not
fail
to
tell
about
*NL*
his
cure
to
all
the
travellers
,
and
then
''
-LRB-
Homais
lowered
his
voice
and
*NL*
looked
round
him
-RRB-
``
who
is
to
prevent
me
from
sending
a
short
paragraph
*NL*
on
the
subject
to
the
paper
?
Eh
!
goodness
me
!
an
article
gets
about
;
it
*NL*
is
talked
of
;
it
ends
by
making
a
snowball
!
And
who
knows
?
who
knows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Bovary
might
succeed
.
Nothing
proved
to
Emma
that
he
was
not
*NL*
clever
;
and
what
a
satisfaction
for
her
to
have
urged
him
to
a
step
by
*NL*
which
his
reputation
and
fortune
would
be
increased
!
She
only
wished
to
*NL*
lean
on
something
more
solid
than
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
urged
by
the
druggist
and
by
her
,
allowed
himself
to
be
*NL*
persuaded
.
He
sent
to
Rouen
for
Dr.
Duval
's
volume
,
and
every
evening
,
*NL*
holding
his
head
between
both
hands
,
plunged
into
the
reading
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
studying
equinus
,
varus
,
and
valgus
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
katastrephopody
,
endostrephopody
,
and
exostrephopody
-LRB-
or
better
,
the
*NL*
various
turnings
of
the
foot
downwards
,
inwards
,
and
outwards
,
with
the
*NL*
hypostrephopody
and
anastrephopody
-RRB-
,
otherwise
torsion
downwards
and
*NL*
upwards
,
Monsier
Homais
,
with
all
sorts
of
arguments
,
was
exhorting
the
*NL*
lad
at
the
inn
to
submit
to
the
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
scarcely
feel
,
probably
,
a
slight
pain
;
it
is
a
simple
prick
,
*NL*
like
a
little
blood-letting
,
less
than
the
extraction
of
certain
corns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
reflecting
,
rolled
his
stupid
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
''
continued
the
chemist
,
``
it
does
n't
concern
me
.
It
's
for
your
*NL*
sake
,
for
pure
humanity
!
I
should
like
to
see
you
,
my
friend
,
rid
of
*NL*
your
hideous
caudication
,
together
with
that
waddling
of
the
lumbar
*NL*
regions
which
,
whatever
you
say
,
must
considerably
interfere
with
you
in
*NL*
the
exercise
of
your
calling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Homais
represented
to
him
how
much
jollier
and
brisker
he
would
*NL*
feel
afterwards
,
and
even
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
would
be
more
*NL*
likely
to
please
the
women
;
and
the
stable-boy
began
to
smile
heavily
.
*NL*
Then
he
attacked
him
through
his
vanity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
a
man
?
Hang
it
!
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
had
to
*NL*
go
into
the
army
,
to
go
and
fight
beneath
the
standard
?
Ah
!
Hippolyte
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Homais
retired
,
declaring
that
he
could
not
understand
this
*NL*
obstinacy
,
this
blindness
in
refusing
the
benefactions
of
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
gave
way
,
for
it
was
like
a
conspiracy
.
Binet
,
who
never
*NL*
interfered
with
other
people
's
business
,
Madame
Lefrancois
,
Artemise
,
*NL*
the
neighbours
,
even
the
mayor
,
Monsieur
Tuvache
--
everyone
persuaded
*NL*
him
,
lectured
him
,
shamed
him
;
but
what
finally
decided
him
was
that
it
*NL*
would
cost
him
nothing
.
Bovary
even
undertook
to
provide
the
machine
*NL*
for
the
operation
.
This
generosity
was
an
idea
of
Emma
's
,
and
Charles
*NL*
consented
to
it
,
thinking
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
his
wife
was
an
*NL*
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
by
the
advice
of
the
chemist
,
and
after
three
fresh
starts
,
he
had
a
*NL*
kind
of
box
made
by
the
carpenter
,
with
the
aid
of
the
locksmith
,
*NL*
that
weighed
about
eight
pounds
,
and
in
which
iron
,
wood
,
sheer-iron
,
*NL*
leather
,
screws
,
and
nuts
had
not
been
spared
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
know
which
of
Hippolyte
's
tendons
to
cut
,
it
was
necessary
first
*NL*
of
all
to
find
out
what
kind
of
club-foot
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
foot
forming
almost
a
straight
line
with
the
leg
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
did
not
prevent
it
from
being
turned
in
,
so
that
it
was
an
*NL*
equinus
together
with
something
of
a
varus
,
or
else
a
slight
varus
with
*NL*
a
strong
tendency
to
equinus
.
But
with
this
equinus
,
wide
in
foot
like
*NL*
a
horse
's
hoof
,
with
rugose
skin
,
dry
tendons
,
and
large
toes
,
on
which
*NL*
the
black
nails
looked
as
if
made
of
iron
,
the
clubfoot
ran
about
like
*NL*
a
deer
from
morn
till
night
.
He
was
constantly
to
be
seen
on
the
Place
,
*NL*
jumping
round
the
carts
,
thrusting
his
limping
foot
forwards
.
He
seemed
*NL*
even
stronger
on
that
leg
than
the
other
.
By
dint
of
hard
service
it
had
*NL*
acquired
,
as
it
were
,
moral
qualities
of
patience
and
energy
;
and
*NL*
when
he
was
given
some
heavy
work
,
he
stood
on
it
in
preference
to
its
*NL*
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
it
was
an
equinus
,
it
was
necessary
to
cut
the
tendon
of
*NL*
Achilles
,
and
,
if
need
were
,
the
anterior
tibial
muscle
could
be
seen
to
*NL*
afterwards
for
getting
rid
of
the
varus
;
for
the
doctor
did
not
dare
to
*NL*
risk
both
operations
at
once
;
he
was
even
trembling
already
for
fear
of
*NL*
injuring
some
important
region
that
he
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Ambrose
Pare
,
applying
for
the
first
time
since
Celsus
,
after
an
*NL*
interval
of
fifteen
centuries
,
a
ligature
to
an
artery
,
nor
Dupuytren
,
*NL*
about
to
open
an
abscess
in
the
brain
,
nor
Gensoul
when
he
first
took
*NL*
away
the
superior
maxilla
,
had
hearts
that
trembled
,
hands
that
shook
,
*NL*
minds
so
strained
as
Monsieur
Bovary
when
he
approached
Hippolyte
,
his
*NL*
tenotome
between
his
fingers
.
And
as
at
hospitals
,
near
by
on
a
table
*NL*
lay
a
heap
of
lint
,
with
waxed
thread
,
many
bandages
--
a
pyramid
of
*NL*
bandages
--
every
bandage
to
be
found
at
the
druggist
's
.
It
was
Monsieur
*NL*
Homais
who
since
morning
had
been
organising
all
these
preparations
,
*NL*
as
much
to
dazzle
the
multitude
as
to
keep
up
his
illusions
.
Charles
*NL*
pierced
the
skin
;
a
dry
crackling
was
heard
.
The
tendon
was
cut
,
the
*NL*
operation
over
.
Hippolyte
could
not
get
over
his
surprise
,
but
bent
over
*NL*
Bovary
's
hands
to
cover
them
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
be
calm
,
''
said
the
druggist
;
``
later
on
you
will
show
your
*NL*
gratitude
to
your
benefactor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
down
to
tell
the
result
to
five
or
six
inquirers
who
were
*NL*
waiting
in
the
yard
,
and
who
fancied
that
Hippolyte
would
reappear
*NL*
walking
properly
.
Then
Charles
,
having
buckled
his
patient
into
the
*NL*
machine
,
went
home
,
where
Emma
,
all
anxiety
,
awaited
him
at
the
door
.
*NL*
She
threw
herself
on
his
neck
;
they
sat
down
to
table
;
he
ate
much
,
*NL*
and
at
dessert
he
even
wanted
to
take
a
cup
of
coffee
,
a
luxury
he
only
*NL*
permitted
himself
on
Sundays
when
there
was
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
charming
,
full
of
prattle
,
of
dreams
together
.
They
*NL*
talked
about
their
future
fortune
,
of
the
improvements
to
be
made
in
*NL*
their
house
;
he
saw
people
's
estimation
of
him
growing
,
his
comforts
*NL*
increasing
,
his
wife
always
loving
him
;
and
she
was
happy
to
refresh
*NL*
herself
with
a
new
sentiment
,
healthier
,
better
,
to
feel
at
last
some
*NL*
tenderness
for
this
poor
fellow
who
adored
her
.
The
thought
of
Rodolphe
*NL*
for
one
moment
passed
through
her
mind
,
but
her
eyes
turned
again
to
*NL*
Charles
;
she
even
noticed
with
surprise
that
he
had
not
bad
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
bed
when
Monsieur
Homais
,
in
spite
of
the
servant
,
suddenly
*NL*
entered
the
room
,
holding
in
his
hand
a
sheet
of
paper
just
written
.
It
*NL*
was
the
paragraph
he
intended
for
the
``
Fanal
de
Rouen
.
''
He
brought
it
*NL*
for
them
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
it
yourself
,
''
said
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Despite
the
prejudices
that
still
invest
a
part
of
the
face
of
Europe
*NL*
like
a
net
,
the
light
nevertheless
begins
to
penetrate
our
country
*NL*
places
.
Thus
on
Tuesday
our
little
town
of
Yonville
found
itself
the
*NL*
scene
of
a
surgical
operation
which
is
at
the
same
time
an
act
of
*NL*
loftiest
philanthropy
.

Bovary

of
our
most
distinguished
*NL*
practitioners

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that

Charles

choking
with
emotion

``

Performed

``

``

''
said
the

.
''
`
Monsieur
Bovary
,
one
of
our
most
*NL*
distinguished
practitioners
,
performed
an
operation
on
a
club-footed
man
*NL*
called
Hippolyte
Tautain
,
stableman
for
the
last
twenty-five
years
at
*NL*
the
hotel
of
the
``
Lion
d'Or
,
''
kept
by
Widow
Lefrancois
,
at
the
Place
*NL*
d'Armes
.
The
novelty
of
the
attempt
,
and
the
interest
incident
to
the
*NL*
subject
,
had
attracted
such
a
concourse
of
persons
that
there
was
*NL*
a
veritable
obstruction
on
the
threshold
of
the
establishment
.
The
*NL*
operation
,
moreover
,
was
performed
as
if
by
magic
,
and
barely
a
*NL*
few
drops
of
blood
appeared
on
the
skin
,
as
though
to
say
that
the
*NL*
rebellious
tendon
had
at
last
given
way
beneath
the
efforts
of
art
.
The
*NL*
patient
,
strangely
enough
--
we
affirm
it
as
an
eye-witness
--
complained
*NL*
of
no
pain
.
His
condition
up
to
the
present
time
leaves
nothing
to
be
*NL*
desired
.
Everything
tends
to
show
that
his
convelescence
will
be
brief
;
*NL*
and
who
knows
even
if
at
our
next
village
festivity
we
shall
not
see
our
*NL*
good
Hippolyte
figuring
in
the
bacchic
dance
in
the
midst
of
a
chorus
*NL*
of
joyous
boon-companions
,
and
thus
proving
to
all
eyes
by
his
verve
*NL*
and
his
capers
his
complete
cure
?
Honour
,
then
,
to
the
generous
savants
!
*NL*
Honour
to
those
indefatigable
spirits
who
consecrate
their
vigils
to
the
*NL*
amelioration
or
to
the
alleviation
of
their
kind
!
Honour
,
thrice
honour
!

Is
it
not
time
to
cry
that
the
blind
shall
see
,
the
deaf
hear
,
the
lame
*NL*
walk
?
But
that
which
fanaticism
formerly
promised
to
its
elect
,
science
*NL*
now
accomplishes
for
all
men
.
We
shall
keep
our
readers
informed
as
to
*NL*
the
successive
phases
of
this
remarkable
cure

*NL*
*NL*
This
did
not
prevent
Mere
Lefrancois
,
from
coming
five
days
after
,
*NL*
scared
,
and
crying
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
he
is
dying
!
I
am
going
crazy

*NL*
*NL*
Charles
rushed
to
the
``
Lion
d'Or
,
''
and
the
chemist
,
who
caught
sight
*NL*
of
him
passing
along
the
Place
hatless
,
abandoned
his
shop
.
He
appeared
*NL*
himself
breathless
,
red
,
anxious
,
and
asking
everyone
who
was
going
up
*NL*
the
stairs
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
our
interesting
strephopode
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strephopode
was
writhing
in
hideous
convulsions
,
so
that
the
machine
*NL*
in
which
his
leg
was
enclosed
was
knocked
against
the
wall
enough
to
*NL*
break
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
many
precautions
,
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
position
of
the
limb
,
*NL*
the
box
was
removed
,
and
an
awful
sight
presented
itself
.
The
outlines
*NL*
of
the
foot
disappeared
in
such
a
swelling
that
the
entire
skin
seemed
*NL*
about
to
burst
,
and
it
was
covered
with
ecchymosis
,
caused
by
the
famous
*NL*
machine
.
Hippolyte
had
already
complained
of
suffering
from
it
.
No
*NL*
attention
had
been
paid
to
him
;
they
had
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
not
*NL*
been
altogether
wrong
,
and
he
was
freed
for
a
few
hours
.
But
,
hardly
had
*NL*
the
oedema
gone
down
to
some
extent
,
than
the
two
savants
thought
fit
*NL*
to
put
back
the
limb
in
the
apparatus
,
strapping
it
tighter
to
hasten
*NL*
matters
.
At
last
,
three
days
after
,
Hippolyte
being
unable
to
endure
it
*NL*
any
longer
,
they
once
more
removed
the
machine
,
and
were
much
surprised
*NL*
at
the
result
they
saw
.
The
livid
tumefaction
spread
over
the
leg
,
with
*NL*
blisters
here
and
there
,
whence
there
oozed
a
black
liquid
.
Matters
*NL*
were
taking
a
serious
turn
.
Hippolyte
began
to
worry
himself
,
and
Mere
*NL*
Lefrancois
,
had
him
installed
in
the
little
room
near
the
kitchen
,
so
*NL*
that
he
might
at
least
have
some
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tax-collector
,
who
dined
there
every
day
,
complained
bitterly
of
*NL*
such
companionship
.
Then
Hippolyte
was
removed
to
the
billiard-room
.
*NL*
He
lay
there
moaning
under
his
heavy
coverings
,
pale
with
long
beard
,
*NL*
sunken
eyes
,
and
from
time
to
time
turning
his
perspiring
head
on
the
*NL*
dirty
pillow
,
where
the
flies
alighted
.
Madame
Bovary
went
to
see
him
.
*NL*
She
brought
him
linen
for
his
poultices
;
she
comforted
,
and
encouraged
*NL*
him
.
Besides
,
he
did
not
want
for
company
,
especially
on
market-days
,
*NL*
when
the
peasants
were
knocking
about
the
billiard-balls
round
him
,
*NL*
fenced
with
the
cues
,
smoked
,
drank
,
sang
,
and
brawled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
?
''
they
said
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
.
``
Ah
!
you
're
not
*NL*
up
to
much
,
it
seems
,
but
it
's
your
own
fault
.
You
should
do
this
!
do
*NL*
that
!
''
And
then
they
told
him
stories
of
people
who
had
all
been
cured
*NL*
by
other
remedies
than
his
.
Then
by
way
of
consolation
they
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give
way
too
much
!
Get
up
!
You
coddle
yourself
like
a
king
!
All
the
*NL*
same
,
old
chap
,
you
do
n't
smell
nice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gangrene
,
in
fact
,
was
spreading
more
and
more
.
Bovary
himself
turned
*NL*
sick
at
it
.
He
came
every
hour
,
every
moment
.
Hippolyte
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
eyes
full
of
terror
,
sobbing
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
shall
I
get
well
?
Oh
,
save
me
!
How
unfortunate
I
am
!
How
*NL*
unfortunate
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
doctor
left
,
always
recommending
him
to
diet
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
listen
to
him
,
my
lad
,
''
said
Mere
Lefrancois
,
``
Have
n't
they
*NL*
tortured
you
enough
already
?
You
'll
grow
still
weaker
.
Here
!
swallow
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
gave
him
some
good
beef-tea
,
a
slice
of
mutton
,
a
piece
of
*NL*
bacon
,
and
sometimes
small
glasses
of
brandy
,
that
he
had
not
the
*NL*
strength
to
put
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Abbe
Bournisien
,
hearing
that
he
was
growing
worse
,
asked
to
see
him
.
*NL*
He
began
by
pitying
his
sufferings
,
declaring
at
the
same
time
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
rejoice
at
them
since
it
was
the
will
of
the
Lord
,
and
take
*NL*
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
reconcile
himself
to
Heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
,
''
said
the
ecclesiastic
in
a
paternal
tone
,
``
you
rather
neglected
*NL*
your
duties
;
you
were
rarely
seen
at
divine
worship
.
How
many
years
is
*NL*
it
since
you
approached
the
holy
table
?
I
understand
that
your
work
,
*NL*
that
the
whirl
of
the
world
may
have
kept
you
from
care
for
your
*NL*
salvation
.
But
now
is
the
time
to
reflect
.
Yet
do
n't
despair
.
I
have
*NL*
known
great
sinners
,
who
,
about
to
appear
before
God
-LRB-
you
are
not
yet
*NL*
at
this
point
I
know
-RRB-
,
had
implored
His
mercy
,
and
who
certainly
died
in
*NL*
the
best
frame
of
mind
.
Let
us
hope
that
,
like
them
,
you
will
set
us
a
*NL*
good
example
.
Thus
,
as
a
precaution
,
what
is
to
prevent
you
from
saying
*NL*
morning
and
evening
a
`
Hail
Mary
,
full
of
grace
,
'
and
`
Our
Father
which
*NL*
art
in
heaven
'
?
Yes
,
do
that
,
for
my
sake
,
to
oblige
me
.
That
wo
n't
cost
*NL*
you
anything
.
Will
you
promise
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
devil
promised
.
The
cure
came
back
day
after
day
.
He
chatted
*NL*
with
the
landlady
;
and
even
told
anecdotes
interspersed
with
jokes
and
*NL*
puns
that
Hippolyte
did
not
understand
.
Then
,
as
soon
as
he
could
,
he
*NL*
fell
back
upon
matters
of
religion
,
putting
on
an
appropriate
expression
*NL*
of
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
zeal
seemed
successful
,
for
the
club-foot
soon
manifested
a
desire
*NL*
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Bon-Secours
if
he
were
cured
;
to
which
Monsieur
*NL*
Bournisien
replied
that
he
saw
no
objection
;
two
precautions
were
better
*NL*
than
one
;
it
was
no
risk
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
was
indignant
at
what
he
called
the
manoeuvres
of
the
*NL*
priest
;
they
were
prejudicial
,
he
said
,
to
Hippolyte
's
convalescence
,
*NL*
and
he
kept
repeating
to
Madame
Lefrancois
,
``
Leave
him
alone
!
leave
him
*NL*
alone
!
You
perturb
his
morals
with
your
mysticism
.
''
But
the
good
woman
*NL*
would
no
longer
listen
to
him
;
he
was
the
cause
of
it
all
.
From
a
spirit
*NL*
of
contradiction
she
hung
up
near
the
bedside
of
the
patient
a
basin
*NL*
filled
with
holy-water
and
a
branch
of
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Religion
,
however
,
seemed
no
more
able
to
succour
him
than
surgery
,
and
*NL*
the
invincible
gangrene
still
spread
from
the
extremities
towards
*NL*
the
stomach
.
It
was
all
very
well
to
vary
the
potions
and
change
the
*NL*
poultices
;
the
muscles
each
day
rotted
more
and
more
;
and
at
last
*NL*
Charles
replied
by
an
affirmative
nod
of
the
head
when
Mere
Lefrancois
,
*NL*
asked
him
if
she
could
not
,
as
a
forlorn
hope
,
send
for
Monsieur
Canivet
*NL*
of
Neufchatel
,
who
was
a
celebrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
doctor
of
medicine
,
fifty
years
of
age
,
enjoying
a
good
position
*NL*
and
self-possessed
,
Charles
's
colleague
did
not
refrain
from
laughing
*NL*
disdainfully
when
he
had
uncovered
the
leg
,
mortified
to
the
knee
.
Then
*NL*
having
flatly
declared
that
it
must
be
amputated
,
he
went
off
to
the
*NL*
chemist
's
to
rail
at
the
asses
who
could
have
reduced
a
poor
man
to
such
*NL*
a
state
.
Shaking
Monsieur
Homais
by
the
button
of
his
coat
,
he
shouted
*NL*
out
in
the
shop
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
the
inventions
of
Paris
!
These
are
the
ideas
of
those
gentry
*NL*
of
the
capital
!
It
is
like
strabismus
,
chloroform
,
lithotrity
,
a
heap
of
*NL*
monstrosities
that
the
Government
ought
to
prohibit
.
But
they
want
to
do
*NL*
the
clever
,
and
they
cram
you
with
remedies
without
,
troubling
about
*NL*
the
consequences
.
We
are
not
so
clever
,
not
we
!
We
are
not
savants
,
*NL*
coxcombs
,
fops
!
We
are
practitioners
;
we
cure
people
,
and
we
should
*NL*
not
dream
of
operating
on
anyone
who
is
in
perfect
health
.
Straighten
*NL*
club-feet
!
As
if
one
could
straighten
club-feet
!
It
is
as
if
one
wished
,
*NL*
for
example
,
to
make
a
hunchback
straight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
suffered
as
he
listened
to
this
discourse
,
and
he
concealed
his
*NL*
discomfort
beneath
a
courtier
's
smile
;
for
he
needed
to
humour
Monsier
*NL*
Canivet
,
whose
prescriptions
sometimes
came
as
far
as
Yonville
.
So
he
*NL*
did
not
take
up
the
defence
of
Bovary
;
he
did
not
even
make
a
single
*NL*
remark
,
and
,
renouncing
his
principles
,
he
sacrificed
his
dignity
to
the
*NL*
more
serious
interests
of
his
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
amputation
of
the
thigh
by
Doctor
Canivet
was
a
great
event
in
the
*NL*
village
.
On
that
day
all
the
inhabitants
got
up
earlier
,
and
the
Grande
*NL*
Rue
,
although
full
of
people
,
had
something
lugubrious
about
it
,
as
*NL*
if
an
execution
had
been
expected
.
At
the
grocer
's
they
discussed
*NL*
Hippolyte
's
illness
;
the
shops
did
no
business
,
and
Madame
Tuvache
,
the
*NL*
mayor
's
wife
,
did
not
stir
from
her
window
,
such
was
her
impatience
to
*NL*
see
the
operator
arrive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
in
his
gig
,
which
he
drove
himself
.
But
the
springs
of
the
right
*NL*
side
having
at
length
given
way
beneath
the
weight
of
his
corpulence
,
it
*NL*
happened
that
the
carriage
as
it
rolled
along
leaned
over
a
little
,
and
*NL*
on
the
other
cushion
near
him
could
be
seen
a
large
box
covered
in
red
*NL*
sheep-leather
,
whose
three
brass
clasps
shone
grandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
entered
like
a
whirlwind
the
porch
of
the
``
Lion
d'Or
,
''
the
*NL*
doctor
,
shouting
very
loud
,
ordered
them
to
unharness
his
horse
.
Then
he
*NL*
went
into
the
stable
to
see
that
she
was
eating
her
oats
all
right
;
for
*NL*
on
arriving
at
a
patient
's
he
first
of
all
looked
after
his
mare
and
his
*NL*
gig
.
People
even
said
about
this
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Monsieur
Canivet
's
a
character
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
the
more
esteemed
for
this
imperturbable
coolness
.
The
*NL*
universe
to
the
last
man
might
have
died
,
and
he
would
not
have
missed
*NL*
the
smallest
of
his
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
presented
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
count
on
you
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
Are
we
ready
?
Come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
druggist
,
turning
red
,
confessed
that
he
was
too
sensitive
to
*NL*
assist
at
such
an
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
one
is
a
simple
spectator
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
imagination
,
you
know
,
*NL*
is
impressed
.
And
then
I
have
such
a
nervous
system
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
''
interrupted
Canivet
;
``
on
the
contrary
,
you
seem
to
me
inclined
*NL*
to
apoplexy
.
Besides
,
that
does
n't
astonish
me
,
for
you
chemist
fellows
*NL*
are
always
poking
about
your
kitchens
,
which
must
end
by
spoiling
your
*NL*
constitutions
.
Now
just
look
at
me
.
I
get
up
every
day
at
four
o'clock
;
*NL*
I
shave
with
cold
water
-LRB-
and
am
never
cold
-RRB-
.
I
do
n't
wear
flannels
,
and
*NL*
I
never
catch
cold
;
my
carcass
is
good
enough
!
I
live
now
in
one
way
,
*NL*
now
in
another
,
like
a
philosopher
,
taking
pot-luck
;
that
is
why
I
*NL*
am
not
squeamish
like
you
,
and
it
is
as
indifferent
to
me
to
carve
a
*NL*
Christian
as
the
first
fowl
that
turns
up
.
Then
,
perhaps
,
you
will
say
,
*NL*
habit
!
habit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
without
any
consideration
for
Hippolyte
,
who
was
sweating
with
*NL*
agony
between
his
sheets
,
these
gentlemen
entered
into
a
conversation
,
*NL*
in
which
the
druggist
compared
the
coolness
of
a
surgeon
to
that
of
a
*NL*
general
;
and
this
comparison
was
pleasing
to
Canivet
,
who
launched
out
*NL*
on
the
exigencies
of
his
art
.
He
looked
upon
,
it
as
a
sacred
office
,
*NL*
although
the
ordinary
practitioners
dishonoured
it
.
At
last
,
coming
back
*NL*
to
the
patient
,
he
examined
the
bandages
brought
by
Homais
,
the
same
*NL*
that
had
appeared
for
the
club-foot
,
and
asked
for
someone
to
hold
the
*NL*
limb
for
him
.
Lestiboudois
was
sent
for
,
and
Monsieur
Canivet
having
*NL*
turned
up
his
sleeves
,
passed
into
the
billiard-room
,
while
the
druggist
*NL*
stayed
with
Artemise
and
the
landlady
,
both
whiter
than
their
aprons
,
*NL*
and
with
ears
strained
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bovary
during
this
time
did
not
dare
to
stir
from
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
downstairs
in
the
sitting-room
by
the
side
of
the
fireless
*NL*
chimney
,
his
chin
on
his
breast
,
his
hands
clasped
,
his
eyes
staring
.
*NL*
``
What
a
mishap
!
''
he
thought
,
``
what
a
mishap
!
''
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
had
*NL*
made
some
slip
.
He
thought
it
over
,
but
could
hit
upon
nothing
.
But
the
*NL*
most
famous
surgeons
also
made
mistakes
;
and
that
is
what
no
one
would
*NL*
ever
believe
!
People
,
on
the
contrary
,
would
laugh
,
jeer
!
It
would
*NL*
spread
as
far
as
Forges
,
as
Neufchatel
,
as
Rouen
,
everywhere
!
Who
could
*NL*
say
if
his
colleagues
would
not
write
against
him
.
Polemics
would
ensue
;
*NL*
he
would
have
to
answer
in
the
papers
.
Hippolyte
might
even
prosecute
*NL*
him
.
He
saw
himself
dishonoured
,
ruined
,
lost
;
and
his
imagination
,
*NL*
assailed
by
a
world
of
hypotheses
,
tossed
amongst
them
like
an
empty
*NL*
cask
borne
by
the
sea
and
floating
upon
the
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
opposite
,
watched
him
;
she
did
not
share
his
humiliation
;
she
felt
*NL*
another
--
that
of
having
supposed
such
a
man
was
worth
anything
.
As
if
*NL*
twenty
times
already
she
had
not
sufficiently
perceived
his
mediocrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
;
his
boots
creaked
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
fidget
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
it
that
she
--
she
,
who
was
so
intelligent
--
could
have
allowed
*NL*
herself
to
be
deceived
again
?
and
through
what
deplorable
madness
had
*NL*
she
thus
ruined
her
life
by
continual
sacrifices
?
She
recalled
all
her
*NL*
instincts
of
luxury
,
all
the
privations
of
her
soul
,
the
sordidness
of
*NL*
marriage
,
of
the
household
,
her
dream
sinking
into
the
mire
like
wounded
*NL*
swallows
;
all
that
she
had
longed
for
,
all
that
she
had
denied
herself
,
*NL*
all
that
she
might
have
had
!
And
for
what
?
for
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
silence
that
hung
over
the
village
a
heart-rending
*NL*
cry
rose
on
the
air
.
Bovary
turned
white
to
fainting
.
She
knit
her
*NL*
brows
with
a
nervous
gesture
,
then
went
on
.
And
it
was
for
him
,
for
this
*NL*
creature
,
for
this
man
,
who
understood
nothing
,
who
felt
nothing
!
For
he
*NL*
was
there
quite
quiet
,
not
even
suspecting
that
the
ridicule
of
his
name
*NL*
would
henceforth
sully
hers
as
well
as
his
.
She
had
made
efforts
to
love
*NL*
him
,
and
she
had
repented
with
tears
for
having
yielded
to
another
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
perhaps
a
valgus
!
''
suddenly
exclaimed
Bovary
,
who
was
*NL*
meditating
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
unexpected
shock
of
this
phrase
falling
on
her
thought
like
a
*NL*
leaden
bullet
on
a
silver
plate
,
Emma
,
shuddering
,
raised
her
head
in
*NL*
order
to
find
out
what
he
meant
to
say
;
and
they
looked
at
the
other
in
*NL*
silence
,
almost
amazed
to
see
each
other
,
so
far
sundered
were
they
*NL*
by
their
inner
thoughts
.
Charles
gazed
at
her
with
the
dull
look
of
*NL*
a
drunken
man
,
while
he
listened
motionless
to
the
last
cries
of
the
*NL*
sufferer
,
that
followed
each
other
in
long-drawn
modulations
,
broken
by
*NL*
sharp
spasms
like
the
far-off
howling
of
some
beast
being
slaughtered
.
*NL*
Emma
bit
her
wan
lips
,
and
rolling
between
her
fingers
a
piece
of
coral
*NL*
that
she
had
broken
,
fixed
on
Charles
the
burning
glance
of
her
eyes
*NL*
like
two
arrows
of
fire
about
to
dart
forth
.
Everything
in
him
irritated
*NL*
her
now
;
his
face
,
his
dress
,
what
he
did
not
say
,
his
whole
person
,
his
*NL*
existence
,
in
fine
.
She
repented
of
her
past
virtue
as
of
a
crime
,
and
*NL*
what
still
remained
of
it
rumbled
away
beneath
the
furious
blows
of
her
*NL*
pride
.
She
revelled
in
all
the
evil
ironies
of
triumphant
adultery
.
*NL*
The
memory
of
her
lover
came
back
to
her
with
dazzling
attractions
;
she
*NL*
threw
her
whole
soul
into
it
,
borne
away
towards
this
image
with
a
fresh
*NL*
enthusiasm
;
and
Charles
seemed
to
her
as
much
removed
from
her
life
,
as
*NL*
absent
forever
,
as
impossible
and
annihilated
,
as
if
he
had
been
about
*NL*
to
die
and
were
passing
under
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sound
of
steps
on
the
pavement
.
Charles
looked
up
,
and
*NL*
through
the
lowered
blinds
he
saw
at
the
corner
of
the
market
in
*NL*
the
broad
sunshine
Dr.
Canivet
,
who
was
wiping
his
brow
with
his
*NL*
handkerchief
.
Homais
,
behind
him
,
was
carrying
a
large
red
box
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
both
were
going
towards
the
chemist
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
with
a
feeling
of
sudden
tenderness
and
discouragement
Charles
*NL*
turned
to
his
wife
saying
to
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
kiss
me
,
my
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
!
''
she
said
,
red
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
asked
,
stupefied
.
``
Be
calm
;
compose
yourself
.
*NL*
You
know
well
enough
that
I
love
you
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
''
she
cried
with
a
terrible
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
escaping
from
the
room
,
Emma
closed
the
door
so
violently
that
the
*NL*
barometer
fell
from
the
wall
and
smashed
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
sank
back
into
his
arm-chair
overwhelmed
,
trying
to
discover
*NL*
what
could
be
wrong
with
her
,
fancying
some
nervous
illness
,
weeping
,
*NL*
and
vaguely
feeling
something
fatal
and
incomprehensible
whirling
round
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rodolphe
came
to
the
garden
that
evening
,
he
found
his
mistress
*NL*
waiting
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
on
the
lowest
stair
.
They
threw
*NL*
their
arms
round
one
another
,
and
all
their
rancour
melted
like
snow
*NL*
beneath
the
warmth
of
that
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Twelve
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
love
one
another
again
.
Often
,
even
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
day
,
Emma
suddenly
wrote
to
him
,
then
from
the
window
made
a
sign
to
*NL*
Justin
,
who
,
taking
his
apron
off
,
quickly
ran
to
La
Huchette
.
Rodolphe
*NL*
would
come
;
she
had
sent
for
him
to
tell
him
that
she
was
bored
,
that
*NL*
her
husband
was
odious
,
her
life
frightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
can
I
do
?
''
he
cried
one
day
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
if
you
would
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
on
the
floor
between
his
knees
,
her
hair
loose
,
her
look
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
?
''
said
Rodolphe
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
would
go
and
live
elsewhere
--
somewhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
really
mad
!
''
he
said
laughing
.
``
How
could
that
be
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
to
the
subject
;
he
pretended
not
to
understand
,
and
turned
*NL*
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
did
not
understand
was
all
this
worry
about
so
simple
an
affair
*NL*
as
love
.
She
had
a
motive
,
a
reason
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
a
pendant
to
her
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tenderness
,
in
fact
,
grew
each
day
with
her
repulsion
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
The
more
she
gave
up
herself
to
the
one
,
the
more
she
loathed
*NL*
the
other
.
Never
had
Charles
seemed
to
her
so
disagreeable
,
to
have
*NL*
such
stodgy
fingers
,
such
vulgar
ways
,
to
be
so
dull
as
when
they
found
*NL*
themselves
together
after
her
meeting
with
Rodolphe
.
Then
,
while
playing
*NL*
the
spouse
and
virtue
,
she
was
burning
at
the
thought
of
that
head
whose
*NL*
black
hair
fell
in
a
curl
over
the
sunburnt
brow
,
of
that
form
at
once
*NL*
so
strong
and
elegant
,
of
that
man
,
in
a
word
,
who
had
such
experience
*NL*
in
his
reasoning
,
such
passion
in
his
desires
.
It
was
for
him
that
she
*NL*
filed
her
nails
with
the
care
of
a
chaser
,
and
that
there
was
never
*NL*
enough
cold-cream
for
her
skin
,
nor
of
patchouli
for
her
handkerchiefs
.
*NL*
She
loaded
herself
with
bracelets
,
rings
,
and
necklaces
.
When
he
*NL*
was
coming
she
filled
the
two
large
blue
glass
vases
with
roses
,
and
*NL*
prepared
her
room
and
her
person
like
a
courtesan
expecting
a
prince
.
*NL*
The
servant
had
to
be
constantly
washing
linen
,
and
all
day
Felicite
*NL*
did
not
stir
from
the
kitchen
,
where
little
Justin
,
who
often
kept
her
*NL*
company
,
watched
her
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
elbows
on
the
long
board
on
which
she
was
ironing
,
he
*NL*
greedily
watched
all
these
women
's
clothes
spread
about
him
,
the
dimity
*NL*
petticoats
,
the
fichus
,
the
collars
,
and
the
drawers
with
running
*NL*
strings
,
wide
at
the
hips
and
growing
narrower
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
for
?
''
asked
the
young
fellow
,
passing
his
hand
over
the
*NL*
crinoline
or
the
hooks
and
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
have
n't
you
ever
seen
anything
?
''
Felicite
answered
laughing
.
``
As
*NL*
if
your
mistress
,
Madame
Homais
,
did
n't
wear
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
daresay
!
Madame
Homais
!
''
And
he
added
with
a
meditative
air
,
``
As
*NL*
if
she
were
a
lady
like
madame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Felicite
grew
impatient
of
seeing
him
hanging
round
her
.
She
was
six
*NL*
years
older
than
he
,
and
Theodore
,
Monsieur
Guillaumin
's
servant
,
was
*NL*
beginning
to
pay
court
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
,
''
she
said
,
moving
her
pot
of
starch
.
``
You
'd
better
be
*NL*
off
and
pound
almonds
;
you
are
always
dangling
about
women
.
Before
you
*NL*
meddle
with
such
things
,
bad
boy
,
wait
till
you
've
got
a
beard
to
your
*NL*
chin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
cross
!
I
'll
go
and
clean
her
boots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
at
once
took
down
from
the
shelf
Emma
's
boots
,
all
coated
with
*NL*
mud
,
the
mud
of
the
rendezvous
,
that
crumbled
into
powder
beneath
his
*NL*
fingers
,
and
that
he
watched
as
it
gently
rose
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
afraid
you
are
of
spoiling
them
!
''
said
the
servant
,
who
was
n't
so
*NL*
particular
when
she
cleaned
them
herself
,
because
as
soon
as
the
stuff
*NL*
of
the
boots
was
no
longer
fresh
madame
handed
them
over
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
had
a
number
in
her
cupboard
that
she
squandered
one
after
the
*NL*
other
,
without
Charles
allowing
himself
the
slightest
observation
.
So
*NL*
also
he
disbursed
three
hundred
francs
for
a
wooden
leg
that
she
thought
*NL*
proper
to
make
a
present
of
to
Hippolyte
.
Its
top
was
covered
with
cork
,
*NL*
and
it
had
spring
joints
,
a
complicated
mechanism
,
covered
over
by
black
*NL*
trousers
ending
in
a
patent-leather
boot
.
But
Hippolyte
,
not
daring
*NL*
to
use
such
a
handsome
leg
every
day
,
begged
Madame
Bovary
to
get
him
*NL*
another
more
convenient
one
.
The
doctor
,
of
course
,
had
again
to
defray
*NL*
the
expense
of
this
purchase
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
little
by
little
the
stable-man
took
up
his
work
again
.
One
saw
him
*NL*
running
about
the
village
as
before
,
and
when
Charles
heard
from
afar
*NL*
the
sharp
noise
of
the
wooden
leg
,
he
at
once
went
in
another
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
the
shopkeeper
,
who
had
undertaken
the
order
;
*NL*
this
provided
him
with
an
excuse
for
visiting
Emma
.
He
chatted
with
her
*NL*
about
the
new
goods
from
Paris
,
about
a
thousand
feminine
trifles
,
made
*NL*
himself
very
obliging
,
and
never
asked
for
his
money
.
Emma
yielded
to
*NL*
this
lazy
mode
of
satisfying
all
her
caprices
.
Thus
she
wanted
to
have
*NL*
a
very
handsome
ridding-whip
that
was
at
an
umbrella-maker
's
at
Rouen
*NL*
to
give
to
Rodolphe
.
The
week
after
Monsieur
Lheureux
placed
it
on
her
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
day
he
called
on
her
with
a
bill
for
two
hundred
and
*NL*
seventy
francs
,
not
counting
the
centimes
.
Emma
was
much
embarrassed
;
*NL*
all
the
drawers
of
the
writing-table
were
empty
;
they
owed
over
a
*NL*
fortnight
's
wages
to
Lestiboudois
,
two
quarters
to
the
servant
,
for
any
*NL*
quantity
of
other
things
,
and
Bovary
was
impatiently
expecting
Monsieur
*NL*
Derozeray
's
account
,
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
paying
every
year
*NL*
about
Midsummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
succeeded
at
first
in
putting
off
Lheureux
.
At
last
he
lost
*NL*
patience
;
he
was
being
sued
;
his
capital
was
out
,
and
unless
he
got
some
*NL*
in
he
should
be
forced
to
take
back
all
the
goods
she
had
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
take
them
!
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
only
joking
,
''
he
replied
;
``
the
only
thing
I
regret
is
the
whip
.
*NL*
My
word
!
I
'll
ask
monsieur
to
return
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
've
got
you
!
''
thought
Lheureux
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
certain
of
his
discovery
,
he
went
out
repeating
to
himself
in
an
*NL*
undertone
,
and
with
his
usual
low
whistle
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
we
shall
see
!
we
shall
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
thinking
how
to
get
out
of
this
when
the
servant
coming
in
*NL*
put
on
the
mantelpiece
a
small
roll
of
blue
paper
``
from
Monsieur
*NL*
Derozeray
's
.
''
Emma
pounced
upon
and
opened
it
.
It
contained
fifteen
*NL*
napoleons
;
it
was
the
account
.
She
heard
Charles
on
the
stairs
;
threw
*NL*
the
gold
to
the
back
of
her
drawer
,
and
took
out
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
after
Lheureux
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
arrangement
to
suggest
to
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
sum
agreed
on
,
you
would
take
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
she
said
placing
fourteen
napoleons
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tradesman
was
dumfounded
.
Then
,
to
conceal
his
disappointment
,
he
*NL*
was
profuse
in
apologies
and
proffers
of
service
,
all
of
which
Emma
*NL*
declined
;
then
she
remained
a
few
moments
fingering
in
the
pocket
of
*NL*
her
apron
the
two
five-franc
pieces
that
he
had
given
her
in
change
.
*NL*
She
promised
herself
she
would
economise
in
order
to
pay
back
later
on
.
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
''
she
thought
,
``
he
wo
n't
think
about
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
riding-whip
with
its
silver-gilt
handle
,
Rodolphe
had
*NL*
received
a
seal
with
the
motto
Amor
nel
cor
*
furthermore
,
a
scarf
for
*NL*
a
muffler
,
and
,
finally
,
a
cigar-case
exactly
like
the
Viscount
's
,
that
*NL*
Charles
had
formerly
picked
up
in
the
road
,
and
that
Emma
had
kept
.
*NL*
These
presents
,
however
,
humiliated
him
;
he
refused
several
;
she
*NL*
insisted
,
and
he
ended
by
obeying
,
thinking
her
tyrannical
and
*NL*
overexacting
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
loving
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
had
strange
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
midnight
strikes
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
must
think
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
he
confessed
that
he
had
not
thought
of
her
,
there
were
floods
of
*NL*
reproaches
that
always
ended
with
the
eternal
question
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
love
you
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
deal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
loved
any
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
think
you
'd
got
a
virgin
?
''
he
exclaimed
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
cried
,
and
he
tried
to
console
her
,
adorning
his
protestations
with
*NL*
puns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
I
love
you
!
I
love
you
so
that
I
could
not
live
*NL*
without
you
,
do
you
see
?
There
are
times
when
I
long
to
see
you
again
,
*NL*
when
I
am
torn
by
all
the
anger
of
love
.
I
ask
myself
,
Where
is
*NL*
he
?
Perhaps
he
is
talking
to
other
women
.
They
smile
upon
him
;
he
*NL*
approaches
.
Oh
no
;
no
one
else
pleases
you
.
There
are
some
more
*NL*
beautiful
,
but
I
love
you
best
.
I
know
how
to
love
best
.
I
am
your
*NL*
servant
,
your
concubine
!
You
are
my
king
,
my
idol
!
You
are
good
,
you
are
*NL*
beautiful
,
you
are
clever
,
you
are
strong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
so
often
heard
these
things
said
that
they
did
not
strike
him
as
*NL*
original
.
Emma
was
like
all
his
mistresses
;
and
the
charm
of
novelty
,
*NL*
gradually
falling
away
like
a
garment
,
laid
bare
the
eternal
monotony
*NL*
of
passion
,
that
has
always
the
same
forms
and
the
same
language
.
He
*NL*
did
not
distinguish
,
this
man
of
so
much
experience
,
the
difference
of
*NL*
sentiment
beneath
the
sameness
of
expression
.
Because
lips
libertine
*NL*
and
venal
had
murmured
such
words
to
him
,
he
believed
but
little
in
the
*NL*
candour
of
hers
;
exaggerated
speeches
hiding
mediocre
affections
must
be
*NL*
discounted
;
as
if
the
fullness
of
the
soul
did
not
sometimes
overflow
in
*NL*
the
emptiest
metaphors
,
since
no
one
can
ever
give
the
exact
measure
of
*NL*
his
needs
,
nor
of
his
conceptions
,
nor
of
his
sorrows
;
and
since
human
*NL*
speech
is
like
a
cracked
tin
kettle
,
on
which
we
hammer
out
tunes
to
*NL*
make
bears
dance
when
we
long
to
move
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
that
superior
critical
judgment
that
belongs
to
him
who
,
in
no
*NL*
matter
what
circumstance
,
holds
back
,
Rodolphe
saw
other
delights
to
be
*NL*
got
out
of
this
love
.
He
thought
all
modesty
in
the
way
.
He
treated
her
*NL*
quite
sans
facon
.
*
He
made
of
her
something
supple
and
corrupt
.
Hers
*NL*
was
an
idiotic
sort
of
attachment
,
full
of
admiration
for
him
,
of
*NL*
voluptuousness
for
her
,
a
beatitude
that
benumbed
her
;
her
soul
sank
*NL*
into
this
drunkenness
,
shrivelled
up
,
drowned
in
it
,
like
Clarence
in
*NL*
his
butt
of
Malmsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Off-handedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
mere
effect
of
her
love
Madame
Bovary
's
manners
changed
.
*NL*
Her
looks
grew
bolder
,
her
speech
more
free
;
she
even
committed
the
*NL*
impropriety
of
walking
out
with
Monsieur
Rodolphe
,
a
cigarette
in
her
*NL*
mouth
,
``
as
if
to
defy
the
people
.
''
At
last
,
those
who
still
doubted
*NL*
doubted
no
longer
when
one
day
they
saw
her
getting
out
of
the
*NL*
``
Hirondelle
,
''
her
waist
squeezed
into
a
waistcoat
like
a
man
;
and
Madame
*NL*
Bovary
senior
,
who
,
after
a
fearful
scene
with
her
husband
,
had
taken
*NL*
refuge
at
her
son
's
,
was
not
the
least
scandalised
of
the
women-folk
.
*NL*
Many
other
things
displeased
her
.
First
,
Charles
had
not
attended
to
*NL*
her
advice
about
the
forbidding
of
novels
;
then
the
``
ways
of
the
house
''
*NL*
annoyed
her
;
she
allowed
herself
to
make
some
remarks
,
and
there
were
*NL*
quarrels
,
especially
one
on
account
of
Felicite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
senior
,
the
evening
before
,
passing
along
the
passage
,
*NL*
had
surprised
her
in
company
of
a
man
--
a
man
with
a
brown
collar
,
about
*NL*
forty
years
old
,
who
,
at
the
sound
of
her
step
,
had
quickly
escaped
*NL*
through
the
kitchen
.
Then
Emma
began
to
laugh
,
but
the
good
lady
grew
*NL*
angry
,
declaring
that
unless
morals
were
to
be
laughed
at
one
ought
to
*NL*
look
after
those
of
one
's
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
brought
up
?
''
asked
the
daughter-in-law
,
with
so
*NL*
impertinent
a
look
that
Madame
Bovary
asked
her
if
she
were
not
perhaps
*NL*
defending
her
own
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
room
!
''
said
the
young
woman
,
springing
up
with
a
bound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
!
Mamma
!
''
cried
Charles
,
trying
to
reconcile
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
both
had
fled
in
their
exasperation
.
Emma
was
stamping
her
feet
as
*NL*
she
repeated
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
what
manners
!
What
a
peasant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
to
his
mother
;
she
was
beside
herself
.
She
stammered
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
an
insolent
,
giddy-headed
thing
,
or
perhaps
worse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
for
leaving
at
once
if
the
other
did
not
apologise
.
So
*NL*
Charles
went
back
again
to
his
wife
and
implored
her
to
give
way
;
he
*NL*
knelt
to
her
;
she
ended
by
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
I
'll
go
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
fact
she
held
out
her
hand
to
her
mother-in-law
with
the
dignity
*NL*
of
a
marchioness
as
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
having
gone
up
again
to
her
room
,
she
threw
herself
flat
on
her
*NL*
bed
and
cried
there
like
a
child
,
her
face
buried
in
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
Rodolphe
had
agreed
that
in
the
event
of
anything
extraordinary
*NL*
occurring
,
she
should
fasten
a
small
piece
of
white
paper
to
the
blind
,
*NL*
so
that
if
by
chance
he
happened
to
be
in
Yonville
,
he
could
hurry
to
*NL*
the
lane
behind
the
house
.
Emma
made
the
signal
;
she
had
been
waiting
*NL*
three-quarters
of
an
hour
when
she
suddenly
caught
sight
of
Rodolphe
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
market
.
She
felt
tempted
to
open
the
window
and
call
*NL*
him
,
but
he
had
already
disappeared
.
She
fell
back
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
,
however
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
was
walking
on
the
*NL*
pavement
.
It
was
he
,
no
doubt
.
She
went
downstairs
,
crossed
the
yard
.
He
*NL*
was
there
outside
.
She
threw
herself
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
take
care
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
if
you
knew
!
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
telling
him
everything
,
hurriedly
,
disjointedly
,
*NL*
exaggerating
the
facts
,
inventing
many
,
and
so
prodigal
of
parentheses
*NL*
that
he
understood
nothing
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
poor
angel
,
courage
!
Be
comforted
!
be
patient
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
been
patient
;
I
have
suffered
for
four
years
.
A
love
like
*NL*
ours
ought
to
show
itself
in
the
face
of
heaven
.
They
torture
me
!
I
can
*NL*
bear
it
no
longer
!
Save
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
clung
to
Rodolphe
.
Her
eyes
,
full
of
tears
,
flashed
like
flames
*NL*
beneath
a
wave
;
her
breast
heaved
;
he
had
never
loved
her
so
much
,
so
*NL*
that
he
lost
his
head
and
said
``
What
is
,
it
?
What
do
you
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
away
,
''
she
cried
,
``
carry
me
off
!
Oh
,
I
pray
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
threw
herself
upon
his
mouth
,
as
if
to
seize
there
the
*NL*
unexpected
consent
if
breathed
forth
in
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
Rodolphe
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
little
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reflected
a
few
moments
,
then
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
take
her
!
It
ca
n't
be
helped
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
woman
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
watching
her
as
she
went
.
For
she
*NL*
had
run
into
the
garden
.
Someone
was
calling
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
days
Madame
Bovary
senior
was
much
surprised
at
the
*NL*
change
in
her
daughter-in-law
.
Emma
,
in
fact
,
was
showing
herself
more
*NL*
docile
,
and
even
carried
her
deference
so
far
as
to
ask
for
a
recipe
for
*NL*
pickling
gherkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
the
better
to
deceive
them
both
?
Or
did
she
wish
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
voluptuous
stoicism
to
feel
the
more
profoundly
the
bitterness
of
the
*NL*
things
she
was
about
to
leave
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
paid
no
heed
to
them
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
lived
as
lost
in
the
*NL*
anticipated
delight
of
her
coming
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
eternal
subject
for
conversation
with
Rodolphe
.
She
leant
on
*NL*
his
shoulder
murmuring
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
when
we
are
in
the
mail-coach
!
Do
you
think
about
it
?
Can
it
be
?
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
the
moment
I
feel
the
carriage
start
,
it
will
be
as
if
*NL*
we
were
rising
in
a
balloon
,
as
if
we
were
setting
out
for
the
clouds
.
*NL*
Do
you
know
that
I
count
the
hours
?
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
Madame
Bovary
been
so
beautiful
as
at
this
period
;
she
had
*NL*
that
indefinable
beauty
that
results
from
joy
,
from
enthusiasm
,
from
*NL*
success
,
and
that
is
only
the
harmony
of
temperament
with
circumstances
.
*NL*
Her
desires
,
her
sorrows
,
the
experience
of
pleasure
,
and
her
ever-young
*NL*
illusions
,
that
had
,
as
soil
and
rain
and
winds
and
the
sun
make
flowers
*NL*
grow
,
gradually
developed
her
,
and
she
at
length
blossomed
forth
in
all
*NL*
the
plenitude
of
her
nature
.
Her
eyelids
seemed
chiselled
expressly
for
*NL*
her
long
amorous
looks
in
which
the
pupil
disappeared
,
while
a
strong
*NL*
inspiration
expanded
her
delicate
nostrils
and
raised
the
fleshy
corner
*NL*
of
her
lips
,
shaded
in
the
light
by
a
little
black
down
.
One
would
have
*NL*
thought
that
an
artist
apt
in
conception
had
arranged
the
curls
of
hair
*NL*
upon
her
neck
;
they
fell
in
a
thick
mass
,
negligently
,
and
with
the
*NL*
changing
chances
of
their
adultery
,
that
unbound
them
every
day
.
Her
*NL*
voice
now
took
more
mellow
infections
,
her
figure
also
;
something
subtle
*NL*
and
penetrating
escaped
even
from
the
folds
of
her
gown
and
from
the
*NL*
line
of
her
foot
.
Charles
,
as
when
they
were
first
married
,
thought
her
*NL*
delicious
and
quite
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
he
did
not
dare
to
wake
*NL*
her
.
The
porcelain
night-light
threw
a
round
trembling
gleam
upon
the
*NL*
ceiling
,
and
the
drawn
curtains
of
the
little
cot
formed
as
it
were
a
*NL*
white
hut
standing
out
in
the
shade
,
and
by
the
bedside
Charles
looked
*NL*
at
them
.
He
seemed
to
hear
the
light
breathing
of
his
child
.
She
would
*NL*
grow
big
now
;
every
season
would
bring
rapid
progress
.
He
already
saw
*NL*
her
coming
from
school
as
the
day
drew
in
,
laughing
,
with
ink-stains
on
*NL*
her
jacket
,
and
carrying
her
basket
on
her
arm
.
Then
she
would
have
to
*NL*
be
sent
to
the
boarding-school
;
that
would
cost
much
;
how
was
it
to
*NL*
be
done
?
Then
he
reflected
.
He
thought
of
hiring
a
small
farm
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
that
he
would
superintend
every
morning
on
his
way
to
his
*NL*
patients
.
He
would
save
up
what
he
brought
in
;
he
would
put
it
in
the
*NL*
savings-bank
.
Then
he
would
buy
shares
somewhere
,
no
matter
where
;
*NL*
besides
,
his
practice
would
increase
;
he
counted
upon
that
,
for
he
*NL*
wanted
Berthe
to
be
well-educated
,
to
be
accomplished
,
to
learn
to
play
*NL*
the
piano
.
Ah
!
how
pretty
she
would
be
later
on
when
she
was
fifteen
,
*NL*
when
,
resembling
her
mother
,
she
would
,
like
her
,
wear
large
straw
hats
*NL*
in
the
summer-time
;
from
a
distance
they
would
be
taken
for
two
sisters
.
*NL*
He
pictured
her
to
himself
working
in
the
evening
by
their
side
beneath
*NL*
the
light
of
the
lamp
;
she
would
embroider
him
slippers
;
she
would
look
*NL*
after
the
house
;
she
would
fill
all
the
home
with
her
charm
and
her
*NL*
gaiety
.
At
last
,
they
would
think
of
her
marriage
;
they
would
find
her
*NL*
some
good
young
fellow
with
a
steady
business
;
he
would
make
her
happy
;
*NL*
this
would
last
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
not
asleep
;
she
pretended
to
be
;
and
while
he
dozed
off
by
her
*NL*
side
she
awakened
to
other
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
gallop
of
four
horses
she
was
carried
away
for
a
week
towards
a
*NL*
new
land
,
whence
they
would
return
no
more
.
They
went
on
and
on
,
their
*NL*
arms
entwined
,
without
a
word
.
Often
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
there
*NL*
suddenly
glimpsed
some
splendid
city
with
domes
,
and
bridges
,
and
*NL*
ships
,
forests
of
citron
trees
,
and
cathedrals
of
white
marble
,
on
whose
*NL*
pointed
steeples
were
storks
'
nests
.
They
went
at
a
walking-pace
because
*NL*
of
the
great
flag-stones
,
and
on
the
ground
there
were
bouquets
of
*NL*
flowers
,
offered
you
by
women
dressed
in
red
bodices
.
They
heard
the
*NL*
chiming
of
bells
,
the
neighing
of
mules
,
together
with
the
murmur
of
*NL*
guitars
and
the
noise
of
fountains
,
whose
rising
spray
refreshed
heaps
*NL*
of
fruit
arranged
like
a
pyramid
at
the
foot
of
pale
statues
that
smiled
*NL*
beneath
playing
waters
.
And
then
,
one
night
they
came
to
a
fishing
*NL*
village
,
where
brown
nets
were
drying
in
the
wind
along
the
cliffs
and
*NL*
in
front
of
the
huts
.
It
was
there
that
they
would
stay
;
they
would
live
*NL*
in
a
low
,
flat-roofed
house
,
shaded
by
a
palm-tree
,
in
the
heart
of
a
*NL*
gulf
,
by
the
sea
.
They
would
row
in
gondolas
,
swing
in
hammocks
,
and
*NL*
their
existence
would
be
easy
and
large
as
their
silk
gowns
,
warm
and
*NL*
star-spangled
as
the
nights
they
would
contemplate
.
However
,
in
the
*NL*
immensity
of
this
future
that
she
conjured
up
,
nothing
special
stood
*NL*
forth
;
the
days
,
all
magnificent
,
resembled
each
other
like
waves
;
and
*NL*
it
swayed
in
the
horizon
,
infinite
,
harmonised
,
azure
,
and
bathed
in
*NL*
sunshine
.
But
the
child
began
to
cough
in
her
cot
or
Bovary
snored
*NL*
more
loudly
,
and
Emma
did
not
fall
asleep
till
morning
,
when
the
dawn
*NL*
whitened
the
windows
,
and
when
little
Justin
was
already
in
the
square
*NL*
taking
down
the
shutters
of
the
chemist
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
sent
for
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
and
had
said
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
cloak
--
a
large
lined
cloak
with
a
deep
collar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
on
a
journey
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
--
never
mind
.
I
may
count
on
you
,
may
I
not
,
and
quickly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
I
shall
want
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
a
trunk
--
not
too
heavy
--
handy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
.
About
three
feet
by
a
foot
and
a
half
,
as
they
*NL*
are
being
made
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
travelling
bag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
''
thought
Lheureux
,
``
there
's
a
row
on
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
said
Madame
Bovary
,
taking
her
watch
from
her
belt
,
``
take
this
;
*NL*
you
can
pay
yourself
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tradesman
cried
out
that
she
was
wrong
;
they
knew
one
another
;
*NL*
did
he
doubt
her
?
What
childishness
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
insisted
,
however
,
on
his
taking
at
least
the
chain
,
and
Lheureux
*NL*
had
already
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
was
going
,
when
she
called
him
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
leave
everything
at
your
place
.
As
to
the
cloak
''
--
she
seemed
*NL*
to
be
reflecting
--
``
do
not
bring
it
either
;
you
can
give
me
the
maker
's
*NL*
address
,
and
tell
him
to
have
it
ready
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
next
month
that
they
were
to
run
away
.
She
was
to
leave
*NL*
Yonville
as
if
she
was
going
on
some
business
to
Rouen
.
Rodolphe
would
*NL*
have
booked
the
seats
,
procured
the
passports
,
and
even
have
written
to
*NL*
Paris
in
order
to
have
the
whole
mail-coach
reserved
for
them
as
far
as
*NL*
Marseilles
,
where
they
would
buy
a
carriage
,
and
go
on
thence
without
*NL*
stopping
to
Genoa
.
She
would
take
care
to
send
her
luggage
to
Lheureux
*NL*
whence
it
would
be
taken
direct
to
the
``
Hirondelle
,
''
so
that
no
one
*NL*
would
have
any
suspicion
.
And
in
all
this
there
never
was
any
allusion
*NL*
to
the
child
.
Rodolphe
avoided
speaking
of
her
;
perhaps
he
no
longer
*NL*
thought
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
to
have
two
more
weeks
before
him
to
arrange
some
affairs
;
*NL*
then
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
wanted
two
more
;
then
he
said
he
was
ill
;
*NL*
next
he
went
on
a
journey
.
The
month
of
August
passed
,
and
,
after
all
*NL*
these
delays
,
they
decided
that
it
was
to
be
irrevocably
fixed
for
the
*NL*
4th
September
--
a
Monday
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
Saturday
before
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
came
in
the
evening
earlier
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
ready
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
walked
round
a
garden-bed
,
and
went
to
sit
down
near
the
*NL*
terrace
on
the
kerb-stone
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sad
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
looked
at
her
strangely
in
a
tender
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
because
you
are
going
away
?
''
she
went
on
;
``
because
you
are
*NL*
leaving
what
is
dear
to
you
--
your
life
?
Ah
!
I
understand
.
I
have
nothing
*NL*
in
the
world
!
you
are
all
to
me
;
so
shall
I
be
to
you
.
I
will
be
your
*NL*
people
,
your
country
;
I
will
tend
,
I
will
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sweet
you
are
!
''
he
said
,
seizing
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
she
said
with
a
voluptuous
laugh
.
``
Do
you
love
me
?
Swear
it
*NL*
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
love
you
--
love
you
?
I
adore
you
,
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
,
full
and
purple-coloured
,
was
rising
right
out
of
the
earth
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
meadow
.
She
rose
quickly
between
the
branches
of
the
*NL*
poplars
,
that
hid
her
here
and
there
like
a
black
curtain
pierced
with
*NL*
holes
.
Then
she
appeared
dazzling
with
whiteness
in
the
empty
heavens
*NL*
that
she
lit
up
,
and
now
sailing
more
slowly
along
,
let
fall
upon
the
*NL*
river
a
great
stain
that
broke
up
into
an
infinity
of
stars
;
and
the
*NL*
silver
sheen
seemed
to
writhe
through
the
very
depths
like
a
heedless
*NL*
serpent
covered
with
luminous
scales
;
it
also
resembled
some
monster
*NL*
candelabra
all
along
which
sparkled
drops
of
diamonds
running
together
.
*NL*
The
soft
night
was
about
them
;
masses
of
shadow
filled
the
branches
.
*NL*
Emma
,
her
eyes
half
closed
,
breathed
in
with
deep
sighs
the
fresh
wind
*NL*
that
was
blowing
.
They
did
not
speak
,
lost
as
they
were
in
the
rush
of
*NL*
their
reverie
.
The
tenderness
of
the
old
days
came
back
to
their
hearts
,
*NL*
full
and
silent
as
the
flowing
river
,
with
the
softness
of
the
perfume
*NL*
of
the
syringas
,
and
threw
across
their
memories
shadows
more
immense
*NL*
and
more
sombre
than
those
of
the
still
willows
that
lengthened
out
over
*NL*
the
grass
.
Often
some
night-animal
,
hedgehog
or
weasel
,
setting
out
on
*NL*
the
hunt
,
disturbed
the
lovers
,
or
sometimes
they
heard
a
ripe
peach
*NL*
falling
all
alone
from
the
espalier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
what
a
lovely
night
!
''
said
Rodolphe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
others
,
''
replied
Emma
;
and
,
as
if
speaking
to
herself
:
*NL*
``
Yet
,
it
will
be
good
to
travel
.
And
yet
,
why
should
my
heart
be
*NL*
so
heavy
?
Is
it
dread
of
the
unknown
?
The
effect
of
habits
left
?
Or
*NL*
rather
--
?
No
;
it
is
the
excess
of
happiness
.
How
weak
I
am
,
am
I
not
?
*NL*
Forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
still
time
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Reflect
!
perhaps
you
may
repent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
''
she
cried
impetuously
.
And
coming
closer
to
him
:
``
What
ill
*NL*
could
come
to
me
?
There
is
no
desert
,
no
precipice
,
no
ocean
I
would
not
*NL*
traverse
with
you
.
The
longer
we
live
together
the
more
it
will
be
like
*NL*
an
embrace
,
every
day
closer
,
more
heart
to
heart
.
There
will
be
*NL*
nothing
to
trouble
us
,
no
cares
,
no
obstacle
.
We
shall
be
alone
,
all
to
*NL*
ourselves
eternally
.
Oh
,
speak
!
Answer
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
regular
intervals
he
answered
,
``
Yes
--
Yes
--
''
She
had
passed
her
hands
*NL*
through
his
hair
,
and
she
repeated
in
a
childlike
voice
,
despite
the
big
*NL*
tears
which
were
falling
,
``
Rodolphe
!
Rodolphe
!
Ah
!
Rodolphe
!
dear
little
*NL*
Rodolphe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Midnight
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Midnight
!
''
said
she
.
``
Come
,
it
is
to-morrow
.
One
day
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
to
go
;
and
as
if
the
movement
he
made
had
been
the
signal
for
*NL*
their
flight
,
Emma
said
,
suddenly
assuming
a
gay
air
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
the
passports
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
forgetting
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
at
the
Hotel
de
Provence
,
is
it
not
,
that
you
will
wait
for
me
at
*NL*
midday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
to-morrow
then
!
''
said
Emma
in
a
last
caress
;
and
she
watched
him
*NL*
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
turn
round
.
She
ran
after
him
,
and
,
leaning
over
the
water
's
*NL*
edge
between
the
bulrushes
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
already
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
walking
fast
across
*NL*
the
meadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
moments
Rodolphe
stopped
;
and
when
he
saw
her
with
her
white
*NL*
gown
gradually
fade
away
in
the
shade
like
a
ghost
,
he
was
seized
with
*NL*
such
a
beating
of
the
heart
that
he
leant
against
a
tree
lest
he
should
*NL*
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
imbecile
I
am
!
''
he
said
with
a
fearful
oath
.
``
No
matter
!
She
*NL*
was
a
pretty
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
immediately
Emma
's
beauty
,
with
all
the
pleasures
of
their
love
,
*NL*
came
back
to
him
.
For
a
moment
he
softened
;
then
he
rebelled
against
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
,
after
all
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
gesticulating
,
``
I
ca
n't
exile
*NL*
myself
--
have
a
child
on
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
saying
these
things
to
give
himself
firmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
besides
,
the
worry
,
the
expense
!
Ah
!
no
,
no
,
no
,
no
!
a
thousand
*NL*
times
no
!
That
would
be
too
stupid

*NL*
Chapter
Thirteen
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
Rodolphe
at
home
than
he
sat
down
quickly
at
his
bureau
*NL*
under
the
stag
's
head
that
hung
as
a
trophy
on
the
wall
.
But
when
he
had
*NL*
the
pen
between
his
fingers
,
he
could
think
of
nothing
,
so
that
,
resting
*NL*
on
his
elbows
,
he
began
to
reflect
.
Emma
seemed
to
him
to
have
receded
*NL*
into
a
far-off
past
,
as
if
the
resolution
he
had
taken
had
suddenly
*NL*
placed
a
distance
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
back
something
of
her
,
he
fetched
from
the
cupboard
at
the
*NL*
bedside
an
old
Rheims
biscuit-box
,
in
which
he
usually
kept
his
letters
*NL*
from
women
,
and
from
it
came
an
odour
of
dry
dust
and
withered
*NL*
roses
.
First
he
saw
a
handkerchief
with
pale
little
spots
.
It
was
a
*NL*
handkerchief
of
hers
.
Once
when
they
were
walking
her
nose
had
bled
;
he
*NL*
had
forgotten
it
.
Near
it
,
chipped
at
all
the
corners
,
was
a
miniature
*NL*
given
him
by
Emma
:
her
toilette
seemed
to
him
pretentious
,
and
her
*NL*
languishing
look
in
the
worst
possible
taste
.
Then
,
from
looking
at
this
*NL*
image
and
recalling
the
memory
of
its
original
,
Emma
's
features
little
*NL*
by
little
grew
confused
in
his
remembrance
,
as
if
the
living
and
the
*NL*
painted
face
,
rubbing
one
against
the
other
,
had
effaced
each
other
.
*NL*
Finally
,
he
read
some
of
her
letters
;
they
were
full
of
explanations
*NL*
relating
to
their
journey
,
short
,
technical
,
and
urgent
,
like
business
*NL*
notes
.
He
wanted
to
see
the
long
ones
again
,
those
of
old
times
.
In
*NL*
order
to
find
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
,
Rodolphe
disturbed
all
the
*NL*
others
,
and
mechanically
began
rummaging
amidst
this
mass
of
papers
and
*NL*
things
,
finding
pell-mell
bouquets
,
garters
,
a
black
mask
,
pins
,
and
*NL*
hair
--
hair
!
dark
and
fair
,
some
even
,
catching
in
the
hinges
of
the
box
,
*NL*
broke
when
it
was
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
dallying
with
his
souvenirs
,
he
examined
the
writing
and
the
style
*NL*
of
the
letters
,
as
varied
as
their
orthography
.
They
were
tender
or
*NL*
jovial
,
facetious
,
melancholy
;
there
were
some
that
asked
for
love
,
*NL*
others
that
asked
for
money
.
A
word
recalled
faces
to
him
,
certain
*NL*
gestures
,
the
sound
of
a
voice
;
sometimes
,
however
,
he
remembered
*NL*
nothing
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
these
women
,
rushing
at
once
into
his
thoughts
,
cramped
each
*NL*
other
and
lessened
,
as
reduced
to
a
uniform
level
of
love
that
equalised
*NL*
them
all
.
So
taking
handfuls
of
the
mixed-up
letters
,
he
amused
himself
*NL*
for
some
moments
with
letting
them
fall
in
cascades
from
his
right
into
*NL*
his
left
hand
.
At
last
,
bored
and
weary
,
Rodolphe
took
back
the
box
to
*NL*
the
cupboard
,
saying
to
himself
,
``
What
a
lot
of
rubbish
!
''
Which
summed
*NL*
up
his
opinion
;
for
pleasures
,
like
schoolboys
in
a
school
courtyard
,
*NL*
had
so
trampled
upon
his
heart
that
no
green
thing
grew
there
,
and
that
*NL*
which
passed
through
it
,
more
heedless
than
children
,
did
not
even
,
like
*NL*
them
,
leave
a
name
carved
upon
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
he
,
``
let
's
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wrote
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
,
Emma
!
courage
!
I
would
not
bring
misery
into
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
that
's
true
,
''
thought
Rodolphe
.
``
I
am
acting
in
her
*NL*
interest
;
I
am
honest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
carefully
weighed
your
resolution
?
Do
you
know
to
what
an
*NL*
abyss
I
was
dragging
you
,
poor
angel
?
No
,
you
do
not
,
do
you
?
You
were
*NL*
coming
confident
and
fearless
,
believing
in
happiness
in
the
future
.
Ah
!
*NL*
unhappy
that
we
are
--
insensate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
stopped
here
to
think
of
some
good
excuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
told
her
all
my
fortune
is
lost
?
No
!
Besides
,
that
would
stop
*NL*
nothing
.
It
would
all
have
to
be
begun
over
again
later
on
.
As
if
one
*NL*
could
make
women
like
that
listen
to
reason
!
''
He
reflected
,
then
went
*NL*
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
forget
you
,
oh
believe
it
;
and
I
shall
ever
have
a
profound
*NL*
devotion
for
you
;
but
some
day
,
sooner
or
later
,
this
ardour
-LRB-
such
is
*NL*
the
fate
of
human
things
-RRB-
would
have
grown
less
,
no
doubt
.
Lassitude
*NL*
would
have
come
to
us
,
and
who
knows
if
I
should
not
even
have
had
the
*NL*
atrocious
pain
of
witnessing
your
remorse
,
of
sharing
it
myself
,
since
*NL*
I
should
have
been
its
cause
?
The
mere
idea
of
the
grief
that
would
come
*NL*
to
you
tortures
me
,
Emma
.
Forget
me
!
Why
did
I
ever
know
you
?
Why
were
*NL*
you
so
beautiful
?
Is
it
my
fault
?
O
my
God
!
No
,
no
!
Accuse
only
fate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
word
that
always
tells
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
you
had
been
one
of
those
frivolous
women
that
one
sees
,
*NL*
certainly
I
might
,
through
egotism
,
have
tried
an
experiment
,
in
that
*NL*
case
without
danger
for
you
.
But
that
delicious
exaltation
,
at
once
your
*NL*
charm
and
your
torment
,
has
prevented
you
from
understanding
,
adorable
*NL*
woman
that
you
are
,
the
falseness
of
our
future
position
.
Nor
had
I
*NL*
reflected
upon
this
at
first
,
and
I
rested
in
the
shade
of
that
ideal
*NL*
happiness
as
beneath
that
of
the
manchineel
tree
,
without
foreseeing
the
*NL*
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
'll
think
I
'm
giving
it
up
from
avarice
.
Ah
,
well
!
so
much
*NL*
the
worse
;
it
must
be
stopped
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
is
cruel
,
Emma
.
Wherever
we
might
have
gone
,
it
would
have
*NL*
persecuted
us
.
You
would
have
had
to
put
up
with
indiscreet
questions
,
*NL*
calumny
,
contempt
,
insult
perhaps
.
Insult
to
you
!
Oh
!
And
I
,
who
would
*NL*
place
you
on
a
throne
!
I
who
bear
with
me
your
memory
as
a
talisman

For
*NL*
I
am
going
to
punish
myself
by
exile
for
all
the
ill
I
have
done
you
.
*NL*
I
am
going
away

Whither
I
know
not

I
am
mad

Adieu

Be
good
always
.
*NL*
Preserve
the
memory
of
the
unfortunate
who
has
lost
you
.
Teach
my
name
*NL*
to
your
child
;
let
her
repeat
it
in
her
prayers

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wicks
of
the
candles
flickered
.
Rodolphe
got
up
to
,
shut
the
window
,
*NL*
and
when
he
had
sat
down
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
all
right

Ah
!
and
this
for
fear
she
should
come
and
hunt
*NL*
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
far
away
when
you
read
these
sad
lines
,
for
I
have
wished
to
*NL*
flee
as
quickly
as
possible
to
shun
the
temptation
of
seeing
you
again
.
*NL*
No
weakness
!
I
shall
return
,
and
perhaps
later
on
we
shall
talk
together
*NL*
very
coldly
of
our
old
love
.
Adieu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
a
last
``
adieu
''
divided
into
two
words
!
``
A
Dieu
!
''
which
he
*NL*
thought
in
very
excellent
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
how
am
I
to
sign
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
''
`
Yours
devotedly

No
!
*NL*
`
Your
friend

Yes
,
that
's
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
re-read
his
letter
.
He
considered
it
very
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
woman
!
''
he
thought
with
emotion
.
``
She
'll
think
me
harder
*NL*
than
a
rock
.
There
ought
to
have
been
some
tears
on
this
;
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
cry
;
it
is
n't
my
fault

''
Then
,
having
emptied
some
water
into
a
glass
,
*NL*
Rodolphe
dipped
his
finger
into
it
,
and
let
a
big
drop
fall
on
the
*NL*
paper
,
that
made
a
pale
stain
on
the
ink
.
Then
looking
for
a
seal
,
he
*NL*
came
upon
the
one
``
Amor
nel
cor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
at
all
fit
in
with
the
circumstances
.
Pshaw
!
never
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
which
he
smoked
three
pipes
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
when
he
was
up
-LRB-
at
about
two
o'clock
--
he
had
slept
late
-RRB-
,
*NL*
Rodolphe
had
a
basket
of
apricots
picked
.
He
put
his
letter
at
*NL*
the
bottom
under
some
vine
leaves
,
and
at
once
ordered
Girard
,
his
*NL*
ploughman
,
to
take
it
with
care
to
Madame
Bovary
.
He
made
use
of
this
*NL*
means
for
corresponding
with
her
,
sending
according
to
the
season
fruits
*NL*
or
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
asks
after
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
will
tell
her
that
I
have
gone
on
*NL*
a
journey
.
You
must
give
the
basket
to
her
herself
,
into
her
own
hands
.
*NL*
Get
along
and
take
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Girard
put
on
his
new
blouse
,
knotted
his
handkerchief
round
the
*NL*
apricots
,
and
walking
with
great
heavy
steps
in
his
thick
iron-bound
*NL*
galoshes
,
made
his
way
to
Yonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
,
when
he
got
to
her
house
,
was
arranging
a
bundle
of
linen
*NL*
on
the
kitchen-table
with
Felicite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
the
ploughboy
,
``
is
something
for
you
--
from
the
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seized
with
apprehension
,
and
as
she
sought
in
her
pocket
for
*NL*
some
coppers
,
she
looked
at
the
peasant
with
haggard
eyes
,
while
he
*NL*
himself
looked
at
her
with
amazement
,
not
understanding
how
such
a
*NL*
present
could
so
move
anyone
.
At
last
he
went
out
.
Felicite
remained
.
*NL*
She
could
bear
it
no
longer
;
she
ran
into
the
sitting
room
as
if
to
take
*NL*
the
apricots
there
,
overturned
the
basket
,
tore
away
the
leaves
,
found
*NL*
the
letter
,
opened
it
,
and
,
as
if
some
fearful
fire
were
behind
her
,
*NL*
Emma
flew
to
her
room
terrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
there
;
she
saw
him
;
he
spoke
to
her
;
she
heard
nothing
,
and
*NL*
she
went
on
quickly
up
the
stairs
,
breathless
,
distraught
,
dumb
,
and
*NL*
ever
holding
this
horrible
piece
of
paper
,
that
crackled
between
her
*NL*
fingers
like
a
plate
of
sheet-iron
.
On
the
second
floor
she
stopped
*NL*
before
the
attic
door
,
which
was
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
tried
to
calm
herself
;
she
recalled
the
letter
;
she
must
finish
*NL*
it
;
she
did
not
dare
to
.
And
where
?
How
?
She
would
be
seen
!
``
Ah
,
no
!
*NL*
here
,
''
she
thought
,
``
I
shall
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slates
threw
straight
down
a
heavy
heat
that
gripped
her
temples
,
*NL*
stifled
her
;
she
dragged
herself
to
the
closed
garret-window
.
She
drew
*NL*
back
the
bolt
,
and
the
dazzling
light
burst
in
with
a
leap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
,
beyond
the
roofs
,
stretched
the
open
country
till
it
was
lost
*NL*
to
sight
.
Down
below
,
underneath
her
,
the
village
square
was
empty
;
the
*NL*
stones
of
the
pavement
glittered
,
the
weathercocks
on
the
houses
were
*NL*
motionless
.
At
the
corner
of
the
street
,
from
a
lower
storey
,
rose
a
*NL*
kind
of
humming
with
strident
modulations
.
It
was
Binet
turning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
leant
against
the
embrasure
of
the
window
,
and
reread
the
letter
*NL*
with
angry
sneers
.
But
the
more
she
fixed
her
attention
upon
it
,
the
*NL*
more
confused
were
her
ideas
.
She
saw
him
again
,
heard
him
,
encircled
*NL*
him
with
her
arms
,
and
throbs
of
her
heart
,
that
beat
against
her
breast
*NL*
like
blows
of
a
sledge-hammer
,
grew
faster
and
faster
,
with
uneven
*NL*
intervals
.
She
looked
about
her
with
the
wish
that
the
earth
might
*NL*
crumble
into
pieces
.
Why
not
end
it
all
?
What
restrained
her
?
She
was
*NL*
free
.
She
advanced
,
looking
at
the
paving-stones
,
saying
to
herself
,
*NL*
``
Come
!
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
luminous
ray
that
came
straight
up
from
below
drew
the
weight
of
*NL*
her
body
towards
the
abyss
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
the
ground
of
the
*NL*
oscillating
square
went
up
the
walls
and
that
the
floor
dipped
on
*NL*
end
like
a
tossing
boat
.
She
was
right
at
the
edge
,
almost
hanging
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
vast
space
.
The
blue
of
the
heavens
suffused
her
,
the
air
*NL*
was
whirling
in
her
hollow
head
;
she
had
but
to
yield
,
to
let
herself
*NL*
be
taken
;
and
the
humming
of
the
lathe
never
ceased
,
like
an
angry
voice
*NL*
calling
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
!
Emma
!
''
cried
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wherever
are
you
?
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
that
she
had
just
escaped
from
death
almost
made
her
faint
*NL*
with
terror
.
She
closed
her
eyes
;
then
she
shivered
at
the
touch
of
a
*NL*
hand
on
her
sleeve
;
it
was
Felicite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
is
waiting
for
you
,
madame
;
the
soup
is
on
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
had
to
go
down
to
sit
at
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
eat
.
The
food
choked
her
.
Then
she
unfolded
her
napkin
as
*NL*
if
to
examine
the
darns
,
and
she
really
thought
of
applying
herself
to
*NL*
this
work
,
counting
the
threads
in
the
linen
.
Suddenly
the
remembrance
*NL*
of
the
letter
returned
to
her
.
How
had
she
lost
it
?
Where
could
she
find
*NL*
it
?
But
she
felt
such
weariness
of
spirit
that
she
could
not
even
invent
*NL*
a
pretext
for
leaving
the
table
.
Then
she
became
a
coward
;
she
was
*NL*
afraid
of
Charles
;
he
knew
all
,
that
was
certain
!
Indeed
he
pronounced
*NL*
these
words
in
a
strange
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
likely
to
see
Monsieur
Rodolphe
soon
again
,
it
seems
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
?
''
she
said
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
me
!
''
he
replied
,
rather
astonished
at
her
abrupt
tone
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
Girard
,
whom
I
met
just
now
at
the
door
of
the
Cafe
Francais
.
He
has
*NL*
gone
on
a
journey
,
or
is
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
surprises
you
in
that
?
He
absents
himself
like
that
from
time
*NL*
to
time
for
a
change
,
and
,
ma
foi
,
I
think
he
's
right
,
when
one
has
a
*NL*
fortune
and
is
a
bachelor
.
Besides
,
he
has
jolly
times
,
has
our
friend
.
*NL*
He
's
a
bit
of
a
rake
.
Monsieur
Langlois
told
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
for
propriety
's
sake
because
the
servant
came
in
.
She
put
*NL*
back
into
the
basket
the
apricots
scattered
on
the
sideboard
.
Charles
,
*NL*
without
noticing
his
wife
's
colour
,
had
them
brought
to
him
,
took
one
,
*NL*
and
bit
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
perfect
!
''
said
he
;
``
just
taste
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
handed
her
the
basket
,
which
she
put
away
from
her
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
just
smell
!
What
an
odour
!
''
he
remarked
,
passing
it
under
her
nose
*NL*
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
choking
,
''
she
cried
,
leaping
up
.
But
by
an
effort
of
will
the
*NL*
spasm
passed
;
then
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
is
nothing
!
It
is
nervousness
.
Sit
down
*NL*
and
go
on
eating
.
''
For
she
dreaded
lest
he
should
begin
questioning
her
,
*NL*
attending
to
her
,
that
she
should
not
be
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
to
obey
her
,
sat
down
again
,
and
he
spat
the
stones
of
the
*NL*
apricots
into
his
hands
,
afterwards
putting
them
on
his
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
blue
tilbury
passed
across
the
square
at
a
rapid
trot
.
Emma
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
and
fell
back
rigid
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Rodolphe
,
after
many
reflections
,
had
decided
to
set
out
for
*NL*
Rouen
.
Now
,
as
from
La
Huchette
to
Buchy
there
is
no
other
way
than
by
*NL*
Yonville
,
he
had
to
go
through
the
village
,
and
Emma
had
recognised
him
*NL*
by
the
rays
of
the
lanterns
,
which
like
lightning
flashed
through
the
*NL*
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chemist
,
at
the
tumult
which
broke
out
in
the
house
ran
thither
.
The
*NL*
table
with
all
the
plates
was
upset
;
sauce
,
meat
,
knives
,
the
salt
,
and
*NL*
cruet-stand
were
strewn
over
the
room
;
Charles
was
calling
for
help
;
*NL*
Berthe
,
scared
,
was
crying
;
and
Felicite
,
whose
hands
trembled
,
was
*NL*
unlacing
her
mistress
,
whose
whole
body
shivered
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
to
my
laboratory
for
some
aromatic
vinegar
,
''
said
the
*NL*
druggist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
as
she
opened
her
eyes
on
smelling
the
bottle
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
of
it
,
''
he
remarked
;
``
that
would
wake
any
dead
person
for
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
us
,
''
said
Charles
;
``
collect
yourself
;
it
is
your
Charles
,
who
*NL*
loves
you
.
Do
you
know
me
?
See
!
here
is
your
little
girl
!
Oh
,
kiss
her

The
child
stretched
out
her
arms
to
her
mother
to
cling
to
her
neck
.
But
*NL*
turning
away
her
head
,
Emma
said
in
a
broken
voice
``
No
,
no
!
no
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fainted
again
.
They
carried
her
to
her
bed
.
She
lay
there
stretched
*NL*
at
full
length
,
her
lips
apart
,
her
eyelids
closed
,
her
hands
open
,
*NL*
motionless
,
and
white
as
a
waxen
image
.
Two
streams
of
tears
flowed
from
*NL*
her
eyes
and
fell
slowly
upon
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
standing
up
,
was
at
the
back
of
the
alcove
,
and
the
chemist
,
*NL*
near
him
,
maintained
that
meditative
silence
that
is
becoming
on
the
*NL*
serious
occasions
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
uneasy
,
''
he
said
,
touching
his
elbow
;
``
I
think
the
paroxysm
*NL*
is
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
resting
a
little
now
,
''
answered
Charles
,
watching
her
*NL*
sleep
.
``
Poor
girl
!
poor
girl
!
She
had
gone
off
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Homais
asked
how
the
accident
had
come
about
.
Charles
answered
that
*NL*
she
had
been
taken
ill
suddenly
while
she
was
eating
some
apricots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extraordinary
!
''
continued
the
chemist
.
``
But
it
might
be
that
the
*NL*
apricots
had
brought
on
the
syncope
.
Some
natures
are
so
sensitive
to
*NL*
certain
smells
;
and
it
would
even
be
a
very
fine
question
to
study
both
*NL*
in
its
pathological
and
physiological
relation
.
The
priests
know
the
*NL*
importance
of
it
,
they
who
have
introduced
aromatics
into
all
their
*NL*
ceremonies
.
It
is
to
stupefy
the
senses
and
to
bring
on
ecstasies
--
a
*NL*
thing
,
moreover
,
very
easy
in
persons
of
the
weaker
sex
,
who
are
more
*NL*
delicate
than
the
other
.
Some
are
cited
who
faint
at
the
smell
of
burnt
*NL*
hartshorn
,
of
new
bread

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
;
you
'll
wake
her
!
''
said
Bovary
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
only
,
''
the
druggist
went
on
,
``
are
human
beings
subject
to
such
*NL*
anomalies

but
animals
also

Thus
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
singularly
*NL*
aphrodisiac
effect
produced
by
the
Nepeta
cataria

vulgarly
called
*NL*
catmint
,
on
the
feline
race

,
on
the

an
example

authenticity
I
can
answer
for

Bridaux
-LRB-
one
of
my
old
comrades
,
at
*NL*
present
established
in
the
Rue
Malpalu
-RRB-
possesses
a
dog
that
falls
into
*NL*
convulsions
as
soon
as
you
hold
out
a
snuff-box

him
.
He
often
even
*NL*
makes
the
experiment
before
his
friends
at
his
summer-house
at
Guillaume
*NL*
Wood
.
Would
anyone
believe
that
a
simple
sternutation
could
produce
such
*NL*
ravages
on
a
quadrupedal
organism
?
It
is
extremely
curious
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Charles
,
who
was
not
listening
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
shows
us
,
''
went
on
the
other
,
smiling
with
benign
*NL*
self-sufficiency
,
``
the
innumerable
irregularities
of
the
nervous
system
.
*NL*
With
regard
to
madame
,
she
has
always
seemed
to
me
,
I
confess
,
very
*NL*
susceptible
.
And
so
I
should
by
no
means
recommend
to
you
,
my
dear
*NL*
friend
,
any
of
those
so-called
remedies
that
,
under
the
pretence
*NL*
of
attacking
the
symptoms

attack
the
constitution

No

no
useless
*NL*
physicking
!
Diet
,
that
is
all
;
sedatives
,
emollients
,
dulcification
.
*NL*
Then
,
do
n't
you
think
that
perhaps
her
imagination
should
be
worked
*NL*
upon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
How
?
''
said
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
is
it
.
Such
is
indeed
the
question
.
`
That
is
the
question
,
'
as
*NL*
I
lately
read
in
a
newspaper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Emma
,
awaking
,
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
!
the
letter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
thought
she
was
delirious
;
and
she
was
by
midnight
.
Brain-fever
had
*NL*
set
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
forty-three
days
Charles
did
not
leave
her
.
He
gave
up
all
his
*NL*
patients
;
he
no
longer
went
to
bed
;
he
was
constantly
feeling
her
pulse
,
*NL*
putting
on
sinapisms
and
cold-water
compresses
.
He
sent
Justin
as
far
as
*NL*
Neufchatel
for
ice
;
the
ice
melted
on
the
way
;
he
sent
him
back
again
.
*NL*
He
called
Monsieur
Canivet
into
consultation
;
he
sent
for
Dr.
Lariviere
,
*NL*
his
old
master
,
from
Rouen
;
he
was
in
despair
.
What
alarmed
him
most
was
*NL*
Emma
's
prostration
,
for
she
did
not
speak
,
did
not
listen
,
did
not
even
*NL*
seem
to
suffer
,
as
if
her
body
and
soul
were
both
resting
together
after
*NL*
all
their
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
October
she
could
sit
up
in
bed
supported
by
*NL*
pillows
.
Charles
wept
when
he
saw
her
eat
her
first
bread-and-jelly
.
Her
*NL*
strength
returned
to
her
;
she
got
up
for
a
few
hours
of
an
afternoon
,
*NL*
and
one
day
,
when
she
felt
better
,
he
tried
to
take
her
,
leaning
on
his
*NL*
arm
,
for
a
walk
round
the
garden
.
The
sand
of
the
paths
was
disappearing
*NL*
beneath
the
dead
leaves
;
she
walked
slowly
,
dragging
along
her
slippers
,
*NL*
and
leaning
against
Charles
's
shoulder
.
She
smiled
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
thus
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
near
the
terrace
.
She
drew
*NL*
herself
up
slowly
,
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
look
.
She
looked
*NL*
far
off
,
as
far
as
she
could
,
but
on
the
horizon
were
only
great
*NL*
bonfires
of
grass
smoking
on
the
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
tire
yourself
,
my
darling
!
''
said
Bovary
.
And
,
pushing
her
*NL*
gently
to
make
her
go
into
the
arbour
,
``
Sit
down
on
this
seat
;
you
'll
be
*NL*
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
;
not
there
!
''
she
said
in
a
faltering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seized
with
giddiness
,
and
from
that
evening
her
illness
*NL*
recommenced
,
with
a
more
uncertain
character
,
it
is
true
,
and
more
*NL*
complex
symptoms
.
Now
she
suffered
in
her
heart
,
then
in
the
chest
,
the
*NL*
head
,
the
limbs
;
she
had
vomitings
,
in
which
Charles
thought
he
saw
the
*NL*
first
signs
of
cancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
besides
this
,
the
poor
fellow
was
worried
about
money
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Fourteen
*NL*
*NL*
To
begin
with
,
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
pay
Monsieur
Homais
for
all
*NL*
the
physic
supplied
by
him
,
and
though
,
as
a
medical
man
,
he
was
not
*NL*
obliged
to
pay
for
it
,
he
nevertheless
blushed
a
little
at
such
an
*NL*
obligation
.
Then
the
expenses
of
the
household
,
now
that
the
servant
was
*NL*
mistress
,
became
terrible
.
Bills
rained
in
upon
the
house
;
the
tradesmen
*NL*
grumbled
;
Monsieur
Lheureux
especially
harassed
him
.
In
fact
,
at
*NL*
the
height
of
Emma
's
illness
,
the
latter
,
taking
advantage
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
to
make
his
bill
larger
,
had
hurriedly
brought
the
cloak
,
*NL*
the
travelling-bag
,
two
trunks
instead
of
one
,
and
a
number
of
other
*NL*
things
.
It
was
very
well
for
Charles
to
say
he
did
not
want
them
.
The
*NL*
tradesman
answered
arrogantly
that
these
articles
had
been
ordered
,
and
*NL*
that
he
would
not
take
them
back
;
besides
,
it
would
vex
madame
in
her
*NL*
convalescence
;
the
doctor
had
better
think
it
over
;
in
short
,
he
was
*NL*
resolved
to
sue
him
rather
than
give
up
his
rights
and
take
back
his
*NL*
goods
.
Charles
subsequently
ordered
them
to
be
sent
back
to
the
shop
.
*NL*
Felicite
forgot
;
he
had
other
things
to
attend
to
;
then
thought
no
more
*NL*
about
them
.
Monsieur
Lheureux
returned
to
the
charge
,
and
,
by
turns
*NL*
threatening
and
whining
,
so
managed
that
Bovary
ended
by
signing
a
*NL*
bill
at
six
months
.
But
hardly
had
he
signed
this
bill
than
a
bold
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
him
:
it
was
to
borrow
a
thousand
francs
from
Lheureux
.
*NL*
So
,
with
an
embarrassed
air
,
he
asked
if
it
were
possible
to
get
them
,
*NL*
adding
that
it
would
be
for
a
year
,
at
any
interest
he
wished
.
Lheureux
*NL*
ran
off
to
his
shop
,
brought
back
the
money
,
and
dictated
another
bill
,
*NL*
by
which
Bovary
undertook
to
pay
to
his
order
on
the
1st
of
September
*NL*
next
the
sum
of
one
thousand
and
seventy
francs
,
which
,
with
the
hundred
*NL*
and
eighty
already
agreed
to
,
made
just
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
,
thus
*NL*
lending
at
six
per
cent
in
addition
to
one-fourth
for
commission
:
and
*NL*
the
things
bringing
him
in
a
good
third
at
the
least
,
this
ought
in
*NL*
twelve
months
to
give
him
a
profit
of
a
hundred
and
thirty
francs
.
He
*NL*
hoped
that
the
business
would
not
stop
there
;
that
the
bills
would
not
*NL*
be
paid
;
that
they
would
be
renewed
;
and
that
his
poor
little
money
,
*NL*
having
thriven
at
the
doctor
's
as
at
a
hospital
,
would
come
back
to
him
*NL*
one
day
considerably
more
plump
,
and
fat
enough
to
burst
his
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
,
moreover
,
succeeded
with
him
.
He
was
adjudicator
for
a
*NL*
supply
of
cider
to
the
hospital
at
Neufchatel
;
Monsieur
Guillaumin
*NL*
promised
him
some
shares
in
the
turf-pits
of
Gaumesnil
,
and
he
dreamt
of
*NL*
establishing
a
new
diligence
service
between
Arcueil
and
Rouen
,
which
*NL*
no
doubt
would
not
be
long
in
ruining
the
ramshackle
van
of
the
``
Lion
*NL*
d'Or
,
''
and
that
,
travelling
faster
,
at
a
cheaper
rate
,
and
carrying
more
*NL*
luggage
,
would
thus
put
into
his
hands
the
whole
commerce
of
Yonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
several
times
asked
himself
by
what
means
he
should
next
year
be
*NL*
able
to
pay
back
so
much
money
.
He
reflected
,
imagined
expedients
,
such
*NL*
as
applying
to
his
father
or
selling
something
.
But
his
father
would
be
*NL*
deaf
,
and
he
--
he
had
nothing
to
sell
.
Then
he
foresaw
such
worries
that
*NL*
he
quickly
dismissed
so
disagreeable
a
subject
of
meditation
from
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
reproached
himself
with
forgetting
Emma
,
as
if
,
all
his
*NL*
thoughts
belonging
to
this
woman
,
it
was
robbing
her
of
something
not
to
*NL*
be
constantly
thinking
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
was
severe
,
Madame
Bovary
's
convalescence
slow
.
When
it
*NL*
was
fine
they
wheeled
her
arm-chair
to
the
window
that
overlooked
the
*NL*
square
,
for
she
now
had
an
antipathy
to
the
garden
,
and
the
blinds
on
*NL*
that
side
were
always
down
.
She
wished
the
horse
to
be
sold
;
what
she
*NL*
formerly
liked
now
displeased
her
.
All
her
ideas
seemed
to
be
limited
to
*NL*
the
care
of
herself
.
She
stayed
in
bed
taking
little
meals
,
rang
for
the
*NL*
servant
to
inquire
about
her
gruel
or
to
chat
with
her
.
The
snow
on
*NL*
the
market-roof
threw
a
white
,
still
light
into
the
room
;
then
the
rain
*NL*
began
to
fall
;
and
Emma
waited
daily
with
a
mind
full
of
eagerness
for
*NL*
the
inevitable
return
of
some
trifling
events
which
nevertheless
had
no
*NL*
relation
to
her
.
The
most
important
was
the
arrival
of
the
``
Hirondelle
''
*NL*
in
the
evening
.
Then
the
landlady
shouted
out
,
and
other
voices
*NL*
answered
,
while
Hippolyte
's
lantern
,
as
he
fetched
the
boxes
from
the
*NL*
boot
,
was
like
a
star
in
the
darkness
.
At
mid-day
Charles
came
in
;
*NL*
then
he
went
out
again
;
next
she
took
some
beef-tea
,
and
towards
five
*NL*
o'clock
,
as
the
day
drew
in
,
the
children
coming
back
from
school
,
*NL*
dragging
their
wooden
shoes
along
the
pavement
,
knocked
the
clapper
of
*NL*
the
shutters
with
their
rulers
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
hour
that
Monsieur
Bournisien
came
to
see
her
.
He
*NL*
inquired
after
her
health
,
gave
her
news
,
exhorted
her
to
religion
,
in
a
*NL*
coaxing
little
prattle
that
was
not
without
its
charm
.
The
mere
thought
*NL*
of
his
cassock
comforted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
at
the
height
of
her
illness
,
she
had
thought
herself
*NL*
dying
,
and
had
asked
for
the
communion
;
and
,
while
they
were
making
the
*NL*
preparations
in
her
room
for
the
sacrament
,
while
they
were
turning
the
*NL*
night
table
covered
with
syrups
into
an
altar
,
and
while
Felicite
was
*NL*
strewing
dahlia
flowers
on
the
floor
,
Emma
felt
some
power
passing
*NL*
over
her
that
freed
her
from
her
pains
,
from
all
perception
,
from
*NL*
all
feeling
.
Her
body
,
relieved
,
no
longer
thought
;
another
life
was
*NL*
beginning
;
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
being
,
mounting
toward
God
,
would
*NL*
be
annihilated
in
that
love
like
a
burning
incense
that
melts
into
*NL*
vapour
.
The
bed-clothes
were
sprinkled
with
holy
water
,
the
priest
drew
*NL*
from
the
holy
pyx
the
white
wafer
;
and
it
was
fainting
with
a
celestial
*NL*
joy
that
she
put
out
her
lips
to
accept
the
body
of
the
Saviour
*NL*
presented
to
her
.
The
curtains
of
the
alcove
floated
gently
round
her
*NL*
like
clouds
,
and
the
rays
of
the
two
tapers
burning
on
the
night-table
*NL*
seemed
to
shine
like
dazzling
halos
.
Then
she
let
her
head
fall
back
,
*NL*
fancying
she
heard
in
space
the
music
of
seraphic
harps
,
and
perceived
*NL*
in
an
azure
sky
,
on
a
golden
throne
in
the
midst
of
saints
holding
green
*NL*
palms
,
God
the
Father
,
resplendent
with
majesty
,
who
with
a
sign
sent
to
*NL*
earth
angels
with
wings
of
fire
to
carry
her
away
in
their
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
splendid
vision
dwelt
in
her
memory
as
the
most
beautiful
thing
*NL*
that
it
was
possible
to
dream
,
so
that
now
she
strove
to
recall
her
*NL*
sensation
.
That
still
lasted
,
however
,
but
in
a
less
exclusive
fashion
*NL*
and
with
a
deeper
sweetness
.
Her
soul
,
tortured
by
pride
,
at
length
*NL*
found
rest
in
Christian
humility
,
and
,
tasting
the
joy
of
weakness
,
she
*NL*
saw
within
herself
the
destruction
of
her
will
,
that
must
have
left
a
*NL*
wide
entrance
for
the
inroads
of
heavenly
grace
.
There
existed
,
then
,
*NL*
in
the
place
of
happiness
,
still
greater
joys
--
another
love
beyond
all
*NL*
loves
,
without
pause
and
without
end
,
one
that
would
grow
eternally
!
She
*NL*
saw
amid
the
illusions
of
her
hope
a
state
of
purity
floating
above
the
*NL*
earth
mingling
with
heaven
,
to
which
she
aspired
.
She
wanted
to
become
*NL*
a
saint
.
She
bought
chaplets
and
wore
amulets
;
she
wished
to
have
in
her
*NL*
room
,
by
the
side
of
her
bed
,
a
reliquary
set
in
emeralds
that
she
might
*NL*
kiss
it
every
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
marvelled
at
this
humour
,
although
Emma
's
religion
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
might
,
from
its
fervour
,
end
by
touching
on
heresy
,
extravagance
.
But
*NL*
not
being
much
versed
in
these
matters
,
as
soon
as
they
went
beyond
a
*NL*
certain
limit
he
wrote
to
Monsieur
Boulard
,
bookseller
to
Monsignor
,
*NL*
to
send
him
``
something
good
for
a
lady
who
was
very
clever
.
''
The
*NL*
bookseller
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
if
he
had
been
sending
off
*NL*
hardware
to
niggers
,
packed
up
,
pellmell
,
everything
that
was
then
the
*NL*
fashion
in
the
pious
book
trade
.
There
were
little
manuals
in
questions
*NL*
and
answers
,
pamphlets
of
aggressive
tone
after
the
manner
of
Monsieur
*NL*
de
Maistre
,
and
certain
novels
in
rose-coloured
bindings
and
with
*NL*
a
honied
style
,
manufactured
by
troubadour
seminarists
or
penitent
*NL*
blue-stockings
.
There
were
the
``
Think
of
it
;
the
Man
of
the
World
at
*NL*
Mary
's
Feet
,
by
Monsieur
de
***
,
decorated
with
many
Orders
''
;
``
The
*NL*
Errors
of
Voltaire
,
for
the
Use
of
the
Young
,
''
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
's
mind
was
not
yet
sufficiently
clear
to
apply
herself
*NL*
seriously
to
anything
;
moreover
,
she
began
this
reading
in
too
much
*NL*
hurry
.
She
grew
provoked
at
the
doctrines
of
religion
;
the
arrogance
*NL*
of
the
polemic
writings
displeased
her
by
their
inveteracy
in
attacking
*NL*
people
she
did
not
know
;
and
the
secular
stories
,
relieved
with
*NL*
religion
,
seemed
to
her
written
in
such
ignorance
of
the
world
,
that
*NL*
they
insensibly
estranged
her
from
the
truths
for
whose
proof
she
was
*NL*
looking
.
Nevertheless
,
she
persevered
;
and
when
the
volume
slipped
*NL*
from
her
hands
,
she
fancied
herself
seized
with
the
finest
Catholic
*NL*
melancholy
that
an
ethereal
soul
could
conceive
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
memory
of
Rodolphe
,
she
had
thrust
it
back
to
the
bottom
of
*NL*
her
heart
,
and
it
remained
there
more
solemn
and
more
motionless
than
*NL*
a
king
's
mummy
in
a
catacomb
.
An
exhalation
escaped
from
this
embalmed
*NL*
love
,
that
,
penetrating
through
everything
,
perfumed
with
tenderness
the
*NL*
immaculate
atmosphere
in
which
she
longed
to
live
.
When
she
knelt
on
her
*NL*
Gothic
prie-Dieu
,
she
addressed
to
the
Lord
the
same
suave
words
that
*NL*
she
had
murmured
formerly
to
her
lover
in
the
outpourings
of
adultery
.
*NL*
It
was
to
make
faith
come
;
but
no
delights
descended
from
the
heavens
,
*NL*
and
she
arose
with
tired
limbs
and
with
a
vague
feeling
of
a
gigantic
*NL*
dupery
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
searching
after
faith
,
she
thought
,
was
only
one
merit
the
more
,
*NL*
and
in
the
pride
of
her
devoutness
Emma
compared
herself
to
those
grand
*NL*
ladies
of
long
ago
whose
glory
she
had
dreamed
of
over
a
portrait
of
La
*NL*
Valliere
,
and
who
,
trailing
with
so
much
majesty
the
lace-trimmed
trains
*NL*
of
their
long
gowns
,
retired
into
solitudes
to
shed
at
the
feet
of
*NL*
Christ
all
the
tears
of
hearts
that
life
had
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
gave
herself
up
to
excessive
charity
.
She
sewed
clothes
for
the
*NL*
poor
,
she
sent
wood
to
women
in
childbed
;
and
Charles
one
day
,
on
coming
*NL*
home
,
found
three
good-for-nothings
in
the
kitchen
seated
at
the
table
*NL*
eating
soup
.
She
had
her
little
girl
,
whom
during
her
illness
her
*NL*
husband
had
sent
back
to
the
nurse
,
brought
home
.
She
wanted
to
teach
*NL*
her
to
read
;
even
when
Berthe
cried
,
she
was
not
vexed
.
She
had
made
*NL*
up
her
mind
to
resignation
,
to
universal
indulgence
.
Her
language
about
*NL*
everything
was
full
of
ideal
expressions
.
She
said
to
her
child
,
``
Is
*NL*
your
stomach-ache
better
,
my
angel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
senior
found
nothing
to
censure
except
perhaps
this
mania
*NL*
of
knitting
jackets
for
orphans
instead
of
mending
her
own
house-linen
;
*NL*
but
,
harassed
with
domestic
quarrels
,
the
good
woman
took
pleasure
in
*NL*
this
quiet
house
,
and
she
even
stayed
there
till
after
Easter
,
to
escape
*NL*
the
sarcasms
of
old
Bovary
,
who
never
failed
on
Good
Friday
to
order
*NL*
chitterlings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
companionship
of
her
mother-in-law
,
who
strengthened
her
a
*NL*
little
by
the
rectitude
of
her
judgment
and
her
grave
ways
,
Emma
almost
*NL*
every
day
had
other
visitors
.
These
were
Madame
Langlois
,
Madame
Caron
,
*NL*
Madame
Dubreuil
,
Madame
Tuvache
,
and
regularly
from
two
to
five
o'clock
*NL*
the
excellent
Madame
Homais
,
who
,
for
her
part
,
had
never
believed
any
*NL*
of
the
tittle-tattle
about
her
neighbour
.
The
little
Homais
also
came
to
*NL*
see
her
;
Justin
accompanied
them
.
He
went
up
with
them
to
her
bedroom
,
*NL*
and
remained
standing
near
the
door
,
motionless
and
mute
.
Often
even
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
;
taking
no
heed
of
him
,
began
her
toilette
.
She
began
by
*NL*
taking
out
her
comb
,
shaking
her
head
with
a
quick
movement
,
and
when
*NL*
he
for
the
first
time
saw
all
this
mass
of
hair
that
fell
to
her
knees
*NL*
unrolling
in
black
ringlets
,
it
was
to
him
,
poor
child
!
like
a
sudden
*NL*
entrance
into
something
new
and
strange
,
whose
splendour
terrified
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
no
doubt
,
did
not
notice
his
silent
attentions
or
his
timidity
.
*NL*
She
had
no
suspicion
that
the
love
vanished
from
her
life
was
there
,
*NL*
palpitating
by
her
side
,
beneath
that
coarse
holland
shirt
,
in
that
*NL*
youthful
heart
open
to
the
emanations
of
her
beauty
.
Besides
,
she
*NL*
now
enveloped
all
things
with
such
indifference
,
she
had
words
so
*NL*
affectionate
with
looks
so
haughty
,
such
contradictory
ways
,
that
one
*NL*
could
no
longer
distinguish
egotism
from
charity
,
or
corruption
from
*NL*
virtue
.
One
evening
,
for
example
,
she
was
angry
with
the
servant
,
who
*NL*
had
asked
to
go
out
,
and
stammered
as
she
tried
to
find
some
pretext
.
*NL*
Then
suddenly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
love
him
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
waiting
for
any
answer
from
Felicite
,
who
was
blushing
,
she
*NL*
added
,
``
There
!
run
along
;
enjoy
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
beginning
of
spring
she
had
the
garden
turned
up
from
end
to
end
,
*NL*
despite
Bovary
's
remonstrances
.
However
,
he
was
glad
to
see
her
at
last
*NL*
manifest
a
wish
of
any
kind
.
As
she
grew
stronger
she
displayed
more
*NL*
wilfulness
.
First
,
she
found
occasion
to
expel
Mere
Rollet
,
the
nurse
,
*NL*
who
during
her
convalescence
had
contracted
the
habit
of
coming
too
*NL*
often
to
the
kitchen
with
her
two
nurslings
and
her
boarder
,
better
*NL*
off
for
teeth
than
a
cannibal
.
Then
she
got
rid
of
the
Homais
family
,
*NL*
successively
dismissed
all
the
other
visitors
,
and
even
frequented
*NL*
church
less
assiduously
,
to
the
great
approval
of
the
druggist
,
who
said
*NL*
to
her
in
a
friendly
way
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
going
in
a
bit
for
the
cassock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
formerly
,
Monsieur
Bournisien
dropped
in
every
day
when
he
came
out
*NL*
after
catechism
class
.
He
preferred
staying
out
of
doors
to
taking
the
*NL*
air
``
in
the
grove
,
''
as
he
called
the
arbour
.
This
was
the
time
when
*NL*
Charles
came
home
.
They
were
hot
;
some
sweet
cider
was
brought
out
,
and
*NL*
they
drank
together
to
madame
's
complete
restoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Binet
was
there
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
little
lower
down
against
the
terrace
*NL*
wall
,
fishing
for
crayfish
.
Bovary
invited
him
to
have
a
drink
,
and
he
*NL*
thoroughly
understood
the
uncorking
of
the
stone
bottles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
,
''
he
said
,
throwing
a
satisfied
glance
all
round
him
,
even
to
*NL*
the
very
extremity
of
the
landscape
,
``
hold
the
bottle
perpendicularly
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
after
the
strings
are
cut
,
press
up
the
cork
with
*NL*
little
thrusts
,
gently
,
gently
,
as
indeed
they
do
seltzer-water
at
*NL*
restaurants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
during
his
demonstration
the
cider
often
spurted
right
into
their
*NL*
faces
,
and
then
the
ecclesiastic
,
with
a
thick
laugh
,
never
missed
this
*NL*
joke
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Its
goodness
strikes
the
eye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
in
fact
,
a
good
fellow
and
one
day
he
was
not
even
scandalised
*NL*
at
the
chemist
,
who
advised
Charles
to
give
madame
some
distraction
*NL*
by
taking
her
to
the
theatre
at
Rouen
to
hear
the
illustrious
tenor
,
*NL*
Lagardy
.
Homais
,
surprised
at
this
silence
,
wanted
to
know
his
opinion
,
*NL*
and
the
priest
declared
that
he
considered
music
less
dangerous
for
*NL*
morals
than
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
chemist
took
up
the
defence
of
letters
.
The
theatre
,
he
*NL*
contended
,
served
for
railing
at
prejudices
,
and
,
beneath
a
mask
of
*NL*
pleasure
,
taught
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Castigat
ridendo
mores
,
'
*
Monsieur
Bournisien
!
Thus
consider
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
Voltaire
's
tragedies
;
they
are
cleverly
strewn
with
*NL*
philosophical
reflections
,
that
made
them
a
vast
school
of
morals
and
*NL*
diplomacy
for
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
It
corrects
customs
through
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Binet
,
``
once
saw
a
piece
called
the
`
Gamin
de
Paris
,
'
in
which
*NL*
there
was
the
character
of
an
old
general
that
is
really
hit
off
to
a
*NL*
T
.
He
sets
down
a
young
swell
who
had
seduced
a
working
girl
,
who
at
the
*NL*
ending
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
continued
Homais
,
``
there
is
bad
literature
as
there
is
bad
*NL*
pharmacy
,
but
to
condemn
in
a
lump
the
most
important
of
the
fine
arts
*NL*
seems
to
me
a
stupidity
,
a
Gothic
idea
,
worthy
of
the
abominable
times
*NL*
that
imprisoned
Galileo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
very
well
,
''
objected
the
cure
,
``
that
there
are
good
works
,
*NL*
good
authors
.
However
,
if
it
were
only
those
persons
of
different
sexes
*NL*
united
in
a
bewitching
apartment
,
decorated
rouge
,
those
lights
,
those
*NL*
effeminate
voices
,
all
this
must
,
in
the
long-run
,
engender
a
*NL*
certain
mental
libertinage
,
give
rise
to
immodest
thoughts
and
impure
*NL*
temptations
.
Such
,
at
any
rate
,
is
the
opinion
of
all
the
Fathers
.
*NL*
Finally
,
''
he
added
,
suddenly
assuming
a
mystic
tone
of
voice
while
*NL*
he
rolled
a
pinch
of
snuff
between
his
fingers
,
``
if
the
Church
has
*NL*
condemned
the
theatre
,
she
must
be
right
;
we
must
submit
to
her
*NL*
decrees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
asked
the
druggist
,
``
should
she
excommunicate
actors
?
For
*NL*
formerly
they
openly
took
part
in
religious
ceremonies
.
Yes
,
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
chancel
they
acted
;
they
performed
a
kind
of
farce
called
*NL*
`
Mysteries
,
'
which
often
offended
against
the
laws
of
decency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ecclesiastic
contented
himself
with
uttering
a
groan
,
and
the
*NL*
chemist
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
it
is
in
the
Bible
;
there
there
are
,
you
know
,
more
than
one
*NL*
piquant
detail
,
matters
really
libidinous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
a
gesture
of
irritation
from
Monsieur
Bournisien
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
'll
admit
that
it
is
not
a
book
to
place

hands
of

girl
,
and
I
should
be
sorry
if
Athalie

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
the
Protestants

cried
the
other
impatiently
,
*NL*
``
who
recommend
the
Bible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter

said
Homais
.
``
I
am
surprised
that
in
our
days

in
this

century
of
enlightenment

anyone
should
still
persist
in
proscribing
an
*NL*
intellectual
relaxation
that
is
inoffensive
,
moralising
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
even
hygienic
;
is
it
not

doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt

''
replied
the
doctor
carelessly
,
either
because
,
sharing
the
*NL*
same
ideas
,
he
wished
to
offend
no
one
,
or
else
because
he
had
not
any
*NL*
ideas

*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
seemed
at
an
end
when
the
chemist
thought
fit
to
shoot
*NL*
a
Parthian
arrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
known
priests

put
on
ordinary

``

``
Ah

And
separating
the
words
of
his
sentence
,
Homais
*NL*
repeated
,
``
I

have

known

some

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Bournisien

resigned
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
!
they
go
in
for
more
than
that

exclaimed
the
druggist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
replied
the
ecclesiastic
,
with
such
angry
eyes
that
the
druggist
*NL*
was
intimidated
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
mean
to
say
,
''
he
replied
in
less
brutal
a
tone
,
``
that
toleration
*NL*
is
the
surest
way
to
draw
people
to
religion

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

true

that
is
true

''
agreed
the
good
fellow
,
sitting
down
again
*NL*
on
his
chair
.
But
he
stayed
only
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
,
Monsieur
Homais
said
to
the
doctor
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
call
a
cock-fight

I
beat

you
see

in

Now
take
my
advice

Take
madame
to
the
theatre
,
if
it
were
only
*NL*
for
once
in
your
life
,
to
enrage
one
of

it

If
anyone
*NL*
could
take
my
place

I
would
accompany

myself

Be
quick

*NL*
Lagardy
is
only
going
to
give
one
performance
;
he
's
engaged
to
go
to
*NL*
England
at
a
high
salary
.
From
what
I
hear
,
he
's
a
regular
dog
;
he
's
*NL*
rolling
in
money
;
he
's
taking
three
mistresses
and
a
cook
along
with
*NL*
him
.
All
these
great
artists
burn
the
candle
at
both
ends
;
they
require
*NL*
a
dissolute
life
,
that
suits
the
imagination
to
some
extent
.
But
they
*NL*
die
at
the
hospital
,
because
they
have
n't
the
sense
when
young
to
lay
*NL*
by

Well

a
pleasant
dinner

Goodbye
till

The
idea
of
the
theatre
quickly
germinated
in
Bovary
's
head
,
for
he
at
*NL*
once
communicated
it
to
his
wife
,
who
at
first
refused
,
alleging
the
*NL*
fatigue
,
the
worry
,
the
expense
;
but
,
for
a
wonder
,
Charles
did
not
give
*NL*
in
,
so
sure
was
he
that
this
recreation
would
be
good
for
her
.
He
saw
*NL*
nothing
to
prevent
it
:
his
mother
had
sent
them
three
hundred
francs
*NL*
which
he
had
no
longer
expected
;
the
current
debts
were
not
very
large
,
*NL*
and
the
falling
in
of
Lheureux
's
bills
was
still
so
far
off
that
*NL*
there
was
no
need
to
think
about
them
.
Besides
,
imagining
that
she
*NL*
was
refusing
from
delicacy
,
he
insisted
the
more
;
so
that
by
dint
of
*NL*
worrying
her
she
at
last
made
up
her
mind
,
and
the
next
day
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
they
set
out
in
the
``
Hirondelle

The
druggist
,
whom
nothing
whatever
kept
at
Yonville
,
but
who
thought
*NL*
himself
bound
not
to
budge
from
it
,
sighed
as
he
saw
them
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
pleasant
journey
!
''
he
said
to
them
;
``
happy
mortals
that
you
*NL*
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
addressing
himself
to
Emma
,
who
was
wearing
a
blue
silk
gown
with
*NL*
four
flounces
--

The
diligence
stopped
at
the
``
Croix-Rouge
''
in
the
Place
Beauvoisine
.
It
*NL*
was
the
inn
that
is
in
every
provincial
faubourg
,
with
large
stables
*NL*
and
small
bedrooms
,
where
one
sees
in
the
middle
of
the
court
chickens
*NL*
pilfering
the
oats
under
the
muddy
gigs
of
the
commercial
travellers
--
a
*NL*
good
old
house
,
with
worm-eaten
balconies
that
creak
in
the
wind
on
*NL*
winter
nights
,
always
full
of
people
,
noise
,
and
feeding
,
whose
black
*NL*
tables
are
sticky
with
coffee
and
brandy
,
the
thick
windows
made
yellow
*NL*
by
the
flies
,
the
damp
napkins
stained
with
cheap
wine
,
and
that
always
*NL*
smells
of
the
village
,
like
ploughboys
dressed
in
Sundayclothes
,
has
*NL*
a
cafe
on
the
street

and
towards
the
countryside
a

*NL*
Charles
at
once
set
out
.
He
muddled
up
the
stage-boxes
with
the
gallery
,
*NL*
the
pit
with
the
boxes
;
asked
for
explanations
,
did
not
understand
them
;
*NL*
was
sent
from
the
box-office
to
the
acting-manager
;
came
back
to
the
*NL*
inn
,
returned
to
the
theatre
,
and
thus
several
times
traversed
the
whole
*NL*
length
of
the
town
from
the
theatre
to
the
boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
bought
a
bonnet
,
gloves
,
and
a
bouquet
.
The
doctor
was
*NL*
much
afraid
of
missing
the
beginning
,
and
,
without
having
had
time
to
*NL*
swallow
a
plate
of
soup
,
they
presented
themselves
at
the
doors
of
the
*NL*
theatre
,
which
were
still
closed
.

The
crowd
was
waiting
against
the
wall
,
symmetrically
enclosed
between
*NL*
the
balustrades
.
At
the
corner
of
the
neighbouring
streets
huge
bills
*NL*
repeated
in
quaint
letters
``
Lucie
de
Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc
.
''
The
*NL*
weather
was
fine
,
the
people
were
hot
,
perspiration
trickled
amid
the
*NL*
curls
,
and
handkerchiefs
taken
from
pockets
were
mopping
red
foreheads
;
*NL*
and
now
and
then
a
warm
wind
that
blew
from
the
river
gently
stirred
the
*NL*
border
of
the
tick
awnings
hanging
from
the
doors
of
the
public-houses
.
*NL*
A
little
lower
down
,
however
,
one
was
refreshed
by
a
current
of
icy
air
*NL*
that
smelt
of
tallow
,
leather
,
and
oil
.
This
was
an
exhalation
from
*NL*
the
Rue
des
Charrettes
,
full
of
large
black
warehouses
where
they
made
*NL*
casks
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
fear
of
seeming
ridiculous
,
Emma
before
going
in
wished
to
have
a
*NL*
little
stroll
in
the
harbour
,
and
Bovary
prudently
kept
his
tickets
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
in
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
,
which
he
pressed
against
his
*NL*
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
heart
began
to
beat
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
vestibule
.
She
*NL*
involuntarily
smiled
with
vanity
on
seeing
the
crowd
rushing
to
the
*NL*
right
by
the
other
corridor
while
she
went
up
the
staircase
to
the
*NL*
reserved
seats
.
She
was
as
pleased
as
a
child
to
push
with
her
finger
*NL*
the
large
tapestried
door
.
She
breathed
in
with
all
her
might
the
*NL*
dusty
smell
of
the
lobbies
,
and
when
she
was
seated
in
her
box
she
bent
*NL*
forward
with
the
air
of
a
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theatre
was
beginning
to
fill
;
opera-glasses
were
taken
from
their
*NL*
cases
,
and
the
subscribers
,
catching
sight
of
one
another
,
were
bowing
.
*NL*
They
came
to
seek
relaxation
in
the
fine
arts
after
the
anxieties
of
*NL*
business
;
but
``
business
''
was
not
forgotten
;
they
still
talked
cottons
,
*NL*
spirits
of
wine
,
or
indigo
.
The
heads
of
old
men
were
to
be
seen
,
*NL*
inexpressive
and
peaceful
,
with
their
hair
and
complexions
looking
like
*NL*
silver
medals
tarnished
by
steam
of
lead
.
The
young
beaux
were
strutting
*NL*
about
in
the
pit
,
showing
in
the
opening
of
their
waistcoats
their
pink
*NL*
or
applegreen
cravats
,
and
Madame
Bovary
from
above
admired
them
leaning
*NL*
on
their
canes
with
golden
knobs
in
the
open
palm
of
their
yellow
*NL*
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
lights
of
the
orchestra
were
lit
,
the
lustre
,
let
down
from
the
*NL*
ceiling
,
throwing
by
the
glimmering
of
its
facets
a
sudden
gaiety
over
*NL*
the
theatre
;
then
the
musicians
came
in
one
after
the
other
;
and
*NL*
first
there
was
the
protracted
hubbub
of
the
basses
grumbling
,
violins
*NL*
squeaking
,
cornets
trumpeting
,
flutes
and
flageolets
fifing
.
But
three
*NL*
knocks
were
heard
on
the
stage
,
a
rolling
of
drums
began
,
the
brass
*NL*
instruments
played
some
chords
,
and
the
curtain
rising
,
discovered
a
*NL*
country-scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
cross-roads
of
a
wood
,
with
a
fountain
shaded
by
an
oak
to
*NL*
the
left
.
Peasants
and
lords
with
plaids
on
their
shoulders
were
singing
*NL*
a
hunting-song
together
;
then
a
captain
suddenly
came
on
,
who
evoked
*NL*
the
spirit
of
evil
by
lifting
both
his
arms
to
heaven
.
Another
appeared
;
*NL*
they
went
away
,
and
the
hunters
started
afresh
.
She
felt
herself
*NL*
transported
to
the
reading
of
her
youth
,
into
the
midst
of
Walter
Scott
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
hear
through
the
mist
the
sound
of
the
Scotch
bagpipes
*NL*
re-echoing
over
the
heather
.
Then
her
remembrance
of
the
novel
helping
*NL*
her
to
understand
the
libretto
,
she
followed
the
story
phrase
by
phrase
,
*NL*
while
vague
thoughts
that
came
back
to
her
dispersed
at
once
again
with
*NL*
the
bursts
of
music
.
She
gave
herself
up
to
the
lullaby
of
the
melodies
,
*NL*
and
felt
all
her
being
vibrate
as
if
the
violin
bows
were
drawn
over
her
*NL*
nerves
.
She
had
not
eyes
enough
to
look
at
the
costumes
,
the
scenery
,
*NL*
the
actors
,
the
painted
trees
that
shook
when
anyone
walked
,
and
the
*NL*
velvet
caps
,
cloaks
,
swords
--
all
those
imaginary
things
that
floated
*NL*
amid
the
harmony
as
in
the
atmosphere
of
another
world
.
But
a
young
*NL*
woman
stepped
forward
,
throwing
a
purse
to
a
squire
in
green
.
She
was
*NL*
left
alone
,
and
the
flute
was
heard
like
the
murmur
of
a
fountain
or
the
*NL*
warbling
of
birds
.
Lucie
attacked
her
cavatina
in
G
major
bravely
.
She
*NL*
plained
of
love
;
she
longed
for
wings
.
Emma
,
too
,
fleeing
from
life
,
*NL*
would
have
liked
to
fly
away
in
an
embrace
.
Suddenly
Edgar-Lagardy
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
that
splendid
pallor
that
gives
something
of
the
majesty
of
*NL*
marble
to
the
ardent
races
of
the
South
.
His
vigorous
form
was
tightly
*NL*
clad
in
a
brown-coloured
doublet
;
a
small
chiselled
poniard
hung
against
*NL*
his
left
thigh
,
and
he
cast
round
laughing
looks
showing
his
white
*NL*
teeth
.
They
said
that
a
Polish
princess
having
heard
him
sing
one
night
*NL*
on
the
beach
at
Biarritz
,
where
he
mended
boats
,
had
fallen
in
love
*NL*
with
him
.
She
had
ruined
herself
for
him
.
He
had
deserted
her
for
*NL*
other
women
,
and
this
sentimental
celebrity
did
not
fail
to
enhance
his
*NL*
artistic
reputation
.
The
diplomatic
mummer
took
care
always
to
slip
into
*NL*
his
advertisements
some
poetic
phrase
on
the
fascination
of
his
*NL*
person
and
the
susceptibility
of
his
soul
.
A
fine
organ
,
imperturbable
*NL*
coolness
,
more
temperament
than
intelligence
,
more
power
of
emphasis
*NL*
than
of
real
singing
,
made
up
the
charm
of
this
admirable
charlatan
*NL*
nature
,
in
which
there
was
something
of
the
hairdresser
and
the
*NL*
toreador
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
first
scene
he
evoked
enthusiasm
.
He
pressed
Lucy
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
he
left
her
,
he
came
back
,
he
seemed
desperate
;
he
had
outbursts
of
*NL*
rage
,
then
elegiac
gurglings
of
infinite
sweetness
,
and
the
notes
*NL*
escaped
from
his
bare
neck
full
of
sobs
and
kisses
.
Emma
leant
forward
*NL*
to
see
him
,
clutching
the
velvet
of
the
box
with
her
nails
.
She
was
*NL*
filling
her
heart
with
these
melodious
lamentations
that
were
drawn
*NL*
out
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
double-basses
,
like
the
cries
of
the
*NL*
drowning
in
the
tumult
of
a
tempest
.
She
recognised
all
the
intoxication
*NL*
and
the
anguish
that
had
almost
killed
her
.
The
voice
of
a
prima
donna
*NL*
seemed
to
her
to
be
but
echoes
of
her
conscience
,
and
this
illusion
that
*NL*
charmed
her
as
some
very
thing
of
her
own
life
.
But
no
one
on
earth
had
*NL*
loved
her
with
such
love
.
He
had
not
wept
like
Edgar
that
last
moonlit
*NL*
night
when
they
said
,
``
To-morrow
!
to-morrow
!
''
The
theatre
rang
with
*NL*
cheers
;
they
recommenced
the
entire
movement
;
the
lovers
spoke
of
*NL*
the
flowers
on
their
tomb
,
of
vows
,
exile
,
fate
,
hopes
;
and
when
they
*NL*
uttered
the
final
adieu
,
Emma
gave
a
sharp
cry
that
mingled
with
the
*NL*
vibrations
of
the
last
chords
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
''
asked
Bovary
,
``
does
that
gentleman
persecute
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
she
answered
;
``
he
is
her
lover
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
he
vows
vengeance
on
her
family
,
while
the
other
one
who
came
on
*NL*
before
said
,
'
I
love
Lucie
and
she
loves
me
!
'
Besides
,
he
went
off
with
*NL*
her
father
arm
in
arm
.
For
he
certainly
is
her
father
,
is
n't
he
--
the
*NL*
ugly
little
man
with
a
cock
's
feather
in
his
hat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
Emma
's
explanations
,
as
soon
as
the
recitative
duet
began
*NL*
in
which
Gilbert
lays
bare
his
abominable
machinations
to
his
master
*NL*
Ashton
,
Charles
,
seeing
the
false
troth-ring
that
is
to
deceive
Lucie
,
*NL*
thought
it
was
a
love-gift
sent
by
Edgar
.
He
confessed
,
moreover
,
that
*NL*
he
did
not
understand
the
story
because
of
the
music
,
which
interfered
*NL*
very
much
with
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
?
''
said
Emma
.
``
Do
be
quiet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
know
,
''
he
went
on
,
leaning
against
her
shoulder
,
``
I
like
*NL*
to
understand
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
!
be
quiet
!
''
she
cried
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucie
advanced
,
half
supported
by
her
women
,
a
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
*NL*
in
her
hair
,
and
paler
than
the
white
satin
of
her
gown
.
Emma
dreamed
*NL*
of
her
marriage
day
;
she
saw
herself
at
home
again
amid
the
corn
in
the
*NL*
little
path
as
they
walked
to
the
church
.
Oh
,
why
had
not
she
,
like
*NL*
this
woman
,
resisted
,
implored
?
She
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
joyous
,
*NL*
without
seeing
the
abyss
into
which
she
was
throwing
herself
.
Ah
!
if
*NL*
in
the
freshness
of
her
beauty
,
before
the
soiling
of
marriage
and
the
*NL*
disillusions
of
adultery
,
she
could
have
anchored
her
life
upon
some
*NL*
great
,
strong
heart
,
then
virtue
,
tenderness
,
voluptuousness
,
and
duty
*NL*
blending
,
she
would
never
have
fallen
from
so
high
a
happiness
.
But
that
*NL*
happiness
,
no
doubt
,
was
a
lie
invented
for
the
despair
of
all
desire
.
*NL*
She
now
knew
the
smallness
of
the
passions
that
art
exaggerated
.
So
,
*NL*
striving
to
divert
her
thoughts
,
Emma
determined
now
to
see
in
this
*NL*
reproduction
of
her
sorrows
only
a
plastic
fantasy
,
well
enough
to
*NL*
please
the
eye
,
and
she
even
smiled
internally
with
disdainful
pity
when
*NL*
at
the
back
of
the
stage
under
the
velvet
hangings
a
man
appeared
in
a
*NL*
black
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
large
Spanish
hat
fell
at
a
gesture
he
made
,
and
immediately
the
*NL*
instruments
and
the
singers
began
the
sextet
.
Edgar
,
flashing
with
fury
,
*NL*
dominated
all
the
others
with
his
clearer
voice
;
Ashton
hurled
homicidal
*NL*
provocations
at
him
in
deep
notes
;
Lucie
uttered
her
shrill
plaint
,
*NL*
Arthur
at
one
side
,
his
modulated
tones
in
the
middle
register
,
and
the
*NL*
bass
of
the
minister
pealed
forth
like
an
organ
,
while
the
voices
of
the
*NL*
women
repeating
his
words
took
them
up
in
chorus
delightfully
.
They
were
*NL*
all
in
a
row
gesticulating
,
and
anger
,
vengeance
,
jealousy
,
terror
,
and
*NL*
stupefaction
breathed
forth
at
once
from
their
half-opened
mouths
.
The
*NL*
outraged
lover
brandished
his
naked
sword
;
his
guipure
ruffle
rose
with
*NL*
jerks
to
the
movements
of
his
chest
,
and
he
walked
from
right
to
left
*NL*
with
long
strides
,
clanking
against
the
boards
the
silver-gilt
spurs
of
*NL*
his
soft
boots
,
widening
out
at
the
ankles
.
He
,
she
thought
must
have
an
*NL*
inexhaustible
love
to
lavish
it
upon
the
crowd
with
such
effusion
.
*NL*
All
her
small
fault-findings
faded
before
the
poetry
of
the
part
*NL*
that
absorbed
her
;
and
,
drawn
towards
this
man
by
the
illusion
of
the
*NL*
character
,
she
tried
to
imagine
to
herself
his
life
--
that
life
resonant
,
*NL*
extraordinary
,
splendid
,
and
that
might
have
been
hers
if
fate
had
*NL*
willed
it
.
They
would
have
known
one
another
,
loved
one
another
.
With
*NL*
him
,
through
all
the
kingdoms
of
Europe
she
would
have
travelled
from
*NL*
capital
to
capital
,
sharing
his
fatigues
and
his
pride
,
picking
up
the
*NL*
flowers
thrown
to
him
,
herself
embroidering
his
costumes
.
Then
each
*NL*
evening
,
at
the
back
of
a
box
,
behind
the
golden
trellis-work
she
would
*NL*
have
drunk
in
eagerly
the
expansions
of
this
soul
that
would
have
sung
*NL*
for
her
alone
;
from
the
stage
,
even
as
he
acted
,
he
would
have
looked
*NL*
at
her
.
But
the
mad
idea
seized
her
that
he
was
looking
at
her
;
it
was
*NL*
certain
.
She
longed
to
run
to
his
arms
,
to
take
refuge
in
his
strength
,
*NL*
as
in
the
incarnation
of
love
itself
,
and
to
say
to
him
,
to
cry
out
,
*NL*
``
Take
me
away
!
carry
me
with
you
!
let
us
go
!
Thine
,
thine
!
all
my
ardour
*NL*
and
all
my
dreams
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtain
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smell
of
the
gas
mingled
with
that
of
the
breaths
,
the
waving
of
the
*NL*
fans
,
made
the
air
more
suffocating
.
Emma
wanted
to
go
out
;
the
*NL*
crowd
filled
the
corridors
,
and
she
fell
back
in
her
arm-chair
with
*NL*
palpitations
that
choked
her
.
Charles
,
fearing
that
she
would
faint
,
ran
*NL*
to
the
refreshment-room
to
get
a
glass
of
barley-water
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
back
to
his
seat
,
for
his
elbows
were
*NL*
jerked
at
every
step
because
of
the
glass
he
held
in
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
he
even
spilt
three-fourths
on
the
shoulders
of
a
Rouen
lady
in
short
*NL*
sleeves
,
who
feeling
the
cold
liquid
running
down
to
her
loins
,
uttered
*NL*
cries
like
a
peacock
,
as
if
she
were
being
assassinated
.
Her
husband
,
*NL*
who
was
a
millowner
,
railed
at
the
clumsy
fellow
,
and
while
she
was
with
*NL*
her
handkerchief
wiping
up
the
stains
from
her
handsome
cherry-coloured
*NL*
taffeta
gown
,
he
angrily
muttered
about
indemnity
,
costs
,
reimbursement
.
*NL*
At
last
Charles
reached
his
wife
,
saying
to
her
,
quite
out
of
breath
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
!
I
thought
I
should
have
had
to
stay
there
.
There
is
such
a
*NL*
crowd
--
SUCH
a
crowd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
guess
whom
I
met
up
there
!
Monsieur
Leon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Himself
!
He
's
coming
along
to
pay
his
respects
.
''
And
as
he
finished
*NL*
these
words
the
ex-clerk
of
Yonville
entered
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
with
the
ease
of
a
gentleman
;
and
Madame
Bovary
*NL*
extended
hers
,
without
doubt
obeying
the
attraction
of
a
stronger
will
.
*NL*
She
had
not
felt
it
since
that
spring
evening
when
the
rain
fell
upon
*NL*
the
green
leaves
,
and
they
had
said
good-bye
standing
at
the
window
.
*NL*
But
soon
recalling
herself
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation
,
with
an
*NL*
effort
she
shook
off
the
torpor
of
her
memories
,
and
began
stammering
a
*NL*
few
hurried
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good-day
!
What
!
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
cried
a
voice
from
the
pit
,
for
the
third
act
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
at
Rouen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
since
when
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
them
out
!
turn
them
out
!
''
People
were
looking
at
them
.
They
were
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
from
that
moment
she
listened
no
more
;
and
the
chorus
of
the
guests
,
*NL*
the
scene
between
Ashton
and
his
servant
,
the
grand
duet
in
D
major
,
all
*NL*
were
for
her
as
far
off
as
if
the
instruments
had
grown
less
sonorous
*NL*
and
the
characters
more
remote
.
She
remembered
the
games
at
cards
at
the
*NL*
druggist
's
,
and
the
walk
to
the
nurse
's
,
the
reading
in
the
arbour
,
*NL*
the
tete-a-tete
by
the
fireside
--
all
that
poor
love
,
so
calm
and
so
*NL*
protracted
,
so
discreet
,
so
tender
,
and
that
she
had
nevertheless
*NL*
forgotten
.
And
why
had
he
come
back
?
What
combination
of
circumstances
*NL*
had
brought
him
back
into
her
life
?
He
was
standing
behind
her
,
leaning
*NL*
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
of
the
box
;
now
and
again
she
felt
*NL*
herself
shuddering
beneath
the
hot
breath
from
his
nostrils
falling
upon
*NL*
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
this
amuse
you
?
''
said
he
,
bending
over
her
so
closely
that
the
end
*NL*
of
his
moustache
brushed
her
cheek
.
She
replied
carelessly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
no
,
not
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
proposed
that
they
should
leave
the
theatre
and
go
and
take
an
*NL*
ice
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
yet
;
let
us
stay
,
''
said
Bovary
.
``
Her
hair
's
undone
;
this
is
*NL*
going
to
be
tragic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
mad
scene
did
not
at
all
interest
Emma
,
and
the
acting
of
the
*NL*
singer
seemed
to
her
exaggerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
screams
too
loud
,
''
said
she
,
turning
to
Charles
,
who
was
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
a
little
,
''
he
replied
,
undecided
between
the
frankness
of
his
*NL*
pleasure
and
his
respect
for
his
wife
's
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
with
a
sigh
Leon
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heat
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unbearable
!
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
unwell
?
''
asked
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
stifling
;
let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Leon
put
her
long
lace
shawl
carefully
about
her
shoulders
,
and
*NL*
all
three
went
off
to
sit
down
in
the
harbour
,
in
the
open
air
,
outside
*NL*
the
windows
of
a
cafe
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
they
spoke
of
her
illness
,
although
Emma
interrupted
Charles
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
for
fear
,
she
said
,
of
boring
Monsieur
Leon
;
and
the
*NL*
latter
told
them
that
he
had
come
to
spend
two
years
at
Rouen
in
a
large
*NL*
office
,
in
order
to
get
practice
in
his
profession
,
which
was
different
*NL*
in
Normandy
and
Paris
.
Then
he
inquired
after
Berthe
,
the
Homais
,
Mere
*NL*
Lefrancois
,
and
as
they
had
,
in
the
husband
's
presence
,
nothing
more
to
*NL*
say
to
one
another
,
the
conversation
soon
came
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
coming
out
of
the
theatre
passed
along
the
pavement
,
humming
or
*NL*
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
,
``
O
bel
ange
,
ma
Lucie
!
*
''
Then
Leon
,
*NL*
playing
the
dilettante
,
began
to
talk
music
.
He
had
seen
Tambourini
,
*NL*
Rubini
,
Persiani
,
Grisi
,
and
,
compared
with
them
,
Lagardy
,
despite
his
*NL*
grand
outbursts
,
was
nowhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Oh
beautiful
angel
,
my
Lucie
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
interrupted
Charles
,
who
was
slowly
sipping
his
rum-sherbet
,
*NL*
``
they
say
that
he
is
quite
admirable
in
the
last
act
.
I
regret
leaving
*NL*
before
the
end
,
because
it
was
beginning
to
amuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
``
he
will
soon
give
another
performance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Charles
replied
that
they
were
going
back
next
day
.
``
Unless
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
``
you
would
like
to
stay
alone
,
kitten
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
changing
his
tactics
at
this
unexpected
opportunity
that
presented
*NL*
itself
to
his
hopes
,
the
young
man
sang
the
praises
of
Lagardy
in
the
*NL*
last
number
.
It
was
really
superb
,
sublime
.
Then
Charles
insisted
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
get
back
on
Sunday
.
Come
,
make
up
your
mind
.
You
are
wrong
if
*NL*
you
feel
that
this
is
doing
you
the
least
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tables
round
them
,
however
,
were
emptying
;
a
waiter
came
and
stood
*NL*
discreetly
near
them
.
Charles
,
who
understood
,
took
out
his
purse
;
the
*NL*
clerk
held
back
his
arm
,
and
did
not
forget
to
leave
two
more
pieces
of
*NL*
silver
that
he
made
chink
on
the
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
really
sorry
,
''
said
Bovary
,
``
about
the
money
which
you
are
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
made
a
careless
gesture
full
of
cordiality
,
and
taking
his
hat
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
settled
,
is
n't
it
?
To-morrow
at
six
o'clock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
explained
once
more
that
he
could
not
absent
himself
longer
,
but
*NL*
that
nothing
prevented
Emma
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
she
stammered
,
with
a
strange
smile
,
``
I
am
not
sure
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
think
it
over
.
We
'll
see
.
Night
brings
counsel
.
''
Then
to
*NL*
Leon
,
who
was
walking
along
with
them
,
``
Now
that
you
are
in
our
part
of
*NL*
the
world
,
I
hope
you
'll
come
and
ask
us
for
some
dinner
now
and
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
declared
he
would
not
fail
to
do
so
,
being
obliged
,
moreover
,
*NL*
to
go
to
Yonville
on
some
business
for
his
office
.
And
they
parted
*NL*
before
the
Saint-Herbland
Passage
just
as
the
clock
in
the
cathedral
*NL*
struck
half-past
eleven
.

Part
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
One
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Leon
,
while
studying
law
,
had
gone
pretty
often
to
the
*NL*
dancing-rooms
,
where
he
was
even
a
great
success
amongst
the
grisettes
,
*NL*
who
thought
he
had
a
distinguished
air
.
He
was
the
best-mannered
of
the
*NL*
students
;
he
wore
his
hair
neither
too
long
nor
too
short
,
did
n't
spend
*NL*
all
his
quarter
's
money
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
,
and
kept
on
good
*NL*
terms
with
his
professors
.
As
for
excesses
,
he
had
always
abstained
from
*NL*
them
,
as
much
from
cowardice
as
from
refinement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
when
he
stayed
in
his
room
to
read
,
or
else
when
sitting
of
an
*NL*
evening
under
the
lime-trees
of
the
Luxembourg
,
he
let
his
Code
fall
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
the
memory
of
Emma
came
back
to
him
.
But
gradually
this
*NL*
feeling
grew
weaker
,
and
other
desires
gathered
over
it
,
although
it
*NL*
still
persisted
through
them
all
.
For
Leon
did
not
lose
all
hope
;
there
*NL*
was
for
him
,
as
it
were
,
a
vague
promise
floating
in
the
future
,
like
a
*NL*
golden
fruit
suspended
from
some
fantastic
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
seeing
her
again
after
three
years
of
absence
his
passion
*NL*
reawakened
.
He
must
,
he
thought
,
at
last
make
up
his
mind
to
possess
*NL*
her
.
Moreover
,
his
timidity
had
worn
off
by
contact
with
his
gay
*NL*
companions
,
and
he
returned
to
the
provinces
despising
everyone
who
had
*NL*
not
with
varnished
shoes
trodden
the
asphalt
of
the
boulevards
.
By
*NL*
the
side
of
a
Parisienne
in
her
laces
,
in
the
drawing-room
of
some
*NL*
illustrious
physician
,
a
person
driving
his
carriage
and
wearing
many
*NL*
orders
,
the
poor
clerk
would
no
doubt
have
trembled
like
a
child
;
but
*NL*
here
,
at
Rouen
,
on
the
harbour
,
with
the
wife
of
this
small
doctor
*NL*
he
felt
at
his
ease
,
sure
beforehand
he
would
shine
.
Self-possession
*NL*
depends
on
its
environment
.
We
do
n't
speak
on
the
first
floor
as
on
the
*NL*
fourth
;
and
the
wealthy
woman
seems
to
have
,
about
her
,
to
guard
her
*NL*
virtue
,
all
her
banknotes
,
like
a
cuirass
in
the
lining
of
her
corset
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
Bovarys
the
night
before
,
Leon
had
followed
them
*NL*
through
the
streets
at
a
distance
;
then
having
seen
them
stop
at
the
*NL*
``
Croix-Rouge
,
''
he
turned
on
his
heel
,
and
spent
the
night
meditating
a
*NL*
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
next
day
about
five
o'clock
he
walked
into
the
kitchen
of
the
*NL*
inn
,
with
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
,
pale
cheeks
,
and
that
*NL*
resolution
of
cowards
that
stops
at
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
is
n't
in
,
''
answered
a
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
him
a
good
omen
.
He
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
disturbed
at
his
approach
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
apologised
*NL*
for
having
neglected
to
tell
him
where
they
were
staying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
divined
it
!
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pretended
he
had
been
guided
towards
her
by
chance
,
by
,
instinct
.
She
*NL*
began
to
smile
;
and
at
once
,
to
repair
his
folly
,
Leon
told
her
that
he
*NL*
had
spent
his
morning
in
looking
for
her
in
all
the
hotels
in
the
town
*NL*
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
stay
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
I
am
wrong
.
One
ought
not
to
accustom
oneself
to
*NL*
impossible
pleasures
when
there
are
a
thousand
demands
upon
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
imagine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
no
;
for
you
,
you
are
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
men
too
had
had
their
trials
,
and
the
conversation
went
off
into
*NL*
certain
philosophical
reflections
.
Emma
expatiated
much
on
the
misery
of
*NL*
earthly
affections
,
and
the
eternal
isolation
in
which
the
heart
remains
*NL*
entombed
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
show
off
,
or
from
a
naive
imitation
of
this
melancholy
which
called
*NL*
forth
his
,
the
young
man
declared
that
he
had
been
awfully
bored
during
*NL*
the
whole
course
of
his
studies
.
The
law
irritated
him
,
other
vocations
*NL*
attracted
him
,
and
his
mother
never
ceased
worrying
him
in
every
one
*NL*
of
her
letters
.
As
they
talked
they
explained
more
and
more
fully
the
*NL*
motives
of
their
sadness
,
working
themselves
up
in
their
progressive
*NL*
confidence
.
But
they
sometimes
stopped
short
of
the
complete
exposition
*NL*
of
their
thought
,
and
then
sought
to
invent
a
phrase
that
might
express
*NL*
it
all
the
same
.
She
did
not
confess
her
passion
for
another
;
he
did
not
*NL*
say
that
he
had
forgotten
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
he
no
longer
remembered
his
suppers
with
girls
after
masked
*NL*
balls
;
and
no
doubt
she
did
not
recollect
the
rendezvous
of
old
when
she
*NL*
ran
across
the
fields
in
the
morning
to
her
lover
's
house
.
The
noises
*NL*
of
the
town
hardly
reached
them
,
and
the
room
seemed
small
,
as
if
*NL*
on
purpose
to
hem
in
their
solitude
more
closely
.
Emma
,
in
a
dimity
*NL*
dressing-gown
,
leant
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
old
arm-chair
;
the
*NL*
yellow
wall-paper
formed
,
as
it
were
,
a
golden
background
behind
her
,
*NL*
and
her
bare
head
was
mirrored
in
the
glass
with
the
white
parting
in
*NL*
the
middle
,
and
the
tip
of
her
ears
peeping
out
from
the
folds
of
her
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
pardon
me
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
is
wrong
of
me
.
I
weary
you
with
my
*NL*
eternal
complaints
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
never
,
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
knew
,
''
she
went
on
,
raising
to
the
ceiling
her
beautiful
eyes
,
*NL*
in
which
a
tear
was
trembling
,
``
all
that
I
had
dreamed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
!
Oh
,
I
too
have
suffered
!
Often
I
went
out
;
I
went
away
.
I
*NL*
dragged
myself
along
the
quays
,
seeking
distraction
amid
the
din
of
the
*NL*
crowd
without
being
able
to
banish
the
heaviness
that
weighed
upon
me
.
*NL*
In
an
engraver
's
shop
on
the
boulevard
there
is
an
Italian
print
of
one
*NL*
of
the
Muses
.
She
is
draped
in
a
tunic
,
and
she
is
looking
at
the
*NL*
moon
,
with
forget-me-nots
in
her
flowing
hair
.
Something
drove
me
there
*NL*
continually
;
I
stayed
there
hours
together
.
''
Then
in
a
trembling
voice
,
*NL*
``
She
resembled
you
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
turned
away
her
head
that
he
might
not
see
the
*NL*
irrepressible
smile
she
felt
rising
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Often
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
I
wrote
you
letters
that
I
tore
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
He
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
fancied
that
some
chance
would
bring
you
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
recognised
you
at
street-corners
,
and
I
ran
after
all
the
carriages
*NL*
through
whose
windows
I
saw
a
shawl
fluttering
,
a
veil
like
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
resolved
to
let
him
go
on
speaking
without
interruption
.
*NL*
Crossing
her
arms
and
bending
down
her
face
,
she
looked
at
the
rosettes
*NL*
on
her
slippers
,
and
at
intervals
made
little
movements
inside
the
satin
*NL*
of
them
with
her
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
most
wretched
thing
,
is
it
not
--
is
to
drag
out
,
as
I
do
,
a
*NL*
useless
existence
.
If
our
pains
were
only
of
some
use
to
someone
,
we
*NL*
should
find
consolation
in
the
thought
of
the
sacrifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
off
in
praise
of
virtue
,
duty
,
and
silent
immolation
,
having
*NL*
himself
an
incredible
longing
for
self-sacrifice
that
he
could
not
*NL*
satisfy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
much
like
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
be
a
nurse
at
a
hospital
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
men
have
none
of
these
holy
missions
,
and
I
see
nowhere
any
*NL*
calling
--
unless
perhaps
that
of
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
slight
shrug
of
her
shoulders
,
Emma
interrupted
him
to
speak
of
*NL*
her
illness
,
which
had
almost
killed
her
.
What
a
pity
!
She
should
not
be
*NL*
suffering
now
!
Leon
at
once
envied
the
calm
of
the
tomb
,
and
one
evening
*NL*
he
had
even
made
his
will
,
asking
to
be
buried
in
that
beautiful
rug
*NL*
with
velvet
stripes
he
had
received
from
her
.
For
this
was
how
they
*NL*
would
have
wished
to
be
,
each
setting
up
an
ideal
to
which
they
were
now
*NL*
adapting
their
past
life
.
Besides
,
speech
is
a
rolling-mill
that
always
*NL*
thins
out
the
sentiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
invention
of
the
rug
she
asked
,
``
But
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
He
hesitated
.
``
Because
I
loved
you
so
!
''
And
congratulating
*NL*
himself
at
having
surmounted
the
difficulty
,
Leon
watched
her
face
out
*NL*
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
the
sky
when
a
gust
of
wind
drives
the
clouds
across
.
The
*NL*
mass
of
sad
thoughts
that
darkened
them
seemed
to
be
lifted
from
her
*NL*
blue
eyes
;
her
whole
face
shone
.
He
waited
.
At
last
she
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
suspected
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
went
over
all
the
trifling
events
of
that
far-off
existence
,
*NL*
whose
joys
and
sorrows
they
had
just
summed
up
in
one
word
.
They
*NL*
recalled
the
arbour
with
clematis
,
the
dresses
she
had
worn
,
the
*NL*
furniture
of
her
room
,
the
whole
of
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
poor
cactuses
,
where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cold
killed
them
this
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
how
I
have
thought
of
them
,
do
you
know
?
I
often
saw
them
again
as
*NL*
of
yore
,
when
on
the
summer
mornings
the
sun
beat
down
upon
your
blinds
,
*NL*
and
I
saw
your
two
bare
arms
passing
out
amongst
the
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
friend
!
''
she
said
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
swiftly
pressed
his
lips
to
it
.
Then
,
when
he
had
taken
a
deep
*NL*
breath
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
that
time
you
were
to
me
I
know
not
what
incomprehensible
force
that
*NL*
took
captive
my
life
.
Once
,
for
instance
,
I
went
to
see
you
;
but
you
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
do
not
remember
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
she
said
;
``
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
downstairs
in
the
ante-room
,
ready
to
go
out
,
standing
on
*NL*
the
last
stair
;
you
were
wearing
a
bonnet
with
small
blue
flowers
;
and
*NL*
without
any
invitation
from
you
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
I
went
with
you
.
*NL*
Every
moment
,
however
,
I
grew
more
and
more
conscious
of
my
folly
,
and
*NL*
I
went
on
walking
by
you
,
not
daring
to
follow
you
completely
,
and
*NL*
unwilling
to
leave
you
.
When
you
went
into
a
shop
,
I
waited
in
the
*NL*
street
,
and
I
watched
you
through
the
window
taking
off
your
gloves
and
*NL*
counting
the
change
on
the
counter
.
Then
you
rang
at
Madame
Tuvache
's
;
*NL*
you
were
let
in
,
and
I
stood
like
an
idiot
in
front
of
the
great
heavy
*NL*
door
that
had
closed
after
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
,
as
she
listened
to
him
,
wondered
that
she
was
so
old
.
All
*NL*
these
things
reappearing
before
her
seemed
to
widen
out
her
life
;
it
was
*NL*
like
some
sentimental
immensity
to
which
she
returned
;
and
from
time
to
*NL*
time
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
her
eyes
half
closed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
true
--
true
--
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
eight
strike
on
the
different
clocks
of
the
Beauvoisine
*NL*
quarter
,
which
is
full
of
schools
,
churches
,
and
large
empty
hotels
.
*NL*
They
no
longer
spoke
,
but
they
felt
as
they
looked
upon
each
other
a
*NL*
buzzing
in
their
heads
,
as
if
something
sonorous
had
escaped
from
the
*NL*
fixed
eyes
of
each
of
them
.
They
were
hand
in
hand
now
,
and
the
past
,
*NL*
the
future
,
reminiscences
and
dreams
,
all
were
confounded
in
the
*NL*
sweetness
of
this
ecstasy
.
Night
was
darkening
over
the
walls
,
on
which
*NL*
still
shone
,
half
hidden
in
the
shade
,
the
coarse
colours
of
four
bills
*NL*
representing
four
scenes
from
the
``
Tour
de
Nesle
,
''
with
a
motto
in
*NL*
Spanish
and
French
at
the
bottom
.
Through
the
sash-window
a
patch
of
*NL*
dark
sky
was
seen
between
the
pointed
roofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
to
light
two
wax-candles
on
the
drawers
,
then
she
sat
down
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
how
to
resume
the
interrupted
conversation
,
when
she
*NL*
said
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
that
no
one
until
now
has
ever
expressed
such
sentiments
to
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
said
that
ideal
natures
were
difficult
to
understand
.
He
from
*NL*
the
first
moment
had
loved
her
,
and
he
despaired
when
he
thought
of
the
*NL*
happiness
that
would
have
been
theirs
,
if
thanks
to
fortune
,
meeting
her
*NL*
earlier
,
they
had
been
indissolubly
bound
to
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sometimes
thought
of
it
,
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dream
!
''
murmured
Leon
.
And
fingering
gently
the
blue
binding
of
*NL*
her
long
white
sash
,
he
added
,
``
And
who
prevents
us
from
beginning
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
friend
,
''
she
replied
;
``
I
am
too
old
;
you
are
too
young
.
Forget
*NL*
me
!
Others
will
love
you
;
you
will
love
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
you
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
child
you
are
!
Come
,
let
us
be
sensible
.
I
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
showed
him
the
impossibility
of
their
love
,
and
that
they
must
*NL*
remain
,
as
formerly
,
on
the
simple
terms
of
a
fraternal
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
she
speaking
thus
seriously
?
No
doubt
Emma
did
not
herself
know
,
*NL*
quite
absorbed
as
she
was
by
the
charm
of
the
seduction
,
and
the
*NL*
necessity
of
defending
herself
from
it
;
and
contemplating
the
young
*NL*
man
with
a
moved
look
,
she
gently
repulsed
the
timid
caresses
that
his
*NL*
trembling
hands
attempted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
forgive
me
!
''
he
cried
,
drawing
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
seized
with
a
vague
fear
at
this
shyness
,
more
dangerous
to
her
*NL*
than
the
boldness
of
Rodolphe
when
he
advanced
to
her
open-armed
.
No
man
*NL*
had
ever
seemed
to
her
so
beautiful
.
An
exquisite
candour
emanated
from
*NL*
his
being
.
He
lowered
his
long
fine
eyelashes
,
that
curled
upwards
.
*NL*
His
cheek
,
with
the
soft
skin
reddened
,
she
thought
,
with
desire
of
her
*NL*
person
,
and
Emma
felt
an
invincible
longing
to
press
her
lips
to
it
.
*NL*
Then
,
leaning
towards
the
clock
as
if
to
see
the
time
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
how
late
it
is
!
''
she
said
;
``
how
we
do
chatter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
understood
the
hint
and
took
up
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
even
made
me
forget
the
theatre
.
And
poor
Bovary
has
left
me
*NL*
here
especially
for
that
.
Monsieur
Lormeaux
,
of
the
Rue
Grand-Pont
,
was
*NL*
to
take
me
and
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
opportunity
was
lost
,
as
she
was
to
leave
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
see
you
again
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
wanted
to
tell
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
--
important
--
serious
.
Oh
,
no
!
Besides
,
you
will
not
go
;
it
is
*NL*
impossible
.
If
you
should
--
listen
to
me
.
Then
you
have
not
understood
*NL*
me
;
you
have
not
guessed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
speak
plainly
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
can
jest
.
Enough
!
enough
!
Oh
,
for
pity
's
sake
,
let
me
see
you
*NL*
once
--
only
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
She
stopped
;
then
,
as
if
thinking
better
of
it
,
``
Oh
,
not
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
--
''
She
seemed
to
reflect
;
then
abruptly
,
``
To-morrow
at
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
cathedral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
there
,
''
he
cried
,
seizing
her
hands
,
which
she
disengaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
they
were
both
standing
up
,
he
behind
her
,
and
Emma
with
her
head
*NL*
bent
,
he
stooped
over
her
and
pressed
long
kisses
on
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mad
!
Ah
!
you
are
mad
!
''
she
said
,
with
sounding
little
laughs
,
*NL*
while
the
kisses
multiplied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
bending
his
head
over
her
shoulder
,
he
seemed
to
beg
the
consent
of
*NL*
her
eyes
.
They
fell
upon
him
full
of
an
icy
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
stepped
back
to
go
out
.
He
stopped
on
the
threshold
;
then
he
*NL*
whispered
with
a
trembling
voice
,
``
Tomorrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
with
a
nod
,
and
disappeared
like
a
bird
into
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Emma
wrote
the
clerk
an
interminable
letter
,
in
which
she
*NL*
cancelled
the
rendezvous
;
all
was
over
;
they
must
not
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
their
happiness
,
meet
again
.
But
when
the
letter
was
finished
,
as
she
*NL*
did
not
know
Leon
's
address
,
she
was
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
it
to
him
myself
,
''
she
said
;
``
he
will
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
at
the
open
window
,
and
humming
on
his
balcony
,
Leon
*NL*
himself
varnished
his
pumps
with
several
coatings
.
He
put
on
white
*NL*
trousers
,
fine
socks
,
a
green
coat
,
emptied
all
the
scent
he
had
into
*NL*
his
handkerchief
,
then
having
had
his
hair
curled
,
he
uncurled
it
again
,
*NL*
in
order
to
give
it
a
more
natural
elegance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
still
too
early
,
''
he
thought
,
looking
at
the
hairdresser
's
*NL*
cuckoo-clock
,
that
pointed
to
the
hour
of
nine
.
He
read
an
old
fashion
*NL*
journal
,
went
out
,
smoked
a
cigar
,
walked
up
three
streets
,
thought
it
*NL*
was
time
,
and
went
slowly
towards
the
porch
of
Notre
Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
beautiful
summer
morning
.
Silver
plate
sparkled
in
the
*NL*
jeweller
's
windows
,
and
the
light
falling
obliquely
on
the
cathedral
*NL*
made
mirrors
of
the
corners
of
the
grey
stones
;
a
flock
of
birds
*NL*
fluttered
in
the
grey
sky
round
the
trefoil
bell-turrets
;
the
square
,
*NL*
resounding
with
cries
,
was
fragrant
with
the
flowers
that
bordered
its
*NL*
pavement
,
roses
,
jasmines
,
pinks
,
narcissi
,
and
tube-roses
,
unevenly
*NL*
spaced
out
between
moist
grasses
,
catmint
,
and
chickweed
for
the
birds
;
*NL*
the
fountains
gurgled
in
the
centre
,
and
under
large
umbrellas
,
amidst
*NL*
melons
,
piled
up
in
heaps
,
flower-women
,
bare-headed
,
were
twisting
*NL*
paper
round
bunches
of
violets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
took
one
.
It
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
bought
flowers
*NL*
for
a
woman
,
and
his
breast
,
as
he
smelt
them
,
swelled
with
pride
,
as
if
*NL*
this
homage
that
he
meant
for
another
had
recoiled
upon
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
afraid
of
being
seen
;
he
resolutely
entered
the
church
.
The
*NL*
beadle
,
who
was
just
then
standing
on
the
threshold
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
left
doorway
,
under
the
``
Dancing
Marianne
,
''
with
feather
cap
,
and
rapier
*NL*
dangling
against
his
calves
,
came
in
,
more
majestic
than
a
cardinal
,
and
*NL*
as
shining
as
a
saint
on
a
holy
pyx
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
towards
Leon
,
and
,
with
that
smile
of
wheedling
benignity
*NL*
assumed
by
ecclesiastics
when
they
question
children
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
,
no
doubt
,
does
not
belong
to
these
parts
?
The
gentleman
*NL*
would
like
to
see
the
curiosities
of
the
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
first
went
round
the
lower
aisles
.
Then
he
went
out
to
look
at
*NL*
the
Place
.
Emma
was
not
coming
yet
.
He
went
up
again
to
the
choir
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nave
was
reflected
in
the
full
fonts
with
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
arches
and
some
portions
of
the
glass
windows
.
But
the
reflections
of
*NL*
the
paintings
,
broken
by
the
marble
rim
,
were
continued
farther
on
upon
*NL*
the
flag-stones
,
like
a
many-coloured
carpet
.
The
broad
daylight
from
*NL*
without
streamed
into
the
church
in
three
enormous
rays
from
the
three
*NL*
opened
portals
.
From
time
to
time
at
the
upper
end
a
sacristan
passed
,
*NL*
making
the
oblique
genuflexion
of
devout
persons
in
a
hurry
.
The
crystal
*NL*
lustres
hung
motionless
.
In
the
choir
a
silver
lamp
was
burning
,
and
*NL*
from
the
side
chapels
and
dark
places
of
the
church
sometimes
rose
*NL*
sounds
like
sighs
,
with
the
clang
of
a
closing
grating
,
its
echo
*NL*
reverberating
under
the
lofty
vault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
with
solemn
steps
walked
along
by
the
walls
.
Life
had
never
seemed
*NL*
so
good
to
him
.
She
would
come
directly
,
charming
,
agitated
,
looking
*NL*
back
at
the
glances
that
followed
her
,
and
with
her
flounced
dress
,
her
*NL*
gold
eyeglass
,
her
thin
shoes
,
with
all
sorts
of
elegant
trifles
that
he
*NL*
had
never
enjoyed
,
and
with
the
ineffable
seduction
of
yielding
virtue
.
*NL*
The
church
like
a
huge
boudoir
spread
around
her
;
the
arches
bent
down
*NL*
to
gather
in
the
shade
the
confession
of
her
love
;
the
windows
shone
*NL*
resplendent
to
illumine
her
face
,
and
the
censers
would
burn
that
she
*NL*
might
appear
like
an
angel
amid
the
fumes
of
the
sweet-smelling
odours
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
come
.
He
sat
down
on
a
chair
,
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
*NL*
blue
stained
window
representing
boatmen
carrying
baskets
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
it
long
,
attentively
,
and
he
counted
the
scales
of
the
fishes
and
the
*NL*
button-holes
of
the
doublets
,
while
his
thoughts
wandered
off
towards
*NL*
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beadle
,
standing
aloof
,
was
inwardly
angry
at
this
individual
who
*NL*
took
the
liberty
of
admiring
the
cathedral
by
himself
.
He
seemed
to
him
*NL*
to
be
conducting
himself
in
a
monstrous
fashion
,
to
be
robbing
him
in
a
*NL*
sort
,
and
almost
committing
sacrilege
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
rustle
of
silk
on
the
flags
,
the
tip
of
a
bonnet
,
a
lined
*NL*
cloak
--
it
was
she
!
Leon
rose
and
ran
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
pale
.
She
walked
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
!
''
she
said
,
holding
out
a
paper
to
him
.
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
abruptly
withdrew
her
hand
to
enter
the
chapel
of
the
Virgin
,
*NL*
where
,
kneeling
on
a
chair
,
she
began
to
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
irritated
at
this
bigot
fancy
;
then
he
nevertheless
*NL*
experienced
a
certain
charm
in
seeing
her
,
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
rendezvous
,
thus
lost
in
her
devotions
,
like
an
Andalusian
marchioness
;
*NL*
then
he
grew
bored
,
for
she
seemed
never
coming
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
prayed
,
or
rather
strove
to
pray
,
hoping
that
some
sudden
*NL*
resolution
might
descend
to
her
from
heaven
;
and
to
draw
down
divine
*NL*
aid
she
filled
full
her
eyes
with
the
splendours
of
the
tabernacle
.
She
*NL*
breathed
in
the
perfumes
of
the
full-blown
flowers
in
the
large
vases
,
*NL*
and
listened
to
the
stillness
of
the
church
,
that
only
heightened
the
*NL*
tumult
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
,
and
they
were
about
to
leave
,
when
the
beadle
came
forward
,
*NL*
hurriedly
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
no
doubt
,
does
not
belong
to
these
parts
?
Madame
would
like
to
*NL*
see
the
curiosities
of
the
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
cried
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
she
.
For
she
clung
with
her
expiring
virtue
to
the
*NL*
Virgin
,
the
sculptures
,
the
tombs
--
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
in
order
to
proceed
``
by
rule
,
''
the
beadle
conducted
them
right
to
*NL*
the
entrance
near
the
square
,
where
,
pointing
out
with
his
cane
a
large
*NL*
circle
of
block-stones
without
inscription
or
carving
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
he
said
majestically
,
``
is
the
circumference
of
the
beautiful
*NL*
bell
of
Ambroise
.
It
weighed
forty
thousand
pounds
.
There
was
not
its
*NL*
equal
in
all
Europe
.
The
workman
who
cast
it
died
of
the
joy
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
on
,
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
fellow
started
off
again
;
then
,
having
got
back
to
the
chapel
of
*NL*
the
Virgin
,
he
stretched
forth
his
arm
with
an
all-embracing
gesture
*NL*
of
demonstration
,
and
,
prouder
than
a
country
squire
showing
you
his
*NL*
espaliers
,
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
simple
stone
covers
Pierre
de
Breze

lord
of
Varenne
and
of
*NL*
Brissac

Poitou
,
and
governor
of
Normandy
,
who
died
at
*NL*
the
battle
of
Montlhery
on
the
16th
of
July
,
1465
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
bit
his
lips
,
fuming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
the
right
,
this
gentleman
all
encased
in
iron

on

grandson

the

*NL*
It
is
not
possible
,
is
it
,
to
see
a
more
perfect
representation
of
*NL*
annihilation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
put
up
her
eyeglasses
.
Leon
,
motionless
,
looked
at
her
,
*NL*
no
longer
even
attempting
to
speak
a
single
word
,
to
make
a
gesture
,
*NL*
so
discouraged
was
he
at
this
two-fold
obstinacy
of
gossip
and
*NL*
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
everlasting
guide
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
him
,
this
kneeling
woman
who
weeps
is
his
spouse
,
Diane
de
*NL*
Poitiers
,
Countess
de
Breze
,
Duchess
de
Valentinois
,
born
in
1499
,
died
*NL*
in
1566
,
and
to
the
left
,
the
one
with
the
child
is
the
Holy
Virgin
.
Now
*NL*
turn
to
this
side
;
here
are
the
tombs
of
the
Ambroise
.
They
were
both
*NL*
cardinals
and
archbishops
of
Rouen
.
That
one
was
minister
under
Louis
*NL*
XII
.
He
did
a
great
deal
for
the
cathedral
.
In
his
will
he
left
thirty
*NL*
thousand
gold
crowns
for
the
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
stopping
,
still
talking
,
he
pushed
them
into
a
chapel
*NL*
full
of
balustrades
,
some
put
away
,
and
disclosed
a
kind
of
block
that
*NL*
certainly
might
once
have
been
an
ill-made
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
''
he
said
with
a
groan
,
``
it
adorned
the
tomb
of
Richard
Coeur
de
*NL*
Lion
,
King
of
England
and
Duke
of
Normandy
.
It
was
the
Calvinists
,
sir
,
*NL*
who
reduced
it
to
this
condition
.
They
had
buried
it
for
spite
in
the
*NL*
earth
,
under
the
episcopal
seat
of
Monsignor
.
See
!
this
is
the
door
by
*NL*
which
Monsignor
passes
to
his
house
.
Let
us
pass
on
quickly
to
see
the
*NL*
gargoyle
windows

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Leon
hastily
took
some
silver
from
his
pocket
and
seized
Emma
's
*NL*
arm
.
The
beadle
stood
dumfounded
,
not
able
to
understand
this
untimely
*NL*
munificence
when
there
were
still
so
many
things
for
the
stranger
to
*NL*
see
.
So
calling
him
back
,
he
cried
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
sir
!
The
steeple
!
the
steeple
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
!
''
said
Leon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
,
sir
!
It
is
four
hundred
and
forty
feet
high

nine
less
*NL*
than

pyramid

*NL*
Leon
was
fleeing
,
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
love
,
that
for
nearly
*NL*
two
hours
now
had
become
petrified
in
the
church
like
the
stones
,
would
*NL*
vanish
like
a
vapour
through
that
sort
of
truncated
funnel
,
of
oblong
*NL*
cage
,
of
open
chimney
that
rises
so
grotesquely
from
the
cathedral
like
*NL*
the
extravagant
attempt
of
some
fantastic
brazier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
we
going
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Making
no
answer
,
he
walked
on
with
a
rapid
step
;
and
Madame
Bovary
*NL*
was
already
,
dipping
her
finger
in
the
holy
water
when
behind
them
they
*NL*
heard
a
panting
breath
interrupted
by
the
regular
sound
of
a
cane
.
Leon
*NL*
turned
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
recognised
the
beadle
,
holding
under
his
arms
and
balancing
*NL*
against
his
stomach
some
twenty
large
sewn
volumes
.
They
were
works
*NL*
``
which
treated
of
the
cathedral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Idiot
!
''
growled
Leon
,
rushing
out
of
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lad
was
playing
about
the
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
get
me
a
cab
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
bounded
off
like
a
ball
by
the
Rue
Quatre-Vents
;
then
they
*NL*
were
alone
a
few
minutes
,
face
to
face
,
and
a
little
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Leon
!
Really
--
I
do
n't
know
--
if
I
ought
,
''
she
whispered
.
Then
with
a
*NL*
more
serious
air
,
``
Do
you
know
,
it
is
very
improper
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
replied
the
clerk
.
``
It
is
done
at
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
,
as
an
irresistible
argument
,
decided
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
cab
did
not
come
.
Leon
was
afraid
she
might
go
back
into
the
*NL*
church
.
At
last
the
cab
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
go
out
by
the
north
porch
,
''
cried
the
beadle
,
who
was
*NL*
left
alone
on
the
threshold
,
``
so
as
to
see
the
Resurrection
,
the
Last
*NL*
Judgment
,
Paradise
,
King
David
,
and
the
Condemned
in
Hell-flames
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
,
sir
?
''
asked
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
like
,
''
said
Leon
,
forcing
Emma
into
the
cab
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
lumbering
machine
set
out
.
It
went
down
the
Rue
Grand-Pont
,
*NL*
crossed
the
Place
des
Arts
,
the
Quai
Napoleon
,
the
Pont
Neuf
,
and
*NL*
stopped
short
before
the
statue
of
Pierre
Corneille
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
cried
a
voice
that
came
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cab
went
on
again
,
and
as
soon
as
it
reached
the
Carrefour
*NL*
Lafayette
,
set
off
down-hill
,
and
entered
the
station
at
a
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
straight
on
!
''
cried
the
same
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cab
came
out
by
the
gate
,
and
soon
having
reached
the
Cours
,
trotted
*NL*
quietly
beneath
the
elm-trees
.
The
coachman
wiped
his
brow
,
put
his
*NL*
leather
hat
between
his
knees
,
and
drove
his
carriage
beyond
the
side
*NL*
alley
by
the
meadow
to
the
margin
of
the
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
went
along
by
the
river
,
along
the
towing-path
paved
with
sharp
*NL*
pebbles
,
and
for
a
long
while
in
the
direction
of
Oyssel
,
beyond
the
*NL*
isles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
it
turned
with
a
dash
across
Quatremares
,
Sotteville
,
La
*NL*
Grande-Chaussee
,
the
Rue
d'Elbeuf
,
and
made
its
third
halt
in
front
of
*NL*
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
on
,
will
you
?
''
cried
the
voice
more
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
once
resuming
its
course
,
it
passed
by
Saint-Sever
,
by
the
*NL*
Quai
`
des
Curandiers
,
the
Quai
aux
Meules
,
once
more
over
the
bridge
,
by
*NL*
the
Place
du
Champ
de
Mars
,
and
behind
the
hospital
gardens
,
where
old
*NL*
men
in
black
coats
were
walking
in
the
sun
along
the
terrace
all
green
*NL*
with
ivy
.
It
went
up
the
Boulevard
Bouvreuil
,
along
the
Boulevard
*NL*
Cauchoise
,
then
the
whole
of
Mont-Riboudet
to
the
Deville
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
back
;
and
then
,
without
any
fixed
plan
or
direction
,
wandered
*NL*
about
at
hazard
.
The
cab
was
seen
at
Saint-Pol
,
at
Lescure
,
at
Mont
*NL*
Gargan
,
at
La
Rougue-Marc
and
Place
du
Gaillardbois
;
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Maladrerie
,
Rue
Dinanderie
,
before
Saint-Romain
,
Saint-Vivien
,
*NL*
Saint-Maclou
,
Saint-Nicaise
--
in
front
of
the
Customs
,
at
the
``
Vieille
*NL*
Tour
,
''
the
``
Trois
Pipes
,
''
and
the
Monumental
Cemetery
.
From
time
to
time
*NL*
the
coachman
,
on
his
box
cast
despairing
eyes
at
the
public-houses
.
*NL*
He
could
not
understand
what
furious
desire
for
locomotion
urged
these
*NL*
individuals
never
to
wish
to
stop
.
He
tried
to
now
and
then
,
and
at
*NL*
once
exclamations
of
anger
burst
forth
behind
him
.
Then
he
lashed
his
*NL*
perspiring
jades
afresh
,
but
indifferent
to
their
jolting
,
running
up
*NL*
against
things
here
and
there
,
not
caring
if
he
did
,
demoralised
,
and
*NL*
almost
weeping
with
thirst
,
fatigue
,
and
depression
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
the
harbour
,
in
the
midst
of
the
drays
and
casks
,
and
in
the
*NL*
streets
,
at
the
corners
,
the
good
folk
opened
large
wonder-stricken
*NL*
eyes
at
this
sight
,
so
extraordinary
in
the
provinces
,
a
cab
with
blinds
*NL*
drawn
,
and
which
appeared
thus
constantly
shut
more
closely
than
a
tomb
,
*NL*
and
tossing
about
like
a
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
in
the
open
country
,
just
as
the
sun
*NL*
beat
most
fiercely
against
the
old
plated
lanterns
,
a
bared
hand
passed
*NL*
beneath
the
small
blinds
of
yellow
canvas
,
and
threw
out
some
scraps
*NL*
of
paper
that
scattered
in
the
wind
,
and
farther
off
lighted
like
white
*NL*
butterflies
on
a
field
of
red
clover
all
in
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
six
o'clock
the
carriage
stopped
in
a
back
street
of
the
*NL*
Beauvoisine
Quarter
,
and
a
woman
got
out
,
who
walked
with
her
veil
down
,
*NL*
and
without
turning
her
head
.

Chapter
Two
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
inn
,
Madame
Bovary
was
surprised
not
to
see
the
*NL*
diligence
.
Hivert
,
who
had
waited
for
her
fifty-three
minutes
,
had
at
*NL*
last
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
nothing
forced
her
to
go
;
but
she
had
given
her
word
that
she
would
*NL*
return
that
same
evening
.
Moreover
,
Charles
expected
her
,
and
in
her
*NL*
heart
she
felt
already
that
cowardly
docility
that
is
for
some
women
at
*NL*
once
the
chastisement
and
atonement
of
adultery
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
packed
her
box
quickly
,
paid
her
bill
,
took
a
cab
in
the
yard
,
*NL*
hurrying
on
the
driver
,
urging
him
on
,
every
moment
inquiring
about
*NL*
the
time
and
the
miles
traversed
.
He
succeeded
in
catching
up
the
*NL*
``
Hirondelle
''
as
it
neared
the
first
houses
of
Quincampoix
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
was
she
seated
in
her
corner
than
she
closed
her
eyes
,
and
opened
*NL*
them
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
when
from
afar
she
recognised
Felicite
,
*NL*
who
was
on
the
lookout
in
front
of
the
farrier
's
shop
.
Hivert
pulled
*NL*
in
his
horses
and
,
the
servant
,
climbing
up
to
the
window
,
said
*NL*
mysteriously
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
you
must
go
at
once
to
Monsieur
Homais
.
It
's
for
something
*NL*
important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
village
was
silent
as
usual
.
At
the
corner
of
the
streets
were
small
*NL*
pink
heaps
that
smoked
in
the
air
,
for
this
was
the
time
for
jam-making
,
*NL*
and
everyone
at
Yonville
prepared
his
supply
on
the
same
day
.
But
in
*NL*
front
of
the
chemist
's
shop
one
might
admire
a
far
larger
heap
,
and
that
*NL*
surpassed
the
others
with
the
superiority
that
a
laboratory
must
have
*NL*
over
ordinary
stores
,
a
general
need
over
individual
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
in
.
The
large
arm-chair
was
upset
,
and
even
the
``
Fanal
de
*NL*
Rouen
''
lay
on
the
ground
,
outspread
between
two
pestles
.
She
pushed
open
*NL*
the
lobby
door
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
,
amid
brown
jars
full
*NL*
of
picked
currants
,
of
powdered
sugar
and
lump
sugar
,
of
the
scales
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
of
the
pans
on
the
fire
,
she
saw
all
the
Homais
,
small
*NL*
and
large
,
with
aprons
reaching
to
their
chins
,
and
with
forks
in
their
*NL*
hands
.
Justin
was
standing
up
with
bowed
head
,
and
the
chemist
was
*NL*
screaming
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
to
go
and
fetch
it
in
the
Capharnaum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
replied
the
druggist
.
``
We
are
making
preserves
;
they
are
*NL*
simmering
;
but
they
were
about
to
boil
over
,
because
there
is
too
*NL*
much
juice
,
and
I
ordered
another
pan
.
Then
he
,
from
indolence
,
from
*NL*
laziness
,
went
and
took
,
hanging
on
its
nail
in
my
laboratory
,
the
key
*NL*
of
the
Capharnaum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
the
druggist
called
a
small
room
under
the
leads
,
full
of
*NL*
the
utensils
and
the
goods
of
his
trade
.
He
often
spent
long
hours
there
*NL*
alone
,
labelling
,
decanting
,
and
doing
up
again
;
and
he
looked
upon
*NL*
it
not
as
a
simple
store
,
but
as
a
veritable
sanctuary
,
whence
there
*NL*
afterwards
issued
,
elaborated
by
his
hands
,
all
sorts
of
pills
,
boluses
,
*NL*
infusions
,
lotions
,
and
potions
,
that
would
bear
far
and
wide
his
*NL*
celebrity
.
No
one
in
the
world
set
foot
there
,
and
he
respected
it
so
,
*NL*
that
he
swept
it
himself
.
Finally
,
if
the
pharmacy
,
open
to
all
comers
,
*NL*
was
the
spot
where
he
displayed
his
pride
,
the
Capharnaum
was
the
refuge
*NL*
where
,
egoistically
concentrating
himself
,
Homais
delighted
in
the
*NL*
exercise
of
his
predilections
,
so
that
Justin
's
thoughtlessness
seemed
*NL*
to
him
a
monstrous
piece
of
irreverence
,
and
,
redder
than
the
currants
,
*NL*
he
repeated
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
from
the
Capharnaum
!
The
key
that
locks
up
the
acids
and
caustic
*NL*
alkalies
!
To
go
and
get
a
spare
pan
!
a
pan
with
a
lid
!
and
that
I
*NL*
shall
perhaps
never
use
!
Everything
is
of
importance
in
the
delicate
*NL*
operations
of
our
art
!
But
,
devil
take
it
!
one
must
make
distinctions
,
*NL*
and
not
employ
for
almost
domestic
purposes
that
which
is
meant
for
*NL*
pharmaceutical
!
It
is
as
if
one
were
to
carve
a
fowl
with
a
scalpel
;
as
*NL*
if
a
magistrate
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
be
calm
,
''
said
Madame
Homais
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Athalie
,
pulling
at
his
coat
,
cried
``
Papa
!
papa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
let
me
alone

went
on
the
druggist
``
let
me
alone

hang
it

One

up

*NL*
``

said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently

Do
you

exposed

Did
n't
you

anything

*NL*
*NL*
``

stammered
the
young
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Well

You
saw
a

glass

sealed
with
yellow
wax

that
contains
a
white
powder

on
which
I

have
even
written

And
do
you
know
what
is
in

Arsenic

*NL*
And
you
go

*NL*
*NL*
``
Next

cried
Madame
Homais
,
clasping
her
hands
.
``
Arsenic
!
You
*NL*
might
have
poisoned
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
children
began
howling
as
if
they
already
had
frightful
pains
in
*NL*
their
entrails
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
poison
a
patient
!
''
continued
the
druggist
.
``
Do
you
want
to
see
me

in
the

To

care
I
take
in
managing

although
I
am
so
thoroughly

Often
I
am
horrified

myself

I
think
of
my
responsibility

''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
no
longer
dreamed
of
asking
what
they
wanted
her
for
,
and
the
*NL*
druggist
went
on
in
breathless
phrases
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

What

Who

*NL*
with
honour
in
the
ranks
of
society

But
you
must
pull
hard
at
the
oar
*NL*
if
you
're
to
do
that
,
and
get
,
as

people
say
,
callosities
upon
your
*NL*
hands

*NL*
*NL*

The
worker
lives
by
working
,
do
what
he
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
exasperated
he
quoted
Latin
.
He
would
have
quoted
Chinese
*NL*
or
Greenlandish
had
he
known
those
two
languages
,
for
he
was
in
one
*NL*
of
those
crises
in
which
the
whole
soul
shows
indistinctly
what
it
*NL*
contains
,
like
the
ocean
,
which
,
in
the
storm
,
opens
itself
from
the
*NL*
seaweeds
on
its
shores
down
to
the
sands
of
its
abysses
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
beginning
to
repent
terribly
of
having
taken
you
up
!
I
should
*NL*
certainly
have
done
better
to
have
left
you
to
rot
in
your
poverty
and
*NL*
the
dirt
in
which
you
were
born
.
Oh
,
you
'll
never
be
fit
for
anything
*NL*
but
to
herd
animals
with
horns
!
You
have
no
aptitude
for
science
!
You
*NL*
hardly
know
how
to
stick
on
a
label
!
And
there
you
are
,
dwelling
with
me
*NL*
snug
as
a
parson
,
living
in
clover
,
taking
your
ease
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Emma
,
turning
to
Madame
Homais
,
``
I
was
told
to
come
here
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
!
''
interrupted
the
good
woman
,
with
a
sad
air
,
``
how
am
I
to
*NL*
tell
you
?
It
is
a
misfortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
finish
,
the
druggist
was
thundering
--
``
Empty
it
!
Clean
it
!
*NL*
Take
it
back
!
Be
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
seizing
Justin
by
the
collar
of
his
blouse
,
he
shook
a
book
out
of
*NL*
his
pocket
.
The
lad
stooped
,
but
Homais
was
the
quicker
,
and
,
having
*NL*
picked
up
the
volume
,
contemplated
it
with
staring
eyes
and
open
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
CONJUGAL
--
LOVE
!
''
he
said
,
slowly
separating
the
two
words
.
``
Ah
!
very
*NL*
good
!
very
good
!
very
pretty
!
And
illustrations
!
Oh
,
this
is
too
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Homais
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
not
touch
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
wanted
to
look
at
the
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
room
,
''
he
said
imperiously
;
and
they
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
he
walked
up
and
down
with
the
open
volume
in
his
hand
,
rolling
*NL*
his
eyes
,
choking
,
tumid
,
apoplectic
.
Then
he
came
straight
to
his
*NL*
pupil
,
and
,
planting
himself
in
front
of
him
with
crossed
arms
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
every
vice
,
then
,
little
wretch
?
Take
care
!
you
are
on
a
*NL*
downward
path
.
Did
not
you
reflect
that
this
infamous
book
might
fall
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
my
children
,
kindle
a
spark
in
their
minds
,
tarnish
the
*NL*
purity
of
Athalie
,
corrupt
Napoleon
.
He
is
already
formed
like
a
man
.
*NL*
Are
you
quite
sure
,
anyhow
,
that
they
have
not
read
it
?
Can
you
certify
*NL*
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
really
,
sir
,
''
said
Emma
,
``
you
wished
to
tell
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
madame
.
Your
father-in-law
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Monsieur
Bovary
senior
had
expired
the
evening
before
suddenly
*NL*
from
an
attack
of
apoplexy
as
he
got
up
from
table
,
and
by
way
of
*NL*
greater
precaution
,
on
account
of
Emma
's
sensibility
,
Charles
had
begged
*NL*
Homais
to
break
the
horrible
news
to
her
gradually
.
Homais
had
thought
*NL*
over
his
speech
;
he
had
rounded
,
polished
it
,
made
it
rhythmical
;
it
was
*NL*
a
masterpiece
of
prudence
and
transitions
,
of
subtle
turns
and
delicacy
;
*NL*
but
anger
had
got
the
better
of
rhetoric
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
giving
up
all
chance
of
hearing
any
details
,
left
the
pharmacy
;
*NL*
for
Monsieur
Homais
had
taken
up
the
thread
of
his
vituperations
.
*NL*
However
,
he
was
growing
calmer
,
and
was
now
grumbling
in
a
paternal
tone
*NL*
whilst
he
fanned
himself
with
his
skull-cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
that
I
entirely
disapprove
of
the
work
.
Its
author
was
a
*NL*
doctor
!
There
are
certain
scientific
points
in
it
that
it
is
not
ill
a
*NL*
man
should
know
,
and
I
would
even
venture
to
say
that
a
man
must
know
.
*NL*
But
later
--
later
!
At
any
rate
,
not
till
you
are
man
yourself
and
your
*NL*
temperament
is
formed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Emma
knocked
at
the
door
.
Charles
,
who
was
waiting
for
her
,
came
*NL*
forward
with
open
arms
and
said
to
her
with
tears
in
his
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
bent
over
her
gently
to
kiss
her
.
But
at
the
contact
of
his
lips
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
other
seized
her
,
and
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
*NL*
face
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
made
answer
,
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
I
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
her
the
letter
in
which
his
mother
told
the
event
without
any
*NL*
sentimental
hypocrisy
.
She
only
regretted
her
husband
had
not
received
*NL*
the
consolations
of
religion
,
as
he
had
died
at
Daudeville
,
in
the
*NL*
street
,
at
the
door
of
a
cafe
after
a
patriotic
dinner
with
some
*NL*
ex-officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
gave
him
back
the
letter
;
then
at
dinner
,
for
appearance
's
sake
,
*NL*
she
affected
a
certain
repugnance
.
But
as
he
urged
her
to
try
,
she
*NL*
resolutely
began
eating
,
while
Charles
opposite
her
sat
motionless
in
a
*NL*
dejected
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
then
he
raised
his
head
and
gave
her
a
long
look
full
of
*NL*
distress
.
Once
he
sighed
,
``
I
should
have
liked
to
see
him
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
At
last
,
understanding
that
she
must
say
something
,
``
How
*NL*
old
was
your
father
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty-eight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
added
,
``
My
poor
mother
!
what
will
become
*NL*
of
her
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
gesture
that
signified
she
did
not
know
.
Seeing
her
so
*NL*
taciturn
,
Charles
imagined
her
much
affected
,
and
forced
himself
to
say
*NL*
nothing
,
not
to
reawaken
this
sorrow
which
moved
him
.
And
,
shaking
off
*NL*
his
own
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
enjoy
yourself
yesterday
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cloth
was
removed
,
Bovary
did
not
rise
,
nor
did
Emma
;
and
as
*NL*
she
looked
at
him
,
the
monotony
of
the
spectacle
drove
little
by
little
*NL*
all
pity
from
her
heart
.
He
seemed
to
her
paltry
,
weak
,
a
cipher
--
in
*NL*
a
word
,
a
poor
thing
in
every
way
.
How
to
get
rid
of
him
?
What
an
*NL*
interminable
evening
!
Something
stupefying
like
the
fumes
of
opium
*NL*
seized
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
in
the
passage
the
sharp
noise
of
a
wooden
leg
on
the
boards
.
*NL*
It
was
Hippolyte
bringing
back
Emma
's
luggage
.
In
order
to
put
it
down
*NL*
he
described
painfully
a
quarter
of
a
circle
with
his
stump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
even
remember
any
more
about
it
,
''
she
thought
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
poor
devil
,
whose
coarse
red
hair
was
wet
with
perspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bovary
was
searching
at
the
bottom
of
his
purse
for
a
centime
,
and
*NL*
without
appearing
to
understand
all
there
was
of
humiliation
for
him
*NL*
in
the
mere
presence
of
this
man
,
who
stood
there
like
a
personified
*NL*
reproach
to
his
incurable
incapacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
you
've
a
pretty
bouquet
,
''
he
said
,
noticing
Leon
's
violets
on
*NL*
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
indifferently
;
``
it
's
a
bouquet
I
bought
just
now
from
*NL*
a
beggar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
picked
up
the
flowers
,
and
freshening
his
eyes
,
red
with
tears
,
*NL*
against
them
,
smelt
them
delicately
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
them
quickly
from
his
hand
and
put
them
in
a
glass
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Madame
Bovary
senior
arrived
.
She
and
her
son
wept
much
.
*NL*
Emma
,
on
the
pretext
of
giving
orders
,
disappeared
.
The
following
day
*NL*
they
had
a
talk
over
the
mourning
.
They
went
and
sat
down
with
their
*NL*
workboxes
by
the
waterside
under
the
arbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
thinking
of
his
father
,
and
was
surprised
to
feel
so
much
*NL*
affection
for
this
man
,
whom
till
then
he
had
thought
he
cared
little
*NL*
about
.
Madame
Bovary
senior
was
thinking
of
her
husband
.
The
worst
*NL*
days
of
the
past
seemed
enviable
to
her
.
All
was
forgotten
beneath
the
*NL*
instinctive
regret
of
such
a
long
habit
,
and
from
time
to
time
whilst
*NL*
she
sewed
,
a
big
tear
rolled
along
her
nose
and
hung
suspended
there
a
*NL*
moment
.
Emma
was
thinking
that
it
was
scarcely
forty-eight
hours
since
*NL*
they
had
been
together
,
far
from
the
world
,
all
in
a
frenzy
of
joy
,
and
*NL*
not
having
eyes
enough
to
gaze
upon
each
other
.
She
tried
to
recall
the
*NL*
slightest
details
of
that
past
day
.
But
the
presence
of
her
husband
and
*NL*
mother-in-law
worried
her
.
She
would
have
liked
to
hear
nothing
,
to
see
*NL*
nothing
,
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
meditation
on
her
love
,
that
,
do
what
*NL*
she
would
,
became
lost
in
external
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
unpicking
the
lining
of
a
dress
,
and
the
strips
were
scattered
*NL*
around
her
.
Madame
Bovary
senior
was
plying
her
scissor
without
looking
*NL*
up
,
and
Charles
,
in
his
list
slippers
and
his
old
brown
surtout
that
he
*NL*
used
as
a
dressing-gown
,
sat
with
both
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
did
not
*NL*
speak
either
;
near
them
Berthe
,
in
a
little
white
pinafore
,
was
raking
*NL*
sand
in
the
walks
with
her
spade
.
Suddenly
she
saw
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
*NL*
the
linendraper
,
come
in
through
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
offer
his
services
``
under
the
sad
circumstances
.
''
Emma
*NL*
answered
that
she
thought
she
could
do
without
.
The
shopkeeper
was
not
*NL*
to
be
beaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
should
like
to
have
a
private
talk
*NL*
with
you
.
''
Then
in
a
low
voice
,
``
It
's
about
that
affair
--
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
crimsoned
to
his
ears
.
``
Oh
,
yes
!
certainly
.
''
And
in
his
*NL*
confusion
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
``
Could
n't
you
,
my
darling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
understand
him
,
for
she
rose
;
and
Charles
said
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
``
It
is
nothing
particular
.
No
doubt
,
some
household
trifle
.
''
He
*NL*
did
not
want
her
to
know
the
story
of
the
bill
,
fearing
her
reproaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
in
sufficiently
clear
*NL*
terms
began
to
congratulate
Emma
on
the
inheritance
,
then
to
talk
of
*NL*
indifferent
matters
,
of
the
espaliers
,
of
the
harvest
,
and
of
his
own
*NL*
health
,
which
was
always
so-so
,
always
having
ups
and
downs
.
In
fact
,
he
*NL*
had
to
work
devilish
hard
,
although
he
did
n't
make
enough
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
people
said
,
to
find
butter
for
his
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
let
him
talk
on
.
She
had
bored
herself
so
prodigiously
the
last
two
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
're
quite
well
again
?
''
he
went
on
.
``
Ma
foi
!
I
saw
your
*NL*
husband
in
a
sad
state
.
He
's
a
good
fellow
,
though
we
did
have
a
little
*NL*
misunderstanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
what
misunderstanding
,
for
Charles
had
said
nothing
of
the
*NL*
dispute
about
the
goods
supplied
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
well
enough
,
''
cried
Lheureux
.
``
It
was
about
your
little
*NL*
fancies
--
the
travelling
trunks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
drawn
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
,
with
his
hands
behind
his
*NL*
back
,
smiling
and
whistling
,
he
looked
straight
at
her
in
an
unbearable
*NL*
manner
.
Did
he
suspect
anything
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
lost
in
all
kinds
of
apprehensions
.
At
last
,
however
,
he
went
*NL*
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
made
it
up
,
all
the
same
,
and
I
've
come
again
to
propose
another
*NL*
arrangement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
to
renew
the
bill
Bovary
had
signed
.
The
doctor
,
of
course
,
*NL*
would
do
as
he
pleased
;
he
was
not
to
trouble
himself
,
especially
just
*NL*
now
,
when
he
would
have
a
lot
of
worry
.
``
And
he
would
do
better
to
give
*NL*
it
over
to
someone
else
--
to
you
,
for
example
.
With
a
power
of
attorney
*NL*
it
could
be
easily
managed
,
and
then
we
-LRB-
you
and
I
-RRB-
would
have
our
*NL*
little
business
transactions
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
understand
.
He
was
silent
.
Then
,
passing
to
his
trade
,
*NL*
Lheureux
declared
that
madame
must
require
something
.
He
would
send
her
*NL*
a
black
barege
,
twelve
yards
,
just
enough
to
make
a
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
you
've
on
is
good
enough
for
the
house
,
but
you
want
another
*NL*
for
calls
.
I
saw
that
the
very
moment
that
I
came
in
.
I
've
the
eye
of
an
*NL*
American
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
send
the
stuff
;
he
brought
it
.
Then
he
came
again
to
measure
*NL*
it
;
he
came
again
on
other
pretexts
,
always
trying
to
make
himself
*NL*
agreeable
,
useful
,
``
enfeoffing
himself
,
''
as
Homais
would
have
said
,
and
*NL*
always
dropping
some
hint
to
Emma
about
the
power
of
attorney
.
He
never
*NL*
mentioned
the
bill
;
she
did
not
think
of
it
.
Charles
,
at
the
beginning
*NL*
of
her
convalescence
,
had
certainly
said
something
about
it
to
her
,
*NL*
but
so
many
emotions
had
passed
through
her
head
that
she
no
longer
*NL*
remembered
it
.
Besides
,
she
took
care
not
to
talk
of
any
money
*NL*
questions
.
Madame
Bovary
seemed
surprised
at
this
,
and
attributed
the
*NL*
change
in
her
ways
to
the
religious
sentiments
she
had
contracted
during
*NL*
her
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
Emma
greatly
astounded
Bovary
by
her
*NL*
practical
good
sense
.
It
would
be
necessary
to
make
inquiries
,
to
look
*NL*
into
mortgages
,
and
see
if
there
were
any
occasion
for
a
sale
by
auction
*NL*
or
a
liquidation
.
She
quoted
technical
terms
casually
,
pronounced
the
*NL*
grand
words
of
order
,
the
future
,
foresight
,
and
constantly
exaggerated
*NL*
the
difficulties
of
settling
his
father
's
affairs
so
much
,
that
at
last
*NL*
one
day
she
showed
him
the
rough
draft
of
a
power
of
attorney
to
manage
*NL*
and
administer
his
business
,
arrange
all
loans
,
sign
and
endorse
all
*NL*
bills
,
pay
all
sums
,
etc.
.
She
had
profited
by
Lheureux
's
lessons
.
*NL*
Charles
naively
asked
her
where
this
paper
came
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Guillaumin
''
;
and
with
the
utmost
coolness
she
added
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
trust
him
overmuch
.
Notaries
have
such
a
bad
reputation
.
Perhaps
we
*NL*
ought
to
consult
--
we
only
know
--
no
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
Leon
--
''
replied
Charles
,
who
was
reflecting
.
But
it
was
*NL*
difficult
to
explain
matters
by
letter
.
Then
she
offered
to
make
the
*NL*
journey
,
but
he
thanked
her
.
She
insisted
.
It
was
quite
a
contest
of
*NL*
mutual
consideration
.
At
last
she
cried
with
affected
waywardness
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
will
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
you
are
!
''
he
said
,
kissing
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
she
set
out
in
the
``
Hirondelle
''
to
go
to
Rouen
to
*NL*
consult
Monsieur
Leon
,
and
she
stayed
there
three
days
.

Chapter
Three
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
three
full
,
exquisite
days
--
a
true
honeymoon
.
They
were
at
*NL*
the
Hotel-de-Boulogne
,
on
the
harbour
;
and
they
lived
there
,
with
drawn
*NL*
blinds
and
closed
doors
,
with
flowers
on
the
floor
,
and
iced
syrups
were
*NL*
brought
them
early
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
they
took
a
covered
boat
and
went
to
dine
on
one
of
the
*NL*
islands
.
It
was
the
time
when
one
hears
by
the
side
of
the
dockyard
the
*NL*
caulking-mallets
sounding
against
the
hull
of
vessels
.
The
smoke
of
*NL*
the
tar
rose
up
between
the
trees
;
there
were
large
fatty
drops
on
the
*NL*
water
,
undulating
in
the
purple
colour
of
the
sun
,
like
floating
plaques
*NL*
of
Florentine
bronze
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
rowed
down
in
the
midst
of
moored
boats
,
whose
long
oblique
cables
*NL*
grazed
lightly
against
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
The
din
of
the
town
*NL*
gradually
grew
distant
;
the
rolling
of
carriages
,
the
tumult
of
voices
,
*NL*
the
yelping
of
dogs
on
the
decks
of
vessels
.
She
took
off
her
bonnet
,
*NL*
and
they
landed
on
their
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
in
the
low-ceilinged
room
of
a
tavern
,
at
whose
door
hung
*NL*
black
nets
.
They
ate
fried
smelts
,
cream
and
cherries
.
They
lay
down
*NL*
upon
the
grass
;
they
kissed
behind
the
poplars
;
and
they
would
fain
,
*NL*
like
two
Robinsons
,
have
lived
for
ever
in
this
little
place
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
them
in
their
beatitude
the
most
magnificent
on
earth
.
It
was
*NL*
not
the
first
time
that
they
had
seen
trees
,
a
blue
sky
,
meadows
;
that
*NL*
they
had
heard
the
water
flowing
and
the
wind
blowing
in
the
leaves
;
*NL*
but
,
no
doubt
,
they
had
never
admired
all
this
,
as
if
Nature
had
*NL*
not
existed
before
,
or
had
only
begun
to
be
beautiful
since
the
*NL*
gratification
of
their
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
they
returned
.
The
boat
glided
along
the
shores
of
the
islands
.
*NL*
They
sat
at
the
bottom
,
both
hidden
by
the
shade
,
in
silence
.
The
square
*NL*
oars
rang
in
the
iron
thwarts
,
and
,
in
the
stillness
,
seemed
to
mark
*NL*
time
,
like
the
beating
of
a
metronome
,
while
at
the
stern
the
rudder
*NL*
that
trailed
behind
never
ceased
its
gentle
splash
against
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
the
moon
rose
;
they
did
not
fail
to
make
fine
phrases
,
finding
the
*NL*
orb
melancholy
and
full
of
poetry
.
She
even
began
to
sing
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
,
do
you
remember
,
we
were
sailing
,
''
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
musical
but
weak
voice
died
away
along
the
waves
,
and
the
winds
*NL*
carried
off
the
trills
that
Leon
heard
pass
like
the
flapping
of
wings
*NL*
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
opposite
him
,
leaning
against
the
partition
of
the
shallop
,
*NL*
through
one
of
whose
raised
blinds
the
moon
streamed
in
.
Her
black
*NL*
dress
,
whose
drapery
spread
out
like
a
fan
,
made
her
seem
more
slender
,
*NL*
taller
.
Her
head
was
raised
,
her
hands
clasped
,
her
eyes
turned
towards
*NL*
heaven
.
At
times
the
shadow
of
the
willows
hid
her
completely
;
then
she
*NL*
reappeared
suddenly
,
like
a
vision
in
the
moonlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
,
on
the
floor
by
her
side
,
found
under
his
hand
a
ribbon
of
scarlet
*NL*
silk
.
The
boatman
looked
at
it
,
and
at
last
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
belongs
to
the
party
I
took
out
the
other
day
.
A
lot
*NL*
of
jolly
folk
,
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
with
cakes
,
champagne
,
*NL*
cornets
--
everything
in
style
!
There
was
one
especially
,
a
tall
handsome
*NL*
man
with
small
moustaches
,
who
was
that
funny
!
And
they
all
kept
saying
,
*NL*
`
Now
tell
us
something
,
Adolphe
--
Dolpe
,
'
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
pain
?
''
asked
Leon
,
coming
closer
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
!
No
doubt
,
it
is
only
the
night
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
does
n't
want
for
women
,
either
,
''
softly
added
the
sailor
,
*NL*
thinking
he
was
paying
the
stranger
a
compliment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
spitting
on
his
hands
,
he
took
the
oars
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
they
had
to
part
.
The
adieux
were
sad
.
He
was
to
send
his
letters
to
*NL*
Mere
Rollet
,
and
she
gave
him
such
precise
instructions
about
a
double
*NL*
envelope
that
he
admired
greatly
her
amorous
astuteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
can
assure
me
it
is
all
right
?
''
she
said
with
her
last
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
''
he
thought
afterwards
as
he
came
back
through
the
streets
*NL*
alone
,
``
is
she
so
very
anxious
to
get
this
power
of
attorney
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Four
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
soon
put
on
an
air
of
superiority
before
his
comrades
,
avoided
*NL*
their
company
,
and
completely
neglected
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
for
her
letters
;
he
re-read
them
;
he
wrote
to
her
.
He
called
*NL*
her
to
mind
with
all
the
strength
of
his
desires
and
of
his
memories
.
*NL*
Instead
of
lessening
with
absence
,
this
longing
to
see
her
again
grew
,
*NL*
so
that
at
last
on
Saturday
morning
he
escaped
from
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
he
saw
in
the
valley
below
the
*NL*
church-spire
with
its
tin
flag
swinging
in
the
wind
,
he
felt
that
*NL*
delight
mingled
with
triumphant
vanity
and
egoistic
tenderness
that
*NL*
millionaires
must
experience
when
they
come
back
to
their
native
*NL*
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
rambling
round
her
house
.
A
light
was
burning
in
the
kitchen
.
He
*NL*
watched
for
her
shadow
behind
the
curtains
,
but
nothing
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mere
Lefrancois
,
when
she
saw
him
,
uttered
many
exclamations
.
She
*NL*
thought
he
``
had
grown
and
was
thinner
,
''
while
Artemise
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
thought
him
stouter
and
darker
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dined
in
the
little
room
as
of
yore
,
but
alone
,
without
the
*NL*
tax-gatherer
;
for
Binet
,
tired
of
waiting
for
the
``
Hirondelle
,
''
had
*NL*
definitely
put
forward
his
meal
one
hour
,
and
now
he
dined
punctually
at
*NL*
five
,
and
yet
he
declared
usually
the
rickety
old
concern
``
was
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
,
however
,
made
up
his
mind
,
and
knocked
at
the
doctor
's
door
.
*NL*
Madame
was
in
her
room
,
and
did
not
come
down
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
The
doctor
seemed
delighted
to
see
him
,
but
he
never
stirred
out
that
*NL*
evening
,
nor
all
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
alone
in
the
evening
,
very
late
,
behind
the
garden
in
the
*NL*
lane
;
in
the
lane
,
as
she
had
the
other
one
!
It
was
a
stormy
night
,
and
*NL*
they
talked
under
an
umbrella
by
lightning
flashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
separation
was
becoming
intolerable
.
``
I
would
rather
die
!
''
said
*NL*
Emma
.
She
was
writhing
in
his
arms
,
weeping
.
``
Adieu
!
adieu
!
When
shall
I
*NL*
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
back
again
to
embrace
once
more
,
and
it
was
then
that
*NL*
she
promised
him
to
find
soon
,
by
no
matter
what
means
,
a
regular
*NL*
opportunity
for
seeing
one
another
in
freedom
at
least
once
a
week
.
Emma
*NL*
never
doubted
she
should
be
able
to
do
this
.
Besides
,
she
was
full
of
*NL*
hope
.
Some
money
was
coming
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
strength
of
it
she
bought
a
pair
of
yellow
curtains
with
large
*NL*
stripes
for
her
room
,
whose
cheapness
Monsieur
Lheureux
had
commended
;
*NL*
she
dreamed
of
getting
a
carpet
,
and
Lheureux
,
declaring
that
it
was
n't
*NL*
``
drinking
the
sea
,
''
politely
undertook
to
supply
her
with
one
.
She
could
*NL*
no
longer
do
without
his
services
.
Twenty
times
a
day
she
sent
for
him
,
*NL*
and
he
at
once
put
by
his
business
without
a
murmur
.
People
could
not
*NL*
understand
either
why
Mere
Rollet
breakfasted
with
her
every
day
,
and
*NL*
even
paid
her
private
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
beginning
of
winter
,
that
*NL*
she
seemed
seized
with
great
musical
fervour
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
Charles
was
listening
to
her
,
she
began
the
same
piece
*NL*
four
times
over
,
each
time
with
much
vexation
,
while
he
,
not
noticing
*NL*
any
difference
,
cried
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
very
goodl
You
are
wrong
to
stop
.
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
it
is
execrable
!
My
fingers
are
quite
rusty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
begged
her
to
play
him
something
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
to
please
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Charles
confessed
she
had
gone
off
a
little
.
She
played
wrong
notes
*NL*
and
blundered
;
then
,
stopping
short
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
is
no
use
.
I
ought
to
take
some
lessons
;
but
--
''
She
bit
her
lips
*NL*
and
added
,
``
Twenty
francs
a
lesson
,
that
's
too
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
it
is
--
rather
,
''
said
Charles
,
giggling
stupidly
.
``
But
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
that
one
might
be
able
to
do
it
for
less
;
for
there
are
artists
of
*NL*
no
reputation
,
and
who
are
often
better
than
the
celebrities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
them
!
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
when
he
came
home
he
looked
at
her
shyly
,
and
at
last
could
*NL*
no
longer
keep
back
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
obstinate
you
are
sometimes
!
I
went
to
Barfucheres
to-day
.
Well
,
*NL*
Madame
Liegard
assured
me
that
her
three
young
ladies
who
are
at
*NL*
La
Misericorde
have
lessons
at
fifty
sous
apiece
,
and
that
from
an
*NL*
excellent
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
did
not
open
her
piano
again
.
But
when
*NL*
she
passed
by
it
-LRB-
if
Bovary
were
there
-RRB-
,
she
sighed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
poor
piano
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
anyone
came
to
see
her
,
she
did
not
fail
to
inform
them
she
*NL*
had
given
up
music
,
and
could
not
begin
again
now
for
important
reasons
.
*NL*
Then
people
commiserated
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
!
she
had
so
much
talent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
even
spoke
to
Bovary
about
it
.
They
put
him
to
shame
,
and
*NL*
especially
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
.
One
should
never
let
any
of
the
faculties
of
nature
lie
*NL*
fallow
.
Besides
,
just
think
,
my
good
friend
,
that
by
inducing
madame
to
*NL*
study
;
you
are
economising
on
the
subsequent
musical
education
of
*NL*
your
child
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
think
that
mothers
ought
themselves
to
*NL*
instruct
their
children
.
That
is
an
idea
of
Rousseau
's
,
still
rather
*NL*
new
perhaps
,
but
that
will
end
by
triumphing
,
I
am
certain
of
it
,
like
*NL*
mothers
nursing
their
own
children
and
vaccination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Charles
returned
once
more
to
this
question
of
the
piano
.
Emma
*NL*
replied
bitterly
that
it
would
be
better
to
sell
it
.
This
poor
piano
,
*NL*
that
had
given
her
vanity
so
much
satisfaction
--
to
see
it
go
was
to
*NL*
Bovary
like
the
indefinable
suicide
of
a
part
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
liked
,
''
he
said
,
``
a
lesson
from
time
to
time
,
that
would
n't
*NL*
after
all
be
very
ruinous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
lessons
,
''
she
replied
,
``
are
only
of
use
when
followed
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
it
was
she
set
about
obtaining
her
husband
's
permission
to
go
*NL*
to
town
once
a
week
to
see
her
lover
.
At
the
end
of
a
month
she
was
even
*NL*
considered
to
have
made
considerable
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Five
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
Thursdays
.
She
got
up
and
dressed
silently
,
in
order
not
to
*NL*
awaken
Charles
,
who
would
have
made
remarks
about
her
getting
ready
too
*NL*
early
.
Next
she
walked
up
and
down
,
went
to
the
windows
,
and
looked
out
*NL*
at
the
Place
.
The
early
dawn
was
broadening
between
the
pillars
of
the
*NL*
market
,
and
the
chemist
's
shop
,
with
the
shutters
still
up
,
showed
in
*NL*
the
pale
light
of
the
dawn
the
large
letters
of
his
signboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
clock
pointed
to
a
quarter
past
seven
,
she
went
off
to
the
*NL*
``
Lion
d'Or
,
''
whose
door
Artemise
opened
yawning
.
The
girl
then
made
*NL*
up
the
coals
covered
by
the
cinders
,
and
Emma
remained
alone
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
Now
and
again
she
went
out
.
Hivert
was
leisurely
harnessing
his
*NL*
horses
,
listening
,
moreover
,
to
Mere
Lefrancois
,
who
,
passing
her
head
*NL*
and
nightcap
through
a
grating
,
was
charging
him
with
commissions
and
*NL*
giving
him
explanations
that
would
have
confused
anyone
else
.
Emma
kept
*NL*
beating
the
soles
of
her
boots
against
the
pavement
of
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
when
he
had
eaten
his
soup
,
put
on
his
cloak
,
lighted
his
pipe
,
*NL*
and
grasped
his
whip
,
he
calmly
installed
himself
on
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
Hirondelle
''
started
at
a
slow
trot
,
and
for
about
a
mile
stopped
*NL*
here
and
there
to
pick
up
passengers
who
waited
for
it
,
standing
at
the
*NL*
border
of
the
road
,
in
front
of
their
yard
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
had
secured
seats
the
evening
before
kept
it
waiting
;
some
*NL*
even
were
still
in
bed
in
their
houses
.
Hivert
called
,
shouted
,
swore
;
*NL*
then
he
got
down
from
his
seat
and
went
and
knocked
loudly
at
the
doors
.
*NL*
The
wind
blew
through
the
cracked
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
seats
,
however
,
filled
up
.
The
carriage
rolled
off
;
rows
of
*NL*
apple-trees
followed
one
upon
another
,
and
the
road
between
its
two
long
*NL*
ditches
,
full
of
yellow
water
,
rose
,
constantly
narrowing
towards
the
*NL*
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
knew
it
from
end
to
end
;
she
knew
that
after
a
meadow
there
was
*NL*
a
sign-post
,
next
an
elm
,
a
barn
,
or
the
hut
of
a
lime-kiln
tender
.
*NL*
Sometimes
even
,
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
surprise
,
she
shut
her
eyes
,
*NL*
but
she
never
lost
the
clear
perception
of
the
distance
to
be
traversed
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
brick
houses
began
to
follow
one
another
more
closely
,
the
*NL*
earth
resounded
beneath
the
wheels
,
the
``
Hirondelle
''
glided
between
the
*NL*
gardens
,
where
through
an
opening
one
saw
statues
,
a
periwinkle
plant
,
*NL*
clipped
yews
,
and
a
swing
.
Then
on
a
sudden
the
town
appeared
.
Sloping
*NL*
down
like
an
amphitheatre
,
and
drowned
in
the
fog
,
it
widened
out
*NL*
beyond
the
bridges
confusedly
.
Then
the
open
country
spread
away
with
*NL*
a
monotonous
movement
till
it
touched
in
the
distance
the
vague
line
of
*NL*
the
pale
sky
.
Seen
thus
from
above
,
the
whole
landscape
looked
immovable
*NL*
as
a
picture
;
the
anchored
ships
were
massed
in
one
corner
,
the
river
*NL*
curved
round
the
foot
of
the
green
hills
,
and
the
isles
,
oblique
in
*NL*
shape
,
lay
on
the
water
,
like
large
,
motionless
,
black
fishes
.
The
*NL*
factory
chimneys
belched
forth
immense
brown
fumes
that
were
blown
away
*NL*
at
the
top
.
One
heard
the
rumbling
of
the
foundries
,
together
with
the
*NL*
clear
chimes
of
the
churches
that
stood
out
in
the
mist
.
The
leafless
*NL*
trees
on
the
boulevards
made
violet
thickets
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
houses
,
and
the
roofs
,
all
shining
with
the
rain
,
threw
back
unequal
*NL*
reflections
,
according
to
the
height
of
the
quarters
in
which
they
were
.
*NL*
Sometimes
a
gust
of
wind
drove
the
clouds
towards
the
Saint
Catherine
*NL*
hills
,
like
aerial
waves
that
broke
silently
against
a
cliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
giddiness
seemed
to
her
to
detach
itself
from
this
mass
of
existence
,
*NL*
and
her
heart
swelled
as
if
the
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
souls
that
*NL*
palpitated
there
had
all
at
once
sent
into
it
the
vapour
of
the
passions
*NL*
she
fancied
theirs
.
Her
love
grew
in
the
presence
of
this
vastness
,
and
*NL*
expanded
with
tumult
to
the
vague
murmurings
that
rose
towards
her
.
She
*NL*
poured
it
out
upon
the
square
,
on
the
walks
,
on
the
streets
,
and
the
*NL*
old
Norman
city
outspread
before
her
eyes
as
an
enormous
capital
,
as
a
*NL*
Babylon
into
which
she
was
entering
.
She
leant
with
both
hands
against
*NL*
the
window
,
drinking
in
the
breeze
;
the
three
horses
galloped
,
the
*NL*
stones
grated
in
the
mud
,
the
diligence
rocked
,
and
Hivert
,
from
afar
,
*NL*
hailed
the
carts
on
the
road
,
while
the
bourgeois
who
had
spent
the
*NL*
night
at
the
Guillaume
woods
came
quietly
down
the
hill
in
their
little
*NL*
family
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
at
the
barrier
;
Emma
undid
her
overshoes
,
put
on
other
*NL*
gloves
,
rearranged
her
shawl
,
and
some
twenty
paces
farther
she
got
down
*NL*
from
the
``
Hirondelle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
was
then
awakening
.
Shop-boys
in
caps
were
cleaning
up
the
*NL*
shop-fronts
,
and
women
with
baskets
against
their
hips
,
at
intervals
*NL*
uttered
sonorous
cries
at
the
corners
of
streets
.
She
walked
with
*NL*
downcast
eyes
,
close
to
the
walls
,
and
smiling
with
pleasure
under
her
*NL*
lowered
black
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
fear
of
being
seen
,
she
did
not
usually
take
the
most
direct
road
.
*NL*
She
plunged
into
dark
alleys
,
and
,
all
perspiring
,
reached
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
Rue
Nationale
,
near
the
fountain
that
stands
there
.
It
is
the
*NL*
quarter
for
theatres
,
public-houses
,
and
whores
.
Often
a
cart
would
*NL*
pass
near
her
,
bearing
some
shaking
scenery
.
Waiters
in
aprons
were
*NL*
sprinkling
sand
on
the
flagstones
between
green
shrubs
.
It
all
smelt
of
*NL*
absinthe
,
cigars
,
and
oysters
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
down
a
street
;
she
recognised
him
by
his
curling
hair
that
*NL*
escaped
from
beneath
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
walked
along
the
pavement
.
She
followed
him
to
the
hotel
.
He
went
*NL*
up
,
opened
the
door
,
entered
--
What
an
embrace
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
after
the
kisses
,
the
words
gushed
forth
.
They
told
each
other
the
*NL*
sorrows
of
the
week
,
the
presentiments
,
the
anxiety
for
the
letters
;
but
*NL*
now
everything
was
forgotten
;
they
gazed
into
each
other
's
faces
with
*NL*
voluptuous
laughs
,
and
tender
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bed
was
large
,
of
mahogany
,
in
the
shape
of
a
boat
.
The
curtains
*NL*
were
in
red
levantine
,
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
bulged
out
too
*NL*
much
towards
the
bell-shaped
bedside
;
and
nothing
in
the
world
was
so
*NL*
lovely
as
her
brown
head
and
white
skin
standing
out
against
this
purple
*NL*
colour
,
when
,
with
a
movement
of
shame
,
she
crossed
her
bare
arms
,
*NL*
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
warm
room
,
with
its
discreet
carpet
,
its
gay
ornaments
,
and
its
*NL*
calm
light
,
seemed
made
for
the
intimacies
of
passion
.
The
curtain-rods
,
*NL*
ending
in
arrows
,
their
brass
pegs
,
and
the
great
balls
of
the
fire-dogs
*NL*
shone
suddenly
when
the
sun
came
in
.
On
the
chimney
between
the
*NL*
candelabra
there
were
two
of
those
pink
shells
in
which
one
hears
the
*NL*
murmur
of
the
sea
if
one
holds
them
to
the
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
they
loved
that
dear
room
,
so
full
of
gaiety
,
despite
its
rather
*NL*
faded
splendour
!
They
always
found
the
furniture
in
the
same
place
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
hairpins
,
that
she
had
forgotten
the
Thursday
before
,
under
*NL*
the
pedestal
of
the
clock
.
They
lunched
by
the
fireside
on
a
little
*NL*
round
table
,
inlaid
with
rosewood
.
Emma
carved
,
put
bits
on
his
plate
*NL*
with
all
sorts
of
coquettish
ways
,
and
she
laughed
with
a
sonorous
and
*NL*
libertine
laugh
when
the
froth
of
the
champagne
ran
over
from
the
*NL*
glass
to
the
rings
on
her
fingers
.
They
were
so
completely
lost
in
*NL*
the
possession
of
each
other
that
they
thought
themselves
in
their
*NL*
own
house
,
and
that
they
would
live
there
till
death
,
like
two
spouses
*NL*
eternally
young
.
They
said
``
our
room
,
''
``
our
carpet
,
''
she
even
said
``
my
*NL*
slippers
,
''
a
gift
of
Leon
's
,
a
whim
she
had
had
.
They
were
pink
satin
,
*NL*
bordered
with
swansdown
.
When
she
sat
on
his
knees
,
her
leg
,
then
too
*NL*
short
,
hung
in
the
air
,
and
the
dainty
shoe
,
that
had
no
back
to
it
,
was
*NL*
held
only
by
the
toes
to
her
bare
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
for
the
first
time
enjoyed
the
inexpressible
delicacy
of
feminine
*NL*
refinements
.
He
had
never
met
this
grace
of
language
,
this
reserve
of
*NL*
clothing
,
these
poses
of
the
weary
dove
.
He
admired
the
exaltation
of
*NL*
her
soul
and
the
lace
on
her
petticoat
.
Besides
,
was
she
not
``
a
lady
''
*NL*
and
a
married
woman
--
a
real
mistress
,
in
fine
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
diversity
of
her
humour
,
in
turn
mystical
or
mirthful
,
talkative
,
*NL*
taciturn
,
passionate
,
careless
,
she
awakened
in
him
a
thousand
desires
,
*NL*
called
up
instincts
or
memories
.
She
was
the
mistress
of
all
the
novels
,
*NL*
the
heroine
of
all
the
dramas
,
the
vague
``
she
''
of
all
the
volumes
*NL*
of
verse
.
He
found
again
on
her
shoulder
the
amber
colouring
of
the
*NL*
``
Odalisque
Bathing
''
;
she
had
the
long
waist
of
feudal
chatelaines
,
and
*NL*
she
resembled
the
``
Pale
Woman
of
Barcelona
.
''
But
above
all
she
was
the
*NL*
Angel
!
*NL*
*NL*
Often
looking
at
her
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
soul
,
escaping
towards
*NL*
her
,
spread
like
a
wave
about
the
outline
of
her
head
,
and
descended
*NL*
drawn
down
into
the
whiteness
of
her
breast
.
He
knelt
on
the
ground
*NL*
before
her
,
and
with
both
elbows
on
her
knees
looked
at
her
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
his
face
upturned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
over
him
,
and
murmured
,
as
if
choking
with
intoxication
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
move
!
do
not
speak
!
look
at
me
!
Something
so
sweet
comes
*NL*
from
your
eyes
that
helps
me
so
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
called
him
``
child
.
''
``
Child
,
do
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
did
not
listen
for
his
answer
in
the
haste
of
her
lips
that
*NL*
fastened
to
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
clock
there
was
a
bronze
cupid
,
who
smirked
as
he
bent
his
arm
*NL*
beneath
a
golden
garland
.
They
had
laughed
at
it
many
a
time
,
but
when
*NL*
they
had
to
part
everything
seemed
serious
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Motionless
in
front
of
each
other
,
they
kept
repeating
,
``
Till
Thursday
,
*NL*
till
Thursday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
seized
his
head
between
her
hands
,
kissed
him
hurriedly
on
*NL*
the
forehead
,
crying
,
``
Adieu
!
''
and
rushed
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
a
hairdresser
's
in
the
Rue
de
la
Comedie
to
have
her
hair
*NL*
arranged
.
Night
fell
;
the
gas
was
lighted
in
the
shop
.
She
heard
the
*NL*
bell
at
the
theatre
calling
the
mummers
to
the
performance
,
and
she
saw
,
*NL*
passing
opposite
,
men
with
white
faces
and
women
in
faded
gowns
going
in
*NL*
at
the
stage-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hot
in
the
room
,
small
,
and
too
low
where
the
stove
was
hissing
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
wigs
and
pomades
.
The
smell
of
the
tongs
,
together
with
*NL*
the
greasy
hands
that
handled
her
head
,
soon
stunned
her
,
and
she
dozed
*NL*
a
little
in
her
wrapper
.
Often
,
as
he
did
her
hair
,
the
man
offered
her
*NL*
tickets
for
a
masked
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
went
away
.
She
went
up
the
streets
;
reached
the
Croix-Rouge
,
*NL*
put
on
her
overshoes
,
that
she
had
hidden
in
the
morning
under
the
seat
,
*NL*
and
sank
into
her
place
among
the
impatient
passengers
.
Some
got
out
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
She
remained
alone
in
the
carriage
.
At
every
*NL*
turning
all
the
lights
of
the
town
were
seen
more
and
more
completely
,
*NL*
making
a
great
luminous
vapour
about
the
dim
houses
.
Emma
knelt
on
the
*NL*
cushions
and
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
dazzling
light
.
She
sobbed
;
*NL*
called
on
Leon
,
sent
him
tender
words
and
kisses
lost
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
hillside
a
poor
devil
wandered
about
with
his
stick
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
diligences
.
A
mass
of
rags
covered
his
shoulders
,
and
an
old
*NL*
staved-in
beaver
,
turned
out
like
a
basin
,
hid
his
face
;
but
when
he
*NL*
took
it
off
he
discovered
in
the
place
of
eyelids
empty
and
bloody
*NL*
orbits
.
The
flesh
hung
in
red
shreds
,
and
there
flowed
from
it
liquids
*NL*
that
congealed
into
green
scale
down
to
the
nose
,
whose
black
nostrils
*NL*
sniffed
convulsively
.
To
speak
to
you
he
threw
back
his
head
with
an
*NL*
idiotic
laugh
;
then
his
bluish
eyeballs
,
rolling
constantly
,
at
the
*NL*
temples
beat
against
the
edge
of
the
open
wound
.
He
sang
a
little
song
*NL*
as
he
followed
the
carriages
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maids
an
the
warmth
of
a
summer
day
Dream
of
love
,
and
of
love
always
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
the
rest
was
about
birds
and
sunshine
and
green
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
appeared
suddenly
behind
Emma
,
bareheaded
,
and
she
drew
*NL*
back
with
a
cry
.
Hivert
made
fun
of
him
.
He
would
advise
him
to
get
a
*NL*
booth
at
the
Saint
Romain
fair
,
or
else
ask
him
,
laughing
,
how
his
young
*NL*
woman
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
they
had
started
when
,
with
a
sudden
movement
,
his
hat
entered
the
*NL*
diligence
through
the
small
window
,
while
he
clung
with
his
other
arm
*NL*
to
the
footboard
,
between
the
wheels
splashing
mud
.
His
voice
,
feeble
*NL*
at
first
and
quavering
,
grew
sharp
;
it
resounded
in
the
night
like
the
*NL*
indistinct
moan
of
a
vague
distress
;
and
through
the
ringing
of
the
*NL*
bells
,
the
murmur
of
the
trees
,
and
the
rumbling
of
the
empty
vehicle
,
*NL*
it
had
a
far-off
sound
that
disturbed
Emma
.
It
went
to
the
bottom
of
*NL*
her
soul
,
like
a
whirlwind
in
an
abyss
,
and
carried
her
away
into
the
*NL*
distances
of
a
boundless
melancholy
.
But
Hivert
,
noticing
a
weight
*NL*
behind
,
gave
the
blind
man
sharp
cuts
with
his
whip
.
The
thong
lashed
*NL*
his
wounds
,
and
he
fell
back
into
the
mud
with
a
yell
.
Then
the
*NL*
passengers
in
the
``
Hirondelle
''
ended
by
falling
asleep
,
some
with
open
*NL*
mouths
,
others
with
lowered
chins
,
leaning
against
their
neighbour
's
*NL*
shoulder
,
or
with
their
arm
passed
through
the
strap
,
oscillating
*NL*
regularly
with
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
;
and
the
reflection
of
the
*NL*
lantern
swinging
without
,
on
the
crupper
of
the
wheeler
;
penetrating
*NL*
into
the
interior
through
the
chocolate
calico
curtains
,
threw
*NL*
sanguineous
shadows
over
all
these
motionless
people
.
Emma
,
drunk
with
*NL*
grief
,
shivered
in
her
clothes
,
feeling
her
feet
grow
colder
and
colder
,
*NL*
and
death
in
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
at
home
was
waiting
for
her
;
the
``
Hirondelle
''
was
always
late
*NL*
on
Thursdays
.
Madame
arrived
at
last
,
and
scarcely
kissed
the
child
.
The
*NL*
dinner
was
not
ready
.
No
matter
!
She
excused
the
servant
.
This
girl
now
*NL*
seemed
allowed
to
do
just
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
her
husband
,
noting
her
pallor
,
asked
if
she
were
unwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
replied
,
``
you
seem
so
strange
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
!
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
even
days
when
she
had
no
sooner
come
in
than
she
went
up
to
*NL*
her
room
;
and
Justin
,
happening
to
be
there
,
moved
about
noiselessly
,
*NL*
quicker
at
helping
her
than
the
best
of
maids
.
He
put
the
matches
*NL*
ready
,
the
candlestick
,
a
book
,
arranged
her
nightgown
,
turned
back
the
*NL*
bedclothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
she
,
``
that
will
do
.
Now
you
can
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
he
stood
there
,
his
hands
hanging
down
and
his
eyes
wide
open
,
as
if
*NL*
enmeshed
in
the
innumerable
threads
of
a
sudden
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
was
frightful
,
and
those
that
came
after
still
more
*NL*
unbearable
,
because
of
her
impatience
to
once
again
seize
her
happiness
;
*NL*
an
ardent
lust
,
inflamed
by
the
images
of
past
experience
,
and
that
*NL*
burst
forth
freely
on
the
seventh
day
beneath
Leon
's
caresses
.
His
*NL*
ardours
were
hidden
beneath
outbursts
of
wonder
and
gratitude
.
Emma
*NL*
tasted
this
love
in
a
discreet
,
absorbed
fashion
,
maintained
it
by
all
*NL*
the
artifices
of
her
tenderness
,
and
trembled
a
little
lest
it
should
be
*NL*
lost
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
said
to
him
,
with
her
sweet
,
melancholy
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
too
,
you
will
leave
me
!
You
will
marry
!
You
will
be
like
all
*NL*
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
,
``
What
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
like
all
men
,
''
she
replied
.
Then
added
,
repulsing
him
with
a
*NL*
languid
movement
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
all
evil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
they
were
talking
philosophically
of
earthly
disillusions
,
*NL*
to
experiment
on
his
jealousy
,
or
yielding
,
perhaps
,
to
an
over-strong
*NL*
need
to
pour
out
her
heart
,
she
told
him
that
formerly
,
before
him
,
she
*NL*
had
loved
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
like
you
,
''
she
went
on
quickly
,
protesting
by
the
head
of
her
child
*NL*
that
``
nothing
had
passed
between
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
believed
her
,
but
none
the
less
questioned
her
to
find
out
*NL*
what
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
ship
's
captain
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Was
this
not
preventing
any
inquiry
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
assuming
a
*NL*
higher
ground
through
this
pretended
fascination
exercised
over
a
man
*NL*
who
must
have
been
of
warlike
nature
and
accustomed
to
receive
homage
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
then
felt
the
lowliness
of
his
position
;
he
longed
for
*NL*
epaulettes
,
crosses
,
titles
.
All
that
would
please
her
--
he
gathered
that
*NL*
from
her
spendthrift
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
nevertheless
concealed
many
of
these
extravagant
fancies
,
such
as
*NL*
her
wish
to
have
a
blue
tilbury
to
drive
into
Rouen
,
drawn
by
an
English
*NL*
horse
and
driven
by
a
groom
in
top-boots
.
It
was
Justin
who
had
inspired
*NL*
her
with
this
whim
,
by
begging
her
to
take
him
into
her
service
as
*NL*
valet-de-chambre
*
,
and
if
the
privation
of
it
did
not
lessen
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
her
arrival
at
each
rendezvous
,
it
certainly
augmented
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
the
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Manservant
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
when
they
talked
together
of
Paris
,
she
ended
by
murmuring
,
``
Ah
!
*NL*
how
happy
we
should
be
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
not
happy
?
''
gently
answered
the
young
man
passing
his
hands
over
*NL*
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
true
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
am
mad
.
Kiss
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
husband
she
was
more
charming
than
ever
.
She
made
him
*NL*
pistachio-creams
,
and
played
him
waltzes
after
dinner
.
So
he
thought
*NL*
himself
the
most
fortunate
of
men
and
Emma
was
without
uneasiness
,
when
,
*NL*
one
evening
suddenly
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Mademoiselle
Lempereur
,
is
n't
it
,
who
gives
you
lessons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
saw
her
just
now
,
''
Charles
went
on
,
``
at
Madame
Liegeard
's
.
I
*NL*
spoke
to
her
about
you
,
and
she
does
n't
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
like
a
thunderclap
.
However
,
she
replied
quite
naturally
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
no
doubt
she
forgot
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
there
are
several
Demoiselles
Lempereur
*NL*
at
Rouen
who
are
music-mistresses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
!
''
Then
quickly
--
``
But
I
have
my
receipts
here
.
See
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
to
the
writing-table
,
ransacked
all
the
drawers
,
rummaged
*NL*
the
papers
,
and
at
last
lost
her
head
so
completely
that
Charles
*NL*
earnestly
begged
her
not
to
take
so
much
trouble
about
those
wretched
*NL*
receipts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
find
them
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
in
fact
,
on
the
following
Friday
,
as
Charles
was
putting
on
one
*NL*
of
his
boots
in
the
dark
cabinet
where
his
clothes
were
kept
,
he
felt
*NL*
a
piece
of
paper
between
the
leather
and
his
sock
.
He
took
it
out
and
*NL*
read
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Received
,
for
three
months
'
lessons
and
several
pieces
of
music
,
the
*NL*
sum
of
sixty-three
francs
.
--
Felicie
Lempereur
,
professor
of
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
the
devil
did
it
get
into
my
boots
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
,
''
she
replied
,
``
have
fallen
from
the
old
box
of
bills
that
is
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
shelf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
her
existence
was
but
one
long
tissue
of
lies
,
in
which
*NL*
she
enveloped
her
love
as
in
veils
to
hide
it
.
It
was
a
want
,
a
mania
,
*NL*
a
pleasure
carried
to
such
an
extent
that
if
she
said
she
had
the
day
*NL*
before
walked
on
the
right
side
of
a
road
,
one
might
know
she
had
taken
*NL*
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
when
she
had
gone
,
as
usual
,
rather
lightly
clothed
,
it
*NL*
suddenly
began
to
snow
,
and
as
Charles
was
watching
the
weather
from
the
*NL*
window
,
he
caught
sight
of
Monsieur
Bournisien
in
the
chaise
of
Monsieur
*NL*
Tuvache
,
who
was
driving
him
to
Rouen
.
Then
he
went
down
to
give
the
*NL*
priest
a
thick
shawl
that
he
was
to
hand
over
to
Emma
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
reached
the
``
Croix-Rouge
.
''
When
he
got
to
the
inn
,
Monsieur
Bournisien
*NL*
asked
for
the
wife
of
the
Yonville
doctor
.
The
landlady
replied
that
*NL*
she
very
rarely
came
to
her
establishment
.
So
that
evening
,
when
he
*NL*
recognised
Madame
Bovary
in
the
``
Hirondelle
,
''
the
cure
told
her
his
*NL*
dilemma
,
without
,
however
,
appearing
to
attach
much
importance
to
it
,
*NL*
for
he
began
praising
a
preacher
who
was
doing
wonders
at
the
Cathedral
,
*NL*
and
whom
all
the
ladies
were
rushing
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
if
he
did
not
ask
for
any
explanation
,
others
,
later
on
,
might
*NL*
prove
less
discreet
.
So
she
thought
well
to
get
down
each
time
at
the
*NL*
``
Croix-Rouge
,
''
so
that
the
good
folk
of
her
village
who
saw
her
on
the
*NL*
stairs
should
suspect
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
however
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
met
her
coming
out
of
the
Hotel
*NL*
de
Boulogne
on
Leon
's
arm
;
and
she
was
frightened
,
thinking
he
would
*NL*
gossip
.
He
was
not
such
a
fool
.
But
three
days
after
he
came
to
her
*NL*
room
,
shut
the
door
,
and
said
,
``
I
must
have
some
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
declared
she
could
not
give
him
any
.
Lheureux
burst
into
*NL*
lamentations
and
reminded
her
of
all
the
kindnesses
he
had
shown
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
of
the
two
bills
signed
by
Charles
,
Emma
up
to
the
present
had
*NL*
paid
only
one
.
As
to
the
second
,
the
shopkeeper
,
at
her
request
,
had
*NL*
consented
to
replace
it
by
another
,
which
again
had
been
renewed
for
a
*NL*
long
date
.
Then
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
list
of
goods
not
paid
for
;
to
*NL*
wit
,
the
curtains
,
the
carpet
,
the
material
for
the
armchairs
,
several
*NL*
dresses
,
and
divers
articles
of
dress
,
the
bills
for
which
amounted
to
*NL*
about
two
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
.
He
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
have
n't
any
ready
money
,
you
have
an
estate
.
''
And
he
*NL*
reminded
her
of
a
miserable
little
hovel
situated
at
Barneville
,
near
*NL*
Aumale
,
that
brought
in
almost
nothing
.
It
had
formerly
been
part
of
a
*NL*
small
farm
sold
by
Monsieur
Bovary
senior
;
for
Lheureux
knew
everything
,
*NL*
even
to
the
number
of
acres
and
the
names
of
the
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
in
your
place
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
should
clear
myself
of
my
debts
,
*NL*
and
have
money
left
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
out
the
difficulty
of
getting
a
purchaser
.
He
held
out
the
*NL*
hope
of
finding
one
;
but
she
asked
him
how
she
should
manage
to
sell
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
your
power
of
attorney
?
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phrase
came
to
her
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.
``
Leave
me
the
bill
,
''
*NL*
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
n't
worth
while
,
''
answered
Lheureux
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
back
the
following
week
and
boasted
of
having
,
after
much
*NL*
trouble
,
at
last
discovered
a
certain
Langlois
,
who
,
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
had
had
an
eye
on
the
property
,
but
without
mentioning
his
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
the
price
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
would
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
to
wait
,
to
sound
the
fellow
.
*NL*
The
thing
was
worth
a
journey
,
and
,
as
she
could
not
undertake
it
,
he
*NL*
offered
to
go
to
the
place
to
have
an
interview
with
Langlois
.
On
his
*NL*
return
he
announced
that
the
purchaser
proposed
four
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
radiant
at
this
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frankly
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
's
a
good
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
half
the
sum
at
once
,
and
when
she
was
about
to
pay
her
account
*NL*
the
shopkeeper
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
really
grieves
me
,
on
my
word
!
to
see
you
depriving
yourself
all
at
*NL*
once
of
such
a
big
sum
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
looked
at
the
bank-notes
,
and
dreaming
of
the
unlimited
number
*NL*
of
rendezvous
represented
by
those
two
thousand
francs
,
she
stammered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
what
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
went
on
,
laughing
good-naturedly
,
``
one
puts
anything
one
likes
*NL*
on
receipts
.
Do
n't
you
think
I
know
what
household
affairs
are
?
''
And
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
fixedly
,
while
in
his
hand
he
held
two
long
papers
that
he
*NL*
slid
between
his
nails
.
At
last
,
opening
his
pocket-book
,
he
spread
out
*NL*
on
the
table
four
bills
to
order
,
each
for
a
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sign
these
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
keep
it
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
out
,
scandalised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
give
you
the
surplus
,
''
replied
Monsieur
Lheureux
impudently
,
*NL*
``
is
that
not
helping
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
a
pen
he
wrote
at
the
bottom
of
the
account
,
``
Received
of
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
four
thousand
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
who
can
trouble
you
,
since
in
six
months
you
'll
draw
the
arrears
*NL*
for
your
cottage
,
and
I
do
n't
make
the
last
bill
due
till
after
you
've
*NL*
been
paid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
grew
rather
confused
in
her
calculations
,
and
her
ears
tingled
*NL*
as
if
gold
pieces
,
bursting
from
their
bags
,
rang
all
round
her
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
At
last
Lheureux
explained
that
he
had
a
very
good
friend
,
*NL*
Vincart
,
a
broker
at
Rouen
,
who
would
discount
these
four
bills
.
Then
*NL*
he
himself
would
hand
over
to
madame
the
remainder
after
the
actual
debt
*NL*
was
paid
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
instead
of
two
thousand
francs
he
brought
only
eighteen
hundred
,
for
*NL*
the
friend
Vincart
-LRB-
which
was
only
fair
-RRB-
had
deducted
two
hundred
francs
*NL*
for
commission
and
discount
.
Then
he
carelessly
asked
for
a
receipt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
--
in
business
--
sometimes
.
And
with
the
date
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
with
the
date
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
horizon
of
realisable
whims
opened
out
before
Emma
.
She
was
prudent
*NL*
enough
to
lay
by
a
thousand
crowns
,
with
which
the
first
three
bills
*NL*
were
paid
when
they
fell
due
;
but
the
fourth
,
by
chance
,
came
to
the
*NL*
house
on
a
Thursday
,
and
Charles
,
quite
upset
,
patiently
awaited
his
*NL*
wife
's
return
for
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
not
told
him
about
this
bill
,
it
was
only
to
spare
him
such
*NL*
domestic
worries
;
she
sat
on
his
knees
,
caressed
him
,
cooed
to
him
,
gave
*NL*
him
a
long
enumeration
of
all
the
indispensable
things
that
had
been
got
*NL*
on
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
you
must
confess
,
considering
the
quantity
,
it
is
n't
too
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
at
his
wit
's
end
,
soon
had
recourse
to
the
eternal
Lheureux
,
*NL*
who
swore
he
would
arrange
matters
if
the
doctor
would
sign
him
two
*NL*
bills
,
one
of
which
was
for
seven
hundred
francs
,
payable
in
three
*NL*
months
.
In
order
to
arrange
for
this
he
wrote
his
mother
a
pathetic
*NL*
letter
.
Instead
of
sending
a
reply
she
came
herself
;
and
when
Emma
*NL*
wanted
to
know
whether
he
had
got
anything
out
of
her
,
``
Yes
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
;
``
but
she
wants
to
see
the
account
.
''
The
next
morning
at
*NL*
daybreak
Emma
ran
to
Lheureux
to
beg
him
to
make
out
another
account
for
*NL*
not
more
than
a
thousand
francs
,
for
to
show
the
one
for
four
thousand
*NL*
it
would
be
necessary
to
say
that
she
had
paid
two-thirds
,
and
confess
,
*NL*
consequently
,
the
sale
of
the
estate
--
a
negotiation
admirably
carried
*NL*
out
by
the
shopkeeper
,
and
which
,
in
fact
,
was
only
actually
known
later
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
the
low
price
of
each
article
,
Madame
Bovary
senior
,
of
course
,
*NL*
thought
the
expenditure
extravagant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
you
do
without
a
carpet
?
Why
have
recovered
the
arm-chairs
?
In
*NL*
my
time
there
was
a
single
arm-chair
in
a
house
,
for
elderly
persons
--
at
*NL*
any
rate
it
was
so
at
my
mother
's
,
who
was
a
good
woman
,
I
can
tell
you
.
*NL*
Everybody
ca
n't
be
rich
!
No
fortune
can
hold
out
against
waste
!
I
should
*NL*
be
ashamed
to
coddle
myself
as
you
do
!
And
yet
I
am
old
.
I
need
looking
*NL*
after
.
And
there
!
there
!
fitting
up
gowns
!
fallals
!
What
!
silk
for
*NL*
lining
at
two
francs
,
when
you
can
get
jaconet
for
ten
sous
,
or
even
for
*NL*
eight
,
that
would
do
well
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
lying
on
a
lounge
,
replied
as
quietly
as
possible
--
``
Ah
!
Madame
,
*NL*
enough
!
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
went
on
lecturing
her
,
predicting
they
would
end
in
the
*NL*
workhouse
.
But
it
was
Bovary
's
fault
.
Luckily
he
had
promised
to
destroy
*NL*
that
power
of
attorney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
he
swore
he
would
,
''
went
on
the
good
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
opened
the
window
,
called
Charles
,
and
the
poor
fellow
was
obliged
*NL*
to
confess
the
promise
torn
from
him
by
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
disappeared
,
then
came
back
quickly
,
and
majestically
handed
her
a
*NL*
thick
piece
of
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
the
old
woman
.
And
she
threw
the
power
of
attorney
*NL*
into
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
began
to
laugh
,
a
strident
,
piercing
,
continuous
laugh
;
she
had
an
*NL*
attack
of
hysterics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
cried
Charles
.
``
Ah
!
you
really
are
wrong
!
You
come
here
*NL*
and
make
scenes
with
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
declared
it
was
``
all
put
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Charles
,
rebelling
for
the
first
time
,
took
his
wife
's
part
,
so
that
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
,
senior
,
said
she
would
leave
.
She
went
the
very
next
day
,
*NL*
and
on
the
threshold
,
as
he
was
trying
to
detain
her
,
she
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
You
love
her
better
than
me
,
and
you
are
right
.
It
is
natural
.
*NL*
For
the
rest
,
so
much
the
worse
!
You
will
see
.
Good
day
--
for
I
am
not
*NL*
likely
to
come
soon
again
,
as
you
say
,
to
make
scenes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
nevertheless
was
very
crestfallen
before
Emma
,
who
did
not
hide
*NL*
the
resentment
she
still
felt
at
his
want
of
confidence
,
and
it
needed
*NL*
many
prayers
before
she
would
consent
to
have
another
power
of
attorney
.
*NL*
He
even
accompanied
her
to
Monsieur
Guillaumin
to
have
a
second
one
,
*NL*
just
like
the
other
,
drawn
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
the
notary
;
``
a
man
of
science
ca
n't
be
worried
with
*NL*
the
practical
details
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Charles
felt
relieved
by
this
comfortable
reflection
,
which
gave
his
*NL*
weakness
the
flattering
appearance
of
higher
pre-occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
an
outburst
the
next
Thursday
at
the
hotel
in
their
room
with
*NL*
Leon
!
She
laughed
,
cried
,
sang
,
sent
for
sherbets
,
wanted
to
smoke
*NL*
cigarettes
,
seemed
to
him
wild
and
extravagant
,
but
adorable
,
superb
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
what
recreation
of
her
whole
being
drove
her
more
and
*NL*
more
to
plunge
into
the
pleasures
of
life
.
She
was
becoming
irritable
,
*NL*
greedy
,
voluptuous
;
and
she
walked
about
the
streets
with
him
carrying
*NL*
her
head
high
,
without
fear
,
so
she
said
,
of
compromising
herself
.
*NL*
At
times
,
however
,
Emma
shuddered
at
the
sudden
thought
of
meeting
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
,
although
they
were
separated
*NL*
forever
,
she
was
not
completely
free
from
her
subjugation
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
she
did
not
return
to
Yonville
at
all
.
Charles
lost
his
head
*NL*
with
anxiety
,
and
little
Berthe
would
not
go
to
bed
without
her
mamma
,
*NL*
and
sobbed
enough
to
break
her
heart
.
Justin
had
gone
out
searching
the
*NL*
road
at
random
.
Monsieur
Homais
even
had
left
his
pharmacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
at
eleven
o'clock
,
able
to
bear
it
no
longer
,
Charles
*NL*
harnessed
his
chaise
,
jumped
in
,
whipped
up
his
horse
,
and
reached
the
*NL*
``
Croix-Rouge
''
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
No
one
there
!
He
thought
*NL*
that
the
clerk
had
perhaps
seen
her
;
but
where
did
he
live
?
Happily
,
*NL*
Charles
remembered
his
employer
's
address
,
and
rushed
off
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
was
breaking
,
and
he
could
distinguish
the
escutcheons
over
the
*NL*
door
,
and
knocked
.
Someone
,
without
opening
the
door
,
shouted
out
the
*NL*
required
information
,
adding
a
few
insults
to
those
who
disturb
people
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
inhabited
by
the
clerk
had
neither
bell
,
knocker
,
nor
porter
.
*NL*
Charles
knocked
loudly
at
the
shutters
with
his
hands
.
A
policeman
*NL*
happened
to
pass
by
.
Then
he
was
frightened
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
mad
,
''
he
said
;
``
no
doubt
they
kept
her
to
dinner
at
Monsieur
*NL*
Lormeaux
'
.
''
But
the
Lormeaux
no
longer
lived
at
Rouen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
probably
stayed
to
look
after
Madame
Dubreuil
.
Why
,
Madame
Dubreuil
*NL*
has
been
dead
these
ten
months
!
Where
can
she
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
occurred
to
him
.
At
a
cafe
he
asked
for
a
Directory
,
and
*NL*
hurriedly
looked
for
the
name
of
Mademoiselle
Lempereur
,
who
lived
at
*NL*
No.
74
Rue
de
la
Renelle-des-Maroquiniers
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
turning
into
the
street
,
Emma
herself
appeared
at
the
other
*NL*
end
of
it
.
He
threw
himself
upon
her
rather
than
embraced
her
,
crying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kept
you
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
Where
?
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
and
answered
,
``
At
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Lempereur
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
of
it
!
I
was
going
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
n't
worth
while
,
''
said
Emma
.
``
She
went
out
just
now
;
but
for
*NL*
the
future
do
n't
worry
.
I
do
not
feel
free
,
you
see
,
if
I
know
that
the
*NL*
least
delay
upsets
you
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
sort
of
permission
that
she
gave
herself
,
so
as
to
get
*NL*
perfect
freedom
in
her
escapades
.
And
she
profited
by
it
freely
,
fully
.
*NL*
When
she
was
seized
with
the
desire
to
see
Leon
,
she
set
out
upon
any
*NL*
pretext
;
and
as
he
was
not
expecting
her
on
that
day
,
she
went
to
fetch
*NL*
him
at
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
delight
at
first
,
but
soon
he
no
longer
concealed
the
*NL*
truth
,
which
was
,
that
his
master
complained
very
much
about
these
*NL*
interruptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
come
along
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
slipped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
him
to
dress
all
in
black
,
and
grow
a
pointed
beard
,
to
*NL*
look
like
the
portraits
of
Louis
XIII
.
She
wanted
to
see
his
lodgings
;
*NL*
thought
them
poor
.
He
blushed
at
them
,
but
she
did
not
notice
this
,
then
*NL*
advised
him
to
buy
some
curtains
like
hers
,
and
as
he
objected
to
the
*NL*
expense
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
ah
!
you
care
for
your
money
,
''
she
said
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
time
Leon
had
to
tell
her
everything
that
he
had
done
since
their
*NL*
last
meeting
.
She
asked
him
for
some
verses
--
some
verses
``
for
herself
,
''
*NL*
a
``
love
poem
''
in
honour
of
her
.
But
he
never
succeeded
in
getting
a
*NL*
rhyme
for
the
second
verse
;
and
at
last
ended
by
copying
a
sonnet
in
*NL*
a
``
Keepsake
.
''
This
was
less
from
vanity
than
from
the
one
desire
of
*NL*
pleasing
her
.
He
did
not
question
her
ideas
;
he
accepted
all
her
tastes
;
*NL*
he
was
rather
becoming
her
mistress
than
she
his
.
She
had
tender
words
*NL*
and
kisses
that
thrilled
his
soul
.
Where
could
she
have
learnt
this
*NL*
corruption
almost
incorporeal
in
the
strength
of
its

Chapter
Six

*NL*
During
the
journeys
he
made
to
see
her
,
Leon
had
often
dined
at
the
*NL*
chemist
's
,
and
he
felt
obliged
from
politeness
to
invite
him
in
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
!
''
Monsieur
Homais
replied
;
``
besides
,
I
must
invigorate
*NL*
my
mind
,
for
I
am
getting
rusty
here
.
We
'll
go
to
the
theatre
,
to
the
*NL*
restaurant
;
we
'll
make
a
night
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
!
''
tenderly
murmured
Madame
Homais
,
alarmed
at
the
vague
*NL*
perils
he
was
preparing
to
brave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
Do
you
think
I
'm
not
sufficiently
ruining
my
health
living
*NL*
here
amid
the
continual
emanations
of
the
pharmacy
?
But
there
!
that
is
*NL*
the
way
with
women
!
They
are
jealous
of
science
,
and
then
are
opposed
to
*NL*
our
taking
the
most
legitimate
distractions
.
No
matter
!
Count
upon
*NL*
me
.
One
of
these
days
I
shall
turn
up
at
Rouen
,
and
we
'll
go
the
pace
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
would
formerly
have
taken
good
care
not
to
use
such
an
*NL*
expression
,
but
he
was
cultivating
a
gay
Parisian
style
,
which
he
*NL*
thought
in
the
best
taste
;
and
,
like
his
neighbour
,
Madame
Bovary
,
he
*NL*
questioned
the
clerk
curiously
about
the
customs
of
the
capital
;
he
*NL*
even
talked
slang
to
dazzle
the
bourgeois
,
saying
bender
,
crummy
,
dandy
,
*NL*
macaroni
,
the
cheese
,
cut
my
stick
and
``
I
'll
hook
it
,
''
for
``
I
am
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
one
Thursday
Emma
was
surprised
to
meet
Monsieur
Homais
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
of
the
``
Lion
d'Or
,
''
wearing
a
traveller
's
costume
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
wrapped
in
an
old
cloak
which
no
one
knew
he
had
,
while
he
carried
*NL*
a
valise
in
one
hand
and
the
foot-warmer
of
his
establishment
in
the
*NL*
other
.
He
had
confided
his
intentions
to
no
one
,
for
fear
of
causing
the
*NL*
public
anxiety
by
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
seeing
again
the
place
where
his
youth
had
been
spent
no
*NL*
doubt
excited
him
,
for
during
the
whole
journey
he
never
ceased
talking
,
*NL*
and
as
soon
as
he
had
arrived
,
he
jumped
quickly
out
of
the
diligence
*NL*
to
go
in
search
of
Leon
.
In
vain
the
clerk
tried
to
get
rid
of
him
.
*NL*
Monsieur
Homais
dragged
him
off
to
the
large
Cafe
de
la
Normandie
,
*NL*
which
he
entered
majestically
,
not
raising
his
hat
,
thinking
it
very
*NL*
provincial
to
uncover
in
any
public
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
waited
for
Leon
three
quarters
of
an
hour
.
At
last
she
ran
to
*NL*
his
office
;
and
,
lost
in
all
sorts
of
conjectures
,
accusing
him
of
*NL*
indifference
,
and
reproaching
herself
for
her
weakness
,
she
spent
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
her
face
pressed
against
the
window-panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
they
were
still
at
a
table
opposite
each
other
.
The
large
*NL*
room
was
emptying
;
the
stove-pipe
,
in
the
shape
of
a
palm-tree
,
spread
*NL*
its
gilt
leaves
over
the
white
ceiling
,
and
near
them
,
outside
the
*NL*
window
,
in
the
bright
sunshine
,
a
little
fountain
gurgled
in
a
white
*NL*
basin
,
where
;
in
the
midst
of
watercress
and
asparagus
,
three
torpid
*NL*
lobsters
stretched
across
to
some
quails
that
lay
heaped
up
in
a
pile
on
*NL*
their
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
was
enjoying
himself
.
Although
he
was
even
more
intoxicated
with
*NL*
the
luxury
than
the
rich
fare
,
the
Pommard
wine
all
the
same
rather
*NL*
excited
his
faculties
;
and
when
the
omelette
au
rhum
*
appeared
,
he
began
*NL*
propounding
immoral
theories
about
women
.
What
seduced
him
above
all
*NL*
else
was
chic
.
He
admired
an
elegant
toilette
in
a
well-furnished
*NL*
apartment
,
and
as
to
bodily
qualities
,
he
did
n't
dislike
a
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
In
rum
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
watched
the
clock
in
despair
.
The
druggist
went
on
drinking
,
*NL*
eating
,
and
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
very
lonely
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
``
here
at
Rouen
.
To
be
sure
*NL*
your
lady-love
does
n't
live
far
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
other
blushed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
be
frank
.
Can
you
deny
that
at
Yonville
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
stammered
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Madame
Bovary
's
,
you
're
not
making
love
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
joking
;
but
vanity
getting
the
better
of
all
prudence
,
Leon
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
himself
protested
.
Besides
,
he
only
liked
dark
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
approve
of
that
,
''
said
the
chemist
;
``
they
have
more
passion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
whispering
into
his
friend
's
ear
,
he
pointed
out
the
symptoms
by
*NL*
which
one
could
find
out
if
a
woman
had
passion
.
He
even
launched
into
*NL*
an
ethnographic
digression
:
the
German
was
vapourish
,
the
French
woman
*NL*
licentious
,
the
Italian
passionate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
negresses
?
''
asked
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
an
artistic
taste
!
''
said
Homais
.
``
Waiter
!
two
cups
of
coffee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
going
?
''
at
last
asked
Leon
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ja
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
leaving
he
wanted
to
see
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
*NL*
and
made
him
a
few
compliments
.
Then
the
young
man
,
to
be
alone
,
alleged
*NL*
he
had
some
business
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
will
escort
you
,
''
said
Homais
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
the
while
he
was
walking
through
the
streets
with
him
he
talked
*NL*
of
his
wife
,
his
children
;
of
their
future
,
and
of
his
business
;
told
*NL*
him
in
what
a
decayed
condition
it
had
formerly
been
,
and
to
what
a
*NL*
degree
of
perfection
he
had
raised
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
in
front
of
the
Hotel
de
Boulogne
,
Leon
left
him
abruptly
,
ran
*NL*
up
the
stairs
,
and
found
his
mistress
in
great
excitement
.
At
mention
of
*NL*
the
chemist
she
flew
into
a
passion
.
He
,
however
,
piled
up
good
reasons
;
*NL*
it
was
n't
his
fault
;
did
n't
she
know
Homais
--
did
she
believe
that
he
*NL*
would
prefer
his
company
?
But
she
turned
away
;
he
drew
her
back
,
and
,
*NL*
sinking
on
his
knees
,
clasped
her
waist
with
his
arms
in
a
languorous
*NL*
pose
,
full
of
concupiscence
and
supplication
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
standing
up
,
her
large
flashing
eyes
looked
at
him
seriously
,
*NL*
almost
terribly
.
Then
tears
obscured
them
,
her
red
eyelids
were
lowered
,
*NL*
she
gave
him
her
hands
,
and
Leon
was
pressing
them
to
his
lips
when
a
*NL*
servant
appeared
to
tell
the
gentleman
that
he
was
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
come
back
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
trick
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
when
he
saw
Leon
.
``
I
wanted
to
*NL*
interrupt
this
visit
,
that
seemed
to
me
to
annoy
you
.
Let
's
go
and
have
*NL*
a
glass
of
garus
at
Bridoux
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
vowed
that
he
must
get
back
to
his
office
.
Then
the
druggist
joked
*NL*
him
about
quill-drivers
and
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
Cujas
and
Barthole
alone
a
bit
.
Who
the
devil
prevents
you
?
Be
a
*NL*
man
!
Let
's
go
to
Bridoux
'
.
You
'll
see
his
dog
.
It
's
very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
the
clerk
still
insisted
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
with
you
.
I
'll
read
a
paper
while
I
wait
for
you
,
or
turn
over
*NL*
the
leaves
of
a
`
Code
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leon
,
bewildered
by
Emma
's
anger
,
Monsieur
Homais
'
chatter
,
and
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
by
the
heaviness
of
the
luncheon
,
was
undecided
,
and
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
fascinated
by
the
chemist
,
who
kept
repeating
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
to
Bridoux
'
.
It
's
just
by
here
,
in
the
Rue
Malpalu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
through
cowardice
,
through
stupidity
,
through
that
indefinable
*NL*
feeling
that
drags
us
into
the
most
distasteful
acts
,
he
allowed
*NL*
himself
to
be
led
off
to
Bridoux
'
,
whom
they
found
in
his
small
yard
,
*NL*
superintending
three
workmen
,
who
panted
as
they
turned
the
large
*NL*
wheel
of
a
machine
for
making
seltzer-water
.
Homais
gave
them
some
good
*NL*
advice
.
He
embraced
Bridoux
;
they
took
some
garus
.
Twenty
times
Leon
*NL*
tried
to
escape
,
but
the
other
seized
him
by
the
arm
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
!
I
'm
coming
!
We
'll
go
to
the
`
Fanal
de
Rouen
'
to
see
the
*NL*
fellows
there
.
I
'll
introduce
you
to
Thornassin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
managed
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
rushed
straight
to
the
hotel
.
*NL*
Emma
was
no
longer
there
.
She
had
just
gone
in
a
fit
of
anger
.
She
*NL*
detested
him
now
.
This
failing
to
keep
their
rendezvous
seemed
to
her
an
*NL*
insult
,
and
she
tried
to
rake
up
other
reasons
to
separate
herself
from
*NL*
him
.
He
was
incapable
of
heroism
,
weak
,
banal
,
more
spiritless
than
a
*NL*
woman
,
avaricious
too
,
and
cowardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
growing
calmer
,
she
at
length
discovered
that
she
had
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
calumniated
him
.
But
the
disparaging
of
those
we
love
always
alienates
*NL*
us
from
them
to
some
extent
.
We
must
not
touch
our
idols
;
the
gilt
*NL*
sticks
to
our
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gradually
came
to
talking
more
frequently
of
matters
outside
their
*NL*
love
,
and
in
the
letters
that
Emma
wrote
him
she
spoke
of
flowers
,
*NL*
verses
,
the
moon
and
the
stars
,
naive
resources
of
a
waning
passion
*NL*
striving
to
keep
itself
alive
by
all
external
aids
.
She
was
constantly
*NL*
promising
herself
a
profound
felicity
on
her
next
journey
.
Then
*NL*
she
confessed
to
herself
that
she
felt
nothing
extraordinary
.
This
*NL*
disappointment
quickly
gave
way
to
a
new
hope
,
and
Emma
returned
to
him
*NL*
more
inflamed
,
more
eager
than
ever
.
She
undressed
brutally
,
tearing
off
*NL*
the
thin
laces
of
her
corset
that
nestled
around
her
hips
like
a
gliding
*NL*
snake
.
She
went
on
tiptoe
,
barefooted
,
to
see
once
more
that
the
*NL*
door
was
closed
,
then
,
pale
,
serious
,
and
,
without
speaking
,
with
one
*NL*
movement
,
she
threw
herself
upon
his
breast
with
a
long
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
there
was
upon
that
brow
covered
with
cold
drops
,
on
those
quivering
*NL*
lips
,
in
those
wild
eyes
,
in
the
strain
of
those
arms
,
something
vague
*NL*
and
dreary
that
seemed
to
Leon
to
glide
between
them
subtly
as
if
to
*NL*
separate
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
dare
to
question
her
;
but
,
seeing
her
so
skilled
,
she
must
*NL*
have
passed
,
he
thought
,
through
every
experience
of
suffering
and
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
What
had
once
charmed
now
frightened
him
a
little
.
Besides
,
he
*NL*
rebelled
against
his
absorption
,
daily
more
marked
,
by
her
personality
.
*NL*
He
begrudged
Emma
this
constant
victory
.
He
even
strove
not
to
love
her
;
*NL*
then
,
when
he
heard
the
creaking
of
her
boots
,
he
turned
coward
,
like
*NL*
drunkards
at
the
sight
of
strong
drinks
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
fail
,
in
truth
,
to
lavish
all
sorts
of
attentions
upon
him
,
*NL*
from
the
delicacies
of
food
to
the
coquettries
of
dress
and
languishing
*NL*
looks
.
She
brought
roses
to
her
breast
from
Yonville
,
which
she
threw
*NL*
into
his
face
;
was
anxious
about
his
health
,
gave
him
advice
as
to
his
*NL*
conduct
;
and
,
in
order
the
more
surely
to
keep
her
hold
on
him
,
hoping
*NL*
perhaps
that
heaven
would
take
her
part
,
she
tied
a
medal
of
the
*NL*
Virgin
round
his
neck
.
She
inquired
like
a
virtuous
mother
about
his
*NL*
companions
.
She
said
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
see
them
;
do
n't
go
out
;
think
only
of
ourselves
;
love
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
liked
to
be
able
to
watch
over
his
life
;
and
the
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
her
of
having
him
followed
in
the
streets
.
Near
the
hotel
*NL*
there
was
always
a
kind
of
loafer
who
accosted
travellers
,
and
who
would
*NL*
not
refuse
.
But
her
pride
revolted
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
so
much
the
worse
.
Let
him
deceive
me
!
What
does
it
matter
to
me
?
*NL*
As
If
I
cared
for
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
they
had
parted
early
and
she
was
returning
alone
along
*NL*
the
boulevard
,
she
saw
the
walls
of
her
convent
;
then
she
sat
down
on
a
*NL*
form
in
the
shade
of
the
elm-trees
.
How
calm
that
time
had
been
!
How
she
*NL*
longed
for
the
ineffable
sentiments
of
love
that
she
had
tried
to
figure
*NL*
to
herself
out
of
books
!
The
first
month
of
her
marriage
,
her
rides
in
*NL*
the
wood
,
the
viscount
that
waltzed
,
and
Lagardy
singing
,
all
repassed
*NL*
before
her
eyes
.
And
Leon
suddenly
appeared
to
her
as
far
off
as
the
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
love
him
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
matter
!
She
was
not
happy
--
she
never
had
been
.
Whence
came
this
*NL*
insufficiency
in
life
--
this
instantaneous
turning
to
decay
of
everything
*NL*
on
which
she
leant
?
But
if
there
were
somewhere
a
being
strong
and
*NL*
beautiful
,
a
valiant
nature
,
full
at
once
of
exaltation
and
refinement
,
*NL*
a
poet
's
heart
in
an
angel
's
form
,
a
lyre
with
sounding
chords
ringing
*NL*
out
elegiac
epithalamia
to
heaven
,
why
,
perchance
,
should
she
not
find
*NL*
him
?
Ah
!
how
impossible
!
Besides
,
nothing
was
worth
the
trouble
of
*NL*
seeking
it
;
everything
was
a
lie
.
Every
smile
hid
a
yawn
of
boredom
,
*NL*
every
joy
a
curse
,
all
pleasure
satiety
,
and
the
sweetest
kisses
left
*NL*
upon
your
lips
only
the
unattainable
desire
for
a
greater
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
metallic
clang
droned
through
the
air
,
and
four
strokes
were
heard
*NL*
from
the
convent-clock
.
Four
o'clock
!
And
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
*NL*
been
there
on
that
form
an
eternity
.
But
an
infinity
of
passions
may
be
*NL*
contained
in
a
minute
,
like
a
crowd
in
a
small
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
lived
all
absorbed
in
hers
,
and
troubled
no
more
about
money
*NL*
matters
than
an
archduchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
however
,
a
wretched-looking
man
,
rubicund
and
bald
,
came
to
her
*NL*
house
,
saying
he
had
been
sent
by
Monsieur
Vincart
of
Rouen
.
He
took
out
*NL*
the
pins
that
held
together
the
side-pockets
of
his
long
green
overcoat
,
*NL*
stuck
them
into
his
sleeve
,
and
politely
handed
her
a
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bill
for
seven
hundred
francs
,
signed
by
her
,
and
which
*NL*
Lheureux
,
in
spite
of
all
his
professions
,
had
paid
away
to
Vincart
.
She
*NL*
sent
her
servant
for
him
.
He
could
not
come
.
Then
the
stranger
,
who
*NL*
had
remained
standing
,
casting
right
and
left
curious
glances
,
that
his
*NL*
thick
,
fair
eyebrows
hid
,
asked
with
a
naive
air
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
answer
am
I
to
take
Monsieur
Vincart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Emma
,
``
tell
him
that
I
have
n't
it
.
I
will
send
next
week
;
he
*NL*
must
wait
;
yes
,
till
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
fellow
went
without
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
day
at
twelve
o'clock
she
received
a
summons
,
and
the
sight
*NL*
of
the
stamped
paper
,
on
which
appeared
several
times
in
large
letters
,
*NL*
``
Maitre
Hareng
,
bailiff
at
Buchy
,
''
so
frightened
her
that
she
rushed
in
*NL*
hot
haste
to
the
linendraper
's
.
She
found
him
in
his
shop
,
doing
up
a
*NL*
parcel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
obedient
!
''
he
said
;
``
I
am
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lheureux
,
all
the
same
,
went
on
with
his
work
,
helped
by
a
young
*NL*
girl
of
about
thirteen
,
somewhat
hunch-backed
,
who
was
at
once
his
clerk
*NL*
and
his
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
his
clogs
clattering
on
the
shop-boards
,
he
went
up
in
front
*NL*
of
Madame
Bovary
to
the
first
door
,
and
introduced
her
into
a
narrow
*NL*
closet
,
where
,
in
a
large
bureau
in
sapon-wood
,
lay
some
ledgers
,
*NL*
protected
by
a
horizontal
padlocked
iron
bar
.
Against
the
wall
,
under
*NL*
some
remnants
of
calico
,
one
glimpsed
a
safe
,
but
of
such
dimensions
*NL*
that
it
must
contain
something
besides
bills
and
money
.
Monsieur
*NL*
Lheureux
,
in
fact
,
went
in
for
pawnbroking
,
and
it
was
there
that
he
had
*NL*
put
Madame
Bovary
's
gold
chain
,
together
with
the
earrings
of
poor
old
*NL*
Tellier
,
who
,
at
last
forced
to
sell
out
,
had
bought
a
meagre
store
*NL*
of
grocery
at
Quincampoix
,
where
he
was
dying
of
catarrh
amongst
his
*NL*
candles
,
that
were
less
yellow
than
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lheureux
sat
down
in
a
large
cane
arm-chair
,
saying
:
``
What
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
showed
him
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
how
can
I
help
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
grew
angry
,
reminding
him
of
the
promise
he
had
given
not
to
*NL*
pay
away
her
bills
.
He
acknowledged
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
was
pressed
myself
;
the
knife
was
at
my
own
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
happen
now
?
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
very
simple
;
a
judgment
and
then
a
distraint
--
that
's
about
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
kept
down
a
desire
to
strike
him
,
and
asked
gently
if
there
was
no
*NL*
way
of
quieting
Monsieur
Vincart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
!
Quiet
Vincart
!
You
do
n't
know
him
;
he
's
more
ferocious
than
*NL*
an
Arab
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
Monsieur
Lheureux
must
interfere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
listen
.
It
seems
to
me
so
far
I
've
been
very
good
to
you
.
''
And
*NL*
opening
one
of
his
ledgers
,
``
See
,
''
he
said
.
Then
running
up
the
page
*NL*
with
his
finger
,
``
Let
's
see
!
let
's
see
!
August
3d
,
two
hundred
francs
;
*NL*
June
17th
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
;
March
23d
,
forty-six
.
In
April
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
,
as
if
afraid
of
making
some
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
speak
of
the
bills
signed
by
Monsieur
Bovary
,
one
for
seven
*NL*
hundred
francs
,
and
another
for
three
hundred
.
As
to
your
little
*NL*
installments
,
with
the
interest
,
why
,
there
's
no
end
to
'em
;
one
gets
*NL*
quite
muddled
over
'em
.
I
'll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wept
;
she
even
called
him
``
her
good
Monsieur
Lheureux
.
''
But
he
*NL*
always
fell
back
upon
``
that
rascal
Vincart
.
''
Besides
,
he
had
n't
a
brass
*NL*
farthing
;
no
one
was
paying
him
now-a-days
;
they
were
eating
his
coat
*NL*
off
his
back
;
a
poor
shopkeeper
like
him
could
n't
advance
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
silent
,
and
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
who
was
biting
the
feathers
of
a
*NL*
quill
,
no
doubt
became
uneasy
at
her
silence
,
for
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
one
of
these
days
I
have
something
coming
in
,
I
might
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
she
,
``
as
soon
as
the
balance
of
Barneville
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
hearing
that
Langlois
had
not
yet
paid
he
seemed
much
surprised
.
*NL*
Then
in
a
honied
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
agree
,
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
to
anything
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
he
closed
his
eyes
to
reflect
,
wrote
down
a
few
figures
,
and
*NL*
declaring
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
him
,
that
the
affair
was
shady
,
*NL*
and
that
he
was
being
bled
,
he
wrote
out
four
bills
for
two
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
francs
each
,
to
fall
due
month
by
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Provided
that
Vincart
will
listen
to
me
!
However
,
it
's
settled
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
play
the
fool
;
I
'm
straight
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
he
carelessly
showed
her
several
new
goods
,
not
one
of
which
,
*NL*
however
,
was
in
his
opinion
worthy
of
madame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
think
that
there
's
a
dress
at
threepence-halfpenny
a
yard
,
and
*NL*
warranted
fast
colours
!
And
yet
they
actually
swallow
it
!
Of
course
you
*NL*
understand
one
does
n't
tell
them
what
it
really
is
!
''
He
hoped
by
this
*NL*
confession
of
dishonesty
to
others
to
quite
convince
her
of
his
probity
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
called
her
back
to
show
her
three
yards
of
guipure
that
he
had
*NL*
lately
picked
up
``
at
a
sale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
lovely
?
''
said
Lheureux
.
``
It
is
very
much
used
now
for
the
*NL*
backs
of
arm-chairs
.
It
's
quite
the
rage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
more
ready
than
a
juggler
,
he
wrapped
up
the
guipure
in
some
blue
*NL*
paper
and
put
it
in
Emma
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
at
least
let
me
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
another
time
,
''
he
replied
,
turning
on
his
heel
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
she
urged
Bovary
to
write
to
his
mother
,
to
ask
her
*NL*
to
send
as
quickly
as
possible
the
whole
of
the
balance
due
from
the
*NL*
father
's
estate
.
The
mother-in-law
replied
that
she
had
nothing
more
,
*NL*
the
winding
up
was
over
,
and
there
was
due
to
them
besides
Barneville
an
*NL*
income
of
six
hundred
francs
,
that
she
would
pay
them
punctually
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Madame
Bovary
sent
in
accounts
to
two
or
three
patients
,
and
she
*NL*
made
large
use
of
this
method
,
which
was
very
successful
.
She
was
always
*NL*
careful
to
add
a
postscript
:
``
Do
not
mention
this
to
my
husband
;
you
*NL*
know
how
proud
he
is
.
Excuse
me
.
Yours
obediently
.
''
There
were
some
*NL*
complaints
;
she
intercepted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
money
she
began
selling
her
old
gloves
,
her
old
hats
,
the
old
*NL*
odds
and
ends
,
and
she
bargained
rapaciously
,
her
peasant
blood
standing
*NL*
her
in
good
stead
.
Then
on
her
journey
to
town
she
picked
up
nick-nacks
*NL*
secondhand
,
that
,
in
default
of
anyone
else
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
would
*NL*
certainly
take
off
her
hands
.
She
bought
ostrich
feathers
,
Chinese
*NL*
porcelain
,
and
trunks
;
she
borrowed
from
Felicite
,
from
Madame
*NL*
Lefrancois
,
from
the
landlady
at
the
Croix-Rouge
,
from
everybody
,
no
*NL*
matter
where
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
money
she
at
last
received
from
Barneville
she
paid
two
bills
;
*NL*
the
other
fifteen
hundred
francs
fell
due
.
She
renewed
the
bills
,
and
*NL*
thus
it
was
continually
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
it
is
true
,
she
tried
to
make
a
calculation
,
but
she
*NL*
discovered
things
so
exorbitant
that
she
could
not
believe
them
*NL*
possible
.
Then
she
recommenced
,
soon
got
confused
,
gave
it
all
up
,
and
*NL*
thought
no
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
very
dreary
now
.
Tradesmen
were
seen
leaving
it
with
angry
*NL*
faces
.
Handkerchiefs
were
lying
about
on
the
stoves
,
and
little
Berthe
,
*NL*
to
the
great
scandal
of
Madame
Homais
,
wore
stockings
with
holes
in
*NL*
them
.
If
Charles
timidly
ventured
a
remark
,
she
answered
roughly
that
it
*NL*
was
n't
her
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
meaning
of
all
these
fits
of
temper
?
He
explained
*NL*
everything
through
her
old
nervous
illness
,
and
reproaching
himself
with
*NL*
having
taken
her
infirmities
for
faults
,
accused
himself
of
egotism
,
and
*NL*
longed
to
go
and
take
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
!
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
I
should
worry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
he
walked
about
alone
in
the
garden
;
he
took
little
Berthe
*NL*
on
his
knees
,
and
unfolding
his
medical
journal
,
tried
to
teach
her
*NL*
to
read
.
But
the
child
,
who
never
had
any
lessons
,
soon
looked
up
with
*NL*
large
,
sad
eyes
and
began
to
cry
.
Then
he
comforted
her
;
went
to
fetch
*NL*
water
in
her
can
to
make
rivers
on
the
sand
path
,
or
broke
off
branches
*NL*
from
the
privet
hedges
to
plant
trees
in
the
beds
.
This
did
not
spoil
*NL*
the
garden
much
,
all
choked
now
with
long
weeds
.
They
owed
Lestiboudois
*NL*
for
so
many
days
.
Then
the
child
grew
cold
and
asked
for
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
the
servant
,
''
said
Charles
.
``
You
know
,
dearie
,
that
mamma
does
not
*NL*
like
to
be
disturbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Autumn
was
setting
in
,
and
the
leaves
were
already
falling
,
as
they
did
*NL*
two
years
ago
when
she
was
ill
.
Where
would
it
all
end
?
And
he
walked
up
*NL*
and
down
,
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
was
in
her
room
,
which
no
one
entered
.
She
stayed
there
all
*NL*
day
long
,
torpid
,
half
dressed
,
and
from
time
to
time
burning
Turkish
*NL*
pastilles
which
she
had
bought
at
Rouen
in
an
Algerian
's
shop
.
In
order
*NL*
not
to
have
at
night
this
sleeping
man
stretched
at
her
side
,
by
dint
of
*NL*
manoeuvring
,
she
at
last
succeeded
in
banishing
him
to
the
second
floor
,
*NL*
while
she
read
till
morning
extravagant
books
,
full
of
pictures
of
*NL*
orgies
and
thrilling
situations
.
Often
,
seized
with
fear
,
she
cried
out
,
*NL*
and
Charles
hurried
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
away
!
''
she
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
at
other
times
,
consumed
more
ardently
than
ever
by
that
inner
flame
*NL*
to
which
adultery
added
fuel
,
panting
,
tremulous
,
all
desire
,
she
threw
*NL*
open
her
window
,
breathed
in
the
cold
air
,
shook
loose
in
the
wind
her
*NL*
masses
of
hair
,
too
heavy
,
and
,
gazing
upon
the
stars
,
longed
for
some
*NL*
princely
love
.
She
thought
of
him
,
of
Leon
.
She
would
then
have
given
*NL*
anything
for
a
single
one
of
those
meetings
that
surfeited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
her
gala
days
.
She
wanted
them
to
be
sumptuous
,
and
when
he
*NL*
alone
could
not
pay
the
expenses
,
she
made
up
the
deficit
liberally
,
*NL*
which
happened
pretty
well
every
time
.
He
tried
to
make
her
understand
*NL*
that
they
would
be
quite
as
comfortable
somewhere
else
,
in
a
smaller
*NL*
hotel
,
but
she
always
found
some
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
drew
six
small
silver-gilt
spoons
from
her
bag
-LRB-
they
were
*NL*
old
Roualt
's
wedding
present
-RRB-
,
begging
him
to
pawn
them
at
once
for
her
,
*NL*
and
Leon
obeyed
,
though
the
proceeding
annoyed
him
.
He
was
afraid
of
*NL*
compromising
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
on
,
reflection
,
he
began
to
think
his
mistress
's
ways
were
growing
*NL*
odd
,
and
that
they
were
perhaps
not
wrong
in
wishing
to
separate
him
*NL*
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
someone
had
sent
his
mother
a
long
anonymous
letter
to
warn
her
*NL*
that
he
was
``
ruining
himself
with
a
married
woman
,
''
and
the
good
lady
at
*NL*
once
conjuring
up
the
eternal
bugbear
of
families
,
the
vague
pernicious
*NL*
creature
,
the
siren
,
the
monster
,
who
dwells
fantastically
in
depths
of
*NL*
love
,
wrote
to
Lawyer
Dubocage
,
his
employer
,
who
behaved
perfectly
in
*NL*
the
affair
.
He
kept
him
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
trying
to
open
*NL*
his
eyes
,
to
warn
him
of
the
abyss
into
which
he
was
falling
.
Such
*NL*
an
intrigue
would
damage
him
later
on
,
when
he
set
up
for
himself
.
He
*NL*
implored
him
to
break
with
her
,
and
,
if
he
would
not
make
this
sacrifice
*NL*
in
his
own
interest
,
to
do
it
at
least
for
his
,
Dubocage
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Leon
swore
he
would
not
see
Emma
again
,
and
he
reproached
*NL*
himself
with
not
having
kept
his
word
,
considering
all
the
worry
and
*NL*
lectures
this
woman
might
still
draw
down
upon
him
,
without
reckoning
*NL*
the
jokes
made
by
his
companions
as
they
sat
round
the
stove
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
Besides
,
he
was
soon
to
be
head
clerk
;
it
was
time
to
settle
*NL*
down
.
So
he
gave
up
his
flute
,
exalted
sentiments
,
and
poetry
;
for
every
*NL*
bourgeois
in
the
flush
of
his
youth
,
were
it
but
for
a
day
,
a
moment
,
*NL*
has
believed
himself
capable
of
immense
passions
,
of
lofty
enterprises
.
*NL*
The
most
mediocre
libertine
has
dreamed
of
sultanas
;
every
notary
bears
*NL*
within
him
the
debris
of
a
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
bored
now
when
Emma
suddenly
began
to
sob
on
his
breast
,
and
his
*NL*
heart
,
like
the
people
who
can
only
stand
a
certain
amount
of
music
,
*NL*
dozed
to
the
sound
of
a
love
whose
delicacies
he
no
longer
noted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
one
another
too
well
for
any
of
those
surprises
of
possession
*NL*
that
increase
its
joys
a
hundred-fold
.
She
was
as
sick
of
him
as
he
*NL*
was
weary
of
her
.
Emma
found
again
in
adultery
all
the
platitudes
of
*NL*
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
to
get
rid
of
him
?
Then
,
though
she
might
feel
humiliated
at
*NL*
the
baseness
of
such
enjoyment
,
she
clung
to
it
from
habit
or
from
*NL*
corruption
,
and
each
day
she
hungered
after
them
the
more
,
exhausting
*NL*
all
felicity
in
wishing
for
too
much
of
it
.
She
accused
Leon
of
her
*NL*
baffled
hopes
,
as
if
he
had
betrayed
her
;
and
she
even
longed
for
some
*NL*
catastrophe
that
would
bring
about
their
separation
,
since
she
had
not
*NL*
the
courage
to
make
up
her
mind
to
it
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
none
the
less
went
on
writing
him
love
letters
,
in
virtue
of
the
*NL*
notion
that
a
woman
must
write
to
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whilst
she
wrote
it
was
another
man
she
saw
,
a
phantom
fashioned
out
*NL*
of
her
most
ardent
memories
,
of
her
finest
reading
,
her
strongest
*NL*
lusts
,
and
at
last
he
became
so
real
,
so
tangible
,
that
she
palpitated
*NL*
wondering
,
without
,
however
,
the
power
to
imagine
him
clearly
,
so
lost
*NL*
was
he
,
like
a
god
,
beneath
the
abundance
of
his
attributes
.
He
dwelt
in
*NL*
that
azure
land
where
silk
ladders
hang
from
balconies
under
the
breath
*NL*
of
flowers
,
in
the
light
of
the
moon
.
She
felt
him
near
her
;
he
was
*NL*
coming
,
and
would
carry
her
right
away
in
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
fell
back
exhausted
,
for
these
transports
of
vague
love
wearied
*NL*
her
more
than
great
debauchery
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
felt
constant
ache
all
over
her
.
Often
she
even
received
*NL*
summonses
,
stamped
paper
that
she
barely
looked
at
.
She
would
have
liked
*NL*
not
to
be
alive
,
or
to
be
always
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Mid-Lent
she
did
not
return
to
Yonville
,
but
in
the
evening
went
to
*NL*
a
masked
ball
.
She
wore
velvet
breeches
,
red
stockings
,
a
club
wig
,
and
*NL*
three-cornered
hat
cocked
on
one
side
.
She
danced
all
night
to
the
wild
*NL*
tones
of
the
trombones
;
people
gathered
round
her
,
and
in
the
morning
*NL*
she
found
herself
on
the
steps
of
the
theatre
together
with
five
or
six
*NL*
masks
,
debardeuses
*
and
sailors
,
Leon
's
comrades
,
who
were
talking
about
*NL*
having
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
People
dressed
as
longshoremen
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbouring
cafes
were
full
.
They
caught
sight
of
one
on
the
*NL*
harbour
,
a
very
indifferent
restaurant
,
whose
proprietor
showed
them
to
*NL*
a
little
room
on
the
fourth
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
were
whispering
in
a
corner
,
no
doubt
consorting
about
expenses
.
*NL*
There
were
a
clerk
,
two
medical
students
,
and
a
shopman
--
what
company
*NL*
for
her
!
As
to
the
women
,
Emma
soon
perceived
from
the
tone
of
their
*NL*
voices
that
they
must
almost
belong
to
the
lowest
class
.
Then
she
was
*NL*
frightened
,
pushed
back
her
chair
,
and
cast
down
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
began
to
eat
;
she
ate
nothing
.
Her
head
was
on
fire
,
her
eyes
*NL*
smarted
,
and
her
skin
was
ice-cold
.
In
her
head
she
seemed
to
feel
the
*NL*
floor
of
the
ball-room
rebounding
again
beneath
the
rhythmical
pulsation
*NL*
of
the
thousands
of
dancing
feet
.
And
now
the
smell
of
the
punch
,
the
*NL*
smoke
of
the
cigars
,
made
her
giddy
.
She
fainted
,
and
they
carried
her
*NL*
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
was
breaking
,
and
a
great
stain
of
purple
colour
broadened
out
*NL*
in
the
pale
horizon
over
the
St.
Catherine
hills
.
The
livid
river
was
*NL*
shivering
in
the
wind
;
there
was
no
one
on
the
bridges
;
the
street
lamps
*NL*
were
going
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
revived
,
and
began
thinking
of
Berthe
asleep
yonder
in
the
servant
's
*NL*
room
.
Then
a
cart
filled
with
long
strips
of
iron
passed
by
,
and
made
a
*NL*
deafening
metallic
vibration
against
the
walls
of
the
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slipped
away
suddenly
,
threw
off
her
costume
,
told
Leon
she
must
get
*NL*
back
,
and
at
last
was
alone
at
the
Hotel
de
Boulogne
.
Everything
,
even
*NL*
herself
,
was
now
unbearable
to
her
.
She
wished
that
,
taking
wing
like
a
*NL*
bird
,
she
could
fly
somewhere
,
far
away
to
regions
of
purity
,
and
there
*NL*
grow
young
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
,
crossed
the
Boulevard
,
the
Place
Cauchoise
,
and
the
*NL*
Faubourg
,
as
far
as
an
open
street
that
overlooked
some
gardens
.
She
*NL*
walked
rapidly
;
the
fresh
air
calming
her
;
and
,
little
by
little
,
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
crowd
,
the
masks
,
the
quadrilles
,
the
lights
,
the
supper
,
*NL*
those
women
,
all
disappeared
like
mists
fading
away
.
Then
,
reaching
the
*NL*
``
Croix-Rouge
,
''
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
in
her
little
room
on
the
*NL*
second
floor
,
where
there
were
pictures
of
the
``
Tour
de
Nesle
.
''
At
four
*NL*
o'clock
Hivert
awoke
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
home
,
Felicite
showed
her
behind
the
clock
a
grey
paper
.
*NL*
She
read
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
virtue
of
the
seizure
in
execution
of
a
judgment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
judgment
?
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
evening
before
another
paper
*NL*
had
been
brought
that
she
had
not
yet
seen
,
and
she
was
stunned
by
these
*NL*
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
order
of
the
king
,
law
,
and
justice
,
to
Madame
Bovary
.
''
Then
,
*NL*
skipping
several
lines
,
she
read
,
``
Within
twenty-four
hours
,
without
*NL*
fail
--
''
But
what
?
``
To
pay
the
sum
of
eight
thousand
francs
.
''
And
there
*NL*
was
even
at
the
bottom
,
``
She
will
be
constrained
thereto
by
every
*NL*
form
of
law
,
and
notably
by
a
writ
of
distraint
on
her
furniture
and
*NL*
effects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
to
be
done
?
In
twenty-four
hours
--
tomorrow
.
Lheureux
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
wanted
to
frighten
her
again
;
for
she
saw
through
all
his
*NL*
devices
,
the
object
of
his
kindnesses
.
What
reassured
her
was
the
very
*NL*
magnitude
of
the
sum
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
by
dint
of
buying
and
not
paying
,
of
borrowing
,
signing
bills
,
*NL*
and
renewing
these
bills
that
grew
at
each
new
falling-in
,
she
had
ended
*NL*
by
preparing
a
capital
for
Monsieur
Lheureux
which
he
was
impatiently
*NL*
awaiting
for
his
speculations
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
presented
herself
at
his
place
with
an
offhand
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
has
happened
to
me
?
No
doubt
it
's
a
joke
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
slowly
,
and
,
folding
his
arms
,
said
to
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
lady
,
did
you
think
I
should
go
on
to
all
eternity
being
your
*NL*
purveyor
and
banker
,
for
the
love
of
God
?
Now
be
just
.
I
must
get
back
*NL*
what
I
've
laid
out
.
Now
be
just
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
out
against
the
debt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
much
the
worse
.
The
court
has
admitted
it
.
There
's
a
judgment
.
*NL*
It
's
been
notified
to
you
.
Besides
,
it
is
n't
my
fault
.
It
's
Vincart
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
not
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
,
now
talk
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
beating
about
the
bush
;
she
had
known
nothing
about
it
;
it
*NL*
was
a
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
fault
is
that
?
''
said
Lheureux
,
bowing
ironically
.
``
While
I
'm
*NL*
slaving
like
a
nigger
,
you
go
gallivanting
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
no
lecturing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
never
does
any
harm
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
coward
;
she
implored
him
;
she
even
pressed
her
pretty
white
*NL*
and
slender
hand
against
the
shopkeeper
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
that
'll
do
!
Anyone
'd
think
you
wanted
to
seduce
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
wretch
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!
go
it
!
go
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
show
you
up
.
I
shall
tell
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
I
too
.
I
'll
show
your
husband
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Lheureux
drew
from
his
strong
box
the
receipt
for
eighteen
hundred
*NL*
francs
that
she
had
given
him
when
Vincart
had
discounted
the
bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
he
'll
not
understand
your
little
theft
,
*NL*
the
poor
dear
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
collapsed
,
more
overcome
than
if
felled
by
the
blow
of
a
pole-axe
.
*NL*
He
was
walking
up
and
down
from
the
window
to
the
bureau
,
repeating
all
*NL*
the
while
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
'll
show
him
!
I
'll
show
him
!
''
Then
he
approached
her
,
and
in
a
*NL*
soft
voice
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
pleasant
,
I
know
;
but
,
after
all
,
no
bones
are
broken

*NL*
since
that
is
the
only
way
that
is
left
for
you
paying
back
my
money

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
am
I
to
get
any
?
''
said
Emma
,
wringing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
when
one
has
friends
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
looked
at
her
in
so
keen
,
so
terrible
a
fashion
,
that
she
*NL*
shuddered
to
her
very
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
sign
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
enough
of
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
sell
something

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
along
!
''
he
said
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
``
you
've
not
got
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
called
through
the
peep-hole
that
looked
down
into
the
shop
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annette
,
do
n't
forget
the
three
coupons
of
No.
14

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
appeared
.
Emma
understood
,
and
asked
how
much
money
would
be
*NL*
wanted
to
put
a
stop
to
the
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
brought
you
several
thousand
francs

a
quarter
of
the
sum

a
*NL*
third

perhaps
the
whole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
's
no
use
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pushed
her
gently
towards
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
implore
you
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
,
just
a
few
days
more
!
''
She
was
*NL*
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
tears
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
driving
me
to
despair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
care
?
''
said
he
,
shutting
the
door
.

Chapter
Seven
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
stoical
the
next
day
when
Maitre
Hareng
,
the
bailiff
,
with
two
*NL*
assistants
,
presented
himself
at
her
house
to
draw
up
the
inventory
for
*NL*
the
distraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
with
Bovary
's
consulting-room
,
and
did
not
write
down
*NL*
the
phrenological
head
,
which
was
considered
an
``
instrument
of
his
*NL*
profession
''
;
but
in
the
kitchen
they
counted
the
plates
;
the
saucepans
,
*NL*
the
chairs
,
the
candlesticks
,
and
in
the
bedroom
all
the
nick-nacks
on
*NL*
the
whatnot
.
They
examined
her
dresses
,
the
linen
,
the
dressing-room
;
*NL*
and
her
whole
existence
to
its
most
intimate
details
,
was
,
like
a
corpse
*NL*
on
whom
a
post-mortem
is
made
,
outspread
before
the
eyes
of
these
three
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maitre
Hareng
,
buttoned
up
in
his
thin
black
coat
,
wearing
a
white
*NL*
choker
and
very
tight
foot-straps
,
repeated
from
time
to
time
--
``
Allow
*NL*
me
,
madame
.
You
allow
me
?
''
Often
he
uttered
exclamations
.
``
Charming
!
*NL*
very
pretty
.
''
Then
he
began
writing
again
,
dipping
his
pen
into
the
horn
*NL*
inkstand
in
his
left
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
done
with
the
rooms
they
went
up
to
the
attic
.
She
kept
a
*NL*
desk
there
in
which
Rodolphe
's
letters
were
locked
.
It
had
to
be
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
a
correspondence
,
''
said
Maitre
Hareng
,
with
a
discreet
smile
.
``
But
*NL*
allow
me
,
for
I
must
make
sure
the
box
contains
nothing
else
.
''
And
he
*NL*
tipped
up
the
papers
lightly
,
as
if
to
shake
out
napoleons
.
Then
she
*NL*
grew
angered
to
see
this
coarse
hand
,
with
fingers
red
and
pulpy
like
*NL*
slugs
,
touching
these
pages
against
which
her
heart
had
beaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
at
last
.
Felicite
came
back
.
Emma
had
sent
her
out
to
watch
*NL*
for
Bovary
in
order
to
keep
him
off
,
and
they
hurriedly
installed
the
*NL*
man
in
possession
under
the
roof
,
where
he
swore
he
would
remain
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
evening
Charles
seemed
to
her
careworn
.
Emma
watched
him
with
*NL*
a
look
of
anguish
,
fancying
she
saw
an
accusation
in
every
line
of
his
*NL*
face
.
Then
,
when
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
chimney-piece
ornamented
*NL*
with
Chinese
screens
,
over
the
large
curtains
,
the
armchairs
,
all
*NL*
those
things
,
in
a
word
,
that
had
,
softened
the
bitterness
of
her
life
,
*NL*
remorse
seized
her
or
rather
an
immense
regret
,
that
,
far
from
crushing
,
*NL*
irritated
her
passion
.
Charles
placidly
poked
the
fire
,
both
his
feet
on
*NL*
the
fire-dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
the
man
,
no
doubt
bored
in
his
hiding-place
,
made
a
slight
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anyone
walking
upstairs
?
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
;
``
it
is
a
window
that
has
been
left
open
,
and
is
*NL*
rattling
in
the
wind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
Sunday
,
she
went
to
Rouen
to
call
on
all
the
brokers
whose
*NL*
names
she
knew
.
They
were
at
their
country-places
or
on
journeys
.
She
*NL*
was
not
discouraged
;
and
those
whom
she
did
manage
to
see
she
asked
for
*NL*
money
,
declaring
she
must
have
some
,
and
that
she
would
pay
it
back
.
*NL*
Some
laughed
in
her
face
;
all
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
she
hurried
to
Leon
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
No
one
*NL*
answered
.
At
length
he
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brings
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
disturb
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
--
''
And
he
admitted
that
his
landlord
did
n't
like
his
having
*NL*
``
women
''
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
speak
to
you
,
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
took
down
the
key
,
but
she
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
Down
there
,
in
our
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
went
to
their
room
at
the
Hotel
de
Boulogne
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
she
drank
off
a
large
glass
of
water
.
She
was
very
pale
.
She
*NL*
said
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leon
,
you
will
do
me
a
service
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
shaking
him
by
both
hands
that
she
grasped
tightly
,
she
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
I
want
eight
thousand
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
mad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thereupon
,
telling
him
the
story
of
the
distraint
,
she
explained
*NL*
her
distress
to
him
;
for
Charles
knew
nothing
of
it
;
her
mother-in-law
*NL*
detested
her
;
old
Rouault
could
do
nothing
;
but
he
,
Leon
,
he
would
set
*NL*
about
finding
this
indispensable
sum
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
can
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
coward
you
are
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
said
stupidly
,
``
You
are
exaggerating
the
difficulty
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
with
a
thousand
crowns
or
so
the
fellow
could
be
stopped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
greater
reason
to
try
and
do
something
;
it
was
impossible
that
*NL*
they
could
not
find
three
thousand
francs
.
Besides
,
Leon
,
could
be
*NL*
security
instead
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
try
,
try
!
I
will
love
you
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
,
and
came
back
at
the
end
of
an
hour
,
saying
,
with
solemn
*NL*
face
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
to
three
people
with
no
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
remained
sitting
face
to
face
at
the
two
chimney
corners
,
*NL*
motionless
,
in
silence
.
Emma
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
she
stamped
her
*NL*
feet
.
He
heard
her
murmuring
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
in
your
place
_
I
_
should
soon
get
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
office
.
''
And
she
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
infernal
boldness
looked
out
from
her
burning
eyes
,
and
their
lids
*NL*
drew
close
together
with
a
lascivious
and
encouraging
look
,
so
that
the
*NL*
young
man
felt
himself
growing
weak
beneath
the
mute
will
of
this
woman
*NL*
who
was
urging
him
to
a
crime
.
Then
he
was
afraid
,
and
to
avoid
any
*NL*
explanation
he
smote
his
forehead
,
crying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morel
is
to
come
back
to-night
;
he
will
not
refuse
me
,
I
hope
''
-LRB-
this
*NL*
was
one
of
his
friends
,
the
son
of
a
very
rich
merchant
-RRB-
;
``
and
I
will
*NL*
bring
it
you
to-morrow
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
did
not
seem
to
welcome
this
hope
with
all
the
joy
he
had
expected
.
*NL*
Did
she
suspect
the
lie
?
He
went
on
,
blushing
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
if
you
do
n't
see
me
by
three
o'clock
do
not
wait
for
me
,
my
*NL*
darling
.
I
must
be
off
now
;
forgive
me
!
Goodbye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
hand
,
but
it
felt
quite
lifeless
.
Emma
had
no
strength
*NL*
left
for
any
sentiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
o'clock
struck
,
and
she
rose
to
return
to
Yonville
,
mechanically
*NL*
obeying
the
force
of
old
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
fine
.
It
was
one
of
those
March
days
,
clear
and
sharp
,
*NL*
when
the
sun
shines
in
a
perfectly
white
sky
.
The
Rouen
folk
,
in
*NL*
Sunday-clothes
,
were
walking
about
with
happy
looks
.
She
reached
the
*NL*
Place
du
Parvis
.
People
were
coming
out
after
vespers
;
the
crowd
flowed
*NL*
out
through
the
three
doors
like
a
stream
through
the
three
arches
of
*NL*
a
bridge
,
and
in
the
middle
one
,
more
motionless
than
a
rock
,
stood
the
*NL*
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
remembered
the
day
when
,
all
anxious
and
full
of
hope
,
she
had
*NL*
entered
beneath
this
large
nave
,
that
had
opened
out
before
her
,
less
*NL*
profound
than
her
love
;
and
she
walked
on
weeping
beneath
her
veil
,
*NL*
giddy
,
staggering
,
almost
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
!
''
cried
a
voice
issuing
from
the
gate
of
a
courtyard
that
was
*NL*
thrown
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
to
let
pass
a
black
horse
,
pawing
the
ground
between
the
*NL*
shafts
of
a
tilbury
,
driven
by
a
gentleman
in
sable
furs
.
Who
was
it
?
*NL*
She
knew
him
.
The
carriage
darted
by
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
it
was
he
--
the
Viscount
.
She
turned
away
;
the
street
was
empty
.
She
*NL*
was
so
overwhelmed
,
so
sad
,
that
she
had
to
lean
against
a
wall
to
keep
*NL*
herself
from
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
thought
she
had
been
mistaken
.
Anyhow
,
she
did
not
know
.
All
*NL*
within
her
and
around
her
was
abandoning
her
.
She
felt
lost
,
sinking
*NL*
at
random
into
indefinable
abysses
,
and
it
was
almost
with
joy
that
,
on
*NL*
reaching
the
``
Croix-Rouge
,
''
she
saw
the
good
Homais
,
who
was
watching
*NL*
a
large
box
full
of
pharmaceutical
stores
being
hoisted
on
to
the
*NL*
``
Hirondelle
.
''
In
his
hand
he
held
tied
in
a
silk
handkerchief
six
*NL*
cheminots
for
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Homais
was
very
fond
of
these
small
,
heavy
turban-shaped
loaves
,
*NL*
that
are
eaten
in
Lent
with
salt
butter
;
a
last
vestige
of
Gothic
food
*NL*
that
goes
back
,
perhaps
,
to
the
time
of
the
Crusades
,
and
with
which
*NL*
the
robust
Normans
gorged
themselves
of
yore
,
fancying
they
saw
on
the
*NL*
table
,
in
the
light
of
the
yellow
torches
,
between
tankards
of
hippocras
*NL*
and
huge
boars
'
heads
,
the
heads
of
Saracens
to
be
devoured
.
The
*NL*
druggist
's
wife
crunched
them
up
as
they
had
done
--
heroically
,
despite
*NL*
her
wretched
teeth
.
And
so
whenever
Homais
journeyed
to
town
,
he
never
*NL*
failed
to
bring
her
home
some
that
he
bought
at
the
great
baker
's
in
the
*NL*
Rue
Massacre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charmed
to
see
you
,
''
he
said
,
offering
Emma
a
hand
to
help
her
into
the
*NL*
``
Hirondelle
.
''
Then
he
hung
up
his
cheminots
to
the
cords
of
the
netting
,
*NL*
and
remained
bare-headed
in
an
attitude
pensive
and
Napoleonic
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
blind
man
appeared
as
usual
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
*NL*
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
understand
why
the
authorities
tolerate
such
culpable
*NL*
industries
.
Such
unfortunates
should
be
locked
up
and
forced
to
work
.
*NL*
Progress
,
my
word
!
creeps
at
a
snail
's
pace
.
We
are
floundering
about
in
*NL*
mere
barbarism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
man
held
out
his
hat
,
that
flapped
about
at
the
door
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
bag
in
the
lining
that
had
come
unnailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
``
is
a
scrofulous
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
he
knew
the
poor
devil
,
he
pretended
to
see
him
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
murmured
something
about
``
cornea
,
''
``
opaque
cornea
,
''
``
sclerotic
,
''
*NL*
``
facies
,
''
then
asked
him
in
a
paternal
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
have
you
long
had
this
terrible
infirmity
?
Instead
of
*NL*
getting
drunk
at
the
public
,
you
'd
do
better
to
die
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
advised
him
to
take
good
wine
,
good
beer
,
and
good
joints
.
The
blind
*NL*
man
went
on
with
his
song
;
he
seemed
,
moreover
,
almost
idiotic
.
At
last
*NL*
Monsieur
Homais
opened
his
purse
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
there
's
a
sou
;
give
me
back
two
lairds
,
and
do
n't
forget
my
advice
:
*NL*
you
'll
be
the
better
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hivert
openly
cast
some
doubt
on
the
efficacy
of
it
.
But
the
druggist
*NL*
said
that
he
would
cure
himself
with
an
antiphlogistic
pomade
of
his
own
*NL*
composition
,
and
he
gave
his
address
--
``
Monsieur
Homais
,
near
the
market
,
*NL*
pretty
well
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Hivert
,
``
for
all
this
trouble
you
'll
give
us
your
*NL*
performance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
man
sank
down
on
his
haunches
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
*NL*
whilst
he
rolled
his
greenish
eyes
,
lolled
out
his
tongue
,
and
rubbed
*NL*
his
stomach
with
both
hands
as
he
uttered
a
kind
of
hollow
yell
like
a
*NL*
famished
dog
.
Emma
,
filled
with
disgust
,
threw
him
over
her
shoulder
*NL*
a
five-franc
piece
.
It
was
all
her
fortune
.
It
seemed
to
her
very
fine
*NL*
thus
to
throw
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
had
gone
on
again
when
suddenly
Monsieur
Homais
leant
out
*NL*
through
the
window
,
crying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
farinaceous
or
milk
food
,
wear
wool
next
the
skin
,
and
expose
the
*NL*
diseased
parts
to
the
smoke
of
juniper
berries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
well-known
objects
that
defiled
before
her
eyes
*NL*
gradually
diverted
Emma
from
her
present
trouble
.
An
intolerable
fatigue
*NL*
overwhelmed
her
,
and
she
reached
her
home
stupefied
,
discouraged
,
almost
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
what
may
come
!
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
And
then
,
who
knows
?
Why
,
at
*NL*
any
moment
could
not
some
extraordinary
event
occur
?
Lheureux
even
might
*NL*
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
she
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
voices
*NL*
in
the
Place
.
There
was
a
crowd
round
the
market
reading
a
large
bill
*NL*
fixed
to
one
of
the
posts
,
and
she
saw
Justin
,
who
was
climbing
on
to
*NL*
a
stone
and
tearing
down
the
bill
.
But
at
this
moment
the
rural
guard
*NL*
seized
him
by
the
collar
.
Monsieur
Homais
came
out
of
his
shop
,
and
Mere
*NL*
Lefrangois
,
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
,
seemed
to
be
perorating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
!
madame
!
''
cried
Felicite
,
running
in
,
``
it
's
abominable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
poor
girl
,
deeply
moved
,
handed
her
a
yellow
paper
that
she
had
*NL*
just
torn
off
the
door
.
Emma
read
with
a
glance
that
all
her
furniture
*NL*
was
for
sale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
looked
at
one
another
silently
.
The
servant
and
mistress
had
*NL*
no
secret
one
from
the
other
.
At
last
Felicite
sighed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
,
madame
,
I
should
go
to
Monsieur
Guillaumin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
question
meant
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
who
know
the
house
through
the
servant
,
has
the
master
spoken
*NL*
sometimes
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
'd
do
well
to
go
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dressed
,
put
on
her
black
gown
,
and
her
hood
with
jet
beads
,
and
*NL*
that
she
might
not
be
seen
-LRB-
there
was
still
a
crowd
on
the
Place
-RRB-
,
she
*NL*
took
the
path
by
the
river
,
outside
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
reached
the
notary
's
gate
quite
breathless
.
The
sky
was
sombre
,
and
*NL*
a
little
snow
was
falling
.
At
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
Theodore
in
a
*NL*
red
waistcoat
appeared
on
the
steps
;
he
came
to
open
the
door
almost
*NL*
familiarly
,
as
to
an
acquaintance
,
and
showed
her
into
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
porcelain
stove
crackled
beneath
a
cactus
that
filled
up
the
*NL*
niche
in
the
wall
,
and
in
black
wood
frames
against
the
oak-stained
*NL*
paper
hung
Steuben
's
``
Esmeralda
''
and
Schopin
's
``
Potiphar
.
''
The
*NL*
ready-laid
table
,
the
two
silver
chafing-dishes
,
the
crystal
door-knobs
,
*NL*
the
parquet
and
the
furniture
,
all
shone
with
a
scrupulous
,
English
*NL*
cleanliness
;
the
windows
were
ornamented
at
each
corner
with
stained
*NL*
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
this
,
''
thought
Emma
,
``
is
the
dining-room
I
ought
to
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
notary
came
in
pressing
his
palm-leaf
dressing-gown
to
his
breast
*NL*
with
his
left
arm
,
while
with
the
other
hand
he
raised
and
quickly
put
*NL*
on
again
his
brown
velvet
cap
,
pretentiously
cocked
on
the
right
side
,
*NL*
whence
looked
out
the
ends
of
three
fair
curls
drawn
from
the
back
of
*NL*
the
head
,
following
the
line
of
his
bald
skull
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
offered
her
a
seat
he
sat
down
to
breakfast
,
apologising
*NL*
profusely
for
his
rudeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
beg
you
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
madame
?
I
am
listening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
explaining
her
position
to
him
.
Monsieur
Guillaumin
knew
*NL*
it
,
being
secretly
associated
with
the
linendraper
,
from
whom
he
always
*NL*
got
capital
for
the
loans
on
mortgages
that
he
was
asked
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
knew
-LRB-
and
better
than
she
herself
-RRB-
the
long
story
of
the
bills
,
*NL*
small
at
first
,
bearing
different
names
as
endorsers
,
made
out
at
long
*NL*
dates
,
and
constantly
renewed
up
to
the
day
,
when
,
gathering
together
*NL*
all
the
protested
bills
,
the
shopkeeper
had
bidden
his
friend
Vincart
*NL*
take
in
his
own
name
all
the
necessary
proceedings
,
not
wishing
to
pass
*NL*
for
a
tiger
with
his
fellow-citizens
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
mingled
her
story
with
recriminations
against
Lheureux
,
to
which
the
*NL*
notary
replied
from
time
to
time
with
some
insignificant
word
.
Eating
*NL*
his
cutlet
and
drinking
his
tea
,
he
buried
his
chin
in
his
sky-blue
*NL*
cravat
,
into
which
were
thrust
two
diamond
pins
,
held
together
by
a
*NL*
small
gold
chain
;
and
he
smiled
a
singular
smile
,
in
a
sugary
,
ambiguous
*NL*
fashion
.
But
noticing
that
her
feet
were
damp
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
get
closer
to
the
stove
;
put
your
feet
up
against
the
porcelain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
afraid
of
dirtying
it
.
The
notary
replied
in
a
gallant
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
things
spoil
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
tried
to
move
him
,
and
,
growing
moved
herself
,
she
began
*NL*
telling
him
about
the
poorness
of
her
home
,
her
worries
,
her
wants
.
*NL*
He
could
understand
that
;
an
elegant
woman
!
and
,
without
leaving
off
*NL*
eating
,
he
had
turned
completely
round
towards
her
,
so
that
his
knee
*NL*
brushed
against
her
boot
,
whose
sole
curled
round
as
it
smoked
against
*NL*
the
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
asked
for
a
thousand
sous
,
he
closed
his
lips
,
and
declared
*NL*
he
was
very
sorry
he
had
not
had
the
management
of
her
fortune
before
,
*NL*
for
there
were
hundreds
of
ways
very
convenient
,
even
for
a
lady
,
of
*NL*
turning
her
money
to
account
.
They
might
,
either
in
the
turf-peats
*NL*
of
Grumesnil
or
building-ground
at
Havre
,
almost
without
risk
,
have
*NL*
ventured
on
some
excellent
speculations
;
and
he
let
her
consume
herself
*NL*
with
rage
at
the
thought
of
the
fabulous
sums
that
she
would
certainly
*NL*
have
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
that
you
did
n't
come
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hey
?
Did
I
frighten
you
so
much
?
It
is
I
,
on
the
contrary
,
who
*NL*
ought
to
complain
.
We
hardly
know
one
another
;
yet
I
am
very
devoted
to
*NL*
you
.
You
do
not
doubt
that
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
,
took
hers
,
covered
it
with
a
greedy
kiss
,
then
*NL*
held
it
on
his
knee
;
and
he
played
delicately
with
her
fingers
whilst
*NL*
he
murmured
a
thousand
blandishments
.
His
insipid
voice
murmured
like
a
*NL*
running
brook
;
a
light
shone
in
his
eyes
through
the
glimmering
of
his
*NL*
spectacles
,
and
his
hand
was
advancing
up
Emma
's
sleeve
to
press
her
*NL*
arm
.
She
felt
against
her
cheek
his
panting
breath
.
This
man
oppressed
*NL*
her
horribly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
up
and
said
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
am
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
?
''
said
the
notary
,
who
suddenly
became
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
Then
,
yielding
to
the
outburst
of
too
powerful
a
desire
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dragged
himself
towards
her
on
his
knees
,
regardless
of
his
*NL*
dressing-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
pity
's
sake
,
stay
.
I
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
her
by
her
waist
.
Madame
Bovary
's
face
flushed
purple
.
She
*NL*
recoiled
with
a
terrible
look
,
crying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
taking
a
shameless
advantage
of
my
distress
,
sir
!
I
am
to
be
*NL*
pitied
--
not
to
be
sold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notary
remained
quite
stupefied
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
fine
*NL*
embroidered
slippers
.
They
were
a
love
gift
,
and
the
sight
of
them
at
*NL*
last
consoled
him
.
Besides
,
he
reflected
that
such
an
adventure
might
*NL*
have
carried
him
too
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
wretch
!
what
a
scoundrel
!
what
an
infamy
!
''
she
said
to
herself
,
*NL*
as
she
fled
with
nervous
steps
beneath
the
aspens
of
the
path
.
The
*NL*
disappointment
of
her
failure
increased
the
indignation
of
her
outraged
*NL*
modesty
;
it
seemed
to
her
that
Providence
pursued
her
implacably
,
and
,
*NL*
strengthening
herself
in
her
pride
,
she
had
never
felt
so
much
esteem
*NL*
for
herself
nor
so
much
contempt
for
others
.
A
spirit
of
warfare
*NL*
transformed
her
.
She
would
have
liked
to
strike
all
men
,
to
spit
in
*NL*
their
faces
,
to
crush
them
,
and
she
walked
rapidly
straight
on
,
pale
,
*NL*
quivering
,
maddened
,
searching
the
empty
horizon
with
tear-dimmed
eyes
,
*NL*
and
as
it
were
rejoicing
in
the
hate
that
was
choking
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
her
house
a
numbness
came
over
her
.
She
could
not
go
on
;
*NL*
and
yet
she
must
.
Besides
,
whither
could
she
flee
?
*NL*
*NL*
Felicite
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
.
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
two
of
them
went
over
the
various
*NL*
persons
in
Yonville
who
might
perhaps
be
inclined
to
help
her
.
But
each
*NL*
time
that
Felicite
named
someone
Emma
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
they
will
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
master
'll
soon
be
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
well
enough
.
Leave
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
tried
everything
;
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
now
;
and
*NL*
when
Charles
came
in
she
would
have
to
say
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
This
carpet
on
which
you
are
walking
is
no
longer
ours
.
In
*NL*
your
own
house
you
do
not
possess
a
chair
,
a
pin
,
a
straw
,
and
it
is
I
,
*NL*
poor
man
,
who
have
ruined
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
would
be
a
great
sob
;
next
he
would
weep
abundantly
,
and
at
*NL*
last
,
the
surprise
past
,
he
would
forgive
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
murmured
,
grinding
her
teeth
,
``
he
will
forgive
me
,
he
who
*NL*
would
give
a
million
if
I
would
forgive
him
for
having
known
me
!
Never
!
*NL*
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
of
Bovary
's
superiority
to
her
exasperated
her
.
Then
,
*NL*
whether
she
confessed
or
did
not
confess
,
presently
,
immediately
,
*NL*
to-morrow
,
he
would
know
the
catastrophe
all
the
same
;
so
she
must
wait
*NL*
for
this
horrible
scene
,
and
bear
the
weight
of
his
magnanimity
.
The
*NL*
desire
to
return
to
Lheureux
's
seized
her
--
what
would
be
the
use
?
To
*NL*
write
to
her
father
--
it
was
too
late
;
and
perhaps
,
she
began
to
repent
*NL*
now
that
she
had
not
yielded
to
that
other
,
when
she
heard
the
trot
of
*NL*
a
horse
in
the
alley
.
It
was
he
;
he
was
opening
the
gate
;
he
was
whiter
*NL*
than
the
plaster
wall
.
Rushing
to
the
stairs
,
she
ran
out
quickly
to
the
*NL*
square
;
and
the
wife
of
the
mayor
,
who
was
talking
to
Lestiboudois
in
*NL*
front
of
the
church
,
saw
her
go
in
to
the
tax-collector
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurried
off
to
tell
Madame
Caron
,
and
the
two
ladies
went
up
to
*NL*
the
attic
,
and
,
hidden
by
some
linen
spread
across
props
,
stationed
*NL*
themselves
comfortably
for
overlooking
the
whole
of
Binet
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
alone
in
his
garret
,
busy
imitating
in
wood
one
of
those
*NL*
indescribable
bits
of
ivory
,
composed
of
crescents
,
of
spheres
hollowed
*NL*
out
one
within
the
other
,
the
whole
as
straight
as
an
obelisk
,
and
of
no
*NL*
use
whatever
;
and
he
was
beginning
on
the
last
piece
--
he
was
nearing
his
*NL*
goal
.
In
the
twilight
of
the
workshop
the
white
dust
was
flying
from
his
*NL*
tools
like
a
shower
of
sparks
under
the
hoofs
of
a
galloping
horse
;
the
*NL*
two
wheels
were
turning
,
droning
;
Binet
smiled
,
his
chin
lowered
,
his
*NL*
nostrils
distended
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
seemed
lost
in
one
of
those
complete
*NL*
happinesses
that
,
no
doubt
,
belong
only
to
commonplace
occupations
,
*NL*
which
amuse
the
mind
with
facile
difficulties
,
and
satisfy
by
a
*NL*
realisation
of
that
beyond
which
such
minds
have
not
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
there
she
is
!
''
exclaimed
Madame
Tuvache
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
impossible
because
of
the
lathe
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
these
ladies
thought
they
made
out
the
word
``
francs
,
''
and
Madame
*NL*
Tuvache
whispered
in
a
low
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
begging
him
to
give
her
time
for
paying
her
taxes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
!
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
her
walking
up
and
down
,
examining
the
napkin-rings
,
the
*NL*
candlesticks
,
the
banister
rails
against
the
walls
,
while
Binet
stroked
*NL*
his
beard
with
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
she
wants
to
order
something
of
him
?
''
said
Madame
Tuvache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
does
n't
sell
anything
,
''
objected
her
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tax-collector
seemed
to
be
listening
with
wide-open
eyes
,
as
if
he
*NL*
did
not
understand
.
She
went
on
in
a
tender
,
suppliant
manner
.
She
came
*NL*
nearer
to
him
,
her
breast
heaving
;
they
no
longer
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
making
him
advances
?
''
said
Madame
Tuvache
.
Binet
was
scarlet
to
*NL*
his
very
ears
.
She
took
hold
of
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
too
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
no
doubt
she
was
suggesting
something
abominable
to
him
;
for
the
*NL*
tax-collector
--
yet
he
was
brave
,
had
fought
at
Bautzen
and
at
Lutzen
,
*NL*
had
been
through
the
French
campaign
,
and
had
even
been
recommended
for
*NL*
the
cross
--
suddenly
,
as
at
the
sight
of
a
serpent
,
recoiled
as
far
as
he
*NL*
could
from
her
,
crying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
!
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
like
that
ought
to
be
whipped
,
''
said
Madame
Tuvache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
she
?
''
continued
Madame
Caron
,
for
she
had
disappeared
*NL*
whilst
they
spoke
;
then
catching
sight
of
her
going
up
the
Grande
Rue
,
*NL*
and
turning
to
the
right
as
if
making
for
the
cemetery
,
they
were
lost
*NL*
in
conjectures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nurse
Rollet
,
''
she
said
on
reaching
the
nurse
's
,
``
I
am
choking
;
unlace
*NL*
me
!
''
She
fell
on
the
bed
sobbing
.
Nurse
Rollet
covered
her
with
a
*NL*
petticoat
and
remained
standing
by
her
side
.
Then
,
as
she
did
not
*NL*
answer
,
the
good
woman
withdrew
,
took
her
wheel
and
began
spinning
flax
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
leave
off
!
''
she
murmured
,
fancying
she
heard
Binet
's
lathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
bothering
her
?
''
said
the
nurse
to
herself
.
``
Why
has
she
come
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
rushed
thither
;
impelled
by
a
kind
of
horror
that
drove
her
from
*NL*
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lying
on
her
back
,
motionless
,
and
with
staring
eyes
,
she
saw
things
but
*NL*
vaguely
,
although
she
tried
to
with
idiotic
persistence
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
the
scales
on
the
walls
,
two
brands
smoking
end
to
end
,
and
a
long
*NL*
spider
crawling
over
her
head
in
a
rent
in
the
beam
.
At
last
she
began
*NL*
to
collect
her
thoughts
.
She
remembered
--
one
day
--
Leon
--
Oh
!
how
long
*NL*
ago
that
was
--
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
river
,
and
the
clematis
were
*NL*
perfuming
the
air
.
Then
,
carried
away
as
by
a
rushing
torrent
,
she
soon
*NL*
began
to
recall
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mere
Rollet
went
out
,
raised
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
to
that
side
*NL*
of
the
sky
that
was
brightest
,
and
came
back
slowly
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
thanks
,
thanks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
he
would
come
;
he
would
have
found
some
money
.
But
he
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
go
down
yonder
,
not
guessing
she
was
here
,
and
she
told
the
*NL*
nurse
to
run
to
her
house
to
fetch
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
lady
,
I
'm
going
,
I
'm
going
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
now
that
she
had
not
thought
of
him
from
the
first
.
*NL*
Yesterday
he
had
given
his
word
;
he
would
not
break
it
.
And
she
already
*NL*
saw
herself
at
Lheureux
's
spreading
out
her
three
bank-notes
on
his
*NL*
bureau
.
Then
she
would
have
to
invent
some
story
to
explain
matters
to
*NL*
Bovary
.
What
should
it
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
,
however
,
was
a
long
while
gone
.
But
,
as
there
was
no
clock
*NL*
in
the
cot
,
Emma
feared
she
was
perhaps
exaggerating
the
length
of
time
.
*NL*
She
began
walking
round
the
garden
,
step
by
step
;
she
went
into
the
path
*NL*
by
the
hedge
,
and
returned
quickly
,
hoping
that
the
woman
would
have
*NL*
come
back
by
another
road
.
At
last
,
weary
of
waiting
,
assailed
by
fears
*NL*
that
she
thrust
from
her
,
no
longer
conscious
whether
she
had
been
here
*NL*
a
century
or
a
moment
,
she
sat
down
in
a
corner
,
closed
her
eyes
,
and
*NL*
stopped
her
ears
.
The
gate
grated
;
she
sprang
up
.
Before
she
had
spoken
*NL*
Mere
Rollet
said
to
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
at
your
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
one
!
And
the
doctor
is
crying
.
He
is
calling
for
you
;
they
're
*NL*
looking
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
answered
nothing
.
She
gasped
as
she
turned
her
eyes
about
*NL*
her
,
while
the
peasant
woman
,
frightened
at
her
face
,
drew
back
*NL*
instinctively
,
thinking
her
mad
.
Suddenly
she
struck
her
brow
and
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
;
for
the
thought
of
Rodolphe
,
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
*NL*
a
dark
night
,
had
passed
into
her
soul
.
He
was
so
good
,
so
delicate
,
so
*NL*
generous
!
And
besides
,
should
he
hesitate
to
do
her
this
service
,
she
*NL*
would
know
well
enough
how
to
constrain
him
to
it
by
re-waking
,
in
a
*NL*
single
moment
,
their
lost
love
.
So
she
set
out
towards
La
Huchette
,
not
*NL*
seeing
that
she
was
hastening
to
offer
herself
to
that
which
but
a
while
*NL*
ago
had
so
angered
her
,
not
in
the
least
conscious
of
her
prostitution
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Eight
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
herself
as
she
walked
along
,
``
What
am
I
going
to
say
?
How
*NL*
shall
I
begin
?
''
And
as
she
went
on
she
recognised
the
thickets
,
*NL*
the
trees
,
the
sea-rushes
on
the
hill
,
the
chateau
yonder
.
All
the
*NL*
sensations
of
her
first
tenderness
came
back
to
her
,
and
her
poor
aching
*NL*
heart
opened
out
amorously
.
A
warm
wind
blew
in
her
face
;
the
melting
*NL*
snow
fell
drop
by
drop
from
the
buds
to
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
,
as
she
used
to
,
through
the
small
park-gate
.
She
reached
*NL*
the
avenue
bordered
by
a
double
row
of
dense
lime-trees
.
They
were
*NL*
swaying
their
long
whispering
branches
to
and
fro
.
The
dogs
in
their
*NL*
kennels
all
barked
,
and
the
noise
of
their
voices
resounded
,
but
brought
*NL*
out
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
the
large
straight
staircase
with
wooden
balusters
that
led
*NL*
to
the
corridor
paved
with
dusty
flags
,
into
which
several
doors
in
a
*NL*
row
opened
,
as
in
a
monastery
or
an
inn
.
His
was
at
the
top
,
right
*NL*
at
the
end
,
on
the
left
.
When
she
placed
her
fingers
on
the
lock
her
*NL*
strength
suddenly
deserted
her
.
She
was
afraid
,
almost
wished
he
*NL*
would
not
be
there
,
though
this
was
her
only
hope
,
her
last
chance
of
*NL*
salvation
.
She
collected
her
thoughts
for
one
moment
,
and
,
strengthening
*NL*
herself
by
the
feeling
of
present
necessity
,
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
front
of
the
fire
,
both
his
feet
on
the
mantelpiece
,
smoking
a
*NL*
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
it
is
you
!
''
he
said
,
getting
up
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
I
,
Rodolphe
.
I
should
like
to
ask
your
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
despite
all
her
efforts
,
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
open
her
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
changed
;
you
are
charming
as
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
replied
bitterly
,
``
they
are
poor
charms
since
you
disdained
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
a
long
explanation
of
his
conduct
,
excusing
himself
in
*NL*
vague
terms
,
in
default
of
being
able
to
invent
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
yielded
to
his
words
,
still
more
to
his
voice
and
the
sight
of
him
,
*NL*
so
that
,
she
pretended
to
believe
,
or
perhaps
believed
;
in
the
pretext
*NL*
he
gave
for
their
rupture
;
this
was
a
secret
on
which
depended
the
*NL*
honour
,
the
very
life
of
a
third
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
!
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
sadly
.
``
I
have
suffered
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
philosophically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
life
,
''
Emma
went
on
,
``
been
good
to
you
at
least
,
since
our
*NL*
separation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
neither
good
nor
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
never
to
have
parted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
?
''
she
said
,
drawing
nearer
,
and
she
sighed
.
``
Oh
,
Rodolphe
!
*NL*
if
you
but
knew
!
I
loved
you
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
that
she
took
his
hand
,
and
they
remained
some
time
,
their
*NL*
fingers
intertwined
,
like
that
first
day
at
the
Show
.
With
a
gesture
of
*NL*
pride
he
struggled
against
this
emotion
.
But
sinking
upon
his
breast
she
*NL*
said
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
think
I
could
live
without
you
?
One
can
not
lose
the
habit
*NL*
of
happiness
.
I
was
desolate
.
I
thought
I
should
die
.
I
will
tell
you
*NL*
about
all
that
and
you
will
see
.
And
you
--
you
fled
from
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
all
the
three
years
,
he
had
carefully
avoided
her
in
consequence
*NL*
of
that
natural
cowardice
that
characterises
the
stronger
sex
.
Emma
went
*NL*
on
,
with
dainty
little
nods
,
more
coaxing
than
an
amorous
kitten
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
others
,
confess
it
!
Oh
,
I
understand
them
,
dear
!
I
excuse
*NL*
them
.
You
probably
seduced
them
as
you
seduced
me
.
You
are
indeed
a
man
;
*NL*
you
have
everything
to
make
one
love
you
.
But
we
'll
begin
again
,
wo
n't
*NL*
we
?
We
will
love
one
another
.
See
!
I
am
laughing
;
I
am
happy
!
Oh
,
*NL*
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
charming
to
see
,
with
her
eyes
,
in
which
trembled
a
tear
,
*NL*
like
the
rain
of
a
storm
in
a
blue
corolla
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
drawn
her
upon
his
knees
,
and
with
the
back
of
his
hand
was
*NL*
caressing
her
smooth
hair
,
where
in
the
twilight
was
mirrored
like
a
*NL*
golden
arrow
one
last
ray
of
the
sun
.
She
bent
down
her
brow
;
at
last
he
*NL*
kissed
her
on
the
eyelids
quite
gently
with
the
tips
of
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
have
been
crying
!
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
burst
into
tears
.
Rodolphe
thought
this
was
an
outburst
of
her
*NL*
love
.
As
she
did
not
speak
,
he
took
this
silence
for
a
last
remnant
of
*NL*
resistance
,
and
then
he
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
forgive
me
!
You
are
the
only
one
who
pleases
me
.
I
was
imbecile
and
*NL*
cruel
.
I
love
you
.
I
will
love
you
always
.
What
is
it
.
Tell
me
!
''
He
was
*NL*
kneeling
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
ruined
,
Rodolphe
!
You
must
lend
me
three
thousand
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
''
said
he
,
getting
up
slowly
,
while
his
face
assumed
a
grave
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
she
went
on
quickly
,
``
that
my
husband
had
placed
his
whole
*NL*
fortune
at
a
notary
's
.
He
ran
away
.
So
we
borrowed
;
the
patients
do
n't
*NL*
pay
us
.
Moreover
,
the
settling
of
the
estate
is
not
yet
done
;
we
shall
*NL*
have
the
money
later
on
.
But
to-day
,
for
want
of
three
thousand
francs
,
*NL*
we
are
to
be
sold
up
.
It
is
to
be
at
once
,
this
very
moment
,
and
,
*NL*
counting
upon
your
friendship
,
I
have
come
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
thought
Rodolphe
,
turning
very
pale
,
``
that
was
what
she
came
for
.
''
*NL*
At
last
he
said
with
a
calm
air
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
madame
,
I
have
not
got
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
lie
.
If
he
had
had
them
,
he
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
given
them
,
*NL*
although
it
is
generally
disagreeable
to
do
such
fine
things
:
a
demand
*NL*
for
money
being
,
of
all
the
winds
that
blow
upon
love
,
the
coldest
and
*NL*
most
destructive
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
she
looked
at
him
for
some
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
got
them
!
''
she
repeated
several
times
.
``
You
have
not
got
*NL*
them
!
I
ought
to
have
spared
myself
this
last
shame
.
You
never
loved
me
.
*NL*
You
are
no
better
than
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
betraying
,
ruining
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
interrupted
her
,
declaring
he
was
``
hard
up
''
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
pity
you
,
''
said
Emma
.
``
Yes
--
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
fixing
her
eyes
upon
an
embossed
carabine
,
that
shone
against
its
*NL*
panoply
,
``
But
when
one
is
so
poor
one
does
n't
have
silver
on
the
butt
of
*NL*
one
's
gun

One
does
n't
buy
a
clock
inlaid
with
tortoise
shell
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
,
pointing
to
a
buhl
timepiece
,
``
nor
silver-gilt
whistles
for
one
's
*NL*
whips
,
''
and
she
touched
them
,
``
nor
charms
for
one
's
watch

Oh
,
he
wants
*NL*
for
nothing
!
even
to
a
liqueur-stand
in
his
room
!
For
you
love
yourself
;
*NL*
you
live
well

You
have
a
chateau

farms

woods
;
you
go
hunting
;
you
*NL*
travel
to
Paris
.
Why

if
it
were
but
that
,
''
she
cried
,
taking
up
two
*NL*
studs
from
the
mantelpiece
,
``
but
the
least
of
these
trifles
,
one
can
get
*NL*
money
for
them
.
Oh
,
I
do
not
want
them
,
keep
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
threw
the
two
links
away
from
her
,
their
gold
chain
breaking
as
*NL*
it
struck
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
!
I
would
have
given
you
everything
.
I
would
have
sold
all
,
worked
*NL*
for
you
with
my
hands
,
I
would
have
begged
on
the
highroads
for
a
smile
,
*NL*
for
a
look
,
to
hear
you
say
`
Thanks
!
'
And
you
sit
there
quietly
in
your
*NL*
arm-chair
,
as
if
you
had
not
made
me
suffer
enough
already
!
But
for
you
,
*NL*
and
you
know
it
,
I
might
have
lived
happily
.
What
made
you
do
it
?
Was
*NL*
it
a
bet
?
Yet
you
loved
me
--
you
said
so
.
And
but
a
moment
since
--
Ah
!
*NL*
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
driven
me
away
.
My
hands
are
hot
with
*NL*
your
kisses
,
and
there
is
the
spot
on
the
carpet
where
at
my
knees
you
*NL*
swore
an
eternity
of
love
!
You
made
me
believe
you
;
for
two
years
you
*NL*
held
me
in
the
most
magnificent
,
the
sweetest
dream
!
Eh
!
Our
plans
for
*NL*
the
journey
,
do
you
remember
?
Oh
,
your
letter
!
your
letter
!
it
tore
my
*NL*
heart
!
And
then
when
I
come
back
to
him
--
to
him
,
rich
,
happy
,
free
--
to
*NL*
implore
the
help
the
first
stranger
would
give
,
a
suppliant
,
and
*NL*
bringing
back
to
him
all
my
tenderness
,
he
repulses
me
because
it
would
*NL*
cost
him
three
thousand
francs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
got
them
,
''
replied
Rodolphe
,
with
that
perfect
calm
with
*NL*
which
resigned
rage
covers
itself
as
with
a
shield
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
.
The
walls
trembled
,
the
ceiling
was
crushing
her
,
and
she
*NL*
passed
back
through
the
long
alley
,
stumbling
against
the
heaps
of
dead
*NL*
leaves
scattered
by
the
wind
.
At
last
she
reached
the
ha-ha
hedge
in
*NL*
front
of
the
gate
;
she
broke
her
nails
against
the
lock
in
her
haste
to
*NL*
open
it
.
Then
a
hundred
steps
farther
on
,
breathless
,
almost
falling
,
*NL*
she
stopped
.
And
now
turning
round
,
she
once
more
saw
the
impassive
*NL*
chateau
,
with
the
park
,
the
gardens
,
the
three
courts
,
and
all
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
facade
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
lost
in
stupor
,
and
having
no
more
consciousness
of
herself
*NL*
than
through
the
beating
of
her
arteries
,
that
she
seemed
to
hear
*NL*
bursting
forth
like
a
deafening
music
filling
all
the
fields
.
The
earth
*NL*
beneath
her
feet
was
more
yielding
than
the
sea
,
and
the
furrows
seemed
*NL*
to
her
immense
brown
waves
breaking
into
foam
.
Everything
in
her
*NL*
head
,
of
memories
,
ideas
,
went
off
at
once
like
a
thousand
pieces
of
*NL*
fireworks
.
She
saw
her
father
,
Lheureux
's
closet
,
their
room
at
home
,
*NL*
another
landscape
.
Madness
was
coming
upon
her
;
she
grew
afraid
,
and
*NL*
managed
to
recover
herself
,
in
a
confused
way
,
it
is
true
,
for
she
did
*NL*
not
in
the
least
remember
the
cause
of
the
terrible
condition
she
was
*NL*
in
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
question
of
money
.
She
suffered
only
in
her
*NL*
love
,
and
felt
her
soul
passing
from
her
in
this
memory
;
as
wounded
men
,
*NL*
dying
,
feel
their
life
ebb
from
their
bleeding
wounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
falling
,
crows
were
flying
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
fiery
spheres
were
exploding
in
the
air
*NL*
like
fulminating
balls
when
they
strike
,
and
were
whirling
,
whirling
,
*NL*
to
melt
at
last
upon
the
snow
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
.
In
the
*NL*
midst
of
each
of
them
appeared
the
face
of
Rodolphe
.
They
multiplied
and
*NL*
drew
near
her
,
penetrating
,
her
.
It
all
disappeared
;
she
recognised
the
*NL*
lights
of
the
houses
that
shone
through
the
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
her
situation
,
like
an
abyss
,
rose
up
before
her
.
She
was
panting
as
*NL*
if
her
heart
would
burst
.
Then
in
an
ecstasy
of
heroism
,
that
made
*NL*
her
almost
joyous
,
she
ran
down
the
hill
,
crossed
the
cow-plank
,
the
*NL*
foot-path
,
the
alley
,
the
market
,
and
reached
the
chemist
's
shop
.
She
*NL*
was
about
to
enter
,
but
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
someone
might
come
,
and
*NL*
slipping
in
by
the
gate
,
holding
her
breath
,
feeling
her
way
along
the
*NL*
walls
,
she
went
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
kitchen
,
where
a
candle
stuck
*NL*
on
the
stove
was
burning
.
Justin
in
his
shirt-sleeves
was
carrying
out
a
*NL*
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
they
are
dining
;
I
will
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
;
she
tapped
at
the
window
.
He
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
key
!
the
one
for
upstairs
where
he
keeps
the
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
looked
at
her
,
astonished
at
the
pallor
of
her
face
,
that
stood
*NL*
out
white
against
the
black
background
of
the
night
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
him
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
majestic
as
a
phantom
.
Without
*NL*
understanding
what
she
wanted
,
he
had
the
presentiment
of
something
*NL*
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
went
on
quickly
in
a
love
voice
;
in
a
sweet
,
melting
voice
,
``
I
*NL*
want
it
;
give
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
partition
wall
was
thin
,
they
could
hear
the
clatter
of
the
forks
*NL*
on
the
plates
in
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pretended
that
she
wanted
to
kill
the
rats
that
kept
her
from
*NL*
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
stay
!
''
Then
with
an
indifferent
air
,
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
worth
while
;
*NL*
I
'll
tell
him
presently
.
Come
,
light
me
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
the
corridor
into
which
the
laboratory
door
opened
.
Against
*NL*
the
wall
was
a
key
labelled
Capharnaum
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justin
!
''
called
the
druggist
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
followed
her
.
The
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
and
she
went
straight
*NL*
to
the
third
shelf
,
so
well
did
her
memory
guide
her
,
seized
the
blue
*NL*
jar
,
tore
out
the
cork
,
plunged
in
her
hand
,
and
withdrawing
it
full
of
*NL*
a
white
powder
,
she
began
eating
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
he
cried
,
rushing
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
someone
will
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
despair
,
was
calling
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
nothing
,
or
all
the
blame
will
fall
on
your
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
went
home
,
suddenly
calmed
,
and
with
something
of
the
serenity
*NL*
of
one
that
had
performed
a
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Charles
,
distracted
by
the
news
of
the
distraint
,
returned
home
,
*NL*
Emma
had
just
gone
out
.
He
cried
aloud
,
wept
,
fainted
,
but
she
did
not
*NL*
return
.
Where
could
she
be
?
He
sent
Felicite
to
Homais
,
to
Monsieur
*NL*
Tuvache
,
to
Lheureux
,
to
the
``
Lion
d'Or
,
''
everywhere
,
and
in
the
*NL*
intervals
of
his
agony
he
saw
his
reputation
destroyed
,
their
fortune
*NL*
lost
,
Berthe
's
future
ruined
.
By
what
?
--
Not
a
word
!
He
waited
till
six
*NL*
in
the
evening
.
At
last
,
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
,
and
fancying
she
*NL*
had
gone
to
Rouen
,
he
set
out
along
the
highroad
,
walked
a
mile
,
met
no
*NL*
one
,
again
waited
,
and
returned
home
.
She
had
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
matter
?
Why
?
Explain
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
at
her
writing-table
and
wrote
a
letter
,
which
she
sealed
*NL*
slowly
,
adding
the
date
and
the
hour
.
Then
she
said
in
a
solemn
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
to
read
it
to-morrow
;
till
then
,
I
pray
you
,
do
not
ask
me
a
*NL*
single
question
.
No
,
not
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
leave
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lay
down
full
length
on
her
bed
.
A
bitter
taste
that
she
felt
in
her
*NL*
mouth
awakened
her
.
She
saw
Charles
,
and
again
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
studying
herself
curiously
,
to
see
if
she
were
not
suffering
.
*NL*
But
no
!
nothing
as
yet
.
She
heard
the
ticking
of
the
clock
,
the
*NL*
crackling
of
the
fire
,
and
Charles
breathing
as
he
stood
upright
by
her
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
is
but
a
little
thing
,
death
!
''
she
thought
.
``
I
shall
fall
asleep
*NL*
and
all
will
be
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drank
a
mouthful
of
water
and
turned
to
the
wall
.
The
frightful
*NL*
taste
of
ink
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thirsty
;
oh
!
so
thirsty
,
''
she
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Charles
,
who
was
handing
her
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
!
Open
the
window
;
I
am
choking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seized
with
a
sickness
so
sudden
that
she
had
hardly
time
to
*NL*
draw
out
her
handkerchief
from
under
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
away
,
''
she
said
quickly
;
``
throw
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
to
her
;
she
did
not
answer
.
She
lay
motionless
,
afraid
that
*NL*
the
slightest
movement
might
make
her
vomit
.
But
she
felt
an
icy
cold
*NL*
creeping
from
her
feet
to
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
is
beginning
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
with
a
gentle
movement
full
of
*NL*
agony
,
while
constantly
opening
her
mouth
as
if
something
very
heavy
*NL*
were
weighing
upon
her
tongue
.
At
eight
o'clock
the
vomiting
began
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
noticed
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
basin
there
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
white
sediment
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
porcelain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
extraordinary
--
very
singular
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
said
in
a
firm
voice
,
``
No
,
you
are
mistaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
gently
,
and
almost
as
caressing
her
,
he
passed
his
hand
over
her
*NL*
stomach
.
She
uttered
a
sharp
cry
.
He
fell
back
terror-stricken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
began
to
groan
,
faintly
at
first
.
Her
shoulders
were
shaken
by
*NL*
a
strong
shuddering
,
and
she
was
growing
paler
than
the
sheets
in
which
*NL*
her
clenched
fingers
buried
themselves
.
Her
unequal
pulse
was
now
almost
*NL*
imperceptible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drops
of
sweat
oozed
from
her
bluish
face
,
that
seemed
as
if
rigid
in
*NL*
the
exhalations
of
a
metallic
vapour
.
Her
teeth
chattered
,
her
dilated
*NL*
eyes
looked
vaguely
about
her
,
and
to
all
questions
she
replied
only
*NL*
with
a
shake
of
the
head
;
she
even
smiled
once
or
twice
.
Gradually
,
her
*NL*
moaning
grew
louder
;
a
hollow
shriek
burst
from
her
;
she
pretended
she
*NL*
was
better
and
that
she
would
get
up
presently
.
But
she
was
seized
with
*NL*
convulsions
and
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
God
!
It
is
horrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
on
his
knees
by
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
!
what
have
you
eaten
?
Answer
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
looked
at
her
with
a
tenderness
in
his
eyes
such
as
she
had
never
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
--
there
!
''
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
.
He
flew
to
the
*NL*
writing-table
,
tore
open
the
seal
,
and
read
aloud
:
``
Accuse
no
one
.
''
He
*NL*
stopped
,
passed
his
hands
across
his
eyes
,
and
read
it
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
help
--
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
only
keep
repeating
the
word
:
``
Poisoned
!
poisoned
!
''
Felicite
*NL*
ran
to
Homais
,
who
proclaimed
it
in
the
market-place
;
Madame
Lefrancois
*NL*
heard
it
at
the
``
Lion
d'Or
''
;
some
got
up
to
go
and
tell
their
*NL*
neighbours
,
and
all
night
the
village
was
on
the
alert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Distraught
,
faltering
,
reeling
,
Charles
wandered
about
the
room
.
He
*NL*
knocked
against
the
furniture
,
tore
his
hair
,
and
the
chemist
had
never
*NL*
believed
that
there
could
be
so
terrible
a
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
home
to
write
to
Monsieur
Canivet
and
to
Doctor
Lariviere
.
He
*NL*
lost
his
head
,
and
made
more
than
fifteen
rough
copies
.
Hippolyte
went
*NL*
to
Neufchatel
,
and
Justin
so
spurred
Bovary
's
horse
that
he
left
it
*NL*
foundered
and
three
parts
dead
by
the
hill
at
Bois-Guillaume
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
tried
to
look
up
his
medical
dictionary
,
but
could
not
read
it
;
*NL*
the
lines
were
dancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm
,
''
said
the
druggist
;
``
we
have
only
to
administer
a
powerful
*NL*
antidote
.
What
is
the
poison
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
showed
him
the
letter
.
It
was
arsenic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Homais
,
``
we
must
make
an
analysis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
he
knew
that
in
cases
of
poisoning
an
analysis
must
be
made
;
and
the
*NL*
other
,
who
did
not
understand
,
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
anything
!
save
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
going
back
to
her
,
he
sank
upon
the
carpet
,
and
lay
there
with
his
*NL*
head
leaning
against
the
edge
of
her
bed
,
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
``
Soon
I
shall
not
trouble
you
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
was
it
?
Who
drove
you
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
.
``
It
had
to
be
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
n't
you
happy
?
Is
it
my
fault
?
I
did
all
I
could
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
true
--
you
are
good
--
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
passed
her
hand
slowly
over
his
hair
.
The
sweetness
of
this
*NL*
sensation
deepened
his
sadness
;
he
felt
his
whole
being
dissolving
*NL*
in
despair
at
the
thought
that
he
must
lose
her
,
just
when
she
was
*NL*
confessing
more
love
for
him
than
ever
.
And
he
could
think
of
nothing
;
*NL*
he
did
not
know
,
he
did
not
dare
;
the
urgent
need
for
some
immediate
*NL*
resolution
gave
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
had
done
,
she
thought
,
with
all
the
treachery
;
and
meanness
,
*NL*
and
numberless
desires
that
had
tortured
her
.
She
hated
no
one
now
;
a
*NL*
twilight
dimness
was
settling
upon
her
thoughts
,
and
,
of
all
earthly
*NL*
noises
,
Emma
heard
none
but
the
intermittent
lamentations
of
this
poor
*NL*
heart
,
sweet
and
indistinct
like
the
echo
of
a
symphony
dying
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
me
the
child
,
''
she
said
,
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
worse
,
are
you
?
''
asked
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
serious
,
and
still
half-asleep
,
was
carried
in
on
the
*NL*
servant
's
arm
in
her
long
white
nightgown
,
from
which
her
bare
*NL*
feet
peeped
out
.
She
looked
wonderingly
at
the
disordered
room
,
and
*NL*
half-closed
her
eyes
,
dazzled
by
the
candles
burning
on
the
table
.
They
*NL*
reminded
her
,
no
doubt
,
of
the
morning
of
New
Year
's
day
and
Mid-Lent
,
*NL*
when
thus
awakened
early
by
candle-light
she
came
to
her
mother
's
bed
to
*NL*
fetch
her
presents
,
for
she
began
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
it
,
mamma
?
''
And
as
everybody
was
silent
,
``
But
I
ca
n't
see
*NL*
my
little
stocking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felicite
held
her
over
the
bed
while
she
still
kept
looking
towards
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
nurse
taken
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
name
,
that
carried
her
back
to
the
memory
of
her
adulteries
*NL*
and
her
calamities
,
Madame
Bovary
turned
away
her
head
,
as
at
the
*NL*
loathing
of
another
bitterer
poison
that
rose
to
her
mouth
.
But
Berthe
*NL*
remained
perched
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
big
your
eyes
are
,
mamma
!
How
pale
you
are
!
how
hot
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
looked
at
her
.
``
I
am
frightened
!
''
cried
the
child
,
recoiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
took
her
hand
to
kiss
it
;
the
child
struggled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
.
Take
her
away
,
''
cried
Charles
,
who
was
sobbing
in
the
*NL*
alcove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
symptoms
ceased
for
a
moment
;
she
seemed
less
agitated
;
and
at
*NL*
every
insignificant
word
,
at
every
respiration
a
little
more
easy
,
he
*NL*
regained
hope
.
At
last
,
when
Canivet
came
in
,
he
threw
himself
into
his
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
is
you
.
Thanks
!
You
are
good
!
But
she
is
better
.
See
!
look
at
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
colleague
was
by
no
means
of
this
opinion
,
and
,
as
he
said
of
*NL*
himself
,
``
never
beating
about
the
bush
,
''
he
prescribed
,
an
emetic
in
*NL*
order
to
empty
the
stomach
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
soon
began
vomiting
blood
.
Her
lips
became
drawn
.
Her
limbs
were
*NL*
convulsed
,
her
whole
body
covered
with
brown
spots
,
and
her
pulse
*NL*
slipped
beneath
the
fingers
like
a
stretched
thread
,
like
a
harp-string
*NL*
nearly
breaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
she
began
to
scream
horribly
.
She
cursed
the
poison
,
railed
*NL*
at
it
,
and
implored
it
to
be
quick
,
and
thrust
away
with
her
stiffened
*NL*
arms
everything
that
Charles
,
in
more
agony
than
herself
,
tried
to
make
*NL*
her
drink
.
He
stood
up
,
his
handkerchief
to
his
lips
,
with
a
rattling
*NL*
sound
in
his
throat
,
weeping
,
and
choked
by
sobs
that
shook
his
whole
*NL*
body
.
Felicite
was
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
room
.
Homais
,
*NL*
motionless
,
uttered
great
sighs
;
and
Monsieur
Canivet
,
always
retaining
*NL*
his
self-command
,
nevertheless
began
to
feel
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
yet
she
has
been
purged
,
and
from
the
moment
that
the
cause
*NL*
ceases
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
effect
must
cease
,
''
said
Homais
,
``
that
is
evident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
save
her
!
''
cried
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
without
listening
to
the
chemist
,
who
was
still
venturing
the
*NL*
hypothesis
,
``
It
is
perhaps
a
salutary
paroxysm
,
''
Canivet
was
about
to
*NL*
administer
some
theriac
,
when
they
heard
the
cracking
of
a
whip
;
all
the
*NL*
windows
rattled
,
and
a
post-chaise
drawn
by
three
horses
abreast
,
up
to
*NL*
their
ears
in
mud
,
drove
at
a
gallop
round
the
corner
of
the
market
.
It
*NL*
was
Doctor
Lariviere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apparition
of
a
god
would
not
have
caused
more
commotion
.
Bovary
*NL*
raised
his
hands
;
Canivet
stopped
short
;
and
Homais
pulled
off
his
*NL*
skull-cap
long
before
the
doctor
had
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
belonged
to
that
great
school
of
surgery
begotten
of
Bichat
,
to
that
*NL*
generation
,
now
extinct
,
of
philosophical
practitioners
,
who
,
loving
*NL*
their
art
with
a
fanatical
love
,
exercised
it
with
enthusiasm
and
*NL*
wisdom
.
Everyone
in
his
hospital
trembled
when
he
was
angry
;
and
his
*NL*
students
so
revered
him
that
they
tried
,
as
soon
as
they
were
themselves
*NL*
in
practice
,
to
imitate
him
as
much
as
possible
.
So
that
in
all
the
*NL*
towns
about
they
were
found
wearing
his
long
wadded
merino
overcoat
*NL*
and
black
frock-coat
,
whose
buttoned
cuffs
slightly
covered
his
brawny
*NL*
hands
--
very
beautiful
hands
,
and
that
never
knew
gloves
,
as
though
to
be
*NL*
more
ready
to
plunge
into
suffering
.
Disdainful
of
honours
,
of
titles
,
*NL*
and
of
academies
,
like
one
of
the
old
Knight-Hospitallers
,
generous
,
*NL*
fatherly
to
the
poor
,
and
practising
virtue
without
believing
in
it
,
he
*NL*
would
almost
have
passed
for
a
saint
if
the
keenness
of
his
intellect
*NL*
had
not
caused
him
to
be
feared
as
a
demon
.
His
glance
,
more
penetrating
*NL*
than
his
bistouries
,
looked
straight
into
your
soul
,
and
dissected
every
*NL*
lie
athwart
all
assertions
and
all
reticences
.
And
thus
he
went
along
,
*NL*
full
of
that
debonair
majesty
that
is
given
by
the
consciousness
*NL*
of
great
talent
,
of
fortune
,
and
of
forty
years
of
a
labourious
and
*NL*
irreproachable
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
the
door
when
he
saw
the
cadaverous
*NL*
face
of
Emma
stretched
out
on
her
back
with
her
mouth
open
.
Then
,
while
*NL*
apparently
listening
to
Canivet
,
he
rubbed
his
fingers
up
and
down
*NL*
beneath
his
nostrils
,
and
repeated
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
made
a
slow
gesture
with
his
shoulders
.
Bovary
watched
him
;
they
*NL*
looked
at
one
another
;
and
this
man
,
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
sight
*NL*
of
pain
,
could
not
keep
back
a
tear
that
fell
on
his
shirt-frill
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
take
Canivet
into
the
next
room
.
Charles
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
ill
,
is
n't
she
?
If
we
put
on
sinapisms
?
Anything
!
Oh
,
think
*NL*
of
something
,
you
who
have
saved
so
many
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
caught
him
in
both
his
arms
,
and
gazed
at
him
wildly
,
*NL*
imploringly
,
half-fainting
against
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
poor
fellow
,
courage
!
There
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Doctor
Lariviere
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
only
to
give
an
order
to
the
coachman
,
with
Monsieur
*NL*
Canivet
,
who
did
not
care
either
to
have
Emma
die
under
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chemist
rejoined
them
on
the
Place
.
He
could
not
by
temperament
keep
*NL*
away
from
celebrities
,
so
he
begged
Monsieur
Lariviere
to
do
him
the
*NL*
signal
honour
of
accepting
some
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sent
quickly
to
the
``
Lion
d'Or
''
for
some
pigeons
;
to
the
butcher
's
*NL*
for
all
the
cutlets
that
were
to
be
had
;
to
Tuvache
for
cream
;
and
*NL*
to
Lestiboudois
for
eggs
;
and
the
druggist
himself
aided
in
the
*NL*
preparations
,
while
Madame
Homais
was
saying
as
she
pulled
together
the
*NL*
strings
of
her
jacket
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
excuse
us
,
sir
,
for
in
this
poor
place
,
when
one
has
n't
been
*NL*
told
the
night
before
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wine
glasses
!
''
whispered
Homais
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
we
were
in
town
,
we
could
fall
back
upon
stuffed
trotters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
!
Sit
down
,
doctor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
fit
,
after
the
first
few
mouthfuls
,
to
give
some
details
as
*NL*
to
the
catastrophe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
first
had
a
feeling
of
siccity
in
the
pharynx
,
then
intolerable
*NL*
pains
at
the
epigastrium
,
super
purgation
,
coma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
she
poison
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
doctor
,
and
I
do
n't
even
know
where
she
can
have
procured
*NL*
the
arsenious
acid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Justin
,
who
was
just
bringing
in
a
pile
of
plates
,
began
to
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
question
the
young
man
dropped
the
whole
lot
on
the
ground
with
*NL*
a
crash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imbecile
!
''
cried
Homais
,
``
awkward
lout
!
block-head
!
confounded
ass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
controlling
himself
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
,
doctor
,
to
make
an
analysis
,
and
primo
I
delicately
*NL*
introduced
a
tube
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
done
better
,
''
said
the
physician
,
``
to
introduce
your
*NL*
fingers
into
her
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
colleague
was
silent
,
having
just
before
privately
received
a
severe
*NL*
lecture
about
his
emetic
,
so
that
this
good
Canivet
,
so
arrogant
and
so
*NL*
verbose
at
the
time
of
the
clubfoot
,
was
to-day
very
modest
.
He
smiled
*NL*
without
ceasing
in
an
approving
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
dilated
in
Amphytrionic
pride
,
and
the
affecting
thought
of
*NL*
Bovary
vaguely
contributed
to
his
pleasure
by
a
kind
of
egotistic
*NL*
reflex
upon
himself
.
Then
the
presence
of
the
doctor
transported
him
.
*NL*
He
displayed
his
erudition
,
cited
pell-mell
cantharides
,
upas
,
the
*NL*
manchineel
,
vipers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
even
read
that
various
persons
have
found
themselves
*NL*
under
toxicological
symptoms
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
thunderstricken
by
*NL*
black-pudding
that
had
been
subjected
to
a
too
vehement
fumigation
.
*NL*
At
least
,
this
was
stated
in
a
very
fine
report
drawn
up
by
one
of
our
*NL*
pharmaceutical
chiefs
,
one
of
our
masters
,
the
illustrious
Cadet
de
*NL*
Gassicourt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Homais
reappeared
,
carrying
one
of
those
shaky
machines
that
*NL*
are
heated
with
spirits
of
wine
;
for
Homais
liked
to
make
his
coffee
*NL*
at
table
,
having
,
moreover
,
torrefied
it
,
pulverised
it
,
and
mixed
it
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saccharum
,
doctor
?
''
said
he
,
offering
the
sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
had
all
his
children
brought
down
,
anxious
to
have
the
*NL*
physician
's
opinion
on
their
constitutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Monsieur
Lariviere
was
about
to
leave
,
when
Madame
Homais
asked
*NL*
for
a
consultation
about
her
husband
.
He
was
making
his
blood
too
thick
*NL*
by
going
to
sleep
every
evening
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
n't
his
blood
that
's
too
thick
,
''
said
the
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
smiling
a
little
at
his
unnoticed
joke
,
the
doctor
opened
the
*NL*
door
.
But
the
chemist
's
shop
was
full
of
people
;
he
had
the
greatest
*NL*
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
Monsieur
Tuvache
,
who
feared
his
spouse
*NL*
would
get
inflammation
of
the
lungs
,
because
she
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
spitting
on
the
ashes
;
then
of
Monsieur
Binet
,
who
sometimes
experienced
*NL*
sudden
attacks
of
great
hunger
;
and
of
Madame
Caron
,
who
suffered
*NL*
from
tinglings
;
of
Lheureux
,
who
had
vertigo
;
of
Lestiboudois
,
who
had
*NL*
rheumatism
;
and
of
Madame
Lefrancois
,
who
had
heartburn
.
At
last
the
*NL*
three
horses
started
;
and
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
he
had
not
*NL*
shown
himself
at
all
obliging
.
*NL*
*NL*
Public
attention
was
distracted
by
the
appearance
of
Monsieur
*NL*
Bournisien
,
who
was
going
across
the
market
with
the
holy
oil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
,
as
was
due
to
his
principles
,
compared
priests
to
ravens
*NL*
attracted
by
the
odour
of
death
.
The
sight
of
an
ecclesiastic
was
*NL*
personally
disagreeable
to
him
,
for
the
cassock
made
him
think
of
the
*NL*
shroud
,
and
he
detested
the
one
from
some
fear
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
not
shrinking
from
what
he
called
his
mission
,
he
returned
*NL*
to
Bovary
's
in
company
with
Canivet
whom
Monsieur
Lariviere
,
before
*NL*
leaving
,
had
strongly
urged
to
make
this
visit
;
and
he
would
,
but
for
*NL*
his
wife
's
objections
,
have
taken
his
two
sons
with
him
,
in
order
*NL*
to
accustom
them
to
great
occasions
;
that
this
might
be
a
lesson
,
an
*NL*
example
,
a
solemn
picture
,
that
should
remain
in
their
heads
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
when
they
went
in
was
full
of
mournful
solemnity
.
On
the
*NL*
work-table
,
covered
over
with
a
white
cloth
,
there
were
five
or
six
*NL*
small
balls
of
cotton
in
a
silver
dish
,
near
a
large
crucifix
between
*NL*
two
lighted
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
,
her
chin
sunken
upon
her
breast
,
had
her
eyes
inordinately
wide
*NL*
open
,
and
her
poor
hands
wandered
over
the
sheets
with
that
hideous
*NL*
and
soft
movement
of
the
dying
,
that
seems
as
if
they
wanted
already
to
*NL*
cover
themselves
with
the
shroud
.
Pale
as
a
statue
and
with
eyes
red
as
*NL*
fire
,
Charles
,
not
weeping
,
stood
opposite
her
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
*NL*
while
the
priest
,
bending
one
knee
,
was
muttering
words
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
face
slowly
,
and
seemed
filled
with
joy
on
seeing
*NL*
suddenly
the
violet
stole
,
no
doubt
finding
again
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
a
temporary
lull
in
her
pain
,
the
lost
voluptuousness
of
her
first
*NL*
mystical
transports
,
with
the
visions
of
eternal
beatitude
that
were
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
rose
to
take
the
crucifix
;
then
she
stretched
forward
her
*NL*
neck
as
one
who
is
athirst
,
and
glueing
her
lips
to
the
body
of
the
*NL*
Man-God
,
she
pressed
upon
it
with
all
her
expiring
strength
the
fullest
*NL*
kiss
of
love
that
she
had
ever
given
.
Then
he
recited
the
Misereatur
and
*NL*
the
Indulgentiam
,
dipped
his
right
thumb
in
the
oil
,
and
began
to
give
*NL*
extreme
unction
.
First
upon
the
eyes
,
that
had
so
coveted
all
worldly
*NL*
pomp
;
then
upon
the
nostrils
,
that
had
been
greedy
of
the
warm
breeze
*NL*
and
amorous
odours
;
then
upon
the
mouth
,
that
had
uttered
lies
,
that
had
*NL*
curled
with
pride
and
cried
out
in
lewdness
;
then
upon
the
hands
that
*NL*
had
delighted
in
sensual
touches
;
and
finally
upon
the
soles
of
the
*NL*
feet
,
so
swift
of
yore
,
when
she
was
running
to
satisfy
her
desires
,
and
*NL*
that
would
now
walk
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
wiped
his
fingers
,
threw
the
bit
of
cotton
dipped
in
oil
into
*NL*
the
fire
,
and
came
and
sat
down
by
the
dying
woman
,
to
tell
her
that
*NL*
she
must
now
blend
her
sufferings
with
those
of
Jesus
Christ
and
abandon
*NL*
herself
to
the
divine
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finishing
his
exhortations
,
he
tried
to
place
in
her
hand
a
blessed
*NL*
candle
,
symbol
of
the
celestial
glory
with
which
she
was
soon
to
be
*NL*
surrounded
.
Emma
,
too
weak
,
could
not
close
her
fingers
,
and
the
taper
,
*NL*
but
for
Monsieur
Bournisien
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
was
not
quite
so
pale
,
and
her
face
had
an
expression
of
*NL*
serenity
as
if
the
sacrament
had
cured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
did
not
fail
to
point
this
out
;
he
even
explained
to
Bovary
*NL*
that
the
Lord
sometimes
prolonged
the
life
of
persons
when
he
thought
it
*NL*
meet
for
their
salvation
;
and
Charles
remembered
the
day
when
,
so
near
*NL*
death
,
she
had
received
the
communion
.
Perhaps
there
was
no
need
to
*NL*
despair
,
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
she
looked
around
her
slowly
,
as
one
awakening
from
a
dream
;
*NL*
then
in
a
distinct
voice
she
asked
for
her
looking-glass
,
and
remained
*NL*
some
time
bending
over
it
,
until
the
big
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
.
Then
*NL*
she
turned
away
her
head
with
a
sigh
and
fell
back
upon
the
pillows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
chest
soon
began
panting
rapidly
;
the
whole
of
her
tongue
protruded
*NL*
from
her
mouth
;
her
eyes
,
as
they
rolled
,
grew
paler
,
like
the
two
*NL*
globes
of
a
lamp
that
is
going
out
,
so
that
one
might
have
thought
*NL*
her
already
dead
but
for
the
fearful
labouring
of
her
ribs
,
shaken
*NL*
by
violent
breathing
,
as
if
the
soul
were
struggling
to
free
itself
.
*NL*
Felicite
knelt
down
before
the
crucifix
,
and
the
druggist
himself
*NL*
slightly
bent
his
knees
,
while
Monsieur
Canivet
looked
out
vaguely
at
*NL*
the
Place
.
Bournisien
had
again
begun
to
pray
,
his
face
bowed
against
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
his
long
black
cassock
trailing
behind
him
in
the
*NL*
room
.
Charles
was
on
the
other
side
,
on
his
knees
,
his
arms
outstretched
*NL*
towards
Emma
.
He
had
taken
her
hands
and
pressed
them
,
shuddering
at
*NL*
every
beat
of
her
heart
,
as
at
the
shaking
of
a
falling
ruin
.
As
the
*NL*
death-rattle
became
stronger
the
priest
prayed
faster
;
his
prayers
*NL*
mingled
with
the
stifled
sobs
of
Bovary
,
and
sometimes
all
seemed
lost
*NL*
in
the
muffled
murmur
of
the
Latin
syllables
that
tolled
like
a
passing
*NL*
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
on
the
pavement
was
heard
a
loud
noise
of
clogs
and
the
*NL*
clattering
of
a
stick
;
and
a
voice
rose
--
a
raucous
voice
--
that
sang
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maids
in
the
warmth
of
a
summer
day
Dream
of
love
and
of
love
always
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
raised
herself
like
a
galvanised
corpse
,
her
hair
undone
,
her
eyes
*NL*
fixed
,
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
sickle
blades
have
been
,
Nannette
,
gathering
ears
of
corn
,
*NL*
Passes
bending
down
,
my
queen
,
To
the
earth
where
they
were
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
blind
man
!
''
she
cried
.
And
Emma
began
to
laugh
,
an
atrocious
,
*NL*
frantic
,
despairing
laugh
,
thinking
she
saw
the
hideous
face
of
the
poor
*NL*
wretch
that
stood
out
against
the
eternal
night
like
a
menace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wind
is
strong
this
summer
day
,
Her
petticoat
has
flown
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
back
upon
the
mattress
in
a
convulsion
.
They
all
drew
near
.
She
*NL*
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Nine
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
always
after
the
death
of
anyone
a
kind
of
stupefaction
;
*NL*
so
difficult
is
it
to
grasp
this
advent
of
nothingness
and
to
resign
*NL*
ourselves
to
believe
in
it
.
But
still
,
when
he
saw
that
she
did
not
*NL*
move
,
Charles
threw
himself
upon
her
,
crying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
!
farewell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
and
Canivet
dragged
him
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Restrain
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
said
he
,
struggling
,
``
I
'll
be
quiet
.
I
'll
not
do
anything
.
But
*NL*
leave
me
alone
.
I
want
to
see
her
.
She
is
my
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cry
,
''
said
the
chemist
;
``
let
nature
take
her
course
;
that
will
solace
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weaker
than
a
child
,
Charles
let
himself
be
led
downstairs
into
the
*NL*
sitting-room
,
and
Monsieur
Homais
soon
went
home
.
On
the
Place
he
*NL*
was
accosted
by
the
blind
man
,
who
,
having
dragged
himself
as
far
as
*NL*
Yonville
,
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
antiphlogistic
pomade
,
was
asking
*NL*
every
passer-by
where
the
druggist
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
as
if
I
had
n't
got
other
fish
to
fry
.
Well
,
so
much
the
*NL*
worse
;
you
must
come
later
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
entered
the
shop
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
write
two
letters
,
to
prepare
a
soothing
potion
for
Bovary
,
to
*NL*
invent
some
lie
that
would
conceal
the
poisoning
,
and
work
it
up
into
an
*NL*
article
for
the
``
Fanal
,
''
without
counting
the
people
who
were
waiting
to
*NL*
get
the
news
from
him
;
and
when
the
Yonvillers
had
all
heard
his
story
*NL*
of
the
arsenic
that
she
had
mistaken
for
sugar
in
making
a
vanilla
*NL*
cream
.
Homais
once
more
returned
to
Bovary
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
him
alone
-LRB-
Monsieur
Canivet
had
left
-RRB-
,
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
*NL*
near
the
window
,
staring
with
an
idiotic
look
at
the
flags
of
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
``
you
ought
yourself
to
fix
the
hour
for
the
*NL*
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
What
ceremony
?
''
Then
,
in
a
stammering
,
frightened
voice
,
``
Oh
,
no
!
*NL*
not
that
.
No
!
I
want
to
see
her
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
,
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
,
took
up
a
water-bottle
on
the
*NL*
whatnot
to
water
the
geraniums
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
thanks
,
''
said
Charles
;
``
you
are
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
finish
,
choking
beneath
the
crowd
of
memories
that
this
*NL*
action
of
the
druggist
recalled
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
to
distract
him
,
Homais
thought
fit
to
talk
a
little
horticulture
:
*NL*
plants
wanted
humidity
.
Charles
bowed
his
head
in
sign
of
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
the
fine
days
will
soon
be
here
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Bovary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
,
at
his
wit
's
end
,
began
softly
to
draw
aside
the
small
*NL*
window-curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
there
's
Monsieur
Tuvache
passing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
repeated
like
a
machine
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Tuvache
passing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
did
not
dare
to
speak
to
him
again
about
the
funeral
*NL*
arrangements
;
it
was
the
priest
who
succeeded
in
reconciling
him
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shut
himself
up
in
his
consulting-room
,
took
a
pen
,
and
after
sobbing
*NL*
for
some
time
,
wrote
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
her
to
be
buried
in
her
wedding-dress
,
with
white
shoes
,
and
a
*NL*
wreath
.
Her
hair
is
to
be
spread
out
over
her
shoulders
.
Three
coffins
,
*NL*
one
of
oak
,
one
of
mahogany
,
one
of
lead
.
Let
no
one
say
anything
to
me
.
*NL*
I
shall
have
strength
.
Over
all
there
is
to
be
placed
a
large
piece
of
*NL*
green
velvet
.
This
is
my
wish
;
see
that
it
is
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
were
much
surprised
at
Bovary
's
romantic
ideas
.
The
chemist
*NL*
at
once
went
to
him
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
velvet
seems
to
me
a
superfetation
.
Besides
,
the
expense
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
to
you
?
''
cried
Charles
.
``
Leave
me
!
You
did
not
love
her
.
*NL*
Go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
took
him
by
the
arm
for
a
turn
in
the
garden
.
He
discoursed
*NL*
on
the
vanity
of
earthly
things
.
God
was
very
great
,
was
very
good
:
one
*NL*
must
submit
to
his
decrees
without
a
murmur
;
nay
,
must
even
thank
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
burst
out
into
blasphemies
:
``
I
hate
your
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spirit
of
rebellion
is
still
upon
you
,
''
sighed
the
ecclesiastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bovary
was
far
away
.
He
was
walking
with
great
strides
along
by
the
*NL*
wall
,
near
the
espalier
,
and
he
ground
his
teeth
;
he
raised
to
heaven
*NL*
looks
of
malediction
,
but
not
so
much
as
a
leaf
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fine
rain
was
falling
:
Charles
,
whose
chest
was
bare
,
at
last
began
to
*NL*
shiver
;
he
went
in
and
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
a
noise
like
a
clatter
of
old
iron
was
heard
on
the
*NL*
Place
;
it
was
the
``
Hirondelle
''
coming
in
,
and
he
remained
with
his
*NL*
forehead
against
the
windowpane
,
watching
all
the
passengers
get
*NL*
out
,
one
after
the
other
.
Felicite
put
down
a
mattress
for
him
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
He
threw
himself
upon
it
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
a
philosopher
,
Monsieur
Homais
respected
the
dead
.
So
bearing
*NL*
no
grudge
to
poor
Charles
,
he
came
back
again
in
the
evening
to
sit
up
*NL*
with
the
body
;
bringing
with
him
three
volumes
and
a
pocket-book
for
*NL*
taking
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Bournisien
was
there
,
and
two
large
candles
were
burning
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
bed
,
that
had
been
taken
out
of
the
alcove
.
The
druggist
,
on
*NL*
whom
the
silence
weighed
,
was
not
long
before
he
began
formulating
some
*NL*
regrets
about
this
``
unfortunate
young
woman
.
''
and
the
priest
replied
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
but
pray
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
Homais
went
on
,
``
one
of
two
things
;
either
she
died
in
a
state
of
*NL*
grace
-LRB-
as
the
Church
has
it
-RRB-
,
and
then
she
has
no
need
of
our
prayers
;
*NL*

else
she
departed

that
is

I
believe
,
the
ecclesiastical
*NL*
expression

,
and
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bournisien
interrupted
him
,
replying
testily
that
it
was
none
the
less
*NL*
necessary
to
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
objected
the
chemist
,
``
since
God
knows
all
our
needs
,
what
can
be
*NL*
the
good
of
prayer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
the
ecclesiastic
,
``
prayer
!
Why
,
are
n't
you
a
Christian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
Homais
;
``
I
admire
Christianity
.
To
begin
with

it
*NL*
enfranchised
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

oh
!

to

have
been
falsified
by
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
came
in
,
and
advancing
towards
the
bed
,
slowly
drew
the
*NL*
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
's
head
was
turned
towards
her
right
shoulder
,
the
corner
of
her
*NL*
mouth
,
which
was
open
,
seemed
like
a
black
hole
at
the
lower
part
of
her
*NL*
face
;
her
two
thumbs
were
bent
into
the
palms
of
her
hands
;
a
kind
*NL*
of
white
dust
besprinkled
her
lashes
,
and
her
eyes
were
beginning
to
*NL*
disappear
in
that
viscous
pallor
that
looks
like
a
thin
web
,
as
if
*NL*
spiders
had
spun
it
over
.
The
sheet
sunk
in
from
her
breast
to
her
*NL*
knees
,
and
then
rose
at
the
tips
of
her
toes
,
and
it
seemed
to
Charles
*NL*
that
infinite
masses
,
an
enormous
load
,
were
weighing
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
clock
struck
two
.
They
could
hear
the
loud
murmur
of
the
*NL*
river
flowing
in
the
darkness
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
.
Monsieur
*NL*
Bournisien
from
time
to
time
blew
his
nose
noisily
,
and
Homais
'
pen
was
*NL*
scratching
over
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
good
friend
,
''
he
said
,
``
withdraw
;
this
spectacle
is
tearing
*NL*
you
to
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
once
gone
,
the
chemist
and
the
cure
recommenced
their
*NL*
discussions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
Voltaire
,
''
said
the
one
,
``
read
D'Holbach
,
read
the
*NL*
`
Encyclopaedia
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
the
`
Letters
of
some
Portuguese
Jews
,
'
''
said
the
other
;
``
read
`
The
*NL*
Meaning
of
Christianity
,
'
by
Nicolas
,
formerly
a
magistrate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
grew
warm
,
they
grew
red
,
they
both
talked
at
once
without
*NL*
listening
to
each
other
.
Bournisien
was
scandalized
at
such
audacity
;
*NL*
Homais
marvelled
at
such
stupidity
;
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
*NL*
insulting
one
another
when
Charles
suddenly
reappeared
.
A
fascination
*NL*
drew
him
.
He
was
continually
coming
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
opposite
her
,
the
better
to
see
her
,
and
he
lost
himself
in
a
*NL*
contemplation
so
deep
that
it
was
no
longer
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recalled
stories
of
catalepsy
,
the
marvels
of
magnetism
,
and
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
that
by
willing
it
with
all
his
force
he
might
perhaps
*NL*
succeed
in
reviving
her
.
Once
he
even
bent
towards
he
,
and
cried
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
,
``
Emma
!
Emma
!
''
His
strong
breathing
made
the
flames
of
the
*NL*
candles
tremble
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
Madame
Bovary
senior
arrived
.
Charles
as
he
embraced
her
*NL*
burst
into
another
flood
of
tears
.
She
tried
,
as
the
chemist
had
done
,
*NL*
to
make
some
remarks
to
him
on
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
.
He
became
so
*NL*
angry
that
she
was
silent
,
and
he
even
commissioned
her
to
go
to
town
at
*NL*
once
and
buy
what
was
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
remained
alone
the
whole
afternoon
;
they
had
taken
Berthe
*NL*
to
Madame
Homais
'
;
Felicite
was
in
the
room
upstairs
with
Madame
*NL*
Lefrancois
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
had
some
visitors
.
He
rose
,
pressed
their
hands
,
*NL*
unable
to
speak
.
Then
they
sat
down
near
one
another
,
and
formed
a
large
*NL*
semicircle
in
front
of
the
fire
.
With
lowered
faces
,
and
swinging
one
*NL*
leg
crossed
over
the
other
knee
,
they
uttered
deep
sighs
at
intervals
;
*NL*
each
one
was
inordinately
bored
,
and
yet
none
would
be
the
first
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
,
when
he
returned
at
nine
o'clock
-LRB-
for
the
last
two
days
only
*NL*
Homais
seemed
to
have
been
on
the
Place
-RRB-
,
was
laden
with
a
stock
of
*NL*
camphor
,
of
benzine
,
and
aromatic
herbs
.
He
also
carried
a
large
jar
*NL*
full
of
chlorine
water
,
to
keep
off
all
miasmata
.
Just
then
the
servant
,
*NL*
Madame
Lefrancois
,
and
Madame
Bovary
senior
were
busy
about
Emma
,
*NL*
finishing
dressing
her
,
and
they
were
drawing
down
the
long
stiff
veil
*NL*
that
covered
her
to
her
satin
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felicite
was
sobbing
--
``
Ah
!
my
poor
mistress
!
my
poor
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
her
,
''
said
the
landlady
,
sighing
;
``
how
pretty
she
still
is
!
*NL*
Now
,
could
n't
you
swear
she
was
going
to
get
up
in
a
minute
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
bent
over
her
to
put
on
her
wreath
.
They
had
to
raise
the
head
*NL*
a
little
,
and
a
rush
of
black
liquid
issued
,
as
if
she
were
vomiting
,
*NL*
from
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
goodness
!
The
dress
;
take
care
!
''
cried
Madame
Lefrancois
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
just
come
and
help
,
''
she
said
to
the
chemist
.
``
Perhaps
you
're
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
afraid
?
''
replied
he
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
``
I
dare
say
!
I
've
seen
*NL*
all
sorts
of
things
at
the
hospital
when
I
was
studying
pharmacy
.
We
*NL*
used
to
make
punch
in
the
dissecting
room
!
Nothingness
does
not
terrify
*NL*
a
philosopher
;
and
,
as
I
often
say
,
I
even
intend
to
leave
my
body
to
*NL*
the
hospitals
,
in
order
,
later
on
,
to
serve
science
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
on
his
arrival
inquired
how
Monsieur
Bovary
was
,
and
,
on
*NL*
the
reply
of
the
druggist
,
went
on
--
``
The
blow
,
you
see
,
is
still
too
*NL*
recent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Homais
congratulated
him
on
not
being
exposed
,
like
other
people
,
*NL*
to
the
loss
of
a
beloved
companion
;
whence
there
followed
a
discussion
*NL*
on
the
celibacy
of
priests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
,
''
said
the
chemist
,
``
it
is
unnatural
that
a
man
should
do
without
*NL*
women
!
There
have
been
crimes
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
good
heaven
!
''
cried
the
ecclesiastic
,
``
how
do
you
expect
an
*NL*
individual
who
is
married
to
keep
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
,
for
*NL*
example
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
fell
foul
of
the
confessional
.
Bournisien
defended
it
;
he
*NL*
enlarged
on
the
acts
of
restitution
that
it
brought
about
.
He
cited
*NL*
various
anecdotes
about
thieves
who
had
suddenly
become
honest
.
Military
*NL*
men
on
approaching
the
tribunal
of
penitence
had
felt
the
scales
fall
*NL*
from
their
eyes
.
At
Fribourg
there
was
a
minister
--
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
was
asleep
.
Then
he
felt
somewhat
stifled
by
the
*NL*
over-heavy
atmosphere
of
the
room
;
he
opened
the
window
;
this
awoke
the
*NL*
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
``
Take
it
;
it
'll
relieve
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
continual
barking
was
heard
in
the
distance
.
``
Do
you
hear
that
dog
*NL*
howling
?
''
said
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
smell
the
dead
,
''
replied
the
priest
.
``
It
's
like
bees
;
they
leave
*NL*
their
hives
on
the
decease
of
any
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Homais
made
no
remark
upon
these
prejudices
,
for
he
had
again
dropped
*NL*
asleep
.
Monsieur
Bournisien
,
stronger
than
he
,
went
on
moving
his
lips
*NL*
gently
for
some
time
,
then
insensibly
his
chin
sank
down
,
he
let
fall
*NL*
his
big
black
boot
,
and
began
to
snore
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
opposite
one
another
,
with
protruding
stomachs
,
puffed-up
*NL*
faces
,
and
frowning
looks
,
after
so
much
disagreement
uniting
at
last
in
*NL*
the
same
human
weakness
,
and
they
moved
no
more
than
the
corpse
by
their
*NL*
side
,
that
seemed
to
be
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
coming
in
did
not
wake
them
.
It
was
the
last
time
;
he
came
to
*NL*
bid
her
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aromatic
herbs
were
still
smoking
,
and
spirals
of
bluish
vapour
*NL*
blended
at
the
window-sash
with
the
fog
that
was
coming
in
.
There
were
*NL*
few
stars
,
and
the
night
was
warm
.
The
wax
of
the
candles
fell
in
great
*NL*
drops
upon
the
sheets
of
the
bed
.
Charles
watched
them
burn
,
tiring
his
*NL*
eyes
against
the
glare
of
their
yellow
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
watering
on
the
satin
gown
shimmered
white
as
moonlight
.
Emma
was
*NL*
lost
beneath
it
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
,
spreading
beyond
her
own
*NL*
self
,
she
blended
confusedly
with
everything
around
her
--
the
silence
,
*NL*
the
night
,
the
passing
wind
,
the
damp
odours
rising
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
he
saw
her
in
the
garden
at
Tostes
,
on
a
bench
against
the
*NL*
thorn
hedge
,
or
else
at
Rouen
in
the
streets
,
on
the
threshold
of
their
*NL*
house
,
in
the
yard
at
Bertaux
.
He
again
heard
the
laughter
of
the
happy
*NL*
boys
beneath
the
apple-trees
:
the
room
was
filled
with
the
perfume
*NL*
of
her
hair
;
and
her
dress
rustled
in
his
arms
with
a
noise
like
*NL*
electricity
.
The
dress
was
still
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
while
he
thus
recalled
all
his
lost
joys
,
her
attitudes
,
*NL*
her
movements
,
the
sound
of
her
voice
.
Upon
one
fit
of
despair
followed
*NL*
another
,
and
even
others
,
inexhaustible
as
the
waves
of
an
overflowing
*NL*
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
curiosity
seized
him
.
Slowly
,
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
,
*NL*
palpitating
,
he
lifted
her
veil
.
But
he
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
that
*NL*
awoke
the
other
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dragged
him
down
into
the
sitting-room
.
Then
Felicite
came
up
to
*NL*
say
that
he
wanted
some
of
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
some
off
,
''
replied
the
druggist
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
she
did
not
dare
to
,
he
himself
stepped
forward
,
scissors
in
*NL*
hand
.
He
trembled
so
that
he
pierced
the
skin
of
the
temple
in
several
*NL*
places
.
At
last
,
stiffening
himself
against
emotion
,
Homais
gave
two
*NL*
or
three
great
cuts
at
random
that
left
white
patches
amongst
that
*NL*
beautiful
black
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chemist
and
the
cure
plunged
anew
into
their
occupations
,
not
*NL*
without
sleeping
from
time
to
time
,
of
which
they
accused
each
other
*NL*
reciprocally
at
each
fresh
awakening
.
Then
Monsieur
Bournisien
sprinkled
*NL*
the
room
with
holy
water
and
Homais
threw
a
little
chlorine
water
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felicite
had
taken
care
to
put
on
the
chest
of
drawers
,
for
each
*NL*
of
them
,
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
some
cheese
,
and
a
large
roll
.
And
the
*NL*
druggist
,
who
could
not
hold
out
any
longer
,
about
four
in
the
morning
*NL*
sighed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
I
should
like
to
take
some
sustenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
did
not
need
any
persuading
;
he
went
out
to
go
and
say
mass
,
*NL*
came
back
,
and
then
they
ate
and
hobnobbed
,
giggling
a
little
without
*NL*
knowing
why
,
stimulated
by
that
vague
gaiety
that
comes
upon
us
after
*NL*
times
of
sadness
,
and
at
the
last
glass
the
priest
said
to
the
druggist
,
*NL*
as
he
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
end
by
understanding
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
passage
downstairs
they
met
the
undertaker
's
men
,
who
were
coming
*NL*
in
.
Then
Charles
for
two
hours
had
to
suffer
the
torture
of
hearing
the
*NL*
hammer
resound
against
the
wood
.
Next
day
they
lowered
her
into
her
*NL*
oak
coffin
,
that
was
fitted
into
the
other
two
;
but
as
the
bier
was
*NL*
too
large
,
they
had
to
fill
up
the
gaps
with
the
wool
of
a
mattress
.
At
*NL*
last
,
when
the
three
lids
had
been
planed
down
,
nailed
,
soldered
,
it
was
*NL*
placed
outside
in
front
of
the
door
;
the
house
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
*NL*
people
of
Yonville
began
to
flock
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Rouault
arrived
,
and
fainted
on
the
Place
when
he
saw
the
black
*NL*
cloth
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Ten
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
only
received
the
chemist
's
letter
thirty-six
hours
after
the
*NL*
event
;
and
,
from
consideration
for
his
feelings
,
Homais
had
so
worded
it
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
the
old
fellow
had
fallen
as
if
struck
by
apoplexy
.
Next
,
he
*NL*
understood
that
she
was
not
dead
,
but
she
might
be
.
At
last
,
he
had
put
*NL*
on
his
blouse
,
taken
his
hat
,
fastened
his
spurs
to
his
boots
,
and
set
*NL*
out
at
full
speed
;
and
the
whole
of
the
way
old
Rouault
,
panting
,
was
*NL*
torn
by
anguish
.
Once
even
he
was
obliged
to
dismount
.
He
was
dizzy
;
he
*NL*
heard
voices
round
about
him
;
he
felt
himself
going
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
broke
.
He
saw
three
black
hens
asleep
in
a
tree
.
He
shuddered
,
*NL*
horrified
at
this
omen
.
Then
he
promised
the
Holy
Virgin
three
chasubles
*NL*
for
the
church
,
and
that
he
would
go
barefooted
from
the
cemetery
at
*NL*
Bertaux
to
the
chapel
of
Vassonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
Maromme
shouting
for
the
people
of
the
inn
,
burst
open
the
*NL*
door
with
a
thrust
of
his
shoulder
,
made
for
a
sack
of
oats
,
emptied
a
*NL*
bottle
of
sweet
cider
into
the
manger
,
and
again
mounted
his
nag
,
whose
*NL*
feet
struck
fire
as
it
dashed
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
that
no
doubt
they
would
save
her
;
the
doctors
would
*NL*
discover
some
remedy
surely
.
He
remembered
all
the
miraculous
cures
*NL*
he
had
been
told
about
.
Then
she
appeared
to
him
dead
.
She
was
there
;
*NL*
before
his
eyes
,
lying
on
her
back
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
He
reined
*NL*
up
,
and
the
hallucination
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Quincampoix
,
to
give
himself
heart
,
he
drank
three
cups
of
coffee
*NL*
one
after
the
other
.
He
fancied
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
name
in
*NL*
writing
.
He
looked
for
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
felt
it
there
,
but
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
open
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
began
to
think
it
was
all
a
joke
;
someone
's
spite
,
the
jest
*NL*
of
some
wag
;
and
besides
,
if
she
were
dead
,
one
would
have
known
it
.
But
*NL*
no
!
There
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
the
country
;
the
sky
was
blue
,
*NL*
the
trees
swayed
;
a
flock
of
sheep
passed
.
He
saw
the
village
;
he
was
*NL*
seen
coming
bending
forward
upon
his
horse
,
belabouring
it
with
great
*NL*
blows
,
the
girths
dripping
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
recovered
consciousness
,
he
fell
,
weeping
,
into
Bovary
's
*NL*
arms
:
``
My
girl
!
Emma
!
my
child
!
tell
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
replied
,
sobbing
,
``
I
do
n't
know
!
I
do
n't
know
!
It
's
a
curse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
separated
them
.
``
These
horrible
details
are
useless
.
I
will
*NL*
tell
this
gentleman
all
about
it
.
Here
are
the
people
coming
.
Dignity
!
*NL*
Come
now
!
Philosophy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
tried
to
show
himself
brave
,
and
repeated
several
times
.
*NL*
``
Yes
!
courage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
the
old
man
,
``
so
I
will
have
,
by
God
!
I
'll
go
along
o
'
her
*NL*
to
the
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
began
tolling
.
All
was
ready
;
they
had
to
start
.
And
seated
in
*NL*
a
stall
of
the
choir
,
side
by
side
,
they
saw
pass
and
repass
in
front
of
*NL*
them
continually
the
three
chanting
choristers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serpent-player
was
blowing
with
all
his
might
.
Monsieur
Bournisien
,
*NL*
in
full
vestments
,
was
singing
in
a
shrill
voice
.
He
bowed
before
the
*NL*
tabernacle
,
raising
his
hands
,
stretched
out
his
arms
.
Lestiboudois
*NL*
went
about
the
church
with
his
whalebone
stick
.
The
bier
stood
near
the
*NL*
lectern
,
between
four
rows
of
candles
.
Charles
felt
inclined
to
get
up
*NL*
and
put
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
tried
to
stir
himself
to
a
feeling
of
devotion
,
to
throw
himself
*NL*
into
the
hope
of
a
future
life
in
which
he
should
see
her
again
.
He
*NL*
imagined
to
himself
she
had
gone
on
a
long
journey
,
far
away
,
for
a
long
*NL*
time
.
But
when
he
thought
of
her
lying
there
,
and
that
all
was
over
,
*NL*
that
they
would
lay
her
in
the
earth
,
he
was
seized
with
a
fierce
,
*NL*
gloomy
,
despairful
rage
.
At
times
he
thought
he
felt
nothing
more
,
and
*NL*
he
enjoyed
this
lull
in
his
pain
,
whilst
at
the
same
time
he
reproached
*NL*
himself
for
being
a
wretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sharp
noise
of
an
iron-ferruled
stick
was
heard
on
the
stones
,
*NL*
striking
them
at
irregular
intervals
.
It
came
from
the
end
of
the
*NL*
church
,
and
stopped
short
at
the
lower
aisles
.
A
man
in
a
coarse
brown
*NL*
jacket
knelt
down
painfully
.
It
was
Hippolyte
,
the
stable-boy
at
the
*NL*
``
Lion
d'Or
.
''
He
had
put
on
his
new
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
choristers
went
round
the
nave
making
a
collection
,
and
the
*NL*
coppers
chinked
one
after
the
other
on
the
silver
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
make
haste
!
I
am
in
pain
!
''
cried
Bovary
,
angrily
throwing
him
a
*NL*
five-franc
piece
.
The
churchman
thanked
him
with
a
deep
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sang
,
they
knelt
,
they
stood
up
;
it
was
endless
!
He
remembered
that
*NL*
once
,
in
the
early
times
,
they
had
been
to
mass
together
,
and
they
had
*NL*
sat
down
on
the
other
side
,
on
the
right
,
by
the
wall
.
The
bell
began
*NL*
again
.
There
was
a
great
moving
of
chairs
;
the
bearers
slipped
their
*NL*
three
staves
under
the
coffin
,
and
everyone
left
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Justin
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
shop
.
He
suddenly
went
in
again
,
*NL*
pale
,
staggering
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
were
at
the
windows
to
see
the
procession
pass
.
Charles
at
the
*NL*
head
walked
erect
.
He
affected
a
brave
air
,
and
saluted
with
a
nod
those
*NL*
who
,
coming
out
from
the
lanes
or
from
their
doors
,
stood
amidst
the
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
six
men
,
three
on
either
side
,
walked
slowly
,
panting
a
little
.
*NL*
The
priests
,
the
choristers
,
and
the
two
choirboys
recited
the
De
*NL*
profundis
*
,
and
their
voices
echoed
over
the
fields
,
rising
and
falling
*NL*
with
their
undulations
.
Sometimes
they
disappeared
in
the
windings
of
*NL*
the
path
;
but
the
great
silver
cross
rose
always
before
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Psalm
CXXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
followed
in
black
cloaks
with
turned-down
hoods
;
each
of
them
*NL*
carried
in
her
hands
a
large
lighted
candle
,
and
Charles
felt
himself
*NL*
growing
weaker
at
this
continual
repetition
of
prayers
and
torches
,
*NL*
beneath
this
oppressive
odour
of
wax
and
of
cassocks
.
A
fresh
breeze
was
*NL*
blowing
;
the
rye
and
colza
were
sprouting
,
little
dewdrops
trembled
at
*NL*
the
roadsides
and
on
the
hawthorn
hedges
.
All
sorts
of
joyous
sounds
*NL*
filled
the
air
;
the
jolting
of
a
cart
rolling
afar
off
in
the
ruts
,
the
*NL*
crowing
of
a
cock
,
repeated
again
and
again
,
or
the
gambling
of
a
foal
*NL*
running
away
under
the
apple-trees
:
The
pure
sky
was
fretted
with
rosy
*NL*
clouds
;
a
bluish
haze
rested
upon
the
cots
covered
with
iris
.
Charles
as
*NL*
he
passed
recognised
each
courtyard
.
He
remembered
mornings
like
this
,
*NL*
when
,
after
visiting
some
patient
,
he
came
out
from
one
and
returned
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
cloth
bestrewn
with
white
beads
blew
up
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
laying
bare
the
coffin
.
The
tired
bearers
walked
more
slowly
,
and
it
*NL*
advanced
with
constant
jerks
,
like
a
boat
that
pitches
with
every
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
cemetery
.
The
men
went
right
down
to
a
place
in
the
*NL*
grass
where
a
grave
was
dug
.
They
ranged
themselves
all
round
;
and
while
*NL*
the
priest
spoke
,
the
red
soil
thrown
up
at
the
sides
kept
noiselessly
*NL*
slipping
down
at
the
corners
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
when
the
four
ropes
were
arranged
the
coffin
was
placed
upon
them
.
*NL*
He
watched
it
descend
;
it
seemed
descending
for
ever
.
At
last
a
thud
was
*NL*
heard
;
the
ropes
creaked
as
they
were
drawn
up
.
Then
Bournisien
took
*NL*
the
spade
handed
to
him
by
Lestiboudois
;
with
his
left
hand
all
the
*NL*
time
sprinkling
water
,
with
the
right
he
vigorously
threw
in
a
large
*NL*
spadeful
;
and
the
wood
of
the
coffin
,
struck
by
the
pebbles
,
gave
forth
*NL*
that
dread
sound
that
seems
to
us
the
reverberation
of
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ecclesiastic
passed
the
holy
water
sprinkler
to
his
neighbour
.
This
*NL*
was
Homais
.
He
swung
it
gravely
,
then
handed
it
to
Charles
,
who
sank
to
*NL*
his
knees
in
the
earth
and
threw
in
handfuls
of
it
,
crying
,
``
Adieu
!
''
He
*NL*
sent
her
kisses
;
he
dragged
himself
towards
the
grave
,
to
engulf
himself
*NL*
with
her
.
They
led
him
away
,
and
he
soon
grew
calmer
,
feeling
perhaps
,
*NL*
like
the
others
,
a
vague
satisfaction
that
it
was
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Rouault
on
his
way
back
began
quietly
smoking
a
pipe
,
which
Homais
*NL*
in
his
innermost
conscience
thought
not
quite
the
thing
.
He
also
noticed
*NL*
that
Monsieur
Binet
had
not
been
present
,
and
that
Tuvache
had
``
made
*NL*
off
''
after
mass
,
and
that
Theodore
,
the
notary
's
servant
wore
a
blue
*NL*
coat
,
``
as
if
one
could
not
have
got
a
black
coat
,
since
that
is
the
*NL*
custom
,
by
Jove
!
''
And
to
share
his
observations
with
others
he
went
from
*NL*
group
to
group
.
They
were
deploring
Emma
's
death
,
especially
Lheureux
,
*NL*
who
had
not
failed
to
come
to
the
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
woman
!
What
a
trouble
for
her
husband
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
druggist
continued
,
``
Do
you
know
that
but
for
me
he
would
have
*NL*
committed
some
fatal
attempt
upon
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
good
woman
!
To
think
that
I
saw
her
only
last
Saturday
in
my
*NL*
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
had
leisure
,
''
said
Homais
,
``
to
prepare
a
few
words
that
I
*NL*
would
have
cast
upon
her
tomb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
on
getting
home
undressed
,
and
old
Rouault
put
on
his
blue
*NL*
blouse
.
It
was
a
new
one
,
and
as
he
had
often
during
the
journey
wiped
*NL*
his
eyes
on
the
sleeves
,
the
dye
had
stained
his
face
,
and
the
traces
of
*NL*
tears
made
lines
in
the
layer
of
dust
that
covered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Bovary
senior
was
with
them
.
All
three
were
silent
.
At
last
the
*NL*
old
fellow
sighed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
,
my
friend
,
that
I
went
to
Tostes
once
when
you
had
*NL*
just
lost
your
first
deceased
?
I
consoled
you
at
that
time
.
I
thought
of
*NL*
something
to
say
then
,
but
now
--
''
Then
,
with
a
loud
groan
that
shook
his
*NL*
whole
chest
,
``
Ah
!
this
is
the
end
for
me
,
do
you
see
!
I
saw
my
wife
go
,
*NL*
then
my
son
,
and
now
to-day
it
's
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
go
back
at
once
to
Bertaux
,
saying
that
he
could
not
sleep
*NL*
in
this
house
.
He
even
refused
to
see
his
granddaughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
It
would
grieve
me
too
much
.
Only
you
'll
kiss
her
many
times
*NL*
for
me
.
Good-bye
!
you
're
a
good
fellow
!
And
then
I
shall
never
forget
*NL*
that
,
''
he
said
,
slapping
his
thigh
.
``
Never
fear
,
you
shall
always
have
*NL*
your
turkey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
he
turned
back
,
as
he
had
turned
*NL*
once
before
on
the
road
of
Saint-Victor
when
he
had
parted
from
her
.
The
*NL*
windows
of
the
village
were
all
on
fire
beneath
the
slanting
rays
of
the
*NL*
sun
sinking
behind
the
field
.
He
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
and
saw
*NL*
in
the
horizon
an
enclosure
of
walls
,
where
trees
here
and
there
formed
*NL*
black
clusters
between
white
stones
;
then
he
went
on
his
way
at
a
gentle
*NL*
trot
,
for
his
nag
had
gone
lame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
their
fatigue
,
Charles
and
his
mother
stayed
very
long
that
*NL*
evening
talking
together
.
They
spoke
of
the
days
of
the
past
and
of
the
*NL*
future
.
She
would
come
to
live
at
Yonville
;
she
would
keep
house
for
*NL*
him
;
they
would
never
part
again
.
She
was
ingenious
and
caressing
,
*NL*
rejoicing
in
her
heart
at
gaining
once
more
an
affection
that
had
*NL*
wandered
from
her
for
so
many
years
.
Midnight
struck
.
The
village
as
*NL*
usual
was
silent
,
and
Charles
,
awake
,
thought
always
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
who
,
to
distract
himself
,
had
been
rambling
about
the
wood
all
*NL*
day
,
was
sleeping
quietly
in
his
chateau
,
and
Leon
,
down
yonder
,
always
*NL*
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
who
at
that
hour
was
not
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
grave
between
the
pine-trees
a
child
was
on
his
knees
weeping
,
*NL*
and
his
heart
,
rent
by
sobs
,
was
beating
in
the
shadow
beneath
the
load
*NL*
of
an
immense
regret
,
sweeter
than
the
moon
and
fathomless
as
the
night
.
*NL*
The
gate
suddenly
grated
.
It
was
Lestiboudois
;
he
came
to
fetch
his
*NL*
spade
,
that
he
had
forgotten
.
He
recognised
Justin
climbing
over
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
at
last
knew
who
was
the
culprit
who
stole
his
potatoes
.

Chapter
Eleven
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Charles
had
the
child
brought
back
.
She
asked
for
her
*NL*
mamma
.
They
told
her
she
was
away
;
that
she
would
bring
her
back
some
*NL*
playthings
.
Berthe
spoke
of
her
again
several
times
,
then
at
last
*NL*
thought
no
more
of
her
.
The
child
's
gaiety
broke
Bovary
's
heart
,
and
he
*NL*
had
to
bear
besides
the
intolerable
consolations
of
the
chemist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Money
troubles
soon
began
again
,
Monsieur
Lheureux
urging
on
anew
his
*NL*
friend
Vincart
,
and
Charles
pledged
himself
for
exorbitant
sums
;
for
he
*NL*
would
never
consent
to
let
the
smallest
of
the
things
that
had
belonged
*NL*
to
HER
be
sold
.
His
mother
was
exasperated
with
him
;
he
grew
even
more
*NL*
angry
than
she
did
.
He
had
altogether
changed
.
She
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
everyone
began
``
taking
advantage
''
of
him
.
Mademoiselle
Lempereur
*NL*
presented
a
bill
for
six
months
'
teaching
,
although
Emma
had
never
taken
*NL*
a
lesson
-LRB-
despite
the
receipted
bill
she
had
shown
Bovary
-RRB-
;
it
was
an
*NL*
arrangement
between
the
two
women
.
The
man
at
the
circulating
library
*NL*
demanded
three
years
'
subscriptions
;
Mere
Rollet
claimed
the
postage
due
*NL*
for
some
twenty
letters
,
and
when
Charles
asked
for
an
explanation
,
she
*NL*
had
the
delicacy
to
reply
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
It
was
for
her
business
affairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
every
debt
he
paid
Charles
thought
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
them
.
*NL*
But
others
followed
ceaselessly
.
He
sent
in
accounts
for
professional
*NL*
attendance
.
He
was
shown
the
letters
his
wife
had
written
.
Then
he
had
*NL*
to
apologise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felicite
now
wore
Madame
Bovary
's
gowns
;
not
all
,
for
he
had
kept
some
*NL*
of
them
,
and
he
went
to
look
at
them
in
her
dressing-room
,
locking
*NL*
himself
up
there
;
she
was
about
her
height
,
and
often
Charles
,
seeing
*NL*
her
from
behind
,
was
seized
with
an
illusion
,
and
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
stay
,
stay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
Whitsuntide
she
ran
away
from
Yonville
,
carried
off
by
Theodore
,
*NL*
stealing
all
that
was
left
of
the
wardrobe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
that
the
widow
Dupuis
had
the
honour
to
inform
*NL*
him
of
the
``
marriage
of
Monsieur
Leon
Dupuis
her
son
,
notary
at
Yvetot
,
*NL*
to
Mademoiselle
Leocadie
Leboeuf
of
Bondeville
.
''
Charles
,
among
the
*NL*
other
congratulations
he
sent
him
,
wrote
this
sentence
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
my
poor
wife
would
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
,
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
house
,
he
had
gone
up
to
the
*NL*
attic
,
he
felt
a
pellet
of
fine
paper
under
his
slipper
.
He
opened
it
*NL*
and
read
:
``
Courage
,
Emma
,
courage
.
I
would
not
bring
misery
into
your
*NL*
life
.
''
It
was
Rodolphe
's
letter
,
fallen
to
the
ground
between
the
boxes
,
*NL*
where
it
had
remained
,
and
that
the
wind
from
the
dormer
window
had
just
*NL*
blown
towards
the
door
.
And
Charles
stood
,
motionless
and
staring
,
in
*NL*
the
very
same
place
where
,
long
ago
,
Emma
,
in
despair
,
and
paler
even
*NL*
than
he
,
had
thought
of
dying
.
At
last
he
discovered
a
small
R
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
second
page
.
What
did
this
mean
?
He
remembered
Rodolphe
's
*NL*
attentions
,
his
sudden
,
disappearance
,
his
constrained
air
when
they
*NL*
had
met
two
or
three
times
since
.
But
the
respectful
tone
of
the
letter
*NL*
deceived
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
loved
one
another
platonically
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
Charles
was
not
of
those
who
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
;
he
*NL*
shrank
from
the
proofs
,
and
his
vague
jealousy
was
lost
in
the
immensity
*NL*
of
his
woe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
,
he
thought
,
must
have
adored
her
;
all
men
assuredly
must
have
*NL*
coveted
her
.
She
seemed
but
the
more
beautiful
to
him
for
this
;
he
*NL*
was
seized
with
a
lasting
,
furious
desire
for
her
,
that
inflamed
his
*NL*
despair
,
and
that
was
boundless
,
because
it
was
now
unrealisable
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
please
her
,
as
if
she
were
still
living
,
he
adopted
her
*NL*
predilections
,
her
ideas
;
he
bought
patent
leather
boots
and
took
to
*NL*
wearing
white
cravats
.
He
put
cosmetics
on
his
moustache
,
and
,
like
her
,
*NL*
signed
notes
of
hand
.
She
corrupted
him
from
beyond
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
obliged
to
sell
his
silver
piece
by
piece
;
next
he
sold
the
*NL*
drawing-room
furniture
.
All
the
rooms
were
stripped
;
but
the
bedroom
,
*NL*
her
own
room
,
remained
as
before
.
After
his
dinner
Charles
went
up
*NL*
there
.
He
pushed
the
round
table
in
front
of
the
fire
,
and
drew
up
her
*NL*
armchair
.
He
sat
down
opposite
it
.
A
candle
burnt
in
one
of
the
gilt
*NL*
candlesticks
.
Berthe
by
his
side
was
painting
prints
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suffered
,
poor
man
,
at
seeing
her
so
badly
dressed
,
with
laceless
*NL*
boots
,
and
the
arm-holes
of
her
pinafore
torn
down
to
the
hips
;
for
the
*NL*
charwoman
took
no
care
of
her
.
But
she
was
so
sweet
,
so
pretty
,
and
her
*NL*
little
head
bent
forward
so
gracefully
,
letting
the
dear
fair
hair
fall
*NL*
over
her
rosy
cheeks
,
that
an
infinite
joy
came
upon
him
,
a
happiness
*NL*
mingled
with
bitterness
,
like
those
ill-made
wines
that
taste
of
*NL*
resin
.
He
mended
her
toys
,
made
her
puppets
from
cardboard
,
or
sewed
up
*NL*
half-torn
dolls
.
Then
,
if
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
workbox
,
a
ribbon
lying
*NL*
about
,
or
even
a
pin
left
in
a
crack
of
the
table
,
he
began
to
dream
,
*NL*
and
looked
so
sad
that
she
became
as
sad
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
now
came
to
see
them
,
for
Justin
had
run
away
to
Rouen
,
where
he
*NL*
was
a
grocer
's
assistant
,
and
the
druggist
's
children
saw
less
and
less
*NL*
of
the
child
,
Monsieur
Homais
not
caring
,
seeing
the
difference
of
their
*NL*
social
position
,
to
continue
the
intimacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
man
,
whom
he
had
not
been
able
to
cure
with
the
pomade
,
had
*NL*
gone
back
to
the
hill
of
Bois-Guillaume
,
where
he
told
the
travellers
of
*NL*
the
vain
attempt
of
the
druggist
,
to
such
an
extent
,
that
Homais
when
*NL*
he
went
to
town
hid
himself
behind
the
curtains
of
the
``
Hirondelle
''
to
*NL*
avoid
meeting
him
.
He
detested
him
,
and
wishing
,
in
the
interests
of
his
*NL*
own
reputation
,
to
get
rid
of
him
at
all
costs
,
he
directed
against
*NL*
him
a
secret
battery
,
that
betrayed
the
depth
of
his
intellect
and
the
*NL*
baseness
of
his
vanity
.
Thus
,
for
six
consecutive
months
,
one
could
read
*NL*
in
the
``
Fanal
de
Rouen
''
editorials
such
as
these
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
who
bend
their
steps
towards
the
fertile
plains
of
Picardy
have
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
remarked
,
by
the
Bois-Guillaume
hill
,
a
wretch
suffering
from
*NL*
a
horrible
facial
wound
.
He
importunes
,
persecutes
one
,
and
levies
a
*NL*
regular
tax
on
all
travellers
.
Are
we
still
living
in
the
monstrous
*NL*
times
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
when
vagabonds
were
permitted
to
display
in
*NL*
our
public
places
leprosy
and
scrofulas
they
had
brought
back
from
the
*NL*
Crusades
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Or
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
spite
of
the
laws
against
vagabondage
,
the
approaches
to
our
great
*NL*
towns
continue
to
be
infected
by
bands
of
beggars
.
Some
are
seen
going
*NL*
about
alone
,
and
these
are
not
,
perhaps
,
the
least
dangerous
.
What
are
*NL*
our
ediles
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Homais
invented
anecdotes
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
,
by
the
Bois-Guillaume
hill
,
a
skittish
horse
--
''
And
then
*NL*
followed
the
story
of
an
accident
caused
by
the
presence
of
the
blind
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
managed
so
well
that
the
fellow
was
locked
up
.
But
he
was
released
.
*NL*
He
began
again
,
and
Homais
began
again
.
It
was
a
struggle
.
Homais
won
*NL*
it
,
for
his
foe
was
condemned
to
life-long
confinement
in
an
asylum
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
success
emboldened
him
,
and
henceforth
there
was
no
longer
a
dog
*NL*
run
over
,
a
barn
burnt
down
,
a
woman
beaten
in
the
parish
,
of
which
*NL*
he
did
not
immediately
inform
the
public
,
guided
always
by
the
love
of
*NL*
progress
and
the
hate
of
priests
.
He
instituted
comparisons
between
the
*NL*
elementary
and
clerical
schools
to
the
detriment
of
the
latter
;
called
*NL*
to
mind
the
massacre
of
St.
Bartholomew
a
propos
of
a
grant
of
one
*NL*
hundred
francs
to
the
church
,
and
denounced
abuses
,
aired
new
views
.
*NL*
That
was
his
phrase
.
Homais
was
digging
and
delving
;
he
was
becoming
*NL*
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
was
stifling
in
the
narrow
limits
of
journalism
,
and
soon
a
*NL*
book
,
a
work
was
necessary
to
him
.
Then
he
composed
``
General
Statistics
*NL*
of
the
Canton
of
Yonville
,
followed
by
Climatological
Remarks
.
''
The
*NL*
statistics
drove
him
to
philosophy
.
He
busied
himself
with
great
*NL*
questions
:
the
social
problem
,
moralisation
of
the
poorer
classes
,
*NL*
pisciculture
,
caoutchouc
,
railways
,
etc.
.
He
even
began
to
blush
at
being
*NL*
a
bourgeois
.
He
affected
the
artistic
style
,
he
smoked
.
He
bought
two
*NL*
chic
Pompadour
statuettes
to
adorn
his
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
by
no
means
gave
up
his
shop
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
kept
well
abreast
*NL*
of
new
discoveries
.
He
followed
the
great
movement
of
chocolates
;
he
*NL*
was
the
first
to
introduce
``
cocoa
''
and
``
revalenta
''
into
the
*NL*
Seine-Inferieure
.
He
was
enthusiastic
about
the
hydro-electric
*NL*
Pulvermacher
chains
;
he
wore
one
himself
,
and
when
at
night
he
took
off
*NL*
his
flannel
vest
,
Madame
Homais
stood
quite
dazzled
before
the
golden
*NL*
spiral
beneath
which
he
was
hidden
,
and
felt
her
ardour
redouble
for
*NL*
this
man
more
bandaged
than
a
Scythian
,
and
splendid
as
one
of
the
Magi
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fine
ideas
about
Emma
's
tomb
.
First
he
proposed
a
broken
column
*NL*
with
some
drapery
,
next
a
pyramid
,
then
a
Temple
of
Vesta
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
rotunda
,
or
else
a
``
mass
of
ruins
.
''
And
in
all
his
plans
Homais
always
*NL*
stuck
to
the
weeping
willow
,
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
indispensable
*NL*
symbol
of
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
he
made
a
journey
to
Rouen
together
to
look
at
some
tombs
*NL*
at
a
funeral
furnisher
's
,
accompanied
by
an
artist
,
one
Vaufrylard
,
a
*NL*
friend
of
Bridoux
's
,
who
made
puns
all
the
time
.
At
last
,
after
having
*NL*
examined
some
hundred
designs
,
having
ordered
an
estimate
and
made
*NL*
another
journey
to
Rouen
,
Charles
decided
in
favour
of
a
mausoleum
,
*NL*
which
on
the
two
principal
sides
was
to
have
a
``
spirit
bearing
an
*NL*
extinguished
torch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
inscription
,
Homais
could
think
of
nothing
so
fine
as
Sta
*NL*
viator
*
,
and
he
got
no
further
;
he
racked
his
brain
,
he
constantly
*NL*
repeated
Sta
viator
.
At
last
he
hit
upon
Amabilen
conjugem
calcas
**
,
*NL*
which
was
adopted
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Rest
traveler
.
*NL*
*NL*
**
Tread
upon
a
loving
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
thing
was
that
Bovary
,
while
continually
thinking
of
Emma
,
was
*NL*
forgetting
her
.
He
grew
desperate
as
he
felt
this
image
fading
from
his
*NL*
memory
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
retain
it
.
Yet
every
night
he
dreamt
*NL*
of
her
;
it
was
always
the
same
dream
.
He
drew
near
her
,
but
when
he
was
*NL*
about
to
clasp
her
she
fell
into
decay
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
he
was
seen
going
to
church
in
the
evening
.
Monsieur
*NL*
Bournisien
even
paid
him
two
or
three
visits
,
then
gave
him
up
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
old
fellow
was
growing
intolerant
,
fanatic
,
said
Homais
.
*NL*
He
thundered
against
the
spirit
of
the
age
,
and
never
failed
,
every
*NL*
other
week
,
in
his
sermon
,
to
recount
the
death
agony
of
Voltaire
,
who
*NL*
died
devouring
his
excrements
,
as
everyone
knows
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
economy
with
which
Bovary
lived
,
he
was
far
from
being
*NL*
able
to
pay
off
his
old
debts
.
Lheureux
refused
to
renew
any
more
*NL*
bills
.
A
distraint
became
imminent
.
Then
he
appealed
to
his
mother
,
who
*NL*
consented
to
let
him
take
a
mortgage
on
her
property
,
but
with
a
great
*NL*
many
recriminations
against
Emma
;
and
in
return
for
her
sacrifice
she
*NL*
asked
for
a
shawl
that
had
escaped
the
depredations
of
Felicite
.
Charles
*NL*
refused
to
give
it
her
;
they
quarrelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
the
first
overtures
of
reconciliation
by
offering
to
have
the
*NL*
little
girl
,
who
could
help
her
in
the
house
,
to
live
with
her
.
Charles
*NL*
consented
to
this
,
but
when
the
time
for
parting
came
,
all
his
courage
*NL*
failed
him
.
Then
there
was
a
final
,
complete
rupture
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
affections
vanished
,
he
clung
more
closely
to
the
love
of
his
*NL*
child
.
She
made
him
anxious
,
however
,
for
she
coughed
sometimes
,
and
had
*NL*
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
his
house
,
flourishing
and
merry
,
was
the
family
of
the
*NL*
chemist
,
with
whom
everything
was
prospering
.
Napoleon
helped
him
in
the
*NL*
laboratory
,
Athalie
embroidered
him
a
skullcap
,
Irma
cut
out
rounds
of
*NL*
paper
to
cover
the
preserves
,
and
Franklin
recited
Pythagoras
'
table
in
*NL*
a
breath
.
He
was
the
happiest
of
fathers
,
the
most
fortunate
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
!
A
secret
ambition
devoured
him
.
Homais
hankered
after
the
cross
*NL*
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
.
He
had
plenty
of
claims
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
having
at
the
time
of
the
cholera
distinguished
myself
by
a
*NL*
boundless
devotion
;
second
,
by
having
published
,
at
my
expense
,
*NL*
various
works
of
public
utility
,
such
as
''
-LRB-
and
he
recalled
his
pamphlet
*NL*
entitled
,
``
Cider
,
its
manufacture
and
effects
,
''
besides
observation
*NL*
on
the
lanigerous
plant-louse
,
sent
to
the
Academy
;
his
volume
of
*NL*
statistics
,
and
down
to
his
pharmaceutical
thesis
-RRB-
;
``
without
counting
*NL*
that
I
am
a
member
of
several
learned
societies
''
-LRB-
he
was
member
of
a
*NL*
single
one
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
!
''
he
cried
,
making
a
pirouette
,
``
if
it
were
only
for
*NL*
distinguishing
myself
at
fires
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Homais
inclined
towards
the
Government
.
He
secretly
did
the
*NL*
prefect
great
service
during
the
elections
.
He
sold
himself
--
in
a
word
,
*NL*
prostituted
himself
.
He
even
addressed
a
petition
to
the
sovereign
*NL*
in
which
he
implored
him
to
``
do
him
justice
''
;
he
called
him
``
our
good
*NL*
king
,
''
and
compared
him
to
Henri
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
every
morning
the
druggist
rushed
for
the
paper
to
see
if
his
*NL*
nomination
were
in
it
.
It
was
never
there
.
At
last
,
unable
to
bear
it
*NL*
any
longer
,
he
had
a
grass
plot
in
his
garden
designed
to
represent
the
*NL*
Star
of
the
Cross
of
Honour
with
two
little
strips
of
grass
running
from
*NL*
the
top
to
imitate
the
ribband
.
He
walked
round
it
with
folded
arms
,
*NL*
meditating
on
the
folly
of
the
Government
and
the
ingratitude
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
respect
,
or
from
a
sort
of
sensuality
that
made
him
carry
on
his
*NL*
investigations
slowly
,
Charles
had
not
yet
opened
the
secret
drawer
of
*NL*
a
rosewood
desk
which
Emma
had
generally
used
.
One
day
,
however
,
he
*NL*
sat
down
before
it
,
turned
the
key
,
and
pressed
the
spring
.
All
Leon
's
*NL*
letters
were
there
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
this
time
.
He
devoured
them
*NL*
to
the
very
last
,
ransacked
every
corner
,
all
the
furniture
,
all
the
*NL*
drawers
,
behind
the
walls
,
sobbing
,
crying
aloud
,
distraught
,
mad
.
He
*NL*
found
a
box
and
broke
it
open
with
a
kick
.
Rodolphe
's
portrait
flew
full
*NL*
in
his
face
in
the
midst
of
the
overturned
love-letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
wondered
at
his
despondency
.
He
never
went
out
,
saw
no
one
,
*NL*
refused
even
to
visit
his
patients
.
Then
they
said
``
he
shut
himself
up
*NL*
to
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
however
,
some
curious
person
climbed
on
to
the
garden
hedge
,
*NL*
and
saw
with
amazement
this
long-bearded
,
shabbily
clothed
,
wild
man
,
*NL*
who
wept
aloud
as
he
walked
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
in
summer
he
took
his
little
girl
with
him
and
led
her
to
*NL*
the
cemetery
.
They
came
back
at
nightfall
,
when
the
only
light
left
in
*NL*
the
Place
was
that
in
Binet
's
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voluptuousness
of
his
grief
was
,
however
,
incomplete
,
for
he
had
no
*NL*
one
near
him
to
share
it
,
and
he
paid
visits
to
Madame
Lefrancois
to
be
*NL*
able
to
speak
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
landlady
only
listened
with
half
an
ear
,
having
troubles
*NL*
like
himself
.
For
Lheureux
had
at
last
established
the
``
Favorites
du
*NL*
Commerce
,
''
and
Hivert
,
who
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
for
doing
errands
,
*NL*
insisted
on
a
rise
of
wages
,
and
was
threatening
to
go
over
``
to
the
*NL*
opposition
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
he
had
gone
to
the
market
at
Argueil
to
sell
his
horse
--
his
*NL*
last
resource
--
he
met
Rodolphe
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
turned
pale
when
they
caught
sight
of
one
another
.
Rodolphe
,
*NL*
who
had
only
sent
his
card
,
first
stammered
some
apologies
,
then
grew
*NL*
bolder
,
and
even
pushed
his
assurance
-LRB-
it
was
in
the
month
of
August
and
*NL*
very
hot
-RRB-
to
the
length
of
inviting
him
to
have
a
bottle
of
beer
at
the
*NL*
public-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaning
on
the
table
opposite
him
,
he
chewed
his
cigar
as
he
talked
,
and
*NL*
Charles
was
lost
in
reverie
at
this
face
that
she
had
loved
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
see
again
something
of
her
in
it
.
It
was
a
marvel
to
him
.
He
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
have
been
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
went
on
talking
agriculture
,
cattle
,
pasturage
,
filling
out
*NL*
with
banal
phrases
all
the
gaps
where
an
allusion
might
slip
in
.
Charles
*NL*
was
not
listening
to
him
;
Rodolphe
noticed
it
,
and
he
followed
the
*NL*
succession
of
memories
that
crossed
his
face
.
This
gradually
grew
*NL*
redder
;
the
nostrils
throbbed
fast
,
the
lips
quivered
.
There
was
at
*NL*
last
a
moment
when
Charles
,
full
of
a
sombre
fury
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
who
,
in
something
of
fear
,
stopped
talking
.
But
soon
the
same
*NL*
look
of
weary
lassitude
came
back
to
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
blame
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
was
dumb
.
And
Charles
,
his
head
in
his
hands
,
went
on
in
a
*NL*
broken
voice
,
and
with
the
resigned
accent
of
infinite
sorrow
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
blame
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
even
added
a
fine
phrase
,
the
only
one
he
ever
made
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
fault
of
fatality
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rodolphe
,
who
had
managed
the
fatality
,
thought
the
remark
very
offhand
*NL*
from
a
man
in
his
position
,
comic
even
,
and
a
little
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Charles
went
to
sit
down
on
the
seat
in
the
arbour
.
Rays
*NL*
of
light
were
straying
through
the
trellis
,
the
vine
leaves
threw
their
*NL*
shadows
on
the
sand
,
the
jasmines
perfumed
the
air
,
the
heavens
were
*NL*
blue
,
Spanish
flies
buzzed
round
the
lilies
in
bloom
,
and
Charles
was
*NL*
suffocating
like
a
youth
beneath
the
vague
love
influences
that
filled
*NL*
his
aching
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
little
Berthe
,
who
had
not
seen
him
all
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
went
to
fetch
him
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
was
thrown
back
against
the
wall
,
his
eyes
closed
,
his
mouth
*NL*
open
,
and
in
his
hand
was
a
long
tress
of
black
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
papa
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thinking
he
wanted
to
play
;
she
pushed
him
gently
.
He
fell
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
He
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirty-six
hours
after
,
at
the
druggist
's
request
,
Monsieur
Canivet
came
*NL*
thither
.
He
made
a
post-mortem
and
found
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
everything
had
been
sold
,
twelve
francs
seventy-five
centimes
*NL*
remained
,
that
served
to
pay
for
Mademoiselle
Bovary
's
going
to
*NL*
her
grandmother
.
The
good
woman
died
the
same
year
;
old
Rouault
was
*NL*
paralysed
,
and
it
was
an
aunt
who
took
charge
of
her
.
She
is
poor
,
and
*NL*
sends
her
to
a
cotton-factory
to
earn
a
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Bovary
's
death
three
doctors
have
followed
one
another
at
Yonville
*NL*
without
any
success
,
so
severely
did
Homais
attack
them
.
He
has
an
*NL*
enormous
practice
;
the
authorities
treat
him
with
consideration
,
and
*NL*
public
opinion
protects
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
just
received
the
cross
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
.
