The
History
Of
A
Family
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
Karamazov
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
was
the
third
son
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
Karamazov
,
a
land
owner
well
known
in
our
district
in
his
own
day
,
and
*NL*
still
remembered
among
us
owing
to
his
gloomy
and
tragic
death
,
which
*NL*
happened
thirteen
years
ago
,
and
which
I
shall
describe
in
its
proper
*NL*
place
.
For
the
present
I
will
only
say
that
this
``
landowner
''
--
for
so
we
*NL*
used
to
call
him
,
although
he
hardly
spent
a
day
of
his
life
on
his
own
*NL*
estate
--
was
a
strange
type
,
yet
one
pretty
frequently
to
be
met
with
,
a
*NL*
type
abject
and
vicious
and
at
the
same
time
senseless
.
But
he
was
one
of
*NL*
those
senseless
persons
who
are
very
well
capable
of
looking
after
their
*NL*
worldly
affairs
,
and
,
apparently
,
after
nothing
else
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
began
with
next
to
nothing
;
his
estate
was
of
the
smallest
;
*NL*
he
ran
to
dine
at
other
men
's
tables
,
and
fastened
on
them
as
a
toady
,
yet
*NL*
at
his
death
it
appeared
that
he
had
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
in
hard
*NL*
cash
.
At
the
same
time
,
he
was
all
his
life
one
of
the
most
senseless
,
*NL*
fantastical
fellows
in
the
whole
district
.
I
repeat
,
it
was
not
*NL*
stupidity
--
the
majority
of
these
fantastical
fellows
are
shrewd
and
*NL*
intelligent
enough
--
but
just
senselessness
,
and
a
peculiar
national
form
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
married
twice
,
and
had
three
sons
,
the
eldest
,
Dmitri
,
by
his
first
*NL*
wife
,
and
two
,
Ivan
and
Alexey
,
by
his
second
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
first
*NL*
wife
,
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
belonged
to
a
fairly
rich
and
distinguished
noble
*NL*
family
,
also
landowners
in
our
district
,
the
Miuesovs
.
How
it
came
to
pass
*NL*
that
an
heiress
,
who
was
also
a
beauty
,
and
moreover
one
of
those
*NL*
vigorous
,
intelligent
girls
,
so
common
in
this
generation
,
but
sometimes
*NL*
also
to
be
found
in
the
last
,
could
have
married
such
a
worthless
,
puny
*NL*
weakling
,
as
we
all
called
him
,
I
wo
n't
attempt
to
explain
.
I
knew
a
young
*NL*
lady
of
the
last
``
romantic
''
generation
who
after
some
years
of
an
*NL*
enigmatic
passion
for
a
gentleman
,
whom
she
might
quite
easily
have
*NL*
married
at
any
moment
,
invented
insuperable
obstacles
to
their
union
,
and
*NL*
ended
by
throwing
herself
one
stormy
night
into
a
rather
deep
and
rapid
*NL*
river
from
a
high
bank
,
almost
a
precipice
,
and
so
perished
,
entirely
to
*NL*
satisfy
her
own
caprice
,
and
to
be
like
Shakespeare
's
Ophelia
.
Indeed
,
if
*NL*
this
precipice
,
a
chosen
and
favorite
spot
of
hers
,
had
been
less
*NL*
picturesque
,
if
there
had
been
a
prosaic
flat
bank
in
its
place
,
most
*NL*
likely
the
suicide
would
never
have
taken
place
.
This
is
a
fact
,
and
*NL*
probably
there
have
been
not
a
few
similar
instances
in
the
last
two
or
*NL*
three
generations
.
Adelaida
Ivanovna
Miuesov
's
action
was
similarly
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
an
echo
of
other
people
's
ideas
,
and
was
due
to
the
irritation
*NL*
caused
by
lack
of
mental
freedom
.
She
wanted
,
perhaps
,
to
show
her
*NL*
feminine
independence
,
to
override
class
distinctions
and
the
despotism
of
*NL*
her
family
.
And
a
pliable
imagination
persuaded
her
,
we
must
suppose
,
for
*NL*
a
brief
moment
,
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
in
spite
of
his
parasitic
*NL*
position
,
was
one
of
the
bold
and
ironical
spirits
of
that
progressive
*NL*
epoch
,
though
he
was
,
in
fact
,
an
ill-natured
buffoon
and
nothing
more
.
*NL*
What
gave
the
marriage
piquancy
was
that
it
was
preceded
by
an
elopement
,
*NL*
and
this
greatly
captivated
Adelaida
Ivanovna
's
fancy
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
position
at
the
time
made
him
specially
eager
for
any
such
enterprise
,
for
*NL*
he
was
passionately
anxious
to
make
a
career
in
one
way
or
another
.
To
*NL*
attach
himself
to
a
good
family
and
obtain
a
dowry
was
an
alluring
*NL*
prospect
.
As
for
mutual
love
it
did
not
exist
apparently
,
either
in
the
*NL*
bride
or
in
him
,
in
spite
of
Adelaida
Ivanovna
's
beauty
.
This
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
a
unique
case
of
the
kind
in
the
life
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
*NL*
was
always
of
a
voluptuous
temper
,
and
ready
to
run
after
any
petticoat
on
*NL*
the
slightest
encouragement
.
She
seems
to
have
been
the
only
woman
who
*NL*
made
no
particular
appeal
to
his
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
the
elopement
Adelaida
Ivanovna
discerned
in
a
flash
*NL*
that
she
had
no
feeling
for
her
husband
but
contempt
.
The
marriage
*NL*
accordingly
showed
itself
in
its
true
colors
with
extraordinary
rapidity
.
*NL*
Although
the
family
accepted
the
event
pretty
quickly
and
apportioned
the
*NL*
runaway
bride
her
dowry
,
the
husband
and
wife
began
to
lead
a
most
*NL*
disorderly
life
,
and
there
were
everlasting
scenes
between
them
.
It
was
*NL*
said
that
the
young
wife
showed
incomparably
more
generosity
and
dignity
*NL*
than
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
,
as
is
now
known
,
got
hold
of
all
her
money
up
*NL*
to
twenty-five
thousand
roubles
as
soon
as
she
received
it
,
so
that
those
*NL*
thousands
were
lost
to
her
for
ever
.
The
little
village
and
the
rather
*NL*
fine
town
house
which
formed
part
of
her
dowry
he
did
his
utmost
for
a
*NL*
long
time
to
transfer
to
his
name
,
by
means
of
some
deed
of
conveyance
.
He
*NL*
would
probably
have
succeeded
,
merely
from
her
moral
fatigue
and
desire
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
him
,
and
from
the
contempt
and
loathing
he
aroused
by
his
*NL*
persistent
and
shameless
importunity
.
But
,
fortunately
,
Adelaida
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
family
intervened
and
circumvented
his
greediness
.
It
is
known
*NL*
for
a
fact
that
frequent
fights
took
place
between
the
husband
and
wife
,
*NL*
but
rumor
had
it
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
did
not
beat
his
wife
but
was
*NL*
beaten
by
her
,
for
she
was
a
hot-tempered
,
bold
,
dark-browed
,
impatient
*NL*
woman
,
possessed
of
remarkable
physical
strength
.
Finally
,
she
left
the
*NL*
house
and
ran
away
from
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
with
a
destitute
divinity
*NL*
student
,
leaving
Mitya
,
a
child
of
three
years
old
,
in
her
husband
's
*NL*
hands
.
Immediately
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
introduced
a
regular
harem
into
the
*NL*
house
,
and
abandoned
himself
to
orgies
of
drunkenness
.
In
the
intervals
he
*NL*
used
to
drive
all
over
the
province
,
complaining
tearfully
to
each
and
all
*NL*
of
Adelaida
Ivanovna
's
having
left
him
,
going
into
details
too
disgraceful
*NL*
for
a
husband
to
mention
in
regard
to
his
own
married
life
.
What
seemed
to
*NL*
gratify
him
and
flatter
his
self-love
most
was
to
play
the
ridiculous
part
*NL*
of
the
injured
husband
,
and
to
parade
his
woes
with
embellishments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
think
that
you
'd
got
a
promotion
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
you
seem
*NL*
so
pleased
in
spite
of
your
sorrow
,
''
scoffers
said
to
him
.
Many
even
added
*NL*
that
he
was
glad
of
a
new
comic
part
in
which
to
play
the
buffoon
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
simply
to
make
it
funnier
that
he
pretended
to
be
unaware
of
*NL*
his
ludicrous
position
.
But
,
who
knows
,
it
may
have
been
simplicity
.
At
*NL*
last
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
the
track
of
his
runaway
wife
.
The
poor
*NL*
woman
turned
out
to
be
in
Petersburg
,
where
she
had
gone
with
her
divinity
*NL*
student
,
and
where
she
had
thrown
herself
into
a
life
of
complete
*NL*
emancipation
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
at
once
began
bustling
about
,
making
*NL*
preparations
to
go
to
Petersburg
,
with
what
object
he
could
not
himself
*NL*
have
said
.
He
would
perhaps
have
really
gone
;
but
having
determined
to
do
*NL*
so
he
felt
at
once
entitled
to
fortify
himself
for
the
journey
by
another
*NL*
bout
of
reckless
drinking
.
And
just
at
that
time
his
wife
's
family
*NL*
received
the
news
of
her
death
in
Petersburg
.
She
had
died
quite
suddenly
*NL*
in
a
garret
,
according
to
one
story
,
of
typhus
,
or
as
another
version
had
*NL*
it
,
of
starvation
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
drunk
when
he
heard
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
death
,
and
the
story
is
that
he
ran
out
into
the
street
and
began
shouting
*NL*
with
joy
,
raising
his
hands
to
Heaven
:
``
Lord
,
now
lettest
Thou
Thy
servant
*NL*
depart
in
peace
,
''
but
others
say
he
wept
without
restraint
like
a
little
*NL*
child
,
so
much
so
that
people
were
sorry
for
him
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
repulsion
he
inspired
.
It
is
quite
possible
that
both
versions
were
true
,
*NL*
that
he
rejoiced
at
his
release
,
and
at
the
same
time
wept
for
her
who
*NL*
released
him
.
As
a
general
rule
,
people
,
even
the
wicked
,
are
much
more
*NL*
naive
and
simple-hearted
than
we
suppose
.
And
we
ourselves
are
,
too
.

Chapter
II
.
He
Gets
Rid
Of
His
Eldest
Son
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
You
can
easily
imagine
what
a
father
such
a
man
could
be
and
how
he
would
*NL*
bring
up
his
children
.
His
behavior
as
a
father
was
exactly
what
might
be
*NL*
expected
.
He
completely
abandoned
the
child
of
his
marriage
with
Adelaida
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
not
from
malice
,
nor
because
of
his
matrimonial
grievances
,
but
*NL*
simply
because
he
forgot
him
.
While
he
was
wearying
every
one
with
his
*NL*
tears
and
complaints
,
and
turning
his
house
into
a
sink
of
debauchery
,
a
*NL*
faithful
servant
of
the
family
,
Grigory
,
took
the
three-year-old
Mitya
*NL*
into
his
care
.
If
he
had
n't
looked
after
him
there
would
have
been
no
one
*NL*
even
to
change
the
baby
's
little
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
moreover
that
the
child
's
relations
on
his
mother
's
side
*NL*
forgot
him
too
at
first
.
His
grandfather
was
no
longer
living
,
his
widow
,
*NL*
Mitya
's
grandmother
,
had
moved
to
Moscow
,
and
was
seriously
ill
,
while
his
*NL*
daughters
were
married
,
so
that
Mitya
remained
for
almost
a
whole
year
in
*NL*
old
Grigory
's
charge
and
lived
with
him
in
the
servant
's
cottage
.
But
if
*NL*
his
father
had
remembered
him
-LRB-
he
could
not
,
indeed
,
have
been
altogether
*NL*
unaware
of
his
existence
-RRB-
he
would
have
sent
him
back
to
the
cottage
,
as
*NL*
the
child
would
only
have
been
in
the
way
of
his
debaucheries
.
But
a
*NL*
cousin
of
Mitya
's
mother
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
Miuesov
,
happened
to
return
*NL*
from
Paris
.
He
lived
for
many
years
afterwards
abroad
,
but
was
at
that
*NL*
time
quite
a
young
man
,
and
distinguished
among
the
Miuesovs
as
a
man
of
*NL*
enlightened
ideas
and
of
European
culture
,
who
had
been
in
the
capitals
*NL*
and
abroad
.
Towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
became
a
Liberal
of
the
type
*NL*
common
in
the
forties
and
fifties
.
In
the
course
of
his
career
he
had
come
*NL*
into
contact
with
many
of
the
most
Liberal
men
of
his
epoch
,
both
in
*NL*
Russia
and
abroad
.
He
had
known
Proudhon
and
Bakunin
personally
,
and
in
*NL*
his
declining
years
was
very
fond
of
describing
the
three
days
of
the
*NL*
Paris
Revolution
of
February
1848
,
hinting
that
he
himself
had
almost
*NL*
taken
part
in
the
fighting
on
the
barricades
.
This
was
one
of
the
most
*NL*
grateful
recollections
of
his
youth
.
He
had
an
independent
property
of
*NL*
about
a
thousand
souls
,
to
reckon
in
the
old
style
.
His
splendid
estate
*NL*
lay
on
the
outskirts
of
our
little
town
and
bordered
on
the
lands
of
our
*NL*
famous
monastery
,
with
which
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
began
an
endless
*NL*
lawsuit
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
estate
,
concerning
the
rights
*NL*
of
fishing
in
the
river
or
wood-cutting
in
the
forest
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
exactly
which
.
He
regarded
it
as
his
duty
as
a
citizen
and
a
man
of
*NL*
culture
to
open
an
attack
upon
the
``
clericals
.
''
Hearing
all
about
Adelaida
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
whom
he
,
of
course
,
remembered
,
and
in
whom
he
had
at
one
time
*NL*
been
interested
,
and
learning
of
the
existence
of
Mitya
,
he
intervened
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
his
youthful
indignation
and
contempt
for
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
He
made
the
latter
's
acquaintance
for
the
first
time
,
and
told
him
*NL*
directly
that
he
wished
to
undertake
the
child
's
education
.
He
used
long
*NL*
afterwards
to
tell
as
a
characteristic
touch
,
that
when
he
began
to
speak
*NL*
of
Mitya
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
looked
for
some
time
as
though
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
what
child
he
was
talking
about
,
and
even
as
though
he
was
*NL*
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
a
little
son
in
the
house
.
The
story
may
*NL*
have
been
exaggerated
,
yet
it
must
have
been
something
like
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
all
his
life
fond
of
acting
,
of
suddenly
playing
an
*NL*
unexpected
part
,
sometimes
without
any
motive
for
doing
so
,
and
even
to
*NL*
his
own
direct
disadvantage
,
as
,
for
instance
,
in
the
present
case
.
This
*NL*
habit
,
however
,
is
characteristic
of
a
very
great
number
of
people
,
some
*NL*
of
them
very
clever
ones
,
not
like
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
carried
the
business
through
vigorously
,
and
was
appointed
,
with
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
joint
guardian
of
the
child
,
who
had
a
small
property
,
a
house
*NL*
and
land
,
left
him
by
his
mother
.
Mitya
did
,
in
fact
,
pass
into
this
*NL*
cousin
's
keeping
,
but
as
the
latter
had
no
family
of
his
own
,
and
after
*NL*
securing
the
revenues
of
his
estates
was
in
haste
to
return
at
once
to
*NL*
Paris
,
he
left
the
boy
in
charge
of
one
of
his
cousins
,
a
lady
living
in
*NL*
Moscow
.
It
came
to
pass
that
,
settling
permanently
in
Paris
he
,
too
,
*NL*
forgot
the
child
,
especially
when
the
Revolution
of
February
broke
out
,
*NL*
making
an
impression
on
his
mind
that
he
remembered
all
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
life
.
The
Moscow
lady
died
,
and
Mitya
passed
into
the
care
of
one
of
her
*NL*
married
daughters
.
I
believe
he
changed
his
home
a
fourth
time
later
on
.
I
*NL*
wo
n't
enlarge
upon
that
now
,
as
I
shall
have
much
to
tell
later
of
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
firstborn
,
and
must
confine
myself
now
to
the
most
essential
*NL*
facts
about
him
,
without
which
I
could
not
begin
my
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
this
Mitya
,
or
rather
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
was
the
*NL*
only
one
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
three
sons
who
grew
up
in
the
belief
that
*NL*
he
had
property
,
and
that
he
would
be
independent
on
coming
of
age
.
He
*NL*
spent
an
irregular
boyhood
and
youth
.
He
did
not
finish
his
studies
at
the
*NL*
gymnasium
,
he
got
into
a
military
school
,
then
went
to
the
Caucasus
,
was
*NL*
promoted
,
fought
a
duel
,
and
was
degraded
to
the
ranks
,
earned
promotion
*NL*
again
,
led
a
wild
life
,
and
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
.
He
did
not
begin
*NL*
to
receive
any
income
from
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
until
he
came
of
age
,
and
*NL*
until
then
got
into
debt
.
He
saw
and
knew
his
father
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
on
coming
of
age
,
when
he
visited
our
neighborhood
on
*NL*
purpose
to
settle
with
him
about
his
property
.
He
seems
not
to
have
liked
*NL*
his
father
.
He
did
not
stay
long
with
him
,
and
made
haste
to
get
away
,
*NL*
having
only
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
sum
of
money
,
and
entering
into
an
*NL*
agreement
for
future
payments
from
the
estate
,
of
the
revenues
and
value
*NL*
of
which
he
was
unable
-LRB-
a
fact
worthy
of
note
-RRB-
,
upon
this
occasion
,
to
get
*NL*
a
statement
from
his
father
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
remarked
for
the
first
time
*NL*
then
-LRB-
this
,
too
,
should
be
noted
-RRB-
that
Mitya
had
a
vague
and
exaggerated
*NL*
idea
of
his
property
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
,
*NL*
as
it
fell
in
with
his
own
designs
.
He
gathered
only
that
the
young
man
*NL*
was
frivolous
,
unruly
,
of
violent
passions
,
impatient
,
and
dissipated
,
and
*NL*
that
if
he
could
only
obtain
ready
money
he
would
be
satisfied
,
although
*NL*
only
,
of
course
,
for
a
short
time
.
So
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
began
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
this
fact
,
sending
him
from
time
to
time
small
doles
,
*NL*
installments
.
In
the
end
,
when
four
years
later
,
Mitya
,
losing
patience
,
*NL*
came
a
second
time
to
our
little
town
to
settle
up
once
for
all
with
his
*NL*
father
,
it
turned
out
to
his
amazement
that
he
had
nothing
,
that
it
was
*NL*
difficult
to
get
an
account
even
,
that
he
had
received
the
whole
value
of
*NL*
his
property
in
sums
of
money
from
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
and
was
perhaps
even
*NL*
in
debt
to
him
,
that
by
various
agreements
into
which
he
had
,
of
his
own
*NL*
desire
,
entered
at
various
previous
dates
,
he
had
no
right
to
expect
*NL*
anything
more
,
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
The
young
man
was
overwhelmed
,
*NL*
suspected
deceit
and
cheating
,
and
was
almost
beside
himself
.
And
,
indeed
,
*NL*
this
circumstance
led
to
the
catastrophe
,
the
account
of
which
forms
the
*NL*
subject
of
my
first
introductory
story
,
or
rather
the
external
side
of
it
.
*NL*
But
before
I
pass
to
that
story
I
must
say
a
little
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
other
two
sons
,
and
of
their
origin
.

Chapter
III
.
The
Second
Marriage
And
The
Second
Family
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Very
shortly
after
getting
his
four-year-old
Mitya
off
his
hands
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
married
a
second
time
.
His
second
marriage
lasted
eight
years
.
*NL*
He
took
this
second
wife
,
Sofya
Ivanovna
,
also
a
very
young
girl
,
from
*NL*
another
province
,
where
he
had
gone
upon
some
small
piece
of
business
in
*NL*
company
with
a
Jew
.
Though
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
a
drunkard
and
a
vicious
*NL*
debauchee
he
never
neglected
investing
his
capital
,
and
managed
his
*NL*
business
affairs
very
successfully
,
though
,
no
doubt
,
not
over
-
*NL*
scrupulously
.
Sofya
Ivanovna
was
the
daughter
of
an
obscure
deacon
,
and
*NL*
was
left
from
childhood
an
orphan
without
relations
.
She
grew
up
in
the
*NL*
house
of
a
general
's
widow
,
a
wealthy
old
lady
of
good
position
,
who
was
*NL*
at
once
her
benefactress
and
tormentor
.
I
do
not
know
the
details
,
but
I
*NL*
have
only
heard
that
the
orphan
girl
,
a
meek
and
gentle
creature
,
was
once
*NL*
cut
down
from
a
halter
in
which
she
was
hanging
from
a
nail
in
the
loft
,
*NL*
so
terrible
were
her
sufferings
from
the
caprice
and
everlasting
nagging
*NL*
of
this
old
woman
,
who
was
apparently
not
bad-hearted
but
had
become
an
*NL*
insufferable
tyrant
through
idleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
made
her
an
offer
;
inquiries
were
made
about
him
and
he
*NL*
was
refused
.
But
again
,
as
in
his
first
marriage
,
he
proposed
an
elopement
*NL*
to
the
orphan
girl
.
There
is
very
little
doubt
that
she
would
not
on
any
*NL*
account
have
married
him
if
she
had
known
a
little
more
about
him
in
time
.
*NL*
But
she
lived
in
another
province
;
besides
,
what
could
a
little
girl
of
*NL*
sixteen
know
about
it
,
except
that
she
would
be
better
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
river
than
remaining
with
her
benefactress
.
So
the
poor
child
*NL*
exchanged
a
benefactress
for
a
benefactor
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
did
not
get
a
*NL*
penny
this
time
,
for
the
general
's
widow
was
furious
.
She
gave
them
*NL*
nothing
and
cursed
them
both
.
But
he
had
not
reckoned
on
a
dowry
;
what
*NL*
allured
him
was
the
remarkable
beauty
of
the
innocent
girl
,
above
all
her
*NL*
innocent
appearance
,
which
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
a
vicious
*NL*
profligate
,
who
had
hitherto
admired
only
the
coarser
types
of
feminine
*NL*
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
innocent
eyes
slit
my
soul
up
like
a
razor
,
''
he
used
to
say
*NL*
afterwards
,
with
his
loathsome
snigger
.
In
a
man
so
depraved
this
might
,
*NL*
of
course
,
mean
no
more
than
sensual
attraction
.
As
he
had
received
no
*NL*
dowry
with
his
wife
,
and
had
,
so
to
speak
,
taken
her
``
from
the
halter
,
''
he
*NL*
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
her
.
Making
her
feel
that
she
had
``
wronged
''
*NL*
him
,
he
took
advantage
of
her
phenomenal
meekness
and
submissiveness
to
*NL*
trample
on
the
elementary
decencies
of
marriage
.
He
gathered
loose
women
*NL*
into
his
house
,
and
carried
on
orgies
of
debauchery
in
his
wife
's
*NL*
presence
.
To
show
what
a
pass
things
had
come
to
,
I
may
mention
that
*NL*
Grigory
,
the
gloomy
,
stupid
,
obstinate
,
argumentative
servant
,
who
had
*NL*
always
hated
his
first
mistress
,
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
took
the
side
of
his
*NL*
new
mistress
.
He
championed
her
cause
,
abusing
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
in
a
*NL*
manner
little
befitting
a
servant
,
and
on
one
occasion
broke
up
the
revels
*NL*
and
drove
all
the
disorderly
women
out
of
the
house
.
In
the
end
this
*NL*
unhappy
young
woman
,
kept
in
terror
from
her
childhood
,
fell
into
that
*NL*
kind
of
nervous
disease
which
is
most
frequently
found
in
peasant
women
*NL*
who
are
said
to
be
``
possessed
by
devils
.
''
At
times
after
terrible
fits
of
*NL*
hysterics
she
even
lost
her
reason
.
Yet
she
bore
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
two
*NL*
sons
,
Ivan
and
Alexey
,
the
eldest
in
the
first
year
of
marriage
and
the
*NL*
second
three
years
later
.
When
she
died
,
little
Alexey
was
in
his
fourth
*NL*
year
,
and
,
strange
as
it
seems
,
I
know
that
he
remembered
his
mother
all
*NL*
his
life
,
like
a
dream
,
of
course
.
At
her
death
almost
exactly
the
same
*NL*
thing
happened
to
the
two
little
boys
as
to
their
elder
brother
,
Mitya
.
*NL*
They
were
completely
forgotten
and
abandoned
by
their
father
.
They
were
*NL*
looked
after
by
the
same
Grigory
and
lived
in
his
cottage
,
where
they
were
*NL*
found
by
the
tyrannical
old
lady
who
had
brought
up
their
mother
.
She
was
*NL*
still
alive
,
and
had
not
,
all
those
eight
years
,
forgotten
the
insult
done
*NL*
her
.
All
that
time
she
was
obtaining
exact
information
as
to
her
Sofya
's
*NL*
manner
of
life
,
and
hearing
of
her
illness
and
hideous
surroundings
she
*NL*
declared
aloud
two
or
three
times
to
her
retainers
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves
her
right
.
God
has
punished
her
for
her
ingratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Exactly
three
months
after
Sofya
Ivanovna
's
death
the
general
's
widow
*NL*
suddenly
appeared
in
our
town
,
and
went
straight
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
house
.
She
spent
only
half
an
hour
in
the
town
but
she
did
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
It
was
evening
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
those
eight
*NL*
years
,
came
in
to
her
drunk
.
The
story
is
that
instantly
upon
seeing
him
,
*NL*
without
any
sort
of
explanation
,
she
gave
him
two
good
,
resounding
slaps
*NL*
on
the
face
,
seized
him
by
a
tuft
of
hair
,
and
shook
him
three
times
up
*NL*
and
down
.
Then
,
without
a
word
,
she
went
straight
to
the
cottage
to
the
*NL*
two
boys
.
Seeing
,
at
the
first
glance
,
that
they
were
unwashed
and
in
*NL*
dirty
linen
,
she
promptly
gave
Grigory
,
too
,
a
box
on
the
ear
,
and
*NL*
announcing
that
she
would
carry
off
both
the
children
she
wrapped
them
*NL*
just
as
they
were
in
a
rug
,
put
them
in
the
carriage
,
and
drove
off
to
her
*NL*
own
town
.
Grigory
accepted
the
blow
like
a
devoted
slave
,
without
a
word
,
*NL*
and
when
he
escorted
the
old
lady
to
her
carriage
he
made
her
a
low
bow
*NL*
and
pronounced
impressively
that
,
``
God
would
repay
her
for
the
orphans
.
''
*NL*
``
You
are
a
blockhead
all
the
same
,
''
the
old
lady
shouted
to
him
as
she
*NL*
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
thinking
it
over
,
decided
that
it
was
a
good
thing
,
and
*NL*
did
not
refuse
the
general
's
widow
his
formal
consent
to
any
proposition
*NL*
in
regard
to
his
children
's
education
.
As
for
the
slaps
she
had
given
him
,
*NL*
he
drove
all
over
the
town
telling
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
the
old
lady
died
soon
after
this
,
but
she
left
the
boys
*NL*
in
her
will
a
thousand
roubles
each
``
for
their
instruction
,
and
so
that
*NL*
all
be
spent
on
them
exclusively
,
with
the
condition
that
it
be
so
*NL*
portioned
out
as
to
last
till
they
are
twenty-one
,
for
it
is
more
than
*NL*
adequate
provision
for
such
children
.
If
other
people
think
fit
to
throw
*NL*
away
their
money
,
let
them
.
''
I
have
not
read
the
will
myself
,
but
I
heard
*NL*
there
was
something
queer
of
the
sort
,
very
whimsically
expressed
.
The
*NL*
principal
heir
,
Yefim
Petrovitch
Polenov
,
the
Marshal
of
Nobility
of
the
*NL*
province
,
turned
out
,
however
,
to
be
an
honest
man
.
Writing
to
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
and
discerning
at
once
that
he
could
extract
nothing
from
him
*NL*
for
his
children
's
education
-LRB-
though
the
latter
never
directly
refused
but
*NL*
only
procrastinated
as
he
always
did
in
such
cases
,
and
was
,
indeed
,
at
*NL*
times
effusively
sentimental
-RRB-
,
Yefim
Petrovitch
took
a
personal
interest
*NL*
in
the
orphans
.
He
became
especially
fond
of
the
younger
,
Alexey
,
who
*NL*
lived
for
a
long
while
as
one
of
his
family
.
I
beg
the
reader
to
note
this
*NL*
from
the
beginning
.
And
to
Yefim
Petrovitch
,
a
man
of
a
generosity
and
*NL*
humanity
rarely
to
be
met
with
,
the
young
people
were
more
indebted
for
*NL*
their
education
and
bringing
up
than
to
any
one
.
He
kept
the
two
thousand
*NL*
roubles
left
to
them
by
the
general
's
widow
intact
,
so
that
by
the
time
*NL*
they
came
of
age
their
portions
had
been
doubled
by
the
accumulation
of
*NL*
interest
.
He
educated
them
both
at
his
own
expense
,
and
certainly
spent
*NL*
far
more
than
a
thousand
roubles
upon
each
of
them
.
I
wo
n't
enter
into
a
*NL*
detailed
account
of
their
boyhood
and
youth
,
but
will
only
mention
a
few
*NL*
of
the
most
important
events
.
Of
the
elder
,
Ivan
,
I
will
only
say
that
he
*NL*
grew
into
a
somewhat
morose
and
reserved
,
though
far
from
timid
boy
.
At
*NL*
ten
years
old
he
had
realized
that
they
were
living
not
in
their
own
home
*NL*
but
on
other
people
's
charity
,
and
that
their
father
was
a
man
of
whom
it
*NL*
was
disgraceful
to
speak
.
This
boy
began
very
early
,
almost
in
his
infancy
*NL*
-LRB-
so
they
say
at
least
-RRB-
,
to
show
a
brilliant
and
unusual
aptitude
for
*NL*
learning
.
I
do
n't
know
precisely
why
,
but
he
left
the
family
of
Yefim
*NL*
Petrovitch
when
he
was
hardly
thirteen
,
entering
a
Moscow
gymnasium
,
and
*NL*
boarding
with
an
experienced
and
celebrated
teacher
,
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
Yefim
Petrovitch
.
Ivan
used
to
declare
afterwards
that
this
was
all
due
to
*NL*
the
``
ardor
for
good
works
''
of
Yefim
Petrovitch
,
who
was
captivated
by
the
*NL*
idea
that
the
boy
's
genius
should
be
trained
by
a
teacher
of
genius
.
But
*NL*
neither
Yefim
Petrovitch
nor
this
teacher
was
living
when
the
young
man
*NL*
finished
at
the
gymnasium
and
entered
the
university
.
As
Yefim
Petrovitch
*NL*
had
made
no
provision
for
the
payment
of
the
tyrannical
old
lady
's
legacy
,
*NL*
which
had
grown
from
one
thousand
to
two
,
it
was
delayed
,
owing
to
*NL*
formalities
inevitable
in
Russia
,
and
the
young
man
was
in
great
straits
*NL*
for
the
first
two
years
at
the
university
,
as
he
was
forced
to
keep
*NL*
himself
all
the
time
he
was
studying
.
It
must
be
noted
that
he
did
not
*NL*
even
attempt
to
communicate
with
his
father
,
perhaps
from
pride
,
from
*NL*
contempt
for
him
,
or
perhaps
from
his
cool
common
sense
,
which
told
him
*NL*
that
from
such
a
father
he
would
get
no
real
assistance
.
However
that
may
*NL*
have
been
,
the
young
man
was
by
no
means
despondent
and
succeeded
in
*NL*
getting
work
,
at
first
giving
sixpenny
lessons
and
afterwards
getting
*NL*
paragraphs
on
street
incidents
into
the
newspapers
under
the
signature
of
*NL*
``
Eye-Witness
.
''
These
paragraphs
,
it
was
said
,
were
so
interesting
and
*NL*
piquant
that
they
were
soon
taken
.
This
alone
showed
the
young
man
's
*NL*
practical
and
intellectual
superiority
over
the
masses
of
needy
and
*NL*
unfortunate
students
of
both
sexes
who
hang
about
the
offices
of
the
*NL*
newspapers
and
journals
,
unable
to
think
of
anything
better
than
*NL*
everlasting
entreaties
for
copying
and
translations
from
the
French
.
*NL*
Having
once
got
into
touch
with
the
editors
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
always
kept
*NL*
up
his
connection
with
them
,
and
in
his
latter
years
at
the
university
he
*NL*
published
brilliant
reviews
of
books
upon
various
special
subjects
,
so
*NL*
that
he
became
well
known
in
literary
circles
.
But
only
in
his
last
year
*NL*
he
suddenly
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
a
far
wider
circle
of
*NL*
readers
,
so
that
a
great
many
people
noticed
and
remembered
him
.
It
was
*NL*
rather
a
curious
incident
.
When
he
had
just
left
the
university
and
was
*NL*
preparing
to
go
abroad
upon
his
two
thousand
roubles
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
*NL*
published
in
one
of
the
more
important
journals
a
strange
article
,
which
*NL*
attracted
general
notice
,
on
a
subject
of
which
he
might
have
been
*NL*
supposed
to
know
nothing
,
as
he
was
a
student
of
natural
science
.
The
*NL*
article
dealt
with
a
subject
which
was
being
debated
everywhere
at
the
*NL*
time
--
the
position
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
.
After
discussing
several
*NL*
opinions
on
the
subject
he
went
on
to
explain
his
own
view
.
What
was
most
*NL*
striking
about
the
article
was
its
tone
,
and
its
unexpected
conclusion
.
*NL*
Many
of
the
Church
party
regarded
him
unquestioningly
as
on
their
side
.
*NL*
And
yet
not
only
the
secularists
but
even
atheists
joined
them
in
their
*NL*
applause
.
Finally
some
sagacious
persons
opined
that
the
article
was
*NL*
nothing
but
an
impudent
satirical
burlesque
.
I
mention
this
incident
*NL*
particularly
because
this
article
penetrated
into
the
famous
monastery
in
*NL*
our
neighborhood
,
where
the
inmates
,
being
particularly
interested
in
the
*NL*
question
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
,
were
completely
bewildered
by
it
.
*NL*
Learning
the
author
's
name
,
they
were
interested
in
his
being
a
native
of
*NL*
the
town
and
the
son
of
``
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
''
And
just
then
it
was
*NL*
that
the
author
himself
made
his
appearance
among
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
had
come
amongst
us
I
remember
asking
myself
at
the
*NL*
time
with
a
certain
uneasiness
.
This
fateful
visit
,
which
was
the
first
*NL*
step
leading
to
so
many
consequences
,
I
never
fully
explained
to
myself
.
*NL*
It
seemed
strange
on
the
face
of
it
that
a
young
man
so
learned
,
so
proud
,
*NL*
and
apparently
so
cautious
,
should
suddenly
visit
such
an
infamous
house
*NL*
and
a
father
who
had
ignored
him
all
his
life
,
hardly
knew
him
,
never
*NL*
thought
of
him
,
and
would
not
under
any
circumstances
have
given
him
*NL*
money
,
though
he
was
always
afraid
that
his
sons
Ivan
and
Alexey
would
*NL*
also
come
to
ask
him
for
it
.
And
here
the
young
man
was
staying
in
the
*NL*
house
of
such
a
father
,
had
been
living
with
him
for
two
months
,
and
they
*NL*
were
on
the
best
possible
terms
.
This
last
fact
was
a
special
cause
of
*NL*
wonder
to
many
others
as
well
as
to
me
.
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
Miuesov
,
of
*NL*
whom
we
have
spoken
already
,
the
cousin
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
first
wife
,
*NL*
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
again
on
a
visit
to
his
estate
.
He
had
*NL*
come
from
Paris
,
which
was
his
permanent
home
.
I
remember
that
he
was
more
*NL*
surprised
than
any
one
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
man
,
who
*NL*
interested
him
extremely
,
and
with
whom
he
sometimes
argued
and
not
*NL*
without
an
inner
pang
compared
himself
in
acquirements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
proud
,
''
he
used
to
say
,
``
he
will
never
be
in
want
of
pence
;
he
has
*NL*
got
money
enough
to
go
abroad
now
.
What
does
he
want
here
?
Every
one
can
*NL*
see
that
he
has
n't
come
for
money
,
for
his
father
would
never
give
him
*NL*
any
.
He
has
no
taste
for
drink
and
dissipation
,
and
yet
his
father
ca
n't
*NL*
do
without
him
.
They
get
on
so
well
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
truth
;
the
young
man
had
an
unmistakable
influence
over
his
*NL*
father
,
who
positively
appeared
to
be
behaving
more
decently
and
even
*NL*
seemed
at
times
ready
to
obey
his
son
,
though
often
extremely
and
even
*NL*
spitefully
perverse
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
later
that
we
learned
that
Ivan
had
come
partly
at
the
request
*NL*
of
,
and
in
the
interests
of
,
his
elder
brother
,
Dmitri
,
whom
he
saw
for
*NL*
the
first
time
on
this
very
visit
,
though
he
had
before
leaving
Moscow
*NL*
been
in
correspondence
with
him
about
an
important
matter
of
more
concern
*NL*
to
Dmitri
than
himself
.
What
that
business
was
the
reader
will
learn
fully
*NL*
in
due
time
.
Yet
even
when
I
did
know
of
this
special
circumstance
I
still
*NL*
felt
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
to
be
an
enigmatic
figure
,
and
thought
his
visit
*NL*
rather
mysterious
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
add
that
Ivan
appeared
at
the
time
in
the
light
of
a
mediator
*NL*
between
his
father
and
his
elder
brother
Dmitri
,
who
was
in
open
quarrel
*NL*
with
his
father
and
even
planning
to
bring
an
action
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
,
I
repeat
,
was
now
united
for
the
first
time
,
and
some
of
its
*NL*
members
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
.
The
younger
brother
,
*NL*
Alexey
,
had
been
a
year
already
among
us
,
having
been
the
first
of
the
*NL*
three
to
arrive
.
It
is
of
that
brother
Alexey
I
find
it
most
difficult
to
*NL*
speak
in
this
introduction
.
Yet
I
must
give
some
preliminary
account
of
*NL*
him
,
if
only
to
explain
one
queer
fact
,
which
is
that
I
have
to
introduce
*NL*
my
hero
to
the
reader
wearing
the
cassock
of
a
novice
.
Yes
,
he
had
been
*NL*
for
the
last
year
in
our
monastery
,
and
seemed
willing
to
be
cloistered
*NL*
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
IV
.
The
Third
Son
,
Alyosha
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
only
twenty
,
his
brother
Ivan
was
in
his
twenty-fourth
year
at
the
*NL*
time
,
while
their
elder
brother
Dmitri
was
twenty-seven
.
First
of
all
,
I
*NL*
must
explain
that
this
young
man
,
Alyosha
,
was
not
a
fanatic
,
and
,
in
my
*NL*
opinion
at
least
,
was
not
even
a
mystic
.
I
may
as
well
give
my
full
*NL*
opinion
from
the
beginning
.
He
was
simply
an
early
lover
of
humanity
,
and
*NL*
that
he
adopted
the
monastic
life
was
simply
because
at
that
time
it
*NL*
struck
him
,
so
to
say
,
as
the
ideal
escape
for
his
soul
struggling
from
*NL*
the
darkness
of
worldly
wickedness
to
the
light
of
love
.
And
the
reason
*NL*
this
life
struck
him
in
this
way
was
that
he
found
in
it
at
that
time
,
as
*NL*
he
thought
,
an
extraordinary
being
,
our
celebrated
elder
,
Zossima
,
to
whom
*NL*
he
became
attached
with
all
the
warm
first
love
of
his
ardent
heart
.
But
I
*NL*
do
not
dispute
that
he
was
very
strange
even
at
that
time
,
and
had
been
so
*NL*
indeed
from
his
cradle
.
I
have
mentioned
already
,
by
the
way
,
that
though
*NL*
he
lost
his
mother
in
his
fourth
year
he
remembered
her
all
his
life
--
her
*NL*
face
,
her
caresses
,
``
as
though
she
stood
living
before
me
.
''
Such
memories
*NL*
may
persist
,
as
every
one
knows
,
from
an
even
earlier
age
,
even
from
two
*NL*
years
old
,
but
scarcely
standing
out
through
a
whole
lifetime
like
spots
*NL*
of
light
out
of
darkness
,
like
a
corner
torn
out
of
a
huge
picture
,
which
*NL*
has
all
faded
and
disappeared
except
that
fragment
.
That
is
how
it
was
*NL*
with
him
.
He
remembered
one
still
summer
evening
,
an
open
window
,
the
*NL*
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
-LRB-
that
he
recalled
most
vividly
of
all
-RRB-
;
*NL*
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
holy
image
,
before
it
a
lighted
lamp
,
and
on
*NL*
her
knees
before
the
image
his
mother
,
sobbing
hysterically
with
cries
and
*NL*
moans
,
snatching
him
up
in
both
arms
,
squeezing
him
close
till
it
hurt
,
*NL*
and
praying
for
him
to
the
Mother
of
God
,
holding
him
out
in
both
arms
to
*NL*
the
image
as
though
to
put
him
under
the
Mother
's
protection
...
and
*NL*
suddenly
a
nurse
runs
in
and
snatches
him
from
her
in
terror
.
That
was
the
*NL*
picture
!
And
Alyosha
remembered
his
mother
's
face
at
that
minute
.
He
used
*NL*
to
say
that
it
was
frenzied
but
beautiful
as
he
remembered
.
But
he
rarely
*NL*
cared
to
speak
of
this
memory
to
any
one
.
In
his
childhood
and
youth
he
*NL*
was
by
no
means
expansive
,
and
talked
little
indeed
,
but
not
from
shyness
*NL*
or
a
sullen
unsociability
;
quite
the
contrary
,
from
something
different
,
*NL*
from
a
sort
of
inner
preoccupation
entirely
personal
and
unconcerned
with
*NL*
other
people
,
but
so
important
to
him
that
he
seemed
,
as
it
were
,
to
*NL*
forget
others
on
account
of
it
.
But
he
was
fond
of
people
:
he
seemed
*NL*
throughout
his
life
to
put
implicit
trust
in
people
:
yet
no
one
ever
*NL*
looked
on
him
as
a
simpleton
or
naive
person
.
There
was
something
about
*NL*
him
which
made
one
feel
at
once
-LRB-
and
it
was
so
all
his
life
afterwards
-RRB-
*NL*
that
he
did
not
care
to
be
a
judge
of
others
--
that
he
would
never
take
it
*NL*
upon
himself
to
criticize
and
would
never
condemn
any
one
for
anything
.
He
*NL*
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
accept
everything
without
the
least
condemnation
though
*NL*
often
grieving
bitterly
:
and
this
was
so
much
so
that
no
one
could
*NL*
surprise
or
frighten
him
even
in
his
earliest
youth
.
Coming
at
twenty
to
*NL*
his
father
's
house
,
which
was
a
very
sink
of
filthy
debauchery
,
he
,
chaste
*NL*
and
pure
as
he
was
,
simply
withdrew
in
silence
when
to
look
on
was
*NL*
unbearable
,
but
without
the
slightest
sign
of
contempt
or
condemnation
.
*NL*
His
father
,
who
had
once
been
in
a
dependent
position
,
and
so
was
*NL*
sensitive
and
ready
to
take
offense
,
met
him
at
first
with
distrust
and
*NL*
sullenness
.
``
He
does
not
say
much
,
''
he
used
to
say
,
``
and
thinks
the
more
.
''
*NL*
But
soon
,
within
a
fortnight
indeed
,
he
took
to
embracing
him
and
kissing
*NL*
him
terribly
often
,
with
drunken
tears
,
with
sottish
sentimentality
,
yet
*NL*
he
evidently
felt
a
real
and
deep
affection
for
him
,
such
as
he
had
never
*NL*
been
capable
of
feeling
for
any
one
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
,
indeed
,
loved
this
young
man
wherever
he
went
,
and
it
was
so
*NL*
from
his
earliest
childhood
.
When
he
entered
the
household
of
his
patron
*NL*
and
benefactor
,
Yefim
Petrovitch
Polenov
,
he
gained
the
hearts
of
all
the
*NL*
family
,
so
that
they
looked
on
him
quite
as
their
own
child
.
Yet
he
*NL*
entered
the
house
at
such
a
tender
age
that
he
could
not
have
acted
from
*NL*
design
nor
artfulness
in
winning
affection
.
So
that
the
gift
of
making
*NL*
himself
loved
directly
and
unconsciously
was
inherent
in
him
,
in
his
very
*NL*
nature
,
so
to
speak
.
It
was
the
same
at
school
,
though
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
just
one
of
those
children
who
are
distrusted
,
sometimes
ridiculed
,
and
*NL*
even
disliked
by
their
schoolfellows
.
He
was
dreamy
,
for
instance
,
and
*NL*
rather
solitary
.
From
his
earliest
childhood
he
was
fond
of
creeping
into
*NL*
a
corner
to
read
,
and
yet
he
was
a
general
favorite
all
the
while
he
was
*NL*
at
school
.
He
was
rarely
playful
or
merry
,
but
any
one
could
see
at
the
*NL*
first
glance
that
this
was
not
from
any
sullenness
.
On
the
contrary
he
was
*NL*
bright
and
good-tempered
.
He
never
tried
to
show
off
among
his
*NL*
schoolfellows
.
Perhaps
because
of
this
,
he
was
never
afraid
of
any
one
,
*NL*
yet
the
boys
immediately
understood
that
he
was
not
proud
of
his
*NL*
fearlessness
and
seemed
to
be
unaware
that
he
was
bold
and
courageous
.
He
*NL*
never
resented
an
insult
.
It
would
happen
that
an
hour
after
the
offense
*NL*
he
would
address
the
offender
or
answer
some
question
with
as
trustful
and
*NL*
candid
an
expression
as
though
nothing
had
happened
between
them
.
And
it
*NL*
was
not
that
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
or
intentionally
forgiven
the
*NL*
affront
,
but
simply
that
he
did
not
regard
it
as
an
affront
,
and
this
*NL*
completely
conquered
and
captivated
the
boys
.
He
had
one
characteristic
*NL*
which
made
all
his
schoolfellows
from
the
bottom
class
to
the
top
want
to
*NL*
mock
at
him
,
not
from
malice
but
because
it
amused
them
.
This
*NL*
characteristic
was
a
wild
fanatical
modesty
and
chastity
.
He
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
hear
certain
words
and
certain
conversations
about
women
.
There
*NL*
are
``
certain
''
words
and
conversations
unhappily
impossible
to
eradicate
in
*NL*
schools
.
Boys
pure
in
mind
and
heart
,
almost
children
,
are
fond
of
talking
*NL*
in
school
among
themselves
,
and
even
aloud
,
of
things
,
pictures
,
and
*NL*
images
of
which
even
soldiers
would
sometimes
hesitate
to
speak
.
More
than
*NL*
that
,
much
that
soldiers
have
no
knowledge
or
conception
of
is
familiar
to
*NL*
quite
young
children
of
our
intellectual
and
higher
classes
.
There
is
no
*NL*
moral
depravity
,
no
real
corrupt
inner
cynicism
in
it
,
but
there
is
the
*NL*
appearance
of
it
,
and
it
is
often
looked
upon
among
them
as
something
*NL*
refined
,
subtle
,
daring
,
and
worthy
of
imitation
.
Seeing
that
Alyosha
*NL*
Karamazov
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
when
they
talked
of
``
that
,
''
they
*NL*
used
sometimes
to
crowd
round
him
,
pull
his
hands
away
,
and
shout
*NL*
nastiness
into
both
ears
,
while
he
struggled
,
slipped
to
the
floor
,
tried
*NL*
to
hide
himself
without
uttering
one
word
of
abuse
,
enduring
their
insults
*NL*
in
silence
.
But
at
last
they
left
him
alone
and
gave
up
taunting
him
with
*NL*
being
a
``
regular
girl
,
''
and
what
's
more
they
looked
upon
it
with
*NL*
compassion
as
a
weakness
.
He
was
always
one
of
the
best
in
the
class
but
*NL*
was
never
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
of
Yefim
Petrovitch
's
death
Alyosha
had
two
more
years
to
*NL*
complete
at
the
provincial
gymnasium
.
The
inconsolable
widow
went
almost
*NL*
immediately
after
his
death
for
a
long
visit
to
Italy
with
her
whole
*NL*
family
,
which
consisted
only
of
women
and
girls
.
Alyosha
went
to
live
in
*NL*
the
house
of
two
distant
relations
of
Yefim
Petrovitch
,
ladies
whom
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
before
.
On
what
terms
he
lived
with
them
he
did
not
know
*NL*
himself
.
It
was
very
characteristic
of
him
,
indeed
,
that
he
never
cared
at
*NL*
whose
expense
he
was
living
.
In
that
respect
he
was
a
striking
contrast
to
*NL*
his
elder
brother
Ivan
,
who
struggled
with
poverty
for
his
first
two
years
*NL*
in
the
university
,
maintained
himself
by
his
own
efforts
,
and
had
from
*NL*
childhood
been
bitterly
conscious
of
living
at
the
expense
of
his
*NL*
benefactor
.
But
this
strange
trait
in
Alyosha
's
character
must
not
,
I
*NL*
think
,
be
criticized
too
severely
,
for
at
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
*NL*
him
any
one
would
have
perceived
that
Alyosha
was
one
of
those
youths
,
*NL*
almost
of
the
type
of
religious
enthusiast
,
who
,
if
they
were
suddenly
to
*NL*
come
into
possession
of
a
large
fortune
,
would
not
hesitate
to
give
it
*NL*
away
for
the
asking
,
either
for
good
works
or
perhaps
to
a
clever
rogue
.
*NL*
In
general
he
seemed
scarcely
to
know
the
value
of
money
,
not
,
of
course
,
*NL*
in
a
literal
sense
.
When
he
was
given
pocket-money
,
which
he
never
asked
*NL*
for
,
he
was
either
terribly
careless
of
it
so
that
it
was
gone
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
or
he
kept
it
for
weeks
together
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
later
years
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
Miuesov
,
a
man
very
sensitive
on
the
*NL*
score
of
money
and
bourgeois
honesty
,
pronounced
the
following
judgment
,
*NL*
after
getting
to
know
Alyosha
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
perhaps
the
one
man
in
the
world
whom
you
might
leave
alone
*NL*
without
a
penny
,
in
the
center
of
an
unknown
town
of
a
million
*NL*
inhabitants
,
and
he
would
not
come
to
harm
,
he
would
not
die
of
cold
and
*NL*
hunger
,
for
he
would
be
fed
and
sheltered
at
once
;
and
if
he
were
not
,
he
*NL*
would
find
a
shelter
for
himself
,
and
it
would
cost
him
no
effort
or
*NL*
humiliation
.
And
to
shelter
him
would
be
no
burden
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
would
probably
be
looked
on
as
a
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
his
studies
at
the
gymnasium
.
A
year
before
the
end
of
*NL*
the
course
he
suddenly
announced
to
the
ladies
that
he
was
going
to
see
*NL*
his
father
about
a
plan
which
had
occurred
to
him
.
They
were
sorry
and
*NL*
unwilling
to
let
him
go
.
The
journey
was
not
an
expensive
one
,
and
the
*NL*
ladies
would
not
let
him
pawn
his
watch
,
a
parting
present
from
his
*NL*
benefactor
's
family
.
They
provided
him
liberally
with
money
and
even
*NL*
fitted
him
out
with
new
clothes
and
linen
.
But
he
returned
half
the
money
*NL*
they
gave
him
,
saying
that
he
intended
to
go
third
class
.
On
his
arrival
*NL*
in
the
town
he
made
no
answer
to
his
father
's
first
inquiry
why
he
had
*NL*
come
before
completing
his
studies
,
and
seemed
,
so
they
say
,
unusually
*NL*
thoughtful
.
It
soon
became
apparent
that
he
was
looking
for
his
mother
's
*NL*
tomb
.
He
practically
acknowledged
at
the
time
that
that
was
the
only
*NL*
object
of
his
visit
.
But
it
can
hardly
have
been
the
whole
reason
of
it
.
*NL*
It
is
more
probable
that
he
himself
did
not
understand
and
could
not
*NL*
explain
what
had
suddenly
arisen
in
his
soul
,
and
drawn
him
irresistibly
*NL*
into
a
new
,
unknown
,
but
inevitable
path
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
could
not
show
*NL*
him
where
his
second
wife
was
buried
,
for
he
had
never
visited
her
grave
*NL*
since
he
had
thrown
earth
upon
her
coffin
,
and
in
the
course
of
years
had
*NL*
entirely
forgotten
where
she
was
buried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
by
the
way
,
had
for
some
time
previously
not
been
*NL*
living
in
our
town
.
Three
or
four
years
after
his
wife
's
death
he
had
gone
*NL*
to
the
south
of
Russia
and
finally
turned
up
in
Odessa
,
where
he
spent
*NL*
several
years
.
He
made
the
acquaintance
at
first
,
in
his
own
words
,
``
of
a
*NL*
lot
of
low
Jews
,
Jewesses
,
and
Jewkins
,
''
and
ended
by
being
received
by
*NL*
``
Jews
high
and
low
alike
.
''
It
may
be
presumed
that
at
this
period
he
*NL*
developed
a
peculiar
faculty
for
making
and
hoarding
money
.
He
finally
*NL*
returned
to
our
town
only
three
years
before
Alyosha
's
arrival
.
His
former
*NL*
acquaintances
found
him
looking
terribly
aged
,
although
he
was
by
no
means
*NL*
an
old
man
.
He
behaved
not
exactly
with
more
dignity
but
with
more
*NL*
effrontery
.
The
former
buffoon
showed
an
insolent
propensity
for
making
*NL*
buffoons
of
others
.
His
depravity
with
women
was
not
simply
what
it
used
*NL*
to
be
,
but
even
more
revolting
.
In
a
short
time
he
opened
a
great
number
*NL*
of
new
taverns
in
the
district
.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
perhaps
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
roubles
or
not
much
less
.
Many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
town
and
district
were
soon
in
his
debt
,
and
,
of
course
,
had
given
good
*NL*
security
.
Of
late
,
too
,
he
looked
somehow
bloated
and
seemed
more
*NL*
irresponsible
,
more
uneven
,
had
sunk
into
a
sort
of
incoherence
,
used
to
*NL*
begin
one
thing
and
go
on
with
another
,
as
though
he
were
letting
himself
*NL*
go
altogether
.
He
was
more
and
more
frequently
drunk
.
And
,
if
it
had
not
*NL*
been
for
the
same
servant
Grigory
,
who
by
that
time
had
aged
considerably
*NL*
too
,
and
used
to
look
after
him
sometimes
almost
like
a
tutor
,
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
might
have
got
into
terrible
scrapes
.
Alyosha
's
arrival
seemed
*NL*
to
affect
even
his
moral
side
,
as
though
something
had
awakened
in
this
*NL*
prematurely
old
man
which
had
long
been
dead
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
he
used
often
to
say
,
looking
at
Alyosha
,
``
that
you
are
*NL*
like
her
,
`
the
crazy
woman
'
''
--
that
was
what
he
used
to
call
his
dead
wife
,
*NL*
Alyosha
's
mother
.
Grigory
it
was
who
pointed
out
the
``
crazy
woman
's
''
grave
*NL*
to
Alyosha
.
He
took
him
to
our
town
cemetery
and
showed
him
in
a
remote
*NL*
corner
a
cast-iron
tombstone
,
cheap
but
decently
kept
,
on
which
were
*NL*
inscribed
the
name
and
age
of
the
deceased
and
the
date
of
her
death
,
and
*NL*
below
a
four-lined
verse
,
such
as
are
commonly
used
on
old-fashioned
*NL*
middle-class
tombs
.
To
Alyosha
's
amazement
this
tomb
turned
out
to
be
*NL*
Grigory
's
doing
.
He
had
put
it
up
on
the
poor
``
crazy
woman
's
''
grave
at
his
*NL*
own
expense
,
after
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
whom
he
had
often
pestered
about
the
*NL*
grave
,
had
gone
to
Odessa
,
abandoning
the
grave
and
all
his
memories
.
*NL*
Alyosha
showed
no
particular
emotion
at
the
sight
of
his
mother
's
grave
.
*NL*
He
only
listened
to
Grigory
's
minute
and
solemn
account
of
the
erection
of
*NL*
the
tomb
;
he
stood
with
bowed
head
and
walked
away
without
uttering
a
*NL*
word
.
It
was
perhaps
a
year
before
he
visited
the
cemetery
again
.
But
this
*NL*
little
episode
was
not
without
an
influence
upon
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
--
and
a
*NL*
very
original
one
.
He
suddenly
took
a
thousand
roubles
to
our
monastery
to
*NL*
pay
for
requiems
for
the
soul
of
his
wife
;
but
not
for
the
second
,
*NL*
Alyosha
's
mother
,
the
``
crazy
woman
,
''
but
for
the
first
,
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
who
used
to
thrash
him
.
In
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
got
drunk
and
*NL*
abused
the
monks
to
Alyosha
.
He
himself
was
far
from
being
religious
;
he
*NL*
had
probably
never
put
a
penny
candle
before
the
image
of
a
saint
.
Strange
*NL*
impulses
of
sudden
feeling
and
sudden
thought
are
common
in
such
types
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
already
that
he
looked
bloated
.
His
countenance
at
this
*NL*
time
bore
traces
of
something
that
testified
unmistakably
to
the
life
he
*NL*
had
led
.
Besides
the
long
fleshy
bags
under
his
little
,
always
insolent
,
*NL*
suspicious
,
and
ironical
eyes
;
besides
the
multitude
of
deep
wrinkles
in
*NL*
his
little
fat
face
,
the
Adam
's
apple
hung
below
his
sharp
chin
like
a
*NL*
great
,
fleshy
goiter
,
which
gave
him
a
peculiar
,
repulsive
,
sensual
*NL*
appearance
;
add
to
that
a
long
rapacious
mouth
with
full
lips
,
between
*NL*
which
could
be
seen
little
stumps
of
black
decayed
teeth
.
He
slobbered
*NL*
every
time
he
began
to
speak
.
He
was
fond
indeed
of
making
fun
of
his
own
*NL*
face
,
though
,
I
believe
,
he
was
well
satisfied
with
it
.
He
used
*NL*
particularly
to
point
to
his
nose
,
which
was
not
very
large
,
but
very
*NL*
delicate
and
conspicuously
aquiline
.
``
A
regular
Roman
nose
,
''
he
used
to
*NL*
say
,
``
with
my
goiter
I
've
quite
the
countenance
of
an
ancient
Roman
*NL*
patrician
of
the
decadent
period
.
''
He
seemed
proud
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
visiting
his
mother
's
grave
Alyosha
suddenly
announced
that
*NL*
he
wanted
to
enter
the
monastery
,
and
that
the
monks
were
willing
to
*NL*
receive
him
as
a
novice
.
He
explained
that
this
was
his
strong
desire
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
solemnly
asking
his
consent
as
his
father
.
The
old
man
knew
*NL*
that
the
elder
Zossima
,
who
was
living
in
the
monastery
hermitage
,
had
*NL*
made
a
special
impression
upon
his
``
gentle
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
most
honest
monk
among
them
,
of
course
,
''
he
observed
,
after
*NL*
listening
in
thoughtful
silence
to
Alyosha
,
and
seeming
scarcely
surprised
*NL*
at
his
request
.
``
H
'm
!
...
So
that
's
where
you
want
to
be
,
my
gentle
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
half
drunk
,
and
suddenly
he
grinned
his
slow
half-drunken
grin
,
*NL*
which
was
not
without
a
certain
cunning
and
tipsy
slyness
.
``
H
'm
!
...
I
had
*NL*
a
presentiment
that
you
would
end
in
something
like
this
.
Would
you
*NL*
believe
it
?
You
were
making
straight
for
it
.
Well
,
to
be
sure
you
have
*NL*
your
own
two
thousand
.
That
's
a
dowry
for
you
.
And
I
'll
never
desert
you
,
*NL*
my
angel
.
And
I
'll
pay
what
's
wanted
for
you
there
,
if
they
ask
for
it
.
*NL*
But
,
of
course
,
if
they
do
n't
ask
,
why
should
we
worry
them
?
What
do
you
*NL*
say
?
You
know
,
you
spend
money
like
a
canary
,
two
grains
a
week
.
H
'm
!
...
*NL*
Do
you
know
that
near
one
monastery
there
's
a
place
outside
the
town
where
*NL*
every
baby
knows
there
are
none
but
`
the
monks
'
wives
'
living
,
as
they
are
*NL*
called
.
Thirty
women
,
I
believe
.
I
have
been
there
myself
.
You
know
,
it
's
*NL*
interesting
in
its
own
way
,
of
course
,
as
a
variety
.
The
worst
of
it
is
*NL*
it
's
awfully
Russian
.
There
are
no
French
women
there
.
Of
course
they
*NL*
could
get
them
fast
enough
,
they
have
plenty
of
money
.
If
they
get
to
hear
*NL*
of
it
they
'll
come
along
.
Well
,
there
's
nothing
of
that
sort
here
,
no
*NL*
`
monks
'
wives
,
'
and
two
hundred
monks
.
They
're
honest
.
They
keep
the
*NL*
fasts
.
I
admit
it
...
H
'm
...
So
you
want
to
be
a
monk
?
And
do
you
know
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
to
lose
you
,
Alyosha
;
would
you
believe
it
,
I
've
really
grown
*NL*
fond
of
you
?
Well
,
it
's
a
good
opportunity
.
You
'll
pray
for
us
sinners
;
we
*NL*
have
sinned
too
much
here
.
I
've
always
been
thinking
who
would
pray
for
*NL*
me
,
and
whether
there
's
any
one
in
the
world
to
do
it
.
My
dear
boy
,
I
'm
*NL*
awfully
stupid
about
that
.
You
would
n't
believe
it
.
Awfully
.
You
see
,
*NL*
however
stupid
I
am
about
it
,
I
keep
thinking
,
I
keep
thinking
--
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
of
course
,
not
all
the
while
.
It
's
impossible
,
I
think
,
for
the
*NL*
devils
to
forget
to
drag
me
down
to
hell
with
their
hooks
when
I
die
.
Then
*NL*
I
wonder
--
hooks
?
Where
would
they
get
them
?
What
of
?
Iron
hooks
?
Where
do
*NL*
they
forge
them
?
Have
they
a
foundry
there
of
some
sort
?
The
monks
in
the
*NL*
monastery
probably
believe
that
there
's
a
ceiling
in
hell
,
for
instance
.
*NL*
Now
I
'm
ready
to
believe
in
hell
,
but
without
a
ceiling
.
It
makes
it
more
*NL*
refined
,
more
enlightened
,
more
Lutheran
that
is
.
And
,
after
all
,
what
*NL*
does
it
matter
whether
it
has
a
ceiling
or
has
n't
?
But
,
do
you
know
,
*NL*
there
's
a
damnable
question
involved
in
it
?
If
there
's
no
ceiling
there
*NL*
can
be
no
hooks
,
and
if
there
are
no
hooks
it
all
breaks
down
,
which
is
*NL*
unlikely
again
,
for
then
there
would
be
none
to
drag
me
down
to
hell
,
and
*NL*
if
they
do
n't
drag
me
down
what
justice
is
there
in
the
world
?
_
Il
*NL*
faudrait
les
inventer
_
,
those
hooks
,
on
purpose
for
me
alone
,
for
,
if
you
*NL*
only
knew
,
Alyosha
,
what
a
blackguard
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
are
no
hooks
there
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
looking
gently
and
seriously
*NL*
at
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
only
the
shadows
of
hooks
,
I
know
,
I
know
.
That
's
how
a
*NL*
Frenchman
described
hell
:
'
_
J'ai
bu
l'ombre
d'un
cocher
qui
avec
l'ombre
*NL*
d'une
brosse
frottait
l'ombre
d'une
carrosse
.
_
'
How
do
you
know
there
are
*NL*
no
hooks
,
darling
?
When
you
've
lived
with
the
monks
you
'll
sing
a
*NL*
different
tune
.
But
go
and
get
at
the
truth
there
,
and
then
come
and
tell
*NL*
me
.
Anyway
it
's
easier
going
to
the
other
world
if
one
knows
what
there
is
*NL*
there
.
Besides
,
it
will
be
more
seemly
for
you
with
the
monks
than
here
*NL*
with
me
,
with
a
drunken
old
man
and
young
harlots
...
though
you
're
like
*NL*
an
angel
,
nothing
touches
you
.
And
I
dare
say
nothing
will
touch
you
*NL*
there
.
That
's
why
I
let
you
go
,
because
I
hope
for
that
.
You
've
got
all
*NL*
your
wits
about
you
.
You
will
burn
and
you
will
burn
out
;
you
will
be
*NL*
healed
and
come
back
again
.
And
I
will
wait
for
you
.
I
feel
that
you
're
*NL*
the
only
creature
in
the
world
who
has
not
condemned
me
.
My
dear
boy
,
I
*NL*
feel
it
,
you
know
.
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
even
began
blubbering
.
He
was
sentimental
.
He
was
wicked
and
*NL*
sentimental
.

Chapter
V.
Elders
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
my
readers
may
imagine
that
my
young
man
was
a
sickly
,
ecstatic
,
*NL*
poorly
developed
creature
,
a
pale
,
consumptive
dreamer
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
Alyosha
was
at
this
time
a
well-grown
,
red-cheeked
,
clear-eyed
lad
of
*NL*
nineteen
,
radiant
with
health
.
He
was
very
handsome
,
too
,
graceful
,
*NL*
moderately
tall
,
with
hair
of
a
dark
brown
,
with
a
regular
,
rather
long
,
*NL*
oval-shaped
face
,
and
wide-set
dark
gray
,
shining
eyes
;
he
was
very
*NL*
thoughtful
,
and
apparently
very
serene
.
I
shall
be
told
,
perhaps
,
that
red
*NL*
cheeks
are
not
incompatible
with
fanaticism
and
mysticism
;
but
I
fancy
*NL*
that
Alyosha
was
more
of
a
realist
than
any
one
.
Oh
!
no
doubt
,
in
the
*NL*
monastery
he
fully
believed
in
miracles
,
but
,
to
my
thinking
,
miracles
are
*NL*
never
a
stumbling-block
to
the
realist
.
It
is
not
miracles
that
dispose
*NL*
realists
to
belief
.
The
genuine
realist
,
if
he
is
an
unbeliever
,
will
*NL*
always
find
strength
and
ability
to
disbelieve
in
the
miraculous
,
and
if
*NL*
he
is
confronted
with
a
miracle
as
an
irrefutable
fact
he
would
rather
*NL*
disbelieve
his
own
senses
than
admit
the
fact
.
Even
if
he
admits
it
,
he
*NL*
admits
it
as
a
fact
of
nature
till
then
unrecognized
by
him
.
Faith
does
*NL*
not
,
in
the
realist
,
spring
from
the
miracle
but
the
miracle
from
faith
.
*NL*
If
the
realist
once
believes
,
then
he
is
bound
by
his
very
realism
to
*NL*
admit
the
miraculous
also
.
The
Apostle
Thomas
said
that
he
would
not
*NL*
believe
till
he
saw
,
but
when
he
did
see
he
said
,
``
My
Lord
and
my
God
!
''
*NL*
Was
it
the
miracle
forced
him
to
believe
?
Most
likely
not
,
but
he
believed
*NL*
solely
because
he
desired
to
believe
and
possibly
he
fully
believed
in
his
*NL*
secret
heart
even
when
he
said
,
``
I
do
not
believe
till
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
be
told
,
perhaps
,
that
Alyosha
was
stupid
,
undeveloped
,
had
not
*NL*
finished
his
studies
,
and
so
on
.
That
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
is
*NL*
true
,
but
to
say
that
he
was
stupid
or
dull
would
be
a
great
injustice
.
*NL*
I
'll
simply
repeat
what
I
have
said
above
.
He
entered
upon
this
path
only
*NL*
because
,
at
that
time
,
it
alone
struck
his
imagination
and
presented
*NL*
itself
to
him
as
offering
an
ideal
means
of
escape
for
his
soul
from
*NL*
darkness
to
light
.
Add
to
that
that
he
was
to
some
extent
a
youth
of
our
*NL*
last
epoch
--
that
is
,
honest
in
nature
,
desiring
the
truth
,
seeking
for
it
*NL*
and
believing
in
it
,
and
seeking
to
serve
it
at
once
with
all
the
strength
*NL*
of
his
soul
,
seeking
for
immediate
action
,
and
ready
to
sacrifice
*NL*
everything
,
life
itself
,
for
it
.
Though
these
young
men
unhappily
fail
to
*NL*
understand
that
the
sacrifice
of
life
is
,
in
many
cases
,
the
easiest
of
*NL*
all
sacrifices
,
and
that
to
sacrifice
,
for
instance
,
five
or
six
years
of
*NL*
their
seething
youth
to
hard
and
tedious
study
,
if
only
to
multiply
*NL*
tenfold
their
powers
of
serving
the
truth
and
the
cause
they
have
set
*NL*
before
them
as
their
goal
--
such
a
sacrifice
is
utterly
beyond
the
strength
*NL*
of
many
of
them
.
The
path
Alyosha
chose
was
a
path
going
in
the
opposite
*NL*
direction
,
but
he
chose
it
with
the
same
thirst
for
swift
achievement
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
reflected
seriously
he
was
convinced
of
the
existence
of
God
*NL*
and
immortality
,
and
at
once
he
instinctively
said
to
himself
:
``
I
want
to
*NL*
live
for
immortality
,
and
I
will
accept
no
compromise
.
''
In
the
same
way
,
*NL*
if
he
had
decided
that
God
and
immortality
did
not
exist
,
he
would
at
once
*NL*
have
become
an
atheist
and
a
socialist
.
For
socialism
is
not
merely
the
*NL*
labor
question
,
it
is
before
all
things
the
atheistic
question
,
the
*NL*
question
of
the
form
taken
by
atheism
to-day
,
the
question
of
the
tower
of
*NL*
Babel
built
without
God
,
not
to
mount
to
heaven
from
earth
but
to
set
up
*NL*
heaven
on
earth
.
Alyosha
would
have
found
it
strange
and
impossible
to
go
*NL*
on
living
as
before
.
It
is
written
:
``
Give
all
that
thou
hast
to
the
poor
*NL*
and
follow
Me
,
if
thou
wouldst
be
perfect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
said
to
himself
:
``
I
ca
n't
give
two
roubles
instead
of
`
all
,
'
and
*NL*
only
go
to
mass
instead
of
`
following
Him
.
'
''
Perhaps
his
memories
of
*NL*
childhood
brought
back
our
monastery
,
to
which
his
mother
may
have
taken
*NL*
him
to
mass
.
Perhaps
the
slanting
sunlight
and
the
holy
image
to
which
his
*NL*
poor
``
crazy
''
mother
had
held
him
up
still
acted
upon
his
imagination
.
*NL*
Brooding
on
these
things
he
may
have
come
to
us
perhaps
only
to
see
*NL*
whether
here
he
could
sacrifice
all
or
only
``
two
roubles
,
''
and
in
the
*NL*
monastery
he
met
this
elder
.
I
must
digress
to
explain
what
an
``
elder
''
is
*NL*
in
Russian
monasteries
,
and
I
am
sorry
that
I
do
not
feel
very
competent
*NL*
to
do
so
.
I
will
try
,
however
,
to
give
a
superficial
account
of
it
in
a
*NL*
few
words
.
Authorities
on
the
subject
assert
that
the
institution
of
*NL*
``
elders
''
is
of
recent
date
,
not
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
in
our
*NL*
monasteries
,
though
in
the
orthodox
East
,
especially
in
Sinai
and
Athos
,
*NL*
it
has
existed
over
a
thousand
years
.
It
is
maintained
that
it
existed
in
*NL*
ancient
times
in
Russia
also
,
but
through
the
calamities
which
overtook
*NL*
Russia
--
the
Tartars
,
civil
war
,
the
interruption
of
relations
with
the
East
*NL*
after
the
destruction
of
Constantinople
--
this
institution
fell
into
*NL*
oblivion
.
It
was
revived
among
us
towards
the
end
of
last
century
by
one
*NL*
of
the
great
``
ascetics
,
''
as
they
called
him
,
Paissy
Velitchkovsky
,
and
his
*NL*
disciples
.
But
to
this
day
it
exists
in
few
monasteries
only
,
and
has
*NL*
sometimes
been
almost
persecuted
as
an
innovation
in
Russia
.
It
flourished
*NL*
especially
in
the
celebrated
Kozelski
Optin
Monastery
.
When
and
how
it
was
*NL*
introduced
into
our
monastery
I
can
not
say
.
There
had
already
been
three
*NL*
such
elders
and
Zossima
was
the
last
of
them
.
But
he
was
almost
dying
of
*NL*
weakness
and
disease
,
and
they
had
no
one
to
take
his
place
.
The
question
*NL*
for
our
monastery
was
an
important
one
,
for
it
had
not
been
distinguished
*NL*
by
anything
in
particular
till
then
:
they
had
neither
relics
of
saints
,
*NL*
nor
wonder-working
ikons
,
nor
glorious
traditions
,
nor
historical
*NL*
exploits
.
It
had
flourished
and
been
glorious
all
over
Russia
through
its
*NL*
elders
,
to
see
and
hear
whom
pilgrims
had
flocked
for
thousands
of
miles
*NL*
from
all
parts
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
such
an
elder
?
An
elder
was
one
who
took
your
soul
,
your
will
,
*NL*
into
his
soul
and
his
will
.
When
you
choose
an
elder
,
you
renounce
your
*NL*
own
will
and
yield
it
to
him
in
complete
submission
,
complete
self
-
*NL*
abnegation
.
This
novitiate
,
this
terrible
school
of
abnegation
,
is
*NL*
undertaken
voluntarily
,
in
the
hope
of
self-conquest
,
of
self-mastery
,
in
*NL*
order
,
after
a
life
of
obedience
,
to
attain
perfect
freedom
,
that
is
,
from
*NL*
self
;
to
escape
the
lot
of
those
who
have
lived
their
whole
life
without
*NL*
finding
their
true
selves
in
themselves
.
This
institution
of
elders
is
not
*NL*
founded
on
theory
,
but
was
established
in
the
East
from
the
practice
of
a
*NL*
thousand
years
.
The
obligations
due
to
an
elder
are
not
the
ordinary
*NL*
``
obedience
''
which
has
always
existed
in
our
Russian
monasteries
.
The
*NL*
obligation
involves
confession
to
the
elder
by
all
who
have
submitted
*NL*
themselves
to
him
,
and
to
the
indissoluble
bond
between
him
and
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
is
told
,
for
instance
,
that
in
the
early
days
of
Christianity
*NL*
one
such
novice
,
failing
to
fulfill
some
command
laid
upon
him
by
his
*NL*
elder
,
left
his
monastery
in
Syria
and
went
to
Egypt
.
There
,
after
great
*NL*
exploits
,
he
was
found
worthy
at
last
to
suffer
torture
and
a
martyr
's
*NL*
death
for
the
faith
.
When
the
Church
,
regarding
him
as
a
saint
,
was
*NL*
burying
him
,
suddenly
,
at
the
deacon
's
exhortation
,
``
Depart
all
ye
*NL*
unbaptized
,
''
the
coffin
containing
the
martyr
's
body
left
its
place
and
*NL*
was
cast
forth
from
the
church
,
and
this
took
place
three
times
.
And
only
*NL*
at
last
they
learnt
that
this
holy
man
had
broken
his
vow
of
obedience
and
*NL*
left
his
elder
,
and
,
therefore
,
could
not
be
forgiven
without
the
elder
's
*NL*
absolution
in
spite
of
his
great
deeds
.
Only
after
this
could
the
funeral
*NL*
take
place
.
This
,
of
course
,
is
only
an
old
legend
.
But
here
is
a
recent
*NL*
instance
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
monk
was
suddenly
commanded
by
his
elder
to
quit
Athos
,
which
he
loved
*NL*
as
a
sacred
place
and
a
haven
of
refuge
,
and
to
go
first
to
Jerusalem
to
*NL*
do
homage
to
the
Holy
Places
and
then
to
go
to
the
north
to
Siberia
:
*NL*
``
There
is
the
place
for
thee
and
not
here
.
''
The
monk
,
overwhelmed
with
*NL*
sorrow
,
went
to
the
OEcumenical
Patriarch
at
Constantinople
and
besought
*NL*
him
to
release
him
from
his
obedience
.
But
the
Patriarch
replied
that
not
*NL*
only
was
he
unable
to
release
him
,
but
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
on
*NL*
earth
a
power
which
could
release
him
except
the
elder
who
had
himself
*NL*
laid
that
duty
upon
him
.
In
this
way
the
elders
are
endowed
in
certain
*NL*
cases
with
unbounded
and
inexplicable
authority
.
That
is
why
in
many
of
*NL*
our
monasteries
the
institution
was
at
first
resisted
almost
to
*NL*
persecution
.
Meantime
the
elders
immediately
began
to
be
highly
esteemed
*NL*
among
the
people
.
Masses
of
the
ignorant
people
as
well
as
men
of
*NL*
distinction
flocked
,
for
instance
,
to
the
elders
of
our
monastery
to
*NL*
confess
their
doubts
,
their
sins
,
and
their
sufferings
,
and
ask
for
*NL*
counsel
and
admonition
.
Seeing
this
,
the
opponents
of
the
elders
declared
*NL*
that
the
sacrament
of
confession
was
being
arbitrarily
and
frivolously
*NL*
degraded
,
though
the
continual
opening
of
the
heart
to
the
elder
by
the
*NL*
monk
or
the
layman
had
nothing
of
the
character
of
the
sacrament
.
In
the
*NL*
end
,
however
,
the
institution
of
elders
has
been
retained
and
is
becoming
*NL*
established
in
Russian
monasteries
.
It
is
true
,
perhaps
,
that
this
*NL*
instrument
which
had
stood
the
test
of
a
thousand
years
for
the
moral
*NL*
regeneration
of
a
man
from
slavery
to
freedom
and
to
moral
perfectibility
*NL*
may
be
a
two-edged
weapon
and
it
may
lead
some
not
to
humility
and
*NL*
complete
self-control
but
to
the
most
Satanic
pride
,
that
is
,
to
bondage
*NL*
and
not
to
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
Zossima
was
sixty-five
.
He
came
of
a
family
of
landowners
,
had
*NL*
been
in
the
army
in
early
youth
,
and
served
in
the
Caucasus
as
an
officer
.
*NL*
He
had
,
no
doubt
,
impressed
Alyosha
by
some
peculiar
quality
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
Alyosha
lived
in
the
cell
of
the
elder
,
who
was
very
fond
of
him
and
let
*NL*
him
wait
upon
him
.
It
must
be
noted
that
Alyosha
was
bound
by
no
*NL*
obligation
and
could
go
where
he
pleased
and
be
absent
for
whole
days
.
*NL*
Though
he
wore
the
monastic
dress
it
was
voluntarily
,
not
to
be
different
*NL*
from
others
.
No
doubt
he
liked
to
do
so
.
Possibly
his
youthful
imagination
*NL*
was
deeply
stirred
by
the
power
and
fame
of
his
elder
.
It
was
said
that
so
*NL*
many
people
had
for
years
past
come
to
confess
their
sins
to
Father
*NL*
Zossima
and
to
entreat
him
for
words
of
advice
and
healing
,
that
he
had
*NL*
acquired
the
keenest
intuition
and
could
tell
from
an
unknown
face
what
a
*NL*
new-comer
wanted
,
and
what
was
the
suffering
on
his
conscience
.
He
*NL*
sometimes
astounded
and
almost
alarmed
his
visitors
by
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
their
secrets
before
they
had
spoken
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
noticed
that
many
,
almost
all
,
went
in
to
the
elder
for
the
first
*NL*
time
with
apprehension
and
uneasiness
,
but
came
out
with
bright
and
happy
*NL*
faces
.
Alyosha
was
particularly
struck
by
the
fact
that
Father
Zossima
was
*NL*
not
at
all
stern
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
always
almost
gay
.
The
monks
*NL*
used
to
say
that
he
was
more
drawn
to
those
who
were
more
sinful
,
and
the
*NL*
greater
the
sinner
the
more
he
loved
him
.
There
were
,
no
doubt
,
up
to
the
*NL*
end
of
his
life
,
among
the
monks
some
who
hated
and
envied
him
,
but
they
*NL*
were
few
in
number
and
they
were
silent
,
though
among
them
were
some
of
*NL*
great
dignity
in
the
monastery
,
one
,
for
instance
,
of
the
older
monks
*NL*
distinguished
for
his
strict
keeping
of
fasts
and
vows
of
silence
.
But
the
*NL*
majority
were
on
Father
Zossima
's
side
and
very
many
of
them
loved
him
*NL*
with
all
their
hearts
,
warmly
and
sincerely
.
Some
were
almost
fanatically
*NL*
devoted
to
him
,
and
declared
,
though
not
quite
aloud
,
that
he
was
a
saint
,
*NL*
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
,
and
,
seeing
that
his
end
was
near
,
*NL*
they
anticipated
miracles
and
great
glory
to
the
monastery
in
the
*NL*
immediate
future
from
his
relics
.
Alyosha
had
unquestioning
faith
in
the
*NL*
miraculous
power
of
the
elder
,
just
as
he
had
unquestioning
faith
in
the
*NL*
story
of
the
coffin
that
flew
out
of
the
church
.
He
saw
many
who
came
with
*NL*
sick
children
or
relatives
and
besought
the
elder
to
lay
hands
on
them
and
*NL*
to
pray
over
them
,
return
shortly
after
--
some
the
next
day
--
and
,
falling
in
*NL*
tears
at
the
elder
's
feet
,
thank
him
for
healing
their
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
they
had
really
been
healed
or
were
simply
better
in
the
natural
*NL*
course
of
the
disease
was
a
question
which
did
not
exist
for
Alyosha
,
for
*NL*
he
fully
believed
in
the
spiritual
power
of
his
teacher
and
rejoiced
in
*NL*
his
fame
,
in
his
glory
,
as
though
it
were
his
own
triumph
.
His
heart
*NL*
throbbed
,
and
he
beamed
,
as
it
were
,
all
over
when
the
elder
came
out
to
*NL*
the
gates
of
the
hermitage
into
the
waiting
crowd
of
pilgrims
of
the
*NL*
humbler
class
who
had
flocked
from
all
parts
of
Russia
on
purpose
to
see
*NL*
the
elder
and
obtain
his
blessing
.
They
fell
down
before
him
,
wept
,
kissed
*NL*
his
feet
,
kissed
the
earth
on
which
he
stood
,
and
wailed
,
while
the
women
*NL*
held
up
their
children
to
him
and
brought
him
the
sick
``
possessed
with
*NL*
devils
.
''
The
elder
spoke
to
them
,
read
a
brief
prayer
over
them
,
blessed
*NL*
them
,
and
dismissed
them
.
Of
late
he
had
become
so
weak
through
attacks
of
*NL*
illness
that
he
was
sometimes
unable
to
leave
his
cell
,
and
the
pilgrims
*NL*
waited
for
him
to
come
out
for
several
days
.
Alyosha
did
not
wonder
why
*NL*
they
loved
him
so
,
why
they
fell
down
before
him
and
wept
with
emotion
*NL*
merely
at
seeing
his
face
.
Oh
!
he
understood
that
for
the
humble
soul
of
*NL*
the
Russian
peasant
,
worn
out
by
grief
and
toil
,
and
still
more
by
the
*NL*
everlasting
injustice
and
everlasting
sin
,
his
own
and
the
world
's
,
it
was
*NL*
the
greatest
need
and
comfort
to
find
some
one
or
something
holy
to
fall
*NL*
down
before
and
worship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among
us
there
is
sin
,
injustice
,
and
temptation
,
but
yet
,
somewhere
on
*NL*
earth
there
is
some
one
holy
and
exalted
.
He
has
the
truth
;
he
knows
the
*NL*
truth
;
so
it
is
not
dead
upon
the
earth
;
so
it
will
come
one
day
to
us
,
*NL*
too
,
and
rule
over
all
the
earth
according
to
the
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
knew
that
this
was
just
how
the
people
felt
and
even
reasoned
.
He
*NL*
understood
it
,
but
that
the
elder
Zossima
was
this
saint
and
custodian
of
*NL*
God
's
truth
--
of
that
he
had
no
more
doubt
than
the
weeping
peasants
and
the
*NL*
sick
women
who
held
out
their
children
to
the
elder
.
The
conviction
that
*NL*
after
his
death
the
elder
would
bring
extraordinary
glory
to
the
monastery
*NL*
was
even
stronger
in
Alyosha
than
in
any
one
there
,
and
,
of
late
,
a
kind
*NL*
of
deep
flame
of
inner
ecstasy
burnt
more
and
more
strongly
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
He
was
not
at
all
troubled
at
this
elder
's
standing
as
a
solitary
example
*NL*
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
.
He
is
holy
.
He
carries
in
his
heart
the
secret
of
renewal
for
*NL*
all
:
that
power
which
will
,
at
last
,
establish
truth
on
the
earth
,
and
all
*NL*
men
will
be
holy
and
love
one
another
,
and
there
will
be
no
more
rich
nor
*NL*
poor
,
no
exalted
nor
humbled
,
but
all
will
be
as
the
children
of
God
,
and
*NL*
the
true
Kingdom
of
Christ
will
come
.
''
That
was
the
dream
in
Alyosha
's
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
his
two
brothers
,
whom
he
had
not
known
till
then
,
seemed
*NL*
to
make
a
great
impression
on
Alyosha
.
He
more
quickly
made
friends
with
*NL*
his
half-brother
Dmitri
-LRB-
though
he
arrived
later
-RRB-
than
with
his
own
*NL*
brother
Ivan
.
He
was
extremely
interested
in
his
brother
Ivan
,
but
when
*NL*
the
latter
had
been
two
months
in
the
town
,
though
they
had
met
fairly
*NL*
often
,
they
were
still
not
intimate
.
Alyosha
was
naturally
silent
,
and
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
,
ashamed
about
something
,
while
his
*NL*
brother
Ivan
,
though
Alyosha
noticed
at
first
that
he
looked
long
and
*NL*
curiously
at
him
,
seemed
soon
to
have
left
off
thinking
of
him
.
Alyosha
*NL*
noticed
it
with
some
embarrassment
.
He
ascribed
his
brother
's
indifference
*NL*
at
first
to
the
disparity
of
their
age
and
education
.
But
he
also
wondered
*NL*
whether
the
absence
of
curiosity
and
sympathy
in
Ivan
might
be
due
to
some
*NL*
other
cause
entirely
unknown
to
him
.
He
kept
fancying
that
Ivan
was
*NL*
absorbed
in
something
--
something
inward
and
important
--
that
he
was
striving
*NL*
towards
some
goal
,
perhaps
very
hard
to
attain
,
and
that
that
was
why
he
*NL*
had
no
thought
for
him
.
Alyosha
wondered
,
too
,
whether
there
was
not
some
*NL*
contempt
on
the
part
of
the
learned
atheist
for
him
--
a
foolish
novice
.
He
*NL*
knew
for
certain
that
his
brother
was
an
atheist
.
He
could
not
take
*NL*
offense
at
this
contempt
,
if
it
existed
;
yet
,
with
an
uneasy
embarrassment
*NL*
which
he
did
not
himself
understand
,
he
waited
for
his
brother
to
come
*NL*
nearer
to
him
.
Dmitri
used
to
speak
of
Ivan
with
the
deepest
respect
and
*NL*
with
a
peculiar
earnestness
.
From
him
Alyosha
learnt
all
the
details
of
*NL*
the
important
affair
which
had
of
late
formed
such
a
close
and
remarkable
*NL*
bond
between
the
two
elder
brothers
.
Dmitri
's
enthusiastic
references
to
*NL*
Ivan
were
the
more
striking
in
Alyosha
's
eyes
since
Dmitri
was
,
compared
*NL*
with
Ivan
,
almost
uneducated
,
and
the
two
brothers
were
such
a
contrast
in
*NL*
personality
and
character
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
men
more
*NL*
unlike
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
time
that
the
meeting
,
or
,
rather
gathering
of
the
members
*NL*
of
this
inharmonious
family
took
place
in
the
cell
of
the
elder
who
had
*NL*
such
an
extraordinary
influence
on
Alyosha
.
The
pretext
for
this
gathering
*NL*
was
a
false
one
.
It
was
at
this
time
that
the
discord
between
Dmitri
and
*NL*
his
father
seemed
at
its
acutest
stage
and
their
relations
had
become
*NL*
insufferably
strained
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
*NL*
suggest
,
apparently
in
joke
,
that
they
should
all
meet
in
Father
Zossima
's
*NL*
cell
,
and
that
,
without
appealing
to
his
direct
intervention
,
they
might
*NL*
more
decently
come
to
an
understanding
under
the
conciliating
influence
of
*NL*
the
elder
's
presence
.
Dmitri
,
who
had
never
seen
the
elder
,
naturally
*NL*
supposed
that
his
father
was
trying
to
intimidate
him
,
but
,
as
he
secretly
*NL*
blamed
himself
for
his
outbursts
of
temper
with
his
father
on
several
*NL*
recent
occasions
,
he
accepted
the
challenge
.
It
must
be
noted
that
he
was
*NL*
not
,
like
Ivan
,
staying
with
his
father
,
but
living
apart
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
town
.
It
happened
that
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
Miuesov
,
who
was
staying
*NL*
in
the
district
at
the
time
,
caught
eagerly
at
the
idea
.
A
Liberal
of
the
*NL*
forties
and
fifties
,
a
freethinker
and
atheist
,
he
may
have
been
led
on
by
*NL*
boredom
or
the
hope
of
frivolous
diversion
.
He
was
suddenly
seized
with
*NL*
the
desire
to
see
the
monastery
and
the
holy
man
.
As
his
lawsuit
with
the
*NL*
monastery
still
dragged
on
,
he
made
it
the
pretext
for
seeing
the
*NL*
Superior
,
in
order
to
attempt
to
settle
it
amicably
.
A
visitor
coming
with
*NL*
such
laudable
intentions
might
be
received
with
more
attention
and
*NL*
consideration
than
if
he
came
from
simple
curiosity
.
Influences
from
*NL*
within
the
monastery
were
brought
to
bear
on
the
elder
,
who
of
late
had
*NL*
scarcely
left
his
cell
,
and
had
been
forced
by
illness
to
deny
even
his
*NL*
ordinary
visitors
.
In
the
end
he
consented
to
see
them
,
and
the
day
was
*NL*
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
made
me
a
judge
over
them
?
''
was
all
he
said
,
smilingly
,
to
*NL*
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
much
perturbed
when
he
heard
of
the
proposed
visit
.
Of
all
the
*NL*
wrangling
,
quarrelsome
party
,
Dmitri
was
the
only
one
who
could
regard
the
*NL*
interview
seriously
.
All
the
others
would
come
from
frivolous
motives
,
*NL*
perhaps
insulting
to
the
elder
.
Alyosha
was
well
aware
of
that
.
Ivan
and
*NL*
Miuesov
would
come
from
curiosity
,
perhaps
of
the
coarsest
kind
,
while
his
*NL*
father
might
be
contemplating
some
piece
of
buffoonery
.
Though
he
said
*NL*
nothing
,
Alyosha
thoroughly
understood
his
father
.
The
boy
,
I
repeat
,
was
*NL*
far
from
being
so
simple
as
every
one
thought
him
.
He
awaited
the
day
with
*NL*
a
heavy
heart
.
No
doubt
he
was
always
pondering
in
his
mind
how
the
family
*NL*
discord
could
be
ended
.
But
his
chief
anxiety
concerned
the
elder
.
He
*NL*
trembled
for
him
,
for
his
glory
,
and
dreaded
any
affront
to
him
,
*NL*
especially
the
refined
,
courteous
irony
of
Miuesov
and
the
supercilious
*NL*
half-utterances
of
the
highly
educated
Ivan
.
He
even
wanted
to
venture
on
*NL*
warning
the
elder
,
telling
him
something
about
them
,
but
,
on
second
*NL*
thoughts
,
said
nothing
.
He
only
sent
word
the
day
before
,
through
a
*NL*
friend
,
to
his
brother
Dmitri
,
that
he
loved
him
and
expected
him
to
keep
*NL*
his
promise
.
Dmitri
wondered
,
for
he
could
not
remember
what
he
had
*NL*
promised
,
but
he
answered
by
letter
that
he
would
do
his
utmost
not
to
let
*NL*
himself
be
provoked
``
by
vileness
,
''
but
that
,
although
he
had
a
deep
*NL*
respect
for
the
elder
and
for
his
brother
Ivan
,
he
was
convinced
that
the
*NL*
meeting
was
either
a
trap
for
him
or
an
unworthy
farce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
I
would
rather
bite
out
my
tongue
than
be
lacking
in
respect
*NL*
to
the
sainted
man
whom
you
reverence
so
highly
,
''
he
wrote
in
conclusion
.
*NL*
Alyosha
was
not
greatly
cheered
by
the
letter
.

Chapter

They
Arrive
At
The
Monastery
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
,
bright
day
at
the
end
of
August
.
The
interview
with
the
*NL*
elder
had
been
fixed
for
half-past
eleven
,
immediately
after
late
mass
.
*NL*
Our
visitors
did
not
take
part
in
the
service
,
but
arrived
just
as
it
was
*NL*
over
.
First
an
elegant
open
carriage
,
drawn
by
two
valuable
horses
,
drove
*NL*
up
with
Miuesov
and
a
distant
relative
of
his
,
a
young
man
of
twenty
,
*NL*
called
Pyotr
Fomitch
Kalganov
.
This
young
man
was
preparing
to
enter
the
*NL*
university
.
Miuesov
,
with
whom
he
was
staying
for
the
time
,
was
trying
to
*NL*
persuade
him
to
go
abroad
to
the
university
of
Zurich
or
Jena
.
The
young
*NL*
man
was
still
undecided
.
He
was
thoughtful
and
absent-minded
.
He
was
nice
-
*NL*
looking
,
strongly
built
,
and
rather
tall
.
There
was
a
strange
fixity
in
*NL*
his
gaze
at
times
.
Like
all
very
absent-minded
people
he
would
sometimes
*NL*
stare
at
a
person
without
seeing
him
.
He
was
silent
and
rather
awkward
,
*NL*
but
sometimes
,
when
he
was
alone
with
any
one
,
he
became
talkative
and
*NL*
effusive
,
and
would
laugh
at
anything
or
nothing
.
But
his
animation
*NL*
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
.
He
was
always
well
and
even
*NL*
elaborately
dressed
;
he
had
already
some
independent
fortune
and
*NL*
expectations
of
much
more
.
He
was
a
friend
of
Alyosha
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
ancient
,
jolting
,
but
roomy
,
hired
carriage
,
with
a
pair
of
old
*NL*
pinkish-gray
horses
,
a
long
way
behind
Miuesov
's
carriage
,
came
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
with
his
son
Ivan
.
Dmitri
was
late
,
though
he
had
been
*NL*
informed
of
the
time
the
evening
before
.
The
visitors
left
their
carriage
*NL*
at
the
hotel
,
outside
the
precincts
,
and
went
to
the
gates
of
the
*NL*
monastery
on
foot
.
Except
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
none
of
the
party
had
ever
*NL*
seen
the
monastery
,
and
Miuesov
had
probably
not
even
been
to
church
for
*NL*
thirty
years
.
He
looked
about
him
with
curiosity
,
together
with
assumed
*NL*
ease
.
But
,
except
the
church
and
the
domestic
buildings
,
though
these
too
*NL*
were
ordinary
enough
,
he
found
nothing
of
interest
in
the
interior
of
the
*NL*
monastery
.
The
last
of
the
worshippers
were
coming
out
of
the
church
,
*NL*
bareheaded
and
crossing
themselves
.
Among
the
humbler
people
were
a
few
of
*NL*
higher
rank
--
two
or
three
ladies
and
a
very
old
general
.
They
were
all
*NL*
staying
at
the
hotel
.
Our
visitors
were
at
once
surrounded
by
beggars
,
but
*NL*
none
of
them
gave
them
anything
,
except
young
Kalganov
,
who
took
a
ten
-
*NL*
copeck
piece
out
of
his
purse
,
and
,
nervous
and
embarrassed
--
God
knows
*NL*
why
!
--
hurriedly
gave
it
to
an
old
woman
,
saying
:
``
Divide
it
equally
.
''
None
*NL*
of
his
companions
made
any
remark
upon
it
,
so
that
he
had
no
reason
to
be
*NL*
embarrassed
;
but
,
perceiving
this
,
he
was
even
more
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
strange
that
their
arrival
did
not
seem
expected
,
and
that
they
*NL*
were
not
received
with
special
honor
,
though
one
of
them
had
recently
made
*NL*
a
donation
of
a
thousand
roubles
,
while
another
was
a
very
wealthy
and
*NL*
highly
cultured
landowner
,
upon
whom
all
in
the
monastery
were
in
a
sense
*NL*
dependent
,
as
a
decision
of
the
lawsuit
might
at
any
moment
put
their
*NL*
fishing
rights
in
his
hands
.
Yet
no
official
personage
met
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miuesov
looked
absent-mindedly
at
the
tombstones
round
the
church
,
and
was
*NL*
on
the
point
of
saying
that
the
dead
buried
here
must
have
paid
a
pretty
*NL*
penny
for
the
right
of
lying
in
this
``
holy
place
,
''
but
refrained
.
His
*NL*
liberal
irony
was
rapidly
changing
almost
into
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
the
devil
is
there
to
ask
in
this
imbecile
place
?
We
must
find
out
,
*NL*
for
time
is
passing
,
''
he
observed
suddenly
,
as
though
speaking
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
there
came
up
a
bald-headed
,
elderly
man
with
ingratiating
*NL*
little
eyes
,
wearing
a
full
,
summer
overcoat
.
Lifting
his
hat
,
he
*NL*
introduced
himself
with
a
honeyed
lisp
as
Maximov
,
a
landowner
of
Tula
.
He
*NL*
at
once
entered
into
our
visitors
'
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Zossima
lives
in
the
hermitage
,
apart
,
four
hundred
paces
from
the
*NL*
monastery
,
the
other
side
of
the
copse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
's
the
other
side
of
the
copse
,
''
observed
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
*NL*
``
but
we
do
n't
remember
the
way
.
It
is
a
long
time
since
we
've
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
by
this
gate
,
and
straight
across
the
copse
...
the
copse
.
Come
*NL*
with
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
I
'll
show
you
.
I
have
to
go
...
I
am
going
myself
.
*NL*
This
way
,
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
out
of
the
gate
and
turned
towards
the
copse
.
Maximov
,
a
man
of
*NL*
sixty
,
ran
rather
than
walked
,
turning
sideways
to
stare
at
them
all
,
with
*NL*
an
incredible
degree
of
nervous
curiosity
.
His
eyes
looked
starting
out
of
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
we
have
come
to
the
elder
upon
business
of
our
own
,
''
observed
*NL*
Miuesov
severely
.
``
That
personage
has
granted
us
an
audience
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
and
so
,
though
we
thank
you
for
showing
us
the
way
,
we
can
not
ask
you
to
*NL*
accompany
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
there
.
I
've
been
already
;
_
un
chevalier
parfait
_
,
''
and
Maximov
*NL*
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
a
_
chevalier
_
?
''
asked
Miuesov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
elder
,
the
splendid
elder
,
the
elder
!
The
honor
and
glory
of
the
*NL*
monastery
,
Zossima
.
Such
an
elder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
incoherent
talk
was
cut
short
by
a
very
pale
,
wan-looking
monk
of
*NL*
medium
height
,
wearing
a
monk
's
cap
,
who
overtook
them
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
and
Miuesov
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monk
,
with
an
extremely
courteous
,
profound
bow
,
announced
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Father
Superior
invites
all
of
you
gentlemen
to
dine
with
him
after
*NL*
your
visit
to
the
hermitage
.
At
one
o'clock
,
not
later
.
And
you
also
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
addressing
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
certainly
will
,
without
fail
,
''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
hugely
*NL*
delighted
at
the
invitation
.
``
And
,
believe
me
,
we
've
all
given
our
word
to

behave
properly
here

you

Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
,
will
you
go
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course

What
have
I
come
for
but
to
study
all
the
customs
here
?

The
only
obstacle
to
me
is
your
company

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

non-existent

yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
capital
thing
if
he
did
n't
turn
up

you
suppose

like

all
this
business

and
in
your
company

too

So
we
will
come
to
dinner

*NL*
Thank

he
said
to
the
monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
is
my
duty
now
to
conduct
you
to

answered
the
monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
I
'll
go
straight
to
the
Father
Superior

to
the
Father
Superior

*NL*
babbled
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Father
Superior
is
engaged
just
now

But
as
you
please

''
the
monk
*NL*
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impertinent
old
man
!
''
Miuesov
observed
aloud
,
while
Maximov
ran
back
to
*NL*
the
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
like
von

Fyodor
Pavlovitch
said
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
you
can
think
of
?

In
what
way
is
he
like
von
Sohn
?
Have
*NL*
you
ever
seen
von
Sohn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
his
portrait
.
It
's
not
the
features
,
but
something
indefinable
.
*NL*
He
's
a
second
von
Sohn
.
I
can
always
tell
from
the
physiognomy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
dare
say
you
are
a
connoisseur
in
that
.
But
,
look
here
,
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
you
said
just
now
that
we
had
given
our
word
to
behave
*NL*
properly
.
Remember
it
.
I
advise
you
to
control
yourself
.
But
,
if
you
begin
*NL*
to
play
the
fool
I
do
n't
intend
to
be
associated
with
you
here
...
You
see
*NL*
what
a
man
he
is
''
--
he
turned
to
the
monk
--
``
I
'm
afraid
to
go
among
decent
*NL*
people
with
him
.
''
A
fine
smile
,
not
without
a
certain
slyness
,
came
on
to
*NL*
the
pale
,
bloodless
lips
of
the
monk
,
but
he
made
no
reply
,
and
was
*NL*
evidently
silent
from
a
sense
of
his
own
dignity
.
Miuesov
frowned
more
than
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
devil
take
them
all
!
An
outer
show
elaborated
through
centuries
,
and
*NL*
nothing
but
charlatanism
and
nonsense
underneath
,
''
flashed
through
*NL*
Miuesov
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
hermitage
.
We
've
arrived
,
''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
``
The
gates
*NL*
are
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
repeatedly
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
the
saints
painted
above
*NL*
and
on
the
sides
of
the
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
go
to
Rome
you
must
do
as
the
Romans
do
.
Here
in
this
hermitage
*NL*
there
are
twenty-five
saints
being
saved
.
They
look
at
one
another
,
and
*NL*
eat
cabbages
.
And
not
one
woman
goes
in
at
this
gate
.
That
's
what
is
*NL*
remarkable
.
And
that
really
is
so
.
But
I
did
hear
that
the
elder
receives
*NL*
ladies
,
''
he
remarked
suddenly
to
the
monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
of
the
people
are
here
too
now
,
lying
in
the
portico
there
waiting
.
*NL*
But
for
ladies
of
higher
rank
two
rooms
have
been
built
adjoining
the
*NL*
portico
,
but
outside
the
precincts
--
you
can
see
the
windows
--
and
the
elder
*NL*
goes
out
to
them
by
an
inner
passage
when
he
is
well
enough
.
They
are
*NL*
always
outside
the
precincts
.
There
is
a
Harkov
lady
,
Madame
Hohlakov
,
*NL*
waiting
there
now
with
her
sick
daughter
.
Probably
he
has
promised
to
come
*NL*
out
to
her
,
though
of
late
he
has
been
so
weak
that
he
has
hardly
shown
*NL*
himself
even
to
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
there
are
loopholes
,
after
all
,
to
creep
out
of
the
hermitage
to
*NL*
the
ladies
.
Do
n't
suppose
,
holy
father
,
that
I
mean
any
harm
.
But
do
you
*NL*
know
that
at
Athos
not
only
the
visits
of
women
are
not
allowed
,
but
no
*NL*
creature
of
the
female
sex

no
hens
,
nor
turkey-hens
,
nor
cows

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
I
warn
you
I
shall
go
back

leave
you
here

They

you
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I

not

with
you

Pyotr

Look

''
he
cried
*NL*
suddenly
,
stepping
within
the
precincts
,
``
what
a
vale
of
roses
they
live
*NL*
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
were
no
roses
now
,
there
were
numbers
of
rare
and
beautiful
*NL*
autumn
flowers
growing
wherever
there
was
space
for
them
,
and
evidently
*NL*
tended
by
a
skillful
hand
;
there
were
flower-beds
round
the
church
,
and
*NL*
between
the
tombs
;
and
the
one-storied
wooden
house
where
the
elder
lived
*NL*
was
also
surrounded
with
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
it
like
this
in
the
time
of
the
last
elder
,
Varsonofy
?
He
did
n't
*NL*
care
for
such
elegance
.
They
say
he
used
to
jump
up
and
thrash
even
ladies
*NL*
with
a
stick
,

observed
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
as
he
went
up
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
elder
Varsonofy
did
sometimes
seem
rather
strange
,
but
a
great
deal
*NL*
that
's
told
is
foolishness

He
never
thrashed
any
one

answered
the
monk
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
I
will
announce
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fyodor

you
hear

Behave
*NL*
properly

I
will
pay
you
out

Miuesov
had
time
to
mutter
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
think
why
you
are
so
agitated

''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
observed
*NL*
sarcastically
.
``
Are
you
uneasy
about
your
sins

They
say
he
can
tell
by

one

eyes
what

come
about

And
what
a

you

so
advanced

I
'm
surprised

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miuesov
had
no
time
to
reply
to
this
sarcasm
.
They
were
asked
to
come
*NL*
in
.
He
walked
in
,
somewhat
irritated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
know
myself
,
I
am
annoyed

I
shall
lose
my

reflected

Chapter
II
.
The
Old
Buffoon
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
elder
came
in
*NL*
from
his
bedroom
.
There
were
already
in
the
cell
,
awaiting
the
elder
,
two
*NL*
monks
of
the
hermitage
,
one
the
Father
Librarian
,
and
the
other
Father
*NL*
Paissy
,
a
very
learned
man
,
so
they
said
,
in
delicate
health
,
though
not
*NL*
old
.
There
was
also
a
tall
young
man
,
who
looked
about
two
and
twenty
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
corner
throughout
the
interview
.
He
had
a
broad
,
fresh
*NL*
face
,
and
clever
,
observant
,
narrow
brown
eyes
,
and
was
wearing
ordinary
*NL*
dress
.
He
was
a
divinity
student
,
living
under
the
protection
of
the
*NL*
monastery
.
His
expression
was
one
of
unquestioning
,
but
self-respecting
,
*NL*
reverence
.
Being
in
a
subordinate
and
dependent
position
,
and
so
not
on
an
*NL*
equality
with
the
guests
,
he
did
not
greet
them
with
a
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Zossima
was
accompanied
by
a
novice
,
and
by
Alyosha
.
The
two
monks
*NL*
rose
and
greeted
him
with
a
very
deep
bow
,
touching
the
ground
with
their
*NL*
fingers
;
then
kissed
his
hand
.
Blessing
them
,
the
elder
replied
with
as
*NL*
deep
a
reverence
to
them
,
and
asked
their
blessing
.
The
whole
ceremony
was
*NL*
performed
very
seriously
and
with
an
appearance
of
feeling
,
not
like
an
*NL*
everyday
rite
.
But
Miuesov
fancied
that
it
was
all
done
with
intentional
*NL*
impressiveness
.
He
stood
in
front
of
the
other
visitors
.
He
ought
--
he
had
*NL*
reflected
upon
it
the
evening
before
--
from
simple
politeness
,
since
it
was
*NL*
the
custom
here
,
to
have
gone
up
to
receive
the
elder
's
blessing
,
even
if
*NL*
he
did
not
kiss
his
hand
.
But
when
he
saw
all
this
bowing
and
kissing
on
*NL*
the
part
of
the
monks
he
instantly
changed
his
mind
.
With
dignified
*NL*
gravity
he
made
a
rather
deep
,
conventional
bow
,
and
moved
away
to
a
*NL*
chair
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
did
the
same
,
mimicking
Miuesov
like
an
ape
.
Ivan
*NL*
bowed
with
great
dignity
and
courtesy
,
but
he
too
kept
his
hands
at
his
*NL*
sides
,
while
Kalganov
was
so
confused
that
he
did
not
bow
at
all
.
The
*NL*
elder
let
fall
the
hand
raised
to
bless
them
,
and
bowing
to
them
again
,
*NL*
asked
them
all
to
sit
down
.
The
blood
rushed
to
Alyosha
's
cheeks
.
He
was
*NL*
ashamed
.
His
forebodings
were
coming
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Zossima
sat
down
on
a
very
old-fashioned
mahogany
sofa
,
covered
*NL*
with
leather
,
and
made
his
visitors
sit
down
in
a
row
along
the
opposite
*NL*
wall
on
four
mahogany
chairs
,
covered
with
shabby
black
leather
.
The
monks
*NL*
sat
,
one
at
the
door
and
the
other
at
the
window
.
The
divinity
student
,
*NL*
the
novice
,
and
Alyosha
remained
standing
.
The
cell
was
not
very
large
and
*NL*
had
a
faded
look
.
It
contained
nothing
but
the
most
necessary
furniture
,
*NL*
of
coarse
and
poor
quality
.
There
were
two
pots
of
flowers
in
the
window
,
*NL*
and
a
number
of
holy
pictures
in
the
corner
.
Before
one
huge
ancient
ikon
*NL*
of
the
Virgin
a
lamp
was
burning
.
Near
it
were
two
other
holy
pictures
in
*NL*
shining
settings
,
and
,
next
them
,
carved
cherubims
,
china
eggs
,
a
Catholic
*NL*
cross
of
ivory
,
with
a
Mater
Dolorosa
embracing
it
,
and
several
foreign
*NL*
engravings
from
the
great
Italian
artists
of
past
centuries
.
Next
to
these
*NL*
costly
and
artistic
engravings
were
several
of
the
roughest
Russian
prints
*NL*
of
saints
and
martyrs
,
such
as
are
sold
for
a
few
farthings
at
all
the
*NL*
fairs
.
On
the
other
walls
were
portraits
of
Russian
bishops
,
past
and
*NL*
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miuesov
took
a
cursory
glance
at
all
these
``
conventional
''
surroundings
and
*NL*
bent
an
intent
look
upon
the
elder
.
He
had
a
high
opinion
of
his
own
*NL*
insight
,
a
weakness
excusable
in
him
as
he
was
fifty
,
an
age
at
which
a
*NL*
clever
man
of
the
world
of
established
position
can
hardly
help
taking
*NL*
himself
rather
seriously
.
At
the
first
moment
he
did
not
like
Zossima
.
*NL*
There
was
,
indeed
,
something
in
the
elder
's
face
which
many
people
besides
*NL*
Miuesov
might
not
have
liked
.
He
was
a
short
,
bent
,
little
man
,
with
very
*NL*
weak
legs
,
and
though
he
was
only
sixty-five
,
he
looked
at
least
ten
years
*NL*
older
.
His
face
was
very
thin
and
covered
with
a
network
of
fine
wrinkles
,
*NL*
particularly
numerous
about
his
eyes
,
which
were
small
,
light-colored
,
*NL*
quick
,
and
shining
like
two
bright
points
.
He
had
a
sprinkling
of
gray
*NL*
hair
about
his
temples
.
His
pointed
beard
was
small
and
scanty
,
and
his
*NL*
lips
,
which
smiled
frequently
,
were
as
thin
as
two
threads
.
His
nose
was
*NL*
not
long
,
but
sharp
,
like
a
bird
's
beak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
all
appearances
a
malicious
soul
,
full
of
petty
pride
,
''
thought
*NL*
Miuesov
.
He
felt
altogether
dissatisfied
with
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cheap
little
clock
on
the
wall
struck
twelve
hurriedly
,
and
served
to
*NL*
begin
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
to
our
time
,
''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
``
but
no
sign
of
my
son
,
*NL*
Dmitri
.
I
apologize
for
him
,
sacred
elder
!
''
-LRB-
Alyosha
shuddered
all
over
at
*NL*
``
sacred
elder
.
''
-RRB-
``
I
am
always
punctual
myself
,
minute
for
minute
,
*NL*
remembering
that
punctuality
is
the
courtesy
of
kings
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
not
a
king
,
anyway
,
''
Miuesov
muttered
,
losing
his
self
-
*NL*
restraint
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
true
.
I
'm
not
a
king
,
and
,
would
you
believe
it
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
I
was
aware
of
that
myself
.
But
,
there
!
I
always
say
the
*NL*
wrong
thing
.
Your
reverence
,
''
he
cried
,
with
sudden
pathos
,
``
you
behold
*NL*
before
you
a
buffoon
in
earnest
!
I
introduce
myself
as
such
.
It
's
an
old
*NL*
habit
,
alas
!
And
if
I
sometimes
talk
nonsense
out
of
place
it
's
with
an
*NL*
object
,
with
the
object
of
amusing
people
and
making
myself
agreeable
.
One
*NL*
must
be
agreeable
,
must
n't
one
?
I
was
seven
years
ago
in
a
little
town
*NL*
where
I
had
business
,
and
I
made
friends
with
some
merchants
there
.
We
*NL*
went
to
the
captain
of
police
because
we
had
to
see
him
about
something
,
*NL*
and
to
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
.
He
was
a
tall
,
fat
,
fair
,
sulky
man
,
the
*NL*
most
dangerous
type
in
such
cases
.
It
's
their
liver
.
I
went
straight
up
to
*NL*
him
,
and
with
the
ease
of
a
man
of
the
world
,
you
know
,
`
Mr.
Ispravnik
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
be
our
Napravnik
.
'
`
What
do
you
mean
by
Napravnik
?
'
said
he
.
I
*NL*
saw
,
at
the
first
half-second
,
that
it
had
missed
fire
.
He
stood
there
so
*NL*
glum
.
'
I
wanted
to
make
a
joke
,
'
said
I
,
`
for
the
general
diversion
,
as
*NL*
Mr.
Napravnik
is
our
well-known
Russian
orchestra
conductor
and
what
we
*NL*
need
for
the
harmony
of
our
undertaking
is
some
one
of
that
sort
.
'
And
I
*NL*
explained
my
comparison
very
reasonably
,
did
n't
I
?
`
Excuse
me
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
'
I
am
an
Ispravnik
,
and
I
do
not
allow
puns
to
be
made
on
my
calling
.
'
He
*NL*
turned
and
walked
away
.
I
followed
him
,
shouting
,
`
Yes
,
yes
,
you
are
an
*NL*
Ispravnik
,
not
a
Napravnik
.
'
`
No
,
'
he
said
,
`
since
you
called
me
a
*NL*
Napravnik
I
am
one
.
'
And
would
you
believe
it
,
it
ruined
our
business
!
And
*NL*
I
'm
always
like
that
,
always
like
that
.
Always
injuring
myself
with
my
*NL*
politeness
.
Once
,
many
years
ago
,
I
said
to
an
influential
person
:
`
Your
*NL*
wife
is
a
ticklish
lady
,
'
in
an
honorable
sense
,
of
the
moral
qualities
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
.
But
he
asked
me
,
`
Why
,
have
you
tickled
her
?
'
I
thought
I
'd
*NL*
be
polite
,
so
I
could
n't
help
saying
,
`
Yes
,
'
and
he
gave
me
a
fine
*NL*
tickling
on
the
spot
.
Only
that
happened
long
ago
,
so
I
'm
not
ashamed
to
*NL*
tell
the
story
.
I
'm
always
injuring
myself
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
doing
it
now
,
''
muttered
Miuesov
,
with
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Zossima
scrutinized
them
both
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
Would
you
believe
it
,
I
was
aware
of
that
,
too
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
and
let
me
tell
you
,
indeed
,
I
foresaw
I
should
as
soon
as
*NL*
I
began
to
speak
.
And
do
you
know
I
foresaw
,
too
,
that
you
'd
be
the
first
*NL*
to
remark
on
it
.
The
minute
I
see
my
joke
is
n't
coming
off
,
your
*NL*
reverence
,
both
my
cheeks
feel
as
though
they
were
drawn
down
to
the
lower
*NL*
jaw
and
there
is
almost
a
spasm
in
them
.
That
's
been
so
since
I
was
young
,
*NL*
when
I
had
to
make
jokes
for
my
living
in
noblemen
's
families
.
I
am
an
*NL*
inveterate
buffoon
,
and
have
been
from
birth
up
,
your
reverence
,
it
's
as
*NL*
though
it
were
a
craze
in
me
.
I
dare
say
it
's
a
devil
within
me
.
But
only
*NL*
a
little
one
.
A
more
serious
one
would
have
chosen
another
lodging
.
But
*NL*
not
your
soul
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
;
you
're
not
a
lodging
worth
having
*NL*
either
.
But
I
do
believe
--
I
believe
in
God
,
though
I
have
had
doubts
of
*NL*
late
.
But
now
I
sit
and
await
words
of
wisdom
.
I
'm
like
the
philosopher
,
*NL*
Diderot
,
your
reverence
.
Did
you
ever
hear
,
most
Holy
Father
,
how
Diderot
*NL*
went
to
see
the
Metropolitan
Platon
,
in
the
time
of
the
Empress
Catherine
?
*NL*
He
went
in
and
said
straight
out
,
`
There
is
no
God
.
'
To
which
the
great
*NL*
bishop
lifted
up
his
finger
and
answered
,
`
The
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
*NL*
there
is
no
God
.
'
And
he
fell
down
at
his
feet
on
the
spot
.
'
I
believe
,
'
*NL*
he
cried
,
`
and
will
be
christened
.
'
And
so
he
was
.
Princess
Dashkov
was
*NL*
his
godmother
,
and
Potyomkin
his
godfather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
this
is
unbearable
!
You
know
you
're
telling
lies
and
*NL*
that
that
stupid
anecdote
is
n't
true
.
Why
are
you
playing
the
fool
?
''
cried
*NL*
Miuesov
in
a
shaking
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspected
all
my
life
that
it
was
n't
true
,
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
cried
*NL*
with
conviction
.
``
But
I
'll
tell
you
the
whole
truth
,
gentlemen
.
Great
*NL*
elder
!
Forgive
me
,
the
last
thing
about
Diderot
's
christening
I
made
up
*NL*
just
now
.
I
never
thought
of
it
before
.
I
made
it
up
to
add
piquancy
.
I
*NL*
play
the
fool
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
,
to
make
myself
agreeable
.
Though
I
*NL*
really
do
n't
know
myself
,
sometimes
,
what
I
do
it
for
.
And
as
for
Diderot
,
*NL*
I
heard
as
far
as
`
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
'
twenty
times
from
the
*NL*
gentry
about
here
when
I
was
young
.
I
heard
your
aunt
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
tell
the
story
.
They
all
believe
to
this
day
that
the
*NL*
infidel
Diderot
came
to
dispute
about
God
with
the
Metropolitan
*NL*
Platon
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miuesov
got
up
,
forgetting
himself
in
his
impatience
.
He
was
furious
,
and
*NL*
conscious
of
being
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
taking
place
in
the
cell
was
really
incredible
.
For
forty
or
*NL*
fifty
years
past
,
from
the
times
of
former
elders
,
no
visitors
had
entered
*NL*
that
cell
without
feelings
of
the
profoundest
veneration
.
Almost
every
one
*NL*
admitted
to
the
cell
felt
that
a
great
favor
was
being
shown
him
.
Many
*NL*
remained
kneeling
during
the
whole
visit
.
Of
those
visitors
,
many
had
been
*NL*
men
of
high
rank
and
learning
,
some
even
freethinkers
,
attracted
by
*NL*
curiosity
,
but
all
without
exception
had
shown
the
profoundest
reverence
*NL*
and
delicacy
,
for
here
there
was
no
question
of
money
,
but
only
,
on
the
*NL*
one
side
love
and
kindness
,
and
on
the
other
penitence
and
eager
desire
to
*NL*
decide
some
spiritual
problem
or
crisis
.
So
that
such
buffoonery
amazed
*NL*
and
bewildered
the
spectators
,
or
at
least
some
of
them
.
The
monks
,
with
*NL*
unchanged
countenances
,
waited
,
with
earnest
attention
,
to
hear
what
the
*NL*
elder
would
say
,
but
seemed
on
the
point
of
standing
up
,
like
Miuesov
.
*NL*
Alyosha
stood
,
with
hanging
head
,
on
the
verge
of
tears
.
What
seemed
to
*NL*
him
strangest
of
all
was
that
his
brother
Ivan
,
on
whom
alone
he
had
*NL*
rested
his
hopes
,
and
who
alone
had
such
influence
on
his
father
that
he
*NL*
could
have
stopped
him
,
sat
now
quite
unmoved
,
with
downcast
eyes
,
*NL*
apparently
waiting
with
interest
to
see
how
it
would
end
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
Alyosha
did
not
dare
to
look
at
Rakitin
,
the
*NL*
divinity
student
,
whom
he
knew
almost
intimately
.
He
alone
in
the
*NL*
monastery
knew
Rakitin
's
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
''
began
Miuesov
,
addressing
Father
Zossima
,
``
for
perhaps
I
seem
*NL*
to
be
taking
part
in
this
shameful
foolery
.
I
made
a
mistake
in
believing
*NL*
that
even
a
man
like
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
would
understand
what
was
due
on
a
*NL*
visit
to
so
honored
a
personage
.
I
did
not
suppose
I
should
have
to
*NL*
apologize
simply
for
having
come
with
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
could
say
no
more
,
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
distress
yourself
,
I
beg
.
''
The
elder
got
on
to
his
feeble
legs
,
and
*NL*
taking
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
by
both
hands
,
made
him
sit
down
again
.
``
I
beg
*NL*
you
not
to
disturb
yourself
.
I
particularly
beg
you
to
be
my
guest
.
''
And
*NL*
with
a
bow
he
went
back
and
sat
down
again
on
his
little
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
elder
,
speak
!
Do
I
annoy
you
by
my
vivacity
?
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
cried
suddenly
,
clutching
the
arms
of
his
chair
in
both
hands
,
as
though
*NL*
ready
to
leap
up
from
it
if
the
answer
were
unfavorable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
earnestly
beg
you
,
too
,
not
to
disturb
yourself
,
and
not
to
be
uneasy
,
''
*NL*
the
elder
said
impressively
.
``
Do
not
trouble
.
Make
yourself
quite
at
home
.
*NL*
And
,
above
all
,
do
not
be
so
ashamed
of
yourself
,
for
that
is
at
the
root
*NL*
of
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
at
home
?
To
be
my
natural
self
?
Oh
,
that
is
much
too
much
,
but
I
*NL*
accept
it
with
grateful
joy
.
Do
you
know
,
blessed
Father
,
you
'd
better
not
*NL*
invite
me
to
be
my
natural
self
.
Do
n't
risk
it
...
I
will
not
go
so
far
as
*NL*
that
myself
.
I
warn
you
for
your
own
sake
.
Well
,
the
rest
is
still
plunged
*NL*
in
the
mists
of
uncertainty
,
though
there
are
people
who
'd
be
pleased
to
*NL*
describe
me
for
you
.
I
mean
that
for
you
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
.
But
as
for
*NL*
you
,
holy
being
,
let
me
tell
you
,
I
am
brimming
over
with
ecstasy
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
,
and
throwing
up
his
hands
,
declaimed
,
``
Blessed
be
the
womb
that
*NL*
bare
thee
,
and
the
paps
that
gave
thee
suck
--
the
paps
especially
.
When
you
*NL*
said
just
now
,
`
Do
n't
be
so
ashamed
of
yourself
,
for
that
is
at
the
root
*NL*
of
it
all
,
'
you
pierced
right
through
me
by
that
remark
,
and
read
me
to
*NL*
the
core
.
Indeed
,
I
always
feel
when
I
meet
people
that
I
am
lower
than
*NL*
all
,
and
that
they
all
take
me
for
a
buffoon
.
So
I
say
,
`
Let
me
really
*NL*
play
the
buffoon

I
am
not
afraid
of
your
opinion
,
for
you
are
every
one
*NL*
of
you
worse
than
I
am

That
is
why
I
am
a
buffoon

It
is
from
shame
,
*NL*
great
elder
,
from
shame
;
it
's
simply
over-sensitiveness
that
makes
me
*NL*
rowdy
.
If
I
had
only
been
sure
that
every
one
would
accept
me
as
the
*NL*
kindest
and
wisest
of
men
,
oh
,
Lord
,
what
a
good
man
I
should
have
been
*NL*
then
!
Teacher
!
''
he
fell
suddenly
on
his
knees
,
``
what
must
I
do
to
gain
*NL*
eternal
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
difficult
even
now
to
decide
whether
he
was
joking
or
really
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Zossima
,
lifting
his
eyes
,
looked
at
him
,
and
said
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
known
for
a
long
time
what
you
must
do
.
You
have
sense
enough
:
*NL*
do
n't
give
way
to
drunkenness
and
incontinence
of
speech
;
do
n't
give
way
*NL*
to
sensual
lust
;
and
,
above
all
,
to
the
love
of
money
.
And
close
your
*NL*
taverns
.
If
you
ca
n't
close
all

at

two

And
,
above
*NL*
all

do
n't
lie

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

about
Diderot

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
about
Diderot

Above
all
,
do
n't
lie
to
yourself
.
The
man
who
lies
*NL*
to
himself
and
listens
to
his
own
lie
comes
to
such
a
pass
that
he
can
not
*NL*
distinguish
the
truth
within
him
,
or
around
him
,
and
so
loses
all
respect
*NL*
for
himself
and
for
others

And
having
no
respect
he
ceases
to
love
,
and
*NL*
in
order
to
occupy
and
distract
himself
without
love
he
gives
way
to
*NL*
passions
and
coarse
pleasures
,
and
sinks
to
bestiality
in
his
vices
,
all
*NL*
from
continual
lying
to
other
men
and
to
himself
.
The
man
who
lies
to
*NL*
himself
can
be
more
easily
offended
than
any
one
.
You
know
it
is
sometimes
*NL*
very
pleasant
to
take
offense
,
is
n't
it
?
A
man
may
know
that
nobody
has
*NL*
insulted
him
,
but
that
he
has
invented
the
insult
for
himself
,
has
lied
*NL*
and
exaggerated
to
make
it
picturesque
,
has
caught
at
a
word
and
made
a
*NL*
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
--
he
knows
that
himself
,
yet
he
will
be
the
first
*NL*
to
take
offense
,
and
will
revel
in
his
resentment
till
he
feels
great
*NL*
pleasure
in
it
,
and
so
pass
to
genuine
vindictiveness
.
But
get
up
,
sit
*NL*
down
,
I
beg
you
.
All
this
,
too
,
is
deceitful
posturing

*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
skipped
up

imprinted
a
rapid
kiss
on
the
elder

*NL*
thin
hand
.
``
It

I

my

my

talk

do
no

do
harm

here

Here

my

it

that
the
story
is
told
*NL*
somewhere
in
the

saint
martyred
for
his

faith
who
,
when
his
head
was
cut
off
at
last
,
stood
up
,
picked
up
his
*NL*
head
,
and
,
`
courteously
kissing
it
,
'
walked
a
long
way

carrying
it
in

Is
that
true

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

the

You
knew
nothing
of
it
,
but
I
went
*NL*
home
with
my
faith
shaken
,
and
I
have
been
getting
more
and
more
shaken
*NL*
ever
since
.
Yes
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
,
you
were
the
cause
of
a
great
fall
.
*NL*
That
was
not
a
Diderot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
got
excited
and
pathetic
,
though
it
was
perfectly
clear
*NL*
to
every
one
by
now
that
he
was
playing
a
part
again
.
Yet
Miuesov
was
stung
*NL*
by
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
,
and
it
is
all
nonsense
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
I
may
really
have
*NL*
told
it
,
some
time
or
other
...
but
not
to
you
.
I
was
told
it
myself
.
I
*NL*
heard
it
in
Paris
from
a
Frenchman
.
He
told
me
it
was
read
at
our
mass
*NL*
from
the
_
Lives
of
the
Saints
_
...
he
was
a
very
learned
man
who
had
made
*NL*
a
special
study
of
Russian
statistics
and
had
lived
a
long
time
in
*NL*
Russia
...
I
have
not
read
the
_
Lives
of
the
Saints
_
myself
,
and
I
am
not
*NL*
going
to
read
them

all

of

at
dinner

we
were
*NL*
dining
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
were
dining
then
,
and
so
I
lost
my
faith
!
''
said
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
mimicking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
care
for
your
faith
?
''
Miuesov
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
,
but
*NL*
he
suddenly
checked
himself
,
and
said
with
contempt
,
``
You
defile
*NL*
everything
you
touch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
.
``
Excuse
me
,
gentlemen
,
for
leaving
*NL*
you
a
few
minutes
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
all
his
guests
.
``
I
have
visitors
*NL*
awaiting
me
who
arrived
before
you
.
But
do
n't
you
tell
lies
all
the
same
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
turning
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
with
a
good-humored
face
.
He
went
*NL*
out
of
the
cell
.
Alyosha
and
the
novice
flew
to
escort
him
down
the
steps
.
*NL*
Alyosha
was
breathless
:
he
was
glad
to
get
away
,
but
he
was
glad
,
too
,
*NL*
that
the
elder
was
good-humored
and
not
offended
.
Father
Zossima
was
going
*NL*
towards
the
portico
to
bless
the
people
waiting
for
him
there
.
But
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
persisted
in
stopping
him
at
the
door
of
the
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
man
!
''
he
cried
,
with
feeling
.
``
Allow
me
to
kiss
your
hand
once
*NL*
more

Yes
,
with
you
I
could
still
talk

I
could
still
get
on

Do
you
think

I
always
lie
and
play
the
fool
like

Believe
me

I
have
been
acting

I
have
been
testing
you
all

the

to
see
whether
I
could

you

Is
there

I
am

give

now

I

I
will
keep
quiet
all

I

Now

Peasant
Women
Who
Have
Faith
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
wooden
portico
below
,
built
on
to
the
outer
wall
of
the
precinct
,
*NL*
there
was
a
crowd
of
about
twenty
peasant
women
.
They
had
been
told
that
*NL*
the
elder
was
at
last
coming
out
,
and
they
had
gathered
together
in
*NL*
anticipation
.
Two
ladies
,
Madame
Hohlakov
and
her
daughter
,
had
also
come
*NL*
out
into
the
portico
to
wait
for
the
elder
,
but
in
a
separate
part
of
it
*NL*
set
aside
for
women
of
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
was
a
wealthy
lady
,
still
young
and
attractive
,
and
always
*NL*
dressed
with
taste
.
She
was
rather
pale
,
and
had
lively
black
eyes
.
She
*NL*
was
not
more
than
thirty-three
,
and
had
been
five
years
a
widow
.
Her
*NL*
daughter
,
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
was
partially
paralyzed
.
The
poor
child
had
*NL*
not
been
able
to
walk
for
the
last
six
months
,
and
was
wheeled
about
in
a
*NL*
long
reclining
chair
.
She
had
a
charming
little
face
,
rather
thin
from
*NL*
illness
,
but
full
of
gayety
.
There
was
a
gleam
of
mischief
in
her
big
dark
*NL*
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
.
Her
mother
had
been
intending
to
take
her
*NL*
abroad
ever
since
the
spring
,
but
they
had
been
detained
all
the
summer
by
*NL*
business
connected
with
their
estate
.
They
had
been
staying
a
week
in
our
*NL*
town
,
where
they
had
come
more
for
purposes
of
business
than
devotion
,
but
*NL*
had
visited
Father
Zossima
once
already
,
three
days
before
.
Though
they
*NL*
knew
that
the
elder
scarcely
saw
any
one
,
they
had
now
suddenly
turned
up
*NL*
again
,
and
urgently
entreated
``
the
happiness
of
looking
once
again
on
the
*NL*
great
healer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
her
daughter
's
invalid
*NL*
carriage
,
and
two
paces
from
her
stood
an
old
monk
,
not
one
of
our
*NL*
monastery
,
but
a
visitor
from
an
obscure
religious
house
in
the
far
north
.
*NL*
He
too
sought
the
elder
's
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Father
Zossima
,
on
entering
the
portico
,
went
first
straight
to
the
*NL*
peasants
who
were
crowded
at
the
foot
of
the
three
steps
that
led
up
into
*NL*
the
portico
.
Father
Zossima
stood
on
the
top
step
,
put
on
his
stole
,
and
*NL*
began
blessing
the
women
who
thronged
about
him
.
One
crazy
woman
was
led
*NL*
up
to
him
.
As
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
elder
she
began
shrieking
*NL*
and
writhing
as
though
in
the
pains
of
childbirth
.
Laying
the
stole
on
her
*NL*
forehead
,
he
read
a
short
prayer
over
her
,
and
she
was
at
once
soothed
and
*NL*
quieted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
now
,
but
in
my
childhood
I
often
happened
to
*NL*
see
and
hear
these
``
possessed
''
women
in
the
villages
and
monasteries
.
They
*NL*
used
to
be
brought
to
mass
;
they
would
squeal
and
bark
like
a
dog
so
that
*NL*
they
were
heard
all
over
the
church
.
But
when
the
sacrament
was
carried
in
*NL*
and
they
were
led
up
to
it
,
at
once
the
``
possession
''
ceased
,
and
the
sick
*NL*
women
were
always
soothed
for
a
time
.
I
was
greatly
impressed
and
amazed
*NL*
at
this
as
a
child
;
but
then
I
heard
from
country
neighbors
and
from
my
*NL*
town
teachers
that
the
whole
illness
was
simulated
to
avoid
work
,
and
that
*NL*
it
could
always
be
cured
by
suitable
severity
;
various
anecdotes
were
told
*NL*
to
confirm
this
.
But
later
on
I
learnt
with
astonishment
from
medical
*NL*
specialists
that
there
is
no
pretense
about
it
,
that
it
is
a
terrible
*NL*
illness
to
which
women
are
subject
,
specially
prevalent
among
us
in
*NL*
Russia
,
and
that
it
is
due
to
the
hard
lot
of
the
peasant
women
.
It
is
a
*NL*
disease
,
I
was
told
,
arising
from
exhausting
toil
too
soon
after
hard
,
*NL*
abnormal
and
unassisted
labor
in
childbirth
,
and
from
the
hopeless
misery
,
*NL*
from
beatings
,
and
so
on
,
which
some
women
were
not
able
to
endure
like
*NL*
others
.
The
strange
and
instant
healing
of
the
frantic
and
struggling
*NL*
woman
as
soon
as
she
was
led
up
to
the
holy
sacrament
,
which
had
been
*NL*
explained
to
me
as
due
to
malingering
and
the
trickery
of
the
``
clericals
,
''
*NL*
arose
probably
in
the
most
natural
manner
.
Both
the
women
who
supported
*NL*
her
and
the
invalid
herself
fully
believed
as
a
truth
beyond
question
that
*NL*
the
evil
spirit
in
possession
of
her
could
not
hold
out
if
the
sick
woman
*NL*
were
brought
to
the
sacrament
and
made
to
bow
down
before
it
.
And
so
,
with
*NL*
a
nervous
and
psychically
deranged
woman
,
a
sort
of
convulsion
of
the
*NL*
whole
organism
always
took
place
,
and
was
bound
to
take
place
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
of
bowing
down
to
the
sacrament
,
aroused
by
the
expectation
of
the
*NL*
miracle
of
healing
and
the
implicit
belief
that
it
would
come
to
pass
;
and
*NL*
it
did
come
to
pass
,
though
only
for
a
moment
.
It
was
exactly
the
same
now
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
elder
touched
the
sick
woman
with
the
stole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
the
women
in
the
crowd
were
moved
to
tears
of
ecstasy
by
the
*NL*
effect
of
the
moment
:
some
strove
to
kiss
the
hem
of
his
garment
,
others
*NL*
cried
out
in
sing-song
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
blessed
them
all
and
talked
with
some
of
them
.
The
``
possessed
''
woman
he
*NL*
knew
already
.
She
came
from
a
village
only
six
versts
from
the
monastery
,
*NL*
and
had
been
brought
to
him
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
is
one
from
afar
.
''
He
pointed
to
a
woman
by
no
means
old
but
*NL*
very
thin
and
wasted
,
with
a
face
not
merely
sunburnt
but
almost
blackened
*NL*
by
exposure
.
She
was
kneeling
and
gazing
with
a
fixed
stare
at
the
elder
;
*NL*
there
was
something
almost
frenzied
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
afar
off
,
Father
,
from
afar
off
!
From
two
hundred
miles
from
here
.
*NL*
From
afar
off
,
Father
,
from
afar
off
!
''
the
woman
began
in
a
sing-song
*NL*
voice
as
though
she
were
chanting
a
dirge
,
swaying
her
head
from
side
to
*NL*
side
with
her
cheek
resting
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
silent
and
long-suffering
sorrow
to
be
met
with
among
the
*NL*
peasantry
.
It
withdraws
into
itself
and
is
still
.
But
there
is
a
grief
*NL*
that
breaks
out
,
and
from
that
minute
it
bursts
into
tears
and
finds
vent
*NL*
in
wailing
.
This
is
particularly
common
with
women
.
But
it
is
no
lighter
a
*NL*
grief
than
the
silent
.
Lamentations
comfort
only
by
lacerating
the
heart
*NL*
still
more
.
Such
grief
does
not
desire
consolation
.
It
feeds
on
the
sense
*NL*
of
its
hopelessness
.
Lamentations
spring
only
from
the
constant
craving
to
*NL*
reopen
the
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
of
the
tradesman
class
?
''
said
Father
Zossima
,
looking
curiously
*NL*
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Townfolk
we
are
,
Father
,

Yet
we
are

``

``
It

begun
*NL*
drinking
while

away

As

he
gives
way

now
I
do

``
Listen

said
the

``
Once
in
olden
times
a
holy
saint
saw
in

the
Temple
a
mother
like
you
weeping
for
her
little
one
,
her
only
one
,
*NL*
whom
God
had
taken
.
`
Knowest

said
the
saint
to
her
,
`
how
bold
*NL*
these
little
ones
are
before
the
throne
of
God

Verily
there
are
none

bolder
than
they
in

Kingdom

``
Thou
didst
give

they
say

``
and
scarcely
had
we
looked
upon
it
when
Thou
didst
take

it
back
again

And
so
boldly
they
ask
and
ask
again
that
God
gives
them
*NL*
at

the
rank
of
angels

Therefore

That
's
what
the
saint
said
to
the
weeping
*NL*
mother
of
old

He
was
a
great
saint

he
could
not

spoken
falsely

Therefore
you

know
that
your
little
one
is
surely
before

throne
of
God

is
rejoicing

happy
,

praying
to
God
for
you

weep
not

rejoice

The

listened
to
him

looking
down

She

sighed
deeply

said

no

singing
with

He
says

himself

the

began
in

sing-song

the

had
already
turned
away
to
a
very
old
*NL*
woman

dressed
like
a
dweller
in

not
like

Her

showed
that
she
had
come
with
an

in
order
to
say
something

*NL*
She
said
she
was
the
widow
of
a
non-commissioned

lived
close
*NL*
by

Her
son

was

had

gone

He

gazing

*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by

But
she
is
still
lying
down
in
her
chair

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
her
night
fevers
have
entirely
ceased
ever

Thursday

said
the
*NL*
lady
with
nervous
haste
.
``
And
that
's
not
all

Her
legs
are
stronger

This
*NL*
morning
she
got
up
well
;
she
had
slept
all
night
.
Look
at
her
rosy
cheeks
,
*NL*
her
bright
eyes
!
She
used
to
be
always
crying
,
but
now
she
laughs
and
is
*NL*
gay
and
happy
.
This
morning
she
insisted
on
my
letting
her
stand
up
,
and
*NL*
she
stood
up
for
a
whole
minute
without
any
support
.
She
wagers
that
in
a
*NL*
fortnight
she
'll
be
dancing
a
quadrille

I
've
called
in
Doctor
*NL*
Herzenstube
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
,
'
I
am
amazed
;
I
can
make
*NL*
nothing
of
it
.
'
And
would
you
have
us
not
come
here
to
disturb
you
,
not
*NL*
fly
here
to
thank
you
?
Lise
,
thank
him
--
thank
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lise
's
pretty
little
laughing
face
became
suddenly
serious
.
She
rose
in
*NL*
her
chair
as
far
as
she
could
and
,
looking
at
the
elder
,
clasped
her
hands
*NL*
before
him
,
but
could
not
restrain
herself
and
broke
into
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
at
him
,
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
Alyosha
,
with
childish
vexation
at
*NL*
herself
for
not
being
able
to
repress
her
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
any
one
had
looked
at
Alyosha
standing
a
step
behind
the
elder
,
he
*NL*
would
have
caught
a
quick
flush
crimsoning
his
cheeks
in
an
instant
.
His
*NL*
eyes
shone
and
he
looked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
a
message
for
you
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
How
are
you
?
''
the
mother
*NL*
went
on
,
holding
out
her
exquisitely
gloved
hand
to
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
turned
round
and
all
at
once
looked
attentively
at
Alyosha
.
The
*NL*
latter
went
nearer
to
Lise
and
,
smiling
in
a
strangely
awkward
way
,
held
*NL*
out
his
hand
to
her
too
.
Lise
assumed
an
important
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
has
sent
you
this
through
me
.
''
She
handed
him
a
little
*NL*
note
.
``
She
particularly
begs
you
to
go
and
see
her
as
soon
as
possible
;
*NL*
that
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
asks
me
to
go
and
see

Me

What
for

Alyosha
muttered
in
great
*NL*
astonishment
.
His
face
at
once
looked
anxious
.
``
Oh
,
it
's
all
to
do
with
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
and
--
what
has
happened
lately
,
''
the
mother
explained
*NL*
hurriedly
.
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
has
made
up
her
mind
,
but
she
must
see
you
*NL*
about
it
...
Why
,
of
course
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
But
she
wants
to
see
you
at
*NL*
once
.
And
you
will
go
to
her
,
of
course
.
It
is
a
Christian
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
seen
her
once
,
''
Alyosha
protested
with
the
same
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
is
such
a
lofty

incomparable
creature

If
only
for
her

suffering

Think
what

has
gone
through

what
she
is
enduring
now
!
*NL*
Think
what
awaits
her

It
's
all
terrible
,
terrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
will
come
,
''
Alyosha
decided
,
after
rapidly
scanning
the
*NL*
brief
,
enigmatic
note
,
which
consisted
of
an
urgent
entreaty
that
he
would
*NL*
come
,
without
any
sort
of
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
sweet
and
generous
that
would
be
of
you
!
''
cried
Lise
with
sudden
*NL*
animation
.
``
I
told
mamma
you
'd
be
sure
not
to
go
.
I
said
you
were
saving
*NL*
your
soul

How
splendid
you
are
!
I
've
always
thought
you
were
splendid
.
*NL*
How
glad
I
am
to
tell
you
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lise
!
''
said
her
mother
impressively
,
though
she
smiled
after
she
had
said
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
quite
forgotten
us
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
never
*NL*
come
to
see
us
.
Yet
Lise
has
told
me
twice
that
she
is
never
happy
except
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
raised
his
downcast
eyes
and
again
flushed
,
and
again
smiled
*NL*
without
knowing
why
.
But
the
elder
was
no
longer
watching
him
.
He
had
*NL*
begun
talking
to
a
monk
who
,
as
mentioned
before
,
had
been
awaiting
his
*NL*
entrance
by
Lise
's
chair
.
He
was
evidently
a
monk
of
the
humblest
,
that
is
*NL*
of
the
peasant
,
class
,
of
a
narrow
outlook
,
but
a
true
believer
,
and
,
in
*NL*
his
own
way
,
a
stubborn
one
.
He
announced
that
he
had
come
from
the
far
*NL*
north
,
from
Obdorsk
,
from
Saint
Sylvester
,
and
was
a
member
of
a
poor
*NL*
monastery
,
consisting
of
only
ten
monks
.
The
elder
gave
him
his
blessing
*NL*
and
invited
him
to
come
to
his
cell
whenever
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
presume
to
do
such
deeds
?
''
the
monk
asked
suddenly
,
pointing
*NL*
solemnly
and
significantly
at
Lise
.
He
was
referring
to
her
``
healing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
early
,
of
course
,
to
speak
of
that
.
Relief
is
not
complete
cure
,
*NL*
and
may
proceed
from
different
causes
.
But
if
there
has
been
any
healing
,
*NL*
it
is
by
no
power
but
God
's
will
.
It
's
all
from
God
.
Visit
me
,
Father
,
''
he
*NL*
added
to
the
monk
.
``
It
's
not
often
I
can
see
visitors
.
I
am
ill
,
and
I
*NL*
know
that
my
days
are
numbered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
God
will
not
take
you
from
us
.
You
will
live
a
long
,
long
*NL*
time
yet

''
cried
the
lady
.
``
And
in
what
way
are
you
ill
?
You
look
so
well
,
*NL*
so
gay
and
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extraordinarily
better
to-day
.
But
I
know
that
it
's
only
for
a
*NL*
moment

I
understand
my
disease
now
thoroughly
.
If
I
seem
so
happy
to
you
,
*NL*
you
could
never
say
anything
that
would
please
me
so
much
.
For
men
are
*NL*
made
for
happiness
,
and
any
one
who
is
completely
happy
has
a
right
to
say
*NL*
to
himself

I
am
doing
God
's
will
on
earth

All
the
righteous
,
all
the
*NL*
saints

all
the
holy
martyrs

happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
you
speak
!
What
bold
and
lofty
words
!
''
cried
the
lady
.
``
You
seem
*NL*
to
pierce
with
your
words
.
And
yet
--
happiness
,
happiness
--
where
is
it

Who
*NL*
can
say
of
himself
that
he
is
happy

,
since
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
*NL*

us
see
you
once
more
to-day
,
let
me
tell
you
what
I
could
not
utter
*NL*
last
time
,
what
I
dared
not
say

all
I
am
suffering
and
have
been
for
so
*NL*
long
!
I
am
suffering

Forgive
me
!
I
am
suffering

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
a
rush
of
fervent
feeling
she
clasped
her
hands
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
specially
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suffer
...
from
lack
of
faith

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lack

faith

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

not

But
the
future
life

such
*NL*
an
enigma

And
no
one

no

can
solve
it

Listen

You
are
a
healer

you

deeply
versed

dare
not

entirely

but
I
assure
you
on
my
word
of
honor
that
I
am
not

speaking
lightly
now

The
thought

the
life
beyond
the
grave
distracts
*NL*
me
to
anguish

to
terror

And
I
do
n't
know
to
whom
to
appeal
,
and
have
not
*NL*
dared
to
all
my
life

And
now
I
am
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
.
Oh
,
God
!
What
*NL*
will
you
think

me
now

*NL*
*NL*
She
clasped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
distress
yourself
about
my
opinion

said
the
elder

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

shut
my

ask
myself

every
one
has
faith
,
where
did
it
come
from
?
And
then
they
do
say
that
it

all
comes
from
terror
at
the
menacing
phenomena

nature

that
none

I

awful

How

how
can

back
my

faith

I
only
believed

a
little

mechanically

I
have
come

lay
my
soul

you
about
it

If
I
let
this
chance
*NL*
slip

no
one
all
my

will
answer
me

How
can
I
prove
it

How
can
I
*NL*
convince
myself
?
Oh
,
how
unhappy
I
am
!
I
stand
and
look
about
me
and
see
*NL*
that
scarcely
any
one
else
cares
;
no
one
troubles
his
head
about
it
,
and
*NL*
I
'm
the
only
one
who

stand
it

It

deadly

deadly
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
``
How

``
By

surer

In

fervently

almost
frantically

``
That
's
the
chief
question

my
most

agonizing
question

I
shut
my

ask
myself
,
`
Would
you
persevere
*NL*
long
on
that
path

And
if
the
patient

meet
you
with
gratitude

worried
you
with
his

without
valuing

began
abusing

rudely

complaining

then

Would

do
you

I
came
with
horror

the
conclusion

it

ingratitude

that
is

loving
any

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
a
very
paroxysm
of
self-castigation
,
and
,
concluding
,
she
*NL*
looked
with
defiant
resolution
at
the
elder

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
the

a
doctor
once
told
me

observed
the
elder

He
was
a
man
getting
on

clever

spoke

frankly

though
in
jest
,
in
bitter
jest

'
I
love
humanity

'
he
*NL*
said

I
wonder
at
myself

The
more
I
love
humanity
in
general
,
the
*NL*
less
I
love
man
in
particular

In
my
dreams

he
said

'
I
have
often
come
*NL*
to
making
enthusiastic
schemes
for
the
service

humanity

perhaps
I
*NL*
might
actually
have
faced
crucifixion
if
it
had
been
suddenly
necessary
;
*NL*
and
yet
I
am
incapable
of
living
in
the
same
room
with
any
one
for
two
*NL*
days
together
,
as
I
know
by
experience
.
As
soon
as
any
one
is
near
me
,
his
*NL*
personality
disturbs
my
self-complacency
and
restricts
my
freedom
.
In
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
I
begin
to
hate
the
best
of
men
:
one
because
he
's
too
*NL*
long
over
his
dinner
;
another
because
he
has
a
cold
and
keeps
on
blowing
*NL*
his
nose
.
I
become
hostile
to
people
the
moment
they
come
close
to
me

But
*NL*

ardent

my

*NL*

But
what

to

What
can

Must

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

It

Do
what
you

it

be
reckoned

Much
is
done
already
in

since
you

so
*NL*
deeply

sincerely
know
yourself

If
you

simply

gain
approbation

you

me
just

you

anything

the

achievement

real
love

it
will
all
get
no
further
than
dreams
,
and
your
*NL*
whole
life
will
slip
away
like
a
phantom

In
that
case
you
will
naturally
*NL*
cease
to
think

life

will
of
yourself
grow
calmer

fashion

You

Only
now

I

*NL*
really
only
seeking
your
approbation
for
my
sincerity
when
I
told
you
I
*NL*
could
not
endure
ingratitude
.
You
have
revealed
me
to
myself

You
have
*NL*
seen
through
me

explained
me
to
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
speaking
the
truth

Well
,
now
,
after
such
a
confession
,
I
believe
*NL*
that
you
are
sincere
and
good
at
heart
.
If
you
do
not
attain
happiness
,
*NL*
always
remember
that
you
are
on
the
right
road
,
and
try
not
to
leave
it
.
*NL*
Above
all
,
avoid
falsehood
,
every
kind
of
falsehood
,
especially
falseness
*NL*
to
yourself
.
Watch
over
your
own
deceitfulness
and
look
into
it
every
*NL*
hour
,
every
minute
.
Avoid
being
scornful
,
both
to
others
and
to
yourself
.
*NL*
What
seems
to
you
bad
within
you
will
grow
purer
from
the
very
fact
of
*NL*
your
observing
it
in
yourself
.
Avoid
fear
,
too
,
though
fear
is
only
the
*NL*
consequence
of
every
sort
of
falsehood
.
Never
be
frightened
at
your
own
*NL*
faint-heartedness
in
attaining
love
.
Do
n't
be
frightened
overmuch
even
at
*NL*
your
evil
actions
.
I
am
sorry
I
can
say
nothing
more
consoling
to
you
,
for
*NL*
love
in
action
is
a
harsh
and
dreadful
thing
compared
with
love
in
dreams
.
*NL*
Love
in
dreams
is
greedy
for
immediate
action
,
rapidly
performed
and
in
*NL*
the
sight
of
all
.
Men
will
even
give
their
lives
if
only
the
ordeal
does
*NL*
not
last
long
but
is
soon
over
,
with
all
looking
on
and
applauding
as
*NL*
though
on
the
stage
.
But
active
love
is
labor
and
fortitude
,
and
for
some
*NL*
people
too
,
perhaps
,
a
complete
science
.
But
I
predict
that
just
when
you
*NL*
see
with
horror
that
in
spite
of
all
your
efforts
you
are
getting
farther
*NL*
from
your
goal
instead
of
nearer
to
it
--
at
that
very
moment
I
predict
that
*NL*
you
will
reach
it
and
behold
clearly
the
miraculous
power
of
the
Lord
who
*NL*
has
been
all
the
time
loving
and
mysteriously
guiding
you
.
Forgive
me
for
*NL*
not
being
able
to
stay
longer
with
you

They
are
waiting
for
me

Good-by

The
lady
was
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lise

Lise

Bless

she
cried
,
starting
up
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
not
deserve

I
have
seen
her
naughtiness
all
along

*NL*
the
elder
said
jestingly
.
``
Why
have
you
been
laughing
at
Alexey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lise
had
in
fact
been
occupied
in
mocking
at
him
all
the
time
.
She
had
*NL*
noticed
before
that
Alyosha
was
shy
and
tried
not
to
look
at
her
,
and
she
*NL*
found
this
extremely
amusing
.
She
waited
intently
to
catch
his
eye
.
*NL*
Alyosha
,
unable
to
endure
her
persistent
stare
,
was
irresistibly
and
*NL*
suddenly
drawn
to
glance
at
her
,
and
at
once
she
smiled
triumphantly
in
*NL*
his
face
.
Alyosha
was
even
more
disconcerted
and
vexed
.
At
last
he
turned
*NL*
away
from
her
altogether
and
hid
behind
the
elder
's
back
.
After
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
drawn
by
the
same
irresistible
force
,
he
turned
again
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
was
being
looked
at
or
not
,
and
found
Lise
almost
hanging
out
*NL*
of
her
chair
to
peep
sideways
at
him
,
eagerly
waiting
for
him
to
look
.
*NL*
Catching
his
eye
,
she
laughed
so
that
the
elder
could
not
help
saying
,
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
make
fun
of
him
like
that
,
naughty
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lise
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
blushed
.
Her
eyes
flashed
and
her
*NL*
face
became
quite
serious
.
She
began
speaking
quickly
and
nervously
in
a
*NL*
warm
and
resentful
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
has
he
forgotten
everything
,
then
?
He
used
to
carry
me
about
when
I
*NL*
was
little
.
We
used
to
play
together
.
He
used
to
come
to
teach
me
to
read
,
*NL*
do
you
know
.
Two
years
ago
,
when
he
went
away
,
he
said
that
he
would
never
*NL*
forget
me
,
that
we
were
friends
for
ever
,
for
ever
,
for
ever
!
And
now
he
's
*NL*
afraid
of
me
all
at
once
.
Am
I
going
to
eat
him
?
Why
does
n't
he
want
to
*NL*
come
near
me
?
Why
does
n't
he
talk
?
Why
wo
n't
he
come
and
see
us
?
It
's
not
*NL*
that
you
wo
n't
let
him
.
We
know
that
he
goes
everywhere
.
It
's
not
good
*NL*
manners
for
me
to
invite
him
.
He
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
first
,
if
he
*NL*
has
n't
forgotten
me
.
No
,
now
he
's
saving
his
soul
!
Why
have
you
put
that
*NL*
long
gown
on
him
?
If
he
runs
he
'll
fall

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hand
and
went
off
into
irresistible
,
*NL*
prolonged
,
nervous
,
inaudible
laughter
.
The
elder
listened
to
her
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
blessed
her
tenderly
.
As
she
kissed
his
hand
she
suddenly
*NL*
pressed
it
to
her
eyes
and
began
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
I
'm
silly
and
good
for
nothing
...
and
perhaps
*NL*
Alyosha
's
right
,
quite
right
,
in
not
wanting
to
come
and
see
such
a
*NL*
ridiculous
girl
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
certainly
send

The
elder
's
absence
from
his
cell
had
lasted
for
about
twenty-five
*NL*
minutes
.
It
was
more
than
half-past
twelve
,
but
Dmitri
,
on
whose
account
*NL*
they
had
all
met
there
,
had
still
not
appeared
.
But
he
seemed
almost
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
when
the
elder
entered
the
cell
again
,
he
found
his
guests
*NL*
engaged
in
eager
conversation
.
Ivan
and
the
two
monks
took
the
leading
*NL*
share
in
it
.
Miuesov
,
too
,
was
trying
to
take
a
part
,
and
apparently
very
*NL*
eagerly
,
in
the
conversation
.
But
he
was
unsuccessful
in
this
also
.
He
was
*NL*
evidently
in
the
background
,
and
his
remarks
were
treated
with
neglect
,
*NL*
which
increased
his
irritability
.
He
had
had
intellectual
encounters
with
*NL*
Ivan
before
and
he
could
not
endure
a
certain
carelessness
Ivan
showed
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hitherto
at
least
I
have
stood
in
the
front
ranks
of
all
that
is
*NL*
progressive
in
Europe
,
and
here
the
new
generation
positively
ignores
us
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
had
given
his
word
to
sit
still
and
be
quiet
,
had
*NL*
actually
been
quiet
for
some
time
,
but
he
watched
his
neighbor
Miuesov
with
*NL*
an
ironical
little
smile
,
obviously
enjoying
his
discomfiture
.
He
had
been
*NL*
waiting
for
some
time
to
pay
off
old
scores
,
and
now
he
could
not
let
the
*NL*
opportunity
slip
.
Bending
over
his
shoulder
he
began
teasing
him
again
in
*NL*
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
go
away
just
now
,
after
the
`
courteously
kissing
'
?
Why
did
*NL*
you
consent
to
remain
in
such
unseemly
company
?
It
was
because
you
felt
*NL*
insulted
and
aggrieved
,
and
you
remained
to
vindicate
yourself
by
showing
*NL*
off
your
intelligence
.
Now
you
wo
n't
go
till
you
've
displayed
your
*NL*
intellect
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
again
?
...
On
the
contrary
,
I
'm
just
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
the
last
,
the
last
of
all
to
go
!
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
delivered
*NL*
him
another
thrust
,
almost
at
the
moment
of
Father
Zossima
's
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
died
down
for
a
moment
,
but
the
elder
,
seating
himself
in
*NL*
his
former
place
,
looked
at
them
all
as
though
cordially
inviting
them
to
*NL*
go
on
.
Alyosha
,
who
knew
every
expression
of
his
face
,
saw
that
he
was
*NL*
fearfully
exhausted
and
making
a
great
effort
.
Of
late
he
had
been
liable
*NL*
to
fainting
fits
from
exhaustion
.
His
face
had
the
pallor
that
was
common
*NL*
before
such
attacks
,
and
his
lips
were
white
.
But
he
evidently
did
not
*NL*
want
to
break
up
the
party
.
He
seemed
to
have
some
special
object
of
his
*NL*
own
in
keeping
them
.
What
object
?
Alyosha
watched
him
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
discussing
this
gentleman
's
most
interesting
article
,
''
said
Father
*NL*
Iosif
,
the
librarian
,
addressing
the
elder
,
and
indicating
Ivan
.
``
He
*NL*
brings
forward
much
that
is
new
,
but
I
think
the
argument
cuts
both
ways
.
*NL*
It
is
an
article
written
in
answer
to
a
book
by
an
ecclesiastical
*NL*
authority
on
the
question
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
,
and
the
scope
of
*NL*
its
jurisdiction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
I
have
not
read
your
article
,
but
I
've
heard
of
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
elder
,
looking
keenly
and
intently
at
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
takes
up
a
most
interesting
position
,
''
continued
the
Father
Librarian
.
*NL*
``
As
far
as
Church
jurisdiction
is
concerned
he
is
apparently
quite
opposed
*NL*
to
the
separation
of
Church
from
State

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
interesting
.
But
in
what
sense
?
''
Father
Zossima
asked
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
,
at
last
,
answered
him
,
not
condescendingly
,
as
Alyosha
had
*NL*
feared
,
but
with
modesty
and
reserve
,
with
evident
goodwill
and
apparently
*NL*
without
the
slightest
_
arriere-pensee
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
start
from
the
position
that
this
confusion
of
elements
,
that
is
,
of
*NL*
the
essential
principles
of
Church
and
State
,
will
,
of
course
,
go
on
for
*NL*
ever
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
mingle
,
and
*NL*
that
the
confusion
of
these
elements
can
not
lead
to
any
consistent
or
even
*NL*
normal
results
,
for
there
is
falsity
at
the
very
foundation
of
it

*NL*
Compromise
between
the
Church
and
State
in
such
questions
as
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
jurisdiction
,
is
,
to
my
thinking
,
impossible
in
any
real
sense
.
*NL*
My
clerical
opponent
maintains
that
the
Church
holds
a
precise
and
defined
*NL*
position
in
the
State
.
I
maintain
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
Church
ought
*NL*
to
include
the
whole
State

not
simply
to
occupy
a
corner
in
it
,
and
,
*NL*
if
this
is
,
for
some
reason
,
impossible
at
present
,
then
it
ought
,
in
*NL*
reality
,
to
be
set
up
as
the
direct
and
chief
aim
of
the
future
*NL*
development
of
Christian
society
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
true
,
''
Father
Paissy
,
the
silent
and
learned
monk
,
assented
*NL*
with
fervor
and
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
purest
Ultramontanism
!
''
cried
Miuesov
impatiently
,
crossing
and
*NL*
recrossing
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
we
have
no
mountains
,
''
cried
Father
Iosif
,
and
turning
to
the
*NL*
elder
he
continued
:
``
Observe
the
answer
he
makes
to
the
following
*NL*
`
fundamental
and
essential
'
propositions
of
his
opponent
,
who
is
,
you
must
*NL*
note
,
an
ecclesiastic
.
First
,
that
`
no
social
organization
can
or
ought
to
*NL*
arrogate
to
itself
power
to
dispose
of
the
civic
and
political
rights
of
*NL*
its
members
.
'
Secondly
,
that
`
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
ought
not
to
*NL*
belong
to
the
Church
,
and
is
inconsistent
with
its
nature
,
both
as
a
*NL*
divine
institution
and
as
an
organization
of
men
for
religious
objects
,
'
*NL*
and
,
finally
,
in
the
third
place
,
`
the
Church
is
a
kingdom
not
of
this
*NL*
world
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
unworthy
play
upon
words
for
an
ecclesiastic
!
''
Father
Paissy
could
*NL*
not
refrain
from
breaking
in
again
.
``
I
have
read
the
book
which
you
have
*NL*
answered
,
''
he
added
,
addressing
Ivan
,
``
and
was
astounded
at
the
words
`
the
*NL*
Church
is
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
.
'
If
it
is
not
of
this
world
,
then
*NL*
it
can
not
exist
on
earth
at
all
.
In
the
Gospel
,
the
words
`
not
of
this
*NL*
world
'
are
not
used
in
that
sense
.
To
play
with
such
words
is
*NL*
indefensible
.
Our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
came
to
set
up
the
Church
upon
earth
.
*NL*
The
Kingdom
of
Heaven
,
of
course
,
is
not
of
this
world
,
but
in
Heaven
;
but
*NL*
it
is
only
entered
through
the
Church
which
has
been
founded
and
*NL*
established
upon
earth
.
And
so
a
frivolous
play
upon
words
in
such
a
*NL*
connection
is
unpardonable
and
improper
.
The
Church
is
,
in
truth
,
a
*NL*
kingdom
and
ordained
to
rule
,
and
in
the
end
must
undoubtedly
become
the
*NL*
kingdom
ruling
over
all
the
earth
.
For
that
we
have
the
divine
promise

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
speaking
suddenly
,
as
though
checking
himself
.
After
listening
*NL*
attentively
and
respectfully
Ivan
went
on
,
addressing
the
elder
with
*NL*
perfect
composure
and
as
before
with
ready
cordiality
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
point
of
my
article
lies
in
the
fact
that
during
the
first
*NL*
three
centuries
Christianity
only
existed
on
earth
in
the
Church
and
was
*NL*
nothing
but
the
Church
.
When
the
pagan
Roman
Empire
desired
to
become
*NL*
Christian
,
it
inevitably
happened
that
,
by
becoming
Christian
,
it
included
*NL*
the
Church
but
remained
a
pagan
State
in
very
many
of
its
departments
.
In
*NL*
reality
this
was
bound
to
happen
.
But
Rome
as
a
State
retained
too
much
of
*NL*
the
pagan
civilization
and
culture
,
as
,
for
example
,
in
the
very
objects
*NL*
and
fundamental
principles
of
the
State
.
The
Christian
Church
entering
*NL*
into
the
State
could
,
of
course
,
surrender
no
part
of
its
fundamental
*NL*
principles
--
the
rock
on
which
it
stands
--
and
could
pursue
no
other
aims
than
*NL*
those
which
have
been
ordained
and
revealed
by
God
Himself
,
and
among
them
*NL*
that
of
drawing
the
whole
world
,
and
therefore
the
ancient
pagan
State
*NL*
itself
,
into
the
Church
.
In
that
way
-LRB-
that
is
,
with
a
view
to
the
future
-RRB-
*NL*
it
is
not
the
Church
that
should
seek
a
definite
position
in
the
State
,
*NL*
like
`
every
social
organization
,
'
or
as
`
an
organization
of
men
for
*NL*
religious
purposes
'
-LRB-
as
my
opponent
calls
the
Church
-RRB-
,
but
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
every
earthly
State
should
be
,
in
the
end
,
completely
*NL*
transformed
into
the
Church
and
should
become
nothing
else
but
a
Church
,
*NL*
rejecting
every
purpose
incongruous
with
the
aims
of
the
Church
.
All
this
*NL*
will
not
degrade
it
in
any
way
or
take
from
its
honor
and
glory
as
a
great
*NL*
State
,
nor
from
the
glory
of
its
rulers
,
but
only
turns
it
from
a
false
,
*NL*
still
pagan
,
and
mistaken
path
to
the
true
and
rightful
path
,
which
alone
*NL*
leads
to
the
eternal
goal
.
This
is
why
the
author
of
the
book
_
On
the
*NL*
Foundations
of
Church
Jurisdiction
_
would
have
judged
correctly
if
,
in
*NL*
seeking
and
laying
down
those
foundations
,
he
had
looked
upon
them
as
a
*NL*
temporary
compromise
inevitable
in
our
sinful
and
imperfect
days
.
But
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
author
ventures
to
declare
that
the
foundations
which
he
*NL*
predicates
now
,
part
of
which
Father
Iosif
just
enumerated
,
are
the
*NL*
permanent
,
essential
,
and
eternal
foundations
,
he
is
going
directly
*NL*
against
the
Church
and
its
sacred
and
eternal
vocation
.
That
is
the
gist
*NL*
of
my
article
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
in
brief
,
''
Father
Paissy
began
again
,
laying
stress
on
each
*NL*
word
,
``
according
to
certain
theories
only
too
clearly
formulated
in
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
,
the
Church
ought
to
be
transformed
into
the
State
,
as
*NL*
though
this
would
be
an
advance
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
form
,
so
as
to
*NL*
disappear
into
it
,
making
way
for
science
,
for
the
spirit
of
the
age
,
and
*NL*
civilization
.
And
if
the
Church
resists
and
is
unwilling
,
some
corner
will
*NL*
be
set
apart
for
her
in
the
State
,
and
even
that
under
control
--
and
this
*NL*
will
be
so
everywhere
in
all
modern
European
countries
.
But
Russian
hopes
*NL*
and
conceptions
demand
not
that
the
Church
should
pass
as
from
a
lower
*NL*
into
a
higher
type
into
the
State
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
State
*NL*
should
end
by
being
worthy
to
become
only
the
Church
and
nothing
else
.
So
*NL*
be
it
!
So
be
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
confess
you
've
reassured
me
somewhat
,
''
Miuesov
said
smiling
,
again
*NL*
crossing
his
legs
.
``
So
far
as
I
understand
,
then
,
the
realization
of
such
*NL*
an
ideal
is
infinitely
remote
,
at
the
second
coming
of
Christ
.
That
's
as
*NL*
you
please
.
It
's
a
beautiful
Utopian
dream
of
the
abolition
of
war
,
*NL*
diplomacy
,
banks
,
and
so
on
--
something
after
the
fashion
of
socialism
,
*NL*
indeed
.
But
I
imagined
that
it
was
all
meant
seriously
,
and
that
the
*NL*
Church
might
be
_
now
_
going
to
try
criminals
,
and
sentence
them
to
*NL*
beating
,
prison
,
and
even
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
there
were
none
but
the
ecclesiastical
court
,
the
Church
would
not
*NL*
even
now
sentence
a
criminal
to
prison
or
to
death
.
Crime
and
the
way
of
*NL*
regarding
it
would
inevitably
change
,
not
all
at
once
of
course
,
but
*NL*
fairly
soon
,
''
Ivan
replied
calmly
,
without
flinching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
serious
?
''
Miuesov
glanced
keenly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
everything
became
the
Church
,
the
Church
would
exclude
all
the
*NL*
criminal
and
disobedient
,
and
would
not
cut
off
their
heads
,
''
Ivan
went
*NL*
on
.
``
I
ask
you
,
what
would
become
of
the
excluded
?
He
would
be
cut
off
*NL*
then
not
only
from
men
,
as
now
,
but
from
Christ
.
By
his
crime
he
would
*NL*
have
transgressed
not
only
against
men
but
against
the
Church
of
Christ
.
*NL*
This
is
so
even
now
,
of
course
,
strictly
speaking
,
but
it
is
not
clearly
*NL*
enunciated
,
and
very
,
very
often
the
criminal
of
to-day
compromises
with
*NL*
his
conscience
:
'
I
steal
,
'
he
says
,
`
but
I
do
n't
go
against
the
Church
.
*NL*
I
'm
not
an
enemy
of
Christ
.
'
That
's
what
the
criminal
of
to-day
is
*NL*
continually
saying
to
himself
,
but
when
the
Church
takes
the
place
of
the
*NL*
State
it
will
be
difficult
for
him
,
in
opposition
to
the
Church
all
over
*NL*
the
world
,
to
say
:
`
All
men
are
mistaken
,
all
in
error
,
all
mankind
are
*NL*
the
false
Church
.
I
,
a
thief
and
murderer
,
am
the
only
true
Christian
*NL*
Church
.
'
It
will
be
very
difficult
to
say
this
to
himself
;
it
requires
a
*NL*
rare
combination
of
unusual
circumstances
.
Now
,
on
the
other
side
,
take
*NL*
the
Church
's
own
view
of
crime
:
is
it
not
bound
to
renounce
the
present
*NL*
almost
pagan
attitude
,
and
to
change
from
a
mechanical
cutting
off
of
its
*NL*
tainted
member
for
the
preservation
of
society
,
as
at
present
,
into
*NL*
completely
and
honestly
adopting
the
idea
of
the
regeneration
of
the
man
,
*NL*
of
his
reformation
and
salvation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
fail
to
understand
again
,
''
Miuesov
interrupted
.
``
Some
*NL*
sort
of
dream
again
.
Something
shapeless
and
even
incomprehensible
.
What
*NL*
is
excommunication
?
What
sort
of
exclusion
?
I
suspect
you
are
simply
*NL*
amusing
yourself
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
know
,
in
reality
it
is
so
now
,
''
said
the
elder
suddenly
,
and
*NL*
all
turned
to
him
at
once
.
``
If
it
were
not
for
the
Church
of
Christ
there
*NL*
would
be
nothing
to
restrain
the
criminal
from
evil-doing
,
no
real
*NL*
chastisement
for
it
afterwards
;
none
,
that
is
,
but
the
mechanical
*NL*
punishment
spoken
of
just
now
,
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
only
*NL*
embitters
the
heart
;
and
not
the
real
punishment
,
the
only
effectual
one
,
*NL*
the
only
deterrent
and
softening
one
,
which
lies
in
the
recognition
of
sin
*NL*
by
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
,
may
one
inquire
?
''
asked
Miuesov
,
with
lively
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
began
the
elder
,
``
all
these
sentences
to
exile
with
hard
labor
,
and
*NL*
formerly
with
flogging
also
,
reform
no
one
,
and
what
's
more
,
deter
hardly
*NL*
a
single
criminal
,
and
the
number
of
crimes
does
not
diminish
but
is
*NL*
continually
on
the
increase
.
You
must
admit
that
.
Consequently
the
*NL*
security
of
society
is
not
preserved
,
for
,
although
the
obnoxious
member
*NL*
is
mechanically
cut
off
and
sent
far
away
out
of
sight
,
another
criminal
*NL*
always
comes
to
take
his
place
at
once
,
and
often
two
of
them
.
If
anything
*NL*
does
preserve
society
,
even
in
our
time
,
and
does
regenerate
and
transform
*NL*
the
criminal
,
it
is
only
the
law
of
Christ
speaking
in
his
conscience
.
It
*NL*
is
only
by
recognizing
his
wrong-doing
as
a
son
of
a
Christian
*NL*
society
--
that
is
,
of
the
Church
--
that
he
recognizes
his
sin
against
*NL*
society
--
that
is
,
against
the
Church
.
So
that
it
is
only
against
the
*NL*
Church
,
and
not
against
the
State
,
that
the
criminal
of
to-day
can
*NL*
recognize
that
he
has
sinned
.
If
society
,
as
a
Church
,
had
jurisdiction
,
*NL*
then
it
would
know
when
to
bring
back
from
exclusion
and
to
reunite
to
*NL*
itself
.
Now
the
Church
having
no
real
jurisdiction
,
but
only
the
power
of
*NL*
moral
condemnation
,
withdraws
of
her
own
accord
from
punishing
the
*NL*
criminal
actively
.
She
does
not
excommunicate
him
but
simply
persists
in
*NL*
motherly
exhortation
of
him
.
What
is
more
,
the
Church
even
tries
to
*NL*
preserve
all
Christian
communion
with
the
criminal
.
She
admits
him
to
*NL*
church
services
,
to
the
holy
sacrament
,
gives
him
alms
,
and
treats
him
*NL*
more
as
a
captive
than
as
a
convict
.
And
what
would
become
of
the
*NL*
criminal
,
O
Lord
,
if
even
the
Christian
society
--
that
is
,
the
Church
--
were
*NL*
to
reject
him
even
as
the
civil
law
rejects
him
and
cuts
him
off
?
What
*NL*
would
become
of
him
if
the
Church
punished
him
with
her
excommunication
as
*NL*
the
direct
consequence
of
the
secular
law
?
There
could
be
no
more
terrible
*NL*
despair
,
at
least
for
a
Russian
criminal
,
for
Russian
criminals
still
have
*NL*
faith
.
Though
,
who
knows
,
perhaps
then
a
fearful
thing
would
happen
,
*NL*
perhaps
the
despairing
heart
of
the
criminal
would
lose
its
faith
and
then
*NL*
what
would
become
of
him
?
But
the
Church
,
like
a
tender
,
loving
mother
,
*NL*
holds
aloof
from
active
punishment
herself
,
as
the
sinner
is
too
severely
*NL*
punished
already
by
the
civil
law
,
and
there
must
be
at
least
some
one
to
*NL*
have
pity
on
him
.
The
Church
holds
aloof
,
above
all
,
because
its
judgment
*NL*
is
the
only
one
that
contains
the
truth
,
and
therefore
can
not
practically
*NL*
and
morally
be
united
to
any
other
judgment
even
as
a
temporary
*NL*
compromise
.
She
can
enter
into
no
compact
about
that
.
The
foreign
*NL*
criminal
,
they
say
,
rarely
repents
,
for
the
very
doctrines
of
to-day
*NL*
confirm
him
in
the
idea
that
his
crime
is
not
a
crime
,
but
only
a
reaction
*NL*
against
an
unjustly
oppressive
force
.
Society
cuts
him
off
completely
by
a
*NL*
force
that
triumphs
over
him
mechanically
and
-LRB-
so
at
least
they
say
of
*NL*
themselves
in
Europe
-RRB-
accompanies
this
exclusion
with
hatred
,
*NL*
forgetfulness
,
and
the
most
profound
indifference
as
to
the
ultimate
fate
*NL*
of
the
erring
brother
.
In
this
way
,
it
all
takes
place
without
the
*NL*
compassionate
intervention
of
the
Church
,
for
in
many
cases
there
are
no
*NL*
churches
there
at
all
,
for
though
ecclesiastics
and
splendid
church
*NL*
buildings
remain
,
the
churches
themselves
have
long
ago
striven
to
pass
*NL*
from
Church
into
State
and
to
disappear
in
it
completely
.
So
it
seems
at
*NL*
least
in
Lutheran
countries
.
As
for
Rome
,
it
was
proclaimed
a
State
*NL*
instead
of
a
Church
a
thousand
years
ago
.
And
so
the
criminal
is
no
longer
*NL*
conscious
of
being
a
member
of
the
Church
and
sinks
into
despair
.
If
he
*NL*
returns
to
society
,
often
it
is
with
such
hatred
that
society
itself
*NL*
instinctively
cuts
him
off
.
You
can
judge
for
yourself
how
it
must
end
.
In
*NL*
many
cases
it
would
seem
to
be
the
same
with
us
,
but
the
difference
is
*NL*
that
besides
the
established
law
courts
we
have
the
Church
too
,
which
*NL*
always
keeps
up
relations
with
the
criminal
as
a
dear
and
still
precious
*NL*
son
.
And
besides
that
,
there
is
still
preserved
,
though
only
in
thought
,
*NL*
the
judgment
of
the
Church
,
which
though
no
longer
existing
in
practice
is
*NL*
still
living
as
a
dream
for
the
future
,
and
is
,
no
doubt
,
instinctively
*NL*
recognized
by
the
criminal
in
his
soul
.
What
was
said
here
just
now
is
*NL*
true
too
,
that
is
,
that
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Church
were
introduced
*NL*
in
practice
in
its
full
force
,
that
is
,
if
the
whole
of
the
society
were
*NL*
changed
into
the
Church
,
not
only
the
judgment
of
the
Church
would
have
*NL*
influence
on
the
reformation
of
the
criminal
such
as
it
never
has
now
,
but
*NL*
possibly
also
the
crimes
themselves
would
be
incredibly
diminished
.
And
*NL*
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
Church
would
look
upon
the
criminal
and
the
*NL*
crime
of
the
future
in
many
cases
quite
differently
and
would
succeed
in
*NL*
restoring
the
excluded
,
in
restraining
those
who
plan
evil
,
and
in
*NL*
regenerating
the
fallen
.
It
is
true
,
''
said
Father
Zossima
,
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
``
the
Christian
society
now
is
not
ready
and
is
only
resting
on
some
seven
*NL*
righteous
men
,
but
as
they
are
never
lacking
,
it
will
continue
still
*NL*
unshaken
in
expectation
of
its
complete
transformation
from
a
society
*NL*
almost
heathen
in
character
into
a
single
universal
and
all-powerful
*NL*
Church
.
So
be
it
,
so
be
it
!
Even
though
at
the
end
of
the
ages
,
for
it
is
*NL*
ordained
to
come
to
pass
!
And
there
is
no
need
to
be
troubled
about
times
*NL*
and
seasons
,
for
the
secret
of
the
times
and
seasons
is
in
the
wisdom
of
*NL*

,
in
His
foresight
,
and
His
love
.
And
what
in
human
reckoning
seems
*NL*
still
afar
off
,
may
by
the
Divine
ordinance
be
close
at
hand
,
on
the
eve
*NL*
of
its
appearance
.
And
so
be
it
,
so
be
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
so
be
it
!
''
Father
Paissy
repeated
austerely
and
reverently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
,
extremely
strange
!
''
Miuesov
pronounced
,
not
so
much
with
heat
as
*NL*
with
latent
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
strikes
you
as
so
strange
?
''
Father
Iosif
inquired
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
beyond
anything
!
''
cried
Miuesov
,
suddenly
breaking
out
;
``
the
*NL*
State
is
eliminated
and
the
Church
is
raised
to
the
position
of
the
State
.
*NL*
It
's
not
simply
Ultramontanism
,
it
's
arch-Ultramontanism
!
It
's
beyond
the
*NL*
dreams
of
Pope
Gregory
the
Seventh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
completely
misunderstanding
it
,
''
said
Father
Paissy
sternly
.
*NL*
``
Understand
,
the
Church
is
not
to
be
transformed
into
the
State
.
That
is
*NL*
Rome
and
its
dream
.
That
is
the
third
temptation
of
the
devil
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
the
State
is
transformed
into
the
Church
,
will
ascend
and
become
*NL*
a
Church
over
the
whole
world
--
which
is
the
complete
opposite
of
*NL*
Ultramontanism
and
Rome
,
and
your
interpretation
,
and
is
only
the
glorious
*NL*
destiny
ordained
for
the
Orthodox
Church
.
This
star
will
arise
in
the
*NL*
east
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miuesov
was
significantly
silent
.
His
whole
figure
expressed
extraordinary
*NL*
personal
dignity
.
A
supercilious
and
condescending
smile
played
on
his
*NL*
lips
.
Alyosha
watched
it
all
with
a
throbbing
heart
.
The
whole
*NL*
conversation
stirred
him
profoundly
.
He
glanced
casually
at
Rakitin
,
who
*NL*
was
standing
immovable
in
his
place
by
the
door
listening
and
watching
*NL*
intently
though
with
downcast
eyes
.
But
from
the
color
in
his
cheeks
*NL*
Alyosha
guessed
that
Rakitin
was
probably
no
less
excited
,
and
he
knew
*NL*
what
caused
his
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
tell
you
one
little
anecdote
,
gentlemen
,
''
Miuesov
said
*NL*
impressively
,
with
a
peculiarly
majestic
air
.
``
Some
years
ago
,
soon
after
*NL*
the
_
coup
d'etat
_
of
December
,
I
happened
to
be
calling
in
Paris
on
an
*NL*
extremely
influential
personage
in
the
Government
,
and
I
met
a
very
*NL*
interesting
man
in
his
house
.
This
individual
was
not
precisely
a
*NL*
detective
but
was
a
sort
of
superintendent
of
a
whole
regiment
of
*NL*
political
detectives
--
a
rather
powerful
position
in
its
own
way
.
I
was
*NL*
prompted
by
curiosity
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
conversation
with
him
.
*NL*
And
as
he
had
not
come
as
a
visitor
but
as
a
subordinate
official
bringing
*NL*
a
special
report
,
and
as
he
saw
the
reception
given
me
by
his
chief
,
he
*NL*
deigned
to
speak
with
some
openness
,
to
a
certain
extent
only
,
of
course
.
*NL*
He
was
rather
courteous
than
open
,
as
Frenchmen
know
how
to
be
courteous
,
*NL*
especially
to
a
foreigner
.
But
I
thoroughly
understood
him
.
The
subject
*NL*
was
the
socialist
revolutionaries
who
were
at
that
time
persecuted
.
I
will
*NL*
quote
only
one
most
curious
remark
dropped
by
this
person
.
`
We
are
not
*NL*
particularly
afraid
,
'
said
he
,
`
of
all
these
socialists
,
anarchists
,
*NL*
infidels
,
and
revolutionists
;
we
keep
watch
on
them
and
know
all
their
*NL*
goings
on
.
But
there
are
a
few
peculiar
men
among
them
who
believe
in
God
*NL*
and
are
Christians
,
but
at
the
same
time
are
socialists
.
These
are
the
*NL*
people
we
are
most
afraid
of
.
They
are
dreadful
people
!
The
socialist
who
*NL*
is
a
Christian
is
more
to
be
dreaded
than
a
socialist
who
is
an
atheist
.
'
*NL*
The
words
struck
me
at
the
time
,
and
now
they
have
suddenly
come
back
to
*NL*
me
here
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
apply
them
to
us
,
and
look
upon
us
as
socialists
?
''
Father
Paissy
*NL*
asked
directly
,
without
beating
about
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
could
think
what
to
answer
,
the
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
the
guest
so
long
expected
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
came
in
.
They
*NL*
had
,
in
fact
,
given
up
expecting
him
,
and
his
sudden
appearance
caused
*NL*
some
surprise
for
a
moment
.

*NL*
Chapter
VI
.
Why
Is
Such
A
Man
Alive
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
a
young
man
of
eight
and
twenty
,
of
medium
height
and
*NL*
agreeable
countenance
,
looked
older
than
his
years
.
He
was
muscular
,
and
*NL*
showed
signs
of
considerable
physical
strength
.
Yet
there
was
something
*NL*
not
healthy
in
his
face
.
It
was
rather
thin
,
his
cheeks
were
hollow
,
and
*NL*
there
was
an
unhealthy
sallowness
in
their
color
.
His
rather
large
,
*NL*
prominent
,
dark
eyes
had
an
expression
of
firm
determination
,
and
yet
*NL*
there
was
a
vague
look
in
them
,
too
.
Even
when
he
was
excited
and
talking
*NL*
irritably
,
his
eyes
somehow
did
not
follow
his
mood
,
but
betrayed
*NL*
something
else
,
sometimes
quite
incongruous
with
what
was
passing
.
``
It
's
*NL*
hard
to
tell
what
he
's
thinking
,
''
those
who
talked
to
him
sometimes
*NL*
declared
.
People
who
saw
something
pensive
and
sullen
in
his
eyes
were
*NL*
startled
by
his
sudden
laugh
,
which
bore
witness
to
mirthful
and
light
-
*NL*
hearted
thoughts
at
the
very
time
when
his
eyes
were
so
gloomy
.
A
certain
*NL*
strained
look
in
his
face
was
easy
to
understand
at
this
moment
.
Every
one
*NL*
knew
,
or
had
heard
of
,
the
extremely
restless
and
dissipated
life
which
he
*NL*
had
been
leading
of
late
,
as
well
as
of
the
violent
anger
to
which
he
had
*NL*
been
roused
in
his
quarrels
with
his
father
.
There
were
several
stories
*NL*
current
in
the
town
about
it
.
It
is
true
that
he
was
irascible
by
nature
,
*NL*
``
of
an
unstable
and
unbalanced
mind
,
''
as
our
justice
of
the
peace
,
*NL*
Katchalnikov
,
happily
described
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
stylishly
and
irreproachably
dressed
in
a
carefully
buttoned
frock
-
*NL*
coat
.
He
wore
black
gloves
and
carried
a
top-hat
.
Having
only
lately
left
*NL*
the
army
,
he
still
had
mustaches
and
no
beard
.
His
dark
brown
hair
was
*NL*
cropped
short
,
and
combed
forward
on
his
temples
.
He
had
the
long
,
*NL*
determined
stride
of
a
military
man
.
He
stood
still
for
a
moment
on
the
*NL*
threshold
,
and
glancing
at
the
whole
party
went
straight
up
to
the
elder
,
*NL*
guessing
him
to
be
their
host
.
He
made
him
a
low
bow
,
and
asked
his
*NL*
blessing
.
Father
Zossima
,
rising
in
his
chair
,
blessed
him
.
Dmitri
kissed
*NL*
his
hand
respectfully
,
and
with
intense
feeling
,
almost
anger
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
so
generous
as
to
forgive
me
for
having
kept
you
waiting
so
long
,
but
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
the
valet
sent
me
by
my
father
,
in
reply
to
my
inquiries
,
told
*NL*
me
twice
over
that
the
appointment
was
for
one
.
Now
I
suddenly
learn
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
''
interposed
the
elder
.
``
No
matter
.
You
are
a
*NL*
little
late
.
It
's
of
no
consequence
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
extremely
obliged
to
you
,
and
expected
no
less
from
your
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
this
,
Dmitri
bowed
once
more
.
Then
,
turning
suddenly
towards
his
*NL*
father
,
made
him
,
too
,
a
similarly
low
and
respectful
bow
.
He
had
*NL*
evidently
considered
it
beforehand
,
and
made
this
bow
in
all
seriousness
,
*NL*
thinking
it
his
duty
to
show
his
respect
and
good
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
taken
unawares
,
he
was
equal
to
the
*NL*
occasion
.
In
response
to
Dmitri
's
bow
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
made
*NL*
his
son
a
bow
as
low
in
return
.
His
face
was
suddenly
solemn
and
*NL*
impressive
,
which
gave
him
a
positively
malignant
look
.
Dmitri
bowed
*NL*
generally
to
all
present
,
and
without
a
word
walked
to
the
window
with
his
*NL*
long
,
resolute
stride
,
sat
down
on
the
only
empty
chair
,
near
Father
*NL*
Paissy
,
and
,
bending
forward
,
prepared
to
listen
to
the
conversation
he
*NL*
had
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
's
entrance
had
taken
no
more
than
two
minutes
,
and
the
conversation
*NL*
was
resumed
.
But
this
time
Miuesov
thought
it
unnecessary
to
reply
to
*NL*
Father
Paissy
's
persistent
and
almost
irritable
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
withdraw
from
this
discussion
,
''
he
observed
with
a
certain
*NL*
well-bred
nonchalance
.
``
It
's
a
subtle
question
,
too
.
Here
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
is
smiling
at
us
.
He
must
have
something
interesting
to
say
*NL*
about
that
also
.
Ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
special
,
except
one
little
remark
,
''
Ivan
replied
at
once
.
*NL*
``
European
Liberals
in
general
,
and
even
our
liberal
dilettanti
,
often
mix
*NL*
up
the
final
results
of
socialism
with
those
of
Christianity
.
This
wild
*NL*
notion
is
,
of
course
,
a
characteristic
feature
.
But
it
's
not
only
Liberals
*NL*
and
dilettanti
who
mix
up
socialism
and
Christianity
,
but
,
in
many
cases
,
*NL*
it
appears
,
the
police
--
the
foreign
police
,
of
course
--
do
the
same
.
Your
*NL*
Paris
anecdote
is
rather
to
the
point
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
permission
to
drop
this
subject
altogether
,
''
Miuesov
repeated
.
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
instead
,
gentlemen
,
another
interesting
and
rather
*NL*
characteristic
anecdote
of
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
himself
.
Only
five
days
ago
,
*NL*
in
a
gathering
here
,
principally
of
ladies
,
he
solemnly
declared
in
*NL*
argument
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
whole
world
to
make
men
love
their
*NL*
neighbors
.
That
there
was
no
law
of
nature
that
man
should
love
mankind
,
*NL*
and
that
,
if
there
had
been
any
love
on
earth
hitherto
,
it
was
not
owing
*NL*
to
a
natural
law
,
but
simply
because
men
have
believed
in
immortality
.
*NL*
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
added
in
parenthesis
that
the
whole
natural
law
lies
in
*NL*
that
faith
,
and
that
if
you
were
to
destroy
in
mankind
the
belief
in
*NL*
immortality
,
not
only
love
but
every
living
force
maintaining
the
life
of
*NL*
the
world
would
at
once
be
dried
up
.
Moreover
,
nothing
then
would
be
*NL*
immoral
,
everything
would
be
lawful
,
even
cannibalism
.
That
's
not
all
.
He
*NL*
ended
by
asserting
that
for
every
individual
,
like
ourselves
,
who
does
not
*NL*
believe
in
God
or
immortality
,
the
moral
law
of
nature
must
immediately
be
*NL*
changed
into
the
exact
contrary
of
the
former
religious
law
,
and
that
*NL*
egoism
,
even
to
crime
,
must
become
not
only
lawful
but
even
recognized
as
*NL*
the
inevitable
,
the
most
rational
,
even
honorable
outcome
of
his
position
.
*NL*
From
this
paradox
,
gentlemen
,
you
can
judge
of
the
rest
of
our
eccentric
*NL*
and
paradoxical
friend
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
's
theories
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
Dmitri
cried
suddenly
;
``
if
I
've
heard
aright
,
crime
must
not
*NL*
only
be
permitted
but
even
recognized
as
the
inevitable
and
the
most
*NL*
rational
outcome
of
his
position
for
every
infidel
!
Is
that
so
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
''
said
Father
Paissy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
remember
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
uttered
these
words
Dmitri
ceased
speaking
as
suddenly
as
he
had
*NL*
begun
.
Every
one
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
really
your
conviction
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
*NL*
disappearance
of
the
faith
in
immortality
?
''
the
elder
asked
Ivan
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
That
was
my
contention
.
There
is
no
virtue
if
there
is
no
*NL*
immortality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
blessed
in
believing
that
,
or
else
most
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
unhappy
?
''
Ivan
asked
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
in
all
probability
you
do
n't
believe
yourself
in
the
immortality
*NL*
of
your
soul
,
nor
in
what
you
have
written
yourself
in
your
article
on
*NL*
Church
jurisdiction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
right
!
...
But
I
was
n't
altogether
joking
,
''
Ivan
suddenly
*NL*
and
strangely
confessed
,
flushing
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
altogether
joking
.
That
's
true
.
The
question
is
still
*NL*
fretting
your
heart
,
and
not
answered
.
But
the
martyr
likes
sometimes
to
*NL*
divert
himself
with
his
despair
,
as
it
were
driven
to
it
by
despair
*NL*
itself
.
Meanwhile
,
in
your
despair
,
you
,
too
,
divert
yourself
with
*NL*
magazine
articles
,
and
discussions
in
society
,
though
you
do
n't
believe
*NL*
your
own
arguments
,
and
with
an
aching
heart
mock
at
them
inwardly
...
*NL*
That
question
you
have
not
answered
,
and
it
is
your
great
grief
,
for
it
*NL*
clamors
for
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
it
be
answered
by
me
?
Answered
in
the
affirmative
?
''
Ivan
went
on
*NL*
asking
strangely
,
still
looking
at
the
elder
with
the
same
inexplicable
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
ca
n't
be
decided
in
the
affirmative
,
it
will
never
be
decided
in
*NL*
the
negative
.
You
know
that
that
is
the
peculiarity
of
your
heart
,
and
all
*NL*
its
suffering
is
due
to
it
.
But
thank
the
Creator
who
has
given
you
a
*NL*
lofty
heart
capable
of
such
suffering
;
of
thinking
and
seeking
higher
*NL*
things
,
for
our
dwelling
is
in
the
heavens
.
God
grant
that
your
heart
will
*NL*
attain
the
answer
on
earth
,
and
may
God
bless
your
path

The
elder
raised
his
hand
and
would
have
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
*NL*
Ivan
from
where
he
stood
.
But
the
latter
rose
from
his
seat
,
went
up
to
*NL*
him
,
received
his
blessing
,
and
kissing
his
hand
went
back
to
his
place
in
*NL*
silence
.
His
face
looked
firm
and
earnest
.
This
action
and
all
the
*NL*
preceding
conversation
,
which
was
so
surprising
from
Ivan
,
impressed
every
*NL*
one
by
its
strangeness
and
a
certain
solemnity
,
so
that
all
were
silent
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
there
was
a
look
almost
of
apprehension
in
Alyosha
's
*NL*
face
.
But
Miuesov
suddenly
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
And
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
jumped
up
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
pious
and
holy
elder
,
''
he
cried
,
pointing
to
Ivan
,
``
that
is
my
son
,
*NL*
flesh
of
my
flesh

the
dearest
of
my
flesh
!
He
is
my
most
dutiful
Karl
*NL*
Moor
,
so
to
speak
,
while
this
son
who
has
just
come
in
,
Dmitri
,
against
*NL*
whom
I
am
seeking
justice
from
you
,
is
the
undutiful
Franz
Moor
--
they
are
*NL*
both
out
of
Schiller
's
_
Robbers
_
,
and
so
I
am
the
reigning
Count
von
Moor
!
*NL*
Judge
and
save
us
!
We
need
not
only
your
prayers
but
your
prophecies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
without
buffoonery
,
and
do
n't
begin
by
insulting
the
members
of
*NL*
your
family
,
''
answered
the
elder
,
in
a
faint
,
exhausted
voice
.
He
was
*NL*
obviously
getting
more
and
more
fatigued
,
and
his
strength
was
failing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
unseemly
farce
which
I
foresaw
when
I
came
here
!
''
cried
Dmitri
*NL*
indignantly
.
He
too
leapt
up
.
``
Forgive
it
,
reverend
Father
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
addressing
the
elder
.
``
I
am
not
a
cultivated
man
,
and
I
do
n't
even
know
*NL*
how
to
address
you
properly
,
but
you
have
been
deceived
and
you
have
been
*NL*
too
good-natured
in
letting
us
meet
here
.
All
my
father
wants
is
a
*NL*
scandal
.
Why
he
wants
it
only
he
can
tell
.
He
always
has
some
motive
.
But
*NL*
I
believe
I
know
why
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
all
blame
me
,
all
of
them

''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
``
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
here
blames
me
too
.
You
have
been
blaming
me
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
you
have
!
''
he
turned
suddenly
to
Miuesov
,
although
the
*NL*
latter
was
not
dreaming
of
interrupting
him
.
``
They
all
accuse
me
of
having
*NL*
hidden
the
children
's
money
in
my
boots
,
and
cheated
them
,
but
is
n't
there
*NL*
a
court
of
law
?
There
they
will
reckon
out
for
you
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
from
your
notes
,
your
letters
,
and
your
agreements
,
how
much
money
you
*NL*
had
,
how
much
you
have
spent
,
and
how
much
you
have
left
.
Why
does
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
refuse
to
pass
judgment
?
Dmitri
is
not
a
stranger
to
him
.
*NL*
Because
they
are
all
against
me
,
while
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
is
in
debt
to
*NL*
me
,
and
not
a
little
,
but
some
thousands
of
which
I
have
documentary
*NL*
proof
.
The
whole
town
is
echoing
with
his
debaucheries
.
And
where
he
was
*NL*
stationed
before
,
he
several
times
spent
a
thousand
or
two
for
the
*NL*
seduction
of
some
respectable
girl
;
we
know
all
about
that
,
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
in
its
most
secret
details
.
I
'll
prove
it
...
Would
you
*NL*
believe
it
,
holy
Father
,
he
has
captivated
the
heart
of
the
most
honorable
*NL*
of
young
ladies
of
good
family
and
fortune
,
daughter
of
a
gallant
colonel
,
*NL*
formerly
his
superior
officer
,
who
had
received
many
honors
and
had
the
*NL*
Anna
Order
on
his
breast
.
He
compromised
the
girl
by
his
promise
of
*NL*
marriage
,
now
she
is
an
orphan
and
here
;
she
is
betrothed
to
him
,
yet
*NL*
before
her
very
eyes
he
is
dancing
attendance
on
a
certain
enchantress
.
*NL*
And
although
this
enchantress
has
lived
in
,
so
to
speak
,
civil
marriage
*NL*
with
a
respectable
man
,
yet
she
is
of
an
independent
character
,
an
*NL*
unapproachable
fortress
for
everybody
,
just
like
a
legal
wife
--
for
she
is
*NL*
virtuous
,
yes
,
holy
Fathers
,
she
is
virtuous
.
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
wants
to
*NL*
open
this
fortress
with
a
golden
key
,
and
that
's
why
he
is
insolent
to
me
*NL*
now
,
trying
to
get
money
from
me
,
though
he
has
wasted
thousands
on
this
*NL*
enchantress
already
.
He
's
continually
borrowing
money
for
the
purpose
.
*NL*
From
whom
do
you
think
?
Shall
I
say
,
Mitya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
!
''
cried
Dmitri
,
``
wait
till
I
'm
gone
.
Do
n't
dare
in
my
presence
*NL*
to
asperse
the
good
name
of
an
honorable
girl
!
That
you
should
utter
a
*NL*
word
about
her
is
an
outrage
,
and
I
wo
n't
permit
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
!
Mitya
!
''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
hysterically
,
squeezing
out
a
*NL*
tear
.
``
And
is
your
father
's
blessing
nothing
to
you
?
If
I
curse
you
,
what
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shameless
hypocrite
!
''
exclaimed
Dmitri
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
that
to
his
father
!
his
father

What
would
he
be
with
others

*NL*
Gentlemen
,
only
fancy
;
there
's
a
poor
but
honorable
man
living
here
,
*NL*
burdened
with
a
numerous
family
,
a
captain
who
got
into
trouble
and
was
*NL*
discharged
from
the
army
,
but
not
publicly
,
not
by
court-martial
,
with
no
*NL*
slur
on
his
honor
.
And
three
weeks
ago
,
Dmitri
seized
him
by
the
beard
in
*NL*
a
tavern
,
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
and
beat
him
publicly
,
and
all
*NL*
because
he
is
an
agent
in
a
little
business
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
a
lie
!
Outwardly
it
's
the
truth
,
but
inwardly
a
lie
!
''
Dmitri
was
*NL*
trembling
with
rage
.
``
Father
,
I
do
n't
justify
my
action
.
Yes
,
I
confess
it
*NL*
publicly
,
I
behaved
like
a
brute
to
that
captain
,
and
I
regret
it
now
,
and
*NL*
I
'm
disgusted
with
myself
for
my
brutal
rage
.
But
this
captain
,
this
agent
*NL*
of
yours
,
went
to
that
lady
whom
you
call
an
enchantress
,
and
suggested
to
*NL*
her
from
you
,
that
she
should
take
I.O.U.
's
of
mine
which
were
in
your
*NL*
possession
,
and
should
sue
me
for
the
money
so
as
to
get
me
into
prison
by
*NL*
means
of
them
,
if
I
persisted
in
claiming
an
account
from
you
of
my
*NL*
property
.
Now
you
reproach
me
for
having
a
weakness
for
that
lady
when
you
*NL*
yourself
incited
her
to
captivate
me
!
She
told
me
so
to
my
face
...
She
*NL*
told
me
the
story
and
laughed
at
you
...
You
wanted
to
put
me
in
prison
*NL*
because
you
are
jealous
of
me
with
her
,
because
you
'd
begun
to
force
your
*NL*
attentions
upon
her
;
and
I
know
all
about
that
,
too
;
she
laughed
at
you
*NL*
for
that
as
well
--
you
hear
--
she
laughed
at
you
as
she
described
it
.
So
here
*NL*
you
have
this
man
,
this
father
who
reproaches
his
profligate
son
!
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
forgive
my
anger
,
but
I
foresaw
that
this
crafty
old
man
would
*NL*
only
bring
you
together
to
create
a
scandal
.
I
had
come
to
forgive
him
if
*NL*
he
held
out
his
hand
;
to
forgive
him
,
and
ask
forgiveness
!
But
as
he
has
*NL*
just
this
minute
insulted
not
only
me
,
but
an
honorable
young
lady
,
for
*NL*
whom
I
feel
such
reverence
that
I
dare
not
take
her
name
in
vain
,
I
have
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
to
show
up
his
game
,
though
he
is
my
father
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
go
on
.
His
eyes
were
glittering
and
he
breathed
with
*NL*
difficulty
.
But
every
one
in
the
cell
was
stirred
.
All
except
Father
*NL*
Zossima
got
up
from
their
seats
uneasily
.
The
monks
looked
austere
but
*NL*
waited
for
guidance
from
the
elder
.
He
sat
still
,
pale
,
not
from
*NL*
excitement
but
from
the
weakness
of
disease
.
An
imploring
smile
lighted
up
*NL*
his
face
;
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
hand
,
as
though
to
check
the
*NL*
storm
,
and
,
of
course
,
a
gesture
from
him
would
have
been
enough
to
end
*NL*
the
scene
;
but
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
and
watched
them
*NL*
intently
as
though
trying
to
make
out
something
which
was
not
perfectly
*NL*
clear
to
him
.
At
last
Miuesov
felt
completely
humiliated
and
disgraced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
to
blame
for
this
scandalous
scene
,
''
he
said
hotly
.
``
But
I
did
*NL*
not
foresee
it
when
I
came
,
though
I
knew
with
whom
I
had
to
deal
.
This
*NL*
must
be
stopped
at
once
!
Believe
me
,
your
reverence
,
I
had
no
precise
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
details
that
have
just
come
to
light
,
I
was
unwilling
to
*NL*
believe
them
,
and
I
learn
for
the
first
time
...
A
father
is
jealous
of
*NL*
his
son
's
relations
with
a
woman
of
loose
behavior
and
intrigues
with
the
*NL*
creature
to
get
his
son
into
prison
!
This
is
the
company
in
which
I
have
*NL*
been
forced
to
be
present
!
I
was
deceived
.
I
declare
to
you
all
that
I
was
*NL*
as
much
deceived
as
any
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
yelled
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
suddenly
,
in
an
unnatural
*NL*
voice
,
``
if
you
were
not
my
son
I
would
challenge
you
this
instant
to
a
*NL*
duel
...
with
pistols
,
at
three
paces
...
across
a
handkerchief
,
''
he
*NL*
ended
,
stamping
with
both
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
old
liars
who
have
been
acting
all
their
lives
there
are
moments
when
*NL*
they
enter
so
completely
into
their
part
that
they
tremble
or
shed
tears
*NL*
of
emotion
in
earnest
,
although
at
that
very
moment
,
or
a
second
later
,
*NL*
they
are
able
to
whisper
to
themselves
,
``
You

shameless
old

You
're

in

wrath

*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
frowned
painfully
,
and
looked
with
unutterable
contempt
at
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
...
I
thought

''
he
said
,
in
a
soft
and
,
as
it
were
,
controlled
*NL*
voice
,
``

profligate

a
despicable

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
duel

yelled
the
old
wretch
again
,
breathless
and
spluttering
at
each
*NL*
syllable
.
``
And
you

Pyotr
Alexandrovitch

And
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shameful

broke
from
Father
Iosif

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shameful

disgraceful

Kalganov
,
flushing
crimson
,
cried
in
a
boyish
*NL*
voice
,
trembling
with
emotion
.
He
had
been
silent
till
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
such
a
man
alive
?
''
Dmitri
,
beside
himself
with
rage
,
growled
in
a
*NL*
hollow
voice
,
hunching
up
his
shoulders
till
he
looked
almost
deformed
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
can
he
be
allowed
to
go

He
looked
round
*NL*
at
every
one
and
pointed
at
the
old
man

He
spoke
evenly
and
deliberately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

monks

Fyodor

rushing
up

shameful

That

of
loose
behavior

is
perhaps
*NL*
holier
than
you

monks

seeking
salvation

She
*NL*
fell
perhaps
in
her
youth
,
ruined
by
her
environment

But
she
loved
much
,
*NL*
and
Christ
himself
forgave
the
woman

loved
much

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not

impatiently
from

gentle
Father

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

and
think
you
are

You
eat
a
gudgeon
a
day
,
and
you
*NL*
think
you
bribe
God
with
gudgeon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
unendurable

was
heard
on
all
sides
in
the
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
unseemly
scene
was
cut
short
in
a
most
unexpected
way
.
Father
*NL*
Zossima
rose
suddenly
from
his
seat
.
Almost
distracted
with
anxiety
for
*NL*
the
elder
and
every
one
else
,
Alyosha
succeeded
,
however
,
in
supporting
*NL*
him
by
the
arm
.
Father
Zossima
moved
towards
Dmitri
and
reaching
him
sank
*NL*
on
his
knees
before
him
.
Alyosha
thought
that
he
had
fallen
from
weakness
,
*NL*
but
this
was
not
so
.
The
elder
distinctly
and
deliberately
bowed
down
at
*NL*
Dmitri
's
feet
till
his
forehead
touched
the
floor
.
Alyosha
was
so
*NL*
astounded
that
he
failed
to
assist
him
when
he
got
up
again
.
There
was
a
*NL*
faint
smile
on
his

he
said
,
bowing
on
all
sides
to
his
*NL*
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
amazement
.
Bowing
down
to
him
--
what
did
*NL*
it
mean
?
Suddenly
he
cried
aloud
,
``
Oh
,
God
!
''
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
,
*NL*
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
All
the
guests
flocked
out
after
him
,
in
their
*NL*
confusion
not
saying
good-by
,
or
bowing
to
their
host
.
Only
the
monks
went
*NL*
up
to
him
again
for
a
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
it
mean
,
falling
at
his
feet
like
that
?
Was
it
symbolic
or
*NL*
what
?
''
said
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
suddenly
quieted
and
trying
to
reopen
*NL*
conversation
without
venturing
to
address
anybody
in
particular
.
They
were
*NL*
all
passing
out
of
the
precincts
of
the
hermitage
at
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
answer
for
a
madhouse

Miuesov
answered
at
once
*NL*
ill-humoredly
,
``

I
will
spare
myself

is
,
the
monk
who
had
invited
them
to
dine
with
the
*NL*
Superior

did
not
keep
them
waiting
.
He
met
them
as
soon
as
they
came
down
*NL*
the
steps
from
the
elder
's
cell
,
as
though
he
had
been
waiting
for
them

all
the
time

*NL*
*NL*
``

irritably
to
the

*NL*
``
And

Fyodor

cut
in

The

thought
Miuesov
,
still
*NL*
hesitating
,
and
watching
the
retreating
buffoon
with
distrustful
eyes
.
The
*NL*
latter
turned
round
,
and
noticing
that
Miuesov
was
watching
him
,
waved
him
*NL*
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
coming

Miuesov
asked
Ivan
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I
was
especially
invited

*NL*
*NL*
``
Unfortunately

go

*NL*
said
Miuesov
with
the
same
irritability
,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
monk
was
listening
.
``
We
ought
,
at

observed
Ivan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
should
hope

Confound
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
walked
on
,
however
.
The
monk
listened
in
silence
.
On
the
road
*NL*
through
the
copse
he
made
one
observation
however
--
that
the
Father
Superior
*NL*
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
,
and
that
they
were
more
than
half
an
hour
*NL*
late
.
He
received
no
answer
.
Miuesov
looked
with
hatred
at
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
,
going
to
the
dinner

A
Young
Man
Bent
On
A
Career
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
helped
Father
Zossima
to
his
bedroom
and
seated
him
on
his
bed
.
It
*NL*
was
a
little
room
furnished
with
the
bare
necessities
.
There
was
a
narrow
*NL*
iron
bedstead
,
with
a
strip
of
felt
for
a
mattress
.
In
the
corner
,
under
*NL*
the
ikons
,
was
a
reading-desk
with
a
cross
and
the
Gospel
lying
on
it
.
The
*NL*
elder
sank
exhausted
on
the
bed
.
His
eyes
glittered
and
he
breathed
hard
.
*NL*
He
looked
intently
at
Alyosha
,
as
though
considering
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
dear
boy
,
go
.
Porfiry
is
enough
for
me
.
Make
haste
,
you
are
needed
*NL*
there
,
go
and
wait
at
the
Father
Superior
's
table

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
stay
here

Alyosha
entreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
more
needed
there
.
There
is
no
peace
there
.
You
will
wait
,
and
be
*NL*
of
service
.
If
evil
spirits
rise
up
,
repeat
a
prayer
.
And
remember
,
my
*NL*
son
''
--
the
elder
liked
to
call
him
that
--
``
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
in
*NL*
the
future
.
When
it
is
God
's
will
to
call
me
,
leave
the
monastery
.
Go
away
*NL*
for
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
This
is
not
your
place
for
the
time
.
I
bless
you
for
great
*NL*
service
in
the
world
.
Yours
will
be
a
long
pilgrimage
.
And
you
will
have
*NL*
to
take
a
wife
,
too
.
You
will
have
to
bear
_
all
_
before
you
come
back
.
*NL*
There
will
be
much
to
do
.
But
I
do
n't
doubt
of
you
,
and
so
I
send
you
*NL*
forth
.
Christ
is
with
you
.
Do
not
abandon
Him
and
He
will
not
abandon
you

*NL*
You
will
see
great
sorrow
,
and
in
that
sorrow
you
will
be
happy
.
This
is
*NL*
my
last
message
to
you
:
in
sorrow
seek
happiness
.
Work
,
work
unceasingly

*NL*
Remember
my
words
,
for
although
I
shall
talk
with
you
again
,
not
only
my
*NL*
days
but
my
hours
are
numbered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
's
face
again
betrayed
strong
emotion
.
The
corners
of
his
mouth
*NL*
quivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
again
?
''
Father
Zossima
asked
,
smiling
gently
.
``
The
worldly
may
*NL*
follow
the
dead
with
tears
,
but
here
we
rejoice
over
the
father
who
is
*NL*
departing
.
We
rejoice
and
pray
for
him
.
Leave
me
,
I
must
pray
.
Go
,
and
*NL*
make
haste
.
Be
near
your
brothers
.
And
not
near
one
only
,
but
near
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Zossima
raised
his
hand
to
bless
him
.
Alyosha
could
make
no
*NL*
protest
,
though
he
had
a
great
longing
to
remain
.
He
longed
,
moreover
,
to
*NL*
ask
the
significance
of
his
bowing
to
Dmitri
,
the
question
was
on
the
tip
*NL*
of
his
tongue
,
but
he
dared
not
ask
it
.
He
knew
that
the
elder
would
have
*NL*
explained
it
unasked
if
he
had
thought
fit
.
But
evidently
it
was
not
his
*NL*
will
.
That
action
had
made
a
terrible
impression
on
Alyosha
;
he
believed
*NL*
blindly
in
its
mysterious
significance
.
Mysterious
,
and
perhaps
awful
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
hastened
out
of
the
hermitage
precincts
to
reach
the
monastery
in
*NL*
time
to
serve
at
the
Father
Superior
's
dinner
,
he
felt
a
sudden
pang
at
*NL*
his
heart
,
and
stopped
short
.
He
seemed
to
hear
again
Father
Zossima
's
*NL*
words
,
foretelling
his
approaching
end
.
What
he
had
foretold
so
exactly
*NL*
must
infallibly
come
to
pass
.
Alyosha
believed
that
implicitly
.
But
how
*NL*
could
he
be
left
without
him
?
How
could
he
live
without
seeing
and
hearing
*NL*
him
?
Where
should
he
go
?
He
had
told
him
not
to
weep
,
and
to
leave
the
*NL*
monastery
.
Good
God
!
It
was
long
since
Alyosha
had
known
such
anguish
.
He
*NL*
hurried
through
the
copse
that
divided
the
monastery
from
the
hermitage
,
*NL*
and
unable
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
,
he
gazed
at
the
ancient
*NL*
pines
beside
the
path
.
He
had
not
far
to
go
--
about
five
hundred
paces
.
He
*NL*
expected
to
meet
no
one
at
that
hour
,
but
at
the
first
turn
of
the
path
he
*NL*
noticed
Rakitin
.
He
was
waiting
for
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
waiting
for
me
?
''
asked
Alyosha
,
overtaking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
grinned
Rakitin
.
``
You
are
hurrying
to
the
Father
Superior
,
I
know
;
*NL*
he
has
a
banquet
.
There
's
not
been
such
a
banquet
since
the
Superior
*NL*
entertained
the
Bishop
and
General
Pahatov
,
do
you
remember
?
I
sha
n't
be
*NL*
there
,
but
you
go
and
hand
the
sauces
.
Tell
me
one
thing
,
Alexey
,
what
*NL*
does
that
vision
mean
?
That
's
what
I
want
to
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
vision
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
bowing
to
your
brother
,
Dmitri

And
did
n't
he
tap
the
ground
with
*NL*
his
forehead
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
of
Father
Zossima
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
Father
Zossima
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tapped
the
ground

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
an
irreverent
expression
!
Well
,
what
of
it

Anyway
,
what
does
that
*NL*
vision
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
means

Misha

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew

would
n't

There
's
nothing
wonderful
about
it
,
*NL*
of
course
,
only
the
usual
holy
mummery
.
But
there
was
an
object
in
the
*NL*
performance
.
All
the
pious
people
in
the
town
will
talk
about
it
and
*NL*
spread
the
story
through
the
province
,
wondering
what
it
meant
.
To
my
*NL*
thinking
the
old
man
really
has
a
keen
nose
;
he
sniffed
a
crime
.
Your
*NL*
house
stinks
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
crime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rakitin
evidently
had
something
he
was
eager
to
speak
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
in
your
family
,
this
crime
.
Between
your
brothers
and
your
rich
*NL*
old
father
.
So
Father
Zossima
flopped
down
to
be
ready
for
what
may
turn
*NL*
up
.
If
something
happens
later
on
,
it
'll
be
:
`
Ah
,
the
holy
man
foresaw
it
,
*NL*
prophesied
it
!
'
though
it
's
a
poor
sort
of
prophecy
,
flopping
like
that
.
*NL*
`
Ah
,
but
it
was
symbolic
,
'
they
'll
say
,
`
an
allegory
,
'
and
the
devil
knows
*NL*
what
all
!
It
'll
be
remembered
to
his
glory
:
`
He
predicted
the
crime
and
*NL*
marked
the
criminal
!
'
That
's
always
the
way
with
these
crazy
fanatics
;
*NL*
they
cross
themselves
at
the
tavern
and
throw
stones
at
the
temple
.
Like
*NL*
your
elder
,
he
takes
a
stick
to
a
just
man
and
falls
at
the
feet
of
a
*NL*
murderer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
crime

What
murderer
?
What
do
you
mean

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
stopped
dead

Rakitin
stopped
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

As

did
n't

I
'll
bet

before

That
's
interesting

too

by
the
way

Listen

Alyosha

you
always
*NL*

*NL*

Alyosha
in

low

Even
Rakitin
was
taken
aback

``

you
really
?

he
cried

*NL*
*NL*
``

Alyosha
,

These

have
a
line
which
must

be
crossed

If

run
at
your

with
a

But
your

a
drunken

old
sinner
,
who
can
never
draw
the
line

if
they
both
let
themselves
go

*NL*
they
'll
both
come
to
grief

But

Let

honest

That

how
you

kept

You

a
Karamazov

In

sensuality
is
carried
to
a
disease

But
now
,
these
three
*NL*
sensualists
are
watching
one
another
,
with
their
knives
in
their
belts
.
*NL*
The
three
of
them
are
knocking
their
heads
together

you
may
be
the

fourth

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

There
's
something
*NL*
here

my

A

I

You

you

a

*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
finish

It
's
all
clear

It
's
the
same
old
tune

*NL*
brother
.
If
even
you
are
a
sensualist
at
heart
,
what
of
your
brother
,
*NL*
Ivan
?
He
's
a
Karamazov
,
too
.
What
is
at
the
root
of
all
you
Karamazovs
is
*NL*
that
you
're
all
sensual
,
grasping
and
crazy
!
Your
brother
Ivan
writes
*NL*
theological
articles
in
joke
,
for
some
idiotic
,
unknown
motive
of
his
own
,
*NL*
though
he
's
an
atheist
,
and
he
admits
it
's
a
fraud
himself
--
that
's
your
*NL*
brother
Ivan
.
He
's
trying
to
get
Mitya
's
betrothed
for
himself
,
and
I
*NL*
fancy
he
'll
succeed
,
too
.
And
what
's
more
,
it
's
with
Mitya
's
consent
.
For
*NL*
Mitya
will
surrender
his
betrothed
to
him
to
be
rid
of
her
,
and
escape
to
*NL*
Grushenka
.
And
he
's
ready
to
do
that
in
spite
of
all
his
nobility
and
*NL*
disinterestedness
.
Observe
that
.
Those
are
the
most
fatal
people
!
Who
the
*NL*
devil
can
make
you
out
?
He
recognizes
his
vileness
and
goes
on
with
it
!
*NL*
Let
me
tell
you
,
too
,
the
old
man
,
your
father
,
is
standing
in
Mitya
's
way
*NL*
now
.
He
has
suddenly
gone
crazy
over
Grushenka
.
His
mouth
waters
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
her
.
It
's
simply
on
her
account
he
made
that
scene
in
the
cell
*NL*
just
now
,
simply
because
Miuesov
called
her
an
`
abandoned
creature
.
'
He
's
*NL*
worse
than
a
tom-cat
in
love
.
At
first
she
was
only
employed
by
him
in
*NL*
connection
with
his
taverns
and
in
some
other
shady
business
,
but
now
he
*NL*
has
suddenly
realized
all
she
is
and
has
gone
wild
about
her
.
He
keeps
*NL*
pestering
her
with
his
offers
,
not
honorable
ones
,
of
course
.
And
they
'll
*NL*
come
into
collision
,
the
precious
father
and
son
,
on
that
path
!
But
*NL*
Grushenka
favors
neither
of
them
,
she
's
still
playing
with
them
,
and
*NL*
teasing
them
both
,
considering
which
she
can
get
most
out
of
.
For
though
*NL*
she
could
filch
a
lot
of
money
from
the
papa
he
would
n't
marry
her
,
and
*NL*
maybe
he
'll
turn
stingy
in
the
end
,
and
keep
his
purse
shut
.
That
's
where
*NL*
Mitya
's
value
comes
in
;
he
has
no
money
,
but
he
's
ready
to
marry
her
.
Yes
,
*NL*
ready
to
marry
her
!
to
abandon
his
betrothed
,
a
rare
beauty
,
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
who
's
rich
,
and
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
,
and
to
marry
*NL*
Grushenka
,
who
has
been
the
mistress
of
a
dissolute
old
merchant
,
*NL*
Samsonov
,
a
coarse
,
uneducated
,
provincial
mayor
.
Some
murderous
conflict
*NL*
may
well
come
to
pass
from
all
this
,
and
that
's
what
your
brother
Ivan
is
*NL*
waiting
for
.
It
would
suit
him
down
to
the
ground
.
He
'll
carry
off
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
for
whom
he
is
languishing
,
and
pocket
her
dowry
of
*NL*
sixty
thousand
.
That
's
very
alluring
to
start
with
,
for
a
man
of
no
*NL*
consequence
and
a
beggar
.
And
,
take
note
,
he
wo
n't
be
wronging
Mitya
,
but
*NL*
doing
him
the
greatest
service
.
For
I
know
as
a
fact
that
Mitya
only
last
*NL*
week
,
when
he
was
with
some
gypsy
girls
drunk
in
a
tavern
,
cried
out
aloud
*NL*
that
he
was
unworthy
of
his
betrothed
,
Katya
,
but
that
his
brother
Ivan
,
*NL*
he
was
the
man
who
deserved
her
.
And
Katerina
Ivanovna
will
not
in
the
end
*NL*
refuse
such
a
fascinating
man
as
Ivan
.
She
's
hesitating
between
the
two
of
*NL*
them
already
.
And
how
has
that
Ivan
won
you
all
,
so
that
you
all
worship
*NL*
him
?
He
is
laughing
at
you
,
and
enjoying
himself
at
your
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you

How
can

confidently

''
Alyosha
asked

sharply
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

by

at

build

move
my

let
out

Alyosha

unable

he

I

crimson

Where

Alyosha
flushed
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
I
tell
you
again

I
heard
that

You

often
go

you
told

I
*NL*
never
dreamed
that
you

had
such
contempt

Does
she

really
deserve
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
reasons
of
my

for

That
's
not
your
business

as
for
relationship
,
your
brother

even
your

is
more
likely
*NL*
to
make
her
yours
than
mine

Well

here
we
are

You
'd
better
go
to
the
*NL*
kitchen

Hullo
!
what
's
wrong

what
is
it
?
Are
we
late

They

*NL*
finished
dinner
so
soon

Have
the
Karamazovs
been
making
trouble
again

No

they
have

Here
's
your
father

your
brother
Ivan
after
him

*NL*
They
've
broken
out
from

Father
Superior

And
look
,
Father
Isidor

*NL*
shouting
out
something
after
them
from
the
steps

And
your

*NL*
shouting
and
waving
his
arms

I
expect
he
's
swearing

Bah
,
and
there
goes
*NL*
Miuesov
driving
away
in
his
carriage

You
see
,
he
's
going

And
there
's
old
*NL*
Maximov
running
!
--
there
must
have
been
a
row

There
ca
n't
have
been
any

Surely
they

not
been
beating

Or
have
they

been
beaten
?
It

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
reason
for
Rakitin
's
exclamations
.
There
had
been
a
scandalous
,
*NL*
an
unprecedented
scene
.
It
had
all
come
from
the
impulse
of
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
VIII
.
The
Scandalous
Scene
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Miuesov
,
as
a
man
of
breeding
and
delicacy
,
could
not
but
feel
some
inward
*NL*
qualms
,
when
he
reached
the
Father
Superior
's
with
Ivan
:
he
felt
ashamed
*NL*
of
having
lost
his
temper
.
He
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
disdained
that
*NL*
despicable
wretch
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
too
much
to
have
been
upset
by
him
*NL*
in
Father
Zossima
's
cell
,
and
so
to
have
forgotten
himself
.
``
The
monks
*NL*
were
not
to
blame
,
in
any
case
,
''
he
reflected
,
on
the
steps
.
``
And
if
*NL*
they
're
decent
people
here
-LRB-
and
the
Father
Superior
,
I
understand
,
is
a
*NL*
nobleman
-RRB-
why
not
be
friendly
and
courteous
with
them
?
I
wo
n't
argue
,
I
'll
*NL*
fall
in
with
everything
,
I
'll
win
them
by
politeness
,
and
...
and
...
show
*NL*
them
that
I
've
nothing
to
do
with
that
AEsop
,
that
buffoon
,
that
Pierrot
,
*NL*
and
have
merely
been
taken
in
over
this
affair
,
just
as
they
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
determined
to
drop
his
litigation
with
the
monastery
,
and
relinquish
*NL*
his
claims
to
the
wood-cutting
and
fishery
rights
at
once
.
He
was
the
more
*NL*
ready
to
do
this
because
the
rights
had
become
much
less
valuable
,
and
he
*NL*
had
indeed
the
vaguest
idea
where
the
wood
and
river
in
question
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
excellent
intentions
were
strengthened
when
he
entered
the
Father
*NL*
Superior
's
dining-room
,
though
,
strictly
speaking
,
it
was
not
a
dining
-
*NL*
room
,
for
the
Father
Superior
had
only
two
rooms
altogether
;
they
were
,
*NL*
however
,
much
larger
and
more
comfortable
than
Father
Zossima
's
.
But
there
*NL*
was
no
great
luxury
about
the
furnishing
of
these
rooms
either
.
The
*NL*
furniture
was
of
mahogany
,
covered
with
leather
,
in
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
style
of
1820
;
the
floor
was
not
even
stained
,
but
everything
was
shining
*NL*
with
cleanliness
,
and
there
were
many
choice
flowers
in
the
windows
;
the
*NL*
most
sumptuous
thing
in
the
room
at
the
moment
was
,
of
course
,
the
*NL*
beautifully
decorated
table
.
The
cloth
was
clean
,
the
service
shone
;
there
*NL*
were
three
kinds
of
well-baked
bread
,
two
bottles
of
wine
,
two
of
*NL*
excellent
mead
,
and
a
large
glass
jug
of
kvas
--
both
the
latter
made
in
the
*NL*
monastery
,
and
famous
in
the
neighborhood
.
There
was
no
vodka
.
Rakitin
*NL*
related
afterwards
that
there
were
five
dishes
:
fish-soup
made
of
*NL*
sterlets
,
served
with
little
fish
patties
;
then
boiled
fish
served
in
a
*NL*
special
way
;
then
salmon
cutlets
,
ice
pudding
and
compote
,
and
finally
,
*NL*
blanc-mange
.
Rakitin
found
out
about
all
these
good
things
,
for
he
could
*NL*
not
resist
peeping
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
already
had
a
footing
.
He
*NL*
had
a
footing
everywhere
,
and
got
information
about
everything
.
He
was
of
*NL*
an
uneasy
and
envious
temper
.
He
was
well
aware
of
his
own
considerable
*NL*
abilities
,
and
nervously
exaggerated
them
in
his
self-conceit
.
He
knew
he
*NL*
would
play
a
prominent
part
of
some
sort
,
but
Alyosha
,
who
was
attached
to
*NL*
him
,
was
distressed
to
see
that
his
friend
Rakitin
was
dishonorable
,
and
*NL*
quite
unconscious
of
being
so
himself
,
considering
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
*NL*
because
he
would
not
steal
money
left
on
the
table
he
was
a
man
of
the
*NL*
highest
integrity
.
Neither
Alyosha
nor
any
one
else
could
have
influenced
*NL*
him
in
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rakitin
,
of
course
,
was
a
person
of
too
little
consequence
to
be
invited
*NL*
to
the
dinner
,
to
which
Father
Iosif
,
Father
Paissy
,
and
one
other
monk
*NL*
were
the
only
inmates
of
the
monastery
invited
.
They
were
already
waiting
*NL*
when
Miuesov
,
Kalganov
,
and
Ivan
arrived
.
The
other
guest
,
Maximov
,
stood
a
*NL*
little
aside
,
waiting
also
.
The
Father
Superior
stepped
into
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
room
to
receive
his
guests
.
He
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
but
still
vigorous
*NL*
old
man
,
with
black
hair
streaked
with
gray
,
and
a
long
,
grave
,
ascetic
*NL*
face
.
He
bowed
to
his
guests
in
silence
.
But
this
time
they
approached
to
*NL*
receive
his
blessing
.
Miuesov
even
tried
to
kiss
his
hand
,
but
the
Father
*NL*
Superior
drew
it
back
in
time
to
avoid
the
salute
.
But
Ivan
and
Kalganov
*NL*
went
through
the
ceremony
in
the
most
simple-hearted
and
complete
manner
,
*NL*
kissing
his
hand
as
peasants
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
apologize
most
humbly
,
your
reverence
,
''
began
Miuesov
,
simpering
*NL*
affably
,
and
speaking
in
a
dignified
and
respectful
tone
.
``
Pardon
us
for
*NL*
having
come
alone
without
the
gentleman
you
invited
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
He
*NL*
felt
obliged
to
decline
the
honor
of
your
hospitality
,
and
not
without
*NL*
reason
.
In
the
reverend
Father
Zossima
's
cell
he
was
carried
away
by
the
*NL*
unhappy
dissension
with
his
son
,
and
let
fall
words
which
were
quite
out
*NL*
of
keeping
...
in
fact
,
quite
unseemly
...
as
''
--
he
glanced
at
the
*NL*
monks
--
``
your
reverence
is
,
no
doubt
,
already
aware
.
And
therefore
,
*NL*
recognizing
that
he
had
been
to
blame
,
he
felt
sincere
regret
and
shame
,
*NL*
and
begged
me
,
and
his
son
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
to
convey
to
you
his
*NL*
apologies
and
regrets
.
In
brief
,
he
hopes
and
desires
to
make
amends
*NL*
later
.
He
asks
your
blessing
,
and
begs
you
to
forget
what
has
taken
*NL*
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
uttered
the
last
word
of
his
tirade
,
Miuesov
completely
recovered
his
*NL*
self-complacency
,
and
all
traces
of
his
former
irritation
disappeared
.
He
*NL*
fully
and
sincerely
loved
humanity
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Father
Superior
listened
to
him
with
dignity
,
and
,
with
a
slight
bend
*NL*
of
the
head
,
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sincerely
deplore
his
absence
.
Perhaps
at
our
table
he
might
have
*NL*
learnt
to
like
us
,
and
we
him
.
Pray
be
seated
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
before
the
holy
image
,
and
began
to
say
grace
,
aloud
.
All
bent
*NL*
their
heads
reverently
,
and
Maximov
clasped
his
hands
before
him
,
with
*NL*
peculiar
fervor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
moment
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
played
his
last
prank
.
It
*NL*
must
be
noted
that
he
really
had
meant
to
go
home
,
and
really
had
felt
the
*NL*
impossibility
of
going
to
dine
with
the
Father
Superior
as
though
nothing
*NL*
had
happened
,
after
his
disgraceful
behavior
in
the
elder
's
cell
.
Not
that
*NL*
he
was
so
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
--
quite
the
contrary
perhaps
.
But
*NL*
still
he
felt
it
would
be
unseemly
to
go
to
dinner
.
Yet
his
creaking
*NL*
carriage
had
hardly
been
brought
to
the
steps
of
the
hotel
,
and
he
had
*NL*
hardly
got
into
it
,
when
he
suddenly
stopped
short
.
He
remembered
his
own
*NL*
words
at
the
elder
's
:
``
I
always
feel
when
I
meet
people
that
I
am
lower
*NL*
than
all
,
and
that
they
all
take
me
for
a
buffoon
;
so
I
say
let
me
play
*NL*
the
buffoon
,
for
you
are
,
every
one
of
you
,
stupider
and
lower
than
I.
''
He
*NL*
longed
to
revenge
himself
on
every
one
for
his
own
unseemliness
.
He
*NL*
suddenly
recalled
how
he
had
once
in
the
past
been
asked
,
``
Why
do
you
hate
*NL*
so
and
so
,
so
much
?
''
And
he
had
answered
them
,
with
his
shameless
*NL*
impudence
,
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
He
has
done
me
no
harm
.
But
I
played
him
a
*NL*
dirty
trick
,
and
ever
since
I
have
hated
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Remembering
that
now
,
he
smiled
quietly
and
malignantly
,
hesitating
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
His
eyes
gleamed
,
and
his
lips
positively
quivered
.
``
Well
,
since
I
*NL*
have
begun
,
I
may
as
well
go
on
,
''
he
decided
.
His
predominant
sensation
at
*NL*
that
moment
might
be
expressed
in
the
following
words
,
``
Well
,
there
is
no
*NL*
rehabilitating
myself
now
.
So
let
me
shame
them
for
all
I
am
worth
.
I
will
*NL*
show
them
I
do
n't
care
what
they
think
--
that
's
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
the
coachman
to
wait
,
while
with
rapid
steps
he
returned
to
the
*NL*
monastery
and
straight
to
the
Father
Superior
's
.
He
had
no
clear
idea
what
*NL*
he
would
do
,
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
control
himself
,
and
that
a
*NL*
touch
might
drive
him
to
the
utmost
limits
of
obscenity
,
but
only
to
*NL*
obscenity
,
to
nothing
criminal
,
nothing
for
which
he
could
be
legally
*NL*
punished
.
In
the
last
resort
,
he
could
always
restrain
himself
,
and
had
*NL*
marveled
indeed
at
himself
,
on
that
score
,
sometimes
.
He
appeared
in
the
*NL*
Father
Superior
's
dining-room
,
at
the
moment
when
the
prayer
was
over
,
and
*NL*
all
were
moving
to
the
table
.
Standing
in
the
doorway
,
he
scanned
the
*NL*
company
,
and
laughing
his
prolonged
,
impudent
,
malicious
chuckle
,
looked
*NL*
them
all
boldly
in
the

``
They
thought
I
had
gone
,
and
here
I
am
*NL*
again
,
''
he
cried
to
the
whole
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
one
moment
every
one
stared
at
him
without
a
word
;
and
at
once
every
*NL*
one
felt
that
something
revolting
,
grotesque
,
positively
scandalous
,
was
*NL*
about
to
happen
.
Miuesov
passed
immediately
from
the
most
benevolent
frame
*NL*
of
mind
to
the
most
savage
.
All
the
feelings
that
had
subsided
and
died
*NL*
down
in
his
heart
revived
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
this
I
can
not
endure
!
''
he
cried
.
``
I
absolutely
can
not
!
and
...
I
*NL*
certainly
can
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
his
head
.
He
positively
stammered
;
but
he
was
beyond
*NL*
thinking
of
style
,
and
he
seized
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
he
can
not
?
''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
``
that
he
absolutely
*NL*
can
not
and
certainly
can
not
?
Your
reverence
,
am
I
to
come
in
or
not
?
Will
*NL*
you
receive
me
as
your
guest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
welcome
with
all
my
heart
,
''
answered
the
Superior
.
``
Gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
he
added
,
``
I
venture
to
beg
you
most
earnestly
to
lay
aside
your
*NL*
dissensions
,
and
to
be
united
in
love
and
family
harmony
--
with
prayer
to
*NL*
the
Lord
at
our
humble
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
is
impossible
!
''
cried
Miuesov
,
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
it
is
impossible
for
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
,
it
is
impossible
for
*NL*
me
,
and
I
wo
n't
stop
.
That
is
why
I
came
.
I
will
keep
with
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
everywhere
now
.
If
you
will
go
away
,
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
I
will
go
away
too
,
if
you
remain
,
I
will
remain
.
You
stung
him
by
what
*NL*
you
said
about
family
harmony
,
Father
Superior
,
he
does
not
admit
he
is
my
*NL*
relation
.
That
's
right
,
is
n't
it
,
von
Sohn
?
Here
's
von
Sohn
.
How
are
you
,
*NL*
von
Sohn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
me
?
''
muttered
Maximov
,
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
mean
you
,
''
cried
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
``
Who
else
?
The
Father
*NL*
Superior
could
not
be
von
Sohn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
von
Sohn
either
.
I
am
Maximov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
are
von
Sohn
.
Your
reverence
,
do
you
know
who
von
Sohn
was
?
It
*NL*
was
a
famous
murder
case
.
He
was
killed
in
a
house
of
harlotry
--
I
believe
*NL*
that
is
what
such
places
are
called
among
you
--
he
was
killed
and
robbed
,
*NL*
and
in
spite
of
his
venerable
age
,
he
was
nailed
up
in
a
box
and
sent
from
*NL*
Petersburg
to
Moscow
in
the
luggage
van
,
and
while
they
were
nailing
him
*NL*
up
,
the
harlots
sang
songs
and
played
the
harp
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
piano
.
*NL*
So
this
is
that
very
von
Sohn
.
He
has
risen
from
the
dead
,
has
n't
he
,
von
*NL*
Sohn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
happening
?
What
's
this
?
''
voices
were
heard
in
the
group
of
monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
''
cried
Miuesov
,
addressing
Kalganov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
excuse
me
,
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
broke
in
shrilly
,
taking
another
step
*NL*
into
the
room
.
``
Allow
me
to
finish
.
There
in
the
cell
you
blamed
me
for
*NL*
behaving
disrespectfully
just
because
I
spoke
of
eating
gudgeon
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
Miuesov
,
my
relation
,
prefers
to
have
_
plus
de
noblesse
que
*NL*
de
sincerite
_
in
his
words
,
but
I
prefer
in
mine
_
plus
de
sincerite
que
de
*NL*
noblesse
_
,
and
--
damn
the
_
noblesse
_
!
That
's
right
,
is
n't
it
,
von
Sohn
?
*NL*
Allow
me
,
Father
Superior
,
though
I
am
a
buffoon
and
play
the
buffoon
,
yet
*NL*
I
am
the
soul
of
honor
,
and
I
want
to
speak
my
mind
.
Yes
,
I
am
the
soul
of
*NL*
honor
,
while
in
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
there
is
wounded
vanity
and
nothing
*NL*
else
.
I
came
here
perhaps
to
have
a
look
and
speak
my
mind
.
My
son
,
*NL*
Alexey
,
is
here
,
being
saved
.
I
am
his
father
;
I
care
for
his
welfare
,
and
*NL*
it
is
my
duty
to
care
.
While
I
've
been
playing
the
fool
,
I
have
been
*NL*
listening
and
having
a
look
on
the
sly
;
and
now
I
want
to
give
you
the
*NL*
last
act
of
the
performance
.
You
know
how
things
are
with
us
?
As
a
thing
*NL*
falls
,
so
it
lies
.
As
a
thing
once
has
fallen
,
so
it
must
lie
for
ever
.
*NL*
Not
a
bit
of
it
!
I
want
to
get
up
again
.
Holy
Father
,
I
am
indignant
with
*NL*
you
.
Confession
is
a
great
sacrament
,
before
which
I
am
ready
to
bow
down
*NL*
reverently
;
but
there
in
the
cell
,
they
all
kneel
down
and
confess
aloud
.
*NL*
Can
it
be
right
to
confess
aloud
?
It
was
ordained
by
the
holy
Fathers
to
*NL*
confess
in
secret
:
then
only
your
confession
will
be
a
mystery
,
and
so
it
*NL*
was
of
old
.
But
how
can
I
explain
to
him
before
every
one
that
I
did
this
*NL*
and
that
...
well
,
you
understand
what
--
sometimes
it
would
not
be
proper
to
*NL*
talk
about
it
--
so
it
is
really
a
scandal
!
No
,
Fathers
,
one
might
be
carried
*NL*
along
with
you
to
the
Flagellants
,
I
dare
say
...
at
the
first
opportunity
*NL*
I
shall
write
to
the
Synod
,
and
I
shall
take
my
son
,
Alexey
,
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
note
here
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
knew
where
to
look
for
the
weak
*NL*
spot
.
There
had
been
at
one
time
malicious
rumors
which
had
even
reached
*NL*
the
Archbishop
-LRB-
not
only
regarding
our
monastery
,
but
in
others
where
the
*NL*
institution
of
elders
existed
-RRB-
that
too
much
respect
was
paid
to
the
*NL*
elders
,
even
to
the
detriment
of
the
authority
of
the
Superior
,
that
the
*NL*
elders
abused
the
sacrament
of
confession
and
so
on
and
so
on
--
absurd
*NL*
charges
which
had
died
away
of
themselves
everywhere
.
But
the
spirit
of
*NL*
folly
,
which
had
caught
up
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
and
was
bearing
him
on
the
*NL*
current
of
his
own
nerves
into
lower
and
lower
depths
of
ignominy
,
*NL*
prompted
him
with
this
old
slander
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
did
not
understand
a
*NL*
word
of
it
,
and
he
could
not
even
put
it
sensibly
,
for
on
this
occasion
no
*NL*
one
had
been
kneeling
and
confessing
aloud
in
the
elder
's
cell
,
so
that
he
*NL*
could
not
have
seen
anything
of
the
kind
.
He
was
only
speaking
from
*NL*
confused
memory
of
old
slanders
.
But
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
his
foolish
*NL*
tirade
,
he
felt
he
had
been
talking
absurd
nonsense
,
and
at
once
longed
to
*NL*
prove
to
his
audience
,
and
above
all
to
himself
,
that
he
had
not
been
*NL*
talking
nonsense
.
And
,
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
with
each
word
*NL*
he
would
be
adding
more
and
more
absurdity
,
he
could
not
restrain
himself
,
*NL*
and
plunged
forward
blindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
disgraceful
!
''
cried
Pyotr
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
!
''
said
the
Father
Superior
.
``
It
was
said
of
old
,
`
Many
have
*NL*
begun
to
speak
against
me
and
have
uttered
evil
sayings
about
me
.
And
*NL*
hearing
it
I
have
said
to
myself
:
it
is
the
correction
of
the
Lord
and
He
*NL*
has
sent
it
to
heal
my
vain
soul
.
'
And
so
we
humbly
thank
you

honored

he
made
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
a
low
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

aloud

why
do

you

Why

Why

that
I
will
come

fast

without
expecting

up

you
'll
find

a

harder

He
went
up

wringing

Father

kept
obstinately

Miuesov
rushed
from

Kalganov
after
him

*NL*
*NL*
``

He
thumped
the
table
with
his
fist
in
a
paroxysm
*NL*
of
simulated
feeling
.
``
This

has
played

It
must
be
noted
again
that

never
had
played
any

he
never

shed
a

he
was

so
carried
away

*NL*
almost
believing

He
was

was
almost
weeping

at

he
felt

back

The

bowed
his

saw

got
into

was
about

grim
silence

even
turning

But
at
this
point
another
almost
incredible
scene
of
grotesque
*NL*
buffoonery
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
the
episode

Maximov
suddenly
*NL*
appeared
by

side

He
ran
up

panting

afraid
of
being
*NL*
too
late

Rakitin

Alyosha
saw
him
running

He
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
*NL*
in
his
impatience
he
put
his
foot
on
the
step
on
which
Ivan

left
foot
*NL*
was
still
resting

clutching
the
carriage
he
kept
trying
to
jump
in

*NL*
``

he
kept
shouting

laughing
a
thin
mirthful

reckless
glee
in

face

``

*NL*
*NL*
But
Ivan
,
who
had
by
now
taken
his
seat
,
without
a
word
gave
Maximov
a
*NL*
violent
punch
in
the
breast
and
sent
him
flying
.
It
was
quite
by
chance
he
*NL*
did
not
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive
on

''
Ivan
shouted
angrily
to
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
are
you
doing

what
are
you
about

Why
did
you
do
that

''
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
carriage
had
already
driven
away
.
Ivan
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
a
fellow
,
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
of
two
minutes
,
looking
askance
at
his
son
,
``
Why
,
it
was
you
*NL*
got
up
all
this
monastery
business

You
urged
it

you
approved

Why
*NL*
are
you
angry
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
talked
rot
enough
.
You
might
rest
a
bit
now

''
Ivan
snapped
*NL*
sullenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
silent
again
for
two
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
drop
of
brandy
would
be
nice
now
,
''
he
observed
sententiously
,
but
Ivan
*NL*
made
no
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
some
,
too
,
when
we
get
home

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
was
still
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
waited
another
two
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
,
and
turning
away
stared
at
the

road

And
they
did
not

again
all
the

The
Sensualists
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I
.
In
The
Servants
'
Quarters
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Karamazovs
'
house
was
far
from
being
in
the
center
of
the
town
,
but
it
*NL*
was
not
quite
outside
it
.
It
was
a
pleasant-looking
old
house
of
two
*NL*
stories
,
painted
gray
,
with
a
red
iron
roof
.
It
was
roomy
and
snug
,
and
*NL*
might
still
last
many
years
.
There
were
all
sorts
of
unexpected
little
*NL*
cupboards
and
closets
and
staircases
.
There
were
rats
in
it
,
but
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
did
not
altogether
dislike
them
.
``
One
does
n't
feel
so
solitary
*NL*
when
one
's
left
alone
in
the
evening
,
''
he
used
to
say
.
It
was
his
habit
to
*NL*
send
the
servants
away
to
the
lodge
for
the
night
and
to
lock
himself
up
*NL*
alone
.
The
lodge
was
a
roomy
and
solid
building
in
the
yard
.
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
used
to
have
the
cooking
done
there
,
although
there
was
a
*NL*
kitchen
in
the
house
;
he
did
not
like
the
smell
of
cooking
,
and
,
winter
*NL*
and
summer
alike
,
the
dishes
were
carried
in
across
the
courtyard
.
The
*NL*
house
was
built
for
a
large
family
;
there
was
room
for
five
times
as
many
,
*NL*
with
their
servants
.
But
at
the
time
of
our
story
there
was
no
one
living
*NL*
in
the
house
but
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
his
son
Ivan
.
And
in
the
lodge
*NL*
there
were
only
three
servants
:
old
Grigory
,
and
his
old
wife
Marfa
,
and
a
*NL*
young
man
called
Smerdyakov
.
Of
these
three
we
must
say
a
few
words
.
Of
*NL*
old
Grigory
we
have
said
something
already
.
He
was
firm
and
determined
and
*NL*
went
blindly
and
obstinately
for
his
object
,
if
once
he
had
been
brought
*NL*
by
any
reasons
-LRB-
and
they
were
often
very
illogical
ones
-RRB-
to
believe
that
*NL*
it
was
immutably
right
.
He
was
honest
and
incorruptible
.
His
wife
,
Marfa
*NL*
Ignatyevna
,
had
obeyed
her
husband
's
will
implicitly
all
her
life
,
yet
she
*NL*
had
pestered
him
terribly
after
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
.
She
was
set
*NL*
on
leaving
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
opening
a
little
shop
in
Moscow
with
*NL*
their
small
savings
.
But
Grigory
decided
then
,
once
for
all
,
that
``
the
*NL*
woman
's
talking
nonsense
,
for
every
woman
is
dishonest
,
''
and
that
they
*NL*
ought
not
to
leave
their
old
master
,
whatever
he
might
be
,
for
``
that
was
*NL*
now
their
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
what
duty
is
?
''
he
asked
Marfa
Ignatyevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
what
duty
means
,
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
,
but
why
it
's
our
*NL*
duty
to
stay
here
I
never
shall
understand
,
''
Marfa
answered
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
understand
then
.
But
so
it
shall
be
.
And
you
hold
your
*NL*
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
.
They
did
not
go
away
,
and
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
promised
them
a
*NL*
small
sum
for
wages
,
and
paid
it
regularly
.
Grigory
knew
,
too
,
that
he
had
*NL*
an
indisputable
influence
over
his
master
.
It
was
true
,
and
he
was
aware
*NL*
of
it
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
an
obstinate
and
cunning
buffoon
,
yet
,
though
*NL*
his
will
was
strong
enough
``
in
some
of
the
affairs
of
life
,
''
as
he
*NL*
expressed
it
,
he
found
himself
,
to
his
surprise
,
extremely
feeble
in
*NL*
facing
certain
other
emergencies
.
He
knew
his
weaknesses
and
was
afraid
of
*NL*
them
.
There
are
positions
in
which
one
has
to
keep
a
sharp
look
out
.
And
*NL*
that
's
not
easy
without
a
trustworthy
man
,
and
Grigory
was
a
most
*NL*
trustworthy
man
.
Many
times
in
the
course
of
his
life
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
had
only
just
escaped
a
sound
thrashing
through
Grigory
's
intervention
,
*NL*
and
on
each
occasion
the
old
servant
gave
him
a
good
lecture
.
But
it
*NL*
was
n't
only
thrashings
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
afraid
of
.
There
were
*NL*
graver
occasions
,
and
very
subtle
and
complicated
ones
,
when
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
could
not
have
explained
the
extraordinary
craving
for
some
one
*NL*
faithful
and
devoted
,
which
sometimes
unaccountably
came
upon
him
all
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
It
was
almost
a
morbid
condition
.
Corrupt
and
often
cruel
in
his
*NL*
lust
,
like
some
noxious
insect
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
sometimes
,
in
*NL*
moments
of
drunkenness
,
overcome
by
superstitious
terror
and
a
moral
*NL*
convulsion
which
took
an
almost
physical
form
.
``
My
soul
's
simply
quaking
*NL*
in
my
throat
at
those
times
,
''
he
used
to
say
.
At
such
moments
he
liked
to
*NL*
feel
that
there
was
near
at
hand
,
in
the
lodge
if
not
in
the
room
,
a
*NL*
strong
,
faithful
man
,
virtuous
and
unlike
himself
,
who
had
seen
all
his
*NL*
debauchery
and
knew
all
his
secrets
,
but
was
ready
in
his
devotion
to
*NL*
overlook
all
that
,
not
to
oppose
him
,
above
all
,
not
to
reproach
him
or
*NL*
threaten
him
with
anything
,
either
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
,
and
,
in
*NL*
case
of
need
,
to
defend
him
--
from
whom
?
From
somebody
unknown
,
but
terrible
*NL*
and
dangerous
.
What
he
needed
was
to
feel
that
there
was
_
another
_
man
,
an
*NL*
old
and
tried
friend
,
that
he
might
call
him
in
his
sick
moments
merely
to
*NL*
look
at
his
face
,
or
,
perhaps
,
exchange
some
quite
irrelevant
words
with
*NL*
him
.
And
if
the
old
servant
were
not
angry
,
he
felt
comforted
,
and
if
he
*NL*
were
angry
,
he
was
more
dejected
.
It
happened
even
-LRB-
very
rarely
however
-RRB-
*NL*
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
went
at
night
to
the
lodge
to
wake
Grigory
and
*NL*
fetch
him
for
a
moment
.
When
the
old
man
came
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
would
*NL*
begin
talking
about
the
most
trivial
matters
,
and
would
soon
let
him
go
*NL*
again
,
sometimes
even
with
a
jest
.
And
after
he
had
gone
,
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
would
get
into
bed
with
a
curse
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
*NL*
just
.
Something
of
the
same
sort
had
happened
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
on
*NL*
Alyosha
's
arrival
.
Alyosha
``
pierced
his
heart
''
by
``
living
with
him
,
seeing
*NL*
everything
and
blaming
nothing
.
''
Moreover
,
Alyosha
brought
with
him
*NL*
something
his
father
had
never
known
before
:
a
complete
absence
of
*NL*
contempt
for
him
and
an
invariable
kindness
,
a
perfectly
natural
*NL*
unaffected
devotion
to
the
old
man
who
deserved
it
so
little
.
All
this
was
*NL*
a
complete
surprise
to
the
old
profligate
,
who
had
dropped
all
family
*NL*
ties
.
It
was
a
new
and
surprising
experience
for
him
,
who
had
till
then
*NL*
loved
nothing
but
``
evil
.
''
When
Alyosha
had
left
him
,
he
confessed
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
had
learnt
something
he
had
not
till
then
been
willing
to
*NL*
learn
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
already
that
Grigory
had
detested
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
the
*NL*
first
wife
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
the
mother
of
Dmitri
,
and
that
he
had
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
protected
Sofya
Ivanovna
,
the
poor
``
crazy
woman
,
''
against
*NL*
his
master
and
any
one
who
chanced
to
speak
ill
or
lightly
of
her
.
His
*NL*
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
wife
had
become
something
sacred
to
him
,
so
that
*NL*
even
now
,
twenty
years
after
,
he
could
not
bear
a
slighting
allusion
to
*NL*
her
from
any
one
,
and
would
at
once
check
the
offender
.
Externally
,
*NL*
Grigory
was
cold
,
dignified
and
taciturn
,
and
spoke
,
weighing
his
words
,
*NL*
without
frivolity
.
It
was
impossible
to
tell
at
first
sight
whether
he
*NL*
loved
his
meek
,
obedient
wife
;
but
he
really
did
love
her
,
and
she
knew
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marfa
Ignatyevna
was
by
no
means
foolish
;
she
was
probably
,
indeed
,
*NL*
cleverer
than
her
husband
,
or
,
at
least
,
more
prudent
than
he
in
worldly
*NL*
affairs
,
and
yet
she
had
given
in
to
him
in
everything
without
question
or
*NL*
complaint
ever
since
her
marriage
,
and
respected
him
for
his
spiritual
*NL*
superiority
.
It
was
remarkable
how
little
they
spoke
to
one
another
in
the
*NL*
course
of
their
lives
,
and
only
of
the
most
necessary
daily
affairs
.
The
*NL*
grave
and
dignified
Grigory
thought
over
all
his
cares
and
duties
alone
,
*NL*
so
that
Marfa
Ignatyevna
had
long
grown
used
to
knowing
that
he
did
not
*NL*
need
her
advice
.
She
felt
that
her
husband
respected
her
silence
,
and
took
*NL*
it
as
a
sign
of
her
good
sense
.
He
had
never
beaten
her
but
once
,
and
then
*NL*
only
slightly
.
Once
during
the
year
after
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
marriage
*NL*
with
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
the
village
girls
and
women
--
at
that
time
*NL*
serfs
--
were
called
together
before
the
house
to
sing
and
dance
.
They
were
*NL*
beginning
``
In
the
Green
Meadows
,
''
when
Marfa
,
at
that
time
a
young
woman
,
*NL*
skipped
forward
and
danced
``
the
Russian
Dance
,
''
not
in
the
village
*NL*
fashion
,
but
as
she
had
danced
it
when
she
was
a
servant
in
the
service
of
*NL*
the
rich
Miuesov
family
,
in
their
private
theater
,
where
the
actors
were
*NL*
taught
to
dance
by
a
dancing
master
from
Moscow
.
Grigory
saw
how
his
wife
*NL*
danced
,
and
,
an
hour
later
,
at
home
in
their
cottage
he
gave
her
a
lesson
,
*NL*
pulling
her
hair
a
little
.
But
there
it
ended
:
the
beating
was
never
*NL*
repeated
,
and
Marfa
Ignatyevna
gave
up
dancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
had
not
blessed
them
with
children
.
One
child
was
born
but
it
died
.
*NL*
Grigory
was
fond
of
children
,
and
was
not
ashamed
of
showing
it
.
When
*NL*
Adelaida
Ivanovna
had
run
away
,
Grigory
took
Dmitri
,
then
a
child
of
three
*NL*
years
old
,
combed
his
hair
and
washed
him
in
a
tub
with
his
own
hands
,
and
*NL*
looked
after
him
for
almost
a
year
.
Afterwards
he
had
looked
after
Ivan
*NL*
and
Alyosha
,
for
which
the
general
's
widow
had
rewarded
him
with
a
slap
in
*NL*
the
face
;
but
I
have
already
related
all
that
.
The
only
happiness
his
own
*NL*
child
had
brought
him
had
been
in
the
anticipation
of
its
birth
.
When
it
*NL*
was
born
,
he
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
horror
.
The
baby
had
six
*NL*
fingers
.
Grigory
was
so
crushed
by
this
,
that
he
was
not
only
silent
till
*NL*
the
day
of
the
christening
,
but
kept
away
in
the
garden
.
It
was
spring
,
*NL*
and
he
spent
three
days
digging
the
kitchen
garden
.
The
third
day
was
*NL*
fixed
for
christening
the
baby
:
mean-time
Grigory
had
reached
a
*NL*
conclusion
.
Going
into
the
cottage
where
the
clergy
were
assembled
and
the
*NL*
visitors
had
arrived
,
including
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
was
to
stand
god
-
*NL*
father
,
he
suddenly
announced
that
the
baby
``
ought
not
to
be
christened
at
*NL*
all
.
''
He
announced
this
quietly
,
briefly
,
forcing
out
his
words
,
and
*NL*
gazing
with
dull
intentness
at
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
the
priest
with
good-humored
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
a
dragon
,
''
muttered
Grigory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dragon
?
What
dragon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
did
not
speak
for
some
time
.
``
It
's
a
confusion
of
nature
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
vaguely
,
but
firmly
,
and
obviously
unwilling
to
say
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
laughed
,
and
of
course
christened
the
poor
baby
.
Grigory
prayed
*NL*
earnestly
at
the
font
,
but
his
opinion
of
the
new-born
child
remained
*NL*
unchanged
.
Yet
he
did
not
interfere
in
any
way
.
As
long
as
the
sickly
*NL*
infant
lived
he
scarcely
looked
at
it
,
tried
indeed
not
to
notice
it
,
and
*NL*
for
the
most
part
kept
out
of
the
cottage
.
But
when
,
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
fortnight
,
the
baby
died
of
thrush
,
he
himself
laid
the
child
in
its
*NL*
little
coffin
,
looked
at
it
in
profound
grief
,
and
when
they
were
filling
*NL*
up
the
shallow
little
grave
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
bowed
down
to
the
*NL*
earth
.
He
did
not
for
years
afterwards
mention
his
child
,
nor
did
Marfa
*NL*
speak
of
the
baby
before
him
,
and
,
even
if
Grigory
were
not
present
,
she
*NL*
never
spoke
of
it
above
a
whisper
.
Marfa
observed
that
,
from
the
day
of
*NL*
the
burial
,
he
devoted
himself
to
``
religion
,
''
and
took
to
reading
the
*NL*
_
Lives
of
the
Saints
_
,
for
the
most
part
sitting
alone
and
in
silence
,
and
*NL*
always
putting
on
his
big
,
round
,
silver-rimmed
spectacles
.
He
rarely
read
*NL*
aloud
,
only
perhaps
in
Lent
.
He
was
fond
of
the
Book
of
Job
,
and
had
*NL*
somehow
got
hold
of
a
copy
of
the
sayings
and
sermons
of
``
the
God-fearing
*NL*
Father
Isaac
the
Syrian
,
''
which
he
read
persistently
for
years
together
,
*NL*
understanding
very
little
of
it
,
but
perhaps
prizing
and
loving
it
the
*NL*
more
for
that
.
Of
late
he
had
begun
to
listen
to
the
doctrines
of
the
sect
*NL*
of
Flagellants
settled
in
the
neighborhood
.
He
was
evidently
shaken
by
*NL*
them
,
but
judged
it
unfitting
to
go
over
to
the
new
faith
.
His
habit
of
*NL*
theological
reading
gave
him
an
expression
of
still
greater
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
perhaps
predisposed
to
mysticism
.
And
the
birth
of
his
deformed
*NL*
child
,
and
its
death
,
had
,
as
though
by
special
design
,
been
accompanied
*NL*
by
another
strange
and
marvelous
event
,
which
,
as
he
said
later
,
had
left
*NL*
a
``
stamp
''
upon
his
soul
.
It
happened
that
,
on
the
very
night
after
the
*NL*
burial
of
his
child
,
Marfa
was
awakened
by
the
wail
of
a
new-born
baby
.
*NL*
She
was
frightened
and
waked
her
husband
.
He
listened
and
said
he
thought
*NL*
it
was
more
like
some
one
groaning
,
``
it
might
be
a
woman
.
''
He
got
up
and
*NL*
dressed
.
It
was
a
rather
warm
night
in
May
.
As
he
went
down
the
steps
,
he
*NL*
distinctly
heard
groans
coming
from
the
garden
.
But
the
gate
from
the
yard
*NL*
into
the
garden
was
locked
at
night
,
and
there
was
no
other
way
of
*NL*
entering
it
,
for
it
was
enclosed
all
round
by
a
strong
,
high
fence
.
Going
*NL*
back
into
the
house
,
Grigory
lighted
a
lantern
,
took
the
garden
key
,
and
*NL*
taking
no
notice
of
the
hysterical
fears
of
his
wife
,
who
was
still
*NL*
persuaded
that
she
heard
a
child
crying
,
and
that
it
was
her
own
baby
*NL*
crying
and
calling
for
her
,
went
into
the
garden
in
silence
.
There
he
*NL*
heard
at
once
that
the
groans
came
from
the
bath-house
that
stood
near
the
*NL*
garden
gate
,
and
that
they
were
the
groans
of
a
woman
.
Opening
the
door
of
*NL*
the
bath-house
,
he
saw
a
sight
which
petrified
him
.
An
idiot
girl
,
who
*NL*
wandered
about
the
streets
and
was
known
to
the
whole
town
by
the
nickname
*NL*
of
Lizaveta
Smerdyastchaya
-LRB-
Stinking
Lizaveta
-RRB-
,
had
got
into
the
bath
-
*NL*
house
and
had
just
given
birth
to
a
child
.
She
lay
dying
with
the
baby
*NL*
beside
her
.
She
said
nothing
,
for
she
had
never
been
able
to
speak
.
But
*NL*
her
story
needs
a
chapter
to
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
II
.
Lizaveta
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
circumstance
which
struck
Grigory
particularly
,
and
*NL*
confirmed
a
very
unpleasant
and
revolting
suspicion
.
This
Lizaveta
was
a
*NL*
dwarfish
creature
,
``
not
five
foot
within
a
wee
bit
,
''
as
many
of
the
pious
*NL*
old
women
said
pathetically
about
her
,
after
her
death
.
Her
broad
,
*NL*
healthy
,
red
face
had
a
look
of
blank
idiocy
and
the
fixed
stare
in
her
*NL*
eyes
was
unpleasant
,
in
spite
of
their
meek
expression
.
She
wandered
*NL*
about
,
summer
and
winter
alike
,
barefooted
,
wearing
nothing
but
a
hempen
*NL*
smock
.
Her
coarse
,
almost
black
hair
curled
like
lamb
's
wool
,
and
formed
a
*NL*
sort
of
huge
cap
on
her
head
.
It
was
always
crusted
with
mud
,
and
had
*NL*
leaves
,
bits
of
stick
,
and
shavings
clinging
to
it
,
as
she
always
slept
on
*NL*
the
ground
and
in
the
dirt
.
Her
father
,
a
homeless
,
sickly
drunkard
,
*NL*
called
Ilya
,
had
lost
everything
and
lived
many
years
as
a
workman
with
*NL*
some
well-to-do
tradespeople
.
Her
mother
had
long
been
dead
.
Spiteful
and
*NL*
diseased
,
Ilya
used
to
beat
Lizaveta
inhumanly
whenever
she
returned
to
*NL*
him
.
But
she
rarely
did
so
,
for
every
one
in
the
town
was
ready
to
look
*NL*
after
her
as
being
an
idiot
,
and
so
specially
dear
to
God
.
Ilya
's
*NL*
employers
,
and
many
others
in
the
town
,
especially
of
the
tradespeople
,
*NL*
tried
to
clothe
her
better
,
and
always
rigged
her
out
with
high
boots
and
*NL*
sheepskin
coat
for
the
winter
.
But
,
although
she
allowed
them
to
dress
her
*NL*
up
without
resisting
,
she
usually
went
away
,
preferably
to
the
cathedral
*NL*
porch
,
and
taking
off
all
that
had
been
given
her
--
kerchief
,
sheepskin
,
*NL*
skirt
or
boots
--
she
left
them
there
and
walked
away
barefoot
in
her
smock
*NL*
as
before
.
It
happened
on
one
occasion
that
a
new
governor
of
the
*NL*
province
,
making
a
tour
of
inspection
in
our
town
,
saw
Lizaveta
,
and
was
*NL*
wounded
in
his
tenderest
susceptibilities
.
And
though
he
was
told
she
was
*NL*
an
idiot
,
he
pronounced
that
for
a
young
woman
of
twenty
to
wander
about
*NL*
in
nothing
but
a
smock
was
a
breach
of
the
proprieties
,
and
must
not
occur
*NL*
again
.
But
the
governor
went
his
way
,
and
Lizaveta
was
left
as
she
was
.
At
*NL*
last
her
father
died
,
which
made
her
even
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
religious
persons
of
the
town
,
as
an
orphan
.
In
fact
,
every
one
seemed
*NL*
to
like
her
;
even
the
boys
did
not
tease
her
,
and
the
boys
of
our
town
,
*NL*
especially
the
schoolboys
,
are
a
mischievous
set
.
She
would
walk
into
*NL*
strange
houses
,
and
no
one
drove
her
away
.
Every
one
was
kind
to
her
and
*NL*
gave
her
something
.
If
she
were
given
a
copper
,
she
would
take
it
,
and
at
*NL*
once
drop
it
in
the
alms-jug
of
the
church
or
prison
.
If
she
were
given
a
*NL*
roll
or
bun
in
the
market
,
she
would
hand
it
to
the
first
child
she
met
.
*NL*
Sometimes
she
would
stop
one
of
the
richest
ladies
in
the
town
and
give
it
*NL*
to
her
,
and
the
lady
would
be
pleased
to
take
it
.
She
herself
never
tasted
*NL*
anything
but
black
bread
and
water
.
If
she
went
into
an
expensive
shop
,
*NL*
where
there
were
costly
goods
or
money
lying
about
,
no
one
kept
watch
on
*NL*
her
,
for
they
knew
that
if
she
saw
thousands
of
roubles
overlooked
by
*NL*
them
,
she
would
not
have
touched
a
farthing
.
She
scarcely
ever
went
to
*NL*
church
.
She
slept
either
in
the
church
porch
or
climbed
over
a
hurdle
*NL*
-LRB-
there
are
many
hurdles
instead
of
fences
to
this
day
in
our
town
-RRB-
into
a
*NL*
kitchen
garden
.
She
used
at
least
once
a
week
to
turn
up
``
at
home
,
''
that
*NL*
is
at
the
house
of
her
father
's
former
employers
,
and
in
the
winter
went
*NL*
there
every
night
,
and
slept
either
in
the
passage
or
the
cowhouse
.
People
*NL*
were
amazed
that
she
could
stand
such
a
life
,
but
she
was
accustomed
to
*NL*
it
,
and
,
although
she
was
so
tiny
,
she
was
of
a
robust
constitution
.
Some
*NL*
of
the
townspeople
declared
that
she
did
all
this
only
from
pride
,
but
*NL*
that
is
hardly
credible
.
She
could
hardly
speak
,
and
only
from
time
to
*NL*
time
uttered
an
inarticulate
grunt
.
How
could
she
have
been
proud
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
one
clear
,
warm
,
moonlight
night
in
September
-LRB-
many
years
ago
-RRB-
*NL*
five
or
six
drunken
revelers
were
returning
from
the
club
at
a
very
late
*NL*
hour
,
according
to
our
provincial
notions
.
They
passed
through
the
``
back
-
*NL*
way
,
''
which
led
between
the
back
gardens
of
the
houses
,
with
hurdles
on
*NL*
either
side
.
This
way
leads
out
on
to
the
bridge
over
the
long
,
stinking
*NL*
pool
which
we
were
accustomed
to
call
a
river
.
Among
the
nettles
and
*NL*
burdocks
under
the
hurdle
our
revelers
saw
Lizaveta
asleep
.
They
stopped
*NL*
to
look
at
her
,
laughing
,
and
began
jesting
with
unbridled
licentiousness
.
*NL*
It
occurred
to
one
young
gentleman
to
make
the
whimsical
inquiry
whether
*NL*
any
one
could
possibly
look
upon
such
an
animal
as
a
woman
,
and
so
*NL*
forth
...
They
all
pronounced
with
lofty
repugnance
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
.
But
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
was
among
them
,
sprang
forward
and
*NL*
declared
that
it
was
by
no
means
impossible
,
and
that
,
indeed
,
there
was
a
*NL*
certain
piquancy
about
it
,
and
so
on
...
It
is
true
that
at
that
time
he
*NL*
was
overdoing
his
part
as
a
buffoon
.
He
liked
to
put
himself
forward
and
*NL*
entertain
the
company
,
ostensibly
on
equal
terms
,
of
course
,
though
in
*NL*
reality
he
was
on
a
servile
footing
with
them
.
It
was
just
at
the
time
*NL*
when
he
had
received
the
news
of
his
first
wife
's
death
in
Petersburg
,
*NL*
and
,
with
crape
upon
his
hat
,
was
drinking
and
behaving
so
shamelessly
*NL*
that
even
the
most
reckless
among
us
were
shocked
at
the
sight
of
him
.
The
*NL*
revelers
,
of
course
,
laughed
at
this
unexpected
opinion
;
and
one
of
them
*NL*
even
began
challenging
him
to
act
upon
it
.
The
others
repelled
the
idea
*NL*
even
more
emphatically
,
although
still
with
the
utmost
hilarity
,
and
at
*NL*
last
they
went
on
their
way
.
Later
on
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
swore
that
he
had
*NL*
gone
with
them
,
and
perhaps
it
was
so
,
no
one
knows
for
certain
,
and
no
*NL*
one
ever
knew
.
But
five
or
six
months
later
,
all
the
town
was
talking
,
*NL*
with
intense
and
sincere
indignation
,
of
Lizaveta
's
condition
,
and
trying
*NL*
to
find
out
who
was
the
miscreant
who
had
wronged
her
.
Then
suddenly
a
*NL*
terrible
rumor
was
all
over
the
town
that
this
miscreant
was
no
other
than
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
Who
set
the
rumor
going
?
Of
that
drunken
band
five
had
*NL*
left
the
town
and
the
only
one
still
among
us
was
an
elderly
and
much
*NL*
respected
civil
councilor
,
the
father
of
grown-up
daughters
,
who
could
*NL*
hardly
have
spread
the
tale
,
even
if
there
had
been
any
foundation
for
it
.
*NL*
But
rumor
pointed
straight
at
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
and
persisted
in
pointing
*NL*
at
him
.
Of
course
this
was
no
great
grievance
to
him
:
he
would
not
have
*NL*
troubled
to
contradict
a
set
of
tradespeople
.
In
those
days
he
was
proud
,
*NL*
and
did
not
condescend
to
talk
except
in
his
own
circle
of
the
officials
*NL*
and
nobles
,
whom
he
entertained
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
,
Grigory
stood
up
for
his
master
vigorously
.
He
provoked
*NL*
quarrels
and
altercations
in
defense
of
him
and
succeeded
in
bringing
some
*NL*
people
round
to
his
side
.
``
It
's
the
wench
's
own
fault
,
''
he
asserted
,
and
*NL*
the
culprit
was
Karp
,
a
dangerous
convict
,
who
had
escaped
from
prison
and
*NL*
whose
name
was
well
known
to
us
,
as
he
had
hidden
in
our
town
.
This
*NL*
conjecture
sounded
plausible
,
for
it
was
remembered
that
Karp
had
been
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
just
at
that
time
in
the
autumn
,
and
had
robbed
three
*NL*
people
.
But
this
affair
and
all
the
talk
about
it
did
not
estrange
popular
*NL*
sympathy
from
the
poor
idiot
.
She
was
better
looked
after
than
ever
.
A
*NL*
well-to-do
merchant
's
widow
named
Kondratyev
arranged
to
take
her
into
her
*NL*
house
at
the
end
of
April
,
meaning
not
to
let
her
go
out
until
after
the
*NL*
confinement
.
They
kept
a
constant
watch
over
her
,
but
in
spite
of
their
*NL*
vigilance
she
escaped
on
the
very
last
day
,
and
made
her
way
into
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
garden
.
How
,
in
her
condition
,
she
managed
to
climb
over
the
*NL*
high
,
strong
fence
remained
a
mystery
.
Some
maintained
that
she
must
have
*NL*
been
lifted
over
by
somebody
;
others
hinted
at
something
more
uncanny
.
The
*NL*
most
likely
explanation
is
that
it
happened
naturally
--
that
Lizaveta
,
*NL*
accustomed
to
clambering
over
hurdles
to
sleep
in
gardens
,
had
somehow
*NL*
managed
to
climb
this
fence
,
in
spite
of
her
condition
,
and
had
leapt
*NL*
down
,
injuring
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
rushed
to
Marfa
and
sent
her
to
Lizaveta
,
while
he
ran
to
fetch
an
*NL*
old
midwife
who
lived
close
by
.
They
saved
the
baby
,
but
Lizaveta
died
at
*NL*
dawn
.
Grigory
took
the
baby
,
brought
it
home
,
and
making
his
wife
sit
*NL*
down
,
put
it
on
her
lap
.
``
A
child
of
God
--
an
orphan
is
akin
to
all
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
and
to
us
above
others
.
Our
little
lost
one
has
sent
us
this
,
who
*NL*
has
come
from
the
devil
's
son
and
a
holy
innocent
.
Nurse
him
and
weep
no
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Marfa
brought
up
the
child
.
He
was
christened
Pavel
,
to
which
people
*NL*
were
not
slow
in
adding
Fyodorovitch
-LRB-
son
of
Fyodor
-RRB-
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
did
not
object
to
any
of
this
,
and
thought
it
amusing
,
though
he
persisted
*NL*
vigorously
in
denying
his
responsibility
.
The
townspeople
were
pleased
at
*NL*
his
adopting
the
foundling
.
Later
on
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
invented
a
surname
*NL*
for
the
child
,
calling
him
Smerdyakov
,
after
his
mother
's
nickname
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
Smerdyakov
became
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
second
servant
,
and
was
*NL*
living
in
the
lodge
with
Grigory
and
Marfa
at
the
time
our
story
begins
.
*NL*
He
was
employed
as
cook
.
I
ought
to
say
something
of
this
Smerdyakov
,
but
*NL*
I
am
ashamed
of
keeping
my
readers
'
attention
so
long
occupied
with
these
*NL*
common
menials
,
and
I
will
go
back
to
my
story
,
hoping
to
say
more
of
*NL*
Smerdyakov
in
the
course
of
it
.

*NL*
Chapter
III
.
The
Confession
Of
A
Passionate
Heart
--
In
Verse
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
remained
for
some
time
irresolute
after
hearing
the
command
his
*NL*
father
shouted
to
him
from
the
carriage
.
But
in
spite
of
his
uneasiness
he
*NL*
did
not
stand
still
.
That
was
not
his
way
.
He
went
at
once
to
the
kitchen
*NL*
to
find
out
what
his
father
had
been
doing
above
.
Then
he
set
off
,
*NL*
trusting
that
on
the
way
he
would
find
some
answer
to
the
doubt
tormenting
*NL*
him
.
I
hasten
to
add
that
his
father
's
shouts
,
commanding
him
to
return
*NL*
home
``
with
his
mattress
and
pillow
''
did
not
frighten
him
in
the
least
.
He
*NL*
understood
perfectly
that
those
peremptory
shouts
were
merely
``
a
flourish
''
*NL*
to
produce
an
effect
.
In
the
same
way
a
tradesman
in
our
town
who
was
*NL*
celebrating
his
name-day
with
a
party
of
friends
,
getting
angry
at
being
*NL*
refused
more
vodka
,
smashed
up
his
own
crockery
and
furniture
and
tore
his
*NL*
own
and
his
wife
's
clothes
,
and
finally
broke
his
windows
,
all
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
effect
.
Next
day
,
of
course
,
when
he
was
sober
,
he
regretted
the
*NL*
broken
cups
and
saucers
.
Alyosha
knew
that
his
father
would
let
him
go
*NL*
back
to
the
monastery
next
day
,
possibly
even
that
evening
.
Moreover
,
he
*NL*
was
fully
persuaded
that
his
father
might
hurt
any
one
else
,
but
would
not
*NL*
hurt
him
.
Alyosha
was
certain
that
no
one
in
the
whole
world
ever
would
*NL*
want
to
hurt
him
,
and
,
what
is
more
,
he
knew
that
no
one
could
hurt
him
.
*NL*
This
was
for
him
an
axiom
,
assumed
once
for
all
without
question
,
and
he
*NL*
went
his
way
without
hesitation
,
relying
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
an
anxiety
of
a
different
sort
disturbed
him
,
and
*NL*
worried
him
the
more
because
he
could
not
formulate
it
.
It
was
the
fear
of
*NL*
a
woman
,
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
who
had
so
urgently
entreated
him
in
the
*NL*
note
handed
to
him
by
Madame
Hohlakov
to
come
and
see
her
about
something
.
*NL*
This
request
and
the
necessity
of
going
had
at
once
aroused
an
uneasy
*NL*
feeling
in
his
heart
,
and
this
feeling
had
grown
more
and
more
painful
all
*NL*
the
morning
in
spite
of
the
scenes
at
the
hermitage
and
at
the
Father
*NL*
Superior
's
.
He
was
not
uneasy
because
he
did
not
know
what
she
would
speak
*NL*
of
and
what
he
must
answer
.
And
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
simply
as
a
*NL*
woman
.
Though
he
knew
little
of
women
,
he
had
spent
his
life
,
from
early
*NL*
childhood
till
he
entered
the
monastery
,
entirely
with
women
.
He
was
*NL*
afraid
of
that
woman
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
He
had
been
afraid
of
her
from
*NL*
the
first
time
he
saw
her
.
He
had
only
seen
her
two
or
three
times
,
and
*NL*
had
only
chanced
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
.
He
thought
of
her
as
a
*NL*
beautiful
,
proud
,
imperious
girl
.
It
was
not
her
beauty
which
troubled
*NL*
him
,
but
something
else
.
And
the
vagueness
of
his
apprehension
increased
*NL*
the
apprehension
itself
.
The
girl
's
aims
were
of
the
noblest
,
he
knew
*NL*
that
.
She
was
trying
to
save
his
brother
Dmitri
simply
through
generosity
,
*NL*
though
he
had
already
behaved
badly
to
her
.
Yet
,
although
Alyosha
*NL*
recognized
and
did
justice
to
all
these
fine
and
generous
sentiments
,
a
*NL*
shiver
began
to
run
down
his
back
as
soon
as
he
drew
near
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
that
he
would
not
find
Ivan
,
who
was
so
intimate
a
friend
,
*NL*
with
her
,
for
Ivan
was
certainly
now
with
his
father
.
Dmitri
he
was
even
*NL*
more
certain
not
to
find
there
,
and
he
had
a
foreboding
of
the
reason
.
And
*NL*
so
his
conversation
would
be
with
her
alone
.
He
had
a
great
longing
to
run
*NL*
and
see
his
brother
Dmitri
before
that
fateful
interview
.
Without
showing
*NL*
him
the
letter
,
he
could
talk
to
him
about
it
.
But
Dmitri
lived
a
long
way
*NL*
off
,
and
he
was
sure
to
be
away
from
home
too
.
Standing
still
for
a
*NL*
minute
,
he
reached
a
final
decision
.
Crossing
himself
with
a
rapid
and
*NL*
accustomed
gesture
,
and
at
once
smiling
,
he
turned
resolutely
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
his
terrible
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
her
house
.
If
he
went
by
the
High
Street
and
then
across
the
*NL*
market-place
,
it
was
a
long
way
round
.
Though
our
town
is
small
,
it
is
*NL*
scattered
,
and
the
houses
are
far
apart
.
And
meanwhile
his
father
was
*NL*
expecting
him
,
and
perhaps
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
command
.
He
might
be
*NL*
unreasonable
,
and
so
he
had
to
make
haste
to
get
there
and
back
.
So
he
*NL*
decided
to
take
a
short
cut
by
the
back-way
,
for
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
*NL*
ground
.
This
meant
skirting
fences
,
climbing
over
hurdles
,
and
crossing
*NL*
other
people
's
back-yards
,
where
every
one
he
met
knew
him
and
greeted
*NL*
him
.
In
this
way
he
could
reach
the
High
Street
in
half
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
pass
the
garden
adjoining
his
father
's
,
and
belonging
to
a
*NL*
little
tumbledown
house
with
four
windows
.
The
owner
of
this
house
,
as
*NL*
Alyosha
knew
,
was
a
bedridden
old
woman
,
living
with
her
daughter
,
who
had
*NL*
been
a
genteel
maid-servant
in
generals
'
families
in
Petersburg
.
Now
she
*NL*
had
been
at
home
a
year
,
looking
after
her
sick
mother
.
She
always
dressed
*NL*
up
in
fine
clothes
,
though
her
old
mother
and
she
had
sunk
into
such
*NL*
poverty
that
they
went
every
day
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
kitchen
for
soup
*NL*
and
bread
,
which
Marfa
gave
readily
.
Yet
,
though
the
young
woman
came
up
*NL*
for
soup
,
she
had
never
sold
any
of
her
dresses
,
and
one
of
these
even
had
*NL*
a
long
train
--
a
fact
which
Alyosha
had
learned
from
Rakitin
,
who
always
*NL*
knew
everything
that
was
going
on
in
the
town
.
He
had
forgotten
it
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
heard
it
,
but
now
,
on
reaching
the
garden
,
he
remembered
the
dress
*NL*
with
the
train
,
raised
his
head
,
which
had
been
bowed
in
thought
,
and
came
*NL*
upon
something
quite
unexpected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
hurdle
in
the
garden
,
Dmitri
,
mounted
on
something
,
was
leaning
*NL*
forward
,
gesticulating
violently
,
beckoning
to
him
,
obviously
afraid
to
*NL*
utter
a
word
for
fear
of
being
overheard
.
Alyosha
ran
up
to
the
hurdle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
thing
you
looked
up
.
I
was
nearly
shouting
to
you
,
''
Mitya
*NL*
said
in
a
joyful
,
hurried
whisper
.
``
Climb
in
here
quickly
!
How
splendid
*NL*
that
you
've
come
!
I
was
just
thinking
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
delighted
too
,
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
over
the
hurdle
.
*NL*
Mitya
put
his
powerful
hand
under
his
elbow
to
help
him
jump
.
Tucking
up
*NL*
his
cassock
,
Alyosha
leapt
over
the
hurdle
with
the
agility
of
a
bare
-
*NL*
legged
street
urchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
!
Now
come
along
,
''
said
Mitya
in
an
enthusiastic
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
whispered
Alyosha
,
looking
about
him
and
finding
himself
in
a
*NL*
deserted
garden
with
no
one
near
but
themselves
.
The
garden
was
small
,
but
*NL*
the
house
was
at
least
fifty
paces
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
here
.
Why
do
you
whisper
?
''
asked
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
I
whisper
?
Deuce
take
it
!
''
cried
Dmitri
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
``
You
see
what
silly
tricks
nature
plays
one
.
I
am
here
in
secret
,
and
on
*NL*
the
watch
.
I
'll
explain
later
on
,
but
,
knowing
it
's
a
secret
,
I
began
*NL*
whispering
like
a
fool
,
when
there
's
no
need
.
Let
us
go
.
Over
there
.
Till
*NL*
then
be
quiet
.
I
want
to
kiss
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Glory
to
God
in
the
world
,
*NL*
Glory
to
God
in
me
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
just
repeating
that
,
sitting
here
,
before
you
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
was
about
three
acres
in
extent
,
and
planted
with
trees
only
*NL*
along
the
fence
at
the
four
sides
.
There
were
apple-trees
,
maples
,
limes
*NL*
and
birch-trees
.
The
middle
of
the
garden
was
an
empty
grass
space
,
from
*NL*
which
several
hundredweight
of
hay
was
carried
in
the
summer
.
The
garden
*NL*
was
let
out
for
a
few
roubles
for
the
summer
.
There
were
also
plantations
*NL*
of
raspberries
and
currants
and
gooseberries
laid
out
along
the
sides
;
a
*NL*
kitchen
garden
had
been
planted
lately
near
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
led
his
brother
to
the
most
secluded
corner
of
the
garden
.
There
,
*NL*
in
a
thicket
of
lime-trees
and
old
bushes
of
black
currant
,
elder
,
*NL*
snowball-tree
,
and
lilac
,
there
stood
a
tumble-down
green
summer-house
,
*NL*
blackened
with
age
.
Its
walls
were
of
lattice-work
,
but
there
was
still
a
*NL*
roof
which
could
give
shelter
.
God
knows
when
this
summer-house
was
built
.
*NL*
There
was
a
tradition
that
it
had
been
put
up
some
fifty
years
before
by
a
*NL*
retired
colonel
called
von
Schmidt
,
who
owned
the
house
at
that
time
.
It
*NL*
was
all
in
decay
,
the
floor
was
rotting
,
the
planks
were
loose
,
the
*NL*
woodwork
smelled
musty
.
In
the
summer-house
there
was
a
green
wooden
table
*NL*
fixed
in
the
ground
,
and
round
it
were
some
green
benches
upon
which
it
*NL*
was
still
possible
to
sit
.
Alyosha
had
at
once
observed
his
brother
's
*NL*
exhilarated
condition
,
and
on
entering
the
arbor
he
saw
half
a
bottle
of
*NL*
brandy
and
a
wineglass
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
brandy
,
''
Mitya
laughed
.
``
I
see
your
look
:
`
He
's
drinking
again
!
'
*NL*
Distrust
the
apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Distrust
the
worthless
,
lying
crowd
,
*NL*
And
lay
aside
thy
doubts
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
not
drinking
,
I
'm
only
`
indulging
,
'
as
that
pig
,
your
Rakitin
,
says
.
*NL*
He
'll
be
a
civil
councilor
one
day
,
but
he
'll
always
talk
about
*NL*
`
indulging
.
'
Sit
down
.
I
could
take
you
in
my
arms
,
Alyosha
,
and
press
you
*NL*
to
my
bosom
till
I
crush
you
,
for
in
the
whole
world
--
in
reality
--
in
re-al
-
*NL*
i-ty
--
-LRB-
can
you
take
it
in
?
-RRB-
I
love
no
one
but
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
uttered
the
last
words
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
but
you
and
one
`
jade
'
I
have
fallen
in
love
with
,
to
my
ruin
.
But
*NL*
being
in
love
does
n't
mean
loving
.
You
may
be
in
love
with
a
woman
and
yet
*NL*
hate
her
.
Remember
that
!
I
can
talk
about
it
gayly
still
.
Sit
down
here
by
*NL*
the
table
and
I
'll
sit
beside
you
and
look
at
you
,
and
go
on
talking
.
You
*NL*
shall
keep
quiet
and
I
'll
go
on
talking
,
for
the
time
has
come
.
But
on
*NL*
reflection
,
you
know
,
I
'd
better
speak
quietly
,
for
here
--
here
--
you
can
*NL*
never
tell
what
ears
are
listening
.
I
will
explain
everything
;
as
they
*NL*
say
,
`
the
story
will
be
continued
.
'
Why
have
I
been
longing
for
you
?
Why
*NL*
have
I
been
thirsting
for
you
all
these
days
,
and
just
now
?
-LRB-
It
's
five
*NL*
days
since
I
've
cast
anchor
here
.
-RRB-
Because
it
's
only
to
you
I
can
tell
*NL*
everything
;
because
I
must
,
because
I
need
you
,
because
to-morrow
I
shall
*NL*
fly
from
the
clouds
,
because
to-morrow
life
is
ending
and
beginning
.
Have
*NL*
you
ever
felt
,
have
you
ever
dreamt
of
falling
down
a
precipice
into
a
*NL*
pit
?
That
's
just
how
I
'm
falling
,
but
not
in
a
dream
.
And
I
'm
not
afraid
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
you
be

At

,
I
am
afraid

but
I
enjoy
it
.
It
's
not
*NL*
enjoyment
though
,
but
ecstasy

Damn
it
all
,
whatever
it
is
!
A
strong
*NL*
spirit
,
a
weak
spirit
,
a
womanish
spirit
--
whatever
it
is
!
Let
us
praise
*NL*
nature
:
you
see
what
sunshine
,
how
clear
the
sky
is
,
the
leaves
are
all
*NL*
green
,
it
's
still
summer
;
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
the
stillness
!
*NL*
Where
were
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
father

I
meant

go

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
her

Oo

what
a
coincidence

Why
was
I
waiting
for

Hungering
and
thirsting
for
you
in
every
cranny
of
my
soul

even
in
my

Why

to
send
you

Katerina
Ivanovna

so
as

*NL*
have
done
with

To

I

Dmitri
stood
up

thought
a

put
his

to
his

*NL*

Here

Alyosha
took
it
out

Mitya
looked
*NL*
through
it
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you

going

Oh

I
thank
you
for
sending
him

back-way

and
he
came
to
me
like
the
golden
fish
to
the
silly

in

Listen

Alyosha

listen

brother

Now
I
mean
to
*NL*
tell
you
everything

for
I
must
tell
some

An

in

I

told
already

but
I
want

tell
an

You
are
an

You
will
hear

judge

And
that
's
what
I
need

that

some

forgive

Listen

If

*NL*
``

made
up

He

Mitya

am

in

I
am

me
specially

All
we
*NL*

are
such
insects

and
,
angel
as
you
are
,
that
insect
lives
in
*NL*
you
,
too

and
will
stir
up
a
tempest
in
your
blood

Tempests
,
because
*NL*
sensual
lust
is
a
tempest
--
worse
than
a
tempest
!
Beauty
is
a
terrible
and
*NL*
awful
thing
!
It
is
terrible
because
it
has
not
been
fathomed
and
never
can
*NL*
be
fathomed
,
for
God
sets
us
nothing
but
riddles
.
Here
the
boundaries
meet
*NL*
and
all
contradictions
exist
side
by
side
.
I
am
not
a
cultivated
man
,
*NL*
brother
,
but
I
've
thought
a
lot
about
this
.
It
's
terrible
what
mysteries
*NL*
there
are
!
Too
many
riddles
weigh
men
down
on
earth
.
We
must
solve
them
as
*NL*
we
can
,
and
try
to
keep
a
dry
skin
in
the
water
.
Beauty
!
I
ca
n't
endure
*NL*
the
thought
that
a
man
of
lofty
mind
and
heart
begins
with
the
ideal
of
*NL*
the
Madonna
and
ends
with
the
ideal
of
Sodom
.
What
's
still
more
awful
is
*NL*
that
a
man
with
the
ideal
of
Sodom
in
his
soul
does
not
renounce
the
ideal
*NL*
of
the
Madonna
,
and
his
heart
may
be
on
fire
with
that
ideal
,
genuinely
on
*NL*
fire
,
just
as
in
his
days
of
youth
and
innocence
.
Yes
,
man
is
broad
,
too
*NL*
broad
,
indeed
.
I
'd
have
him
narrower
.
The
devil
only
knows
what
to
make
of
*NL*
it
!
What
to
the
mind
is
shameful
is
beauty
and
nothing
else
to
the
heart
.
*NL*
Is
there
beauty
in
Sodom
?
Believe
me
,
that
for
the
immense
mass
of
mankind
*NL*
beauty
is
found
in
Sodom
.
Did
you
know
that
secret
?
The
awful
thing
is
*NL*
that
beauty
is
mysterious
as
well
as
terrible
.
God
and
the
devil
are
*NL*
fighting
there
and
the
battlefield
is
the
heart
of
man
.
But
a
man
always
*NL*
talks
of
his
own
ache
.

Chapter

The
Confession
Of
A
Passionate
Heart
--
In
Anecdote
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
leading
a
wild
life
then
.
Father
said
just
now
that
I
spent
several
*NL*
thousand
roubles
in
seducing
young
girls
.
That
's
a
swinish
invention
,
and
*NL*
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
.
And
if
there
was
,
I
did
n't
need
money
*NL*
simply
for
_
that
_
.
With
me
money
is
an
accessory
,
the
overflow
of
my
*NL*
heart
,
the
framework
.
To-day
she
would
be
my
lady
,
to-morrow
a
wench
out
*NL*
of
the
streets
in
her
place
.
I
entertained
them
both
.
I
threw
away
money
*NL*
by
the
handful
on
music
,
rioting
,
and
gypsies
.
Sometimes
I
gave
it
to
the
*NL*
ladies
,
too
,
for
they
'll
take
it
greedily
,
that
must
be
admitted
,
and
be
*NL*
pleased
and
thankful
for
it
.
Ladies
used
to
be
fond
of
me
:
not
all
of
*NL*
them
,
but
it
happened
,
it
happened
.
But
I
always
liked
side-paths
,
little
*NL*
dark
back-alleys
behind
the
main
road
--
there
one
finds
adventures
and
*NL*
surprises
,
and
precious
metal
in
the
dirt
.
I
am
speaking
figuratively
,
*NL*
brother
.
In
the
town
I
was
in
,
there
were
no
such
back-alleys
in
the
*NL*
literal
sense
,
but
morally
there
were
.
If
you
were
like
me
,
you
'd
know
*NL*
what
that
means
.
I
loved
vice
,
I
loved
the
ignominy
of
vice
.
I
loved
*NL*
cruelty
;
am
I
not
a
bug
,
am
I
not
a
noxious
insect
?
In
fact
a
Karamazov
!
*NL*
Once
we
went
,
a
whole
lot
of
us
,
for
a
picnic
,
in
seven
sledges
.
It
was
*NL*
dark
,
it
was
winter
,
and
I
began
squeezing
a
girl
's
hand
,
and
forced
her
*NL*
to
kiss
me
.
She
was
the
daughter
of
an
official
,
a
sweet
,
gentle
,
*NL*
submissive
creature
.
She
allowed
me
,
she
allowed
me
much
in
the
dark
.
She
*NL*
thought
,
poor
thing
,
that
I
should
come
next
day
to
make
her
an
offer
-LRB-
I
*NL*
was
looked
upon
as
a
good
match
,
too
-RRB-
.
But
I
did
n't
say
a
word
to
her
for
*NL*
five
months
.
I
used
to
see
her
in
a
corner
at
dances
-LRB-
we
were
always
*NL*
having
dances
-RRB-
,
her
eyes
watching
me
.
I
saw
how
they
glowed
with
fire
--
a
*NL*
fire
of
gentle
indignation
.
This
game
only
tickled
that
insect
lust
I
*NL*
cherished
in
my
soul
.
Five
months
later
she
married
an
official
and
left
*NL*
the
town
,
still
angry
,
and
still
,
perhaps
,
in
love
with
me
.
Now
they
live
*NL*
happily
.
Observe
that
I
told
no
one
.
I
did
n't
boast
of
it
.
Though
I
'm
full
*NL*
of
low
desires
,
and
love
what
's
low
,
I
'm
not
dishonorable
.
You
're
*NL*
blushing
;
your
eyes
flashed
.
Enough
of
this
filth
with
you
.
And
all
this
*NL*
was
nothing
much
--
wayside
blossoms
_
a
la
_
Paul
de
Kock
--
though
the
cruel
*NL*
insect
had
already
grown
strong
in
my
soul
.
I
've
a
perfect
album
of
*NL*
reminiscences
,
brother
.
God
bless
them
,
the
darlings
.
I
tried
to
break
it
*NL*
off
without
quarreling
.
And
I
never
gave
them
away
.
I
never
bragged
of
one
*NL*
of
them
.
But
that
's
enough
.
You
ca
n't
suppose
I
brought
you
here
simply
to
*NL*
talk
of
such
nonsense
.
No
,
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
something
more
curious
;
*NL*
and
do
n't
be
surprised
that
I
'm
glad
to
tell
you
,
instead
of
being
*NL*
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
because
I
blushed
,
''
Alyosha
said
suddenly
.
``
I
was
n't
*NL*
blushing
at
what
you
were
saying
or
at
what
you
've
done

I
blushed
because
*NL*
I
am
the
same
as
you
are
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
Come
,
that
's
going
a
little
too
far
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
too
far
,
''
said
Alyosha
warmly
-LRB-
obviously
the
idea
was
not
a
*NL*
new
one
-RRB-

``
The
ladder
's
the
same

I
'm
at
the
bottom
step

and
you
're
*NL*
above

somewhere
about
the
thirteenth
.
That
's
how
I
see
it
.
But
it
's
all
*NL*
the
same
.
Absolutely
the
same
in
kind
.
Any
one
on
the
bottom
step
is
bound
*NL*
to
go
up
to
the
top
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
one
ought
not
to
step
on
at
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
one
who
can
help
it
had
better
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Alyosha
,
hush

darling
!
I
could
kiss
your
hand
,
you
touch
me
so
.
*NL*
That
rogue
Grushenka
has
an
eye
for
men
.
She
told
me
once
that
she
'd
*NL*
devour
you
one
day
.
There
,
there
,
I
wo
n't
!
From
this
field
of
corruption
*NL*
fouled
by
flies
,
let
's
pass
to
my
tragedy
,
also
befouled
by
flies
,
that
is
*NL*
by
every
sort
of
vileness
.
Although
the
old
man
told
lies
about
my
*NL*
seducing
innocence
,
there
really
was
something
of
the
sort
in
my
tragedy
,
*NL*
though
it
was
only
once
,
and
then
it
did
not
come
off
.
The
old
man
who
has
*NL*
reproached
me
with
what
never
happened
does
not
even
know
of
this
fact
;
I
*NL*
never
told
any
one
about
it
.
You
're
the
first
,
except
Ivan
,
of
course
--
Ivan
*NL*
knows
everything
.
He
knew
about
it
long
before
you
.
But
Ivan
's
a
tomb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
's
a
tomb
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
listened
with
great
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
lieutenant
in
a
line
regiment
,
but
still
I
was
under
supervision
,
*NL*
like
a
kind
of
convict
.
Yet
I
was
awfully
well
received
in
the
little
*NL*
town
.
I
spent
money
right
and
left
.
I
was
thought
to
be
rich
;
I
thought
so
*NL*
myself
.
But
I
must
have
pleased
them
in
other
ways
as
well
.
Although
they
*NL*
shook
their
heads
over
me
,
they
liked
me
.
My
colonel
,
who
was
an
old
man
,
*NL*
took
a
sudden
dislike
to
me
.
He
was
always
down
upon
me
,
but
I
had
*NL*
powerful
friends
,
and
,
moreover
,
all
the
town
was
on
my
side
,
so
he
*NL*
could
n't
do
me
much
harm
.
I
was
in
fault
myself
for
refusing
to
treat
him
*NL*
with
proper
respect
.
I
was
proud
.
This
obstinate
old
fellow
,
who
was
*NL*
really
a
very
good
sort
,
kind-hearted
and
hospitable
,
had
had
two
wives
,
*NL*
both
dead
.
His
first
wife
,
who
was
of
a
humble
family
,
left
a
daughter
as
*NL*
unpretentious
as
herself
.
She
was
a
young
woman
of
four
and
twenty
when
I
*NL*
was
there
,
and
was
living
with
her
father
and
an
aunt
,
her
mother
's
*NL*
sister
.
The
aunt
was
simple
and
illiterate
;
the
niece
was
simple
but
*NL*
lively
.
I
like
to
say
nice
things
about
people
.
I
never
knew
a
woman
of
*NL*
more
charming
character
than
Agafya
--
fancy
,
her
name
was
Agafya
Ivanovna
!
*NL*
And
she
was
n't
bad-looking
either
,
in
the
Russian
style
:
tall
,
stout
,
with
*NL*
a
full
figure
,
and
beautiful
eyes
,
though
a
rather
coarse
face
.
She
had
*NL*
not
married
,
although
she
had
had
two
suitors
.
She
refused
them
,
but
was
*NL*
as
cheerful
as
ever
.
I
was
intimate
with
her
,
not
in
`
that
'
way
,
it
was
*NL*
pure
friendship
.
I
have
often
been
friendly
with
women
quite
innocently
.
I
*NL*
used
to
talk
to
her
with
shocking
frankness
,
and
she
only
laughed
.
Many
*NL*
women
like
such
freedom
,
and
she
was
a
girl
too
,
which
made
it
very
*NL*
amusing
.
Another
thing
,
one
could
never
think
of
her
as
a
young
lady
.
She
*NL*
and
her
aunt
lived
in
her
father
's
house
with
a
sort
of
voluntary
*NL*
humility
,
not
putting
themselves
on
an
equality
with
other
people
.
She
was
*NL*
a
general
favorite
,
and
of
use
to
every
one
,
for
she
was
a
clever
*NL*
dressmaker
.
She
had
a
talent
for
it
.
She
gave
her
services
freely
without
*NL*
asking
for
payment
,
but
if
any
one
offered
her
payment
,
she
did
n't
refuse
.
*NL*
The
colonel
,
of
course
,
was
a
very
different
matter
.
He
was
one
of
the
*NL*
chief
personages
in
the
district
.
He
kept
open
house
,
entertained
the
*NL*
whole
town
,
gave
suppers
and
dances
.
At
the
time
I
arrived
and
joined
the
*NL*
battalion
,
all
the
town
was
talking
of
the
expected
return
of
the
*NL*
colonel
's
second
daughter
,
a
great
beauty
,
who
had
just
left
a
fashionable
*NL*
school
in
the
capital
.
This
second
daughter
is
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
she
*NL*
was
the
child
of
the
second
wife
,
who
belonged
to
a
distinguished
*NL*
general
's
family
;
although
,
as
I
learnt
on
good
authority
,
she
too
brought
*NL*
the
colonel
no
money
.
She
had
connections
,
and
that
was
all
.
There
may
*NL*
have
been
expectations
,
but
they
had
come
to
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
when
the
young
lady
came
from
boarding-school
on
a
visit
,
the
whole
*NL*
town
revived
.
Our
most
distinguished
ladies
--
two
`
Excellencies
'
and
a
*NL*
colonel
's
wife
--
and
all
the
rest
following
their
lead
,
at
once
took
her
up
*NL*
and
gave
entertainments
in
her
honor
.
She
was
the
belle
of
the
balls
and
*NL*
picnics
,
and
they
got
up
_
tableaux
vivants
_
in
aid
of
distressed
*NL*
governesses
.
I
took
no
notice
,
I
went
on
as
wildly
as
before
,
and
one
of
*NL*
my
exploits
at
the
time
set
all
the
town
talking
.
I
saw
her
eyes
taking
my
*NL*
measure
one
evening
at
the
battery
commander
's
,
but
I
did
n't
go
up
to
her
,
*NL*
as
though
I
disdained
her
acquaintance
.
I
did
go
up
and
speak
to
her
at
an
*NL*
evening
party
not
long
after
.
She
scarcely
looked
at
me
,
and
compressed
*NL*
her
lips
scornfully
.
`
Wait
a
bit
.
I
'll
have
my
revenge
,
'
thought
I.
I
*NL*
behaved
like
an
awful
fool
on
many
occasions
at
that
time
,
and
I
was
*NL*
conscious
of
it
myself
.
What
made
it
worse
was
that
I
felt
that
`
Katenka
'
*NL*
was
not
an
innocent
boarding-school
miss
,
but
a
person
of
character
,
proud
*NL*
and
really
high-principled
;
above
all
,
she
had
education
and
intellect
,
*NL*
and
I
had
neither
.
You
think
I
meant
to
make
her
an
offer
?
No
,
I
simply
*NL*
wanted
to
revenge
myself
,
because
I
was
such
a
hero
and
she
did
n't
seem
to
*NL*
feel
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
I
spent
my
time
in
drink
and
riot
,
till
the
lieutenant-colonel
*NL*
put
me
under
arrest
for
three
days
.
Just
at
that
time
father
sent
me
six
*NL*
thousand
roubles
in
return
for
my
sending
him
a
deed
giving
up
all
claims
*NL*
upon
him
--
settling
our
accounts
,
so
to
speak
,
and
saying
that
I
would
n't
*NL*
expect
anything
more
.
I
did
n't
understand
a
word
of
it
at
the
time
.
Until
*NL*
I
came
here
,
Alyosha
,
till
the
last
few
days
,
indeed
,
perhaps
even
now
,
I
*NL*
have
n't
been
able
to
make
head
or
tail
of
my
money
affairs
with
father
.
*NL*
But
never
mind
that
,
we
'll
talk
of
it
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
I
received
the
money
,
I
got
a
letter
from
a
friend
telling
me
*NL*
something
that
interested
me
immensely
.
The
authorities
,
I
learnt
,
were
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
our
lieutenant-colonel
.
He
was
suspected
of
*NL*
irregularities
;
in
fact
,
his
enemies
were
preparing
a
surprise
for
him
.
*NL*
And
then
the
commander
of
the
division
arrived
,
and
kicked
up
the
devil
of
*NL*
a
shindy
.
Shortly
afterwards
he
was
ordered
to
retire
.
I
wo
n't
tell
you
*NL*
how
it
all
happened
.
He
had
enemies
certainly
.
Suddenly
there
was
a
marked
*NL*
coolness
in
the
town
towards
him
and
all
his
family
.
His
friends
all
*NL*
turned
their
backs
on
him
.
Then
I
took
my
first
step
.
I
met
Agafya
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
with
whom
I
'd
always
kept
up
a
friendship
,
and
said
,
`
Do
you
*NL*
know
there
's
a
deficit
of
4,500
roubles
of
government
money
in
your
*NL*
father
's
accounts
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
do
you
mean
?
What
makes
you
say
so
?
The
general
was
here
not
long
*NL*
ago
,
and
everything
was
all
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Then
it
was
,
but
now
it
is
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
terribly
scared
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
n't
frighten
me
!
'
she
said
.
`
Who
told
you
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
'
I
said
,
'
I
wo
n't
tell
any
one
.
You
know
I
'm
as
silent
*NL*
as
the
tomb
.
I
only
wanted
,
in
view
of
``
possibilities
,
''
to
add
,
that
when
*NL*
they
demand
that
4,500
roubles
from
your
father
,
and
he
ca
n't
produce
it
,
*NL*
he
'll
be
tried
,
and
made
to
serve
as
a
common
soldier
in
his
old
age
,
*NL*
unless
you
like
to
send
me
your
young
lady
secretly
.
I
've
just
had
money
*NL*
paid
me
.
I
'll
give
her
four
thousand
,
if
you
like
,
and
keep
the
secret
*NL*
religiously
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ah
,
you
scoundrel
!
'
--
that
's
what
she
said
.
`
You
wicked
scoundrel
!
How
*NL*
dare
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
away
furiously
indignant
,
while
I
shouted
after
her
once
more
*NL*
that
the
secret
should
be
kept
sacred
.
Those
two
simple
creatures
,
Agafya
*NL*
and
her
aunt
,
I
may
as
well
say
at
once
,
behaved
like
perfect
angels
all
*NL*
through
this
business
.
They
genuinely
adored
their
`
Katya
,
'
thought
her
*NL*
far
above
them
,
and
waited
on
her
,
hand
and
foot
.
But
Agafya
told
her
of
*NL*
our
conversation
.
I
found
that
out
afterwards
.
She
did
n't
keep
it
back
,
*NL*
and
of
course
that
was
all
I
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
the
new
major
arrived
to
take
command
of
the
battalion
.
The
old
*NL*
lieutenant-colonel
was
taken
ill
at
once
,
could
n't
leave
his
room
for
two
*NL*
days
,
and
did
n't
hand
over
the
government
money
.
Dr.
Kravchenko
declared
*NL*
that
he
really
was
ill
.
But
I
knew
for
a
fact
,
and
had
known
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
that
for
the
last
four
years
the
money
had
never
been
in
his
hands
*NL*
except
when
the
Commander
made
his
visits
of
inspection
.
He
used
to
lend
*NL*
it
to
a
trustworthy
person
,
a
merchant
of
our
town
called
Trifonov
,
an
old
*NL*
widower
,
with
a
big
beard
and
gold-rimmed
spectacles
.
He
used
to
go
to
the
*NL*
fair
,
do
a
profitable
business
with
the
money
,
and
return
the
whole
sum
to
*NL*
the
colonel
,
bringing
with
it
a
present
from
the
fair
,
as
well
as
interest
*NL*
on
the
loan
.
But
this
time
-LRB-
I
heard
all
about
it
quite
by
chance
from
*NL*
Trifonov
's
son
and
heir
,
a
driveling
youth
and
one
of
the
most
vicious
in
*NL*
the
world
-RRB-
--
this
time
,
I
say
,
Trifonov
brought
nothing
back
from
the
fair
.
*NL*
The
lieutenant-colonel
flew
to
him
.
`
I
've
never
received
any
money
from
*NL*
you
,
and
could
n't
possibly
have
received
any
.
'
That
was
all
the
answer
he
*NL*
got
.
So
now
our
lieutenant-colonel
is
confined
to
the
house
,
with
a
towel
*NL*
round
his
head
,
while
they
're
all
three
busy
putting
ice
on
it
.
All
at
*NL*
once
an
orderly
arrives
on
the
scene
with
the
book
and
the
order
to
`
hand
*NL*
over
the
battalion
money
immediately
,
within
two
hours
.
'
He
signed
the
*NL*
book
-LRB-
I
saw
the
signature
in
the
book
afterwards
-RRB-
,
stood
up
,
saying
he
*NL*
would
put
on
his
uniform
,
ran
to
his
bedroom
,
loaded
his
double-barreled
*NL*
gun
with
a
service
bullet
,
took
the
boot
off
his
right
foot
,
fixed
the
gun
*NL*
against
his
chest
,
and
began
feeling
for
the
trigger
with
his
foot
.
But
*NL*
Agafya
,
remembering
what
I
had
told
her
,
had
her
suspicions
.
She
stole
up
*NL*
and
peeped
into
the
room
just
in
time
.
She
rushed
in
,
flung
herself
upon
*NL*
him
from
behind
,
threw
her
arms
round
him
,
and
the
gun
went
off
,
hit
the
*NL*
ceiling
,
but
hurt
no
one
.
The
others
ran
in
,
took
away
the
gun
,
and
held
*NL*
him
by
the
arms
.
I
heard
all
about
this
afterwards
.
I
was
at
home
,
it
was
*NL*
getting
dusk
,
and
I
was
just
preparing
to
go
out
.
I
had
dressed
,
brushed
*NL*
my
hair
,
scented
my
handkerchief
,
and
taken
up
my
cap
,
when
suddenly
the
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
facing
me
in
the
room
stood
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
strange
how
things
happen
sometimes
.
No
one
had
seen
her
in
the
*NL*
street
,
so
that
no
one
knew
of
it
in
the
town
.
I
lodged
with
two
decrepit
*NL*
old
ladies
,
who
looked
after
me
.
They
were
most
obliging
old
things
,
ready
*NL*
to
do
anything
for
me
,
and
at
my
request
were
as
silent
afterwards
as
two
*NL*
cast-iron
posts
.
Of
course
I
grasped
the
position
at
once
.
She
walked
in
*NL*
and
looked
straight
at
me
,
her
dark
eyes
determined
,
even
defiant
,
but
on
*NL*
her
lips
and
round
her
mouth
I
saw
uncertainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
sister
told
me
,
'
she
began
,
`
that
you
would
give
me
4,500
roubles
if
*NL*
I
came
to
you
for
it
--
myself
.
I
have
come
...
give
me
the
money
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
keep
it
up
.
She
was
breathless
,
frightened
,
her
voice
failed
*NL*
her
,
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
the
lines
round
it
quivered
.
*NL*
Alyosha
,
are
you
listening
,
or
are
you
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
I
know
you
will
tell
the
whole
truth
,
''
said
Alyosha
in
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
telling
it
.
If
I
tell
the
whole
truth
just
as
it
happened
I
sha
n't
*NL*
spare
myself
.
My
first
idea
was
a
--
Karamazov
one
.
Once
I
was
bitten
by
a
*NL*
centipede
,
brother
,
and
laid
up
a
fortnight
with
fever
from
it
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
felt
a
centipede
biting
at
my
heart
then
--
a
noxious
insect
,
you
understand
?
*NL*
I
looked
her
up
and
down
.
You
've
seen
her
?
She
's
a
beauty
.
But
she
was
*NL*
beautiful
in
another
way
then
.
At
that
moment
she
was
beautiful
because
*NL*
she
was
noble
,
and
I
was
a
scoundrel
;
she
in
all
the
grandeur
of
her
*NL*
generosity
and
sacrifice
for
her
father
,
and
I
--
a
bug
!
And
,
scoundrel
as
I
*NL*
was
,
she
was
altogether
at
my
mercy
,
body
and
soul
.
She
was
hemmed
in
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
frankly
,
that
thought
,
that
venomous
thought
,
so
possessed
my
*NL*
heart
that
it
almost
swooned
with
suspense
.
It
seemed
as
if
there
could
be
*NL*
no
resisting
it
;
as
though
I
should
act
like
a
bug
,
like
a
venomous
*NL*
spider
,
without
a
spark
of
pity
.
I
could
scarcely
breathe
.
Understand
,
I
*NL*
should
have
gone
next
day
to
ask
for
her
hand
,
so
that
it
might
end
*NL*
honorably
,
so
to
speak
,
and
that
nobody
would
or
could
know
.
For
though
*NL*
I
'm
a
man
of
base
desires
,
I
'm
honest
.
And
at
that
very
second
some
voice
*NL*
seemed
to
whisper
in
my
ear
,
`
But
when
you
come
to-morrow
to
make
your
*NL*
proposal
,
that
girl
wo
n't
even
see
you
;
she
'll
order
her
coachman
to
kick
*NL*
you
out
of
the
yard
.
``
Publish
it
through
all
the
town
,
''
she
would
say
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
you
.
''
'
I
looked
at
the
young
lady
,
my
voice
had
not
*NL*
deceived
me
.
That
is
how
it
would
be
,
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
I
could
see
from
*NL*
her
face
now
that
I
should
be
turned
out
of
the
house
.
My
spite
was
*NL*
roused
.
I
longed
to
play
her
the
nastiest
swinish
cad
's
trick
:
to
look
at
*NL*
her
with
a
sneer
,
and
on
the
spot
where
she
stood
before
me
to
stun
her
*NL*
with
a
tone
of
voice
that
only
a
shopman
could
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Four
thousand
!
What
do
you
mean
?
I
was
joking
.
You
've
been
counting
*NL*
your
chickens
too
easily
,
madam
.
Two
hundred
,
if
you
like
,
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
.
But
four
thousand
is
not
a
sum
to
throw
away
on
such
frivolity
.
*NL*
You
've
put
yourself
out
to
no
purpose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
lost
the
game
,
of
course
.
She
'd
have
run
away
.
But
it
would
*NL*
have
been
an
infernal
revenge
.
It
would
have
been
worth
it
all
.
I
'd
have
*NL*
howled
with
regret
all
the
rest
of
my
life
,
only
to
have
played
that
*NL*
trick
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
it
has
never
happened
to
me
with
any
other
*NL*
woman
,
not
one
,
to
look
at
her
at
such
a
moment
with
hatred
.
But
,
on
my
*NL*
oath
,
I
looked
at
her
for
three
seconds
,
or
five
perhaps
,
with
fearful
*NL*
hatred
--
that
hate
which
is
only
a
hair
's
-
breadth
from
love
,
from
the
*NL*
maddest
love
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
the
window
,
put
my
forehead
against
the
frozen
pane
,
and
I
*NL*
remember
the
ice
burnt
my
forehead
like
fire
.
I
did
not
keep
her
long
,
*NL*
do
n't
be
afraid
.
I
turned
round
,
went
up
to
the
table
,
opened
the
drawer
*NL*
and
took
out
a
banknote
for
five
thousand
roubles
-LRB-
it
was
lying
in
a
*NL*
French
dictionary
-RRB-
.
Then
I
showed
it
her
in
silence
,
folded
it
,
handed
it
*NL*
to
her
,
opened
the
door
into
the
passage
,
and
,
stepping
back
,
made
her
a
*NL*
deep
bow
,
a
most
respectful
,
a
most
impressive
bow
,
believe
me
!
She
*NL*
shuddered
all
over
,
gazed
at
me
for
a
second
,
turned
horribly
pale
--
white
*NL*
as
a
sheet
,
in
fact
--
and
all
at
once
,
not
impetuously
but
softly
,
gently
,
*NL*
bowed
down
to
my
feet
--
not
a
boarding-school
curtsey
,
but
a
Russian
bow
,
*NL*
with
her
forehead
to
the
floor
.
She
jumped
up
and
ran
away
.
I
was
wearing
*NL*
my
sword
.
I
drew
it
and
nearly
stabbed
myself
with
it
on
the
spot
;
why
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
.
It
would
have
been
frightfully
stupid
,
of
course
.
I
suppose
it
*NL*
was
from
delight
.
Can
you
understand
that
one
might
kill
oneself
from
*NL*
delight
?
But
I
did
n't
stab
myself
.
I
only
kissed
my
sword
and
put
it
back
*NL*
in
the
scabbard
--
which
there
was
no
need
to
have
told
you
,
by
the
way
.
And
*NL*
I
fancy
that
in
telling
you
about
my
inner
conflict
I
have
laid
it
on
*NL*
rather
thick
to
glorify
myself
.
But
let
it
pass
,
and
to
hell
with
all
who
*NL*
pry
into
the
human
heart
!
Well
,
so
much
for
that
`
adventure
'
with
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna

So
now
Ivan
knows
of
it
,
and
you
--
no
one
else

*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
got
up
,
took
a
step
or
two
in
his
excitement
,
pulled
out
his
*NL*
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
forehead
,
then
sat
down
again
,
not
in
the
same
*NL*
place
as
before

but
on
the
opposite
side

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were

betrothed
at
once

not
for
three
months
after
that
adventure

The
next
day
I
told
myself
that
the
incident
was
closed
,
concluded
,
that
*NL*
there
would
be
no
sequel
.
It
seemed
to
me
caddish
to
make
her
an
offer
.
On
*NL*
her
side
she
gave
no
sign
of
life
for
the
six
weeks
that
she
remained
in
*NL*
the
town
;
except
,
indeed
,
for
one
action
.
The
day
after
her
visit
the
*NL*
maid-servant
slipped
round
with
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
.
I
tore
it
*NL*
open
:
it
contained
the
change
out
of
the
banknote
.
Only
four
thousand
five
*NL*
hundred
roubles
was
needed
,
but
there
was
a
discount
of
about
two
hundred
*NL*
on
changing
it
.
She
only
sent
me
about
two
hundred
and
sixty
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
exactly
,
but
not
a
note
,
not
a
word
of
explanation
.
I
searched
*NL*
the
packet
for
a
pencil
mark
--
n-nothing
!
Well
,
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
money
on
such
an
orgy
that
the
new
major
was
obliged
to
reprimand
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
lieutenant-colonel
produced
the
battalion
money
,
to
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
every
one
,
for
nobody
believed
that
he
had
the
money
*NL*
untouched
.
He
'd
no
sooner
paid
it
than
he
fell
ill
,
took
to
his
bed
,
and
,
*NL*
three
weeks
later
,
softening
of
the
brain
set
in
,
and
he
died
five
days
*NL*
afterwards

He
was
buried
with
military
honors
,
for
he
had
not
had
time
to
*NL*
receive
his
discharge

Ten
days
after
his
funeral
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
with
*NL*
her
aunt
and
sister
,
went
to
Moscow

And
,
behold
,
on
the
very
day
they
*NL*
went
away
-LRB-
I
had
n't
seen
them
,
did
n't
see
them
off
or
take
leave
-RRB-
I
*NL*
received
a
tiny
note
,
a
sheet
of
thin
blue
paper
,
and
on
it
only
one
line
*NL*
in
pencil
:
'
I
will
write
to
you

Wait

K.
'
And
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
explain
the
rest
now
,
in
two
words
.
In
Moscow
their
fortunes
changed
*NL*
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
the
unexpectedness
of
an
Arabian
*NL*
fairy-tale
.
That
general
's
widow
,
their
nearest
relation
,
suddenly
lost
*NL*
the
two
nieces
who
were
her
heiresses
and
next-of-kin
--
both
died
in
the
*NL*
same
week
of
small-pox
.
The
old
lady
,
prostrated
with
grief
,
welcomed
*NL*
Katya
as
a
daughter
,
as
her
one
hope
,
clutched
at
her
,
altered
her
will
in
*NL*
Katya
's
favor
.
But
that
concerned
the
future
.
Meanwhile
she
gave
her
,
for
*NL*
present
use
,
eighty
thousand
roubles
,
as
a
marriage
portion
,
to
do
what
*NL*
she
liked
with
.
She
was
an
hysterical
woman
.
I
saw
something
of
her
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
suddenly
I
received
by
post
four
thousand
five
hundred
roubles

I
*NL*
was
speechless
with
surprise
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
Three
days
later
came
*NL*
the
promised
letter
.
I
have
it
with
me
now
.
You
must
read
it
.
She
offers
*NL*
to
be
my
wife
,
offers
herself
to
me
.
'
I
love
you
madly
,
'
she
says
,

even
*NL*
if
you
do

love
me
,
never
mind

Be
my
husband

Do
n't
be
afraid

I
wo
n't
*NL*
hamper
you
in
any
way

I
will
be
your
chattel
.
I
will
be
the
carpet
under
*NL*
your
feet
.
I
want
to
love
you
for
ever
.
I
want
to
save
you
from
yourself

'
*NL*
Alyosha
,
I
am
not
worthy
to
repeat
those
lines
in
my
vulgar
words
and
in
*NL*
my
vulgar
tone
,
my
everlastingly
vulgar
tone
,
that
I
can
never
cure
myself
*NL*
of
.
That
letter
stabs
me
even
now
.
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
mind
--
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
mind
still
?
I
wrote
her
an
answer
at
once
,
as
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
*NL*
go
to
Moscow
.
I
wrote
to
her
with
tears
.
One
thing
I
shall
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
for
ever
.
I
referred
to
her
being
rich
and
having
a
dowry
while
I
was
only
*NL*
a
stuck-up
beggar
!
I
mentioned
money
!
I
ought
to
have
borne
it
in
silence
,
*NL*
but
it
slipped
from
my
pen
.
Then
I
wrote
at
once
to
Ivan
,
and
told
him
all
*NL*
I
could
about
it
in
a
letter
of
six
pages
,
and
sent
him
to
her
.
Why
do
you
*NL*
look
like
that
?
Why
are
you
staring
at
me
?
Yes
,
Ivan
fell
in
love
with
*NL*
her
;
he
's
in
love
with
her
still
.
I
know
that
.
I
did
a
stupid
thing
,
in
*NL*
the
world
's
opinion
;
but
perhaps
that
one
stupid
thing
may
be
the
saving
*NL*
of
us
all
now
.
Oo
!
Do
n't
you
see
what
a
lot
she
thinks
of
Ivan
,
how
she
*NL*
respects
him
?
When
she
compares
us
,
do
you
suppose
she
can
love
a
man
like
*NL*
me
,
especially
after
all
that
has
happened
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
convinced
that
she
does
love
a
man
like
you
,
and
not
a
man
like
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
loves
her
own
_
virtue
_
,
not
me
.
''
The
words
broke
involuntarily
,
and
*NL*
almost
malignantly
,
from
Dmitri
.
He
laughed
,
but
a
minute
later
his
eyes
*NL*
gleamed
,
he
flushed
crimson
and
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
,
Alyosha
,
''
he
cried
,
with
intense
and
genuine
anger
at
himself
;
*NL*
``
you
may
not
believe
me
,
but
as
God
is
holy
,
and
as
Christ
is
God
,
I
swear
*NL*
that
though
I
smiled
at
her
lofty
sentiments
just
now
,
I
know
that
I
am
a
*NL*
million
times
baser
in
soul
than
she
,
and
that
these
lofty
sentiments
of
*NL*
hers
are
as
sincere
as
a
heavenly
angel
's
.
That
's
the
tragedy
of
it
--
that
I
*NL*
know
that
for
certain
.
What
if
any
one
does
show
off
a
bit
?
Do
n't
I
do
it
*NL*
myself
?
And
yet
I
'm
sincere
,
I
'm
sincere
.
As
for
Ivan
,
I
can
understand
*NL*
how
he
must
be
cursing
nature
now
--
with
his
intellect
,
too
!
To
see
the
*NL*
preference
given
--
to
whom
,
to
what
?
To
a
monster
who
,
though
he
is
*NL*
betrothed
and
all
eyes
are
fixed
on
him
,
ca
n't
restrain
his
*NL*
debaucheries
--
and
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
betrothed
!
And
a
man
like
me
*NL*
is
preferred
,
while
he
is
rejected
.
And
why
?
Because
a
girl
wants
to
*NL*
sacrifice
her
life
and
destiny
out
of
gratitude
.
It
's
ridiculous
!
I
've
*NL*
never
said
a
word
of
this
to
Ivan
,
and
Ivan
of
course
has
never
dropped
a
*NL*
hint
of
the
sort
to
me
.
But
destiny
will
be
accomplished
,
and
the
best
man
*NL*
will
hold
his
ground
while
the
undeserving
one
will
vanish
into
his
back
-
*NL*
alley
for
ever
--
his
filthy
back-alley
,
his
beloved
back-alley
,
where
he
is
*NL*
at
home
and
where
he
will
sink
in
filth
and
stench
at
his
own
free
will
*NL*
and
with
enjoyment
.
I
've
been
talking
foolishly
.
I
've
no
words
left
.
I
use
*NL*
them
at
random
,
but
it
will
be
as
I
have
said
.
I
shall
drown
in
the
back
-
*NL*
alley
,
and
she
will
marry
Ivan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
Dmitri
,
''
Alyosha
interrupted
again
with
great
anxiety
.
``
There
's
one
*NL*
thing
you
have
n't
made
clear
yet
:
you
are
still
betrothed
all
the
same
,
*NL*
are
n't
you
?
How
can
you
break
off
the
engagement
if
she
,
your
betrothed
,
*NL*
does
n't
want
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
formally
and
solemnly
betrothed
.
It
was
all
done
on
my
arrival
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
with
great
ceremony
,
with
ikons
,
all
in
fine
style
.
The
general
's
*NL*
wife
blessed
us
,
and
--
would
you
believe
it
?
--
congratulated
Katya
.
`
You
've
*NL*
made
a
good
choice
,
'
she
said
,
'
I
see
right
through
him
.
'
And
--
would
you
*NL*
believe
it
?
--
she
did
n't
like
Ivan
,
and
hardly
greeted
him
.
I
had
a
lot
of
*NL*
talk
with
Katya
in
Moscow
.
I
told
her
about
myself
--
sincerely
,
honorably
.
*NL*
She
listened
to
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
sweet
confusion
,
*NL*
There
were
tender
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
were
proud
words
,
too
.
She
wrung
out
of
me
a
mighty
promise
*NL*
to
reform
.
I
gave
my
promise
,
and
here
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*

But

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
reason

'm
sending

because

And
,
how
could
I
tell
her
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
back-alley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Grushenka
,
then
!
''
Alyosha
exclaimed
mournfully
,
clasping
his
hands
.
*NL*
``
Can
Rakitin
really
have
told
the
truth
?
I
thought
that
you
had
just
*NL*
visited
her
,
and
that
was
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
a
betrothed
man
pay
such
visits
?
Is
such
a
thing
possible
and
with
*NL*
such
a
betrothed
,
and
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
?
Confound
it
,
I
*NL*
have
some
honor
!
As
soon
as
I
began
visiting
Grushenka
,
I
ceased
to
be
*NL*
betrothed
,
and
to
be
an
honest
man
.
I
understand
that
.
Why
do
you
look
at
*NL*
me
?
You
see
,
I
went
in
the
first
place
to
beat
her
.
I
had
heard
,
and
I
*NL*
know
for
a
fact
now
,
that
that
captain
,
father
's
agent
,
had
given
*NL*
Grushenka
an
I.O.U.
of
mine
for
her
to
sue
me
for
payment
,
so
as
to
put
an
*NL*
end
to
me
.
They
wanted
to
scare
me
.
I
went
to
beat
her
.
I
had
had
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
her
before
.
She
does
n't
strike
one
at
first
sight
.
I
knew
about
*NL*
her
old
merchant
,
who
's
lying
ill
now
,
paralyzed
;
but
he
's
leaving
her
a
*NL*
decent
little
sum
.
I
knew
,
too
,
that
she
was
fond
of
money
,
that
she
*NL*
hoarded
it
,
and
lent
it
at
a
wicked
rate
of
interest
,
that
she
's
a
*NL*
merciless
cheat
and
swindler
.
I
went
to
beat
her
,
and
I
stayed
.
The
storm
*NL*
broke
--
it
struck
me
down
like
the
plague
.
I
'm
plague-stricken
still
,
and
I
*NL*
know
that
everything
is
over
,
that
there
will
never
be
anything
more
for
*NL*
me
.
The
cycle
of
the
ages
is
accomplished
.
That
's
my
position
.
And
though
*NL*
I
'm
a
beggar
,
as
fate
would
have
it
,
I
had
three
thousand
just
then
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
I
drove
with
Grushenka
to
Mokroe
,
a
place
twenty-five
versts
from
*NL*
here
.
I
got
gypsies
there
and
champagne
and
made
all
the
peasants
there
*NL*
drunk
on
it
,
and
all
the
women
and
girls
.
I
sent
the
thousands
flying
.
In
*NL*
three
days
'
time
I
was
stripped
bare
,
but
a
hero
.
Do
you
suppose
the
hero
*NL*
had
gained
his
end
?
Not
a
sign
of
it
from
her
.
I
tell
you
that
rogue
,
*NL*
Grushenka
,
has
a
supple
curve
all
over
her
body
.
You
can
see
it
in
her
*NL*
little
foot
,
even
in
her
little
toe
.
I
saw
it
,
and
kissed
it
,
but
that
was
*NL*
all
,
I
swear
!
`
I
'll
marry
you
if
you
like
,
'
she
said
,
`
you
're
a
beggar
,
*NL*
you
know
.
Say
that
you
wo
n't
beat
me
,
and
will
let
me
do
anything
I
*NL*
choose
,
and
perhaps
I
will
marry
you
.
'
She
laughed
,
and
she
's
laughing
*NL*
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
leapt
up
with
a
sort
of
fury
.
He
seemed
all
at
once
as
though
he
*NL*
were
drunk
.
His
eyes
became
suddenly
bloodshot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
really
mean
to
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
,
if
she
will
.
And
if
she
wo
n't

I
shall
stay
all
the
same
.
I
'll
*NL*
be
the
porter
at
her
gate

Alyosha
!
''
he
cried
.
He
stopped
short
before
*NL*
him
,
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
began
shaking
him
violently
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
know
,
you
innocent
boy
,
that
this
is
all
delirium
,
senseless
delirium
,
for
*NL*
there
's
a
tragedy
here
.
Let
me
tell
you
,
Alexey
,
that
I
may
be
a
low
man
,
*NL*
with
low
and
degraded
passions
,
but
a
thief
and
a
pickpocket
Dmitri
*NL*
Karamazov
never
can
be
.
Well
,
then
;
let
me
tell
you
that
I
am
a
thief
and
*NL*
a
pickpocket
.
That
very
morning
,
just
before
I
went
to
beat
Grushenka
,
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
sent
for
me
,
and
in
strict
secrecy
-LRB-
why
I
do
n't
know
,
I
*NL*
suppose
she
had
some
reason
-RRB-
asked
me
to
go
to
the
chief
town
of
the
*NL*
province
and
to
post
three
thousand
roubles
to
Agafya
Ivanovna
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
so
that
nothing
should
be
known
of
it
in
the
town
here
.
So
I
had
that
*NL*
three
thousand
roubles
in
my
pocket
when
I
went
to
see
Grushenka
,
and
it
*NL*
was
that
money
we
spent
at
Mokroe
.
Afterwards
I
pretended
I
had
been
to
*NL*
the
town
,
but
did
not
show
her
the
post
office
receipt
.
I
said
I
had
sent
*NL*
the
money
and
would
bring
the
receipt
,
and
so
far
I
have
n't
brought
it
.
*NL*
I
've
forgotten
it
.
Now
what
do
you
think
you
're
going
to
her
to-day
to
*NL*
say
?
`
He
sends
his
compliments
,
'
and
she
'll
ask
you
,
`
What
about
the
*NL*
money
?
'
You
might
still
have
said
to
her
,
`
He
's
a
degraded
sensualist
,
and
*NL*
a
low
creature
,
with
uncontrolled
passions
.
He
did
n't
send
your
money
*NL*
then
,
but
wasted
it
,
because
,
like
a
low
brute
,
he
could
n't
control
*NL*
himself
.
'
But
still
you
might
have
added
,
`
He
is
n't
a
thief
though
.
Here
*NL*
is
your
three
thousand
;
he
sends
it
back
.
Send
it
yourself
to
Agafya
*NL*
Ivanovna
.
But
he
told
me
to
say
``
he
sends
his
compliments

''
'
But
,
as
it
*NL*
is
,
she
will
ask
,
`
But
where
is
the
money

*NL*
*NL*
``

perfectly
well

Now
,
especially

That
's
not
*NL*
all
.
I
know
something
more
.
Now
,
only
a
few
days
ago
,
perhaps
only
*NL*
yesterday
he
found
out
for
the
first
time
_
in
earnest

-LRB-
underline
_
in
*NL*
earnest
_
-RRB-
that
Grushenka
is
really
perhaps
not
joking
,
and
really
means
to
*NL*
marry
me
.
He
knows
her
nature
;
he
knows
the
cat
.
And
do
you
suppose
he
's
*NL*
going
to
give
me
money
to
help
to
bring
that
about
when
he
's
crazy
about
*NL*
her
himself
?
And
that
's
not
all
,
either
.
I
can
tell
you
more
than
that
.
I
*NL*
know
that
for
the
last
five
days
he
has
had
three
thousand
drawn
out
of
*NL*
the
bank
,
changed
into
notes
of
a
hundred
roubles
,
packed
into
a
large
*NL*
envelope
,
sealed
with
five
seals
,
and
tied
across
with
red
tape
.
You
see
*NL*
how
well
I
know
all
about
it
!
On
the
envelope
is
written
:
`
To
my
angel
,
*NL*
Grushenka
,
when
she
will
come
to
me
.
'
He
scrawled
it
himself
in
silence
*NL*
and
in
secret
,
and
no
one
knows
that
the
money
's
there
except
the
valet
,
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
whom
he
trusts
like
himself
.
So
now
he
has
been
expecting
*NL*
Grushenka
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
;
he
hopes
she
'll
come
for
the
*NL*
money
.
He
has
sent
her
word
of
it
,
and
she
has
sent
him
word
that
perhaps
*NL*
she
'll
come
.
And
if
she
does
go
to
the
old
man
,
can
I
marry
her
after
*NL*
that
?
You
understand
now
why
I
'm
here
in
secret
and
what
I
'm
on
the
watch
*NL*
for
.

For

that

Even

Chapter
VI
.
Smerdyakov
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
in
fact
find
his
father
still
at
table
.
Though
there
was
a
dining
-
*NL*
room
in
the
house
,
the
table
was
laid
as
usual
in
the
drawing-room
,
which
*NL*
was
the
largest
room
,
and
furnished
with
old-fashioned
ostentation
.
The
*NL*
furniture
was
white
and
very
old
,
upholstered
in
old
,
red
,
silky
material
.
*NL*
In
the
spaces
between
the
windows
there
were
mirrors
in
elaborate
white
*NL*
and
gilt
frames
,
of
old-fashioned
carving
.
On
the
walls
,
covered
with
*NL*
white
paper
,
which
was
torn
in
many
places
,
there
hung
two
large
*NL*
portraits
--
one
of
some
prince
who
had
been
governor
of
the
district
thirty
*NL*
years
before
,
and
the
other
of
some
bishop
,
also
long
since
dead
.
In
the
*NL*
corner
opposite
the
door
there
were
several
ikons
,
before
which
a
lamp
was
*NL*
lighted
at
nightfall
...
not
so
much
for
devotional
purposes
as
to
light
*NL*
the
room
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
used
to
go
to
bed
very
late
,
at
three
or
four
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
would
wander
about
the
room
at
night
or
sit
in
*NL*
an
arm-chair
,
thinking
.
This
had
become
a
habit
with
him
.
He
often
slept
*NL*
quite
alone
in
the
house
,
sending
his
servants
to
the
lodge
;
but
usually
*NL*
Smerdyakov
remained
,
sleeping
on
a
bench
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alyosha
came
in
,
dinner
was
over
,
but
coffee
and
preserves
had
been
*NL*
served
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
liked
sweet
things
with
brandy
after
dinner
.
*NL*
Ivan
was
also
at
table
,
sipping
coffee
.
The
servants
,
Grigory
and
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
were
standing
by
.
Both
the
gentlemen
and
the
servants
seemed
*NL*
in
singularly
good
spirits
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
roaring
with
laughter
.
*NL*
Before
he
entered
the
room
,
Alyosha
heard
the
shrill
laugh
he
knew
so
*NL*
well
,
and
could
tell
from
the
sound
of
it
that
his
father
had
only
reached
*NL*
the
good-humored
stage
,
and
was
far
from
being
completely
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
!
Here
he
is
!
''
yelled
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
highly
delighted
at
*NL*
seeing
Alyosha
.
``
Join
us
.
Sit
down
.
Coffee
is
a
lenten
dish
,
but
it
's
hot
*NL*
and
good

I
do
n't
offer
you
brandy

you
're
keeping
the
fast
.
But
would
you
*NL*
like
some
?
No
;
I
'd
better
give
you
some
of
our
famous
liqueur

Smerdyakov

*NL*
go
to
the
cupboard
,
the
second
shelf
on
the
right
.
Here
are
the
keys

sharp

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
began
refusing
the
liqueur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind

If
you
wo
n't
have
it

we
will

Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
*NL*
beaming
.
``
But

have
you
dined
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
answered
Alyosha
,
who
had
in
truth
only
eaten
a
piece
of
bread
and
*NL*
drunk
a
glass
of
kvas
in
the
Father
Superior
's
kitchen
.
``
Though
I
should
*NL*
be
pleased
to
have
some
hot
coffee

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo

boiling

It
's
capital
coffee

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Alyosha

smiling

too

*NL*
*NL*
``

Ivan

straight
in

face

laughs

*NL*
It
makes
me
laugh
all
over

I
'm
so
fond
of
him

Alyosha
,
let
me
give
you
*NL*
my
blessing
--
a
father
's
blessing

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
rose
,
but
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
already
changed
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
just
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
you
,
for
*NL*
now

Sit
still

Now
we
've
a
treat
for

in

It
'll
*NL*
make

Balaam
's
ass
has
begun
talking
to
us
here
--
and
how
he
*NL*
talks
!
How
he
talks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Balaam
's
ass
,
it
appeared
,
was
the
valet
,
Smerdyakov
.
He
was
a
young
man
*NL*
of
about
four
and
twenty
,
remarkably
unsociable
and
taciturn
.
Not
that
he
*NL*
was
shy
or
bashful
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
conceited
and
seemed
to
*NL*
despise
everybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
must
pause
to
say
a
few
words
about
him
now
.
He
was
brought
up
by
*NL*
Grigory
and
Marfa
,
but
the
boy
grew
up
``
with
no
sense
of
gratitude
,
''
as
*NL*
Grigory
expressed
it
;
he
was
an
unfriendly
boy
,
and
seemed
to
look
at
the
*NL*
world
mistrustfully
.
In
his
childhood
he
was
very
fond
of
hanging
cats
,
*NL*
and
burying
them
with
great
ceremony
.
He
used
to
dress
up
in
a
sheet
as
*NL*
though
it
were
a
surplice
,
and
sang
,
and
waved
some
object
over
the
dead
*NL*
cat
as
though
it
were
a
censer
.
All
this
he
did
on
the
sly
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
secrecy
.
Grigory
caught
him
once
at
this
diversion
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
sound
beating
.
He
shrank
into
a
corner
and
sulked
there
for
a
week
.
``
He
*NL*
does
n't
care
for
you
or
me
,
the
monster
,
''
Grigory
used
to
say
to
Marfa
,
*NL*
``
and
he
does
n't
care
for
any
one
.
Are
you
a
human
being
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
addressing
the
boy
directly
.
``
You
're
not
a
human
being
.
You
grew
from
the
*NL*
mildew
in
the
bath-house
.
-LRB-

-RRB-
That
's
what
you
are
.
''
Smerdyakov
,
it
appeared
*NL*
afterwards
,
could
never
forgive
him
those
words
.
Grigory
taught
him
to
*NL*
read
and
write
,
and
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
,
began
teaching
him
the
*NL*
Scriptures
.
But
this
teaching
came
to
nothing
.
At
the
second
or
third
*NL*
lesson
the
boy
suddenly
grinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
for
?
''
asked
Grigory
,
looking
at
him
threateningly
from
under
*NL*
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
.
God
created
light
on
the
first
day
,
and
the
sun
,
moon
,
and
*NL*
stars
on
the
fourth
day
.
Where
did
the
light
come
from
on
the
first
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
was
thunderstruck
.
The
boy
looked
sarcastically
at
his
teacher
.
*NL*
There
was
something
positively
condescending
in
his
expression
.
Grigory
*NL*
could
not
restrain
himself
.
``
I
'll
show
you
where
!
''
he
cried
,
and
gave
the
*NL*
boy
a
violent
slap
on
the
cheek
.
The
boy
took
the
slap
without
a
word
,
but
*NL*
withdrew
into
his
corner
again
for
some
days
.
A
week
later
he
had
his
*NL*
first
attack
of
the
disease
to
which
he
was
subject
all
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
life
--
epilepsy
.
When
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
heard
of
it
,
his
attitude
to
the
boy
*NL*
seemed
changed
at
once
.
Till
then
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
him
,
though
he
*NL*
never
scolded
him
,
and
always
gave
him
a
copeck
when
he
met
him
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
he
was
in
good
humor
,
he
would
send
the
boy
something
*NL*
sweet
from
his
table
.
But
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
his
illness
,
he
showed
an
*NL*
active
interest
in
him
,
sent
for
a
doctor
,
and
tried
remedies
,
but
the
*NL*
disease
turned
out
to
be
incurable
.
The
fits
occurred
,
on
an
average
,
once
*NL*
a
month
,
but
at
various
intervals
.
The
fits
varied
too
,
in
violence
:
some
*NL*
were
light
and
some
were
very
severe
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
strictly
forbade
*NL*
Grigory
to
use
corporal
punishment
to
the
boy
,
and
began
allowing
him
to
*NL*
come
upstairs
to
him
.
He
forbade
him
to
be
taught
anything
whatever
for
a
*NL*
time
,
too
.
One
day
when
the
boy
was
about
fifteen
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
noticed
him
lingering
by
the
bookcase
,
and
reading
the
titles
through
the
*NL*
glass
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
a
fair
number
of
books
--
over
a
hundred
--
but
no
*NL*
one
ever
saw
him
reading
.
He
at
once
gave
Smerdyakov
the
key
of
the
*NL*
bookcase
.
``
Come
,
read
.
You
shall
be
my
librarian
.
You
'll
be
better
sitting
*NL*
reading
than
hanging
about
the
courtyard
.
Come
,
read
this
,
''
and
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
gave
him
_
Evenings
in
a
Cottage
near
Dikanka
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
a
little
but
did
n't
like
it
.
He
did
not
once
smile
,
and
ended
by
*NL*
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Is
n't
it
funny
?
''
asked
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
,
stupid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
untrue
,
''
mumbled
the
boy
,
with
a
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
go
to
the
devil
!
You
have
the
soul
of
a
lackey
.
Stay
,
here
's
*NL*
Smaragdov
's
_
Universal
History
_
.
That
's
all
true
.
Read
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Smerdyakov
did
not
get
through
ten
pages
of
Smaragdov
.
He
thought
it
*NL*
dull
.
So
the
bookcase
was
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
afterwards
Marfa
and
Grigory
reported
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
that
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
gradually
beginning
to
show
an
extraordinary
*NL*
fastidiousness
.
He
would
sit
before
his
soup
,
take
up
his
spoon
and
look
*NL*
into
the
soup
,
bend
over
it
,
examine
it
,
take
a
spoonful
and
hold
it
to
*NL*
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
A
beetle
?
''
Grigory
would
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fly
,
perhaps
,
''
observed
Marfa
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squeamish
youth
never
answered
,
but
he
did
the
same
with
his
bread
,
*NL*
his
meat
,
and
everything
he
ate
.
He
would
hold
a
piece
on
his
fork
to
the
*NL*
light
,
scrutinize
it
microscopically
,
and
only
after
long
deliberation
*NL*
decide
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
!
What
fine
gentlemen
's
airs
!
''
Grigory
muttered
,
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
heard
of
this
development
in
Smerdyakov
he
*NL*
determined
to
make
him
his
cook
,
and
sent
him
to
Moscow
to
be
trained
.
He
*NL*
spent
some
years
there
and
came
back
remarkably
changed
in
appearance
.
He
*NL*
looked
extraordinarily
old
for
his
age
.
His
face
had
grown
wrinkled
,
*NL*
yellow
,
and
strangely
emasculate
.
In
character
he
seemed
almost
exactly
*NL*
the
same
as
before
he
went
away
.
He
was
just
as
unsociable
,
and
showed
not
*NL*
the
slightest
inclination
for
any
companionship
.
In
Moscow
,
too
,
as
we
*NL*
heard
afterwards
,
he
had
always
been
silent
.
Moscow
itself
had
little
*NL*
interest
for
him
;
he
saw
very
little
there
,
and
took
scarcely
any
notice
*NL*
of
anything
.
He
went
once
to
the
theater
,
but
returned
silent
and
*NL*
displeased
with
it
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
came
back
to
us
from
Moscow
well
*NL*
dressed
,
in
a
clean
coat
and
clean
linen
.
He
brushed
his
clothes
most
*NL*
scrupulously
twice
a
day
invariably
,
and
was
very
fond
of
cleaning
his
*NL*
smart
calf
boots
with
a
special
English
polish
,
so
that
they
shone
like
*NL*
mirrors
.
He
turned
out
a
first-rate
cook
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
paid
him
a
*NL*
salary
,
almost
the
whole
of
which
Smerdyakov
spent
on
clothes
,
pomade
,
*NL*
perfumes
,
and
such
things
.
But
he
seemed
to
have
as
much
contempt
for
the
*NL*
female
sex
as
for
men
;
he
was
discreet
,
almost
unapproachable
,
with
them
.
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
began
to
regard
him
rather
differently
.
His
fits
were
*NL*
becoming
more
frequent
,
and
on
the
days
he
was
ill
Marfa
cooked
,
which
did
*NL*
not
suit
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
your
fits
getting
worse
?
''
asked
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
looking
*NL*
askance
at
his
new
cook
.
``
Would
you
like
to
get
married
?
Shall
I
find
you
*NL*
a
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Smerdyakov
turned
pale
with
anger
,
and
made
no
reply
.
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
left
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
.
The
great
thing
was
that
he
*NL*
had
absolute
confidence
in
his
honesty
.
It
happened
once
,
when
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
was
drunk
,
that
he
dropped
in
the
muddy
courtyard
three
*NL*
hundred-rouble
notes
which
he
had
only
just
received
.
He
only
missed
them
*NL*
next
day
,
and
was
just
hastening
to
search
his
pockets
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
notes
lying
on
the
table
.
Where
had
they
come
from
?
Smerdyakov
had
picked
*NL*
them
up
and
brought
them
in
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
lad
,
I
've
never
met
any
one
like
you
,
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
said
*NL*
shortly
,
and
gave
him
ten
roubles
.
We
may
add
that
he
not
only
believed
in
*NL*
his
honesty
,
but
had
,
for
some
reason
,
a
liking
for
him
,
although
the
*NL*
young
man
looked
as
morosely
at
him
as
at
every
one
and
was
always
silent
.
*NL*
He
rarely
spoke
.
If
it
had
occurred
to
any
one
to
wonder
at
the
time
what
*NL*
the
young
man
was
interested
in
,
and
what
was
in
his
mind
,
it
would
have
*NL*
been
impossible
to
tell
by
looking
at
him
.
Yet
he
used
sometimes
to
stop
*NL*
suddenly
in
the
house
,
or
even
in
the
yard
or
street
,
and
would
stand
*NL*
still
for
ten
minutes
,
lost
in
thought
.
A
physiognomist
studying
his
face
*NL*
would
have
said
that
there
was
no
thought
in
it
,
no
reflection
,
but
only
a
*NL*
sort
of
contemplation
.
There
is
a
remarkable
picture
by
the
painter
*NL*
Kramskoy
,
called
``
Contemplation
.
''
There
is
a
forest
in
winter
,
and
on
a
*NL*
roadway
through
the
forest
,
in
absolute
solitude
,
stands
a
peasant
in
a
*NL*
torn
kaftan
and
bark
shoes
.
He
stands
,
as
it
were
,
lost
in
thought
.
Yet
he
*NL*
is
not
thinking
;
he
is
``
contemplating
.
''
If
any
one
touched
him
he
would
*NL*
start
and
look
at
one
as
though
awakening
and
bewildered
.
It
's
true
he
*NL*
would
come
to
himself
immediately
;
but
if
he
were
asked
what
he
had
been
*NL*
thinking
about
,
he
would
remember
nothing
.
Yet
probably
he
has
,
hidden
*NL*
within
himself
,
the
impression
which
had
dominated
him
during
the
period
*NL*
of
contemplation
.
Those
impressions
are
dear
to
him
and
no
doubt
he
hoards
*NL*
them
imperceptibly
,
and
even
unconsciously
.
How
and
why
,
of
course
,
he
*NL*
does
not
know
either
.
He
may
suddenly
,
after
hoarding
impressions
for
many
*NL*
years
,
abandon
everything
and
go
off
to
Jerusalem
on
a
pilgrimage
for
his
*NL*
soul
's
salvation
,
or
perhaps
he
will
suddenly
set
fire
to
his
native
*NL*
village
,
and
perhaps
do
both
.
There
are
a
good
many
``
contemplatives
''
among
*NL*
the
peasantry
.
Well
,
Smerdyakov
was
probably
one
of
them
,
and
he
probably
*NL*
was
greedily
hoarding
up
his
impressions
,
hardly
knowing
why
.

Chapter
VII
.
The
Controversy
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
Balaam
's
ass
had
suddenly
spoken
.
The
subject
was
a
strange
one
.
*NL*
Grigory
had
gone
in
the
morning
to
make
purchases
,
and
had
heard
from
the
*NL*
shopkeeper
Lukyanov
the
story
of
a
Russian
soldier
which
had
appeared
in
*NL*
the
newspaper
of
that
day
.
This
soldier
had
been
taken
prisoner
in
some
*NL*
remote
part
of
Asia
,
and
was
threatened
with
an
immediate
agonizing
death
*NL*
if
he
did
not
renounce
Christianity
and
follow
Islam
.
He
refused
to
deny
*NL*
his
faith
,
and
was
tortured
,
flayed
alive
,
and
died
,
praising
and
*NL*
glorifying
Christ
.
Grigory
had
related
the
story
at
table
.
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
always
liked
,
over
the
dessert
after
dinner
,
to
laugh
and
talk
,
*NL*
if
only
with
Grigory
.
This
afternoon
he
was
in
a
particularly
good-humored
*NL*
and
expansive
mood
.
Sipping
his
brandy
and
listening
to
the
story
,
he
*NL*
observed
that
they
ought
to
make
a
saint
of
a
soldier
like
that
,
and
to
*NL*
take
his
skin
to
some
monastery
.
``
That
would
make
the
people
flock
,
and
*NL*
bring
the
money
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
frowned
,
seeing
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
by
no
means
touched
,
*NL*
but
,
as
usual
,
was
beginning
to
scoff
.
At
that
moment
Smerdyakov
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
by
the
door
,
smiled
.
Smerdyakov
often
waited
at
table
towards
the
*NL*
end
of
dinner
,
and
since
Ivan
's
arrival
in
our
town
he
had
done
so
every
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
grinning
at
?
''
asked
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
catching
the
smile
*NL*
instantly
,
and
knowing
that
it
referred
to
Grigory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
opinion
is
,
''
Smerdyakov
began
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
in
a
*NL*
loud
voice
,
``
that
if
that
laudable
soldier
's
exploit
was
so
very
great
*NL*
there
would
have
been
,
to
my
thinking
,
no
sin
in
it
if
he
had
on
such
an
*NL*
emergency
renounced
,
so
to
speak
,
the
name
of
Christ
and
his
own
*NL*
christening
,
to
save
by
that
same
his
life
,
for
good
deeds
,
by
which
,
in
*NL*
the
course
of
years
to
expiate
his
cowardice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
it
not
be
a
sin
?
You
're
talking
nonsense
.
For
that
you
'll
go
*NL*
straight
to
hell
and
be
roasted
there
like
mutton

''
put
in
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
point
that
Alyosha
came
in
,
and
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
as
we
*NL*
have
seen
,
was
highly
delighted
at
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
on
your
subject
,
your
subject
,
''
he
chuckled
gleefully
,
making
*NL*
Alyosha
sit
down
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
mutton
,
that
's
not
so
,
and
there
'll
be
nothing

there
should
n't
be
either

if
it
's

Smerdyakov
*NL*
maintained
stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
`
according
to
justice
'
?
''
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
cried
still
*NL*
more
gayly
,
nudging
Alyosha
with
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
rascal
,
that
's
what
he
is
!
''
burst
from
Grigory
.
He
looked
*NL*
Smerdyakov
wrathfully
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
being
a
rascal
,
wait
a
little

Grigory
Vassilyevitch

''
answered
*NL*
Smerdyakov
with
perfect
composure
.
``
You
'd
better
consider
yourself
that

*NL*
once
I
am
taken
prisoner
by
the
enemies
of

Christian
race
,
and
they
*NL*
demand
from
me
to
curse
the
name
of
God
and
to
renounce
my
holy
*NL*
christening

I
am
fully
entitled

there

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
said
that
before

Do
n't

words

Prove
it

cried
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soup-maker

''
muttered
Grigory
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
being
a

too

,
without
abusing

at

I
become

it
aloud

of
saying

off

Is
that
so

Vassilyevitch

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
addressed
Grigory
with
obvious
satisfaction
,
though
he
was
really
*NL*
answering
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
questions
,
and
was
well
aware
of
it
,
and
*NL*
intentionally
pretending
that
Grigory
had
asked
the
questions

``

Fyodor

suddenly
,

at

I
become
exactly
like
a
heathen

*NL*

my

taken
off

becomes
of
no

*NL*
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Make

finish

Fyodor
Pavlovitch
urged
him
,
sipping
from

his
wine-glass
with
relish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
've
ceased
to
be
a
Christian

then
I
told
no
lie
to
the
enemy
*NL*
when
they
asked
whether
I
was
a
Christian
or
not
a
Christian
,
seeing
I
had
*NL*
already
been
relieved
by
God
Himself
of
my
Christianity
by
reason
of
the
*NL*
thought
alone
,
before
I
had
time
to
utter
a
word
to
the
enemy

And
if
I
*NL*
have
already
been
discharged
,
in
what
manner
and
with
what
sort
of
justice
*NL*
can
I
be
held
responsible
as
a
Christian
in
the
other
world
for
having
*NL*
denied
Christ
,
when
,
through
the
very
thought
alone
,
before
denying
Him
I
*NL*
had
been
relieved
from
my
christening

If
I
'm
no
longer
a
Christian

then
*NL*
I
ca
n't
renounce
Christ

I
've
nothing

Who
will
hold
*NL*
an
unclean
Tatar
responsible
,
Grigory
Vassilyevitch

even
in

for
*NL*
not
having
been
born
a

who
would
punish
him
for
that

*NL*
considering
that
you
ca

take
two
skins
off

ox

For
God
Almighty
*NL*
Himself

even
if
He
did
make
the
Tatar
responsible
,
when
he
dies
would
*NL*
give
him
the
smallest
possible
punishment

I
imagine
-LRB-
since
he
must
be
*NL*
punished
-RRB-

judging
that
he
is
not
to
blame
if
he
has
come
into
the
world
*NL*
an
unclean
heathen
,
from
heathen
parents
.
The
Lord
God
ca
n't
surely
take
a
*NL*
Tatar
and
say
he
was
a
Christian

That
would
mean
that
the
Almighty
would
*NL*
tell
a
real
untruth

And
can
the

Heaven

earth
tell
a
lie

even

in

*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
was
thunderstruck

looked
at
the
orator

his
eyes
nearly
*NL*
starting
out
of
his

Though
he
did
not
clearly
understand
what
was

said

he
had
caught
something
in
this
rigmarole
,
and
stood
,
looking
like
a
*NL*
man
who
has
just
hit
his
head
against
a
wall

Fyodor
Pavlovitch
emptied
*NL*
his
glass

went
off
into
his
shrill
laugh

*NL*

this

O

you
may
be
right

you

yourself

you
became
anathema
accursed

anathema

Smerdyakov
went
on

staid

unruffled

conscious
of
his
triumph

but
,
as
it

generous
to
the
*NL*
vanquished
foe

``
Consider
yourself
,
Grigory
Vassilyevitch

it
is
said
in
*NL*
the
Scripture
that
if
you
have
faith
,
even
as
a
mustard
seed
,
and
bid
a
*NL*
mountain
move
into
the
sea
,
it
will
move
without
the
least
delay
at
your
*NL*
bidding
.
Well
,
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
,
if
I
'm
without
faith
and
you
have
so
*NL*
great
a
faith
that
you
are
continually
swearing
at
me
,
you
try
yourself
*NL*
telling
this
mountain
,
not
to
move
into
the
sea
for
that
's
a
long
way
off
,
*NL*
but
even
to
our
stinking
little
river
which
runs
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
garden
.
You
'll
see
for
yourself
that
it
wo
n't
budge
,
but
will
remain
just
*NL*
where
it
is
however
much
you
shout
at
it
,
and
that
shows
,
Grigory
*NL*
Vassilyevitch
,
that
you
have
n't
faith
in
the
proper
manner
,
and
only
abuse
*NL*
others
about
it
.
Again
,
taking
into
consideration
that
no
one
in
our
day
,
*NL*
not
only
you
,
but
actually
no
one
,
from
the
highest
person
to
the
lowest
*NL*
peasant
,
can
shove
mountains
into
the
sea
--
except
perhaps
some
one
man
in
*NL*
the
world
,
or
,
at
most
,
two
,
and
they
most
likely
are
saving
their
souls
*NL*
in
secret
somewhere
in
the
Egyptian
desert
,
so
you
would
n't
find
them
--
if
*NL*
so
it
be
,
if
all
the
rest
have
no
faith
,
will
God
curse
all
the
rest

that
*NL*
is
,
the
population
of
the
whole
earth
,
except
about
two
hermits
in
the
*NL*
desert
,
and
in
His
well-known
mercy
will
He
not
forgive
one
of
them
?
And
*NL*
so
I
'm
persuaded
that
though
I
may
once
have
doubted
I
shall
be
forgiven
*NL*
if
I
shed
tears
of
repentance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

are
worth

piece

O

I
'll
give
it
to
you
to-day

*NL*
But
as
to
the
rest
you
talk
nonsense

nonsense

nonsense

Let
me
tell
you
,
*NL*
stupid
,
that
we
here
are
all
of
little
faith
,
only
from
carelessness
,
*NL*
because
we
have
n't
time
;
things
are
too
much
for
us
,
and
,
in
the
second
*NL*
place
,
the
Lord
God
has
given
us
so
little
time
,
only
twenty-four
hours
in
*NL*
the
day
,
so
that
one
has
n't
even
time
to
get
sleep
enough
,
much
less
to
*NL*
repent
of
one
's
sins
.
While
you
have
denied
your
faith
to
your
enemies
*NL*
when
you
'd
nothing
else
to
think
about
but
to
show
your
faith
!
So
I
*NL*
consider
,
brother
,
that
it
constitutes
a
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Constitute
a
sin
it
may
,
but
consider
yourself
,
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
,
*NL*
that
it
only
extenuates
it
,
if
it
does
constitute
.
If
I
had
believed
then
*NL*
in
very
truth
,
as
I
ought
to
have
believed
,
then
it
really
would
have
been
*NL*
sinful
if
I
had
not
faced
tortures
for
my
faith
,
and
had
gone
over
to
the
*NL*
pagan
Mohammedan
faith
.
But
,
of
course
,
it
would
n't
have
come
to
torture
*NL*
then
,
because
I
should
only
have
had
to
say
at
that
instant
to
the
*NL*
mountain
,
`
Move
and
crush
the
tormentor
,
'
and
it
would
have
moved
and
at
*NL*
the
very
instant
have
crushed
him
like
a
black-beetle
,
and
I
should
have
*NL*
walked
away
as
though
nothing
had
happened
,
praising
and
glorifying
God
.
*NL*
But
,
suppose
at
that
very
moment
I
had
tried
all
that
,
and
cried
to
that
*NL*
mountain
,
`
Crush
these
tormentors
,
'
and
it
had
n't
crushed
them
,
how
could
*NL*
I
have
helped
doubting
,
pray
,
at
such
a
time
,
and
at
such
a
dread
hour
of
*NL*
mortal
terror
?
And
apart
from
that
,
I
should
know
already
that
I
could
not
*NL*
attain
to
the
fullness
of
the
Kingdom
of
Heaven
-LRB-
for
since
the
mountain
*NL*
had
not
moved
at
my
word
,
they
could
not
think
very
much
of
my
faith
up
*NL*
aloft
,
and
there
could
be
no
very
great
reward
awaiting
me
in
the
world
to
*NL*
come
-RRB-
.
So
why
should
I
let
them
flay
the
skin
off
me
as
well
,
and
to
no
*NL*
good
purpose
?
For
,
even
though
they
had
flayed
my
skin
half
off
my
back
,
*NL*
even
then
the
mountain
would
not
have
moved
at
my
word
or
at
my
cry
.
And
*NL*
at
such
a
moment
not
only
doubt
might
come
over
one
but
one
might
lose
*NL*
one
's
reason
from
fear
,
so
that
one
would
not
be
able
to
think
at
all
.
*NL*
And
,
therefore
,
how
should
I
be
particularly
to
blame
if
not
seeing
my
*NL*
advantage
or
reward
there
or
here
,
I
should
,
at
least
,
save
my
skin
.
And
*NL*
so
trusting
fully
in
the
grace
of
the
Lord
I
should
cherish
the
hope
that
*NL*
I
might
be
altogether
forgiven

've
always
maintained

Our
peasants
are
*NL*
swindlers
,

do
n't
deserve
to
be
pitied
,
and
it
's
a
good
thing
they
're
*NL*
still
flogged
sometimes
.
Russia
is
rich
in
birches
.
If
they
destroyed

*NL*
forests

it
would
be
the
ruin
of
Russia

I
stand
up

the
clever
people

*NL*
We
've
left
off
thrashing
the
peasants

we
've
grown
so
clever

they
go
*NL*
on
thrashing
themselves

a

too

with
what

it

be
measured

it
go

Anyhow

it

measured

But
Russia
's
all
swinishness

My

I

Russia

That

not
Russia

Russia

At

told
me

nothing

as
sentencing

be

thrashed

we
always

the

thrashing
them

And
the
*NL*
girl
he
has
thrashed
to-day
,
the
young

will
ask
in

to-morrow

*NL*

it
quite
suits
the
girls

too

he
said
.
There
's
a
set
of
de
Sades
for
*NL*
you
!
But
it
's
clever

anyway

go
over
and
have
a
look
at
it

n't
*NL*
stay
to
dinner
at

Superior

tell
the

about

at

Mokroe

Alyosha

do

I
offended

then

I

But

what

It

No

's
been
my
rule
!
Can
you
understand
that
?
How
could
*NL*
you
understand
it
?
You
've
milk
in
your
veins
,
not
blood
.
You
're
not
out
of
*NL*
your
shells
yet
.
My
rule
has
been
that
you
can
always
find
something
*NL*
devilishly
interesting
in
every
woman
that
you
would
n't
find
in
any
other
.
*NL*
Only
,
one
must
know
how
to
find
it
,
that
's
the
point
!
That
's
a
talent
!
To
*NL*
my
mind
there
are
no
ugly
women
.
The
very
fact
that
she
is
a
woman
is
half
*NL*
the
battle
...
but
how
could
you
understand
that
?
Even
in
_
vieilles
*NL*
filles
_
,
even
in
them
you
may
discover
something
that
makes
you
simply
*NL*
wonder
that
men
have
been
such
fools
as
to
let
them
grow
old
without
*NL*
noticing
them
.
Bare-footed
girls
or
unattractive
ones
,
you
must
take
by
*NL*
surprise
.
Did
n't
you
know
that
?
You
must
astound
them
till
they
're
*NL*
fascinated
,
upset
,
ashamed
that
such
a
gentleman
should
fall
in
love
with
*NL*
such
a
little
slut
.
It
's
a
jolly
good
thing
that
there
always
are
and
will
*NL*
be
masters
and
slaves
in
the
world
,
so
there
always
will
be
a
little
maid
-
*NL*
of-all-work
and
her
master
,
and
you
know
,
that
's
all
that
's
needed
for
*NL*
happiness
.
Stay
...
listen
,
Alyosha
,
I
always
used
to
surprise
your
*NL*
mother
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
I
paid
no
attention
to
her
at
all
,
but
all
*NL*
at
once
,
when
the
minute
came
,
I
'd
be
all
devotion
to
her
,
crawl
on
my
*NL*
knees
,
kiss
her
feet
,
and
I
always
,
always
--
I
remember
it
as
though
it
were
*NL*
to-day
--
reduced
her
to
that
tinkling
,
quiet
,
nervous
,
queer
little
laugh
.
*NL*
It
was
peculiar
to
her
.
I
knew
her
attacks
always
used
to
begin
like
that
.
*NL*
The
next
day
she
would
begin
shrieking
hysterically
,
and
this
little
laugh
*NL*
was
not
a
sign
of
delight
,
though
it
made
a
very
good
counterfeit
.
That
's
*NL*
the
great
thing
,
to
know
how
to
take
every
one
.
Once
Belyavsky
--
he
was
a
*NL*
handsome
fellow
,
and
rich
--
used
to
like
to
come
here
and
hang
about
*NL*
her
--
suddenly
gave
me
a
slap
in
the
face
in
her
presence
.
And
she
--
such
a
*NL*
mild
sheep
--
why
,
I
thought
she
would
have
knocked
me
down
for
that
blow
.
*NL*
How
she
set
on
me
!
`
You
're
beaten
,
beaten
now
,
'
she
said
.
`
You
've
taken
a
*NL*
blow
from
him
.
You
have
been
trying
to
sell
me
to
him
,
'
she
said
...
`
And
*NL*
how
dared
he
strike
you
in
my
presence
!
Do
n't
dare
come
near
me
again
,
*NL*
never
,
never
!
Run
at
once
,
challenge
him
to
a
duel
!
'
...
I
took
her
to
the
*NL*
monastery
then
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
.
The
holy
Fathers
prayed
her
*NL*
back
to
reason
.
But
I
swear
,
by
God
,
Alyosha
,
I
never
insulted
the
poor
*NL*
crazy
girl
!
Only
once
,
perhaps
,
in
the
first
year
;
then
she
was
very
fond
*NL*
of
praying
.
She
used
to
keep
the
feasts
of
Our
Lady
particularly
and
used
*NL*
to
turn
me
out
of
her
room
then
.
I
'll
knock
that
mysticism
out
of
her
,
*NL*
thought
I
!
`
Here
,
'
said
I
,
`
you
see
your
holy
image
.
Here
it
is
.
Here
I
*NL*
take
it
down
.
You
believe
it
's
miraculous
,
but
here
,
I
'll
spit
on
it
*NL*
directly
and
nothing
will
happen
to
me
for
it
!
'
...
When
she
saw
it
,
good
*NL*
Lord
!
I
thought
she
would
kill
me
.
But
she
only
jumped
up
,
wrung
her
*NL*
hands
,
then
suddenly
hid
her
face
in
them
,
began
trembling
all
over
and
*NL*
fell
on
the
floor
...
fell
all
of
a
heap
.
Alyosha
,
Alyosha
,
what
's
the
*NL*
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
jumped
up
in
alarm
.
From
the
time
he
had
begun
speaking
about
*NL*
his
mother
,
a
change
had
gradually
come
over
Alyosha
's
face
.
He
flushed
*NL*
crimson
,
his
eyes
glowed
,
his
lips
quivered
.
The
old
sot
had
gone
*NL*
spluttering
on
,
noticing
nothing
,
till
the
moment
when
something
very
*NL*
strange
happened
to
Alyosha
.
Precisely
what
he
was
describing
in
the
crazy
*NL*
woman
was
suddenly
repeated
with
Alyosha
.
He
jumped
up
from
his
seat
*NL*
exactly
as
his
mother
was
said
to
have
done
,
wrung
his
hands
,
hid
his
face
*NL*
in
them
,
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
,
shaking
all
over
in
an
hysterical
*NL*
paroxysm
of
sudden
violent
,
silent
weeping
.
His
extraordinary
resemblance
*NL*
to
his
mother
particularly
impressed
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
,
Ivan
!
Water
,
quickly
!
It
's
like
her
,
exactly
as
she
used
to
be
*NL*
then
,
his
mother
.
Spurt
some
water
on
him
from
your
mouth
,
that
's
what
I
*NL*
used
to
do
to
her
.
He
's
upset
about
his
mother
,
his
mother
,
''
he
muttered
*NL*
to
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
was
my
mother
,
too
,
I
believe
,
his
mother
.
Was
she
not
?
''
said
*NL*
Ivan
,
with
uncontrolled
anger
and
contempt
.
The
old
man
shrank
before
his
*NL*
flashing
eyes
.
But
something
very
strange
had
happened
,
though
only
for
a
*NL*
second
;
it
seemed
really
to
have
escaped
the
old
man
's
mind
that
Alyosha
's
*NL*
mother
actually
was
the
mother
of
Ivan
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
?
''
he
muttered
,
not
understanding
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
What
*NL*
mother
are
you
talking
about
?
Was
she
?
...
Why
,
damn
it
!
of
course
she
was
*NL*
yours
too
!
Damn
it
!
My
mind
has
never
been
so
darkened
before
.
Excuse
me
,
*NL*
why
,
I
was
thinking
,
Ivan
...
He
he
he
!
''
He
stopped
.
A
broad
,
drunken
,
*NL*
half-senseless
grin
overspread
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
fearful
noise
and
clamor
was
heard
in
the
hall
,
there
*NL*
were
violent
shouts
,
the
door
was
flung
open
,
and
Dmitri
burst
into
the
*NL*
room
.
The
old
man
rushed
to
Ivan
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
kill
me
!
He
'll
kill
me
!
Do
n't
let
him
get
at
me
!
''
he
screamed
,
*NL*
clinging
to
the
skirt
of
Ivan
's
coat
.

Chapter
IX
.
The
Sensualists
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
and
Smerdyakov
ran
into
the
room
after
Dmitri
.
They
had
been
*NL*
struggling
with
him
in
the
passage
,
refusing
to
admit
him
,
acting
on
*NL*
instructions
given
them
by
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
some
days
before
.
Taking
*NL*
advantage
of
the
fact
that
Dmitri
stopped
a
moment
on
entering
the
room
to
*NL*
look
about
him
,
Grigory
ran
round
the
table
,
closed
the
double
doors
on
*NL*
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
leading
to
the
inner
apartments
,
and
stood
*NL*
before
the
closed
doors
,
stretching
wide
his
arms
,
prepared
to
defend
the
*NL*
entrance
,
so
to
speak
,
with
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
.
Seeing
this
,
*NL*
Dmitri
uttered
a
scream
rather
than
a
shout
and
rushed
at
Grigory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
's
there
!
She
's
hidden
there
!
Out
of
the
way
,
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
pull
Grigory
away
,
but
the
old
servant
pushed
him
back
.
Beside
*NL*
himself
with
fury
,
Dmitri
struck
out
,
and
hit
Grigory
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
The
old
man
fell
like
a
log
,
and
Dmitri
,
leaping
over
him
,
broke
in
the
*NL*
door
.
Smerdyakov
remained
pale
and
trembling
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
*NL*
huddling
close
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
here
!
''
shouted
Dmitri
.
``
I
saw
her
turn
towards
the
house
just
now
,
*NL*
but
I
could
n't
catch
her
.
Where
is
she
?
Where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
shout
,
``
She
's
here
!
''
produced
an
indescribable
effect
on
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
All
his
terror
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
him
!
Hold
him
!
''
he
cried
,
and
dashed
after
Dmitri
.
Meanwhile
Grigory
*NL*
had
got
up
from
the
floor
,
but
still
seemed
stunned
.
Ivan
and
Alyosha
ran
*NL*
after
their
father
.
In
the
third
room
something
was
heard
to
fall
on
the
*NL*
floor
with
a
ringing
crash
:
it
was
a
large
glass
vase
--
not
an
expensive
*NL*
one
--
on
a
marble
pedestal
which
Dmitri
had
upset
as
he
ran
past
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
him
!
''
shouted
the
old
man
.
``
Help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
and
Alyosha
caught
the
old
man
and
were
forcibly
bringing
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
run
after
him
?
He
'll
murder
you
outright
,
''
Ivan
cried
*NL*
wrathfully
at
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
!
Alyosha
!
She
must
be
here
.
Grushenka
's
here
.
He
said
he
saw
her
*NL*
himself
,
running
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
choking
.
He
was
not
expecting
Grushenka
at
the
time
,
and
the
sudden
*NL*
news
that
she
was
here
made
him
beside
himself
.
He
was
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
He
seemed
frantic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
seen
for
yourself
that
she
has
n't
come
,
''
cried
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
may
have
come
by
that
other
entrance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
entrance
is
locked
,
and
you
have
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
suddenly
reappeared
in
the
drawing-room
.
He
had
,
of
course
,
found
*NL*
the
other
entrance
locked
,
and
the
key
actually
was
in
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
pocket
.
The
windows
of
all
the
rooms
were
also
closed
,
so
Grushenka
could
*NL*
not
have
come
in
anywhere
nor
have
run
out
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
him
!
''
shrieked
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
again
.
``
He
's
*NL*
been
stealing
money
in
my
bedroom
.
''
And
tearing
himself
from
Ivan
he
*NL*
rushed
again
at
Dmitri
.
But
Dmitri
threw
up
both
hands
and
suddenly
*NL*
clutched
the
old
man
by
the
two
tufts
of
hair
that
remained
on
his
*NL*
temples
,
tugged
at
them
,
and
flung
him
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
.
He
*NL*
kicked
him
two
or
three
times
with
his
heel
in
the
face
.
The
old
man
*NL*
moaned
shrilly
.
Ivan
,
though
not
so
strong
as
Dmitri
,
threw
his
arms
round
*NL*
him
,
and
with
all
his
might
pulled
him
away
.
Alyosha
helped
him
with
his
*NL*
slender
strength
,
holding
Dmitri
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madman
!
You
've
killed
him
!
''
cried
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serve
him
right
!
''
shouted
Dmitri
breathlessly
.
``
If
I
have
n't
killed
him
,
*NL*
I
'll
come
again
and
kill
him
.
You
ca
n't
protect
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
!
Go
away
at
once
!
''
cried
Alyosha
commandingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
!
You
tell
me
.
It
's
only
you
I
can
believe
;
was
she
here
just
now

or
not
?
I
saw
her
myself
creeping
this
way
by
the
fence
from
the
lane
.
I
*NL*
shouted
,
she
ran
away
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
she
's
not
been
here

no

expected

Good-by

Not
a

to
AEsop
about
the
money
now

But
go
to
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
at
once
and
be
sure
to
say

sends
his
compliments

Compliments

his
compliments

Just
compliments

farewell

Describe
the
scene
to
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Ivan
and
Grigory
had
raised
the
old
man
and
seated
him
in
an
*NL*
arm-chair
.
His
face
was
covered
with
blood
,
but
he
was
conscious
and
*NL*
listened
greedily
to
Dmitri
's
cries
.
He
was
still
fancying
that
Grushenka
*NL*
really
was
somewhere
in
the
house
.
Dmitri
looked
at
him
with
hatred
as
he
*NL*
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
repent
shedding
your
blood
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Beware
,
old
man
,
beware
*NL*
of
your
dream
,
for
I
have
my
dream
,
too
.
I
curse
you
,
and
disown
you
*NL*
altogether

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
here
.
She
must
be
here
.
Smerdyakov
!
Smerdyakov
!
''
the
old
man
*NL*
wheezed
,
scarcely
audibly
,
beckoning
to
him
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
not
here
,
you
old
lunatic

''
Ivan
shouted
at
him
angrily
.
``
Here

*NL*
he
's
fainting
!
Water
!
A
towel
!
Make
haste
,
Smerdyakov
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
ran
for
water
.
At
last
they
got
the
old
man
undressed
,
and
put
*NL*
him
to
bed
.
They
wrapped
a
wet
towel
round
his
head
.
Exhausted
by
the
*NL*
brandy
,
by
his
violent
emotion
,
and
the
blows
he
had
received
,
he
shut
his
*NL*
eyes
and
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
.
Ivan
and
*NL*
Alyosha
went
back
to
the
drawing-room
.
Smerdyakov
removed
the
fragments
of
*NL*
the
broken
vase
,
while
Grigory
stood
by
the
table
looking
gloomily
at
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
n't
you
put
a
wet
bandage
on
your
head

go

Alyosha

said
to
him

We
'll
look
after

*NL*

Grigory
articulated
gloomily
and
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
`
insulted
'
his
father
,
not
only
you

''
observed
Ivan
with
a
forced
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
wash
him
in
his
tub

He

repeated
Grigory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
,
if
I
had
n't
pulled
him
away
perhaps
he
'd
have
murdered
him

*NL*
It
would
n't
take
much
to
do
for
AEsop

it

whispered
Ivan
to
*NL*
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
!
''
cried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
He
forbid
?
''
Ivan
went
on
in
the
same
whisper
,
with
a
malignant
*NL*
grimace
.
``
One
reptile
will
devour
the
other
.
And
serve
them
both
right
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
wo
n't
let
him
be
murdered

I
did

just
now

Stay
here

*NL*
Alyosha
,
I
'll
go
for
a
turn
in
the
yard
.
My
head
's
begun
to
ache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
to
his
father
's
bedroom
and
sat
by
his
bedside
behind
the
*NL*
screen
for
about
an
hour
.
The
old
man
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
*NL*
for
a
long
while
at
Alyosha
,
evidently
remembering
and
meditating
.
All
at
*NL*
once
his
face
betrayed
extraordinary
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
''
he
whispered
apprehensively
,
``
where
's
Ivan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
yard
.
He
's
got
a
headache
.
He
's
on
the
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
that
looking-glass
.
It
stands
over
there
.
Give
it
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
gave
him
a
little
round
folding
looking-glass
which
stood
on
the
*NL*
chest
of
drawers
.
The
old
man
looked
at
himself
in
it
;
his
nose
was
*NL*
considerably
swollen
,
and
on
the
left
side
of
his
forehead
there
was
a
*NL*
rather
large
crimson
bruise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Ivan
say
?
Alyosha
,
my
dear
,
my
only
son
,
I
'm
afraid
of
Ivan

*NL*
I
'm
more
afraid
of
Ivan
than
the
other

You
're
the
only
one
I
'm
not
afraid
*NL*
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
Ivan
either

He
is
angry
,
but
he
'll
defend
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha

and
what
of
the

He

Grushenka

the
truth

was
she
here
just
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

has
seen
her

It
was
a
mistake

She
has
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
fairly
fluttered
with
joy
,
as
though
nothing
more
comforting
*NL*
could
have
been
said
to
him
.
In
his
delight
he
seized
Alyosha
's
hand
and
*NL*
pressed
it
warmly
to
his
heart
.
Tears
positively
glittered
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
image
of
the
Mother
of
God
of
which
I
was
telling
you
just
now

he
*NL*
said
.
``

was
joking
this
morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

still
asking
whether

been

Alyosha
said
*NL*
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

no

Alyosha

embarrassed

*NL*
``
No

the
old
man
interrupted

*NL*
*NL*
Crossing
the
yard
Alyosha
found
Ivan
sitting
on
the
bench
at
the
gateway
.
*NL*
He
was
sitting
writing
something
in
pencil
in
his
note-book
.
Alyosha
told
*NL*
Ivan
that
their
father
had
waked
up
,
was
conscious
,
and
had
let
him
go
*NL*
back
to
sleep
at
the
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
I
should
be
very
glad
to
meet
you
to-morrow
morning
,
''
said
Ivan
*NL*
cordially
,
standing
up
.
His
cordiality
was
a
complete
surprise
to
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
at
the
Hohlakovs
'
to-morrow
,
''
answered
Alyosha
,
``
I
may
be
at
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
,
too
,
if
I
do
n't
find
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you

going
to
her
now

anyway

For
that
`

and
*NL*
farewell

''
said
Ivan
smiling
.
Alyosha
was
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
quite
understand
his
exclamations
just
now
,
and
part
of
what
*NL*
went
before
.
Dmitri
has
asked
you
to
go
to
her
and
say
that
he
--
well
,
in
*NL*
fact
--
takes
his
leave
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
how
will
all
this
horror
end
between
father
and
Dmitri
?
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
ca
n't
tell
for
certain
.
Perhaps
in
nothing
:
it
may
all
fizzle
out

*NL*
That
woman
is
a
beast
.
In
any
case
we
must
keep
the
old
man
indoors
and
*NL*
not
let
Dmitri
in
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
let
me
ask
one
thing
more
:
has
any
man
a
right
to
look
at
other
*NL*
men
and
decide
which
is
worthy
to
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
bring
in
the
question
of
worth
?
The
matter
is
most
often
decided
in
*NL*
men
's
hearts
on
other
grounds
much
more
natural
.
And
as
for
rights
--
who
has
*NL*
not
the
right
to
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
another
man

death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
even
if
for
another
man
's
death
?
Why
lie
to
oneself
since
all
men
*NL*
live
so
and
perhaps
can
not
help
living
so
.
Are
you
referring
to
what
I
*NL*
said
just
now
--
that
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
?
In
that
case
let
me
*NL*
ask
you
,
do
you
think
me
like
Dmitri
capable
of
shedding
AEsop
's
blood
,
*NL*
murdering
him
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
,
Ivan
?
Such
an
idea
never
crossed
my
mind
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
Dmitri
is
capable
of
it
,
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
if
only
for
that
,
''
smiled
Ivan
.
``
Be
sure
,
I
should
always
defend
*NL*
him
.
But
in
my
wishes
I
reserve
myself
full
latitude
in
this
case
.
Good-by
*NL*
till
to-morrow
.
Do
n't
condemn
me
,
and
do
n't
look
on
me
as
a
villain

''
he
*NL*
added
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
warmly
as
they
had
never
done
before
.
Alyosha
felt
that
*NL*
his
brother
had
taken
the
first
step
towards
him
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
certainly
done
this
with
some
definite
motive
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
X.
Both
Together
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
left
his
father
's
house
feeling
even
more
exhausted
and
dejected
*NL*
in
spirit
than
when
he
had
entered
it
.
His
mind
too
seemed
shattered
and
*NL*
unhinged
,
while
he
felt
that
he
was
afraid
to
put
together
the
disjointed
*NL*
fragments
and
form
a
general
idea
from
all
the
agonizing
and
conflicting
*NL*
experiences
of
the
day
.
He
felt
something
bordering
upon
despair
,
which
he
*NL*
had
never
known
till
then
.
Towering
like
a
mountain
above
all
the
rest
*NL*
stood
the
fatal
,
insoluble
question
:
How
would
things
end
between
his
*NL*
father
and
his
brother
Dmitri
with
this
terrible
woman
?
Now
he
had
himself
*NL*
been
a
witness
of
it
,
he
had
been
present
and
seen
them
face
to
face
.
Yet
*NL*
only
his
brother
Dmitri
could
be
made
unhappy
,
terribly
,
completely
*NL*
unhappy
:
there
was
trouble
awaiting
him
.
It
appeared
too
that
there
were
*NL*
other
people
concerned
,
far
more
so
than
Alyosha
could
have
supposed
*NL*
before
.
There
was
something
positively
mysterious
in
it
,
too
.
Ivan
had
*NL*
made
a
step
towards
him
,
which
was
what
Alyosha
had
been
long
desiring
.
*NL*
Yet
now
he
felt
for
some
reason
that
he
was
frightened
at
it
.
And
these
*NL*
women
?
Strange
to
say
,
that
morning
he
had
set
out
for
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
in
the
greatest
embarrassment
;
now
he
felt
nothing
of
the
kind
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
he
was
hastening
there
as
though
expecting
to
find
guidance
from
*NL*
her
.
Yet
to
give
her
this
message
was
obviously
more
difficult
than
*NL*
before
.
The
matter
of
the
three
thousand
was
decided
irrevocably
,
and
*NL*
Dmitri
,
feeling
himself
dishonored
and
losing
his
last
hope
,
might
sink
to
*NL*
any
depth
.
He
had
,
moreover
,
told
him
to
describe
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
the
*NL*
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
with
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
now
seven
o'clock
,
and
it
was
getting
dark
as
Alyosha
entered
*NL*
the
very
spacious
and
convenient
house
in
the
High
Street
occupied
by
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
Alyosha
knew
that
she
lived
with
two
aunts
.
One
of
*NL*
them
,
a
woman
of
little
education
,
was
that
aunt
of
her
half-sister
Agafya
*NL*
Ivanovna
who
had
looked
after
her
in
her
father
's
house
when
she
came
from
*NL*
boarding-school
.
The
other
aunt
was
a
Moscow
lady
of
style
and
*NL*
consequence
,
though
in
straitened
circumstances
.
It
was
said
that
they
*NL*
both
gave
way
in
everything
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
that
she
only
kept
*NL*
them
with
her
as
chaperons
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
herself
gave
way
to
no
one
*NL*
but
her
benefactress
,
the
general
's
widow
,
who
had
been
kept
by
illness
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
to
whom
she
was
obliged
to
write
twice
a
week
a
full
account
*NL*
of
all
her
doings
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alyosha
entered
the
hall
and
asked
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
to
*NL*
him
to
take
his
name
up
,
it
was
evident
that
they
were
already
aware
of
*NL*
his
arrival
.
Possibly
he
had
been
noticed
from
the
window
.
At
least
,
*NL*
Alyosha
heard
a
noise
,
caught
the
sound
of
flying
footsteps
and
rustling
*NL*
skirts
.
Two
or
three
women
,
perhaps
,
had
run
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
thought
it
strange
that
his
arrival
should
cause
such
excitement
.
*NL*
He
was
conducted
however
to
the
drawing-room
at
once
.
It
was
a
large
room
,
*NL*
elegantly
and
amply
furnished
,
not
at
all
in
provincial
style
.
There
were
*NL*
many
sofas
,
lounges
,
settees
,
big
and
little
tables
.
There
were
pictures
*NL*
on
the
walls
,
vases
and
lamps
on
the
tables
,
masses
of
flowers
,
and
even
*NL*
an
aquarium
in
the
window
.
It
was
twilight
and
rather
dark
.
Alyosha
made
*NL*
out
a
silk
mantle
thrown
down
on
the
sofa
,
where
people
had
evidently
just
*NL*
been
sitting
;
and
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
were
two
unfinished
cups
*NL*
of
chocolate
,
cakes
,
a
glass
saucer
with
blue
raisins
,
and
another
with
*NL*
sweetmeats
.
Alyosha
saw
that
he
had
interrupted
visitors
,
and
frowned
.
But
*NL*
at
that
instant
the
portiere
was
raised
,
and
with
rapid
,
hurrying
*NL*
footsteps
Katerina
Ivanovna
came
in
,
holding
out
both
hands
to
Alyosha
*NL*
with
a
radiant
smile
of
delight
.
At
the
same
instant
a
servant
brought
in
*NL*
two
lighted
candles
and
set
them
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
At
last
you
have
come
too
!
I
've
been
simply
praying
for
you
*NL*
all
day
!
Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
had
been
struck
by
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
beauty
when
,
three
weeks
*NL*
before
,
Dmitri
had
first
brought
him
,
at
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
special
*NL*
request
,
to
be
introduced
to
her
.
There
had
been
no
conversation
between
*NL*
them
at
that
interview
,
however
.
Supposing
Alyosha
to
be
very
shy
,
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
talked
all
the
time
to
Dmitri
to
spare
him
.
Alyosha
*NL*
had
been
silent
,
but
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
very
clearly
.
He
was
struck
*NL*
by
the
imperiousness
,
proud
ease
,
and
self-confidence
of
the
haughty
girl
.
*NL*
And
all
that
was
certain
,
Alyosha
felt
that
he
was
not
exaggerating
it
.
He
*NL*
thought
her
great
glowing
black
eyes
were
very
fine
,
especially
with
her
*NL*
pale
,
even
rather
sallow
,
longish
face
.
But
in
those
eyes
and
in
the
lines
*NL*
of
her
exquisite
lips
there
was
something
with
which
his
brother
might
*NL*
well
be
passionately
in
love
,
but
which
perhaps
could
not
be
loved
for
*NL*
long
.
He
expressed
this
thought
almost
plainly
to
Dmitri
when
,
after
the
*NL*
visit
,
his
brother
besought
and
insisted
that
he
should
not
conceal
his
*NL*
impressions
on
seeing
his
betrothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
happy
with
her
,
but
perhaps
--
not
tranquilly
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
brother
.
Such
people
remain
always
the
same
.
They
do
n't
yield
*NL*
to
fate
.
So
you
think
I
sha
n't
love
her
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
perhaps
you
will
love
her
for
ever
.
But
perhaps
you
wo
n't
always
be
*NL*
happy
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
had
given
his
opinion
at
the
time
,
blushing
,
and
angry
with
*NL*
himself
for
having
yielded
to
his
brother
's
entreaties
and
put
such
*NL*
``
foolish
''
ideas
into
words
.
For
his
opinion
had
struck
him
as
awfully
*NL*
foolish
immediately
after
he
had
uttered
it
.
He
felt
ashamed
too
of
having
*NL*
given
so
confident
an
opinion
about
a
woman
.
It
was
with
the
more
*NL*
amazement
that
he
felt
now
,
at
the
first
glance
at
Katerina
Ivanovna
as
*NL*
she
ran
in
to
him
,
that
he
had
perhaps
been
utterly
mistaken
.
This
time
*NL*
her
face
was
beaming
with
spontaneous
good-natured
kindliness
,
and
direct
*NL*
warm-hearted
sincerity
.
The
``
pride
and
haughtiness
,
''
which
had
struck
*NL*
Alyosha
so
much
before
,
was
only
betrayed
now
in
a
frank
,
generous
energy
*NL*
and
a
sort
of
bright
,
strong
faith
in
herself
.
Alyosha
realized
at
the
*NL*
first
glance
,
at
the
first
word
,
that
all
the
tragedy
of
her
position
in
*NL*
relation
to
the
man
she
loved
so
dearly
was
no
secret
to
her
;
that
she
*NL*
perhaps
already
knew
everything
,
positively
everything
.
And
yet
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
that
,
there
was
such
brightness
in
her
face
,
such
faith
in
the
future
.
*NL*
Alyosha
felt
at
once
that
he
had
gravely
wronged
her
in
his
thoughts
.
He
*NL*
was
conquered
and
captivated
immediately
.
Besides
all
this
,
he
noticed
at
*NL*
her
first
words
that
she
was
in
great
excitement
,
an
excitement
perhaps
*NL*
quite
exceptional
and
almost
approaching
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
eager
to
see
you
,
because
I
can
learn
from
you
the
whole
*NL*
truth
--
from
you
and
no
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
,
''
muttered
Alyosha
confusedly
,
``
I
--
he
sent
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
sent
you
!
I
foresaw
that
.
Now
I
know
everything
--
everything
!
''
cried
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
her
eyes
flashing
.
``
Wait
a
moment
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
've
been
so
longing
to
see
you
.
You
see
,
I
know
perhaps
*NL*
far
more
than
you
do
yourself
,
and
there
's
no
need
for
you
to
tell
me
*NL*
anything
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
want
from
you
.
I
want
to
know
your
own
last
*NL*
impression
of
him
.
I
want
you
to
tell
me
most
directly
,
plainly
,
coarsely
*NL*
even
-LRB-
oh
,
as
coarsely
as
you
like
!
-RRB-
,
what
you
thought
of
him
just
now
and
*NL*
of
his
position
after
your
meeting
with
him
to-day
.
That
will
perhaps
be
*NL*
better
than
if
I
had
a
personal
explanation
with
him
,
as
he
does
not
want
*NL*
to
come
to
me
.
Do
you
understand
what
I
want
from
you
?
Now
,
tell
me
*NL*
simply
,
tell
me
every
word
of
the
message
he
sent
you
with
-LRB-
I
knew
he
*NL*
would
send
you
-RRB-

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
me
to
give
you
his
compliments

and
to
say
that
he
would
never
*NL*
come
again

but
to
give
you
his
compliments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
compliments
?
Was
that
what
he
said
--
his
own
expression
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accidentally
perhaps
he
made
a
mistake
in
the
word
,
perhaps
he
did
not
*NL*
use
the
right
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
told
me
precisely
to
repeat
that
word
.
He
begged
me
two
or
three
*NL*
times
not
to
forget
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
flushed
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
me
now
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
Now
I
really
need
your
help
.
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
what
I
think
,
and
you
must
simply
say
whether
it
's
right
or
not
.
*NL*
Listen
!
If
he
had
sent
me
his
compliments
in
passing
,
without
insisting
on
*NL*
your
repeating
the
words
,
without
emphasizing
them
,
that
would
be
the
end
*NL*
of
everything
!
But
if
he
particularly
insisted
on
those
words
,
if
he
*NL*
particularly
told
you
not
to
forget
to
repeat
them
to
me
,
then
perhaps
he
*NL*
was
in
excitement
,
beside
himself
.
He
had
made
his
decision
and
was
*NL*
frightened
at
it
.
He
was
n't
walking
away
from
me
with
a
resolute
step
,
but
*NL*
leaping
headlong
.
The
emphasis
on
that
phrase
may
have
been
simply
*NL*
bravado
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
cried
Alyosha
warmly
.
``
I
believe
that
is
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
if
so
,
he
's
not
altogether
lost

I
can
still
save
him

Stay
!
Did
he
*NL*
not
tell
you
anything
about
money
--
about
three
thousand
roubles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
speak
about
it
,
and
it
's
that
more
than
anything
that
's
crushing
*NL*
him
.
He
said
he
had
lost
his
honor
and
that
nothing
matters
now
,
''
Alyosha
*NL*
answered
warmly
,
feeling
a
rush
of
hope
in
his
heart
and
believing
that
*NL*
there
really
might
be
a
way
of
escape
and
salvation
for
his
brother
.
``
But
*NL*
do
you
know
about
the
money
?
''
he
added
,
and
suddenly
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
known
of
it
a
long
time
;
I
telegraphed
to
Moscow
to
inquire
,
and
*NL*
heard
long
ago
that
the
money
had
not
arrived
.
He
had
n't
sent
the
money
,
*NL*
but
I
said
nothing
.
Last
week
I
learnt
that
he
was
still
in
need
of
money
.
*NL*
My
only
object
in
all
this
was
that
he
should
know
to
whom
to
turn
,
and
*NL*
who
was
his
true
friend
.
No
,
he
wo
n't
recognize
that
I
am
his
truest
*NL*
friend
;
he
wo
n't
know
me
,
and
looks
on
me
merely
as
a
woman
.
I
've
been
*NL*
tormented
all
the
week
,
trying
to
think
how
to
prevent
him
from
being
*NL*
ashamed
to
face
me
because
he
spent
that
three
thousand
.
Let
him
feel
*NL*
ashamed
of
himself
,
let
him
be
ashamed
of
other
people
's
knowing
,
but
not
*NL*
of
my
knowing
.
He
can
tell
God
everything
without
shame
.
Why
is
it
he
*NL*
still
does
not
understand
how
much
I
am
ready
to
bear
for
his
sake
?
Why
,
*NL*
why
does
n't
he
know
me
?
How
dare
he
not
know
me
after
all
that
has
*NL*
happened
?
I
want
to
save
him
for
ever
.
Let
him
forget
me
as
his
betrothed
.
*NL*
And
here
he
fears
that
he
is
dishonored
in
my
eyes
.
Why
,
he
was
n't
afraid
*NL*
to
be
open
with
you
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
How
is
it
that
I
do
n't
deserve
*NL*
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
she
uttered
in
tears
.
Tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
,
''
Alyosha
began
,
his
voice
trembling
too
,
``
what
happened
*NL*
just
now
between
him
and
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
described
the
whole
scene
,
how
Dmitri
had
sent
him
to
get
the
*NL*
money
,
how
he
had
broken
in
,
knocked
his
father
down
,
and
after
that
had
*NL*
again
specially
and
emphatically
begged
him
to
take
his
compliments
and
*NL*
farewell
.
``
He
went
to
that
woman
,
''
Alyosha
added
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
suppose
that
I
ca
n't
put
up
with
that
woman
?
Does
he
think
I
*NL*
ca
n't
?
But
he
wo
n't
marry
her
,
''
she
suddenly
laughed
nervously
.
``
Could
*NL*
such
a
passion
last
for
ever
in
a
Karamazov
?
It
's
passion
,
not
love
.
He
*NL*
wo
n't
marry
her
because
she
wo
n't
marry
him
.
''
Again
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
laughed
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
marry
her
,
''
said
Alyosha
mournfully
,
looking
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
marry
her
,
I
tell
you
.
That
girl
is
an
angel
.
Do
you
know
that
?
*NL*
Do
you
know
that
?
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
exclaimed
suddenly
with
extraordinary
*NL*
warmth
.
``
She
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
of
fantastic
creatures
.
I
know
*NL*
how
bewitching
she
is
,
but
I
know
too
that
she
is
kind
,
firm
and
noble
.
*NL*
Why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
?
Perhaps
you
are
*NL*
wondering
at
my
words
,
perhaps
you
do
n't
believe
me
?
Agrafena
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
my
angel
!
''
she
cried
suddenly
to
some
one
,
peeping
into
the
*NL*
next
room
,
``
come
in
to
us
.
This
is
a
friend
.
This
is
Alyosha
.
He
knows
all
*NL*
about
our
affairs
.
Show
yourself
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
only
been
waiting
behind
the
curtain
for
you
to
call
me
,
''
said
a
*NL*
soft
,
one
might
even
say
sugary
,
feminine
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
portiere
was
raised
and
Grushenka
herself
,
smiling
and
beaming
,
came
*NL*
up
to
the
table
.
A
violent
revulsion
passed
over
Alyosha
.
He
fixed
his
*NL*
eyes
on
her
and
could
not
take
them
off
.
Here
she
was
,
that
awful
woman
,
*NL*
the
``
beast
,
''
as
Ivan
had
called
her
half
an
hour
before
.
And
yet
one
would
*NL*
have
thought
the
creature
standing
before
him
most
simple
and
ordinary
,
a
*NL*
good-natured
,
kind
woman
,
handsome
certainly
,
but
so
like
other
handsome
*NL*
ordinary
women
!
It
is
true
she
was
very
,
very
good-looking
with
that
*NL*
Russian
beauty
so
passionately
loved
by
many
men
.
She
was
a
rather
tall
*NL*
woman
,
though
a
little
shorter
than
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
who
was
*NL*
exceptionally
tall
.
She
had
a
full
figure
,
with
soft
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
noiseless
,
movements
,
softened
to
a
peculiar
over-sweetness
,
like
her
*NL*
voice
.
She
moved
,
not
like
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
with
a
vigorous
,
bold
step
,
*NL*
but
noiselessly
.
Her
feet
made
absolutely
no
sound
on
the
floor
.
She
sank
*NL*
softly
into
a
low
chair
,
softly
rustling
her
sumptuous
black
silk
dress
,
*NL*
and
delicately
nestling
her
milk-white
neck
and
broad
shoulders
in
a
*NL*
costly
cashmere
shawl
.
She
was
twenty-two
years
old
,
and
her
face
looked
*NL*
exactly
that
age
.
She
was
very
white
in
the
face
,
with
a
pale
pink
tint
on
*NL*
her
cheeks
.
The
modeling
of
her
face
might
be
said
to
be
too
broad
,
and
*NL*
the
lower
jaw
was
set
a
trifle
forward
.
Her
upper
lip
was
thin
,
but
the
*NL*
slightly
prominent
lower
lip
was
at
least
twice
as
full
,
and
looked
*NL*
pouting
.
But
her
magnificent
,
abundant
dark
brown
hair
,
her
sable-colored
*NL*
eyebrows
and
charming
gray-blue
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
would
have
*NL*
made
the
most
indifferent
person
,
meeting
her
casually
in
a
crowd
in
the
*NL*
street
,
stop
at
the
sight
of
her
face
and
remember
it
long
after
.
What
*NL*
struck
Alyosha
most
in
that
face
was
its
expression
of
childlike
good
*NL*
nature
.
There
was
a
childlike
look
in
her
eyes
,
a
look
of
childish
*NL*
delight
.
She
came
up
to
the
table
,
beaming
with
delight
and
seeming
to
*NL*
expect
something
with
childish
,
impatient
,
and
confiding
curiosity
.
The
*NL*
light
in
her
eyes
gladdened
the
soul
--
Alyosha
felt
that
.
There
was
*NL*
something
else
in
her
which
he
could
not
understand
,
or
would
not
have
*NL*
been
able
to
define
,
and
which
yet
perhaps
unconsciously
affected
him
.
It
*NL*
was
that
softness
,
that
voluptuousness
of
her
bodily
movements
,
that
*NL*
catlike
noiselessness
.
Yet
it
was
a
vigorous
,
ample
body
.
Under
the
shawl
*NL*
could
be
seen
full
broad
shoulders
,
a
high
,
still
quite
girlish
bosom
.
Her
*NL*
figure
suggested
the
lines
of
the
Venus
of
Milo
,
though
already
in
*NL*
somewhat
exaggerated
proportions
.
That
could
be
divined
.
Connoisseurs
of
*NL*
Russian
beauty
could
have
foretold
with
certainty
that
this
fresh
,
still
*NL*
youthful
beauty
would
lose
its
harmony
by
the
age
of
thirty
,
would
*NL*
``
spread
''
;
that
the
face
would
become
puffy
,
and
that
wrinkles
would
very
*NL*
soon
appear
upon
her
forehead
and
round
the
eyes
;
the
complexion
would
*NL*
grow
coarse
and
red
perhaps
--
in
fact
,
that
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
moment
,
*NL*
the
fleeting
beauty
which
is
so
often
met
with
in
Russian
women
.
Alyosha
,
*NL*
of
course
,
did
not
think
of
this
;
but
though
he
was
fascinated
,
yet
he
*NL*
wondered
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
,
and
as
it
were
regretfully
,
why
she
*NL*
drawled
in
that
way
and
could
not
speak
naturally
.
She
did
so
evidently
*NL*
feeling
there
was
a
charm
in
the
exaggerated
,
honeyed
modulation
of
the
*NL*
syllables
.
It
was
,
of
course
,
only
a
bad
,
underbred
habit
that
showed
bad
*NL*
education
and
a
false
idea
of
good
manners
.
And
yet
this
intonation
and
*NL*
manner
of
speaking
impressed
Alyosha
as
almost
incredibly
incongruous
with
*NL*
the
childishly
simple
and
happy
expression
of
her
face
,
the
soft
,
babyish
*NL*
joy
in
her
eyes
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
at
once
made
her
sit
down
in
an
arm
-
*NL*
chair
facing
Alyosha
,
and
ecstatically
kissed
her
several
times
on
her
*NL*
smiling
lips
.
She
seemed
quite
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
time
we
've
met
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
''
she
said
*NL*
rapturously
.
``
I
wanted
to
know
her
,
to
see
her
.
I
wanted
to
go
to
her
,
but
*NL*
I
'd
no
sooner
expressed
the
wish
than
she
came
to
me
.
I
knew
we
should
*NL*
settle
everything
together
--
everything
.
My
heart
told
me
so
--
I
was
begged
*NL*
not
to
take
the
step
,
but
I
foresaw
it
would
be
a
way
out
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
,
and
I
was
not
mistaken
.
Grushenka
has
explained
everything
to
*NL*
me
,
told
me
all
she
means
to
do
.
She
flew
here
like
an
angel
of
goodness
*NL*
and
brought
us
peace
and
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
disdain
me
,
sweet
,
excellent
young
lady
,
''
drawled
Grushenka
*NL*
in
her
sing-song
voice
,
still
with
the
same
charming
smile
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
,
you
sorceress
,
you
witch
!
Disdain
*NL*
you
!
Here
,
I
must
kiss
your
lower
lip
once
more
.
It
looks
as
though
it
*NL*
were
swollen
,
and
now
it
will
be
more
so
,
and
more
and
more
.
Look
how
she
*NL*
laughs
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
!
It
does
one
's
heart
good
to
see
the
angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
flushed
,
and
faint
,
imperceptible
shivers
kept
running
down
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
so
much
of
me
,
dear
young
lady
,
and
perhaps
I
am
not
at
all
*NL*
worthy
of
your
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
worthy
!
She
's
not
worthy
of
it
!
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
cried
again
with
*NL*
the
same
warmth
.
``
You
know
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
we
're
fanciful
,
we
're
*NL*
self-willed
,
but
proudest
of
the
proud
in
our
little
heart
.
We
're
noble
,
*NL*
we
're
generous
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
let
me
tell
you
.
We
have
only
been
*NL*
unfortunate
.
We
were
too
ready
to
make
every
sacrifice
for
an
unworthy
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
or
fickle
man
.
There
was
one
man
--
one
,
an
officer
too
,
we
loved
*NL*
him
,
we
sacrificed
everything
to
him
.
That
was
long
ago
,
five
years
ago
,
*NL*
and
he
has
forgotten
us
,
he
has
married
.
Now
he
is
a
widower
,
he
has
*NL*
written
,
he
is
coming
here
,
and
,
do
you
know
,
we
've
loved
him
,
none
but
*NL*
him
,
all
this
time
,
and
we
've
loved
him
all
our
life
!
He
will
come
,
and
*NL*
Grushenka
will
be
happy
again
.
For
the
last
five
years
she
's
been
*NL*
wretched
.
But
who
can
reproach
her
,
who
can
boast
of
her
favor
?
Only
that
*NL*
bedridden
old
merchant
,
but
he
is
more
like
her
father
,
her
friend
,
her
*NL*
protector
.
He
found
her
then
in
despair
,
in
agony
,
deserted
by
the
man
she
*NL*
loved
.
She
was
ready
to
drown
herself
then
,
but
the
old
merchant
saved
*NL*
her
--
saved
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
defend
me
very
kindly
,
dear
young
lady
.
You
are
in
a
great
hurry
*NL*
about
everything
,
''
Grushenka
drawled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Defend
you
!
Is
it
for
me
to
defend
you
?
Should
I
dare
to
defend
you
?
*NL*
Grushenka
,
angel
,
give
me
your
hand
.
Look
at
that
charming
soft
little
*NL*
hand
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
!
Look
at
it
!
It
has
brought
me
happiness
and
has
*NL*
lifted
me
up
,
and
I
'm
going
to
kiss
it
,
outside
and
inside
,
here
,
here
,
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
three
times
she
kissed
the
certainly
charming
,
though
rather
fat
,
hand
*NL*
of
Grushenka
in
a
sort
of
rapture
.
She
held
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
*NL*
musical
,
nervous
little
laugh
,
watched
the
``
sweet
young
lady
,
''
and
*NL*
obviously
liked
having
her
hand
kissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
there
's
rather
too
much
rapture
,
''
thought
Alyosha
.
He
blushed
.
He
*NL*
felt
a
peculiar
uneasiness
at
heart
the
whole
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
make
me
blush
,
dear
young
lady
,
kissing
my
hand
like
this
*NL*
before
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
meant
to
make
you
blush
?
''
said
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
somewhat
*NL*
surprised
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
how
little
you
understand
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
you
too
perhaps
quite
misunderstand
me
,
dear
young
lady
.
Maybe
*NL*
I
'm
not
so
good
as
I
seem
to
you
.
I
've
a
bad
heart
;
I
will
have
my
own
*NL*
way
.
I
fascinated
poor
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
that
day
simply
for
fun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
you
'll
save
him
.
You
've
given
me
your
word
.
You
'll
explain
it
all
*NL*
to
him
.
You
'll
break
to
him
that
you
have
long
loved
another
man
,
who
is
*NL*
now
offering
you
his
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
I
did
n't
give
you
my
word
to
do
that
.
It
was
you
kept
talking
*NL*
about
that
.
I
did
n't
give
you
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
did
n't
quite
understand
you
,
''
said
Katerina
Ivanovna
slowly
,
*NL*
turning
a
little
pale
.
``
You
promised
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
angel
lady
,
I
've
promised
nothing
,
''
Grushenka
interrupted
softly
*NL*
and
evenly
,
still
with
the
same
gay
and
simple
expression
.
``
You
see
at
*NL*
once
,
dear
young
lady
,
what
a
willful
wretch
I
am
compared
with
you
.
If
I
*NL*
want
to
do
a
thing
I
do
it
.
I
may
have
made
you
some
promise
just
now
.
But
*NL*
now
again
I
'm
thinking
:
I
may
take
to
Mitya
again
.
I
liked
him
very
much
*NL*
once
--
liked
him
for
almost
a
whole
hour
.
Now
maybe
I
shall
go
and
tell
him
*NL*
to
stay
with
me
from
this
day
forward
.
You
see
,
I
'm
so
changeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
you
said
--
something
quite
different
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
whispered
*NL*
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
just
now
!
But
,
you
know
.
I
'm
such
a
soft-hearted
,
silly
creature
.
*NL*
Only
think
what
he
's
gone
through
on
my
account
!
What
if
when
I
go
home
I
*NL*
feel
sorry
for
him
?
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
expected
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
young
lady
,
how
good
and
generous
you
are
compared
with
me
!
Now
*NL*
perhaps
you
wo
n't
care
for
a
silly
creature
like
me
,
now
you
know
my
*NL*
character
.
Give
me
your
sweet
little
hand
,
angelic
lady
,
''
she
said
*NL*
tenderly
,
and
with
a
sort
of
reverence
took
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
dear
young
lady
,
I
'll
take
your
hand
and
kiss
it
as
you
did
mine
.
*NL*
You
kissed
mine
three
times
,
but
I
ought
to
kiss
yours
three
hundred
times
*NL*
to
be
even
with
you
.
Well
,
but
let
that
pass
.
And
then
it
shall
be
as
God
*NL*
wills
.
Perhaps
I
shall
be
your
slave
entirely
and
want
to
do
your
bidding
*NL*
like
a
slave
.
Let
it
be
as
God
wills
,
without
any
agreements
and
promises
.
*NL*
What
a
sweet
hand
--
what
a
sweet
hand
you
have
!
You
sweet
young
lady
,
you
*NL*
incredible
beauty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
slowly
raised
the
hands
to
her
lips
,
with
the
strange
object
indeed
of
*NL*
``
being
even
''
with
her
in
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
did
not
take
her
hand
away
.
She
listened
with
timid
hope
*NL*
to
the
last
words
,
though
Grushenka
's
promise
to
do
her
bidding
like
a
*NL*
slave
was
very
strangely
expressed
.
She
looked
intently
into
her
eyes
;
she
*NL*
still
saw
in
those
eyes
the
same
simple-hearted
,
confiding
expression
,
the
*NL*
same
bright
gayety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
perhaps
too
naive
,
''
thought
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
with
a
gleam
of
*NL*
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
meanwhile
seemed
enthusiastic
over
the
``
sweet
hand
.
''
She
raised
*NL*
it
deliberately
to
her
lips
.
But
she
held
it
for
two
or
three
minutes
near
*NL*
her
lips
,
as
though
reconsidering
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
angel
lady
,
''
she
suddenly
drawled
in
an
even
more
soft
and
*NL*
sugary
voice
,
``
do
you
know
,
after
all
,
I
think
I
wo
n't
kiss
your
hand
?
''
*NL*
And
she
laughed
a
little
merry
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
.
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
said
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
starting
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
you
may
be
left
to
remember
that
you
kissed
my
hand
,
but
I
did
n't
*NL*
kiss
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sudden
gleam
in
her
eyes
.
She
looked
with
awful
intentness
at
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Insolent
creature
!
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
as
though
suddenly
grasping
*NL*
something
.
She
flushed
all
over
and
leapt
up
from
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
too
got
up
,
but
without
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
shall
tell
Mitya
how
you
kissed
my
hand

I
did

how
he
will
laugh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Vile

Go
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

young

word
like
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away

You
're
a
creature
for

screamed
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
Every
*NL*
feature
was
working
in
her
utterly
distorted
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
sale
indeed

You
used

visit
gentlemen
in
the
dusk
for

once

*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
shrieked
,
and
would
have
rushed
at
her
,
but
Alyosha
held
*NL*
her
with
all
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
two
aunts
ran
in
at
her
cry
,
and
with
*NL*
them
a
maid-servant
.
All
hurried
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
away

said
Grushenka
,
taking
up
her
mantle
from
the
sofa

*NL*
``
Alyosha

home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

cried
Alyosha

clasping
his
hands
*NL*
imploringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

home

up

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
turned
away
,
wringing
his
hands
.
Grushenka
ran
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
laughing
musically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
went
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
.
She
sobbed
,
and
was
shaken
*NL*
with
convulsions
.
Every
one
fussed
round
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warned
you

said
the
elder
of
her
aunts

``
I
tried

prevent

She
could
not

herself

she
did

wanted
to

*NL*
Alyosha
walked
out
into
the
street
reeling
.
He
could
have
wept
as
she
did

*NL*
Suddenly
he
was
overtaken
by
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

took

Another

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
much
more
than
three-quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
town
to
the
*NL*
monastery
.
Alyosha
walked
quickly
along
the
road
,
at
that
hour
deserted
.
*NL*
It
was
almost
night
,
and
too
dark
to
see
anything
clearly
at
thirty
paces
*NL*
ahead
.
There
were
cross-roads
half-way
.
A
figure
came
into
sight
under
a
*NL*
solitary
willow
at
the
cross-roads
.
As
soon
as
Alyosha
reached
the
cross
-
*NL*
roads
the
figure
moved
out
and
rushed
at
him
,
shouting
savagely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
money
or
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
's
you

cried
Alyosha
,
in
surprise
,
violently
startled
*NL*
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
ha
ha
!
You
did
n't
expect
me
?
I
wondered
where
to
wait
for
you

By
her
*NL*
house
?
There
are
three
ways
from
it
,
and
I
might
have
missed
you
.
At
last
*NL*
I
thought
of
waiting
here
,
for
you
had
to
pass
here
,
there
's
no
other

Come

the

*NL*

Nothing

-LRB-
Alyosha
began
to
cry
,
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
tears
for
a
*NL*
long
time
,
and
now
something
seemed
to
snap
in
his
soul
.
-RRB-
``
You

killed

``
Stay

Look
at

You
see
what
a
dark
night

what

what
a
*NL*
wind
has
risen
.
I
hid
here
under
the
willow
waiting
for
you
.
And
as
God
's
*NL*
above
,
I
suddenly
thought
,
why
go
on
in
misery
any
longer
,
what
is
there
*NL*
to
wait
for
?
Here
I
have
a
willow

a

a

I
can
twist
*NL*
them
into
a
rope
in
a
minute

braces
besides

and
why
go
on
burdening
*NL*
the
earth
,
dishonoring
it
with
my
vile
presence

And
then
I
heard
you
*NL*
coming
--
Heavens
,
it
was
as
though
something
flew
down
to
me
suddenly

So
*NL*
there
is
a
man

then
,
whom
I
love

Here
he
is

that
man

my
dear

whom
I
love
more
than
any
one

the
only
one
I
love

in

And
I
loved
you
so
much

so
much
at
that

that
I
*NL*
thought
,
`
I
'll
fall
on
his

Then
a
stupid
idea
struck
me
,
to
*NL*
have
a
joke
with
you

scare
you

I
shouted
,
like
a
fool

`
Your

*NL*
Forgive
my
foolery

it
was
only
nonsense
,
and
there
's
nothing
unseemly
in
*NL*
my
soul
...
Damn
it
all

tell
me
what
's
happened

What
did
she
say

Strike

he
cried

``
You

Grushenka

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
described
all
that
had
happened
from
the
moment
he
went
in
to
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
.
He
was
ten
minutes
telling
his
story
.
He
ca
n't
be
*NL*
said
to
have
told
it
fluently
and
consecutively
,
but
he
seemed
to
make
it
*NL*
clear
,
not
omitting
any
word
or
action
of
significance
,
and
vividly
*NL*
describing
,
often
in
one
word
,
his
own
sensations
.
Dmitri
listened
in
*NL*
silence
,
gazing
at
him
with
a
terrible
fixed
stare
,
but
it
was
clear
to
*NL*
Alyosha
that
he
understood
it
all
,
and
had
grasped
every
point
.
But
as
the
*NL*
story
went
on
,
his
face
became
not
merely
gloomy
,
but
menacing
.
He
*NL*
scowled
,
he
clenched
his
teeth
,
and
his
fixed
stare
became
still
more
*NL*
rigid
,
more
concentrated
,
more
terrible
,
when
suddenly
,
with
incredible
*NL*
rapidity
,
his
wrathful
,
savage
face
changed
,
his
tightly
compressed
lips
*NL*
parted
,
and
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
broke
into
uncontrolled
,
spontaneous
*NL*
laughter
.
He
literally
shook
with
laughter
.
For
a
long
time
he
could
not
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
would
n't
kiss
her
hand

So
she
did
n't
kiss
it

so

ran
away

*NL*
he
kept
exclaiming
with
hysterical
delight
;
insolent
delight

might
have
*NL*
been
called
,
if
it
had
not
been
so
spontaneous

``
So
the

called

And
a

So
she
ought

be
flogged
on
a
*NL*
scaffold

Yes

yes

so
she
ought

That
's
just
what
I
think

she
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
long

It
's
like
this

her
be
punished

but
I
*NL*
must
get
better
first

I
understand
the
queen
of
impudence

That

her
all

You
saw
her
all

magnificent
in

she
ran
home

I
'll
go
--
ah

I
'll
run
to
her

*NL*
Alyosha

do
n't
blame
me

I
agree
that
hanging
is

good

*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
Alyosha
sorrowfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
her

too

I

right
through

It

*NL*
a
regular
discovery
of
the
four
continents
of
the
world
,
that
is
,
of
the
*NL*
five
!
What
a
thing
to
do
!
That
's
just
like
Katya
,
who
was
not
afraid
to
*NL*
face
a
coarse
,
unmannerly
officer
and
risk
a
deadly
insult
on
a
generous
*NL*
impulse
to
save
her
father
!
But
the
pride
,
the
recklessness
,
the
defiance
*NL*
of
fate

the
unbounded
defiance
!
You
say
that
aunt
tried
to
stop
her
?
That
*NL*
aunt
,
you
know
,
is
overbearing
,
herself

She
's
the
sister
of
the
general

*NL*
widow
in
Moscow
,
and
even
more
stuck-up
than
she

But
her
husband
was
*NL*
caught
stealing
government
money
.
He
lost
everything
,
his
estate
and
all
,
*NL*
and
the
proud
wife
had
to
lower
her
colors
,
and
has
n't
raised
them
since
.
*NL*
So
she
tried
to
prevent
Katya
,
but
she
would
n't
listen
to
her
!
She
thinks
*NL*
she
can
overcome
everything
,
that
everything
will
give
way
to
her
.
She
*NL*
thought
she
could
bewitch
Grushenka
if
she
liked
,
and
she
believed
it
*NL*
herself
:
she
plays
a
part
to
herself
,
and
whose
fault
is
it
?
Do
you
think
*NL*
she
kissed
Grushenka
's
hand
first
,
on
purpose
,
with
a
motive
?
No
,
she
*NL*
really
was
fascinated
by
Grushenka
,
that
's
to
say
,
not
by
Grushenka
,
but
*NL*
by
her
own
dream

her
own
delusion

because
it
was

her

dream

_
her
_
*NL*
delusion

how
did
you
escape
from

Dmitri
frowned
fiercely

struck
his

He
*NL*
only
now
realized
it

just
told

Katerina

sobbing

kneeling

praying

understood

down

sank
into

He
warmly
pressed
Alyosha

hand

and
still
looking
down
,
without
raising
*NL*
his
head
,
as
though
tearing
himself
away

turned
rapidly
towards

town

struck

opened

one
lost
one
's
way
and
went
astray
at
once
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
cell
he
found
the
novice
Porfiry
and
Father
Paissy
,
who
came
every
*NL*
hour
to
inquire
after
Father
Zossima
.
Alyosha
learnt
with
alarm
that
he
*NL*
was
getting
worse
and
worse
.
Even
his
usual
discourse
with
the
brothers
*NL*
could
not
take
place
that
day
.
As
a
rule
every
evening
after
service
the
*NL*
monks
flocked
into
Father
Zossima
's
cell
,
and
all
confessed
aloud
their
*NL*
sins
of
the
day
,
their
sinful
thoughts
and
temptations
;
even
their
*NL*
disputes
,
if
there
had
been
any
.
Some
confessed
kneeling
.
The
elder
*NL*
absolved
,
reconciled
,
exhorted
,
imposed
penance
,
blessed
,
and
dismissed
*NL*
them
.
It
was
against
this
general
``
confession
''
that
the
opponents
of
*NL*
``
elders
''
protested
,
maintaining
that
it
was
a
profanation
of
the
sacrament
*NL*
of
confession
,
almost
a
sacrilege
,
though
this
was
quite
a
different
*NL*
thing
.
They
even
represented
to
the
diocesan
authorities
that
such
*NL*
confessions
attained
no
good
object
,
but
actually
to
a
large
extent
led
to
*NL*
sin
and
temptation
.
Many
of
the
brothers
disliked
going
to
the
elder
,
and
*NL*
went
against
their
own
will
because
every
one
went
,
and
for
fear
they
*NL*
should
be
accused
of
pride
and
rebellious
ideas
.
People
said
that
some
of
*NL*
the
monks
agreed
beforehand
,
saying
,
``
I
'll
confess
I
lost
my
temper
with
*NL*
you
this
morning
,
and
you
confirm
it
,
''
simply
in
order
to
have
something
*NL*
to
say
.
Alyosha
knew
that
this
actually
happened
sometimes
.
He
knew
,
too
,
*NL*
that
there
were
among
the
monks
some
who
deeply
resented
the
fact
that
*NL*
letters
from
relations
were
habitually
taken
to
the
elder
,
to
be
opened
*NL*
and
read
by
him
before
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
assumed
,
of
course
,
that
all
this
was
done
freely
,
and
in
good
*NL*
faith
,
by
way
of
voluntary
submission
and
salutary
guidance
.
But
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
there
was
sometimes
no
little
insincerity
,
and
much
that
was
false
and
*NL*
strained
in
this
practice
.
Yet
the
older
and
more
experienced
of
the
monks
*NL*
adhered
to
their
opinion
,
arguing
that
``
for
those
who
have
come
within
*NL*
these
walls
sincerely
seeking
salvation
,
such
obedience
and
sacrifice
will
*NL*
certainly
be
salutary
and
of
great
benefit
;
those
,
on
the
other
hand
,
who
*NL*
find
it
irksome
,
and
repine
,
are
no
true
monks
,
and
have
made
a
mistake
in
*NL*
entering
the
monastery
--
their
proper
place
is
in
the
world
.
Even
in
the
*NL*
temple
one
can
not
be
safe
from
sin
and
the
devil
.
So
it
was
no
good
taking
*NL*
it
too
much
into
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
weaker
,
a
drowsiness
has
come
over
him
,
''
Father
Paissy
whispered
to
*NL*
Alyosha
,
as
he
blessed
him
.
``
It
's
difficult
to
rouse
him
.
And
he
must
not
*NL*
be
roused
.
He
waked
up
for
five
minutes
,
sent
his
blessing
to
the
*NL*
brothers
,
and
begged
their
prayers
for
him
at
night
.
He
intends
to
take
*NL*
the
sacrament
again
in
the
morning
.
He
remembered
you
,
Alexey
.
He
asked
*NL*
whether
you
had
gone
away
,
and
was
told
that
you
were
in
the
town
.
'
I
*NL*
blessed
him
for
that
work
,
'
he
said
,
`
his
place
is
there
,
not
here
,
for
*NL*
awhile
.
'
Those
were
his
words
about
you
.
He
remembered
you
lovingly
,
with
*NL*
anxiety
;
do
you
understand
how
he
honored
you
?
But
how
is
it
that
he
has
*NL*
decided
that
you
shall
spend
some
time
in
the
world
?
He
must
have
foreseen
*NL*
something
in
your
destiny
!
Understand
,
Alexey
,
that
if
you
return
to
the
*NL*
world
,
it
must
be
to
do
the
duty
laid
upon
you
by
your
elder
,
and
not
for
*NL*
frivolous
vanity
and
worldly
pleasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Paissy
went
out
.
Alyosha
had
no
doubt
that
Father
Zossima
was
*NL*
dying
,
though
he
might
live
another
day
or
two
.
Alyosha
firmly
and
*NL*
ardently
resolved
that
in
spite
of
his
promises
to
his
father
,
the
*NL*
Hohlakovs
,
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
he
would
not
leave
the
monastery
next
*NL*
day
,
but
would
remain
with
his
elder
to
the
end
.
His
heart
glowed
with
*NL*
love
,
and
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
having
been
able
for
one
*NL*
instant
to
forget
him
whom
he
had
left
in
the
monastery
on
his
deathbed
,
*NL*
and
whom
he
honored
above
every
one
in
the
world
.
He
went
into
Father
*NL*
Zossima
's
bedroom
,
knelt
down
,
and
bowed
to
the
ground
before
the
elder
,
*NL*
who
slept
quietly
without
stirring
,
with
regular
,
hardly
audible
breathing
*NL*
and
a
peaceful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
returned
to
the
other
room
,
where
Father
Zossima
had
received
his
*NL*
guests
in
the
morning
.
Taking
off
his
boots
,
he
lay
down
on
the
hard
,
*NL*
narrow
,
leathern
sofa
,
which
he
had
long
used
as
a
bed
,
bringing
nothing
*NL*
but
a
pillow
.
The
mattress
,
about
which
his
father
had
shouted
to
him
that
*NL*
morning
,
he
had
long
forgotten
to
lie
on
.
He
took
off
his
cassock
,
which
*NL*
he
used
as
a
covering
.
But
before
going
to
bed
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
*NL*
prayed
a
long
time
.
In
his
fervent
prayer
he
did
not
beseech
God
to
*NL*
lighten
his
darkness
but
only
thirsted
for
the
joyous
emotion
,
which
*NL*
always
visited
his
soul
after
the
praise
and
adoration
,
of
which
his
*NL*
evening
prayer
usually
consisted
.
That
joy
always
brought
him
light
*NL*
untroubled
sleep
.
As
he
was
praying
,
he
suddenly
felt
in
his
pocket
the
*NL*
little
pink
note
the
servant
had
handed
him
as
he
left
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
.
He
was
disturbed
,
but
finished
his
prayer
.
Then
,
after
some
*NL*
hesitation
,
he
opened
the
envelope
.
In
it
was
a
letter
to
him
,
signed
by
*NL*
Lise
,
the
young
daughter
of
Madame
Hohlakov
,
who
had
laughed
at
him
before
*NL*
the
elder
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Fyodorovitch

she
wrote
,
``

wrong
it
is

But
I
can
not

feeling
that
has
sprung
up
in
my
heart
,
and
this
*NL*
no

must
know

I
love

I
've
loved
you
from
my
childhood

since
our
Moscow
days

when

you
were
very
different
from
what
you
are
now
,
and
I
shall
love
you
all
my
*NL*
life

My
heart
has
chosen
you
,
to
unite
our
lives
,
and
pass
them
together
*NL*
till
our
old
age
.
Of
course
,
on
condition
that
you
will
leave
the
*NL*
monastery
.
As
for
our
age
we
will
wait
for
the
time
fixed
by
the
law
.
By
*NL*
that
time
I
shall
certainly
be
quite
strong
,
I
shall
be
walking
and
*NL*
dancing

There
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
how
I
've
thought

everything

There

only
one

:
what
you
'll
think
of
me
when
you
read
this

I
'm
always
laughing
*NL*

being
naughty

I
made
you
angry
this
morning

but
I
assure
you
before
*NL*
I
took
up
my
pen
,
I
prayed
before
the
Image

the
Mother

now
*NL*
I

almost
crying

Ah

myself
like

And
so
I

you
've
any

*NL*
Alyosha
read
the
note
in
amazement
,
read
it
through
twice
,
thought
a
*NL*
little

and
suddenly
laughed
a
soft

sweet
laugh

He
started

That
laugh
*NL*
seemed
to
him
sinful

But
a
minute
later
he
laughed
again
just
as
softly
*NL*
and
happily
.
He
slowly
replaced
the
note
in
the
envelope
,
crossed
himself
*NL*
and
lay
down
.
The
agitation
in
his
heart
passed
at
once
.
``

mercy

Chapter
I.
Father
Ferapont
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
roused
early
,
before
daybreak
.
Father
Zossima
woke
up
feeling
*NL*
very
weak
,
though
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
bed
and
sit
up
in
a
chair
.
His
*NL*
mind
was
quite
clear
;
his
face
looked
very
tired
,
yet
bright
and
almost
*NL*
joyful
.
It
wore
an
expression
of
gayety
,
kindness
and
cordiality
.
``
Maybe
I
*NL*
shall
not
live
through
the
coming
day
,
''
he
said
to
Alyosha
.
Then
he
*NL*
desired
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
at
once
.
He
always
confessed
to
*NL*
Father
Paissy
.
After
taking
the
communion
,
the
service
of
extreme
unction
*NL*
followed
.
The
monks
assembled
and
the
cell
was
gradually
filled
up
by
the
*NL*
inmates
of
the
hermitage
.
Meantime
it
was
daylight
.
People
began
coming
*NL*
from
the
monastery
.
After
the
service
was
over
the
elder
desired
to
kiss
*NL*
and
take
leave
of
every
one
.
As
the
cell
was
so
small
the
earlier
visitors
*NL*
withdrew
to
make
room
for
others
.
Alyosha
stood
beside
the
elder
,
who
was
*NL*
seated
again
in
his
arm-chair
.
He
talked
as
much
as
he
could
.
Though
his
*NL*
voice
was
weak
,
it
was
fairly
steady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
teaching
you
so
many
years
,
and
therefore
I
've
been
talking
*NL*
aloud
so
many
years
,
that
I
've
got
into
the
habit
of
talking
,
and
so
much
*NL*
so
that
it
's
almost
more
difficult
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
than
to
talk
,
*NL*
even
now
,
in
spite
of
my
weakness
,
dear
Fathers
and
brothers
,
''
he
jested
,
*NL*
looking
with
emotion
at
the
group
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
remembered
afterwards
something
of
what
he
said
to
them
.
But
*NL*
though
he
spoke
out
distinctly
and
his
voice
was
fairly
steady
,
his
speech
*NL*
was
somewhat
disconnected
.
He
spoke
of
many
things
,
he
seemed
anxious
*NL*
before
the
moment
of
death
to
say
everything
he
had
not
said
in
his
life
,
*NL*
and
not
simply
for
the
sake
of
instructing
them
,
but
as
though
thirsting
*NL*
to
share
with
all
men
and
all
creation
his
joy
and
ecstasy
,
and
once
more
*NL*
in
his
life
to
open
his
whole
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
one
another
,
Fathers
,
''
said
Father
Zossima
,
as
far
as
Alyosha
could
*NL*
remember
afterwards
.
``
Love
God
's
people
.
Because
we
have
come
here
and
*NL*
shut
ourselves
within
these
walls
,
we
are
no
holier
than
those
that
are
*NL*
outside
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
from
the
very
fact
of
coming
here
,
each
of
*NL*
us
has
confessed
to
himself
that
he
is
worse
than
others
,
than
all
men
on
*NL*
earth
...
And
the
longer
the
monk
lives
in
his
seclusion
,
the
more
keenly
*NL*
he
must
recognize
that
.
Else
he
would
have
had
no
reason
to
come
here
.
*NL*
When
he
realizes
that
he
is
not
only
worse
than
others
,
but
that
he
is
*NL*
responsible
to
all
men
for
all
and
everything
,
for
all
human
sins
,
*NL*
national
and
individual
,
only
then
the
aim
of
our
seclusion
is
attained
.
*NL*
For
know
,
dear
ones
,
that
every
one
of
us
is
undoubtedly
responsible
for
*NL*
all
men
and
everything
on
earth
,
not
merely
through
the
general
sinfulness
*NL*
of
creation
,
but
each
one
personally
for
all
mankind
and
every
individual
*NL*
man
.
This
knowledge
is
the
crown
of
life
for
the
monk
and
for
every
man
.
*NL*
For
monks
are
not
a
special
sort
of
men
,
but
only
what
all
men
ought
to
*NL*
be
.
Only
through
that
knowledge
,
our
heart
grows
soft
with
infinite
,
*NL*
universal
,
inexhaustible
love
.
Then
every
one
of
you
will
have
the
power
*NL*
to
win
over
the
whole
world
by
love
and
to
wash
away
the
sins
of
the
world
*NL*
with
your
tears
...
Each
of
you
keep
watch
over
your
heart
and
confess
*NL*
your
sins
to
yourself
unceasingly
.
Be
not
afraid
of
your
sins
,
even
when
*NL*
perceiving
them
,
if
only
there
be
penitence
,
but
make
no
conditions
with
*NL*
God
.
Again
I
say
,
Be
not
proud
.
Be
proud
neither
to
the
little
nor
to
the
*NL*
great
.
Hate
not
those
who
reject
you
,
who
insult
you
,
who
abuse
and
*NL*
slander
you
.
Hate
not
the
atheists
,
the
teachers
of
evil
,
the
*NL*
materialists
--
and
I
mean
not
only
the
good
ones
--
for
there
are
many
good
*NL*
ones
among
them
,
especially
in
our
day
--
hate
not
even
the
wicked
ones
.
*NL*
Remember
them
in
your
prayers
thus
:
Save
,
O
Lord
,
all
those
who
have
none
*NL*
to
pray
for
them
,
save
too
all
those
who
will
not
pray
.
And
add
:
it
is
not
*NL*
in
pride
that
I
make
this
prayer
,
O
Lord
,
for
I
am
lower
than
all
men
...
*NL*
Love
God
's
people
,
let
not
strangers
draw
away
the
flock
,
for
if
you
*NL*
slumber
in
your
slothfulness
and
disdainful
pride
,
or
worse
still
,
in
*NL*
covetousness
,
they
will
come
from
all
sides
and
draw
away
your
flock
.
*NL*
Expound
the
Gospel
to
the
people
unceasingly
...
be
not
extortionate
...
*NL*
Do
not
love
gold
and
silver
,
do
not
hoard
them
...
Have
faith
.
Cling
to
*NL*
the
banner
and
raise
it
on
high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
elder
spoke
more
disconnectedly
than
Alyosha
reported
his
words
*NL*
afterwards
.
Sometimes
he
broke
off
altogether
,
as
though
to
take
breath
,
*NL*
and
recover
his
strength
,
but
he
was
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
.
They
heard
him
*NL*
with
emotion
,
though
many
wondered
at
his
words
and
found
them
obscure
...
*NL*
Afterwards
all
remembered
those
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alyosha
happened
for
a
moment
to
leave
the
cell
,
he
was
struck
by
the
*NL*
general
excitement
and
suspense
in
the
monks
who
were
crowding
about
it
.
*NL*
This
anticipation
showed
itself
in
some
by
anxiety
,
in
others
by
devout
*NL*
solemnity
.
All
were
expecting
that
some
marvel
would
happen
immediately
*NL*
after
the
elder
's
death
.
Their
suspense
was
,
from
one
point
of
view
,
*NL*
almost
frivolous
,
but
even
the
most
austere
of
the
monks
were
affected
by
*NL*
it
.
Father
Paissy
's
face
looked
the
gravest
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
mysteriously
summoned
by
a
monk
to
see
Rakitin
,
who
had
*NL*
arrived
from
town
with
a
singular
letter
for
him
from
Madame
Hohlakov
.
In
*NL*
it
she
informed
Alyosha
of
a
strange
and
very
opportune
incident
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
among
the
women
who
had
come
on
the
previous
day
to
receive
*NL*
Father
Zossima
's
blessing
,
there
had
been
an
old
woman
from
the
town
,
a
*NL*
sergeant
's
widow
,
called
Prohorovna
.
She
had
inquired
whether
she
might
*NL*
pray
for
the
rest
of
the
soul
of
her
son
,
Vassenka
,
who
had
gone
to
*NL*
Irkutsk
,
and
had
sent
her
no
news
for
over
a
year
.
To
which
Father
Zossima
*NL*
had
answered
sternly
,
forbidding
her
to
do
so
,
and
saying
that
to
pray
for
*NL*
the
living
as
though
they
were
dead
was
a
kind
of
sorcery
.
He
afterwards
*NL*
forgave
her
on
account
of
her
ignorance
,
and
added
,
``
as
though
reading
the
*NL*
book
of
the
future
''
-LRB-
this
was
Madame
Hohlakov
's
expression
-RRB-
,
words
of
*NL*
comfort
:
``
that
her
son
Vassya
was
certainly
alive
and
he
would
either
come
*NL*
himself
very
shortly
or
send
a
letter
,
and
that
she
was
to
go
home
and
*NL*
expect
him
.
''
And
``
Would
you
believe
it
?
''
exclaimed
Madame
Hohlakov
*NL*
enthusiastically
,
``
the
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
literally
indeed
,
and
*NL*
more
than
that
.
''
Scarcely
had
the
old
woman
reached
home
when
they
gave
*NL*
her
a
letter
from
Siberia
which
had
been
awaiting
her
.
But
that
was
not
*NL*
all
;
in
the
letter
written
on
the
road
from
Ekaterinenburg
,
Vassya
*NL*
informed
his
mother
that
he
was
returning
to
Russia
with
an
official
,
and
*NL*
that
three
weeks
after
her
receiving
the
letter
he
hoped
``
to
embrace
his
*NL*
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
warmly
entreated
Alyosha
to
report
this
new
``
miracle
of
*NL*
prediction
''
to
the
Superior
and
all
the
brotherhood
.
``
All
,
all
,
ought
to
*NL*
know
of
it
!
''
she
concluded
.
The
letter
had
been
written
in
haste
,
the
*NL*
excitement
of
the
writer
was
apparent
in
every
line
of
it
.
But
Alyosha
had
*NL*
no
need
to
tell
the
monks
,
for
all
knew
of
it
already
.
Rakitin
had
*NL*
commissioned
the
monk
who
brought
his
message
``
to
inform
most
respectfully
*NL*
his
reverence
Father
Paissy
,
that
he
,
Rakitin
,
has
a
matter
to
speak
of
*NL*
with
him
,
of
such
gravity
that
he
dare
not
defer
it
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
humbly
begs
forgiveness
for
his
presumption
.
''
As
the
monk
had
given
the
*NL*
message
to
Father
Paissy
before
that
to
Alyosha
,
the
latter
found
after
*NL*
reading
the
letter
,
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
hand
it
to
*NL*
Father
Paissy
in
confirmation
of
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
even
that
austere
and
cautious
man
,
though
he
frowned
as
he
read
the
*NL*
news
of
the
``
miracle
,
''
could
not
completely
restrain
some
inner
emotion
.
*NL*
His
eyes
gleamed
,
and
a
grave
and
solemn
smile
came
into
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
greater
things
!
''
broke
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
greater
things
,
greater
things
yet
!
''
the
monks
around
*NL*
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Father
Paissy
,
frowning
again
,
begged
all
of
them
,
at
least
for
a
*NL*
time
,
not
to
speak
of
the
matter
``
till
it
be
more
fully
confirmed
,
seeing
*NL*
there
is
so
much
credulity
among
those
of
this
world
,
and
indeed
this
*NL*
might
well
have
chanced
naturally
,
''
he
added
,
prudently
,
as
it
were
to
*NL*
satisfy
his
conscience
,
though
scarcely
believing
his
own
disavowal
,
a
*NL*
fact
his
listeners
very
clearly
perceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
hour
the
``
miracle
''
was
of
course
known
to
the
whole
monastery
,
*NL*
and
many
visitors
who
had
come
for
the
mass
.
No
one
seemed
more
impressed
*NL*
by
it
than
the
monk
who
had
come
the
day
before
from
St.
Sylvester
,
from
*NL*
the
little
monastery
of
Obdorsk
in
the
far
North
.
It
was
he
who
had
been
*NL*
standing
near
Madame
Hohlakov
the
previous
day
and
had
asked
Father
*NL*
Zossima
earnestly
,
referring
to
the
``
healing
''
of
the
lady
's
daughter
,
``
How
*NL*
can
you
presume
to
do
such
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
now
somewhat
puzzled
and
did
not
know
whom
to
believe
.
The
evening
*NL*
before
he
had
visited
Father
Ferapont
in
his
cell
apart
,
behind
the
*NL*
apiary
,
and
had
been
greatly
impressed
and
overawed
by
the
visit
.
This
*NL*
Father
Ferapont
was
that
aged
monk
so
devout
in
fasting
and
observing
*NL*
silence
who
has
been
mentioned
already
,
as
antagonistic
to
Father
Zossima
*NL*
and
the
whole
institution
of
``
elders
,
''
which
he
regarded
as
a
pernicious
*NL*
and
frivolous
innovation
.
He
was
a
very
formidable
opponent
,
although
from
*NL*
his
practice
of
silence
he
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
any
one
.
What
made
him
*NL*
formidable
was
that
a
number
of
monks
fully
shared
his
feeling
,
and
many
*NL*
of
the
visitors
looked
upon
him
as
a
great
saint
and
ascetic
,
although
*NL*
they
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
crazy
.
But
it
was
just
his
craziness
*NL*
attracted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Ferapont
never
went
to
see
the
elder
.
Though
he
lived
in
the
*NL*
hermitage
they
did
not
worry
him
to
keep
its
regulations
,
and
this
too
*NL*
because
he
behaved
as
though
he
were
crazy
.
He
was
seventy-five
or
more
,
*NL*
and
he
lived
in
a
corner
beyond
the
apiary
in
an
old
decaying
wooden
cell
*NL*
which
had
been
built
long
ago
for
another
great
ascetic
,
Father
Iona
,
who
*NL*
had
lived
to
be
a
hundred
and
five
,
and
of
whose
saintly
doings
many
*NL*
curious
stories
were
still
extant
in
the
monastery
and
the
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Ferapont
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
installed
in
this
same
*NL*
solitary
cell
seven
years
previously
.
It
was
simply
a
peasant
's
hut
,
*NL*
though
it
looked
like
a
chapel
,
for
it
contained
an
extraordinary
number
*NL*
of
ikons
with
lamps
perpetually
burning
before
them
--
which
men
brought
to
*NL*
the
monastery
as
offerings
to
God
.
Father
Ferapont
had
been
appointed
to
*NL*
look
after
them
and
keep
the
lamps
burning
.
It
was
said
-LRB-
and
indeed
it
was
*NL*
true
-RRB-
that
he
ate
only
two
pounds
of
bread
in
three
days
.
The
beekeeper
,
*NL*
who
lived
close
by
the
apiary
,
used
to
bring
him
the
bread
every
three
*NL*
days
,
and
even
to
this
man
who
waited
upon
him
,
Father
Ferapont
rarely
*NL*
uttered
a
word
.
The
four
pounds
of
bread
,
together
with
the
sacrament
*NL*
bread
,
regularly
sent
him
on
Sundays
after
the
late
mass
by
the
Father
*NL*
Superior
,
made
up
his
weekly
rations
.
The
water
in
his
jug
was
changed
*NL*
every
day
.
He
rarely
appeared
at
mass
.
Visitors
who
came
to
do
him
homage
*NL*
saw
him
sometimes
kneeling
all
day
long
at
prayer
without
looking
round
.
*NL*
If
he
addressed
them
,
he
was
brief
,
abrupt
,
strange
,
and
almost
always
*NL*
rude
.
On
very
rare
occasions
,
however
,
he
would
talk
to
visitors
,
but
for
*NL*
the
most
part
he
would
utter
some
one
strange
saying
which
was
a
complete
*NL*
riddle
,
and
no
entreaties
would
induce
him
to
pronounce
a
word
in
*NL*
explanation
.
He
was
not
a
priest
,
but
a
simple
monk
.
There
was
a
strange
*NL*
belief
,
chiefly
however
among
the
most
ignorant
,
that
Father
Ferapont
had
*NL*
communication
with
heavenly
spirits
and
would
only
converse
with
them
,
and
*NL*
so
was
silent
with
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monk
from
Obdorsk
,
having
been
directed
to
the
apiary
by
the
*NL*
beekeeper
,
who
was
also
a
very
silent
and
surly
monk
,
went
to
the
corner
*NL*
where
Father
Ferapont
's
cell
stood
.
``
Maybe
he
will
speak
as
you
are
a
*NL*
stranger
and
maybe
you
'll
get
nothing
out
of
him
,
''
the
beekeeper
had
*NL*
warned
him
.
The
monk
,
as
he
related
afterwards
,
approached
in
the
utmost
*NL*
apprehension
.
It
was
rather
late
in
the
evening
.
Father
Ferapont
was
*NL*
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
cell
on
a
low
bench
.
A
huge
old
elm
was
lightly
*NL*
rustling
overhead
.
There
was
an
evening
freshness
in
the
air
.
The
monk
*NL*
from
Obdorsk
bowed
down
before
the
saint
and
asked
his
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
to
bow
down
to
you
,
monk
?
''
said
Father
Ferapont
.
``
Get
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
monk
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessing
,
be
blessed
!
Sit
beside
me
.
Where
have
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
most
struck
the
poor
monk
was
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
his
strict
*NL*
fasting
and
great
age
,
Father
Ferapont
still
looked
a
vigorous
old
man
.
He
*NL*
was
tall
,
held
himself
erect
,
and
had
a
thin
,
but
fresh
and
healthy
face
.
*NL*
There
was
no
doubt
he
still
had
considerable
strength
.
He
was
of
athletic
*NL*
build
.
In
spite
of
his
great
age
he
was
not
even
quite
gray
,
and
still
had
*NL*
very
thick
hair
and
a
full
beard
,
both
of
which
had
once
been
black
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
gray
,
large
and
luminous
,
but
strikingly
prominent
.
He
spoke
*NL*
with
a
broad
accent
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
peasant
's
long
reddish
coat
of
*NL*
coarse
convict
cloth
-LRB-
as
it
used
to
be
called
-RRB-
and
had
a
stout
rope
round
*NL*
his
waist
.
His
throat
and
chest
were
bare
.
Beneath
his
coat
,
his
shirt
of
*NL*
the
coarsest
linen
showed
almost
black
with
dirt
,
not
having
been
changed
*NL*
for
months
.
They
said
that
he
wore
irons
weighing
thirty
pounds
under
his
*NL*
coat
.
His
stockingless
feet
were
thrust
in
old
slippers
almost
dropping
to
*NL*
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
little
Obdorsk
monastery
,
from
St.
Sylvester
,
''
the
monk
answered
*NL*
humbly
,
whilst
his
keen
and
inquisitive
,
but
rather
frightened
little
eyes
*NL*
kept
watch
on
the
hermit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
at
your
Sylvester
's
.
I
used
to
stay
there
.
Is
Sylvester
*NL*
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
monk
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
senseless
lot
!
How
do
you
keep
the
fasts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
dietary

to
the
ancient
conventual
rules

During

is
*NL*
eaten
.
In
the
same
way
on
the
Saturday
we
have
to
fast
till
three
o'clock
,
*NL*
and
then
take
a
little
bread
and
water
and
drink
a
single
cup
of
wine
.
On
*NL*
Holy
Thursday
we
drink
wine
and
have
something
cooked
without
oil
or
not
*NL*
cooked
at
all
,
inasmuch
as
the
Laodicean
council
lays
down
for
Holy
*NL*
Thursday
:
`
It
is
unseemly
by
remitting
the
fast
on
the
Holy
Thursday
to
*NL*
dishonor
the
whole
of
Lent
!
'
This
is
how
we
keep
the
fast
.
But
what
is
*NL*
that
compared
with
you
,
holy
Father
,
''
added
the
monk
,
growing
more
*NL*
confident
,
``
for
all
the
year
round
,
even
at
Easter
,
you
take
nothing
but
*NL*
bread
and
water
,
and
what
we
should
eat
in
two
days
lasts
you
full
seven
.
*NL*
It
's
truly
marvelous
--
your
great
abstinence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mushrooms
?
''
asked
Father
Ferapont
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mushrooms
?
''
repeated
the
surprised
monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
can
give
up
their
bread
,
not
needing
it
at
all
,
and
go
away
into
*NL*
the
forest
and
live
there
on
the
mushrooms
or
the
berries
,
but
they
ca
n't
*NL*
give
up
their
bread
here
,
wherefore
they
are
in
bondage
to
the
devil
.
*NL*
Nowadays
the
unclean
deny
that
there
is
need
of
such
fasting
.
Haughty
and
*NL*
unclean
is
their
judgment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Och
,
true
,
''
sighed
the
monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
seen
devils
among
them
?
''
asked
Ferapont
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among
them
?
Among
whom
?
''
asked
the
monk
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
the
Father
Superior
on
Trinity
Sunday
last
year
,
I
have
n't
been
*NL*
since
.
I
saw
a
devil
sitting
on
one
man
's
chest
hiding
under
his
cassock
,
*NL*
only
his
horns
poked
out
;
another
had
one
peeping
out
of
his
pocket
with
*NL*
such
sharp
eyes
,
he
was
afraid
of
me
;
another
settled
in
the
unclean
belly
*NL*
of
one
,
another
was
hanging
round
a
man
's
neck
,
and
so
he
was
carrying
him
*NL*
about
without
seeing
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
can
see
spirits
?
''
the
monk
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
can
see
,
I
can
see
through
them
.
When
I
was
coming
out
from
*NL*
the
Superior
's
I
saw
one
hiding
from
me
behind
the
door
,
and
a
big
one
,
a
*NL*
yard
and
a
half
or
more
high
,
with
a
thick
long
gray
tail
,
and
the
tip
of
*NL*
his
tail
was
in
the
crack
of
the
door
and
I
was
quick
and
slammed
the
*NL*
door
,
pinching
his
tail
in
it
.
He
squealed
and
began
to
struggle
,
and
I
*NL*
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
three
times
.
And
he
died
on
the
spot
*NL*
like
a
crushed
spider
.
He
must
have
rotted
there
in
the
corner
and
be
*NL*
stinking
,
but
they
do
n't
see
,
they
do
n't
smell
it

It
's
a
year
since
I
*NL*
have
been
there

I
reveal
it
to
you
,
as
you
are
a
stranger

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
words
are
terrible
!
But
,
holy
and
blessed
Father

''
said
the
monk
,
*NL*
growing
bolder
and
bolder
,
``
is
it
true
,
as
they
noise
abroad
even
to
*NL*
distant
lands
about
you
,
that
you
are
in
continual
communication
with
the
*NL*
Holy
Ghost

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
fly
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
he
fly
down

In

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

told
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Terrible

holy

''
the
monk
shook
*NL*
his
head
.
But
there
was
a
doubtful
look
in
his
frightened
little
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
this
tree

''
asked
Father
Ferapont
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think

an
elm

but
for
me
it
has
another
shape

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
shape
?
''
inquired
the
monk
,
after
a
pause
of
vain
*NL*
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happens
at
night
.
You
see
those
two

In
the
night
it
is
*NL*
Christ
holding
out
His
arms
to
me
and
seeking
me
with
those
arms
,
I
see
it
*NL*
clearly
and
tremble
.
It
's
terrible

terrible
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
terrible
if
it
's
Christ
Himself

*NL*
*NL*
``

'll
snatch
me
up

carry
me
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alive

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
spirit
and
glory
of

n't
you
heard

will
take
me
in

His
arms

bear
me
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
monk
returned
to
the
cell
he
was
sharing
with
one
of
the
*NL*
brothers
,
in
considerable
perplexity
of
mind
,
he
still
cherished
at
heart
*NL*
a
greater
reverence
for
Father
Ferapont
than
for
Father
Zossima
.
He
was
*NL*
strongly
in
favor
of
fasting
,
and
it
was
not
strange
that
one
who
kept
so
*NL*
rigid
a
fast
as
Father
Ferapont
should
``
see
marvels
.
''
His
words
seemed
*NL*
certainly
queer
,
but
God
only
could
tell
what
was
hidden
in
those
words
,
*NL*
and
were
not
worse
words
and
acts
commonly
seen
in
those
who
have
*NL*
sacrificed
their
intellects
for
the
glory
of
God
?
The
pinching
of
the
*NL*
devil
's
tail
he
was
ready
and
eager
to
believe
,
and
not
only
in
the
*NL*
figurative
sense
.
Besides
he
had
,
before
visiting
the
monastery
,
a
strong
*NL*
prejudice
against
the
institution
of
``
elders
,
''
which
he
only
knew
of
by
*NL*
hearsay
and
believed
to
be
a
pernicious
innovation
.
Before
he
had
been
*NL*
long
at
the
monastery
,
he
had
detected
the
secret
murmurings
of
some
*NL*
shallow
brothers
who
disliked
the
institution
.
He
was
,
besides
,
a
*NL*
meddlesome
,
inquisitive
man
,
who
poked
his
nose
into
everything
.
This
was
*NL*
why
the
news
of
the
fresh
``
miracle
''
performed
by
Father
Zossima
reduced
*NL*
him
to
extreme
perplexity
.
Alyosha
remembered
afterwards
how
their
*NL*
inquisitive
guest
from
Obdorsk
had
been
continually
flitting
to
and
fro
*NL*
from
one
group
to
another
,
listening
and
asking
questions
among
the
monks
*NL*
that
were
crowding
within
and
without
the
elder
's
cell
.
But
he
did
not
pay
*NL*
much
attention
to
him
at
the
time
,
and
only
recollected
it
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
it
indeed
,
for
when
Father
Zossima
,
feeling
*NL*
tired
again
,
had
gone
back
to
bed
,
he
thought
of
Alyosha
as
he
was
closing
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
sent
for
him
.
Alyosha
ran
at
once
.
There
was
no
one
else
in
*NL*
the
cell
but
Father
Paissy
,
Father
Iosif
,
and
the
novice
Porfiry
.
The
*NL*
elder
,
opening
his
weary
eyes
and
looking
intently
at
Alyosha
,
asked
him
*NL*
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
your
people
expecting
you
,
my
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
they
need
of
you
?
Did
n't
you
promise
some
one
yesterday
to
see
*NL*
them
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
promise
--
to
my
father
--
my
brothers
--
others
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
you
must
go
.
Do
n't
grieve
.
Be
sure
I
shall
not
die
without
your
*NL*
being
by
to
hear
my
last
word
.
To
you
I
will
say
that
word
,
my
son
,
it
*NL*
will
be
my
last
gift
to
you
.
To
you
,
dear
son
,
because
you
love
me
.
But
*NL*
now
go
to
keep
your
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
immediately
obeyed
,
though
it
was
hard
to
go
.
But
the
promise
that
*NL*
he
should
hear
his
last
word
on
earth
,
that
it
should
be
the
last
gift
to
*NL*
him
,
Alyosha
,
sent
a
thrill
of
rapture
through
his
soul
.
He
made
haste
*NL*
that
he
might
finish
what
he
had
to
do
in
the
town
and
return
quickly
.
*NL*
Father
Paissy
,
too
,
uttered
some
words
of
exhortation
which
moved
and
*NL*
surprised
him
greatly
.
He
spoke
as
they
left
the
cell
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
young
man
,
unceasingly
,
''
Father
Paissy
began
,
without
preface
,
*NL*
``
that
the
science
of
this
world
,
which
has
become
a
great
power
,
has
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
last
century
,
analyzed
everything
divine
handed
down
to
*NL*
us
in
the
holy
books
.
After
this
cruel
analysis
the
learned
of
this
world
*NL*
have
nothing
left
of
all
that
was
sacred
of
old
.
But
they
have
only
*NL*
analyzed
the
parts
and
overlooked
the
whole
,
and
indeed
their
blindness
is
*NL*
marvelous
.
Yet
the
whole
still
stands
steadfast
before
their
eyes
,
and
the
*NL*
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
.
Has
it
not
lasted
nineteen
*NL*
centuries
,
is
it
not
still
a
living
,
a
moving
power
in
the
individual
soul
*NL*
and
in
the
masses
of
people
?
It
is
still
as
strong
and
living
even
in
the
*NL*
souls
of
atheists
,
who
have
destroyed
everything
!
For
even
those
who
have
*NL*
renounced
Christianity
and
attack
it
,
in
their
inmost
being
still
follow
*NL*
the
Christian
ideal
,
for
hitherto
neither
their
subtlety
nor
the
ardor
of
*NL*
their
hearts
has
been
able
to
create
a
higher
ideal
of
man
and
of
virtue
*NL*
than
the
ideal
given
by
Christ
of
old
.
When
it
has
been
attempted
,
the
*NL*
result
has
been
only
grotesque
.
Remember
this
especially
,
young
man
,
since
*NL*
you
are
being
sent
into
the
world
by
your
departing
elder
.
Maybe
,
*NL*
remembering
this
great
day
,
you
will
not
forget
my
words
,
uttered
from
the
*NL*
heart
for
your
guidance
,
seeing
you
are
young
,
and
the
temptations
of
the
*NL*
world
are
great
and
beyond
your
strength
to
endure
.
Well
,
now
go
,
my
*NL*
orphan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
Father
Paissy
blessed
him
.
As
Alyosha
left
the
monastery
*NL*
and
thought
them
over
,
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
met
a
new
and
*NL*
unexpected
friend
,
a
warmly
loving
teacher
,
in
this
austere
monk
who
had
*NL*
hitherto
treated
him
sternly
.
It
was
as
though
Father
Zossima
had
*NL*
bequeathed
him
to
him
at
his
death
,
and
``
perhaps
that
's
just
what
had
*NL*
passed
between
them
,
''
Alyosha
thought
suddenly
.
The
philosophic
*NL*
reflections
he
had
just
heard
so
unexpectedly
testified
to
the
warmth
of
*NL*
Father
Paissy
's
heart
.
He
was
in
haste
to
arm
the
boy
's
mind
for
conflict
*NL*
with
temptation
and
to
guard
the
young
soul
left
in
his
charge
with
the
*NL*
strongest
defense
he
could
imagine
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
II
.
At
His
Father
's
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
First
of
all
,
Alyosha
went
to
his
father
.
On
the
way
he
remembered
that
*NL*
his
father
had
insisted
the
day
before
that
he
should
come
without
his
*NL*
brother
Ivan
seeing
him
.
``
Why
so
?
''
Alyosha
wondered
suddenly
.
``
Even
if
my
*NL*
father
has
something
to
say
to
me
alone
,
why
should
I
go
in
unseen
?
Most
*NL*
likely
in
his
excitement
yesterday
he
meant
to
say
something
different
,
''
*NL*
he
decided
.
Yet
he
was
very
glad
when
Marfa
Ignatyevna
,
who
opened
the
*NL*
garden
gate
to
him
-LRB-
Grigory
,
it
appeared
,
was
ill
in
bed
in
the
lodge
-RRB-
,
*NL*
told
him
in
answer
to
his
question
that
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
had
gone
out
two
*NL*
hours
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
up
,
taking
his
coffee
,
''
Marfa
answered
somewhat
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
in
.
The
old
man
was
sitting
alone
at
the
table
wearing
*NL*
slippers
and
a
little
old
overcoat
.
He
was
amusing
himself
by
looking
*NL*
through
some
accounts
,
rather
inattentively
however
.
He
was
quite
alone
in
*NL*
the
house
,
for
Smerdyakov
too
had
gone
out
marketing
.
Though
he
had
got
up
*NL*
early
and
was
trying
to
put
a
bold
face
on
it
,
he
looked
tired
and
weak
.
*NL*
His
forehead
,
upon
which
huge
purple
bruises
had
come
out
during
the
*NL*
night
,
was
bandaged
with
a
red
handkerchief
;
his
nose
too
had
swollen
*NL*
terribly
in
the
night
,
and
some
smaller
bruises
covered
it
in
patches
,
*NL*
giving
his
whole
face
a
peculiarly
spiteful
and
irritable
look
.
The
old
*NL*
man
was
aware
of
this
,
and
turned
a
hostile
glance
on
Alyosha
as
he
came
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coffee
is
cold
,
''
he
cried
harshly
;
``
I
wo
n't
offer
you
any
.
I
've
*NL*
ordered
nothing
but
a
Lenten
fish
soup
to-day
,
and
I
do
n't
invite
any
one
*NL*
to
share
it
.
Why
have
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
find
out
how
you
are
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Besides
,
I
told
you
to
come
yesterday
.
It
's
all
of
no
consequence
.
*NL*
You
need
not
have
troubled
.
But
I
knew
you
'd
come
poking
in
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
with
almost
hostile
feeling
.
At
the
same
time
he
got
up
and
*NL*
looked
anxiously
in
the
looking-glass
-LRB-
perhaps
for
the
fortieth
time
that
*NL*
morning
-RRB-
at
his
nose
.
He
began
,
too
,
binding
his
red
handkerchief
more
*NL*
becomingly
on
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Red
's
better
.
It
's
just
like
the
hospital
in
a
white
one
,
''
he
observed
*NL*
sententiously
.
``
Well
,
how
are
things
over
there
?
How
is
your
elder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
bad
;
he
may
die
to-day
,
''
answered
Alyosha
.
But
his
father
had
*NL*
not
listened
,
and
had
forgotten
his
own
question
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
's
gone
out
,
''
he
said
suddenly
.
``
He
is
doing
his
utmost
to
carry
off
*NL*
Mitya
's
betrothed
.
That
's
what
he
is
staying
here
for
,
''
he
added
*NL*
maliciously
,
and
,
twisting
his
mouth
,
looked
at
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
he
did
not
tell
you
so
?
''
asked
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
did
,
long
ago
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
he
told
me
three
weeks
ago
?
*NL*
You
do
n't
suppose
he
too
came
to
murder
me
,
do
you
?
He
must
have
had
some
*NL*
object
in
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Why
do
you
say
such
things
?
''
said
Alyosha
,
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
ask
for
money
,
it
's
true
,
but
yet
he
wo
n't
get
a
farthing
from
*NL*
me
.
I
intend
living
as
long
as
possible
,
you
may
as
well
know
,
my
dear
*NL*
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
and
so
I
need
every
farthing
,
and
the
longer
I
live
,
*NL*
the
more
I
shall
need
it
,
''
he
continued
,
pacing
from
one
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
to
the
other
,
keeping
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
loose
greasy
*NL*
overcoat
made
of
yellow
cotton
material
.
``
I
can
still
pass
for
a
man
at
*NL*
five
and
fifty
,
but
I
want
to
pass
for
one
for
another
twenty
years
.
As
I
*NL*
get
older
,
you
know
,
I
sha
n't
be
a
pretty
object
.
The
wenches
wo
n't
come
*NL*
to
me
of
their
own
accord
,
so
I
shall
want
my
money
.
So
I
am
saving
up
*NL*
more
and
more
,
simply
for
myself
,
my
dear
son
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
You
may
*NL*
as
well
know
.
For
I
mean
to
go
on
in
my
sins
to
the
end
,
let
me
tell
you
.
*NL*
For
sin
is
sweet
;
all
abuse
it
,
but
all
men
live
in
it
,
only
others
do
it
*NL*
on
the
sly
,
and
I
openly
.
And
so
all
the
other
sinners
fall
upon
me
for
*NL*
being
so
simple
.
And
your
paradise
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
is
not
to
my
*NL*
taste
,
let
me
tell
you
that
;
and
it
's
not
the
proper
place
for
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
your
paradise
,
even
if
it
exists
.
I
believe
that
I
fall
asleep
*NL*
and
do
n't
wake
up
again
,
and
that
's
all
.
You
can
pray
for
my
soul
if
you
*NL*
like
.
And
if
you
do
n't
want
to
,
do
n't
,
damn
you
!
That
's
my
philosophy
.
*NL*
Ivan
talked
well
here
yesterday
,
though
we
were
all
drunk
.
Ivan
is
a
*NL*
conceited
coxcomb
,
but
he
has
no
particular
learning
...
nor
education
*NL*
either
.
He
sits
silent
and
smiles
at
one
without
speaking
--
that
's
what
*NL*
pulls
him
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
listened
to
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
wo
n't
he
talk
to
me
?
If
he
does
speak
,
he
gives
himself
airs
.
Your
*NL*
Ivan
is
a
scoundrel
!
And
I
'll
marry
Grushenka
in
a
minute
if
I
want
to
.
*NL*
For
if
you
've
money
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
you
have
only
to
want
a
thing
*NL*
and
you
can
have
it
.
That
's
what
Ivan
is
afraid
of
,
he
is
on
the
watch
to
*NL*
prevent
me
getting
married
and
that
's
why
he
is
egging
on
Mitya
to
marry
*NL*
Grushenka
himself
.
He
hopes
to
keep
me
from
Grushenka
by
that
-LRB-
as
though
I
*NL*
should
leave
him
my
money
if
I
do
n't
marry
her
!
-RRB-
.
Besides
if
Mitya
marries
*NL*
Grushenka
,
Ivan
will
carry
off
his
rich
betrothed
,
that
's
what
he
's
*NL*
reckoning
on
!
He
is
a
scoundrel

your
Ivan

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
cross
you
are
!
It
's
because
of
yesterday
;
you
had
better
lie
down
,
''
*NL*
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
you
say
that
,
''
the
old
man
observed
suddenly
,
as
though
it
had
*NL*
struck
him
for
the
first
time
,
``
and
I
am
not
angry
with
you

But
if
Ivan
*NL*
said
it
,
I
should
be
angry
with
him
.
It
is
only
with
you
I
have
good
*NL*
moments
,
else
you
know
I
am
an
ill-natured
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
ill-natured

distorted

said
Alyosha
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

I
meant
this
morning
to
get
that
ruffian
Mitya
locked
up
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
now
what
I
shall
decide
about
it

Of
course
in
these
*NL*
fashionable
days
fathers
and
mothers
are
looked
upon
as
a
prejudice
,
but
*NL*
even
now
the
law
does
not
allow
you
to
drag
your
old
father
about
by
the
*NL*
hair
,
to
kick
him
in
the
face
in
his
own
house
,
and
brag
of
murdering
him
*NL*
outright
--
all
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
.
If
I
liked
,
I
could
crush
him
*NL*
and
could
have
him
locked
up
at
once
for
what
he
did
yesterday
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't

to
take
proceedings

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
has
dissuaded
me

I
should
n't
care
about
Ivan

but
there
's
another
*NL*
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
bending
down
to
Alyosha
,
he
went
on
in
a
confidential
half-whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
send
the
ruffian
to
prison
,
she
'll
hear
of
it
and
run
to
see
him
at

once

But
if
she
hears
that
he
has
beaten
me
,
a
weak
old
man
,
within
an
*NL*
inch
of
my
life
,
she
may
give
him
up

come
to
me

For
that
's
her
*NL*
way

everything
by
contraries

I
know
her
through
and
through
!
Wo
n't
you
*NL*
have
a
drop
of
brandy

Take
some
cold
coffee
and
I
'll
pour
a
quarter

glass
of
brandy

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
'll
take

said
Alyosha

and
*NL*
taking
a
halfpenny
French
roll
he
put
it
in
the
pocket

his
cassock

suggested
apprehensively

looking
into
the
old
man

face

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
right

irritates
my
nerves
instead

soothing
them

*NL*
Only
one
little
glass

I
'll
get
it
out
of
the
cupboard

*NL*
*NL*
He
unlocked
the
cupboard
,
poured
out
a
glass
,
drank
it
,
then
locked
the
*NL*
cupboard
and
put
the
key
back
in
his
pocket

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
Alyosha

smiling

*NL*
*NL*
``
Um

I
love
you

with
scoundrels

crush
Mitya

squash
black-beetles
at

squelch

Your

*NL*
Yes

you
love
him
and
I
am
not
afraid
of
your
loving
him

But
if
Ivan
*NL*
loved
him
I
should
be
afraid
for
myself
at
his
loving
him

But
Ivan
loves
*NL*
nobody

Ivan

People

They
are
like

cloud
of

When

wind
blows

gone

I
had
a
silly
idea
in

head
when
I
told
you
to
come
to-day

I
*NL*
wanted
to
find
out
from

If

him
over
a

thousand

maybe
two

would
the

wretch
agree
to
take
himself

off
altogether
for
five

better
still

thirty-five

kissed

on

What

Chapter

A
Meeting
With
The
Schoolboys
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
goodness
he
did
not
ask
me
about
Grushenka
,
''
thought
Alyosha
,
as
he
*NL*
left
his
father
's
house
and
turned
towards
Madame
Hohlakov
's
,
``
or
I
might
*NL*
have
to
tell
him
of
my
meeting
with
Grushenka
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
felt
painfully
that
since
yesterday
both
combatants
had
renewed
*NL*
their
energies
,
and
that
their
hearts
had
grown
hard
again
.
``
Father
is
*NL*
spiteful
and
angry
,
he
's
made
some
plan
and
will
stick
to
it
.
And
what
of
*NL*
Dmitri
?
He
too
will
be
harder
than
yesterday
,
he
too
must
be
spiteful
and
*NL*
angry
,
and
he
too
,
no
doubt
,
has
made
some
plan
.
Oh
,
I
must
succeed
in
*NL*
finding
him
to-day
,
whatever
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Alyosha
had
not
long
to
meditate
.
An
incident
occurred
on
the
road
,
*NL*
which
,
though
apparently
of
little
consequence
,
made
a
great
impression
on
*NL*
him
.
Just
after
he
had
crossed
the
square
and
turned
the
corner
coming
out
*NL*
into
Mihailovsky
Street
,
which
is
divided
by
a
small
ditch
from
the
High
*NL*
Street
-LRB-
our
whole
town
is
intersected
by
ditches
-RRB-
,
he
saw
a
group
of
*NL*
schoolboys
between
the
ages
of
nine
and
twelve
,
at
the
bridge
.
They
were
*NL*
going
home
from
school
,
some
with
their
bags
on
their
shoulders
,
others
*NL*
with
leather
satchels
slung
across
them
,
some
in
short
jackets
,
others
in
*NL*
little
overcoats
.
Some
even
had
those
high
boots
with
creases
round
the
*NL*
ankles
,
such
as
little
boys
spoilt
by
rich
fathers
love
to
wear
.
The
whole
*NL*
group
was
talking
eagerly
about
something
,
apparently
holding
a
council
.
*NL*
Alyosha
had
never
from
his
Moscow
days
been
able
to
pass
children
without
*NL*
taking
notice
of
them
,
and
although
he
was
particularly
fond
of
children
*NL*
of
three
or
thereabout
,
he
liked
schoolboys
of
ten
and
eleven
too
.
And
so
,
*NL*
anxious
as
he
was
to-day
,
he
wanted
at
once
to
turn
aside
to
talk
to
them
.
*NL*
He
looked
into
their
excited
rosy
faces
,
and
noticed
at
once
that
all
the
*NL*
boys
had
stones
in
their
hands
.
Behind
the
ditch
some
thirty
paces
away
,
*NL*
there
was
another
schoolboy
standing
by
a
fence
.
He
too
had
a
satchel
at
*NL*
his
side
.
He
was
about
ten
years
old
,
pale
,
delicate-looking
and
with
*NL*
sparkling
black
eyes
.
He
kept
an
attentive
and
anxious
watch
on
the
other
*NL*
six
,
obviously
his
schoolfellows
with
whom
he
had
just
come
out
of
school
,
*NL*
but
with
whom
he
had
evidently
had
a
feud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
up
and
,
addressing
a
fair
,
curly-headed
,
rosy
boy
in
a
black
*NL*
jacket
,
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
used
to
wear
a
satchel
like
yours
,
I
always
used
to
carry
it
on
my
*NL*
left
side
,
so
as
to
have
my
right
hand
free
,
but
you
've
got
yours
on
your
*NL*
right
side
.
So
it
will
be
awkward
for
you
to
get
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
had
no
art
or
premeditation
in
beginning
with
this
practical
*NL*
remark
.
But
it
is
the
only
way
for
a
grown-up
person
to
get
at
once
into
*NL*
confidential
relations
with
a
child
,
or
still
more
with
a
group
of
*NL*
children
.
One
must
begin
in
a
serious
,
businesslike
way
so
as
to
be
on
a
*NL*
perfectly
equal
footing
.
Alyosha
understood
it
by
instinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
is
left-handed
,
''
another
,
a
fine
healthy-looking
boy
of
eleven
,
*NL*
answered
promptly
.
All
the
others
stared
at
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
even
throws
stones
with
his
left
hand
,
''
observed
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
a
stone
flew
into
the
group
,
but
only
just
grazed
the
*NL*
left-handed
boy
,
though
it
was
well
and
vigorously
thrown
by
the
boy
*NL*
standing
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
him
,
hit
him
back
,
Smurov
,
''
they
all
shouted
.
But
Smurov
,
the
*NL*
left-handed
boy
,
needed
no
telling
,
and
at
once
revenged
himself
;
he
threw
*NL*
a
stone
,
but
it
missed
the
boy
and
hit
the
ground
.
The
boy
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
ditch
,
the
pocket
of
whose
coat
was
visibly
bulging
with
stones
,
*NL*
flung
another
stone
at
the
group
;
this
time
it
flew
straight
at
Alyosha
*NL*
and
hit
him
painfully
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
aimed
it
at
you
,
he
meant
it
for
you
.
You
are
Karamazov
,
Karamazov
!
''
*NL*
the
boys
shouted
,
laughing
.
``
Come
,
all
throw
at
him
at
once
!
''
and
six
*NL*
stones
flew
at
the
boy
.
One
struck
the
boy
on
the
head
and
he
fell
down
,
*NL*
but
at
once
leapt
up
and
began
ferociously
returning
their
fire
.
Both
*NL*
sides
threw
stones
incessantly
.
Many
of
the
group
had
their
pockets
full
*NL*
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
about
!
Are
n't
you
ashamed
?
Six
against
one
!
Why
,
you
'll
kill
*NL*
him
,
''
cried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
forward
and
met
the
flying
stones
to
screen
the
solitary
boy
.
Three
*NL*
or
four
ceased
throwing
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
began
first
!
''
cried
a
boy
in
a
red
shirt
in
an
angry
childish
voice
.
*NL*
``
He
is
a
beast
,
he
stabbed
Krassotkin
in
class
the
other
day
with
a
*NL*
penknife
.
It
bled
.
Krassotkin
would
n't
tell
tales
,
but
he
must
be
*NL*
thrashed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
for
?
I
suppose
you
tease
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
he
sent
a
stone
in
your
back
again
,
he
knows
you
,
''
cried
the
*NL*
children
.
``
It
's
you
he
is
throwing
at
now
,
not
us
.
Come
,
all
of
you
,
at
*NL*
him
again
,
do
n't
miss
,
Smurov
!
''
and
again
a
fire
of
stones
,
and
a
very
*NL*
vicious
one
,
began
.
The
boy
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
was
hit
in
the
*NL*
chest
;
he
screamed
,
began
to
cry
and
ran
away
uphill
towards
Mihailovsky
*NL*
Street
.
They
all
shouted
:
``
Aha
,
he
is
funking
,
he
is
running
away
.
Wisp
of
*NL*
tow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
a
beast
he
is
,
Karamazov
,
killing
is
too
good
for
*NL*
him
,
''
said
the
boy
in
the
jacket
,
with
flashing
eyes
.
He
seemed
to
be
the
*NL*
eldest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
wrong
with
him
?
''
asked
Alyosha
,
``
is
he
a
tell-tale
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
looked
at
one
another
as
though
derisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
that
way
,
to
Mihailovsky
?
''
the
same
boy
went
on
.
``
Catch
him
*NL*
up
...
You
see
he
's
stopped
again
,
he
is
waiting
and
looking
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
looking
at
you
,
''
the
other
boys
chimed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
him
,
does
he
like
a
disheveled
wisp
of
tow
.
Do
you
hear
,
ask
him
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
burst
of
laughter
.
Alyosha
looked
at
them
,
and
they
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
near
him
,
he
'll
hurt
you
,
''
cried
Smurov
in
a
warning
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
ask
him
about
the
wisp
of
tow
,
for
I
expect
you
tease
him
with
*NL*
that
question
somehow
.
But
I
'll
find
out
from
him
why
you
hate
him
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
out
then
,
find
out
,
''
cried
the
boys
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
crossed
the
bridge
and
walked
uphill
by
the
fence
,
straight
*NL*
towards
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
look
out
,
''
the
boys
called
after
him
;
``
he
wo
n't
be
afraid
of
*NL*
you
.
He
will
stab
you
in
a
minute
,
on
the
sly
,
as
he
did
Krassotkin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
waited
for
him
without
budging
.
Coming
up
to
him
,
Alyosha
saw
*NL*
facing
him
a
child
of
about
nine
years
old
.
He
was
an
undersized
weakly
*NL*
boy
with
a
thin
pale
face
,
with
large
dark
eyes
that
gazed
at
him
*NL*
vindictively
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
rather
shabby
old
overcoat
,
which
he
had
*NL*
monstrously
outgrown
.
His
bare
arms
stuck
out
beyond
his
sleeves
.
There
*NL*
was
a
large
patch
on
the
right
knee
of
his
trousers
,
and
in
his
right
boot
*NL*
just
at
the
toe
there
was
a
big
hole
in
the
leather
,
carefully
blackened
*NL*
with
ink
.
Both
the
pockets
of
his
great-coat
were
weighed
down
with
*NL*
stones
.
Alyosha
stopped
two
steps
in
front
of
him
,
looking
inquiringly
at
*NL*
him
.
The
boy
,
seeing
at
once
from
Alyosha
's
eyes
that
he
would
n't
beat
*NL*
him
,
became
less
defiant
,
and
addressed
him
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
alone
,
and
there
are
six
of
them
.
I
'll
beat
them
all
,
alone
!
''
he
*NL*
said
suddenly
,
with
flashing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
one
of
the
stones
must
have
hurt
you
badly
,
''
observed
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hit
Smurov
on
the
head
!
''
cried
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
told
me
that
you
know
me
,
and
that
you
threw
a
stone
at
me
on
*NL*
purpose
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
looked
darkly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
you
.
Do
you
know
me
?
''
Alyosha
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
!
''
the
boy
cried
irritably
;
but
he
did
not
move
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
expecting
something
,
and
again
there
was
a
vindictive
light
in
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
am
going
,
''
said
Alyosha
;
``
only
I
do
n't
know
you
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
tease
you
.
They
told
me
how
they
tease
you
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
tease
you
.
*NL*
Good-by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monk
in
silk
trousers
!
''
cried
the
boy
,
following
Alyosha
with
the
same
*NL*
vindictive
and
defiant
expression
,
and
he
threw
himself
into
an
attitude
*NL*
of
defense
,
feeling
sure
that
now
Alyosha
would
fall
upon
him
;
but
Alyosha
*NL*
turned
,
looked
at
him
,
and
walked
away
.
He
had
not
gone
three
steps
before
*NL*
the
biggest
stone
the
boy
had
in
his
pocket
hit
him
a
painful
blow
in
the
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
'll
hit
a
man
from
behind
!
They
tell
the
truth
,
then
,
when
they
say
*NL*
that
you
attack
on
the
sly
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
turning
round
again
.
This
time
*NL*
the
boy
threw
a
stone
savagely
right
into
Alyosha
's
face
;
but
Alyosha
just
*NL*
had
time
to
guard
himself
,
and
the
stone
struck
him
on
the
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
ashamed
?
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
waited
in
silent
defiance
,
certain
that
now
Alyosha
would
attack
*NL*
him
.
Seeing
that
even
now
he
would
not
,
his
rage
was
like
a
little
wild
*NL*
beast
's
;
he
flew
at
Alyosha
himself
,
and
before
Alyosha
had
time
to
move
,
*NL*
the
spiteful
child
had
seized
his
left
hand
with
both
of
his
and
bit
his
*NL*
middle
finger
.
He
fixed
his
teeth
in
it
and
it
was
ten
seconds
before
he
*NL*
let
go
.
Alyosha
cried
out
with
pain
and
pulled
his
finger
away
with
all
*NL*
his
might
.
The
child
let
go
at
last
and
retreated
to
his
former
distance
.
*NL*
Alyosha
's
finger
had
been
badly
bitten
to
the
bone
,
close
to
the
nail
;
it
*NL*
began
to
bleed
.
Alyosha
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
bound
it
tightly
*NL*
round
his
injured
hand
.
He
was
a
full
minute
bandaging
it
.
The
boy
stood
*NL*
waiting
all
the
time
.
At
last
Alyosha
raised
his
gentle
eyes
and
looked
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
see
how
badly
you
've
bitten
me
.
That
's
enough
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
Now
tell
me
,
what
have
I
done
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
stared
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
I
do
n't
know
you
and
it
's
the
first
time
I
've
seen
you
,
''
Alyosha
*NL*
went
on
with
the
same
serenity
,
``
yet
I
must
have
done
something
to
you
--
you
*NL*
would
n't
have
hurt
me
like
this
for
nothing
.
So
what
have
I
done
?
How
have
*NL*
I
wronged
you
,
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
answering
,
the
boy
broke
into
a
loud
tearful
wail
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
Alyosha
walked
slowly
after
him
towards
Mihailovsky
Street
,
and
for
a
long
*NL*
time
he
saw
the
child
running
in
the
distance
as
fast
as
ever
,
not
turning
*NL*
his
head
,
and
no
doubt
still
keeping
up
his
tearful
wail
.
He
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
find
him
out
as
soon
as
he
had
time
,
and
to
solve
this
mystery
.
*NL*
Just
now
he
had
not
the

Chapter
IV
.
At
The
Hohlakovs
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
soon
reached
Madame
Hohlakov
's
house
,
a
handsome
stone
house
of
*NL*
two
stories
,
one
of
the
finest
in
our
town
.
Though
Madame
Hohlakov
spent
*NL*
most
of
her
time
in
another
province
where
she
had
an
estate
,
or
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
where
she
had
a
house
of
her
own
,
yet
she
had
a
house
in
our
town
*NL*
too
,
inherited
from
her
forefathers
.
The
estate
in
our
district
was
the
*NL*
largest
of
her
three
estates
,
yet
she
had
been
very
little
in
our
province
*NL*
before
this
time
.
She
ran
out
to
Alyosha
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
my
letter
about
the
new
miracle
?
''
She
spoke
rapidly
and
*NL*
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
show
it
to
every
one
?
He
restored
the
son
to
his
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dying
to-day
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
,
I
know
,
oh
,
how
I
long
to
talk
to
you
,
to
you
or
some
one
,
*NL*
about
all
this
.
No
,
to
you
,
to
you
!
And
how
sorry
I
am
I
ca
n't
see
him
!
*NL*
The
whole
town
is
in
excitement
,
they
are
all
suspense
.
But
now
--
do
you
*NL*
know
Katerina
Ivanovna
is
here
now
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
lucky

cried
Alyosha
.
``
Then
I
shall
see
her

She
told

I
've
heard
exactly
what
happened
yesterday
--
and
the
*NL*
atrocious
behavior
of
that
--
creature
.
_
C'est
tragique
_
,
and
if
I
'd
been
in
*NL*
her
place
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
have
done
.
And
your
brother
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
what
do
you
think
of
him
?
--
my
goodness
!
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
I
am
forgetting
,
only
fancy
;
your
brother
is
in
there
with
her
,
not
that
*NL*
dreadful
brother
who
was
so
shocking
yesterday
,
but
the
other
,
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
he
is
sitting
with
her
talking
;
they
are
having
a
serious
*NL*
conversation
.
If
you
could
only
imagine
what
's
passing
between
them
*NL*
now
--
it
's
awful
,
I
tell
you
it
's
lacerating
,
it
's
like
some
incredible
tale
*NL*
of
horror
.
They
are
ruining
their
lives
for
no
reason
any
one
can
see
.
*NL*
They
both
recognize
it
and
revel
in
it
.
I
've
been
watching
for
you
!
I
've
*NL*
been
thirsting
for
you
!
It
's
too
much
for
me
,
that
's
the
worst
of
it
.
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
,
but
now
I
must
speak
of
something
else
,
*NL*
the
most
important
thing
--
I
had
quite
forgotten
what
's
most
important
.
Tell
*NL*
me
,
why
has
Lise
been
in
hysterics
?
As
soon
as
she
heard
you
were
here
,
*NL*
she
began
to
be
hysterical
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Maman
_
,
it
's
you
who
are
hysterical
now
,
not
I
,
''
Lise
's
voice
caroled
*NL*
through
a
tiny
crack
of
the
door
at
the
side
.
Her
voice
sounded
as
though
*NL*
she
wanted
to
laugh
,
but
was
doing
her
utmost
to
control
it
.
Alyosha
at
*NL*
once
noticed
the
crack
,
and
no
doubt
Lise
was
peeping
through
it
,
but
that
*NL*
he
could
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
no
wonder
,
Lise
,
no
wonder

your
caprices
will
make
me
hysterical

too

But
she
is
so
ill
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
she
has
been
so
ill
all
*NL*
night
,
feverish
and
moaning
!
I
could
hardly
wait
for
the
morning
and
for
*NL*
Herzenstube
to
come
.
He
says
that
he
can
make
nothing
of
it
,
that
we
must
*NL*
wait
.
Herzenstube
always
comes
and
says
that
he
can
make
nothing
of
it
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
you
approached
the
house
,
she
screamed
,
fell
into
hysterics
,
and
*NL*
insisted
on
being
wheeled
back
into
this
room
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma

*NL*

``

Alyosha
unbound

The

soaked

Madame

as

flung

wide
open

*NL*

she
finished
nervously

*NL*
Yulia
ran
in
with
water

put
his

in

*NL*
Instinctively
feeling
that
the
time
of
her
mother

absence
was
precious

for

Alyosha
hastened
to
tell
her
of
his
enigmatic
meeting
with
the
*NL*
schoolboys
in
the
fewest
words
possible

Lise
clasped
her
hands
at
his

story

*NL*
``
How
can
you

angrily

as

had
a
right
to
control
him

You

nothing

mystery
in

Now
for

second
thing

first
a
question

does
the
*NL*
pain
prevent
you
talking

talking

sensibly

Chapter
V

A
Laceration
In
The
Drawing-Room
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
drawing-room
the
conversation
was
already
over
.
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
was
greatly
excited
,
though
she
looked
resolute
.
At
the
moment
*NL*
Alyosha
and
Madame
Hohlakov
entered
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
stood
up
to
take
*NL*
leave
.
His
face
was
rather
pale
,
and
Alyosha
looked
at
him
anxiously
.
For
*NL*
this
moment
was
to
solve
a
doubt
,
a
harassing
enigma
which
had
for
some
*NL*
time
haunted
Alyosha
.
During
the
preceding
month
it
had
been
several
times
*NL*
suggested
to
him
that
his
brother
Ivan
was
in
love
with
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
and
,
what
was
more
,
that
he
meant
``
to
carry
her
off
''
from
Dmitri
.
Until
*NL*
quite
lately
the
idea
seemed
to
Alyosha
monstrous
,
though
it
worried
him
*NL*
extremely
.
He
loved
both
his
brothers
,
and
dreaded
such
rivalry
between
*NL*
them
.
Meantime
,
Dmitri
had
said
outright
on
the
previous
day
that
he
was
*NL*
glad
that
Ivan
was
his
rival
,
and
that
it
was
a
great
assistance
to
him
,
*NL*
Dmitri
.
In
what
way
did
it
assist
him
?
To
marry
Grushenka
?
But
that
*NL*
Alyosha
considered
the
worst
thing
possible
.
Besides
all
this
,
Alyosha
had
*NL*
till
the
evening
before
implicitly
believed
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
a
*NL*
steadfast
and
passionate
love
for
Dmitri
;
but
he
had
only
believed
it
till
*NL*
the
evening
before
.
He
had
fancied
,
too
,
that
she
was
incapable
of
loving
*NL*
a
man
like
Ivan
,
and
that
she
did
love
Dmitri
,
and
loved
him
just
as
he
*NL*
was
,
in
spite
of
all
the
strangeness
of
such
a
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
during
yesterday
's
scene
with
Grushenka
another
idea
had
struck
him
.
*NL*
The
word
``
lacerating
,
''
which
Madame
Hohlakov
had
just
uttered
,
almost
made
*NL*
him
start
,
because
half
waking
up
towards
daybreak
that
night
he
had
cried
*NL*
out
``
Laceration
,
laceration
,
''
probably
applying
it
to
his
dream
.
He
had
*NL*
been
dreaming
all
night
of
the
previous
day
's
scene
at
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
.
Now
Alyosha
was
impressed
by
Madame
Hohlakov
's
blunt
and
*NL*
persistent
assertion
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
in
love
with
Ivan
,
and
*NL*
only
deceived
herself
through
some
sort
of
pose
,
from
``
self-laceration
,
''
*NL*
and
tortured
herself
by
her
pretended
love
for
Dmitri
from
some
fancied
*NL*
duty
of
gratitude
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
thought
,
``
perhaps
the
whole
truth
lies
in
*NL*
those
words
.
''
But
in
that
case
what
was
Ivan
's
position
?
Alyosha
felt
*NL*
instinctively
that
a
character
like
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
must
dominate
,
and
*NL*
she
could
only
dominate
some
one
like
Dmitri
,
and
never
a
man
like
Ivan
.
*NL*
For
Dmitri
might
at
last
submit
to
her
domination
``
to
his
own
happiness
''
*NL*
-LRB-
which
was
what
Alyosha
would
have
desired
-RRB-
,
but
Ivan
--
no
,
Ivan
could
not
*NL*
submit
to
her
,
and
such
submission
would
not
give
him
happiness
.
Alyosha
*NL*
could
not
help
believing
that
of
Ivan
.
And
now
all
these
doubts
and
*NL*
reflections
flitted
through
his
mind
as
he
entered
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
Another
idea
,
too
,
forced
itself
upon
him
:
``
What
if
she
loved
neither
of
*NL*
them
--
neither
Ivan
nor
Dmitri
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
noted
that
Alyosha
felt
as
it
were
ashamed
of
his
own
thoughts
*NL*
and
blamed
himself
when
they
kept
recurring
to
him
during
the
last
month
.
*NL*
``
What
do
I
know
about
love
and
women
and
how
can
I
decide
such
questions
?
''
*NL*
he
thought
reproachfully
,
after
such
doubts
and
surmises
.
And
yet
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
think
about
it
.
He
felt
instinctively
that
this
rivalry
*NL*
was
of
immense
importance
in
his
brothers
'
lives
and
that
a
great
deal
*NL*
depended
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
reptile
will
devour
the
other
,
''
Ivan
had
pronounced
the
day
before
,
*NL*
speaking
in
anger
of
his
father
and
Dmitri
.
So
Ivan
looked
upon
Dmitri
as
*NL*
a
reptile
,
and
perhaps
had
long
done
so
.
Was
it
perhaps
since
he
had
known
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
?
That
phrase
had
,
of
course
,
escaped
Ivan
unawares
*NL*
yesterday
,
but
that
only
made
it
more
important
.
If
he
felt
like
that
,
*NL*
what
chance
was
there
of
peace
?
Were
there
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
new
*NL*
grounds
for
hatred
and
hostility
in
their
family
?
And
with
which
of
them
*NL*
was
Alyosha
to
sympathize
?
And
what
was
he
to
wish
for
each
of
them
?
He
*NL*
loved
them
both
,
but
what
could
he
desire
for
each
in
the
midst
of
these
*NL*
conflicting
interests
?
He
might
go
quite
astray
in
this
maze
,
and
*NL*
Alyosha
's
heart
could
not
endure
uncertainty
,
because
his
love
was
always
*NL*
of
an
active
character
.
He
was
incapable
of
passive
love
.
If
he
loved
any
*NL*
one
,
he
set
to
work
at
once
to
help
him
.
And
to
do
so
he
must
know
what
he
*NL*
was
aiming
at
;
he
must
know
for
certain
what
was
best
for
each
,
and
having
*NL*
ascertained
this
it
was
natural
for
him
to
help
them
both
.
But
instead
of
*NL*
a
definite
aim
,
he
found
nothing
but
uncertainty
and
perplexity
on
all
*NL*
sides
.
``
It
was
lacerating
,
''
as
was
said
just
now
.
But
what
could
he
*NL*
understand
even
in
this
``
laceration
''
?
He
did
not
understand
the
first
word
*NL*
in
this
perplexing
maze
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
Alyosha
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
said
quickly
and
joyfully
to
Ivan
,
who
*NL*
had
already
got
up
to
go
,
``
A
minute
!
Stay
another
minute
!
I
want
to
hear
*NL*
the
opinion
of
this
person
here
whom
I
trust
absolutely
.
Do
n't
go
away
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
addressing
Madame
Hohlakov
.
She
made
Alyosha
sit
down
beside
*NL*
her
,
and
Madame
Hohlakov
sat
opposite
,
by
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
all
my
friends
here
,
all
I
have
in
the
world
,
my
dear
friends
,
''
*NL*
she
began
warmly
,
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
genuine
tears
of
*NL*
suffering
,
and
Alyosha
's
heart
warmed
to
her
at
once
.
``
You
,
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
were
witness
yesterday
of
that
abominable
scene
,
and
saw
*NL*
what
I
did
.
You
did
not
see
it
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
he
did
.
What
he
thought
*NL*
of
me
yesterday
I
do
n't
know
.
I
only
know
one
thing
,
that
if
it
were
*NL*
repeated
to-day
,
this
minute
,
I
should
express
the
same
feelings
again
as
*NL*
yesterday
--
the
same
feelings
,
the
same
words
,
the
same
actions
.
You
*NL*
remember
my
actions
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
;
you
checked
me
in
one
of
them
''
*NL*
...
-LRB-
as
she
said
that
,
she
flushed
and
her
eyes
shone
-RRB-
.
``
I
must
tell
you
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
get
over
it

Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
I
do
n't
even
know
*NL*
whether
I
still
love
_
him
_
.
I
feel
_
pity
_
for
him
,
and
that
is
a
poor
sign
*NL*
of
love
.
If
I
loved
him
,
if
I
still
loved
him
,
perhaps
I
should
n't
be
*NL*
sorry
for
him
now
,
but
should
hate
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
quivered
,
and
tears
glittered
on
her
eyelashes
.
Alyosha
*NL*
shuddered
inwardly
.
``
That
girl
is
truthful
and
sincere
,
''
he
thought
,
``
and
*NL*
she
does
not
love
Dmitri
any
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's

cried
Madame
Hohlakov

*NL*
*NL*
``

feel
that
perhaps

foresee

ecstatically

taking

in

something
impelled
him

add
hurriedly

``
In

something

higher
perhaps

even
than
duty
.
I
am
conscious
of
this
irresistible
feeling
in
my
heart
,
*NL*
and
it
compels
me
irresistibly
.
But
it
may
all
be
put
in
two
words

I
've
*NL*
already
decided
,
even
if
he
marries
that

creature

she
began
solemnly
,
*NL*
``

will
not

Henceforward
I
will
never

never

she
cried
,
breaking
into
a
*NL*
sort
of
pale
,
hysterical
ecstasy
.
``
Not
that
I
would
run

get
in

him

that

really

point

god
to
whom
*NL*
he
can
pray
--
and
that
,
at
least
,
he
owes
me
for
his
treachery
and
for
what
*NL*
I
suffered
yesterday
through
him
.
And
let
him
see
that
all
my
life
I
will
*NL*
be
true
to
him
and
the
promise
I
gave
him
,
in
spite
of
his
being
untrue
*NL*
and
betraying
me
.
I
will
--
I
will
become
nothing
but
a
means
for
his
*NL*
happiness
,
or
--
how
shall
I
say
?
--
an
instrument
,
a
machine
for
his
happiness
,
*NL*
and
that
for
my
whole
life
,
my
whole
life
,
and
that
he
may
see
that
all
*NL*
his
life
!
That
's
my
decision
.
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
fully
approves
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
breathless
.
She
had
perhaps
intended
to
express
her
idea
with
more
*NL*
dignity
,
art
and
naturalness
,
but
her
speech
was
too
hurried
and
crude
.
It
*NL*
was
full
of
youthful
impulsiveness
,
it
betrayed
that
she
was
still
*NL*
smarting
from
yesterday
's
insult
,
and
that
her
pride
craved
satisfaction
.
*NL*
She
felt
this
herself
.
Her
face
suddenly
darkened
,
an
unpleasant
look
came
*NL*
into
her
eyes
.
Alyosha
at
once
saw
it
and
felt
a
pang
of
sympathy
.
His
*NL*
brother
Ivan
made
it
worse
by
adding
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
only
expressed
my
own
view
,
''
he
said
.
``
From
any
one
else
,
this
would
*NL*
have
been
affected
and
overstrained
,
but
from
you
--
no
.
Any
other
woman
*NL*
would
have
been
wrong
,
but
you
are
right
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
*NL*
but
I
see
that
you
are
absolutely
genuine
and
,
therefore
,
you
are
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
only
for
the
moment
.
And
what
does
this
moment
stand
for
?
*NL*
Nothing
but
yesterday
's
insult
.
''
Madame
Hohlakov
obviously
had
not
*NL*
intended
to
interfere
,
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
this
very
just
*NL*
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
quite
so
,
''
cried
Ivan
,
with
peculiar
eagerness
,
obviously
*NL*
annoyed
at
being
interrupted
,
``
in
any
one
else
this
moment
would
be
only
*NL*
due
to
yesterday
's
impression
and
would
be
only
a
moment
.
But
with
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
character
,
that
moment
will
last
all
her
life
.
What
*NL*
for
any
one
else
would
be
only
a
promise
is
for
her
an
everlasting
*NL*
burdensome
,
grim
perhaps
,
but
unflagging
duty
.
And
she
will
be
sustained
*NL*
by
the
feeling
of
this
duty
being
fulfilled
.
Your
life
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
will
henceforth
be
spent
in
painful
brooding
over
your
own
feelings
,
your
*NL*
own
heroism
,
and
your
own
suffering
;
but
in
the
end
that
suffering
will
be
*NL*
softened
and
will
pass
into
sweet
contemplation
of
the
fulfillment
of
a
*NL*
bold
and
proud
design
.
Yes
,
proud
it
certainly
is
,
and
desperate
in
any
*NL*
case
,
but
a
triumph
for
you
.
And
the
consciousness
of
it
will
at
last
be
a
*NL*
source
of
complete
satisfaction
and
will
make
you
resigned
to
everything
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
unmistakably
said
with
some
malice
and
obviously
with
intention
;
*NL*
even
perhaps
with
no
desire
to
conceal
that
he
spoke
ironically
and
with
*NL*
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
how
mistaken
it
all
is
!
''
Madame
Hohlakov
cried
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
you
speak
.
I
want
dreadfully
to
know
what
you
will
*NL*
say
!
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
Alyosha
got
up
from
*NL*
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
nothing
!
''
she
went
on
through
her
tears
.
``
I
'm
upset
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
sleep
last
night
.
But
by
the
side
of
two
such
friends
as
you
and
*NL*
your
brother
I
still
feel
strong
--
for
I
know
--
you
two
will
never
desert
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unluckily
I
am
obliged
to
return
to
Moscow
--
perhaps
to-morrow
--
and
to
leave
*NL*
you
for
a
long
time
--
And
,
unluckily
,
it
's
unavoidable
,
''
Ivan
said
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
--
to
Moscow
!
''
her
face
was
suddenly
contorted
;
``
but
--
but
,
dear
me
,
*NL*
how
fortunate
!
''
she
cried
in
a
voice
suddenly
changed
.
In
one
instant
*NL*
there
was
no
trace
left
of
her
tears
.
She
underwent
an
instantaneous
*NL*
transformation
,
which
amazed
Alyosha
.
Instead
of
a
poor
,
insulted
girl
,
*NL*
weeping
in
a
sort
of
``
laceration
,
''
he
saw
a
woman
completely
self
-
*NL*
possessed
and
even
exceedingly
pleased
,
as
though
something
agreeable
had
*NL*
just
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
fortunate
that
I
am
losing
you
,
of
course
not
,
''
she
corrected
*NL*
herself
suddenly
,
with
a
charming
society
smile
.
``
Such
a
friend
as
you
are
*NL*
could
not
suppose
that
.
I
am
only
too
unhappy
at
losing
you
.
''
She
rushed
*NL*
impulsively
at
Ivan
,
and
seizing
both
his
hands
,
pressed
them
warmly
.
``
But
*NL*
what
is
fortunate
is
that
you
will
be
able
in
Moscow
to
see
auntie
and
*NL*
Agafya
and
to
tell
them
all
the
horror
of
my
present
position
.
You
can
*NL*
speak
with
complete
openness
to
Agafya
,
but
spare
dear
auntie
.
You
will
*NL*
know
how
to
do
that
.
You
ca
n't
think
how
wretched
I
was
yesterday
and
this
*NL*
morning
,
wondering
how
I
could
write
them
that
dreadful
letter
--
for
one
can
*NL*
never
tell
such
things
in
a
letter
...
Now
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
*NL*
write
,
for
you
will
see
them
and
explain
everything
.
Oh
,
how
glad
I
am
!
*NL*
But
I
am
only
glad
of
that
,
believe
me
.
Of
course
,
no
one
can
take
your
*NL*
place
...
I
will
run
at
once
to
write
the
letter
,
''
she
finished
suddenly
,
*NL*
and
took
a
step
as
though
to
go
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
Alyosha
and
his
opinion
,
which
you
were
so
desperately
*NL*
anxious
to
hear
?
''
cried
Madame
Hohlakov
.
There
was
a
sarcastic
,
angry
note
*NL*
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
forgotten
that
,
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
coming
to
a
sudden
*NL*
standstill
,
``
and
why
are
you
so
antagonistic
at
such
a
moment
?
''
she
added
,
*NL*
with
warm
and
bitter
reproachfulness
.
``
What
I
said
,
I
repeat
.
I
must
have
*NL*
his
opinion

More
than
that
,
I
must
have
his
decision
!
As
he
says
,
so
it
*NL*
shall
be
.
You
see
how
anxious
I
am
for
your
words
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch

*NL*
But
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
have
believed
it

I
ca
n't
understand
it

Alyosha
cried
*NL*
suddenly
in
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
going
to
Moscow
,
and
you
cry
out
that
you
are
glad

You
said
that
*NL*
on
purpose
!
And
you
begin
explaining
that
you
are
not
glad
of
that
but
*NL*
sorry
to
be
--
losing
a
friend
.
But
that
was
acting
,
too
--
you
were
playing
a
*NL*
part
--
as
in
a
theater
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
theater
?
What
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
exclaimed
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
profoundly
astonished
,
flushing
crimson
,
and
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
you
assure
him
you
are
sorry
to
lose
a
friend
in
him
,
you
persist
*NL*
in
telling
him
to
his
face
that
it
's
fortunate
he
is
going
,
''
said
Alyosha
*NL*
breathlessly
.
He
was
standing
at
the
table
and
did
not
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
myself

I
seemed
to
see
in
a
flash

I
know
I
am
*NL*
not
saying
it
properly
,
but
I
'll
say
it
all
the
same
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
in
*NL*
the
same
shaking
and
broken
voice
.
``
What
I
see
is
that
perhaps
you
do
n't
*NL*
love
Dmitri
at
all

and
never
have

from
the
beginning
...
And
Dmitri
,
*NL*
too
,
has
never
loved
you
...
and
only
esteems
you
...
I
really
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
I
dare
to
say
all
this
,
but
somebody
must
tell
the
truth
...
for
*NL*
nobody
here
will
tell
the
truth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
truth
?
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
there
was
an
hysterical
ring
in
*NL*
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
with
desperate
haste
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
jumping
from
the
top
of
a
house
.
``
Call
Dmitri
;
I
will
fetch
him

and
let
*NL*
him
come
here

take
your

take
Ivan
's
and
join
your
hands

For
*NL*
you
're
torturing
Ivan
,
simply
because
you
love
him
--
and
torturing
him
,
*NL*
because
you
love
Dmitri
through
`
self-laceration
'
--
with
an
unreal
*NL*
love
--
because
you
've
persuaded
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
broke
off
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
...
you
...
you
are
a
little
religious
idiot
--
that
's
what
you
are
!
''
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
snapped
.
Her
face
was
white
and
her
lips
were
moving
*NL*
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
suddenly
laughed
and
got
up
.
His
hat
was
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
my
good
Alyosha
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
expression
Alyosha
*NL*
had
never
seen
in
his
face
before
--
an
expression
of
youthful
sincerity
and
*NL*
strong
,
irresistibly
frank
feeling
.
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
has
never
cared
for
*NL*
me
!
She
has
known
all
the
time
that
I
cared
for
her
--
though
I
never
said
a
*NL*
word
of
my
love
to
her
--
she
knew
,
but
she
did
n't
care
for
me
.
I
have
never
*NL*
been
her
friend
either
,
not
for
one
moment
;
she
is
too
proud
to
need
my
*NL*
friendship
.
She
kept
me
at
her
side
as
a
means
of
revenge
.
She
revenged
*NL*
with
me
and
on
me
all
the
insults
which
she
has
been
continually
receiving
*NL*
from
Dmitri
ever
since
their
first
meeting
.
For
even
that
first
meeting
*NL*
has
rankled
in
her
heart
as
an
insult
--
that
's
what
her
heart
is
like
!
She
*NL*
has
talked
to
me
of
nothing
but
her
love
for
him
.
I
am
going
now
;
but
,
*NL*
believe
me
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
you
really
love
him
.
And
the
more
he
*NL*
insults
you
,
the
more
you
love
him
--
that
's
your
`
laceration
.
'
You
love
him
*NL*
just
as
he
is
;
you
love
him
for
insulting
you
.
If
he
reformed
,
you
'd
give
*NL*
him
up
at
once
and
cease
to
love
him
.
But
you
need
him
so
as
to
*NL*
contemplate
continually
your
heroic
fidelity
and
to
reproach
him
for
*NL*
infidelity
.
And
it
all
comes
from
your
pride
.
Oh
,
there
's
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
humiliation
and
self-abasement
about
it
,
but
it
all
comes
from
pride
...
I
*NL*
am
too
young
and
I
've
loved
you
too
much
.
I
know
that
I
ought
not
to
say
*NL*
this
,
that
it
would
be
more
dignified
on
my
part
simply
to
leave
you
,
and
*NL*
it
would
be
less
offensive
for
you
.
But
I
am
going
far
away
,
and
shall
*NL*
never
come
back
...
It
is
for
ever
.
I
do
n't
want
to
sit
beside
a
*NL*
`
laceration
.
'
...
But
I
do
n't
know
how
to
speak
now
.
I
've
said
*NL*
everything

Good-by
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
;
you
ca
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
for
*NL*
I
am
a
hundred
times
more
severely
punished
than
you
,
if
only
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
I
shall
never
see
you
again
.
Good-by
!
I
do
n't
want
your
hand

You
*NL*
have
tortured
me
too
deliberately
for
me
to
be
able
to
forgive
you
at
this
*NL*
moment

I
shall
forgive
you
later

now
I
do
n't
want
your
hand

''
he
added
,
with
a
forced
smile
,
showing
,
*NL*
however
,
that
he
could
read
Schiller
,
and
read
him
till
he
knew
him
by
*NL*
heart
--
which
Alyosha
would
never
have
believed
.
He
went
out
of
the
room
*NL*
without
saying
good-by
even
to
his
hostess
,
Madame
Hohlakov
.
Alyosha
*NL*
clasped
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan

he
cried
desperately
after
him
.
``
Come
back
,
Ivan
!
No

nothing
will
*NL*
induce
him
to
come
back
now

he
cried
again
,
regretfully
realizing
it
;
*NL*
``
but
it
's
my
fault

my
fault

I
began
it

Ivan
spoke
angrily

wrongly

Unjustly
and
angrily

He

come
back
here

come
back

Alyosha
kept
*NL*
exclaiming
frantically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
went
suddenly
into
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
done
no
harm

You
behaved
beautifully
,
like
an
angel

''
Madame
*NL*
Hohlakov
whispered
rapidly
and
ecstatically
to
Alyosha
.
``
I
will
do
my
*NL*
utmost
to
prevent
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
from
going

*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
beamed
with
delight
,
to
the
great
distress
of
Alyosha
,
but
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
suddenly
returned
.
She
had
two
hundred-rouble
notes
in
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
''
she
began
,
*NL*
addressing
Alyosha
with
an
apparently
calm
and
even
voice
,
as
though
*NL*
nothing
had
happened
.
``
A
week
--
yes
,
I
think
it
was
a
week
ago
--
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
was
guilty
of
a
hasty
and
unjust
action

a
very
ugly
action

*NL*
There
is
a
low
tavern
here
,
and
in
it
he
met
that
discharged
officer
,
that
*NL*
captain
,
whom
your
father
used
to
employ
in
some
business
.
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
somehow
lost
his
temper
with
this
captain
,
seized
him
by
the
*NL*
beard
and
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
and
for
some
distance
along
it
,
*NL*
in
that
insulting
fashion
.
And
I
am
told
that
his
son
,
a
boy
,
quite
a
*NL*
child
,
who
is
at
the
school
here
,
saw
it
and
ran
beside
them
crying
and
*NL*
begging
for
his
father
,
appealing
to
every
one
to
defend
him
,
while
every
*NL*
one
laughed
.
You
must
forgive
me
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
I
can
not
think
*NL*
without
indignation
of
that
disgraceful
action
of
_
his
_
...
one
of
those
*NL*
actions
of
which
only
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
would
be
capable
in
his
anger
*NL*
...
and
in
his
passions
!
I
ca
n't
describe
it
even
...
I
ca
n't
find
my
*NL*
words
.
I
've
made
inquiries
about
his
victim
,
and
find
he
is
quite
a
poor
*NL*
man
.
His
name
is
Snegiryov
.
He
did
something
wrong
in
the
army
and
was
*NL*
discharged
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
.
And
now
he
has
sunk
into
terrible
*NL*
destitution
,
with
his
family
--
an
unhappy
family
of
sick
children
,
and
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
an
insane
wife
.
He
has
been
living
here
a
long
time
;
he
used
to
*NL*
work
as
a
copying
clerk
,
but
now
he
is
getting
nothing
.
I
thought
if
you
*NL*
...
that
is
I
thought
...
I
do
n't
know
.
I
am
so
confused
.
You
see
,
I
*NL*
wanted
to
ask
you
,
my
dear
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
to
go
to
him
,
to
find
some
*NL*
excuse
to
go
to
them
--
I
mean
to
that
captain
--
oh
,
goodness
,
how
badly
I
*NL*
explain
it
!
--
and
delicately
,
carefully
,
as
only
you
know
how
to
''
-LRB-
Alyosha
*NL*
blushed
-RRB-
,
``
manage
to
give
him
this
assistance
,
these
two
hundred
roubles
.
*NL*
He
will
be
sure
to
take
it
...
I
mean
,
persuade
him
to
take
it
...
Or
,
*NL*
rather
,
what
do
I
mean
?
You
see
it
's
not
by
way
of
compensation
to
prevent
*NL*
him
from
taking
proceedings
-LRB-
for
I
believe
he
meant
to
-RRB-
,
but
simply
a
*NL*
token
of
sympathy
,
of
a
desire
to
assist
him
from
me
,
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
's
betrothed
,
not
from
himself
...
But
you
know
...
I
would
go
*NL*
myself
,
but
you
'll
know
how
to
do
it
ever
so
much
better
.
He
lives
in
Lake
*NL*
Street
,
in
the
house
of
a
woman
called
Kalmikov
...
For
God
's
sake
,
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
do
it
for
me
,
and
now
...
now
I
am
rather

tired

Good

*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
and
disappeared
behind
the
portiere
so
quickly
that
Alyosha
had
*NL*
not
time
to
utter
a
word
,
though
he
wanted
to
speak
.
He
longed
to
beg
her
*NL*
pardon
,
to
blame
himself
,
to
say
something
,
for
his
heart
was
full
and
he
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
go
out
of
the
room
without
it
.
But
Madame
Hohlakov
took
*NL*
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
along
with
her
.
In
the
hall
she
stopped
him
*NL*
again
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
proud
,
she
is
struggling
with
herself
;
but
kind
,
charming

*NL*
generous

she
exclaimed
,
in
a
half-whisper
.
``
Oh

how
I
love

sometimes

and
how
glad
I

Dear
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
you
did
n't
know

I
must
tell
you

that
we
all

all
--
both
*NL*

I
and
all
of
us
,
Lise
,
even
--
have
been
hoping

praying
for
*NL*
nothing
for
the
last

but
that
she
may
give
up
your
favorite
Dmitri
,
*NL*
who
takes
no
notice
of
her
and
does
not
care
for
her
,
and
may
marry
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
--
such
an
excellent
and
cultivated
young
man
,
who
loves
her
*NL*
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
We
are
in
a
regular
plot
to
bring
it
*NL*
about
,

I
am
even
staying
on
here
perhaps
on
that
account

``

she
has
been

Alyosha

``

cried
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

all
my

I

Alyosha
repeated
*NL*
unconsoled
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
in
an
agony
of
remorse
for
his
*NL*
indiscretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
the
contrary

you
behaved

heard
again

*NL*
``
I
somehow
fancied
all

Alyosha
went
on
as
though
he
had
not
*NL*
heard

``

At

in

Hysterics
is
a
good
sign

Alexey

;
it
's
an
*NL*
excellent
thing
that
she
is
hysterical

That

just
as
it
ought

In
*NL*
such
cases
I
am
always
against
the

against

feminine

Did

how

young
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
was
just
now
when
he
went
out

when

said
all

went
out

I
thought
he
was
so
learned

such
a

savant

,
and
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
he
behaved
so
warmly

openly
,
and
youthfully
,
with
such
*NL*
youthful
inexperience
,
and
it
was
all
so
fine

like
you

And
the
way
he
*NL*
repeated
that
German

was
just

For

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
at
last
ran
off

Before
leaving

Alyosha
would
have
opened
*NL*
the

to
see

*NL*
*NL*
``

Chapter
VI
.
A
Laceration
In
The
Cottage
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
certainly
was
really
grieved
in
a
way
he
had
seldom
been
before
.
He
had
*NL*
rushed
in
like
a
fool
,
and
meddled
in
what
?
In
a
love-affair
.
``
But
what
do
*NL*
I
know
about
it
?
What
can
I
tell
about
such
things
?
''
he
repeated
to
*NL*
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
,
flushing
crimson
.
``
Oh
,
being
ashamed
would
*NL*
be
nothing
;
shame
is
only
the
punishment
I
deserve
.
The
trouble
is
I
shall
*NL*
certainly
have
caused
more
unhappiness
...
And
Father
Zossima
sent
me
to
*NL*
reconcile
and
bring
them
together
.
Is
this
the
way
to
bring
them
*NL*
together
?
''
Then
he
suddenly
remembered
how
he
had
tried
to
join
their
*NL*
hands
,
and
he
felt
fearfully
ashamed
again
.
``
Though
I
acted
quite
*NL*
sincerely
,
I
must
be
more
sensible
in
the
future
,
''
he
concluded
suddenly
,
*NL*
and
did
not
even
smile
at
his
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
commission
took
him
to
Lake
Street
,
and
his
brother
*NL*
Dmitri
lived
close
by
,
in
a
turning
out
of
Lake
Street
.
Alyosha
decided
to
*NL*
go
to
him
in
any
case
before
going
to
the
captain
,
though
he
had
a
*NL*
presentiment
that
he
would
not
find
his
brother
.
He
suspected
that
he
*NL*
would
intentionally
keep
out
of
his
way
now
,
but
he
must
find
him
anyhow
.
*NL*
Time
was
passing
:
the
thought
of
his
dying
elder
had
not
left
Alyosha
for
*NL*
one
minute
from
the
time
he
set
off
from
the
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
point
which
interested
him
particularly
about
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
commission
;
when
she
had
mentioned
the
captain
's
son
,
the
*NL*
little
schoolboy
who
had
run
beside
his
father
crying
,
the
idea
had
at
*NL*
once
struck
Alyosha
that
this
must
be
the
schoolboy
who
had
bitten
his
*NL*
finger
when
he
,
Alyosha
,
asked
him
what
he
had
done
to
hurt
him
.
Now
*NL*
Alyosha
felt
practically
certain
of
this
,
though
he
could
not
have
said
*NL*
why
.
Thinking
of
another
subject
was
a
relief
,
and
he
resolved
to
think
no
*NL*
more
about
the
``
mischief
''
he
had
done
,
and
not
to
torture
himself
with
*NL*
remorse
,
but
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
,
let
come
what
would
.
At
that
thought
*NL*
he
was
completely
comforted
.
Turning
to
the
street
where
Dmitri
lodged
,
he
*NL*
felt
hungry
,
and
taking
out
of
his
pocket
the
roll
he
had
brought
from
his
*NL*
father
's
,
he
ate
it
.
It
made
him
feel
stronger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
was
not
at
home
.
The
people
of
the
house
,
an
old
cabinet-maker
,
his
*NL*
son
,
and
his
old
wife
,
looked
with
positive
suspicion
at
Alyosha
.
``
He
*NL*
has
n't
slept
here
for
the
last
three
nights
.
Maybe
he
has
gone
away
,
''
the
*NL*
old
man
said
in
answer
to
Alyosha
's
persistent
inquiries
.
Alyosha
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
answering
in
accordance
with
instructions
.
When
he
asked
whether
he
*NL*
were
not
at
Grushenka
's
or
in
hiding
at
Foma
's
-LRB-
Alyosha
spoke
so
freely
on
*NL*
purpose
-RRB-
,
all
three
looked
at
him
in
alarm
.
``
They
are
fond
of
him
,
they
*NL*
are
doing
their
best
for
him
,
''
thought
Alyosha
.
``
That
's
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
found
the
house
in
Lake
Street
.
It
was
a
decrepit
little
house
,
*NL*
sunk
on
one
side
,
with
three
windows
looking
into
the
street
,
and
with
a
*NL*
muddy
yard
,
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
a
solitary
cow
.
He
crossed
the
*NL*
yard
and
found
the
door
opening
into
the
passage
.
On
the
left
of
the
*NL*
passage
lived
the
old
woman
of
the
house
with
her
old
daughter
.
Both
*NL*
seemed
to
be
deaf
.
In
answer
to
his
repeated
inquiry
for
the
captain
,
one
*NL*
of
them
at
last
understood
that
he
was
asking
for
their
lodgers
,
and
*NL*
pointed
to
a
door
across
the
passage
.
The
captain
's
lodging
turned
out
to
*NL*
be
a
simple
cottage
room
.
Alyosha
had
his
hand
on
the
iron
latch
to
open
*NL*
the
door
,
when
he
was
struck
by
the
strange
hush
within
.
Yet
he
knew
from
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
words
that
the
man
had
a
family
.
``
Either
they
are
all
*NL*
asleep
or
perhaps
they
have
heard
me
coming
and
are
waiting
for
me
to
open
*NL*
the
door
.
I
'd
better
knock
first
,
''
and
he
knocked
.
An
answer
came
,
but
not
*NL*
at
once
,
after
an
interval
of
perhaps
ten
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
?
''
shouted
some
one
in
a
loud
and
very
angry
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Alyosha
opened
the
door
and
crossed
the
threshold
.
He
found
himself
*NL*
in
a
regular
peasant
's
room
.
Though
it
was
large
,
it
was
cumbered
up
with
*NL*
domestic
belongings
of
all
sorts
,
and
there
were
several
people
in
it
.
On
*NL*
the
left
was
a
large
Russian
stove
.
From
the
stove
to
the
window
on
the
*NL*
left
was
a
string
running
across
the
room
,
and
on
it
there
were
rags
*NL*
hanging
.
There
was
a
bedstead
against
the
wall
on
each
side
,
right
and
*NL*
left
,
covered
with
knitted
quilts
.
On
the
one
on
the
left
was
a
pyramid
of
*NL*
four
print-covered
pillows
,
each
smaller
than
the
one
beneath
.
On
the
*NL*
other
there
was
only
one
very
small
pillow
.
The
opposite
corner
was
*NL*
screened
off
by
a
curtain
or
a
sheet
hung
on
a
string
.
Behind
this
curtain
*NL*
could
be
seen
a
bed
made
up
on
a
bench
and
a
chair
.
The
rough
square
table
*NL*
of
plain
wood
had
been
moved
into
the
middle
window
.
The
three
windows
,
*NL*
which
consisted
each
of
four
tiny
greenish
mildewy
panes
,
gave
little
*NL*
light
,
and
were
close
shut
,
so
that
the
room
was
not
very
light
and
rather
*NL*
stuffy
.
On
the
table
was
a
frying-pan
with
the
remains
of
some
fried
eggs
,
*NL*
a
half-eaten
piece
of
bread
,
and
a
small
bottle
with
a
few
drops
of
vodka
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
of
genteel
appearance
,
wearing
a
cotton
gown
,
was
sitting
on
a
*NL*
chair
by
the
bed
on
the
left
.
Her
face
was
thin
and
yellow
,
and
her
sunken
*NL*
cheeks
betrayed
at
the
first
glance
that
she
was
ill
.
But
what
struck
*NL*
Alyosha
most
was
the
expression
in
the
poor
woman
's
eyes
--
a
look
of
*NL*
surprised
inquiry
and
yet
of
haughty
pride
.
And
while
he
was
talking
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
her
big
brown
eyes
moved
from
one
speaker
to
the
other
with
*NL*
the
same
haughty
and
questioning
expression
.
Beside
her
at
the
window
*NL*
stood
a
young
girl
,
rather
plain
,
with
scanty
reddish
hair
,
poorly
but
*NL*
very
neatly
dressed
.
She
looked
disdainfully
at
Alyosha
as
he
came
in
.
*NL*
Beside
the
other
bed
was
sitting
another
female
figure
.
She
was
a
very
sad
*NL*
sight
,
a
young
girl
of
about
twenty
,
but
hunchback
and
crippled
``
with
*NL*
withered
legs
,
''
as
Alyosha
was
told
afterwards
.
Her
crutches
stood
in
the
*NL*
corner
close
by
.
The
strikingly
beautiful
and
gentle
eyes
of
this
poor
*NL*
girl
looked
with
mild
serenity
at
Alyosha
.
A
man
of
forty-five
was
sitting
*NL*
at
the
table
,
finishing
the
fried
eggs
.
He
was
spare
,
small
and
weakly
*NL*
built
.
He
had
reddish
hair
and
a
scanty
light-colored
beard
,
very
much
*NL*
like
a
wisp
of
tow
-LRB-
this
comparison
and
the
phrase
``
a
wisp
of
tow
''
flashed
*NL*
at
once
into
Alyosha
's
mind
for
some
reason
,
he
remembered
it
afterwards
-RRB-
.
*NL*
It
was
obviously
this
gentleman
who
had
shouted
to
him
,
as
there
was
no
*NL*
other
man
in
the
room
.
But
when
Alyosha
went
in
,
he
leapt
up
from
the
*NL*
bench
on
which
he
was
sitting
,
and
,
hastily
wiping
his
mouth
with
a
ragged
*NL*
napkin
,
darted
up
to
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
monk
come
to
beg
for
the
monastery
.
A
nice
place
to
come
to
!
''
the
*NL*
girl
standing
in
the
left
corner
said
aloud
.
The
man
spun
round
instantly
*NL*
towards
her
and
answered
her
in
an
excited
and
breaking
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Varvara
,
you
are
wrong
.
Allow
me
to
ask
,
''
he
turned
again
to
Alyosha
,
*NL*
``
what
has
brought
you
to
--
our
retreat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
looked
attentively
at
him
.
It
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
him
.
*NL*
There
was
something
angular
,
flurried
and
irritable
about
him
.
Though
he
*NL*
had
obviously
just
been
drinking
,
he
was
not
drunk
.
There
was
*NL*
extraordinary
impudence
in
his
expression
,
and
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
at
the
*NL*
same
time
there
was
fear
.
He
looked
like
a
man
who
had
long
been
kept
in
*NL*
subjection
and
had
submitted
to
it
,
and
now
had
suddenly
turned
and
was
*NL*
trying
to
assert
himself
.
Or
,
better
still
,
like
a
man
who
wants
*NL*
dreadfully
to
hit
you
but
is
horribly
afraid
you
will
hit
him
.
In
his
*NL*
words
and
in
the
intonation
of
his
shrill
voice
there
was
a
sort
of
crazy
*NL*
humor
,
at
times
spiteful
and
at
times
cringing
,
and
continually
shifting
*NL*
from
one
tone
to
another
.
The
question
about
``
our
retreat
''
he
had
asked
as
*NL*
it
were
quivering
all
over
,
rolling
his
eyes
,
and
skipping
up
so
close
to
*NL*
Alyosha
that
he
instinctively
drew
back
a
step
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
very
*NL*
shabby
dark
cotton
coat
,
patched
and
spotted
.
He
wore
checked
trousers
of
*NL*
an
extremely
light
color
,
long
out
of
fashion
,
and
of
very
thin
material
.
*NL*
They
were
so
crumpled
and
so
short
that
he
looked
as
though
he
had
grown
*NL*
out
of
them
like
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Alexey
Karamazov
,
''
Alyosha
began
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
that
,
sir
,
''
the
gentleman
snapped
out
at
once
to
*NL*
assure
him
that
he
knew
who
he
was
already
.
``
I
am
Captain
Snegiryov
,
sir
,
*NL*
but
I
am
still
desirous
to
know
precisely
what
has
led
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
come
for
nothing
special
.
I
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
--
if
*NL*
only
you
allow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
here
is
a
chair
,
sir
;
kindly
be
seated
.
That
's
what
they
*NL*
used
to
say
in
the
old
comedies
,
`
kindly
be
seated
,
'
''
and
with
a
rapid
*NL*
gesture
he
seized
an
empty
chair
-LRB-
it
was
a
rough
wooden
chair
,
not
*NL*
upholstered
-RRB-
and
set
it
for
him
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
room
;
then
,
*NL*
taking
another
similar
chair
for
himself
,
he
sat
down
facing
Alyosha
,
so
*NL*
close
to
him
that
their
knees
almost
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nikolay
Ilyitch
Snegiryov
,
sir
,
formerly
a
captain
in
the
Russian
*NL*
infantry
,
put
to
shame
for
his
vices
,
but
still
a
captain
.
Though
I
might
*NL*
not
be
one
now
for
the
way
I
talk
;
for
the
last
half
of
my
life
I
've
*NL*
learnt
to
say
`
sir
.
'
It
's
a
word
you
use
when
you
've
come
down
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
true
,
''
smiled
Alyosha
.
``
But
is
it
used
involuntarily
or
on
*NL*
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
God
's
above
,
it
's
involuntary
,
and
I
use
n't
to
use
it
!
I
did
n't
use
*NL*
the
word
`
sir
'
all
my
life
,
but
as
soon
as
I
sank
into
low
water
I
began
*NL*
to
say
`
sir
.
'
It
's
the
work
of
a
higher
power
.
I
see
you
are
interested
in
*NL*
contemporary
questions
,
but
how
can
I
have
excited
your
curiosity
,
living
*NL*
as
I
do
in
surroundings
impossible
for
the
exercise
of
hospitality
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
--
about
that
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
what
business
?
''
the
captain
interrupted
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
your
meeting
with
my
brother
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
Alyosha
blurted
*NL*
out
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
meeting
,
sir
?
You
do
n't
mean
that
meeting
?
About
my
`
wisp
of
tow
,
'
*NL*
then
?
''
He
moved
closer
so
that
his
knees
positively
knocked
against
*NL*
Alyosha
.
His
lips
were
strangely
compressed
like
a
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wisp
of
tow
?
''
muttered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
come
to
complain
of
me
,
father
!
''
cried
a
voice
familiar
to
*NL*
Alyosha
--
the
voice
of
the
schoolboy
--
from
behind
the
curtain
.
``
I
bit
his
*NL*
finger
just
now
.
''
The
curtain
was
pulled
,
and
Alyosha
saw
his
assailant
*NL*
lying
on
a
little
bed
made
up
on
the
bench
and
the
chair
in
the
corner
*NL*
under
the
ikons
.
The
boy
lay
covered
by
his
coat
and
an
old
wadded
quilt
.
*NL*
He
was
evidently
unwell
,
and
,
judging
by
his
glittering
eyes
,
he
was
in
a
*NL*
fever
.
He
looked
at
Alyosha
without
fear
,
as
though
he
felt
he
was
at
home
*NL*
and
could
not
be
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Did
he
bite
your
finger
?
''
The
captain
jumped
up
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
``
Was
it
your
finger
he
bit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
was
throwing
stones
with
other
schoolboys
.
There
were
six
of
them
*NL*
against
him
alone
.
I
went
up
to
him
,
and
he
threw
a
stone
at
me
and
then
*NL*
another
at
my
head
.
I
asked
him
what
I
had
done
to
him
.
And
then
he
rushed
*NL*
at
me
and
bit
my
finger
badly
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
thrash
him
,
sir
,
at
once
--
this
minute
!
''
The
captain
jumped
up
from
*NL*
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
complaining
at
all
,
I
am
simply
telling
you
...
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
him
to
be
thrashed
.
Besides
,
he
seems
to
be
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
suppose
I
'd
thrash
him
?
That
I
'd
take
my
Ilusha
and
thrash
him
*NL*
before
you
for
your
satisfaction
?
Would
you
like
it
done
at
once
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
said
the
captain
,
suddenly
turning
to
Alyosha
,
as
though
he
were
going
to
*NL*
attack
him
.
``
I
am
sorry
about
your
finger
,
sir
;
but
instead
of
thrashing
*NL*
Ilusha
,
would
you
like
me
to
chop
off
my
four
fingers
with
this
knife
here
*NL*
before
your
eyes
to
satisfy
your
just
wrath
?
I
should
think
four
fingers
*NL*
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
your
thirst
for
vengeance
.
You
wo
n't
ask
for
*NL*
the
fifth
one
too
?
''
He
stopped
short
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
.
Every
*NL*
feature
in
his
face
was
twitching
and
working
;
he
looked
extremely
*NL*
defiant
.
He
was
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
understand
it
all
now
,
''
said
Alyosha
gently
and
sorrowfully
,
*NL*
still
keeping
his
seat
.
``
So
your
boy
is
a
good
boy
,
he
loves
his
father
,
*NL*
and
he
attacked
me
as
the
brother
of
your
assailant
...
Now
I
understand
*NL*
it
,
''
he
repeated
thoughtfully
.
``
But
my
brother
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
regrets
*NL*
his
action
,
I
know
that
,
and
if
only
it
is
possible
for
him
to
come
to
*NL*
you
,
or
better
still
,
to
meet
you
in
that
same
place
,
he
will
ask
your
*NL*
forgiveness
before
every
one
--
if
you
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
pulling
out
my
beard
,
you
mean
,
he
will
ask
my
forgiveness
?
And
he
*NL*
thinks
that
will
be
a
satisfactory
finish

does
n't
he
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
So

tavern

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``
You

Touched

pierced

heart

I
am
only

sensible

Allow

``
Ah

perfectly
true

exclaimed
Alyosha

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
leave
off
playing
the
fool

cried
the
girl
by
the
window
,
suddenly
turning
to
her
father
with
*NL*
a
disdainful
and
contemptuous
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

cried
her
father

speaking
peremptorily
but
*NL*
looking
at
her
quite
approvingly

``
That

her
character

he
said
,
*NL*
addressing
Alyosha
again

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in

Fyodorovitch

He
took
him
by
the
hand
and
with
unexpected
*NL*
force
pulled
him
up

``
You
must
stand
up
to

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
kissed
his
wife

hand
respectfully
and
even
tenderly
.
The
girl
at
*NL*
the
window
turned
her
back
indignantly
on
the
scene
;
an
expression
of
*NL*
extraordinary
cordiality
came
over
the
haughtily
inquiring
face

woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

Karamazov
,
or
whatever
it
is
,
but
I
always
think
of
*NL*
Tchernomazov
...
Sit
down
.
Why
has
he
pulled
you
up
?
He
calls
me
crippled
,
*NL*
but
I
am
not
,
only
my
legs
are
swollen
like
barrels
,
and
I
am
shriveled
up
*NL*
myself
.
Once
I
used
to
be
so
fat
,
but
now
it
's
as
though
I
had
swallowed
a
*NL*
needle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
of
humble
origin
,
''
the
captain
muttered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
father
!
''
the
hunchback
girl
,
who
had
till
then
been
silent
on
*NL*
her
chair
,
said
suddenly
,
and
she
hid
her
eyes
in
her
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buffoon
!
''
blurted
out
the
girl
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
our
news
?
''
said
the
mother
,
pointing
at
her
daughters
.
*NL*
``
It
's
like
clouds
coming
over
;
the
clouds
pass
and
we
have
music
again
.
*NL*
When
we
were
with
the
army
,
we
used
to
have
many
such
guests
.
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
make
any
comparisons
;
every
one
to
their
taste
.
The
deacon
's
wife
used
*NL*
to
come
then
and
say
,
`
Alexandr
Alexandrovitch
is
a
man
of
the
noblest
*NL*
heart
,
but
Nastasya
Petrovna
,
'
she
would
say
,
`
is
of
the
brood
of
hell
.
'
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
I
said
,
`
that
's
a
matter
of
taste
;
but
you
are
a
little
spitfire
.
'
*NL*
`
And
you
want
keeping
in
your
place
,
'
says
she
.
`
You
black
sword
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
who
asked
you
to
teach
me
?
'
`
But
my
breath
,
'
says
she
,
`
is
clean
,
and
*NL*
yours
is
unclean
.
'
`
You
ask
all
the
officers
whether
my
breath
is
*NL*
unclean
.
'
And
ever
since
then
I
had
it
in
my
mind
.
Not
long
ago
I
was
*NL*
sitting
here
as
I
am
now
,
when
I
saw
that
very
general
come
in
who
came
*NL*
here
for
Easter
,
and
I
asked
him
:
`
Your
Excellency
,
'
said
I
,
`
can
a
lady
's
*NL*
breath
be
unpleasant
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
he
answered
;
`
you
ought
to
open
a
window
-
*NL*
pane
or
open
the
door
,
for
the
air
is
not
fresh
here
.
'
And
they
all
go
on
*NL*
like
that
!
And
what
is
my
breath
to
them
?
The
dead
smell
worse
still
!
'
I
*NL*
wo
n't
spoil
the
air
,
'
said
I
,
`
I
'll
order
some
slippers
and
go
away
.
'
My
*NL*
darlings
,
do
n't
blame
your
own
mother
!
Nikolay
Ilyitch
,
how
is
it
I
ca
n't
*NL*
please
you
?
There
's
only
Ilusha
who
comes
home
from
school
and
loves
me
.
*NL*
Yesterday
he
brought
me
an
apple
.
Forgive
your
own
mother
--
forgive
a
poor
*NL*
lonely
creature
!
Why
has
my
breath
become
unpleasant
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
poor
mad
woman
broke
into
sobs
,
and
tears
streamed
down
her
*NL*
cheeks
.
The
captain
rushed
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
mamma
,
my
dear
,
give
over
!
You
are
not
lonely
.
Every
one
loves
*NL*
you
,
every
one
adores
you
.
''
He
began
kissing
both
her
hands
again
and
*NL*
tenderly
stroking
her
face
;
taking
the
dinner-napkin
,
he
began
wiping
away
*NL*
her
tears
.
Alyosha
fancied
that
he
too
had
tears
in
his
eyes
.
``
There
,
you
*NL*
see
,
you
hear
?
''
he
turned
with
a
sort
of
fury
to
Alyosha
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
poor
imbecile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
and
hear
,
''
muttered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
father
,
how
can
you
--
with
him
!
Let
him
alone
!
''
cried
the
boy
,
*NL*
sitting
up
in
his
bed
and
gazing
at
his
father
with
glowing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
give
over
fooling
,
showing
off
your
silly
antics
which
never
lead
to
*NL*
anything
!
''
shouted
Varvara
,
stamping
her
foot
with
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
anger
is
quite
just
this
time
,
Varvara
,
and
I
'll
make
haste
to
*NL*
satisfy
you

Come
,
put
on
your
cap
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
and
I
'll
put
on
*NL*
mine
.
We
will
go
out
.
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
in
earnest
,
but
not
*NL*
within
these
walls
.
This
girl
sitting
here
is
my
daughter
Nina
;
I
forgot
*NL*
to
introduce
her
to
you
.
She
is
a
heavenly
angel
incarnate
...
who
has
*NL*
flown
down
to
us
mortals
,
...
if
you
can
understand

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
shaking
all
over

as
though
he
is
in
convulsions

Varvara
*NL*
went
on
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
there
stamping
her
foot
at
me
and
calling
me
a
fool
just
now
,
she
*NL*
is
a
heavenly
angel
incarnate
too

and
she
has
good
reason
to
call
me
so

*NL*
Come
along
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
we
must
make
an
end

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
snatching
Alyosha
's
hand
,
he
drew
him
out
of
the
room
into
the
*NL*
street

Chapter
VII
.
And
In
The
Open
Air
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
air
is
fresh
,
but
in
my
apartment
it
is
not
so
in
any
sense
of
the
*NL*
word
.
Let
us
walk
slowly
,
sir
.
I
should
be
glad
of
your
kind
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
too
have
something
important
to
say
to
you
,
''
observed
Alyosha
,
``
only
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
you
must
have
business
with
me
.
You
would
never
have
looked
in
*NL*
upon
me
without
some
object
.
Unless
you
come
simply
to
complain
of
the
*NL*
boy
,
and
that
's
hardly
likely
.
And
,
by
the
way
,
about
the
boy
:
I
could
not
*NL*
explain
to
you
in
there
,
but
here
I
will
describe
that
scene
to
you
.
My
*NL*
tow
was
thicker
a
week
ago
--
I
mean
my
beard
.
That
's
the
nickname
they
give
*NL*
to
my
beard
,
the
schoolboys
most
of
all
.
Well
,
your
brother
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
was
pulling
me
by
my
beard
,
I
'd
done
nothing
,
he
was
in
a
*NL*
towering
rage
and
happened
to
come
upon
me
.
He
dragged
me
out
of
the
*NL*
tavern
into
the
market-place
;
at
that
moment
the
boys
were
coming
out
of
*NL*
school
,
and
with
them
Ilusha
.
As
soon
as
he
saw
me
in
such
a
state
he
*NL*
rushed
up
to
me
.
`
Father
,
'
he
cried
,
`
father
!
'
He
caught
hold
of
me
,
*NL*
hugged
me
,
tried
to
pull
me
away
,
crying
to
my
assailant
,
`
Let
go
,
let
go
,
*NL*
it
's
my
father
,
forgive
him
!
'
--
yes
,
he
actually
cried
`
forgive
him
.
'
He
*NL*
clutched
at
that
hand
,
that
very
hand
,
in
his
little
hands
and
kissed
*NL*
it
...
I
remember
his
little
face
at
that
moment
,
I
have
n't
forgotten
it
*NL*
and
I
never
shall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
,
''
cried
Alyosha
,
``
that
my
brother
will
express
his
most
deep
and
*NL*
sincere
regret
,
even
if
he
has
to
go
down
on
his
knees
in
that
same
*NL*
market-place
...
I
'll
make
him
or
he
is
no
brother
of
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
,
then
it
's
only
a
suggestion
!
And
it
does
not
come
from
him
but
*NL*
simply
from
the
generosity
of
your
own
warm
heart
.
You
should
have
said
*NL*
so
.
No
,
in
that
case
allow
me
to
tell
you
of
your
brother
's
highly
*NL*
chivalrous
soldierly
generosity
,
for
he
did
give
expression
to
it
at
the
*NL*
time
.
He
left
off
dragging
me
by
my
beard
and
released
me
:
`
You
are
an
*NL*
officer
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
I
am
an
officer
,
if
you
can
find
a
decent
man
to
*NL*
be
your
second
send
me
your
challenge
.
I
will
give
satisfaction
,
though
*NL*
you
are
a
scoundrel
.
'
That
's
what
he
said
.
A
chivalrous
spirit
indeed
!
I
*NL*
retired
with
Ilusha
,
and
that
scene
is
a
family
record
imprinted
for
ever
*NL*
on
Ilusha
's
soul
.
No
,
it
's
not
for
us
to
claim
the
privileges
of
noblemen
.
*NL*
Judge
for
yourself
.
You
've
just
been
in
our
mansion
,
what
did
you
see
*NL*
there
?
Three
ladies
,
one
a
cripple
and
weak-minded
,
another
a
cripple
and
*NL*
hunchback
and
the
third
not
crippled
but
far
too
clever
.
She
is
a
student
,
*NL*
dying
to
get
back
to
Petersburg
,
to
work
for
the
emancipation
of
the
*NL*
Russian
woman
on
the
banks
of
the
Neva
.
I
wo
n't
speak
of
Ilusha
,
he
is
*NL*
only
nine
.
I
am
alone
in
the
world
,
and
if
I
die
,
what
will
become
of
all
*NL*
of
them
?
I
simply
ask
you
that
.
And
if
I
challenge
him
and
he
kills
me
on
*NL*
the
spot
,
what
then
?
What
will
become
of
them
?
And
worse
still
,
if
he
*NL*
does
n't
kill
me
but
only
cripples
me
:
I
could
n't
work
,
but
I
should
still
*NL*
be
a
mouth
to
feed
.
Who
would
feed
it
and
who
would
feed
them
all
?
Must
I
*NL*
take
Ilusha
from
school
and
send
him
to
beg
in
the
streets
?
That
's
what
it
*NL*
means
for
me
to
challenge
him
to
a
duel
.
It
's
silly
talk
and
nothing
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
beg
your
forgiveness
,
he
will
bow
down
at
your
feet
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
market-place
,
''
cried
Alyosha
again
,
with
glowing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
think
of
prosecuting
him
,
''
the
captain
went
on
,
``
but
look
in
our
*NL*
code
,
could
I
get
much
compensation
for
a
personal
injury
?
And
then
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
sent
for
me
and
shouted
at
me
:
`
Do
n't
dare
to
*NL*
dream
of
it
!
If
you
proceed
against
him
,
I
'll
publish
it
to
all
the
world
*NL*
that
he
beat
you
for
your
dishonesty
,
and
then
you
will
be
prosecuted
.
'
I
*NL*
call
God
to
witness
whose
was
the
dishonesty
and
by
whose
commands
I
*NL*
acted
,
was
n't
it
by
her
own
and
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
?
`
And
what
's
more
,
'
*NL*
she
went
on
,
`
I
'll
dismiss
you
for
good
and
you
'll
never
earn
another
*NL*
penny
from
me
.
I
'll
speak
to
my
merchant
too
'
-LRB-
that
's
what
she
calls
her
*NL*
old
man
-RRB-
`
and
he
will
dismiss
you
!
'
And
if
he
dismisses
me
,
what
can
I
*NL*
earn
then
from
any
one
?
Those
two
are
all
I
have
to
look
to
,
for
your
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
has
not
only
given
over
employing
me
,
for
another
*NL*
reason
,
but
he
means
to
make
use
of
papers
I
've
signed
to
go
to
law
*NL*
against
me
.
And
so
I
kept
quiet
,
and
you
have
seen
our
retreat
.
But
now
*NL*
let
me
ask
you
:
did
Ilusha
hurt
your
finger
much
?
I
did
n't
like
to
go
into
*NL*
it
in
our
mansion
before
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
,
and
he
was
in
a
great
fury
.
He
was
avenging
you
on
me
as
*NL*
a
Karamazov
,
I
see
that
now
.
But
if
only
you
had
seen
how
he
was
throwing
*NL*
stones
at
his
school-fellows
!
It
's
very
dangerous
.
They
might
kill
him
.
*NL*
They
are
children
and
stupid
.
A
stone
may
be
thrown
and
break
somebody
's
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
has
happened
.
He
has
been
bruised
by
a
stone
to-day
.
Not
*NL*
on
the
head
but
on
the
chest
,
just
above
the
heart
.
He
came
home
crying
*NL*
and
groaning
and
now
he
is
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
he
attacks
them
first
.
He
is
bitter
against
them
on
your
*NL*
account
.
They
say
he
stabbed
a
boy
called
Krassotkin
with
a
pen-knife
not
*NL*
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
about
that
too

it
's
dangerous

Krassotkin
is
an
official
*NL*
here

may
hear
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
advise
you
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
warmly
,
``
not
to
send
him
to
school
*NL*
at
all
for
a
time
till
he
is
calmer
...
and
his
anger
is
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anger
!
''
the
captain
repeated
,
``
that
's
just
what
it
is
.
He
is
a
little
*NL*
creature
,
but
it
's
a
mighty
anger
.
You
do
n't
know
all
,
sir
.
Let
me
tell
*NL*
you
more
.
Since
that
incident
all
the
boys
have
been
teasing
him
about
the
*NL*
`
wisp
of
tow
.
'
Schoolboys
are
a
merciless
race
,
individually
they
are
*NL*
angels
,
but
together
,
especially
in
schools
,
they
are
often
merciless
.
*NL*
Their
teasing
has
stirred
up
a
gallant
spirit
in
Ilusha
.
An
ordinary
boy
,
*NL*
a
weak
son
,
would
have
submitted
,
have
felt
ashamed
of
his
father
,
sir
,
*NL*
but
he
stood
up
for
his
father
against
them
all
.
For
his
father
and
for
*NL*
truth
and
justice
.
For
what
he
suffered
when
he
kissed
your
brother
's
hand
*NL*
and
cried
to
him
`
Forgive
father
,
forgive
him
,
'
--
that
only
God
knows
--
and
I
,
*NL*
his
father
.
For
our
children
--
not
your
children
,
but
ours
--
the
children
of
*NL*
the
poor
gentlemen
looked
down
upon
by
every
one
--
know
what
justice
means
,
*NL*
sir
,
even
at
nine
years
old
.
How
should
the
rich
know
?
They
do
n't
explore
*NL*
such
depths
once
in
their
lives
.
But
at
that
moment
in
the
square
when
he
*NL*
kissed
his
hand
,
at
that
moment
my
Ilusha
had
grasped
all
that
justice
*NL*
means
.
That
truth
entered
into
him
and
crushed
him
for
ever
,
sir
,
''
the
*NL*
captain
said
hotly
again
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
,
and
he
struck
his
right
*NL*
fist
against
his
left
palm
as
though
he
wanted
to
show
how
``
the
truth
''
*NL*
crushed
Ilusha
.
``
That
very
day
,
sir
,
he
fell
ill
with
fever
and
was
*NL*
delirious
all
night
.
All
that
day
he
hardly
said
a
word
to
me
,
but
I
*NL*
noticed
he
kept
watching
me
from
the
corner
,
though
he
turned
to
the
*NL*
window
and
pretended
to
be
learning
his
lessons
.
But
I
could
see
his
mind
*NL*
was
not
on
his
lessons
.
Next
day
I
got
drunk
to
forget
my
troubles
,
sinful
*NL*
man
as
I
am
,
and
I
do
n't
remember
much
.
Mamma
began
crying
,
too
--
I
am
very
*NL*
fond
of
mamma
--
well
,
I
spent
my
last
penny
drowning
my
troubles
.
Do
n't
*NL*
despise
me
for
that
,
sir
,
in
Russia
men
who
drink
are
the
best
.
The
best
*NL*
men
amongst
us
are
the
greatest
drunkards
.
I
lay
down
and
I
do
n't
remember
*NL*
about
Ilusha
,
though
all
that
day
the
boys
had
been
jeering
at
him
at
*NL*
school
.
`
Wisp
of
tow
,
'
they
shouted
,
`
your
father
was
pulled
out
of
the
*NL*
tavern
by
his
wisp
of
tow
,
you
ran
by
and
begged
forgiveness
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
third
day
when
he
came
back
from
school
,
I
saw
he
looked
pale
and
*NL*
wretched
.
`
What
is
it
?
'
I
asked
.
He
would
n't
answer
.
Well
,
there
's
no
*NL*
talking
in
our
mansion
without
mamma
and
the
girls
taking
part
in
it
.
*NL*
What
's
more
,
the
girls
had
heard
about
it
the
very
first
day
.
Varvara
had
*NL*
begun
snarling
.
`
You
fools
and
buffoons
,
can
you
ever
do
anything
*NL*
rational
?
'
`
Quite
so
,
'
I
said
,
`
can
we
ever
do
anything
rational
?
'
For
the
*NL*
time
I
turned
it
off
like
that
.
So
in
the
evening
I
took
the
boy
out
for
a
*NL*
walk
,
for
you
must
know
we
go
for
a
walk
every
evening
,
always
the
same
*NL*
way
,
along
which
we
are
going
now
--
from
our
gate
to
that
great
stone
which
*NL*
lies
alone
in
the
road
under
the
hurdle
,
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
town
pasture
.
A
beautiful
and
lonely
spot
,
sir
.
Ilusha
and
I
walked
along
*NL*
hand
in
hand
as
usual
.
He
has
a
little
hand
,
his
fingers
are
thin
and
*NL*
cold
--
he
suffers
with
his
chest
,
you
know
.
`
Father
,
'
said
he
,
`
father
!
'
*NL*
`
Well
?
'
said
I.
I
saw
his
eyes
flashing
.
`
Father
,
how
he
treated
you
*NL*
then
!
'
`
It
ca
n't
be
helped
,
Ilusha
,
'
I
said
.
`
Do
n't
forgive
him
,
father
,
*NL*
do
n't
forgive
him
!
At
school
they
say
that
he
has
paid
you
ten
roubles
for
*NL*
it
.
'
`
No
,
Ilusha
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
would
not
take
money
from
him
for
anything
.
'
*NL*
Then
he
began
trembling
all
over
,
took
my
hand
in
both
his
and
kissed
it
*NL*
again
.
`
Father
,
'
he
said
,
`
father
,
challenge
him
to
a
duel
,
at
school
they
*NL*
say
you
are
a
coward
and
wo
n't
challenge
him
,
and
that
you
'll
accept
ten
*NL*
roubles
from
him
.
'
'
I
ca
n't
challenge
him
to
a
duel
,
Ilusha
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
And
I
told
briefly
what
I
've
just
told
you
.
He
listened
.
`
Father
,
'
he
*NL*
said
,
`
anyway
do
n't
forgive
it
.
When
I
grow
up
I
'll
call
him
out
myself
*NL*
and
kill
him
.
'
His
eyes
shone
and
glowed
.
And
of
course
I
am
his
father
,
*NL*
and
I
had
to
put
in
a
word
:
`
It
's
a
sin
to
kill
,
'
I
said
,
`
even
in
a
*NL*
duel
.
'
`
Father
,
'
he
said
,
`
when
I
grow
up
,
I
'll
knock
him
down
,
knock
the
*NL*
sword
out
of
his
hand
,
I
'll
fall
on
him
,
wave
my
sword
over
him
and
say
:
*NL*
``
I
could
kill
you
,
but
I
forgive
you
,
so
there
!
''
'
You
see
what
the
*NL*
workings
of
his
little
mind
have
been
during
these
two
days
;
he
must
have
*NL*
been
planning
that
vengeance
all
day
,
and
raving
about
it
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
began
to
come
home
from
school
badly
beaten
,
I
found
out
about
it
*NL*
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
you
are
right
,
I
wo
n't
send
him
to
that
*NL*
school
any
more
.
I
heard
that
he
was
standing
up
against
all
the
class
*NL*
alone
and
defying
them
all
,
that
his
heart
was
full
of
resentment
,
of
*NL*
bitterness
--
I
was
alarmed
about
him
.
We
went
for
another
walk
.
`
Father
,
'
he
*NL*
asked
,
`
are
the
rich
people
stronger
than
any
one
else
on
earth
?
'
`
Yes
,
*NL*
Ilusha
,
'
I
said
,
`
there
are
no
people
on
earth
stronger
than
the
rich
.
'
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
he
said
,
'
I
will
get
rich
,
I
will
become
an
officer
and
conquer
*NL*
everybody
.
The
Tsar
will
reward
me
,
I
will
come
back
here
and
then
no
one
*NL*
will
dare
--
'
Then
he
was
silent
and
his
lips
still
kept
trembling
.
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
he
said
,
`
what
a
horrid
town
this
is
.
'
`
Yes
,
Ilusha
,
'
I
said
,
*NL*
`
it
is
n't
a
very
nice
town
.
'
`
Father
,
let
us
move
into
another
town
,
a
*NL*
nice
one
,
'
he
said
,
`
where
people
do
n't
know
about
us
.
'
`
We
will
move
,
we
*NL*
will
,
Ilusha
,
'
said
I
,
`
only
I
must
save
up
for
it
.
'
I
was
glad
to
be
able
*NL*
to
turn
his
mind
from
painful
thoughts
,
and
we
began
to
dream
of
how
we
*NL*
would
move
to
another
town
,
how
we
would
buy
a
horse
and
cart
.
`
We
will
*NL*
put
mamma
and
your
sisters
inside
,
we
will
cover
them
up
and
we
'll
walk
,
*NL*
you
shall
have
a
lift
now
and
then
,
and
I
'll
walk
beside
,
for
we
must
take
*NL*
care
of
our
horse
,
we
ca
n't
all
ride
.
That
's
how
we
'll
go
.
'
He
was
*NL*
enchanted
at
that
,
most
of
all
at
the
thought
of
having
a
horse
and
*NL*
driving
him
.
For
of
course
a
Russian
boy
is
born
among
horses
.
We
*NL*
chattered
a
long
while
.
Thank
God
,
I
thought
,
I
have
diverted
his
mind
and
*NL*
comforted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
the
day
before
yesterday
,
in
the
evening
,
but
last
night
*NL*
everything
was
changed
.
He
had
gone
to
school
in
the
morning
,
he
came
back
*NL*
depressed
,
terribly
depressed
.
In
the
evening
I
took
him
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
we
went
for
a
walk
;
he
would
not
talk
.
There
was
a
wind
blowing
and
no
*NL*
sun
,
and
a
feeling
of
autumn
;
twilight
was
coming
on
.
We
walked
along
,
*NL*
both
of
us
depressed
.
`
Well
,
my
boy
,
'
said
I
,
`
how
about
our
setting
off
*NL*
on
our
travels
?
'
I
thought
I
might
bring
him
back
to
our
talk
of
the
day
*NL*
before
.
He
did
n't
answer
,
but
I
felt
his
fingers
trembling
in
my
hand
.
Ah
,
*NL*
I
thought
,
it
's
a
bad
job
;
there
's
something
fresh
.
We
had
reached
the
*NL*
stone
where
we
are
now
.
I
sat
down
on
the
stone
.
And
in
the
air
there
were
*NL*
lots
of
kites
flapping
and
whirling
.
There
were
as
many
as
thirty
in
*NL*
sight
.
Of
course
,
it
's
just
the
season
for
the
kites
.
`
Look
,
Ilusha
,
'
said
*NL*
I
,
`
it
's
time
we
got
out
our
last
year
's
kite
again
.
I
'll
mend
it
,
where
*NL*
have
you
put
it
away
?
'
My
boy
made
no
answer
.
He
looked
away
and
turned
*NL*
sideways
to
me
.
And
then
a
gust
of
wind
blew
up
the
sand
.
He
suddenly
fell
*NL*
on
me
,
threw
both
his
little
arms
round
my
neck
and
held
me
tight
.
You
*NL*
know
,
when
children
are
silent
and
proud
,
and
try
to
keep
back
their
tears
*NL*
when
they
are
in
great
trouble
and
suddenly
break
down
,
their
tears
fall
*NL*
in
streams
.
With
those
warm
streams
of
tears
,
he
suddenly
wetted
my
face
.
*NL*
He
sobbed
and
shook
as
though
he
were
in
convulsions
,
and
squeezed
up
*NL*
against
me
as
I
sat
on
the
stone
.
`
Father
,
'
he
kept
crying
,
`
dear
father
,
*NL*
how
he
insulted
you
!
'
And
I
sobbed
too
.
We
sat
shaking
in
each
other
's
*NL*
arms
.
`
Ilusha
,
'
I
said
to
him
,
`
Ilusha
darling
.
'
No
one
saw
us
then
.
God
*NL*
alone
saw
us
,
I
hope
He
will
record
it
to
my
credit
.
You
must
thank
your
*NL*
brother
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
No
,
sir
,
I
wo
n't
thrash
my
boy
for
your
*NL*
satisfaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
gone
back
to
his
original
tone
of
resentful
buffoonery
.
Alyosha
*NL*
felt
though
that
he
trusted
him
,
and
that
if
there
had
been
some
one
else
*NL*
in
his
,
Alyosha
's
place
,
the
man
would
not
have
spoken
so
openly
and
would
*NL*
not
have
told
what
he
had
just
told
.
This
encouraged
Alyosha
,
whose
heart
*NL*
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
I
would
like
to
make
friends
with
your
boy
!
''
he
cried
.
``
If
you
*NL*
could
arrange
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir
,
''
muttered
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
listen
to
something
quite
different
!
''
Alyosha
went
on
.
``
I
have
a
*NL*
message
for
you
.
That
same
brother
of
mine
,
Dmitri
,
has
insulted
his
*NL*
betrothed
,
too
,
a
noble-hearted
girl
of
whom
you
have
probably
heard
.
I
*NL*
have
a
right
to
tell
you
of
her
wrong
;
I
ought
to
do
so
,
in
fact
,
for
*NL*
hearing
of
the
insult
done
to
you
and
learning
all
about
your
unfortunate
*NL*
position
,
she
commissioned
me
at
once
--
just
now
--
to
bring
you
this
help
from
*NL*
her
--
but
only
from
her
alone
,
not
from
Dmitri
,
who
has
abandoned
her
.
Nor
*NL*
from
me
,
his
brother
,
nor
from
any
one
else
,
but
from
her
,
only
from
her
!
*NL*
She
entreats
you
to
accept
her
help
...
You
have
both
been
insulted
by
the
*NL*
same
man
.
She
thought
of
you
only
when
she
had
just
received
a
similar
*NL*
insult
from
him
--
similar
in
its
cruelty
,
I
mean
.
She
comes
like
a
sister
to
*NL*
help
a
brother
in
misfortune
...
She
told
me
to
persuade
you
to
take
these
*NL*
two
hundred
roubles
from
her
,
as
from
a
sister
,
knowing
that
you
are
in
*NL*
such
need
.
No
one
will
know
of
it
,
it
can
give
rise
to
no
unjust
slander
.
*NL*
There
are
the
two
hundred
roubles
,
and
I
swear
you
must
take
them
*NL*
unless
--
unless
all
men
are
to
be
enemies
on
earth
!
But
there
are
brothers
*NL*
even
on
earth
...
You
have
a
generous
heart
...
you
must
see
that
,
you
*NL*
must

''
and
Alyosha
held
out
two
new
rainbow-colored
hundred-rouble
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
standing
at
the
time
by
the
great
stone
close
to
the
fence
,
*NL*
and
there
was
no
one
near
.
The
notes
seemed
to
produce
a
tremendous
*NL*
impression
on
the
captain
.
He
started
,
but
at
first
only
from
*NL*
astonishment
.
Such
an
outcome
of
their
conversation
was
the
last
thing
he
*NL*
expected
.
Nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
his
dreams
than
help
from
*NL*
any
one
--
and
such
a
sum
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
notes
,
and
for
a
minute
he
was
almost
unable
to
answer
,
quite
*NL*
a
new
expression
came
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
for
me
?
So
much
money
--
two
hundred
roubles
!
Good
heavens
!
Why
,
I
*NL*
have
n't
seen
so
much
money
for
the
last
four
years
!
Mercy
on
us
!
And
she
*NL*
says
she
is
a
sister
...
And
is
that
the
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
that
all
I
told
you
is
the
truth
,

cried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
flushed
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
my
dear
,
listen

If
I
take
it

Alexey

he
hurried
,
touching
Alyosha
with
*NL*
both
his
hands
.
``
You
are
persuading
me
to
take
it

saying
that

it

,
in
your
heart
wo
n't
you
feel
contempt
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

no

Never

at
a
moment
like
this
*NL*
you
must
listen
,
for
you
ca
n't
understand
what
these
two
hundred
roubles
*NL*
mean
to
me
now
.
''
The
poor
fellow
went
on
rising
gradually
into
a
sort
of
*NL*
incoherent
,
almost
wild
enthusiasm
.
He
was
thrown
off
his
balance
and
*NL*
talked
extremely
fast
,
as
though
afraid
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
say
all
*NL*
he
had
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
its
being
honestly
acquired
from
a
`
sister
,
'
so
highly
respected
*NL*
and
revered
,
do
you
know
that
now
I
can
look
after
mamma
and
Nina
,
my
*NL*
hunchback
angel
daughter
?
Doctor
Herzenstube
came
to
me
in
the
kindness
of
*NL*
his
heart
and
was
examining
them
both
for
a
whole
hour
.
'
I
can
make
*NL*
nothing
of
it
,
'
said
he
,
but
he
prescribed
a
mineral
water
which
is
kept
*NL*
at
a
chemist
's
here
.
He
said
it
would
be
sure
to
do
her
good
,
and
he
*NL*
ordered
baths
,
too
,
with
some
medicine
in
them
.
The
mineral
water
costs
*NL*
thirty
copecks
,
and
she
'd
need
to
drink
forty
bottles
perhaps
;
so
I
took
*NL*
the
prescription
and
laid
it
on
the
shelf
under
the
ikons
,
and
there
it
*NL*
lies
.
And
he
ordered
hot
baths
for
Nina
with
something
dissolved
in
them
,
*NL*
morning
and
evening
.
But
how
can
we
carry
out
such
a
cure
in
our
mansion
,
*NL*
without
servants
,
without
help
,
without
a
bath
,
and
without
water
?
Nina
is
*NL*
rheumatic
all
over
,
I
do
n't
think
I
told
you
that
.
All
her
right
side
*NL*
aches
at
night
,
she
is
in
agony
,
and
,
would
you
believe
it
,
the
angel
*NL*
bears
it
without
groaning
for
fear
of
waking
us
.
We
eat
what
we
can
get
,
*NL*
and
she
'll
only
take
the
leavings
,
what
you
'd
scarcely
give
to
a
dog
.
'
I
*NL*
am
not
worth
it
,
I
am
taking
it
from
you
,
I
am
a
burden
on
you
,
'
that
's
*NL*
what
her
angel
eyes
try
to
express
.
We
wait
on
her
,
but
she
does
n't
like
*NL*
it
.
'
I
am
a
useless
cripple
,
no
good
to
any
one
.
'
As
though
she
were
not
*NL*
worth
it
,
when
she
is
the
saving
of
all
of
us
with
her
angelic
sweetness
.
*NL*
Without
her
,
without
her
gentle
word
it
would
be
hell
among
us
!
She
*NL*
softens
even
Varvara
.
And
do
n't
judge
Varvara
harshly
either
,
she
is
an
*NL*
angel
too
,
she
,
too
,
has
suffered
wrong
.
She
came
to
us
for
the
summer
,
*NL*
and
she
brought
sixteen
roubles
she
had
earned
by
lessons
and
saved
up
,
to
*NL*
go
back
with
to
Petersburg
in
September
,
that
is
now
.
But
we
took
her
*NL*
money
and
lived
on
it
,
so
now
she
has
nothing
to
go
back
with
.
Though
*NL*
indeed
she
could
n't
go
back
,
for
she
has
to
work
for
us
like
a
slave
.
She
*NL*
is
like
an
overdriven
horse
with
all
of
us
on
her
back
.
She
waits
on
us
*NL*
all
,
mends
and
washes
,
sweeps
the
floor
,
puts
mamma
to
bed
.
And
mamma
is
*NL*
capricious
and
tearful
and
insane
!
And
now
I
can
get
a
servant
with
this
*NL*
money
,
you
understand
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
I
can
get
medicines
for
the
*NL*
dear
creatures
,
I
can
send
my
student
to
Petersburg
,
I
can
buy
beef
,
I
can
*NL*
feed
them
properly
.
Good
Lord
,
but
it
's
a
dream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
delighted
that
he
had
brought
him
such
happiness
and
that
the
*NL*
poor
fellow
had
consented
to
be
made
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
stay
,
''
the
captain
began
to
talk
with
frenzied
*NL*
rapidity
,
carried
away
by
a
new
day-dream
.
``
Do
you
know
that
Ilusha
and
I
*NL*
will
perhaps
really
carry
out
our
dream
.
We
will
buy
a
horse
and
cart
,
a
*NL*
black
horse
,
he
insists
on
its
being
black
,
and
we
will
set
off
as
we
*NL*
pretended
the
other
day
.
I
have
an
old
friend
,
a
lawyer
in
K.
province
,
*NL*
and
I
heard
through
a
trustworthy
man
that
if
I
were
to
go
he
'd
give
me
a
*NL*
place
as
clerk
in
his
office
,
so
,
who
knows
,
maybe
he
would
.
So
I
'd
just
*NL*
put
mamma
and
Nina
in
the
cart
,
and
Ilusha
could
drive
,
and
I
'd
walk
,
I
'd
*NL*
walk
...
Why
,
if
I
only
succeed
in
getting
one
debt
paid
that
's
owing
me
,
*NL*
I
should
have
perhaps
enough
for
that
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
would
be
enough
!
''
cried
Alyosha
.
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
will
send
you
*NL*
as
much
more
as
you
need
,
and
you
know
,
I
have
money
too
,
take
what
you
*NL*
want
,
as
you
would
from
a
brother
,
from
a
friend
,
you
can
give
it
back
*NL*
later
...
-LRB-
You
'll
get
rich
,
you
'll
get
rich
!
-RRB-
And
you
know
you
could
n't
*NL*
have
a
better
idea
than
to
move
to
another
province
!
It
would
be
the
*NL*
saving
of
you
,
especially
of
your
boy
--
and
you
ought
to
go
quickly
,
before
*NL*
the
winter
,
before
the
cold
.
You
must
write
to
us
when
you
are
there
,
and
*NL*
we
will
always
be
brothers
...
No
,
it
's
not
a
dream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
could
have
hugged
him
,
he
was
so
pleased
.
But
glancing
at
him
he
*NL*
stopped
short
.
The
man
was
standing
with
his
neck
outstretched
and
his
*NL*
lips
protruding
,
with
a
pale
and
frenzied
face
.
His
lips
were
moving
as
*NL*
though
trying
to
articulate
something
;
no
sound
came
,
but
still
his
lips
*NL*
moved
.
It
was
uncanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Alyosha
,
startled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
...
I
...
you
,
''
muttered
the
captain
,
faltering
,
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
,
wild
,
fixed
stare
,
and
an
air
of
desperate
*NL*
resolution
.
At
the
same
time
there
was
a
sort
of
grin
on
his
lips
.
``
I
...
*NL*
you
,
sir
...
would
n't
you
like
me
to
show
you
a
little
trick
I
know
?
''
he
*NL*
murmured
,
suddenly
,
in
a
firm
rapid
whisper
,
his
voice
no
longer
*NL*
faltering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
trick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
trick
,
''
whispered
the
captain
.
His
mouth
was
twisted
on
the
left
*NL*
side
,
his
left
eye
was
screwed
up
.
He
still
stared
at
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
What
trick
?
''
Alyosha
cried
,
now
thoroughly
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
look
,
''
squealed
the
captain
suddenly
,
and
showing
him
the
two
notes
*NL*
which
he
had
been
holding
by
one
corner
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
*NL*
during
the
conversation
,
he
crumpled
them
up
savagely
and
squeezed
them
*NL*
tight
in
his
right
hand
.
``
Do
you
see
,
do
you
see
?
''
he
shrieked
,
pale
and
*NL*
infuriated
.
And
suddenly
flinging
up
his
hand
,
he
threw
the
crumpled
notes
*NL*
on
the
sand
.
``
Do
you
see
?
''
he
shrieked
again
,
pointing
to
them
.
``
Look
*NL*
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
wild
fury
he
began
trampling
them
under
his
heel
,
gasping
and
*NL*
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
for
your
money
!
So
much
for
your
money
!
So
much
for
your
money
!
*NL*
So
much
for
your
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
darted
back
and
drew
himself
up
before
Alyosha
,
and
his
whole
*NL*
figure
expressed
unutterable
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
those
who
sent
you
that
the
wisp
of
tow
does
not
sell
his
honor
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
raising
his
arm
in
the
air
.
Then
he
turned
quickly
and
began
to
*NL*
run
;
but
he
had
not
run
five
steps
before
he
turned
completely
round
and
*NL*
kissed
his
hand
to
Alyosha
.
He
ran
another
five
paces
and
then
turned
*NL*
round
for
the
last
time
.
This
time
his
face
was
not
contorted
with
*NL*
laughter
,
but
quivering
all
over
with
tears
.
In
a
tearful
,
faltering
,
*NL*
sobbing
voice
he
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
say
to
my
boy
if
I
took
money
from
you
for
our
shame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
ran
on
without
turning
.
Alyosha
looked
after
him
,
*NL*
inexpressibly
grieved
.
Oh
,
he
saw
that
till
the
very
last
moment
the
man
*NL*
had
not
known
he
would
crumple
up
and
fling
away
the
notes
.
He
did
not
*NL*
turn
back
.
Alyosha
knew
he
would
not
.
He
would
not
follow
him
and
call
him
*NL*
back
,
he
knew
why
.
When
he
was
out
of
sight
,
Alyosha
picked
up
the
two
*NL*
notes
.
They
were
very
much
crushed
and
crumpled
,
and
had
been
pressed
into
*NL*
the
sand
,
but
were
uninjured
and
even
rustled
like
new
ones
when
Alyosha
*NL*
unfolded
them
and
smoothed
them
out
.
After
smoothing
them
out
,
he
folded
*NL*
them
up
,
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
went
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
to
report
on
*NL*
the
success
of
her
commission

The
Engagement
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
was
again
the
first
to
meet
Alyosha
.
She
was
flustered
;
*NL*
something
important
had
happened
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
hysterics
had
ended
*NL*
in
a
fainting
fit
,
and
then
``
a
terrible
,
awful
weakness
had
followed
,
she
*NL*
lay
with
her
eyes
turned
up
and
was
delirious
.
Now
she
was
in
a
fever
.
*NL*
They
had
sent
for
Herzenstube
;
they
had
sent
for
the
aunts
.
The
aunts
were
*NL*
already
here
,
but
Herzenstube
had
not
yet
come
.
They
were
all
sitting
in
*NL*
her
room
,
waiting
.
She
was
unconscious
now
,
and
what
if
it
turned
to
brain
*NL*
fever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
looked
gravely
alarmed
.
``
This
is
serious
,
serious
,
''
she
*NL*
added
at
every
word
,
as
though
nothing
that
had
happened
to
her
before
had
*NL*
been
serious
.
Alyosha
listened
with
distress
,
and
was
beginning
to
*NL*
describe
his
adventures
,
but
she
interrupted
him
at
the
first
words
.
She
*NL*
had
not
time
to
listen
.
She
begged
him
to
sit
with
Lise
and
wait
for
her
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lise
,
''
she
whispered
almost
in
his
ear
,
``
Lise
has
greatly
surprised
me
*NL*
just
now
,
dear
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
She
touched
me
,
too
,
and
so
my
heart
*NL*
forgives
her
everything
.
Only
fancy
,
as
soon
as
you
had
gone
,
she
began
to
*NL*
be
truly
remorseful
for
having
laughed
at
you
to-day
and
yesterday
,
though
*NL*
she
was
not
laughing
at
you
,
but
only
joking
.
But
she
was
seriously
sorry
*NL*
for
it
,
almost
ready
to
cry
,
so
that
I
was
quite
surprised
.
She
has
never
*NL*
been
really
sorry
for
laughing
at
me
,
but
has
only
made
a
joke
of
it
.
And
*NL*
you
know
she
is
laughing
at
me
every
minute
.
But
this
time
she
was
in
*NL*
earnest
.
She
thinks
a
great
deal
of
your
opinion
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
take
offense
or
be
wounded
by
her
if
you
can
help
it
.
I
am
never
*NL*
hard
upon
her
,
for
she
's
such
a
clever
little
thing
.
Would
you
believe
it
?
*NL*
She
said
just
now
that
you
were
a
friend
of
her
childhood
,
`
the
greatest
*NL*
friend
of
her
childhood
'
--
just
think
of
that
--
`
greatest
friend
'
--
and
what
*NL*
about
me
?
She
has
very
strong
feelings
and
memories
,
and
,
what
's
more
,
she
*NL*
uses
these
phrases
,
most
unexpected
words
,
which
come
out
all
of
a
sudden
*NL*
when
you
least
expect
them
.
She
spoke
lately
about
a
pine-tree
,
for
*NL*
instance
:
there
used
to
be
a
pine-tree
standing
in
our
garden
in
her
early
*NL*
childhood
.
Very
likely
it
's
standing
there
still
;
so
there
's
no
need
to
*NL*
speak
in
the
past
tense
.
Pine-trees
are
not
like
people
,
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
they
do
n't
change
quickly
.
`
Mamma
,
'
she
said
,
'
I
remember
*NL*
this
pine-tree
as
in
a
dream
,
'
only
she
said
something
so
original
about
*NL*
it
that
I
ca
n't
repeat
it
.
Besides
,
I
've
forgotten
it
.
Well
,
good-by
!
I
am
*NL*
so
worried
I
feel
I
shall
go
out
of
my
mind
.
Ah
!
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
I
've
*NL*
been
out
of
my
mind
twice
in
my
life
.
Go
to
Lise
,
cheer
her
up
,
as
you
*NL*
always
can
so
charmingly
.
Lise
,
''
she
cried
,
going
to
her
door
,
``
here
I
've
*NL*
brought
you
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
whom
you
insulted
so
.
He
is
not
at
all
*NL*
angry
,
I
assure
you
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
is
surprised
that
you
could

suppose
so

_
Merci

Come

Fyodorovitch

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
in
.
Lise
looked
rather
embarrassed
,
and
at
once
flushed
*NL*
crimson
.
She
was
evidently
ashamed
of
something
,
and
,
as
people
always
do
*NL*
in
such
cases
,
she
began
immediately
talking
of
other
things
,
as
though
*NL*
they
were
of
absorbing
interest
to
her
at
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
has
just
told
me
all
about
the
two
hundred
roubles

Alexey

Fyodorovitch
,
and
your
taking
them
to

poor
officer

told

all
the
awful
story

had
been
insulted

you
know

muddles

...
she
always
rushes
from
one
thing
to
*NL*
another
...
I
cried
when
I
heard
.
Well
,
did
you
give
him
the
money
and
how
*NL*
is
that
poor
man
getting
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
I
did
n't
give
it
to
him
,
and
it
's
a
long
story
,
''
answered
*NL*
Alyosha
,
as
though
he
,
too
,
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
regret
at
*NL*
having
failed
,
yet
Lise
saw
perfectly
well
that
he
,
too
,
looked
away
,
and
*NL*
that
he
,
too
,
was
trying
to
talk
of
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
sat
down
to
the
table
and
began
to
tell
his
story
,
but
at
the
*NL*
first
words
he
lost
his
embarrassment
and
gained
the
whole
of
Lise
's
*NL*
attention
as
well
.
He
spoke
with
deep
feeling
,
under
the
influence
of
the
*NL*
strong
impression
he
had
just
received
,
and
he
succeeded
in
telling
his
*NL*
story
well
and
circumstantially
.
In
old
days
in
Moscow
he
had
been
fond
of
*NL*
coming
to
Lise
and
describing
to
her
what
had
just
happened
to
him
,
what
*NL*
he
had
read
,
or
what
he
remembered
of
his
childhood
.
Sometimes
they
had
*NL*
made
day-dreams
and
woven
whole
romances
together
--
generally
cheerful
and
*NL*
amusing
ones
.
Now
they
both
felt
suddenly
transported
to
the
old
days
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
two
years
before
.
Lise
was
extremely
touched
by
his
story
.
Alyosha
*NL*
described
Ilusha
with
warm
feeling
.
When
he
finished
describing
how
the
*NL*
luckless
man
trampled
on
the
money
,
Lise
could
not
help
clasping
her
hands
*NL*
and
crying
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
n't
give
him
the
money
!
So
you
let
him
run
away
!
Oh
,
dear
,
you
*NL*
ought
to
have
run
after
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Lise
;
it
's
better
I
did
n't
run
after
him
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
getting
up
*NL*
from
his
chair
and
walking
thoughtfully
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
How
is
it
better
?
Now
they
are
without
food
and
their
case
is
*NL*
hopeless
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
hopeless
,
for
the
two
hundred
roubles
will
still
come
to
them
.
He
'll
*NL*
take
the
money
to-morrow
.
To-morrow
he
will
be
sure
to
take
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Alyosha
,
pacing
up
and
down
,
pondering
.
``
You
see
,
Lise
,
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
stopping
suddenly
before
her
,
``
I
made
one
blunder
,
but
that
,
even
that
,
is
*NL*
all
for
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
blunder
,
and
why
is
it
for
the
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
He
is
a
man
of
weak
and
timorous
character
;
he
has
*NL*
suffered
so
much
and
is
very
good-natured
.
I
keep
wondering
why
he
took
*NL*
offense
so
suddenly
,
for
I
assure
you
,
up
to
the
last
minute
,
he
did
not
*NL*
know
that
he
was
going
to
trample
on
the
notes
.
And
I
think
now
that
there
*NL*
was
a
great
deal
to
offend
him
...
and
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
in
*NL*
his
position
...
To
begin
with
,
he
was
sore
at
having
been
so
glad
of
the
*NL*
money
in
my
presence
and
not
having
concealed
it
from
me
.
If
he
had
been
*NL*
pleased
,
but
not
so
much
;
if
he
had
not
shown
it
;
if
he
had
begun
*NL*
affecting
scruples
and
difficulties
,
as
other
people
do
when
they
take
*NL*
money
,
he
might
still
endure
to
take
it
.
But
he
was
too
genuinely
*NL*
delighted
,
and
that
was
mortifying
.
Ah
,
Lise
,
he
is
a
good
and
truthful
*NL*
man
--
that
's
the
worst
of
the
whole
business
.
All
the
while
he
talked
,
his
*NL*
voice
was
so
weak
,
so
broken
,
he
talked
so
fast
,
so
fast
,
he
kept
laughing
*NL*
such
a
laugh
,
or
perhaps
he
was
crying
--
yes
,
I
am
sure
he
was
crying
,
he
*NL*
was
so
delighted
--
and
he
talked
about
his
daughters
--
and
about
the
situation
*NL*
he
could
get
in
another
town
...
And
when
he
had
poured
out
his
heart
,
he
*NL*
felt
ashamed
at
having
shown
me
his
inmost
soul
like
that
.
So
he
began
to
*NL*
hate
me
at
once
.
He
is
one
of
those
awfully
sensitive
poor
people
.
What
*NL*
had
made
him
feel
most
ashamed
was
that
he
had
given
in
too
soon
and
*NL*
accepted
me
as
a
friend
,
you
see
.
At
first
he
almost
flew
at
me
and
tried
*NL*
to
intimidate
me
,
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
money
he
had
begun
embracing
*NL*
me
;
he
kept
touching
me
with
his
hands
.
This
must
have
been
how
he
came
to
*NL*
feel
it
all
so
humiliating
,
and
then
I
made
that
blunder
,
a
very
important
*NL*
one
.
I
suddenly
said
to
him
that
if
he
had
not
money
enough
to
move
to
*NL*
another
town
,
we
would
give
it
to
him
,
and
,
indeed
,
I
myself
would
give
*NL*
him
as
much
as
he
wanted
out
of
my
own
money
.
That
struck
him
all
at
once
.
*NL*
Why
,
he
thought
,
did
I
put
myself
forward
to
help
him
?
You
know
,
Lise
,
*NL*
it
's
awfully
hard
for
a
man
who
has
been
injured
,
when
other
people
look
*NL*
at
him
as
though
they
were
his
benefactors
...
I
've
heard
that
;
Father
*NL*
Zossima
told
me
so
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
put
it
,
but
I
have
often
seen
it
*NL*
myself
.
And
I
feel
like
that
myself
,
too
.
And
the
worst
of
it
was
that
*NL*
though
he
did
not
know
,
up
to
the
very
last
minute
,
that
he
would
trample
*NL*
on
the
notes
,
he
had
a
kind
of
presentiment
of
it
,
I
am
sure
of
that
.
*NL*
That
's
just
what
made
him
so
ecstatic
,
that
he
had
that
presentiment
...
*NL*
And
though
it
's
so
dreadful
,
it
's
all
for
the
best
.
In
fact
,
I
believe
*NL*
nothing
better
could
have
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
why
could
nothing
better
have
happened
?
''
cried
Lise
,
looking
with
*NL*
great
surprise
at
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
if
he
had
taken
the
money
,
in
an
hour
after
getting
home
,
he
*NL*
would
be
crying
with
mortification
,
that
's
just
what
would
have
happened
.
*NL*
And
most
likely
he
would
have
come
to
me
early
to-morrow
,
and
perhaps
have
*NL*
flung
the
notes
at
me
and
trampled
upon
them
as
he
did
just
now
.
But
now
*NL*
he
has
gone
home
awfully
proud
and
triumphant
,
though
he
knows
he
has
*NL*
`
ruined
himself
.
'
So
now
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
make
him
accept
*NL*
the
two
hundred
roubles
by
to-morrow
,
for
he
has
already
vindicated
his
*NL*
honor
,
tossed
away
the
money
,
and
trampled
it
under
foot
...
He
could
n't
*NL*
know
when
he
did
it
that
I
should
bring
it
to
him
again
to-morrow
,
and
yet
*NL*
he
is
in
terrible
need
of
that
money
.
Though
he
is
proud
of
himself
now
,
*NL*
yet
even
to-day
he
'll
be
thinking
what
a
help
he
has
lost
.
He
will
think
*NL*
of
it
more
than
ever
at
night
,
will
dream
of
it
,
and
by
to-morrow
morning
*NL*
he
may
be
ready
to
run
to
me
to
ask
forgiveness
.
It
's
just
then
that
I
'll
*NL*
appear
.
`
Here
,
you
are
a
proud
man
,
'
I
shall
say
:
`
you
have
shown
it
;
but
*NL*
now
take
the
money
and
forgive
us
!
'
And
then
he
will
take
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
carried
away
with
joy
as
he
uttered
his
last
words
,
``
And
then
*NL*
he
will
take
it
!
''
Lise
clapped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
true
!
I
understand
that
perfectly
now
.
Ah
,
Alyosha
,
how
do
you
*NL*
know
all
this
?
So
young
and
yet
he
knows
what
's
in
the
heart
...
I
should
*NL*
never
have
worked
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
thing
now
is
to
persuade
him
that
he
is
on
an
equal
footing
*NL*
with
us
,
in
spite
of
his
taking
money
from
us
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
in
his
*NL*
excitement
,
``
and
not
only
on
an
equal
,
but
even
on
a
higher
footing

*NL*
*NL*
''

Alexey
Fyodorovitch
;

*NL*
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
there
is
n't
such
an
expression
as

;

n't
matter

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Do

be
angry

at
my
joking

she
put
in
at
once
,
with
strong
*NL*
feeling
.
``
I
am
absurd

small

poor

man

in
analyzing
his
soul
like

it
were

In

deciding
so
certainly
that
he
will
take
the
money

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Lise
,
it
's
not
contempt

''
Alyosha
answered
,
as
though
he
had
prepared
*NL*
himself
for
the
question
.
``
I
was
thinking
of
that
on
the
way
here

How
can
*NL*
it
be
contempt
when
we
are
all
like
him
,
when
we
are
all
just
the
same
as
*NL*
he
is
?
For
you
know
we
are
just
the
same
,
no
better

If
we
are
better
,
we
*NL*
should
have
been
just
the
same
in
his
place

I
do
n't
know
about
you

*NL*
Lise

but
I
consider
that
I
have
a
sordid
soul
in
many
ways

his
soul

is
not
sordid

on
the
contrary

full
of
fine
feeling

No

Lise

I
have
*NL*
no
contempt

Do
you
know

Lise

my
elder
told
me
once
to
care
for

most
people
exactly
as
one
would
for

for
some
of

Lise

in

nervous

hurried
whisper

Alyosha
went

opened
the

reported

Lise
went
on

flushing
redder

*NL*
redder
.
``
Give
me
your
hand

that
's
right

I
have
to
make
a
great

confession

write
to
you
yesterday
in
joke

in
earnest

and
*NL*
she
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hand

It
was
evident
that
she
was
greatly
*NL*
ashamed
of
the
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
snatched
his
hand
and
impulsively
kissed
it
three
times

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Lise

what
a

Alyosha
joyfully

*NL*
``
Sure

She
put
aside
his

did
not
leave
go
of
it

blushing
hotly

laughing
a
little
happy
laugh

But
her
reproach
was
undeserved

overcome

stood
still

down

cold

laughed

hid
her
face
in

she
*NL*
ejaculated
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
.
But
she
suddenly
ceased
laughing
and
*NL*
became
serious
,
almost
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha

put
off
kissing

We

time
to

she
ended
suddenly
.
``
Tell
me
rather
why
*NL*
you
who
are
so
clever

so
intellectual

so
observant

choose
a

Ah

I
am

happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

be
leaving

altogether
in
a
few
days

If
I
go
into
the
world
,
I
must
marry

I
know
that

_
He
_
told
me
to
marry

*NL*
too

Whom
could
I
marry
better
than
you
--
and
who
would
have
me
except
you

*NL*
I
have
been
thinking
it
over

In
the

you
've
known
me
from
a

child

you
've
a
great
many

You
are
more
light

*NL*
hearted
than
I
am

above
all
,
you
are
more
innocent
than
I
am

I
have
been
*NL*
brought
into
contact
with
many
,
many
things
already
...
Ah
,
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
but
I

too

am
a
Karamazov

What
does
it
matter
if
you
do
laugh
and
*NL*
make
jokes
,
and
at
me
,
too
?
Go
on
laughing
.
I
am
so
glad
you
do
.
You
laugh
*NL*
like
a
little
child

but
you
think
like
a
martyr

*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
a

How
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Lise

your
question
just
now

whether

contempt
*NL*
for
that
poor
man
by
dissecting
his
soul

that
was
the
question
of
a
*NL*
sufferer

You
see

I
do
n't
know
how
to
express
it
,
but
any
one
who
*NL*
thinks
of
such
questions
is
capable
of
suffering
.
Sitting
in
your
invalid

chair
you
must
have
thought
over
many
things
already

weak
with

Just
before

came
this

I
tried

out
calmly

gave
it
to
me

that
you

at
all

that
you
felt
nothing

were
simply
a
*NL*
stupid
boy
,
good
for
nothing
,
and
that
I
am
ruined

But
you
left
the
*NL*
letter
at
home
and
that
cheered
me
.
You
left
it
behind
on
purpose
,
so
as
*NL*
not
to
give
it
back
,
because
you
knew
I
would
ask

was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

it
was
not
so
a

The
letter
is
with

now

this
*NL*
morning
,
in
this
pocket

Here
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
pulled
the

out
laughing

showed

her
at

distance

*NL*

*NL*

tell

confused

pondering

``
I

Lise
suddenly

noticed
this
remark

some
surprise

*NL*

he
went
on

``
my

crude

What
is
the

said
Lise
quietly

gently

But
*NL*
Alyosha
did
not
answer

There
was
something
too
mysterious

too
subjective
*NL*
in
these
last
words
of
his
,
perhaps
obscure
to
himself

but
yet
torturing
*NL*
him

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
thought
it
better
not
to
go
in
to
Madame
Hohlakov
and
was
going
*NL*
out
of
the
house
without
saying
good-by
to
her
.
But
no
sooner
had
he
*NL*
opened
the
door
than
he
found
Madame
Hohlakov
standing
before
him
.
From
*NL*
the
first
word
Alyosha
guessed
that
she
had
been
waiting
on
purpose
to
*NL*
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Fyodorovitch

ridiculous

foolishness

nothing

foolishness

she
said

attacking
him
at
once

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
do

Alyosha

bad
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sensible
advice

sensible

I
to
understand

agreed

compassion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
was
quite
serious

Alyosha
declared

stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
serious
about
it

impossible

*NL*
``
But
why

asked
Alyosha

far
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Alexey
Fyodorovitch

that
's
true

of
course

you
'll
have
time
to
*NL*
quarrel
and
separate
a
thousand
times
in
a
year
and
a
half
.
But
I
am
so
*NL*
unhappy
!
Though
it
's
such
nonsense
,
it
's
a
great
blow
to
me

I
feel
like
*NL*
Famusov
in
the
last
scene
of
_
Sorrow
from
Wit
_

You
are
Tchatsky
and
she
*NL*
is
Sofya
,
and
,
only
fancy

I
've
run
down
to
meet
you
on
the
stairs
,
and
in
*NL*
the
play
the
fatal
scene
takes
place
on
the
staircase
.
I
heard
it
all
;
I
*NL*
almost
dropped
.
So
this
is
the
explanation
of
her
dreadful
night
and
her
*NL*
hysterics
of
late
!
It
means
love
to
the
daughter
but
death
to
the
mother
.
*NL*
I
might
as
well
be
in
my
grave
at
once

And
a
more
serious
matter
still

*NL*
what
is
this
letter
she
has
written
?
Show
it
me
at
once

at
once

Chapter
II
.
Smerdyakov
With
A
Guitar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
time
to
lose
indeed
.
Even
while
he
was
saying
good-by
to
Lise
,
*NL*
the
thought
had
struck
him
that
he
must
attempt
some
stratagem
to
find
his
*NL*
brother
Dmitri
,
who
was
evidently
keeping
out
of
his
way
.
It
was
getting
*NL*
late
,
nearly
three
o'clock
.
Alyosha
's
whole
soul
turned
to
the
monastery
,
*NL*
to
his
dying
saint
,
but
the
necessity
of
seeing
Dmitri
outweighed
*NL*
everything
.
The
conviction
that
a
great
inevitable
catastrophe
was
about
*NL*
to
happen
grew
stronger
in
Alyosha
's
mind
with
every
hour
.
What
that
*NL*
catastrophe
was
,
and
what
he
would
say
at
that
moment
to
his
brother
,
he
*NL*
could
perhaps
not
have
said
definitely
.
``
Even
if
my
benefactor
must
die
*NL*
without
me
,
anyway
I
wo
n't
have
to
reproach
myself
all
my
life
with
the
*NL*
thought
that
I
might
have
saved
something
and
did
not
,
but
passed
by
and
*NL*
hastened
home
.
If
I
do
as
I
intend
,
I
shall
be
following
his
great
*NL*
precept
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
plan
was
to
catch
his
brother
Dmitri
unawares
,
to
climb
over
the
*NL*
fence
,
as
he
had
the
day
before
,
get
into
the
garden
and
sit
in
the
*NL*
summer-house
.
If
Dmitri
were
not
there
,
thought
Alyosha
,
he
would
not
*NL*
announce
himself
to
Foma
or
the
women
of
the
house
,
but
would
remain
*NL*
hidden
in
the
summer-house
,
even
if
he
had
to
wait
there
till
evening
.
If
,
*NL*
as
before
,
Dmitri
were
lying
in
wait
for
Grushenka
to
come
,
he
would
be
*NL*
very
likely
to
come
to
the
summer-house
.
Alyosha
did
not
,
however
,
give
*NL*
much
thought
to
the
details
of
his
plan
,
but
resolved
to
act
upon
it
,
even
*NL*
if
it
meant
not
getting
back
to
the
monastery
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
happened
without
hindrance
,
he
climbed
over
the
hurdle
almost
*NL*
in
the
same
spot
as
the
day
before
,
and
stole
into
the
summer-house
*NL*
unseen
.
He
did
not
want
to
be
noticed
.
The
woman
of
the
house
and
Foma
*NL*
too
,
if
he
were
here
,
might
be
loyal
to
his
brother
and
obey
his
*NL*
instructions
,
and
so
refuse
to
let
Alyosha
come
into
the
garden
,
or
might
*NL*
warn
Dmitri
that
he
was
being
sought
and
inquired
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
summer-house
.
Alyosha
sat
down
and
began
to
wait
.
*NL*
He
looked
round
the
summer-house
,
which
somehow
struck
him
as
a
great
deal
*NL*
more
ancient
than
before
.
Though
the
day
was
just
as
fine
as
yesterday
,
it
*NL*
seemed
a
wretched
little
place
this
time
.
There
was
a
circle
on
the
table
,
*NL*
left
no
doubt
from
the
glass
of
brandy
having
been
spilt
the
day
before
.
*NL*
Foolish
and
irrelevant
ideas
strayed
about
his
mind
,
as
they
always
do
in
*NL*
a
time
of
tedious
waiting
.
He
wondered
,
for
instance
,
why
he
had
sat
down
*NL*
precisely
in
the
same
place
as
before
,
why
not
in
the
other
seat
.
At
last
*NL*
he
felt
very
depressed
--
depressed
by
suspense
and
uncertainty
.
But
he
had
*NL*
not
sat
there
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
he
suddenly
heard
the
*NL*
thrum
of
a
guitar
somewhere
quite
close
.
People
were
sitting
,
or
had
only
*NL*
just
sat
down
,
somewhere
in
the
bushes
not
more
than
twenty
paces
away
.
*NL*
Alyosha
suddenly
recollected
that
on
coming
out
of
the
summer-house
the
*NL*
day
before
,
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
old
green
low
garden-seat
among
*NL*
the
bushes
on
the
left
,
by
the
fence
.
The
people
must
be
sitting
on
it
*NL*
now
.
Who
were
they
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
's
voice
suddenly
began
singing
in
a
sugary
falsetto
,
accompanying
*NL*
himself
on
the
guitar
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
invincible
force
*NL*
I
am
bound
to
my
dear
.
*NL*
O
Lord
,
have
mercy
*NL*
On
her
and
on
me
!
*NL*
On
her
and
on
me
!
*NL*
On
her
and
on
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
ceased
.
It
was
a
lackey
's
tenor
and
a
lackey
's
song
.
Another
*NL*
voice
,
a
woman
's
,
suddenly
asked
insinuatingly
and
bashfully
,
though
with
*NL*
mincing
affectation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
n't
you
been
to
see
us
for
so
long
,
Pavel
Fyodorovitch
?
Why
do
*NL*
you
always
look
down
upon
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
answered
a
man
's
voice
politely
,
but
with
emphatic
dignity
.
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
the
man
had
the
best
of
the
position
,
and
that
the
woman
*NL*
was
making
advances
.
``
I
believe
the
man
must
be
Smerdyakov
,
''
thought
*NL*
Alyosha
,
``
from
his
voice
.
And
the
lady
must
be
the
daughter
of
the
house
*NL*
here
,
who
has
come
from
Moscow
,
the
one
who
wears
the
dress
with
a
tail
*NL*
and
goes
to
Marfa
for
soup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
awfully
fond
of
verses
of
all
kinds
,
if
they
rhyme
,
''
the
woman
's
*NL*
voice
continued
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
sang
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
do
I
care
for
royal
wealth
*NL*
If
but
my
dear
one
be
in
health
?
*NL*
Lord
have
mercy
*NL*
On
her
and
on
me
!
*NL*
On
her
and
on
me
!
*NL*
On
her
and
on
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
even
better
last
time
,
''
observed
the
woman
's
voice
.
``
You
sang
`
If
*NL*
my
darling
be
in
health
'
;
it
sounded
more
tender
.
I
suppose
you
've
*NL*
forgotten
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poetry
is
rubbish
!
''
said
Smerdyakov
curtly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
I
am
very
fond
of
poetry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
it
's
poetry
,
it
's
essential
rubbish
.
Consider
yourself
,
who
*NL*
ever
talks
in
rhyme
?
And
if
we
were
all
to
talk
in
rhyme
,
even
though
it
*NL*
were
decreed
by
government
,
we
should
n't
say
much
,
should
we
?
Poetry
is
no
*NL*
good

Marya
Kondratyevna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
clever
you
are
!
How
is
it
you
've
gone
so
deep
into
everything
?
''
The
*NL*
woman
's
voice
was
more
and
more
insinuating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
have
done
better
than
that

I
could
have
known
more
than
that
,
if
*NL*
it
had
not
been
for
my
destiny
from
my
childhood
up
.
I
would
have
shot
a
*NL*
man
in
a
duel
if
he
called
me
names
because
I
am
descended
from
a
filthy
*NL*
beggar
and
have
no
father
.
And
they
used
to
throw
it
in
my
teeth
in
*NL*
Moscow
.
It
had
reached
them
from
here
,
thanks
to
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
.
*NL*
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
blames
me
for
rebelling
against
my
birth
,
but
I
*NL*
would
have
sanctioned
their
killing
me
before
I
was
born
that
I
might
not
*NL*
have
come
into
the
world
at
all
.
They
used
to
say
in
the
market
,
and
your
*NL*
mamma
too
,
with
great
lack
of
delicacy
,
set
off
telling
me
that
her
hair
*NL*
was
like
a
mat
on
her
head
,
and
that
she
was
short
of
five
foot
by
a
wee
*NL*
bit
.
Why
talk
of
a
wee
bit
while
she
might
have
said
'
a
little
bit
,
'
like
*NL*
every
one
else
?
She
wanted
to
make
it
touching
,
a
regular
peasant
's
*NL*
feeling
.
Can
a
Russian
peasant
be
said
to
feel
,
in
comparison
with
an
*NL*
educated
man
?
He
ca
n't
be
said
to
have
feeling
at
all
,
in
his
ignorance
.
*NL*
From
my
childhood
up
when
I
hear
'
a
wee
bit
,
'
I
am
ready
to
burst
with
*NL*
rage

I
hate
all
Russia

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you

I

There

tenderly

doubtless
accompanying

grovels

mistaken
there

If
I
had
a
certain
sum
in
my
pocket
,
I
would
have
left
*NL*
here
long
ago

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
is
lower
than
any
lackey
in
his
*NL*
behavior

in
his
mind

in

poverty

He

I

with

I

Though
in

better

For

After
a
moment

the

tinkled

he
sang

again

falsetto

Then
something
unexpected
happened

Alyosha
suddenly
sneezed

They
were

silent

Alyosha
got
up
and
walked
towards
them

He
found
Smerdyakov
*NL*
dressed
up
and
wearing
polished
boots
,
his
hair
pomaded
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
curled
.
The
guitar
lay
on
the
garden-seat
.
His
companion
was
the
daughter

of
the
house
,
wearing
a
light-blue
dress
with
a
train
two
yards
long
.
She
*NL*
was
young
and
would
not
have
been
bad-looking
,
but
that
her
face
was
so
*NL*
round
and
terribly
freckled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
my
brother
Dmitri
soon
be
back
?
''
asked
Alyosha
with
as
much
*NL*
composure
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
got
up
slowly
;
Marya
Kondratyevna
rose
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
to
know
about
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
?
It
's
not
as
if
I
were
his
*NL*
keeper
,
''
answered
Smerdyakov
quietly
,
distinctly
,
and
superciliously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
simply
asked
whether
you
do
know
?
''
Alyosha
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
and
do
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
brother
told
me
that
you
let
him
know
all
that
goes
on
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
promised
to
let
him
know
when
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
turned
a
deliberate
,
unmoved
glance
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
you
get
in
this
time
,
since
the
gate
was
bolted
an
hour
ago
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
,
looking
at
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
in
from
the
back-alley
,
over
the
fence
,
and
went
straight
to
the
*NL*
summer-house
.
I
hope
you
'll
forgive
me
,
''
he
added
,
addressing
Marya
*NL*
Kondratyevna
.
``
I
was
in
a
hurry
to
find
my
brother
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
as
though
we
could
take
it
amiss
in
you
!

drawled
Marya
*NL*
Kondratyevna
,
flattered
by
Alyosha
's
apology
.
``
For
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
*NL*
often
goes
to
the
summer-house
in
that
way
.
We
do
n't
know
he
is
here
and
*NL*
he
is
sitting
in
the
summer-house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
anxious
to
find
him
,
or
to
learn
from
you
where
he
is
now

*NL*
Believe
me
,
it
's
on
business
of
great
importance
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
tells
us
,
''
lisped
Marya
Kondratyevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
I
used
to
come
here
as
a
friend
,
''
Smerdyakov
began
again
,
``
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
has
pestered
me
in
a
merciless
way
even
here
by
his
incessant
*NL*
questions
about
the
master
.
`
What
news
?
'
he
'll
ask
.
`
What
's
going
on
in
*NL*
there
now
?
Who
's
coming
and
going
?
'
and
ca
n't
I
tell
him
something
more
.
*NL*
Twice
already
he
's
threatened
me
with
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
death
?
''
Alyosha
exclaimed
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
he
'd
think
much
of
that
,
with
his
temper
,
which
you
had
a
*NL*
chance
of
observing
yourself
yesterday
?
He
says
if
I
let
Agrafena
*NL*
Alexandrovna
in
and
she
passes
the
night
there
,
I
'll
be
the
first
to
*NL*
suffer
for
it

I
am
terribly
afraid
of
him
,
and
if
I
were
not
even
more
*NL*
afraid
of
doing
so
,
I
ought
to
let
the
police
know
.
God
only
knows
what
he
*NL*
might
not
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
honor
said
to
him
the
other
day
,
`
I
'll
pound
you
in
a
mortar
!

''
*NL*
added
Marya
Kondratyevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
it
's
pounding
in
a
mortar
,
it
may
be
only
talk
,
''
observed
Alyosha
.
*NL*
``
If
I
could
meet
him
,
I
might
speak
to
him
about
that
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
only
thing
I
can
tell
you
is
this
,
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
as
though
*NL*
thinking
better
of
it
;
``
I
am
here
as
an
old
friend
and
neighbor
,
and
it
*NL*
would
be
odd
if
I
did
n't
come
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
sent
*NL*
me
first
thing
this
morning
to
your
brother
's
lodging
in
Lake
Street
,
*NL*
without
a
letter
,
but
with
a
message
to
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
to
go
to
dine
*NL*
with
him
at
the
restaurant
here
,
in
the
market-place
.
I
went
,
but
did
n't
*NL*
find
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
at
home
,
though
it
was
eight
o'clock
.
`
He
's
been
*NL*
here
,
but
he
is
quite
gone
,
'
those
were
the
very
words
of
his
landlady
.
*NL*
It
's
as
though
there
was
an
understanding
between
them
.
Perhaps
at
this
*NL*
moment
he
is
in
the
restaurant
with
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
for
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
has
not
been
home
to
dinner
and
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
dined
alone
*NL*
an
hour
ago
,
and
is
gone
to
lie
down
.
But
I
beg
you
most
particularly
not
*NL*
to
speak
of
me
and
of
what
I
have
told
you
,
for
he
'd
kill
me
for
nothing
*NL*
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
Ivan
invited
Dmitri
to
the
restaurant
to-day

repeated
Alyosha
*NL*
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Metropolis

market-place

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
quite
likely

cried
Alyosha
,
much
excited
.
``
Thank
you
,
*NL*
Smerdyakov
;
that
's
important
.
I
'll
go
there
at
once
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
betray
me

Smerdyakov
called
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

I
'll
go
to
the

as

by
chance

Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wait
a
minute

I
'll
open

you

Marya
Kondratyevna

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
's
a
short
cut

I
'll
get
over
the
fence
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
had
heard
threw
Alyosha
into
great
agitation
.
He
ran
to
the
*NL*
tavern
.
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
into
the
tavern
in
his
monastic
*NL*
dress
,
but
he
could
inquire
at
the
entrance
for
his
brothers
and
call
them
*NL*
down
.
But
just
as
he
reached
the
tavern
,
a
window
was
flung
open
,
and
his
*NL*
brother
Ivan
called
down
to
him
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
ca
n't
you
come
up
here
to
me
?
I
shall
be
awfully
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
I
can
,
only
I
do
n't
quite
know
whether

this
dress

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
in
a
room
apart
.
Come
up
the
steps
;
I
'll
run
down
to
meet
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
Alyosha
was
sitting
beside
his
brother
.
Ivan
was
alone
*NL*
dining
.

*NL*
Chapter

The
Brothers
Make
Friends
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
was
not
,
however
,
in
a
separate
room
,
but
only
in
a
place
shut
off
by
*NL*
a
screen
,
so
that
it
was
unseen
by
other
people
in
the
room
.
It
was
the
*NL*
first
room
from
the
entrance
with
a
buffet
along
the
wall
.
Waiters
were
*NL*
continually
darting
to
and
fro
in
it
.
The
only
customer
in
the
room
was
an
*NL*
old
retired
military
man
drinking
tea
in
a
corner
.
But
there
was
the
usual
*NL*
bustle
going
on
in
the
other
rooms
of
the
tavern
;
there
were
shouts
for
*NL*
the
waiters
,
the
sound
of
popping
corks
,
the
click
of
billiard
balls
,
the
*NL*
drone
of
the
organ
.
Alyosha
knew
that
Ivan
did
not
usually
visit
this
*NL*
tavern
and
disliked
taverns
in
general
.
So
he
must
have
come
here
,
he
*NL*
reflected
,
simply
to
meet
Dmitri
by
arrangement
.
Yet
Dmitri
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
order
you
fish
,
soup
or
anything
.
You
do
n't
live
on
tea
alone
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
''
cried
Ivan
,
apparently
delighted
at
having
got
hold
of
Alyosha
.
*NL*
He
had
finished
dinner
and
was
drinking
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
have
soup
,
and
tea
afterwards
,
I
am
hungry
,
''
said
Alyosha
gayly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
cherry
jam
?
They
have
it
here
.
You
remember
how
you
used
to
love
*NL*
cherry
jam
when
you
were
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
that
?
Let
me
have
jam
too
,
I
like
it
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
rang
for
the
waiter
and
ordered
soup
,
jam
and
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
everything
,
Alyosha
,
I
remember
you
till
you
were
eleven
,
I
*NL*
was
nearly
fifteen
.
There
's
such
a
difference
between
fifteen
and
eleven
*NL*
that
brothers
are
never
companions
at
those
ages
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
*NL*
was
fond
of
you
even
.
When
I
went
away
to
Moscow
for
the
first
few
years
I
*NL*
never
thought
of
you
at
all
.
Then
,
when
you
came
to
Moscow
yourself
,
we
*NL*
only
met
once
somewhere
,
I
believe
.
And
now
I
've
been
here
more
than
three
*NL*
months
,
and
so
far
we
have
scarcely
said
a
word
to
each
other
.
To-morrow
I
*NL*
am
going
away
,
and
I
was
just
thinking
as
I
sat
here
how
I
could
see
you
*NL*
to
say
good-by
and
just
then
you
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
very
anxious
to
see
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
.
I
want
to
get
to
know
you
once
for
all
,
and
I
want
you
to
know
me
.
*NL*
And
then
to
say
good-by
.
I
believe
it
's
always
best
to
get
to
know
people
*NL*
just
before
leaving
them
.
I
've
noticed
how
you
've
been
looking
at
me
these
*NL*
three
months
.
There
has
been
a
continual
look
of
expectation
in
your
eyes
,
*NL*
and
I
ca
n't
endure
that
.
That
's
how
it
is
I
've
kept
away
from
you
.
But
in
*NL*
the
end
I
have
learned
to
respect
you
.
The
little
man
stands
firm
,
I
*NL*
thought
.
Though
I
am
laughing
,
I
am
serious
.
You
do
stand
firm
,
do
n't
you
?
*NL*
I
like
people
who
are
firm
like
that
whatever
it
is
they
stand
by
,
even
if
*NL*
they
are
such
little
fellows
as
you
.
Your
expectant
eyes
ceased
to
annoy
*NL*
me
,
I
grew
fond
of
them
in
the
end
,
those
expectant
eyes
.
You
seem
to
love
*NL*
me
for
some
reason
,
Alyosha
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
love
you
,
Ivan
.
Dmitri
says
of
you
--
Ivan
is
a
tomb
!
I
say
of
you
,
*NL*
Ivan
is
a
riddle
.
You
are
a
riddle
to
me
even
now
.
But
I
understand
*NL*
something
in
you
,
and
I
did
not
understand
it
till
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
laughed
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
angry
?
''
Alyosha
laughed
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
are
just
as
young
as
other
young
men
of
three
and
twenty
,
that
*NL*
you
are
just
a
young
and
fresh
and
nice
boy
,
green
in
fact
!
Now
,
have
I
*NL*
insulted
you
dreadfully
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
struck
by
a
coincidence
,
''
cried
Ivan
,
warmly
and
*NL*
good-humoredly
.
``
Would
you
believe
it
that
ever
since
that
scene
with
her
,
*NL*
I
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
my
youthful
greenness
,
and
just
as
*NL*
though
you
guessed
that
,
you
begin
about
it
.
Do
you
know
I
've
been
sitting
*NL*
here
thinking
to
myself
:
that
if
I
did
n't
believe
in
life
,
if
I
lost
faith
*NL*
in
the
woman
I
love
,
lost
faith
in
the
order
of
things
,
were
convinced
in
*NL*
fact
that
everything
is
a
disorderly
,
damnable
,
and
perhaps
devil-ridden
*NL*
chaos
,
if
I
were
struck
by
every
horror
of
man
's
disillusionment
--
still
I
*NL*
should
want
to
live
and
,
having
once
tasted
of
the
cup
,
I
would
not
turn
*NL*
away
from
it
till
I
had
drained
it
!
At
thirty
,
though
,
I
shall
be
sure
to
*NL*
leave
the
cup
,
even
if
I
've
not
emptied
it
,
and
turn
away
--
where
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
But
till
I
am
thirty
,
I
know
that
my
youth
will
triumph
over
*NL*
everything
--
every
disillusionment
,
every
disgust
with
life
.
I
've
asked
*NL*
myself
many
times
whether
there
is
in
the
world
any
despair
that
would
*NL*
overcome
this
frantic
and
perhaps
unseemly
thirst
for
life
in
me
,
and
I
've
*NL*
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
n't
,
that
is
till
I
am
thirty
,
and
*NL*
then
I
shall
lose
it
of
myself
,
I
fancy
.
Some
driveling
consumptive
*NL*
moralists
--
and
poets
especially
--
often
call
that
thirst
for
life
base
.
It
's
*NL*
a
feature
of
the
Karamazovs
,
it
's
true
,
that
thirst
for
life
regardless
of
*NL*
everything
;
you
have
it
no
doubt
too
,
but
why
is
it
base
?
The
centripetal
*NL*
force
on
our
planet
is
still
fearfully
strong
,
Alyosha
.
I
have
a
longing
*NL*
for
life
,
and
I
go
on
living
in
spite
of
logic
.
Though
I
may
not
believe
*NL*
in
the
order
of
the
universe
,
yet
I
love
the
sticky
little
leaves
as
they
*NL*
open
in
spring
.
I
love
the
blue
sky
,
I
love
some
people
,
whom
one
loves
*NL*
you
know
sometimes
without
knowing
why
.
I
love
some
great
deeds
done
by
*NL*
men
,
though
I
've
long
ceased
perhaps
to
have
faith
in
them
,
yet
from
old
*NL*
habit
one
's
heart
prizes
them
.
Here
they
have
brought
the
soup
for
you
,
*NL*
eat
it
,
it
will
do
you
good
.
It
's
first-rate
soup
,
they
know
how
to
make
*NL*
it
here
.
I
want
to
travel
in
Europe
,
Alyosha
,
I
shall
set
off
from
here
.
*NL*
And
yet
I
know
that
I
am
only
going
to
a
graveyard
,
but
it
's
a
most
*NL*
precious
graveyard
,
that
's
what
it
is
!
Precious
are
the
dead
that
lie
*NL*
there
,
every
stone
over
them
speaks
of
such
burning
life
in
the
past
,
of
*NL*
such
passionate
faith
in
their
work
,
their
truth
,
their
struggle
and
their
*NL*
science
,
that
I
know
I
shall
fall
on
the
ground
and
kiss
those
stones
and
*NL*
weep
over
them
;
though
I
'm
convinced
in
my
heart
that
it
's
long
been
*NL*
nothing
but
a
graveyard
.
And
I
shall
not
weep
from
despair
,
but
simply
*NL*
because
I
shall
be
happy
in
my
tears
,
I
shall
steep
my
soul
in
my
emotion
.
*NL*
I
love
the
sticky
leaves
in
spring
,
the
blue
sky
--
that
's
all
it
is
.
It
's
*NL*
not
a
matter
of
intellect
or
logic
,
it
's
loving
with
one
's
inside
,
with
*NL*
one
's
stomach
.
One
loves
the
first
strength
of
one
's
youth
.
Do
you
*NL*
understand
anything
of
my
tirade
,
Alyosha
?
''
Ivan
laughed
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
too
well
,
Ivan
.
One
longs
to
love
with
one
's
inside
,
with
*NL*
one
's
stomach
.
You
said
that
so
well
and
I
am
awfully
glad
that
you
have
*NL*
such
a
longing
for
life
,
''
cried
Alyosha
.
``
I
think
every
one
should
love
*NL*
life
above
everything
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
life
more
than
the
meaning
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
love
it

regardless
of
logic
as
you
say

it
must
be

of

and
it
's
only
then
one
will
understand
the
meaning
of
it

I
have
*NL*
thought
so
a
long
time
.
Half
your
work
is
done
,
Ivan

you
love
life

only

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

perhaps
I

what
does
your

half
mean
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

has
to
raise
up
your

Come
,
let
me
have
tea
.
I
am
so
glad
of
our

Ivan

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
feeling
inspired

I
am

You
are
a

Alexey

Is
it

that
you

leave

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

me
out

*NL*
*NL*

We

We

thirty

shall
begin
to
turn

Father
does
n't
want
*NL*
to
turn
aside
from
his
cup
till
he
is
seventy

he
dreams
of
hanging
on

eighty

so
he
says

He

it
only

he
is
a
*NL*
buffoon

He
stands
on
a
firm
rock

he
stands
on
his
sensuality

though
*NL*
after
we
are
thirty

indeed
,
there
may
be
nothing
else
to
stand
on

But
*NL*
to
hang
on
to
seventy
is
nasty
,
better
only
to
thirty

one
might
retain

a

shadow
of
nobility

by
deceiving
oneself

Have
you
seen
Dmitri
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
saw
Smerdyakov
,
''
and
Alyosha
rapidly
,
though
minutely
,
*NL*
described
his
meeting
with
Smerdyakov
.
Ivan
began
listening
anxiously
and
*NL*
questioned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
begged
me
not
to
tell
Dmitri

Ivan
frowned

pondered

*NL*

Alyosha

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Ivan
reluctantly

*NL*

Alyosha
anxiously

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

always
harping
upon

What

Am

my

Dmitri

keeper

''
Ivan
snapped
irritably
,
but
then
he
suddenly
*NL*
smiled
bitterly
.
``
Cain

steal
his
beautiful
Katerina

for
the

*NL*
Nonsense

I
had

it

now

*NL*

Yes

And
after

what

I

do
with
Dmitri
?
Dmitri
does
n't
come
in

I
had
my
own
business
to
settle
*NL*
with
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
You
know
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
Dmitri
behaved
as
*NL*
though
there
was
an
understanding
between
us

I
did
n't
ask
him
to
do
it
,
*NL*
but
he
solemnly
handed
her
over
to
me

gave
us
his

It
's
all
*NL*
too
funny

Ah

Alyosha

light
my

Would

I
sat
here
eating
my
dinner

was
nearly
ordering

champagne
to
celebrate
my
first
hour
of
freedom

Tfoo

It
's
been
going
on
*NL*
nearly
six
months
,
and
all
at
once
I
've
thrown
it
off
.
I
could
never
have
*NL*
guessed
even
yesterday
,
how
easy
it
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
it
if
I
*NL*
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Ivan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

I
fell
in

with

I
worried

myself
over
her
and
she
worried
me

I
sat
watching
over
her
...
and
all
at
*NL*
once
it
's
collapsed
!
I
spoke
this
morning
with
inspiration

I
went
*NL*
away
and
roared
with
laughter

Would

Yes

*NL*
``
You

suddenly
grown
brighter

*NL*

do

No

laughed
Ivan

``

n't

reflections

you
rushed

discussion
this
morning

I
've
forgotten
*NL*
to
kiss
you
for
it

But
how
she
tormented
me

It
certainly
was
sitting
*NL*
by
a

laceration

Ah

she
knew
how
I
loved
her

She
loved
me

not
*NL*
Dmitri

''
Ivan
insisted
gayly
.
``
Her
feeling
for
Dmitri
was
simply
a
self

*NL*
laceration

All
I
told
her
just
now
was
perfectly
true
,
but
the
worst
of
*NL*
it
is
,
it
may
take
her
fifteen
or
twenty
years
to
find
out
that
she
*NL*
does
n't
care
for
Dmitri

loves
me

she
torments

perhaps
she
*NL*
may
never
find
it
out
at
all

in

of
her
lesson
to-day

Well
,
it
's
*NL*
better
so

I
can
simply
go
away
for
good

By
the
way

how
is
she
now

What
*NL*
happened
after
I
departed

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
told
him
she
had
been
hysterical

that
she
was
now

he
heard

*NL*
unconscious

delirious

up

In

here

they

down

talk

the
transformation

on

so
that
it

And
masses

only
fancy
,
perhaps
I
too
accept
God

''
*NL*
laughed
Ivan
;
``
that
's
a
surprise
for
you
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

of

if
you
are
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joking
?
I
was
told
at
the
elder
's
yesterday
that
I
was
joking
.
You
know
,
*NL*
dear
boy
,
there
was
an
old
sinner
in
the
eighteenth
century
who
declared
*NL*
that
,
if
there
were
no
God
,
he
would
have
to
be
invented
.
_
S'il
n'existait
*NL*
pas
Dieu
,
il
faudrait
l'inventer
.
_
And
man
has
actually
invented
God
.
And
*NL*
what
's
strange
,
what
would
be
marvelous
,
is
not
that
God
should
really
*NL*
exist
;
the
marvel
is
that
such
an
idea
,
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
God
,
*NL*
could
enter
the
head
of
such
a
savage
,
vicious
beast
as
man
.
So
holy
it
*NL*
is
,
so
touching
,
so
wise
and
so
great
a
credit
it
does
to
man
.
As
for
me
,
*NL*
I
've
long
resolved
not
to
think
whether
man
created
God
or
God
man
.
And
I
*NL*
wo
n't
go
through
all
the
axioms
laid
down
by
Russian
boys
on
that
subject
,
*NL*
all
derived
from
European
hypotheses
;
for
what
's
a
hypothesis
there
,
is
an
*NL*
axiom
with
the
Russian
boy
,
and
not
only
with
the
boys
but
with
their
*NL*
teachers
too
,
for
our
Russian
professors
are
often
just
the
same
boys
*NL*
themselves
.
And
so
I
omit
all
the
hypotheses
.
For
what
are
we
aiming
at
*NL*
now
?
I
am
trying
to
explain
as
quickly
as
possible
my
essential
nature
,
*NL*
that
is
what
manner
of
man
I
am
,
what
I
believe
in
,
and
for
what
I
hope
,
*NL*
that
's
it
,
is
n't
it
?
And
therefore
I
tell
you
that
I
accept
God
simply
.
*NL*
But
you
must
note
this
:
if
God
exists
and
if
He
really
did
create
the
*NL*
world
,
then
,
as
we
all
know
,
He
created
it
according
to
the
geometry
of
*NL*
Euclid
and
the
human
mind
with
the
conception
of
only
three
dimensions
in
*NL*
space
.
Yet
there
have
been
and
still
are
geometricians
and
philosophers
,
*NL*
and
even
some
of
the
most
distinguished
,
who
doubt
whether
the
whole
*NL*
universe
,
or
to
speak
more
widely
the
whole
of
being
,
was
only
created
in
*NL*
Euclid
's
geometry
;
they
even
dare
to
dream
that
two
parallel
lines
,
which
*NL*
according
to
Euclid
can
never
meet
on
earth
,
may
meet
somewhere
in
*NL*
infinity
.
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
,
since
I
ca
n't
understand
*NL*
even
that
,
I
ca
n't
expect
to
understand
about
God
.
I
acknowledge
humbly
*NL*
that
I
have
no
faculty
for
settling
such
questions
,
I
have
a
Euclidian
*NL*
earthly
mind
,
and
how
could
I
solve
problems
that
are
not
of
this
world
?
*NL*
And
I
advise
you
never
to
think
about
it
either
,
my
dear
Alyosha
,
*NL*
especially
about
God
,
whether
He
exists
or
not
.
All
such
questions
are
*NL*
utterly
inappropriate
for
a
mind
created
with
an
idea
of
only
three
*NL*
dimensions
.
And
so
I
accept
God
and
am
glad
to
,
and
what
's
more
,
I
accept
*NL*
His
wisdom
,
His
purpose
--
which
are
utterly
beyond
our
ken
;
I
believe
in
the
*NL*
underlying
order
and
the
meaning
of
life
;
I
believe
in
the
eternal
harmony
*NL*
in
which
they
say
we
shall
one
day
be
blended
.
I
believe
in
the
Word
to
*NL*
Which
the
universe
is
striving
,
and
Which
Itself
was
`
with
God
,
'
and
Which
*NL*
Itself
is
God
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
,
to
infinity
.
There
are
all
sorts
of
*NL*
phrases
for
it
.
I
seem
to
be
on
the
right
path
,
do
n't
I
?
Yet
would
you
*NL*
believe
it
,
in
the
final
result
I
do
n't
accept
this
world
of
God
's
,
and
,
*NL*
although
I
know
it
exists
,
I
do
n't
accept
it
at
all
.
It
's
not
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
accept
God
,
you
must
understand
,
it
's
the
world
created
by
Him
I
do
n't
and
*NL*
can
not
accept
.
Let
me
make
it
plain
.
I
believe
like
a
child
that
suffering
*NL*
will
be
healed
and
made
up
for
,
that
all
the
humiliating
absurdity
of
*NL*
human
contradictions
will
vanish
like
a
pitiful
mirage
,
like
the
*NL*
despicable
fabrication
of
the
impotent
and
infinitely
small
Euclidian
mind
*NL*
of
man
,
that
in
the
world
's
finale
,
at
the
moment
of
eternal
harmony
,
*NL*
something
so
precious
will
come
to
pass
that
it
will
suffice
for
all
*NL*
hearts
,
for
the
comforting
of
all
resentments
,
for
the
atonement
of
all
*NL*
the
crimes
of
humanity
,
of
all
the
blood
they
've
shed
;
that
it
will
make
*NL*
it
not
only
possible
to
forgive
but
to
justify
all
that
has
happened
with
*NL*
men
--
but
though
all
that
may
come
to
pass
,
I
do
n't
accept
it
.
I
wo
n't
*NL*
accept
it
.
Even
if
parallel
lines
do
meet
and
I
see
it
myself
,
I
shall
see
*NL*
it
and
say
that
they
've
met
,
but
still
I
wo
n't
accept
it
.
That
's
what
's
at
*NL*
the
root
of
me
,
Alyosha
;
that
's
my
creed
.
I
am
in
earnest
in
what
I
say
.
I
*NL*
began
our
talk
as
stupidly
as
I
could
on
purpose
,
but
I
've
led
up
to
my
*NL*
confession
,
for
that
's
all
you
want
.
You
did
n't
want
to
hear
about
God
,
*NL*
but
only
to
know
what
the
brother
you
love
lives
by
.
And
so
I
've
told
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
concluded
his
long
tirade
with
marked
and
unexpected
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
you
begin
`
as
stupidly
as
you
could
'
?
''
asked
Alyosha
,
looking
*NL*
dreamily
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

inconceivably
stupidly

And
secondly
,
*NL*
the

the

and
artless

wriggles
and
hides
itself
.
Intelligence
is
a
knave
,
but
stupidity
is
*NL*
honest
and
straightforward

I
've
led
the
conversation
to
my
despair

the
more
stupidly

``
You

Ivan
smiled
suddenly

quite
like

*NL*
``
I
must
make
you
one
confession
,
''
Ivan
began
.
``
I
could
never
understand
*NL*
how
one
can
love
one
's
neighbors
.
It
's
just
one
's
neighbors
,
to
my
mind
,
*NL*
that
one
ca
n't
love
,
though
one
might
love
those
at
a
distance
.
I
once
*NL*
read
somewhere
of
John
the
Merciful
,
a
saint
,
that
when
a
hungry
,
frozen
*NL*
beggar
came
to
him
,
he
took
him
into
his
bed
,
held
him
in
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
began
breathing
into
his
mouth
,
which
was
putrid
and
loathsome
from
some
*NL*
awful
disease
.
I
am
convinced
that
he
did
that
from
`
self-laceration
,
'
*NL*
from
the
self-laceration
of
falsity
,
for
the
sake
of
the
charity
imposed
*NL*
by
duty
,
as
a
penance
laid
on
him
.
For
any
one
to
love
a
man
,
he
must
be
*NL*
hidden
,
for
as
soon
as
he
shows
his
face
,
love
is
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Zossima
has
talked
of
that
more
than
once
,
''
observed
Alyosha
;
``
he
,
*NL*
too
,
said
that
the
face
of
a
man
often
hinders
many
people
not
practiced
*NL*
in
love
,
from
loving
him
.
But
yet
there
's
a
great
deal
of
love
in
mankind
,
*NL*
and
almost
Christ-like
love
.
I
know
that
myself
,
Ivan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
know
nothing
of
it
so
far
,
and
ca
n't
understand
it
,
and
the
*NL*
innumerable
mass
of
mankind
are
with
me
there
.
The
question
is
,
whether
*NL*
that
's
due
to
men
's
bad
qualities
or
whether
it
's
inherent
in
their
*NL*
nature
.
To
my
thinking
,
Christ-like
love
for
men
is
a
miracle
impossible
*NL*
on
earth
.
He
was
God
.
But
we
are
not
gods
.
Suppose
I
,
for
instance
,
suffer
*NL*
intensely
.
Another
can
never
know
how
much
I
suffer
,
because
he
is
another
*NL*
and
not
I.
And
what
's
more
,
a
man
is
rarely
ready
to
admit
another
's
*NL*
suffering
-LRB-
as
though
it
were
a
distinction
-RRB-
.
Why
wo
n't
he
admit
it
,
do
you
*NL*
think
?
Because
I
smell
unpleasant
,
because
I
have
a
stupid
face
,
because
I
*NL*
once
trod
on
his
foot
.
Besides
,
there
is
suffering
and
suffering
;
*NL*
degrading
,
humiliating
suffering
such
as
humbles
me
--
hunger
,
for
*NL*
instance
--
my
benefactor
will
perhaps
allow
me
;
but
when
you
come
to
higher
*NL*
suffering
--
for
an
idea
,
for
instance
--
he
will
very
rarely
admit
that
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
my
face
strikes
him
as
not
at
all
what
he
fancies
a
man
*NL*
should
have
who
suffers
for
an
idea
.
And
so
he
deprives
me
instantly
of
*NL*
his
favor
,
and
not
at
all
from
badness
of
heart
.
Beggars
,
especially
*NL*
genteel
beggars
,
ought
never
to
show
themselves
,
but
to
ask
for
charity
*NL*
through
the
newspapers
.
One
can
love
one
's
neighbors
in
the
abstract
,
or
*NL*
even
at
a
distance
,
but
at
close
quarters
it
's
almost
impossible
.
If
it
*NL*
were
as
on
the
stage
,
in
the
ballet
,
where
if
beggars
come
in
,
they
wear
*NL*
silken
rags
and
tattered
lace
and
beg
for
alms
dancing
gracefully
,
then
*NL*
one
might
like
looking
at
them
.
But
even
then
we
should
not
love
them
.
But
*NL*
enough
of
that
.
I
simply
wanted
to
show
you
my
point
of
view
.
I
meant
to
*NL*
speak
of
the
suffering
of
mankind
generally
,
but
we
had
better
confine
*NL*
ourselves
to
the
sufferings
of
the
children
.
That
reduces
the
scope
of
my
*NL*
argument
to
a
tenth
of
what
it
would
be
.
Still
we
'd
better
keep
to
the
*NL*
children
,
though
it
does
weaken
my
case
.
But
,
in
the
first
place
,
children
*NL*
can
be
loved
even
at
close
quarters
,
even
when
they
are
dirty
,
even
when
*NL*
they
are
ugly
-LRB-
I
fancy
,
though
,
children
never
are
ugly
-RRB-
.
The
second
*NL*
reason
why
I
wo
n't
speak
of
grown-up
people
is
that
,
besides
being
*NL*
disgusting
and
unworthy
of
love
,
they
have
a
compensation
--
they
've
eaten
*NL*
the
apple
and
know
good
and
evil
,
and
they
have
become
`
like
gods
.
'
They
*NL*
go
on
eating
it
still
.
But
the
children
have
n't
eaten
anything
,
and
are
so
*NL*
far
innocent
.
Are
you
fond
of
children
,
Alyosha
?
I
know
you
are
,
and
you
*NL*
will
understand
why
I
prefer
to
speak
of
them
.
If
they
,
too
,
suffer
*NL*
horribly
on
earth
,
they
must
suffer
for
their
fathers
'
sins
,
they
must
be
*NL*
punished
for
their
fathers
,
who
have
eaten
the
apple
;
but
that
reasoning
*NL*
is
of
the
other
world
and
is
incomprehensible
for
the
heart
of
man
here
on
*NL*
earth
.
The
innocent
must
not
suffer
for
another
's
sins
,
and
especially
*NL*
such
innocents
!
You
may
be
surprised
at
me
,
Alyosha
,
but
I
am
awfully
fond
*NL*
of
children
,
too
.
And
observe
,
cruel
people
,
the
violent
,
the
rapacious
,
*NL*
the
Karamazovs
are
sometimes
very
fond
of
children
.
Children
while
they
*NL*
are
quite
little
--
up
to
seven
,
for
instance
--
are
so
remote
from
grown-up
*NL*
people
;
they
are
different
creatures
,
as
it
were
,
of
a
different
species
.
*NL*
I
knew
a
criminal
in
prison
who
had
,
in
the
course
of
his
career
as
a
*NL*
burglar
,
murdered
whole
families
,
including
several
children
.
But
when
he
*NL*
was
in
prison
,
he
had
a
strange
affection
for
them
.
He
spent
all
his
time
*NL*
at
his
window
,
watching
the
children
playing
in
the
prison
yard
.
He
*NL*
trained
one
little
boy
to
come
up
to
his
window
and
made
great
friends
*NL*
with
him
...
You
do
n't
know
why
I
am
telling
you
all
this
,
Alyosha

My
*NL*
head
aches
and
I
am
sad

*NL*
*NL*
``

observed
Alyosha
uneasily
,
``

though

were
not
quite

``

Ivan

they

People
talk
sometimes

great

.
The
tiger
only
tears
and
gnaws
,
that
's
all
*NL*
he
can
do
.
He
would
never
think
of
nailing
people
by
the
ears
,
even
if
he
*NL*
were
able
to
do
it
.
These
Turks
took
a
pleasure
in
torturing
children
,
*NL*
too
;
cutting
the
unborn
child
from
the
mother
's
womb
,
and
tossing
babies
*NL*
up
in
the
air
and
catching
them
on
the
points
of
their
bayonets
before
*NL*
their
mothers
'
eyes
.
Doing
it
before
the
mothers
'
eyes
was
what
gave
zest
*NL*
to
the
amusement
.
Here
is
another
scene
that
I
thought
very
interesting
.
*NL*
Imagine
a
trembling
mother
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
,
a
circle
of
invading
*NL*
Turks
around
her
.
They
've
planned
a
diversion
:
they
pet
the
baby
,
laugh
to
*NL*
make
it
laugh
.
They
succeed
,
the
baby
laughs
.
At
that
moment
a
Turk
points
*NL*
a
pistol
four
inches
from
the
baby
's
face
.
The
baby
laughs
with
glee
,
*NL*
holds
out
its
little
hands
to
the
pistol
,
and
he
pulls
the
trigger
in
the
*NL*
baby
's
face
and
blows
out
its
brains
.
Artistic
,
was
n't
it
?
By
the
way
,
*NL*
Turks
are
particularly
fond
of
sweet
things
,
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
what
are
you
driving
at
?
''
asked
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
if
the
devil
does
n't
exist
,
but
man
has
created
him
,
he
has
*NL*
created
him
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
he
did
God
,
then
?
''
observed
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
's
wonderful
how
you
can
turn
words
,
'
as
Polonius
says
in
_
Hamlet
_
,
''
*NL*
laughed
Ivan
.
``
You
turn
my
words
against
me
.
Well
,
I
am
glad
.
Yours
must
*NL*
be
a
fine
God
,
if
man
created
Him
in
his
image
and
likeness
.
You
asked
*NL*
just
now
what
I
was
driving
at
.
You
see
,
I
am
fond
of
collecting
certain
*NL*
facts
,
and
,
would
you
believe
,
I
even
copy
anecdotes
of
a
certain
sort
*NL*
from
newspapers
and
books
,
and
I
've
already
got
a
fine
collection
.
The
*NL*
Turks
,
of
course
,
have
gone
into
it
,
but
they
are
foreigners
.
I
have
*NL*
specimens
from
home
that
are
even
better
than
the
Turks
.
You
know
we
*NL*
prefer
beating
--
rods
and
scourges
--
that
's
our
national
institution
.
Nailing
*NL*
ears
is
unthinkable
for
us
,
for
we
are
,
after
all
,
Europeans
.
But
the
rod
*NL*
and
the
scourge
we
have
always
with
us
and
they
can
not
be
taken
from
us
.
*NL*
Abroad
now
they
scarcely
do
any
beating
.
Manners
are
more
humane
,
or
laws
*NL*
have
been
passed
,
so
that
they
do
n't
dare
to
flog
men
now
.
But
they
make
*NL*
up
for
it
in
another
way
just
as
national
as
ours
.
And
so
national
that
it
*NL*
would
be
practically
impossible
among
us
,
though
I
believe
we
are
being
*NL*
inoculated
with
it
,
since
the
religious
movement
began
in
our
aristocracy
.
*NL*
I
have
a
charming
pamphlet
,
translated
from
the
French
,
describing
how
,
*NL*
quite
recently
,
five
years
ago
,
a
murderer
,
Richard
,
was
executed
--
a
young
*NL*
man
,
I
believe
,
of
three
and
twenty
,
who
repented
and
was
converted
to
the
*NL*
Christian
faith
at
the
very
scaffold
.
This
Richard
was
an
illegitimate
*NL*
child
who
was
given
as
a
child
of
six
by
his
parents
to
some
shepherds
on
*NL*
the
Swiss
mountains
.
They
brought
him
up
to
work
for
them
.
He
grew
up
like
*NL*
a
little
wild
beast
among
them
.
The
shepherds
taught
him
nothing
,
and
*NL*
scarcely
fed
or
clothed
him
,
but
sent
him
out
at
seven
to
herd
the
flock
*NL*
in
cold
and
wet
,
and
no
one
hesitated
or
scrupled
to
treat
him
so
.
Quite
*NL*
the
contrary
,
they
thought
they
had
every
right
,
for
Richard
had
been
*NL*
given
to
them
as
a
chattel
,
and
they
did
not
even
see
the
necessity
of
*NL*
feeding
him
.
Richard
himself
describes
how
in
those
years
,
like
the
*NL*
Prodigal
Son
in
the
Gospel
,
he
longed
to
eat
of
the
mash
given
to
the
*NL*
pigs
,
which
were
fattened
for
sale
.
But
they
would
n't
even
give
him
that
,
*NL*
and
beat
him
when
he
stole
from
the
pigs
.
And
that
was
how
he
spent
all
*NL*
his
childhood
and
his
youth
,
till
he
grew
up
and
was
strong
enough
to
go
*NL*
away
and
be
a
thief
.
The
savage
began
to
earn
his
living
as
a
day
laborer
*NL*
in
Geneva
.
He
drank
what
he
earned
,
he
lived
like
a
brute
,
and
finished
by
*NL*
killing
and
robbing
an
old
man
.
He
was
caught
,
tried
,
and
condemned
to
*NL*
death
.
They
are
not
sentimentalists
there
.
And
in
prison
he
was
*NL*
immediately
surrounded
by
pastors
,
members
of
Christian
brotherhoods
,
*NL*
philanthropic
ladies
,
and
the
like
.
They
taught
him
to
read
and
write
in
*NL*
prison
,
and
expounded
the
Gospel
to
him
.
They
exhorted
him
,
worked
upon
*NL*
him
,
drummed
at
him
incessantly
,
till
at
last
he
solemnly
confessed
his
*NL*
crime
.
He
was
converted
.
He
wrote
to
the
court
himself
that
he
was
a
*NL*
monster
,
but
that
in
the
end
God
had
vouchsafed
him
light
and
shown
grace
.
*NL*
All
Geneva
was
in
excitement
about
him
--
all
philanthropic
and
religious
*NL*
Geneva
.
All
the
aristocratic
and
well-bred
society
of
the
town
rushed
to
*NL*
the
prison
,
kissed
Richard
and
embraced
him
;
`
You
are
our
brother
,
you
*NL*
have
found
grace
.
'
And
Richard
does
nothing
but
weep
with
emotion
,
`
Yes
,
*NL*
I
've
found
grace
!
All
my
youth
and
childhood
I
was
glad
of
pigs
'
food
,
but
*NL*
now
even
I
have
found
grace
.
I
am
dying
in
the
Lord
.
'
`
Yes
,
Richard
,
die
*NL*
in
the
Lord
;
you
have
shed
blood
and
must
die
.
Though
it
's
not
your
fault
*NL*
that
you
knew
not
the
Lord
,
when
you
coveted
the
pigs
'
food
and
were
*NL*
beaten
for
stealing
it
-LRB-
which
was
very
wrong
of
you
,
for
stealing
is
*NL*
forbidden
-RRB-
;
but
you
've
shed
blood
and
you
must
die
.
'
And
on
the
last
day
,
*NL*
Richard
,
perfectly
limp
,
did
nothing
but
cry
and
repeat
every
minute
:
*NL*
`
This
is
my
happiest
day
.
I
am
going
to
the
Lord
.
'
`
Yes
,
'
cry
the
pastors
*NL*
and
the
judges
and
philanthropic
ladies
.
`
This
is
the
happiest
day
of
your
*NL*
life
,
for
you
are
going
to
the
Lord
!
'
They
all
walk
or
drive
to
the
*NL*
scaffold
in
procession
behind
the
prison
van
.
At
the
scaffold
they
call
to
*NL*
Richard
:
`
Die
,
brother
,
die
in
the
Lord
,
for
even
thou
hast
found
grace
!
'
*NL*
And
so
,
covered
with
his
brothers
'
kisses
,
Richard
is
dragged
on
to
the
*NL*
scaffold
,
and
led
to
the
guillotine
.
And
they
chopped
off
his
head
in
*NL*
brotherly
fashion
,
because
he
had
found
grace
.
Yes
,
that
's
characteristic
.
*NL*
That
pamphlet
is
translated
into
Russian
by
some
Russian
philanthropists
*NL*
of
aristocratic
rank
and
evangelical
aspirations
,
and
has
been
distributed
*NL*
gratis
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
.
The
case
of
Richard
is
*NL*
interesting
because
it
's
national
.
Though
to
us
it
's
absurd
to
cut
off
a
*NL*
man
's
head
,
because
he
has
become
our
brother
and
has
found
grace
,
yet
we
*NL*
have
our
own
speciality
,
which
is
all
but
worse
.
Our
historical
pastime
is
*NL*
the
direct
satisfaction
of
inflicting
pain
.
There
are
lines
in
Nekrassov
*NL*
describing
how
a
peasant
lashes
a
horse
on
the
eyes
,
`
on
its
meek
eyes
,
'
*NL*
every
one
must
have
seen
it
.
It
's
peculiarly
Russian
.
He
describes
how
a
*NL*
feeble
little
nag
has
foundered
under
too
heavy
a
load
and
can
not
move
.
*NL*
The
peasant
beats
it
,
beats
it
savagely
,
beats
it
at
last
not
knowing
what
*NL*
he
is
doing
in
the
intoxication
of
cruelty
,
thrashes
it
mercilessly
over
*NL*
and
over
again
.
`
However
weak
you
are
,
you
must
pull
,
if
you
die
for
it
.
'
*NL*
The
nag
strains
,
and
then
he
begins
lashing
the
poor
defenseless
creature
*NL*
on
its
weeping
,
on
its
`
meek
eyes
.
'
The
frantic
beast
tugs
and
draws
the
*NL*
load
,
trembling
all
over
,
gasping
for
breath
,
moving
sideways
,
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
unnatural
spasmodic
action
--
it
's
awful
in
Nekrassov
.
But
that
's
only
a
*NL*
horse
,
and
God
has
given
horses
to
be
beaten
.
So
the
Tatars
have
taught
*NL*
us
,
and
they
left
us
the
knout
as
a
remembrance
of
it
.
But
men
,
too
,
can
*NL*
be
beaten
.
A
well-educated
,
cultured
gentleman
and
his
wife
beat
their
own
*NL*
child
with
a
birch-rod
,
a
girl
of
seven
.
I
have
an
exact
account
of
it
.
*NL*
The
papa
was
glad
that
the
birch
was
covered
with
twigs
.
`
It
stings
more
,
'
*NL*
said
he
,
and
so
he
began
stinging
his
daughter
.
I
know
for
a
fact
there
*NL*
are
people
who
at
every
blow
are
worked
up
to
sensuality
,
to
literal
*NL*
sensuality
,
which
increases
progressively
at
every
blow
they
inflict
.
They
*NL*
beat
for
a
minute
,
for
five
minutes
,
for
ten
minutes
,
more
often
and
more
*NL*
savagely
.
The
child
screams
.
At
last
the
child
can
not
scream
,
it
gasps
,
*NL*
`
Daddy
!
daddy
!
'
By
some
diabolical
unseemly
chance
the
case
was
brought
*NL*
into
court
.
A
counsel
is
engaged
.
The
Russian
people
have
long
called
a
*NL*
barrister
'
a
conscience
for
hire
.
'
The
counsel
protests
in
his
client
's
*NL*
defense
.
`
It
's
such
a
simple
thing
,
'
he
says
,
`
an
everyday
domestic
event
.
*NL*
A
father
corrects
his
child
.
To
our
shame
be
it
said
,
it
is
brought
into
*NL*
court
.
'
The
jury
,
convinced
by
him
,
give
a
favorable
verdict
.
The
public
*NL*
roars
with
delight
that
the
torturer
is
acquitted
.
Ah
,
pity
I
was
n't
*NL*
there
!
I
would
have
proposed
to
raise
a
subscription
in
his
honor
!
*NL*
Charming
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
still
better
things
about
children
.
I
've
collected
a
great
,
*NL*
great
deal
about
Russian
children
,
Alyosha
.
There
was
a
little
girl
of
*NL*
five
who
was
hated
by
her
father
and
mother
,
`
most
worthy
and
respectable
*NL*
people
,
of
good
education
and
breeding
.
'
You
see
,
I
must
repeat
again
,
it
*NL*
is
a
peculiar
characteristic
of
many
people
,
this
love
of
torturing
*NL*
children
,
and
children
only
.
To
all
other
types
of
humanity
these
*NL*
torturers
behave
mildly
and
benevolently
,
like
cultivated
and
humane
*NL*
Europeans
;
but
they
are
very
fond
of
tormenting
children
,
even
fond
of
*NL*
children
themselves
in
that
sense
.
It
's
just
their
defenselessness
that
*NL*
tempts
the
tormentor
,
just
the
angelic
confidence
of
the
child
who
has
no
*NL*
refuge
and
no
appeal
,
that
sets
his
vile
blood
on
fire
.
In
every
man
,
of
*NL*
course
,
a
demon
lies
hidden
--
the
demon
of
rage
,
the
demon
of
lustful
heat
*NL*
at
the
screams
of
the
tortured
victim
,
the
demon
of
lawlessness
let
off
*NL*
the
chain
,
the
demon
of
diseases
that
follow
on
vice
,
gout
,
kidney
*NL*
disease
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
poor
child
of
five
was
subjected
to
every
possible
torture
by
those
*NL*
cultivated
parents
.
They
beat
her
,
thrashed
her
,
kicked
her
for
no
reason
*NL*
till
her
body
was
one
bruise
.
Then
,
they
went
to
greater
refinements
of
*NL*
cruelty
--
shut
her
up
all
night
in
the
cold
and
frost
in
a
privy
,
and
*NL*
because
she
did
n't
ask
to
be
taken
up
at
night
-LRB-
as
though
a
child
of
five
*NL*
sleeping
its
angelic
,
sound
sleep
could
be
trained
to
wake
and
ask
-RRB-
,
they
*NL*
smeared
her
face
and
filled
her
mouth
with
excrement
,
and
it
was
her
*NL*
mother
,
her
mother
did
this
.
And
that
mother
could
sleep
,
hearing
the
poor
*NL*
child
's
groans
!
Can
you
understand
why
a
little
creature
,
who
ca
n't
even
*NL*
understand
what
's
done
to
her
,
should
beat
her
little
aching
heart
with
*NL*
her
tiny
fist
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
,
and
weep
her
meek
unresentful
*NL*
tears
to
dear
,
kind
God
to
protect
her
?
Do
you
understand
that
,
friend
and
*NL*
brother
,
you
pious
and
humble
novice
?
Do
you
understand
why
this
infamy
*NL*
must
be
and
is
permitted
?
Without
it
,
I
am
told
,
man
could
not
have
*NL*
existed
on
earth
,
for
he
could
not
have
known
good
and
evil
.
Why
should
he
*NL*
know
that
diabolical
good
and
evil
when
it
costs
so
much
?
Why
,
the
whole
*NL*
world
of
knowledge
is
not
worth
that
child
's
prayer
to
`
dear
,
kind
God
'
!
I
*NL*
say
nothing
of
the
sufferings
of
grown-up
people
,
they
have
eaten
the
*NL*
apple
,
damn
them

and
the

take
them
all

But
these
little
ones
!
I
am
*NL*
making
you
suffer

Alyosha

you
are
not

I
'll
leave
off
if
you
*NL*
like

``

those
days
a
general
of
aristocratic
connections
,
*NL*
the
owner
of
great
estates
,
one
of
those
men
--
somewhat
exceptional
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
even
then
--
who
,
retiring
from
the
service
into
a
life
of
leisure
,
*NL*
are
convinced
that
they
've
earned
absolute
power
over
the
lives
of
their
*NL*
subjects
.
There
were
such
men
then
.
So
our
general
,
settled
on
his
*NL*
property
of
two
thousand
souls
,
lives
in
pomp
,
and
domineers
over
his
poor
*NL*
neighbors
as
though
they
were
dependents
and
buffoons
.
He
has
kennels
of
*NL*
hundreds
of
hounds
and
nearly
a
hundred
dog-boys
--
all
mounted
,
and
in
*NL*
uniform
.
One
day
a
serf-boy
,
a
little
child
of
eight
,
threw
a
stone
in
*NL*
play
and
hurt
the
paw
of
the
general
's
favorite
hound
.
`
Why
is
my
favorite
*NL*
dog
lame
?
'
He
is
told
that
the
boy
threw
a
stone
that
hurt
the
dog
's
paw
.
*NL*
`
So
you
did
it
.
'
The
general
looked
the
child
up
and
down
.
`
Take
him
.
'
He
*NL*
was
taken
--
taken
from
his
mother
and
kept
shut
up
all
night
.
Early
that
*NL*
morning
the
general
comes
out
on
horseback
,
with
the
hounds
,
his
*NL*
dependents
,
dog-boys
,
and
huntsmen
,
all
mounted
around
him
in
full
hunting
*NL*
parade
.
The
servants
are
summoned
for
their
edification
,
and
in
front
of
*NL*
them
all
stands
the
mother
of
the
child
.
The
child
is
brought
from
the
*NL*
lock-up
.
It
's
a
gloomy
,
cold
,
foggy
autumn
day
,
a
capital
day
for
hunting
.
*NL*
The
general
orders
the
child
to
be
undressed
;
the
child
is
stripped
naked
.
*NL*
He
shivers
,
numb
with
terror
,
not
daring
to
cry
...
`
Make
him
run
,
'
*NL*
commands
the
general
.
`
Run
!
run
!
'
shout
the
dog-boys
.
The
boy
runs
...
`
At
*NL*
him
!
'
yells
the
general
,
and
he
sets
the
whole
pack
of
hounds
on
the
*NL*
child
.
The
hounds
catch
him
,
and
tear
him
to
pieces
before
his
mother
's
*NL*
eyes
!
...
I
believe
the
general
was
afterwards
declared
incapable
of
*NL*
administering
his
estates
.
Well
--
what
did
he
deserve
?
To
be
shot
?
To
be
*NL*
shot
for
the
satisfaction
of
our
moral
feelings
?
Speak
,
Alyosha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
shot
,
''
murmured
Alyosha
,
lifting
his
eyes
to
Ivan
with
a
pale
,
*NL*
twisted
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
cried
Ivan
,
delighted
.
``
If
even
you
say
so
...
You
're
a
pretty
*NL*
monk

So
there
is
a
little
devil
sitting
in
your
heart
,
Alyosha
*NL*
Karamazov
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
said
was
absurd
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
point
,
that
`

''
cried
Ivan
.
``
Let
me
tell
you
,
novice
,
*NL*
that
the
absurd
is
only
too
necessary

The
world
stands
on
*NL*
absurdities

and
perhaps
nothing
would
have
come
to

in
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

*NL*
*NL*

Ivan
went
on

as
though
in
delirium
.
``
I
do
n't
want
*NL*

I
want

up

long
ago

I
try

I
shall
be

I
have
determined

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
trying
me
?

Alyosha
cried
,
with
sudden
distress
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
say
what
you
mean
at
last

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
will

that

what
I
've
been
leading
up
to

me

I
do
n't

I
wo
n't
give

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
for
a
minute
was
silent
,
his
face
became
all
at
once
very
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
I
took
the
case
of
children
only
to
make
my
case
clearer
.
Of
the
*NL*
other
tears
of
humanity
with
which
the
earth
is
soaked
from
its
crust
to
*NL*
its
center
,
I
will
say
nothing
.
I
have
narrowed
my
subject
on
purpose
.
I
*NL*
am
a
bug
,
and
I
recognize
in
all
humility
that
I
can
not
understand
why
the
*NL*
world
is
arranged
as
it
is
.
Men
are
themselves
to
blame
,
I
suppose
;
they
*NL*
were
given
paradise
,
they
wanted
freedom
,
and
stole
fire
from
heaven
,
*NL*
though
they
knew
they
would
become
unhappy
,
so
there
is
no
need
to
pity
*NL*
them
.
With
my
pitiful
,
earthly
,
Euclidian
understanding
,
all
I
know
is
*NL*
that
there
is
suffering
and
that
there
are
none
guilty
;
that
cause
follows
*NL*
effect
,
simply
and
directly
;
that
everything
flows
and
finds
its
level
--
but
*NL*
that
's
only
Euclidian
nonsense
,
I
know
that
,
and
I
ca
n't
consent
to
live
*NL*
by
it
!
What
comfort
is
it
to
me
that
there
are
none
guilty
and
that
cause
*NL*
follows
effect
simply
and
directly
,
and
that
I
know
it
?
--
I
must
have
*NL*
justice
,
or
I
will
destroy
myself
.
And
not
justice
in
some
remote
infinite
*NL*
time
and
space
,
but
here
on
earth
,
and
that
I
could
see
myself
.
I
have
*NL*
believed
in
it
.
I
want
to
see
it
,
and
if
I
am
dead
by
then
,
let
me
rise
*NL*
again
,
for
if
it
all
happens
without
me
,
it
will
be
too
unfair
.
Surely
I
*NL*
have
n't
suffered
,
simply
that
I
,
my
crimes
and
my
sufferings
,
may
manure
*NL*
the
soil
of
the
future
harmony
for
somebody
else
.
I
want
to
see
with
my
*NL*
own
eyes
the
hind
lie
down
with
the
lion
and
the
victim
rise
up
and
*NL*
embrace
his
murderer
.
I
want
to
be
there
when
every
one
suddenly
*NL*
understands
what
it
has
all
been
for
.
All
the
religions
of
the
world
are
*NL*
built
on
this
longing
,
and
I
am
a
believer
.
But
then
there
are
the
*NL*
children
,
and
what
am
I
to
do
about
them
?
That
's
a
question
I
ca
n't
*NL*
answer
.
For
the
hundredth
time
I
repeat
,
there
are
numbers
of
questions
,
*NL*
but
I
've
only
taken
the
children
,
because
in
their
case
what
I
mean
is
so
*NL*
unanswerably
clear
.
Listen
!
If
all
must
suffer
to
pay
for
the
eternal
*NL*
harmony
,
what
have
children
to
do
with
it
,
tell
me
,
please
?
It
's
beyond
*NL*
all
comprehension
why
they
should
suffer
,
and
why
they
should
pay
for
the
*NL*
harmony
.
Why
should
they
,
too
,
furnish
material
to
enrich
the
soil
for
the
*NL*
harmony
of
the
future
?
I
understand
solidarity
in
sin
among
men
.
I
*NL*
understand
solidarity
in
retribution
,
too
;
but
there
can
be
no
such
*NL*
solidarity
with
children
.
And
if
it
is
really
true
that
they
must
share
*NL*
responsibility
for
all
their
fathers
'
crimes
,
such
a
truth
is
not
of
this
*NL*
world
and
is
beyond
my
comprehension
.
Some
jester
will
say
,
perhaps
,
that
*NL*
the
child
would
have
grown
up
and
have
sinned
,
but
you
see
he
did
n't
grow
*NL*
up
,
he
was
torn
to
pieces
by
the
dogs
,
at
eight
years
old
.
Oh
,
Alyosha
,
I
*NL*
am
not
blaspheming
!
I
understand
,
of
course
,
what
an
upheaval
of
the
*NL*
universe
it
will
be
,
when
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
blends
in
one
*NL*
hymn
of
praise
and
everything
that
lives
and
has
lived
cries
aloud
:
`
Thou
*NL*
art
just
,
O
Lord
,
for
Thy
ways
are
revealed
.
'
When
the
mother
embraces
the
*NL*
fiend
who
threw
her
child
to
the
dogs
,
and
all
three
cry
aloud
with
tears
,
*NL*
`
Thou
art
just
,
O
Lord
!
'
then
,
of
course
,
the
crown
of
knowledge
will
be
*NL*
reached
and
all
will
be
made
clear
.
But
what
pulls
me
up
here
is
that
I
*NL*
ca
n't
accept
that
harmony
.
And
while
I
am
on
earth
,
I
make
haste
to
take
*NL*
my
own
measures
.
You
see
,
Alyosha
,
perhaps
it
really
may
happen
that
if
I
*NL*
live
to
that
moment
,
or
rise
again
to
see
it
,
I
,
too
,
perhaps
,
may
cry
*NL*
aloud
with
the
rest
,
looking
at
the
mother
embracing
the
child
's
torturer
,
*NL*
`
Thou
art
just
,
O
Lord
!
'
but
I
do
n't
want
to
cry
aloud
then
.
While
there
*NL*
is
still
time
,
I
hasten
to
protect
myself
,
and
so
I
renounce
the
higher
*NL*
harmony
altogether
.
It
's
not
worth
the
tears
of
that
one
tortured
child
*NL*
who
beat
itself
on
the
breast
with
its
little
fist
and
prayed
in
its
*NL*
stinking
outhouse
,
with
its
unexpiated
tears
to
`
dear
,
kind
God
'
!
It
's
not
*NL*
worth
it
,
because
those
tears
are
unatoned
for
.
They
must
be
atoned
for
,
*NL*
or
there
can
be
no
harmony
.
But
how
?
How
are
you
going
to
atone
for
them
?
*NL*
Is
it
possible
?
By
their
being
avenged
?
But
what
do
I
care
for
avenging
*NL*
them
?
What
do
I
care
for
a
hell
for
oppressors
?
What
good
can
hell
do
,
*NL*
since
those
children
have
already
been
tortured
?
And
what
becomes
of
*NL*
harmony
,
if
there
is
hell
?
I
want
to
forgive
.
I
want
to
embrace
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
more
suffering
.
And
if
the
sufferings
of
children
go
to
swell
the
sum
*NL*
of
sufferings
which
was
necessary
to
pay
for
truth
,
then
I
protest
that
*NL*
the
truth
is
not
worth
such
a
price
.
I
do
n't
want
the
mother
to
embrace
*NL*
the
oppressor
who
threw
her
son
to
the
dogs
!
She
dare
not
forgive
him
!
Let
*NL*
her
forgive
him
for
herself
,
if
she
will
,
let
her
forgive
the
torturer
for
*NL*
the
immeasurable
suffering
of
her
mother
's
heart
.
But
the
sufferings
of
*NL*
her
tortured
child
she
has
no
right
to
forgive
;
she
dare
not
forgive
the
*NL*
torturer
,
even
if
the
child
were
to
forgive
him
!
And
if
that
is
so
,
if
*NL*
they
dare
not
forgive
,
what
becomes
of
harmony
?
Is
there
in
the
whole
*NL*
world
a
being
who
would
have
the
right
to
forgive
and
could
forgive
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
harmony
.
From
love
for
humanity
I
do
n't
want
it
.
I
would
rather
*NL*
be
left
with
the
unavenged
suffering
.
I
would
rather
remain
with
my
*NL*
unavenged
suffering
and
unsatisfied
indignation
,
_
even
if
I
were
wrong
_
.
*NL*
Besides
,
too
high
a
price
is
asked
for
harmony
;
it
's
beyond
our
means
to
*NL*
pay
so
much
to
enter
on
it
.
And
so
I
hasten
to
give
back
my
entrance
*NL*
ticket
,
and
if
I
am
an
honest
man
I
am
bound
to
give
it
back
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
And
that
I
am
doing
.
It
's
not
God
that
I
do
n't
accept
,
Alyosha
,
*NL*
only
I
most
respectfully
return
Him
the
ticket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
rebellion

murmured
Alyosha
,
looking
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rebellion

I
am
sorry
you
call
it
that

Ivan
earnestly
.
``

hardly

happy

that

tiny
creature

beating
its

Alyosha
softly

idea

Chapter
V
.
The
Grand
Inquisitor
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
this
must
have
a
preface
--
that
is
,
a
literary
preface
,
''
laughed
Ivan
,
*NL*
``
and
I
am
a
poor
hand
at
making
one
.
You
see
,
my
action
takes
place
in
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
,
and
at
that
time
,
as
you
probably
learnt
at
school
,
it
*NL*
was
customary
in
poetry
to
bring
down
heavenly
powers
on
earth
.
Not
to
*NL*
speak
of
Dante
,
in
France
,
clerks
,
as
well
as
the
monks
in
the
*NL*
monasteries
,
used
to
give
regular
performances
in
which
the
Madonna
,
the
*NL*
saints
,
the
angels
,
Christ
,
and
God
himself
were
brought
on
the
stage
.
In
*NL*
those
days
it
was
done
in
all
simplicity
.
In
Victor
Hugo
's
_
Notre
Dame
de
*NL*
Paris
_
an
edifying
and
gratuitous
spectacle
was
provided
for
the
people
in
*NL*
the
Hotel
de
Ville
of
Paris
in
the
reign
of
Louis
XI
.
in
honor
of
the
*NL*
birth
of
the
dauphin
.
It
was
called
_
Le
bon
jugement
de
la
tres
sainte
et
*NL*
gracieuse
Vierge
Marie
_
,
and
she
appears
herself
on
the
stage
and
*NL*
pronounces
her
_
bon
jugement
_
.
Similar
plays
,
chiefly
from
the
Old
*NL*
Testament
,
were
occasionally
performed
in
Moscow
too
,
up
to
the
times
of
*NL*
Peter
the
Great
.
But
besides
plays
there
were
all
sorts
of
legends
and
*NL*
ballads
scattered
about
the
world
,
in
which
the
saints
and
angels
and
all
*NL*
the
powers
of
Heaven
took
part
when
required
.
In
our
monasteries
the
monks
*NL*
busied
themselves
in
translating
,
copying
,
and
even
composing
such
*NL*
poems
--
and
even
under
the
Tatars
.
There
is
,
for
instance
,
one
such
poem
-LRB-
of
*NL*
course
,
from
the
Greek
-RRB-
,
_
The
Wanderings
of
Our
Lady
through
Hell
_
,
with
*NL*
descriptions
as
bold
as
Dante
's
.
Our
Lady
visits
hell
,
and
the
Archangel
*NL*
Michael
leads
her
through
the
torments
.
She
sees
the
sinners
and
their
*NL*
punishment
.
There
she
sees
among
others
one
noteworthy
set
of
sinners
in
a
*NL*
burning
lake
;
some
of
them
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
so
that
they
*NL*
ca
n't
swim
out
,
and
`
these
God
forgets
'
--
an
expression
of
extraordinary
*NL*
depth
and
force
.
And
so
Our
Lady
,
shocked
and
weeping
,
falls
before
the
*NL*
throne
of
God
and
begs
for
mercy
for
all
in
hell
--
for
all
she
has
seen
*NL*
there
,
indiscriminately
.
Her
conversation
with
God
is
immensely
*NL*
interesting
.
She
beseeches
Him
,
she
will
not
desist
,
and
when
God
points
*NL*
to
the
hands
and
feet
of
her
Son
,
nailed
to
the
Cross
,
and
asks
,
`
How
can
*NL*
I
forgive
His
tormentors
?
'
she
bids
all
the
saints
,
all
the
martyrs
,
all
*NL*
the
angels
and
archangels
to
fall
down
with
her
and
pray
for
mercy
on
all
*NL*
without
distinction
.
It
ends
by
her
winning
from
God
a
respite
of
*NL*
suffering
every
year
from
Good
Friday
till
Trinity
Day
,
and
the
sinners
at
*NL*
once
raise
a
cry
of
thankfulness
from
hell
,
chanting
,
`
Thou
art
just
,
O
*NL*
Lord
,
in
this
judgment
.
'
Well
,
my
poem
would
have
been
of
that
kind
if
it
*NL*
had
appeared
at
that
time
.
He
comes
on
the
scene
in
my
poem
,
but
He
says
*NL*
nothing
,
only
appears
and
passes
on
.
Fifteen
centuries
have
passed
since
*NL*
He
promised
to
come
in
His
glory
,
fifteen
centuries
since
His
prophet
*NL*
wrote
,
`
Behold
,
I
come
quickly
'
;
`
Of
that
day
and
that
hour
knoweth
no
*NL*
man
,
neither
the
Son
,
but
the
Father
,
'
as
He
Himself
predicted
on
earth
.
*NL*
But
humanity
awaits
him
with
the
same
faith
and
with
the
same
love
.
Oh
,
*NL*
with
greater
faith
,
for
it
is
fifteen
centuries
since
man
has
ceased
to
*NL*
see
signs
from
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
signs
from
heaven
come
to-day
*NL*
To
add
to
what
the
heart
doth
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
left
but
faith
in
what
the
heart
doth
say
.
It
is
true
*NL*
there
were
many
miracles
in
those
days
.
There
were
saints
who
performed
*NL*
miraculous
cures
;
some
holy
people
,
according
to
their
biographies
,
were
*NL*
visited
by
the
Queen
of
Heaven
herself
.
But
the
devil
did
not
slumber
,
and
*NL*
doubts
were
already
arising
among
men
of
the
truth
of
these
miracles
.
And
*NL*
just
then
there
appeared
in
the
north
of
Germany
a
terrible
new
heresy
.
``
A
*NL*
huge
star
like
to
a
torch
''
-LRB-
that
is
,
to
a
church
-RRB-
``
fell
on
the
sources
of
*NL*
the
waters
and
they
became
bitter
.
''
These
heretics
began
blasphemously
*NL*
denying
miracles
.
But
those
who
remained
faithful
were
all
the
more
ardent
*NL*
in
their
faith
.
The
tears
of
humanity
rose
up
to
Him
as
before
,
awaited
*NL*
His
coming
,
loved
Him
,
hoped
for
Him
,
yearned
to
suffer
and
die
for
Him
as
*NL*
before
.
And
so
many
ages
mankind
had
prayed
with
faith
and
fervor
,
``
O
Lord
*NL*
our
God
,
hasten
Thy
coming
,
''
so
many
ages
called
upon
Him
,
that
in
His
*NL*
infinite
mercy
He
deigned
to
come
down
to
His
servants
.
Before
that
day
He
*NL*
had
come
down
,
He
had
visited
some
holy
men
,
martyrs
and
hermits
,
as
is
*NL*
written
in
their
lives
.
Among
us
,
Tyutchev
,
with
absolute
faith
in
the
*NL*
truth
of
his
words
,
bore
witness
that
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bearing
the
Cross
,
in
slavish
dress
,
*NL*
Weary
and
worn
,
the
Heavenly
King
*NL*
Our
mother
,
Russia
,
came
to
bless
,
*NL*
And
through
our
land
went
wandering
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
certainly
was
so
,
I
assure
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
behold
,
He
deigned
to
appear
for
a
moment
to
the
people
,
to
the
*NL*
tortured
,
suffering
people
,
sunk
in
iniquity
,
but
loving
Him
like
*NL*
children
.
My
story
is
laid
in
Spain
,
in
Seville
,
in
the
most
terrible
time
*NL*
of
the
Inquisition
,
when
fires
were
lighted
every
day
to
the
glory
of
God
,
*NL*
and
`
in
the
splendid
_
auto
da
fe
_
the
wicked
heretics
were
burnt
.
'
Oh
,
of
*NL*
course
,
this
was
not
the
coming
in
which
He
will
appear
according
to
His
*NL*
promise
at
the
end
of
time
in
all
His
heavenly
glory
,
and
which
will
be
*NL*
sudden
`
as
lightning
flashing
from
east
to
west
.
'
No
,
He
visited
His
*NL*
children
only
for
a
moment
,
and
there
where
the
flames
were
crackling
*NL*
round
the
heretics
.
In
His
infinite
mercy
He
came
once
more
among
men
in
*NL*
that
human
shape
in
which
He
walked
among
men
for
three
years
fifteen
*NL*
centuries
ago
.
He
came
down
to
the
`
hot
pavements
'
of
the
southern
town
in
*NL*
which
on
the
day
before
almost
a
hundred
heretics
had
,
_
ad
majorem
gloriam
*NL*
Dei
_
,
been
burnt
by
the
cardinal
,
the
Grand
Inquisitor
,
in
a
magnificent
*NL*
_
auto
da
fe
_
,
in
the
presence
of
the
king
,
the
court
,
the
knights
,
the
*NL*
cardinals
,
the
most
charming
ladies
of
the
court
,
and
the
whole
population
*NL*
of
Seville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
softly
,
unobserved
,
and
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
every
one
recognized
*NL*
Him
.
That
might
be
one
of
the
best
passages
in
the
poem
.
I
mean
,
why
they
*NL*
recognized
Him
.
The
people
are
irresistibly
drawn
to
Him
,
they
surround
*NL*
Him
,
they
flock
about
Him
,
follow
Him
.
He
moves
silently
in
their
midst
*NL*
with
a
gentle
smile
of
infinite
compassion
.
The
sun
of
love
burns
in
His
*NL*
heart
,
light
and
power
shine
from
His
eyes
,
and
their
radiance
,
shed
on
*NL*
the
people
,
stirs
their
hearts
with
responsive
love
.
He
holds
out
His
*NL*
hands
to
them
,
blesses
them
,
and
a
healing
virtue
comes
from
contact
with
*NL*
Him
,
even
with
His
garments
.
An
old
man
in
the
crowd
,
blind
from
*NL*
childhood
,
cries
out
,
'
O
Lord
,
heal
me
and
I
shall
see
Thee
!
'
and
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
scales
fall
from
his
eyes
and
the
blind
man
sees
Him
.
The
crowd
*NL*
weeps
and
kisses
the
earth
under
His
feet
.
Children
throw
flowers
before
*NL*
Him
,
sing
,
and
cry
hosannah
.
`
It
is
He
--
it
is
He
!
'
all
repeat
.
`
It
must
be
*NL*
He
,
it
can
be
no
one
but
Him
!
'
He
stops
at
the
steps
of
the
Seville
*NL*
cathedral
at
the
moment
when
the
weeping
mourners
are
bringing
in
a
little
*NL*
open
white
coffin
.
In
it
lies
a
child
of
seven
,
the
only
daughter
of
a
*NL*
prominent
citizen
.
The
dead
child
lies
hidden
in
flowers
.
`
He
will
raise
*NL*
your
child
,
'
the
crowd
shouts
to
the
weeping
mother
.
The
priest
,
coming
to
*NL*
meet
the
coffin
,
looks
perplexed
,
and
frowns
,
but
the
mother
of
the
dead
*NL*
child
throws
herself
at
His
feet
with
a
wail
.
`
If
it
is
Thou
,
raise
my
*NL*
child
!
'
she
cries
,
holding
out
her
hands
to
Him
.
The
procession
halts
,
the
*NL*
coffin
is
laid
on
the
steps
at
His
feet
.
He
looks
with
compassion
,
and
His
*NL*
lips
once
more
softly
pronounce
,
`
Maiden
,
arise
!
'
and
the
maiden
arises
.
*NL*
The
little
girl
sits
up
in
the
coffin
and
looks
round
,
smiling
with
wide
-
*NL*
open
wondering
eyes
,
holding
a
bunch
of
white
roses
they
had
put
in
her
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
cries
,
sobs
,
confusion
among
the
people
,
and
at
that
moment
the
*NL*
cardinal
himself
,
the
Grand
Inquisitor
,
passes
by
the
cathedral
.
He
is
an
*NL*
old
man
,
almost
ninety
,
tall
and
erect
,
with
a
withered
face
and
sunken
*NL*
eyes
,
in
which
there
is
still
a
gleam
of
light
.
He
is
not
dressed
in
his
*NL*
gorgeous
cardinal
's
robes
,
as
he
was
the
day
before
,
when
he
was
burning
*NL*
the
enemies
of
the
Roman
Church
--
at
this
moment
he
is
wearing
his
coarse
,
*NL*
old
,
monk
's
cassock
.
At
a
distance
behind
him
come
his
gloomy
assistants
*NL*
and
slaves
and
the
`
holy
guard
.
'
He
stops
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
and
*NL*
watches
it
from
a
distance
.
He
sees
everything
;
he
sees
them
set
the
*NL*
coffin
down
at
His
feet
,
sees
the
child
rise
up
,
and
his
face
darkens
.
He
*NL*
knits
his
thick
gray
brows
and
his
eyes
gleam
with
a
sinister
fire
.
He
*NL*
holds
out
his
finger
and
bids
the
guards
take
Him
.
And
such
is
his
power
,
*NL*
so
completely
are
the
people
cowed
into
submission
and
trembling
obedience
*NL*
to
him
,
that
the
crowd
immediately
makes
way
for
the
guards
,
and
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
deathlike
silence
they
lay
hands
on
Him
and
lead
Him
away
.
The
*NL*
crowd
instantly
bows
down
to
the
earth
,
like
one
man
,
before
the
old
*NL*
Inquisitor
.
He
blesses
the
people
in
silence
and
passes
on
.
The
guards
*NL*
lead
their
prisoner
to
the
close
,
gloomy
vaulted
prison
in
the
ancient
*NL*
palace
of
the
Holy
Inquisition
and
shut
Him
in
it
.
The
day
passes
and
is
*NL*
followed
by
the
dark
,
burning
,
`
breathless
'
night
of
Seville
.
The
air
is
*NL*
`
fragrant
with
laurel
and
lemon
.
'
In
the
pitch
darkness
the
iron
door
of
*NL*
the
prison
is
suddenly
opened
and
the
Grand
Inquisitor
himself
comes
in
*NL*
with
a
light
in
his
hand
.
He
is
alone
;
the
door
is
closed
at
once
behind
*NL*
him
.
He
stands
in
the
doorway
and
for
a
minute
or
two
gazes
into
His
face
.
*NL*
At
last
he
goes
up
slowly
,
sets
the
light
on
the
table
and
speaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Is
it
Thou
?
Thou
?
'
but
receiving
no
answer
,
he
adds
at
once
,
`
Do
n't
*NL*
answer
,
be
silent
.
What
canst
Thou
say
,
indeed
?
I
know
too
well
what
Thou
*NL*
wouldst
say
.
And
Thou
hast
no
right
to
add
anything
to
what
Thou
hadst
*NL*
said
of
old
.
Why
,
then
,
art
Thou
come
to
hinder
us
?
For
Thou
hast
come
to
*NL*
hinder
us
,
and
Thou
knowest
that
.
But
dost
Thou
know
what
will
be
to
-
*NL*
morrow
?
I
know
not
who
Thou
art
and
care
not
to
know
whether
it
is
Thou
or
*NL*
only
a
semblance
of
Him
,
but
to-morrow
I
shall
condemn
Thee
and
burn
Thee
*NL*
at
the
stake
as
the
worst
of
heretics
.
And
the
very
people
who
have
to-day
*NL*
kissed
Thy
feet
,
to-morrow
at
the
faintest
sign
from
me
will
rush
to
heap
*NL*
up
the
embers
of
Thy
fire

Knowest
Thou
that
?
Yes

maybe
Thou
knowest
it

added
with
thoughtful
penetration

never
for

taking
his
eyes
*NL*
off
the
Prisoner

If
you
like
it
to
be
a
*NL*
case
of
mistaken
identity
,
let
it
be
so
.
It
is
true
,
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
laughing
,
``
the
old
man
was
ninety
,
and
he
might
well
be
crazy
over
his
set
*NL*
idea
.
He
might
have
been
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
Prisoner
.
It
*NL*
might
,
in
fact
,
be
simply
his
ravings
,
the
delusion
of
an
old
man
of
*NL*
ninety
,
over-excited
by
the
_
auto
da
fe
_
of
a
hundred
heretics
the
day
*NL*
before
.
But
does
it
matter
to
us
after
all
whether
it
was
a
mistake
of
*NL*
identity
or
a
wild
fantasy
?
All
that
matters
is
that
the
old
man
should
*NL*
speak
out
,
should
speak
openly
of
what
he
has
thought
in
silence
for
*NL*
ninety
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
Prisoner
too
is
silent
?
Does
He
look
at
him
and
not
say
a
word
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
inevitable
in
any
case

Ivan
laughed
again
.
``
The
old
man
has
told

Him

has
n't
the
right

add
anything
to
what

One
*NL*
may
say
it
is
the
most
fundamental

of
Roman
Catholicism

in

opinion

`
All
has
been
given

That
's
how
they
speak
and
write
too

the
Jesuits
,
at
any
rate

I
have
read
*NL*
it
myself
in
the
works
of
their
theologians
.
`
Hast
Thou
the
right
to
*NL*
reveal
to
us
one
of
the
mysteries
of
that
world
from
which
Thou
hast
*NL*
come
?
'
my
old
man
asks
Him
,
and
answers
the
question
for
Him
.
`
No
,
Thou
*NL*
hast
not
;
that
Thou
mayest
not
add
to
what
has
been
said
of
old
,
and
*NL*
mayest
not
take
from
men
the
freedom
which
Thou
didst
exalt
when
Thou
wast
*NL*
on
earth
.
Whatsoever
Thou
revealest
anew
will
encroach
on
men
's
freedom
of
*NL*
faith
;
for
it
will
be
manifest
as
a
miracle
,
and
the
freedom
of
their
*NL*
faith
was
dearer
to
Thee
than
anything
in
those
days
fifteen
hundred
years
*NL*
ago
.
Didst
Thou
not
often
say
then
,
``
I
will
make
you
free
''
?
But
now
Thou
*NL*
hast
seen
these
``
free
''
men

'
the
old
man
adds
suddenly
,
with
a
pensive
*NL*
smile
.
`
Yes
,
we
've
paid
dearly
for
it

he
goes
on
,
looking
sternly
at
*NL*
Him
,
`
but
at
last
we
have
completed
that
work
in
Thy
name
.
For
fifteen
*NL*
centuries
we
have
been
wrestling
with
Thy
freedom
,
but
now
it
is
ended
and
*NL*
over
for
good

Dost
Thou
not
believe
that
it
's
over
for
good
?
Thou
lookest
*NL*
meekly
at
me
and
deignest
not
even
to
be
wroth
with
me
.
But
let
me
tell
*NL*
Thee
that
now
,
to-day
,
people
are
more
persuaded
than
ever
that
they
have
*NL*
perfect
freedom
,
yet
they
have
brought
their
freedom
to
us
and
laid
it
*NL*
humbly
at
our
feet
.
But
that
has
been
our
doing

Was
this
what
Thou
didst
?

Was
this
Thy
freedom

Thou
*NL*
canst
not
think
of
taking
it
away
.
Why
,
then
,
hast
Thou
come
to
hinder
*NL*
us
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
's
the
meaning
of
`
no
lack
of
admonitions
and
warnings
'
?
''
asked
*NL*
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
the
chief
part
of
what
the
old
man
must
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
wise
and
dread
spirit
,
the
spirit
of
self-destruction
and
non
-
*NL*
existence
,
'
the
old
man
goes
on
,
`
the
great
spirit
talked
with
Thee
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
,
and
we
are
told
in
the
books
that
he
``
tempted
''
Thee
.
Is
that
*NL*
so
?
And
could
anything
truer
be
said
than
what
he
revealed
to
Thee
in
*NL*
three
questions
and
what
Thou
didst
reject
,
and
what
in
the
books
is
*NL*
called
``
the
temptation
''
?
And
yet
if
there
has
ever
been
on
earth
a
real
*NL*
stupendous
miracle
,
it
took
place
on
that
day
,
on
the
day
of
the
three
*NL*
temptations
.
The
statement
of
those
three
questions
was
itself
the
*NL*
miracle
.
If
it
were
possible
to
imagine
simply
for
the
sake
of
argument
*NL*
that
those
three
questions
of
the
dread
spirit
had
perished
utterly
from
*NL*
the
books
,
and
that
we
had
to
restore
them
and
to
invent
them
anew
,
and
to
*NL*
do
so
had
gathered
together
all
the
wise
men
of
the
earth
--
rulers
,
chief
*NL*
priests
,
learned
men
,
philosophers
,
poets
--
and
had
set
them
the
task
to
*NL*
invent
three
questions
,
such
as
would
not
only
fit
the
occasion
,
but
*NL*
express
in
three
words
,
three
human
phrases
,
the
whole
future
history
of
*NL*
the
world
and
of
humanity
--
dost
Thou
believe
that
all
the
wisdom
of
the
*NL*
earth
united
could
have
invented
anything
in
depth
and
force
equal
to
the
*NL*
three
questions
which
were
actually
put
to
Thee
then
by
the
wise
and
*NL*
mighty
spirit
in
the
wilderness
?
From
those
questions
alone
,
from
the
*NL*
miracle
of
their
statement
,
we
can
see
that
we
have
here
to
do
not
with
*NL*
the
fleeting
human
intelligence
,
but
with
the
absolute
and
eternal
.
For
in
*NL*
those
three
questions
the
whole
subsequent
history
of
mankind
is
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
brought
together
into
one
whole
,
and
foretold
,
and
in
them
are
*NL*
united
all
the
unsolved
historical
contradictions
of
human
nature
.
At
the
*NL*
time
it
could
not
be
so
clear
,
since
the
future
was
unknown
;
but
now
that
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
years
have
passed
,
we
see
that
everything
in
those
three
*NL*
questions
was
so
justly
divined
and
foretold
,
and
has
been
so
truly
*NL*
fulfilled
,
that
nothing
can
be
added
to
them
or
taken
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Judge
Thyself
who
was
right
--
Thou
or
he
who
questioned
Thee
then
?
*NL*
Remember
the
first
question
;
its
meaning
,
in
other
words
,
was
this
:
``
Thou
*NL*
wouldst
go
into
the
world
,
and
art
going
with
empty
hands
,
with
some
*NL*
promise
of
freedom
which
men
in
their
simplicity
and
their
natural
*NL*
unruliness
can
not
even
understand
,
which
they
fear
and
dread
--
for
nothing
*NL*
has
ever
been
more
insupportable
for
a
man
and
a
human
society
than
*NL*
freedom
.
But
seest
Thou
these
stones
in
this
parched
and
barren
*NL*
wilderness
?
Turn
them
into
bread
,
and
mankind
will
run
after
Thee
like
a
*NL*
flock
of
sheep
,
grateful
and
obedient
,
though
for
ever
trembling
,
lest
*NL*
Thou
withdraw
Thy
hand
and
deny
them
Thy
bread
.
''
But
Thou
wouldst
not
*NL*
deprive
man
of
freedom
and
didst
reject
the
offer
,
thinking
,
what
is
that
*NL*
freedom
worth
,
if
obedience
is
bought
with
bread
?
Thou
didst
reply
that
*NL*
man
lives
not
by
bread
alone
.
But
dost
Thou
know
that
for
the
sake
of
that
*NL*
earthly
bread
the
spirit
of
the
earth
will
rise
up
against
Thee
and
will
*NL*
strive
with
Thee
and
overcome
Thee
,
and
all
will
follow
him
,
crying
,
``
Who
*NL*
can
compare
with
this
beast
?
He
has
given
us
fire
from
heaven
!
''
Dost
Thou
*NL*
know
that
the
ages
will
pass
,
and
humanity
will
proclaim
by
the
lips
of
*NL*
their
sages
that
there
is
no
crime
,
and
therefore
no
sin
;
there
is
only
*NL*
hunger
?
``
Feed
men
,
and
then
ask
of
them
virtue
!
''
that
's
what
they
'll
write
*NL*
on
the
banner
,
which
they
will
raise
against
Thee
,
and
with
which
they
*NL*
will
destroy
Thy
temple
.
Where
Thy
temple
stood
will
rise
a
new
building
;
*NL*
the
terrible
tower
of
Babel
will
be
built
again
,
and
though
,
like
the
one
*NL*
of
old
,
it
will
not
be
finished
,
yet
Thou
mightest
have
prevented
that
new
*NL*
tower
and
have
cut
short
the
sufferings
of
men
for
a
thousand
years
;
for
*NL*
they
will
come
back
to
us
after
a
thousand
years
of
agony
with
their
*NL*
tower
.
They
will
seek
us
again
,
hidden
underground
in
the
catacombs
,
for
*NL*
we
shall
be
again
persecuted
and
tortured
.
They
will
find
us
and
cry
to
*NL*
us
,
``
Feed
us
,
for
those
who
have
promised
us
fire
from
heaven
have
n't
*NL*
given
it
!
''
And
then
we
shall
finish
building
their
tower
,
for
he
finishes
*NL*
the
building
who
feeds
them
.
And
we
alone
shall
feed
them
in
Thy
name
,
*NL*
declaring
falsely
that
it
is
in
Thy
name
.
Oh
,
never
,
never
can
they
feed
*NL*
themselves
without
us
!
No
science
will
give
them
bread
so
long
as
they
*NL*
remain
free
.
In
the
end
they
will
lay
their
freedom
at
our
feet
,
and
say
*NL*
to
us
,
``
Make
us
your
slaves
,
but
feed
us
.
''
They
will
understand
*NL*
themselves
,
at
last
,
that
freedom
and
bread
enough
for
all
are
*NL*
inconceivable
together
,
for
never
,
never
will
they
be
able
to
share
*NL*
between
them
!
They
will
be
convinced
,
too
,
that
they
can
never
be
free
,
*NL*
for
they
are
weak
,
vicious
,
worthless
and
rebellious
.
Thou
didst
promise
*NL*
them
the
bread
of
Heaven
,
but
,
I
repeat
again
,
can
it
compare
with
earthly
*NL*
bread
in
the
eyes
of
the
weak
,
ever
sinful
and
ignoble
race
of
man
?
And
if
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
the
bread
of
Heaven
thousands
shall
follow
Thee
,
what
is
*NL*
to
become
of
the
millions
and
tens
of
thousands
of
millions
of
creatures
*NL*
who
will
not
have
the
strength
to
forego
the
earthly
bread
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
the
heavenly
?
Or
dost
Thou
care
only
for
the
tens
of
thousands
of
the
*NL*
great
and
strong
,
while
the
millions
,
numerous
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
who
are
weak
but
love
Thee
,
must
exist
only
for
the
sake
of
the
great
and
*NL*
strong
?
No
,
we
care
for
the
weak
too
.
They
are
sinful
and
rebellious
,
but
*NL*
in
the
end
they
too
will
become
obedient
.
They
will
marvel
at
us
and
look
*NL*
on
us
as
gods
,
because
we
are
ready
to
endure
the
freedom
which
they
have
*NL*
found
so
dreadful
and
to
rule
over
them
--
so
awful
it
will
seem
to
them
to
*NL*
be
free
.
But
we
shall
tell
them
that
we
are
Thy
servants
and
rule
them
in
*NL*
Thy
name
.
We
shall
deceive
them
again
,
for
we
will
not
let
Thee
come
to
us
*NL*
again
.
That
deception
will
be
our
suffering
,
for
we
shall
be
forced
to
*NL*
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
This
is
the
significance
of
the
first
question
in
the
wilderness
,
and
*NL*
this
is
what
Thou
hast
rejected
for
the
sake
of
that
freedom
which
Thou
*NL*
hast
exalted
above
everything
.
Yet
in
this
question
lies
hid
the
great
*NL*
secret
of
this
world
.
Choosing
``
bread
,
''
Thou
wouldst
have
satisfied
the
*NL*
universal
and
everlasting
craving
of
humanity
--
to
find
some
one
to
worship
.
*NL*
So
long
as
man
remains
free
he
strives
for
nothing
so
incessantly
and
so
*NL*
painfully
as
to
find
some
one
to
worship
.
But
man
seeks
to
worship
what
is
*NL*
established
beyond
dispute
,
so
that
all
men
would
agree
at
once
to
worship
*NL*
it
.
For
these
pitiful
creatures
are
concerned
not
only
to
find
what
one
or
*NL*
the
other
can
worship
,
but
to
find
something
that
all
would
believe
in
and
*NL*
worship
;
what
is
essential
is
that
all
may
be
_
together
_
in
it
.
This
*NL*
craving
for
_
community
_
of
worship
is
the
chief
misery
of
every
man
*NL*
individually
and
of
all
humanity
from
the
beginning
of
time
.
For
the
sake
*NL*
of
common
worship
they
've
slain
each
other
with
the
sword
.
They
have
set
*NL*
up
gods
and
challenged
one
another
,
``
Put
away
your
gods
and
come
and
*NL*
worship
ours
,
or
we
will
kill
you
and
your
gods
!
''
And
so
it
will
be
to
the
*NL*
end
of
the
world
,
even
when
gods
disappear
from
the
earth
;
they
will
fall
*NL*
down
before
idols
just
the
same
.
Thou
didst
know
,
Thou
couldst
not
but
*NL*
have
known
,
this
fundamental
secret
of
human
nature
,
but
Thou
didst
reject
*NL*
the
one
infallible
banner
which
was
offered
Thee
to
make
all
men
bow
down
*NL*
to
Thee
alone
--
the
banner
of
earthly
bread
;
and
Thou
hast
rejected
it
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
freedom
and
the
bread
of
Heaven
.
Behold
what
Thou
didst
*NL*
further
.
And
all
again
in
the
name
of
freedom
!
I
tell
Thee
that
man
is
*NL*
tormented
by
no
greater
anxiety
than
to
find
some
one
quickly
to
whom
he
*NL*
can
hand
over
that
gift
of
freedom
with
which
the
ill-fated
creature
is
*NL*
born
.
But
only
one
who
can
appease
their
conscience
can
take
over
their
*NL*
freedom
.
In
bread
there
was
offered
Thee
an
invincible
banner
;
give
bread
,
*NL*
and
man
will
worship
thee
,
for
nothing
is
more
certain
than
bread
.
But
if
*NL*
some
one
else
gains
possession
of
his
conscience
--
oh
!
then
he
will
cast
*NL*
away
Thy
bread
and
follow
after
him
who
has
ensnared
his
conscience
.
In
*NL*
that
Thou
wast
right
.
For
the
secret
of
man
's
being
is
not
only
to
live
*NL*
but
to
have
something
to
live
for
.
Without
a
stable
conception
of
the
*NL*
object
of
life
,
man
would
not
consent
to
go
on
living
,
and
would
rather
*NL*
destroy
himself
than
remain
on
earth
,
though
he
had
bread
in
abundance
.
*NL*
That
is
true
.
But
what
happened
?
Instead
of
taking
men
's
freedom
from
*NL*
them
,
Thou
didst
make
it
greater
than
ever
!
Didst
Thou
forget
that
man
*NL*
prefers
peace
,
and
even
death
,
to
freedom
of
choice
in
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
good
and
evil
?
Nothing
is
more
seductive
for
man
than
his
freedom
of
*NL*
conscience
,
but
nothing
is
a
greater
cause
of
suffering
.
And
behold
,
*NL*
instead
of
giving
a
firm
foundation
for
setting
the
conscience
of
man
at
*NL*
rest
for
ever
,
Thou
didst
choose
all
that
is
exceptional
,
vague
and
*NL*
enigmatic
;
Thou
didst
choose
what
was
utterly
beyond
the
strength
of
men
,
*NL*
acting
as
though
Thou
didst
not
love
them
at
all
--
Thou
who
didst
come
to
*NL*
give
Thy
life
for
them
!
Instead
of
taking
possession
of
men
's
freedom
,
*NL*
Thou
didst
increase
it
,
and
burdened
the
spiritual
kingdom
of
mankind
with
*NL*
its
sufferings
for
ever
.
Thou
didst
desire
man
's
free
love
,
that
he
should
*NL*
follow
Thee
freely
,
enticed
and
taken
captive
by
Thee
.
In
place
of
the
*NL*
rigid
ancient
law
,
man
must
hereafter
with
free
heart
decide
for
himself
*NL*
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil
,
having
only
Thy
image
before
him
as
his
*NL*
guide
.
But
didst
Thou
not
know
that
he
would
at
last
reject
even
Thy
image
*NL*
and
Thy
truth
,
if
he
is
weighed
down
with
the
fearful
burden
of
free
*NL*
choice
?
They
will
cry
aloud
at
last
that
the
truth
is
not
in
Thee
,
for
*NL*
they
could
not
have
been
left
in
greater
confusion
and
suffering
than
Thou
*NL*
hast
caused
,
laying
upon
them
so
many
cares
and
unanswerable
problems
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
So
that
,
in
truth
,
Thou
didst
Thyself
lay
the
foundation
for
the
*NL*
destruction
of
Thy
kingdom
,
and
no
one
is
more
to
blame
for
it
.
Yet
what
*NL*
was
offered
Thee
?
There
are
three
powers
,
three
powers
alone
,
able
to
*NL*
conquer
and
to
hold
captive
for
ever
the
conscience
of
these
impotent
*NL*
rebels
for
their
happiness
--
those
forces
are
miracle
,
mystery
and
*NL*
authority
.
Thou
hast
rejected
all
three
and
hast
set
the
example
for
doing
*NL*
so
.
When
the
wise
and
dread
spirit
set
Thee
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
*NL*
and
said
to
Thee
,
``
If
Thou
wouldst
know
whether
Thou
art
the
Son
of
God
*NL*
then
cast
Thyself
down
,
for
it
is
written
:
the
angels
shall
hold
him
up
*NL*
lest
he
fall
and
bruise
himself
,
and
Thou
shalt
know
then
whether
Thou
art
*NL*
the
Son
of
God
and
shalt
prove
then
how
great
is
Thy
faith
in
Thy
Father
.
''
*NL*
But
Thou
didst
refuse
and
wouldst
not
cast
Thyself
down
.
Oh
,
of
course
,
*NL*
Thou
didst
proudly
and
well
,
like
God
;
but
the
weak
,
unruly
race
of
men
,
*NL*
are
they
gods
?
Oh
,
Thou
didst
know
then
that
in
taking
one
step
,
in
making
*NL*
one
movement
to
cast
Thyself
down
,
Thou
wouldst
be
tempting
God
and
have
*NL*
lost
all
Thy
faith
in
Him
,
and
wouldst
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
against
*NL*
that
earth
which
Thou
didst
come
to
save
.
And
the
wise
spirit
that
tempted
*NL*
Thee
would
have
rejoiced
.
But
I
ask
again
,
are
there
many
like
Thee
?
And
*NL*
couldst
Thou
believe
for
one
moment
that
men
,
too
,
could
face
such
a
*NL*
temptation
?
Is
the
nature
of
men
such
,
that
they
can
reject
miracle
,
and
*NL*
at
the
great
moments
of
their
life
,
the
moments
of
their
deepest
,
most
*NL*
agonizing
spiritual
difficulties
,
cling
only
to
the
free
verdict
of
the
*NL*
heart
?
Oh
,
Thou
didst
know
that
Thy
deed
would
be
recorded
in
books
,
would
*NL*
be
handed
down
to
remote
times
and
the
utmost
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
Thou
*NL*
didst
hope
that
man
,
following
Thee
,
would
cling
to
God
and
not
ask
for
a
*NL*
miracle
.
But
Thou
didst
not
know
that
when
man
rejects
miracle
he
rejects
*NL*
God
too
;
for
man
seeks
not
so
much
God
as
the
miraculous
.
And
as
man
*NL*
can
not
bear
to
be
without
the
miraculous
,
he
will
create
new
miracles
of
*NL*
his
own
for
himself
,
and
will
worship
deeds
of
sorcery
and
witchcraft
,
*NL*
though
he
might
be
a
hundred
times
over
a
rebel
,
heretic
and
infidel
.
Thou
*NL*
didst
not
come
down
from
the
Cross
when
they
shouted
to
Thee
,
mocking
and
*NL*
reviling
Thee
,
``
Come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
that
Thou
art
*NL*
He
.
''
Thou
didst
not
come
down
,
for
again
Thou
wouldst
not
enslave
man
by
a
*NL*
miracle
,
and
didst
crave
faith
given
freely
,
not
based
on
miracle
.
Thou
*NL*
didst
crave
for
free
love
and
not
the
base
raptures
of
the
slave
before
*NL*
the
might
that
has
overawed
him
for
ever
.
But
Thou
didst
think
too
highly
*NL*
of
men
therein
,
for
they
are
slaves
,
of
course
,
though
rebellious
by
*NL*
nature
.
Look
round
and
judge
;
fifteen
centuries
have
passed
,
look
upon
*NL*
them
.
Whom
hast
Thou
raised
up
to
Thyself
?
I
swear
,
man
is
weaker
and
*NL*
baser
by
nature
than
Thou
hast
believed
him
!
Can
he
,
can
he
do
what
Thou
*NL*
didst
?
By
showing
him
so
much
respect
,
Thou
didst
,
as
it
were
,
cease
to
*NL*
feel
for
him
,
for
Thou
didst
ask
far
too
much
from
him
--
Thou
who
hast
loved
*NL*
him
more
than
Thyself
!
Respecting
him
less
,
Thou
wouldst
have
asked
less
*NL*
of
him
.
That
would
have
been
more
like
love
,
for
his
burden
would
have
*NL*
been
lighter
.
He
is
weak
and
vile
.
What
though
he
is
everywhere
now
*NL*
rebelling
against
our
power
,
and
proud
of
his
rebellion
?
It
is
the
pride
*NL*
of
a
child
and
a
schoolboy
.
They
are
little
children
rioting
and
barring
*NL*
out
the
teacher
at
school
.
But
their
childish
delight
will
end
;
it
will
*NL*
cost
them
dear
.
They
will
cast
down
temples
and
drench
the
earth
with
*NL*
blood
.
But
they
will
see
at
last
,
the
foolish
children
,
that
,
though
they
*NL*
are
rebels
,
they
are
impotent
rebels
,
unable
to
keep
up
their
own
*NL*
rebellion
.
Bathed
in
their
foolish
tears
,
they
will
recognize
at
last
that
*NL*
He
who
created
them
rebels
must
have
meant
to
mock
at
them
.
They
will
say
*NL*
this
in
despair
,
and
their
utterance
will
be
a
blasphemy
which
will
make
*NL*
them
more
unhappy
still
,
for
man
's
nature
can
not
bear
blasphemy
,
and
in
*NL*
the
end
always
avenges
it
on
itself
.
And
so
unrest
,
confusion
and
*NL*
unhappiness
--
that
is
the
present
lot
of
man
after
Thou
didst
bear
so
much
*NL*
for
their
freedom
!
The
great
prophet
tells
in
vision
and
in
image
,
that
he
*NL*
saw
all
those
who
took
part
in
the
first
resurrection
and
that
there
were
*NL*
of
each
tribe
twelve
thousand
.
But
if
there
were
so
many
of
them
,
they
*NL*
must
have
been
not
men
but
gods
.
They
had
borne
Thy
cross
,
they
had
*NL*
endured
scores
of
years
in
the
barren
,
hungry
wilderness
,
living
upon
*NL*
locusts
and
roots
--
and
Thou
mayest
indeed
point
with
pride
at
those
*NL*
children
of
freedom
,
of
free
love
,
of
free
and
splendid
sacrifice
for
Thy
*NL*
name
.
But
remember
that
they
were
only
some
thousands
;
and
what
of
the
*NL*
rest
?
And
how
are
the
other
weak
ones
to
blame
,
because
they
could
not
*NL*
endure
what
the
strong
have
endured
?
How
is
the
weak
soul
to
blame
that
it
*NL*
is
unable
to
receive
such
terrible
gifts
?
Canst
Thou
have
simply
come
to
*NL*
the
elect
and
for
the
elect
?
But
if
so
,
it
is
a
mystery
and
we
can
not
*NL*
understand
it
.
And
if
it
is
a
mystery
,
we
too
have
a
right
to
preach
a
*NL*
mystery
,
and
to
teach
them
that
it
's
not
the
free
judgment
of
their
*NL*
hearts
,
not
love
that
matters
,
but
a
mystery
which
they
must
follow
*NL*
blindly
,
even
against
their
conscience
.
So
we
have
done
.
We
have
corrected
*NL*
Thy
work
and
have
founded
it
upon
_
miracle
_
,
_
mystery
_
and
_
authority
_
.
*NL*
And
men
rejoiced
that
they
were
again
led
like
sheep
,
and
that
the
*NL*
terrible
gift
that
had
brought
them
such
suffering
was
,
at
last
,
lifted
*NL*
from
their
hearts
.
Were
we
right
teaching
them
this
?
Speak
!
Did
we
not
*NL*
love
mankind
,
so
meekly
acknowledging
their
feebleness
,
lovingly
*NL*
lightening
their
burden
,
and
permitting
their
weak
nature
even
sin
with
*NL*
our
sanction
?
Why
hast
Thou
come
now
to
hinder
us
?
And
why
dost
Thou
look
*NL*
silently
and
searchingly
at
me
with
Thy
mild
eyes
?
Be
angry
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
Thy
love
,
for
I
love
Thee
not
.
And
what
use
is
it
for
me
to
hide
anything
*NL*
from
Thee
?
Do
n't
I
know
to
Whom
I
am
speaking
?
All
that
I
can
say
is
known
*NL*
to
Thee
already
.
And
is
it
for
me
to
conceal
from
Thee
our
mystery
?
*NL*
Perhaps
it
is
Thy
will
to
hear
it
from
my
lips
.
Listen
,
then
.
We
are
not
*NL*
working
with
Thee
,
but
with
_
him
_
--
that
is
our
mystery
.
It
's
long
--
eight
*NL*
centuries
--
since
we
have
been
on
_
his
_
side
and
not
on
Thine
.
Just
eight
*NL*
centuries
ago
,
we
took
from
him
what
Thou
didst
reject
with
scorn
,
that
*NL*
last
gift
he
offered
Thee
,
showing
Thee
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
.
We
*NL*
took
from
him
Rome
and
the
sword
of
Caesar
,
and
proclaimed
ourselves
sole
*NL*
rulers
of
the
earth
,
though
hitherto
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete
our
*NL*
work
.
But
whose
fault
is
that
?
Oh
,
the
work
is
only
beginning
,
but
it
has
*NL*
begun
.
It
has
long
to
await
completion
and
the
earth
has
yet
much
to
*NL*
suffer
,
but
we
shall
triumph
and
shall
be
Caesars
,
and
then
we
shall
plan
*NL*
the
universal
happiness
of
man
.
But
Thou
mightest
have
taken
even
then
the
*NL*
sword
of
Caesar
.
Why
didst
Thou
reject
that
last
gift
?
Hadst
Thou
accepted
*NL*
that
last
counsel
of
the
mighty
spirit
,
Thou
wouldst
have
accomplished
all
*NL*
that
man
seeks
on
earth
--
that
is
,
some
one
to
worship
,
some
one
to
keep
his
*NL*
conscience
,
and
some
means
of
uniting
all
in
one
unanimous
and
harmonious
*NL*
ant-heap
,
for
the
craving
for
universal
unity
is
the
third
and
last
*NL*
anguish
of
men
.
Mankind
as
a
whole
has
always
striven
to
organize
a
*NL*
universal
state
.
There
have
been
many
great
nations
with
great
histories
,
*NL*
but
the
more
highly
they
were
developed
the
more
unhappy
they
were
,
for
*NL*
they
felt
more
acutely
than
other
people
the
craving
for
world-wide
union
.
*NL*
The
great
conquerors
,
Timours
and
Ghenghis-Khans
,
whirled
like
hurricanes
*NL*
over
the
face
of
the
earth
striving
to
subdue
its
people
,
and
they
too
*NL*
were
but
the
unconscious
expression
of
the
same
craving
for
universal
*NL*
unity
.
Hadst
Thou
taken
the
world
and
Caesar
's
purple
,
Thou
wouldst
have
*NL*
founded
the
universal
state
and
have
given
universal
peace
.
For
who
can
*NL*
rule
men
if
not
he
who
holds
their
conscience
and
their
bread
in
his
*NL*
hands
?
We
have
taken
the
sword
of
Caesar
,
and
in
taking
it
,
of
course
,
have
*NL*
rejected
Thee
and
followed
_
him
_
.
Oh
,
ages
are
yet
to
come
of
the
*NL*
confusion
of
free
thought
,
of
their
science
and
cannibalism
.
For
having
*NL*
begun
to
build
their
tower
of
Babel
without
us
,
they
will
end
,
of
course
,
*NL*
with
cannibalism
.
But
then
the
beast
will
crawl
to
us
and
lick
our
feet
*NL*
and
spatter
them
with
tears
of
blood
.
And
we
shall
sit
upon
the
beast
and
*NL*
raise
the
cup
,
and
on
it
will
be
written
,
``
Mystery
.
''
But
then
,
and
only
*NL*
then
,
the
reign
of
peace
and
happiness
will
come
for
men
.
Thou
art
proud
*NL*
of
Thine
elect
,
but
Thou
hast
only
the
elect
,
while
we
give
rest
to
all
.
*NL*
And
besides
,
how
many
of
those
elect
,
those
mighty
ones
who
could
become
*NL*
elect
,
have
grown
weary
waiting
for
Thee
,
and
have
transferred
and
will
*NL*
transfer
the
powers
of
their
spirit
and
the
warmth
of
their
heart
to
the
*NL*
other
camp
,
and
end
by
raising
their
_
free
_
banner
against
Thee
.
Thou
*NL*
didst
Thyself
lift
up
that
banner
.
But
with
us
all
will
be
happy
and
will
*NL*
no
more
rebel
nor
destroy
one
another
as
under
Thy
freedom
.
Oh
,
we
shall
*NL*
persuade
them
that
they
will
only
become
free
when
they
renounce
their
*NL*
freedom
to
us
and
submit
to
us
.
And
shall
we
be
right
or
shall
we
be
*NL*
lying
?
They
will
be
convinced
that
we
are
right
,
for
they
will
remember
*NL*
the
horrors
of
slavery
and
confusion
to
which
Thy
freedom
brought
them
.
*NL*
Freedom
,
free
thought
and
science
,
will
lead
them
into
such
straits
and
*NL*
will
bring
them
face
to
face
with
such
marvels
and
insoluble
mysteries
,
*NL*
that
some
of
them
,
the
fierce
and
rebellious
,
will
destroy
themselves
,
*NL*
others
,
rebellious
but
weak
,
will
destroy
one
another
,
while
the
rest
,
*NL*
weak
and
unhappy
,
will
crawl
fawning
to
our
feet
and
whine
to
us
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
you
were
right
,
you
alone
possess
His
mystery
,
and
we
come
back
to
you
,
*NL*
save
us
from
ourselves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Receiving
bread
from
us
,
they
will
see
clearly
that
we
take
the
bread
*NL*
made
by
their
hands
from
them
,
to
give
it
to
them
,
without
any
miracle
.
*NL*
They
will
see
that
we
do
not
change
the
stones
to
bread
,
but
in
truth
they
*NL*
will
be
more
thankful
for
taking
it
from
our
hands
than
for
the
bread
*NL*
itself
!
For
they
will
remember
only
too
well
that
in
old
days
,
without
our
*NL*
help
,
even
the
bread
they
made
turned
to
stones
in
their
hands
,
while
*NL*
since
they
have
come
back
to
us
,
the
very
stones
have
turned
to
bread
in
*NL*
their
hands
.
Too
,
too
well
will
they
know
the
value
of
complete
*NL*
submission
!
And
until
men
know
that
,
they
will
be
unhappy
.
Who
is
most
to
*NL*
blame
for
their
not
knowing
it
?
--
speak
!
Who
scattered
the
flock
and
sent
it
*NL*
astray
on
unknown
paths
?
But
the
flock
will
come
together
again
and
will
*NL*
submit
once
more
,
and
then
it
will
be
once
for
all
.
Then
we
shall
give
*NL*
them
the
quiet
humble
happiness
of
weak
creatures
such
as
they
are
by
*NL*
nature
.
Oh
,
we
shall
persuade
them
at
last
not
to
be
proud
,
for
Thou
didst
*NL*
lift
them
up
and
thereby
taught
them
to
be
proud
.
We
shall
show
them
that
*NL*
they
are
weak
,
that
they
are
only
pitiful
children
,
but
that
childlike
*NL*
happiness
is
the
sweetest
of
all
.
They
will
become
timid
and
will
look
to
*NL*
us
and
huddle
close
to
us
in
fear
,
as
chicks
to
the
hen
.
They
will
marvel
*NL*
at
us
and
will
be
awe-stricken
before
us
,
and
will
be
proud
at
our
being
*NL*
so
powerful
and
clever
,
that
we
have
been
able
to
subdue
such
a
turbulent
*NL*
flock
of
thousands
of
millions
.
They
will
tremble
impotently
before
our
*NL*
wrath
,
their
minds
will
grow
fearful
,
they
will
be
quick
to
shed
tears
*NL*
like
women
and
children
,
but
they
will
be
just
as
ready
at
a
sign
from
us
*NL*
to
pass
to
laughter
and
rejoicing
,
to
happy
mirth
and
childish
song
.
Yes
,
*NL*
we
shall
set
them
to
work
,
but
in
their
leisure
hours
we
shall
make
their
*NL*
life
like
a
child
's
game
,
with
children
's
songs
and
innocent
dance
.
Oh
,
we
*NL*
shall
allow
them
even
sin
,
they
are
weak
and
helpless
,
and
they
will
love
*NL*
us
like
children
because
we
allow
them
to
sin
.
We
shall
tell
them
that
*NL*
every
sin
will
be
expiated
,
if
it
is
done
with
our
permission
,
that
we
*NL*
allow
them
to
sin
because
we
love
them
,
and
the
punishment
for
these
sins
*NL*
we
take
upon
ourselves
.
And
we
shall
take
it
upon
ourselves
,
and
they
will
*NL*
adore
us
as
their
saviors
who
have
taken
on
themselves
their
sins
before
*NL*
God
.
And
they
will
have
no
secrets
from
us
.
We
shall
allow
or
forbid
them
*NL*
to
live
with
their
wives
and
mistresses
,
to
have
or
not
to
have
*NL*
children
--
according
to
whether
they
have
been
obedient
or
disobedient
--
and
*NL*
they
will
submit
to
us
gladly
and
cheerfully
.
The
most
painful
secrets
of
*NL*
their
conscience
,
all
,
all
they
will
bring
to
us
,
and
we
shall
have
an
*NL*
answer
for
all
.
And
they
will
be
glad
to
believe
our
answer
,
for
it
will
*NL*
save
them
from
the
great
anxiety
and
terrible
agony
they
endure
at
present
*NL*
in
making
a
free
decision
for
themselves
.
And
all
will
be
happy
,
all
the
*NL*
millions
of
creatures
except
the
hundred
thousand
who
rule
over
them
.
For
*NL*
only
we
,
we
who
guard
the
mystery
,
shall
be
unhappy
.
There
will
be
*NL*
thousands
of
millions
of
happy
babes
,
and
a
hundred
thousand
sufferers
who
*NL*
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
curse
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
.
*NL*
Peacefully
they
will
die
,
peacefully
they
will
expire
in
Thy
name
,
and
*NL*
beyond
the
grave
they
will
find
nothing
but
death
.
But
we
shall
keep
the
*NL*
secret
,
and
for
their
happiness
we
shall
allure
them
with
the
reward
of
*NL*
heaven
and
eternity
.
Though
if
there
were
anything
in
the
other
world
,
it
*NL*
certainly
would
not
be
for
such
as
they
.
It
is
prophesied
that
Thou
wilt
*NL*
come
again
in
victory
,
Thou
wilt
come
with
Thy
chosen
,
the
proud
and
*NL*
strong
,
but
we
will
say
that
they
have
only
saved
themselves
,
but
we
have
*NL*
saved
all
.
We
are
told
that
the
harlot
who
sits
upon
the
beast
,
and
holds
*NL*
in
her
hands
the
_
mystery
_
,
shall
be
put
to
shame
,
that
the
weak
will
rise
*NL*
up
again
,
and
will
rend
her
royal
purple
and
will
strip
naked
her
*NL*
loathsome
body
.
But
then
I
will
stand
up
and
point
out
to
Thee
the
*NL*
thousand
millions
of
happy
children
who
have
known
no
sin
.
And
we
who
have
*NL*
taken
their
sins
upon
us
for
their
happiness
will
stand
up
before
Thee
and
*NL*
say
:
``
Judge
us
if
Thou
canst
and
darest
.
''
Know
that
I
fear
Thee
not
.
Know
*NL*
that
I
too
have
been
in
the
wilderness
,
I
too
have
lived
on
roots
and
*NL*
locusts
,
I
too
prized
the
freedom
with
which
Thou
hast
blessed
men
,
and
I
*NL*
too
was
striving
to
stand
among
Thy
elect
,
among
the
strong
and
powerful
,
*NL*
thirsting
``
to
make
up
the
number
.
''
But
I
awakened
and
would
not
serve
*NL*
madness
.
I
turned
back
and
joined
the
ranks
of
those
_
who
have
corrected
*NL*
Thy
work
_
.
I
left
the
proud
and
went
back
to
the
humble
,
for
the
happiness
*NL*
of
the
humble
.
What
I
say
to
Thee
will
come
to
pass
,
and
our
dominion
will
*NL*
be
built
up
.
I
repeat
,
to-morrow
Thou
shalt
see
that
obedient
flock
who
at
*NL*
a
sign
from
me
will
hasten
to
heap
up
the
hot
cinders
about
the
pile
on
*NL*
which
I
shall
burn
Thee
for
coming
to
hinder
us
.
For
if
any
one
has
ever
*NL*
deserved
our
fires
,
it
is
Thou
.
To-morrow
I
shall
burn
Thee
.

Ivan
stopped

He
was
carried
away
as
he
talked
,
and
spoke
with
excitement
;
*NL*
when
he
had
finished
,
he
suddenly
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
had
listened
in
silence

towards
the

he
was
greatly
moved
and
*NL*
seemed
several
times
on
the
point
of
interrupting

restrained
himself

Now
his
words
came
with
a
rush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
...
that
's
absurd
!

he
cried
,
flushing
.

Your
poem
is
in
praise
of

And
who
will
believe
you
*NL*
about
freedom

Is
that
the
way
to
understand
it
?
That
's
not
the
idea
of
it
*NL*
in

Orthodox
Church
...
That
's
Rome

not

the

those
are

worst
of

the
*NL*
Jesuits
!
...
And
there
could
not
be
such
a
fantastic
creature
as
your
*NL*
Inquisitor
.
What
are
these
sins
of
mankind
they
take
on
themselves
?
Who
*NL*
are
these
keepers
of
the
mystery
who
have
taken
some
curse
upon
themselves
*NL*
for
the
happiness

mankind

When
have
they
been

We
know
the
*NL*
Jesuits
,
they
are
spoken
ill
of
,
but
surely
they
are
not
what
you
*NL*
describe
?
They
are
not
that
at
all
,
not
at
all

They
are
simply
the
*NL*
Romish
army
for
the
earthly
sovereignty
of
the
world
in
the
future
,
with
*NL*
the
Pontiff
of

for
Emperor

that
's
their
ideal
,
but
there
's
no
*NL*
sort
of
mystery

lofty
melancholy
about
it

It
's
simple
lust
of
*NL*
power

of
filthy
earthly
gain

of
domination
--
something
like
a
universal
*NL*
serfdom
with

that
's
all
they

They
do

do

but
of

*NL*
Alyosha
hastily
corrected
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
precious
admission
,
in
spite
of
your
`
not
a
bit
the

.
'
I
ask
you
*NL*
why
your
Jesuits
and
Inquisitors
have
united
simply
for
vile
material
*NL*
gain
?
Why
can
there
not
be
among
them
one
martyr
oppressed
by
great
sorrow
*NL*
and
loving
humanity
?
You
see
,
only
suppose
that
there
was
one
such
man
*NL*
among
all
those
who
desire
nothing
but
filthy
material
gain
--
if
there
's
*NL*
only
one
like
my
old
Inquisitor
,
who
had
himself
eaten
roots
in
the
desert
*NL*
and
made
frenzied
efforts
to
subdue
his
flesh
to
make
himself
free
and
*NL*
perfect
.
But
yet
all
his
life
he
loved
humanity
,
and
suddenly
his
eyes
*NL*
were
opened
,
and
he
saw
that
it
is
no
great
moral
blessedness
to
attain
*NL*
perfection
and
freedom
,
if
at
the
same
time
one
gains
the
conviction
that
*NL*
millions
of
God
's
creatures
have
been
created
as
a
mockery
,
that
they
will
*NL*
never
be
capable
of
using
their
freedom
,
that
these
poor
rebels
can
never
*NL*
turn
into
giants
to
complete
the
tower
,
that
it
was
not
for
such
geese
*NL*
that
the
great
idealist
dreamt
his
dream
of
harmony
.
Seeing
all
that
he
*NL*
turned
back
and
joined
--
the
clever
people
.
Surely
that
could
have
*NL*
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joined

clever

''
cried
Alyosha
,
completely
carried
away
.
*NL*
``
They
have
no
such
great
cleverness
and
no
mysteries
and
secrets
...
*NL*
Perhaps
nothing
but
Atheism
,
that
's
all
their
secret
.
Your
Inquisitor
does
*NL*
not
believe
in
God
,
that
's
his
secret
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
it
is
so
!
At
last
you
have
guessed
it
.
It
's
perfectly
true
,
it
's
*NL*
true
that
that
's
the
whole
secret
,
but
is
n't
that
suffering
,
at
least
for
*NL*
a
man
like
that
,
who
has
wasted
his
whole
life
in
the
desert
and
yet
could
*NL*
not
shake
off
his
incurable
love
of
humanity
?
In
his
old
age
he
reached
*NL*
the
clear
conviction
that
nothing
but
the
advice
of
the
great
dread
spirit
*NL*
could
build
up
any
tolerable
sort
of
life
for
the
feeble
,
unruly
,
*NL*
`
incomplete
,
empirical
creatures
created
in
jest
.
'
And
so
,
convinced
of
*NL*
this
,
he
sees
that
he
must
follow
the
counsel
of
the
wise
spirit
,
the
*NL*
dread
spirit
of
death
and
destruction
,
and
therefore
accept
lying
and
*NL*
deception
,
and
lead
men
consciously
to
death
and
destruction
,
and
yet
*NL*
deceive
them
all
the
way
so
that
they
may
not
notice
where
they
are
being
*NL*
led
,
that
the
poor
blind
creatures
may
at
least
on
the
way
think
*NL*
themselves
happy
.
And
note
,
the
deception
is
in
the
name
of
Him
in
Whose
*NL*
ideal
the
old
man
had
so
fervently
believed
all
his
life
long
.
Is
not
that
*NL*
tragic
?
And
if
only
one
such
stood
at
the
head
of
the
whole
army
`
filled
*NL*
with
the
lust
of
power
only
for
the
sake
of
filthy
gain
'
--
would
not
one
*NL*
such
be
enough
to
make
a
tragedy
?
More
than
that
,
one
such
standing
at
the
*NL*
head
is
enough
to
create
the
actual
leading
idea
of
the
Roman
Church
with
*NL*
all
its
armies
and
Jesuits
,
its
highest
idea
.
I
tell
you
frankly
that
I
*NL*
firmly
believe
that
there
has
always
been
such
a
man
among
those
who
stood
*NL*
at
the
head
of
the
movement
.
Who
knows
,
there
may
have
been
some
such
even
*NL*
among
the
Roman
Popes
.
Who
knows
,
perhaps
the
spirit
of
that
accursed
old
*NL*
man
who
loves
mankind
so
obstinately
in
his
own
way
,
is
to
be
found
even
*NL*
now
in
a
whole
multitude
of
such
old
men
,
existing
not
by
chance
but
by
*NL*
agreement
,
as
a
secret
league
formed
long
ago
for
the
guarding
of
the
*NL*
mystery
,
to
guard
it
from
the
weak
and
the
unhappy
,
so
as
to
make
them
*NL*
happy
.
No
doubt
it
is
so
,
and
so
it
must
be
indeed
.
I
fancy
that
even
*NL*
among
the
Masons
there
's
something
of
the
same
mystery
at
the
bottom
,
and
*NL*
that
that
's
why
the
Catholics
so
detest
the
Masons
as
their
rivals
*NL*
breaking
up
the
unity
of
the
idea
,
while
it
is
so
essential
that
there
*NL*
should
be
one
flock
and
one
shepherd
...
But
from
the
way
I
defend
my
idea
*NL*
I
might
be
an
author
impatient
of
your
criticism
.
Enough
of
it
.

suddenly
from

added
,
speaking
this
time
very
sorrowfully
.
He
*NL*
fancied
besides
that
his
brother
was
looking
at
him
ironically
.
``
How
does
*NL*
your
poem
end
?
''
he
asked
,
suddenly
looking
down
.
``
Or
was
it
the
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
end
it
like
this
.
When
the
Inquisitor
ceased
speaking
he
*NL*
waited
some
time
for
his
Prisoner
to
answer
him
.
His
silence
weighed
down
*NL*
upon
him
.
He
saw
that
the
Prisoner
had
listened
intently
all
the
time
,
*NL*
looking
gently
in
his
face
and
evidently
not
wishing
to
reply
.
The
old
man
*NL*
longed
for
Him
to
say
something
,
however
bitter
and
terrible
.
But
He
*NL*
suddenly
approached
the
old
man
in
silence
and
softly
kissed
him
on
his
*NL*
bloodless
aged
lips
.
That
was
all
His
answer
.
The
old
man
shuddered
.
His
*NL*
lips
moved
.
He
went
to
the
door
,
opened
it
,
and
said
to
Him
:
`
Go
,
and
come
*NL*
no
more
...
come
not
at
all
,
never
,
never
!
'
And
he
let
Him
out
into
the
*NL*
dark
alleys
of
the
town
.
The
Prisoner
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
old
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
kiss
glows
in
his
heart
,
but
the
old
man
adheres
to
his
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
with
him
,
you
too
?
''
cried
Alyosha
,
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
all
nonsense
,
Alyosha
.
It
's
only
a
senseless
poem
of
a
*NL*
senseless
student
,
who
could
never
write
two
lines
of
verse
.
Why
do
you
*NL*
take
it
so
seriously
?
Surely
you
do
n't
suppose
I
am
going
straight
off
to
*NL*
the
Jesuits
,
to
join
the
men
who
are
correcting
His
work
?
Good
Lord
,
it
's
*NL*
no
business
of
mine

I
told
you
,
all
I
want
is
to
live
on
to
thirty

*NL*
then

dash
the
cup
to
the
ground

little
sticky
leaves

precious
tombs

How
will
you
live

you

*NL*
Alyosha
cried
sorrowfully
.
``
With
such
a
hell
in
your

your
head

*NL*
how
can
you

No

just

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
strength
to
endure
everything

Ivan
said
with
a
cold
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
strength
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
strength
of

Karamazovs

To
sink

*NL*

Possibly
even
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

impossible

*NL*
``
In

*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
scowled
,
and
all
at
once
turned
strangely
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
've
caught
up

so
offended
Miuesov

naively

he
smiled
queerly
.
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
that
going
away
from
here
I
have
you
at

Ivan
said
*NL*
suddenly
,
with
unexpected
feeling
;
``
but
now
I
see
that
there
is
no

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
got
up
,
went
to
him
and
softly
kissed
him
on
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
plagiarism

cried
Ivan
,
highly
delighted
.
``
You
stole
that

Thank

Get
up

we
were
going

both

us

*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
,
but
stopped
when
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
restaurant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Alyosha

Ivan
began
in
a
resolute
voice
,
``
if
I
am
really
able
to
*NL*
care
for
the
sticky
little
leaves
I
shall
only
love
them

remembering
you

*NL*
It
's
enough
for
me
that
you
are
somewhere
here
,
and
I
sha
n't
lose
my
*NL*
desire
for
life
yet
.
Is
that
enough
for
you
?
Take
it
as
a
declaration
of
*NL*
love
if
you
like
.
And
now
you
go
to
the
right
and
I
to
the
left

it
's
*NL*
enough
,
do
you
hear
,
enough

I
mean
even
if
I
do
n't
go
away
to-morrow
-LRB-
I
*NL*
think
I
certainly
shall
go
-RRB-
and
we
meet
again
,
do
n't
say
a
word
more
on
*NL*
these
subjects

I
beg
that
particularly

And
about
Dmitri
too

I
ask
you
*NL*
specially

never
speak

me

he
added
,
with
sudden
irritation
;
*NL*
``

's
all
exhausted

it
has
all
been
said
over
and
over
again

has
n't
it

And
I
'll
make
you
one
promise
in
return
for
it

When
at
thirty
,
I
want
to
*NL*
`
dash
the
cup
to
the
ground

wherever
I
may
be
I
'll
come
to
have
one
more
*NL*
talk
with
you

even
though
it
were
from
America
,
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
*NL*
I
'll
come
on
purpose
.
It
will
be
very
interesting
to
have
a
look
at
you
,
*NL*
to
see
what
you
'll
be
by
that
time
.
It
's
rather
a
solemn
promise
,
you
see
.
*NL*
And
we
really
may
be
parting
for
seven
years
or
ten
.
Come
,
go
now
to
your
*NL*
Pater
Seraphicus
,
he
is
dying

If
he
dies
without
you
,
you
will
be
angry
*NL*
with
me
for
having
kept
you

Good-by

kiss
me
once
more
;
that
's
right
,
now
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
turned
suddenly
and
went
his
way
without
looking
back
.
It
was
just
as
*NL*
Dmitri
had
left
Alyosha
the
day
before
,
though
the
parting
had
been
very
*NL*
different
.
The
strange
resemblance
flashed
like
an
arrow
through
Alyosha
's
*NL*
mind
in
the
distress
and
dejection
of
that
moment
.
He
waited
a
little
,
*NL*
looking
after
his
brother
.
He
suddenly
noticed
that
Ivan
swayed
as
he
*NL*
walked
and
that
his
right
shoulder
looked
lower
than
his
left
.
He
had
*NL*
never
noticed
it
before
.
But
all
at
once
he
turned
too
,
and
almost
ran
to
*NL*
the
monastery
.
It
was
nearly
dark
,
and
he
felt
almost
frightened
;
*NL*
something
new
was
growing
up
in
him
for
which
he
could
not
account
.
The
*NL*
wind
had
risen
again
as
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
the
ancient
pines
*NL*
murmured
gloomily
about
him
when
he
entered
the
hermitage
copse
.
He
almost
*NL*
ran
.
``
Pater
Seraphicus
--
he
got
that
name
from
somewhere
--
where
from
?
''
*NL*
Alyosha
wondered
.
``
Ivan
,
poor
Ivan
,
and
when
shall
I
see
you
again
?
...
*NL*
Here
is
the
hermitage
.
Yes
,
yes
,
that
he
is
,
Pater
Seraphicus
,
he
will
*NL*
save
me
--
from
him
and
for
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
afterwards
he
wondered
how
he
could
on
leaving
Ivan
so
*NL*
completely
forget
his
brother
Dmitri
,
though
he
had
that
morning
,
only
a
*NL*
few
hours
before
,
so
firmly
resolved
to
find
him
and
not
to
give
up
doing
*NL*
so
,
even
should
he
be
unable
to
return
to
the
monastery
that
night
.

Chapter
VI
.
For
Awhile
A
Very
Obscure
One
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
Ivan
,
on
parting
from
Alyosha
,
went
home
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
house
.
*NL*
But
,
strange
to
say
,
he
was
overcome
by
insufferable
depression
,
which
*NL*
grew
greater
at
every
step
he
took
towards
the
house
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
strange
in
his
being
depressed
;
what
was
strange
was
that
Ivan
could
not
*NL*
have
said
what
was
the
cause
of
it
.
He
had
often
been
depressed
before
,
*NL*
and
there
was
nothing
surprising
at
his
feeling
so
at
such
a
moment
,
when
*NL*
he
had
broken
off
with
everything
that
had
brought
him
here
,
and
was
*NL*
preparing
that
day
to
make
a
new
start
and
enter
upon
a
new
,
unknown
*NL*
future
.
He
would
again
be
as
solitary
as
ever
,
and
though
he
had
great
*NL*
hopes
,
and
great
--
too
great
--
expectations
from
life
,
he
could
not
have
given
*NL*
any
definite
account
of
his
hopes
,
his
expectations
,
or
even
his
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
at
that
moment
,
though
the
apprehension
of
the
new
and
unknown
*NL*
certainly
found
place
in
his
heart
,
what
was
worrying
him
was
something
*NL*
quite
different
.
``
Is
it
loathing
for
my
father
's
house
?
''
he
wondered
.
*NL*
``
Quite
likely
;
I
am
so
sick
of
it
;
and
though
it
's
the
last
time
I
shall
*NL*
cross
its
hateful
threshold
,
still
I
loathe
it
...
No
,
it
's
not
that
*NL*
either
.
Is
it
the
parting
with
Alyosha
and
the
conversation
I
had
with
*NL*
him
?
For
so
many
years
I
've
been
silent
with
the
whole
world
and
not
*NL*
deigned
to
speak
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
reel
off
a
rigmarole
like
that
.
''
*NL*
It
certainly
might
have
been
the
youthful
vexation
of
youthful
*NL*
inexperience
and
vanity
--
vexation
at
having
failed
to
express
himself
,
*NL*
especially
with
such
a
being
as
Alyosha
,
on
whom
his
heart
had
certainly
*NL*
been
reckoning
.
No
doubt
that
came
in
,
that
vexation
,
it
must
have
done
*NL*
indeed
;
but
yet
that
was
not
it
,
that
was
not
it
either
.
``
I
feel
sick
with
*NL*
depression
and
yet
I
ca
n't
tell
what
I
want
.
Better
not
think
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
tried
``
not
to
think
,
''
but
that
,
too
,
was
no
use
.
What
made
his
*NL*
depression
so
vexatious
and
irritating
was
that
it
had
a
kind
of
casual
,
*NL*
external
character
--
he
felt
that
.
Some
person
or
thing
seemed
to
be
*NL*
standing
out
somewhere
,
just
as
something
will
sometimes
obtrude
itself
*NL*
upon
the
eye
,
and
though
one
may
be
so
busy
with
work
or
conversation
that
*NL*
for
a
long
time
one
does
not
notice
it
,
yet
it
irritates
and
almost
*NL*
torments
one
till
at
last
one
realizes
,
and
removes
the
offending
object
,
*NL*
often
quite
a
trifling
and
ridiculous
one
--
some
article
left
about
in
the
*NL*
wrong
place
,
a
handkerchief
on
the
floor
,
a
book
not
replaced
on
the
*NL*
shelf
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
feeling
very
cross
and
ill-humored
,
Ivan
arrived
home
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
,
about
fifteen
paces
from
the
garden
gate
,
he
guessed
what
was
*NL*
fretting
and
worrying
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
bench
in
the
gateway
the
valet
Smerdyakov
was
sitting
enjoying
the
*NL*
coolness
of
the
evening
,
and
at
the
first
glance
at
him
Ivan
knew
that
the
*NL*
valet
Smerdyakov
was
on
his
mind
,
and
that
it
was
this
man
that
his
soul
*NL*
loathed
.
It
all
dawned
upon
him
suddenly
and
became
clear
.
Just
before
,
*NL*
when
Alyosha
had
been
telling
him
of
his
meeting
with
Smerdyakov
,
he
had
*NL*
felt
a
sudden
twinge
of
gloom
and
loathing
,
which
had
immediately
stirred
*NL*
responsive
anger
in
his
heart
.
Afterwards
,
as
he
talked
,
Smerdyakov
had
*NL*
been
forgotten
for
the
time
;
but
still
he
had
been
in
his
mind
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
Ivan
parted
with
Alyosha
and
was
walking
home
,
the
forgotten
*NL*
sensation
began
to
obtrude
itself
again
.
``
Is
it
possible
that
a
miserable
,
*NL*
contemptible
creature
like
that
can
worry
me
so
much
?
''
he
wondered
,
with
*NL*
insufferable
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
Ivan
had
come
of
late
to
feel
an
intense
dislike
for
the
*NL*
man
,
especially
during
the
last
few
days
.
He
had
even
begun
to
notice
in
*NL*
himself
a
growing
feeling
that
was
almost
of
hatred
for
the
creature
.
*NL*
Perhaps
this
hatred
was
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
when
Ivan
first
came
*NL*
to
the
neighborhood
he
had
felt
quite
differently
.
Then
he
had
taken
a
*NL*
marked
interest
in
Smerdyakov
,
and
had
even
thought
him
very
original
.
He
*NL*
had
encouraged
him
to
talk
to
him
,
although
he
had
always
wondered
at
a
*NL*
certain
incoherence
,
or
rather
restlessness
,
in
his
mind
,
and
could
not
*NL*
understand
what
it
was
that
so
continually
and
insistently
worked
upon
the
*NL*
brain
of
``
the
contemplative
.
''
They
discussed
philosophical
questions
and
*NL*
even
how
there
could
have
been
light
on
the
first
day
when
the
sun
,
moon
,
*NL*
and
stars
were
only
created
on
the
fourth
day
,
and
how
that
was
to
be
*NL*
understood
.
But
Ivan
soon
saw
that
,
though
the
sun
,
moon
,
and
stars
might
*NL*
be
an
interesting
subject
,
yet
that
it
was
quite
secondary
to
Smerdyakov
,
*NL*
and
that
he
was
looking
for
something
altogether
different
.
In
one
way
and
*NL*
another
,
he
began
to
betray
a
boundless
vanity
,
and
a
wounded
vanity
,
too
,
*NL*
and
that
Ivan
disliked
.
It
had
first
given
rise
to
his
aversion
.
Later
on
,
*NL*
there
had
been
trouble
in
the
house
.
Grushenka
had
come
on
the
scene
,
and
*NL*
there
had
been
the
scandals
with
his
brother
Dmitri
--
they
discussed
that
,
*NL*
too
.
But
though
Smerdyakov
always
talked
of
that
with
great
excitement
,
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
discover
what
he
desired
to
come
of
it
.
There
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
something
surprising
in
the
illogicality
and
incoherence
of
some
of
*NL*
his
desires
,
accidentally
betrayed
and
always
vaguely
expressed
.
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
always
inquiring
,
putting
certain
indirect
but
obviously
*NL*
premeditated
questions
,
but
what
his
object
was
he
did
not
explain
,
and
*NL*
usually
at
the
most
important
moment
he
would
break
off
and
relapse
into
*NL*
silence
or
pass
to
another
subject
.
But
what
finally
irritated
Ivan
most
*NL*
and
confirmed
his
dislike
for
him
was
the
peculiar
,
revolting
familiarity
*NL*
which
Smerdyakov
began
to
show
more
and
more
markedly
.
Not
that
he
forgot
*NL*
himself
and
was
rude
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
always
spoke
very
respectfully
,
*NL*
yet
he
had
obviously
begun
to
consider
--
goodness
knows
why
!
--
that
there
was
*NL*
some
sort
of
understanding
between
him
and
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
.
He
always
*NL*
spoke
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
those
two
had
some
kind
of
compact
,
*NL*
some
secret
between
them
,
that
had
at
some
time
been
expressed
on
both
*NL*
sides
,
only
known
to
them
and
beyond
the
comprehension
of
those
around
*NL*
them
.
But
for
a
long
while
Ivan
did
not
recognize
the
real
cause
of
his
*NL*
growing
dislike
and
he
had
only
lately
realized
what
was
at
the
root
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
irritation
he
tried
to
pass
in
at
the
gate
*NL*
without
speaking
or
looking
at
Smerdyakov
.
But
Smerdyakov
rose
from
the
*NL*
bench
,
and
from
that
action
alone
,
Ivan
knew
instantly
that
he
wanted
*NL*
particularly
to
talk
to
him
.
Ivan
looked
at
him
and
stopped
,
and
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
did
stop
,
instead
of
passing
by
,
as
he
meant
to
the
minute
before
,
*NL*
drove
him
to
fury
.
With
anger
and
repulsion
he
looked
at
Smerdyakov
's
*NL*
emasculate
,
sickly
face
,
with
the
little
curls
combed
forward
on
his
*NL*
forehead
.
His
left
eye
winked
and
he
grinned
as
if
to
say
,
``
Where
are
you
*NL*
going
?
You
wo
n't
pass
by
;
you
see
that
we
two
clever
people
have
something
*NL*
to
say
to
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
shook
.
``
Get
away
,
miserable
idiot
.
What
have
I
to
do
with
you
?
''
was
*NL*
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
,
but
to
his
profound
astonishment
he
heard
*NL*
himself
say
,
``
Is
my
father
still
asleep
,
or
has
he
waked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
the
question
softly
and
meekly
,
to
his
own
surprise
,
and
at
once
,
*NL*
again
to
his
own
surprise
,
sat
down
on
the
bench
.
For
an
instant
he
felt
*NL*
almost
frightened
;
he
remembered
it
afterwards
.
Smerdyakov
stood
facing
*NL*
him
,
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
looking
at
him
with
assurance
and
almost
*NL*
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
honor
is
still
asleep
,
''
he
articulated
deliberately
-LRB-
``
You
were
the
*NL*
first
to
speak
,
not
I
,
''
he
seemed
to
say
-RRB-
.
``
I
am
surprised
at
you
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
after
a
pause
,
dropping
his
eyes
affectedly
,
setting
his
right
*NL*
foot
forward
,
and
playing
with
the
tip
of
his
polished
boot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
surprised
at
me
?
''
Ivan
asked
abruptly
and
sullenly
,
doing
his
*NL*
utmost
to
restrain
himself
,
and
suddenly
realizing
,
with
disgust
,
that
he
*NL*
was
feeling
intense
curiosity
and
would
not
,
on
any
account
,
have
gone
*NL*
away
without
satisfying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
to
Tchermashnya
,
sir
?
''
Smerdyakov
suddenly
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
and
smiled
familiarly
.
``
Why
I
smile
you
must
understand
of
yourself
,
*NL*
if
you
are
a
clever
man
,
''
his
screwed-up
left
eye
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
go
to
Tchermashnya
?
''
Ivan
asked
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
himself
has
so
begged
you
to
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
slowly
*NL*
and
apparently
attaching
no
significance
to
his
answer
.
``
I
put
you
off
*NL*
with
a
secondary
reason
,
''
he
seemed
to
suggest
,
``
simply
to
say
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
you
!
Speak
out
what
you
want
!
''
Ivan
cried
angrily
at
last
,
passing
*NL*
from
meekness
to
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
drew
his
right
foot
up
to
his
left
,
pulled
himself
up
,
but
*NL*
still
looked
at
him
with
the
same
serenity
and
the
same
little
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Substantially
nothing
--
but
just
by
way
of
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
silence
followed
.
They
did
not
speak
for
nearly
a
minute
.
Ivan
*NL*
knew
that
he
ought
to
get
up
and
show
anger
,
and
Smerdyakov
stood
before
*NL*
him
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
as
though
to
see
whether
he
would
be
angry
or
*NL*
not
.
So
at
least
it
seemed
to
Ivan
.
At
last
he
moved
to
get
up
.
Smerdyakov
*NL*
seemed
to
seize
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
in
an
awful
position
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
help
*NL*
myself
,
''
he
said
resolutely
and
distinctly
,
and
at
his
last
word
he
*NL*
sighed
.
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
both
utterly
crazy
,
they
are
no
better
than
little
children
,
''
*NL*
Smerdyakov
went
on
.
``
I
am
speaking
of
your
parent
and
your
brother
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
.
Here
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
will
get
up
directly
and
begin
*NL*
worrying
me
every
minute
,
`
Has
she
come
?
Why
has
n't
she
come
?
'
and
so
on
*NL*
up
till
midnight
and
even
after
midnight
.
And
if
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
*NL*
does
n't
come
-LRB-
for
very
likely
she
does
not
mean
to
come
at
all
-RRB-
then
he
*NL*
will
be
at
me
again
to-morrow
morning
,
`
Why
has
n't
she
come
?
When
will
she
*NL*
come
?
'
--
as
though
I
were
to
blame
for
it
.
On
the
other
side
it
's
no
better
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
it
gets
dark
,
or
even
before
,
your
brother
will
appear
with
his
*NL*
gun
in
his
hands
:
`
Look
out
,
you
rogue
,
you
soup-maker
.
If
you
miss
her
*NL*
and
do
n't
let
me
know
she
's
been
--
I
'll
kill
you
before
any
one
.
'
When
the
*NL*
night
's
over
,
in
the
morning
,
he
,
too
,
like
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
begins
*NL*
worrying
me
to
death
.
`
Why
has
n't
she
come
?
Will
she
come
soon
?
'
And
he
,
*NL*
too
,
thinks
me
to
blame
because
his
lady
has
n't
come
.
And
every
day
and
*NL*
every
hour
they
get
angrier
and
angrier
,
so
that
I
sometimes
think
I
shall
*NL*
kill
myself
in
a
fright
.
I
ca
n't
depend
upon
them
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
have
you
meddled
?
Why
did
you
begin
to
spy
for
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
?
''
said
Ivan
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
help
meddling
?
Though
,
indeed
,
I
have
n't
meddled
at
all
,
if
*NL*
you
want
to
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
.
I
kept
quiet
from
the
very
*NL*
beginning
,
not
daring
to
answer
;
but
he
pitched
on
me
to
be
his
servant
.
*NL*
He
has
had
only
one
thing
to
say
since
:
`
I
'll
kill
you
,
you
scoundrel
,
if
*NL*
you
miss
her
,
'
I
feel
certain
,
sir
,
that
I
shall
have
a
long
fit
to
-
*NL*
morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
'
a
long
fit
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
long
fit
,
lasting
a
long
time
--
several
hours
,
or
perhaps
a
day
or
two
.
*NL*
Once
it
went
on
for
three
days
.
I
fell
from
the
garret
that
time
.
The
*NL*
struggling
ceased
and
then
began
again
,
and
for
three
days
I
could
n't
come
*NL*
back
to
my
senses
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
sent
for
Herzenstube
,
the
doctor
*NL*
here
,
and
he
put
ice
on
my
head
and
tried
another
remedy
,
too
...
I
might
*NL*
have
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
say
one
ca
n't
tell
with
epilepsy
when
a
fit
is
coming
.
What
*NL*
makes
you
say
you
will
have
one
to-morrow
?
''
Ivan
inquired
,
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
,
irritable
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
so
.
You
ca
n't
tell
beforehand

*NL*
*NL*

Besides
,
you
fell
from
the
garret
then

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
climb
up
to
the
garret
every
day

I
might
fall
from
the
garret
again
*NL*
to-morrow

And
,
if
not
,
I
might
fall
down
the
cellar
steps

I
have
to
go
*NL*
into
the
cellar
every
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
took
a
long
look
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
talking
nonsense
,
I
see
,
and
I
do
n't
quite
understand
you

he
*NL*
said
softly
,
but
with
a
sort
of
menace
.
``
Do
you
mean
to
pretend
to
be
ill
*NL*
to-morrow
for
three
days
,
eh

''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
who
was
looking
at
the
ground
again
,
and
playing
with
the
toe
*NL*
of
his
right
foot
,
set
the
foot
down
,
moved
the
left
one
forward
,
and
,
*NL*
grinning
,
articulated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
able
to
play
such
a
trick

have

*NL*
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
a
man
accustomed
to
them

I
should
have
a
*NL*
perfect
right
to
use
such
a
means
to
save
myself
from
death

For
even
if
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
comes
to
see
his
father
while
I
am
ill
,
his
honor
*NL*
ca
n't
blame
a
sick
man
for
not
telling
him
.
He
'd
be
ashamed
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
it
all
!

Ivan
cried
,
his
face
working
with
anger
,
``
why
are
you
*NL*
always
in
such
a
funk
for
your
life

All
my

only
hasty

*NL*
*NL*
``

even
more
than
that

afraid
I
shall
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
of
his
when
he
does
something
*NL*
crazy
to
his
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
think
I
am
an
accomplice

because
I
let
him
know
the
signals

a
*NL*
great
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
signals
?
Whom
did
you
tell
?
Confound
you
,
speak
more
plainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
bound
to
admit
the
fact
,
''
Smerdyakov
drawled
with
pedantic
composure
,
*NL*
``
that
I
have
a
secret
with
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
in
this
business
.
As
you
know
*NL*
yourself
-LRB-
if
only
you
do
know
it
-RRB-
he
has
for
several
days
past
locked
*NL*
himself
in
as
soon
as
night
or
even
evening
comes
on
.
Of
late
you
've
been
*NL*
going
upstairs
to
your
room
early
every
evening
,
and
yesterday
you
did
not
*NL*
come
down
at
all
,
and
so
perhaps
you
do
n't
know
how
carefully
he
has
begun
*NL*
to
lock
himself
in
at
night
,
and
even
if
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
comes
to
*NL*
the
door
he
wo
n't
open
to
him
till
he
hears
his
voice
.
But
Grigory
*NL*
Vassilyevitch
does
not
come
,
because
I
wait
upon
him
alone
in
his
room
*NL*
now
.
That
's
the
arrangement
he
made
himself
ever
since
this
to-do
with
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
began
.
But
at
night
,
by
his
orders
,
I
go
away
to
the
*NL*
lodge
so
that
I
do
n't
get
to
sleep
till
midnight
,
but
am
on
the
watch
,
*NL*
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
yard
,
waiting
for
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
*NL*
to
come
.
For
the
last
few
days
he
's
been
perfectly
frantic
expecting
her
.
*NL*
What
he
argues
is
,
she
is
afraid
of
him
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
-LRB-
Mitya
,
as
he
*NL*
calls
him
-RRB-
,
`
and
so
,
'
says
he
,
`
she
'll
come
the
back-way
,
late
at
night
,
*NL*
to
me
.
You
look
out
for
her
,
'
says
he
,
'till
midnight
and
later
;
and
if
*NL*
she
does
come
,
you
run
up
and
knock
at
my
door
or
at
the
window
from
the
*NL*
garden
.
Knock
at
first
twice
,
rather
gently
,
and
then
three
times
more
*NL*
quickly
,
then
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
shall
understand
at
once
that
she
has
come
,
*NL*
and
will
open
the
door
to
you
quietly
.
'
Another
signal
he
gave
me
in
case
*NL*
anything
unexpected
happens
.
At
first
,
two
knocks
,
and
then
,
after
an
*NL*
interval
,
another
much
louder
.
Then
he
will
understand
that
something
has
*NL*
happened
suddenly
and
that
I
must
see
him
,
and
he
will
open
to
me
so
that
*NL*
I
can
go
and
speak
to
him
.
That
's
all
in
case
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
ca
n't
*NL*
come
herself
,
but
sends
a
message
.
Besides
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
might
*NL*
come
,
too
,
so
I
must
let
him
know
he
is
near
.
His
honor
is
awfully
afraid
*NL*
of
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
so
that
even
if
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
had
come
and
*NL*
were
locked
in
with
him
,
and
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
were
to
turn
up
anywhere
*NL*
near
at
the
time
,
I
should
be
bound
to
let
him
know
at
once
,
knocking
*NL*
three
times
.
So
that
the
first
signal
of
five
knocks
means
Agrafena
*NL*
Alexandrovna
has
come
,
while
the
second
signal
of
three
knocks
means
*NL*
`
something
important
to
tell
you
.
'
His
honor
has
shown
me
them
several
*NL*
times
and
explained
them
.
And
as
in
the
whole
universe
no
one
knows
of
*NL*
these
signals
but
myself
and
his
honor
,
so
he
'd
open
the
door
without
the
*NL*
slightest
hesitation
and
without
calling
out
-LRB-
he
is
awfully
afraid
of
*NL*
calling
out
aloud
-RRB-
.
Well
,
those
signals
are
known
to
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
*NL*
too
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
they
known
?
Did
you
tell
him
?
How
dared
you
tell
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
through
fright
I
did
it
.
How
could
I
dare
to
keep
it
back
from
*NL*
him
?
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
kept
persisting
every
day
,
`
You
are
deceiving
me
,
*NL*
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
!
I
'll
break
both
your
legs
for
you
.
'
So
I
*NL*
told
him
those
secret
signals
that
he
might
see
my
slavish
devotion
,
and
*NL*
might
be
satisfied
that
I
was
not
deceiving
him
,
but
was
telling
him
all
I
*NL*
could
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

in

``
I
should
never

Grigory
Vassilyevitch
about

as
for
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
hearing

him

not
admitting
him
,
he
has
been
ill
ever
since
yesterday
,
and
Marfa
*NL*
Ignatyevna
intends
to
give
him
medicine
to-morrow
.
They
've
just
arranged
*NL*
it
.
It
's
a
very
strange
remedy
of
hers
.
Marfa
Ignatyevna
knows
of
a
*NL*
preparation
and
always
keeps
it
.
It
's
a
strong
thing
made
from
some
herb
.
*NL*
She
has
the
secret
of
it
,
and
she
always
gives
it
to
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
*NL*
three
times
a
year
when
his
lumbago
's
so
bad
he
is
almost
paralyzed
by
it
.
*NL*
Then
she
takes
a
towel
,
wets
it
with
the
stuff
,
and
rubs
his
whole
back
*NL*
for
half
an
hour
till
it
's
quite
red
and
swollen
,
and
what
's
left
in
the
*NL*
bottle
she
gives
him
to
drink
with
a
special
prayer
;
but
not
quite
all
,
*NL*
for
on
such
occasions
she
leaves
some
for
herself
,
and
drinks
it
herself
.
*NL*
And
as
they
never
take
strong
drink
,
I
assure
you
they
both
drop
asleep
at
*NL*
once
and
sleep
sound
a
very
long
time
.
And
when
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
*NL*
wakes
up
he
is
perfectly
well
after
it
,
but
Marfa
Ignatyevna
always
has
a
*NL*
headache
from
it
.
So
,
if
Marfa
Ignatyevna
carries
out
her
intention
to
-
*NL*
morrow
,
they
wo
n't
hear
anything
and
hinder
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
They
'll
*NL*
be
asleep
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a

*NL*
``

from

Ivan

white
with

*NL*
wo

break
in
on
him
if

does

*NL*
Speak

I
want
to
know
what
you
are
thinking

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
yourself
why
he
'll
come
.
What
's
the
use
of
what
I
think
?
His
*NL*
honor
will
come
simply
because
he
is
in
a
rage
or
suspicious
on
account
of
*NL*
my
illness
perhaps
,
and
he
'll
dash
in
,
as
he
did
yesterday
through
*NL*
impatience
to
search
the
rooms
,
to
see
whether
she
has
n't
escaped
him
on
*NL*
the
sly
.
He
is
perfectly
well
aware
,
too
,
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
has
a
big
*NL*
envelope
with
three
thousand
roubles
in
it
,
tied
up
with
ribbon
and
sealed
*NL*
with
three
seals
.
On
it
is
written
in
his
own
hand
,
`
To
my
angel
*NL*
Grushenka
,
if
she
will
come
,
'
to
which
he
added
three
days
later

`
for
my
*NL*
little
chicken
.
'
There
's
no
knowing
what
that
might
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
cried
Ivan
,
almost
beside
himself
.
``
Dmitri
wo
n't
come
to
steal
*NL*
money
and
kill
my
father
to
do
it
.
He
might
have
killed
him
yesterday
on
*NL*
account
of
Grushenka
,
like
the
frantic
,
savage
fool
he
is
,
but
he
wo
n't
*NL*
steal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
in
very
great
need
of
money
now
--
the
greatest
need
,
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
.
You
do
n't
know
in
what
need
he
is
,
''
Smerdyakov
explained
,
*NL*
with
perfect
composure
and
remarkable
distinctness
.
``
He
looks
on
that
*NL*
three
thousand
as
his
own
,
too
.
He
said
so
to
me
himself
.
`
My
father
still
*NL*
owes
me
just
three
thousand
,
'
he
said
.
And
besides
that
,
consider
,
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
there
is
something
else
perfectly
true
.
It
's
as
good
as
*NL*
certain
,
so
to
say
,
that
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
will
force
him
,
if
only
she
*NL*
cares
to
,
to
marry
her
--
the
master
himself
,
I
mean
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
--
if
*NL*
only
she
cares
to
,
and
of
course
she
may
care
to
.
All
I
've
said
is
that
*NL*
she
wo
n't
come
,
but
maybe
she
's
looking
for
more
than
that
--
I
mean
to
be
*NL*
mistress
here
.
I
know
myself
that
Samsonov
,
her
merchant
,
was
laughing
*NL*
with
her
about
it
,
telling
her
quite
openly
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
a
*NL*
stupid
thing
to
do
.
And
she
's
got
plenty
of
sense
.
She
would
n't
marry
a
*NL*
beggar
like
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
So
,
taking
that
into
consideration
,
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
reflect
that
then
neither
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
nor
yourself
*NL*
and
your
brother
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
would
have
anything
after
the
*NL*
master
's
death
,
not
a
rouble
,
for
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
would
marry
him
*NL*
simply
to
get
hold
of
the
whole
,
all
the
money
there
is
.
But
if
your
*NL*
father
were
to
die
now
,
there
'd
be
some
forty
thousand
for
sure
,
even
for
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
whom
he
hates
so
,
for
he
's
made
no
will
...
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
knows
all
that
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sort
of
shudder
passed
over
Ivan
's
face
.
He
suddenly
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
on
earth
,
''
he
suddenly
interrupted
Smerdyakov
,
``
do
you
advise
me
*NL*
to
go
to
Tchermashnya
?
What
did
you
mean
by
that
?
If
I
go
away
,
you
see
*NL*
what
will
happen
here
.
''
Ivan
drew
his
breath
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
,
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
softly
and
reasonably
,
watching
Ivan
*NL*
intently
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
`
precisely
so
'
?
''
Ivan
questioned
him
,
with
a
menacing
*NL*
light
in
his
eyes
,
restraining
himself
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spoke
because
I
felt
sorry
for
you
.
If
I
were
in
your
place
I
should
*NL*
simply
throw
it
all
up
...
rather
than
stay
on
in
such
a
position
,
''
*NL*
answered
Smerdyakov
,
with
the
most
candid
air
looking
at
Ivan
's
flashing
*NL*
eyes
.
They
were
both
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
be
a
perfect
idiot
,
and
what
's
more
...
an
awful
scoundrel
,
*NL*
too

''
Ivan
rose
suddenly
from
the
bench
.
He
was
about
to
pass
straight
*NL*
through
the
gate
,
but
he
stopped
short
and
turned
to
Smerdyakov
.
Something
*NL*
strange
followed
.
Ivan
,
in
a
sudden
paroxysm
,
bit
his
lip
,
clenched
his
*NL*
fists
,
and
,
in
another
minute
,
would
have
flung
himself
on
Smerdyakov
.
The
*NL*
latter
,
anyway
,
noticed
it
at
the
same
moment
,
started
,
and
shrank
back
.
*NL*
But
the
moment
passed
without
mischief
to
Smerdyakov
,
and
Ivan
turned
in
*NL*
silence
,
as
it
seemed
in
perplexity
,
to
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
away
to
Moscow
to-morrow
,
if
you
care
to
know
--
early
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
.
That
's
all
!
''
he
suddenly
said
aloud
angrily
,
and
wondered
himself
*NL*
afterwards
what
need
there
was
to
say
this
then
to
Smerdyakov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
best
thing
you
can
do
,
''
he
responded
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
expected
to
hear
it
;
``
except
that
you
can
always
be
telegraphed
for
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
if
anything
should
happen
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
stopped
again
,
and
again
turned
quickly
to
Smerdyakov
.
But
a
change
*NL*
had
passed
over
him
,
too
.
All
his
familiarity
and
carelessness
had
*NL*
completely
disappeared
.
His
face
expressed
attention
and
expectation
,
*NL*
intent
but
timid
and
cringing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
something
more
to
say
--
something
to
add
?
''
could
be
read
in
the
*NL*
intent
gaze
he
fixed
on
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
could
n't
I
be
sent
for
from
Tchermashnya
,
too
--
in
case
anything
*NL*
happened
?
''
Ivan
shouted
suddenly
,
for
some
unknown
reason
raising
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Tchermashnya
,
too
...
you
could
be
sent
for
,
''
Smerdyakov
muttered
,
*NL*
almost
in
a
whisper
,
looking
disconcerted
,
but
gazing
intently
into
Ivan
's
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
Moscow
is
farther
and
Tchermashnya
is
nearer
.
Is
it
to
save
my
*NL*
spending
money
on
the
fare
,
or
to
save
my
going
so
far
out
of
my
way
,
that
*NL*
you
insist
on
Tchermashnya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
...
''
muttered
Smerdyakov
,
with
a
breaking
voice
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
Ivan
with
a
revolting
smile
,
and
again
made
ready
to
draw
back
.
But
to
*NL*
his
astonishment
Ivan
broke
into
a
laugh
,
and
went
through
the
gate
still
*NL*
laughing
.
Any
one
who
had
seen
his
face
at
that
moment
would
have
known
*NL*
that
he
was
not
laughing
from
lightness
of
heart
,
and
he
could
not
have
*NL*
explained
himself
what
he
was
feeling
at
that
instant
.
He
moved
and
walked
*NL*
as
though
in
a
nervous
frenzy
.

``
It
's
Always
Worth
While
Speaking
To
A
Clever
Man
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
same
nervous
frenzy
,
too
,
he
spoke
.
Meeting
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
in
the
drawing-room
directly
he
went
in
,
he
shouted
to
him
,
waving
his
*NL*
hands
,
``
I
am
going
upstairs
to
my
room
,
not
in
to
you
.
Good-by
!
''
and
*NL*
passed
by
,
trying
not
even
to
look
at
his
father
.
Very
possibly
the
old
*NL*
man
was
too
hateful
to
him
at
that
moment
;
but
such
an
unceremonious
*NL*
display
of
hostility
was
a
surprise
even
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
And
the
old
*NL*
man
evidently
wanted
to
tell
him
something
at
once
and
had
come
to
meet
*NL*
him
in
the
drawing-room
on
purpose
.
Receiving
this
amiable
greeting
,
he
*NL*
stood
still
in
silence
and
with
an
ironical
air
watched
his
son
going
*NL*
upstairs
,
till
he
passed
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
''
he
promptly
asked
Smerdyakov
,
who
had
*NL*
followed
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angry
about
something
.
Who
can
tell
?
''
the
valet
muttered
evasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
him
!
Let
him
be
angry
then
.
Bring
in
the
samovar
,
and
get
along
*NL*
with
you
.
Look
sharp
!
No
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
followed
a
series
of
questions
such
as
Smerdyakov
had
just
complained
*NL*
of
to
Ivan
,
all
relating
to
his
expected
visitor
,
and
these
questions
we
*NL*
will
omit
.
Half
an
hour
later
the
house
was
locked
,
and
the
crazy
old
man
*NL*
was
wandering
along
through
the
rooms
in
excited
expectation
of
hearing
*NL*
every
minute
the
five
knocks
agreed
upon
.
Now
and
then
he
peered
out
into
*NL*
the
darkness
,
seeing
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
late
,
but
Ivan
was
still
awake
and
reflecting
.
He
sat
up
late
*NL*
that
night
,
till
two
o'clock
.
But
we
will
not
give
an
account
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
this
is
not
the
place
to
look
into
that
soul
--
its
turn
will
*NL*
come
.
And
even
if
one
tried
,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
give
an
account
of
*NL*
them
,
for
there
were
no
thoughts
in
his
brain
,
but
something
very
vague
,
*NL*
and
,
above
all
,
intense
excitement
.
He
felt
himself
that
he
had
lost
his
*NL*
bearings
.
He
was
fretted
,
too
,
by
all
sorts
of
strange
and
almost
*NL*
surprising
desires
;
for
instance
,
after
midnight
he
suddenly
had
an
*NL*
intense
irresistible
inclination
to
go
down
,
open
the
door
,
go
to
the
*NL*
lodge
and
beat
Smerdyakov
.
But
if
he
had
been
asked
why
,
he
could
not
have
*NL*
given
any
exact
reason
,
except
perhaps
that
he
loathed
the
valet
as
one
*NL*
who
had
insulted
him
more
gravely
than
any
one
in
the
world
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
he
was
more
than
once
that
night
overcome
by
a
sort
of
inexplicable
*NL*
humiliating
terror
,
which
he
felt
positively
paralyzed
his
physical
*NL*
powers
.
His
head
ached
and
he
was
giddy
.
A
feeling
of
hatred
was
rankling
*NL*
in
his
heart
,
as
though
he
meant
to
avenge
himself
on
some
one
.
He
even
*NL*
hated
Alyosha
,
recalling
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
with
him
.
At
*NL*
moments
he
hated
himself
intensely
.
Of
Katerina
Ivanovna
he
almost
forgot
*NL*
to
think
,
and
wondered
greatly
at
this
afterwards
,
especially
as
he
*NL*
remembered
perfectly
that
when
he
had
protested
so
valiantly
to
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
that
he
would
go
away
next
day
to
Moscow
,
something
had
whispered
*NL*
in
his
heart
,
``
That
's
nonsense
,
you
are
not
going
,
and
it
wo
n't
be
so
easy
*NL*
to
tear
yourself
away
as
you
are
boasting
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Remembering
that
night
long
afterwards
,
Ivan
recalled
with
peculiar
*NL*
repulsion
how
he
had
suddenly
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
had
stealthily
,
as
*NL*
though
he
were
afraid
of
being
watched
,
opened
the
door
,
gone
out
on
the
*NL*
staircase
and
listened
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
stirring
down
below
,
had
*NL*
listened
a
long
while
--
some
five
minutes
--
with
a
sort
of
strange
curiosity
,
*NL*
holding
his
breath
while
his
heart
throbbed
.
And
why
he
had
done
all
this
,
*NL*
why
he
was
listening
,
he
could
not
have
said
.
That
``
action
''
all
his
life
*NL*
afterwards
he
called
``
infamous
,
''
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
he
*NL*
thought
of
it
as
the
basest
action
of
his
life
.
For
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
himself
he
felt
no
hatred
at
that
moment
,
but
was
simply
intensely
curious
*NL*
to
know
how
he
was
walking
down
there
below
and
what
he
must
be
doing
now
.
*NL*
He
wondered
and
imagined
how
he
must
be
peeping
out
of
the
dark
windows
*NL*
and
stopping
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
listening
,
listening
--
for
some
one
*NL*
to
knock
.
Ivan
went
out
on
to
the
stairs
twice
to
listen
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
o'clock
when
everything
was
quiet
,
and
even
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
had
gone
to
bed
,
Ivan
had
got
into
bed
,
firmly
resolved
to
fall
asleep
at
*NL*
once
,
as
he
felt
fearfully
exhausted
.
And
he
did
fall
asleep
at
once
,
and
*NL*
slept
soundly
without
dreams
,
but
waked
early
,
at
seven
o'clock
,
when
it
*NL*
was
broad
daylight
.
Opening
his
eyes
,
he
was
surprised
to
feel
himself
*NL*
extraordinarily
vigorous
.
He
jumped
up
at
once
and
dressed
quickly
;
then
*NL*
dragged
out
his
trunk
and
began
packing
immediately
.
His
linen
had
come
*NL*
back
from
the
laundress
the
previous
morning
.
Ivan
positively
smiled
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
everything
was
helping
his
sudden
departure
.
And
his
*NL*
departure
certainly
was
sudden
.
Though
Ivan
had
said
the
day
before
-LRB-
to
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
Alyosha
,
and
Smerdyakov
-RRB-
that
he
was
leaving
next
day
,
*NL*
yet
he
remembered
that
he
had
no
thought
of
departure
when
he
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
or
,
at
least
,
had
not
dreamed
that
his
first
act
in
the
morning
would
be
*NL*
to
pack
his
trunk
.
At
last
his
trunk
and
bag
were
ready
.
It
was
about
nine
*NL*
o'clock
when
Marfa
Ignatyevna
came
in
with
her
usual
inquiry
,
``
Where
will
*NL*
your
honor
take
your
tea
,
in
your
own
room
or
downstairs
?
''
He
looked
*NL*
almost
cheerful
,
but
there
was
about
him
,
about
his
words
and
gestures
,
*NL*
something
hurried
and
scattered
.
Greeting
his
father
affably
,
and
even
*NL*
inquiring
specially
after
his
health
,
though
he
did
not
wait
to
hear
his
*NL*
answer
to
the
end
,
he
announced
that
he
was
starting
off
in
an
hour
to
*NL*
return
to
Moscow
for
good
,
and
begged
him
to
send
for
the
horses
.
His
*NL*
father
heard
this
announcement
with
no
sign
of
surprise
,
and
forgot
in
an
*NL*
unmannerly
way
to
show
regret
at
losing
him
.
Instead
of
doing
so
,
he
flew
*NL*
into
a
great
flutter
at
the
recollection
of
some
important
business
of
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fellow
you
are
!
Not
to
tell
me
yesterday
!
Never
mind
;
we
'll
manage
*NL*
it
all
the
same
.
Do
me
a
great
service
,
my
dear
boy
.
Go
to
Tchermashnya
on
*NL*
the
way
.
It
's
only
to
turn
to
the
left
from
the
station
at
Volovya
,
only
*NL*
another
twelve
versts
and
you
come
to
Tchermashnya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
I
ca
n't
.
It
's
eighty
versts
to
the
railway
and
the
train
*NL*
starts
for
Moscow
at
seven
o'clock
to-night
.
I
can
only
just
catch
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
catch
it
to-morrow
or
the
day
after
,
but
to-day
turn
off
to
*NL*
Tchermashnya
.
It
wo
n't
put
you
out
much
to
humor
your
father
!
If
I
had
n't
*NL*
had
something
to
keep
me
here
,
I
would
have
run
over
myself
long
ago
,
for
*NL*
I
've
some
business
there
in
a
hurry
.
But
here
I
...
it
's
not
the
time
for
*NL*
me
to
go
now
...
You
see
,
I
've
two
pieces
of
copse
land
there
.
The
*NL*
Maslovs
,
an
old
merchant
and
his
son
,
will
give
eight
thousand
for
the
*NL*
timber
.
But
last
year
I
just
missed
a
purchaser
who
would
have
given
*NL*
twelve
.
There
's
no
getting
any
one
about
here
to
buy
it
.
The
Maslovs
have
*NL*
it
all
their
own
way
.
One
has
to
take
what
they
'll
give
,
for
no
one
here
*NL*
dare
bid
against
them
.
The
priest
at
Ilyinskoe
wrote
to
me
last
Thursday
*NL*
that
a
merchant
called
Gorstkin
,
a
man
I
know
,
had
turned
up
.
What
makes
*NL*
him
valuable
is
that
he
is
not
from
these
parts
,
so
he
is
not
afraid
of
*NL*
the
Maslovs
.
He
says
he
will
give
me
eleven
thousand
for
the
copse
.
Do
you
*NL*
hear
?
But
he
'll
only
be
here
,
the
priest
writes
,
for
a
week
altogether
,
so
*NL*
you
must
go
at
once
and
make
a
bargain
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
write
to
the
priest
;
he
'll
make
the
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ca
n't
do
it
.
He
has
no
eye
for
business
.
He
is
a
perfect
treasure
,
I
'd
*NL*
give
him
twenty
thousand
to
take
care
of
for
me
without
a
receipt
;
but
he
*NL*
has
no
eye
for
business
,
he
is
a
perfect
child
,
a
crow
could
deceive
him
.
*NL*
And
yet
he
is
a
learned
man
,
would
you
believe
it
?
This
Gorstkin
looks
*NL*
like
a
peasant
,
he
wears
a
blue
kaftan
,
but
he
is
a
regular
rogue
.
That
's
*NL*
the
common
complaint
.
He
is
a
liar
.
Sometimes
he
tells
such
lies
that
you
*NL*
wonder
why
he
is
doing
it
.
He
told
me
the
year
before
last
that
his
wife
*NL*
was
dead
and
that
he
had
married
another
,
and
would
you
believe
it
,
there
*NL*
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
?
His
wife
has
never
died
at
all
,
she
is
*NL*
alive
to
this
day
and
gives
him
a
beating
twice
a
week
.
So
what
you
have
*NL*
to
find
out
is
whether
he
is
lying
or
speaking
the
truth
,
when
he
says
he
*NL*
wants
to
buy
it
and
would
give
eleven
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
no
use
in
such
a
business
.
I
have
no
eye
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
wait
a
bit
!
You
will
be
of
use
,
for
I
will
tell
you
the
signs
by
*NL*
which
you
can
judge
about
Gorstkin
.
I
've
done
business
with
him
a
long
*NL*
time
.
You
see
,
you
must
watch
his
beard
;
he
has
a
nasty
,
thin
,
red
beard
.
*NL*
If
his
beard
shakes
when
he
talks
and
he
gets
cross
,
it
's
all
right
,
he
is
*NL*
saying
what
he
means
,
he
wants
to
do
business
.
But
if
he
strokes
his
beard
*NL*
with
his
left
hand
and
grins
--
he
is
trying
to
cheat
you
.
Do
n't
watch
his
*NL*
eyes
,
you
wo
n't
find
out
anything
from
his
eyes
,
he
is
a
deep
one
,
a
*NL*
rogue
--
but
watch
his
beard
!
I
'll
give
you
a
note
and
you
show
it
to
him
.
*NL*
He
's
called
Gorstkin
,
though
his
real
name
is
Lyagavy
-LRB-
4
-RRB-
;
but
do
n't
call
*NL*
him
so
,
he
will
be
offended
.
If
you
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
,
and
*NL*
see
it
's
all
right
,
write
here
at
once
.
You
need
only
write
:
`
He
's
not
*NL*
lying
.
'
Stand
out
for
eleven
thousand
;
one
thousand
you
can
knock
off
,
but
*NL*
not
more
.
Just
think
!
there
's
a
difference
between
eight
thousand
and
*NL*
eleven
thousand
.
It
's
as
good
as
picking
up
three
thousand
;
it
's
not
so
*NL*
easy
to
find
a
purchaser
,
and
I
'm
in
desperate
need
of
money
.
Only
let
me
*NL*
know
it
's
serious
,
and
I
'll
run
over
and
fix
it
up
.
I
'll
snatch
the
time
*NL*
somehow
.
But
what
's
the
good
of
my
galloping
over
,
if
it
's
all
a
notion
of
*NL*
the
priest
's
?
Come
,
will
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca

spare
the
time

You
must
excuse
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

you
might
oblige
your

I

You

any

What

a

Where

going
now

to
Venice

Your
Venice

Alyosha
in
a
thing

I
send

to
go
to
that
damned
Tchermashnya

cried
*NL*
Ivan
,
with
a
malignant
smile

*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
did
not
catch
,
or
would
not
catch

the
malignancy
,

*NL*
he
caught
the
smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

at

And
I

more
than

will

*NL*
The
old
man
was
quite
delighted
.
He
wrote
the
note
,
and
sent
for
the
*NL*
horses
.
A
light
lunch
was
brought
in
,
with
brandy
.
When
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
was
pleased
,
he
usually
became
expansive
,
but
to-day
he
seemed
to
restrain
*NL*
himself
.
Of
Dmitri
,
for
instance
,
he
did
not
say
a
word
.
He
was
quite
*NL*
unmoved
by
the
parting
,
and
seemed
,
in
fact
,
at
a
loss
for
something
to
*NL*
say
.
Ivan
noticed
this
particularly
.
``
He
must
be
bored
with
me
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
Only
when
accompanying
his
son
out
on
to
the
steps
,
the
old
man
*NL*
began
to
fuss
about
.
He
would
have
kissed
him
,
but
Ivan
made
haste
to
hold
*NL*
out
his
hand
,
obviously
avoiding
the
kiss
.
His
father
saw
it
at
once
,
and
*NL*
instantly
pulled
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good
luck
to
you
,
good
luck
to
you
!
''
he
repeated
from
the
steps
.
*NL*
``
You
'll
come
again
some
time
or
other
?
Mind
you
do
come
.
I
shall
always
be
*NL*
glad
to
see
you
.
Well
,
Christ
be
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
got
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Ivan
!
Do
n't
be
too
hard
on
me
!
''
the
father
called
for
the
last
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
household
came
out
to
take

Smerdyakov
,
Marfa
and
Grigory
.
*NL*
Ivan
gave
them
ten
roubles
each
.
When
he
had
seated
himself
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
Smerdyakov
jumped
up
to
arrange
the
rug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
...
I
am
going
to
Tchermashnya
,
''
broke
suddenly
from
Ivan
.
Again
,
*NL*
as
the
day
before
,
the
words
seemed
to
drop
of
themselves
,
and
he
laughed
,
*NL*
too
,
a
peculiar
,
nervous
laugh
.
He
remembered
it
long
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
true
saying
then
,
that
`
it
's
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
*NL*
clever
man
,
'
''
answered
Smerdyakov
firmly
,
looking
significantly
at
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
rolled
away
.
Nothing
was
clear
in
Ivan
's
soul
,
but
he
looked
*NL*
eagerly
around
him
at
the
fields
,
at
the
hills
,
at
the
trees
,
at
a
flock
*NL*
of
geese
flying
high
overhead
in
the
bright
sky
.
And
all
of
a
sudden
he
*NL*
felt
very
happy
.
He
tried
to
talk
to
the
driver
,
and
he
felt
intensely
*NL*
interested
in
an
answer
the
peasant
made
him
;
but
a
minute
later
he
*NL*
realized
that
he
was
not
catching
anything
,
and
that
he
had
not
really
*NL*
even
taken
in
the
peasant
's
answer
.
He
was
silent
,
and
it
was
pleasant
*NL*
even
so
.
The
air
was
fresh
,
pure
and
cool
,
the
sky
bright
.
The
images
of
*NL*
Alyosha
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
floated
into
his
mind
.
But
he
softly
smiled
,
*NL*
blew
softly
on
the
friendly
phantoms
,
and
they
flew
away
.
``
There
's
plenty
*NL*
of
time
for
them
,
''
he
thought
.
They
reached
the
station
quickly
,
changed
*NL*
horses
,
and
galloped
to
Volovya
.
``
Why
is
it
worth
while
speaking
to
a
*NL*
clever
man
?
What
did
he
mean
by
that
?
''
The
thought
seemed
suddenly
to
*NL*
clutch
at
his
breathing
.
``
And
why
did
I
tell
him
I
was
going
to
*NL*
Tchermashnya
?
''
They
reached
Volovya
station
.
Ivan
got
out
of
the
carriage
,
*NL*
and
the
drivers
stood
round
him
bargaining
over
the
journey
of
twelve
*NL*
versts
to
Tchermashnya
.
He
told
them
to
harness
the
horses
.
He
went
into
*NL*
the
station
house
,
looked
round
,
glanced
at
the
overseer
's
wife
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
went
back
to
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
go
to
Tchermashnya
.
Am
I
too
late
to
reach
the
railway
by
seven
,
*NL*
brothers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
just
do
it
.
Shall
we
get
the
carriage
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
.
Will
any
one
of
you
be
going
to
the
town
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
.
Mitri
here
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
do
me
a
service
,
Mitri
?
Go
to
my
father
's
,
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
Karamazov
,
and
tell
him
I
have
n't
gone
to
Tchermashnya
.
Can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
can
.
I
've
known
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
's
something
for
you
,
for
I
dare
say
he
wo
n't
give
you
anything
,
''
*NL*
said
Ivan
,
laughing
gayly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
depend
on
it
he
wo
n't
.
''
Mitya
laughed
too
.
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
I
'll
*NL*
be
sure
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
Ivan
got
into
the
train
and
set
off
to
Moscow
``
Away
with
*NL*
the
past
.
I
've
done
with
the
old
world
for
ever
,
and
may
I
have
no
news
,
*NL*
no
echo
,
from
it
.
To
a
new
life
,
new
places
and
no
looking
back
!
''
But
*NL*
instead
of
delight
his
soul
was
filled
with
such
gloom
,
and
his
heart
*NL*
ached
with
such
anguish
,
as
he
had
never
known
in
his
life
before
.
He
was
*NL*
thinking
all
the
night
.
The
train
flew
on
,
and
only
at
daybreak
,
when
he
*NL*
was
approaching
Moscow
,
he
suddenly
roused
himself
from
his
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
scoundrel
,
''
he
whispered
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
remained
well
satisfied
at
having
seen
his
son
off
.
For
*NL*
two
hours
afterwards
he
felt
almost
happy
,
and
sat
drinking
brandy
.
But
*NL*
suddenly
something
happened
which
was
very
annoying
and
unpleasant
for
*NL*
every
one
in
the
house
,
and
completely
upset
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
equanimity
at
once
.
Smerdyakov
went
to
the
cellar
for
something
and
fell
*NL*
down
from
the
top
of
the
steps
.
Fortunately
,
Marfa
Ignatyevna
was
in
the
*NL*
yard
and
heard
him
in
time
.
She
did
not
see
the
fall
,
but
heard
his
*NL*
scream
--
the
strange
,
peculiar
scream
,
long
familiar
to
her
--
the
scream
of
*NL*
the
epileptic
falling
in
a
fit
.
They
could
not
tell
whether
the
fit
had
*NL*
come
on
him
at
the
moment
he
was
descending
the
steps
,
so
that
he
must
*NL*
have
fallen
unconscious
,
or
whether
it
was
the
fall
and
the
shock
that
had
*NL*
caused
the
fit
in
Smerdyakov
,
who
was
known
to
be
liable
to
them
.
They
*NL*
found
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
steps
,
writhing
in
convulsions
and
*NL*
foaming
at
the
mouth
.
It
was
thought
at
first
that
he
must
have
broken
*NL*
something
--
an
arm
or
a
leg
--
and
hurt
himself
,
but
``
God
had
preserved
him
,
''
*NL*
as
Marfa
Ignatyevna
expressed
it
--
nothing
of
the
kind
had
happened
.
But
it
*NL*
was
difficult
to
get
him
out
of
the
cellar
.
They
asked
the
neighbors
to
*NL*
help
and
managed
it
somehow
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
himself
was
present
at
the
*NL*
whole
ceremony
.
He
helped
,
evidently
alarmed
and
upset
.
The
sick
man
did
*NL*
not
regain
consciousness
;
the
convulsions
ceased
for
a
time
,
but
then
*NL*
began
again
,
and
every
one
concluded
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
,
as
*NL*
had
happened
a
year
before
,
when
he
accidentally
fell
from
the
garret
.
*NL*
They
remembered
that
ice
had
been
put
on
his
head
then
.
There
was
still
*NL*
ice
in
the
cellar
,
and
Marfa
Ignatyevna
had
some
brought
up
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
sent
for
Doctor
Herzenstube
,
who
arrived
at
*NL*
once
.
He
was
a
most
estimable
old
man
,
and
the
most
careful
and
*NL*
conscientious
doctor
in
the
province
.
After
careful
examination
,
he
*NL*
concluded
that
the
fit
was
a
very
violent
one
and
might
have
serious
*NL*
consequences
;
that
meanwhile
he
,
Herzenstube
,
did
not
fully
understand
it
,
*NL*
but
that
by
to-morrow
morning
,
if
the
present
remedies
were
unavailing
,
he
*NL*
would
venture
to
try
something
else
.
The
invalid
was
taken
to
the
lodge
,
*NL*
to
a
room
next
to
Grigory
's
and
Marfa
Ignatyevna
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
one
misfortune
after
another
to
put
up
with
*NL*
that
day
.
Marfa
Ignatyevna
cooked
the
dinner
,
and
the
soup
,
compared
with
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
,
was
``
no
better
than
dish-water
,
''
and
the
fowl
was
so
dried
*NL*
up
that
it
was
impossible
to
masticate
it
.
To
her
master
's
bitter
,
though
*NL*
deserved
,
reproaches
,
Marfa
Ignatyevna
replied
that
the
fowl
was
a
very
*NL*
old
one
to
begin
with
,
and
that
she
had
never
been
trained
as
a
cook
.
In
*NL*
the
evening
there
was
another
trouble
in
store
for
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
;
he
*NL*
was
informed
that
Grigory
,
who
had
not
been
well
for
the
last
three
days
,
*NL*
was
completely
laid
up
by
his
lumbago
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
finished
his
tea
*NL*
as
early
as
possible
and
locked
himself
up
alone
in
the
house
.
He
was
in
*NL*
terrible
excitement
and
suspense
.
That
evening
he
reckoned
on
Grushenka
's
*NL*
coming
almost
as
a
certainty
.
He
had
received
from
Smerdyakov
that
morning
*NL*
an
assurance
``
that
she
had
promised
to
come
without
fail
.
''
The
*NL*
incorrigible
old
man
's
heart
throbbed
with
excitement
;
he
paced
up
and
*NL*
down
his
empty
rooms
listening
.
He
had
to
be
on
the
alert
.
Dmitri
might
be
*NL*
on
the
watch
for
her
somewhere
,
and
when
she
knocked
on
the
window
*NL*
-LRB-
Smerdyakov
had
informed
him
two
days
before
that
he
had
told
her
where
*NL*
and
how
to
knock
-RRB-
the
door
must
be
opened
at
once
.
She
must
not
be
a
*NL*
second
in
the
passage
,
for
fear
--
which
God
forbid
!
--
that
she
should
be
*NL*
frightened
and
run
away
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
much
to
think
of
,
but
never
*NL*
had
his
heart
been
steeped
in
such
voluptuous
hopes
.
This
time
he
could
*NL*
say
almost
certainly
that
she
would
come
!

Monk

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I.
Father
Zossima
And
His
Visitors
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
with
an
anxious
and
aching
heart
Alyosha
went
into
his
elder
's
cell
,
*NL*
he
stood
still
almost
astonished
.
Instead
of
a
sick
man
at
his
last
gasp
,
*NL*
perhaps
unconscious
,
as
he
had
feared
to
find
him
,
he
saw
him
sitting
up
*NL*
in
his
chair
and
,
though
weak
and
exhausted
,
his
face
was
bright
and
*NL*
cheerful
,
he
was
surrounded
by
visitors
and
engaged
in
a
quiet
and
joyful
*NL*
conversation
.
But
he
had
only
got
up
from
his
bed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
before
Alyosha
's
arrival
;
his
visitors
had
gathered
together
in
his
cell
*NL*
earlier
,
waiting
for
him
to
wake
,
having
received
a
most
confident
*NL*
assurance
from
Father
Paissy
that
``
the
teacher
would
get
up
,
and
as
he
had
*NL*
himself
promised
in
the
morning
,
converse
once
more
with
those
dear
to
his
*NL*
heart
.
''
This
promise
and
indeed
every
word
of
the
dying
elder
Father
*NL*
Paissy
put
implicit
trust
in
.
If
he
had
seen
him
unconscious
,
if
he
had
*NL*
seen
him
breathe
his
last
,
and
yet
had
his
promise
that
he
would
rise
up
*NL*
and
say
good-by
to
him
,
he
would
not
have
believed
perhaps
even
in
death
,
*NL*
but
would
still
have
expected
the
dead
man
to
recover
and
fulfill
his
*NL*
promise
.
In
the
morning
as
he
lay
down
to
sleep
,
Father
Zossima
had
told
*NL*
him
positively
:
``
I
shall
not
die
without
the
delight
of
another
*NL*
conversation
with
you
,
beloved
of
my
heart
.
I
shall
look
once
more
on
your
*NL*
dear
face
and
pour
out
my
heart
to
you
once
again
.
''
The
monks
,
who
had
*NL*
gathered
for
this
probably
last
conversation
with
Father
Zossima
,
had
all
*NL*
been
his
devoted
friends
for
many
years
.
There
were
four
of
them
:
Father
*NL*
Iosif
and
Father
Paissy
,
Father
Mihail
,
the
warden
of
the
hermitage
,
a
man
*NL*
not
very
old
and
far
from
being
learned
.
He
was
of
humble
origin
,
of
*NL*
strong
will
and
steadfast
faith
,
of
austere
appearance
,
but
of
deep
*NL*
tenderness
,
though
he
obviously
concealed
it
as
though
he
were
almost
*NL*
ashamed
of
it
.
The
fourth
,
Father
Anfim
,
was
a
very
old
and
humble
little
*NL*
monk
of
the
poorest
peasant
class
.
He
was
almost
illiterate
,
and
very
*NL*
quiet
,
scarcely
speaking
to
any
one
.
He
was
the
humblest
of
the
humble
,
*NL*
and
looked
as
though
he
had
been
frightened
by
something
great
and
awful
*NL*
beyond
the
scope
of
his
intelligence
.
Father
Zossima
had
a
great
affection
*NL*
for
this
timorous
man
,
and
always
treated
him
with
marked
respect
,
though
*NL*
perhaps
there
was
no
one
he
had
known
to
whom
he
had
said
less
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
fact
that
he
had
spent
years
wandering
about
holy
Russia
with
him
.
*NL*
That
was
very
long
ago
,
forty
years
before
,
when
Father
Zossima
first
*NL*
began
his
life
as
a
monk
in
a
poor
and
little
monastery
at
Kostroma
,
and
*NL*
when
,
shortly
after
,
he
had
accompanied
Father
Anfim
on
his
pilgrimage
to
*NL*
collect
alms
for
their
poor
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
party
were
in
the
bedroom
which
,
as
we
mentioned
before
,
was
*NL*
very
small
,
so
that
there
was
scarcely
room
for
the
four
of
them
-LRB-
in
*NL*
addition
to
Porfiry
,
the
novice
,
who
stood
-RRB-
to
sit
round
Father
Zossima
on
*NL*
chairs
brought
from
the
sitting-room
.
It
was
already
beginning
to
get
*NL*
dark
,
the
room
was
lighted
up
by
the
lamps
and
the
candles
before
the
*NL*
ikons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
Alyosha
standing
embarrassed
in
the
doorway
,
Father
Zossima
smiled
*NL*
at
him
joyfully
and
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
,
my
quiet
one
,
welcome
,
my
dear
,
here
you
are
too
.
I
knew
you
*NL*
would
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
up
to
him
,
bowed
down
before
him
to
the
ground
and
wept
.
*NL*
Something
surged
up
from
his
heart
,
his
soul
was
quivering
,
he
wanted
to
*NL*
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
do
n't
weep
over
me
yet
,
''
Father
Zossima
smiled
,
laying
his
right
*NL*
hand
on
his
head
.
``
You
see
I
am
sitting
up
talking
;
maybe
I
shall
live
*NL*
another
twenty
years
yet
,
as
that
dear
good
woman
from
Vishegorye
,
with
*NL*
her
little
Lizaveta
in
her
arms
,
wished
me
yesterday
.
God
bless
the
mother
*NL*
and
the
little
girl
Lizaveta
,
''
he
crossed
himself
.
``
Porfiry
,
did
you
take
*NL*
her
offering
where
I
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
the
sixty
copecks
brought
him
the
day
before
by
the
good-humored
*NL*
woman
to
be
given
``
to
some
one
poorer
than
me
.
''
Such
offerings
,
always
of
*NL*
money
gained
by
personal
toil
,
are
made
by
way
of
penance
voluntarily
*NL*
undertaken
.
The
elder
had
sent
Porfiry
the
evening
before
to
a
widow
,
*NL*
whose
house
had
been
burnt
down
lately
,
and
who
after
the
fire
had
gone
*NL*
with
her
children
begging
alms
.
Porfiry
hastened
to
reply
that
he
had
*NL*
given
the
money
,
as
he
had
been
instructed
,
``
from
an
unknown
*NL*
benefactress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
,
my
dear
boy
,
''
the
elder
went
on
to
Alyosha
.
``
Let
me
look
at
you
.
*NL*
Have
you
been
home
and
seen
your
brother
?
''
It
seemed
strange
to
Alyosha
*NL*
that
he
asked
so
confidently
and
precisely
,
about
one
of
his
brothers
*NL*
only
--
but
which
one
?
Then
perhaps
he
had
sent
him
out
both
yesterday
and
*NL*
to-day
for
the
sake
of
that
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
one
of
my
brothers
,
''
answered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
the
elder
one
,
to
whom
I
bowed
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
saw
him
yesterday
and
could
not
find
him
to-day
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
to
find
him
,
go
again
to-morrow
and
make
haste
,
leave
*NL*
everything
and
make
haste
.
Perhaps
you
may
still
have
time
to
prevent
*NL*
something
terrible
.
I
bowed
down
yesterday
to
the
great
suffering
in
store
*NL*
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
suddenly
silent
and
seemed
to
be
pondering
.
The
words
were
strange
.
*NL*
Father
Iosif
,
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
yesterday
,
exchanged
glances
*NL*
with
Father
Paissy
.
Alyosha
could
not
resist
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
and
teacher
,
''
he
began
with
extreme
emotion
,
``
your
words
are
too
*NL*
obscure
...
What
is
this
suffering
in
store
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
inquire
.
I
seemed
to
see
something
terrible
yesterday
...
as
though
*NL*
his
whole
future
were
expressed
in
his
eyes
.
A
look
came
into
his
eyes
--
so
*NL*
that
I
was
instantly
horror-stricken
at
what
that
man
is
preparing
for
*NL*
himself
.
Once
or
twice
in
my
life
I
've
seen
such
a
look
in
a
man
's
face
*NL*
...
reflecting
as
it
were
his
future
fate
,
and
that
fate
,
alas
,
came
to
*NL*
pass
.
I
sent
you
to
him
,
Alexey
,
for
I
thought
your
brotherly
face
would
*NL*
help
him
.
But
everything
and
all
our
fates
are
from
the
Lord
.
`
Except
a
*NL*
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
die
,
it
abideth
alone
;
but
if
it
*NL*
die
,
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
.
'
Remember
that
.
You
,
Alexey
,
I
've
many
*NL*
times
silently
blessed
for
your
face
,
know
that
,
''
added
the
elder
with
a
*NL*
gentle
smile
.
``
This
is
what
I
think
of
you
,
you
will
go
forth
from
these
*NL*
walls
,
but
will
live
like
a
monk
in
the
world
.
You
will
have
many
enemies
,
*NL*
but
even
your
foes
will
love
you
.
Life
will
bring
you
many
misfortunes
,
*NL*
but
you
will
find
your
happiness
in
them
,
and
will
bless
life
and
will
*NL*
make
others
bless
it
--
which
is
what
matters
most
.
Well
,
that
is
your
*NL*
character
.
Fathers
and
teachers
,
''
he
addressed
his
friends
with
a
tender
*NL*
smile
,
``
I
have
never
till
to-day
told
even
him
why
the
face
of
this
youth
*NL*
is
so
dear
to
me
.
Now
I
will
tell
you
.
His
face
has
been
as
it
were
a
*NL*
remembrance
and
a
prophecy
for
me
.
At
the
dawn
of
my
life
when
I
was
a
*NL*
child
I
had
an
elder
brother
who
died
before
my
eyes
at
seventeen
.
And
*NL*
later
on
in
the
course
of
my
life
I
gradually
became
convinced
that
that
*NL*
brother
had
been
for
a
guidance
and
a
sign
from
on
high
for
me
.
For
had
he
*NL*
not
come
into
my
life
,
I
should
never
perhaps
,
so
I
fancy
at
least
,
have
*NL*
become
a
monk
and
entered
on
this
precious
path
.
He
appeared
first
to
me
*NL*
in
my
childhood
,
and
here
,
at
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
,
he
seems
to
have
*NL*
come
to
me
over
again
.
It
is
marvelous
,
fathers
and
teachers
,
that
Alexey
,
*NL*
who
has
some
,
though
not
a
great
,
resemblance
in
face
,
seems
to
me
so
like
*NL*
him
spiritually
,
that
many
times
I
have
taken
him
for
that
young
man
,
my
*NL*
brother
,
mysteriously
come
back
to
me
at
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
,
as
a
*NL*
reminder
and
an
inspiration
.
So
that
I
positively
wondered
at
so
strange
a
*NL*
dream
in
myself
.
Do
you
hear
this
,
Porfiry
?
''
he
turned
to
the
novice
who
*NL*
waited
on
him
.
``
Many
times
I
've
seen
in
your
face
as
it
were
a
look
of
*NL*
mortification
that
I
love
Alexey
more
than
you
.
Now
you
know
why
that
was
*NL*
so
,
but
I
love
you
too
,
know
that
,
and
many
times
I
grieved
at
your
*NL*
mortification
.
I
should
like
to
tell
you
,
dear
friends
,
of
that
youth
,
my
*NL*
brother
,
for
there
has
been
no
presence
in
my
life
more
precious
,
more
*NL*
significant
and
touching
.
My
heart
is
full
of
tenderness
,
and
I
look
at
my
*NL*
whole
life
at
this
moment
as
though
living
through
it
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
-------------------------------------
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
must
observe
that
this
last
conversation
of
Father
Zossima
with
the
*NL*
friends
who
visited
him
on
the
last
day
of
his
life
has
been
partly
*NL*
preserved
in
writing
.
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
wrote
it
down
from
*NL*
memory
,
some
time
after
his
elder
's
death
.
But
whether
this
was
only
the
*NL*
conversation
that
took
place
then
,
or
whether
he
added
to
it
his
notes
of
*NL*
parts
of
former
conversations
with
his
teacher
,
I
can
not
determine
.
In
his
*NL*
account
,
Father
Zossima
's
talk
goes
on
without
interruption
,
as
though
he
*NL*
told
his
life
to
his
friends
in
the
form
of
a
story
,
though
there
is
no
*NL*
doubt
,
from
other
accounts
of
it
,
that
the
conversation
that
evening
was
*NL*
general
.
Though
the
guests
did
not
interrupt
Father
Zossima
much
,
yet
they
*NL*
too
talked
,
perhaps
even
told
something
themselves
.
Besides
,
Father
*NL*
Zossima
could
not
have
carried
on
an
uninterrupted
narrative
,
for
he
was
*NL*
sometimes
gasping
for
breath
,
his
voice
failed
him
,
and
he
even
lay
down
*NL*
to
rest
on
his
bed
,
though
he
did
not
fall
asleep
and
his
visitors
did
not
*NL*
leave
their
seats
.
Once
or
twice
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
*NL*
Father
Paissy
's
reading
the
Gospel
.
It
is
worthy
of
note
,
too
,
that
no
one
*NL*
of
them
supposed
that
he
would
die
that
night
,
for
on
that
evening
of
his
*NL*
life
after
his
deep
sleep
in
the
day
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
found
new
*NL*
strength
,
which
kept
him
up
through
this
long
conversation
.
It
was
like
a
*NL*
last
effort
of
love
which
gave
him
marvelous
energy
;
only
for
a
little
*NL*
time
,
however
,
for
his
life
was
cut
short
immediately
...
But
of
that
*NL*
later
.
I
will
only
add
now
that
I
have
preferred
to
confine
myself
to
the
*NL*
account
given
by
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
.
It
will
be
shorter
and
not
*NL*
so
fatiguing
,
though
of
course
,
as
I
must
repeat
,
Alyosha
took
a
great
*NL*
deal
from
previous
conversations
and
added
them
to
it
.

Father

Brother
_
*NL*
*NL*
Beloved
fathers
and
teachers
,
I
was
born
in
a
distant
province
in
the
*NL*
north
,
in
the
town
of
V.
My
father
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
,
but
of
no
*NL*
great
consequence
or
position
.
He
died
when
I
was
only
two
years
old
,
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
remember
him
at
all
.
He
left
my
mother
a
small
house
built
of
*NL*
wood
,
and
a
fortune
,
not
large
,
but
sufficient
to
keep
her
and
her
*NL*
children
in
comfort
.
There
were
two
of
us
,
my
elder
brother
Markel
and
I
.
*NL*
He
was
eight
years
older
than
I
was
,
of
hasty
irritable
temperament
,
but
*NL*
kind-hearted
and
never
ironical
.
He
was
remarkably
silent
,
especially
at
*NL*
home
with
me
,
his
mother
,
and
the
servants
.
He
did
well
at
school
,
but
did
*NL*
not
get
on
with
his
schoolfellows
,
though
he
never
quarreled
,
at
least
so
*NL*
my
mother
has
told
me
.
Six
months
before
his
death
,
when
he
was
seventeen
,
*NL*
he
made
friends
with
a
political
exile
who
had
been
banished
from
Moscow
*NL*
to
our
town
for
freethinking
,
and
led
a
solitary
existence
there
.
He
was
a
*NL*
good
scholar
who
had
gained
distinction
in
philosophy
in
the
university
.
*NL*
Something
made
him
take
a
fancy
to
Markel
,
and
he
used
to
ask
him
to
see
*NL*
him
.
The
young
man
would
spend
whole
evenings
with
him
during
that
winter
,
*NL*
till
the
exile
was
summoned
to
Petersburg
to
take
up
his
post
again
at
his
*NL*
own
request
,
as
he
had
powerful
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
Lent
,
and
Markel
would
not
fast
,
he
was
rude
and
*NL*
laughed
at
it
.
``
That
's
all
silly
twaddle
,
and
there
is
no
God
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
horrifying
my
mother
,
the
servants
,
and
me
too
.
For
though
I
was
only
*NL*
nine
,
I
too
was
aghast
at
hearing
such
words
.
We
had
four
servants
,
all
*NL*
serfs
.
I
remember
my
mother
selling
one
of
the
four
,
the
cook
Afimya
,
who
*NL*
was
lame
and
elderly
,
for
sixty
paper
roubles
,
and
hiring
a
free
servant
*NL*
to
take
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
sixth
week
in
Lent
,
my
brother
,
who
was
never
strong
and
had
a
*NL*
tendency
to
consumption
,
was
taken
ill
.
He
was
tall
but
thin
and
delicate
-
*NL*
looking
,
and
of
very
pleasing
countenance
.
I
suppose
he
caught
cold
,
*NL*
anyway
the
doctor
,
who
came
,
soon
whispered
to
my
mother
that
it
was
*NL*
galloping
consumption
,
that
he
would
not
live
through
the
spring
.
My
*NL*
mother
began
weeping
,
and
,
careful
not
to
alarm
my
brother
,
she
entreated
*NL*
him
to
go
to
church
,
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
,
as
he
was
still
*NL*
able
to
move
about
.
This
made
him
angry
,
and
he
said
something
profane
*NL*
about
the
church
.
He
grew
thoughtful
,
however
;
he
guessed
at
once
that
he
*NL*
was
seriously
ill
,
and
that
that
was
why
his
mother
was
begging
him
to
*NL*
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
.
He
had
been
aware
,
indeed
,
for
a
long
time
*NL*
past
,
that
he
was
far
from
well
,
and
had
a
year
before
coolly
observed
at
*NL*
dinner
to
our
mother
and
me
,
``
My
life
wo
n't
be
long
among
you
,
I
may
not
*NL*
live
another
year
,
''
which
seemed
now
like
a
prophecy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
passed
and
Holy
Week
had
come
.
And
on
Tuesday
morning
my
*NL*
brother
began
going
to
church
.
``
I
am
doing
this
simply
for
your
sake
,
*NL*
mother
,
to
please
and
comfort
you
,
''
he
said
.
My
mother
wept
with
joy
and
*NL*
grief
.
``
His
end
must
be
near
,
''
she
thought
,
``
if
there
's
such
a
change
in
*NL*
him
.
''
But
he
was
not
able
to
go
to
church
long
,
he
took
to
his
bed
,
so
he
*NL*
had
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
late
Easter
,
and
the
days
were
bright
,
fine
,
and
full
of
*NL*
fragrance
.
I
remember
he
used
to
cough
all
night
and
sleep
badly
,
but
in
*NL*
the
morning
he
dressed
and
tried
to
sit
up
in
an
arm-chair
.
That
's
how
I
*NL*
remember
him
sitting
,
sweet
and
gentle
,
smiling
,
his
face
bright
and
*NL*
joyous
,
in
spite
of
his
illness
.
A
marvelous
change
passed
over
him
,
his
*NL*
spirit
seemed
transformed
.
The
old
nurse
would
come
in
and
say
,
``
Let
me
*NL*
light
the
lamp
before
the
holy
image
,
my
dear
.
''
And
once
he
would
not
have
*NL*
allowed
it
and
would
have
blown
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Light
it
,
light
it
,
dear
,
I
was
a
wretch
to
have
prevented
you
doing
it
.
*NL*
You
are
praying
when
you
light
the
lamp
,
and
I
am
praying
when
I
rejoice
*NL*
seeing
you
.
So
we
are
praying
to
the
same
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
words
seemed
strange
to
us
,
and
mother
would
go
to
her
room
and
*NL*
weep
,
but
when
she
went
in
to
him
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
looked
cheerful
.
*NL*
``
Mother
,
do
n't
weep
,
darling
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
I
've
long
to
live
yet
,
long
*NL*
to
rejoice
with
you
,
and
life
is
glad
and
joyful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
boy
,
how
can
you
talk
of
joy
when
you
lie
feverish
at
night
,
*NL*
coughing
as
though
you
would
tear
yourself
to
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
mother
,
''
he
would
answer
,
``
life
is
paradise
,
and
we
are
all
in
*NL*
paradise
,
but
we
wo
n't
see
it
,
if
we
would
,
we
should
have
heaven
on
earth
*NL*
the
next
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
wondered
at
his
words
,
he
spoke
so
strangely
and
positively
;
we
*NL*
were
all
touched
and
wept
.
Friends
came
to
see
us
.
``
Dear
ones
,
''
he
would
*NL*
say
to
them
,
``
what
have
I
done
that
you
should
love
me
so
,
how
can
you
*NL*
love
any
one
like
me
,
and
how
was
it
I
did
not
know
,
I
did
not
appreciate
*NL*
it
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
servants
came
in
to
him
he
would
say
continually
,
``
Dear
,
kind
*NL*
people
,
why
are
you
doing
so
much
for
me
,
do
I
deserve
to
be
waited
on
?
If
*NL*
it
were
God
's
will
for
me
to
live
,
I
would
wait
on
you
,
for
all
men
should
*NL*
wait
on
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
shook
her
head
as
she
listened
.
``
My
darling
,
it
's
your
illness
*NL*
makes
you
talk
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
darling
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
there
must
be
servants
and
masters
,
but
*NL*
if
so
I
will
be
the
servant
of
my
servants
,
the
same
as
they
are
to
me
.
*NL*
And
another
thing
,
mother
,
every
one
of
us
has
sinned
against
all
men
,
and
*NL*
I
more
than
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
positively
smiled
at
that
,
smiled
through
her
tears
.
``
Why
,
how
*NL*
could
you
have
sinned
against
all
men
,
more
than
all
?
Robbers
and
*NL*
murderers
have
done
that
,
but
what
sin
have
you
committed
yet
,
that
you
*NL*
hold
yourself
more
guilty
than
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
little
heart
of
mine
,
''
he
said
-LRB-
he
had
begun
using
such
strange
*NL*
caressing
words
at
that
time
-RRB-
,
``
little
heart
of
mine
,
my
joy
,
believe
me
,
*NL*
every
one
is
really
responsible
to
all
men
for
all
men
and
for
everything
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
,
but
I
feel
it
is
so
,
painfully
*NL*
even
.
And
how
is
it
we
went
on
then
living
,
getting
angry
and
not
*NL*
knowing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
would
get
up
every
day
,
more
and
more
sweet
and
joyous
and
full
of
*NL*
love
.
When
the
doctor
,
an
old
German
called
Eisenschmidt
,
came
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
doctor
,
have
I
another
day
in
this
world
?
''
he
would
ask
,
joking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
live
many
days
yet
,
''
the
doctor
would
answer
,
``
and
months
and
*NL*
years
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Months
and
years
!
''
he
would
exclaim
.
``
Why
reckon
the
days
?
One
day
is
*NL*
enough
for
a
man
to
know
all
happiness
.
My
dear
ones
,
why
do
we
quarrel
,
*NL*
try
to
outshine
each
other
and
keep
grudges
against
each
other
?
Let
's
go
*NL*
straight
into
the
garden
,
walk
and
play
there
,
love
,
appreciate
,
and
kiss
*NL*
each
other
,
and
glorify
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
son
can
not
last
long
,
''
the
doctor
told
my
mother
,
as
she
accompanied
*NL*
him
to
the
door
.
``
The
disease
is
affecting
his
brain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
windows
of
his
room
looked
out
into
the
garden
,
and
our
garden
was
a
*NL*
shady
one
,
with
old
trees
in
it
which
were
coming
into
bud
.
The
first
*NL*
birds
of
spring
were
flitting
in
the
branches
,
chirruping
and
singing
at
*NL*
the
windows
.
And
looking
at
them
and
admiring
them
,
he
began
suddenly
*NL*
begging
their
forgiveness
too
:
``
Birds
of
heaven
,
happy
birds
,
forgive
me
,
*NL*
for
I
have
sinned
against
you
too
.
''
None
of
us
could
understand
that
at
*NL*
the
time
,
but
he
shed
tears
of
joy
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
was
such
a
*NL*
glory
of
God
all
about
me
:
birds
,
trees
,
meadows
,
sky
;
only
I
lived
in
*NL*
shame
and
dishonored
it
all
and
did
not
notice
the
beauty
and
glory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
too
many
sins
on
yourself
,
''
mother
used
to
say
,
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
darling
,
it
's
for
joy
,
not
for
grief
I
am
crying
.
Though
I
ca
n't
*NL*
explain
it
to
you
,
I
like
to
humble
myself
before
them
,
for
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
to
love
them
enough
.
If
I
have
sinned
against
every
one
,
yet
all
*NL*
forgive
me
,
too
,
and
that
's
heaven
.
Am
I
not
in
heaven
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
a
great
deal
more
I
do
n't
remember
.
I
remember
I
went
once
*NL*
into
his
room
when
there
was
no
one
else
there
.
It
was
a
bright
evening
,
*NL*
the
sun
was
setting
,
and
the
whole
room
was
lighted
up
.
He
beckoned
me
,
*NL*
and
I
went
up
to
him
.
He
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
into
my
*NL*
face
tenderly
,
lovingly
;
he
said
nothing
for
a
minute
,
only
looked
at
me
*NL*
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
run
and
play
now
,
enjoy
life
for
me
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
out
then
and
ran
to
play
.
And
many
times
in
my
life
afterwards
I
*NL*
remembered
even
with
tears
how
he
told
me
to
enjoy
life
for
him
too
.
There
*NL*
were
many
other
marvelous
and
beautiful
sayings
of
his
,
though
we
did
not
*NL*
understand
them
at
the
time
.
He
died
the
third
week
after
Easter
.
He
was
*NL*
fully
conscious
though
he
could
not
talk
;
up
to
his
last
hour
he
did
not
*NL*
change
.
He
looked
happy
,
his
eyes
beamed
and
sought
us
,
he
smiled
at
us
,
*NL*
beckoned
us
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
even
in
the
town
about
his
*NL*
death
.
I
was
impressed
by
all
this
at
the
time
,
but
not
too
much
so
,
*NL*
though
I
cried
a
good
deal
at
his
funeral
.
I
was
young
then
,
a
child
,
but
*NL*
a
lasting
impression
,
a
hidden
feeling
of
it
all
,
remained
in
my
heart
,
*NL*
ready
to
rise
up
and
respond
when
the
time
came
.
So
indeed
it
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
-LRB-
b
-RRB-
Of
the
Holy
Scriptures
in
the
Life
of
Father
Zossima
_
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
left
alone
with
my
mother
.
Her
friends
began
advising
her
to
send
me
*NL*
to
Petersburg
as
other
parents
did
.
``
You
have
only
one
son
now
,
''
they
*NL*
said
,
``
and
have
a
fair
income
,
and
you
will
be
depriving
him
perhaps
of
a
*NL*
brilliant
career
if
you
keep
him
here
.
''
They
suggested
I
should
be
sent
to
*NL*
Petersburg
to
the
Cadet
Corps
,
that
I
might
afterwards
enter
the
Imperial
*NL*
Guard
.
My
mother
hesitated
for
a
long
time
,
it
was
awful
to
part
with
her
*NL*
only
child
,
but
she
made
up
her
mind
to
it
at
last
,
though
not
without
*NL*
many
tears
,
believing
she
was
acting
for
my
happiness
.
She
brought
me
to
*NL*
Petersburg
and
put
me
into
the
Cadet
Corps
,
and
I
never
saw
her
again
.
For
*NL*
she
too
died
three
years
afterwards
.
She
spent
those
three
years
mourning
*NL*
and
grieving
for
both
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
house
of
my
childhood
I
have
brought
nothing
but
precious
*NL*
memories
,
for
there
are
no
memories
more
precious
than
those
of
early
*NL*
childhood
in
one
's
first
home
.
And
that
is
almost
always
so
if
there
is
*NL*
any
love
and
harmony
in
the
family
at
all
.
Indeed
,
precious
memories
may
*NL*
remain
even
of
a
bad
home
,
if
only
the
heart
knows
how
to
find
what
is
*NL*
precious
.
With
my
memories
of
home
I
count
,
too
,
my
memories
of
the
Bible
,
*NL*
which
,
child
as
I
was
,
I
was
very
eager
to
read
at
home
.
I
had
a
book
of
*NL*
Scripture
history
then
with
excellent
pictures
,
called
_
A
Hundred
and
Four
*NL*
Stories
from
the
Old
and
New
Testament
_
,
and
I
learned
to
read
from
it
.
I
*NL*
have
it
lying
on
my
shelf
now
,
I
keep
it
as
a
precious
relic
of
the
past
.
*NL*
But
even
before
I
learned
to
read
,
I
remember
first
being
moved
to
*NL*
devotional
feeling
at
eight
years
old
.
My
mother
took
me
alone
to
mass
-LRB-
I
*NL*
do
n't
remember
where
my
brother
was
at
the
time
-RRB-
on
the
Monday
before
*NL*
Easter
.
It
was
a
fine
day
,
and
I
remember
to-day
,
as
though
I
saw
it
now
,
*NL*
how
the
incense
rose
from
the
censer
and
softly
floated
upwards
and
,
*NL*
overhead
in
the
cupola
,
mingled
in
rising
waves
with
the
sunlight
that
*NL*
streamed
in
at
the
little
window
.
I
was
stirred
by
the
sight
,
and
for
the
*NL*
first
time
in
my
life
I
consciously
received
the
seed
of
God
's
word
in
my
*NL*
heart
.
A
youth
came
out
into
the
middle
of
the
church
carrying
a
big
book
,
*NL*
so
large
that
at
the
time
I
fancied
he
could
scarcely
carry
it
.
He
laid
it
*NL*
on
the
reading
desk
,
opened
it
,
and
began
reading
,
and
suddenly
for
the
*NL*
first
time
I
understood
something
read
in
the
church
of
God
.
In
the
land
*NL*
of
Uz
,
there
lived
a
man
,
righteous
and
God-fearing
,
and
he
had
great
*NL*
wealth
,
so
many
camels
,
so
many
sheep
and
asses
,
and
his
children
feasted
,
*NL*
and
he
loved
them
very
much
and
prayed
for
them
.
``
It
may
be
that
my
sons
*NL*
have
sinned
in
their
feasting
.
''
Now
the
devil
came
before
the
Lord
*NL*
together
with
the
sons
of
God
,
and
said
to
the
Lord
that
he
had
gone
up
*NL*
and
down
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
.
``
And
hast
thou
considered
my
*NL*
servant
Job
?
''
God
asked
of
him
.
And
God
boasted
to
the
devil
,
pointing
to
*NL*
his
great
and
holy
servant
.
And
the
devil
laughed
at
God
's
words
.
``
Give
*NL*
him
over
to
me
and
Thou
wilt
see
that
Thy
servant
will
murmur
against
Thee
*NL*
and
curse
Thy
name
.
''
And
God
gave
up
the
just
man
He
loved
so
,
to
the
*NL*
devil
.
And
the
devil
smote
his
children
and
his
cattle
and
scattered
his
*NL*
wealth
,
all
of
a
sudden
like
a
thunderbolt
from
heaven
.
And
Job
rent
his
*NL*
mantle
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
cried
aloud
,
``
Naked
came
I
out
of
*NL*
my
mother
's
womb
,
and
naked
shall
I
return
into
the
earth
;
the
Lord
gave
*NL*
and
the
Lord
has
taken
away
.
Blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Lord
for
ever
and
*NL*
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fathers
and
teachers
,
forgive
my
tears
now
,
for
all
my
childhood
rises
up
*NL*
again
before
me
,
and
I
breathe
now
as
I
breathed
then
,
with
the
breast
of
*NL*
a
little
child
of
eight
,
and
I
feel
as
I
did
then
,
awe
and
wonder
and
*NL*
gladness
.
The
camels
at
that
time
caught
my
imagination
,
and
Satan
,
who
*NL*
talked
like
that
with
God
,
and
God
who
gave
His
servant
up
to
destruction
,
*NL*
and
His
servant
crying
out
:
``
Blessed
be
Thy
name
although
Thou
dost
punish
*NL*
me
,
''
and
then
the
soft
and
sweet
singing
in
the
church
:
``
Let
my
prayer
*NL*
rise
up
before
Thee
,
''
and
again
incense
from
the
priest
's
censer
and
the
*NL*
kneeling
and
the
prayer
.
Ever
since
then
--
only
yesterday
I
took
it
up
--
I
've
*NL*
never
been
able
to
read
that
sacred
tale
without
tears
.
And
how
much
that
*NL*
is
great
,
mysterious
and
unfathomable
there
is
in
it
!
Afterwards
I
heard
*NL*
the
words
of
mockery
and
blame
,
proud
words
,
``
How
could
God
give
up
the
*NL*
most
loved
of
His
saints
for
the
diversion
of
the
devil
,
take
from
him
his
*NL*
children
,
smite
him
with
sore
boils
so
that
he
cleansed
the
corruption
*NL*
from
his
sores
with
a
pot-sherd
--
and
for
no
object
except
to
boast
to
the
*NL*
devil
!
`
See
what
My
saint
can
suffer
for
My
sake
.
'
''
But
the
greatness
of
*NL*
it
lies
just
in
the
fact
that
it
is
a
mystery
--
that
the
passing
earthly
*NL*
show
and
the
eternal
verity
are
brought
together
in
it
.
In
the
face
of
the
*NL*
earthly
truth
,
the
eternal
truth
is
accomplished
.
The
Creator
,
just
as
on
*NL*
the
first
days
of
creation
He
ended
each
day
with
praise
:
``
That
is
good
*NL*
that
I
have
created
,
''
looks
upon
Job
and
again
praises
His
creation
.
And
*NL*
Job
,
praising
the
Lord
,
serves
not
only
Him
but
all
His
creation
for
*NL*
generations
and
generations
,
and
for
ever
and
ever
,
since
for
that
he
was
*NL*
ordained
.
Good
heavens
,
what
a
book
it
is
,
and
what
lessons
there
are
in
*NL*
it
!
What
a
book
the
Bible
is
,
what
a
miracle
,
what
strength
is
given
with
*NL*
it
to
man
!
It
is
like
a
mold
cast
of
the
world
and
man
and
human
nature
,
*NL*
everything
is
there
,
and
a
law
for
everything
for
all
the
ages
.
And
what
*NL*
mysteries
are
solved
and
revealed
!
God
raises
Job
again
,
gives
him
wealth
*NL*
again
.
Many
years
pass
by
,
and
he
has
other
children
and
loves
them
.
But
*NL*
how
could
he
love
those
new
ones
when
those
first
children
are
no
more
,
*NL*
when
he
has
lost
them
?
Remembering
them
,
how
could
he
be
fully
happy
with
*NL*
those
new
ones
,
however
dear
the
new
ones
might
be
?
But
he
could
,
he
*NL*
could
.
It
's
the
great
mystery
of
human
life
that
old
grief
passes
*NL*
gradually
into
quiet
,
tender
joy
.
The
mild
serenity
of
age
takes
the
place
*NL*
of
the
riotous
blood
of
youth
.
I
bless
the
rising
sun
each
day
,
and
,
as
*NL*
before
,
my
hearts
sings
to
meet
it
,
but
now
I
love
even
more
its
setting
,
*NL*
its
long
slanting
rays
and
the
soft
,
tender
,
gentle
memories
that
come
*NL*
with
them
,
the
dear
images
from
the
whole
of
my
long
,
happy
life
--
and
over
*NL*
all
the
Divine
Truth
,
softening
,
reconciling
,
forgiving
!
My
life
is
*NL*
ending
,
I
know
that
well
,
but
every
day
that
is
left
me
I
feel
how
my
*NL*
earthly
life
is
in
touch
with
a
new
infinite
,
unknown
,
that
approaching
*NL*
life
,
the
nearness
of
which
sets
my
soul
quivering
with
rapture
,
my
mind
*NL*
glowing
and
my
heart
weeping
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friends
and
teachers
,
I
have
heard
more
than
once
,
and
of
late
one
may
*NL*
hear
it
more
often
,
that
the
priests
,
and
above
all
the
village
priests
,
*NL*
are
complaining
on
all
sides
of
their
miserable
income
and
their
*NL*
humiliating
lot
.
They
plainly
state
,
even
in
print
--
I
've
read
it
*NL*
myself
--
that
they
are
unable
to
teach
the
Scriptures
to
the
people
because
*NL*
of
the
smallness
of
their
means
,
and
if
Lutherans
and
heretics
come
and
*NL*
lead
the
flock
astray
,
they
let
them
lead
them
astray
because
they
have
so
*NL*
little
to
live
upon
.
May
the
Lord
increase
the
sustenance
that
is
so
*NL*
precious
to
them
,
for
their
complaint
is
just
,
too
.
But
of
a
truth
I
say
,
*NL*
if
any
one
is
to
blame
in
the
matter
,
half
the
fault
is
ours
.
For
he
may
*NL*
be
short
of
time
,
he
may
say
truly
that
he
is
overwhelmed
all
the
while
*NL*
with
work
and
services
,
but
still
it
's
not
all
the
time
,
even
he
has
an
*NL*
hour
a
week
to
remember
God
.
And
he
does
not
work
the
whole
year
round
.
*NL*
Let
him
gather
round
him
once
a
week
,
some
hour
in
the
evening
,
if
only
*NL*
the
children
at
first
--
the
fathers
will
hear
of
it
and
they
too
will
begin
*NL*
to
come
.
There
's
no
need
to
build
halls
for
this
,
let
him
take
them
into
*NL*
his
own
cottage
.
They
wo
n't
spoil
his
cottage
,
they
would
only
be
there
*NL*
one
hour
.
Let
him
open
that
book
and
begin
reading
it
without
grand
words
*NL*
or
superciliousness
,
without
condescension
to
them
,
but
gently
and
kindly
,
*NL*
being
glad
that
he
is
reading
to
them
and
that
they
are
listening
with
*NL*
attention
,
loving
the
words
himself
,
only
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
*NL*
explain
words
that
are
not
understood
by
the
peasants
.
Do
n't
be
anxious
,
*NL*
they
will
understand
everything
,
the
orthodox
heart
will
understand
all
!
*NL*
Let
him
read
them
about
Abraham
and
Sarah
,
about
Isaac
and
Rebecca
,
of
how
*NL*
Jacob
went
to
Laban
and
wrestled
with
the
Lord
in
his
dream
and
said
,
*NL*
``
This
place
is
holy
''
--
and
he
will
impress
the
devout
mind
of
the
peasant
.
*NL*
Let
him
read
,
especially
to
the
children
,
how
the
brothers
sold
Joseph
,
*NL*
the
tender
boy
,
the
dreamer
and
prophet
,
into
bondage
,
and
told
their
*NL*
father
that
a
wild
beast
had
devoured
him
,
and
showed
him
his
blood
-
*NL*
stained
clothes
.
Let
him
read
them
how
the
brothers
afterwards
journeyed
*NL*
into
Egypt
for
corn
,
and
Joseph
,
already
a
great
ruler
,
unrecognized
by
*NL*
them
,
tormented
them
,
accused
them
,
kept
his
brother
Benjamin
,
and
all
*NL*
through
love
:
``
I
love
you
,
and
loving
you
I
torment
you
.
''
For
he
*NL*
remembered
all
his
life
how
they
had
sold
him
to
the
merchants
in
the
*NL*
burning
desert
by
the
well
,
and
how
,
wringing
his
hands
,
he
had
wept
and
*NL*
besought
his
brothers
not
to
sell
him
as
a
slave
in
a
strange
land
.
And
*NL*
how
,
seeing
them
again
after
many
years
,
he
loved
them
beyond
measure
,
but
*NL*
he
harassed
and
tormented
them
in
love
.
He
left
them
at
last
not
able
to
*NL*
bear
the
suffering
of
his
heart
,
flung
himself
on
his
bed
and
wept
.
Then
,
*NL*
wiping
his
tears
away
,
he
went
out
to
them
joyful
and
told
them
,
*NL*
``
Brothers
,
I
am
your
brother
Joseph
!
''
Let
him
read
them
further
how
happy
*NL*
old
Jacob
was
on
learning
that
his
darling
boy
was
still
alive
,
and
how
he
*NL*
went
to
Egypt
leaving
his
own
country
,
and
died
in
a
foreign
land
,
*NL*
bequeathing
his
great
prophecy
that
had
lain
mysteriously
hidden
in
his
*NL*
meek
and
timid
heart
all
his
life
,
that
from
his
offspring
,
from
Judah
,
*NL*
will
come
the
great
hope
of
the
world
,
the
Messiah
and
Saviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fathers
and
teachers
,
forgive
me
and
do
n't
be
angry
,
that
like
a
little
*NL*
child
I
've
been
babbling
of
what
you
know
long
ago
,
and
can
teach
me
a
*NL*
hundred
times
more
skillfully
.
I
only
speak
from
rapture
,
and
forgive
my
*NL*
tears
,
for
I
love
the
Bible
.
Let
him
too
weep
,
the
priest
of
God
,
and
be
*NL*
sure
that
the
hearts
of
his
listeners
will
throb
in
response
.
Only
a
*NL*
little
tiny
seed
is
needed
--
drop
it
into
the
heart
of
the
peasant
and
it
*NL*
wo
n't
die
,
it
will
live
in
his
soul
all
his
life
,
it
will
be
hidden
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
his
darkness
and
sin
,
like
a
bright
spot
,
like
a
great
reminder
.
*NL*
And
there
's
no
need
of
much
teaching
or
explanation
,
he
will
understand
it
*NL*
all
simply
.
Do
you
suppose
that
the
peasants
do
n't
understand
?
Try
reading
*NL*
them
the
touching
story
of
the
fair
Esther
and
the
haughty
Vashti
;
or
the
*NL*
miraculous
story
of
Jonah
in
the
whale
.
Do
n't
forget
either
the
parables
*NL*
of
Our
Lord
,
choose
especially
from
the
Gospel
of
St.
Luke
-LRB-
that
is
what
I
*NL*
did
-RRB-
,
and
then
from
the
Acts
of
the
Apostles
the
conversion
of
St.
Paul
*NL*
-LRB-
that
you
must
n't
leave
out
on
any
account
-RRB-
,
and
from
the
_
Lives
of
the
*NL*
Saints
_
,
for
instance
,
the
life
of
Alexey
,
the
man
of
God
and
,
greatest
of
*NL*
all
,
the
happy
martyr
and
the
seer
of
God
,
Mary
of
Egypt
--
and
you
will
*NL*
penetrate
their
hearts
with
these
simple
tales
.
Give
one
hour
a
week
to
it
*NL*
in
spite
of
your
poverty
,
only
one
little
hour
.
And
you
will
see
for
*NL*
yourselves
that
our
people
is
gracious
and
grateful
,
and
will
repay
you
a
*NL*
hundred-fold
.
Mindful
of
the
kindness
of
their
priest
and
the
moving
words
*NL*
they
have
heard
from
him
,
they
will
of
their
own
accord
help
him
in
his
*NL*
fields
and
in
his
house
,
and
will
treat
him
with
more
respect
than
*NL*
before
--
so
that
it
will
even
increase
his
worldly
well-being
too
.
The
thing
*NL*
is
so
simple
that
sometimes
one
is
even
afraid
to
put
it
into
words
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
being
laughed
at
,
and
yet
how
true
it
is
!
One
who
does
not
believe
*NL*
in
God
will
not
believe
in
God
's
people
.
He
who
believes
in
God
's
people
*NL*
will
see
His
Holiness
too
,
even
though
he
had
not
believed
in
it
till
*NL*
then
.
Only
the
people
and
their
future
spiritual
power
will
convert
our
*NL*
atheists
,
who
have
torn
themselves
away
from
their
native
soil
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
is
the
use
of
Christ
's
words
,
unless
we
set
an
example
?
The
*NL*
people
is
lost
without
the
Word
of
God
,
for
its
soul
is
athirst
for
the
*NL*
Word
and
for
all
that
is
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
youth
,
long
ago
,
nearly
forty
years
ago
,
I
traveled
all
over
Russia
*NL*
with
Father
Anfim
,
collecting
funds
for
our
monastery
,
and
we
stayed
one
*NL*
night
on
the
bank
of
a
great
navigable
river
with
some
fishermen
.
A
good
-
*NL*
looking
peasant
lad
,
about
eighteen
,
joined
us
;
he
had
to
hurry
back
next
*NL*
morning
to
pull
a
merchant
's
barge
along
the
bank
.
I
noticed
him
looking
*NL*
straight
before
him
with
clear
and
tender
eyes
.
It
was
a
bright
,
warm
,
*NL*
still
,
July
night
,
a
cool
mist
rose
from
the
broad
river
,
we
could
hear
*NL*
the
plash
of
a
fish
,
the
birds
were
still
,
all
was
hushed
and
beautiful
,
*NL*
everything
praying
to
God
.
Only
we
two
were
not
sleeping
,
the
lad
and
I
,
*NL*
and
we
talked
of
the
beauty
of
this
world
of
God
's
and
of
the
great
*NL*
mystery
of
it
.
Every
blade
of
grass
,
every
insect
,
ant
,
and
golden
bee
,
*NL*
all
so
marvelously
know
their
path
,
though
they
have
not
intelligence
,
*NL*
they
bear
witness
to
the
mystery
of
God
and
continually
accomplish
it
*NL*
themselves
.
I
saw
the
dear
lad
's
heart
was
moved
.
He
told
me
that
he
loved
*NL*
the
forest
and
the
forest
birds
.
He
was
a
bird-catcher
,
knew
the
note
of
*NL*
each
of
them
,
could
call
each
bird
.
``
I
know
nothing
better
than
to
be
in
*NL*
the
forest
,
''
said
he
,
``
though
all
things
are
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
''
I
answered
him
,
``
all
things
are
good
and
fair
,
because
all
is
*NL*
truth
.
Look
,
''
said
I
,
``
at
the
horse
,
that
great
beast
that
is
so
near
to
*NL*
man
;
or
the
lowly
,
pensive
ox
,
which
feeds
him
and
works
for
him
;
look
at
*NL*
their
faces
,
what
meekness
,
what
devotion
to
man
,
who
often
beats
them
*NL*
mercilessly
.
What
gentleness
,
what
confidence
and
what
beauty
!
It
's
*NL*
touching
to
know
that
there
's
no
sin
in
them
,
for
all
,
all
except
man
,
is
*NL*
sinless
,
and
Christ
has
been
with
them
before
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
asked
the
boy
,
``
is
Christ
with
them
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
but
be
so
,
''
said
I
,
``
since
the
Word
is
for
all
.
All
creation
*NL*
and
all
creatures
,
every
leaf
is
striving
to
the
Word
,
singing
glory
to
*NL*
God
,
weeping
to
Christ
,
unconsciously
accomplishing
this
by
the
mystery
of
*NL*
their
sinless
life
.
Yonder
,
''
said
I
,
``
in
the
forest
wanders
the
dreadful
*NL*
bear
,
fierce
and
menacing
,
and
yet
innocent
in
it
.
''
And
I
told
him
how
*NL*
once
a
bear
came
to
a
great
saint
who
had
taken
refuge
in
a
tiny
cell
in
*NL*
the
wood
.
And
the
great
saint
pitied
him
,
went
up
to
him
without
fear
and
*NL*
gave
him
a
piece
of
bread
.
``
Go
along
,
''
said
he
,
``
Christ
be
with
you
,
''
and
*NL*
the
savage
beast
walked
away
meekly
and
obediently
,
doing
no
harm
.
And
the
*NL*
lad
was
delighted
that
the
bear
had
walked
away
without
hurting
the
saint
,
*NL*
and
that
Christ
was
with
him
too
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
good
that
is
,
how
*NL*
good
and
beautiful
is
all
God
's
work
!
''
He
sat
musing
softly
and
sweetly
.
I
*NL*
saw
he
understood
.
And
he
slept
beside
me
a
light
and
sinless
sleep
.
May
*NL*
God
bless
youth
!
And
I
prayed
for
him
as
I
went
to
sleep
.
Lord
,
send
peace
*NL*
and
light
to
Thy
people
!

The

Recollections
of
Father
Zossima
's
Youth
before
he
became
a
Monk
.
The
*NL*
Duel
_
*NL*
*NL*
I
spent
a
long
time
,
almost
eight
years
,
in
the
military
cadet
school
at
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
in
the
novelty
of
my
surroundings
there
,
many
of
my
*NL*
childish
impressions
grew
dimmer
,
though
I
forgot
nothing
.
I
picked
up
so
*NL*
many
new
habits
and
opinions
that
I
was
transformed
into
a
cruel
,
absurd
,
*NL*
almost
savage
creature
.
A
surface
polish
of
courtesy
and
society
manners
I
*NL*
did
acquire
together
with
the
French
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
all
,
myself
included
,
looked
upon
the
soldiers
in
our
service
as
*NL*
cattle
.
I
was
perhaps
worse
than
the
rest
in
that
respect
,
for
I
was
so
*NL*
much
more
impressionable
than
my
companions
.
By
the
time
we
left
the
*NL*
school
as
officers
,
we
were
ready
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
honor
of
*NL*
the
regiment
,
but
no
one
of
us
had
any
knowledge
of
the
real
meaning
of
*NL*
honor
,
and
if
any
one
had
known
it
,
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
*NL*
ridicule
it
.
Drunkenness
,
debauchery
and
devilry
were
what
we
almost
*NL*
prided
ourselves
on
.
I
do
n't
say
that
we
were
bad
by
nature
,
all
these
*NL*
young
men
were
good
fellows
,
but
they
behaved
badly
,
and
I
worst
of
all
.
*NL*
What
made
it
worse
for
me
was
that
I
had
come
into
my
own
money
,
and
so
I
*NL*
flung
myself
into
a
life
of
pleasure
,
and
plunged
headlong
into
all
the
*NL*
recklessness
of
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
fond
of
reading
,
yet
strange
to
say
,
the
Bible
was
the
one
book
I
*NL*
never
opened
at
that
time
,
though
I
always
carried
it
about
with
me
,
and
I
*NL*
was
never
separated
from
it
;
in
very
truth
I
was
keeping
that
book
``
for
*NL*
the
day
and
the
hour
,
for
the
month
and
the
year
,
''
though
I
knew
it
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
four
years
of
this
life
,
I
chanced
to
be
in
the
town
of
K.
where
our
*NL*
regiment
was
stationed
at
the
time
.
We
found
the
people
of
the
town
*NL*
hospitable
,
rich
and
fond
of
entertainments
.
I
met
with
a
cordial
*NL*
reception
everywhere
,
as
I
was
of
a
lively
temperament
and
was
known
to
be
*NL*
well
off
,
which
always
goes
a
long
way
in
the
world
.
And
then
a
*NL*
circumstance
happened
which
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
formed
an
attachment
to
a
beautiful
and
intelligent
young
girl
of
noble
*NL*
and
lofty
character
,
the
daughter
of
people
much
respected
.
They
were
*NL*
well-to-do
people
of
influence
and
position
.
They
always
gave
me
a
cordial
*NL*
and
friendly
reception
.
I
fancied
that
the
young
lady
looked
on
me
with
*NL*
favor
and
my
heart
was
aflame
at
such
an
idea
.
Later
on
I
saw
and
fully
*NL*
realized
that
I
perhaps
was
not
so
passionately
in
love
with
her
at
all
,
*NL*
but
only
recognized
the
elevation
of
her
mind
and
character
,
which
I
could
*NL*
not
indeed
have
helped
doing
.
I
was
prevented
,
however
,
from
making
her
an
*NL*
offer
at
the
time
by
my
selfishness
,
I
was
loath
to
part
with
the
*NL*
allurements
of
my
free
and
licentious
bachelor
life
in
the
heyday
of
my
*NL*
youth
,
and
with
my
pockets
full
of
money
.
I
did
drop
some
hint
as
to
my
*NL*
feelings
however
,
though
I
put
off
taking
any
decisive
step
for
a
time
.
*NL*
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
we
were
ordered
off
for
two
months
to
another
*NL*
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
return
two
months
later
,
I
found
the
young
lady
already
married
to
a
*NL*
rich
neighboring
landowner
,
a
very
amiable
man
,
still
young
though
older
*NL*
than
I
was
,
connected
with
the
best
Petersburg
society
,
which
I
was
not
,
*NL*
and
of
excellent
education
,
which
I
also
was
not
.
I
was
so
overwhelmed
at
*NL*
this
unexpected
circumstance
that
my
mind
was
positively
clouded
.
The
*NL*
worst
of
it
all
was
that
,
as
I
learned
then
,
the
young
landowner
had
been
*NL*
a
long
while
betrothed
to
her
,
and
I
had
met
him
indeed
many
times
in
her
*NL*
house
,
but
blinded
by
my
conceit
I
had
noticed
nothing
.
And
this
*NL*
particularly
mortified
me
;
almost
everybody
had
known
all
about
it
,
while
*NL*
I
knew
nothing
.
I
was
filled
with
sudden
irrepressible
fury
.
With
flushed
*NL*
face
I
began
recalling
how
often
I
had
been
on
the
point
of
declaring
my
*NL*
love
to
her
,
and
as
she
had
not
attempted
to
stop
me
or
to
warn
me
,
she
*NL*
must
,
I
concluded
,
have
been
laughing
at
me
all
the
time
.
Later
on
,
of
*NL*
course
,
I
reflected
and
remembered
that
she
had
been
very
far
from
*NL*
laughing
at
me
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
used
to
turn
off
any
love-making
on
*NL*
my
part
with
a
jest
and
begin
talking
of
other
subjects
;
but
at
that
*NL*
moment
I
was
incapable
of
reflecting
and
was
all
eagerness
for
revenge
.
I
*NL*
am
surprised
to
remember
that
my
wrath
and
revengeful
feelings
were
*NL*
extremely
repugnant
to
my
own
nature
,
for
being
of
an
easy
temper
,
I
found
*NL*
it
difficult
to
be
angry
with
any
one
for
long
,
and
so
I
had
to
work
*NL*
myself
up
artificially
and
became
at
last
revolting
and
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
for
an
opportunity
and
succeeded
in
insulting
my
``
rival
''
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
a
large
company
.
I
insulted
him
on
a
perfectly
extraneous
*NL*
pretext
,
jeering
at
his
opinion
upon
an
important
public
event
--
it
was
in
*NL*
the
year
1826
-LRB-
5
-RRB-
--
and
my
jeer
was
,
so
people
said
,
clever
and
effective
.
*NL*
Then
I
forced
him
to
ask
for
an
explanation
,
and
behaved
so
rudely
that
he
*NL*
accepted
my
challenge
in
spite
of
the
vast
inequality
between
us
,
as
I
was
*NL*
younger
,
a
person
of
no
consequence
,
and
of
inferior
rank
.
I
learned
*NL*
afterwards
for
a
fact
that
it
was
from
a
jealous
feeling
on
his
side
also
*NL*
that
my
challenge
was
accepted
;
he
had
been
rather
jealous
of
me
on
his
*NL*
wife
's
account
before
their
marriage
;
he
fancied
now
that
if
he
submitted
*NL*
to
be
insulted
by
me
and
refused
to
accept
my
challenge
,
and
if
she
heard
*NL*
of
it
,
she
might
begin
to
despise
him
and
waver
in
her
love
for
him
.
I
*NL*
soon
found
a
second
in
a
comrade
,
an
ensign
of
our
regiment
.
In
those
days
*NL*
though
duels
were
severely
punished
,
yet
dueling
was
a
kind
of
fashion
*NL*
among
the
officers
--
so
strong
and
deeply
rooted
will
a
brutal
prejudice
*NL*
sometimes
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
end
of
June
,
and
our
meeting
was
to
take
place
at
seven
o'clock
*NL*
the
next
day
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
--
and
then
something
happened
that
*NL*
in
very
truth
was
the
turning-point
of
my
life
.
In
the
evening
,
returning
*NL*
home
in
a
savage
and
brutal
humor
,
I
flew
into
a
rage
with
my
orderly
*NL*
Afanasy
,
and
gave
him
two
blows
in
the
face
with
all
my
might
,
so
that
it
*NL*
was
covered
with
blood
.
He
had
not
long
been
in
my
service
and
I
had
*NL*
struck
him
before
,
but
never
with
such
ferocious
cruelty
.
And
,
believe
me
,
*NL*
though
it
's
forty
years
ago
,
I
recall
it
now
with
shame
and
pain
.
I
went
*NL*
to
bed
and
slept
for
about
three
hours
;
when
I
waked
up
the
day
was
*NL*
breaking
.
I
got
up
--
I
did
not
want
to
sleep
any
more
--
I
went
to
the
*NL*
window
--
opened
it
,
it
looked
out
upon
the
garden
;
I
saw
the
sun
rising
;
it
*NL*
was
warm
and
beautiful
,
the
birds
were
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
meaning
of
it
?
''
I
thought
.
``
I
feel
in
my
heart
as
it
were
*NL*
something
vile
and
shameful
.
Is
it
because
I
am
going
to
shed
blood
?
No
,
''
*NL*
I
thought
,
``
I
feel
it
's
not
that
.
Can
it
be
that
I
am
afraid
of
death
,
*NL*
afraid
of
being
killed
?
No
,
that
's
not
it
,
that
's
not
it
at
all
.
''
...
And
*NL*
all
at
once
I
knew
what
it
was
:
it
was
because
I
had
beaten
Afanasy
the
*NL*
evening
before
!
It
all
rose
before
my
mind
,
it
all
was
as
it
were
repeated
*NL*
over
again
;
he
stood
before
me
and
I
was
beating
him
straight
on
the
face
*NL*
and
he
was
holding
his
arms
stiffly
down
,
his
head
erect
,
his
eyes
fixed
*NL*
upon
me
as
though
on
parade
.
He
staggered
at
every
blow
and
did
not
even
*NL*
dare
to
raise
his
hands
to
protect
himself
.
That
is
what
a
man
has
been
*NL*
brought
to
,
and
that
was
a
man
beating
a
fellow
creature
!
What
a
crime
!
It
*NL*
was
as
though
a
sharp
dagger
had
pierced
me
right
through
.
I
stood
as
if
I
*NL*
were
struck
dumb
,
while
the
sun
was
shining
,
the
leaves
were
rejoicing
and
*NL*
the
birds
were
trilling
the
praise
of
God
...
I
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
,
*NL*
fell
on
my
bed
and
broke
into
a
storm
of
tears
.
And
then
I
remembered
my
*NL*
brother
Markel
and
what
he
said
on
his
death-bed
to
his
servants
:
``
My
dear
*NL*
ones
,
why
do
you
wait
on
me
,
why
do
you
love
me
,
am
I
worth
your
waiting
*NL*
on
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
am
I
worth
it
?
''
flashed
through
my
mind
.
``
After
all
what
am
I
worth
,
*NL*
that
another
man
,
a
fellow
creature
,
made
in
the
likeness
and
image
of
*NL*
God
,
should
serve
me
?
''
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
this
question
forced
*NL*
itself
upon
me
.
He
had
said
,
``
Mother
,
my
little
heart
,
in
truth
we
are
*NL*
each
responsible
to
all
for
all
,
it
's
only
that
men
do
n't
know
this
.
If
*NL*
they
knew
it
,
the
world
would
be
a
paradise
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
,
can
that
too
be
false
?
''
I
thought
as
I
wept
.
``
In
truth
,
perhaps
,
I
*NL*
am
more
than
all
others
responsible
for
all
,
a
greater
sinner
than
all
men
*NL*
in
the
world
.
''
And
all
at
once
the
whole
truth
in
its
full
light
appeared
*NL*
to
me
;
what
was
I
going
to
do
?
I
was
going
to
kill
a
good
,
clever
,
noble
*NL*
man
,
who
had
done
me
no
wrong
,
and
by
depriving
his
wife
of
happiness
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
her
life
,
I
should
be
torturing
and
killing
her
too
.
I
lay
*NL*
thus
in
my
bed
with
my
face
in
the
pillow
,
heedless
how
the
time
was
*NL*
passing
.
Suddenly
my
second
,
the
ensign
,
came
in
with
the
pistols
to
fetch
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
's
a
good
thing
you
are
up
already
,
it
's
time
we
were
*NL*
off
,
come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
hurried
to
and
fro
undecided
;
we
went
out
to
*NL*
the
carriage
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
here
a
minute
,
''
I
said
to
him
.
``
I
'll
be
back
directly
,
I
have
*NL*
forgotten
my
purse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
ran
back
alone
,
to
Afanasy
's
little
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afanasy
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
gave
you
two
blows
on
the
face
yesterday
,
forgive
*NL*
me
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
as
though
he
were
frightened
,
and
looked
at
me
;
and
I
saw
that
*NL*
it
was
not
enough
,
and
on
the
spot
,
in
my
full
officer
's
uniform
,
I
*NL*
dropped
at
his
feet
and
bowed
my
head
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
was
completely
aghast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
...
sir
,
what
are
you
doing
?
Am
I
worth
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
burst
out
crying
as
I
had
done
before
,
hid
this
face
in
his
hands
,
*NL*
turned
to
the
window
and
shook
all
over
with
his
sobs
.
I
flew
out
to
my
*NL*
comrade
and
jumped
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
,
''
I
cried
.
``
Have
you
ever
seen
a
conqueror
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Here
is
*NL*
one
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
ecstasy
,
laughing
and
talking
all
the
way
,
I
do
n't
remember
what
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
.
``
Well
,
brother
,
you
are
a
plucky
fellow
,
you
'll
keep
up
*NL*
the
honor
of
the
uniform
,
I
can
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
reached
the
place
and
found
them
there
,
waiting
us
.
We
were
placed
*NL*
twelve
paces
apart
;
he
had
the
first
shot
.
I
stood
gayly
,
looking
him
full
*NL*
in
the
face
;
I
did
not
twitch
an
eyelash
,
I
looked
lovingly
at
him
,
for
I
*NL*
knew
what
I
would
do
.
His
shot
just
grazed
my
cheek
and
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
''
I
cried
,
``
no
man
has
been
killed
,
''
and
I
seized
my
pistol
,
*NL*
turned
back
and
flung
it
far
away
into
the
wood
.
``
That
's
the
place
for
*NL*
you
,
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
to
my
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
young
fool
that
I
am
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
``
for
my
unprovoked
insult
*NL*
to
you
and
for
forcing
you
to
fire
at
me
.
I
am
ten
times
worse
than
you
*NL*
and
more
,
maybe
.
Tell
that
to
the
person
whom
you
hold
dearest
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
they
all
three
shouted
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
cried
my
adversary
,
annoyed
,
``
if
you
did
not
want
to
*NL*
fight
,
why
did
not
you
let
me
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
I
was
a
fool
,
to-day
I
know
better
,
''
I
answered
him
gayly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
yesterday
,
I
believe
you
,
but
as
for
to-day
,
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
agree
with
your
opinion
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
''
I
cried
,
clapping
my
hands
.
``
I
agree
with
you
there
too
.
I
have
*NL*
deserved
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
shoot
,
sir
,
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
I
said
;
``
if
you
like
,
fire
at
me
again
,
but
it
would
be
*NL*
better
for
you
not
to
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
seconds
,
especially
mine
,
were
shouting
too
:
``
Can
you
disgrace
the
*NL*
regiment
like
this
,
facing
your
antagonist
and
begging
his
forgiveness
!
If
*NL*
I
'd
only
known
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
facing
them
all
,
not
laughing
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
I
said
,
``
is
it
really
so
wonderful
in
these
days
to
find
a
*NL*
man
who
can
repent
of
his
stupidity
and
publicly
confess
his
wrongdoing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
in
a
duel
,
''
cried
my
second
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
's
so
strange
,
''
I
said
.
``
For
I
ought
to
have
owned
my
fault
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
got
here
,
before
he
had
fired
a
shot
,
before
leading
him
into
a
*NL*
great
and
deadly
sin
;
but
we
have
made
our
life
so
grotesque
,
that
to
act
*NL*
in
that
way
would
have
been
almost
impossible
,
for
only
after
I
have
faced
*NL*
his
shot
at
the
distance
of
twelve
paces
could
my
words
have
any
*NL*
significance
for
him
,
and
if
I
had
spoken
before
,
he
would
have
said
,
`
He
*NL*
is
a
coward
,
the
sight
of
the
pistols
has
frightened
him
,
no
use
to
listen
*NL*
to
him
.
'
Gentlemen
,
''
I
cried
suddenly
,
speaking
straight
from
my
heart
,
*NL*
``
look
around
you
at
the
gifts
of
God
,
the
clear
sky
,
the
pure
air
,
the
*NL*
tender
grass
,
the
birds
;
nature
is
beautiful
and
sinless
,
and
we
,
only
we
,
*NL*
are
sinful
and
foolish
,
and
we
do
n't
understand
that
life
is
heaven
,
for
*NL*
we
have
only
to
understand
that
and
it
will
at
once
be
fulfilled
in
all
*NL*
its
beauty
,
we
shall
embrace
each
other
and
weep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
said
more
but
I
could
not
;
my
voice
broke
with
the
sweetness
*NL*
and
youthful
gladness
of
it
,
and
there
was
such
bliss
in
my
heart
as
I
had
*NL*
never
known
before
in
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
as
rational
and
edifying
,
''
said
my
antagonist
,
``
and
in
any
case
*NL*
you
are
an
original
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
laugh
,
''
I
said
to
him
,
laughing
too
,
``
but
afterwards
you
will
*NL*
approve
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
ready
to
approve
of
you
now
,
''
said
he
;
``
will
you
shake
hands
?
*NL*
for
I
believe
you
are
genuinely
sincere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
``
not
now
,
later
on
when
I
have
grown
worthier
and
deserve
*NL*
your
esteem
,
then
shake
hands
and
you
will
do
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
home
,
my
second
upbraiding
me
all
the
way
,
while
I
kissed
him
.
All
*NL*
my
comrades
heard
of
the
affair
at
once
and
gathered
together
to
pass
*NL*
judgment
on
me
the
same
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
disgraced
the
uniform
,
''
they
said
;
``
let
him
resign
his
*NL*
commission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
stood
up
for
me
:
``
He
faced
the
shot
,
''
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
other
shot
and
begged
for
forgiveness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
had
been
afraid
of
being
shot
,
he
would
have
shot
his
own
pistol
*NL*
first
before
asking
forgiveness
,
while
he
flung
it
loaded
into
the
forest
.
*NL*
No
,
there
's
something
else
in
this
,
something
original
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
enjoyed
listening
and
looking
at
them
.
``
My
dear
friends
and
comrades
,
''
*NL*
said
I
,
``
do
n't
worry
about
my
resigning
my
commission
,
for
I
have
done
so
*NL*
already
.
I
have
sent
in
my
papers
this
morning
and
as
soon
as
I
get
my
*NL*
discharge
I
shall
go
into
a
monastery
--
it
's
with
that
object
I
am
leaving
*NL*
the
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
said
this
every
one
of
them
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
told
us
of
that
first
,
that
explains
everything
,
we
ca
n't
*NL*
judge
a
monk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
laughed
and
could
not
stop
themselves
,
and
not
scornfully
,
but
kindly
*NL*
and
merrily
.
They
all
felt
friendly
to
me
at
once
,
even
those
who
had
been
*NL*
sternest
in
their
censure
,
and
all
the
following
month
,
before
my
*NL*
discharge
came
,
they
could
not
make
enough
of
me
.
``
Ah
,
you
monk
,
''
they
*NL*
would
say
.
And
every
one
said
something
kind
to
me
,
they
began
trying
to
*NL*
dissuade
me
,
even
to
pity
me
:
``
What
are
you
doing
to
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
they
would
say
,
``
he
is
a
brave
fellow
,
he
faced
fire
and
could
have
*NL*
fired
his
own
pistol
too
,
but
he
had
a
dream
the
night
before
that
he
*NL*
should
become
a
monk
,
that
's
why
he
did
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
thing
with
the
society
of
the
town
.
Till
then
I
had
been
*NL*
kindly
received
,
but
had
not
been
the
object
of
special
attention
,
and
now
*NL*
all
came
to
know
me
at
once
and
invited
me
;
they
laughed
at
me
,
but
they
*NL*
loved
me
.
I
may
mention
that
although
everybody
talked
openly
of
our
duel
,
*NL*
the
authorities
took
no
notice
of
it
,
because
my
antagonist
was
a
near
*NL*
relation
of
our
general
,
and
as
there
had
been
no
bloodshed
and
no
serious
*NL*
consequences
,
and
as
I
resigned
my
commission
,
they
took
it
as
a
joke
.
And
*NL*
I
began
then
to
speak
aloud
and
fearlessly
,
regardless
of
their
laughter
,
*NL*
for
it
was
always
kindly
and
not
spiteful
laughter
.
These
conversations
*NL*
mostly
took
place
in
the
evenings
,
in
the
company
of
ladies
;
women
*NL*
particularly
liked
listening
to
me
then
and
they
made
the
men
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
I
possibly
be
responsible
for
all
?
''
every
one
would
laugh
in
*NL*
my
face
.
``
Can
I
,
for
instance
,
be
responsible
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
not
know
it
,
''
I
would
answer
,
``
since
the
whole
world
has
*NL*
long
been
going
on
a
different
line
,
since
we
consider
the
veriest
lies
as
*NL*
truth
and
demand
the
same
lies
from
others
.
Here
I
have
for
once
in
my
*NL*
life
acted
sincerely
and
,
well
,
you
all
look
upon
me
as
a
madman
.
Though
*NL*
you
are
friendly
to
me
,
yet
,
you
see
,
you
all
laugh
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
we
help
being
friendly
to
you
?
''
said
my
hostess
,
laughing
.
*NL*
The
room
was
full
of
people
.
All
of
a
sudden
the
young
lady
rose
,
on
whose
*NL*
account
the
duel
had
been
fought
and
whom
only
lately
I
had
intended
to
be
*NL*
my
future
wife
.
I
had
not
noticed
her
coming
into
the
room
.
She
got
up
,
*NL*
came
to
me
and
held
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
tell
you
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
I
am
the
first
not
to
laugh
at
you
,
but
*NL*
on
the
contrary
I
thank
you
with
tears
and
express
my
respect
for
you
for
*NL*
your
action
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
,
too
,
came
up
and
then
they
all
approached
me
and
almost
*NL*
kissed
me
.
My
heart
was
filled
with
joy
,
but
my
attention
was
especially
*NL*
caught
by
a
middle-aged
man
who
came
up
to
me
with
the
others
.
I
knew
him
*NL*
by
name
already
,
but
had
never
made
his
acquaintance
nor
exchanged
a
word
*NL*
with
him
till
that
evening
.

The
Mysterious
Visitor
_
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
long
been
an
official
in
the
town
;
he
was
in
a
prominent
position
,
*NL*
respected
by
all
,
rich
and
had
a
reputation
for
benevolence
.
He
subscribed
*NL*
considerable
sums
to
the
almshouse
and
the
orphan
asylum
;
he
was
very
*NL*
charitable
,
too
,
in
secret
,
a
fact
which
only
became
known
after
his
*NL*
death
.
He
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
,
almost
stern
in
appearance
and
not
*NL*
much
given
to
conversation
.
He
had
been
married
about
ten
years
and
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
was
still
young
,
had
borne
him
three
children
.
Well
,
I
was
*NL*
sitting
alone
in
my
room
the
following
evening
,
when
my
door
suddenly
*NL*
opened
and
this
gentleman
walked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
mention
,
by
the
way
,
that
I
was
no
longer
living
in
my
former
*NL*
quarters
.
As
soon
as
I
resigned
my
commission
,
I
took
rooms
with
an
old
*NL*
lady
,
the
widow
of
a
government
clerk
.
My
landlady
's
servant
waited
upon
*NL*
me
,
for
I
had
moved
into
her
rooms
simply
because
on
my
return
from
the
*NL*
duel
I
had
sent
Afanasy
back
to
the
regiment
,
as
I
felt
ashamed
to
look
*NL*
him
in
the
face
after
my
last
interview
with
him
.
So
prone
is
the
man
of
*NL*
the
world
to
be
ashamed
of
any
righteous
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
''
said
my
visitor
,
``
with
great
interest
listened
to
you
speaking
*NL*
in
different
houses
the
last
few
days
and
I
wanted
at
last
to
make
your
*NL*
personal
acquaintance
,
so
as
to
talk
to
you
more
intimately
.
Can
you
,
dear
*NL*
sir
,
grant
me
this
favor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
,
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
and
I
shall
look
upon
it
as
an
honor
.
''
*NL*
I
said
this
,
though
I
felt
almost
dismayed
,
so
greatly
was
I
impressed
*NL*
from
the
first
moment
by
the
appearance
of
this
man
.
For
though
other
*NL*
people
had
listened
to
me
with
interest
and
attention
,
no
one
had
come
to
*NL*
me
before
with
such
a
serious
,
stern
and
concentrated
expression
.
And
now
*NL*
he
had
come
to
see
me
in
my
own
rooms
.
He
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
I
see
,
a
man
of
great
strength
of
character
,
''
he
said
;
``
as
you
*NL*
have
dared
to
serve
the
truth
,
even
when
by
doing
so
you
risked
incurring
*NL*
the
contempt
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
praise
is
,
perhaps
,
excessive
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
excessive
,
''
he
answered
;
``
believe
me
,
such
a
course
of
*NL*
action
is
far
more
difficult
than
you
think
.
It
is
that
which
has
*NL*
impressed
me
,
and
it
is
only
on
that
account
that
I
have
come
to
you
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
.
``
Tell
me
,
please
,
that
is
if
you
are
not
annoyed
by
my
perhaps
*NL*
unseemly
curiosity
,
what
were
your
exact
sensations
,
if
you
can
recall
*NL*
them
,
at
the
moment
when
you
made
up
your
mind
to
ask
forgiveness
at
the
*NL*
duel
.
Do
not
think
my
question
frivolous
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
in
*NL*
asking
the
question
a
secret
motive
of
my
own
,
which
I
will
perhaps
*NL*
explain
to
you
later
on
,
if
it
is
God
's
will
that
we
should
become
more
*NL*
intimately
acquainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
he
was
speaking
,
I
was
looking
at
him
straight
into
the
face
*NL*
and
I
felt
all
at
once
a
complete
trust
in
him
and
great
curiosity
on
my
*NL*
side
also
,
for
I
felt
that
there
was
some
strange
secret
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
what
were
my
exact
sensations
at
the
moment
when
I
asked
my
*NL*
opponent
's
forgiveness
,
''
I
answered
;
``
but
I
had
better
tell
you
from
the
*NL*
beginning
what
I
have
not
yet
told
any
one
else
.
''
And
I
described
all
that
*NL*
had
passed
between
Afanasy
and
me
,
and
how
I
had
bowed
down
to
the
ground
*NL*
at
his
feet
.
``
From
that
you
can
see
for
yourself
,
''
I
concluded
,
``
that
at
*NL*
the
time
of
the
duel
it
was
easier
for
me
,
for
I
had
made
a
beginning
*NL*
already
at
home
,
and
when
once
I
had
started
on
that
road
,
to
go
farther
*NL*
along
it
was
far
from
being
difficult
,
but
became
a
source
of
joy
and
*NL*
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
liked
the
way
he
looked
at
me
as
he
listened
.
``
All
that
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
*NL*
exceedingly
interesting
.
I
will
come
to
see
you
again
and
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
from
that
time
forth
he
came
to
see
me
nearly
every
evening
.
And
we
*NL*
should
have
become
greater
friends
,
if
only
he
had
ever
talked
of
himself
.
*NL*
But
about
himself
he
scarcely
ever
said
a
word
,
yet
continually
asked
me
*NL*
about
myself
.
In
spite
of
that
I
became
very
fond
of
him
and
spoke
with
*NL*
perfect
frankness
to
him
about
all
my
feelings
;
``
for
,
''
thought
I
,
``
what
*NL*
need
have
I
to
know
his
secrets
,
since
I
can
see
without
that
that
he
is
a
*NL*
good
man
?
Moreover
,
though
he
is
such
a
serious
man
and
my
senior
,
he
*NL*
comes
to
see
a
youngster
like
me
and
treats
me
as
his
equal
.
''
And
I
*NL*
learned
a
great
deal
that
was
profitable
from
him
,
for
he
was
a
man
of
*NL*
lofty
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
life
is
heaven
,
''
he
said
to
me
suddenly
,
``
that
I
have
long
been
*NL*
thinking
about
''
;
and
all
at
once
he
added
,
``
I
think
of
nothing
else
*NL*
indeed
.
''
He
looked
at
me
and
smiled
.
``
I
am
more
convinced
of
it
than
you
*NL*
are
,
I
will
tell
you
later
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
to
him
and
thought
that
he
evidently
wanted
to
tell
me
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
lies
hidden
within
all
of
us
--
here
it
lies
hidden
in
*NL*
me
now
,
and
if
I
will
it
,
it
will
be
revealed
to
me
to-morrow
and
for
all
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
;
he
was
speaking
with
great
emotion
and
gazing
*NL*
mysteriously
at
me
,
as
if
he
were
questioning
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
we
are
all
responsible
to
all
for
all
,
apart
from
our
own
sins
,
*NL*
you
were
quite
right
in
thinking
that
,
and
it
is
wonderful
how
you
could
*NL*
comprehend
it
in
all
its
significance
at
once
.
And
in
very
truth
,
so
soon
*NL*
as
men
understand
that
,
the
Kingdom
of
Heaven
will
be
for
them
not
a
*NL*
dream
,
but
a
living
reality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
,
''
I
cried
out
to
him
bitterly
,
``
when
will
that
come
to
pass
?
and
*NL*
will
it
ever
come
to
pass
?
Is
not
it
simply
a
dream
of
ours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
,
you
do
n't
believe
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
preach
it
and
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it
yourself
.
Believe
me
,
this
dream
,
as
you
call
it
,
will
come
to
*NL*
pass
without
doubt
;
it
will
come
,
but
not
now
,
for
every
process
has
its
*NL*
law
.
It
's
a
spiritual
,
psychological
process
.
To
transform
the
world
,
to
*NL*
recreate
it
afresh
,
men
must
turn
into
another
path
psychologically
.
Until
*NL*
you
have
become
really
,
in
actual
fact
,
a
brother
to
every
one
,
*NL*
brotherhood
will
not
come
to
pass

No
sort
of
scientific
teaching
,
no
kind
*NL*
of
common
interest
,
will
ever
teach
men
to
share
property
and
privileges
*NL*
with
equal
consideration
for
all
.
Every
one
will
think
his
share
too
small
*NL*
and
they
will
be
always
envying
,
complaining
and
attacking
one
another
.
*NL*
You
ask
when
it
will
come
to
pass
;
it
will
come
to
pass
,
but
first
we
have
*NL*
to
go
through
the
period
of
isolation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
isolation
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
isolation
that
prevails
everywhere
,
above
all
in
our
age
--
it
has
*NL*
not
fully
developed
,
it
has
not
reached
its
limit
yet
.
For
every
one
*NL*
strives
to
keep
his
individuality
as
apart
as
possible
,
wishes
to
secure
*NL*
the
greatest
possible
fullness
of
life
for
himself
;
but
meantime
all
his
*NL*
efforts
result
not
in
attaining
fullness
of
life
but
self-destruction
,
for
*NL*
instead
of
self-realization
he
ends
by
arriving
at
complete
solitude
.
All
*NL*
mankind
in
our
age
have
split
up
into
units
,
they
all
keep
apart
,
each
in
*NL*
his
own
groove
;
each
one
holds
aloof
,
hides
himself
and
hides
what
he
has
,
*NL*
from
the
rest
,
and
he
ends
by
being
repelled
by
others
and
repelling
them
.
*NL*
He
heaps
up
riches
by
himself
and
thinks
,
`
How
strong
I
am
now
and
how
*NL*
secure
,
'
and
in
his
madness
he
does
not
understand
that
the
more
he
heaps
*NL*
up
,
the
more
he
sinks
into
self-destructive
impotence
.
For
he
is
*NL*
accustomed
to
rely
upon
himself
alone
and
to
cut
himself
off
from
the
*NL*
whole
;
he
has
trained
himself
not
to
believe
in
the
help
of
others
,
in
men
*NL*
and
in
humanity
,
and
only
trembles
for
fear
he
should
lose
his
money
and
*NL*
the
privileges
that
he
has
won
for
himself
.
Everywhere
in
these
days
men
*NL*
have
,
in
their
mockery
,
ceased
to
understand
that
the
true
security
is
to
*NL*
be
found
in
social
solidarity
rather
than
in
isolated
individual
effort
.
*NL*
But
this
terrible
individualism
must
inevitably
have
an
end
,
and
all
will
*NL*
suddenly
understand
how
unnaturally
they
are
separated
from
one
another
.
*NL*
It
will
be
the
spirit
of
the
time
,
and
people
will
marvel
that
they
have
*NL*
sat
so
long
in
darkness
without
seeing
the
light
.
And
then
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
Son
of
Man
will
be
seen
in
the
heavens
...
But
,
until
then
,
we
must
keep
*NL*
the
banner
flying
.
Sometimes
even
if
he
has
to
do
it
alone
,
and
his
*NL*
conduct
seems
to
be
crazy
,
a
man
must
set
an
example
,
and
so
draw
men
's
*NL*
souls
out
of
their
solitude
,
and
spur
them
to
some
act
of
brotherly
love
,
*NL*
that
the
great
idea
may
not
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
evenings
,
one
after
another
,
were
spent
in
such
stirring
and
fervent
*NL*
talk
.
I
gave
up
society
and
visited
my
neighbors
much
less
frequently
.
*NL*
Besides
,
my
vogue
was
somewhat
over
.
I
say
this
,
not
as
blame
,
for
they
*NL*
still
loved
me
and
treated
me
good-humoredly
,
but
there
's
no
denying
that
*NL*
fashion
is
a
great
power
in
society
.
I
began
to
regard
my
mysterious
*NL*
visitor
with
admiration
,
for
besides
enjoying
his
intelligence
,
I
began
to
*NL*
perceive
that
he
was
brooding
over
some
plan
in
his
heart
,
and
was
*NL*
preparing
himself
perhaps
for
a
great
deed
.
Perhaps
he
liked
my
not
*NL*
showing
curiosity
about
his
secret
,
not
seeking
to
discover
it
by
direct
*NL*
question
nor
by
insinuation
.
But
I
noticed
at
last
,
that
he
seemed
to
show
*NL*
signs
of
wanting
to
tell
me
something
.
This
had
become
quite
evident
,
*NL*
indeed
,
about
a
month
after
he
first
began
to
visit
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
he
said
to
me
once
,
``
that
people
are
very
inquisitive
about
*NL*
us
in
the
town
and
wonder
why
I
come
to
see
you
so
often
.
But
let
them
*NL*
wonder
,
for
_
soon
all
will
be
explained
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
an
extraordinary
agitation
would
come
over
him
,
and
almost
*NL*
always
on
such
occasions
he
would
get
up
and
go
away
.
Sometimes
he
would
*NL*
fix
a
long
piercing
look
upon
me
,
and
I
thought
,
``
He
will
say
something
*NL*
directly
now
.
''
But
he
would
suddenly
begin
talking
of
something
ordinary
*NL*
and
familiar
.
He
often
complained
of
headache
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
quite
unexpectedly
indeed
,
after
he
had
been
talking
with
great
*NL*
fervor
a
long
time
,
I
saw
him
suddenly
turn
pale
,
and
his
face
worked
*NL*
convulsively
,
while
he
stared
persistently
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
I
said
;
``
do
you
feel
ill
?
''
--
he
had
just
been
*NL*
complaining
of
headache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
...
do
you
know
...
I
murdered
some
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
and
smiled
with
a
face
as
white
as
chalk
.
``
Why
is
it
he
is
*NL*
smiling
?
''
The
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
before
I
realized
anything
*NL*
else
.
I
too
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
?
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
pale
smile
,
``
how
much
it
has
cost
me
to
say
the
*NL*
first
word
.
Now
I
have
said
it
,
I
feel
I
've
taken
the
first
step
and
shall
*NL*
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
while
I
could
not
believe
him
,
and
I
did
not
believe
him
at
*NL*
that
time
,
but
only
after
he
had
been
to
see
me
three
days
running
and
*NL*
told
me
all
about
it
.
I
thought
he
was
mad
,
but
ended
by
being
convinced
,
*NL*
to
my
great
grief
and
amazement
.
His
crime
was
a
great
and
terrible
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fourteen
years
before
,
he
had
murdered
the
widow
of
a
landowner
,
a
wealthy
*NL*
and
handsome
young
woman
who
had
a
house
in
our
town
.
He
fell
passionately
*NL*
in
love
with
her
,
declared
his
feeling
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
marry
*NL*
him
.
But
she
had
already
given
her
heart
to
another
man
,
an
officer
of
*NL*
noble
birth
and
high
rank
in
the
service
,
who
was
at
that
time
away
at
the
*NL*
front
,
though
she
was
expecting
him
soon
to
return
.
She
refused
his
offer
*NL*
and
begged
him
not
to
come
and
see
her
.
After
he
had
ceased
to
visit
her
,
*NL*
he
took
advantage
of
his
knowledge
of
the
house
to
enter
at
night
through
*NL*
the
garden
by
the
roof
,
at
great
risk
of
discovery
.
But
,
as
often
happens
,
*NL*
a
crime
committed
with
extraordinary
audacity
is
more
successful
than
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
the
garret
through
the
skylight
,
he
went
down
the
ladder
,
knowing
*NL*
that
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
sometimes
,
through
the
negligence
of
*NL*
the
servants
,
left
unlocked
.
He
hoped
to
find
it
so
,
and
so
it
was
.
He
*NL*
made
his
way
in
the
dark
to
her
bedroom
,
where
a
light
was
burning
.
As
*NL*
though
on
purpose
,
both
her
maids
had
gone
off
to
a
birthday-party
in
the
*NL*
same
street
,
without
asking
leave
.
The
other
servants
slept
in
the
*NL*
servants
'
quarters
or
in
the
kitchen
on
the
ground-floor
.
His
passion
*NL*
flamed
up
at
the
sight
of
her
asleep
,
and
then
vindictive
,
jealous
anger
*NL*
took
possession
of
his
heart
,
and
like
a
drunken
man
,
beside
himself
,
he
*NL*
thrust
a
knife
into
her
heart
,
so
that
she
did
not
even
cry
out
.
Then
with
*NL*
devilish
and
criminal
cunning
he
contrived
that
suspicion
should
fall
on
*NL*
the
servants
.
He
was
so
base
as
to
take
her
purse
,
to
open
her
chest
with
*NL*
keys
from
under
her
pillow
,
and
to
take
some
things
from
it
,
doing
it
all
*NL*
as
it
might
have
been
done
by
an
ignorant
servant
,
leaving
valuable
papers
*NL*
and
taking
only
money
.
He
took
some
of
the
larger
gold
things
,
but
left
*NL*
smaller
articles
that
were
ten
times
as
valuable
.
He
took
with
him
,
too
,
*NL*
some
things
for
himself
as
remembrances
,
but
of
that
later
.
Having
done
*NL*
this
awful
deed
,
he
returned
by
the
way
he
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
the
next
day
,
when
the
alarm
was
raised
,
nor
at
any
time
after
in
*NL*
his
life
,
did
any
one
dream
of
suspecting
that
he
was
the
criminal
.
No
one
*NL*
indeed
knew
of
his
love
for
her
,
for
he
was
always
reserved
and
silent
and
*NL*
had
no
friend
to
whom
he
would
have
opened
his
heart
.
He
was
looked
upon
*NL*
simply
as
an
acquaintance
,
and
not
a
very
intimate
one
,
of
the
murdered
*NL*
woman
,
as
for
the
previous
fortnight
he
had
not
even
visited
her
.
A
serf
*NL*
of
hers
called
Pyotr
was
at
once
suspected
,
and
every
circumstance
*NL*
confirmed
the
suspicion
.
The
man
knew
--
indeed
his
mistress
did
not
conceal
*NL*
the
fact
--
that
having
to
send
one
of
her
serfs
as
a
recruit
she
had
decided
*NL*
to
send
him
,
as
he
had
no
relations
and
his
conduct
was
unsatisfactory
.
*NL*
People
had
heard
him
angrily
threatening
to
murder
her
when
he
was
drunk
*NL*
in
a
tavern
.
Two
days
before
her
death
,
he
had
run
away
,
staying
no
one
*NL*
knew
where
in
the
town
.
The
day
after
the
murder
,
he
was
found
on
the
road
*NL*
leading
out
of
the
town
,
dead
drunk
,
with
a
knife
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
*NL*
right
hand
happened
to
be
stained
with
blood
.
He
declared
that
his
nose
*NL*
had
been
bleeding
,
but
no
one
believed
him
.
The
maids
confessed
that
they
*NL*
had
gone
to
a
party
and
that
the
street-door
had
been
left
open
till
they
*NL*
returned
.
And
a
number
of
similar
details
came
to
light
,
throwing
*NL*
suspicion
on
the
innocent
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrested
him
,
and
he
was
tried
for
the
murder
;
but
a
week
after
the
*NL*
arrest
,
the
prisoner
fell
sick
of
a
fever
and
died
unconscious
in
the
*NL*
hospital
.
There
the
matter
ended
and
the
judges
and
the
authorities
and
*NL*
every
one
in
the
town
remained
convinced
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
*NL*
by
no
one
but
the
servant
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
.
And
after
that
the
*NL*
punishment
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mysterious
visitor
,
now
my
friend
,
told
me
that
at
first
he
was
not
in
*NL*
the
least
troubled
by
pangs
of
conscience
.
He
was
miserable
a
long
time
,
*NL*
but
not
for
that
reason
;
only
from
regret
that
he
had
killed
the
woman
he
*NL*
loved
,
that
she
was
no
more
,
that
in
killing
her
he
had
killed
his
love
,
*NL*
while
the
fire
of
passion
was
still
in
his
veins
.
But
of
the
innocent
*NL*
blood
he
had
shed
,
of
the
murder
of
a
fellow
creature
,
he
scarcely
*NL*
thought
.
The
thought
that
his
victim
might
have
become
the
wife
of
another
*NL*
man
was
insupportable
to
him
,
and
so
,
for
a
long
time
,
he
was
convinced
in
*NL*
his
conscience
that
he
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
was
worried
at
the
arrest
of
the
servant
,
but
his
illness
and
*NL*
death
soon
set
his
mind
at
rest
,
for
the
man
's
death
was
apparently
-LRB-
so
he
*NL*
reflected
at
the
time
-RRB-
not
owing
to
his
arrest
or
his
fright
,
but
a
chill
*NL*
he
had
taken
on
the
day
he
ran
away
,
when
he
had
lain
all
night
dead
drunk
*NL*
on
the
damp
ground
.
The
theft
of
the
money
and
other
things
troubled
him
*NL*
little
,
for
he
argued
that
the
theft
had
not
been
committed
for
gain
but
*NL*
to
avert
suspicion
.
The
sum
stolen
was
small
,
and
he
shortly
afterwards
*NL*
subscribed
the
whole
of
it
,
and
much
more
,
towards
the
funds
for
*NL*
maintaining
an
almshouse
in
the
town
.
He
did
this
on
purpose
to
set
his
*NL*
conscience
at
rest
about
the
theft
,
and
it
's
a
remarkable
fact
that
for
a
*NL*
long
time
he
really
was
at
peace
--
he
told
me
this
himself
.
He
entered
then
*NL*
upon
a
career
of
great
activity
in
the
service
,
volunteered
for
a
*NL*
difficult
and
laborious
duty
,
which
occupied
him
two
years
,
and
being
a
*NL*
man
of
strong
will
almost
forgot
the
past
.
Whenever
he
recalled
it
,
he
*NL*
tried
not
to
think
of
it
at
all
.
He
became
active
in
philanthropy
too
,
*NL*
founded
and
helped
to
maintain
many
institutions
in
the
town
,
did
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
the
two
capitals
,
and
in
both
Moscow
and
Petersburg
was
elected
a
*NL*
member
of
philanthropic
societies
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
however
,
he
began
brooding
over
the
past
,
and
the
strain
of
it
*NL*
was
too
much
for
him
.
Then
he
was
attracted
by
a
fine
and
intelligent
girl
*NL*
and
soon
after
married
her
,
hoping
that
marriage
would
dispel
his
lonely
*NL*
depression
,
and
that
by
entering
on
a
new
life
and
scrupulously
doing
his
*NL*
duty
to
his
wife
and
children
,
he
would
escape
from
old
memories
*NL*
altogether
.
But
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
expected
happened
.
He
began
,
*NL*
even
in
the
first
month
of
his
marriage
,
to
be
continually
fretted
by
the
*NL*
thought
,
``
My
wife
loves
me
--
but
what
if
she
knew
?
''
When
she
first
told
him
*NL*
that
she
would
soon
bear
him
a
child
,
he
was
troubled
.
``
I
am
giving
life
,
*NL*
but
I
have
taken
life
.
''
Children
came
.
``
How
dare
I
love
them
,
teach
and
*NL*
educate
them
,
how
can
I
talk
to
them
of
virtue
?
I
have
shed
blood
.
''
They
*NL*
were
splendid
children
,
he
longed
to
caress
them
;
``
and
I
ca
n't
look
at
*NL*
their
innocent
candid
faces
,
I
am
unworthy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
began
to
be
bitterly
and
ominously
haunted
by
the
blood
of
his
*NL*
murdered
victim
,
by
the
young
life
he
had
destroyed
,
by
the
blood
that
*NL*
cried
out
for
vengeance
.
He
had
begun
to
have
awful
dreams
.
But
,
being
a
*NL*
man
of
fortitude
,
he
bore
his
suffering
a
long
time
,
thinking
:
``
I
shall
*NL*
expiate
everything
by
this
secret
agony
.
''
But
that
hope
,
too
,
was
vain
;
*NL*
the
longer
it
went
on
,
the
more
intense
was
his
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
respected
in
society
for
his
active
benevolence
,
though
every
one
*NL*
was
overawed
by
his
stern
and
gloomy
character
.
But
the
more
he
was
*NL*
respected
,
the
more
intolerable
it
was
for
him
.
He
confessed
to
me
that
he
*NL*
had
thoughts
of
killing
himself
.
But
he
began
to
be
haunted
by
another
*NL*
idea
--
an
idea
which
he
had
at
first
regarded
as
impossible
and
unthinkable
,
*NL*
though
at
last
it
got
such
a
hold
on
his
heart
that
he
could
not
shake
it
*NL*
off
.
He
dreamed
of
rising
up
,
going
out
and
confessing
in
the
face
of
all
*NL*
men
that
he
had
committed
murder
.
For
three
years
this
dream
had
pursued
*NL*
him
,
haunting
him
in
different
forms
.
At
last
he
believed
with
his
whole
*NL*
heart
that
if
he
confessed
his
crime
,
he
would
heal
his
soul
and
would
be
*NL*
at
peace
for
ever
.
But
this
belief
filled
his
heart
with
terror
,
for
how
*NL*
could
he
carry
it
out
?
And
then
came
what
happened
at
my
duel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looking
at
you
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
I
cried
,
clasping
my
hands
,
``
that
such
a
trivial
*NL*
incident
could
give
rise
to
such
a
resolution
in
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
resolution
has
been
growing
for
the
last
three
years
,
''
he
answered
,
*NL*
``
and
your
story
only
gave
the
last
touch
to
it
.
Looking
at
you
,
I
*NL*
reproached
myself
and
envied
you
.
''
He
said
this
to
me
almost
sullenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
wo
n't
be
believed
,
''
I
observed
;
``
it
's
fourteen
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
proofs
,
great
proofs
.
I
shall
show
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
cried
and
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
one
thing
,
one
thing
,
''
he
said
-LRB-
as
though
it
all
depended
upon
*NL*
me
-RRB-
,
``
my
wife
,
my
children
!
My
wife
may
die
of
grief
,
and
though
my
*NL*
children
wo
n't
lose
their
rank
and
property
,
they
'll
be
a
convict
's
*NL*
children
and
for
ever
!
And
what
a
memory
,
what
a
memory
of
me
I
shall
*NL*
leave
in
their
hearts
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
part
from
them
,
to
leave
them
for
ever
?
It
's
for
ever
,
you
know
,
*NL*
for
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
still
and
repeated
a
silent
prayer
.
I
got
up
at
last
,
I
felt
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
He
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
said
I
,
``
confess
.
Everything
passes
,
only
the
truth
remains
.
Your
*NL*
children
will
understand
,
when
they
grow
up
,
the
nobility
of
your
*NL*
resolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
me
that
time
as
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
.
Yet
for
more
than
*NL*
a
fortnight
afterwards
,
he
came
to
me
every
evening
,
still
preparing
*NL*
himself
,
still
unable
to
bring
himself
to
the
point
.
He
made
my
heart
*NL*
ache
.
One
day
he
would
come
determined
and
say
fervently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
will
be
heaven
for
me
,
heaven
,
the
moment
I
confess
.
Fourteen
*NL*
years
I
've
been
in
hell
.
I
want
to
suffer
.
I
will
take
my
punishment
and
*NL*
begin
to
live
.
You
can
pass
through
the
world
doing
wrong
,
but
there
's
no
*NL*
turning
back
.
Now
I
dare
not
love
my
neighbor
nor
even
my
own
children
.
*NL*
Good
God
,
my
children
will
understand
,
perhaps
,
what
my
punishment
has
*NL*
cost
me
and
will
not
condemn
me
!
God
is
not
in
strength
but
in
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
will
understand
your
sacrifice
,
''
I
said
to
him
,
``
if
not
at
once
,
they
*NL*
will
understand
later
;
for
you
have
served
truth
,
the
higher
truth
,
not
of
*NL*
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
would
go
away
seeming
comforted
,
but
next
day
he
would
come
again
,
*NL*
bitter
,
pale
,
sarcastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
time
I
come
to
you
,
you
look
at
me
so
inquisitively
as
though
to
*NL*
say
,
`
He
has
still
not
confessed
!
'
Wait
a
bit
,
do
n't
despise
me
too
much
.
*NL*
It
's
not
such
an
easy
thing
to
do
,
as
you
would
think
.
Perhaps
I
shall
not
*NL*
do
it
at
all
.
You
wo
n't
go
and
inform
against
me
then
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
far
from
looking
at
him
with
indiscreet
curiosity
,
I
was
afraid
to
*NL*
look
at
him
at
all
.
I
was
quite
ill
from
anxiety
,
and
my
heart
was
full
of
*NL*
tears
.
I
could
not
sleep
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
come
from
my
wife
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Do
you
understand
what
the
*NL*
word
`
wife
'
means
?
When
I
went
out
,
the
children
called
to
me
,
`
Good-by
,
*NL*
father
,
make
haste
back
to
read
_
The
Children
's
Magazine
_
with
us
.
'
No
,
*NL*
you
do
n't
understand
that
!
No
one
is
wise
from
another
man
's
woe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
were
glittering
,
his
lips
were
twitching
.
Suddenly
he
struck
the
*NL*
table
with
his
fist
so
that
everything
on
it
danced
--
it
was
the
first
time
*NL*
he
had
done
such
a
thing
,
he
was
such
a
mild
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
need
I
?
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
must
I
?
No
one
has
been
condemned
,
no
one
has
*NL*
been
sent
to
Siberia
in
my
place
,
the
man
died
of
fever
.
And
I
've
been
*NL*
punished
by
my
sufferings
for
the
blood
I
shed
.
And
I
sha
n't
be
believed
,
*NL*
they
wo
n't
believe
my
proofs
.
Need
I
confess
,
need
I
?
I
am
ready
to
go
on
*NL*
suffering
all
my
life
for
the
blood
I
have
shed
,
if
only
my
wife
and
*NL*
children
may
be
spared
.
Will
it
be
just
to
ruin
them
with
me
?
Are
n't
we
*NL*
making
a
mistake
?
What
is
right
in
this
case
?
And
will
people
recognize
*NL*
it
,
will
they
appreciate
it
,
will
they
respect
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
''
I
thought
to
myself
,
``
he
is
thinking
of
other
people
's
*NL*
respect
at
such
a
moment
!
''
And
I
felt
so
sorry
for
him
then
,
that
I
*NL*
believe
I
would
have
shared
his
fate
if
it
could
have
comforted
him
.
I
saw
*NL*
he
was
beside
himself
.
I
was
aghast
,
realizing
with
my
heart
as
well
as
my
*NL*
mind
what
such
a
resolution
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decide
my
fate
!
''
he
exclaimed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
confess
,
''
I
whispered
to
him
.
My
voice
failed
me
,
but
I
whispered
*NL*
it
firmly
.
I
took
up
the
New
Testament
from
the
table
,
the
Russian
*NL*
translation
,
and
showed
him
the
Gospel
of
St.
John
,
chapter
xii
.
verse
24
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
verily
,
I
say
unto
you
,
except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
*NL*
ground
and
die
,
it
abideth
alone
:
but
if
it
die
,
it
bringeth
forth
much
*NL*
fruit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
just
been
reading
that
verse
when
he
came
in
.
He
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
he
said
,
but
he
smiled
bitterly
.
``
It
's
terrible
the
things
*NL*
you
find
in
those
books
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
``
It
's
easy
enough
to
*NL*
thrust
them
upon
one
.
And
who
wrote
them
?
Can
they
have
been
written
by
*NL*
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Holy
Spirit
wrote
them
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
easy
for
you
to
prate
,
''
he
smiled
again
,
this
time
almost
with
*NL*
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
book
again
,
opened
it
in
another
place
and
showed
him
the
*NL*
Epistle
to
the
Hebrews
,
chapter
x.
verse
31
.
He
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
it
and
simply
flung
down
the
book
.
He
was
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
awful
text
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
's
no
denying
you
've
picked
out
fitting
*NL*
ones
.
''
He
rose
from
the
chair
.
``
Well
!
''
he
said
,
``
good-by
,
perhaps
I
sha
n't
*NL*
come
again
...
we
shall
meet
in
heaven
.
So
I
have
been
for
fourteen
years
*NL*
`
in
the
hands
of
the
living
God
,
'
that
's
how
one
must
think
of
those
*NL*
fourteen
years
.
To-morrow
I
will
beseech
those
hands
to
let
me
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
take
him
in
my
arms
and
kiss
him
,
but
I
did
not
dare
--
his
face
*NL*
was
contorted
and
somber
.
He
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
''
I
thought
,
``
what
has
he
gone
to
face
!
''
I
fell
on
my
knees
*NL*
before
the
ikon
and
wept
for
him
before
the
Holy
Mother
of
God
,
our
swift
*NL*
defender
and
helper
.
I
was
half
an
hour
praying
in
tears
,
and
it
was
late
,
*NL*
about
midnight
.
Suddenly
I
saw
the
door
open
and
he
came
in
again
.
I
was
*NL*
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
've
forgotten
something
...
my
handkerchief
,
I
*NL*
think
...
Well
,
even
if
I
've
not
forgotten
anything
,
let
me
stay
a
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
.
I
stood
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sit
down
,
too
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
.
We
sat
still
for
two
minutes
;
he
looked
intently
at
me
and
*NL*
suddenly
smiled
--
I
remembered
that
--
then
he
got
up
,
embraced
me
warmly
and
*NL*
kissed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
I
came
to
you
a
second
time
.
Do
you
hear
,
*NL*
remember
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
''
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
.
I
did
not
know
that
evening
that
the
next
day
was
his
*NL*
birthday
.
I
had
not
been
out
for
the
last
few
days
,
so
I
had
no
chance
of
*NL*
hearing
it
from
any
one
.
On
that
day
he
always
had
a
great
gathering
,
*NL*
every
one
in
the
town
went
to
it
.
It
was
the
same
this
time
.
After
dinner
*NL*
he
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
--
a
formal
*NL*
declaration
to
the
chief
of
his
department
who
was
present
.
This
*NL*
declaration
he
read
aloud
to
the
whole
assembly
.
It
contained
a
full
*NL*
account
of
the
crime
,
in
every
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
cut
myself
off
from
men
as
a
monster
.
God
has
visited
me
,
''
he
said
in
*NL*
conclusion
.
``
I
want
to
suffer
for
my
sin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
brought
out
and
laid
on
the
table
all
the
things
he
had
been
*NL*
keeping
for
fourteen
years
,
that
he
thought
would
prove
his
crime
,
the
*NL*
jewels
belonging
to
the
murdered
woman
which
he
had
stolen
to
divert
*NL*
suspicion
,
a
cross
and
a
locket
taken
from
her
neck
with
a
portrait
of
her
*NL*
betrothed
in
the
locket
,
her
notebook
and
two
letters
;
one
from
her
*NL*
betrothed
,
telling
her
that
he
would
soon
be
with
her
,
and
her
unfinished
*NL*
answer
left
on
the
table
to
be
sent
off
next
day
.
He
carried
off
these
two
*NL*
letters
--
what
for
?
Why
had
he
kept
them
for
fourteen
years
afterwards
*NL*
instead
of
destroying
them
as
evidence
against
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
is
what
happened
:
every
one
was
amazed
and
horrified
,
every
one
*NL*
refused
to
believe
it
and
thought
that
he
was
deranged
,
though
all
*NL*
listened
with
intense
curiosity
.
A
few
days
later
it
was
fully
decided
and
*NL*
agreed
in
every
house
that
the
unhappy
man
was
mad
.
The
legal
authorities
*NL*
could
not
refuse
to
take
the
case
up
,
but
they
too
dropped
it
.
Though
the
*NL*
trinkets
and
letters
made
them
ponder
,
they
decided
that
even
if
they
did
*NL*
turn
out
to
be
authentic
,
no
charge
could
be
based
on
those
alone
.
*NL*
Besides
,
she
might
have
given
him
those
things
as
a
friend
,
or
asked
him
*NL*
to
take
care
of
them
for
her
.
I
heard
afterwards
,
however
,
that
the
*NL*
genuineness
of
the
things
was
proved
by
the
friends
and
relations
of
the
*NL*
murdered
woman
,
and
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
them
.
Yet
nothing
was
*NL*
destined
to
come
of
it
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
days
later
,
all
had
heard
that
he
was
ill
and
that
his
life
was
in
*NL*
danger
.
The
nature
of
his
illness
I
ca
n't
explain
,
they
said
it
was
an
*NL*
affection
of
the
heart
.
But
it
became
known
that
the
doctors
had
been
*NL*
induced
by
his
wife
to
investigate
his
mental
condition
also
,
and
had
come
*NL*
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
case
of
insanity
.
I
betrayed
nothing
,
*NL*
though
people
ran
to
question
me
.
But
when
I
wanted
to
visit
him
,
I
was
*NL*
for
a
long
while
forbidden
to
do
so
,
above
all
by
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
you
who
have
caused
his
illness
,
''
she
said
to
me
;
``
he
was
always
*NL*
gloomy
,
but
for
the
last
year
people
noticed
that
he
was
peculiarly
*NL*
excited
and
did
strange
things
,
and
now
you
have
been
the
ruin
of
him
.
*NL*
Your
preaching
has
brought
him
to
this
;
for
the
last
month
he
was
always
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
not
only
his
wife
but
the
whole
town
were
down
upon
me
and
blamed
*NL*
me
.
``
It
's
all
your
doing
,
''
they
said
.
I
was
silent
and
indeed
rejoiced
at
*NL*
heart
,
for
I
saw
plainly
God
's
mercy
to
the
man
who
had
turned
against
*NL*
himself
and
punished
himself
.
I
could
not
believe
in
his
insanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
let
me
see
him
at
last
,
he
insisted
upon
saying
good-by
to
me
.
I
went
*NL*
in
to
him
and
saw
at
once
,
that
not
only
his
days
,
but
his
hours
were
*NL*
numbered
.
He
was
weak
,
yellow
,
his
hands
trembled
,
he
gasped
for
breath
,
*NL*
but
his
face
was
full
of
tender
and
happy
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
long
been
yearning
to
see
you
,
why
did
n't
you
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
tell
him
that
they
would
not
let
me
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
has
had
pity
on
me
and
is
calling
me
to
Himself
.
I
know
I
am
dying
,
*NL*
but
I
feel
joy
and
peace
for
the
first
time
after
so
many
years
.
There
was
*NL*
heaven
in
my
heart
from
the
moment
I
had
done
what
I
had
to
do
.
Now
I
dare
*NL*
to
love
my
children
and
to
kiss
them
.
Neither
my
wife
nor
the
judges
,
nor
*NL*
any
one
has
believed
it
.
My
children
will
never
believe
it
either
.
I
see
*NL*
in
that
God
's
mercy
to
them
.
I
shall
die
,
and
my
name
will
be
without
a
*NL*
stain
for
them
.
And
now
I
feel
God
near
,
my
heart
rejoices
as
in
Heaven
*NL*
...
I
have
done
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
speak
,
he
gasped
for
breath
,
he
pressed
my
hand
warmly
,
*NL*
looking
fervently
at
me
.
We
did
not
talk
for
long
,
his
wife
kept
peeping
*NL*
in
at
us
.
But
he
had
time
to
whisper
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
how
I
came
back
to
you
that
second
time
,
at
midnight
?
I
*NL*
told
you
to
remember
it
.
You
know
what
I
came
back
for
?
I
came
to
kill
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
out
from
you
then
into
the
darkness
,
I
wandered
about
the
streets
,
*NL*
struggling
with
myself
.
And
suddenly
I
hated
you
so
that
I
could
hardly
*NL*
bear
it
.
Now
,
I
thought
,
he
is
all
that
binds
me
,
and
he
is
my
judge
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
refuse
to
face
my
punishment
to-morrow
,
for
he
knows
all
.
It
was
not
*NL*
that
I
was
afraid
you
would
betray
me
-LRB-
I
never
even
thought
of
that
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
I
thought
,
`
How
can
I
look
him
in
the
face
if
I
do
n't
confess
?
'
And
if
you
*NL*
had
been
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
,
but
alive
,
it
would
have
been
all
*NL*
the
same
,
the
thought
was
unendurable
that
you
were
alive
knowing
*NL*
everything
and
condemning
me
.
I
hated
you
as
though
you
were
the
cause
,
as
*NL*
though
you
were
to
blame
for
everything
.
I
came
back
to
you
then
,
*NL*
remembering
that
you
had
a
dagger
lying
on
your
table
.
I
sat
down
and
*NL*
asked
you
to
sit
down
,
and
for
a
whole
minute
I
pondered
.
If
I
had
killed
*NL*
you
,
I
should
have
been
ruined
by
that
murder
even
if
I
had
not
confessed
*NL*
the
other
.
But
I
did
n't
think
about
that
at
all
,
and
I
did
n't
want
to
*NL*
think
of
it
at
that
moment
.
I
only
hated
you
and
longed
to
revenge
myself
*NL*
on
you
for
everything
.
The
Lord
vanquished
the
devil
in
my
heart
.
But
let
*NL*
me
tell
you
,
you
were
never
nearer
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
he
died
.
The
whole
town
followed
him
to
the
grave
.
The
chief
*NL*
priest
made
a
speech
full
of
feeling
.
All
lamented
the
terrible
illness
*NL*
that
had
cut
short
his
days
.
But
all
the
town
was
up
in
arms
against
me
*NL*
after
the
funeral
,
and
people
even
refused
to
see
me
.
Some
,
at
first
a
few
*NL*
and
afterwards
more
,
began
indeed
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
his
story
,
*NL*
and
they
visited
me
and
questioned
me
with
great
interest
and
eagerness
,
*NL*
for
man
loves
to
see
the
downfall
and
disgrace
of
the
righteous
.
But
I
*NL*
held
my
tongue
,
and
very
shortly
after
,
I
left
the
town
,
and
five
months
*NL*
later
by
God
's
grace
I
entered
upon
the
safe
and
blessed
path
,
praising
*NL*
the
unseen
finger
which
had
guided
me
so
clearly
to
it
.
But
I
remember
in
*NL*
my
prayer
to
this
day
,
the
servant
of
God
,
Mihail
,
who
suffered
so
*NL*
greatly

The
Russian
Monk
and
his
possible
Significance
_
*NL*
*NL*
Fathers
and
teachers
,
what
is
the
monk
?
In
the
cultivated
world
the
word
*NL*
is
nowadays
pronounced
by
some
people
with
a
jeer
,
and
by
others
it
is
*NL*
used
as
a
term
of
abuse
,
and
this
contempt
for
the
monk
is
growing
.
It
is
*NL*
true
,
alas
,
it
is
true
,
that
there
are
many
sluggards
,
gluttons
,
*NL*
profligates
and
insolent
beggars
among
monks
.
Educated
people
point
to
*NL*
these
:
``
You
are
idlers
,
useless
members
of
society
,
you
live
on
the
labor
*NL*
of
others
,
you
are
shameless
beggars
.
''
And
yet
how
many
meek
and
humble
*NL*
monks
there
are
,
yearning
for
solitude
and
fervent
prayer
in
peace
!
These
*NL*
are
less
noticed
,
or
passed
over
in
silence
.
And
how
surprised
men
would
*NL*
be
if
I
were
to
say
that
from
these
meek
monks
,
who
yearn
for
solitary
*NL*
prayer
,
the
salvation
of
Russia
will
come
perhaps
once
more
!
For
they
are
*NL*
in
truth
made
ready
in
peace
and
quiet
``
for
the
day
and
the
hour
,
the
*NL*
month
and
the
year
.
''
Meanwhile
,
in
their
solitude
,
they
keep
the
image
of
*NL*
Christ
fair
and
undefiled
,
in
the
purity
of
God
's
truth
,
from
the
times
of
*NL*
the
Fathers
of
old
,
the
Apostles
and
the
martyrs
.
And
when
the
time
comes
*NL*
they
will
show
it
to
the
tottering
creeds
of
the
world
.
That
is
a
great
*NL*
thought
.
That
star
will
rise
out
of
the
East
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
my
view
of
the
monk
,
and
is
it
false
?
is
it
too
proud
?
Look
at
the
*NL*
worldly
and
all
who
set
themselves
up
above
the
people
of
God
,
has
not
*NL*
God
's
image
and
His
truth
been
distorted
in
them
?
They
have
science
;
but
*NL*
in
science
there
is
nothing
but
what
is
the
object
of
sense
.
The
spiritual
*NL*
world
,
the
higher
part
of
man
's
being
is
rejected
altogether
,
dismissed
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
triumph
,
even
with
hatred
.
The
world
has
proclaimed
the
*NL*
reign
of
freedom
,
especially
of
late
,
but
what
do
we
see
in
this
freedom
*NL*
of
theirs
?
Nothing
but
slavery
and
self-destruction
!
For
the
world
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
desires
and
so
satisfy
them
,
for
you
have
the
same
rights
as
the
*NL*
most
rich
and
powerful
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
satisfying
them
and
even
*NL*
multiply
your
desires
.
''
That
is
the
modern
doctrine
of
the
world
.
In
that
*NL*
they
see
freedom
.
And
what
follows
from
this
right
of
multiplication
of
*NL*
desires
?
In
the
rich
,
isolation
and
spiritual
suicide
;
in
the
poor
,
envy
*NL*
and
murder
;
for
they
have
been
given
rights
,
but
have
not
been
shown
the
*NL*
means
of
satisfying
their
wants
.
They
maintain
that
the
world
is
getting
*NL*
more
and
more
united
,
more
and
more
bound
together
in
brotherly
community
,
*NL*
as
it
overcomes
distance
and
sets
thoughts
flying
through
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
put
no
faith
in
such
a
bond
of
union
.
Interpreting
freedom
as
the
*NL*
multiplication
and
rapid
satisfaction
of
desires
,
men
distort
their
own
*NL*
nature
,
for
many
senseless
and
foolish
desires
and
habits
and
ridiculous
*NL*
fancies
are
fostered
in
them
.
They
live
only
for
mutual
envy
,
for
luxury
*NL*
and
ostentation
.
To
have
dinners
,
visits
,
carriages
,
rank
and
slaves
to
*NL*
wait
on
one
is
looked
upon
as
a
necessity
,
for
which
life
,
honor
and
human
*NL*
feeling
are
sacrificed
,
and
men
even
commit
suicide
if
they
are
unable
to
*NL*
satisfy
it
.
We
see
the
same
thing
among
those
who
are
not
rich
,
while
the
*NL*
poor
drown
their
unsatisfied
need
and
their
envy
in
drunkenness
.
But
soon
*NL*
they
will
drink
blood
instead
of
wine
,
they
are
being
led
on
to
it
.
I
ask
*NL*
you
is
such
a
man
free
?
I
knew
one
``
champion
of
freedom
''
who
told
me
*NL*
himself
that
,
when
he
was
deprived
of
tobacco
in
prison
,
he
was
so
*NL*
wretched
at
the
privation
that
he
almost
went
and
betrayed
his
cause
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
getting
tobacco
again
!
And
such
a
man
says
,
``
I
am
fighting
for
*NL*
the
cause
of
humanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
can
such
a
one
fight
?
what
is
he
fit
for
?
He
is
capable
perhaps
of
*NL*
some
action
quickly
over
,
but
he
can
not
hold
out
long
.
And
it
's
no
wonder
*NL*
that
instead
of
gaining
freedom
they
have
sunk
into
slavery
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
serving
the
cause
of
brotherly
love
and
the
union
of
humanity
have
*NL*
fallen
,
on
the
contrary
,
into
dissension
and
isolation
,
as
my
mysterious
*NL*
visitor
and
teacher
said
to
me
in
my
youth
.
And
therefore
the
idea
of
the
*NL*
service
of
humanity
,
of
brotherly
love
and
the
solidarity
of
mankind
,
is
*NL*
more
and
more
dying
out
in
the
world
,
and
indeed
this
idea
is
sometimes
*NL*
treated
with
derision
.
For
how
can
a
man
shake
off
his
habits
?
What
can
*NL*
become
of
him
if
he
is
in
such
bondage
to
the
habit
of
satisfying
the
*NL*
innumerable
desires
he
has
created
for
himself
?
He
is
isolated
,
and
what
*NL*
concern
has
he
with
the
rest
of
humanity
?
They
have
succeeded
in
*NL*
accumulating
a
greater
mass
of
objects
,
but
the
joy
in
the
world
has
grown
*NL*
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monastic
way
is
very
different
.
Obedience
,
fasting
and
prayer
are
*NL*
laughed
at
,
yet
only
through
them
lies
the
way
to
real
,
true
freedom
.
I
*NL*
cut
off
my
superfluous
and
unnecessary
desires
,
I
subdue
my
proud
and
*NL*
wanton
will
and
chastise
it
with
obedience
,
and
with
God
's
help
I
attain
*NL*
freedom
of
spirit
and
with
it
spiritual
joy
.
Which
is
most
capable
of
*NL*
conceiving
a
great
idea
and
serving
it
--
the
rich
man
in
his
isolation
or
*NL*
the
man
who
has
freed
himself
from
the
tyranny
of
material
things
and
*NL*
habits
?
The
monk
is
reproached
for
his
solitude
,
``
You
have
secluded
*NL*
yourself
within
the
walls
of
the
monastery
for
your
own
salvation
,
and
*NL*
have
forgotten
the
brotherly
service
of
humanity
!
''
But
we
shall
see
which
*NL*
will
be
most
zealous
in
the
cause
of
brotherly
love
.
For
it
is
not
we
,
but
*NL*
they
,
who
are
in
isolation
,
though
they
do
n't
see
that
.
Of
old
,
leaders
of
*NL*
the
people
came
from
among
us
,
and
why
should
they
not
again
?
The
same
*NL*
meek
and
humble
ascetics
will
rise
up
and
go
out
to
work
for
the
great
*NL*
cause
.
The
salvation
of
Russia
comes
from
the
people
.
And
the
Russian
monk
*NL*
has
always
been
on
the
side
of
the
people
.
We
are
isolated
only
if
the
*NL*
people
are
isolated
.
The
people
believe
as
we
do
,
and
an
unbelieving
*NL*
reformer
will
never
do
anything
in
Russia
,
even
if
he
is
sincere
in
heart
*NL*
and
a
genius
.
Remember
that
!
The
people
will
meet
the
atheist
and
overcome
*NL*
him
,
and
Russia
will
be
one
and
orthodox
.
Take
care
of
the
peasant
and
*NL*
guard
his
heart
.
Go
on
educating
him
quietly
.
That
's
your
duty
as
monks
,
*NL*
for
the
peasant
has
God
in
his
heart
.

*NL*
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
deny
that
there
is
sin
in
the
peasants
too
.
And
the
*NL*
fire
of
corruption
is
spreading
visibly
,
hourly
,
working
from
above
*NL*
downwards
.
The
spirit
of
isolation
is
coming
upon
the
people
too
.
Money
-
*NL*
lenders
and
devourers
of
the
commune
are
rising
up
.
Already
the
merchant
*NL*
grows
more
and
more
eager
for
rank
,
and
strives
to
show
himself
cultured
*NL*
though
he
has
not
a
trace
of
culture
,
and
to
this
end
meanly
despises
his
*NL*
old
traditions
,
and
is
even
ashamed
of
the
faith
of
his
fathers
.
He
visits
*NL*
princes
,
though
he
is
only
a
peasant
corrupted
.
The
peasants
are
rotting
*NL*
in
drunkenness
and
can
not
shake
off
the
habit
.
And
what
cruelty
to
their
*NL*
wives
,
to
their
children
even
!
All
from
drunkenness
!
I
've
seen
in
the
*NL*
factories
children
of
nine
years
old
,
frail
,
rickety
,
bent
and
already
*NL*
depraved
.
The
stuffy
workshop
,
the
din
of
machinery
,
work
all
day
long
,
*NL*
the
vile
language
and
the
drink
,
the
drink
--
is
that
what
a
little
child
's
*NL*
heart
needs
?
He
needs
sunshine
,
childish
play
,
good
examples
all
about
*NL*
him
,
and
at
least
a
little
love
.
There
must
be
no
more
of
this
,
monks
,
no
*NL*
more
torturing
of
children
,
rise
up
and
preach
that
,
make
haste
,
make
*NL*
haste
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
God
will
save
Russia
,
for
though
the
peasants
are
corrupted
and
can
not
*NL*
renounce
their
filthy
sin
,
yet
they
know
it
is
cursed
by
God
and
that
they
*NL*
do
wrong
in
sinning
.
So
that
our
people
still
believe
in
righteousness
,
*NL*
have
faith
in
God
and
weep
tears
of
devotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
different
with
the
upper
classes
.
They
,
following
science
,
want
to
*NL*
base
justice
on
reason
alone
,
but
not
with
Christ
,
as
before
,
and
they
*NL*
have
already
proclaimed
that
there
is
no
crime
,
that
there
is
no
sin
.
And
*NL*
that
's
consistent
,
for
if
you
have
no
God
what
is
the
meaning
of
crime
?
In
*NL*
Europe
the
people
are
already
rising
up
against
the
rich
with
violence
,
*NL*
and
the
leaders
of
the
people
are
everywhere
leading
them
to
bloodshed
,
*NL*
and
teaching
them
that
their
wrath
is
righteous
.
But
their
``
wrath
is
*NL*
accursed
,
for
it
is
cruel
.
''
But
God
will
save
Russia
as
He
has
saved
her
*NL*
many
times
.
Salvation
will
come
from
the
people
,
from
their
faith
and
*NL*
their
meekness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fathers
and
teachers
,
watch
over
the
people
's
faith
and
this
will
not
be
a
*NL*
dream
.
I
've
been
struck
all
my
life
in
our
great
people
by
their
dignity
,
*NL*
their
true
and
seemly
dignity
.
I
've
seen
it
myself
,
I
can
testify
to
it
,
*NL*
I
've
seen
it
and
marveled
at
it
,
I
've
seen
it
in
spite
of
the
degraded
*NL*
sins
and
poverty-stricken
appearance
of
our
peasantry
.
They
are
not
*NL*
servile
,
and
even
after
two
centuries
of
serfdom
they
are
free
in
manner
*NL*
and
bearing
,
yet
without
insolence
,
and
not
revengeful
and
not
envious
.
*NL*
``
You
are
rich
and
noble
,
you
are
clever
and
talented
,
well
,
be
so
,
God
*NL*
bless
you
.
I
respect
you
,
but
I
know
that
I
too
am
a
man
.
By
the
very
fact
*NL*
that
I
respect
you
without
envy
I
prove
my
dignity
as
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
if
they
do
n't
say
this
-LRB-
for
they
do
n't
know
how
to
say
this
yet
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
is
how
they
act
.
I
have
seen
it
myself
,
I
have
known
it
myself
,
and
,
*NL*
would
you
believe
it
,
the
poorer
our
Russian
peasant
is
,
the
more
*NL*
noticeable
is
that
serene
goodness
,
for
the
rich
among
them
are
for
the
*NL*
most
part
corrupted
already
,
and
much
of
that
is
due
to
our
carelessness
*NL*
and
indifference
.
But
God
will
save
His
people
,
for
Russia
is
great
in
her
*NL*
humility
.
I
dream
of
seeing
,
and
seem
to
see
clearly
already
,
our
future
.
*NL*
It
will
come
to
pass
,
that
even
the
most
corrupt
of
our
rich
will
end
by
*NL*
being
ashamed
of
his
riches
before
the
poor
,
and
the
poor
,
seeing
his
*NL*
humility
,
will
understand
and
give
way
before
him
,
will
respond
joyfully
*NL*
and
kindly
to
his
honorable
shame
.
Believe
me
that
it
will
end
in
that
;
*NL*
things
are
moving
to
that
.
Equality
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
spiritual
*NL*
dignity
of
man
,
and
that
will
only
be
understood
among
us
.
If
we
were
*NL*
brothers
,
there
would
be
fraternity
,
but
before
that
,
they
will
never
*NL*
agree
about
the
division
of
wealth
.
We
preserve
the
image
of
Christ
,
and
*NL*
it
will
shine
forth
like
a
precious
diamond
to
the
whole
world
.
So
may
it
*NL*
be
,
so
may
it
be
!
*NL*
*NL*
Fathers
and
teachers
,
a
touching
incident
befell
me
once
.
In
my
wanderings
*NL*
I
met
in
the
town
of
K.
my
old
orderly
,
Afanasy
.
It
was
eight
years
since
*NL*
I
had
parted
from
him
.
He
chanced
to
see
me
in
the
market-place
,
*NL*
recognized
me
,
ran
up
to
me
,
and
how
delighted
he
was
!
He
simply
pounced
*NL*
on
me
:
``
Master
dear
,
is
it
you
?
Is
it
really
you
I
see
?
''
He
took
me
home
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
longer
in
the
army
,
he
was
married
and
already
had
two
little
*NL*
children
.
He
and
his
wife
earned
their
living
as
costermongers
in
the
*NL*
market-place
.
His
room
was
poor
,
but
bright
and
clean
.
He
made
me
sit
*NL*
down
,
set
the
samovar
,
sent
for
his
wife
,
as
though
my
appearance
were
a
*NL*
festival
for
them
.
He
brought
me
his
children
:
``
Bless
them
,
Father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
for
me
to
bless
them
?
I
am
only
a
humble
monk
.
I
will
pray
for
*NL*
them
.
And
for
you
,
Afanasy
Pavlovitch
,
I
have
prayed
every
day
since
that
*NL*
day
,
for
it
all
came
from
you
,
''
said
I.
And
I
explained
that
to
him
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
.
And
what
do
you
think
?
The
man
kept
gazing
at
me
and
*NL*
could
not
believe
that
I
,
his
former
master
,
an
officer
,
was
now
before
*NL*
him
in
such
a
guise
and
position
;
it
made
him
shed
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
weeping
?
''
said
I
,
``
better
rejoice
over
me
,
dear
friend
,
whom
*NL*
I
can
never
forget
,
for
my
path
is
a
glad
and
joyful
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
say
much
,
but
kept
sighing
and
shaking
his
head
over
me
*NL*
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
became
of
your
fortune
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
it
to
the
monastery
,
''
I
answered
;
``
we
live
in
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
I
began
saying
good-by
,
and
suddenly
he
brought
out
half
a
*NL*
rouble
as
an
offering
to
the
monastery
,
and
another
half-rouble
I
saw
him
*NL*
thrusting
hurriedly
into
my
hand
:
``
That
's
for
you
in
your
wanderings
,
it
*NL*
may
be
of
use
to
you
,
Father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
his
half-rouble
,
bowed
to
him
and
his
wife
,
and
went
out
rejoicing
.
*NL*
And
on
my
way
I
thought
:
``
Here
we
are
both
now
,
he
at
home
and
I
on
the
*NL*
road
,
sighing
and
shaking
our
heads
,
no
doubt
,
and
yet
smiling
joyfully
in
*NL*
the
gladness
of
our
hearts
,
remembering
how
God
brought
about
our
*NL*
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
seen
him
again
since
then
.
I
had
been
his
master
and
he
my
*NL*
servant
,
but
now
when
we
exchanged
a
loving
kiss
with
softened
hearts
,
*NL*
there
was
a
great
human
bond
between
us
.
I
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
*NL*
that
,
and
now
what
I
think
is
this
:
Is
it
so
inconceivable
that
that
grand
*NL*
and
simple-hearted
unity
might
in
due
time
become
universal
among
the
*NL*
Russian
people
?
I
believe
that
it
will
come
to
pass
and
that
the
time
is
*NL*
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
of
servants
I
will
add
this
:
In
old
days
when
I
was
young
I
was
often
*NL*
angry
with
servants
;
``
the
cook
had
served
something
too
hot
,
the
orderly
*NL*
had
not
brushed
my
clothes
.
''
But
what
taught
me
better
then
was
a
thought
*NL*
of
my
dear
brother
's
,
which
I
had
heard
from
him
in
childhood
:
``
Am
I
worth
*NL*
it
,
that
another
should
serve
me
and
be
ordered
about
by
me
in
his
poverty
*NL*
and
ignorance
?
''
And
I
wondered
at
the
time
that
such
simple
and
self
-
*NL*
evident
ideas
should
be
so
slow
to
occur
to
our
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
that
there
should
be
no
servants
in
the
world
,
but
act
so
*NL*
that
your
servant
may
be
freer
in
spirit
than
if
he
were
not
a
servant
.
*NL*
And
why
can
not
I
be
a
servant
to
my
servant
and
even
let
him
see
it
,
and
*NL*
that
without
any
pride
on
my
part
or
any
mistrust
on
his
?
Why
should
not
*NL*
my
servant
be
like
my
own
kindred
,
so
that
I
may
take
him
into
my
family
*NL*
and
rejoice
in
doing
so
?
Even
now
this
can
be
done
,
but
it
will
lead
to
*NL*
the
grand
unity
of
men
in
the
future
,
when
a
man
will
not
seek
servants
*NL*
for
himself
,
or
desire
to
turn
his
fellow
creatures
into
servants
as
he
*NL*
does
now
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
will
long
with
his
whole
heart
to
be
the
*NL*
servant
of
all
,
as
the
Gospel
teaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
can
it
be
a
dream
,
that
in
the
end
man
will
find
his
joy
only
in
deeds
*NL*
of
light
and
mercy
,
and
not
in
cruel
pleasures
as
now
,
in
gluttony
,
*NL*
fornication
,
ostentation
,
boasting
and
envious
rivalry
of
one
with
the
*NL*
other
?
I
firmly
believe
that
it
is
not
and
that
the
time
is
at
hand
.
*NL*
People
laugh
and
ask
:
``
When
will
that
time
come
and
does
it
look
like
*NL*
coming
?
''
I
believe
that
with
Christ
's
help
we
shall
accomplish
this
great
*NL*
thing
.
And
how
many
ideas
there
have
been
on
earth
in
the
history
of
man
*NL*
which
were
unthinkable
ten
years
before
they
appeared
!
Yet
when
their
*NL*
destined
hour
had
come
,
they
came
forth
and
spread
over
the
whole
earth
.
*NL*
So
it
will
be
with
us
,
and
our
people
will
shine
forth
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
all
men
will
say
:
``
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
has
become
the
*NL*
corner-stone
of
the
building
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
may
ask
the
scornful
themselves
:
If
our
hope
is
a
dream
,
when
will
*NL*
you
build
up
your
edifice
and
order
things
justly
by
your
intellect
alone
,
*NL*
without
Christ
?
If
they
declare
that
it
is
they
who
are
advancing
towards
*NL*
unity
,
only
the
most
simple-hearted
among
them
believe
it
,
so
that
one
may
*NL*
positively
marvel
at
such
simplicity
.
Of
a
truth
,
they
have
more
fantastic
*NL*
dreams
than
we
.
They
aim
at
justice
,
but
,
denying
Christ
,
they
will
end
by
*NL*
flooding
the
earth
with
blood
,
for
blood
cries
out
for
blood
,
and
he
that
*NL*
taketh
up
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
.
And
if
it
were
not
for
*NL*
Christ
's
covenant
,
they
would
slaughter
one
another
down
to
the
last
two
*NL*
men
on
earth
.
And
those
two
last
men
would
not
be
able
to
restrain
each
*NL*
other
in
their
pride
,
and
the
one
would
slay
the
other
and
then
himself
.
*NL*
And
that
would
come
to
pass
,
were
it
not
for
the
promise
of
Christ
that
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
the
humble
and
meek
the
days
shall
be
shortened
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
still
wearing
an
officer
's
uniform
after
my
duel
,
I
talked
*NL*
about
servants
in
general
society
,
and
I
remember
every
one
was
amazed
at
*NL*
me
.
``
What
!
''
they
asked
,
``
are
we
to
make
our
servants
sit
down
on
the
sofa
*NL*
and
offer
them
tea
?
''
And
I
answered
them
:
``
Why
not
,
sometimes
at
least
?
''
*NL*
Every
one
laughed
.
Their
question
was
frivolous
and
my
answer
was
not
*NL*
clear
;
but
the
thought
in
it
was
to
some
extent
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-

Of

Love
,
and

Contact
with

_
*NL*
*NL*
Young
man
,
be
not
forgetful
of
prayer
.
Every
time
you
pray
,
if
your
prayer
*NL*
is
sincere
,
there
will
be
new
feeling
and
new
meaning
in
it
,
which
will
*NL*
give
you
fresh
courage
,
and
you
will
understand
that
prayer
is
an
*NL*
education
.
Remember
,
too
,
every
day
,
and
whenever
you
can
,
repeat
to
*NL*
yourself
,
``
Lord
,
have
mercy
on
all
who
appear
before
Thee
to-day
.
''
For
*NL*
every
hour
and
every
moment
thousands
of
men
leave
life
on
this
earth
,
and
*NL*
their
souls
appear
before
God
.
And
how
many
of
them
depart
in
solitude
,
*NL*
unknown
,
sad
,
dejected
that
no
one
mourns
for
them
or
even
knows
whether
*NL*
they
have
lived
or
not
!
And
behold
,
from
the
other
end
of
the
earth
*NL*
perhaps
,
your
prayer
for
their
rest
will
rise
up
to
God
though
you
knew
*NL*
them
not
nor
they
you
.
How
touching
it
must
be
to
a
soul
standing
in
dread
*NL*
before
the
Lord
to
feel
at
that
instant
that
,
for
him
too
,
there
is
one
to
*NL*
pray
,
that
there
is
a
fellow
creature
left
on
earth
to
love
him
too
!
And
*NL*
God
will
look
on
you
both
more
graciously
,
for
if
you
have
had
so
much
*NL*
pity
on
him
,
how
much
will
He
have
pity
Who
is
infinitely
more
loving
and
*NL*
merciful
than
you
!
And
He
will
forgive
him
for
your
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brothers
,
have
no
fear
of
men
's
sin
.
Love
a
man
even
in
his
sin
,
for
that
*NL*
is
the
semblance
of
Divine
Love
and
is
the
highest
love
on
earth
.
Love
all
*NL*
God
's
creation
,
the
whole
and
every
grain
of
sand
in
it
.
Love
every
leaf
,
*NL*
every
ray
of
God
's
light
.
Love
the
animals
,
love
the
plants
,
love
*NL*
everything
.
If
you
love
everything
,
you
will
perceive
the
divine
mystery
*NL*
in
things
.
Once
you
perceive
it
,
you
will
begin
to
comprehend
it
better
*NL*
every
day
.
And
you
will
come
at
last
to
love
the
whole
world
with
an
all
-
*NL*
embracing
love
.
Love
the
animals
:
God
has
given
them
the
rudiments
of
*NL*
thought
and
joy
untroubled
.
Do
not
trouble
it
,
do
n't
harass
them
,
do
n't
*NL*
deprive
them
of
their
happiness
,
do
n't
work
against
God
's
intent
.
Man
,
do
*NL*
not
pride
yourself
on
superiority
to
the
animals
;
they
are
without
sin
,
*NL*
and
you
,
with
your
greatness
,
defile
the
earth
by
your
appearance
on
it
,
*NL*
and
leave
the
traces
of
your
foulness
after
you
--
alas
,
it
is
true
of
almost
*NL*
every
one
of
us
!
Love
children
especially
,
for
they
too
are
sinless
like
*NL*
the
angels
;
they
live
to
soften
and
purify
our
hearts
and
as
it
were
to
*NL*
guide
us
.
Woe
to
him
who
offends
a
child
!
Father
Anfim
taught
me
to
love
*NL*
children
.
The
kind
,
silent
man
used
often
on
our
wanderings
to
spend
the
*NL*
farthings
given
us
on
sweets
and
cakes
for
the
children
.
He
could
not
pass
*NL*
by
a
child
without
emotion
.
That
's
the
nature
of
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
some
thoughts
one
stands
perplexed
,
especially
at
the
sight
of
men
's
*NL*
sin
,
and
wonders
whether
one
should
use
force
or
humble
love
.
Always
*NL*
decide
to
use
humble
love
.
If
you
resolve
on
that
once
for
all
,
you
may
*NL*
subdue
the
whole
world
.
Loving
humility
is
marvelously
strong
,
the
*NL*
strongest
of
all
things
,
and
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
and
every
hour
,
every
minute
,
walk
round
yourself
and
watch
*NL*
yourself
,
and
see
that
your
image
is
a
seemly
one
.
You
pass
by
a
little
*NL*
child
,
you
pass
by
,
spiteful
,
with
ugly
words
,
with
wrathful
heart
;
you
*NL*
may
not
have
noticed
the
child
,
but
he
has
seen
you
,
and
your
image
,
*NL*
unseemly
and
ignoble
,
may
remain
in
his
defenseless
heart
.
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
it
,
but
you
may
have
sown
an
evil
seed
in
him
and
it
may
grow
,
and
all
*NL*
because
you
were
not
careful
before
the
child
,
because
you
did
not
foster
*NL*
in
yourself
a
careful
,
actively
benevolent
love
.
Brothers
,
love
is
a
*NL*
teacher
;
but
one
must
know
how
to
acquire
it
,
for
it
is
hard
to
acquire
,
*NL*
it
is
dearly
bought
,
it
is
won
slowly
by
long
labor
.
For
we
must
love
not
*NL*
only
occasionally
,
for
a
moment
,
but
for
ever
.
Every
one
can
love
*NL*
occasionally
,
even
the
wicked
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother
asked
the
birds
to
forgive
him
;
that
sounds
senseless
,
but
it
*NL*
is
right
;
for
all
is
like
an
ocean
,
all
is
flowing
and
blending
;
a
touch
*NL*
in
one
place
sets
up
movement
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
.
It
may
be
*NL*
senseless
to
beg
forgiveness
of
the
birds
,
but
birds
would
be
happier
at
*NL*
your
side
--
a
little
happier
,
anyway
--
and
children
and
all
animals
,
if
you
*NL*
were
nobler
than
you
are
now
.
It
's
all
like
an
ocean
,
I
tell
you
.
Then
you
*NL*
would
pray
to
the
birds
too
,
consumed
by
an
all-embracing
love
,
in
a
sort
*NL*
of
transport
,
and
pray
that
they
too
will
forgive
you
your
sin
.
Treasure
*NL*
this
ecstasy
,
however
senseless
it
may
seem
to
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
friends
,
pray
to
God
for
gladness
.
Be
glad
as
children
,
as
the
birds
of
*NL*
heaven
.
And
let
not
the
sin
of
men
confound
you
in
your
doings
.
Fear
not
*NL*
that
it
will
wear
away
your
work
and
hinder
its
being
accomplished
.
Do
not
*NL*
say
,
``
Sin
is
mighty
,
wickedness
is
mighty
,
evil
environment
is
mighty
,
and
*NL*
we
are
lonely
and
helpless
,
and
evil
environment
is
wearing
us
away
and
*NL*
hindering
our
good
work
from
being
done
.
''
Fly
from
that
dejection
,
*NL*
children
!
There
is
only
one
means
of
salvation
,
then
take
yourself
and
*NL*
make
yourself
responsible
for
all
men
's
sins
,
that
is
the
truth
,
you
know
,
*NL*
friends
,
for
as
soon
as
you
sincerely
make
yourself
responsible
for
*NL*
everything
and
for
all
men
,
you
will
see
at
once
that
it
is
really
so
,
and
*NL*
that
you
are
to
blame
for
every
one
and
for
all
things
.
But
throwing
your
*NL*
own
indolence
and
impotence
on
others
you
will
end
by
sharing
the
pride
of
*NL*
Satan
and
murmuring
against
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
pride
of
Satan
what
I
think
is
this
:
it
is
hard
for
us
on
earth
to
*NL*
comprehend
it
,
and
therefore
it
is
so
easy
to
fall
into
error
and
to
share
*NL*
it
,
even
imagining
that
we
are
doing
something
grand
and
fine
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
many
of
the
strongest
feelings
and
movements
of
our
nature
we
can
not
*NL*
comprehend
on
earth
.
Let
not
that
be
a
stumbling-block
,
and
think
not
that
*NL*
it
may
serve
as
a
justification
to
you
for
anything
.
For
the
Eternal
Judge
*NL*
asks
of
you
what
you
can
comprehend
and
not
what
you
can
not
.
You
will
know
*NL*
that
yourself
hereafter
,
for
you
will
behold
all
things
truly
then
and
*NL*
will
not
dispute
them
.
On
earth
,
indeed
,
we
are
as
it
were
astray
,
and
if
*NL*
it
were
not
for
the
precious
image
of
Christ
before
us
,
we
should
be
*NL*
undone
and
altogether
lost
,
as
was
the
human
race
before
the
flood
.
Much
*NL*
on
earth
is
hidden
from
us
,
but
to
make
up
for
that
we
have
been
given
a
*NL*
precious
mystic
sense
of
our
living
bond
with
the
other
world
,
with
the
*NL*
higher
heavenly
world
,
and
the
roots
of
our
thoughts
and
feelings
are
not
*NL*
here
but
in
other
worlds
.
That
is
why
the
philosophers
say
that
we
can
not
*NL*
apprehend
the
reality
of
things
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
took
seeds
from
different
worlds
and
sowed
them
on
this
earth
,
and
His
*NL*
garden
grew
up
and
everything
came
up
that
could
come
up
,
but
what
grows
*NL*
lives
and
is
alive
only
through
the
feeling
of
its
contact
with
other
*NL*
mysterious
worlds
.
If
that
feeling
grows
weak
or
is
destroyed
in
you
,
the
*NL*
heavenly
growth
will
die
away
in
you
.
Then
you
will
be
indifferent
to
life
*NL*
and
even
grow
to
hate
it
.
That
's
what
I
think
.

Faith
to

End
_
*NL*
*NL*
Remember
particularly
that
you
can
not
be
a
judge
of
any
one
.
For
no
one
*NL*
can
judge
a
criminal
,
until
he
recognizes
that
he
is
just
such
a
criminal
*NL*
as
the
man
standing
before
him
,
and
that
he
perhaps
is
more
than
all
men
*NL*
to
blame
for
that
crime
.
When
he
understands
that
,
he
will
be
able
to
be
a
*NL*
judge
.
Though
that
sounds
absurd
,
it
is
true
.
If
I
had
been
righteous
*NL*
myself
,
perhaps
there
would
have
been
no
criminal
standing
before
me
.
If
*NL*
you
can
take
upon
yourself
the
crime
of
the
criminal
your
heart
is
*NL*
judging
,
take
it
at
once
,
suffer
for
him
yourself
,
and
let
him
go
without
*NL*
reproach
.
And
even
if
the
law
itself
makes
you
his
judge
,
act
in
the
same
*NL*
spirit
so
far
as
possible
,
for
he
will
go
away
and
condemn
himself
more
*NL*
bitterly
than
you
have
done
.
If
,
after
your
kiss
,
he
goes
away
untouched
,
*NL*
mocking
at
you
,
do
not
let
that
be
a
stumbling-block
to
you
.
It
shows
his
*NL*
time
has
not
yet
come
,
but
it
will
come
in
due
course
.
And
if
it
come
not
,
*NL*
no
matter
;
if
not
he
,
then
another
in
his
place
will
understand
and
*NL*
suffer
,
and
judge
and
condemn
himself
,
and
the
truth
will
be
fulfilled
.
*NL*
Believe
that
,
believe
it
without
doubt
;
for
in
that
lies
all
the
hope
and
*NL*
faith
of
the
saints
.
*NL*
*NL*
Work
without
ceasing
.
If
you
remember
in
the
night
as
you
go
to
sleep
,
``
I
*NL*
have
not
done
what
I
ought
to
have
done
,
''
rise
up
at
once
and
do
it
.
If
*NL*
the
people
around
you
are
spiteful
and
callous
and
will
not
hear
you
,
fall
*NL*
down
before
them
and
beg
their
forgiveness
;
for
in
truth
you
are
to
blame
*NL*
for
their
not
wanting
to
hear
you
.
And
if
you
can
not
speak
to
them
in
*NL*
their
bitterness
,
serve
them
in
silence
and
in
humility
,
never
losing
*NL*
hope
.
If
all
men
abandon
you
and
even
drive
you
away
by
force
,
then
when
*NL*
you
are
left
alone
fall
on
the
earth
and
kiss
it
,
water
it
with
your
tears
*NL*
and
it
will
bring
forth
fruit
even
though
no
one
has
seen
or
heard
you
in
*NL*
your
solitude
.
Believe
to
the
end
,
even
if
all
men
went
astray
and
you
*NL*
were
left
the
only
one
faithful
;
bring
your
offering
even
then
and
praise
*NL*
God
in
your
loneliness
.
And
if
two
of
you
are
gathered
together
--
then
there
*NL*
is
a
whole
world
,
a
world
of
living
love
.
Embrace
each
other
tenderly
and
*NL*
praise
God
,
for
if
only
in
you
two
His
truth
has
been
fulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
sin
yourself
and
grieve
even
unto
death
for
your
sins
or
for
your
*NL*
sudden
sin
,
then
rejoice
for
others
,
rejoice
for
the
righteous
man
,
*NL*
rejoice
that
if
you
have
sinned
,
he
is
righteous
and
has
not
sinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
evil-doing
of
men
moves
you
to
indignation
and
overwhelming
*NL*
distress
,
even
to
a
desire
for
vengeance
on
the
evil-doers
,
shun
above
all
*NL*
things
that
feeling
.
Go
at
once
and
seek
suffering
for
yourself
,
as
though
*NL*
you
were
yourself
guilty
of
that
wrong
.
Accept
that
suffering
and
bear
it
*NL*
and
your
heart
will
find
comfort
,
and
you
will
understand
that
you
too
are
*NL*
guilty
,
for
you
might
have
been
a
light
to
the
evil-doers
,
even
as
the
one
*NL*
man
sinless
,
and
you
were
not

If
you
had
been

*NL*
you
would
have
lightened
the
path
for
others
too
,
and
the
evil-doer
might
*NL*
perhaps
have
been
saved
by
your
light
from
his
sin
.
And
even
though
your
*NL*
light
was
shining
,
yet
you
see
men
were
not
saved
by
it
,
hold
firm
and
*NL*
doubt
not
the
power
of
the
heavenly
light
.
Believe
that
if
they
were
not
*NL*
saved
,
they
will
be
saved
hereafter
.
And
if
they
are
not
saved
hereafter

then
their
sons
will
be
saved
,
for
your

will
not
die

The
righteous
man
departs
,
but
his
light
remains

Men
are
always

saved
after
the
death
of
the
deliverer

Men
reject
their

and
slay
*NL*
them
,
but
they
love
their
martyrs
and
honor
those
whom
they
have
slain
.
*NL*
You
are
working
for

you
are
acting
for

Seek
no

reward

for
great
is
your
reward
on
this

:
the
spiritual
joy
which
is

only
vouchsafed
to

Fear
not

Of

a
Mystic
Reflection
_
*NL*
*NL*
Fathers
and
teachers
,
I
ponder
,
``
What
is
hell
?
''
I
maintain
that
it
is
the
*NL*
suffering
of
being
unable
to
love
.
Once
in
infinite
existence
,
*NL*
immeasurable
in
time
and
space
,
a
spiritual
creature
was
given
on
his
*NL*
coming
to
earth
,
the
power
of
saying
,
``
I
am
and
I
love
.
''
Once
,
only
once
,
*NL*
there
was
given
him
a
moment
of
active
_
living
_
love
,
and
for
that
was
*NL*
earthly
life
given
him
,
and
with
it
times
and
seasons
.
And
that
happy
*NL*
creature
rejected
the
priceless
gift
,
prized
it
and
loved
it
not
,
scorned
*NL*
it
and
remained
callous
.
Such
a
one
,
having
left
the
earth
,
sees
Abraham
's
*NL*
bosom
and
talks
with
Abraham
as
we
are
told
in
the
parable
of
the
rich
man
*NL*
and
Lazarus
,
and
beholds
heaven
and
can
go
up
to
the
Lord
.
But
that
is
*NL*
just
his
torment
,
to
rise
up
to
the
Lord
without
ever
having
loved
,
to
be
*NL*
brought
close
to
those
who
have
loved
when
he
has
despised
their
love
.
For
*NL*
he
sees
clearly
and
says
to
himself
,
``
Now
I
have
understanding
,
and
though
*NL*
I
now
thirst
to
love
,
there
will
be
nothing
great
,
no
sacrifice
in
my
*NL*
love
,
for
my
earthly
life
is
over
,
and
Abraham
will
not
come
even
with
a
*NL*
drop
of
living
water
-LRB-
that
is
the
gift
of
earthly

life

burns
in
me
now
,
though
I
despised
it
*NL*
on
earth
;
there
is
no
more
life
for
me
and
will
be
no
more
time
!
Even
*NL*
though
I
would
gladly
give
my
life
for
others
,
it
can
never
be
,
for
that
*NL*
life
is
passed
which
can
be
sacrificed
for
love
,
and
now
there
is
a
gulf
*NL*
fixed
between
that
life
and
this
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
talk
of
hell
fire
in
the
material
sense
.
I
do
n't
go
into
that
mystery
*NL*
and
I
shun
it
.
But
I
think
if
there
were
fire
in
material
sense
,
they
*NL*
would
be
glad
of
it
,
for
I
imagine
that
in
material
agony
,
their
still
*NL*
greater
spiritual
agony
would
be
forgotten
for
a
moment
.
Moreover
,
that
*NL*
spiritual
agony
can
not
be
taken
from
them
,
for
that
suffering
is
not
*NL*
external
but
within
them
.
And
if
it
could
be
taken
from
them
,
I
think
it
*NL*
would
be
bitterer
still
for
the
unhappy
creatures
.
For
even
if
the
*NL*
righteous
in
Paradise
forgave
them
,
beholding
their
torments
,
and
called
*NL*
them
up
to
heaven
in
their
infinite
love
,
they
would
only
multiply
their
*NL*
torments
,
for
they
would
arouse
in
them
still
more
keenly
a
flaming
thirst
*NL*
for
responsive
,
active
and
grateful
love
which
is
now
impossible
.
In
the
*NL*
timidity
of
my
heart
I
imagine
,
however
,
that
the
very
recognition
of
this
*NL*
impossibility
would
serve
at
last
to
console
them
.
For
accepting
the
love
*NL*
of
the
righteous
together
with
the
impossibility
of
repaying
it
,
by
this
*NL*
submissiveness
and
the
effect
of
this
humility
,
they
will
attain
at
last
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
to
a
certain
semblance
of
that
active
love
which
they
scorned
*NL*
in
life
,
to
something
like
its
outward
expression
...
I
am
sorry
,
friends
*NL*
and
brothers
,
that
I
can
not
express
this
clearly
.
But
woe
to
those
who
*NL*
have
slain
themselves
on
earth
,
woe
to
the
suicides
!
I
believe
that
there
*NL*
can
be
none
more
miserable
then
they
.
They
tell
us
that
it
is
a
sin
to
*NL*
pray
for
them
and
outwardly
the
Church
,
as
it
were
,
renounces
them
,
but
in
*NL*
my
secret
heart
I
believe
that
we
may
pray
even
for
them
.
Love
can
never
*NL*
be
an
offense
to
Christ
.
For
such
as
those
I
have
prayed
inwardly
all
my
*NL*
life
,
I
confess
it
,
fathers
and
teachers
,
and
even
now
I
pray
for
them
*NL*
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
there
are
some
who
remain
proud
and
fierce
even
in
hell
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
their
certain
knowledge
and
contemplation
of
the
absolute
truth
;
there
are
*NL*
some
fearful
ones
who
have
given
themselves
over
to
Satan
and
his
proud
*NL*
spirit
entirely
.
For
such
,
hell
is
voluntary
and
ever
consuming
;
they
are
*NL*
tortured
by
their
own
choice
.
For
they
have
cursed
themselves
,
cursing
God
*NL*
and
life
.
They
live
upon
their
vindictive
pride
like
a
starving
man
in
the
*NL*
desert
sucking
blood
out
of
his
own
body
.
But
they
are
never
satisfied
,
*NL*
and
they
refuse
forgiveness
,
they
curse
God
Who
calls
them
.
They
can
not
*NL*
behold
the
living
God
without
hatred
,
and
they
cry
out
that
the
God
of
*NL*
life
should
be
annihilated
,
that
God
should
destroy
Himself
and
His
own
*NL*
creation
.
And
they
will
burn
in
the
fire
of
their
own
wrath
for
ever
and
*NL*
yearn
for
death
and
annihilation
.
But
they
will
not
attain
to
death
...

Here
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
's
manuscript
ends
.
I
repeat
,
it
is
*NL*
incomplete
and
fragmentary
.
Biographical
details
,
for
instance
,
cover
only
*NL*
Father
Zossima
's
earliest
youth
.
Of
his
teaching
and
opinions
we
find
*NL*
brought
together
sayings
evidently
uttered
on
very
different
occasions
.
*NL*
His
utterances
during
the
last
few
hours
have
not
been
kept
separate
from
*NL*
the
rest
,
but
their
general
character
can
be
gathered
from
what
we
have
in
*NL*
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
's
manuscript
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
's
death
came
in
the
end
quite
unexpectedly
.
For
although
those
*NL*
who
were
gathered
about
him
that
last
evening
realized
that
his
death
was
*NL*
approaching
,
yet
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
it
would
come
so
*NL*
suddenly
.
On
the
contrary
,
his
friends
,
as
I
observed
already
,
seeing
him
*NL*
that
night
apparently
so
cheerful
and
talkative
,
were
convinced
that
there
*NL*
was
at
least
a
temporary
change
for
the
better
in
his
condition
.
Even
five
*NL*
minutes
before
his
death
,
they
said
afterwards
wonderingly
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
foresee
it
.
He
seemed
suddenly
to
feel
an
acute
pain
in
his
*NL*
chest
,
he
turned
pale
and
pressed
his
hands
to
his
heart
.
All
rose
from
*NL*
their
seats
and
hastened
to
him
.
But
though
suffering
,
he
still
looked
at
*NL*
them
with
a
smile
,
sank
slowly
from
his
chair
on
to
his
knees
,
then
bowed
*NL*
his
face
to
the
ground
,
stretched
out
his
arms
and
as
though
in
joyful
*NL*
ecstasy
,
praying
and
kissing
the
ground
,
quietly
and
joyfully
gave
up
his
*NL*
soul
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
his
death
spread
at
once
through
the
hermitage
and
reached
the
*NL*
monastery
.
The
nearest
friends
of
the
deceased
and
those
whose
duty
it
was
*NL*
from
their
position
began
to
lay
out
the
corpse
according
to
the
ancient
*NL*
ritual
,
and
all
the
monks
gathered
together
in
the
church
.
And
before
dawn
*NL*
the
news
of
the
death
reached
the
town
.
By
the
morning
all
the
town
was
*NL*
talking
of
the
event
,
and
crowds
were
flocking
from
the
town
to
the
*NL*
monastery
.
But
this
subject
will
be
treated
in
the
next
book
;
I
will
only
*NL*
add
here
that
before
a
day
had
passed
something
happened
so
unexpected
,
so
*NL*
strange
,
upsetting
,
and
bewildering
in
its
effect
on
the
monks
and
the
*NL*
townspeople
,
that
after
all
these
years
,
that
day
of
general
suspense
is
*NL*
still
vividly
remembered
in
the
town
.

Chapter
I
.
The
Breath
Of
Corruption
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
body
of
Father
Zossima
was
prepared
for
burial
according
to
the
*NL*
established
ritual
.
As
is
well
known
,
the
bodies
of
dead
monks
and
hermits
*NL*
are
not
washed
.
In
the
words
of
the
Church
Ritual
:
``
If
any
one
of
the
*NL*
monks
depart
in
the
Lord
,
the
monk
designated
-LRB-
that
is
,
whose
office
it
*NL*
is
-RRB-
shall
wipe
the
body
with
warm
water
,
making
first
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
cross
with
a
sponge
on
the
forehead
of
the
deceased
,
on
the
breast
,
on
the
*NL*
hands
and
feet
and
on
the
knees
,
and
that
is
enough
.
''
All
this
was
done
by
*NL*
Father
Paissy
,
who
then
clothed
the
deceased
in
his
monastic
garb
and
*NL*
wrapped
him
in
his
cloak
,
which
was
,
according
to
custom
,
somewhat
slit
to
*NL*
allow
of
its
being
folded
about
him
in
the
form
of
a
cross
.
On
his
head
he
*NL*
put
a
hood
with
an
eight-cornered
cross
.
The
hood
was
left
open
and
the
*NL*
dead
man
's
face
was
covered
with
black
gauze
.
In
his
hands
was
put
an
ikon
*NL*
of
the
Saviour
.
Towards
morning
he
was
put
in
the
coffin
which
had
been
*NL*
made
ready
long
before
.
It
was
decided
to
leave
the
coffin
all
day
in
the
*NL*
cell
,
in
the
larger
room
in
which
the
elder
used
to
receive
his
visitors
*NL*
and
fellow
monks
.
As
the
deceased
was
a
priest
and
monk
of
the
strictest
*NL*
rule
,
the
Gospel
,
not
the
Psalter
,
had
to
be
read
over
his
body
by
monks
*NL*
in
holy
orders
.
The
reading
was
begun
by
Father
Iosif
immediately
after
*NL*
the
requiem
service
.
Father
Paissy
desired
later
on
to
read
the
Gospel
all
*NL*
day
and
night
over
his
dead
friend
,
but
for
the
present
he
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
Father
Superintendent
of
the
Hermitage
,
was
very
busy
and
occupied
,
for
*NL*
something
extraordinary
,
an
unheard-of
,
even
``
unseemly
''
excitement
and
*NL*
impatient
expectation
began
to
be
apparent
in
the
monks
,
and
the
visitors
*NL*
from
the
monastery
hostels
,
and
the
crowds
of
people
flocking
from
the
*NL*
town
.
And
as
time
went
on
,
this
grew
more
and
more
marked
.
Both
the
*NL*
Superintendent
and
Father
Paissy
did
their
utmost
to
calm
the
general
*NL*
bustle
and
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
fully
daylight
,
some
people
began
bringing
their
sick
,
in
most
*NL*
cases
children
,
with
them
from
the
town
--
as
though
they
had
been
waiting
*NL*
expressly
for
this
moment
to
do
so
,
evidently
persuaded
that
the
dead
*NL*
elder
's
remains
had
a
power
of
healing
,
which
would
be
immediately
made
*NL*
manifest
in
accordance
with
their
faith
.
It
was
only
then
apparent
how
*NL*
unquestionably
every
one
in
our
town
had
accepted
Father
Zossima
during
*NL*
his
lifetime
as
a
great
saint
.
And
those
who
came
were
far
from
being
all
*NL*
of
the
humbler
classes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
intense
expectation
on
the
part
of
believers
displayed
with
such
*NL*
haste
,
such
openness
,
even
with
impatience
and
almost
insistence
,
*NL*
impressed
Father
Paissy
as
unseemly
.
Though
he
had
long
foreseen
something
*NL*
of
the
sort
,
the
actual
manifestation
of
the
feeling
was
beyond
anything
*NL*
he
had
looked
for
.
When
he
came
across
any
of
the
monks
who
displayed
this
*NL*
excitement
,
Father
Paissy
began
to
reprove
them
.
``
Such
immediate
*NL*
expectation
of
something
extraordinary
,
''
he
said
,
``
shows
a
levity
,
*NL*
possible
to
worldly
people
but
unseemly
in
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
little
attention
was
paid
him
and
Father
Paissy
noticed
it
uneasily
.
*NL*
Yet
he
himself
-LRB-
if
the
whole
truth
must
be
told
-RRB-
,
secretly
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
his
heart
,
cherished
almost
the
same
hopes
and
could
not
but
be
aware
*NL*
of
it
,
though
he
was
indignant
at
the
too
impatient
expectation
around
*NL*
him
,
and
saw
in
it
light-mindedness
and
vanity
.
Nevertheless
,
it
was
*NL*
particularly
unpleasant
to
him
to
meet
certain
persons
,
whose
presence
*NL*
aroused
in
him
great
misgivings
.
In
the
crowd
in
the
dead
man
's
cell
he
*NL*
noticed
with
inward
aversion
-LRB-
for
which
he
immediately
reproached
himself
-RRB-
*NL*
the
presence
of
Rakitin
and
of
the
monk
from
Obdorsk
,
who
was
still
*NL*
staying
in
the
monastery
.
Of
both
of
them
Father
Paissy
felt
for
some
*NL*
reason
suddenly
suspicious
--
though
,
indeed
,
he
might
well
have
felt
the
*NL*
same
about
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monk
from
Obdorsk
was
conspicuous
as
the
most
fussy
in
the
excited
*NL*
crowd
.
He
was
to
be
seen
everywhere
;
everywhere
he
was
asking
questions
,
*NL*
everywhere
he
was
listening
,
on
all
sides
he
was
whispering
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
,
mysterious
air
.
His
expression
showed
the
greatest
impatience
*NL*
and
even
a
sort
of
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Rakitin
,
he
,
as
appeared
later
,
had
come
so
early
to
the
hermitage
*NL*
at
the
special
request
of
Madame
Hohlakov
.
As
soon
as
that
good-hearted
*NL*
but
weak-minded
woman
,
who
could
not
herself
have
been
admitted
to
the
*NL*
hermitage
,
waked
and
heard
of
the
death
of
Father
Zossima
,
she
was
*NL*
overtaken
with
such
intense
curiosity
that
she
promptly
dispatched
Rakitin
*NL*
to
the
hermitage
,
to
keep
a
careful
look
out
and
report
to
her
by
letter
*NL*
every
half-hour
or
so
''
_
everything
that
takes
place
_
.
''
She
regarded
*NL*
Rakitin
as
a
most
religious
and
devout
young
man
.
He
was
particularly
*NL*
clever
in
getting
round
people
and
assuming
whatever
part
he
thought
most
*NL*
to
their
taste
,
if
he
detected
the
slightest
advantage
to
himself
from
*NL*
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bright
,
clear
day
,
and
many
of
the
visitors
were
thronging
about
*NL*
the
tombs
,
which
were
particularly
numerous
round
the
church
and
scattered
*NL*
here
and
there
about
the
hermitage
.
As
he
walked
round
the
hermitage
,
*NL*
Father
Paissy
remembered
Alyosha
and
that
he
had
not
seen
him
for
some
*NL*
time
,
not
since
the
night
.
And
he
had
no
sooner
thought
of
him
than
he
at
*NL*
once
noticed
him
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
hermitage
garden
,
sitting
*NL*
on
the
tombstone
of
a
monk
who
had
been
famous
long
ago
for
his
*NL*
saintliness
.
He
sat
with
his
back
to
the
hermitage
and
his
face
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
seemed
to
be
hiding
behind
the
tombstone
.
Going
up
to
him
,
*NL*
Father
Paissy
saw
that
he
was
weeping
quietly
but
bitterly
,
with
his
face
*NL*
hidden
in
his
hands
,
and
that
his
whole
frame
was
shaking
with
sobs
.
*NL*
Father
Paissy
stood
over
him
for
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
dear
son
,
enough
,
dear
,
''
he
pronounced
with
feeling
at
last
.
``
Why
*NL*
do
you
weep
?
Rejoice
and
weep
not
.
Do
n't
you
know
that
this
is
the
*NL*
greatest
of
his
days
?
Think
only
where
he
is
now
,
at
this
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
glanced
at
him
,
uncovering
his
face
,
which
was
swollen
with
crying
*NL*
like
a
child
's
,
but
turned
away
at
once
without
uttering
a
word
and
hid
*NL*
his
face
in
his
hands
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
it
is
well
,
''
said
Father
Paissy
thoughtfully
;
``
weep
if
you
must
,
*NL*
Christ
has
sent
you
those
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
touching
tears
are
but
a
relief
to
your
spirit
and
will
serve
to
*NL*
gladden
your
dear
heart
,
''
he
added
to
himself
,
walking
away
from
Alyosha
,
*NL*
and
thinking
lovingly
of
him
.
He
moved
away
quickly
,
however
,
for
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
too
might
weep
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
time
was
passing
;
the
monastery
services
and
the
requiems
*NL*
for
the
dead
followed
in
their
due
course
.
Father
Paissy
again
took
Father
*NL*
Iosif
's
place
by
the
coffin
and
began
reading
the
Gospel
.
But
before
three
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
that
something
took
place
to
which
I
alluded
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
last
book
,
something
so
unexpected
by
all
of
us
and
so
*NL*
contrary
to
the
general
hope
,
that
,
I
repeat
,
this
trivial
incident
has
*NL*
been
minutely
remembered
to
this
day
in
our
town
and
all
the
surrounding
*NL*
neighborhood
.
I
may
add
here
,
for
myself
personally
,
that
I
feel
it
almost
*NL*
repulsive
to
recall
that
event
which
caused
such
frivolous
agitation
and
*NL*
was
such
a
stumbling-block
to
many
,
though
in
reality
it
was
the
most
*NL*
natural
and
trivial
matter
.
I
should
,
of
course
,
have
omitted
all
mention
*NL*
of
it
in
my
story
,
if
it
had
not
exerted
a
very
strong
influence
on
the
*NL*
heart
and
soul
of
the
chief
,
though
future
,
hero
of
my
story
,
Alyosha
,
*NL*
forming
a
crisis
and
turning-point
in
his
spiritual
development
,
giving
a
*NL*
shock
to
his
intellect
,
which
finally
strengthened
it
for
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
life
and
gave
it
a
definite
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
to
return
to
our
story
.
When
before
dawn
they
laid
Father
*NL*
Zossima
's
body
in
the
coffin
and
brought
it
into
the
front
room
,
the
*NL*
question
of
opening
the
windows
was
raised
among
those
who
were
around
the
*NL*
coffin
.
But
this
suggestion
made
casually
by
some
one
was
unanswered
and
*NL*
almost
unnoticed
.
Some
of
those
present
may
perhaps
have
inwardly
noticed
*NL*
it
,
only
to
reflect
that
the
anticipation
of
decay
and
corruption
from
the
*NL*
body
of
such
a
saint
was
an
actual
absurdity
,
calling
for
compassion
-LRB-
if
*NL*
not
a
smile
-RRB-
for
the
lack
of
faith
and
the
frivolity
it
implied
.
For
they
*NL*
expected
something
quite
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
behold
,
soon
after
midday
there
were
signs
of
something
,
at
first
*NL*
only
observed
in
silence
by
those
who
came
in
and
out
and
were
evidently
*NL*
each
afraid
to
communicate
the
thought
in
his
mind
.
But
by
three
o'clock
*NL*
those
signs
had
become
so
clear
and
unmistakable
,
that
the
news
swiftly
*NL*
reached
all
the
monks
and
visitors
in
the
hermitage
,
promptly
penetrated
*NL*
to
the
monastery
,
throwing
all
the
monks
into
amazement
,
and
finally
,
in
*NL*
the
shortest
possible
time
,
spread
to
the
town
,
exciting
every
one
in
it
,
*NL*
believers
and
unbelievers
alike
.
The
unbelievers
rejoiced
,
and
as
for
the
*NL*
believers
some
of
them
rejoiced
even
more
than
the
unbelievers
,
for
``
men
*NL*
love
the
downfall
and
disgrace
of
the
righteous
,
''
as
the
deceased
elder
*NL*
had
said
in
one
of
his
exhortations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
that
a
smell
of
decomposition
began
to
come
from
the
coffin
,
*NL*
growing
gradually
more
marked
,
and
by
three
o'clock
it
was
quite
*NL*
unmistakable
.
In
all
the
past
history
of
our
monastery
,
no
such
scandal
*NL*
could
be
recalled
,
and
in
no
other
circumstances
could
such
a
scandal
have
*NL*
been
possible
,
as
showed
itself
in
unseemly
disorder
immediately
after
*NL*
this
discovery
among
the
very
monks
themselves
.
Afterwards
,
even
many
*NL*
years
afterwards
,
some
sensible
monks
were
amazed
and
horrified
,
when
they
*NL*
recalled
that
day
,
that
the
scandal
could
have
reached
such
proportions
.
*NL*
For
in
the
past
,
monks
of
very
holy
life
had
died
,
God-fearing
old
men
,
*NL*
whose
saintliness
was
acknowledged
by
all
,
yet
from
their
humble
coffins
,
*NL*
too
,
the
breath
of
corruption
had
come
,
naturally
,
as
from
all
dead
*NL*
bodies
,
but
that
had
caused
no
scandal
nor
even
the
slightest
excitement
.
*NL*
Of
course
there
had
been
,
in
former
times
,
saints
in
the
monastery
whose
*NL*
memory
was
carefully
preserved
and
whose
relics
,
according
to
tradition
,
*NL*
showed
no
signs
of
corruption
.
This
fact
was
regarded
by
the
monks
as
*NL*
touching
and
mysterious
,
and
the
tradition
of
it
was
cherished
as
*NL*
something
blessed
and
miraculous
,
and
as
a
promise
,
by
God
's
grace
,
of
*NL*
still
greater
glory
from
their
tombs
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
such
,
whose
memory
was
particularly
cherished
,
was
an
old
monk
,
Job
,
*NL*
who
had
died
seventy
years
before
at
the
age
of
a
hundred
and
five
.
He
had
*NL*
been
a
celebrated
ascetic
,
rigid
in
fasting
and
silence
,
and
his
tomb
was
*NL*
pointed
out
to
all
visitors
on
their
arrival
with
peculiar
respect
and
*NL*
mysterious
hints
of
great
hopes
connected
with
it
.
-LRB-
That
was
the
very
tomb
*NL*
on
which
Father
Paissy
had
found
Alyosha
sitting
in
the
morning
.
-RRB-
Another
*NL*
memory
cherished
in
the
monastery
was
that
of
the
famous
Father
Varsonofy
,
*NL*
who
was
only
recently
dead
and
had
preceded
Father
Zossima
in
the
*NL*
eldership
.
He
was
reverenced
during
his
lifetime
as
a
crazy
saint
by
all
*NL*
the
pilgrims
to
the
monastery
.
There
was
a
tradition
that
both
of
these
*NL*
had
lain
in
their
coffins
as
though
alive
,
that
they
had
shown
no
signs
of
*NL*
decomposition
when
they
were
buried
and
that
there
had
been
a
holy
light
*NL*
in
their
faces
.
And
some
people
even
insisted
that
a
sweet
fragrance
came
*NL*
from
their
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
in
spite
of
these
edifying
memories
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
*NL*
the
frivolity
,
absurdity
and
malice
that
were
manifested
beside
the
coffin
*NL*
of
Father
Zossima
.
It
is
my
private
opinion
that
several
different
causes
*NL*
were
simultaneously
at
work
,
one
of
which
was
the
deeply-rooted
hostility
*NL*
to
the
institution
of
elders
as
a
pernicious
innovation
,
an
antipathy
*NL*
hidden
deep
in
the
hearts
of
many
of
the
monks
.
Even
more
powerful
was
*NL*
jealousy
of
the
dead
man
's
saintliness
,
so
firmly
established
during
his
*NL*
lifetime
that
it
was
almost
a
forbidden
thing
to
question
it
.
For
though
*NL*
the
late
elder
had
won
over
many
hearts
,
more
by
love
than
by
miracles
,
*NL*
and
had
gathered
round
him
a
mass
of
loving
adherents
,
none
the
less
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
rather
the
more
on
that
account
he
had
awakened
jealousy
and
so
had
*NL*
come
to
have
bitter
enemies
,
secret
and
open
,
not
only
in
the
monastery
*NL*
but
in
the
world
outside
it
.
He
did
no
one
any
harm
,
but
``
Why
do
they
*NL*
think
him
so
saintly
?
''
And
that
question
alone
,
gradually
repeated
,
gave
*NL*
rise
at
last
to
an
intense
,
insatiable
hatred
of
him
.
That
,
I
believe
,
was
*NL*
why
many
people
were
extremely
delighted
at
the
smell
of
decomposition
*NL*
which
came
so
quickly
,
for
not
a
day
had
passed
since
his
death
.
At
the
*NL*
same
time
there
were
some
among
those
who
had
been
hitherto
reverently
*NL*
devoted
to
the
elder
,
who
were
almost
mortified
and
personally
affronted
*NL*
by
this
incident
.
This
was
how
the
thing
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
signs
of
decomposition
had
begun
to
appear
,
the
whole
aspect
of
*NL*
the
monks
betrayed
their
secret
motives
in
entering
the
cell
.
They
went
*NL*
in
,
stayed
a
little
while
and
hastened
out
to
confirm
the
news
to
the
*NL*
crowd
of
other
monks
waiting
outside
.
Some
of
the
latter
shook
their
heads
*NL*
mournfully
,
but
others
did
not
even
care
to
conceal
the
delight
which
*NL*
gleamed
unmistakably
in
their
malignant
eyes
.
And
now
no
one
reproached
*NL*
them
for
it
,
no
one
raised
his
voice
in
protest
,
which
was
strange
,
for
*NL*
the
majority
of
the
monks
had
been
devoted
to
the
dead
elder
.
But
it
*NL*
seemed
as
though
God
had
in
this
case
let
the
minority
get
the
upper
hand
*NL*
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Visitors
from
outside
,
particularly
of
the
educated
class
,
soon
went
into
*NL*
the
cell
,
too
,
with
the
same
spying
intent
.
Of
the
peasantry
few
went
into
*NL*
the
cell
,
though
there
were
crowds
of
them
at
the
gates
of
the
hermitage
.
*NL*
After
three
o'clock
the
rush
of
worldly
visitors
was
greatly
increased
and
*NL*
this
was
no
doubt
owing
to
the
shocking
news
.
People
were
attracted
who
*NL*
would
not
otherwise
have
come
on
that
day
and
had
not
intended
to
come
,
*NL*
and
among
them
were
some
personages
of
high
standing
.
But
external
decorum
*NL*
was
still
preserved
and
Father
Paissy
,
with
a
stern
face
,
continued
firmly
*NL*
and
distinctly
reading
aloud
the
Gospel
,
apparently
not
noticing
what
was
*NL*
taking
place
around
him
,
though
he
had
,
in
fact
,
observed
something
*NL*
unusual
long
before
.
But
at
last
the
murmurs
,
first
subdued
but
gradually
*NL*
louder
and
more
confident
,
reached
even
him
.
``
It
shows
God
's
judgment
is
*NL*
not
as
man
's
,
''
Father
Paissy
heard
suddenly
.
The
first
to
give
utterance
*NL*
to
this
sentiment
was
a
layman
,
an
elderly
official
from
the
town
,
known
*NL*
to
be
a
man
of
great
piety
.
But
he
only
repeated
aloud
what
the
monks
had
*NL*
long
been
whispering
.
They
had
long
before
formulated
this
damning
*NL*
conclusion
,
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
a
sort
of
triumphant
satisfaction
*NL*
at
that
conclusion
became
more
and
more
apparent
every
moment
.
Soon
they
*NL*
began
to
lay
aside
even
external
decorum
and
almost
seemed
to
feel
they
*NL*
had
a
sort
of
right
to
discard
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
what
reason
can
_
this
_
have
happened
,
''
some
of
the
monks
said
,
at
*NL*
first
with
a
show
of
regret
;
``
he
had
a
small
frame
and
his
flesh
was
dried
*NL*
up
on
his
bones
,
what
was
there
to
decay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
a
sign
from
heaven
,
''
others
hastened
to
add
,
and
their
opinion
*NL*
was
adopted
at
once
without
protest
.
For
it
was
pointed
out
,
too
,
that
if
*NL*
the
decomposition
had
been
natural
,
as
in
the
case
of
every
dead
sinner
,
*NL*
it
would
have
been
apparent
later
,
after
a
lapse
of
at
least
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
,
but
this
premature
corruption
``
was
in
excess
of
nature
,
''
and
so
the
*NL*
finger
of
God
was
evident
.
It
was
meant
for
a
sign
.
This
conclusion
seemed
*NL*
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentle
Father
Iosif
,
the
librarian
,
a
great
favorite
of
the
dead
man
's
,
*NL*
tried
to
reply
to
some
of
the
evil
speakers
that
``
this
is
not
held
*NL*
everywhere
alike
,
''
and
that
the
incorruptibility
of
the
bodies
of
the
just
*NL*
was
not
a
dogma
of
the
Orthodox
Church
,
but
only
an
opinion
,
and
that
even
*NL*
in
the
most
Orthodox
regions
,
at
Athos
for
instance
,
they
were
not
greatly
*NL*
confounded
by
the
smell
of
corruption
,
and
there
the
chief
sign
of
the
*NL*
glorification
of
the
saved
was
not
bodily
incorruptibility
,
but
the
color
*NL*
of
the
bones
when
the
bodies
have
lain
many
years
in
the
earth
and
have
*NL*
decayed
in
it
.
``
And
if
the
bones
are
yellow
as
wax
,
that
is
the
great
sign
*NL*
that
the
Lord
has
glorified
the
dead
saint
,
if
they
are
not
yellow
but
*NL*
black
,
it
shows
that
God
has
not
deemed
him
worthy
of
such
glory
--
that
is
*NL*
the
belief
in
Athos
,
a
great
place
,
where
the
Orthodox
doctrine
has
been
*NL*
preserved
from
of
old
,
unbroken
and
in
its
greatest
purity
,
''
said
Father
*NL*
Iosif
in
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
meek
Father
's
words
had
little
effect
and
even
provoked
a
mocking
*NL*
retort
.
``
That
's
all
pedantry
and
innovation
,
no
use
listening
to
it
,
''
the
*NL*
monks
decided
.
``
We
stick
to
the
old
doctrine
,
there
are
all
sorts
of
*NL*
innovations
nowadays
,
are
we
to
follow
them
all
?
''
added
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
had
as
many
holy
fathers
as
they
had
.
There
they
are
among
the
*NL*
Turks
,
they
have
forgotten
everything
.
Their
doctrine
has
long
been
impure
*NL*
and
they
have
no
bells
even
,
''
the
most
sneering
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Iosif
walked
away
,
grieving
the
more
since
he
had
put
forward
his
*NL*
own
opinion
with
little
confidence
as
though
scarcely
believing
in
it
*NL*
himself
.
He
foresaw
with
distress
that
something
very
unseemly
was
*NL*
beginning
and
that
there
were
positive
signs
of
disobedience
.
Little
by
*NL*
little
,
all
the
sensible
monks
were
reduced
to
silence
like
Father
Iosif
.
*NL*
And
so
it
came
to
pass
that
all
who
loved
the
elder
and
had
accepted
with
*NL*
devout
obedience
the
institution
of
the
eldership
were
all
at
once
*NL*
terribly
cast
down
and
glanced
timidly
in
one
another
's
faces
,
when
they
*NL*
met
.
Those
who
were
hostile
to
the
institution
of
elders
,
as
a
novelty
,
*NL*
held
up
their
heads
proudly
.
``
There
was
no
smell
of
corruption
from
the
*NL*
late
elder
Varsonofy
,
but
a
sweet
fragrance
,
''
they
recalled
malignantly
.
*NL*
``
But
he
gained
that
glory
not
because
he
was
an
elder
,
but
because
he
was
*NL*
a
holy
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
followed
by
a
shower
of
criticism
and
even
blame
of
Father
*NL*
Zossima
.
``
His
teaching
was
false
;
he
taught
that
life
is
a
great
joy
and
*NL*
not
a
vale
of
tears
,
''
said
some
of
the
more
unreasonable
.
``
He
followed
the
*NL*
fashionable
belief
,
he
did
not
recognize
material
fire
in
hell
,
''
others
,
*NL*
still
more
unreasonable
,
added
.
``
He
was
not
strict
in
fasting
,
allowed
*NL*
himself
sweet
things
,
ate
cherry
jam
with
his
tea
,
ladies
used
to
send
it
*NL*
to
him
.
Is
it
for
a
monk
of
strict
rule
to
drink
tea
?
''
could
be
heard
*NL*
among
some
of
the
envious
.
``
He
sat
in
pride
,
''
the
most
malignant
declared
*NL*
vindictively
;
``
he
considered
himself
a
saint
and
he
took
it
as
his
due
*NL*
when
people
knelt
before
him
.
''
``
He
abused
the
sacrament
of
confession
,
''
*NL*
the
fiercest
opponents
of
the
institution
of
elders
added
in
a
malicious
*NL*
whisper
.
And
among
these
were
some
of
the
oldest
monks
,
strictest
in
their
*NL*
devotion
,
genuine
ascetics
,
who
had
kept
silent
during
the
life
of
the
*NL*
deceased
elder
,
but
now
suddenly
unsealed
their
lips
.
And
this
was
*NL*
terrible
,
for
their
words
had
great
influence
on
young
monks
who
were
not
*NL*
yet
firm
in
their
convictions
.
The
monk
from
Obdorsk
heard
all
this
*NL*
attentively
,
heaving
deep
sighs
and
nodding
his
head
.
``
Yes
,
clearly
Father
*NL*
Ferapont
was
right
in
his
judgment
yesterday
,
''
and
at
that
moment
Father
*NL*
Ferapont
himself
made
his
appearance
,
as
though
on
purpose
to
increase
the
*NL*
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
already
that
he
rarely
left
his
wooden
cell
by
the
*NL*
apiary
.
He
was
seldom
even
seen
at
church
and
they
overlooked
this
neglect
*NL*
on
the
ground
of
his
craziness
,
and
did
not
keep
him
to
the
rules
binding
*NL*
on
all
the
rest
.
But
if
the
whole
truth
is
to
be
told
,
they
hardly
had
a
*NL*
choice
about
it
.
For
it
would
have
been
discreditable
to
insist
on
*NL*
burdening
with
the
common
regulations
so
great
an
ascetic
,
who
prayed
day
*NL*
and
night
-LRB-
he
even
dropped
asleep
on
his
knees
-RRB-
.
If
they
had
insisted
,
the
*NL*
monks
would
have
said
,
``
He
is
holier
than
all
of
us
and
he
follows
a
rule
*NL*
harder
than
ours
.
And
if
he
does
not
go
to
church
,
it
's
because
he
knows
*NL*
when
he
ought
to
;
he
has
his
own
rule
.
''
It
was
to
avoid
the
chance
of
*NL*
these
sinful
murmurs
that
Father
Ferapont
was
left
in
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
every
one
was
aware
,
Father
Ferapont
particularly
disliked
Father
*NL*
Zossima
.
And
now
the
news
had
reached
him
in
his
hut
that
``
God
's
judgment
*NL*
is
not
the
same
as
man
's
,
''
and
that
something
had
happened
which
was
``
in
*NL*
excess
of
nature
.
''
It
may
well
be
supposed
that
among
the
first
to
run
to
*NL*
him
with
the
news
was
the
monk
from
Obdorsk
,
who
had
visited
him
the
*NL*
evening
before
and
left
his
cell
terror-stricken
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
above
,
that
though
Father
Paissy
,
standing
firm
and
*NL*
immovable
reading
the
Gospel
over
the
coffin
,
could
not
hear
nor
see
what
*NL*
was
passing
outside
the
cell
,
he
gauged
most
of
it
correctly
in
his
heart
,
*NL*
for
he
knew
the
men
surrounding
him
,
well
.
He
was
not
shaken
by
it
,
but
*NL*
awaited
what
would
come
next
without
fear
,
watching
with
penetration
and
*NL*
insight
for
the
outcome
of
the
general
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
an
extraordinary
uproar
in
the
passage
in
open
defiance
of
*NL*
decorum
burst
on
his
ears
.
The
door
was
flung
open
and
Father
Ferapont
*NL*
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
Behind
him
there
could
be
seen
accompanying
him
a
*NL*
crowd
of
monks
,
together
with
many
people
from
the
town
.
They
did
not
,
*NL*
however
,
enter
the
cell
,
but
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
,
waiting
to
*NL*
see
what
Father
Ferapont
would
say
or
do
.
For
they
felt
with
a
certain
*NL*
awe
,
in
spite
of
their
audacity
,
that
he
had
not
come
for
nothing
.
*NL*
Standing
in
the
doorway
,
Father
Ferapont
raised
his
arms
,
and
under
his
*NL*
right
arm
the
keen
inquisitive
little
eyes
of
the
monk
from
Obdorsk
peeped
*NL*
in
.
He
alone
,
in
his
intense
curiosity
,
could
not
resist
running
up
the
*NL*
steps
after
Father
Ferapont
.
The
others
,
on
the
contrary
,
pressed
farther
*NL*
back
in
sudden
alarm
when
the
door
was
noisily
flung
open
.
Holding
his
*NL*
hands
aloft
,
Father
Ferapont
suddenly
roared
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Casting
out
I
cast
out
!
''
and
,
turning
in
all
directions
,
he
began
at
once
*NL*
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
at
each
of
the
four
walls
and
four
corners
of
*NL*
the
cell
in
succession
.
All
who
accompanied
Father
Ferapont
immediately
*NL*
understood
his
action
.
For
they
knew
he
always
did
this
wherever
he
went
,
*NL*
and
that
he
would
not
sit
down
or
say
a
word
,
till
he
had
driven
out
the
*NL*
evil
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Satan
,
go
hence
!
Satan
,
go
hence
!
''
he
repeated
at
each
sign
of
the
cross
.
*NL*
``
Casting
out
I
cast
out
,
''
he
roared
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
wearing
his
coarse
gown
girt
with
a
rope
.
His
bare
chest
,
covered
*NL*
with
gray
hair
,
could
be
seen
under
his
hempen
shirt
.
His
feet
were
bare
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
began
waving
his
arms
,
the
cruel
irons
he
wore
under
his
*NL*
gown
could
be
heard
clanking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Paissy
paused
in
his
reading
,
stepped
forward
and
stood
before
him
*NL*
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
come
for
,
worthy
Father
?
Why
do
you
offend
against
good
*NL*
order
?
Why
do
you
disturb
the
peace
of
the
flock
?
''
he
said
at
last
,
*NL*
looking
sternly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
come
for
?
You
ask
why
?
What
is
your
faith
?
''
shouted
Father
*NL*
Ferapont
crazily
.
``
I
've
come
here
to
drive
out
your
visitors
,
the
unclean
*NL*
devils
.
I
've
come
to
see
how
many
have
gathered
here
while
I
have
been
*NL*
away
.
I
want
to
sweep
them
out
with
a
birch
broom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
cast
out
the
evil
spirit
,
but
perhaps
you
are
serving
him
yourself
,
''
*NL*
Father
Paissy
went
on
fearlessly
.
``
And
who
can
say
of
himself
'
I
am
holy
'
?
*NL*
Can
you
,
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
unclean
,
not
holy
.
I
would
not
sit
in
an
arm-chair
and
would
not
*NL*
have
them
bow
down
to
me
as
an
idol
,
''
thundered
Father
Ferapont
.
``
Nowadays
*NL*
folk
destroy
the
true
faith
.
The
dead
man
,
your
saint
,
''
he
turned
to
the
*NL*
crowd
,
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
coffin
,
``
did
not
believe
in
devils
.
*NL*
He
gave
medicine
to
keep
off
the
devils
.
And
so
they
have
become
as
common
*NL*
as
spiders
in
the
corners
.
And
now
he
has
begun
to
stink
himself
.
In
that
*NL*
we
see
a
great
sign
from
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
incident
he
referred
to
was
this
.
One
of
the
monks
was
haunted
in
his
*NL*
dreams
and
,
later
on
,
in
waking
moments
,
by
visions
of
evil
spirits
.
When
*NL*
in
the
utmost
terror
he
confided
this
to
Father
Zossima
,
the
elder
had
*NL*
advised
continual
prayer
and
rigid
fasting
.
But
when
that
was
of
no
use
,
*NL*
he
advised
him
,
while
persisting
in
prayer
and
fasting
,
to
take
a
special
*NL*
medicine
.
Many
persons
were
shocked
at
the
time
and
wagged
their
heads
as
*NL*
they
talked
over
it
--
and
most
of
all
Father
Ferapont
,
to
whom
some
of
the
*NL*
censorious
had
hastened
to
report
this
``
extraordinary
''
counsel
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
elder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
Father
!
''
said
Father
Paissy
,
in
a
commanding
voice
,
``
it
's
not
*NL*
for
man
to
judge
but
for
God
.
Perhaps
we
see
here
a
`
sign
'
which
neither
*NL*
you
,
nor
I
,
nor
any
one
of
us
is
able
to
comprehend
.
Go
,
Father
,
and
do
*NL*
not
trouble
the
flock
!
''
he
repeated
impressively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
keep
the
fasts
according
to
the
rule
and
therefore
the
sign
*NL*
has
come
.
That
is
clear
and
it
's
a
sin
to
hide
it
,
''
the
fanatic
,
carried
*NL*
away
by
a
zeal
that
outstripped
his
reason
,
would
not
be
quieted
.
``
He
was
*NL*
seduced
by
sweetmeats
,
ladies
brought
them
to
him
in
their
pockets
,
he
*NL*
sipped
tea
,
he
worshiped
his
belly
,
filling
it
with
sweet
things
and
his
*NL*
mind
with
haughty
thoughts
...
And
for
this
he
is
put
to
shame
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
lightly
,
Father
.
''
Father
Paissy
,
too
,
raised
his
voice
.
``
I
*NL*
admire
your
fasting
and
severities
,
but
you
speak
lightly
like
some
*NL*
frivolous
youth
,
fickle
and
childish
.
Go
away
,
Father
,
I
command
you
!
''
*NL*
Father
Paissy
thundered
in
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
,
''
said
Ferapont
,
seeming
somewhat
taken
aback
,
but
still
as
*NL*
bitter
.
``
You
learned
men
!
You
are
so
clever
you
look
down
upon
my
*NL*
humbleness
.
I
came
hither
with
little
learning
and
here
I
have
forgotten
*NL*
what
I
did
know
,
God
Himself
has
preserved
me
in
my
weakness
from
your
*NL*
subtlety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Paissy
stood
over
him
,
waiting
resolutely
.
Father
Ferapont
paused
*NL*
and
,
suddenly
leaning
his
cheek
on
his
hand
despondently
,
pronounced
in
a
*NL*
sing-song
voice
,
looking
at
the
coffin
of
the
dead
elder
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
they
will
sing
over
him
`
Our
Helper
and
Defender
'
--
a
splendid
*NL*
anthem
--
and
over
me
when
I
die
all
they
'll
sing
will
be
`
What
earthly
*NL*
joy
'
--
a
little
canticle
,
''
-LRB-
6
-RRB-
he
added
with
tearful
regret
.
``
You
are
proud
*NL*
and
puffed
up
,
this
is
a
vain
place
!
''
he
shouted
suddenly
like
a
madman
,
*NL*
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
turned
quickly
and
quickly
descended
the
*NL*
steps
.
The
crowd
awaiting
him
below
wavered
;
some
followed
him
at
once
and
*NL*
some
lingered
,
for
the
cell
was
still
open
,
and
Father
Paissy
,
following
*NL*
Father
Ferapont
on
to
the
steps
,
stood
watching
him
.
But
the
excited
old
*NL*
fanatic
was
not
completely
silenced
.
Walking
twenty
steps
away
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
turned
towards
the
setting
sun
,
raised
both
his
arms
and
,
as
*NL*
though
some
one
had
cut
him
down
,
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
loud
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
has
conquered
!
Christ
has
conquered
the
setting
sun
!
''
he
shouted
*NL*
frantically
,
stretching
up
his
hands
to
the
sun
,
and
falling
face
*NL*
downwards
on
the
ground
,
he
sobbed
like
a
little
child
,
shaken
by
his
*NL*
tears
and
spreading
out
his
arms
on
the
ground
.
Then
all
rushed
up
to
him
;
*NL*
there
were
exclamations
and
sympathetic
sobs
...
a
kind
of
frenzy
seemed
*NL*
to
take
possession
of
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
one
who
is
a
saint
!
This
is
the
one
who
is
a
holy
man
!
''
some
*NL*
cried
aloud
,
losing
their
fear
.
``
This
is
he
who
should
be
an
elder
,
''
*NL*
others
added
malignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
be
an
elder
...
he
would
refuse
...
he
would
n't
serve
a
*NL*
cursed
innovation
...
he
would
n't
imitate
their
foolery
,
''
other
voices
*NL*
chimed
in
at
once
.
And
it
is
hard
to
say
how
far
they
might
have
gone
,
but
*NL*
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
summoning
them
to
service
.
All
began
crossing
*NL*
themselves
at
once
.
Father
Ferapont
,
too
,
got
up
and
crossing
himself
went
*NL*
back
to
his
cell
without
looking
round
,
still
uttering
exclamations
which
*NL*
were
utterly
incoherent
.
A
few
followed
him
,
but
the
greater
number
*NL*
dispersed
,
hastening
to
service
.
Father
Paissy
let
Father
Iosif
read
in
*NL*
his
place
and
went
down
.
The
frantic
outcries
of
bigots
could
not
shake
*NL*
him
,
but
his
heart
was
suddenly
filled
with
melancholy
for
some
special
*NL*
reason
and
he
felt
that
.
He
stood
still
and
suddenly
wondered
,
``
Why
am
I
*NL*
sad
even
to
dejection
?
''
and
immediately
grasped
with
surprise
that
his
*NL*
sudden
sadness
was
due
to
a
very
small
and
special
cause
.
In
the
crowd
*NL*
thronging
at
the
entrance
to
the
cell
,
he
had
noticed
Alyosha
and
he
*NL*
remembered
that
he
had
felt
at
once
a
pang
at
heart
on
seeing
him
.
``
Can
*NL*
that
boy
mean
so
much
to
my
heart
now
?
''
he
asked
himself
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Alyosha
passed
him
,
hurrying
away
,
but
not
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
church
.
Their
eyes
met
.
Alyosha
quickly
turned
away
his
eyes
and
*NL*
dropped
them
to
the
ground
,
and
from
the
boy
's
look
alone
,
Father
Paissy
*NL*
guessed
what
a
great
change
was
taking
place
in
him
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
too
,
fallen
into
temptation
?
''
cried
Father
Paissy
.
``
Can
you
be
*NL*
with
those
of
little
faith
?
''
he
added
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
stood
still
and
gazed
vaguely
at
Father
Paissy
,
but
quickly
turned
*NL*
his
eyes
away
again
and
again
looked
on
the
ground
.
He
stood
sideways
and
*NL*
did
not
turn
his
face
to
Father
Paissy
,
who
watched
him
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
hastening
?
The
bell
calls
to
service
,
''
he
asked
again
,
but
*NL*
again
Alyosha
gave
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
leaving
the
hermitage
?
What
,
without
asking
leave
,
without
asking
*NL*
a
blessing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
suddenly
gave
a
wry
smile
,
cast
a
strange
,
very
strange
,
look
at
*NL*
the
Father
to
whom
his
former
guide
,
the
former
sovereign
of
his
heart
and
*NL*
mind
,
his
beloved
elder
,
had
confided
him
as
he
lay
dying
.
And
suddenly
,
*NL*
still
without
speaking
,
waved
his
hand
,
as
though
not
caring
even
to
be
*NL*
respectful
,
and
with
rapid
steps
walked
towards
the
gates
away
from
the
*NL*
hermitage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
come
back
again
!
''
murmured
Father
Paissy
,
looking
after
him
with
*NL*
sorrowful
surprise
.

Chapter
II
.
A
Critical
Moment
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Paissy
,
of
course
,
was
not
wrong
when
he
decided
that
his
``
dear
*NL*
boy
''
would
come
back
again
.
Perhaps
indeed
,
to
some
extent
,
he
penetrated
*NL*
with
insight
into
the
true
meaning
of
Alyosha
's
spiritual
condition
.
Yet
I
*NL*
must
frankly
own
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
give
a
clear
*NL*
account
of
that
strange
,
vague
moment
in
the
life
of
the
young
hero
I
love
*NL*
so
much
.
To
Father
Paissy
's
sorrowful
question
,
``
Are
you
too
with
those
of
*NL*
little
faith
?
''
I
could
of
course
confidently
answer
for
Alyosha
,
``
No
,
he
*NL*
is
not
with
those
of
little
faith
.
Quite
the
contrary
.
''
Indeed
,
all
his
*NL*
trouble
came
from
the
fact
that
he
was
of
great
faith
.
But
still
the
*NL*
trouble
was
there
and
was
so
agonizing
that
even
long
afterwards
Alyosha
*NL*
thought
of
that
sorrowful
day
as
one
of
the
bitterest
and
most
fatal
days
*NL*
of
his
life
.
If
the
question
is
asked
:
``
Could
all
his
grief
and
*NL*
disturbance
have
been
only
due
to
the
fact
that
his
elder
's
body
had
shown
*NL*
signs
of
premature
decomposition
instead
of
at
once
performing
miracles
?
''
*NL*
I
must
answer
without
beating
about
the
bush
,
``
Yes
,
it
certainly
was
.
''
I
*NL*
would
only
beg
the
reader
not
to
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
laugh
at
my
*NL*
young
hero
's
pure
heart
.
I
am
far
from
intending
to
apologize
for
him
or
*NL*
to
justify
his
innocent
faith
on
the
ground
of
his
youth
,
or
the
little
*NL*
progress
he
had
made
in
his
studies
,
or
any
such
reason
.
I
must
declare
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
that
I
have
genuine
respect
for
the
qualities
of
his
*NL*
heart
.
No
doubt
a
youth
who
received
impressions
cautiously
,
whose
love
*NL*
was
lukewarm
,
and
whose
mind
was
too
prudent
for
his
age
and
so
of
little
*NL*
value
,
such
a
young
man
might
,
I
admit
,
have
avoided
what
happened
to
my
*NL*
hero
.
But
in
some
cases
it
is
really
more
creditable
to
be
carried
away
by
*NL*
an
emotion
,
however
unreasonable
,
which
springs
from
a
great
love
,
than
to
*NL*
be
unmoved
.
And
this
is
even
truer
in
youth
,
for
a
young
man
who
is
always
*NL*
sensible
is
to
be
suspected
and
is
of
little
worth
--
that
's
my
opinion
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
reasonable
people
will
exclaim
perhaps
,
``
every
young
man
can
not
*NL*
believe
in
such
a
superstition
and
your
hero
is
no
model
for
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
I
reply
again
,
``
Yes
!
my
hero
had
faith
,
a
faith
holy
and
*NL*
steadfast
,
but
still
I
am
not
going
to
apologize
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
declared
above
,
and
perhaps
too
hastily
,
that
I
should
not
*NL*
explain
or
justify
my
hero
,
I
see
that
some
explanation
is
necessary
for
*NL*
the
understanding
of
the
rest
of
my
story
.
Let
me
say
then
,
it
was
not
a
*NL*
question
of
miracles
.
There
was
no
frivolous
and
impatient
expectation
of
*NL*
miracles
in
his
mind
.
And
Alyosha
needed
no
miracles
at
the
time
,
for
the
*NL*
triumph
of
some
preconceived
idea
--
oh
,
no
,
not
at
all
--
what
he
saw
before
*NL*
all
was
one
figure
--
the
figure
of
his
beloved
elder
,
the
figure
of
that
*NL*
holy
man
whom
he
revered
with
such
adoration
.
The
fact
is
that
all
the
*NL*
love
that
lay
concealed
in
his
pure
young
heart
for
every
one
and
*NL*
everything
had
,
for
the
past
year
,
been
concentrated
--
and
perhaps
wrongly
*NL*
so
--
on
one
being
,
his
beloved
elder
.
It
is
true
that
being
had
for
so
long
*NL*
been
accepted
by
him
as
his
ideal
,
that
all
his
young
strength
and
energy
*NL*
could
not
but
turn
towards
that
ideal
,
even
to
the
forgetting
at
the
*NL*
moment
``
of
every
one
and
everything
.
''
He
remembered
afterwards
how
,
on
*NL*
that
terrible
day
,
he
had
entirely
forgotten
his
brother
Dmitri
,
about
*NL*
whom
he
had
been
so
anxious
and
troubled
the
day
before
;
he
had
forgotten
,
*NL*
too
,
to
take
the
two
hundred
roubles
to
Ilusha
's
father
,
though
he
had
so
*NL*
warmly
intended
to
do
so
the
preceding
evening
.
But
again
it
was
not
*NL*
miracles
he
needed
but
only
``
the
higher
justice
''
which
had
been
in
his
*NL*
belief
outraged
by
the
blow
that
had
so
suddenly
and
cruelly
wounded
his
*NL*
heart
.
And
what
does
it
signify
that
this
``
justice
''
looked
for
by
Alyosha
*NL*
inevitably
took
the
shape
of
miracles
to
be
wrought
immediately
by
the
*NL*
ashes
of
his
adored
teacher
?
Why
,
every
one
in
the
monastery
cherished
the
*NL*
same
thought
and
the
same
hope
,
even
those
whose
intellects
Alyosha
*NL*
revered
,
Father
Paissy
himself
,
for
instance
.
And
so
Alyosha
,
untroubled
*NL*
by
doubts
,
clothed
his
dreams
too
in
the
same
form
as
all
the
rest
.
And
a
*NL*
whole
year
of
life
in
the
monastery
had
formed
the
habit
of
this
*NL*
expectation
in
his
heart
.
But
it
was
justice
,
justice
,
he
thirsted
for
,
*NL*
not
simply
miracles
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
man
who
should
,
he
believed
,
have
been
exalted
above
every
one
*NL*
in
the
whole
world
,
that
man
,
instead
of
receiving
the
glory
that
was
his
*NL*
due
,
was
suddenly
degraded
and
dishonored
!
What
for
?
Who
had
judged
him
?
*NL*
Who
could
have
decreed
this
?
Those
were
the
questions
that
wrung
his
*NL*
inexperienced
and
virginal
heart
.
He
could
not
endure
without
*NL*
mortification
,
without
resentment
even
,
that
the
holiest
of
holy
men
*NL*
should
have
been
exposed
to
the
jeering
and
spiteful
mockery
of
the
*NL*
frivolous
crowd
so
inferior
to
him
.
Even
had
there
been
no
miracles
,
had
*NL*
there
been
nothing
marvelous
to
justify
his
hopes
,
why
this
indignity
,
why
*NL*
this
humiliation
,
why
this
premature
decay
,
``
in
excess
of
nature
,
''
as
the
*NL*
spiteful
monks
said
?
Why
this
``
sign
from
heaven
,
''
which
they
so
*NL*
triumphantly
acclaimed
in
company
with
Father
Ferapont
,
and
why
did
they
*NL*
believe
they
had
gained
the
right
to
acclaim
it
?
Where
is
the
finger
of
*NL*
Providence
?
Why
did
Providence
hide
its
face
``
at
the
most
critical
moment
''
*NL*
-LRB-
so
Alyosha
thought
it
-RRB-
,
as
though
voluntarily
submitting
to
the
blind
,
*NL*
dumb
,
pitiless
laws
of
nature
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
why
Alyosha
's
heart
was
bleeding
,
and
,
of
course
,
as
I
have
said
*NL*
already
,
the
sting
of
it
all
was
that
the
man
he
loved
above
everything
on
*NL*
earth
should
be
put
to
shame
and
humiliated
!
This
murmuring
may
have
been
*NL*
shallow
and
unreasonable
in
my
hero
,
but
I
repeat
again
for
the
third
*NL*
time
--
and
am
prepared
to
admit
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
defend
my
*NL*
feeling
--
I
am
glad
that
my
hero
showed
himself
not
too
reasonable
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
for
any
man
of
sense
will
always
come
back
to
reason
in
time
,
but
,
*NL*
if
love
does
not
gain
the
upper
hand
in
a
boy
's
heart
at
such
an
*NL*
exceptional
moment
,
when
will
it
?
I
will
not
,
however
,
omit
to
mention
*NL*
something
strange
,
which
came
for
a
time
to
the
surface
of
Alyosha
's
mind
*NL*
at
this
fatal
and
obscure
moment
.
This
new
something
was
the
harassing
*NL*
impression
left
by
the
conversation
with
Ivan
,
which
now
persistently
*NL*
haunted
Alyosha
's
mind
.
At
this
moment
it
haunted
him
.
Oh
,
it
was
not
that
*NL*
something
of
the
fundamental
,
elemental
,
so
to
speak
,
faith
of
his
soul
*NL*
had
been
shaken
.
He
loved
his
God
and
believed
in
Him
steadfastly
,
though
*NL*
he
was
suddenly
murmuring
against
Him
.
Yet
a
vague
but
tormenting
and
evil
*NL*
impression
left
by
his
conversation
with
Ivan
the
day
before
,
suddenly
*NL*
revived
again
now
in
his
soul
and
seemed
forcing
its
way
to
the
surface
of
*NL*
his
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
begun
to
get
dusk
when
Rakitin
,
crossing
the
pine
copse
from
the
*NL*
hermitage
to
the
monastery
,
suddenly
noticed
Alyosha
,
lying
face
downwards
*NL*
on
the
ground
under
a
tree
,
not
moving
and
apparently
asleep
.
He
went
up
*NL*
and
called
him
by
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
here
,
Alexey
?
Can
you
have
--
''
he
began
wondering
but
broke
off
.
He
had
*NL*
meant
to
say
,
``
Can
you
have
come
to
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
did
not
look
at
him
,
but
from
a
slight
movement
Rakitin
at
once
*NL*
saw
that
he
heard
and
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
he
went
on
;
but
the
surprise
in
his
face
gradually
*NL*
passed
into
a
smile
that
became
more
and
more
ironical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
I
've
been
looking
for
you
for
the
last
two
hours
.
You
suddenly
*NL*
disappeared
.
What
are
you
about
?
What
foolery
is
this
?
You
might
just
look
*NL*
at
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
raised
his
head
,
sat
up
and
leaned
his
back
against
the
tree
.
He
*NL*
was
not
crying
,
but
there
was
a
look
of
suffering
and
irritability
in
his
*NL*
face
.
He
did
not
look
at
Rakitin
,
however
,
but
looked
away
to
one
side
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
your
face
is
quite
changed
?
There
's
none
of
your
famous
*NL*
mildness
to
be
seen
in
it
.
Are
you
angry
with
some
one
?
Have
they
been
*NL*
ill-treating
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
,
''
said
Alyosha
suddenly
,
with
a
weary
gesture
of
his
hand
,
*NL*
still
looking
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
So
that
's
how
we
are
feeling
!
So
you
can
shout
at
people
like
other
*NL*
mortals
.
That
is
a
come-down
from
the
angels
.
I
say
,
Alyosha
,
you
have
*NL*
surprised
me
,
do
you
hear
?
I
mean
it
.
It
's
long
since
I
've
been
surprised
*NL*
at
anything
here
.
I
always
took
you
for
an
educated
man
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
at
last
looked
at
him
,
but
vaguely
,
as
though
scarcely
*NL*
understanding
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
really
be
so
upset
simply
because
your
old
man
has
begun
to
*NL*
stink
?
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
seriously
believed
that
he
was
going
to
*NL*
work
miracles
?
''
exclaimed
Rakitin
,
genuinely
surprised
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believed
,
I
believe
,
I
want
to
believe
,
and
I
will
believe
,
what
more
*NL*
do
you
want
?
''
cried
Alyosha
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
,
my
boy
.
Damn
it
all
!
why
,
no
schoolboy
of
thirteen
*NL*
believes
in
that
now
.
But
there
...
So
now
you
are
in
a
temper
with
your
*NL*
God
,
you
are
rebelling
against
Him
;
He
has
n't
given
promotion
,
He
has
n't
*NL*
bestowed
the
order
of
merit
!
Eh
,
you
are
a
set
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
gazed
a
long
while
with
his
eyes
half
closed
at
Rakitin
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
sudden
gleam
in
his
eyes
...
but
not
of
anger
with
Rakitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
rebelling
against
my
God
;
I
simply
`
do
n't
accept
His
world
.
'
''
*NL*
Alyosha
suddenly
smiled
a
forced
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
you
do
n't
accept
the
world
?
''
Rakitin
thought
a
moment
*NL*
over
his
answer
.
``
What
idiocy
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
enough
nonsense
,
now
to
business
.
Have
you
had
anything
to
eat
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember

think
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
keeping
up
,
to
judge
by
your
face

It
makes
one
sorry
to
look
at

you

You
did
n't
sleep
all
night
either
,
I
hear
,
you
had
a
meeting
in
*NL*
there

And
then
all
this
bobbery
afterwards
.
Most
likely
you
've
had
*NL*
nothing
to
eat
but
a
mouthful
of
holy
bread
.
I
've
got
some
sausage
in
my

pocket

I

brought

``

a
regular

with

Well
,
my
boy
,
we
must
make
the
most
of
it

Come
to
my
place

I
*NL*
should
n't
mind
a
drop
of
vodka
myself

I
am
tired
to
death

Vodka
is
going
*NL*
too
far
for
you

I
suppose

would
you
like
some
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
some
vodka

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
You
surprise
me

Rakitin
looked
at
him
in
amazement
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
one
way

another

vodka

is
a
jolly
fine
chance

be
missed

Come
along

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
got
up
in
silence
and
followed
Rakitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
little
brother
Ivan
could
see
this

would
n't
he
be
surprised

By
*NL*
the

your
brother
Ivan
set
off
to
Moscow
this
morning
,
did
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Alyosha
listlessly
,
and
suddenly
the
image
of
his
brother
*NL*
Dmitri
rose
before
his
mind
.
But
only
for
a
minute
,
and
though
it
reminded
*NL*
him
of
something
that
must
not
be
put
off
for
a
moment
,
some
duty
,
some
*NL*
terrible
obligation
,
even
that
reminder
made
no
impression
on
him
,
did
not
*NL*
reach
his
heart
and
instantly
faded
out
of
his
mind
and
was
forgotten
.
*NL*
But
,
a
long
while
afterwards
,
Alyosha
remembered
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
Ivan
declared
once
that
I
was
a
`
liberal
booby
with
no
*NL*
talents
whatsoever
.
'
Once
you
,
too
,
could
not
resist
letting
me
know
I
was
*NL*
`
dishonorable
.
'
Well
!
I
should
like
to
see
what
your
talents
and
sense
of
*NL*
honor
will
do
for
you
now
.
''
This
phrase
Rakitin
finished
to
himself
in
a
*NL*
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
he
said
aloud
,
``
let
's
go
by
the
path
beyond
the
monastery
*NL*
straight
to
the
town
.
Hm
!
I
ought
to
go
to
Madame
Hohlakov
's
by
the
way
.
*NL*
Only
fancy
,
I
've
written
to
tell
her
everything
that
happened
,
and
would
*NL*
you
believe
it
,
she
answered
me
instantly
in
pencil
-LRB-
the
lady
has
a
*NL*
passion
for
writing
notes
-RRB-
that
`
she
would
never
have
expected
_
such
*NL*
conduct
_
from
a
man
of
such
a
reverend
character
as
Father
Zossima
.
'
That
*NL*
was
her
very
word
:
`
conduct
.
'
She
is
angry
too
.
Eh
,
you
are
a
set
!
Stay
!
''
*NL*
he
cried
suddenly
again
.
He
suddenly
stopped
and
taking
Alyosha
by
the
*NL*
shoulder
made
him
stop
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Alyosha
,
''
he
peeped
inquisitively
into
his
eyes
,
absorbed
in
*NL*
a
sudden
new
thought
which
had
dawned
on
him
,
and
though
he
was
laughing
*NL*
outwardly
he
was
evidently
afraid
to
utter
that
new
idea
aloud
,
so
*NL*
difficult
he
still
found
it
to
believe
in
the
strange
and
unexpected
mood
*NL*
in
which
he
now
saw
Alyosha
.
``
Alyosha
,
do
you
know
where
we
had
better
*NL*
go
?
''
he
brought
out
at
last
timidly
,
and
insinuatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
...
where
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
to
Grushenka
,
eh
?
Will
you
come
?
''
pronounced
Rakitin
at
last
,
*NL*
trembling
with
timid
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
to
Grushenka
,
''
Alyosha
answered
calmly
,
at
once
,
and
this
prompt
*NL*
and
calm
agreement
was
such
a
surprise
to
Rakitin
that
he
almost
started
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
I
say
!
''
he
cried
in
amazement
,
but
seizing
Alyosha
firmly
by
the
*NL*
arm
he
led
him
along
the
path
,
still
dreading
that
he
would
change
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
in
silence
,
Rakitin
was
positively
afraid
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
glad
she
will
be
,
how
delighted
!
''
he
muttered
,
but
lapsed
into
*NL*
silence
again
.
And
indeed
it
was
not
to
please
Grushenka
he
was
taking
*NL*
Alyosha
to
her
.
He
was
a
practical
person
and
never
undertook
anything
*NL*
without
a
prospect
of
gain
for
himself
.
His
object
in
this
case
was
*NL*
twofold
,
first
a
revengeful
desire
to
see
``
the
downfall
of
the
righteous
,
''
*NL*
and
Alyosha
's
fall
``
from
the
saints
to
the
sinners
,
''
over
which
he
was
*NL*
already
gloating
in
his
imagination
,
and
in
the
second
place
he
had
in
*NL*
view
a
certain
material
gain
for
himself
,
of
which
more
will
be
said
*NL*
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
critical
moment
has
come
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
with
spiteful
*NL*
glee
,
``
and
we
shall
catch
it
on
the
hop
,
for
it
's
just
what
we
want
.

Chapter
III
.
An
Onion
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
lived
in
the
busiest
part
of
the
town
,
near
the
cathedral
*NL*
square
,
in
a
small
wooden
lodge
in
the
courtyard
belonging
to
the
house
of
*NL*
the
widow
Morozov
.
The
house
was
a
large
stone
building
of
two
stories
,
*NL*
old
and
very
ugly
.
The
widow
led
a
secluded
life
with
her
two
unmarried
*NL*
nieces
,
who
were
also
elderly
women
.
She
had
no
need
to
let
her
lodge
,
but
*NL*
every
one
knew
that
she
had
taken
in
Grushenka
as
a
lodger
,
four
years
*NL*
before
,
solely
to
please
her
kinsman
,
the
merchant
Samsonov
,
who
was
known
*NL*
to
be
the
girl
's
protector
.
It
was
said
that
the
jealous
old
man
's
object
*NL*
in
placing
his
``
favorite
''
with
the
widow
Morozov
was
that
the
old
woman
*NL*
should
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
her
new
lodger
's
conduct
.
But
this
sharp
eye
*NL*
soon
proved
to
be
unnecessary
,
and
in
the
end
the
widow
Morozov
seldom
met
*NL*
Grushenka
and
did
not
worry
her
by
looking
after
her
in
any
way
.
It
is
*NL*
true
that
four
years
had
passed
since
the
old
man
had
brought
the
slim
,
*NL*
delicate
,
shy
,
timid
,
dreamy
,
and
sad
girl
of
eighteen
from
the
chief
town
*NL*
of
the
province
,
and
much
had
happened
since
then
.
Little
was
known
of
the
*NL*
girl
's
history
in
the
town
and
that
little
was
vague
.
Nothing
more
had
*NL*
been
learnt
during
the
last
four
years
,
even
after
many
persons
had
become
*NL*
interested
in
the
beautiful
young
woman
into
whom
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
*NL*
had
meanwhile
developed
.
There
were
rumors
that
she
had
been
at
seventeen
*NL*
betrayed
by
some
one
,
some
sort
of
officer
,
and
immediately
afterwards
*NL*
abandoned
by
him
.
The
officer
had
gone
away
and
afterwards
married
,
while
*NL*
Grushenka
had
been
left
in
poverty
and
disgrace
.
It
was
said
,
however
,
*NL*
that
though
Grushenka
had
been
raised
from
destitution
by
the
old
man
,
*NL*
Samsonov
,
she
came
of
a
respectable
family
belonging
to
the
clerical
*NL*
class
,
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
deacon
or
something
of
the
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
after
four
years
the
sensitive
,
injured
and
pathetic
little
orphan
*NL*
had
become
a
plump
,
rosy
beauty
of
the
Russian
type
,
a
woman
of
bold
and
*NL*
determined
character
,
proud
and
insolent
.
She
had
a
good
head
for
*NL*
business
,
was
acquisitive
,
saving
and
careful
,
and
by
fair
means
or
foul
*NL*
had
succeeded
,
it
was
said
,
in
amassing
a
little
fortune
.
There
was
only
*NL*
one
point
on
which
all
were
agreed
.
Grushenka
was
not
easily
to
be
*NL*
approached
and
except
her
aged
protector
there
had
not
been
one
man
who
*NL*
could
boast
of
her
favors
during
those
four
years
.
It
was
a
positive
fact
,
*NL*
for
there
had
been
a
good
many
,
especially
during
the
last
two
years
,
who
*NL*
had
attempted
to
obtain
those
favors
.
But
all
their
efforts
had
been
in
*NL*
vain
and
some
of
these
suitors
had
been
forced
to
beat
an
undignified
and
*NL*
even
comic
retreat
,
owing
to
the
firm
and
ironical
resistance
they
met
*NL*
from
the
strong-willed
young
person
.
It
was
known
,
too
,
that
the
young
*NL*
person
had
,
especially
of
late
,
been
given
to
what
is
called
*NL*
``
speculation
,
''
and
that
she
had
shown
marked
abilities
in
that
direction
,
*NL*
so
that
many
people
began
to
say
that
she
was
no
better
than
a
Jew
.
It
was
*NL*
not
that
she
lent
money
on
interest
,
but
it
was
known
,
for
instance
,
that
*NL*
she
had
for
some
time
past
,
in
partnership
with
old
Karamazov
,
actually
*NL*
invested
in
the
purchase
of
bad
debts
for
a
trifle
,
a
tenth
of
their
*NL*
nominal
value
,
and
afterwards
had
made
out
of
them
ten
times
their
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
widower
Samsonov
,
a
man
of
large
fortune
,
was
stingy
and
*NL*
merciless
.
He
tyrannized
over
his
grown-up
sons
,
but
,
for
the
last
year
*NL*
during
which
he
had
been
ill
and
lost
the
use
of
his
swollen
legs
,
he
had
*NL*
fallen
greatly
under
the
influence
of
his
protegee
,
whom
he
had
at
first
*NL*
kept
strictly
and
in
humble
surroundings
,
``
on
Lenten
fare
,
''
as
the
wits
*NL*
said
at
the
time
.
But
Grushenka
had
succeeded
in
emancipating
herself
,
*NL*
while
she
established
in
him
a
boundless
belief
in
her
fidelity
.
The
old
*NL*
man
,
now
long
since
dead
,
had
had
a
large
business
in
his
day
and
was
also
*NL*
a
noteworthy
character
,
miserly
and
hard
as
flint
.
Though
Grushenka
's
hold
*NL*
upon
him
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
live
without
her
-LRB-
it
had
been
so
*NL*
especially
for
the
last
two
years
-RRB-
,
he
did
not
settle
any
considerable
*NL*
fortune
on
her
and
would
not
have
been
moved
to
do
so
,
if
she
had
*NL*
threatened
to
leave
him
.
But
he
had
presented
her
with
a
small
sum
,
and
*NL*
even
that
was
a
surprise
to
every
one
when
it
became
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
wench
with
brains
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
when
he
gave
her
eight
*NL*
thousand
roubles
,
``
and
you
must
look
after
yourself
,
but
let
me
tell
you
*NL*
that
except
your
yearly
allowance
as
before
,
you
'll
get
nothing
more
from
*NL*
me
to
the
day
of
my
death
,
and
I
'll
leave
you
nothing
in
my
will
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
kept
his
word
;
he
died
and
left
everything
to
his
sons
,
whom
,
with
*NL*
their
wives
and
children
,
he
had
treated
all
his
life
as
servants
.
*NL*
Grushenka
was
not
even
mentioned
in
his
will
.
All
this
became
known
*NL*
afterwards
.
He
helped
Grushenka
with
his
advice
to
increase
her
capital
*NL*
and
put
business
in
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
first
came
into
contact
with
Grushenka
over
a
*NL*
piece
of
speculation
,
ended
to
his
own
surprise
by
falling
madly
in
love
*NL*
with
her
,
old
Samsonov
,
gravely
ill
as
he
was
,
was
immensely
amused
.
It
is
*NL*
remarkable
that
throughout
their
whole
acquaintance
Grushenka
was
*NL*
absolutely
and
spontaneously
open
with
the
old
man
,
and
he
seems
to
have
*NL*
been
the
only
person
in
the
world
with
whom
she
was
so
.
Of
late
,
when
*NL*
Dmitri
too
had
come
on
the
scene
with
his
love
,
the
old
man
left
off
*NL*
laughing
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
once
gave
Grushenka
a
stern
and
earnest
*NL*
piece
of
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
to
choose
between
the
two
,
father
or
son
,
you
'd
better
choose
*NL*
the
old
man
,
if
only
you
make
sure
the
old
scoundrel
will
marry
you
and
*NL*
settle
some
fortune
on
you
beforehand
.
But
do
n't
keep
on
with
the
captain
,
*NL*
you
'll
get
no
good
out
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
very
words
of
the
old
profligate
,
who
felt
already
that
his
*NL*
death
was
not
far
off
and
who
actually
died
five
months
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
note
,
too
,
in
passing
,
that
although
many
in
our
town
knew
of
the
*NL*
grotesque
and
monstrous
rivalry
of
the
Karamazovs
,
father
and
son
,
the
*NL*
object
of
which
was
Grushenka
,
scarcely
any
one
understood
what
really
*NL*
underlay
her
attitude
to
both
of
them
.
Even
Grushenka
's
two
servants
*NL*
-LRB-
after
the
catastrophe
of
which
we
will
speak
later
-RRB-
testified
in
court
*NL*
that
she
received
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
simply
from
fear
because
``
he
*NL*
threatened
to
murder
her
.
''
These
servants
were
an
old
cook
,
invalidish
and
*NL*
almost
deaf
,
who
came
from
Grushenka
's
old
home
,
and
her
granddaughter
,
a
*NL*
smart
young
girl
of
twenty
,
who
performed
the
duties
of
a
maid
.
Grushenka
*NL*
lived
very
economically
and
her
surroundings
were
anything
but
luxurious
.
*NL*
Her
lodge
consisted
of
three
rooms
furnished
with
mahogany
furniture
in
*NL*
the
fashion
of
1820
,
belonging
to
her
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
dark
when
Rakitin
and
Alyosha
entered
her
rooms
,
yet
they
*NL*
were
not
lighted
up
.
Grushenka
was
lying
down
in
her
drawing-room
on
the
*NL*
big
,
hard
,
clumsy
sofa
,
with
a
mahogany
back
.
The
sofa
was
covered
with
*NL*
shabby
and
ragged
leather
.
Under
her
head
she
had
two
white
down
pillows
*NL*
taken
from
her
bed
.
She
was
lying
stretched
out
motionless
on
her
back
*NL*
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
.
She
was
dressed
as
though
expecting
some
*NL*
one
,
in
a
black
silk
dress
,
with
a
dainty
lace
fichu
on
her
head
,
which
*NL*
was
very
becoming
.
Over
her
shoulders
was
thrown
a
lace
shawl
pinned
with
*NL*
a
massive
gold
brooch
.
She
certainly
was
expecting
some
one
.
She
lay
as
*NL*
though
impatient
and
weary
,
her
face
rather
pale
and
her
lips
and
eyes
*NL*
hot
,
restlessly
tapping
the
arm
of
the
sofa
with
the
tip
of
her
right
*NL*
foot
.
The
appearance
of
Rakitin
and
Alyosha
caused
a
slight
excitement
.
*NL*
From
the
hall
they
could
hear
Grushenka
leap
up
from
the
sofa
and
cry
out
*NL*
in
a
frightened
voice
,
``
Who
's
there
?
''
But
the
maid
met
the
visitors
and
at
*NL*
once
called
back
to
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
he
,
it
's
nothing
,
only
other
visitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
be
the
matter
?
''
muttered
Rakitin
,
leading
Alyosha
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
was
standing
by
the
sofa
as
though
still
alarmed
.
A
thick
coil
*NL*
of
her
dark
brown
hair
escaped
from
its
lace
covering
and
fell
on
her
*NL*
right
shoulder
,
but
she
did
not
notice
it
and
did
not
put
it
back
till
she
*NL*
had
gazed
at
her
visitors
and
recognized
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
you
,
Rakitin
?
You
quite
frightened
me
.
Whom
have
you
brought
?
*NL*
Who
is
this
with
you
?
Good
heavens
,
you
have
brought
him
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
recognizing
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
send
for
candles
!
''
said
Rakitin
,
with
the
free-and-easy
air
of
a
most
*NL*
intimate
friend
,
who
is
privileged
to
give
orders
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Candles
...
of
course
,
candles
...
Fenya
,
fetch
him
a
candle
...
Well
,
*NL*
you
have
chosen
a
moment
to
bring
him
!
''
she
exclaimed
again
,
nodding
*NL*
towards
Alyosha
,
and
turning
to
the
looking-glass
she
began
quickly
*NL*
fastening
up
her
hair
with
both
hands
.
She
seemed
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
I
managed
to
please
you
?
''
asked
Rakitin
,
instantly
almost
*NL*
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
frightened
me
,
Rakitin
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
''
Grushenka
turned
with
a
*NL*
smile
to
Alyosha
.
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
,
my
dear
Alyosha
,
you
can
not
*NL*
think
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
,
my
unexpected
visitor
.
But
you
frightened
*NL*
me
,
Rakitin
,
I
thought
it
was
Mitya
breaking
in
.
You
see
,
I
deceived
him
*NL*
just
now
,
I
made
him
promise
to
believe
me
and
I
told
him
a
lie
.
I
told
*NL*
him
that
I
was
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
my
old
man
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
*NL*
and
should
be
there
till
late
counting
up
his
money
.
I
always
spend
one
*NL*
whole
evening
a
week
with
him
making
up
his
accounts
.
We
lock
ourselves
in
*NL*
and
he
counts
on
the
reckoning
beads
while
I
sit
and
put
things
down
in
*NL*
the
book
.
I
am
the
only
person
he
trusts
.
Mitya
believes
that
I
am
there
,
*NL*
but
I
came
back
and
have
been
sitting
locked
in
here
,
expecting
some
news
.
*NL*
How
was
it
Fenya
let
you
in
?
Fenya
,
Fenya
,
run
out
to
the
gate
,
open
it
*NL*
and
look
about
whether
the
captain
is
to
be
seen
!
Perhaps
he
is
hiding
and
*NL*
spying
,
I
am
dreadfully
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
there
,
Agrafena
Alexandrovna

I
've
just
looked
out

I
keep
*NL*
running
to
peep
through
the
crack

I
am
in
fear
and
trembling
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
shutters
fastened
,
Fenya
?
And
we
must
draw
the
curtains
--
that
's
*NL*
better
!

She
drew
the
heavy
curtains
herself
.
``
He
'd
rush
in
at
once
if
he
*NL*
saw
a
light
.
I
am
afraid
of
your
brother
Mitya
to-day
,
Alyosha
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
spoke
aloud
,
and
,
though
she
was
alarmed
,
she
seemed
very
happy
*NL*
about
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
so
afraid
of
Mitya
to-day
?
''
inquired
Rakitin
.
``
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
you
were
not
timid
with
him
,
you
'd
twist
him
round
your
little
*NL*
finger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
I
am
expecting
news
,
priceless
news
,
so
I
do
n't
want
Mitya
at
*NL*
all
.
And
he
did
n't
believe
,
I
feel
he
did
n't
,
that
I
should
stay
at
Kuzma
*NL*
Kuzmitch
's
.
He
must
be
in
his
ambush
now
,
behind
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
,
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
watching
for
me
.
And
if
he
's
there
,
he
wo
n't
come
here

so
*NL*
much
the
better

But
I
really
have
been
to
Kuzma
Kuzmitch

,
Mitya
*NL*
escorted
me
there
.
I
told
him
I
should
stay
there
till
midnight

I
*NL*
asked
him
to
be
sure
to
come
at
midnight
to
fetch
me
home

He
went
away
*NL*
and
I
sat
ten
minutes
with
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
and
came
back
here
again

Ugh
,
I
*NL*
was
afraid
,
I
ran
for
fear
of
meeting
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
are
you
so
dressed
up

What
a
curious
cap
you
've
got
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
curious
you
are
yourself

I
tell

the
message
comes
,
I
shall
fly

I
shall
gallop
away
and
you
*NL*
will
see
no
more
of
me

That
's
why
I
am
dressed
up

so
as
to
be
ready

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
are
you
flying
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

know
too
much

you
'll
get
old
too
soon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
You
are
highly
delighted

I
've
never
seen
you
like
this
*NL*
before

You
are
dressed
up
as
if
you
were
going
to
a
ball

Rakitin
looked
*NL*
her
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
you
know
about
balls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
much
about
them
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
a
ball

The
year
before
last
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
's
son
was
*NL*
married
and
I
looked
on
from
the
gallery
.
Do
you
suppose
I
want
to
be
*NL*
talking
to
you
,
Rakitin
,
while
a
prince
like
this
is
standing
here
.
Such
a
*NL*
visitor
!
Alyosha
,
my
dear
boy
,
I
gaze
at
you
and
ca
n't
believe
my
eyes

*NL*
Good
heavens
,
can
you
have
come
here
to
see
me
!
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
*NL*
never
had
a
thought
of
seeing
you
and
I
did
n't
think
that
you
would
ever
*NL*
come
and
see
me
.
Though
this
is
not
the
moment
now
,
I
am
awfully
glad
to
*NL*
see
you

Sit
down
on
the
sofa

here
,
that
's
right
,
my
bright
young
moon

I
*NL*
really
ca
n't
take
it
in
even
now
...
Eh
,
Rakitin
,
if
only
you
had
brought
*NL*
him
yesterday
or
the
day
before
!
But
I
am
glad
as
it
is
!
Perhaps
it
's
*NL*
better
he
has
come
now
,
at
such
a
moment
,
and
not
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gayly
sat
down
beside
Alyosha
on
the
sofa
,
looking
at
him
with
*NL*
positive
delight
.
And
she
really
was
glad
,
she
was
not
lying
when
she
said
*NL*
so
.
Her
eyes
glowed
,
her
lips
laughed
,
but
it
was
a
good-hearted
merry
*NL*
laugh
.
Alyosha
had
not
expected
to
see
such
a
kind
expression
in
her
*NL*
face
...
He
had
hardly
met
her
till
the
day
before
,
he
had
formed
an
*NL*
alarming
idea
of
her
,
and
had
been
horribly
distressed
the
day
before
by
*NL*
the
spiteful
and
treacherous
trick
she
had
played
on
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
He
*NL*
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
her
now
altogether
different
from
what
he
*NL*
had
expected
.
And
,
crushed
as
he
was
by
his
own
sorrow
,
his
eyes
*NL*
involuntarily
rested
on
her
with
attention
.
Her
whole
manner
seemed
*NL*
changed
for
the
better
since
yesterday
,
there
was
scarcely
any
trace
of
*NL*
that
mawkish
sweetness
in
her
speech
,
of
that
voluptuous
softness
in
her
*NL*
movements
.
Everything
was
simple
and
good-natured
,
her
gestures
were
*NL*
rapid
,
direct
,
confiding
,
but
she
was
greatly
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
how
everything
comes
together
to-day
!
''
she
chattered
on
again
.
*NL*
``
And
why
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
Alyosha
,
I
could
n't
say
myself
!
If
you
*NL*
ask
me
,
I
could
n't
tell
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
do
n't
you
know
why
you
're
glad
?
''
said
Rakitin
,
grinning
.
``
You
used
*NL*
to
be
always
pestering
me
to
bring
him
,
you
'd
some
object
,
I
suppose

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
different
object
once
,
but
now
that
's
over
,
this
is
not
the
*NL*
moment

I
say
,
I
want
you
to
have
something
nice
.
I
am
so
good-natured
*NL*
now
.
You
sit
down
,
too
,
Rakitin
;
why
are
you
standing
?
You
've
sat
down
*NL*
already

There
's
no
fear
of
Rakitin
's
forgetting
to
look
after
himself
.
*NL*
Look
,
Alyosha
,
he
's
sitting
there
opposite
us
,
so
offended
that
I
did
n't
*NL*
ask
him
to
sit
down
before
you
.
Ugh
,
Rakitin
is
such
a
one
to
take
*NL*
offense
!
''
laughed
Grushenka
.
``
Do
n't
be
angry
,
Rakitin
,
I
'm
kind
to-day
.
*NL*
Why
are
you
so
depressed
,
Alyosha
?
Are
you
afraid
of
me
?
''
She
peeped
into
*NL*
his
eyes
with
merry
mockery
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
sad
.
The
promotion
has
not
been
given

''
boomed
Rakitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
promotion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
elder
stinks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
You
are
talking
some
nonsense
,
you
want
to
say
something
nasty
.
Be
*NL*
quiet
,
you
stupid
!
Let
me
sit
on
your
knee
,
Alyosha
,
like
this
.
''
She
*NL*
suddenly
skipped
forward
and
jumped
,
laughing
,
on
his
knee
,
like
a
*NL*
nestling
kitten
,
with
her
right
arm
about
his
neck
.
``
I
'll
cheer
you
up
,
my
*NL*
pious
boy
.
Yes
,
really
,
will
you
let
me
sit
on
your
knee
?
You
wo
n't
be
*NL*
angry
?
If
you
tell
me
,
I
'll
get
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
did
not
speak
.
He
sat
afraid
to
move
,
he
heard
her
words
,
``
If
you
*NL*
tell
me
,
I
'll
get
off
,
''
but
he
did
not
answer
.
But
there
was
nothing
in
*NL*
his
heart
such
as
Rakitin
,
for
instance
,
watching
him
malignantly
from
his
*NL*
corner
,
might
have
expected
or
fancied
.
The
great
grief
in
his
heart
*NL*
swallowed
up
every
sensation
that
might
have
been
aroused
,
and
,
if
only
he
*NL*
could
have
thought
clearly
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
realized
that
he
*NL*
had
now
the
strongest
armor
to
protect
him
from
every
lust
and
temptation
.
*NL*
Yet
in
spite
of
the
vague
irresponsiveness
of
his
spiritual
condition
and
*NL*
the
sorrow
that
overwhelmed
him
,
he
could
not
help
wondering
at
a
new
and
*NL*
strange
sensation
in
his
heart
.
This
woman
,
this
``
dreadful
''
woman
,
had
no
*NL*
terror
for
him
now
,
none
of
that
terror
that
had
stirred
in
his
soul
at
*NL*
any
passing
thought
of
woman
.
On
the
contrary
,
this
woman
,
dreaded
above
*NL*
all
women
,
sitting
now
on
his
knee
,
holding
him
in
her
arms
,
aroused
in
*NL*
him
now
a
quite
different
,
unexpected
,
peculiar
feeling
,
a
feeling
of
the
*NL*
intensest
and
purest
interest
without
a
trace
of
fear
,
of
his
former
*NL*
terror
.
That
was
what
instinctively
surprised
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
talked
nonsense
enough
,
''
cried
Rakitin
,
``
you
'd
much
better
give
us
*NL*
some
champagne
.
You
owe
it
me
,
you
know
you
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
really
do
.
Do
you
know

I
promised
him
champagne
on
the
*NL*
top
of
everything

if
he

bring

I
'll
have
some

stingy

I
'll

stand
a
bottle

not
for
you

Rakitin

you
're
a
toadstool

but
he
is
a
*NL*
falcon

And
though
my
heart
is
full
of
something
very
different
,
so
be
it

*NL*
I
'll
drink
with
you

long

Rakitin
put
in
inquisitively
,
doing
his
best
to
pretend
*NL*
not
to
notice
the
snubs
that
were
being
continually
aimed
at
him

*NL*
``
Ech

Grushenka
said
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
suddenly
anxious
,
turning
her
head
towards
Rakitin
,
and
drawing
a
little
*NL*
away
from
Alyosha
,
though
she
still
sat
on
his
knee
with
her
arm
round
his
*NL*
neck

``

up

something

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

Of

am
not
afraid

now

I
am
not
afraid

his
knife

Be
quiet

do
n't
remind
me
of
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

has
bruised
my
heart

*NL*
And
I
do
n't
want
to
think

Grushenka
*NL*
smiled
dreamily
and
a
little
cruel
line
showed
in
her
smile
.
``
Mitya

wanted
to
make
a
conquest

win

me
over
with

No

it

a
good

did
end

that

She
smiled
again

``
But
I
am
still
afraid
of
your
being
angry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that

really
true

Rakitin
put
in
suddenly
with
genuine
surprise

``

is
really
afraid

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
chicken

no

``
Do

me
angry

Grushenka
caught
him
up
hotly
.
``
This
*NL*
is
quite
different

I
love
Alyosha
in
a
different
way

It
's
true

Alyosha

*NL*
I
had
sly
designs
on
you
before
.
For
I
am
a
horrid

violent
creature
.
But
*NL*
at
other
times
I
've
looked
upon
you
,
Alyosha
,
as
my
conscience

I
've
kept
*NL*
thinking
`
how
any
one
like
that
must
despise
a
nasty
thing
like
me

I
*NL*
thought
that
the
day
before
yesterday

as
I
ran
home
from
the
young

I
have
thought
of
you
a
long
time
in

knows

talked

understands

Would
you
believe

it

I
sometimes
look
at

feel
ashamed

utterly
ashamed

myself

how
,
and
since
when

I
began
to
think
about
you

I
ca
n't
say

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
Fenya
came
in
and
put
a
tray
with
an
uncorked
bottle
and
three
glasses
of

champagne
on
the
table

*NL*
*NL*
``

Rakitin

He
went
up
to

took
a
glass

emptied
it
at
one

poured
*NL*
himself
out
another

*NL*
``

licking

No

Rakitin
tauntingly

She
started
up
as
though
in
*NL*
dismay
,
instantly
slipped
off
his
knee
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
bent
a
long
wondering
look
upon
her
and
a
light
seemed
to
dawn
in
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rakitin
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
in
a
firm
and
loud
voice
;
``
do
n't
taunt
me
*NL*
with
having
rebelled
against
God
.
I
do
n't
want
to
feel
angry
with
you

so
*NL*
you
must
be
kinder

too

I
've
lost
a
treasure
such
as
you
have
never
had
,
*NL*
and
you
can
not
judge
me
now

You
had
much
better
look
at
her
--
do
you
see
*NL*
how
she
has
pity
on
me
?
I
came
here
to
find
a
wicked
soul
--
I
felt
drawn
to
*NL*
evil
because
I
was
base
and
evil
myself
,
and
I
've
found
a
true
sister
,
I
*NL*
have
found
a
treasure

a
loving
heart

She
had
pity
on
me
just
now
...
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
I
am
speaking
of
you

You
've
raised
my
soul
from
*NL*
the
depths

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
's
lips
were
quivering
and
he
caught
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
saved
you
,
it
seems
,
''
laughed
Rakitin
spitefully
.
``
And
she
meant
*NL*
to
get
you
in
her
clutches
,
do
you
realize
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
Rakitin
.
''
Grushenka
jumped
up
.
``
Hush
,
both
of
you
.
Now
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
all
about
it
.
Hush
,
Alyosha
,
your
words
make
me
ashamed
,
for
I
am
bad
*NL*
and
not
good
--
that
's
what
I
am
.
And
you
hush
,
Rakitin
,
because
you
are
*NL*
telling
lies
.
I
had
the
low
idea
of
trying
to
get
him
in
my
clutches
,
but
*NL*
now
you
are
lying
,
now
it
's
all
different
.
And
do
n't
let
me
hear
anything
*NL*
more
from
you
,
Rakitin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
Grushenka
said
with
extreme
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
both
crazy
,
''
said
Rakitin
,
looking
at
them
with
amazement
.
``
I
*NL*
feel
as
though
I
were
in
a
madhouse

They
're
both
getting
so
feeble
*NL*
they
'll
begin
crying
in
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
begin
to
cry
,
I
shall
,
''
repeated
Grushenka
.
``
He
called
me
his
*NL*
sister
and
I
shall
never
forget
that
.
Only
let
me
tell
you
,
Rakitin
,
*NL*
though
I
am
bad
,
I
did
give
away
an
onion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
onion
?
Hang
it
all
,
you
really
are
crazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rakitin
wondered
at
their
enthusiasm
.
He
was
aggrieved
and
annoyed
,
though
*NL*
he
might
have
reflected
that
each
of
them
was
just
passing
through
a
*NL*
spiritual
crisis
such
as
does
not
come
often
in
a
lifetime
.
But
though
*NL*
Rakitin
was
very
sensitive
about
everything
that
concerned
himself
,
he
was
*NL*
very
obtuse
as
regards
the
feelings
and
sensations
of
others
--
partly
from
*NL*
his
youth
and
inexperience
,
partly
from
his
intense
egoism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Alyosha
,
''
Grushenka
turned
to
him
with
a
nervous
laugh
.
``
I
was
*NL*
boasting
when
I
told
Rakitin
I
had
given
away
an
onion
,
but
it
's
not
to
*NL*
boast
I
tell
you
about
it
.
It
's
only
a
story
,
but
it
's
a
nice
story
.
I
*NL*
used
to
hear
it
when
I
was
a
child
from
Matryona
,
my
cook
,
who
is
still
*NL*
with
me
.
It
's
like
this
.
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
peasant
woman
and
a
*NL*
very
wicked
woman
she
was
.
And
she
died
and
did
not
leave
a
single
good
*NL*
deed
behind
.
The
devils
caught
her
and
plunged
her
into
the
lake
of
fire
.
*NL*
So
her
guardian
angel
stood
and
wondered
what
good
deed
of
hers
he
could
*NL*
remember
to
tell
to
God
;
`
She
once
pulled
up
an
onion
in
her
garden
,
'
said
*NL*
he
,
`
and
gave
it
to
a
beggar
woman
.
'
And
God
answered
:
`
You
take
that
*NL*
onion
then
,
hold
it
out
to
her
in
the
lake
,
and
let
her
take
hold
and
be
*NL*
pulled
out
.
And
if
you
can
pull
her
out
of
the
lake
,
let
her
come
to
*NL*
Paradise
,
but
if
the
onion
breaks
,
then
the
woman
must
stay
where
she
is
.
'
*NL*
The
angel
ran
to
the
woman
and
held
out
the
onion
to
her
.
`
Come
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
`
catch
hold
and
I
'll
pull
you
out
.
'
And
he
began
cautiously
pulling
her
*NL*
out
.
He
had
just
pulled
her
right
out
,
when
the
other
sinners
in
the
lake
,
*NL*
seeing
how
she
was
being
drawn
out
,
began
catching
hold
of
her
so
as
to
be
*NL*
pulled
out
with
her
.
But
she
was
a
very
wicked
woman
and
she
began
kicking
*NL*
them
.
`
I
'm
to
be
pulled
out
,
not
you
.
It
's
my
onion
,
not
yours
.
'
As
soon
*NL*
as
she
said
that
,
the
onion
broke
.
And
the
woman
fell
into
the
lake
and
*NL*
she
is
burning
there
to
this
day
.
So
the
angel
wept
and
went
away
.
So
*NL*
that
's
the
story
,
Alyosha
;
I
know
it
by
heart
,
for
I
am
that
wicked
woman
*NL*
myself
.
I
boasted
to
Rakitin
that
I
had
given
away
an
onion
,
but
to
you
*NL*
I
'll
say
:
`
I
've
done
nothing
but
give
away
one
onion
all
my
life
,
that
's
*NL*
the
only
good
deed
I
've
done
.
'
So
do
n't
praise
me
,
Alyosha
,
do
n't
think
me
*NL*
good
,
I
am
bad
,
I
am
a
wicked
woman
and
you
make
me
ashamed
if
you
praise
*NL*
me
.
Eh
,
I
must
confess
everything
.
Listen
,
Alyosha
.
I
was
so
anxious
to
*NL*
get
hold
of
you
that
I
promised
Rakitin
twenty-five
roubles
if
he
would
*NL*
bring
you
to
me
.
Stay
,
Rakitin
,
wait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
table
,
opened
a
drawer
,
pulled
out
a
*NL*
purse
and
took
from
it
a
twenty-five
rouble
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
What
nonsense
!
''
cried
Rakitin
,
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
.
Rakitin
,
I
owe
it
you
,
there
's
no
fear
of
your
refusing
it
,
you
*NL*
asked
for
it
yourself
.
''
And
she
threw
the
note
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likely
I
should
refuse
it
,
''
boomed
Rakitin
,
obviously
abashed
,
but
*NL*
carrying
off
his
confusion
with
a
swagger
.
``
That
will
come
in
very
handy
;
*NL*
fools
are
made
for
wise
men
's
profit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
hold
your
tongue
,
Rakitin
,
what
I
am
going
to
say
now
is
not
for
*NL*
your
ears
.
Sit
down
in
that
corner
and
keep
quiet
.
You
do
n't
like
us
,
so
*NL*
hold
your
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
like
you
for
?
''
Rakitin
snarled
,
not
concealing
his
ill
-
*NL*
humor
.
He
put
the
twenty-five
rouble
note
in
his
pocket
and
he
felt
*NL*
ashamed
at
Alyosha
's
seeing
it
.
He
had
reckoned
on
receiving
his
payment
*NL*
later
,
without
Alyosha
's
knowing
of
it
,
and
now
,
feeling
ashamed
,
he
lost
*NL*
his
temper
.
Till
that
moment
he
had
thought
it
discreet
not
to
contradict
*NL*
Grushenka
too
flatly
in
spite
of
her
snubbing
,
since
he
had
something
to
*NL*
get
out
of
her
.
But
now
he
,
too
,
was
angry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
loves
people
for
some
reason
,
but
what
have
either
of
you
done
for
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
love
people
without
a
reason
,
as
Alyosha
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
he
love
you
?
How
has
he
shown
it
,
that
you
make
such
a
fuss
*NL*
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
;
she
spoke
with
heat
and
*NL*
there
were
hysterical
notes
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Rakitin
,
you
know
nothing
about
us
!
And
do
n't
dare
to
speak
to
me
*NL*
like
that
again
.
How
dare
you
be
so
familiar
!
Sit
in
that
corner
and
be
*NL*
quiet
,
as
though
you
were
my
footman
!
And
now
,
Alyosha
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
*NL*
whole
truth
,
that
you
may
see
what
a
wretch
I
am
!
I
am
not
talking
to
*NL*
Rakitin
,
but
to
you
.
I
wanted
to
ruin
you
,
Alyosha
,
that
's
the
holy
truth
;
*NL*
I
quite
meant
to
.
I
wanted
to
so
much
,
that
I
bribed
Rakitin
to
bring
you
.
*NL*
And
why
did
I
want
to
do
such
a
thing
?
You
knew
nothing
about
it
,
Alyosha
,
*NL*
you
turned
away
from
me
;
if
you
passed
me
,
you
dropped
your
eyes
.
And
I
've
*NL*
looked
at
you
a
hundred
times
before
to-day
;
I
began
asking
every
one
*NL*
about
you
.
Your
face
haunted
my
heart
.
`
He
despises
me
,
'
I
thought
;
`
he
*NL*
wo
n't
even
look
at
me
.
'
And
I
felt
it
so
much
at
last
that
I
wondered
at
*NL*
myself
for
being
so
frightened
of
a
boy
.
I
'll
get
him
in
my
clutches
and
*NL*
laugh
at
him
.
I
was
full
of
spite
and
anger
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
nobody
*NL*
here
dares
talk
or
think
of
coming
to
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
with
any
evil
*NL*
purpose
.
Old
Kuzma
is
the
only
man
I
have
anything
to
do
with
here
;
I
was
*NL*
bound
and
sold
to
him
;
Satan
brought
us
together
,
but
there
has
been
no
*NL*
one
else
.
But
looking
at
you
,
I
thought
,
I
'll
get
him
in
my
clutches
and
*NL*
laugh
at
him
.
You
see
what
a
spiteful
cur
I
am
,
and
you
called
me
your
*NL*
sister
!
And
now
that
man
who
wronged
me
has
come
;
I
sit
here
waiting
for
a
*NL*
message
from
him
.
And
do
you
know
what
that
man
has
been
to
me
?
Five
years
*NL*
ago
,
when
Kuzma
brought
me
here
,
I
used
to
shut
myself
up
,
that
no
one
*NL*
might
have
sight
or
sound
of
me
.
I
was
a
silly
slip
of
a
girl
;
I
used
to
*NL*
sit
here
sobbing
;
I
used
to
lie
awake
all
night
,
thinking
:
`
Where
is
he
*NL*
now
,
the
man
who
wronged
me
?
He
is
laughing
at
me
with
another
woman
,
most
*NL*
likely
.
If
only
I
could
see
him
,
if
I
could
meet
him
again
,
I
'd
pay
him
*NL*
out
,
I
'd
pay
him
out
!
'
At
night
I
used
to
lie
sobbing
into
my
pillow
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
and
I
used
to
brood
over
it
;
I
used
to
tear
my
heart
on
purpose
*NL*
and
gloat
over
my
anger
.
`
I
'll
pay
him
out
,
I
'll
pay
him
out
!
'
That
's
what
*NL*
I
used
to
cry
out
in
the
dark
.
And
when
I
suddenly
thought
that
I
should
*NL*
really
do
nothing
to
him
,
and
that
he
was
laughing
at
me
then
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
had
utterly
forgotten
me
,
I
would
fling
myself
on
the
floor
,
melt
into
*NL*
helpless
tears
,
and
lie
there
shaking
till
dawn
.
In
the
morning
I
would
*NL*
get
up
more
spiteful
than
a
dog
,
ready
to
tear
the
whole
world
to
pieces
.
*NL*
And
then
what
do
you
think
?
I
began
saving
money
,
I
became
hard-hearted
,
*NL*
grew
stout
--
grew
wiser
,
would
you
say
?
No
,
no
one
in
the
whole
world
sees
*NL*
it
,
no
one
knows
it
,
but
when
night
comes
on
,
I
sometimes
lie
as
I
did
*NL*
five
years
ago
,
when
I
was
a
silly
girl
,
clenching
my
teeth
and
crying
all
*NL*
night
,
thinking
,
`
I
'll
pay
him
out
,
I
'll
pay
him
out
!
'
Do
you
hear
?
Well
*NL*
then
,
now
you
understand
me
.
A
month
ago
a
letter
came
to
me
--
he
was
*NL*
coming
,
he
was
a
widower
,
he
wanted
to
see
me
.
It
took
my
breath
away
;
*NL*
then
I
suddenly
thought
:
`
If
he
comes
and
whistles
to
call
me
,
I
shall
*NL*
creep
back
to
him
like
a
beaten
dog
.
'
I
could
n't
believe
myself
.
Am
I
so
*NL*
abject
?
Shall
I
run
to
him
or
not
?
And
I
've
been
in
such
a
rage
with
*NL*
myself
all
this
month
that
I
am
worse
than
I
was
five
years
ago
.
Do
you
*NL*
see
now
,
Alyosha
,
what
a
violent
,
vindictive
creature
I
am
?
I
have
shown
*NL*
you
the
whole
truth
!
I
played
with
Mitya
to
keep
me
from
running
to
that
*NL*
other
.
Hush
,
Rakitin
,
it
's
not
for
you
to
judge
me
,
I
am
not
speaking
to
*NL*
you
.
Before
you
came
in
,
I
was
lying
here
waiting
,
brooding
,
deciding
my
*NL*
whole
future
life
,
and
you
can
never
know
what
was
in
my
heart
.
Yes
,
*NL*
Alyosha
,
tell
your
young
lady
not
to
be
angry
with
me
for
what
happened
*NL*
the
day
before
yesterday
...
Nobody
in
the
whole
world
knows
what
I
am
*NL*
going
through
now
,
and
no
one
ever
can
know
...
For
perhaps
I
shall
take
a
*NL*
knife
with
me
to-day
,
I
ca
n't
make
up
my
mind
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
``
tragic
''
phrase
Grushenka
broke
down
,
hid
her
face
in
her
*NL*
hands
,
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
pillows
,
and
sobbed
like
a
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
got
up
and
went
to
Rakitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Misha
,
''
he
said
,
``
do
n't
be
angry
.
She
wounded
you
,
but
do
n't
be
angry
.
*NL*
You
heard
what
she
said
just
now
?
You
must
n't
ask
too
much
of
human
*NL*
endurance
,
one
must
be
merciful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
said
this
at
the
instinctive
prompting
of
his
heart
.
He
felt
*NL*
obliged
to
speak
and
he
turned
to
Rakitin
.
If
Rakitin
had
not
been
there
,
*NL*
he
would
have
spoken
to
the
air
.
But
Rakitin
looked
at
him
ironically
and
*NL*
Alyosha
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
so
primed
up
with
your
elder
's
teaching
last
night
that
now
you
*NL*
have
to
let
it
off
on
me
,
Alexey
,
man
of
God
!
''
said
Rakitin
,
with
a
smile
*NL*
of
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
laugh
,
Rakitin
,
do
n't
smile
,
do
n't
talk
of
the
dead
--
he
was
better
*NL*
than
any
one
in
the
world
!
''
cried
Alyosha
,
with
tears
in
his
voice
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
speak
to
you
as
a
judge
but
as
the
lowest
of
the
judged
.
What
am
I
*NL*
beside
her
?
I
came
here
seeking
my
ruin
,
and
said
to
myself
,
`
What
does
it
*NL*
matter
?
'
in
my
cowardliness
,
but
she
,
after
five
years
in
torment
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
any
one
says
a
word
from
the
heart
to
her
--
it
makes
her
forget
*NL*
everything
,
forgive
everything
,
in
her
tears
!
The
man
who
has
wronged
her
*NL*
has
come
back
,
he
sends
for
her
and
she
forgives
him
everything
,
and
*NL*
hastens
joyfully
to
meet
him
and
she
wo
n't
take
a
knife
with
her
.
She
*NL*
wo
n't
!
No
,
I
am
not
like
that
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
are
,
Misha
,
but
I
*NL*
am
not
like
that
.
It
's
a
lesson
to
me
...
She
is
more
loving
than
we
...
*NL*
Have
you
heard
her
speak
before
of
what
she
has
just
told
us
?
No
,
you
*NL*
have
n't
;
if
you
had
,
you
'd
have
understood
her
long
ago
...
and
the
person
*NL*
insulted
the
day
before
yesterday
must
forgive
her
,
too
!
She
will
,
when
*NL*
she
knows
...
and
she
shall
know
...
This
soul
is
not
yet
at
peace
with
*NL*
itself
,
one
must
be
tender
with
it
...
there
may
be
a
treasure
in
that
*NL*
soul
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
stopped
,
because
he
caught
his
breath
.
In
spite
of
his
ill-humor
*NL*
Rakitin
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
.
He
had
never
expected
such
a
*NL*
tirade
from
the
gentle
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
found
some
one
to
plead
her
cause
!
Why
,
are
you
in
love
with
her
?
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
our
monk
's
really
in
love
with
you
,
you
've
made
a
*NL*
conquest
!
''
he
cried
,
with
a
coarse
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
lifted
her
head
from
the
pillow
and
looked
at
Alyosha
with
a
*NL*
tender
smile
shining
on
her
tear-stained
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
alone
,
Alyosha
,
my
cherub
;
you
see
what
he
is

he
is
not
a
person
*NL*
for
you
to
speak
to
.
Mihail
Osipovitch
,
''
she
turned
to
Rakitin
,
``
I
meant
*NL*
to
beg
your
pardon
for
being
rude
to
you
,
but
now
I
do
n't
want
to
.
*NL*
Alyosha
,
come
to
me
,
sit
down
here

She
beckoned
to
him
with
a
happy
*NL*
smile
.
``
That
's
right
,
sit
here
.
Tell
me
,
''
she
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
peeped
into
his
face
,
smiling
,
``
tell
me
,
do
I
love
that
man

the
*NL*
man
who
wronged

Before
you
came
,
I
lay
here
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
asking
my
heart
whether
I
loved
him
.
Decide
for
me
,
Alyosha
,
the
*NL*
time
has
come

it
shall
be
as
you
say

Am
I
to
forgive

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
forgiven
him
already

said
Alyosha
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
really
have
forgiven
him

Grushenka
murmured
thoughtfully
.
``
What
*NL*
an
abject
heart
!
To
my
abject
heart
!

She
snatched
up
a
glass
from
the
*NL*
table
,
emptied
it
at
a
gulp
,
lifted
it
in
the
air
and
flung
it
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
The
glass
broke
with
a
crash
.
A
little
cruel
line
came
into
her
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
have
n't
forgiven
him
,
though

''
she
said
,
with
a
sort
of
menace
*NL*
in
her
voice
,
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
ground
as
though
she
were
*NL*
talking
to
herself
.
``
Perhaps
my
heart
is
only
getting
ready
to
forgive

I
*NL*
shall
struggle
with
my
heart

You
see
,
Alyosha
,
I
've
grown
to
love
my
*NL*
tears
in
these
five
years

Perhaps
I
only
love
my
resentment

not
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
n't
care
to
be
in
his
shoes

hissed
Rakitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

black
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo

he

Then
why

you
dressed
up

Rakitin

with
a
*NL*
venomous
sneer

*NL*

He
left

a
thin

Grushenka
finished
with
a
malicious
laugh

uttered
the

hysterical
scream

broke
down
again

hid
her
face

buried

up

some
one
*NL*
like
you
would
come
and
forgive
me
.
I
believed
that
,
nasty
as
I
am
,
some
*NL*
one
would
really
love
me
,
not
only
with
a
shameful
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
''
answered
Alyosha
,
bending
over
her
with
a
*NL*
tender
smile
,
and
gently
taking
her
by
the
hands
;
``
I
only
gave
you
an
*NL*
onion
,
nothing
but
a
tiny
little
onion
,
that
was
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
moved
to
tears
himself
as
he
said
it
.
At
that
moment
there
was
a
*NL*
sudden
noise
in
the
passage
,
some
one
came
into
the
hall
.
Grushenka
jumped
*NL*
up
,
seeming
greatly
alarmed
.
Fenya
ran
noisily
into
the
room
,
crying
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
,
mistress
darling
,
a
messenger
has
galloped
up
,
''
she
cried
,
*NL*
breathless
and
joyful
.
``
A
carriage
from
Mokroe
for
you
,
Timofey
the
*NL*
driver
,
with
three
horses
,
they
are
just
putting
in
fresh
horses
...
A
*NL*
letter
,
here
's
the
letter
,
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
was
in
her
hand
and
she
waved
it
in
the
air
all
the
while
she
*NL*
talked
.
Grushenka
snatched
the
letter
from
her
and
carried
it
to
the
*NL*
candle
.
It
was
only
a
note
,
a
few
lines
.
She
read
it
in
one
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
sent
for
me
,
''
she
cried
,
her
face
white
and
distorted
,
with
a
wan
*NL*
smile
;
``
he
whistles
!
Crawl
back
,
little
dog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
only
for
one
instant
she
stood
as
though
hesitating
;
suddenly
the
*NL*
blood
rushed
to
her
head
and
sent
a
glow
to
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
,
''
she
cried
;
``
five
years
of
my
life
!
Good-by
!
Good-by
,
Alyosha
,
*NL*
my
fate
is
sealed
.
Go
,
go
,
leave
me
all
of
you
,
do
n't
let
me
see
you
*NL*
again
!
Grushenka
is
flying
to
a
new
life
...
Do
n't
you
remember
evil
*NL*
against
me
either
,
Rakitin
.
I
may
be
going
to
my
death
!
Ugh
!
I
feel
as
*NL*
though
I
were
drunk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
suddenly
left
them
and
ran
into
her
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
has
no
thoughts
for
us
now
!
''
grumbled
Rakitin
.
``
Let
's
go
,
or
we
*NL*
may
hear
that
feminine
shriek
again
.
I
am
sick
of
all
these
tears
and
*NL*
cries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
mechanically
let
himself
be
led
out
.
In
the
yard
stood
a
covered
*NL*
cart
.
Horses
were
being
taken
out
of
the
shafts
,
men
were
running
to
and
*NL*
fro
with
a
lantern
.
Three
fresh
horses
were
being
led
in
at
the
open
gate
.
*NL*
But
when
Alyosha
and
Rakitin
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
,
Grushenka
's
*NL*
bedroom
window
was
suddenly
opened
and
she
called
in
a
ringing
voice
after
*NL*
Alyosha
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
give
my
greetings
to
your
brother
Mitya
and
tell
him
not
to
*NL*
remember
evil
against
me
,
though
I
have
brought
him
misery
.
And
tell
him
,
*NL*
too
,
in
my
words
:
`
Grushenka
has
fallen
to
a
scoundrel
,
and
not
to
you
,
*NL*
noble
heart
.
'
And
add
,
too
,
that
Grushenka
loved
him
only
one
hour
,
only
*NL*
one
short
hour
she
loved
him
--
so
let
him
remember
that
hour
all
his
*NL*
life
--
say
,
`
Grushenka
tells
you
to
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ended
in
a
voice
full
of
sobs
.
The
window
was
shut
with
a
slam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
,
h
'm
!
''
growled
Rakitin
,
laughing
,
``
she
murders
your
brother
Mitya
and
*NL*
then
tells
him
to
remember
it
all
his
life
!
What
ferocity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
made
no
reply
,
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
.
He
walked
fast
beside
*NL*
Rakitin
as
though
in
a
terrible
hurry
.
He
was
lost
in
thought
and
moved
*NL*
mechanically
.
Rakitin
felt
a
sudden
twinge
as
though
he
had
been
touched
*NL*
on
an
open
wound
.
He
had
expected
something
quite
different
by
bringing
*NL*
Grushenka
and
Alyosha
together
.
Something
very
different
from
what
he
had
*NL*
hoped
for
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
Pole
,
that
officer
of
hers
,
''
he
began
again
,
restraining
himself
;
*NL*
``
and
indeed
he
is
not
an
officer
at
all
now
.
He
served
in
the
customs
in
*NL*
Siberia
,
somewhere
on
the
Chinese
frontier
,
some
puny
little
beggar
of
a
*NL*
Pole
,
I
expect
.
Lost
his
job
,
they
say
.
He
's
heard
now
that
Grushenka
's
*NL*
saved
a
little
money
,
so
he
's
turned
up
again
--
that
's
the
explanation
of
*NL*
the
mystery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Alyosha
seemed
not
to
hear
.
Rakitin
could
not
control
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
you
've
saved
the
sinner
?
''
he
laughed
spitefully
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
turned
the
Magdalene
into
the
true
path
?
Driven
out
the
seven
devils
,
eh
?
*NL*
So
you
see
the
miracles
you
were
looking
out
for
just
now
have
come
to
*NL*
pass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Rakitin
,
''
Alyosha
answered
with
an
aching
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
despise
me
now
for
those
twenty-five
roubles
?
I
've
sold
my
friend
,
*NL*
you
think
.
But
you
are
not
Christ
,
you
know
,
and
I
am
not
Judas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Rakitin
,
I
assure
you
I
'd
forgotten
about
it
,
''
cried
Alyosha
,
``
you
*NL*
remind
me
of
it
yourself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
the
last
straw
for
Rakitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damnation
take
you
all
and
each
of
you
!
''
he
cried
suddenly
,
``
why
the
*NL*
devil
did
I
take
you
up
?
I
do
n't
want
to
know
you
from
this
time
forward
.
*NL*
Go
alone
,
there
's
your
road
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
turned
abruptly
into
another
street
,
leaving
Alyosha
alone
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
Alyosha
came
out
of
the
town
and
walked
across
the
fields
to
the
*NL*
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
IV
.
Cana
Of
Galilee
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
late
,
according
to
the
monastery
ideas
,
when
Alyosha
returned
*NL*
to
the
hermitage
;
the
door-keeper
let
him
in
by
a
special
entrance
.
It
had
*NL*
struck
nine
o'clock
--
the
hour
of
rest
and
repose
after
a
day
of
such
*NL*
agitation
for
all
.
Alyosha
timidly
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
*NL*
elder
's
cell
where
his
coffin
was
now
standing
.
There
was
no
one
in
the
*NL*
cell
but
Father
Paissy
,
reading
the
Gospel
in
solitude
over
the
coffin
,
*NL*
and
the
young
novice
Porfiry
,
who
,
exhausted
by
the
previous
night
's
*NL*
conversation
and
the
disturbing
incidents
of
the
day
,
was
sleeping
the
*NL*
deep
sound
sleep
of
youth
on
the
floor
of
the
other
room
.
Though
Father
*NL*
Paissy
heard
Alyosha
come
in
,
he
did
not
even
look
in
his
direction
.
*NL*
Alyosha
turned
to
the
right
from
the
door
to
the
corner
,
fell
on
his
knees
*NL*
and
began
to
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
soul
was
overflowing
but
with
mingled
feelings
;
no
single
sensation
*NL*
stood
out
distinctly
;
on
the
contrary
,
one
drove
out
another
in
a
slow
,
*NL*
continual
rotation
.
But
there
was
a
sweetness
in
his
heart
and
,
strange
to
*NL*
say
,
Alyosha
was
not
surprised
at
it
.
Again
he
saw
that
coffin
before
him
,
*NL*
the
hidden
dead
figure
so
precious
to
him
,
but
the
weeping
and
poignant
*NL*
grief
of
the
morning
was
no
longer
aching
in
his
soul
.
As
soon
as
he
came
*NL*
in
,
he
fell
down
before
the
coffin
as
before
a
holy
shrine
,
but
joy
,
joy
*NL*
was
glowing
in
his
mind
and
in
his
heart
.
The
one
window
of
the
cell
was
*NL*
open
,
the
air
was
fresh
and
cool
.
``
So
the
smell
must
have
become
stronger
,
*NL*
if
they
opened
the
window
,
''
thought
Alyosha
.
But
even
this
thought
of
the
*NL*
smell
of
corruption
,
which
had
seemed
to
him
so
awful
and
humiliating
a
*NL*
few
hours
before
,
no
longer
made
him
feel
miserable
or
indignant
.
He
began
*NL*
quietly
praying
,
but
he
soon
felt
that
he
was
praying
almost
mechanically
.
*NL*
Fragments
of
thought
floated
through
his
soul
,
flashed
like
stars
and
went
*NL*
out
again
at
once
,
to
be
succeeded
by
others
.
But
yet
there
was
reigning
*NL*
in
his
soul
a
sense
of
the
wholeness
of
things
--
something
steadfast
and
*NL*
comforting
--
and
he
was
aware
of
it
himself
.
Sometimes
he
began
praying
*NL*
ardently
,
he
longed
to
pour
out
his
thankfulness
and
love
...
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
had
begun
to
pray
,
he
passed
suddenly
to
something
else
,
and
*NL*
sank
into
thought
,
forgetting
both
the
prayer
and
what
had
interrupted
it
.
*NL*
He
began
listening
to
what
Father
Paissy
was
reading
,
but
worn
out
with
*NL*
exhaustion
he
gradually
began
to
doze
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
And
the
third
day
there
was
a
marriage
in
Cana
of
Galilee
;
_
''
read
Father
*NL*
Paissy
.
''
_
And
the
mother
of
Jesus
was
there
;
And
both
Jesus
was
called
,
*NL*
and
his
disciples
,
to
the
marriage
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marriage
?
What
's
that
?
...
A
marriage
!
''
floated
whirling
through
Alyosha
's
*NL*
mind
.
``
There
is
happiness
for
her
,
too
...
She
has
gone
to
the
feast
...
*NL*
No
,
she
has
not
taken
the
knife
...
That
was
only
a
tragic
phrase
...
Well
*NL*
...
tragic
phrases
should
be
forgiven
,
they
must
be
.
Tragic
phrases

comfort
the
heart

Without
them
,
sorrow
would
be
too
heavy
for
men
to
*NL*
bear
.
Rakitin
has
gone
off
to
the
back
alley
.
As
long
as
Rakitin
broods
*NL*
over
his
wrongs
,
he
will
always
go
off
to
the
back
alley
...
But
the
high
*NL*
road
...
The
road
is
wide
and
straight
and
bright
as
crystal
,
and
the
sun
*NL*
is
at
the
end
of
it

Ah

wanted
wine

!
...
He
here
,
too
?
But
he
's
in
the
coffin
...
but
he
's
here
,
too
.
He
*NL*
has
stood
up
,
he
sees
me
,
he
is
coming
here
...
God
!
''
...
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
he
came
up
to
him
,
to
him
,
he
,
the
little
,
thin
old
man
,
with
tiny
*NL*
wrinkles
on
his
face
,
joyful
and
laughing
softly
.
There
was
no
coffin
now
,
*NL*
and
he
was
in
the
same
dress
as
he
had
worn
yesterday
sitting
with
them
,
*NL*
when
the
visitors
had
gathered
about
him
.
His
face
was
uncovered
,
his
eyes
*NL*
were
shining
.
How
was
this
,
then
?
He
,
too
,
had
been
called
to
the
feast
.
*NL*
He
,
too
,
at
the
marriage
of
Cana
in
Galilee
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
I
am
called
,
too
,
called
and
bidden
,
''
he
heard
a
soft
voice
*NL*
saying
over
him
.
``
Why
have
you
hidden
yourself
here
,
out
of
sight
?
You
*NL*
come
and
join
us
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
voice
,
the
voice
of
Father
Zossima
.
And
it
must
be
he
,
since
he
*NL*
called
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
raised
Alyosha
by
the
hand
and
he
rose
from
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
rejoicing
,
''
the
little
,
thin
old
man
went
on
.
``
We
are
drinking
the
*NL*
new
wine
,
the
wine
of
new
,
great
gladness
;
do
you
see
how
many
guests
?
*NL*
Here
are
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
here
is
the
wise
governor
of
the
feast
,
*NL*
he
is
tasting
the
new
wine
.
Why
do
you
wonder
at
me
?
I
gave
an
onion
to
a
*NL*
beggar
,
so
I
,
too
,
am
here
.
And
many
here
have
given
only
an
onion
*NL*
each
--
only
one
little
onion
...
What
are
all
our
deeds
?
And
you
,
my
gentle
*NL*
one
,
you
,
my
kind
boy
,
you
too
have
known
how
to
give
a
famished
woman
an
*NL*
onion
to-day

Begin
your

begin
it

gentle
one

Do
you

Sun

do
you
see
Him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid

I
dare
not
look

''
whispered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
fear
Him
.
He
is
terrible
in
His
greatness
,
awful
in
His
sublimity
,
*NL*
but
infinitely
merciful
.
He
has
made
Himself
like
unto
us
from
love
and
*NL*
rejoices
with
us
.
He
is
changing
the
water
into
wine
that
the
gladness
of
*NL*
the
guests
may
not
be
cut
short
.
He
is
expecting
new
guests
,
He
is
calling
*NL*
new
ones
unceasingly
for
ever
and
ever
...
There
they
are
bringing
new
*NL*
wine

Do
you
see
they
are
bringing
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
glowed
in
Alyosha
's
heart
,
something
filled
it
till
it
ached
,
*NL*
tears
of
rapture
rose
from
his
soul
...
He
stretched
out
his
hands
,
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
and
waked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
coffin
,
the
open
window
,
and
the
soft
,
solemn
,
distinct
reading
*NL*
of
the
Gospel
.
But
Alyosha
did
not
listen
to
the
reading
.
It
was
strange
,
*NL*
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
his
knees
,
but
now
he
was
on
his
feet
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
,
as
though
thrown
forward
,
with
three
firm
rapid
steps
he
went
*NL*
right
up
to
the
coffin
.
His
shoulder
brushed
against
Father
Paissy
without
*NL*
his
noticing
it
.
Father
Paissy
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
from
his
*NL*
book
,
but
looked
away
again
at
once
,
seeing
that
something
strange
was
*NL*
happening
to
the
boy
.
Alyosha
gazed
for
half
a
minute
at
the
coffin
,
at
*NL*
the
covered
,
motionless
dead
man
that
lay
in
the
coffin
,
with
the
ikon
on
*NL*
his
breast
and
the
peaked
cap
with
the
octangular
cross
,
on
his
head
.
He
*NL*
had
only
just
been
hearing
his
voice
,
and
that
voice
was
still
ringing
in
*NL*
his
ears
.
He
was
listening
,
still
expecting
other
words
,
but
suddenly
he
*NL*
turned
sharply
and
went
out
of
the
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
stop
on
the
steps
either
,
but
went
quickly
down
;
his
soul
,
*NL*
overflowing
with
rapture
,
yearned
for
freedom
,
space
,
openness
.
The
vault
*NL*
of
heaven
,
full
of
soft
,
shining
stars
,
stretched
vast
and
fathomless
*NL*
above
him
.
The
Milky
Way
ran
in
two
pale
streams
from
the
zenith
to
the
*NL*
horizon
.
The
fresh
,
motionless
,
still
night
enfolded
the
earth
.
The
white
*NL*
towers
and
golden
domes
of
the
cathedral
gleamed
out
against
the
sapphire
*NL*
sky
.
The
gorgeous
autumn
flowers
,
in
the
beds
round
the
house
,
were
*NL*
slumbering
till
morning
.
The
silence
of
earth
seemed
to
melt
into
the
*NL*
silence
of
the
heavens
.
The
mystery
of
earth
was
one
with
the
mystery
of
*NL*
the
stars
...
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
stood
,
gazed
,
and
suddenly
threw
himself
down
on
the
earth
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
why
he
embraced
it
.
He
could
not
have
told
why
he
longed
so
*NL*
irresistibly
to
kiss
it
,
to
kiss
it
all
.
But
he
kissed
it
weeping
,
sobbing
*NL*
and
watering
it
with
his
tears
,
and
vowed
passionately
to
love
it
,
to
love
*NL*
it
for
ever
and
ever
.
``
Water
the
earth
with
the
tears
of
your
joy
and
love
*NL*
those
tears
,
''
echoed
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
weeping
over
?
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
in
his
rapture
he
was
weeping
even
over
those
stars
,
which
were
*NL*
shining
to
him
from
the
abyss
of
space
,
and
``
he
was
not
ashamed
of
that
*NL*
ecstasy
.
''
There
seemed
to
be
threads
from
all
those
innumerable
worlds
of
*NL*
God
,
linking
his
soul
to
them
,
and
it
was
trembling
all
over
``
in
contact
*NL*
with
other
worlds
.
''
He
longed
to
forgive
every
one
and
for
everything
,
and
*NL*
to
beg
forgiveness
.
Oh
,
not
for
himself
,
but
for
all
men
,
for
all
and
for
*NL*
everything
.
``
And
others
are
praying
for
me
too
,
''
echoed
again
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
But
with
every
instant
he
felt
clearly
and
,
as
it
were
,
tangibly
,
that
*NL*
something
firm
and
unshakable
as
that
vault
of
heaven
had
entered
into
his
*NL*
soul
.
It
was
as
though
some
idea
had
seized
the
sovereignty
of
his
*NL*
mind
--
and
it
was
for
all
his
life
and
for
ever
and
ever
.
He
had
fallen
on
*NL*
the
earth
a
weak
boy
,
but
he
rose
up
a
resolute
champion
,
and
he
knew
and
*NL*
felt
it
suddenly
at
the
very
moment
of
his
ecstasy
.
And
never
,
never
,
all
*NL*
his
life
long
,
could
Alyosha
forget
that
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
visited
my
soul
in
that
hour
,
''
he
used
to
say
afterwards
,
with
*NL*
implicit
faith
in
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
three
days
he
left
the
monastery
in
accordance
with
the
words
of
*NL*
his
elder
,
who
had
bidden
him
``
sojourn
in
the
world
.

Kuzma

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dmitri
,
to
whom
Grushenka
,
flying
away
to
a
new
life
,
had
left
her
*NL*
last
greetings
,
bidding
him
remember
the
hour
of
her
love
for
ever
,
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
what
had
happened
to
her
,
and
was
at
that
moment
in
a
condition
*NL*
of
feverish
agitation
and
activity
.
For
the
last
two
days
he
had
been
in
*NL*
such
an
inconceivable
state
of
mind
that
he
might
easily
have
fallen
ill
*NL*
with
brain
fever
,
as
he
said
himself
afterwards
.
Alyosha
had
not
been
able
*NL*
to
find
him
the
morning
before
,
and
Ivan
had
not
succeeded
in
meeting
him
*NL*
at
the
tavern
on
the
same
day
.
The
people
at
his
lodgings
,
by
his
orders
,
*NL*
concealed
his
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spent
those
two
days
literally
rushing
in
all
directions
,
*NL*
``
struggling
with
his
destiny
and
trying
to
save
himself
,
''
as
he
expressed
*NL*
it
himself
afterwards
,
and
for
some
hours
he
even
made
a
dash
out
of
the
*NL*
town
on
urgent
business
,
terrible
as
it
was
to
him
to
lose
sight
of
*NL*
Grushenka
for
a
moment
.
All
this
was
explained
afterwards
in
detail
,
and
*NL*
confirmed
by
documentary
evidence
;
but
for
the
present
we
will
only
note
*NL*
the
most
essential
incidents
of
those
two
terrible
days
immediately
*NL*
preceding
the
awful
catastrophe
,
that
broke
so
suddenly
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Grushenka
had
,
it
is
true
,
loved
him
for
an
hour
,
genuinely
and
*NL*
sincerely
,
yet
she
tortured
him
sometimes
cruelly
and
mercilessly
.
The
*NL*
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
never
tell
what
she
meant
to
do
.
To
prevail
*NL*
upon
her
by
force
or
kindness
was
also
impossible
:
she
would
yield
to
*NL*
nothing
.
She
would
only
have
become
angry
and
turned
away
from
him
*NL*
altogether
,
he
knew
that
well
already
.
He
suspected
,
quite
correctly
,
that
*NL*
she
,
too
,
was
passing
through
an
inward
struggle
,
and
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
extraordinary
indecision
,
that
she
was
making
up
her
mind
to
something
,
*NL*
and
unable
to
determine
upon
it
.
And
so
,
not
without
good
reason
,
he
*NL*
divined
,
with
a
sinking
heart
,
that
at
moments
she
must
simply
hate
him
*NL*
and
his
passion
.
And
so
,
perhaps
,
it
was
,
but
what
was
distressing
*NL*
Grushenka
he
did
not
understand
.
For
him
the
whole
tormenting
question
lay
*NL*
between
him
and
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
we
must
note
,
by
the
way
,
one
certain
fact
:
he
was
firmly
persuaded
*NL*
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
would
offer
,
or
perhaps
had
offered
,
Grushenka
*NL*
lawful
wedlock
,
and
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
the
old
voluptuary
*NL*
hoped
to
gain
his
object
for
three
thousand
roubles
.
Mitya
had
reached
*NL*
this
conclusion
from
his
knowledge
of
Grushenka
and
her
character
.
That
*NL*
was
how
it
was
that
he
could
believe
at
times
that
all
Grushenka
's
*NL*
uneasiness
rose
from
not
knowing
which
of
them
to
choose
,
which
was
most
*NL*
to
her
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
during
those
days
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
think
of
the
*NL*
approaching
return
of
the
``
officer
,
''
that
is
,
of
the
man
who
had
been
such
*NL*
a
fatal
influence
in
Grushenka
's
life
,
and
whose
arrival
she
was
expecting
*NL*
with
such
emotion
and
dread
.
It
is
true
that
of
late
Grushenka
had
been
*NL*
very
silent
about
it
.
Yet
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
a
letter
she
had
*NL*
received
a
month
ago
from
her
seducer
,
and
had
heard
of
it
from
her
own
*NL*
lips
.
He
partly
knew
,
too
,
what
the
letter
contained
.
In
a
moment
of
spite
*NL*
Grushenka
had
shown
him
that
letter
,
but
to
her
astonishment
he
attached
*NL*
hardly
any
consequence
to
it
.
It
would
be
hard
to
say
why
this
was
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
weighed
down
by
all
the
hideous
horror
of
his
struggle
with
his
*NL*
own
father
for
this
woman
,
he
was
incapable
of
imagining
any
danger
more
*NL*
terrible
,
at
any
rate
for
the
time
.
He
simply
did
not
believe
in
a
suitor
*NL*
who
suddenly
turned
up
again
after
five
years
'
disappearance
,
still
less
*NL*
in
his
speedy
arrival
.
Moreover
,
in
the
``
officer
's
''
first
letter
which
had
*NL*
been
shown
to
Mitya
,
the
possibility
of
his
new
rival
's
visit
was
very
*NL*
vaguely
suggested
.
The
letter
was
very
indefinite
,
high-flown
,
and
full
of
*NL*
sentimentality
.
It
must
be
noted
that
Grushenka
had
concealed
from
him
the
*NL*
last
lines
of
the
letter
,
in
which
his
return
was
alluded
to
more
*NL*
definitely
.
He
had
,
besides
,
noticed
at
that
moment
,
he
remembered
*NL*
afterwards
,
a
certain
involuntary
proud
contempt
for
this
missive
from
*NL*
Siberia
on
Grushenka
's
face
.
Grushenka
told
him
nothing
of
what
had
passed
*NL*
later
between
her
and
this
rival
;
so
that
by
degrees
he
had
completely
*NL*
forgotten
the
officer
's
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
whatever
might
come
later
,
whatever
turn
things
might
take
,
*NL*
his
final
conflict
with
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
close
upon
him
,
and
must
be
*NL*
decided
before
anything
else
.
With
a
sinking
heart
he
was
expecting
every
*NL*
moment
Grushenka
's
decision
,
always
believing
that
it
would
come
suddenly
,
*NL*
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
.
All
of
a
sudden
she
would
say
to
him
:
``
Take
*NL*
me
,
I
'm
yours
for
ever
,
''
and
it
would
all
be
over
.
He
would
seize
her
and
*NL*
bear
her
away
at
once
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
Oh
,
then
he
would
bear
her
*NL*
away
at
once
,
as
far
,
far
away
as
possible
;
to
the
farthest
end
of
Russia
,
*NL*
if
not
of
the
earth
,
then
he
would
marry
her
,
and
settle
down
with
her
*NL*
incognito
,
so
that
no
one
would
know
anything
about
them
,
there
,
here
,
or
*NL*
anywhere
.
Then
,
oh
,
then
,
a
new
life
would
begin
at
once
!
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
different
,
reformed
and
``
virtuous
''
life
-LRB-
``
it
must
,
it
must
be
*NL*
virtuous
''
-RRB-
he
dreamed
feverishly
at
every
moment
.
He
thirsted
for
that
*NL*
reformation
and
renewal
.
The
filthy
morass
,
in
which
he
had
sunk
of
his
*NL*
own
free
will
,
was
too
revolting
to
him
,
and
,
like
very
many
men
in
such
*NL*
cases
,
he
put
faith
above
all
in
change
of
place
.
If
only
it
were
not
for
*NL*
these
people
,
if
only
it
were
not
for
these
circumstances
,
if
only
he
*NL*
could
fly
away
from
this
accursed
place
--
he
would
be
altogether
*NL*
regenerated
,
would
enter
on
a
new
path
.
That
was
what
he
believed
in
,
and
*NL*
what
he
was
yearning
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
could
only
be
on
condition
of
the
first
,
the
_
happy
_
solution
*NL*
of
the
question
.
There
was
another
possibility
,
a
different
and
awful
*NL*
ending
.
Suddenly
she
might
say
to
him
:
``
Go
away
.
I
have
just
come
to
terms
*NL*
with
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
I
am
going
to
marry
him
and
do
n't
want
you
''
--
and
*NL*
then
...
but
then
...
But
Mitya
did
not
know
what
would
happen
then
.
Up
to
*NL*
the
last
hour
he
did
n't
know
.
That
must
be
said
to
his
credit
.
He
had
no
*NL*
definite
intentions
,
had
planned
no
crime
.
He
was
simply
watching
and
*NL*
spying
in
agony
,
while
he
prepared
himself
for
the
first
,
happy
solution
*NL*
of
his
destiny
.
He
drove
away
any
other
idea
,
in
fact
.
But
for
that
ending
*NL*
a
quite
different
anxiety
arose
,
a
new
,
incidental
,
but
yet
fatal
and
*NL*
insoluble
difficulty
presented
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
were
to
say
to
him
:
``
I
'm
yours
;
take
me
away
,
''
how
could
he
take
*NL*
her
away
?
Where
had
he
the
means
,
the
money
to
do
it
?
It
was
just
at
this
*NL*
time
that
all
sources
of
revenue
from
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
doles
which
had
*NL*
gone
on
without
interruption
for
so
many
years
,
ceased
.
Grushenka
had
*NL*
money
,
of
course
,
but
with
regard
to
this
Mitya
suddenly
evinced
*NL*
extraordinary
pride
;
he
wanted
to
carry
her
away
and
begin
the
new
life
*NL*
with
her
himself
,
at
his
own
expense
,
not
at
hers
.
He
could
not
conceive
*NL*
of
taking
her
money
,
and
the
very
idea
caused
him
a
pang
of
intense
*NL*
repulsion
.
I
wo
n't
enlarge
on
this
fact
or
analyze
it
here
,
but
confine
*NL*
myself
to
remarking
that
this
was
his
attitude
at
the
moment
.
All
this
may
*NL*
have
arisen
indirectly
and
unconsciously
from
the
secret
stings
of
his
*NL*
conscience
for
the
money
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
that
he
had
dishonestly
*NL*
appropriated
.
``
I
've
been
a
scoundrel
to
one
of
them
,
and
I
shall
be
a
*NL*
scoundrel
again
to
the
other
directly
,
''
was
his
feeling
then
,
as
he
*NL*
explained
after
:
``
and
when
Grushenka
knows
,
she
wo
n't
care
for
such
a
*NL*
scoundrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Where
then
was
he
to
get
the
means
,
where
was
he
to
get
the
fateful
money
?
*NL*
Without
it
,
all
would
be
lost
and
nothing
could
be
done
,
``
and
only
because
*NL*
I
had
n't
the
money
.
Oh
,
the
shame
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
anticipate
things
:
he
did
,
perhaps
,
know
where
to
get
the
money
,
knew
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
where
it
lay
at
that
moment
.
I
will
say
no
more
of
this
here
,
as
*NL*
it
will
all
be
clear
later
.
But
his
chief
trouble
,
I
must
explain
however
*NL*
obscurely
,
lay
in
the
fact
that
to
have
that
sum
he
knew
of
,
to
_
have
the
*NL*
right
_
to
take
it
,
he
must
first
restore
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
three
*NL*
thousand
--
if
not
,
``
I
'm
a
common
pickpocket
,
I
'm
a
scoundrel
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
begin
a
new
life
as
a
scoundrel
,
''
Mitya
decided
.
And
so
he
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
return
Katerina
Ivanovna
that
three
*NL*
thousand
,
and
that
_
first
of
all
_
.
The
final
stage
of
this
decision
,
so
to
*NL*
say
,
had
been
reached
only
during
the
last
hours
,
that
is
,
after
his
last
*NL*
interview
with
Alyosha
,
two
days
before
,
on
the
high-road
,
on
the
evening
*NL*
when
Grushenka
had
insulted
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
Mitya
,
after
hearing
*NL*
Alyosha
's
account
of
it
,
had
admitted
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
,
and
told
*NL*
him
to
tell
Katerina
Ivanovna
so
,
if
it
could
be
any
comfort
to
her
.
After
*NL*
parting
from
his
brother
on
that
night
,
he
had
felt
in
his
frenzy
that
it
*NL*
would
be
better
``
to
murder
and
rob
some
one
than
fail
to
pay
my
debt
to
*NL*
Katya
.
I
'd
rather
every
one
thought
me
a
robber
and
a
murderer
,
I
'd
rather
*NL*
go
to
Siberia
than
that
Katya
should
have
the
right
to
say
that
I
deceived
*NL*
her
and
stole
her
money
,
and
used
her
money
to
run
away
with
Grushenka
and
*NL*
begin
a
new
life
!
That
I
ca
n't
do
!
''
So
Mitya
decided
,
grinding
his
teeth
,
*NL*
and
he
might
well
fancy
at
times
that
his
brain
would
give
way
.
But
*NL*
meanwhile
he
went
on
struggling
...
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
though
one
would
have
supposed
there
was
nothing
left
for
*NL*
him
but
despair
--
for
what
chance
had
he
,
with
nothing
in
the
world
,
to
*NL*
raise
such
a
sum
?
--
yet
to
the
very
end
he
persisted
in
hoping
that
he
would
*NL*
get
that
three
thousand
,
that
the
money
would
somehow
come
to
him
of
*NL*
itself
,
as
though
it
might
drop
from
heaven
.
That
is
just
how
it
is
with
*NL*
people
who
,
like
Dmitri
,
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
money
,
except
*NL*
to
squander
what
has
come
to
them
by
inheritance
without
any
effort
of
*NL*
their
own
,
and
have
no
notion
how
money
is
obtained
.
A
whirl
of
the
most
*NL*
fantastic
notions
took
possession
of
his
brain
immediately
after
he
had
*NL*
parted
with
Alyosha
two
days
before
,
and
threw
his
thoughts
into
a
tangle
*NL*
of
confusion
.
This
is
how
it
was
he
pitched
first
on
a
perfectly
wild
*NL*
enterprise
.
And
perhaps
to
men
of
that
kind
in
such
circumstances
the
most
*NL*
impossible
,
fantastic
schemes
occur
first
,
and
seem
most
practical
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
determined
to
go
to
Samsonov
,
the
merchant
who
was
Grushenka
's
*NL*
protector
,
and
to
propose
a
``
scheme
''
to
him
,
and
by
means
of
it
to
obtain
*NL*
from
him
at
once
the
whole
of
the
sum
required
.
Of
the
commercial
value
of
*NL*
his
scheme
he
had
no
doubt
,
not
the
slightest
,
and
was
only
uncertain
how
*NL*
Samsonov
would
look
upon
his
freak
,
supposing
he
were
to
consider
it
from
*NL*
any
but
the
commercial
point
of
view
.
Though
Mitya
knew
the
merchant
by
*NL*
sight
,
he
was
not
acquainted
with
him
and
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
him
.
*NL*
But
for
some
unknown
reason
he
had
long
entertained
the
conviction
that
*NL*
the
old
reprobate
,
who
was
lying
at
death
's
door
,
would
perhaps
not
at
all
*NL*
object
now
to
Grushenka
's
securing
a
respectable
position
,
and
marrying
a
*NL*
man
``
to
be
depended
upon
.
''
And
he
believed
not
only
that
he
would
not
*NL*
object
,
but
that
this
was
what
he
desired
,
and
,
if
opportunity
arose
,
that
*NL*
he
would
be
ready
to
help
.
From
some
rumor
,
or
perhaps
from
some
stray
*NL*
word
of
Grushenka
's
,
he
had
gathered
further
that
the
old
man
would
*NL*
perhaps
prefer
him
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
for
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possibly
many
of
the
readers
of
my
novel
will
feel
that
in
reckoning
on
*NL*
such
assistance
,
and
being
ready
to
take
his
bride
,
so
to
speak
,
from
the
*NL*
hands
of
her
protector
,
Dmitri
showed
great
coarseness
and
want
of
*NL*
delicacy
.
I
will
only
observe
that
Mitya
looked
upon
Grushenka
's
past
as
*NL*
something
completely
over
.
He
looked
on
that
past
with
infinite
pity
and
*NL*
resolved
with
all
the
fervor
of
his
passion
that
when
once
Grushenka
told
*NL*
him
she
loved
him
and
would
marry
him
,
it
would
mean
the
beginning
of
a
*NL*
new
Grushenka
and
a
new
Dmitri
,
free
from
every
vice
.
They
would
forgive
*NL*
one
another
and
would
begin
their
lives
afresh
.
As
for
Kuzma
Samsonov
,
*NL*
Dmitri
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
who
had
exercised
a
fateful
influence
in
*NL*
that
remote
past
of
Grushenka
's
,
though
she
had
never
loved
him
,
and
who
*NL*
was
now
himself
a
thing
of
the
past
,
completely
done
with
,
and
,
so
to
say
,
*NL*
non-existent
.
Besides
,
Mitya
hardly
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
at
all
,
for
*NL*
it
was
known
to
every
one
in
the
town
that
he
was
only
a
shattered
wreck
,
*NL*
whose
relations
with
Grushenka
had
changed
their
character
and
were
now
*NL*
simply
paternal
,
and
that
this
had
been
so
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
case
there
was
much
simplicity
on
Mitya
's
part
in
all
this
,
for
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
his
vices
,
he
was
a
very
simple-hearted
man
.
It
was
an
*NL*
instance
of
this
simplicity
that
Mitya
was
seriously
persuaded
that
,
being
*NL*
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
the
next
world
,
old
Kuzma
must
sincerely
*NL*
repent
of
his
past
relations
with
Grushenka
,
and
that
she
had
no
more
*NL*
devoted
friend
and
protector
in
the
world
than
this
,
now
harmless
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
conversation
with
Alyosha
,
at
the
cross-roads
,
he
hardly
slept
*NL*
all
night
,
and
at
ten
o'clock
next
morning
,
he
was
at
the
house
of
*NL*
Samsonov
and
telling
the
servant
to
announce
him
.
It
was
a
very
large
and
*NL*
gloomy
old
house
of
two
stories
,
with
a
lodge
and
outhouses
.
In
the
lower
*NL*
story
lived
Samsonov
's
two
married
sons
with
their
families
,
his
old
*NL*
sister
,
and
his
unmarried
daughter
.
In
the
lodge
lived
two
of
his
clerks
,
*NL*
one
of
whom
also
had
a
large
family
.
Both
the
lodge
and
the
lower
story
*NL*
were
overcrowded
,
but
the
old
man
kept
the
upper
floor
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
would
not
even
let
the
daughter
live
there
with
him
,
though
she
waited
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
in
spite
of
her
asthma
was
obliged
at
certain
fixed
hours
,
*NL*
and
at
any
time
he
might
call
her
,
to
run
upstairs
to
him
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
upper
floor
contained
a
number
of
large
rooms
kept
purely
for
show
,
*NL*
furnished
in
the
old-fashioned
merchant
style
,
with
long
monotonous
rows
*NL*
of
clumsy
mahogany
chairs
along
the
walls
,
with
glass
chandeliers
under
*NL*
shades
,
and
gloomy
mirrors
on
the
walls
.
All
these
rooms
were
entirely
*NL*
empty
and
unused
,
for
the
old
man
kept
to
one
room
,
a
small
,
remote
*NL*
bedroom
,
where
he
was
waited
upon
by
an
old
servant
with
a
kerchief
on
her
*NL*
head
,
and
by
a
lad
,
who
used
to
sit
on
the
locker
in
the
passage
.
Owing
to
*NL*
his
swollen
legs
,
the
old
man
could
hardly
walk
at
all
,
and
was
only
*NL*
rarely
lifted
from
his
leather
arm-chair
,
when
the
old
woman
supporting
*NL*
him
led
him
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
.
He
was
morose
and
taciturn
*NL*
even
with
this
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
informed
of
the
arrival
of
the
``
captain
,
''
he
at
once
refused
*NL*
to
see
him
.
But
Mitya
persisted
and
sent
his
name
up
again
.
Samsonov
*NL*
questioned
the
lad
minutely
:
What
he
looked
like
?
Whether
he
was
drunk
?
*NL*
Was
he
going
to
make
a
row
?
The
answer
he
received
was
:
that
he
was
sober
,
*NL*
but
would
n't
go
away
.
The
old
man
again
refused
to
see
him
.
Then
Mitya
,
*NL*
who
had
foreseen
this
,
and
purposely
brought
pencil
and
paper
with
him
,
*NL*
wrote
clearly
on
the
piece
of
paper
the
words
:
``
On
most
important
business
*NL*
closely
concerning
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
''
and
sent
it
up
to
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
thinking
a
little
Samsonov
told
the
lad
to
take
the
visitor
to
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
sent
the
old
woman
downstairs
with
a
summons
to
his
*NL*
younger
son
to
come
upstairs
to
him
at
once
.
This
younger
son
,
a
man
over
*NL*
six
foot
and
of
exceptional
physical
strength
,
who
was
closely-shaven
and
*NL*
dressed
in
the
European
style
,
though
his
father
still
wore
a
kaftan
and
a
*NL*
beard
,
came
at
once
without
a
comment
.
All
the
family
trembled
before
the
*NL*
father
.
The
old
man
had
sent
for
this
giant
,
not
because
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
the
``
captain
''
-LRB-
he
was
by
no
means
of
a
timorous
temper
-RRB-
,
but
in
order
to
*NL*
have
a
witness
in
case
of
any
emergency
.
Supported
by
his
son
and
the
*NL*
servant-lad
,
he
waddled
at
last
into
the
drawing-room
.
It
may
be
assumed
*NL*
that
he
felt
considerable
curiosity
.
The
drawing-room
in
which
Mitya
was
*NL*
awaiting
him
was
a
vast
,
dreary
room
that
laid
a
weight
of
depression
on
*NL*
the
heart
.
It
had
a
double
row
of
windows
,
a
gallery
,
marbled
walls
,
and
*NL*
three
immense
chandeliers
with
glass
lusters
covered
with
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
sitting
on
a
little
chair
at
the
entrance
,
awaiting
his
fate
*NL*
with
nervous
impatience
.
When
the
old
man
appeared
at
the
opposite
door
,
*NL*
seventy
feet
away
,
Mitya
jumped
up
at
once
,
and
with
his
long
,
military
*NL*
stride
walked
to
meet
him
.
Mitya
was
well
dressed
,
in
a
frock-coat
,
*NL*
buttoned
up
,
with
a
round
hat
and
black
gloves
in
his
hands
,
just
as
he
*NL*
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
elder
's
,
at
the
family
meeting
with
his
*NL*
father
and
brothers
.
The
old
man
waited
for
him
,
standing
dignified
and
*NL*
unbending
,
and
Mitya
felt
at
once
that
he
had
looked
him
through
and
*NL*
through
as
he
advanced
.
Mitya
was
greatly
impressed
,
too
,
with
Samsonov
's
*NL*
immensely
swollen
face
.
His
lower
lip
,
which
had
always
been
thick
,
hung
*NL*
down
now
,
looking
like
a
bun
.
He
bowed
to
his
guest
in
dignified
silence
,
*NL*
motioned
him
to
a
low
chair
by
the
sofa
,
and
,
leaning
on
his
son
's
arm
he
*NL*
began
lowering
himself
on
to
the
sofa
opposite
,
groaning
painfully
,
so
*NL*
that
Mitya
,
seeing
his
painful
exertions
,
immediately
felt
remorseful
and
*NL*
sensitively
conscious
of
his
insignificance
in
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
dignified
person
he
had
ventured
to
disturb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
want
of
me
,
sir
?
''
said
the
old
man
,
deliberately
,
*NL*
distinctly
,
severely
,
but
courteously
,
when
he
was
at
last
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
started
,
leapt
up
,
but
sat
down
again
.
Then
he
began
at
once
*NL*
speaking
with
loud
,
nervous
haste
,
gesticulating
,
and
in
a
positive
*NL*
frenzy
.
He
was
unmistakably
a
man
driven
into
a
corner
,
on
the
brink
of
*NL*
ruin
,
catching
at
the
last
straw
,
ready
to
sink
if
he
failed
.
Old
Samsonov
*NL*
probably
grasped
all
this
in
an
instant
,
though
his
face
remained
cold
and
*NL*
immovable
as
a
statue
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
honored
sir
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
you
have
no
doubt
heard
more
than
once
*NL*
of
my
disputes
with
my
father
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
Karamazov
,
who
robbed
me
*NL*
of
my
inheritance
from
my
mother
...
seeing
the
whole
town
is
gossiping
*NL*
about
it
...
for
here
every
one
's
gossiping
of
what
they
should
n't
...
and
*NL*
besides
,
it
might
have
reached
you
through
Grushenka
...
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
,
through
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
...
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
the
lady
*NL*
for
whom
I
have
the
highest
respect
and
esteem
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mitya
began
,
and
broke
down
at
the
first
sentence
.
We
will
not
*NL*
reproduce
his
speech
word
for
word
,
but
will
only
summarize
the
gist
of
*NL*
it
.
Three
months
ago
,
he
said
,
he
had
of
express
intention
-LRB-
Mitya
*NL*
purposely
used
these
words
instead
of
``
intentionally
''
-RRB-
consulted
a
lawyer
*NL*
in
the
chief
town
of
the
province
,
``
a
distinguished
lawyer
,
Kuzma
*NL*
Kuzmitch
,
Pavel
Pavlovitch
Korneplodov
.
You
have
perhaps
heard
of
him
?
A
*NL*
man
of
vast
intellect
,
the
mind
of
a
statesman
...
he
knows
you
,
too
...
*NL*
spoke
of
you
in
the
highest
terms
...
''
Mitya
broke
down
again
.
But
these
*NL*
breaks
did
not
deter
him
.
He
leapt
instantly
over
the
gaps
,
and
struggled
*NL*
on
and
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Korneplodov
,
after
questioning
him
minutely
,
and
inspecting
the
*NL*
documents
he
was
able
to
bring
him
-LRB-
Mitya
alluded
somewhat
vaguely
to
*NL*
these
documents
,
and
slurred
over
the
subject
with
special
haste
-RRB-
,
*NL*
reported
that
they
certainly
might
take
proceedings
concerning
the
village
*NL*
of
Tchermashnya
,
which
ought
,
he
said
,
to
have
come
to
him
,
Mitya
,
from
*NL*
his
mother
,
and
so
checkmate
the
old
villain
,
his
father
...
``
because
*NL*
every
door
was
not
closed
and
justice
might
still
find
a
loophole
.
''
In
*NL*
fact
,
he
might
reckon
on
an
additional
sum
of
six
or
even
seven
thousand
*NL*
roubles
from
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
as
Tchermashnya
was
worth
,
at
least
,
*NL*
twenty-five
thousand
,
he
might
say
twenty-eight
thousand
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
``
thirty
,
thirty
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
and
would
you
believe
it
,
I
did
n't
get
*NL*
seventeen
from
that
heartless
man
!
''
So
he
,
Mitya
,
had
thrown
the
business
*NL*
up
,
for
the
time
,
knowing
nothing
about
the
law
,
but
on
coming
here
was
*NL*
struck
dumb
by
a
cross-claim
made
upon
him
-LRB-
here
Mitya
went
adrift
again
*NL*
and
again
took
a
flying
leap
forward
-RRB-
,
``
so
will
not
you
,
excellent
and
*NL*
honored
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
be
willing
to
take
up
all
my
claims
against
that
*NL*
unnatural
monster
,
and
pay
me
a
sum
down
of
only
three
thousand
?
...
You
*NL*
see
,
you
can
not
,
in
any
case
,
lose
over
it
.
On
my
honor
,
my
honor
,
I
swear
*NL*
that
.
Quite
the
contrary
,
you
may
make
six
or
seven
thousand
instead
of
*NL*
three
.
''
Above
all
,
he
wanted
this
concluded
that
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
the
business
with
you
at
a
notary
's
,
or
whatever
it
is
...
in
*NL*
fact
,
I
'm
ready
to
do
anything
...
I
'll
hand
over
all
the
deeds
...
*NL*
whatever
you
want
,
sign
anything
...
and
we
could
draw
up
the
agreement
at
*NL*
once
...
and
if
it
were
possible
,
if
it
were
only
possible
,
that
very
*NL*
morning
...
You
could
pay
me
that
three
thousand
,
for
there
is
n't
a
*NL*
capitalist
in
this
town
to
compare
with
you
,
and
so
would
save
me
from
...
*NL*
would
save
me
,
in
fact
...
for
a
good
,
I
might
say
an
honorable
action
...
*NL*
For
I
cherish
the
most
honorable
feelings
for
a
certain
person
,
whom
you
*NL*
know
well
,
and
care
for
as
a
father
.
I
would
not
have
come
,
indeed
,
if
it
*NL*
had
not
been
as
a
father
.
And
,
indeed
,
it
's
a
struggle
of
three
in
this
*NL*
business
,
for
it
's
fate
--
that
's
a
fearful
thing
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
!
A
tragedy
,
*NL*
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
a
tragedy
!
And
as
you
've
dropped
out
long
ago
,
it
's
a
tug
-
*NL*
of-war
between
two
.
I
'm
expressing
it
awkwardly
,
perhaps
,
but
I
'm
not
a
*NL*
literary
man
.
You
see
,
I
'm
on
the
one
side
,
and
that
monster
on
the
other
.
*NL*
So
you
must
choose
.
It
's
either
I
or
the
monster
.
It
all
lies
in
your
*NL*
hands
--
the
fate
of
three
lives
,
and
the
happiness
of
two
...
Excuse
me
,
I
'm
*NL*
making
a
mess
of
it
,
but
you
understand
...
I
see
from
your
venerable
eyes
*NL*
that
you
understand
...
and
if
you
do
n't
understand
,
I
'm
done
for
...
so
*NL*
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
broke
off
his
clumsy
speech
with
that
,
``
so
you
see
!
''
and
jumping
up
*NL*
from
his
seat
,
awaited
the
answer
to
his
foolish
proposal
.
At
the
last
*NL*
phrase
he
had
suddenly
become
hopelessly
aware
that
it
had
all
fallen
*NL*
flat
,
above
all
,
that
he
had
been
talking
utter
nonsense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
it
is
!
On
the
way
here
it
seemed
all
right
,
and
now
it
's
*NL*
nothing
but
nonsense
.
''
The
idea
suddenly
dawned
on
his
despairing
mind
.
*NL*
All
the
while
he
had
been
talking
,
the
old
man
sat
motionless
,
watching
*NL*
him
with
an
icy
expression
in
his
eyes
.
After
keeping
him
for
a
moment
in
*NL*
suspense
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
pronounced
at
last
in
the
most
positive
and
*NL*
chilling
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
we
do
n't
undertake
such
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
suddenly
felt
his
legs
growing
weak
under
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
now
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
?
''
he
muttered
,
with
a
pale
smile
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
it
's
all
up
with
me
--
what
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
remained
standing
,
staring
motionless
.
He
suddenly
noticed
a
*NL*
movement
in
the
old
man
's
face
.
He
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
sir
,
business
of
that
sort
's
not
in
our
line
,
''
said
the
old
man
*NL*
slowly
.
``
There
's
the
court
,
and
the
lawyers
--
it
's
a
perfect
misery
.
But
if
*NL*
you
like
,
there
is
a
man
here
you
might
apply
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
Who
is
it
?
You
're
my
salvation
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
''
faltered
*NL*
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
live
here
,
and
he
's
not
here
just
now
.
He
is
a
peasant
,
he
*NL*
does
business
in
timber
.
His
name
is
Lyagavy
.
He
's
been
haggling
with
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
for
the
last
year
,
over
your
copse
at
Tchermashnya
.
They
*NL*
ca
n't
agree
on
the
price
,
maybe
you
've
heard
?
Now
he
's
come
back
again
and
*NL*
is
staying
with
the
priest
at
Ilyinskoe
,
about
twelve
versts
from
the
*NL*
Volovya
station
.
He
wrote
to
me
,
too
,
about
the
business
of
the
copse
,
*NL*
asking
my
advice
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
means
to
go
and
see
him
himself
.
So
if
*NL*
you
were
to
be
beforehand
with
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
to
make
Lyagavy
the
*NL*
offer
you
've
made
me
,
he
might
possibly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brilliant
idea
!
''
Mitya
interrupted
ecstatically
.
``
He
's
the
very
man
,
it
*NL*
would
just
suit
him
.
He
's
haggling
with
him
for
it
,
being
asked
too
much
,
*NL*
and
here
he
would
have
all
the
documents
entitling
him
to
the
property
*NL*
itself
.
Ha
ha
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mitya
suddenly
went
off
into
his
short
,
wooden
laugh
,
startling
*NL*
Samsonov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
thank
you
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
?
''
cried
Mitya
effusively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mention
it
,
''
said
Samsonov
,
inclining
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
know
,
you
've
saved
me

Oh
,
it
was
a
true
presentiment

brought
me
to
you

So
now
to
this
priest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
need
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
make
haste
and
fly
there
.
I
'm
afraid
I
've
overtaxed
your
strength

I
*NL*
shall
never
forget
it
.
It
's
a
Russian
says
that
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
a
R-r
-
*NL*
russian
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
seized
his
hand
to
press
it
,
but
there
was
a
malignant
gleam
in
the
*NL*
old
man
's
eye
.
Mitya
drew
back
his
hand
,
but
at
once
blamed
himself
for
*NL*
his
mistrustfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
he
's
tired
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
her
sake
!
For
her
sake
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
!
You
understand
that
it
's
for
*NL*
her
,
''
he
cried
,
his
voice
ringing
through
the
room
.
He
bowed
,
turned
*NL*
sharply
round
,
and
with
the
same
long
stride
walked
to
the
door
without
*NL*
looking
back
.
He
was
trembling
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
was
on
the
verge
of
ruin
and
my
guardian
angel
saved
me
,
''
was
*NL*
the
thought
in
his
mind
.
And
if
such
a
business
man
as
Samsonov
-LRB-
a
most
*NL*
worthy
old
man
,
and
what
dignity
!
-RRB-
had
suggested
this
course
,
then
...
*NL*
then
success
was
assured
.
He
would
fly
off
immediately
.
``
I
will
be
back
*NL*
before
night
,
I
shall
be
back
at
night
and
the
thing
is
done
.
Could
the
*NL*
old
man
have
been
laughing
at
me
?
''
exclaimed
Mitya
,
as
he
strode
towards
*NL*
his
lodging
.
He
could
,
of
course
,
imagine
nothing
,
but
that
the
advice
was
*NL*
practical
``
from
such
a
business
man
''
with
an
understanding
of
the
*NL*
business
,
with
an
understanding
of
this
Lyagavy
-LRB-
curious
surname
!
-RRB-
.
Or
--
the
*NL*
old
man
was
laughing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
The
second
alternative
was
the
correct
one
.
Long
afterwards
,
when
*NL*
the
catastrophe
had
happened
,
old
Samsonov
himself
confessed
,
laughing
,
*NL*
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
the
``
captain
.
''
He
was
a
cold
,
spiteful
and
*NL*
sarcastic
man
,
liable
to
violent
antipathies
.
Whether
it
was
the
*NL*
``
captain
's
''
excited
face
,
or
the
foolish
conviction
of
the
``
rake
and
*NL*
spendthrift
,
''
that
he
,
Samsonov
,
could
be
taken
in
by
such
a
cock-and-bull
*NL*
story
as
his
scheme
,
or
his
jealousy
of
Grushenka
,
in
whose
name
this
*NL*
``
scapegrace
''
had
rushed
in
on
him
with
such
a
tale
to
get
money
which
*NL*
worked
on
the
old
man
,
I
ca
n't
tell
.
But
at
the
instant
when
Mitya
stood
*NL*
before
him
,
feeling
his
legs
grow
weak
under
him
,
and
frantically
*NL*
exclaiming
that
he
was
ruined
,
at
that
moment
the
old
man
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
intense
spite
,
and
resolved
to
make
a
laughing-stock
of
him
.
When
*NL*
Mitya
had
gone
,
Kuzma
Kuzmitch
,
white
with
rage
,
turned
to
his
son
and
*NL*
bade
him
see
to
it
that
that
beggar
be
never
seen
again
,
and
never
*NL*
admitted
even
into
the
yard
,
or
else
he
'd
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
utter
his
threat
.
But
even
his
son
,
who
often
saw
him
enraged
,
*NL*
trembled
with
fear
.
For
a
whole
hour
afterwards
,
the
old
man
was
shaking
*NL*
with
anger
,
and
by
evening
he
was
worse
,
and
sent
for
the
doctor

*NL*
So
he
must
drive
at
full
speed
,
and
he
had
not
the
money
for
horses
.
He
*NL*
had
forty
kopecks
,
and
that
was
all
,
all
that
was
left
after
so
many
years
*NL*
of
prosperity
!
But
he
had
at
home
an
old
silver
watch
which
had
long
*NL*
ceased
to
go
.
He
snatched
it
up
and
carried
it
to
a
Jewish
watchmaker
who
*NL*
had
a
shop
in
the
market-place
.
The
Jew
gave
him
six
roubles
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
did
n't
expect
that
,
''
cried
Mitya
,
ecstatically
.
-LRB-
He
was
still
in
a
*NL*
state
of
ecstasy
.
-RRB-
He
seized
his
six
roubles
and
ran
home
.
At
home
he
*NL*
borrowed
three
roubles
from
the
people
of
the
house
,
who
loved
him
so
much
*NL*
that
they
were
pleased
to
give
it
him
,
though
it
was
all
they
had
.
Mitya
*NL*
in
his
excitement
told
them
on
the
spot
that
his
fate
would
be
decided
*NL*
that
day
,
and
he
described
,
in
desperate
haste
,
the
whole
scheme
he
had
*NL*
put
before
Samsonov
,
the
latter
's
decision
,
his
own
hopes
for
the
future
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
These
people
had
been
told
many
of
their
lodger
's
secrets
*NL*
before
,
and
so
looked
upon
him
as
a
gentleman
who
was
not
at
all
proud
,
*NL*
and
almost
one
of
themselves
.
Having
thus
collected
nine
roubles
Mitya
*NL*
sent
for
posting-horses
to
take
him
to
the
Volovya
station
.
This
was
how
*NL*
the
fact
came
to
be
remembered
and
established
that
``
at
midday
,
on
the
day
*NL*
before
the
event
,
Mitya
had
not
a
farthing
,
and
that
he
had
sold
his
watch
*NL*
to
get
money
and
had
borrowed
three
roubles
from
his
landlord
,
all
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
witnesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
note
this
fact
,
later
on
it
will
be
apparent
why
I
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
radiant
with
the
joyful
anticipation
that
he
would
at
last
*NL*
solve
all
his
difficulties
,
yet
,
as
he
drew
near
Volovya
station
,
he
*NL*
trembled
at
the
thought
of
what
Grushenka
might
be
doing
in
his
absence
.
*NL*
What
if
she
made
up
her
mind
to-day
to
go
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
?
This
was
*NL*
why
he
had
gone
off
without
telling
her
and
why
he
left
orders
with
his
*NL*
landlady
not
to
let
out
where
he
had
gone
,
if
any
one
came
to
inquire
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
,
I
must
get
back
to-night
,
''
he
repeated
,
as
he
was
jolted
along
in
*NL*
the
cart
,
``
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
have
to
bring
this
Lyagavy
back
here
...
*NL*
to
draw
up
the
deed
.
''
So
mused
Mitya
,
with
a
throbbing
heart
,
but
alas
!
*NL*
his
dreams
were
not
fated
to
be
carried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
begin
with
,
he
was
late
,
taking
a
short
cut
from
Volovya
station
which
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
eighteen
versts
instead
of
twelve
.
Secondly
,
he
did
not
*NL*
find
the
priest
at
home
at
Ilyinskoe
;
he
had
gone
off
to
a
neighboring
*NL*
village
.
While
Mitya
,
setting
off
there
with
the
same
exhausted
horses
,
*NL*
was
looking
for
him
,
it
was
almost
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
,
a
shy
and
amiable
looking
little
man
,
informed
him
at
once
*NL*
that
though
Lyagavy
had
been
staying
with
him
at
first
,
he
was
now
at
*NL*
Suhoy
Possyolok
,
that
he
was
staying
the
night
in
the
forester
's
cottage
,
*NL*
as
he
was
buying
timber
there
too
.
At
Mitya
's
urgent
request
that
he
would
*NL*
take
him
to
Lyagavy
at
once
,
and
by
so
doing
``
save
him
,
so
to
speak
,
''
the
*NL*
priest
agreed
,
after
some
demur
,
to
conduct
him
to
Suhoy
Possyolok
;
his
*NL*
curiosity
was
obviously
aroused
.
But
,
unluckily
,
he
advised
their
going
on
*NL*
foot
,
as
it
would
not
be
``
much
over
''
a
verst
.
Mitya
,
of
course
,
agreed
,
*NL*
and
marched
off
with
his
yard-long
strides
,
so
that
the
poor
priest
almost
*NL*
ran
after
him
.
He
was
a
very
cautious
man
,
though
not
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
at
once
began
talking
to
him
,
too
,
of
his
plans
,
nervously
and
*NL*
excitedly
asking
advice
in
regard
to
Lyagavy
,
and
talking
all
the
way
.
The
*NL*
priest
listened
attentively
,
but
gave
little
advice
.
He
turned
off
Mitya
's
*NL*
questions
with
:
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Ah
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
How
can
I
tell
?
''
and
so
*NL*
on
.
When
Mitya
began
to
speak
of
his
quarrel
with
his
father
over
his
*NL*
inheritance
,
the
priest
was
positively
alarmed
,
as
he
was
in
some
way
*NL*
dependent
on
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
He
inquired
,
however
,
with
surprise
,
why
*NL*
he
called
the
peasant-trader
Gorstkin
,
Lyagavy
,
and
obligingly
explained
*NL*
to
Mitya
that
,
though
the
man
's
name
really
was
Lyagavy
,
he
was
never
*NL*
called
so
,
as
he
would
be
grievously
offended
at
the
name
,
and
that
he
*NL*
must
be
sure
to
call
him
Gorstkin
,
``
or
you
'll
do
nothing
with
him
;
he
*NL*
wo
n't
even
listen
to
you
,
''
said
the
priest
in
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
somewhat
surprised
for
a
moment
,
and
explained
that
that
was
*NL*
what
Samsonov
had
called
him
.
On
hearing
this
fact
,
the
priest
dropped
the
*NL*
subject
,
though
he
would
have
done
well
to
put
into
words
his
doubt
*NL*
whether
,
if
Samsonov
had
sent
him
to
that
peasant
,
calling
him
Lyagavy
,
*NL*
there
was
not
something
wrong
about
it
and
he
was
turning
him
into
*NL*
ridicule
.
But
Mitya
had
no
time
to
pause
over
such
trifles
.
He
hurried
,
*NL*
striding
along
,
and
only
when
he
reached
Suhoy
Possyolok
did
he
realize
*NL*
that
they
had
come
not
one
verst
,
nor
one
and
a
half
,
but
at
least
three
.
*NL*
This
annoyed
him
,
but
he
controlled
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
hut
.
The
forester
lived
in
one
half
of
the
hut
,
and
*NL*
Gorstkin
was
lodging
in
the
other
,
the
better
room
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
passage
.
They
went
into
that
room
and
lighted
a
tallow
candle
.
The
hut
was
*NL*
extremely
overheated
.
On
the
table
there
was
a
samovar
that
had
gone
out
,
*NL*
a
tray
with
cups
,
an
empty
rum
bottle
,
a
bottle
of
vodka
partly
full
,
and
*NL*
some
half-eaten
crusts
of
wheaten
bread
.
The
visitor
himself
lay
stretched
*NL*
at
full
length
on
the
bench
,
with
his
coat
crushed
up
under
his
head
for
a
*NL*
pillow
,
snoring
heavily
.
Mitya
stood
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
must
wake
him
.
My
business
is
too
important
.
I
've
come
in
*NL*
such
haste
.
I
'm
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to-day
,
''
he
said
in
great
*NL*
agitation
.
But
the
priest
and
the
forester
stood
in
silence
,
not
giving
*NL*
their
opinion
.
Mitya
went
up
and
began
trying
to
wake
him
himself
;
he
*NL*
tried
vigorously
,
but
the
sleeper
did
not
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
drunk
,
''
Mitya
decided
.
``
Good
Lord
!
What
am
I
to
do
?
What
am
I
to
*NL*
do
?
''
And
,
terribly
impatient
,
he
began
pulling
him
by
the
arms
,
by
the
*NL*
legs
,
shaking
his
head
,
lifting
him
up
and
making
him
sit
on
the
bench
.
*NL*
Yet
,
after
prolonged
exertions
,
he
could
only
succeed
in
getting
the
*NL*
drunken
man
to
utter
absurd
grunts
,
and
violent
,
but
inarticulate
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
'd
better
wait
a
little
,
''
the
priest
pronounced
at
last
,
``
for
he
's
*NL*
obviously
not
in
a
fit
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
drinking
the
whole
day
,
''
the
forester
chimed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
If
only
you
knew
how
important
it
is
to
me
*NL*
and
how
desperate
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
'd
better
wait
till
morning
,
''
the
priest
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
morning
?
Mercy
!
that
's
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
his
despair
he
was
on
the
point
of
attacking
the
sleeping
man
*NL*
again
,
but
stopped
short
at
once
,
realizing
the
uselessness
of
his
*NL*
efforts
.
The
priest
said
nothing
,
the
sleepy
forester
looked
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
terrible
tragedies
real
life
contrives
for
people
,
''
said
Mitya
,
in
*NL*
complete
despair
.
The
perspiration
was
streaming
down
his
face
.
The
priest
*NL*
seized
the
moment
to
put
before
him
,
very
reasonably
,
that
,
even
if
he
*NL*
succeeded
in
wakening
the
man
,
he
would
still
be
drunk
and
incapable
of
*NL*
conversation
.
``
And
your
business
is
important
,
''
he
said
,
``
so
you
'd
*NL*
certainly
better
put
it
off
till
morning
.
''
With
a
gesture
of
despair
Mitya
*NL*
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
will
stay
here
with
a
light
,
and
seize
the
favorable
moment
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
wakes
I
'll
begin
.
I
'll
pay
you
for
the
light
,
''
he
said
to
the
*NL*
forester
,
``
for
the
night
's
lodging
,
too
;
you
'll
remember
Dmitri
Karamazov
.
*NL*
Only
,
Father
,
I
do
n't
know
what
we
're
to
do
with
you
.
Where
will
you
*NL*
sleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
going
home
.
I
'll
take
his
horse
and
get
home
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
indicating
the
forester
.
``
And
now
I
'll
say
good-by
.
I
wish
you
all
*NL*
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
settled
.
The
priest
rode
off
on
the
forester
's
horse
,
delighted
*NL*
to
escape
,
though
he
shook
his
head
uneasily
,
wondering
whether
he
ought
*NL*
not
next
day
to
inform
his
benefactor
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
of
this
curious
*NL*
incident
,
``
or
he
may
in
an
unlucky
hour
hear
of
it
,
be
angry
,
and
withdraw
*NL*
his
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
forester
,
scratching
himself
,
went
back
to
his
room
without
a
word
,
*NL*
and
Mitya
sat
on
the
bench
to
``
catch
the
favorable
moment
,
''
as
he
*NL*
expressed
it
.
Profound
dejection
clung
about
his
soul
like
a
heavy
mist
.
A
*NL*
profound
,
intense
dejection
!
He
sat
thinking
,
but
could
reach
no
*NL*
conclusion
.
The
candle
burnt
dimly
,
a
cricket
chirped
;
it
became
*NL*
insufferably
close
in
the
overheated
room
.
He
suddenly
pictured
the
*NL*
garden
,
the
path
behind
the
garden
,
the
door
of
his
father
's
house
*NL*
mysteriously
opening
and
Grushenka
running
in
.
He
leapt
up
from
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
tragedy
!
''
he
said
,
grinding
his
teeth
.
Mechanically
he
went
up
to
*NL*
the
sleeping
man
and
looked
in
his
face
.
He
was
a
lean
,
middle-aged
*NL*
peasant
,
with
a
very
long
face
,
flaxen
curls
,
and
a
long
,
thin
,
reddish
*NL*
beard
,
wearing
a
blue
cotton
shirt
and
a
black
waistcoat
,
from
the
pocket
*NL*
of
which
peeped
the
chain
of
a
silver
watch
.
Mitya
looked
at
his
face
with
*NL*
intense
hatred
,
and
for
some
unknown
reason
his
curly
hair
particularly
*NL*
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
insufferably
humiliating
was
,
that
after
leaving
things
of
such
*NL*
importance
and
making
such
sacrifices
,
he
,
Mitya
,
utterly
worn
out
,
should
*NL*
with
business
of
such
urgency
be
standing
over
this
dolt
on
whom
his
whole
*NL*
fate
depended
,
while
he
snored
as
though
there
were
nothing
the
matter
,
as
*NL*
though
he
'd
dropped
from
another
planet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
irony
of
fate
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
and
,
quite
losing
his
head
,
he
fell
*NL*
again
to
rousing
the
tipsy
peasant
.
He
roused
him
with
a
sort
of
ferocity
,
*NL*
pulled
at
him
,
pushed
him
,
even
beat
him
;
but
after
five
minutes
of
vain
*NL*
exertions
,
he
returned
to
his
bench
in
helpless
despair
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stupid
!
Stupid
!
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
And
how
dishonorable
it
all
is
!
''
something
*NL*
made
him
add
.
His
head
began
to
ache
horribly
.
``
Should
he
fling
it
up
and
*NL*
go
away
altogether
?
''
he
wondered
.
``
No
,
wait
till
to-morrow
now
.
I
'll
stay
*NL*
on
purpose
.
What
else
did
I
come
for
?
Besides
,
I
've
no
means
of
going
.
How
*NL*
am
I
to
get
away
from
here
now
?
Oh
,
the
idiocy
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
head
ached
more
and
more
.
He
sat
without
moving
,
and
unconsciously
*NL*
dozed
off
and
fell
asleep
as
he
sat
.
He
seemed
to
have
slept
for
two
hours
*NL*
or
more
.
He
was
waked
up
by
his
head
aching
so
unbearably
that
he
could
*NL*
have
screamed
.
There
was
a
hammering
in
his
temples
,
and
the
top
of
his
*NL*
head
ached
.
It
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
wake
up
fully
and
*NL*
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
realized
that
the
room
was
full
of
charcoal
fumes
from
the
*NL*
stove
,
and
that
he
might
die
of
suffocation
.
And
the
drunken
peasant
still
*NL*
lay
snoring
.
The
candle
guttered
and
was
about
to
go
out
.
Mitya
cried
out
,
*NL*
and
ran
staggering
across
the
passage
into
the
forester
's
room
.
The
*NL*
forester
waked
up
at
once
,
but
hearing
that
the
other
room
was
full
of
*NL*
fumes
,
to
Mitya
's
surprise
and
annoyance
,
accepted
the
fact
with
strange
*NL*
unconcern
,
though
he
did
go
to
see
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
's
dead
,
he
's
dead
!
and
...
what
am
I
to
do
then
?
''
cried
Mitya
*NL*
frantically
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
threw
open
the
doors
,
opened
a
window
and
the
chimney
.
Mitya
brought
*NL*
a
pail
of
water
from
the
passage
.
First
he
wetted
his
own
head
,
then
,
*NL*
finding
a
rag
of
some
sort
,
dipped
it
into
the
water
,
and
put
it
on
*NL*
Lyagavy
's
head
.
The
forester
still
treated
the
matter
contemptuously
,
and
*NL*
when
he
opened
the
window
said
grumpily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
all
right
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
sleep
,
leaving
Mitya
a
lighted
lantern
.
Mitya
fussed
about
*NL*
the
drunken
peasant
for
half
an
hour
,
wetting
his
head
,
and
gravely
*NL*
resolved
not
to
sleep
all
night
.
But
he
was
so
worn
out
that
when
he
sat
*NL*
down
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
,
he
closed
his
eyes
,
unconsciously
*NL*
stretched
himself
full
length
on
the
bench
and
slept
like
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dreadfully
late
when
he
waked
.
It
was
somewhere
about
nine
o'clock
.
*NL*
The
sun
was
shining
brightly
in
the
two
little
windows
of
the
hut
.
The
*NL*
curly-headed
peasant
was
sitting
on
the
bench
and
had
his
coat
on
.
He
had
*NL*
another
samovar
and
another
bottle
in
front
of
him
.
Yesterday
's
bottle
had
*NL*
already
been
finished
,
and
the
new
one
was
more
than
half
empty
.
Mitya
*NL*
jumped
up
and
saw
at
once
that
the
cursed
peasant
was
drunk
again
,
*NL*
hopelessly
and
incurably
.
He
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
with
wide
opened
*NL*
eyes
.
The
peasant
was
silently
and
slyly
watching
him
,
with
insulting
*NL*
composure
,
and
even
a
sort
of
contemptuous
condescension
,
so
Mitya
*NL*
fancied
.
He
rushed
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
you
see
...
I
...
you
've
most
likely
heard
from
the
forester
*NL*
here
in
the
hut
.
I
'm
Lieutenant
Dmitri
Karamazov
,
the
son
of
the
old
*NL*
Karamazov
whose
copse
you
are
buying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
lie
!
''
said
the
peasant
,
calmly
and
confidently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lie
?
You
know
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
any
of
your
Fyodor
Pavlovitches
,
''
said
the
peasant
,
speaking
*NL*
thickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
bargaining
with
him
for
the
copse
,
for
the
copse
.
Do
wake
up
,
and
*NL*
collect
yourself
.
Father
Pavel
of
Ilyinskoe
brought
me
here
.
You
wrote
to
*NL*
Samsonov
,
and
he
has
sent
me
to
you
,
''
Mitya
gasped
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
l-lying
!
''
Lyagavy
blurted
out
again
.
Mitya
's
legs
went
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
mercy
's
sake
!
It
is
n't
a
joke
!
You
're
drunk
,
perhaps
.
Yet
you
can
*NL*
speak
and
understand
...
or
else
...
I
understand
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
painter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
mercy
's
sake
!
I
'm
Karamazov
,
Dmitri
Karamazov
.
I
have
an
offer
to
*NL*
make
you
,
an
advantageous
offer
...
very
advantageous
offer
,
concerning
*NL*
the
copse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasant
stroked
his
beard
importantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
've
contracted
for
the
job
and
turned
out
a
scamp
.
You
're
a
*NL*
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
you
're
mistaken
,
''
cried
Mitya
,
wringing
his
hands
in
*NL*
despair
.
The
peasant
still
stroked
his
beard
,
and
suddenly
screwed
up
his
*NL*
eyes
cunningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
show
me
this
:
you
tell
me
the
law
that
allows
roguery
.
D'you
*NL*
hear
?
You
're
a
scoundrel
!
Do
you
understand
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
stepped
back
gloomily
,
and
suddenly
``
something
seemed
to
hit
him
on
*NL*
the
head
,
''
as
he
said
afterwards
.
In
an
instant
a
light
seemed
to
dawn
in
*NL*
his
mind
,
``
a
light
was
kindled
and
I
grasped
it
all
.
''
He
stood
,
stupefied
,
*NL*
wondering
how
he
,
after
all
a
man
of
intelligence
,
could
have
yielded
to
*NL*
such
folly
,
have
been
led
into
such
an
adventure
,
and
have
kept
it
up
for
*NL*
almost
twenty-four
hours
,
fussing
round
this
Lyagavy
,
wetting
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
man
's
drunk
,
dead
drunk
,
and
he
'll
go
on
drinking
now
for
a
*NL*
week
;
what
's
the
use
of
waiting
here
?
And
what
if
Samsonov
sent
me
here
on
*NL*
purpose
?
What
if
she
--
?
Oh
,
God
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasant
sat
watching
him
and
grinning
.
Another
time
Mitya
might
have
*NL*
killed
the
fool
in
a
fury
,
but
now
he
felt
as
weak
as
a
child
.
He
went
*NL*
quietly
to
the
bench
,
took
up
his
overcoat
,
put
it
on
without
a
word
,
and
*NL*
went
out
of
the
hut
.
He
did
not
find
the
forester
in
the
next
room
;
there
*NL*
was
no
one
there
.
He
took
fifty
kopecks
in
small
change
out
of
his
pocket
*NL*
and
put
them
on
the
table
for
his
night
's
lodging
,
the
candle
,
and
the
*NL*
trouble
he
had
given
.
Coming
out
of
the
hut
he
saw
nothing
but
forest
all
*NL*
round
.
He
walked
at
hazard
,
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
out
of
the
hut
,
*NL*
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
.
Hurrying
there
the
evening
before
with
the
*NL*
priest
,
he
had
not
noticed
the
road
.
He
had
no
revengeful
feeling
for
*NL*
anybody
,
even
for
Samsonov
,
in
his
heart
.
He
strode
along
a
narrow
forest
*NL*
path
,
aimless
,
dazed
,
without
heeding
where
he
was
going
.
A
child
could
*NL*
have
knocked
him
down
,
so
weak
was
he
in
body
and
soul
.
He
got
out
of
the
*NL*
forest
somehow
,
however
,
and
a
vista
of
fields
,
bare
after
the
harvest
,
*NL*
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
despair
!
What
death
all
round
!
''
he
repeated
,
striding
on
and
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
saved
by
meeting
an
old
merchant
who
was
being
driven
across
*NL*
country
in
a
hired
trap
.
When
he
overtook
him
,
Mitya
asked
the
way
,
and
it
*NL*
turned
out
that
the
old
merchant
,
too
,
was
going
to
Volovya
.
After
some
*NL*
discussion
Mitya
got
into
the
trap
.
Three
hours
later
they
arrived
.
At
*NL*
Volovya
,
Mitya
at
once
ordered
posting-horses
to
drive
to
the
town
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
appallingly
hungry
.
While
the
horses
were
*NL*
being
harnessed
,
an
omelette
was
prepared
for
him
.
He
ate
it
all
in
an
*NL*
instant
,
ate
a
huge
hunk
of
bread
,
ate
a
sausage
,
and
swallowed
three
*NL*
glasses
of
vodka
.
After
eating
,
his
spirits
and
his
heart
grew
lighter
.
He
*NL*
flew
towards
the
town
,
urged
on
the
driver
,
and
suddenly
made
a
new
and
*NL*
``
unalterable
''
plan
to
procure
that
``
accursed
money
''
before
evening
.
``
And
*NL*
to
think
,
only
to
think
that
a
man
's
life
should
be
ruined
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
that
paltry
three
thousand
!
''
he
cried
,
contemptuously
.
``
I
'll
settle
it
to
-
*NL*
day
.
''
And
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
Grushenka
and
of
what
*NL*
might
have
happened
to
her
,
which
never
left
him
,
he
would
perhaps
have
*NL*
become
quite
cheerful
again
...
But
the
thought
of
her
was
stabbing
him
to
*NL*
the
heart
every
moment
,
like
a
sharp
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
arrived
,
and
Mitya
at
once
ran
to
Grushenka
.

Chapter

Gold-Mines
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
visit
of
Mitya
of
which
Grushenka
had
spoken
to
Rakitin
with
*NL*
such
horror
.
She
was
just
then
expecting
the
``
message
,
''
and
was
much
*NL*
relieved
that
Mitya
had
not
been
to
see
her
that
day
or
the
day
before
.
*NL*
She
hoped
that
``
please
God
he
wo
n't
come
till
I
'm
gone
away
,
''
and
he
*NL*
suddenly
burst
in
on
her
.
The
rest
we
know
already
.
To
get
him
off
her
*NL*
hands
she
suggested
at
once
that
he
should
walk
with
her
to
Samsonov
's
,
*NL*
where
she
said
she
absolutely
must
go
``
to
settle
his
accounts
,
''
and
when
*NL*
Mitya
accompanied
her
at
once
,
she
said
good-by
to
him
at
the
gate
,
making
*NL*
him
promise
to
come
at
twelve
o'clock
to
take
her
home
again
.
Mitya
,
too
,
*NL*
was
delighted
at
this
arrangement
.
If
she
was
sitting
at
Samsonov
's
she
*NL*
could
not
be
going
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
,
``
if
only
she
's
not
lying
,
''
he
*NL*
added
at
once
.
But
he
thought
she
was
not
lying
from
what
he
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
that
sort
of
jealous
man
who
,
in
the
absence
of
the
beloved
woman
,
*NL*
at
once
invents
all
sorts
of
awful
fancies
of
what
may
be
happening
to
*NL*
her
,
and
how
she
may
be
betraying
him
,
but
,
when
shaken
,
heartbroken
,
*NL*
convinced
of
her
faithlessness
,
he
runs
back
to
her
;
at
the
first
glance
*NL*
at
her
face
,
her
gay
,
laughing
,
affectionate
face
,
he
revives
at
once
,
*NL*
lays
aside
all
suspicion
and
with
joyful
shame
abuses
himself
for
his
*NL*
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
Grushenka
at
the
gate
he
rushed
home
.
Oh
,
he
had
so
much
*NL*
still
to
do
that
day
!
But
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
must
only
make
haste
and
find
out
from
Smerdyakov
whether
anything
*NL*
happened
there
last
night
,
whether
,
by
any
chance
,
she
went
to
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
;
ough
!
''
floated
through
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
had
time
to
reach
his
lodging
,
jealousy
had
surged
up
again
in
*NL*
his
restless
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jealousy
!
``
Othello
was
not
jealous
,
he
was
trustful
,
''
observed
Pushkin
.
*NL*
And
that
remark
alone
is
enough
to
show
the
deep
insight
of
our
great
*NL*
poet
.
Othello
's
soul
was
shattered
and
his
whole
outlook
clouded
simply
*NL*
because
_
his
ideal
was
destroyed
_
.
But
Othello
did
not
begin
hiding
,
*NL*
spying
,
peeping
.
He
was
trustful
,
on
the
contrary
.
He
had
to
be
led
up
,
*NL*
pushed
on
,
excited
with
great
difficulty
before
he
could
entertain
the
*NL*
idea
of
deceit
.
The
truly
jealous
man
is
not
like
that
.
It
is
impossible
*NL*
to
picture
to
oneself
the
shame
and
moral
degradation
to
which
the
jealous
*NL*
man
can
descend
without
a
qualm
of
conscience
.
And
yet
it
's
not
as
though
*NL*
the
jealous
were
all
vulgar
and
base
souls
.
On
the
contrary
,
a
man
of
*NL*
lofty
feelings
,
whose
love
is
pure
and
full
of
self-sacrifice
,
may
yet
*NL*
hide
under
tables
,
bribe
the
vilest
people
,
and
be
familiar
with
the
*NL*
lowest
ignominy
of
spying
and
eavesdropping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Othello
was
incapable
of
making
up
his
mind
to
faithlessness
--
not
incapable
*NL*
of
forgiving
it
,
but
of
making
up
his
mind
to
it
--
though
his
soul
was
as
*NL*
innocent
and
free
from
malice
as
a
babe
's
.
It
is
not
so
with
the
really
*NL*
jealous
man
.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
what
some
jealous
men
can
make
up
their
*NL*
mind
to
and
overlook
,
and
what
they
can
forgive
!
The
jealous
are
the
*NL*
readiest
of
all
to
forgive
,
and
all
women
know
it
.
The
jealous
man
can
*NL*
forgive
extraordinarily
quickly
-LRB-
though
,
of
course
,
after
a
violent
*NL*
scene
-RRB-
,
and
he
is
able
to
forgive
infidelity
almost
conclusively
proved
,
*NL*
the
very
kisses
and
embraces
he
has
seen
,
if
only
he
can
somehow
be
*NL*
convinced
that
it
has
all
been
``
for
the
last
time
,
''
and
that
his
rival
*NL*
will
vanish
from
that
day
forward
,
will
depart
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
*NL*
or
that
he
himself
will
carry
her
away
somewhere
,
where
that
dreaded
rival
*NL*
will
not
get
near
her
.
Of
course
the
reconciliation
is
only
for
an
hour
.
*NL*
For
,
even
if
the
rival
did
disappear
next
day
,
he
would
invent
another
one
*NL*
and
would
be
jealous
of
him
.
And
one
might
wonder
what
there
was
in
a
love
*NL*
that
had
to
be
so
watched
over
,
what
a
love
could
be
worth
that
needed
*NL*
such
strenuous
guarding
.
But
that
the
jealous
will
never
understand
.
And
*NL*
yet
among
them
are
men
of
noble
hearts
.
It
is
remarkable
,
too
,
that
those
*NL*
very
men
of
noble
hearts
,
standing
hidden
in
some
cupboard
,
listening
and
*NL*
spying
,
never
feel
the
stings
of
conscience
at
that
moment
,
anyway
,
though
*NL*
they
understand
clearly
enough
with
their
``
noble
hearts
''
the
shameful
*NL*
depths
to
which
they
have
voluntarily
sunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
Grushenka
,
Mitya
's
jealousy
vanished
,
and
,
for
an
instant
*NL*
he
became
trustful
and
generous
,
and
positively
despised
himself
for
his
*NL*
evil
feelings
.
But
it
only
proved
that
,
in
his
love
for
the
woman
,
there
*NL*
was
an
element
of
something
far
higher
than
he
himself
imagined
,
that
it
*NL*
was
not
only
a
sensual
passion
,
not
only
the
``
curve
of
her
body
,
''
of
which
*NL*
he
had
talked
to
Alyosha
.
But
,
as
soon
as
Grushenka
had
gone
,
Mitya
began
*NL*
to
suspect
her
of
all
the
low
cunning
of
faithlessness
,
and
he
felt
no
*NL*
sting
of
conscience
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
jealousy
surged
up
in
him
again
.
He
had
,
in
any
case
,
to
make
*NL*
haste
.
The
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
hold
of
at
least
a
small
,
*NL*
temporary
loan
of
money
.
The
nine
roubles
had
almost
all
gone
on
his
*NL*
expedition
.
And
,
as
we
all
know
,
one
ca
n't
take
a
step
without
money
.
But
*NL*
he
had
thought
over
in
the
cart
where
he
could
get
a
loan
.
He
had
a
brace
*NL*
of
fine
dueling
pistols
in
a
case
,
which
he
had
not
pawned
till
then
*NL*
because
he
prized
them
above
all
his
possessions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
``
Metropolis
''
tavern
he
had
some
time
since
made
acquaintance
with
a
*NL*
young
official
and
had
learnt
that
this
very
opulent
bachelor
was
*NL*
passionately
fond
of
weapons
.
He
used
to
buy
pistols
,
revolvers
,
daggers
,
*NL*
hang
them
on
his
wall
and
show
them
to
acquaintances
.
He
prided
himself
on
*NL*
them
,
and
was
quite
a
specialist
on
the
mechanism
of
the
revolver
.
Mitya
,
*NL*
without
stopping
to
think
,
went
straight
to
him
,
and
offered
to
pawn
his
*NL*
pistols
to
him
for
ten
roubles
.
The
official
,
delighted
,
began
trying
to
*NL*
persuade
him
to
sell
them
outright
.
But
Mitya
would
not
consent
,
so
the
*NL*
young
man
gave
him
ten
roubles
,
protesting
that
nothing
would
induce
him
*NL*
to
take
interest
.
They
parted
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
in
haste
;
he
rushed
towards
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
by
the
back
way
,
*NL*
to
his
arbor
,
to
get
hold
of
Smerdyakov
as
soon
as
possible
.
In
this
way
*NL*
the
fact
was
established
that
three
or
four
hours
before
a
certain
event
,
*NL*
of
which
I
shall
speak
later
on
,
Mitya
had
not
a
farthing
,
and
pawned
for
*NL*
ten
roubles
a
possession
he
valued
,
though
,
three
hours
later
,
he
was
in
*NL*
possession
of
thousands
...
But
I
am
anticipating
.
From
Marya
Kondratyevna
*NL*
-LRB-
the
woman
living
near
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
-RRB-
he
learned
the
very
disturbing
*NL*
fact
of
Smerdyakov
's
illness
.
He
heard
the
story
of
his
fall
in
the
*NL*
cellar
,
his
fit
,
the
doctor
's
visit
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
anxiety
;
he
heard
*NL*
with
interest
,
too
,
that
his
brother
Ivan
had
set
off
that
morning
for
*NL*
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
must
have
driven
through
Volovya
before
me
,
''
thought
Dmitri
,
but
*NL*
he
was
terribly
distressed
about
Smerdyakov
.
``
What
will
happen
now
?
Who
'll
*NL*
keep
watch
for
me
?
Who
'll
bring
me
word
?
''
he
thought
.
He
began
greedily
*NL*
questioning
the
women
whether
they
had
seen
anything
the
evening
before
.
*NL*
They
quite
understood
what
he
was
trying
to
find
out
,
and
completely
*NL*
reassured
him
.
No
one
had
been
there
.
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
had
been
there
the
*NL*
night
;
everything
had
been
perfectly
as
usual
.
Mitya
grew
thoughtful
.
He
*NL*
would
certainly
have
to
keep
watch
to-day
,
but
where
?
Here
or
at
*NL*
Samsonov
's
gate
?
He
decided
that
he
must
be
on
the
look
out
both
here
and
*NL*
there
,
and
meanwhile
...
meanwhile
...
The
difficulty
was
that
he
had
to
*NL*
carry
out
the
new
plan
that
he
had
made
on
the
journey
back
.
He
was
sure
*NL*
of
its
success
,
but
he
must
not
delay
acting
upon
it
.
Mitya
resolved
to
*NL*
sacrifice
an
hour
to
it
:
``
In
an
hour
I
shall
know
everything
,
I
shall
*NL*
settle
everything
,
and
then
,
then
,
first
of
all
to
Samsonov
's
.
I
'll
*NL*
inquire
whether
Grushenka
's
there
and
instantly
be
back
here
again
,
stay
*NL*
till
eleven
,
and
then
to
Samsonov
's
again
to
bring
her
home
.
''
This
was
*NL*
what
he
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
flew
home
,
washed
,
combed
his
hair
,
brushed
his
clothes
,
dressed
,
and
*NL*
went
to
Madame
Hohlakov
's
.
Alas
!
he
had
built
his
hopes
on
her
.
He
had
*NL*
resolved
to
borrow
three
thousand
from
that
lady
.
And
what
was
more
,
he
*NL*
felt
suddenly
convinced
that
she
would
not
refuse
to
lend
it
to
him
.
It
*NL*
may
be
wondered
why
,
if
he
felt
so
certain
,
he
had
not
gone
to
her
at
*NL*
first
,
one
of
his
own
sort
,
so
to
speak
,
instead
of
to
Samsonov
,
a
man
he
*NL*
did
not
know
,
who
was
not
of
his
own
class
,
and
to
whom
he
hardly
knew
how
*NL*
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
fact
was
that
he
had
never
known
Madame
Hohlakov
well
,
and
had
*NL*
seen
nothing
of
her
for
the
last
month
,
and
that
he
knew
she
could
not
*NL*
endure
him
.
She
had
detested
him
from
the
first
because
he
was
engaged
to
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
while
she
had
,
for
some
reason
,
suddenly
conceived
the
*NL*
desire
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
should
throw
him
over
,
and
marry
the
*NL*
``
charming
,
chivalrously
refined
Ivan
,
who
had
such
excellent
manners
.
''
*NL*
Mitya
's
manners
she
detested
.
Mitya
positively
laughed
at
her
,
and
had
*NL*
once
said
about
her
that
she
was
just
as
lively
and
at
her
ease
as
she
was
*NL*
uncultivated
.
But
that
morning
in
the
cart
a
brilliant
idea
had
struck
*NL*
him
:
``
If
she
is
so
anxious
I
should
not
marry
Katerina
Ivanovna
''
-LRB-
and
he
*NL*
knew
she
was
positively
hysterical
upon
the
subject
-RRB-
``
why
should
she
*NL*
refuse
me
now
that
three
thousand
,
just
to
enable
me
to
leave
Katya
and
*NL*
get
away
from
her
for
ever
.
These
spoilt
fine
ladies
,
if
they
set
their
*NL*
hearts
on
anything
,
will
spare
no
expense
to
satisfy
their
caprice
.
*NL*
Besides
,
she
's
so
rich
,
''
Mitya
argued
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
his
``
plan
''
it
was
just
the
same
as
before
;
it
consisted
of
the
*NL*
offer
of
his
rights
to
Tchermashnya
--
but
not
with
a
commercial
object
,
as
*NL*
it
had
been
with
Samsonov
,
not
trying
to
allure
the
lady
with
the
*NL*
possibility
of
making
a
profit
of
six
or
seven
thousand
--
but
simply
as
a
*NL*
security
for
the
debt
.
As
he
worked
out
this
new
idea
,
Mitya
was
enchanted
*NL*
with
it
,
but
so
it
always
was
with
him
in
all
his
undertakings
,
in
all
his
*NL*
sudden
decisions
.
He
gave
himself
up
to
every
new
idea
with
passionate
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
Yet
,
when
he
mounted
the
steps
of
Madame
Hohlakov
's
house
he
*NL*
felt
a
shiver
of
fear
run
down
his
spine
.
At
that
moment
he
saw
fully
,
as
*NL*
a
mathematical
certainty
,
that
this
was
his
last
hope
,
that
if
this
broke
*NL*
down
,
nothing
else
was
left
him
in
the
world
,
but
to
``
rob
and
murder
some
*NL*
one
for
the
three
thousand
.
''
It
was
half-past
seven
when
he
rang
at
the
*NL*
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
fortune
seemed
to
smile
upon
him
.
As
soon
as
he
was
announced
he
*NL*
was
received
with
extraordinary
rapidity
.
``
As
though
she
were
waiting
for
*NL*
me
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
been
led
to
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
ran
in
,
and
declared
at
once
that
she
was
*NL*
expecting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
expecting
you
!
I
was
expecting
you
!
Though
I
'd
no
reason
to
suppose
*NL*
you
would
come
to
see
me
,
as
you
will
admit
yourself
.
Yet
,
I
did
expect
*NL*
you
.
You
may
marvel
at
my
instinct
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
but
I
was
*NL*
convinced
all
the
morning
that
you
would
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
certainly
wonderful
,
madam
,
''
observed
Mitya
,
sitting
down
limply
,
*NL*
``
but
I
have
come
to
you
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
...
On
a
matter
of
*NL*
supreme
importance

that

*NL*
*NL*

reactionary
harking
back
to

miraculous
*NL*
-LRB-

you
heard
about
Father
Zossima

This
is
a

Mitya
was
a
little
*NL*
surprised
.
The
image
of
Alyosha
rose
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
night

Madame

cut
in
at
once

``
The

not
three

three
million

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
in
less
than
no

I
'll
make
you
a
present

idea
:
you
shall
find
gold-mines
,
make
millions
,
return
and
become
a
*NL*
leading
man
,
and
wake
us
up

Are
we
to
leave
*NL*
it
all
to
the
Jews
?
You
will
found
institutions

enterprises

all

You
will
help
the

they
will
bless
you

This

the
age

You
'll
become
famous

indispensable
to

the
Department
of
Finance

which
is
so
badly
off
at

The
*NL*
depreciation
of
the
rouble
keeps
me
awake
at
night

Dmitri

;
*NL*
people
do
n't

Dmitri
interrupted
with
an
uneasy

*NL*
*NL*

Enough

Dmitri

Madame
Hohlakov
interrupted
*NL*
emphatically
.
``
The
question
is

will
you
go

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

cried
Madame
Hohlakov
.
And
jumping
up
and
running
to
a
handsome
*NL*
bureau
with
numerous
little
drawers
,
she
began
pulling
out
one
drawer
*NL*
after
another
,
looking
for
something
with
desperate
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
three

thought
Mitya
,
his
heart
almost
stopping
,
``

at

the
instant

without

that
's
doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

cried
Madame
Hohlakov
,
running
back
joyfully
to
Mitya
,
``
here
is
*NL*
what
I
was
looking
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
tiny
silver
ikon
on
a
cord
,
such
as
is
sometimes
worn
next
the
*NL*
skin
with
a
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
from
Kiev
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
she
went
on
reverently
,
``
from
*NL*
the
relics
of
the
Holy
Martyr

Let
me
put
it
on
your

*NL*

with
it
dedicate
you
to

new
life

to
a
new
career

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
actually
put
the
cord
round
his
neck
,
and
began
arranging
it
.
In
*NL*
extreme
embarrassment
,
Mitya
bent
down
and
helped
her
,
and
at
last
he
got
*NL*
it
under
his
neck-tie
and
collar
through
his
shirt
to
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
can
set
off
,
''
Madame
Hohlakov
pronounced
,
sitting
down
*NL*
triumphantly
in
her
place
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
I
am
so
touched

I
do
n't
know
how
to

indeed

such
kindness

...
If

you
knew
how
precious
time
is

*NL*
That
sum
of
money
,
for
which
I
shall
be

your
generosity

*NL*
Oh
,
madam
,
since
you
are
so
kind
,
so
touchingly
generous
to
me
,
''
Mitya
*NL*
exclaimed
impulsively
,
``
then
let
me
reveal
to
you

though
,
of
course
,
*NL*
you
've
known
it
a
long

that
I
love

here

I
have
been
*NL*
false
to
Katya

Katerina
Ivanovna
I
should
say
...
Oh
,
I
've
behaved
*NL*
inhumanly
,
dishonorably
to
her
,

I
fell
in
love
here
with
another
woman
*NL*
...
a
woman
whom
you
,
madam
,
perhaps
,
despise
,
for
you
know
everything
*NL*
already
,
but
whom
I
can
not
leave
on
any
account
,
and
therefore
that
three
*NL*
thousand
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
everything

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
Madame
Hohlakov
interrupted
in
*NL*
the
most
decisive
tone
.
``
Leave
everything
,
especially
women
.
Gold-mines
*NL*
are
your
goal
,
and
there
's
no
place
for

there
.
Afterwards
,
when
you
*NL*
come
back
rich
and
famous
,
you
will
find
the
girl
of
your
heart
in
the
*NL*
highest
society
.
That
will
be
a
modern
girl
,
a
girl
of
education
and
*NL*
advanced
ideas
.
By
that
time
the
dawning
woman
question
will
have
gained
*NL*
ground
,
and
the
new
woman
will
have
appeared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
that
's
not
the
point
,
not
at
all

''
Mitya
clasped
his
hands
in
*NL*
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
just
what
you
need
;
the
very
thing
*NL*
you
're
yearning
for
,
though
you
do
n't
realize
it
yourself
.
I
am
not
at
all
*NL*
opposed
to
the
present
woman
movement
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
The
*NL*
development
of
woman
,
and
even
the
political
emancipation
of
woman
in
the
*NL*
near
future
--
that
's
my
ideal
.
I
've
a
daughter
myself
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
people
do
n't
know
that
side
of
me
.
I
wrote
a
letter
to
the
author
,
*NL*
Shtchedrin
,
on
that
subject
.
He
has
taught
me
so
much
,
so
much
about
the
*NL*
vocation
of
woman
.
So
last
year
I
sent
him
an
anonymous
letter
of
two
*NL*
lines
:
'
I
kiss
and
embrace
you
,
my
teacher
,
for
the
modern
woman
.
*NL*
Persevere
.
'
And
I
signed
myself
,
'
A
Mother
.
'
I
thought
of
signing
myself
*NL*
'
A
contemporary
Mother
,
'
and
hesitated
,
but
I
stuck
to
the
simple
*NL*
`
Mother
'
;
there
's
more
moral
beauty
in
that
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
And
the
*NL*
word
`
contemporary
'
might
have
reminded
him
of
'
_
The
Contemporary
_
'
--
a
*NL*
painful
recollection
owing
to
the
censorship
...
Good
Heavens
,
what
is
the
*NL*
matter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
jumping
up
at
last
,
clasping
his
hands
before
her
in
*NL*
helpless
entreaty
.
``
You
will
make
me
weep
if
you
delay
what
you
have
so
*NL*
generously

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

a
path
lies
open
before
you

Tears
will
ease
your
heart
,
and
later
on
*NL*
you
will
return
rejoicing

You
will
hasten
to
me
from
Siberia
on
purpose

to
share
your
joy
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
allow
me

too
!

Mitya
cried
suddenly
.
``
For
the
last
time
I
entreat
*NL*
you

tell
me

can
I
have
the
sum

*NL*
*NL*
``

Madame
*NL*
Hohlakov
announced
with
serene
amazement
.
Mitya
was
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
said
just
now
...
you
said

you
said
it

good

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

you
misunderstood

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

In
that
case
you
*NL*
misunderstood
me

I
was
talking
of
the
gold-mines
.
It
's
true
I
promised
*NL*
you
more
,
infinitely
more
than
three
thousand
,
I
remember
it
all
now
,
but
*NL*
I
was
referring
to
the
gold-mines
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
money
?
The
three
thousand
?
''
Mitya
exclaimed
,
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
meant
money
,
I
have
n't
any
.
I
have
n't
a
penny
,
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
.
I
'm
quarreling
with
my
steward
about
it
,
and
I
've
just
*NL*
borrowed
five
hundred
roubles
from
Miuesov
,
myself
.
No
,
no
,
I
've
no

*NL*
And
,
do
you
know

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
if
I
had
,
I
would
n't
give
it
to
*NL*
you
.
In
the
first
place
I
never
lend
money
.
Lending
money
means
losing
*NL*
friends
.
And
I
would
n't
give
it
to
you
particularly
.
I
would
n't
give
it
*NL*
you
,
because
I
like
you
and
want
to
save
you
,
for
all
you
need
is
the
*NL*
gold-mines
,
the
gold-mines
,
the
gold-mines
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
devil
!
''
roared
Mitya
,
and
with
all
his
might
brought
his
fist
*NL*
down
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aie
!
Aie
!
''
cried
Madame
Hohlakov
,
alarmed
,
and
she
flew
to
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
spat
on
the
ground
,
and
strode
rapidly
out
of
the
room
,
out
of
the
*NL*
house
,
into
the
street
,
into
the
darkness
!
He
walked
like
one
possessed
,
*NL*
and
beating
himself
on
the
breast
,
on
the
spot
where
he
had
struck
himself
*NL*
two
days
previously
,
before
Alyosha
,
the
last
time
he
saw
him
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
on
the
road
.
What
those
blows
upon
his
breast
signified
,
_
on
that
spot
_
,
*NL*
and
what
he
meant
by
it
--
that
was
,
for
the
time
,
a
secret
which
was
known
*NL*
to
no
one
in
the
world
,
and
had
not
been
told
even
to
Alyosha
.
But
that
*NL*
secret
meant
for
him
more
than
disgrace
;
it
meant
ruin
,
suicide
.
So
he
had
*NL*
determined
,
if
he
did
not
get
hold
of
the
three
thousand
that
would
pay
*NL*
his
debt
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
so
remove
from
his
breast
,
from
_
that
*NL*
spot
on
his
breast
_
,
the
shame
he
carried
upon
it
,
that
weighed
on
his
*NL*
conscience
.
All
this
will
be
fully
explained
to
the
reader
later
on
,
but
*NL*
now
that
his
last
hope
had
vanished
,
this
man
,
so
strong
in
appearance
,
*NL*
burst
out
crying
like
a
little
child
a
few
steps
from
the
Hohlakovs
'
*NL*
house
.
He
walked
on
,
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
,
wiped
away
his
*NL*
tears
with
his
fist
.
In
this
way
he
reached
the
square
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
became
aware
that
he
had
stumbled
against
something
.
He
heard
a
piercing
*NL*
wail
from
an
old
woman
whom
he
had
almost
knocked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
you
've
nearly
killed
me
!
Why
do
n't
you
look
where
you
're
*NL*
going
,
scapegrace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
you
!

cried
Mitya
,
recognizing
the
old
woman
in
the
dark
.
It
*NL*
was
the
old
servant
who
waited
on
Samsonov
,
whom
Mitya
had
particularly
*NL*
noticed
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
are
you
,
my
good
sir

said
the
old
woman
,
in
quite
a
different
*NL*
voice
.
``
I
do
n't
know
you
in
the
dark

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
live

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

good
woman

Agrafena
Alexandrovna
there
now

said
Mitya
,
*NL*
beside
himself
with
suspense
.
``
I
saw
her
to
the
house
some
time
ago

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
there

She
stayed
a
little
while
,
and
went
off
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Went
away
?
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
When
did
she
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
soon
as
she
came
.
She
only
stayed
a
minute
.
She
only
told
Kuzma
*NL*
Kuzmitch
a
tale
that
made
him
laugh
,
and
then
she
ran
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
lying
,
damn
you
!
''
roared
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aie
!
Aie

''
shrieked
the
old
woman
,
but
Mitya
had
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
with
all
his
might
to
the
house
where
Grushenka
lived
.
At
the
*NL*
moment
he
reached
it
,
Grushenka
was
on
her
way
to
Mokroe
.
It
was
not
more
*NL*
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
her
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fenya
was
sitting
with
her
grandmother
,
the
old
cook
,
Matryona
,
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
when
``
the
captain
''
ran
in
.
Fenya
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
on
*NL*
seeing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
scream
?
''
roared
Mitya
,
``
where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
without
giving
the
terror-stricken
Fenya
time
to
utter
a
word
,
he
fell
*NL*
all
of
a
heap
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fenya

Fenya
swore
and
protested
.
``
You

*NL*
``
Indeed
she
did
n't
.
By
God
I
swear
she
did
n't
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
lying
!
''
shouted
Mitya
.
``
From
your
terror
I
know
where
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
away
.
Fenya
in
her
fright
was
glad
she
had
got
off
so
easily
.
*NL*
But
she
knew
very
well
that
it
was
only
that
he
was
in
such
haste
,
or
she
*NL*
might
not
have
fared
so
well
.
But
as
he
ran
,
he
surprised
both
Fenya
and
*NL*
old
Matryona
by
an
unexpected
action
.
On
the
table
stood
a
brass
mortar
,
*NL*
with
a
pestle
in
it
,
a
small
brass
pestle
,
not
much
more
than
six
inches
*NL*
long
.
Mitya
already
had
opened
the
door
with
one
hand
when
,
with
the
*NL*
other
,
he
snatched
up
the
pestle
,
and
thrust
it
in
his
side-pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
He
's
going
to
murder
some
one
!
''
cried
Fenya
,
flinging
up
her
*NL*
hands
.

Chapter
IV

In
The
Dark
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Where
was
he
running
?
``
Where
could
she
be
except
at
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
?
*NL*
She
must
have
run
straight
to
him
from
Samsonov
's
,
that
was
clear
now
.
The
*NL*
whole
intrigue
,
the
whole
deceit
was
evident
.
''
...
It
all
rushed
whirling
*NL*
through
his
mind
.
He
did
not
run
to
Marya
Kondratyevna
's
.
``
There
was
no
*NL*
need
to
go
there
...
not
the
slightest
need
...
he
must
raise
no
alarm
...
*NL*
they
would
run
and
tell
directly
...
Marya
Kondratyevna
was
clearly
in
the
*NL*
plot
,
Smerdyakov
too
,
he
too
,
all
had
been
bought
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
formed
another
plan
of
action
:
he
ran
a
long
way
round
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
house
,
crossing
the
lane
,
running
down
Dmitrovsky
Street
,
*NL*
then
over
the
little
bridge
,
and
so
came
straight
to
the
deserted
alley
at
*NL*
the
back
,
which
was
empty
and
uninhabited
,
with
,
on
one
side
the
hurdle
*NL*
fence
of
a
neighbor
's
kitchen-garden
,
on
the
other
the
strong
high
fence
,
*NL*
that
ran
all
round
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
garden
.
Here
he
chose
a
spot
,
*NL*
apparently
the
very
place
,
where
according
to
the
tradition
,
he
knew
*NL*
Lizaveta
had
once
climbed
over
it
:
``
If
she
could
climb
over
it
,
''
the
*NL*
thought
,
God
knows
why
,
occurred
to
him
,
``
surely
I
can
.
''
He
did
in
fact
*NL*
jump
up
,
and
instantly
contrived
to
catch
hold
of
the
top
of
the
fence
.
*NL*
Then
he
vigorously
pulled
himself
up
and
sat
astride
on
it
.
Close
by
,
in
*NL*
the
garden
stood
the
bath-house
,
but
from
the
fence
he
could
see
the
*NL*
lighted
windows
of
the
house
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
old
man
's
bedroom
is
lighted
up
.
She
's
there
!
''
and
he
leapt
from
*NL*
the
fence
into
the
garden
.
Though
he
knew
Grigory
was
ill
and
very
likely
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
too
,
and
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
,
he
instinctively
*NL*
hid
himself
,
stood
still
,
and
began
to
listen
.
But
there
was
dead
silence
*NL*
on
all
sides
and
,
as
though
of
design
,
complete
stillness
,
not
the
*NL*
slightest
breath
of
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
naught
but
the
whispering
silence
,
''
the
line
for
some
reason
rose
to
*NL*
his
mind
.
``
If
only
no
one
heard
me
jump
over
the
fence
!
I
think
not
.
''
*NL*
Standing
still
for
a
minute
,
he
walked
softly
over
the
grass
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
avoiding
the
trees
and
shrubs
.
He
walked
slowly
,
creeping
*NL*
stealthily
at
every
step
,
listening
to
his
own
footsteps
.
It
took
him
five
*NL*
minutes
to
reach
the
lighted
window
.
He
remembered
that
just
under
the
*NL*
window
there
were
several
thick
and
high
bushes
of
elder
and
whitebeam
.
*NL*
The
door
from
the
house
into
the
garden
on
the
left-hand
side
,
was
shut
;
*NL*
he
had
carefully
looked
on
purpose
to
see
,
in
passing
.
At
last
he
reached
*NL*
the
bushes
and
hid
behind
them
.
He
held
his
breath
.
``
I
must
wait
now
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
``
to
reassure
them
,
in
case
they
heard
my
footsteps
and
are
*NL*
listening
...
if
only
I
do
n't
cough
or
sneeze
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
two
minutes
.
His
heart
was
beating
violently
,
and
,
at
moments
,
*NL*
he
could
scarcely
breathe
.
``
No
,
this
throbbing
at
my
heart
wo
n't
stop
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
I
ca
n't
wait
any
longer
.
''
He
was
standing
behind
a
bush
in
the
*NL*
shadow
.
The
light
of
the
window
fell
on
the
front
part
of
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
red
the
whitebeam
berries
are
!
''
he
murmured
,
not
knowing
why
.
Softly
*NL*
and
noiselessly
,
step
by
step
,
he
approached
the
window
,
and
raised
*NL*
himself
on
tiptoe
.
All
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
bedroom
lay
open
before
him
.
It
*NL*
was
not
a
large
room
,
and
was
divided
in
two
parts
by
a
red
screen
,
*NL*
``
Chinese
,
''
as
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
used
to
call
it
.
The
word
``
Chinese
''
*NL*
flashed
into
Mitya
's
mind
,
``
and
behind
the
screen
,
is
Grushenka
,
''
thought
*NL*
Mitya
.
He
began
watching
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
who
was
wearing
his
new
*NL*
striped-silk
dressing-gown
,
which
Mitya
had
never
seen
,
and
a
silk
cord
*NL*
with
tassels
round
the
waist
.
A
clean
,
dandified
shirt
of
fine
linen
with
*NL*
gold
studs
peeped
out
under
the
collar
of
the
dressing-gown
.
On
his
head
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
the
same
red
bandage
which
Alyosha
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
got
himself
up
,
''
thought
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
was
standing
near
the
window
,
apparently
lost
in
thought
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
jerked
up
his
head
,
listened
a
moment
,
and
hearing
nothing
*NL*
went
up
to
the
table
,
poured
out
half
a
glass
of
brandy
from
a
decanter
*NL*
and
drank
it
off
.
Then
he
uttered
a
deep
sigh
,
again
stood
still
a
moment
,
*NL*
walked
carelessly
up
to
the
looking-glass
on
the
wall
,
with
his
right
hand
*NL*
raised
the
red
bandage
on
his
forehead
a
little
,
and
began
examining
his
*NL*
bruises
and
scars
,
which
had
not
yet
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
alone
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
``
in
all
probability
he
's
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
moved
away
from
the
looking-glass
,
turned
suddenly
to
*NL*
the
window
and
looked
out
.
Mitya
instantly
slipped
away
into
the
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
be
there
behind
the
screen
.
Perhaps
she
's
asleep
by
now
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
moved
away
from
the
*NL*
window
.
``
He
's
looking
for
her
out
of
the
window
,
so
she
's
not
there
.
Why
*NL*
should
he
stare
out
into
the
dark
?
He
's
wild
with
impatience
.
''
...
Mitya
*NL*
slipped
back
at
once
,
and
fell
to
gazing
in
at
the
window
again
.
The
old
*NL*
man
was
sitting
down
at
the
table
,
apparently
disappointed
.
At
last
he
put
*NL*
his
elbow
on
the
table
,
and
laid
his
right
cheek
against
his
hand
.
Mitya
*NL*
watched
him
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
alone
,
he
's
alone
!
''
he
repeated
again
.
``
If
she
were
here
,
his
face
*NL*
would
be
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
a
queer
,
irrational
vexation
rose
up
in
his
heart
that
she
*NL*
was
not
here
.
``
It
's
not
that
she
's
not
here
,
''
he
explained
to
himself
,
*NL*
immediately
,
``
but
that
I
ca
n't
tell
for
certain
whether
she
is
or
not
.
''
*NL*
Mitya
remembered
afterwards
that
his
mind
was
at
that
moment
exceptionally
*NL*
clear
,
that
he
took
in
everything
to
the
slightest
detail
,
and
missed
no
*NL*
point
.
But
a
feeling
of
misery
,
the
misery
of
uncertainty
and
indecision
,
*NL*
was
growing
in
his
heart
with
every
instant
.
``
Is
she
here
or
not
?
''
The
*NL*
angry
doubt
filled
his
heart
,
and
suddenly
,
making
up
his
mind
,
he
put
out
*NL*
his
hand
and
softly
knocked
on
the
window
frame
.
He
knocked
the
signal
the
*NL*
old
man
had
agreed
upon
with
Smerdyakov
,
twice
slowly
and
then
three
times
*NL*
more
quickly
,
the
signal
that
meant
``
Grushenka
is
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
started
,
jerked
up
his
head
,
and
,
jumping
up
quickly
,
ran
to
*NL*
the
window
.
Mitya
slipped
away
into
the
shadow
.
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
opened
*NL*
the
window
and
thrust
his
whole
head
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grushenka
,
is
it
you
?
Is
it
you
?
''
he
said
,
in
a
sort
of
trembling
half
-
*NL*
whisper
.
``
Where
are
you
,
my
angel
,
where
are
you
?
''
He
was
fearfully
*NL*
agitated
and
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
alone
.
''
Mitya
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
?
''
cried
the
old
man
again
;
and
he
thrust
his
head
out
*NL*
farther
,
thrust
it
out
to
the
shoulders
,
gazing
in
all
directions
,
right
*NL*
and
left
.
``
Come
here
,
I
've
a
little
present
for
you
.
Come
,
I
'll
show
*NL*
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means
the
three
thousand
,
''
thought
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
you
?
Are
you
at
the
door
?
I
'll
open
it
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
old
man
almost
climbed
out
of
the
window
,
peering
out
to
the
*NL*
right
,
where
there
was
a
door
into
the
garden
,
trying
to
see
into
the
*NL*
darkness
.
In
another
second
he
would
certainly
have
run
out
to
open
the
*NL*
door
without
waiting
for
Grushenka
's
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
looked
at
him
from
the
side
without
stirring
.
The
old
man
's
profile
*NL*
that
he
loathed
so
,
his
pendent
Adam
's
apple
,
his
hooked
nose
,
his
lips
*NL*
that
smiled
in
greedy
expectation
,
were
all
brightly
lighted
up
by
the
*NL*
slanting
lamplight
falling
on
the
left
from
the
room
.
A
horrible
fury
of
*NL*
hatred
suddenly
surged
up
in
Mitya
's
heart
:
``
There
he
was
,
his
rival
,
the
*NL*
man
who
had
tormented
him
,
had
ruined
his
life
!
''
It
was
a
rush
of
that
*NL*
sudden
,
furious
,
revengeful
anger
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
as
though
*NL*
foreseeing
it
,
to
Alyosha
,
four
days
ago
in
the
arbor
,
when
,
in
answer
to
*NL*
Alyosha
's
question
,
``
How
can
you
say
you
'll
kill
our
father
?
''
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
had
said
then
.
``
Perhaps
I
shall
not
kill
him
,
*NL*
perhaps
I
shall
.
I
'm
afraid
he
'll
suddenly
be
so
loathsome
to
me
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
I
hate
his
double
chin
,
his
nose
,
his
eyes
,
his
shameless
grin
.
I
*NL*
feel
a
personal
repulsion
.
That
's
what
I
'm
afraid
of
,
that
's
what
may
be
*NL*
too
much
for
me
.
''
...
This
personal
repulsion
was
growing
unendurable
.
*NL*
Mitya
was
beside
himself
,
he
suddenly
pulled
the
brass
pestle
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
-------------------------------------
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
was
watching
over
me
then
,
''
Mitya
himself
said
afterwards
.
At
that
*NL*
very
moment
Grigory
waked
up
on
his
bed
of
sickness
.
Earlier
in
the
*NL*
evening
he
had
undergone
the
treatment
which
Smerdyakov
had
described
to
*NL*
Ivan
.
He
had
rubbed
himself
all
over
with
vodka
mixed
with
a
secret
,
very
*NL*
strong
decoction
,
had
drunk
what
was
left
of
the
mixture
while
his
wife
*NL*
repeated
a
``
certain
prayer
''
over
him
,
after
which
he
had
gone
to
bed
.
*NL*
Marfa
Ignatyevna
had
tasted
the
stuff
,
too
,
and
,
being
unused
to
strong
*NL*
drink
,
slept
like
the
dead
beside
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Grigory
waked
up
in
the
night
,
quite
suddenly
,
and
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
reflection
,
though
he
immediately
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
back
,
he
sat
up
*NL*
in
bed
.
Then
he
deliberated
again
,
got
up
and
dressed
hurriedly
.
Perhaps
*NL*
his
conscience
was
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
sleeping
while
the
house
was
*NL*
unguarded
``
in
such
perilous
times
.
''
Smerdyakov
,
exhausted
by
his
fit
,
lay
*NL*
motionless
in
the
next
room
.
Marfa
Ignatyevna
did
not
stir
.
``
The
stuff
's
*NL*
been
too
much
for
the
woman
,
''
Grigory
thought
,
glancing
at
her
,
and
*NL*
groaning
,
he
went
out
on
the
steps
.
No
doubt
he
only
intended
to
look
out
*NL*
from
the
steps
,
for
he
was
hardly
able
to
walk
,
the
pain
in
his
back
and
*NL*
his
right
leg
was
intolerable
.
But
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
not
*NL*
locked
the
little
gate
into
the
garden
that
evening
.
He
was
the
most
*NL*
punctual
and
precise
of
men
,
a
man
who
adhered
to
an
unchangeable
routine
,
*NL*
and
habits
that
lasted
for
years
.
Limping
and
writhing
with
pain
he
went
*NL*
down
the
steps
and
towards
the
garden
.
Yes
,
the
gate
stood
wide
open
.
*NL*
Mechanically
he
stepped
into
the
garden
.
Perhaps
he
fancied
something
,
*NL*
perhaps
caught
some
sound
,
and
,
glancing
to
the
left
he
saw
his
master
's
*NL*
window
open
.
No
one
was
looking
out
of
it
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
it
open
for
?
It
's
not
summer
now
,
''
thought
Grigory
,
and
suddenly
,
*NL*
at
that
very
instant
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
extraordinary
before
*NL*
him
in
the
garden
.
Forty
paces
in
front
of
him
a
man
seemed
to
be
running
*NL*
in
the
dark
,
a
sort
of
shadow
was
moving
very
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
''
cried
Grigory
beside
himself
,
and
forgetting
the
pain
in
his
*NL*
back
,
he
hurried
to
intercept
the
running
figure
.
He
took
a
short
cut
,
*NL*
evidently
he
knew
the
garden
better
;
the
flying
figure
went
towards
the
*NL*
bath-house
,
ran
behind
it
and
rushed
to
the
garden
fence
.
Grigory
*NL*
followed
,
not
losing
sight
of
him
,
and
ran
,
forgetting
everything
.
He
*NL*
reached
the
fence
at
the
very
moment
the
man
was
climbing
over
it
.
Grigory
*NL*
cried
out
,
beside
himself
,
pounced
on
him
,
and
clutched
his
leg
in
his
two
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
his
foreboding
had
not
deceived
him
.
He
recognized
him
,
it
was
he
,
*NL*
the
``
monster
,
''
the
``
parricide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parricide
!
''
the
old
man
shouted
so
that
the
whole
neighborhood
could
*NL*
hear
,
but
he
had
not
time
to
shout
more
,
he
fell
at
once
,
as
though
struck
*NL*
by
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
jumped
back
into
the
garden
and
bent
over
the
fallen
man
.
In
Mitya
's
*NL*
hands
was
a
brass
pestle
,
and
he
flung
it
mechanically
in
the
grass
.
The
*NL*
pestle
fell
two
paces
from
Grigory
,
not
in
the
grass
but
on
the
path
,
in
a
*NL*
most
conspicuous
place
.
For
some
seconds
he
examined
the
prostrate
figure
*NL*
before
him
.
The
old
man
's
head
was
covered
with
blood
.
Mitya
put
out
his
*NL*
hand
and
began
feeling
it
.
He
remembered
afterwards
clearly
,
that
he
had
*NL*
been
awfully
anxious
to
make
sure
whether
he
had
broken
the
old
man
's
*NL*
skull
,
or
simply
stunned
him
with
the
pestle
.
But
the
blood
was
flowing
*NL*
horribly
;
and
in
a
moment
Mitya
's
fingers
were
drenched
with
the
hot
*NL*
stream
.
He
remembered
taking
out
of
his
pocket
the
clean
white
*NL*
handkerchief
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
for
his
visit
to
Madame
*NL*
Hohlakov
,
and
putting
it
to
the
old
man
's
head
,
senselessly
trying
to
wipe
*NL*
the
blood
from
his
face
and
temples
.
But
the
handkerchief
was
instantly
*NL*
soaked
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
what
am
I
doing
it
for
?
''
thought
Mitya
,
suddenly
pulling
*NL*
himself
together
.
``
If
I
have
broken
his
skull
,
how
can
I
find
out
now
?
And
*NL*
what
difference
does
it
make
now
?
''
he
added
,
hopelessly
.
``
If
I
've
killed
*NL*
him
,
I
've
killed
him
...
You
've
come
to
grief
,
old
man
,
so
there
you
must
*NL*
lie
!
''
he
said
aloud
.
And
suddenly
turning
to
the
fence
,
he
vaulted
over
it
*NL*
into
the
lane
and
fell
to
running
--
the
handkerchief
soaked
with
blood
he
*NL*
held
,
crushed
up
in
his
right
fist
,
and
as
he
ran
he
thrust
it
into
the
*NL*
back
pocket
of
his
coat
.
He
ran
headlong
,
and
the
few
passers-by
who
met
*NL*
him
in
the
dark
,
in
the
streets
,
remembered
afterwards
that
they
had
met
a
*NL*
man
running
that
night
.
He
flew
back
again
to
the
widow
Morozov
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
he
had
left
it
that
evening
,
Fenya
had
rushed
to
the
*NL*
chief
porter
,
Nazar
Ivanovitch
,
and
besought
him
,
for
Christ
's
sake
,
``
not
*NL*
to
let
the
captain
in
again
to-day
or
to-morrow
.
''
Nazar
Ivanovitch
*NL*
promised
,
but
went
upstairs
to
his
mistress
who
had
suddenly
sent
for
him
,
*NL*
and
meeting
his
nephew
,
a
boy
of
twenty
,
who
had
recently
come
from
the
*NL*
country
,
on
the
way
up
told
him
to
take
his
place
,
but
forgot
to
mention
*NL*
``
the
captain
.
''
Mitya
,
running
up
to
the
gate
,
knocked
.
The
lad
instantly
*NL*
recognized
him
,
for
Mitya
had
more
than
once
tipped
him
.
Opening
the
gate
*NL*
at
once
,
he
let
him
in
,
and
hastened
to
inform
him
with
a
good-humored
*NL*
smile
that
``
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
is
not
at
home
now
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
then
,
Prohor
?
''
asked
Mitya
,
stopping
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
set
off
this
evening
,
some
two
hours
ago
,
with
Timofey
,
to
Mokroe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
cried
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
ca
n't
say
.
To
see
some
officer
.
Some
one
invited
her
and
horses
*NL*
were
sent
to
fetch
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
left
him
,
and
ran
like
a
madman
to
Fenya
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
V
.
A
Sudden
Resolution
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
with
her
grandmother
;
they
were
both
just
*NL*
going
to
bed
.
Relying
on
Nazar
Ivanovitch
,
they
had
not
locked
themselves
*NL*
in
.
Mitya
ran
in
,
pounced
on
Fenya
and
seized
her
by
the
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
at
once
!
Where
is
she
?
With
whom
is
she
now
,
at
Mokroe
?
''
he
roared
*NL*
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
women
squealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aie
!
I
'll
tell
you
.
Aie
!
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
darling
,
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
everything
directly
,
I
wo
n't
hide
anything
,
''
gabbled
Fenya
,
frightened
to
*NL*
death
;
``
she
's
gone
to
Mokroe
,
to
her
officer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
officer
?
''
roared
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
her
officer
,
the
same
one
she
used
to
know
,
the
one
who
threw
her
over
*NL*
five
years
ago
,
''
cackled
Fenya
,
as
fast
as
she
could
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
withdrew
the
hands
with
which
he
was
squeezing
her
throat
.
He
stood
*NL*
facing
her
,
pale
as
death
,
unable
to
utter
a
word
,
but
his
eyes
showed
*NL*
that
he
realized
it
all
,
all
,
from
the
first
word
,
and
guessed
the
whole
*NL*
position
.
Poor
Fenya
was
not
in
a
condition
at
that
moment
to
observe
*NL*
whether
he
understood
or
not
.
She
remained
sitting
on
the
trunk
as
she
had
*NL*
been
when
he
ran
into
the
room
,
trembling
all
over
,
holding
her
hands
out
*NL*
before
her
as
though
trying
to
defend
herself
.
She
seemed
to
have
grown
*NL*
rigid
in
that
position
.
Her
wide-opened
,
scared
eyes
were
fixed
immovably
*NL*
upon
him
.
And
to
make
matters
worse
,
both
his
hands
were
smeared
with
*NL*
blood
.
On
the
way
,
as
he
ran
,
he
must
have
touched
his
forehead
with
them
,
*NL*
wiping
off
the
perspiration
,
so
that
on
his
forehead
and
his
right
cheek
*NL*
were
blood-stained
patches
.
Fenya
was
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
.
The
old
*NL*
cook
had
jumped
up
and
was
staring
at
him
like
a
mad
woman
,
almost
*NL*
unconscious
with
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
stood
for
a
moment
,
then
mechanically
sank
on
to
a
chair
next
to
*NL*
Fenya
.
He
sat
,
not
reflecting
but
,
as
it
were
,
terror-stricken
,
benumbed
.
*NL*
Yet
everything
was
clear
as
day
:
that
officer
,
he
knew
about
him
,
he
knew
*NL*
everything
perfectly
,
he
had
known
it
from
Grushenka
herself
,
had
known
*NL*
that
a
letter
had
come
from
him
a
month
before
.
So
that
for
a
month
,
for
a
*NL*
whole
month
,
this
had
been
going
on
,
a
secret
from
him
,
till
the
very
*NL*
arrival
of
this
new
man
,
and
he
had
never
thought
of
him
!
But
how
could
*NL*
he
,
how
could
he
not
have
thought
of
him
?
Why
was
it
he
had
forgotten
this
*NL*
officer
,
like
that
,
forgotten
him
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
him
?
That
was
the
*NL*
question
that
faced
him
like
some
monstrous
thing
.
And
he
looked
at
this
*NL*
monstrous
thing
with
horror
,
growing
cold
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
,
as
gently
and
mildly
as
a
gentle
and
affectionate
child
,
he
*NL*
began
speaking
to
Fenya
as
though
he
had
utterly
forgotten
how
he
had
*NL*
scared
and
hurt
her
just
now
.
He
fell
to
questioning
Fenya
with
an
extreme
*NL*
preciseness
,
astonishing
in
his
position
,
and
though
the
girl
looked
*NL*
wildly
at
his
blood-stained
hands
,
she
,
too
,
with
wonderful
readiness
and
*NL*
rapidity
,
answered
every
question
as
though
eager
to
put
the
whole
truth
*NL*
and
nothing
but
the
truth
before
him
.
Little
by
little
,
even
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
enjoyment
,
she
began
explaining
every
detail
,
not
wanting
to
torment
*NL*
him
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
eager
to
be
of
the
utmost
service
to
him
.
She
*NL*
described
the
whole
of
that
day
,
in
great
detail
,
the
visit
of
Rakitin
and
*NL*
Alyosha
,
how
she
,
Fenya
,
had
stood
on
the
watch
,
how
the
mistress
had
set
*NL*
off
,
and
how
she
had
called
out
of
the
window
to
Alyosha
to
give
him
,
*NL*
Mitya
,
her
greetings
,
and
to
tell
him
``
to
remember
for
ever
how
she
had
*NL*
loved
him
for
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
of
the
message
,
Mitya
suddenly
smiled
,
and
there
was
a
flush
of
*NL*
color
on
his
pale
cheeks
.
At
the
same
moment
Fenya
said
to
him
,
not
a
bit
*NL*
afraid
now
to
be
inquisitive
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
your
hands
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
They
're
all
over
blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mitya
mechanically
.
He
looked
carelessly
at
his
hands
and
*NL*
at
once
forgot
them
and
Fenya
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sank
into
silence
again
.
Twenty
minutes
had
passed
since
he
had
run
in
.
*NL*
His
first
horror
was
over
,
but
evidently
some
new
fixed
determination
had
*NL*
taken
possession
of
him
.
He
suddenly
stood
up
,
smiling
dreamily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
to
you
,
sir
?
''
said
Fenya
,
pointing
to
his
hands
again
.
*NL*
She
spoke
compassionately
,
as
though
she
felt
very
near
to
him
now
in
his
*NL*
grief
.
Mitya
looked
at
his
hands
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
blood
,
Fenya
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
with
a
strange
expression
.
*NL*
``
That
's
human
blood
,
and
my
God
!
why
was
it
shed
?
But
...
Fenya
...
*NL*
there
's
a
fence
here
''
-LRB-
he
looked
at
her
as
though
setting
her
a
riddle
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
a
high
fence
,
and
terrible
to
look
at
.
But
at
dawn
to-morrow
,
when
the
*NL*
sun
rises
,
Mitya
will
leap
over
that
fence
...
You
do
n't
understand
what
*NL*
fence
,
Fenya
,
and
,
never
mind
...
You
'll
hear
to-morrow
and
understand
...
*NL*
and
now
,
good-by
.
I
wo
n't
stand
in
her
way
.
I
'll
step
aside
,
I
know
how
to
*NL*
step
aside
.
Live
,
my
joy
...
You
loved
me
for
an
hour
,
remember
Mityenka
*NL*
Karamazov
so
for
ever
...
She
always
used
to
call
me
Mityenka
,
do
you
*NL*
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
those
words
he
went
suddenly
out
of
the
kitchen
.
Fenya
was
almost
*NL*
more
frightened
at
this
sudden
departure
than
she
had
been
when
he
ran
in
*NL*
and
attacked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
ten
minutes
later
Dmitri
went
in
to
Pyotr
Ilyitch
Perhotin
,
the
young
*NL*
official
with
whom
he
had
pawned
his
pistols
.
It
was
by
now
half-past
*NL*
eight
,
and
Pyotr
Ilyitch
had
finished
his
evening
tea
,
and
had
just
put
*NL*
his
coat
on
again
to
go
to
the
``
Metropolis
''
to
play
billiards
.
Mitya
*NL*
caught
him
coming
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
him
with
his
face
all
smeared
with
blood
,
the
young
man
uttered
a
*NL*
cry
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
for
my
pistols
,
''
said
Mitya
,
``
and
brought
you
the
money
.
And
*NL*
thanks
very
much
.
I
'm
in
a
hurry
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
please
make
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
grew
more
and
more
surprised
;
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
*NL*
bundle
of
bank-notes
in
Mitya
's
hand
,
and
what
was
more
,
he
had
walked
in
*NL*
holding
the
notes
as
no
one
walks
in
and
no
one
carries
money
:
he
had
them
*NL*
in
his
right
hand
,
and
held
them
outstretched
as
if
to
show
them
.
*NL*
Perhotin
's
servant-boy
,
who
met
Mitya
in
the
passage
,
said
afterwards
that
*NL*
he
walked
into
the
passage
in
the
same
way
,
with
the
money
outstretched
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
so
he
must
have
been
carrying
them
like
that
even
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
They
were
all
rainbow-colored
hundred-rouble
notes
,
and
the
*NL*
fingers
holding
them
were
covered
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
questioned
later
on
as
to
the
sum
of
money
,
he
said
*NL*
that
it
was
difficult
to
judge
at
a
glance
,
but
that
it
might
have
been
*NL*
two
thousand
,
or
perhaps
three
,
but
it
was
a
big
,
``
fat
''
bundle
.
``
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
''
so
he
testified
afterwards
,
``
seemed
unlike
himself
,
too
;
*NL*
not
drunk
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
exalted
,
lost
to
everything
,
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
as
it
were
,
absorbed
,
as
though
pondering
and
searching
for
*NL*
something
and
unable
to
come
to
a
decision
.
He
was
in
great
haste
,
*NL*
answered
abruptly
and
very
strangely
,
and
at
moments
seemed
not
at
all
*NL*
dejected
but
quite
cheerful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
_
is
_
the
matter
with
you
?
What
's
wrong
?
''
cried
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
*NL*
looking
wildly
at
his
guest
.
``
How
is
it
that
you
're
all
covered
with
*NL*
blood
?
Have
you
had
a
fall
?
Look
at
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
him
by
the
elbow
and
led
him
to
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
his
blood-stained
face
,
Mitya
started
and
scowled
wrathfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damnation
!
That
's
the
last
straw
,
''
he
muttered
angrily
,
hurriedly
*NL*
changing
the
notes
from
his
right
hand
to
the
left
,
and
impulsively
jerked
*NL*
the
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
.
But
the
handkerchief
turned
out
to
be
*NL*
soaked
with
blood
,
too
-LRB-
it
was
the
handkerchief
he
had
used
to
wipe
*NL*
Grigory
's
face
-RRB-
.
There
was
scarcely
a
white
spot
on
it
,
and
it
had
not
*NL*
merely
begun
to
dry
,
but
had
stiffened
into
a
crumpled
ball
and
could
not
*NL*
be
pulled
apart
.
Mitya
threw
it
angrily
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
damn
it
!
''
he
said
.
``
Have
n't
you
a
rag
of
some
sort
...
to
wipe
my
*NL*
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
're
only
stained
,
not
wounded
?
You
'd
better
wash

''
said
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
.
``
Here
's
a
wash-stand
.
I
'll
pour
you
out
some
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wash-stand
?
That
's
all
right
...
but
where
am
I
to
put
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
strangest
perplexity
he
indicated
his
bundle
of
hundred-rouble
*NL*
notes
,
looking
inquiringly
at
Pyotr
Ilyitch
as
though
it
were
for
him
to
*NL*
decide
what
he
,
Mitya
,
was
to
do
with
his
own
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
your
pocket
,
or
on
the
table
here
.
They
wo
n't
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
pocket
?
Yes
,
in
my
pocket
.
All
right
...
But
,
I
say
,
that
's
all
*NL*
nonsense
,
''
he
cried
,
as
though
suddenly
coming
out
of
his
absorption
.
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
let
's
first
settle
that
business
of
the
pistols
.
Give
them
*NL*
back
to
me

Here
's
your
money
...
because
I
am
in
great
need
of
them
...
*NL*
and
I
have
n't
a
minute
,
a
minute
to
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
the
topmost
note
from
the
bundle
he
held
it
out
to
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
sha
n't
have
change
enough
.
Have
n't
you
less
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mitya
,
looking
again
at
the
bundle
,
and
as
though
not
trusting
*NL*
his
own
words
he
turned
over
two
or
three
of
the
topmost
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
're
all
alike

he
added
,
and
again
he
looked
inquiringly
at
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
you
grown
so
rich
?
''
the
latter
asked
.
``
Wait

I
'll
send
my

close
late

*NL*
he
called
into
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Plotnikov

first-rate

cried
Mitya
,
as
though
struck
by
an
*NL*
idea
.
``
Misha

he
turned
to
the
boy
as
he
came
in
,
``

champagne

three
dozen
bottles

ready
before
I
come

and
packed
as
it
was
*NL*
to
take

Mokroe

I
took
four
dozen

he
added
-LRB-
suddenly
*NL*
addressing
Pyotr
Ilyitch
-RRB-
;
``
they
know
all
about
it
,
do
n't
you
trouble
,
*NL*
Misha

he
turned
again
to
the
boy
.
``
Stay

tell

Strasburg

caviare

and
everything

*NL*
everything

up

do

just
the

again

if
you
are
called

His
name
is

Misha

is

He
turned
to
Pyotr
Ilyitch
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
Protr
Ilyitch
intervened
,
listening
and
watching
him
*NL*
uneasily
,
``
you
'd
better
go
yourself
and
tell
them

He
'll
muddle
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will

I

was
going

the

commission

there
's
ten
roubles

Champagne
's
the
chief
thing

bring
up
*NL*
champagne

And
brandy

too

and
red
and
white
wine

all
I
had
then

*NL*
They
know
what
I
had
then

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
listen
!
''
Pyotr
Ilyitch
interrupted
with
some
impatience
.
``
I
say
,
let
*NL*
him
simply
run
and
change
the
money
and
tell
them
not
to
close

go
*NL*
and
tell
them

Give
him
your
note

Be
off
,
Misha

Put
your
best
leg
*NL*
forward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
seemed
to
hurry
Misha
off
on
purpose
,
because
the
boy
*NL*
remained
standing
with
his
mouth
and
eyes
wide
open
,
apparently
*NL*
understanding
little
of
Mitya
's
orders
,
gazing
up
with
amazement
and
*NL*
terror
at
his
blood-stained
face
and
the
trembling
bloodstained
fingers
*NL*
that
held
the
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
come
and
wash
,
''
said
Pyotr
Ilyitch
sternly
.
``
Put
the
money
on
*NL*
the
table

else
in
your
pocket

That
's
right
,
come
along

But
take
*NL*
off
your
coat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
beginning
to
help
him
off
with
his
coat
,
he
cried
out
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
your
coat
's
covered
with
blood
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

it
's
not
the
coat

It
's
only
a
little
here
on
the
sleeve
...
And
*NL*
that
's
only
here
where
the
handkerchief
lay
.
It
must
have
soaked
through
.
*NL*
I
must
have
sat
on
the
handkerchief
at
Fenya
's
,
and
the
blood
's
come
*NL*
through
,
''
Mitya
explained
at
once
with
a
childlike
unconsciousness
that
*NL*
was
astounding
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
listened
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
have
been
up
to
something
;
you
must
have
been
fighting
*NL*
with
some
one

he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
wash
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
held
the
jug
and
poured
out
the
water
.
*NL*
Mitya
,
in
desperate
haste
,
scarcely
soaped
his
hands
-LRB-
they
were
trembling
,
*NL*
and
Pyotr
Ilyitch
remembered
it
afterwards
-RRB-
.
But
the
young
official
*NL*
insisted
on
his
soaping
them
thoroughly
and
rubbing
them
more
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
exercise
more
and
more
sway
over
Mitya
,
as
time
went
on
.
It
may
be
*NL*
noted
in
passing
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
sturdy
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
you
have
n't
got
your
nails
clean

Now
rub
your
face
;
here
,
on
your
*NL*
temples
,
by
your
ear
...
Will
you
go
in
that
shirt
?
Where
are
you
going
?
*NL*
Look
,
all
the
cuff
of
your
right
sleeve
is
covered
with
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
bloody

observed
Mitya
,
looking
at
the
cuff
of
his
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
change
your
shirt

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
time

You
see

''
Mitya
went
on
with
the
same
confiding
*NL*
ingenuousness
,
drying
his
face
and
hands
on
the
towel
,
and
putting
on
his
*NL*
coat
.
``
I
'll
turn
it
up
at
the
wrist

It
wo
n't
be
seen
under
the
coat

You
see
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
now

what
game
have
you
been
up
to

Have
you
been
fighting
with

some

In
the
tavern
again

as
before

Have
you
been
beating
that

captain
again

Pyotr
Ilyitch
asked
him
reproachfully
.
``
Whom
have
you
been
*NL*
beating
now
...
or
killing

perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mitya

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

said
Mitya
,
and
he
suddenly
laughed
.

I
smashed
an
old
*NL*
woman
in
the
market-place
just
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Smashed

An

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Mitya
,
looking
Pyotr
Ilyitch
straight
in
the
face
,
*NL*
laughing
,
and
shouting
at
him
as
though
he
were
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
it

An

an
old
man

Have
you
killed
some
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
made

up

up

suddenly
winked

snapped
out

resolutely

of

at

off

roar

laughter

and
*NL*
carefully
sprinkled
and
rammed
in

charge

Then
he
took
the
bullet
and
,
*NL*
before
inserting
it
,
held
it
in
two
fingers
in
front
of
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
looking
at

bullet

asked
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
watching
him
*NL*
with
uneasy
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
fancy

Why

if
you
meant

put
that
bullet
in

you
look
at

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

going

But

done

''
he
*NL*
added
,
putting
in
the
bullet
and
driving
it
home
with
the
ramrod
.
``
Pyotr

Ilyitch

And
taking
a
pen
from
the
table

Mitya
rapidly
wrote
two
lines
,
folded
the
*NL*
paper
in
four
,
and
thrust
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket

He
put
the
pistols
*NL*
in
the
case

locked
it
up
,
and
kept
it
in
his
hand

Then
he
looked
at

a
slow

thoughtful
smile

Pyotr

asked
uneasily

took

In

after

*NL*
*NL*
Plotnikov
's
shop
was
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
next
door
but
one
to
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
's
.
It
was
the
largest
grocery
shop
in
our
town
,
and
by
no
*NL*
means
a
bad
one
,
belonging
to
some
rich
merchants
.
They
kept
everything
*NL*
that
could
be
got
in
a
Petersburg
shop
,
grocery
of
all
sort
,
wines
*NL*
``
bottled
by
the
brothers
Eliseyev
,
''
fruits
,
cigars
,
tea
,
coffee
,
sugar
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
There
were
three
shop-assistants
and
two
errand
boys
always
*NL*
employed
.
Though
our
part
of
the
country
had
grown
poorer
,
the
landowners
*NL*
had
gone
away
,
and
trade
had
got
worse
,
yet
the
grocery
stores
flourished
*NL*
as
before
,
every
year
with
increasing
prosperity
;
there
were
plenty
of
*NL*
purchasers
for
their
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
awaiting
Mitya
with
impatience
in
the
shop
.
They
had
vivid
*NL*
recollections
of
how
he
had
bought
,
three
or
four
weeks
ago
,
wine
and
*NL*
goods
of
all
sorts
to
the
value
of
several
hundred
roubles
,
paid
for
in
*NL*
cash
-LRB-
they
would
never
have
let
him
have
anything
on
credit
,
of
course
-RRB-
.
*NL*
They
remembered
that
then
,
as
now
,
he
had
had
a
bundle
of
hundred-rouble
*NL*
notes
in
his
hand
,
and
had
scattered
them
at
random
,
without
bargaining
,
*NL*
without
reflecting
,
or
caring
to
reflect
what
use
so
much
wine
and
*NL*
provisions
would
be
to
him
.
The
story
was
told
all
over
the
town
that
,
*NL*
driving
off
then
with
Grushenka
to
Mokroe
,
he
had
``
spent
three
thousand
in
*NL*
one
night
and
the
following
day
,
and
had
come
back
from
the
spree
without
*NL*
a
penny
.
''
He
had
picked
up
a
whole
troop
of
gypsies
-LRB-
encamped
in
our
*NL*
neighborhood
at
the
time
-RRB-
,
who
for
two
days
got
money
without
stint
out
of
*NL*
him
while
he
was
drunk
,
and
drank
expensive
wine
without
stint
.
People
*NL*
used
to
tell
,
laughing
at
Mitya
,
how
he
had
given
champagne
to
grimy
-
*NL*
handed
peasants
,
and
feasted
the
village
women
and
girls
on
sweets
and
*NL*
Strasburg
pies
.
Though
to
laugh
at
Mitya
to
his
face
was
rather
a
risky
*NL*
proceeding
,
there
was
much
laughter
behind
his
back
,
especially
in
the
*NL*
tavern
,
at
his
own
ingenuous
public
avowal
that
all
he
had
got
out
of
*NL*
Grushenka
by
this
``
escapade
''
was
``
permission
to
kiss
her
foot
,
and
that
*NL*
was
the
utmost
she
had
allowed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Mitya
and
Pyotr
Ilyitch
reached
the
shop
,
they
found
a
cart
*NL*
with
three
horses
harnessed
abreast
with
bells
,
and
with
Andrey
,
the
*NL*
driver
,
ready
waiting
for
Mitya
at
the
entrance
.
In
the
shop
they
had
*NL*
almost
entirely
finished
packing
one
box
of
provisions
,
and
were
only
*NL*
waiting
for
Mitya
's
arrival
to
nail
it
down
and
put
it
in
the
cart
.
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
was
astounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
this
cart
come
from
in
such
a
hurry
?
''
he
asked
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
Andrey
as
I
ran
to
you
,
and
told
him
to
drive
straight
here
to
the
*NL*
shop

There
's
no
time
to
lose
.
Last
time
I
drove
with
Timofey
,
but
Timofey
*NL*
now
has
gone
on
before
me
with
the
witch

Shall
we
be
very
late

Andrey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
only
get
there
an
hour
at
most
before

not
even
that

Timofey
ready
to
start

I
know
how
he
'll
go

Their

*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
How
could
it
be
?
They
wo

there

Andrey
,
a
lanky
,
red-haired
,
middle-aged
driver
,
wearing
a
full
-
*NL*
skirted
coat
,
and
with
a
kaftan
on
his
arm
,
replied
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
roubles
for
vodka
if
we
're
only
an
hour
behind
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warrant
the
time

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

Ech

they
wo

be
half
an
hour
*NL*
before
us
,
let
alone
an
hour

''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mitya
bustled
about
seeing
after
things
,
he
gave
his
orders
*NL*
strangely
,
as
it
were
disconnectedly
,
and
inconsecutively
.
He
began
a
*NL*
sentence
and
forgot
the
end
of
it
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
found
himself
obliged
to
*NL*
come
to
the
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
hundred
roubles
'
worth
,
not
less
than
four
hundred
roubles
'
worth
,
*NL*
just
as
it
was
then
,
''
commanded
Mitya
.
``
Four
dozen
champagne
,
not
a
bottle
*NL*
less

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
with
so
much
?
What
's
it
for
?
Stay
!
''
cried
Pyotr
Ilyitch
.
*NL*
``
What
's
this
box
?
What
's
in
it
?
Surely
there
is
n't
four
hundred
roubles
'
*NL*
worth
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officious
shopmen
began
explaining
with
oily
politeness
that
the
first
*NL*
box
contained
only
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
champagne
,
and
only
``
the
most
*NL*
indispensable
articles
,
''
such
as
savories
,
sweets
,
toffee
,
etc.
.
But
the
*NL*
main
part
of
the
goods
ordered
would
be
packed
and
sent
off
,
as
on
the
*NL*
previous
occasion
,
in
a
special
cart
also
with
three
horses
traveling
at
*NL*
full
speed
,
so
that
it
would
arrive
not
more
than
an
hour
later
than
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
an
hour
!
Not
more
than
an
hour

And
put
in
more
toffee
and
*NL*
fondants
.
The
girls
there
are
so
fond
of
it
,
''
Mitya
insisted
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fondants
are
all
right
.
But
what
do
you
want
with
four
dozen
of
*NL*
champagne
?
One
would
be
enough
,
''
said
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
almost
angry
.
He
*NL*
began
bargaining
,
asking
for
a
bill
of
the
goods
,
and
refused
to
be
*NL*
satisfied
.
But
he
only
succeeded
in
saving
a
hundred
roubles
.
In
the
end
*NL*
it
was
agreed
that
only
three
hundred
roubles
'
worth
should
be
sent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
may
go
to
the
devil
!

cried
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
on
second
thoughts
.
*NL*
``
What
's
it
to
do
with

Throw
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

Mitya
drew
him
into
a
*NL*
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
.
``
They
'll
give
us
a

Mitya
sat
down
on
a
wicker
chair
,
before
a
little
table
,
covered
with
a
*NL*
dirty
dinner-napkin
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
sat
down
opposite
,
and
the
champagne
*NL*
soon
appeared
,
and
oysters
were
suggested
to
the
gentlemen
.
``

almost
angrily

said
suddenly

with
feeling

picked
out
three

threw

out

Andrey

coughing
from

brandy

jumped

ran
up

clasped

plumped
down

whipped
up
the

but
he
keeps

Pyotr
Ilyitch
*NL*
thought
as
he
watched
him
go
.
He
had
half
a
mind
to
stay
and
see
the
cart
*NL*
packed
with
the
remaining
wines
and
provisions
,
knowing
that
they
would
*NL*
deceive
and
defraud
Mitya
.
But
,
suddenly
feeling
vexed
with
himself
,
he
*NL*
turned
away
with
a
curse
and
went
to
the
tavern
to
play
billiards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
fool
,
though
he
's
a

he
muttered
as
he
went
.
``
I

heard
of

*NL*
up

Ech

Besides

it
'll

brawlers

fight

shouted

such
phrases
a
thousand
times

drunk

in
the
taverns

But
now
he
's
not

find
out

*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
tavern
in
a
bad
humor
and
at
once
made
up
a
game
.
The
game
*NL*
cheered
him
.
He
played
a
second
game
,
and
suddenly
began
telling
one
of
*NL*
his
partners
that
Dmitri
Karamazov
had
come
in
for
some
cash
*NL*
again
--
something
like
three
thousand
roubles
,
and
had
gone
to
Mokroe
again
*NL*
to
spend
it
with
Grushenka
...
This
news
roused
singular
interest
in
his
*NL*
listeners
.
They
all
spoke
of
it
,
not
laughing
,
but
with
a
strange
gravity
.
*NL*
They
left
off
playing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
thousand
?
But
where
can
he
have
got
three
thousand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Questions
were
asked
.
The
story
of
Madame
Hohlakov
's
present
was
received
*NL*
with
skepticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
he
robbed
his
old
father

that
's
the
question

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
thousand

There
's
something
odd
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
boasted
aloud
that
he
would
kill
his
father
;
we
all
heard
him
,
here

*NL*
And
it
was
three
thousand
he
talked
about
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
listened
.
All
at
once
he
became
short
and
dry
in
his
*NL*
answers
.
He
said
not
a
word
about
the
blood
on
Mitya
's
face
and
hands
,
*NL*
though
he
had
meant
to
speak
of
it
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
a
third
game
,
and
by
degrees
the
talk
about
Mitya
died
away
.
*NL*
But
by
the
end
of
the
third
game
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
felt
no
more
desire
for
*NL*
billiards
;
he
laid
down
the
cue
,
and
without
having
supper
as
he
had
*NL*
intended
,
he
walked
out
of
the
tavern
.
When
he
reached
the
market-place
he
*NL*
stood
still
in
perplexity
,
wondering
at
himself
.
He
realized
that
what
he
*NL*
wanted
was
to
go
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
and
find
out
if
anything
had
*NL*
happened
there
.
``
On
account
of
some
stupid
nonsense
--
as
it
's
sure
to
turn
*NL*
out
--
am
I
going
to
wake
up
the
household
and
make
a
scandal
?
Fooh
!
damn
it
,
*NL*
is
it
my
business
to
look
after
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
bad
humor
he
went
straight
home
,
and
suddenly
remembered
Fenya
.
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
!
I
ought
to
have
questioned
her
just
now
,
''
he
thought
with
*NL*
vexation
,
``
I
should
have
heard
everything
.
''
And
the
desire
to
speak
to
*NL*
her
,
and
so
find
out
,
became
so
pressing
and
importunate
that
when
he
was
*NL*
half-way
home
he
turned
abruptly
and
went
towards
the
house
where
*NL*
Grushenka
lodged
.
Going
up
to
the
gate
he
knocked
.
The
sound
of
the
knock
*NL*
in
the
silence
of
the
night
sobered
him
and
made
him
feel
annoyed
.
And
no
*NL*
one
answered
him
;
every
one
in
the
house
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
shall
be
making
a
fuss
!
''
he
thought
,
with
a
feeling
of
positive
*NL*
discomfort
.
But
instead
of
going
away
altogether
,
he
fell
to
knocking
*NL*
again
with
all
his
might
,
filling
the
street
with
clamor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
coming
?
Well
,
I
will
knock
them
up
,
I
will
!
''
he
muttered
at
each
*NL*
knock
,
fuming
at
himself
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
redoubled
his
knocks
on
*NL*
the
gate

But
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
was
speeding
along
the
road
.
It
was
a
little
more
*NL*
than
twenty
versts
to
Mokroe
,
but
Andrey
's
three
horses
galloped
at
such
a
*NL*
pace
that
the
distance
might
be
covered
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
.
The
*NL*
swift
motion
revived
Mitya
.
The
air
was
fresh
and
cool
,
there
were
big
*NL*
stars
shining
in
the
sky
.
It
was
the
very
night
,
and
perhaps
the
very
*NL*
hour
,
in
which
Alyosha
fell
on
the
earth
,
and
rapturously
swore
to
love
it
*NL*
for
ever
and
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
confusion
,
confusion
,
in
Mitya
's
soul
,
but
although
many
things
*NL*
were
goading
his
heart
,
at
that
moment
his
whole
being
was
yearning
for
*NL*
her
,
his
queen
,
to
whom
he
was
flying
to
look
on
her
for
the
last
time
.
*NL*
One
thing
I
can
say
for
certain
;
his
heart
did
not
waver
for
one
instant
.
*NL*
I
shall
perhaps
not
be
believed
when
I
say
that
this
jealous
lover
felt
*NL*
not
the
slightest
jealousy
of
this
new
rival
,
who
seemed
to
have
sprung
*NL*
out
of
the
earth
.
If
any
other
had
appeared
on
the
scene
,
he
would
have
*NL*
been
jealous
at
once
,
and
would
perhaps
have
stained
his
fierce
hands
with
*NL*
blood
again
.
But
as
he
flew
through
the
night
,
he
felt
no
envy
,
no
*NL*
hostility
even
,
for
the
man
who
had
been
her
first
lover
...
It
is
true
he
*NL*
had
not
yet
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
there
was
no
room
for
dispute
:
it
was
her
right
and
his
;
this
was
*NL*
her
first
love
which
,
after
five
years
,
she
had
not
forgotten
;
so
she
had
*NL*
loved
him
only
for
those
five
years
,
and
I
,
how
do
I
come
in
?
What
right
*NL*
have
I
?
Step
aside
,
Mitya
,
and
make
way
!
What
am
I
now
?
Now
everything
is
*NL*
over
apart
from
the
officer
--
even
if
he
had
not
appeared
,
everything
would
*NL*
be
over
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
would
roughly
have
expressed
his
feelings
,
if
he
had
been
*NL*
capable
of
reasoning
.
But
he
could
not
reason
at
that
moment
.
His
present
*NL*
plan
of
action
had
arisen
without
reasoning
.
At
Fenya
's
first
words
,
it
*NL*
had
sprung
from
feeling
,
and
been
adopted
in
a
flash
,
with
all
its
*NL*
consequences
.
And
yet
,
in
spite
of
his
resolution
,
there
was
confusion
in
*NL*
his
soul
,
an
agonizing
confusion
:
his
resolution
did
not
give
him
peace
.
*NL*
There
was
so
much
behind
that
tortured
him
.
And
it
seemed
strange
to
him
,
*NL*
at
moments
,
to
think
that
he
had
written
his
own
sentence
of
death
with
*NL*
pen
and
paper
:
``
I
punish
myself
,
''
and
the
paper
was
lying
there
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
ready
;
the
pistol
was
loaded
;
he
had
already
resolved
how
,
next
*NL*
morning
,
he
would
meet
the
first
warm
ray
of
``
golden-haired
Phoebus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
could
not
be
quit
of
the
past
,
of
all
that
he
had
left
behind
*NL*
and
that
tortured
him
.
He
felt
that
miserably
,
and
the
thought
of
it
sank
*NL*
into
his
heart
with
despair
.
There
was
one
moment
when
he
felt
an
impulse
*NL*
to
stop
Andrey
,
to
jump
out
of
the
cart
,
to
pull
out
his
loaded
pistol
,
*NL*
and
to
make
an
end
of
everything
without
waiting
for
the
dawn
.
But
that
*NL*
moment
flew
by
like
a
spark
.
The
horses
galloped
on
,
``
devouring
space
,
''
*NL*
and
as
he
drew
near
his
goal
,
again
the
thought
of
her
,
of
her
alone
,
took
*NL*
more
and
more
complete
possession
of
his
soul
,
chasing
away
the
fearful
*NL*
images
that
had
been
haunting
it
.
Oh
,
how
he
longed
to
look
upon
her
,
if
*NL*
only
for
a
moment
,
if
only
from
a
distance
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
now
with
_
him
_
,
''
he
thought
,
``
now
I
shall
see
what
she
looks
like
*NL*
with
him
,
her
first
love
,
and
that
's
all
I
want
.
''
Never
had
this
woman
,
*NL*
who
was
such
a
fateful
influence
in
his
life
,
aroused
such
love
in
his
*NL*
breast
,
such
new
and
unknown
feeling
,
surprising
even
to
himself
,
a
*NL*
feeling
tender
to
devoutness
,
to
self-effacement
before
her
!
``
I
will
*NL*
efface
myself
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
rush
of
almost
hysterical
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
galloping
nearly
an
hour
.
Mitya
was
silent
,
and
though
*NL*
Andrey
was
,
as
a
rule
,
a
talkative
peasant
,
he
did
not
utter
a
word
,
*NL*
either
.
He
seemed
afraid
to
talk
,
he
only
whipped
up
smartly
his
three
*NL*
lean
,
but
mettlesome
,
bay
horses
.
Suddenly
Mitya
cried
out
in
horrible
*NL*
anxiety
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrey
!
What
if
they
're
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
fell
upon
him
like
a
blow
.
It
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
well
be
that
they
're
gone
to
bed
,
by
now
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
frowned
as
though
in
pain
.
Yes
,
indeed
...
he
was
rushing
there
...
*NL*
with
such
feelings
...
while
they
were
asleep
...
she
was
asleep
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
there
too
...
An
angry
feeling
surged
up
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive
on
,
Andrey
!
Whip
them
up
!
Look
alive
!
''
he
cried
,
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
maybe
they
're
not
in
bed
!
''
Andrey
went
on
after
a
pause
.
``
Timofey
*NL*
said
they
were
a
lot
of
them
there
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
station

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
the
posting-station

at
Plastunov

they
*NL*

out
horses
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

So
you
say
there
are
a
lot
of
them
?
How
's
that
?
Who
are
they

''
*NL*
cried
Mitya
,
greatly
dismayed
at
this
unexpected
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Timofey
was
saying
they
're
all
gentlefolk

Two
from

who
*NL*
they
are
I
ca
n't
say
--
and
there
are
two
others

strangers

more
*NL*
besides

I
did
n't
ask
particularly
.
They
've
set
to
playing
cards

*NL*
Timofey
said
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Cards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
maybe
they
're
not
in

they
're
at
cards

It
's
most
likely
not
*NL*
more
than
eleven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quicker
,
Andrey
!
Quicker
!
''
Mitya
cried
again
,
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
you
something
,
sir
?
''
said
Andrey
,
after
a
pause
.
``
Only
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
of
angering
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Fenya
threw
herself
at
your
feet
just
now
,
and
begged
you
not
to
*NL*
harm
her
mistress

some
one
else

too

so
you
see
,
sir

It
's
I
am
*NL*
taking
you
there

forgive

sir

it
's
my
conscience

maybe
it
's
*NL*
stupid
of
me
to
speak
of
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
suddenly
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
driver
?
''
he
asked
frantically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
know
that
one
has
to
make
way

What
would
you
say
to
a
driver
*NL*
who
would
n't
make
way
for
any
one
,
but
would
just
drive
on
and
crush
*NL*
people
?
No
,
a
driver
must
n't
run
over
people

One
ca
n't
run
over

*NL*
One

ruined

life

punish

go
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
These
phrases
burst
from
Mitya
almost
hysterically
.
Though
Andrey
was
*NL*
surprised
at
him
,
he
kept
up
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

quite
right

torment
a
man

any
kind

creature

every
creature
is
created

for

for
some
folks

even
among

anyhow

Nothing

restrain

just
force
it
along

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
hell

''
Mitya
interrupted
,
and
went
off
into
his
abrupt
,
short
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Andrey
,
simple
soul
,
''
he
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
again
,
``
tell
me
,
*NL*
will
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
go

*NL*
*NL*
``

you
see

*NL*
when
the
Son
of
God
was
nailed
on
the
Cross
and
died
,
He
went
straight
*NL*
down
to
hell
from
the
Cross
,
and
set
free
all
sinners
that
were
in
agony

*NL*
And
the
devil
groaned

because
he
thought

would
get
no

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
But
Mitya
did
not
hear

He
was
frantically
praying
and
muttering
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mokroe

''
cried
Andrey
,
pointing
ahead
with
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
pale
darkness
of
the
night
loomed
a
solid
black
mass
of
*NL*
buildings
,
flung
down
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
vast
plain
.
The
village
of
*NL*
Mokroe
numbered
two
thousand
inhabitants
,
but
at
that
hour
all
were
*NL*
asleep
,
and
only
here
and
there
a
few
lights
still
twinkled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive

Mitya
exclaimed
,
feverishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They

said
Andrey
again
,
pointing
with
his
whip
to
the
*NL*
Plastunovs
'
inn
,
which
was
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
.
The
six
*NL*
windows
,
looking
on
the
street
,
were
all
brightly
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They

Mitya
repeated
joyously
.
``
Quicker

Gallop

Drive
up

Set

''
*NL*
*NL*
Andrey
lashed
his
exhausted
team
into
a
gallop
,
drove
with
a
dash
and
*NL*
pulled
up
his
steaming
,
panting
horses
at
the
high
flight
of
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
jumped
out
of
the
cart
just
as
the
innkeeper
,
on
his
way
to
bed
,
*NL*
peeped
out
from
the
steps
curious
to
see
who
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
is
that
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
innkeeper
bent
down
,
looked
intently
,
ran
down
the
steps
,
and
rushed
*NL*
up
to
the
guest
with
obsequious
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
your
honor
!
Do
I
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Trifon
Borissovitch
was
a
thick-set
,
healthy
peasant
,
of
middle
height
,
*NL*
with
a
rather
fat
face
.
His
expression
was
severe
and
uncompromising
,
*NL*
especially
with
the
peasants
of
Mokroe
,
but
he
had
the
power
of
assuming
*NL*
the
most
obsequious
countenance
,
when
he
had
an
inkling
that
it
was
to
his
*NL*
interest
.
He
dressed
in
Russian
style
,
with
a
shirt
buttoning
down
on
one
*NL*
side
,
and
a
full-skirted
coat
.
He
had
saved
a
good
sum
of
money
,
but
was
*NL*
for
ever
dreaming
of
improving
his
position
.
More
than
half
the
peasants
*NL*
were
in
his
clutches
,
every
one
in
the
neighborhood
was
in
debt
to
him
.
*NL*
From
the
neighboring
landowners
he
bought
and
rented
lands
which
were
*NL*
worked
by
the
peasants
,
in
payment
of
debts
which
they
could
never
shake
*NL*
off
.
He
was
a
widower
,
with
four
grown-up
daughters
.
One
of
them
was
*NL*
already
a
widow
and
lived
in
the
inn
with
her
two
children
,
his
*NL*
grandchildren
,
and
worked
for
him
like
a
charwoman
.
Another
of
his
*NL*
daughters
was
married
to
a
petty
official
,
and
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
*NL*
inn
,
on
the
wall
could
be
seen
,
among
the
family
photographs
,
a
miniature
*NL*
photograph
of
this
official
in
uniform
and
official
epaulettes
.
The
two
*NL*
younger
daughters
used
to
wear
fashionable
blue
or
green
dresses
,
fitting
*NL*
tight
at
the
back
,
and
with
trains
a
yard
long
,
on
Church
holidays
or
when
*NL*
they
went
to
pay
visits
.
But
next
morning
they
would
get
up
at
dawn
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
sweep
out
the
rooms
with
a
birch-broom
,
empty
the
slops
,
and
clean
*NL*
up
after
lodgers
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
thousands
of
roubles
he
had
saved
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
was
*NL*
very
fond
of
emptying
the
pockets
of
a
drunken
guest
,
and
remembering
that
*NL*
not
a
month
ago
he
had
,
in
twenty-four
hours
,
made
two
if
not
three
*NL*
hundred
roubles
out
of
Dmitri
,
when
he
had
come
on
his
escapade
with
*NL*
Grushenka
,
he
met
him
now
with
eager
welcome
,
scenting
his
prey
the
moment
*NL*
Mitya
drove
up
to
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

The

For

Trifon

had
hidden

half
a
dozen
bottles
of
champagne
on

had
picked
up

a
hundred-rouble
note
under

Where

In

''
*NL*
*NL*
Trifon
Borissovitch
looked
apprehensively
at
Mitya
,
but
at
once
obediently
*NL*
did
his
bidding
.
Leading
him
into
the
passage
,
he
went
himself
into
the
*NL*
first
large
room
,
adjoining
that
in
which
the
visitors
were
sitting
,
and
*NL*
took
the
light
away
.
Then
he
stealthily
led
Mitya
in
,
and
put
him
in
a
*NL*
corner
in
the
dark
,
whence
he
could
freely
watch
the
company
without
being
*NL*
seen
.
But
Mitya
did
not
look
long
,
and
,
indeed
,
he
could
not
see
them
,
he
*NL*
saw
her
,
his
heart
throbbed
violently
,
and
all
was
dark
before
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
sideways
to
the
table
in
a
low
chair
,
and
beside
her
,
on
*NL*
the
sofa
,
was
the
pretty
youth
,
Kalganov
.
She
was
holding
his
hand
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
laughing
,
while
he
,
seeming
vexed
and
not
looking
at
her
,
was
*NL*
saying
something
in
a
loud
voice
to
Maximov
,
who
sat
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
table
,
facing
Grushenka
.
Maximov
was
laughing
violently
at
something
.
On
*NL*
the
sofa
sat
_
he
_
,
and
on
a
chair
by
the
sofa
there
was
another
stranger
.
*NL*
The
one
on
the
sofa
was
lolling
backwards
,
smoking
a
pipe
,
and
Mitya
had
*NL*
an
impression
of
a
stoutish
,
broad-faced
,
short
little
man
,
who
was
*NL*
apparently
angry
about
something
.
His
friend
,
the
other
stranger
,
struck
*NL*
Mitya
as
extraordinarily
tall
,
but
he
could
make
out
nothing
more
.
He
*NL*
caught
his
breath
.
He
could
not
bear
it
for
a
minute
,
he
put
the
pistol
-
*NL*
case
on
a
chest
,
and
with
a
throbbing
heart
he
walked
,
feeling
cold
all
*NL*
over
,
straight
into
the
blue
room
to
face
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aie
!
''
shrieked
Grushenka
,
the
first
to
notice
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
With
his
long
,
rapid
strides
,
Mitya
walked
straight
up
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
almost
shouting
,
yet
stammering
at
*NL*
every
word
,
``
I
...
I
'm
all
right
!
Do
n't
be
afraid
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
I
--
there
's
nothing
the
matter
,
''
he
turned
suddenly
to
Grushenka
,
who
had
*NL*
shrunk
back
in
her
chair
towards
Kalganov
,
and
clasped
his
hand
tightly
.
*NL*
``
I
...
I
'm
coming
,
too
.
I
'm
here
till
morning

Gentlemen
,
may
I
stay
with
*NL*
you
till

?
Only
till
morning
,
for
the
last
time
,
in
this
same
*NL*
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
finished
,
turning
to
the
fat
little
man
,
with
the
pipe
,
sitting
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
The
latter
removed
his
pipe
from
his
lips
with
dignity
and
*NL*
observed
severely
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Panie

,

're
here
in
private

There
are
other
rooms

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
you
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch

What
do
you
mean
?
''
answered
Kalganov
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
Sit
down
with
us
.
How
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
to
see
you
,
dear
...
and
precious
fellow
,
I
always
thought
a
*NL*
lot
of
you
.
''
Mitya
responded
,
joyfully
and
eagerly
,
at
once
holding
out
*NL*
his
hand
across
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aie
!
How
tight
you
squeeze
!
You
've
quite
broken
my
fingers
,
''
laughed
*NL*
Kalganov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
always
squeezes
like
that
,
always
,
''
Grushenka
put
in
gayly
,
with
a
*NL*
timid
smile
,
seeming
suddenly
convinced
from
Mitya
's
face
that
he
was
not
*NL*
going
to
make
a
scene
.
She
was
watching
him
with
intense
curiosity
and
*NL*
still
some
uneasiness
.
She
was
impressed
by
something
about
him
,
and
*NL*
indeed
the
last
thing
she
expected
of
him
was
that
he
would
come
in
and
*NL*
speak
like
this
at
such
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening

''
Maximov
ventured
blandly
on
the
left
.
Mitya
rushed
up
to
*NL*
him
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

-LRB-
He
addressed
the
Polish
gentleman
with
the
pipe
*NL*
again
,
evidently
taking
him
for
the
most
important
person
present
.
-RRB-
``

*NL*
flew
here

cried
wildly
,
``
I
flew
here

vowed

Something
made
him
pull
out
*NL*
his
bundle
of
notes
.
-RRB-
``
Allow

He
was
almost
choking
.
There
was
so
much
,
so
much
he
wanted
to
say
,
but
*NL*
strange
exclamations
were
all
that
came
from
his
lips

The
Pole
gazed
*NL*
fixedly
at
him
,
at
the
bundle
of
notes
in
his
hand
;
looked
at
Grushenka
,
*NL*
and
was
in
evident
perplexity

*NL*
``

*NL*
you
talking
about
?
Do
n't
frighten
us
,
please
.
You
wo
n't
frighten
us
,
will
*NL*
you
?
If
you
wo
n't
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
me
frighten
you
?
''
cried
Mitya
,
flinging
up
his
hands
.
``
Oh
,
pass
me
*NL*
by
,
go
your
way
,
I
wo
n't
hinder
you
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
he
surprised
them
all
,
and
no
doubt
himself
as
well
,
by
*NL*
flinging
himself
on
a
chair
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
turning
his
head
*NL*
away
to
the
opposite
wall
,
while
his
arms
clasped
the
back
of
the
chair
*NL*
tight
,
as
though
embracing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
what
a
fellow
you
are
!
''
cried
Grushenka
reproachfully
.
*NL*
``
That
's
just
how
he
comes
to
see
me
--
he
begins
talking
,
and
I
ca
n't
make
*NL*
out
what
he
means
.
He
cried
like
that
once
before
,
and
now
he
's
crying
*NL*
again
!
It
's
shameful
!
Why
are
you
crying
?
_
As
though
you
had
anything
to
*NL*
cry
for
!
_
''
she
added
enigmatically
,
emphasizing
each
word
with
some
*NL*
irritability
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
...
I
'm
not
crying
...
Well
,
good
evening
!
''
He
instantly
turned
round
*NL*
in
his
chair
,
and
suddenly
laughed
,
not
his
abrupt
wooden
laugh
,
but
a
*NL*
long
,
quivering
,
inaudible
nervous
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
you
are
again
...
Come
,
cheer
up
,
cheer
up
!
''
Grushenka
said
*NL*
to
him
persuasively
.
``
I
'm
very
glad
you
've
come
,
very
glad
,
Mitya
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
,
I
'm
very
glad
!
I
want
him
to
stay
here
with
us
,
''
she
said
*NL*
peremptorily
,
addressing
the
whole
company
,
though
her
words
were
*NL*
obviously
meant
for
the
man
sitting
on
the
sofa
.
``
I
wish
it
,
I
wish
it
!
*NL*
And
if
he
goes
away
I
shall
go
,
too
!
''
she
added
with
flashing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
my
queen
commands
is
law
!
''
pronounced
the
Pole
,
gallantly
kissing
*NL*
Grushenka
's
hand
.
``
I
beg
you
,
_
panie
_
,
to
join
our
company
,
''
he
added
*NL*
politely
,
addressing
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
jumping
up
with
the
obvious
intention
of
delivering
another
*NL*
tirade
,
but
the
words
did
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
drink
,
_
panie
_
,
''
he
blurted
out
instead
of
making
a
speech
.
Every
*NL*
one
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
I
thought
he
was
going
to
begin
again
!
''
Grushenka
exclaimed
*NL*
nervously
.
``
Do
you
hear
,
Mitya
,
''
she
went
on
insistently
,
``
do
n't
prance
*NL*
about
,
but
it
's
nice
you
've
brought
the
champagne
.
I
want
some
myself
,
and
*NL*
I
ca
n't
bear
liqueurs
.
And
best
of
all
,
you
've
come
yourself
.
We
were
*NL*
fearfully
dull
here
...
You
've
come
for
a
spree
again
,
I
suppose
?
But
put
*NL*
your
money
in
your
pocket
.
Where
did
you
get
such
a
lot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
had
been
,
all
this
time
,
holding
in
his
hand
the
crumpled
bundle
of
*NL*
notes
on
which
the
eyes
of
all
,
especially
of
the
Poles
,
were
fixed
.
In
*NL*
confusion
he
thrust
them
hurriedly
into
his
pocket
.
He
flushed
.
At
that
*NL*
moment
the
innkeeper
brought
in
an
uncorked
bottle
of
champagne
,
and
*NL*
glasses
on
a
tray
.
Mitya
snatched
up
the
bottle
,
but
he
was
so
bewildered
*NL*
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
.
Kalganov
took
it
from
him
and
*NL*
poured
out
the
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
!
Another
bottle
!
''
Mitya
cried
to
the
innkeeper
,
and
,
forgetting
*NL*
to
clink
glasses
with
the
Pole
whom
he
had
so
solemnly
invited
to
drink
to
*NL*
their
good
understanding
,
he
drank
off
his
glass
without
waiting
for
any
*NL*
one
else
.
His
whole
countenance
suddenly
changed
.
The
solemn
and
tragic
*NL*
expression
with
which
he
had
entered
vanished
completely
,
and
a
look
of
*NL*
something
childlike
came
into
his
face
.
He
seemed
to
have
become
suddenly
*NL*
gentle
and
subdued
.
He
looked
shyly
and
happily
at
every
one
,
with
a
*NL*
continual
nervous
little
laugh
,
and
the
blissful
expression
of
a
dog
who
*NL*
has
done
wrong
,
been
punished
,
and
forgiven
.
He
seemed
to
have
forgotten
*NL*
everything
,
and
was
looking
round
at
every
one
with
a
childlike
smile
of
*NL*
delight
.
He
looked
at
Grushenka
,
laughing
continually
,
and
bringing
his
*NL*
chair
close
up
to
her
.
By
degrees
he
had
gained
some
idea
of
the
two
*NL*
Poles
,
though
he
had
formed
no
definite
conception
of
them
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pole
on
the
sofa
struck
him
by
his
dignified
demeanor
and
his
Polish
*NL*
accent
;
and
,
above
all
,
by
his
pipe
.
``
Well
,
what
of
it
?
It
's
a
good
thing
*NL*
he
's
smoking
a
pipe
,
''
he
reflected
.
The
Pole
's
puffy
,
middle-aged
face
,
*NL*
with
its
tiny
nose
and
two
very
thin
,
pointed
,
dyed
and
impudent-looking
*NL*
mustaches
,
had
not
so
far
roused
the
faintest
doubts
in
Mitya
.
He
was
not
*NL*
even
particularly
struck
by
the
Pole
's
absurd
wig
made
in
Siberia
,
with
*NL*
love-locks
foolishly
combed
forward
over
the
temples
.
``
I
suppose
it
's
all
*NL*
right
since
he
wears
a
wig
,
''
he
went
on
,
musing
blissfully
.
The
other
,
*NL*
younger
Pole
,
who
was
staring
insolently
and
defiantly
at
the
company
and
*NL*
listening
to
the
conversation
with
silent
contempt
,
still
only
impressed
*NL*
Mitya
by
his
great
height
,
which
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
Pole
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
``
If
he
stood
up
he
'd
be
six
foot
three
.
''
The
thought
flitted
*NL*
through
Mitya
's
mind
.
It
occurred
to
him
,
too
,
that
this
Pole
must
be
the
*NL*
friend
of
the
other
,
as
it
were
,
a
``
bodyguard
,
''
and
no
doubt
the
big
Pole
*NL*
was
at
the
disposal
of
the
little
Pole
with
the
pipe
.
But
this
all
seemed
*NL*
to
Mitya
perfectly
right
and
not
to
be
questioned
.
In
his
mood
of
doglike
*NL*
submissiveness
all
feeling
of
rivalry
had
died
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
's
mood
and
the
enigmatic
tone
of
some
of
her
words
he
completely
*NL*
failed
to
grasp
.
All
he
understood
,
with
thrilling
heart
,
was
that
she
was
*NL*
kind
to
him
,
that
she
had
forgiven
him
,
and
made
him
sit
by
her
.
He
was
*NL*
beside
himself
with
delight
,
watching
her
sip
her
glass
of
champagne
.
The
*NL*
silence
of
the
company
seemed
somehow
to
strike
him
,
however
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
round
at
every
one
with
expectant
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
we
sitting
here
though
,
gentlemen
?
Why
do
n't
you
begin
doing
*NL*
something
?
''
his
smiling
eyes
seemed
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
keeps
talking
nonsense
,
and
we
were
all
laughing
,
''
Kalganov
began
*NL*
suddenly
,
as
though
divining
his
thought
,
and
pointing
to
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
immediately
stared
at
Kalganov
and
then
at
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
talking
nonsense
?
''
he
laughed
,
his
short
,
wooden
laugh
,
seeming
*NL*
suddenly
delighted
at
something
--
``
ha
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
he
will
have
it
that
all
our
cavalry
officers
*NL*
in
the
twenties
married
Polish
women
.
That
's
awful
rot
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Polish
women
?
''
repeated
Mitya
,
perfectly
ecstatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kalganov
was
well
aware
of
Mitya
's
attitude
to
Grushenka
,
and
he
guessed
*NL*
about
the
Pole
,
too
,
but
that
did
not
so
much
interest
him
,
perhaps
did
*NL*
not
interest
him
at
all
;
what
he
was
interested
in
was
Maximov
.
He
had
*NL*
come
here
with
Maximov
by
chance
,
and
he
met
the
Poles
here
at
the
inn
for
*NL*
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
Grushenka
he
knew
before
,
and
had
once
been
*NL*
with
some
one
to
see
her
;
but
she
had
not
taken
to
him
.
But
here
she
*NL*
looked
at
him
very
affectionately
:
before
Mitya
's
arrival
,
she
had
been
*NL*
making
much
of
him
,
but
he
seemed
somehow
to
be
unmoved
by
it
.
He
was
a
*NL*
boy
,
not
over
twenty
,
dressed
like
a
dandy
,
with
a
very
charming
fair
-
*NL*
skinned
face
,
and
splendid
thick
,
fair
hair
.
From
his
fair
face
looked
out
*NL*
beautiful
pale
blue
eyes
,
with
an
intelligent
and
sometimes
even
deep
*NL*
expression
,
beyond
his
age
indeed
,
although
the
young
man
sometimes
looked
*NL*
and
talked
quite
like
a
child
,
and
was
not
at
all
ashamed
of
it
,
even
when
*NL*
he
was
aware
of
it
himself
.
As
a
rule
he
was
very
willful
,
even
*NL*
capricious
,
though
always
friendly
.
Sometimes
there
was
something
fixed
*NL*
and
obstinate
in
his
expression
.
He
would
look
at
you
and
listen
,
seeming
*NL*
all
the
while
to
be
persistently
dreaming
over
something
else
.
Often
he
*NL*
was
listless
and
lazy
,
at
other
times
he
would
grow
excited
,
sometimes
,
*NL*
apparently
,
over
the
most
trivial
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
imagine
,
I
've
been
taking
him
about
with
me
for
the
last
four
days
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
indolently
drawling
his
words
,
quite
naturally
though
,
without
*NL*
the
slightest
affectation
.
``
Ever
since
your
brother
,
do
you
remember
,
*NL*
shoved
him
off
the
carriage
and
sent
him
flying
.
That
made
me
take
an
*NL*
interest
in
him
at
the
time
,
and
I
took
him
into
the
country
,
but
he
keeps
*NL*
talking
such
rot
I
'm
ashamed
to
be
with
him
.
I
'm
taking
him
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
has
not
seen
Polish
ladies
,
and
says
what
is
impossible
,
''
*NL*
the
Pole
with
the
pipe
observed
to
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
Russian
fairly
well
,
much
better
,
anyway
,
than
he
pretended
.
If
*NL*
he
used
Russian
words
,
he
always
distorted
them
into
a
Polish
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
was
married
to
a
Polish
lady
myself
,

tittered
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

put
in
Kalganov
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
a
cavalry
officer
indeed
?
Ha
ha
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
listening
eagerly
,
*NL*
and
turning
his
inquiring
eyes
to
each
as
he
spoke
,
as
though
there
were
*NL*
no
knowing
what
he
might
hear
from
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
see
,
''
Maximov
turned
to
him
.
``
What
I
mean
is
that
those
pretty
*NL*
Polish
ladies

when
they
danced
the
mazurka
with

Uhlans

when
*NL*
one
of
them
dances

mazurka
with
a
Uhlan

jumps
on
his
knee
like

Maximov
ended
,
tittering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
_
pan

is
a

lajdak

!
''
the
tall
Pole
on
the
chair
growled
suddenly
and
*NL*
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
.
Mitya
's
eye
was
caught
by
his
huge
greased
*NL*
boot
,
with
its
thick
,
dirty
sole
.
The
dress
of
both
the
Poles
looked
*NL*
rather
greasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
it
's

What
's

scolding
about

said
Grushenka
,

suddenly
vexed
.

*NL*

the
Pole
with
the
pipe
observed
to
*NL*
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
reckon
on
that

the
tall
Pole
snapped
contemptuously
.

*NL*
``
What
next

Let

talk

Grushenka
said
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
the
Pole
in
the
wig
,
with
a
long
*NL*
look
at
Grushenka
,
and
relapsing
into
dignified
silence
he
sucked
his
pipe
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

The
Polish
gentleman
spoke
the
truth
.

Kalganov
got
excited
*NL*
again
,
as
though
it
were
a
question
of
vast
import
.
``
He
's
never
been
in
*NL*
Poland
,
so
how
can
he
talk
about
it
?
I
suppose
you
were
n't
married
in
*NL*
Poland
,
were
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

in

a

had
brought
her
to

my
future
wife
,
with
her
mamma

her
aunt
,
and
another
*NL*
female
relation
with
a
grown-up
son

He
brought
her
straight
from
Poland
*NL*
and
gave
her
up
to
me
.
He
was
a
lieutenant
in
our
regiment

a
very
nice

At
first
he
meant

*NL*
``
So
pleased
she
was
going
to
marry
you

yelled
Kalganov
,
in
a
ringing
,
*NL*
childish
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
pleased
.
But
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
a
different
cause

*NL*
Afterwards
,
when
we
were
married
,
after
the
wedding
,
that
very
evening
,
*NL*
she
confessed
,
and
very
touchingly
asked
forgiveness
.
'
I
once
jumped
over
*NL*
a
puddle
when
I
was
a
child
,
'
she
said
,
`
and
injured
my
leg
.

He
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kalganov
went
off
into
the
most
childish
laughter
,
almost
falling
on
the
*NL*
sofa
.
Grushenka
,
too
,
laughed
.
Mitya
was
at
the
pinnacle
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
that
's
the
truth
,
he
's
not
lying
now
,
''
exclaimed
Kalganov
,
*NL*
turning
to
Mitya
;
``
and
do
you
know
,
he
's
been
married
twice
;
it
's
his
*NL*
first
wife
he
's
talking
about
.
But
his
second
wife
,
do
you
know
,
ran
away
,
*NL*
and
is
alive
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
said
Mitya
,
turning
quickly
to
Maximov
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
the
utmost
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
did
run
away
.
I
've
had
that
unpleasant
experience
,
''
Maximov
*NL*
modestly
assented
,
``
with
a
_
monsieur
_
.
And
what
was
worse
,
she
'd
had
all
*NL*
my
little
property
transferred
to
her
beforehand
.
`
You
're
an
educated
*NL*
man
,
'
she
said
to
me
.
`
You
can
always
get
your
living
.
'
She
settled
my
*NL*
business
with
that
.
A
venerable
bishop
once
said
to
me
:
`
One
of
your
wives
*NL*
was
lame
,
but
the
other
was
too
light-footed
.
'
He
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
listen
!
''
cried
Kalganov
,
bubbling
over
,
``
if
he
's
telling
lies
--
and
*NL*
he
often
is
--
he
's
only
doing
it
to
amuse
us
all
.
There
's
no
harm
in
that
,
*NL*
is
there
?
You
know
,
I
sometimes
like
him
.
He
's
awfully
low
,
but
it
's
*NL*
natural
to
him
,
eh
?
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
Some
people
are
low
from
self
-
*NL*
interest
,
but
he
's
simply
so
,
from
nature
.
Only
fancy
,
he
claims
-LRB-
he
was
*NL*
arguing
about
it
all
the
way
yesterday
-RRB-
that
Gogol
wrote
_
Dead
Souls
_
*NL*
about
him
.
Do
you
remember
,
there
's
a
landowner
called
Maximov
in
it
,
whom
*NL*
Nozdryov
thrashed
.
He
was
charged
,
do
you
remember
,
`
for
inflicting
bodily
*NL*
injury
with
rods
on
the
landowner
Maximov
in
a
drunken
condition
.
'
Would
*NL*
you
believe
it
,
he
claims
that
he
was
that
Maximov
and
that
he
was
beaten
!
*NL*
Now
can
it
be
so
?
Tchitchikov
made
his
journey
,
at
the
very
latest
,
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
twenties
,
so
that
the
dates
do
n't
fit
.
He
could
n't
have
*NL*
been
thrashed
then
,
he
could
n't
,
could
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
Kalganov
was
excited
about
,
but
his
*NL*
excitement
was
genuine
.
Mitya
followed
his
lead
without
protest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
if
they
did
thrash
him
!
''
he
cried
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
they
thrashed
me
exactly
,
but
what
I
mean
is

''
put
in
*NL*
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Either
they
thrashed
you
or
they
did
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
o'clock
is
it
,
_
panie

?
''
the
Pole
,
with
the
pipe
,
asked
his
tall
*NL*
friend
,
with
a
bored
expression
.
The
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
*NL*
reply
.
Neither
of
them
had
a
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
talk
?
Let
other
people
talk

Must
n't
other

*NL*
you
're
bored

''
Grushenka
flew
at
him
with
evident
intention
of
finding
*NL*
fault
.
Something
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
flash
upon
Mitya
's
mind
.
*NL*
This
time
the
Pole
answered
with
unmistakable
irritability
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Pani
_
,
I
did
n't
oppose
it

I
did

say
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
then

Come

tell
us
your

Grushenka
cried
to
Maximov
.
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
all
silent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
tell

it
's
all
so
foolish

answered
Maximov
at
once
,
*NL*
with
evident
satisfaction
,
mincing
a
little
.
``
Besides
,
all
that
's
by
way
*NL*
of
allegory
in
Gogol
,
for
he
's
made
all
the
names
have
a
meaning
.
Nozdryov
*NL*
was
really
called
Nosov
,
and
Kuvshinikov
had
quite
a
different
name
,
he
*NL*
was
called
Shkvornev
.
Fenardi
really
was
called
Fenardi
,
only
he
was
n't
an
*NL*
Italian
but
a
Russian
,
and
Mamsel
Fenardi
was
a
pretty
girl
with
her
*NL*
pretty
little
legs
in
tights
,
and
she
had
a
little
short
skirt
with
*NL*
spangles
,
and
she
kept
turning
round
and
round
,
only
not
for
four
hours
*NL*
but
for
four
minutes
only
,
and
she
bewitched
every
one
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
were
you
beaten
for
?
''
cried
Kalganov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Piron
!
''
answered
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Piron
?
''
cried
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
famous
French
writer
,
Piron
.
We
were
all
drinking
then
,
a
big
party
*NL*
of
us
,
in
a
tavern
at
that
very
fair
.
They
'd
invited
me
,
and
first
of
all
*NL*
I
began
quoting
epigrams
.
`
Is
that
you
,
Boileau
?
What
a
funny
get-up
!
'
and
*NL*
Boileau
answers
that
he
's
going
to
a
masquerade
,
that
is
to
the
baths
,
he
*NL*
he
!
And
they
took
it
to
themselves
,
so
I
made
haste
to
repeat
another
,
*NL*
very
sarcastic
,
well
known
to
all
educated
people
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yes

Sappho

Phaon
are

*NL*
But
one
grief
is
weighing
on

*NL*
You
do
n't
know
your
way
to
the
sea

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
still
more
offended
and
began
abusing
me
in
the
most
unseemly
*NL*
way
for
it
.
And
as
ill-luck
would
have
it
,
to
set
things
right
,
I
began
*NL*
telling
a
very
cultivated
anecdote
about
Piron
,
how
he
was
not
accepted
*NL*
into
the
French
Academy
,
and
to
revenge
himself
wrote
his
own
epitaph
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ci-git
Piron

ne
fut

*NL*
*NL*

They
seized

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
for

What
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
education

People
can
thrash
a
man
for
anything

Maximov
*NL*
concluded
,
briefly
and
sententiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
that
's
enough
!
That
's
all

I
do

thought
*NL*
it
would
be
amusing

Grushenka
cut
them
short
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
started
,
and
at
once
left
off
laughing
.
The
tall
Pole
rose
upon
his
*NL*
feet
,
and
with
the
haughty
air
of
a
man
,
bored
and
out
of
his
element
,
*NL*
began
pacing
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
,
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
ca
n't
sit
still

''
said
Grushenka
,
looking
at
him
contemptuously
.
*NL*
Mitya
began
to
feel
anxious
.
He
noticed
besides
,
that
the
Pole
on
the
sofa
*NL*
was
looking
at
him
with
an
irritable
expression

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
In
a
flash
he
had
pulled
three
glasses
towards
him
,
and
filled
them
with
*NL*
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the

on

sofa

with
dignity

affable
condescension

he
took
his
glass

raising

*NL*
All

drank

Mitya
seized
the
bottle
and
again
poured
out
three

glasses

*NL*
*NL*
``

The

*NL*
Mitya
filled

*NL*
``

he
shouted
again
.
All
drank
the
toast
except
the
*NL*
Poles
,
and
Grushenka
tossed
off
her
whole
glass
at
once
.
The
Poles
did
not
*NL*
touch
theirs

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

cried
Mitya

*NL*
*NL*
Pan
Vrublevsky
took
the
glass
,
raised
it
and
said
with
a
resonant
voice
:

*NL*
``

Russia

she
was
before
1772

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

cried
the

shouted
both
the
Poles

menacingly
,
setting
on
Mitya
like
a

cocks

Pan
Vrublevsky
was
specially
furious

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can

cried
Grushenka
*NL*
imperiously
,
and
she
stamped
her
foot
on
the
floor

Her
face
glowed

her

eyes
were
shining

The
effects
of
the

the
cymbals
would
most
*NL*
likely
be
here
soon
;
but
the
cart
with
the
provisions
had
not
yet
arrived
.
*NL*
Mitya
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
ran
into
the
next
room
to
give
orders
,
*NL*
but
only
three
girls
had
arrived
,
and
Marya
was
not
there
yet
.
And
he
did
*NL*
not
know
himself
what
orders
to
give
and
why
he
had
run
out
.
He
only
told
*NL*
them
to
take
out
of
the
box
the
presents
for
the
girls
,
the
sweets
,
the
*NL*
toffee
and
the
fondants
.
``
And
vodka
for
Andrey

vodka
for
Andrey
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
in
haste
.
``
I
was
rude
to
Andrey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Maximov
,
who
had
followed
him
out
,
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
five
roubles
,
''
he
whispered
to
Mitya
.
``
I
'll
stake
something
at
*NL*
faro

too

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital

Splendid

Take

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
took
all
the
notes
out
of
his
pocket
and
picked
out
one
for
ten
*NL*
roubles
.
``
And
if
you
lose
that
,
come
again

come
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

''
Maximov
whispered
joyfully
,
and
he
ran
back
again
.
Mitya
,
*NL*
too
,
returned
,
apologizing
for
having
kept
them
waiting
.
The
Poles
had
*NL*
already
sat
down
,
and
opened
the
pack
.
They
looked
much
more
amiable
,
*NL*
almost
cordial
.
The
Pole
on
the
sofa
had
lighted
another
pipe
and
was
*NL*
preparing
to
throw
.
He
wore
an
air
of
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Pan
Vrublevsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Kalganov

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
Pole
on
the
*NL*
sofa
observed
in
his
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much

asked
Mitya

*NL*
*NL*
``

Both

rose
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

But
something
in

*NL*
suddenly
struck
him
,
and
at
the

instant
something
new
flashed
into

his
mind

a
strange
new
thought

*NL*

_

the

beginning

crimson
with
anger

*NL*
when
Mitya
suddenly
went
up
to
him
and
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
little
_
pan

was
taken
aback
and
looked
apprehensively
at
Mitya

He
*NL*
agreed
at
once
,
however
,
on
condition
that
Pan
Vrublevsky
went
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

anxiously

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll

answered
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sort
of
boldness
,
a
sudden
confidence
shining
in
his
eyes
.
His
*NL*
face
had
looked
very
different
when
he
entered
the
room
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
the
Poles
,
not
into
the
large
room
where
the
chorus
of
girls
was
*NL*
assembling
and
the
table
was
being
laid
,
but
into
the
bedroom
on
the
*NL*
right
,
where
the
trunks
and
packages
were
kept
,
and
there
were
two
large
*NL*
beds
,
with
pyramids
of
cotton
pillows
on
each
.
There
was
a
lighted
candle
*NL*
on
a
small
deal
table
in
the
corner
.
The
small
man
and
Mitya
sat
down
to
*NL*
this
table
,
facing
each
other
,
while
the
huge
Vrublevsky
stood
beside
*NL*
them
,
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
The
Poles
looked
severe
but
were
*NL*
evidently
inquisitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
,

lisped
the
little
Pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
he
pulled
out
his
notes
.
``
Would
you
like
three
thousand

Take
it
and
go
*NL*
your

*NL*
*NL*
The
Pole
gazed
open-eyed
at
Mitya
,
with
a
searching
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
thousand
,
_
panie

He
exchanged
glances
with
Vrublevsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

out

*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
awaited
an
answer
with
assurance
.
He
had
no
doubts
.
An
expression
of
*NL*
extraordinary
resolution
passed
over
the
Pole
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

cried
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Poles
exchanged
glances
again
.
The
short
man
's
face
looked
more
*NL*
forbidding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
hundred

hundred

Mitya
added
,
feeling
something
wrong
.
``

faltered
Mitya
,
his
spirit
sinking
at
every
word
he
uttered
.
``
Upon
*NL*
my
word
,
the
money
's
there

hidden

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
an
extraordinary
sense
of
personal
dignity
showed
itself
in
*NL*
the
little
man
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
''
he
asked
ironically
.
``
For
shame
!
''
and
he
spat
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
Pan
Vrublevsky
spat
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
that
,
_
panie

''
said
Mitya
,
recognizing
with
despair
that
all
was
*NL*
over
,
``
because
you
hope
to
make
more
out

You

's
what
you
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
mortal

The
little
Pole
turned
as
red
as
a
crab
,
and
he
*NL*
went
out
of
the
room
,
briskly
,
as
though
unwilling
to
hear
another
word
.
*NL*
Vrublevsky
swung
out
after
him
,
and
Mitya
followed
,
confused
and
*NL*
crestfallen
.
He
was
afraid
of
Grushenka
,
afraid
that
the
_
pan
_
would
at
*NL*
once
raise
an
outcry
.
And
so
indeed
he
did
.
The
Pole
walked
into
the
room
*NL*
and
threw
himself
in
a
theatrical
attitude
before
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
''

Pani

Agrippina

received

he
exclaimed

But
*NL*
Grushenka
suddenly
lost
all
patience
,
as
though
they
had
wounded
her
in
*NL*
the
tenderest
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

she
cried
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
Pole
gasped
with
offended
dignity
,
and
quickly
and
pompously
delivered
*NL*
himself
in
broken
Russian
:

offered
me
three
thousand

in

the

I
spat
in
the

face
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
He
offered
you
money
for
me
?

cried
Grushenka
,
hysterically
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
true

How
dare
you

Am
I
for

*NL*
*NL*
''

Panie

yelled
Mitya
,
``
she
's
pure
and
shining

I
have
never

That
's
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
defend
me
to
him
?
''
shrieked
Grushenka
.
``
It
was
n't
virtue
*NL*
kept
me
pure
,
and
it
was
n't
that
I
was
afraid
of
Kuzma
,
but
that
I
might
*NL*
hold
up
my
head
when
I
met
him
,
and
tell
him
he
's
a
scoundrel
.
And
he
did
*NL*
actually
refuse
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
took
it
!
He
took
it
!

cried
Mitya
;
``
only
he
wanted
to
get
the
whole

three
thousand

I

only

off

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
the
little
Pole
.

I
'm

a
knight

I

a
nobleman

not

I
came
here
to
make
you
my

I
find
you
a
*NL*
different
woman
,
perverse
and
shameless

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

go
back
where
you

I
'll
tell

turn
you
out

you
'll
be
turned
out

cried
Grushenka
,
furious
.
``
I
've
been
a
fool

a

fool

it

miserable

It

He
was
a

this
is
a
gander

He
used

sing

me

been
crying

five

damned
fool

abject

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
back
in
her
low
chair
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
At
that
*NL*
instant
the
chorus
of
Mokroe
began
singing
in
the
room
on
the
left
--
a
*NL*
rollicking
dance
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
regular
Sodom
!
''
Vrublevsky
roared
suddenly
.
``
Landlord
,
send
the
*NL*
shameless
hussies
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
past
inquisitively
peeping
in
at
*NL*
the
door
,
hearing
shouts
and
guessing
that
his
guests
were
quarreling
,
at
*NL*
once
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
shouting
for
?
D'you
want
to
split
your
throat
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
addressing
Vrublevsky
,
with
surprising
rudeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Animal
!
''
bellowed
Pan
Vrublevsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Animal
?
And
what
sort
of
cards
were
you
playing
with
just
now
?
I
gave
you
*NL*
a
pack
and
you
hid
it
.
You
played
with
marked
cards
!
I
could
send
you
to
*NL*
Siberia
for
playing
with
false
cards
,
d'you
know
that
,
for
it
's
just
the
*NL*
same
as
false
banknotes
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
going
up
to
the
sofa
he
thrust
his
fingers
between
the
sofa
back
and
*NL*
the
cushion
,
and
pulled
out
an
unopened
pack
of
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
my
pack
unopened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
it
up
and
showed
it
to
all
in
the
room
.
``
From
where
I
stood
I
saw
*NL*
him
slip
my
pack
away
,
and
put
his
in
place
of
it

you
're
a
cheat
and
not
a
*NL*
gentleman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
twice
saw
the
_
pan
_
change
a
card
!
''
cried
Kalganov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shameful
!
How
shameful
!
''
exclaimed
Grushenka
,
clasping
her
hands
,
and
*NL*
blushing
for
genuine
shame
.
``
Good
Lord
,
he
's
come
to
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
,
too
!
''
said
Mitya
.
But
before
he
had
uttered
the
words
,
*NL*
Vrublevsky
,
with
a
confused
and
infuriated
face
,
shook
his
fist
at
*NL*
Grushenka
,
shouting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
low
harlot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
flew
at
him
at
once
,
clutched
him
in
both
hands
,
lifted
him
in
the
*NL*
air
,
and
in
one
instant
had
carried
him
into
the
room
on
the
right
,
from
*NL*
which
they
had
just
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
laid
him
on
the
floor
,
there
,
''
he
announced
,
returning
at
once
,
*NL*
gasping
with
excitement
.
``
He
's
struggling
,
the
scoundrel
!
But
he
wo
n't
*NL*
come
back
,
no
fear
of
that
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
one
half
of
the
folding
doors
,
and
holding
the
other
ajar
called
*NL*
out
to
the
little
Pole
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
illustrious
,
will
you
be
pleased
to
retire
as
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
said
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
``
make
them
give
*NL*
you
back
the
money
you
lost
.
It
's
as
good
as
stolen
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
my
fifty
roubles
back
,
''
Kalganov
declared
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
my
two
hundred
,
either
,
''
cried
Mitya
,
``
I
would
n't
take
it
*NL*
for
anything
!
Let
him
keep
it
as
a
consolation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
Mitya
!
You
're
a
trump
,
Mitya
!
''
cried
Grushenka
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
note
of
fierce
anger
in
the
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
_
pan
_
,
crimson
with
fury
but
still
mindful
of
his
dignity
,
was
*NL*
making
for
the
door
,
but
he
stopped
short
and
said
suddenly
,
addressing
*NL*
Grushenka
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Pani
_
,
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
,
come
.
If
not
,
good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
swelling
with
indignation
and
importance
he
went
to
the
door
.
This
was
*NL*
a
man
of
character
:
he
had
so
good
an
opinion
of
himself
that
after
all
*NL*
that
had
passed
,
he
still
expected
that
she
would
marry
him
.
Mitya
slammed
*NL*
the
door
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lock
it
,
''
said
Kalganov
.
But
the
key
clicked
on
the
other
side
,
they
had
*NL*
locked
it
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
capital
!
''
exclaimed
Grushenka
relentlessly
.
``
Serve
them
right
!

Chapter
VIII
.
Delirium
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
followed
was
almost
an
orgy
,
a
feast
to
which
all
were
welcome
.
*NL*
Grushenka
was
the
first
to
call
for
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
drink
.
I
want
to
be
quite
drunk
,
as
we
were
before
.
Do
you
*NL*
remember
,
Mitya
,
do
you
remember
how
we
made
friends
here
last
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
himself
was
almost
delirious
,
feeling
that
his
happiness
was
at
*NL*
hand
.
But
Grushenka
was
continually
sending
him
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
enjoy
yourself
.
Tell
them
to
dance
,
to
make
merry
,
`
let
the
stove
*NL*
and
cottage
dance
'
;
as
we
had
it
last
time
,
''
she
kept
exclaiming
.
She
was
*NL*
tremendously
excited
.
And
Mitya
hastened
to
obey
her
.
The
chorus
were
in
*NL*
the
next
room
.
The
room
in
which
they
had
been
sitting
till
that
moment
*NL*
was
too
small
,
and
was
divided
in
two
by
cotton
curtains
,
behind
which
was
*NL*
a
huge
bed
with
a
puffy
feather
mattress
and
a
pyramid
of
cotton
pillows
.
*NL*
In
the
four
rooms
for
visitors
there
were
beds
.
Grushenka
settled
herself
*NL*
just
at
the
door
.
Mitya
set
an
easy
chair
for
her
.
She
had
sat
in
the
same
*NL*
place
to
watch
the
dancing
and
singing
``
the
time
before
,
''
when
they
had
*NL*
made
merry
there
.
All
the
girls
who
had
come
had
been
there
then
;
the
*NL*
Jewish
band
with
fiddles
and
zithers
had
come
,
too
,
and
at
last
the
long
*NL*
expected
cart
had
arrived
with
the
wines
and
provisions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
bustled
about
.
All
sorts
of
people
began
coming
into
the
room
to
*NL*
look
on
,
peasants
and
their
women
,
who
had
been
roused
from
sleep
and
*NL*
attracted
by
the
hopes
of
another
marvelous
entertainment
such
as
they
had
*NL*
enjoyed
a
month
before
.
Mitya
remembered
their
faces
,
greeting
and
*NL*
embracing
every
one
he
knew
.
He
uncorked
bottles
and
poured
out
wine
for
*NL*
every
one
who
presented
himself
.
Only
the
girls
were
very
eager
for
the
*NL*
champagne
.
The
men
preferred
rum
,
brandy
,
and
,
above
all
,
hot
punch
.
Mitya
*NL*
had
chocolate
made
for
all
the
girls
,
and
ordered
that
three
samovars
*NL*
should
be
kept
boiling
all
night
to
provide
tea
and
punch
for
everyone
to
*NL*
help
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
absurd
chaotic
confusion
followed
,
but
Mitya
was
in
his
natural
*NL*
element
,
and
the
more
foolish
it
became
,
the
more
his
spirits
rose
.
If
the
*NL*
peasants
had
asked
him
for
money
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
pulled
out
*NL*
his
notes
and
given
them
away
right
and
left
.
This
was
probably
why
the
*NL*
landlord
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
kept
hovering
about
Mitya
to
protect
him
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
have
given
up
all
idea
of
going
to
bed
that
night
;
but
he
*NL*
drank
little
,
only
one
glass
of
punch
,
and
kept
a
sharp
look-out
on
*NL*
Mitya
's
interests
after
his
own
fashion
.
He
intervened
in
the
nick
of
*NL*
time
,
civilly
and
obsequiously
persuading
Mitya
not
to
give
away
``
cigars
*NL*
and
Rhine
wine
,
''
and
,
above
all
,
money
to
the
peasants
as
he
had
done
*NL*
before
.
He
was
very
indignant
,
too
,
at
the
peasant
girls
drinking
liqueur
,
*NL*
and
eating
sweets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
a
lousy
lot
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'd
give
them
a
*NL*
kick
,
every
one
of
them
,
and
they
'd
take
it
as
an
honor
--
that
's
all
they
're
*NL*
worth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
remembered
Andrey
again
,
and
ordered
punch
to
be
sent
out
to
him
.
``
I
*NL*
was
rude
to
him
just
now
,
''
he
repeated
with
a
sinking
,
softened
voice
.
*NL*
Kalganov
did
not
want
to
drink
,
and
at
first
did
not
care
for
the
girls
'
*NL*
singing
;
but
after
he
had
drunk
a
couple
of
glasses
of
champagne
he
became
*NL*
extraordinarily
lively
,
strolling
about
the
room
,
laughing
and
praising
*NL*
the
music
and
the
songs
,
admiring
every
one
and
everything
.
Maximov
,
*NL*
blissfully
drunk
,
never
left
his
side
.
Grushenka
,
too
,
was
beginning
to
*NL*
get
drunk
.
Pointing
to
Kalganov
,
she
said
to
Mitya
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dear
,
charming
boy
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mitya
,
delighted
,
ran
to
kiss
Kalganov
and
Maximov
.
Oh
,
great
were
his
*NL*
hopes
!
She
had
said
nothing
yet
,
and
seemed
,
indeed
,
purposely
to
refrain
*NL*
from
speaking
.
But
she
looked
at
him
from
time
to
time
with
caressing
and
*NL*
passionate
eyes
.
At
last
she
suddenly
gripped
his
hand
and
drew
him
*NL*
vigorously
to
her
.
She
was
sitting
at
the
moment
in
the
low
chair
by
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
you
came
just
now
,
eh
?
Have
you
walked
in
!
...
I
was
*NL*
frightened
.
So
you
wanted
to
give
me
up
to
him
,
did
you
?
Did
you
really
*NL*
want
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
spoil
your
happiness
!
''
Mitya
faltered
blissfully
.
But
*NL*
she
did
not
need
his
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
and
enjoy
yourself
...
''
she
sent
him
away
once
more
.
``
Do
n't
cry
,
*NL*
I
'll
call
you
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
run
away
,
and
she
listened
to
the
singing
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
dancing
,
though
her
eyes
followed
him
wherever
he
went
.
But
in
another
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
she
would
call
him
once
more
and
again
he
would
run
*NL*
back
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sit
beside
me
,
tell
me
,
how
did
you
hear
about
me
,
and
my
coming
*NL*
here
yesterday
?
From
whom
did
you
first
hear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mitya
began
telling
her
all
about
it
,
disconnectedly
,
incoherently
,
*NL*
feverishly
.
He
spoke
strangely
,
often
frowning
,
and
stopping
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
frowning
at
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
...
I
left
a
man
ill
there
.
I
'd
give
ten
years
of
my
life
for
him
*NL*
to
get
well
,
to
know
he
was
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
him
,
if
he
's
ill
.
So
you
meant
to
shoot
yourself
to
-
*NL*
morrow
!
What
a
silly
boy
!
What
for
?
I
like
such
reckless
fellows
as
you
,
''
*NL*
she
lisped
,
with
a
rather
halting
tongue
.
``
So
you
would
go
any
length
for
*NL*
me
,
eh
?
Did
you
really
mean
to
shoot
yourself
to-morrow
,
you
stupid
?
No
,
*NL*
wait
a
little
.
To-morrow
I
may
have
something
to
say
to
you
...
I
wo
n't
*NL*
say
it
to-day
,
but
to-morrow
.
You
'd
like
it
to
be
to-day

No
,
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
to-day
.
Come
,
go
along
now
,
go
and
amuse
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
however
,
she
called
him
,
as
it
were
,
puzzled
and
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
sad
?
I
see
you
're
sad
...
Yes
,
I
see
it
,
''
she
added
,
looking
*NL*
intently
into
his
eyes
.
``
Though
you
keep
kissing
the
peasants
and
*NL*
shouting
,
I
see
something
.
No
,
be
merry
.
I
'm
merry
;
you
be
merry
,
too
...
*NL*
I
love
somebody
here
.
Guess
who
it
is
.
Ah
,
look
,
my
boy
has
fallen
asleep
,
*NL*
poor
dear
,
he
's
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
meant
Kalganov
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
drunk
,
and
had
dropped
asleep
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
sitting
on
the
sofa
.
But
he
was
not
merely
drowsy
from
drink
;
he
*NL*
felt
suddenly
dejected
,
or
,
as
he
said
,
``
bored
.
''
He
was
intensely
*NL*
depressed
by
the
girls
'
songs
,
which
,
as
the
drinking
went
on
,
gradually
*NL*
became
coarse
and
more
reckless
.
And
the
dances
were
as
bad
.
Two
girls
*NL*
dressed
up
as
bears
,
and
a
lively
girl
,
called
Stepanida
,
with
a
stick
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
acted
the
part
of
keeper
,
and
began
to
``
show
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
alive
,
Marya
,
or
you
'll
get
the
stick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bears
rolled
on
the
ground
at
last
in
the
most
unseemly
fashion
,
amid
*NL*
roars
of
laughter
from
the
closely-packed
crowd
of
men
and
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
them
!
Let
them
!
''
said
Grushenka
sententiously
,
with
an
ecstatic
*NL*
expression
on
her
face
.
``
When
they
do
get
a
day
to
enjoy
themselves
,
why
*NL*
should
n't
folks
be
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kalganov
looked
as
though
he
had
been
besmirched
with
dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
swinish
,
all
this
peasant
foolery
,
''
he
murmured
,
moving
away
;
``
it
's
*NL*
the
game
they
play
when
it
's
light
all
night
in
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
particularly
disliked
one
``
new
''
song
to
a
jaunty
dance-tune
.
It
*NL*
described
how
a
gentleman
came
and
tried
his
luck
with
the
girls
,
to
see
*NL*
whether
they
would
love
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
came
to
try
the
girls
:
*NL*
Would
they
love
him
,
would
they
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
girls
could
not
love
the
master
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
beat
me
cruelly
*NL*
And
such
love
wo
n't
do
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
gypsy
comes
along
and
he
,
too
,
tries
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
came
to
try
the
girls
:
*NL*
Would
they
love
him
,
would
they
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
could
n't
love
the
gypsy
either
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
be
a
thief
,
I
fear
,
*NL*
And
would
cause
me
many
a
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
many
more
men
come
to
try
their
luck
,
among
them
a
soldier
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
came
to
try
the
girls
:
*NL*
Would
they
love
him
,
would
they
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
soldier
is
rejected
with
contempt
,
in
two
indecent
lines
,
sung
*NL*
with
absolute
frankness
and
producing
a
furore
in
the
audience
.
The
song
*NL*
ends
with
a
merchant
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
merchant
came
to
try
the
girls
:
*NL*
Would
they
love
him
,
would
they
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
appears
that
he
wins
their
love
because
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
merchant
will
make
gold
for
me
*NL*
And
his
queen
I
'll
gladly
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kalvanov
was
positively
indignant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
a
song
of
yesterday
,
''
he
said
aloud
.
``
Who
writes
such
things
*NL*
for
them
?
They
might
just
as
well
have
had
a
railwayman
or
a
Jew
come
to
*NL*
try
his
luck
with
the
girls
;
they
'd
have
carried
all
before
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
almost
as
though
it
were
a
personal
affront
,
he
declared
,
on
the
*NL*
spot
,
that
he
was
bored
,
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
immediately
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
His
pretty
little
face
looked
rather
pale
,
as
it
fell
back
on
the
sofa
*NL*
cushion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
how
pretty
he
is
,
''
said
Grushenka
,
taking
Mitya
up
to
him
.
``
I
was
*NL*
combing
his
hair
just
now
;
his
hair
's
like
flax
,
and
so
thick
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
bending
over
him
tenderly
,
she
kissed
his
forehead
.
Kalganov
*NL*
instantly
opened
his
eyes
,
looked
at
her
,
stood
up
,
and
with
the
most
*NL*
anxious
air
inquired
where
was
Maximov
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
who
it
is
you
want
.
''
Grushenka
laughed
.
``
Stay
with
me
a
minute
.
*NL*
Mitya
,
run
and
find
his
Maximov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maximov
,
it
appeared
,
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
the
girls
,
only
*NL*
running
away
from
time
to
time
to
pour
himself
out
a
glass
of
liqueur
.
He
*NL*
had
drunk
two
cups
of
chocolate
.
His
face
was
red
,
and
his
nose
was
*NL*
crimson
;
his
eyes
were
moist
and
mawkishly
sweet
.
He
ran
up
and
announced
*NL*
that
he
was
going
to
dance
the
``
sabotiere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
taught
me
all
those
well-bred
,
aristocratic
dances
when
I
was
*NL*
little
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
go
with
him
,
Mitya
,
and
I
'll
watch
from
here
how
he
dances
,
''
said
*NL*
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
'm
coming
to
look
on
,
too
,
''
exclaimed
Kalganov
,
brushing
aside
*NL*
in
the
most
naive
way
Grushenka
's
offer
to
sit
with
him
.
They
all
went
to
*NL*
look
on
.
Maximov
danced
his
dance
.
But
it
roused
no
great
admiration
in
*NL*
any
one
but
Mitya
.
It
consisted
of
nothing
but
skipping
and
hopping
,
*NL*
kicking
up
the
feet
,
and
at
every
skip
Maximov
slapped
the
upturned
sole
*NL*
of
his
foot
.
Kalganov
did
not
like
it
at
all
,
but
Mitya
kissed
the
dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
.
You
're
tired
perhaps
?
What
are
you
looking
for
here
?
Would
you
*NL*
like
some
sweets
?
A
cigar
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cigarette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
a
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
have
a
liqueur
...
Have
you
any
chocolates
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
a
heap
of
them
on
the
table
there
.
Choose
one
,
my
dear
*NL*
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
one
with
vanilla
...
for
old
people
.
He
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
brother
,
we
've
none
of
that
special
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
the
old
man
bent
down
to
whisper
in
Mitya
's
ear
.
``
That
girl
*NL*
there
,
little
Marya
,
he
he
!
How
would
it
be
if
you
were
to
help
me
make
*NL*
friends
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
what
you
're
after
!
No
,
brother
,
that
wo
n't
do
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
do
no
harm
to
any
one

Maximov
muttered
disconsolately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
all
right
.
They
only
come
here
to
dance
and
sing
,
you
*NL*
know

brother
.
But
damn
it
all
,
wait
a
bit
!
...
Eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
,
*NL*
meanwhile
.
Do
n't
you
want
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Later
on
,
perhaps

smiled
Maximov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
's
head
was
burning
.
He
went
outside
to
the
wooden
balcony
which
ran
*NL*
round
the
whole
building
on
the
inner
side
,
overlooking
the
courtyard
.
The
*NL*
fresh
air
revived
him
.
He
stood
alone
in
a
dark
corner
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
clutched
his
head
in
both
hands
.
His
scattered
thoughts
came
together
;
his
*NL*
sensations
blended
into
a
whole
and
threw
a
sudden
light
into
his
mind
.
A
*NL*
fearful
and
terrible
light
!
``
If
I
'm
to
shoot
myself
,
why
not
now
?
''
passed
*NL*
through
his
mind
.
``
Why
not
go
for
the
pistols
,
bring
them
here
,
and
here
,
*NL*
in
this
dark
dirty
corner
,
make
an
end
?
''
Almost
a
minute
he
stood
,
*NL*
undecided
.
A
few
hours
earlier
,
when
he
had
been
dashing
here
,
he
was
*NL*
pursued
by
disgrace
,
by
the
theft
he
had
committed
,
and
that
blood
,
that
*NL*
blood
!
...
But
yet
it
was
easier
for
him
then
.
Then
everything
was
over
:
he
*NL*
had
lost
her
,
given
her
up
.
She
was
gone
,
for
him
--
oh
,
then
his
death
*NL*
sentence
had
been
easier
for
him
;
at
least
it
had
seemed
necessary
,
*NL*
inevitable
,
for
what
had
he
to
stay
on
earth
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
?
Was
it
the
same
as
then
?
Now
one
phantom
,
one
terror
at
least
was
*NL*
at
an
end
:
that
first
,
rightful
lover
,
that
fateful
figure
had
vanished
,
*NL*
leaving
no
trace
.
The
terrible
phantom
had
turned
into
something
so
small
,
*NL*
so
comic
;
it
had
been
carried
into
the
bedroom
and
locked
in
.
It
would
*NL*
never
return
.
She
was
ashamed
,
and
from
her
eyes
he
could
see
now
whom
she
*NL*
loved
.
Now
he
had
everything
to
make
life
happy
...
but
he
could
not
go
on
*NL*
living
,
he
could
not
;
oh
,
damnation
!
``
O
God
!
restore
to
life
the
man
I
*NL*
knocked
down
at
the
fence
!
Let
this
fearful
cup
pass
from
me
!
Lord
,
thou
*NL*
hast
wrought
miracles
for
such
sinners
as
me
!
But
what
,
what
if
the
old
*NL*
man
's
alive
?
Oh
,
then
the
shame
of
the
other
disgrace
I
would
wipe
away
.
I
*NL*
would
restore
the
stolen
money
.
I
'd
give
it
back
;
I
'd
get
it
somehow
...
*NL*
No
trace
of
that
shame
will
remain
except
in
my
heart
for
ever
!
But
no
,
*NL*
no
;
oh
,
impossible
cowardly
dreams
!
Oh
,
damnation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
there
was
a
ray
of
light
and
hope
in
his
darkness
.
He
jumped
up
and
*NL*
ran
back
to
the
room
--
to
her
,
to
her
,
his
queen
for
ever
!
Was
not
one
*NL*
moment
of
her
love
worth
all
the
rest
of
life
,
even
in
the
agonies
of
*NL*
disgrace
?
This
wild
question
clutched
at
his
heart
.
``
To
her
,
to
her
alone
,
*NL*
to
see
her
,
to
hear
her
,
to
think
of
nothing
,
to
forget
everything
,
if
*NL*
only
for
that
night
,
for
an
hour
,
for
a
moment
!
''
Just
as
he
turned
from
*NL*
the
balcony
into
the
passage
,
he
came
upon
the
landlord
,
Trifon
*NL*
Borissovitch
.
He
thought
he
looked
gloomy
and
worried
,
and
fancied
he
had
*NL*
come
to
find
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
?
are
you
looking
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
The
landlord
seemed
disconcerted
.
``
Why
should
I
be
looking
for
*NL*
you
?
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
look
so
glum
?
You
're
not
angry
,
are
you
?
Wait
a
bit
,
you
shall
*NL*
soon
get
to
bed
...
What
's
the
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
three
o'clock
.
Past
three
,
it
must
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
leave
off
soon
.
We
'll
leave
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mention
it
;
it
does
n't
matter
.
Keep
it
up
as
long
as
you
like
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
''
Mitya
wondered
for
an
instant
,
and
he
ran
*NL*
back
to
the
room
where
the
girls
were
dancing
.
But
she
was
not
there
.
She
*NL*
was
not
in
the
blue
room
either
;
there
was
no
one
but
Kalganov
asleep
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
Mitya
peeped
behind
the
curtain
--
she
was
there
.
She
was
sitting
*NL*
in
the
corner
,
on
a
trunk
.
Bent
forward
,
with
her
head
and
arms
on
the
bed
*NL*
close
by
,
she
was
crying
bitterly
,
doing
her
utmost
to
stifle
her
sobs
*NL*
that
she
might
not
be
heard
.
Seeing
Mitya
,
she
beckoned
him
to
her
,
and
*NL*
when
he
ran
to
her
,
she
grasped
his
hand
tightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
Mitya
,
I
loved
him
,
you
know
.
How
I
have
loved
him
these
five
*NL*
years
,
all
that
time
!
Did
I
love
him
or
only
my
own
anger
?
No
,
him
,
him
!
*NL*
It
's
a
lie
that
it
was
my
anger
I
loved
and
not
him
.
Mitya
,
I
was
only
*NL*
seventeen
then
;
he
was
so
kind
to
me
,
so
merry
;
he
used
to
sing
to
me
...
*NL*
Or
so
it
seemed
to
a
silly
girl
like
me
...
And
now
,
O
Lord
,
it
's
not
the
*NL*
same
man
.
Even
his
face
is
not
the
same
;
he
's
different
altogether
.
I
*NL*
should
n't
have
known
him
.
I
drove
here
with
Timofey
,
and
all
the
way
I
was
*NL*
thinking
how
I
should
meet
him
,
what
I
should
say
to
him
,
how
we
should
*NL*
look
at
one
another
.
My
soul
was
faint
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
just
as
*NL*
though
he
had
emptied
a
pail
of
dirty
water
over
me
.
He
talked
to
me
like
*NL*
a
schoolmaster
,
all
so
grave
and
learned
;
he
met
me
so
solemnly
that
I
was
*NL*
struck
dumb
.
I
could
n't
get
a
word
in
.
At
first
I
thought
he
was
ashamed
*NL*
to
talk
before
his
great
big
Pole
.
I
sat
staring
at
him
and
wondering
why
*NL*
I
could
n't
say
a
word
to
him
now
.
It
must
have
been
his
wife
that
ruined
*NL*
him
;
you
know
he
threw
me
up
to
get
married
.
She
must
have
changed
him
*NL*
like
that
.
Mitya
,
how
shameful
it
is
!
Oh
,
Mitya
,
I
'm
ashamed
,
I
'm
ashamed
*NL*
for
all
my
life
.
Curse
it
,
curse
it
,
curse
those
five
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
she
burst
into
tears
,
but
clung
tight
to
Mitya
's
hand
and
did
*NL*
not
let
it
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
darling
,
stay
,
do
n't
go
away
.
I
want
to
say
one
word
to
you
,
''
she
*NL*
whispered
,
and
suddenly
raised
her
face
to
him
.
``
Listen
,
tell
me
who
it
is
*NL*
I
love
?
I
love
one
man
here
.
Who
is
that
man
?
That
's
what
you
must
tell
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
lighted
up
her
face
that
was
swollen
with
weeping
,
and
her
eyes
*NL*
shone
in
the
half
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
falcon
flew
in
,
and
my
heart
sank
.
`
Fool
!
that
's
the
man
you
love
!
'
*NL*
That
was
what
my
heart
whispered
to
me
at
once
.
You
came
in
and
all
grew
*NL*
bright
.
What
's
he
afraid
of
?
I
wondered
.
For
you
were
frightened
;
you
*NL*
could
n't
speak
.
It
's
not
them
he
's
afraid
of
--
could
you
be
frightened
of
*NL*
any
one
?
It
's
me
he
's
afraid
of
,
I
thought
,
only
me
.
So
Fenya
told
you
,
*NL*
you
little
stupid
,
how
I
called
to
Alyosha
out
of
the
window
that
I
'd
*NL*
loved
Mityenka
for
one
hour
,
and
that
I
was
going
now
to
love
...
another
.
*NL*
Mitya
,
Mitya
,
how
could
I
be
such
a
fool
as
to
think
I
could
love
any
one
*NL*
after
you
?
Do
you
forgive
me
,
Mitya
?
Do
you
forgive
me
or
not
?
Do
you
love
*NL*
me
?
Do
you
love
me
?
''
She
jumped
up
and
held
him
with
both
hands
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
Mitya
,
dumb
with
rapture
,
gazed
into
her
eyes
,
at
her
face
,
at
*NL*
her
smile
,
and
suddenly
clasped
her
tightly
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
*NL*
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
forgive
me
for
having
tormented
you
?
It
was
through
spite
I
*NL*
tormented
you
all
.
It
was
for
spite
I
drove
the
old
man
out
of
his
*NL*
mind
...
Do
you
remember
how
you
drank
at
my
house
one
day
and
broke
the
*NL*
wine-glass
?
I
remembered
that
and
I
broke
a
glass
to-day
and
drank
`
to
my
*NL*
vile
heart
.
'
Mitya
,
my
falcon
,
why
do
n't
you
kiss
me
?
He
kissed
me
once
,
*NL*
and
now
he
draws
back
and
looks
and
listens
.
Why
listen
to
me
?
Kiss
me
,
*NL*
kiss
me
hard
,
that
's
right
.
If
you
love
,
well
,
then
,
love
!
I
'll
be
your
*NL*
slave
now
,
your
slave
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
It
's
sweet
to
be
a
slave
.
*NL*
Kiss
me
!
Beat
me
,
ill-treat
me
,
do
what
you
will
with
me
...
And
I
do
*NL*
deserve
to
suffer
.
Stay
,
wait
,
afterwards
,
I
wo
n't
have
that
...
''
she
*NL*
suddenly
thrust
him
away
.
``
Go
along
,
Mitya
,
I
'll
come
and
have
some
wine
,
*NL*
I
want
to
be
drunk
,
I
'm
going
to
get
drunk
and
dance
;
I
must
,
I
must
!
''
She
*NL*
tore
herself
away
from
him
and
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
.
Mitya
*NL*
followed
like
a
drunken
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
come
what
may
--
whatever
may
happen
now
,
for
one
minute
I
'd
give
the
*NL*
whole
world
,
''
he
thought
.
Grushenka
did
,
in
fact
,
toss
off
a
whole
glass
*NL*
of
champagne
at
one
gulp
,
and
became
at
once
very
tipsy
.
She
sat
down
in
*NL*
the
same
chair
as
before
,
with
a
blissful
smile
on
her
face
.
Her
cheeks
*NL*
were
glowing
,
her
lips
were
burning
,
her
flashing
eyes
were
moist
;
there
*NL*
was
passionate
appeal
in
her
eyes
.
Even
Kalganov
felt
a
stir
at
the
heart
*NL*
and
went
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
feel
how
I
kissed
you
when
you
were
asleep
just
now
?
''
she
said
*NL*
thickly
.
``
I
'm
drunk
now
,
that
's
what
it
is
...
And
are
n't
you
drunk
?
And
*NL*
why
is
n't
Mitya
drinking
?
Why
do
n't
you
drink
,
Mitya
?
I
'm
drunk
,
and
you
*NL*
do
n't
drink
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
drunk
!
I
'm
drunk
as
it
is
...
drunk
with
you
...
and
now
I
'll
be
*NL*
drunk
with
wine
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
off
another
glass
,
and
--
he
thought
it
strange
himself
--
that
glass
*NL*
made
him
completely
drunk
.
He
was
suddenly
drunk
,
although
till
that
*NL*
moment
he
had
been
quite
sober
,
he
remembered
that
.
From
that
moment
*NL*
everything
whirled
about
him
,
as
though
he
were
delirious
.
He
walked
,
*NL*
laughed
,
talked
to
everybody
,
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
.
Only
one
*NL*
persistent
burning
sensation
made
itself
felt
continually
,
``
like
a
red-hot
*NL*
coal
in
his
heart
,
''
he
said
afterwards
.
He
went
up
to
her
,
sat
beside
her
,
*NL*
gazed
at
her
,
listened
to
her
...
She
became
very
talkative
,
kept
calling
*NL*
every
one
to
her
,
and
beckoned
to
different
girls
out
of
the
chorus
.
When
*NL*
the
girl
came
up
,
she
either
kissed
her
,
or
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
*NL*
over
her
.
In
another
minute
she
might
have
cried
.
She
was
greatly
amused
*NL*
by
the
``
little
old
man
,
''
as
she
called
Maximov
.
He
ran
up
every
minute
to
*NL*
kiss
her
hands
,
``
each
little
finger
,
''
and
finally
he
danced
another
dance
*NL*
to
an
old
song
,
which
he
sang
himself
.
He
danced
with
special
vigor
to
the
*NL*
refrain
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
pig
says
--
umph
!
umph
!
umph
!
*NL*
The
little
calf
says
--
moo
,
moo
,
moo
,
*NL*
The
little
duck
says
--
quack
,
quack
,
quack
,
*NL*
The
little
goose
says
--
ga
,
ga
,
ga.
.
*NL*
The
hen
goes
strutting
through
the
porch
;
*NL*
Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo
,
she
'll
say
,
*NL*
Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo
,
she
'll
say
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
something
,
Mitya
,
''
said
Grushenka
.
``
Give
him
a
present
,
he
's
*NL*
poor
,
you
know
.
Ah
,
the
poor
,
the
insulted
!
...
Do
you
know
,
Mitya
,
I
shall
*NL*
go
into
a
nunnery
.
No
,
I
really
shall
one
day
,
Alyosha
said
something
to
*NL*
me
to-day
that
I
shall
remember
all
my
life
...
Yes
...
But
to-day
let
us
*NL*
dance
.
To-morrow
to
the
nunnery
,
but
to-day
we
'll
dance
.
I
want
to
play
*NL*
to-day
,
good
people
,
and
what
of
it
?
God
will
forgive
us
.
If
I
were
God
,
*NL*
I
'd
forgive
every
one
:
`
My
dear
sinners
,
from
this
day
forth
I
forgive
*NL*
you
.
'
I
'm
going
to
beg
forgiveness
:
`
Forgive
me
,
good
people
,
a
silly
*NL*
wench
.
'
I
'm
a
beast
,
that
's
what
I
am
.
But
I
want
to
pray
.
I
gave
a
little
*NL*
onion
.
Wicked
as
I
've
been
,
I
want
to
pray
.
Mitya
,
let
them
dance
,
do
n't
*NL*
stop
them
.
Every
one
in
the
world
is
good
.
Every
one
--
even
the
worst
of
*NL*
them
.
The
world
's
a
nice
place
.
Though
we
're
bad
the
world
's
all
right
.
*NL*
We
're
good
and
bad
,
good
and
bad
...
Come
,
tell
me
,
I
've
something
to
ask
*NL*
you
:
come
here
every
one
,
and
I
'll
ask
you
:
Why
am
I
so
good
?
You
know
I
*NL*
am
good
.
I
'm
very
good
...
Come
,
why
am
I
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Grushenka
babbled
on
,
getting
more
and
more
drunk
.
At
last
she
*NL*
announced
that
she
was
going
to
dance
,
too
.
She
got
up
from
her
chair
,
*NL*
staggering
.
``
Mitya
,
do
n't
give
me
any
more
wine
--
if
I
ask
you
,
do
n't
give
*NL*
it
to
me
.
Wine
does
n't
give
peace
.
Everything
's
going
round
,
the
stove
,
*NL*
and
everything
.
I
want
to
dance
.
Let
every
one
see
how
I
dance
...
let
*NL*
them
see
how
beautifully
I
dance
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
really
meant
it
.
She
pulled
a
white
cambric
handkerchief
out
of
her
*NL*
pocket
,
and
took
it
by
one
corner
in
her
right
hand
,
to
wave
it
in
the
*NL*
dance
.
Mitya
ran
to
and
fro
,
the
girls
were
quiet
,
and
got
ready
to
break
*NL*
into
a
dancing
song
at
the
first
signal
.
Maximov
,
hearing
that
Grushenka
*NL*
wanted
to
dance
,
squealed
with
delight
,
and
ran
skipping
about
in
front
of
*NL*
her
,
humming
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
legs
so
slim
and
sides
so
trim
*NL*
And
its
little
tail
curled
tight
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
Grushenka
waved
her
handkerchief
at
him
and
drove
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh-h
!
Mitya
,
why
do
n't
they
come
?
Let
every
one
come
...
to
look
on
.
Call
*NL*
them
in
,
too
,
that
were
locked
in
...
Why
did
you
lock
them
in
?
Tell
them
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
dance
.
Let
them
look
on
,
too
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
walked
with
a
drunken
swagger
to
the
locked
door
,
and
began
knocking
*NL*
to
the
Poles
with
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,
you
...
Podvysotskys
!
Come
,
she
's
going
to
dance
.
She
calls
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Lajdak
!
_
''
one
of
the
Poles
shouted
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
_
lajdak
_
yourself
!
You
're
a
little
scoundrel
,
that
's
what
you
*NL*
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off
laughing
at
Poland
,
''
said
Kalganov
sententiously
.
He
too
was
*NL*
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
boy
!
If
I
call
him
a
scoundrel
,
it
does
n't
mean
that
I
called
*NL*
all
Poland
so
.
One
_
lajdak
_
does
n't
make
a
Poland
.
Be
quiet
,
my
pretty
*NL*
boy
,
eat
a
sweetmeat

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
what
fellows
!
As
though
they
were
not
men
.
Why
wo
n't
they
make
*NL*
friends
?
''
said
Grushenka
,
and
went
forward
to
dance
.
The
chorus
broke
into
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
porch
,
my
new
porch
!
''
Grushenka
flung
back
her
head
,
half
opened
*NL*
her
lips
,
smiled
,
waved
her
handkerchief
,
and
suddenly
,
with
a
violent
*NL*
lurch
,
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
looking
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
weak
...
''
she
said
in
an
exhausted
voice
.
``
Forgive
me
...
I
'm
weak
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
...
I
'm
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
to
the
chorus
,
and
then
began
bowing
in
all
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
...
Forgive
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
's
been
drinking
.
The
pretty
lady
has
been
drinking
,
''
voices
were
*NL*
heard
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
's
drunk
too
much
,
''
Maximov
explained
to
the
girls
,
giggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
lead
me
away
...
take
me
,
''
said
Grushenka
helplessly
.
Mitya
*NL*
pounced
on
her
,
snatched
her
up
in
his
arms
,
and
carried
the
precious
*NL*
burden
through
the
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
I
'll
go
,
''
thought
Kalganov
,
and
walking
out
of
the
blue
room
,
*NL*
he
closed
the
two
halves
of
the
door
after
him
.
But
the
orgy
in
the
larger
*NL*
room
went
on
and
grew
louder
and
louder
.
Mitya
laid
Grushenka
on
the
bed
*NL*
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
...
''
she
faltered
,
in
an
imploring
voice
.
``
Do
n't
touch
me
,
*NL*
till
I
'm
yours
...
I
've
told
you
I
'm
yours

but
do
n't
touch
me

spare
*NL*
me

With
them
here
,
with

close
,
you
must
n't

He
's
here

It
's
nasty
*NL*
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
obey
you
!
I
wo
n't
think
of
it
...
I
worship
you
!

muttered
Mitya
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
nasty
here
,
it
's
abominable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
holding
her
in
his
arms
,
he
sank
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
though
you
're
a
brute
,
you
're
generous

Grushenka
articulated
*NL*
with
difficulty
.
``
It

be
honorable

it
shall
be
honorable

the
*NL*
future

*NL*
take
me
away

take
me
far

I

*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes

it
must
be

said
Mitya
,
pressing
her
in
his
arms
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
take
you
and
we
'll
fly
away

Oh
,
I
'd
give
my
whole

for
one
year
*NL*
only
to
know
about
that
blood
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
blood
?
''
asked
Grushenka
,
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
muttered
Mitya
,
through
his
teeth
.
``
Grusha
,
you
wanted
to
be
*NL*
honest
,
but
I
'm
a
thief

But
I
've
stolen
money
from
Katya
...
Disgrace
,
a
*NL*
disgrace
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Katya

from
that
young
lady

No
,
you
did
n't
steal
it

Give
it
her

back
,
take
it
from
me
...
Why
make
a
fuss
?
Now
everything
of
mine
is
*NL*
yours
.
What
does
money
matter
?
We
shall
waste
it
anyway
...
Folks
like
us
*NL*
are
bound
to
waste
money
.
But
we
'd
better
go
and
work
the
land
.
I
want
to
*NL*
dig
the
earth
with
my
own

We
must
work

do
you
hear

Alyosha
said
*NL*
so
.
I
wo

I
'll
be
faithful

I

down

we

Take

*NL*
Do
n't

Do
n't

any
more
.
If
you

her

I
shall
*NL*
strangle

I

*NL*
*NL*
``

Do
you

there
's
a

Where
is
that

bell
ringing

There
are
people
coming

Now
it
's
stopped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
her
eyes
,
exhausted
,
and
suddenly
fell
asleep
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
There
had
certainly
been
the
sound
of
a
bell
in
the
distance
,
but
the
*NL*
ringing
had
ceased
.
Mitya
let
his
head
sink
on
her
breast
.
He
did
not
*NL*
notice
that
the
bell
had
ceased
ringing
,
nor
did
he
notice
that
the
songs
*NL*
had
ceased
,
and
that
instead
of
singing
and
drunken
clamor
there
was
*NL*
absolute
stillness
in
the
house
.
Grushenka
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
Was
I
asleep
?
Yes
...
a
bell
...
I
've
been
asleep
and
*NL*
dreamt
I
was
driving
over
the
snow
with
bells
,
and
I
dozed
.
I
was
with
*NL*
some
one
I
loved
,
with
you
.
And
far
,
far
away
.
I
was
holding
you
and
*NL*
kissing
you
,
nestling
close
to
you
.
I
was
cold
,
and
the
snow
glistened
...
*NL*
You
know
how
the
snow
glistens
at
night
when
the
moon
shines
.
It
was
as
*NL*
though
I
was
not
on
earth
.
I
woke
up
,
and
my
dear
one
is
close
to
me
.
How
*NL*
sweet
that
is
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
to
you
,
''
murmured
Mitya
,
kissing
her
dress
,
her
bosom
,
her
hands
.
*NL*
And
suddenly
he
had
a
strange
fancy
:
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
looking
*NL*
straight
before
her
,
not
at
him
,
not
into
his
face
,
but
over
his
head
,
*NL*
with
an
intent
,
almost
uncanny
fixity
.
An
expression
of
wonder
,
almost
of
*NL*
alarm
,
came
suddenly
into
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
who
is
that
looking
at
us
?
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
turned
,
and
saw
that
some
one
had
,
in
fact
,
parted
the
curtains
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
watching
them
.
And
not
one
person
alone
,
it
seemed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
and
walked
quickly
to
the
intruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
come
to
us
,
come
here
,
''
said
a
voice
,
speaking
not
loudly
,
but
*NL*
firmly
and
peremptorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
and
stood
stock
still
.
The
*NL*
room
was
filled
with
people
,
but
not
those
who
had
been
there
before
.
An
*NL*
instantaneous
shiver
ran
down
his
back
,
and
he
shuddered
.
He
recognized
*NL*
all
those
people
instantly
.
That
tall
,
stout
old
man
in
the
overcoat
and
*NL*
forage-cap
with
a
cockade
--
was
the
police
captain
,
Mihail
Makarovitch
.
And
*NL*
that
``
consumptive-looking
''
trim
dandy
,
``
who
always
has
such
polished
*NL*
boots
''
--
that
was
the
deputy
prosecutor
.
``
He
has
a
chronometer
worth
four
*NL*
hundred
roubles
;
he
showed
it
to
me
.
''
And
that
small
young
man
in
*NL*
spectacles
...
Mitya
forgot
his
surname
though
he
knew
him
,
had
seen
him
:
*NL*
he
was
the
``
investigating
lawyer
,
''
from
the
``
school
of
jurisprudence
,
''
who
*NL*
had
only
lately
come
to
the
town
.
And
this
man
--
the
inspector
of
police
,
*NL*
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
,
a
man
he
knew
well
.
And
those
fellows
with
the
*NL*
brass
plates
on
,
why
are
they
here
?
And
those
other
two
...
peasants
...
*NL*
And
there
at
the
door
Kalganov
with
Trifon
Borissovitch
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
!
What
's
this
for
,
gentlemen
?
''
began
Mitya
,
but
suddenly
,
as
*NL*
though
beside
himself
,
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
,
he
cried
aloud
,
at
*NL*
the
top
of
his
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
un
--
der
--
stand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
in
spectacles
moved
forward
suddenly
,
and
stepping
up
to
*NL*
Mitya
,
began
with
dignity
,
though
hurriedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
to
make
...
in
brief
,
I
beg
you
to
come
this
way

this
way

sofa

It
is
absolutely
imperative
that
you
should
give
an
explanation

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old

cried
Mitya
frantically
.
``
The
old
man
and
his
blood
!
...
I
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sank
,
almost
fell
,
on
a
chair
close
by
,
as
though
he
had
been
mown
*NL*
down
by
a
scythe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
?
He
understands
it

Monster
and
parricide

''
the
old
captain
of
police
roared
suddenly
,
*NL*
stepping
up
to
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
beside
himself
,
crimson
in
the
face
and
quivering
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
impossible
!
''
cried
the
small
young
man
.
``
Mihail
Makarovitch
,
*NL*
Mihail
Makarovitch
,
this
wo
n't
do
!
...
I
beg
you
'll
allow
me
to
speak
.
I
*NL*
should
never
have
expected
such
behavior
from
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
delirium
,
gentlemen
,
raving
delirium
,
''
cried
the
captain
of
*NL*
police
;
``
look
at
him
:
drunk
,
at
this
time
of
night
,
in
the
company
of

disreputable

,
with
the
blood
of
his
father
on
his
hands

It

delirium

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
most
earnestly
,
dear
Mihail
Makarovitch
,
to
restrain
your
*NL*
feelings

the
prosecutor
said
in
a
rapid
whisper
to
the
old
police
*NL*
captain
,
``
or
I
shall
be
forced
to
resort
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
little
lawyer
did
not
allow
him
to
finish
.
He
turned
to
Mitya
,
and
*NL*
delivered
himself
in
a
loud
,
firm
,
dignified
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ex-Lieutenant
Karamazov

it
is
my
duty

perpetrated

this
night

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
something
more
,
and
the
prosecutor
,
too
,
put
in
something
,
but
*NL*
though
Mitya
heard
them
he
did
not
understand
them
.
He
stared
at
them
all
*NL*
with
wild
eyes

The
Preliminary
Investigation
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I
.
The
Beginning
Of
Perhotin
's
Official
Career
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
Perhotin
,
whom
we
left
knocking
at
the
strong
locked
gates
*NL*
of
the
widow
Morozov
's
house
,
ended
,
of
course
,
by
making
himself
heard
.
*NL*
Fenya
,
who
was
still
excited
by
the
fright
she
had
had
two
hours
before
,
*NL*
and
too
much
``
upset
''
to
go
to
bed
,
was
almost
frightened
into
hysterics
on
*NL*
hearing
the
furious
knocking
at
the
gate
.
Though
she
had
herself
seen
him
*NL*
drive
away
,
she
fancied
that
it
must
be
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
knocking
*NL*
again
,
no
one
else
could
knock
so
savagely
.
She
ran
to
the
house-porter
,
*NL*
who
had
already
waked
up
and
gone
out
to
the
gate
,
and
began
imploring
him
*NL*
not
to
open
it
.
But
having
questioned
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
and
learned
that
he
*NL*
wanted
to
see
Fenya
on
very
``
important
business
,
''
the
man
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
at
last
to
open
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
admitted
into
Fenya
's
kitchen
,
but
the
*NL*
girl
begged
him
to
allow
the
house-porter
to
be
present
,
``
because
of
her
*NL*
misgivings
.
''
He
began
questioning
her
and
at
once
learnt
the
most
vital
*NL*
fact
,
that
is
,
that
when
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
had
run
out
to
look
for
*NL*
Grushenka
,
he
had
snatched
up
a
pestle
from
the
mortar
,
and
that
when
he
*NL*
returned
,
the
pestle
was
not
with
him
and
his
hands
were
smeared
with
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
blood
was
simply
flowing
,
dripping
from
him
,
dripping
!
''
Fenya
*NL*
kept
exclaiming
.
This
horrible
detail
was
simply
the
product
of
her
*NL*
disordered
imagination
.
But
although
not
``
dripping
,
''
Pyotr
Ilyitch
had
*NL*
himself
seen
those
hands
stained
with
blood
,
and
had
helped
to
wash
them
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
question
he
had
to
decide
was
not
how
soon
the
blood
had
*NL*
dried
,
but
where
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
had
run
with
the
pestle
,
or
rather
,
*NL*
whether
it
really
was
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
,
and
how
he
could
*NL*
satisfactorily
ascertain
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
persisted
in
returning
to
this
*NL*
point
,
and
though
he
found
out
nothing
conclusive
,
yet
he
carried
away
a
*NL*
conviction
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
could
have
gone
nowhere
but
to
his
*NL*
father
's
house
,
and
that
therefore
something
must
have
happened
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
he
came
back
,
''
Fenya
added
with
excitement
,
``
I
told
him
the
*NL*
whole
story
,
and
then
I
began
asking
him
,
`
Why
have
you
got
blood
on
your
*NL*
hands
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
?
'
and
he
answered
that
that
was
human
blood
,
*NL*
and
that
he
had
just
killed
some
one
.
He
confessed
it
all
to
me
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
ran
off
like
a
madman
.
I
sat
down
and
began
thinking
,
where
's
he
*NL*
run
off
to
now
like
a
madman
?
He
'll
go
to
Mokroe
,
I
thought
,
and
kill
my
*NL*
mistress
there
.
I
ran
out
to
beg
him
not
to
kill
her
.
I
was
running
to
his
*NL*
lodgings
,
but
I
looked
at
Plotnikov
's
shop
,
and
saw
him
just
setting
off
,
*NL*
and
there
was
no
blood
on
his
hands
then
.
''
-LRB-
Fenya
had
noticed
this
and
*NL*
remembered
it
.
-RRB-
Fenya
's
old
grandmother
confirmed
her
evidence
as
far
as
*NL*
she
was
capable
.
After
asking
some
further
questions
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
left
*NL*
the
house
,
even
more
upset
and
uneasy
than
he
had
been
when
he
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
direct
and
the
easiest
thing
for
him
to
do
would
have
been
to
go
*NL*
straight
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
,
to
find
out
whether
anything
had
happened
*NL*
there
,
and
if
so
,
what
;
and
only
to
go
to
the
police
captain
,
as
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
firmly
intended
doing
,
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
of
the
fact
.
*NL*
But
the
night
was
dark
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
gates
were
strong
,
and
he
*NL*
would
have
to
knock
again
.
His
acquaintance
with
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
of
*NL*
the
slightest
,
and
what
if
,
after
he
had
been
knocking
,
they
opened
to
*NL*
him
,
and
nothing
had
happened
?
Then
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
in
his
jeering
way
*NL*
would
go
telling
the
story
all
over
the
town
,
how
a
stranger
,
called
*NL*
Perhotin
,
had
broken
in
upon
him
at
midnight
to
ask
if
any
one
had
killed
*NL*
him
.
It
would
make
a
scandal
.
And
scandal
was
what
Pyotr
Ilyitch
dreaded
*NL*
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
feeling
that
possessed
him
was
so
strong
,
that
though
he
stamped
*NL*
his
foot
angrily
and
swore
at
himself
,
he
set
off
again
,
not
to
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
but
to
Madame
Hohlakov
's
.
He
decided
that
if
she
denied
*NL*
having
just
given
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
three
thousand
roubles
,
he
would
go
*NL*
straight
to
the
police
captain
,
but
if
she
admitted
having
given
him
the
*NL*
money
,
he
would
go
home
and
let
the
matter
rest
till
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
,
of
course
,
perfectly
evident
that
there
was
even
more
likelihood
of
*NL*
causing
scandal
by
going
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
to
a
fashionable
lady
,
*NL*
a
complete
stranger
,
and
perhaps
rousing
her
from
her
bed
to
ask
her
an
*NL*
amazing
question
,
than
by
going
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
But
that
is
just
how
*NL*
it
is
,
sometimes
,
especially
in
cases
like
the
present
one
,
with
the
*NL*
decisions
of
the
most
precise
and
phlegmatic
people
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
by
*NL*
no
means
phlegmatic
at
that
moment
.
He
remembered
all
his
life
how
a
*NL*
haunting
uneasiness
gradually
gained
possession
of
him
,
growing
more
and
*NL*
more
painful
and
driving
him
on
,
against
his
will
.
Yet
he
kept
cursing
*NL*
himself
,
of
course
,
all
the
way
for
going
to
this
lady
,
but
``
I
will
get
to
*NL*
the
bottom
of
it
,
I
will
!
''
he
repeated
for
the
tenth
time
,
grinding
his
*NL*
teeth
,
and
he
carried
out
his
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
exactly
eleven
o'clock
when
he
entered
Madame
Hohlakov
's
house
.
He
*NL*
was
admitted
into
the
yard
pretty
quickly
,
but
,
in
response
to
his
inquiry
*NL*
whether
the
lady
was
still
up
,
the
porter
could
give
no
answer
,
except
*NL*
that
she
was
usually
in
bed
by
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
If
the
lady
wants
to
receive
you
,
she
'll
*NL*
receive
you
.
If
she
wo
n't
,
she
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
went
up
,
but
did
not
find
things
so
easy
here
.
The
footman
*NL*
was
unwilling
to
take
in
his
name
,
but
finally
called
a
maid
.
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
politely
but
insistently
begged
her
to
inform
her
lady
that
an
*NL*
official
,
living
in
the
town
,
called
Perhotin
,
had
called
on
particular
*NL*
business
,
and
that
if
it
were
not
of
the
greatest
importance
he
would
not
*NL*
have
ventured
to
come
.
``
Tell
her
in
those
words
,
in
those
words
exactly
,
''
*NL*
he
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
away
.
He
remained
waiting
in
the
entry
.
Madame
Hohlakov
herself
*NL*
was
already
in
her
bedroom
,
though
not
yet
asleep
.
She
had
felt
upset
ever
*NL*
since
Mitya
's
visit
,
and
had
a
presentiment
that
she
would
not
get
through
*NL*
the
night
without
the
sick
headache
which
always
,
with
her
,
followed
such
*NL*
excitement
.
She
was
surprised
on
hearing
the
announcement
from
the
maid
.
*NL*
She
irritably
declined
to
see
him
,
however
,
though
the
unexpected
visit
at
*NL*
such
an
hour
,
of
an
``
official
living
in
the
town
,
''
who
was
a
total
*NL*
stranger
,
roused
her
feminine
curiosity
intensely
.
But
this
time
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
.
He
begged
the
maid
most
earnestly
to
*NL*
take
another
message
in
these
very
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
had
come
on
business
of
the
greatest
importance
,
and
that
Madame
*NL*
Hohlakov
might
have
cause
to
regret
it
later
,
if
she
refused
to
see
him
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
plunged
headlong
,
''
he
described
it
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maid
,
gazing
at
him
in
amazement
,
went
to
take
his
message
again
.
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
was
impressed
.
She
thought
a
little
,
asked
what
he
looked
*NL*
like
,
and
learned
that
he
was
``
very
well
dressed
,
young
and
so
polite
.
''
We
*NL*
may
note
,
parenthetically
,
that
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
a
rather
good-looking
*NL*
young
man
,
and
well
aware
of
the
fact
.
Madame
Hohlakov
made
up
her
mind
to
*NL*
see
him
.
She
was
in
her
dressing-gown
and
slippers
,
but
she
flung
a
black
*NL*
shawl
over
her
shoulders
.
``
The
official
''
was
asked
to
walk
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
the
very
room
in
which
Mitya
had
been
received
shortly
*NL*
before
.
The
lady
came
to
meet
her
visitor
,
with
a
sternly
inquiring
*NL*
countenance
,
and
,
without
asking
him
to
sit
down
,
began
at
once
with
the
*NL*
question
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
ventured
to
disturb
you
,
madam
,
on
a
matter
concerning
our
common
*NL*
acquaintance
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
,
''
Perhotin
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
hardly
uttered
the
name
,
when
the
lady
's
face
showed
signs
of
*NL*
acute
irritation
.
She
almost
shrieked
,
and
interrupted
him
in
a
fury
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
longer
am
I
to
be
worried
by
that
awful
man
?
''
she
cried
*NL*
hysterically
.
``
How
dare
you
,
sir
,
how
could
you
venture
to
disturb
a
lady
*NL*
who
is
a
stranger
to
you
,
in
her
own
house
at
such
an
hour
!
...
And
to
*NL*
force
yourself
upon
her
to
talk
of
a
man
who
came
here
,
to
this
very
*NL*
drawing-room
,
only
three
hours
ago
,
to
murder
me
,
and
went
stamping
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
as
no
one
would
go
out
of
a
decent
house
.
Let
me
tell
you
,
sir
,
*NL*
that
I
shall
lodge
a
complaint
against
you
,
that
I
will
not
let
it
pass

Kindly
leave
me
at
once

I
am
a
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Murder

he
tried
to
murder
you

too

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
has
he
killed
somebody
else
?
''
Madame
Hohlakov
asked
impulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
kindly
listen
,
madam
,
for
half
a
moment
,
I
'll
explain
it
all
*NL*
in
a
couple
of
words
,
''
answered
Perhotin
,
firmly
.
``
At
five
o'clock
this
*NL*
afternoon
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
borrowed
ten
roubles
from
me
,
and
I
know
for
*NL*
a
fact
he
had
no
money
.
Yet
at
nine
o'clock
,
he
came
to
see
me
with
a
*NL*
bundle
of
hundred-rouble
notes
in
his
hand
,
about
two
or
three
thousand
*NL*
roubles
.
His
hands
and
face
were
all
covered
with
blood
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
like
a
madman
.
When
I
asked
him
where
he
had
got
so
much
money
,
he
*NL*
answered
that
he
had
just
received
it
from
you
,
that
you
had
given
him
a
*NL*
sum
of
three
thousand
to
go
to
the
gold-mines
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
's
face
assumed
an
expression
of
intense
and
painful
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
He
must
have
killed
his
old
father
!
''
she
cried
,
clasping
her
*NL*
hands
.
``
I
have
never
given
him
money
,
never
!
Oh

run
,
run

Do
n't
say
*NL*
another
word

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
madam
,
then
you
did
not
give
him
money
?
You
remember
for
a
*NL*
fact
that
you
did
not
give
him
any
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
did
n't

I
did

I
refused
to
give
it
him
,
for
he
could
not
*NL*
appreciate
it
.
He
ran
out
in
a
fury
,
stamping
.
He
rushed
at
me
,
but
I
*NL*
slipped
away
...
And
let
me
tell
you
,
as
I
wish
to
hide
nothing
from
you
*NL*
now
,
that
he
positively
spat
at
me

Can
you
fancy
that
!
But
why
are
we

standing
?
Ah

sit
down

*NL*

``
But

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
she
had
made
Pyotr
Ilyitch
sit
down
and
sat
down
herself
,
facing
*NL*
him
.
Briefly
,
but
fairly
clearly
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
told
her
the
history
of
*NL*
the
affair
,
that
part
of
it
at
least
which
he
had
himself
witnessed
.
He
*NL*
described
,
too
,
his
visit
to
Fenya
,
and
told
her
about
the
pestle
.
All
*NL*
these
details
produced
an
overwhelming
effect
on
the
distracted
lady
,
who
*NL*
kept
uttering
shrieks
,
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
,
I
foresaw
all
this
!
I
have
that
special
faculty
,
*NL*
whatever
I
imagine
comes
to
pass
.
And
how
often
I
've
looked
at
that
awful
*NL*
man
and
always
thought
,
that
man
will
end
by
murdering
me
.
And
now
it
's
*NL*
happened
...
that
is
,
if
he
has
n't
murdered
me
,
but
only
his
own
father
,
*NL*
it
's
only
because
the
finger
of
God
preserved
me
,
and
what
's
more
,
he
was
*NL*
ashamed
to
murder
me
because
,
in
this
very
place
,
I
put
the
holy
ikon
from
*NL*
the
relics
of
the
holy
martyr
,
Saint
Varvara
,
on
his
neck
...
And
to
think
*NL*
how
near
I
was
to
death
at
that
minute
,
I
went
close
up
to
him
and
he
*NL*
stretched
out
his
neck
to
me
!

Do
you
know
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
-LRB-
I
think
you
*NL*
said
your
name
was
Pyotr
Ilyitch
-RRB-

I
do
n't
believe
in
miracles
,
but
that
*NL*
ikon
and
this
unmistakable
miracle
with
me
now
--
that
shakes
me
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
ready
to
believe
in
anything
you
like
.
Have
you
heard
about
Father
*NL*
Zossima
?

But
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
saying

and
only
fancy
,
with
the
*NL*
ikon
on
his
neck
he
spat
at
me
...
He
only
spat
,
it
's
true
,
he
did
n't
*NL*
murder
me
and
...
he
dashed
away
!
But
what
shall
we
do
,
what
must
we
do
*NL*
now
?
What
do
you
think

*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
got
up
,
and
announced
that
he
was
going
straight
to
the
*NL*
police
captain

to
tell
him
all
about
it

leave
him
to
do
what

thought
fit

*NL*
``

``
Especially

very
well

observed
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
,
who
still
continued
to
stand
,
and
was
obviously
anxious
to
escape
*NL*
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
impulsive
lady

who
would
not
let
him
say
*NL*
good-by

go
away

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
prattled
on

``

still
speaking

scribbled
on
half
a

the

And
she
made
the
sign

the
cross
three
times
over
him

She
ran
out
to

accompany
him
to
the
passage

But
Pyotr

had
already
run
away

she
would
not
have
let
him
go
so
*NL*
soon

Yet
Madame
Hohlakov
had
made
a
rather
agreeable
impression
on
him
,
*NL*
which
had
somewhat
softened
his
anxiety
at
being
drawn
into
such
an
*NL*
unpleasant
affair

Tastes
differ

as
we
all
know

As
for

she

.
``
Such
*NL*
sense
!
such
exactness
!
in
so
young
a
man
!
in
our
day
!
and
all
that
with
*NL*
such
manners
and
appearance
!
People
say
the
young
people
of
to-day
are
no
*NL*
good
for
anything
,
but
here
's
an
example
!
''
etc.
.
So
she
simply
forgot
this
*NL*
``
dreadful
affair
,
''
and
it
was
only
as
she
was
getting
into
bed
,
that
,
*NL*
suddenly
recalling
``
how
near
death
she
had
been
,
''
she
exclaimed
:
``
Ah
,
it
*NL*
is
awful
,
awful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
fell
at
once
into
a
sound
,
sweet
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
,
however
,
have
dwelt
on
such
trivial
and
irrelevant
details
,
*NL*
if
this
eccentric
meeting
of
the
young
official
with
the
by
no
means
*NL*
elderly
widow
had
not
subsequently
turned
out
to
be
the
foundation
of
the
*NL*
whole
career
of
that
practical
and
precise
young
man
.
His
story
is
*NL*
remembered
to
this
day
with
amazement
in
our
town
,
and
I
shall
perhaps
*NL*
have
something
to
say
about
it
,
when
I
have
finished
my
long
history
of
*NL*
the
Brothers
Karamazov
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
II
.
The
Alarm
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
police
captain
,
Mihail
Makarovitch
Makarov
,
a
retired
lieutenant
-
*NL*
colonel
,
was
a
widower
and
an
excellent
man
.
He
had
only
come
to
us
three
*NL*
years
previously
,
but
had
won
general
esteem
,
chiefly
because
he
``
knew
how
*NL*
to
keep
society
together
.
''
He
was
never
without
visitors
,
and
could
not
*NL*
have
got
on
without
them
.
Some
one
or
other
was
always
dining
with
him
;
he
*NL*
never
sat
down
to
table
without
guests
.
He
gave
regular
dinners
,
too
,
on
*NL*
all
sorts
of
occasions
,
sometimes
most
surprising
ones
.
Though
the
fare
*NL*
was
not
_
recherche
_
,
it
was
abundant
.
The
fish-pies
were
excellent
,
and
*NL*
the
wine
made
up
in
quantity
for
what
it
lacked
in
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
room
his
guests
entered
was
a
well-fitted
billiard-room
,
with
*NL*
pictures
of
English
race-horses
,
in
black
frames
on
the
walls
,
an
*NL*
essential
decoration
,
as
we
all
know
,
for
a
bachelor
's
billiard-room
.
*NL*
There
was
card-playing
every
evening
at
his
house
,
if
only
at
one
table
.
*NL*
But
at
frequent
intervals
,
all
the
society
of
our
town
,
with
the
mammas
*NL*
and
young
ladies
,
assembled
at
his
house
to
dance
.
Though
Mihail
*NL*
Makarovitch
was
a
widower
,
he
did
not
live
alone
.
His
widowed
daughter
*NL*
lived
with
him
,
with
her
two
unmarried
daughters
,
grown-up
girls
,
who
had
*NL*
finished
their
education
.
They
were
of
agreeable
appearance
and
lively
*NL*
character
,
and
though
every
one
knew
they
would
have
no
dowry
,
they
*NL*
attracted
all
the
young
men
of
fashion
to
their
grandfather
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mihail
Makarovitch
was
by
no
means
very
efficient
in
his
work
,
though
he
*NL*
performed
his
duties
no
worse
than
many
others
.
To
speak
plainly
,
he
was
a
*NL*
man
of
rather
narrow
education
.
His
understanding
of
the
limits
of
his
*NL*
administrative
power
could
not
always
be
relied
upon
.
It
was
not
so
much
*NL*
that
he
failed
to
grasp
certain
reforms
enacted
during
the
present
reign
,
*NL*
as
that
he
made
conspicuous
blunders
in
his
interpretation
of
them
.
This
*NL*
was
not
from
any
special
lack
of
intelligence
,
but
from
carelessness
,
for
*NL*
he
was
always
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
go
into
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
heart
of
a
soldier
rather
than
of
a
civilian
,
''
he
used
to
say
*NL*
of
himself
.
He
had
not
even
formed
a
definite
idea
of
the
fundamental
*NL*
principles
of
the
reforms
connected
with
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
,
*NL*
and
only
picked
it
up
,
so
to
speak
,
from
year
to
year
,
involuntarily
*NL*
increasing
his
knowledge
by
practice
.
And
yet
he
was
himself
a
landowner
.
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
knew
for
certain
that
he
would
meet
some
of
Mihail
*NL*
Makarovitch
's
visitors
there
that
evening
,
but
he
did
n't
know
which
.
As
it
*NL*
happened
,
at
that
moment
the
prosecutor
,
and
Varvinsky
,
our
district
*NL*
doctor
,
a
young
man
,
who
had
only
just
come
to
us
from
Petersburg
after
*NL*
taking
a
brilliant
degree
at
the
Academy
of
Medicine
,
were
playing
whist
*NL*
at
the
police
captain
's
.
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
,
the
prosecutor
-LRB-
he
was
*NL*
really
the
deputy
prosecutor
,
but
we
always
called
him
the
prosecutor
-RRB-
,
*NL*
was
rather
a
peculiar
man
,
of
about
five
and
thirty
,
inclined
to
be
*NL*
consumptive
,
and
married
to
a
fat
and
childless
woman
.
He
was
vain
and
*NL*
irritable
,
though
he
had
a
good
intellect
,
and
even
a
kind
heart
.
It
*NL*
seemed
that
all
that
was
wrong
with
him
was
that
he
had
a
better
opinion
*NL*
of
himself
than
his
ability
warranted
.
And
that
made
him
seem
constantly
*NL*
uneasy
.
He
had
,
moreover
,
certain
higher
,
even
artistic
,
leanings
,
towards
*NL*
psychology
,
for
instance
,
a
special
study
of
the
human
heart
,
a
special
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
criminal
and
his
crime
.
He
cherished
a
grievance
on
this
*NL*
ground
,
considering
that
he
had
been
passed
over
in
the
service
,
and
being
*NL*
firmly
persuaded
that
in
higher
spheres
he
had
not
been
properly
*NL*
appreciated
,
and
had
enemies
.
In
gloomy
moments
he
even
threatened
to
give
*NL*
up
his
post
,
and
practice
as
a
barrister
in
criminal
cases
.
The
unexpected
*NL*
Karamazov
case
agitated
him
profoundly
:
``
It
was
a
case
that
might
well
be
*NL*
talked
about
all
over
Russia
.
''
But
I
am
anticipating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
Nelyudov
,
the
young
investigating
lawyer
,
who
had
*NL*
only
come
from
Petersburg
two
months
before
,
was
sitting
in
the
next
room
*NL*
with
the
young
ladies
.
People
talked
about
it
afterwards
and
wondered
that
*NL*
all
the
gentlemen
should
,
as
though
intentionally
,
on
the
evening
of
``
the
*NL*
crime
''
have
been
gathered
together
at
the
house
of
the
executive
*NL*
authority
.
Yet
it
was
perfectly
simple
and
happened
quite
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
's
wife
had
had
toothache
for
the
last
two
days
,
and
*NL*
he
was
obliged
to
go
out
to
escape
from
her
groans
.
The
doctor
,
from
the
*NL*
very
nature
of
his
being
,
could
not
spend
an
evening
except
at
cards
.
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
Nelyudov
had
been
intending
for
three
days
past
to
*NL*
drop
in
that
evening
at
Mihail
Makarovitch
's
,
so
to
speak
casually
,
so
as
*NL*
slyly
to
startle
the
eldest
granddaughter
,
Olga
Mihailovna
,
by
showing
*NL*
that
he
knew
her
secret
,
that
he
knew
it
was
her
birthday
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
trying
to
conceal
it
on
purpose
,
so
as
not
to
be
obliged
to
give
a
*NL*
dance
.
He
anticipated
a
great
deal
of
merriment
,
many
playful
jests
about
*NL*
her
age
,
and
her
being
afraid
to
reveal
it
,
about
his
knowing
her
secret
*NL*
and
telling
everybody
,
and
so
on
.
The
charming
young
man
was
a
great
adept
*NL*
at
such
teasing
;
the
ladies
had
christened
him
``
the
naughty
man
,
''
and
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
delighted
at
the
name
.
He
was
extremely
well-bred
,
however
,
*NL*
of
good
family
,
education
and
feelings
,
and
,
though
leading
a
life
of
*NL*
pleasure
,
his
sallies
were
always
innocent
and
in
good
taste
.
He
was
*NL*
short
,
and
delicate-looking
.
On
his
white
,
slender
,
little
fingers
he
*NL*
always
wore
a
number
of
big
,
glittering
rings
.
When
he
was
engaged
in
his
*NL*
official
duties
,
he
always
became
extraordinarily
grave
,
as
though
*NL*
realizing
his
position
and
the
sanctity
of
the
obligations
laid
upon
him
.
*NL*
He
had
a
special
gift
for
mystifying
murderers
and
other
criminals
of
the
*NL*
peasant
class
during
interrogation
,
and
if
he
did
not
win
their
respect
,
*NL*
he
certainly
succeeded
in
arousing
their
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
simply
dumbfounded
when
he
went
into
the
police
*NL*
captain
's
.
He
saw
instantly
that
every
one
knew
.
They
had
positively
*NL*
thrown
down
their
cards
,
all
were
standing
up
and
talking
.
Even
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
had
left
the
young
ladies
and
run
in
,
looking
strenuous
and
*NL*
ready
for
action
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
met
with
the
astounding
news
that
old
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
really
had
been
murdered
that
evening
in
his
own
house
,
*NL*
murdered
and
robbed
.
The
news
had
only
just
reached
them
in
the
following
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marfa
Ignatyevna
,
the
wife
of
old
Grigory
,
who
had
been
knocked
senseless
*NL*
near
the
fence
,
was
sleeping
soundly
in
her
bed
and
might
well
have
slept
*NL*
till
morning
after
the
draught
she
had
taken
.
But
,
all
of
a
sudden
she
*NL*
waked
up
,
no
doubt
roused
by
a
fearful
epileptic
scream
from
Smerdyakov
,
*NL*
who
was
lying
in
the
next
room
unconscious
.
That
scream
always
preceded
*NL*
his
fits
,
and
always
terrified
and
upset
Marfa
Ignatyevna
.
She
could
never
*NL*
get
accustomed
to
it
.
She
jumped
up
and
ran
half-awake
to
Smerdyakov
's
*NL*
room
.
But
it
was
dark
there
,
and
she
could
only
hear
the
invalid
beginning
*NL*
to
gasp
and
struggle
.
Then
Marfa
Ignatyevna
herself
screamed
out
and
was
*NL*
going
to
call
her
husband
,
but
suddenly
realized
that
when
she
had
got
up
,
*NL*
he
was
not
beside
her
in
bed
.
She
ran
back
to
the
bedstead
and
began
*NL*
groping
with
her
hands
,
but
the
bed
was
really
empty
.
Then
he
must
have
*NL*
gone
out
--
where
?
She
ran
to
the
steps
and
timidly
called
him
.
She
got
no
*NL*
answer
,
of
course
,
but
she
caught
the
sound
of
groans
far
away
in
the
*NL*
garden
in
the
darkness
.
She
listened
.
The
groans
were
repeated
,
and
it
was
*NL*
evident
they
came
from
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
Just
as
it
was
with
Lizaveta
Smerdyastchaya
!
''
she
thought
*NL*
distractedly
.
She
went
timidly
down
the
steps
and
saw
that
the
gate
into
*NL*
the
garden
was
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
be
out
there
,
poor
dear
,
''
she
thought
.
She
went
up
to
the
gate
*NL*
and
all
at
once
she
distinctly
heard
Grigory
calling
her
by
name
,
``
Marfa
!
*NL*
Marfa
!
''
in
a
weak
,
moaning
,
dreadful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
preserve
us
from
harm
!
''
Marfa
Ignatyevna
murmured
,
and
ran
towards
*NL*
the
voice
,
and
that
was
how
she
found
Grigory
.
But
she
found
him
not
by
*NL*
the
fence
where
he
had
been
knocked
down
,
but
about
twenty
paces
off
.
It
*NL*
appeared
later
,
that
he
had
crawled
away
on
coming
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
probably
had
been
a
long
time
getting
so
far
,
losing
consciousness
several
*NL*
times
.
She
noticed
at
once
that
he
was
covered
with
blood
,
and
screamed
at
*NL*
the
top
of
her
voice
.
Grigory
was
muttering
incoherently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
murdered
...
his
father
murdered
...
Why
scream
,
silly
...
run
...
*NL*
fetch
some
one
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marfa
continued
screaming
,
and
seeing
that
her
master
's
window
was
*NL*
open
and
that
there
was
a
candle
alight
in
the
window
,
she
ran
there
and
*NL*
began
calling
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
But
peeping
in
at
the
window
,
she
saw
a
*NL*
fearful
sight
.
Her
master
was
lying
on
his
back
,
motionless
,
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
His
light-colored
dressing-gown
and
white
shirt
were
soaked
with
blood
.
*NL*
The
candle
on
the
table
brightly
lighted
up
the
blood
and
the
motionless
*NL*
dead
face
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
Terror-stricken
,
Marfa
rushed
away
from
*NL*
the
window
,
ran
out
of
the
garden
,
drew
the
bolt
of
the
big
gate
and
ran
*NL*
headlong
by
the
back
way
to
the
neighbor
,
Marya
Kondratyevna
.
Both
mother
*NL*
and
daughter
were
asleep
,
but
they
waked
up
at
Marfa
's
desperate
and
*NL*
persistent
screaming
and
knocking
at
the
shutter
.
Marfa
,
shrieking
and
*NL*
screaming
incoherently
,
managed
to
tell
them
the
main
fact
,
and
to
beg
for
*NL*
assistance
.
It
happened
that
Foma
had
come
back
from
his
wanderings
and
*NL*
was
staying
the
night
with
them
.
They
got
him
up
immediately
and
all
three
*NL*
ran
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
.
On
the
way
,
Marya
Kondratyevna
remembered
*NL*
that
at
about
eight
o'clock
she
heard
a
dreadful
scream
from
their
garden
,
*NL*
and
this
was
no
doubt
Grigory
's
scream
,
``
Parricide
!
''
uttered
when
he
*NL*
caught
hold
of
Mitya
's
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
person
screamed
out
and
then
was
silent
,
''
Marya
Kondratyevna
*NL*
explained
as
she
ran
.
Running
to
the
place
where
Grigory
lay
,
the
two
*NL*
women
with
the
help
of
Foma
carried
him
to
the
lodge
.
They
lighted
a
*NL*
candle
and
saw
that
Smerdyakov
was
no
better
,
that
he
was
writhing
in
*NL*
convulsions
,
his
eyes
fixed
in
a
squint
,
and
that
foam
was
flowing
from
*NL*
his
lips
.
They
moistened
Grigory
's
forehead
with
water
mixed
with
vinegar
,
*NL*
and
the
water
revived
him
at
once
.
He
asked
immediately
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
master
murdered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Foma
and
both
the
women
ran
to
the
house
and
saw
this
time
that
not
*NL*
only
the
window
,
but
also
the
door
into
the
garden
was
wide
open
,
though
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
for
the
last
week
locked
himself
in
every
night
and
*NL*
did
not
allow
even
Grigory
to
come
in
on
any
pretext
.
Seeing
that
door
*NL*
open
,
they
were
afraid
to
go
in
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
``
for
fear
anything
*NL*
should
happen
afterwards
.
''
And
when
they
returned
to
Grigory
,
the
old
man
*NL*
told
them
to
go
straight
to
the
police
captain
.
Marya
Kondratyevna
ran
*NL*
there
and
gave
the
alarm
to
the
whole
party
at
the
police
captain
's
.
She
*NL*
arrived
only
five
minutes
before
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
so
that
his
story
came
,
*NL*
not
as
his
own
surmise
and
theory
,
but
as
the
direct
confirmation
,
by
a
*NL*
witness
,
of
the
theory
held
by
all
,
as
to
the
identity
of
the
criminal
-LRB-
a
*NL*
theory
he
had
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
refused
to
believe
till
that
*NL*
moment
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
resolved
to
act
with
energy
.
The
deputy
police
inspector
of
the
*NL*
town
was
commissioned
to
take
four
witnesses
,
to
enter
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
house
and
there
to
open
an
inquiry
on
the
spot
,
according
to
the
regular
*NL*
forms
,
which
I
will
not
go
into
here
.
The
district
doctor
,
a
zealous
man
,
*NL*
new
to
his
work
,
almost
insisted
on
accompanying
the
police
captain
,
the
*NL*
prosecutor
,
and
the
investigating
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
note
briefly
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
found
to
be
quite
dead
,
*NL*
with
his
skull
battered
in
.
But
with
what
?
Most
likely
with
the
same
*NL*
weapon
with
which
Grigory
had
been
attacked
.
And
immediately
that
weapon
*NL*
was
found
,
Grigory
,
to
whom
all
possible
medical
assistance
was
at
once
*NL*
given
,
described
in
a
weak
and
breaking
voice
how
he
had
been
knocked
*NL*
down
.
They
began
looking
with
a
lantern
by
the
fence
and
found
the
brass
*NL*
pestle
dropped
in
a
most
conspicuous
place
on
the
garden
path
.
There
were
*NL*
no
signs
of
disturbance
in
the
room
where
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
was
lying
.
But
*NL*
by
the
bed
,
behind
the
screen
,
they
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
big
and
*NL*
thick
envelope
with
the
inscription
:
``
A
present
of
three
thousand
roubles
*NL*
for
my
angel
Grushenka
,
if
she
is
willing
to
come
.
''
And
below
had
been
*NL*
added
by
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
``
For
my
little
chicken
.
''
There
were
three
*NL*
seals
of
red
sealing-wax
on
the
envelope
,
but
it
had
been
torn
open
and
*NL*
was
empty
:
the
money
had
been
removed
.
They
found
also
on
the
floor
a
*NL*
piece
of
narrow
pink
ribbon
,
with
which
the
envelope
had
been
tied
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
piece
of
Pyotr
Ilyitch
's
evidence
made
a
great
impression
on
the
*NL*
prosecutor
and
the
investigating
magistrate
,
namely
,
his
idea
that
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
would
shoot
himself
before
daybreak
,
that
he
had
resolved
to
*NL*
do
so
,
had
spoken
of
it
to
Ilyitch
,
had
taken
the
pistols
,
loaded
them
*NL*
before
him
,
written
a
letter
,
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
etc.
.
When
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
,
though
still
unwilling
to
believe
in
it
,
threatened
to
tell
some
*NL*
one
so
as
to
prevent
the
suicide
,
Mitya
had
answered
grinning
:
``
You
'll
be
*NL*
too
late
.
''
So
they
must
make
haste
to
Mokroe
to
find
the
criminal
,
before
*NL*
he
really
did
shoot
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
clear
,
that
's
clear
!
''
repeated
the
prosecutor
in
great
excitement
.
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
way
with
mad
fellows
like
that
:
'
I
shall
kill
myself
to
-
*NL*
morrow
,
so
I
'll
make
merry
till
I
die
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
how
he
had
bought
the
wine
and
provisions
excited
the
*NL*
prosecutor
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
the
fellow
that
murdered
a
merchant
called
Olsufyev
,
*NL*
gentlemen
?
He
stole
fifteen
hundred
,
went
at
once
to
have
his
hair
curled
,
*NL*
and
then
,
without
even
hiding
the
money
,
carrying
it
almost
in
his
hand
in
*NL*
the
same
way
,
he
went
off
to
the
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
delayed
,
however
,
by
the
inquiry
,
the
search
,
and
the
*NL*
formalities
,
etc.
,
in
the
house
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
It
all
took
time
and
*NL*
so
,
two
hours
before
starting
,
they
sent
on
ahead
to
Mokroe
the
officer
of
*NL*
the
rural
police
,
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
Schmertsov
,
who
had
arrived
in
the
*NL*
town
the
morning
before
to
get
his
pay
.
He
was
instructed
to
avoid
raising
*NL*
the
alarm
when
he
reached
Mokroe
,
but
to
keep
constant
watch
over
the
*NL*
``
criminal
''
till
the
arrival
of
the
proper
authorities
,
to
procure
also
*NL*
witnesses
for
the
arrest
,
police
constables
,
and
so
on
.
Mavriky
*NL*
Mavrikyevitch
did
as
he
was
told
,
preserving
his
incognito
,
and
giving
no
*NL*
one
but
his
old
acquaintance
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
the
slightest
hint
of
*NL*
his
secret
business
.
He
had
spoken
to
him
just
before
Mitya
met
the
*NL*
landlord
in
the
balcony
,
looking
for
him
in
the
dark
,
and
noticed
at
once
*NL*
a
change
in
Trifon
Borissovitch
's
face
and
voice
.
So
neither
Mitya
nor
any
*NL*
one
else
knew
that
he
was
being
watched
.
The
box
with
the
pistols
had
been
*NL*
carried
off
by
Trifon
Borissovitch
and
put
in
a
suitable
place
.
Only
after
*NL*
four
o'clock
,
almost
at
sunrise
,
all
the
officials
,
the
police
captain
,
*NL*
the
prosecutor
,
the
investigating
lawyer
,
drove
up
in
two
carriages
,
each
*NL*
drawn
by
three
horses
.
The
doctor
remained
at
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
to
make
*NL*
a
post-mortem
next
day
on
the
body
.
But
he
was
particularly
interested
in
*NL*
the
condition
of
the
servant
,
Smerdyakov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
violent
and
protracted
epileptic
fits
,
recurring
continually
for
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
,
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
,
and
are
of
interest
to
*NL*
science
,
''
he
declared
enthusiastically
to
his
companions
,
and
as
they
left
*NL*
they
laughingly
congratulated
him
on
his
find
.
The
prosecutor
and
the
*NL*
investigating
lawyer
distinctly
remembered
the
doctor
's
saying
that
*NL*
Smerdyakov
could
not
outlive
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
long
,
but
I
think
necessary
explanations
,
we
will
return
to
*NL*
that
moment
of
our
tale
at
which
we
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
III
.
The
Sufferings
Of
A
Soul
,
The
First
Ordeal
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Mitya
sat
looking
wildly
at
the
people
round
him
,
not
understanding
*NL*
what
was
said
to
him
.
Suddenly
he
got
up
,
flung
up
his
hands
,
and
shouted
*NL*
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
guilty
!
I
'm
not
guilty
of
that
blood
!
I
'm
not
guilty
of
my
*NL*
father
's
blood
...
I
meant
to
kill
him
.
But
I
'm
not
guilty
.
Not
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
hardly
said
this
,
before
Grushenka
rushed
from
behind
the
*NL*
curtain
and
flung
herself
at
the
police
captain
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
fault
!
Mine
!
My
wickedness
!
''
she
cried
,
in
a
heartrending
*NL*
voice
,
bathed
in
tears
,
stretching
out
her
clasped
hands
towards
them
.
``
He
*NL*
did
it
through
me
.
I
tortured
him
and
drove
him
to
it
.
I
tortured
that
*NL*
poor
old
man
that
's
dead
,
too
,
in
my
wickedness
,
and
brought
him
to
this
!
*NL*
It
's
my
fault
,
mine
first
,
mine
most
,
my
fault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
your
fault
!
You
're
the
chief
criminal
!
You
fury
!
You
harlot
!
*NL*
You
're
the
most
to
blame
!
''
shouted
the
police
captain
,
threatening
her
*NL*
with
his
hand
.
But
he
was
quickly
and
resolutely
suppressed
.
The
*NL*
prosecutor
positively
seized
hold
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
absolutely
irregular
,
Mihail
Makarovitch
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
are
*NL*
positively
hindering
the
inquiry
...
You
're
ruining
the
case
...
''
he
*NL*
almost
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
the
regular
course
!
Follow
the
regular
course
!
''
cried
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
,
fearfully
excited
too
,
``
otherwise
it
's
absolutely
*NL*
impossible
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Judge
us
together
!
''
Grushenka
cried
frantically
,
still
kneeling
.
``
Punish
*NL*
us
together
.
I
will
go
with
him
now
,
if
it
's
to
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grusha
,
my
life
,
my
blood
,
my
holy
one
!
''
Mitya
fell
on
his
knees
beside
*NL*
her
and
held
her
tight
in
his
arms
.
``
Do
n't
believe
her
,
''
he
cried
,
``
she
's
*NL*
not
guilty
of
anything
,
of
any
blood
,
of
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
afterwards
that
he
was
forcibly
dragged
away
from
her
by
*NL*
several
men
,
and
that
she
was
led
out
,
and
that
when
he
recovered
himself
*NL*
he
was
sitting
at
the
table
.
Beside
him
and
behind
him
stood
the
men
with
*NL*
metal
plates
.
Facing
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
sat
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
,
the
investigating
lawyer
.
He
kept
persuading
him
to
drink
a
*NL*
little
water
out
of
a
glass
that
stood
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
refresh
you
,
that
will
calm
you
.
Be
calm
,
do
n't
be
frightened
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
extremely
politely
.
Mitya
-LRB-
he
remembered
it
afterwards
-RRB-
became
*NL*
suddenly
intensely
interested
in
his
big
rings
,
one
with
an
amethyst
,
and
*NL*
another
with
a
transparent
bright
yellow
stone
,
of
great
brilliance
.
And
*NL*
long
afterwards
he
remembered
with
wonder
how
those
rings
had
riveted
his
*NL*
attention
through
all
those
terrible
hours
of
interrogation
,
so
that
he
*NL*
was
utterly
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
them
and
dismiss
them
,
as
*NL*
things
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
position
.
On
Mitya
's
left
side
,
in
*NL*
the
place
where
Maximov
had
been
sitting
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
,
*NL*
the
prosecutor
was
now
seated
,
and
on
Mitya
's
right
hand
,
where
Grushenka
*NL*
had
been
,
was
a
rosy-cheeked
young
man
in
a
sort
of
shabby
hunting-jacket
,
*NL*
with
ink
and
paper
before
him
.
This
was
the
secretary
of
the
investigating
*NL*
lawyer
,
who
had
brought
him
with
him
.
The
police
captain
was
now
standing
*NL*
by
the
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
beside
Kalganov
,
who
was
*NL*
sitting
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
some
water
,
''
said
the
investigating
lawyer
softly
,
for
the
tenth
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
drunk
it
,
gentlemen
,
I
have
...
but
...
come
,
gentlemen
,
crush
me
,
*NL*
punish
me
,
decide
my
fate
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
staring
with
terribly
fixed
wide
-
*NL*
open
eyes
at
the
investigating
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
positively
declare
that
you
are
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
your
*NL*
father
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
?
''
asked
the
investigating
lawyer
,
softly
but
*NL*
insistently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
guilty
.
I
am
guilty
of
the
blood
of
another
old
man
but
not
of
*NL*
my
father
's
.
And
I
weep
for
it
!
I
killed
,
I
killed
the
old
man
and
knocked
*NL*
him
down
...
But
it
's
hard
to
have
to
answer
for
that
murder
with
another
,
*NL*
a
terrible
murder
of
which
I
am
not
guilty
...
It
's
a
terrible
accusation
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
a
knock-down
blow
.
But
who
has
killed
my
father
,
who
has
killed
*NL*
him
?
Who
can
have
killed
him
if
I
did
n't
?
It
's
marvelous
,
extraordinary
,
*NL*
impossible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
who
can
have
killed
him
?
''
the
investigating
lawyer
was
beginning
,
*NL*
but
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
,
the
prosecutor
,
glancing
at
him
,
addressed
*NL*
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
worry
yourself
about
the
old
servant

Grigory
Vassilyevitch

*NL*
He
is
alive

he
has
recovered
,
and
in
spite
of
the
terrible
blows
*NL*
inflicted
,
according
to
his
own
and
your
evidence
,
by
you
,
there
seems
no
*NL*
doubt
that
he
will
live
,
so
the
doctor
says
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alive
?
He
's
alive
?

cried
Mitya
,
flinging
up
his
hands
.
His
face
beamed
.
*NL*
``
Lord
,
I
thank
Thee
for
the
miracle
Thou
has
wrought

That
's
an
answer
to
my
prayer

I
've
been
praying
all
night

And
*NL*
he
crossed
himself
three
times
.
He
was
almost
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
from
this
Grigory
we
have
received
such
important
evidence
concerning

you

The
prosecutor
would
have
continued
,
but
Mitya
suddenly
jumped
*NL*
up
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
minute

gentlemen

for
God
's
sake

will
run
to

*NL*
``
Excuse
me

at
this
moment
it

quite
impossible

''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
*NL*
almost
shrieked
.
He
,
too
,
leapt
to
his
feet
.
Mitya
was
seized
by
the
men
*NL*
with
the
metal
plates
,
but
he
sat
down
of
his
own
accord
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

what
a
pity

I
wanted
to
see

gone

I
am
not

he
said
ecstatically
and
reverently

looking
round
at
them
all

``

the

began

*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
gentlemen
,
allow
me
one
minute
more
,
''
interposed
Mitya
,
putting
*NL*
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
.
``
Let
me
have
*NL*
a
moment
to
think
,
let
me
breathe
,
gentlemen
.
All
this
is
horribly
*NL*
upsetting
,
horribly

A

is
not

gentlemen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
a
little
more
water

''
murmured
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
took
his
hands
from
his
face
and
laughed
.
His
eyes
were
confident
.
*NL*
He
seemed
completely
transformed
in
a
moment
.
His
whole
bearing
was
*NL*
changed
;
he
was
once
more
the
equal
of
these
men
,
with
all
of
whom
he
was
*NL*
acquainted
,
as
though
they
had
all
met
the
day
before
,
when
nothing
had
*NL*
happened
,
at
some
social
gathering
.
We
may
note
in
passing
that
,
on
his
*NL*
first
arrival
,
Mitya
had
been
made
very
welcome
at
the
police
captain
's
,
*NL*
but
later
,
during
the
last
month
especially
,
Mitya
had
hardly
called
at
*NL*
all
,
and
when
the
police
captain
met
him
,
in
the
street
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
Mitya
noticed
that
he
frowned
and
only
bowed
out
of
politeness
.
His
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
prosecutor
was
less
intimate
,
though
he
sometimes
*NL*
paid
his
wife
,
a
nervous
and
fanciful
lady
,
visits
of
politeness
,
without
*NL*
quite
knowing
why
,
and
she
always
received
him
graciously
and
had
,
for
*NL*
some
reason
,
taken
an
interest
in
him
up
to
the
last
.
He
had
not
had
time
*NL*
to
get
to
know
the
investigating
lawyer
,
though
he
had
met
him
and
talked
*NL*
to
him
twice
,
each
time
about
the
fair
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
most
skillful
lawyer
,
I
see
,
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
''
cried
Mitya
,
*NL*
laughing
gayly
,
``
but
I
can
help
you
now
.
Oh
,
gentlemen
,
I
feel
like
a
new
*NL*
man
,
and
do
n't
be
offended
at
my
addressing
you
so
simply
and
directly
.
*NL*
I
'm
rather
drunk
,
too
,
I
'll
tell
you
that
frankly
.
I
believe
I
've
had
the
*NL*
honor
and
pleasure
of
meeting
you
,
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
at
my
kinsman
*NL*
Miuesov
's
.
Gentlemen

gentlemen
,
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
on
equal

you

I

of

in
what
character
I
am
sitting
before

*NL*
Oh

of
course
,
there
's
a
horrible
suspicion

hanging
over
me

*NL*
Grigory
has
given
evidence

A
horrible
suspicion

It

awful

awful

But
to

we
will
make

an

it

Since
I

we
can
put
an

it
in
a
minute

Ca
n't

Ca

we

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
spoke
much
and
quickly
,
nervously
and
effusively
,
as
though
he
*NL*
positively
took
his
listeners
to
be
his
best
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
for
the
present
,
we
will
write
that
you
absolutely
deny
the
charge
*NL*
brought
against
you

''
said
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
impressively
,
and
bending
*NL*
down
to
the
secretary
he
dictated
to
him
in
an
undertone
what
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
it
down

You
want
to
write
that
down

Well

my
full
consent

you

Stay

stay

*NL*
this
.
Of
disorderly
conduct
I
am
guilty

of
violence
on
a
poor
old
man

*NL*
am
guilty

And
there
is
something
else
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
of
which
*NL*
I
am
guilty
,
too
--
but
that
you
need
not
write
down

-LRB-
he
turned
suddenly
to
*NL*
the
secretary
-RRB-
;
``
that
's
my
personal
life
,
gentlemen
,
that
does
n't
concern
*NL*
you

the
bottom

that
's
to

But
of
the
murder

my
old

I
'm
not

That
's
a
wild

It

quite

will
prove

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
said
the
investigating
lawyer
evidently
*NL*
trying
to
allay
Mitya
's
excitement
by
his
own
composure
.
``
Before
we
go
on
*NL*
with
our
inquiry

I

like

statement
that

disliked
your

that
you
were
involved
in
continual
disputes
with
him

Here
at

least
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago

you
exclaimed
that
you
wanted
to
kill
*NL*
him
:

I
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

exclaim

Yes

unhappily

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wanted

you

for
your
parent

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
to
explain

''
Mitya
shrugged
his
shoulders
*NL*
sullenly
,
looking
down
.
``
I
have
never
concealed
my
feelings
.
All
the
town
*NL*
knows
about
it

every
one
knows
in

tavern
.
Only
lately
I
declared
them
*NL*
in
Father
Zossima
's
cell
...
And
the
very
same
day
,
in
the
evening
I
beat
*NL*
my
father
.
I
nearly
killed
him
,
and
I
swore
I
'd
come
again
and
kill
him

*NL*
before
witnesses

Oh

a

I
've
been
shouting
it
aloud
*NL*
for
the
last

one
can
tell
you
that

The
fact
stares
you
in
*NL*
the
face

it
speaks
for
itself
,
it
cries
aloud
,
but
feelings
,
gentlemen

*NL*
feelings
are
another
matter

You
see
,
gentlemen

--
Mitya
frowned
--
``
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
that
about
feelings
you
've
no
right
to
question
me

I
know
that
you
*NL*
are
bound
by
your
office

I
quite
understand
that

but
that
's
my
affair

*NL*
my
private

intimate
affair

concealed
my
feelings

past

in

I
've
talked

so
I

You
see

I
understand

gentlemen

*NL*
that
there
are
terrible
facts
against
me
in

business

I
told
every

one
that
I
'd
kill
him

and
now

all
of

he

I

myself

murdered
him

he
*NL*
exclaimed
suddenly

``
Where
was

murdered

How
was
he
murdered

How

and
*NL*
with
what

he
asked
quickly
,
looking
at
the
two
lawyers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
found
him
in

said
the
prosecutor

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

Mitya
shuddered
and
,
putting
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
*NL*
hid
his
face
in
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
continue

interposed
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
``
So
what
was
it
that
*NL*
impelled
you
to
this
sentiment
of
hatred
?
You
have
asserted
in
public
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
that
it
was
based
upon
jealousy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

yes

jealousy

And
not
only
jealousy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Disputes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

about
money

too

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
dispute
about
three
thousand
roubles

I
think

which
you

claimed
as
part

inheritance

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
thousand

More
,
more
,
''
cried
Mitya
hotly
;
``
more
than
six
thousand
,
*NL*
more
than
ten

perhaps

I
told
every
one
so
,
shouted
it
at
them

But
I
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
to
let
it
go
at
three
thousand

I
was
desperately
in
need
*NL*
of
that
three
thousand

bundle
of
notes
for
three
thousand

knew

kept
under

ready

I
considered
as

simply
stolen
from

looked
upon

mine

as

*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
looked
significantly
at
the
investigating
lawyer
,
and
had
*NL*
time
to
wink
at
him
on
the
sly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
return
to
that
subject
later

said
the
lawyer
promptly
.
``
You
*NL*
will
allow
us
to
note
that
point

down

money
as
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Write

I
'm
not
afraid
of
facts

I
tell
them
against
myself

Do

you
hear

Do
you
know

gentlemen

you
take
me
for
a
different
sort
of
man
*NL*
from
what
I
am

he
added
,
suddenly
gloomy
and
dejected
.
``
You
have
to
deal

with
a
man

honor

a
man
of
the
highest
honor

above
all

do
n't
lose
*NL*
sight
of
it

a
man
who

done
a

nasty
things

but
has
always
been

*NL*
and
still
is

honorable
at

in

inner
being

I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
express
it

That
's
just
what
's
made
me
wretched
all
my
life

I
*NL*
yearned
to
be
honorable

that
I
was

so
to

a
martyr

a
sense

seeking
for

with

His
brows
contracted
with
pain

could
n't

look

ignoble

impudent

trampling
on
everything
sacred

something
sneering

*NL*
irreverent

loathsome

``
How

I

mean

Write

''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
this
Mitya
became
very
mournful
.
He
had
grown
more
and
more
gloomy
*NL*
as
the
inquiry
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
another
unexpected
scene
followed
.
Though
Grushenka
had
*NL*
been
removed
,
she
had
not
been
taken
far
away
,
only
into
the
room
next
but
*NL*
one
from
the
blue
room
,
in
which
the
examination
was
proceeding
.
It
was
a
*NL*
little
room
with
one
window
,
next
beyond
the
large
room
in
which
they
had
*NL*
danced
and
feasted
so
lavishly
.
She
was
sitting
there
with
no
one
by
her
*NL*
but
Maximov
,
who
was
terribly
depressed
,
terribly
scared
,
and
clung
to
her
*NL*
side
,
as
though
for
security
.
At
their
door
stood
one
of
the
peasants
with
*NL*
a
metal
plate
on
his
breast
.
Grushenka
was
crying
,
and
suddenly
her
grief
*NL*
was
too
much
for
her
,
she
jumped
up
,
flung
up
her
arms
and
,
with
a
loud
*NL*
wail
of
sorrow
,
rushed
out
of
the
room
to
him
,
to
her
Mitya
,
and
so
*NL*
unexpectedly
that
they
had
not
time
to
stop
her
.
Mitya
,
hearing
her
cry
,
*NL*
trembled
,
jumped
up
,
and
with
a
yell
rushed
impetuously
to
meet
her
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
he
was
doing
.
But
they
were
not
allowed
to
come
together
,
*NL*
though
they
saw
one
another
.
He
was
seized
by
the
arms
.
He
struggled
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
tear
himself
away
.
It
took
three
or
four
men
to
hold
him
.
She
was
*NL*
seized
too
,
and
he
saw
her
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
,
crying
aloud
as
*NL*
they
carried
her
away
.
When
the
scene
was
over
,
he
came
to
himself
again
,
*NL*
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
before
,
opposite
the
investigating
lawyer
,
*NL*
and
crying
out
to
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
with
her
?
Why
do
you
torment
her
?
She
's
done
nothing
,
*NL*
nothing
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyers
tried
to
soothe
him
.
About
ten
minutes
passed
like
this
.
At
*NL*
last
Mihail
Makarovitch
,
who
had
been
absent
,
came
hurriedly
into
the
*NL*
room
,
and
said
in
a
loud
and
excited
voice
to
the
prosecutor
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
removed
,
she
's
downstairs
.
Will
you
allow
me
to
say
one
word
*NL*
to
this
unhappy
man
,
gentlemen
?
In
your
presence
,
gentlemen
,
in
your
*NL*
presence

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
Mihail
Makarovitch

answered
the
investigating
lawyer
.
``
In
*NL*
the
present
case
we
have
nothing
against
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
began
the
police
captain
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
look
of
warm
,
almost
fatherly
,
feeling
for
the
luckless
*NL*
prisoner
on
his
excited
face
.
``
I
took
your
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
*NL*
downstairs
myself
,
and
confided
her
to
the
care
of
the
landlord
's
*NL*
daughters
,
and
that
old
fellow
Maximov
is
with
her
all
the
time
.
And
I
*NL*
soothed
her
,
do
you
hear
?
I
soothed
and
calmed
her
.
I
impressed
on
her
*NL*
that
you
have
to
clear
yourself
,
so
she
must
n't
hinder
you
,
must
not
*NL*
depress
you
,
or
you
may
lose
your
head
and
say
the
wrong
thing
in
your
*NL*
evidence
.
In
fact
,
I
talked
to
her
and
she
understood
.
She
's
a
sensible
*NL*
girl
,
my
boy
,
a
good-hearted
girl
,
she
would
have
kissed
my
old
hands
,
*NL*
begging
help
for
you
.
She
sent
me
herself
,
to
tell
you
not
to
worry
about
*NL*
her
.
And
I
must
go
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
must
go
and
tell
her
that
you
are
*NL*
calm
and
comforted
about
her
.
And
so
you
must
be
calm
,
do
you
understand
?
*NL*
I
was
unfair
to
her
;
she
is
a
Christian
soul
,
gentlemen
,
yes
,
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
she
's
a
gentle
soul
,
and
not
to
blame
for
anything
.
So
what
am
I
to
tell
*NL*
her
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
?
Will
you
sit
quiet
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
good-natured
police
captain
said
a
great
deal
that
was
irregular
,
but
*NL*
Grushenka
's
suffering
,
a
fellow
creature
's
suffering
,
touched
his
good
-
*NL*
natured
heart
,
and
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
.
Mitya
jumped
up
and
rushed
*NL*
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
gentlemen
,
oh
,
allow
me
,
allow
me

he
cried
.
``
You

I

quite

that
I
shall
be
laughing
in

knowing

a
guardian
angel
like

I
shall
have
done

with
all
this
directly

and
as
soon
as
I

I
'll
be
with

she

*NL*

let
her
wait

Gentlemen

''
he
said
,
turning
to
the
two
lawyers
,
``
now
*NL*
I
'll
open
my
whole
soul

But

gentlemen

that

is
the
queen

*NL*
tell

that

That

I
see
I

with
*NL*
honorable

She
is
my
light

she
is
my
holy
one

if

Did
you
hear
her
cry

go
to
death
with

And
what
have
I

a
*NL*
penniless

done
for

Why
such
love

How
can

ugly
brute
like

with
my
ugly
face

deserve
such
love

that
she
is

go
to
exile
with

how
she
fell
down
at
your
feet
for
my
*NL*
sake

just
now

she
's
proud
and
has
done
nothing

How

I
*NL*
help
adoring
her
,
how
can
I
help
crying
out
and
rushing
to
her
as
I
did
*NL*
just
now

Gentlemen

forgive
me

But
now

now
I

comforted

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
burst
*NL*
into
tears
.
But
they
were
happy
tears
.
He
recovered
himself
instantly
.
The
*NL*
old
police
captain
seemed
much
pleased
,
and
the
lawyers
also
.
They
felt
*NL*
that
the
examination
was
passing
into
a
new
phase
.
When
the
police
captain
*NL*
went
out
,
Mitya
was
positively
gay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
I
am
at
your
disposal

entirely
at
your
disposal

And
if
*NL*
it
were
not
for
all
these
trivial
details
,
we
should
understand
one
*NL*
another
in
a
minute
.
I
'm
at
those
details
again
.
I
'm
at
your
disposal
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
but
I
declare
that
we
must
have
mutual
confidence

you
in

I
in
you

there
'll
be
no

to
it

I
speak
in
your

To
*NL*
business

gentlemen

to
business

and
do
n't
rummage
in
my
soul

do
n't
*NL*
tease
me
with
trifles
,
but
only
ask
me
about
facts

what
matters

I
*NL*
will
satisfy
you
at
once

damn
the

*NL*
So
spoke
Mitya

The
interrogation
began
again

Chapter
IV
.
The
Second
Ordeal
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
how
you
encourage
us
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
by
your
*NL*
readiness
to
answer
,
''
said
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
with
an
animated
air
,
and
*NL*
obvious
satisfaction
beaming
in
his
very
prominent
,
short-sighted
,
light
*NL*
gray
eyes
,
from
which
he
had
removed
his
spectacles
a
moment
before
.
``
And
*NL*
you
have
made
a
very
just
remark
about
the
mutual
confidence
,
without
*NL*
which
it
is
sometimes
positively
impossible
to
get
on
in
cases
of
such
*NL*
importance
,
if
the
suspected
party
really
hopes
and
desires
to
defend
*NL*
himself
and
is
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
We
,
on
our
side
,
will
do
everything
*NL*
in
our
power
,
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
we
are
conducting
the
case
.
*NL*
You
approve
,
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
?
''
He
turned
to
the
prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
undoubtedly
,
''
replied
the
prosecutor
.
His
tone
was
somewhat
cold
,
*NL*
compared
with
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
's
impulsiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
note
once
for
all
that
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
who
had
but
lately
*NL*
arrived
among
us
,
had
from
the
first
felt
marked
respect
for
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
,
our
prosecutor
,
and
had
become
almost
his
bosom
friend
.
He
*NL*
was
almost
the
only
person
who
put
implicit
faith
in
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
's
extraordinary
talents
as
a
psychologist
and
orator
and
in
*NL*
the
justice
of
his
grievance
.
He
had
heard
of
him
in
Petersburg
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
young
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
was
the
only
person
in
the
whole
*NL*
world
whom
our
``
unappreciated
''
prosecutor
genuinely
liked
.
On
their
way
to
*NL*
Mokroe
they
had
time
to
come
to
an
understanding
about
the
present
case
.
*NL*
And
now
as
they
sat
at
the
table
,
the
sharp-witted
junior
caught
and
*NL*
interpreted
every
indication
on
his
senior
colleague
's
face
--
half
a
word
,
a
*NL*
glance
,
or
a
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
only
let
me
tell
my
own
story
and
do
n't
interrupt
me
with
*NL*
trivial
questions
and
I
'll
tell
you
everything
in
a
moment
,
''
said
Mitya
*NL*
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
!
Thank
you
.
But
before
we
proceed
to
listen
to
your
*NL*
communication
,
will
you
allow
me
to
inquire
as
to
another
little
fact
of
*NL*
great
interest
to
us
?
I
mean
the
ten
roubles
you
borrowed
yesterday
at
*NL*
about
five
o'clock
on
the
security
of
your
pistols
,
from
your
friend
,
*NL*
Pyotr
Ilyitch
Perhotin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pledged
them
,
gentlemen
.
I
pledged
them
for
ten
roubles
.
What
more
?
*NL*
That
's
all
about
it
.
As
soon
as
I
got
back
to
town
I
pledged
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
got
back
to
town
?
Then
you
had
been
out
of
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
went
a
journey
of
forty
versts
into
the
country
.
Did
n't
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
and
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
exchanged
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
would
it
be
if
you
began
your
story
with
a
systematic
*NL*
description
of
all
you
did
yesterday
,
from
the
morning
onwards
?
Allow
us
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
to
inquire
why
you
were
absent
from
the
town
,
and
just
when
*NL*
you
left
and
when
you
came
back
--
all
those
facts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
asked
me
like
that
from
the
beginning
,
''
cried
Mitya
,
*NL*
laughing
aloud
,
``
and
,
if
you
like
,
we
wo
n't
begin
from
yesterday
,
but
from
*NL*
the
morning
of
the
day
before
;
then
you
'll
understand
how
,
why
,
and
where
*NL*
I
went
.
I
went
the
day
before
yesterday
,
gentlemen
,
to
a
merchant
of
the
*NL*
town
,
called
Samsonov
,
to
borrow
three
thousand
roubles
from
him
on
safe
*NL*
security
.
It
was
a
pressing
matter
,
gentlemen
,
it
was
a
sudden
necessity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
interrupt
you
,
''
the
prosecutor
put
in
politely
.
``
Why
were
you
*NL*
in
such
pressing
need
for
just
that
sum
,
three
thousand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
gentlemen
,
you
need
n't
go
into
details
,
how
,
when
and
why
,
and
why
*NL*
just
so
much
money
,
and
not
so
much
,
and
all
that
rigmarole
.
Why
,
it
'll
*NL*
run
to
three
volumes
,
and
then
you
'll
want
an
epilogue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
said
all
this
with
the
good-natured
but
impatient
familiarity
of
a
*NL*
man
who
is
anxious
to
tell
the
whole
truth
and
is
full
of
the
best
*NL*
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
!
''
--
he
corrected
himself
hurriedly
--
``
do
n't
be
vexed
with
me
for
my
*NL*
restiveness
,
I
beg
you
again
.
Believe
me
once
more
,
I
feel
the
greatest
*NL*
respect
for
you
and
understand
the
true
position
of
affairs
.
Do
n't
think
*NL*
I
'm
drunk
.
I
'm
quite
sober
now
.
And
,
besides
,
being
drunk
would
be
no
*NL*
hindrance
.
It
's
with
me
,
you
know
,
like
the
saying
:
`
When
he
is
sober
,
he
*NL*
is
a
fool
;
when
he
is
drunk
,
he
is
a
wise
man
.
'
Ha
ha
!
But
I
see
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
it
's
not
the
proper
thing
to
make
jokes
to
you
,
till
we
've
had
*NL*
our
explanation
,
I
mean
.
And
I
've
my
own
dignity
to
keep
up
,
too
.
I
quite
*NL*
understand
the
difference
for
the
moment
.
I
am
,
after
all
,
in
the
position
*NL*
of
a
criminal
,
and
so
,
far
from
being
on
equal
terms
with
you
.
And
it
's
*NL*
your
business
to
watch
me
.
I
ca
n't
expect
you
to
pat
me
on
the
head
for
*NL*
what
I
did
to
Grigory
,
for
one
ca
n't
break
old
men
's
heads
with
impunity
.
*NL*
I
suppose
you
'll
put
me
away
for
him
for
six
months
,
or
a
year
perhaps
,
in
*NL*
a
house
of
correction
.
I
do
n't
know
what
the
punishment
is
--
but
it
will
be
*NL*
without
loss
of
the
rights
of
my
rank
,
without
loss
of
my
rank
,
wo
n't
it
?
*NL*
So
you
see
,
gentlemen
,
I
understand
the
distinction
between
us
...
But
you
*NL*
must
see
that
you
could
puzzle
God
Himself
with
such
questions
.
`
How
did
*NL*
you
step
?
Where
did
you
step
?
When
did
you
step
?
And
on
what
did
you
*NL*
step
?
'
I
shall
get
mixed
up
,
if
you
go
on
like
this
,
and
you
will
put
it
*NL*
all
down
against
me
.
And
what
will
that
lead
to
?
To
nothing
!
And
even
if
*NL*
it
's
nonsense
I
'm
talking
now
,
let
me
finish
,
and
you
,
gentlemen
,
being
*NL*
men
of
honor
and
refinement
,
will
forgive
me
!
I
'll
finish
by
asking
you
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
to
drop
that
conventional
method
of
questioning
.
I
mean
,
*NL*
beginning
from
some
miserable
trifle
,
how
I
got
up
,
what
I
had
for
*NL*
breakfast
,
how
I
spat
,
and
where
I
spat
,
and
so
distracting
the
attention
*NL*
of
the
criminal
,
suddenly
stun
him
with
an
overwhelming
question
,
`
Whom
*NL*
did
you
murder
?
Whom
did
you
rob
?
'
Ha
ha
!
That
's
your
regulation
method
,
*NL*
that
's
where
all
your
cunning
comes
in
.
You
can
put
peasants
off
their
*NL*
guard
like
that
,
but
not
me
.
I
know
the
tricks
.
I
've
been
in
the
service
,
*NL*
too
.
Ha
ha
ha
!
You
're
not
angry
,
gentlemen
?
You
forgive
my
impertinence
?
''
*NL*
he
cried
,
looking
at
them
with
a
good-nature
that
was
almost
surprising
.
*NL*
``
It
's
only
Mitya
Karamazov
,
you
know
,
so
you
can
overlook
it

It
would
be

inexcusable
in
a
sensible
man
;
but
you
can
forgive
it
in
Mitya
.
Ha
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
listened
,
and
laughed
too
.
Though
the
prosecutor
did
*NL*
not
laugh
,
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
keenly
on
Mitya
,
as
though
anxious
not
*NL*
to
miss
the
least
syllable
,
the
slightest
movement
,
the
smallest
twitch
of
*NL*
any
feature
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
we
have
treated
you
from
the
beginning

''
said
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
,
still
laughing
.
``
We
have
n't
tried
to
put
you
out
by
asking
*NL*
how
you
got
up
in
the
morning
and
what
you
had
for
breakfast
.
We
began
,
*NL*
indeed
,
with
questions
of
the
greatest
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
.
I
saw
it
and
appreciated
it
,
and
I
appreciate
still
more
*NL*
your
present
kindness
to
me
,
an
unprecedented
kindness
,
worthy
of
your
*NL*
noble
hearts
.
We
three
here
are
gentlemen
,
and
let
everything
be
on
the
*NL*
footing
of
mutual
confidence
between
educated
,
well-bred
people
,
who
have
*NL*
the
common
bond
of
noble
birth
and
honor
.
In
any
case
,
allow
me
to
look
*NL*
upon
you
as
my
best
friends
at
this
moment
of
my
life
,
at
this
moment
when
*NL*
my
honor
is
assailed
.
That
's
no
offense
to
you
,
gentlemen
,
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
.
You
've
expressed
all
that
so
well

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
answered
with
dignified
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
enough
of
those
trivial
questions
,
gentlemen
,
all
those
tricky
*NL*
questions
!
''
cried
Mitya
enthusiastically
.
``
Or
there
's
simply
no
knowing
*NL*
where
we
shall
get
to
!
Is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
follow
your
sensible
advice
entirely
,
''
the
prosecutor
interposed
,
*NL*
addressing
Mitya
.
``
I
do
n't
withdraw
my
question
,
however
.
It
is
now
*NL*
vitally
important
for
us
to
know
exactly
why
you
needed
that
sum
,
I
mean
*NL*
precisely
three
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
I
needed
it
?
...
Oh
,
for
one
thing
and
another
...
Well
,
it
was
to
pay
*NL*
a
debt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
debt
to
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
absolutely
refuse
to
answer

gentlemen

Not
because
I
could
n't
,
or
*NL*
because
I
should
n't
dare
,
or
because
it
would
be
damaging
,
for
it
's
all
a
*NL*
paltry
matter
and
absolutely
trifling
,
but
--
I
wo
n't
,
because
it
's
a

that
's
my
private
life
,
and
I
wo
n't
allow
any
intrusion
into
*NL*
my
private
life

That

my
principle

Your
question
has
no
bearing
on
the
*NL*
case
,
and
whatever
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
is
my
private
affair

I
*NL*
wanted
to
pay
a
debt

I
wanted
to
pay
a
debt
of
honor
but
to
whom
I
wo

*NL*
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
make
a
note
of
that

said
the
prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means

Write
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow

once

you

it

the
prosecutor
began
,
with
a
peculiar
and
stern
*NL*
impressiveness
,
``
that
you
have
a
perfect
right
not

decline
to
give
it
for
one
reason

That
is
entirely
*NL*
a
matter
for
your
personal
decision
.
But
it
is
our
duty
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
in
such
cases
as
the
present
,
to
explain
and
set
before
you
the
*NL*
degree
of
injury
you
will
be
doing
yourself
by
refusing
to
give
this
or
*NL*
that
piece
of
evidence

After
which
I
will
beg
you
to
continue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
I
'm
not
angry
...
I
...
''
Mitya
muttered
in
a
rather
*NL*
disconcerted
tone
.
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
you
see
,
that
Samsonov
to
whom
I
went
*NL*
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
,
of
course
,
not
reproduce
his
account
of
what
is
known
to
the
*NL*
reader
already
.
Mitya
was
impatiently
anxious
not
to
omit
the
slightest
*NL*
detail
.
At
the
same
time
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
it
over
.
But
as
he
gave
*NL*
his
evidence
it
was
written
down
,
and
therefore
they
had
continually
to
*NL*
pull
him
up
.
Mitya
disliked
this
,
but
submitted
;
got
angry
,
though
still
*NL*
good-humoredly
.
He
did
,
it
is
true
,
exclaim
,
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
that
's
enough
to
make
an
angel
out
of
patience
!
''
Or
,
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
it
's
no
good
your
irritating
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
though
he
exclaimed
he
still
preserved
for
a
time
his
genially
*NL*
expansive
mood
.
So
he
told
them
how
Samsonov
had
made
a
fool
of
him
two
*NL*
days
before
.
-LRB-
He
had
completely
realized
by
now
that
he
had
been
fooled
.
-RRB-
*NL*
The
sale
of
his
watch
for
six
roubles
to
obtain
money
for
the
journey
was
*NL*
something
new
to
the
lawyers
.
They
were
at
once
greatly
interested
,
and
*NL*
even
,
to
Mitya
's
intense
indignation
,
thought
it
necessary
to
write
the
*NL*
fact
down
as
a
secondary
confirmation
of
the
circumstance
that
he
had
*NL*
hardly
a
farthing
in
his
pocket
at
the
time
.
Little
by
little
Mitya
began
*NL*
to
grow
surly
.
Then
,
after
describing
his
journey
to
see
Lyagavy
,
the
*NL*
night
spent
in
the
stifling
hut
,
and
so
on
,
he
came
to
his
return
to
the
*NL*
town
.
Here
he
began
,
without
being
particularly
urged
,
to
give
a
minute
*NL*
account
of
the
agonies
of
jealousy
he
endured
on
Grushenka
's
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
heard
with
silent
attention
.
They
inquired
particularly
into
the
*NL*
circumstance
of
his
having
a
place
of
ambush
in
Marya
Kondratyevna
's
house
*NL*
at
the
back
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
garden
to
keep
watch
on
Grushenka
,
and
*NL*
of
Smerdyakov
's
bringing
him
information
.
They
laid
particular
stress
on
*NL*
this
,
and
noted
it
down
.
Of
his
jealousy
he
spoke
warmly
and
at
length
,
*NL*
and
though
inwardly
ashamed
at
exposing
his
most
intimate
feelings
to
*NL*
``
public
ignominy
,
''
so
to
speak
,
he
evidently
overcame
his
shame
in
order
*NL*
to
tell
the
truth
.
The
frigid
severity
,
with
which
the
investigating
*NL*
lawyer
,
and
still
more
the
prosecutor
,
stared
intently
at
him
as
he
told
*NL*
his
story
,
disconcerted
him
at
last
considerably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
boy
,
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
to
whom
I
was
talking
nonsense
about
*NL*
women
only
a
few
days
ago
,
and
that
sickly
prosecutor
are
not
worth
my
*NL*
telling
this
to
,
''
he
reflected
mournfully
.
``
It
's
ignominious
.
`
Be
patient
,
*NL*
humble
,
hold
thy
peace
.
'
''
He
wound
up
his
reflections
with
that
line
.
But
*NL*
he
pulled
himself
together
to
go
on
again
.
When
he
came
to
telling
of
his
*NL*
visit
to
Madame
Hohlakov
,
he
regained
his
spirits
and
even
wished
to
tell
*NL*
a
little
anecdote
of
that
lady
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
.
But
*NL*
the
investigating
lawyer
stopped
him
,
and
civilly
suggested
that
he
should
*NL*
pass
on
to
``
more
essential
matters
.
''
At
last
,
when
he
described
his
*NL*
despair
and
told
them
how
,
when
he
left
Madame
Hohlakov
's
,
he
thought
that
*NL*
he
'd
``
get
three
thousand
if
he
had
to
murder
some
one
to
do
it
,
''
they
*NL*
stopped
him
again
and
noted
down
that
he
had
``
meant
to
murder
some
one
.
''
*NL*
Mitya
let
them
write
it
without
protest
.
At
last
he
reached
the
point
in
*NL*
his
story
when
he
learned
that
Grushenka
had
deceived
him
and
had
returned
*NL*
from
Samsonov
's
as
soon
as
he
left
her
there
,
though
she
had
said
that
she
*NL*
would
stay
there
till
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
n't
kill
Fenya
then
,
gentlemen
,
it
was
only
because
I
had
n't
*NL*
time
,
''
broke
from
him
suddenly
at
that
point
in
his
story
.
That
,
too
,
was
*NL*
carefully
written
down
.
Mitya
waited
gloomily
,
and
was
beginning
to
tell
*NL*
how
he
ran
into
his
father
's
garden
when
the
investigating
lawyer
suddenly
*NL*
stopped
him
,
and
opening
the
big
portfolio
that
lay
on
the
sofa
beside
him
*NL*
he
brought
out
the
brass
pestle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
recognize
this
object
?
''
he
asked
,
showing
it
to
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
laughed
gloomily
.
``
Of
course
I
recognize
it
.
Let
me
have
a
*NL*
look
at
it
...
Damn
it
,
never
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
forgotten
to
mention
it
,
''
observed
the
investigating
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
it
all
,
I
should
n't
have
concealed
it
from
you
.
Do
you
suppose
I
*NL*
could
have
managed
without
it
?
It
simply
escaped
my
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
so
good
as
to
tell
us
precisely
how
you
came
to
arm
yourself
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
will
be
so
good
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mitya
described
how
he
took
the
pestle
and
ran
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
object
had
you
in
view
in
arming
yourself
with
such
a
weapon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
object
?
No
object
.
I
just
picked
it
up
and
ran
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
,
if
you
had
no
object
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
's
wrath
flared
up
.
He
looked
intently
at
``
the
boy
''
and
smiled
*NL*
gloomily
and
malignantly
.
He
was
feeling
more
and
more
ashamed
at
having
*NL*
told
``
such
people
''
the
story
of
his
jealousy
so
sincerely
and
*NL*
spontaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother
the
pestle
!
''
broke
from
him
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
to
keep
off
dogs

Oh
,
because
it
was
dark

In
case
anything
*NL*
turned
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
you
ever
on
previous
occasions
taken
a
weapon
with
you
when
you
*NL*
went
out

you
're
afraid
of
the
dark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
!
damn
it
all
,
gentlemen
!
There
's
positively
no
talking
to
you

''
cried
*NL*
Mitya
,
exasperated
beyond
endurance
,
and
turning
to
the
secretary
,
crimson
*NL*
with
anger
,
he
said
quickly
,
with
a
note
of
fury
in
his
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
down
at
once

at
once

I
snatched
up
the
pestle

go

kill
my
father

Fyodor
Pavlovitch

by
hitting
him
on
the
head
*NL*
with
it
!
'
Well
,
now
are
you
satisfied
,
gentlemen
?
Are
your
minds
*NL*
relieved

''
he
said
,
glaring
defiantly
at
the
lawyers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
quite
understand
that
you
made
that
statement
just
now
through
*NL*
exasperation
with
us
and
the
questions
we
put
to
you
,
which
you
consider
*NL*
trivial
,
though
they
are
,
in
fact

essential

the
prosecutor
remarked
*NL*
dryly
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
upon
my
word

gentlemen

Yes

pick
things
up
for
at
such
moments

I
do

what
for

I
snatched
it
*NL*
up
and
ran

that

all

For

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hand
.
He
sat
*NL*
sideways
to
them
and
gazed
at
the
wall
,
struggling
against
a
feeling
of
*NL*
nausea
.
He
had
,
in
fact
,
an
awful
inclination
to
get
up
and
declare
that
*NL*
he
would
n't
say
another
word
,
``
not

you
hang
me
for
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

he
said
at
last
,
with
difficulty
controlling
*NL*
himself
,
``
you
see

I
listen
to
you

am
haunted

It

a

have
sometimes

I
often
dream
it

somewhere
from
him

behind

in

degrading
way

and
the
worst
of
it
is

always

he
pretends

*NL*
``
Is
that
the
sort
of

you
dream
about

inquired
the
prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is

Do
n't
you
want
to
write
it
down

said
Mitya
,
with
a
*NL*
distorted
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
no
need
to

down

still
you
do
have
curious

``
It

not

with
extraordinary
softness

No

Mitya
flared
up
again
,
though
his
*NL*
outburst
of
wrath
had
obviously
relieved
his
heart

He
grew
more
good

*NL*
humored
at
every
word

believe
you

no

right
indeed

but

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Be
silent
,
heart
,
*NL*
Be
patient
,
humble
,
hold
thy
peace

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
shall
I
go
on
?
''
he
broke
off
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
be
so
kind

Chapter
V
.
The
Third
Ordeal
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mitya
spoke
sullenly
,
it
was
evident
that
he
was
trying
more
than
*NL*
ever
not
to
forget
or
miss
a
single
detail
of
his
story
.
He
told
them
how
*NL*
he
had
leapt
over
the
fence
into
his
father
's
garden
;
how
he
had
gone
up
*NL*
to
the
window
;
told
them
all
that
had
passed
under
the
window
.
Clearly
,
*NL*
precisely
,
distinctly
,
he
described
the
feelings
that
troubled
him
during
*NL*
those
moments
in
the
garden
when
he
longed
so
terribly
to
know
whether
*NL*
Grushenka
was
with
his
father
or
not
.
But
,
strange
to
say
,
both
the
*NL*
lawyers
listened
now
with
a
sort
of
awful
reserve
,
looked
coldly
at
him
,
*NL*
asked
few
questions
.
Mitya
could
gather
nothing
from
their
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
angry
and
offended
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Well
,
bother
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
described
how
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
make
the
``
signal
''
to
*NL*
his
father
that
Grushenka
had
come
,
so
that
he
should
open
the
window
,
the
*NL*
lawyers
paid
no
attention
to
the
word
``
signal
,
''
as
though
they
entirely
*NL*
failed
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
this
connection
:
so
much
so
,
*NL*
that
Mitya
noticed
it
.
Coming
at
last
to
the
moment
when
,
seeing
his
*NL*
father
peering
out
of
the
window
,
his
hatred
flared
up
and
he
pulled
the
*NL*
pestle
out
of
his
pocket
,
he
suddenly
,
as
though
of
design
,
stopped
short
.
*NL*
He
sat
gazing
at
the
wall
and
was
aware
that
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
the
investigating
lawyer
.
``
You
pulled
out
the
weapon
and
...
*NL*
and
what
happened
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
?
Why
,
then
I
murdered
him
...
hit
him
on
the
head
and
cracked
his
*NL*
skull
...
I
suppose
that
's
your
story
.
That
's
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
suddenly
flashed
.
All
his
smothered
wrath
suddenly
flamed
up
with
*NL*
extraordinary
violence
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
story
?
''
repeated
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
``
Well
--
and
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
dropped
his
eyes
and
was
a
long
time
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
story
,
gentlemen
?
Well
,
it
was
like
this
,
''
he
began
softly
.
``
Whether
*NL*
it
was
some
one
's
tears
,
or
my
mother
prayed
to
God
,
or
a
good
angel
*NL*
kissed
me
at
that
instant
,
I
do
n't
know
.
But
the
devil
was
conquered
.
I
*NL*
rushed
from
the
window
and
ran
to
the
fence
.
My
father
was
alarmed
and
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
,
he
saw
me
then
,
cried
out
,
and
sprang
back
from
the
*NL*
window
.
I
remember
that
very
well
.
I
ran
across
the
garden
to
the
fence
*NL*
...
and
there
Grigory
caught
me
,
when
I
was
sitting
on
the
fence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
point
he
raised
his
eyes
at
last
and
looked
at
his
listeners
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
be
staring
at
him
with
perfectly
unruffled
attention
.
A
sort
of
*NL*
paroxysm
of
indignation
seized
on
Mitya
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
laughing
at
me
at
this
moment
,
gentlemen
!
''
he
broke
off
*NL*
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
that
?
''
observed
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
believe
one
word
--
that
's
why
!
I
understand
,
of
course
,
that
I
*NL*
have
come
to
the
vital
point
.
The
old
man
's
lying
there
now
with
his
skull
*NL*
broken
,
while
I
--
after
dramatically
describing
how
I
wanted
to
kill
him
,
*NL*
and
how
I
snatched
up
the
pestle
--
I
suddenly
run
away
from
the
window
.
A
*NL*
romance
!
Poetry
!
As
though
one
could
believe
a
fellow
on
his
word
.
Ha
ha
!
*NL*
You
are
scoffers
,
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
swung
round
on
his
chair
so
that
it
creaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
notice
,
''
asked
the
prosecutor
suddenly
,
as
though
not
*NL*
observing
Mitya
's
excitement
,
``
did
you
notice
when
you
ran
away
from
the
*NL*
window
,
whether
the
door
into
the
garden
was
open
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
not
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
shut
.
And
who
could
open
it
?
Bah
!
the
door
.
Wait
a
bit
!
''
he
seemed
*NL*
suddenly
to
bethink
himself
,
and
almost
with
a
start
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
did
you
find
the
door
open
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
could
have
opened
it
if
you
did
not
open
it
yourselves
?
''
cried
*NL*
Mitya
,
greatly
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
door
stood
open
,
and
your
father
's
murderer
undoubtedly
went
in
at
*NL*
that
door
,
and
,
having
accomplished
the
crime
,
went
out
again
by
the
same
*NL*
door
,
''
the
prosecutor
pronounced
deliberately
,
as
though
chiseling
out
*NL*
each
word
separately
.
``
That
is
perfectly
clear
.
The
murder
was
committed
*NL*
in
the
room
and
_
not
through
the
__
window
_
;
that
is
absolutely
certain
*NL*
from
the
examination
that
has
been
made
,
from
the
position
of
the
body
and
*NL*
everything
.
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
circumstance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
absolutely
dumbfounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
utterly
impossible
!
''
he
cried
,
completely
at
a
loss
.
``
I
...
I
*NL*
did
n't
go
in
...
I
tell
you
positively
,
definitely
,
the
door
was
shut
the
*NL*
whole
time
I
was
in
the
garden
,
and
when
I
ran
out
of
the
garden
.
I
only
*NL*
stood
at
the
window
and
saw
him
through
the
window
.
That
's
all
,
that
's
*NL*
all
...
I
remember
to
the
last
minute
.
And
if
I
did
n't
remember
,
it
would
*NL*
be
just
the
same
.
I
know
it
,
for
no
one
knew
the
signals
except
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
and
me
,
and
the
dead
man
.
And
he
would
n't
have
opened
the
door
*NL*
to
any
one
in
the
world
without
the
signals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signals
?
What
signals
?
''
asked
the
prosecutor
,
with
greedy
,
almost
*NL*
hysterical
,
curiosity
.
He
instantly
lost
all
trace
of
his
reserve
and
*NL*
dignity
.
He
asked
the
question
with
a
sort
of
cringing
timidity
.
He
*NL*
scented
an
important
fact
of
which
he
had
known
nothing
,
and
was
already
*NL*
filled
with
dread
that
Mitya
might
be
unwilling
to
disclose
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
n't
know
!
''
Mitya
winked
at
him
with
a
malicious
and
mocking
*NL*
smile
.
``
What
if
I
wo
n't
tell
you
?
From
whom
could
you
find
out
?
No
one
*NL*
knew
about
the
signals
except
my
father
,
Smerdyakov
,
and
me
:
that
was
all
.
*NL*
Heaven
knew
,
too
,
but
it
wo
n't
tell
you
.
But
it
's
an
interesting
fact
.
*NL*
There
's
no
knowing
what
you
might
build
on
it
.
Ha
ha
!
Take
comfort
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
I
'll
reveal
it
.
You
've
some
foolish
idea
in
your
hearts
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
the
man
you
have
to
deal
with
!
You
have
to
do
with
a
prisoner
*NL*
who
gives
evidence
against
himself
,
to
his
own
damage
!
Yes
,
for
I
'm
a
man
*NL*
of
honor
and
you
--
are
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
swallowed
this
without
a
murmur
.
He
was
trembling
with
*NL*
impatience
to
hear
the
new
fact
.
Minutely
and
diffusely
Mitya
told
them
*NL*
everything
about
the
signals
invented
by
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
for
Smerdyakov
.
*NL*
He
told
them
exactly
what
every
tap
on
the
window
meant
,
tapped
the
*NL*
signals
on
the
table
,
and
when
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
said
that
he
supposed
*NL*
he
,
Mitya
,
had
tapped
the
signal
``
Grushenka
has
come
,
''
when
he
tapped
to
*NL*
his
father
,
he
answered
precisely
that
he
had
tapped
that
signal
,
that
*NL*
``
Grushenka
had
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
now
you
can
build
up
your
tower
,
''
Mitya
broke
off
,
and
again
turned
*NL*
away
from
them
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
no
one
knew
of
the
signals
but
your
dead
father
,
you
,
and
the
valet
*NL*
Smerdyakov
?
And
no
one
else
?
''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
inquired
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
The
valet
Smerdyakov
,
and
Heaven
.
Write
down
about
Heaven
.
That
may
*NL*
be
of
use
.
Besides
,
you
will
need
God
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
had
already
,
of
course
,
begun
writing
it
down
.
But
while
they
*NL*
wrote
,
the
prosecutor
said
suddenly
,
as
though
pitching
on
a
new
idea
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
Smerdyakov
also
knew
of
these
signals
and
you
absolutely
deny
all
*NL*
responsibility
for
the
death
of
your
father
,
was
it
not
he
,
perhaps
,
who
*NL*
knocked
the
signal
agreed
upon
,
induced
your
father
to
open
to
him
,
and
*NL*
then
...
committed
the
crime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
turned
upon
him
a
look
of
profound
irony
and
intense
hatred
.
His
*NL*
silent
stare
lasted
so
long
that
it
made
the
prosecutor
blink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
caught
the
fox
again
,
''
commented
Mitya
at
last
;
``
you
've
got
the
*NL*
beast
by
the
tail

Ha
ha
!
I
see
through
you
,
Mr.
Prosecutor
.
You
thought
,
*NL*
of
course
,
that
I
should
jump
at
that
,
catch
at
your
prompting
,
and
shout
*NL*
with
all
my
might
,
`
Aie
!
it
's
Smerdyakov
;
he
's
the
murderer
.
'
Confess
*NL*
that
's
what
you
thought
.
Confess
,
and
I
'll
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
prosecutor
did
not
confess
.
He
held
his
tongue
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
mistaken
.
I
'm
not
going
to
shout
`
It
's
Smerdyakov
,
'
''
said
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
even
suspect
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
you
suspect
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
suspected
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joking
apart
,
''
he
brought
out
gloomily
.
``
Listen
.
From
the
very
beginning
,
*NL*
almost
from
the
moment
when
I
ran
out
to
you
from
behind
the
curtain
,
I
've
*NL*
had
the
thought
of
Smerdyakov
in
my
mind
.
I
've
been
sitting
here
,
shouting
*NL*
that
I
'm
innocent
and
thinking
all
the
time
`
Smerdyakov
!
'
I
ca
n't
get
*NL*
Smerdyakov
out
of
my
head
.
In
fact
,
I
,
too
,
thought
of
Smerdyakov
just
*NL*
now
;
but
only
for
a
second
.
Almost
at
once
I
thought
,
`
No
,
it
's
not
*NL*
Smerdyakov
.
'
It
's
not
his
doing
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
is
there
anybody
else
you
suspect
?
''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
*NL*
inquired
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
any
one
it
could
be
,
whether
it
's
the
hand
of
Heaven
or
*NL*
Satan
,
but
...
not
Smerdyakov
,
''
Mitya
jerked
out
with
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
makes
you
affirm
so
confidently
and
emphatically
that
it
's
not
*NL*
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
my
conviction
--
my
impression
.
Because
Smerdyakov
is
a
man
of
the
most
*NL*
abject
character
and
a
coward
.
He
's
not
a
coward
,
he
's
the
epitome
of
all
*NL*
the
cowardice
in
the
world
walking
on
two
legs
.
He
has
the
heart
of
a
*NL*
chicken
.
When
he
talked
to
me
,
he
was
always
trembling
for
fear
I
should
*NL*
kill
him
,
though
I
never
raised
my
hand
against
him
.
He
fell
at
my
feet
*NL*
and
blubbered
;
he
has
kissed
these
very
boots
,
literally
,
beseeching
me
*NL*
`
not
to
frighten
him
.
'
Do
you
hear
?
`
Not
to
frighten
him
.
'
What
a
thing
to
*NL*
say
!
Why
,
I
offered
him
money
.
He
's
a
puling
chicken
--
sickly
,
epileptic
,
*NL*
weak-minded
--
a
child
of
eight
could
thrash
him
.
He
has
no
character
worth
*NL*
talking
about
.
It
's
not
Smerdyakov
,
gentlemen
.
He
does
n't
care
for
money
;
*NL*
he
would
n't
take
my
presents
.
Besides
,
what
motive
had
he
for
murdering
*NL*
the
old
man
?
Why
,
he
's
very
likely
his
son
,
you
know
--
his
natural
son
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
heard
that
legend

But
you
are
your
father
's
son
,
too

you
know

*NL*
yet
you
yourself
told
every
one
you
meant

murder
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

a
thrust

Oh

*NL*
gentlemen

is
n't
it
too
base
of
you
to
say
that
to
my
face

It
's
base

*NL*
because
I
told
you
that
myself

I
not
only
wanted
to
murder
him

but
I
*NL*
might
have
done
it

And
,
what
's
more

I
went
out

my
way
to
tell

murdered
him
.
But
,
you
see
,
I
did
n't
murder
*NL*
him
;
you
see
,
my
guardian
angel
saved
me
--
that
's
what
you
've
not
taken
into
*NL*
account
.
And
that
's
why
it
's
so
base
of
you
.
For
I
did
n't
kill
him
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
kill
him
!
Do
you
hear
,
I
did
not
kill
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
almost
choking
.
He
had
not
been
so
moved
before
during
the
whole
*NL*
interrogation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
has
he
told
you
,
gentlemen
--
Smerdyakov
,
I
mean
?
''
he
added
*NL*
suddenly
,
after
a
pause
.
``
May
I
ask
that
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
ask
any
question
,
''
the
prosecutor
replied
with
frigid
severity
,
*NL*
``
any
question
relating
to
the
facts
of
the
case
,
and
we
are
,
I
repeat
,
*NL*
bound
to
answer
every
inquiry
you
make
.
We
found
the
servant
Smerdyakov
,
*NL*
concerning
whom
you
inquire
,
lying
unconscious
in
his
bed
,
in
an
epileptic
*NL*
fit
of
extreme
severity
,
that
had
recurred
,
possibly
,
ten
times
.
The
*NL*
doctor
who
was
with
us
told
us
,
after
seeing
him
,
that
he
may
possibly
not
*NL*
outlive
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
that
's
so
,
the
devil
must
have
killed
him
,
''
broke
suddenly
from
*NL*
Mitya
,
as
though
until
that
moment
he
had
been
asking
himself
:
``
Was
it
*NL*
Smerdyakov
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
come
back
to
this
later
,
''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
decided
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
would
n't
you
like
to
continue
your
statement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
asked
for
a
rest
.
His
request
was
courteously
granted
.
After
*NL*
resting
,
he
went
on
with
his
story
.
But
he
was
evidently
depressed
.
He
was
*NL*
exhausted
,
mortified
and
morally
shaken
.
To
make
things
worse
the
*NL*
prosecutor
exasperated
him
,
as
though
intentionally
,
by
vexatious
*NL*
interruptions
about
``
trifling
points
.
''
Scarcely
had
Mitya
described
how
,
*NL*
sitting
on
the
wall
,
he
had
struck
Grigory
on
the
head
with
the
pestle
,
*NL*
while
the
old
man
had
hold
of
his
left
leg
,
and
how
he
had
then
jumped
*NL*
down
to
look
at
him
,
when
the
prosecutor
stopped
him
to
ask
him
to
*NL*
describe
exactly
how
he
was
sitting
on
the
wall
.
Mitya
was
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
was
sitting
like
this
,
astride
,
one
leg
on
one
side
of
the
wall
and
*NL*
one
on
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
pestle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pestle
was
in
my
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
your
pocket
?
Do
you
remember
that
precisely
?
Was
it
a
violent
blow
*NL*
you
gave
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
a
violent
one
.
But
why
do
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
sitting
on
the
chair
just
as
you
sat
on
the
wall
then
and
*NL*
showing
us
just
how
you
moved
your
arm
,
and
in
what
direction
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
making
fun
of
me
,
are
n't
you
?
''
asked
Mitya
,
looking
haughtily
at
*NL*
the
speaker
;
but
the
latter
did
not
flinch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
turned
abruptly
,
sat
astride
on
his
chair
,
and
swung
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
how
I
struck
him
!
That
's
how
I
knocked
him
down

What
more
do
*NL*
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
May
I
trouble
you
now
to
explain
why
you
jumped
down
,
with
*NL*
what
object

what
you
had
in
view
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

hang
it

I
jumped
down
to
look

what
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
you
were
so
excited

were
running

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
though
I
was
excited
and
running
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wanted
to
help

*NL*
*NL*
``
Help

Yes

perhaps
I
did
want
to
help
him

I
do
n't
remember

*NL*
``
You
do

quite
know

you
were
doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

I
remember
everything

every
detail

I
jumped
down
to
look
at
*NL*
him

and
wiped
his
face
with
my
handkerchief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
seen
your

Did

hope

consciousness

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Well

then
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

ran
away

*NL*
And
now
he
's
recovered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
,
''
commented
the
prosecutor
.
``
Thank
you
.
That
's
all
I
wanted
.
*NL*
Kindly
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
it
never
entered
Mitya
's
head
to
tell
them
,
though
he
remembered
it
,
*NL*
that
he
had
jumped
back
from
pity
,
and
standing
over
the
prostrate
figure
*NL*
had
even
uttered
some
words
of
regret
:
``
You
've
come
to
grief
,
old
*NL*
man
--
there
's
no
help
for
it
.
Well
,
there
you
must
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
could
only
draw
one
conclusion
:
that
the
man
had
jumped
*NL*
back
``
at
such
a
moment
and
in
such
excitement
simply
with
the
object
of
*NL*
ascertaining
whether
the
_
only
_
witness
of
his
crime
were
dead
;
that
he
*NL*
must
therefore
have
been
a
man
of
great
strength
,
coolness
,
decision
and
*NL*
foresight
even
at
such
a
moment
,
''
...
and
so
on
.
The
prosecutor
was
*NL*
satisfied
:
``
I
've
provoked
the
nervous
fellow
by
`
trifles
'
and
he
has
said
*NL*
more
than
he
meant
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
painful
effort
Mitya
went
on
.
But
this
time
he
was
pulled
up
*NL*
immediately
by
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
came
you
to
run
to
the
servant
,
Fedosya
Markovna
,
with
your
hands
so
*NL*
covered
with
blood
,
and
,
as
it
appears
,
your
face
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
did
n't
notice
the
blood
at
all
at
the
time
,
''
answered
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
quite
likely
.
It
does
happen
sometimes
.
''
The
prosecutor
exchanged
*NL*
glances
with
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
simply
did
n't
notice
.
You
're
quite
right
there
,
prosecutor
,
''
Mitya
*NL*
assented
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
came
the
account
of
Mitya
's
sudden
determination
to
``
step
aside
''
and
*NL*
make
way
for
their
happiness
.
But
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
open
*NL*
his
heart
to
them
as
before
,
and
tell
them
about
``
the
queen
of
his
soul
.
''
*NL*
He
disliked
speaking
of
her
before
these
chilly
persons
``
who
were
*NL*
fastening
on
him
like
bugs
.
''
And
so
in
response
to
their
reiterated
*NL*
questions
he
answered
briefly
and
abruptly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
kill
myself
.
What
had
I
left
to
live
for
?
That
*NL*
question
stared
me
in
the
face
.
Her
first
rightful
lover
had
come
back
,
*NL*
the
man
who
wronged
her
but
who
'd
hurried
back
to
offer
his
love
,
after
*NL*
five
years
,
and
atone
for
the
wrong
with
marriage
...
So
I
knew
it
was
all
*NL*
over
for
me
...
And
behind
me
disgrace
,
and
that
blood
--
Grigory
's
...
What
*NL*
had
I
to
live
for
?
So
I
went
to
redeem
the
pistols
I
had
pledged
,
to
load
*NL*
them
and
put
a
bullet
in
my
brain
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
grand
feast
the
night
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
grand
feast
the
night
before
.
Damn
it
all
,
gentlemen
!
Do
make
*NL*
haste
and
finish
it
.
I
meant
to
shoot
myself
not
far
from
here
,
beyond
the
*NL*
village
,
and
I
'd
planned
to
do
it
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
And
I
*NL*
had
a
note
in
my
pocket
already
.
I
wrote
it
at
Perhotin
's
when
I
loaded
my
*NL*
pistols
.
Here
's
the
letter
.
Read
it
!
It
's
not
for
you
I
tell
it
,
''
he
added
*NL*
contemptuously
.
He
took
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
flung
it
on
the
*NL*
table
.
The
lawyers
read
it
with
curiosity
,
and
,
as
is
usual
,
added
it
to
*NL*
the
papers
connected
with
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
n't
even
think
of
washing
your
hands
at
Perhotin
's
?
You
were
*NL*
not
afraid
then
of
arousing
suspicion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
suspicion
?
Suspicion
or
not
,
I
should
have
galloped
here
just
the
*NL*
same
,
and
shot
myself
at
five
o'clock
,
and
you
would
n't
have
been
in
time
*NL*
to
do
anything
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
what
's
happened
to
my
father
,
you
*NL*
would
have
known
nothing
about
it
,
and
would
n't
have
come
here
.
Oh
,
it
's
*NL*
the
devil
's
doing
.
It
was
the
devil
murdered
father
,
it
was
through
the
*NL*
devil
that
you
found
it
out
so
soon
.
How
did
you
manage
to
get
here
so
*NL*
quick
?
It
's
marvelous
,
a
dream
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Perhotin
informed
us
that
when
you
came
to
him
,
you
held
in
your
*NL*
hands

your
blood-stained
hands
...
your
money
...
a
lot
of
money
...
a
*NL*
bundle
of
hundred-rouble
notes
,
and
that
his
servant-boy
saw
it
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

I
remember

was
so

there
's
one
little
point
presents
itself

you
inform

*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
began
,
with
extreme
gentleness
,
``
where
did
you
get
so
*NL*
much
money
all
of
a
sudden

when
it
appears
from
the
facts

the
*NL*
reckoning
of
time
,
that
you
had
not
been
home
?

*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
's
brows
contracted
at
the
question
being
asked
so
plainly
,
*NL*
but
he
did
not
interrupt
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
did
n't
go
home

answered
Mitya
,
apparently
perfectly
composed
,
but
*NL*
looking
at
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
then
to
repeat
my
question

Nikolay
Parfenovitch
went
on
as
*NL*
though
creeping
up
to
the
subject
.
``
Where
were
you
able
to
procure
such
a

sum

five
o'clock
the

day

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
want
of
ten
roubles

pledged
my
pistols
with
Perhotin

*NL*
then
went
to
Madame
Hohlakov
to
borrow
three
thousand
which
she
would
n't
*NL*
give
me

so
on

all
the

Mitya
interrupted
sharply

*NL*
``
Yes

was
in

turned
up

both
afraid

That

just
how
it
is

I

not
going

tell
you

guessed
right

You
'll
never

''
said
Mitya
,
chipping
*NL*
out
each
word
with
extraordinary
determination
.
The
lawyers
were
silent
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
understand
,
Mr.
Karamazov

that
it

of
vital
importance

said
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
softly
and
suavely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

but
still
I
wo
n't
tell

*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
,
too
,
intervened
,
and
again
reminded
the
prisoner
that
he
*NL*
was
at
liberty
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
,
if
he
thought
it
to
his
*NL*
interest
,
and
so
on
.
But
in
view
of
the
damage
he
might
do
himself
by
his
*NL*
silence
,
especially
in
a
case
of
such
importance
as
--

*NL*
``
And
so
on

gentlemen

so
on

Enough
!
I
've
heard
that
rigmarole
*NL*
before

Mitya
interrupted
again
.
``
I
can
see
for
myself
how
important
it
*NL*
is

that
this
is
the
vital
point

still
I
wo
n't
say

*NL*
``
What
is
it
to

yourself
harm

observed
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
gentlemen
,
joking
apart

--
Mitya
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
firmly
*NL*
at
them
both
--
``
I
had
an
inkling
from
the
first
that
we
should
come
to
*NL*
loggerheads
at
this
point

But
at
first
when
I
began
to
give
my
evidence
,
*NL*
it
was
all
still
far
away
and
misty
;
it
was
all
floating
,
and
I
was
so
*NL*
simple
that
I
began
with
the
supposition
of
mutual
confidence
existing
*NL*
between
us
.
Now
I
can
see
for
myself
that
such
confidence
is
out
of
the
*NL*
question
,
for
in
any
case
we
were
bound
to
come
to
this
cursed
stumbling

*NL*
block

now
we
've
come
to
it

It
's
impossible

there
's
an
end

it

I
do
n't
blame
you

You

n't
believe
it
all

on
my
word

He
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence

the
nature

*NL*
Mitya
smiled
mournfully
,
almost
dreamily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
much
more
good-natured
than
you
think

I
'll
tell
you
the
*NL*
reason

and
give
you
that
hint
,
though
you
do
n't
deserve
it

I
wo
n't
*NL*
speak
of
that
,
gentlemen

because
it
would
be
a
stain
on
my
honor

The
*NL*
answer
to
the
question
where
I
got
the
money
would
expose
me
to
far
*NL*
greater
disgrace
than
the
murder
and
robbing
of
my
father
,
if
I
had
*NL*
murdered
and
robbed
him

That
's
why
I

n't

I
ca

are

going

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

Nikolay

*NL*
*NL*

You

down

I
only
told

I

I
made

pounce
upon
it
at
once

Oh

well

write

write
*NL*
what

he
concluded
,
with
scornful
disgust
.
``
I

still
hold
up
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ca

you
tell
us
the
nature

Nikolay
Parfenovitch
*NL*
hazarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
frowned
darkly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

_
c'est

n't
trouble
yourselves

It

not

soiling

I
have
soiled
myself
enough

*NL*
You

no

Enough

gentlemen

I
'm
not
going

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
too
peremptorily
.
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
did
not
insist
*NL*
further
,
but
from
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
's
eyes
he
saw
that
he
had
not
given
*NL*
up
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

how
many

exactly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
He
proceeded
to
do
so
,
but
we
wo
n't
repeat
his
story
.
He
told
it
dryly
and
*NL*
curtly
.
Of
the
raptures
of
his
love
he
said
nothing
,
but
told
them
that
he
*NL*
abandoned
his
determination
to
shoot
himself
,
owing
to
``
new
factors
in
the
*NL*
case
.
''
He
told
the
story
without
going
into
motives
or
details
.
And
this
*NL*
time
the
lawyers
did
not
worry
him
much
.
It
was
obvious
that
there
was
no
*NL*
essential
point
of
interest
to
them
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
verify
all
that

We
will
come
back
to
it
during

will
,
of
course
,
take
place
in
your
presence

''
*NL*
said
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
in
conclusion
.
``
And
now
allow
me
to
request
you
*NL*
to
lay
on
the
table
everything
in
your
possession

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Certainly

I

that
you
have

inquired
about

It

true
I

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
it
all
out
of
his
pockets
;
even
the
small
change
--
two
pieces
of
*NL*
twenty
copecks
--
he
pulled
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
They
counted
the
*NL*
money
,
which
amounted
to
eight
hundred
and
thirty-six
roubles
,
and
forty
*NL*
copecks

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
all

asked
the
investigating
lawyer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
reckoned
it
all
up

Mitya
helped
him
readily
.
They
*NL*
recollected
every
farthing
and
included
it
in
the
reckoning
.
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
hurriedly
added
up
the
total
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
eight
hundred
you
must
have
had
about
fifteen
hundred
at
*NL*
first

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so

snapped
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
they
all
assert

was
much
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

assert

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
asserted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

Well

''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
suddenly
got
up
,
and
informed
Mitya
firmly
that
it
*NL*
was
his
duty
and
obligation
to
conduct
a
minute
and
thorough
search

of

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
,
in
fact
,
begin
turning
out
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
necessary
to
take
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Ugh

Damn

*NL*
*NL*
``

You
must
take
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like

Mitya
submitted
gloomily
;
``
only
,
please
,
not
here

but
*NL*
behind
the
curtains

Who
will
search

*NL*
*NL*
``
Behind
the
curtains
,
of
course

''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
bent
his
head
in
assent

His
small
face
wore
an
*NL*
expression
of
peculiar
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
VI
.
The
Prosecutor
Catches
Mitya
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Something
utterly
unexpected
and
amazing
to
Mitya
followed
.
He
could
*NL*
never
,
even
a
minute
before
,
have
conceived
that
any
one
could
behave
like
*NL*
that
to
him
,
Mitya
Karamazov
.
What
was
worst
of
all
,
there
was
something
*NL*
humiliating
in
it
,
and
on
their
side
something
``
supercilious
and
*NL*
scornful
.
''
It
was
nothing
to
take
off
his
coat
,
but
he
was
asked
to
*NL*
undress
further
,
or
rather
not
asked
but
``
commanded
,
''
he
quite
understood
*NL*
that
.
From
pride
and
contempt
he
submitted
without
a
word
.
Several
*NL*
peasants
accompanied
the
lawyers
and
remained
on
the
same
side
of
the
*NL*
curtain
.
``
To
be
ready
if
force
is
required
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
``
and
perhaps
*NL*
for
some
other
reason
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
must
I
take
off
my
shirt
,
too
?
''
he
asked
sharply
,
but
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
did
not
answer
.
He
was
busily
engaged
with
the
prosecutor
in
*NL*
examining
the
coat
,
the
trousers
,
the
waistcoat
and
the
cap
;
and
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
they
were
both
much
interested
in
the
scrutiny
.
``
They
make
no
*NL*
bones
about
it
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
``
they
do
n't
keep
up
the
most
elementary
*NL*
politeness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
for
the
second
time
--
need
I
take
off
my
shirt
or
not
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
still
more
sharply
and
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
.
We
will
tell
you
what
to
do
,
''
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
said
,
and
his
voice
was
positively
peremptory
,
or
so
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
a
consultation
was
going
on
in
undertones
between
the
lawyers
.
*NL*
There
turned
out
to
be
on
the
coat
,
especially
on
the
left
side
at
the
*NL*
back
,
a
huge
patch
of
blood
,
dry
,
and
still
stiff
.
There
were
bloodstains
*NL*
on
the
trousers
,
too
.
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
moreover
,
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
peasant
witnesses
,
passed
his
fingers
along
the
collar
,
the
cuffs
,
and
*NL*
all
the
seams
of
the
coat
and
trousers
,
obviously
looking
for
*NL*
something
--
money
,
of
course
.
He
did
n't
even
hide
from
Mitya
his
suspicion
*NL*
that
he
was
capable
of
sewing
money
up
in
his
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
treats
me
not
as
an
officer
but
as
a
thief
,
''
Mitya
muttered
to
*NL*
himself
.
They
communicated
their
ideas
to
one
another
with
amazing
*NL*
frankness
.
The
secretary
,
for
instance
,
who
was
also
behind
the
curtain
,
*NL*
fussing
about
and
listening
,
called
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
's
attention
to
*NL*
the
cap
,
which
they
were
also
fingering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
Gridyenko
,
the
copying-clerk
,
''
observed
the
secretary
.
``
Last
*NL*
summer
he
received
the
wages
of
the
whole
office
,
and
pretended
to
have
*NL*
lost
the
money
when
he
was
drunk
.
And
where
was
it
found
?
Why
,
in
just
*NL*
such
pipings
in
his
cap
.
The
hundred-rouble
notes
were
screwed
up
in
*NL*
little
rolls
and
sewed
in
the
piping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
lawyers
remembered
Gridyenko
's
case
perfectly
,
and
so
laid
aside
*NL*
Mitya
's
cap
,
and
decided
that
all
his
clothes
must
be
more
thoroughly
*NL*
examined
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
cried
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
suddenly
,
noticing
that
the
right
*NL*
cuff
of
Mitya
's
shirt
was
turned
in
,
and
covered
with
blood
,
``
excuse
me
,
*NL*
what
's
that
,
blood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Mitya
jerked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
what
blood
?
...
and
why
is
the
cuff
turned
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
told
him
how
he
had
got
the
sleeve
stained
with
blood
looking
after
*NL*
Grigory
,
and
had
turned
it
inside
when
he
was
washing
his
hands
at
*NL*
Perhotin
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
off
your
shirt
,
too
.
That
's
very
important
as
material
*NL*
evidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
flushed
red
and
flew
into
a
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
am
I
to
stay
naked
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
.
We
will
arrange
something
.
And
meanwhile
take
off
*NL*
your
socks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
joking
?
Is
that
really
necessary
?
''
Mitya
's
eyes
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
in
no
mood
for
joking
,
''
answered
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
I
must
--
''
muttered
Mitya
,
and
sitting
down
on
the
bed
,
he
took
*NL*
off
his
socks
.
He
felt
unbearably
awkward
.
All
were
clothed
,
while
he
was
*NL*
naked
,
and
strange
to
say
,
when
he
was
undressed
he
felt
somehow
guilty
in
*NL*
their
presence
,
and
was
almost
ready
to
believe
himself
that
he
was
*NL*
inferior
to
them
,
and
that
now
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
despise
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
all
are
undressed
,
one
is
somehow
not
ashamed
,
but
when
one
's
the
*NL*
only
one
undressed
and
everybody
is
looking
,
it
's
degrading
,
''
he
kept
*NL*
repeating
to
himself
,
again
and
again
.
``
It
's
like
a
dream
,
I
've
sometimes
*NL*
dreamed
of
being
in
such
degrading
positions
.
''
It
was
a
misery
to
him
to
*NL*
take
off
his
socks
.
They
were
very
dirty
,
and
so
were
his
underclothes
,
*NL*
and
now
every
one
could
see
it
.
And
what
was
worse
,
he
disliked
his
feet
.
*NL*
All
his
life
he
had
thought
both
his
big
toes
hideous
.
He
particularly
*NL*
loathed
the
coarse
,
flat
,
crooked
nail
on
the
right
one
,
and
now
they
*NL*
would
all
see
it
.
Feeling
intolerably
ashamed
made
him
,
at
once
and
*NL*
intentionally
,
rougher
.
He
pulled
off
his
shirt
,
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
look
anywhere
else
if
you
're
not
ashamed
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
there
's
no
need
to
,
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
am
I
to
stay
naked
like
this
?
''
he
added
savagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
ca
n't
be
helped
for
the
time
...
Kindly
sit
down
here
for
a
*NL*
while

You
can
wrap
yourself
in
a
quilt
from
the
bed
,
and
I

I
'll
see
*NL*
to
all
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
things
were
shown
to
the
witnesses
.
The
report
of
the
search
was
*NL*
drawn
up
,
and
at
last
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
went
out
,
and
the
clothes
were
*NL*
carried
out
after
him
.
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
went
out
,
too
.
Mitya
was
left
*NL*
alone
with
the
peasants
,
who
stood
in
silence
,
never
taking
their
eyes
off
*NL*
him
.
Mitya
wrapped
himself
up
in
the
quilt
.
He
felt
cold
.
His
bare
feet
*NL*
stuck
out
,
and
he
could
n't
pull
the
quilt
over
so
as
to
cover
them
.
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
seemed
to
be
gone
a
long
time
,
``
an
insufferable
*NL*
time
.
''
``
He
thinks
of
me
as
a
puppy
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
gnashing
his
teeth
.
*NL*
``
That
rotten
prosecutor
has
gone
,
too
,
contemptuous
no
doubt
,
it
disgusts
*NL*
him
to
see
me
naked
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
imagined
,
however
,
that
his
clothes
would
be
examined
and
returned
*NL*
to
him
.
But
what
was
his
indignation
when
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
came
back
*NL*
with
quite
different
clothes
,
brought
in
behind
him
by
a
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
clothes
for
you
,
''
he
observed
airily
,
seeming
well
satisfied
*NL*
with
the
success
of
his
mission
.
``
Mr.
Kalganov
has
kindly
provided
these
*NL*
for
this
unusual
emergency
,
as
well
as
a
clean
shirt
.
Luckily
he
had
them
*NL*
all
in
his
trunk
.
You
can
keep
your
own
socks
and
underclothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
flew
into
a
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
have
other
people
's
clothes
!
''
he
shouted
menacingly
,
``
give
me
my
*NL*
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
my
own
.
Damn
Kalganov
and
his
clothes
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
persuade
him
.
But
they
succeeded
*NL*
somehow
in
quieting
him
down
.
They
impressed
upon
him
that
his
clothes
,
*NL*
being
stained
with
blood
,
must
be
``
included
with
the
other
material
*NL*
evidence
,
''
and
that
they
``
had
not
even
the
right
to
let
him
have
them
now
*NL*
...
taking
into
consideration
the
possible
outcome
of
the
case
.
''
Mitya
at
*NL*
last
understood
this
.
He
subsided
into
gloomy
silence
and
hurriedly
*NL*
dressed
himself
.
He
merely
observed
,
as
he
put
them
on
,
that
the
clothes
*NL*
were
much
better
than
his
old
ones
,
and
that
he
disliked
``
gaining
by
the
*NL*
change
.
''
The
coat
was
,
besides
,
``
ridiculously
tight
.
Am
I
to
be
dressed
up
*NL*
like
a
fool
...
for
your
amusement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
urged
upon
him
again
that
he
was
exaggerating
,
that
Kalganov
was
only
*NL*
a
little
taller
,
so
that
only
the
trousers
might
be
a
little
too
long
.
But
*NL*
the
coat
turned
out
to
be
really
tight
in
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
!
I
can
hardly
button
it
,
''
Mitya
grumbled
.
``
Be
so
good
as
to
*NL*
tell
Mr.
Kalganov
from
me
that
I
did
n't
ask
for
his
clothes
,
and
it
's
not
*NL*
my
doing
that
they
've
dressed
me
up
like
a
clown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
understands
that
,
and
is
sorry
...
I
mean
,
not
sorry
to
lend
you
his
*NL*
clothes
,
but
sorry
about
all
this
business
,
''
mumbled
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
his
sorrow
!
Well
,
where
now
?
Am
I
to
go
on
sitting
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
asked
to
go
back
to
the
``
other
room
.
''
Mitya
went
in
,
scowling
with
*NL*
anger
,
and
trying
to
avoid
looking
at
any
one
.
Dressed
in
another
man
's
*NL*
clothes
he
felt
himself
disgraced
,
even
in
the
eyes
of
the
peasants
,
and
*NL*
of
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
whose
face
appeared
,
for
some
reason
,
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
and
vanished
immediately
.
``
He
's
come
to
look
at
me
dressed
up
,
''
*NL*
thought
Mitya
.
He
sat
down
on
the
same
chair
as
before
.
He
had
an
absurd
*NL*
nightmarish
feeling
,
as
though
he
were
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
now
?
Are
you
going
to
flog
me
?
That
's
all
that
's
left
for
*NL*
you
,
''
he
said
,
clenching
his
teeth
and
addressing
the
prosecutor
.
He
would
*NL*
not
turn
to
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
as
though
he
disdained
to
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looked
too
closely
at
my
socks
,
and
turned
them
inside
out
on
purpose
*NL*
to
show
every
one
how
dirty
they
were
--
the
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
we
must
proceed
to
the
examination
of
witnesses
,
''
observed
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
as
though
in
reply
to
Mitya
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
prosecutor
thoughtfully
,
as
though
reflecting
on
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
done
what
we
could
in
your
interest
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
went
on
,
``
but
having
received
from
you
such
an
uncompromising
*NL*
refusal
to
explain
to
us
the
source
from
which
you
obtained
the
money
*NL*
found
upon
you
,
we
are
,
at
the
present
moment
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
stone
in
your
ring
?
''
Mitya
interrupted
suddenly
,
as
though
*NL*
awakening
from
a
reverie
.
He
pointed
to
one
of
the
three
large
rings
*NL*
adorning
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
's
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ring
?
''
repeated
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
one
...
on
your
middle
finger
,
with
the
little
veins
in
it
,
*NL*
what
stone
is
that
?
''
Mitya
persisted
,
like
a
peevish
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
smoky
topaz
,
''
said
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
smiling
.
``
Would
you
*NL*
like
to
look
at
it
?
I
'll
take
it
off
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
take
it
off
,
''
cried
Mitya
furiously
,
suddenly
waking
up
,
and
*NL*
angry
with
himself
.
``
Do
n't
take
it
off
...
there
's
no
need
...
Damn
it
!
...
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
you
've
sullied
my
heart
!
Can
you
suppose
that
I
would
conceal
*NL*
it
from
you
,
if
I
had
really
killed
my
father
,
that
I
would
shuffle
,
lie
,
*NL*
and
hide
myself
?
No
,
that
's
not
like
Dmitri
Karamazov
,
that
he
could
n't
*NL*
do
,
and
if
I
were
guilty
,
I
swear
I
should
n't
have
waited
for
your
coming
,
*NL*
or
for
the
sunrise
as
I
meant
at
first
,
but
should
have
killed
myself
*NL*
before
this
,
without
waiting
for
the
dawn
!
I
know
that
about
myself
now
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
have
learnt
so
much
in
twenty
years
as
I
've
found
out
in
this
*NL*
accursed
night
!
...
And
should
I
have
been
like
this
on
this
night
,
and
at
*NL*
this
moment
,
sitting
with
you
,
could
I
have
talked
like
this
,
could
I
have
*NL*
moved
like
this
,
could
I
have
looked
at
you
and
at
the
world
like
this
,
if
*NL*
I
had
really
been
the
murderer
of
my
father
,
when
the
very
thought
of
*NL*
having
accidentally
killed
Grigory
gave
me
no
peace
all
night
--
not
from
*NL*
fear
--
oh
,
not
simply
from
fear
of
your
punishment
!
The
disgrace
of
it
!
And
*NL*
you
expect
me
to
be
open
with
such
scoffers
as
you
,
who
see
nothing
and
*NL*
believe
in
nothing
,
blind
moles
and
scoffers
,
and
to
tell
you
another
*NL*
nasty
thing
I
've
done
,
another
disgrace
,
even
if
that
would
save
me
from
*NL*
your
accusation
!
No
,
better
Siberia
!
The
man
who
opened
the
door
to
my
*NL*
father
and
went
in
at
that
door
,
he
killed
him
,
he
robbed
him
.
Who
was
he
?
*NL*
I
'm
racking
my
brains
and
ca
n't
think
who
.
But
I
can
tell
you
it
was
not
*NL*
Dmitri
Karamazov
,
and
that
's
all
I
can
tell
you
,
and
that
's
enough
,
*NL*
enough
,
leave
me
alone
...
Exile
me
,
punish
me
,
but
do
n't
bother
me
any
*NL*
more
.
I
'll
say
no
more
.
Call
your
witnesses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
uttered
his
sudden
monologue
as
though
he
were
determined
to
be
*NL*
absolutely
silent
for
the
future
.
The
prosecutor
watched
him
the
whole
*NL*
time
and
only
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
,
observed
,
as
though
it
were
the
*NL*
most
ordinary
thing
,
with
the
most
frigid
and
composed
air
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
about
the
open
door
of
which
you
spoke
just
now
,
we
may
as
well
*NL*
inform
you
,
by
the
way
,
now
,
of
a
very
interesting
piece
of
evidence
of
*NL*
the
greatest
importance
both
to
you
and
to
us
,
that
has
been
given
us
by
*NL*
Grigory
,
the
old
man
you
wounded
.
On
his
recovery
,
he
clearly
and
*NL*
emphatically
stated
,
in
reply
to
our
questions
,
that
when
,
on
coming
out
*NL*
to
the
steps
,
and
hearing
a
noise
in
the
garden
,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
*NL*
into
it
through
the
little
gate
which
stood
open
,
before
he
noticed
you
*NL*
running
,
as
you
have
told
us
already
,
in
the
dark
from
the
open
window
*NL*
where
you
saw
your
father
,
he
,
Grigory
,
glanced
to
the
left
,
and
,
while
*NL*
noticing
the
open
window
,
observed
at
the
same
time
,
much
nearer
to
him
,
*NL*
the
door
,
standing
wide
open
--
that
door
which
you
have
stated
to
have
been
*NL*
shut
the
whole
time
you
were
in
the
garden
.
I
will
not
conceal
from
you
*NL*
that
Grigory
himself
confidently
affirms
and
bears
witness
that
you
must
*NL*
have
run
from
that
door
,
though
,
of
course
,
he
did
not
see
you
do
so
with
*NL*
his
own
eyes
,
since
he
only
noticed
you
first
some
distance
away
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
running
towards
the
fence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
had
leapt
up
from
his
chair
half-way
through
this
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
he
yelled
,
in
a
sudden
frenzy
,
``
it
's
a
barefaced
lie
.
He
*NL*
could
n't
have
seen
the
door
open
because
it
was
shut
.
He
's
lying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
it
my
duty
to
repeat
that
he
is
firm
in
his
statement
.
He
does
*NL*
not
waver
.
He
adheres
to
it
.
We
've
cross-examined
him
several
times

*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely

I
have
cross-examined
him
several
times

Nikolay
Parfenovitch
*NL*
confirmed
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

false

false

It
's
either
an
attempt
to
slander
me

the
*NL*
hallucination

a
madman

Mitya
still
shouted
.
``
He
's
simply
raving
,
from
*NL*
loss
of
blood

from
the
wound

came
to

's
raving

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
noticed

not
when

came
to
after
his

injuries

before
that
,
as
soon
as
he
went
into
the
garden
from
the
*NL*
lodge
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
false

spite

*NL*
gasped
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
turned
to
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
and
said
to
him
*NL*
impressively
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confront
him
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
recognize
this
object
?

*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
laid
upon
the
table
a
large
and
thick
official
*NL*
envelope
,
on
which
three
seals
still
remained
intact
.
The
envelope
was
*NL*
empty
,
and
slit
open
at
one
end
.
Mitya
stared
at
it
with
open
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
...
it
must
be
that
envelope
of
my
father

,
the
envelope
that
*NL*
contained
the
three
thousand
roubles

and
if
there
's
inscribed
on
it
,
*NL*
allow
me

For
my
little
chicken

yes

three
thousand

he
shouted
,
``
do
*NL*
you
see

three
thousand

do
you
see
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

we
see

But
we
did
n't
find
the
money
in
it

It
was
empty

*NL*
lying
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
,
behind
the
screen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
seconds
Mitya
stood
as
though
thunderstruck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
it
's
Smerdyakov
!
''
he
shouted
suddenly
,
at
the
top
of
his
*NL*
voice
.
``
It
's
he
who
's
murdered
him

He
's
robbed
him

No
one
else
knew

old
man
hid
the
envelope

It
's
Smerdyakov

that
's
clear
,
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
,
too

knew
of

that
it
was
under

pillow

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

at

Mitya
was
*NL*
completely
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

you
told

yourself

Nikolay

Nonsense

no

at
all

It
was
just
a
chance
guess
that
it
*NL*
was
under
the
pillow

What
does
Smerdyakov
say
?
Have
you
asked
him
where
*NL*
it
was
?
What
does
Smerdyakov
say
?
that
's
the
chief
point
...
And
I
went
*NL*
out
of
my
way
to
tell
lies
against
myself
...
I
told
you
without
thinking
*NL*
that
it
was
under
the
pillow
,
and
now
you
--
Oh
,
you
know
how
one
says
the
*NL*
wrong
thing
,
without
meaning
it
.
No
one
knew
but
Smerdyakov
,
only
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
and
no
one
else
...
He
did
n't
even
tell
me
where
it
was
!
But
*NL*
it
's
his
doing
,
his
doing
;
there
's
no
doubt
about
it

he
murdered
him
,
*NL*
that
's
as
clear
as
daylight
now

Mitya
exclaimed
more
and
more
*NL*
frantically
,
repeating
himself
incoherently
,
and
growing
more
and
more
*NL*
exasperated
and
excited
.
``
You
must
understand
that
,

arrest
him
at

once

He
must
have
killed
him
while
I
was
running
away

while
*NL*
Grigory
was
unconscious
,
that
's
clear
now

He
gave
the
signal
and
*NL*
father
opened
to
him

for
no

he
knew
the
signal

without

the
signal

would
never
have
opened

*NL*
*NL*
``

again
forgetting

the

observed
,
*NL*
still
speaking
with
the

restraint
,
though
with
a
note
of
triumph
,
*NL*
``

``

Mitya

he
stared
speechless
at

He
sank
back
helpless
in

All

staring
before

in
complete
stupefaction

the

on

*NL*
Mitya
was
indescribably
agitated

turned
pale

suddenly

But
the

gave

*NL*

Katerina

Nikolay

exclaimed
with
wonder

The

,
too

stared

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
n't
take
her

I

*NL*
Yes

I

that
evening

You
're
unworthy

No
need
of
that
at

I
need
only
tell
you
that
*NL*
she
sent
for
me
a
month
ago
,
gave
me
three
thousand
roubles
to
send
off
to
*NL*
her
sister
and
another
relation
in
Moscow
-LRB-
as
though
she
could
n't
have
*NL*
sent
it
off
herself

I
...
it
was
just
at

fatal
moment
in

life

I
...
well

in

when
I
'd
just
come
to
love
another

her

*NL*
she
's
sitting
down
below
now

Grushenka

I
carried
her
off
here
to
Mokroe
*NL*
then
,
and
wasted
here
in
two
days
half
that
damned
three
thousand
,
but
the
*NL*
other
half
I
kept
on
me
.
Well

I
've
kept
that
other
half

that
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
,
like
a
locket
round
my
neck

but
yesterday
I
undid
it

spent
*NL*
it

What
's
left
of
it

eight
hundred
roubles
,
is
in
your

now

yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse

that

What
was
your
reason
for
this
reticence

What
was
your
motive

making

such
a
secret
of
it
?
To
be
more
precise
:
You
have
told
us
at
last
your
*NL*
secret
,
in
your
words
,
so
`
disgraceful
,
'
though
in
reality
--
that
is

of
*NL*
course
,
comparatively
speaking
--
this
action

that
is
,
the
appropriation
of
*NL*
three
thousand
roubles
belonging
to
some
one
else
,
and
,
of
course
,
only
*NL*
for
a
time
is
,
in
my
view
at
least
,
only
an
act
of
the
greatest
*NL*
recklessness
and
not
so
disgraceful
,
when
one
takes
into
consideration
*NL*
your
character
...
Even
admitting
that
it
was
an
action
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
discreditable
,
still
,
discreditable
is
not
`
disgraceful

'
...
Many
*NL*
people
have
already
guessed
,
during
this
last
month
,
about
the
three
*NL*
thousand
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
,
that
you
have
spent
,
and
I
heard
the
*NL*
legend
myself
,
apart
from
your
confession
...
Mihail
Makarovitch
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
had
heard
it
,
too
,
so
that
indeed
,
it
was
scarcely
a
legend
,
but
*NL*
the
gossip
of
the
whole
town
.
There
are
indications
,
too
,
if
I
am
not
*NL*
mistaken
,
that
you
confessed
this
yourself
to
some
one
,
I
mean
that
the
*NL*
money
was
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
,
and
so
,
it
's
extremely
surprising
to
me
*NL*
that
hitherto
,
that
is
,
up
to
the
present
moment
,
you
have
made
such
an
*NL*
extraordinary
secret
of
the
fifteen
hundred
you
say
you
put
by
,
apparently
*NL*
connecting
a
feeling
of
positive
horror
with
that
secret
...
It
's
not
easy
*NL*
to
believe
that
it
could
cost
you
such
distress
to
confess
such
a
*NL*
secret
...
You
cried
out
,
just
now
,
that
Siberia
would
be
better
than
*NL*
confessing
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
ceased
speaking
.
He
was
provoked
.
He
did
not
conceal
his
*NL*
vexation
,
which
was
almost
anger
,
and
gave
vent
to
all
his
accumulated
*NL*
spleen
,
disconnectedly
and
incoherently
,
without
choosing
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
fifteen
hundred

's
the
disgrace

that
I
put
it
apart

the
rest
of
the
three
thousand

said
Mitya
firmly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

smiled
the
prosecutor
irritably

``

there
disgraceful

Your

more
important

by
the

way

why

half

gentlemen

purpose

I
put

aside

incomprehensible

see

attend
to
what
I
say

I
appropriate
three
*NL*
thousand
entrusted
to

honor

I
spend
it
on
a
spree

say
I
spend
it
all

*NL*
and
next
morning
I
go
to
her
and
say
,
`
Katya

I
've
done
wrong

I
've
*NL*
squandered
your
three
thousand

well

that
right

No

it
's
not

right

it
's
dishonest

cowardly

I
'm

with
no
more
self-control
*NL*
than
a
beast

that
's
so

it

But
still
I
'm
not

Not
a
*NL*
downright
thief

you
'll
admit

I
squandered
it

I
did
n't
steal
it
.
Now
*NL*
a
second

rather
more
favorable
alternative
:
follow
me
carefully
,
or
I
may
*NL*
get
confused
again
--
my
head
's
going
round
--
and
so
,
for
the
second
*NL*
alternative
:
I
spend
here
only
fifteen
hundred
out
of
the
three
thousand
,
*NL*
that
is
,
only
half
.
Next
day
I
go
and
take
that
half
to
her
:
`
Katya
,
take
*NL*
this
fifteen
hundred
from
me
,
I
'm
a
low
beast
,
and
an
untrustworthy
*NL*
scoundrel
,
for
I
've
wasted
half
the
money
,
and
I
shall
waste
this
,
too
,
so
*NL*
keep
me
from
temptation
!
'
Well
,
what
of
that
alternative
?
I
should
be
a
*NL*
beast
and
a
scoundrel
,
and
whatever
you
like
;
but
not
a
thief
,
not
*NL*
altogether
a
thief
,
or
I
should
not
have
brought
back
what
was
left
,
but
*NL*
have
kept
that
,
too
.
She
would
see
at
once
that
since
I
brought
back
half
,
*NL*
I
should
pay
back
what
I
'd
spent
,
that
I
should
never
give
up
trying
to
,
*NL*
that
I
should
work
to
get
it
and
pay
it
back
.
So
in
that
case
I
should
be
*NL*
a
scoundrel
,
but
not
a
thief
,
you
may
say
what
you
like
,
not
a
thief
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admit
that
there
is
a
certain
distinction
,
''
said
the
prosecutor
,
with
a
*NL*
cold
smile
.
``
But
it
's
strange
that
you
see
such
a
vital
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
see
a
vital
difference
!
Every
man
may
be
a
scoundrel
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
every
man
is
a
scoundrel
,
but
not
every
one
can
be
a
thief
,
it
takes
an
*NL*
arch-scoundrel
to
be
that
.
Oh
,
of
course
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
make
these
*NL*
fine
distinctions
...
but
a
thief
is
lower
than
a
scoundrel
,
that
's
my
*NL*
conviction
.
Listen
,
I
carry
the
money
about
me
a
whole
month
,
I
may
make
*NL*
up
my
mind
to
give
it
back
to-morrow
,
and
I
'm
a
scoundrel
no
longer
,
but
I
*NL*
can
not
make
up
my
mind
,
you
see
,
though
I
'm
making
up
my
mind
every
day
,
*NL*
and
every
day
spurring
myself
on
to
do
it
,
and
yet
for
a
whole
month
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bring
myself
to
it
,
you
see
.
Is
that
right
to
your
thinking
,
is
that
*NL*
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
that
's
not
right
,
that
I
can
quite
understand
,
and
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
dispute
,
''
answered
the
prosecutor
with
reserve
.
``
And
let
us
give
up
*NL*
all
discussion
of
these
subtleties
and
distinctions
,
and
,
if
you
will
be
*NL*
so
kind
,
get
back
to
the
point
.
And
the
point
is
,
that
you
have
still
not
*NL*
told
us
,
altogether
we
've
asked
you
,
why
,
in
the
first
place
,
you
halved
*NL*
the
money
,
squandering
one
half
and
hiding
the
other
?
For
what
purpose
*NL*
exactly
did
you
hide
it
,
what
did
you
mean
to
do
with
that
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
?
I
insist
upon
that
question

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
striking
himself
on
the
forehead
;
``
forgive
*NL*
me
,
I
'm
worrying
you
,
and
am
not
explaining
the
chief
point
,
or
you
'd
*NL*
understand
in
a
minute
,
for
it
's
just
the
motive
of
it
that
's
the
*NL*
disgrace
!
You
see
,
it
was
all
to
do
with
the
old
man
,
my
dead
father
.
He
*NL*
was
always
pestering
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
and
I
was
jealous
;
I
thought
*NL*
then
that
she
was
hesitating
between
me
and
him
.
So
I
kept
thinking
every
*NL*
day
,
suppose
she
were
to
make
up
her
mind
all
of
a
sudden
,
suppose
she
*NL*
were
to
leave
off
tormenting
me
,
and
were
suddenly
to
say
to
me
,
'
I
love
*NL*
you
,
not
him
;
take
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
.
'
And
I
'd
only
forty
*NL*
copecks
;
how
could
I
take
her
away
,
what
could
I
do
?
Why
,
I
'd
be
lost
.
You
*NL*
see
,
I
did
n't
know
her
then
,
I
did
n't
understand
her
,
I
thought
she
wanted
*NL*
money
,
and
that
she
would
n't
forgive
my
poverty
.
And
so
I
fiendishly
*NL*
counted
out
the
half
of
that
three
thousand
,
sewed
it
up
,
calculating
on
*NL*
it
,
sewed
it
up
before
I
was
drunk
,
and
after
I
had
sewn
it
up
,
I
went
off
*NL*
to
get
drunk
on
the
rest
.
Yes
,
that
was
base
.
Do
you
understand
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
lawyers
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
called
it
sensible
and
moral
on
your
part
not
to
have
*NL*
squandered
it
all
,
''
chuckled
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
``
for
after
all
what
*NL*
does
it
amount
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
I
stole
it
,
that
's
what
it
amounts
to
!
Oh
,
God
,
you
horrify
me
*NL*
by
not
understanding
!
Every
day
that
I
had
that
fifteen
hundred
sewn
up
*NL*
round
my
neck
,
every
day
and
every
hour
I
said
to
myself
,
`
You
're
a
thief
!
*NL*
you
're
a
thief
!
'
Yes
,
that
's
why
I
've
been
so
savage
all
this
month
,
*NL*
that
's
why
I
fought
in
the
tavern
,
that
's
why
I
attacked
my
father
,
it
was
*NL*
because
I
felt
I
was
a
thief
.
I
could
n't
make
up
my
mind
,
I
did
n't
dare
*NL*
even
to
tell
Alyosha
,
my
brother
,
about
that
fifteen
hundred
:
I
felt
I
was
*NL*
such
a
scoundrel
and
such
a
pickpocket
.
But
,
do
you
know
,
while
I
carried
*NL*
it
I
said
to
myself
at
the
same
time
every
hour
:
`
No
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
you
may
yet
not
be
a
thief
.
'
Why
?
Because
I
might
go
next
day
and
pay
back
*NL*
that
fifteen
hundred
to
Katya
.
And
only
yesterday
I
made
up
my
mind
to
*NL*
tear
my
amulet
off
my
neck
,
on
my
way
from
Fenya
's
to
Perhotin
.
I
had
n't
*NL*
been
able
till
that
moment
to
bring
myself
to
it
.
And
it
was
only
when
I
*NL*
tore
it
off
that
I
became
a
downright
thief
,
a
thief
and
a
dishonest
man
*NL*
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
Why
?
Because
,
with
that
I
destroyed
,
too
,
my
*NL*
dream
of
going
to
Katya
and
saying
,
`
I
'm
a
scoundrel
,
but
not
a
thief
!
'
Do
*NL*
you
understand
now
?
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
made
you
decide
to
do
it
yesterday
?
''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
*NL*
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
It
's
absurd
to
ask
.
Because
I
had
condemned
myself
to
die
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
this
morning
,
here
,
at
dawn
.
I
thought
it
made
no
difference
*NL*
whether
I
died
a
thief
or
a
man
of
honor
.
But
I
see
it
's
not
so
,
it
turns
*NL*
out
that
it
does
make
a
difference
.
Believe
me
,
gentlemen
,
what
has
*NL*
tortured
me
most
during
this
night
has
not
been
the
thought
that
I
'd
*NL*
killed
the
old
servant
,
and
that
I
was
in
danger
of
Siberia
just
when
my
*NL*
love
was
being
rewarded
,
and
Heaven
was
open
to
me
again
.
Oh
,
that
did
*NL*
torture
me
,
but
not
in
the
same
way
:
not
so
much
as
the
damned
*NL*
consciousness
that
I
had
torn
that
damned
money
off
my
breast
at
last
and
*NL*
spent
it
,
and
had
become
a
downright
thief
!
Oh
,
gentlemen
,
I
tell
you
*NL*
again
,
with
a
bleeding
heart
,
I
have
learnt
a
great
deal
this
night
.
I
*NL*
have
learnt
that
it
's
not
only
impossible
to
live
a
scoundrel
,
but
*NL*
impossible
to
die
a
scoundrel
...
No
,
gentlemen
,
one
must
die
honest
...

*NL*
Mitya
was
pale
.
His
face
had
a
haggard
and
exhausted
look

in

of
his
*NL*
being
intensely
excited

said
slowly

in

soft
and
almost
compassionate
tone
.
``
But
all
this

you
'll
excuse
my

a
matter
of
nerves

my
opinion

your
*NL*
overwrought
nerves

that
's
what
it
is

And
why

for

should
you

not
have
saved
yourself
such
misery

almost
a

going

returning

fifteen

in

position

you
describe
as
being
so
awful

suddenly
crimsoned

with
indignation

looking

straight
in

seeming
unable

He
bent
his

hid
his

in
his

The
lawyers
were
silent

*NL*
A
minute
later
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
them
almost
vacantly
.
His
*NL*
face
now
expressed
complete
,
hopeless
despair
,
and
he
sat
mute
and
passive
*NL*
as
though
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
happening

In
the
meantime
they
had
*NL*
to
finish
what
they
were
about
.
They
had
immediately
to
begin
examining
*NL*
the
witnesses
.
It
was
by
now
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
lights
had
*NL*
been
extinguished
long
ago

Mihail
Makarovitch
and
Kalganov
,
who
had
been
*NL*
continually
in
and
out
of
the
room
all
the
while
the
interrogation
had
*NL*
been
going
on
,
had
now
both
gone
out
again
.
The
lawyers
,
too
,
looked
very
*NL*
tired
.
It
was
a
wretched
morning
,
the
whole
sky
was
overcast
,
and
the
rain
*NL*
streamed
down
in
bucketfuls
.
Mitya
gazed
blankly
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
look
out
of
the
window

he
asked
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
much
as
you
like

the
latter
replied

*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
...
The
rain
lashed
against
its
little
*NL*
greenish
panes
.
He
could
see
the
muddy
road
just
below
the
house
,
and
*NL*
farther
away
,
in
the
rain
and
mist
,
a
row
of
poor
,
black
,
dismal
huts
,
*NL*
looking
even
blacker
and
poorer
in
the
rain
.
Mitya
thought
of
``
Phoebus
the
*NL*
golden-haired
,
''
and
how
he
had
meant
to
shoot
himself
at
his
first
ray
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
would
be
even
better
on
a
morning
like
this

he
thought
with
*NL*
a
smile
,
and
suddenly
,
flinging
his
hand
downwards
,
he
turned
to
his
*NL*
``
torturers

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

he
cried
,
``

see

answered
at
once

with
evident
alacrity

taken

off

to
do
now

'm
ready

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

ought
to
make
haste

be
done
in
your

therefore

*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
n't

have
some
tea
first

interposed
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
``
I
*NL*
think
we
've
deserved
it

*NL*
*NL*
They
decided
that
if
tea
were
ready
downstairs
-LRB-
Mihail
Makarovitch
had
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
gone
down
to
get
some
-RRB-
they
would
have
a
glass
and
then
``
go
on
and
*NL*
on
,
''
putting
off
their
proper
breakfast
until
a
more
favorable
*NL*
opportunity
.
Tea
really
was
ready
below
,
and
was
soon
brought
up
.
Mitya
at
*NL*
first
refused
the
glass
that
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
politely
offered
him
,
*NL*
but
afterwards
he
asked
for
it
himself
and
drank
it
greedily
.
He
looked
*NL*
surprisingly
exhausted
.
It
might
have
been
supposed
from
his
Herculean
*NL*
strength
that
one
night
of
carousing
,
even
accompanied
by
the
most
violent
*NL*
emotions
,
could
have
had
little
effect
on
him
.
But
he
felt
that
he
could
*NL*
hardly
hold
his
head
up
,
and
from
time
to
time
all
the
objects
about
him
*NL*
seemed
heaving
and
dancing
before
his
eyes
.
``
A
little
more
and
I
shall

begin
raving

said

Chapter

The
Evidence
Of
The
Witnesses
.
The
Babe
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
examination
of
the
witnesses
began
.
But
we
will
not
continue
our
story
*NL*
in
such
detail
as
before
.
And
so
we
will
not
dwell
on
how
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
impressed
on
every
witness
called
that
he
must
give
his
*NL*
evidence
in
accordance
with
truth
and
conscience
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
afterwards
have
to
repeat
his
evidence
on
oath
,
how
every
witness
was
*NL*
called
upon
to
sign
the
protocol
of
his
evidence
,
and
so
on
.
We
will
only
*NL*
note
that
the
point
principally
insisted
upon
in
the
examination
was
the
*NL*
question
of
the
three
thousand
roubles
,
that
is
,
was
the
sum
spent
here
,
*NL*
at
Mokroe
,
by
Mitya
on
the
first
occasion
,
a
month
before
,
three
thousand
*NL*
or
fifteen
hundred
?
And
again
had
he
spent
three
thousand
or
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
yesterday
?
Alas
,
all
the
evidence
given
by
every
one
turned
out
to
*NL*
be
against
Mitya
.
There
was
not
one
in
his
favor
,
and
some
witnesses
*NL*
introduced
new
,
almost
crushing
facts
,
in
contradiction
of
his
,
Mitya
's
,
*NL*
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
witness
examined
was
Trifon
Borissovitch
.
He
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
abashed
as
he
stood
before
the
lawyers
.
He
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
*NL*
air
of
stern
and
severe
indignation
with
the
accused
,
which
gave
him
an
*NL*
appearance
of
truthfulness
and
personal
dignity
.
He
spoke
little
,
and
with
*NL*
reserve
,
waited
to
be
questioned
,
answered
precisely
and
deliberately
.
*NL*
Firmly
and
unhesitatingly
he
bore
witness
that
the
sum
spent
a
month
*NL*
before
could
not
have
been
less
than
three
thousand
,
that
all
the
peasants
*NL*
about
here
would
testify
that
they
had
heard
the
sum
of
three
thousand
*NL*
mentioned
by
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
himself
.
``
What
a
lot
of
money
he
flung
*NL*
away
on
the
gypsy
girls
alone
!
He
wasted
a
thousand
,
I
daresay
,
on
them
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
gave
them
five
hundred
,
''
was
Mitya
's
gloomy
comment
on
*NL*
this
.
``
It
's
a
pity
I
did
n't
count
the
money
at
the
time
,
but
I
was
*NL*
drunk
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
sitting
sideways
with
his
back
to
the
curtains
.
He
listened
*NL*
gloomily
,
with
a
melancholy
and
exhausted
air
,
as
though
he
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
say
what
you
like
.
It
makes
no
difference
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
a
thousand
went
on
them
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
''
retorted
Trifon
*NL*
Borissovitch
firmly
.
``
You
flung
it
about
at
random
and
they
picked
it
up
.
*NL*
They
were
a
rascally
,
thievish
lot
,
horse-stealers
,
they
've
been
driven
*NL*
away
from
here
,
or
maybe
they
'd
bear
witness
themselves
how
much
they
got
*NL*
from
you
.
I
saw
the
sum
in
your
hands
,
myself
--
count
it
I
did
n't
,
you
*NL*
did
n't
let
me
,
that
's
true
enough
--
but
by
the
look
of
it
I
should
say
it
*NL*
was
far
more
than
fifteen
hundred
...
fifteen
hundred
,
indeed
!
We
've
seen
*NL*
money
too
.
We
can
judge
of
amounts
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
sum
spent
yesterday
he
asserted
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
had
*NL*
told
him
,
as
soon
as
he
arrived
,
that
he
had
brought
three
thousand
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
is
that
so
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
?
''
replied
Mitya
.
``
Surely
I
*NL*
did
n't
declare
so
positively
that
I
'd
brought
three
thousand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
say
so
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
You
said
it
before
Andrey
.
Andrey
*NL*
himself
is
still
here
.
Send
for
him
.
And
in
the
hall
,
when
you
were
*NL*
treating
the
chorus
,
you
shouted
straight
out
that
you
would
leave
your
*NL*
sixth
thousand
here
--
that
is
with
what
you
spent
before
,
we
must
*NL*
understand
.
Stepan
and
Semyon
heard
it
,
and
Pyotr
Fomitch
Kalganov
,
too
,
*NL*
was
standing
beside
you
at
the
time
.
Maybe
he
'd
remember
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evidence
as
to
the
``
sixth
''
thousand
made
an
extraordinary
impression
*NL*
on
the
two
lawyers
.
They
were
delighted
with
this
new
mode
of
reckoning
;
*NL*
three
and
three
made
six
,
three
thousand
then
and
three
now
made
six
,
that
*NL*
was
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
questioned
all
the
peasants
suggested
by
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
Stepan
*NL*
and
Semyon
,
the
driver
Andrey
,
and
Kalganov
.
The
peasants
and
the
driver
*NL*
unhesitatingly
confirmed
Trifon
Borissovitch
's
evidence
.
They
noted
down
,
*NL*
with
particular
care
,
Andrey
's
account
of
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
*NL*
Mitya
on
the
road
:
''
`
Where
,
'
says
he
,
`
am
I
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
going
,
*NL*
to
heaven
or
to
hell
,
and
shall
I
be
forgiven
in
the
next
world
or
not
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
psychological
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
heard
this
with
a
subtle
smile
,
and
*NL*
ended
by
recommending
that
these
remarks
as
to
where
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
*NL*
would
go
should
be
``
included
in
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kalganov
,
when
called
,
came
in
reluctantly
,
frowning
and
ill-humored
,
and
*NL*
he
spoke
to
the
lawyers
as
though
he
had
never
met
them
before
in
his
*NL*
life
,
though
they
were
acquaintances
whom
he
had
been
meeting
every
day
*NL*
for
a
long
time
past
.
He
began
by
saying
that
``
he
knew
nothing
about
it
*NL*
and
did
n't
want
to
.
''
But
it
appeared
that
he
had
heard
of
the
``
sixth
''
*NL*
thousand
,
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
standing
close
by
at
the
*NL*
moment
.
As
far
as
he
could
see
he
``
did
n't
know
''
how
much
money
Mitya
had
*NL*
in
his
hands
.
He
affirmed
that
the
Poles
had
cheated
at
cards
.
In
reply
to
*NL*
reiterated
questions
he
stated
that
,
after
the
Poles
had
been
turned
out
,
*NL*
Mitya
's
position
with
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
had
certainly
improved
,
and
*NL*
that
she
had
said
that
she
loved
him
.
He
spoke
of
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
*NL*
with
reserve
and
respect
,
as
though
she
had
been
a
lady
of
the
best
*NL*
society
,
and
did
not
once
allow
himself
to
call
her
Grushenka
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
the
young
man
's
obvious
repugnance
at
giving
evidence
,
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
examined
him
at
great
length
,
and
only
from
him
learnt
all
*NL*
the
details
of
what
made
up
Mitya
's
``
romance
,
''
so
to
say
,
on
that
night
.
*NL*
Mitya
did
not
once
pull
Kalganov
up
.
At
last
they
let
the
young
man
go
,
*NL*
and
he
left
the
room
with
unconcealed
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Poles
,
too
,
were
examined
.
Though
they
had
gone
to
bed
in
their
room
,
*NL*
they
had
not
slept
all
night
,
and
on
the
arrival
of
the
police
officers
*NL*
they
hastily
dressed
and
got
ready
,
realizing
that
they
would
certainly
be
*NL*
sent
for
.
They
gave
their
evidence
with
dignity
,
though
not
without
some
*NL*
uneasiness
.
The
little
Pole
turned
out
to
be
a
retired
official
of
the
*NL*
twelfth
class
,
who
had
served
in
Siberia
as
a
veterinary
surgeon
.
His
name
*NL*
was
Mussyalovitch
.
Pan
Vrublevsky
turned
out
to
be
an
uncertificated
*NL*
dentist
.
Although
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
asked
them
questions
on
entering
*NL*
the
room
they
both
addressed
their
answers
to
Mihail
Makarovitch
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
on
one
side
,
taking
him
in
their
ignorance
for
the
most
important
*NL*
person
and
in
command
,
and
addressed
him
at
every
word
as
``
Pan
Colonel
.
''
*NL*
Only
after
several
reproofs
from
Mihail
Makarovitch
himself
,
they
grasped
*NL*
that
they
had
to
address
their
answers
to
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
only
.
It
*NL*
turned
out
that
they
could
speak
Russian
quite
correctly
except
for
their
*NL*
accent
in
some
words
.
Of
his
relations
with
Grushenka
,
past
and
present
,
*NL*
Pan
Mussyalovitch
spoke
proudly
and
warmly
,
so
that
Mitya
was
roused
at
*NL*
once
and
declared
that
he
would
not
allow
the
``
scoundrel
''
to
speak
like
*NL*
that
in
his
presence
!
Pan
Mussyalovitch
at
once
called
attention
to
the
*NL*
word
``
scoundrel
''
and
begged
that
it
should
be
put
down
in
the
protocol
.
*NL*
Mitya
fumed
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
scoundrel
!
A
scoundrel
!
You
can
put
that
down
.
And
put
down
,
too
,
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
the
protocol
I
still
declare
that
he
's
a
scoundrel
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
did
insert
this
in
the
protocol
,
he
showed
the
*NL*
most
praiseworthy
tact
and
management
.
After
sternly
reprimanding
Mitya
,
*NL*
he
cut
short
all
further
inquiry
into
the
romantic
aspect
of
the
case
,
and
*NL*
hastened
to
pass
to
what
was
essential
.
One
piece
of
evidence
given
by
the
*NL*
Poles
roused
special
interest
in
the
lawyers
:
that
was
how
,
in
that
very
*NL*
room
,
Mitya
had
tried
to
buy
off
Pan
Mussyalovitch
,
and
had
offered
him
*NL*
three
thousand
roubles
to
resign
his
claims
,
seven
hundred
roubles
down
,
*NL*
and
the
remaining
two
thousand
three
hundred
``
to
be
paid
next
day
in
the
*NL*
town
.
''
He
had
sworn
at
the
time
that
he
had
not
the
whole
sum
with
him
at
*NL*
Mokroe
,
but
that
his
money
was
in
the
town
.
Mitya
observed
hotly
that
he
*NL*
had
not
said
that
he
would
be
sure
to
pay
him
the
remainder
next
day
in
*NL*
the
town
.
But
Pan
Vrublevsky
confirmed
the
statement
,
and
Mitya
,
after
*NL*
thinking
for
a
moment
admitted
,
frowning
,
that
it
must
have
been
as
the
*NL*
Poles
stated
,
that
he
had
been
excited
at
the
time
,
and
might
indeed
have
*NL*
said
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
positively
pounced
on
this
piece
of
evidence
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
establish
for
the
prosecution
-LRB-
and
they
did
,
in
fact
,
base
this
deduction
*NL*
on
it
-RRB-
that
half
,
or
a
part
of
,
the
three
thousand
that
had
come
into
*NL*
Mitya
's
hands
might
really
have
been
left
somewhere
hidden
in
the
town
,
or
*NL*
even
,
perhaps
,
somewhere
here
,
in
Mokroe
.
This
would
explain
the
*NL*
circumstance
,
so
baffling
for
the
prosecution
,
that
only
eight
hundred
*NL*
roubles
were
to
be
found
in
Mitya
's
hands
.
This
circumstance
had
been
the
*NL*
one
piece
of
evidence
which
,
insignificant
as
it
was
,
had
hitherto
told
,
*NL*
to
some
extent
,
in
Mitya
's
favor
.
Now
this
one
piece
of
evidence
in
his
*NL*
favor
had
broken
down
.
In
answer
to
the
prosecutor
's
inquiry
,
where
he
*NL*
would
have
got
the
remaining
two
thousand
three
hundred
roubles
,
since
he
*NL*
himself
had
denied
having
more
than
fifteen
hundred
,
Mitya
confidently
*NL*
replied
that
he
had
meant
to
offer
the
``
little
chap
,
''
not
money
,
but
a
*NL*
formal
deed
of
conveyance
of
his
rights
to
the
village
of
Tchermashnya
,
*NL*
those
rights
which
he
had
already
offered
to
Samsonov
and
Madame
Hohlakov
.
*NL*
The
prosecutor
positively
smiled
at
the
``
innocence
of
this
subterfuge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
imagine
he
would
have
accepted
such
a
deed
as
a
substitute
for
*NL*
two
thousand
three
hundred
roubles
in
cash
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
certainly
would
have
accepted
it
,
''
Mitya
declared
warmly
.
``
Why
,
look
*NL*
here
,
he
might
have
grabbed
not
two
thousand
,
but
four
or
six
,
for
it
.
He
*NL*
would
have
put
his
lawyers
,
Poles
and
Jews
,
on
to
the
job
,
and
might
have
*NL*
got
,
not
three
thousand
,
but
the
whole
property
out
of
the
old
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evidence
of
Pan
Mussyalovitch
was
,
of
course
,
entered
in
the
protocol
*NL*
in
the
fullest
detail
.
Then
they
let
the
Poles
go
.
The
incident
of
the
*NL*
cheating
at
cards
was
hardly
touched
upon
.
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
was
too
*NL*
well
pleased
with
them
,
as
it
was
,
and
did
not
want
to
worry
them
with
*NL*
trifles
,
moreover
,
it
was
nothing
but
a
foolish
,
drunken
quarrel
over
*NL*
cards
.
There
had
been
drinking
and
disorder
enough
,
that
night
...
So
the
*NL*
two
hundred
roubles
remained
in
the
pockets
of
the
Poles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
old
Maximov
was
summoned
.
He
came
in
timidly
,
approached
with
little
*NL*
steps
,
looking
very
disheveled
and
depressed
.
He
had
,
all
this
time
,
taken
*NL*
refuge
below
with
Grushenka
,
sitting
dumbly
beside
her
,
and
``
now
and
then
*NL*
he
'd
begin
blubbering
over
her
and
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
blue
check
*NL*
handkerchief
,
''
as
Mihail
Makarovitch
described
afterwards
.
So
that
she
*NL*
herself
began
trying
to
pacify
and
comfort
him
.
The
old
man
at
once
*NL*
confessed
that
he
had
done
wrong
,
that
he
had
borrowed
``
ten
roubles
in
my
*NL*
poverty
,
''
from
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
and
that
he
was
ready
to
pay
it
back
.
*NL*
To
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
's
direct
question
,
had
he
noticed
how
much
money
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
held
in
his
hand
,
as
he
must
have
been
able
to
see
the
*NL*
sum
better
than
any
one
when
he
took
the
note
from
him
,
Maximov
,
in
the
*NL*
most
positive
manner
,
declared
that
there
was
twenty
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
so
much
as
twenty
thousand
before
,
then
?
''
inquired
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
I
have
,
not
twenty
,
but
seven
,
when
my
wife
mortgaged
my
*NL*
little
property
.
She
'd
only
let
me
look
at
it
from
a
distance
,
boasting
of
*NL*
it
to
me
.
It
was
a
very
thick
bundle
,
all
rainbow-colored
notes
.
And
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
's
were
all
rainbow-colored
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
kept
long
.
At
last
it
was
Grushenka
's
turn
.
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
was
obviously
apprehensive
of
the
effect
her
appearance
might
*NL*
have
on
Mitya
,
and
he
muttered
a
few
words
of
admonition
to
him
,
but
Mitya
*NL*
bowed
his
head
in
silence
,
giving
him
to
understand
``
that
he
would
not
*NL*
make
a
scene
.
''
Mihail
Makarovitch
himself
led
Grushenka
in
.
She
entered
*NL*
with
a
stern
and
gloomy
face
,
that
looked
almost
composed
and
sat
down
*NL*
quietly
on
the
chair
offered
her
by
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
She
was
very
*NL*
pale
,
she
seemed
to
be
cold
,
and
wrapped
herself
closely
in
her
*NL*
magnificent
black
shawl
.
She
was
suffering
from
a
slight
feverish
*NL*
chill
--
the
first
symptom
of
the
long
illness
which
followed
that
night
.
Her
*NL*
grave
air
,
her
direct
earnest
look
and
quiet
manner
made
a
very
favorable
*NL*
impression
on
every
one
.
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
was
even
a
little
bit
*NL*
``
fascinated
.
''
He
admitted
himself
,
when
talking
about
it
afterwards
,
that
*NL*
only
then
had
he
seen
``
how
handsome
the
woman
was
,
''
for
,
though
he
had
*NL*
seen
her
several
times
before
,
he
had
always
looked
upon
her
as
something
*NL*
of
a
``
provincial
hetaira
.
''
``
She
has
the
manners
of
the
best
society
,
''
he
*NL*
said
enthusiastically
,
gossiping
about
her
in
a
circle
of
ladies
.
But
this
*NL*
was
received
with
positive
indignation
by
the
ladies
,
who
immediately
*NL*
called
him
a
``
naughty
man
,
''
to
his
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
entered
the
room
,
Grushenka
only
glanced
for
an
instant
at
Mitya
,
*NL*
who
looked
at
her
uneasily
.
But
her
face
reassured
him
at
once
.
After
the
*NL*
first
inevitable
inquiries
and
warnings
,
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
asked
her
,
*NL*
hesitating
a
little
,
but
preserving
the
most
courteous
manner
,
on
what
*NL*
terms
she
was
with
the
retired
lieutenant
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
.
*NL*
To
this
Grushenka
firmly
and
quietly
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
an
acquaintance
.
He
came
to
see
me
as
an
acquaintance
during
the
*NL*
last
month
.
''
To
further
inquisitive
questions
she
answered
plainly
and
*NL*
with
complete
frankness
,
that
,
though
``
at
times
''
she
had
thought
him
*NL*
attractive
,
she
had
not
loved
him
,
but
had
won
his
heart
as
well
as
his
*NL*
old
father
's
``
in
my
nasty
spite
,
''
that
she
had
seen
that
Mitya
was
very
*NL*
jealous
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
every
one
else
;
but
that
had
only
amused
*NL*
her
.
She
had
never
meant
to
go
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
she
had
simply
been
*NL*
laughing
at
him
.
``
I
had
no
thoughts
for
either
of
them
all
this
last
*NL*
month
.
I
was
expecting
another
man
who
had
wronged
me
.
But
I
think
,
''
she
*NL*
said
in
conclusion
,
``
that
there
's
no
need
for
you
to
inquire
about
that
,
*NL*
nor
for
me
to
answer
you
,
for
that
's
my
own
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
immediately
acted
upon
this
hint
.
He
again
dismissed
*NL*
the
``
romantic
''
aspect
of
the
case
and
passed
to
the
serious
one
,
that
is
,
*NL*
to
the
question
of
most
importance
,
concerning
the
three
thousand
roubles
.
*NL*
Grushenka
confirmed
the
statement
that
three
thousand
roubles
had
*NL*
certainly
been
spent
on
the
first
carousal
at
Mokroe
,
and
,
though
she
had
*NL*
not
counted
the
money
herself
,
she
had
heard
that
it
was
three
thousand
*NL*
from
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
's
own
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
tell
you
that
alone
,
or
before
some
one
else
,
or
did
you
only
hear
*NL*
him
speak
of
it
to
others
in
your
presence
?
''
the
prosecutor
inquired
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Grushenka
replied
that
she
had
heard
him
say
so
before
other
*NL*
people
,
and
had
heard
him
say
so
when
they
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
say
it
to
you
alone
once
,
or
several
times
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
prosecutor
,
and
learned
that
he
had
told
Grushenka
so
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
piece
of
evidence
.
*NL*
Further
examination
elicited
that
Grushenka
knew
,
too
,
where
that
money
*NL*
had
come
from
,
and
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
had
got
it
from
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
never
,
once
,
hear
that
the
money
spent
a
month
ago
was
not
*NL*
three
thousand
,
but
less
,
and
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
had
saved
half
that
*NL*
sum
for
his
own
use
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
never
heard
that
,
''
answered
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
explained
further
that
Mitya
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
often
told
her
*NL*
that
he
had
n't
a
farthing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
always
expecting
to
get
some
from
his
father
,
''
said
Grushenka
in
*NL*
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
never
say
before
you
...
casually
,
or
in
a
moment
of
irritation
,
''
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
put
in
suddenly
,
``
that
he
intended
to
make
an
attempt
*NL*
on
his
father
's
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
he
did
say
so
,
''
sighed
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
or
several
times
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
mentioned
it
several
times
,
always
in
anger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
believe
he
would
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
never
believed
it
,
''
she
answered
firmly
.
``
I
had
faith
in
his
noble
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
allow
me
,
''
cried
Mitya
suddenly
,
``
allow
me
to
say
one
word
to
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
in
your
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
speak
,
''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
!
''
Mitya
got
up
from
his
chair
,
``
have
faith
in
God
*NL*
and
in
me
.
I
am
not
guilty
of
my
father
's
murder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
uttered
these
words
Mitya
sat
down
again
on
his
chair
.
Grushenka
*NL*
stood
up
and
crossed
herself
devoutly
before
the
ikon
.
``
Thanks
be
to
Thee
,
*NL*
O
Lord
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
thrilled
with
emotion
,
and
still
standing
,
*NL*
she
turned
to
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
and
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
he
has
spoken
now
,
believe
it
!
I
know
him
.
He
'll
say
anything
as
a
*NL*
joke
or
from
obstinacy
,
but
he
'll
never
deceive
you
against
his
*NL*
conscience
.
He
's
telling
the
whole
truth
,
you
may
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
you
've
given
me
fresh
courage
,
''
Mitya
*NL*
responded
in
a
quivering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
money
spent
the
previous
day
,
she
declared
that
she
did
not
know
*NL*
what
sum
it
was
,
but
had
heard
him
tell
several
people
that
he
had
three
*NL*
thousand
with
him
.
And
to
the
question
where
he
got
the
money
,
she
said
*NL*
that
he
had
told
her
that
he
had
``
stolen
''
it
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
*NL*
that
she
had
replied
to
that
that
he
had
n't
stolen
it
,
and
that
he
must
*NL*
pay
the
money
back
next
day
.
On
the
prosecutor
's
asking
her
emphatically
*NL*
whether
the
money
he
said
he
had
stolen
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
what
he
*NL*
had
spent
yesterday
,
or
what
he
had
squandered
here
a
month
ago
,
she
*NL*
declared
that
he
meant
the
money
spent
a
month
ago
,
and
that
that
was
how
*NL*
she
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
was
at
last
released
,
and
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
informed
her
*NL*
impulsively
that
she
might
at
once
return
to
the
town
and
that
if
he
could
*NL*
be
of
any
assistance
to
her
,
with
horses
for
example
,
or
if
she
would
care
*NL*
for
an
escort
,
he
...
would
be
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
sincerely
,
''
said
Grushenka
,
bowing
to
him
,
``
I
'm
going
with
*NL*
this
old
gentleman
,
I
am
driving
him
back
to
town
with
me
,
and
meanwhile
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
I
'll
wait
below
to
hear
what
you
decide
about
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
.
Mitya
was
calm
,
and
even
looked
more
cheerful
,
but
only
for
*NL*
a
moment
.
He
felt
more
and
more
oppressed
by
a
strange
physical
weakness
.
*NL*
His
eyes
were
closing
with
fatigue
.
The
examination
of
the
witnesses
was
,
*NL*
at
last
,
over
.
They
proceeded
to
a
final
revision
of
the
protocol
.
Mitya
*NL*
got
up
,
moved
from
his
chair
to
the
corner
by
the
curtain
,
lay
down
on
a
*NL*
large
chest
covered
with
a
rug
,
and
instantly
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
strange
dream
,
utterly
out
of
keeping
with
the
place
and
the
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
driving
somewhere
in
the
steppes
,
where
he
had
been
stationed
long
*NL*
ago
,
and
a
peasant
was
driving
him
in
a
cart
with
a
pair
of
horses
,
*NL*
through
snow
and
sleet
.
He
was
cold
,
it
was
early
in
November
,
and
the
*NL*
snow
was
falling
in
big
wet
flakes
,
melting
as
soon
as
it
touched
the
*NL*
earth
.
And
the
peasant
drove
him
smartly
,
he
had
a
fair
,
long
beard
.
He
*NL*
was
not
an
old
man
,
somewhere
about
fifty
,
and
he
had
on
a
gray
peasant
's
*NL*
smock
.
Not
far
off
was
a
village
,
he
could
see
the
black
huts
,
and
half
*NL*
the
huts
were
burnt
down
,
there
were
only
the
charred
beams
sticking
up
.
*NL*
And
as
they
drove
in
,
there
were
peasant
women
drawn
up
along
the
road
,
a
*NL*
lot
of
women
,
a
whole
row
,
all
thin
and
wan
,
with
their
faces
a
sort
of
*NL*
brownish
color
,
especially
one
at
the
edge
,
a
tall
,
bony
woman
,
who
looked
*NL*
forty
,
but
might
have
been
only
twenty
,
with
a
long
thin
face
.
And
in
her
*NL*
arms
was
a
little
baby
crying
.
And
her
breasts
seemed
so
dried
up
that
*NL*
there
was
not
a
drop
of
milk
in
them
.
And
the
child
cried
and
cried
,
and
*NL*
held
out
its
little
bare
arms
,
with
its
little
fists
blue
from
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
they
crying
?
Why
are
they
crying
?
''
Mitya
asked
,
as
they
dashed
*NL*
gayly
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
babe
,
''
answered
the
driver
,
``
the
babe
weeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mitya
was
struck
by
his
saying
,
in
his
peasant
way
,
``
the
babe
,
''
and
he
*NL*
liked
the
peasant
's
calling
it
a
``
babe
.
''
There
seemed
more
pity
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
is
it
weeping
?
''
Mitya
persisted
stupidly
,
``
why
are
its
little
*NL*
arms
bare
?
Why
do
n't
they
wrap
it
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
babe
's
cold
,
its
little
clothes
are
frozen
and
do
n't
warm
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
is
it
?
Why
?
''
foolish
Mitya
still
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
they
're
poor
people
,
burnt
out
.
They
've
no
bread
.
They
're
begging
*NL*
because
they
've
been
burnt
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
Mitya
,
as
it
were
,
still
did
not
understand
.
``
Tell
me
why
it
is
*NL*
those
poor
mothers
stand
there
?
Why
are
people
poor
?
Why
is
the
babe
poor
?
*NL*
Why
is
the
steppe
barren
?
Why
do
n't
they
hug
each
other
and
kiss
?
Why
*NL*
do
n't
they
sing
songs
of
joy
?
Why
are
they
so
dark
from
black
misery
?
Why
*NL*
do
n't
they
feed
the
babe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
felt
that
,
though
his
questions
were
unreasonable
and
senseless
,
*NL*
yet
he
wanted
to
ask
just
that
,
and
he
had
to
ask
it
just
in
that
way
.
And
*NL*
he
felt
that
a
passion
of
pity
,
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
,
was
*NL*
rising
in
his
heart
,
that
he
wanted
to
cry
,
that
he
wanted
to
do
something
*NL*
for
them
all
,
so
that
the
babe
should
weep
no
more
,
so
that
the
dark
-
*NL*
faced
,
dried-up
mother
should
not
weep
,
that
no
one
should
shed
tears
*NL*
again
from
that
moment
,
and
he
wanted
to
do
it
at
once
,
at
once
,
*NL*
regardless
of
all
obstacles
,
with
all
the
recklessness
of
the
Karamazovs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
coming
with
you

wo
n't
leave
you
now

rest

*NL*

with
you
,
''
he
heard
close
beside
him
Grushenka
's
tender
voice
,
*NL*
thrilling
with
emotion
.
And
his
heart
glowed
,
and
he
struggled
forward
*NL*
towards
the
light
,
and
he
longed
to
live
,
to
live
,
to
go
on
and
on
,
*NL*
towards
the
new
,
beckoning
light
,
and
to
hasten
,
hasten
,
now
,
at
once
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Where
?
''
he
exclaimed
opening
his
eyes
,
and
sitting
up
on
the
chest
,
*NL*
as
though
he
had
revived
from
a
swoon
,
smiling
brightly
.
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
was
standing
over
him
,
suggesting
that
he
should
hear
the
*NL*
protocol
read
aloud
and
sign
it
.
Mitya
guessed
that
he
had
been
asleep
an
*NL*
hour
or
more
,
but
he
did
not
hear
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
He
was
suddenly
*NL*
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
pillow
under
his
head
,
which
had
n't
*NL*
been
there
when
he
had
leant
back
,
exhausted
,
on
the
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
put
that
pillow
under
my
head
?
Who
was
so
kind
?
''
he
cried
,
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
ecstatic
gratitude
,
and
tears
in
his
voice
,
as
though
some
great
*NL*
kindness
had
been
shown
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
found
out
who
this
kind
man
was
;
perhaps
one
of
the
peasant
*NL*
witnesses
,
or
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
's
little
secretary
,
had
compassionately
*NL*
thought
to
put
a
pillow
under
his
head
;
but
his
whole
soul
was
quivering
*NL*
with
tears
.
He
went
to
the
table
and
said
that
he
would
sign
whatever
they
*NL*
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
a
good
dream
,
gentlemen
,
''
he
said
in
a
strange
voice
,
with
a
new
*NL*
light
,
as
of
joy
,
in
his
face

Away

*NL*
*NL*
When
the
protocol
had
been
signed
,
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
turned
solemnly
to
*NL*
the
prisoner
and
read
him
the
``
Committal
,
''
setting
forth
,
that
in
such
a
*NL*
year

on
such
a
day

in

a

,
the
investigating
lawyer
of

and-such
a

court
,
having
examined
so-and-so

accused

*NL*
and
having
considered
that
the
accused
,
not
pleading
guilty
to
the
charges
*NL*
made
against
him
,
had
brought
forward
nothing
in
his
defense
,
while
the
*NL*
witnesses
,
so-and-so
,
and
so-and-so
,
and
the
circumstances
such-and-such
*NL*
testify
against
him
,
acting
in
accordance
with
such-and-such
articles
of
*NL*
the
Statute
Book
,
and
so
on
,
has
ruled
,
that
,
in
order
to
preclude
so-and

*NL*
so
-LRB-
Mitya
-RRB-
from
all
means
of
evading
pursuit
and
judgment
he
be
detained
*NL*
in
such-and-such
a
prison
,
which
he
hereby
notifies
to
the
accused
and
*NL*
communicates
a
copy
of
this
same
``
Committal
''
to
the
deputy
prosecutor
,
and
*NL*
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
brief
,
Mitya
was
informed
that
he
was
,
from
that
moment
,
a
prisoner
,
*NL*
and
that
he
would
be
driven
at
once
to
the
town
,
and
there
shut
up
in
a
*NL*
very
unpleasant
place
.
Mitya
listened
attentively
,
and
only
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
I
do
n't
blame
you
.
I
'm
ready
...
I
understand
that
*NL*
there
's
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
informed
him
gently
that
he
would
be
escorted
at
once
*NL*
by
the
rural
police
officer
,
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
,
who
happened
to
be
on
*NL*
the
spot
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
''
Mitya
interrupted
,
suddenly
,
and
impelled
by
uncontrollable
*NL*
feeling
he
pronounced
,
addressing
all
in
the
room
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
we
're
all
cruel
,
we
're
all
monsters
,
we
all
make
men
weep
,
and
*NL*
mothers
,
and
babes
at
the
breast
,
but
of
all
,
let
it
be
settled
here
,
now
,
*NL*
of
all
I
am
the
lowest
reptile
!
I
've
sworn
to
amend
,
and
every
day
I
've
*NL*
done
the
same
filthy
things
.
I
understand
now
that
such
men
as
I
need
a
*NL*
blow
,
a
blow
of
destiny
to
catch
them
as
with
a
noose
,
and
bind
them
by
a
*NL*
force
from
without
.
Never
,
never
should
I
have
risen
of
myself
!
But
the
*NL*
thunderbolt
has
fallen
.
I
accept
the
torture
of
accusation
,
and
my
public
*NL*
shame
,
I
want
to
suffer
and
by
suffering
I
shall
be
purified
.
Perhaps
I
*NL*
shall
be
purified
,
gentlemen
?
But
listen
,
for
the
last
time
,
I
am
not
*NL*
guilty
of
my
father
's
blood
.
I
accept
my
punishment
,
not
because
I
killed
*NL*
him
,
but
because
I
meant
to
kill
him
,
and
perhaps
I
really
might
have
*NL*
killed
him
.
Still
I
mean
to
fight
it
out
with
you
.
I
warn
you
of
that
.
*NL*
I
'll
fight
it
out
with
you
to
the
end
,
and
then
God
will
decide
.
Good-by
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
do
n't
be
vexed
with
me
for
having
shouted
at
you
during
the
*NL*
examination
.
Oh
,
I
was
still
such
a
fool
then
...
In
another
minute
I
*NL*
shall
be
a
prisoner
,
but
now
,
for
the
last
time
,
as
a
free
man
,
Dmitri
*NL*
Karamazov
offers
you
his
hand
.
Saying
good-by
to
you
,
I
say
it
to
all
*NL*
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
quivered
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
,
but
Nikolay
*NL*
Parfenovitch
,
who
happened
to
stand
nearest
to
him
,
with
a
sudden
,
almost
*NL*
nervous
movement
,
hid
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
Mitya
instantly
noticed
*NL*
this
,
and
started
.
He
let
his
outstretched
hand
fall
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
preliminary
inquiry
is
not
yet
over
,
''
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
faltered
,
*NL*
somewhat
embarrassed
.
``
We
will
continue
it
in
the
town
,
and
I
,
for
my
*NL*
part
,
of
course
,
am
ready
to
wish
you
all
success
...
in
your
defense
...
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
I
've
always
been
disposed
to
*NL*
regard
you
as
,
so
to
speak
,
more
unfortunate
than
guilty
.
All
of
us
here
,
*NL*
if
I
may
make
bold
to
speak
for
all
,
we
are
all
ready
to
recognize
that
*NL*
you
are
,
at
bottom
,
a
young
man
of
honor
,
but
,
alas
,
one
who
has
been
*NL*
carried
away
by
certain
passions
to
a
somewhat
excessive
degree
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
's
little
figure
was
positively
majestic
by
the
time
*NL*
he
had
finished
speaking
.
It
struck
Mitya
that
in
another
minute
this
*NL*
``
boy
''
would
take
his
arm
,
lead
him
to
another
corner
,
and
renew
their
*NL*
conversation
about
``
girls
.
''
But
many
quite
irrelevant
and
inappropriate
*NL*
thoughts
sometimes
occur
even
to
a
prisoner
when
he
is
being
led
out
to
*NL*
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
you
are
good
,
you
are
humane
,
may
I
see
_
her
_
to
say
`
good-by
'
*NL*
for
the
last
time
?
''
asked
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
but
considering
...
in
fact
,
now
it
's
impossible
except
in
the
*NL*
presence
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
if
it
must
be
so
,
it
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
was
brought
in
,
but
the
farewell
was
brief
,
and
of
few
words
,
*NL*
and
did
not
at
all
satisfy
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
.
Grushenka
made
a
deep
bow
*NL*
to
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
I
am
yours
,
and
I
will
be
yours
.
I
will
follow
you
for
*NL*
ever
,
wherever
they
may
send
you
.
Farewell
;
you
are
guiltless
,
though
*NL*
you
've
been
your
own
undoing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lips
quivered
,
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
Grusha
,
for
my
love
,
for
ruining
you
,
too
,
with
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
would
have
said
something
more
,
but
he
broke
off
and
went
out
.
He
*NL*
was
at
once
surrounded
by
men
who
kept
a
constant
watch
on
him
.
At
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
steps
to
which
he
had
driven
up
with
such
a
dash
the
day
*NL*
before
with
Andrey
's
three
horses
,
two
carts
stood
in
readiness
.
Mavriky
*NL*
Mavrikyevitch
,
a
sturdy
,
thick-set
man
with
a
wrinkled
face
,
was
annoyed
*NL*
about
something
,
some
sudden
irregularity
.
He
was
shouting
angrily
.
He
*NL*
asked
Mitya
to
get
into
the
cart
with
somewhat
excessive
surliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
stood
him
drinks
in
the
tavern
,
the
man
had
quite
a
different
*NL*
face
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
as
he
got
in
.
At
the
gates
there
was
a
crowd
of
*NL*
people
,
peasants
,
women
and
drivers
.
Trifon
Borissovitch
came
down
the
*NL*
steps
too
.
All
stared
at
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
at
parting
,
good
people
!
''
Mitya
shouted
suddenly
from
the
*NL*
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
us
too
!
''
he
heard
two
or
three
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
to
you
,
too
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Trifon
Borissovitch
did
not
even
turn
round
.
He
was
,
perhaps
,
too
*NL*
busy
.
He
,
too
,
was
shouting
and
fussing
about
something
.
It
appeared
that
*NL*
everything
was
not
yet
ready
in
the
second
cart
,
in
which
two
constables
*NL*
were
to
accompany
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
.
The
peasant
who
had
been
ordered
*NL*
to
drive
the
second
cart
was
pulling
on
his
smock
,
stoutly
maintaining
*NL*
that
it
was
not
his
turn
to
go
,
but
Akim
's
.
But
Akim
was
not
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
They
ran
to
look
for
him
.
The
peasant
persisted
and
besought
them
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
what
our
peasants
are
,
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
.
They
've
no
shame
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Trifon
Borissovitch
.
``
Akim
gave
you
twenty-five
copecks
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
.
You
've
drunk
it
all
and
now
you
cry
out
.
I
'm
simply
*NL*
surprised
at
your
good-nature
,
with
our
low
peasants
,
Mavriky
*NL*
Mavrikyevitch
,
that
's
all
I
can
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
we
want
a
second
cart
for
?
''
Mitya
put
in
.
``
Let
's
start
with
*NL*
the
one
,
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
.
I
wo
n't
be
unruly
,
I
wo
n't
run
away
from
*NL*
you
,
old
fellow
.
What
do
we
want
an
escort
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
trouble
you
,
sir
,
to
learn
how
to
speak
to
me
if
you
've
never
been
*NL*
taught
.
I
'm
not
`
old
fellow
'
to
you
,
and
you
can
keep
your
advice
for
*NL*
another
time
!
''
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
snapped
out
savagely
,
as
though
glad
*NL*
to
vent
his
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
reduced
to
silence
.
He
flushed
all
over
.
A
moment
later
he
felt
*NL*
suddenly
very
cold
.
The
rain
had
ceased
,
but
the
dull
sky
was
still
*NL*
overcast
with
clouds
,
and
a
keen
wind
was
blowing
straight
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
taken
a
chill
,
''
thought
Mitya
,
twitching
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mavriky
Mavrikyevitch
,
too
,
got
into
the
cart
,
sat
down
heavily
,
*NL*
and
,
as
though
without
noticing
it
,
squeezed
Mitya
into
the
corner
.
It
is
*NL*
true
that
he
was
out
of
humor
and
greatly
disliked
the
task
that
had
been
*NL*
laid
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
!
''
Mitya
shouted
again
,
and
felt
himself
,
*NL*
that
he
had
not
called
out
this
time
from
good-nature
,
but
involuntarily
,
*NL*
from
resentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Trifon
Borissovitch
stood
proudly
,
with
both
hands
behind
his
back
,
*NL*
and
staring
straight
at
Mitya
with
a
stern
and
angry
face
,
he
made
no
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
good-by
!
''
he
heard
all
at
once
the
voice
of
*NL*
Kalganov
,
who
had
suddenly
darted
out
.
Running
up
to
the
cart
he
held
out
*NL*
his
hand
to
Mitya
.
He
had
no
cap
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
had
time
to
seize
and
press
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
dear
fellow
!
I
sha
n't
forget
your
generosity
,
''
he
cried
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
cart
moved
and
their
hands
parted
.
The
bell
began
ringing
and
*NL*
Mitya
was
driven
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kalganov
ran
back
,
sat
down
in
a
corner
,
bent
his
head
,
hid
his
face
in
*NL*
his
hands
,
and
burst
out
crying
.
For
a
long
while
he
sat
like
that
,
crying
*NL*
as
though
he
were
a
little
boy
instead
of
a
young
man
of
twenty
.
Oh
,
he
*NL*
believed
almost
without
doubt
in
Mitya
's
guilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
these
people
?
What
can
men
be
after
this
?
''
he
exclaimed
*NL*
incoherently
,
in
bitter
despondency
,
almost
despair
.
At
that
moment
he
had
*NL*
no
desire
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
worth
it
?
Is
it
worth
it
?
''
exclaimed
the
boy
in
his
grief
.

Chapter
I.
Kolya

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
November
.
There
had
been
a
hard
frost
,
eleven
*NL*
degrees
Reaumur
,
without
snow
,
but
a
little
dry
snow
had
fallen
on
the
*NL*
frozen
ground
during
the
night
,
and
a
keen
dry
wind
was
lifting
and
*NL*
blowing
it
along
the
dreary
streets
of
our
town
,
especially
about
the
*NL*
market-place
.
It
was
a
dull
morning
,
but
the
snow
had
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
far
from
the
market-place
,
close
to
Plotnikov
's
shop
,
there
stood
a
*NL*
small
house
,
very
clean
both
without
and
within
.
It
belonged
to
Madame
*NL*
Krassotkin
,
the
widow
of
a
former
provincial
secretary
,
who
had
been
dead
*NL*
for
fourteen
years
.
His
widow
,
still
a
nice-looking
woman
of
thirty-two
,
*NL*
was
living
in
her
neat
little
house
on
her
private
means
.
She
lived
in
*NL*
respectable
seclusion
;
she
was
of
a
soft
but
fairly
cheerful
disposition
.
*NL*
She
was
about
eighteen
at
the
time
of
her
husband
's
death
;
she
had
been
*NL*
married
only
a
year
and
had
just
borne
him
a
son
.
From
the
day
of
his
*NL*
death
she
had
devoted
herself
heart
and
soul
to
the
bringing
up
of
her
*NL*
precious
treasure
,
her
boy
Kolya
.
Though
she
had
loved
him
passionately
*NL*
those
fourteen
years
,
he
had
caused
her
far
more
suffering
than
happiness
.
*NL*
She
had
been
trembling
and
fainting
with
terror
almost
every
day
,
afraid
*NL*
he
would
fall
ill
,
would
catch
cold
,
do
something
naughty
,
climb
on
a
*NL*
chair
and
fall
off
it
,
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
When
Kolya
began
going
to
*NL*
school
,
the
mother
devoted
herself
to
studying
all
the
sciences
with
him
*NL*
so
as
to
help
him
,
and
go
through
his
lessons
with
him
.
She
hastened
to
*NL*
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
teachers
and
their
wives
,
even
made
up
to
*NL*
Kolya
's
schoolfellows
,
and
fawned
upon
them
in
the
hope
of
thus
saving
*NL*
Kolya
from
being
teased
,
laughed
at
,
or
beaten
by
them
.
She
went
so
far
*NL*
that
the
boys
actually
began
to
mock
at
him
on
her
account
and
taunt
him
*NL*
with
being
a
``
mother
's
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
boy
could
take
his
own
part
.
He
was
a
resolute
boy
,
``
tremendously
*NL*
strong
,
''
as
was
rumored
in
his
class
,
and
soon
proved
to
be
the
fact
;
he
*NL*
was
agile
,
strong-willed
,
and
of
an
audacious
and
enterprising
temper
.
He
*NL*
was
good
at
lessons
,
and
there
was
a
rumor
in
the
school
that
he
could
*NL*
beat
the
teacher
,
Dardanelov
,
at
arithmetic
and
universal
history
.
Though
*NL*
he
looked
down
upon
every
one
,
he
was
a
good
comrade
and
not
supercilious
.
*NL*
He
accepted
his
schoolfellows
'
respect
as
his
due
,
but
was
friendly
with
*NL*
them
.
Above
all
,
he
knew
where
to
draw
the
line
.
He
could
restrain
himself
*NL*
on
occasion
,
and
in
his
relations
with
the
teachers
he
never
overstepped
*NL*
that
last
mystic
limit
beyond
which
a
prank
becomes
an
unpardonable
breach
*NL*
of
discipline
.
But
he
was
as
fond
of
mischief
on
every
possible
occasion
*NL*
as
the
smallest
boy
in
the
school
,
and
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
mischief
as
for
creating
a
sensation
,
inventing
something
,
something
*NL*
effective
and
conspicuous
.
He
was
extremely
vain
.
He
knew
how
to
make
even
*NL*
his
mother
give
way
to
him
;
he
was
almost
despotic
in
his
control
of
her
.
*NL*
She
gave
way
to
him
,
oh
,
she
had
given
way
to
him
for
years
.
The
one
*NL*
thought
unendurable
to
her
was
that
her
boy
had
no
great
love
for
her
.
She
*NL*
was
always
fancying
that
Kolya
was
``
unfeeling
''
to
her
,
and
at
times
,
*NL*
dissolving
into
hysterical
tears
,
she
used
to
reproach
him
with
his
*NL*
coldness
.
The
boy
disliked
this
,
and
the
more
demonstrations
of
feeling
*NL*
were
demanded
of
him
the
more
he
seemed
intentionally
to
avoid
them
.
Yet
*NL*
it
was
not
intentional
on
his
part
but
instinctive
--
it
was
his
character
.
*NL*
His
mother
was
mistaken
;
he
was
very
fond
of
her
.
He
only
disliked
*NL*
``
sheepish
sentimentality
,
''
as
he
expressed
it
in
his
schoolboy
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bookcase
in
the
house
containing
a
few
books
that
had
been
his
*NL*
father
's
.
Kolya
was
fond
of
reading
,
and
had
read
several
of
them
by
*NL*
himself
.
His
mother
did
not
mind
that
and
only
wondered
sometimes
at
*NL*
seeing
the
boy
stand
for
hours
by
the
bookcase
poring
over
a
book
instead
*NL*
of
going
to
play
.
And
in
that
way
Kolya
read
some
things
unsuitable
for
*NL*
his
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
boy
,
as
a
rule
,
knew
where
to
draw
the
line
in
his
mischief
,
he
*NL*
had
of
late
begun
to
play
pranks
that
caused
his
mother
serious
alarm
.
It
*NL*
is
true
there
was
nothing
vicious
in
what
he
did
,
but
a
wild
mad
*NL*
recklessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
July
,
during
the
summer
holidays
,
that
the
mother
and
son
*NL*
went
to
another
district
,
forty-five
miles
away
,
to
spend
a
week
with
a
*NL*
distant
relation
,
whose
husband
was
an
official
at
the
railway
station
*NL*
-LRB-
the
very
station
,
the
nearest
one
to
our
town
,
from
which
a
month
later
*NL*
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
set
off
for
Moscow
-RRB-
.
There
Kolya
began
by
*NL*
carefully
investigating
every
detail
connected
with
the
railways
,
knowing
*NL*
that
he
could
impress
his
schoolfellows
when
he
got
home
with
his
newly
*NL*
acquired
knowledge
.
But
there
happened
to
be
some
other
boys
in
the
place
*NL*
with
whom
he
soon
made
friends
.
Some
of
them
were
living
at
the
station
,
*NL*
others
in
the
neighborhood
;
there
were
six
or
seven
of
them
,
all
between
*NL*
twelve
and
fifteen
,
and
two
of
them
came
from
our
town
.
The
boys
played
*NL*
together
,
and
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
of
Kolya
's
stay
at
the
station
,
a
*NL*
mad
bet
was
made
by
the
foolish
boys
.
Kolya
,
who
was
almost
the
youngest
*NL*
of
the
party
and
rather
looked
down
upon
by
the
others
in
consequence
,
was
*NL*
moved
by
vanity
or
by
reckless
bravado
to
bet
them
two
roubles
that
he
*NL*
would
lie
down
between
the
rails
at
night
when
the
eleven
o'clock
train
*NL*
was
due
,
and
would
lie
there
without
moving
while
the
train
rolled
over
*NL*
him
at
full
speed
.
It
is
true
they
made
a
preliminary
investigation
,
from
*NL*
which
it
appeared
that
it
was
possible
to
lie
so
flat
between
the
rails
*NL*
that
the
train
could
pass
over
without
touching
,
but
to
lie
there
was
no
*NL*
joke
!
Kolya
maintained
stoutly
that
he
would
.
At
first
they
laughed
at
*NL*
him
,
called
him
a
little
liar
,
a
braggart
,
but
that
only
egged
him
on
.
*NL*
What
piqued
him
most
was
that
these
boys
of
fifteen
turned
up
their
noses
*NL*
at
him
too
superciliously
,
and
were
at
first
disposed
to
treat
him
as
``
a
*NL*
small
boy
,
''
not
fit
to
associate
with
them
,
and
that
was
an
unendurable
*NL*
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
resolved
to
go
in
the
evening
,
half
a
mile
from
the
station
,
*NL*
so
that
the
train
might
have
time
to
get
up
full
speed
after
leaving
the
*NL*
station
.
The
boys
assembled
.
It
was
a
pitch-dark
night
without
a
moon
.
At
*NL*
the
time
fixed
,
Kolya
lay
down
between
the
rails
.
The
five
others
who
had
*NL*
taken
the
bet
waited
among
the
bushes
below
the
embankment
,
their
hearts
*NL*
beating
with
suspense
,
which
was
followed
by
alarm
and
remorse
.
At
last
*NL*
they
heard
in
the
distance
the
rumble
of
the
train
leaving
the
station
.
*NL*
Two
red
lights
gleamed
out
of
the
darkness
;
the
monster
roared
as
it
*NL*
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
,
run
away
from
the
rails
,
''
the
boys
cried
to
Kolya
from
the
bushes
,
*NL*
breathless
with
terror
.
But
it
was
too
late
:
the
train
darted
up
and
flew
*NL*
past
.
The
boys
rushed
to
Kolya
.
He
lay
without
moving
.
They
began
pulling
*NL*
at
him
,
lifting
him
up
.
He
suddenly
got
up
and
walked
away
without
a
word
.
*NL*
Then
he
explained
that
he
had
lain
there
as
though
he
were
insensible
to
*NL*
frighten
them
,
but
the
fact
was
that
he
really
had
lost
consciousness
,
as
*NL*
he
confessed
long
after
to
his
mother
.
In
this
way
his
reputation
as
``
a
*NL*
desperate
character
,
''
was
established
for
ever
.
He
returned
home
to
the
*NL*
station
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
Next
day
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
nervous
*NL*
fever
,
but
he
was
in
high
spirits
and
well
pleased
with
himself
.
The
*NL*
incident
did
not
become
known
at
once
,
but
when
they
came
back
to
the
town
*NL*
it
penetrated
to
the
school
and
even
reached
the
ears
of
the
masters
.
But
*NL*
then
Kolya
's
mother
hastened
to
entreat
the
masters
on
her
boy
's
behalf
,
*NL*
and
in
the
end
Dardanelov
,
a
respected
and
influential
teacher
,
exerted
*NL*
himself
in
his
favor
,
and
the
affair
was
ignored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dardanelov
was
a
middle-aged
bachelor
,
who
had
been
passionately
in
love
*NL*
with
Madame
Krassotkin
for
many
years
past
,
and
had
once
already
,
about
a
*NL*
year
previously
,
ventured
,
trembling
with
fear
and
the
delicacy
of
his
*NL*
sentiments
,
to
offer
her
most
respectfully
his
hand
in
marriage
.
But
she
*NL*
refused
him
resolutely
,
feeling
that
to
accept
him
would
be
an
act
of
*NL*
treachery
to
her
son
,
though
Dardanelov
had
,
to
judge
from
certain
*NL*
mysterious
symptoms
,
reason
for
believing
that
he
was
not
an
object
of
*NL*
aversion
to
the
charming
but
too
chaste
and
tender-hearted
widow
.
Kolya
's
*NL*
mad
prank
seemed
to
have
broken
the
ice
,
and
Dardanelov
was
rewarded
for
*NL*
his
intercession
by
a
suggestion
of
hope
.
The
suggestion
,
it
is
true
,
was
*NL*
a
faint
one
,
but
then
Dardanelov
was
such
a
paragon
of
purity
and
delicacy
*NL*
that
it
was
enough
for
the
time
being
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
.
He
was
*NL*
fond
of
the
boy
,
though
he
would
have
felt
it
beneath
him
to
try
and
win
*NL*
him
over
,
and
was
severe
and
strict
with
him
in
class
.
Kolya
,
too
,
kept
*NL*
him
at
a
respectful
distance
.
He
learned
his
lessons
perfectly
;
he
was
*NL*
second
in
his
class
,
was
reserved
with
Dardanelov
,
and
the
whole
class
*NL*
firmly
believed
that
Kolya
was
so
good
at
universal
history
that
he
could
*NL*
``
beat
''
even
Dardanelov
.
Kolya
did
indeed
ask
him
the
question
,
``
Who
*NL*
founded
Troy
?
''
to
which
Dardanelov
had
made
a
very
vague
reply
,
referring
*NL*
to
the
movements
and
migrations
of
races
,
to
the
remoteness
of
the
period
,
*NL*
to
the
mythical
legends
.
But
the
question
,
``
Who
had
founded
Troy
?
''
that
*NL*
is
,
what
individuals
,
he
could
not
answer
,
and
even
for
some
reason
*NL*
regarded
the
question
as
idle
and
frivolous
.
But
the
boys
remained
*NL*
convinced
that
Dardanelov
did
not
know
who
founded
Troy
.
Kolya
had
read
of
*NL*
the
founders
of
Troy
in
Smaragdov
,
whose
history
was
among
the
books
in
*NL*
his
father
's
bookcase
.
In
the
end
all
the
boys
became
interested
in
the
*NL*
question
,
who
it
was
that
had
founded
Troy
,
but
Krassotkin
would
not
tell
*NL*
his
secret
,
and
his
reputation
for
knowledge
remained
unshaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
incident
on
the
railway
a
certain
change
came
over
Kolya
's
*NL*
attitude
to
his
mother
.
When
Anna
Fyodorovna
-LRB-
Madame
Krassotkin
-RRB-
heard
of
*NL*
her
son
's
exploit
,
she
almost
went
out
of
her
mind
with
horror
.
She
had
*NL*
such
terrible
attacks
of
hysterics
,
lasting
with
intervals
for
several
*NL*
days
,
that
Kolya
,
seriously
alarmed
at
last
,
promised
on
his
honor
that
*NL*
such
pranks
should
never
be
repeated
.
He
swore
on
his
knees
before
the
*NL*
holy
image
,
and
swore
by
the
memory
of
his
father
,
at
Madame
Krassotkin
's
*NL*
instance
,
and
the
``
manly
''
Kolya
burst
into
tears
like
a
boy
of
six
.
And
*NL*
all
that
day
the
mother
and
son
were
constantly
rushing
into
each
other
's
*NL*
arms
sobbing
.
Next
day
Kolya
woke
up
as
``
unfeeling
''
as
before
,
but
he
had
*NL*
become
more
silent
,
more
modest
,
sterner
,
and
more
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
weeks
later
,
it
is
true
,
he
got
into
another
scrape
,
which
even
*NL*
brought
his
name
to
the
ears
of
our
Justice
of
the
Peace
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
scrape
of
quite
another
kind
,
amusing
,
foolish
,
and
he
did
not
,
as
it
*NL*
turned
out
,
take
the
leading
part
in
it
,
but
was
only
implicated
in
it
.
*NL*
But
of
this
later
.
His
mother
still
fretted
and
trembled
,
but
the
more
*NL*
uneasy
she
became
,
the
greater
were
the
hopes
of
Dardanelov
.
It
must
be
*NL*
noted
that
Kolya
understood
and
divined
what
was
in
Dardanelov
's
heart
*NL*
and
,
of
course
,
despised
him
profoundly
for
his
``
feelings
''
;
he
had
in
the
*NL*
past
been
so
tactless
as
to
show
this
contempt
before
his
mother
,
hinting
*NL*
vaguely
that
he
knew
what
Dardanelov
was
after
.
But
from
the
time
of
the
*NL*
railway
incident
his
behavior
in
this
respect
also
was
changed
;
he
did
not
*NL*
allow
himself
the
remotest
allusion
to
the
subject
and
began
to
speak
more
*NL*
respectfully
of
Dardanelov
before
his
mother
,
which
the
sensitive
woman
at
*NL*
once
appreciated
with
boundless
gratitude
.
But
at
the
slightest
mention
of
*NL*
Dardanelov
by
a
visitor
in
Kolya
's
presence
,
she
would
flush
as
pink
as
a
*NL*
rose
.
At
such
moments
Kolya
would
either
stare
out
of
the
window
scowling
,
*NL*
or
would
investigate
the
state
of
his
boots
,
or
would
shout
angrily
for
*NL*
``
Perezvon
,
''
the
big
,
shaggy
,
mangy
dog
,
which
he
had
picked
up
a
month
*NL*
before
,
brought
home
,
and
kept
for
some
reason
secretly
indoors
,
not
*NL*
showing
him
to
any
of
his
schoolfellows
.
He
bullied
him
frightfully
,
*NL*
teaching
him
all
sorts
of
tricks
,
so
that
the
poor
dog
howled
for
him
*NL*
whenever
he
was
absent
at
school
,
and
when
he
came
in
,
whined
with
*NL*
delight
,
rushed
about
as
if
he
were
crazy
,
begged
,
lay
down
on
the
ground
*NL*
pretending
to
be
dead
,
and
so
on
;
in
fact
,
showed
all
the
tricks
he
had
*NL*
taught
him
,
not
at
the
word
of
command
,
but
simply
from
the
zeal
of
his
*NL*
excited
and
grateful
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
forgotten
,
by
the
way
,
to
mention
that
Kolya
Krassotkin
was
the
boy
*NL*
stabbed
with
a
penknife
by
the
boy
already
known
to
the
reader
as
the
son
*NL*
of
Captain
Snegiryov
.
Ilusha
had
been
defending
his
father
when
the
*NL*
schoolboys
jeered
at
him
,
shouting
the
nickname
``
wisp
of
tow
.

*NL*
And
so
on
that
frosty
,
snowy
,
and
windy
day
in
November
,
Kolya
Krassotkin
*NL*
was
sitting
at
home
.
It
was
Sunday
and
there
was
no
school
.
It
had
just
*NL*
struck
eleven
,
and
he
particularly
wanted
to
go
out
``
on
very
urgent
*NL*
business
,
''
but
he
was
left
alone
in
charge
of
the
house
,
for
it
so
*NL*
happened
that
all
its
elder
inmates
were
absent
owing
to
a
sudden
and
*NL*
singular
event
.
Madame
Krassotkin
had
let
two
little
rooms
,
separated
from
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
house
by
a
passage
,
to
a
doctor
's
wife
with
her
two
small
*NL*
children
.
This
lady
was
the
same
age
as
Anna
Fyodorovna
,
and
a
great
*NL*
friend
of
hers
.
Her
husband
,
the
doctor
,
had
taken
his
departure
twelve
*NL*
months
before
,
going
first
to
Orenburg
and
then
to
Tashkend
,
and
for
the
*NL*
last
six
months
she
had
not
heard
a
word
from
him
.
Had
it
not
been
for
her
*NL*
friendship
with
Madame
Krassotkin
,
which
was
some
consolation
to
the
*NL*
forsaken
lady
,
she
would
certainly
have
completely
dissolved
away
in
*NL*
tears
.
And
now
,
to
add
to
her
misfortunes
,
Katerina
,
her
only
servant
,
was
*NL*
suddenly
moved
the
evening
before
to
announce
,
to
her
mistress
's
*NL*
amazement
,
that
she
proposed
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
before
*NL*
morning
.
It
seemed
almost
miraculous
to
every
one
that
no
one
had
noticed
*NL*
the
probability
of
it
before
.
The
astounded
doctor
's
wife
decided
to
move
*NL*
Katerina
while
there
was
still
time
to
an
establishment
in
the
town
kept
*NL*
by
a
midwife
for
such
emergencies
.
As
she
set
great
store
by
her
servant
,
*NL*
she
promptly
carried
out
this
plan
and
remained
there
looking
after
her
.
*NL*
By
the
morning
all
Madame
Krassotkin
's
friendly
sympathy
and
energy
were
*NL*
called
upon
to
render
assistance
and
appeal
to
some
one
for
help
in
the
*NL*
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
both
the
ladies
were
absent
from
home
,
the
Krassotkins
'
servant
,
*NL*
Agafya
,
had
gone
out
to
the
market
,
and
Kolya
was
thus
left
for
a
time
to
*NL*
protect
and
look
after
``
the
kids
,
''
that
is
,
the
son
and
daughter
of
the
*NL*
doctor
's
wife
,
who
were
left
alone
.
Kolya
was
not
afraid
of
taking
care
of
*NL*
the
house
,
besides
he
had
Perezvon
,
who
had
been
told
to
lie
flat
,
without
*NL*
moving
,
under
the
bench
in
the
hall
.
Every
time
Kolya
,
walking
to
and
fro
*NL*
through
the
rooms
,
came
into
the
hall
,
the
dog
shook
his
head
and
gave
two
*NL*
loud
and
insinuating
taps
on
the
floor
with
his
tail
,
but
alas
!
the
*NL*
whistle
did
not
sound
to
release
him
.
Kolya
looked
sternly
at
the
luckless
*NL*
dog
,
who
relapsed
again
into
obedient
rigidity
.
The
one
thing
that
*NL*
troubled
Kolya
was
``
the
kids
.
''
He
looked
,
of
course
,
with
the
utmost
scorn
*NL*
on
Katerina
's
unexpected
adventure
,
but
he
was
very
fond
of
the
bereaved
*NL*
``
kiddies
,
''
and
had
already
taken
them
a
picture-book
.
Nastya
,
the
elder
,
a
*NL*
girl
of
eight
,
could
read
,
and
Kostya
,
the
boy
,
aged
seven
,
was
very
fond
*NL*
of
being
read
to
by
her
.
Krassotkin
could
,
of
course
,
have
provided
more
*NL*
diverting
entertainment
for
them
.
He
could
have
made
them
stand
side
by
*NL*
side
and
played
soldiers
with
them
,
or
sent
them
hiding
all
over
the
*NL*
house
.
He
had
done
so
more
than
once
before
and
was
not
above
doing
it
,
so
*NL*
much
so
that
a
report
once
spread
at
school
that
Krassotkin
played
horses
*NL*
with
the
little
lodgers
at
home
,
prancing
with
his
head
on
one
side
like
a
*NL*
trace-horse
.
But
Krassotkin
haughtily
parried
this
thrust
,
pointing
out
*NL*
that
to
play
horses
with
boys
of
one
's
own
age
,
boys
of
thirteen
,
would
*NL*
certainly
be
disgraceful
``
at
this
date
,
''
but
that
he
did
it
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
``
the
kids
''
because
he
liked
them
,
and
no
one
had
a
right
to
call
him
to
*NL*
account
for
his
feelings
.
The
two
``
kids
''
adored
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
occasion
he
was
in
no
mood
for
games
.
He
had
very
important
*NL*
business
of
his
own
before
him
,
something
almost
mysterious
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
time
was
passing
and
Agafya
,
with
whom
he
could
have
left
the
children
,
*NL*
would
not
come
back
from
market
.
He
had
several
times
already
crossed
the
*NL*
passage
,
opened
the
door
of
the
lodgers
'
room
and
looked
anxiously
at
``
the
*NL*
kids
''
who
were
sitting
over
the
book
,
as
he
had
bidden
them
.
Every
time
he
*NL*
opened
the
door
they
grinned
at
him
,
hoping
he
would
come
in
and
would
do
*NL*
something
delightful
and
amusing
.
But
Kolya
was
bothered
and
did
not
go
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
it
struck
eleven
and
he
made
up
his
mind
,
once
for
all
,
that
if
*NL*
that
``
damned
''
Agafya
did
not
come
back
within
ten
minutes
he
should
go
out
*NL*
without
waiting
for
her
,
making
``
the
kids
''
promise
,
of
course
,
to
be
brave
*NL*
when
he
was
away
,
not
to
be
naughty
,
not
to
cry
from
fright
.
With
this
*NL*
idea
he
put
on
his
wadded
winter
overcoat
with
its
catskin
fur
collar
,
*NL*
slung
his
satchel
round
his
shoulder
,
and
,
regardless
of
his
mother
's
*NL*
constantly
reiterated
entreaties
that
he
would
always
put
on
goloshes
in
*NL*
such
cold
weather
,
he
looked
at
them
contemptuously
as
he
crossed
the
hall
*NL*
and
went
out
with
only
his
boots
on
.
Perezvon
,
seeing
him
in
his
outdoor
*NL*
clothes
,
began
tapping
nervously
,
yet
vigorously
,
on
the
floor
with
his
*NL*
tail
.
Twitching
all
over
,
he
even
uttered
a
plaintive
whine
.
But
Kolya
,
*NL*
seeing
his
dog
's
passionate
excitement
,
decided
that
it
was
a
breach
of
*NL*
discipline
,
kept
him
for
another
minute
under
the
bench
,
and
only
when
he
*NL*
had
opened
the
door
into
the
passage
,
whistled
for
him
.
The
dog
leapt
up
*NL*
like
a
mad
creature
and
rushed
bounding
before
him
rapturously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
opened
the
door
to
peep
at
``
the
kids
.
''
They
were
both
sitting
as
*NL*
before
at
the
table
,
not
reading
but
warmly
disputing
about
something
.
The
*NL*
children
often
argued
together
about
various
exciting
problems
of
life
,
*NL*
and
Nastya
,
being
the
elder
,
always
got
the
best
of
it
.
If
Kostya
did
not
*NL*
agree
with
her
,
he
almost
always
appealed
to
Kolya
Krassotkin
,
and
his
*NL*
verdict
was
regarded
as
infallible
by
both
of
them
.
This
time
the
``
kids
'
''
*NL*
discussion
rather
interested
Krassotkin
,
and
he
stood
still
in
the
passage
*NL*
to
listen
.
The
children
saw
he
was
listening
and
that
made
them
dispute
*NL*
with
even
greater
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
,
never
believe
,
''
Nastya
prattled
,
``
that
the
old
women
find
*NL*
babies
among
the
cabbages
in
the
kitchen-garden
.
It
's
winter
now
and
there
*NL*
are
no
cabbages
,
and
so
the
old
woman
could
n't
have
taken
Katerina
a
*NL*
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
whistled
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
perhaps
they
do
bring
babies
from
somewhere
,
but
only
to
those
who
are
*NL*
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kostya
stared
at
Nastya
and
listened
,
pondering
profoundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastya
,
how
silly
you
are
!
''
he
said
at
last
,
firmly
and
calmly
.
``
How
can
*NL*
Katerina
have
a
baby
when
she
is
n't
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastya
was
exasperated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
nothing
about
it
,
''
she
snapped
irritably
.
``
Perhaps
she
has
a
*NL*
husband
,
only
he
is
in
prison
,
so
now
she
's
got
a
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
her
husband
in
prison
?
''
the
matter-of-fact
Kostya
inquired
*NL*
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
,
I
tell
you
what
,
''
Nastya
interrupted
impulsively
,
completely
*NL*
rejecting
and
forgetting
her
first
hypothesis
.
``
She
has
n't
a
husband
,
you
*NL*
are
right
there
,
but
she
wants
to
be
married
,
and
so
she
's
been
thinking
*NL*
of
getting
married
,
and
thinking
and
thinking
of
it
till
now
she
's
got
it
,
*NL*
that
is
,
not
a
husband
but
a
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
so
,
''
Kostya
agreed
,
entirely
vanquished
.
``
But
you
did
n't
*NL*
say
so
before
.
So
how
could
I
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
kiddies
,
''
said
Kolya
,
stepping
into
the
room
.
``
You
're
terrible
*NL*
people
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Perezvon
with
you
!
''
grinned
Kostya
,
and
began
snapping
his
fingers
*NL*
and
calling
Perezvon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
a
difficulty
,
kids
,
''
Krassotkin
began
solemnly
,
``
and
you
must
*NL*
help
me
.
Agafya
must
have
broken
her
leg
,
since
she
has
not
turned
up
till
*NL*
now
,
that
's
certain
.
I
must
go
out
.
Will
you
let
me
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
looked
anxiously
at
one
another
.
Their
smiling
faces
showed
*NL*
signs
of
uneasiness
,
but
they
did
not
yet
fully
grasp
what
was
expected
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
naughty
while
I
am
gone
?
You
wo
n't
climb
on
the
cupboard
and
*NL*
break
your
legs
?
You
wo
n't
be
frightened
alone
and
cry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
look
of
profound
despondency
came
into
the
children
's
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
could
show
you
something
as
a
reward
,
a
little
copper
cannon
which
*NL*
can
be
fired
with
real
gunpowder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
's
faces
instantly
brightened
.
``
Show
us
the
cannon
,
''
said
*NL*
Kostya
,
beaming
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Krassotkin
put
his
hand
in
his
satchel
,
and
pulling
out
a
little
bronze
*NL*
cannon
stood
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
bound
to
ask
that
!
Look
,
it
's
on
wheels
.
''
He
rolled
the
toy
*NL*
on
along
the
table
.
``
And
it
can
be
fired
off
,
too
.
It
can
be
loaded
with
*NL*
shot
and
fired
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
could
kill
any
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
kill
any
one
;
you
've
only
got
to
aim
at
anybody
,
''
and
Krassotkin
*NL*
explained
where
the
powder
had
to
be
put
,
where
the
shot
should
be
rolled
*NL*
in
,
showing
a
tiny
hole
like
a
touch-hole
,
and
told
them
that
it
kicked
*NL*
when
it
was
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
listened
with
intense
interest
.
What
particularly
struck
*NL*
their
imagination
was
that
the
cannon
kicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
got
any
powder
?
''
Nastya
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
us
the
powder
,
too
,
''
she
drawled
with
a
smile
of
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Krassotkin
dived
again
into
his
satchel
and
pulled
out
a
small
flask
*NL*
containing
a
little
real
gunpowder
.
He
had
some
shot
,
too
,
in
a
screw
of
*NL*
paper
.
He
even
uncorked
the
flask
and
shook
a
little
powder
into
the
palm
*NL*
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
has
to
be
careful
there
's
no
fire
about
,
or
it
would
blow
up
and
kill
*NL*
us
all
,
''
Krassotkin
warned
them
sensationally
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
gazed
at
the
powder
with
an
awe-stricken
alarm
that
only
*NL*
intensified
their
enjoyment
.
But
Kostya
liked
the
shot
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
the
shot
burn
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
a
little
shot
,
''
he
asked
in
an
imploring
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
you
a
little
shot
;
here
,
take
it
,
but
do
n't
show
it
to
your
*NL*
mother
till
I
come
back
,
or
she
'll
be
sure
to
think
it
's
gunpowder
,
and
*NL*
will
die
of
fright
and
give
you
a
thrashing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
never
does
whip
us
,
''
Nastya
observed
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
only
said
it
to
finish
the
sentence
.
And
do
n't
you
ever
deceive
*NL*
your
mother
except
just
this
once
,
until
I
come
back
.
And
so

kiddies
,
can
*NL*
I
go
out
?
You
wo
n't
be
frightened
and
cry
when
I
'm
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
sha
--
all
cry
,
''
drawled
Kostya
,
on
the
verge
of
tears
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
cry
,
we
shall
be
sure
to
cry
,
''
Nastya
chimed
in
with
timid
*NL*
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
children
,
children
,
how
fraught
with
peril
are
your
years
!
There
's
no

shall
have
to
stay

is
passing

oogh
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
Perezvon
to
pretend
to
be
dead
!
''
Kostya
begged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
help
for
it
,
we
must
have
recourse
to
Perezvon
.
_
Ici
_
,
*NL*
Perezvon
.
''
And
Kolya
began
giving
orders
to
the
dog
,
who
performed
all
his
*NL*
tricks
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
rough-haired
dog
,
of
medium
size
,
with
a
coat
of
a
sort
of
lilac
-
*NL*
gray
color
.
He
was
blind
in
his
right
eye
,
and
his
left
ear
was
torn
.
He
*NL*
whined
and
jumped
,
stood
and
walked
on
his
hind
legs
,
lay
on
his
back
with
*NL*
his
paws
in
the
air
,
rigid
as
though
he
were
dead
.
While
this
last
*NL*
performance
was
going
on
,
the
door
opened
and
Agafya
,
Madame
Krassotkin
's
*NL*
servant
,
a
stout
woman
of
forty
,
marked
with
small-pox
,
appeared
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
She
had
come
back
from
market
and
had
a
bag
full
of
provisions
in
*NL*
her
hand
.
Holding
up
the
bag
of
provisions
in
her
left
hand
she
stood
*NL*
still
to
watch
the
dog
.
Though
Kolya
had
been
so
anxious
for
her
return
,
*NL*
he
did
not
cut
short
the
performance
,
and
after
keeping
Perezvon
dead
for
*NL*
the
usual
time
,
at
last
he
whistled
to
him
.
The
dog
jumped
up
and
began
*NL*
bounding
about
in
his
joy
at
having
done
his
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
think
,
a
dog
!
''
Agafya
observed
sententiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
late
,
female
?
''
asked
Krassotkin
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Female
,
indeed
!
Go
on
with
you
,
you
brat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
brat

busying
herself
about

without

Chapter

The
Schoolboy
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kolya
did
not
hear
her
.
At
last
he
could
go
out
.
As
he
went
out
at
the
*NL*
gate
he
looked
round
him
,
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
,
and
saying
``
It
is
*NL*
freezing
,
''
went
straight
along
the
street
and
turned
off
to
the
right
*NL*
towards
the
market-place
.
When
he
reached
the
last
house
but
one
before
*NL*
the
market-place
he
stopped
at
the
gate
,
pulled
a
whistle
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
whistled
with
all
his
might
as
though
giving
a
signal
.
He
had
*NL*
not
to
wait
more
than
a
minute
before
a
rosy-cheeked
boy
of
about
eleven
,
*NL*
wearing
a
warm
,
neat
and
even
stylish
coat
,
darted
out
to
meet
him
.
This
*NL*
was
Smurov
,
a
boy
in
the
preparatory
class
-LRB-
two
classes
below
Kolya
*NL*
Krassotkin
-RRB-
,
son
of
a
well-to-do
official
.
Apparently
he
was
forbidden
by
*NL*
his
parents
to
associate
with
Krassotkin
,
who
was
well
known
to
be
a
*NL*
desperately
naughty
boy
,
so
Smurov
was
obviously
slipping
out
on
the
sly
.
*NL*
He
was
--
if
the
reader
has
not
forgotten
--
one
of
the
group
of
boys
who
two
*NL*
months
before
had
thrown
stones
at
Ilusha
.
He
was
the
one
who
told
Alyosha
*NL*
Karamazov
about
Ilusha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
for
the
last
hour
,
Krassotkin
,
''
said
Smurov
*NL*
stolidly
,
and
the
boys
strode
towards
the
market-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
late
,
''
answered
Krassotkin
.
``
I
was
detained
by
circumstances
.
You
*NL*
wo
n't
be
thrashed
for
coming
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

I

*NL*

Yes

*NL*
``
Ah

do

Smurov
suddenly
stood
still

``
You

says
that

was

shaggy

grayish

smoky-looking

Could

he
might
believe

*NL*
``

Smurov
,
with
a
sigh
.
``
You

was
going

bring
him

real
mastiff

with
a

nose

to-day

He
thinks
that

comfort
Ilusha

I
*NL*
doubt
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
Ilusha

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

I

in

he

quite

conscious
,
but
his
breathing
!
His
breathing
's
gone
wrong
.
The
other
day
he
*NL*
asked
to
have
his
boots
on
to
be
led
round
the
room
.
He
tried
to
walk

but
*NL*
he
could

`
Ah

he
said

He
fancied
it

was
his
boots

made
him
stagger
,
but
it
was
simply
weakness
,
really
.
*NL*
He
wo

themselves

Of

they
went
with
Karamazov
at
first

And
*NL*
there
's
been
nothing

no
silliness

First
one
went

then

another

he

glad

up

asked

He
just
asks
and
says
no

will
go
out

*NL*
Kolya
subsided
into
dignified
silence
.
Smurov
,
too
,
was
silent

Smurov
,
of
*NL*
course
,
worshiped
Krassotkin
and
never
dreamed
of
putting
himself
on
a
*NL*
level
with
him
.
Now
he
was
tremendously
interested
at
Kolya
's
saying
that
*NL*
he
was
``
going
of
himself
''
to
see
Ilusha
.
He
felt
that
there
must
be
some
*NL*
mystery
in
Kolya
's
suddenly
taking
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
him
that
day

*NL*
They
crossed
the
market-place
,
in
which
at
that
hour
were
many
loaded
*NL*
wagons
from
the
country
and
a
great
number
of
live
fowls
.
The
market
women
*NL*
were
selling
rolls
,
cottons
and
threads
,
etc.
,
in
their
booths
.
These
*NL*
Sunday
markets
were
naively
called
``
fairs
''
in
the
town
,
and
there
were
*NL*
many
such
fairs
in
the
year

*NL*
*NL*
Perezvon
ran
about
in
the
wildest
spirits
,
sniffing
about
first
one
side
,
*NL*
then
the
other
.
When
he
met
other
dogs
they
zealously
smelt
each
other
*NL*
over
according
to
the
rules
of
canine
etiquette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

There
was
a
roar
of
laughter
among

round
her
.
*NL*
Suddenly
a
man
in
a
violent
rage
darted
out
from
the
arcade
of
shops
close
*NL*
by
.
He
was
a
young
man
,
not
a
native
of
the
town
,
with
dark
,
curly
hair
*NL*
and
a
long
,
pale
face
,
marked
with
smallpox
.
He
wore
a
long
blue
coat
and
*NL*
a
peaked
cap
,
and
looked
like
a
merchant
's
clerk
.
He
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
stupid
excitement
and
brandished
his
fist
at
Kolya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

he
cried
angrily
,
``
I

*NL*
Kolya
stared
at
him

He
could
not
recall
when
he
could
have
had
a
row
with

the
man

But
he
had
been
in
so
many
rows
in
the
street
that
he
could
*NL*
hardly
remember
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

he
asked
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

repeated
idiotically

So

Well

asked
the

loutish
amazement

at

still
as
angry

Kolya
scanned

gravely

*NL*
``
Have

somewhat
taken
aback

No

Well

said
Kolya
,
cutting
short
the
*NL*
conversation
;
and
turning
sharply
to
the
right
he
strode
quickly
on
his
*NL*
way
as
though
he
disdained
further
conversation
with
a
dolt
who
did
not
*NL*
even
know
Sabaneyev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop

What
Sabaneyev

the
young
man
recovered
from
his
momentary
*NL*
stupefaction
and
was
as
excited
as
before
.
``
What
did
he
say

He
turned
to
*NL*
the
market
women
with
a
silly
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

never

``

the

repeated

still

furious
and
brandishing
his
right
arm
.

*NL*
``

one

stared
at

wildly

repeated
another

off

In

struck

considerable

from

stopped

ahead

cut

short

in

The

*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
leaned
against
the
fence
with
an
air
of
dignity
,
waiting
for
Alyosha
*NL*
to
appear
.
Yes
,
he
had
long
wanted
to
meet
him
.
He
had
heard
a
great
deal
*NL*
about
him
from
the
boys
,
but
hitherto
he
had
always
maintained
an
*NL*
appearance
of
disdainful
indifference
when
he
was
mentioned
,
and
he
had
*NL*
even
``
criticized
''
what
he
heard
about
Alyosha
.
But
secretly
he
had
a
great
*NL*
longing
to
make
his
acquaintance
;
there
was
something
sympathetic
and
*NL*
attractive
in
all
he
was
told
about
Alyosha
.
So
the
present
moment
was
*NL*
important
:
to
begin
with
,
he
had
to
show
himself
at
his
best
,
to
show
his
*NL*
independence
,
``
Or
he
'll
think
of
me
as
thirteen
and
take
me
for
a
boy
,
*NL*
like
the
rest
of
them
.
And
what
are
these
boys
to
him
?
I
shall
ask
him
*NL*
when
I
get
to
know
him
.
It
's
a
pity
I
am
so
short
,
though

Tuzikov
is
*NL*
younger
than
I
am

he
is
half

taller

I
have

fall
into

all
at

,
he
may
*NL*
think
--
Tfoo
!
how
horrible
if
he
should
think
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
thoughts
that
excited
Kolya
while
he
was
doing
his
utmost
to
*NL*
assume
the
most
independent
air
.
What
distressed
him
most
was
his
being
so
*NL*
short
;
he
did
not
mind
so
much
his
``
hideous
''
face
,
as
being
so
short
.
On
*NL*
the
wall
in
a
corner
at
home
he
had
the
year
before
made
a
pencil-mark
to
*NL*
show
his
height
,
and
every
two
months
since
he
anxiously
measured
himself
*NL*
against
it
to
see
how
much
he
had
gained
.
But
alas
!
he
grew
very
slowly
,
*NL*
and
this
sometimes
reduced
him
almost
to
despair
.
His
face
was
in
reality
*NL*
by
no
means
``
hideous
''
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
rather
attractive
,
with
a
*NL*
fair
,
pale
skin
,
freckled
.
His
small
,
lively
gray
eyes
had
a
fearless
*NL*
look
,
and
often
glowed
with
feeling
.
He
had
rather
high
cheekbones
;
small
,
*NL*
very
red
,
but
not
very
thick
,
lips
;
his
nose
was
small
and
unmistakably
*NL*
turned
up
.
``
I
've
a
regular
pug
nose
,
a
regular
pug
nose
,
''
Kolya
used
to
*NL*
mutter
to
himself
when
he
looked
in
the
looking-glass
,
and
he
always
left
*NL*
it
with
indignation
.
``
But
perhaps
I
have
n't
got
a
clever
face
?
''
he
*NL*
sometimes
thought
,
doubtful
even
of
that
.
But
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
*NL*
his
mind
was
preoccupied
with
his
face
and
his
height
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
however
bitter
the
moments
before
the
looking-glass
were
to
him
,
he
*NL*
quickly
forgot
them
,
and
forgot
them
for
a
long
time
,
``
abandoning
himself
*NL*
entirely
to
ideas
and
to
real
life
,
''
as
he
formulated
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
came
out
quickly
and
hastened
up
to
Kolya
.
Before
he
reached
him
,
*NL*
Kolya
could
see
that
he
looked
delighted
.
``
Can
he
be
so
glad
to
see
me
?
''
*NL*
Kolya
wondered
,
feeling
pleased
.
We
may
note
here
,
in
passing
,
that
*NL*
Alyosha
's
appearance
had
undergone
a
complete
change
since
we
saw
him
*NL*
last
.
He
had
abandoned
his
cassock
and
was
wearing
now
a
well-cut
coat
,
a
*NL*
soft
,
round
hat
,
and
his
hair
had
been
cropped
short
.
All
this
was
very
*NL*
becoming
to
him
,
and
he
looked
quite
handsome
.
His
charming
face
always
*NL*
had
a
good-humored
expression
;
but
there
was
a
gentleness
and
serenity
in
*NL*
his
good-humor
.
To
Kolya
's
surprise
,
Alyosha
came
out
to
him
just
as
he
*NL*
was
,
without
an
overcoat
.
He
had
evidently
come
in
haste
.
He
held
out
his
*NL*
hand
to
Kolya
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
at
last
!
How
anxious
we
've
been
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
reasons
which
you
shall
know
directly
.
Anyway
,
I
am
glad
to
*NL*
make
your
acquaintance
.
I
've
long
been
hoping
for
an
opportunity
,
and
have
*NL*
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
,
''
Kolya
muttered
,
a
little
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
have
met
anyway
.
I
've
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
,
too
;
but
*NL*
you
've
been
a
long
time
coming
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
how
are
things
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
is
very
ill
.
He
is
certainly
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
awful
!
You
must
admit
that
medicine
is
a
fraud
,
Karamazov
,
''
cried
*NL*
Kolya
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
has
mentioned
you
often
,
very
often
,
even
in
his
sleep
,
in
*NL*
delirium
,
you
know
.
One
can
see
that
you
used
to
be
very
,
very
dear
to
him
*NL*
...
before
the
incident
...
with
the
knife
...
Then
there
's
another
*NL*
reason
...
Tell
me
,
is
that
your
dog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Perezvon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Zhutchka
?
''
Alyosha
looked
at
Kolya
with
eyes
full
of
pity
.
``
Is
she
*NL*
lost
for
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
would
all
like
it
to
be
Zhutchka
.
I
've
heard
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
Kolya
smiled
mysteriously
.
``
Listen
,
Karamazov
,
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
.
*NL*
That
's
what
I
came
for
;
that
's
what
I
asked
you
to
come
out
here
for
,
to
*NL*
explain
the
whole
episode
to
you
before
we
go
in
,
''
he
began
with
*NL*
animation
.
``
You
see
,
Karamazov
,
Ilusha
came
into
the
preparatory
class
*NL*
last
spring
.
Well
,
you
know
what
our
preparatory
class
is
--
a
lot
of
small
*NL*
boys
.
They
began
teasing
Ilusha
at
once
.
I
am
two
classes
higher
up
,
and
,
*NL*
of
course
,
I
only
look
on
at
them
from
a
distance
.
I
saw
the
boy
was
weak
*NL*
and
small
,
but
he
would
n't
give
in
to
them
;
he
fought
with
them
.
I
saw
he
*NL*
was
proud
,
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
fire
.
I
like
children
like
that
.
And
*NL*
they
teased
him
all
the
more
.
The
worst
of
it
was
he
was
horribly
dressed
*NL*
at
the
time
,
his
breeches
were
too
small
for
him
,
and
there
were
holes
in
*NL*
his
boots
.
They
worried
him
about
it
;
they
jeered
at
him
.
That
I
ca
n't
*NL*
stand
.
I
stood
up
for
him
at
once
,
and
gave
it
to
them
hot
.
I
beat
them
,
*NL*
but
they
adore
me
,
do
you
know
,
Karamazov
?
''
Kolya
boasted
impulsively
;
*NL*
``
but
I
am
always
fond
of
children
.
I
've
two
chickens
in
my
hands
at
home
*NL*
now
--
that
's
what
detained
me
to-day
.
So
they
left
off
beating
Ilusha
and
I
*NL*
took
him
under
my
protection
.
I
saw
the
boy
was
proud
.
I
tell
you
that
,
*NL*
the
boy
was
proud
;
but
in
the
end
he
became
slavishly
devoted
to
me
:
he
*NL*
did
my
slightest
bidding
,
obeyed
me
as
though
I
were
God
,
tried
to
copy
*NL*
me
.
In
the
intervals
between
the
classes
he
used
to
run
to
me
at
once
,
and
*NL*
I
'd
go
about
with
him
.
On
Sundays
,
too
.
They
always
laugh
when
an
older
*NL*
boy
makes
friends
with
a
younger
one
like
that
;
but
that
's
a
prejudice
.
If
*NL*
it
's
my
fancy
,
that
's
enough
.
I
am
teaching
him
,
developing
him
.
Why
*NL*
should
n't
I
develop
him
if
I
like
him
?
Here
you
,
Karamazov
,
have
taken
up
*NL*
with
all
these
nestlings
.
I
see
you
want
to
influence
the
younger
*NL*
generation
--
to
develop
them
,
to
be
of
use
to
them
,
and
I
assure
you
this
*NL*
trait
in
your
character
,
which
I
knew
by
hearsay
,
attracted
me
more
than
*NL*
anything
.
Let
us
get
to
the
point
,
though
.
I
noticed
that
there
was
a
sort
*NL*
of
softness
and
sentimentality
coming
over
the
boy
,
and
you
know
I
have
a
*NL*
positive
hatred
of
this
sheepish
sentimentality
,
and
I
have
had
it
from
a
*NL*
baby
.
There
were
contradictions
in
him
,
too
:
he
was
proud
,
but
he
was
*NL*
slavishly
devoted
to
me
,
and
yet
all
at
once
his
eyes
would
flash
and
he
'd
*NL*
refuse
to
agree
with
me
;
he
'd
argue
,
fly
into
a
rage
.
I
used
sometimes
to
*NL*
propound
certain
ideas
;
I
could
see
that
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
*NL*
disagreed
with
the
ideas
,
but
that
he
was
simply
rebelling
against
me
,
*NL*
because
I
was
cool
in
responding
to
his
endearments
.
And
so
,
in
order
to
*NL*
train
him
properly
,
the
tenderer
he
was
,
the
colder
I
became
.
I
did
it
on
*NL*
purpose
:
that
was
my
idea
.
My
object
was
to
form
his
character
,
to
lick
*NL*
him
into
shape
,
to
make
a
man
of
him
...
and
besides
...
no
doubt
,
you
*NL*
understand
me
at
a
word
.
Suddenly
I
noticed
for
three
days
in
succession
*NL*
he
was
downcast
and
dejected
,
not
because
of
my
coldness
,
but
for
*NL*
something
else
,
something
more
important
.
I
wondered
what
the
tragedy
was
.
*NL*
I
have
pumped
him
and
found
out
that
he
had
somehow
got
to
know
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
who
was
footman
to
your
late
father
--
it
was
before
his
death
,
*NL*
of
course
--
and
he
taught
the
little
fool
a
silly
trick
--
that
is
,
a
brutal
,
*NL*
nasty
trick
.
He
told
him
to
take
a
piece
of
bread
,
to
stick
a
pin
in
it
,
*NL*
and
throw
it
to
one
of
those
hungry
dogs
who
snap
up
anything
without
*NL*
biting
it
,
and
then
to
watch
and
see
what
would
happen
.
So
they
prepared
a
*NL*
piece
of
bread
like
that
and
threw
it
to
Zhutchka
,
that
shaggy
dog
there
's
*NL*
been
such
a
fuss
about
.
The
people
of
the
house
it
belonged
to
never
fed
*NL*
it
at
all
,
though
it
barked
all
day
.
-LRB-
Do
you
like
that
stupid
barking
,
*NL*
Karamazov
?
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
-RRB-
So
it
rushed
at
the
bread
,
swallowed
it
,
and
*NL*
began
to
squeal
;
it
turned
round
and
round
and
ran
away
,
squealing
as
it
*NL*
ran
out
of
sight
.
That
was
Ilusha
's
own
account
of
it
.
He
confessed
it
to
*NL*
me
,
and
cried
bitterly
.
He
hugged
me
,
shaking
all
over
.
He
kept
on
*NL*
repeating
`
He
ran
away
squealing
'
:
the
sight
of
that
haunted
him
.
He
was
*NL*
tormented
by
remorse
,
I
could
see
that
.
I
took
it
seriously
.
I
determined
*NL*
to
give
him
a
lesson
for
other
things
as
well
.
So
I
must
confess
I
was
n't
*NL*
quite
straightforward
,
and
pretended
to
be
more
indignant
perhaps
than
I
*NL*
was
.
`
You
've
done
a
nasty
thing
,
'
I
said
,
`
you
are
a
scoundrel
.
I
wo
n't
*NL*
tell
of
it
,
of
course
,
but
I
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
for
a
*NL*
time
.
I
'll
think
it
over
and
let
you
know
through
Smurov
'
--
that
's
the
boy
*NL*
who
's
just
come
with
me
;
he
's
always
ready
to
do
anything
for
me
--
`
whether
*NL*
I
will
have
anything
to
do
with
you
in
the
future
or
whether
I
give
you
up
*NL*
for
good
as
a
scoundrel
.
'
He
was
tremendously
upset
.
I
must
own
I
felt
I
'd
*NL*
gone
too
far
as
I
spoke
,
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
.
I
did
what
I
*NL*
thought
best
at
the
time
.
A
day
or
two
after
,
I
sent
Smurov
to
tell
him
*NL*
that
I
would
not
speak
to
him
again
.
That
's
what
we
call
it
when
two
*NL*
schoolfellows
refuse
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
one
another
.
*NL*
Secretly
I
only
meant
to
send
him
to
Coventry
for
a
few
days
and
then
,
if
*NL*
I
saw
signs
of
repentance
,
to
hold
out
my
hand
to
him
again
.
That
was
my
*NL*
intention
.
But
what
do
you
think
happened
?
He
heard
Smurov
's
message
,
his
*NL*
eyes
flashed
.
`
Tell
Krassotkin
from
me
,
'
he
cried
,
`
that
I
will
throw
*NL*
bread
with
pins
to
all
the
dogs
--
all
--
all
of
them
!
'
`
So
he
's
going
in
for
a
*NL*
little
temper
.
We
must
smoke
it
out
of
him
.
'
And
I
began
to
treat
him
with
*NL*
contempt
;
whenever
I
met
him
I
turned
away
or
smiled
sarcastically
.
And
*NL*
just
then
that
affair
with
his
father
happened
.
You
remember
?
You
must
*NL*
realize
that
he
was
fearfully
worked
up
by
what
had
happened
already
.
The
*NL*
boys
,
seeing
I
'd
given
him
up
,
set
on
him
and
taunted
him
,
shouting
,
`
Wisp
*NL*
of
tow
,
wisp
of
tow
!
'
And
he
had
soon
regular
skirmishes
with
them
,
which
*NL*
I
am
very
sorry
for
.
They
seem
to
have
given
him
one
very
bad
beating
.
One
*NL*
day
he
flew
at
them
all
as
they
were
coming
out
of
school
.
I
stood
a
few
*NL*
yards
off
,
looking
on
.
And
,
I
swear
,
I
do
n't
remember
that
I
laughed
;
it
*NL*
was
quite
the
other
way
,
I
felt
awfully
sorry
for
him
,
in
another
minute
I
*NL*
would
have
run
up
to
take
his
part
.
But
he
suddenly
met
my
eyes
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
he
fancied
;
but
he
pulled
out
a
penknife
,
rushed
at
me
,
and
*NL*
struck
at
my
thigh
,
here
in
my
right
leg
.
I
did
n't
move
.
I
do
n't
mind
*NL*
owning
I
am
plucky
sometimes
,
Karamazov
.
I
simply
looked
at
him
*NL*
contemptuously
,
as
though
to
say
,
`
This
is
how
you
repay
all
my
kindness
!
*NL*
Do
it
again
,
if
you
like
,
I
'm
at
your
service
.
'
But
he
did
n't
stab
me
*NL*
again
;
he
broke
down
,
he
was
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
,
he
threw
away
*NL*
the
knife
,
burst
out
crying
,
and
ran
away
.
I
did
not
sneak
on
him
,
of
*NL*
course
,
and
I
made
them
all
keep
quiet
,
so
it
should
n't
come
to
the
ears
*NL*
of
the
masters
.
I
did
n't
even
tell
my
mother
till
it
had
healed
up
.
And
*NL*
the
wound
was
a
mere
scratch
.
And
then
I
heard
that
the
same
day
he
'd
been
*NL*
throwing
stones
and
had
bitten
your
finger
--
but
you
understand
now
what
a
*NL*
state
he
was
in
!
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
:
it
was
stupid
of
me
not
to
come
*NL*
and
forgive
him
--
that
is
,
to
make
it
up
with
him
--
when
he
was
taken
ill
.
I
*NL*
am
sorry
for
it
now
.
But
I
had
a
special
reason
.
So
now
I
've
told
you
all
*NL*
about
it
...
but
I
'm
afraid
it
was
stupid
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
pity
,
''
exclaimed
Alyosha
,
with
feeling
,
``
that
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
before
what
terms
you
were
on
with
him
,
or
I
'd
have
come
to
you
long
ago
*NL*
to
beg
you
to
go
to
him
with
me
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
when
he
was
*NL*
feverish
he
talked
about
you
in
delirium
.
I
did
n't
know
how
much
you
were
*NL*
to
him
!
And
you
've
really
not
succeeded
in
finding
that
dog
?
His
father
*NL*
and
the
boys
have
been
hunting
all
over
the
town
for
it
.
Would
you
believe
*NL*
it
,
since
he
's
been
ill
,
I
've
three
times
heard
him
repeat
with
tears
,
*NL*
`
It
's
because
I
killed
Zhutchka
,
father
,
that
I
am
ill
now
.
God
is
*NL*
punishing
me
for
it
.
'
He
ca
n't
get
that
idea
out
of
his
head
.
And
if
the
*NL*
dog
were
found
and
proved
to
be
alive
,
one
might
almost
fancy
the
joy
*NL*
would
cure
him
.
We
have
all
rested
our
hopes
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
what
made
you
hope
that
I
should
be
the
one
to
find
him
?
''
Kolya
*NL*
asked
,
with
great
curiosity
.
``
Why
did
you
reckon
on
me
rather
than
any
one
*NL*
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
report
that
you
were
looking
for
the
dog
,
and
that
you
would
*NL*
bring
it
when
you
'd
found
it
.
Smurov
said
something
of
the
sort
.
We
've
all
*NL*
been
trying
to
persuade
Ilusha
that
the
dog
is
alive
,
that
it
's
been
seen
.
*NL*
The
boys
brought
him
a
live
hare
;
he
just
looked
at
it
,
with
a
faint
*NL*
smile
,
and
asked
them
to
set
it
free
in
the
fields
.
And
so
we
did
.
His
*NL*
father
has
just
this
moment
come
back
,
bringing
him
a
mastiff
pup
,
hoping
*NL*
to
comfort
him
with
that
;
but
I
think
it
only
makes
it
worse
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Karamazov
,
what
sort
of
man
is
the
father

I
know
him

but
what
*NL*
do
you
make
of
him
--
a
mountebank

a
buffoon
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no

there
are
people
of
deep

have
been

a

Believe
me
,
Krassotkin
,
that
sort
of
buffoonery
is
*NL*
sometimes
tragic
in
the
extreme

His
whole
life
now
is
centered
in
Ilusha

if
Ilusha
dies

he
will
either
go

I
was

you

Grown-up

and
is
n't

that
just
the

different

And

sometimes

much

difference

Chapter
V.
By
Ilusha
's
Bedside
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
inhabited
by
the
family
of
the
retired
captain
Snegiryov
is
*NL*
already
familiar
to
the
reader
.
It
was
close
and
crowded
at
that
moment
*NL*
with
a
number
of
visitors
.
Several
boys
were
sitting
with
Ilusha
,
and
*NL*
though
all
of
them
,
like
Smurov
,
were
prepared
to
deny
that
it
was
Alyosha
*NL*
who
had
brought
them
and
reconciled
them
with
Ilusha
,
it
was
really
the
*NL*
fact
.
All
the
art
he
had
used
had
been
to
take
them
,
one
by
one
,
to
*NL*
Ilusha
,
without
``
sheepish
sentimentality
,
''
appearing
to
do
so
casually
and
*NL*
without
design
.
It
was
a
great
consolation
to
Ilusha
in
his
suffering
.
He
*NL*
was
greatly
touched
by
seeing
the
almost
tender
affection
and
sympathy
*NL*
shown
him
by
these
boys
,
who
had
been
his
enemies
.
Krassotkin
was
the
only
*NL*
one
missing
and
his
absence
was
a
heavy
load
on
Ilusha
's
heart
.
Perhaps
*NL*
the
bitterest
of
all
his
bitter
memories
was
his
stabbing
Krassotkin
,
who
*NL*
had
been
his
one
friend
and
protector
.
Clever
little
Smurov
,
who
was
the
*NL*
first
to
make
it
up
with
Ilusha
,
thought
it
was
so
.
But
when
Smurov
hinted
*NL*
to
Krassotkin
that
Alyosha
wanted
to
come
and
see
him
about
something
,
the
*NL*
latter
cut
him
short
,
bidding
Smurov
tell
``
Karamazov
''
at
once
that
he
knew
*NL*
best
what
to
do
,
that
he
wanted
no
one
's
advice
,
and
that
,
if
he
went
to
*NL*
see
Ilusha
,
he
would
choose
his
own
time
for
he
had
``
his
own
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
fortnight
before
this
Sunday
.
That
was
why
Alyosha
had
not
been
*NL*
to
see
him
,
as
he
had
meant
to
.
But
though
he
waited
,
he
sent
Smurov
to
*NL*
him
twice
again
.
Both
times
Krassotkin
met
him
with
a
curt
,
impatient
*NL*
refusal
,
sending
Alyosha
a
message
not
to
bother
him
any
more
,
that
if
he
*NL*
came
himself
,
he
,
Krassotkin
,
would
not
go
to
Ilusha
at
all
.
Up
to
the
*NL*
very
last
day
,
Smurov
did
not
know
that
Kolya
meant
to
go
to
Ilusha
that
*NL*
morning
,
and
only
the
evening
before
,
as
he
parted
from
Smurov
,
Kolya
*NL*
abruptly
told
him
to
wait
at
home
for
him
next
morning
,
for
he
would
go
*NL*
with
him
to
the
Snegiryovs
'
,
but
warned
him
on
no
account
to
say
he
was
*NL*
coming
,
as
he
wanted
to
drop
in
casually
.
Smurov
obeyed
.
Smurov
's
fancy
*NL*
that
Kolya
would
bring
back
the
lost
dog
was
based
on
the
words
Kolya
had
*NL*
dropped
that
``
they
must
be
asses
not
to
find
the
dog
,
if
it
was
alive
.
''
*NL*
When
Smurov
,
waiting
for
an
opportunity
,
timidly
hinted
at
his
guess
about
*NL*
the
dog
,
Krassotkin
flew
into
a
violent
rage
.
``
I
'm
not
such
an
ass
as
to
*NL*
go
hunting
about
the
town
for
other
people
's
dogs
when
I
've
got
a
dog
of
*NL*
my
own
!
And
how
can
you
imagine
a
dog
could
be
alive
after
swallowing
a
*NL*
pin
?
Sheepish
sentimentality
,
that
's
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
fortnight
Ilusha
had
not
left
his
little
bed
under
the
ikons
*NL*
in
the
corner
.
He
had
not
been
to
school
since
the
day
he
met
Alyosha
and
*NL*
bit
his
finger
.
He
was
taken
ill
the
same
day
,
though
for
a
month
*NL*
afterwards
he
was
sometimes
able
to
get
up
and
walk
about
the
room
and
*NL*
passage
.
But
latterly
he
had
become
so
weak
that
he
could
not
move
without
*NL*
help
from
his
father
.
His
father
was
terribly
concerned
about
him
.
He
even
*NL*
gave
up
drinking
and
was
almost
crazy
with
terror
that
his
boy
would
die
.
*NL*
And
often
,
especially
after
leading
him
round
the
room
on
his
arm
and
*NL*
putting
him
back
to
bed
,
he
would
run
to
a
dark
corner
in
the
passage
and
,
*NL*
leaning
his
head
against
the
wall
,
he
would
break
into
paroxysms
of
*NL*
violent
weeping
,
stifling
his
sobs
that
they
might
not
be
heard
by
Ilusha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
to
the
room
,
he
would
usually
begin
doing
something
to
amuse
and
*NL*
comfort
his
precious
boy
;
he
would
tell
him
stories
,
funny
anecdotes
,
or
*NL*
would
mimic
comic
people
he
had
happened
to
meet
,
even
imitate
the
howls
*NL*
and
cries
of
animals
.
But
Ilusha
could
not
bear
to
see
his
father
fooling
*NL*
and
playing
the
buffoon
.
Though
the
boy
tried
not
to
show
how
he
disliked
*NL*
it
,
he
saw
with
an
aching
heart
that
his
father
was
an
object
of
contempt
,
*NL*
and
he
was
continually
haunted
by
the
memory
of
the
``
wisp
of
tow
''
and
that
*NL*
``
terrible
day
.

*NL*

buffoonery

Varvara
had
been
gone
for
some
time
past
to
Petersburg
*NL*
to
study

But
the
half-imbecile
mother
was
greatly
*NL*
diverted
and
laughed
heartily
when
her
husband
began
capering
about
or
*NL*
performing
something
.
It
was
the
only
way
she
could
be
amused
;
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
time
she
was
grumbling
and
complaining
that
now
every
one
had
*NL*
forgotten
her
,
that
no
one
treated
her
with
respect
,
that
she
was
*NL*
slighted
,
and
so
on
.
But
during
the
last
few
days
she
had
completely
*NL*
changed
.
She
began
looking
constantly
at
Ilusha
's
bed
in
the
corner
and
*NL*
seemed
lost
in
thought
.
She
was
more
silent
,
quieter
,
and
,
if
she
cried
,
*NL*
she
cried
quietly
so
as
not
to
be
heard
.
The
captain
noticed
the
change
in
*NL*
her
with
mournful
perplexity
.
The
boys
'
visits
at
first
only
angered
her
,
*NL*
but
later
on
their
merry
shouts
and
stories
began
to
divert
her
,
and
at
*NL*
last
she
liked
them
so
much
that
,
if
the
boys
had
given
up
coming
,
she
*NL*
would
have
felt
dreary
without
them
.
When
the
children
told
some
story
or
*NL*
played
a
game
,
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
.
She
called
some
of
them
*NL*
to
her
and
kissed
them
.
She
was
particularly
fond
of
Smurov
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
captain
,
the
presence
in
his
room
of
the
children
,
who
came
to
*NL*
cheer
up
Ilusha
,
filled
his
heart
from
the
first
with
ecstatic
joy
.
He
*NL*
even
hoped
that
Ilusha
would
now
get
over
his
depression
,
and
that
that
*NL*
would
hasten
his
recovery
.
In
spite
of
his
alarm
about
Ilusha
,
he
had
not
,
*NL*
till
lately
,
felt
one
minute
's
doubt
of
his
boy
's
ultimate
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
his
little
visitors
with
homage
,
waited
upon
them
hand
and
foot
;
he
*NL*
was
ready
to
be
their
horse
and
even
began
letting
them
ride
on
his
back
,
*NL*
but
Ilusha
did
not
like
the
game
and
it
was
given
up
.
He
began
buying
*NL*
little
things
for
them
,
gingerbread
and
nuts
,
gave
them
tea
and
cut
them
*NL*
sandwiches
.
It
must
be
noted
that
all
this
time
he
had
plenty
of
money
.
He
*NL*
had
taken
the
two
hundred
roubles
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
just
as
Alyosha
*NL*
had
predicted
he
would
.
And
afterwards
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
learning
more
*NL*
about
their
circumstances
and
Ilusha
's
illness
,
visited
them
herself
,
made
*NL*
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
,
and
succeeded
in
fascinating
the
half
-
*NL*
imbecile
mother
.
Since
then
she
had
been
lavish
in
helping
them
,
and
the
*NL*
captain
,
terror-stricken
at
the
thought
that
his
boy
might
be
dying
,
*NL*
forgot
his
pride
and
humbly
accepted
her
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Doctor
Herzenstube
,
who
was
called
in
by
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
came
punctually
every
other
day
,
but
little
was
gained
by
his
visits
and
*NL*
he
dosed
the
invalid
mercilessly
.
But
on
that
Sunday
morning
a
new
doctor
*NL*
was
expected
,
who
had
come
from
Moscow
,
where
he
had
a
great
reputation
.
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
sent
for
him
from
Moscow
at
great
expense
,
not
*NL*
expressly
for
Ilusha
,
but
for
another
object
of
which
more
will
be
said
in
*NL*
its
place
hereafter
.
But
,
as
he
had
come
,
she
had
asked
him
to
see
Ilusha
*NL*
as
well
,
and
the
captain
had
been
told
to
expect
him
.
He
had
n't
the
*NL*
slightest
idea
that
Kolya
Krassotkin
was
coming
,
though
he
had
long
wished
*NL*
for
a
visit
from
the
boy
for
whom
Ilusha
was
fretting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Krassotkin
opened
the
door
and
came
into
the
room
,
the
*NL*
captain
and
all
the
boys
were
round
Ilusha
's
bed
,
looking
at
a
tiny
*NL*
mastiff
pup
,
which
had
only
been
born
the
day
before
,
though
the
captain
*NL*
had
bespoken
it
a
week
ago
to
comfort
and
amuse
Ilusha
,
who
was
still
*NL*
fretting
over
the
lost
and
probably
dead
Zhutchka
.
Ilusha
,
who
had
heard
*NL*
three
days
before
that
he
was
to
be
presented
with
a
puppy
,
not
an
*NL*
ordinary
puppy
,
but
a
pedigree
mastiff
-LRB-
a
very
important
point
,
of
*NL*
course
-RRB-
,
tried
from
delicacy
of
feeling
to
pretend
that
he
was
pleased
.
*NL*
But
his
father
and
the
boys
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
puppy
only
*NL*
served
to
recall
to
his
little
heart
the
thought
of
the
unhappy
dog
he
had
*NL*
killed
.
The
puppy
lay
beside
him
feebly
moving
and
he
,
smiling
sadly
,
*NL*
stroked
it
with
his
thin
,
pale
,
wasted
hand
.
Clearly
he
liked
the
puppy
,
*NL*
but
...
it
was
n't
Zhutchka
;
if
he
could
have
had
Zhutchka
and
the
puppy
,
*NL*
too
,
then
he
would
have
been
completely
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Krassotkin
!
''
cried
one
of
the
boys
suddenly
.
He
was
the
first
to
see
him
*NL*
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Krassotkin
's
entrance
made
a
general
sensation
;
the
boys
moved
away
and
*NL*
stood
on
each
side
of
the
bed
,
so
that
he
could
get
a
full
view
of
Ilusha
.
*NL*
The
captain
ran
eagerly
to
meet
Kolya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
in
...
you
are
welcome
!
''
he
said
hurriedly
.
``
Ilusha
,
Mr.
*NL*
Krassotkin
has
come
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Krassotkin
,
shaking
hands
with
him
hurriedly
,
instantly
showed
his
*NL*
complete
knowledge
of
the
manners
of
good
society
.
He
turned
first
to
the
*NL*
captain
's
wife
sitting
in
her
arm-chair
,
who
was
very
ill-humored
at
the
*NL*
moment
,
and
was
grumbling
that
the
boys
stood
between
her
and
Ilusha
's
bed
*NL*
and
did
not
let
her
see
the
new
puppy
.
With
the
greatest
courtesy
he
made
*NL*
her
a
bow
,
scraping
his
foot
,
and
turning
to
Nina
,
he
made
her
,
as
the
*NL*
only
other
lady
present
,
a
similar
bow
.
This
polite
behavior
made
an
*NL*
extremely
favorable
impression
on
the
deranged
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
can
see
at
once
he
is
a
young
man
that
has
been
well
brought
*NL*
up
,
''
she
commented
aloud
,
throwing
up
her
hands
;
``
but
as
for
our
other
*NL*
visitors
they
come
in
one
on
the
top
of
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
mamma
,
one
on
the
top
of
another
,
how
is
that
?
''
muttered
*NL*
the
captain
affectionately
,
though
a
little
anxious
on
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
they
ride
in
.
They
get
on
each
other
's
shoulders
in
the
*NL*
passage
and
prance
in
like
that
on
a
respectable
family
.
Strange
sort
of
*NL*
visitors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
's
come
in
like
that
,
mamma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
boy
came
in
riding
on
that
one
's
back
and
this
one
on
that
*NL*
one
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
was
already
by
Ilusha
's
bedside
.
The
sick
boy
turned
visibly
paler
.
*NL*
He
raised
himself
in
the
bed
and
looked
intently
at
Kolya
.
Kolya
had
not
*NL*
seen
his
little
friend
for
two
months
,
and
he
was
overwhelmed
at
the
sight
*NL*
of
him
.
He
had
never
imagined
that
he
would
see
such
a
wasted
,
yellow
*NL*
face
,
such
enormous
,
feverishly
glowing
eyes
and
such
thin
little
hands
.
*NL*
He
saw
,
with
grieved
surprise
,
Ilusha
's
rapid
,
hard
breathing
and
dry
*NL*
lips
.
He
stepped
close
to
him
,
held
out
his
hand
,
and
almost
overwhelmed
,
*NL*
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
old
man
...
how
are
you
?
''
But
his
voice
failed
him
,
he
could
n't
*NL*
achieve
an
appearance
of
ease
;
his
face
suddenly
twitched
and
the
corners
*NL*
of
his
mouth
quivered
.
Ilusha
smiled
a
pitiful
little
smile
,
still
unable
*NL*
to
utter
a
word
.
Something
moved
Kolya
to
raise
his
hand
and
pass
it
over
*NL*
Ilusha
's
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
!
''
he
murmured
softly
to
him
to
cheer
him
up
,
or
perhaps
not
*NL*
knowing
why
he
said
it
.
For
a
minute
they
were
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
so
you
've
got
a
new
puppy
?
''
Kolya
said
suddenly
,
in
a
most
callous
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
--
es
,
''
answered
Ilusha
in
a
long
whisper
,
gasping
for
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
black
nose
,
that
means
he
'll
be
fierce
,
a
good
house-dog
,
''
Kolya
*NL*
observed
gravely
and
stolidly
,
as
if
the
only
thing
he
cared
about
was
the
*NL*
puppy
and
its
black
nose
.
But
in
reality
he
still
had
to
do
his
utmost
to
*NL*
control
his
feelings
not
to
burst
out
crying
like
a
child
,
and
do
what
he
*NL*
would
he
could
not
control
it
.
``
When
it
grows
up
,
you
'll
have
to
keep
it
*NL*
on
the
chain
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
be
a
huge
dog
!
''
cried
one
of
the
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
will
,
''
``
a
mastiff
,
''
``
large
,
''
``
like
this
,
''
``
as
big
as
a
*NL*
calf
,
''
shouted
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
big
as
a
calf
,
as
a
real
calf
,
''
chimed
in
the
captain
.
``
I
got
one
like
*NL*
that
on
purpose
,
one
of
the
fiercest
breed
,
and
his
parents
are
huge
and
*NL*
very
fierce
,
they
stand
as
high
as
this
from
the
floor
...
Sit
down
here
,
*NL*
on
Ilusha
's
bed
,
or
here
on
the
bench
.
You
are
welcome
,
we
've
been
hoping
*NL*
to
see
you
a
long
time
...
You
were
so
kind
as
to
come
with
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Krassotkin
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
at
Ilusha
's
feet
.
Though
he
had
*NL*
perhaps
prepared
a
free-and-easy
opening
for
the
conversation
on
his
way
,
*NL*
now
he
completely
lost
the
thread
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
...
I
came
with
Perezvon
.
I
've
got
a
dog
now
,
called
Perezvon
.
A
*NL*
Slavonic
name
.
He
's
out
there
...
if
I
whistle
,
he
'll
run
in
.
I
've
brought
*NL*
a
dog
,
too
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Ilusha
all
at
once
.
``
Do
you
remember
*NL*
Zhutchka
,
old
man
?
''
he
suddenly
fired
the
question
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ilusha
's
little
face
quivered
.
He
looked
with
an
agonized
expression
at
*NL*
Kolya
.
Alyosha
,
standing
at
the
door
,
frowned
and
signed
to
Kolya
not
to
*NL*
speak
of
Zhutchka
,
but
he
did
not
or
would
not
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
...
is
Zhutchka
?
''
Ilusha
asked
in
a
broken
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
my
boy
,
your
Zhutchka
's
lost
and
done
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ilusha
did
not
speak
,
but
he
fixed
an
intent
gaze
once
more
on
Kolya
.
*NL*
Alyosha
,
catching
Kolya
's
eye
,
signed
to
him
vigorously
again
,
but
he
*NL*
turned
away
his
eyes
pretending
not
to
have
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
run
away
and
died
somewhere
.
It
must
have
died
after
a
meal
*NL*
like
that

''
Kolya
pronounced
pitilessly
,
though
he
seemed
a
little
*NL*
breathless
.
``
But
I
've
got
a
dog
,
Perezvon

A
Slavonic
name

I
've
*NL*
brought
him
to
show
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

said
Ilusha
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no
,
you
really
must
see
him

it
will
amuse
you

I
brought
him
on
*NL*
purpose

He
's
the
same
sort
of
shaggy
dog
...
You
allow
me
to
call
in
*NL*
my
dog

madam

He
suddenly
addressed
Madame
Snegiryov
,
with
inexplicable
*NL*
excitement
in
his
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
him
,
I
do
n't
want
him
!
''
cried
Ilusha
,
with
a
mournful
break
*NL*
in
his
voice
.
There
was
a
reproachful
light
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
,
''
the
captain
started
up
from
the
chest
by
the
wall
on
which
*NL*
he
had
just
sat
down
,
``
you
'd
better
...
another
time
,
''
he
muttered
,
but
*NL*
Kolya
could
not
be
restrained
.
He
hurriedly
shouted
to
Smurov
,
``
Open
the
*NL*
door
,
''
and
as
soon
as
it
was
open
,
he
blew
his
whistle
.
Perezvon
dashed
*NL*
headlong
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jump
,
Perezvon
,
beg
!
Beg
!
''
shouted
Kolya
,
jumping
up
,
and
the
dog
stood
*NL*
erect
on
its
hind-legs
by
Ilusha
's
bedside
.
What
followed
was
a
surprise
*NL*
to
every
one
:
Ilusha
started
,
lurched
violently
forward
,
bent
over
*NL*
Perezvon
and
gazed
at
him
,
faint
with
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
...
Zhutchka
!
''
he
cried
suddenly
,
in
a
voice
breaking
with
joy
and
*NL*
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
did
you
think
it
was
?
''
Krassotkin
shouted
with
all
his
might
,
in
*NL*
a
ringing
,
happy
voice
,
and
bending
down
he
seized
the
dog
and
lifted
him
*NL*
up
to
Ilusha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
old
man
,
you
see
,
blind
of
one
eye
and
the
left
ear
is
torn
,
just
*NL*
the
marks
you
described
to
me
.
It
was
by
that
I
found
him
.
I
found
him
*NL*
directly
.
He
did
not
belong
to
any
one
!
''
he
explained
,
turning
quickly
to
*NL*
the
captain
,
to
his
wife
,
to
Alyosha
and
then
again
to
Ilusha
.
``
He
used
to
*NL*
live
in
the
Fedotovs
'
back-yard
.
Though
he
made
his
home
there
,
they
did
*NL*
not
feed
him
.
He
was
a
stray
dog
that
had
run
away
from
the
village
...
I
*NL*
found
him
...
You
see
,
old
man
,
he
could
n't
have
swallowed
what
you
gave
*NL*
him
.
If
he
had
,
he
must
have
died
,
he
must
have

So
he
must
have
spat
it
*NL*
out
,
since
he
is
alive
.
You
did
not
see
him
do
it
.
But
the
pin
pricked
his
*NL*
tongue
,
that
is
why
he
squealed
.
He
ran
away
squealing
and
you
thought
*NL*
he
'd
swallowed
it
.
He
might
well
squeal
,
because
the
skin
of
dogs
'
mouths
*NL*
is
so
tender
...
tenderer
than
in
men
,
much
tenderer
!
''
Kolya
cried
*NL*
impetuously
,
his
face
glowing
and
radiant
with
delight
.
Ilusha
could
not
*NL*
speak
.
White
as
a
sheet
,
he
gazed
open-mouthed
at
Kolya
,
with
his
great
*NL*
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
his
head
.
And
if
Krassotkin
,
who
had
no
*NL*
suspicion
of
it
,
had
known
what
a
disastrous
and
fatal
effect
such
a
*NL*
moment
might
have
on
the
sick
child
's
health
,
nothing
would
have
induced
*NL*
him
to
play
such
a
trick
on
him
.
But
Alyosha
was
perhaps
the
only
person
*NL*
in
the
room
who
realized
it
.
As
for
the
captain
he
behaved
like
a
small
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zhutchka
!
It
's
Zhutchka
!
''
he
cried
in
a
blissful
voice
,
``
Ilusha
,
this
is
*NL*
Zhutchka
,
your
Zhutchka
!
Mamma
,
this
is
Zhutchka
!
''
He
was
almost
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
never
guessed
!
''
cried
Smurov
regretfully
.
``
Bravo
,
Krassotkin
!
I
*NL*
said
he
'd
find
the
dog
and
here
he
's
found
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
's
found
him
!
''
another
boy
repeated
gleefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Krassotkin
's
a
brick
!
''
cried
a
third
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
brick
,
he
's
a
brick
!
''
cried
the
other
boys
,
and
they
began
*NL*
clapping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
wait
,
''
Krassotkin
did
his
utmost
to
shout
above
them
all
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
how
it
happened
,
that
's
the
whole
point
.
I
found
him
,
I
took
him
*NL*
home
and
hid
him
at
once
.
I
kept
him
locked
up
at
home
and
did
not
show
*NL*
him
to
any
one
till
to-day
.
Only
Smurov
has
known
for
the
last
fortnight
,
*NL*
but
I
assured
him
this
dog
was
called
Perezvon
and
he
did
not
guess
.
And
*NL*
meanwhile
I
taught
the
dog
all
sorts
of
tricks
.
You
should
only
see
all
*NL*
the
things
he
can
do
!
I
trained
him
so
as
to
bring
you
a
well-trained
dog
,
*NL*
in
good
condition
,
old
man
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
to
you
,
`
See
,
old
man
,
*NL*
what
a
fine
dog
your
Zhutchka
is
now
!
'
Have
n't
you
a
bit
of
meat
?
He
'll
*NL*
show
you
a
trick
that
will
make
you
die
with
laughing
.
A
piece
of
meat
,
*NL*
have
n't
you
got
any
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
ran
across
the
passage
to
the
landlady
,
where
their
cooking
*NL*
was
done
.
Not
to
lose
precious
time
,
Kolya
,
in
desperate
haste
,
shouted
to
*NL*
Perezvon
,
``
Dead
!
''
And
the
dog
immediately
turned
round
and
lay
on
his
back
*NL*
with
its
four
paws
in
the
air
.
The
boys
laughed
.
Ilusha
looked
on
with
the
*NL*
same
suffering
smile
,
but
the
person
most
delighted
with
the
dog
's
*NL*
performance
was
``
mamma
.
''
She
laughed
at
the
dog
and
began
snapping
her
*NL*
fingers
and
calling
it
,
``
Perezvon
,
Perezvon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
will
make
him
get
up
,
nothing
!
''
Kolya
cried
triumphantly
,
proud
*NL*
of
his
success
.
``
He
wo
n't
move
for
all
the
shouting
in
the
world
,
but
if
I
*NL*
call
to
him
,
he
'll
jump
up
in
a
minute
.
Ici
,
Perezvon
!
''
The
dog
leapt
up
*NL*
and
bounded
about
,
whining
with
delight
.
The
captain
ran
back
with
a
piece
*NL*
of
cooked
beef
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
hot
?
''
Kolya
inquired
hurriedly
,
with
a
business-like
air
,
taking
*NL*
the
meat
.
``
Dogs
do
n't
like
hot
things
.
No
,
it
's
all
right
.
Look
,
*NL*
everybody
,
look
,
Ilusha
,
look
,
old
man
;
why
are
n't
you
looking
?
He
does
*NL*
not
look
at
him
,
now
I
've
brought
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
trick
consisted
in
making
the
dog
stand
motionless
with
his
nose
*NL*
out
and
putting
a
tempting
morsel
of
meat
just
on
his
nose
.
The
luckless
*NL*
dog
had
to
stand
without
moving
,
with
the
meat
on
his
nose
,
as
long
as
his
*NL*
master
chose
to
keep
him
,
without
a
movement
,
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
But
he
kept
Perezvon
only
for
a
brief
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paid
for
!
''
cried
Kolya
,
and
the
meat
passed
in
a
flash
from
the
dog
's
*NL*
nose
to
his
mouth
.
The
audience
,
of
course
,
expressed
enthusiasm
and
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
really
have
put
off
coming
all
this
time
simply
to
train
the
*NL*
dog
?
''
exclaimed
Alyosha
,
with
an
involuntary
note
of
reproach
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
for
that
!
''
answered
Kolya
,
with
perfect
simplicity
.
``
I
wanted
to
*NL*
show
him
in
all
his
glory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perezvon
!
Perezvon
,
''
called
Ilusha
suddenly
,
snapping
his
thin
fingers
*NL*
and
beckoning
to
the
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
Let
him
jump
up
on
the
bed
!
_
Ici
_
,
Perezvon
!
''
Kolya
slapped
*NL*
the
bed
and
Perezvon
darted
up
by
Ilusha
.
The
boy
threw
both
arms
round
*NL*
his
head
and
Perezvon
instantly
licked
his
cheek
.
Ilusha
crept
close
to
*NL*
him
,
stretched
himself
out
in
bed
and
hid
his
face
in
the
dog
's
shaggy
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
''
kept
exclaiming
the
captain
.
Kolya
sat
down
again
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
,
I
can
show
you
another
trick
.
I
've
brought
you
a
little
cannon
.
*NL*
You
remember
,
I
told
you
about
it
before
and
you
said
how
much
you
'd
like
*NL*
to
see
it
.
Well
,
here
,
I
've
brought
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Kolya
hurriedly
pulled
out
of
his
satchel
the
little
bronze
cannon
.
He
*NL*
hurried
,
because
he
was
happy
himself
.
Another
time
he
would
have
waited
*NL*
till
the
sensation
made
by
Perezvon
had
passed
off
,
now
he
hurried
on
*NL*
regardless
of
all
consideration
.
``
You
are
all
happy
now
,
''
he
felt
,
``
so
*NL*
here
's
something
to
make
you
happier
!
''
He
was
perfectly
enchanted
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
coveting
this
thing
for
a
long
while
;
it
's
for
you
,
old
man
,
*NL*
it
's
for
you
.
It
belonged
to
Morozov
,
it
was
no
use
to
him
,
he
had
it
from
*NL*
his
brother
.
I
swopped
a
book
from
father
's
book-case
for
it
,
_
A
Kinsman
*NL*
of
Mahomet
or
Salutary
Folly
_
,
a
scandalous
book
published
in
Moscow
a
*NL*
hundred
years
ago
,
before
they
had
any
censorship
.
And
Morozov
has
a
taste
*NL*
for
such
things
.
He
was
grateful
to
me
,
too
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
held
the
cannon
in
his
hand
so
that
all
could
see
and
admire
it
.
*NL*
Ilusha
raised
himself
,
and
,
with
his
right
arm
still
round
the
dog
,
he
*NL*
gazed
enchanted
at
the
toy
.
The
sensation
was
even
greater
when
Kolya
*NL*
announced
that
he
had
gunpowder
too
,
and
that
it
could
be
fired
off
at
*NL*
once
``
if
it
wo
n't
alarm
the
ladies
.
''
``
Mamma
''
immediately
asked
to
look
at
*NL*
the
toy
closer
and
her
request
was
granted
.
She
was
much
pleased
with
the
*NL*
little
bronze
cannon
on
wheels
and
began
rolling
it
to
and
fro
on
her
lap
.
*NL*
She
readily
gave
permission
for
the
cannon
to
be
fired
,
without
any
idea
*NL*
of
what
she
had
been
asked
.
Kolya
showed
the
powder
and
the
shot
.
The
*NL*
captain
,
as
a
military
man
,
undertook
to
load
it
,
putting
in
a
minute
*NL*
quantity
of
powder
.
He
asked
that
the
shot
might
be
put
off
till
another
*NL*
time
.
The
cannon
was
put
on
the
floor
,
aiming
towards
an
empty
part
of
the
*NL*
room
,
three
grains
of
powder
were
thrust
into
the
touch-hole
and
a
match
*NL*
was
put
to
it
.
A
magnificent
explosion
followed
.
Mamma
was
startled
,
but
*NL*
at
once
laughed
with
delight
.
The
boys
gazed
in
speechless
triumph
.
But
*NL*
the
captain
,
looking
at
Ilusha
,
was
more
enchanted
than
any
of
them
.
Kolya
*NL*
picked
up
the
cannon
and
immediately
presented
it
to
Ilusha
,
together
with
*NL*
the
powder
and
the
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
it
for
you
,
for
you
!
I
've
been
keeping
it
for
you
a
long
time
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
once
more
in
his
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
give
it
to
me
!
No
,
give
me
the
cannon
!
''
mamma
began
begging
like
a
*NL*
little
child
.
Her
face
showed
a
piteous
fear
that
she
would
not
get
it
.
*NL*
Kolya
was
disconcerted
.
The
captain
fidgeted
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
mamma
,
''
he
ran
to
her
,
``
the
cannon
's
yours
,
of
course
,
but
let
*NL*
Ilusha
have
it
,
because
it
's
a
present
to
him
,
but
it
's
just
as
good
as
*NL*
yours
.
Ilusha
will
always
let
you
play
with
it
;
it
shall
belong
to
both
of
*NL*
you
,
both
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
want
it
to
belong
to
both
of
us
,
I
want
it
to
be
mine
*NL*
altogether
,
not
Ilusha
's

''
persisted
mamma
,
on
the
point
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
mother
,
here
,
keep
it
!
''
Ilusha
cried
.
``
Krassotkin
,
may
I
give
it
*NL*
to
my
mother
?
''
he
turned
to
Krassotkin
with
an
imploring
face
,
as
though
*NL*
he
were
afraid
he
might
be
offended
at
his
giving
his
present
to
some
one
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
may
,
''
Krassotkin
assented
heartily
,
and
,
taking
the
cannon
*NL*
from
Ilusha
,
he
handed
it
himself
to
mamma
with
a
polite
bow
.
She
was
so
*NL*
touched
that
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
,
darling
,
he
's
the
one
who
loves
his
mamma
!
''
she
said
tenderly
,
*NL*
and
at
once
began
wheeling
the
cannon
to
and
fro
on
her
lap
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
let
me
kiss
your
hand
.
''
The
captain
darted
up
to
her
at
once
and
*NL*
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
never
saw
such
a
charming
fellow
as
this
nice
boy
,
''
said
the
*NL*
grateful
lady
,
pointing
to
Krassotkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
bring
you
as
much
powder
as
you
like
,
Ilusha
.
We
make
the
powder
*NL*
ourselves
now
.
Borovikov
found
out
how
it
's
made
--
twenty-four
parts
of
*NL*
saltpeter
,
ten
of
sulphur
and
six
of
birchwood
charcoal
.
It
's
all
pounded
*NL*
together
,
mixed
into
a
paste
with
water
and
rubbed
through
a
tammy
*NL*
sieve
--
that
's
how
it
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smurov
told
me
about
your
powder
,
only
father
says
it
's
not
real
*NL*
gunpowder

responded
Ilusha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
real
?
''
Kolya
flushed
.
``
It
burns
.
I
do
n't
know
,
of
course

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
mean
that
,
''
put
in
the
captain
with
a
guilty
face
.
``
I
only
*NL*
said
that
real
powder
is
not
made
like
that
,

that

nothing

be
*NL*
made
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

best

We
lighted
some
in
a
pomatum
pot

it
burned

splendidly
,
it
all
burnt
away
leaving
only
a
tiny
ash

But
that
was
only
*NL*
the
paste

and
if
you
rub
it
through

but
of
course
you
know
best

I
*NL*
do
n't

And
Bulkin
's
father
thrashed
him
on
account
of
our
powder

*NL*
did
you
hear
?
''
he
turned
to
Ilusha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Ilusha
.
He
listened
to
Kolya
with
immense
interest
and
*NL*
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
prepared
a
whole
bottle
of
it
and
he
used
to
keep
it
under
his
*NL*
bed

His
father
saw
it
.
He
said
it
might
explode
,
and
thrashed
him
on
the
*NL*
spot
.
He
was
going
to
make
a
complaint
against
me
to
the
masters

He
is
*NL*
not
allowed
to
go
about
with
me
now

no

is
allowed
to
go
about
with
me
*NL*
now

Smurov
is
not
allowed
to
either

I
've
got
a
bad
name
with
every
one

*NL*
They
say
I
'm
a
`
desperate
character

''
Kolya
smiled
scornfully
.
``
It
all
*NL*
began
from
what
happened
on
the
railway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
we
've
heard
of
that
exploit
of
yours

too

cried
the
captain
.
``
How
*NL*
could
you
lie
still
on
the
line

Is
it
possible
you
were
n't
the

afraid

lying
there
under
the
train
?
Were
n't
you
frightened

*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
abject
in
his
flattery
of
Kolya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
not
particularly
,
''
answered
Kolya
carelessly
.
``
What
's
blasted
my
*NL*
reputation
more
than
anything
here
was
that
cursed
goose

he
said
,
*NL*
turning
again
to
Ilusha
.
But
though
he
assumed
an
unconcerned
air
as
he
*NL*
talked
,
he
still
could
not
control
himself
and
was
continually
missing
the
*NL*
note
he
tried
to
keep
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
heard
about
the
goose
!
''
Ilusha
laughed
,
beaming
all
over
.
``
They
*NL*
told
me
,
but
I
did
n't
understand
.
Did
they
really
take
you
to
the
court
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
stupid
,
trivial
affair
,
they
made
a
mountain
of
a
molehill
as
*NL*
they
always
do
,
''
Kolya
began
carelessly
.
``
I
was
walking
through
the
*NL*
market-place
here
one
day
,
just
when
they
'd
driven
in
the
geese
.
I
stopped
*NL*
and
looked
at
them
.
All
at
once
a
fellow
,
who
is
an
errand-boy
at
*NL*
Plotnikov
's
now
,
looked
at
me
and
said
,
`
What
are
you
looking
at
the
geese
*NL*
for
?
'
I
looked
at
him
;
he
was
a
stupid
,
moon-faced
fellow
of
twenty
.
I
am
*NL*
always
on
the
side
of
the
peasantry
,
you
know
.
I
like
talking
to
the
*NL*
peasants
...
We
've
dropped
behind
the
peasants
--
that
's
an
axiom
.
I
believe
*NL*
you
are
laughing
,
Karamazov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Heaven
forbid
,
I
am
listening
,
''
said
Alyosha
with
a
most
good-natured
*NL*
air
,
and
the
sensitive
Kolya
was
immediately
reassured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
theory
,
Karamazov
,
is
clear
and
simple
,
''
he
hurried
on
again
,
looking
*NL*
pleased
.
``
I
believe
in
the
people
and
am
always
glad
to
give
them
their
*NL*
due
,
but
I
am
not
for
spoiling
them
,
that
is
a
_
sine
qua
non
_
...
But
I
*NL*
was
telling
you
about
the
goose
.
So
I
turned
to
the
fool
and
answered
,
'
I
*NL*
am
wondering
what
the
goose
thinks
about
.
'
He
looked
at
me
quite
stupidly
,
*NL*
`
And
what
does
the
goose
think
about
?
'
he
asked
.
`
Do
you
see
that
cart
*NL*
full
of
oats
?
'
I
said
.
`
The
oats
are
dropping
out
of
the
sack
,
and
the
*NL*
goose
has
put
its
neck
right
under
the
wheel
to
gobble
them
up
--
do
you
*NL*
see
?
'
'
I
see
that
quite
well
,
'
he
said
.
`
Well
,
'
said
I
,
`
if
that
cart
were
*NL*
to
move
on
a
little
,
would
it
break
the
goose
's
neck
or
not
?
'
`
It
'd
be
*NL*
sure
to
break
it
,
'
and
he
grinned
all
over
his
face
,
highly
delighted
.
*NL*
`
Come
on
,
then
,
'
said
I
,
`
let
's
try
.
'
`
Let
's
,
'
he
said
.
And
it
did
not
*NL*
take
us
long
to
arrange
:
he
stood
at
the
bridle
without
being
noticed
,
and
*NL*
I
stood
on
one
side
to
direct
the
goose
.
And
the
owner
was
n't
looking
,
he
*NL*
was
talking
to
some
one
,
so
I
had
nothing
to
do
,
the
goose
thrust
its
head
*NL*
in
after
the
oats
of
itself
,
under
the
cart
,
just
under
the
wheel
.
I
*NL*
winked
at
the
lad
,
he
tugged
at
the
bridle
,
and
crack
.
The
goose
's
neck
*NL*
was
broken
in
half
.
And
,
as
luck
would
have
it
,
all
the
peasants
saw
us
at
*NL*
that
moment
and
they
kicked
up
a
shindy
at
once
.
`
You
did
that
on
*NL*
purpose
!
'
`
No
,
not
on
purpose
.
'
`
Yes
,
you
did
,
on
purpose
!
'
Well
,
they
*NL*
shouted
,
`
Take
him
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
!
'
They
took
me
,
too
.
`
You
*NL*
were
there
,
too
,
'
they
said
,
`
you
helped
,
you
're
known
all
over
the
*NL*
market
!
'
And
,
for
some
reason
,
I
really
am
known
all
over
the
market
,
''
*NL*
Kolya
added
conceitedly
.
``
We
all
went
off
to
the
justice
's
,
they
brought
*NL*
the
goose
,
too
.
The
fellow
was
crying
in
a
great
funk
,
simply
blubbering
*NL*
like
a
woman
.
And
the
farmer
kept
shouting
that
you
could
kill
any
number
*NL*
of
geese
like
that
.
Well
,
of
course
,
there
were
witnesses
.
The
justice
of
*NL*
the
peace
settled
it
in
a
minute
,
that
the
farmer
was
to
be
paid
a
rouble
*NL*
for
the
goose
,
and
the
fellow
to
have
the
goose
.
And
he
was
warned
not
to
*NL*
play
such
pranks
again
.
And
the
fellow
kept
blubbering
like
a
woman
.
`
It
*NL*
was
n't
me
,
'
he
said
,
`
it
was
he
egged
me
on
,
'
and
he
pointed
to
me
.
I
*NL*
answered
with
the
utmost
composure
that
I
had
n't
egged
him
on
,
that
I
*NL*
simply
stated
the
general
proposition
,
had
spoken
hypothetically
.
The
*NL*
justice
of
the
peace
smiled
and
was
vexed
with
himself
at
once
for
having
*NL*
smiled
.
`
I
'll
complain
to
your
masters
of
you
,
so
that
for
the
future
you
*NL*
may
n't
waste
your
time
on
such
general
propositions
,
instead
of
sitting
at
*NL*
your
books
and
learning
your
lessons
.
'
He
did
n't
complain
to
the
masters
,
*NL*
that
was
a
joke
,
but
the
matter
was
noised
abroad
and
came
to
the
ears
of
*NL*
the
masters
.
Their
ears
are
long
,
you
know
!
The
classical
master
,
*NL*
Kolbasnikov
,
was
particularly
shocked
about
it
,
but
Dardanelov
got
me
off
*NL*
again
.
But
Kolbasnikov
is
savage
with
every
one
now
like
a
green
ass
.
Did
*NL*
you
know
,
Ilusha
,
he
is
just
married
,
got
a
dowry
of
a
thousand
roubles
,
*NL*
and
his
bride
's
a
regular
fright
of
the
first
rank
and
the
last
degree
.
*NL*
The
third-class
fellows
wrote
an
epigram
on
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Astounding
news
has
reached
the
class
,
*NL*
Kolbasnikov
has
been
an
ass
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
on
,
awfully
funny
,
I
'll
bring
it
to
you
later
on
.
I
say
nothing
*NL*
against
Dardanelov
,
he
is
a
learned
man
,
there
's
no
doubt
about
it
.
I
*NL*
respect
men
like
that
and
it
's
not
because
he
stood
up
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
took
him
down
about
the
founders
of
Troy
!
''
Smurov
put
in
*NL*
suddenly
,
unmistakably
proud
of
Krassotkin
at
such
a
moment
.
He
was
*NL*
particularly
pleased
with
the
story
of
the
goose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
really
take
him
down
?
''
the
captain
inquired
,
in
a
flattering
way
.
*NL*
``
On
the
question
who
founded
Troy
?
We
heard
of
it
,
Ilusha
told
me
about
it
*NL*
at
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
everything
,
father
,
he
knows
more
than
any
of
us
!
''
put
in
*NL*
Ilusha
;
``
he
only
pretends
to
be
like
that
,
but
really
he
is
top
in
every
*NL*
subject
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ilusha
looked
at
Kolya
with
infinite
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
all
nonsense
about
Troy
,
a
trivial
matter
.
I
consider
this
an
*NL*
unimportant
question
,
''
said
Kolya
with
haughty
humility
.
He
had
by
now
*NL*
completely
recovered
his
dignity
,
though
he
was
still
a
little
uneasy
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
he
was
greatly
excited
and
that
he
had
talked
about
the
goose
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
with
too
little
reserve
,
while
Alyosha
had
looked
serious
*NL*
and
had
not
said
a
word
all
the
time
.
And
the
vain
boy
began
by
degrees
to
*NL*
have
a
rankling
fear
that
Alyosha
was
silent
because
he
despised
him
,
and
*NL*
thought
he
was
showing
off
before
him
.
If
he
dared
to
think
anything
like
*NL*
that
Kolya
would
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
regard
the
question
as
quite
a
trivial
one
,
''
he
rapped
out
again
,
*NL*
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
know
who
founded
Troy
,
''
a
boy
,
who
had
not
spoken
before
,
said
*NL*
suddenly
,
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
.
He
was
silent
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
shy
.
He
was
a
pretty
boy
of
about
eleven
,
called
Kartashov
.
He
was
sitting
*NL*
near
the
door
.
Kolya
looked
at
him
with
dignified
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
the
identity
of
the
founders
of
Troy
had
become
a
secret
*NL*
for
the
whole
school
,
a
secret
which
could
only
be
discovered
by
reading
*NL*
Smaragdov
,
and
no
one
had
Smaragdov
but
Kolya
.
One
day
,
when
Kolya
's
back
*NL*
was
turned
,
Kartashov
hastily
opened
Smaragdov
,
which
lay
among
Kolya
's
*NL*
books
,
and
immediately
lighted
on
the
passage
relating
to
the
foundation
*NL*
of
Troy
.
This
was
a
good
time
ago
,
but
he
felt
uneasy
and
could
not
bring
*NL*
himself
to
announce
publicly
that
he
too
knew
who
had
founded
Troy
,
afraid
*NL*
of
what
might
happen
and
of
Krassotkin
's
somehow
putting
him
to
shame
over
*NL*
it
.
But
now
he
could
n't
resist
saying
it
.
For
weeks
he
had
been
longing
*NL*
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
did
found
it
?
''
asked
Kolya
,
turning
to
him
with
haughty
*NL*
superciliousness
.
He
saw
from
his
face
that
he
really
did
know
and
at
once
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
how
to
take
it
.
There
was
,
so
to
speak
,
a
discordant
note
*NL*
in
the
general
harmony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Troy
was
founded
by
Teucer
,
Dardanus
,
Ilius
and
Tros
,
''
the
boy
rapped
out
*NL*
at
once
,
and
in
the
same
instant
he
blushed
,
blushed
so
,
that
it
was
*NL*
painful
to
look
at
him
.
But
the
boys
stared
at
him
,
stared
at
him
for
a
*NL*
whole
minute
,
and
then
all
the
staring
eyes
turned
at
once
and
were
*NL*
fastened
upon
Kolya
,
who
was
still
scanning
the
audacious
boy
with
*NL*
disdainful
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
sense
did
they
found
it
?
''
he
deigned
to
comment
at
last
.
``
And
*NL*
what
is
meant
by
founding
a
city
or
a
state
?
What
do
they
do
?
Did
they
go
*NL*
and
each
lay
a
brick
,
do
you
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
laughter
.
The
offending
boy
turned
from
pink
to
crimson
.
He
was
*NL*
silent
and
on
the
point
of
tears
.
Kolya
held
him
so
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
you
talk
of
a
historical
event
like
the
foundation
of
a
*NL*
nationality
,
you
must
first
understand
what
you
mean
by
it
,
''
he
admonished
*NL*
him
in
stern
,
incisive
tones
.
``
But
I
attach
no
consequence
to
these
old
*NL*
wives
'
tales
and
I
do
n't
think
much
of
universal
history
in
general
,
''
he
*NL*
added
carelessly
,
addressing
the
company
generally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Universal
history
?
''
the
captain
inquired
,
looking
almost
scared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
universal
history
!
It
's
the
study
of
the
successive
follies
of
*NL*
mankind
and
nothing
more
.
The
only
subjects
I
respect
are
mathematics
and
*NL*
natural
science
,
''
said
Kolya
.
He
was
showing
off
and
he
stole
a
glance
at
*NL*
Alyosha
;
his
was
the
only
opinion
he
was
afraid
of
there
.
But
Alyosha
was
*NL*
still
silent
and
still
serious
as
before
.
If
Alyosha
had
said
a
word
it
*NL*
would
have
stopped
him
,
but
Alyosha
was
silent
and
``
it
might
be
the
*NL*
silence
of
contempt
,
''
and
that
finally
irritated
Kolya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
classical
languages
,
too
...
they
are
simply
madness
,
nothing
more
.
*NL*
You
seem
to
disagree
with
me
again
,
Karamazov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
study
of
the
classics
,
if
you
ask
my
opinion
,
is
simply
a
police
*NL*
measure
,
that
's
simply
why
it
has
been
introduced
into
our
schools
.
''
By
*NL*
degrees
Kolya
began
to
get
breathless
again
.
``
Latin
and
Greek
were
*NL*
introduced
because
they
are
a
bore
and
because
they
stupefy
the
intellect
.
*NL*
It
was
dull
before
,
so
what
could
they
do
to
make
things
duller
?
It
was
*NL*
senseless
enough
before
,
so
what
could
they
do
to
make
it
more
senseless
?
*NL*
So
they
thought
of
Greek
and
Latin
.
That
's
my
opinion
,
I
hope
I
shall
*NL*
never
change
it
,
''
Kolya
finished
abruptly
.
His
cheeks
were
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
assented
Smurov
suddenly
,
in
a
ringing
tone
of
conviction
.
*NL*
He
had
listened
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
he
is
first
in
Latin
himself
,
''
cried
one
of
the
group
of
boys
*NL*
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
,
he
says
that
and
yet
he
is
first
in
Latin
,
''
echoed
Ilusha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
it
?
''
Kolya
thought
fit
to
defend
himself
,
though
the
praise
was
*NL*
very
sweet
to
him
.
``
I
am
fagging
away
at
Latin
because
I
have
to
,
because
*NL*
I
promised
my
mother
to
pass
my
examination
,
and
I
think
that
whatever
you
*NL*
do
,
it
's
worth
doing
it
well
.
But
in
my
soul
I
have
a
profound
contempt
*NL*
for
the
classics
and
all
that
fraud
...
You
do
n't
agree
,
Karamazov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
`
fraud
'
?
''
Alyosha
smiled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
the
classical
authors
have
been
translated
into
all
languages
,
*NL*
so
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
studying
the
classics
they
introduced
Latin
,
*NL*
but
solely
as
a
police
measure
,
to
stupefy
the
intelligence
.
So
what
can
*NL*
one
call
it
but
a
fraud
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
taught
you
all
this
?

cried
Alyosha
,
surprised
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
I
am
capable
of
thinking
for
myself
without
being
*NL*
taught

Besides
,
what
I
said
just
now
about
the
classics
being
translated
*NL*
our
teacher
Kolbasnikov
has
said
to
the
whole
of

``

cried
Nina
,
who
had
been
silent
till
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
carriage
belonging
to
Madame
Hohlakov
drove
up
to
the
gate
.
The
captain
,
*NL*
who
had
been
expecting
the
doctor
all
the
morning
,
rushed
headlong
out
to
*NL*
meet
him
.
``
Mamma
''
pulled
herself
together
and
assumed
a
dignified
air
.
*NL*
Alyosha
went
up
to
Ilusha
and
began
setting
his
pillows
straight
.
Nina
,
*NL*
from
her
invalid
chair
,
anxiously
watched
him
putting
the
bed
tidy
.
The
*NL*
boys
hurriedly
took
leave
.
Some
of
them
promised
to
come
again
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
Kolya
called
Perezvon
and
the
dog
jumped
off
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
go
away
,
I
wo
n't
go
away
,
''
Kolya
said
hastily
to
Ilusha
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
wait
in
the
passage
and
come
back
when
the
doctor
's
gone
,
I
'll
come
back
*NL*
with
Perezvon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
now
the
doctor
had
entered
,
an
important-looking
person
with
long
,
*NL*
dark
whiskers
and
a
shiny
,
shaven
chin
,
wearing
a
bearskin
coat
.
As
he
*NL*
crossed
the
threshold
he
stopped
,
taken
aback
;
he
probably
fancied
he
had
*NL*
come
to
the
wrong
place
.
``
How
is
this
?
Where
am
I
?
''
he
muttered
,
not
*NL*
removing
his
coat
nor
his
peaked
sealskin
cap
.
The
crowd
,
the
poverty
of
*NL*
the
room
,
the
washing
hanging
on
a
line
in
the
corner
,
puzzled
him
.
The
*NL*
captain
,
bent
double
,
was
bowing
low
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
here
,
sir
,
here
,
sir
,
''
he
muttered
cringingly
;
``
it
's
here
,
you
've
*NL*
come
right
,
you
were
coming
to
us
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sne-gi-ryov
?
''
the
doctor
said
loudly
and
pompously
.
``
Mr.
Snegiryov
--
is
*NL*
that
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
me
,

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
looked
round
the
room
with
a
squeamish
air
once
more
and
threw
*NL*
off
his
coat
,
displaying
to
all
eyes
the
grand
decoration
at
his
neck
.
The
*NL*
captain
caught
the
fur
coat
in
the
air
,
and
the
doctor
took
off
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
patient
?

he
asked
emphatically

*NL*
``
What

Kolya
asked
quickly
.
``

has

he

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
is
dying

I
think
that

answered
Alyosha
,
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
rogues
!
Medicine

I
am
glad
to
have
made
your

acquaintance

Karamazov
.
I
wanted
to
know
you
for
a
long
time
.
I
*NL*
am
only
sorry
we
meet
in
such
sad
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
had
a
great
inclination
to
say
something
even
warmer
and
more
*NL*
demonstrative
,
but
he
felt
ill
at
ease
.
Alyosha
noticed
this
,
smiled
,
and
*NL*
pressed
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
long
learned
to
respect
you
as
a
rare
person
,
''
Kolya
muttered
again
,
*NL*
faltering
and
uncertain
.
``
I
have
heard
you
are
a
mystic
and
have
been
in
*NL*
the
monastery
.
I
know
you
are

,
but
...
that
has
n't
put
me
off
.
*NL*
Contact

cure
you

It
's
always
so
with
characters
*NL*
like
yours

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
mystic
?
Cure
me
of
what
?
''
Alyosha
was
rather
*NL*
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
God
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

do
n't
you
believe
in

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
nothing
against

Of

only
a

I
admit
that
He
is
needed

for
the

of

all

that

there
were
no

*NL*
added
Kolya
,
beginning
to
blush
.
He
suddenly
fancied
that
Alyosha
might
*NL*
think
he
was
trying
to
show
off
his
knowledge
and
to
prove
that
he
was
*NL*
``
grown
up

''
``
I
have
n't
the
slightest
desire
to
show
off
my
knowledge
to
*NL*
him
,
''
Kolya
thought
indignantly
.
And
all
of
a
sudden
he
felt
horribly
*NL*
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
I
ca
n't
endure
entering
on
such
discussions
,
''
he
said
with
*NL*
a
final
air
.
``
It
's
possible
for
one
who
does
n't
believe
in
God
to
love
*NL*
mankind
,
do

think
so

and
loved

mankind

-LRB-
``
I
am
at
it
again

he
thought
to
himself
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``

believed
in

said
Alyosha
quietly
,
gently
,
*NL*
and
quite
naturally
,
as
though
he
were
talking
to
some
one
of
his
own
age
,
*NL*
or
even
older
.
Kolya
was
particularly
struck
by
Alyosha
's
apparent
*NL*
diffidence
about
his
opinion
of
Voltaire
.
He
seemed
to
be
leaving
the
*NL*
question
for
him
,
little
Kolya
,
to
settle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

read

Alyosha
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not
to

can

Kolya
was
getting
mixed
by
now
.
``
I
am
a
Socialist

Karamazov

I
*NL*

an
incurable

he
announced
suddenly
,
apropos
of
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

laughed
Alyosha
.
``
But
when
have
you
had
time
to

thought

were
only

*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
winced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first

I

not

fourteen

fourteen

he
flushed
angrily
,
``

Alyosha
answered
serenely
and
modestly
,
but
Kolya
interrupted
him
*NL*
hotly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

you
want
obedience

only
been
of
use

powerful

it

*NL*
``
Ah

Alyosha

*NL*
``

exclaimed
Alyosha

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

out

I
read

criticism

`
Show
a

schoolboy

he
writes

a
map
of

stars

which
he
knows
nothing
about

*NL*
and
he
will
give
you
back
the
map
next
day
with
corrections
on
it
.
'
No
*NL*
knowledge
and
unbounded
conceit
--
that
's
what
the
German
meant
to
say
about
*NL*
the
Russian
schoolboy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
's
perfectly
right

Kolya
laughed
suddenly
,
``
exactly
so
!
Bravo
*NL*
the
German
!
But
he
did
not
see
the
good
side
,
what
do
you
think
?
Conceit
*NL*
may
be
,
that
comes
from
youth
,
that
will
be
corrected
if
need
be
,
but
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand

there
is
an
independent
spirit
almost
from
childhood
,
*NL*
boldness
of
thought
and
conviction
,
and
not
the
spirit
of
these
sausage
*NL*
makers
,
groveling
before
authority
...
But
the
German
was
right
all
the
*NL*
same
.
Bravo
the
German
!
But
Germans
want
strangling
all
the
same
.
Though
*NL*
they
are
so
good
at
science
and
learning
they
must
be
strangled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strangled
,
what
for
?
''
smiled
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
I
am
talking
nonsense
,
I
agree
.
I
am
awfully
childish
*NL*
sometimes
,
and
when
I
am
pleased
about
anything
I
ca
n't
restrain
myself
*NL*
and
am
ready
to
talk
any
stuff
.
But
,
I
say
,
we
are
chattering
away
here
*NL*
about
nothing
,
and
that
doctor
has
been
a
long
time
in
there
.
But
perhaps
*NL*
he
's
examining
the
mamma
and
that
poor
crippled
Nina
.
I
liked
that
Nina
,
*NL*
you
know
.
She
whispered
to
me
suddenly
as
I
was
coming
away
,
`
Why
did
n't
*NL*
you
come
before
?
'
And
in
such
a
voice
,
so
reproachfully
!
I
think
she
is
*NL*
awfully
nice
and
pathetic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
Well
,
you
'll
be
coming
often
,
you
will
see
what
she
is
like
.
It
*NL*
would
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
to
know
people
like
that
,
to
learn
to
*NL*
value
a
great
deal
which
you
will
find
out
from
knowing
these
people
,
''
*NL*
Alyosha
observed
warmly
.
``
That
would
have
more
effect
on
you
than
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
I
regret
and
blame
myself
for
not
having
come
sooner
!
''
Kolya
*NL*
exclaimed
,
with
bitter
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
great
pity
.
You
saw
for
yourself
how
delighted
the
poor
child
*NL*
was
to
see
you
.
And
how
he
fretted
for
you
to
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
me
!
You
make
it
worse
!
But
it
serves
me
right
.
What
kept
me
*NL*
from
coming
was
my
conceit
,
my
egoistic
vanity
,
and
the
beastly
*NL*
wilfullness
,
which
I
never
can
get
rid
of
,
though
I
've
been
struggling
*NL*
with
it
all
my
life
.
I
see
that
now
.
I
am
a
beast
in
lots
of
ways
,
*NL*
Karamazov
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
have
a
charming
nature
,
though
it
's
been
distorted
,
and
I
quite
*NL*
understand
why
you
have
had
such
an
influence
on
this
generous
,
morbidly
*NL*
sensitive
boy
,
''
Alyosha
answered
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
say
that
to
me
!
''
cried
Kolya
;
``
and
would
you
believe
it
,
I
*NL*
thought
--
I
've
thought
several
times
since
I
've
been
here
--
that
you
despised
*NL*
me
!
If
only
you
knew
how
I
prize
your
opinion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
you
really
so
sensitive

At
your
age
!
Would
you
believe
it
,
just
*NL*
now
,
when
you
were
telling
your
story
,
I
thought
,
as
I
watched
you
,
that
*NL*
you
must
be
very
sensitive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
so
?
What
an
eye
you
've
got
,
I
say
!
I
bet
that
was
when
I
was
*NL*
talking
about
the
goose
.
That
was
just
when
I
was
fancying
you
had
a
great
*NL*
contempt
for
me
for
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
show
off
,
and
for
a
moment
I
*NL*
quite
hated
you
for
it
,
and
began
talking
like
a
fool
.
Then
I
fancied
--
just
*NL*
now
,
here
--
when
I
said
that
if
there
were
no
God
He
would
have
to
be
*NL*
invented
,
that
I
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
display
my
knowledge
,
*NL*
especially
as
I
got
that
phrase
out
of
a
book
.
But
I
swear
I
was
n't
*NL*
showing
off
out
of
vanity
,
though
I
really
do
n't
know
why
.
Because
I
was
*NL*
so
pleased
?
Yes
,
I
believe
it
was
because
I
was
so
pleased
...
though
it
's
*NL*
perfectly
disgraceful
for
any
one
to
be
gushing
directly
they
are
pleased
,
*NL*
I
know
that
.
But
I
am
convinced
now
that
you
do
n't
despise
me
;
it
was
all
*NL*
my
imagination
.
Oh
,
Karamazov
,
I
am
profoundly
unhappy
.
I
sometimes
fancy
*NL*
all
sorts
of
things
,
that
every
one
is
laughing
at
me
,
the
whole
world
,
*NL*
and
then
I
feel
ready
to
overturn
the
whole
order
of
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
worry
every
one
about
you
,
''
smiled
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
worry
every
one
about
me
,
especially
my
mother
.
Karamazov

tell
*NL*
me

I
very
ridiculous
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

cried
Alyosha

``
And
*NL*
what
does
ridiculous
mean

Is
n't
every
one
constantly
being
or
seeming
*NL*
ridiculous
?
Besides
,
nearly
all
clever
people
now
are
fearfully
afraid
of
*NL*
being
ridiculous
,
and
that
makes
them
unhappy
.
All
I
am
surprised
at
is
*NL*
that
you
should
be
feeling
that
so
early
,
though
I
've
observed
it
for
some
*NL*
time
past
,
and
not
only
in
you
.
Nowadays
the
very
children
have
begun
to
*NL*
suffer
from
it
.
It
's
almost
a
sort
of
insanity
.
The
devil
has
taken
the
*NL*
form
of
that
vanity
and
entered
into
the
whole
generation
;
it
's
simply
the
*NL*
devil

added
Alyosha
,
without
a
trace
of
the
smile
that
Kolya
,
staring
at
*NL*
him
,
expected
to
see
.
``
You
are
like
every

else

''
said
Alyosha
,
in
*NL*
conclusion
,
``
that
is
,
like
very
many
others

Only
you
must
not
be

all

here
you
are
not

confess

something
bad

even
ridiculous

And
who
will
admit
so
much
in
these

days

No

And
people
have
even
ceased
to
feel
the
impulse

I
have
longed

know
you

I
've
long
been
eager
for
this
*NL*
meeting

Can
you
really
have
thought
about

just
now
that

of
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
'd
heard

you

too

vanity
that
makes
you
ask

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

our
talk
has
been

declaration

in

bashful
and

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

been
a
good
thing

Alyosha
smiled
brightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
know

must
admit

see
it
by

Kolya
smiled
with
a
sort
of
sly
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ashamed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

why
are
you
blushing

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
made
me
blush

laughed
Alyosha

and
he
really
did
blush

well

I
am
a

why

I
do

almost
embarrassed

*NL*
``
Oh

how
I
love
you

admire
you
at
this

are
just
like

cried
Kolya
,
in
positive
*NL*
ecstasy

His
cheeks
glowed
,
his
eyes
beamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

Kolya

you
will
be
very

made

Alyosha
say
suddenly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I

Kolya
agreed
at

*NL*
``
But
you

bless

*NL*
``

saying

loved

laughed
gayly

*NL*

The
doctor
came
out
of
the
room
again
,
muffled
in
his
fur
coat
and
with
*NL*
his
cap
on
his
head
.
His
face
looked
almost
angry
and
disgusted
,
as
though
*NL*
he
were
afraid
of
getting
dirty
.
He
cast
a
cursory
glance
round
the
*NL*
passage
,
looking
sternly
at
Alyosha
and
Kolya
as
he
did
so
.
Alyosha
waved
*NL*
from
the
door
to
the
coachman
,
and
the
carriage
that
had
brought
the
*NL*
doctor
drove
up
.
The
captain
darted
out
after
the
doctor
,
and
,
bowing
*NL*
apologetically
,
stopped
him
to
get
the
last
word
.
The
poor
fellow
looked
*NL*
utterly
crushed
;
there
was
a
scared
look
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Excellency
,
your
Excellency
...
is
it
possible
?
''
he
began
,
but
could
*NL*
not
go
on
and
clasped
his
hands
in
despair
.
Yet
he
still
gazed
imploringly
*NL*
at
the
doctor
,
as
though
a
word
from
him
might
still
change
the
poor
boy
's
*NL*
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it

I
am
not

the
doctor
answered
offhand
,
though
with
*NL*
the
customary
impressiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

your

will
it
be
soon

*NL*

``
You

said
the
doctor
in
emphatic
and
*NL*
incisive
tones
,
and
dropping
his
eyes
,
he
was
about
to
step
out
to
the
*NL*
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

the
terror-stricken

stopped

him
again

can
nothing

absolutely
nothing

said
the
doctor
impatiently
,
``

he
*NL*
stopped
suddenly
.
``

the
words
``

the
*NL*
doctor
uttered
with
an
almost
wrathful
sternness
that
made
the
captain

start

unable

what
was

*NL*
``

Kolya
jerked
out
suddenly
in
explanation

*NL*
doctor
looked
at
him
.

*NL*
``

faltered
the
captain

spread
out
his

indicating
his

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

The
captain
flung
wide
his

again

despairingly

indicating
the
bare
wooden
walls
of
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

the

out

loudly
,
noticing
the
doctor
's
rather
uneasy
glance
at
Perezvon
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
in
the
doorway

There
was
a
wrathful
note
in
Kolya
's
voice

He
*NL*
used
the
word
apothecary
instead
of
doctor
on
purpose
,
and
,
as
he
*NL*
explained
afterwards
,
used
it
``
to
insult
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

The
doctor
flung
up
his

staring
with
surprise
at

Kolya

``
Who

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
this
?
Who
's
this
?
''
The
doctor
flew
into
a
terrible
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
schoolboy
,
doctor
,
he
is
a
mischievous
boy
;
take
no
notice
of
*NL*
him
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
frowning
and
speaking
quickly
.
``
Kolya
,
hold
your
*NL*
tongue
!
''
he
cried
to
Krassotkin
.
``
Take
no
notice
of
him
,
doctor
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
rather
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
a
thrashing
,
a
good
thrashing
!
''
The
doctor
stamped
in
a
perfect
*NL*
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
,
apothecary
,
my
Perezvon
might
bite
!
''
said
Kolya
,
turning
*NL*
pale
,
with
quivering
voice
and
flashing
eyes
.
''
_
Ici
_
,
Perezvon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kolya
,
if
you
say
another
word
,
I
'll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
,
''
*NL*
Alyosha
cried
peremptorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
only
one
man
in
the
world
who
can
command
Nikolay
*NL*
Krassotkin
--
this
is
the
man
''
;
Kolya
pointed
to
Alyosha
.
``
I
obey
him
,
good
-
*NL*
by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
forward
,
opened
the
door
,
and
quickly
went
into
the
inner
room
.
*NL*
Perezvon
flew
after
him
.
The
doctor
stood
still
for
five
seconds
in
*NL*
amazement
,
looking
at
Alyosha
;
then
,
with
a
curse
,
he
went
out
quickly
to
*NL*
the
carriage
,
repeating
aloud
,
``
This
is
...
this
is
...
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
it
is
!
''
The
captain
darted
forward
to
help
him
into
the
carriage
.
Alyosha
*NL*
followed
Kolya
into
the
room
.
He
was
already
by
Ilusha
's
bedside
.
The
sick
*NL*
boy
was
holding
his
hand
and
calling
for
his
father
.
A
minute
later
the
*NL*
captain
,
too
,
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
father
,
come
...
we
...
''
Ilusha
faltered
in
violent
excitement
,
*NL*
but
apparently
unable
to
go
on
,
he
flung
his
wasted
arms
round
his
father
*NL*
and
Kolya
,
uniting
them
in
one
embrace
,
and
hugging
them
as
tightly
as
he
*NL*
could
.
The
captain
suddenly
began
to
shake
with
dumb
sobs
,
and
Kolya
's
*NL*
lips
and
chin
twitched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
father
!
How
sorry
I
am
for
you
!
''
Ilusha
moaned
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
...
darling
...
the
doctor
said
...
you
would
be
all
right
...
we
*NL*
shall
be
happy
...
the
doctor
...
''
the
captain
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
father
!
I
know
what
the
new
doctor
said
to
you
about
me
...
I
saw
!
''
*NL*
cried
Ilusha
,
and
again
he
hugged
them
both
with
all
his
strength
,
hiding
*NL*
his
face
on
his
father
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
do
n't
cry
,
and
when
I
die
get
a
good
boy
,
another
one

choose
*NL*
one
of
them
all
,
a
good
one
,
call
him
Ilusha
and
love
him
instead
of
*NL*
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
old
man
,
you
'll
get
well
,
''
Krassotkin
cried
suddenly
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
that
sounded
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
ever
forget
me
,
father
,
''
Ilusha
went
on
,
``
come
to
my
grave
...
*NL*
and
,
father
,
bury
me
by
our
big
stone
,
where
we
used
to
go
for
our
walk
,
*NL*
and
come
to
me
there
with
Krassotkin
in
the
evening
...
and
Perezvon
...
I
*NL*
shall
expect
you
...
Father
,
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
broke
.
They
were
all
three
silent
,
still
embracing
.
Nina
was
*NL*
crying
quietly
in
her
chair
,
and
at
last
seeing
them
all
crying
,
``
mamma
,
''
*NL*
too
,
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
!
Ilusha
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Krassotkin
suddenly
released
himself
from
Ilusha
's
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
old
man
,
mother
expects
me
back
to
dinner
,
''
he
said
quickly
.
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
I
did
not
tell
her
!
She
will
be
dreadfully
anxious
...
But
*NL*
after
dinner
I
'll
come
back
to
you
for
the
whole
day
,
for
the
whole
*NL*
evening
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
sorts
of
things
,
all
sorts
of
things
.
And
*NL*
I
'll
bring
Perezvon
,
but
now
I
will
take
him
with
me
,
because
he
will
*NL*
begin
to
howl
when
I
am
away
and
bother
you
.
Good-by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
ran
out
into
the
passage
.
He
did
n't
want
to
cry
,
but
in
the
passage
*NL*
he
burst
into
tears
.
Alyosha
found
him
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kolya
,
you
must
be
sure
to
keep
your
word
and
come
,
or
he
will
be
*NL*
terribly
disappointed
,
''
Alyosha
said
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
!
Oh
,
how
I
curse
myself
for
not
having
come
before
!
''
muttered
*NL*
Kolya
,
crying
,
and
no
longer
ashamed
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
captain
flew
out
of
the
room
,
and
at
once
closed
the
*NL*
door
behind
him
.
His
face
looked
frenzied
,
his
lips
were
trembling
.
He
*NL*
stood
before
the
two
and
flung
up
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
a
good
boy
!
I
do
n't
want
another
boy
!
''
he
muttered
in
a
wild
*NL*
whisper
,
clenching
his
teeth
.
``
If
I
forget
thee
,
Jerusalem
,
may
my
*NL*
tongue
--
''
He
broke
off
with
a
sob
and
sank
on
his
knees
before
the
wooden
*NL*
bench
.
Pressing
his
fists
against
his
head
,
he
began
sobbing
with
absurd
*NL*
whimpering
cries
,
doing
his
utmost
that
his
cries
should
not
be
heard
in
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kolya
ran
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Karamazov
?
Will
you
come
yourself
?
''
he
cried
sharply
and
angrily
*NL*
to
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
certainly
come
in
the
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that
he
said
about
Jerusalem
?
...
What
did
he
mean
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
from
the
Bible
.
`
If
I
forget
thee
,
Jerusalem
,

that
is
,
if
I
forget
*NL*
all
that
is
most
precious
to
me
,
if
I
let
anything
take
its
place
,
then
*NL*
may
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
that
's
enough
!
Mind
you
come
!
_
Ici

,
Perezvon

''
he
cried
*NL*
with
positive
ferocity
to
the
dog
,
and
with
rapid
strides
he
went
home

Ivan
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I
.
At
Grushenka
's
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
towards
the
cathedral
square
to
the
widow
Morozov
's
house
to
*NL*
see
Grushenka
,
who
had
sent
Fenya
to
him
early
in
the
morning
with
an
*NL*
urgent
message
begging
him
to
come
.
Questioning
Fenya
,
Alyosha
learned
*NL*
that
her
mistress
had
been
particularly
distressed
since
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
During
the
two
months
that
had
passed
since
Mitya
's
arrest
,
Alyosha
had
*NL*
called
frequently
at
the
widow
Morozov
's
house
,
both
from
his
own
*NL*
inclination
and
to
take
messages
for
Mitya
.
Three
days
after
Mitya
's
*NL*
arrest
,
Grushenka
was
taken
very
ill
and
was
ill
for
nearly
five
weeks
.
*NL*
For
one
whole
week
she
was
unconscious
.
She
was
very
much
changed
--
thinner
*NL*
and
a
little
sallow
,
though
she
had
for
the
past
fortnight
been
well
*NL*
enough
to
go
out
.
But
to
Alyosha
her
face
was
even
more
attractive
than
*NL*
before
,
and
he
liked
to
meet
her
eyes
when
he
went
in
to
her
.
A
look
of
*NL*
firmness
and
intelligent
purpose
had
developed
in
her
face
.
There
were
*NL*
signs
of
a
spiritual
transformation
in
her
,
and
a
steadfast
,
fine
and
*NL*
humble
determination
that
nothing
could
shake
could
be
discerned
in
her
.
*NL*
There
was
a
small
vertical
line
between
her
brows
which
gave
her
charming
*NL*
face
a
look
of
concentrated
thought
,
almost
austere
at
the
first
glance
.
*NL*
There
was
scarcely
a
trace
of
her
former
frivolity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
strange
to
Alyosha
,
too
,
that
in
spite
of
the
calamity
that
had
*NL*
overtaken
the
poor
girl
,
betrothed
to
a
man
who
had
been
arrested
for
a
*NL*
terrible
crime
,
almost
at
the
instant
of
their
betrothal
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
illness
and
the
almost
inevitable
sentence
hanging
over
Mitya
,
Grushenka
*NL*
had
not
yet
lost
her
youthful
cheerfulness
.
There
was
a
soft
light
in
the
*NL*
once
proud
eyes
,
though
at
times
they
gleamed
with
the
old
vindictive
fire
*NL*
when
she
was
visited
by
one
disturbing
thought
stronger
than
ever
in
her
*NL*
heart
.
The
object
of
that
uneasiness
was
the
same
as
ever
--
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
of
whom
Grushenka
had
even
raved
when
she
lay
in
delirium
.
*NL*
Alyosha
knew
that
she
was
fearfully
jealous
of
her
.
Yet
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
had
not
once
visited
Mitya
in
his
prison
,
though
she
might
have
done
it
*NL*
whenever
she
liked
.
All
this
made
a
difficult
problem
for
Alyosha
,
for
he
*NL*
was
the
only
person
to
whom
Grushenka
opened
her
heart
and
from
whom
she
*NL*
was
continually
asking
advice
.
Sometimes
he
was
unable
to
say
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Full
of
anxiety
he
entered
her
lodging
.
She
was
at
home
.
She
had
returned
*NL*
from
seeing
Mitya
half
an
hour
before
,
and
from
the
rapid
movement
with
*NL*
which
she
leapt
up
from
her
chair
to
meet
him
he
saw
that
she
had
been
*NL*
expecting
him
with
great
impatience
.
A
pack
of
cards
dealt
for
a
game
of
*NL*
``
fools
''
lay
on
the
table
.
A
bed
had
been
made
up
on
the
leather
sofa
on
*NL*
the
other
side
and
Maximov
lay
,
half-reclining
,
on
it
.
He
wore
a
dressing
-
*NL*
gown
and
a
cotton
nightcap
,
and
was
evidently
ill
and
weak
,
though
he
was
*NL*
smiling
blissfully
.
When
the
homeless
old
man
returned
with
Grushenka
from
*NL*
Mokroe
two
months
before
,
he
had
simply
stayed
on
and
was
still
staying
*NL*
with
her
.
He
arrived
with
her
in
rain
and
sleet
,
sat
down
on
the
sofa
,
*NL*
drenched
and
scared
,
and
gazed
mutely
at
her
with
a
timid
,
appealing
*NL*
smile
.
Grushenka
,
who
was
in
terrible
grief
and
in
the
first
stage
of
*NL*
fever
,
almost
forgot
his
existence
in
all
she
had
to
do
the
first
half
-
*NL*
hour
after
her
arrival
.
Suddenly
she
chanced
to
look
at
him
intently
:
he
*NL*
laughed
a
pitiful
,
helpless
little
laugh
.
She
called
Fenya
and
told
her
to
*NL*
give
him
something
to
eat
.
All
that
day
he
sat
in
the
same
place
,
almost
*NL*
without
stirring
.
When
it
got
dark
and
the
shutters
were
closed
,
Fenya
*NL*
asked
her
mistress
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
gentleman
going
to
stay
the
night
,
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
make
him
a
bed
on
the
sofa
,
''
answered
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
Questioning
him
more
in
detail
,
Grushenka
learned
from
him
that
he
had
*NL*
literally
nowhere
to
go
,
and
that
``
Mr.
Kalganov
,
my
benefactor
,
told
me
*NL*
straight
that
he
would
n't
receive
me
again
and
gave
me
five
roubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
God
bless
you
,
you
'd
better
stay
,
then
,
''
Grushenka
decided
in
her
*NL*
grief
,
smiling
compassionately
at
him
.
Her
smile
wrung
the
old
man
's
heart
*NL*
and
his
lips
twitched
with
grateful
tears
.
And
so
the
destitute
wanderer
*NL*
had
stayed
with
her
ever
since
.
He
did
not
leave
the
house
even
when
she
*NL*
was
ill
.
Fenya
and
her
grandmother
,
the
cook
,
did
not
turn
him
out
,
but
*NL*
went
on
serving
him
meals
and
making
up
his
bed
on
the
sofa
.
Grushenka
had
*NL*
grown
used
to
him
,
and
coming
back
from
seeing
Mitya
-LRB-
whom
she
had
begun
*NL*
to
visit
in
prison
before
she
was
really
well
-RRB-
she
would
sit
down
and
*NL*
begin
talking
to
``
Maximushka
''
about
trifling
matters
,
to
keep
her
from
*NL*
thinking
of
her
sorrow
.
The
old
man
turned
out
to
be
a
good
story-teller
*NL*
on
occasions
,
so
that
at
last
he
became
necessary
to
her
.
Grushenka
saw
*NL*
scarcely
any
one
else
beside
Alyosha
,
who
did
not
come
every
day
and
never
*NL*
stayed
long
.
Her
old
merchant
lay
seriously
ill
at
this
time
,
``
at
his
last
*NL*
gasp
''
as
they
said
in
the
town
,
and
he
did
,
in
fact
,
die
a
week
after
*NL*
Mitya
's
trial
.
Three
weeks
before
his
death
,
feeling
the
end
approaching
,
*NL*
he
made
his
sons
,
their
wives
and
children
,
come
upstairs
to
him
at
last
*NL*
and
bade
them
not
leave
him
again
.
From
that
moment
he
gave
strict
orders
*NL*
to
his
servants
not
to
admit
Grushenka
and
to
tell
her
if
she
came
,
``
The
*NL*
master
wishes
you
long
life
and
happiness
and
tells
you
to
forget
him
.
''
*NL*
But
Grushenka
sent
almost
every
day
to
inquire
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
come
at
last
!
''
she
cried
,
flinging
down
the
cards
and
joyfully
*NL*
greeting
Alyosha
,
``
and
Maximushka
's
been
scaring
me
that
perhaps
you
*NL*
would
n't
come
.
Ah
,
how
I
need
you
!
Sit
down
to
the
table
.
What
will
you
*NL*
have
--
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
sitting
down
at
the
table
.
``
I
am
very
*NL*
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
.
Fenya
,
Fenya
,
coffee
,
''
cried
Grushenka
.
``
It
's
been
made
a
*NL*
long
time
ready
for
you
.
And
bring
some
little
pies
,
and
mind
they
are
*NL*
hot
.
Do
you
know
,
we
've
had
a
storm
over
those
pies
to-day
.
I
took
them
to
*NL*
the
prison
for
him
,
and
would
you
believe
it
,
he
threw
them
back
to
me
:
he
*NL*
would
not
eat
them
.
He
flung
one
of
them
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
.
*NL*
So
I
said
to
him
:
'
I
shall
leave
them
with
the
warder
;
if
you
do
n't
eat
*NL*
them
before
evening
,
it
will
be
that
your
venomous
spite
is
enough
for
*NL*
you
!
'
With
that
I
went
away
.
We
quarreled
again
,
would
you
believe
it
?
*NL*
Whenever
I
go
we
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
said
all
this
in
one
breath
in
her
agitation
.
Maximov
,
feeling
*NL*
nervous
,
at
once
smiled
and
looked
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
quarrel
about
this
time
?
''
asked
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
expect
it
in
the
least
.
Only
fancy
,
he
is
jealous
of
the
Pole
.
*NL*
`
Why
are
you
keeping
him
?
'
he
said
.
`
So
you
've
begun
keeping
him
.
'
He
is
*NL*
jealous
,
jealous
of
me
all
the
time
,
jealous
eating
and
sleeping
!
He
even
*NL*
took
it
into
his
head
to
be
jealous
of
Kuzma
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
knew
about
the
Pole
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
there
it
is
.
He
has
known
about
him
from
the
very
beginning
,
but
*NL*
to-day
he
suddenly
got
up
and
began
scolding
about
him
.
I
am
ashamed
to
*NL*
repeat
what
he
said
.
Silly
fellow
!
Rakitin
went
in
as
I
came
out
.
Perhaps
*NL*
Rakitin
is
egging
him
on
.
What
do
you
think
?
''
she
added
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
loves
you
,
that
's
what
it
is
:
he
loves
you
so
much
.
And
now
he
is
*NL*
particularly
worried
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
he
might
be
,
with
the
trial
to-morrow

And
I
went
to
him
*NL*
to
say
something
about
to-morrow
,
for
I
dread
to
think
what
's
going
to
*NL*
happen
then
.
You
say
that
he
is
worried
,
but
how
worried
I
am
!
And
he
*NL*
talks
about
the
Pole
!
He
's
too
silly
!
He
is
not
jealous
of
Maximushka
yet
,
*NL*
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
was
dreadfully
jealous
over
me
,
too

Maximov
put
in
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jealous
of
you
?
''
Grushenka
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
.
``
Of
whom
could
*NL*
she
have
been
jealous
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
servant
girls

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue

am
in
no

angry

not
good

I

I
have
to
look
after
him
,
too
,
just
as
*NL*
though
I
kept
an
almshouse
,
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
deserve
your
kindness
.
I
am
a
worthless
creature
,
''
said
Maximov
,
*NL*
with
tears
in
his
voice
.
``
You
would
do
better
to
spend
your
kindness
on
*NL*
people
of
more
use
than
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ech
,
every
one
is
of
use
,
Maximushka
,
and
how
can
we
tell
who
's
of
most
*NL*
use
?
If
only
that
Pole
did
n't
exist
,
Alyosha
.
He
's
taken
it
into
his
head
*NL*
to
fall
ill
,
too
,
to-day
.
I
've
been
to
see
him
also
.
And
I
shall
send
him
*NL*
some
pies
,
too
,
on
purpose
.
I
had
n't
sent
him
any
,
but
Mitya
accused
me
of
*NL*
it
,
so
now
I
shall
send
some
!
Ah
,
here
's
Fenya
with
a
letter
!
Yes
,
it
's
*NL*
from
the
Poles
--
begging
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pan
Mussyalovitch
had
indeed
sent
an
extremely
long
and
characteristically
*NL*
eloquent
letter
in
which
he
begged
her
to
lend
him
three
roubles
.
In
the
*NL*
letter
was
enclosed
a
receipt
for
the
sum
,
with
a
promise
to
repay
it
*NL*
within
three
months
,
signed
by
Pan
Vrublevsky
as
well
.
Grushenka
had
*NL*
received
many
such
letters
,
accompanied
by
such
receipts
,
from
her
former
*NL*
lover
during
the
fortnight
of
her
convalescence
.
But
she
knew
that
the
two
*NL*
Poles
had
been
to
ask
after
her
health
during
her
illness
.
The
first
*NL*
letter
Grushenka
got
from
them
was
a
long
one
,
written
on
large
notepaper
*NL*
and
with
a
big
family
crest
on
the
seal
.
It
was
so
obscure
and
rhetorical
*NL*
that
Grushenka
put
it
down
before
she
had
read
half
,
unable
to
make
head
*NL*
or
tail
of
it
.
She
could
not
attend
to
letters
then
.
The
first
letter
was
*NL*
followed
next
day
by
another
in
which
Pan
Mussyalovitch
begged
her
for
a
*NL*
loan
of
two
thousand
roubles
for
a
very
short
period
.
Grushenka
left
that
*NL*
letter
,
too
,
unanswered
.
A
whole
series
of
letters
had
followed
--
one
every
*NL*
day
--
all
as
pompous
and
rhetorical
,
but
the
loan
asked
for
,
gradually
*NL*
diminishing
,
dropped
to
a
hundred
roubles
,
then
to
twenty-five
,
to
ten
,
*NL*
and
finally
Grushenka
received
a
letter
in
which
both
the
Poles
begged
her
*NL*
for
only
one
rouble
and
included
a
receipt
signed
by
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Grushenka
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
them
,
and
at
dusk
she
went
round
*NL*
herself
to
their
lodging
.
She
found
the
two
Poles
in
great
poverty
,
almost
*NL*
destitution
,
without
food
or
fuel
,
without
cigarettes
,
in
debt
to
their
*NL*
landlady
.
The
two
hundred
roubles
they
had
carried
off
from
Mitya
at
*NL*
Mokroe
had
soon
disappeared
.
But
Grushenka
was
surprised
at
their
meeting
*NL*
her
with
arrogant
dignity
and
self-assertion
,
with
the
greatest
punctilio
*NL*
and
pompous
speeches
.
Grushenka
simply
laughed
,
and
gave
her
former
*NL*
admirer
ten
roubles
.
Then
,
laughing
,
she
told
Mitya
of
it
and
he
was
not
*NL*
in
the
least
jealous
.
But
ever
since
,
the
Poles
had
attached
themselves
to
*NL*
Grushenka
and
bombarded
her
daily
with
requests
for
money
and
she
had
*NL*
always
sent
them
small
sums
.
And
now
that
day
Mitya
had
taken
it
into
his
*NL*
head
to
be
fearfully
jealous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
a
fool
,
I
went
round
to
him
just
for
a
minute
,
on
the
way
to
see
*NL*
Mitya
,
for
he
is
ill
,
too
,
my
Pole
,
''
Grushenka
began
again
with
nervous
*NL*
haste
.
``
I
was
laughing
,
telling
Mitya
about
it
.
`
Fancy
,
'
I
said
,
`
my
Pole
*NL*
had
the
happy
thought
to
sing
his
old
songs
to
me
to
the
guitar
.
He
*NL*
thought
I
would
be
touched
and
marry
him
!
'
Mitya
leapt
up
swearing
...
So
,
*NL*
there
,
I
'll
send
them
the
pies
!
Fenya
,
is
it
that
little
girl
they
've
*NL*
sent
?
Here
,
give
her
three
roubles
and
pack
a
dozen
pies
up
in
a
paper
and
*NL*
tell
her
to
take
them
.
And
you
,
Alyosha
,
be
sure
to
tell
Mitya
that
I
did
*NL*
send
them
the
pies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
tell
him
for
anything
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ech
!
You
think
he
is
unhappy
about
it
.
Why
,
he
's
jealous
on
purpose
.
He
*NL*
does
n't
care
,
''
said
Grushenka
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
purpose
?
''
queried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
you
are
silly
,
Alyosha
.
You
know
nothing
about
it
,
with
all
*NL*
your
cleverness
.
I
am
not
offended
that
he
is
jealous
of
a
girl
like
me
.
I
*NL*
would
be
offended
if
he
were
not
jealous
.
I
am
like
that
.
I
am
not
*NL*
offended
at
jealousy
.
I
have
a
fierce
heart
,
too
.
I
can
be
jealous
myself
.
*NL*
Only
what
offends
me
is
that
he
does
n't
love
me
at
all
.
I
tell
you
he
is
*NL*
jealous
now
_
on
purpose
_
.
Am
I
blind
?
Do
n't
I
see
?
He
began
talking
to
me
*NL*
just
now
of
that
woman
,
of
Katerina
,
saying
she
was
this
and
that
,
how
she
*NL*
had
ordered
a
doctor
from
Moscow
for
him
,
to
try
and
save
him
;
how
she
had
*NL*
ordered
the
best
counsel
,
the
most
learned
one
,
too
.
So
he
loves
her
,
if
*NL*
he
'll
praise
her
to
my
face
,
more
shame
to
him
!
He
's
treated
me
badly
*NL*
himself
,
so
he
attacked
me
,
to
make
out
I
am
in
fault
first
and
to
throw
*NL*
it
all
on
me
.
`
You
were
with
your
Pole
before
me
,
so
I
ca
n't
be
blamed
for
*NL*
Katerina
,
'
that
's
what
it
amounts
to
.
He
wants
to
throw
the
whole
blame
on
*NL*
me
.
He
attacked
me
on
purpose
,
on
purpose
,
I
tell
you
,
but
I
'll

''
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
could
not
finish
saying
what
she
would
do
.
She
hid
her
eyes
in
*NL*
her
handkerchief
and
sobbed
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
love
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
''
said
Alyosha
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whether
he
loves
her
or
not
,
I
'll
soon
find
out
for
myself

said
*NL*
Grushenka
,
with
a
menacing
note
in
her
voice
,
taking
the
handkerchief
from
*NL*
her
eyes
.
Her
face
was
distorted
.
Alyosha
saw
sorrowfully
that
from
being
*NL*
mild
and
serene
,
it
had
become
sullen
and
spiteful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
of
this
foolishness
,
''
she
said
suddenly
;
``
it
's
not
for
that
I
sent
*NL*
for
you

to-morrow

happen
to-morrow

That

of
the

will
no

stand
up

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
severely
cross-examined

observed
Alyosha
thoughtfully
;
``

every
one
came
to
the
conclusion

not
he

is
lying
very
ill

has
been
ill

attack

added
Alyosha
.

``
Oh

dear

could

counsel
yourself

yourself

been
brought
from
Petersburg
for
three
thousand
*NL*
roubles

*NL*
*NL*

We
gave
these
three
thousand
together

Ivan

Katerina
Ivanovna

she
paid
two
thousand
for
the
doctor
from
Moscow
herself

The
counsel

Fetyukovitch
would
have
charged
more

the
case
has
become
known
all
*NL*
over
Russia

it
's
talked
of

all

papers

journals

Fetyukovitch

agreed
to
come
more
for

glory

notorious

him
yesterday

*NL*
``
Well

you
talk
to
him

Grushenka
put
in
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
listened
and
said
nothing

He
told
me
that

already
formed

give

*NL*
``

``

gently

's
*NL*
always
talking
about
?
He
talks
and
talks
and
I
can
make
nothing
of
it
.
I
*NL*
fancied
he
was
talking
of
something
intellectual
that
I
could
n't
*NL*
understand
in
my
foolishness
.
Only
he
suddenly
began
talking
to
me
about
a
*NL*
babe
--
that
is
,
about
some
child
.
`
Why
is
the
babe
poor
?
'
he
said
.
`
It
's
for
*NL*
that
babe
I
am
going
to
Siberia
now
.
I
am
not
a
murderer
,
but
I
must
go
to
*NL*
Siberia
!
'
What
that
meant
,
what
babe
,
I
could
n't
tell
for
the
life
of
me
.
*NL*
Only
I
cried
when
he
said
it
,
because
he
said
it
so
nicely
.
He
cried
*NL*
himself
,
and
I
cried
,
too
.
He
suddenly
kissed
me
and
made
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
cross
over
me
.
What
did
it
mean
,
Alyosha
,
tell
me
?
What
is
this
babe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
Rakitin
,
who
's
been
going
to
see
him
lately
,
''
smiled
Alyosha
,
*NL*
``
though
...
that
's
not
Rakitin
's
doing
.
I
did
n't
see
Mitya
yesterday
.
I
'll
*NL*
see
him
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
Rakitin
;
it
's
his
brother
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
upsetting
him
.
*NL*
It
's
his
going
to
see
him
,
that
's
what
it
is
,
''
Grushenka
began
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
broke
off
.
Alyosha
gazed
at
her
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
's
going
?
Has
he
been
to
see
him
?
Mitya
told
me
himself
that
Ivan
*NL*
has
n't
been
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
...
there
!
What
a
girl
I
am
!
Blurting
things
out
!
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Grushenka
,
confused
and
suddenly
blushing
.
``
Stay
,
Alyosha
,
hush
!
Since
*NL*
I
've
said
so
much
I
'll
tell
the
whole
truth
--
he
's
been
to
see
him
twice
,
*NL*
the
first
directly
he
arrived
.
He
galloped
here
from
Moscow
at
once
,
of
*NL*
course
,
before
I
was
taken
ill
;
and
the
second
time
was
a
week
ago
.
He
*NL*
told
Mitya
not
to
tell
you
about
it
,
under
any
circumstances
;
and
not
to
*NL*
tell
any
one
,
in
fact
.
He
came
secretly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
sat
plunged
in
thought
,
considering
something
.
The
news
evidently
*NL*
impressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
does
n't
talk
to
me
of
Mitya
's
case
,
''
he
said
slowly
.
``
He
's
said
very
*NL*
little
to
me
these
last
two
months
.
And
whenever
I
go
to
see
him
,
he
seems
*NL*
vexed
at
my
coming
,
so
I
've
not
been
to
him
for
the
last
three
weeks
.
*NL*
H
'm
!
...
if
he
was
there
a
week
ago
...
there
certainly
has
been
a
change
*NL*
in
Mitya
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
a
change
,
''
Grushenka
assented
quickly
.
``
They
have
a
*NL*
secret
,
they
have
a
secret
!
Mitya
told
me
himself
there
was
a
secret
,
and
*NL*
such
a
secret
that
Mitya
ca
n't
rest
.
Before
then
,
he
was
cheerful
--
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
he
is
cheerful
now
--
but
when
he
shakes
his
head
like
that
,
you
*NL*
know
,
and
strides
about
the
room
and
keeps
pulling
at
the
hair
on
his
*NL*
right
temple
with
his
right
hand
,
I
know
there
is
something
on
his
mind
*NL*
worrying
him
...
I
know
!
He
was
cheerful
before
,
though
,
indeed
,
he
is
*NL*
cheerful
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
he
was
worried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
worried
and
yet
cheerful
.
He
keeps
on
being
irritable
for
a
*NL*
minute
and
then
cheerful
and
then
irritable
again
.
And
you
know
,
Alyosha
,
*NL*
I
am
constantly
wondering
at
him
--
with
this
awful
thing
hanging
over
him
,
*NL*
he
sometimes
laughs
at
such
trifles
as
though
he
were
a
baby
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
really
tell
you
not
to
tell
me
about
Ivan
?
Did
he
say
,
`
Do
n't
*NL*
tell
him
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
told
me
,
`
Do
n't
tell
him

'
It
's
you
that
Mitya
's
most
afraid
of
.
*NL*
Because
it
's
a
secret
:
he
said
himself
it
was
a
secret
.
Alyosha
,
darling
,
*NL*
go
to
him
and
find
out
what
their
secret
is
and
come
and
tell
me
,
''
*NL*
Grushenka
besought
him
with
sudden
eagerness
.
``
Set
my
mind
at
rest
that
I
*NL*
may
know
the
worst
that
's
in
store
for

That
's
why
I
sent
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
it
's
something
to
do
with
you

If
it
were
,
he
would

have
*NL*
told
you
there
was
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Perhaps
he
wants
to
tell
me
,
but
does
n't
dare
to
.
He
warns
*NL*
me
.
There
is
a
secret
,
he
tells
me
,
but
he
wo
n't
tell
me
what
it
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
think
?
It
's
the
end
for
me
,
that
's
what
I
think
.
They
all
three
*NL*
have
been
plotting
my
end
,
for
Katerina

in
it
.
It
's
all
Katerina
,
it
all
*NL*
comes
from
her
.
She
is
this
and
that
,
and
that
means
that
I
am
not
.
He
*NL*
tells
me
that
beforehand
--
warns
me
.
He
is
planning
to
throw
me
over
,
that
's
*NL*
the
whole
secret

They
've
planned
it
together
,
the
three
of
them
--
Mitya
,
*NL*
Katerina
,
and
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
.
Alyosha
,
I
've
been
wanting
to
ask
you
a
*NL*
long
time
.
A
week
ago
he
suddenly
told
me
that
Ivan
was
in
love
with
*NL*
Katerina
,
because
he
often
goes
to
see
her
.
Did
he
tell
me
the
truth
or
*NL*
not
?
Tell
me
,
on
your
conscience
,
tell
me
the
worst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
tell
you
a
lie
.
Ivan
is
not
in
love
with
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
what
I
thought
!
He
is
lying
to
me
,
shameless
deceiver
,
that
's
*NL*
what
it
is
!
And
he
was
jealous
of
me
just
now
,
so
as
to
put
the
blame
on
*NL*
me
afterwards
.
He
is
stupid
,
he
ca
n't
disguise
what
he
is
doing
;
he
is
so
*NL*
open
,
you
know
...
But
I
'll
give
it
to
him
,
I
'll
give
it
to
him
!
`
You
*NL*
believe
I
did
it
,
'
he
said
.
He
said
that
to
me
,
to
me
.
He
reproached
me
*NL*
with
that
!
God
forgive
him
!
You
wait
,
I
'll
make
it
hot
for
Katerina
at
the
*NL*
trial
!
I
'll
just
say
a
word
then
...
I
'll
tell
everything
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
she
cried
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
I
can
tell
you
for
certain
,
Grushenka
,
''
Alyosha
said
,
getting
up
.
*NL*
``
First
,
that
he
loves
you
,
loves
you
more
than
any
one
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
you
only
,
believe
me
.
I
know
.
I
do
know
.
The
second
thing
is
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
worm
his
secret
out
of
him
,
but
if
he
'll
tell
me
of
himself
to
-
*NL*
day
,
I
shall
tell
him
straight
out
that
I
have
promised
to
tell
you
.
Then
*NL*
I
'll
come
to
you
to-day
,
and
tell
you
.
Only
...
I
fancy
...
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
and
that
the
secret
is
about
something
*NL*
else
.
That
's
certain
.
It
is
n't
likely
it
's
about
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
.
Good-by
for
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
shook
hands
with
her
.
Grushenka
was
still
crying
.
He
saw
that
she
*NL*
put
little
faith
in
his
consolation
,
but
she
was
better
for
having
had
her
*NL*
sorrow
out
,
for
having
spoken
of
it
.
He
was
sorry
to
leave
her
in
such
a
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
but
he
was
in
haste
.
He
had
a
great
many
things
to
do
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
II
.
The
Injured
Foot
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
these
things
was
at
the
house
of
Madame
Hohlakov
,
and
he
*NL*
hurried
there
to
get
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible
and
not
be
too
late
*NL*
for
Mitya
.
Madame
Hohlakov
had
been
slightly
ailing
for
the
last
three
*NL*
weeks
:
her
foot
had
for
some
reason
swollen
up
,
and
though
she
was
not
in
*NL*
bed
,
she
lay
all
day
half-reclining
on
the
couch
in
her
boudoir
,
in
a
*NL*
fascinating
but
decorous
_
deshabille
_
.
Alyosha
had
once
noted
with
*NL*
innocent
amusement
that
,
in
spite
of
her
illness
,
Madame
Hohlakov
had
*NL*
begun
to
be
rather
dressy
--
top-knots
,
ribbons
,
loose
wrappers
,
had
made
*NL*
their
appearance
,
and
he
had
an
inkling
of
the
reason
,
though
he
dismissed
*NL*
such
ideas
from
his
mind
as
frivolous
.
During
the
last
two
months
the
*NL*
young
official
,
Perhotin
,
had
become
a
regular
visitor
at
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
had
not
called
for
four
days
and
he
was
in
haste
to
go
straight
to
*NL*
Lise
,
as
it
was
with
her
he
had
to
speak
,
for
Lise
had
sent
a
maid
to
him
*NL*
the
previous
day
,
specially
asking
him
to
come
to
her
``
about
something
*NL*
very
important
,
''
a
request
which
,
for
certain
reasons
,
had
interest
for
*NL*
Alyosha
.
But
while
the
maid
went
to
take
his
name
in
to
Lise
,
Madame
*NL*
Hohlakov
heard
of
his
arrival
from
some
one
,
and
immediately
sent
to
beg
*NL*
him
to
come
to
her
``
just
for
one
minute
.
''
Alyosha
reflected
that
it
was
*NL*
better
to
accede
to
the
mamma
's
request
,
or
else
she
would
be
sending
down
*NL*
to
Lise
's
room
every
minute
that
he
was
there
.
Madame
Hohlakov
was
lying
*NL*
on
a
couch
.
She
was
particularly
smartly
dressed
and
was
evidently
in
a
*NL*
state
of
extreme
nervous
excitement
.
She
greeted
Alyosha
with
cries
of
*NL*
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ages

ages
,
perfect
ages
since
I

It

only
*NL*
think
of
it

Ah
,
but
you
were
here
only
four
days
ago
,
on
Wednesday
.
You
*NL*
have
come
to
see
Lise

I
'm
sure
you
meant
to
slip
into
her
room
on
tiptoe
,
*NL*
without
my
hearing
you

dear

dear
Alexey
Fyodorovitch

worried
I
am

the
most

important

that
later

Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
I
trust
you
*NL*
implicitly
with
my
Lise

death

Zossima

soul

-LRB-
she
crossed
herself

``
I
look
upon
you
as

you
look

charming

find
such
a
tailor
in
these
*NL*
parts
?
No

no

that
's
not
the
chief
thing

of
that
later
.
Forgive
me
for
*NL*
sometimes
calling
you

old
woman

take
liberties

*NL*
she
smiled
coquettishly
;
``

that
will
do
later

too

important

I

took
back
her
promise

her
childish
promise
,
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
--
to
marry
you
,
you
've
realized
,
of
course
,
that
it
was
only
*NL*
the
playful
fancy
of
a
sick
child
who
had
been
so
long
confined
to
her
*NL*
chair
--
thank
God
,
she
can
walk
now
!
...
that
new
doctor
Katya
sent
for
from
*NL*
Moscow
for
your
unhappy
brother
,
who
will
to-morrow
--
But
why
speak
of
to

*NL*
morrow
?
I
am
ready
to
die
at
the
very
thought
of
to-morrow
.
Ready
to
die
*NL*
of
curiosity
...
That
doctor
was
with
us
yesterday
and
saw
Lise
...
I
paid
*NL*
him
fifty
roubles
for
the
visit
.
But
that
's
not
the
point
,
that
's
not
the
*NL*
point
again

You
see
,
I
'm
mixing
everything
up

I
am
in
such
a
hurry

Why
*NL*
am
I
in
a
hurry
?
I
do
n't
understand

It
's
awful
how
I
seem
growing
unable
*NL*
to
understand
anything

Everything
seems
mixed
up
in
a
sort
of
tangle

I
*NL*
am
afraid
you
are
so
bored
you
will
jump
up

run
away

that
will
be

*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
made
haste
to
thank
her

and
said
that
he
had
only
just
had

coffee

shall
tell
you
nothing
.
This
awful
trial
...
I
shall
*NL*
certainly
go
,
I
am
making
arrangements
.
I
shall
be
carried
there
in
my
*NL*
chair
;
besides
I
can
sit
up
.
I
shall
have
people
with
me
.
And
,
you
know
,
I
*NL*
am
a
witness
.
How
shall
I
speak
,
how
shall
I
speak
?
I
do
n't
know
what
I
*NL*
shall
say
.
One
has
to
take
an
oath
,
has
n't
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
do
n't
think
you
will
be
able
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
sit
up
.
Ah
,
you
put
me
out
!
Ah
!
this
trial
,
this
savage
act
,
and
*NL*
then
they
are
all
going
to
Siberia
,
some
are
getting
married
,
and
all
this
*NL*
so
quickly
,
so
quickly
,
everything
's
changing
,
and
at
last
--
nothing
.
All
*NL*
grow
old
and
have
death
to
look
forward
to
.
Well
,
so
be
it
!
I
am
weary
.
*NL*
This
Katya
,
_
cette
charmante
personne
_
,
has
disappointed
all
my
hopes
.
Now
*NL*
she
is
going
to
follow
one
of
your
brothers
to
Siberia
,
and
your
other
*NL*
brother
is
going
to
follow
her
,
and
will
live
in
the
nearest
town
,
and
*NL*
they
will
all
torment
one
another
.
It
drives
me
out
of
my
mind
.
Worst
of
*NL*
all
--
the
publicity
.
The
story
has
been
told
a
million
times
over
in
all
the
*NL*
papers
in
Moscow
and
Petersburg
.
Ah
!
yes
,
would
you
believe
it
,
there
's
a
*NL*
paragraph
that
I
was
'
a
dear
friend
'
of
your
brother
's
--
,
I
ca
n't
repeat
*NL*
the
horrid
word
.
Just
fancy
,
just
fancy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
Where
was
the
paragraph
?
What
did
it
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
you
directly
.
I
got
the
paper
and
read
it
yesterday
.
Here
,
in
*NL*
the
Petersburg
paper
_
Gossip
_
.
The
paper
began
coming
out
this
year
.
I
am
*NL*
awfully
fond
of
gossip
,
and
I
take
it
in
,
and
now
it
pays
me
out
--
this
is
*NL*
what
gossip
comes
to
!
Here
it
is
,
here
,
this
passage
.
Read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
handed
Alyosha
a
sheet
of
newspaper
which
had
been
under
her
*NL*
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
exactly
that
she
was
upset
,
she
seemed
overwhelmed
and
perhaps
*NL*
everything
really
was
mixed
up
in
a
tangle
in
her
head
.
The
paragraph
was
*NL*
very
typical
,
and
must
have
been
a
great
shock
to
her
,
but
,
fortunately
*NL*
perhaps
,
she
was
unable
to
keep
her
mind
fixed
on
any
one
subject
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
and
so
might
race
off
in
a
minute
to
something
else
and
quite
*NL*
forget
the
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
was
well
aware
that
the
story
of
the
terrible
case
had
spread
all
*NL*
over
Russia
.
And
,
good
heavens
!
what
wild
rumors
about
his
brother
,
about
*NL*
the
Karamazovs
,
and
about
himself
he
had
read
in
the
course
of
those
two
*NL*
months
,
among
other
equally
credible
items
!
One
paper
had
even
stated
that
*NL*
he
had
gone
into
a
monastery
and
become
a
monk
,
in
horror
at
his
brother
's
*NL*
crime
.
Another
contradicted
this
,
and
stated
that
he
and
his
elder
,
Father
*NL*
Zossima
,
had
broken
into
the
monastery
chest
and
``
made
tracks
from
the
*NL*
monastery
.
''
The
present
paragraph
in
the
paper
_
Gossip
_
was
under
the
*NL*
heading
,
``
The
Karamazov
Case
at
Skotoprigonyevsk
.
''
-LRB-
That
,
alas
!
was
the
*NL*
name
of
our
little
town
.
I
had
hitherto
kept
it
concealed
.
-RRB-
It
was
brief
,
*NL*
and
Madame
Hohlakov
was
not
directly
mentioned
in
it
.
No
names
appeared
,
*NL*
in
fact
.
It
was
merely
stated
that
the
criminal
,
whose
approaching
trial
*NL*
was
making
such
a
sensation
--
retired
army
captain
,
an
idle
swaggerer
,
and
*NL*
reactionary
bully
--
was
continually
involved
in
amorous
intrigues
,
and
*NL*
particularly
popular
with
certain
ladies
``
who
were
pining
in
solitude
.
''
*NL*
One
such
lady
,
a
pining
widow
,
who
tried
to
seem
young
though
she
had
a
*NL*
grown-up
daughter
,
was
so
fascinated
by
him
that
only
two
hours
before
the
*NL*
crime
she
offered
him
three
thousand
roubles
,
on
condition
that
he
would
*NL*
elope
with
her
to
the
gold
mines
.
But
the
criminal
,
counting
on
escaping
*NL*
punishment
,
had
preferred
to
murder
his
father
to
get
the
three
thousand
*NL*
rather
than
go
off
to
Siberia
with
the
middle-aged
charms
of
his
pining
*NL*
lady
.
This
playful
paragraph
finished
,
of
course
,
with
an
outburst
of
*NL*
generous
indignation
at
the
wickedness
of
parricide
and
at
the
lately
*NL*
abolished
institution
of
serfdom
.
Reading
it
with
curiosity
,
Alyosha
*NL*
folded
up
the
paper
and
handed
it
back
to
Madame
Hohlakov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
must
be
me
,
''
she
hurried
on
again
.
``
Of
course
I
am
meant
.
*NL*
Scarcely
more
than
an
hour
before
,
I
suggested
gold
mines
to
him
,
and
here
*NL*
they
talk
of
`
middle-aged
charms
'
as
though
that
were
my
motive
!
He
writes
*NL*
that
out
of
spite
!
God
Almighty
forgive
him
for
the
middle-aged
charms
,
as
*NL*
I
forgive
him
!
You
know
it
's
--
Do
you
know
who
it
is
?
It
's
your
friend
*NL*
Rakitin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
``
though
I
've
heard
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
he
,
it
's
he
!
No
`
perhaps
'
about
it
.
You
know
I
turned
him
out
of
the
*NL*
house
...
You
know
all
that
story
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
you
asked
him
not
to
visit
you
for
the
future
,
but
why
it
*NL*
was
,
I
have
n't
heard
...
from
you
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
you
've
heard
it
from
him
!
He
abuses
me
,
I
suppose
,
abuses
me
*NL*
dreadfully
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
does
;
but
then
he
abuses
every
one
.
But
why
you
've
given
him
up
I
*NL*
have
n't
heard
from
him
either
.
I
meet
him
very
seldom
now
,
indeed
.
We
are
*NL*
not
friends

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
.
There
's
no
help
for
it
,
I
'll
*NL*
confess
,
for
there
is
one
point
in
which
I
was
perhaps
to
blame
.
Only
a
*NL*
little
,
little
point
,
so
little
that
perhaps
it
does
n't
count
.
You
see
,
my
*NL*
dear
boy
''
--
Madame
Hohlakov
suddenly
looked
arch
and
a
charming
,
though
*NL*
enigmatic
,
smile
played
about
her
lips
--
``
you
see
,
I
suspect
...
You
must
*NL*
forgive
me
,
Alyosha
.
I
am
like
a
mother
to
you
...
No
,
no
;
quite
the
*NL*
contrary
.
I
speak
to
you
now
as
though
you
were
my
father
--
mother
's
quite
*NL*
out
of
place
.
Well
,
it
's
as
though
I
were
confessing
to
Father
Zossima
,
*NL*
that
's
just
it
.
I
called
you
a
monk
just
now
.
Well
,
that
poor
young
man
,
*NL*
your
friend
,
Rakitin
-LRB-
Mercy
on
us
!
I
ca
n't
be
angry
with
him
.
I
feel
*NL*
cross
,
but
not
very
-RRB-
,
that
frivolous
young
man
,
would
you
believe
it
,
*NL*
seems
to
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
fall
in
love
with
me
.
I
only
*NL*
noticed
it
later
.
At
first
--
a
month
ago
--
he
only
began
to
come
oftener
to
*NL*
see
me
,
almost
every
day
;
though
,
of
course
,
we
were
acquainted
before
.
I
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
it
...
and
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
me
,
and
I
began
to
*NL*
notice
things
with
surprise
.
You
know
,
two
months
ago
,
that
modest
,
*NL*
charming
,
excellent
young
man
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
Perhotin
,
who
's
in
the
*NL*
service
here
,
began
to
be
a
regular
visitor
at
the
house
.
You
met
him
here
*NL*
ever
so
many
times
yourself
.
And
he
is
an
excellent
,
earnest
young
man
,
*NL*
is
n't
he
?
He
comes
once
every
three
days
,
not
every
day
-LRB-
though
I
should
*NL*
be
glad
to
see
him
every
day
-RRB-
,
and
always
so
well
dressed
.
Altogether
,
I
*NL*
love
young
people
,
Alyosha
,
talented
,
modest
,
like
you
,
and
he
has
almost
*NL*
the
mind
of
a
statesman
,
he
talks
so
charmingly
,
and
I
shall
certainly
,
*NL*
certainly
try
and
get
promotion
for
him
.
He
is
a
future
diplomat
.
On
that
*NL*
awful
day
he
almost
saved
me
from
death
by
coming
in
the
night
.
And
your
*NL*
friend
Rakitin
comes
in
such
boots
,
and
always
stretches
them
out
on
the
*NL*
carpet
...
He
began
hinting
at
his
feelings
,
in
fact
,
and
one
day
,
as
he
*NL*
was
going
,
he
squeezed
my
hand
terribly
hard
.
My
foot
began
to
swell
*NL*
directly
after
he
pressed
my
hand
like
that
.
He
had
met
Pyotr
Ilyitch
here
*NL*
before
,
and
would
you
believe
it
,
he
is
always
gibing
at
him
,
growling
at
*NL*
him
,
for
some
reason
.
I
simply
looked
at
the
way
they
went
on
together
and
*NL*
laughed
inwardly
.
So
I
was
sitting
here
alone
--
no
,
I
was
laid
up
then
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
was
lying
here
alone
and
suddenly
Rakitin
comes
in
,
and
only
*NL*
fancy
!
brought
me
some
verses
of
his
own
composition
--
a
short
poem
,
on
my
*NL*
bad
foot
:
that
is
,
he
described
my
foot
in
a
poem
.
Wait
a
minute
--
how
did
*NL*
it
go
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
captivating
little
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
somehow
like
that
.
I
can
never
remember
poetry
.
I
've
got
it
here
.
*NL*
I
'll
show
it
to
you
later
.
But
it
's
a
charming
thing
--
charming
;
and
,
you
*NL*
know
,
it
's
not
only
about
the
foot
,
it
had
a
good
moral
,
too
,
a
charming
*NL*
idea
,
only
I
've
forgotten
it
;
in
fact
,
it
was
just
the
thing
for
an
album
.
*NL*
So
,
of
course
,
I
thanked
him
,
and
he
was
evidently
flattered
.
I
'd
hardly
*NL*
had
time
to
thank
him
when
in
comes
Pyotr
Ilyitch
,
and
Rakitin
suddenly
*NL*
looked
as
black
as
night
.
I
could
see
that
Pyotr
Ilyitch
was
in
the
way
,
*NL*
for
Rakitin
certainly
wanted
to
say
something
after
giving
me
the
verses
.
*NL*
I
had
a
presentiment
of
it
;
but
Pyotr
Ilyitch
came
in
.
I
showed
Pyotr
*NL*
Ilyitch
the
verses
and
did
n't
say
who
was
the
author
.
But
I
am
convinced
*NL*
that
he
guessed
,
though
he
wo
n't
own
it
to
this
day
,
and
declares
he
had
*NL*
no
idea
.
But
he
says
that
on
purpose
.
Pyotr
Ilyitch
began
to
laugh
at
*NL*
once
,
and
fell
to
criticizing
it
.
`
Wretched
doggerel
,
'
he
said
they
were
,
*NL*
`
some
divinity
student
must
have
written
them
,
'
and
with
such
vehemence
,
*NL*
such
vehemence
!
Then
,
instead
of
laughing
,
your
friend
flew
into
a
rage
.
*NL*
`
Good
gracious
!
'
I
thought
,
`
they
'll
fly
at
each
other
.
'
`
It
was
I
who
*NL*
wrote
them
,
'
said
he
.
'
I
wrote
them
as
a
joke
,
'
he
said
,
`
for
I
think
it
*NL*
degrading
to
write
verses
...
But
they
are
good
poetry
.
They
want
to
put
a
*NL*
monument
to
your
Pushkin
for
writing
about
women
's
feet
,
while
I
wrote
*NL*
with
a
moral
purpose
,
and
you
,
'
said
he
,
`
are
an
advocate
of
serfdom
.
*NL*
You
've
no
humane
ideas
,
'
said
he
.
`
You
have
no
modern
enlightened
*NL*
feelings
,
you
are
uninfluenced
by
progress
,
you
are
a
mere
official
,
'
he
*NL*
said
,
`
and
you
take
bribes
.
'
Then
I
began
screaming
and
imploring
them
.
*NL*
And
,
you
know
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch
is
anything
but
a
coward
.
He
at
once
took
up
*NL*
the
most
gentlemanly
tone
,
looked
at
him
sarcastically
,
listened
,
and
*NL*
apologized
.
`
I
'd
no
idea
,
'
said
he
.
'
I
should
n't
have
said
it
,
if
I
had
*NL*
known
.
I
should
have
praised
it
.
Poets
are
all
so
irritable
,
'
he
said
.
In
*NL*
short
,
he
laughed
at
him
under
cover
of
the
most
gentlemanly
tone
.
He
*NL*
explained
to
me
afterwards
that
it
was
all
sarcastic
.
I
thought
he
was
in
*NL*
earnest
.
Only
as
I
lay
there
,
just
as
before
you
now
,
I
thought
,
`
Would
*NL*
it
,
or
would
it
not
,
be
the
proper
thing
for
me
to
turn
Rakitin
out
for
*NL*
shouting
so
rudely
at
a
visitor
in
my
house
?
'
And
,
would
you
believe
it
,
I
*NL*
lay
here
,
shut
my
eyes
,
and
wondered
,
would
it
be
the
proper
thing
or
not
.
*NL*
I
kept
worrying
and
worrying
,
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
,
and
I
could
n't
*NL*
make
up
my
mind
whether
to
make
an
outcry
or
not
.
One
voice
seemed
to
be
*NL*
telling
me
,
`
Speak
,
'
and
the
other
`
No
,
do
n't
speak
.
'
And
no
sooner
had
*NL*
the
second
voice
said
that
than
I
cried
out
,
and
fainted
.
Of
course
,
there
*NL*
was
a
fuss
.
I
got
up
suddenly
and
said
to
Rakitin
,
`
It
's
painful
for
me
to
*NL*
say
it
,
but
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
you
in
my
house
again
.
'
So
I
turned
him
*NL*
out
.
Ah
!
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
I
know
myself
I
did
wrong
.
I
was
putting
it
*NL*
on
.
I
was
n't
angry
with
him
at
all
,
really
;
but
I
suddenly
fancied
--
that
*NL*
was
what
did
it
--
that
it
would
be
such
a
fine
scene
...
And
yet
,
believe
*NL*
me
,
it
was
quite
natural
,
for
I
really
shed
tears
and
cried
for
several
*NL*
days
afterwards
,
and
then
suddenly
,
one
afternoon
,
I
forgot
all
about
it
.
*NL*
So
it
's
a
fortnight
since
he
's
been
here
,
and
I
kept
wondering
whether
he
*NL*
would
come
again
.
I
wondered
even
yesterday
,
then
suddenly
last
night
came
*NL*
this
_
Gossip
_
.
I
read
it
and
gasped
.
Who
could
have
written
it
?
He
must
*NL*
have
written
it
.
He
went
home
,
sat
down
,
wrote
it
on
the
spot
,
sent
it
,
*NL*
and
they
put
it
in
.
It
was
a
fortnight
ago
,
you
see
.
But
,
Alyosha
,
it
's
*NL*
awful
how
I
keep
talking
and
do
n't
say
what
I
want
to
say
.
Ah
!
the
words
*NL*
come
of
themselves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
important
for
me
to
be
in
time
to
see
my
brother
to-day
,
''
*NL*
Alyosha
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
!
You
bring
it
all
back
to
me
.
Listen
,
what
is
an
*NL*
aberration
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
aberration
?
''
asked
Alyosha
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
legal
sense
.
An
aberration
in
which
everything
is
pardonable
.
*NL*
Whatever
you
do
,
you
will
be
acquitted
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
This
Katya
...
Ah
!
she
is
a
charming
,
charming
creature
,
*NL*
only
I
never
can
make
out
who
it
is
she
is
in
love
with
.
She
was
with
me
*NL*
some
time
ago
and
I
could
n't
get
anything
out
of
her
.
Especially
as
she
*NL*
wo
n't
talk
to
me
except
on
the
surface
now
.
She
is
always
talking
about
my
*NL*
health
and
nothing
else
,
and
she
takes
up
such
a
tone
with
me
,
too
.
I
*NL*
simply
said
to
myself
,
`
Well
,
so
be
it
.
I
do
n't
care
'
...
Oh
,
yes
.
I
was
*NL*
talking
of
aberration
.
This
doctor
has
come
.
You
know
a
doctor
has
come
?
*NL*
Of
course
,
you
know
it
--
the
one
who
discovers
madmen
.
You
wrote
for
him
.
*NL*
No
,
it
was
n't
you
,
but
Katya
.
It
's
all
Katya
's
doing
.
Well
,
you
see
,
a
man
*NL*
may
be
sitting
perfectly
sane
and
suddenly
have
an
aberration
.
He
may
be
*NL*
conscious
and
know
what
he
is
doing
and
yet
be
in
a
state
of
aberration
.
*NL*
And
there
's
no
doubt
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
was
suffering
from
*NL*
aberration
.
They
found
out
about
aberration
as
soon
as
the
law
courts
were
*NL*
reformed
.
It
's
all
the
good
effect
of
the
reformed
law
courts
.
The
doctor
*NL*
has
been
here
and
questioned
me
about
that
evening
,
about
the
gold
mines
.
*NL*
`
How
did
he
seem
then
?
'
he
asked
me
.
He
must
have
been
in
a
state
of
*NL*
aberration
.
He
came
in
shouting
,
`
Money
,
money
,
three
thousand
!
Give
me
*NL*
three
thousand
!
'
and
then
went
away
and
immediately
did
the
murder
.
'
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
murder
him
,
'
he
said
,
and
he
suddenly
went
and
murdered
him
.
*NL*
That
's
why
they
'll
acquit
him
,
because
he
struggled
against
it
and
yet
he
*NL*
murdered
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
did
n't
murder
him
,
''
Alyosha
interrupted
rather
sharply
.
He
felt
*NL*
more
and
more
sick
with
anxiety
and
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
it
was
that
old
man
Grigory
murdered
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grigory
?
''
cried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
it
was
Grigory
.
He
lay
as
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
struck
him
down
,
*NL*
and
then
got
up
,
saw
the
door
open
,
went
in
and
killed
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suffering
from
aberration
.
When
he
recovered
from
the
blow
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
gave
him
on
the
head
,
he
was
suffering
from
aberration
;
he
*NL*
went
and
committed
the
murder
.
As
for
his
saying
he
did
n't
,
he
very
likely
*NL*
does
n't
remember
.
Only
,
you
know
,
it
'll
be
better
,
ever
so
much
better
,
if
*NL*
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
murdered
him
.
And
that
's
how
it
must
have
been
,
though
*NL*
I
say
it
was
Grigory
.
It
certainly
was
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
and
that
's
*NL*
better
,
ever
so
much
better
!
Oh
!
not
better
that
a
son
should
have
killed
*NL*
his
father
,
I
do
n't
defend
that
.
Children
ought
to
honor
their
parents
,
*NL*
and
yet
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
he
,
as
you
'd
have
nothing
to
cry
*NL*
over
then
,
for
he
did
it
when
he
was
unconscious
or
rather
when
he
was
*NL*
conscious
,
but
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
.
Let
them
acquit
him
--
that
's
*NL*
so
humane
,
and
would
show
what
a
blessing
reformed
law
courts
are
.
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
about
it
,
but
they
say
they
have
been
so
a
long
time
.
And
when
I
*NL*
heard
it
yesterday
,
I
was
so
struck
by
it
that
I
wanted
to
send
for
you
at
*NL*
once
.
And
if
he
is
acquitted
,
make
him
come
straight
from
the
law
courts
*NL*
to
dinner
with
me
,
and
I
'll
have
a
party
of
friends
,
and
we
'll
drink
to
*NL*
the
reformed
law
courts
.
I
do
n't
believe
he
'd
be
dangerous
;
besides
,
I
'll
*NL*
invite
a
great
many
friends
,
so
that
he
could
always
be
led
out
if
he
did
*NL*
anything
.
And
then
he
might
be
made
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
something
in
*NL*
another
town
,
for
those
who
have
been
in
trouble
themselves
make
the
best
*NL*
judges
.
And
,
besides
,
who
is
n't
suffering
from
aberration
nowadays
?
--
you
,
*NL*
I
,
all
of
us
are
in
a
state
of
aberration
,
and
there
are
ever
so
many
*NL*
examples
of
it
:
a
man
sits
singing
a
song
,
suddenly
something
annoys
him
,
*NL*
he
takes
a
pistol
and
shoots
the
first
person
he
comes
across
,
and
no
one
*NL*
blames
him
for
it
.
I
read
that
lately
,
and
all
the
doctors
confirm
it
.
The
*NL*
doctors
are
always
confirming
;
they
confirm
anything
.
Why
,
my
Lise
is
in
a
*NL*
state
of
aberration
.
She
made
me
cry
again
yesterday
,
and
the
day
before
,
*NL*
too
,
and
to-day
I
suddenly
realized
that
it
's
all
due
to
aberration
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Lise
grieves
me
so
!
I
believe
she
's
quite
mad
.
Why
did
she
send
for
you
?
*NL*
Did
she
send
for
you
or
did
you
come
of
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
sent
for
me
,
and
I
am
just
going
to
her
.
''
Alyosha
got
up
*NL*
resolutely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
dear
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
perhaps
that
's
what
's
most
*NL*
important
,
''
Madame
Hohlakov
cried
,
suddenly
bursting
into
tears
.
``
God
*NL*
knows
I
trust
Lise
to
you
with
all
my
heart
,
and
it
's
no
matter
her
*NL*
sending
for
you
on
the
sly
,
without
telling
her
mother
.
But
forgive
me
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
trust
my
daughter
so
easily
to
your
brother
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
though
I
still
consider
him
the
most
chivalrous
young
man
.
But
only
fancy
,
*NL*
he
's
been
to
see
Lise
and
I
knew
nothing
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
What
?
When
?
''
Alyosha
was
exceedingly
surprised
.
He
had
not
sat
down
*NL*
again
and
listened
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
;
that
's
perhaps
why
I
asked
you
to
come
,
for
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
now
why
I
did
ask
you
to
come
.
Well
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
has
been
to
see
me
*NL*
twice
,
since
he
came
back
from
Moscow
.
First
time
he
came
as
a
friend
to
*NL*
call
on
me
,
and
the
second
time
Katya
was
here
and
he
came
because
he
*NL*
heard
she
was
here
.
I
did
n't
,
of
course
,
expect
him
to
come
often
,
knowing
*NL*
what
a
lot
he
has
to
do
as
it
is
,
_
vous
comprenez
,
cette
affaire
et
la
*NL*
mort
terrible
de
votre
papa
_
.
But
I
suddenly
heard
he
'd
been
here
again
,
*NL*
not
to
see
me
but
to
see
Lise
.
That
's
six
days
ago
now
.
He
came
,
stayed
*NL*
five
minutes
,
and
went
away
.
And
I
did
n't
hear
of
it
till
three
days
*NL*
afterwards
,
from
Glafira
,
so
it
was
a
great
shock
to
me
.
I
sent
for
Lise
*NL*
directly
.
She
laughed
.
`
He
thought
you
were
asleep
,
'
she
said
,
`
and
came
*NL*
in
to
me
to
ask
after
your
health
.
'
Of
course
,
that
's
how
it
happened
.
But
*NL*
Lise
,
Lise
,
mercy
on
us
,
how
she
distresses
me
!
Would
you
believe
it
,
one
*NL*
night
,
four
days
ago
,
just
after
you
saw
her
last
time
,
and
had
gone
away
,
*NL*
she
suddenly
had
a
fit
,
screaming
,
shrieking
,
hysterics
!
Why
is
it
I
never
*NL*
have
hysterics
?
Then
,
next
day
another
fit
,
and
the
same
thing
on
the
*NL*
third
,
and
yesterday
too
,
and
then
yesterday
that
aberration
.
She
suddenly
*NL*
screamed
out
,
'
I
hate
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
.
I
insist
on
your
never
letting
*NL*
him
come
to
the
house
again
.
'
I
was
struck
dumb
at
these
amazing
words
,
*NL*
and
answered
,
`
On
what
grounds
could
I
refuse
to
see
such
an
excellent
*NL*
young
man
,
a
young
man
of
such
learning
too
,
and
so
unfortunate
?
'
--
for
all
*NL*
this
business
is
a
misfortune
,
is
n't
it
?
She
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
*NL*
at
my
words
,
and
so
rudely
,
you
know
.
Well
,
I
was
pleased
;
I
thought
I
had
*NL*
amused
her
and
the
fits
would
pass
off
,
especially
as
I
wanted
to
refuse
*NL*
to
see
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
anyway
on
account
of
his
strange
visits
without
*NL*
my
knowledge
,
and
meant
to
ask
him
for
an
explanation
.
But
early
this
*NL*
morning
Lise
waked
up
and
flew
into
a
passion
with
Yulia
and
,
would
you
*NL*
believe
it
,
slapped
her
in
the
face
.
That
's
monstrous
;
I
am
always
polite
*NL*
to
my
servants
.
And
an
hour
later
she
was
hugging
Yulia
's
feet
and
kissing
*NL*
them
.
She
sent
a
message
to
me
that
she
was
n't
coming
to
me
at
all
,
and
*NL*
would
never
come
and
see
me
again
,
and
when
I
dragged
myself
down
to
her
,
*NL*
she
rushed
to
kiss
me
,
crying
,
and
as
she
kissed
me
,
she
pushed
me
out
of
*NL*
the
room
without
saying
a
word
,
so
I
could
n't
find
out
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
.
Now
,
dear
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
I
rest
all
my
hopes
on
you
,
and
,
of
*NL*
course
,
my
whole
life
is
in
your
hands
.
I
simply
beg
you
to
go
to
Lise
and
*NL*
find
out
everything
from
her
,
as
you
alone
can
,
and
come
back
and
tell
*NL*
me
--
me
,
her
mother
,
for
you
understand
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
,
simply
*NL*
the
death
of
me
,
if
this
goes
on
,
or
else
I
shall
run
away
.
I
can
stand
no
*NL*
more
.
I
have
patience
;
but
I
may
lose
patience
,
and
then
...
then
*NL*
something
awful
will
happen
.
Ah
,
dear
me
!
At
last
,
Pyotr
Ilyitch

cried
*NL*
Madame
Hohlakov
,
beaming
all
over
as
she
saw
Perhotin
enter
the
room
.
``
You
*NL*
are
late

are
late

Well

down

us
out

counsel

off

``
Of

I

muttered
*NL*
Alyosha
,
beating
a
hasty
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Madame
Hohlakov
called
after
him

Alyosha
had
already
left
*NL*
the

Chapter
III

A
Little
Demon
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Going
in
to
Lise
,
he
found
her
half
reclining
in
the
invalid-chair
,
in
*NL*
which
she
had
been
wheeled
when
she
was
unable
to
walk
.
She
did
not
move
*NL*
to
meet
him
,
but
her
sharp
,
keen
eyes
were
simply
riveted
on
his
face
.
*NL*
There
was
a
feverish
look
in
her
eyes
,
her
face
was
pale
and
yellow
.
*NL*
Alyosha
was
amazed
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
in
three
*NL*
days
.
She
was
positively
thinner
.
She
did
not
hold
out
her
hand
to
him
.
He
*NL*
touched
the
thin
,
long
fingers
which
lay
motionless
on
her
dress
,
then
he
*NL*
sat
down
facing
her
,
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
the
prison
,
''
Lise
said
curtly
,
``
and
*NL*
mamma
's
kept
you
there
for
hours

a
certain
person
,
*NL*
begging
him
_
particularly
_
to
come
and
see
me
.
He
came
and
I
suddenly
told
*NL*
him
all
about
the
child
and
the
pineapple
_
compote
_
.
_
All
_
about
it
,
*NL*
_
all
_
,
and
said
that
it
was
nice
.
He
laughed
and
said
it
really
was
nice
.
*NL*
Then
he
got
up
and
went
away
.
He
was
only
here
five
minutes
.
Did
he
*NL*
despise
me
?
Did
he
despise
me
?
Tell
me
,
tell
me
,
Alyosha
,
did
he
despise
*NL*
me
or
not
?
''
She
sat
up
on
the
couch
,
with
flashing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
Alyosha
asked
anxiously
,
``
did
you
send
for
that
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
send
him
a
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
to
ask
about
that
,
about
that
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
about
that
at
all
.
But
when
he
came
,
I
asked
him
about
that
at
*NL*
once
.
He
answered
,
laughed
,
got
up
and
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
person
behaved
honorably
,
''
Alyosha
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
despise
me
?
Did
he
laugh
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
for
perhaps
he
believes
in
the
pineapple
_
compote
_
himself
.
He
is
*NL*
very
ill
now
,
too
,
Lise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
does
believe
in
it

''
said
Lise
,
with
flashing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
despise
any
one
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
.
``
Only
he
does
not
believe
*NL*
any
one
.
If
he
does
n't
believe
in
people
,
of
course
,
he
does
despise
*NL*
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
despises
me

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

''
Lise
seemed
to
grind
her
teeth
.
``
When
he
went
out
laughing
,
I
felt
*NL*
that
it
was
nice
to
be
despised
.
The
child
with
fingers
cut
off
is
nice
,
*NL*
and
to
be
despised
is
nice
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
laughed
in
Alyosha
's
face
,
a
feverish
malicious
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Alyosha
,
do
you
know

I
should
like

''
She
*NL*
suddenly
jumped
from
the
couch
,
rushed
to
him
and
seized
him
with
both
*NL*
hands
.
``
Save
me
!
''
she
almost
groaned
.
``
Is
there
any
one
in
the
world
I
*NL*
could
tell
what
I

told
you

I

told

the
truth

I

loathe

Alyosha
,
why
do
n't
you

love
me
in

''
she
finished
in
a
frenzy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
love
you
!
''
answered
Alyosha
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
weep
over

will
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

It
's
only

under

For

I
do

Do
you

not
any

On
the
contrary
,
I
hate
*NL*
him

Go
,
Alyosha
;
it
's
time
you
went
to
your
brother
''
;
she
tore
herself
*NL*
away
from
him
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
leave
you
like
this
?
''
said
Alyosha
,
almost
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
your
brother
,
the
prison
will
be
shut
;
go

here
's
your
hat

Give
my
*NL*
love
to
Mitya
,
go
,
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
almost
forcibly
pushed
Alyosha
out
of
the
door
.
He
looked
at
her
*NL*
with
pained
surprise
,
when
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
letter
in
his
right
*NL*
hand
,
a
tiny
letter
folded
up
tight
and
sealed
.
He
glanced
at
it
and
*NL*
instantly
read
the
address
,
``
To
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
.
''
He
looked
*NL*
quickly
at
Lise
.
Her
face
had
become
almost
menacing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
him
,
you
must
give
it
to
him
!
''
she
ordered
him
,
trembling
and
*NL*
beside
herself
.
``
To-day
,
at
once
,
or
I
'll
poison
myself
!
That
's
why
I
sent
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
slammed
the
door
quickly
.
The
bolt
clicked
.
Alyosha
put
the
note
*NL*
in
his
pocket
and
went
straight
downstairs
,
without
going
back
to
Madame
*NL*
Hohlakov
;
forgetting
her
,
in
fact
.
As
soon
as
Alyosha
had
gone
,
Lise
*NL*
unbolted
the
door
,
opened
it
a
little
,
put
her
finger
in
the
crack
and
*NL*
slammed
the
door
with
all
her
might
,
pinching
her
finger
.
Ten
seconds
*NL*
after
,
releasing
her
finger
,
she
walked
softly
,
slowly
to
her
chair
,
sat
*NL*
up
straight
in
it
and
looked
intently
at
her
blackened
finger
and
at
the
*NL*
blood
that
oozed
from
under
the
nail
.
Her
lips
were
quivering
and
she
kept
*NL*
whispering
rapidly
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
wretch
,
wretch
,
wretch
,
wretch

Chapter
IV
.
A
Hymn
And
A
Secret
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
late
-LRB-
days
are
short
in
November
-RRB-
when
Alyosha
rang
at
the
*NL*
prison
gate
.
It
was
beginning
to
get
dusk
.
But
Alyosha
knew
that
he
would
*NL*
be
admitted
without
difficulty
.
Things
were
managed
in
our
little
town
,
as
*NL*
everywhere
else
.
At
first
,
of
course
,
on
the
conclusion
of
the
preliminary
*NL*
inquiry
,
relations
and
a
few
other
persons
could
only
obtain
interviews
*NL*
with
Mitya
by
going
through
certain
inevitable
formalities
.
But
later
,
*NL*
though
the
formalities
were
not
relaxed
,
exceptions
were
made
for
some
,
at
*NL*
least
,
of
Mitya
's
visitors
.
So
much
so
,
that
sometimes
the
interviews
with
*NL*
the
prisoner
in
the
room
set
aside
for
the
purpose
were
practically
*NL*
_
tete-a-tete
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
exceptions
,
however
,
were
few
in
number
;
only
Grushenka
,
Alyosha
and
*NL*
Rakitin
were
treated
like
this
.
But
the
captain
of
the
police
,
Mihail
*NL*
Mihailovitch
,
was
very
favorably
disposed
to
Grushenka
.
His
abuse
of
her
*NL*
at
Mokroe
weighed
on
the
old
man
's
conscience
,
and
when
he
learned
the
*NL*
whole
story
,
he
completely
changed
his
view
of
her
.
And
strange
to
say
,
*NL*
though
he
was
firmly
persuaded
of
his
guilt
,
yet
after
Mitya
was
once
in
*NL*
prison
,
the
old
man
came
to
take
a
more
and
more
lenient
view
of
him
.
``
He
*NL*
was
a
man
of
good
heart
,
perhaps
,
''
he
thought
,
``
who
had
come
to
grief
from
*NL*
drinking
and
dissipation
.
''
His
first
horror
had
been
succeeded
by
pity
.
As
*NL*
for
Alyosha
,
the
police
captain
was
very
fond
of
him
and
had
known
him
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
Rakitin
,
who
had
of
late
taken
to
coming
very
often
to
see
*NL*
the
prisoner
,
was
one
of
the
most
intimate
acquaintances
of
the
``
police
*NL*
captain
's
young
ladies
,
''
as
he
called
them
,
and
was
always
hanging
about
*NL*
their
house
.
He
gave
lessons
in
the
house
of
the
prison
superintendent
,
*NL*
too
,
who
,
though
scrupulous
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
,
was
a
kind
-
*NL*
hearted
old
man
.
Alyosha
,
again
,
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
long
*NL*
standing
with
the
superintendent
,
who
was
fond
of
talking
to
him
,
*NL*
generally
on
sacred
subjects
.
He
respected
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
and
stood
in
*NL*
awe
of
his
opinion
,
though
he
was
a
great
philosopher
himself
;
``
self
-
*NL*
taught
,
''
of
course
.
But
Alyosha
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
him
.
*NL*
During
the
last
year
the
old
man
had
taken
to
studying
the
Apocryphal
*NL*
Gospels
,
and
constantly
talked
over
his
impressions
with
his
young
friend
.
*NL*
He
used
to
come
and
see
him
in
the
monastery
and
discussed
for
hours
*NL*
together
with
him
and
with
the
monks
.
So
even
if
Alyosha
were
late
at
the
*NL*
prison
,
he
had
only
to
go
to
the
superintendent
and
everything
was
made
*NL*
easy
.
Besides
,
every
one
in
the
prison
,
down
to
the
humblest
warder
,
had
*NL*
grown
used
to
Alyosha
.
The
sentry
,
of
course
,
did
not
trouble
him
so
long
*NL*
as
the
authorities
were
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mitya
was
summoned
from
his
cell
,
he
always
went
downstairs
,
to
the
*NL*
place
set
aside
for
interviews
.
As
Alyosha
entered
the
room
he
came
upon
*NL*
Rakitin
,
who
was
just
taking
leave
of
Mitya
.
They
were
both
talking
*NL*
loudly
.
Mitya
was
laughing
heartily
as
he
saw
him
out
,
while
Rakitin
*NL*
seemed
grumbling
.
Rakitin
did
not
like
meeting
Alyosha
,
especially
of
*NL*
late
.
He
scarcely
spoke
to
him
,
and
bowed
to
him
stiffly
.
Seeing
Alyosha
*NL*
enter
now
,
he
frowned
and
looked
away
,
as
though
he
were
entirely
absorbed
*NL*
in
buttoning
his
big
,
warm
,
fur-trimmed
overcoat
.
Then
he
began
looking
at
*NL*
once
for
his
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
mind
not
to
forget
my
belongings
,
''
he
muttered
,
simply
to
say
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
do
n't
forget
other
people
's
belongings
,
''
said
Mitya
,
as
a
joke
,
*NL*
and
laughed
at
once
at
his
own
wit
.
Rakitin
fired
up
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
give
that
advice
to
your
own
family
,
who
've
always
been
a
*NL*
slave-driving
lot
,
and
not
to
Rakitin
,
''
he
cried
,
suddenly
trembling
with
*NL*
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
I
was
joking
,
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
Damn
it
all
!
They
are
all
*NL*
like
that
,
''
he
turned
to
Alyosha
,
nodding
towards
Rakitin
's
hurriedly
*NL*
retreating
figure
.
``
He
was
sitting
here
,
laughing
and
cheerful
,
and
all
at
*NL*
once
he
boils
up
like
that
.
He
did
n't
even
nod
to
you
.
Have
you
broken
*NL*
with
him
completely
?
Why
are
you
so
late
?
I
've
not
been
simply
waiting
,
*NL*
but
thirsting
for
you
the
whole
morning
.
But
never
mind
.
We
'll
make
up
for
*NL*
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
he
come
here
so
often
?
Surely
you
are
not
such
great
friends
?
''
*NL*
asked
Alyosha
.
He
,
too
,
nodded
at
the
door
through
which
Rakitin
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
friends
with
Rakitin
?
No
,
not
as
much
as
that
.
Is
it
likely
--
a
pig
*NL*
like
that
?
He
considers
I
am
...
a
blackguard
.
They
ca
n't
understand
a
*NL*
joke
either
,
that
's
the
worst
of
such
people
.
They
never
understand
a
*NL*
joke
,
and
their
souls
are
dry
,
dry
and
flat
;
they
remind
me
of
prison
*NL*
walls
when
I
was
first
brought
here
.
But
he
is
a
clever
fellow
,
very
*NL*
clever
.
Well
,
Alexey
,
it
's
all
over
with
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
made
Alyosha
sit
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
trial
's
to-morrow
.
Are
you
so
hopeless
,
brother
?
''
Alyosha
said
,
*NL*
with
an
apprehensive
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about
?
''
said
Mitya
,
looking
at
him
rather
*NL*
uncertainly
.
``
Oh
,
you
mean
the
trial
!
Damn
it
all
!
Till
now
we
've
been
*NL*
talking
of
things
that
do
n't
matter
,
about
this
trial
,
but
I
have
n't
said
*NL*
a
word
to
you
about
the
chief
thing
.
Yes
,
the
trial
is
to-morrow
;
but
it
*NL*
was
n't
the
trial
I
meant
,
when
I
said
it
was
all
over
with
me
.
Why
do
you
*NL*
look
at
me
so
critically

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

He

he
'll

sort
I
*NL*
do
n't
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

him

then

I
do

either

swore
Mitya
.
``
A
scoundrel
of
*NL*
some

most

They
are
all

And
Rakitin
will
make
his
*NL*
way

Rakitin
will
get
on
anywhere

another

these

Bernards

They
are
all
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
matter
?
''
Alyosha
asked
insistently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
to
write
an
article
about
me
,
about
my
case
,
and
so
begin
his
*NL*
literary
career

That
's
what
he
comes
for
;
he
said
so
himself
.
He
wants
to
*NL*
prove
some
theory
.
He
wants
to
say
`
he
could
n't
help
murdering
his
father
,
*NL*
he
was
corrupted
by
his
environment
,
'
and
so
on
.
He
explained
it
all
to
*NL*
me
.
He
is
going
to
put
in
a
tinge
of
Socialism
,
he
says
.
But
there
,
damn
*NL*
the
fellow
,
he
can
put
in
a
tinge
if
he
likes
,
I
do
n't
care

He
ca
n't
bear
*NL*
Ivan

he
hates
him

He
's
not
fond
of
you

either

But
I
do
n't
turn
him
*NL*
out
,
for
he
is
a
clever
fellow

Awfully
conceited

though
.
I
said
to
him
*NL*
just
now
,
`
The
Karamazovs
are
not
blackguards
,
but
philosophers
;
for
all
*NL*
true
Russians
are
philosophers

and
though
you
've
studied
,
you
are
not
a

philosopher

you
are
a
low
fellow

He
laughed
,
so
maliciously
.
And
I
said
*NL*
to
him
,
'
_
De

'
Is
n't
that
rather
good

I
can
*NL*
set
up
for

classic

Mitya
laughed
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*

Why
is
it
all
over

You
said
so
just
now

Alyosha
interposed

The

there
are

the

quivering

I
look

something

an

All
that
is
nonsense

Rakitin
explained
it
all
to
me
yesterday
,
brother

*NL*
and
it
simply
bowled
me
over
.
It
's
magnificent

Alyosha

this
science

A

arising

*NL*
Rakitin
does

That

the
sore

But
they
conceal

They
tell

They

did
*NL*
it
openly

He
laughed

what
will

become

I
asked

He

I
used
to
kick

listen

He
talks
a

He
began
reading

an

copied

*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
hurriedly
pulled
out
a
piece

paper
from
his
pocket
and
read
:

''
`
In
order
to
determine
this
question

is
above
all
essential
to
put

one

contradiction
to
one

reality

Do
you
understand
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
do
n't

''
said
Alyosha
.
He
looked
at
Mitya
and
listened
to
him
with
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
either

It
's
dark
and
obscure

intellectual

*NL*
`
Every

like
that
now

he
says
,
`
it
's
the
effect
of
their
*NL*
environment
.
'
They
are
afraid
of
the
environment

He
writes
poetry
,
too
,
*NL*
the
rascal

He
's
written
in
honor
of
Madame
Hohlakov
's
foot

Ha
ha
ha

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
about

do

I
have
n't
*NL*
told
you

there
's
quite
a
story
about
it

He
's
a
rascal
!
Three
weeks
ago
he
*NL*
began
to
tease
me
.
`
You
've
got
yourself
into
a
mess
,
like
a
fool
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
three
thousand
,
but
I
'm
going
to
collar
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
thousand
.
I
am
going
to
marry
a
widow
and
buy
a
house
in
Petersburg
.
'
And
*NL*
he
told
me
he
was
courting
Madame
Hohlakov
.
She
had
n't
much
brains
in
her
*NL*
youth
,
and
now
at
forty
she
has
lost
what
she
had
.
`
But
she
's
awfully
*NL*
sentimental
,
'
he
says
;
`
that
's
how
I
shall
get
hold
of
her
.
When
I
marry
*NL*
her
,
I
shall
take
her
to
Petersburg
and
there
I
shall
start
a
newspaper
.
'
*NL*
And
his
mouth
was
simply
watering
,
the
beast
,
not
for
the
widow
,
but
for
*NL*
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
.
And
he
made
me
believe
it
.
He
came
to
see
*NL*
me
every
day
.
`
She
is
coming
round
,
'
he
declared
.
He
was
beaming
with
*NL*
delight
.
And
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
was
turned
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
Perhotin
's
carrying
everything
before
him
,
bravo
!
I
could
kiss
the
silly
*NL*
old
noodle
for
turning
him
out
of
the
house
.
And
he
had
written
this
*NL*
doggerel
.
`
It
's
the
first
time
I
've
soiled
my
hands
with
writing
poetry
,
'
*NL*
he
said
.
`
It
's
to
win
her
heart
,
so
it
's
in
a
good
cause
.
When
I
get
hold
*NL*
of
the
silly
woman
's
fortune
,
I
can
be
of
great
social
utility
.
'
They
have
*NL*
this
social
justification
for
every
nasty
thing
they
do
!
`
Anyway
it
's
*NL*
better
than
your
Pushkin
's
poetry
,
'
he
said
,
`
for
I
've
managed
to
advocate
*NL*
enlightenment
even
in
that
.
'
I
understand
what
he
means
about
Pushkin
,
I
*NL*
quite
see
that
,
if
he
really
was
a
man
of
talent
and
only
wrote
about
*NL*
women
's
feet
.
But
was
n't
Rakitin
stuck
up
about
his
doggerel
!
The
vanity
*NL*
of
these
fellows
!
`
On
the
convalescence
of
the
swollen
foot
of
the
object
*NL*
of
my
affections
'
--
he
thought
of
that
for
a
title
.
He
's
a
waggish
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
captivating
little
foot
,
*NL*
Though
swollen
and
red
and
tender
!
*NL*
The
doctors
come
and
plasters
put
,
*NL*
But
still
they
can
not
mend
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
't
is
not
for
her
foot
I
dread
--
*NL*
A
theme
for
Pushkin
's
muse
more
fit
--
*NL*
It
's
not
her
foot
,
it
is
her
head
:
*NL*
I
tremble
for
her
loss
of
wit
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
as
her
foot
swells
,
strange
to
say
,
*NL*
Her
intellect
is
on
the
wane
--
*NL*
Oh
,
for
some
remedy
I
pray
*NL*
That
may
restore
both
foot
and
brain
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
a
pig
,
a
regular
pig
,
but
he
's
very
arch
,
the
rascal
!
And
he
really
*NL*
has
put
in
a
progressive
idea
.
And
was
n't
he
angry
when
she
kicked
him
*NL*
out
!
He
was
gnashing
his
teeth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
taken
his
revenge
already

said
Alyosha
.
``
He
's
written
a
paragraph
*NL*
about
Madame
Hohlakov

*NL*
*NL*
And
Alyosha
told
him
briefly
about
the
paragraph
in
_
Gossip
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
his
doing

's
his
doing

Mitya
assented
,
frowning
.
``

paragraphs

I
know

the
insulting
things

Grushenka

for
instance

And
about
Katya

*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
across
the
room
with
a
harassed
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
I
can
not
stay
long

Alyosha
said
,
after
a
pause
.
``

great

awful

amazed

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mitya
broke
in
warmly
.
``

to
talk

*NL*
stinking
dog

the
murderer

've
talked
enough

I
do
n't
want

say
more

stinking
son

Stinking
Lizaveta

God
will
kill
him

you
*NL*
will
see

Hush

*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
Alyosha
excitedly
and
kissed
him
.
His
eyes
glowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rakitin
would
n't
understand
it
,
''
he
began
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
;
``
but
*NL*
you
,
you
'll
understand
it
all

That
's
why
I
was
thirsting
for
you
.
You
*NL*
see
,
there
's
so
much
I
've
been
wanting
to
tell
you
for
ever
so
long
,
here
,
*NL*
within
these
peeling
walls
,
but
I
have
n't
said
a
word
about
what
matters
*NL*
most
;
the
moment
never
seems
to
have
come
.
Now
I
can
wait
no
longer
.
I
*NL*
must
pour
out
my
heart
to
you
.
Brother
,
these
last
two
months
I
've
found
*NL*
in
myself
a
new
man
.
A
new
man
has
risen
up
in
me
.
He
was
hidden
in
me
,
*NL*
but
would
never
have
come
to
the
surface
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
this
blow
*NL*
from
heaven
.
I
am
afraid
!
And
what
do
I
care
if
I
spend
twenty
years
in
*NL*
the
mines
,
breaking
ore
with
a
hammer
?
I
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
that
--
it
's
*NL*
something
else
I
am
afraid
of
now
:
that
that
new
man
may
leave
me
.
Even
*NL*
there
,
in
the
mines
,
under-ground
,
I
may
find
a
human
heart
in
another
*NL*
convict
and
murderer
by
my
side
,
and
I
may
make
friends
with
him
,
for
even
*NL*
there
one
may
live
and
love
and
suffer
.
One
may
thaw
and
revive
a
frozen
*NL*
heart
in
that
convict
,
one
may
wait
upon
him
for
years
,
and
at
last
bring
*NL*
up
from
the
dark
depths
a
lofty
soul
,
a
feeling
,
suffering
creature
;
one
*NL*
may
bring
forth
an
angel
,
create
a
hero
!
There
are
so
many
of
them
,
*NL*
hundreds
of
them
,
and
we
are
all
to
blame
for
them
.
Why
was
it
I
dreamed
*NL*
of
that
`
babe
'
at
such
a
moment
?
`
Why
is
the
babe
so
poor
?
'
That
was
a
*NL*
sign
to
me
at
that
moment
.
It
's
for
the
babe
I
'm
going
.
Because
we
are
all
*NL*
responsible
for
all
.
For
all
the
`
babes
,
'
for
there
are
big
children
as
*NL*
well
as
little
children
.
All
are
`
babes
.
'
I
go
for
all
,
because
some
one
*NL*
must
go
for
all
.
I
did
n't
kill
father
,
but
I
've
got
to
go
.
I
accept
it
.
*NL*
It
's
all
come
to
me
here
,
here
,
within
these
peeling
walls
.
There
are
*NL*
numbers
of
them
there
,
hundreds
of
them
underground
,
with
hammers
in
their
*NL*
hands
.
Oh
,
yes
,
we
shall
be
in
chains
and
there
will
be
no
freedom
,
but
*NL*
then
,
in
our
great
sorrow
,
we
shall
rise
again
to
joy
,
without
which
man
*NL*
can
not
live
nor
God
exist
,
for
God
gives
joy
:
it
's
His
privilege
--
a
grand
*NL*
one
.
Ah
,
man
should
be
dissolved
in
prayer
!
What
should
I
be
underground
*NL*
there
without
God
?
Rakitin
's
laughing
!
If
they
drive
God
from
the
earth
,
*NL*
we
shall
shelter
Him
underground
.
One
can
not
exist
in
prison
without
God
;
*NL*
it
's
even
more
impossible
than
out
of
prison
.
And
then
we
men
underground
*NL*
will
sing
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
a
glorious
hymn
to
God
,
with
Whom
*NL*
is
joy
.
Hail
to
God
and
His
joy
!
I
love
Him
!

*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
almost
gasping
for
breath
as
he
uttered
his
wild
speech
.
He
*NL*
turned
pale
,
his
lips
quivered
,
and
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
life
is
full
,
there
is
life
even
underground
,
''
he
began
again
.
``
You
*NL*
would
n't
believe
,
Alexey
,
how
I
want
to
live
now
,
what
a
thirst
for
*NL*
existence
and
consciousness
has
sprung
up
in
me
within
these
peeling
*NL*
walls
.
Rakitin
does
n't
understand
that
;
all
he
cares
about
is
building
a
*NL*
house
and
letting
flats
.
But
I
've
been
longing
for
you
.
And
what
is
*NL*
suffering
?
I
am
not
afraid
of
it
,
even
if
it
were
beyond
reckoning
.
I
am
*NL*
not
afraid
of
it
now
.
I
was
afraid
of
it
before
.
Do
you
know
,
perhaps
I
*NL*
wo
n't
answer
at
the
trial
at
all
...
And
I
seem
to
have
such
strength
in
*NL*
me
now
,
that
I
think
I
could
stand
anything
,
any
suffering
,
only
to
be
*NL*
able
to
say
and
to
repeat
to
myself
every
moment
,
'
I
exist
.
'
In
thousands
*NL*
of
agonies
--
I
exist
.
I
'm
tormented
on
the
rack
--
but
I
exist
!
Though
I
sit
*NL*
alone
on
a
pillar
--
I
exist
!
I
see
the
sun
,
and
if
I
do
n't
see
the
sun
,
I
*NL*
know
it
's
there
.
And
there
's
a
whole
life
in
that
,
in
knowing
that
the
sun
*NL*
is
there
.
Alyosha
,
my
angel
,
all
these
philosophies
are
the
death
of
me
.
*NL*
Damn
them
!
Brother
Ivan
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
brother
Ivan
?
''
interrupted
Alyosha
,
but
Mitya
did
not
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
never
had
any
of
these
doubts
before
,
but
it
was
all
hidden
*NL*
away
in
me
.
It
was
perhaps
just
because
ideas
I
did
not
understand
were
*NL*
surging
up
in
me
,
that
I
used
to
drink
and
fight
and
rage
.
It
was
to
*NL*
stifle
them
in
myself
,
to
still
them
,
to
smother
them
.
Ivan
is
not
*NL*
Rakitin
,
there
is
an
idea
in
him
.
Ivan
is
a
sphinx
and
is
silent
;
he
is
*NL*
always
silent
.
It
's
God
that
's
worrying
me
.
That
's
the
only
thing
that
's
*NL*
worrying
me
.
What
if
He
does
n't
exist
?
What
if
Rakitin
's
right
--
that
it
's
*NL*
an
idea
made
up
by
men
?
Then
if
He
does
n't
exist
,
man
is
the
chief
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
of
the
universe
.
Magnificent
!
Only
how
is
he
going
to
be
good
*NL*
without
God
?
That
's
the
question
.
I
always
come
back
to
that
.
For
whom
is
*NL*
man
going
to
love
then
?
To
whom
will
he
be
thankful
?
To
whom
will
he
sing
*NL*
the
hymn
?
Rakitin
laughs
.
Rakitin
says
that
one
can
love
humanity
without
*NL*
God
.
Well
,
only
a
sniveling
idiot
can
maintain
that
.
I
ca
n't
understand
*NL*
it
.
Life
's
easy
for
Rakitin
.
`
You
'd
better
think
about
the
extension
of
*NL*
civic
rights
,
or
even
of
keeping
down
the
price
of
meat
.
You
will
show
*NL*
your
love
for
humanity
more
simply
and
directly
by
that
,
than
by
*NL*
philosophy
.
'
I
answered
him
,
`
Well
,
but
you
,
without
a
God
,
are
more
*NL*
likely
to
raise
the
price
of
meat
,
if
it
suits
you
,
and
make
a
rouble
on
*NL*
every
copeck
.
'
He
lost
his
temper
.
But
after
all
,
what
is
goodness
?
Answer
*NL*
me
that
,
Alexey
.
Goodness
is
one
thing
with
me
and
another
with
a
*NL*
Chinaman
,
so
it
's
a
relative
thing
.
Or
is
n't
it
?
Is
it
not
relative
?
A
*NL*
treacherous
question
!
You
wo
n't
laugh
if
I
tell
you
it
's
kept
me
awake
two
*NL*
nights
.
I
only
wonder
now
how
people
can
live
and
think
nothing
about
it
.
*NL*
Vanity
!
Ivan
has
no
God
.
He
has
an
idea
.
It
's
beyond
me
.
But
he
is
silent
.
*NL*
I
believe
he
is
a
free-mason
.
I
asked
him
,
but
he
is
silent
.
I
wanted
to
*NL*
drink
from
the
springs
of
his
soul
--
he
was
silent
.
But
once
he
did
drop
a
*NL*
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
say
?
''
Alyosha
took
it
up
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
to
him

`
Then
everything
is
lawful

He
frowned

*NL*
`
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
our
papa

'
he
said
,
`
was
a
pig
,
but
his
ideas
were
*NL*
right
enough

'
That
was
what
he
dropped
.
That
was
all
he
said
.
That
was
*NL*
going
one
better
than
Rakitin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
Alyosha
assented
bitterly
.
``
When
was
he
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
later
;
now
I
must
speak
of
something
else

I
have
said
nothing
*NL*
about
Ivan

you
before

I
put
it
off
to
the
last

When
my
business
here
*NL*
is
over

the
verdict
has
been
given

then
I
'll
tell
you
something

I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
everything

We
've
something
tremendous
on

And
you
shall
*NL*
be
my
judge
in
it

But
do
n't
begin
about
that
now

be
silent

You
talk
of
*NL*
to-morrow
,
of
the
trial

you
believe

I
know
nothing

*NL*
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
talked

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use

all
about

city-bred
rogue

a
Bernard

But
he
does
n't

not
a

Only
*NL*
imagine

he
believes

did
it

I
see

In

I
asked
him

why
*NL*
have
you
come
to
defend

Hang
them
all

prove

end

smiled
bitterly
.
*NL*
``
The
cat

Hard-hearted
creature

She
knows

of

woman
of
`
great
wrath

They
repeated
it
.
Yes
,
the
facts
*NL*
against
me
have
grown
numerous
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
.
Grigory
sticks
to
*NL*
his
point
.
Grigory
's
honest
,
but
a
fool

Many
people
are
honest
because
*NL*
they
are
fools
:
that
's
Rakitin
's
idea
.
Grigory
's
my
enemy

And
there
are
*NL*
some
people
who
are
better
as
foes
than
friends

I
mean
Katerina
Ivanovna

*NL*
I
am
afraid
,
oh
,
I
am
afraid
she
will
tell
how
she
bowed
to
the
ground
*NL*
after
that
four
thousand
.
She
'll
pay
it
back

sacrifice

they
'll
put
me
to
shame

trial

wonder
how

can
stand
it

Go
to
her
,
Alyosha

ask

not

But
damn
it

get
through

I
shall

smiled
bitterly
again

*NL*
``
Only

``

you

exclaimed
Alyosha

Mitya
laughed
almost
mirthfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
preserve
you

my
dear
boy

from
ever
asking
forgiveness
for
a
fault
*NL*
from
a
woman
you
love

From
one
you
love
especially
,
however
greatly
you
*NL*
may
have
been
in
fault

For
a
woman
--
devil
only
knows
what
to
make
of
a

woman

I
know
something
about

try
acknowledging
you
are
*NL*
in
fault

Say
,
'
I
am
sorry
,
forgive
me
,
'
and
a
shower
of
*NL*
reproaches
will
follow
!
Nothing
will
make
her
forgive
you
simply
and
*NL*
directly
,
she
'll
humble
you
to
the
dust
,
bring
forward
things
that
have
*NL*
never
happened
,
recall
everything
,
forget
nothing
,
add
something
of
her
*NL*
own
,
and
only
then
forgive
you
.
And
even
the
best
,
the
best
of
them
do
it

*NL*
She
'll
scrape
up
all
the
scrapings
and
load
them
on
your
head

They
are
*NL*
ready
to
flay
you
alive

I
tell
you

every
one
of
them

all
these
angels
*NL*
without
whom
we
can
not
live

I
tell
you
plainly
and
openly
,
dear
boy
,
*NL*
every
decent
man
ought
to
be
under
some
woman
's
thumb
.
That
's
my
*NL*
conviction
--
not
conviction
,
but
feeling
.
A
man
ought
to
be
magnanimous
,
and
*NL*
it
's
no
disgrace
to
a
man
!
No
disgrace
to
a
hero
,
not
even
a
Caesar
!
But
*NL*
do
n't
ever
beg
her
pardon
all
the
same
for
anything
.
Remember
that
rule
*NL*
given
you
by
your
brother
Mitya
,
who
's
come
to
ruin
through
women
.
No
,
I
'd
*NL*
better
make
it
up
to
Grusha
somehow
,
without
begging
pardon
.
I
worship
*NL*
her
,
Alexey
,
worship
her
.
Only
she
does
n't
see
it
.
No
,
she
still
thinks
I
*NL*
do
n't
love
her
enough
.
And
she
tortures
me
,
tortures
me
with
her
love
.
The
*NL*
past
was
nothing
!
In
the
past
it
was
only
those
infernal
curves
of
hers
*NL*
that
tortured
me
,
but
now
I
've
taken
all
her
soul
into
my
soul
and
through
*NL*
her
I
've
become
a
man
myself
.
Will
they
marry
us
?
If
they
do
n't
,
I
shall
*NL*
die
of
jealousy
.
I
imagine
something
every
day
...
What
did
she
say
to
you
*NL*
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
repeated
all
Grushenka
had
said
to
him
that
day
.
Mitya
listened
,
*NL*
made
him
repeat
things
,
and
seemed
pleased

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
is
not
angry
at
my
being
jealous

he
exclaimed

``
She

regular
woman

a
fierce

myself

Ah

I
love
such
fierce
*NL*
hearts

love

infinitely

Will
they
marry

Do
they
let
convicts
marry

's
the
question

without
her
I
ca
n't
exist

*NL*
Mitya
walked
frowning
across
the
room

It
was
almost
dark

He
suddenly
*NL*
seemed
terribly
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
's
a
secret

she
says

up
a

her

Katya

mixed
up
in
it

No

good
Grushenka

's
not
it

very
wide

*NL*
way

well

here
goes

'll
tell
you
our
secret

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
,
went
close
up
quickly
to
Alyosha
,
who
was
standing
before
*NL*
him
,
and
whispered
to
him
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
though
in
reality
no
one
*NL*
could
hear
them
:
the
old
warder
was
dozing
in
the
corner
,
and
not
a
word
*NL*
could
reach
the
ears
of
the
soldiers
on
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
all
our
secret
,
''
Mitya
whispered
hurriedly
.
``
I
meant
to
*NL*
tell
you
later

for
how
could
I
decide
on
anything
without
you

everything
to
me

Though
I
say
that
Ivan
is
superior
to
us

you
are
my
*NL*
angel

It
's
your
decision
will
decide
it

Perhaps
it
's
you
that
is
*NL*
superior
and
not
Ivan

You
see
,
it
's
a
question
of
conscience

question
of
*NL*
the
higher
conscience

the
secret
is
so
important
that
I
ca
n't
settle
it

myself

I
've
put
it
off
till

speak
to
you

But
anyway
it
's
too
*NL*
early
to

n't
decide
.
Stand
and
keep
quiet
.
I
wo
n't
tell
*NL*
you
everything
.
I
'll
only
tell
you
the
idea
,
without
details
,
and
you
keep
*NL*
quiet
.
Not
a
question
,
not
a
movement
.
You
agree
?
But
,
goodness
,
what
*NL*
shall
I
do
with
your
eyes
?
I
'm
afraid
your
eyes
will
tell
me
your
*NL*
decision
,
even
if
you
do
n't
speak
.
Oo
!
I
'm
afraid
!
Alyosha
,
listen
!
Ivan
*NL*
suggests
my
_
escaping
_
.
I
wo
n't
tell
you
the
details
:
it
's
all
been
*NL*
thought
out
:
it
can
all
be
arranged
.
Hush
,
do
n't
decide
.
I
should
go
to
*NL*
America
with
Grusha
.
You
know
I
ca
n't
live
without
Grusha
!
What
if
they
*NL*
wo
n't
let
her
follow
me
to
Siberia
?
Do
they
let
convicts
get
married
?
Ivan
*NL*
thinks
not
.
And
without
Grusha
what
should
I
do
there
underground
with
a
*NL*
hammer
?
I
should
only
smash
my
skull
with
the
hammer
!
But
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
my
conscience
?
I
should
have
run
away
from
suffering
.
A
sign
has
*NL*
come
,
I
reject
the
sign
.
I
have
a
way
of
salvation
and
I
turn
my
back
on
*NL*
it
.
Ivan
says
that
in
America
,
`
with
the
good-will
,
'
I
can
be
of
more
use
*NL*
than
underground
.
But
what
becomes
of
our
hymn
from
underground
?
What
's
*NL*
America
?
America
is
vanity
again
!
And
there
's
a
lot
of
swindling
in
*NL*
America
,
too
,
I
expect
.
I
should
have
run
away
from
crucifixion
!
I
tell
*NL*
you
,
you
know
,
Alexey
,
because
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
understand
*NL*
this
.
There
's
no
one
else
.
It
's
folly
,
madness
to
others
,
all
I
've
told
*NL*
you
of
the
hymn
.
They
'll
say
I
'm
out
of
my
mind
or
a
fool
.
I
am
not
out
of
*NL*
my
mind
and
I
am
not
a
fool
.
Ivan
understands
about
the
hymn
,
too
.
He
*NL*
understands
,
only
he
does
n't
answer
--
he
does
n't
speak
.
He
does
n't
believe
*NL*
in
the
hymn
.
Do
n't
speak
,
do
n't
speak
.
I
see
how
you
look
!
You
have
*NL*
already
decided
.
Do
n't
decide
,
spare
me
!
I
ca
n't
live
without
Grusha
.
Wait
*NL*
till
after
the
trial
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
ended
beside
himself
.
He
held
Alyosha
with
both
hands
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
his
yearning
,
feverish
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
brother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
let
convicts
marry
,
do
they
?
''
he
repeated
for
the
third
time
*NL*
in
a
supplicating
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
listened
with
extreme
surprise
and
was
deeply
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
one
thing
,
''
he
said
.
``
Is
Ivan
very
keen
on
it
,
and
whose
idea
was
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
,
his
,
and
he
is
very
keen
on
it
.
He
did
n't
come
to
see
me
at
first
,
*NL*
then
he
suddenly
came
a
week
ago
and
he
began
about
it
straight
away
.
He
*NL*
is
awfully
keen
on
it
.
He
does
n't
ask
me
,
but
orders
me
to
escape
.
He
*NL*
does
n't
doubt
of
my
obeying
him
,
though
I
showed
him
all
my
heart
as
I
*NL*
have
to
you
,
and
told
him
about
the
hymn
,
too
.
He
told
me
he
'd
arrange
it
;
*NL*
he
's
found
out
about
everything
.
But
of
that
later
.
He
's
simply
set
on
it
.
*NL*
It
's
all
a
matter
of
money
:
he
'll
pay
ten
thousand
for
escape
and
give
me
*NL*
twenty
thousand
for
America
.
And
he
says
we
can
arrange
a
magnificent
*NL*
escape
for
ten
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
told
you
on
no
account
to
tell
me
?
''
Alyosha
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
no
one
,
and
especially
not
you

on
no
account
to
tell
you

He
is
*NL*
afraid

no
doubt
,
that
you
'll
stand
before
me

Do

tell
*NL*
him
I

Do

tell
him
,
for
anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
Alyosha
pronounced
;
``
it
's
impossible
to
decide
anything
*NL*
before
the
trial
is
over
.
After
the
trial
you
'll
decide

yourself
.
Then
*NL*
you
'll
find
that
new
man
in
yourself
and
he
will
decide
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new

a
*NL*
contemptible

said
Mitya
,
with
a
bitter
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
brother
,
have
you
no
hope
then
of
being
acquitted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
shrugged
his
shoulders
nervously
and
shook
his
head
.
``
Alyosha
,
*NL*
darling
,
it
's
time
you
were
going
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
sudden
haste
.
``
There
's
*NL*
the
superintendent
shouting
in
the
yard
.
He
'll
be
here
directly
.
We
are
*NL*
late
;
it
's
irregular
.
Embrace
me
quickly
.
Kiss
me
!
Sign
me
with
the
cross
,
*NL*
darling
,
for
the
cross
I
have
to
bear
to-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
embraced
and
kissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
,
''
said
Mitya
suddenly
,
``
suggests
my
escaping
;
but
,
of
course
,
he
*NL*
believes
I
did
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
mournful
smile
came
on
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
asked
him
whether
he
believes
it
?
''
asked
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
.
I
wanted
to
,
but
I
could
n't

I
had
n't
the
courage
.
But
I
*NL*
saw
it
from
his
eyes
.
Well
,
good-by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
they
kissed
hurriedly
,
and
Alyosha
was
just
going
out
,
when
*NL*
Mitya
suddenly
called
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
facing
me
!
That
's
right
!
''
And
again
he
seized
Alyosha
,
putting
both
*NL*
hands
on
his
shoulders
.
His
face
became
suddenly
quite
pale
,
so
that
it
*NL*
was
dreadfully
apparent
,
even
through
the
gathering
darkness
.
His
lips
*NL*
twitched
,
his
eyes
fastened
upon
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
tell
me
the
whole
truth
,
as
you
would
before
God
.
Do
you
believe
*NL*
I
did
it
?
Do
you
,
do
you
in
yourself
,
believe
it
?
The
whole
truth
,
do
n't
*NL*
lie
!
''
he
cried
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
seemed
heaving
before
Alyosha
,
and
he
felt
something
like
a
*NL*
stab
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
What
do
you
mean
?
''
he
faltered
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
truth
,
the
whole
,
do
n't
lie
!
''
repeated
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
for
one
instant
believed
that
you
were
the
murderer
!
''
broke
in
*NL*
a
shaking
voice
from
Alyosha
's
breast
,
and
he
raised
his
right
hand
in
the
*NL*
air
,
as
though
calling
God
to
witness
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
's
whole
face
was
lighted
up
with
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
he
articulated
slowly
,
as
though
letting
a
sigh
escape
him
*NL*
after
fainting
.
``
Now
you
have
given
me
new
life
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
*NL*
till
this
moment
I
've
been
afraid
to
ask
you
,
you
,
even
you
.
Well
,
go
!
*NL*
You
've
given
me
strength
for
to-morrow
.
God
bless
you
!
Come
,
go
along
!
*NL*
Love
Ivan
!
''
was
Mitya
's
last
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
out
in
tears
.
Such
distrustfulness
in
Mitya
,
such
lack
of
*NL*
confidence
even
to
him
,
to
Alyosha
--
all
this
suddenly
opened
before
Alyosha
*NL*
an
unsuspected
depth
of
hopeless
grief
and
despair
in
the
soul
of
his
*NL*
unhappy
brother
.
Intense
,
infinite
compassion
overwhelmed
him
instantly
.
*NL*
There
was
a
poignant
ache
in
his
torn
heart
.
``
Love
Ivan
!
''
--
he
suddenly
*NL*
recalled
Mitya
's
words
.
And
he
was
going
to
Ivan
.
He
badly
wanted
to
see
*NL*
Ivan
all
day
.
He
was
as
much
worried
about
Ivan
as
about
Mitya
,
and
more
*NL*
than
ever
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
V.
Not
You
,
Not
You
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
to
Ivan
he
had
to
pass
the
house
where
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
*NL*
living
.
There
was
light
in
the
windows
.
He
suddenly
stopped
and
resolved
*NL*
to
go
in
.
He
had
not
seen
Katerina
Ivanovna
for
more
than
a
week
.
But
now
*NL*
it
struck
him
that
Ivan
might
be
with
her
,
especially
on
the
eve
of
the
*NL*
terrible
day
.
Ringing
,
and
mounting
the
staircase
,
which
was
dimly
lighted
*NL*
by
a
Chinese
lantern
,
he
saw
a
man
coming
down
,
and
as
they
met
,
he
*NL*
recognized
him
as
his
brother
.
So
he
was
just
coming
from
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
only
you
,
''
said
Ivan
dryly
.
``
Well
,
good-by
!
You
are
going
to
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
advise
you
to
;
she
's
upset
and
you
'll
upset
her
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
door
was
instantly
flung
open
above
,
and
a
voice
cried
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
have
you
come
from
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
been
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
sent
me
any
message
?
Come
up
,
Alyosha
,
and
you
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
*NL*
you
must
come
back
,
you
must
.
Do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
a
peremptory
note
in
Katya
's
voice
that
Ivan
,
after
a
*NL*
moment
's
hesitation
,
made
up
his
mind
to
go
back
with
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
listening
,
''
he
murmured
angrily
to
himself
,
but
Alyosha
heard
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
my
keeping
my
greatcoat
on
,
''
said
Ivan
,
going
into
the
drawing
-
*NL*
room
.
``
I
wo
n't
sit
down
.
I
wo
n't
stay
more
than
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
''
said
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
though
she
*NL*
remained
standing
.
She
had
changed
very
little
during
this
time
,
but
there
*NL*
was
an
ominous
gleam
in
her
dark
eyes
.
Alyosha
remembered
afterwards
that
*NL*
she
had
struck
him
as
particularly
handsome
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
ask
you
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
thing
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
,
``
that
*NL*
you
would
spare
yourself
and
say
nothing
at
the
trial
of
what
''
-LRB-
he
was
a
*NL*
little
confused
-RRB-
''
...
passed
between
you
...
at
the
time
of
your
first
*NL*
acquaintance
...
in
that
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
I
bowed
down
to
the
ground
for
that
money
!
''
She
broke
into
a
*NL*
bitter
laugh
.
``
Why
,
is
he
afraid
for
me
or
for
himself
?
He
asks
me
to
*NL*
spare
--
whom
?
Him
or
myself
?
Tell
me
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
watched
her
intently
,
trying
to
understand
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
yourself
and
him
,
''
he
answered
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
''
she
snapped
out
maliciously
,
and
she
suddenly
*NL*
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
me
yet
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
''
she
said
menacingly
.
``
And
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
myself
yet
.
Perhaps
you
'll
want
to
trample
me
under
foot
after
*NL*
my
examination
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
give
your
evidence
honorably
,
''
said
Alyosha
;
``
that
's
all
that
's
*NL*
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
are
often
dishonorable
,
''
she
snarled
.
``
Only
an
hour
ago
I
was
*NL*
thinking
I
felt
afraid
to
touch
that
monster
...
as
though
he
were
a
*NL*
reptile
...
but
no
,
he
is
still
a
human
being
to
me
!
But
did
he
do
it
?
Is
*NL*
he
the
murderer
?
''
she
cried
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
hysterically
,
turning
*NL*
quickly
to
Ivan
.
Alyosha
saw
at
once
that
she
had
asked
Ivan
that
question
*NL*
before
,
perhaps
only
a
moment
before
he
came
in
,
and
not
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
but
for
the
hundredth
,
and
that
they
had
ended
by
quarreling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
see
Smerdyakov
...
It
was
you
,
you
who
persuaded
me
that
he
*NL*
murdered
his
father
.
It
's
only
you
I
believed
!
''
she
continued
,
still
*NL*
addressing
Ivan
.
He
gave
her
a
sort
of
strained
smile
.
Alyosha
started
at
*NL*
her
tone
.
He
had
not
suspected
such
familiar
intimacy
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
enough
,
anyway
,
''
Ivan
cut
short
the
conversation
.
``
I
am
*NL*
going
.
I
'll
come
to-morrow
.
''
And
turning
at
once
,
he
walked
out
of
the
*NL*
room
and
went
straight
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
imperious
gesture
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
seized
Alyosha
by
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
him
!
Overtake
him
!
Do
n't
leave
him
alone
for
a
minute
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
in
a
hurried
whisper
.
``
He
's
mad
!
Do
n't
you
know
that
he
's
mad
?
He
is
in
a
*NL*
fever
,
nervous
fever
.
The
doctor
told
me
so
.
Go
,
run
after
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
jumped
up
and
ran
after
Ivan
,
who
was
not
fifty
paces
ahead
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
He
turned
quickly
on
Alyosha
,
seeing
that
he
was
*NL*
running
after
him
.
``
She
told
you
to
catch
me
up
,
because
I
'm
mad
.
I
know
*NL*
it
all
by
heart
,
''
he
added
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
mistaken
,
of
course
;
but
she
is
right
that
you
are
ill
,
''
said
*NL*
Alyosha
.
``
I
was
looking
at
your
face
just
now
.
You
look
very
ill
,
Ivan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
walked
on
without
stopping
.
Alyosha
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
how
people
do
go
out
of
their
*NL*
mind
?
''
Ivan
asked
in
a
voice
suddenly
quiet
,
without
a
trace
of
*NL*
irritation
,
with
a
note
of
the
simplest
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
I
suppose
there
are
all
kinds
of
insanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
one
observe
that
one
's
going
mad
oneself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
one
ca
n't
see
oneself
clearly
in
such
circumstances
,
''
Alyosha
*NL*
answered
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
paused
for
half
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
talk
to
me
,
please
change
the
subject
,
''
he
said
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
while
I
think
of
it
,
I
have
a
letter
for
you
,
''
said
Alyosha
timidly
,
*NL*
and
he
took
Lise
's
note
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Ivan
.
They
were
*NL*
just
under
a
lamp-post
.
Ivan
recognized
the
handwriting
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
from
that
little
demon
!
''
he
laughed
maliciously
,
and
,
without
opening
*NL*
the
envelope
,
he
tore
it
into
bits
and
threw
it
in
the
air
.
The
bits
were
*NL*
scattered
by
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
sixteen
yet
,
I
believe
,
and
already
offering
herself
,
''
he
said
*NL*
contemptuously
,
striding
along
the
street
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
offering
herself
?
''
exclaimed
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
wanton
women
offer
themselves
,
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
,
Ivan
,
how
can
you
?
''
Alyosha
cried
warmly
,
in
a
grieved
*NL*
voice
.
``
She
is
a
child
;
you
are
insulting
a
child
!
She
is
ill
;
she
is
very
*NL*
ill
,
too
.
She
is
on
the
verge
of
insanity
,
too
,
perhaps
...
I
had
hoped
to
*NL*
hear
something
from
you
...
that
would
save
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
hear
nothing
from
me
.
If
she
is
a
child
I
am
not
her
nurse

Be
*NL*
quiet
,
Alexey
.
Do
n't
go
on
about
her
.
I
am
not
even
thinking
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
again
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
be
praying
all
night
now
to
the
Mother
of
God
to
show
her
how
to
*NL*
act
to-morrow
at
the
trial
,

he
said
sharply
and
angrily
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
...
you
mean
Katerina
Ivanovna

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Whether
she
's
to
save
Mitya
or
ruin
him

She
'll
pray
for
light
from

above

She
ca
n't
make
up
her
mind
for
herself

you
see
.
She
has
not
had
*NL*
time
to
decide
yet
.
She
takes
me
for
her
nurse

She
wants
me
to
sing
*NL*
lullabies
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
loves
you

said
Alyosha
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
;
but
I
am
not
very
keen
on
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
suffering
.
Why
do
you
...
sometimes
say
things
to
her
that
give
*NL*
her
hope
?

Alyosha
went
on
,
with
timid
reproach
.
``
I
know
that
you
've
given
*NL*
her
hope
.
Forgive
me
for
speaking
to
you
like
this
,

he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
behave
to
her
as
I
ought
--
break
off
altogether
and
tell
her
so
*NL*
straight
out
,
''
said
Ivan
,
irritably
.
``
I
must
wait
till
sentence
is
passed
*NL*
on
the
murderer

If
I
break
off
with
her
now

she
will
avenge
herself
on
*NL*
me
by
ruining
that
scoundrel
to-morrow
at
the
trial
,
for
she
hates
him
and
*NL*
knows
she
hates
him

It
's
all
a
lie
--
lie
upon
lie
!
As
long
as
I
do
n't
break
*NL*
off
with
her
,
she
goes
on
hoping

she
wo

how
I

to
get
him
out
of
trouble

If

that
damned
verdict

*NL*
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
``
murderer
''
and
``
monster
''
echoed
painfully
in
Alyosha
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
she
ruin
Mitya
?
''
he
asked
,
pondering
on
Ivan
's
words
.
``
What
*NL*
evidence
can
she
give
that
would
ruin
Mitya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
that
yet

She
's
got
a
document
in
her
hands

in
Mitya

*NL*
own
writing
,
that
proves
conclusively
that
he
did
murder
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
impossible

cried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
impossible

I

read
it
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

be
such
a

Alyosha
repeated
warmly
.
``
There

because
he

It

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
suddenly
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
the
murderer
then
,
according
to
you
?
''
he
asked
,
with
apparent
*NL*
coldness
.
There
was
even
a
supercilious
note
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
who
,
''
Alyosha
pronounced
in
a
low
,
penetrating
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
You
mean
the
myth
about
that
crazy
idiot
,
the
epileptic
,
*NL*
Smerdyakov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
suddenly
felt
himself
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
who
,
''
broke
helplessly
from
him
.
He
could
scarcely
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Who
?
''
Ivan
cried
almost
fiercely
.
All
his
restraint
suddenly
*NL*
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
know
one
thing
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
,
still
almost
in
a
whisper
,
''
_
it
*NL*
was
n't
you
_
killed
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Not

!
What
do

by
`

Ivan
was
thunderstruck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
you
killed
father
,
not
you
!
''
Alyosha
repeated
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
lasted
for
half
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
did
n't
.
Are
you
raving
?
''
said
Ivan
,
with
a
pale
,
distorted
*NL*
smile
.
His
eyes
were
riveted
on
Alyosha
.
They
were
standing
again
under
a
*NL*
lamp-post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Ivan
.
You
've
told
yourself
several
times
that
you
are
the
murderer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
I
say
so
?
I
was
in
Moscow
...
When
have
I
said
so
?
''
Ivan
*NL*
faltered
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
said
so
to
yourself
many
times
,
when
you
've
been
alone
during
*NL*
these
two
dreadful
months
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
softly
and
distinctly
as
*NL*
before
.
Yet
he
was
speaking
now
,
as
it
were
,
not
of
himself
,
not
of
his
*NL*
own
will
,
but
obeying
some
irresistible
command
.
``
You
have
accused
*NL*
yourself
and
have
confessed
to
yourself
that
you
are
the
murderer
and
no
*NL*
one
else
.
But
you
did
n't
do
it
:
you
are
mistaken
:
you
are
not
the
*NL*
murderer
.
Do
you
hear
?
It
was
not
you
!
God
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
.
The
silence
lasted
a
whole
long
minute
.
They
were
*NL*
both
standing
still
,
gazing
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
They
were
both
pale
.
*NL*
Suddenly
Ivan
began
trembling
all
over
,
and
clutched
Alyosha
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
in
my
room
!
''
he
whispered
hoarsely
.
``
You
've
been
there
at
*NL*
night
,
when
he
came
...
Confess
...
have
you
seen
him
,
have
you
seen
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
--
Mitya
?
''
Alyosha
asked
,
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
him
,
damn
the
monster
!
''
Ivan
shouted
,
in
a
frenzy
.
``
Do
you
know
that
*NL*
he
visits
me
?
How
did
you
find
out
?
Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
_
he
_
!
I
do
n't
know
whom
you
are
talking
about
,
''
Alyosha
faltered
,
*NL*
beginning
to
be
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
do
know
...
or
how
could
you
--
?
It
's
impossible
that
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
seemed
to
check
himself
.
He
stood
still
and
seemed
to
reflect
.
*NL*
A
strange
grin
contorted
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
Alyosha
began
again
,
in
a
shaking
voice
,
``
I
have
said
this
to
*NL*
you
,
because
you
'll
believe
my
word
,
I
know
that
.
I
tell
you
once
and
for
*NL*
all
,
it
's
not
you
.
You
hear
,
once
for
all
!
God
has
put
it
into
my
heart
to
*NL*
say
this
to
you
,
even
though
it
may
make
you
hate
me
from
this
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
now
Ivan
had
apparently
regained
his
self-control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
cold
smile
,
``
I
ca
n't
endure
*NL*
prophets
and
epileptics
--
messengers
from
God
especially
--
and
you
know
that
*NL*
only
too
well
.
I
break
off
all
relations
with
you
from
this
moment
and
*NL*
probably
for
ever
.
I
beg
you
to
leave
me
at
this
turning
.
It
's
the
way
to
*NL*
your
lodgings
,
too
.
You
'd
better
be
particularly
careful
not
to
come
to
me
*NL*
to-day
!
Do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
walked
on
with
a
firm
step
,
not
looking
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
Alyosha
called
after
him
,
``
if
anything
happens
to
you
to-day
,
*NL*
turn
to
me
before
any
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Ivan
made
no
reply
.
Alyosha
stood
under
the
lamp-post
at
the
cross
*NL*
roads
,
till
Ivan
had
vanished
into
the
darkness
.
Then
he
turned
and
walked
*NL*
slowly
homewards
.
Both
Alyosha
and
Ivan
were
living
in
lodgings
;
neither
*NL*
of
them
was
willing
to
live
in
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
empty
house
.
Alyosha
*NL*
had
a
furnished
room
in
the
house
of
some
working
people
.
Ivan
lived
some
*NL*
distance
from
him
.
He
had
taken
a
roomy
and
fairly
comfortable
lodge
*NL*
attached
to
a
fine
house
that
belonged
to
a
well-to-do
lady
,
the
widow
of
*NL*
an
official
.
But
his
only
attendant
was
a
deaf
and
rheumatic
old
crone
who
*NL*
went
to
bed
at
six
o'clock
every
evening
and
got
up
at
six
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Ivan
had
become
remarkably
indifferent
to
his
comforts
of
late
,
and
very
*NL*
fond
of
being
alone
.
He
did
everything
for
himself
in
the
one
room
he
*NL*
lived
in
,
and
rarely
entered
any
of
the
other
rooms
in
his
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
gate
of
the
house
and
had
his
hand
on
the
bell
,
when
he
*NL*
suddenly
stopped
.
He
felt
that
he
was
trembling
all
over
with
anger
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
let
go
of
the
bell
,
turned
back
with
a
curse
,
and
walked
with
*NL*
rapid
steps
in
the
opposite
direction
.
He
walked
a
mile
and
a
half
to
a
*NL*
tiny
,
slanting
,
wooden
house
,
almost
a
hut
,
where
Marya
Kondratyevna
,
the
*NL*
neighbor
who
used
to
come
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
kitchen
for
soup
and
to
*NL*
whom
Smerdyakov
had
once
sung
his
songs
and
played
on
the
guitar
,
was
now
*NL*
lodging
.
She
had
sold
their
little
house
,
and
was
now
living
here
with
her
*NL*
mother
.
Smerdyakov
,
who
was
ill
--
almost
dying
--
had
been
with
them
ever
since
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
death
.
It
was
to
him
Ivan
was
going
now
,
drawn
by
a
*NL*
sudden
and
irresistible
prompting
.

*NL*
Chapter
VI
.
The
First
Interview
With
Smerdyakov
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
third
time
that
Ivan
had
been
to
see
Smerdyakov
since
his
*NL*
return
from
Moscow
.
The
first
time
he
had
seen
him
and
talked
to
him
was
*NL*
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
,
then
he
had
visited
him
once
more
,
a
*NL*
fortnight
later
.
But
his
visits
had
ended
with
that
second
one
,
so
that
it
*NL*
was
now
over
a
month
since
he
had
seen
him
.
And
he
had
scarcely
heard
*NL*
anything
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
had
only
returned
five
days
after
his
father
's
death
,
so
that
he
was
*NL*
not
present
at
the
funeral
,
which
took
place
the
day
before
he
came
back
.
*NL*
The
cause
of
his
delay
was
that
Alyosha
,
not
knowing
his
Moscow
address
,
*NL*
had
to
apply
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
to
telegraph
to
him
,
and
she
,
not
*NL*
knowing
his
address
either
,
telegraphed
to
her
sister
and
aunt
,
reckoning
*NL*
on
Ivan
's
going
to
see
them
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
Moscow
.
But
he
did
*NL*
not
go
to
them
till
four
days
after
his
arrival
.
When
he
got
the
telegram
,
*NL*
he
had
,
of
course
,
set
off
post-haste
to
our
town
.
The
first
to
meet
him
*NL*
was
Alyosha
,
and
Ivan
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
,
in
opposition
to
*NL*
the
general
opinion
of
the
town
,
he
refused
to
entertain
a
suspicion
*NL*
against
Mitya
,
and
spoke
openly
of
Smerdyakov
as
the
murderer
.
Later
on
,
*NL*
after
seeing
the
police
captain
and
the
prosecutor
,
and
hearing
the
*NL*
details
of
the
charge
and
the
arrest
,
he
was
still
more
surprised
at
*NL*
Alyosha
,
and
ascribed
his
opinion
only
to
his
exaggerated
brotherly
*NL*
feeling
and
sympathy
with
Mitya
,
of
whom
Alyosha
,
as
Ivan
knew
,
was
very
*NL*
fond
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
way
,
let
us
say
a
word
or
two
of
Ivan
's
feeling
to
his
brother
*NL*
Dmitri
.
He
positively
disliked
him
;
at
most
,
felt
sometimes
a
compassion
*NL*
for
him
,
and
even
that
was
mixed
with
great
contempt
,
almost
repugnance
.
*NL*
Mitya
's
whole
personality
,
even
his
appearance
,
was
extremely
unattractive
*NL*
to
him
.
Ivan
looked
with
indignation
on
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
love
for
his
*NL*
brother
.
Yet
he
went
to
see
Mitya
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
,
and
*NL*
that
interview
,
far
from
shaking
Ivan
's
belief
in
his
guilt
,
positively
*NL*
strengthened
it
.
He
found
his
brother
agitated
,
nervously
excited
.
Mitya
*NL*
had
been
talkative
,
but
very
absent-minded
and
incoherent
.
He
used
violent
*NL*
language
,
accused
Smerdyakov
,
and
was
fearfully
muddled
.
He
talked
*NL*
principally
about
the
three
thousand
roubles
,
which
he
said
had
been
*NL*
``
stolen
''
from
him
by
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
money
was
mine
,
it
was
my
money
,
''
Mitya
kept
repeating
.
``
Even
if
I
*NL*
had
stolen
it
,
I
should
have
had
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hardly
contested
the
evidence
against
him
,
and
if
he
tried
to
turn
a
*NL*
fact
to
his
advantage
,
it
was
in
an
absurd
and
incoherent
way
.
He
hardly
*NL*
seemed
to
wish
to
defend
himself
to
Ivan
or
any
one
else
.
Quite
the
*NL*
contrary
,
he
was
angry
and
proudly
scornful
of
the
charges
against
him
;
he
*NL*
was
continually
firing
up
and
abusing
every
one
.
He
only
laughed
*NL*
contemptuously
at
Grigory
's
evidence
about
the
open
door
,
and
declared
*NL*
that
it
was
``
the
devil
that
opened
it
.
''
But
he
could
not
bring
forward
any
*NL*
coherent
explanation
of
the
fact
.
He
even
succeeded
in
insulting
Ivan
*NL*
during
their
first
interview
,
telling
him
sharply
that
it
was
not
for
*NL*
people
who
declared
that
``
everything
was
lawful
,
''
to
suspect
and
question
*NL*
him
.
Altogether
he
was
anything
but
friendly
with
Ivan
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
Immediately
after
that
interview
with
Mitya
,
Ivan
went
for
the
first
time
*NL*
to
see
Smerdyakov
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
railway
train
on
his
way
from
Moscow
,
he
kept
thinking
of
*NL*
Smerdyakov
and
of
his
last
conversation
with
him
on
the
evening
before
he
*NL*
went
away
.
Many
things
seemed
to
him
puzzling
and
suspicious
.
But
when
he
*NL*
gave
his
evidence
to
the
investigating
lawyer
Ivan
said
nothing
,
for
the
*NL*
time
,
of
that
conversation
.
He
put
that
off
till
he
had
seen
Smerdyakov
,
*NL*
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Herzenstube
and
Varvinsky
,
the
doctor
he
met
in
the
hospital
,
*NL*
confidently
asserted
in
reply
to
Ivan
's
persistent
questions
,
that
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
epileptic
attack
was
unmistakably
genuine
,
and
were
surprised
*NL*
indeed
at
Ivan
asking
whether
he
might
not
have
been
shamming
on
the
day
*NL*
of
the
catastrophe
.
They
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
attack
was
an
*NL*
exceptional
one
,
the
fits
persisting
and
recurring
several
times
,
so
that
*NL*
the
patient
's
life
was
positively
in
danger
,
and
it
was
only
now
,
after
*NL*
they
had
applied
remedies
,
that
they
could
assert
with
confidence
that
the
*NL*
patient
would
survive
.
``
Though
it
might
well
be
,
''
added
Doctor
*NL*
Herzenstube
,
``
that
his
reason
would
be
impaired
for
a
considerable
period
,
*NL*
if
not
permanently
.
''
On
Ivan
's
asking
impatiently
whether
that
meant
that
*NL*
he
was
now
mad
,
they
told
him
that
this
was
not
yet
the
case
,
in
the
full
*NL*
sense
of
the
word
,
but
that
certain
abnormalities
were
perceptible
.
Ivan
*NL*
decided
to
find
out
for
himself
what
those
abnormalities
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hospital
he
was
at
once
allowed
to
see
the
patient
.
Smerdyakov
was
*NL*
lying
on
a
truckle-bed
in
a
separate
ward
.
There
was
only
one
other
bed
in
*NL*
the
room
,
and
in
it
lay
a
tradesman
of
the
town
,
swollen
with
dropsy
,
who
*NL*
was
obviously
almost
dying
;
he
could
be
no
hindrance
to
their
*NL*
conversation
.
Smerdyakov
grinned
uncertainly
on
seeing
Ivan
,
and
for
the
*NL*
first
instant
seemed
nervous
.
So
at
least
Ivan
fancied
.
But
that
was
only
*NL*
momentary
.
For
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
struck
,
on
the
contrary
,
by
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
composure
.
From
the
first
glance
Ivan
had
no
doubt
that
he
*NL*
was
very
ill
.
He
was
very
weak
;
he
spoke
slowly
,
seeming
to
move
his
*NL*
tongue
with
difficulty
;
he
was
much
thinner
and
sallower
.
Throughout
the
*NL*
interview
,
which
lasted
twenty
minutes
,
he
kept
complaining
of
headache
*NL*
and
of
pain
in
all
his
limbs
.
His
thin
emasculate
face
seemed
to
have
*NL*
become
so
tiny
;
his
hair
was
ruffled
,
and
his
crest
of
curls
in
front
*NL*
stood
up
in
a
thin
tuft
.
But
in
the
left
eye
,
which
was
screwed
up
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
insinuating
something
,
Smerdyakov
showed
himself
unchanged
.
*NL*
``
It
's
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
clever
man
.
''
Ivan
was
reminded
of
*NL*
that
at
once
.
He
sat
down
on
the
stool
at
his
feet
.
Smerdyakov
,
with
*NL*
painful
effort
,
shifted
his
position
in
bed
,
but
he
was
not
the
first
to
*NL*
speak
.
He
remained
dumb
,
and
did
not
even
look
much
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
talk
to
me
?
''
asked
Ivan
.
``
I
wo
n't
tire
you
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
can
,
''
mumbled
Smerdyakov
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
``
Has
your
honor
*NL*
been
back
long
?
''
he
added
patronizingly
,
as
though
encouraging
a
nervous
*NL*
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
arrived
to-day
...
To
see
the
mess
you
are
in
here
.
''
Smerdyakov
*NL*
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
sigh
?
You
knew
of
it
all
along
,
''
Ivan
blurted
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
stolidly
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
help
knowing
?
It
was
clear
beforehand
.
But
how
could
I
tell
*NL*
it
would
turn
out
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
turn
out
?
Do
n't
prevaricate
!
You
've
foretold
you
'd
have
a
fit
;
*NL*
on
the
way
down
to
the
cellar
,
you
know
.
You
mentioned
the
very
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
said
so
at
the
examination
yet
?
''
Smerdyakov
queried
with
*NL*
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
felt
suddenly
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
yet
,
but
I
certainly
shall
.
You
must
explain
a
great
deal
*NL*
to
me
,
my
man
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
I
am
not
going
to
let
you
play
with
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
play
with
you
,
when
I
put
my
whole
trust
in
you
,
as
in
God
*NL*
Almighty
?
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
with
the
same
composure
,
only
for
a
moment
*NL*
closing
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
''
began
Ivan
,
``
I
know
that
epileptic
fits
ca
n't
be
*NL*
told
beforehand
.
I
've
inquired
;
do
n't
try
and
take
me
in
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
foretell
the
day
and
the
hour
.
How
was
it
you
told
me
the
day
and
the
hour
*NL*
beforehand
,
and
about
the
cellar
,
too
?
How
could
you
tell
that
you
would
*NL*
fall
down
the
cellar
stairs
in
a
fit
,
if
you
did
n't
sham
a
fit
on
*NL*
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
to
go
to
the
cellar
anyway
,
several
times
a
day
,
indeed
,
''
*NL*
Smerdyakov
drawled
deliberately
.
``
I
fell
from
the
garret
just
in
the
same
*NL*
way
a
year
ago
.
It
's
quite
true
you
ca
n't
tell
the
day
and
hour
of
a
fit
*NL*
beforehand
,
but
you
can
always
have
a
presentiment
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
foretell
the
day
and
the
hour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
regard
to
my
epilepsy
,
sir
,
you
had
much
better
inquire
of
the
doctors
*NL*
here
.
You
can
ask
them
whether
it
was
a
real
fit
or
a
sham
;
it
's
no
use
my
*NL*
saying
any
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
cellar
?
How
could
you
know
beforehand
of
the
cellar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
seem
able
to
get
over
that
cellar
!
As
I
was
going
down
to
the
*NL*
cellar
,
I
was
in
terrible
dread
and
doubt
.
What
frightened
me
most
was
*NL*
losing
you
and
being
left
without
defense
in
all
the
world
.
So
I
went
down
*NL*
into
the
cellar
thinking
,
`
Here
,
it
'll
come
on
directly
,
it
'll
strike
me
*NL*
down
directly
,
shall
I
fall
?
'
And
it
was
through
this
fear
that
I
suddenly
*NL*
felt
the
spasm
that
always
comes
...
and
so
I
went
flying
.
All
that
and
*NL*
all
my
previous
conversation
with
you
at
the
gate
the
evening
before
,
when
*NL*
I
told
you
how
frightened
I
was
and
spoke
of
the
cellar
,
I
told
all
that
*NL*
to
Doctor
Herzenstube
and
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
the
investigating
lawyer
,
*NL*
and
it
's
all
been
written
down
in
the
protocol
.
And
the
doctor
here
,
Mr.
*NL*
Varvinsky
,
maintained
to
all
of
them
that
it
was
just
the
thought
of
it
*NL*
brought
it
on
,
the
apprehension
that
I
might
fall
.
It
was
just
then
that
*NL*
the
fit
seized
me
.
And
so
they
've
written
it
down
,
that
it
's
just
how
it
*NL*
must
have
happened
,
simply
from
my
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
finished
,
Smerdyakov
drew
a
deep
breath
,
as
though
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
said
all
that
in
your
evidence
?
''
said
Ivan
,
somewhat
taken
*NL*
aback
.
He
had
meant
to
frighten
him
with
the
threat
of
repeating
their
*NL*
conversation
,
and
it
appeared
that
Smerdyakov
had
already
reported
it
all
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
to
be
afraid
of
?
Let
them
write
down
the
whole
truth
,
''
*NL*
Smerdyakov
pronounced
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
told
them
every
word
of
our
conversation
at
the
gate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
to
say
every
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
tell
them
that
you
can
sham
fits
,
as
you
boasted
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
tell
them
that
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
now
,
why
did
you
send
me
then
to
Tchermashnya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
you
'd
go
away
to
Moscow
;
Tchermashnya
is
nearer
,
anyway

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lying
;
you
suggested
my
going
away
yourself

you
told
me
to
get

out
of
the
way
of
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
simply
out
of
affection
and
my
sincere
devotion
to
you
,
*NL*
foreseeing
trouble
in
the
house

to
spare
you
.
Only
I
wanted
to
spare
*NL*
myself
even
more
.
That
's
why
I
told
you
to
get
out
of
harm
's
way
,
that
you
*NL*
might
understand
that
there
would
be
trouble
in
the
house

and
would
*NL*
remain
at
home
to
protect
your
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
said
it
more
directly

blockhead

Ivan
suddenly
fired
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
have
said
it
more
directly
then
?
It
was
simply
my
fear
that
*NL*
made
me
speak

and
you
might
have
been
angry
,
too

I
might
well
have
been
*NL*
apprehensive
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
would
make
a
scene
and
carry
away
*NL*
that
money
,
for
he
considered
it
as
good
as
his
own
;
but
who
could
tell
*NL*
that
it
would
end
in
a
murder
like
this
?
I
thought
that
he
would
only
*NL*
carry
off
the
three
thousand
that
lay
under
the
master
's
mattress
in
the
*NL*
envelope
,

you
see
,
he
's
murdered
him

How
could
you
guess
it
either
,
*NL*
sir
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
say
yourself
that
it
could
n't
be
guessed

how
could
I
have

guessed
and
stayed
at
home
?
You
contradict
yourself
!
''
said
Ivan
,
*NL*
pondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
guessed
from
my
sending
you
to
Tchermashnya
and
not
to
*NL*
Moscow
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
guess
it
from
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
seemed
much
exhausted
,
and
again
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
guessed
from
the
fact

my
asking
you
not
to
go

to
Tchermashnya
,
that
I
wanted
to
have
you
nearer

*NL*
Moscow
's
a
long
way
off
,
and
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
,
knowing
you
are
not
far
*NL*
off
,
would
not
be
so
bold
.
And
if
anything
had
happened
,
you
might
have
*NL*
come
to
protect
me
,
too
,
for
I
warned
you
of
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
's
*NL*
illness
,

that
I
was
afraid
of
having
a
fit

when
I
explained
those

knocks
to
you

by
means
of
which
one
could
go
in

guess
yourself
that
he
would
be
sure
to
do
something
,
and
so
would
n't
go
*NL*
to
Tchermashnya
even
,
but
would
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talks
very
coherently
,
''
thought
Ivan
,
``
though
he
does
mumble
;
what
's
*NL*
the
derangement
of
his
faculties
that
Herzenstube
talked
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
cunning
with
me
,
damn
you
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
getting
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
at
the
time
that
you
quite
guessed
,
''
Smerdyakov
parried
*NL*
with
the
simplest
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
guessed
,
I
should
have
stayed
,
''
cried
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
thought
that
it
was
because
you
guessed
,
that
you
went
away
in
*NL*
such
a
hurry
,
only
to
get
out
of
trouble
,
only
to
run
away
and
save
*NL*
yourself
in
your
fright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
that
every
one
is
as
great
a
coward
as
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
I
thought
you
were
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
ought
to
have
guessed
,
''
Ivan
said
in
agitation
;
``
and
I
did
*NL*
guess
there
was
some
mischief
brewing
on
your
part
...
only
you
are
lying
,
*NL*
you
are
lying
again
,
''
he
cried
,
suddenly
recollecting
.
``
Do
you
remember
*NL*
how
you
went
up
to
the
carriage
and
said
to
me
,
`
It
's
always
worth
while
*NL*
speaking
to
a
clever
man
'
?
So
you
were
glad
I
went
away
,
since
you
praised
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
sighed
again
and
again
.
A
trace
of
color
came
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
was
pleased
,
''
he
articulated
rather
breathlessly
,
``
it
was
simply
*NL*
because
you
agreed
not
to
go
to
Moscow
,
but
to
Tchermashnya
.
For
it
was
*NL*
nearer
,
anyway
.
Only
when
I
said
these
words
to
you
,
it
was
not
by
way
of
*NL*
praise
,
but
of
reproach
.
You
did
n't
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
reproach
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
foreseeing
such
a
calamity
you
deserted
your
own
father
,
and
*NL*
would
not
protect
us
,
for
I
might
have
been
taken
up
any
time
for
stealing
*NL*
that
three
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
you
!
''
Ivan
swore
again
.
``
Stay
,
did
you
tell
the
prosecutor
and
the
*NL*
investigating
lawyer
about
those
knocks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
them
everything
just
as
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
wondered
inwardly
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
thought
of
anything
then
,
''
he
began
again
,
``
it
was
solely
of
some
*NL*
wickedness
on
your
part
.
Dmitri
might
kill
him
,
but
that
he
would
steal
--
I
*NL*
did
not
believe
that
then
...
But
I
was
prepared
for
any
wickedness
from
*NL*
you
.
You
told
me
yourself
you
could
sham
a
fit
.
What
did
you
say
that
*NL*
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
just
through
my
simplicity
,
and
I
never
have
shammed
a
fit
on
*NL*
purpose
in
my
life
.
And
I
only
said
so
then
to
boast
to
you
.
It
was
just
*NL*
foolishness
.
I
liked
you
so
much
then
,
and
was
open-hearted
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
directly
accuses
you
of
the
murder
and
theft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
is
left
for
him
to
do
?
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
with
a
bitter
grin
.
*NL*
``
And
who
will
believe
him
with
all
the
proofs
against
him
?
Grigory
*NL*
Vassilyevitch
saw
the
door
open
.
What
can
he
say
after
that
?
But
never
*NL*
mind
him
!
He
is
trembling
to
save
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slowly
ceased
speaking
;
then
suddenly
,
as
though
on
reflection
,
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
look
here
again
.
He
wants
to
throw
it
on
me
and
make
out
that
it
is
*NL*
the
work
of
my
hands
--
I
've
heard
that
already
.
But
as
to
my
being
clever
at
*NL*
shamming
a
fit
:
should
I
have
told
you
beforehand
that
I
could
sham
one
,
*NL*
if
I
really
had
had
such
a
design
against
your
father
?
If
I
had
been
*NL*
planning
such
a
murder
could
I
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
give
such
*NL*
evidence
against
myself
beforehand
?
And
to
his
son
,
too
!
Upon
my
word
!
Is
*NL*
that
likely
?
As
if
that
could
be
,
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
.
No
one
*NL*
hears
this
talk
of
ours
now
,
except
Providence
itself
,
and
if
you
were
to
*NL*
tell
of
it
to
the
prosecutor
and
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
you
might
defend
me
*NL*
completely
by
doing
so
,
for
who
would
be
likely
to
be
such
a
criminal
,
if
*NL*
he
is
so
open-hearted
beforehand
?
Any
one
can
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
and
Ivan
got
up
to
cut
short
the
conversation
,
struck
by
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
last
argument
.
``
I
do
n't
suspect
you
at
all
,
and
I
think
it
's
*NL*
absurd
,
indeed
,
to
suspect
you
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
grateful
to
you
for
*NL*
setting
my
mind
at
rest
.
Now
I
am
going
,
but
I
'll
come
again
.
Meanwhile
,
*NL*
good-by
.
Get
well
.
Is
there
anything
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
thankful
for
everything
.
Marfa
Ignatyevna
does
not
forget
me
,
*NL*
and
provides
me
anything
I
want
,
according
to
her
kindness
.
Good
people
*NL*
visit
me
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
.
But
I
sha
n't
say
anything
of
your
being
able
to
sham
a
fit
,
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
advise
you
to
,
either
,
''
something
made
Ivan
say
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
.
And
if
you
do
n't
speak
of
that
,
I
shall
say
nothing
*NL*
of
that
conversation
of
ours
at
the
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
happened
that
Ivan
went
out
,
and
only
when
he
had
gone
a
dozen
*NL*
steps
along
the
corridor
,
he
suddenly
felt
that
there
was
an
insulting
*NL*
significance
in
Smerdyakov
's
last
words
.
He
was
almost
on
the
point
of
*NL*
turning
back
,
but
it
was
only
a
passing
impulse
,
and
muttering
,
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
he
went
out
of
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
chief
feeling
was
one
of
relief
at
the
fact
that
it
was
not
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
but
Mitya
,
who
had
committed
the
murder
,
though
he
might
have
*NL*
been
expected
to
feel
the
opposite
.
He
did
not
want
to
analyze
the
reason
*NL*
for
this
feeling
,
and
even
felt
a
positive
repugnance
at
prying
into
his
*NL*
sensations
.
He
felt
as
though
he
wanted
to
make
haste
to
forget
something
.
*NL*
In
the
following
days
he
became
convinced
of
Mitya
's
guilt
,
as
he
got
to
*NL*
know
all
the
weight
of
evidence
against
him
.
There
was
evidence
of
people
*NL*
of
no
importance
,
Fenya
and
her
mother
,
for
instance
,
but
the
effect
of
it
*NL*
was
almost
overpowering
.
As
to
Perhotin
,
the
people
at
the
tavern
,
and
at
*NL*
Plotnikov
's
shop
,
as
well
as
the
witnesses
at
Mokroe
,
their
evidence
*NL*
seemed
conclusive
.
It
was
the
details
that
were
so
damning
.
The
secret
of
*NL*
the
knocks
impressed
the
lawyers
almost
as
much
as
Grigory
's
evidence
as
*NL*
to
the
open
door
.
Grigory
's
wife
,
Marfa
,
in
answer
to
Ivan
's
questions
,
*NL*
declared
that
Smerdyakov
had
been
lying
all
night
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
partition
wall
.
``
He
was
not
three
paces
from
our
bed
,
''
and
that
although
*NL*
she
was
a
sound
sleeper
she
waked
several
times
and
heard
him
moaning
,
``
He
*NL*
was
moaning
the
whole
time
,
moaning
continually
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Talking
to
Herzenstube
,
and
giving
it
as
his
opinion
that
Smerdyakov
was
*NL*
not
mad
,
but
only
rather
weak
,
Ivan
only
evoked
from
the
old
man
a
subtle
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
how
he
spends
his
time
now
?
''
he
asked
;
``
learning
lists
of
*NL*
French
words
by
heart
.
He
has
an
exercise-book
under
his
pillow
with
the
*NL*
French
words
written
out
in
Russian
letters
for
him
by
some
one
,
he
he
*NL*
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
ended
by
dismissing
all
doubts
.
He
could
not
think
of
Dmitri
without
*NL*
repulsion
.
Only
one
thing
was
strange
,
however
.
Alyosha
persisted
that
*NL*
Dmitri
was
not
the
murderer
,
and
that
``
in
all
probability
''
Smerdyakov
was
.
*NL*
Ivan
always
felt
that
Alyosha
's
opinion
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
,
and
so
*NL*
he
was
astonished
at
it
now
.
Another
thing
that
was
strange
was
that
*NL*
Alyosha
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
talk
about
Mitya
with
Ivan
,
that
he
*NL*
never
began
on
the
subject
and
only
answered
his
questions
.
This
,
too
,
*NL*
struck
Ivan
particularly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
very
much
preoccupied
at
that
time
with
something
quite
apart
*NL*
from
that
.
On
his
return
from
Moscow
,
he
abandoned
himself
hopelessly
to
*NL*
his
mad
and
consuming
passion
for
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
This
is
not
the
time
*NL*
to
begin
to
speak
of
this
new
passion
of
Ivan
's
,
which
left
its
mark
on
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
his
life
:
this
would
furnish
the
subject
for
another
*NL*
novel
,
which
I
may
perhaps
never
write
.
But
I
can
not
omit
to
mention
here
*NL*
that
when
Ivan
,
on
leaving
Katerina
Ivanovna
with
Alyosha
,
as
I
've
related
*NL*
already
,
told
him
,
``
I
am
not
keen
on
her
,
''
it
was
an
absolute
lie
:
he
*NL*
loved
her
madly
,
though
at
times
he
hated
her
so
that
he
might
have
*NL*
murdered
her
.
Many
causes
helped
to
bring
about
this
feeling
.
Shattered
by
*NL*
what
had
happened
with
Mitya
,
she
rushed
on
Ivan
's
return
to
meet
him
as
*NL*
her
one
salvation
.
She
was
hurt
,
insulted
and
humiliated
in
her
feelings
.
*NL*
And
here
the
man
had
come
back
to
her
,
who
had
loved
her
so
ardently
*NL*
before
-LRB-
oh
!
she
knew
that
very
well
-RRB-
,
and
whose
heart
and
intellect
she
*NL*
considered
so
superior
to
her
own
.
But
the
sternly
virtuous
girl
did
not
*NL*
abandon
herself
altogether
to
the
man
she
loved
,
in
spite
of
the
Karamazov
*NL*
violence
of
his
passions
and
the
great
fascination
he
had
for
her
.
She
was
*NL*
continually
tormented
at
the
same
time
by
remorse
for
having
deserted
*NL*
Mitya
,
and
in
moments
of
discord
and
violent
anger
-LRB-
and
they
were
*NL*
numerous
-RRB-
she
told
Ivan
so
plainly
.
This
was
what
he
had
called
to
Alyosha
*NL*
``
lies
upon
lies
.
''
There
was
,
of
course
,
much
that
was
false
in
it
,
and
*NL*
that
angered
Ivan
more
than
anything
...
But
of
all
this
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
,
in
fact
,
for
a
time
almost
forget
Smerdyakov
's
existence
,
and
yet
,
*NL*
a
fortnight
after
his
first
visit
to
him
,
he
began
to
be
haunted
by
the
*NL*
same
strange
thoughts
as
before
.
It
's
enough
to
say
that
he
was
*NL*
continually
asking
himself
,
why
was
it
that
on
that
last
night
in
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
house
he
had
crept
out
on
to
the
stairs
like
a
thief
and
*NL*
listened
to
hear
what
his
father
was
doing
below
?
Why
had
he
recalled
that
*NL*
afterwards
with
repulsion
?
Why
next
morning
,
had
he
been
suddenly
so
*NL*
depressed
on
the
journey
?
Why
,
as
he
reached
Moscow
,
had
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
I
am
a
scoundrel
''
?
And
now
he
almost
fancied
that
these
*NL*
tormenting
thoughts
would
make
him
even
forget
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
so
*NL*
completely
did
they
take
possession
of
him
again
.
It
was
just
after
*NL*
fancying
this
,
that
he
met
Alyosha
in
the
street
.
He
stopped
him
at
once
,
*NL*
and
put
a
question
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
when
Dmitri
burst
in
after
dinner
and
beat
father
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
I
told
you
in
the
yard
that
I
reserved
`
the
right
to
*NL*
desire
'
?
...
Tell
me
,
did
you
think
then
that
I
desired
father
's
death
or
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
think
so
,
''
answered
Alyosha
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
so
,
too
;
it
was
not
a
matter
of
guessing
.
But
did
n't
you
fancy
*NL*
then
that
what
I
wished
was
just
that
`
one
reptile
should
devour
another
'
;
*NL*
that
is
,
just
that
Dmitri
should
kill
father
,
and
as
soon
as
possible
...
*NL*
and
that
I
myself
was
even
prepared
to
help
to
bring
that
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
turned
rather
pale
,
and
looked
silently
into
his
brother
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
!
''
cried
Ivan
,
``
I
want
above
everything
to
know
what
you
thought
*NL*
then
.
I
want
the
truth
,
the
truth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
deep
breath
,
looking
angrily
at
Alyosha
before
his
answer
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
I
did
think
that
,
too
,
at
the
time
,
''
whispered
Alyosha
,
and
*NL*
he
did
not
add
one
softening
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
snapped
Ivan
,
and
,
leaving
Alyosha
,
he
went
quickly
on
his
way
.
*NL*
From
that
time
Alyosha
noticed
that
Ivan
began
obviously
to
avoid
him
and
*NL*
seemed
even
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
him
,
so
much
so
that
Alyosha
gave
*NL*
up
going
to
see
him
.
Immediately
after
that
meeting
with
him
,
Ivan
had
not
*NL*
gone
home
,
but
went
straight
to
Smerdyakov
again

had
been
discharged
from
the
hospital
.
Ivan
knew
*NL*
his
new
lodging
,
the
dilapidated
little
wooden
house
,
divided
in
two
by
a
*NL*
passage
on
one
side
of
which
lived
Marya
Kondratyevna
and
her
mother
,
and
*NL*
on
the
other
,
Smerdyakov
.
No
one
knew
on
what
terms
he
lived
with
them
,
*NL*
whether
as
a
friend
or
as
a
lodger
.
It
was
supposed
afterwards
that
he
had
*NL*
come
to
stay
with
them
as
Marya
Kondratyevna
's
betrothed
,
and
was
living
*NL*
there
for
a
time
without
paying
for
board
or
lodging
.
Both
mother
and
*NL*
daughter
had
the
greatest
respect
for
him
and
looked
upon
him
as
greatly
*NL*
superior
to
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
knocked
,
and
,
on
the
door
being
opened
,
went
straight
into
the
*NL*
passage
.
By
Marya
Kondratyevna
's
directions
he
went
straight
to
the
better
*NL*
room
on
the
left
,
occupied
by
Smerdyakov
.
There
was
a
tiled
stove
in
the
*NL*
room
and
it
was
extremely
hot
.
The
walls
were
gay
with
blue
paper
,
which
*NL*
was
a
good
deal
used
however
,
and
in
the
cracks
under
it
cockroaches
*NL*
swarmed
in
amazing
numbers
,
so
that
there
was
a
continual
rustling
from
*NL*
them
.
The
furniture
was
very
scanty
:
two
benches
against
each
wall
and
two
*NL*
chairs
by
the
table
.
The
table
of
plain
wood
was
covered
with
a
cloth
with
*NL*
pink
patterns
on
it
.
There
was
a
pot
of
geranium
on
each
of
the
two
little
*NL*
windows
.
In
the
corner
there
was
a
case
of
ikons
.
On
the
table
stood
a
*NL*
little
copper
samovar
with
many
dents
in
it
,
and
a
tray
with
two
cups
.
But
*NL*
Smerdyakov
had
finished
tea
and
the
samovar
was
out
.
He
was
sitting
at
the
*NL*
table
on
a
bench
.
He
was
looking
at
an
exercise-book
and
slowly
writing
*NL*
with
a
pen
.
There
was
a
bottle
of
ink
by
him
and
a
flat
iron
candlestick
,
*NL*
but
with
a
composite
candle
.
Ivan
saw
at
once
from
Smerdyakov
's
face
that
*NL*
he
had
completely
recovered
from
his
illness
.
His
face
was
fresher
,
*NL*
fuller
,
his
hair
stood
up
jauntily
in
front
,
and
was
plastered
down
at
the
*NL*
sides
.
He
was
sitting
in
a
parti-colored
,
wadded
dressing-gown
,
rather
*NL*
dirty
and
frayed
,
however
.
He
had
spectacles
on
his
nose
,
which
Ivan
had
*NL*
never
seen
him
wearing
before
.
This
trifling
circumstance
suddenly
*NL*
redoubled
Ivan
's
anger
:
``
A
creature
like
that
and
wearing
spectacles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
slowly
raised
his
head
and
looked
intently
at
his
visitor
*NL*
through
his
spectacles
;
then
he
slowly
took
them
off
and
rose
from
the
*NL*
bench
,
but
by
no
means
respectfully
,
almost
lazily
,
doing
the
least
*NL*
possible
required
by
common
civility
.
All
this
struck
Ivan
instantly
;
he
*NL*
took
it
all
in
and
noted
it
at
once
--
most
of
all
the
look
in
Smerdyakov
's
*NL*
eyes
,
positively
malicious
,
churlish
and
haughty
.
``
What
do
you
want
to
*NL*
intrude
for
?
''
it
seemed
to
say
;
``
we
settled
everything
then
;
why
have
you
*NL*
come
again
?
''
Ivan
could
scarcely
control
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hot
here
,
''
he
said
,
still
standing
,
and
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
off
your
coat
,
''
Smerdyakov
conceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
took
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
on
a
bench
with
trembling
hands
.
He
*NL*
took
a
chair
,
moved
it
quickly
to
the
table
and
sat
down
.
Smerdyakov
*NL*
managed
to
sit
down
on
his
bench
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
begin
with
,
are
we
alone
?
''
Ivan
asked
sternly
and
impulsively
.
``
Can
*NL*
they
overhear
us
in
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
can
hear
anything
.
You
've
seen
for
yourself
:
there
's
a
passage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
my
good
fellow
;
what
was
that
you
babbled
,
as
I
was
leaving
the
*NL*
hospital
,
that
if
I
said
nothing
about
your
faculty
of
shamming
fits
,
you
*NL*
would
n't
tell
the
investigating
lawyer
all
our
conversation
at
the
gate
?
*NL*
What
do
you
mean
by
_
all
_
?
What
could
you
mean
by
it
?
Were
you
threatening
*NL*
me
?
Have
I
entered
into
some
sort
of
compact
with
you
?
Do
you
suppose
I
am
*NL*
afraid
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
said
this
in
a
perfect
fury
,
giving
him
to
understand
with
obvious
*NL*
intention
that
he
scorned
any
subterfuge
or
indirectness
and
meant
to
show
*NL*
his
cards
.
Smerdyakov
's
eyes
gleamed
resentfully
,
his
left
eye
winked
,
and
*NL*
he
at
once
gave
his
answer
,
with
his
habitual
composure
and
deliberation
.
*NL*
``
You
want
to
have
everything
above-board
;
very
well
,
you
shall
have
it
,
''
*NL*
he
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
meant
then
,
and
this
is
why
I
said
that
,
that
you
,
knowing
*NL*
beforehand
of
this
murder
of
your
own
parent
,
left
him
to
his
fate
,
and
*NL*
that
people
might
n't
after
that
conclude
any
evil
about
your
feelings
and
*NL*
perhaps
of
something
else
,
too
--
that
's
what
I
promised
not
to
tell
the
*NL*
authorities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Smerdyakov
spoke
without
haste
and
obviously
controlling
himself
,
*NL*
yet
there
was
something
in
his
voice
,
determined
and
emphatic
,
resentful
*NL*
and
insolently
defiant
.
He
stared
impudently
at
Ivan
.
A
mist
passed
before
*NL*
Ivan
's
eyes
for
the
first
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
What
?
Are
you
out
of
your
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
perfectly
in
possession
of
all
my
faculties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
I
_
knew
_
of
the
murder
?
''
Ivan
cried
at
last
,
and
he
*NL*
brought
his
fist
violently
on
the
table
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
`
something
*NL*
else
,
too
'
?
Speak
,
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
silent
and
still
scanned
Ivan
with
the
same
insolent
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
you
stinking
rogue
,
what
is
that
`
something
else
,
too
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
`
something
else
'
I
meant
was
that
you
probably
,
too
,
were
very
*NL*
desirous
of
your
parent
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
jumped
up
and
struck
him
with
all
his
might
on
the
shoulder
,
so
that
*NL*
he
fell
back
against
the
wall
.
In
an
instant
his
face
was
bathed
in
tears
.
*NL*
Saying
,
``
It
's
a
shame
,
sir
,
to
strike
a
sick
man
,
''
he
dried
his
eyes
with
*NL*
a
very
dirty
blue
check
handkerchief
and
sank
into
quiet
weeping
.
A
minute
*NL*
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
!
Leave
off
,
''
Ivan
said
peremptorily
,
sitting
down
again
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
me
out
of
all
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
took
the
rag
from
his
eyes
.
Every
line
of
his
puckered
face
*NL*
reflected
the
insult
he
had
just
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
thought
then
,
you
scoundrel
,
that
together
with
Dmitri
I
meant
to
*NL*
kill
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
what
thoughts
were
in
your
mind
then
,
''
said
Smerdyakov
*NL*
resentfully
;
``
and
so
I
stopped
you
then
at
the
gate
to
sound
you
on
that
*NL*
very
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
sound
what
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
very
circumstance
,
whether
you
wanted
your
father
to
be
*NL*
murdered
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
infuriated
Ivan
more
than
anything
was
the
aggressive
,
insolent
tone
*NL*
to
which
Smerdyakov
persistently
adhered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
murdered
him
?
''
he
cried
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
smiled
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
of
yourself
,
for
a
fact
,
that
it
was
n't
I
murdered
him
.
And
I
*NL*
should
have
thought
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
sensible
man
to
speak
of
*NL*
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
why
had
you
such
a
suspicion
about
me
at
the
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
know
already
,
it
was
simply
from
fear
.
For
I
was
in
such
a
*NL*
position
,
shaking
with
fear
,
that
I
suspected
every
one
.
I
resolved
to
*NL*
sound
you
,
too
,
for
I
thought
if
you
wanted
the
same
as
your
brother
,
then
*NL*
the
business
was
as
good
as
settled
and
I
should
be
crushed
like
a
fly
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
you
did
n't
say
that
a
fortnight
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
the
same
when
I
talked
to
you
in
the
hospital
,
only
I
thought
*NL*
you
'd
understand
without
wasting
words
,
and
that
being
such
a
sensible
man
*NL*
you
would
n't
care
to
talk
of
it
openly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
!
Come
answer
,
answer
,
I
insist
:
what
was
it
...
what
could
I
*NL*
have
done
to
put
such
a
degrading
suspicion
into
your
mean
soul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
the
murder
,
you
could
n't
have
done
that
and
did
n't
want
to
,
but
as
*NL*
for
wanting
some
one
else
to
do
it

that
was
just
what
you
did
want

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
coolly

how
coolly
he
speaks

But
why
should
I
have
wanted
it

*NL*
what
grounds
had
I
for
wanting
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
grounds
had
you
?
What
about
the
inheritance
?
''
said
Smerdyakov
*NL*
sarcastically
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
vindictively
.
``
Why
,
after
your
parent
's
*NL*
death
there
was
at
least
forty
thousand
to
come
to
each
of
you
,
and
very
*NL*
likely
more
,
but
if
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
got
married
then
to
that
lady
,
*NL*
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
,
she
would
have
had
all
his
capital
made
over
to
her
*NL*
directly
after
the
wedding
,
for
she
's
plenty
of
sense
,
so
that
your
parent
*NL*
would
not
have
left
you
two
roubles
between
the
three
of
you
.
And
were
*NL*
they
far
from
a
wedding
,
either
?
Not
a
hair
's
-
breadth
:
that
lady
had
only
*NL*
to
lift
her
little
finger
and
he
would
have
run
after
her
to
church
,
with
*NL*
his
tongue
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
restrained
himself
with
painful
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
he
commented
at
last
.
``
You

I
have

jumped
up

I
*NL*

you
down

killed
you

Speak
on

So
,
according
to
*NL*
you
,
I
had
fixed
on
Dmitri
to
do
it
;
I
was
reckoning
on
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
help

If

killed

then
he
would
lose

all
the
rights
of
a
nobleman
,
his
rank
and
property
,
and
would
go
off
to

exile

so
his
share
of
the
inheritance
would
come
to
you
and
your
brother
*NL*
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
in
equal
parts
;
so
you

each
have
not
forty

*NL*
sixty
thousand

There

not

you
did
reckon
on
Dmitri

one

it
would
have
been

I

wickedness

well

said
Smerdyakov
,
with
a
sarcastic
grin

``
So
that
it
was
just
by

more

you
showed

It

going

``
No

Ivan

grinding
his

acted
on

Ivan
sat
scowling

both
his

convulsively
pressed

``
Yes

n't
think
of
it

Though
blows
are
*NL*
forbidden
,
I
should
have
pounded
your
ugly
face
to
a
jelly

''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
looked
at
him
almost
with
relish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
ordinary
occasions
of
life
,
''
he
said
in
the
same
complacent
and
*NL*
sententious
tone
in
which
he
had
taunted
Grigory
and
argued
with
him
about
*NL*
religion
at
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
table
,
``
in
the
ordinary
occasions
of
life
,
*NL*
blows
on
the
face
are
forbidden
nowadays
by
law
,
and
people
have
given
*NL*
them
up
,
but
in
exceptional
occasions
of
life
people
still
fly
to
blows
,
*NL*
not
only
among
us
but
all
over
the
world

be
it
even
the
fullest
Republic
*NL*
of
France
,
just
as
in
the
time
of
Adam

never
will
leave

off

you

did
not
dare

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
learning
French
words
for
?
''
Ivan
nodded
towards
the
*NL*
exercise-book
lying
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
learn
them
so
as
to
improve
my
education
,
supposing
that
*NL*
I
may
myself
chance
to
go
some
day
to
those
happy
parts
of
Europe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
monster
.
''
Ivan
's
eyes
flashed
and
he
trembled
all
over
.
``
I
am
not
*NL*
afraid
of
your
accusations

you
can
say
what
you
like
about
me

if
I
*NL*
do
n't
beat
you
to
death

it
's
simply
because
I
suspect
you
of

crime

I
'll
drag
you
to
justice

I
'll
unmask
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
thinking
,
you
'd
better
keep
quiet

for
what
can
you

my
absolute
innocence

who
would
believe

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

snarled
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hit
the
mark

indeed

And
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
got
up
,
shaking
all
over
with
indignation
,
put
on
his
coat
,
and
*NL*
without
replying
further
to
Smerdyakov
,
without
even
looking
at
him
,
*NL*
walked
quickly
out
of
the
cottage
.
The
cool
evening
air
refreshed
him
.
*NL*
There
was
a
bright
moon
in
the
sky
.
A
nightmare
of
ideas
and
sensations
*NL*
filled
his
soul
.
``
Shall
I
go
at
once
and
give
information
against
*NL*
Smerdyakov
?
But
what
information
can
I
give
?
He
is
not
guilty
,
anyway
.
On
*NL*
the
contrary
,
he
'll
accuse
me
.
And
in
fact
,
why
did
I
set
off
for
*NL*
Tchermashnya
then
?
What
for
?
What
for
?
''
Ivan
asked
himself
.
``
Yes
,
of
*NL*
course
,
I
was
expecting
something
and
he
is
right
...
''
And
he
remembered
*NL*
for
the
hundredth
time
how
,
on
the
last
night
in
his
father
's
house
,
he
*NL*
had
listened
on
the
stairs
.
But
he
remembered
it
now
with
such
anguish
*NL*
that
he
stood
still
on
the
spot
as
though
he
had
been
stabbed
.
``
Yes
,
I
*NL*
expected
it
then
,
that
's
true
!
I
wanted
the
murder
,
I
did
want
the
murder
!
*NL*
Did
I
want
the
murder
?
Did
I
want
it
?
I
must
kill
Smerdyakov
!
If
I
do
n't
*NL*
dare
kill
Smerdyakov
now
,
life
is
not
worth
living
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
did
not
go
home
,
but
went
straight
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
alarmed
*NL*
her
by
his
appearance
.
He
was
like
a
madman
.
He
repeated
all
his
*NL*
conversation
with
Smerdyakov
,
every
syllable
of
it
.
He
could
n't
be
calmed
,
*NL*
however
much
she
tried
to
soothe
him
:
he
kept
walking
about
the
room
,
*NL*
speaking
strangely
,
disconnectedly
.
At
last
he
sat
down
,
put
his
elbows
on
*NL*
the
table
,
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
pronounced
this
strange
*NL*
sentence
:
``
If
it
's
not
Dmitri
,
but
Smerdyakov
who
's
the
murderer
,
I
share
*NL*
his
guilt
,
for
I
put
him
up
to
it
.
Whether
I
did
,
I
do
n't
know
yet
.
But
if
*NL*
he
is
the
murderer
,
and
not
Dmitri
,
then
,
of
course
,
I
am
the
murderer
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Katerina
Ivanovna
heard
that
,
she
got
up
from
her
seat
without
a
*NL*
word
,
went
to
her
writing-table
,
opened
a
box
standing
on
it
,
took
out
a
*NL*
sheet
of
paper
and
laid
it
before
Ivan
.
This
was
the
document
of
which
*NL*
Ivan
spoke
to
Alyosha
later
on
as
a
``
conclusive
proof
''
that
Dmitri
had
*NL*
killed
his
father
.
It
was
the
letter
written
by
Mitya
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
when
he
was
drunk
,
on
the
very
evening
he
met
Alyosha
at
the
crossroads
on
*NL*
the
way
to
the
monastery
,
after
the
scene
at
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
,
when
*NL*
Grushenka
had
insulted
her
.
Then
,
parting
from
Alyosha
,
Mitya
had
rushed
*NL*
to
Grushenka
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
saw
her
,
but
in
the
evening
he
was
*NL*
at
the
``
Metropolis
,
''
where
he
got
thoroughly
drunk
.
Then
he
asked
for
pen
*NL*
and
paper
and
wrote
a
document
of
weighty
consequences
to
himself
.
It
was
*NL*
a
wordy
,
disconnected
,
frantic
letter
,
a
drunken
letter
in
fact
.
It
was
*NL*
like
the
talk
of
a
drunken
man
,
who
,
on
his
return
home
,
begins
with
*NL*
extraordinary
heat
telling
his
wife
or
one
of
his
household
how
he
has
*NL*
just
been
insulted
,
what
a
rascal
had
just
insulted
him
,
what
a
fine
*NL*
fellow
he
is
on
the
other
hand
,
and
how
he
will
pay
that
scoundrel
out
;
*NL*
and
all
that
at
great
length
,
with
great
excitement
and
incoherence
,
with
*NL*
drunken
tears
and
blows
on
the
table
.
The
letter
was
written
on
a
dirty
*NL*
piece
of
ordinary
paper
of
the
cheapest
kind
.
It
had
been
provided
by
the
*NL*
tavern
and
there
were
figures
scrawled
on
the
back
of
it
.
There
was
*NL*
evidently
not
space
enough
for
his
drunken
verbosity
and
Mitya
not
only
*NL*
filled
the
margins
but
had
written
the
last
line
right
across
the
rest
.
*NL*
The
letter
ran
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
FATAL
KATYA
:
To-morrow
I
will
get
the
money
and
repay
your
three
*NL*
thousand
and
farewell
,
woman
of
great
wrath
,
but
farewell
,
too
,
my
*NL*
love
!
Let
us
make
an
end
!
To-morrow
I
shall
try
and
get
it
from
*NL*
every
one
,
and
if
I
ca
n't
borrow
it
,
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
I
*NL*
shall
go
to
my
father
and
break
his
skull
and
take
the
money
from
*NL*
under
the
pillow
,
if
only
Ivan
has
gone
.
If
I
have
to
go
to
*NL*
Siberia
for
it
,
I
'll
give
you
back
your
three
thousand
.
And
*NL*
farewell
.
I
bow
down
to
the
ground
before
you
,
for
I
've
been
a
*NL*
scoundrel
to
you
.
Forgive
me
!
No
,
better
not
forgive
me
,
you
'll
be
*NL*
happier
and
so
shall
I
!
Better
Siberia
than
your
love
,
for
I
love
*NL*
another
woman
and
you
got
to
know
her
too
well
to-day
,
so
how
can
*NL*
you
forgive
?
I
will
murder
the
man
who
's
robbed
me
!
I
'll
leave
you
*NL*
all
and
go
to
the
East
so
as
to
see
no
one
again
.
Not
_
her
_
*NL*
either
,
for
you
are
not
my
only
tormentress
;
she
is
too
.
Farewell
!
*NL*
*NL*
P.S.
--
I
write
my
curse
,
but
I
adore
you
!
I
hear
it
in
my
heart
.
One
*NL*
string
is
left
,
and
it
vibrates
.
Better
tear
my
heart
in
two
!
I
*NL*
shall
kill
myself
,
but
first
of
all
that
cur
.
I
shall
tear
three
*NL*
thousand
from
him
and
fling
it
to
you
.
Though
I
've
been
a
*NL*
scoundrel
to
you
,
I
am
not
a
thief
!
You
can
expect
three
thousand

*NL*
The
cur
keeps
it
under
his
mattress
,
in
pink
ribbon

I
am
not
a
*NL*
thief
,
but
I
'll
murder
my
thief
.
Katya
,
do
n't
look
disdainful
.
*NL*
Dmitri
is
not
a
thief
!
but
a
murderer
!
He
has
murdered
his
father
*NL*
and
ruined
himself
to
hold
his
ground
,
rather
than
endure
your
*NL*
pride
.
And
he
does
n't
love
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.P.S.
--
I
kiss
your
feet
,
farewell
!
P.P.P.S.
--
Katya
,
pray
to
God
*NL*
that
some
one
'll
give
me
the
money
.
Then
I
shall
not
be
steeped
in
*NL*
gore
,
and
if
no
one
does
--
I
shall
!
Kill
me

When
Ivan
read
this
``
document
''
he
was
convinced
.
So
then
it
was
his
*NL*
brother
,
not
Smerdyakov
.
And
if
not
Smerdyakov
,
then
not
he
,
Ivan
.
This
*NL*
letter
at
once
assumed
in
his
eyes
the
aspect
of
a
logical
proof
.
There
*NL*
could
be
no
longer
the
slightest
doubt
of
Mitya
's
guilt
.
The
suspicion
*NL*
never
occurred
to
Ivan
,
by
the
way
,
that
Mitya
might
have
committed
the
*NL*
murder
in
conjunction
with
Smerdyakov
,
and
,
indeed
,
such
a
theory
did
not
*NL*
fit
in
with
the
facts
.
Ivan
was
completely
reassured
.
The
next
morning
he
*NL*
only
thought
of
Smerdyakov
and
his
gibes
with
contempt
.
A
few
days
later
*NL*
he
positively
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
so
horribly
distressed
at
*NL*
his
suspicions
.
He
resolved
to
dismiss
him
with
contempt
and
forget
him
.
*NL*
So
passed
a
month
.
He
made
no
further
inquiry
about
Smerdyakov
,
but
twice
*NL*
he
happened
to
hear
that
he
was
very
ill
and
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
end
in
madness
,
''
the
young
doctor
Varvinsky
observed
about
him
,
and
*NL*
Ivan
remembered
this
.
During
the
last
week
of
that
month
Ivan
himself
*NL*
began
to
feel
very
ill
.
He
went
to
consult
the
Moscow
doctor
who
had
been
*NL*
sent
for
by
Katerina
Ivanovna
just
before
the
trial
.
And
just
at
that
time
*NL*
his
relations
with
Katerina
Ivanovna
became
acutely
strained
.
They
were
*NL*
like
two
enemies
in
love
with
one
another
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
``
returns
''
*NL*
to
Mitya
,
that
is
,
her
brief
but
violent
revulsions
of
feeling
in
his
*NL*
favor
,
drove
Ivan
to
perfect
frenzy
.
Strange
to
say
,
until
that
last
scene
*NL*
described
above
,
when
Alyosha
came
from
Mitya
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
Ivan
*NL*
had
never
once
,
during
that
month
,
heard
her
express
a
doubt
of
Mitya
's
*NL*
guilt
,
in
spite
of
those
``
returns
''
that
were
so
hateful
to
him
.
It
is
*NL*
remarkable
,
too
,
that
while
he
felt
that
he
hated
Mitya
more
and
more
*NL*
every
day
,
he
realized
that
it
was
not
on
account
of
Katya
's
``
returns
''
*NL*
that
he
hated
him
,
but
just
_
because
he
was
the
murderer
of
his
father
_
.
*NL*
He
was
conscious
of
this
and
fully
recognized
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
went
to
see
Mitya
ten
days
before
the
trial
and
proposed
*NL*
to
him
a
plan
of
escape
--
a
plan
he
had
obviously
thought
over
a
long
time
.
*NL*
He
was
partly
impelled
to
do
this
by
a
sore
place
still
left
in
his
heart
*NL*
from
a
phrase
of
Smerdyakov
's
,
that
it
was
to
his
,
Ivan
's
,
advantage
that
*NL*
his
brother
should
be
convicted
,
as
that
would
increase
his
inheritance
*NL*
and
Alyosha
's
from
forty
to
sixty
thousand
roubles
.
He
determined
to
*NL*
sacrifice
thirty
thousand
on
arranging
Mitya
's
escape
.
On
his
return
from
*NL*
seeing
him
,
he
was
very
mournful
and
dispirited
;
he
suddenly
began
to
feel
*NL*
that
he
was
anxious
for
Mitya
's
escape
,
not
only
to
heal
that
sore
place
*NL*
by
sacrificing
thirty
thousand
,
but
for
another
reason
.
``
Is
it
because
I
*NL*
am
as
much
a
murderer
at
heart
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
Something
very
deep
*NL*
down
seemed
burning
and
rankling
in
his
soul
.
His
pride
above
all
suffered
*NL*
cruelly
all
that
month
.
But
of
that
later
...
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
after
his
conversation
with
Alyosha
,
Ivan
suddenly
decided
with
his
*NL*
hand
on
the
bell
of
his
lodging
to
go
to
Smerdyakov
,
he
obeyed
a
sudden
*NL*
and
peculiar
impulse
of
indignation
.
He
suddenly
remembered
how
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
had
only
just
cried
out
to
him
in
Alyosha
's
presence
:
``
It
was
*NL*
you
,
you
,
persuaded
me
of
his
''
-LRB-
that
is
,
Mitya
's
-RRB-
``
guilt
!
''
Ivan
was
*NL*
thunderstruck
when
he
recalled
it
.
He
had
never
once
tried
to
persuade
her
*NL*
that
Mitya
was
the
murderer
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
had
suspected
himself
in
*NL*
her
presence
,
that
time
when
he
came
back
from
Smerdyakov
.
It
was
_
she
_
,
*NL*
she
,
who
had
produced
that
``
document
''
and
proved
his
brother
's
guilt
.
And
*NL*
now
she
suddenly
exclaimed
:
``
I
've
been
at
Smerdyakov
's
myself
!
''
When
had
*NL*
she
been
there
?
Ivan
had
known
nothing
of
it
.
So
she
was
not
at
all
so
*NL*
sure
of
Mitya
's
guilt
!
And
what
could
Smerdyakov
have
told
her
?
What
,
*NL*
what
,
had
he
said
to
her
?
His
heart
burned
with
violent
anger
.
He
could
*NL*
not
understand
how
he
could
,
half
an
hour
before
,
have
let
those
words
*NL*
pass
and
not
have
cried
out
at
the
moment
.
He
let
go
of
the
bell
and
*NL*
rushed
off
to
Smerdyakov
.
``
I
shall
kill
him
,
perhaps
,
this
time
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
on
the
way
.

Chapter

The
Third
And
Last
Interview
With
Smerdyakov
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
half-way
there
,
the
keen
dry
wind
that
had
been
blowing
early
*NL*
that
morning
rose
again
,
and
a
fine
dry
snow
began
falling
thickly
.
It
did
*NL*
not
lie
on
the
ground
,
but
was
whirled
about
by
the
wind
,
and
soon
there
*NL*
was
a
regular
snowstorm
.
There
were
scarcely
any
lamp-posts
in
the
part
of
*NL*
the
town
where
Smerdyakov
lived
.
Ivan
strode
alone
in
the
darkness
,
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
storm
,
instinctively
picking
out
his
way
.
His
head
*NL*
ached
and
there
was
a
painful
throbbing
in
his
temples
.
He
felt
that
his
*NL*
hands
were
twitching
convulsively
.
Not
far
from
Marya
Kondratyevna
's
*NL*
cottage
,
Ivan
suddenly
came
upon
a
solitary
drunken
little
peasant
.
He
was
*NL*
wearing
a
coarse
and
patched
coat
,
and
was
walking
in
zigzags
,
grumbling
*NL*
and
swearing
to
himself
.
Then
suddenly
he
would
begin
singing
in
a
husky
*NL*
drunken
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
Vanka
's
gone
to
Petersburg
;
*NL*
I
wo
n't
wait
till
he
comes
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
broke
off
every
time
at
the
second
line
and
began
swearing
again
;
*NL*
then
he
would
begin
the
same
song
again
.
Ivan
felt
an
intense
hatred
for
*NL*
him
before
he
had
thought
about
him
at
all
.
Suddenly
he
realized
his
*NL*
presence
and
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
knock
him
down
.
At
that
*NL*
moment
they
met
,
and
the
peasant
with
a
violent
lurch
fell
full
tilt
*NL*
against
Ivan
,
who
pushed
him
back
furiously
.
The
peasant
went
flying
*NL*
backwards
and
fell
like
a
log
on
the
frozen
ground
.
He
uttered
one
*NL*
plaintive
``
O
--
oh
!
''
and
then
was
silent
.
Ivan
stepped
up
to
him
.
He
was
*NL*
lying
on
his
back
,
without
movement
or
consciousness
.
``
He
will
be
frozen
,
''
*NL*
thought
Ivan
,
and
he
went
on
his
way
to
Smerdyakov
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
passage
,
Marya
Kondratyevna
,
who
ran
out
to
open
the
door
with
a
*NL*
candle
in
her
hand
,
whispered
that
Smerdyakov
was
very
ill
,
``
It
's
not
that
*NL*
he
's
laid
up
,
but
he
seems
not
himself
,
and
he
even
told
us
to
take
the
*NL*
tea
away
;
he
would
n't
have
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
does
he
make
a
row
?
''
asked
Ivan
coarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
no
,
quite
the
contrary
,
he
's
very
quiet
.
Only
please
do
n't
talk
*NL*
to
him
too
long
,
''
Marya
Kondratyevna
begged
him
.
Ivan
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
stepped
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
over-heated
as
before
,
but
there
were
changes
in
the
room
.
One
of
*NL*
the
benches
at
the
side
had
been
removed
,
and
in
its
place
had
been
put
a
*NL*
large
old
mahogany
leather
sofa
,
on
which
a
bed
had
been
made
up
,
with
*NL*
fairly
clean
white
pillows
.
Smerdyakov
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
,
wearing
*NL*
the
same
dressing-gown
.
The
table
had
been
brought
out
in
front
of
the
*NL*
sofa
,
so
that
there
was
hardly
room
to
move
.
On
the
table
lay
a
thick
book
*NL*
in
yellow
cover
,
but
Smerdyakov
was
not
reading
it
.
He
seemed
to
be
*NL*
sitting
doing
nothing
.
He
met
Ivan
with
a
slow
silent
gaze
,
and
was
*NL*
apparently
not
at
all
surprised
at
his
coming
.
There
was
a
great
change
in
*NL*
his
face
;
he
was
much
thinner
and
sallower
.
His
eyes
were
sunken
and
there
*NL*
were
blue
marks
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
really
are
ill
?
''
Ivan
stopped
short
.
``
I
wo
n't
keep
you
long
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
even
take
off
my
coat
.
Where
can
one
sit
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
moved
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
on
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
look
at
me
without
speaking
?
I
've
only
come
with
one
question
,
*NL*
and
I
swear
I
wo
n't
go
without
an
answer
.
Has
the
young
lady
,
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
been
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
still
remained
silent
,
looking
quietly
at
Ivan
as
before
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
,
he
turned
his
face
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
cried
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
`
nothing
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
has
.
It
's
no
matter
to
you
.
Let
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
let
you
alone
.
Tell
me
,
when
was
she
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
'd
quite
forgotten
about
her
,
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
with
a
scornful
*NL*
smile
,
and
turning
his
face
to
Ivan
again
,
he
stared
at
him
with
a
look
of
*NL*
frenzied
hatred
,
the
same
look
that
he
had
fixed
on
him
at
their
last
*NL*
interview
,
a
month
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
very
ill
yourself
,
your
face
is
sunken
;
you
do
n't
look
like
*NL*
yourself
,
''
he
said
to
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
my
health
,
tell
me
what
I
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
your
eyes
so
yellow
?
The
whites
are
quite
yellow
.
Are
you
so
*NL*
worried
?
''
He
smiled
contemptuously
and
suddenly
laughed
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
;
I
've
told
you
I
wo
n't
go
away
without
an
answer
!
''
Ivan
cried
,
*NL*
intensely
irritated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
keep
pestering
me
?
Why
do
you
torment
me
?
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
*NL*
with
a
look
of
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
!
I
've
nothing
to
do
with
you
.
Just
answer
my
question
and
I
'll
go
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
answer
to
give
you
,
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
looking
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
sure
I
'll
make
you
answer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
so
uneasy
?
''
Smerdyakov
stared
at
him
,
not
simply
with
*NL*
contempt
,
but
almost
with
repulsion
.
``
Is
this
because
the
trial
begins
to
-
*NL*
morrow
?
Nothing
will
happen
to
you
;
ca
n't
you
believe
that
at
last
?
Go
*NL*
home
,
go
to
bed
and
sleep
in
peace
,
do
n't
be
afraid
of
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
...
What
have
I
to
be
afraid
of
to-morrow
?
''
Ivan
*NL*
articulated
in
astonishment
,
and
suddenly
a
chill
breath
of
fear
did
in
*NL*
fact
pass
over
his
soul
.
Smerdyakov
measured
him
with
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
?
''
he
drawled
reproachfully
.
``
It
's
a
strange
thing
a
*NL*
sensible
man
should
care
to
play
such
a
farce
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
looked
at
him
speechless
.
The
startling
,
incredibly
supercilious
tone
*NL*
of
this
man
who
had
once
been
his
valet
,
was
extraordinary
in
itself
.
He
*NL*
had
not
taken
such
a
tone
even
at
their
last
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
you
've
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
.
I
wo
n't
say
anything
about
*NL*
you
;
there
's
no
proof
against
you
.
I
say
,
how
your
hands
are
trembling
!
*NL*
Why
are
your
fingers
moving
like
that
?
Go
home
,
_
you
_
did
not
murder
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
started
.
He
remembered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
was
not
I
,
''
he
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
Smerdyakov
caught
him
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
jumped
up
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
everything
,
you
viper
!
Tell
me
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
not
in
the
least
scared
.
He
only
riveted
his
eyes
on
Ivan
*NL*
with
insane
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
you
who
murdered
him
,
if
that
's
it
,
''
he
whispered
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
sank
back
on
his
chair
,
as
though
pondering
something
.
He
laughed
*NL*
malignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
my
going
away
.
What
you
talked
about
last
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stood
before
me
last
time
and
understood
it
all
,
and
you
understand
*NL*
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
understand
is
that
you
are
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
tired
of
it
?
Here
we
are
face
to
face
;
what
's
the
use
of
going
*NL*
on
keeping
up
a
farce
to
each
other
?
Are
you
still
trying
to
throw
it
all
*NL*
on
me
,
to
my
face
?
_
You
_
murdered
him
;
you
are
the
real
murderer
,
I
was
*NL*
only
your
instrument
,
your
faithful
servant
,
and
it
was
following
your
*NL*
words
I
did
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Did
_
it
?
Why
,
did
you
murder
him
?
''
Ivan
turned
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
seemed
to
give
way
in
his
brain
,
and
he
shuddered
all
over
with
*NL*
a
cold
shiver
.
Then
Smerdyakov
himself
looked
at
him
wonderingly
;
probably
*NL*
the
genuineness
of
Ivan
's
horror
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
really
did
not
know
?
''
he
faltered
*NL*
mistrustfully
,
looking
with
a
forced
smile
into
his
eyes
.
Ivan
still
gazed
*NL*
at
him
,
and
seemed
unable
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ach
,
Vanka
's
gone
to
Petersburg
;
*NL*
I
wo
n't
wait
till
he
comes
back
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
suddenly
echoed
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
am
afraid
that
you
are
a
dream
,
a
phantom
sitting
before
*NL*
me
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
phantom
here
,
but
only
us
two
and
one
other
.
No
doubt
he
is
*NL*
here
,
that
third
,
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
Who
is
here
?
What
third
person
?
''
Ivan
cried
in
alarm
,
looking
*NL*
about
him
,
his
eyes
hastily
searching
in
every
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
third
is
God
Himself
--
Providence
.
He
is
the
third
beside
us
now
.
Only
*NL*
do
n't
look
for
Him
,
you
wo
n't
find
Him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
that
you
killed
him
!
''
Ivan
cried
madly
.
``
You
are
mad
,
or
*NL*
teasing
me
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
as
before
,
watched
him
curiously
,
with
no
sign
of
fear
.
He
*NL*
could
still
scarcely
get
over
his
incredulity
;
he
still
fancied
that
Ivan
*NL*
knew
everything
and
was
trying
to
``
throw
it
all
on
him
to
his
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
he
said
at
last
in
a
weak
voice
,
and
suddenly
bringing
up
*NL*
his
left
leg
from
under
the
table
,
he
began
turning
up
his
trouser
leg
.
He
*NL*
was
wearing
long
white
stockings
and
slippers
.
Slowly
he
took
off
his
*NL*
garter
and
fumbled
to
the
bottom
of
his
stocking
.
Ivan
gazed
at
him
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
shuddered
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
mad
!
''
he
cried
,
and
rapidly
jumping
up
,
he
drew
back
,
so
that
he
*NL*
knocked
his
back
against
the
wall
and
stood
up
against
it
,
stiff
and
*NL*
straight
.
He
looked
with
insane
terror
at
Smerdyakov
,
who
,
entirely
*NL*
unaffected
by
his
terror
,
continued
fumbling
in
his
stocking
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
making
an
effort
to
get
hold
of
something
with
his
fingers
and
pull
*NL*
it
out
.
At
last
he
got
hold
of
it
and
began
pulling
it
out
.
Ivan
saw
that
*NL*
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
,
or
perhaps
a
roll
of
papers
.
Smerdyakov
pulled
it
*NL*
out
and
laid
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Ivan
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
look
at
it
,
''
Smerdyakov
answered
,
still
in
the
same
low
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
stepped
up
to
the
table
,
took
up
the
roll
of
paper
and
began
*NL*
unfolding
it
,
but
suddenly
he
drew
back
his
fingers
,
as
though
from
*NL*
contact
with
a
loathsome
reptile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hands
keep
twitching
,
''
observed
Smerdyakov
,
and
he
deliberately
*NL*
unfolded
the
bundle
himself
.
Under
the
wrapper
were
three
packets
of
*NL*
hundred-rouble
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
all
here
,
all
the
three
thousand
roubles
;
you
need
not
count
*NL*
them
.
Take
them
,
''
Smerdyakov
suggested
to
Ivan
,
nodding
at
the
notes
.
Ivan
*NL*
sank
back
in
his
chair
.
He
was
as
white
as
a
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
frightened
me
...
with
your
stocking
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
strange
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
really
not
have
known
till
now
?
''
Smerdyakov
asked
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
not
know
.
I
kept
thinking
of
Dmitri
.
Brother
,
brother
!
Ach
!
''
He
*NL*
suddenly
clutched
his
head
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Did

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
only

Smerdyakov
muttered
in
surprise

some
lemonade

I
'll
ask

Only
I

*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
motioned
at
the
notes
.
He
was
just
going
to
get
up
and
call
*NL*
at
the
door
to
Marya
Kondratyevna
to
make
some
lemonade
and
bring
it
them
,
*NL*
but
,
looking
for
something
to
cover
up
the
notes
that
she
might
not
see
*NL*
them
,
he
first
took
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
as
it
turned
out
to
be
very
*NL*
dirty
,
took
up
the
big
yellow
book
that
Ivan
had
noticed
at
first
lying
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
put
it
over
the
notes
.
The
book
was
_
The
Sayings
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Father
Isaac
the
Syrian
_
.
Ivan
read
it
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
have
any
lemonade

he
said
.
``
Talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd

take

you
'll
be

hot

Ivan
,
as
*NL*
though
he
'd
only
just
thought
of
it
,
took
off
his
coat
,
and
,
without
*NL*
getting
up
from
his
chair
,
threw
it
on
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

please

speak

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
calmer
.
He
waited
,
feeling
sure
that
Smerdyakov
would
tell
him
*NL*
_
all
_
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
it
was
done
?
''
sighed
Smerdyakov
.
``
It
was
done
in
a
most
natural
way

*NL*
following
your
very
words

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
my

''
Ivan
broke
in
again
,
apparently
with
complete
self
-
*NL*
possession
,
firmly
uttering
his
words
,
and
not
shouting
as
before
.
``
Only
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

I

In

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

naturally

I
shammed
it
all

I
went
quietly
down
the
steps
to
*NL*
the
very
bottom
and
lay
down
quietly
,
and
as
I
lay
down
I
gave
a

carried

out

in

I
had
a
real
attack
and
a
more
violent
one
than
I

For

They
laid

At

*NL*
``
All

I
expected

I
thought
that
was
certain

I
had
prepared
him
for
it
...
during
the
last
few
days
...
He
knew
about
*NL*
the
knocks
,
that
was
the
chief
thing
.
With
his
suspiciousness
and
the
fury
*NL*
which
had
been
growing
in
him
all
those
days
,
he
was
bound
to
get
into
the
*NL*
house
by
means
of
those
taps
.
That
was
inevitable
,
so
I
was
expecting
*NL*
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
''
Ivan
interrupted
;
``
if
he
had
killed
him
,
he
would
have
taken
the
*NL*
money
and
carried
it
away
;
you
must
have
considered
that
.
What
would
you
*NL*
have
got
by
it
afterwards
?
I
do
n't
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
would
never
have
found
the
money
.
That
was
only
what
I
told
him
,
*NL*
that
the
money
was
under
the
mattress
.
But
that
was
n't
true
.
It
had
been
*NL*
lying
in
a
box
.
And
afterwards
I
suggested
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
as
I
was
*NL*
the
only
person
he
trusted
,
to
hide
the
envelope
with
the
notes
in
the
*NL*
corner
behind
the
ikons
,
for
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
place
,
*NL*
especially
if
they
came
in
a
hurry
.
So
that
's
where
the
envelope
lay
,
in
*NL*
the
corner
behind
the
ikons
.
It
would
have
been
absurd
to
keep
it
under
*NL*
the
mattress
;
the
box
,
anyway
,
could
be
locked
.
But
all
believe
it
was
*NL*
under
the
mattress
.
A
stupid
thing
to
believe
.
So
if
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
*NL*
had
committed
the
murder
,
finding
nothing
,
he
would
either
have
run
away
*NL*
in
a
hurry
,
afraid
of
every
sound
,
as
always
happens
with
murderers
,
or
he
*NL*
would
have
been
arrested
.
So
I
could
always
have
clambered
up
to
the
ikons
*NL*
and
have
taken
away
the
money
next
morning
or
even
that
night
,
and
it
*NL*
would
have
all
been
put
down
to
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
I
could
reckon
upon
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
if
he
did
not
kill
him

only

him
down

*NL*
*NL*

he

I
would

and
nothing
would
have
happened
.
But
I
calculated
that
he
would
*NL*
beat
him
senseless
,
and
I
should
have
time
to
take
it
then
,
and
then
I
'd
*NL*
make
out
to
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
that
it
was
no
one

Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
*NL*

had
taken
the
money
after
beating
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

the
murderer

I
do
n't

to
lie
to
you

n't

I
see
for

not

so

to
throw
your
guilt

to
my
very
face

are
still
responsible
for
it
all

you
knew
of
the
murder

charged

do
it

went
away

so
I
want
to
*NL*
prove
to
your
face
this
evening
that
you
are
the
only
real
murderer

the
*NL*
whole
affair

I
am
not
the
real

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

a
murderer

Ivan
cried
,
unable
to
restrain
*NL*
himself
at
last
,
and
forgetting
that
he
had
put
off
discussing
himself
*NL*
till
the
end
of
the
conversation

``

you
really
took
Tchermashnya

consent

you

Assured

contrary

Ivan

And
what

against

What

you

nonsense

Besides

after
our
conversation
you

nothing

should
have

attempted
nothing

As
you
went
away

it
meant
you
assured
me
that
you
*NL*
would
n't
dare
to
inform
against
me
at
the
trial
,
and
that
you
'd
overlook
*NL*
my
having
the
three
thousand

And
,
indeed
,
you
could
n't
have
prosecuted
me
*NL*
afterwards

because
then
I
should
have
told
it
all
in

court

have
said

that
you
'd
put
me
up
to
the
theft
and
the
murder
,
though
I
did
n't
*NL*
consent
to
it

That
's
why
I
needed
your
consent

so
that
you
could

have

cornered
me
afterwards

for
what
proof

I
could
always

cornered

revealing
your
eagerness

death

I
*NL*
tell

you

ashamed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was

Ivan
snarled
again

*NL*

To

by

silently
sanctioned

''
Smerdyakov
looked
resolutely
at
Ivan
.
He
was
very
weak
and
spoke
*NL*
slowly
and
wearily
,
but
some
hidden
inner
force
urged
him
on
.
He
evidently
*NL*
had
some
design
.
Ivan
felt
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
he
said
.
``
Tell
me
what
happened
that
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
more
is
there
to
tell
!
I
lay
there
and
I
thought
I
heard
the
master
*NL*
shout
.
And
before
that
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
had
suddenly
got
up
and
came
*NL*
out
,
and
he
suddenly
gave
a
scream
,
and
then
all
was
silence
and
darkness
.
*NL*
I
lay
there
waiting
,
my
heart
beating
;
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
I
got
up
at
*NL*
last
,
went
out
.
I
saw
the
window
open
on
the
left
into
the
garden
,
and
I
*NL*
stepped
to
the
left
to
listen
whether
he
was
sitting
there
alive
,
and
I
*NL*
heard
the
master
moving
about
,
sighing
,
so
I
knew
he
was
alive
.
`
Ech
!
'
I
*NL*
thought
.
I
went
to
the
window
and
shouted
to
the
master
,
`
It
's
I.
'
And
he
*NL*
shouted
to
me
,
`
He
's
been
,
he
's
been
;
he
's
run
away
.
'
He
meant
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
had
been
.
`
He
's
killed
Grigory
!
'
`
Where
?
'
I
whispered
.
*NL*
`
There
,
in
the
corner
,
'
he
pointed
.
He
was
whispering
,
too
.
`
Wait
a
bit
,
'
*NL*
I
said
.
I
went
to
the
corner
of
the
garden
to
look
,
and
there
I
came
upon
*NL*
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
lying
by
the
wall
,
covered
with
blood
,
senseless
.
So
*NL*
it
's
true
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
has
been
here
,
was
the
thought
that
*NL*
came
into
my
head
,
and
I
determined
on
the
spot
to
make
an
end
of
it
,
as
*NL*
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
,
even
if
he
were
alive
,
would
see
nothing
of
it
,
as
*NL*
he
lay
there
senseless
.
The
only
risk
was
that
Marfa
Ignatyevna
might
wake
*NL*
up
.
I
felt
that
at
the
moment
,
but
the
longing
to
get
it
done
came
over
*NL*
me
,
till
I
could
scarcely
breathe
.
I
went
back
to
the
window
to
the
master
*NL*
and
said
,
`
She
's
here
,
she
's
come
;
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
has
come
,
wants
*NL*
to
be
let
in
.
'
And
he
started
like
a
baby
.
`
Where
is
she
?
'
he
fairly
*NL*
gasped
,
but
could
n't
believe
it
.
`
She
's
standing
there
,
'
said
I.
`
Open
.
'
*NL*
He
looked
out
of
the
window
at
me
,
half
believing
and
half
distrustful
,
*NL*
but
afraid
to
open
.
`
Why
,
he
is
afraid
of
me
now
,
'
I
thought
.
And
it
was
*NL*
funny
.
I
bethought
me
to
knock
on
the
window-frame
those
taps
we
'd
agreed
*NL*
upon
as
a
signal
that
Grushenka
had
come
,
in
his
presence
,
before
his
*NL*
eyes
.
He
did
n't
seem
to
believe
my
word
,
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
taps
,
*NL*
he
ran
at
once
to
open
the
door
.
He
opened
it
.
I
would
have
gone
in
,
but
*NL*
he
stood
in
the
way
to
prevent
me
passing
.
`
Where
is
she
?
Where
is
she
?
'
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
,
all
of
a
tremble
.
`
Well
,
'
thought
I
,
`
if
he
's
so
*NL*
frightened
of
me
as
all
that
,
it
's
a
bad
look
out
!
'
And
my
legs
went
weak
*NL*
with
fright
that
he
would
n't
let
me
in
or
would
call
out
,
or
Marfa
*NL*
Ignatyevna
would
run
up
,
or
something
else
might
happen
.
I
do
n't
remember
*NL*
now
,
but
I
must
have
stood
pale
,
facing
him
.
I
whispered
to
him
,
`
Why
,
*NL*
she
's
there
,
there
,
under
the
window
;
how
is
it
you
do
n't
see
her
?
'
I
*NL*
said
.
`
Bring
her
then
,
bring
her
.
'
`
She
's
afraid
,
'
said
I
;
`
she
was
*NL*
frightened
at
the
noise
,
she
's
hidden
in
the
bushes
;
go
and
call
to
her
*NL*
yourself
from
the
study
.
'
He
ran
to
the
window
,
put
the
candle
in
the
*NL*
window
.
`
Grushenka
,
'
he
cried
,
`
Grushenka
,
are
you
here
?
'
Though
he
cried
*NL*
that
,
he
did
n't
want
to
lean
out
of
the
window
,
he
did
n't
want
to
move
*NL*
away
from
me
,
for
he
was
panic-stricken
;
he
was
so
frightened
he
did
n't
*NL*
dare
to
turn
his
back
on
me
.
`
Why
,
here
she
is
,
'
said
I.
I
went
up
to
the
*NL*
window
and
leaned
right
out
of
it
.
`
Here
she
is
;
she
's
in
the
bush
,
*NL*
laughing
at
you
,
do
n't
you
see
her
?
'
He
suddenly
believed
it
;
he
was
all
*NL*
of
a
shake
--
he
was
awfully
crazy
about
her
--
and
he
leaned
right
out
of
the
*NL*
window
.
I
snatched
up
that
iron
paper-weight
from
his
table
;
do
you
*NL*
remember
,
weighing
about
three
pounds
?
I
swung
it
and
hit
him
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
skull
with
the
corner
of
it
.
He
did
n't
even
cry
out
.
He
only
sank
*NL*
down
suddenly
,
and
I
hit
him
again
and
a
third
time
.
And
the
third
time
I
*NL*
knew
I
'd
broken
his
skull
.
He
suddenly
rolled
on
his
back
,
face
upwards
,
*NL*
covered
with
blood
.
I
looked
round
.
There
was
no
blood
on
me
,
not
a
spot
.
*NL*
I
wiped
the
paper-weight
,
put
it
back
,
went
up
to
the
ikons
,
took
the
*NL*
money
out
of
the
envelope
,
and
flung
the
envelope
on
the
floor
and
the
*NL*
pink
ribbon
beside
it
.
I
went
out
into
the
garden
all
of
a
tremble
,
*NL*
straight
to
the
apple-tree
with
a
hollow
in
it
--
you
know
that
hollow
.
I
'd
*NL*
marked
it
long
before
and
put
a
rag
and
a
piece
of
paper
ready
in
it
.
I
*NL*
wrapped
all
the
notes
in
the
rag
and
stuffed
it
deep
down
in
the
hole
.
And
*NL*
there
it
stayed
for
over
a
fortnight
.
I
took
it
out
later
,
when
I
came
out
*NL*
of
the
hospital
.
I
went
back
to
my
bed
,
lay
down
and
thought
,
`
If
Grigory
*NL*
Vassilyevitch
has
been
killed
outright
it
may
be
a
bad
job
for
me
,
but
if
*NL*
he
is
not
killed
and
recovers
,
it
will
be
first-rate
,
for
then
he
'll
bear
*NL*
witness
that
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
has
been
here
,
and
so
he
must
have
killed
*NL*
him
and
taken
the
money
.
'
Then
I
began
groaning
with
suspense
and
*NL*
impatience
,
so
as
to
wake
Marfa
Ignatyevna
as
soon
as
possible
.
At
last
*NL*
she
got
up
and
she
rushed
to
me
,
but
when
she
saw
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
*NL*
was
not
there
,
she
ran
out
,
and
I
heard
her
scream
in
the
garden
.
And
that
*NL*
set
it
all
going
and
set
my
mind
at
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
.
Ivan
had
listened
all
the
time
in
dead
silence
without
*NL*
stirring
or
taking
his
eyes
off
him
.
As
he
told
his
story
Smerdyakov
*NL*
glanced
at
him
from
time
to
time
,
but
for
the
most
part
kept
his
eyes
*NL*
averted
.
When
he
had
finished
he
was
evidently
agitated
and
was
breathing
*NL*
hard
.
The
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
face
.
But
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
tell
whether
it
was
remorse
he
was
feeling
,
or
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
''
cried
Ivan
,
pondering
.
``
What
about
the
door
?
If
he
only
opened
the
*NL*
door
to
you
,
how
could
Grigory
have
seen
it
open
before
?
For
Grigory
saw
*NL*
it
before
you
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
remarkable
that
Ivan
spoke
quite
amicably
,
in
a
different
tone
,
not
*NL*
angry
as
before
,
so
if
any
one
had
opened
the
door
at
that
moment
and
*NL*
peeped
in
at
them
,
he
would
certainly
have
concluded
that
they
were
*NL*
talking
peaceably
about
some
ordinary
,
though
interesting
,
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
that
door
and
Grigory
Vassilyevitch
's
having
seen
it
open
,
that
's
*NL*
only
his
fancy
,
''
said
Smerdyakov
,
with
a
wry
smile
.
``
He
is
not
a
man
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
but
an
obstinate
mule
.
He
did
n't
see
it
,
but
fancied
he
had
*NL*
seen
it
,
and
there
's
no
shaking
him
.
It
's
just
our
luck
he
took
that
*NL*
notion
into
his
head
,
for
they
ca
n't
fail
to
convict
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
*NL*
after
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
...
''
said
Ivan
,
beginning
to
seem
bewildered
again
and
making
an
*NL*
effort
to
grasp
something
.
``
Listen
.
There
are
a
lot
of
questions
I
want
to
*NL*
ask
you
,
but
I
forget
them
...
I
keep
forgetting
and
getting
mixed
up
.
*NL*
Yes
.
Tell
me
this
at
least
,
why
did
you
open
the
envelope
and
leave
it
*NL*
there
on
the
floor
?
Why
did
n't
you
simply
carry
off
the
envelope
?
...
When
*NL*
you
were
telling
me
,
I
thought
you
spoke
about
it
as
though
it
were
the
*NL*
right
thing
to
do
...
but
why
,
I
ca
n't
understand
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
that
for
a
good
reason
.
For
if
a
man
had
known
all
about
it
,
as
I
*NL*
did
for
instance
,
if
he
'd
seen
those
notes
before
,
and
perhaps
had
put
*NL*
them
in
that
envelope
himself
,
and
had
seen
the
envelope
sealed
up
and
*NL*
addressed
,
with
his
own
eyes
,
if
such
a
man
had
done
the
murder
,
what
*NL*
should
have
made
him
tear
open
the
envelope
afterwards
,
especially
in
such
*NL*
desperate
haste
,
since
he
'd
know
for
certain
the
notes
must
be
in
the
*NL*
envelope
?
No
,
if
the
robber
had
been
some
one
like
me
,
he
'd
simply
have
*NL*
put
the
envelope
straight
in
his
pocket
and
got
away
with
it
as
fast
as
he
*NL*
could
.
But
it
'd
be
quite
different
with
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
He
only
knew
*NL*
about
the
envelope
by
hearsay
;
he
had
never
seen
it
,
and
if
he
'd
found
it
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
under
the
mattress
,
he
'd
have
torn
it
open
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
to
make
sure
the
notes
were
in
it
.
And
he
'd
have
thrown
the
*NL*
envelope
down
,
without
having
time
to
think
that
it
would
be
evidence
*NL*
against
him
.
Because
he
was
not
an
habitual
thief
and
had
never
directly
*NL*
stolen
anything
before
,
for
he
is
a
gentleman
born
,
and
if
he
did
bring
*NL*
himself
to
steal
,
it
would
not
be
regular
stealing
,
but
simply
taking
what
*NL*
was
his
own
,
for
he
'd
told
the
whole
town
he
meant
to
before
,
and
had
even
*NL*
bragged
aloud
before
every
one
that
he
'd
go
and
take
his
property
from
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
I
did
n't
say
that
openly
to
the
prosecutor
when
I
was
*NL*
being
examined
,
but
quite
the
contrary
,
I
brought
him
to
it
by
a
hint
,
as
*NL*
though
I
did
n't
see
it
myself
,
and
as
though
he
'd
thought
of
it
himself
*NL*
and
I
had
n't
prompted
him
;
so
that
Mr.
Prosecutor
's
mouth
positively
*NL*
watered
at
my
suggestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
you
possibly
have
thought
of
all
that
on
the
spot
?
''
cried
Ivan
,
*NL*
overcome
with
astonishment
.
He
looked
at
Smerdyakov
again
with
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
!
Could
any
one
think
of
it
all
in
such
a
desperate
hurry
?
It
*NL*
was
all
thought
out
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
...
well
,
it
was
the
devil
helped
you
!
''
Ivan
cried
again
.
``
No
,
you
*NL*
are
not
a
fool
,
you
are
far
cleverer
than
I
thought
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
,
obviously
intending
to
walk
across
the
room
.
He
was
in
terrible
*NL*
distress
.
But
as
the
table
blocked
his
way
,
and
there
was
hardly
room
to
*NL*
pass
between
the
table
and
the
wall
,
he
only
turned
round
where
he
stood
*NL*
and
sat
down
again
.
Perhaps
the
impossibility
of
moving
irritated
him
,
as
*NL*
he
suddenly
cried
out
almost
as
furiously
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
you
miserable
,
contemptible
creature
!
Do
n't
you
understand
that
*NL*
if
I
have
n't
killed
you
,
it
's
simply
because
I
am
keeping
you
to
answer
*NL*
to-morrow
at
the
trial
.
God
sees
,
''
Ivan
raised
his
hand
,
``
perhaps
I
,
too
,
*NL*
was
guilty
;
perhaps
I
really
had
a
secret
desire
for
my
father
's
...
*NL*
death
,
but
I
swear
I
was
not
as
guilty
as
you
think
,
and
perhaps
I
did
n't
*NL*
urge
you
on
at
all
.
No
,
no
,
I
did
n't
urge
you
on
!
But
no
matter
,
I
will
*NL*
give
evidence
against
myself
to-morrow
at
the
trial
.
I
'm
determined
to
!
I
*NL*
shall
tell
everything

everything

But
we
'll
make
our
appearance
together

And
whatever
you
may
say
against
me
at
the
trial
,
whatever
evidence
you
*NL*
give
,
I
'll
face
it
;
I
am
not
afraid
of
you

I
'll
confirm
it
all
myself
!
*NL*
But
you
must
confess

too
!
You
must

you
must
;
we
'll
go
together

That
's
*NL*
how
it
shall
be

*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
said
this
solemnly
and
resolutely
and
from
his
flashing
eyes
alone
it
*NL*
could
be
seen
that
it
would
be
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
ill
,
I
see
;
you
are
quite
ill
.
Your
eyes
are
yellow

''
Smerdyakov
*NL*
commented
,
without
the
least
irony
,
with
apparent
sympathy
in
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
together

''
Ivan
repeated
.
``
And
if
you
wo
n't
go

no
matter

I
'll
*NL*
go
alone

*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
paused
as
though
pondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
'll
be
nothing
of
the
sort

and
you

he
concluded
at
last
*NL*
positively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't

Ivan
exclaimed
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be

much
ashamed

what
's
more

will
be
no
use
at
all

I
shall
say
straight
out
that
I
never
said

that
you
are
either
ill

have
invented

've
always
thought
no
more

been
a
fly

who
will

believe
you

and
what
single
proof
have
you
got
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
you
showed
me
those
notes
just
now
to
convince
me

*NL*
*NL*
Smerdyakov
lifted
the
book
off
the
notes
and
laid
it
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
that
money
away
with
you
,

Smerdyakov
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
shall
take
it

But
why
do
you
give
it
to
me
,
if
you
*NL*
committed
the
murder
for
the
sake
of
it
?

Ivan
looked
at
him
with
great
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
,
''
Smerdyakov
articulated
in
a
shaking
voice
,
with
a
*NL*
gesture
of
refusal
.
``
I
did
have
an
idea
of
beginning
a
new
life
with
that
*NL*
money
in
Moscow
or
,
better
still

abroad
.
I
did
dream
of
it
,
chiefly
*NL*
because
`
all
things
are
lawful
.
'
That
was
quite
right
what
you
taught
me
,
*NL*
for
you
talked
a
lot
to
me
about
that
.
For
if
there
's
no
everlasting
God

*NL*
there
's
no
such
thing
as
virtue
,
and
there
's
no
need
of
it

You
were
right
*NL*
there

So
that
's
how
I
looked
at
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
come
to
that
of
yourself

Ivan

with
a
wry
smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
your
guidance

now

``
No

Smerdyakov

``
Then

it
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off
...
that
's
enough
!
''
Smerdyakov
waved
his
hand
again
.
``
You
used
*NL*
to
say
yourself
that
everything
was
lawful
,
so
now
why
are
you
so
upset
,
*NL*
too
?
You
even
want
to
go
and
give
evidence
against
yourself
...
Only
*NL*
there
'll
be
nothing
of
the
sort
!
You
wo
n't
go
to
give
evidence
,
''
*NL*
Smerdyakov
decided
with
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
,
''
said
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
possible
.
You
are
very
clever
.
You
are
fond
of
money
,
I
know
*NL*
that
.
You
like
to
be
respected
,
too
,
for
you
're
very
proud
;
you
are
far
*NL*
too
fond
of
female
charms
,
too
,
and
you
mind
most
of
all
about
living
in
*NL*
undisturbed
comfort
,
without
having
to
depend
on
any
one
--
that
's
what
you
*NL*
care
most
about
.
You
wo
n't
want
to
spoil
your
life
for
ever
by
taking
such
*NL*
a
disgrace
on
yourself
.
You
are
like
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
you
are
more
like
*NL*
him
than
any
of
his
children

you

the
same
soul

he
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
a
fool
,
''
said
Ivan
,
seeming
struck
.
The
blood
rushed
to
his
*NL*
face
.
``
You
are
serious
now
!
''
he
observed
,
looking
suddenly
at
Smerdyakov
*NL*
with
a
different
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
your
pride
made
you
think
I
was
a
fool
.
Take
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
took
the
three
rolls
of
notes
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
without
*NL*
wrapping
them
in
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
show
them
at
the
court
to-morrow
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
will
believe
you
,
as
you
've
plenty
of
money
of
your
own
;
you
may
*NL*
simply
have
taken
it
out
of
your
cash-box
and
brought
it
to
the
court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
rose
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
only
reason
I
have
n't
killed
you
is
that
I
need
*NL*
you
for
to-morrow

do
n't

it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
kill
me
.
Kill
me
now
,
''
Smerdyakov
said
,
all
at
once
looking
*NL*
strangely
at
Ivan
.
``
You
wo
n't
dare
do
that
even
!
''
he
added
,
with
a
bitter
*NL*
smile
.
``
You
wo
n't
dare

you

who
used
to
be
so
bold

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
to-morrow
,
''
cried
Ivan
,
and
moved
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
moment
...
Show
me
those
notes
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
took
out
the
notes
and
showed
them
to
him
.
Smerdyakov
looked
at
them
*NL*
for
ten
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
go
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
.
``
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
!
''
*NL*
he
called
after
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
Ivan
turned
without
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
to-morrow
!
''
Ivan
cried
again
,
and
he
walked
out
of
the
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snowstorm
was
still
raging
.
He
walked
the
first
few
steps
boldly
,
but
*NL*
suddenly
began
staggering
.
``
It
's
something
physical
,
''
he
thought
with
a
*NL*
grin
.
Something
like
joy
was
springing
up
in
his
heart
.
He
was
conscious
*NL*
of
unbounded
resolution
;
he
would
make
an
end
of
the
wavering
that
had
so
*NL*
tortured
him
of
late
.
His
determination
was
taken
,
``
and
now
it
will
not
be
*NL*
changed
,
''
he
thought
with
relief
.
At
that
moment
he
stumbled
against
*NL*
something
and
almost
fell
down
.
Stopping
short
,
he
made
out
at
his
feet
*NL*
the
peasant
he
had
knocked
down
,
still
lying
senseless
and
motionless
.
The
*NL*
snow
had
almost
covered
his
face
.
Ivan
seized
him
and
lifted
him
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
Seeing
a
light
in
the
little
house
to
the
right
he
went
up
,
knocked
*NL*
at
the
shutters
,
and
asked
the
man
to
whom
the
house
belonged
to
help
him
*NL*
carry
the
peasant
to
the
police-station
,
promising
him
three
roubles
.
The
*NL*
man
got
ready
and
came
out
.
I
wo
n't
describe
in
detail
how
Ivan
succeeded
*NL*
in
his
object
,
bringing
the
peasant
to
the
police-station
and
arranging
*NL*
for
a
doctor
to
see
him
at
once
,
providing
with
a
liberal
hand
for
the
*NL*
expenses
.
I
will
only
say
that
this
business
took
a
whole
hour
,
but
Ivan
*NL*
was
well
content
with
it
.
His
mind
wandered
and
worked
incessantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
not
taken
my
decision
so
firmly
for
to-morrow
,
''
he
reflected
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
``
I
should
not
have
stayed
a
whole
hour
to
look
after
*NL*
the
peasant
,
but
should
have
passed
by
,
without
caring
about
his
being
*NL*
frozen
.
I
am
quite
capable
of
watching
myself
,
by
the
way
,
''
he
thought
at
*NL*
the
same
instant
,
with
still
greater
satisfaction
,
``
although
they
have
*NL*
decided
that
I
am
going
out
of
my
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
he
reached
his
own
house
he
stopped
short
,
asking
himself
suddenly
*NL*
had
n't
he
better
go
at
once
to
the
prosecutor
and
tell
him
everything
.
He
*NL*
decided
the
question
by
turning
back
to
the
house
.
``
Everything
together
*NL*
to-morrow
!
''
he
whispered
to
himself
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
almost
all
his
*NL*
gladness
and
self-satisfaction
passed
in
one
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
entered
his
own
room
he
felt
something
like
a
touch
of
ice
on
his
*NL*
heart
,
like
a
recollection
or
,
more
exactly
,
a
reminder
,
of
something
*NL*
agonizing
and
revolting
that
was
in
that
room
now
,
at
that
moment
,
and
had
*NL*
been
there
before
.
He
sank
wearily
on
his
sofa
.
The
old
woman
brought
him
*NL*
a
samovar
;
he
made
tea
,
but
did
not
touch
it
.
He
sat
on
the
sofa
and
felt
*NL*
giddy
.
He
felt
that
he
was
ill
and
helpless
.
He
was
beginning
to
drop
*NL*
asleep
,
but
got
up
uneasily
and
walked
across
the
room
to
shake
off
his
*NL*
drowsiness
.
At
moments
he
fancied
he
was
delirious
,
but
it
was
not
illness
*NL*
that
he
thought
of
most
.
Sitting
down
again
,
he
began
looking
round
,
as
*NL*
though
searching
for
something
.
This
happened
several
times
.
At
last
his
*NL*
eyes
were
fastened
intently
on
one
point
.
Ivan
smiled
,
but
an
angry
flush
*NL*
suffused
his
face
.
He
sat
a
long
time
in
his
place
,
his
head
propped
on
*NL*
both
arms
,
though
he
looked
sideways
at
the
same
point
,
at
the
sofa
that
*NL*
stood
against
the
opposite
wall
.
There
was
evidently
something
,
some
*NL*
object
,
that
irritated
him
there
,
worried
him
and
tormented
him
.

Chapter
IX
.
The
Devil
.
Ivan
's
Nightmare
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
a
doctor
,
but
yet
I
feel
that
the
moment
has
come
when
I
must
*NL*
inevitably
give
the
reader
some
account
of
the
nature
of
Ivan
's
illness
.
*NL*
Anticipating
events
I
can
say
at
least
one
thing
:
he
was
at
that
moment
on
*NL*
the
very
eve
of
an
attack
of
brain
fever
.
Though
his
health
had
long
been
*NL*
affected
,
it
had
offered
a
stubborn
resistance
to
the
fever
which
in
the
*NL*
end
gained
complete
mastery
over
it
.
Though
I
know
nothing
of
medicine
,
I
*NL*
venture
to
hazard
the
suggestion
that
he
really
had
perhaps
,
by
a
terrible
*NL*
effort
of
will
,
succeeded
in
delaying
the
attack
for
a
time
,
hoping
,
of
*NL*
course
,
to
check
it
completely
.
He
knew
that
he
was
unwell
,
but
he
loathed
*NL*
the
thought
of
being
ill
at
that
fatal
time
,
at
the
approaching
crisis
in
*NL*
his
life
,
when
he
needed
to
have
all
his
wits
about
him
,
to
say
what
he
*NL*
had
to
say
boldly
and
resolutely
and
``
to
justify
himself
to
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
however
,
consulted
the
new
doctor
,
who
had
been
brought
from
*NL*
Moscow
by
a
fantastic
notion
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
to
which
I
have
*NL*
referred
already
.
After
listening
to
him
and
examining
him
the
doctor
came
*NL*
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
actually
suffering
from
some
disorder
of
the
*NL*
brain
,
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
by
an
admission
which
Ivan
had
*NL*
reluctantly
made
him
.
``
Hallucinations
are
quite
likely
in
your
condition
,
''
*NL*
the
doctor
opined
,
``
though
it
would
be
better
to
verify
them
...
you
must
*NL*
take
steps
at
once
,
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
or
things
will
go
badly
with
*NL*
you
.
''
But
Ivan
did
not
follow
this
judicious
advice
and
did
not
take
to
*NL*
his
bed
to
be
nursed
.
``
I
am
walking
about
,
so
I
am
strong
enough
,
if
I
*NL*
drop
,
it
'll
be
different
then
,
any
one
may
nurse
me
who
likes
,
''
he
*NL*
decided
,
dismissing
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
was
sitting
almost
conscious
himself
of
his
delirium
and
,
as
I
*NL*
have
said
already
,
looking
persistently
at
some
object
on
the
sofa
against
*NL*
the
opposite
wall
.
Some
one
appeared
to
be
sitting
there
,
though
goodness
*NL*
knows
how
he
had
come
in
,
for
he
had
not
been
in
the
room
when
Ivan
came
*NL*
into
it
,
on
his
return
from
Smerdyakov
.
This
was
a
person
or
,
more
*NL*
accurately
speaking
,
a
Russian
gentleman
of
a
particular
kind
,
no
longer
*NL*
young
,
_
qui
faisait
la
cinquantaine
_
,
as
the
French
say
,
with
rather
long
,
*NL*
still
thick
,
dark
hair
,
slightly
streaked
with
gray
and
a
small
pointed
*NL*
beard
.
He
was
wearing
a
brownish
reefer
jacket
,
rather
shabby
,
evidently
*NL*
made
by
a
good
tailor
though
,
and
of
a
fashion
at
least
three
years
old
,
*NL*
that
had
been
discarded
by
smart
and
well-to-do
people
for
the
last
two
*NL*
years
.
His
linen
and
his
long
scarf-like
neck-tie
were
all
such
as
are
*NL*
worn
by
people
who
aim
at
being
stylish
,
but
on
closer
inspection
his
*NL*
linen
was
not
over-clean
and
his
wide
scarf
was
very
threadbare
.
The
*NL*
visitor
's
check
trousers
were
of
excellent
cut
,
but
were
too
light
in
*NL*
color
and
too
tight
for
the
present
fashion
.
His
soft
fluffy
white
hat
was
*NL*
out
of
keeping
with
the
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
brief
there
was
every
appearance
of
gentility
on
straitened
means
.
It
*NL*
looked
as
though
the
gentleman
belonged
to
that
class
of
idle
landowners
*NL*
who
used
to
flourish
in
the
times
of
serfdom
.
He
had
unmistakably
been
,
at
*NL*
some
time
,
in
good
and
fashionable
society
,
had
once
had
good
connections
,
*NL*
had
possibly
preserved
them
indeed
,
but
,
after
a
gay
youth
,
becoming
*NL*
gradually
impoverished
on
the
abolition
of
serfdom
,
he
had
sunk
into
the
*NL*
position
of
a
poor
relation
of
the
best
class
,
wandering
from
one
good
old
*NL*
friend
to
another
and
received
by
them
for
his
companionable
and
*NL*
accommodating
disposition
and
as
being
,
after
all
,
a
gentleman
who
could
*NL*
be
asked
to
sit
down
with
any
one
,
though
,
of
course
,
not
in
a
place
of
*NL*
honor
.
Such
gentlemen
of
accommodating
temper
and
dependent
position
,
who
*NL*
can
tell
a
story
,
take
a
hand
at
cards
,
and
who
have
a
distinct
aversion
*NL*
for
any
duties
that
may
be
forced
upon
them
,
are
usually
solitary
*NL*
creatures
,
either
bachelors
or
widowers
.
Sometimes
they
have
children
,
but
*NL*
if
so
,
the
children
are
always
being
brought
up
at
a
distance
,
at
some
*NL*
aunt
's
,
to
whom
these
gentlemen
never
allude
in
good
society
,
seeming
*NL*
ashamed
of
the
relationship
.
They
gradually
lose
sight
of
their
children
*NL*
altogether
,
though
at
intervals
they
receive
a
birthday
or
Christmas
*NL*
letter
from
them
and
sometimes
even
answer
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countenance
of
the
unexpected
visitor
was
not
so
much
good-natured
,
as
*NL*
accommodating
and
ready
to
assume
any
amiable
expression
as
occasion
might
*NL*
arise
.
He
had
no
watch
,
but
he
had
a
tortoise-shell
lorgnette
on
a
black
*NL*
ribbon
.
On
the
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
was
a
massive
gold
ring
*NL*
with
a
cheap
opal
stone
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
was
angrily
silent
and
would
not
begin
the
conversation
.
The
visitor
*NL*
waited
and
sat
exactly
like
a
poor
relation
who
had
come
down
from
his
*NL*
room
to
keep
his
host
company
at
tea
,
and
was
discreetly
silent
,
seeing
*NL*
that
his
host
was
frowning
and
preoccupied
.
But
he
was
ready
for
any
*NL*
affable
conversation
as
soon
as
his
host
should
begin
it
.
All
at
once
his
*NL*
face
expressed
a
sudden
solicitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
he
began
to
Ivan
,
``
excuse
me
,
I
only
mention
it
to
remind
you
.
*NL*
You
went
to
Smerdyakov
's
to
find
out
about
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
but
you
came
*NL*
away
without
finding
out
anything
about
her
,
you
probably
forgot
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
broke
from
Ivan
and
his
face
grew
gloomy
with
uneasiness
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
I
'd
forgotten
...
but
it
does
n't
matter
now
,
never
mind
,
till
to-morrow
,
''
*NL*
he
muttered
to
himself
,
``
and
you
,
''
he
added
,
addressing
his
visitor
,
``
I
*NL*
should
have
remembered
that
myself
in
a
minute
,
for
that
was
just
what
was
*NL*
tormenting
me
!
Why
do
you
interfere
,
as
if
I
should
believe
that
you
*NL*
prompted
me
,
and
that
I
did
n't
remember
it
of
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
believe
it
then
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
smiling
amicably

``
what
's
the
*NL*
good
of
believing
against
your
will
?
Besides
,
proofs
are
no
help
to
*NL*
believing
,
especially
material
proofs
.
Thomas
believed
,
not
because
he
saw
*NL*
Christ
risen
,
but
because
he
wanted
to
believe
,
before
he
saw
.
Look
at
the
*NL*
spiritualists
,
for
instance
...
I
am
very
fond
of
them
...
only
fancy
,
*NL*
they
imagine
that
they
are
serving
the
cause
of
religion
,
because
the
*NL*
devils
show
them
their
horns
from
the
other
world
.
That
,
they
say
,
is
a
*NL*
material
proof
,
so
to
speak
,
of
the
existence
of
another
world
.
The
other
*NL*
world
and
material
proofs
,
what
next
!
And
if
you
come
to
that
,
does
*NL*
proving
there
's
a
devil
prove
that
there
's
a
God
?
I
want
to
join
an
*NL*
idealist
society
,
I
'll
lead
the
opposition
in
it
,
I
'll
say
I
am
a
realist
,
*NL*
but
not
a
materialist

he
he
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Ivan
suddenly
got
up
from
the
table
.
``
I
seem
to
be

*NL*
I

You

But
I
feel
somehow

I
want
to
walk
about

I
sometimes
do

see
you

do

even
hear
your

I

for

I
myself

know
whether

whether
I
really
saw

I
'll
*NL*
wet
a

put
it
on
my

perhaps
you
'll
vanish
into
air

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
went
into
the
corner
,
took
a
towel
,
and
did
as
he
said
,
and
with
a
*NL*
wet
towel
on
his
head
began
walking
up

down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the

began

*NL*
*NL*
``

laughed
Ivan
,

By
the
way

I
am
listening
to
you

am
rather
surprised
to
find
you
are
actually
beginning
to
take
me
for
*NL*
something
real
,
not
simply
your
fancy
,
as
you
persisted
in
declaring
last
*NL*
time
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
for
one
minute
have
I
taken
you
for
reality

''
Ivan
cried
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
fury
.
``
You
are
a
lie
,
you
are
my
illness
,
you
are
a
phantom
.
It
's
*NL*
only
that
I
do
n't
know
how
to
destroy
you
and
I
see
I
must
suffer
for
a
*NL*
time
.
You
are
my
hallucination
.
You
are
the
incarnation
of
myself
,
but
*NL*
only
of
one
side
of
me
...
of
my
thoughts
and
feelings
,
but
only
the
*NL*
nastiest
and
stupidest
of
them

From
that
point

you
might
be
of

waste
on

*NL*
``
Excuse

When
you
flew
out
at
Alyosha
under
*NL*
the
lamp-post
this
evening
and
shouted
to
him
,
`
You
learnt
it
from

*NL*
How
do
you
know

you
were
thinking
of
me
then

So
for
*NL*
one
brief
moment
you
did
believe
that
I
really
exist

the
gentleman
*NL*
laughed
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
was
a
moment
of
weakness

I

I

know
whether
I
was
asleep

awake
last

I
was
only

dreaming
then

you
really
at
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
were
you
so
surly
with

him
badly

again

*NL*
``
You
scold
me

you

more
polite

*NL*
*NL*

Ivan
laughed
again

only

``

all

the

declared

with
delicacy

put
up
with

you
!
What
am
I
to
do
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
Ivan
said
through
his
clenched
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
above
all
things
I
want
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
to
*NL*
be
recognized
as
such
,
''
the
visitor
began
in
an
excess
of
deprecating
and
*NL*
simple-hearted
pride
,
typical
of
a
poor
relation
.
``
I
am
poor
,
but
...
I
*NL*
wo
n't
say
very
honest
,
but
...
it
's
an
axiom
generally
accepted
in
society
*NL*
that
I
am
a
fallen
angel
.
I
certainly
ca
n't
conceive
how
I
can
ever
have
*NL*
been
an
angel
.
If
I
ever
was
,
it
must
have
been
so
long
ago
that
there
's
*NL*
no
harm
in
forgetting
it
.
Now
I
only
prize
the
reputation
of
being
a
*NL*
gentlemanly
person
and
live
as
I
can
,
trying
to
make
myself
agreeable
.
I
*NL*
love
men
genuinely
,
I
've
been
greatly
calumniated
!
Here
when
I
stay
with
*NL*
you
from
time
to
time
,
my
life
gains
a
kind
of
reality
and
that
's
what
I
*NL*
like
most
of
all
.
You
see
,
like
you
,
I
suffer
from
the
fantastic
and
so
I
*NL*
love
the
realism
of
earth
.
Here
,
with
you
,
everything
is
circumscribed
,
*NL*
here
all
is
formulated
and
geometrical
,
while
we
have
nothing
but
*NL*
indeterminate
equations
!
I
wander
about
here
dreaming
.
I
like
dreaming
.
*NL*
Besides
,
on
earth
I
become
superstitious
.
Please
do
n't
laugh
,
that
's
just
*NL*
what
I
like
,
to
become
superstitious
.
I
adopt
all
your
habits
here
:
I
've
*NL*
grown
fond
of
going
to
the
public
baths
,
would
you
believe
it
?
and
I
go
*NL*
and
steam
myself
with
merchants
and
priests
.
What
I
dream
of
is
becoming
*NL*
incarnate
once
for
all
and
irrevocably
in
the
form
of
some
merchant
's
wife
*NL*
weighing
eighteen
stone
,
and
of
believing
all
she
believes
.
My
ideal
is
to
*NL*
go
to
church
and
offer
a
candle
in
simple-hearted
faith
,
upon
my
word
it
*NL*
is
.
Then
there
would
be
an
end
to
my
sufferings
.
I
like
being
doctored
*NL*
too
;
in
the
spring
there
was
an
outbreak
of
smallpox
and
I
went
and
was
*NL*
vaccinated
in
a
foundling
hospital
--
if
only
you
knew
how
I
enjoyed
myself
*NL*
that
day
.
I
subscribed
ten
roubles
in
the
cause
of
the
Slavs
!
...
But
you
*NL*
are
not
listening
.
Do
you
know
,
you
are
not
at
all
well
this
evening
?
I
*NL*
know
you
went
yesterday
to
that
doctor
...
well
,
what
about
your
health
?
*NL*
What
did
the
doctor
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
!

Ivan
snapped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
clever
,
anyway

You
are
scolding
again
?
I
did
n't
ask
out
of
*NL*
sympathy
.
You
need
n't
answer

Now
rheumatism
has
come
in
again

*NL*
*NL*
``

repeated
Ivan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
keep

the

it

consequences

Ivan
stopped
suddenly
,
seeming
struck
.
*NL*
``

never
entered
my

that
's
strange

_
C'est

ce
pas

_
This
time
I
'll
act
honestly
and
explain
*NL*
to
you
.
Listen
,
in
dreams
and
especially
in
nightmares
,
from
indigestion
*NL*
or
anything
,
a
man
sees
sometimes
such
artistic
visions
,
such
complex
and
*NL*
real
actuality
,
such
events
,
even
a
whole
world
of
events
,
woven
into
such
*NL*
a
plot
,
with
such
unexpected
details
from
the
most
exalted
matters
to
the
*NL*
last
button
on
a
cuff
,
as
I
swear
Leo
Tolstoy
has
never
invented
.
Yet
such
*NL*
dreams
are
sometimes
seen
not
by
writers
,
but
by
the
most
ordinary
people
,
*NL*
officials
,
journalists
,
priests
...
The
subject
is
a
complete
enigma
.
A
*NL*
statesman
confessed
to
me
,
indeed
,
that
all
his
best
ideas
came
to
him
*NL*
when
he
was
asleep
.
Well
,
that
's
how
it
is
now
,
though
I
am
your
*NL*
hallucination
,
yet
just
as
in
a
nightmare
,
I
say
original
things
which
had
*NL*
not
entered
your
head
before
.
So
I
do
n't
repeat
your
ideas
,
yet
I
am
only
*NL*
your
nightmare
,
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lying
,
your
aim
is
to
convince
me
you
exist
apart
and
are
not
my
*NL*
nightmare

now
you
are
asserting
you
are
a
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
've
adopted
a
special
method
to-day
,
I
'll
explain
it
to
*NL*
you
afterwards
.
Stay
,
where
did
I
break
off
?
Oh
,
yes
!
I
caught
cold
then
,
*NL*
only
not
here
but
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
yonder
?
Tell
me
,
will
you
be
here
long
?
Ca
n't
you
go
away
?
''
Ivan
*NL*
exclaimed
almost
in
despair
.
He
ceased
walking
to
and
fro
,
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
again
and
held
his
head
tight
in
both
*NL*
hands
.
He
pulled
the
wet
towel
off
and
flung
it
away
in
vexation
.
It
was
*NL*
evidently
of
no
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
nerves
are
out
of
order
,
''
observed
the
gentleman
,
with
a
carelessly
*NL*
easy
,
though
perfectly
polite
,
air
.
``
You
are
angry
with
me
even
for
being
*NL*
able
to
catch
cold
,
though
it
happened
in
a
most
natural
way
.
I
was
*NL*
hurrying
then
to
a
diplomatic
_
soiree
_
at
the
house
of
a
lady
of
high
rank
*NL*
in
Petersburg
,
who
was
aiming
at
influence
in
the
Ministry
.
Well
,
an
*NL*
evening
suit
,
white
tie
,
gloves
,
though
I
was
God
knows
where
and
had
to
*NL*
fly
through
space
to
reach
your
earth
...
Of
course
,
it
took
only
an
*NL*
instant
,
but
you
know
a
ray
of
light
from
the
sun
takes
full
eight
*NL*
minutes
,
and
fancy
in
an
evening
suit
and
open
waistcoat
.
Spirits
do
n't
*NL*
freeze
,
but
when
one
's
in
fleshly
form
,
well
...
in
brief
,
I
did
n't
think
,
*NL*
and
set
off
,
and
you
know
in
those
ethereal
spaces
,
in
the
water
that
is
*NL*
above
the
firmament
,
there
's
such
a
frost
...
at
least
one
ca
n't
call
it
*NL*
frost
,
you
can
fancy
,
150
degrees
below
zero
!
You
know
the
game
the
*NL*
village
girls
play
--
they
invite
the
unwary
to
lick
an
ax
in
thirty
degrees
*NL*
of
frost
,
the
tongue
instantly
freezes
to
it
and
the
dupe
tears
the
skin
*NL*
off
,
so
it
bleeds
.
But
that
's
only
in

your

And
can
there

Ivan
interrupted
,
carelessly

*NL*
disdainfully
.
He
was
exerting
himself
to
the

not
to
believe
in
the
*NL*
delusion

not
to
sink
into
complete
insanity

Yes

Ivan
cried
suddenly

of
savage
and
insistent
obstinacy
.

*NL*
``

If

it

begin

I
think

flying
round
the
earth
without

The

calculate

the

of

There

then

sending

they
say
,

go
to
such-and-such

The
old

who
used
to
cure
all

has
completely
disappeared
,
I
assure
you
,
now
there
are
only
*NL*
specialists
and
they
all
advertise
in
the
newspapers

If
anything
is
wrong
*NL*
with
your
nose
,
they
send
you
to
Paris
:
there
,
they
say
,
is
a
European
*NL*
specialist

cures
noses

If
you
go
to
Paris
,
he
'll
look
at
your
nose
;
I
*NL*
can
only
cure
your
right
nostril
,
he
'll
tell
you
,
for
I
do
n't
cure
the
*NL*
left
nostril
,
that
's
not

go
to
Vienna

What
are
you
to
do
?
I
fell
*NL*
back
on
popular
remedies
,
a
German
doctor
advised
me
to
rub
myself
with
*NL*
honey
and
salt
in
the
bath-house
.
Solely
to
get
an
extra
bath
I
went
,
*NL*
smeared
myself
all
over
and
it
did
me
no
good
at
all
.
In
despair
I
wrote
*NL*
to
Count
Mattei
in
Milan
.
He
sent
me
a
book
and
some
drops
,
bless
him
,
*NL*
and
,
only
fancy
,
Hoff
's
malt
extract
cured
me
!
I
bought
it
by
accident
,
*NL*
drank
a
bottle
and
a
half
of
it
,
and
I
was
ready
to
dance
,
it
took
it
away
*NL*
completely
.
I
made
up
my
mind
to
write
to
the
papers
to
thank
him
,
I
was
*NL*
prompted
by
a
feeling
of
gratitude
,
and
only
fancy
,
it
led
to
no
end
of
a
*NL*
bother
:
not
a
single
paper
would
take
my
letter
.
`
It
would
be
very
*NL*
reactionary
,
'
they
said
,
`
no
one
will
believe
it
.
_
Le
diable

_
You
'd
better
remain
anonymous
,
'
they
advised
me
.
What
use
is
a
*NL*
letter
of
thanks
if
it
's
anonymous
?
I
laughed
with
the
men
at
the
*NL*
newspaper
office
;
`
It
's
reactionary
to
believe
in
God
in
our
days

'
I
*NL*
said
,
`
but
I
am
the
devil

so
I
may
be

'
`
We
quite
understand
*NL*
that
,
'
they
said
.
`
Who
does
n't
believe
in

devil

Yet
it
wo
n't
do
,
it
*NL*
might
injure
our
reputation

As
a
joke
,
if
you
like
.
'
But
I
thought
as
a
*NL*
joke
it
would
n't
be
very
witty
.
So
it
was
n't
printed
.
And
do
you
know
,
I
*NL*
have
felt
sore
about
it
to
this
day
.
My
best
feelings
,
gratitude
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
are
literally
denied
me
simply
from
my
social
position
.

``
Philosophical

Ivan
snarled
malignantly
.

*NL*
``
God

complaining

I

man

You
upbraid
me
every
moment
with
being
stupid

One
can
see
*NL*
you
are
young
.
My
dear
fellow
,
intelligence
is
n't
the
only
thing
!
I
have
*NL*
naturally
a
kind
and
merry
heart
.
'
I
also
write
vaudevilles
of
all
sorts

'
*NL*
You
seem
to
take
me
for
Hlestakov
grown
old
,
but
my
fate
is
a
far
more
*NL*
serious
one
.
Before
time
was
,
by
some
decree
which
I
could
never
make
out
,
*NL*
I
was
pre-destined
`
to
deny
'
and
yet
I
am
genuinely
good-hearted
and
not
*NL*
at
all
inclined
to
negation
.
`
No
,
you
must
go
and
deny
,
without
denial
*NL*
there
's
no
criticism
and
what
would
a
journal
be
without
a
column
of
*NL*
criticism
?
'
Without
criticism
it
would
be
nothing
but
one
`
hosannah
.
'
But
*NL*
nothing
but
hosannah
is
not
enough
for
life
,
the
hosannah
must
be
tried
in
*NL*
the
crucible
of
doubt
and
so
on
,
in
the
same
style
.
But
I
do
n't
meddle
in
*NL*
that
,
I
did
n't
create
it
,
I
am
not
answerable
for
it
.
Well
,
they
've
chosen
*NL*
their
scapegoat
,
they
've
made
me
write
the
column
of
criticism
and
so
life
*NL*
was
made
possible
.
We
understand
that
comedy
;
I
,
for
instance
,
simply
ask
*NL*
for
annihilation
.
No
,
live
,
I
am
told
,
for
there
'd
be
nothing
without
you
.
*NL*
If
everything
in
the
universe
were
sensible
,
nothing
would
happen
.
There
*NL*
would
be
no
events
without
you
,
and
there
must
be
events
.
So
against
the
*NL*
grain
I
serve
to
produce
events
and
do
what
's
irrational
because
I
am
*NL*
commanded
to
.
For
all
their
indisputable
intelligence
,
men
take
this
farce
*NL*
as
something
serious
,
and
that
is
their
tragedy
.
They
suffer
,
of
course
*NL*
...
but
then
they
live
,
they
live
a
real
life
,
not
a
fantastic
one
,
for
*NL*
suffering
is
life
.
Without
suffering
what
would
be
the
pleasure
of
it
?
It
*NL*
would
be
transformed
into
an
endless
church
service
;
it
would
be
holy
,
but
*NL*
tedious
.
But
what
about
me
?
I
suffer
,
but
still
,
I
do
n't
live
.
I
am
x
in
*NL*
an
indeterminate
equation
.
I
am
a
sort
of
phantom
in
life
who
has
lost
all
*NL*
beginning

end
,
and
who
has
even
forgotten
his
own

You

no

not

you
are
angry
again

You
are
for

I
repeat
again
that
I

give

super-stellar

all
the
ranks

simply
to
*NL*
be
transformed
into

when

out

two

my

a

the
sort
of

we
have
on

even
now

Ivan
cried

with
an
almost
childish

succeeded

remembering
something
at

``
That
anecdote
about

the

I
made
up

I
was
seventeen

I
was
at

the

I
made
up
that
anecdote
and
told
it
to
a
schoolfellow

called
Korovkin

it
was
at
Moscow

The
anecdote
is
so
characteristic

taken
it
from
anywhere

I
thought
I

I

unconsciously
recalled

I
recalled

myself

it
was
not

Thousands

things
are
unconsciously

even
when

*NL*
``
Just
so

hesitation

sometimes
such

conscientious

such

administered
some

I

My

genuine

casuistry

I

that
it
all
happened
word
for
word
as
*NL*
I
've
told

It
happened
lately
and
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble

The
*NL*
unhappy
young

shot
himself
that
very
night

my

diversion

moments

Here
's
another
*NL*
incident
that
happened
only
the
other
day

A
little
blonde
Norman
girl
of
*NL*
twenty
--
a
buxom
,
unsophisticated
beauty
that
would
make
your
mouth
*NL*
water
--
comes
to
an
old
priest
.
She
bends
down
and
whispers
her
sin
into
the
*NL*
grating
.
`
Why
,
my
daughter
,
have
you
fallen
again
already
?
'
cries
the
*NL*
priest

'
O
Sancta
Maria
,
what
do
I
hear
!
Not
the
same
man
this
time
,
how
*NL*
long
is
this
going
on
?
Are
n't
you
ashamed
!
'
'
_
Ah
,
mon
pere

answers
the
*NL*
sinner
with
tears
of
penitence

ca

fait
tant
de

et
a
moi
si
*NL*
peu

_
'
Fancy
,
such
an
answer
!
I
drew
back
.
It
was
the
cry
of
*NL*
nature
,
better
than
innocence
itself
,
if
you
like
.
I
absolved
her
sin
on
*NL*
the
spot
and
was
turning
to
go
,
but
I
was
forced
to
turn
back
.
I
heard
the
*NL*
priest
at
the
grating
making
an
appointment
with
her
for
the
*NL*
evening
--
though
he
was
an
old
man
hard
as
flint
,
he
fell
in
an
instant
!
It
*NL*
was
nature
,
the
truth
of
nature
asserted
its
rights

What
,
you
are
turning
*NL*
up
your
nose
again

Angry
again

I
do

how
to

Ivan
moaned
miserably
,
helpless
before
his
apparition

``

impressively

``
You

with

lightning
,
with
scorched
*NL*
wings

but
have
shown
myself
in
such
a
modest
form

You
are
wounded

in
*NL*
the
first
place

in
your
esthetic
feelings

and
,
secondly
,
in
your
pride

*NL*
How
could
such
a
vulgar
devil
visit
such
a
great
man
as
you
!
Yes
,
there
is
*NL*
that
romantic
strain
in
you
,
that
was
so
derided
by
Byelinsky
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
it
,
young
man
,
as
I
got
ready
to
come
to
you
I
did
think
as
a
joke
of
*NL*
appearing
in
the
figure
of
a
retired
general
who
had
served
in
the
*NL*
Caucasus
,
with
a
star
of
the
Lion
and
the
Sun
on
my
coat
.
But
I
was
*NL*
positively
afraid
of
doing
it
,
for
you
'd
have
thrashed
me
for
daring
to
*NL*
pin
the
Lion
and
the
Sun
on
my
coat
,
instead
of
,
at
least
,
the
Polar
Star
*NL*
or
the
Sirius
.
And
you
keep
on
saying
I
am
stupid
,
but
,
mercy
on
us
!
I
*NL*
make
no
claim
to
be
equal
to
you
in
intelligence
.
Mephistopheles
declared
*NL*
to
Faust
that
he
desired
evil
,
but
did
only
good
.
Well
,
he
can
say
what
he
*NL*
likes
,
it
's
quite
the
opposite
with
me
.
I
am
perhaps
the
one
man
in
all
*NL*
creation
who
loves
the
truth
and
genuinely
desires
good
.
I
was
there
when
*NL*
the
Word
,
Who
died
on
the
Cross
,
rose
up
into
heaven
bearing
on
His
bosom
*NL*
the
soul
of
the
penitent
thief
.
I
heard
the
glad
shrieks
of
the
cherubim
*NL*
singing
and
shouting
hosannah
and
the
thunderous
rapture
of
the
seraphim
*NL*
which
shook
heaven
and
all
creation
,
and
I
swear
to
you
by
all
that
's
*NL*
sacred
,
I
longed
to
join
the
choir
and
shout
hosannah
with
them
all
.
The
*NL*
word
had
almost
escaped
me
,
had
almost
broken
from
my
lips
...
you
know
*NL*
how
susceptible
and
esthetically
impressionable
I
am
.
But
common
sense
--
oh
,
*NL*
a
most
unhappy
trait
in
my
character
--
kept
me
in
due
bounds
and
I
let
the
*NL*
moment
pass
!
For
what
would
have
happened
,
I
reflected
,
what
would
have
*NL*
happened
after
my
hosannah
?
Everything
on
earth
would
have
been
*NL*
extinguished
at
once
and
no
events
could
have
occurred
.
And
so
,
solely
*NL*
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
my
social
position
,
I
was
forced
to
suppress
the
*NL*
good
moment
and
to
stick
to
my
nasty
task
.
Somebody
takes
all
the
credit
*NL*
of
what
's
good
for
Himself
,
and
nothing
but
nastiness
is
left
for
me
.
But
*NL*
I
do
n't
envy
the
honor
of
a
life
of
idle
imposture
,
I
am
not
ambitious
.
*NL*
Why
am
I
,
of
all
creatures
in
the
world
,
doomed
to
be
cursed
by
all
decent
*NL*
people
and
even
to
be
kicked
,
for
if
I
put
on
mortal
form
I
am
bound
to
*NL*
take
such
consequences
sometimes
?
I
know
,
of
course
,
there
's
a
secret
in
*NL*
it
,
but
they
wo
n't
tell
me
the
secret
for
anything
,
for
then
perhaps
,
*NL*
seeing
the
meaning
of
it
,
I
might
bawl
hosannah
,
and
the
indispensable
*NL*
minus
would
disappear
at
once
,
and
good
sense
would
reign
supreme
*NL*
throughout
the
whole
world
.
And
that
,
of
course
,
would
mean
the
end
of
*NL*
everything
,
even
of
magazines
and
newspapers
,
for
who
would
take
them
in
?
*NL*
I
know
that
at
the
end
of
all
things
I
shall
be
reconciled
.
I
,
too
,
shall
*NL*
walk
my
quadrillion
and
learn
the
secret
.
But
till
that
happens
I
am
*NL*
sulking
and
fulfill
my
destiny
though
it
's
against
the
grain
--
that
is
,
to
*NL*
ruin
thousands
for
the
sake
of
saving
one
.
How
many
souls
have
had
to
be
*NL*
ruined
and
how
many
honorable
reputations
destroyed
for
the
sake
of
that
*NL*
one
righteous
man
,
Job
,
over
whom
they
made
such
a
fool
of
me
in
old
days
!
*NL*
Yes
,
till
the
secret
is
revealed
,
there
are
two
sorts
of
truths
for
*NL*
me
--
one
,
their
truth
,
yonder
,
which
I
know
nothing
about
so
far
,
and
the
*NL*
other
my
own
.
And
there
's
no
knowing
which
will
turn
out
the
better
...
*NL*
Are
you
asleep
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might

Ivan
groaned
angrily
.
``
All
my
stupid
ideas

outgrown

*NL*
thrashed
out
long
ago

flung
aside

you

to

me
as
something
new

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
pleasing

And
I
thought
I
should
fascinate
you
by
my

literary

That
hosannah
in

really
was

was
it

then
that
ironical

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

``
My

a
young

great
lover
of
literature

art
,
the
*NL*
author
of
a
promising
poem
entitled
_
The

was
only
*NL*
thinking

him

*NL*
``
I
forbid

Ivan

crimson
*NL*
with
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the

``
You

No

excuse
me

I
will
speak

I
came
to
treat
myself
to
*NL*
that
pleasure
.
Oh
,
I
love
the
dreams
of
my
ardent
young
friends
,
quivering
*NL*
with
eagerness
for
life
!
`
There
are
new
men
,
'
you
decided
last
spring
,
*NL*
when
you
were
meaning
to
come
here
,
`
they
propose
to
destroy
everything
*NL*
and
begin
with
cannibalism
.
Stupid
fellows
!
they
did
n't
ask
my
advice
!
I
*NL*
maintain
that
nothing
need
be
destroyed
,
that
we
only
need
to
destroy
the
*NL*
idea
of
God
in
man
,
that
's
how
we
have
to
set
to
work
.
It
's
that
,
that
we
*NL*
must
begin
with
.
Oh
,
blind
race
of
men
who
have
no
understanding
!
As
soon
*NL*
as
men
have
all
of
them
denied
God
--
and
I
believe
that
period
,
analogous
*NL*
with
geological
periods
,
will
come
to
pass
--
the
old
conception
of
the
*NL*
universe
will
fall
of
itself
without
cannibalism
,
and
,
what
's
more
,
the
*NL*
old
morality
,
and
everything
will
begin
anew
.
Men
will
unite
to
take
from
*NL*
life
all
it
can
give
,
but
only
for
joy
and
happiness
in
the
present
world
.
*NL*
Man
will
be
lifted
up
with
a
spirit
of
divine
Titanic
pride
and
the
man
-
*NL*
god
will
appear
.
From
hour
to
hour
extending
his
conquest
of
nature
*NL*
infinitely
by
his
will
and
his
science
,
man
will
feel
such
lofty
joy
from
*NL*
hour
to
hour
in
doing
it
that
it
will
make
up
for
all
his
old
dreams
of
*NL*
the
joys
of
heaven
.
Every
one
will
know
that
he
is
mortal
and
will
accept
*NL*
death
proudly
and
serenely
like
a
god
.
His
pride
will
teach
him
that
it
's
*NL*
useless
for
him
to
repine
at
life
's
being
a
moment
,
and
he
will
love
his
*NL*
brother
without
need
of
reward
.
Love
will
be
sufficient
only
for
a
moment
*NL*
of
life
,
but
the
very
consciousness
of
its
momentariness
will
intensify
*NL*
its
fire
,
which
now
is
dissipated
in
dreams
of
eternal
love
beyond
the
*NL*
grave
'
...
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
the
same
style

Charming

*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
sat
with
his
eyes
on
the
floor
,
and
his
hands
pressed
to
his
ears
,
*NL*
but
he
began
trembling
all
over
.
The
voice
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
now
is
,
my
young
thinker
reflected
,
is
it
possible
that
such
*NL*
a
period
will
ever
come
?
If
it
does
,
everything
is
determined
and
humanity
*NL*
is
settled
for
ever
.
But
as
,
owing
to
man
's
inveterate
stupidity
,
this
*NL*
can
not
come
about
for
at
least
a
thousand
years
,
every
one
who
recognizes
*NL*
the
truth
even
now
may
legitimately
order
his
life
as
he
pleases
,
on
the
*NL*
new
principles
.
In
that
sense
,
`
all
things
are
lawful
'
for
him
.
What
's
*NL*
more
,
even
if
this
period
never
comes
to
pass
,
since
there
is
anyway
no
*NL*
God
and
no
immortality
,
the
new
man
may
well
become
the
man-god
,
even
if
*NL*
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
whole
world
,
and
promoted
to
his
new
position
,
*NL*
he
may
lightheartedly
overstep
all
the
barriers
of
the
old
morality
of
the
*NL*
old
slave-man
,
if
necessary
.
There
is
no
law
for
God
.
Where
God
stands
,
*NL*
the
place
is
holy
.
Where
I
stand
will
be
at
once
the
foremost
place
...
*NL*
`
all
things
are
lawful
'
and
that
's
the
end
of
it
!
That
's
all
very
*NL*
charming
;
but
if
you
want
to
swindle
why
do
you
want
a
moral
sanction
for
*NL*
doing
it
?
But
that
's
our
modern
Russian
all
over
.
He
ca
n't
bring
himself
*NL*
to
swindle
without
a
moral
sanction

He
is
so
in
love
with
truth

The
visitor
talked
,
obviously
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
,
speaking
*NL*
louder
and
louder
and
looking
ironically
at
his
host
.
But
he
did
not
*NL*
succeed
in
finishing
;
Ivan
suddenly
snatched
a
glass
from
the
table
and
*NL*
flung
it
at
the
orator

*NL*
''

jumping
up
from

shaking
the
drops

tea
off
himself

A

at

up
from

The
knocking
continued

Ivan
wanted
to
rush
to
the
window
,
but
something
*NL*
seemed
to
fetter
his
arms
and
legs

He
strained
every
effort
to
break
his
*NL*
chains
,
but
in
vain
.
The
knocking
at
the
window
grew
louder
and
louder
.
At
*NL*
last
the
chains
were
broken
and
Ivan
leapt
up
from
the
sofa
.
He
looked
*NL*
round
him
wildly
.
Both
candles
had
almost
burnt
out

the
glass
he
had
just
*NL*
thrown
at
his
visitor
stood
before
him
on
the
table
,
and
there
was
no
one
*NL*
on
the
sofa
opposite
.
The
knocking
on
the
window
frame
went
on
*NL*
persistently
,
but
it
was
by
no
means
so
loud
as
it
had
seemed
in
his
*NL*
dream
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
quite
subdued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

No

cried
Ivan

He
rushed
to
the

and
opened
the
movable
pane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha

I

coming
in

over

informed

went
in

clear
away

hanging

nail
in

wall

On
Alyosha
's
inquiring
whether
she
had
informed
the
*NL*
police

she
answered
that
she
had
told
no
one
,
``

I
flew
straight

all

She
seemed
perfectly
crazy

Alyosha
reported
,
*NL*
and
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
.
When
Alyosha
ran
with
her
to
the
cottage
,
he
*NL*
found
Smerdyakov
still
hanging

On
the
table
lay
a
note
:

*NL*
Alyosha
left
the
note
on

went
straight
to

told

all
about
it

*NL*
Alyosha
,
in
conclusion

looking
intently
into
Ivan

face

He
had
not
*NL*
taken
his
eyes
off
him
while
he
told
his
story

as
though
struck
by
*NL*
something
in

expression

Ivan
stood
in

still
spoke
in

brooding

looking
at

ground

``

I
am
asleep
.
But
he
was
sitting
here
,
on
that
sofa
there
...
He
is
*NL*
frightfully
stupid
,
Alyosha
,
frightfully
stupid
.
''
Ivan
laughed
suddenly
*NL*
and
began
pacing
about
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
stupid
?
Of
whom
are
you
talking
,
brother
?
''
Alyosha
asked
anxiously
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
He
's
taken
to
visiting
me
.
He
's
been
here
twice
,
almost
three
*NL*
times
.
He
taunted
me
with
being
angry
at
his
being
a
simple
devil
and
not
*NL*
Satan
,
with
scorched
wings
,
in
thunder
and
lightning
.
But
he
is
not
Satan
:
*NL*
that
's
a
lie
.
He
is
an
impostor
.
He
is
simply
a
devil
--
a
paltry
,
trivial
*NL*
devil
.
He
goes
to
the
baths
.
If
you
undressed
him
,
you
'd
be
sure
to
find
*NL*
he
had
a
tail
,
long
and
smooth
like
a
Danish
dog
's
,
a
yard
long
,
dun
*NL*
color
...
Alyosha
,
you
are
cold
.
You
've
been
in
the
snow
.
Would
you
like
*NL*
some
tea
?
What
?
Is
it
cold
?
Shall
I
tell
her
to
bring
some
?

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
ran
to
the
washing-stand
,
wetted
the
towel
,
persuaded
Ivan
to
sit
*NL*
down
again
,
and
put
the
wet
towel
round
his
head
.
He
sat
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
telling
me
just
now
about
Lise
?
''
Ivan
began
again
.
-LRB-
He
was
*NL*
becoming
very
talkative
.
-RRB-
``
I
like
Lise
.
I
said
something
nasty
about
her
.
*NL*
It
was
a
lie
.
I
like
her
...
I
am
afraid
for
Katya
to-morrow
.
I
am
more
*NL*
afraid
of
her
than
of
anything
.
On
account
of
the
future
.
She
will
cast
me
*NL*
off
to-morrow
and
trample
me
under
foot
.
She
thinks
that
I
am
ruining
*NL*
Mitya
from
jealousy
on
her
account
!
Yes
,
she
thinks
that
!
But
it
's
not
so
.
*NL*
To-morrow
the
cross
,
but
not
the
gallows
.
No
,
I
sha
n't
hang
myself
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
,
I
can
never
commit
suicide
,
Alyosha
.
Is
it
because
I
am
base
?
I
am
*NL*
not
a
coward
.
Is
it
from
love
of
life
?
How
did
I
know
that
Smerdyakov
had
*NL*
hanged
himself
?
Yes
,
it
was
_
he
_
told
me
so
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
quite
convinced
that
there
has
been
some
one
here
?
''
asked
*NL*
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
on
that
sofa
in
the
corner
.
You
would
have
driven
him
away
.
You
did
*NL*
drive
him
away
:
he
disappeared
when
you
arrived
.
I
love
your
face

*NL*
Alyosha

Did
you
know
that
I
loved
your

And
_
he

is
myself

Alyosha

*NL*
All
that
's
base
in
me
,
all
that
's
mean
and
contemptible
.
Yes
,
I
am
a
*NL*
romantic
.
He
guessed
it
...
though
it
's
a
libel
.
He
is
frightfully
stupid
;
*NL*
but
it
's
to
his
advantage
.
He
has
cunning
,
animal
cunning
--
he
knew
how
to
*NL*
infuriate
me
.
He
kept
taunting
me
with
believing
in
him
,
and
that
was
how
*NL*
he
made
me
listen
to
him
.
He
fooled
me
like
a
boy
.
He
told
me
a
great
deal
*NL*
that
was
true
about
myself
,
though
.
I
should
never
have
owned
it
to
*NL*
myself
.
Do
you
know
,
Alyosha
,
''
Ivan
added
in
an
intensely
earnest
and
*NL*
confidential
tone
,
``
I
should
be
awfully
glad
to
think
that
it
was
_
he

and
*NL*
not
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
worn
you
out

said
Alyosha
,
looking
compassionately
at
his
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
teasing
me

And
you
know
he
does
it
so
cleverly

so
cleverly

*NL*

Conscience
!
What
is
conscience
?
I
make
it
up
for
myself

Why
am
I
*NL*
tormented
by
it
?
From
habit

From
the
universal
habit
of
mankind
for
the
*NL*
seven
thousand
years

So
let
us
give
it
up

and
we

be

It

said
that

it
was
he
said
that
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
you

not
you

Alyosha
could
not
help
crying
,
looking
frankly
at
*NL*
his
brother
.
``
Never
mind
him

anyway

have
done
with

forget
him

*NL*
And
let
him
take
with

all
that

curse
now

never
come
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
is
spiteful

He
laughed
at
me
.
He
was
impudent

Alyosha

*NL*
Ivan
said
,
with
a
shudder
of
offense
.
``
But
he
was
unfair
to
me

unfair
to

me
about
lots

to
my

`
Oh

's
what

tortures
you

makes

angry

why

so
vindictive

He
*NL*
said
that
to
me
about
me

he
knows
what
he
says

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
you
say
that

not
he

exclaimed
Alyosha
mournfully
,
``
and
you
say
it

*NL*
``
No

He
said
*NL*
that
about
me

And
do
you
know
you
are
longing
for
their
praise
--
``
he
is
a

criminal

a

confessed

Ivan
cried
suddenly

with
flashing

``

*NL*
``

Ivan
went
on

unheeding

still
you
had
a

praise

*NL*
``
Brother

interposed
Alyosha
--
his
heart
sank
with
terror
,
but
he
still
*NL*
seemed
to
hope
to
bring
Ivan
to
reason
--
``
how
could
he
have
told
you
of
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
death
before
I
came

when
no

of
it

there
was
no

time
for
any
one
to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
me
,

said
Ivan
firmly
,
refusing
to
admit
a
doubt
.
``
It
was
all
he
*NL*
did
talk
about
,
if
you
come
to
that
.
`
And
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
*NL*
believed
in
virtue

'
he
said
.
`
No
matter
if
they
disbelieve
you
,
you
are
*NL*
going
for
the
sake
of
principle
.
But
you
are
a
little
pig
like
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
and
what
do
you
want
with
virtue
?
Why
do
you
want
to
go
*NL*
meddling
if
your
sacrifice
is
of
no
use
to
any
one
?
Because
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
yourself
why
you
go
!
Oh
,
you
'd
give
a
great
deal
to
know
yourself
why
you
*NL*
go
!
And
can
you
have
made
up
your
mind
?
You
've
not
made
up
your
mind

*NL*
You
'll
sit
all
night
deliberating
whether
to
go
or
not

But
you
will
go
;
*NL*
you
know
you
'll
go
.
You
know
that
whichever
way
you
decide
,
the
decision
*NL*
does
not
depend
on
you
.
You
'll
go
because
you
wo
n't
dare
not
to
go
.
Why
*NL*
wo
n't
you
dare
?
You
must
guess
that
for
yourself
.
That
's
a
riddle
for
*NL*
you
!
'
He
got
up
and
went
away
.
You
came
and
he
went
.
He
called
me
a
*NL*
coward
,
Alyosha
!
_
Le
mot
de
l'enigme
_
is
that
I
am
a
coward
.
`
It
is
not
*NL*
for
such
eagles
to
soar
above
the
earth
.
'
It
was
he
added
that
--
he
!
And
*NL*
Smerdyakov
said
the
same
.
He
must
be
killed
!
Katya
despises
me
.
I
've
seen
*NL*
that
for
a
month
past
.
Even
Lise
will
begin
to
despise
me
!
`
You
are
going
*NL*
in
order
to
be
praised
.
'
That
's
a
brutal
lie
!
And
you
despise
me
too
,
*NL*
Alyosha
.
Now
I
am
going
to
hate
you
again
!
And
I
hate
the
monster
,
too
!
I
*NL*
hate
the
monster
!
I
do
n't
want
to
save
the
monster
.
Let
him
rot
in
*NL*
Siberia
!
He
's
begun
singing
a
hymn
!
Oh
,
to-morrow
I
'll
go
,
stand
before
*NL*
them
,
and
spit
in
their
faces
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
in
a
frenzy
,
flung
off
the
towel
,
and
fell
to
pacing
up
and
*NL*
down
the
room
again
.
Alyosha
recalled
what
he
had
just
said
.
``
I
seem
to
be
*NL*
sleeping
awake
...
I
walk
,
I
speak
,
I
see
,
but
I
am
asleep
.
''
It
seemed
to
*NL*
be
just
like
that
now
.
Alyosha
did
not
leave
him
.
The
thought
passed
*NL*
through
his
mind
to
run
for
a
doctor
,
but
he
was
afraid
to
leave
his
*NL*
brother
alone
:
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
could
leave
him
.
By
degrees
*NL*
Ivan
lost
consciousness
completely
at
last
.
He
still
went
on
talking
,
*NL*
talking
incessantly
,
but
quite
incoherently
,
and
even
articulated
his
*NL*
words
with
difficulty
.
Suddenly
he
staggered
violently
;
but
Alyosha
was
in
*NL*
time
to
support
him
.
Ivan
let
him
lead
him
to
his
bed
.
Alyosha
undressed
*NL*
him
somehow
and
put
him
to
bed
.
He
sat
watching
over
him
for
another
two
*NL*
hours
.
The
sick
man
slept
soundly
,
without
stirring
,
breathing
softly
and
*NL*
evenly
.
Alyosha
took
a
pillow
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
without
*NL*
undressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
fell
asleep
he
prayed
for
Mitya
and
Ivan
.
He
began
to
understand
*NL*
Ivan
's
illness
.
``
The
anguish
of
a
proud
determination
.
An
earnest
*NL*
conscience
!
''
God
,
in
Whom
he
disbelieved
,
and
His
truth
were
gaining
*NL*
mastery
over
his
heart
,
which
still
refused
to
submit
.
``
Yes
,
''
the
thought
*NL*
floated
through
Alyosha
's
head
as
it
lay
on
the
pillow
,
``
yes
,
if
*NL*
Smerdyakov
is
dead
,
no
one
will
believe
Ivan
's
evidence
;
but
he
will
go
*NL*
and
give
it
.
''
Alyosha
smiled
softly
.
``
God
will
conquer
!
''
he
thought
.
``
He
*NL*
will
either
rise
up
in
the
light
of
truth
,
or
...
he
'll
perish
in
hate
,
*NL*
revenging
on
himself
and
on
every
one
his
having
served
the
cause
he
does
*NL*
not
believe
in
,

Alyosha
added
bitterly
,
and
again
he
prayed
for
Ivan

A

Error

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I
.
The
Fatal
Day
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
day
following
the
events
I
have
*NL*
described
,
the
trial
of
Dmitri
Karamazov
began
in
our
district
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hasten
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
I
am
far
from
esteeming
myself
capable
*NL*
of
reporting
all
that
took
place
at
the
trial
in
full
detail
,
or
even
in
*NL*
the
actual
order
of
events
.
I
imagine
that
to
mention
everything
with
full
*NL*
explanation
would
fill
a
volume
,
even
a
very
large
one
.
And
so
I
trust
I
*NL*
may
not
be
reproached
,
for
confining
myself
to
what
struck
me
.
I
may
have
*NL*
selected
as
of
most
interest
what
was
of
secondary
importance
,
and
may
*NL*
have
omitted
the
most
prominent
and
essential
details
.
But
I
see
I
shall
*NL*
do
better
not
to
apologize
.
I
will
do
my
best
and
the
reader
will
see
for
*NL*
himself
that
I
have
done
all
I
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
to
begin
with
,
before
entering
the
court
,
I
will
mention
what
*NL*
surprised
me
most
on
that
day
.
Indeed
,
as
it
appeared
later
,
every
one
was
*NL*
surprised
at
it
,
too
.
We
all
knew
that
the
affair
had
aroused
great
*NL*
interest
,
that
every
one
was
burning
with
impatience
for
the
trial
to
*NL*
begin
,
that
it
had
been
a
subject
of
talk
,
conjecture
,
exclamation
and
*NL*
surmise
for
the
last
two
months
in
local
society
.
Every
one
knew
,
too
,
*NL*
that
the
case
had
become
known
throughout
Russia
,
but
yet
we
had
not
*NL*
imagined
that
it
had
aroused
such
burning
,
such
intense
,
interest
in
every
*NL*
one
,
not
only
among
ourselves
,
but
all
over
Russia
.
This
became
evident
at
*NL*
the
trial
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Visitors
had
arrived
not
only
from
the
chief
town
of
our
province
,
but
*NL*
from
several
other
Russian
towns
,
as
well
as
from
Moscow
and
Petersburg
.
*NL*
Among
them
were
lawyers
,
ladies
,
and
even
several
distinguished
*NL*
personages
.
Every
ticket
of
admission
had
been
snatched
up
.
A
special
*NL*
place
behind
the
table
at
which
the
three
judges
sat
was
set
apart
for
the
*NL*
most
distinguished
and
important
of
the
men
visitors
;
a
row
of
arm-chairs
*NL*
had
been
placed
there
--
something
exceptional
,
which
had
never
been
allowed
*NL*
before
.
A
large
proportion
--
not
less
than
half
of
the
public
--
were
ladies
.
*NL*
There
was
such
a
large
number
of
lawyers
from
all
parts
that
they
did
not
*NL*
know
where
to
seat
them
,
for
every
ticket
had
long
since
been
eagerly
*NL*
sought
for
and
distributed
.
I
saw
at
the
end
of
the
room
,
behind
the
*NL*
platform
,
a
special
partition
hurriedly
put
up
,
behind
which
all
these
*NL*
lawyers
were
admitted
,
and
they
thought
themselves
lucky
to
have
standing
*NL*
room
there
,
for
all
chairs
had
been
removed
for
the
sake
of
space
,
and
the
*NL*
crowd
behind
the
partition
stood
throughout
the
case
closely
packed
,
*NL*
shoulder
to
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
ladies
,
especially
those
who
came
from
a
distance
,
made
their
*NL*
appearance
in
the
gallery
very
smartly
dressed
,
but
the
majority
of
the
*NL*
ladies
were
oblivious
even
of
dress
.
Their
faces
betrayed
hysterical
,
*NL*
intense
,
almost
morbid
,
curiosity
.
A
peculiar
fact
--
established
afterwards
*NL*
by
many
observations
--
was
that
almost
all
the
ladies
,
or
,
at
least
the
vast
*NL*
majority
of
them
,
were
on
Mitya
's
side
and
in
favor
of
his
being
*NL*
acquitted
.
This
was
perhaps
chiefly
owing
to
his
reputation
as
a
conqueror
*NL*
of
female
hearts
.
It
was
known
that
two
women
rivals
were
to
appear
in
the
*NL*
case
.
One
of
them
--
Katerina
Ivanovna
--
was
an
object
of
general
interest
.
All
*NL*
sorts
of
extraordinary
tales
were
told
about
her
,
amazing
anecdotes
of
her
*NL*
passion
for
Mitya
,
in
spite
of
his
crime
.
Her
pride
and
``
aristocratic
*NL*
connections
''
were
particularly
insisted
upon
-LRB-
she
had
called
upon
scarcely
*NL*
any
one
in
the
town
-RRB-
.
People
said
she
intended
to
petition
the
Government
*NL*
for
leave
to
accompany
the
criminal
to
Siberia
and
to
be
married
to
him
*NL*
somewhere
in
the
mines
.
The
appearance
of
Grushenka
in
court
was
awaited
*NL*
with
no
less
impatience
.
The
public
was
looking
forward
with
anxious
*NL*
curiosity
to
the
meeting
of
the
two
rivals
--
the
proud
aristocratic
girl
and
*NL*
``
the
hetaira
.
''
But
Grushenka
was
a
more
familiar
figure
to
the
ladies
of
*NL*
the
district
than
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
They
had
already
seen
``
the
woman
who
*NL*
had
ruined
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
his
unhappy
son
,
''
and
all
,
almost
without
*NL*
exception
,
wondered
how
father
and
son
could
be
so
in
love
with
``
such
a
*NL*
very
common
,
ordinary
Russian
girl
,
who
was
not
even
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
brief
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
.
I
know
for
a
fact
that
there
*NL*
were
several
serious
family
quarrels
on
Mitya
's
account
in
our
town
.
Many
*NL*
ladies
quarreled
violently
with
their
husbands
over
differences
of
opinion
*NL*
about
the
dreadful
case
,
and
it
was
only
natural
that
the
husbands
of
*NL*
these
ladies
,
far
from
being
favorably
disposed
to
the
prisoner
,
should
*NL*
enter
the
court
bitterly
prejudiced
against
him
.
In
fact
,
one
may
say
*NL*
pretty
certainly
that
the
masculine
,
as
distinguished
from
the
feminine
,
*NL*
part
of
the
audience
were
biased
against
the
prisoner
.
There
were
numbers
*NL*
of
severe
,
frowning
,
even
vindictive
faces
.
Mitya
,
indeed
,
had
managed
to
*NL*
offend
many
people
during
his
stay
in
the
town
.
Some
of
the
visitors
were
,
*NL*
of
course
,
in
excellent
spirits
and
quite
unconcerned
as
to
the
fate
of
*NL*
Mitya
personally
.
But
all
were
interested
in
the
trial
,
and
the
majority
*NL*
of
the
men
were
certainly
hoping
for
the
conviction
of
the
criminal
,
*NL*
except
perhaps
the
lawyers
,
who
were
more
interested
in
the
legal
than
in
*NL*
the
moral
aspect
of
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
excited
at
the
presence
of
the
celebrated
lawyer
,
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
.
His
talent
was
well
known
,
and
this
was
not
the
first
time
*NL*
he
had
defended
notorious
criminal
cases
in
the
provinces
.
And
if
he
*NL*
defended
them
,
such
cases
became
celebrated
and
long
remembered
all
over
*NL*
Russia
.
There
were
stories
,
too
,
about
our
prosecutor
and
about
the
*NL*
President
of
the
Court
.
It
was
said
that
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
was
in
a
*NL*
tremor
at
meeting
Fetyukovitch
,
and
that
they
had
been
enemies
from
the
*NL*
beginning
of
their
careers
in
Petersburg
,
that
though
our
sensitive
*NL*
prosecutor
,
who
always
considered
that
he
had
been
aggrieved
by
some
one
*NL*
in
Petersburg
because
his
talents
had
not
been
properly
appreciated
,
was
*NL*
keenly
excited
over
the
Karamazov
case
,
and
was
even
dreaming
of
*NL*
rebuilding
his
flagging
fortunes
by
means
of
it
,
Fetyukovitch
,
they
said
,
*NL*
was
his
one
anxiety
.
But
these
rumors
were
not
quite
just
.
Our
prosecutor
*NL*
was
not
one
of
those
men
who
lose
heart
in
face
of
danger
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
his
self-confidence
increased
with
the
increase
of
danger
.
It
*NL*
must
be
noted
that
our
prosecutor
was
in
general
too
hasty
and
morbidly
*NL*
impressionable
.
He
would
put
his
whole
soul
into
some
case
and
work
at
it
*NL*
as
though
his
whole
fate
and
his
whole
fortune
depended
on
its
result
.
*NL*
This
was
the
subject
of
some
ridicule
in
the
legal
world
,
for
just
by
this
*NL*
characteristic
our
prosecutor
had
gained
a
wider
notoriety
than
could
have
*NL*
been
expected
from
his
modest
position
.
People
laughed
particularly
at
his
*NL*
passion
for
psychology
.
In
my
opinion
,
they
were
wrong
,
and
our
prosecutor
*NL*
was
,
I
believe
,
a
character
of
greater
depth
than
was
generally
supposed
.
*NL*
But
with
his
delicate
health
he
had
failed
to
make
his
mark
at
the
outset
*NL*
of
his
career
and
had
never
made
up
for
it
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
President
of
our
Court
,
I
can
only
say
that
he
was
a
humane
and
*NL*
cultured
man
,
who
had
a
practical
knowledge
of
his
work
and
progressive
*NL*
views
.
He
was
rather
ambitious
,
but
did
not
concern
himself
greatly
about
*NL*
his
future
career
.
The
great
aim
of
his
life
was
to
be
a
man
of
advanced
*NL*
ideas
.
He
was
,
too
,
a
man
of
connections
and
property
.
He
felt
,
as
we
*NL*
learnt
afterwards
,
rather
strongly
about
the
Karamazov
case
,
but
from
a
*NL*
social
,
not
from
a
personal
standpoint
.
He
was
interested
in
it
as
a
*NL*
social
phenomenon
,
in
its
classification
and
its
character
as
a
product
of
*NL*
our
social
conditions
,
as
typical
of
the
national
character
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
His
attitude
to
the
personal
aspect
of
the
case
,
to
its
tragic
*NL*
significance
and
the
persons
involved
in
it
,
including
the
prisoner
,
was
*NL*
rather
indifferent
and
abstract
,
as
was
perhaps
fitting
,
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
court
was
packed
and
overflowing
long
before
the
judges
made
their
*NL*
appearance
.
Our
court
is
the
best
hall
in
the
town
--
spacious
,
lofty
,
and
*NL*
good
for
sound
.
On
the
right
of
the
judges
,
who
were
on
a
raised
platform
,
*NL*
a
table
and
two
rows
of
chairs
had
been
put
ready
for
the
jury
.
On
the
*NL*
left
was
the
place
for
the
prisoner
and
the
counsel
for
the
defense
.
In
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
court
,
near
the
judges
,
was
a
table
with
the
``
material
*NL*
proofs
.
''
On
it
lay
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
white
silk
dressing-gown
,
stained
*NL*
with
blood
;
the
fatal
brass
pestle
with
which
the
supposed
murder
had
been
*NL*
committed
;
Mitya
's
shirt
,
with
a
blood-stained
sleeve
;
his
coat
,
stained
*NL*
with
blood
in
patches
over
the
pocket
in
which
he
had
put
his
*NL*
handkerchief
;
the
handkerchief
itself
,
stiff
with
blood
and
by
now
quite
*NL*
yellow
;
the
pistol
loaded
by
Mitya
at
Perhotin
's
with
a
view
to
suicide
,
*NL*
and
taken
from
him
on
the
sly
at
Mokroe
by
Trifon
Borissovitch
;
the
*NL*
envelope
in
which
the
three
thousand
roubles
had
been
put
ready
for
*NL*
Grushenka
,
the
narrow
pink
ribbon
with
which
it
had
been
tied
,
and
many
*NL*
other
articles
I
do
n't
remember
.
In
the
body
of
the
hall
,
at
some
*NL*
distance
,
came
the
seats
for
the
public
.
But
in
front
of
the
balustrade
a
*NL*
few
chairs
had
been
placed
for
witnesses
who
remained
in
the
court
after
*NL*
giving
their
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
the
three
judges
arrived
--
the
President
,
one
honorary
*NL*
justice
of
the
peace
,
and
one
other
.
The
prosecutor
,
of
course
,
entered
*NL*
immediately
after
.
The
President
was
a
short
,
stout
,
thick-set
man
of
*NL*
fifty
,
with
a
dyspeptic
complexion
,
dark
hair
turning
gray
and
cut
short
,
*NL*
and
a
red
ribbon
,
of
what
Order
I
do
n't
remember
.
The
prosecutor
struck
me
*NL*
and
the
others
,
too
,
as
looking
particularly
pale
,
almost
green
.
His
face
*NL*
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
thinner
,
perhaps
in
a
single
night
,
for
I
*NL*
had
seen
him
looking
as
usual
only
two
days
before
.
The
President
began
*NL*
with
asking
the
court
whether
all
the
jury
were
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
see
I
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
,
partly
because
some
things
I
did
not
*NL*
hear
,
others
I
did
not
notice
,
and
others
I
have
forgotten
,
but
most
of
*NL*
all
because
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
I
have
literally
no
time
or
space
to
*NL*
mention
everything
that
was
said
and
done
.
I
only
know
that
neither
side
*NL*
objected
to
very
many
of
the
jurymen
.
I
remember
the
twelve
jurymen
--
four
*NL*
were
petty
officials
of
the
town
,
two
were
merchants
,
and
six
peasants
and
*NL*
artisans
of
the
town
.
I
remember
,
long
before
the
trial
,
questions
were
*NL*
continually
asked
with
some
surprise
,
especially
by
ladies
:
``
Can
such
a
*NL*
delicate
,
complex
and
psychological
case
be
submitted
for
decision
to
*NL*
petty
officials
and
even
peasants
?
''
and
``
What
can
an
official
,
still
more
*NL*
a
peasant
,
understand
in
such
an
affair
?
''
All
the
four
officials
in
the
*NL*
jury
were
,
in
fact
,
men
of
no
consequence
and
of
low
rank
.
Except
one
who
*NL*
was
rather
younger
,
they
were
gray-headed
men
,
little
known
in
society
,
*NL*
who
had
vegetated
on
a
pitiful
salary
,
and
who
probably
had
elderly
,
*NL*
unpresentable
wives
and
crowds
of
children
,
perhaps
even
without
shoes
and
*NL*
stockings
.
At
most
,
they
spent
their
leisure
over
cards
and
,
of
course
,
*NL*
had
never
read
a
single
book
.
The
two
merchants
looked
respectable
,
but
*NL*
were
strangely
silent
and
stolid
.
One
of
them
was
close-shaven
,
and
was
*NL*
dressed
in
European
style
;
the
other
had
a
small
,
gray
beard
,
and
wore
a
*NL*
red
ribbon
with
some
sort
of
a
medal
upon
it
on
his
neck
.
There
is
no
need
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
artisans
and
the
peasants
.
The
artisans
of
*NL*
Skotoprigonyevsk
are
almost
peasants
,
and
even
work
on
the
land
.
Two
of
*NL*
them
also
wore
European
dress
,
and
,
perhaps
for
that
reason
,
were
dirtier
*NL*
and
more
uninviting-looking
than
the
others
.
So
that
one
might
well
*NL*
wonder
,
as
I
did
as
soon
as
I
had
looked
at
them
,
``
what
men
like
that
*NL*
could
possibly
make
of
such
a
case
?
''
Yet
their
faces
made
a
strangely
*NL*
imposing
,
almost
menacing
,
impression
;
they
were
stern
and
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
President
opened
the
case
of
the
murder
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
Karamazov
.
I
do
n't
quite
remember
how
he
described
him
.
The
court
usher
*NL*
was
told
to
bring
in
the
prisoner
,
and
Mitya
made
his
appearance
.
There
*NL*
was
a
hush
through
the
court
.
One
could
have
heard
a
fly
.
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
it
was
with
others
,
but
Mitya
made
a
most
unfavorable
impression
on
me
.
He
*NL*
looked
an
awful
dandy
in
a
brand-new
frock-coat
.
I
heard
afterwards
that
*NL*
he
had
ordered
it
in
Moscow
expressly
for
the
occasion
from
his
own
*NL*
tailor
,
who
had
his
measure
.
He
wore
immaculate
black
kid
gloves
and
*NL*
exquisite
linen
.
He
walked
in
with
his
yard-long
strides
,
looking
stiffly
*NL*
straight
in
front
of
him
,
and
sat
down
in
his
place
with
a
most
*NL*
unperturbed
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
the
counsel
for
defense
,
the
celebrated
Fetyukovitch
,
*NL*
entered
,
and
a
sort
of
subdued
hum
passed
through
the
court
.
He
was
a
*NL*
tall
,
spare
man
,
with
long
thin
legs
,
with
extremely
long
,
thin
,
pale
*NL*
fingers
,
clean-shaven
face
,
demurely
brushed
,
rather
short
hair
,
and
thin
*NL*
lips
that
were
at
times
curved
into
something
between
a
sneer
and
a
smile
.
*NL*
He
looked
about
forty
.
His
face
would
have
been
pleasant
,
if
it
had
not
*NL*
been
for
his
eyes
,
which
,
in
themselves
small
and
inexpressive
,
were
set
*NL*
remarkably
close
together
,
with
only
the
thin
,
long
nose
as
a
dividing
*NL*
line
between
them
.
In
fact
,
there
was
something
strikingly
birdlike
about
*NL*
his
face
.
He
was
in
evening
dress
and
white
tie
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
the
President
's
first
questions
to
Mitya
,
about
his
name
,
his
*NL*
calling
,
and
so
on
.
Mitya
answered
sharply
,
and
his
voice
was
so
*NL*
unexpectedly
loud
that
it
made
the
President
start
and
look
at
the
*NL*
prisoner
with
surprise
.
Then
followed
a
list
of
persons
who
were
to
take
*NL*
part
in
the
proceedings
--
that
is
,
of
the
witnesses
and
experts
.
It
was
a
*NL*
long
list
.
Four
of
the
witnesses
were
not
present
--
Miuesov
,
who
had
given
*NL*
evidence
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
,
but
was
now
in
Paris
;
Madame
Hohlakov
*NL*
and
Maximov
,
who
were
absent
through
illness
;
and
Smerdyakov
,
through
his
*NL*
sudden
death
,
of
which
an
official
statement
from
the
police
was
*NL*
presented
.
The
news
of
Smerdyakov
's
death
produced
a
sudden
stir
and
*NL*
whisper
in
the
court
.
Many
of
the
audience
,
of
course
,
had
not
heard
of
*NL*
the
sudden
suicide
.
What
struck
people
most
was
Mitya
's
sudden
outburst
As
*NL*
soon
as
the
statement
of
Smerdyakov
's
death
was
made
,
he
cried
out
aloud
*NL*
from
his
place
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
dog
and
died
like
a
dog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
how
his
counsel
rushed
to
him
,
and
how
the
President
addressed
*NL*
him
,
threatening
to
take
stern
measures
,
if
such
an
irregularity
were
*NL*
repeated
.
Mitya
nodded
and
in
a
subdued
voice
repeated
several
times
*NL*
abruptly
to
his
counsel
,
with
no
show
of
regret
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
again
,
I
wo
n't
.
It
escaped
me
.
I
wo
n't
do
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
of
course
,
this
brief
episode
did
him
no
good
with
the
jury
or
the
*NL*
public
.
His
character
was
displayed
,
and
it
spoke
for
itself
.
It
was
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
this
incident
that
the
opening
statement
was
read
.
It
was
*NL*
rather
short
,
but
circumstantial
.
It
only
stated
the
chief
reasons
why
he
*NL*
had
been
arrested
,
why
he
must
be
tried
,
and
so
on
.
Yet
it
made
a
great
*NL*
impression
on
me
.
The
clerk
read
it
loudly
and
distinctly
.
The
whole
*NL*
tragedy
was
suddenly
unfolded
before
us
,
concentrated
,
in
bold
relief
,
in
*NL*
a
fatal
and
pitiless
light
.
I
remember
how
,
immediately
after
it
had
been
*NL*
read
,
the
President
asked
Mitya
in
a
loud
impressive
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prisoner
,
do
you
plead
guilty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
plead
guilty
to
drunkenness
and
dissipation
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
again
in
a
*NL*
startling
,
almost
frenzied
,
voice
,
``
to
idleness
and
debauchery
.
I
meant
to
*NL*
become
an
honest
man
for
good
,
just
at
the
moment
when
I
was
struck
down
*NL*
by
fate
.
But
I
am
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
that
old
man
,
my
enemy
and
my
*NL*
father
.
No
,
no
,
I
am
not
guilty
of
robbing
him
!
I
could
not
be
.
Dmitri
*NL*
Karamazov
is
a
scoundrel
,
but
not
a
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
again
,
visibly
trembling
all
over
.
The
President
again
*NL*
briefly
,
but
impressively
,
admonished
him
to
answer
only
what
was
asked
,
*NL*
and
not
to
go
off
into
irrelevant
exclamations
.
Then
he
ordered
the
case
*NL*
to
proceed
.
All
the
witnesses
were
led
up
to
take
the
oath
.
Then
I
saw
*NL*
them
all
together
.
The
brothers
of
the
prisoner
were
,
however
,
allowed
to
*NL*
give
evidence
without
taking
the
oath
.
After
an
exhortation
from
the
*NL*
priest
and
the
President
,
the
witnesses
were
led
away
and
were
made
to
sit
*NL*
as
far
as
possible
apart
from
one
another
.
Then
they
began
calling
them
up
*NL*
one
by
one
.

*NL*
Chapter
II
.
Dangerous
Witnesses
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
whether
the
witnesses
for
the
defense
and
for
the
*NL*
prosecution
were
separated
into
groups
by
the
President
,
and
whether
it
*NL*
was
arranged
to
call
them
in
a
certain
order
.
But
no
doubt
it
was
so
.
I
*NL*
only
know
that
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
called
first
.
I
*NL*
repeat
I
do
n't
intend
to
describe
all
the
questions
step
by
step
.
Besides
,
*NL*
my
account
would
be
to
some
extent
superfluous
,
because
in
the
speeches
*NL*
for
the
prosecution
and
for
the
defense
the
whole
course
of
the
evidence
*NL*
was
brought
together
and
set
in
a
strong
and
significant
light
,
and
I
took
*NL*
down
parts
of
those
two
remarkable
speeches
in
full
,
and
will
quote
them
*NL*
in
due
course
,
together
with
one
extraordinary
and
quite
unexpected
*NL*
episode
,
which
occurred
before
the
final
speeches
,
and
undoubtedly
*NL*
influenced
the
sinister
and
fatal
outcome
of
the
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
only
observe
that
from
the
first
moments
of
the
trial
one
peculiar
*NL*
characteristic
of
the
case
was
conspicuous
and
observed
by
all
,
that
is
,
*NL*
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
prosecution
as
compared
with
the
*NL*
arguments
the
defense
had
to
rely
upon
.
Every
one
realized
it
from
the
*NL*
first
moment
that
the
facts
began
to
group
themselves
round
a
single
*NL*
point
,
and
the
whole
horrible
and
bloody
crime
was
gradually
revealed
.
*NL*
Every
one
,
perhaps
,
felt
from
the
first
that
the
case
was
beyond
dispute
,
*NL*
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
,
that
there
could
be
really
no
*NL*
discussion
,
and
that
the
defense
was
only
a
matter
of
form
,
and
that
the
*NL*
prisoner
was
guilty
,
obviously
and
conclusively
guilty
.
I
imagine
that
*NL*
even
the
ladies
,
who
were
so
impatiently
longing
for
the
acquittal
of
the
*NL*
interesting
prisoner
,
were
at
the
same
time
,
without
exception
,
convinced
*NL*
of
his
guilt
.
What
's
more
,
I
believe
they
would
have
been
mortified
if
his
*NL*
guilt
had
not
been
so
firmly
established
,
as
that
would
have
lessened
the
*NL*
effect
of
the
closing
scene
of
the
criminal
's
acquittal
.
That
he
would
be
*NL*
acquitted
,
all
the
ladies
,
strange
to
say
,
were
firmly
persuaded
up
to
the
*NL*
very
last
moment
.
``
He
is
guilty
,
but
he
will
be
acquitted
,
from
motives
of
*NL*
humanity
,
in
accordance
with
the
new
ideas
,
the
new
sentiments
that
had
*NL*
come
into
fashion
,
''
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
And
that
was
why
they
had
*NL*
crowded
into
the
court
so
impatiently
.
The
men
were
more
interested
in
the
*NL*
contest
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
famous
Fetyukovitch
.
All
were
*NL*
wondering
and
asking
themselves
what
could
even
a
talent
like
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
's
make
of
such
a
desperate
case
;
and
so
they
followed
his
*NL*
achievements
,
step
by
step
,
with
concentrated
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fetyukovitch
remained
an
enigma
to
all
up
to
the
very
end
,
up
to
his
*NL*
speech
.
Persons
of
experience
suspected
that
he
had
some
design
,
that
he
*NL*
was
working
towards
some
object
,
but
it
was
almost
impossible
to
guess
*NL*
what
it
was
.
His
confidence
and
self-reliance
were
unmistakable
,
however
.
*NL*
Every
one
noticed
with
pleasure
,
moreover
,
that
he
,
after
so
short
a
stay
,
*NL*
not
more
than
three
days
,
perhaps
,
among
us
,
had
so
wonderfully
succeeded
*NL*
in
mastering
the
case
and
``
had
studied
it
to
a
nicety
.
''
People
described
*NL*
with
relish
,
afterwards
,
how
cleverly
he
had
``
taken
down
''
all
the
*NL*
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
,
and
as
far
as
possible
perplexed
them
and
,
*NL*
what
's
more
,
had
aspersed
their
reputation
and
so
depreciated
the
value
of
*NL*
their
evidence
.
But
it
was
supposed
that
he
did
this
rather
by
way
of
*NL*
sport
,
so
to
speak
,
for
professional
glory
,
to
show
nothing
had
been
*NL*
omitted
of
the
accepted
methods
,
for
all
were
convinced
that
he
could
do
*NL*
no
real
good
by
such
disparagement
of
the
witnesses
,
and
probably
was
more
*NL*
aware
of
this
than
any
one
,
having
some
idea
of
his
own
in
the
background
,
*NL*
some
concealed
weapon
of
defense
,
which
he
would
suddenly
reveal
when
the
*NL*
time
came
.
But
meanwhile
,
conscious
of
his
strength
,
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
diverting
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
for
instance
,
when
Grigory
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
old
servant
,
who
had
*NL*
given
the
most
damning
piece
of
evidence
about
the
open
door
,
was
*NL*
examined
,
the
counsel
for
the
defense
positively
fastened
upon
him
when
*NL*
his
turn
came
to
question
him
.
It
must
be
noted
that
Grigory
entered
the
*NL*
hall
with
a
composed
and
almost
stately
air
,
not
the
least
disconcerted
by
*NL*
the
majesty
of
the
court
or
the
vast
audience
listening
to
him
.
He
gave
*NL*
evidence
with
as
much
confidence
as
though
he
had
been
talking
with
his
*NL*
Marfa
,
only
perhaps
more
respectfully
.
It
was
impossible
to
make
him
*NL*
contradict
himself
.
The
prosecutor
questioned
him
first
in
detail
about
*NL*
the
family
life
of
the
Karamazovs
.
The
family
picture
stood
out
in
lurid
*NL*
colors
.
It
was
plain
to
ear
and
eye
that
the
witness
was
guileless
and
*NL*
impartial
.
In
spite
of
his
profound
reverence
for
the
memory
of
his
*NL*
deceased
master
,
he
yet
bore
witness
that
he
had
been
unjust
to
Mitya
and
*NL*
``
had
n't
brought
up
his
children
as
he
should
.
He
'd
have
been
devoured
by
*NL*
lice
when
he
was
little
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
me
,
''
he
added
,
describing
*NL*
Mitya
's
early
childhood
.
``
It
was
n't
fair
either
of
the
father
to
wrong
his
*NL*
son
over
his
mother
's
property
,
which
was
by
right
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
the
prosecutor
's
question
what
grounds
he
had
for
asserting
*NL*
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
wronged
his
son
in
their
money
relations
,
*NL*
Grigory
,
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
,
had
no
proof
at
all
to
bring
*NL*
forward
,
but
he
still
persisted
that
the
arrangement
with
the
son
was
*NL*
``
unfair
,
''
and
that
he
ought
``
to
have
paid
him
several
thousand
roubles
*NL*
more
.
''
I
must
note
,
by
the
way
,
that
the
prosecutor
asked
this
question
*NL*
whether
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
really
kept
back
part
of
Mitya
's
inheritance
*NL*
with
marked
persistence
of
all
the
witnesses
who
could
be
asked
it
,
not
*NL*
excepting
Alyosha
and
Ivan
,
but
he
obtained
no
exact
information
from
any
*NL*
one
;
all
alleged
that
it
was
so
,
but
were
unable
to
bring
forward
any
*NL*
distinct
proof
.
Grigory
's
description
of
the
scene
at
the
dinner-table
,
*NL*
when
Dmitri
had
burst
in
and
beaten
his
father
,
threatening
to
come
back
*NL*
to
kill
him
,
made
a
sinister
impression
on
the
court
,
especially
as
the
*NL*
old
servant
's
composure
in
telling
it
,
his
parsimony
of
words
and
peculiar
*NL*
phraseology
,
were
as
effective
as
eloquence
.
He
observed
that
he
was
not
*NL*
angry
with
Mitya
for
having
knocked
him
down
and
struck
him
on
the
face
;
*NL*
he
had
forgiven
him
long
ago
,
he
said
.
Of
the
deceased
Smerdyakov
he
*NL*
observed
,
crossing
himself
,
that
he
was
a
lad
of
ability
,
but
stupid
and
*NL*
afflicted
,
and
,
worse
still
,
an
infidel
,
and
that
it
was
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
and
his
elder
son
who
had
taught
him
to
be
so
.
But
he
defended
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
honesty
almost
with
warmth
,
and
related
how
Smerdyakov
had
*NL*
once
found
the
master
's
money
in
the
yard
,
and
,
instead
of
concealing
it
,
*NL*
had
taken
it
to
his
master
,
who
had
rewarded
him
with
a
``
gold
piece
''
for
*NL*
it
,
and
trusted
him
implicitly
from
that
time
forward
.
He
maintained
*NL*
obstinately
that
the
door
into
the
garden
had
been
open
.
But
he
was
asked
*NL*
so
many
questions
that
I
ca
n't
recall
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
counsel
for
the
defense
began
to
cross-examine
him
,
and
the
*NL*
first
question
he
asked
was
about
the
envelope
in
which
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
was
supposed
to
have
put
three
thousand
roubles
for
``
a
certain
person
.
''
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
it
,
you
,
who
were
for
so
many
years
in
close
*NL*
attendance
on
your
master
?
''
Grigory
answered
that
he
had
not
seen
it
and
*NL*
had
never
heard
of
the
money
from
any
one
``
till
everybody
was
talking
*NL*
about
it
.
''
This
question
about
the
envelope
Fetyukovitch
put
to
every
one
*NL*
who
could
conceivably
have
known
of
it
,
as
persistently
as
the
prosecutor
*NL*
asked
his
question
about
Dmitri
's
inheritance
,
and
got
the
same
answer
*NL*
from
all
,
that
no
one
had
seen
the
envelope
,
though
many
had
heard
of
it
.
*NL*
From
the
beginning
every
one
noticed
Fetyukovitch
's
persistence
on
this
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
with
your
permission
I
'll
ask
you
a
question
,
''
Fetyukovitch
said
,
*NL*
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
.
``
Of
what
was
that
balsam
,
or
,
rather
,
*NL*
decoction
,
made
,
which
,
as
we
learn
from
the
preliminary
inquiry
,
you
used
*NL*
on
that
evening
to
rub
your
lumbago
,
in
the
hope
of
curing
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
looked
blankly
at
the
questioner
,
and
after
a
brief
silence
*NL*
muttered
,
``
There
was
saffron
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
saffron
?
Do
n't
you
remember
any
other
ingredient
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
milfoil
in
it
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pepper
perhaps
?
''
Fetyukovitch
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
was
pepper
,
too

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
faint
sound
of
laughter
in
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
in
spirit

After
rubbing
your
back
,
I
believe
,
you
drank
what

was
left
in
the
bottle
with
a
certain
pious
prayer
,
only
known
to
your
*NL*
wife

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
drink
much

Roughly
speaking

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

have
been
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
tumbler-full
,
even

Perhaps
a
tumbler
and
a
half
?

*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
did
not
answer
.
He
seemed
to
see
what
was
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
glass
and
a
half
of
neat
spirit
--
is
not
at
all
bad

do
n't
you
think

You
*NL*
might
see
the
gates
of
heaven
open
,
not
only
the
door
into
the
garden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
remained
silent
.
There
was
another
laugh
in
the
court
.
The
*NL*
President
made
a
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
for
a
fact
,
''
Fetyukovitch
persisted
,
``
whether
you
were
awake
*NL*
or
not
when
you
saw
the
open
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
on
my
legs

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
a
proof
that
you
were
awake

''
-LRB-
There
was
again
laughter
in
the
*NL*
court
.
-RRB-
``
Could
you
have
answered
at
that
moment
,
if
any

asked

what

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what

''
*NL*
*NL*
Grigory
stood
with
a
perplexed
face
,
looking
straight
at
his
tormentor
.
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
it
appeared
he
really
did
not
know
what
year
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
how
many

you
have
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
servant
,
''
Grigory
said
suddenly
,
in
a
loud
and
distinct
voice
.
``
If
*NL*
my
betters
think
fit
to
make
game
of
me
,
it
is
my
duty
to
suffer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
was
a
little
taken
aback
,
and
the
President
intervened
,
*NL*
reminding
him
that
he
must
ask
more
relevant
questions
.
Fetyukovitch
bowed
*NL*
with
dignity
and
said
that
he
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
of
the
witness
.
*NL*
The
public
and
the
jury
,
of
course
,
were
left
with
a
grain
of
doubt
in
*NL*
their
minds
as
to
the
evidence
of
a
man
who
might
,
while
undergoing
a
*NL*
certain
cure
,
have
seen
``
the
gates
of
heaven
,
''
and
who
did
not
even
know
*NL*
what
year
he
was
living
in
.
But
before
Grigory
left
the
box
another
*NL*
episode
occurred
.
The
President
,
turning
to
the
prisoner
,
asked
him
*NL*
whether
he
had
any
comment
to
make
on
the
evidence
of
the
last
witness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
about
the
door
,
all
he
has
said
is
true
,
''
cried
Mitya
,
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
.
``
For
combing
the
lice
off
me
,
I
thank
him
;
for
forgiving
my
blows
,
*NL*
I
thank
him
.
The
old
man
has
been
honest
all
his
life
and
as
faithful
to
*NL*
my
father
as
seven
hundred
poodles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prisoner
,
be
careful
in
your
language
,
''
the
President
admonished
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
a
poodle
,
''
Grigory
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
it
's
I
am
a
poodle
myself
,
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
If
it
's
an
insult
,
I
*NL*
take
it
to
myself
and
I
beg
his
pardon
.
I
was
a
beast
and
cruel
to
him
.
I
*NL*
was
cruel
to
AEsop
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
AEsop
?
''
the
President
asked
sternly
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Pierrot
...
my
father
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
again
and
again
warned
Mitya
impressively
and
very
sternly
*NL*
to
be
more
careful
in
his
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
injuring
yourself
in
the
opinion
of
your
judges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
counsel
for
the
defense
was
equally
clever
in
dealing
with
the
*NL*
evidence
of
Rakitin
.
I
may
remark
that
Rakitin
was
one
of
the
leading
*NL*
witnesses
and
one
to
whom
the
prosecutor
attached
great
significance
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
he
knew
everything
;
his
knowledge
was
amazing
,
he
had
been
*NL*
everywhere
,
seen
everything
,
talked
to
everybody
,
knew
every
detail
of
the
*NL*
biography
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
and
all
the
Karamazovs
.
Of
the
envelope
,
it
*NL*
is
true
,
he
had
only
heard
from
Mitya
himself
.
But
he
described
minutely
*NL*
Mitya
's
exploits
in
the
``
Metropolis
,
''
all
his
compromising
doings
and
*NL*
sayings
,
and
told
the
story
of
Captain
Snegiryov
's
``
wisp
of
tow
.
''
But
even
*NL*
Rakitin
could
say
nothing
positive
about
Mitya
's
inheritance
,
and
confined
*NL*
himself
to
contemptuous
generalities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
could
tell
which
of
them
was
to
blame
,
and
which
was
in
debt
to
the
*NL*
other
,
with
their
crazy
Karamazov
way
of
muddling
things
so
that
no
one
*NL*
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
?
''
He
attributed
the
tragic
crime
to
the
*NL*
habits
that
had
become
ingrained
by
ages
of
serfdom
and
the
distressed
*NL*
condition
of
Russia
,
due
to
the
lack
of
appropriate
institutions
.
He
was
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
allowed
some
latitude
of
speech
.
This
was
the
first
occasion
on
*NL*
which
Rakitin
showed
what
he
could
do
,
and
attracted
notice
.
The
*NL*
prosecutor
knew
that
the
witness
was
preparing
a
magazine
article
on
the
*NL*
case
,
and
afterwards
in
his
speech
,
as
we
shall
see
later
,
quoted
some
*NL*
ideas
from
the
article
,
showing
that
he
had
seen
it
already
.
The
picture
*NL*
drawn
by
the
witness
was
a
gloomy
and
sinister
one
,
and
greatly
*NL*
strengthened
the
case
for
the
prosecution
.
Altogether
,
Rakitin
's
discourse
*NL*
fascinated
the
public
by
its
independence
and
the
extraordinary
nobility
*NL*
of
its
ideas
.
There
were
even
two
or
three
outbreaks
of
applause
when
he
*NL*
spoke
of
serfdom
and
the
distressed
condition
of
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rakitin
,
in
his
youthful
ardor
,
made
a
slight
blunder
,
of
which
the
*NL*
counsel
for
the
defense
at
once
adroitly
took
advantage
.
Answering
certain
*NL*
questions
about
Grushenka
,
and
carried
away
by
the
loftiness
of
his
own
*NL*
sentiments
and
his
success
,
of
which
he
was
,
of
course
,
conscious
,
he
went
*NL*
so
far
as
to
speak
somewhat
contemptuously
of
Agrafena
Alexandrovna
as
*NL*
``
the
kept
mistress
of
Samsonov
.
''
He
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
take
*NL*
back
his
words
afterwards
,
for
Fetyukovitch
caught
him
out
over
it
at
*NL*
once
.
And
it
was
all
because
Rakitin
had
not
reckoned
on
the
lawyer
having
*NL*
been
able
to
become
so
intimately
acquainted
with
every
detail
in
so
short
*NL*
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
ask
,
''
began
the
counsel
for
the
defense
,
with
the
most
*NL*
affable
and
even
respectful
smile
,
``
you
are
,
of
course
,
the
same
Mr.
*NL*
Rakitin
whose
pamphlet
,
_
The
Life
of
the
Deceased
Elder
,
Father
Zossima
_
,
*NL*
published
by
the
diocesan
authorities
,
full
of
profound
and
religious
*NL*
reflections
and
preceded
by
an
excellent
and
devout
dedication
to
the
*NL*
bishop
,
I
have
just
read
with
such
pleasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
write
it
for
publication
...
it
was
published
afterwards
,
''
*NL*
muttered
Rakitin
,
for
some
reason
fearfully
disconcerted
and
almost
*NL*
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
excellent
!
A
thinker
like
you
can
,
and
indeed
ought
to
,
take
*NL*
the
widest
view
of
every
social
question
.
Your
most
instructive
pamphlet
*NL*
has
been
widely
circulated
through
the
patronage
of
the
bishop
,
and
has
*NL*
been
of
appreciable
service
...
But
this
is
the
chief
thing
I
should
like
*NL*
to
learn
from
you
.
You
stated
just
now
that
you
were
very
intimately
*NL*
acquainted
with
Madame
Svyetlov
.
''
-LRB-
It
must
be
noted
that
Grushenka
's
*NL*
surname
was
Svyetlov
.
I
heard
it
for
the
first
time
that
day
,
during
the
*NL*
case
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
answer
for
all
my
acquaintances
...
I
am
a
young
man
...
and
who
*NL*
can
be
responsible
for
every
one
he
meets
?
''
cried
Rakitin
,
flushing
all
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
I
quite
understand
,
''
cried
Fetyukovitch
,
as
though
he
,
too
,
*NL*
were
embarrassed
and
in
haste
to
excuse
himself
.
``
You
,
like
any
other
,
*NL*
might
well
be
interested
in
an
acquaintance
with
a
young
and
beautiful
*NL*
woman
who
would
readily
entertain
the
_
elite
_
of
the
youth
of
the
*NL*
neighborhood
,
but
...
I
only
wanted
to
know
...
It
has
come
to
my
*NL*
knowledge
that
Madame
Svyetlov
was
particularly
anxious
a
couple
of
months
*NL*
ago
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
younger
Karamazov
,
Alexey
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
and
promised
you
twenty-five
roubles
,
if
you
would
bring
him
*NL*
to
her
in
his
monastic
dress
.
And
that
actually
took
place
on
the
evening
*NL*
of
the
day
on
which
the
terrible
crime
,
which
is
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
present
investigation
,
was
committed
.
You
brought
Alexey
Karamazov
to
*NL*
Madame
Svyetlov
,
and
did
you
receive
the
twenty-five
roubles
from
Madame
*NL*
Svyetlov
as
a
reward
,
that
's
what
I
wanted
to
hear
from
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
joke
...
I
do
n't
see
of
what
interest
that
can
be
to
you
...
I
*NL*
took
it
for
a
joke
...
meaning
to
give
it
back
later
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
did
take
--
But
you
have
not
given
it
back
yet
...
or
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
of
no
consequence
,
''
muttered
Rakitin
,
``
I
refuse
to
answer
such
*NL*
questions
...
Of
course
I
shall
give
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
intervened
,
but
Fetyukovitch
declared
he
had
no
more
*NL*
questions
to
ask
of
the
witness
.
Mr.
Rakitin
left
the
witness-box
not
*NL*
absolutely
without
a
stain
upon
his
character
.
The
effect
left
by
the
*NL*
lofty
idealism
of
his
speech
was
somewhat
marred
,
and
Fetyukovitch
's
*NL*
expression
,
as
he
watched
him
walk
away
,
seemed
to
suggest
to
the
public
*NL*
``
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
lofty-minded
persons
who
accuse
him
.
''
I
*NL*
remember
that
this
incident
,
too
,
did
not
pass
off
without
an
outbreak
*NL*
from
Mitya
.
Enraged
by
the
tone
in
which
Rakitin
had
referred
to
*NL*
Grushenka
,
he
suddenly
shouted
``
Bernard
!
''
When
,
after
Rakitin
's
cross
-
*NL*
examination
,
the
President
asked
the
prisoner
if
he
had
anything
to
say
,
*NL*
Mitya
cried
loudly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
I
've
been
arrested
,
he
has
borrowed
money
from
me
!
He
is
a
*NL*
contemptible
Bernard
and
opportunist
,
and
he
does
n't
believe
in
God
;
he
*NL*
took
the
bishop
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
,
of
course
,
was
pulled
up
again
for
the
intemperance
of
his
*NL*
language
,
but
Rakitin
was
done
for
.
Captain
Snegiryov
's
evidence
was
a
*NL*
failure
,
too
,
but
from
quite
a
different
reason
.
He
appeared
in
ragged
and
*NL*
dirty
clothes
,
muddy
boots
,
and
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
and
expert
*NL*
observation
of
the
police
officers
,
he
turned
out
to
be
hopelessly
drunk
.
*NL*
On
being
asked
about
Mitya
's
attack
upon
him
,
he
refused
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
him
.
Ilusha
told
me
not
to
.
God
will
make
it
up
to
me
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
not
to
tell
?
Of
whom
are
you
talking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
,
my
little
son
.
`
Father
,
father
,
how
he
insulted
you
!
'
He
said
*NL*
that
at
the
stone
.
Now
he
is
dying
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
suddenly
began
sobbing
,
and
plumped
down
on
his
knees
before
*NL*
the
President
.
He
was
hurriedly
led
away
amidst
the
laughter
of
the
*NL*
public
.
The
effect
prepared
by
the
prosecutor
did
not
come
off
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
went
on
making
the
most
of
every
opportunity
,
and
amazed
*NL*
people
more
and
more
by
his
minute
knowledge
of
the
case
.
Thus
,
for
*NL*
example
,
Trifon
Borissovitch
made
a
great
impression
,
of
course
,
very
*NL*
prejudicial
to
Mitya
.
He
calculated
almost
on
his
fingers
that
on
his
*NL*
first
visit
to
Mokroe
,
Mitya
must
have
spent
three
thousand
roubles
,
``
or
*NL*
very
little
less
.
Just
think
what
he
squandered
on
those
gypsy
girls
*NL*
alone
!
And
as
for
our
lousy
peasants
,
it
was
n't
a
case
of
flinging
half
a
*NL*
rouble
in
the
street
,
he
made
them
presents
of
twenty-five
roubles
each
,
*NL*
at
least
,
he
did
n't
give
them
less
.
And
what
a
lot
of
money
was
simply
*NL*
stolen
from
him
!
And
if
any
one
did
steal
,
he
did
not
leave
a
receipt
.
How
*NL*
could
one
catch
the
thief
when
he
was
flinging
his
money
away
all
the
*NL*
time
?
Our
peasants
are
robbers
,
you
know
;
they
have
no
care
for
their
*NL*
souls
.
And
the
way
he
went
on
with
the
girls
,
our
village
girls
!
They
're
*NL*
completely
set
up
since
then
,
I
tell
you
,
they
used
to
be
poor
.
''
He
*NL*
recalled
,
in
fact
,
every
item
of
expense
and
added
it
all
up
.
So
the
*NL*
theory
that
only
fifteen
hundred
had
been
spent
and
the
rest
had
been
put
*NL*
aside
in
a
little
bag
seemed
inconceivable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
three
thousand
as
clear
as
a
penny
in
his
hands
,
I
saw
it
with
my
*NL*
own
eyes
;
I
should
think
I
ought
to
know
how
to
reckon
money
,
''
cried
*NL*
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
doing
his
best
to
satisfy
``
his
betters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fetyukovitch
had
to
cross-examine
him
,
he
scarcely
tried
to
refute
*NL*
his
evidence
,
but
began
asking
him
about
an
incident
at
the
first
carousal
*NL*
at
Mokroe
,
a
month
before
the
arrest
,
when
Timofey
and
another
peasant
*NL*
called
Akim
had
picked
up
on
the
floor
in
the
passage
a
hundred
roubles
*NL*
dropped
by
Mitya
when
he
was
drunk
,
and
had
given
them
to
Trifon
*NL*
Borissovitch
and
received
a
rouble
each
from
him
for
doing
so
.
``
Well
,
''
*NL*
asked
the
lawyer
,
``
did
you
give
that
hundred
roubles
back
to
Mr.
*NL*
Karamazov
?
''
Trifon
Borissovitch
shuffled
in
vain
...
He
was
obliged
,
after
*NL*
the
peasants
had
been
examined
,
to
admit
the
finding
of
the
hundred
*NL*
roubles
,
only
adding
that
he
had
religiously
returned
it
all
to
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
``
in
perfect
honesty
,
and
it
's
only
because
his
honor
was
in
*NL*
liquor
at
the
time
,
he
would
n't
remember
it
.
''
But
,
as
he
had
denied
the
*NL*
incident
of
the
hundred
roubles
till
the
peasants
had
been
called
to
prove
*NL*
it
,
his
evidence
as
to
returning
the
money
to
Mitya
was
naturally
regarded
*NL*
with
great
suspicion
.
So
one
of
the
most
dangerous
witnesses
brought
*NL*
forward
by
the
prosecution
was
again
discredited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
thing
happened
with
the
Poles
.
They
took
up
an
attitude
of
pride
*NL*
and
independence
;
they
vociferated
loudly
that
they
had
both
been
in
the
*NL*
service
of
the
Crown
,
and
that
``
Pan
Mitya
''
had
offered
them
three
thousand
*NL*
``
to
buy
their
honor
,
''
and
that
they
had
seen
a
large
sum
of
money
in
his
*NL*
hands
.
Pan
Mussyalovitch
introduced
a
terrible
number
of
Polish
words
into
*NL*
his
sentences
,
and
seeing
that
this
only
increased
his
consequence
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
President
and
the
prosecutor
,
grew
more
and
more
pompous
,
and
*NL*
ended
by
talking
in
Polish
altogether
.
But
Fetyukovitch
caught
them
,
too
,
*NL*
in
his
snares
.
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
recalled
,
was
forced
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
evasions
,
to
admit
that
Pan
Vrublevsky
had
substituted
another
pack
of
*NL*
cards
for
the
one
he
had
provided
,
and
that
Pan
Mussyalovitch
had
cheated
*NL*
during
the
game
.
Kalganov
confirmed
this
,
and
both
the
Poles
left
the
*NL*
witness-box
with
damaged
reputations
,
amidst
laughter
from
the
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
with
almost
all
the
most
dangerous
*NL*
witnesses
.
Fetyukovitch
succeeded
in
casting
a
slur
on
all
of
them
,
and
*NL*
dismissing
them
with
a
certain
derision
.
The
lawyers
and
experts
were
lost
*NL*
in
admiration
,
and
were
only
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
good
purpose
*NL*
could
be
served
by
it
,
for
all
,
I
repeat
,
felt
that
the
case
for
the
*NL*
prosecution
could
not
be
refuted
,
but
was
growing
more
and
more
tragically
*NL*
overwhelming
.
But
from
the
confidence
of
the
``
great
magician
''
they
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
serene
,
and
they
waited
,
feeling
that
``
such
a
man
''
had
not
*NL*
come
from
Petersburg
for
nothing
,
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
return
*NL*
unsuccessful
.

The
Medical
Experts
And
A
Pound
Of
Nuts
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
evidence
of
the
medical
experts
,
too
,
was
of
little
use
to
the
*NL*
prisoner
.
And
it
appeared
later
that
Fetyukovitch
had
not
reckoned
much
*NL*
upon
it
.
The
medical
line
of
defense
had
only
been
taken
up
through
the
*NL*
insistence
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
who
had
sent
for
a
celebrated
doctor
from
*NL*
Moscow
on
purpose
.
The
case
for
the
defense
could
,
of
course
,
lose
nothing
*NL*
by
it
and
might
,
with
luck
,
gain
something
from
it
.
There
was
,
however
,
an
*NL*
element
of
comedy
about
it
,
through
the
difference
of
opinion
of
the
*NL*
doctors
.
The
medical
experts
were
the
famous
doctor
from
Moscow
,
our
*NL*
doctor
,
Herzenstube
,
and
the
young
doctor
,
Varvinsky
.
The
two
latter
*NL*
appeared
also
as
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
be
called
in
the
capacity
of
expert
was
Doctor
Herzenstube
.
*NL*
He
was
a
gray
and
bald
old
man
of
seventy
,
of
middle
height
and
sturdy
*NL*
build
.
He
was
much
esteemed
and
respected
by
every
one
in
the
town
.
He
was
*NL*
a
conscientious
doctor
and
an
excellent
and
pious
man
,
a
Hernguter
or
*NL*
Moravian
brother
,
I
am
not
quite
sure
which
.
He
had
been
living
amongst
us
*NL*
for
many
years
and
behaved
with
wonderful
dignity
.
He
was
a
kind-hearted
*NL*
and
humane
man
.
He
treated
the
sick
poor
and
peasants
for
nothing
,
visited
*NL*
them
in
their
slums
and
huts
,
and
left
money
for
medicine
,
but
he
was
as
*NL*
obstinate
as
a
mule
.
If
once
he
had
taken
an
idea
into
his
head
,
there
was
*NL*
no
shaking
it
.
Almost
every
one
in
the
town
was
aware
,
by
the
way
,
that
*NL*
the
famous
doctor
had
,
within
the
first
two
or
three
days
of
his
presence
*NL*
among
us
,
uttered
some
extremely
offensive
allusions
to
Doctor
*NL*
Herzenstube
's
qualifications
.
Though
the
Moscow
doctor
asked
twenty-five
*NL*
roubles
for
a
visit
,
several
people
in
the
town
were
glad
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
his
arrival
,
and
rushed
to
consult
him
regardless
of
expense
.
*NL*
All
these
had
,
of
course
,
been
previously
patients
of
Doctor
Herzenstube
,
*NL*
and
the
celebrated
doctor
had
criticized
his
treatment
with
extreme
*NL*
harshness
.
Finally
,
he
had
asked
the
patients
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
has
been
cramming
you
with
nostrums
?
Herzenstube
?
He
,
he
!
''
*NL*
Doctor
Herzenstube
,
of
course
,
heard
all
this
,
and
now
all
the
three
*NL*
doctors
made
their
appearance
,
one
after
another
,
to
be
examined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Herzenstube
roundly
declared
that
the
abnormality
of
the
prisoner
's
*NL*
mental
faculties
was
self-evident
.
Then
giving
his
grounds
for
this
*NL*
opinion
,
which
I
omit
here
,
he
added
that
the
abnormality
was
not
only
*NL*
evident
in
many
of
the
prisoner
's
actions
in
the
past
,
but
was
apparent
*NL*
even
now
at
this
very
moment
.
When
he
was
asked
to
explain
how
it
was
*NL*
apparent
now
at
this
moment
,
the
old
doctor
,
with
simple-hearted
*NL*
directness
,
pointed
out
that
the
prisoner
on
entering
the
court
had
``
an
*NL*
extraordinary
air
,
remarkable
in
the
circumstances
''
;
that
he
had
``
marched
*NL*
in
like
a
soldier
,
looking
straight
before
him
,
though
it
would
have
been
*NL*
more
natural
for
him
to
look
to
the
left
where
,
among
the
public
,
the
*NL*
ladies
were
sitting
,
seeing
that
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
*NL*
and
must
be
thinking
much
of
what
the
ladies
are
saying
of
him
now
,
''
the
*NL*
old
man
concluded
in
his
peculiar
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
add
that
he
spoke
Russian
readily
,
but
every
phrase
was
formed
in
*NL*
German
style
,
which
did
not
,
however
,
trouble
him
,
for
it
had
always
been
*NL*
a
weakness
of
his
to
believe
that
he
spoke
Russian
perfectly
,
better
*NL*
indeed
than
Russians
.
And
he
was
very
fond
of
using
Russian
proverbs
,
*NL*
always
declaring
that
the
Russian
proverbs
were
the
best
and
most
*NL*
expressive
sayings
in
the
whole
world
.
I
may
remark
,
too
,
that
in
*NL*
conversation
,
through
absent-mindedness
he
often
forgot
the
most
ordinary
*NL*
words
,
which
sometimes
went
out
of
his
head
,
though
he
knew
them
*NL*
perfectly
.
The
same
thing
happened
,
though
,
when
he
spoke
German
,
and
at
*NL*
such
times
he
always
waved
his
hand
before
his
face
as
though
trying
to
*NL*
catch
the
lost
word
,
and
no
one
could
induce
him
to
go
on
speaking
till
he
*NL*
had
found
the
missing
word
.
His
remark
that
the
prisoner
ought
to
have
*NL*
looked
at
the
ladies
on
entering
roused
a
whisper
of
amusement
in
the
*NL*
audience
.
All
our
ladies
were
very
fond
of
our
old
doctor
;
they
knew
,
too
,
*NL*
that
having
been
all
his
life
a
bachelor
and
a
religious
man
of
exemplary
*NL*
conduct
,
he
looked
upon
women
as
lofty
creatures
.
And
so
his
unexpected
*NL*
observation
struck
every
one
as
very
queer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Moscow
doctor
,
being
questioned
in
his
turn
,
definitely
and
*NL*
emphatically
repeated
that
he
considered
the
prisoner
's
mental
condition
*NL*
abnormal
in
the
highest
degree
.
He
talked
at
length
and
with
erudition
of
*NL*
``
aberration
''
and
``
mania
,
''
and
argued
that
,
from
all
the
facts
collected
,
*NL*
the
prisoner
had
undoubtedly
been
in
a
condition
of
aberration
for
several
*NL*
days
before
his
arrest
,
and
,
if
the
crime
had
been
committed
by
him
,
it
*NL*
must
,
even
if
he
were
conscious
of
it
,
have
been
almost
involuntary
,
as
he
*NL*
had
not
the
power
to
control
the
morbid
impulse
that
possessed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
apart
from
temporary
aberration
,
the
doctor
diagnosed
mania
,
which
*NL*
premised
,
in
his
words
,
to
lead
to
complete
insanity
in
the
future
.
-LRB-
It
*NL*
must
be
noted
that
I
report
this
in
my
own
words
,
the
doctor
made
use
of
*NL*
very
learned
and
professional
language
.
-RRB-
``
All
his
actions
are
in
*NL*
contravention
of
common
sense
and
logic
,
''
he
continued
.
``
Not
to
refer
to
*NL*
what
I
have
not
seen
,
that
is
,
the
crime
itself
and
the
whole
catastrophe
,
*NL*
the
day
before
yesterday
,
while
he
was
talking
to
me
,
he
had
an
*NL*
unaccountably
fixed
look
in
his
eye
.
He
laughed
unexpectedly
when
there
*NL*
was
nothing
to
laugh
at
.
He
showed
continual
and
inexplicable
*NL*
irritability
,
using
strange
words
,
`
Bernard
!
'
`
Ethics
!
'
and
others
equally
*NL*
inappropriate
.
''
But
the
doctor
detected
mania
,
above
all
,
in
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
prisoner
could
not
even
speak
of
the
three
thousand
roubles
,
of
which
*NL*
he
considered
himself
to
have
been
cheated
,
without
extraordinary
*NL*
irritation
,
though
he
could
speak
comparatively
lightly
of
other
*NL*
misfortunes
and
grievances
.
According
to
all
accounts
,
he
had
even
in
the
*NL*
past
,
whenever
the
subject
of
the
three
thousand
roubles
was
touched
on
,
*NL*
flown
into
a
perfect
frenzy
,
and
yet
he
was
reported
to
be
a
disinterested
*NL*
and
not
grasping
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
opinion
of
my
learned
colleague
,
''
the
Moscow
doctor
added
*NL*
ironically
in
conclusion
,
``
that
the
prisoner
would
,
on
entering
the
court
,
*NL*
have
naturally
looked
at
the
ladies
and
not
straight
before
him
,
I
will
*NL*
only
say
that
,
apart
from
the
playfulness
of
this
theory
,
it
is
radically
*NL*
unsound
.
For
though
I
fully
agree
that
the
prisoner
,
on
entering
the
court
*NL*
where
his
fate
will
be
decided
,
would
not
naturally
look
straight
before
*NL*
him
in
that
fixed
way
,
and
that
that
may
really
be
a
sign
of
his
abnormal
*NL*
mental
condition
,
at
the
same
time
I
maintain
that
he
would
naturally
not
*NL*
look
to
the
left
at
the
ladies
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
the
right
to
find
*NL*
his
legal
adviser
,
on
whose
help
all
his
hopes
rest
and
on
whose
defense
*NL*
all
his
future
depends
.
''
The
doctor
expressed
his
opinion
positively
and
*NL*
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
unexpected
pronouncement
of
Doctor
Varvinsky
gave
the
last
touch
*NL*
of
comedy
to
the
difference
of
opinion
between
the
experts
.
In
his
opinion
*NL*
the
prisoner
was
now
,
and
had
been
all
along
,
in
a
perfectly
normal
*NL*
condition
,
and
,
although
he
certainly
must
have
been
in
a
nervous
and
*NL*
exceedingly
excited
state
before
his
arrest
,
this
might
have
been
due
to
*NL*
several
perfectly
obvious
causes
,
jealousy
,
anger
,
continual
drunkenness
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
But
this
nervous
condition
would
not
involve
the
mental
*NL*
aberration
of
which
mention
had
just
been
made
.
As
to
the
question
whether
*NL*
the
prisoner
should
have
looked
to
the
left
or
to
the
right
on
entering
*NL*
the
court
,
``
in
his
modest
opinion
,
''
the
prisoner
would
naturally
look
*NL*
straight
before
him
on
entering
the
court
,
as
he
had
in
fact
done
,
as
that
*NL*
was
where
the
judges
,
on
whom
his
fate
depended
,
were
sitting
.
So
that
it
*NL*
was
just
by
looking
straight
before
him
that
he
showed
his
perfectly
*NL*
normal
state
of
mind
at
the
present
.
The
young
doctor
concluded
his
*NL*
``
modest
''
testimony
with
some
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
doctor
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
from
his
seat
,
``
just
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
,
of
course
,
was
checked
,
but
the
young
doctor
's
opinion
had
a
*NL*
decisive
influence
on
the
judges
and
on
the
public
,
and
,
as
appeared
*NL*
afterwards
,
every
one
agreed
with
him
.
But
Doctor
Herzenstube
,
when
called
*NL*
as
a
witness
,
was
quite
unexpectedly
of
use
to
Mitya
.
As
an
old
resident
*NL*
in
the
town
who
had
known
the
Karamazov
family
for
years
,
he
furnished
*NL*
some
facts
of
great
value
for
the
prosecution
,
and
suddenly
,
as
though
*NL*
recalling
something
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
poor
young
man
might
have
had
a
very
different
life
,
for
he
had
a
*NL*
good
heart
both
in
childhood
and
after
childhood
,
that
I
know
.
But
the
*NL*
Russian
proverb
says
,
`
If
a
man
has
one
head
,
it
's
good
,
but
if
another
*NL*
clever
man
comes
to
visit

would
be
better
still

for
then
there
*NL*
will
be
two
heads

not
only
one
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
head
is
good
,
but
two
are
better
,
''
the
prosecutor
put
in
impatiently
.
*NL*
He
knew
the
old
man
's
habit
of
talking
slowly
and
deliberately
,
regardless
*NL*
of
the
impression
he
was
making
and
of
the
delay
he
was
causing
,
and
*NL*
highly
prizing
his
flat
,
dull
and
always
gleefully
complacent
German
wit
.
*NL*
The
old
man
was
fond
of
making
jokes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
that
's
what
I
say
,
''
he
went
on
stubbornly
.
``
One
head
is
good
,
*NL*
but
two
are
much
better
,
but
he
did
not
meet
another
head
with
wits
,
and
*NL*
his
wits
went
.
Where
did
they
go
?
I
've
forgotten
the
word
.
''
He
went
on
,
*NL*
passing
his
hand
before
his
eyes
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
_
spazieren
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wandering
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
wandering
,
that
's
what
I
say
.
Well
,
his
wits
went
wandering
and
*NL*
fell
in
such
a
deep
hole
that
he
lost
himself
.
And
yet
he
was
a
grateful
*NL*
and
sensitive
boy
.
Oh
,
I
remember
him
very
well
,
a
little
chap
so
high
,
*NL*
left
neglected
by
his
father
in
the
back
yard
,
when
he
ran
about
without
*NL*
boots
on
his
feet
,
and
his
little
breeches
hanging
by
one
button
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
note
of
feeling
and
tenderness
suddenly
came
into
the
honest
old
man
's
*NL*
voice
.
Fetyukovitch
positively
started
,
as
though
scenting
something
,
and
*NL*
caught
at
it
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
was
a
young
man
then
...
I
was
...
well
,
I
was
forty-five
*NL*
then
,
and
had
only
just
come
here
.
And
I
was
so
sorry
for
the
boy
then
;
I
*NL*
asked
myself
why
should
n't
I
buy
him
a
pound
of
...
a
pound
of
what
?
I
've
*NL*
forgotten
what
it
's
called
.
A
pound
of
what
children
are
very
fond
of
,
*NL*
what
is
it
,
what
is
it
?
''
The
doctor
began
waving
his
hands
again
.
``
It
*NL*
grows
on
a
tree
and
is
gathered
and
given
to
every
one
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apples
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
.
You
have
a
dozen
of
apples
,
not
a
pound
...
No
,
there
are
a
*NL*
lot
of
them
,
and
all
little
.
You
put
them
in
the
mouth
and
crack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nuts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
nuts
,
I
say
so
.
''
The
doctor
repeated
in
the
calmest
way
as
*NL*
though
he
had
been
at
no
loss
for
a
word
.
``
And
I
bought
him
a
pound
of
*NL*
nuts
,
for
no
one
had
ever
bought
the
boy
a
pound
of
nuts
before
.
And
I
*NL*
lifted
my
finger
and
said
to
him
,
`
Boy
,
_
Gott
der
Vater
_
.
'
He
laughed
and
*NL*
said
,
'
_
Gott
der
Vater
_
.
'
...
'
_
Gott
der
Sohn
_
.
'
He
laughed
again
and
*NL*
lisped
,
'
_
Gott
der
Sohn
_
.
'
'
_
Gott
der
heilige
Geist
_
.
'
Then
he
laughed
and
*NL*
said
as
best
he
could
,
'
_
Gott
der
heilige
Geist
_
.
'
I
went
away
,
and
two
*NL*
days
after
I
happened
to
be
passing
,
and
he
shouted
to
me
of
himself
,
*NL*
`
Uncle
,
_
Gott
der
Vater
,
Gott
der
Sohn
_
,
'
and
he
had
only
forgotten
'
_
Gott
*NL*
der
heilige
Geist
_
.
'
But
I
reminded
him
of
it
and
I
felt
very
sorry
for
*NL*
him
again
.
But
he
was
taken
away
,
and
I
did
not
see
him
again
.
Twenty
-
*NL*
three
years
passed
.
I
am
sitting
one
morning
in
my
study
,
a
white-haired
*NL*
old
man
,
when
there
walks
into
the
room
a
blooming
young
man
,
whom
I
*NL*
should
never
have
recognized
,
but
he
held
up
his
finger
and
said
,
*NL*
laughing
,
'
_
Gott
der
Vater
,
Gott
der
Sohn
_
,
and
_
Gott
der
heilige
Geist
_
.
*NL*
I
have
just
arrived
and
have
come
to
thank
you
for
that
pound
of
nuts
,
for
*NL*
no
one
else
ever
bought
me
a
pound
of
nuts
;
you
are
the
only
one
that
ever
*NL*
did
.
'
And
then
I
remembered
my
happy
youth
and
the
poor
child
in
the
yard
,
*NL*
without
boots
on
his
feet
,
and
my
heart
was
touched
and
I
said
,
`
You
are
a
*NL*
grateful
young
man
,
for
you
have
remembered
all
your
life
the
pound
of
*NL*
nuts
I
bought
you
in
your
childhood
.
'
And
I
embraced
him
and
blessed
him
.
*NL*
And
I
shed
tears
.
He
laughed
,
but
he
shed
tears
,
too
...
for
the
Russian
*NL*
often
laughs
when
he
ought
to
be
weeping
.
But
he
did
weep
;
I
saw
it
.
And
*NL*
now
,
alas
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
weeping
now
,
German
,
I
am
weeping
now
,
too
,
you
saintly
man
,
''
*NL*
Mitya
cried
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
case
the
anecdote
made
a
certain
favorable
impression
on
the
*NL*
public
.
But
the
chief
sensation
in
Mitya
's
favor
was
created
by
the
*NL*
evidence
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
which
I
will
describe
directly
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
when
the
witnesses
_
a
decharge
_
,
that
is
,
called
by
the
defense
,
began
*NL*
giving
evidence
,
fortune
seemed
all
at
once
markedly
more
favorable
to
*NL*
Mitya
,
and
what
was
particularly
striking
,
this
was
a
surprise
even
to
the
*NL*
counsel
for
the
defense
.
But
before
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
called
,
Alyosha
*NL*
was
examined
,
and
he
recalled
a
fact
which
seemed
to
furnish
positive
*NL*
evidence
against
one
important
point
made
by
the
prosecution
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
IV
.
Fortune
Smiles
On
Mitya
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
quite
as
a
surprise
even
to
Alyosha
himself
.
He
was
not
required
*NL*
to
take
the
oath
,
and
I
remember
that
both
sides
addressed
him
very
gently
*NL*
and
sympathetically
.
It
was
evident
that
his
reputation
for
goodness
had
*NL*
preceded
him
.
Alyosha
gave
his
evidence
modestly
and
with
restraint
,
but
*NL*
his
warm
sympathy
for
his
unhappy
brother
was
unmistakable
.
In
answer
to
*NL*
one
question
,
he
sketched
his
brother
's
character
as
that
of
a
man
,
*NL*
violent-tempered
perhaps
and
carried
away
by
his
passions
,
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
honorable
,
proud
and
generous
,
capable
of
self-sacrifice
,
if
*NL*
necessary
.
He
admitted
,
however
,
that
,
through
his
passion
for
Grushenka
*NL*
and
his
rivalry
with
his
father
,
his
brother
had
been
of
late
in
an
*NL*
intolerable
position
.
But
he
repelled
with
indignation
the
suggestion
that
*NL*
his
brother
might
have
committed
a
murder
for
the
sake
of
gain
,
though
he
*NL*
recognized
that
the
three
thousand
roubles
had
become
almost
an
obsession
*NL*
with
Mitya
;
that
he
looked
upon
them
as
part
of
the
inheritance
he
had
*NL*
been
cheated
of
by
his
father
,
and
that
,
indifferent
as
he
was
to
money
as
*NL*
a
rule
,
he
could
not
even
speak
of
that
three
thousand
without
fury
.
As
*NL*
for
the
rivalry
of
the
two
``
ladies
,
''
as
the
prosecutor
expressed
it
--
that
*NL*
is
,
of
Grushenka
and
Katya
--
he
answered
evasively
and
was
even
unwilling
to
*NL*
answer
one
or
two
questions
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your
brother
tell
you
,
anyway
,
that
he
intended
to
kill
your
father
?
''
*NL*
asked
the
prosecutor
.
``
You
can
refuse
to
answer
if
you
think
necessary
,
''
*NL*
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
tell
me
so
directly
,
''
answered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
Did
he
indirectly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spoke
to
me
once
of
his
hatred
for
our
father
and
his
fear
that
at
an
*NL*
extreme
moment
...
at
a
moment
of
fury
,
he
might
perhaps
murder
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
believed
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
to
say
that
I
did
.
But
I
never
doubted
that
some
higher
*NL*
feeling
would
always
save
him
at
the
fatal
moment
,
as
it
has
indeed
saved
*NL*
him
,
for
it
was
not
he
killed
my
father
,
''
Alyosha
said
firmly
,
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
that
was
heard
throughout
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
started
like
a
war-horse
at
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
assure
you
that
I
fully
believe
in
the
complete
sincerity
of
your
*NL*
conviction
and
do
not
explain
it
by
or
identify
it
with
your
affection
for
*NL*
your
unhappy
brother
.
Your
peculiar
view
of
the
whole
tragic
episode
is
*NL*
known
to
us
already
from
the
preliminary
investigation
.
I
wo
n't
attempt
to
*NL*
conceal
from
you
that
it
is
highly
individual
and
contradicts
all
the
*NL*
other
evidence
collected
by
the
prosecution
.
And
so
I
think
it
essential
*NL*
to
press
you
to
tell
me
what
facts
have
led
you
to
this
conviction
of
your
*NL*
brother
's
innocence
and
of
the
guilt
of
another
person
against
whom
you
*NL*
gave
evidence
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
answered
the
questions
asked
me
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
,
''
*NL*
replied
Alyosha
,
slowly
and
calmly
.
``
I
made
no
accusation
against
*NL*
Smerdyakov
of
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
gave
evidence
against
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
led
to
do
so
by
my
brother
Dmitri
's
words
.
I
was
told
what
took
*NL*
place
at
his
arrest
and
how
he
had
pointed
to
Smerdyakov
before
I
was
*NL*
examined
.
I
believe
absolutely
that
my
brother
is
innocent
,
and
if
he
*NL*
did
n't
commit
the
murder
,
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Smerdyakov
?
Why
Smerdyakov
?
And
why
are
you
so
completely
persuaded
*NL*
of
your
brother
's
innocence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
believing
my
brother
.
I
know
he
would
n't
lie
to
me
.
I
saw
*NL*
from
his
face
he
was
n't
lying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
from
his
face
?
Is
that
all
the
proof
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
other
proof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
Smerdyakov
's
guilt
you
have
no
proof
whatever
but
your
brother
's
*NL*
word
and
the
expression
of
his
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
no
other
proof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
dropped
the
examination
at
this
point
.
The
impression
left
*NL*
by
Alyosha
's
evidence
on
the
public
was
most
disappointing
.
There
had
been
*NL*
talk
about
Smerdyakov
before
the
trial
;
some
one
had
heard
something
,
some
*NL*
one
had
pointed
out
something
else
,
it
was
said
that
Alyosha
had
gathered
*NL*
together
some
extraordinary
proofs
of
his
brother
's
innocence
and
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
guilt
,
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
,
no
evidence
except
*NL*
certain
moral
convictions
so
natural
in
a
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fetyukovitch
began
his
cross-examination
.
On
his
asking
Alyosha
when
*NL*
it
was
that
the
prisoner
had
told
him
of
his
hatred
for
his
father
and
*NL*
that
he
might
kill
him
,
and
whether
he
had
heard
it
,
for
instance
,
at
*NL*
their
last
meeting
before
the
catastrophe
,
Alyosha
started
as
he
answered
,
*NL*
as
though
only
just
recollecting
and
understanding
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
one
circumstance
now
which
I
'd
quite
forgotten
myself
.
It
*NL*
was
n't
clear
to
me
at
the
time
,
but
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
obviously
only
now
for
the
first
time
struck
by
an
idea
,
he
recounted
*NL*
eagerly
how
,
at
his
last
interview
with
Mitya
that
evening
under
the
tree
,
*NL*
on
the
road
to
the
monastery
,
Mitya
had
struck
himself
on
the
breast
,
``
the
*NL*
upper
part
of
the
breast
,
''
and
had
repeated
several
times
that
he
had
a
*NL*
means
of
regaining
his
honor
,
that
that
means
was
here
,
here
on
his
*NL*
breast
.
``
I
thought
,
when
he
struck
himself
on
the
breast
,
he
meant
that
it
*NL*
was
in
his
heart
,
''
Alyosha
continued
,
``
that
he
might
find
in
his
heart
*NL*
strength
to
save
himself
from
some
awful
disgrace
which
was
awaiting
him
*NL*
and
which
he
did
not
dare
confess
even
to
me
.
I
must
confess
I
did
think
*NL*
at
the
time
that
he
was
speaking
of
our
father
,
and
that
the
disgrace
he
*NL*
was
shuddering
at
was
the
thought
of
going
to
our
father
and
doing
some
*NL*
violence
to
him
.
Yet
it
was
just
then
that
he
pointed
to
something
on
his
*NL*
breast
,
so
that
I
remember
the
idea
struck
me
at
the
time
that
the
heart
*NL*
is
not
on
that
part
of
the
breast
,
but
below
,
and
that
he
struck
himself
*NL*
much
too
high
,
just
below
the
neck
,
and
kept
pointing
to
that
place
.
My
*NL*
idea
seemed
silly
to
me
at
the
time
,
but
he
was
perhaps
pointing
then
to
*NL*
that
little
bag
in
which
he
had
fifteen
hundred
roubles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
Mitya
cried
from
his
place
.
``
That
's
right
,
Alyosha
,
it
was
the
*NL*
little
bag
I
struck
with
my
fist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
flew
to
him
in
hot
haste
entreating
him
to
keep
quiet
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
instant
pounced
on
Alyosha
.
Alyosha
,
carried
away
himself
by
his
*NL*
recollection
,
warmly
expressed
his
theory
that
this
disgrace
was
probably
*NL*
just
that
fifteen
hundred
roubles
on
him
,
which
he
might
have
returned
to
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
as
half
of
what
he
owed
her
,
but
which
he
had
yet
*NL*
determined
not
to
repay
her
and
to
use
for
another
purpose
--
namely
,
to
*NL*
enable
him
to
elope
with
Grushenka
,
if
she
consented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
,
it
must
be
so
,
''
exclaimed
Alyosha
,
in
sudden
excitement
.
``
My
*NL*
brother
cried
several
times
that
half
of
the
disgrace
,
half
of
it
-LRB-
he
said
*NL*
_
half
_
several
times
-RRB-
he
could
free
himself
from
at
once
,
but
that
he
was
*NL*
so
unhappy
in
his
weakness
of
will
that
he
would
n't
do
it
...
that
he
knew
*NL*
beforehand
he
was
incapable
of
doing
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
clearly
,
confidently
remember
that
he
struck
himself
just
on
this
*NL*
part
of
the
breast
?
''
Fetyukovitch
asked
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clearly
and
confidently
,
for
I
thought
at
the
time
,
`
Why
does
he
strike
*NL*
himself
up
there
when
the
heart
is
lower
down
?
'
and
the
thought
seemed
*NL*
stupid
to
me
at
the
time
...
I
remember
its
seeming
stupid
...
it
flashed
*NL*
through
my
mind
.
That
's
what
brought
it
back
to
me
just
now
.
How
could
I
*NL*
have
forgotten
it
till
now
?
It
was
that
little
bag
he
meant
when
he
said
*NL*
he
had
the
means
but
would
n't
give
back
that
fifteen
hundred
.
And
when
he
*NL*
was
arrested
at
Mokroe
he
cried
out
--
I
know
,
I
was
told
it
--
that
he
*NL*
considered
it
the
most
disgraceful
act
of
his
life
that
when
he
had
the
*NL*
means
of
repaying
Katerina
Ivanovna
half
-LRB-
half
,
note
!
-RRB-
what
he
owed
her
,
*NL*
he
yet
could
not
bring
himself
to
repay
the
money
and
preferred
to
remain
*NL*
a
thief
in
her
eyes
rather
than
part
with
it
.
And
what
torture
,
what
*NL*
torture
that
debt
has
been
to
him
!
''
Alyosha
exclaimed
in
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
,
of
course
,
intervened
.
He
asked
Alyosha
to
describe
once
*NL*
more
how
it
had
all
happened
,
and
several
times
insisted
on
the
question
,
*NL*
``
Had
the
prisoner
seemed
to
point
to
anything
?
Perhaps
he
had
simply
*NL*
struck
himself
with
his
fist
on
the
breast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
not
with
his
fist
,
''
cried
Alyosha
;
``
he
pointed
with
his
*NL*
fingers
and
pointed
here
,
very
high
up
...
How
could
I
have
so
completely
*NL*
forgotten
it
till
this
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
asked
Mitya
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
last
witness
's
*NL*
evidence
.
Mitya
confirmed
it
,
saying
that
he
had
been
pointing
to
the
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
roubles
which
were
on
his
breast
,
just
below
the
neck
,
and
*NL*
that
that
was
,
of
course
,
the
disgrace
,
``
A
disgrace
I
can
not
deny
,
the
*NL*
most
shameful
act
of
my
whole
life
,
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
I
might
have
repaid
it
*NL*
and
did
n't
repay
it
.
I
preferred
to
remain
a
thief
in
her
eyes
rather
than
*NL*
give
it
back
.
And
the
most
shameful
part
of
it
was
that
I
knew
beforehand
*NL*
I
should
n't
give
it
back
!
You
are
right
,
Alyosha
!
Thanks
,
Alyosha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Alyosha
's
cross-examination
ended
.
What
was
important
and
striking
*NL*
about
it
was
that
one
fact
at
least
had
been
found
,
and
even
though
this
*NL*
were
only
one
tiny
bit
of
evidence
,
a
mere
hint
at
evidence
,
it
did
go
*NL*
some
little
way
towards
proving
that
the
bag
had
existed
and
had
contained
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
roubles
and
that
the
prisoner
had
not
been
lying
at
the
*NL*
preliminary
inquiry
when
he
alleged
at
Mokroe
that
those
fifteen
hundred
*NL*
roubles
were
``
his
own
.
''
Alyosha
was
glad
.
With
a
flushed
face
he
moved
*NL*
away
to
the
seat
assigned
to
him
.
He
kept
repeating
to
himself
:
``
How
was
*NL*
it
I
forgot
?
How
could
I
have
forgotten
it
?
And
what
made
it
come
back
to
*NL*
me
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
called
to
the
witness-box
.
As
she
entered
something
*NL*
extraordinary
happened
in
the
court
.
The
ladies
clutched
their
lorgnettes
*NL*
and
opera-glasses
.
There
was
a
stir
among
the
men
:
some
stood
up
to
get
a
*NL*
better
view
.
Everybody
alleged
afterwards
that
Mitya
had
turned
``
white
as
*NL*
a
sheet
''
on
her
entrance
.
All
in
black
,
she
advanced
modestly
,
almost
*NL*
timidly
.
It
was
impossible
to
tell
from
her
face
that
she
was
agitated
;
*NL*
but
there
was
a
resolute
gleam
in
her
dark
and
gloomy
eyes
.
I
may
remark
*NL*
that
many
people
mentioned
that
she
looked
particularly
handsome
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
She
spoke
softly
but
clearly
,
so
that
she
was
heard
all
over
the
*NL*
court
.
She
expressed
herself
with
composure
,
or
at
least
tried
to
appear
*NL*
composed
.
The
President
began
his
examination
discreetly
and
very
*NL*
respectfully
,
as
though
afraid
to
touch
on
``
certain
chords
,
''
and
showing
*NL*
consideration
for
her
great
unhappiness
.
But
in
answer
to
one
of
the
first
*NL*
questions
Katerina
Ivanovna
replied
firmly
that
she
had
been
formerly
*NL*
betrothed
to
the
prisoner
,
``
until
he
left
me
of
his
own
accord
...
''
she
*NL*
added
quietly
.
When
they
asked
her
about
the
three
thousand
she
had
*NL*
entrusted
to
Mitya
to
post
to
her
relations
,
she
said
firmly
,
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
give
him
the
money
simply
to
send
it
off
.
I
felt
at
the
time
that
he
was
*NL*
in
great
need
of
money
...
I
gave
him
the
three
thousand
on
the
*NL*
understanding
that
he
should
post
it
within
the
month
if
he
cared
to
.
*NL*
There
was
no
need
for
him
to
worry
himself
about
that
debt
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
repeat
all
the
questions
asked
her
and
all
her
answers
in
*NL*
detail
.
I
will
only
give
the
substance
of
her
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
would
send
off
that
sum
as
soon
as
he
got
*NL*
money
from
his
father
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
I
have
never
doubted
his
*NL*
disinterestedness
and
his
honesty
...
his
scrupulous
honesty
...
in
money
*NL*
matters
.
He
felt
quite
certain
that
he
would
receive
the
money
from
his
*NL*
father
,
and
spoke
to
me
several
times
about
it
.
I
knew
he
had
a
feud
with
*NL*
his
father
and
have
always
believed
that
he
had
been
unfairly
treated
by
*NL*
his
father
.
I
do
n't
remember
any
threat
uttered
by
him
against
his
father
.
*NL*
He
certainly
never
uttered
any
such
threat
before
me
.
If
he
had
come
to
me
*NL*
at
that
time
,
I
should
have
at
once
relieved
his
anxiety
about
that
*NL*
unlucky
three
thousand
roubles
,
but
he
had
given
up
coming
to
see
me
...
*NL*
and
I
myself
was
put
in
such
a
position
...
that
I
could
not
invite
*NL*
him
...
And
I
had
no
right
,
indeed
,
to
be
exacting
as
to
that
money
,
''
she
*NL*
added
suddenly
,
and
there
was
a
ring
of
resolution
in
her
voice
.
``
I
was
*NL*
once
indebted
to
him
for
assistance
in
money
for
more
than
three
thousand
,
*NL*
and
I
took
it
,
although
I
could
not
at
that
time
foresee
that
I
should
*NL*
ever
be
in
a
position
to
repay
my
debt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
note
of
defiance
in
her
voice
.
It
was
then
Fetyukovitch
began
*NL*
his
cross-examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
that
take
place
not
here
,
but
at
the
beginning
of
your
acquaintance
?
''
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
suggested
cautiously
,
feeling
his
way
,
instantly
scenting
*NL*
something
favorable
.
I
must
mention
in
parenthesis
that
,
though
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
had
been
brought
from
Petersburg
partly
at
the
instance
of
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
herself
,
he
knew
nothing
about
the
episode
of
the
four
*NL*
thousand
roubles
given
her
by
Mitya
,
and
of
her
``
bowing
to
the
ground
to
*NL*
him
.
''
She
concealed
this
from
him
and
said
nothing
about
it
,
and
that
was
*NL*
strange
.
It
may
be
pretty
certainly
assumed
that
she
herself
did
not
know
*NL*
till
the
very
last
minute
whether
she
would
speak
of
that
episode
in
the
*NL*
court
,
and
waited
for
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
I
can
never
forget
those
moments
.
She
began
telling
her
story
.
She
*NL*
told
everything
,
the
whole
episode
that
Mitya
had
told
Alyosha
,
and
her
*NL*
bowing
to
the
ground
,
and
her
reason
.
She
told
about
her
father
and
her
*NL*
going
to
Mitya
,
and
did
not
in
one
word
,
in
a
single
hint
,
suggest
that
*NL*
Mitya
had
himself
,
through
her
sister
,
proposed
they
should
``
send
him
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
''
to
fetch
the
money
.
She
generously
concealed
that
and
*NL*
was
not
ashamed
to
make
it
appear
as
though
she
had
of
her
own
impulse
run
*NL*
to
the
young
officer
,
relying
on
something
...
to
beg
him
for
the
money
.
*NL*
It
was
something
tremendous
!
I
turned
cold
and
trembled
as
I
listened
.
The
*NL*
court
was
hushed
,
trying
to
catch
each
word
.
It
was
something
unexampled
.
*NL*
Even
from
such
a
self-willed
and
contemptuously
proud
girl
as
she
was
,
*NL*
such
an
extremely
frank
avowal
,
such
sacrifice
,
such
self-immolation
,
*NL*
seemed
incredible
.
And
for
what
,
for
whom
?
To
save
the
man
who
had
*NL*
deceived
and
insulted
her
and
to
help
,
in
however
small
a
degree
,
in
*NL*
saving
him
,
by
creating
a
strong
impression
in
his
favor
.
And
,
indeed
,
the
*NL*
figure
of
the
young
officer
who
,
with
a
respectful
bow
to
the
innocent
*NL*
girl
,
handed
her
his
last
four
thousand
roubles
--
all
he
had
in
the
*NL*
world
--
was
thrown
into
a
very
sympathetic
and
attractive
light
,
but
...
I
*NL*
had
a
painful
misgiving
at
heart
!
I
felt
that
calumny
might
come
of
it
*NL*
later
-LRB-
and
it
did
,
in
fact
,
it
did
-RRB-
.
It
was
repeated
all
over
the
town
*NL*
afterwards
with
spiteful
laughter
that
the
story
was
perhaps
not
quite
*NL*
complete
--
that
is
,
in
the
statement
that
the
officer
had
let
the
young
lady
*NL*
depart
``
with
nothing
but
a
respectful
bow
.
''
It
was
hinted
that
something
*NL*
was
here
omitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
even
if
nothing
had
been
omitted
,
if
this
were
the
whole
story
,
''
the
*NL*
most
highly
respected
of
our
ladies
maintained
,
``
even
then
it
's
very
*NL*
doubtful
whether
it
was
creditable
for
a
young
girl
to
behave
in
that
way
,
*NL*
even
for
the
sake
of
saving
her
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
can
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
with
her
intelligence
,
her
morbid
*NL*
sensitiveness
,
have
failed
to
understand
that
people
would
talk
like
that
?
*NL*
She
must
have
understood
it
,
yet
she
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
everything
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
all
these
nasty
little
suspicions
as
to
the
truth
of
her
story
*NL*
only
arose
afterwards
and
at
the
first
moment
all
were
deeply
impressed
by
*NL*
it
.
As
for
the
judges
and
the
lawyers
,
they
listened
in
reverent
,
almost
*NL*
shame-faced
silence
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
The
prosecutor
did
not
venture
*NL*
upon
even
one
question
on
the
subject
.
Fetyukovitch
made
a
low
bow
to
her
.
*NL*
Oh
,
he
was
almost
triumphant
!
Much
ground
had
been
gained
.
For
a
man
to
*NL*
give
his
last
four
thousand
on
a
generous
impulse
and
then
for
the
same
*NL*
man
to
murder
his
father
for
the
sake
of
robbing
him
of
three
thousand
--
the
*NL*
idea
seemed
too
incongruous
.
Fetyukovitch
felt
that
now
the
charge
of
*NL*
theft
,
at
least
,
was
as
good
as
disproved
.
``
The
case
''
was
thrown
into
*NL*
quite
a
different
light
.
There
was
a
wave
of
sympathy
for
Mitya
.
As
for
*NL*
him
...
I
was
told
that
once
or
twice
,
while
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
giving
*NL*
her
evidence
,
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
,
sank
back
again
,
and
hid
his
*NL*
face
in
his
hands
.
But
when
she
had
finished
,
he
suddenly
cried
in
a
*NL*
sobbing
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katya
,
why
have
you
ruined
me
?
''
and
his
sobs
were
audible
all
over
the
*NL*
court
.
But
he
instantly
restrained
himself
,
and
cried
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
am
condemned
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
sat
rigid
in
his
place
,
with
his
teeth
clenched
and
his
arms
*NL*
across
his
chest
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
remained
in
the
court
and
sat
down
in
*NL*
her
place
.
She
was
pale
and
sat
with
her
eyes
cast
down
.
Those
who
were
*NL*
sitting
near
her
declared
that
for
a
long
time
she
shivered
all
over
as
*NL*
though
in
a
fever
.
Grushenka
was
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
approaching
the
sudden
catastrophe
which
was
perhaps
the
final
cause
*NL*
of
Mitya
's
ruin
.
For
I
am
convinced
,
so
is
every
one
--
all
the
lawyers
said
*NL*
the
same
afterwards
--
that
if
the
episode
had
not
occurred
,
the
prisoner
*NL*
would
at
least
have
been
recommended
to
mercy
.
But
of
that
later
.
A
few
*NL*
words
first
about
Grushenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
too
,
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
,
with
her
magnificent
black
shawl
*NL*
on
her
shoulders
.
She
walked
to
the
witness-box
with
her
smooth
,
noiseless
*NL*
tread
,
with
the
slightly
swaying
gait
common
in
women
of
full
figure
.
She
*NL*
looked
steadily
at
the
President
,
turning
her
eyes
neither
to
the
right
*NL*
nor
to
the
left
.
To
my
thinking
she
looked
very
handsome
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
and
not
at
all
pale
,
as
the
ladies
alleged
afterwards
.
They
declared
,
too
,
*NL*
that
she
had
a
concentrated
and
spiteful
expression
.
I
believe
that
she
*NL*
was
simply
irritated
and
painfully
conscious
of
the
contemptuous
and
*NL*
inquisitive
eyes
of
our
scandal-loving
public
.
She
was
proud
and
could
not
*NL*
stand
contempt
.
She
was
one
of
those
people
who
flare
up
,
angry
and
eager
*NL*
to
retaliate
,
at
the
mere
suggestion
of
contempt
.
There
was
an
element
of
*NL*
timidity
,
too
,
of
course
,
and
inward
shame
at
her
own
timidity
,
so
it
was
*NL*
not
strange
that
her
tone
kept
changing
.
At
one
moment
it
was
angry
,
*NL*
contemptuous
and
rough
,
and
at
another
there
was
a
sincere
note
of
self
-
*NL*
condemnation
.
Sometimes
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
taking
a
desperate
*NL*
plunge
;
as
though
she
felt
,
``
I
do
n't
care
what
happens
,
I
'll
say
it
...
''
*NL*
Apropos
of
her
acquaintance
with
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
she
remarked
curtly
,
*NL*
``
That
's
all
nonsense
,
and
was
it
my
fault
that
he
would
pester
me
?
''
But
a
*NL*
minute
later
she
added
,
``
It
was
all
my
fault
.
I
was
laughing
at
them
*NL*
both
--
at
the
old
man
and
at
him
,
too
--
and
I
brought
both
of
them
to
this
.
It
*NL*
was
all
on
account
of
me
it
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Samsonov
's
name
came
up
somehow
.
``
That
's
nobody
's
business
,
''
she
snapped
*NL*
at
once
,
with
a
sort
of
insolent
defiance
.
``
He
was
my
benefactor
;
he
took
*NL*
me
when
I
had
n't
a
shoe
to
my
foot
,
when
my
family
had
turned
me
out
.
''
The
*NL*
President
reminded
her
,
though
very
politely
,
that
she
must
answer
the
*NL*
questions
directly
,
without
going
off
into
irrelevant
details
.
Grushenka
*NL*
crimsoned
and
her
eyes
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
envelope
with
the
notes
in
it
she
had
not
seen
,
but
had
only
heard
*NL*
from
``
that
wicked
wretch
''
that
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
had
an
envelope
with
*NL*
notes
for
three
thousand
in
it
.
``
But
that
was
all
foolishness
.
I
was
only
*NL*
laughing
.
I
would
n't
have
gone
to
him
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
are
you
referring
as
`
that
wicked
wretch
'
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lackey
,
Smerdyakov
,
who
murdered
his
master
and
hanged
himself
last
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
,
of
course
,
at
once
asked
what
ground
she
had
for
such
a
definite
*NL*
accusation
;
but
it
appeared
that
she
,
too
,
had
no
grounds
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
told
me
so
himself
;
you
can
believe
him
.
The
woman
*NL*
who
came
between
us
has
ruined
him
;
she
is
the
cause
of
it
all
,
let
me
*NL*
tell
you
,
''
Grushenka
added
.
She
seemed
to
be
quivering
with
hatred
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
vindictive
note
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
again
asked
to
whom
she
was
referring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
lady
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
there
.
She
sent
for
me
,
offered
me
*NL*
chocolate
,
tried
to
fascinate
me
.
There
's
not
much
true
shame
about
her
,
I
*NL*
can
tell
you
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
the
President
checked
her
sternly
,
begging
her
to
moderate
*NL*
her
language
.
But
the
jealous
woman
's
heart
was
burning
,
and
she
did
not
*NL*
care
what
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
prisoner
was
arrested
at
Mokroe
,
''
the
prosecutor
asked
,
``
every
*NL*
one
saw
and
heard
you
run
out
of
the
next
room
and
cry
out
:
`
It
's
all
my
*NL*
fault
.
We
'll
go
to
Siberia
together
!
'
So
you
already
believed
him
to
have
*NL*
murdered
his
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
what
I
felt
at
the
time
,
''
answered
Grushenka
.
``
Every
one
*NL*
was
crying
out
that
he
had
killed
his
father
,
and
I
felt
that
it
was
my
*NL*
fault
,
that
it
was
on
my
account
he
had
murdered
him
.
But
when
he
said
he
*NL*
was
n't
guilty
,
I
believed
him
at
once
,
and
I
believe
him
now
and
always
*NL*
shall
believe
him
.
He
is
not
the
man
to
tell
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
began
his
cross-examination
.
I
remember
that
among
other
*NL*
things
he
asked
about
Rakitin
and
the
twenty-five
roubles
``
you
paid
him
*NL*
for
bringing
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
Karamazov
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
nothing
strange
about
his
taking
the
money
,
''
sneered
Grushenka
,
*NL*
with
angry
contempt
.
``
He
was
always
coming
to
me
for
money
:
he
used
to
get
*NL*
thirty
roubles
a
month
at
least
out
of
me
,
chiefly
for
luxuries
:
he
had
*NL*
enough
to
keep
him
without
my
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
led
you
to
be
so
liberal
to
Mr.
Rakitin
?
''
Fetyukovitch
asked
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
an
uneasy
movement
on
the
part
of
the
President
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
is
my
cousin
.
His
mother
was
my
mother
's
sister
.
But
he
's
always
*NL*
besought
me
not
to
tell
any
one
here
of
it
,
he
is
so
dreadfully
ashamed
of
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
fact
was
a
complete
surprise
to
every
one
;
no
one
in
the
town
nor
in
*NL*
the
monastery
,
not
even
Mitya
,
knew
of
it
.
I
was
told
that
Rakitin
turned
*NL*
purple
with
shame
where
he
sat
.
Grushenka
had
somehow
heard
before
she
*NL*
came
into
the
court
that
he
had
given
evidence
against
Mitya
,
and
so
she
*NL*
was
angry
.
The
whole
effect
on
the
public
,
of
Rakitin
's
speech
,
of
his
*NL*
noble
sentiments
,
of
his
attacks
upon
serfdom
and
the
political
disorder
*NL*
of
Russia
,
was
this
time
finally
ruined
.
Fetyukovitch
was
satisfied
:
it
*NL*
was
another
godsend
.
Grushenka
's
cross-examination
did
not
last
long
and
,
*NL*
of
course
,
there
could
be
nothing
particularly
new
in
her
evidence
.
She
*NL*
left
a
very
disagreeable
impression
on
the
public
;
hundreds
of
*NL*
contemptuous
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
,
as
she
finished
giving
her
evidence
*NL*
and
sat
down
again
in
the
court
,
at
a
good
distance
from
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
.
Mitya
was
silent
throughout
her
evidence
.
He
sat
as
though
*NL*
turned
to
stone
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
was
called
to
give
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
V
.
A
Sudden
Catastrophe
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
note
that
he
had
been
called
before
Alyosha
.
But
the
usher
of
the
*NL*
court
announced
to
the
President
that
,
owing
to
an
attack
of
illness
or
*NL*
some
sort
of
fit
,
the
witness
could
not
appear
at
the
moment
,
but
was
*NL*
ready
to
give
his
evidence
as
soon
as
he
recovered
.
But
no
one
seemed
to
*NL*
have
heard
it
and
it
only
came
out
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
entrance
was
for
the
first
moment
almost
unnoticed
.
The
principal
*NL*
witnesses
,
especially
the
two
rival
ladies
,
had
already
been
questioned
.
*NL*
Curiosity
was
satisfied
for
the
time
;
the
public
was
feeling
almost
*NL*
fatigued
.
Several
more
witnesses
were
still
to
be
heard
,
who
probably
had
*NL*
little
information
to
give
after
all
that
had
been
given
.
Time
was
*NL*
passing
.
Ivan
walked
up
with
extraordinary
slowness
,
looking
at
no
one
,
*NL*
and
with
his
head
bowed
,
as
though
plunged
in
gloomy
thought
.
He
was
*NL*
irreproachably
dressed
,
but
his
face
made
a
painful
impression
,
on
me
at
*NL*
least
:
there
was
an
earthy
look
in
it
,
a
look
like
a
dying
man
's
.
His
eyes
*NL*
were
lusterless
;
he
raised
them
and
looked
slowly
round
the
court
.
Alyosha
*NL*
jumped
up
from
his
seat
and
moaned
``
Ah
!
''
I
remember
that
,
but
it
was
*NL*
hardly
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
began
by
informing
him
that
he
was
a
witness
not
on
oath
,
*NL*
that
he
might
answer
or
refuse
to
answer
,
but
that
,
of
course
,
he
must
*NL*
bear
witness
according
to
his
conscience
,
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
Ivan
*NL*
listened
and
looked
at
him
blankly
,
but
his
face
gradually
relaxed
into
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
as
soon
as
the
President
,
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
,
*NL*
finished
,
he
laughed
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
else
?
''
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
hush
in
the
court
;
there
was
a
feeling
of
something
strange
.
*NL*
The
President
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
...
are
perhaps
still
unwell
?
''
he
began
,
looking
everywhere
for
the
*NL*
usher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
,
your
excellency
,
I
am
well
enough
and
can
tell
*NL*
you
something
interesting
,
''
Ivan
answered
with
sudden
calmness
and
*NL*
respectfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
some
special
communication
to
make
?
''
the
President
went
on
,
*NL*
still
mistrustfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
looked
down
,
waited
a
few
seconds
and
,
raising
his
head
,
answered
,
*NL*
almost
stammering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
...
I
have
n't
.
I
have
nothing
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
asking
him
questions
.
He
answered
,
as
it
were
,
reluctantly
,
*NL*
with
extreme
brevity
,
with
a
sort
of
disgust
which
grew
more
and
more
*NL*
marked
,
though
he
answered
rationally
.
To
many
questions
he
answered
that
*NL*
he
did
not
know
.
He
knew
nothing
of
his
father
's
money
relations
with
*NL*
Dmitri
.
``
I
was
n't
interested
in
the
subject
,
''
he
added
.
Threats
to
murder
*NL*
his
father
he
had
heard
from
the
prisoner
.
Of
the
money
in
the
envelope
he
*NL*
had
heard
from
Smerdyakov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
thing
over
and
over
again
,
''
he
interrupted
suddenly
,
with
a
look
*NL*
of
weariness
.
``
I
have
nothing
particular
to
tell
the
court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
unwell
and
understand
your
feelings
,
''
the
President
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defense
to
invite
them
*NL*
to
examine
the
witness
,
if
necessary
,
when
Ivan
suddenly
asked
in
an
*NL*
exhausted
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
,
your
excellency
,
I
feel
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
these
words
,
without
waiting
for
permission
,
he
turned
to
walk
*NL*
out
of
the
court
.
But
after
taking
four
steps
he
stood
still
,
as
though
he
*NL*
had
reached
a
decision
,
smiled
slowly
,
and
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
like
the
peasant
girl
,
your
excellency
...
you
know
.
How
does
it
go
?
*NL*
`
I
'll
stand
up
if
I
like
,
and
I
wo
n't
if
I
do
n't
.
'
They
were
trying
to
put
*NL*
on
her
sarafan
to
take
her
to
church
to
be
married
,
and
she
said
,
`
I
'll
*NL*
stand
up
if
I
like
,
and
I
wo
n't
if
I
do
n't
.
'
...
It
's
in
some
book
about
*NL*
the
peasantry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
the
President
asked
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
,
''
Ivan
suddenly
pulled
out
a
roll
of
notes
.
``
Here
's
the
money
*NL*
...
the
notes
that
lay
in
that
envelope
''
-LRB-
he
nodded
towards
the
table
on
*NL*
which
lay
the
material
evidence
-RRB-
,
``
for
the
sake
of
which
our
father
was
*NL*
murdered
.
Where
shall
I
put
them
?
Mr.
Superintendent
,
take
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
of
the
court
took
the
whole
roll
and
handed
it
to
the
President
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
this
money
have
come
into
your
possession
if
it
is
the
same
*NL*
money
?
''
the
President
asked
wonderingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
them
from
Smerdyakov
,
from
the
murderer
,
yesterday
...
I
was
with
*NL*
him
just
before
he
hanged
himself
.
It
was
he
,
not
my
brother
,
killed
our
*NL*
father

He
murdered
him
and
I
incited
him
to
do
it

Who
does
n't
desire
*NL*
his
father
's
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
your
right
mind

broke
involuntarily
from
the
President
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
I
am
in
my
right
mind

in
the
same
nasty
mind
as
all
of

you

as
all
these

ugly
faces

He
turned
suddenly
to
the
audience
.
*NL*
``
My
father
has
been
murdered
and
they
pretend
they
are
horrified
,
''
he
*NL*
snarled
,
with
furious
contempt
.
``
They
keep
up
the
sham
with
one
another

*NL*
Liars

They
all
desire
the
death

One
reptile
devours

another

If
there
had
n't
been
a
murder
,
they
'd
have
been
angry

gone
*NL*
home
ill-humored

spectacle

any

*NL*
He
suddenly
clutched
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
at
once
approached
him
.
Alyosha
jumped
up
and
cried
,
``
He
is
ill
.
*NL*
Do
n't
believe
him
:
he
has
brain
fever

''
Katerina
Ivanovna
rose
impulsively
*NL*
from
her
seat
and
,
rigid
with
horror
,
gazed
at
Ivan
.
Mitya
stood
up
and
*NL*
greedily
looked
at
his
brother
and
listened
to
him
with
a
wild
,
strange
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
disturb
yourselves

I
am
not
mad

I
am
only
a
murderer

''
Ivan
began
*NL*
again
.
``
You
ca
n't
expect
eloquence
from
a
murderer
,
''
he
added
suddenly
for
*NL*
some
reason
and
laughed
a
queer
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prosecutor
bent
over
to
the
President
in
obvious
dismay
.
The
two
other
*NL*
judges
communicated
in
agitated
whispers
.
Fetyukovitch
pricked
up
his
ears
*NL*
as
he
listened
:
the
hall
was
hushed
in
expectation
.
The
President
seemed
*NL*
suddenly
to
recollect
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Witness

your
words
are
incomprehensible

impossible

yourself
,
if
you
can

and
tell
your

if
you
really
have
something
*NL*
to
tell
.
How
can
you
confirm
your
statement
...
if
indeed
you
are
not
*NL*
delirious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
it
.
I
have
no
proof

That
cur
Smerdyakov

n't
send
you

You
think

nothing

envelopes

one
is
enough

I
've
no

except
one

perhaps

he
*NL*
smiled
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
your
witness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
a
tail

_
Do
n't
pay
attention
:
he
is
a
paltry
,
pitiful
devil
,
''
he
*NL*
added
suddenly
.
He
ceased
laughing
and
spoke
as
it
were
,
confidentially
.
*NL*
``
He
is
here
somewhere
,
no
doubt
--
under
that
table
with
the
material
*NL*
evidence
on
it

perhaps
.
Where
should
he
sit
if
not
there
?
You
see
,
listen
*NL*
to
me
.
I
told
him
I
do
n't
want
to
keep
quiet
,
and
he
talked
about
the
*NL*
geological
cataclysm
...
idiocy
!
Come
,
release
the
monster
...
he
's
been
*NL*
singing
a
hymn
.
That
's
because
his
heart
is
light
!
It
's
like
a
drunken
man
*NL*
in
the
street
bawling
how
`
Vanka
went
to
Petersburg
,
'
and
I
would
give
a
*NL*
quadrillion
quadrillions
for
two
seconds
of
joy
.
You
do
n't
know
me
!
Oh
,
*NL*
how
stupid
all
this
business
is
!
Come
,
take
me
instead
of
him
!
I
did
n't
*NL*
come
for
nothing
...
Why
,
why
is
everything
so
stupid
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
slowly
,
and
as
it
were
reflectively
,
looking
round
him
again
.
*NL*
But
the
court
was
all
excitement
by
now
.
Alyosha
rushed
towards
him
,
but
*NL*
the
court
usher
had
already
seized
Ivan
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
about
?
''
he
cried
,
staring
into
the
man
's
face
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
,
he
flung
him
violently
to
the
floor
.
But
the
*NL*
police
were
on
the
spot
and
he
was
seized
.
He
screamed
furiously
.
And
all
*NL*
the
time
he
was
being
removed
,
he
yelled
and
screamed
something
*NL*
incoherent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
court
was
thrown
into
confusion
.
I
do
n't
remember
everything
as
*NL*
it
happened
.
I
was
excited
myself
and
could
not
follow
.
I
only
know
that
*NL*
afterwards
,
when
everything
was
quiet
again
and
every
one
understood
what
*NL*
had
happened
,
the
court
usher
came
in
for
a
reprimand
,
though
he
very
*NL*
reasonably
explained
that
the
witness
had
been
quite
well
,
that
the
doctor
*NL*
had
seen
him
an
hour
ago
,
when
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
giddiness
,
but
*NL*
that
,
until
he
had
come
into
the
court
,
he
had
talked
quite
consecutively
,
*NL*
so
that
nothing
could
have
been
foreseen
--
that
he
had
,
in
fact
,
insisted
on
*NL*
giving
evidence
.
But
before
every
one
had
completely
regained
their
*NL*
composure
and
recovered
from
this
scene
,
it
was
followed
by
another
.
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
an
attack
of
hysterics
.
She
sobbed
,
shrieking
*NL*
loudly
,
but
refused
to
leave
the
court
,
struggled
,
and
besought
them
not
*NL*
to
remove
her
.
Suddenly
she
cried
to
the
President
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
more
evidence
I
must
give
at
once
...
at
once
!
Here
is
a
*NL*
document
,
a
letter
...
take
it
,
read
it
quickly
,
quickly
!
It
's
a
letter
*NL*
from
that
monster
...
that
man
there
,
there
!
''
she
pointed
to
Mitya
.
``
It
*NL*
was
he
killed
his
father
,
you
will
see
that
directly
.
He
wrote
to
me
how
*NL*
he
would
kill
his
father
!
But
the
other
one
is
ill
,
he
is
ill
,
he
is
*NL*
delirious
!
''
she
kept
crying
out
,
beside
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
court
usher
took
the
document
she
held
out
to
the
President
,
and
she
,
*NL*
dropping
into
her
chair
,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
,
began
convulsively
*NL*
and
noiselessly
sobbing
,
shaking
all
over
,
and
stifling
every
sound
for
*NL*
fear
she
should
be
ejected
from
the
court
.
The
document
she
had
handed
up
*NL*
was
that
letter
Mitya
had
written
at
the
``
Metropolis
''
tavern
,
which
Ivan
*NL*
had
spoken
of
as
a
``
mathematical
proof
.
''
Alas
!
its
mathematical
*NL*
conclusiveness
was
recognized
,
and
had
it
not
been
for
that
letter
,
Mitya
*NL*
might
have
escaped
his
doom
or
,
at
least
,
that
doom
would
have
been
less
*NL*
terrible
.
It
was
,
I
repeat
,
difficult
to
notice
every
detail
.
What
*NL*
followed
is
still
confused
to
my
mind
.
The
President
must
,
I
suppose
,
have
*NL*
at
once
passed
on
the
document
to
the
judges
,
the
jury
,
and
the
lawyers
on
*NL*
both
sides
.
I
only
remember
how
they
began
examining
the
witness
.
On
being
*NL*
gently
asked
by
the
President
whether
she
had
recovered
sufficiently
,
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
exclaimed
impetuously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
,
I
am
ready
!
I
am
quite
equal
to
answering
you
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
evidently
still
afraid
that
she
would
somehow
be
prevented
from
giving
*NL*
evidence
.
She
was
asked
to
explain
in
detail
what
this
letter
was
and
*NL*
under
what
circumstances
she
received
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
received
it
the
day
before
the
crime
was
committed
,
but
he
wrote
it
the
*NL*
day
before
that
,
at
the
tavern
--
that
is
,
two
days
before
he
committed
the
*NL*
crime
.
Look
,
it
is
written
on
some
sort
of
bill
!
''
she
cried
breathlessly
.
*NL*
``
He
hated
me
at
that
time
,
because
he
had
behaved
contemptibly
and
was
*NL*
running
after
that
creature
...
and
because
he
owed
me
that
three
*NL*
thousand
...
Oh
!
he
was
humiliated
by
that
three
thousand
on
account
of
*NL*
his
own
meanness
!
This
is
how
it
happened
about
that
three
thousand
.
I
beg
*NL*
you
,
I
beseech
you
,
to
hear
me
.
Three
weeks
before
he
murdered
his
father
,
*NL*
he
came
to
me
one
morning
.
I
knew
he
was
in
want
of
money
,
and
what
he
*NL*
wanted
it
for
.
Yes
,
yes
--
to
win
that
creature
and
carry
her
off
.
I
knew
*NL*
then
that
he
had
been
false
to
me
and
meant
to
abandon
me
,
and
it
was
I
,
*NL*
I
,
who
gave
him
that
money
,
who
offered
it
to
him
on
the
pretext
of
his
*NL*
sending
it
to
my
sister
in
Moscow
.
And
as
I
gave
it
him
,
I
looked
him
in
*NL*
the
face
and
said
that
he
could
send
it
when
he
liked
,
`
in
a
month
's
time
*NL*
would
do
.
'
How
,
how
could
he
have
failed
to
understand
that
I
was
*NL*
practically
telling
him
to
his
face
,
`
You
want
money
to
be
false
to
me
*NL*
with
your
creature
,
so
here
's
the
money
for
you
.
I
give
it
to
you
myself
.
*NL*
Take
it
,
if
you
have
so
little
honor
as
to
take
it
!
'
I
wanted
to
prove
*NL*
what
he
was
,
and
what
happened
?
He
took
it
,
he
took
it
,
and
squandered
it
*NL*
with
that
creature
in
one
night
...
But
he
knew
,
he
knew
that
I
knew
all
*NL*
about
it
.
I
assure
you
he
understood
,
too
,
that
I
gave
him
that
money
to
*NL*
test
him
,
to
see
whether
he
was
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
honor
as
to
take
*NL*
it
from
me
.
I
looked
into
his
eyes
and
he
looked
into
mine
,
and
he
*NL*
understood
it
all
and
he
took
it
--
he
carried
off
my
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
Katya
,
''
Mitya
roared
suddenly
,
``
I
looked
into
your
eyes
and
*NL*
I
knew
that
you
were
dishonoring
me
,
and
yet
I
took
your
money
.
Despise
me
*NL*
as
a
scoundrel
,
despise
me
,
all
of
you
!
I
've
deserved
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prisoner
,
''
cried
the
President
,
``
another
word
and
I
will
order
you
to
be
*NL*
removed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
money
was
a
torment
to
him
,
''
Katya
went
on
with
impulsive
haste
.
``
He
*NL*
wanted
to
repay
it
me
.
He
wanted
to
,
that
's
true
;
but
he
needed
money
for
*NL*
that
creature
,
too
.
So
he
murdered
his
father
,
but
he
did
n't
repay
me
,
and
*NL*
went
off
with
her
to
that
village
where
he
was
arrested
.
There
,
again
,
he
*NL*
squandered
the
money
he
had
stolen
after
the
murder
of
his
father
.
And
a
*NL*
day
before
the
murder
he
wrote
me
this
letter
.
He
was
drunk
when
he
wrote
*NL*
it
.
I
saw
it
at
once
,
at
the
time
.
He
wrote
it
from
spite
,
and
feeling
*NL*
certain
,
positively
certain
,
that
I
should
never
show
it
to
any
one
,
even
*NL*
if
he
did
kill
him
,
or
else
he
would
n't
have
written
it
.
For
he
knew
I
*NL*
should
n't
want
to
revenge
myself
and
ruin
him
!
But
read
it
,
read
it
*NL*
attentively
--
more
attentively
,
please
--
and
you
will
see
that
he
had
*NL*
described
it
all
in
his
letter
,
all
beforehand
,
how
he
would
kill
his
*NL*
father
and
where
his
money
was
kept
.
Look
,
please
,
do
n't
overlook
that
,
*NL*
there
's
one
phrase
there
,
'
I
shall
kill
him
as
soon
as
Ivan
has
gone
*NL*
away
.
'
So
he
thought
it
all
out
beforehand
how
he
would
kill
him
,
''
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
pointed
out
to
the
court
with
venomous
and
malignant
*NL*
triumph
.
Oh
!
it
was
clear
she
had
studied
every
line
of
that
letter
and
*NL*
detected
every
meaning
underlining
it
.
``
If
he
had
n't
been
drunk
,
he
*NL*
would
n't
have
written
to
me
;
but
,
look
,
everything
is
written
there
*NL*
beforehand
,
just
as
he
committed
the
murder
after
.
A
complete
program
of
*NL*
it
!
''
she
exclaimed
frantically
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
reckless
now
of
all
consequences
to
herself
,
though
,
no
doubt
,
she
*NL*
had
foreseen
them
even
a
month
ago
,
for
even
then
,
perhaps
,
shaking
with
*NL*
anger
,
she
had
pondered
whether
to
show
it
at
the
trial
or
not
.
Now
she
*NL*
had
taken
the
fatal
plunge
.
I
remember
that
the
letter
was
read
aloud
by
*NL*
the
clerk
,
directly
afterwards
,
I
believe
.
It
made
an
overwhelming
*NL*
impression
.
They
asked
Mitya
whether
he
admitted
having
written
the
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
mine
,
mine
!
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
I
should
n't
have
written
it
,
if
I
had
n't
*NL*
been
drunk
!
...
We
've
hated
each
other
for
many
things
,
Katya
,
but
I
swear
,
*NL*
I
swear
I
loved
you
even
while
I
hated
you
,
and
you
did
n't
love
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sank
back
on
his
seat
,
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
.
The
prosecutor
*NL*
and
counsel
for
the
defense
began
cross-examining
her
,
chiefly
to
*NL*
ascertain
what
had
induced
her
to
conceal
such
a
document
and
to
give
her
*NL*
evidence
in
quite
a
different
tone
and
spirit
just
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
I
was
telling
lies
just
now
.
I
was
lying
against
my
honor
and
*NL*
my
conscience
,
but
I
wanted
to
save
him
,
for
he
has
hated
and
despised
me
*NL*
so
!
''
Katya
cried
madly
.
``
Oh
,
he
has
despised
me
horribly
,
he
has
always
*NL*
despised
me
,
and
do
you
know
,
he
has
despised
me
from
the
very
moment
that
*NL*
I
bowed
down
to
him
for
that
money
.
I
saw
that
...
I
felt
it
at
once
at
*NL*
the
time
,
but
for
a
long
time
I
would
n't
believe
it
.
How
often
I
have
read
*NL*
it
in
his
eyes
,
`
You
came
of
yourself
,
though
.
'
Oh
,
he
did
n't
understand
,
*NL*
he
had
no
idea
why
I
ran
to
him
,
he
can
suspect
nothing
but
baseness
,
he
*NL*
judged
me
by
himself
,
he
thought
every
one
was
like
himself
!
''
Katya
hissed
*NL*
furiously
,
in
a
perfect
frenzy
.
``
And
he
only
wanted
to
marry
me
,
because
*NL*
I
'd
inherited
a
fortune
,
because
of
that
,
because
of
that
!
I
always
*NL*
suspected
it
was
because
of
that
!
Oh
,
he
is
a
brute
!
He
was
always
*NL*
convinced
that
I
should
be
trembling
with
shame
all
my
life
before
him
,
*NL*
because
I
went
to
him
then
,
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
despise
me
for
ever
*NL*
for
it
,
and
so
to
be
superior
to
me
--
that
's
why
he
wanted
to
marry
me
!
*NL*
That
's
so
,
that
's
all
so
!
I
tried
to
conquer
him
by
my
love
--
a
love
that
*NL*
knew
no
bounds
.
I
even
tried
to
forgive
his
faithlessness
;
but
he
*NL*
understood
nothing
,
nothing
!
How
could
he
understand
indeed
?
He
is
a
*NL*
monster
!
I
only
received
that
letter
the
next
evening
:
it
was
brought
me
*NL*
from
the
tavern
--
and
only
that
morning
,
only
that
morning
I
wanted
to
*NL*
forgive
him
everything
,
everything
--
even
his
treachery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
and
the
prosecutor
,
of
course
,
tried
to
calm
her
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
thinking
that
they
felt
ashamed
of
taking
advantage
of
her
hysteria
*NL*
and
of
listening
to
such
avowals
.
I
remember
hearing
them
say
to
her
,
``
We
*NL*
understand
how
hard
it
is
for
you
;
be
sure
we
are
able
to
feel
for
you
,
''
*NL*
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
And
yet
they
dragged
the
evidence
out
of
the
raving
,
*NL*
hysterical
woman
.
She
described
at
last
with
extraordinary
clearness
,
*NL*
which
is
so
often
seen
,
though
only
for
a
moment
,
in
such
over-wrought
*NL*
states
,
how
Ivan
had
been
nearly
driven
out
of
his
mind
during
the
last
*NL*
two
months
trying
to
save
``
the
monster
and
murderer
,
''
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
tortured
himself
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
he
was
always
trying
to
minimize
*NL*
his
brother
's
guilt
and
confessing
to
me
that
he
,
too
,
had
never
loved
his
*NL*
father
,
and
perhaps
desired
his
death
himself
.
Oh
,
he
has
a
tender
,
over
-
*NL*
tender
conscience
!
He
tormented
himself
with
his
conscience
!
He
told
me
*NL*
everything
,
everything
!
He
came
every
day
and
talked
to
me
as
his
only
*NL*
friend
.
I
have
the
honor
to
be
his
only
friend
!
''
she
cried
suddenly
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
defiance
,
and
her
eyes
flashed
.
``
He
had
been
twice
to
see
*NL*
Smerdyakov
.
One
day
he
came
to
me
and
said
,
`
If
it
was
not
my
brother
,
but
*NL*
Smerdyakov
committed
the
murder
'
-LRB-
for
the
legend
was
circulating
*NL*
everywhere
that
Smerdyakov
had
done
it
-RRB-
,
`
perhaps
I
too
am
guilty
,
for
*NL*
Smerdyakov
knew
I
did
n't
like
my
father
and
perhaps
believed
that
I
*NL*
desired
my
father
's
death
.
'
Then
I
brought
out
that
letter
and
showed
it
*NL*
him
.
He
was
entirely
convinced
that
his
brother
had
done
it
,
and
he
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
it
.
He
could
n't
endure
the
thought
that
his
own
brother
was
*NL*
a
parricide
!
Only
a
week
ago
I
saw
that
it
was
making
him
ill
.
During
the
*NL*
last
few
days
he
has
talked
incoherently
in
my
presence
.
I
saw
his
mind
*NL*
was
giving
way
.
He
walked
about
,
raving
;
he
was
seen
muttering
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
The
doctor
from
Moscow
,
at
my
request
,
examined
him
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
and
told
me
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
brain
fever
--
and
all
*NL*
on
his
account
,
on
account
of
this
monster
!
And
last
night
he
learnt
that
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
dead
!
It
was
such
a
shock
that
it
drove
him
out
of
his
mind
*NL*
...
and
all
through
this
monster
,
all
for
the
sake
of
saving
the
monster
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
of
course
,
such
an
outpouring
,
such
an
avowal
is
only
possible
once
in
*NL*
a
lifetime
--
at
the
hour
of
death
,
for
instance
,
on
the
way
to
the
scaffold
!
*NL*
But
it
was
in
Katya
's
character
,
and
it
was
such
a
moment
in
her
life
.
It
*NL*
was
the
same
impetuous
Katya
who
had
thrown
herself
on
the
mercy
of
a
*NL*
young
profligate
to
save
her
father
;
the
same
Katya
who
had
just
before
,
*NL*
in
her
pride
and
chastity
,
sacrificed
herself
and
her
maidenly
modesty
*NL*
before
all
these
people
,
telling
of
Mitya
's
generous
conduct
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
softening
his
fate
a
little
.
And
now
,
again
,
she
sacrificed
herself
;
*NL*
but
this
time
it
was
for
another
,
and
perhaps
only
now
--
perhaps
only
at
*NL*
this
moment
--
she
felt
and
knew
how
dear
that
other
was
to
her
!
She
had
*NL*
sacrificed
herself
in
terror
for
him
,
conceiving
all
of
a
sudden
that
he
*NL*
had
ruined
himself
by
his
confession
that
it
was
he
who
had
committed
the
*NL*
murder
,
not
his
brother
,
she
had
sacrificed
herself
to
save
him
,
to
save
*NL*
his
good
name
,
his
reputation
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
one
terrible
doubt
occurred
to
one
--
was
she
lying
in
her
*NL*
description
of
her
former
relations
with
Mitya
?
--
that
was
the
question
.
No
,
*NL*
she
had
not
intentionally
slandered
him
when
she
cried
that
Mitya
despised
*NL*
her
for
her
bowing
down
to
him
!
She
believed
it
herself
.
She
had
been
*NL*
firmly
convinced
,
perhaps
ever
since
that
bow
,
that
the
simple-hearted
*NL*
Mitya
,
who
even
then
adored
her
,
was
laughing
at
her
and
despising
her
.
*NL*
She
had
loved
him
with
an
hysterical
,
``
lacerated
''
love
only
from
pride
,
*NL*
from
wounded
pride
,
and
that
love
was
not
like
love
,
but
more
like
*NL*
revenge
.
Oh
!
perhaps
that
lacerated
love
would
have
grown
into
real
love
,
*NL*
perhaps
Katya
longed
for
nothing
more
than
that
,
but
Mitya
's
faithlessness
*NL*
had
wounded
her
to
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
and
her
heart
could
not
*NL*
forgive
him
.
The
moment
of
revenge
had
come
upon
her
suddenly
,
and
all
*NL*
that
had
been
accumulating
so
long
and
so
painfully
in
the
offended
*NL*
woman
's
breast
burst
out
all
at
once
and
unexpectedly
.
She
betrayed
Mitya
,
*NL*
but
she
betrayed
herself
,
too
.
And
no
sooner
had
she
given
full
expression
*NL*
to
her
feelings
than
the
tension
of
course
was
over
and
she
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
shame
.
Hysterics
began
again
:
she
fell
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
sobbing
and
screaming
.
She
was
carried
out
.
At
that
moment
Grushenka
,
with
*NL*
a
wail
,
rushed
towards
Mitya
before
they
had
time
to
prevent
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
''
she
wailed
,
``
your
serpent
has
destroyed
you
!
There
,
she
has
shown
*NL*
you
what
she
is
!
''
she
shouted
to
the
judges
,
shaking
with
anger
.
At
a
*NL*
signal
from
the
President
they
seized
her
and
tried
to
remove
her
from
the
*NL*
court
.
She
would
n't
allow
it
.
She
fought
and
struggled
to
get
back
to
*NL*
Mitya
.
Mitya
uttered
a
cry
and
struggled
to
get
to
her
.
He
was
*NL*
overpowered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
think
the
ladies
who
came
to
see
the
spectacle
must
have
been
*NL*
satisfied
--
the
show
had
been
a
varied
one
.
Then
I
remember
the
Moscow
*NL*
doctor
appeared
on
the
scene
.
I
believe
the
President
had
previously
sent
*NL*
the
court
usher
to
arrange
for
medical
aid
for
Ivan
.
The
doctor
announced
*NL*
to
the
court
that
the
sick
man
was
suffering
from
a
dangerous
attack
of
*NL*
brain
fever
,
and
that
he
must
be
at
once
removed
.
In
answer
to
questions
*NL*
from
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defense
he
said
that
the
*NL*
patient
had
come
to
him
of
his
own
accord
the
day
before
yesterday
and
*NL*
that
he
had
warned
him
that
he
had
such
an
attack
coming
on
,
but
he
had
*NL*
not
consented
to
be
looked
after
.
``
He
was
certainly
not
in
a
normal
state
*NL*
of
mind
:
he
told
me
himself
that
he
saw
visions
when
he
was
awake
,
that
he
*NL*
met
several
persons
in
the
street
,
who
were
dead
,
and
that
Satan
visited
*NL*
him
every
evening
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
in
conclusion
.
Having
given
his
*NL*
evidence
,
the
celebrated
doctor
withdrew
.
The
letter
produced
by
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
was
added
to
the
material
proofs
.
After
some
deliberation
,
the
*NL*
judges
decided
to
proceed
with
the
trial
and
to
enter
both
the
unexpected
*NL*
pieces
of
evidence
-LRB-
given
by
Ivan
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
-RRB-
on
the
protocol
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
will
not
detail
the
evidence
of
the
other
witnesses
,
who
only
*NL*
repeated
and
confirmed
what
had
been
said
before
,
though
all
with
their
*NL*
characteristic
peculiarities
.
I
repeat
,
all
was
brought
together
in
the
*NL*
prosecutor
's
speech
,
which
I
shall
quote
immediately
.
Every
one
was
*NL*
excited
,
every
one
was
electrified
by
the
late
catastrophe
,
and
all
were
*NL*
awaiting
the
speeches
for
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
with
intense
*NL*
impatience
.
Fetyukovitch
was
obviously
shaken
by
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
evidence
.
But
the
prosecutor
was
triumphant
.
When
all
the
evidence
had
*NL*
been
taken
,
the
court
was
adjourned
for
almost
an
hour
.
I
believe
it
was
*NL*
just
eight
o'clock
when
the
President
returned
to
his
seat
and
our
*NL*
prosecutor
,
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
,
began
his
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
VI
.
The
Prosecutor
's
Speech
.
Sketches
Of
Character
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
began
his
speech
,
trembling
with
nervousness
,
with
*NL*
cold
sweat
on
his
forehead
,
feeling
hot
and
cold
all
over
by
turns
.
He
*NL*
described
this
himself
afterwards
.
He
regarded
this
speech
as
his
_
chef
-
*NL*
d'oeuvre
_
,
the
_
chef-d'oeuvre
_
of
his
whole
life
,
as
his
swan-song
.
He
died
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
nine
months
later
of
rapid
consumption
,
so
that
he
had
the
*NL*
right
,
as
it
turned
out
,
to
compare
himself
to
a
swan
singing
his
last
*NL*
song
.
He
had
put
his
whole
heart
and
all
the
brain
he
had
into
that
*NL*
speech
.
And
poor
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
unexpectedly
revealed
that
at
least
*NL*
some
feeling
for
the
public
welfare
and
``
the
eternal
question
''
lay
*NL*
concealed
in
him
.
Where
his
speech
really
excelled
was
in
its
sincerity
.
*NL*
He
genuinely
believed
in
the
prisoner
's
guilt
;
he
was
accusing
him
not
as
*NL*
an
official
duty
only
,
and
in
calling
for
vengeance
he
quivered
with
a
*NL*
genuine
passion
``
for
the
security
of
society
.
''
Even
the
ladies
in
the
*NL*
audience
,
though
they
remained
hostile
to
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
,
admitted
*NL*
that
he
made
an
extraordinary
impression
on
them
.
He
began
in
a
breaking
*NL*
voice
,
but
it
soon
gained
strength
and
filled
the
court
to
the
end
of
his
*NL*
speech
.
But
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
,
he
almost
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
''
began
the
prosecutor
,
``
this
case
has
made
a
stir
*NL*
throughout
Russia
.
But
what
is
there
to
wonder
at
,
what
is
there
so
*NL*
peculiarly
horrifying
in
it
for
us
?
We
are
so
accustomed
to
such
crimes
!
*NL*
That
's
what
's
so
horrible
,
that
such
dark
deeds
have
ceased
to
horrify
us
.
*NL*
What
ought
to
horrify
us
is
that
we
are
so
accustomed
to
it
,
and
not
this
*NL*
or
that
isolated
crime
.
What
are
the
causes
of
our
indifference
,
our
*NL*
lukewarm
attitude
to
such
deeds
,
to
such
signs
of
the
times
,
ominous
of
an
*NL*
unenviable
future
?
Is
it
our
cynicism
,
is
it
the
premature
exhaustion
of
*NL*
intellect
and
imagination
in
a
society
that
is
sinking
into
decay
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
its
youth
?
Is
it
that
our
moral
principles
are
shattered
to
their
*NL*
foundations
,
or
is
it
,
perhaps
,
a
complete
lack
of
such
principles
among
*NL*
us
?
I
can
not
answer
such
questions
;
nevertheless
they
are
disturbing
,
and
*NL*
every
citizen
not
only
must
,
but
ought
to
be
harassed
by
them
.
Our
newborn
*NL*
and
still
timid
press
has
done
good
service
to
the
public
already
,
for
*NL*
without
it
we
should
never
have
heard
of
the
horrors
of
unbridled
violence
*NL*
and
moral
degradation
which
are
continually
made
known
by
the
press
,
not
*NL*
merely
to
those
who
attend
the
new
jury
courts
established
in
the
present
*NL*
reign
,
but
to
every
one
.
And
what
do
we
read
almost
daily
?
Of
things
*NL*
beside
which
the
present
case
grows
pale
,
and
seems
almost
commonplace
.
*NL*
But
what
is
most
important
is
that
the
majority
of
our
national
crimes
of
*NL*
violence
bear
witness
to
a
widespread
evil
,
now
so
general
among
us
that
*NL*
it
is
difficult
to
contend
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
we
see
a
brilliant
young
officer
of
high
society
,
at
the
very
*NL*
outset
of
his
career
,
in
a
cowardly
underhand
way
,
without
a
pang
of
*NL*
conscience
,
murdering
an
official
who
had
once
been
his
benefactor
,
and
*NL*
the
servant
girl
,
to
steal
his
own
I.O.U.
and
what
ready
money
he
could
*NL*
find
on
him
;
`
it
will
come
in
handy
for
my
pleasures
in
the
fashionable
*NL*
world
and
for
my
career
in
the
future
.
'
After
murdering
them
,
he
puts
*NL*
pillows
under
the
head
of
each
of
his
victims
;
he
goes
away
.
Next
,
a
young
*NL*
hero
`
decorated
for
bravery
'
kills
the
mother
of
his
chief
and
benefactor
,
*NL*
like
a
highwayman
,
and
to
urge
his
companions
to
join
him
he
asserts
that
*NL*
`
she
loves
him
like
a
son
,
and
so
will
follow
all
his
directions
and
take
*NL*
no
precautions
.
'
Granted
that
he
is
a
monster
,
yet
I
dare
not
say
in
these
*NL*
days
that
he
is
unique
.
Another
man
will
not
commit
the
murder
,
but
will
*NL*
feel
and
think
like
him
,
and
is
as
dishonorable
in
soul
.
In
silence
,
alone
*NL*
with
his
conscience
,
he
asks
himself
perhaps
,
`
What
is
honor
,
and
is
n't
*NL*
the
condemnation
of
bloodshed
a
prejudice
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
people
will
cry
out
against
me
that
I
am
morbid
,
hysterical
,
that
*NL*
it
is
a
monstrous
slander
,
that
I
am
exaggerating
.
Let
them
say
so
--
and
*NL*
heavens
!
I
should
be
the
first
to
rejoice
if
it
were
so
!
Oh
,
do
n't
believe
*NL*
me

think
of
me
as
morbid

but
remember
my
words

if
only
a
tenth
,
if
only
*NL*
a
twentieth
part
of
what
I
say
is
true
--
even
so
it
's
awful
!
Look
how
our
*NL*
young
people
commit
suicide
,
without
asking
themselves
Hamlet
's
question
*NL*
what
there
is
beyond
,
without
a
sign
of
such
a
question
,
as
though
all
*NL*
that
relates
to
the
soul
and
to
what
awaits
us
beyond
the
grave
had
long
*NL*
been
erased
in
their
minds
and
buried
under
the
sands

Look
at
our
vice

*NL*
at
our
profligates

Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
the
luckless
victim
in
the
present

was
almost
an
innocent
babe

with
many
of

worth
it
.
But
*NL*
this
study
will
come
later
,
at
leisure
,
when
all
the
tragic
topsy-turvydom
*NL*
of
to-day
is
farther
behind
us
,
so
that
it
's
possible
to
examine
it
with
*NL*
more
insight
and
more
impartiality
than
I
can
do
.
Now
we
are
either
*NL*
horrified
or
pretend
to
be
horrified
,
though
we
really
gloat
over
the
*NL*
spectacle
,
and
love
strong
and
eccentric
sensations
which
tickle
our
*NL*
cynical
,
pampered
idleness
.
Or
,
like
little
children
,
we
brush
the
*NL*
dreadful
ghosts
away
and
hide
our
heads
in
the
pillow
so
as
to
return
to
*NL*
our
sports
and
merriment
as
soon
as
they
have
vanished
.
But
we
must
one
*NL*
day
begin
life
in
sober
earnest
,
we
must
look
at
ourselves
as
a
society
;
*NL*
it
's
time
we
tried
to
grasp
something
of
our
social
position
,
or
at
least
*NL*
to
make
a
beginning
in
that
direction
.

``
A
great
writer
-LRB-
9
-RRB-
of
the
last
epoch
,
comparing
Russia
to
a
swift
troika
*NL*
galloping
to
an
unknown
goal
,
exclaims
,
`
Oh
,
troika
,
birdlike
troika
,
who
*NL*
invented
thee
!
'
and
adds
,
in
proud
ecstasy
,
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
*NL*
world
stand
aside
respectfully
to
make
way
for
the
recklessly
galloping
*NL*
troika
to
pass
.
That
may
be
,
they
may
stand
aside
,
respectfully
or
no
,
but
*NL*
in
my
poor
opinion
the
great
writer
ended
his
book
in
this
way
either
in
*NL*
an
access
of
childish
and
naive
optimism
,
or
simply
in
fear
of
the
*NL*
censorship
of
the
day
.
For
if
the
troika
were
drawn
by
his
heroes
,
*NL*
Sobakevitch
,
Nozdryov
,
Tchitchikov
,
it
could
reach
no
rational
goal
,
*NL*
whoever
might
be
driving
it
.
And
those
were
the
heroes
of
an
older
*NL*
generation
,
ours
are
worse
specimens
still
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
's
speech
was
interrupted
by
applause
.
*NL*
The
liberal
significance
of
this
simile
was
appreciated
.
The
applause
was
,
*NL*
it
's
true
,
of
brief
duration
,
so
that
the
President
did
not
think
it
*NL*
necessary
to
caution
the
public
,
and
only
looked
severely
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
offenders
.
But
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
was
encouraged
;
he
had
never
*NL*
been
applauded
before
!
He
had
been
all
his
life
unable
to
get
a
hearing
,
*NL*
and
now
he
suddenly
had
an
opportunity
of
securing
the
ear
of
all
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
after
all
,
is
this
Karamazov
family
,
which
has
gained
such
an
*NL*
unenviable
notoriety
throughout
Russia
?
''
he
continued
.
``
Perhaps
I
am
*NL*
exaggerating
,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
certain
fundamental
features
of
the
*NL*
educated
class
of
to-day
are
reflected
in
this
family
picture
--
only
,
of
*NL*
course
,
in
miniature
,
`
like
the
sun
in
a
drop
of
water
.
'
Think
of
that
*NL*
unhappy
,
vicious
,
unbridled
old
man
,
who
has
met
with
such
a
melancholy
*NL*
end
,
the
head
of
a
family
!
Beginning
life
of
noble
birth
,
but
in
a
poor
*NL*
dependent
position
,
through
an
unexpected
marriage
he
came
into
a
small
*NL*
fortune
.
A
petty
knave
,
a
toady
and
buffoon
,
of
fairly
good
,
though
*NL*
undeveloped
,
intelligence
,
he
was
,
above
all
,
a
moneylender
,
who
grew
*NL*
bolder
with
growing
prosperity
.
His
abject
and
servile
characteristics
*NL*
disappeared
,
his
malicious
and
sarcastic
cynicism
was
all
that
remained
.
*NL*
On
the
spiritual
side
he
was
undeveloped
,
while
his
vitality
was
*NL*
excessive
.
He
saw
nothing
in
life
but
sensual
pleasure
,
and
he
brought
his
*NL*
children
up
to
be
the
same
.
He
had
no
feelings
for
his
duties
as
a
father
.
*NL*
He
ridiculed
those
duties
.
He
left
his
little
children
to
the
servants
,
*NL*
and
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
,
forgot
about
them
completely
.
The
old
*NL*
man
's
maxim
was
_
Apres
moi
le
deluge
_
.
He
was
an
example
of
everything
*NL*
that
is
opposed
to
civic
duty
,
of
the
most
complete
and
malignant
*NL*
individualism
.
`
The
world
may
burn
for
aught
I
care
,
so
long
as
I
am
all
*NL*
right
,
'
and
he
was
all
right
;
he
was
content
,
he
was
eager
to
go
on
living
*NL*
in
the
same
way
for
another
twenty
or
thirty
years
.
He
swindled
his
own
*NL*
son
and
spent
his
money
,
his
maternal
inheritance
,
on
trying
to
get
his
*NL*
mistress
from
him
.
No
,
I
do
n't
intend
to
leave
the
prisoner
's
defense
*NL*
altogether
to
my
talented
colleague
from
Petersburg
.
I
will
speak
the
*NL*
truth
myself
,
I
can
well
understand
what
resentment
he
had
heaped
up
in
*NL*
his
son
's
heart
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
enough
,
enough
of
that
unhappy
old
man
;
he
has
paid
the
penalty
.
Let
*NL*
us
remember
,
however
,
that
he
was
a
father
,
and
one
of
the
typical
fathers
*NL*
of
to-day
.
Am
I
unjust
,
indeed
,
in
saying
that
he
is
typical
of
many
*NL*
modern
fathers
?
Alas
!
many
of
them
only
differ
in
not
openly
professing
*NL*
such
cynicism
,
for
they
are
better
educated
,
more
cultured
,
but
their
*NL*
philosophy
is
essentially
the
same
as
his
.
Perhaps
I
am
a
pessimist
,
but
*NL*
you
have
agreed
to
forgive
me
.
Let
us
agree
beforehand
,
you
need
not
*NL*
believe
me
,
but
let
me
speak
.
Let
me
say
what
I
have
to
say
,
and
remember
*NL*
something
of
my
words

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
the
children
of
this
father
,
this
head
of
a
family
.
One
of
them
*NL*
is
the
prisoner
before
us
,
all
the
rest
of
my
speech
will
deal
with
him
.
*NL*
Of
the
other
two
I
will
speak
only
cursorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
elder
is
one
of
those
modern
young
men
of
brilliant
education
and
*NL*
vigorous
intellect
,
who
has
lost
all
faith
in
everything
.
He
has
denied
*NL*
and
rejected
much
already
,
like
his
father
.
We
have
all
heard
him
,
he
was
*NL*
a
welcome
guest
in
local
society
.
He
never
concealed
his
opinions
,
quite
*NL*
the
contrary
in
fact
,
which
justifies
me
in
speaking
rather
openly
of
him
*NL*
now
,
of
course
,
not
as
an
individual
,
but
as
a
member
of
the
Karamazov
*NL*
family
.
Another
personage
closely
connected
with
the
case
died
here
by
his
*NL*
own
hand
last
night
.
I
mean
an
afflicted
idiot
,
formerly
the
servant
,
and
*NL*
possibly
the
illegitimate
son
,
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
Smerdyakov
.
At
the
*NL*
preliminary
inquiry
,
he
told
me
with
hysterical
tears
how
the
young
Ivan
*NL*
Karamazov
had
horrified
him
by
his
spiritual
audacity
.
`
Everything
in
the
*NL*
world
is
lawful
according
to
him
,
and
nothing
must
be
forbidden
in
the
*NL*
future
--
that
is
what
he
always
taught
me
.
'
I
believe
that
idiot
was
driven
*NL*
out
of
his
mind
by
this
theory
,
though
,
of
course
,
the
epileptic
attacks
*NL*
from
which
he
suffered
,
and
this
terrible
catastrophe
,
have
helped
to
*NL*
unhinge
his
faculties
.
But
he
dropped
one
very
interesting
observation
,
*NL*
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
more
intelligent
observer
,
and
that
is
,
*NL*
indeed
,
why
I
've
mentioned
it
:
`
If
there
is
one
of
the
sons
that
is
like
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
in
character
,
it
is
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
that
remark
I
conclude
my
sketch
of
his
character
,
feeling
it
*NL*
indelicate
to
continue
further
.
Oh
,
I
do
n't
want
to
draw
any
further
*NL*
conclusions
and
croak
like
a
raven
over
the
young
man
's
future
.
We
've
seen
*NL*
to-day
in
this
court
that
there
are
still
good
impulses
in
his
young
*NL*
heart
,
that
family
feeling
has
not
been
destroyed
in
him
by
lack
of
faith
*NL*
and
cynicism
,
which
have
come
to
him
rather
by
inheritance
than
by
the
*NL*
exercise
of
independent
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
third
son
.
Oh
,
he
is
a
devout
and
modest
youth
,
who
does
not
*NL*
share
his
elder
brother
's
gloomy
and
destructive
theory
of
life
.
He
has
*NL*
sought
to
cling
to
the
`
ideas
of
the
people
,
'
or
to
what
goes
by
that
name
*NL*
in
some
circles
of
our
intellectual
classes
.
He
clung
to
the
monastery
,
*NL*
and
was
within
an
ace
of
becoming
a
monk
.
He
seems
to
me
to
have
betrayed
*NL*
unconsciously
,
and
so
early
,
that
timid
despair
which
leads
so
many
in
our
*NL*
unhappy
society
,
who
dread
cynicism
and
its
corrupting
influences
,
and
*NL*
mistakenly
attribute
all
the
mischief
to
European
enlightenment
,
to
return
*NL*
to
their
`
native
soil
,
'
as
they
say
,
to
the
bosom
,
so
to
speak
,
of
their
*NL*
mother
earth
,
like
frightened
children
,
yearning
to
fall
asleep
on
the
*NL*
withered
bosom
of
their
decrepit
mother
,
and
to
sleep
there
for
ever
,
only
*NL*
to
escape
the
horrors
that
terrify
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
I
wish
the
excellent
and
gifted
young
man
every
success
;
I
*NL*
trust
that
his
youthful
idealism
and
impulse
towards
the
ideas
of
the
*NL*
people
may
never
degenerate
,
as
often
happens
,
on
the
moral
side
into
*NL*
gloomy
mysticism
,
and
on
the
political
into
blind
chauvinism
--
two
elements
*NL*
which
are
even
a
greater
menace
to
Russia
than
the
premature
decay
,
due
to
*NL*
misunderstanding
and
gratuitous
adoption
of
European
ideas
,
from
which
his
*NL*
elder
brother
is
suffering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
people
clapped
their
hands
at
the
mention
of
chauvinism
and
*NL*
mysticism
.
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
had
been
,
indeed
,
carried
away
by
his
own
*NL*
eloquence
.
All
this
had
little
to
do
with
the
case
in
hand
,
to
say
nothing
*NL*
of
the
fact
of
its
being
somewhat
vague
,
but
the
sickly
and
consumptive
*NL*
man
was
overcome
by
the
desire
to
express
himself
once
in
his
life
.
People
*NL*
said
afterwards
that
he
was
actuated
by
unworthy
motives
in
his
criticism
*NL*
of
Ivan
,
because
the
latter
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
got
the
better
of
*NL*
him
in
argument
,
and
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
,
remembering
it
,
tried
now
to
*NL*
take
his
revenge
.
But
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
true
.
All
this
was
only
*NL*
introductory
,
however
,
and
the
speech
passed
to
more
direct
consideration
*NL*
of
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
to
return
to
the
eldest
son
,
''
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
went
on
.
``
He
is
*NL*
the
prisoner
before
us
.
We
have
his
life
and
his
actions
,
too
,
before
us
;
*NL*
the
fatal
day
has
come
and
all
has
been
brought
to
the
surface
.
While
his
*NL*
brothers
seem
to
stand
for
`
Europeanism
'
and
`
the
principles
of
the
*NL*
people
,
'
he
seems
to
represent
Russia
as
she
is
.
Oh
,
not
all
Russia
,
not
*NL*
all
!
God
preserve
us
,
if
it
were
!
Yet
,
here
we
have
her
,
our
mother
*NL*
Russia
,
the
very
scent
and
sound
of
her
.
Oh
,
he
is
spontaneous
,
he
is
a
*NL*
marvelous
mingling
of
good
and
evil
,
he
is
a
lover
of
culture
and
*NL*
Schiller
,
yet
he
brawls
in
taverns
and
plucks
out
the
beards
of
his
boon
*NL*
companions
.
Oh
,
he
,
too
,
can
be
good
and
noble
,
but
only
when
all
goes
*NL*
well
with
him
.
What
is
more
,
he
can
be
carried
off
his
feet
,
positively
*NL*
carried
off
his
feet
by
noble
ideals
,
but
only
if
they
come
of
themselves
,
*NL*
if
they
fall
from
heaven
for
him
,
if
they
need
not
be
paid
for
.
He
*NL*
dislikes
paying
for
anything
,
but
is
very
fond
of
receiving
,
and
that
's
so
*NL*
with
him
in
everything
.
Oh
,
give
him
every
possible
good
in
life
-LRB-
he
*NL*
could
n't
be
content
with
less
-RRB-
,
and
put
no
obstacle
in
his
way
,
and
he
*NL*
will
show
that
he
,
too
,
can
be
noble
.
He
is
not
greedy
,
no
,
but
he
must
*NL*
have
money
,
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
you
will
see
how
generously
,
with
*NL*
what
scorn
of
filthy
lucre
,
he
will
fling
it
all
away
in
the
reckless
*NL*
dissipation
of
one
night
.
But
if
he
has
not
money
,
he
will
show
what
he
is
*NL*
ready
to
do
to
get
it
when
he
is
in
great
need
of
it
.
But
all
this
later
,
*NL*
let
us
take
events
in
their
chronological
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
we
have
before
us
a
poor
abandoned
child
,
running
about
the
back
-
*NL*
yard
`
without
boots
on
his
feet
,
'
as
our
worthy
and
esteemed
fellow
*NL*
citizen
,
of
foreign
origin
,
alas
!
expressed
it
just
now
.
I
repeat
it
*NL*
again
,
I
yield
to
no
one
the
defense
of
the
criminal
.
I
am
here
to
accuse
*NL*
him
,
but
to
defend
him
also
.
Yes
,
I
,
too
,
am
human
;
I
,
too
,
can
weigh
the
*NL*
influence
of
home
and
childhood
on
the
character
.
But
the
boy
grows
up
and
*NL*
becomes
an
officer
;
for
a
duel
and
other
reckless
conduct
he
is
exiled
to
*NL*
one
of
the
remote
frontier
towns
of
Russia
.
There
he
led
a
wild
life
as
an
*NL*
officer
.
And
,
of
course
,
he
needed
money
,
money
before
all
things
,
and
so
*NL*
after
prolonged
disputes
he
came
to
a
settlement
with
his
father
,
and
the
*NL*
last
six
thousand
was
sent
him
.
A
letter
is
in
existence
in
which
he
*NL*
practically
gives
up
his
claim
to
the
rest
and
settles
his
conflict
with
*NL*
his
father
over
the
inheritance
on
the
payment
of
this
six
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
came
his
meeting
with
a
young
girl
of
lofty
character
and
brilliant
*NL*
education
.
Oh
,
I
do
not
venture
to
repeat
the
details
;
you
have
only
just
*NL*
heard
them
.
Honor
,
self-sacrifice
were
shown
there
,
and
I
will
be
silent
.
*NL*
The
figure
of
the
young
officer
,
frivolous
and
profligate
,
doing
homage
to
*NL*
true
nobility
and
a
lofty
ideal
,
was
shown
in
a
very
sympathetic
light
*NL*
before
us
.
But
the
other
side
of
the
medal
was
unexpectedly
turned
to
us
*NL*
immediately
after
in
this
very
court
.
Again
I
will
not
venture
to
*NL*
conjecture
why
it
happened
so
,
but
there
were
causes
.
The
same
lady
,
*NL*
bathed
in
tears
of
long-concealed
indignation
,
alleged
that
he
,
he
of
all
*NL*
men
,
had
despised
her
for
her
action
,
which
,
though
incautious
,
reckless
*NL*
perhaps
,
was
still
dictated
by
lofty
and
generous
motives
.
He
,
he
,
the
*NL*
girl
's
betrothed
,
looked
at
her
with
that
smile
of
mockery
,
which
was
more
*NL*
insufferable
from
him
than
from
any
one
.
And
knowing
that
he
had
already
*NL*
deceived
her
-LRB-
he
had
deceived
her
,
believing
that
she
was
bound
to
endure
*NL*
everything
from
him
,
even
treachery
-RRB-
,
she
intentionally
offered
him
three
*NL*
thousand
roubles
,
and
clearly
,
too
clearly
,
let
him
understand
that
she
*NL*
was
offering
him
money
to
deceive
her
.
`
Well
,
will
you
take
it
or
not
,
are
*NL*
you
so
lost
to
shame
?
'
was
the
dumb
question
in
her
scrutinizing
eyes
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
her
,
saw
clearly
what
was
in
her
mind
-LRB-
he
's
admitted
here
before
*NL*
you
that
he
understood
it
all
-RRB-
,
appropriated
that
three
thousand
*NL*
unconditionally
,
and
squandered
it
in
two
days
with
the
new
object
of
his
*NL*
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
believe
then
?
The
first
legend
of
the
young
officer
*NL*
sacrificing
his
last
farthing
in
a
noble
impulse
of
generosity
and
doing
*NL*
reverence
to
virtue
,
or
this
other
revolting
picture
?
As
a
rule
,
between
*NL*
two
extremes
one
has
to
find
the
mean
,
but
in
the
present
case
this
is
not
*NL*
true
.
The
probability
is
that
in
the
first
case
he
was
genuinely
noble
,
*NL*
and
in
the
second
as
genuinely
base
.
And
why
?
Because
he
was
of
the
broad
*NL*
Karamazov
character
--
that
's
just
what
I
am
leading
up
to
--
capable
of
*NL*
combining
the
most
incongruous
contradictions
,
and
capable
of
the
greatest
*NL*
heights
and
of
the
greatest
depths
.
Remember
the
brilliant
remark
made
by
*NL*
a
young
observer
who
has
seen
the
Karamazov
family
at
close
quarters
--
Mr.
*NL*
Rakitin
:
`
The
sense
of
their
own
degradation
is
as
essential
to
those
*NL*
reckless
,
unbridled
natures
as
the
sense
of
their
lofty
generosity
.
'
And
*NL*
that
's
true
,
they
need
continually
this
unnatural
mixture
.
Two
extremes
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
,
or
they
are
miserable
and
dissatisfied
and
their
*NL*
existence
is
incomplete
.
They
are
wide
,
wide
as
mother
Russia
;
they
*NL*
include
everything
and
put
up
with
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
we
've
just
touched
upon
that
three
*NL*
thousand
roubles
,
and
I
will
venture
to
anticipate
things
a
little
.
Can
*NL*
you
conceive
that
a
man
like
that
,
on
receiving
that
sum
and
in
such
a
*NL*
way
,
at
the
price
of
such
shame
,
such
disgrace
,
such
utter
degradation
,
*NL*
could
have
been
capable
that
very
day
of
setting
apart
half
that
sum
,
that
*NL*
very
day
,
and
sewing
it
up
in
a
little
bag
,
and
would
have
had
the
*NL*
firmness
of
character
to
carry
it
about
with
him
for
a
whole
month
*NL*
afterwards
,
in
spite
of
every
temptation
and
his
extreme
need
of
it
!
*NL*
Neither
in
drunken
debauchery
in
taverns
,
nor
when
he
was
flying
into
the
*NL*
country
,
trying
to
get
from
God
knows
whom
,
the
money
so
essential
to
him
*NL*
to
remove
the
object
of
his
affections
from
being
tempted
by
his
father
,
*NL*
did
he
bring
himself
to
touch
that
little
bag
!
Why
,
if
only
to
avoid
*NL*
abandoning
his
mistress
to
the
rival
of
whom
he
was
so
jealous
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
certain
to
have
opened
that
bag
and
to
have
stayed
at
home
to
*NL*
keep
watch
over
her
,
and
to
await
the
moment
when
she
would
say
to
him
at
*NL*
last
'
I
am
yours
,
'
and
to
fly
with
her
far
from
their
fatal
surroundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
,
he
did
not
touch
his
talisman
,
and
what
is
the
reason
he
gives
*NL*
for
it
?
The
chief
reason
,
as
I
have
just
said
,
was
that
when
she
would
*NL*
say
,
'
I
am
yours
,
take
me
where
you
will
,
'
he
might
have
the
wherewithal
*NL*
to
take
her
.
But
that
first
reason
,
in
the
prisoner
's
own
words
,
was
of
*NL*
little
weight
beside
the
second
.
While
I
have
that
money
on
me
,
he
said
,
I
*NL*
am
a
scoundrel
,
not
a
thief
,
for
I
can
always
go
to
my
insulted
betrothed
,
*NL*
and
,
laying
down
half
the
sum
I
have
fraudulently
appropriated
,
I
can
*NL*
always
say
to
her
,
`
You
see
,
I
've
squandered
half
your
money
,
and
shown
I
*NL*
am
a
weak
and
immoral
man
,
and
,
if
you
like
,
a
scoundrel
'
-LRB-
I
use
the
*NL*
prisoner
's
own
expressions
-RRB-
,
`
but
though
I
am
a
scoundrel
,
I
am
not
a
*NL*
thief
,
for
if
I
had
been
a
thief
,
I
should
n't
have
brought
you
back
this
*NL*
half
of
the
money
,
but
should
have
taken
it
as
I
did
the
other
half
!
'
A
*NL*
marvelous
explanation
!
This
frantic
,
but
weak
man
,
who
could
not
resist
*NL*
the
temptation
of
accepting
the
three
thousand
roubles
at
the
price
of
*NL*
such
disgrace
,
this
very
man
suddenly
develops
the
most
stoical
firmness
,
*NL*
and
carries
about
a
thousand
roubles
without
daring
to
touch
it
.
Does
that
*NL*
fit
in
at
all
with
the
character
we
have
analyzed
?
No
,
and
I
venture
to
*NL*
tell
you
how
the
real
Dmitri
Karamazov
would
have
behaved
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
,
if
he
really
had
brought
himself
to
put
away
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
first
temptation
--
for
instance
,
to
entertain
the
woman
with
whom
he
*NL*
had
already
squandered
half
the
money
--
he
would
have
unpicked
his
little
*NL*
bag
and
have
taken
out
some
hundred
roubles
,
for
why
should
he
have
taken
*NL*
back
precisely
half
the
money
,
that
is
,
fifteen
hundred
roubles
?
why
not
*NL*
fourteen
hundred
?
He
could
just
as
well
have
said
then
that
he
was
not
a
*NL*
thief
,
because
he
brought
back
fourteen
hundred
roubles
.
Then
another
time
*NL*
he
would
have
unpicked
it
again
and
taken
out
another
hundred
,
and
then
a
*NL*
third
,
and
then
a
fourth
,
and
before
the
end
of
the
month
he
would
have
*NL*
taken
the
last
note
but
one
,
feeling
that
if
he
took
back
only
a
hundred
*NL*
it
would
answer
the
purpose
,
for
a
thief
would
have
stolen
it
all
.
And
*NL*
then
he
would
have
looked
at
this
last
note
,
and
have
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
`
It
's
really
not
worth
while
to
give
back
one
hundred
;
let
's
spend
that
,
*NL*
too
!
'
That
's
how
the
real
Dmitri
Karamazov
,
as
we
know
him
,
would
have
*NL*
behaved
.
One
can
not
imagine
anything
more
incongruous
with
the
actual
fact
*NL*
than
this
legend
of
the
little
bag
.
Nothing
could
be
more
inconceivable
.
*NL*
But
we
shall
return
to
that
later

After

Ippolit

passed
to
the
evidence
of

fixed
idea
about
the
three
thousand
owing

Chapter
VII
.
An
Historical
Survey
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
medical
experts
have
striven
to
convince
us
that
the
prisoner
is
out
*NL*
of
his
mind
and
,
in
fact
,
a
maniac
.
I
maintain
that
he
is
in
his
right
*NL*
mind
,
and
that
if
he
had
not
been
,
he
would
have
behaved
more
cleverly
.
As
*NL*
for
his
being
a
maniac
,
that
I
would
agree
with
,
but
only
in
one
point
,
*NL*
that
is
,
his
fixed
idea
about
the
three
thousand
.
Yet
I
think
one
might
*NL*
find
a
much
simpler
cause
than
his
tendency
to
insanity
.
For
my
part
I
*NL*
agree
thoroughly
with
the
young
doctor
who
maintained
that
the
prisoner
's
*NL*
mental
faculties
have
always
been
normal
,
and
that
he
has
only
been
*NL*
irritable
and
exasperated
.
The
object
of
the
prisoner
's
continual
and
*NL*
violent
anger
was
not
the
sum
itself
;
there
was
a
special
motive
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
it
.
That
motive
is
jealousy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
described
at
length
the
prisoner
's
fatal
passion
*NL*
for
Grushenka
.
He
began
from
the
moment
when
the
prisoner
went
to
the
*NL*
``
young
person
's
''
lodgings
``
to
beat
her
''
--
``
I
use
his
own
expression
,
''
the
*NL*
prosecutor
explained
--
``
but
instead
of
beating
her
,
he
remained
there
,
at
*NL*
her
feet
.
That
was
the
beginning
of
the
passion
.
At
the
same
time
the
*NL*
prisoner
's
father
was
captivated
by
the
same
young
person
--
a
strange
and
*NL*
fatal
coincidence
,
for
they
both
lost
their
hearts
to
her
simultaneously
,
*NL*
though
both
had
known
her
before
.
And
she
inspired
in
both
of
them
the
*NL*
most
violent
,
characteristically
Karamazov
passion
.
We
have
her
own
*NL*
confession
:
'
I
was
laughing
at
both
of
them
.
'
Yes
,
the
sudden
desire
to
*NL*
make
a
jest
of
them
came
over
her
,
and
she
conquered
both
of
them
at
once
.
*NL*
The
old
man
,
who
worshiped
money
,
at
once
set
aside
three
thousand
roubles
*NL*
as
a
reward
for
one
visit
from
her
,
but
soon
after
that
,
he
would
have
*NL*
been
happy
to
lay
his
property
and
his
name
at
her
feet
,
if
only
she
would
*NL*
become
his
lawful
wife
.
We
have
good
evidence
of
this
.
As
for
the
*NL*
prisoner
,
the
tragedy
of
his
fate
is
evident
;
it
is
before
us
.
But
such
*NL*
was
the
young
person
's
`
game
.
'
The
enchantress
gave
the
unhappy
young
man
*NL*
no
hope
until
the
last
moment
,
when
he
knelt
before
her
,
stretching
out
*NL*
hands
that
were
already
stained
with
the
blood
of
his
father
and
rival
.
It
*NL*
was
in
that
position
that
he
was
arrested
.
`
Send
me
to
Siberia
with
him
,
I
*NL*
have
brought
him
to
this
,
I
am
most
to
blame
,
'
the
woman
herself
cried
,
in
*NL*
genuine
remorse
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
talented
young
man
,
to
whom
I
have
referred
already
,
Mr.
Rakitin
,
*NL*
characterized
this
heroine
in
brief
and
impressive
terms
:
`
She
was
*NL*
disillusioned
early
in
life
,
deceived
and
ruined
by
a
betrothed
,
who
*NL*
seduced
and
abandoned
her
.
She
was
left
in
poverty
,
cursed
by
her
*NL*
respectable
family
,
and
taken
under
the
protection
of
a
wealthy
old
man
,
*NL*
whom
she
still
,
however
,
considers
as
her
benefactor
.
There
was
perhaps
*NL*
much
that
was
good
in
her
young
heart
,
but
it
was
embittered
too
early
.
*NL*
She
became
prudent
and
saved
money
.
She
grew
sarcastic
and
resentful
*NL*
against
society
.
'
After
this
sketch
of
her
character
it
may
well
be
*NL*
understood
that
she
might
laugh
at
both
of
them
simply
from
mischief
,
from
*NL*
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
a
month
of
hopeless
love
and
moral
degradation
,
during
which
he
*NL*
betrayed
his
betrothed
and
appropriated
money
entrusted
to
his
honor
,
the
*NL*
prisoner
was
driven
almost
to
frenzy
,
almost
to
madness
by
continual
*NL*
jealousy
--
and
of
whom
?
His
father
!
And
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
crazy
*NL*
old
man
was
alluring
and
enticing
the
object
of
his
affection
by
means
of
*NL*
that
very
three
thousand
roubles
,
which
the
son
looked
upon
as
his
own
*NL*
property
,
part
of
his
inheritance
from
his
mother
,
of
which
his
father
was
*NL*
cheating
him
.
Yes
,
I
admit
it
was
hard
to
bear
!
It
might
well
drive
a
man
*NL*
to
madness
.
It
was
not
the
money
,
but
the
fact
that
this
money
was
used
*NL*
with
such
revolting
cynicism
to
ruin
his
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
prosecutor
went
on
to
describe
how
the
idea
of
murdering
his
*NL*
father
had
entered
the
prisoner
's
head
,
and
illustrated
his
theory
with
*NL*
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
first
he
only
talked
about
it
in
taverns
--
he
was
talking
about
it
all
*NL*
that
month
.
Ah
,
he
likes
being
always
surrounded
with
company
,
and
he
*NL*
likes
to
tell
his
companions
everything
,
even
his
most
diabolical
and
*NL*
dangerous
ideas
;
he
likes
to
share
every
thought
with
others
,
and
expects
,
*NL*
for
some
reason
,
that
those
he
confides
in
will
meet
him
with
perfect
*NL*
sympathy
,
enter
into
all
his
troubles
and
anxieties
,
take
his
part
and
not
*NL*
oppose
him
in
anything
.
If
not
,
he
flies
into
a
rage
and
smashes
up
*NL*
everything
in
the
tavern
.
-LSB-
Then
followed
the
anecdote
about
Captain
*NL*
Snegiryov
.
-RSB-
Those
who
heard
the
prisoner
began
to
think
at
last
that
he
*NL*
might
mean
more
than
threats
,
and
that
such
a
frenzy
might
turn
threats
*NL*
into
actions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
prosecutor
described
the
meeting
of
the
family
at
the
monastery
,
*NL*
the
conversations
with
Alyosha
,
and
the
horrible
scene
of
violence
when
*NL*
the
prisoner
had
rushed
into
his
father
's
house
just
after
dinner
.

*NL*
``
I
can
not
positively
assert
,
''
the
prosecutor
continued
,
``
that
the
prisoner
*NL*
fully
intended
to
murder
his
father
before
that
incident
.
Yet
the
idea
had
*NL*
several
times
presented
itself
to
him
,
and
he
had
deliberated
on
it
--
for
*NL*
that
we
have
facts
,
witnesses
,
and
his
own
words
.
I
confess
,
gentlemen
of
*NL*
the
jury
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
till
to-day
I
have
been
uncertain
whether
to
*NL*
attribute
to
the
prisoner
conscious
premeditation
.
I
was
firmly
convinced
*NL*
that
he
had
pictured
the
fatal
moment
beforehand
,
but
had
only
pictured
*NL*
it
,
contemplating
it
as
a
possibility
.
He
had
not
definitely
considered
*NL*
when
and
how
he
might
commit
the
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
was
only
uncertain
till
to-day
,
till
that
fatal
document
was
*NL*
presented
to
the
court
just
now
.
You
yourselves
heard
that
young
lady
's
*NL*
exclamation
,
`
It
is
the
plan
,
the
program
of
the
murder
!
'
That
is
how
she
*NL*
defined
that
miserable
,
drunken
letter
of
the
unhappy
prisoner
.
And
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
from
that
letter
we
see
that
the
whole
fact
of
the
murder
was
*NL*
premeditated
.
It
was
written
two
days
before
,
and
so
we
know
now
for
a
*NL*
fact
that
,
forty-eight
hours
before
the
perpetration
of
his
terrible
*NL*
design
,
the
prisoner
swore
that
,
if
he
could
not
get
money
next
day
,
he
*NL*
would
murder
his
father
in
order
to
take
the
envelope
with
the
notes
from
*NL*
under
his
pillow
,
as
soon
as
Ivan
had
left
.
`
As
soon
as
Ivan
had
gone
*NL*
away
'
--
you
hear
that
;
so
he
had
thought
everything
out
,
weighing
every
*NL*
circumstance
,
and
he
carried
it
all
out
just
as
he
had
written
it
.
The
*NL*
proof
of
premeditation
is
conclusive
;
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
the
money
,
that
is
stated
clearly
,
that
is
written
and
*NL*
signed
.
The
prisoner
does
not
deny
his
signature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
told
he
was
drunk
when
he
wrote
it
.
But
that
does
not
diminish
*NL*
the
value
of
the
letter
,
quite
the
contrary
;
he
wrote
when
drunk
what
he
*NL*
had
planned
when
sober
.
Had
he
not
planned
it
when
sober
,
he
would
not
*NL*
have
written
it
when
drunk
.
I
shall
be
asked
:
Then
why
did
he
talk
about
*NL*
it
in
taverns
?
A
man
who
premeditates
such
a
crime
is
silent
and
keeps
it
*NL*
to
himself
.
Yes
,
but
he
talked
about
it
before
he
had
formed
a
plan
,
when
*NL*
he
had
only
the
desire
,
only
the
impulse
to
it
.
Afterwards
he
talked
less
*NL*
about
it
.
On
the
evening
he
wrote
that
letter
at
the
`
Metropolis
'
tavern
,
*NL*
contrary
to
his
custom
he
was
silent
,
though
he
had
been
drinking
.
He
did
*NL*
not
play
billiards
,
he
sat
in
a
corner
,
talked
to
no
one
.
He
did
indeed
*NL*
turn
a
shopman
out
of
his
seat
,
but
that
was
done
almost
unconsciously
,
*NL*
because
he
could
never
enter
a
tavern
without
making
a
disturbance
.
It
is
*NL*
true
that
after
he
had
taken
the
final
decision
,
he
must
have
felt
*NL*
apprehensive
that
he
had
talked
too
much
about
his
design
beforehand
,
and
*NL*
that
this
might
lead
to
his
arrest
and
prosecution
afterwards
.
But
there
*NL*
was
nothing
for
it
;
he
could
not
take
his
words
back
,
but
his
luck
had
*NL*
served
him
before
,
it
would
serve
him
again
.
He
believed
in
his
star
,
you
*NL*
know
!
I
must
confess
,
too
,
that
he
did
a
great
deal
to
avoid
the
fatal
*NL*
catastrophe
.
`
To-morrow
I
shall
try
and
borrow
the
money
from
every
one
,
'
*NL*
as
he
writes
in
his
peculiar
language
,
`
and
if
they
wo
n't
give
it
to
me
,
*NL*
there
will
be
bloodshed
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
passed
to
a
detailed
description
of
all
Mitya
's
*NL*
efforts
to
borrow
the
money
.
He
described
his
visit
to
Samsonov
,
his
*NL*
journey
to
Lyagavy
.
``
Harassed
,
jeered
at
,
hungry
,
after
selling
his
watch
*NL*
to
pay
for
the
journey
-LRB-
though
he
tells
us
he
had
fifteen
hundred
roubles
*NL*
on
him
--
a
likely
story
-RRB-
,
tortured
by
jealousy
at
having
left
the
object
of
*NL*
his
affections
in
the
town
,
suspecting
that
she
would
go
to
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
in
his
absence
,
he
returned
at
last
to
the
town
,
to
find
,
to
*NL*
his
joy
,
that
she
had
not
been
near
his
father
.
He
accompanied
her
himself
*NL*
to
her
protector
.
-LRB-
Strange
to
say
,
he
does
n't
seem
to
have
been
jealous
of
*NL*
Samsonov
,
which
is
psychologically
interesting
.
-RRB-
Then
he
hastens
back
to
*NL*
his
ambush
in
the
back
gardens
,
and
there
learns
that
Smerdyakov
is
in
a
*NL*
fit
,
that
the
other
servant
is
ill
--
the
coast
is
clear
and
he
knows
the
*NL*
`
signals
'
--
what
a
temptation
!
Still
he
resists
it
;
he
goes
off
to
a
lady
*NL*
who
has
for
some
time
been
residing
in
the
town
,
and
who
is
highly
*NL*
esteemed
among
us
,
Madame
Hohlakov
.
That
lady
,
who
had
long
watched
his
*NL*
career
with
compassion
,
gave
him
the
most
judicious
advice
,
to
give
up
his
*NL*
dissipated
life
,
his
unseemly
love-affair
,
the
waste
of
his
youth
and
*NL*
vigor
in
pot-house
debauchery
,
and
to
set
off
to
Siberia
to
the
gold
-
*NL*
mines
:
`
that
would
be
an
outlet
for
your
turbulent
energies
,
your
romantic
*NL*
character
,
your
thirst
for
adventure
.

*NL*
*NL*
After
describing
the
result
of
this
conversation
and
the
moment
when
the
*NL*
prisoner
learnt
that
Grushenka
had
not
remained
at
Samsonov
's
,
the
sudden
*NL*
frenzy
of
the
luckless
man
worn
out
with
jealousy
and
nervous
exhaustion
,
*NL*
at
the
thought
that
she
had
deceived
him
and
was
now
with
his
father
,
*NL*
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
concluded
by
dwelling
upon
the
fatal
influence
of
*NL*
chance
.
``
Had
the
maid
told
him
that
her
mistress
was
at
Mokroe
with
her
*NL*
former
lover
,
nothing
would
have
happened
.
But
she
lost
her
head
,
she
*NL*
could
only
swear
and
protest
her
ignorance
,
and
if
the
prisoner
did
not
*NL*
kill
her
on
the
spot
,
it
was
only
because
he
flew
in
pursuit
of
his
false
*NL*
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
note
,
frantic
as
he
was
,
he
took
with
him
a
brass
pestle
.
Why
that
?
*NL*
Why
not
some
other
weapon
?
But
since
he
had
been
contemplating
his
plan
*NL*
and
preparing
himself
for
it
for
a
whole
month
,
he
would
snatch
up
*NL*
anything
like
a
weapon
that
caught
his
eye
.
He
had
realized
for
a
month
*NL*
past
that
any
object
of
the
kind
would
serve
as
a
weapon
,
so
he
instantly
,
*NL*
without
hesitation
,
recognized
that
it
would
serve
his
purpose
.
So
it
was
*NL*
by
no
means
unconsciously
,
by
no
means
involuntarily
,
that
he
snatched
up
*NL*
that
fatal
pestle
.
And
then
we
find
him
in
his
father
's
garden
--
the
coast
*NL*
is
clear
,
there
are
no
witnesses
,
darkness
and
jealousy
.
The
suspicion
*NL*
that
she
was
there
,
with
him
,
with
his
rival
,
in
his
arms
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
laughing
at
him
at
that
moment
--
took
his
breath
away
.
And
it
was
not
mere
*NL*
suspicion
,
the
deception
was
open
,
obvious
.
She
must
be
there
,
in
that
*NL*
lighted
room
,
she
must
be
behind
the
screen
;
and
the
unhappy
man
would
*NL*
have
us
believe
that
he
stole
up
to
the
window
,
peeped
respectfully
in
,
*NL*
and
discreetly
withdrew
,
for
fear
something
terrible
and
immoral
should
*NL*
happen
.
And
he
tries
to
persuade
us
of
that
,
us
,
who
understand
his
*NL*
character
,
who
know
his
state
of
mind
at
the
moment
,
and
that
he
knew
the
*NL*
signals
by
which
he
could
at
once
enter
the
house
.
''
At
this
point
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
broke
off
to
discuss
exhaustively
the
suspected
connection
of
*NL*
Smerdyakov
with
the
murder
.
He
did
this
very
circumstantially
,
and
every
*NL*
one
realized
that
,
although
he
professed
to
despise
that
suspicion
,
he
*NL*
thought
the
subject
of
great
importance

*NL*
``
To
begin
with
,
what
was
the
source
of
this
suspicion
?
''
-LRB-
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
began
.
-RRB-
``
The
first
person
who
cried
out
that
Smerdyakov
had
*NL*
committed
the
murder
was
the
prisoner
himself
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
,
*NL*
yet
from
that
time
to
this
he
had
not
brought
forward
a
single
fact
to
*NL*
confirm
the
charge
,
nor
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
fact
.
The
charge
is
*NL*
confirmed
by
three
persons
only
--
the
two
brothers
of
the
prisoner
and
*NL*
Madame
Svyetlov
.
The
elder
of
these
brothers
expressed
his
suspicions
only
*NL*
to-day
,
when
he
was
undoubtedly
suffering
from
brain
fever
.
But
we
know
*NL*
that
for
the
last
two
months
he
has
completely
shared
our
conviction
of
*NL*
his
brother
's
guilt
and
did
not
attempt
to
combat
that
idea
.
But
of
that
*NL*
later
.
The
younger
brother
has
admitted
that
he
has
not
the
slightest
fact
*NL*
to
support
his
notion
of
Smerdyakov
's
guilt
,
and
has
only
been
led
to
that
*NL*
conclusion
from
the
prisoner
's
own
words
and
the
expression
of
his
face
.
*NL*
Yes
,
that
astounding
piece
of
evidence
has
been
brought
forward
twice
to
-
*NL*
day
by
him
.
Madame
Svyetlov
was
even
more
astounding
.
`
What
the
prisoner
*NL*
tells
you
,
you
must
believe
;
he
is
not
a
man
to
tell
a
lie
.
'
That
is
all
*NL*
the
evidence
against
Smerdyakov
produced
by
these
three
persons
,
who
are
*NL*
all
deeply
concerned
in
the
prisoner
's
fate
.
And
yet
the
theory
of
*NL*
Smerdyakov
's
guilt
has
been
noised
about
,
has
been
and
is
still
*NL*
maintained
.
Is
it
credible
?
Is
it
conceivable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
thought
it
necessary
to
describe
the
personality
*NL*
of
Smerdyakov
,
``
who
had
cut
short
his
life
in
a
fit
of
insanity
.
''
He
*NL*
depicted
him
as
a
man
of
weak
intellect
,
with
a
smattering
of
education
,
*NL*
who
had
been
thrown
off
his
balance
by
philosophical
ideas
above
his
level
*NL*
and
certain
modern
theories
of
duty
,
which
he
learnt
in
practice
from
the
*NL*
reckless
life
of
his
master
,
who
was
also
perhaps
his
father
--
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
;
and
,
theoretically
,
from
various
strange
philosophical
*NL*
conversations
with
his
master
's
elder
son
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
who
readily
*NL*
indulged
in
this
diversion
,
probably
feeling
dull
or
wishing
to
amuse
*NL*
himself
at
the
valet
's
expense
.
``
He
spoke
to
me
himself
of
his
spiritual
*NL*
condition
during
the
last
few
days
at
his
father
's
house
,
''
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
explained
;
``
but
others
too
have
borne
witness
to
it
--
the
*NL*
prisoner
himself
,
his
brother
,
and
the
servant
Grigory
--
that
is
,
all
who
*NL*
knew
him
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moreover
,
Smerdyakov
,
whose
health
was
shaken
by
his
attacks
of
epilepsy
,
*NL*
had
not
the
courage
of
a
chicken
.
`
He
fell
at
my
feet
and
kissed
them
,
'
*NL*
the
prisoner
himself
has
told
us
,
before
he
realized
how
damaging
such
a
*NL*
statement
was
to
himself
.
`
He
is
an
epileptic
chicken
,
'
he
declared
about
*NL*
him
in
his
characteristic
language
.
And
the
prisoner
chose
him
for
his
*NL*
confidant
-LRB-
we
have
his
own
word
for
it
-RRB-
and
he
frightened
him
into
*NL*
consenting
at
last
to
act
as
a
spy
for
him
.
In
that
capacity
he
deceived
*NL*
his
master
,
revealing
to
the
prisoner
the
existence
of
the
envelope
with
*NL*
the
notes
in
it
and
the
signals
by
means
of
which
he
could
get
into
the
*NL*
house
.
How
could
he
help
telling
him
,
indeed
?
`
He
would
have
killed
me
,
I
*NL*
could
see
that
he
would
have
killed
me
,
'
he
said
at
the
inquiry
,
trembling
*NL*
and
shaking
even
before
us
,
though
his
tormentor
was
by
that
time
arrested
*NL*
and
could
do
him
no
harm
.
`
He
suspected
me
at
every
instant
.
In
fear
and
*NL*
trembling
I
hastened
to
tell
him
every
secret
to
pacify
him
,
that
he
might
*NL*
see
that
I
had
not
deceived
him
and
let
me
off
alive
.
'
Those
are
his
own
*NL*
words
.
I
wrote
them
down
and
I
remember
them
.
`
When
he
began
shouting
at
*NL*
me
,
I
would
fall
on
my
knees
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
naturally
very
honest
and
enjoyed
the
complete
confidence
of
his
*NL*
master
,
ever
since
he
had
restored
him
some
money
he
had
lost
.
So
it
may
*NL*
be
supposed
that
the
poor
fellow
suffered
pangs
of
remorse
at
having
*NL*
deceived
his
master
,
whom
he
loved
as
his
benefactor
.
Persons
severely
*NL*
afflicted
with
epilepsy
are
,
so
the
most
skillful
doctors
tell
us
,
always
*NL*
prone
to
continual
and
morbid
self-reproach
.
They
worry
over
their
*NL*
`
wickedness
,
'
they
are
tormented
by
pangs
of
conscience
,
often
entirely
*NL*
without
cause
;
they
exaggerate
and
often
invent
all
sorts
of
faults
and
*NL*
crimes
.
And
here
we
have
a
man
of
that
type
who
had
really
been
driven
to
*NL*
wrong-doing
by
terror
and
intimidation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
,
besides
,
a
strong
presentiment
that
something
terrible
would
be
*NL*
the
outcome
of
the
situation
that
was
developing
before
his
eyes
.
When
*NL*
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
was
leaving
for
Moscow
,
just
before
the
catastrophe
,
*NL*
Smerdyakov
besought
him
to
remain
,
though
he
was
too
timid
to
tell
him
*NL*
plainly
what
he
feared
.
He
confined
himself
to
hints
,
but
his
hints
were
*NL*
not
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
observed
that
he
looked
on
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
as
a
protector
,
*NL*
whose
presence
in
the
house
was
a
guarantee
that
no
harm
would
come
to
*NL*
pass
.
Remember
the
phrase
in
Dmitri
Karamazov
's
drunken
letter
,
'
I
shall
*NL*
kill
the
old
man
,
if
only
Ivan
goes
away
.
'
So
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
's
presence
*NL*
seemed
to
every
one
a
guarantee
of
peace
and
order
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
went
away
,
and
within
an
hour
of
his
young
master
's
departure
*NL*
Smerdyakov
was
taken
with
an
epileptic
fit
.
But
that
's
perfectly
*NL*
intelligible
.
Here
I
must
mention
that
Smerdyakov
,
oppressed
by
terror
and
*NL*
despair
of
a
sort
,
had
felt
during
those
last
few
days
that
one
of
the
*NL*
fits
from
which
he
had
suffered
before
at
moments
of
strain
,
might
be
*NL*
coming
upon
him
again
.
The
day
and
hour
of
such
an
attack
can
not
,
of
*NL*
course
,
be
foreseen
,
but
every
epileptic
can
feel
beforehand
that
he
is
*NL*
likely
to
have
one
.
So
the
doctors
tell
us
.
And
so
,
as
soon
as
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
had
driven
out
of
the
yard
,
Smerdyakov
,
depressed
by
his
*NL*
lonely
and
unprotected
position
,
went
to
the
cellar
.
He
went
down
the
*NL*
stairs
wondering
if
he
would
have
a
fit
or
not
,
and
what
if
it
were
to
*NL*
come
upon
him
at
once
.
And
that
very
apprehension
,
that
very
wonder
,
*NL*
brought
on
the
spasm
in
his
throat
that
always
precedes
such
attacks
,
and
*NL*
he
fell
unconscious
into
the
cellar
.
And
in
this
perfectly
natural
*NL*
occurrence
people
try
to
detect
a
suspicion
,
a
hint
that
he
was
shamming
*NL*
an
attack
_
on
purpose
_
.
But
,
if
it
were
on
purpose
,
the
question
arises
at
*NL*
once
,
what
was
his
motive
?
What
was
he
reckoning
on
?
What
was
he
aiming
*NL*
at
?
I
say
nothing
about
medicine
:
science
,
I
am
told
,
may
go
astray
:
the
*NL*
doctors
were
not
able
to
discriminate
between
the
counterfeit
and
the
*NL*
real
.
That
may
be
so
,
but
answer
me
one
question
:
what
motive
had
he
for
*NL*
such
a
counterfeit
?
Could
he
,
had
he
been
plotting
the
murder
,
have
*NL*
desired
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
household
by
having
a
fit
just
*NL*
before
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
on
the
night
of
the
murder
,
there
were
*NL*
five
persons
in
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
's
--
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
himself
-LRB-
but
he
did
*NL*
not
kill
himself
,
that
's
evident
-RRB-
;
then
his
servant
,
Grigory
,
but
he
was
*NL*
almost
killed
himself
;
the
third
person
was
Grigory
's
wife
,
Marfa
*NL*
Ignatyevna
,
but
it
would
be
simply
shameful
to
imagine
her
murdering
her
*NL*
master
.
Two
persons
are
left
--
the
prisoner
and
Smerdyakov
.
But
,
if
we
are
*NL*
to
believe
the
prisoner
's
statement
that
he
is
not
the
murderer
,
then
*NL*
Smerdyakov
must
have
been
,
for
there
is
no
other
alternative
,
no
one
else
*NL*
can
be
found
.
That
is
what
accounts
for
the
artful
,
astounding
accusation
*NL*
against
the
unhappy
idiot
who
committed
suicide
yesterday
.
Had
a
shadow
of
*NL*
suspicion
rested
on
any
one
else
,
had
there
been
any
sixth
person
,
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
that
even
the
prisoner
would
have
been
ashamed
to
accuse
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
and
would
have
accused
that
sixth
person
,
for
to
charge
*NL*
Smerdyakov
with
that
murder
is
perfectly
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
let
us
lay
aside
psychology
,
let
us
lay
aside
medicine
,
let
us
*NL*
even
lay
aside
logic
,
let
us
turn
only
to
the
facts
and
see
what
the
facts
*NL*
tell
us
.
If
Smerdyakov
killed
him
,
how
did
he
do
it
?
Alone
or
with
the
*NL*
assistance
of
the
prisoner
?
Let
us
consider
the
first
alternative
--
that
he
*NL*
did
it
alone
.
If
he
had
killed
him
it
must
have
been
with
some
object
,
for
*NL*
some
advantage
to
himself
.
But
not
having
a
shadow
of
the
motive
that
the
*NL*
prisoner
had
for
the
murder
--
hatred
,
jealousy
,
and
so
on
--
Smerdyakov
could
*NL*
only
have
murdered
him
for
the
sake
of
gain
,
in
order
to
appropriate
the
*NL*
three
thousand
roubles
he
had
seen
his
master
put
in
the
envelope
.
And
yet
*NL*
he
tells
another
person
--
and
a
person
most
closely
interested
,
that
is
,
the
*NL*
prisoner
--
everything
about
the
money
and
the
signals
,
where
the
envelope
*NL*
lay
,
what
was
written
on
it
,
what
it
was
tied
up
with
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
told
him
of
those
signals
by
which
he
could
enter
the
house
.
Did
he
do
*NL*
this
simply
to
betray
himself
,
or
to
invite
to
the
same
enterprise
one
who
*NL*
would
be
anxious
to
get
that
envelope
for
himself
?
`
Yes
,
'
I
shall
be
told
,
*NL*
`
but
he
betrayed
it
from
fear
.
'
But
how
do
you
explain
this
?
A
man
who
*NL*
could
conceive
such
an
audacious
,
savage
act
,
and
carry
it
out
,
tells
*NL*
facts
which
are
known
to
no
one
else
in
the
world
,
and
which
,
if
he
held
*NL*
his
tongue
,
no
one
would
ever
have
guessed
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
however
cowardly
he
might
be
,
if
he
had
plotted
such
a
crime
,
nothing
*NL*
would
have
induced
him
to
tell
any
one
about
the
envelope
and
the
signals
,
*NL*
for
that
was
as
good
as
betraying
himself
beforehand
.
He
would
have
*NL*
invented
something
,
he
would
have
told
some
lie
if
he
had
been
forced
to
*NL*
give
information
,
but
he
would
have
been
silent
about
that
.
For
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
if
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
money
,
but
had
committed
the
*NL*
murder
and
stolen
the
money
,
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
charged
him
*NL*
with
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
,
since
no
one
but
he
had
seen
the
*NL*
money
,
no
one
but
he
knew
of
its
existence
in
the
house
.
Even
if
he
had
*NL*
been
accused
of
the
murder
,
it
could
only
have
been
thought
that
he
had
*NL*
committed
it
from
some
other
motive
.
But
since
no
one
had
observed
any
*NL*
such
motive
in
him
beforehand
,
and
every
one
saw
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
*NL*
his
master
was
fond
of
him
and
honored
him
with
his
confidence
,
he
would
,
*NL*
of
course
,
have
been
the
last
to
be
suspected
.
People
would
have
suspected
*NL*
first
the
man
who
had
a
motive
,
a
man
who
had
himself
declared
he
had
such
*NL*
motives
,
who
had
made
no
secret
of
it
;
they
would
,
in
fact
,
have
suspected
*NL*
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
,
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
.
Had
Smerdyakov
killed
*NL*
and
robbed
him
,
and
the
son
been
accused
of
it
,
that
would
,
of
course
,
*NL*
have
suited
Smerdyakov
.
Yet
are
we
to
believe
that
,
though
plotting
the
*NL*
murder
,
he
told
that
son
,
Dmitri
,
about
the
money
,
the
envelope
,
and
the
*NL*
signals
?
Is
that
logical
?
Is
that
clear
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
day
of
the
murder
planned
by
Smerdyakov
came
,
we
have
him
*NL*
falling
downstairs
in
a
_
feigned
_
fit
--
with
what
object
?
In
the
first
place
*NL*
that
Grigory
,
who
had
been
intending
to
take
his
medicine
,
might
put
it
*NL*
off
and
remain
on
guard
,
seeing
there
was
no
one
to
look
after
the
house
,
*NL*
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
I
suppose
,
that
his
master
seeing
that
there
was
*NL*
no
one
to
guard
him
,
and
in
terror
of
a
visit
from
his
son
,
might
redouble
*NL*
his
vigilance
and
precaution
.
And
,
most
of
all
,
I
suppose
that
he
,
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
disabled
by
the
fit
,
might
be
carried
from
the
kitchen
,
where
*NL*
he
always
slept
,
apart
from
all
the
rest
,
and
where
he
could
go
in
and
out
*NL*
as
he
liked
,
to
Grigory
's
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
lodge
,
where
he
was
*NL*
always
put
,
shut
off
by
a
screen
three
paces
from
their
own
bed
.
This
was
*NL*
the
immemorial
custom
established
by
his
master
and
the
kind-hearted
Marfa
*NL*
Ignatyevna
,
whenever
he
had
a
fit
.
There
,
lying
behind
the
screen
,
he
*NL*
would
most
likely
,
to
keep
up
the
sham
,
have
begun
groaning
,
and
so
*NL*
keeping
them
awake
all
night
-LRB-
as
Grigory
and
his
wife
testified
-RRB-
.
And
all
*NL*
this
,
we
are
to
believe
,
that
he
might
more
conveniently
get
up
and
murder
*NL*
his
master
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
be
told
that
he
shammed
illness
on
purpose
that
he
might
not
*NL*
be
suspected
and
that
he
told
the
prisoner
of
the
money
and
the
signals
to
*NL*
tempt
him
to
commit
the
murder
,
and
when
he
had
murdered
him
and
had
gone
*NL*
away
with
the
money
,
making
a
noise
,
most
likely
,
and
waking
people
,
*NL*
Smerdyakov
got
up
,
am
I
to
believe
,
and
went
in
--
what
for
?
To
murder
his
*NL*
master
a
second
time
and
carry
off
the
money
that
had
already
been
stolen
?
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
are
you
laughing
?
I
am
ashamed
to
put
forward
such
suggestions
,
*NL*
but
,
incredible
as
it
seems
,
that
's
just
what
the
prisoner
alleges
.
When
*NL*
he
had
left
the
house
,
had
knocked
Grigory
down
and
raised
an
alarm
,
he
*NL*
tells
us
Smerdyakov
got
up
,
went
in
and
murdered
his
master
and
stole
the
*NL*
money
!
I
wo
n't
press
the
point
that
Smerdyakov
could
hardly
have
reckoned
*NL*
on
this
beforehand
,
and
have
foreseen
that
the
furious
and
exasperated
son
*NL*
would
simply
come
to
peep
in
respectfully
,
though
he
knew
the
signals
,
and
*NL*
beat
a
retreat
,
leaving
Smerdyakov
his
booty
.
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
I
put
*NL*
this
question
to
you
in
earnest
;
when
was
the
moment
when
Smerdyakov
could
*NL*
have
committed
his
crime
?
Name
that
moment
,
or
you
ca
n't
accuse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
perhaps
,
the
fit
was
a
real
one
,
the
sick
man
suddenly
recovered
,
*NL*
heard
a
shout
,
and
went
out
.
Well
--
what
then
?
He
looked
about
him
and
said
,
*NL*
`
Why
not
go
and
kill
the
master
?
'
And
how
did
he
know
what
had
happened
,
*NL*
since
he
had
been
lying
unconscious
till
that
moment
?
But
there
's
a
limit
*NL*
to
these
flights
of
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Quite
so
,
'
some
astute
people
will
tell
me
,
`
but
what
if
they
were
in
*NL*
agreement
?
What
if
they
murdered
him
together
and
shared
the
money
--
what
*NL*
then
?
'
A
weighty
question
,
truly
!
And
the
facts
to
confirm
it
are
*NL*
astounding
.
One
commits
the
murder
and
takes
all
the
trouble
while
his
*NL*
accomplice
lies
on
one
side
shamming
a
fit
,
apparently
to
arouse
suspicion
*NL*
in
every
one
,
alarm
in
his
master
and
alarm
in
Grigory
.
It
would
be
*NL*
interesting
to
know
what
motives
could
have
induced
the
two
accomplices
to
*NL*
form
such
an
insane
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
it
was
not
a
case
of
active
complicity
on
Smerdyakov
's
part
,
*NL*
but
only
of
passive
acquiescence
;
perhaps
Smerdyakov
was
intimidated
and
*NL*
agreed
not
to
prevent
the
murder
,
and
foreseeing
that
he
would
be
blamed
*NL*
for
letting
his
master
be
murdered
,
without
screaming
for
help
or
*NL*
resisting
,
he
may
have
obtained
permission
from
Dmitri
Karamazov
to
get
*NL*
out
of
the
way
by
shamming
a
fit
--
`
you
may
murder
him
as
you
like
;
it
's
*NL*
nothing
to
me
.
'
But
as
this
attack
of
Smerdyakov
's
was
bound
to
throw
the
*NL*
household
into
confusion
,
Dmitri
Karamazov
could
never
have
agreed
to
such
*NL*
a
plan
.
I
will
waive
that
point
however
.
Supposing
that
he
did
agree
,
it
*NL*
would
still
follow
that
Dmitri
Karamazov
is
the
murderer
and
the
*NL*
instigator
,
and
Smerdyakov
is
only
a
passive
accomplice
,
and
not
even
an
*NL*
accomplice
,
but
merely
acquiesced
against
his
will
through
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
we
see
?
As
soon
as
he
is
arrested
the
prisoner
instantly
*NL*
throws
all
the
blame
on
Smerdyakov
,
not
accusing
him
of
being
his
*NL*
accomplice
,
but
of
being
himself
the
murderer
.
`
He
did
it
alone
,
'
he
says
.
*NL*
`
He
murdered
and
robbed
him
.
It
was
the
work
of
his
hands
.
'
Strange
sort
*NL*
of
accomplices
who
begin
to
accuse
one
another
at
once
!
And
think
of
the
*NL*
risk
for
Karamazov
.
After
committing
the
murder
while
his
accomplice
lay
*NL*
in
bed
,
he
throws
the
blame
on
the
invalid
,
who
might
well
have
resented
*NL*
it
and
in
self-preservation
might
well
have
confessed
the
truth
.
For
he
*NL*
might
well
have
seen
that
the
court
would
at
once
judge
how
far
he
was
*NL*
responsible
,
and
so
he
might
well
have
reckoned
that
if
he
were
punished
,
*NL*
it
would
be
far
less
severely
than
the
real
murderer
.
But
in
that
case
he
*NL*
would
have
been
certain
to
make
a
confession
,
yet
he
has
not
done
so
.
*NL*
Smerdyakov
never
hinted
at
their
complicity
,
though
the
actual
murderer
*NL*
persisted
in
accusing
him
and
declaring
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
more
,
Smerdyakov
at
the
inquiry
volunteered
the
statement
that
it
*NL*
was
_
he
_
who
had
told
the
prisoner
of
the
envelope
of
notes
and
of
the
*NL*
signals
,
and
that
,
but
for
him
,
he
would
have
known
nothing
about
them
.
If
*NL*
he
had
really
been
a
guilty
accomplice
,
would
he
so
readily
have
made
this
*NL*
statement
at
the
inquiry
?
On
the
contrary
,
he
would
have
tried
to
conceal
*NL*
it
,
to
distort
the
facts
or
minimize
them
.
But
he
was
far
from
distorting
*NL*
or
minimizing
them
.
No
one
but
an
innocent
man
,
who
had
no
fear
of
being
*NL*
charged
with
complicity
,
could
have
acted
as
he
did
.
And
in
a
fit
of
*NL*
melancholy
arising
from
his
disease
and
this
catastrophe
he
hanged
himself
*NL*
yesterday
.
He
left
a
note
written
in
his
peculiar
language
,
'
I
destroy
*NL*
myself
of
my
own
will
and
inclination
so
as
to
throw
no
blame
on
any
one
.
'
*NL*
What
would
it
have
cost
him
to
add
:
'
I
am
the
murderer
,
not
Karamazov
'
?
*NL*
But
that
he
did
not
add
.
Did
his
conscience
lead
him
to
suicide
and
not
to
*NL*
avowing
his
guilt
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
followed
?
Notes
for
three
thousand
roubles
were
brought
into
the
*NL*
court
just
now
,
and
we
were
told
that
they
were
the
same
that
lay
in
the
*NL*
envelope
now
on
the
table
before
us
,
and
that
the
witness
had
received
*NL*
them
from
Smerdyakov
the
day
before
.
But
I
need
not
recall
the
painful
*NL*
scene
,
though
I
will
make
one
or
two
comments
,
selecting
such
trivial
ones
*NL*
as
might
not
be
obvious
at
first
sight
to
every
one
,
and
so
may
be
*NL*
overlooked
.
In
the
first
place
,
Smerdyakov
must
have
given
back
the
money
*NL*
and
hanged
himself
yesterday
from
remorse
.
And
only
yesterday
he
confessed
*NL*
his
guilt
to
Ivan
Karamazov
,
as
the
latter
informs
us
.
If
it
were
not
so
,
*NL*
indeed
,
why
should
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
have
kept
silence
till
now
?
And
so
,
*NL*
if
he
has
confessed
,
then
why
,
I
ask
again
,
did
he
not
avow
the
whole
*NL*
truth
in
the
last
letter
he
left
behind
,
knowing
that
the
innocent
*NL*
prisoner
had
to
face
this
terrible
ordeal
the
next
day
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
money
alone
is
no
proof
.
A
week
ago
,
quite
by
chance
,
the
fact
came
*NL*
to
the
knowledge
of
myself
and
two
other
persons
in
this
court
that
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
had
sent
two
five
per
cent
.
coupons
of
five
thousand
*NL*
each
--
that
is
,
ten
thousand
in
all
--
to
the
chief
town
of
the
province
to
be
*NL*
changed
.
I
only
mention
this
to
point
out
that
any
one
may
have
money
,
and
*NL*
that
it
ca
n't
be
proved
that
these
notes
are
the
same
as
were
in
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
Karamazov
,
after
receiving
yesterday
a
communication
of
such
*NL*
importance
from
the
real
murderer
,
did
not
stir
.
Why
did
n't
he
report
it
*NL*
at
once
?
Why
did
he
put
it
all
off
till
morning
?
I
think
I
have
a
right
to
*NL*
conjecture
why
.
His
health
had
been
giving
way
for
a
week
past
:
he
had
*NL*
admitted
to
a
doctor
and
to
his
most
intimate
friends
that
he
was
*NL*
suffering
from
hallucinations
and
seeing
phantoms
of
the
dead
:
he
was
on
*NL*
the
eve
of
the
attack
of
brain
fever
by
which
he
has
been
stricken
down
*NL*
to-day
.
In
this
condition
he
suddenly
heard
of
Smerdyakov
's
death
,
and
at
*NL*
once
reflected
,
`
The
man
is
dead
,
I
can
throw
the
blame
on
him
and
save
my
*NL*
brother
.
I
have
money
.
I
will
take
a
roll
of
notes
and
say
that
Smerdyakov
*NL*
gave
them
me
before
his
death
.
'
You
will
say
that
was
dishonorable
:
it
's
*NL*
dishonorable
to
slander
even
the
dead
,
and
even
to
save
a
brother
.
True
,
*NL*
but
what
if
he
slandered
him
unconsciously
?
What
if
,
finally
unhinged
by
*NL*
the
sudden
news
of
the
valet
's
death
,
he
imagined
it
really
was
so
?
You
*NL*
saw
the
recent
scene
:
you
have
seen
the
witness
's
condition
.
He
was
*NL*
standing
up
and
was
speaking
,
but
where
was
his
mind
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
followed
the
document
,
the
prisoner
's
letter
written
two
days
before
*NL*
the
crime
,
and
containing
a
complete
program
of
the
murder
.
Why
,
then
,
are
*NL*
we
looking
for
any
other
program
?
The
crime
was
committed
precisely
*NL*
according
to
this
program
,
and
by
no
other
than
the
writer
of
it
.
Yes
,
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
it
went
off
without
a
hitch
!
He
did
not
run
*NL*
respectfully
and
timidly
away
from
his
father
's
window
,
though
he
was
*NL*
firmly
convinced
that
the
object
of
his
affections
was
with
him
.
No
,
that
*NL*
is
absurd
and
unlikely
!
He
went
in
and
murdered
him
.
Most
likely
he
killed
*NL*
him
in
anger
,
burning
with
resentment
,
as
soon
as
he
looked
on
his
hated
*NL*
rival
.
But
having
killed
him
,
probably
with
one
blow
of
the
brass
pestle
,
*NL*
and
having
convinced
himself
,
after
careful
search
,
that
she
was
not
*NL*
there
,
he
did
not
,
however
,
forget
to
put
his
hand
under
the
pillow
and
*NL*
take
out
the
envelope
,
the
torn
cover
of
which
lies
now
on
the
table
*NL*
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mention
this
fact
that
you
may
note
one
,
to
my
thinking
,
very
*NL*
characteristic
circumstance
.
Had
he
been
an
experienced
murderer
and
had
*NL*
he
committed
the
murder
for
the
sake
of
gain
only
,
would
he
have
left
the
*NL*
torn
envelope
on
the
floor
as
it
was
found
,
beside
the
corpse
?
Had
it
been
*NL*
Smerdyakov
,
for
instance
,
murdering
his
master
to
rob
him
,
he
would
have
*NL*
simply
carried
away
the
envelope
with
him
,
without
troubling
himself
to
*NL*
open
it
over
his
victim
's
corpse
,
for
he
would
have
known
for
certain
that
*NL*
the
notes
were
in
the
envelope
--
they
had
been
put
in
and
sealed
up
in
his
*NL*
presence
--
and
had
he
taken
the
envelope
with
him
,
no
one
would
ever
have
*NL*
known
of
the
robbery
.
I
ask
you
,
gentlemen
,
would
Smerdyakov
have
behaved
*NL*
in
that
way
?
Would
he
have
left
the
envelope
on
the
floor
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
this
was
the
action
of
a
frantic
murderer
,
a
murderer
who
was
not
a
*NL*
thief
and
had
never
stolen
before
that
day
,
who
snatched
the
notes
from
*NL*
under
the
pillow
,
not
like
a
thief
stealing
them
,
but
as
though
seizing
*NL*
his
own
property
from
the
thief
who
had
stolen
it
.
For
that
was
the
idea
*NL*
which
had
become
almost
an
insane
obsession
in
Dmitri
Karamazov
in
regard
*NL*
to
that
money
.
And
pouncing
upon
the
envelope
,
which
he
had
never
seen
*NL*
before
,
he
tore
it
open
to
make
sure
whether
the
money
was
in
it
,
and
ran
*NL*
away
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
,
even
forgetting
to
consider
that
he
had
*NL*
left
an
astounding
piece
of
evidence
against
himself
in
that
torn
envelope
*NL*
on
the
floor
.
All
because
it
was
Karamazov
,
not
Smerdyakov
,
he
did
n't
*NL*
think
,
he
did
n't
reflect
,
and
how
should
he
?
He
ran
away
;
he
heard
behind
*NL*
him
the
servant
cry
out
;
the
old
man
caught
him
,
stopped
him
and
was
*NL*
felled
to
the
ground
by
the
brass
pestle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prisoner
,
moved
by
pity
,
leapt
down
to
look
at
him
.
Would
you
believe
*NL*
it
,
he
tells
us
that
he
leapt
down
out
of
pity
,
out
of
compassion
,
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
could
do
anything
for
him
.
Was
that
a
moment
to
show
*NL*
compassion
?
No
;
he
jumped
down
simply
to
make
certain
whether
the
only
*NL*
witness
of
his
crime
were
dead
or
alive
.
Any
other
feeling
,
any
other
*NL*
motive
would
be
unnatural
.
Note
that
he
took
trouble
over
Grigory
,
wiped
*NL*
his
head
with
his
handkerchief
and
,
convincing
himself
he
was
dead
,
he
ran
*NL*
to
the
house
of
his
mistress
,
dazed
and
covered
with
blood
.
How
was
it
he
*NL*
never
thought
that
he
was
covered
with
blood
and
would
be
at
once
*NL*
detected
?
But
the
prisoner
himself
assures
us
that
he
did
not
even
notice
*NL*
that
he
was
covered
with
blood
.
That
may
be
believed
,
that
is
very
*NL*
possible
,
that
always
happens
at
such
moments
with
criminals
.
On
one
point
*NL*
they
will
show
diabolical
cunning
,
while
another
will
escape
them
*NL*
altogether
.
But
he
was
thinking
at
that
moment
of
one
thing
only
--
where
was
*NL*
_
she
_
?
He
wanted
to
find
out
at
once
where
she
was
,
so
he
ran
to
her
*NL*
lodging
and
learnt
an
unexpected
and
astounding
piece
of
news
--
she
had
gone
*NL*
off
to
Mokroe
to
meet
her
first
lover

Chapter
IX

The
Galloping
Troika
.
The
End
Of
The
Prosecutor
's
Speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
had
chosen
the
historical
method
of
exposition
,
*NL*
beloved
by
all
nervous
orators
,
who
find
in
its
limitation
a
check
on
*NL*
their
own
eager
rhetoric
.
At
this
moment
in
his
speech
he
went
off
into
a
*NL*
dissertation
on
Grushenka
's
``
first
lover
,
''
and
brought
forward
several
*NL*
interesting
thoughts
on
this
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Karamazov
,
who
had
been
frantically
jealous
of
every
one
,
collapsed
,
so
*NL*
to
speak
,
and
effaced
himself
at
once
before
this
first
lover
.
What
makes
*NL*
it
all
the
more
strange
is
that
he
seems
to
have
hardly
thought
of
this
*NL*
formidable
rival
.
But
he
had
looked
upon
him
as
a
remote
danger
,
and
*NL*
Karamazov
always
lives
in
the
present
.
Possibly
he
regarded
him
as
a
*NL*
fiction
.
But
his
wounded
heart
grasped
instantly
that
the
woman
had
been
*NL*
concealing
this
new
rival
and
deceiving
him
,
because
he
was
anything
but
a
*NL*
fiction
to
her
,
because
he
was
the
one
hope
of
her
life
.
Grasping
this
*NL*
instantly
,
he
resigned
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
I
can
not
help
dwelling
on
this
unexpected
trait
in
*NL*
the
prisoner
's
character
.
He
suddenly
evinces
an
irresistible
desire
for
*NL*
justice
,
a
respect
for
woman
and
a
recognition
of
her
right
to
love
.
And
*NL*
all
this
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
stained
his
hands
with
his
*NL*
father
's
blood
for
her
sake
!
It
is
true
that
the
blood
he
had
shed
was
*NL*
already
crying
out
for
vengeance
,
for
,
after
having
ruined
his
soul
and
*NL*
his
life
in
this
world
,
he
was
forced
to
ask
himself
at
that
same
instant
*NL*
what
he
was
and
what
he
could
be
now
to
her
,
to
that
being
,
dearer
to
him
*NL*
than
his
own
soul
,
in
comparison
with
that
former
lover
who
had
returned
*NL*
penitent
,
with
new
love
,
to
the
woman
he
had
once
betrayed
,
with
honorable
*NL*
offers
,
with
the
promise
of
a
reformed
and
happy
life
.
And
he
,
luckless
*NL*
man
,
what
could
he
give
her
now
,
what
could
he
offer
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Karamazov
felt
all
this
,
knew
that
all
ways
were
barred
to
him
by
his
*NL*
crime
and
that
he
was
a
criminal
under
sentence
,
and
not
a
man
with
life
*NL*
before
him
!
This
thought
crushed
him
.
And
so
he
instantly
flew
to
one
*NL*
frantic
plan
,
which
,
to
a
man
of
Karamazov
's
character
,
must
have
appeared
*NL*
the
one
inevitable
way
out
of
his
terrible
position
.
That
way
out
was
*NL*
suicide
.
He
ran
for
the
pistols
he
had
left
in
pledge
with
his
friend
*NL*
Perhotin
and
on
the
way
,
as
he
ran
,
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
the
money
,
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
stained
his
hands
with
his
father
's
gore
.
Oh
,
*NL*
now
he
needed
money
more
than
ever
.
Karamazov
would
die
,
Karamazov
would
*NL*
shoot
himself
and
it
should
be
remembered
!
To
be
sure
,
he
was
a
poet
and
*NL*
had
burnt
the
candle
at
both
ends
all
his
life
.
`
To
her
,
to
her
!
and
*NL*
there
,
oh
,
there
I
will
give
a
feast
to
the
whole
world
,
such
as
never
was
*NL*
before
,
that
will
be
remembered
and
talked
of
long
after
!
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
shouts
of
wild
merriment
,
reckless
gypsy
songs
and
dances
I
shall
raise
*NL*
the
glass
and
drink
to
the
woman
I
adore
and
her
new-found
happiness
!
And
*NL*
then
,
on
the
spot
,
at
her
feet
,
I
shall
dash
out
my
brains
before
her
and
*NL*
punish
myself
!
She
will
remember
Mitya
Karamazov
sometimes
,
she
will
see
*NL*
how
Mitya
loved
her
,
she
will
feel
for
Mitya
!

*NL*
``
Here
we
see
in
excess
a
love
of
effect
,
a
romantic
despair
and
*NL*
sentimentality

and
the
wild
recklessness
of
the
Karamazovs
.
Yes
,
but
*NL*
there
is
something
else

gentlemen
of
the

something
that
cries
out
*NL*
in
the
soul

throbs
incessantly
in

poisons
the
heart
unto
*NL*
death

that

something
_
is
conscience

its
judgment

*NL*
its
terrible
torments

The

will
settle
everything

pistol
is
*NL*
the
only
way
out

But
_
beyond
_

I
do
n't
know
whether
Karamazov
wondered
at
*NL*
that
moment
`
What
lies
beyond

and
whether
Karamazov
could
,
like
Hamlet

*NL*
wonder
`
What
lies
beyond

No

,
*NL*
hinted
at
it
,
all
but
spoke
out
.
''
-LRB-
Then
followed
the
evidence
given
by
*NL*
witnesses
.
-RRB-
``
He
even
cried
out
to
the
peasant
who
drove
him
,
`
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
you
are
driving
a
murderer
!
'
But
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
speak
out
,
*NL*
he
had
to
get
to
Mokroe
and
there
to
finish
his
romance
.
But
what
was
*NL*
awaiting
the
luckless
man
?
Almost
from
the
first
minute
at
Mokroe
he
saw
*NL*
that
his
invincible
rival
was
perhaps
by
no
means
so
invincible
,
that
the
*NL*
toast
to
their
new-found
happiness
was
not
desired
and
would
not
be
*NL*
acceptable
.
But
you
know
the
facts
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
from
the
*NL*
preliminary
inquiry
.
Karamazov
's
triumph
over
his
rival
was
complete
and
*NL*
his
soul
passed
into
quite
a
new
phase
,
perhaps
the
most
terrible
phase
*NL*
through
which
his
soul
has
passed
or
will
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
may
say
with
certainty
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
''
the
prosecutor
*NL*
continued
,
``
that
outraged
nature
and
the
criminal
heart
bring
their
own
*NL*
vengeance
more
completely
than
any
earthly
justice
.
What
's
more
,
justice
*NL*
and
punishment
on
earth
positively
alleviate
the
punishment
of
nature
and
*NL*
are
,
indeed
,
essential
to
the
soul
of
the
criminal
at
such
moments
,
as
its
*NL*
salvation
from
despair
.
For
I
can
not
imagine
the
horror
and
moral
*NL*
suffering
of
Karamazov
when
he
learnt
that
she
loved
him
,
that
for
his
*NL*
sake
she
had
rejected
her
first
lover
,
that
she
was
summoning
him
,
Mitya
,
*NL*
to
a
new
life
,
that
she
was
promising
him
happiness
--
and
when
?
When
*NL*
everything
was
over
for
him
and
nothing
was
possible
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
I
will
note
in
parenthesis
a
point
of
importance
for
the
*NL*
light
it
throws
on
the
prisoner
's
position
at
the
moment
.
This
woman
,
this
*NL*
love
of
his
,
had
been
till
the
last
moment
,
till
the
very
instant
of
his
*NL*
arrest
,
a
being
unattainable
,
passionately
desired
by
him
but
*NL*
unattainable
.
Yet
why
did
he
not
shoot
himself
then
,
why
did
he
relinquish
*NL*
his
design
and
even
forget
where
his
pistol
was
?
It
was
just
that
*NL*
passionate
desire
for
love
and
the
hope
of
satisfying
it
that
restrained
*NL*
him
.
Throughout
their
revels
he
kept
close
to
his
adored
mistress
,
who
was
*NL*
at
the
banquet
with
him
and
was
more
charming
and
fascinating
to
him
than
*NL*
ever
--
he
did
not
leave
her
side
,
abasing
himself
in
his
homage
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
passion
might
well
,
for
a
moment
,
stifle
not
only
the
fear
of
arrest
,
*NL*
but
even
the
torments
of
conscience
.
For
a
moment
,
oh
,
only
for
a
moment
!
*NL*
I
can
picture
the
state
of
mind
of
the
criminal
hopelessly
enslaved
by
*NL*
these
influences
--
first
,
the
influence
of
drink
,
of
noise
and
excitement
,
*NL*
of
the
thud
of
the
dance
and
the
scream
of
the
song
,
and
of
her
,
flushed
*NL*
with
wine
,
singing
and
dancing
and
laughing
to
him
!
Secondly
,
the
hope
in
*NL*
the
background
that
the
fatal
end
might
still
be
far
off
,
that
not
till
*NL*
next
morning
,
at
least
,
they
would
come
and
take
him
.
So
he
had
a
few
*NL*
hours
and
that
's
much
,
very
much
!
In
a
few
hours
one
can
think
of
many
*NL*
things
.
I
imagine
that
he
felt
something
like
what
criminals
feel
when
*NL*
they
are
being
taken
to
the
scaffold
.
They
have
another
long
,
long
street
*NL*
to
pass
down
and
at
walking
pace
,
past
thousands
of
people
.
Then
there
*NL*
will
be
a
turning
into
another
street
and
only
at
the
end
of
that
street
*NL*
the
dread
place
of
execution
!
I
fancy
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
*NL*
the
condemned
man
,
sitting
on
his
shameful
cart
,
must
feel
that
he
has
*NL*
infinite
life
still
before
him
.
The
houses
recede
,
the
cart
moves
on
--
oh
,
*NL*
that
's
nothing
,
it
's
still
far
to
the
turning
into
the
second
street
and
*NL*
he
still
looks
boldly
to
right
and
to
left
at
those
thousands
of
callously
*NL*
curious
people
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
him
,
and
he
still
fancies
that
he
*NL*
is
just
such
a
man
as
they
.
But
now
the
turning
comes
to
the
next
street
.
*NL*
Oh
,
that
's
nothing
,
nothing
,
there
's
still
a
whole
street
before
him
,
and
*NL*
however
many
houses
have
been
passed
,
he
will
still
think
there
are
many
*NL*
left
.
And
so
to
the
very
end
,
to
the
very
scaffold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
I
imagine
is
how
it
was
with
Karamazov
then
.
`
They
've
not
had
time
*NL*
yet
,
'
he
must
have
thought
,
'
I
may
still
find
some
way
out
,
oh
,
there
's
*NL*
still
time
to
make
some
plan
of
defense
,
and
now
,
now
--
she
is
so
*NL*
fascinating
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
soul
was
full
of
confusion
and
dread
,
but
he
managed
,
however
,
to
put
*NL*
aside
half
his
money
and
hide
it
somewhere
--
I
can
not
otherwise
explain
the
*NL*
disappearance
of
quite
half
of
the
three
thousand
he
had
just
taken
from
*NL*
his
father
's
pillow
.
He
had
been
in
Mokroe
more
than
once
before
,
he
had
*NL*
caroused
there
for
two
days
together
already
,
he
knew
the
old
big
house
*NL*
with
all
its
passages
and
outbuildings
.
I
imagine
that
part
of
the
money
*NL*
was
hidden
in
that
house
,
not
long
before
the
arrest
,
in
some
crevice
,
*NL*
under
some
floor
,
in
some
corner
,
under
the
roof
.
With
what
object
?
I
*NL*
shall
be
asked
.
Why
,
the
catastrophe
may
take
place
at
once
,
of
course
;
he
*NL*
had
n't
yet
considered
how
to
meet
it
,
he
had
n't
the
time
,
his
head
was
*NL*
throbbing
and
his
heart
was
with
_
her
_
,
but
money
--
money
was
indispensable
*NL*
in
any
case
!
With
money
a
man
is
always
a
man
.
Perhaps
such
foresight
at
*NL*
such
a
moment
may
strike
you
as
unnatural
?
But
he
assures
us
himself
that
*NL*
a
month
before
,
at
a
critical
and
exciting
moment
,
he
had
halved
his
money
*NL*
and
sewn
it
up
in
a
little
bag
.
And
though
that
was
not
true
,
as
we
shall
*NL*
prove
directly
,
it
shows
the
idea
was
a
familiar
one
to
Karamazov
,
he
had
*NL*
contemplated
it
.
What
's
more
,
when
he
declared
at
the
inquiry
that
he
had
*NL*
put
fifteen
hundred
roubles
in
a
bag
-LRB-
which
never
existed
-RRB-
he
may
have
*NL*
invented
that
little
bag
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
,
because
he
had
*NL*
two
hours
before
divided
his
money
and
hidden
half
of
it
at
Mokroe
till
*NL*
morning
,
in
case
of
emergency
,
simply
not
to
have
it
on
himself
.
Two
*NL*
extremes
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
remember
that
Karamazov
can
contemplate
*NL*
two
extremes
and
both
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
looked
in
the
house
,
but
we
have
n't
found
the
money
.
It
may
still
*NL*
be
there
or
it
may
have
disappeared
next
day
and
be
in
the
prisoner
's
*NL*
hands
now
.
In
any
case
he
was
at
her
side
,
on
his
knees
before
her
,
she
*NL*
was
lying
on
the
bed
,
he
had
his
hands
stretched
out
to
her
and
he
had
so
*NL*
entirely
forgotten
everything
that
he
did
not
even
hear
the
men
coming
to
*NL*
arrest
him
.
He
had
n't
time
to
prepare
any
line
of
defense
in
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
was
caught
unawares
and
confronted
with
his
judges
,
the
arbiters
of
his
*NL*
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
there
are
moments
in
the
execution
of
our
duties
*NL*
when
it
is
terrible
for
us
to
face
a
man
,
terrible
on
his
account
,
too
!
*NL*
The
moments
of
contemplating
that
animal
fear
,
when
the
criminal
sees
that
*NL*
all
is
lost
,
but
still
struggles
,
still
means
to
struggle
,
the
moments
*NL*
when
every
instinct
of
self-preservation
rises
up
in
him
at
once
and
he
*NL*
looks
at
you
with
questioning
and
suffering
eyes
,
studies
you
,
your
face
,
*NL*
your
thoughts
,
uncertain
on
which
side
you
will
strike
,
and
his
distracted
*NL*
mind
frames
thousands
of
plans
in
an
instant
,
but
he
is
still
afraid
to
*NL*
speak
,
afraid
of
giving
himself
away
!
This
purgatory
of
the
spirit
,
this
*NL*
animal
thirst
for
self-preservation
,
these
humiliating
moments
of
the
*NL*
human
soul
,
are
awful
,
and
sometimes
arouse
horror
and
compassion
for
the
*NL*
criminal
even
in
the
lawyer
.
And
this
was
what
we
all
witnessed
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
first
he
was
thunderstruck
and
in
his
terror
dropped
some
very
*NL*
compromising
phrases
.
`
Blood
!
I
've
deserved
it
!
'
But
he
quickly
restrained
*NL*
himself
.
He
had
not
prepared
what
he
was
to
say
,
what
answer
he
was
to
*NL*
make
,
he
had
nothing
but
a
bare
denial
ready
.
'
I
am
not
guilty
of
my
*NL*
father
's
death
.
'
That
was
his
fence
for
the
moment
and
behind
it
he
hoped
*NL*
to
throw
up
a
barricade
of
some
sort
.
His
first
compromising
exclamations
*NL*
he
hastened
to
explain
by
declaring
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
death
*NL*
of
the
servant
Grigory
only
.
`
Of
that
bloodshed
I
am
guilty
,
but
who
has
*NL*
killed
my
father
,
gentlemen
,
who
has
killed
him
?
Who
can
have
killed
him
,
*NL*
_
if
not
I
_
?
'
Do
you
hear
,
he
asked
us
that
,
us
,
who
had
come
to
ask
him
*NL*
that
question
!
Do
you
hear
that
phrase
uttered
with
such
premature
*NL*
haste
--
`
if
not
I
'
--
the
animal
cunning
,
the
naivete
,
the
Karamazov
impatience
*NL*
of
it
?
'
I
did
n't
kill
him
and
you
must
n't
think
I
did
!
I
wanted
to
kill
*NL*
him
,
gentlemen
,
I
wanted
to
kill
him
,
'
he
hastens
to
admit
-LRB-
he
was
in
a
*NL*
hurry
,
in
a
terrible
hurry
-RRB-
,
`
but
still
I
am
not
guilty
,
it
is
not
I
*NL*
murdered
him
.
'
He
concedes
to
us
that
he
wanted
to
murder
him
,
as
though
*NL*
to
say
,
you
can
see
for
yourselves
how
truthful
I
am
,
so
you
'll
believe
*NL*
all
the
sooner
that
I
did
n't
murder
him
.
Oh
,
in
such
cases
the
criminal
is
*NL*
often
amazingly
shallow
and
credulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
that
point
one
of
the
lawyers
asked
him
,
as
it
were
incidentally
,
the
*NL*
most
simple
question
,
`
Was
n't
it
Smerdyakov
killed
him
?
'
Then
,
as
we
*NL*
expected
,
he
was
horribly
angry
at
our
having
anticipated
him
and
caught
*NL*
him
unawares
,
before
he
had
time
to
pave
the
way
to
choose
and
snatch
the
*NL*
moment
when
it
would
be
most
natural
to
bring
in
Smerdyakov
's
name
.
He
*NL*
rushed
at
once
to
the
other
extreme
,
as
he
always
does
,
and
began
to
*NL*
assure
us
that
Smerdyakov
could
not
have
killed
him
,
was
not
capable
of
*NL*
it
.
But
do
n't
believe
him
,
that
was
only
his
cunning
;
he
did
n't
really
*NL*
give
up
the
idea
of
Smerdyakov
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
meant
to
bring
him
*NL*
forward
again
;
for
,
indeed
,
he
had
no
one
else
to
bring
forward
,
but
he
*NL*
would
do
that
later
,
because
for
the
moment
that
line
was
spoiled
for
him
.
*NL*
He
would
bring
him
forward
perhaps
next
day
,
or
even
a
few
days
later
,
*NL*
choosing
an
opportunity
to
cry
out
to
us
,
`
You
know
I
was
more
skeptical
*NL*
about
Smerdyakov
than
you
,
you
remember
that
yourselves
,
but
now
I
am
*NL*
convinced
.
He
killed
him
,
he
must
have
done
!
'
And
for
the
present
he
falls
*NL*
back
upon
a
gloomy
and
irritable
denial
.
Impatience
and
anger
prompted
*NL*
him
,
however
,
to
the
most
inept
and
incredible
explanation
of
how
he
*NL*
looked
into
his
father
's
window
and
how
he
respectfully
withdrew
.
The
*NL*
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
position
of
affairs
,
of
the
*NL*
evidence
given
by
Grigory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
proceeded
to
search
him
.
The
search
angered
,
but
encouraged
him
,
the
*NL*
whole
three
thousand
had
not
been
found
on
him
,
only
half
of
it
.
And
no
*NL*
doubt
only
at
that
moment
of
angry
silence
,
the
fiction
of
the
little
bag
*NL*
first
occurred
to
him
.
No
doubt
he
was
conscious
himself
of
the
*NL*
improbability
of
the
story
and
strove
painfully
to
make
it
sound
more
*NL*
likely
,
to
weave
it
into
a
romance
that
would
sound
plausible
.
In
such
*NL*
cases
the
first
duty
,
the
chief
task
of
the
investigating
lawyers
,
is
to
*NL*
prevent
the
criminal
being
prepared
,
to
pounce
upon
him
unexpectedly
so
*NL*
that
he
may
blurt
out
his
cherished
ideas
in
all
their
simplicity
,
*NL*
improbability
and
inconsistency
.
The
criminal
can
only
be
made
to
speak
by
*NL*
the
sudden
and
apparently
incidental
communication
of
some
new
fact
,
of
*NL*
some
circumstance
of
great
importance
in
the
case
,
of
which
he
had
no
*NL*
previous
idea
and
could
not
have
foreseen
.
We
had
such
a
fact
in
*NL*
readiness
--
that
was
Grigory
's
evidence
about
the
open
door
through
which
*NL*
the
prisoner
had
run
out
.
He
had
completely
forgotten
about
that
door
and
*NL*
had
not
even
suspected
that
Grigory
could
have
seen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
effect
of
it
was
amazing
.
He
leapt
up
and
shouted
to
us
,
`
Then
*NL*
Smerdyakov
murdered
him
,
it
was
Smerdyakov
!
'
and
so
betrayed
the
basis
of
*NL*
the
defense
he
was
keeping
back
,
and
betrayed
it
in
its
most
improbable
*NL*
shape
,
for
Smerdyakov
could
only
have
committed
the
murder
after
he
had
*NL*
knocked
Grigory
down
and
run
away
.
When
we
told
him
that
Grigory
saw
the
*NL*
door
was
open
before
he
fell
down
,
and
had
heard
Smerdyakov
behind
the
*NL*
screen
as
he
came
out
of
his
bedroom
--
Karamazov
was
positively
crushed
.
My
*NL*
esteemed
and
witty
colleague
,
Nikolay
Parfenovitch
,
told
me
afterwards
*NL*
that
he
was
almost
moved
to
tears
at
the
sight
of
him
.
And
to
improve
*NL*
matters
,
the
prisoner
hastened
to
tell
us
about
the
much-talked-of
little
*NL*
bag
--
so
be
it
,
you
shall
hear
this
romance
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
I
have
told
you
already
why
I
consider
this
*NL*
romance
not
only
an
absurdity
,
but
the
most
improbable
invention
that
*NL*
could
have
been
brought
forward
in
the
circumstances
.
If
one
tried
for
a
*NL*
bet
to
invent
the
most
unlikely
story
,
one
could
hardly
find
anything
more
*NL*
incredible
.
The
worst
of
such
stories
is
that
the
triumphant
romancers
can
*NL*
always
be
put
to
confusion
and
crushed
by
the
very
details
in
which
real
*NL*
life
is
so
rich
and
which
these
unhappy
and
involuntary
story-tellers
*NL*
neglect
as
insignificant
trifles
.
Oh
,
they
have
no
thought
to
spare
for
*NL*
such
details
,
their
minds
are
concentrated
on
their
grand
invention
as
a
*NL*
whole
,
and
fancy
any
one
daring
to
pull
them
up
for
a
trifle
!
But
that
's
*NL*
how
they
are
caught
.
The
prisoner
was
asked
the
question
,
`
Where
did
you
*NL*
get
the
stuff
for
your
little
bag
and
who
made
it
for
you
?
'
'
I
made
it
*NL*
myself
.
'
`
And
where
did
you
get
the
linen
?
'
The
prisoner
was
positively
*NL*
offended
,
he
thought
it
almost
insulting
to
ask
him
such
a
trivial
*NL*
question
,
and
would
you
believe
it
,
his
resentment
was
genuine
!
But
they
*NL*
are
all
like
that
.
'
I
tore
it
off
my
shirt
.
'
`
Then
we
shall
find
that
*NL*
shirt
among
your
linen
to-morrow
,
with
a
piece
torn
off
.
'
And
only
fancy
,
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
if
we
really
had
found
that
torn
shirt
-LRB-
and
how
*NL*
could
we
have
failed
to
find
it
in
his
chest
of
drawers
or
trunk
?
-RRB-
that
*NL*
would
have
been
a
fact
,
a
material
fact
in
support
of
his
statement
!
But
*NL*
he
was
incapable
of
that
reflection
.
'
I
do
n't
remember
,
it
may
not
have
*NL*
been
off
my
shirt
,
I
sewed
it
up
in
one
of
my
landlady
's
caps
.
'
`
What
sort
*NL*
of
a
cap
?
'
`
It
was
an
old
cotton
rag
of
hers
lying
about
.
'
`
And
do
you
*NL*
remember
that
clearly
?
'
`
No
,
I
do
n't
.
'
And
he
was
angry
,
very
angry
,
and
*NL*
yet
imagine
not
remembering
it
!
At
the
most
terrible
moments
of
man
's
*NL*
life
,
for
instance
when
he
is
being
led
to
execution
,
he
remembers
just
*NL*
such
trifles
.
He
will
forget
anything
but
some
green
roof
that
has
flashed
*NL*
past
him
on
the
road
,
or
a
jackdaw
on
a
cross
--
that
he
will
remember
.
He
*NL*
concealed
the
making
of
that
little
bag
from
his
household
,
he
must
have
*NL*
remembered
his
humiliating
fear
that
some
one
might
come
in
and
find
him
*NL*
needle
in
hand
,
how
at
the
slightest
sound
he
slipped
behind
the
screen
*NL*
-LRB-
there
is
a
screen
in
his
lodgings
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
why
do
I
tell
you
all
this
,
all
these
*NL*
details
,
trifles
?
''
cried
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
suddenly
.
``
Just
because
the
*NL*
prisoner
still
persists
in
these
absurdities
to
this
moment
.
He
has
not
*NL*
explained
anything
since
that
fatal
night
two
months
ago
,
he
has
not
added
*NL*
one
actual
illuminating
fact
to
his
former
fantastic
statements
;
all
those
*NL*
are
trivialities
.
`
You
must
believe
it
on
my
honor
.
'
Oh
,
we
are
glad
to
*NL*
believe
it
,
we
are
eager
to
believe
it
,
even
if
only
on
his
word
of
honor
!
*NL*
Are
we
jackals
thirsting
for
human
blood
?
Show
us
a
single
fact
in
the
*NL*
prisoner
's
favor
and
we
shall
rejoice
;
but
let
it
be
a
substantial
,
real
*NL*
fact
,
and
not
a
conclusion
drawn
from
the
prisoner
's
expression
by
his
own
*NL*
brother
,
or
that
when
he
beat
himself
on
the
breast
he
must
have
meant
to
*NL*
point
to
the
little
bag
,
in
the
darkness
,
too
.
We
shall
rejoice
at
the
new
*NL*
fact
,
we
shall
be
the
first
to
repudiate
our
charge
,
we
shall
hasten
to
*NL*
repudiate
it
.
But
now
justice
cries
out
and
we
persist
,
we
can
not
*NL*
repudiate
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
passed
to
his
final
peroration
.
He
looked
as
though
*NL*
he
was
in
a
fever
,
he
spoke
of
the
blood
that
cried
for
vengeance
,
the
*NL*
blood
of
the
father
murdered
by
his
son
,
with
the
base
motive
of
robbery
!
*NL*
He
pointed
to
the
tragic
and
glaring
consistency
of
the
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whatever
you
may
hear
from
the
talented
and
celebrated
counsel
for
*NL*
the
defense
,
''
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
could
not
resist
adding
,
``
whatever
*NL*
eloquent
and
touching
appeals
may
be
made
to
your
sensibilities
,
remember
*NL*
that
at
this
moment
you
are
in
a
temple
of
justice
.
Remember
that
you
are
*NL*
the
champions
of
our
justice
,
the
champions
of
our
holy
Russia
,
of
her
*NL*
principles
,
her
family
,
everything
that
she
holds
sacred
!
Yes
,
you
*NL*
represent
Russia
here
at
this
moment
,
and
your
verdict
will
be
heard
not
*NL*
in
this
hall
only
but
will
reecho
throughout
the
whole
of
Russia
,
and
all
*NL*
Russia
will
hear
you
,
as
her
champions
and
her
judges
,
and
she
will
be
*NL*
encouraged
or
disheartened
by
your
verdict
.
Do
not
disappoint
Russia
and
*NL*
her
expectations
.
Our
fatal
troika
dashes
on
in
her
headlong
flight
*NL*
perhaps
to
destruction
and
in
all
Russia
for
long
past
men
have
stretched
*NL*
out
imploring
hands
and
called
a
halt
to
its
furious
reckless
course
.
And
*NL*
if
other
nations
stand
aside
from
that
troika
that
may
be
,
not
from
*NL*
respect
,
as
the
poet
would
fain
believe
,
but
simply
from
horror
.
From
*NL*
horror
,
perhaps
from
disgust
.
And
well
it
is
that
they
stand
aside
,
but
*NL*
maybe
they
will
cease
one
day
to
do
so
and
will
form
a
firm
wall
*NL*
confronting
the
hurrying
apparition
and
will
check
the
frenzied
rush
of
*NL*
our
lawlessness
,
for
the
sake
of
their
own
safety
,
enlightenment
and
*NL*
civilization
.
Already
we
have
heard
voices
of
alarm
from
Europe
,
they
*NL*
already
begin
to
sound
.
Do
not
tempt
them
!
Do
not
heap
up
their
growing
*NL*
hatred
by
a
sentence
justifying
the
murder
of
a
father
by
his
son
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
was
genuinely
moved
,
he
wound
up
his
speech
*NL*
with
this
rhetorical
appeal
--
and
the
effect
produced
by
him
was
*NL*
extraordinary
.
When
he
had
finished
his
speech
,
he
went
out
hurriedly
and
,
*NL*
as
I
have
mentioned
before
,
almost
fainted
in
the
adjoining
room
.
There
*NL*
was
no
applause
in
the
court
,
but
serious
persons
were
pleased
.
The
ladies
*NL*
were
not
so
well
satisfied
,
though
even
they
were
pleased
with
his
*NL*
eloquence
,
especially
as
they
had
no
apprehensions
as
to
the
upshot
of
the
*NL*
trial
and
had
full
trust
in
Fetyukovitch
.
``
He
will
speak
at
last
and
of
*NL*
course
carry
all
before
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
looked
at
Mitya
;
he
sat
silent
through
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
prosecutor
's
speech
,
clenching
his
teeth
,
with
his
hands
clasped
,
and
his
*NL*
head
bowed
.
Only
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
head
and
listened
,
*NL*
especially
when
Grushenka
was
spoken
of
.
When
the
prosecutor
mentioned
*NL*
Rakitin
's
opinion
of
her
,
a
smile
of
contempt
and
anger
passed
over
his
*NL*
face
and
he
murmured
rather
audibly
,
``
The
Bernards
!
''
When
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
described
how
he
had
questioned
and
tortured
him
at
Mokroe
,
*NL*
Mitya
raised
his
head
and
listened
with
intense
curiosity
.
At
one
point
he
*NL*
seemed
about
to
jump
up
and
cry
out
,
but
controlled
himself
and
only
*NL*
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
.
People
talked
afterwards
of
the
end
*NL*
of
the
speech
,
of
the
prosecutor
's
feat
in
examining
the
prisoner
at
*NL*
Mokroe
,
and
jeered
at
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
.
``
The
man
could
not
resist
*NL*
boasting
of
his
cleverness
,
''
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
court
was
adjourned
,
but
only
for
a
short
interval
,
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
or
twenty
minutes
at
most
.
There
was
a
hum
of
conversation
and
*NL*
exclamations
in
the
audience
.
I
remember
some
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
weighty
speech
,
''
a
gentleman
in
one
group
observed
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

much

said
another
voice

*NL*
*NL*
``

up

*NL*
*NL*
``

up

chimed
in
another
voice
.
``

*NL*

``
And
at

end

An
Argument

Cuts
Both
Ways

All
was
hushed
as
the
first
words
of
the
famous
orator
rang
out

The
eyes

of
the
audience
were
fastened
upon

He
began
very
simply

directly

with
an
air
of
conviction
,
but
not
the
slightest
trace
of
conceit
.
He
made
*NL*
no
attempt
at
eloquence
,
at
pathos
,
or
emotional
phrases
.
He
was
like
a
*NL*
man
speaking
in
a
circle
of
intimate
and
sympathetic
friends
.
His
voice
*NL*
was
a
fine
one
,
sonorous
and
sympathetic
,
and
there
was
something
genuine
*NL*
and
simple
in
the
very
sound
of
it
.
But
every
one
realized
at
once
that
*NL*
the
speaker
might
suddenly
rise
to
genuine
pathos
and
``
pierce
the
heart
*NL*
with
untold
power
.
''
His
language
was
perhaps
more
irregular
than
Ippolit
*NL*
Kirillovitch
's
,
but
he
spoke
without
long
phrases
,
and
indeed
,
with
more
*NL*
precision
.
One
thing
did
not
please
the
ladies
:
he
kept
bending
forward
,
*NL*
especially
at
the
beginning
of
his
speech
,
not
exactly
bowing
,
but
as
*NL*
though
he
were
about
to
dart
at
his
listeners
,
bending
his
long
spine
in
*NL*
half
,
as
though
there
were
a
spring
in
the
middle
that
enabled
him
to
bend
*NL*
almost
at
right
angles
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
his
speech
he
spoke
rather
disconnectedly
,
without
*NL*
system
,
one
may
say
,
dealing
with
facts
separately
,
though
,
at
the
end
,
*NL*
these
facts
formed
a
whole
.
His
speech
might
be
divided
into
two
parts
,
*NL*
the
first
consisting
of
criticism
in
refutation
of
the
charge
,
sometimes
*NL*
malicious
and
sarcastic
.
But
in
the
second
half
he
suddenly
changed
his
*NL*
tone
,
and
even
his
manner
,
and
at
once
rose
to
pathos
.
The
audience
seemed
*NL*
on
the
look-out
for
it
,
and
quivered
with
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
straight
to
the
point
,
and
began
by
saying
that
although
he
*NL*
practiced
in
Petersburg
,
he
had
more
than
once
visited
provincial
towns
to
*NL*
defend
prisoners
,
of
whose
innocence
he
had
a
conviction
or
at
least
a
*NL*
preconceived
idea
.
``
That
is
what
has
happened
to
me
in
the
present
case
,
''
*NL*
he
explained
.
``
From
the
very
first
accounts
in
the
newspapers
I
was
struck
*NL*
by
something
which
strongly
prepossessed
me
in
the
prisoner
's
favor
.
What
*NL*
interested
me
most
was
a
fact
which
often
occurs
in
legal
practice
,
but
*NL*
rarely
,
I
think
,
in
such
an
extreme
and
peculiar
form
as
in
the
present
*NL*
case
.
I
ought
to
formulate
that
peculiarity
only
at
the
end
of
my
speech
,
*NL*
but
I
will
do
so
at
the
very
beginning
,
for
it
is
my
weakness
to
go
to
*NL*
work
directly
,
not
keeping
my
effects
in
reserve
and
economizing
my
*NL*
material
.
That
may
be
imprudent
on
my
part
,
but
at
least
it
's
sincere
.
*NL*
What
I
have
in
my
mind
is
this
:
there
is
an
overwhelming
chain
of
evidence
*NL*
against
the
prisoner
,
and
at
the
same
time
not
one
fact
that
will
stand
*NL*
criticism
,
if
it
is
examined
separately
.
As
I
followed
the
case
more
*NL*
closely
in
the
papers
my
idea
was
more
and
more
confirmed
,
and
I
suddenly
*NL*
received
from
the
prisoner
's
relatives
a
request
to
undertake
his
defense
.
*NL*
I
at
once
hurried
here
,
and
here
I
became
completely
convinced
.
It
was
to
*NL*
break
down
this
terrible
chain
of
facts
,
and
to
show
that
each
piece
of
*NL*
evidence
taken
separately
was
unproved
and
fantastic
,
that
I
undertook
the
*NL*
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Fetyukovitch
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
''
he
suddenly
protested
,
``
I
am
new
to
this
*NL*
district
.
I
have
no
preconceived
ideas
.
The
prisoner
,
a
man
of
turbulent
*NL*
and
unbridled
temper
,
has
not
insulted
me
.
But
he
has
insulted
perhaps
*NL*
hundreds
of
persons
in
this
town
,
and
so
prejudiced
many
people
against
*NL*
him
beforehand
.
Of
course
I
recognize
that
the
moral
sentiment
of
local
*NL*
society
is
justly
excited
against
him
.
The
prisoner
is
of
turbulent
and
*NL*
violent
temper
.
Yet
he
was
received
in
society
here
;
he
was
even
welcome
*NL*
in
the
family
of
my
talented
friend
,
the
prosecutor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
N.B.
.
At
these
words
there
were
two
or
three
laughs
in
the
audience
,
*NL*
quickly
suppressed
,
but
noticed
by
all
.
All
of
us
knew
that
the
prosecutor
*NL*
received
Mitya
against
his
will
,
solely
because
he
had
somehow
interested
*NL*
his
wife
--
a
lady
of
the
highest
virtue
and
moral
worth
,
but
fanciful
,
*NL*
capricious
,
and
fond
of
opposing
her
husband
,
especially
in
trifles
.
*NL*
Mitya
's
visits
,
however
,
had
not
been
frequent
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
I
venture
to
suggest
,
''
Fetyukovitch
continued
,
``
that
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
independent
mind
and
just
character
,
my
opponent
may
have
*NL*
formed
a
mistaken
prejudice
against
my
unfortunate
client
.
Oh
,
that
is
so
*NL*
natural
;
the
unfortunate
man
has
only
too
well
deserved
such
prejudice
.
*NL*
Outraged
morality
,
and
still
more
outraged
taste
,
is
often
relentless
.
We
*NL*
have
,
in
the
talented
prosecutor
's
speech
,
heard
a
stern
analysis
of
the
*NL*
prisoner
's
character
and
conduct
,
and
his
severe
critical
attitude
to
the
*NL*
case
was
evident
.
And
,
what
's
more
,
he
went
into
psychological
subtleties
*NL*
into
which
he
could
not
have
entered
,
if
he
had
the
least
conscious
and
*NL*
malicious
prejudice
against
the
prisoner
.
But
there
are
things
which
are
*NL*
even
worse
,
even
more
fatal
in
such
cases
,
than
the
most
malicious
and
*NL*
consciously
unfair
attitude
.
It
is
worse
if
we
are
carried
away
by
the
*NL*
artistic
instinct
,
by
the
desire
to
create
,
so
to
speak
,
a
romance
,
*NL*
especially
if
God
has
endowed
us
with
psychological
insight
.
Before
I
*NL*
started
on
my
way
here
,
I
was
warned
in
Petersburg
,
and
was
myself
aware
,
*NL*
that
I
should
find
here
a
talented
opponent
whose
psychological
insight
*NL*
and
subtlety
had
gained
him
peculiar
renown
in
legal
circles
of
recent
*NL*
years
.
But
profound
as
psychology
is
,
it
's
a
knife
that
cuts
both
ways
.
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Laughter
among
the
public
.
-RRB-
``
You
will
,
of
course
,
forgive
me
my
*NL*
comparison
;
I
ca
n't
boast
of
eloquence
.
But
I
will
take
as
an
example
any
*NL*
point
in
the
prosecutor
's
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prisoner
,
running
away
in
the
garden
in
the
dark
,
climbed
over
the
*NL*
fence
,
was
seized
by
the
servant
,
and
knocked
him
down
with
a
brass
*NL*
pestle
.
Then
he
jumped
back
into
the
garden
and
spent
five
minutes
over
*NL*
the
man
,
trying
to
discover
whether
he
had
killed
him
or
not
.
And
the
*NL*
prosecutor
refuses
to
believe
the
prisoner
's
statement
that
he
ran
to
old
*NL*
Grigory
out
of
pity
.
`
No
,
'
he
says
,
`
such
sensibility
is
impossible
at
*NL*
such
a
moment
,
that
's
unnatural
;
he
ran
to
find
out
whether
the
only
*NL*
witness
of
his
crime
was
dead
or
alive
,
and
so
showed
that
he
had
*NL*
committed
the
murder
,
since
he
would
not
have
run
back
for
any
other
*NL*
reason
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
have
psychology
;
but
let
us
take
the
same
method
and
apply
it
to
*NL*
the
case
the
other
way
round
,
and
our
result
will
be
no
less
probable
.
The
*NL*
murderer
,
we
are
told
,
leapt
down
to
find
out
,
as
a
precaution
,
whether
*NL*
the
witness
was
alive
or
not
,
yet
he
had
left
in
his
murdered
father
's
*NL*
study
,
as
the
prosecutor
himself
argues
,
an
amazing
piece
of
evidence
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
a
torn
envelope
,
with
an
inscription
that
there
had
been
*NL*
three
thousand
roubles
in
it
.
`
If
he
had
carried
that
envelope
away
with
*NL*
him
,
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
known
of
that
envelope
and
of
the
*NL*
notes
in
it
,
and
that
the
money
had
been
stolen
by
the
prisoner
.
'
Those
*NL*
are
the
prosecutor
's
own
words
.
So
on
one
side
you
see
a
complete
absence
*NL*
of
precaution
,
a
man
who
has
lost
his
head
and
run
away
in
a
fright
,
*NL*
leaving
that
clew
on
the
floor
,
and
two
minutes
later
,
when
he
has
killed
*NL*
another
man
,
we
are
entitled
to
assume
the
most
heartless
and
calculating
*NL*
foresight
in
him
.
But
even
admitting
this
was
so
,
it
is
psychological
*NL*
subtlety
,
I
suppose
,
that
discerns
that
under
certain
circumstances
I
*NL*
become
as
bloodthirsty
and
keen-sighted
as
a
Caucasian
eagle
,
while
at
the
*NL*
next
I
am
as
timid
and
blind
as
a
mole
.
But
if
I
am
so
bloodthirsty
and
*NL*
cruelly
calculating
that
when
I
kill
a
man
I
only
run
back
to
find
out
*NL*
whether
he
is
alive
to
witness
against
me
,
why
should
I
spend
five
minutes
*NL*
looking
after
my
victim
at
the
risk
of
encountering
other
witnesses
?
Why
*NL*
soak
my
handkerchief
,
wiping
the
blood
off
his
head
so
that
it
may
be
*NL*
evidence
against
me
later
?
If
he
were
so
cold-hearted
and
calculating
,
why
*NL*
not
hit
the
servant
on
the
head
again
and
again
with
the
same
pestle
so
as
*NL*
to
kill
him
outright
and
relieve
himself
of
all
anxiety
about
the
witness
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
,
though
he
ran
to
see
whether
the
witness
was
alive
,
he
left
*NL*
another
witness
on
the
path
,
that
brass
pestle
which
he
had
taken
from
the
*NL*
two
women
,
and
which
they
could
always
recognize
afterwards
as
theirs
,
and
*NL*
prove
that
he
had
taken
it
from
them
.
And
it
is
not
as
though
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
it
on
the
path
,
dropped
it
through
carelessness
or
haste
,
no
,
he
*NL*
had
flung
away
his
weapon
,
for
it
was
found
fifteen
paces
from
where
*NL*
Grigory
lay
.
Why
did
he
do
so
?
Just
because
he
was
grieved
at
having
*NL*
killed
a
man
,
an
old
servant
;
and
he
flung
away
the
pestle
with
a
curse
,
*NL*
as
a
murderous
weapon
.
That
's
how
it
must
have
been
,
what
other
reason
*NL*
could
he
have
had
for
throwing
it
so
far
?
And
if
he
was
capable
of
feeling
*NL*
grief
and
pity
at
having
killed
a
man
,
it
shows
that
he
was
innocent
of
*NL*
his
father
's
murder
.
Had
he
murdered
him
,
he
would
never
have
run
to
*NL*
another
victim
out
of
pity
;
then
he
would
have
felt
differently
;
his
*NL*
thoughts
would
have
been
centered
on
self-preservation
.
He
would
have
had
*NL*
none
to
spare
for
pity
,
that
is
beyond
doubt
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
would
*NL*
have
broken
his
skull
instead
of
spending
five
minutes
looking
after
him
.
*NL*
There
was
room
for
pity
and
good-feeling
just
because
his
conscience
had
*NL*
been
clear
till
then
.
Here
we
have
a
different
psychology
.
I
have
*NL*
purposely
resorted
to
this
method
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
to
show
that
you
*NL*
can
prove
anything
by
it
.
It
all
depends
on
who
makes
use
of
it
.
*NL*
Psychology
lures
even
most
serious
people
into
romancing
,
and
quite
*NL*
unconsciously
.
I
am
speaking
of
the
abuse
of
psychology
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sounds
of
approval
and
laughter
,
at
the
expense
of
the
prosecutor
,
were
*NL*
again
audible
in
the
court
.
I
will
not
repeat
the
speech
in
detail
;
I
will
*NL*
only
quote
some
passages
from
it
,
some
leading
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XI
.
There
Was
No
Money
.
There
Was
No
Robbery
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
point
that
struck
every
one
in
Fetyukovitch
's
speech
.
He
*NL*
flatly
denied
the
existence
of
the
fatal
three
thousand
roubles
,
and
*NL*
consequently
,
the
possibility
of
their
having
been
stolen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
''
he
began
.
``
Every
new
and
unprejudiced
observer
*NL*
must
be
struck
by
a
characteristic
peculiarity
in
the
present
case
,
*NL*
namely
,
the
charge
of
robbery
,
and
the
complete
impossibility
of
proving
*NL*
that
there
was
anything
to
be
stolen
.
We
are
told
that
money
was
*NL*
stolen
--
three
thousand
roubles
--
but
whether
those
roubles
ever
existed
,
*NL*
nobody
knows
.
Consider
,
how
have
we
heard
of
that
sum
,
and
who
has
seen
*NL*
the
notes
?
The
only
person
who
saw
them
,
and
stated
that
they
had
been
put
*NL*
in
the
envelope
,
was
the
servant
,
Smerdyakov
.
He
had
spoken
of
it
to
the
*NL*
prisoner
and
his
brother
,
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
,
before
the
catastrophe
.
*NL*
Madame
Svyetlov
,
too
,
had
been
told
of
it
.
But
not
one
of
these
three
*NL*
persons
had
actually
seen
the
notes
,
no
one
but
Smerdyakov
had
seen
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
the
question
arises
,
if
it
's
true
that
they
did
exist
,
and
that
*NL*
Smerdyakov
had
seen
them
,
when
did
he
see
them
for
the
last
time
?
What
if
*NL*
his
master
had
taken
the
notes
from
under
his
bed
and
put
them
back
in
his
*NL*
cash-box
without
telling
him
?
Note
,
that
according
to
Smerdyakov
's
story
*NL*
the
notes
were
kept
under
the
mattress
;
the
prisoner
must
have
pulled
them
*NL*
out
,
and
yet
the
bed
was
absolutely
unrumpled
;
that
is
carefully
recorded
*NL*
in
the
protocol
.
How
could
the
prisoner
have
found
the
notes
without
*NL*
disturbing
the
bed
?
How
could
he
have
helped
soiling
with
his
blood
-
*NL*
stained
hands
the
fine
and
spotless
linen
with
which
the
bed
had
been
*NL*
purposely
made
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
be
asked
:
What
about
the
envelope
on
the
floor
?
Yes
,
it
's
*NL*
worth
saying
a
word
or
two
about
that
envelope
.
I
was
somewhat
surprised
*NL*
just
now
to
hear
the
highly
talented
prosecutor
declare
of
himself
--
of
*NL*
himself
,
observe
--
that
but
for
that
envelope
,
but
for
its
being
left
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
known
of
the
existence
of
that
*NL*
envelope
and
the
notes
in
it
,
and
therefore
of
the
prisoner
's
having
*NL*
stolen
it
.
And
so
that
torn
scrap
of
paper
is
,
by
the
prosecutor
's
own
*NL*
admission
,
the
sole
proof
on
which
the
charge
of
robbery
rests
,
`
otherwise
*NL*
no
one
would
have
known
of
the
robbery
,
nor
perhaps
even
of
the
money
.
'
*NL*
But
is
the
mere
fact
that
that
scrap
of
paper
was
lying
on
the
floor
a
*NL*
proof
that
there
was
money
in
it
,
and
that
that
money
had
been
stolen
?
*NL*
Yet
,
it
will
be
objected
,
Smerdyakov
had
seen
the
money
in
the
envelope
.
*NL*
But
when
,
when
had
he
seen
it
for
the
last
time
,
I
ask
you
that
?
I
talked
*NL*
to
Smerdyakov
,
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
seen
the
notes
two
days
before
*NL*
the
catastrophe
.
Then
why
not
imagine
that
old
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
locked
*NL*
up
alone
in
impatient
and
hysterical
expectation
of
the
object
of
his
*NL*
adoration
,
may
have
whiled
away
the
time
by
breaking
open
the
envelope
and
*NL*
taking
out
the
notes
.
`
What
's
the
use
of
the
envelope
?
'
he
may
have
asked
*NL*
himself
.
`
She
wo
n't
believe
the
notes
are
there
,
but
when
I
show
her
the
*NL*
thirty
rainbow-colored
notes
in
one
roll
,
it
will
make
more
impression
,
*NL*
you
may
be
sure
,
it
will
make
her
mouth
water
.
'
And
so
he
tears
open
the
*NL*
envelope
,
takes
out
the
money
,
and
flings
the
envelope
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
conscious
of
being
the
owner
and
untroubled
by
any
fears
of
leaving
*NL*
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
gentlemen
,
could
anything
be
more
likely
than
this
theory
and
*NL*
such
an
action
?
Why
is
it
out
of
the
question
?
But
if
anything
of
the
sort
*NL*
could
have
taken
place
,
the
charge
of
robbery
falls
to
the
ground
;
if
*NL*
there
was
no
money
,
there
was
no
theft
of
it
.
If
the
envelope
on
the
floor
*NL*
may
be
taken
as
evidence
that
there
had
been
money
in
it
,
why
may
I
not
*NL*
maintain
the
opposite
,
that
the
envelope
was
on
the
floor
because
the
*NL*
money
had
been
taken
from
it
by
its
owner
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
be
asked
what
became
of
the
money
if
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
took
*NL*
it
out
of
the
envelope
since
it
was
not
found
when
the
police
searched
the
*NL*
house
?
In
the
first
place
,
part
of
the
money
was
found
in
the
cash-box
,
*NL*
and
secondly
,
he
might
have
taken
it
out
that
morning
or
the
evening
*NL*
before
to
make
some
other
use
of
it
,
to
give
or
send
it
away
;
he
may
have
*NL*
changed
his
idea
,
his
plan
of
action
completely
,
without
thinking
it
*NL*
necessary
to
announce
the
fact
to
Smerdyakov
beforehand
.
And
if
there
is
*NL*
the
barest
possibility
of
such
an
explanation
,
how
can
the
prisoner
be
so
*NL*
positively
accused
of
having
committed
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
,
and
*NL*
of
having
actually
carried
out
that
robbery
?
This
is
encroaching
on
the
*NL*
domain
of
romance
.
If
it
is
maintained
that
something
has
been
stolen
,
the
*NL*
thing
must
be
produced
,
or
at
least
its
existence
must
be
proved
beyond
*NL*
doubt
.
Yet
no
one
had
ever
seen
these
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
long
ago
in
Petersburg
a
young
man
of
eighteen
,
hardly
more
than
a
*NL*
boy
,
who
carried
on
a
small
business
as
a
costermonger
,
went
in
broad
*NL*
daylight
into
a
moneychanger
's
shop
with
an
ax
,
and
with
extraordinary
,
*NL*
typical
audacity
killed
the
master
of
the
shop
and
carried
off
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
roubles
.
Five
hours
later
he
was
arrested
,
and
,
except
fifteen
*NL*
roubles
he
had
already
managed
to
spend
,
the
whole
sum
was
found
on
him
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
shopman
,
on
his
return
to
the
shop
after
the
murder
,
*NL*
informed
the
police
not
only
of
the
exact
sum
stolen
,
but
even
of
the
*NL*
notes
and
gold
coins
of
which
that
sum
was
made
up
,
and
those
very
notes
*NL*
and
coins
were
found
on
the
criminal
.
This
was
followed
by
a
full
and
*NL*
genuine
confession
on
the
part
of
the
murderer
.
That
's
what
I
call
*NL*
evidence
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
!
In
that
case
I
know
,
I
see
,
I
touch
the
*NL*
money
,
and
can
not
deny
its
existence
.
Is
it
the
same
in
the
present
case
?
*NL*
And
yet
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
be
told
,
but
he
was
carousing
that
night
,
squandering
money
;
*NL*
he
was
shown
to
have
had
fifteen
hundred
roubles
--
where
did
he
get
the
*NL*
money
?
But
the
very
fact
that
only
fifteen
hundred
could
be
found
,
and
the
*NL*
other
half
of
the
sum
could
nowhere
be
discovered
,
shows
that
that
money
*NL*
was
not
the
same
,
and
had
never
been
in
any
envelope
.
By
strict
*NL*
calculation
of
time
it
was
proved
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
that
the
*NL*
prisoner
ran
straight
from
those
women
servants
to
Perhotin
's
without
*NL*
going
home
,
and
that
he
had
been
nowhere
.
So
he
had
been
all
the
time
in
*NL*
company
and
therefore
could
not
have
divided
the
three
thousand
in
half
*NL*
and
hidden
half
in
the
town
.
It
's
just
this
consideration
that
has
led
the
*NL*
prosecutor
to
assume
that
the
money
is
hidden
in
some
crevice
at
Mokroe
.
*NL*
Why
not
in
the
dungeons
of
the
castle
of
Udolpho
,
gentlemen
?
Is
n't
this
*NL*
supposition
really
too
fantastic
and
too
romantic
?
And
observe
,
if
that
*NL*
supposition
breaks
down
,
the
whole
charge
of
robbery
is
scattered
to
the
*NL*
winds
,
for
in
that
case
what
could
have
become
of
the
other
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
roubles
?
By
what
miracle
could
they
have
disappeared
,
since
it
's
*NL*
proved
the
prisoner
went
nowhere
else
?
And
we
are
ready
to
ruin
a
man
's
*NL*
life
with
such
tales
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
told
that
he
could
not
explain
where
he
got
the
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
that
he
had
,
and
every
one
knew
that
he
was
without
money
before
*NL*
that
night
.
Who
knew
it
,
pray
?
The
prisoner
has
made
a
clear
and
*NL*
unflinching
statement
of
the
source
of
that
money
,
and
if
you
will
have
it
*NL*
so
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
nothing
can
be
more
probable
than
that
*NL*
statement
,
and
more
consistent
with
the
temper
and
spirit
of
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
The
prosecutor
is
charmed
with
his
own
romance
.
A
man
of
weak
will
,
who
*NL*
had
brought
himself
to
take
the
three
thousand
so
insultingly
offered
by
*NL*
his
betrothed
,
could
not
,
we
are
told
,
have
set
aside
half
and
sewn
it
up
,
*NL*
but
would
,
even
if
he
had
done
so
,
have
unpicked
it
every
two
days
and
*NL*
taken
out
a
hundred
,
and
so
would
have
spent
it
all
in
a
month
.
All
this
,
*NL*
you
will
remember
,
was
put
forward
in
a
tone
that
brooked
no
*NL*
contradiction
.
But
what
if
the
thing
happened
quite
differently
?
What
if
*NL*
you
've
been
weaving
a
romance
,
and
about
quite
a
different
kind
of
man
?
*NL*
That
's
just
it
,
you
have
invented
quite
a
different
man
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
told
,
perhaps
,
there
are
witnesses
that
he
spent
on
one
day
*NL*
all
that
three
thousand
given
him
by
his
betrothed
a
month
before
the
*NL*
catastrophe
,
so
he
could
not
have
divided
the
sum
in
half
.
But
who
are
*NL*
these
witnesses
?
The
value
of
their
evidence
has
been
shown
in
court
*NL*
already
.
Besides
,
in
another
man
's
hand
a
crust
always
seems
larger
,
and
*NL*
no
one
of
these
witnesses
counted
that
money
;
they
all
judged
simply
at
*NL*
sight
.
And
the
witness
Maximov
has
testified
that
the
prisoner
had
twenty
*NL*
thousand
in
his
hand
.
You
see
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
psychology
is
a
two
-
*NL*
edged
weapon
.
Let
me
turn
the
other
edge
now
and
see
what
comes
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
month
before
the
catastrophe
the
prisoner
was
entrusted
by
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
with
three
thousand
roubles
to
send
off
by
post
.
But
the
question
*NL*
is
:
is
it
true
that
they
were
entrusted
to
him
in
such
an
insulting
and
*NL*
degrading
way
as
was
proclaimed
just
now
?
The
first
statement
made
by
the
*NL*
young
lady
on
the
subject
was
different
,
perfectly
different
.
In
the
*NL*
second
statement
we
heard
only
cries
of
resentment
and
revenge
,
cries
of
*NL*
long-concealed
hatred
.
And
the
very
fact
that
the
witness
gave
her
first
*NL*
evidence
incorrectly
,
gives
us
a
right
to
conclude
that
her
second
piece
*NL*
of
evidence
may
have
been
incorrect
also
.
The
prosecutor
will
not
,
dare
*NL*
not
-LRB-
his
own
words
-RRB-
touch
on
that
story
.
So
be
it
.
I
will
not
touch
on
it
*NL*
either
,
but
will
only
venture
to
observe
that
if
a
lofty
and
high
-
*NL*
principled
person
,
such
as
that
highly
respected
young
lady
unquestionably
*NL*
is
,
if
such
a
person
,
I
say
,
allows
herself
suddenly
in
court
to
*NL*
contradict
her
first
statement
,
with
the
obvious
motive
of
ruining
the
*NL*
prisoner
,
it
is
clear
that
this
evidence
has
been
given
not
impartially
,
*NL*
not
coolly
.
Have
not
we
the
right
to
assume
that
a
revengeful
woman
might
*NL*
have
exaggerated
much
?
Yes
,
she
may
well
have
exaggerated
,
in
particular
,
*NL*
the
insult
and
humiliation
of
her
offering
him
the
money
.
No
,
it
was
*NL*
offered
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
possible
to
take
it
,
especially
for
a
*NL*
man
so
easy-going
as
the
prisoner
,
above
all
,
as
he
expected
to
receive
*NL*
shortly
from
his
father
the
three
thousand
roubles
that
he
reckoned
was
*NL*
owing
to
him
.
It
was
unreflecting
of
him
,
but
it
was
just
his
*NL*
irresponsible
want
of
reflection
that
made
him
so
confident
that
his
*NL*
father
would
give
him
the
money
,
that
he
would
get
it
,
and
so
could
always
*NL*
dispatch
the
money
entrusted
to
him
and
repay
the
debt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
allow
that
he
could
the
same
day
have
set
*NL*
aside
half
the
money
and
sewn
it
up
in
a
little
bag
.
That
's
not
his
*NL*
character
,
he
tells
us
,
he
could
n't
have
had
such
feelings
.
But
yet
he
*NL*
talked
himself
of
the
broad
Karamazov
nature
;
he
cried
out
about
the
two
*NL*
extremes
which
a
Karamazov
can
contemplate
at
once
.
Karamazov
is
just
such
*NL*
a
two-sided
nature
,
fluctuating
between
two
extremes
,
that
even
when
moved
*NL*
by
the
most
violent
craving
for
riotous
gayety
,
he
can
pull
himself
up
,
if
*NL*
something
strikes
him
on
the
other
side
.
And
on
the
other
side
is
*NL*
love
--
that
new
love
which
had
flamed
up
in
his
heart
,
and
for
that
love
he
*NL*
needed
money
;
oh
,
far
more
than
for
carousing
with
his
mistress
.
If
she
*NL*
were
to
say
to
him
,
'
I
am
yours
,
I
wo
n't
have
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
'
then
he
*NL*
must
have
money
to
take
her
away
.
That
was
more
important
than
carousing
.
*NL*
Could
a
Karamazov
fail
to
understand
it
?
That
anxiety
was
just
what
he
was
*NL*
suffering
from
--
what
is
there
improbable
in
his
laying
aside
that
money
and
*NL*
concealing
it
in
case
of
emergency
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
time
passed
,
and
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
did
not
give
the
prisoner
the
*NL*
expected
three
thousand
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
latter
heard
that
he
meant
*NL*
to
use
this
sum
to
seduce
the
woman
he
,
the
prisoner
,
loved
.
`
If
Fyodor
*NL*
Pavlovitch
does
n't
give
the
money
,
'
he
thought
,
'
I
shall
be
put
in
the
*NL*
position
of
a
thief
before
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
'
And
then
the
idea
presented
*NL*
itself
to
him
that
he
would
go
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
lay
before
her
the
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
roubles
he
still
carried
round
his
neck
,
and
say
,
'
I
am
a
*NL*
scoundrel
,
but
not
a
thief
.
'
So
here
we
have
already
a
twofold
reason
why
*NL*
he
should
guard
that
sum
of
money
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
,
why
he
*NL*
should
n't
unpick
the
little
bag
,
and
spend
it
a
hundred
at
a
time
.
Why
*NL*
should
you
deny
the
prisoner
a
sense
of
honor
?
Yes
,
he
has
a
sense
of
*NL*
honor
,
granted
that
it
's
misplaced
,
granted
it
's
often
mistaken
,
yet
it
*NL*
exists
and
amounts
to
a
passion
,
and
he
has
proved
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
the
affair
becomes
even
more
complex
;
his
jealous
torments
reach
*NL*
a
climax
,
and
those
same
two
questions
torture
his
fevered
brain
more
and
*NL*
more
:
`
If
I
repay
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
where
can
I
find
the
means
to
go
off
*NL*
with
Grushenka
?
'
If
he
behaved
wildly
,
drank
,
and
made
disturbances
in
the
*NL*
taverns
in
the
course
of
that
month
,
it
was
perhaps
because
he
was
*NL*
wretched
and
strained
beyond
his
powers
of
endurance
.
These
two
questions
*NL*
became
so
acute
that
they
drove
him
at
last
to
despair
.
He
sent
his
*NL*
younger
brother
to
beg
for
the
last
time
for
the
three
thousand
roubles
,
*NL*
but
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
burst
in
himself
and
ended
by
beating
the
*NL*
old
man
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
.
After
that
he
had
no
prospect
of
*NL*
getting
it
from
any
one
;
his
father
would
not
give
it
him
after
that
*NL*
beating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
evening
he
struck
himself
on
the
breast
,
just
on
the
upper
part
*NL*
of
the
breast
where
the
little
bag
was
,
and
swore
to
his
brother
that
he
*NL*
had
the
means
of
not
being
a
scoundrel
,
but
that
still
he
would
remain
a
*NL*
scoundrel
,
for
he
foresaw
that
he
would
not
use
that
means
,
that
he
*NL*
would
n't
have
the
character
,
that
he
would
n't
have
the
will-power
to
do
*NL*
it
.
Why
,
why
does
the
prosecutor
refuse
to
believe
the
evidence
of
Alexey
*NL*
Karamazov
,
given
so
genuinely
and
sincerely
,
so
spontaneously
and
*NL*
convincingly
?
And
why
,
on
the
contrary
,
does
he
force
me
to
believe
in
*NL*
money
hidden
in
a
crevice
,
in
the
dungeons
of
the
castle
of
Udolpho
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
evening
,
after
his
talk
with
his
brother
,
the
prisoner
wrote
*NL*
that
fatal
letter
,
and
that
letter
is
the
chief
,
the
most
stupendous
proof
*NL*
of
the
prisoner
having
committed
robbery
!
'
I
shall
beg
from
every
one
,
and
*NL*
if
I
do
n't
get
it
I
shall
murder
my
father
and
shall
take
the
envelope
*NL*
with
the
pink
ribbon
on
it
from
under
his
mattress
as
soon
as
Ivan
has
*NL*
gone
.
'
A
full
program
of
the
murder
,
we
are
told
,
so
it
must
have
been
he
.
*NL*
`
It
has
all
been
done
as
he
wrote
,
'
cries
the
prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
first
place
,
it
's
the
letter
of
a
drunken
man
and
written
in
*NL*
great
irritation
;
secondly
,
he
writes
of
the
envelope
from
what
he
has
*NL*
heard
from
Smerdyakov
again
,
for
he
has
not
seen
the
envelope
himself
;
and
*NL*
thirdly
,
he
wrote
it
indeed
,
but
how
can
you
prove
that
he
did
it
?
Did
the
*NL*
prisoner
take
the
envelope
from
under
the
pillow
,
did
he
find
the
money
,
*NL*
did
that
money
exist
indeed
?
And
was
it
to
get
money
that
the
prisoner
ran
*NL*
off
,
if
you
remember
?
He
ran
off
post-haste
not
to
steal
,
but
to
find
out
*NL*
where
she
was
,
the
woman
who
had
crushed
him
.
He
was
not
running
to
carry
*NL*
out
a
program
,
to
carry
out
what
he
had
written
,
that
is
,
not
for
an
act
*NL*
of
premeditated
robbery
,
but
he
ran
suddenly
,
spontaneously
,
in
a
jealous
*NL*
fury
.
Yes
!
I
shall
be
told
,
but
when
he
got
there
and
murdered
him
he
*NL*
seized
the
money
,
too
.
But
did
he
murder
him
after
all
?
The
charge
of
*NL*
robbery
I
repudiate
with
indignation
.
A
man
can
not
be
accused
of
robbery
,
*NL*
if
it
's
impossible
to
state
accurately
what
he
has
stolen
;
that
's
an
*NL*
axiom
.
But
did
he
murder
him
without
robbery
,
did
he
murder
him
at
all
?
Is
*NL*
that
proved
?
Is
n't
that
,
too
,
a
romance
?

Allow
me
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
to
remind
you
that
a
man
's
life
is
at
*NL*
stake
and
that
you
must
be
careful
.
We
have
heard
the
prosecutor
himself
*NL*
admit
that
until
to-day
he
hesitated
to
accuse
the
prisoner
of
a
full
and
*NL*
conscious
premeditation
of
the
crime
;
he
hesitated
till
he
saw
that
fatal
*NL*
drunken
letter
which
was
produced
in
court
to-day
.
`
All
was
done
as
*NL*
written
.
'
But
,
I
repeat
again
,
he
was
running
to
her
,
to
seek
her
,
solely
*NL*
to
find
out
where
she
was
.
That
's
a
fact
that
ca
n't
be
disputed
.
Had
she
*NL*
been
at
home
,
he
would
not
have
run
away
,
but
would
have
remained
at
her
*NL*
side
,
and
so
would
not
have
done
what
he
promised
in
the
letter
.
He
ran
*NL*
unexpectedly
and
accidentally
,
and
by
that
time
very
likely
he
did
not
*NL*
even
remember
his
drunken
letter
.
`
He
snatched
up
the
pestle
,
'
they
say
,
*NL*
and
you
will
remember
how
a
whole
edifice
of
psychology
was
built
on
that
*NL*
pestle
--
why
he
was
bound
to
look
at
that
pestle
as
a
weapon
,
to
snatch
it
*NL*
up
,
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
A
very
commonplace
idea
occurs
to
me
at
this
*NL*
point
:
What
if
that
pestle
had
not
been
in
sight
,
had
not
been
lying
on
*NL*
the
shelf
from
which
it
was
snatched
by
the
prisoner
,
but
had
been
put
*NL*
away
in
a
cupboard
?
It
would
not
have
caught
the
prisoner
's
eye
,
and
he
*NL*
would
have
run
away
without
a
weapon
,
with
empty
hands
,
and
then
he
would
*NL*
certainly
not
have
killed
any
one
.
How
then
can
I
look
upon
the
pestle
as
*NL*
a
proof
of
premeditation
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
talked
in
the
taverns
of
murdering
his
father
,
and
two
days
*NL*
before
,
on
the
evening
when
he
wrote
his
drunken
letter
,
he
was
quiet
and
*NL*
only
quarreled
with
a
shopman
in
the
tavern
,
because
a
Karamazov
could
not
*NL*
help
quarreling
,
forsooth
!
But
my
answer
to
that
is
,
that
,
if
he
was
*NL*
planning
such
a
murder
in
accordance
with
his
letter
,
he
certainly
would
*NL*
not
have
quarreled
even
with
a
shopman
,
and
probably
would
not
have
gone
*NL*
into
the
tavern
at
all
,
because
a
person
plotting
such
a
crime
seeks
quiet
*NL*
and
retirement
,
seeks
to
efface
himself
,
to
avoid
being
seen
and
heard
,
*NL*
and
that
not
from
calculation
,
but
from
instinct
.
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
*NL*
the
psychological
method
is
a
two-edged
weapon
,
and
we
,
too
,
can
use
it
.
*NL*
As
for
all
this
shouting
in
taverns
throughout
the
month
,
do
n't
we
often
*NL*
hear
children
,
or
drunkards
coming
out
of
taverns
shout
,
`
I
'll
kill
you
'
?
*NL*
but
they
do
n't
murder
any
one
.
And
that
fatal
letter
--
is
n't
that
simply
*NL*
drunken
irritability
,
too
?
Is
n't
that
simply
the
shout
of
the
brawler
*NL*
outside
the
tavern
,
`
I
'll
kill
you
!
I
'll
kill
the
lot
of
you
!
'
Why
not
,
*NL*
why
could
it
not
be
that
?
What
reason
have
we
to
call
that
letter
`
fatal
'
*NL*
rather
than
absurd
?
Because
his
father
has
been
found
murdered
,
because
a
*NL*
witness
saw
the
prisoner
running
out
of
the
garden
with
a
weapon
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
was
knocked
down
by
him
:
therefore
,
we
are
told
,
everything
was
*NL*
done
as
he
had
planned
in
writing
,
and
the
letter
was
not
`
absurd
,
'
but
*NL*
`
fatal
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
thank
God
!
we
've
come
to
the
real
point
:
`
since
he
was
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
he
must
have
murdered
him
.
'
In
those
few
words
:
`
since
he
_
was
_
,
*NL*
then
he
_
must
_
'
lies
the
whole
case
for
the
prosecution
.
He
was
there
,
so
*NL*
he
must
have
.
And
what
if
there
is
no
_
must
_
about
it
,
even
if
he
was
*NL*
there
?
Oh
,
I
admit
that
the
chain
of
evidence
--
the
coincidences
--
are
really
*NL*
suggestive
.
But
examine
all
these
facts
separately
,
regardless
of
their
*NL*
connection
.
Why
,
for
instance
,
does
the
prosecution
refuse
to
admit
the
*NL*
truth
of
the
prisoner
's
statement
that
he
ran
away
from
his
father
's
*NL*
window
?
Remember
the
sarcasms
in
which
the
prosecutor
indulged
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
the
respectful
and
`
pious
'
sentiments
which
suddenly
came
over
*NL*
the
murderer
.
But
what
if
there
were
something
of
the
sort
,
a
feeling
of
*NL*
religious
awe
,
if
not
of
filial
respect
?
`
My
mother
must
have
been
praying
*NL*
for
me
at
that
moment
,
'
were
the
prisoner
's
words
at
the
preliminary
*NL*
inquiry
,
and
so
he
ran
away
as
soon
as
he
convinced
himself
that
Madame
*NL*
Svyetlov
was
not
in
his
father
's
house
.
`
But
he
could
not
convince
himself
*NL*
by
looking
through
the
window
,
'
the
prosecutor
objects
.
But
why
could
n't
*NL*
he
?
Why
?
The
window
opened
at
the
signals
given
by
the
prisoner
.
Some
word
*NL*
might
have
been
uttered
by
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
some
exclamation
which
*NL*
showed
the
prisoner
that
she
was
not
there
.
Why
should
we
assume
*NL*
everything
as
we
imagine
it
,
as
we
make
up
our
minds
to
imagine
it
?
A
*NL*
thousand
things
may
happen
in
reality
which
elude
the
subtlest
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
but
Grigory
saw
the
door
open
and
so
the
prisoner
certainly
was
in
*NL*
the
house
,
therefore
he
killed
him
.
'
Now
about
that
door
,
gentlemen
of
the
*NL*
jury
...
Observe
that
we
have
only
the
statement
of
one
witness
as
to
that
*NL*
door
,
and
he
was
at
the
time
in
such
a
condition
,
that
--
But
supposing
the
*NL*
door
was
open
;
supposing
the
prisoner
has
lied
in
denying
it
,
from
an
*NL*
instinct
of
self-defense
,
natural
in
his
position
;
supposing
he
did
go
*NL*
into
the
house
--
well
,
what
then
?
How
does
it
follow
that
because
he
was
*NL*
there
he
committed
the
murder
?
He
might
have
dashed
in
,
run
through
the
*NL*
rooms
;
might
have
pushed
his
father
away
;
might
have
struck
him
;
but
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
made
sure
Madame
Svyetlov
was
not
there
,
he
may
have
run
*NL*
away
rejoicing
that
she
was
not
there
and
that
he
had
not
killed
his
*NL*
father
.
And
it
was
perhaps
just
because
he
had
escaped
from
the
temptation
*NL*
to
kill
his
father
,
because
he
had
a
clear
conscience
and
was
rejoicing
at
*NL*
not
having
killed
him
,
that
he
was
capable
of
a
pure
feeling
,
the
feeling
*NL*
of
pity
and
compassion
,
and
leapt
off
the
fence
a
minute
later
to
the
*NL*
assistance
of
Grigory
after
he
had
,
in
his
excitement
,
knocked
him
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
terrible
eloquence
the
prosecutor
has
described
to
us
the
dreadful
*NL*
state
of
the
prisoner
's
mind
at
Mokroe
when
love
again
lay
before
him
*NL*
calling
him
to
new
life
,
while
love
was
impossible
for
him
because
he
had
*NL*
his
father
's
bloodstained
corpse
behind
him
and
beyond
that
*NL*
corpse
--
retribution
.
And
yet
the
prosecutor
allowed
him
love
,
which
he
*NL*
explained
,
according
to
his
method
,
talking
about
his
drunken
condition
,
*NL*
about
a
criminal
being
taken
to
execution
,
about
it
being
still
far
off
,
*NL*
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
But
again
I
ask
,
Mr.
Prosecutor
,
have
you
not
*NL*
invented
a
new
personality
?
Is
the
prisoner
so
coarse
and
heartless
as
to
*NL*
be
able
to
think
at
that
moment
of
love
and
of
dodges
to
escape
*NL*
punishment
,
if
his
hands
were
really
stained
with
his
father
's
blood
?
No
,
*NL*
no
,
no
!
As
soon
as
it
was
made
plain
to
him
that
she
loved
him
and
called
*NL*
him
to
her
side
,
promising
him
new
happiness
,
oh
!
then
,
I
protest
he
must
*NL*
have
felt
the
impulse
to
suicide
doubled
,
trebled
,
and
must
have
killed
*NL*
himself
,
if
he
had
his
father
's
murder
on
his
conscience
.
Oh
,
no
!
he
would
*NL*
not
have
forgotten
where
his
pistols
lay
!
I
know
the
prisoner
:
the
savage
,
*NL*
stony
heartlessness
ascribed
to
him
by
the
prosecutor
is
inconsistent
with
*NL*
his
character
.
He
would
have
killed
himself
,
that
's
certain
.
He
did
not
*NL*
kill
himself
just
because
`
his
mother
's
prayers
had
saved
him
,
'
and
he
was
*NL*
innocent
of
his
father
's
blood
.
He
was
troubled
,
he
was
grieving
that
*NL*
night
at
Mokroe
only
about
old
Grigory
and
praying
to
God
that
the
old
man
*NL*
would
recover
,
that
his
blow
had
not
been
fatal
,
and
that
he
would
not
*NL*
have
to
suffer
for
it
.
Why
not
accept
such
an
interpretation
of
the
facts
?
*NL*
What
trustworthy
proof
have
we
that
the
prisoner
is
lying
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
shall
be
told
at
once
again
,
`
There
is
his
father
's
corpse
!
If
he
*NL*
ran
away
without
murdering
him
,
who
did
murder
him
?
'
Here
,
I
repeat
,
you
*NL*
have
the
whole
logic
of
the
prosecution
.
Who
murdered
him
,
if
not
he
?
*NL*
There
's
no
one
to
put
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
is
that
really
so
?
Is
it
positively
,
actually
true
*NL*
that
there
is
no
one
else
at
all
?
We
've
heard
the
prosecutor
count
on
his
*NL*
fingers
all
the
persons
who
were
in
that
house
that
night
.
They
were
five
*NL*
in
number
;
three
of
them
,
I
agree
,
could
not
have
been
responsible
--
the
*NL*
murdered
man
himself
,
old
Grigory
,
and
his
wife
.
There
are
left
then
the
*NL*
prisoner
and
Smerdyakov
,
and
the
prosecutor
dramatically
exclaims
that
the
*NL*
prisoner
pointed
to
Smerdyakov
because
he
had
no
one
else
to
fix
on
,
that
*NL*
had
there
been
a
sixth
person
,
even
a
phantom
of
a
sixth
person
,
he
would
*NL*
have
abandoned
the
charge
against
Smerdyakov
at
once
in
shame
and
have
*NL*
accused
that
other
.
But
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
why
may
I
not
draw
the
*NL*
very
opposite
conclusion
?
There
are
two
persons
--
the
prisoner
and
*NL*
Smerdyakov
.
Why
can
I
not
say
that
you
accuse
my
client
,
simply
because
*NL*
you
have
no
one
else
to
accuse
?
And
you
have
no
one
else
only
because
you
*NL*
have
determined
to
exclude
Smerdyakov
from
all
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
indeed
,
Smerdyakov
is
accused
only
by
the
prisoner
,
his
two
*NL*
brothers
,
and
Madame
Svyetlov
.
But
there
are
others
who
accuse
him
:
there
*NL*
are
vague
rumors
of
a
question
,
of
a
suspicion
,
an
obscure
report
,
a
*NL*
feeling
of
expectation
.
Finally
,
we
have
the
evidence
of
a
combination
of
*NL*
facts
very
suggestive
,
though
,
I
admit
,
inconclusive
.
In
the
first
place
*NL*
we
have
precisely
on
the
day
of
the
catastrophe
that
fit
,
for
the
*NL*
genuineness
of
which
the
prosecutor
,
for
some
reason
,
has
felt
obliged
to
*NL*
make
a
careful
defense
.
Then
Smerdyakov
's
sudden
suicide
on
the
eve
of
the
*NL*
trial
.
Then
the
equally
startling
evidence
given
in
court
to-day
by
the
*NL*
elder
of
the
prisoner
's
brothers
,
who
had
believed
in
his
guilt
,
but
has
*NL*
to-day
produced
a
bundle
of
notes
and
proclaimed
Smerdyakov
as
the
*NL*
murderer
.
Oh
,
I
fully
share
the
court
's
and
the
prosecutor
's
conviction
*NL*
that
Ivan
Karamazov
is
suffering
from
brain
fever
,
that
his
statement
may
*NL*
really
be
a
desperate
effort
,
planned
in
delirium
,
to
save
his
brother
by
*NL*
throwing
the
guilt
on
the
dead
man
.
But
again
Smerdyakov
's
name
is
*NL*
pronounced
,
again
there
is
a
suggestion
of
mystery
.
There
is
something
*NL*
unexplained
,
incomplete
.
And
perhaps
it
may
one
day
be
explained
.
But
we
*NL*
wo
n't
go
into
that
now
.
Of
that
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
court
has
resolved
to
go
on
with
the
trial
,
but
,
meantime
,
I
might
*NL*
make
a
few
remarks
about
the
character-sketch
of
Smerdyakov
drawn
with
*NL*
subtlety
and
talent
by
the
prosecutor
.
But
while
I
admire
his
talent
I
*NL*
can
not
agree
with
him
.
I
have
visited
Smerdyakov
,
I
have
seen
him
and
*NL*
talked
to
him
,
and
he
made
a
very
different
impression
on
me
.
He
was
weak
*NL*
in
health
,
it
is
true
;
but
in
character
,
in
spirit
,
he
was
by
no
means
the
*NL*
weak
man
the
prosecutor
has
made
him
out
to
be
.
I
found
in
him
no
trace
of
*NL*
the
timidity
on
which
the
prosecutor
so
insisted
.
There
was
no
simplicity
*NL*
about
him
,
either
.
I
found
in
him
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
extreme
*NL*
mistrustfulness
concealed
under
a
mask
of
_
naivete
_
,
and
an
intelligence
*NL*
of
considerable
range
.
The
prosecutor
was
too
simple
in
taking
him
for
*NL*
weak-minded
.
He
made
a
very
definite
impression
on
me
:
I
left
him
with
the
*NL*
conviction
that
he
was
a
distinctly
spiteful
creature
,
excessively
*NL*
ambitious
,
vindictive
,
and
intensely
envious
.
I
made
some
inquiries
:
he
*NL*
resented
his
parentage
,
was
ashamed
of
it
,
and
would
clench
his
teeth
when
*NL*
he
remembered
that
he
was
the
son
of
`
stinking
Lizaveta
.
'
He
was
*NL*
disrespectful
to
the
servant
Grigory
and
his
wife
,
who
had
cared
for
him
*NL*
in
his
childhood
.
He
cursed
and
jeered
at
Russia
.
He
dreamed
of
going
to
*NL*
France
and
becoming
a
Frenchman
.
He
used
often
to
say
that
he
had
n't
the
*NL*
means
to
do
so
.
I
fancy
he
loved
no
one
but
himself
and
had
a
strangely
*NL*
high
opinion
of
himself
.
His
conception
of
culture
was
limited
to
good
*NL*
clothes
,
clean
shirt-fronts
and
polished
boots
.
Believing
himself
to
be
*NL*
the
illegitimate
son
of
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
-LRB-
there
is
evidence
of
this
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
might
well
have
resented
his
position
,
compared
with
that
of
his
master
's
*NL*
legitimate
sons
.
They
had
everything
,
he
nothing
.
They
had
all
the
rights
,
*NL*
they
had
the
inheritance
,
while
he
was
only
the
cook
.
He
told
me
himself
*NL*
that
he
had
helped
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
to
put
the
notes
in
the
envelope
.
The
*NL*
destination
of
that
sum
--
a
sum
which
would
have
made
his
career
--
must
have
*NL*
been
hateful
to
him
.
Moreover
,
he
saw
three
thousand
roubles
in
new
*NL*
rainbow-colored
notes
.
-LRB-
I
asked
him
about
that
on
purpose
.
-RRB-
Oh
,
beware
of
*NL*
showing
an
ambitious
and
envious
man
a
large
sum
of
money
at
once
!
And
it
*NL*
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
so
much
money
in
the
hands
of
one
man
.
The
*NL*
sight
of
the
rainbow-colored
notes
may
have
made
a
morbid
impression
on
*NL*
his
imagination
,
but
with
no
immediate
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
talented
prosecutor
,
with
extraordinary
subtlety
,
sketched
for
us
all
*NL*
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
hypothesis
of
Smerdyakov
's
guilt
,
and
*NL*
asked
us
in
particular
what
motive
he
had
in
feigning
a
fit
.
But
he
may
*NL*
not
have
been
feigning
at
all
,
the
fit
may
have
happened
quite
naturally
,
*NL*
but
it
may
have
passed
off
quite
naturally
,
and
the
sick
man
may
have
*NL*
recovered
,
not
completely
perhaps
,
but
still
regaining
consciousness
,
as
*NL*
happens
with
epileptics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prosecutor
asks
at
what
moment
could
Smerdyakov
have
committed
the
*NL*
murder
.
But
it
is
very
easy
to
point
out
that
moment
.
He
might
have
waked
*NL*
up
from
deep
sleep
-LRB-
for
he
was
only
asleep
--
an
epileptic
fit
is
always
*NL*
followed
by
a
deep
sleep
-RRB-
at
that
moment
when
the
old
Grigory
shouted
at
*NL*
the
top
of
his
voice
`
Parricide
!
'
That
shout
in
the
dark
and
stillness
may
*NL*
have
waked
Smerdyakov
whose
sleep
may
have
been
less
sound
at
the
moment
:
*NL*
he
might
naturally
have
waked
up
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Getting
out
of
bed
,
he
goes
almost
unconsciously
and
with
no
definite
*NL*
motive
towards
the
sound
to
see
what
's
the
matter
.
His
head
is
still
*NL*
clouded
with
his
attack
,
his
faculties
are
half
asleep
;
but
,
once
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
he
walks
to
the
lighted
windows
and
he
hears
terrible
news
from
*NL*
his
master
,
who
would
be
,
of
course
,
glad
to
see
him
.
His
mind
sets
to
*NL*
work
at
once
.
He
hears
all
the
details
from
his
frightened
master
,
and
*NL*
gradually
in
his
disordered
brain
there
shapes
itself
an
idea
--
terrible
,
*NL*
but
seductive
and
irresistibly
logical
.
To
kill
the
old
man
,
take
the
*NL*
three
thousand
,
and
throw
all
the
blame
on
to
his
young
master
.
A
terrible
*NL*
lust
of
money
,
of
booty
,
might
seize
upon
him
as
he
realized
his
security
*NL*
from
detection
.
Oh
!
these
sudden
and
irresistible
impulses
come
so
often
*NL*
when
there
is
a
favorable
opportunity
,
and
especially
with
murderers
who
*NL*
have
had
no
idea
of
committing
a
murder
beforehand
.
And
Smerdyakov
may
*NL*
have
gone
in
and
carried
out
his
plan
.
With
what
weapon
?
Why
,
with
any
*NL*
stone
picked
up
in
the
garden
.
But
what
for
,
with
what
object
?
Why
,
the
*NL*
three
thousand
which
means
a
career
for
him
.
Oh
,
I
am
not
contradicting
*NL*
myself
--
the
money
may
have
existed
.
And
perhaps
Smerdyakov
alone
knew
where
*NL*
to
find
it
,
where
his
master
kept
it
.
And
the
covering
of
the
money
--
the
*NL*
torn
envelope
on
the
floor
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
,
when
the
prosecutor
was
explaining
his
subtle
theory
that
only
*NL*
an
inexperienced
thief
like
Karamazov
would
have
left
the
envelope
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
and
not
one
like
Smerdyakov
,
who
would
have
avoided
leaving
a
piece
*NL*
of
evidence
against
himself
,
I
thought
as
I
listened
that
I
was
hearing
*NL*
something
very
familiar
,
and
,
would
you
believe
it
,
I
have
heard
that
very
*NL*
argument
,
that
very
conjecture
,
of
how
Karamazov
would
have
behaved
,
*NL*
precisely
two
days
before
,
from
Smerdyakov
himself
.
What
's
more
,
it
struck
*NL*
me
at
the
time
.
I
fancied
that
there
was
an
artificial
simplicity
about
*NL*
him
;
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
suggest
this
idea
to
me
that
I
might
fancy
*NL*
it
was
my
own
.
He
insinuated
it
,
as
it
were
.
Did
he
not
insinuate
the
same
*NL*
idea
at
the
inquiry
and
suggest
it
to
the
talented
prosecutor
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
asked
,
`
What
about
the
old
woman
,
Grigory
's
wife
?
She
heard
*NL*
the
sick
man
moaning
close
by
,
all
night
.
'
Yes
,
she
heard
it
,
but
that
*NL*
evidence
is
extremely
unreliable
.
I
knew
a
lady
who
complained
bitterly
*NL*
that
she
had
been
kept
awake
all
night
by
a
dog
in
the
yard
.
Yet
the
poor
*NL*
beast
,
it
appeared
,
had
only
yelped
once
or
twice
in
the
night
.
And
that
's
*NL*
natural
.
If
any
one
is
asleep
and
hears
a
groan
he
wakes
up
,
annoyed
at
*NL*
being
waked
,
but
instantly
falls
asleep
again
.
Two
hours
later
,
again
a
*NL*
groan
,
he
wakes
up
and
falls
asleep
again
;
and
the
same
thing
again
two
*NL*
hours
later
--
three
times
altogether
in
the
night
.
Next
morning
the
sleeper
*NL*
wakes
up
and
complains
that
some
one
has
been
groaning
all
night
and
*NL*
keeping
him
awake
.
And
it
is
bound
to
seem
so
to
him
:
the
intervals
of
two
*NL*
hours
of
sleep
he
does
not
remember
,
he
only
remembers
the
moments
of
*NL*
waking
,
so
he
feels
he
has
been
waked
up
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
why
,
asks
the
prosecutor
,
did
not
Smerdyakov
confess
in
his
last
*NL*
letter
?
Why
did
his
conscience
prompt
him
to
one
step
and
not
to
both
?
*NL*
But
,
excuse
me
,
conscience
implies
penitence
,
and
the
suicide
may
not
have
*NL*
felt
penitence
,
but
only
despair
.
Despair
and
penitence
are
two
very
*NL*
different
things
.
Despair
may
be
vindictive
and
irreconcilable
,
and
the
*NL*
suicide
,
laying
his
hands
on
himself
,
may
well
have
felt
redoubled
hatred
*NL*
for
those
whom
he
had
envied
all
his
life

inconceivable

Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
what
is
a
father
--
a
real
father
?
What
*NL*
is
the
meaning
of
that
great
word
?
What
is
the
great
idea
in
that
name
?
We
*NL*
have
just
indicated
in
part
what
a
true
father
is
and
what
he
ought
to
be
.
*NL*
In
the
case
in
which
we
are
now
so
deeply
occupied
and
over
which
our
*NL*
hearts
are
aching
--
in
the
present
case
,
the
father
,
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
*NL*
Karamazov
,
did
not
correspond
to
that
conception
of
a
father
to
which
we
*NL*
have
just
referred
.
That
's
the
misfortune
.
And
indeed
some
fathers
are
a
*NL*
misfortune
.
Let
us
examine
this
misfortune
rather
more
closely
:
we
must
*NL*
shrink
from
nothing
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
considering
the
importance
of
*NL*
the
decision
you
have
to
make
.
It
's
our
particular
duty
not
to
shrink
from
*NL*
any
idea
,
like
children
or
frightened
women
,
as
the
talented
prosecutor
*NL*
happily
expresses
it
.

*NL*
``
But
in
the
course
of
his
heated
speech
my
esteemed
opponent
-LRB-
and
he
was
*NL*
my
opponent
before
I
opened
my
lips
-RRB-
exclaimed
several
times
,
`
Oh
,
I
will
*NL*
not
yield
the
defense
of
the
prisoner
to
the
lawyer
who
has
come
down
from
*NL*
Petersburg
.
I
accuse
,
but
I
defend
also
!
'
He
exclaimed
that
several
times
,
*NL*
but
forgot
to
mention
that
if
this
terrible
prisoner
was
for
twenty-three
*NL*
years
so
grateful
for
a
mere
pound
of
nuts
given
him
by
the
only
man
who
*NL*
had
been
kind
to
him
,
as
a
child
in
his
father
's
house
,
might
not
such
a
*NL*
man
well
have
remembered
for
twenty-three
years
how
he
ran
in
his
father
's
*NL*
back-yard
,
`
without
boots
on
his
feet
and
with
his
little
trousers
hanging
*NL*
by
one
button
'
--
to
use
the
expression
of
the
kind-hearted
doctor
,
*NL*
Herzenstube
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
why
need
we
look
more
closely
at
this
*NL*
misfortune
,
why
repeat
what
we
all
know
already
?
What
did
my
client
meet
*NL*
with
when
he
arrived
here
,
at
his
father
's
house
,
and
why
depict
my
client
*NL*
as
a
heartless
egoist
and
monster
?
He
is
uncontrolled
,
he
is
wild
and
*NL*
unruly
--
we
are
trying
him
now
for
that
--
but
who
is
responsible
for
his
life
?
*NL*
Who
is
responsible
for
his
having
received
such
an
unseemly
bringing
up
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
his
excellent
disposition
and
his
grateful
and
sensitive
*NL*
heart
?
Did
any
one
train
him
to
be
reasonable
?
Was
he
enlightened
by
*NL*
study
?
Did
any
one
love
him
ever
so
little
in
his
childhood
?
My
client
was
*NL*
left
to
the
care
of
Providence
like
a
beast
of
the
field
.
He
thirsted
*NL*
perhaps
to
see
his
father
after
long
years
of
separation
.
A
thousand
times
*NL*
perhaps
he
may
,
recalling
his
childhood
,
have
driven
away
the
loathsome
*NL*
phantoms
that
haunted
his
childish
dreams
and
with
all
his
heart
he
may
*NL*
have
longed
to
embrace
and
to
forgive
his
father
!
And
what
awaited
him
?
He
*NL*
was
met
by
cynical
taunts
,
suspicions
and
wrangling
about
money
.
He
heard
*NL*
nothing
but
revolting
talk
and
vicious
precepts
uttered
daily
over
the
*NL*
brandy
,
and
at
last
he
saw
his
father
seducing
his
mistress
from
him
with
*NL*
his
own
money
.
Oh
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
that
was
cruel
and
revolting
!
*NL*
And
that
old
man
was
always
complaining
of
the
disrespect
and
cruelty
of
*NL*
his
son
.
He
slandered
him
in
society
,
injured
him
,
calumniated
him
,
bought
*NL*
up
his
unpaid
debts
to
get
him
thrown
into
prison

Gentlemen

jury

people
like
my
client
,
who
are
fierce

unruly

and
*NL*
uncontrolled
on
the
surface
,
are
sometimes
,
most
frequently
indeed
,
*NL*
exceedingly
tender-hearted
,
only
they
do
n't
express
it
.
Do
n't
laugh
,
do
n't
*NL*
laugh
at
my
idea
!
The
talented
prosecutor
laughed
mercilessly
just
now
at
*NL*
my
client
for
loving
Schiller
--
loving
the
sublime
and
beautiful
!
I
should
*NL*
not
have
laughed
at
that
in
his
place
.
Yes
,
such
natures
--
oh
,
let
me
speak
*NL*
in
defense
of
such
natures
,
so
often
and
so
cruelly
misunderstood
--
these
*NL*
natures
often
thirst
for
tenderness
,
goodness
,
and
justice
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
contrast
to
themselves

their
unruliness

ferocity

they
thirst
for
*NL*
it
unconsciously

Passionate
and
fierce
on
the
surface

they
are
painfully
*NL*
capable
of
loving
woman

for

with
a
spiritual
and
elevated
*NL*
love

Again
do
not
laugh
at
me

this
is
very
often
the
case
in
such
*NL*
natures

But
they
can
not
hide
their
passions

sometimes
very
coarse
--
and
*NL*
that
is
conspicuous
and
is
noticed
,
but
the
inner
man
is
unseen

Their
*NL*
passions
are
quickly
exhausted
;
but
,
by
the
side
of
a
noble
and
lofty
*NL*
creature
that
seemingly
coarse
and
rough
man
seeks
a
new
life
,
seeks
to
*NL*
correct
himself

to
be
better

to
become
noble

honorable

sublime

beautiful

much
the
expression
has
been
ridiculed

I
may
say
half
a
word

What
we
heard
just
now
was
not
*NL*
evidence
,
but
only
the
scream
of
a
frenzied
and
revengeful
woman

and
it
*NL*
was
not

--
oh

not
for
her

--
to
reproach
him
with
treachery

she
*NL*
has
betrayed
him
!
If
she
had
had
but
a
little
time
for
reflection
she
*NL*

not
have
given
such
evidence

Oh

a

But
one
must
use
words
honestly

gentlemen

I
venture
to
call
things
by
their

such
a
father

not

does

an

No

But
as

I
make
my

appeal

We
are
not

we
are

all
together
to
say
a
good
word
to
each

That
's
what
I
am
doing

take
advantage

I

cry
aloud

Yes

us

first
fulfill
Christ

injunction
ourselves

only
then
venture
to

expect
it

Otherwise
we
are
not

enemies

Not
long
ago
a
servant
girl
in
Finland
was
suspected
of
having
secretly
*NL*
given
birth
to
a
child
.
She
was
watched
,
and
a
box
of
which
no
one
knew
*NL*
anything
was
found
in
the
corner
of
the
loft
,
behind
some
bricks
.
It
was
*NL*
opened
and
inside
was
found
the
body
of
a
new-born
child
which
she
had
*NL*
killed
.
In
the
same
box
were
found
the
skeletons
of
two
other
babies
*NL*
which
,
according
to
her
own
confession
,
she
had
killed
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
their
birth
.

*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury

was
she
a
mother

her
children

She
gave
birth

was
she
a
mother
to
them

Would
any
one
venture

Let

be

audacious
even
:
it

our
duty
to
be
so
at
this
moment

not
to
be
afraid
*NL*
of
certain
words
and
ideas
like
the
Moscow
women
in
Ostrovsky
's
play
,
who
*NL*
are
scared
at
the
sound
of
certain
words

No
,
let
us
prove
that
the
*NL*
progress
of
the
last
few
years
has
touched
even
us
,
and
let
us
say
*NL*
plainly
,
the
father
is
not
merely
he
who
begets
the
child
,
but
he
who
*NL*
begets
it
and
does
his
duty
by
it

*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
,
there
is
the
other
meaning
,
there
is
the
other
*NL*
interpretation
of
the
word
`
father
,
'
which
insists
that
any
father
,
even
*NL*
though
he
be
a
monster
,
even
though
he
be
the
enemy
of
his
children
,
still
*NL*
remains
my
father
simply
because
he
begot
me
.
But
this
is
,
so
to
say
,
the
*NL*
mystical
meaning
which
I
can
not
comprehend
with
my
intellect
,
but
can
only
*NL*
accept
by
faith
,
or
,
better
to
say
,
_
on
faith
_
,
like
many
other
things
*NL*
which
I
do
not
understand
,
but
which
religion
bids
me
believe
.
But
in
that
*NL*
case
let
it
be
kept
outside
the
sphere
of
actual
life

In
the
sphere
of
*NL*
actual
life

which
has
,
indeed

its
own
rights

also
lays
upon
us
*NL*
great
duties

obligations
,
in
that
sphere

if
we
want
to
be
*NL*
humane
--
Christian
,
in
fact
--
we
must

or
ought
to
,
act
only
upon
convictions
*NL*
justified
by
reason
and
experience
,
which
have
been
passed
through
the
*NL*
crucible
of
analysis

in
a
word

we
must
act
rationally

not
as
though
*NL*
in

and
delirium
,
that
we
may
not
do
harm
,
that
we
may
not
ill-treat
*NL*
and
ruin
a

waved
his

imploring

our

up

avoid
such
questions
?
No

they
can
not
,
and
we
will
not
impose
*NL*
on
them
an
impossible
restriction

The
sight
of
an
unworthy
father
*NL*
involuntarily
suggests
tormenting
questions
to
a
young
creature
,
*NL*
especially
when
he
compares
him
with
the
excellent
fathers
of
his
*NL*
companions
.
The
conventional
answer
to
this
question
is
:
`
He
begot
you
,
*NL*
and
you
are
his
flesh
and
blood
,
and
therefore
you
are
bound
to
love
him

The
youth
involuntarily
reflects
:
`
But
did
he
love
me
when
he
begot
me

*NL*
he
asks
,
wondering
more
and
more
.
`
Was
it
for
my

begot
me

He
did

not
know

not

my
sex
,
at
that
moment
,
at
the
moment
of
passion
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
inflamed
by
wine
,
and
he
has
only
transmitted
to
me
a
propensity
*NL*
to
drunkenness

that
's
all
he
's
done
for
me

Why
am
I
bound
to
love
him

simply
for
begetting
me
when
he
has
cared
nothing
for
me
all
my
life
*NL*
after
?

*NL*
``
Oh

perhaps
those
questions
strike
you
as
coarse

cruel

not

shall
it
be

stand
before

ask
him

me
,
why
must
I
love
you

show
me
that
I

love
you

and
if
*NL*
that
father
is
able
to
answer
him
and
show
him
good
reason
,
we
have
a
*NL*
real

normal

parental
relation
,
not
resting
on
mystical
prejudice
,
but
on
*NL*
a
rational
,
responsible
and
strictly
humanitarian
basis
.
But
if
he
does
*NL*
not
,
there
's
an
end
to
the
family
tie
.
He
is
not
a
father
to
him

and
the
*NL*
son

a
right
to
look

even

almost
frantic
*NL*
applause
.
Of
course
,
it
was
not
the
whole
audience
,
but
a
good
half
of
it
*NL*
applauded
.
The
fathers
and
mothers
present
applauded
.
Shrieks
and
*NL*
exclamations
were
heard
from
the
gallery
,
where
the
ladies
were
sitting
.
*NL*
Handkerchiefs
were
waved
.
The
President
began
ringing
his
bell
with
all
*NL*
his
might
.
He
was
obviously
irritated
by
the
behavior
of
the
audience
,
but
*NL*
did
not
venture
to
clear
the
court
as
he
had
threatened
.
Even
persons
of
*NL*
high
position
,
old
men
with
stars
on
their
breasts
,
sitting
on
specially
*NL*
reserved
seats
behind
the
judges
,
applauded
the
orator
and
waved
their
*NL*
handkerchiefs
.
So
that
when
the
noise
died
down
,
the
President
confined
*NL*
himself
to
repeating
his
stern
threat
to
clear
the
court
,
and
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
,
excited
and
triumphant
,
continued
his
speech
.

``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
you
remember
that
awful
night
of
which
so
much
has
*NL*
been
said
to-day
,
when
the
son
got
over
the
fence
and
stood
face
to
face
*NL*
with
the
enemy
and
persecutor
who
had
begotten
him
.
I
insist
most
*NL*
emphatically
it
was
not
for
money
he
ran
to
his
father
's
house
:
the
charge
*NL*
of
robbery
is
an
absurdity
,
as
I
proved
before
.
And
it
was
not
to
murder
*NL*
him
he
broke
into
the
house
,
oh
,
no
!
If
he
had
had
that
design
he
would
,
*NL*
at
least
,
have
taken
the
precaution
of
arming
himself
beforehand
.
The
*NL*
brass
pestle
he
caught
up
instinctively
without
knowing
why
he
did
it
.
*NL*
Granted
that
he
deceived
his
father
by
tapping
at
the
window
,
granted
that
*NL*
he
made
his
way
in
--
I
've
said
already
that
I
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
*NL*
that
legend
,
but
let
it
be
so
,
let
us
suppose
it
for
a
moment
.
Gentlemen
,
*NL*
I
swear
to
you
by
all
that
's
holy
,
if
it
had
not
been
his
father
,
but
an
*NL*
ordinary
enemy
,
he
would
,
after
running
through
the
rooms
and
satisfying
*NL*
himself
that
the
woman
was
not
there
,
have
made
off
,
post-haste
,
without
*NL*
doing
any
harm
to
his
rival
.
He
would
have
struck
him
,
pushed
him
away
*NL*
perhaps
,
nothing
more
,
for
he
had
no
thought
and
no
time
to
spare
for
*NL*
that
.
What
he
wanted
to
know
was
where
she
was
.
But
his
father
,
his
*NL*
father
!
The
mere
sight
of
the
father
who
had
hated
him
from
his
childhood
,
*NL*
had
been
his
enemy
,
his
persecutor
,
and
now
his
unnatural
rival
,
was
*NL*
enough
!
A
feeling
of
hatred
came
over
him
involuntarily
,
irresistibly
,
*NL*
clouding
his
reason
.
It
all
surged
up
in
one
moment
!
It
was
an
impulse
of
*NL*
madness
and
insanity
,
but
also
an
impulse
of
nature
,
irresistibly
and
*NL*
unconsciously
-LRB-
like
everything
in
nature
-RRB-
avenging
the
violation
of
its
*NL*
eternal
laws
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
prisoner
even
then
did
not
murder
him
--
I
maintain
that
,
I
cry
that
*NL*
aloud
!
--
no
,
he
only
brandished
the
pestle
in
a
burst
of
indignant
disgust
,
*NL*
not
meaning
to
kill
him
,
not
knowing
that
he
would
kill
him
.
Had
he
not
*NL*
had
this
fatal
pestle
in
his
hand
,
he
would
have
only
knocked
his
father
*NL*
down
perhaps
,
but
would
not
have
killed
him
.
As
he
ran
away
,
he
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
he
had
killed
the
old
man
.
Such
a
murder
is
not
a
murder
.
*NL*
Such
a
murder
is
not
a
parricide
.
No
,
the
murder
of
such
a
father
can
not
*NL*
be
called
parricide
.
Such
a
murder
can
only
be
reckoned
parricide
by
*NL*
prejudice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
appeal
to
you
again
and
again
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
;
did
this
*NL*
murder
actually
take
place
?
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
if
we
convict
and
*NL*
punish
him
,
he
will
say
to
himself
:
`
These
people
have
done
nothing
for
my
*NL*
bringing
up
,
for
my
education
,
nothing
to
improve
my
lot
,
nothing
to
make
*NL*
me
better
,
nothing
to
make
me
a
man
.
These
people
have
not
given
me
to
eat
*NL*
and
to
drink
,
have
not
visited
me
in
prison
and
nakedness
,
and
here
they
*NL*
have
sent
me
to
penal
servitude
.
I
am
quits
,
I
owe
them
nothing
now
,
and
*NL*
owe
no
one
anything
for
ever
.
They
are
wicked
and
I
will
be
wicked
.
They
*NL*
are
cruel
and
I
will
be
cruel
.
'
That
is
what
he
will
say
,
gentlemen
of
the
*NL*
jury
.
And
I
swear
,
by
finding
him
guilty
you
will
only
make
it
easier
for
*NL*
him
:
you
will
ease
his
conscience
,
he
will
curse
the
blood
he
has
shed
and
*NL*
will
not
regret
it
.
At
the
same
time
you
will
destroy
in
him
the
*NL*
possibility
of
becoming
a
new
man
,
for
he
will
remain
in
his
wickedness
*NL*
and
blindness
all
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
want
to
punish
him
fearfully
,
terribly
,
with
the
most
awful
*NL*
punishment
that
could
be
imagined
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
save
him
and
*NL*
regenerate
his
soul
?
If
so
,
overwhelm
him
with
your
mercy
!
You
will
see
,
*NL*
you
will
hear
how
he
will
tremble
and
be
horror-struck
.
`
How
can
I
endure
*NL*
this
mercy
?
How
can
I
endure
so
much
love
?
Am
I
worthy
of
it

That
's
what
*NL*
he
will
exclaim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know

I
know
that
heart

that
wild

grateful
heart

It
will
bow
before
your
mercy
;
it
thirsts
for
a
great
and
loving
*NL*
action
,
it
will
melt
and
mount
upwards
.
There
are
souls
which
,
in
their
*NL*
limitation
,
blame
the
whole
world
.
But
subdue
such
a
soul
with
mercy
,
show
*NL*
it
love
,
and
it
will
curse
its
past
,
for
there
are
many
good
impulses
in
*NL*
it
.
Such
a
heart
will
expand
and
see
that
God
is
merciful
and
that
men
are
*NL*
good
and
just

He
will
be
horror-stricken
;
he
will
be
crushed
by
remorse

the
vast
obligation
laid
upon
him
henceforth

And
he
will
not

*NL*
then

I

quits

will
say
,
'
I
am
guilty
in
the
sight

*NL*
am
more
unworthy
than
all
.

With
tears
of
penitence
and
poignant
,
tender
*NL*
anguish
,
he
will
exclaim
:
`
Others
are
better
than
I
,
they
wanted
to
save
*NL*
me
,
not
to
ruin
me
!
'
Oh
,
this
act
of
mercy
is
so
easy
for
you
,
for
in
the
*NL*
absence
of
anything
like
real
evidence
it
will
be
too
awful
for
you
to
*NL*
pronounce
:
`
Yes
,
he
is
guilty
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
acquit
ten
guilty
men

Do
you
hear

do
you
hear
that
majestic
voice
from
the
past
century
of
our
glorious
*NL*
history
?
It
is
not
for
an
insignificant
person
like
me
to
remind
you
that
*NL*
the
Russian
court
does
not
exist
for
the
punishment
only
,
but
also
for
the
*NL*
salvation

Let

think
of
retribution
and
the

letter

,
we
will
cling
to
the
spirit
and
the
meaning
--
the

salvation

the
reformation
of
the
lost

If
this
is
true

if
Russia
and

her
justice
are
such
,
she
may
go
forward

good

frenzied

Not
a

the
stately
chariot
of
Russia

move
calmly

its

the
fate

The
Peasants
Stand
Firm
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
how
Fetyukovitch
concluded
his
speech
,
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
*NL*
audience
burst
like
an
irresistible
storm
.
It
was
out
of
the
question
to
*NL*
stop
it
:
the
women
wept
,
many
of
the
men
wept
too
,
even
two
important
*NL*
personages
shed
tears
.
The
President
submitted
,
and
even
postponed
ringing
*NL*
his
bell
.
The
suppression
of
such
an
enthusiasm
would
be
the
suppression
*NL*
of
something
sacred
,
as
the
ladies
cried
afterwards
.
The
orator
himself
*NL*
was
genuinely
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
at
this
moment
that
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
got
up
to
make
certain
*NL*
objections
.
People
looked
at
him
with
hatred
.
``
What
?
What
's
the
meaning
of
*NL*
it
?
He
positively
dares
to
make
objections
,
''
the
ladies
babbled
.
But
if
*NL*
the
whole
world
of
ladies
,
including
his
wife
,
had
protested
he
could
not
*NL*
have
been
stopped
at
that
moment
.
He
was
pale
,
he
was
shaking
with
*NL*
emotion
,
his
first
phrases
were
even
unintelligible
,
he
gasped
for
breath
,
*NL*
could
hardly
speak
clearly
,
lost
the
thread
.
But
he
soon
recovered
*NL*
himself
.
Of
this
new
speech
of
his
I
will
quote
only
a
few
sentences
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
I
am
reproached
with
having
woven
a
romance
.
But
what
is
this
defense
*NL*
if
not
one
romance
on
the
top
of
another
?
All
that
was
lacking
was
poetry
.
*NL*
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
,
while
waiting
for
his
mistress
,
tears
open
the
envelope
*NL*
and
throws
it
on
the
floor
.
We
are
even
told
what
he
said
while
engaged
in
*NL*
this
strange
act
.
Is
not
this
a
flight
of
fancy
?
And
what
proof
have
we
*NL*
that
he
had
taken
out
the
money
?
Who
heard
what
he
said
?
The
weak-minded
*NL*
idiot
,
Smerdyakov
,
transformed
into
a
Byronic
hero
,
avenging
society
for
*NL*
his
illegitimate
birth
--
is
n't
this
a
romance
in
the
Byronic
style
?
And
the
*NL*
son
who
breaks
into
his
father
's
house
and
murders
him
without
murdering
*NL*
him
is
not
even
a
romance
--
this
is
a
sphinx
setting
us
a
riddle
which
he
*NL*
can
not
solve
himself
.
If
he
murdered
him
,
he
murdered
him
,
and
what
's
the
*NL*
meaning
of
his
murdering
him
without
having
murdered
him
--
who
can
make
head
*NL*
or
tail
of
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
are
admonished
that
our
tribune
is
a
tribune
of
true
and
sound
*NL*
ideas
and
from
this
tribune
of
`
sound
ideas
'
is
heard
a
solemn
declaration
*NL*
that
to
call
the
murder
of
a
father
`
parricide
'
is
nothing
but
a
*NL*
prejudice
!
But
if
parricide
is
a
prejudice
,
and
if
every
child
is
to
ask
*NL*
his
father
why
he
is
to
love
him
,
what
will
become
of
us
?
What
will
become
*NL*
of
the
foundations
of
society
?
What
will
become
of
the
family
?
Parricide
,
*NL*
it
appears
,
is
only
a
bogy
of
Moscow
merchants
'
wives
.
The
most
precious
,
*NL*
the
most
sacred
guarantees
for
the
destiny
and
future
of
Russian
justice
*NL*
are
presented
to
us
in
a
perverted
and
frivolous
form
,
simply
to
attain
an
*NL*
object
--
to
obtain
the
justification
of
something
which
can
not
be
justified
.
*NL*
`
Oh
,
crush
him
by
mercy
,
'
cries
the
counsel
for
the
defense
;
but
that
's
*NL*
all
the
criminal
wants
,
and
to-morrow
it
will
be
seen
how
much
he
is
*NL*
crushed
.
And
is
not
the
counsel
for
the
defense
too
modest
in
asking
only
*NL*
for
the
acquittal
of
the
prisoner
?
Why
not
found
a
charity
in
the
honor
of
*NL*
the
parricide
to
commemorate
his
exploit
among
future
generations
?
*NL*
Religion
and
the
Gospel
are
corrected
--
that
's
all
mysticism
,
we
are
told
,
*NL*
and
ours
is
the
only
true
Christianity
which
has
been
subjected
to
the
*NL*
analysis
of
reason
and
common
sense
.
And
so
they
set
up
before
us
a
false
*NL*
semblance
of
Christ
!
`
What
measure
ye
mete
so
it
shall
be
meted
unto
you
*NL*
again
,
'
cried
the
counsel
for
the
defense
,
and
instantly
deduces
that
*NL*
Christ
teaches
us
to
measure
as
it
is
measured
to
us
--
and
this
from
the
*NL*
tribune
of
truth
and
sound
sense
!
We
peep
into
the
Gospel
only
on
the
eve
*NL*
of
making
speeches
,
in
order
to
dazzle
the
audience
by
our
acquaintance
*NL*
with
what
is
,
anyway
,
a
rather
original
composition
,
which
may
be
of
use
*NL*
to
produce
a
certain
effect
--
all
to
serve
the
purpose
!
But
what
Christ
*NL*
commands
us
is
something
very
different
:
He
bids
us
beware
of
doing
this
,
*NL*
because
the
wicked
world
does
this
,
but
we
ought
to
forgive
and
to
turn
*NL*
the
other
cheek
,
and
not
to
measure
to
our
persecutors
as
they
measure
to
*NL*
us
.
This
is
what
our
God
has
taught
us
and
not
that
to
forbid
children
to
*NL*
murder
their
fathers
is
a
prejudice
.
And
we
will
not
from
the
tribune
of
*NL*
truth
and
good
sense
correct
the
Gospel
of
our
Lord
,
Whom
the
counsel
for
*NL*
the
defense
deigns
to
call
only
`
the
crucified
lover
of
humanity
,
'
in
*NL*
opposition
to
all
orthodox
Russia
,
which
calls
to
Him
,
`
For
Thou
art
our
*NL*
God
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
President
intervened
and
checked
the
over-zealous
speaker
,
*NL*
begging
him
not
to
exaggerate
,
not
to
overstep
the
bounds
,
and
so
on
,
as
*NL*
presidents
always
do
in
such
cases
.
The
audience
,
too
,
was
uneasy
.
The
*NL*
public
was
restless
:
there
were
even
exclamations
of
indignation
.
*NL*
Fetyukovitch
did
not
so
much
as
reply
;
he
only
mounted
the
tribune
to
lay
*NL*
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
,
with
an
offended
voice
,
utter
a
few
words
full
*NL*
of
dignity
.
He
only
touched
again
,
lightly
and
ironically
,
on
``
romancing
''
*NL*
and
``
psychology
,
''
and
in
an
appropriate
place
quoted
,
``
Jupiter
,
you
are
*NL*
angry
,
therefore
you
are
wrong
,
''
which
provoked
a
burst
of
approving
*NL*
laughter
in
the
audience
,
for
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
was
by
no
means
like
*NL*
Jupiter
.
Then
,
_
a
propos
_
of
the
accusation
that
he
was
teaching
the
young
*NL*
generation
to
murder
their
fathers
,
Fetyukovitch
observed
,
with
great
*NL*
dignity
,
that
he
would
not
even
answer
.
As
for
the
prosecutor
's
charge
of
*NL*
uttering
unorthodox
opinions
,
Fetyukovitch
hinted
that
it
was
a
personal
*NL*
insinuation
and
that
he
had
expected
in
this
court
to
be
secure
from
*NL*
accusations
``
damaging
to
my
reputation
as
a
citizen
and
a
loyal
subject
.
''
*NL*
But
at
these
words
the
President
pulled
him
up
,
too
,
and
Fetyukovitch
*NL*
concluded
his
speech
with
a
bow
,
amid
a
hum
of
approbation
in
the
court
.
*NL*
And
Ippolit
Kirillovitch
was
,
in
the
opinion
of
our
ladies
,
``
crushed
for
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
prisoner
was
allowed
to
speak
.
Mitya
stood
up
,
but
said
very
*NL*
little
.
He
was
fearfully
exhausted
,
physically
and
mentally
.
The
look
of
*NL*
strength
and
independence
with
which
he
had
entered
in
the
morning
had
*NL*
almost
disappeared
.
He
seemed
as
though
he
had
passed
through
an
*NL*
experience
that
day
,
which
had
taught
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
*NL*
something
very
important
he
had
not
understood
till
then
.
His
voice
was
*NL*
weak
,
he
did
not
shout
as
before
.
In
his
words
there
was
a
new
note
of
*NL*
humility
,
defeat
and
submission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
say
,
gentlemen
of
the
jury
?
The
hour
of
judgment
has
come
*NL*
for
me
,
I
feel
the
hand
of
God
upon
me
!
The
end
has
come
to
an
erring
man
!
*NL*
But
,
before
God
,
I
repeat
to
you
,
I
am
innocent
of
my
father
's
blood
!
For
*NL*
the
last
time
I
repeat
,
it
was
n't
I
killed
him
!
I
was
erring
,
but
I
loved
*NL*
what
is
good
.
Every
instant
I
strove
to
reform
,
but
I
lived
like
a
wild
*NL*
beast
.
I
thank
the
prosecutor
,
he
told
me
many
things
about
myself
that
I
*NL*
did
not
know
;
but
it
's
not
true
that
I
killed
my
father
,
the
prosecutor
is
*NL*
mistaken
.
I
thank
my
counsel
,
too
.
I
cried
listening
to
him
;
but
it
's
not
*NL*
true
that
I
killed
my
father
,
and
he
need
n't
have
supposed
it
.
And
do
n't
*NL*
believe
the
doctors
.
I
am
perfectly
sane
,
only
my
heart
is
heavy
.
If
you
*NL*
spare
me
,
if
you
let
me
go
,
I
will
pray
for
you
.
I
will
be
a
better
man
.
I
*NL*
give
you
my
word
before
God
I
will
!
And
if
you
will
condemn
me
,
I
'll
break
*NL*
my
sword
over
my
head
myself
and
kiss
the
pieces
.
But
spare
me
,
do
not
rob
*NL*
me
of
my
God
!
I
know
myself
,
I
shall
rebel
!
My
heart
is
heavy
,
gentlemen
*NL*
...
spare
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
almost
fell
back
in
his
place
:
his
voice
broke
:
he
could
hardly
*NL*
articulate
the
last
phrase
.
Then
the
judges
proceeded
to
put
the
questions
*NL*
and
began
to
ask
both
sides
to
formulate
their
conclusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
will
not
describe
the
details
.
At
last
the
jury
rose
to
retire
for
*NL*
consultation
.
The
President
was
very
tired
,
and
so
his
last
charge
to
the
*NL*
jury
was
rather
feeble
.
``
Be
impartial
,
do
n't
be
influenced
by
the
*NL*
eloquence
of
the
defense
,
but
yet
weigh
the
arguments
.
Remember
that
there
*NL*
is
a
great
responsibility
laid
upon
you
,
''
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jury
withdrew
and
the
court
adjourned
.
People
could
get
up
,
move
*NL*
about
,
exchange
their
accumulated
impressions
,
refresh
themselves
at
the
*NL*
buffet
.
It
was
very
late
,
almost
one
o'clock
in
the
night
,
but
nobody
went
*NL*
away
:
the
strain
was
so
great
that
no
one
could
think
of
repose
.
All
*NL*
waited
with
sinking
hearts
;
though
that
is
,
perhaps
,
too
much
to
say
,
for
*NL*
the
ladies
were
only
in
a
state
of
hysterical
impatience
and
their
hearts
*NL*
were
untroubled
.
An
acquittal
,
they
thought
,
was
inevitable
.
They
all
*NL*
prepared
themselves
for
a
dramatic
moment
of
general
enthusiasm
.
I
must
*NL*
own
there
were
many
among
the
men
,
too
,
who
were
convinced
that
an
*NL*
acquittal
was
inevitable
.
Some
were
pleased
,
others
frowned
,
while
some
*NL*
were
simply
dejected
,
not
wanting
him
to
be
acquitted
.
Fetyukovitch
*NL*
himself
was
confident
of
his
success
.
He
was
surrounded
by
people
*NL*
congratulating
him
and
fawning
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
,
''
he
said
to
one
group
,
as
I
was
told
afterwards
,
``
there
are
*NL*
invisible
threads
binding
the
counsel
for
the
defense
with
the
jury
.
One
*NL*
feels
during
one
's
speech
if
they
are
being
formed
.
I
was
aware
of
them
.
*NL*
They
exist
.
Our
cause
is
won
.
Set
your
mind
at
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
our
peasants
say
now
?
''
said
one
stout
,
cross-looking
,
pock
-
*NL*
marked
gentleman
,
a
landowner
of
the
neighborhood
,
approaching
a
group
of
*NL*
gentlemen
engaged
in
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
are
not
all
peasants
.
There
are
four
government
clerks
among
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
are
clerks
,
''
said
a
member
of
the
district
council
,
joining
*NL*
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
that
Nazaryev
,
the
merchant
with
the
medal
,
a
juryman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
with
brains

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
never
speaks

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
no
great
talker
,
but
so
much
the
better

There
's
no
need
for
the
*NL*
Petersburg
man
to
teach
him
:
he
could
teach
all
Petersburg
himself
.
He
's
*NL*
the
father
of
twelve
children
.
Think
of
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
you
do
n't
suppose
they
wo
n't
acquit
him
?
''
one
of
our
young
*NL*
officials
exclaimed
in
another
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
acquit
him
for
certain
,
''
said
a
resolute
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
shameful

disgraceful

not

acquit
him

cried
the
*NL*
official
.
``
Suppose
he
did
murder
him

there
are
fathers

And
,
*NL*
besides

he
was
in
such
a
frenzy

He
really
may
have
done
nothing
but
*NL*
swing
the
pestle
in
the
air
,
and
so
knocked
the
old
man
down
.
But
it
was
a
*NL*
pity
they
dragged
the
valet
in
.
That
was
simply
an
absurd
theory
!
If
I
'd
*NL*
been
in
Fetyukovitch
's
place
,
I
should
simply
have
said
straight
out
:

murdered
him

he
is
not
guilty

hang

*NL*
*NL*

That

only
without

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mihail
Semyonovitch

he
almost
said

put
in
a
third
voice

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
But
the
bell
rang
.
The
jury
deliberated
for
exactly
an
hour
,
neither
more
*NL*
nor
less
.
A
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
court
as
soon
as
the
public
*NL*
had
taken
their
seats
.
I
remember
how
the
jurymen
walked
into
the
court
.
*NL*
At
last
!
I
wo
n't
repeat
the
questions
in
order
,
and
,
indeed
,
I
have
*NL*
forgotten
them
.
I
remember
only
the
answer
to
the
President
's
first
and
*NL*
chief
question
:
``
Did
the
prisoner
commit
the
murder
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
robbery
and
with
premeditation
?
''
-LRB-
I
do
n't
remember
the
exact
words
.
-RRB-
There
*NL*
was
a
complete
hush
.
The
foreman
of
the
jury
,
the
youngest
of
the
clerks
,
*NL*
pronounced
,
in
a
clear
,
loud
voice
,
amidst
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
*NL*
court
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
guilty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
same
answer
was
repeated
to
every
question
:
``
Yes
,
guilty
!
''
and
*NL*
without
the
slightest
extenuating
comment
.
This
no
one
had
expected
;
*NL*
almost
every
one
had
reckoned
upon
a
recommendation
to
mercy
,
at
least
.
*NL*
The
deathlike
silence
in
the
court
was
not
broken
--
all
seemed
petrified
:
*NL*
those
who
desired
his
conviction
as
well
as
those
who
had
been
eager
for
*NL*
his
acquittal
.
But
that
was
only
for
the
first
instant
,
and
it
was
*NL*
followed
by
a
fearful
hubbub
.
Many
of
the
men
in
the
audience
were
*NL*
pleased
.
Some
were
rubbing
their
hands
with
no
attempt
to
conceal
their
*NL*
joy
.
Those
who
disagreed
with
the
verdict
seemed
crushed
,
shrugged
their
*NL*
shoulders
,
whispered
,
but
still
seemed
unable
to
realize
this
.
But
how
*NL*
shall
I
describe
the
state
the
ladies
were
in
?
I
thought
they
would
create
*NL*
a
riot
.
At
first
they
could
scarcely
believe
their
ears
.
Then
suddenly
the
*NL*
whole
court
rang
with
exclamations
:
``
What
's
the
meaning
of
it
?
What
next
?
''
*NL*
They
leapt
up
from
their
places
.
They
seemed
to
fancy
that
it
might
be
at
*NL*
once
reconsidered
and
reversed
.
At
that
instant
Mitya
suddenly
stood
up
*NL*
and
cried
in
a
heartrending
voice
,
stretching
his
hands
out
before
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
by
God
and
the
dreadful
Day
of
Judgment
I
am
not
guilty
of
my
*NL*
father
's
blood
!
Katya
,
I
forgive
you
!
Brothers
,
friends
,
have
pity
on
the
*NL*
other
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
go
on
,
and
broke
into
a
terrible
sobbing
wail
that
was
heard
*NL*
all
over
the
court
in
a
strange
,
unnatural
voice
unlike
his
own
.
From
the
*NL*
farthest
corner
at
the
back
of
the
gallery
came
a
piercing
shriek
--
it
was
*NL*
Grushenka
.
She
had
succeeded
in
begging
admittance
to
the
court
again
*NL*
before
the
beginning
of
the
lawyers
'
speeches
.
Mitya
was
taken
away
.
The
*NL*
passing
of
the
sentence
was
deferred
till
next
day
.
The
whole
court
was
in
*NL*
a
hubbub
but
I
did
not
wait
to
hear
.
I
only
remember
a
few
exclamations
I
*NL*
heard
on
the
steps
as
I
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
have
a
twenty
years

trip
to
the
mines

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Chapter

Plans
For
Mitya
's
Escape
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Very
early
,
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
five
days
after
the
trial
,
*NL*
Alyosha
went
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
to
talk
over
a
matter
of
great
*NL*
importance
to
both
of
them
,
and
to
give
her
a
message
.
She
sat
and
talked
*NL*
to
him
in
the
very
room
in
which
she
had
once
received
Grushenka
.
In
the
*NL*
next
room
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
lay
unconscious
in
a
high
fever
.
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
had
immediately
after
the
scene
at
the
trial
ordered
the
sick
and
*NL*
unconscious
man
to
be
carried
to
her
house
,
disregarding
the
inevitable
*NL*
gossip
and
general
disapproval
of
the
public
.
One
of
the
two
relations
who
*NL*
lived
with
her
had
departed
to
Moscow
immediately
after
the
scene
in
*NL*
court
,
the
other
remained
.
But
if
both
had
gone
away
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
would
have
adhered
to
her
resolution
,
and
would
have
gone
on
nursing
the
*NL*
sick
man
and
sitting
by
him
day
and
night
.
Varvinsky
and
Herzenstube
were
*NL*
attending
him
.
The
famous
doctor
had
gone
back
to
Moscow
,
refusing
to
give
*NL*
an
opinion
as
to
the
probable
end
of
the
illness
.
Though
the
doctors
*NL*
encouraged
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
Alyosha
,
it
was
evident
that
they
could
*NL*
not
yet
give
them
positive
hopes
of
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
came
to
see
his
sick
brother
twice
a
day
.
But
this
time
he
had
*NL*
specially
urgent
business
,
and
he
foresaw
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
*NL*
approach
the
subject
,
yet
he
was
in
great
haste
.
He
had
another
engagement
*NL*
that
could
not
be
put
off
for
that
same
morning
,
and
there
was
need
of
*NL*
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
talking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
pale
*NL*
and
terribly
fatigued
,
yet
at
the
same
time
in
a
state
of
hysterical
*NL*
excitement
.
She
had
a
presentiment
of
the
reason
why
Alyosha
had
come
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
about
his
decision
,
''
she
said
,
with
confident
emphasis
to
*NL*
Alyosha
.
``
One
way
or
another
he
is
bound
to
come
to
it
.
He
must
escape
.
*NL*
That
unhappy
man
,
that
hero
of
honor
and
principle
--
not
he
,
not
Dmitri
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
,
but
the
man
lying
the
other
side
of
that
door
,
who
has
*NL*
sacrificed
himself
for
his
brother
,
''
Katya
added
,
with
flashing
eyes
--
``
told
*NL*
me
the
whole
plan
of
escape
long
ago
.
You
know
he
has
already
entered
into
*NL*
negotiations
...
I
've
told
you
something
already
...
You
see
,
it
will
*NL*
probably
come
off
at
the
third
_
etape
_
from
here
,
when
the
party
of
*NL*
prisoners
is
being
taken
to
Siberia
.
Oh
,
it
's
a
long
way
off
yet
.
Ivan
*NL*
Fyodorovitch
has
already
visited
the
superintendent
of
the
third
_
etape
_
.
*NL*
But
we
do
n't
know
yet
who
will
be
in
charge
of
the
party
,
and
it
's
*NL*
impossible
to
find
that
out
so
long
beforehand
.
To-morrow
perhaps
I
will
*NL*
show
you
in
detail
the
whole
plan
which
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
left
me
on
the
*NL*
eve
of
the
trial
in
case
of
need
...
That
was
when
--
do
you
remember
?
--
you
*NL*
found
us
quarreling
.
He
had
just
gone
down-stairs
,
but
seeing
you
I
made
*NL*
him
come
back
;
do
you
remember
?
Do
you
know
what
we
were
quarreling
about
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
did
not
tell
you
.
It
was
about
that
plan
of
escape
.
He
had
*NL*
told
me
the
main
idea
three
days
before
,
and
we
began
quarreling
about
it
*NL*
at
once
and
quarreled
for
three
days
.
We
quarreled
because
,
when
he
told
*NL*
me
that
if
Dmitri
Fyodorovitch
were
convicted
he
would
escape
abroad
with
*NL*
that
creature
,
I
felt
furious
at
once
--
I
ca
n't
tell
you
why
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
myself
why
...
Oh
,
of
course
,
I
was
furious
then
about
that
creature
,
and
*NL*
that
she
,
too
,
should
go
abroad
with
Dmitri
!
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
exclaimed
*NL*
suddenly
,
her
lips
quivering
with
anger
.
``
As
soon
as
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
saw
*NL*
that
I
was
furious
about
that
woman
,
he
instantly
imagined
I
was
jealous
*NL*
of
Dmitri
and
that
I
still
loved
Dmitri
.
That
is
how
our
first
quarrel
*NL*
began
.
I
would
not
give
an
explanation
,
I
could
not
ask
forgiveness
.
I
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
think
that
such
a
man
could
suspect
me
of
still
loving
*NL*
that
...
and
when
I
myself
had
told
him
long
before
that
I
did
not
love
*NL*
Dmitri
,
that
I
loved
no
one
but
him
!
It
was
only
resentment
against
that
*NL*
creature
that
made
me
angry
with
him
.
Three
days
later
,
on
the
evening
you
*NL*
came
,
he
brought
me
a
sealed
envelope
,
which
I
was
to
open
at
once
,
if
*NL*
anything
happened
to
him
.
Oh
,
he
foresaw
his
illness
!
He
told
me
that
the
*NL*
envelope
contained
the
details
of
the
escape
,
and
that
if
he
died
or
was
*NL*
taken
dangerously
ill
,
I
was
to
save
Mitya
alone
.
Then
he
left
me
money
,
*NL*
nearly
ten
thousand
--
those
notes
to
which
the
prosecutor
referred
in
his
*NL*
speech
,
having
learnt
from
some
one
that
he
had
sent
them
to
be
changed
.
I
*NL*
was
tremendously
impressed
to
find
that
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
had
not
given
up
*NL*
his
idea
of
saving
his
brother
,
and
was
confiding
this
plan
of
escape
to
*NL*
me
,
though
he
was
still
jealous
of
me
and
still
convinced
that
I
loved
*NL*
Mitya
.
Oh
,
that
was
a
sacrifice
!
No
,
you
can
not
understand
the
greatness
*NL*
of
such
self-sacrifice
,
Alexey
Fyodorovitch
.
I
wanted
to
fall
at
his
feet
*NL*
in
reverence
,
but
I
thought
at
once
that
he
would
take
it
only
for
my
joy
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
Mitya
's
being
saved
-LRB-
and
he
certainly
would
have
*NL*
imagined
that
!
-RRB-
,
and
I
was
so
exasperated
at
the
mere
possibility
of
such
*NL*
an
unjust
thought
on
his
part
that
I
lost
my
temper
again
,
and
instead
of
*NL*
kissing
his
feet
,
flew
into
a
fury
again
!
Oh
,
I
am
unhappy
!
It
's
my
*NL*
character
,
my
awful
,
unhappy
character
!
Oh
,
you
will
see
,
I
shall
end
by
*NL*
driving
him
,
too
,
to
abandon
me
for
another
with
whom
he
can
get
on
*NL*
better
,
like
Dmitri
.
But
...
no
,
I
could
not
bear
it
,
I
should
kill
*NL*
myself
.
And
when
you
came
in
then
,
and
when
I
called
to
you
and
told
him
*NL*
to
come
back
,
I
was
so
enraged
by
the
look
of
contempt
and
hatred
he
*NL*
turned
on
me
that
--
do
you
remember
?
--
I
cried
out
to
you
that
it
was
he
,
he
*NL*
alone
who
had
persuaded
me
that
his
brother
Dmitri
was
a
murderer
!
I
said
*NL*
that
malicious
thing
on
purpose
to
wound
him
again
.
He
had
never
,
never
*NL*
persuaded
me
that
his
brother
was
a
murderer
.
On
the
contrary
,
it
was
I
*NL*
who
persuaded
him
!
Oh
,
my
vile
temper
was
the
cause
of
everything
!
I
paved
*NL*
the
way
to
that
hideous
scene
at
the
trial
.
He
wanted
to
show
me
that
he
*NL*
was
an
honorable
man
,
and
that
,
even
if
I
loved
his
brother
,
he
would
not
*NL*
ruin
him
for
revenge
or
jealousy
.
So
he
came
to
the
court
...
I
am
the
*NL*
cause
of
it
all
,
I
alone
am
to
blame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katya
never
had
made
such
confessions
to
Alyosha
before
,
and
he
felt
that
*NL*
she
was
now
at
that
stage
of
unbearable
suffering
when
even
the
proudest
*NL*
heart
painfully
crushes
its
pride
and
falls
vanquished
by
grief
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Alyosha
knew
another
terrible
reason
of
her
present
misery
,
though
she
had
*NL*
carefully
concealed
it
from
him
during
those
days
since
the
trial
;
but
it
*NL*
would
have
been
for
some
reason
too
painful
to
him
if
she
had
been
brought
*NL*
so
low
as
to
speak
to
him
now
about
that
.
She
was
suffering
for
her
*NL*
``
treachery
''
at
the
trial
,
and
Alyosha
felt
that
her
conscience
was
*NL*
impelling
her
to
confess
it
to
him
,
to
him
,
Alyosha
,
with
tears
and
cries
*NL*
and
hysterical
writhings
on
the
floor
.
But
he
dreaded
that
moment
and
*NL*
longed
to
spare
her
.
It
made
the
commission
on
which
he
had
come
even
more
*NL*
difficult
.
He
spoke
of
Mitya
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
it
's
all
right
,
do
n't
be
anxious
about
him
!
''
she
began
*NL*
again
,
sharply
and
stubbornly
.
``
All
that
is
only
momentary
,
I
know
him
,
I
*NL*
know
his
heart
only
too
well
.
You
may
be
sure
he
will
consent
to
escape
.
*NL*
It
's
not
as
though
it
would
be
immediately
;
he
will
have
time
to
make
up
*NL*
his
mind
to
it
.
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
will
be
well
by
that
time
and
will
*NL*
manage
it
all
himself
,
so
that
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
Do
n't
*NL*
be
anxious
;
he
will
consent
to
run
away
.
He
has
agreed
already
:
do
you
*NL*
suppose
he
would
give
up
that
creature
?
And
they
wo
n't
let
her
go
to
him
,
*NL*
so
he
is
bound
to
escape
.
It
's
you
he
's
most
afraid
of
,
he
is
afraid
you
*NL*
wo
n't
approve
of
his
escape
on
moral
grounds
.
But
you
must
generously
*NL*
_
allow
_
it
,
if
your
sanction
is
so
necessary
,
''
Katya
added
viciously
.
She
*NL*
paused
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talks
about
some
hymn
,
''
she
went
on
again
,
``
some
cross
he
has
to
bear
,
*NL*
some
duty
;
I
remember
Ivan
Fyodorovitch
told
me
a
great
deal
about
it
,
and
*NL*
if
you
knew
how
he
talked
!
''
Katya
cried
suddenly
,
with
feeling
she
could
*NL*
not
repress
,
``
if
you
knew
how
he
loved
that
wretched
man
at
the
moment
he
*NL*
told
me
,
and
how
he
hated
him
,
perhaps
,
at
the
same
moment
.
And
I
heard
*NL*
his
story
and
his
tears
with
sneering
disdain
.
Brute
!
Yes
,
I
am
a
brute
.
I
*NL*
am
responsible
for
his
fever
.
But
that
man
in
prison
is
incapable
of
*NL*
suffering
,
''
Katya
concluded
irritably
.
``
Can
such
a
man
suffer
?
Men
like
*NL*
him
never
suffer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
note
of
hatred
and
contemptuous
repulsion
in
her
words
.
And
*NL*
yet
it
was
she
who
had
betrayed
him
.
``
Perhaps
because
she
feels
how
she
's
*NL*
wronged
him
she
hates
him
at
moments
,
''
Alyosha
thought
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
hoped
that
it
was
only
``
at
moments
.
''
In
Katya
's
last
words
he
detected
a
*NL*
challenging
note
,
but
he
did
not
take
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sent
for
you
this
morning
to
make
you
promise
to
persuade
him
yourself
.
*NL*
Or
do
you
,
too
,
consider
that
to
escape
would
be
dishonorable
,
cowardly
,
*NL*
or
something
...
unchristian
,
perhaps
?
''
Katya
added
,
even
more
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
I
'll
tell
him
everything
,
''
muttered
Alyosha
.
``
He
asks
you
to
come
*NL*
and
see
him
to-day
,
''
he
blurted
out
suddenly
,
looking
her
steadily
in
the
*NL*
face
.
She
started
,
and
drew
back
a
little
from
him
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
Can
that
be
?
''
she
faltered
,
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
and
ought
to
be
!
''
Alyosha
began
emphatically
,
growing
more
*NL*
animated
.
``
He
needs
you
particularly
just
now
.
I
would
not
have
opened
the
*NL*
subject
and
worried
you
,
if
it
were
not
necessary
.
He
is
ill
,
he
is
beside
*NL*
himself
,
he
keeps
asking
for
you
.
It
is
not
to
be
reconciled
with
you
that
*NL*
he
wants
you
,
but
only
that
you
would
go
and
show
yourself
at
his
door
.
So
*NL*
much
has
happened
to
him
since
that
day
.
He
realizes
that
he
has
injured
*NL*
you
beyond
all
reckoning
.
He
does
not
ask
your
forgiveness
--
`
It
's
*NL*
impossible
to
forgive
me
,

he
says
himself
--
but
only
that
you
would
show
*NL*
yourself
in
his
doorway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
sudden

''
faltered
Katya
.
``
I
've
had
a
presentiment
all

days

ask

impossible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
impossible

Only

he
realizes
for
the
first

time
how
he
has
wounded
you
,
the
first
time
in
his
life
;
he
had
never

grasped
it
before
so
fully

He
said
,
`
If

come
I
shall
be
*NL*
unhappy
all
my
life

Do
you
hear
?
though
he
is
condemned
to
penal
*NL*
servitude
for
twenty
years
,
he
is
still
planning
to
be
happy
--
is
not
that
*NL*
piteous
?
Think
--
you
must
visit
him
;
though
he
is
ruined
,
he
is
innocent

*NL*
broke
like
a
challenge
from
Alyosha
.
``
His
hands
are
clean

there
is
no

him
now

Alyosha
concluded
,
*NL*
laying
immense
stress
on
the
word
``
ought

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought

moaned

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
pity
on

me

''
Katya
said
,
with
bitter
reproach
,
and
she
burst
into
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
come
,
''
said
Alyosha
firmly
,
seeing
her
tears
.
``
I
'll
go
and
*NL*
tell
him
you
will
come
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
tell
him
so
on
any
account
,
''
cried
Katya
in
alarm
.
``
I
will
*NL*
come
,
but
do
n't
tell
him
beforehand
,
for
perhaps
I
may
go
,
but
not
go
*NL*
in
...
I
do
n't
know
yet

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
failed
her
.
She
gasped
for
breath
.
Alyosha
got
up
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
I
meet
any
one
?
''
she
said
suddenly
,
in
a
low
voice
,
turning
*NL*
white
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
why
you
must
go
now
,
to
avoid
meeting
any
one
.
There
will
be
*NL*
no
one
there
,
I
can
tell
you
that
for
certain
.
We
will
expect
you

he
*NL*
concluded
emphatically
,
and
went
out
of

For
A
Moment
The
Lie
Becomes
Truth
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
to
the
hospital
where
Mitya
was
lying
now
.
The
day
after
his
*NL*
fate
was
determined
,
Mitya
had
fallen
ill
with
nervous
fever
,
and
was
sent
*NL*
to
the
prison
division
of
the
town
hospital
.
But
at
the
request
of
several
*NL*
persons
-LRB-
Alyosha
,
Madame
Hohlakov
,
Lise
,
etc.
-RRB-
,
Doctor
Varvinsky
had
put
*NL*
Mitya
not
with
other
prisoners
,
but
in
a
separate
little
room
,
the
one
*NL*
where
Smerdyakov
had
been
.
It
is
true
that
there
was
a
sentinel
at
the
*NL*
other
end
of
the
corridor
,
and
there
was
a
grating
over
the
window
,
so
*NL*
that
Varvinsky
could
be
at
ease
about
the
indulgence
he
had
shown
,
which
*NL*
was
not
quite
legal
,
indeed
;
but
he
was
a
kind-hearted
and
compassionate
*NL*
young
man
.
He
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
for
a
man
like
Mitya
to
pass
at
*NL*
once
so
suddenly
into
the
society
of
robbers
and
murderers
,
and
that
he
*NL*
must
get
used
to
it
by
degrees
.
The
visits
of
relations
and
friends
were
*NL*
informally
sanctioned
by
the
doctor
and
overseer
,
and
even
by
the
police
*NL*
captain
.
But
only
Alyosha
and
Grushenka
had
visited
Mitya
.
Rakitin
had
*NL*
tried
to
force
his
way
in
twice
,
but
Mitya
persistently
begged
Varvinsky
*NL*
not
to
admit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
found
him
sitting
on
his
bed
in
a
hospital
dressing-gown
,
rather
*NL*
feverish
,
with
a
towel
,
soaked
in
vinegar
and
water
,
on
his
head
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
Alyosha
as
he
came
in
with
an
undefined
expression
,
but
there
*NL*
was
a
shade
of
something
like
dread
discernible
in
it
.
He
had
become
*NL*
terribly
preoccupied
since
the
trial
;
sometimes
he
would
be
silent
for
*NL*
half
an
hour
together
,
and
seemed
to
be
pondering
something
heavily
and
*NL*
painfully
,
oblivious
of
everything
about
him
.
If
he
roused
himself
from
*NL*
his
brooding
and
began
to
talk
,
he
always
spoke
with
a
kind
of
abruptness
*NL*
and
never
of
what
he
really
wanted
to
say
.
He
looked
sometimes
with
a
face
*NL*
of
suffering
at
his
brother
.
He
seemed
to
be
more
at
ease
with
Grushenka
*NL*
than
with
Alyosha
.
It
is
true
,
he
scarcely
spoke
to
her
at
all
,
but
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
came
in
,
his
whole
face
lighted
up
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
bed
in
silence
.
This
time
Mitya
was
*NL*
waiting
for
Alyosha
in
suspense
,
but
he
did
not
dare
ask
him
a
question
.
*NL*
He
felt
it
almost
unthinkable
that
Katya
would
consent
to
come
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
he
felt
that
if
she
did
not
come
,
something
inconceivable
would
*NL*
happen
.
Alyosha
understood
his
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trifon
Borissovitch
,
''
Mitya
began
nervously
,
``
has
pulled
his
whole
inn
to
*NL*
pieces
,
I
am
told
.
He
's
taken
up
the
flooring
,
pulled
apart
the
planks
,
*NL*
split
up
all
the
gallery
,
I
am
told
.
He
is
seeking
treasure
all
the
*NL*
time
--
the
fifteen
hundred
roubles
which
the
prosecutor
said
I
'd
hidden
*NL*
there
.
He
began
playing
these
tricks
,
they
say
,
as
soon
as
he
got
home
.
*NL*
Serve
him
right
,
the
swindler
!
The
guard
here
told
me
yesterday
;
he
comes
*NL*
from
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
began
Alyosha
.
``
She
will
come
,
but
I
do
n't
know
when
.
Perhaps
*NL*
to-day
,
perhaps
in
a
few
days
,
that
I
ca
n't
tell
.
But
she
will
come
,
she
*NL*
will
,
that
's
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
started
,
would
have
said
something
,
but
was
silent
.
The
news
had
a
*NL*
tremendous
effect
on
him
.
It
was
evident
that
he
would
have
liked
terribly
*NL*
to
know
what
had
been
said
,
but
he
was
again
afraid
to
ask
.
Something
*NL*
cruel
and
contemptuous
from
Katya
would
have
cut
him
like
a
knife
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
what
she
said
among
other
things
;
that
I
must
be
sure
to
set
*NL*
your
conscience
at
rest
about
escaping
.
If
Ivan
is
not
well
by
then
she
*NL*
will
see
to
it
all
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
spoken
of
that
already
,
''
Mitya
observed
musingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
repeated
it
to
Grusha
,
''
observed
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Mitya
admitted
.
``
She
wo
n't
come
this
morning
.
''
He
looked
timidly
at
*NL*
his
brother
.
``
She
wo
n't
come
till
the
evening
.
When
I
told
her
yesterday
*NL*
that
Katya
was
taking
measures
,
she
was
silent
,
but
she
set
her
mouth
.
She
*NL*
only
whispered
,
`
Let
her
!
'
She
understood
that
it
was
important
.
I
did
not
*NL*
dare
to
try
her
further
.
She
understands
now
,
I
think
,
that
Katya
no
*NL*
longer
cares
for
me
,
but
loves
Ivan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
?
''
broke
from
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
does
not
.
Only
she
is
not
coming
this
morning
,
''
Mitya
*NL*
hastened
to
explain
again
;
``
I
asked
her
to
do
something
for
me
.
You
know
,
*NL*
Ivan
is
superior
to
all
of
us
.
He
ought
to
live
,
not
us
.
He
will
recover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
,
though
Katya
is
alarmed
about
him
,
she
scarcely
*NL*
doubts
of
his
recovery
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
that
she
is
convinced
he
will
die
.
It
's
because
she
is
*NL*
frightened
she
's
so
sure
he
will
get
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
has
a
strong
constitution
,
and
I
,
too
,
believe
there
's
every
hope
*NL*
that
he
will
get
well
,
''
Alyosha
observed
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
will
get
well
.
But
she
is
convinced
that
he
will
die
.
She
has
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
sorrow
to
bear
...
''
A
silence
followed
.
A
grave
anxiety
was
*NL*
fretting
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
I
love
Grusha
terribly
,
''
he
said
suddenly
in
a
shaking
voice
,
*NL*
full
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
let
her
go
out
there
to
you
,
''
Alyosha
put
in
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
something
else
I
wanted
to
tell
you
,
''
Mitya
went
on
,
with
a
*NL*
sudden
ring
in
his
voice
.
``
If
they
beat
me
on
the
way
or
out
there
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
submit
to
it
.
I
shall
kill
some
one
,
and
shall
be
shot
for
it
.
And
*NL*
this
will
be
going
on
for
twenty
years
!
They
speak
to
me
rudely
as
it
is
.
*NL*
I
've
been
lying
here
all
night
,
passing
judgment
on
myself
.
I
am
not
*NL*
ready
!
I
am
not
able
to
resign
myself
.
I
wanted
to
sing
a
`
hymn
'
;
but
if
a
*NL*
guard
speaks
rudely
to
me
,
I
have
not
the
strength
to
bear
it
.
For
Grusha
*NL*
I
would
bear
anything
...
anything
except
blows
...
But
she
wo
n't
be
*NL*
allowed
to
come
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
smiled
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
brother
,
once
for
all
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
is
what
I
think
about
it
.
*NL*
And
you
know
that
I
would
not
tell
you
a
lie
.
Listen
:
you
are
not
ready
,
*NL*
and
such
a
cross
is
not
for
you
.
What
's
more
,
you
do
n't
need
such
a
*NL*
martyr
's
cross
when
you
are
not
ready
for
it
.
If
you
had
murdered
our
*NL*
father
,
it
would
grieve
me
that
you
should
reject
your
punishment
.
But
you
*NL*
are
innocent
,
and
such
a
cross
is
too
much
for
you
.
You
wanted
to
make
*NL*
yourself
another
man
by
suffering
.
I
say
,
only
remember
that
other
man
*NL*
always
,
all
your
life
and
wherever
you
go
;
and
that
will
be
enough
for
*NL*
you
.
Your
refusal
of
that
great
cross
will
only
serve
to
make
you
feel
all
*NL*
your
life
an
even
greater
duty
,
and
that
constant
feeling
will
do
more
to
*NL*
make
you
a
new
man
,
perhaps
,
than
if
you
went
there
.
For
there
you
would
*NL*
not
endure
it
and
would
repine
,
and
perhaps
at
last
would
say
:
'
I
am
*NL*
quits
.
'
The
lawyer
was
right
about
that
.
Such
heavy
burdens
are
not
for
*NL*
all
men
.
For
some
they
are
impossible
.
These
are
my
thoughts
about
it
,
if
*NL*
you
want
them
so
much
.
If
other
men
would
have
to
answer
for
your
escape
,
*NL*
officers
or
soldiers
,
then
I
would
not
have
`
allowed
'
you
,
''
smiled
*NL*
Alyosha
.
``
But
they
declare
--
the
superintendent
of
that
_
etape
_
told
Ivan
*NL*
himself
--
that
if
it
's
well
managed
there
will
be
no
great
inquiry
,
and
that
*NL*
they
can
get
off
easily
.
Of
course
,
bribing
is
dishonest
even
in
such
a
*NL*
case
,
but
I
ca
n't
undertake
to
judge
about
it
,
because
if
Ivan
and
Katya
*NL*
commissioned
me
to
act
for
you
,
I
know
I
should
go
and
give
bribes
.
I
must
*NL*
tell
you
the
truth
.
And
so
I
ca
n't
judge
of
your
own
action
.
But
let
me
*NL*
assure
you
that
I
shall
never
condemn
you
.
And
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
*NL*
if
I
could
judge
you
in
this
.
Now
I
think
I
've
gone
into
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
condemn
myself
!
''
cried
Mitya
.
``
I
shall
escape
,
that
was
settled
*NL*
apart
from
you
;
could
Mitya
Karamazov
do
anything
but
run
away
?
But
I
*NL*
shall
condemn
myself
,
and
I
will
pray
for
my
sin
for
ever
.
That
's
how
the
*NL*
Jesuits
talk
,
is
n't
it
?
Just
as
we
are
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Alyosha
smiled
gently

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
for
always
telling
the
whole
truth

never
hiding
anything

*NL*
cried
Mitya
,
with
a
joyful
laugh
.
``
So
I
've
caught
my
Alyosha
being
*NL*
Jesuitical

I
must
kiss
you
for
that
.
Now
listen
to
the
rest
;
I
'll
open
*NL*
the
other
side
of
my
heart
to
you

This
is
what
I
planned
and
decided
.
If
*NL*
I
run
away
,
even
with
money
and
a
passport
,
and
even
to
America
,
I
should
*NL*
be
cheered
up
by
the
thought
that
I
am
not
running
away
for
pleasure
,
not
*NL*
for
happiness
,
but
to
another
exile
as
bad
,
perhaps
,
as
Siberia
.
It
is
as
*NL*
bad
,
Alyosha
,
it
is
!
I
hate
that
America
,
damn
it
,
already
.
Even
though
*NL*
Grusha
will
be
with
me
.
Just
look
at
her
;
is
she
an
American
?
She
is
*NL*
Russian
,
Russian
to
the
marrow
of
her
bones
;
she
will
be
homesick
for
the
*NL*
mother
country
,
and
I
shall
see
every
hour
that
she
is
suffering
for
my
*NL*
sake
,
that
she
has
taken
up
that
cross
for
me
.
And
what
harm
has
she
done
?
*NL*
And
how
shall
I
,
too
,
put
up
with
the
rabble
out
there
,
though
they
may
be
*NL*
better
than
I
,
every
one
of
them
?
I
hate
that
America
already
!
And
though
*NL*
they
may
be
wonderful
at
machinery
,
every
one
of
them
,
damn
them
,
they
are
*NL*
not
of
my
soul
.
I
love
Russia
,
Alyosha
,
I
love
the
Russian
God
,
though
I
*NL*
am
a
scoundrel
myself
.
I
shall
choke
there
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
his
eyes
*NL*
suddenly
flashing
.
His
voice
was
trembling
with
tears
.
``
So
this
is
what
*NL*
I
've
decided
,
Alyosha
,
listen

''
he
began
again
,
mastering
his
emotion
.
``
As
*NL*
soon
as
I
arrive
there
with
Grusha
,
we
will
set
to
work
at
once
on
the

land
,
in
solitude
,
somewhere
very
remote

with
wild
bears

There
must
be

some
remote

there

I
am
told
there
are
still
Redskins
there

*NL*
somewhere

on
the
edge
of

So
to
the
country
of
the
_
Last
of

the
Mohicans

there
we
'll
tackle
the
grammar
at

Grusha

I.
*NL*
Work
and
grammar

that
's
how
we
'll
spend
three
years

And
by
that
time
we

shall
speak
English

We
'll
run
here
to
Russia
as
American
citizens
.
*NL*
Do
n't
be
uneasy
--
we
would
not
come
to
this
little
town
.
We
'd
hide
*NL*
somewhere
,
a
long
way
off
,
in
the
north
or
in
the
south
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
changed
by
that
time
,
and
she
will
,
too
,
in
America
.
The
doctors
shall
*NL*
make
me
some
sort
of
wart
on
my
face
--
what
's
the
use
of
their
being
so
*NL*
mechanical
!
--
or
else
I
'll
put
out
one
eye
,
let
my
beard
grow
a
yard
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
turn
gray
,
fretting
for
Russia
.
I
dare
say
they
wo
n't
recognize
us
.
*NL*
And
if
they
do
,
let
them
send
us
to
Siberia
.
I
do
n't
care
.
It
will
show
*NL*
it
's
our
fate
.
We
'll
work
on
the
land
here
,
too
,
somewhere
in
the
wilds
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
make
up
as
an
American
all
my
life
.
But
we
shall
die
on
our
own
*NL*
soil
.
That
's
my
plan
,
and
it
sha
n't
be
altered
.
Do
you
approve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
not
wanting
to
contradict
him
.
Mitya
paused
for
a
*NL*
minute
and
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
they
worked
it
up
at
the
trial
!
Did
n't
they
work
it
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
had
not
,
you
would
have
been
convicted
just
the
same
,
''
said
*NL*
Alyosha
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
people
are
sick
of
me
here
!
God
bless
them
,
but
it
's
hard
,
''
Mitya
*NL*
moaned
miserably
.
Again
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
put
me
out
of
my
misery
at
once
!
''
he
exclaimed
suddenly
.
``
Tell
*NL*
me
,
is
she
coming
now
,
or
not
?
Tell
me
?
What
did
she
say
?
How
did
she
say
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
would
come
,
but
I
do
n't
know
whether
she
will
come
to-day
.
*NL*
It
's
hard
for
her
,
you
know
,
''
Alyosha
looked
timidly
at
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
is
hard
for
her
!
Alyosha
,
it
will
drive
me
out
of
my
*NL*
mind
.
Grusha
keeps
looking
at
me
.
She
understands
.
My
God
,
calm
my
heart
:
*NL*
what
is
it
I
want
?
I
want
Katya
!
Do
I
understand
what
I
want
?
It
's
the
*NL*
headstrong
,
evil
Karamazov
spirit
!
No
,
I
am
not
fit
for
suffering
.
I
am
a
*NL*
scoundrel
,
that
's
all
one
can
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
she
is
!
''
cried
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Katya
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
For
a
moment
she
stood
*NL*
still
,
gazing
at
Mitya
with
a
dazed
expression
.
He
leapt
impulsively
to
*NL*
his
feet
,
and
a
scared
look
came
into
his
face
.
He
turned
pale
,
but
a
*NL*
timid
,
pleading
smile
appeared
on
his
lips
at
once
,
and
with
an
*NL*
irresistible
impulse
he
held
out
both
hands
to
Katya
.
Seeing
it
,
she
flew
*NL*
impetuously
to
him
.
She
seized
him
by
the
hands
,
and
almost
by
force
made
*NL*
him
sit
down
on
the
bed
.
She
sat
down
beside
him
,
and
still
keeping
his
*NL*
hands
pressed
them
violently
.
Several
times
they
both
strove
to
speak
,
but
*NL*
stopped
short
and
again
gazed
speechless
with
a
strange
smile
,
their
eyes
*NL*
fastened
on
one
another
.
So
passed
two
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
forgiven
me
?
''
Mitya
faltered
at
last
,
and
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
turning
to
Alyosha
,
his
face
working
with
joy
,
he
cried
,
``
Do
you
hear
what
*NL*
I
am
asking
,
do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
loved
you
for
,
that
you
are
generous
at
heart
!
''
broke
from
*NL*
Katya
.
``
My
forgiveness
is
no
good
to
you
,
nor
yours
to
me
;
whether
you
*NL*
forgive
me
or
not
,
you
will
always
be
a
sore
place
in
my
heart
,
and
I
in
*NL*
yours
--
so
it
must
be
...
''
She
stopped
to
take
breath
.
``
What
have
I
come
*NL*
for
?
''
she
began
again
with
nervous
haste
:
``
to
embrace
your
feet
,
to
press
*NL*
your
hands
like
this
,
till
it
hurts
--
you
remember
how
in
Moscow
I
used
to
*NL*
squeeze
them
--
to
tell
you
again
that
you
are
my
god
,
my
joy
,
to
tell
you
*NL*
that
I
love
you
madly
,
''
she
moaned
in
anguish
,
and
suddenly
pressed
his
*NL*
hand
greedily
to
her
lips
.
Tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
.
Alyosha
stood
*NL*
speechless
and
confounded
;
he
had
never
expected
what
he
was
seeing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
is
over
,
Mitya
!
''
Katya
began
again
,
``
but
the
past
is
painfully
dear
*NL*
to
me
.
Know
that
you
will
always
be
so
.
But
now
let
what
might
have
been
*NL*
come
true
for
one
minute
,
''
she
faltered
,
with
a
drawn
smile
,
looking
into
*NL*
his
face
joyfully
again
.
``
You
love
another
woman
,
and
I
love
another
man
,
*NL*
and
yet
I
shall
love
you
for
ever
,
and
you
will
love
me
;
do
you
know
that
?
*NL*
Do
you
hear
?
Love
me
,
love
me
all
your
life
!
''
she
cried
,
with
a
quiver
*NL*
almost
of
menace
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
love
you
,
and
...
do
you
know
,
Katya
,
''
Mitya
began
,
drawing
a
*NL*
deep
breath
at
each
word
,
``
do
you
know
,
five
days
ago
,
that
same
evening
,
*NL*
I
loved
you
...
When
you
fell
down
and
were
carried
out
...
All
my
life
!
*NL*
So
it
will
be
,
so
it
will
always
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
murmured
to
one
another
frantic
words
,
almost
meaningless
,
perhaps
*NL*
not
even
true
,
but
at
that
moment
it
was
all
true
,
and
they
both
believed
*NL*
what
they
said
implicitly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katya
,
''
cried
Mitya
suddenly
,
``
do
you
believe
I
murdered
him
?
I
know
you
*NL*
do
n't
believe
it
now
,
but
then
...
when
you
gave
evidence
...
Surely
,
*NL*
surely
you
did
not
believe
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
believe
it
even
then
.
I
've
never
believed
it
.
I
hated
you
,
and
*NL*
for
a
moment
I
persuaded
myself
.
While
I
was
giving
evidence
I
persuaded
*NL*
myself
and
believed
it
,
but
when
I
'd
finished
speaking
I
left
off
*NL*
believing
it
at
once
.
Do
n't
doubt
that
!
I
have
forgotten
that
I
came
here
*NL*
to
punish
myself
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
new
expression
in
her
voice
,
quite
*NL*
unlike
the
loving
tones
of
a
moment
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
yours
is
a
heavy
burden
,
''
broke
,
as
it
were
,
involuntarily
from
*NL*
Mitya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
I
'll
come
again
.
It
's
more
than
I
can
bear
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
getting
up
from
her
place
,
but
suddenly
uttered
a
loud
scream
and
*NL*
staggered
back
.
Grushenka
walked
suddenly
and
noiselessly
into
the
room
.
*NL*
No
one
had
expected
her
.
Katya
moved
swiftly
to
the
door
,
but
when
she
*NL*
reached
Grushenka
,
she
stopped
suddenly
,
turned
as
white
as
chalk
and
*NL*
moaned
softly
,
almost
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grushenka
stared
at
her
and
,
pausing
for
an
instant
,
in
a
vindictive
,
*NL*
venomous
voice
,
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
full
of
hatred
,
my
girl
,
you
and
I
!
We
are
both
full
of
hatred
!
As
*NL*
though
we
could
forgive
one
another
!
Save
him
,
and
I
'll
worship
you
all
my
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
forgive
her
!
''
cried
Mitya
,
with
frantic
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
anxious
,
I
'll
save
him
for
you
!
''
Katya
whispered
rapidly
,
and
*NL*
she
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
could
refuse
to
forgive
her
when
she
begged
your
forgiveness
*NL*
herself
?
''
Mitya
exclaimed
bitterly
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitya
,
do
n't
dare
to
blame
her
;
you
have
no
right
to
!
''
Alyosha
cried
*NL*
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
proud
lips
spoke
,
not
her
heart
,
''
Grushenka
brought
out
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
disgust
.
``
If
she
saves
you
I
'll
forgive
her
everything
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
speaking
,
as
though
suppressing
something
.
She
could
not
yet
*NL*
recover
herself
.
She
had
come
in
,
as
appeared
afterwards
,
accidentally
,
*NL*
with
no
suspicion
of
what
she
would
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyosha
,
run
after
her
!
''
Mitya
cried
to
his
brother
;
``
tell
her
...
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
...
do
n't
let
her
go
away
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
to
you
again
at
nightfall
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
and
he
ran
after
*NL*
Katya
.
He
overtook
her
outside
the
hospital
grounds
.
She
was
walking
fast
,
*NL*
but
as
soon
as
Alyosha
caught
her
up
she
said
quickly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
before
that
woman
I
ca
n't
punish
myself
!
I
asked
her
forgiveness
*NL*
because
I
wanted
to
punish
myself
to
the
bitter
end
.
She
would
not
forgive
*NL*
me
...
I
like
her
for
that
!
''
she
added
,
in
an
unnatural
voice
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
flashed
with
fierce
resentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
did
not
expect
this
in
the
least
,
''
muttered
Alyosha
.
``
He
was
*NL*
sure
she
would
not
come
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
.
Let
us
leave
that
,
''
she
snapped
.
``
Listen
:
I
ca
n't
go
with
you
*NL*
to
the
funeral
now

I
've
sent
them
flowers

I
think
they
still
have
money

*NL*
If
necessary

tell
them
I
'll
never
abandon
them

Now
leave
me

leave
*NL*
me

You
are
late

Chapter
III
.
Ilusha
's
Funeral
.
The
Speech
At
The
Stone
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
was
late
.
They
had
waited
for
him
and
had
already
decided
to
*NL*
bear
the
pretty
flower-decked
little
coffin
to
the
church
without
him
.
It
*NL*
was
the
coffin
of
poor
little
Ilusha
.
He
had
died
two
days
after
Mitya
was
*NL*
sentenced
.
At
the
gate
of
the
house
Alyosha
was
met
by
the
shouts
of
the
*NL*
boys
,
Ilusha
's
schoolfellows
.
They
had
all
been
impatiently
expecting
him
*NL*
and
were
glad
that
he
had
come
at
last
.
There
were
about
twelve
of
them
,
*NL*
they
all
had
their
school-bags
or
satchels
on
their
shoulders
.
``
Father
*NL*
will
cry
,
be
with
father
,
''
Ilusha
had
told
them
as
he
lay
dying
,
and
the
*NL*
boys
remembered
it
.
Kolya
Krassotkin
was
the
foremost
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
you
've
come
,
Karamazov
!
''
he
cried
,
holding
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
Alyosha
.
``
It
's
awful
here
.
It
's
really
horrible
to
see
it
.
Snegiryov
is
*NL*
not
drunk
,
we
know
for
a
fact
he
's
had
nothing
to
drink
to-day
,
but
he
*NL*
seems
as
if
he
were
drunk
...
I
am
always
manly
,
but
this
is
awful
.
*NL*
Karamazov
,
if
I
am
not
keeping
you
,
one
question
before
you
go
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Kolya
?
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
brother
innocent
or
guilty
?
Was
it
he
killed
your
father
or
was
*NL*
it
the
valet
?
As
you
say
,
so
it
will
be
.
I
have
n't
slept
for
the
last
four
*NL*
nights
for
thinking
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
valet
killed
him
,
my
brother
is
innocent
,
''
answered
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
said
,
''
cried
Smurov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
will
perish
an
innocent
victim
!
''
exclaimed
Kolya
;
``
though
he
is
*NL*
ruined
he
is
happy
!
I
could
envy
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
How
can
you
?
Why
?
''
cried
Alyosha
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
,
too
,
could
sacrifice
myself
some
day
for
truth
!
''
said
Kolya
*NL*
with
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
in
such
a
cause
,
not
with
such
disgrace
and
such
horror
!
''
said
*NL*
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
...
I
should
like
to
die
for
all
humanity
,
and
as
for
disgrace
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
care
about
that
--
our
names
may
perish
.
I
respect
your
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
do
I
!
''
the
boy
,
who
had
once
declared
that
he
knew
who
had
founded
*NL*
Troy
,
cried
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
,
and
he
blushed
up
to
his
ears
like
*NL*
a
peony
as
he
had
done
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alyosha
went
into
the
room
.
Ilusha
lay
with
his
hands
folded
and
his
eyes
*NL*
closed
in
a
blue
coffin
with
a
white
frill
round
it
.
His
thin
face
was
*NL*
hardly
changed
at
all
,
and
strange
to
say
there
was
no
smell
of
decay
from
*NL*
the
corpse
.
The
expression
of
his
face
was
serious
and
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
thoughtful
.
His
hands
,
crossed
over
his
breast
,
looked
particularly
*NL*
beautiful
,
as
though
chiseled
in
marble
.
There
were
flowers
in
his
hands
*NL*
and
the
coffin
,
inside
and
out
,
was
decked
with
flowers
,
which
had
been
*NL*
sent
early
in
the
morning
by
Lise
Hohlakov
.
But
there
were
flowers
too
*NL*
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
when
Alyosha
opened
the
door
,
the
captain
had
*NL*
a
bunch
in
his
trembling
hands
and
was
strewing
them
again
over
his
dear
*NL*
boy
.
He
scarcely
glanced
at
Alyosha
when
he
came
in
,
and
he
would
not
look
*NL*
at
any
one
,
even
at
his
crazy
weeping
wife
,
``
mamma
,
''
who
kept
trying
to
*NL*
stand
on
her
crippled
legs
to
get
a
nearer
look
at
her
dead
boy
.
Nina
had
*NL*
been
pushed
in
her
chair
by
the
boys
close
up
to
the
coffin
.
She
sat
with
*NL*
her
head
pressed
to
it
and
she
too
was
no
doubt
quietly
weeping
.
*NL*
Snegiryov
's
face
looked
eager
,
yet
bewildered
and
exasperated
.
There
was
*NL*
something
crazy
about
his
gestures
and
the
words
that
broke
from
him
.
``
Old
*NL*
man
,
dear
old
man
!
''
he
exclaimed
every
minute
,
gazing
at
Ilusha
.
It
was
*NL*
his
habit
to
call
Ilusha
``
old
man
,
''
as
a
term
of
affection
when
he
was
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
give
me
a
flower
,
too
;
take
that
white
one
out
of
his
hand
and
*NL*
give
it
me
,
''
the
crazy
mother
begged
,
whimpering
.
Either
because
the
*NL*
little
white
rose
in
Ilusha
's
hand
had
caught
her
fancy
or
that
she
wanted
*NL*
one
from
his
hand
to
keep
in
memory
of
him
,
she
moved
restlessly
,
*NL*
stretching
out
her
hands
for
the
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
give
it
to
any
one
,
I
wo
n't
give
you
anything
,
''
Snegiryov
cried
*NL*
callously
.
``
They
are
his
flowers
,
not
yours
!
Everything
is
his
,
nothing
is
*NL*
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
give
mother
a
flower
!
''
said
Nina
,
lifting
her
face
wet
with
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
give
away
anything
and
to
her
less
than
any
one
!
She
did
n't
love
*NL*
Ilusha
.
She
took
away
his
little
cannon
and
he
gave
it
to
her
,
''
the
*NL*
captain
broke
into
loud
sobs
at
the
thought
of
how
Ilusha
had
given
up
his
*NL*
cannon
to
his
mother
.
The
poor
,
crazy
creature
was
bathed
in
noiseless
*NL*
tears
,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
,
seeing
that
the
father
would
not
leave
the
coffin
and
that
it
*NL*
was
time
to
carry
it
out
,
stood
round
it
in
a
close
circle
and
began
to
*NL*
lift
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
him
to
be
buried
in
the
churchyard
,
''
Snegiryov
wailed
*NL*
suddenly
;
``
I
'll
bury
him
by
the
stone
,
by
our
stone
!
Ilusha
told
me
to
.
I
*NL*
wo
n't
let
him
be
carried
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
saying
for
the
last
three
days
that
he
would
bury
him
by
the
*NL*
stone
,
but
Alyosha
,
Krassotkin
,
the
landlady
,
her
sister
and
all
the
boys
*NL*
interfered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
idea
,
bury
him
by
an
unholy
stone
,
as
though
he
had
hanged
*NL*
himself
!
''
the
old
landlady
said
sternly
.
``
There
in
the
churchyard
the
*NL*
ground
has
been
crossed
.
He
'll
be
prayed
for
there
.
One
can
hear
the
*NL*
singing
in
church
and
the
deacon
reads
so
plainly
and
verbally
that
it
*NL*
will
reach
him
every
time
just
as
though
it
were
read
over
his
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
captain
made
a
gesture
of
despair
as
though
to
say
,
``
Take
him
*NL*
where
you
will
.
''
The
boys
raised
the
coffin
,
but
as
they
passed
the
*NL*
mother
,
they
stopped
for
a
moment
and
lowered
it
that
she
might
say
good
-
*NL*
by
to
Ilusha
.
But
on
seeing
that
precious
little
face
,
which
for
the
last
*NL*
three
days
she
had
only
looked
at
from
a
distance
,
she
trembled
all
over
*NL*
and
her
gray
head
began
twitching
spasmodically
over
the
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
,
give
him
your
blessing
,
kiss
*NL*
him
,
''
Nina
cried
to
her
.
But
her
head
still
twitched
like
an
automaton
and
*NL*
with
a
face
contorted
with
bitter
grief
she
began
,
without
a
word
,
beating
*NL*
her
breast
with
her
fist
.
They
carried
the
coffin
past
her
.
Nina
pressed
*NL*
her
lips
to
her
brother
's
for
the
last
time
as
they
bore
the
coffin
by
*NL*
her
.
As
Alyosha
went
out
of
the
house
he
begged
the
landlady
to
look
after
*NL*
those
who
were
left
behind
,
but
she
interrupted
him
before
he
had
*NL*
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
I
'll
stay
with
them
,
we
are
Christians
,
too
.
''
The
old
woman
*NL*
wept
as
she
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
far
to
carry
the
coffin
to
the
church
,
not
more
than
three
*NL*
hundred
paces
.
It
was
a
still
,
clear
day
,
with
a
slight
frost
.
The
church
*NL*
bells
were
still
ringing
.
Snegiryov
ran
fussing
and
distracted
after
the
*NL*
coffin
,
in
his
short
old
summer
overcoat
,
with
his
head
bare
and
his
soft
,
*NL*
old
,
wide-brimmed
hat
in
his
hand
.
He
seemed
in
a
state
of
bewildered
*NL*
anxiety
.
At
one
minute
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
support
the
head
of
*NL*
the
coffin
and
only
hindered
the
bearers
,
at
another
he
ran
alongside
and
*NL*
tried
to
find
a
place
for
himself
there
.
A
flower
fell
on
the
snow
and
he
*NL*
rushed
to
pick
it
up
as
though
everything
in
the
world
depended
on
the
*NL*
loss
of
that
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
crust
of
bread
,
we
've
forgotten
the
crust
!
''
he
cried
suddenly
in
*NL*
dismay
.
But
the
boys
reminded
him
at
once
that
he
had
taken
the
crust
of
*NL*
bread
already
and
that
it
was
in
his
pocket
.
He
instantly
pulled
it
out
*NL*
and
was
reassured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilusha
told
me
to
,
Ilusha
,
''
he
explained
at
once
to
Alyosha
.
``
I
was
*NL*
sitting
by
him
one
night
and
he
suddenly
told
me
:
`
Father
,
when
my
grave
*NL*
is
filled
up
crumble
a
piece
of
bread
on
it
so
that
the
sparrows
may
fly
*NL*
down
,
I
shall
hear
and
it
will
cheer
me
up
not
to
be
lying
alone
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
thing
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
``
we
must
often
take
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
day
,
every
day
!
''
said
the
captain
quickly
,
seeming
cheered
at
the
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
church
at
last
and
set
the
coffin
in
the
middle
of
it
.
*NL*
The
boys
surrounded
it
and
remained
reverently
standing
so
,
all
through
*NL*
the
service
.
It
was
an
old
and
rather
poor
church
;
many
of
the
ikons
were
*NL*
without
settings
;
but
such
churches
are
the
best
for
praying
in
.
During
*NL*
the
mass
Snegiryov
became
somewhat
calmer
,
though
at
times
he
had
*NL*
outbursts
of
the
same
unconscious
and
,
as
it
were
,
incoherent
anxiety
.
At
*NL*
one
moment
he
went
up
to
the
coffin
to
set
straight
the
cover
or
the
*NL*
wreath
,
when
a
candle
fell
out
of
the
candlestick
he
rushed
to
replace
it
*NL*
and
was
a
fearful
time
fumbling
over
it
,
then
he
subsided
and
stood
*NL*
quietly
by
the
coffin
with
a
look
of
blank
uneasiness
and
perplexity
.
*NL*
After
the
Epistle
he
suddenly
whispered
to
Alyosha
,
who
was
standing
*NL*
beside
him
,
that
the
Epistle
had
not
been
read
properly
but
did
not
*NL*
explain
what
he
meant
.
During
the
prayer
,
``
Like
the
Cherubim
,
''
he
joined
*NL*
in
the
singing
but
did
not
go
on
to
the
end
.
Falling
on
his
knees
,
he
*NL*
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
stone
floor
and
lay
so
for
a
long
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
came
the
funeral
service
itself
and
candles
were
distributed
.
The
*NL*
distracted
father
began
fussing
about
again
,
but
the
touching
and
*NL*
impressive
funeral
prayers
moved
and
roused
his
soul
.
He
seemed
suddenly
*NL*
to
shrink
together
and
broke
into
rapid
,
short
sobs
,
which
he
tried
at
*NL*
first
to
smother
,
but
at
last
he
sobbed
aloud
.
When
they
began
taking
*NL*
leave
of
the
dead
and
closing
the
coffin
,
he
flung
his
arms
about
,
as
*NL*
though
he
would
not
allow
them
to
cover
Ilusha
,
and
began
greedily
and
*NL*
persistently
kissing
his
dead
boy
on
the
lips
.
At
last
they
succeeded
in
*NL*
persuading
him
to
come
away
from
the
step
,
but
suddenly
he
impulsively
*NL*
stretched
out
his
hand
and
snatched
a
few
flowers
from
the
coffin
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
them
and
a
new
idea
seemed
to
dawn
upon
him
,
so
that
he
*NL*
apparently
forgot
his
grief
for
a
minute
.
Gradually
he
seemed
to
sink
into
*NL*
brooding
and
did
not
resist
when
the
coffin
was
lifted
up
and
carried
to
*NL*
the
grave
.
It
was
an
expensive
one
in
the
churchyard
close
to
the
church
,
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
paid
for
it
.
After
the
customary
rites
the
grave
-
*NL*
diggers
lowered
the
coffin
.
Snegiryov
with
his
flowers
in
his
hands
bent
*NL*
down
so
low
over
the
open
grave
that
the
boys
caught
hold
of
his
coat
in
*NL*
alarm
and
pulled
him
back
.
He
did
not
seem
to
understand
fully
what
was
*NL*
happening
.
When
they
began
filling
up
the
grave
,
he
suddenly
pointed
*NL*
anxiously
at
the
falling
earth
and
began
trying
to
say
something
,
but
no
*NL*
one
could
make
out
what
he
meant
,
and
he
stopped
suddenly
.
Then
he
was
*NL*
reminded
that
he
must
crumble
the
bread
and
he
was
awfully
excited
,
*NL*
snatched
up
the
bread
and
began
pulling
it
to
pieces
and
flinging
the
*NL*
morsels
on
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
fly
down
,
birds
,
fly
down
,
sparrows
!
''
he
muttered
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
boys
observed
that
it
was
awkward
for
him
to
crumble
the
bread
*NL*
with
the
flowers
in
his
hands
and
suggested
he
should
give
them
to
some
*NL*
one
to
hold
for
a
time
.
But
he
would
not
do
this
and
seemed
indeed
*NL*
suddenly
alarmed
for
his
flowers
,
as
though
they
wanted
to
take
them
from
*NL*
him
altogether
.
And
after
looking
at
the
grave
,
and
as
it
were
,
satisfying
*NL*
himself
that
everything
had
been
done
and
the
bread
had
been
crumbled
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
,
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
,
turned
,
quite
composedly
even
,
and
*NL*
made
his
way
homewards
.
But
his
steps
became
more
and
more
hurried
,
he
*NL*
almost
ran
.
The
boys
and
Alyosha
kept
up
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
flowers
are
for
mamma
,
the
flowers
are
for
mamma
!
I
was
unkind
to
*NL*
mamma
,
''
he
began
exclaiming
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
called
to
him
to
put
on
his
hat
as
it
was
cold
.
But
he
flung
the
*NL*
hat
in
the
snow
as
though
he
were
angry
and
kept
repeating
,
``
I
wo
n't
have
*NL*
the
hat
,
I
wo
n't
have
the
hat
.
''
Smurov
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
after
*NL*
him
.
All
the
boys
were
crying
,
and
Kolya
and
the
boy
who
discovered
about
*NL*
Troy
most
of
all
.
Though
Smurov
,
with
the
captain
's
hat
in
his
hand
,
was
*NL*
crying
bitterly
too
,
he
managed
,
as
he
ran
,
to
snatch
up
a
piece
of
red
*NL*
brick
that
lay
on
the
snow
of
the
path
,
to
fling
it
at
the
flock
of
*NL*
sparrows
that
was
flying
by
.
He
missed
them
,
of
course
,
and
went
on
crying
*NL*
as
he
ran
.
Half-way
,
Snegiryov
suddenly
stopped
,
stood
still
for
half
a
*NL*
minute
,
as
though
struck
by
something
,
and
suddenly
turning
back
to
the
*NL*
church
,
ran
towards
the
deserted
grave
.
But
the
boys
instantly
overtook
*NL*
him
and
caught
hold
of
him
on
all
sides
.
Then
he
fell
helpless
on
the
snow
*NL*
as
though
he
had
been
knocked
down
,
and
struggling
,
sobbing
,
and
wailing
,
*NL*
he
began
crying
out
,
``
Ilusha
,
old
man
,
dear
old
man
!
''
Alyosha
and
Kolya
*NL*
tried
to
make
him
get
up
,
soothing
and
persuading
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
give
over
,
a
brave
man
must
show
fortitude
,
''
muttered
Kolya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
spoil
the
flowers
,
''
said
Alyosha
,
``
and
mamma
is
expecting
them
,
*NL*
she
is
sitting
crying
because
you
would
not
give
her
any
before
.
Ilusha
's
*NL*
little
bed
is
still
there
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
mamma
!
''
Snegiryov
suddenly
recollected
,
``
they
'll
take
away
the
*NL*
bed
,
they
'll
take
it
away
,
''
he
added
as
though
alarmed
that
they
really
*NL*
would
.
He
jumped
up
and
ran
homewards
again
.
But
it
was
not
far
off
and
*NL*
they
all
arrived
together
.
Snegiryov
opened
the
door
hurriedly
and
called
*NL*
to
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
so
cruelly
quarreled
just
before
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
poor
crippled
darling
,
Ilusha
has
sent
you
these
flowers
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
holding
out
to
her
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
that
had
been
frozen
*NL*
and
broken
while
he
was
struggling
in
the
snow
.
But
at
that
instant
he
saw
*NL*
in
the
corner
,
by
the
little
bed
,
Ilusha
's
little
boots
,
which
the
*NL*
landlady
had
put
tidily
side
by
side
.
Seeing
the
old
,
patched
,
rusty
-
*NL*
looking
,
stiff
boots
he
flung
up
his
hands
and
rushed
to
them
,
fell
on
his
*NL*
knees
,
snatched
up
one
boot
and
,
pressing
his
lips
to
it
,
began
kissing
it
*NL*
greedily
,
crying
,
``
Ilusha

the

cried
in

voice
.
Nina
,
too
,
broke
into
sobs
.
Kolya
ran
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
the
boys
followed
him
.
At
last
Alyosha
too
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

weep
,
''
he
said
to
Kolya
,
``
it
's
no
use
trying
to
comfort
them

just
now

Let

wait
a

back

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it

no

it
's
awful
,
''
Kolya
assented
.
``
Do
you
know
,
Karamazov
,
''
*NL*
he
dropped
his
voice
so
that
no
one
could
hear
them
,
``
I
feel
dreadfully
*NL*
sad
,
and
if
it
were
only
possible
to
bring
him
back
,
I
'd
give
anything
in
*NL*
the
world
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
would
I
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think

Karamazov

Had
we
better
come
back
here
to-night

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
will
.
Let
us
come
together
,
you
and
I
,
that
will
be
enough
,
to
*NL*
spend
an
hour
with
them
,
with
the
mother
and
Nina
.
If
we
all
come
together
*NL*
we
shall
remind

of
everything
again

Alyosha
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
landlady
is
laying
the
table
for

now

there
'll
be
a
funeral

dinner

is
coming

shall
we
go
back
to
it

*NL*
Karamazov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Alyosha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
so
strange
,
Karamazov
,
such
sorrow
and
then
pancakes
after
it

*NL*
it
all
seems
so
unnatural
in
our
religion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
going
to
have
salmon
,
too
,
''
the
boy
who
had
discovered
about
*NL*
Troy
observed
in
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
most
earnestly
,
Kartashov
,
not
to
interrupt
again
with
your
*NL*
idiotic
remarks
,
especially
when
one
is
not
talking
to
you
and
does
n't
*NL*
care
to
know
whether
you
exist
or
not
!
''
Kolya
snapped
out
irritably
.
The
*NL*
boy
flushed
crimson
but
did
not
dare
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
they
were
strolling
slowly
along
the
path
and
suddenly
Smurov
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Ilusha
's
stone
,
under
which
they
wanted
to
bury
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
stood
still
by
the
big
stone
.
Alyosha
looked
and
the
whole
*NL*
picture
of
what
Snegiryov
had
described
to
him
that
day
,
how
Ilusha
,
*NL*
weeping
and
hugging
his
father
,
had
cried
,
``
Father
,
father
,
how
he
*NL*
insulted
you
,
''
rose
at
once
before
his
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
impulse
seemed
to
come
into
his
soul
.
With
a
serious
and
earnest
*NL*
expression
he
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
bright
,
pleasant
faces
of
*NL*
Ilusha
's
schoolfellows
,
and
suddenly
said
to
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
I
should
like
to
say
one
word
to
you
,
here
at
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
stood
round
him
and
at
once
bent
attentive
and
expectant
eyes
*NL*
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
we
shall
soon
part
.
I
shall
be
for
some
time
with
my
two
brothers
,
*NL*
of
whom
one
is
going
to
Siberia
and
the
other
is
lying
at
death
's
door
.
*NL*
But
soon
I
shall
leave
this
town
,
perhaps
for
a
long
time
,
so
we
shall
*NL*
part
.
Let
us
make
a
compact
here
,
at
Ilusha
's
stone
,
that
we
will
never
*NL*
forget
Ilusha
and
one
another
.
And
whatever
happens
to
us
later
in
life
,
*NL*
if
we
do
n't
meet
for
twenty
years
afterwards
,
let
us
always
remember
how
*NL*
we
buried
the
poor
boy
at
whom
we
once
threw
stones
,
do
you
remember
,
by
*NL*
the
bridge
?
and
afterwards
we
all
grew
so
fond
of
him
.
He
was
a
fine
boy
,
*NL*
a
kind-hearted
,
brave
boy
,
he
felt
for
his
father
's
honor
and
resented
the
*NL*
cruel
insult
to
him
and
stood
up
for
him
.
And
so
in
the
first
place
,
we
*NL*
will
remember
him
,
boys
,
all
our
lives
.
And
even
if
we
are
occupied
with
*NL*
most
important
things
,
if
we
attain
to
honor
or
fall
into
great
*NL*
misfortune
--
still
let
us
remember
how
good
it
was
once
here
,
when
we
were
*NL*
all
together
,
united
by
a
good
and
kind
feeling
which
made
us
,
for
the
*NL*
time
we
were
loving
that
poor
boy
,
better
perhaps
than
we
are
.
My
little
*NL*
doves
--
let
me
call
you
so
,
for
you
are
very
like
them
,
those
pretty
blue
*NL*
birds
,
at
this
minute
as
I
look
at
your
good
dear
faces
.
My
dear
children
,
*NL*
perhaps
you
wo
n't
understand
what
I
am
saying
to
you
,
because
I
often
*NL*
speak
very
unintelligibly
,
but
you
'll
remember
it
all
the
same
and
will
*NL*
agree
with
my
words
some
time
.
You
must
know
that
there
is
nothing
higher
*NL*
and
stronger
and
more
wholesome
and
good
for
life
in
the
future
than
some
*NL*
good
memory
,
especially
a
memory
of
childhood
,
of
home
.
People
talk
to
you
*NL*
a
great
deal
about
your
education
,
but
some
good
,
sacred
memory
,
preserved
*NL*
from
childhood
,
is
perhaps
the
best
education
.
If
a
man
carries
many
such
*NL*
memories
with
him
into
life
,
he
is
safe
to
the
end
of
his
days
,
and
if
one
*NL*
has
only
one
good
memory
left
in
one
's
heart
,
even
that
may
sometime
be
*NL*
the
means
of
saving
us
.
Perhaps
we
may
even
grow
wicked
later
on
,
may
be
*NL*
unable
to
refrain
from
a
bad
action
,
may
laugh
at
men
's
tears
and
at
those
*NL*
people
who
say
as
Kolya
did
just
now
,
'
I
want
to
suffer
for
all
men
,
'
and
*NL*
may
even
jeer
spitefully
at
such
people
.
But
however
bad
we
may
*NL*
become
--
which
God
forbid
--
yet
,
when
we
recall
how
we
buried
Ilusha
,
how
we
*NL*
loved
him
in
his
last
days
,
and
how
we
have
been
talking
like
friends
all
*NL*
together
,
at
this
stone
,
the
cruelest
and
most
mocking
of
us
--
if
we
do
*NL*
become
so
--
will
not
dare
to
laugh
inwardly
at
having
been
kind
and
good
at
*NL*
this
moment
!
What
's
more
,
perhaps
,
that
one
memory
may
keep
him
from
great
*NL*
evil
and
he
will
reflect
and
say
,
`
Yes
,
I
was
good
and
brave
and
honest
*NL*
then
!
'
Let
him
laugh
to
himself
,
that
's
no
matter
,
a
man
often
laughs
at
*NL*
what
's
good
and
kind
.
That
's
only
from
thoughtlessness
.
But
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
boys
,
that
as
he
laughs
he
will
say
at
once
in
his
heart
,
`
No
,
I
do
wrong
*NL*
to
laugh
,
for
that
's
not
a
thing
to
laugh
at
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
so
,
I
understand
you
,
Karamazov
!
''
cried
Kolya
,
with
flashing
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
were
excited
and
they
,
too
,
wanted
to
say
something
,
but
they
*NL*
restrained
themselves
,
looking
with
intentness
and
emotion
at
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
this
in
case
we
become
bad
,
''
Alyosha
went
on
,
``
but
there
's
no
*NL*
reason
why
we
should
become
bad
,
is
there
,
boys
?
Let
us
be
,
first
and
*NL*
above
all
,
kind
,
then
honest
and
then
let
us
never
forget
each
other
!
I
*NL*
say
that
again
.
I
give
you
my
word
for
my
part
that
I
'll
never
forget
one
*NL*
of
you
.
Every
face
looking
at
me
now
I
shall
remember
even
for
thirty
*NL*
years
.
Just
now
Kolya
said
to
Kartashov
that
we
did
not
care
to
know
*NL*
whether
he
exists
or
not
.
But
I
can
not
forget
that
Kartashov
exists
and
*NL*
that
he
is
not
blushing
now
as
he
did
when
he
discovered
the
founders
of
*NL*
Troy
,
but
is
looking
at
me
with
his
jolly
,
kind
,
dear
little
eyes
.
Boys
,
*NL*
my
dear
boys
,
let
us
all
be
generous
and
brave
like
Ilusha
,
clever
,
brave
*NL*
and
generous
like
Kolya
-LRB-
though
he
will
be
ever
so
much
cleverer
when
he
*NL*
is
grown
up
-RRB-
,
and
let
us
all
be
as
modest
,
as
clever
and
sweet
as
*NL*
Kartashov
.
But
why
am
I
talking
about
those
two
?
You
are
all
dear
to
me
,
*NL*
boys
,
from
this
day
forth
,
I
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
you
all
,
and
I
*NL*
beg
you
to
keep
a
place
in
your
hearts
for
me
!
Well

and
who
has
united
us
*NL*
in
this
kind
,
good
feeling
which
we
shall
remember
and
intend
to
remember
*NL*
all
our
lives

Who

Ilusha

the
good

precious
