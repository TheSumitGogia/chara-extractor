''
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
did
not
read
the
newspapers
,
or
he
would
have
known
that
trouble
*NL*
was
brewing
,
not
alone
for
himself
,
but
for
every
tide-water
dog
,
strong
*NL*
of
muscle
and
with
warm
,
long
hair
,
from
Puget
Sound
to
San
Diego
.
*NL*
Because
men
,
groping
in
the
Arctic
darkness
,
had
found
a
yellow
metal
,
*NL*
and
because
steamship
and
transportation
companies
were
booming
the
*NL*
find
,
thousands
of
men
were
rushing
into
the
Northland
.
These
men
wanted
*NL*
dogs
,
and
the
dogs
they
wanted
were
heavy
dogs
,
with
strong
muscles
by
*NL*
which
to
toil
,
and
furry
coats
to
protect
them
from
the
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
lived
at
a
big
house
in
the
sun-kissed
Santa
Clara
Valley
.
Judge
*NL*
Miller
's
place
,
it
was
called
.
It
stood
back
from
the
road
,
half
hidden
*NL*
among
the
trees
,
through
which
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
the
wide
*NL*
cool
veranda
that
ran
around
its
four
sides
.
The
house
was
approached
by
*NL*
gravelled
driveways
which
wound
about
through
wide-spreading
lawns
and
*NL*
under
the
interlacing
boughs
of
tall
poplars
.
At
the
rear
things
were
on
*NL*
even
a
more
spacious
scale
than
at
the
front
.
There
were
great
stables
,
*NL*
where
a
dozen
grooms
and
boys
held
forth
,
rows
of
vine-clad
servants
'
*NL*
cottages
,
an
endless
and
orderly
array
of
outhouses
,
long
grape
arbors
,
*NL*
green
pastures
,
orchards
,
and
berry
patches
.
Then
there
was
the
pumping
*NL*
plant
for
the
artesian
well
,
and
the
big
cement
tank
where
Judge
*NL*
Miller
's
boys
took
their
morning
plunge
and
kept
cool
in
the
hot
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
over
this
great
demesne
Buck
ruled
.
Here
he
was
born
,
and
here
he
*NL*
had
lived
the
four
years
of
his
life
.
It
was
true
,
there
were
other
*NL*
dogs
,
There
could
not
but
be
other
dogs
on
so
vast
a
place
,
but
they
did
*NL*
not
count
.
They
came
and
went
,
resided
in
the
populous
kennels
,
or
lived
*NL*
obscurely
in
the
recesses
of
the
house
after
the
fashion
of
Toots
,
the
*NL*
Japanese
pug
,
or
Ysabel
,
the
Mexican
hairless
,
--
strange
creatures
that
*NL*
rarely
put
nose
out
of
doors
or
set
foot
to
ground
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
there
were
the
fox
terriers
,
a
score
of
them
at
least
,
who
yelped
*NL*
fearful
promises
at
Toots
and
Ysabel
looking
out
of
the
windows
at
them
*NL*
and
protected
by
a
legion
of
housemaids
armed
with
brooms
and
mops
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Buck
was
neither
house-dog
nor
kennel-dog
.
The
whole
realm
was
his
.
*NL*
He
plunged
into
the
swimming
tank
or
went
hunting
with
the
Judge
's
sons
;
*NL*
he
escorted
Mollie
and
Alice
,
the
Judge
's
daughters
,
on
long
twilight
*NL*
or
early
morning
rambles
;
on
wintry
nights
he
lay
at
the
Judge
's
feet
*NL*
before
the
roaring
library
fire
;
he
carried
the
Judge
's
grandsons
on
his
*NL*
back
,
or
rolled
them
in
the
grass
,
and
guarded
their
footsteps
through
*NL*
wild
adventures
down
to
the
fountain
in
the
stable
yard
,
and
even
*NL*
beyond
,
where
the
paddocks
were
,
and
the
berry
patches
.
Among
the
*NL*
terriers
he
stalked
imperiously
,
and
Toots
and
Ysabel
he
utterly
*NL*
ignored
,
for
he
was
king
,
--
king
over
all
creeping
,
crawling
,
flying
*NL*
things
of
Judge
Miller
's
place
,
humans
included
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
,
Elmo
,
a
huge
St.
Bernard
,
had
been
the
Judge
's
inseparable
*NL*
companion
,
and
Buck
bid
fair
to
follow
in
the
way
of
his
father
.
He
was
*NL*
not
so
large
,
--
he
weighed
only
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
,
--
for
his
*NL*
mother
,
Shep
,
had
been
a
Scotch
shepherd
dog
.
Nevertheless
,
one
hundred
*NL*
and
forty
pounds
,
to
which
was
added
the
dignity
that
comes
of
good
*NL*
living
and
universal
respect
,
enabled
him
to
carry
himself
in
right
*NL*
royal
fashion
.
During
the
four
years
since
his
puppyhood
he
had
lived
*NL*
the
life
of
a
sated
aristocrat
;
he
had
a
fine
pride
in
himself
,
was
even
*NL*
a
trifle
egotistical
,
as
country
gentlemen
sometimes
become
because
of
*NL*
their
insular
situation
.
But
he
had
saved
himself
by
not
becoming
a
mere
*NL*
pampered
house-dog
.
Hunting
and
kindred
outdoor
delights
had
kept
down
*NL*
the
fat
and
hardened
his
muscles
;
and
to
him
,
as
to
the
cold-tubbing
*NL*
races
,
the
love
of
water
had
been
a
tonic
and
a
health
preserver
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
the
manner
of
dog
Buck
was
in
the
fall
of
1897
,
when
the
*NL*
Klondike
strike
dragged
men
from
all
the
world
into
the
frozen
North
.
*NL*
But
Buck
did
not
read
the
newspapers
,
and
he
did
not
know
that
Manuel
,
*NL*
one
of
the
gardener
's
helpers
,
was
an
undesirable
acquaintance
.
Manuel
*NL*
had
one
besetting
sin
.
He
loved
to
play
Chinese
lottery
.
Also
,
in
his
*NL*
gambling
,
he
had
one
besetting
weakness
--
faith
in
a
system
;
and
this
*NL*
made
his
damnation
certain
.
For
to
play
a
system
requires
money
,
while
*NL*
the
wages
of
a
gardener
's
helper
do
not
lap
over
the
needs
of
a
wife
and
*NL*
numerous
progeny
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judge
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
Raisin
Growers
'
Association
,
and
the
*NL*
boys
were
busy
organizing
an
athletic
club
,
on
the
memorable
night
of
*NL*
Manuel
's
treachery
.
No
one
saw
him
and
Buck
go
off
through
the
orchard
*NL*
on
what
Buck
imagined
was
merely
a
stroll
.
And
with
the
exception
of
a
*NL*
solitary
man
,
no
one
saw
them
arrive
at
the
little
flag
station
known
*NL*
as
College
Park
.
This
man
talked
with
Manuel
,
and
money
chinked
between
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
wrap
up
the
goods
before
you
deliver
'm
,
''
the
stranger
said
*NL*
gruffly
,
and
Manuel
doubled
a
piece
of
stout
rope
around
Buck
's
neck
*NL*
under
the
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twist
it
,
an
'
you
'll
choke
'm
plentee
,
''
said
Manuel
,
and
the
stranger
*NL*
grunted
a
ready
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
had
accepted
the
rope
with
quiet
dignity
.
To
be
sure
,
it
was
an
*NL*
unwonted
performance
:
but
he
had
learned
to
trust
in
men
he
knew
,
and
to
*NL*
give
them
credit
for
a
wisdom
that
outreached
his
own
.
But
when
the
ends
*NL*
of
the
rope
were
placed
in
the
stranger
's
hands
,
he
growled
menacingly
.
*NL*
He
had
merely
intimated
his
displeasure
,
in
his
pride
believing
that
to
*NL*
intimate
was
to
command
.
But
to
his
surprise
the
rope
tightened
around
*NL*
his
neck
,
shutting
off
his
breath
.
In
quick
rage
he
sprang
at
the
man
,
*NL*
who
met
him
halfway
,
grappled
him
close
by
the
throat
,
and
with
a
deft
*NL*
twist
threw
him
over
on
his
back
.
Then
the
rope
tightened
mercilessly
,
*NL*
while
Buck
struggled
in
a
fury
,
his
tongue
lolling
out
of
his
mouth
and
*NL*
his
great
chest
panting
futilely
.
Never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
*NL*
vilely
treated
,
and
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
angry
.
But
his
*NL*
strength
ebbed
,
his
eyes
glazed
,
and
he
knew
nothing
when
the
train
was
*NL*
flagged
and
the
two
men
threw
him
into
the
baggage
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
he
knew
,
he
was
dimly
aware
that
his
tongue
was
hurting
and
*NL*
that
he
was
being
jolted
along
in
some
kind
of
a
conveyance
.
The
hoarse
*NL*
shriek
of
a
locomotive
whistling
a
crossing
told
him
where
he
was
.
He
*NL*
had
travelled
too
often
with
the
Judge
not
to
know
the
sensation
of
*NL*
riding
in
a
baggage
car
.
He
opened
his
eyes
,
and
into
them
came
the
*NL*
unbridled
anger
of
a
kidnapped
king
.
The
man
sprang
for
his
throat
,
but
*NL*
Buck
was
too
quick
for
him
.
His
jaws
closed
on
the
hand
,
nor
did
they
*NL*
relax
till
his
senses
were
choked
out
of
him
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yep
,
has
fits
,
''
the
man
said
,
hiding
his
mangled
hand
from
the
*NL*
baggageman
,
who
had
been
attracted
by
the
sounds
of
struggle
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
takin
'
'm
up
for
the
boss
to
`
Frisco
.
A
crack
dog-doctor
there
thinks
*NL*
that
he
can
cure
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Concerning
that
night
's
ride
,
the
man
spoke
most
eloquently
for
himself
,
*NL*
in
a
little
shed
back
of
a
saloon
on
the
San
Francisco
water
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
get
is
fifty
for
it
,
''
he
grumbled
;
``
an
'
I
would
n't
do
it
over
for
*NL*
a
thousand
,
cold
cash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
was
wrapped
in
a
bloody
handkerchief
,
and
the
right
trouser
leg
*NL*
was
ripped
from
knee
to
ankle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
did
the
other
mug
get
?
''
the
saloon-keeper
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
Would
n't
take
a
sou
less
,
so
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
''
the
saloon-keeper
calculated
;
``
and
*NL*
he
's
worth
it
,
or
I
'm
a
squarehead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
kidnapper
undid
the
bloody
wrappings
and
looked
at
his
lacerated
*NL*
hand
.
``
If
I
do
n't
get
the
hydrophoby
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
because
you
was
born
to
hang
,
''
laughed
the
saloon-keeper
.
*NL*
``
Here
,
lend
me
a
hand
before
you
pull
your
freight
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dazed
,
suffering
intolerable
pain
from
throat
and
tongue
,
with
the
life
*NL*
half
throttled
out
of
him
,
Buck
attempted
to
face
his
tormentors
.
But
he
*NL*
was
thrown
down
and
choked
repeatedly
,
till
they
succeeded
in
filing
the
*NL*
heavy
brass
collar
from
off
his
neck
.
Then
the
rope
was
removed
,
and
he
*NL*
was
flung
into
a
cagelike
crate
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
lay
for
the
remainder
of
the
weary
night
,
nursing
his
wrath
and
*NL*
wounded
pride
.
He
could
not
understand
what
it
all
meant
.
What
did
they
*NL*
want
with
him
,
these
strange
men
?
Why
were
they
keeping
him
pent
up
in
*NL*
this
narrow
crate
?
He
did
not
know
why
,
but
he
felt
oppressed
by
the
*NL*
vague
sense
of
impending
calamity
.
Several
times
during
the
night
he
*NL*
sprang
to
his
feet
when
the
shed
door
rattled
open
,
expecting
to
see
the
*NL*
Judge
,
or
the
boys
at
least
.
But
each
time
it
was
the
bulging
face
of
*NL*
the
saloon-keeper
that
peered
in
at
him
by
the
sickly
light
of
a
tallow
*NL*
candle
.
And
each
time
the
joyful
bark
that
trembled
in
Buck
's
throat
was
*NL*
twisted
into
a
savage
growl
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
saloon-keeper
let
him
alone
,
and
in
the
morning
four
men
entered
*NL*
and
picked
up
the
crate
.
More
tormentors
,
Buck
decided
,
for
they
were
*NL*
evil-looking
creatures
,
ragged
and
unkempt
;
and
he
stormed
and
raged
at
*NL*
them
through
the
bars
.
They
only
laughed
and
poked
sticks
at
him
,
which
*NL*
he
promptly
assailed
with
his
teeth
till
he
realized
that
that
was
what
*NL*
they
wanted
.
Whereupon
he
lay
down
sullenly
and
allowed
the
crate
to
be
*NL*
lifted
into
a
wagon
.
Then
he
,
and
the
crate
in
which
he
was
imprisoned
,
*NL*
began
a
passage
through
many
hands
.
Clerks
in
the
express
office
took
*NL*
charge
of
him
;
he
was
carted
about
in
another
wagon
;
a
truck
carried
*NL*
him
,
with
an
assortment
of
boxes
and
parcels
,
upon
a
ferry
steamer
;
he
*NL*
was
trucked
off
the
steamer
into
a
great
railway
depot
,
and
finally
he
*NL*
was
deposited
in
an
express
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
days
and
nights
this
express
car
was
dragged
along
at
the
tail
*NL*
of
shrieking
locomotives
;
and
for
two
days
and
nights
Buck
neither
ate
*NL*
nor
drank
.
In
his
anger
he
had
met
the
first
advances
of
the
express
*NL*
messengers
with
growls
,
and
they
had
retaliated
by
teasing
him
.
When
he
*NL*
flung
himself
against
the
bars
,
quivering
and
frothing
,
they
laughed
*NL*
at
him
and
taunted
him
.
They
growled
and
barked
like
detestable
dogs
,
*NL*
mewed
,
and
flapped
their
arms
and
crowed
.
It
was
all
very
silly
,
he
*NL*
knew
;
but
therefore
the
more
outrage
to
his
dignity
,
and
his
anger
waxed
*NL*
and
waxed
.
He
did
not
mind
the
hunger
so
much
,
but
the
lack
of
water
*NL*
caused
him
severe
suffering
and
fanned
his
wrath
to
fever-pitch
.
For
*NL*
that
matter
,
high-strung
and
finely
sensitive
,
the
ill
treatment
had
*NL*
flung
him
into
a
fever
,
which
was
fed
by
the
inflammation
of
his
parched
*NL*
and
swollen
throat
and
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
glad
for
one
thing
:
the
rope
was
off
his
neck
.
That
had
given
*NL*
them
an
unfair
advantage
;
but
now
that
it
was
off
,
he
would
show
them
.
*NL*
They
would
never
get
another
rope
around
his
neck
.
Upon
that
he
was
*NL*
resolved
.
For
two
days
and
nights
he
neither
ate
nor
drank
,
and
during
*NL*
those
two
days
and
nights
of
torment
,
he
accumulated
a
fund
of
wrath
*NL*
that
boded
ill
for
whoever
first
fell
foul
of
him
.
His
eyes
turned
*NL*
blood-shot
,
and
he
was
metamorphosed
into
a
raging
fiend
.
So
changed
was
*NL*
he
that
the
Judge
himself
would
not
have
recognized
him
;
and
the
express
*NL*
messengers
breathed
with
relief
when
they
bundled
him
off
the
train
at
*NL*
Seattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
men
gingerly
carried
the
crate
from
the
wagon
into
a
small
,
*NL*
high-walled
back
yard
.
A
stout
man
,
with
a
red
sweater
that
sagged
*NL*
generously
at
the
neck
,
came
out
and
signed
the
book
for
the
driver
.
*NL*
That
was
the
man
,
Buck
divined
,
the
next
tormentor
,
and
he
hurled
*NL*
himself
savagely
against
the
bars
.
The
man
smiled
grimly
,
and
brought
a
*NL*
hatchet
and
a
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ai
n't
going
to
take
him
out
now
?
''
the
driver
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
the
man
replied
,
driving
the
hatchet
into
the
crate
for
a
pry
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
instantaneous
scattering
of
the
four
men
who
had
carried
*NL*
it
in
,
and
from
safe
perches
on
top
the
wall
they
prepared
to
watch
the
*NL*
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
rushed
at
the
splintering
wood
,
sinking
his
teeth
into
it
,
surging
*NL*
and
wrestling
with
it
.
Wherever
the
hatchet
fell
on
the
outside
,
he
was
*NL*
there
on
the
inside
,
snarling
and
growling
,
as
furiously
anxious
to
get
*NL*
out
as
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
was
calmly
intent
on
getting
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
red-eyed
devil
,
''
he
said
,
when
he
had
made
an
opening
*NL*
sufficient
for
the
passage
of
Buck
's
body
.
At
the
same
time
he
dropped
*NL*
the
hatchet
and
shifted
the
club
to
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Buck
was
truly
a
red-eyed
devil
,
as
he
drew
himself
together
for
the
*NL*
spring
,
hair
bristling
,
mouth
foaming
,
a
mad
glitter
in
his
blood-shot
*NL*
eyes
.
Straight
at
the
man
he
launched
his
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
*NL*
of
fury
,
surcharged
with
the
pent
passion
of
two
days
and
nights
.
In
*NL*
mid
air
,
just
as
his
jaws
were
about
to
close
on
the
man
,
he
received
*NL*
a
shock
that
checked
his
body
and
brought
his
teeth
together
with
an
*NL*
agonizing
clip
.
He
whirled
over
,
fetching
the
ground
on
his
back
and
*NL*
side
.
He
had
never
been
struck
by
a
club
in
his
life
,
and
did
not
*NL*
understand
.
With
a
snarl
that
was
part
bark
and
more
scream
he
was
again
*NL*
on
his
feet
and
launched
into
the
air
.
And
again
the
shock
came
and
he
*NL*
was
brought
crushingly
to
the
ground
.
This
time
he
was
aware
that
it
was
*NL*
the
club
,
but
his
madness
knew
no
caution
.
A
dozen
times
he
charged
,
and
*NL*
as
often
the
club
broke
the
charge
and
smashed
him
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
particularly
fierce
blow
,
he
crawled
to
his
feet
,
too
dazed
to
*NL*
rush
.
He
staggered
limply
about
,
the
blood
flowing
from
nose
and
mouth
*NL*
and
ears
,
his
beautiful
coat
sprayed
and
flecked
with
bloody
slaver
.
*NL*
Then
the
man
advanced
and
deliberately
dealt
him
a
frightful
blow
on
*NL*
the
nose
.
All
the
pain
he
had
endured
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
*NL*
exquisite
agony
of
this
.
With
a
roar
that
was
almost
lionlike
in
its
*NL*
ferocity
,
he
again
hurled
himself
at
the
man
.
But
the
man
,
shifting
the
*NL*
club
from
right
to
left
,
coolly
caught
him
by
the
under
jaw
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
wrenching
downward
and
backward
.
Buck
described
a
complete
circle
*NL*
in
the
air
,
and
half
of
another
,
then
crashed
to
the
ground
on
his
head
*NL*
and
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
time
he
rushed
.
The
man
struck
the
shrewd
blow
he
had
*NL*
purposely
withheld
for
so
long
,
and
Buck
crumpled
up
and
went
down
,
*NL*
knocked
utterly
senseless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
no
slouch
at
dog-breakin
'
,
that
's
wot
I
say
,
''
one
of
the
men
on
*NL*
the
wall
cried
enthusiastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Druther
break
cayuses
any
day
,
and
twice
on
Sundays
,
''
was
the
reply
of
*NL*
the
driver
,
as
he
climbed
on
the
wagon
and
started
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
's
senses
came
back
to
him
,
but
not
his
strength
.
He
lay
where
he
*NL*
had
fallen
,
and
from
there
he
watched
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Answers
to
the
name
of
Buck
,
'
''
the
man
soliloquized
,
quoting
from
the
*NL*
saloon-keeper
's
letter
which
had
announced
the
consignment
of
the
crate
*NL*
and
contents
.
``
Well
,
Buck
,
my
boy
,
''
he
went
on
in
a
genial
voice
,
``
we
've
*NL*
had
our
little
ruction
,
and
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
let
it
go
at
*NL*
that
.
You
've
learned
your
place
,
and
I
know
mine
.
Be
a
good
dog
and
all
*NL*
'll
go
well
and
the
goose
hang
high
.
Be
a
bad
dog
,
and
I
'll
whale
the
*NL*
stuffin
'
outa
you
.
Understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
he
fearlessly
patted
the
head
he
had
so
mercilessly
pounded
,
*NL*
and
though
Buck
's
hair
involuntarily
bristled
at
touch
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
he
endured
it
without
protest
.
When
the
man
brought
him
water
he
drank
*NL*
eagerly
,
and
later
bolted
a
generous
meal
of
raw
meat
,
chunk
by
chunk
,
*NL*
from
the
man
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
beaten
-LRB-
he
knew
that
-RRB-
;
but
he
was
not
broken
.
He
saw
,
once
for
*NL*
all
,
that
he
stood
no
chance
against
a
man
with
a
club
.
He
had
learned
*NL*
the
lesson
,
and
in
all
his
after
life
he
never
forgot
it
.
That
club
was
*NL*
a
revelation
.
It
was
his
introduction
to
the
reign
of
primitive
law
,
*NL*
and
he
met
the
introduction
halfway
.
The
facts
of
life
took
on
a
fiercer
*NL*
aspect
;
and
while
he
faced
that
aspect
uncowed
,
he
faced
it
with
all
the
*NL*
latent
cunning
of
his
nature
aroused
.
As
the
days
went
by
,
other
dogs
*NL*
came
,
in
crates
and
at
the
ends
of
ropes
,
some
docilely
,
and
some
raging
*NL*
and
roaring
as
he
had
come
;
and
,
one
and
all
,
he
watched
them
pass
*NL*
under
the
dominion
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
.
Again
and
again
,
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
each
brutal
performance
,
the
lesson
was
driven
home
to
Buck
:
*NL*
a
man
with
a
club
was
a
lawgiver
,
a
master
to
be
obeyed
,
though
not
*NL*
necessarily
conciliated
.
Of
this
last
Buck
was
never
guilty
,
though
he
*NL*
did
see
beaten
dogs
that
fawned
upon
the
man
,
and
wagged
their
tails
,
*NL*
and
licked
his
hand
.
Also
he
saw
one
dog
,
that
would
neither
conciliate
*NL*
nor
obey
,
finally
killed
in
the
struggle
for
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
again
men
came
,
strangers
,
who
talked
excitedly
,
wheedlingly
,
*NL*
and
in
all
kinds
of
fashions
to
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
.
And
at
such
*NL*
times
that
money
passed
between
them
the
strangers
took
one
or
more
of
*NL*
the
dogs
away
with
them
.
Buck
wondered
where
they
went
,
for
they
never
*NL*
came
back
;
but
the
fear
of
the
future
was
strong
upon
him
,
and
he
was
*NL*
glad
each
time
when
he
was
not
selected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
his
time
came
,
in
the
end
,
in
the
form
of
a
little
weazened
man
who
*NL*
spat
broken
English
and
many
strange
and
uncouth
exclamations
which
Buck
*NL*
could
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sacredam
!
''
he
cried
,
when
his
eyes
lit
upon
Buck
.
``
Dat
one
dam
bully
*NL*
dog
!
Eh
?
How
moch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
,
and
a
present
at
that
,
''
was
the
prompt
reply
of
the
man
*NL*
in
the
red
sweater
.
``
And
seem
'
it
's
government
money
,
you
ai
n't
got
no
*NL*
kick
coming
,
eh
,
Perrault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perrault
grinned
.
Considering
that
the
price
of
dogs
had
been
boomed
*NL*
skyward
by
the
unwonted
demand
,
it
was
not
an
unfair
sum
for
so
fine
*NL*
an
animal
.
The
Canadian
Government
would
be
no
loser
,
nor
would
its
*NL*
despatches
travel
the
slower
.
Perrault
knew
dogs
,
and
when
he
looked
at
*NL*
Buck
he
knew
that
he
was
one
in
a
thousand
--
``
One
in
ten
t
`
ousand
,
''
he
*NL*
commented
mentally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
saw
money
pass
between
them
,
and
was
not
surprised
when
Curly
,
a
*NL*
good-natured
Newfoundland
,
and
he
were
led
away
by
the
little
weazened
*NL*
man
.
That
was
the
last
he
saw
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
,
and
as
*NL*
Curly
and
he
looked
at
receding
Seattle
from
the
deck
of
the
Narwhal
,
it
*NL*
was
the
last
he
saw
of
the
warm
Southland
.
Curly
and
he
were
taken
below
*NL*
by
Perrault
and
turned
over
to
a
black-faced
giant
called
Francois
.
*NL*
Perrault
was
a
French-Canadian
,
and
swarthy
;
but
Francois
was
a
*NL*
French-Canadian
half-breed
,
and
twice
as
swarthy
.
They
were
a
new
kind
*NL*
of
men
to
Buck
-LRB-
of
which
he
was
destined
to
see
many
more
-RRB-
,
and
while
*NL*
he
developed
no
affection
for
them
,
he
none
the
less
grew
honestly
to
*NL*
respect
them
.
He
speedily
learned
that
Perrault
and
Francois
were
fair
*NL*
men
,
calm
and
impartial
in
administering
justice
,
and
too
wise
in
the
*NL*
way
of
dogs
to
be
fooled
by
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
`
tween-decks
of
the
Narwhal
,
Buck
and
Curly
joined
two
other
*NL*
dogs
.
One
of
them
was
a
big
,
snow-white
fellow
from
Spitzbergen
who
had
*NL*
been
brought
away
by
a
whaling
captain
,
and
who
had
later
accompanied
*NL*
a
Geological
Survey
into
the
Barrens
.
He
was
friendly
,
in
a
treacherous
*NL*
sort
of
way
,
smiling
into
one
's
face
the
while
he
meditated
some
*NL*
underhand
trick
,
as
,
for
instance
,
when
he
stole
from
Buck
's
food
at
the
*NL*
first
meal
.
As
Buck
sprang
to
punish
him
,
the
lash
of
Francois
's
whip
*NL*
sang
through
the
air
,
reaching
the
culprit
first
;
and
nothing
remained
*NL*
to
Buck
but
to
recover
the
bone
.
That
was
fair
of
Francois
,
he
decided
,
*NL*
and
the
half-breed
began
his
rise
in
Buck
's
estimation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
dog
made
no
advances
,
nor
received
any
;
also
,
he
did
not
*NL*
attempt
to
steal
from
the
newcomers
.
He
was
a
gloomy
,
morose
fellow
,
and
*NL*
he
showed
Curly
plainly
that
all
he
desired
was
to
be
left
alone
,
and
*NL*
further
,
that
there
would
be
trouble
if
he
were
not
left
alone
.
``
Dave
''
*NL*
he
was
called
,
and
he
ate
and
slept
,
or
yawned
between
times
,
and
took
*NL*
interest
in
nothing
,
not
even
when
the
Narwhal
crossed
Queen
Charlotte
*NL*
Sound
and
rolled
and
pitched
and
bucked
like
a
thing
possessed
.
When
*NL*
Buck
and
Curly
grew
excited
,
half
wild
with
fear
,
he
raised
his
head
as
*NL*
though
annoyed
,
favored
them
with
an
incurious
glance
,
yawned
,
and
went
*NL*
to
sleep
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
and
night
the
ship
throbbed
to
the
tireless
pulse
of
the
propeller
,
*NL*
and
though
one
day
was
very
like
another
,
it
was
apparent
to
Buck
that
*NL*
the
weather
was
steadily
growing
colder
.
At
last
,
one
morning
,
the
*NL*
propeller
was
quiet
,
and
the
Narwhal
was
pervaded
with
an
atmosphere
of
*NL*
excitement
.
He
felt
it
,
as
did
the
other
dogs
,
and
knew
that
a
change
*NL*
was
at
hand
.
Francois
leashed
them
and
brought
them
on
deck
.
At
the
*NL*
first
step
upon
the
cold
surface
,
Buck
's
feet
sank
into
a
white
mushy
*NL*
something
very
like
mud
.
He
sprang
back
with
a
snort
.
More
of
this
white
*NL*
stuff
was
falling
through
the
air
.
He
shook
himself
,
but
more
of
it
fell
*NL*
upon
him
.
He
sniffed
it
curiously
,
then
licked
some
up
on
his
tongue
.
It
*NL*
bit
like
fire
,
and
the
next
instant
was
gone
.
This
puzzled
him
.
He
tried
*NL*
it
again
,
with
the
same
result
.
The
onlookers
laughed
uproariously
,
and
*NL*
he
felt
ashamed
,
he
knew
not
why
,
for
it
was
his
first
snow
.

Chapter
II
.
The
Law
of
Club
and
Fang
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
's
first
day
on
the
Dyea
beach
was
like
a
nightmare
.
Every
hour
was
*NL*
filled
with
shock
and
surprise
.
He
had
been
suddenly
jerked
from
the
*NL*
heart
of
civilization
and
flung
into
the
heart
of
things
primordial
.
*NL*
No
lazy
,
sun-kissed
life
was
this
,
with
nothing
to
do
but
loaf
and
be
*NL*
bored
.
Here
was
neither
peace
,
nor
rest
,
nor
a
moment
's
safety
.
All
*NL*
was
confusion
and
action
,
and
every
moment
life
and
limb
were
in
peril
.
*NL*
There
was
imperative
need
to
be
constantly
alert
;
for
these
dogs
and
men
*NL*
were
not
town
dogs
and
men
.
They
were
savages
,
all
of
them
,
who
knew
no
*NL*
law
but
the
law
of
club
and
fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
seen
dogs
fight
as
these
wolfish
creatures
fought
,
and
his
*NL*
first
experience
taught
him
an
unforgetable
lesson
.
It
is
true
,
it
was
*NL*
a
vicarious
experience
,
else
he
would
not
have
lived
to
profit
by
it
.
*NL*
Curly
was
the
victim
.
They
were
camped
near
the
log
store
,
where
she
,
in
*NL*
her
friendly
way
,
made
advances
to
a
husky
dog
the
size
of
a
full-grown
*NL*
wolf
,
though
not
half
so
large
as
she
.
There
was
no
warning
,
only
a
leap
*NL*
in
like
a
flash
,
a
metallic
clip
of
teeth
,
a
leap
out
equally
swift
,
and
*NL*
Curly
's
face
was
ripped
open
from
eye
to
jaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
wolf
manner
of
fighting
,
to
strike
and
leap
away
;
but
there
*NL*
was
more
to
it
than
this
.
Thirty
or
forty
huskies
ran
to
the
spot
and
*NL*
surrounded
the
combatants
in
an
intent
and
silent
circle
.
Buck
did
not
*NL*
comprehend
that
silent
intentness
,
nor
the
eager
way
with
which
they
*NL*
were
licking
their
chops
.
Curly
rushed
her
antagonist
,
who
struck
again
*NL*
and
leaped
aside
.
He
met
her
next
rush
with
his
chest
,
in
a
peculiar
*NL*
fashion
that
tumbled
her
off
her
feet
.
She
never
regained
them
,
This
*NL*
was
what
the
onlooking
huskies
had
waited
for
.
They
closed
in
upon
her
,
*NL*
snarling
and
yelping
,
and
she
was
buried
,
screaming
with
agony
,
beneath
*NL*
the
bristling
mass
of
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
sudden
was
it
,
and
so
unexpected
,
that
Buck
was
taken
aback
.
He
saw
*NL*
Spitz
run
out
his
scarlet
tongue
in
a
way
he
had
of
laughing
;
and
he
saw
*NL*
Francois
,
swinging
an
axe
,
spring
into
the
mess
of
dogs
.
Three
men
*NL*
with
clubs
were
helping
him
to
scatter
them
.
It
did
not
take
long
.
Two
*NL*
minutes
from
the
time
Curly
went
down
,
the
last
of
her
assailants
were
*NL*
clubbed
off
.
But
she
lay
there
limp
and
lifeless
in
the
bloody
,
trampled
*NL*
snow
,
almost
literally
torn
to
pieces
,
the
swart
half-breed
standing
*NL*
over
her
and
cursing
horribly
.
The
scene
often
came
back
to
Buck
to
*NL*
trouble
him
in
his
sleep
.
So
that
was
the
way
.
No
fair
play
.
Once
down
,
*NL*
that
was
the
end
of
you
.
Well
,
he
would
see
to
it
that
he
never
went
*NL*
down
.
Spitz
ran
out
his
tongue
and
laughed
again
,
and
from
that
moment
*NL*
Buck
hated
him
with
a
bitter
and
deathless
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
had
recovered
from
the
shock
caused
by
the
tragic
passing
*NL*
of
Curly
,
he
received
another
shock
.
Francois
fastened
upon
him
an
*NL*
arrangement
of
straps
and
buckles
.
It
was
a
harness
,
such
as
he
had
seen
*NL*
the
grooms
put
on
the
horses
at
home
.
And
as
he
had
seen
horses
work
,
*NL*
so
he
was
set
to
work
,
hauling
Francois
on
a
sled
to
the
forest
that
*NL*
fringed
the
valley
,
and
returning
with
a
load
of
firewood
.
Though
his
*NL*
dignity
was
sorely
hurt
by
thus
being
made
a
draught
animal
,
he
was
too
*NL*
wise
to
rebel
.
He
buckled
down
with
a
will
and
did
his
best
,
though
*NL*
it
was
all
new
and
strange
.
Francois
was
stern
,
demanding
instant
*NL*
obedience
,
and
by
virtue
of
his
whip
receiving
instant
obedience
;
*NL*
while
Dave
,
who
was
an
experienced
wheeler
,
nipped
Buck
's
hind
quarters
*NL*
whenever
he
was
in
error
.
Spitz
was
the
leader
,
likewise
experienced
,
*NL*
and
while
he
could
not
always
get
at
Buck
,
he
growled
sharp
reproof
now
*NL*
and
again
,
or
cunningly
threw
his
weight
in
the
traces
to
jerk
Buck
*NL*
into
the
way
he
should
go
.
Buck
learned
easily
,
and
under
the
combined
*NL*
tuition
of
his
two
mates
and
Francois
made
remarkable
progress
.
Ere
they
*NL*
returned
to
camp
he
knew
enough
to
stop
at
``
ho
,
''
to
go
ahead
at
``
mush
,
''
*NL*
to
swing
wide
on
the
bends
,
and
to
keep
clear
of
the
wheeler
when
the
*NL*
loaded
sled
shot
downhill
at
their
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T'ree
vair
'
good
dogs
,
''
Francois
told
Perrault
.
``
Dat
Buck
,
heem
pool
*NL*
lak
hell
.
I
tich
heem
queek
as
anyt
`
ing

''
*NL*
*NL*
By
afternoon
,
Perrault
,
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
on
the
trail
with
his
*NL*
despatches
,
returned
with
two
more
dogs
.
``
Billee
''
and
``
Joe
''
he
called
*NL*
them
,
two
brothers
,
and
true
huskies
both
.
Sons
of
the
one
mother
though
*NL*
they
were
,
they
were
as
different
as
day
and
night
.
Billee
's
one
fault
*NL*
was
his
excessive
good
nature
,
while
Joe
was
the
very
opposite
,
sour
and
*NL*
introspective
,
with
a
perpetual
snarl
and
a
malignant
eye
.
Buck
received
*NL*
them
in
comradely
fashion
,
Dave
ignored
them
,
while
Spitz
proceeded
to
*NL*
thrash
first
one
and
then
the
other
.
Billee
wagged
his
tail
appeasingly
,
*NL*
turned
to
run
when
he
saw
that
appeasement
was
of
no
avail
,
and
cried
*NL*
-LRB-
still
appeasingly
-RRB-
when
Spitz
's
sharp
teeth
scored
his
flank
.
But
no
*NL*
matter
how
Spitz
circled
,
Joe
whirled
around
on
his
heels
to
face
*NL*
him
,
mane
bristling
,
ears
laid
back
,
lips
writhing
and
snarling
,
jaws
*NL*
clipping
together
as
fast
as
he
could
snap
,
and
eyes
diabolically
*NL*
gleaming
--
the
incarnation
of
belligerent
fear
.
So
terrible
was
his
*NL*
appearance
that
Spitz
was
forced
to
forego
disciplining
him
;
but
to
*NL*
cover
his
own
discomfiture
he
turned
upon
the
inoffensive
and
wailing
*NL*
Billee
and
drove
him
to
the
confines
of
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
evening
Perrault
secured
another
dog
,
an
old
husky
,
long
and
lean
*NL*
and
gaunt
,
with
a
battle-scarred
face
and
a
single
eye
which
flashed
a
*NL*
warning
of
prowess
that
commanded
respect
.
He
was
called
Sol-leks
,
which
*NL*
means
the
Angry
One
.
Like
Dave
,
he
asked
nothing
,
gave
nothing
,
expected
*NL*
nothing
;
and
when
he
marched
slowly
and
deliberately
into
their
midst
,
*NL*
even
Spitz
left
him
alone
.
He
had
one
peculiarity
which
Buck
was
unlucky
*NL*
enough
to
discover
.
He
did
not
like
to
be
approached
on
his
blind
side
.
*NL*
Of
this
offence
Buck
was
unwittingly
guilty
,
and
the
first
knowledge
he
*NL*
had
of
his
indiscretion
was
when
Sol-leks
whirled
upon
him
and
slashed
*NL*
his
shoulder
to
the
bone
for
three
inches
up
and
down
.
Forever
after
*NL*
Buck
avoided
his
blind
side
,
and
to
the
last
of
their
comradeship
had
*NL*
no
more
trouble
.
His
only
apparent
ambition
,
like
Dave
's
,
was
to
be
left
*NL*
alone
;
though
,
as
Buck
was
afterward
to
learn
,
each
of
them
possessed
*NL*
one
other
and
even
more
vital
ambition
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Buck
faced
the
great
problem
of
sleeping
.
The
tent
,
illumined
*NL*
by
a
candle
,
glowed
warmly
in
the
midst
of
the
white
plain
;
and
when
he
,
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
course
,
entered
it
,
both
Perrault
and
Francois
bombarded
*NL*
him
with
curses
and
cooking
utensils
,
till
he
recovered
from
his
*NL*
consternation
and
fled
ignominiously
into
the
outer
cold
.
A
chill
wind
*NL*
was
blowing
that
nipped
him
sharply
and
bit
with
especial
venom
into
his
*NL*
wounded
shoulder
.
He
lay
down
on
the
snow
and
attempted
to
sleep
,
*NL*
but
the
frost
soon
drove
him
shivering
to
his
feet
.
Miserable
and
*NL*
disconsolate
,
he
wandered
about
among
the
many
tents
,
only
to
find
that
*NL*
one
place
was
as
cold
as
another
.
Here
and
there
savage
dogs
rushed
*NL*
upon
him
,
but
he
bristled
his
neck-hair
and
snarled
-LRB-
for
he
was
learning
*NL*
fast
-RRB-
,
and
they
let
him
go
his
way
unmolested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
an
idea
came
to
him
.
He
would
return
and
see
how
his
own
*NL*
team-mates
were
making
out
.
To
his
astonishment
,
they
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
Again
he
wandered
about
through
the
great
camp
,
looking
for
them
,
and
*NL*
again
he
returned
.
Were
they
in
the
tent
?
No
,
that
could
not
be
,
else
he
*NL*
would
not
have
been
driven
out
.
Then
where
could
they
possibly
be
?
With
*NL*
drooping
tail
and
shivering
body
,
very
forlorn
indeed
,
he
aimlessly
*NL*
circled
the
tent
.
Suddenly
the
snow
gave
way
beneath
his
fore
legs
*NL*
and
he
sank
down
.
Something
wriggled
under
his
feet
.
He
sprang
back
,
*NL*
bristling
and
snarling
,
fearful
of
the
unseen
and
unknown
.
But
a
*NL*
friendly
little
yelp
reassured
him
,
and
he
went
back
to
investigate
.
A
*NL*
whiff
of
warm
air
ascended
to
his
nostrils
,
and
there
,
curled
up
under
*NL*
the
snow
in
a
snug
ball
,
lay
Billee
.
He
whined
placatingly
,
squirmed
and
*NL*
wriggled
to
show
his
good
will
and
intentions
,
and
even
ventured
,
as
a
*NL*
bribe
for
peace
,
to
lick
Buck
's
face
with
his
warm
wet
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
lesson
.
So
that
was
the
way
they
did
it
,
eh
?
Buck
confidently
*NL*
selected
a
spot
,
and
with
much
fuss
and
waste
effort
proceeded
to
dig
a
*NL*
hole
for
himself
.
In
a
trice
the
heat
from
his
body
filled
the
confined
*NL*
space
and
he
was
asleep
.
The
day
had
been
long
and
arduous
,
and
he
slept
*NL*
soundly
and
comfortably
,
though
he
growled
and
barked
and
wrestled
with
*NL*
bad
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
he
open
his
eyes
till
roused
by
the
noises
of
the
waking
camp
.
*NL*
At
first
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
.
It
had
snowed
during
the
night
*NL*
and
he
was
completely
buried
.
The
snow
walls
pressed
him
on
every
side
,
*NL*
and
a
great
surge
of
fear
swept
through
him
--
the
fear
of
the
wild
thing
*NL*
for
the
trap
.
It
was
a
token
that
he
was
harking
back
through
his
own
*NL*
life
to
the
lives
of
his
forebears
;
for
he
was
a
civilized
dog
,
an
*NL*
unduly
civilized
dog
,
and
of
his
own
experience
knew
no
trap
and
so
*NL*
could
not
of
himself
fear
it
.
The
muscles
of
his
whole
body
contracted
*NL*
spasmodically
and
instinctively
,
the
hair
on
his
neck
and
shoulders
*NL*
stood
on
end
,
and
with
a
ferocious
snarl
he
bounded
straight
up
into
*NL*
the
blinding
day
,
the
snow
flying
about
him
in
a
flashing
cloud
.
Ere
he
*NL*
landed
on
his
feet
,
he
saw
the
white
camp
spread
out
before
him
and
knew
*NL*
where
he
was
and
remembered
all
that
had
passed
from
the
time
he
went
*NL*
for
a
stroll
with
Manuel
to
the
hole
he
had
dug
for
himself
the
night
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shout
from
Francois
hailed
his
appearance
.
``
Wot
I
say
?
''
the
dog-driver
*NL*
cried
to
Perrault
.
``
Dat
Buck
for
sure
learn
queek
as
anyt
`
ing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perrault
nodded
gravely
.
As
courier
for
the
Canadian
Government
,
bearing
*NL*
important
despatches
,
he
was
anxious
to
secure
the
best
dogs
,
and
he
was
*NL*
particularly
gladdened
by
the
possession
of
Buck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
more
huskies
were
added
to
the
team
inside
an
hour
,
making
a
total
*NL*
of
nine
,
and
before
another
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
they
were
in
*NL*
harness
and
swinging
up
the
trail
toward
the
Dyea
Canon
.
Buck
was
*NL*
glad
to
be
gone
,
and
though
the
work
was
hard
he
found
he
did
not
*NL*
particularly
despise
it
.
He
was
surprised
at
the
eagerness
which
*NL*
animated
the
whole
team
and
which
was
communicated
to
him
;
but
still
*NL*
more
surprising
was
the
change
wrought
in
Dave
and
Sol-leks
.
They
*NL*
were
new
dogs
,
utterly
transformed
by
the
harness
.
All
passiveness
and
*NL*
unconcern
had
dropped
from
them
.
They
were
alert
and
active
,
anxious
*NL*
that
the
work
should
go
well
,
and
fiercely
irritable
with
whatever
,
by
*NL*
delay
or
confusion
,
retarded
that
work
.
The
toil
of
the
traces
seemed
*NL*
the
supreme
expression
of
their
being
,
and
all
that
they
lived
for
and
*NL*
the
only
thing
in
which
they
took
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dave
was
wheeler
or
sled
dog
,
pulling
in
front
of
him
was
Buck
,
then
*NL*
came
Sol-leks
;
the
rest
of
the
team
was
strung
out
ahead
,
single
file
,
*NL*
to
the
leader
,
which
position
was
filled
by
Spitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
had
been
purposely
placed
between
Dave
and
Sol-leks
so
that
he
*NL*
might
receive
instruction
.
Apt
scholar
that
he
was
,
they
were
equally
*NL*
apt
teachers
,
never
allowing
him
to
linger
long
in
error
,
and
enforcing
*NL*
their
teaching
with
their
sharp
teeth
.
Dave
was
fair
and
very
wise
.
He
*NL*
never
nipped
Buck
without
cause
,
and
he
never
failed
to
nip
him
when
he
*NL*
stood
in
need
of
it
.
As
Francois
's
whip
backed
him
up
,
Buck
found
it
*NL*
to
be
cheaper
to
mend
his
ways
than
to
retaliate
.
Once
,
during
a
brief
*NL*
halt
,
when
he
got
tangled
in
the
traces
and
delayed
the
start
,
both
*NL*
Dave
and
Solleks
flew
at
him
and
administered
a
sound
trouncing
.
The
*NL*
resulting
tangle
was
even
worse
,
but
Buck
took
good
care
to
keep
the
*NL*
traces
clear
thereafter
;
and
ere
the
day
was
done
,
so
well
had
he
*NL*
mastered
his
work
,
his
mates
about
ceased
nagging
him
.
Francois
's
whip
*NL*
snapped
less
frequently
,
and
Perrault
even
honored
Buck
by
lifting
up
*NL*
his
feet
and
carefully
examining
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
hard
day
's
run
,
up
the
Canon
,
through
Sheep
Camp
,
past
the
*NL*
Scales
and
the
timber
line
,
across
glaciers
and
snowdrifts
hundreds
of
*NL*
feet
deep
,
and
over
the
great
Chilcoot
Divide
,
which
stands
between
*NL*
the
salt
water
and
the
fresh
and
guards
forbiddingly
the
sad
and
lonely
*NL*
North
.
They
made
good
time
down
the
chain
of
lakes
which
fills
the
*NL*
craters
of
extinct
volcanoes
,
and
late
that
night
pulled
into
the
huge
*NL*
camp
at
the
head
of
Lake
Bennett
,
where
thousands
of
goldseekers
were
*NL*
building
boats
against
the
break-up
of
the
ice
in
the
spring
.
Buck
made
*NL*
his
hole
in
the
snow
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
exhausted
just
,
but
all
*NL*
too
early
was
routed
out
in
the
cold
darkness
and
harnessed
with
his
*NL*
mates
to
the
sled
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
they
made
forty
miles
,
the
trail
being
packed
;
but
the
next
*NL*
day
,
and
for
many
days
to
follow
,
they
broke
their
own
trail
,
worked
*NL*
harder
,
and
made
poorer
time
.
As
a
rule
,
Perrault
travelled
ahead
of
*NL*
the
team
,
packing
the
snow
with
webbed
shoes
to
make
it
easier
for
them
.
*NL*
Francois
,
guiding
the
sled
at
the
gee-pole
,
sometimes
exchanged
places
*NL*
with
him
,
but
not
often
.
Perrault
was
in
a
hurry
,
and
he
prided
himself
*NL*
on
his
knowledge
of
ice
,
which
knowledge
was
indispensable
,
for
the
fall
*NL*
ice
was
very
thin
,
and
where
there
was
swift
water
,
there
was
no
ice
at
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
after
day
,
for
days
unending
,
Buck
toiled
in
the
traces
.
Always
,
*NL*
they
broke
camp
in
the
dark
,
and
the
first
gray
of
dawn
found
them
*NL*
hitting
the
trail
with
fresh
miles
reeled
off
behind
them
.
And
always
*NL*
they
pitched
camp
after
dark
,
eating
their
bit
of
fish
,
and
crawling
*NL*
to
sleep
into
the
snow
.
Buck
was
ravenous
.
The
pound
and
a
half
of
*NL*
sun-dried
salmon
,
which
was
his
ration
for
each
day
,
seemed
to
go
*NL*
nowhere
.
He
never
had
enough
,
and
suffered
from
perpetual
hunger
pangs
.
*NL*
Yet
the
other
dogs
,
because
they
weighed
less
and
were
born
to
the
life
,
*NL*
received
a
pound
only
of
the
fish
and
managed
to
keep
in
good
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
swiftly
lost
the
fastidiousness
which
had
characterized
his
old
life
.
*NL*
A
dainty
eater
,
he
found
that
his
mates
,
finishing
first
,
robbed
him
of
*NL*
his
unfinished
ration
.
There
was
no
defending
it
.
While
he
was
fighting
*NL*
off
two
or
three
,
it
was
disappearing
down
the
throats
of
the
others
.
To
*NL*
remedy
this
,
he
ate
as
fast
as
they
;
and
,
so
greatly
did
hunger
compel
*NL*
him
,
he
was
not
above
taking
what
did
not
belong
to
him
.
He
watched
and
*NL*
learned
.
When
he
saw
Pike
,
one
of
the
new
dogs
,
a
clever
malingerer
and
*NL*
thief
,
slyly
steal
a
slice
of
bacon
when
Perrault
's
back
was
turned
,
*NL*
he
duplicated
the
performance
the
following
day
,
getting
away
with
the
*NL*
whole
chunk
.
A
great
uproar
was
raised
,
but
he
was
unsuspected
;
while
*NL*
Dub
,
an
awkward
blunderer
who
was
always
getting
caught
,
was
punished
*NL*
for
Buck
's
misdeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
theft
marked
Buck
as
fit
to
survive
in
the
hostile
Northland
*NL*
environment
.
It
marked
his
adaptability
,
his
capacity
to
adjust
himself
*NL*
to
changing
conditions
,
the
lack
of
which
would
have
meant
swift
and
*NL*
terrible
death
.
It
marked
,
further
,
the
decay
or
going
to
pieces
of
his
*NL*
moral
nature
,
a
vain
thing
and
a
handicap
in
the
ruthless
struggle
for
*NL*
existence
.
It
was
all
well
enough
in
the
Southland
,
under
the
law
of
*NL*
love
and
fellowship
,
to
respect
private
property
and
personal
feelings
;
*NL*
but
in
the
Northland
,
under
the
law
of
club
and
fang
,
whoso
took
such
*NL*
things
into
account
was
a
fool
,
and
in
so
far
as
he
observed
them
he
*NL*
would
fail
to
prosper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
Buck
reasoned
it
out
.
He
was
fit
,
that
was
all
,
and
*NL*
unconsciously
he
accommodated
himself
to
the
new
mode
of
life
.
All
his
*NL*
days
,
no
matter
what
the
odds
,
he
had
never
run
from
a
fight
.
But
*NL*
the
club
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
had
beaten
into
him
a
more
*NL*
fundamental
and
primitive
code
.
Civilized
,
he
could
have
died
for
a
*NL*
moral
consideration
,
say
the
defence
of
Judge
Miller
's
riding-whip
;
but
*NL*
the
completeness
of
his
decivilization
was
now
evidenced
by
his
ability
*NL*
to
flee
from
the
defence
of
a
moral
consideration
and
so
save
his
*NL*
hide
.
He
did
not
steal
for
joy
of
it
,
but
because
of
the
clamor
of
his
*NL*
stomach
.
He
did
not
rob
openly
,
but
stole
secretly
and
cunningly
,
out
of
*NL*
respect
for
club
and
fang
.
In
short
,
the
things
he
did
were
done
because
*NL*
it
was
easier
to
do
them
than
not
to
do
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
development
-LRB-
or
retrogression
-RRB-
was
rapid
.
His
muscles
became
hard
as
*NL*
iron
,
and
he
grew
callous
to
all
ordinary
pain
.
He
achieved
an
internal
*NL*
as
well
as
external
economy
.
He
could
eat
anything
,
no
matter
how
*NL*
loathsome
or
indigestible
;
and
,
once
eaten
,
the
juices
of
his
stomach
*NL*
extracted
the
last
least
particle
of
nutriment
;
and
his
blood
carried
it
*NL*
to
the
farthest
reaches
of
his
body
,
building
it
into
the
toughest
and
*NL*
stoutest
of
tissues
.
Sight
and
scent
became
remarkably
keen
,
while
his
*NL*
hearing
developed
such
acuteness
that
in
his
sleep
he
heard
the
faintest
*NL*
sound
and
knew
whether
it
heralded
peace
or
peril
.
He
learned
to
bite
*NL*
the
ice
out
with
his
teeth
when
it
collected
between
his
toes
;
and
when
*NL*
he
was
thirsty
and
there
was
a
thick
scum
of
ice
over
the
water
hole
,
he
*NL*
would
break
it
by
rearing
and
striking
it
with
stiff
fore
legs
.
His
most
*NL*
conspicuous
trait
was
an
ability
to
scent
the
wind
and
forecast
it
a
*NL*
night
in
advance
.
No
matter
how
breathless
the
air
when
he
dug
his
*NL*
nest
by
tree
or
bank
,
the
wind
that
later
blew
inevitably
found
him
to
*NL*
leeward
,
sheltered
and
snug
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
only
did
he
learn
by
experience
,
but
instincts
long
dead
became
*NL*
alive
again
.
The
domesticated
generations
fell
from
him
.
In
vague
ways
*NL*
he
remembered
back
to
the
youth
of
the
breed
,
to
the
time
the
wild
dogs
*NL*
ranged
in
packs
through
the
primeval
forest
and
killed
their
meat
as
*NL*
they
ran
it
down
.
It
was
no
task
for
him
to
learn
to
fight
with
cut
*NL*
and
slash
and
the
quick
wolf
snap
.
In
this
manner
had
fought
forgotten
*NL*
ancestors
.
They
quickened
the
old
life
within
him
,
and
the
old
tricks
*NL*
which
they
had
stamped
into
the
heredity
of
the
breed
were
his
tricks
.
*NL*
They
came
to
him
without
effort
or
discovery
,
as
though
they
had
been
*NL*
his
always
.
And
when
,
on
the
still
cold
nights
,
he
pointed
his
nose
at
a
*NL*
star
and
howled
long
and
wolflike
,
it
was
his
ancestors
,
dead
and
dust
,
*NL*
pointing
nose
at
star
and
howling
down
through
the
centuries
and
through
*NL*
him
.
And
his
cadences
were
their
cadences
,
the
cadences
which
voiced
*NL*
their
woe
and
what
to
them
was
the
meaning
of
the
stiffness
,
and
the
*NL*
cold
,
and
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
as
token
of
what
a
puppet
thing
life
is
,
the
ancient
song
surged
*NL*
through
him
and
he
came
into
his
own
again
;
and
he
came
because
men
had
*NL*
found
a
yellow
metal
in
the
North
,
and
because
Manuel
was
a
gardener
's
*NL*
helper
whose
wages
did
not
lap
over
the
needs
of
his
wife
and
divers
*NL*
small
copies
of
himself
.

Chapter
III
.
The
Dominant
Primordial
Beast
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
dominant
primordial
beast
was
strong
in
Buck
,
and
under
the
fierce
*NL*
conditions
of
trail
life
it
grew
and
grew
.
Yet
it
was
a
secret
growth
.
*NL*
His
newborn
cunning
gave
him
poise
and
control
.
He
was
too
busy
*NL*
adjusting
himself
to
the
new
life
to
feel
at
ease
,
and
not
only
did
*NL*
he
not
pick
fights
,
but
he
avoided
them
whenever
possible
.
A
certain
*NL*
deliberateness
characterized
his
attitude
.
He
was
not
prone
to
rashness
*NL*
and
precipitate
action
;
and
in
the
bitter
hatred
between
him
and
Spitz
*NL*
he
betrayed
no
impatience
,
shunned
all
offensive
acts
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
possibly
because
he
divined
in
Buck
a
dangerous
*NL*
rival
,
Spitz
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
teeth
.
He
even
*NL*
went
out
of
his
way
to
bully
Buck
,
striving
constantly
to
start
the
*NL*
fight
which
could
end
only
in
the
death
of
one
or
the
other
.
Early
in
*NL*
the
trip
this
might
have
taken
place
had
it
not
been
for
an
unwonted
*NL*
accident
.
At
the
end
of
this
day
they
made
a
bleak
and
miserable
camp
*NL*
on
the
shore
of
Lake
Le
Barge
.
Driving
snow
,
a
wind
that
cut
like
a
*NL*
white-hot
knife
,
and
darkness
had
forced
them
to
grope
for
a
camping
*NL*
place
.
They
could
hardly
have
fared
worse
.
At
their
backs
rose
a
*NL*
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
,
and
Perrault
and
Francois
were
compelled
to
*NL*
make
their
fire
and
spread
their
sleeping
robes
on
the
ice
of
the
lake
*NL*
itself
.
The
tent
they
had
discarded
at
Dyea
in
order
to
travel
light
.
*NL*
A
few
sticks
of
driftwood
furnished
them
with
a
fire
that
thawed
down
*NL*
through
the
ice
and
left
them
to
eat
supper
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Close
in
under
the
sheltering
rock
Buck
made
his
nest
.
So
snug
and
warm
*NL*
was
it
,
that
he
was
loath
to
leave
it
when
Francois
distributed
the
*NL*
fish
which
he
had
first
thawed
over
the
fire
.
But
when
Buck
finished
his
*NL*
ration
and
returned
,
he
found
his
nest
occupied
.
A
warning
snarl
told
*NL*
him
that
the
trespasser
was
Spitz
.
Till
now
Buck
had
avoided
trouble
*NL*
with
his
enemy
,
but
this
was
too
much
.
The
beast
in
him
roared
.
He
*NL*
sprang
upon
Spitz
with
a
fury
which
surprised
them
both
,
and
Spitz
*NL*
particularly
,
for
his
whole
experience
with
Buck
had
gone
to
teach
him
*NL*
that
his
rival
was
an
unusually
timid
dog
,
who
managed
to
hold
his
own
*NL*
only
because
of
his
great
weight
and
size
.
*NL*
*NL*
Francois
was
surprised
,
too
,
when
they
shot
out
in
a
tangle
from
the
*NL*
disrupted
nest
and
he
divined
the
cause
of
the
trouble
.
``
A-a-ah
!
''
*NL*
he
cried
to
Buck
.
``
Gif
it
to
heem
,
by
Gar
!
Gif
it
to
heem
,
the
dirty
*NL*
t
`
eef
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Spitz
was
equally
willing
.
He
was
crying
with
sheer
rage
and
eagerness
*NL*
as
he
circled
back
and
forth
for
a
chance
to
spring
in
.
Buck
was
no
less
*NL*
eager
,
and
no
less
cautious
,
as
he
likewise
circled
back
and
forth
for
*NL*
the
advantage
.
But
it
was
then
that
the
unexpected
happened
,
the
thing
*NL*
which
projected
their
struggle
for
supremacy
far
into
the
future
,
past
*NL*
many
a
weary
mile
of
trail
and
toil
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
oath
from
Perrault
,
the
resounding
impact
of
a
club
upon
a
bony
*NL*
frame
,
and
a
shrill
yelp
of
pain
,
heralded
the
breaking
forth
of
*NL*
pandemonium
.
The
camp
was
suddenly
discovered
to
be
alive
with
skulking
*NL*
furry
forms
,
--
starving
huskies
,
four
or
five
score
of
them
,
who
had
*NL*
scented
the
camp
from
some
Indian
village
.
They
had
crept
in
while
Buck
*NL*
and
Spitz
were
fighting
,
and
when
the
two
men
sprang
among
them
with
*NL*
stout
clubs
they
showed
their
teeth
and
fought
back
.
They
were
crazed
*NL*
by
the
smell
of
the
food
.
Perrault
found
one
with
head
buried
in
the
*NL*
grub-box
.
His
club
landed
heavily
on
the
gaunt
ribs
,
and
the
grub-box
*NL*
was
capsized
on
the
ground
.
On
the
instant
a
score
of
the
famished
*NL*
brutes
were
scrambling
for
the
bread
and
bacon
.
The
clubs
fell
upon
them
*NL*
unheeded
.
They
yelped
and
howled
under
the
rain
of
blows
,
but
struggled
*NL*
none
the
less
madly
till
the
last
crumb
had
been
devoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
astonished
team-dogs
had
burst
out
of
their
nests
*NL*
only
to
be
set
upon
by
the
fierce
invaders
.
Never
had
Buck
seen
such
*NL*
dogs
.
It
seemed
as
though
their
bones
would
burst
through
their
skins
.
*NL*
They
were
mere
skeletons
,
draped
loosely
in
draggled
hides
,
with
blazing
*NL*
eyes
and
slavered
fangs
.
But
the
hunger-madness
made
them
terrifying
,
*NL*
irresistible
.
There
was
no
opposing
them
.
The
team-dogs
were
swept
back
*NL*
against
the
cliff
at
the
first
onset
.
Buck
was
beset
by
three
huskies
,
*NL*
and
in
a
trice
his
head
and
shoulders
were
ripped
and
slashed
.
The
din
*NL*
was
frightful
.
Billee
was
crying
as
usual
.
Dave
and
Sol-leks
,
dripping
*NL*
blood
from
a
score
of
wounds
,
were
fighting
bravely
side
by
side
.
Joe
*NL*
was
snapping
like
a
demon
.
Once
,
his
teeth
closed
on
the
fore
leg
of
*NL*
a
husky
,
and
he
crunched
down
through
the
bone
.
Pike
,
the
malingerer
,
*NL*
leaped
upon
the
crippled
animal
,
breaking
its
neck
with
a
quick
flash
of
*NL*
teeth
and
a
jerk
,
Buck
got
a
frothing
adversary
by
the
throat
,
and
was
*NL*
sprayed
with
blood
when
his
teeth
sank
through
the
jugular
.
The
warm
*NL*
taste
of
it
in
his
mouth
goaded
him
to
greater
fierceness
.
He
flung
*NL*
himself
upon
another
,
and
at
the
same
time
felt
teeth
sink
into
his
own
*NL*
throat
.
It
was
Spitz
,
treacherously
attacking
from
the
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perrault
and
Francois
,
having
cleaned
out
their
part
of
the
camp
,
*NL*
hurried
to
save
their
sled-dogs
.
The
wild
wave
of
famished
beasts
rolled
*NL*
back
before
them
,
and
Buck
shook
himself
free
.
But
it
was
only
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
The
two
men
were
compelled
to
run
back
to
save
the
grub
,
upon
*NL*
which
the
huskies
returned
to
the
attack
on
the
team
.
Billee
,
terrified
*NL*
into
bravery
,
sprang
through
the
savage
circle
and
fled
away
over
the
*NL*
ice
.
Pike
and
Dub
followed
on
his
heels
,
with
the
rest
of
the
team
*NL*
behind
.
As
Buck
drew
himself
together
to
spring
after
them
,
out
of
the
*NL*
tail
of
his
eye
he
saw
Spitz
rush
upon
him
with
the
evident
intention
*NL*
of
overthrowing
him
.
Once
off
his
feet
and
under
that
mass
of
huskies
,
*NL*
there
was
no
hope
for
him
.
But
he
braced
himself
to
the
shock
of
Spitz
's
*NL*
charge
,
then
joined
the
flight
out
on
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
the
nine
team-dogs
gathered
together
and
sought
shelter
in
the
*NL*
forest
.
Though
unpursued
,
they
were
in
a
sorry
plight
.
There
was
not
*NL*
one
who
was
not
wounded
in
four
or
five
places
,
while
some
were
wounded
*NL*
grievously
.
Dub
was
badly
injured
in
a
hind
leg
;
Dolly
,
the
last
husky
*NL*
added
to
the
team
at
Dyea
,
had
a
badly
torn
throat
;
Joe
had
lost
an
eye
;
*NL*
while
Billee
,
the
good-natured
,
with
an
ear
chewed
and
rent
to
ribbons
,
*NL*
cried
and
whimpered
throughout
the
night
.
At
daybreak
they
limped
warily
*NL*
back
to
camp
,
to
find
the
marauders
gone
and
the
two
men
in
bad
tempers
.
*NL*
Fully
half
their
grub
supply
was
gone
.
The
huskies
had
chewed
through
*NL*
the
sled
lashings
and
canvas
coverings
.
In
fact
,
nothing
,
no
matter
how
*NL*
remotely
eatable
,
had
escaped
them
.
They
had
eaten
a
pair
of
Perrault
's
*NL*
moose-hide
moccasins
,
chunks
out
of
the
leather
traces
,
and
even
two
*NL*
feet
of
lash
from
the
end
of
Francois
's
whip
.
He
broke
from
a
mournful
*NL*
contemplation
of
it
to
look
over
his
wounded
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
frien
's
,
''
he
said
softly
,
``
mebbe
it
mek
you
mad
dog
,
dose
many
*NL*
bites
.
Mebbe
all
mad
dog
,
sacredam
!
Wot
you
t
`
ink
,
eh
,
Perrault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
courier
shook
his
head
dubiously
.
With
four
hundred
miles
of
trail
*NL*
still
between
him
and
Dawson
,
he
could
ill
afford
to
have
madness
break
*NL*
out
among
his
dogs
.
Two
hours
of
cursing
and
exertion
got
the
harnesses
*NL*
into
shape
,
and
the
wound-stiffened
team
was
under
way
,
struggling
*NL*
painfully
over
the
hardest
part
of
the
trail
they
had
yet
encountered
,
*NL*
and
for
that
matter
,
the
hardest
between
them
and
Dawson
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thirty
Mile
River
was
wide
open
.
Its
wild
water
defied
the
frost
,
*NL*
and
it
was
in
the
eddies
only
and
in
the
quiet
places
that
the
ice
held
*NL*
at
all
.
Six
days
of
exhausting
toil
were
required
to
cover
those
thirty
*NL*
terrible
miles
.
And
terrible
they
were
,
for
every
foot
of
them
was
*NL*
accomplished
at
the
risk
of
life
to
dog
and
man
.
A
dozen
times
,
*NL*
Perrault
,
nosing
the
way
broke
through
the
ice
bridges
,
being
saved
by
*NL*
the
long
pole
he
carried
,
which
he
so
held
that
it
fell
each
time
across
*NL*
the
hole
made
by
his
body
.
But
a
cold
snap
was
on
,
the
thermometer
*NL*
registering
fifty
below
zero
,
and
each
time
he
broke
through
he
was
*NL*
compelled
for
very
life
to
build
a
fire
and
dry
his
garments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
daunted
him
.
It
was
because
nothing
daunted
him
that
he
had
been
*NL*
chosen
for
government
courier
.
He
took
all
manner
of
risks
,
resolutely
*NL*
thrusting
his
little
weazened
face
into
the
frost
and
struggling
on
from
*NL*
dim
dawn
to
dark
.
He
skirted
the
frowning
shores
on
rim
ice
that
bent
*NL*
and
crackled
under
foot
and
upon
which
they
dared
not
halt
.
Once
,
the
*NL*
sled
broke
through
,
with
Dave
and
Buck
,
and
they
were
half-frozen
and
*NL*
all
but
drowned
by
the
time
they
were
dragged
out
.
The
usual
fire
was
*NL*
necessary
to
save
them
.
They
were
coated
solidly
with
ice
,
and
the
two
*NL*
men
kept
them
on
the
run
around
the
fire
,
sweating
and
thawing
,
so
close
*NL*
that
they
were
singed
by
the
flames
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
Spitz
went
through
,
dragging
the
whole
team
after
him
up
*NL*
to
Buck
,
who
strained
backward
with
all
his
strength
,
his
fore
paws
on
*NL*
the
slippery
edge
and
the
ice
quivering
and
snapping
all
around
.
But
*NL*
behind
him
was
Dave
,
likewise
straining
backward
,
and
behind
the
sled
*NL*
was
Francois
,
pulling
till
his
tendons
cracked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
the
rim
ice
broke
away
before
and
behind
,
and
there
was
no
escape
*NL*
except
up
the
cliff
.
Perrault
scaled
it
by
a
miracle
,
while
Francois
*NL*
prayed
for
just
that
miracle
;
and
with
every
thong
and
sled
lashing
and
*NL*
the
last
bit
of
harness
rove
into
a
long
rope
,
the
dogs
were
hoisted
,
*NL*
one
by
one
,
to
the
cliff
crest
.
Francois
came
up
last
,
after
the
sled
*NL*
and
load
.
Then
came
the
search
for
a
place
to
descend
,
which
descent
was
*NL*
ultimately
made
by
the
aid
of
the
rope
,
and
night
found
them
back
on
the
*NL*
river
with
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
day
's
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
they
made
the
Hootalinqua
and
good
ice
,
Buck
was
played
out
.
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
dogs
were
in
like
condition
;
but
Perrault
,
to
make
*NL*
up
lost
time
,
pushed
them
late
and
early
.
The
first
day
they
covered
*NL*
thirty-five
miles
to
the
Big
Salmon
;
the
next
day
thirty-five
more
to
*NL*
the
Little
Salmon
;
the
third
day
forty
miles
,
which
brought
them
well
up
*NL*
toward
the
Five
Fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
's
feet
were
not
so
compact
and
hard
as
the
feet
of
the
huskies
.
*NL*
His
had
softened
during
the
many
generations
since
the
day
his
last
*NL*
wild
ancestor
was
tamed
by
a
cave-dweller
or
river
man
.
All
day
long
he
*NL*
limped
in
agony
,
and
camp
once
made
,
lay
down
like
a
dead
dog
.
Hungry
as
*NL*
he
was
,
he
would
not
move
to
receive
his
ration
of
fish
,
which
Francois
*NL*
had
to
bring
to
him
.
Also
,
the
dog-driver
rubbed
Buck
's
feet
for
half
*NL*
an
hour
each
night
after
supper
,
and
sacrificed
the
tops
of
his
own
*NL*
moccasins
to
make
four
moccasins
for
Buck
.
This
was
a
great
relief
,
and
*NL*
Buck
caused
even
the
weazened
face
of
Perrault
to
twist
itself
into
a
*NL*
grin
one
morning
,
when
Francois
forgot
the
moccasins
and
Buck
lay
on
his
*NL*
back
,
his
four
feet
waving
appealingly
in
the
air
,
and
refused
to
budge
*NL*
without
them
.
Later
his
feet
grew
hard
to
the
trail
,
and
the
worn-out
*NL*
foot-gear
was
thrown
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Pelly
one
morning
,
as
they
were
harnessing
up
,
Dolly
,
who
had
*NL*
never
been
conspicuous
for
anything
,
went
suddenly
mad
.
She
announced
*NL*
her
condition
by
a
long
,
heartbreaking
wolf
howl
that
sent
every
dog
*NL*
bristling
with
fear
,
then
sprang
straight
for
Buck
.
He
had
never
seen
a
*NL*
dog
go
mad
,
nor
did
he
have
any
reason
to
fear
madness
;
yet
he
knew
*NL*
that
here
was
horror
,
and
fled
away
from
it
in
a
panic
.
Straight
away
he
*NL*
raced
,
with
Dolly
,
panting
and
frothing
,
one
leap
behind
;
nor
could
she
*NL*
gain
on
him
,
so
great
was
his
terror
,
nor
could
he
leave
her
,
so
great
*NL*
was
her
madness
.
He
plunged
through
the
wooded
breast
of
the
island
,
*NL*
flew
down
to
the
lower
end
,
crossed
a
back
channel
filled
with
rough
ice
*NL*
to
another
island
,
gained
a
third
island
,
curved
back
to
the
main
river
,
*NL*
and
in
desperation
started
to
cross
it
.
And
all
the
time
,
though
he
*NL*
did
not
look
,
he
could
hear
her
snarling
just
one
leap
behind
.
Francois
*NL*
called
to
him
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
he
doubled
back
,
still
one
*NL*
leap
ahead
,
gasping
painfully
for
air
and
putting
all
his
faith
in
that
*NL*
Francois
would
save
him
.
The
dog-driver
held
the
axe
poised
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
as
Buck
shot
past
him
the
axe
crashed
down
upon
mad
Dolly
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
staggered
over
against
the
sled
,
exhausted
,
sobbing
for
breath
,
*NL*
helpless
.
This
was
Spitz
's
opportunity
.
He
sprang
upon
Buck
,
and
twice
*NL*
his
teeth
sank
into
his
unresisting
foe
and
ripped
and
tore
the
flesh
to
*NL*
the
bone
.
Then
Francois
's
lash
descended
,
and
Buck
had
the
satisfaction
*NL*
of
watching
Spitz
receive
the
worst
whipping
as
yet
administered
to
any
*NL*
of
the
teams
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
devil
,
dat
Spitz
,
''
remarked
Perrault
.
``
Some
dam
day
heem
keel

*NL*

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dat
Buck

devils
,
''
was
Francois
's
rejoinder
.
``
All

Sure
.
I
*NL*

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
then
on
it
was
war
between
them
.
Spitz
,
as
lead-dog
and
*NL*
acknowledged
master
of
the
team
,
felt
his
supremacy
threatened
by
this
*NL*
strange
Southland
dog
.
And
strange
Buck
was
to
him
,
for
of
the
many
*NL*
Southland
dogs
he
had
known
,
not
one
had
shown
up
worthily
in
camp
and
*NL*
on
trail
.
They
were
all
too
soft
,
dying
under
the
toil
,
the
frost
,
and
*NL*
starvation
.
Buck
was
the
exception
.
He
alone
endured
and
prospered
,
*NL*
matching
the
husky
in
strength
,
savagery
,
and
cunning
.
Then
he
was
a
*NL*
masterful
dog
,
and
what
made
him
dangerous
was
the
fact
that
the
club
of
*NL*
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
had
knocked
all
blind
pluck
and
rashness
out
*NL*
of
his
desire
for
mastery
.
He
was
preeminently
cunning
,
and
could
bide
*NL*
his
time
with
a
patience
that
was
nothing
less
than
primitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
inevitable
that
the
clash
for
leadership
should
come
.
Buck
wanted
*NL*
it
.
He
wanted
it
because
it
was
his
nature
,
because
he
had
been
*NL*
gripped
tight
by
that
nameless
,
incomprehensible
pride
of
the
trail
and
*NL*
trace
--
that
pride
which
holds
dogs
in
the
toil
to
the
last
gasp
,
which
*NL*
lures
them
to
die
joyfully
in
the
harness
,
and
breaks
their
hearts
*NL*
if
they
are
cut
out
of
the
harness
.
This
was
the
pride
of
Dave
as
*NL*
wheel-dog
,
of
Sol-leks
as
he
pulled
with
all
his
strength
;
the
pride
*NL*
that
laid
hold
of
them
at
break
of
camp
,
transforming
them
from
sour
and
*NL*
sullen
brutes
into
straining
,
eager
,
ambitious
creatures
;
the
pride
*NL*
that
spurred
them
on
all
day
and
dropped
them
at
pitch
of
camp
at
night
,
*NL*
letting
them
fall
back
into
gloomy
unrest
and
uncontent
.
This
was
the
*NL*
pride
that
bore
up
Spitz
and
made
him
thrash
the
sled-dogs
who
blundered
*NL*
and
shirked
in
the
traces
or
hid
away
at
harness-up
time
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Likewise
it
was
this
pride
that
made
him
fear
Buck
as
a
possible
*NL*
lead-dog
.
And
this
was
Buck
's
pride
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
openly
threatened
the
other
's
leadership
.
He
came
between
him
and
the
*NL*
shirks
he
should
have
punished
.
And
he
did
it
deliberately
.
One
night
*NL*
there
was
a
heavy
snowfall
,
and
in
the
morning
Pike
,
the
malingerer
,
*NL*
did
not
appear
.
He
was
securely
hidden
in
his
nest
under
a
foot
of
snow
.
*NL*
Francois
called
him
and
sought
him
in
vain
.
Spitz
was
wild
with
wrath
.
*NL*
He
raged
through
the
camp
,
smelling
and
digging
in
every
likely
*NL*
place
,
snarling
so
frightfully
that
Pike
heard
and
shivered
in
his
*NL*
hiding-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
was
at
last
unearthed
,
and
Spitz
flew
at
him
to
punish
him
,
*NL*
Buck
flew
,
with
equal
rage
,
in
between
.
So
unexpected
was
it
,
and
so
*NL*
shrewdly
managed
,
that
Spitz
was
hurled
backward
and
off
his
feet
.
Pike
,
*NL*
who
had
been
trembling
abjectly
,
took
heart
at
this
open
mutiny
,
*NL*
and
sprang
upon
his
overthrown
leader
.
Buck
,
to
whom
fair
play
was
a
*NL*
forgotten
code
,
likewise
sprang
upon
Spitz
.
But
Francois
,
chuckling
at
*NL*
the
incident
while
unswerving
in
the
administration
of
justice
,
brought
*NL*
his
lash
down
upon
Buck
with
all
his
might
.
This
failed
to
drive
Buck
*NL*
from
his
prostrate
rival
,
and
the
butt
of
the
whip
was
brought
into
*NL*
play
.
Half-stunned
by
the
blow
,
Buck
was
knocked
backward
and
the
lash
*NL*
laid
upon
him
again
and
again
,
while
Spitz
soundly
punished
the
many
*NL*
times
offending
Pike
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
days
that
followed
,
as
Dawson
grew
closer
and
closer
,
Buck
still
*NL*
continued
to
interfere
between
Spitz
and
the
culprits
;
but
he
did
it
*NL*
craftily
,
when
Francois
was
not
around
,
With
the
covert
mutiny
of
Buck
,
*NL*
a
general
insubordination
sprang
up
and
increased
.
Dave
and
Sol-leks
*NL*
were
unaffected
,
but
the
rest
of
the
team
went
from
bad
to
worse
.
*NL*
Things
no
longer
went
right
.
There
was
continual
bickering
and
jangling
.
*NL*
Trouble
was
always
afoot
,
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
Buck
.
He
kept
*NL*
Francois
busy
,
for
the
dog-driver
was
in
constant
apprehension
of
the
*NL*
life-and-death
struggle
between
the
two
which
he
knew
must
take
place
*NL*
sooner
or
later
;
and
on
more
than
one
night
the
sounds
of
quarrelling
*NL*
and
strife
among
the
other
dogs
turned
him
out
of
his
sleeping
robe
,
*NL*
fearful
that
Buck
and
Spitz
were
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
opportunity
did
not
present
itself
,
and
they
pulled
into
Dawson
*NL*
one
dreary
afternoon
with
the
great
fight
still
to
come
.
Here
were
many
*NL*
men
,
and
countless
dogs
,
and
Buck
found
them
all
at
work
.
It
seemed
the
*NL*
ordained
order
of
things
that
dogs
should
work
.
All
day
they
swung
up
*NL*
and
down
the
main
street
in
long
teams
,
and
in
the
night
their
jingling
*NL*
bells
still
went
by
.
They
hauled
cabin
logs
and
firewood
,
freighted
up
*NL*
to
the
mines
,
and
did
all
manner
of
work
that
horses
did
in
the
Santa
*NL*
Clara
Valley
.
Here
and
there
Buck
met
Southland
dogs
,
but
in
the
main
*NL*
they
were
the
wild
wolf
husky
breed
.
Every
night
,
regularly
,
at
nine
,
at
*NL*
twelve
,
at
three
,
they
lifted
a
nocturnal
song
,
a
weird
and
eerie
chant
,
*NL*
in
which
it
was
Buck
's
delight
to
join
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
aurora
borealis
flaming
coldly
overhead
,
or
the
stars
leaping
*NL*
in
the
frost
dance
,
and
the
land
numb
and
frozen
under
its
pall
of
snow
,
*NL*
this
song
of
the
huskies
might
have
been
the
defiance
of
life
,
only
it
*NL*
was
pitched
in
minor
key
,
with
long-drawn
wailings
and
half-sobs
,
and
*NL*
was
more
the
pleading
of
life
,
the
articulate
travail
of
existence
.
It
*NL*
was
an
old
song
,
old
as
the
breed
itself
--
one
of
the
first
songs
of
the
*NL*
younger
world
in
a
day
when
songs
were
sad
.
It
was
invested
with
the
woe
*NL*
of
unnumbered
generations
,
this
plaint
by
which
Buck
was
so
strangely
*NL*
stirred
.
When
he
moaned
and
sobbed
,
it
was
with
the
pain
of
living
that
*NL*
was
of
old
the
pain
of
his
wild
fathers
,
and
the
fear
and
mystery
of
the
*NL*
cold
and
dark
that
was
to
them
fear
and
mystery
.
And
that
he
should
be
*NL*
stirred
by
it
marked
the
completeness
with
which
he
harked
back
through
*NL*
the
ages
of
fire
and
roof
to
the
raw
beginnings
of
life
in
the
howling
*NL*
ages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
days
from
the
time
they
pulled
into
Dawson
,
they
dropped
down
the
*NL*
steep
bank
by
the
Barracks
to
the
Yukon
Trail
,
and
pulled
for
Dyea
and
*NL*
Salt
Water
.
Perrault
was
carrying
despatches
if
anything
more
urgent
*NL*
than
those
he
had
brought
in
;
also
,
the
travel
pride
had
gripped
him
,
*NL*
and
he
purposed
to
make
the
record
trip
of
the
year
.
Several
things
*NL*
favored
him
in
this
.
The
week
's
rest
had
recuperated
the
dogs
and
put
*NL*
them
in
thorough
trim
.
The
trail
they
had
broken
into
the
country
was
*NL*
packed
hard
by
later
journeyers
.
And
further
,
the
police
had
arranged
*NL*
in
two
or
three
places
deposits
of
grub
for
dog
and
man
,
and
he
was
*NL*
travelling
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
Sixty
Mile
,
which
is
a
fifty-mile
run
,
on
the
first
day
;
and
*NL*
the
second
day
saw
them
booming
up
the
Yukon
well
on
their
way
to
Pelly
.
*NL*
But
such
splendid
running
was
achieved
not
without
great
trouble
and
*NL*
vexation
on
the
part
of
Francois
.
The
insidious
revolt
led
by
Buck
*NL*
had
destroyed
the
solidarity
of
the
team
.
It
no
longer
was
as
one
dog
*NL*
leaping
in
the
traces
.
The
encouragement
Buck
gave
the
rebels
led
them
*NL*
into
all
kinds
of
petty
misdemeanors
.
No
more
was
Spitz
a
leader
greatly
*NL*
to
be
feared
.
The
old
awe
departed
,
and
they
grew
equal
to
challenging
*NL*
his
authority
.
Pike
robbed
him
of
half
a
fish
one
night
,
and
gulped
*NL*
it
down
under
the
protection
of
Buck
.
Another
night
Dub
and
Joe
fought
*NL*
Spitz
and
made
him
forego
the
punishment
they
deserved
.
And
even
*NL*
Billee
,
the
good-natured
,
was
less
good-natured
,
and
whined
not
half
*NL*
so
placatingly
as
in
former
days
.
Buck
never
came
near
Spitz
without
*NL*
snarling
and
bristling
menacingly
.
In
fact
,
his
conduct
approached
that
*NL*
of
a
bully
,
and
he
was
given
to
swaggering
up
and
down
before
Spitz
's
*NL*
very
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breaking
down
of
discipline
likewise
affected
the
dogs
in
their
*NL*
relations
with
one
another
.
They
quarrelled
and
bickered
more
than
ever
*NL*
among
themselves
,
till
at
times
the
camp
was
a
howling
bedlam
.
Dave
and
*NL*
Sol-leks
alone
were
unaltered
,
though
they
were
made
irritable
by
the
*NL*
unending
squabbling
.
Francois
swore
strange
barbarous
oaths
,
and
stamped
*NL*
the
snow
in
futile
rage
,
and
tore
his
hair
.
His
lash
was
always
singing
*NL*
among
the
dogs
,
but
it
was
of
small
avail
.
Directly
his
back
was
turned
*NL*
they
were
at
it
again
.
He
backed
up
Spitz
with
his
whip
,
while
Buck
*NL*
backed
up
the
remainder
of
the
team
.
Francois
knew
he
was
behind
all
the
*NL*
trouble
,
and
Buck
knew
he
knew
;
but
Buck
was
too
clever
ever
again
to
be
*NL*
caught
red-handed
.
He
worked
faithfully
in
the
harness
,
for
the
toil
*NL*
had
become
a
delight
to
him
;
yet
it
was
a
greater
delight
slyly
to
*NL*
precipitate
a
fight
amongst
his
mates
and
tangle
the
traces
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
mouth
of
the
Tahkeena
,
one
night
after
supper
,
Dub
turned
up
a
*NL*
snowshoe
rabbit
,
blundered
it
,
and
missed
.
In
a
second
the
whole
team
*NL*
was
in
full
cry
.
A
hundred
yards
away
was
a
camp
of
the
Northwest
*NL*
Police
,
with
fifty
dogs
,
huskies
all
,
who
joined
the
chase
.
The
rabbit
*NL*
sped
down
the
river
,
turned
off
into
a
small
creek
,
up
the
frozen
bed
of
*NL*
which
it
held
steadily
.
It
ran
lightly
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
,
while
*NL*
the
dogs
ploughed
through
by
main
strength
.
Buck
led
the
pack
,
sixty
*NL*
strong
,
around
bend
after
bend
,
but
he
could
not
gain
.
He
lay
down
low
*NL*
to
the
race
,
whining
eagerly
,
his
splendid
body
flashing
forward
,
leap
*NL*
by
leap
,
in
the
wan
white
moonlight
.
And
leap
by
leap
,
like
some
pale
*NL*
frost
wraith
,
the
snowshoe
rabbit
flashed
on
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
stirring
of
old
instincts
which
at
stated
periods
drives
men
*NL*
out
from
the
sounding
cities
to
forest
and
plain
to
kill
things
*NL*
by
chemically
propelled
leaden
pellets
,
the
blood
lust
,
the
joy
to
*NL*
kill
--
all
this
was
Buck
's
,
only
it
was
infinitely
more
intimate
.
He
was
*NL*
ranging
at
the
head
of
the
pack
,
running
the
wild
thing
down
,
the
living
*NL*
meat
,
to
kill
with
his
own
teeth
and
wash
his
muzzle
to
the
eyes
in
warm
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
an
ecstasy
that
marks
the
summit
of
life
,
and
beyond
which
life
*NL*
can
not
rise
.
And
such
is
the
paradox
of
living
,
this
ecstasy
comes
when
*NL*
one
is
most
alive
,
and
it
comes
as
a
complete
forgetfulness
that
one
is
*NL*
alive
.
This
ecstasy
,
this
forgetfulness
of
living
,
comes
to
the
artist
,
*NL*
caught
up
and
out
of
himself
in
a
sheet
of
flame
;
it
comes
to
the
*NL*
soldier
,
war-mad
on
a
stricken
field
and
refusing
quarter
;
and
it
came
*NL*
to
Buck
,
leading
the
pack
,
sounding
the
old
wolf-cry
,
straining
after
*NL*
the
food
that
was
alive
and
that
fled
swiftly
before
him
through
the
*NL*
moonlight
.
He
was
sounding
the
deeps
of
his
nature
,
and
of
the
parts
of
*NL*
his
nature
that
were
deeper
than
he
,
going
back
into
the
womb
of
Time
.
*NL*
He
was
mastered
by
the
sheer
surging
of
life
,
the
tidal
wave
of
being
,
*NL*
the
perfect
joy
of
each
separate
muscle
,
joint
,
and
sinew
in
that
it
was
*NL*
everything
that
was
not
death
,
that
it
was
aglow
and
rampant
,
expressing
*NL*
itself
in
movement
,
flying
exultantly
under
the
stars
and
over
the
face
*NL*
of
dead
matter
that
did
not
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Spitz
,
cold
and
calculating
even
in
his
supreme
moods
,
left
the
pack
*NL*
and
cut
across
a
narrow
neck
of
land
where
the
creek
made
a
long
bend
*NL*
around
.
Buck
did
not
know
of
this
,
and
as
he
rounded
the
bend
,
the
frost
*NL*
wraith
of
a
rabbit
still
flitting
before
him
,
he
saw
another
and
larger
*NL*
frost
wraith
leap
from
the
overhanging
bank
into
the
immediate
path
of
*NL*
the
rabbit
.
It
was
Spitz
.
The
rabbit
could
not
turn
,
and
as
the
white
*NL*
teeth
broke
its
back
in
mid
air
it
shrieked
as
loudly
as
a
stricken
man
*NL*
may
shriek
.
At
sound
of
this
,
the
cry
of
Life
plunging
down
from
Life
's
*NL*
apex
in
the
grip
of
Death
,
the
fall
pack
at
Buck
's
heels
raised
a
hell
's
*NL*
chorus
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
did
not
cry
out
.
He
did
not
check
himself
,
but
drove
in
upon
Spitz
,
*NL*
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
so
hard
that
he
missed
the
throat
.
They
rolled
*NL*
over
and
over
in
the
powdery
snow
.
Spitz
gained
his
feet
almost
as
*NL*
though
he
had
not
been
overthrown
,
slashing
Buck
down
the
shoulder
and
*NL*
leaping
clear
.
Twice
his
teeth
clipped
together
,
like
the
steel
jaws
of
*NL*
a
trap
,
as
he
backed
away
for
better
footing
,
with
lean
and
lifting
lips
*NL*
that
writhed
and
snarled
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
flash
Buck
knew
it
.
The
time
had
come
.
It
was
to
the
death
.
As
*NL*
they
circled
about
,
snarling
,
ears
laid
back
,
keenly
watchful
for
the
*NL*
advantage
,
the
scene
came
to
Buck
with
a
sense
of
familiarity
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
remember
it
all
,
--
the
white
woods
,
and
earth
,
and
moonlight
,
and
the
*NL*
thrill
of
battle
.
Over
the
whiteness
and
silence
brooded
a
ghostly
calm
.
*NL*
There
was
not
the
faintest
whisper
of
air
--
nothing
moved
,
not
a
leaf
*NL*
quivered
,
the
visible
breaths
of
the
dogs
rising
slowly
and
lingering
in
*NL*
the
frosty
air
.
They
had
made
short
work
of
the
snowshoe
rabbit
,
these
*NL*
dogs
that
were
ill-tamed
wolves
;
and
they
were
now
drawn
up
in
an
*NL*
expectant
circle
.
They
,
too
,
were
silent
,
their
eyes
only
gleaming
and
*NL*
their
breaths
drifting
slowly
upward
.
To
Buck
it
was
nothing
new
or
*NL*
strange
,
this
scene
of
old
time
.
It
was
as
though
it
had
always
been
,
*NL*
the
wonted
way
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spitz
was
a
practised
fighter
.
From
Spitzbergen
through
the
Arctic
,
and
*NL*
across
Canada
and
the
Barrens
,
he
had
held
his
own
with
all
manner
of
*NL*
dogs
and
achieved
to
mastery
over
them
.
Bitter
rage
was
his
,
but
never
*NL*
blind
rage
.
In
passion
to
rend
and
destroy
,
he
never
forgot
that
his
*NL*
enemy
was
in
like
passion
to
rend
and
destroy
.
He
never
rushed
till
*NL*
he
was
prepared
to
receive
a
rush
;
never
attacked
till
he
had
first
*NL*
defended
that
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
Buck
strove
to
sink
his
teeth
in
the
neck
of
the
big
white
dog
.
*NL*
Wherever
his
fangs
struck
for
the
softer
flesh
,
they
were
countered
by
*NL*
the
fangs
of
Spitz
.
Fang
clashed
fang
,
and
lips
were
cut
and
bleeding
,
*NL*
but
Buck
could
not
penetrate
his
enemy
's
guard
.
Then
he
warmed
up
and
*NL*
enveloped
Spitz
in
a
whirlwind
of
rushes
.
Time
and
time
again
he
tried
*NL*
for
the
snow-white
throat
,
where
life
bubbled
near
to
the
surface
,
and
*NL*
each
time
and
every
time
Spitz
slashed
him
and
got
away
.
Then
Buck
took
*NL*
to
rushing
,
as
though
for
the
throat
,
when
,
suddenly
drawing
back
his
*NL*
head
and
curving
in
from
the
side
,
he
would
drive
his
shoulder
at
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
Spitz
,
as
a
ram
by
which
to
overthrow
him
.
But
instead
,
*NL*
Buck
's
shoulder
was
slashed
down
each
time
as
Spitz
leaped
lightly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spitz
was
untouched
,
while
Buck
was
streaming
with
blood
and
panting
*NL*
hard
.
The
fight
was
growing
desperate
.
And
all
the
while
the
silent
and
*NL*
wolfish
circle
waited
to
finish
off
whichever
dog
went
down
.
As
Buck
*NL*
grew
winded
,
Spitz
took
to
rushing
,
and
he
kept
him
staggering
for
*NL*
footing
.
Once
Buck
went
over
,
and
the
whole
circle
of
sixty
dogs
started
*NL*
up
;
but
he
recovered
himself
,
almost
in
mid
air
,
and
the
circle
sank
*NL*
down
again
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Buck
possessed
a
quality
that
made
for
greatness
--
imagination
.
He
*NL*
fought
by
instinct
,
but
he
could
fight
by
head
as
well
.
He
rushed
,
as
*NL*
though
attempting
the
old
shoulder
trick
,
but
at
the
last
instant
swept
*NL*
low
to
the
snow
and
in
.
His
teeth
closed
on
Spitz
's
left
fore
leg
.
There
*NL*
was
a
crunch
of
breaking
bone
,
and
the
white
dog
faced
him
on
three
*NL*
legs
.
Thrice
he
tried
to
knock
him
over
,
then
repeated
the
trick
and
*NL*
broke
the
right
fore
leg
.
Despite
the
pain
and
helplessness
,
Spitz
*NL*
struggled
madly
to
keep
up
.
He
saw
the
silent
circle
,
with
gleaming
*NL*
eyes
,
lolling
tongues
,
and
silvery
breaths
drifting
upward
,
closing
in
*NL*
upon
him
as
he
had
seen
similar
circles
close
in
upon
beaten
antagonists
*NL*
in
the
past
.
Only
this
time
he
was
the
one
who
was
beaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
hope
for
him
.
Buck
was
inexorable
.
Mercy
was
a
thing
*NL*
reserved
for
gentler
climes
.
He
manoeuvred
for
the
final
rush
.
The
*NL*
circle
had
tightened
till
he
could
feel
the
breaths
of
the
huskies
on
*NL*
his
flanks
.
He
could
see
them
,
beyond
Spitz
and
to
either
side
,
half
*NL*
crouching
for
the
spring
,
their
eyes
fixed
upon
him
.
A
pause
seemed
to
*NL*
fall
.
Every
animal
was
motionless
as
though
turned
to
stone
.
Only
Spitz
*NL*
quivered
and
bristled
as
he
staggered
back
and
forth
,
snarling
with
*NL*
horrible
menace
,
as
though
to
frighten
off
impending
death
.
Then
Buck
*NL*
sprang
in
and
out
;
but
while
he
was
in
,
shoulder
had
at
last
squarely
*NL*
met
shoulder
.
The
dark
circle
became
a
dot
on
the
moon-flooded
snow
as
*NL*
Spitz
disappeared
from
view
.
Buck
stood
and
looked
on
,
the
successful
*NL*
champion
,
the
dominant
primordial
beast
who
had
made
his
kill
and
found
*NL*
it
good
.

Who
Has
Won
to
Mastership
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
Wot
I
say
?
I
spik
true
w
`
en
I
say
dat
Buck
two
devils
.
''
This
was
*NL*
Francois
's
speech
next
morning
when
he
discovered
Spitz
missing
and
Buck
*NL*
covered
with
wounds
.
He
drew
him
to
the
fire
and
by
its
light
pointed
*NL*
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dat
Spitz
fight
lak
hell
,
''
said
Perrault
,
as
he
surveyed
the
gaping
*NL*
rips
and
cuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
dat
Buck
fight
lak
two
hells
,
''
was
Francois
's
answer
.
``
An
'
now
we
*NL*
make
good
time
.
No
more
Spitz
,
no
more
trouble
,
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Perrault
packed
the
camp
outfit
and
loaded
the
sled
,
the
*NL*
dog-driver
proceeded
to
harness
the
dogs
.
Buck
trotted
up
to
the
place
*NL*
Spitz
would
have
occupied
as
leader
;
but
Francois
,
not
noticing
him
,
*NL*
brought
Sol-leks
to
the
coveted
position
.
In
his
judgment
,
Sol-leks
was
*NL*
the
best
lead-dog
left
.
Buck
sprang
upon
Sol-leks
in
a
fury
,
driving
him
*NL*
back
and
standing
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
eh
?
''
Francois
cried
,
slapping
his
thighs
gleefully
.
``
Look
at
dat
*NL*
Buck
.
Heem
keel
dat
Spitz
,
heem
t
`
ink
to
take
de
job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
`
way
,
Chook
!
''
he
cried
,
but
Buck
refused
to
budge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
Buck
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
,
and
though
the
dog
growled
*NL*
threateningly
,
dragged
him
to
one
side
and
replaced
Sol-leks
.
The
old
*NL*
dog
did
not
like
it
,
and
showed
plainly
that
he
was
afraid
of
Buck
.
*NL*
Francois
was
obdurate
,
but
when
he
turned
his
back
Buck
again
displaced
*NL*
Sol-leks
,
who
was
not
at
all
unwilling
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Francois
was
angry
.
``
Now
,
by
Gar
,
I
feex
you
!
''
he
cried
,
coming
back
*NL*
with
a
heavy
club
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
remembered
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
,
and
retreated
slowly
;
nor
*NL*
did
he
attempt
to
charge
in
when
Sol-leks
was
once
more
brought
*NL*
forward
.
But
he
circled
just
beyond
the
range
of
the
club
,
snarling
with
*NL*
bitterness
and
rage
;
and
while
he
circled
he
watched
the
club
so
as
to
*NL*
dodge
it
if
thrown
by
Francois
,
for
he
was
become
wise
in
the
way
of
*NL*
clubs
.
The
driver
went
about
his
work
,
and
he
called
to
Buck
when
he
was
*NL*
ready
to
put
him
in
his
old
place
in
front
of
Dave
.
Buck
retreated
two
*NL*
or
three
steps
.
Francois
followed
him
up
,
whereupon
he
again
retreated
.
*NL*
After
some
time
of
this
,
Francois
threw
down
the
club
,
thinking
that
*NL*
Buck
feared
a
thrashing
.
But
Buck
was
in
open
revolt
.
He
wanted
,
not
to
*NL*
escape
a
clubbing
,
but
to
have
the
leadership
.
It
was
his
by
right
.
He
*NL*
had
earned
it
,
and
he
would
not
be
content
with
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perrault
took
a
hand
.
Between
them
they
ran
him
about
for
the
better
*NL*
part
of
an
hour
.
They
threw
clubs
at
him
.
He
dodged
.
They
cursed
him
,
*NL*
and
his
fathers
and
mothers
before
him
,
and
all
his
seed
to
come
after
*NL*
him
down
to
the
remotest
generation
,
and
every
hair
on
his
body
and
drop
*NL*
of
blood
in
his
veins
;
and
he
answered
curse
with
snarl
and
kept
out
of
*NL*
their
reach
.
He
did
not
try
to
run
away
,
but
retreated
around
and
around
*NL*
the
camp
,
advertising
plainly
that
when
his
desire
was
met
,
he
would
*NL*
come
in
and
be
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Francois
sat
down
and
scratched
his
head
.
Perrault
looked
at
his
watch
*NL*
and
swore
.
Time
was
flying
,
and
they
should
have
been
on
the
trail
an
*NL*
hour
gone
.
Francois
scratched
his
head
again
.
He
shook
it
and
grinned
*NL*
sheepishly
at
the
courier
,
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
sign
that
they
*NL*
were
beaten
.
Then
Francois
went
up
to
where
Sol-leks
stood
and
called
*NL*
to
Buck
.
Buck
laughed
,
as
dogs
laugh
,
yet
kept
his
distance
.
Francois
*NL*
unfastened
Sol-leks
's
traces
and
put
him
back
in
his
old
place
.
The
team
*NL*
stood
harnessed
to
the
sled
in
an
unbroken
line
,
ready
for
the
trail
.
*NL*
There
was
no
place
for
Buck
save
at
the
front
.
Once
more
Francois
*NL*
called
,
and
once
more
Buck
laughed
and
kept
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T'row
down
de
club
,
''
Perrault
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Francois
complied
,
whereupon
Buck
trotted
in
,
laughing
triumphantly
,
*NL*
and
swung
around
into
position
at
the
head
of
the
team
.
His
traces
were
*NL*
fastened
,
the
sled
broken
out
,
and
with
both
men
running
they
dashed
out
*NL*
on
to
the
river
trail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Highly
as
the
dog-driver
had
forevalued
Buck
,
with
his
two
devils
,
he
*NL*
found
,
while
the
day
was
yet
young
,
that
he
had
undervalued
.
At
a
bound
*NL*
Buck
took
up
the
duties
of
leadership
;
and
where
judgment
was
required
,
*NL*
and
quick
thinking
and
quick
acting
,
he
showed
himself
the
superior
even
*NL*
of
Spitz
,
of
whom
Francois
had
never
seen
an
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
in
giving
the
law
and
making
his
mates
live
up
to
it
,
that
*NL*
Buck
excelled
.
Dave
and
Sol-leks
did
not
mind
the
change
in
leadership
.
*NL*
It
was
none
of
their
business
.
Their
business
was
to
toil
,
and
toil
*NL*
mightily
,
in
the
traces
.
So
long
as
that
were
not
interfered
with
,
they
*NL*
did
not
care
what
happened
.
Billee
,
the
good-natured
,
could
lead
for
all
*NL*
they
cared
,
so
long
as
he
kept
order
.
The
rest
of
the
team
,
however
,
had
*NL*
grown
unruly
during
the
last
days
of
Spitz
,
and
their
surprise
was
great
*NL*
now
that
Buck
proceeded
to
lick
them
into
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pike
,
who
pulled
at
Buck
's
heels
,
and
who
never
put
an
ounce
more
of
his
*NL*
weight
against
the
breast-band
than
he
was
compelled
to
do
,
was
swiftly
*NL*
and
repeatedly
shaken
for
loafing
;
and
ere
the
first
day
was
done
he
was
*NL*
pulling
more
than
ever
before
in
his
life
.
The
first
night
in
camp
,
*NL*
Joe
,
the
sour
one
,
was
punished
roundly
--
a
thing
that
Spitz
had
never
*NL*
succeeded
in
doing
.
Buck
simply
smothered
him
by
virtue
of
superior
*NL*
weight
,
and
cut
him
up
till
he
ceased
snapping
and
began
to
whine
for
*NL*
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
tone
of
the
team
picked
up
immediately
.
It
recovered
its
*NL*
old-time
solidarity
,
and
once
more
the
dogs
leaped
as
one
dog
in
the
*NL*
traces
.
At
the
Rink
Rapids
two
native
huskies
,
Teek
and
Koona
,
were
*NL*
added
;
and
the
celerity
with
which
Buck
broke
them
in
took
away
*NL*
Francois
's
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevaire
such
a
dog
as
dat
Buck
!
''
he
cried
.
``
No
,
nevaire
!
Heem
worth
one
*NL*
t
`
ousan
'
dollair
,
by
Gar
!
Eh
?
Wot
you
say
,
Perrault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Perrault
nodded
.
He
was
ahead
of
the
record
then
,
and
gaining
day
*NL*
by
day
.
The
trail
was
in
excellent
condition
,
well
packed
and
hard
,
and
*NL*
there
was
no
new-fallen
snow
with
which
to
contend
.
It
was
not
too
cold
.
*NL*
The
temperature
dropped
to
fifty
below
zero
and
remained
there
the
whole
*NL*
trip
.
The
men
rode
and
ran
by
turn
,
and
the
dogs
were
kept
on
the
jump
,
*NL*
with
but
infrequent
stoppages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thirty
Mile
River
was
comparatively
coated
with
ice
,
and
they
*NL*
covered
in
one
day
going
out
what
had
taken
them
ten
days
coming
in
.
In
*NL*
one
run
they
made
a
sixty-mile
dash
from
the
foot
of
Lake
Le
Barge
to
*NL*
the
White
Horse
Rapids
.
Across
Marsh
,
Tagish
,
and
Bennett
-LRB-
seventy
miles
*NL*
of
lakes
-RRB-
,
they
flew
so
fast
that
the
man
whose
turn
it
was
to
run
*NL*
towed
behind
the
sled
at
the
end
of
a
rope
.
And
on
the
last
night
of
the
*NL*
second
week
they
topped
White
Pass
and
dropped
down
the
sea
slope
with
*NL*
the
lights
of
Skaguay
and
of
the
shipping
at
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
record
run
.
Each
day
for
fourteen
days
they
had
averaged
forty
*NL*
miles
.
For
three
days
Perrault
and
Francois
threw
chests
up
and
down
the
*NL*
main
street
of
Skaguay
and
were
deluged
with
invitations
to
drink
,
while
*NL*
the
team
was
the
constant
centre
of
a
worshipful
crowd
of
dog-busters
*NL*
and
mushers
.
Then
three
or
four
western
bad
men
aspired
to
clean
out
*NL*
the
town
,
were
riddled
like
pepper-boxes
for
their
pains
,
and
public
*NL*
interest
turned
to
other
idols
.
Next
came
official
orders
.
Francois
*NL*
called
Buck
to
him
,
threw
his
arms
around
him
,
wept
over
him
.
And
that
*NL*
was
the
last
of
Francois
and
Perrault
.
Like
other
men
,
they
passed
out
*NL*
of
Buck
's
life
for
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Scotch
half-breed
took
charge
of
him
and
his
mates
,
and
in
company
*NL*
with
a
dozen
other
dog-teams
he
started
back
over
the
weary
trail
to
*NL*
Dawson
.
It
was
no
light
running
now
,
nor
record
time
,
but
heavy
toil
*NL*
each
day
,
with
a
heavy
load
behind
;
for
this
was
the
mail
train
,
*NL*
carrying
word
from
the
world
to
the
men
who
sought
gold
under
the
shadow
*NL*
of
the
Pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
did
not
like
it
,
but
he
bore
up
well
to
the
work
,
taking
pride
in
*NL*
it
after
the
manner
of
Dave
and
Sol-leks
,
and
seeing
that
his
mates
,
*NL*
whether
they
prided
in
it
or
not
,
did
their
fair
share
.
It
was
a
*NL*
monotonous
life
,
operating
with
machine-like
regularity
.
One
day
was
*NL*
very
like
another
.
At
a
certain
time
each
morning
the
cooks
turned
out
,
*NL*
fires
were
built
,
and
breakfast
was
eaten
.
Then
,
while
some
broke
camp
,
*NL*
others
harnessed
the
dogs
,
and
they
were
under
way
an
hour
or
so
before
*NL*
the
darkness
fell
which
gave
warning
of
dawn
.
At
night
,
camp
was
made
.
*NL*
Some
pitched
the
flies
,
others
cut
firewood
and
pine
boughs
for
the
*NL*
beds
,
and
still
others
carried
water
or
ice
for
the
cooks
.
Also
,
the
*NL*
dogs
were
fed
.
To
them
,
this
was
the
one
feature
of
the
day
,
though
it
*NL*
was
good
to
loaf
around
,
after
the
fish
was
eaten
,
for
an
hour
or
so
*NL*
with
the
other
dogs
,
of
which
there
were
fivescore
and
odd
.
There
were
*NL*
fierce
fighters
among
them
,
but
three
battles
with
the
fiercest
brought
*NL*
Buck
to
mastery
,
so
that
when
he
bristled
and
showed
his
teeth
they
got
*NL*
out
of
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Best
of
all
,
perhaps
,
he
loved
to
lie
near
the
fire
,
hind
legs
crouched
*NL*
under
him
,
fore
legs
stretched
out
in
front
,
head
raised
,
and
eyes
*NL*
blinking
dreamily
at
the
flames
.
Sometimes
he
thought
of
Judge
Miller
's
*NL*
big
house
in
the
sun-kissed
Santa
Clara
Valley
,
and
of
the
cement
*NL*
swimming-tank
,
and
Ysabel
,
the
Mexican
hairless
,
and
Toots
,
the
Japanese
*NL*
pug
;
but
oftener
he
remembered
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
,
the
death
of
*NL*
Curly
,
the
great
fight
with
Spitz
,
and
the
good
things
he
had
eaten
or
*NL*
would
like
to
eat
.
He
was
not
homesick
.
The
Sunland
was
very
dim
and
*NL*
distant
,
and
such
memories
had
no
power
over
him
.
Far
more
potent
were
*NL*
the
memories
of
his
heredity
that
gave
things
he
had
never
seen
before
*NL*
a
seeming
familiarity
;
the
instincts
-LRB-
which
were
but
the
memories
of
*NL*
his
ancestors
become
habits
-RRB-
which
had
lapsed
in
later
days
,
and
still
*NL*
later
,
in
him
,
quickened
and
become
alive
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
as
he
crouched
there
,
blinking
dreamily
at
the
flames
,
it
*NL*
seemed
that
the
flames
were
of
another
fire
,
and
that
as
he
crouched
*NL*
by
this
other
fire
he
saw
another
and
different
man
from
the
half-breed
*NL*
cook
before
him
.
This
other
man
was
shorter
of
leg
and
longer
of
arm
,
*NL*
with
muscles
that
were
stringy
and
knotty
rather
than
rounded
and
*NL*
swelling
.
The
hair
of
this
man
was
long
and
matted
,
and
his
head
slanted
*NL*
back
under
it
from
the
eyes
.
He
uttered
strange
sounds
,
and
seemed
very
*NL*
much
afraid
of
the
darkness
,
into
which
he
peered
continually
,
clutching
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
which
hung
midway
between
knee
and
foot
,
a
stick
with
a
*NL*
heavy
stone
made
fast
to
the
end
.
He
was
all
but
naked
,
a
ragged
and
*NL*
fire-scorched
skin
hanging
part
way
down
his
back
,
but
on
his
body
there
*NL*
was
much
hair
.
In
some
places
,
across
the
chest
and
shoulders
and
down
*NL*
the
outside
of
the
arms
and
thighs
,
it
was
matted
into
almost
a
thick
*NL*
fur
.
He
did
not
stand
erect
,
but
with
trunk
inclined
forward
from
*NL*
the
hips
,
on
legs
that
bent
at
the
knees
.
About
his
body
there
was
*NL*
a
peculiar
springiness
,
or
resiliency
,
almost
catlike
,
and
a
quick
*NL*
alertness
as
of
one
who
lived
in
perpetual
fear
of
things
seen
and
*NL*
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
other
times
this
hairy
man
squatted
by
the
fire
with
head
between
*NL*
his
legs
and
slept
.
On
such
occasions
his
elbows
were
on
his
knees
,
his
*NL*
hands
clasped
above
his
head
as
though
to
shed
rain
by
the
hairy
arms
.
*NL*
And
beyond
that
fire
,
in
the
circling
darkness
,
Buck
could
see
many
*NL*
gleaming
coals
,
two
by
two
,
always
two
by
two
,
which
he
knew
to
be
the
*NL*
eyes
of
great
beasts
of
prey
.
And
he
could
hear
the
crashing
of
their
*NL*
bodies
through
the
undergrowth
,
and
the
noises
they
made
in
the
night
.
*NL*
And
dreaming
there
by
the
Yukon
bank
,
with
lazy
eyes
blinking
at
the
*NL*
fire
,
these
sounds
and
sights
of
another
world
would
make
the
hair
to
*NL*
rise
along
his
back
and
stand
on
end
across
his
shoulders
and
up
his
*NL*
neck
,
till
he
whimpered
low
and
suppressedly
,
or
growled
softly
,
and
the
*NL*
half-breed
cook
shouted
at
him
,
``
Hey
,
you
Buck
,
wake
up
!
''
Whereupon
the
*NL*
other
world
would
vanish
and
the
real
world
come
into
his
eyes
,
and
he
*NL*
would
get
up
and
yawn
and
stretch
as
though
he
had
been
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
hard
trip
,
with
the
mail
behind
them
,
and
the
heavy
work
wore
*NL*
them
down
.
They
were
short
of
weight
and
in
poor
condition
when
they
*NL*
made
Dawson
,
and
should
have
had
a
ten
days
'
or
a
week
's
rest
at
*NL*
least
.
But
in
two
days
'
time
they
dropped
down
the
Yukon
bank
from
the
*NL*
Barracks
,
loaded
with
letters
for
the
outside
.
The
dogs
were
tired
,
the
*NL*
drivers
grumbling
,
and
to
make
matters
worse
,
it
snowed
every
day
.
This
*NL*
meant
a
soft
trail
,
greater
friction
on
the
runners
,
and
heavier
pulling
*NL*
for
the
dogs
;
yet
the
drivers
were
fair
through
it
all
,
and
did
their
*NL*
best
for
the
animals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
night
the
dogs
were
attended
to
first
.
They
ate
before
the
drivers
*NL*
ate
,
and
no
man
sought
his
sleeping-robe
till
he
had
seen
to
the
feet
of
*NL*
the
dogs
he
drove
.
Still
,
their
strength
went
down
.
Since
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
winter
they
had
travelled
eighteen
hundred
miles
,
dragging
sleds
*NL*
the
whole
weary
distance
;
and
eighteen
hundred
miles
will
tell
upon
life
*NL*
of
the
toughest
.
Buck
stood
it
,
keeping
his
mates
up
to
their
work
and
*NL*
maintaining
discipline
,
though
he
,
too
,
was
very
tired
.
Billee
cried
and
*NL*
whimpered
regularly
in
his
sleep
each
night
.
Joe
was
sourer
than
ever
,
*NL*
and
Sol-leks
was
unapproachable
,
blind
side
or
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
Dave
who
suffered
most
of
all
.
Something
had
gone
wrong
with
*NL*
him
.
He
became
more
morose
and
irritable
,
and
when
camp
was
pitched
at
*NL*
once
made
his
nest
,
where
his
driver
fed
him
.
Once
out
of
the
harness
*NL*
and
down
,
he
did
not
get
on
his
feet
again
till
harness-up
time
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
traces
,
when
jerked
by
a
sudden
stoppage
of
*NL*
the
sled
,
or
by
straining
to
start
it
,
he
would
cry
out
with
pain
.
The
*NL*
driver
examined
him
,
but
could
find
nothing
.
All
the
drivers
became
*NL*
interested
in
his
case
.
They
talked
it
over
at
meal-time
,
and
over
their
*NL*
last
pipes
before
going
to
bed
,
and
one
night
they
held
a
consultation
.
*NL*
He
was
brought
from
his
nest
to
the
fire
and
was
pressed
and
prodded
*NL*
till
he
cried
out
many
times
.
Something
was
wrong
inside
,
but
they
could
*NL*
locate
no
broken
bones
,
could
not
make
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Cassiar
Bar
was
reached
,
he
was
so
weak
that
he
was
falling
*NL*
repeatedly
in
the
traces
.
The
Scotch
half-breed
called
a
halt
and
took
*NL*
him
out
of
the
team
,
making
the
next
dog
,
Sol-leks
,
fast
to
the
sled
.
*NL*
His
intention
was
to
rest
Dave
,
letting
him
run
free
behind
the
sled
.
*NL*
Sick
as
he
was
,
Dave
resented
being
taken
out
,
grunting
and
growling
*NL*
while
the
traces
were
unfastened
,
and
whimpering
broken-heartedly
when
*NL*
he
saw
Sol-leks
in
the
position
he
had
held
and
served
so
long
.
For
the
*NL*
pride
of
trace
and
trail
was
his
,
and
,
sick
unto
death
,
he
could
not
*NL*
bear
that
another
dog
should
do
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sled
started
,
he
floundered
in
the
soft
snow
alongside
the
*NL*
beaten
trail
,
attacking
Sol-leks
with
his
teeth
,
rushing
against
him
and
*NL*
trying
to
thrust
him
off
into
the
soft
snow
on
the
other
side
,
striving
*NL*
to
leap
inside
his
traces
and
get
between
him
and
the
sled
,
and
all
the
*NL*
while
whining
and
yelping
and
crying
with
grief
and
pain
.
The
half-breed
*NL*
tried
to
drive
him
away
with
the
whip
;
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
*NL*
stinging
lash
,
and
the
man
had
not
the
heart
to
strike
harder
.
Dave
*NL*
refused
to
run
quietly
on
the
trail
behind
the
sled
,
where
the
going
was
*NL*
easy
,
but
continued
to
flounder
alongside
in
the
soft
snow
,
where
the
*NL*
going
was
most
difficult
,
till
exhausted
.
Then
he
fell
,
and
lay
where
he
*NL*
fell
,
howling
lugubriously
as
the
long
train
of
sleds
churned
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
last
remnant
of
his
strength
he
managed
to
stagger
along
behind
*NL*
till
the
train
made
another
stop
,
when
he
floundered
past
the
sleds
to
*NL*
his
own
,
where
he
stood
alongside
Sol-leks
.
His
driver
lingered
a
moment
*NL*
to
get
a
light
for
his
pipe
from
the
man
behind
.
Then
he
returned
and
*NL*
started
his
dogs
.
They
swung
out
on
the
trail
with
remarkable
lack
of
*NL*
exertion
,
turned
their
heads
uneasily
,
and
stopped
in
surprise
.
The
*NL*
driver
was
surprised
,
too
;
the
sled
had
not
moved
.
He
called
his
*NL*
comrades
to
witness
the
sight
.
Dave
had
bitten
through
both
of
*NL*
Sol-leks
's
traces
,
and
was
standing
directly
in
front
of
the
sled
in
his
*NL*
proper
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pleaded
with
his
eyes
to
remain
there
.
The
driver
was
perplexed
.
His
*NL*
comrades
talked
of
how
a
dog
could
break
its
heart
through
being
denied
*NL*
the
work
that
killed
it
,
and
recalled
instances
they
had
known
,
where
*NL*
dogs
,
too
old
for
the
toil
,
or
injured
,
had
died
because
they
were
cut
*NL*
out
of
the
traces
.
Also
,
they
held
it
a
mercy
,
since
Dave
was
to
die
*NL*
anyway
,
that
he
should
die
in
the
traces
,
heart-easy
and
content
.
So
*NL*
he
was
harnessed
in
again
,
and
proudly
he
pulled
as
of
old
,
though
more
*NL*
than
once
he
cried
out
involuntarily
from
the
bite
of
his
inward
hurt
.
*NL*
Several
times
he
fell
down
and
was
dragged
in
the
traces
,
and
once
the
*NL*
sled
ran
upon
him
so
that
he
limped
thereafter
in
one
of
his
hind
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
held
out
till
camp
was
reached
,
when
his
driver
made
a
place
for
*NL*
him
by
the
fire
.
Morning
found
him
too
weak
to
travel
.
At
harness-up
*NL*
time
he
tried
to
crawl
to
his
driver
.
By
convulsive
efforts
he
got
on
*NL*
his
feet
,
staggered
,
and
fell
.
Then
he
wormed
his
way
forward
slowly
*NL*
toward
where
the
harnesses
were
being
put
on
his
mates
.
He
would
advance
*NL*
his
fore
legs
and
drag
up
his
body
with
a
sort
of
hitching
movement
,
*NL*
when
he
would
advance
his
fore
legs
and
hitch
ahead
again
for
a
few
more
*NL*
inches
.
His
strength
left
him
,
and
the
last
his
mates
saw
of
him
he
lay
*NL*
gasping
in
the
snow
and
yearning
toward
them
.
But
they
could
hear
him
*NL*
mournfully
howling
till
they
passed
out
of
sight
behind
a
belt
of
river
*NL*
timber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
train
was
halted
.
The
Scotch
half-breed
slowly
retraced
his
*NL*
steps
to
the
camp
they
had
left
.
The
men
ceased
talking
.
A
revolver-shot
*NL*
rang
out
.
The
man
came
back
hurriedly
.
The
whips
snapped
,
the
bells
*NL*
tinkled
merrily
,
the
sleds
churned
along
the
trail
;
but
Buck
knew
,
and
*NL*
every
dog
knew
,
what
had
taken
place
behind
the
belt
of
river
trees
.

Chapter
V
.
The
Toil
of
Trace
and
Trail
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thirty
days
from
the
time
it
left
Dawson
,
the
Salt
Water
Mail
,
with
Buck
*NL*
and
his
mates
at
the
fore
,
arrived
at
Skaguay
.
They
were
in
a
wretched
*NL*
state
,
worn
out
and
worn
down
.
Buck
's
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
*NL*
had
dwindled
to
one
hundred
and
fifteen
.
The
rest
of
his
mates
,
though
*NL*
lighter
dogs
,
had
relatively
lost
more
weight
than
he
.
Pike
,
the
*NL*
malingerer
,
who
,
in
his
lifetime
of
deceit
,
had
often
successfully
*NL*
feigned
a
hurt
leg
,
was
now
limping
in
earnest
.
Sol-leks
was
limping
,
*NL*
and
Dub
was
suffering
from
a
wrenched
shoulder-blade
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
terribly
footsore
.
No
spring
or
rebound
was
left
in
them
.
*NL*
Their
feet
fell
heavily
on
the
trail
,
jarring
their
bodies
and
doubling
*NL*
the
fatigue
of
a
day
's
travel
.
There
was
nothing
the
matter
with
them
*NL*
except
that
they
were
dead
tired
.
It
was
not
the
dead-tiredness
that
*NL*
comes
through
brief
and
excessive
effort
,
from
which
recovery
is
a
*NL*
matter
of
hours
;
but
it
was
the
dead-tiredness
that
comes
through
the
*NL*
slow
and
prolonged
strength
drainage
of
months
of
toil
.
There
was
no
*NL*
power
of
recuperation
left
,
no
reserve
strength
to
call
upon
.
It
had
*NL*
been
all
used
,
the
last
least
bit
of
it
.
Every
muscle
,
every
fibre
,
*NL*
every
cell
,
was
tired
,
dead
tired
.
And
there
was
reason
for
it
.
In
less
*NL*
than
five
months
they
had
travelled
twenty-five
hundred
miles
,
during
*NL*
the
last
eighteen
hundred
of
which
they
had
had
but
five
days
'
rest
.
*NL*
When
they
arrived
at
Skaguay
they
were
apparently
on
their
last
legs
.
*NL*
They
could
barely
keep
the
traces
taut
,
and
on
the
down
grades
just
*NL*
managed
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
sled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mush
on
,
poor
sore
feets
,
''
the
driver
encouraged
them
as
they
tottered
*NL*
down
the
main
street
of
Skaguay
.
``
Dis
is
de
las
'
.
Den
we
get
one
long
*NL*
res
'
.
Eh
?
For
sure
.
One
bully
long
res
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drivers
confidently
expected
a
long
stopover
.
Themselves
,
they
had
*NL*
covered
twelve
hundred
miles
with
two
days
'
rest
,
and
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
reason
and
common
justice
they
deserved
an
interval
of
loafing
.
But
so
*NL*
many
were
the
men
who
had
rushed
into
the
Klondike
,
and
so
many
were
the
*NL*
sweethearts
,
wives
,
and
kin
that
had
not
rushed
in
,
that
the
congested
*NL*
mail
was
taking
on
Alpine
proportions
;
also
,
there
were
official
orders
.
*NL*
Fresh
batches
of
Hudson
Bay
dogs
were
to
take
the
places
of
those
*NL*
worthless
for
the
trail
.
The
worthless
ones
were
to
be
got
rid
of
,
and
,
*NL*
since
dogs
count
for
little
against
dollars
,
they
were
to
be
sold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
passed
,
by
which
time
Buck
and
his
mates
found
how
really
*NL*
tired
and
weak
they
were
.
Then
,
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
,
two
*NL*
men
from
the
States
came
along
and
bought
them
,
harness
and
all
,
for
a
*NL*
song
.
The
men
addressed
each
other
as
``
Hal
''
and
``
Charles
.
''
Charles
was
*NL*
a
middle-aged
,
lightish-colored
man
,
with
weak
and
watery
eyes
and
a
*NL*
mustache
that
twisted
fiercely
and
vigorously
up
,
giving
the
lie
to
the
*NL*
limply
drooping
lip
it
concealed
.
Hal
was
a
youngster
of
nineteen
or
*NL*
twenty
,
with
a
big
Colt
's
revolver
and
a
hunting-knife
strapped
about
*NL*
him
on
a
belt
that
fairly
bristled
with
cartridges
.
This
belt
was
the
*NL*
most
salient
thing
about
him
.
It
advertised
his
callowness
--
a
callowness
*NL*
sheer
and
unutterable
.
Both
men
were
manifestly
out
of
place
,
and
why
*NL*
such
as
they
should
adventure
the
North
is
part
of
the
mystery
of
things
*NL*
that
passes
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
heard
the
chaffering
,
saw
the
money
pass
between
the
man
and
the
*NL*
Government
agent
,
and
knew
that
the
Scotch
half-breed
and
the
mail-train
*NL*
drivers
were
passing
out
of
his
life
on
the
heels
of
Perrault
and
*NL*
Francois
and
the
others
who
had
gone
before
.
When
driven
with
his
mates
*NL*
to
the
new
owners
'
camp
,
Buck
saw
a
slipshod
and
slovenly
affair
,
tent
*NL*
half
stretched
,
dishes
unwashed
,
everything
in
disorder
;
also
,
he
saw
a
*NL*
woman
.
``
Mercedes
''
the
men
called
her
.
She
was
Charles
's
wife
and
Hal
's
*NL*
sister
--
a
nice
family
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
watched
them
apprehensively
as
they
proceeded
to
take
down
the
tent
*NL*
and
load
the
sled
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
effort
about
their
manner
,
*NL*
but
no
businesslike
method
.
The
tent
was
rolled
into
an
awkward
bundle
*NL*
three
times
as
large
as
it
should
have
been
.
The
tin
dishes
were
packed
*NL*
away
unwashed
.
Mercedes
continually
fluttered
in
the
way
of
her
men
and
*NL*
kept
up
an
unbroken
chattering
of
remonstrance
and
advice
.
When
they
put
*NL*
a
clothes-sack
on
the
front
of
the
sled
,
she
suggested
it
should
go
on
*NL*
the
back
;
and
when
they
had
put
it
on
the
back
,
and
covered
it
over
*NL*
with
a
couple
of
other
bundles
,
she
discovered
overlooked
articles
which
*NL*
could
abide
nowhere
else
but
in
that
very
sack
,
and
they
unloaded
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
men
from
a
neighboring
tent
came
out
and
looked
on
,
grinning
and
*NL*
winking
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
a
right
smart
load
as
it
is
,
''
said
one
of
them
;
``
and
it
's
*NL*
not
me
should
tell
you
your
business
,
but
I
would
n't
tote
that
tent
*NL*
along
if
I
was
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undreamed
of
!
''
cried
Mercedes
,
throwing
up
her
hands
in
dainty
dismay
.
*NL*
``
However
in
the
world
could
I
manage
without
a
tent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
springtime
,
and
you
wo
n't
get
any
more
cold
weather
,
''
the
man
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
decidedly
,
and
Charles
and
Hal
put
the
last
odds
and
*NL*
ends
on
top
the
mountainous
load
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
it
'll
ride
?
''
one
of
the
men
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
it
?
''
Charles
demanded
rather
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
all
right
,
that
's
all
right
,
''
the
man
hastened
meekly
to
*NL*
say
.
``
I
was
just
a-wonderin
'
,
that
is
all
.
It
seemed
a
mite
top-heavy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
turned
his
back
and
drew
the
lashings
down
as
well
as
he
could
,
*NL*
which
was
not
in
the
least
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
of
course
the
dogs
can
hike
along
all
day
with
that
contraption
*NL*
behind
them
,
''
affirmed
a
second
of
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Hal
,
with
freezing
politeness
,
taking
hold
of
the
*NL*
gee-pole
with
one
hand
and
swinging
his
whip
from
the
other
.
``
Mush
!
''
he
*NL*
shouted
.
``
Mush
on
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dogs
sprang
against
the
breast-bands
,
strained
hard
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
then
relaxed
.
They
were
unable
to
move
the
sled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lazy
brutes
,
I
'll
show
them
,
''
he
cried
,
preparing
to
lash
out
at
*NL*
them
with
the
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mercedes
interfered
,
crying
,
``
Oh
,
Hal
,
you
must
n't
,
''
as
she
caught
*NL*
hold
of
the
whip
and
wrenched
it
from
him
.
``
The
poor
dears
!
Now
you
*NL*
must
promise
you
wo
n't
be
harsh
with
them
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
,
or
I
*NL*
wo
n't
go
a
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precious
lot
you
know
about
dogs
,
''
her
brother
sneered
;
``
and
I
wish
*NL*
you
'd
leave
me
alone
.
They
're
lazy
,
I
tell
you
,
and
you
've
got
to
whip
*NL*
them
to
get
anything
out
of
them
.
That
's
their
way
.
You
ask
any
one
.
Ask
*NL*
one
of
those
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
looked
at
them
imploringly
,
untold
repugnance
at
sight
of
pain
*NL*
written
in
her
pretty
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
weak
as
water
,
if
you
want
to
know
,
''
came
the
reply
from
one
*NL*
of
the
men
.
``
Plum
tuckered
out
,
that
's
what
's
the
matter
.
They
need
a
*NL*
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rest
be
blanked
,
''
said
Hal
,
with
his
beardless
lips
;
and
Mercedes
said
,
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
in
pain
and
sorrow
at
the
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
a
clannish
creature
,
and
rushed
at
once
to
the
defence
of
*NL*
her
brother
.
``
Never
mind
that
man
,
''
she
said
pointedly
.
``
You
're
driving
*NL*
our
dogs
,
and
you
do
what
you
think
best
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Hal
's
whip
fell
upon
the
dogs
.
They
threw
themselves
against
the
*NL*
breast-bands
,
dug
their
feet
into
the
packed
snow
,
got
down
low
to
it
,
*NL*
and
put
forth
all
their
strength
.
The
sled
held
as
though
it
were
an
*NL*
anchor
.
After
two
efforts
,
they
stood
still
,
panting
.
The
whip
was
*NL*
whistling
savagely
,
when
once
more
Mercedes
interfered
.
She
dropped
on
*NL*
her
knees
before
Buck
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
put
her
arms
around
*NL*
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
poor
,
poor
dears
,
''
she
cried
sympathetically
,
``
why
do
n't
you
pull
*NL*
hard
?
--
then
you
would
n't
be
whipped
.
''
Buck
did
not
like
her
,
but
he
*NL*
was
feeling
too
miserable
to
resist
her
,
taking
it
as
part
of
the
day
's
*NL*
miserable
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
onlookers
,
who
had
been
clenching
his
teeth
to
suppress
hot
*NL*
speech
,
now
spoke
up
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
I
care
a
whoop
what
becomes
of
you
,
but
for
the
dogs
'
*NL*
sakes
I
just
want
to
tell
you
,
you
can
help
them
a
mighty
lot
by
*NL*
breaking
out
that
sled
.
The
runners
are
froze
fast
.
Throw
your
weight
*NL*
against
the
gee-pole
,
right
and
left
,
and
break
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
time
the
attempt
was
made
,
but
this
time
,
following
the
advice
,
*NL*
Hal
broke
out
the
runners
which
had
been
frozen
to
the
snow
.
The
*NL*
overloaded
and
unwieldy
sled
forged
ahead
,
Buck
and
his
mates
struggling
*NL*
frantically
under
the
rain
of
blows
.
A
hundred
yards
ahead
the
path
*NL*
turned
and
sloped
steeply
into
the
main
street
.
It
would
have
required
*NL*
an
experienced
man
to
keep
the
top-heavy
sled
upright
,
and
Hal
was
not
*NL*
such
a
man
.
As
they
swung
on
the
turn
the
sled
went
over
,
spilling
*NL*
half
its
load
through
the
loose
lashings
.
The
dogs
never
stopped
.
The
*NL*
lightened
sled
bounded
on
its
side
behind
them
.
They
were
angry
because
*NL*
of
the
ill
treatment
they
had
received
and
the
unjust
load
.
Buck
was
*NL*
raging
.
He
broke
into
a
run
,
the
team
following
his
lead
.
Hal
cried
*NL*
``
Whoa
!
whoa
!
''
but
they
gave
no
heed
.
He
tripped
and
was
pulled
off
his
*NL*
feet
.
The
capsized
sled
ground
over
him
,
and
the
dogs
dashed
on
up
the
*NL*
street
,
adding
to
the
gayety
of
Skaguay
as
they
scattered
the
remainder
*NL*
of
the
outfit
along
its
chief
thoroughfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kind-hearted
citizens
caught
the
dogs
and
gathered
up
the
scattered
*NL*
belongings
.
Also
,
they
gave
advice
.
Half
the
load
and
twice
the
dogs
,
*NL*
if
they
ever
expected
to
reach
Dawson
,
was
what
was
said
.
Hal
and
*NL*
his
sister
and
brother-in-law
listened
unwillingly
,
pitched
tent
,
and
*NL*
overhauled
the
outfit
.
Canned
goods
were
turned
out
that
made
men
laugh
,
*NL*
for
canned
goods
on
the
Long
Trail
is
a
thing
to
dream
about
.
``
Blankets
*NL*
for
a
hotel
''
quoth
one
of
the
men
who
laughed
and
helped
.
``
Half
as
*NL*
many
is
too
much
;
get
rid
of
them
.
Throw
away
that
tent
,
and
all
those
*NL*
dishes
,
--
who
's
going
to
wash
them
,
anyway
?
Good
Lord
,
do
you
think
*NL*
you
're
travelling
on
a
Pullman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
went
,
the
inexorable
elimination
of
the
superfluous
.
Mercedes
*NL*
cried
when
her
clothes-bags
were
dumped
on
the
ground
and
article
*NL*
after
article
was
thrown
out
.
She
cried
in
general
,
and
she
cried
in
*NL*
particular
over
each
discarded
thing
.
She
clasped
hands
about
knees
,
*NL*
rocking
back
and
forth
broken-heartedly
.
She
averred
she
would
not
go
*NL*
an
inch
,
not
for
a
dozen
Charleses
.
She
appealed
to
everybody
and
to
*NL*
everything
,
finally
wiping
her
eyes
and
proceeding
to
cast
out
even
*NL*
articles
of
apparel
that
were
imperative
necessaries
.
And
in
her
zeal
,
*NL*
when
she
had
finished
with
her
own
,
she
attacked
the
belongings
of
her
*NL*
men
and
went
through
them
like
a
tornado
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
accomplished
,
the
outfit
,
though
cut
in
half
,
was
still
a
*NL*
formidable
bulk
.
Charles
and
Hal
went
out
in
the
evening
and
bought
six
*NL*
Outside
dogs
.
These
,
added
to
the
six
of
the
original
team
,
and
Teek
*NL*
and
Koona
,
the
huskies
obtained
at
the
Rink
Rapids
on
the
record
*NL*
trip
,
brought
the
team
up
to
fourteen
.
But
the
Outside
dogs
,
though
*NL*
practically
broken
in
since
their
landing
,
did
not
amount
to
much
.
Three
*NL*
were
short-haired
pointers
,
one
was
a
Newfoundland
,
and
the
other
*NL*
two
were
mongrels
of
indeterminate
breed
.
They
did
not
seem
to
know
*NL*
anything
,
these
newcomers
.
Buck
and
his
comrades
looked
upon
them
with
*NL*
disgust
,
and
though
he
speedily
taught
them
their
places
and
what
not
*NL*
to
do
,
he
could
not
teach
them
what
to
do
.
They
did
not
take
kindly
*NL*
to
trace
and
trail
.
With
the
exception
of
the
two
mongrels
,
they
were
*NL*
bewildered
and
spirit-broken
by
the
strange
savage
environment
in
which
*NL*
they
found
themselves
and
by
the
ill
treatment
they
had
received
.
The
*NL*
two
mongrels
were
without
spirit
at
all
;
bones
were
the
only
things
*NL*
breakable
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
newcomers
hopeless
and
forlorn
,
and
the
old
team
worn
out
by
*NL*
twenty-five
hundred
miles
of
continuous
trail
,
the
outlook
was
anything
*NL*
but
bright
.
The
two
men
,
however
,
were
quite
cheerful
.
And
they
were
*NL*
proud
,
too
.
They
were
doing
the
thing
in
style
,
with
fourteen
dogs
.
They
*NL*
had
seen
other
sleds
depart
over
the
Pass
for
Dawson
,
or
come
in
from
*NL*
Dawson
,
but
never
had
they
seen
a
sled
with
so
many
as
fourteen
dogs
.
In
*NL*
the
nature
of
Arctic
travel
there
was
a
reason
why
fourteen
dogs
should
*NL*
not
drag
one
sled
,
and
that
was
that
one
sled
could
not
carry
the
food
*NL*
for
fourteen
dogs
.
But
Charles
and
Hal
did
not
know
this
.
They
had
*NL*
worked
the
trip
out
with
a
pencil
,
so
much
to
a
dog
,
so
many
dogs
,
*NL*
so
many
days
,
Q.E.D.
Mercedes
looked
over
their
shoulders
and
nodded
*NL*
comprehensively
,
it
was
all
so
very
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
next
morning
Buck
led
the
long
team
up
the
street
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
lively
about
it
,
no
snap
or
go
in
him
and
his
fellows
.
They
were
*NL*
starting
dead
weary
.
Four
times
he
had
covered
the
distance
between
Salt
*NL*
Water
and
Dawson
,
and
the
knowledge
that
,
jaded
and
tired
,
he
was
facing
*NL*
the
same
trail
once
more
,
made
him
bitter
.
His
heart
was
not
in
*NL*
the
work
,
nor
was
the
heart
of
any
dog
.
The
Outsides
were
timid
and
*NL*
frightened
,
the
Insides
without
confidence
in
their
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
felt
vaguely
that
there
was
no
depending
upon
these
two
men
and
the
*NL*
woman
.
They
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
,
and
as
the
days
went
by
*NL*
it
became
apparent
that
they
could
not
learn
.
They
were
slack
in
all
*NL*
things
,
without
order
or
discipline
.
It
took
them
half
the
night
to
*NL*
pitch
a
slovenly
camp
,
and
half
the
morning
to
break
that
camp
and
get
*NL*
the
sled
loaded
in
fashion
so
slovenly
that
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
*NL*
were
occupied
in
stopping
and
rearranging
the
load
.
Some
days
they
did
*NL*
not
make
ten
miles
.
On
other
days
they
were
unable
to
get
started
*NL*
at
all
.
And
on
no
day
did
they
succeed
in
making
more
than
half
the
*NL*
distance
used
by
the
men
as
a
basis
in
their
dog-food
computation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
inevitable
that
they
should
go
short
on
dog-food
.
But
they
*NL*
hastened
it
by
overfeeding
,
bringing
the
day
nearer
when
underfeeding
*NL*
would
commence
.
The
Outside
dogs
,
whose
digestions
had
not
been
trained
*NL*
by
chronic
famine
to
make
the
most
of
little
,
had
voracious
appetites
.
*NL*
And
when
,
in
addition
to
this
,
the
worn-out
huskies
pulled
weakly
,
Hal
*NL*
decided
that
the
orthodox
ration
was
too
small
.
He
doubled
it
.
And
to
*NL*
cap
it
all
,
when
Mercedes
,
with
tears
in
her
pretty
eyes
and
a
quaver
*NL*
in
her
throat
,
could
not
cajole
him
into
giving
the
dogs
still
more
,
she
*NL*
stole
from
the
fish-sacks
and
fed
them
slyly
.
But
it
was
not
food
that
*NL*
Buck
and
the
huskies
needed
,
but
rest
.
And
though
they
were
making
poor
*NL*
time
,
the
heavy
load
they
dragged
sapped
their
strength
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
underfeeding
.
Hal
awoke
one
day
to
the
fact
that
his
*NL*
dog-food
was
half
gone
and
the
distance
only
quarter
covered
;
further
,
*NL*
that
for
love
or
money
no
additional
dog-food
was
to
be
obtained
.
So
*NL*
he
cut
down
even
the
orthodox
ration
and
tried
to
increase
the
day
's
*NL*
travel
.
His
sister
and
brother-in-law
seconded
him
;
but
they
were
*NL*
frustrated
by
their
heavy
outfit
and
their
own
incompetence
.
It
was
a
*NL*
simple
matter
to
give
the
dogs
less
food
;
but
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
make
the
dogs
travel
faster
,
while
their
own
inability
to
get
under
way
*NL*
earlier
in
the
morning
prevented
them
from
travelling
longer
hours
.
Not
*NL*
only
did
they
not
know
how
to
work
dogs
,
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
*NL*
work
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
go
was
Dub
.
Poor
blundering
thief
that
he
was
,
always
*NL*
getting
caught
and
punished
,
he
had
none
the
less
been
a
faithful
*NL*
worker
.
His
wrenched
shoulder-blade
,
untreated
and
unrested
,
went
from
*NL*
bad
to
worse
,
till
finally
Hal
shot
him
with
the
big
Colt
's
revolver
.
It
*NL*
is
a
saying
of
the
country
that
an
Outside
dog
starves
to
death
on
the
*NL*
ration
of
the
husky
,
so
the
six
Outside
dogs
under
Buck
could
do
no
less
*NL*
than
die
on
half
the
ration
of
the
husky
.
The
Newfoundland
went
first
,
*NL*
followed
by
the
three
short-haired
pointers
,
the
two
mongrels
hanging
*NL*
more
grittily
on
to
life
,
but
going
in
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
all
the
amenities
and
gentlenesses
of
the
Southland
had
*NL*
fallen
away
from
the
three
people
.
Shorn
of
its
glamour
and
romance
,
*NL*
Arctic
travel
became
to
them
a
reality
too
harsh
for
their
manhood
and
*NL*
womanhood
.
Mercedes
ceased
weeping
over
the
dogs
,
being
too
occupied
*NL*
with
weeping
over
herself
and
with
quarrelling
with
her
husband
and
*NL*
brother
.
To
quarrel
was
the
one
thing
they
were
never
too
weary
to
do
.
*NL*
Their
irritability
arose
out
of
their
misery
,
increased
with
it
,
doubled
*NL*
upon
it
,
outdistanced
it
.
The
wonderful
patience
of
the
trail
which
*NL*
comes
to
men
who
toil
hard
and
suffer
sore
,
and
remain
sweet
of
speech
*NL*
and
kindly
,
did
not
come
to
these
two
men
and
the
woman
.
They
had
no
*NL*
inkling
of
such
a
patience
.
They
were
stiff
and
in
pain
;
their
muscles
*NL*
ached
,
their
bones
ached
,
their
very
hearts
ached
;
and
because
of
this
*NL*
they
became
sharp
of
speech
,
and
hard
words
were
first
on
their
lips
in
*NL*
the
morning
and
last
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
Hal
wrangled
whenever
Mercedes
gave
them
a
chance
.
It
was
*NL*
the
cherished
belief
of
each
that
he
did
more
than
his
share
of
the
*NL*
work
,
and
neither
forbore
to
speak
this
belief
at
every
opportunity
.
*NL*
Sometimes
Mercedes
sided
with
her
husband
,
sometimes
with
her
brother
.
*NL*
The
result
was
a
beautiful
and
unending
family
quarrel
.
Starting
from
*NL*
a
dispute
as
to
which
should
chop
a
few
sticks
for
the
fire
-LRB-
a
dispute
*NL*
which
concerned
only
Charles
and
Hal
-RRB-
,
presently
would
be
lugged
in
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
family
,
fathers
,
mothers
,
uncles
,
cousins
,
people
thousands
*NL*
of
miles
away
,
and
some
of
them
dead
.
That
Hal
's
views
on
art
,
or
the
*NL*
sort
of
society
plays
his
mother
's
brother
wrote
,
should
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
the
chopping
of
a
few
sticks
of
firewood
,
passes
*NL*
comprehension
;
nevertheless
the
quarrel
was
as
likely
to
tend
in
that
*NL*
direction
as
in
the
direction
of
Charles
's
political
prejudices
.
And
*NL*
that
Charles
's
sister
's
tale-bearing
tongue
should
be
relevant
to
the
*NL*
building
of
a
Yukon
fire
,
was
apparent
only
to
Mercedes
,
who
disburdened
*NL*
herself
of
copious
opinions
upon
that
topic
,
and
incidentally
upon
a
*NL*
few
other
traits
unpleasantly
peculiar
to
her
husband
's
family
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
the
fire
remained
unbuilt
,
the
camp
half
pitched
,
and
the
dogs
*NL*
unfed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
nursed
a
special
grievance
--
the
grievance
of
sex
.
She
was
*NL*
pretty
and
soft
,
and
had
been
chivalrously
treated
all
her
days
.
But
*NL*
the
present
treatment
by
her
husband
and
brother
was
everything
save
*NL*
chivalrous
.
It
was
her
custom
to
be
helpless
.
They
complained
.
Upon
*NL*
which
impeachment
of
what
to
her
was
her
most
essential
sex-prerogative
,
*NL*
she
made
their
lives
unendurable
.
She
no
longer
considered
the
dogs
,
and
*NL*
because
she
was
sore
and
tired
,
she
persisted
in
riding
on
the
sled
.
She
*NL*
was
pretty
and
soft
,
but
she
weighed
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
--
a
*NL*
lusty
last
straw
to
the
load
dragged
by
the
weak
and
starving
animals
.
*NL*
She
rode
for
days
,
till
they
fell
in
the
traces
and
the
sled
stood
*NL*
still
.
Charles
and
Hal
begged
her
to
get
off
and
walk
,
pleaded
with
her
,
*NL*
entreated
,
the
while
she
wept
and
importuned
Heaven
with
a
recital
of
*NL*
their
brutality
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
occasion
they
took
her
off
the
sled
by
main
strength
.
They
never
*NL*
did
it
again
.
She
let
her
legs
go
limp
like
a
spoiled
child
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
trail
.
They
went
on
their
way
,
but
she
did
not
move
.
After
*NL*
they
had
travelled
three
miles
they
unloaded
the
sled
,
came
back
for
*NL*
her
,
and
by
main
strength
put
her
on
the
sled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
excess
of
their
own
misery
they
were
callous
to
the
suffering
of
*NL*
their
animals
.
Hal
's
theory
,
which
he
practised
on
others
,
was
that
one
*NL*
must
get
hardened
.
He
had
started
out
preaching
it
to
his
sister
and
*NL*
brother-in-law
.
Failing
there
,
he
hammered
it
into
the
dogs
with
a
club
.
*NL*
At
the
Five
Fingers
the
dog-food
gave
out
,
and
a
toothless
old
squaw
*NL*
offered
to
trade
them
a
few
pounds
of
frozen
horse-hide
for
the
Colt
's
*NL*
revolver
that
kept
the
big
hunting-knife
company
at
Hal
's
hip
.
A
poor
*NL*
substitute
for
food
was
this
hide
,
just
as
it
had
been
stripped
from
the
*NL*
starved
horses
of
the
cattlemen
six
months
back
.
In
its
frozen
state
it
*NL*
was
more
like
strips
of
galvanized
iron
,
and
when
a
dog
wrestled
it
into
*NL*
his
stomach
it
thawed
into
thin
and
innutritious
leathery
strings
and
*NL*
into
a
mass
of
short
hair
,
irritating
and
indigestible
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
through
it
all
Buck
staggered
along
at
the
head
of
the
team
as
in
*NL*
a
nightmare
.
He
pulled
when
he
could
;
when
he
could
no
longer
pull
,
he
*NL*
fell
down
and
remained
down
till
blows
from
whip
or
club
drove
him
*NL*
to
his
feet
again
.
All
the
stiffness
and
gloss
had
gone
out
of
his
*NL*
beautiful
furry
coat
.
The
hair
hung
down
,
limp
and
draggled
,
or
matted
*NL*
with
dried
blood
where
Hal
's
club
had
bruised
him
.
His
muscles
had
*NL*
wasted
away
to
knotty
strings
,
and
the
flesh
pads
had
disappeared
,
so
*NL*
that
each
rib
and
every
bone
in
his
frame
were
outlined
cleanly
*NL*
through
the
loose
hide
that
was
wrinkled
in
folds
of
emptiness
.
It
was
*NL*
heartbreaking
,
only
Buck
's
heart
was
unbreakable
.
The
man
in
the
red
*NL*
sweater
had
proved
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
was
with
Buck
,
so
was
it
with
his
mates
.
They
were
perambulating
*NL*
skeletons
.
There
were
seven
all
together
,
including
him
.
In
their
very
*NL*
great
misery
they
had
become
insensible
to
the
bite
of
the
lash
or
the
*NL*
bruise
of
the
club
.
The
pain
of
the
beating
was
dull
and
distant
,
*NL*
just
as
the
things
their
eyes
saw
and
their
ears
heard
seemed
dull
and
*NL*
distant
.
They
were
not
half
living
,
or
quarter
living
.
They
were
simply
*NL*
so
many
bags
of
bones
in
which
sparks
of
life
fluttered
faintly
.
When
a
*NL*
halt
was
made
,
they
dropped
down
in
the
traces
like
dead
dogs
,
and
the
*NL*
spark
dimmed
and
paled
and
seemed
to
go
out
.
And
when
the
club
or
whip
*NL*
fell
upon
them
,
the
spark
fluttered
feebly
up
,
and
they
tottered
to
*NL*
their
feet
and
staggered
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
day
when
Billee
,
the
good-natured
,
fell
and
could
not
rise
.
*NL*
Hal
had
traded
off
his
revolver
,
so
he
took
the
axe
and
knocked
Billee
*NL*
on
the
head
as
he
lay
in
the
traces
,
then
cut
the
carcass
out
of
the
*NL*
harness
and
dragged
it
to
one
side
.
Buck
saw
,
and
his
mates
saw
,
and
*NL*
they
knew
that
this
thing
was
very
close
to
them
.
On
the
next
day
Koona
*NL*
went
,
and
but
five
of
them
remained
:
Joe
,
too
far
gone
to
be
malignant
;
*NL*
Pike
,
crippled
and
limping
,
only
half
conscious
and
not
conscious
enough
*NL*
longer
to
malinger
;
Sol-leks
,
the
one-eyed
,
still
faithful
to
the
toil
*NL*
of
trace
and
trail
,
and
mournful
in
that
he
had
so
little
strength
with
*NL*
which
to
pull
;
Teek
,
who
had
not
travelled
so
far
that
winter
and
who
*NL*
was
now
beaten
more
than
the
others
because
he
was
fresher
;
and
Buck
,
*NL*
still
at
the
head
of
the
team
,
but
no
longer
enforcing
discipline
or
*NL*
striving
to
enforce
it
,
blind
with
weakness
half
the
time
and
keeping
*NL*
the
trail
by
the
loom
of
it
and
by
the
dim
feel
of
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
beautiful
spring
weather
,
but
neither
dogs
nor
humans
were
aware
*NL*
of
it
.
Each
day
the
sun
rose
earlier
and
set
later
.
It
was
dawn
by
three
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
twilight
lingered
till
nine
at
night
.
The
whole
long
*NL*
day
was
a
blaze
of
sunshine
.
The
ghostly
winter
silence
had
given
way
*NL*
to
the
great
spring
murmur
of
awakening
life
.
This
murmur
arose
from
all
*NL*
the
land
,
fraught
with
the
joy
of
living
.
It
came
from
the
things
that
*NL*
lived
and
moved
again
,
things
which
had
been
as
dead
and
which
had
not
*NL*
moved
during
the
long
months
of
frost
.
The
sap
was
rising
in
the
pines
.
*NL*
The
willows
and
aspens
were
bursting
out
in
young
buds
.
Shrubs
and
vines
*NL*
were
putting
on
fresh
garbs
of
green
.
Crickets
sang
in
the
nights
,
and
*NL*
in
the
days
all
manner
of
creeping
,
crawling
things
rustled
forth
into
*NL*
the
sun
.
Partridges
and
woodpeckers
were
booming
and
knocking
in
the
*NL*
forest
.
Squirrels
were
chattering
,
birds
singing
,
and
overhead
honked
*NL*
the
wild-fowl
driving
up
from
the
south
in
cunning
wedges
that
split
the
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
every
hill
slope
came
the
trickle
of
running
water
,
the
music
of
*NL*
unseen
fountains
.
All
things
were
thawing
,
bending
,
snapping
.
The
Yukon
*NL*
was
straining
to
break
loose
the
ice
that
bound
it
down
.
It
ate
away
*NL*
from
beneath
;
the
sun
ate
from
above
.
Air-holes
formed
,
fissures
sprang
*NL*
and
spread
apart
,
while
thin
sections
of
ice
fell
through
bodily
into
*NL*
the
river
.
And
amid
all
this
bursting
,
rending
,
throbbing
of
awakening
*NL*
life
,
under
the
blazing
sun
and
through
the
soft-sighing
breezes
,
like
*NL*
wayfarers
to
death
,
staggered
the
two
men
,
the
woman
,
and
the
huskies
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
dogs
falling
,
Mercedes
weeping
and
riding
,
Hal
swearing
*NL*
innocuously
,
and
Charles
's
eyes
wistfully
watering
,
they
staggered
into
*NL*
John
Thornton
's
camp
at
the
mouth
of
White
River
.
When
they
halted
,
*NL*
the
dogs
dropped
down
as
though
they
had
all
been
struck
dead
.
Mercedes
*NL*
dried
her
eyes
and
looked
at
John
Thornton
.
Charles
sat
down
on
a
log
*NL*
to
rest
.
He
sat
down
very
slowly
and
painstakingly
what
of
his
great
*NL*
stiffness
.
Hal
did
the
talking
.
John
Thornton
was
whittling
the
last
*NL*
touches
on
an
axe-handle
he
had
made
from
a
stick
of
birch
.
He
whittled
*NL*
and
listened
,
gave
monosyllabic
replies
,
and
,
when
it
was
asked
,
terse
*NL*
advice
.
He
knew
the
breed
,
and
he
gave
his
advice
in
the
certainty
that
*NL*
it
would
not
be
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
told
us
up
above
that
the
bottom
was
dropping
out
of
the
trail
and
*NL*
that
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
lay
over
,
''
Hal
said
in
response
*NL*
to
Thornton
's
warning
to
take
no
more
chances
on
the
rotten
ice
.
``
They
*NL*
told
us
we
could
n't
make
White
River
,
and
here
we
are
.
''
This
last
with
a
*NL*
sneering
ring
of
triumph
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
told
you
true
,
''
John
Thornton
answered
.
``
The
bottom
's
likely
*NL*
to
drop
out
at
any
moment
.
Only
fools
,
with
the
blind
luck
of
fools
,
*NL*
could
have
made
it
.
I
tell
you
straight
,
I
would
n't
risk
my
carcass
on
*NL*
that
ice
for
all
the
gold
in
Alaska
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
you
're
not
a
fool
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Hal
.
``
All
the
same
,
*NL*
we
'll
go
on
to
Dawson
.
''
He
uncoiled
his
whip
.
``
Get
up
there
,
Buck
!
Hi
!
*NL*
Get
up
there
!
Mush
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
went
on
whittling
.
It
was
idle
,
he
knew
,
to
get
between
a
fool
*NL*
and
his
folly
;
while
two
or
three
fools
more
or
less
would
not
alter
the
*NL*
scheme
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
team
did
not
get
up
at
the
command
.
It
had
long
since
passed
*NL*
into
the
stage
where
blows
were
required
to
rouse
it
.
The
whip
flashed
*NL*
out
,
here
and
there
,
on
its
merciless
errands
.
John
Thornton
compressed
*NL*
his
lips
.
Sol-leks
was
the
first
to
crawl
to
his
feet
.
Teek
followed
.
*NL*
Joe
came
next
,
yelping
with
pain
.
Pike
made
painful
efforts
.
Twice
he
*NL*
fell
over
,
when
half
up
,
and
on
the
third
attempt
managed
to
rise
.
Buck
*NL*
made
no
effort
.
He
lay
quietly
where
he
had
fallen
.
The
lash
bit
into
*NL*
him
again
and
again
,
but
he
neither
whined
nor
struggled
.
Several
times
*NL*
Thornton
started
,
as
though
to
speak
,
but
changed
his
mind
.
A
moisture
*NL*
came
into
his
eyes
,
and
,
as
the
whipping
continued
,
he
arose
and
walked
*NL*
irresolutely
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
Buck
had
failed
,
in
itself
a
sufficient
reason
*NL*
to
drive
Hal
into
a
rage
.
He
exchanged
the
whip
for
the
customary
club
.
*NL*
Buck
refused
to
move
under
the
rain
of
heavier
blows
which
now
fell
upon
*NL*
him
.
Like
his
mates
,
he
was
barely
able
to
get
up
,
but
,
unlike
them
,
he
*NL*
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
get
up
.
He
had
a
vague
feeling
of
impending
*NL*
doom
.
This
had
been
strong
upon
him
when
he
pulled
in
to
the
bank
,
and
*NL*
it
had
not
departed
from
him
.
What
of
the
thin
and
rotten
ice
he
had
*NL*
felt
under
his
feet
all
day
,
it
seemed
that
he
sensed
disaster
close
at
*NL*
hand
,
out
there
ahead
on
the
ice
where
his
master
was
trying
to
drive
*NL*
him
.
He
refused
to
stir
.
So
greatly
had
he
suffered
,
and
so
far
gone
was
*NL*
he
,
that
the
blows
did
not
hurt
much
.
And
as
they
continued
to
fall
upon
*NL*
him
,
the
spark
of
life
within
flickered
and
went
down
.
It
was
nearly
*NL*
out
.
He
felt
strangely
numb
.
As
though
from
a
great
distance
,
he
was
*NL*
aware
that
he
was
being
beaten
.
The
last
sensations
of
pain
left
him
.
He
*NL*
no
longer
felt
anything
,
though
very
faintly
he
could
hear
the
impact
of
*NL*
the
club
upon
his
body
.
But
it
was
no
longer
his
body
,
it
seemed
so
far
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
suddenly
,
without
warning
,
uttering
a
cry
that
was
*NL*
inarticulate
and
more
like
the
cry
of
an
animal
,
John
Thornton
sprang
*NL*
upon
the
man
who
wielded
the
club
.
Hal
was
hurled
backward
,
as
*NL*
though
struck
by
a
falling
tree
.
Mercedes
screamed
.
Charles
looked
on
*NL*
wistfully
,
wiped
his
watery
eyes
,
but
did
not
get
up
because
of
his
*NL*
stiffness
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thornton
stood
over
Buck
,
struggling
to
control
himself
,
too
*NL*
convulsed
with
rage
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
strike
that
dog
again
,
I
'll
kill
you
,
''
he
at
last
managed
to
say
*NL*
in
a
choking
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
dog
,
''
Hal
replied
,
wiping
the
blood
from
his
mouth
as
he
came
*NL*
back
.
``
Get
out
of
my
way
,
or
I
'll
fix
you
.
I
'm
going
to
Dawson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
stood
between
him
and
Buck
,
and
evinced
no
intention
of
getting
*NL*
out
of
the
way
.
Hal
drew
his
long
hunting-knife
.
Mercedes
screamed
,
*NL*
cried
,
laughed
,
and
manifested
the
chaotic
abandonment
of
hysteria
.
*NL*
Thornton
rapped
Hal
's
knuckles
with
the
axe-handle
,
knocking
the
knife
*NL*
to
the
ground
.
He
rapped
his
knuckles
again
as
he
tried
to
pick
it
up
.
*NL*
Then
he
stooped
,
picked
it
up
himself
,
and
with
two
strokes
cut
Buck
's
*NL*
traces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hal
had
no
fight
left
in
him
.
Besides
,
his
hands
were
full
with
his
*NL*
sister
,
or
his
arms
,
rather
;
while
Buck
was
too
near
dead
to
be
of
*NL*
further
use
in
hauling
the
sled
.
A
few
minutes
later
they
pulled
out
*NL*
from
the
bank
and
down
the
river
.
Buck
heard
them
go
and
raised
his
head
*NL*
to
see
,
Pike
was
leading
,
Sol-leks
was
at
the
wheel
,
and
between
were
*NL*
Joe
and
Teek
.
They
were
limping
and
staggering
.
Mercedes
was
riding
the
*NL*
loaded
sled
.
Hal
guided
at
the
gee-pole
,
and
Charles
stumbled
along
in
*NL*
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Buck
watched
them
,
Thornton
knelt
beside
him
and
with
rough
,
kindly
*NL*
hands
searched
for
broken
bones
.
By
the
time
his
search
had
disclosed
*NL*
nothing
more
than
many
bruises
and
a
state
of
terrible
starvation
,
the
*NL*
sled
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
.
Dog
and
man
watched
it
crawling
along
*NL*
over
the
ice
.
Suddenly
,
they
saw
its
back
end
drop
down
,
as
into
a
rut
,
*NL*
and
the
gee-pole
,
with
Hal
clinging
to
it
,
jerk
into
the
air
.
Mercedes
's
*NL*
scream
came
to
their
ears
.
They
saw
Charles
turn
and
make
one
step
to
*NL*
run
back
,
and
then
a
whole
section
of
ice
give
way
and
dogs
and
humans
*NL*
disappear
.
A
yawning
hole
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
.
The
bottom
had
*NL*
dropped
out
of
the
trail
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thornton
and
Buck
looked
at
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
poor
devil
,
''
said
John
Thornton
,
and
Buck
licked
his
hand
.

Chapter
VI
.
For
the
Love
of
a
Man
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
John
Thornton
froze
his
feet
in
the
previous
December
his
partners
*NL*
had
made
him
comfortable
and
left
him
to
get
well
,
going
on
themselves
*NL*
up
the
river
to
get
out
a
raft
of
saw-logs
for
Dawson
.
He
was
still
*NL*
limping
slightly
at
the
time
he
rescued
Buck
,
but
with
the
continued
*NL*
warm
weather
even
the
slight
limp
left
him
.
And
here
,
lying
by
the
river
*NL*
bank
through
the
long
spring
days
,
watching
the
running
water
,
listening
*NL*
lazily
to
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
hum
of
nature
,
Buck
slowly
won
back
*NL*
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rest
comes
very
good
after
one
has
travelled
three
thousand
miles
,
*NL*
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
Buck
waxed
lazy
as
his
wounds
healed
,
his
*NL*
muscles
swelled
out
,
and
the
flesh
came
back
to
cover
his
bones
.
For
*NL*
that
matter
,
they
were
all
loafing
,
--
Buck
,
John
Thornton
,
and
Skeet
*NL*
and
Nig
,
--
waiting
for
the
raft
to
come
that
was
to
carry
them
down
to
*NL*
Dawson
.
Skeet
was
a
little
Irish
setter
who
early
made
friends
with
*NL*
Buck
,
who
,
in
a
dying
condition
,
was
unable
to
resent
her
first
*NL*
advances
.
She
had
the
doctor
trait
which
some
dogs
possess
;
and
as
a
*NL*
mother
cat
washes
her
kittens
,
so
she
washed
and
cleansed
Buck
's
*NL*
wounds
.
Regularly
,
each
morning
after
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
,
*NL*
she
performed
her
self-appointed
task
,
till
he
came
to
look
for
her
*NL*
ministrations
as
much
as
he
did
for
Thornton
's
.
Nig
,
equally
friendly
,
*NL*
though
less
demonstrative
,
was
a
huge
black
dog
,
half
bloodhound
and
*NL*
half
deerhound
,
with
eyes
that
laughed
and
a
boundless
good
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Buck
's
surprise
these
dogs
manifested
no
jealousy
toward
him
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
share
the
kindliness
and
largeness
of
John
Thornton
.
As
Buck
*NL*
grew
stronger
they
enticed
him
into
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
games
,
in
*NL*
which
Thornton
himself
could
not
forbear
to
join
;
and
in
this
fashion
*NL*
Buck
romped
through
his
convalescence
and
into
a
new
existence
.
Love
,
*NL*
genuine
passionate
love
,
was
his
for
the
first
time
.
This
he
had
never
*NL*
experienced
at
Judge
Miller
's
down
in
the
sun-kissed
Santa
Clara
Valley
.
*NL*
With
the
Judge
's
sons
,
hunting
and
tramping
,
it
had
been
a
working
*NL*
partnership
;
with
the
Judge
's
grandsons
,
a
sort
of
pompous
guardianship
;
*NL*
and
with
the
Judge
himself
,
a
stately
and
dignified
friendship
.
But
love
*NL*
that
was
feverish
and
burning
,
that
was
adoration
,
that
was
madness
,
it
*NL*
had
taken
John
Thornton
to
arouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
had
saved
his
life
,
which
was
something
;
but
,
further
,
he
was
*NL*
the
ideal
master
.
Other
men
saw
to
the
welfare
of
their
dogs
from
a
*NL*
sense
of
duty
and
business
expediency
;
he
saw
to
the
welfare
of
his
as
*NL*
if
they
were
his
own
children
,
because
he
could
not
help
it
.
And
he
saw
*NL*
further
.
He
never
forgot
a
kindly
greeting
or
a
cheering
word
,
and
to
*NL*
sit
down
for
a
long
talk
with
them
-LRB-
``
gas
''
he
called
it
-RRB-
was
as
much
his
*NL*
delight
as
theirs
.
He
had
a
way
of
taking
Buck
's
head
roughly
between
*NL*
his
hands
,
and
resting
his
own
head
upon
Buck
's
,
of
shaking
him
back
*NL*
and
forth
,
the
while
calling
him
ill
names
that
to
Buck
were
love
*NL*
names
.
Buck
knew
no
greater
joy
than
that
rough
embrace
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
murmured
oaths
,
and
at
each
jerk
back
and
forth
it
seemed
that
his
heart
*NL*
would
be
shaken
out
of
his
body
so
great
was
its
ecstasy
.
And
when
,
*NL*
released
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
his
mouth
laughing
,
his
eyes
eloquent
,
*NL*
his
throat
vibrant
with
unuttered
sound
,
and
in
that
fashion
remained
*NL*
without
movement
,
John
Thornton
would
reverently
exclaim
,
``
God
!
you
can
*NL*
all
but
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
had
a
trick
of
love
expression
that
was
akin
to
hurt
.
He
would
*NL*
often
seize
Thornton
's
hand
in
his
mouth
and
close
so
fiercely
that
the
*NL*
flesh
bore
the
impress
of
his
teeth
for
some
time
afterward
.
And
as
*NL*
Buck
understood
the
oaths
to
be
love
words
,
so
the
man
understood
this
*NL*
feigned
bite
for
a
caress
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
most
part
,
however
,
Buck
's
love
was
expressed
in
adoration
.
*NL*
While
he
went
wild
with
happiness
when
Thornton
touched
him
or
spoke
to
*NL*
him
,
he
did
not
seek
these
tokens
.
Unlike
Skeet
,
who
was
wont
to
shove
*NL*
her
nose
under
Thornton
's
hand
and
nudge
and
nudge
till
petted
,
or
Nig
,
*NL*
who
would
stalk
up
and
rest
his
great
head
on
Thornton
's
knee
,
Buck
was
*NL*
content
to
adore
at
a
distance
.
He
would
lie
by
the
hour
,
eager
,
alert
,
*NL*
at
Thornton
's
feet
,
looking
up
into
his
face
,
dwelling
upon
it
,
studying
*NL*
it
,
following
with
keenest
interest
each
fleeting
expression
,
every
*NL*
movement
or
change
of
feature
.
Or
,
as
chance
might
have
it
,
he
would
lie
*NL*
farther
away
,
to
the
side
or
rear
,
watching
the
outlines
of
the
man
and
*NL*
the
occasional
movements
of
his
body
.
And
often
,
such
was
the
communion
*NL*
in
which
they
lived
,
the
strength
of
Buck
's
gaze
would
draw
John
*NL*
Thornton
's
head
around
,
and
he
would
return
the
gaze
,
without
speech
,
*NL*
his
heart
shining
out
of
his
eyes
as
Buck
's
heart
shone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
after
his
rescue
,
Buck
did
not
like
Thornton
to
get
out
*NL*
of
his
sight
.
From
the
moment
he
left
the
tent
to
when
he
entered
it
*NL*
again
,
Buck
would
follow
at
his
heels
.
His
transient
masters
since
he
*NL*
had
come
into
the
Northland
had
bred
in
him
a
fear
that
no
master
could
*NL*
be
permanent
.
He
was
afraid
that
Thornton
would
pass
out
of
his
life
as
*NL*
Perrault
and
Francois
and
the
Scotch
half-breed
had
passed
out
.
Even
in
*NL*
the
night
,
in
his
dreams
,
he
was
haunted
by
this
fear
.
At
such
times
*NL*
he
would
shake
off
sleep
and
creep
through
the
chill
to
the
flap
of
*NL*
the
tent
,
where
he
would
stand
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
his
master
's
*NL*
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
this
great
love
he
bore
John
Thornton
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
bespeak
the
soft
civilizing
influence
,
the
strain
of
the
primitive
,
*NL*
which
the
Northland
had
aroused
in
him
,
remained
alive
and
active
.
*NL*
Faithfulness
and
devotion
,
things
born
of
fire
and
roof
,
were
his
;
yet
*NL*
he
retained
his
wildness
and
wiliness
.
He
was
a
thing
of
the
wild
,
come
*NL*
in
from
the
wild
to
sit
by
John
Thornton
's
fire
,
rather
than
a
dog
*NL*
of
the
soft
Southland
stamped
with
the
marks
of
generations
of
*NL*
civilization
.
Because
of
his
very
great
love
,
he
could
not
steal
from
*NL*
this
man
,
but
from
any
other
man
,
in
any
other
camp
,
he
did
not
hesitate
*NL*
an
instant
;
while
the
cunning
with
which
he
stole
enabled
him
to
escape
*NL*
detection
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
and
body
were
scored
by
the
teeth
of
many
dogs
,
and
he
*NL*
fought
as
fiercely
as
ever
and
more
shrewdly
.
Skeet
and
Nig
were
too
*NL*
good-natured
for
quarrelling
,
--
besides
,
they
belonged
to
John
Thornton
;
*NL*
but
the
strange
dog
,
no
matter
what
the
breed
or
valor
,
swiftly
*NL*
acknowledged
Buck
's
supremacy
or
found
himself
struggling
for
life
with
*NL*
a
terrible
antagonist
.
And
Buck
was
merciless
.
He
had
learned
well
the
*NL*
law
of
club
and
fang
,
and
he
never
forewent
an
advantage
or
drew
back
*NL*
from
a
foe
he
had
started
on
the
way
to
Death
.
He
had
lessoned
from
*NL*
Spitz
,
and
from
the
chief
fighting
dogs
of
the
police
and
mail
,
and
knew
*NL*
there
was
no
middle
course
.
He
must
master
or
be
mastered
;
while
to
show
*NL*
mercy
was
a
weakness
.
Mercy
did
not
exist
in
the
primordial
life
.
It
was
*NL*
misunderstood
for
fear
,
and
such
misunderstandings
made
for
death
.
Kill
*NL*
or
be
killed
,
eat
or
be
eaten
,
was
the
law
;
and
this
mandate
,
down
out
*NL*
of
the
depths
of
Time
,
he
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
older
than
the
days
he
had
seen
and
the
breaths
he
had
drawn
.
He
*NL*
linked
the
past
with
the
present
,
and
the
eternity
behind
him
throbbed
*NL*
through
him
in
a
mighty
rhythm
to
which
he
swayed
as
the
tides
and
*NL*
seasons
swayed
.
He
sat
by
John
Thornton
's
fire
,
a
broad-breasted
dog
,
*NL*
white-fanged
and
long-furred
;
but
behind
him
were
the
shades
of
all
*NL*
manner
of
dogs
,
half-wolves
and
wild
wolves
,
urgent
and
prompting
,
*NL*
tasting
the
savor
of
the
meat
he
ate
,
thirsting
for
the
water
he
drank
,
*NL*
scenting
the
wind
with
him
,
listening
with
him
and
telling
him
the
*NL*
sounds
made
by
the
wild
life
in
the
forest
,
dictating
his
moods
,
*NL*
directing
his
actions
,
lying
down
to
sleep
with
him
when
he
lay
down
,
*NL*
and
dreaming
with
him
and
beyond
him
and
becoming
themselves
the
stuff
*NL*
of
his
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
peremptorily
did
these
shades
beckon
him
,
that
each
day
mankind
and
*NL*
the
claims
of
mankind
slipped
farther
from
him
.
Deep
in
the
forest
a
*NL*
call
was
sounding
,
and
as
often
as
he
heard
this
call
,
mysteriously
*NL*
thrilling
and
luring
,
he
felt
compelled
to
turn
his
back
upon
the
fire
*NL*
and
the
beaten
earth
around
it
,
and
to
plunge
into
the
forest
,
and
on
*NL*
and
on
,
he
knew
not
where
or
why
;
nor
did
he
wonder
where
or
why
,
the
*NL*
call
sounding
imperiously
,
deep
in
the
forest
.
But
as
often
as
he
gained
*NL*
the
soft
unbroken
earth
and
the
green
shade
,
the
love
for
John
Thornton
*NL*
drew
him
back
to
the
fire
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
alone
held
him
.
The
rest
of
mankind
was
as
nothing
.
Chance
*NL*
travellers
might
praise
or
pet
him
;
but
he
was
cold
under
it
all
,
*NL*
and
from
a
too
demonstrative
man
he
would
get
up
and
walk
away
.
When
*NL*
Thornton
's
partners
,
Hans
and
Pete
,
arrived
on
the
long-expected
raft
,
*NL*
Buck
refused
to
notice
them
till
he
learned
they
were
close
to
Thornton
;
*NL*
after
that
he
tolerated
them
in
a
passive
sort
of
way
,
accepting
favors
*NL*
from
them
as
though
he
favored
them
by
accepting
.
They
were
of
the
same
*NL*
large
type
as
Thornton
,
living
close
to
the
earth
,
thinking
simply
and
*NL*
seeing
clearly
;
and
ere
they
swung
the
raft
into
the
big
eddy
by
the
*NL*
saw-mill
at
Dawson
,
they
understood
Buck
and
his
ways
,
and
did
not
*NL*
insist
upon
an
intimacy
such
as
obtained
with
Skeet
and
Nig
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Thornton
,
however
,
his
love
seemed
to
grow
and
grow
.
He
,
alone
among
*NL*
men
,
could
put
a
pack
upon
Buck
's
back
in
the
summer
travelling
.
Nothing
*NL*
was
too
great
for
Buck
to
do
,
when
Thornton
commanded
.
One
day
-LRB-
they
had
*NL*
grub-staked
themselves
from
the
proceeds
of
the
raft
and
left
Dawson
*NL*
for
the
head-waters
of
the
Tanana
-RRB-
the
men
and
dogs
were
sitting
on
the
*NL*
crest
of
a
cliff
which
fell
away
,
straight
down
,
to
naked
bed-rock
three
*NL*
hundred
feet
below
.
John
Thornton
was
sitting
near
the
edge
,
Buck
at
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
A
thoughtless
whim
seized
Thornton
,
and
he
drew
the
attention
*NL*
of
Hans
and
Pete
to
the
experiment
he
had
in
mind
.
``
Jump
,
Buck
!
''
he
*NL*
commanded
,
sweeping
his
arm
out
and
over
the
chasm
.
The
next
instant
he
*NL*
was
grappling
with
Buck
on
the
extreme
edge
,
while
Hans
and
Pete
were
*NL*
dragging
them
back
into
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
uncanny
,
''
Pete
said
,
after
it
was
over
and
they
had
caught
their
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
shook
his
head
.
``
No
,
it
is
splendid
,
and
it
is
terrible
,
too
.
*NL*
Do
you
know
,
it
sometimes
makes
me
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
hankering
to
be
the
man
that
lays
hands
on
you
while
he
's
*NL*
around
,
''
Pete
announced
conclusively
,
nodding
his
head
toward
Buck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Py
Jingo
!
''
was
Hans
's
contribution
.
``
Not
mineself
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
Circle
City
,
ere
the
year
was
out
,
that
Pete
's
apprehensions
*NL*
were
realized
.
``
Black
''
Burton
,
a
man
evil-tempered
and
malicious
,
had
*NL*
been
picking
a
quarrel
with
a
tenderfoot
at
the
bar
,
when
Thornton
*NL*
stepped
good-naturedly
between
.
Buck
,
as
was
his
custom
,
was
lying
in
a
*NL*
corner
,
head
on
paws
,
watching
his
master
's
every
action
.
Burton
struck
*NL*
out
,
without
warning
,
straight
from
the
shoulder
.
Thornton
was
sent
*NL*
spinning
,
and
saved
himself
from
falling
only
by
clutching
the
rail
of
*NL*
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
were
looking
on
heard
what
was
neither
bark
nor
yelp
,
but
a
*NL*
something
which
is
best
described
as
a
roar
,
and
they
saw
Buck
's
body
*NL*
rise
up
in
the
air
as
he
left
the
floor
for
Burton
's
throat
.
The
man
*NL*
saved
his
life
by
instinctively
throwing
out
his
arm
,
but
was
hurled
*NL*
backward
to
the
floor
with
Buck
on
top
of
him
.
Buck
loosed
his
teeth
*NL*
from
the
flesh
of
the
arm
and
drove
in
again
for
the
throat
.
This
time
*NL*
the
man
succeeded
only
in
partly
blocking
,
and
his
throat
was
torn
open
.
*NL*
Then
the
crowd
was
upon
Buck
,
and
he
was
driven
off
;
but
while
a
surgeon
*NL*
checked
the
bleeding
,
he
prowled
up
and
down
,
growling
furiously
,
*NL*
attempting
to
rush
in
,
and
being
forced
back
by
an
array
of
hostile
*NL*
clubs
.
A
``
miners
'
meeting
,
''
called
on
the
spot
,
decided
that
the
dog
had
*NL*
sufficient
provocation
,
and
Buck
was
discharged
.
But
his
reputation
was
*NL*
made
,
and
from
that
day
his
name
spread
through
every
camp
in
Alaska
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
,
in
the
fall
of
the
year
,
he
saved
John
Thornton
's
life
in
*NL*
quite
another
fashion
.
The
three
partners
were
lining
a
long
and
narrow
*NL*
poling-boat
down
a
bad
stretch
of
rapids
on
the
Forty-Mile
Creek
.
Hans
*NL*
and
Pete
moved
along
the
bank
,
snubbing
with
a
thin
Manila
rope
from
*NL*
tree
to
tree
,
while
Thornton
remained
in
the
boat
,
helping
its
descent
*NL*
by
means
of
a
pole
,
and
shouting
directions
to
the
shore
.
Buck
,
on
the
*NL*
bank
,
worried
and
anxious
,
kept
abreast
of
the
boat
,
his
eyes
never
off
*NL*
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
particularly
bad
spot
,
where
a
ledge
of
barely
submerged
rocks
*NL*
jutted
out
into
the
river
,
Hans
cast
off
the
rope
,
and
,
while
Thornton
*NL*
poled
the
boat
out
into
the
stream
,
ran
down
the
bank
with
the
end
in
*NL*
his
hand
to
snub
the
boat
when
it
had
cleared
the
ledge
.
This
it
did
,
*NL*
and
was
flying
down-stream
in
a
current
as
swift
as
a
mill-race
,
when
*NL*
Hans
checked
it
with
the
rope
and
checked
too
suddenly
.
The
boat
flirted
*NL*
over
and
snubbed
in
to
the
bank
bottom
up
,
while
Thornton
,
flung
sheer
*NL*
out
of
it
,
was
carried
down-stream
toward
the
worst
part
of
the
rapids
,
*NL*
a
stretch
of
wild
water
in
which
no
swimmer
could
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
had
sprung
in
on
the
instant
;
and
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
*NL*
yards
,
amid
a
mad
swirl
of
water
,
he
overhauled
Thornton
.
When
he
felt
*NL*
him
grasp
his
tail
,
Buck
headed
for
the
bank
,
swimming
with
all
his
*NL*
splendid
strength
.
But
the
progress
shoreward
was
slow
;
the
progress
*NL*
down-stream
amazingly
rapid
.
From
below
came
the
fatal
roaring
where
the
*NL*
wild
current
went
wilder
and
was
rent
in
shreds
and
spray
by
the
rocks
*NL*
which
thrust
through
like
the
teeth
of
an
enormous
comb
.
The
suck
of
the
*NL*
water
as
it
took
the
beginning
of
the
last
steep
pitch
was
frightful
,
*NL*
and
Thornton
knew
that
the
shore
was
impossible
.
He
scraped
furiously
*NL*
over
a
rock
,
bruised
across
a
second
,
and
struck
a
third
with
crushing
*NL*
force
.
He
clutched
its
slippery
top
with
both
hands
,
releasing
Buck
,
and
*NL*
above
the
roar
of
the
churning
water
shouted
:
``
Go
,
Buck
!
Go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
could
not
hold
his
own
,
and
swept
on
down-stream
,
struggling
*NL*
desperately
,
but
unable
to
win
back
.
When
he
heard
Thornton
's
command
*NL*
repeated
,
he
partly
reared
out
of
the
water
,
throwing
his
head
high
,
as
*NL*
though
for
a
last
look
,
then
turned
obediently
toward
the
bank
.
He
swam
*NL*
powerfully
and
was
dragged
ashore
by
Pete
and
Hans
at
the
very
point
*NL*
where
swimming
ceased
to
be
possible
and
destruction
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
that
the
time
a
man
could
cling
to
a
slippery
rock
in
the
face
*NL*
of
that
driving
current
was
a
matter
of
minutes
,
and
they
ran
as
fast
as
*NL*
they
could
up
the
bank
to
a
point
far
above
where
Thornton
was
hanging
*NL*
on
.
They
attached
the
line
with
which
they
had
been
snubbing
the
boat
to
*NL*
Buck
's
neck
and
shoulders
,
being
careful
that
it
should
neither
strangle
*NL*
him
nor
impede
his
swimming
,
and
launched
him
into
the
stream
.
He
struck
*NL*
out
boldly
,
but
not
straight
enough
into
the
stream
.
He
discovered
the
*NL*
mistake
too
late
,
when
Thornton
was
abreast
of
him
and
a
bare
half-dozen
*NL*
strokes
away
while
he
was
being
carried
helplessly
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hans
promptly
snubbed
with
the
rope
,
as
though
Buck
were
a
boat
.
The
*NL*
rope
thus
tightening
on
him
in
the
sweep
of
the
current
,
he
was
jerked
*NL*
under
the
surface
,
and
under
the
surface
he
remained
till
his
body
*NL*
struck
against
the
bank
and
he
was
hauled
out
.
He
was
half
drowned
,
and
*NL*
Hans
and
Pete
threw
themselves
upon
him
,
pounding
the
breath
into
him
*NL*
and
the
water
out
of
him
.
He
staggered
to
his
feet
and
fell
down
.
The
*NL*
faint
sound
of
Thornton
's
voice
came
to
them
,
and
though
they
could
not
*NL*
make
out
the
words
of
it
,
they
knew
that
he
was
in
his
extremity
.
His
*NL*
master
's
voice
acted
on
Buck
like
an
electric
shock
,
He
sprang
to
his
*NL*
feet
and
ran
up
the
bank
ahead
of
the
men
to
the
point
of
his
previous
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
rope
was
attached
and
he
was
launched
,
and
again
he
struck
*NL*
out
,
but
this
time
straight
into
the
stream
.
He
had
miscalculated
once
,
*NL*
but
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
it
a
second
time
.
Hans
paid
out
the
rope
,
*NL*
permitting
no
slack
,
while
Pete
kept
it
clear
of
coils
.
Buck
held
on
*NL*
till
he
was
on
a
line
straight
above
Thornton
;
then
he
turned
,
and
with
*NL*
the
speed
of
an
express
train
headed
down
upon
him
.
Thornton
saw
him
*NL*
coming
,
and
,
as
Buck
struck
him
like
a
battering
ram
,
with
the
whole
*NL*
force
of
the
current
behind
him
,
he
reached
up
and
closed
with
both
arms
*NL*
around
the
shaggy
neck
.
Hans
snubbed
the
rope
around
the
tree
,
and
*NL*
Buck
and
Thornton
were
jerked
under
the
water
.
Strangling
,
suffocating
,
*NL*
sometimes
one
uppermost
and
sometimes
the
other
,
dragging
over
the
*NL*
jagged
bottom
,
smashing
against
rocks
and
snags
,
they
veered
in
to
the
*NL*
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
came
to
,
belly
downward
and
being
violently
propelled
back
*NL*
and
forth
across
a
drift
log
by
Hans
and
Pete
.
His
first
glance
was
for
*NL*
Buck
,
over
whose
limp
and
apparently
lifeless
body
Nig
was
setting
up
a
*NL*
howl
,
while
Skeet
was
licking
the
wet
face
and
closed
eyes
.
Thornton
was
*NL*
himself
bruised
and
battered
,
and
he
went
carefully
over
Buck
's
body
,
*NL*
when
he
had
been
brought
around
,
finding
three
broken
ribs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
settles
it
,
''
he
announced
.
``
We
camp
right
here
.
''
And
camp
they
*NL*
did
,
till
Buck
's
ribs
knitted
and
he
was
able
to
travel
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
winter
,
at
Dawson
,
Buck
performed
another
exploit
,
not
so
heroic
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
one
that
put
his
name
many
notches
higher
on
the
totem-pole
*NL*
of
Alaskan
fame
.
This
exploit
was
particularly
gratifying
to
the
three
*NL*
men
;
for
they
stood
in
need
of
the
outfit
which
it
furnished
,
and
were
*NL*
enabled
to
make
a
long-desired
trip
into
the
virgin
East
,
where
miners
*NL*
had
not
yet
appeared
.
It
was
brought
about
by
a
conversation
in
the
*NL*
Eldorado
Saloon
,
in
which
men
waxed
boastful
of
their
favorite
dogs
.
*NL*
Buck
,
because
of
his
record
,
was
the
target
for
these
men
,
and
Thornton
*NL*
was
driven
stoutly
to
defend
him
.
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
one
man
*NL*
stated
that
his
dog
could
start
a
sled
with
five
hundred
pounds
and
*NL*
walk
off
with
it
;
a
second
bragged
six
hundred
for
his
dog
;
and
a
third
,
*NL*
seven
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
pooh
!
''
said
John
Thornton
;
``
Buck
can
start
a
thousand
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
break
it
out
?
and
walk
off
with
it
for
a
hundred
yards
?
''
demanded
*NL*
Matthewson
,
a
Bonanza
King
,
he
of
the
seven
hundred
vaunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
break
it
out
,
and
walk
off
with
it
for
a
hundred
yards
,
''
John
*NL*
Thornton
said
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Matthewson
said
,
slowly
and
deliberately
,
so
that
all
could
*NL*
hear
,
``
I
've
got
a
thousand
dollars
that
says
he
ca
n't
.
And
there
it
*NL*
is
.
''
So
saying
,
he
slammed
a
sack
of
gold
dust
of
the
size
of
a
bologna
*NL*
sausage
down
upon
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
spoke
.
Thornton
's
bluff
,
if
bluff
it
was
,
had
been
called
.
He
*NL*
could
feel
a
flush
of
warm
blood
creeping
up
his
face
.
His
tongue
had
*NL*
tricked
him
.
He
did
not
know
whether
Buck
could
start
a
thousand
pounds
.
*NL*
Half
a
ton
!
The
enormousness
of
it
appalled
him
.
He
had
great
faith
in
*NL*
Buck
's
strength
and
had
often
thought
him
capable
of
starting
such
a
*NL*
load
;
but
never
,
as
now
,
had
he
faced
the
possibility
of
it
,
the
eyes
*NL*
of
a
dozen
men
fixed
upon
him
,
silent
and
waiting
.
Further
,
he
had
no
*NL*
thousand
dollars
;
nor
had
Hans
or
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
sled
standing
outside
now
,
with
twenty
fiftypound
sacks
of
*NL*
flour
on
it
,
''
Matthewson
went
on
with
brutal
directness
;
``
so
do
n't
let
*NL*
that
hinder
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
did
not
reply
.
He
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
He
glanced
from
*NL*
face
to
face
in
the
absent
way
of
a
man
who
has
lost
the
power
of
*NL*
thought
and
is
seeking
somewhere
to
find
the
thing
that
will
start
*NL*
it
going
again
.
The
face
of
Jim
O'Brien
,
a
Mastodon
King
and
old-time
*NL*
comrade
,
caught
his
eyes
.
It
was
as
a
cue
to
him
,
seeming
to
rouse
him
*NL*
to
do
what
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
lend
me
a
thousand
?
''
he
asked
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
answered
O'Brien
,
thumping
down
a
plethoric
sack
by
the
side
of
*NL*
Matthewson
's
.
``
Though
it
's
little
faith
I
'm
having
,
John
,
that
the
beast
*NL*
can
do
the
trick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Eldorado
emptied
its
occupants
into
the
street
to
see
the
test
.
The
*NL*
tables
were
deserted
,
and
the
dealers
and
gamekeepers
came
forth
to
see
*NL*
the
outcome
of
the
wager
and
to
lay
odds
.
Several
hundred
men
,
furred
*NL*
and
mittened
,
banked
around
the
sled
within
easy
distance
.
Matthewson
's
*NL*
sled
,
loaded
with
a
thousand
pounds
of
flour
,
had
been
standing
for
a
*NL*
couple
of
hours
,
and
in
the
intense
cold
-LRB-
it
was
sixty
below
zero
-RRB-
the
*NL*
runners
had
frozen
fast
to
the
hard-packed
snow
.
Men
offered
odds
of
two
*NL*
to
one
that
Buck
could
not
budge
the
sled
.
A
quibble
arose
concerning
*NL*
the
phrase
``
break
out
.
''
O'Brien
contended
it
was
Thornton
's
privilege
*NL*
to
knock
the
runners
loose
,
leaving
Buck
to
``
break
it
out
''
from
a
dead
*NL*
standstill
.
Matthewson
insisted
that
the
phrase
included
breaking
the
*NL*
runners
from
the
frozen
grip
of
the
snow
.
A
majority
of
the
men
who
had
*NL*
witnessed
the
making
of
the
bet
decided
in
his
favor
,
whereat
the
odds
*NL*
went
up
to
three
to
one
against
Buck
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
takers
.
Not
a
man
believed
him
capable
of
the
feat
.
*NL*
Thornton
had
been
hurried
into
the
wager
,
heavy
with
doubt
;
and
now
that
*NL*
he
looked
at
the
sled
itself
,
the
concrete
fact
,
with
the
regular
team
*NL*
of
ten
dogs
curled
up
in
the
snow
before
it
,
the
more
impossible
the
*NL*
task
appeared
.
Matthewson
waxed
jubilant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
to
one
!
''
he
proclaimed
.
``
I
'll
lay
you
another
thousand
at
that
*NL*
figure
,
Thornton
.
What
d'ye
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
's
doubt
was
strong
in
his
face
,
but
his
fighting
spirit
was
*NL*
aroused
--
the
fighting
spirit
that
soars
above
odds
,
fails
to
recognize
*NL*
the
impossible
,
and
is
deaf
to
all
save
the
clamor
for
battle
.
He
called
*NL*
Hans
and
Pete
to
him
.
Their
sacks
were
slim
,
and
with
his
own
the
three
*NL*
partners
could
rake
together
only
two
hundred
dollars
.
In
the
ebb
of
*NL*
their
fortunes
,
this
sum
was
their
total
capital
;
yet
they
laid
it
*NL*
unhesitatingly
against
Matthewson
's
six
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
team
of
ten
dogs
was
unhitched
,
and
Buck
,
with
his
own
harness
,
was
*NL*
put
into
the
sled
.
He
had
caught
the
contagion
of
the
excitement
,
and
*NL*
he
felt
that
in
some
way
he
must
do
a
great
thing
for
John
Thornton
.
*NL*
Murmurs
of
admiration
at
his
splendid
appearance
went
up
.
He
was
in
*NL*
perfect
condition
,
without
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
,
and
the
one
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
that
he
weighed
were
so
many
pounds
of
grit
and
*NL*
virility
.
His
furry
coat
shone
with
the
sheen
of
silk
.
Down
the
neck
and
*NL*
across
the
shoulders
,
his
mane
,
in
repose
as
it
was
,
half
bristled
and
*NL*
seemed
to
lift
with
every
movement
,
as
though
excess
of
vigor
made
each
*NL*
particular
hair
alive
and
active
.
The
great
breast
and
heavy
fore
legs
*NL*
were
no
more
than
in
proportion
with
the
rest
of
the
body
,
where
the
*NL*
muscles
showed
in
tight
rolls
underneath
the
skin
.
Men
felt
these
*NL*
muscles
and
proclaimed
them
hard
as
iron
,
and
the
odds
went
down
to
two
*NL*
to
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gad
,
sir
!
Gad
,
sir
!
''
stuttered
a
member
of
the
latest
dynasty
,
a
king
*NL*
of
the
Skookum
Benches
.
``
I
offer
you
eight
hundred
for
him
,
sir
,
before
*NL*
the
test
,
sir
;
eight
hundred
just
as
he
stands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
shook
his
head
and
stepped
to
Buck
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
stand
off
from
him
,
''
Matthewson
protested
.
``
Free
play
and
*NL*
plenty
of
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
fell
silent
;
only
could
be
heard
the
voices
of
the
gamblers
*NL*
vainly
offering
two
to
one
.
Everybody
acknowledged
Buck
a
magnificent
*NL*
animal
,
but
twenty
fifty-pound
sacks
of
flour
bulked
too
large
in
their
*NL*
eyes
for
them
to
loosen
their
pouch-strings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
knelt
down
by
Buck
's
side
.
He
took
his
head
in
his
two
hands
*NL*
and
rested
cheek
on
cheek
.
He
did
not
playfully
shake
him
,
as
was
his
*NL*
wont
,
or
murmur
soft
love
curses
;
but
he
whispered
in
his
ear
.
``
As
you
*NL*
love
me
,
Buck
.
As
you
love
me
,
''
was
what
he
whispered
.
Buck
whined
with
*NL*
suppressed
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
was
watching
curiously
.
The
affair
was
growing
mysterious
.
It
*NL*
seemed
like
a
conjuration
.
As
Thornton
got
to
his
feet
,
Buck
seized
his
*NL*
mittened
hand
between
his
jaws
,
pressing
in
with
his
teeth
and
releasing
*NL*
slowly
,
half-reluctantly
.
It
was
the
answer
,
in
terms
,
not
of
speech
,
*NL*
but
of
love
.
Thornton
stepped
well
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Buck
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
tightened
the
traces
,
then
slacked
them
for
a
matter
of
several
*NL*
inches
.
It
was
the
way
he
had
learned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
!
''
Thornton
's
voice
rang
out
,
sharp
in
the
tense
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
swung
to
the
right
,
ending
the
movement
in
a
plunge
that
took
up
*NL*
the
slack
and
with
a
sudden
jerk
arrested
his
one
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
pounds
.
The
load
quivered
,
and
from
under
the
runners
arose
a
crisp
*NL*
crackling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Haw
!
''
Thornton
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
duplicated
the
manoeuvre
,
this
time
to
the
left
.
The
crackling
*NL*
turned
into
a
snapping
,
the
sled
pivoting
and
the
runners
slipping
and
*NL*
grating
several
inches
to
the
side
.
The
sled
was
broken
out
.
Men
were
*NL*
holding
their
breaths
,
intensely
unconscious
of
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
MUSH
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
's
command
cracked
out
like
a
pistol-shot
.
Buck
threw
himself
*NL*
forward
,
tightening
the
traces
with
a
jarring
lunge
.
His
whole
body
*NL*
was
gathered
compactly
together
in
the
tremendous
effort
,
the
muscles
*NL*
writhing
and
knotting
like
live
things
under
the
silky
fur
.
His
great
*NL*
chest
was
low
to
the
ground
,
his
head
forward
and
down
,
while
his
*NL*
feet
were
flying
like
mad
,
the
claws
scarring
the
hard-packed
snow
in
*NL*
parallel
grooves
.
The
sled
swayed
and
trembled
,
half-started
forward
.
*NL*
One
of
his
feet
slipped
,
and
one
man
groaned
aloud
.
Then
the
sled
*NL*
lurched
ahead
in
what
appeared
a
rapid
succession
of
jerks
,
though
it
*NL*
never
really
came
to
a
dead
stop
again
...
half
an
inch
...
an
inch
...
two
*NL*
inches
...
The
jerks
perceptibly
diminished
;
as
the
sled
gained
momentum
,
*NL*
he
caught
them
up
,
till
it
was
moving
steadily
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
gasped
and
began
to
breathe
again
,
unaware
that
for
a
moment
they
*NL*
had
ceased
to
breathe
.
Thornton
was
running
behind
,
encouraging
Buck
*NL*
with
short
,
cheery
words
.
The
distance
had
been
measured
off
,
and
as
he
*NL*
neared
the
pile
of
firewood
which
marked
the
end
of
the
hundred
yards
,
*NL*
a
cheer
began
to
grow
and
grow
,
which
burst
into
a
roar
as
he
passed
*NL*
the
firewood
and
halted
at
command
.
Every
man
was
tearing
himself
loose
,
*NL*
even
Matthewson
.
Hats
and
mittens
were
flying
in
the
air
.
Men
were
*NL*
shaking
hands
,
it
did
not
matter
with
whom
,
and
bubbling
over
in
a
*NL*
general
incoherent
babel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Thornton
fell
on
his
knees
beside
Buck
.
Head
was
against
head
,
*NL*
and
he
was
shaking
him
back
and
forth
.
Those
who
hurried
up
heard
him
*NL*
cursing
Buck
,
and
he
cursed
him
long
and
fervently
,
and
softly
and
*NL*
lovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gad
,
sir
!
Gad
,
sir
!
''
spluttered
the
Skookum
Bench
king
.
``
I
'll
give
you
*NL*
a
thousand
for
him
,
sir
,
a
thousand
,
sir
--
twelve
hundred
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
rose
to
his
feet
.
His
eyes
were
wet
.
The
tears
were
streaming
*NL*
frankly
down
his
cheeks
.
``
Sir
,
''
he
said
to
the
Skookum
Bench
king
,
``
no
,
*NL*
sir
.
You
can
go
to
hell
,
sir
.
It
's
the
best
I
can
do
for
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
seized
Thornton
's
hand
in
his
teeth
.
Thornton
shook
him
back
and
*NL*
forth
.
As
though
animated
by
a
common
impulse
,
the
onlookers
drew
back
*NL*
to
a
respectful
distance
;
nor
were
they
again
indiscreet
enough
to
*NL*
interrupt

Chapter
VII
.
The
Sounding
of
the
Call
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Buck
earned
sixteen
hundred
dollars
in
five
minutes
for
John
*NL*
Thornton
,
he
made
it
possible
for
his
master
to
pay
off
certain
debts
*NL*
and
to
journey
with
his
partners
into
the
East
after
a
fabled
lost
mine
,
*NL*
the
history
of
which
was
as
old
as
the
history
of
the
country
.
Many
men
*NL*
had
sought
it
;
few
had
found
it
;
and
more
than
a
few
there
were
who
had
*NL*
never
returned
from
the
quest
.
This
lost
mine
was
steeped
in
tragedy
and
*NL*
shrouded
in
mystery
.
No
one
knew
of
the
first
man
.
The
oldest
tradition
*NL*
stopped
before
it
got
back
to
him
.
From
the
beginning
there
had
been
an
*NL*
ancient
and
ramshackle
cabin
.
Dying
men
had
sworn
to
it
,
and
to
the
mine
*NL*
the
site
of
which
it
marked
,
clinching
their
testimony
with
nuggets
that
*NL*
were
unlike
any
known
grade
of
gold
in
the
Northland
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
living
man
had
looted
this
treasure
house
,
and
the
dead
were
*NL*
dead
;
wherefore
John
Thornton
and
Pete
and
Hans
,
with
Buck
and
half
a
*NL*
dozen
other
dogs
,
faced
into
the
East
on
an
unknown
trail
to
achieve
*NL*
where
men
and
dogs
as
good
as
themselves
had
failed
.
They
sledded
*NL*
seventy
miles
up
the
Yukon
,
swung
to
the
left
into
the
Stewart
River
,
*NL*
passed
the
Mayo
and
the
McQuestion
,
and
held
on
until
the
Stewart
itself
*NL*
became
a
streamlet
,
threading
the
upstanding
peaks
which
marked
the
*NL*
backbone
of
the
continent
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thornton
asked
little
of
man
or
nature
.
He
was
unafraid
of
the
*NL*
wild
.
With
a
handful
of
salt
and
a
rifle
he
could
plunge
into
the
*NL*
wilderness
and
fare
wherever
he
pleased
and
as
long
as
he
pleased
.
Being
*NL*
in
no
haste
,
Indian
fashion
,
he
hunted
his
dinner
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
day
's
travel
;
and
if
he
failed
to
find
it
,
like
the
Indian
,
he
kept
on
*NL*
travelling
,
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
come
*NL*
to
it
.
So
,
on
this
great
journey
into
the
East
,
straight
meat
was
the
*NL*
bill
of
fare
,
ammunition
and
tools
principally
made
up
the
load
on
the
*NL*
sled
,
and
the
time-card
was
drawn
upon
the
limitless
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Buck
it
was
boundless
delight
,
this
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
indefinite
*NL*
wandering
through
strange
places
.
For
weeks
at
a
time
they
would
hold
*NL*
on
steadily
,
day
after
day
;
and
for
weeks
upon
end
they
would
camp
,
here
*NL*
and
there
,
the
dogs
loafing
and
the
men
burning
holes
through
frozen
*NL*
muck
and
gravel
and
washing
countless
pans
of
dirt
by
the
heat
of
the
*NL*
fire
.
Sometimes
they
went
hungry
,
sometimes
they
feasted
riotously
,
all
*NL*
according
to
the
abundance
of
game
and
the
fortune
of
hunting
.
Summer
*NL*
arrived
,
and
dogs
and
men
packed
on
their
backs
,
rafted
across
blue
*NL*
mountain
lakes
,
and
descended
or
ascended
unknown
rivers
in
slender
*NL*
boats
whipsawed
from
the
standing
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
came
and
went
,
and
back
and
forth
they
twisted
through
the
*NL*
uncharted
vastness
,
where
no
men
were
and
yet
where
men
had
been
if
*NL*
the
Lost
Cabin
were
true
.
They
went
across
divides
in
summer
blizzards
,
*NL*
shivered
under
the
midnight
sun
on
naked
mountains
between
the
timber
*NL*
line
and
the
eternal
snows
,
dropped
into
summer
valleys
amid
swarming
*NL*
gnats
and
flies
,
and
in
the
shadows
of
glaciers
picked
strawberries
and
*NL*
flowers
as
ripe
and
fair
as
any
the
Southland
could
boast
.
In
the
fall
*NL*
of
the
year
they
penetrated
a
weird
lake
country
,
sad
and
silent
,
*NL*
where
wildfowl
had
been
,
but
where
then
there
was
no
life
nor
sign
of
*NL*
life
--
only
the
blowing
of
chill
winds
,
the
forming
of
ice
in
sheltered
*NL*
places
,
and
the
melancholy
rippling
of
waves
on
lonely
beaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
through
another
winter
they
wandered
on
the
obliterated
trails
of
*NL*
men
who
had
gone
before
.
Once
,
they
came
upon
a
path
blazed
through
the
*NL*
forest
,
an
ancient
path
,
and
the
Lost
Cabin
seemed
very
near
.
But
the
*NL*
path
began
nowhere
and
ended
nowhere
,
and
it
remained
mystery
,
as
the
*NL*
man
who
made
it
and
the
reason
he
made
it
remained
mystery
.
Another
time
*NL*
they
chanced
upon
the
time-graven
wreckage
of
a
hunting
lodge
,
and
*NL*
amid
the
shreds
of
rotted
blankets
John
Thornton
found
a
long-barrelled
*NL*
flint-lock
.
He
knew
it
for
a
Hudson
Bay
Company
gun
of
the
young
days
*NL*
in
the
Northwest
,
when
such
a
gun
was
worth
its
height
in
beaver
skins
*NL*
packed
flat
,
And
that
was
all
--
no
hint
as
to
the
man
who
in
an
early
day
*NL*
had
reared
the
lodge
and
left
the
gun
among
the
blankets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
came
on
once
more
,
and
at
the
end
of
all
their
wandering
they
*NL*
found
,
not
the
Lost
Cabin
,
but
a
shallow
placer
in
a
broad
valley
where
*NL*
the
gold
showed
like
yellow
butter
across
the
bottom
of
the
washing-pan
.
*NL*
They
sought
no
farther
.
Each
day
they
worked
earned
them
thousands
of
*NL*
dollars
in
clean
dust
and
nuggets
,
and
they
worked
every
day
.
The
gold
*NL*
was
sacked
in
moose-hide
bags
,
fifty
pounds
to
the
bag
,
and
piled
*NL*
like
so
much
firewood
outside
the
spruce-bough
lodge
.
Like
giants
they
*NL*
toiled
,
days
flashing
on
the
heels
of
days
like
dreams
as
they
heaped
*NL*
the
treasure
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
for
the
dogs
to
do
,
save
the
hauling
in
of
meat
now
*NL*
and
again
that
Thornton
killed
,
and
Buck
spent
long
hours
musing
by
*NL*
the
fire
.
The
vision
of
the
short-legged
hairy
man
came
to
him
more
*NL*
frequently
,
now
that
there
was
little
work
to
be
done
;
and
often
,
*NL*
blinking
by
the
fire
,
Buck
wandered
with
him
in
that
other
world
which
*NL*
he
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
salient
thing
of
this
other
world
seemed
fear
.
When
he
watched
the
*NL*
hairy
man
sleeping
by
the
fire
,
head
between
his
knees
and
hands
*NL*
clasped
above
,
Buck
saw
that
he
slept
restlessly
,
with
many
starts
and
*NL*
awakenings
,
at
which
times
he
would
peer
fearfully
into
the
darkness
*NL*
and
fling
more
wood
upon
the
fire
.
Did
they
walk
by
the
beach
of
a
sea
,
*NL*
where
the
hairy
man
gathered
shellfish
and
ate
them
as
he
gathered
,
*NL*
it
was
with
eyes
that
roved
everywhere
for
hidden
danger
and
with
legs
*NL*
prepared
to
run
like
the
wind
at
its
first
appearance
.
Through
the
*NL*
forest
they
crept
noiselessly
,
Buck
at
the
hairy
man
's
heels
;
and
they
*NL*
were
alert
and
vigilant
,
the
pair
of
them
,
ears
twitching
and
moving
and
*NL*
nostrils
quivering
,
for
the
man
heard
and
smelled
as
keenly
as
Buck
.
The
*NL*
hairy
man
could
spring
up
into
the
trees
and
travel
ahead
as
fast
as
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
swinging
by
the
arms
from
limb
to
limb
,
sometimes
a
dozen
*NL*
feet
apart
,
letting
go
and
catching
,
never
falling
,
never
missing
his
*NL*
grip
.
In
fact
,
he
seemed
as
much
at
home
among
the
trees
as
on
the
*NL*
ground
;
and
Buck
had
memories
of
nights
of
vigil
spent
beneath
trees
*NL*
wherein
the
hairy
man
roosted
,
holding
on
tightly
as
he
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
closely
akin
to
the
visions
of
the
hairy
man
was
the
call
still
*NL*
sounding
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
.
It
filled
him
with
a
great
unrest
*NL*
and
strange
desires
.
It
caused
him
to
feel
a
vague
,
sweet
gladness
,
*NL*
and
he
was
aware
of
wild
yearnings
and
stirrings
for
he
knew
not
what
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
pursued
the
call
into
the
forest
,
looking
for
it
as
though
*NL*
it
were
a
tangible
thing
,
barking
softly
or
defiantly
,
as
the
mood
might
*NL*
dictate
.
He
would
thrust
his
nose
into
the
cool
wood
moss
,
or
into
the
*NL*
black
soil
where
long
grasses
grew
,
and
snort
with
joy
at
the
fat
earth
*NL*
smells
;
or
he
would
crouch
for
hours
,
as
if
in
concealment
,
behind
*NL*
fungus-covered
trunks
of
fallen
trees
,
wide-eyed
and
wide-eared
to
all
*NL*
that
moved
and
sounded
about
him
.
It
might
be
,
lying
thus
,
that
he
hoped
*NL*
to
surprise
this
call
he
could
not
understand
.
But
he
did
not
know
why
*NL*
he
did
these
various
things
.
He
was
impelled
to
do
them
,
and
did
not
*NL*
reason
about
them
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Irresistible
impulses
seized
him
.
He
would
be
lying
in
camp
,
dozing
*NL*
lazily
in
the
heat
of
the
day
,
when
suddenly
his
head
would
lift
and
his
*NL*
ears
cock
up
,
intent
and
listening
,
and
he
would
spring
to
his
feet
*NL*
and
dash
away
,
and
on
and
on
,
for
hours
,
through
the
forest
aisles
and
*NL*
across
the
open
spaces
where
the
niggerheads
bunched
.
He
loved
to
run
*NL*
down
dry
watercourses
,
and
to
creep
and
spy
upon
the
bird
life
in
the
*NL*
woods
.
For
a
day
at
a
time
he
would
lie
in
the
underbrush
where
he
could
*NL*
watch
the
partridges
drumming
and
strutting
up
and
down
.
But
especially
*NL*
he
loved
to
run
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
summer
midnights
,
listening
*NL*
to
the
subdued
and
sleepy
murmurs
of
the
forest
,
reading
signs
and
*NL*
sounds
as
man
may
read
a
book
,
and
seeking
for
the
mysterious
something
*NL*
that
called
--
called
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
at
all
times
,
for
him
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
he
sprang
from
sleep
with
a
start
,
eager-eyed
,
nostrils
*NL*
quivering
and
scenting
,
his
mane
bristling
in
recurrent
waves
.
From
the
*NL*
forest
came
the
call
-LRB-
or
one
note
of
it
,
for
the
call
was
many
noted
-RRB-
,
*NL*
distinct
and
definite
as
never
before
,
--
a
long-drawn
howl
,
like
,
yet
*NL*
unlike
,
any
noise
made
by
husky
dog
.
And
he
knew
it
,
in
the
old
familiar
*NL*
way
,
as
a
sound
heard
before
.
He
sprang
through
the
sleeping
camp
and
in
*NL*
swift
silence
dashed
through
the
woods
.
As
he
drew
closer
to
the
cry
*NL*
he
went
more
slowly
,
with
caution
in
every
movement
,
till
he
came
to
an
*NL*
open
place
among
the
trees
,
and
looking
out
saw
,
erect
on
haunches
,
with
*NL*
nose
pointed
to
the
sky
,
a
long
,
lean
,
timber
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
made
no
noise
,
yet
it
ceased
from
its
howling
and
tried
to
sense
*NL*
his
presence
.
Buck
stalked
into
the
open
,
half
crouching
,
body
gathered
*NL*
compactly
together
,
tail
straight
and
stiff
,
feet
falling
with
unwonted
*NL*
care
.
Every
movement
advertised
commingled
threatening
and
overture
of
*NL*
friendliness
.
It
was
the
menacing
truce
that
marks
the
meeting
of
wild
*NL*
beasts
that
prey
.
But
the
wolf
fled
at
sight
of
him
.
He
followed
,
with
*NL*
wild
leapings
,
in
a
frenzy
to
overtake
.
He
ran
him
into
a
blind
channel
,
*NL*
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
where
a
timber
jam
barred
the
way
.
The
wolf
*NL*
whirled
about
,
pivoting
on
his
hind
legs
after
the
fashion
of
Joe
and
*NL*
of
all
cornered
husky
dogs
,
snarling
and
bristling
,
clipping
his
teeth
*NL*
together
in
a
continuous
and
rapid
succession
of
snaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
did
not
attack
,
but
circled
him
about
and
hedged
him
in
with
*NL*
friendly
advances
.
The
wolf
was
suspicious
and
afraid
;
for
Buck
made
*NL*
three
of
him
in
weight
,
while
his
head
barely
reached
Buck
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
Watching
his
chance
,
he
darted
away
,
and
the
chase
was
resumed
.
Time
*NL*
and
again
he
was
cornered
,
and
the
thing
repeated
,
though
he
was
in
poor
*NL*
condition
,
or
Buck
could
not
so
easily
have
overtaken
him
.
He
would
run
*NL*
till
Buck
's
head
was
even
with
his
flank
,
when
he
would
whirl
around
at
*NL*
bay
,
only
to
dash
away
again
at
the
first
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
end
Buck
's
pertinacity
was
rewarded
;
for
the
wolf
,
finding
*NL*
that
no
harm
was
intended
,
finally
sniffed
noses
with
him
.
Then
they
*NL*
became
friendly
,
and
played
about
in
the
nervous
,
half-coy
way
with
*NL*
which
fierce
beasts
belie
their
fierceness
.
After
some
time
of
this
the
*NL*
wolf
started
off
at
an
easy
lope
in
a
manner
that
plainly
showed
he
was
*NL*
going
somewhere
.
He
made
it
clear
to
Buck
that
he
was
to
come
,
and
they
*NL*
ran
side
by
side
through
the
sombre
twilight
,
straight
up
the
creek
bed
,
*NL*
into
the
gorge
from
which
it
issued
,
and
across
the
bleak
divide
where
*NL*
it
took
its
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
opposite
slope
of
the
watershed
they
came
down
into
a
level
*NL*
country
where
were
great
stretches
of
forest
and
many
streams
,
and
*NL*
through
these
great
stretches
they
ran
steadily
,
hour
after
hour
,
the
*NL*
sun
rising
higher
and
the
day
growing
warmer
.
Buck
was
wildly
glad
.
He
*NL*
knew
he
was
at
last
answering
the
call
,
running
by
the
side
of
his
wood
*NL*
brother
toward
the
place
from
where
the
call
surely
came
.
Old
memories
*NL*
were
coming
upon
him
fast
,
and
he
was
stirring
to
them
as
of
old
he
*NL*
stirred
to
the
realities
of
which
they
were
the
shadows
.
He
had
done
*NL*
this
thing
before
,
somewhere
in
that
other
and
dimly
remembered
world
,
*NL*
and
he
was
doing
it
again
,
now
,
running
free
in
the
open
,
the
unpacked
*NL*
earth
underfoot
,
the
wide
sky
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
by
a
running
stream
to
drink
,
and
,
stopping
,
Buck
*NL*
remembered
John
Thornton
.
He
sat
down
.
The
wolf
started
on
toward
the
*NL*
place
from
where
the
call
surely
came
,
then
returned
to
him
,
sniffing
*NL*
noses
and
making
actions
as
though
to
encourage
him
.
But
Buck
turned
*NL*
about
and
started
slowly
on
the
back
track
.
For
the
better
part
of
an
*NL*
hour
the
wild
brother
ran
by
his
side
,
whining
softly
.
Then
he
sat
down
,
*NL*
pointed
his
nose
upward
,
and
howled
.
It
was
a
mournful
howl
,
and
as
Buck
*NL*
held
steadily
on
his
way
he
heard
it
grow
faint
and
fainter
until
it
was
*NL*
lost
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thornton
was
eating
dinner
when
Buck
dashed
into
camp
and
sprang
*NL*
upon
him
in
a
frenzy
of
affection
,
overturning
him
,
scrambling
upon
him
,
*NL*
licking
his
face
,
biting
his
hand
--
``
playing
the
general
tom-fool
,
''
as
*NL*
John
Thornton
characterized
it
,
the
while
he
shook
Buck
back
and
forth
*NL*
and
cursed
him
lovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
days
and
nights
Buck
never
left
camp
,
never
let
Thornton
out
of
*NL*
his
sight
.
He
followed
him
about
at
his
work
,
watched
him
while
he
ate
,
*NL*
saw
him
into
his
blankets
at
night
and
out
of
them
in
the
morning
.
But
*NL*
after
two
days
the
call
in
the
forest
began
to
sound
more
imperiously
*NL*
than
ever
.
Buck
's
restlessness
came
back
on
him
,
and
he
was
haunted
by
*NL*
recollections
of
the
wild
brother
,
and
of
the
smiling
land
beyond
the
*NL*
divide
and
the
run
side
by
side
through
the
wide
forest
stretches
.
Once
*NL*
again
he
took
to
wandering
in
the
woods
,
but
the
wild
brother
came
no
*NL*
more
;
and
though
he
listened
through
long
vigils
,
the
mournful
howl
was
*NL*
never
raised
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
sleep
out
at
night
,
staying
away
from
camp
for
days
at
a
*NL*
time
;
and
once
he
crossed
the
divide
at
the
head
of
the
creek
and
went
*NL*
down
into
the
land
of
timber
and
streams
.
There
he
wandered
for
a
week
,
*NL*
seeking
vainly
for
fresh
sign
of
the
wild
brother
,
killing
his
meat
as
*NL*
he
travelled
and
travelling
with
the
long
,
easy
lope
that
seems
never
to
*NL*
tire
.
He
fished
for
salmon
in
a
broad
stream
that
emptied
somewhere
into
*NL*
the
sea
,
and
by
this
stream
he
killed
a
large
black
bear
,
blinded
by
*NL*
the
mosquitoes
while
likewise
fishing
,
and
raging
through
the
forest
*NL*
helpless
and
terrible
.
Even
so
,
it
was
a
hard
fight
,
and
it
aroused
the
*NL*
last
latent
remnants
of
Buck
's
ferocity
.
And
two
days
later
,
when
he
*NL*
returned
to
his
kill
and
found
a
dozen
wolverenes
quarrelling
over
the
*NL*
spoil
,
he
scattered
them
like
chaff
;
and
those
that
fled
left
two
behind
*NL*
who
would
quarrel
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood-longing
became
stronger
than
ever
before
.
He
was
a
killer
,
a
*NL*
thing
that
preyed
,
living
on
the
things
that
lived
,
unaided
,
alone
,
*NL*
by
virtue
of
his
own
strength
and
prowess
,
surviving
triumphantly
in
a
*NL*
hostile
environment
where
only
the
strong
survived
.
Because
of
all
this
*NL*
he
became
possessed
of
a
great
pride
in
himself
,
which
communicated
*NL*
itself
like
a
contagion
to
his
physical
being
.
It
advertised
itself
*NL*
in
all
his
movements
,
was
apparent
in
the
play
of
every
muscle
,
spoke
*NL*
plainly
as
speech
in
the
way
he
carried
himself
,
and
made
his
glorious
*NL*
furry
coat
if
anything
more
glorious
.
But
for
the
stray
brown
on
his
*NL*
muzzle
and
above
his
eyes
,
and
for
the
splash
of
white
hair
that
ran
*NL*
midmost
down
his
chest
,
he
might
well
have
been
mistaken
for
a
gigantic
*NL*
wolf
,
larger
than
the
largest
of
the
breed
.
From
his
St.
Bernard
father
*NL*
he
had
inherited
size
and
weight
,
but
it
was
his
shepherd
mother
who
*NL*
had
given
shape
to
that
size
and
weight
.
His
muzzle
was
the
long
wolf
*NL*
muzzle
,
save
that
it
was
larger
than
the
muzzle
of
any
wolf
;
and
his
head
,
*NL*
somewhat
broader
,
was
the
wolf
head
on
a
massive
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
cunning
was
wolf
cunning
,
and
wild
cunning
;
his
intelligence
,
*NL*
shepherd
intelligence
and
St.
Bernard
intelligence
;
and
all
this
,
plus
*NL*
an
experience
gained
in
the
fiercest
of
schools
,
made
him
as
formidable
*NL*
a
creature
as
any
that
roamed
the
wild
.
A
carnivorous
*NL*
animal
living
on
a
straight
meat
diet
,
he
was
in
full
flower
,
at
the
*NL*
high
tide
of
his
life
,
overspilling
with
vigor
and
virility
.
When
*NL*
Thornton
passed
a
caressing
hand
along
his
back
,
a
snapping
and
*NL*
crackling
followed
the
hand
,
each
hair
discharging
its
pent
magnetism
*NL*
at
the
contact
.
Every
part
,
brain
and
body
,
nerve
tissue
and
fibre
,
was
*NL*
keyed
to
the
most
exquisite
pitch
;
and
between
all
the
parts
there
was
a
*NL*
perfect
equilibrium
or
adjustment
.
To
sights
and
sounds
and
events
which
*NL*
required
action
,
he
responded
with
lightning-like
rapidity
.
Quickly
as
*NL*
a
husky
dog
could
leap
to
defend
from
attack
or
to
attack
,
he
could
leap
*NL*
twice
as
quickly
.
He
saw
the
movement
,
or
heard
sound
,
and
responded
*NL*
in
less
time
than
another
dog
required
to
compass
the
mere
seeing
or
*NL*
hearing
.
He
perceived
and
determined
and
responded
in
the
same
instant
.
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
the
three
actions
of
perceiving
,
determining
,
and
*NL*
responding
were
sequential
;
but
so
infinitesimal
were
the
intervals
*NL*
of
time
between
them
that
they
appeared
simultaneous
.
His
muscles
were
*NL*
surcharged
with
vitality
,
and
snapped
into
play
sharply
,
like
steel
*NL*
springs
.
Life
streamed
through
him
in
splendid
flood
,
glad
and
rampant
,
*NL*
until
it
seemed
that
it
would
burst
him
asunder
in
sheer
ecstasy
and
*NL*
pour
forth
generously
over
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
was
there
such
a
dog
,
''
said
John
Thornton
one
day
,
as
the
*NL*
partners
watched
Buck
marching
out
of
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
was
made
,
the
mould
was
broke
,
''
said
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Py
jingo
!
I
t
`
ink
so
mineself
,
''
Hans
affirmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
him
marching
out
of
camp
,
but
they
did
not
see
the
instant
and
*NL*
terrible
transformation
which
took
place
as
soon
as
he
was
within
the
*NL*
secrecy
of
the
forest
.
He
no
longer
marched
.
At
once
he
became
a
thing
*NL*
of
the
wild
,
stealing
along
softly
,
cat-footed
,
a
passing
shadow
*NL*
that
appeared
and
disappeared
among
the
shadows
.
He
knew
how
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
every
cover
,
to
crawl
on
his
belly
like
a
snake
,
and
like
a
*NL*
snake
to
leap
and
strike
.
He
could
take
a
ptarmigan
from
its
nest
,
kill
*NL*
a
rabbit
as
it
slept
,
and
snap
in
mid
air
the
little
chipmunks
fleeing
*NL*
a
second
too
late
for
the
trees
.
Fish
,
in
open
pools
,
were
not
too
quick
*NL*
for
him
;
nor
were
beaver
,
mending
their
dams
,
too
wary
.
He
killed
*NL*
to
eat
,
not
from
wantonness
;
but
he
preferred
to
eat
what
he
killed
*NL*
himself
.
So
a
lurking
humor
ran
through
his
deeds
,
and
it
was
his
*NL*
delight
to
steal
upon
the
squirrels
,
and
,
when
he
all
but
had
them
,
to
*NL*
let
them
go
,
chattering
in
mortal
fear
to
the
treetops
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
fall
of
the
year
came
on
,
the
moose
appeared
in
greater
*NL*
abundance
,
moving
slowly
down
to
meet
the
winter
in
the
lower
and
less
*NL*
rigorous
valleys
.
Buck
had
already
dragged
down
a
stray
part-grown
calf
;
*NL*
but
he
wished
strongly
for
larger
and
more
formidable
quarry
,
and
he
*NL*
came
upon
it
one
day
on
the
divide
at
the
head
of
the
creek
.
A
band
of
*NL*
twenty
moose
had
crossed
over
from
the
land
of
streams
and
timber
,
*NL*
and
chief
among
them
was
a
great
bull
.
He
was
in
a
savage
temper
,
and
,
*NL*
standing
over
six
feet
from
the
ground
,
was
as
formidable
an
antagonist
*NL*
as
even
Buck
could
desire
.
Back
and
forth
the
bull
tossed
his
great
*NL*
palmated
antlers
,
branching
to
fourteen
points
and
embracing
seven
feet
*NL*
within
the
tips
.
His
small
eyes
burned
with
a
vicious
and
bitter
light
,
*NL*
while
he
roared
with
fury
at
sight
of
Buck
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
bull
's
side
,
just
forward
of
the
flank
,
protruded
a
feathered
*NL*
arrow-end
,
which
accounted
for
his
savageness
.
Guided
by
that
instinct
*NL*
which
came
from
the
old
hunting
days
of
the
primordial
world
,
Buck
*NL*
proceeded
to
cut
the
bull
out
from
the
herd
.
It
was
no
slight
task
.
He
*NL*
would
bark
and
dance
about
in
front
of
the
bull
,
just
out
of
reach
*NL*
of
the
great
antlers
and
of
the
terrible
splay
hoofs
which
could
have
*NL*
stamped
his
life
out
with
a
single
blow
.
Unable
to
turn
his
back
on
*NL*
the
fanged
danger
and
go
on
,
the
bull
would
be
driven
into
paroxysms
of
*NL*
rage
.
At
such
moments
he
charged
Buck
,
who
retreated
craftily
,
luring
*NL*
him
on
by
a
simulated
inability
to
escape
.
But
when
he
was
thus
*NL*
separated
from
his
fellows
,
two
or
three
of
the
younger
bulls
would
*NL*
charge
back
upon
Buck
and
enable
the
wounded
bull
to
rejoin
the
herd
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
patience
of
the
wild
--
dogged
,
tireless
,
persistent
as
life
*NL*
itself
--
that
holds
motionless
for
endless
hours
the
spider
in
its
web
,
*NL*
the
snake
in
its
coils
,
the
panther
in
its
ambuscade
;
this
patience
*NL*
belongs
peculiarly
to
life
when
it
hunts
its
living
food
;
and
it
*NL*
belonged
to
Buck
as
he
clung
to
the
flank
of
the
herd
,
retarding
*NL*
its
march
,
irritating
the
young
bulls
,
worrying
the
cows
with
their
*NL*
half-grown
calves
,
and
driving
the
wounded
bull
mad
with
helpless
rage
.
*NL*
For
half
a
day
this
continued
.
Buck
multiplied
himself
,
attacking
from
*NL*
all
sides
,
enveloping
the
herd
in
a
whirlwind
of
menace
,
cutting
out
his
*NL*
victim
as
fast
as
it
could
rejoin
its
mates
,
wearing
out
the
patience
of
*NL*
creatures
preyed
upon
,
which
is
a
lesser
patience
than
that
of
creatures
*NL*
preying
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
day
wore
along
and
the
sun
dropped
to
its
bed
in
the
northwest
*NL*
-LRB-
the
darkness
had
come
back
and
the
fall
nights
were
six
hours
long
-RRB-
,
*NL*
the
young
bulls
retraced
their
steps
more
and
more
reluctantly
to
the
*NL*
aid
of
their
beset
leader
.
The
down-coming
winter
was
harrying
them
*NL*
on
to
the
lower
levels
,
and
it
seemed
they
could
never
shake
off
this
*NL*
tireless
creature
that
held
them
back
.
Besides
,
it
was
not
the
life
of
*NL*
the
herd
,
or
of
the
young
bulls
,
that
was
threatened
.
The
life
of
only
*NL*
one
member
was
demanded
,
which
was
a
remoter
interest
than
their
lives
,
*NL*
and
in
the
end
they
were
content
to
pay
the
toll
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
twilight
fell
the
old
bull
stood
with
lowered
head
,
watching
his
*NL*
mates
--
the
cows
he
had
known
,
the
calves
he
had
fathered
,
the
bulls
he
*NL*
had
mastered
--
as
they
shambled
on
at
a
rapid
pace
through
the
fading
*NL*
light
.
He
could
not
follow
,
for
before
his
nose
leaped
the
merciless
*NL*
fanged
terror
that
would
not
let
him
go
.
Three
hundredweight
more
than
*NL*
half
a
ton
he
weighed
;
he
had
lived
a
long
,
strong
life
,
full
of
fight
*NL*
and
struggle
,
and
at
the
end
he
faced
death
at
the
teeth
of
a
creature
*NL*
whose
head
did
not
reach
beyond
his
great
knuckled
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
then
on
,
night
and
day
,
Buck
never
left
his
prey
,
never
gave
it
a
*NL*
moment
's
rest
,
never
permitted
it
to
browse
the
leaves
of
trees
or
*NL*
the
shoots
of
young
birch
and
willow
.
Nor
did
he
give
the
wounded
bull
*NL*
opportunity
to
slake
his
burning
thirst
in
the
slender
trickling
streams
*NL*
they
crossed
.
Often
,
in
desperation
,
he
burst
into
long
stretches
of
*NL*
flight
.
At
such
times
Buck
did
not
attempt
to
stay
him
,
but
loped
easily
*NL*
at
his
heels
,
satisfied
with
the
way
the
game
was
played
,
lying
down
*NL*
when
the
moose
stood
still
,
attacking
him
fiercely
when
he
strove
to
eat
*NL*
or
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
head
drooped
more
and
more
under
its
tree
of
horns
,
and
*NL*
the
shambling
trot
grew
weak
and
weaker
.
He
took
to
standing
for
long
*NL*
periods
,
with
nose
to
the
ground
and
dejected
ears
dropped
limply
;
and
*NL*
Buck
found
more
time
in
which
to
get
water
for
himself
and
in
which
to
*NL*
rest
.
At
such
moments
,
panting
with
red
lolling
tongue
and
with
eyes
*NL*
fixed
upon
the
big
bull
,
it
appeared
to
Buck
that
a
change
was
coming
*NL*
over
the
face
of
things
.
He
could
feel
a
new
stir
in
the
land
.
As
the
*NL*
moose
were
coming
into
the
land
,
other
kinds
of
life
were
coming
in
.
*NL*
Forest
and
stream
and
air
seemed
palpitant
with
their
presence
.
The
news
*NL*
of
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
,
not
by
sight
,
or
sound
,
or
smell
,
but
by
*NL*
some
other
and
subtler
sense
.
He
heard
nothing
,
saw
nothing
,
yet
knew
*NL*
that
the
land
was
somehow
different
;
that
through
it
strange
things
were
*NL*
afoot
and
ranging
;
and
he
resolved
to
investigate
after
he
had
finished
*NL*
the
business
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
,
he
pulled
the
great
moose
down
.
*NL*
For
a
day
and
a
night
he
remained
by
the
kill
,
eating
and
sleeping
,
turn
*NL*
and
turn
about
.
Then
,
rested
,
refreshed
and
strong
,
he
turned
his
face
*NL*
toward
camp
and
John
Thornton
.
He
broke
into
the
long
easy
lope
,
and
*NL*
went
on
,
hour
after
hour
,
never
at
loss
for
the
tangled
way
,
heading
*NL*
straight
home
through
strange
country
with
a
certitude
of
direction
that
*NL*
put
man
and
his
magnetic
needle
to
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
held
on
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
new
stir
in
the
*NL*
land
.
There
was
life
abroad
in
it
different
from
the
life
which
had
been
*NL*
there
throughout
the
summer
.
No
longer
was
this
fact
borne
in
upon
him
*NL*
in
some
subtle
,
mysterious
way
.
The
birds
talked
of
it
,
the
squirrels
*NL*
chattered
about
it
,
the
very
breeze
whispered
of
it
.
Several
times
he
*NL*
stopped
and
drew
in
the
fresh
morning
air
in
great
sniffs
,
reading
a
*NL*
message
which
made
him
leap
on
with
greater
speed
.
He
was
oppressed
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
calamity
happening
,
if
it
were
not
calamity
already
happened
;
*NL*
and
as
he
crossed
the
last
watershed
and
dropped
down
into
the
valley
*NL*
toward
camp
,
he
proceeded
with
greater
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
miles
away
he
came
upon
a
fresh
trail
that
sent
his
neck
hair
*NL*
rippling
and
bristling
,
It
led
straight
toward
camp
and
John
Thornton
.
*NL*
Buck
hurried
on
,
swiftly
and
stealthily
,
every
nerve
straining
and
*NL*
tense
,
alert
to
the
multitudinous
details
which
told
a
story
--
all
but
*NL*
the
end
.
His
nose
gave
him
a
varying
description
of
the
passage
of
the
*NL*
life
on
the
heels
of
which
he
was
travelling
.
He
remarked
the
pregnant
*NL*
silence
of
the
forest
.
The
bird
life
had
flitted
.
The
squirrels
were
in
*NL*
hiding
.
One
only
he
saw
,
--
a
sleek
gray
fellow
,
flattened
against
a
gray
*NL*
dead
limb
so
that
he
seemed
a
part
of
it
,
a
woody
excrescence
upon
the
*NL*
wood
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Buck
slid
along
with
the
obscureness
of
a
gliding
shadow
,
his
nose
*NL*
was
jerked
suddenly
to
the
side
as
though
a
positive
force
had
gripped
*NL*
and
pulled
it
.
He
followed
the
new
scent
into
a
thicket
and
found
Nig
.
*NL*
He
was
lying
on
his
side
,
dead
where
he
had
dragged
himself
,
an
arrow
*NL*
protruding
,
head
and
feathers
,
from
either
side
of
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hundred
yards
farther
on
,
Buck
came
upon
one
of
the
sled-dogs
Thornton
*NL*
had
bought
in
Dawson
.
This
dog
was
thrashing
about
in
a
death-struggle
,
*NL*
directly
on
the
trail
,
and
Buck
passed
around
him
without
stopping
.
From
*NL*
the
camp
came
the
faint
sound
of
many
voices
,
rising
and
falling
in
a
*NL*
sing-song
chant
.
Bellying
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
,
he
found
*NL*
Hans
,
lying
on
his
face
,
feathered
with
arrows
like
a
porcupine
.
At
the
*NL*
same
instant
Buck
peered
out
where
the
spruce-bough
lodge
had
been
and
*NL*
saw
what
made
his
hair
leap
straight
up
on
his
neck
and
shoulders
.
*NL*
A
gust
of
overpowering
rage
swept
over
him
.
He
did
not
know
that
he
*NL*
growled
,
but
he
growled
aloud
with
a
terrible
ferocity
.
For
the
last
*NL*
time
in
his
life
he
allowed
passion
to
usurp
cunning
and
reason
,
and
it
*NL*
was
because
of
his
great
love
for
John
Thornton
that
he
lost
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Yeehats
were
dancing
about
the
wreckage
of
the
spruce-bough
lodge
*NL*
when
they
heard
a
fearful
roaring
and
saw
rushing
upon
them
an
animal
*NL*
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before
.
It
was
Buck
,
a
live
*NL*
hurricane
of
fury
,
hurling
himself
upon
them
in
a
frenzy
to
destroy
.
He
*NL*
sprang
at
the
foremost
man
-LRB-
it
was
the
chief
of
the
Yeehats
-RRB-
,
ripping
*NL*
the
throat
wide
open
till
the
rent
jugular
spouted
a
fountain
of
blood
.
*NL*
He
did
not
pause
to
worry
the
victim
,
but
ripped
in
passing
,
with
*NL*
the
next
bound
tearing
wide
the
throat
of
a
second
man
.
There
was
*NL*
no
withstanding
him
.
He
plunged
about
in
their
very
midst
,
tearing
,
*NL*
rending
,
destroying
,
in
constant
and
terrific
motion
which
defied
the
*NL*
arrows
they
discharged
at
him
.
In
fact
,
so
inconceivably
rapid
were
his
*NL*
movements
,
and
so
closely
were
the
Indians
tangled
together
,
that
they
*NL*
shot
one
another
with
the
arrows
;
and
one
young
hunter
,
hurling
a
spear
*NL*
at
Buck
in
mid
air
,
drove
it
through
the
chest
of
another
hunter
with
*NL*
such
force
that
the
point
broke
through
the
skin
of
the
back
and
stood
*NL*
out
beyond
.
Then
a
panic
seized
the
Yeehats
,
and
they
fled
in
terror
to
*NL*
the
woods
,
proclaiming
as
they
fled
the
advent
of
the
Evil
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
truly
Buck
was
the
Fiend
incarnate
,
raging
at
their
heels
and
*NL*
dragging
them
down
like
deer
as
they
raced
through
the
trees
.
It
was
*NL*
a
fateful
day
for
the
Yeehats
.
They
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
*NL*
country
,
and
it
was
not
till
a
week
later
that
the
last
of
the
survivors
*NL*
gathered
together
in
a
lower
valley
and
counted
their
losses
.
As
for
*NL*
Buck
,
wearying
of
the
pursuit
,
he
returned
to
the
desolated
camp
.
He
*NL*
found
Pete
where
he
had
been
killed
in
his
blankets
in
the
first
moment
*NL*
of
surprise
.
Thornton
's
desperate
struggle
was
fresh-written
on
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
Buck
scented
every
detail
of
it
down
to
the
edge
of
a
deep
*NL*
pool
.
By
the
edge
,
head
and
fore
feet
in
the
water
,
lay
Skeet
,
faithful
*NL*
to
the
last
.
The
pool
itself
,
muddy
and
discolored
from
the
sluice
*NL*
boxes
,
effectually
hid
what
it
contained
,
and
it
contained
John
*NL*
Thornton
;
for
Buck
followed
his
trace
into
the
water
,
from
which
no
*NL*
trace
led
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
Buck
brooded
by
the
pool
or
roamed
restlessly
about
the
camp
.
*NL*
Death
,
as
a
cessation
of
movement
,
as
a
passing
out
and
away
from
the
*NL*
lives
of
the
living
,
he
knew
,
and
he
knew
John
Thornton
was
dead
.
It
*NL*
left
a
great
void
in
him
,
somewhat
akin
to
hunger
,
but
a
void
which
*NL*
ached
and
ached
,
and
which
food
could
not
fill
,
At
times
,
when
he
paused
*NL*
to
contemplate
the
carcasses
of
the
Yeehats
,
he
forgot
the
pain
of
it
;
*NL*
and
at
such
times
he
was
aware
of
a
great
pride
in
himself
,
--
a
pride
*NL*
greater
than
any
he
had
yet
experienced
.
He
had
killed
man
,
the
noblest
*NL*
game
of
all
,
and
he
had
killed
in
the
face
of
the
law
of
club
and
fang
.
*NL*
He
sniffed
the
bodies
curiously
.
They
had
died
so
easily
.
It
was
harder
*NL*
to
kill
a
husky
dog
than
them
.
They
were
no
match
at
all
,
were
it
*NL*
not
for
their
arrows
and
spears
and
clubs
.
Thenceforward
he
would
be
*NL*
unafraid
of
them
except
when
they
bore
in
their
hands
their
arrows
,
*NL*
spears
,
and
clubs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
came
on
,
and
a
full
moon
rose
high
over
the
trees
into
the
sky
,
*NL*
lighting
the
land
till
it
lay
bathed
in
ghostly
day
.
And
with
the
coming
*NL*
of
the
night
,
brooding
and
mourning
by
the
pool
,
Buck
became
alive
to
a
*NL*
stirring
of
the
new
life
in
the
forest
other
than
that
which
the
Yeehats
*NL*
had
made
,
He
stood
up
,
listening
and
scenting
.
From
far
away
drifted
a
*NL*
faint
,
sharp
yelp
,
followed
by
a
chorus
of
similar
sharp
yelps
.
As
the
*NL*
moments
passed
the
yelps
grew
closer
and
louder
.
Again
Buck
knew
them
*NL*
as
things
heard
in
that
other
world
which
persisted
in
his
memory
.
He
*NL*
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
open
space
and
listened
.
It
was
the
call
,
*NL*
the
many-noted
call
,
sounding
more
luringly
and
compellingly
than
ever
*NL*
before
.
And
as
never
before
,
he
was
ready
to
obey
.
John
Thornton
was
*NL*
dead
.
The
last
tie
was
broken
.
Man
and
the
claims
of
man
no
longer
bound
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hunting
their
living
meat
,
as
the
Yeehats
were
hunting
it
,
on
the
flanks
*NL*
of
the
migrating
moose
,
the
wolf
pack
had
at
last
crossed
over
from
the
*NL*
land
of
streams
and
timber
and
invaded
Buck
's
valley
.
Into
the
clearing
*NL*
where
the
moonlight
streamed
,
they
poured
in
a
silvery
flood
;
and
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
clearing
stood
Buck
,
motionless
as
a
statue
,
waiting
their
*NL*
coming
.
They
were
awed
,
so
still
and
large
he
stood
,
and
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
fell
,
till
the
boldest
one
leaped
straight
for
him
.
Like
a
flash
*NL*
Buck
struck
,
breaking
the
neck
.
Then
he
stood
,
without
movement
,
as
*NL*
before
,
the
stricken
wolf
rolling
in
agony
behind
him
.
Three
others
*NL*
tried
it
in
sharp
succession
;
and
one
after
the
other
they
drew
back
,
*NL*
streaming
blood
from
slashed
throats
or
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
sufficient
to
fling
the
whole
pack
forward
,
pell-mell
,
crowded
*NL*
together
,
blocked
and
confused
by
its
eagerness
to
pull
down
the
*NL*
prey
.
Buck
's
marvellous
quickness
and
agility
stood
him
in
good
stead
.
*NL*
Pivoting
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
snapping
and
gashing
,
he
was
everywhere
*NL*
at
once
,
presenting
a
front
which
was
apparently
unbroken
so
swiftly
did
*NL*
he
whirl
and
guard
from
side
to
side
.
But
to
prevent
them
from
getting
*NL*
behind
him
,
he
was
forced
back
,
down
past
the
pool
and
into
the
creek
*NL*
bed
,
till
he
brought
up
against
a
high
gravel
bank
.
He
worked
along
to
a
*NL*
right
angle
in
the
bank
which
the
men
had
made
in
the
course
of
mining
,
*NL*
and
in
this
angle
he
came
to
bay
,
protected
on
three
sides
and
with
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
face
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
well
did
he
face
it
,
that
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
wolves
*NL*
drew
back
discomfited
.
The
tongues
of
all
were
out
and
lolling
,
the
*NL*
white
fangs
showing
cruelly
white
in
the
moonlight
.
Some
were
lying
down
*NL*
with
heads
raised
and
ears
pricked
forward
;
others
stood
on
their
feet
,
*NL*
watching
him
;
and
still
others
were
lapping
water
from
the
pool
.
One
*NL*
wolf
,
long
and
lean
and
gray
,
advanced
cautiously
,
in
a
friendly
manner
,
*NL*
and
Buck
recognized
the
wild
brother
with
whom
he
had
run
for
a
night
*NL*
and
a
day
.
He
was
whining
softly
,
and
,
as
Buck
whined
,
they
touched
*NL*
noses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
an
old
wolf
,
gaunt
and
battle-scarred
,
came
forward
.
Buck
writhed
*NL*
his
lips
into
the
preliminary
of
a
snarl
,
but
sniffed
noses
with
him
,
*NL*
Whereupon
the
old
wolf
sat
down
,
pointed
nose
at
the
moon
,
and
broke
*NL*
out
the
long
wolf
howl
.
The
others
sat
down
and
howled
.
And
now
the
call
*NL*
came
to
Buck
in
unmistakable
accents
.
He
,
too
,
sat
down
and
howled
.
This
*NL*
over
,
he
came
out
of
his
angle
and
the
pack
crowded
around
him
,
sniffing
*NL*
in
half-friendly
,
half-savage
manner
.
The
leaders
lifted
the
yelp
of
the
*NL*
pack
and
sprang
away
into
the
woods
.
The
wolves
swung
in
behind
,
yelping
*NL*
in
chorus
.
And
Buck
ran
with
them
,
side
by
side
with
the
wild
brother
,
*NL*
yelping
as
he
ran
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
may
well
end
the
story
of
Buck
.
The
years
were
not
many
when
*NL*
the
Yeehats
noted
a
change
in
the
breed
of
timber
wolves
;
for
some
were
*NL*
seen
with
splashes
of
brown
on
head
and
muzzle
,
and
with
a
rift
of
white
*NL*
centring
down
the
chest
.
But
more
remarkable
than
this
,
the
Yeehats
tell
*NL*
of
a
Ghost
Dog
that
runs
at
the
head
of
the
pack
.
They
are
afraid
of
*NL*
this
Ghost
Dog
,
for
it
has
cunning
greater
than
they
,
stealing
from
*NL*
their
camps
in
fierce
winters
,
robbing
their
traps
,
slaying
their
dogs
,
*NL*
and
defying
their
bravest
hunters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nay
,
the
tale
grows
worse
.
Hunters
there
are
who
fail
to
return
to
*NL*
the
camp
,
and
hunters
there
have
been
whom
their
tribesmen
found
with
*NL*
throats
slashed
cruelly
open
and
with
wolf
prints
about
them
in
the
snow
*NL*
greater
than
the
prints
of
any
wolf
.
Each
fall
,
when
the
Yeehats
follow
*NL*
the
movement
of
the
moose
,
there
is
a
certain
valley
which
they
never
*NL*
enter
.
And
women
there
are
who
become
sad
when
the
word
goes
over
*NL*
the
fire
of
how
the
Evil
Spirit
came
to
select
that
valley
for
an
*NL*
abiding-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
summers
there
is
one
visitor
,
however
,
to
that
valley
,
of
which
*NL*
the
Yeehats
do
not
know
.
It
is
a
great
,
gloriously
coated
wolf
,
like
,
*NL*
and
yet
unlike
,
all
other
wolves
.
He
crosses
alone
from
the
smiling
*NL*
timber
land
and
comes
down
into
an
open
space
among
the
trees
.
Here
*NL*
a
yellow
stream
flows
from
rotted
moose-hide
sacks
and
sinks
into
*NL*
the
ground
,
with
long
grasses
growing
through
it
and
vegetable
mould
*NL*
overrunning
it
and
hiding
its
yellow
from
the
sun
;
and
here
he
muses
for
*NL*
a
time
,
howling
once
,
long
and
mournfully
,
ere
he
departs
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
is
not
always
alone
.
When
the
long
winter
nights
come
on
and
the
*NL*
wolves
follow
their
meat
into
the
lower
valleys
,
he
may
be
seen
running
*NL*
at
the
head
of
the
pack
through
the
pale
moonlight
or
glimmering
*NL*
borealis
,
leaping
gigantic
above
his
fellows
,
his
great
throat
a-bellow
*NL*
as
he
sings
a
song
of
the
younger
world
,
which
is
the
song
of
the
pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
