INTRODUCTION

§

THE
PRESENT
TEXT
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
text
of
the
`
Canterbury
Tales
,
'
as
printed
in
the
present
volume
,
is
an
*NL*
entirely
new
one
,
owing
nothing
to
the
numerous
printed
editions
which
have
*NL*
preceded
it
.
The
only
exceptions
to
this
statement
are
to
be
found
in
the
*NL*
case
of
such
portions
as
have
been
formerly
edited
,
for
the
Clarendon
*NL*
Press
,
by
Dr.
Morris
and
myself
.
The
reasons
for
the
necessity
of
a
*NL*
formation
of
an
absolutely
new
text
will
appear
on
a
perusal
of
the
text
*NL*
itself
,
as
compared
with
any
of
its
predecessors
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
it
owes
everything
to
the
labours
of
Dr.
Furnivall
for
*NL*
the
Chaucer
Society
,
but
for
which
no
satisfactory
results
could
have
been
*NL*
obtained
,
except
at
the
cost
of
more
time
and
toil
than
I
could
well
devote
*NL*
to
the
subject
.
In
other
words
,
my
work
is
entirely
founded
upon
the
*NL*
splendid
`
Six-text
'
Edition
published
by
that
Society
,
supplemented
by
the
*NL*
very
valuable
reprint
of
the
celebrated
`
Harleian
'
manuscript
in
the
same
*NL*
series
.
These
Seven
Texts
are
all
exact
reproductions
of
seven
important
*NL*
MSS.
,
and
are
,
in
two
respects
,
more
important
to
the
student
than
the
MSS
.
*NL*
themselves
;
that
is
to
say
,
they
can
be
studied
simultaneously
instead
of
*NL*
separately
,
and
they
can
be
consulted
and
re-consulted
at
any
moment
,
being
*NL*
always
accessible
.
The
importance
of
such
opportunities
is
obvious
.

The

list

all
the
MSS

By

called
`

'
A
MS
of
the
*NL*
B-type
-LRB-
see
below
-RRB-
.
Printed
in
full
for
the
Chaucer
Society
,
1885
.
Collated
*NL*
throughout
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
MS.
of
great
importance
,
but
difficult
to
understand
or
describe
.
For
*NL*
the
greater
clearness
,
I
shall
roughly
describe
the
MSS
.
as
being
of
*NL*
the
A-type
,
the
B-type
,
the
C-type
,
and
the
D-type
-LRB-
really
a
second
*NL*
C-type
-RRB-
.
Of
the
A-type
,
the
best
example
is
the
Ellesmere
MS.
;
of
the
*NL*
B-type
,
the
best
example
is
the
Harleian
MS.
7334
;
of
the
C-type
,
the
*NL*
Corpus
and
Lansdowne
MSS.
;
the
D-type
is
that
exhibited
by
Caxton
and
*NL*
Thynne
in
the
early
printed
editions
.
They
may
be
called
the
*NL*
`
Ellesmere
,
'
`
Harleian
,
'
`
Corpus
,
'
and
`
Caxton
'
types
respectively
.
*NL*
These
types
differ
as
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Tales
,
and
even
MSS
.
of
*NL*
a
similar
type
differ
slightly
,
in
this
respect
,
among
themselves
.
They
*NL*
also
frequently
differ
as
to
certain
characteristic
readings
,
although
*NL*
many
of
the
variations
of
reading
are
peculiar
to
one
or
two
MSS
.
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
MS.
Hl
.
contains
the
best
copy
of
the
Tale
of
Gamelyn
,
for
which
see
p.
*NL*
645
;
this
Tale
is
not
found
in
MSS
.
of
the
A-type
.
Moreover
,
Group
G
*NL*
here
precedes
Group
C
and
a
large
part
of
Group
B
,
whereas
in
the
*NL*
Ellesmere
MS.
it
follows
them
.
In
the
Monk
's
Tale
,
the
lines
numbered
B
*NL*
3565-3652
-LRB-
containing
the
Tales
called
the
`
modern
instances
'
-RRB-
*NL*
immediately
follow
B
3564
-LRB-
as
in
this
edition
-RRB-
,
whereas
in
the
*NL*
Ellesmere
MS.
these
lines
come
at
the
end
of
the
Tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
`
various
readings
'
of
this
MS.
are
often
peculiar
,
and
it
is
*NL*
difficult
to
appraise
them
.
I
take
them
to
be
of
two
kinds
:
-LRB-
i
-RRB-
*NL*
readings
which
are
better
than
those
of
the
Six-text
,
and
should
*NL*
certainly
be
preferred
,
such
as
_
halfe
_
in
A
8
,
_
cloysterlees
_
in
A
*NL*
179
,
_
a
_
-LRB-
not
_
a
ful
_
-RRB-
in
A
196
,
and
the
like
;
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
readings
due
to
*NL*
a
terrible
blundering
on
the
part
of
the
scribe
,
such
as
_
fleyng
_
for
*NL*
_
flikeringe
_
in
A
1962
,
_
greene
_
for
_
kene
_
in
A
1966
,
and
the
like
.
It
*NL*
is
,
in
fact
,
a
most
dangerous
MS.
to
trust
to
,
unless
constantly
*NL*
corrected
by
others
,
and
is
not
at
all
fitted
to
be
taken
as
the
*NL*
_
basis
_
of
a
text
.

remarks

*NL*
*NL*
As
regards
age
,
this
MS.
is
one
of
the
oldest
;
and
it
is
beautifully
*NL*
written
.
Its
chief
defect
is
the
loss
of
eight
leaves
,
so
that

the

many
necessary
notes

The
last
of
these
*NL*
adds
poor
texts
of
the
rest
of
Chaucer
's
Works
,
from
old
black-letter
*NL*
editions
,
with
which
Tyrwhitt
had
nothing
to
do
.
In
Tyrwhitt
's
text
,
the
*NL*
number
of
grammatical
errors
is
very
large
,
and
he
frequently
introduces
*NL*
words
into
the
text
without
authority
.
For
some
account
of
the
later
*NL*
editions
of
Chaucer
's
Works
,
see
the
Introduction
to
the
Legend
of
Good
*NL*
Women
,
in
vol
.
iii
.
I
may
note
,
by
the
way
,
that
the
editions
by
Wright
,
*NL*
Bell
,
and
Morris
are
all
founded
on
MS.
Harl
.
7334
,
a
very
unsafe
MS.
in
*NL*
some
respects
;
see
p.
viii
-LRB-
above
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
necessary
to
add
here
a
few
words
of
warning
.
Wright
's
edition
,
*NL*
though
it
has
many
merits
,
turns
out
,
in
practice
,
to
be
dangerously
*NL*
untrustworthy
.
He
frequently
inserts
words
,
borrowed
from
Tyrwhitt
's
*NL*
edition
-LRB-
which
he
heartily
condemns
as
being
full
of
errors
in
*NL*
grammar
-RRB-
,
without
the
least
indication
that
they
are
_
not
in
the
MS.
_
*NL*
This
becomes
the
more
serious
when
we
find
,
upon
examination
,
that
*NL*
Tyrwhitt
had
likewise
no
authority
for
some
of
such
insertions
,
but
*NL*
simply
introduced
them
,
by
guess
,
to
fill
up
a
line
in
a
way
that
*NL*
pleased
him
.
For
example
,
A
628
runs
thus
,
in
all
the
seven
MSS.
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
his
visage
children
were
aferd
.
'
It
is
quite
correct
;
for
`
viság-e
'
*NL*
is
trisyllabic
.
Tyrwhitt
did
not
know
this
,
and
counted
the
syllables
*NL*
as
_
two
_
only
,
neglecting
the
final
e
.
The
line
seemed
then
too
short
;
*NL*
so
he
inserted
_
sore
_
before
_
aferd
_
,
thus
ruining
the
scansion
.
Wright
*NL*
follows
suit
,
and
inserts
_
sore
_
,
though
it
is
not
in
his
MS.
;
giving
*NL*
no
notice
at
all
of
what
he
has
done
.
Bell
follows
suit
,
and
the
word
*NL*
is
even
preserved
in
Morris
;
but
the
latter
prints
the
word
in
italics
,
*NL*
to
shew
that
it
is
not
in
the
MS.
Nor
is
it
in
the
Six-text
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
not
adduce
more
instances
,
but
shall
content
myself
with
saying
*NL*
that
,
until
the
publications
of
the
Chaucer
Society
appeared
,
no
reader
*NL*
had
the
means
of
knowing
what
the
best
MS.
texts
were
really
like
.
All
*NL*
who
have
been
accustomed
to
former
-LRB-
complete
-RRB-
editions
have
necessarily
*NL*
imbibed
hundreds
of
false
impressions
,
and
have
necessarily
accepted
*NL*
numberless
theories
as
to
the
scansion
of
lines
which
they
will
,
in
*NL*
course
of
due
time
,
be
prepared
to
abandon
.
In
the
course
of
my
work
,
*NL*
it
has
been
made
clear
to
me
that
Chaucer
's
text
has
been
manipulated
*NL*
and
sophisticated
,
frequently
in
most
cunning
and
plausible
ways
,
to
a
*NL*
far
greater
extent
than
I
could
have
believed
to
be
possible
.
This
is
*NL*
not
a
pleasant
subject
,
and
I
only
mention
it
for
the
use
of
scholars
.
*NL*
Such
variations
fortunately
seldom
affect
the
sense
;
but
they
vitiate
*NL*
the
scansion
,
the
grammar
,
and
the
etymology
in
many
cases
.
Of
course
*NL*
it
will
be
understood
that
I
am
saying
no
more
than
I
can
fully
*NL*
substantiate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
absolutely
appalling
to
read
such
a
statement
as
the
following
in
*NL*
Bell
's
edition
,
vol
.
i.
p.
60
.
`
All
deviations
,
either
from
Mr.
*NL*
Wright
's
edition
,
or
from
the
original
MS.
,
are
pointed
out
in
the
*NL*
footnotes
for
the
ultimate
satisfaction
of
the
reader
.
'
For
the
*NL*
instances
in
which
this
is
really
done
are
very
rare
indeed
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
large
number
of
such
deviations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Tyrwhitt
's
text
,
it
is
sufficient
to
remark
that
it
was
hardly
*NL*
possible
,
at
-LSB-
xvii
-RSB-
that
date
,
for
a
better
text
to
have
been
produced
.
*NL*
The
rules
of
Middle
English
grammar
had
not
been
formulated
,
so
that
we
*NL*
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
he
constantly
makes
the
past
tense
of
a
*NL*
weak
verb
monosyllabic
,
when
it
should
be
dissyllabic
,
and
treats
the
*NL*
past
participle
as
dissyllabic
,
when
it
should
be
monosyllabic
:
which
*NL*
makes
wild
work
with
the
scansion
.
It
is
also
to
be
regretted
that
he
*NL*
based
his
text
upon
the
faulty
black-letter
editions
,
though
he
took
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
pains
in
collating
them
with
various
MSS
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
his
literary
notes
are
full
of
learning
and
*NL*
research
;
and
the
number
of
admirable
illustrations
by
which
he
has
*NL*
efficiently
elucidated
the
text
is
very
great
.
His
reputation
as
one
of
*NL*
the
foremost
of
our
literary
critics
is
thoroughly
established
,
and
*NL*
needs
no
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wright
's
notes
are
likewise
excellent
,
and
resulted
from
a
wide
*NL*
reading
.
I
have
also
found
some
most
useful
hints
in
the
notes
to
*NL*
Bell
's
edition
.
Of
all
such
sources
of
information
I
have
been
only
too
*NL*
glad
to
avail
myself
,
as
is
more
fully
shewn
in
the
succeeding
volume

represent

In
using
these
terms

`
earliest

'
&
c.
,
I
do
not
refer
to
the
age
of
the
*NL*
MSS.
,
but
to
the
type
of
text
which
they
exhibit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the

respectively

*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
MSS.
,
E.
is
the
best
in
nearly
every
respect
.
It
not
only
gives
*NL*
good
lines
and
good
sense
,
but
is
also
-LRB-
usually
-RRB-
grammatically
accurate
and
*NL*
thoroughly
well
spelt
.
The
publication
of
it
has
been
a
very
great
boon
to
*NL*
all
Chaucer
students
,
for
which
Dr.
Furnivall
will
be
ever
gratefully
*NL*
remembered
.
We
must
not
omit
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
recognise
the
liberality
*NL*
and
generosity
of
the
owner
of
the
MS.
,
who
so
freely
permitted
such
full
*NL*
use
of
it
to
be
made
;
the
same
remark
applies
,
equally
,
to
the
-LSB-
xviii
-RSB-
*NL*
owners
of
the
Hengwrt
and
the
Petworth
MSS
.
The
names
of
the
Earl
of
*NL*
Ellesmere
,
Mr.
Wm.
W.
E.
Wynne
of
Peniarth
,
and
Lord
Leconfield
have
*NL*
deservedly
become
as
`
familiar
as
household
words
'
to
many
a
student
of
*NL*
Chaucer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
splendid
MS.
has
also
the
great
merit
of
being
complete
,
requiring
no
*NL*
supplement
from
any
other
source
,
except
in
the
few
cases
where
a
line
or
*NL*
two
has
been
missed
.
For
example
,
it
does
not
contain
A

&

In
the
*NL*
Tale
of
Melibeus
,
the
French
original
shews
that
_
all
_
the
MSS
.
have
lost
B
*NL*
2252-3
,
2623-4
,
which
have
to
be
supplied
by
translation
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
seven
MSS
.
have
B
4637-4652
;
these
lines
are
genuine
,
but
were
*NL*
probably
meant
to
be
cancelled
.
They
only
occur
,
to
my
knowledge
,
in
four
*NL*
MSS.
,
nos.
7
,
11
,
25
,
and
29
;
though
found
also
in
the
old
black-letter
*NL*
editions
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
E.
preserves
lines
rarely
found
elsewhere
.
Such
are
A
*NL*
3155-6
,
3721-2
,
F
1455-6
,
1493-9
;
twelve
genuine
lines
,
none
of
which
are
*NL*
in
Tyrwhitt
,
and
only
the
first
two
are
in
Wright
.
Observe
also
the
stanza
*NL*
in
the
footnote
to
p.
424
;
with
which
compare
B
3083
,
on
p.

*NL*
*NL*
The
text
of
the
Ellesmere
MS.
has
only
been
corrected
in
cases
where
*NL*
careful
collation
suggests
a
desirable
improvement
.
Every
instance
of
this
*NL*
character
is
invariably
recorded
in
the
footnotes
.
Thus
,
in
A
8
,
the
*NL*
grammar
and
scansion
require
_
half-e
_
,
not
_
half
_
;
though
,
curiously
*NL*
enough
,
this
correct
form
appears
in
Hl
.
only
,
among
all
the
seven
MSS
.
In
*NL*
very
difficult
cases
,
other
MSS
.
-LRB-
besides
the
seven
-RRB-
have
been
collated
,
*NL*
but
I
have
seldom
gained
much
by
it
.
The
chief
additional

.
thus
used

are

,
for
the
Canon
's
Yeoman
's
Tale
;
*NL*
and
others
that
are
sufficiently
indicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
paid
especial
attention
to
the
suffixes
required
by
Middle-English
*NL*
grammar
,
to
the
scansion
,
and
to
the
pronunciation
;
and
I
suppose
that
this
*NL*
is
the
first
complete
edition
in
which
the
-LSB-
xix
-RSB-
spelling
has
been
tested
*NL*
by
phonetic
considerations
.
With
a
view
to
making
the
spelling
a
little
*NL*
clearer
and
more
consistent
,
I
have
ventured
to
adopt
certain
methods
which
*NL*
I
here
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
certain
words
of
variable
spelling
in
E.
,
such
as
_
whan
_
or
_
whanne
,
*NL*
than
_
or
_
thanne
_
,
I
have
adopted
that
form
which
the
scansion
requires
;
*NL*
but
the
MS.
is
usually
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
E.
usually
has
_
hise
_
for
_
his
_
with
a
plural
sb.
,
as
in
l.
1
;
I
use
_
his
_
*NL*
always
,
except
in
prose
.
E.
has
_
hir
,
here
_
,
for
her
,
their
;
I
use
_
hir
_
*NL*
only
,
except
at
the
end
of
a
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
E.
uses
the
endings
_
-
ight
_
or
_
-
yght
_
,
_
-
inde
_
or
_
-
ynde
_
;
I
use
_
-
ight
_
*NL*
_
-
inde
_
only
;
and
,
in
general
,
I
use
_
i
_
to
represent
short
_
i
_
,
and
_
y
_
to
*NL*
represent
long
_
i
_
,
as
in
_
king
,
wyf
_
.
Such
is
the
usual
habit
of
the
*NL*
scribe
,
but
he
often
changes
_
i
_
into
_
y
_
before
_
m
_
and
_
n
_
,
to
make
his
*NL*
writing
clearer
;
such
a
precaution
is
needless
in
modern
printing
.
Thus
,
in
*NL*
l.
42
,
I
replace
the
scribe
's
_
bigynne
_
by
_
biginne
_
;
and
in
l.
78
,
I
*NL*
replace
his
_
pilgrymage
_
by
_
pilgrimage
_
.
This
makes
the
text
easier
to
*NL*
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
like
reason
,
where
equivalent
spellings
occur
,
I
select
the
simpler
;
*NL*
writing
_
couthe
_
-LRB-
as
in
Pt
.
-RRB-
for
_
kowthe
_
,
_
sote
_
for
_
soote
_
,
_
sege
_
for
*NL*
_
seege
_
,
and
so
on
.
In
words
such
as
_
our
_
or
_
oure
_
,
_
your
_
or
_
youre
_
,
*NL*
_
hir
_
or
_
hire
_
,
_
neuer
_
or
_
neuere
_
,
I
usually
give
the
simpler
forms
,
*NL*
without
the
final
_
-
e
_
,
when
the
_
-
e
_
is
obviously
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
consonantal
_
u
_
,
as
in
_
neuer
_
,
I
write
_
v
_
,
as
in
_
never
_
.
This
is
*NL*
usual
in
all
editions
.
But
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
use
_
j
_
for
_
i
_
*NL*
consonant
;
the
anachronism
is
too
great
.
_
Never
_
for
_
neuer
_
is
common
in
*NL*
the
fifteenth
century
,
but
_
j
_
does
not
occur
even
in
the
first
folio
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
.
I
therefore
usually
keep
the
capital
_
i
_
of
the
MSS
.
and
of
*NL*
the
Elizabethan
printers
,
as
in
_
Ioye
_
-LRB-
=
_
joye
_
-RRB-
where
initial
,
and
the
*NL*
small
_
i
_
,
as
in
_
enioinen
_
=
_
enjoinen
_
-RRB-
elsewhere
.
Those
who
dislike
such
*NL*
conservatism
may
be
comforted
by
the
reflection
that
the
sound
rarely
*NL*
occurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
_
eye
_
has
to
be
altered
to
_
yë
_
at
the
end
of
a
line
,
to
preserve
*NL*
the
rimes
.
The
scribes
usually
write
_
eye
_
in
the
middle
of
a
line
,
but
*NL*
when
they
come
to
it
at
the
end
of
one
,
they
are
fairly
puzzled
.
In
l.
10
,
*NL*
the
scribe
of
Hn
.
writes
_
Iye
_
,
and
that
of
Ln
.
writes
_
yhe
_
;
and
the
*NL*
variations
on
this
theme
are
most
curious
.
The
spelling
_
ye
_
-LRB-
=
_
yë
_
-RRB-
is
,
*NL*
however
,
common
;
as
in
A
1096
-LRB-
Cm.
,
Pt
.
-RRB-
.
I
print
it
`
yë
'
to
distinguish
it
*NL*
from
_
ye
_
,
the
pl
.
pronoun
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
minute
variations
are
,
I
trust
,
legitimate
,
and
I
have
not
recorded
*NL*
them
.
They
cause
trouble
to
the
editor
,
but
afford
ease
-LSB-
xx
-RSB-
to
the
reader
,
*NL*
which
seems
a
sufficient
justification
for
adopting
them
.
But
the
*NL*
scrupulous
critic
need
not
fear
that
the
MS.
has
been
departed
from
in
any
*NL*
case
,
where
it
could
make
any
phonetic
difference
,
without
due
notice
.
*NL*
Thus
,
in
l.
9
,
where
I
have
changed
_
foweles
_
into
_
fowles
_
as
being
a
more
*NL*
usual
form
,
the
fact
that
_
foweles
_
is
the
Ellesmere
spelling
is
duly
*NL*
recorded
in
the
footnotes
.
And
so
in
other
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
footnotes
do
not
record
various
readings
where
E.
is
correct
as
it
*NL*
stands
;
they
have
purposely
been
made
as
concise
as
possible
.
It
would
have
*NL*
been
easy
to
multiply
them
fourfold
without
giving
much
information
of
*NL*
value
;
this
is
not
unfrequently
done
,
but
the
gain
is
slight
.
With
so
good
*NL*
a
MS.
as
the
basis
of
the
text
,
it
did
not
seem
desirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
methods
for
shortening
the
footnotes
have
been
adopted
.
*NL*
*NL*
1
.
Sometimes
only
the
readings
of
_
some
_
of
the
MSS
.
are
given
.
Thus
at
*NL*
l.
9
-LRB-
p.
1
-RRB-
,
I
omit
the
readings
of
Cp
.
and
of
Cm
.
As
a
fact
,
neither
*NL*
of
these
MSS
.
contain
the
line
;
but
it
was
not
worth
while
to
take
up
*NL*
space
by
saying
so
.
At
l.
10
-LRB-
p.
1
-RRB-
,
I
again
omit
the
readings
of
Cp
.
*NL*
and
of
Cm.
,
for
the
same
reason
;
also
of
Ln.
,
which
is
a
poor
MS.
,
*NL*
though
here
it
agrees
with
Hl
.
-LRB-
having
_
yhe
_
-RRB-
;
also
of
Pt.
,
which
has
*NL*
_
eyghe
_
,
a
spelling
not
here
to
be
thought
of
.
At
l.
12
,
I
just
note
*NL*
that
E.
has
_
pilgrimage
_
-LRB-
by
mistake
-RRB-
;
of
course
this
means
that
it
*NL*
should
have
had
_
pilgrimages
_
in
the
plural
,
as
in
other
MSS.
,
and
as
*NL*
required
by
the
rime
.
*NL*
*NL*
2
.
At
l.
23
-LRB-
p.
2
-RRB-
,
the
remark
'
_
rest
_
was
'
implies
that
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
seven
MSS
.
specially
collated
have
`
was
.
'
The
word
'
_
rest
_
'
is
a
*NL*
convenient
abbreviation
.
*NL*
*NL*
3
.
When
,
as
at
l.
53
,
I
give
_
nacions
_
as
a
rejected
reading
of
E.
in
*NL*
the
footnote
,
it
will
be
understood
that
_
naciouns
_
is
a
better
*NL*
spelling
,
justified
by
other
MSS.
,
and
by
other
lines
in
E.
itself
.
*NL*
E.g.
,
_
naciouns
_
occurs
in
Hl
.
and
Pt.
,
and
Cm
.
has
_
naciounnys
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
4
.
I
often
use
'
_
om

_
'
for

,

or

_
omits

as
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
5

At

p.

-RRB-
,
I
give
the
footnote
:
--
`

-RSB-
Hl

al.
'
This
means
*NL*
that
MS.
Hl
.
has
_
al
_
instead
of
the
word
_
ever
_
of
the
other
MSS
.
It
*NL*
seemed
worth
noting
;
but
_
ever
_
is
probably
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
6
.
At
l.
520
-LRB-
p.
16
-RRB-
,
the
note
is
:
--
'
_
All

'
That
is
,
*NL*
Hl
.
has
_
was
_
,
as
in
the
text
;
the
rest
have
_
this
was
_
,
where
the
*NL*
addition
of
_
this
_
sadly
clogs
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
hints
,
the
footnotes
present
no
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
,
I
have

The
sixte
thing
that
oghte
moeve
a

is
the
hope
of
*NL*
three
thynges
;
that
is
to

,
foryifnesse
of

,
and
the
yifte

and

with

And
for-as-muche
as

*NL*

285
And
therfore
seyde

aungel

whan

the

the

two

hardnesse

The
speces

sorwe
of

goodnesse

prosperitee
is

The
seconde

spece

Ioye

Som

digne
of
more
blame

The
seconde
spece

The

in

The
fifte
spece

this
;
for
to

gladly
and
herkne
gladly
to
the
*NL*
harm
that
men
speke

This
sinne
is
ful
greet

After

therto

consenteth

and
soothly
this
is
deedly
sinne

/
This
*NL*
Ire
is
so
displesant
to
god
,
that
it
troubleth
his
hous
and
chaceth
the
*NL*
holy
goost
out
of

wasteth

destroyeth

'
/
This
condicioun
of
bitternesse
hath
fyve
signes
.
The
firste
is
,
*NL*
that
confessioun
moste
be
shamefast
,
nat
for
to
covere
ne
hyden
his
sinne
,
*NL*
for
he
hath
agilt
his
god
and
defouled
his
soule
.
/
And
her-of
seith
seint
*NL*
Augustin
:
`
the
herte
travailleth
for
shame
of

sinne
'
;
and
for
he
hath
*NL*
greet
shamefastnesse
,
he
is
digne
to
have
greet
mercy
of
god
.
/
985
Swich
*NL*
was
the
confession
of
the
publican
,
that
wolde
nat
heven
up
hise
eyen
to
*NL*
hevene
,
for
he
hadde
offended
god
of

for
which
shamefastnesse
he
*NL*
hadde
anon

And
ther-of
seith
seint
Augustin
,
that
swich
*NL*
shamefast
folk
been
next
foryevenesse
and

/
Another
signe
is
*NL*
humilitee
in
confessioun
;
of
which
seith
seint
Peter
,
`
Humbleth
yow
under

The
hond
of
god
is
mighty
in
confession
,
for
ther-by
god
*NL*
foryeveth
thee

sinnes
;
for
he
allone
hath
the
power
.
/
And
this
*NL*
humilitee
shal
been
in
herte
,
and
in
signe
outward
;
for
right
as
he
hath
*NL*
humilitee
to

-LSB-

in
his
herte
,
right
so
sholde
he
humble
his
body
*NL*
outward
to
the
preest
that
sit
in
goddes
place

/
For
which
in
no
manere

sith
that

the
preest
mene

knele

but-if

For
he
shal
nat

in
whos

sitteth

A

wolde
holden
him
outrageous
,
and
nat
*NL*
worthy
so
sone
for
to
have
remissioun
ne
mercy

The
thridde
signe
is
,
how
*NL*
that
thy
shrift
sholde

ful
of

if
man
may

if

he

his

after
