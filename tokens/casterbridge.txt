THE
MAYOR
OF
CASTERBRIDGE
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
of
late
summer
,
before
the
nineteenth
century
had
reached
*NL*
one-third
of
its
span
,
a
young
man
and
woman
,
the
latter
carrying
a
*NL*
child
,
were
approaching
the
large
village
of
Weydon-Priors
,
in
Upper
*NL*
Wessex
,
on
foot
.
They
were
plainly
but
not
ill
clad
,
though
the
thick
*NL*
hoar
of
dust
which
had
accumulated
on
their
shoes
and
garments
from
*NL*
an
obviously
long
journey
lent
a
disadvantageous
shabbiness
to
their
*NL*
appearance
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
of
fine
figure
,
swarthy
,
and
stern
in
aspect
;
and
he
*NL*
showed
in
profile
a
facial
angle
so
slightly
inclined
as
to
be
almost
*NL*
perpendicular
.
He
wore
a
short
jacket
of
brown
corduroy
,
newer
than
the
*NL*
remainder
of
his
suit
,
which
was
a
fustian
waistcoat
with
white
horn
*NL*
buttons
,
breeches
of
the
same
,
tanned
leggings
,
and
a
straw
hat
overlaid
*NL*
with
black
glazed
canvas
.
At
his
back
he
carried
by
a
looped
strap
a
*NL*
rush
basket
,
from
which
protruded
at
one
end
the
crutch
of
a
hay-knife
,
*NL*
a
wimble
for
hay-bonds
being
also
visible
in
the
aperture
.
His
measured
,
*NL*
springless
walk
was
the
walk
of
the
skilled
countryman
as
distinct
from
*NL*
the
desultory
shamble
of
the
general
labourer
;
while
in
the
turn
and
*NL*
plant
of
each
foot
there
was
,
further
,
a
dogged
and
cynical
indifference
*NL*
personal
to
himself
,
showing
its
presence
even
in
the
regularly
*NL*
interchanging
fustian
folds
,
now
in
the
left
leg
,
now
in
the
right
,
as
*NL*
he
paced
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
really
peculiar
,
however
,
in
this
couple
's
progress
,
and
would
*NL*
have
attracted
the
attention
of
any
casual
observer
otherwise
disposed
*NL*
to
overlook
them
,
was
the
perfect
silence
they
preserved
.
They
walked
*NL*
side
by
side
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
afar
off
the
low
,
easy
,
*NL*
confidential
chat
of
people
full
of
reciprocity
;
but
on
closer
view
it
*NL*
could
be
discerned
that
the
man
was
reading
,
or
pretending
to
read
,
a
*NL*
ballad
sheet
which
he
kept
before
his
eyes
with
some
difficulty
by
the
*NL*
hand
that
was
passed
through
the
basket
strap
.
Whether
this
apparent
*NL*
cause
were
the
real
cause
,
or
whether
it
were
an
assumed
one
to
escape
*NL*
an
intercourse
that
would
have
been
irksome
to
him
,
nobody
but
himself
*NL*
could
have
said
precisely
;
but
his
taciturnity
was
unbroken
,
and
the
*NL*
woman
enjoyed
no
society
whatever
from
his
presence
.
Virtually
she
*NL*
walked
the
highway
alone
,
save
for
the
child
she
bore
.
Sometimes
the
*NL*
man
's
bent
elbow
almost
touched
her
shoulder
,
for
she
kept
as
close
to
*NL*
his
side
as
was
possible
without
actual
contact
,
but
she
seemed
to
*NL*
have
no
idea
of
taking
his
arm
,
nor
he
of
offering
it
;
and
far
from
*NL*
exhibiting
surprise
at
his
ignoring
silence
she
appeared
to
receive
it
*NL*
as
a
natural
thing
.
If
any
word
at
all
were
uttered
by
the
little
group
,
*NL*
it
was
an
occasional
whisper
of
the
woman
to
the
child
--
a
tiny
girl
in
*NL*
short
clothes
and
blue
boots
of
knitted
yarn
--
and
the
murmured
babble
of
*NL*
the
child
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
--
almost
the
only
--
attraction
of
the
young
woman
's
face
was
its
*NL*
mobility
.
When
she
looked
down
sideways
to
the
girl
she
became
pretty
,
*NL*
and
even
handsome
,
particularly
that
in
the
action
her
features
*NL*
caught
slantwise
the
rays
of
the
strongly
coloured
sun
,
which
made
*NL*
transparencies
of
her
eyelids
and
nostrils
and
set
fire
on
her
lips
.
*NL*
When
she
plodded
on
in
the
shade
of
the
hedge
,
silently
thinking
,
*NL*
she
had
the
hard
,
half-apathetic
expression
of
one
who
deems
anything
*NL*
possible
at
the
hands
of
Time
and
Chance
except
,
perhaps
,
fair
play
.
The
*NL*
first
phase
was
the
work
of
Nature
,
the
second
probably
of
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
man
and
woman
were
husband
and
wife
,
and
the
parents
of
*NL*
the
girl
in
arms
there
could
be
little
doubt
.
No
other
than
such
*NL*
relationship
would
have
accounted
for
the
atmosphere
of
stale
*NL*
familiarity
which
the
trio
carried
along
with
them
like
a
nimbus
as
they
*NL*
moved
down
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wife
mostly
kept
her
eyes
fixed
ahead
,
though
with
little
*NL*
interest
--
the
scene
for
that
matter
being
one
that
might
have
been
*NL*
matched
at
almost
any
spot
in
any
county
in
England
at
this
time
of
*NL*
the
year
;
a
road
neither
straight
nor
crooked
,
neither
level
nor
hilly
,
*NL*
bordered
by
hedges
,
trees
,
and
other
vegetation
,
which
had
entered
the
*NL*
blackened-green
stage
of
colour
that
the
doomed
leaves
pass
through
on
*NL*
their
way
to
dingy
,
and
yellow
,
and
red
.
The
grassy
margin
of
the
bank
,
*NL*
and
the
nearest
hedgerow
boughs
,
were
powdered
by
the
dust
that
had
been
*NL*
stirred
over
them
by
hasty
vehicles
,
the
same
dust
as
it
lay
on
the
road
*NL*
deadening
their
footfalls
like
a
carpet
;
and
this
,
with
the
aforesaid
*NL*
total
absence
of
conversation
,
allowed
every
extraneous
sound
to
be
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
there
was
none
,
beyond
the
voice
of
a
weak
bird
singing
*NL*
a
trite
old
evening
song
that
might
doubtless
have
been
heard
on
the
*NL*
hill
at
the
same
hour
,
and
with
the
self-same
trills
,
quavers
,
and
*NL*
breves
,
at
any
sunset
of
that
season
for
centuries
untold
.
But
as
they
*NL*
approached
the
village
sundry
distant
shouts
and
rattles
reached
their
*NL*
ears
from
some
elevated
spot
in
that
direction
,
as
yet
screened
from
*NL*
view
by
foliage
.
When
the
outlying
houses
of
Weydon-Priors
could
just
be
*NL*
described
,
the
family
group
was
met
by
a
turnip-hoer
with
his
hoe
on
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
and
his
dinner-bag
suspended
from
it
.
The
reader
promptly
*NL*
glanced
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
trade
doing
here
?
''
he
asked
phlegmatically
,
designating
the
village
*NL*
in
his
van
by
a
wave
of
the
broadsheet
.
And
thinking
the
labourer
did
*NL*
not
understand
him
,
he
added
,
``
Anything
in
the
hay-trussing
line
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
turnip-hoer
had
already
begun
shaking
his
head
.
``
Why
,
save
the
man
,
*NL*
what
wisdom
's
in
him
that
'
a
should
come
to
Weydon
for
a
job
of
that
*NL*
sort
this
time
o
'
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
is
there
any
house
to
let
--
a
little
small
new
cottage
just
a
*NL*
builded
,
or
such
like
?
''
asked
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pessimist
still
maintained
a
negative
.
``
Pulling
down
is
more
the
*NL*
nater
of
Weydon
.
There
were
five
houses
cleared
away
last
year
,
and
*NL*
three
this
;
and
the
volk
nowhere
to
go
--
no
,
not
so
much
as
a
thatched
*NL*
hurdle
;
that
's
the
way
o
'
Weydon-Priors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hay-trusser
,
which
he
obviously
was
,
nodded
with
some
*NL*
superciliousness
.
Looking
towards
the
village
,
he
continued
,
``
There
is
*NL*
something
going
on
here
,
however
,
is
there
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
.
'T
is
Fair
Day
.
Though
what
you
hear
now
is
little
more
than
the
*NL*
clatter
and
scurry
of
getting
away
the
money
o
'
children
and
fools
,
for
*NL*
the
real
business
is
done
earlier
than
this
.
I
've
been
working
within
*NL*
sound
o
'
t
all
day
,
but
I
did
n't
go
up
--
not
I.
'T
was
no
business
of
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trusser
and
his
family
proceeded
on
their
way
,
and
soon
entered
the
*NL*
Fair-field
,
which
showed
standing-places
and
pens
where
many
hundreds
of
*NL*
horses
and
sheep
had
been
exhibited
and
sold
in
the
forenoon
,
but
*NL*
were
now
in
great
part
taken
away
.
At
present
,
as
their
informant
had
*NL*
observed
,
but
little
real
business
remained
on
hand
,
the
chief
being
the
*NL*
sale
by
auction
of
a
few
inferior
animals
,
that
could
not
otherwise
*NL*
be
disposed
of
,
and
had
been
absolutely
refused
by
the
better
class
*NL*
of
traders
,
who
came
and
went
early
.
Yet
the
crowd
was
denser
now
*NL*
than
during
the
morning
hours
,
the
frivolous
contingent
of
visitors
,
*NL*
including
journeymen
out
for
a
holiday
,
a
stray
soldier
or
two
come
on
*NL*
furlough
,
village
shopkeepers
,
and
the
like
,
having
latterly
flocked
in
;
*NL*
persons
whose
activities
found
a
congenial
field
among
the
peep-shows
,
*NL*
toy-stands
,
waxworks
,
inspired
monsters
,
disinterested
medical
men
who
*NL*
travelled
for
the
public
good
,
thimble-riggers
,
nick-nack
vendors
,
and
*NL*
readers
of
Fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
our
pedestrians
had
much
heart
for
these
things
,
and
they
*NL*
looked
around
for
a
refreshment
tent
among
the
many
which
dotted
the
*NL*
down
.
Two
,
which
stood
nearest
to
them
in
the
ochreous
haze
of
expiring
*NL*
sunlight
,
seemed
almost
equally
inviting
.
One
was
formed
of
new
,
*NL*
milk-hued
canvas
,
and
bore
red
flags
on
its
summit
;
it
announced
``
Good
*NL*
Home-brewed
Beer
,
Ale
,
and
Cyder
.
''
The
other
was
less
new
;
a
little
iron
*NL*
stove-pipe
came
out
of
it
at
the
back
and
in
front
appeared
the
placard
,
*NL*
``
Good
Furmity
Sold
Hear
.
''
The
man
mentally
weighed
the
two
inscriptions
*NL*
and
inclined
to
the
former
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
the
other
one
,
''
said
the
woman
.
``
I
always
like
furmity
;
and
so
*NL*
does
Elizabeth-Jane
;
and
so
will
you
.
It
is
nourishing
after
a
long
hard
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
tasted
it
,
''
said
the
man
.
However
,
he
gave
way
to
her
*NL*
representations
,
and
they
entered
the
furmity
booth
forthwith
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rather
numerous
company
appeared
within
,
seated
at
the
long
narrow
*NL*
tables
that
ran
down
the
tent
on
each
side
.
At
the
upper
end
stood
a
*NL*
stove
,
containing
a
charcoal
fire
,
over
which
hung
a
large
three-legged
*NL*
crock
,
sufficiently
polished
round
the
rim
to
show
that
it
was
made
*NL*
of
bell-metal
.
A
haggish
creature
of
about
fifty
presided
,
in
a
white
*NL*
apron
,
which
as
it
threw
an
air
of
respectability
over
her
as
far
as
*NL*
it
extended
,
was
made
so
wide
as
to
reach
nearly
round
her
waist
.
She
*NL*
slowly
stirred
the
contents
of
the
pot
.
The
dull
scrape
of
her
large
*NL*
spoon
was
audible
throughout
the
tent
as
she
thus
kept
from
burning
the
*NL*
mixture
of
corn
in
the
grain
,
flour
,
milk
,
raisins
,
currants
,
and
what
*NL*
not
,
that
composed
the
antiquated
slop
in
which
she
dealt
.
Vessels
*NL*
holding
the
separate
ingredients
stood
on
a
white-clothed
table
of
*NL*
boards
and
trestles
close
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
and
woman
ordered
a
basin
each
of
the
mixture
,
steaming
*NL*
hot
,
and
sat
down
to
consume
it
at
leisure
.
This
was
very
well
so
far
,
*NL*
for
furmity
,
as
the
woman
had
said
,
was
nourishing
,
and
as
proper
a
*NL*
food
as
could
be
obtained
within
the
four
seas
;
though
,
to
those
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
it
,
the
grains
of
wheat
swollen
as
large
as
lemon-pips
,
*NL*
which
floated
on
its
surface
,
might
have
a
deterrent
effect
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
more
in
that
tent
than
met
the
cursory
glance
;
and
the
*NL*
man
,
with
the
instinct
of
a
perverse
character
,
scented
it
quickly
.
*NL*
After
a
mincing
attack
on
his
bowl
,
he
watched
the
hag
's
proceedings
*NL*
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
and
saw
the
game
she
played
.
He
winked
to
*NL*
her
,
and
passed
up
his
basin
in
reply
to
her
nod
;
when
she
took
a
bottle
*NL*
from
under
the
table
,
slily
measured
out
a
quantity
of
its
contents
,
and
*NL*
tipped
the
same
into
the
man
's
furmity
.
The
liquor
poured
in
was
rum
.
*NL*
The
man
as
slily
sent
back
money
in
payment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
concoction
,
thus
strongly
laced
,
much
more
to
his
*NL*
satisfaction
than
it
had
been
in
its
natural
state
.
His
wife
had
*NL*
observed
the
proceeding
with
much
uneasiness
;
but
he
persuaded
her
to
*NL*
have
hers
laced
also
,
and
she
agreed
to
a
milder
allowance
after
some
*NL*
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
finished
his
basin
,
and
called
for
another
,
the
rum
being
*NL*
signalled
for
in
yet
stronger
proportion
.
The
effect
of
it
was
soon
*NL*
apparent
in
his
manner
,
and
his
wife
but
too
sadly
perceived
that
in
*NL*
strenuously
steering
off
the
rocks
of
the
licensed
liquor-tent
she
had
*NL*
only
got
into
maelstrom
depths
here
amongst
the
smugglers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
began
to
prattle
impatiently
,
and
the
wife
more
than
once
said
*NL*
to
her
husband
,
``
Michael
,
how
about
our
lodging
?
You
know
we
may
have
*NL*
trouble
in
getting
it
if
we
do
n't
go
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
those
bird-like
chirpings
.
He
talked
loud
to
*NL*
the
company
.
The
child
's
black
eyes
,
after
slow
,
round
,
ruminating
gazes
*NL*
at
the
candles
when
they
were
lighted
,
fell
together
;
then
they
opened
,
*NL*
then
shut
again
,
and
she
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
first
basin
the
man
had
risen
to
serenity
;
at
the
*NL*
second
he
was
jovial
;
at
the
third
,
argumentative
,
at
the
fourth
,
the
*NL*
qualities
signified
by
the
shape
of
his
face
,
the
occasional
clench
of
*NL*
his
mouth
,
and
the
fiery
spark
of
his
dark
eye
,
began
to
tell
in
his
*NL*
conduct
;
he
was
overbearing
--
even
brilliantly
quarrelsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
took
a
high
turn
,
as
it
often
does
on
such
occasions
.
*NL*
The
ruin
of
good
men
by
bad
wives
,
and
,
more
particularly
,
the
*NL*
frustration
of
many
a
promising
youth
's
high
aims
and
hopes
and
the
*NL*
extinction
of
his
energies
by
an
early
imprudent
marriage
,
was
the
*NL*
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
for
myself
that
way
thoroughly
,
''
said
the
trusser
with
a
*NL*
contemplative
bitterness
that
was
well-night
resentful
.
``
I
married
at
*NL*
eighteen
,
like
the
fool
that
I
was
;
and
this
is
the
consequence
o
`
t.
''
He
*NL*
pointed
at
himself
and
family
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
intended
to
bring
*NL*
out
the
penuriousness
of
the
exhibition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
his
wife
,
who
seemed
accustomed
to
such
remarks
,
acted
*NL*
as
if
she
did
not
hear
them
,
and
continued
her
intermittent
private
*NL*
words
of
tender
trifles
to
the
sleeping
and
waking
child
,
who
was
just
*NL*
big
enough
to
be
placed
for
a
moment
on
the
bench
beside
her
when
she
*NL*
wished
to
ease
her
arms
.
The
man
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
more
than
fifteen
shillings
in
the
world
,
and
yet
I
am
a
good
*NL*
experienced
hand
in
my
line
.
I
'd
challenge
England
to
beat
me
in
the
*NL*
fodder
business
;
and
if
I
were
a
free
man
again
I
'd
be
worth
a
thousand
*NL*
pound
before
I
'd
done
o
`
t
.
But
a
fellow
never
knows
these
little
things
*NL*
till
all
chance
of
acting
upon
'em
is
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
auctioneer
selling
the
old
horses
in
the
field
outside
could
be
*NL*
heard
saying
,
``
Now
this
is
the
last
lot
--
now
who
'll
take
the
last
*NL*
lot
for
a
song
?
Shall
I
say
forty
shillings
?
'T
is
a
very
promising
*NL*
broodmare
,
a
trifle
over
five
years
old
,
and
nothing
the
matter
with
the
*NL*
hoss
at
all
,
except
that
she
's
a
little
holler
in
the
back
and
had
her
*NL*
left
eye
knocked
out
by
the
kick
of
another
,
her
own
sister
,
coming
*NL*
along
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
I
do
n't
see
why
men
who
have
got
wives
and
do
n't
want
'em
,
*NL*
should
n't
get
rid
of
'em
as
these
gipsy
fellows
do
their
old
horses
,
''
*NL*
said
the
man
in
the
tent
.
``
Why
should
n't
they
put
'em
up
and
sell
'em
*NL*
by
auction
to
men
who
are
in
need
of
such
articles
?
Hey
?
Why
,
begad
,
I
'd
*NL*
sell
mine
this
minute
if
anybody
would
buy
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
them
that
would
do
that
,
''
some
of
the
guests
replied
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
woman
,
who
was
by
no
means
ill-favoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
a
smoking
gentleman
,
whose
coat
had
the
fine
polish
about
*NL*
the
collar
,
elbows
,
seams
,
and
shoulder-blades
that
long-continued
*NL*
friction
with
grimy
surfaces
will
produce
,
and
which
is
usually
more
*NL*
desired
on
furniture
than
on
clothes
.
From
his
appearance
he
had
*NL*
possibly
been
in
former
time
groom
or
coachman
to
some
neighbouring
*NL*
county
family
.
``
I
've
had
my
breedings
in
as
good
circles
,
I
may
say
,
as
*NL*
any
man
,
''
he
added
,
``
and
I
know
true
cultivation
,
or
nobody
do
;
and
I
*NL*
can
declare
she
's
got
it
--
in
the
bone
,
mind
ye
,
I
say
--
as
much
as
any
*NL*
female
in
the
fair
--
though
it
may
want
a
little
bringing
out
.
''
Then
,
*NL*
crossing
his
legs
,
he
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
nicely-adjusted
gaze
at
a
*NL*
point
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fuddled
young
husband
stared
for
a
few
seconds
at
this
unexpected
*NL*
praise
of
his
wife
,
half
in
doubt
of
the
wisdom
of
his
own
attitude
*NL*
towards
the
possessor
of
such
qualities
.
But
he
speedily
lapsed
into
his
*NL*
former
conviction
,
and
said
harshly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
now
is
your
chance
;
I
am
open
to
an
offer
for
this
gem
o
'
*NL*
creation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
her
husband
and
murmured
,
``
Michael
,
you
have
talked
this
*NL*
nonsense
in
public
places
before
.
A
joke
is
a
joke
,
but
you
may
make
it
*NL*
once
too
often
,
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
've
said
it
before
;
I
meant
it
.
All
I
want
is
a
buyer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
a
swallow
,
one
among
the
last
of
the
season
,
which
had
by
*NL*
chance
found
its
way
through
an
opening
into
the
upper
part
of
the
tent
,
*NL*
flew
to
and
from
quick
curves
above
their
heads
,
causing
all
eyes
to
*NL*
follow
it
absently
.
In
watching
the
bird
till
it
made
its
escape
the
*NL*
assembled
company
neglected
to
respond
to
the
workman
's
offer
,
and
the
*NL*
subject
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
man
,
who
had
gone
on
lacing
his
*NL*
furmity
more
and
more
heavily
,
though
he
was
either
so
strong-minded
or
*NL*
such
an
intrepid
toper
that
he
still
appeared
fairly
sober
,
recurred
to
*NL*
the
old
strain
,
as
in
a
musical
fantasy
the
instrument
fetches
up
the
*NL*
original
theme
.
``
Here
--
I
am
waiting
to
know
about
this
offer
of
mine
.
*NL*
The
woman
is
no
good
to
me
.
Who
'll
have
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
had
by
this
time
decidedly
degenerated
,
and
the
renewed
*NL*
inquiry
was
received
with
a
laugh
of
appreciation
.
The
woman
whispered
;
*NL*
she
was
imploring
and
anxious
:
``
Come
,
come
,
it
is
getting
dark
,
and
*NL*
this
nonsense
wo
n't
do
.
If
you
do
n't
come
along
,
I
shall
go
without
you
.
*NL*
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
and
waited
;
yet
he
did
not
move
.
In
ten
minutes
the
man
broke
*NL*
in
upon
the
desultory
conversation
of
the
furmity
drinkers
with
.
``
I
*NL*
asked
this
question
,
and
nobody
answered
to

t.
Will
any
Jack
Rag
or
Tom
*NL*
Straw
among
ye
buy
my
goods
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
manner
changed
,
and
her
face
assumed
the
grim
shape
and
*NL*
colour
of
which
mention
has
been
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mike
,
Mike
,
''
she
said
;
``
this
is
getting
serious
.
O
!
--
too
serious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
anybody
buy
her
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
somebody
would

''
said
she
firmly
.
``
Her
present
owner
is
not
at
*NL*
all
to
her
liking
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
you

said
he
.
``
So
we
are
agreed

an
agreement

She

to

go
her
ways

I
'll
take
my
tools

and
go
my
ways

'T
is
simple
as
*NL*
Scripture
history
.
Now
then

stand
up

Susan
,
and
show
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
my
chiel
,
''
whispered
a
buxom
staylace
dealer
in
voluminous
*NL*
petticoats
,
who
sat
near
the
woman
;
``
yer
good
man
do
n't
know
what
he
's
*NL*
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
,
however
,
did
stand
up
.
``
Now
,
who
's
auctioneer
?
''
cried
the
*NL*
hay-trusser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
be

''
promptly
answered
a
short
man
,
with
a
nose
resembling
a
copper
*NL*
knob
,
a
damp
voice
,
and
eyes
like
button-holes
.
``
Who
'll
make
an
offer
*NL*
for
this
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
looked
on
the
ground
,
as
if
she
maintained
her
position
by
a
*NL*
supreme
effort
of
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
shillings
,
''
said
someone
,
at
which
there
was
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
insults
,
''
said
the
husband
.
``
Who
'll
say
a
guinea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
answered
;
and
the
female
dealer
in
staylaces
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behave
yerself
moral
,
good
man

for
Heaven

Ah

*NL*
*NL*
``
Set

said
the
trusser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two

said
the
auctioneer
;
and
no
one
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

said
the

.
``
Very

another

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
rheumy
man

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
the
auctioneer

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
*NL*
husband

bringing
down
his
fist
so
that
the
basins
danced
.

Now

five
guineas

and

*NL*
Susan
,
you
agree

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
with
absolute
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
guineas
,
''
said
the
auctioneer
,
``
or
she
'll
be
withdrawn

Do
anybody

give
it
?
The
last
time

Yes
or
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
a
loud
voice
from
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
turned
.
Standing
in
the
triangular
opening
which
formed
*NL*
the
door
of
the
tent
was
a
sailor
,
who
,
unobserved
by
the
rest
,
had
*NL*
arrived
there
within
the
last
two
or
three
minutes
.
A
dead
silence
*NL*
followed
his
affirmation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
do
?
''
asked
the
husband
,
staring
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
so
,
''
replied
the
sailor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saying
is
one
thing
,
and
paying
is
another
.
Where
's
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
hesitated
a
moment
,
looked
anew
at
the
woman
,
came
in
,
*NL*
unfolded
five
crisp
pieces
of
paper
,
and
threw
them
down
upon
the
*NL*
tablecloth
.
They
were
Bank-of-England
notes
for
five
pounds
.
Upon
the
*NL*
face
of
this
he
clinked
down
the
shillings
severally
--
one
,
two
,
three
,
*NL*
four
,
five
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
real
money
in
full
amount
,
in
answer
to
a
challenge
for
the
*NL*
same
till
then
deemed
slightly
hypothetical
had
a
great
effect
upon
*NL*
the
spectators
.
Their
eyes
became
riveted
upon
the
faces
of
the
chief
*NL*
actors
,
and
then
upon
the
notes
as
they
lay
,
weighted
by
the
shillings
,
*NL*
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
moment
it
could
not
positively
have
been
asserted
that
the
*NL*
man
,
in
spite
of
his
tantalizing
declaration
,
was
really
in
earnest
.
*NL*
The
spectators
had
indeed
taken
the
proceedings
throughout
as
a
piece
of
*NL*
mirthful
irony
carried
to
extremes
;
and
had
assumed
that
,
being
out
*NL*
of
work
,
he
was
,
as
a
consequence
,
out
of
temper
with
the
world
,
and
*NL*
society
,
and
his
nearest
kin
.
But
with
the
demand
and
response
of
real
*NL*
cash
the
jovial
frivolity
of
the
scene
departed
.
A
lurid
colour
*NL*
seemed
to
fill
the
tent
,
and
change
the
aspect
of
all
therein
.
The
*NL*
mirth-wrinkles
left
the
listeners
'
faces
,
and
they
waited
with
parting
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
woman
,
breaking
the
silence
,
so
that
her
low
dry
voice
*NL*
sounded
quite
loud
,
``
before
you
go
further
,
Michael
,
listen
to
me
.
If
*NL*
you
touch
that
money
,
I
and
this
girl
go
with
the
man
.
Mind
,
it
is
a
*NL*
joke
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
joke
?
Of
course
it
is
not
a
joke
!
''
shouted
her
husband
,
his
*NL*
resentment
rising
at
her
suggestion
.
``
I
take
the
money
;
the
sailor
takes
*NL*
you
.
That
's
plain
enough
.
It
has
been
done
elsewhere
--
and
why
not
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
quite
on
the
understanding
that
the
young
woman
is
willing
,
''
said
*NL*
the
sailor
blandly
.
``
I
would
n't
hurt
her
feelings
for
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
nor
I
,
''
said
her
husband
.
``
But
she
is
willing
,
provided
she
can
*NL*
have
the
child

She
said
so
only
the
other
day
when
I
talked
o
`
t
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
swear
?
''
said
the
sailor
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
she
,
after
glancing
at
her
husband
's
face
and
seeing
no
*NL*
repentance
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
she
shall
have
the
child
,
and
the
bargain
's
complete
,
''
said
*NL*
the
trusser
.
He
took
the
sailor
's
notes
and
deliberately
folded
them
,
*NL*
and
put
them
with
the
shillings
in
a
high
remote
pocket
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
finality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
looked
at
the
woman
and
smiled
.
``
Come
along
!
''
he
said
kindly
.
*NL*
``
The
little
one
too
--
the
more
the
merrier
!
''
She
paused
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
with
a
close
glance
at
him
.
Then
dropping
her
eyes
again
,
and
saying
*NL*
nothing
,
she
took
up
the
child
and
followed
him
as
he
made
towards
the
*NL*
door
.
On
reaching
it
,
she
turned
,
and
pulling
off
her
wedding-ring
,
*NL*
flung
it
across
the
booth
in
the
hay-trusser
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mike
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
've
lived
with
thee
a
couple
of
years
,
and
had
*NL*
nothing
but
temper
!
Now
I
'm
no
more
to
`
ee
;
I
'll
try
my
luck
elsewhere
.
*NL*
`
Twill
be
better
for
me
and
Elizabeth-Jane
,
both
.
So
good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seizing
the
sailor
's
arm
with
her
right
hand
,
and
mounting
the
little
*NL*
girl
on
her
left
,
she
went
out
of
the
tent
sobbing
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stolid
look
of
concern
filled
the
husband
's
face
,
as
if
,
after
all
,
he
*NL*
had
not
quite
anticipated
this
ending
;
and
some
of
the
guests
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
gone
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
ay
!
she
's
gone
clane
enough
,
''
said
some
rustics
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
walked
to
the
entrance
with
the
careful
tread
of
one
*NL*
conscious
of
his
alcoholic
load
.
Some
others
followed
,
and
they
stood
*NL*
looking
into
the
twilight
.
The
difference
between
the
peacefulness
of
*NL*
inferior
nature
and
the
wilful
hostilities
of
mankind
was
very
apparent
*NL*
at
this
place
.
In
contrast
with
the
harshness
of
the
act
just
ended
*NL*
within
the
tent
was
the
sight
of
several
horses
crossing
their
necks
and
*NL*
rubbing
each
other
lovingly
as
they
waited
in
patience
to
be
harnessed
*NL*
for
the
homeward
journey
.
Outside
the
fair
,
in
the
valleys
and
woods
,
*NL*
all
was
quiet
.
The
sun
had
recently
set
,
and
the
west
heaven
was
hung
*NL*
with
rosy
cloud
,
which
seemed
permanent
,
yet
slowly
changed
.
To
watch
*NL*
it
was
like
looking
at
some
grand
feat
of
stagery
from
a
darkened
*NL*
auditorium
.
In
presence
of
this
scene
after
the
other
there
was
a
*NL*
natural
instinct
to
abjure
man
as
the
blot
on
an
otherwise
kindly
*NL*
universe
;
till
it
was
remembered
that
all
terrestrial
conditions
were
*NL*
intermittent
,
and
that
mankind
might
some
night
be
innocently
sleeping
*NL*
when
these
quiet
objects
were
raging
loud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
the
sailor
live
?
''
asked
a
spectator
,
when
they
had
vainly
*NL*
gazed
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
that
,
''
replied
the
man
who
had
seen
high
life
.
``
He
's
without
*NL*
doubt
a
stranger
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
in
about
five
minutes
ago
,
''
said
the
furmity
woman
,
joining
the
*NL*
rest
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
.
``
And
then
'
a
stepped
back
,
and
then
'
a
*NL*
looked
in
again
.
I
'm
not
a
penny
the
better
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serves
the
husband
well
be-right
,
''
said
the
staylace
vendor
.
``
A
comely
*NL*
respectable
body
like
her
--
what
can
a
man
want
more
?
I
glory
in
the
*NL*
woman
's
sperrit
.
I
'd
ha
'
done
it
myself
--
od
send
if
I
would
n't
,
if
a
*NL*
husband
had
behaved
so
to
me
!
I
'd
go
,
and
'
a
might
call
,
and
call
,
till
*NL*
his
keacorn
was
raw
;
but
I
'd
never
come
back
--
no
,
not
till
the
great
*NL*
trumpet
,
would
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
woman
will
be
better
off
,
''
said
another
of
a
more
*NL*
deliberative
turn
.
``
For
seafaring
natures
be
very
good
shelter
for
shorn
*NL*
lambs
,
and
the
man
do
seem
to
have
plenty
of
money
,
which
is
what
she
's
*NL*
not
been
used
to
lately
,
by
all
showings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mark
me
--
I
'll
not
go
after
her
!
''
said
the
trusser
,
returning
doggedly
*NL*
to
his
seat
.
``
Let
her
go
!
If
she
's
up
to
such
vagaries
she
must
suffer
*NL*
for
'em
.
She
'd
no
business
to
take
the
maid
--
't
is
my
maid
;
and
if
it
*NL*
were
the
doing
again
she
should
n't
have
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
from
some
little
sense
of
having
countenanced
an
indefensible
*NL*
proceeding
,
perhaps
because
it
was
late
,
the
customers
thinned
away
*NL*
from
the
tent
shortly
after
this
episode
.
The
man
stretched
his
elbows
*NL*
forward
on
the
table
leant
his
face
upon
his
arms
,
and
soon
began
to
*NL*
snore
.
The
furmity
seller
decided
to
close
for
the
night
,
and
after
*NL*
seeing
the
rum-bottles
,
milk
,
corn
,
raisins
,
etc.
,
that
remained
on
*NL*
hand
,
loaded
into
the
cart
,
came
to
where
the
man
reclined
.
She
shook
*NL*
him
,
but
could
not
wake
him
.
As
the
tent
was
not
to
be
struck
that
*NL*
night
,
the
fair
continuing
for
two
or
three
days
,
she
decided
to
let
the
*NL*
sleeper
,
who
was
obviously
no
tramp
,
stay
where
he
was
,
and
his
basket
*NL*
with
him
.
Extinguishing
the
last
candle
,
and
lowering
the
flap
of
the
*NL*
tent
,
she
left
it
,
and
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
2
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
sun
was
streaming
through
the
crevices
of
the
canvas
when
*NL*
the
man
awoke
.
A
warm
glow
pervaded
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
marquee
,
*NL*
and
a
single
big
blue
fly
buzzed
musically
round
and
round
it
.
Besides
*NL*
the
buzz
of
the
fly
there
was
not
a
sound
.
He
looked
about
--
at
the
*NL*
benches
--
at
the
table
supported
by
trestles
--
at
his
basket
of
tools
--
at
*NL*
the
stove
where
the
furmity
had
been
boiled
--
at
the
empty
basins
--
at
*NL*
some
shed
grains
of
wheat
--
at
the
corks
which
dotted
the
grassy
floor
.
*NL*
Among
the
odds
and
ends
he
discerned
a
little
shining
object
,
and
picked
*NL*
it
up
.
It
was
his
wife
's
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
confused
picture
of
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
seemed
to
come
*NL*
back
to
him
,
and
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast-pocket
.
A
rustling
*NL*
revealed
the
sailor
's
bank-notes
thrust
carelessly
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
verification
of
his
dim
memories
was
enough
;
he
knew
now
*NL*
they
were
not
dreams
.
He
remained
seated
,
looking
on
the
ground
for
some
*NL*
time
.
``
I
must
get
out
of
this
as
soon
as
I
can
,
''
he
said
deliberately
*NL*
at
last
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
could
not
catch
his
thoughts
without
*NL*
pronouncing
them
.
``
She
's
gone
--
to
be
sure
she
is
--
gone
with
that
sailor
*NL*
who
bought
her
,
and
little
Elizabeth-Jane
.
We
walked
here
,
and
I
had
the
*NL*
furmity
,
and
rum
in
it
--
and
sold
her
.
Yes
,
that
's
what
's
happened
and
*NL*
here
am
I.
Now
,
what
am
I
to
do
--
am
I
sober
enough
to
walk
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
He
stood
up
,
found
that
he
was
in
fairly
good
condition
for
progress
,
*NL*
unencumbered
.
Next
he
shouldered
his
tool
basket
,
and
found
he
could
*NL*
carry
it
.
Then
lifting
the
tent
door
he
emerged
into
the
open
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
man
looked
around
with
gloomy
curiosity
.
The
freshness
of
the
*NL*
September
morning
inspired
and
braced
him
as
he
stood
.
He
and
his
family
*NL*
had
been
weary
when
they
arrived
the
night
before
,
and
they
had
observed
*NL*
but
little
of
the
place
;
so
that
he
now
beheld
it
as
a
new
thing
.
It
*NL*
exhibited
itself
as
the
top
of
an
open
down
,
bounded
on
one
extreme
by
*NL*
a
plantation
,
and
approached
by
a
winding
road
.
At
the
bottom
stood
the
*NL*
village
which
lent
its
name
to
the
upland
and
the
annual
fair
that
was
*NL*
held
thereon
.
The
spot
stretched
downward
into
valleys
,
and
onward
to
*NL*
other
uplands
,
dotted
with
barrows
,
and
trenched
with
the
remains
of
*NL*
prehistoric
forts
.
The
whole
scene
lay
under
the
rays
of
a
newly
risen
*NL*
sun
,
which
had
not
as
yet
dried
a
single
blade
of
the
heavily
dewed
*NL*
grass
,
whereon
the
shadows
of
the
yellow
and
red
vans
were
projected
far
*NL*
away
,
those
thrown
by
the
felloe
of
each
wheel
being
elongated
in
shape
*NL*
to
the
orbit
of
a
comet
.
All
the
gipsies
and
showmen
who
had
remained
*NL*
on
the
ground
lay
snug
within
their
carts
and
tents
or
wrapped
in
*NL*
horse-cloths
under
them
,
and
were
silent
and
still
as
death
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
an
occasional
snore
that
revealed
their
presence
.
But
*NL*
the
Seven
Sleepers
had
a
dog
;
and
dogs
of
the
mysterious
breeds
that
*NL*
vagrants
own
,
that
are
as
much
like
cats
as
dogs
and
as
much
like
foxes
*NL*
as
cats
also
lay
about
here
.
A
little
one
started
up
under
one
of
the
*NL*
carts
,
barked
as
a
matter
of
principle
,
and
quickly
lay
down
again
.
*NL*
He
was
the
only
positive
spectator
of
the
hay-trusser
's
exit
from
the
*NL*
Weydon
Fair-field
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
accord
with
his
desire
.
He
went
on
in
silent
thought
,
*NL*
unheeding
the
yellowhammers
which
flitted
about
the
hedges
with
straws
*NL*
in
their
bills
,
the
crowns
of
the
mushrooms
,
and
the
tinkling
of
local
*NL*
sheep-bells
,
whose
wearer
had
had
the
good
fortune
not
to
be
included
*NL*
in
the
fair
.
When
he
reached
a
lane
,
a
good
mile
from
the
scene
of
the
*NL*
previous
evening
,
the
man
pitched
his
basket
and
leant
upon
a
gate
.
A
*NL*
difficult
problem
or
two
occupied
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
tell
my
name
to
anybody
last
night
,
or
did
n't
I
tell
my
name
?
''
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
;
and
at
last
concluded
that
he
did
not
.
His
general
*NL*
demeanour
was
enough
to
show
how
he
was
surprised
and
nettled
that
his
*NL*
wife
had
taken
him
so
literally
--
as
much
could
be
seen
in
his
face
,
and
*NL*
in
the
way
he
nibbled
a
straw
which
he
pulled
from
the
hedge
.
He
knew
*NL*
that
she
must
have
been
somewhat
excited
to
do
this
;
moreover
,
she
*NL*
must
have
believed
that
there
was
some
sort
of
binding
force
in
the
*NL*
transaction
.
On
this
latter
point
he
felt
almost
certain
,
knowing
her
*NL*
freedom
from
levity
of
character
,
and
the
extreme
simplicity
of
her
*NL*
intellect
.
There
may
,
too
,
have
been
enough
recklessness
and
resentment
*NL*
beneath
her
ordinary
placidity
to
make
her
stifle
any
momentary
doubts
.
*NL*
On
a
previous
occasion
when
he
had
declared
during
a
fuddle
that
he
*NL*
would
dispose
of
her
as
he
had
done
,
she
had
replied
that
she
would
not
*NL*
hear
him
say
that
many
times
more
before
it
happened
,
in
the
resigned
*NL*
tones
of
a
fatalist
...
``
Yet
she
knows
I
am
not
in
my
senses
when
I
do
*NL*
that
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Well
,
I
must
walk
about
till
I
find
her
...
Seize
*NL*
her
,
why
did
n't
she
know
better
than
bring
me
into
this
disgrace
!
''
he
*NL*
roared
out
.
``
She
was
n't
queer
if
I
was
.
'T
is
like
Susan
to
show
such
*NL*
idiotic
simplicity
.
Meek
--
that
meekness
has
done
me
more
harm
than
the
*NL*
bitterest
temper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
calmer
he
turned
to
his
original
conviction
that
he
must
*NL*
somehow
find
her
and
his
little
Elizabeth-Jane
,
and
put
up
with
the
*NL*
shame
as
best
he
could
.
It
was
of
his
own
making
,
and
he
ought
to
bear
*NL*
it
.
But
first
he
resolved
to
register
an
oath
,
a
greater
oath
than
he
*NL*
had
ever
sworn
before
:
and
to
do
it
properly
he
required
a
fit
place
and
*NL*
imagery
;
for
there
was
something
fetichistic
in
this
man
's
beliefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shouldered
his
basket
and
moved
on
,
casting
his
eyes
inquisitively
*NL*
round
upon
the
landscape
as
he
walked
,
and
at
the
distance
of
three
or
*NL*
four
miles
perceived
the
roofs
of
a
village
and
the
tower
of
a
church
.
*NL*
He
instantly
made
towards
the
latter
object
.
The
village
was
quite
*NL*
still
,
it
being
that
motionless
hour
of
rustic
daily
life
which
fills
*NL*
the
interval
between
the
departure
of
the
field-labourers
to
their
work
,
*NL*
and
the
rising
of
their
wives
and
daughters
to
prepare
the
breakfast
for
*NL*
their
return
.
Hence
he
reached
the
church
without
observation
,
and
the
*NL*
door
being
only
latched
he
entered
.
The
hay-trusser
deposited
his
basket
*NL*
by
the
font
,
went
up
the
nave
till
he
reached
the
altar-rails
,
and
*NL*
opening
the
gate
entered
the
sacrarium
,
where
he
seemed
to
feel
a
*NL*
sense
of
the
strangeness
for
a
moment
;
then
he
knelt
upon
the
*NL*
footpace
.
Dropping
his
head
upon
the
clamped
book
which
lay
on
the
*NL*
Communion-table
,
he
said
aloud
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
Michael
Henchard
,
on
this
morning
of
the
sixteenth
of
September
,
do
*NL*
take
an
oath
before
God
here
in
this
solemn
place
that
I
will
avoid
all
*NL*
strong
liquors
for
the
space
of
twenty-one
years
to
come
,
being
a
year
*NL*
for
every
year
that
I
have
lived
.
And
this
I
swear
upon
the
book
before
*NL*
me
;
and
may
I
be
strook
dumb
,
blind
,
and
helpless
,
if
I
break
this
my
*NL*
oath
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
said
it
and
kissed
the
big
book
,
the
hay-trusser
arose
,
*NL*
and
seemed
relieved
at
having
made
a
start
in
a
new
direction
.
While
*NL*
standing
in
the
porch
a
moment
he
saw
a
thick
jet
of
wood
smoke
suddenly
*NL*
start
up
from
the
red
chimney
of
a
cottage
near
,
and
knew
that
the
*NL*
occupant
had
just
lit
her
fire
.
He
went
round
to
the
door
,
and
the
*NL*
housewife
agreed
to
prepare
him
some
breakfast
for
a
trifling
payment
,
*NL*
which
was
done
.
Then
he
started
on
the
search
for
his
wife
and
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
perplexing
nature
of
the
undertaking
became
apparent
soon
enough
.
*NL*
Though
he
examined
and
inquired
,
and
walked
hither
and
thither
day
after
*NL*
day
,
no
such
characters
as
those
he
described
had
anywhere
been
seen
*NL*
since
the
evening
of
the
fair
.
To
add
to
the
difficulty
he
could
gain
*NL*
no
sound
of
the
sailor
's
name
.
As
money
was
short
with
him
he
decided
,
*NL*
after
some
hesitation
,
to
spend
the
sailor
's
money
in
the
prosecution
*NL*
of
this
search
;
but
it
was
equally
in
vain
.
The
truth
was
that
a
*NL*
certain
shyness
of
revealing
his
conduct
prevented
Michael
Henchard
from
*NL*
following
up
the
investigation
with
the
loud
hue-and-cry
such
a
pursuit
*NL*
demanded
to
render
it
effectual
;
and
it
was
probably
for
this
reason
*NL*
that
he
obtained
no
clue
,
though
everything
was
done
by
him
that
did
not
*NL*
involve
an
explanation
of
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
lost
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weeks
counted
up
to
months
,
and
still
he
searched
on
,
maintaining
*NL*
himself
by
small
jobs
of
work
in
the
intervals
.
By
this
time
he
had
*NL*
arrived
at
a
seaport
,
and
there
he
derived
intelligence
that
persons
*NL*
answering
somewhat
to
his
description
had
emigrated
a
little
time
*NL*
before
.
Then
he
said
he
would
search
no
longer
,
and
that
he
would
go
and
*NL*
settle
in
the
district
which
he
had
had
for
some
time
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
started
,
journeying
south-westward
,
and
did
not
pause
,
*NL*
except
for
nights
'
lodgings
,
till
he
reached
the
town
of
Casterbridge
,
*NL*
in
a
far
distant
part
of
Wessex
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
highroad
into
the
village
of
Weydon-Priors
was
again
carpeted
with
*NL*
dust
.
The
trees
had
put
on
as
of
yore
their
aspect
of
dingy
green
,
and
*NL*
where
the
Henchard
family
of
three
had
once
walked
along
,
two
persons
*NL*
not
unconnected
with
the
family
walked
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
in
its
broad
aspect
had
so
much
of
its
previous
character
,
*NL*
even
to
the
voices
and
rattle
from
the
neighbouring
village
down
,
*NL*
that
it
might
for
that
matter
have
been
the
afternoon
following
the
*NL*
previously
recorded
episode
.
Change
was
only
to
be
observed
in
details
;
*NL*
but
here
it
was
obvious
that
a
long
procession
of
years
had
passed
by
.
*NL*
One
of
the
two
who
walked
the
road
was
she
who
had
figured
as
the
young
*NL*
wife
of
Henchard
on
the
previous
occasion
;
now
her
face
had
lost
much
of
*NL*
its
rotundity
;
her
skin
had
undergone
a
textural
change
;
and
though
her
*NL*
hair
had
not
lost
colour
it
was
considerably
thinner
than
heretofore
.
*NL*
She
was
dressed
in
the
mourning
clothes
of
a
widow
.
Her
companion
,
*NL*
also
in
black
,
appeared
as
a
well-formed
young
woman
about
eighteen
,
*NL*
completely
possessed
of
that
ephemeral
precious
essence
youth
,
which
is
*NL*
itself
beauty
,
irrespective
of
complexion
or
contour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glance
was
sufficient
to
inform
the
eye
that
this
was
Susan
Henchard
's
*NL*
grown-up
daughter
.
While
life
's
middle
summer
had
set
its
hardening
*NL*
mark
on
the
mother
's
face
,
her
former
spring-like
specialities
were
*NL*
transferred
so
dexterously
by
Time
to
the
second
figure
,
her
child
,
*NL*
that
the
absence
of
certain
facts
within
her
mother
's
knowledge
from
the
*NL*
girl
's
mind
would
have
seemed
for
the
moment
,
to
one
reflecting
on
those
*NL*
facts
,
to
be
a
curious
imperfection
in
Nature
's
powers
of
continuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
with
joined
hands
,
and
it
could
be
perceived
that
this
was
*NL*
the
act
of
simple
affection
.
The
daughter
carried
in
her
outer
hand
*NL*
a
withy
basket
of
old-fashioned
make
;
the
mother
a
blue
bundle
,
which
*NL*
contrasted
oddly
with
her
black
stuff
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
the
outskirts
of
the
village
they
pursued
the
same
track
as
*NL*
formerly
,
and
ascended
to
the
fair
.
Here
,
too
it
was
evident
that
the
*NL*
years
had
told
.
Certain
mechanical
improvements
might
have
been
noticed
*NL*
in
the
roundabouts
and
high-fliers
,
machines
for
testing
rustic
strength
*NL*
and
weight
,
and
in
the
erections
devoted
to
shooting
for
nuts
.
But
the
*NL*
real
business
of
the
fair
had
considerably
dwindled
.
The
new
periodical
*NL*
great
markets
of
neighbouring
towns
were
beginning
to
interfere
*NL*
seriously
with
the
trade
carried
on
here
for
centuries
.
The
pens
for
*NL*
sheep
,
the
tie-ropes
for
horses
,
were
about
half
as
long
as
they
had
*NL*
been
.
The
stalls
of
tailors
,
hosiers
,
coopers
,
linen-drapers
,
and
other
*NL*
such
trades
had
almost
disappeared
,
and
the
vehicles
were
far
less
*NL*
numerous
.
The
mother
and
daughter
threaded
the
crowd
for
some
little
*NL*
distance
,
and
then
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
we
hinder
our
time
by
coming
in
here
?
I
thought
you
wished
to
*NL*
get
onward
?
''
said
the
maiden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
Elizabeth-Jane
,
''
explained
the
other
.
``
But
I
had
a
fancy
*NL*
for
looking
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
here
I
first
met
with
Newson
--
on
such
a
day
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
met
with
father
here
?
Yes
,
you
have
told
me
so
before
.
And
now
*NL*
he
's
drowned
and
gone
from
us
!
''
As
she
spoke
the
girl
drew
a
card
from
*NL*
her
pocket
and
looked
at
it
with
a
sigh
.
It
was
edged
with
black
,
and
*NL*
inscribed
within
a
design
resembling
a
mural
tablet
were
the
words
,
``
In
*NL*
affectionate
memory
of
Richard
Newson
,
mariner
,
who
was
unfortunately
*NL*
lost
at
sea
,
in
the
month
of
November
184
--
,
aged
forty-one
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
was
here
,
''
continued
her
mother
,
with
more
hesitation
,
``
that
I
*NL*
last
saw
the
relation
we
are
going
to
look
for
--
Mr.
Michael
Henchard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
his
exact
kin
to
us
,
mother
?
I
have
never
clearly
had
it
told
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
,
or
was
--
for
he
may
be
dead
--
a
connection
by
marriage
,
''
said
her
*NL*
mother
deliberately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
you
have
said
a
score
of
times
before
!
''
replied
the
*NL*
young
woman
,
looking
about
her
inattentively
.
``
He
's
not
a
near
relation
,
*NL*
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
by
any
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
hay-trusser
,
was
n't
he
,
when
you
last
heard
of
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
never
knew
me
?
''
the
girl
innocently
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Henchard
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
answered
un-easily
,
``
Of
course
*NL*
not
,
Elizabeth-Jane
.
But
come
this
way
.
''
She
moved
on
to
another
part
of
*NL*
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
much
use
inquiring
here
for
anybody
,
I
should
think
,
''
the
*NL*
daughter
observed
,
as
she
gazed
round
about
.
``
People
at
fairs
change
*NL*
like
the
leaves
of
trees
;
and
I
daresay
you
are
the
only
one
here
to-day
*NL*
who
was
here
all
those
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
so
sure
of
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Newson
,
as
she
now
called
herself
,
*NL*
keenly
eyeing
something
under
a
green
bank
a
little
way
off
.
``
See
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
daughter
looked
in
the
direction
signified
.
The
object
pointed
*NL*
out
was
a
tripod
of
sticks
stuck
into
the
earth
,
from
which
hung
a
*NL*
three-legged
crock
,
kept
hot
by
a
smouldering
wood
fire
beneath
.
Over
*NL*
the
pot
stooped
an
old
woman
haggard
,
wrinkled
,
and
almost
in
rags
.
She
*NL*
stirred
the
contents
of
the
pot
with
a
large
spoon
,
and
occasionally
*NL*
croaked
in
a
broken
voice
,
``
Good
furmity
sold
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
the
former
mistress
of
the
furmity
tent
--
once
thriving
,
*NL*
cleanly
,
white-aproned
,
and
chinking
with
money
--
now
tentless
,
dirty
,
*NL*
owning
no
tables
or
benches
,
and
having
scarce
any
customers
except
*NL*
two
small
whity-brown
boys
,
who
came
up
and
asked
for
``
A
ha
`
p
`
orth
,
*NL*
please
--
good
measure
,
''
which
she
served
in
a
couple
of
chipped
yellow
*NL*
basins
of
commonest
clay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
here
at
that
time
,
''
resumed
Mrs.
Newson
,
making
a
step
as
if
to
*NL*
draw
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
to
her
--
it
is
n't
respectable
!
''
urged
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
just
say
a
word
--
you
,
Elizabeth-Jane
,
can
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
was
not
loth
,
and
turned
to
some
stalls
of
coloured
prints
*NL*
while
her
mother
went
forward
.
The
old
woman
begged
for
the
latter
's
*NL*
custom
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
,
and
responded
to
Mrs.
Henchard-Newson
's
*NL*
request
for
a
pennyworth
with
more
alacrity
than
she
had
shown
in
*NL*
selling
six-pennyworths
in
her
younger
days
.
When
the
soi-disant
widow
*NL*
had
taken
the
basin
of
thin
poor
slop
that
stood
for
the
rich
concoction
*NL*
of
the
former
time
,
the
hag
opened
a
little
basket
behind
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
looking
up
slily
,
whispered
,
``
Just
a
thought
o
'
rum
in
it
?
--
smuggled
,
*NL*
you
know
--
say
two
penn
`
orth
--
`
twill
make
it
slip
down
like
cordial
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
customer
smiled
bitterly
at
this
survival
of
the
old
trick
,
and
*NL*
shook
her
head
with
a
meaning
the
old
woman
was
far
from
translating
.
*NL*
She
pretended
to
eat
a
little
of
the
furmity
with
the
leaden
spoon
*NL*
offered
,
and
as
she
did
so
said
blandly
to
the
hag
,
``
You
've
seen
better
*NL*
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ma'am
--
well
ye
may
say
it
!
''
responded
the
old
woman
,
opening
the
*NL*
sluices
of
her
heart
forthwith
.
``
I
've
stood
in
this
fair-ground
,
maid
,
*NL*
wife
,
and
widow
,
these
nine-and-thirty
years
,
and
in
that
time
have
*NL*
known
what
it
was
to
do
business
with
the
richest
stomachs
in
the
*NL*
land
!
Ma'am
you
'd
hardly
believe
that
I
was
once
the
owner
of
a
great
*NL*
pavilion-tent
that
was
the
attraction
of
the
fair
.
Nobody
could
come
,
*NL*
nobody
could
go
,
without
having
a
dish
of
Mrs.
Goodenough
's
furmity
.
*NL*
I
knew
the
clergy
's
taste
,
the
dandy
gent
's
taste
;
I
knew
the
town
's
*NL*
taste
,
the
country
's
taste
.
I
even
knowed
the
taste
of
the
coarse
*NL*
shameless
females
.
But
Lord
's
my
life
--
the
world
's
no
memory
;
*NL*
straightforward
dealings
do
n't
bring
profit
--
't
is
the
sly
and
the
*NL*
underhand
that
get
on
in
these
times
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Newson
glanced
round
--
her
daughter
was
still
bending
over
the
*NL*
distant
stalls
.
``
Can
you
call
to
mind
,
''
she
said
cautiously
to
the
old
*NL*
woman
,
``
the
sale
of
a
wife
by
her
husband
in
your
tent
eighteen
years
*NL*
ago
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hag
reflected
,
and
half
shook
her
head
.
``
If
it
had
been
a
big
*NL*
thing
I
should
have
minded
it
in
a
moment
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
can
mind
every
*NL*
serious
fight
o
'
married
parties
,
every
murder
,
every
manslaughter
,
even
*NL*
every
pocket-picking
--
leastwise
large
ones
--
that
'
t
has
been
my
lot
to
*NL*
witness
.
But
a
selling
?
Was
it
done
quiet-like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
.
I
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
furmity
woman
half
shook
her
head
again
.
``
And
yet
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
do
.
*NL*
At
any
rate
,
I
can
mind
a
man
doing
something
o

the
sort

a
man
in
a
*NL*
cord
jacket
,
with
a
basket
of
tools

Lord
bless
ye
,
we
do
n't
gi'e

it

we
do
n't

such
as
that

The
only
reason
why
I
can
mind
the
*NL*
man
is
that
he
came
back
here
to
the
next
year
's
fair
,
and
told
me
quite
*NL*
private-like
that
if
a

ever
asked
for

I
was
to
say
he
had
gone
*NL*
to

where

Casterbridge

yes

to
Casterbridge

said
he
.
But
,
Lord
's
my

life

I
should

thought
of
it
again

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Newson
would
have
rewarded
the
old
woman
as
far
as
her
small
*NL*
means
afforded
had
she
not
discreetly
borne
in
mind
that
it
was
by
that
*NL*
unscrupulous
person
's
liquor
her
husband
had
been
degraded
.
She
briefly
*NL*
thanked
her
informant
,
and
rejoined
Elizabeth
,
who
greeted
her
with
,
*NL*
``
Mother
,
do
let

get
on

it
was
hardly
respectable
for
you
to
buy

there

none

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
learned
what
I
wanted

said
her
mother
quietly
.

is
a
long
,
long
way
from
here
,
and
it
was
many
years
*NL*
ago
that
he
said
it
,
but
there
I
think
we
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
they
descended
out
of
the
fair
,
and
went
onward
to
the
*NL*
village
,
where
they
obtained
a
night
's
lodging
.

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
wife
acted
for
the
best
,
but
she
had
involved
herself
in
*NL*
difficulties
.
A
hundred
times
she
had
been
upon
the
point
of
telling
her
*NL*
daughter
Elizabeth-Jane
the
true
story
of
her
life
,
the
tragical
crisis
*NL*
of
which
had
been
the
transaction
at
Weydon
Fair
,
when
she
was
not
much
*NL*
older
than
the
girl
now
beside
her
.
But
she
had
refrained
.
An
innocent
*NL*
maiden
had
thus
grown
up
in
the
belief
that
the
relations
between
the
*NL*
genial
sailor
and
her
mother
were
the
ordinary
ones
that
they
had
always
*NL*
appeared
to
be
.
The
risk
of
endangering
a
child
's
strong
affection
by
*NL*
disturbing
ideas
which
had
grown
with
her
growth
was
to
Mrs.
Henchard
*NL*
too
fearful
a
thing
to
contemplate
.
It
had
seemed
,
indeed
folly
to
think
*NL*
of
making
Elizabeth-Jane
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Susan
Henchard
's
fear
of
losing
her
dearly
loved
daughter
's
heart
by
*NL*
a
revelation
had
little
to
do
with
any
sense
of
wrong-doing
on
her
own
*NL*
part
.
Her
simplicity
--
the
original
ground
of
Henchard
's
contempt
for
*NL*
her
--
had
allowed
her
to
live
on
in
the
conviction
that
Newson
*NL*
had
acquired
a
morally
real
and
justifiable
right
to
her
by
his
*NL*
purchase
--
though
the
exact
bearings
and
legal
limits
of
that
right
were
*NL*
vague
.
It
may
seem
strange
to
sophisticated
minds
that
a
sane
young
*NL*
matron
could
believe
in
the
seriousness
of
such
a
transfer
;
and
were
*NL*
there
not
numerous
other
instances
of
the
same
belief
the
thing
might
*NL*
scarcely
be
credited
.
But
she
was
by
no
means
the
first
or
last
peasant
*NL*
woman
who
had
religiously
adhered
to
her
purchaser
,
as
too
many
rural
*NL*
records
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
of
Susan
Henchard
's
adventures
in
the
interim
can
be
told
*NL*
in
two
or
three
sentences
.
Absolutely
helpless
she
had
been
taken
off
*NL*
to
Canada
where
they
had
lived
several
years
without
any
great
worldly
*NL*
success
,
though
she
worked
as
hard
as
any
woman
could
to
keep
their
*NL*
cottage
cheerful
and
well-provided
.
When
Elizabeth-Jane
was
about
twelve
*NL*
years
old
the
three
returned
to
England
,
and
settled
at
Falmouth
,
*NL*
where
Newson
made
a
living
for
a
few
years
as
boatman
and
general
handy
*NL*
shoreman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
engaged
in
the
Newfoundland
trade
,
and
it
was
during
this
period
*NL*
that
Susan
had
an
awakening
.
A
friend
to
whom
she
confided
her
history
*NL*
ridiculed
her
grave
acceptance
of
her
position
;
and
all
was
over
with
*NL*
her
peace
of
mind
.
When
Newson
came
home
at
the
end
of
one
winter
he
saw
*NL*
that
the
delusion
he
had
so
carefully
sustained
had
vanished
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
then
a
time
of
sadness
,
in
which
she
told
him
her
doubts
*NL*
if
she
could
live
with
him
longer
.
Newson
left
home
again
on
the
*NL*
Newfoundland
trade
when
the
season
came
round
.
The
vague
news
of
his
*NL*
loss
at
sea
a
little
later
on
solved
a
problem
which
had
become
torture
*NL*
to
her
meek
conscience
.
She
saw
him
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Henchard
they
heard
nothing
.
To
the
liege
subjects
of
Labour
,
the
*NL*
England
of
those
days
was
a
continent
,
and
a
mile
a
geographical
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
developed
early
into
womanliness
.
One
day
a
month
or
*NL*
so
after
receiving
intelligence
of
Newson
's
death
off
the
Bank
of
*NL*
Newfoundland
,
when
the
girl
was
about
eighteen
,
she
was
sitting
on
a
*NL*
willow
chair
in
the
cottage
they
still
occupied
,
working
twine
nets
for
*NL*
the
fishermen
.
Her
mother
was
in
a
back
corner
of
the
same
room
engaged
*NL*
in
the
same
labour
,
and
dropping
the
heavy
wood
needle
she
was
filling
*NL*
she
surveyed
her
daughter
thoughtfully
.
The
sun
shone
in
at
the
door
*NL*
upon
the
young
woman
's
head
and
hair
,
which
was
worn
loose
,
so
that
the
*NL*
rays
streamed
into
its
depths
as
into
a
hazel
copse
.
Her
face
,
though
*NL*
somewhat
wan
and
incomplete
,
possessed
the
raw
materials
of
beauty
in
a
*NL*
promising
degree
.
There
was
an
under-handsomeness
in
it
,
struggling
*NL*
to
reveal
itself
through
the
provisional
curves
of
immaturity
,
and
the
*NL*
casual
disfigurements
that
resulted
from
the
straitened
circumstances
of
*NL*
their
lives
.
She
was
handsome
in
the
bone
,
hardly
as
yet
handsome
in
the
*NL*
flesh
.
She
possibly
might
never
be
fully
handsome
,
unless
the
carking
*NL*
accidents
of
her
daily
existence
could
be
evaded
before
the
mobile
parts
*NL*
of
her
countenance
had
settled
to
their
final
mould
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
girl
made
her
mother
sad
--
not
vaguely
but
by
logical
*NL*
inference
.
They
both
were
still
in
that
strait-waistcoat
of
poverty
from
*NL*
which
she
had
tried
so
many
times
to
be
delivered
for
the
girl
's
sake
.
*NL*
The
woman
had
long
perceived
how
zealously
and
constantly
the
young
mind
*NL*
of
her
companion
was
struggling
for
enlargement
;
and
yet
now
,
in
*NL*
her
eighteenth
year
,
it
still
remained
but
little
unfolded
.
The
*NL*
desire
--
sober
and
repressed
--
of
Elizabeth-Jane
's
heart
was
indeed
to
*NL*
see
,
to
hear
,
and
to
understand
.
How
could
she
become
a
woman
of
wider
*NL*
knowledge
,
higher
repute
--
``
better
,
''
as
she
termed
it
--
this
was
her
*NL*
constant
inquiry
of
her
mother
.
She
sought
further
into
things
than
*NL*
other
girls
in
her
position
ever
did
,
and
her
mother
groaned
as
she
felt
*NL*
she
could
not
aid
in
the
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
,
drowned
or
no
,
was
probably
now
lost
to
them
;
and
Susan
's
*NL*
staunch
,
religious
adherence
to
him
as
her
husband
in
principle
,
till
*NL*
her
views
had
been
disturbed
by
enlightenment
,
was
demanded
no
more
.
She
*NL*
asked
herself
whether
the
present
moment
,
now
that
she
was
a
free
woman
*NL*
again
,
were
not
as
opportune
a
one
as
she
would
find
in
a
world
where
*NL*
everything
had
been
so
inopportune
,
for
making
a
desperate
effort
to
*NL*
advance
Elizabeth
.
To
pocket
her
pride
and
search
for
the
first
husband
*NL*
seemed
,
wisely
or
not
,
the
best
initiatory
step
.
He
had
possibly
drunk
*NL*
himself
into
his
tomb
.
But
he
might
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
had
too
*NL*
much
sense
to
do
so
;
for
in
her
time
with
him
he
had
been
given
to
bouts
*NL*
only
,
and
was
not
a
habitual
drunkard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
,
the
propriety
of
returning
to
him
,
if
he
lived
,
was
*NL*
unquestionable
.
The
awkwardness
of
searching
for
him
lay
in
enlightening
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
a
proceeding
which
her
mother
could
not
endure
to
*NL*
contemplate
.
She
finally
resolved
to
undertake
the
search
without
*NL*
confiding
to
the
girl
her
former
relations
with
Henchard
,
leaving
it
to
*NL*
him
if
they
found
him
to
take
what
steps
he
might
choose
to
that
*NL*
end
.
This
will
account
for
their
conversation
at
the
fair
and
the
*NL*
half-informed
state
at
which
Elizabeth
was
led
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
attitude
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
,
trusting
solely
to
the
*NL*
dim
light
afforded
of
Henchard
's
whereabouts
by
the
furmity
woman
.
The
*NL*
strictest
economy
was
indispensable
.
Sometimes
they
might
have
been
seen
*NL*
on
foot
,
sometimes
on
farmers
'
waggons
,
sometimes
in
carriers
'
vans
;
and
*NL*
thus
they
drew
near
to
Casterbridge
.
Elizabeth-Jane
discovered
to
her
*NL*
alarm
that
her
mother
's
health
was
not
what
it
once
had
been
,
and
there
*NL*
was
ever
and
anon
in
her
talk
that
renunciatory
tone
which
showed
that
,
*NL*
but
for
the
girl
,
she
would
not
be
very
sorry
to
quit
a
life
she
was
*NL*
growing
thoroughly
weary
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
Friday
evening
,
near
the
middle
of
September
and
just
before
*NL*
dusk
,
that
they
reached
the
summit
of
a
hill
within
a
mile
of
the
place
*NL*
they
sought
.
There
were
high
banked
hedges
to
the
coach-road
here
,
*NL*
and
they
mounted
upon
the
green
turf
within
,
and
sat
down
.
The
spot
*NL*
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
town
and
its
environs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
old-fashioned
place
it
seems
to
be
!
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
,
while
*NL*
her
silent
mother
mused
on
other
things
than
topography
.
``
It
is
huddled
*NL*
all
together
;
and
it
is
shut
in
by
a
square
wall
of
trees
,
like
a
plot
*NL*
of
garden
ground
by
a
box-edging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Its
squareness
was
,
indeed
,
the
characteristic
which
most
struck
the
eye
*NL*
in
this
antiquated
borough
,
the
borough
of
Casterbridge
--
at
that
time
,
*NL*
recent
as
it
was
,
untouched
by
the
faintest
sprinkle
of
modernism
.
It
*NL*
was
compact
as
a
box
of
dominoes
.
It
had
no
suburbs
--
in
the
ordinary
*NL*
sense
.
Country
and
town
met
at
a
mathematical
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
birds
of
the
more
soaring
kind
Casterbridge
must
have
appeared
on
*NL*
this
fine
evening
as
a
mosaic-work
of
subdued
reds
,
browns
,
greys
,
and
*NL*
crystals
,
held
together
by
a
rectangular
frame
of
deep
green
.
To
the
*NL*
level
eye
of
humanity
it
stood
as
an
indistinct
mass
behind
a
dense
*NL*
stockade
of
limes
and
chestnuts
,
set
in
the
midst
of
miles
of
rotund
*NL*
down
and
concave
field
.
The
mass
became
gradually
dissected
by
the
*NL*
vision
into
towers
,
gables
,
chimneys
,
and
casements
,
the
highest
*NL*
glazings
shining
bleared
and
bloodshot
with
the
coppery
fire
they
caught
*NL*
from
the
belt
of
sunlit
cloud
in
the
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
centre
of
each
side
of
this
tree-bound
square
ran
avenues
*NL*
east
,
west
,
and
south
into
the
wide
expanse
of
cornland
and
coomb
to
*NL*
the
distance
of
a
mile
or
so
.
It
was
by
one
of
these
avenues
that
the
*NL*
pedestrians
were
about
to
enter
.
Before
they
had
risen
to
proceed
two
*NL*
men
passed
outside
the
hedge
,
engaged
in
argumentative
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
surely
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
as
they
receded
,
``
those
men
mentioned
the
*NL*
name
of
Henchard
in
their
talk
--
the
name
of
our
relative
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
too
,
''
said
Mrs.
Newson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
seems
a
hint
to
us
that
he
is
still
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
run
after
them
,
and
ask
them
about
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
Not
for
the
world
just
yet
.
He
may
be
in
the
workhouse
,
or
*NL*
in
the
stocks
,
for
all
we
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
--
why
should
you
think
that
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
just
something
to
say
--
that
's
all
!
But
we
must
make
private
*NL*
inquiries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
sufficiently
rested
they
proceeded
on
their
way
at
evenfall
.
The
*NL*
dense
trees
of
the
avenue
rendered
the
road
dark
as
a
tunnel
,
though
the
*NL*
open
land
on
each
side
was
still
under
a
faint
daylight
,
in
other
words
,
*NL*
they
passed
down
a
midnight
between
two
gloamings
.
The
features
of
the
*NL*
town
had
a
keen
interest
for
Elizabeth
's
mother
,
now
that
the
human
side
*NL*
came
to
the
fore
.
As
soon
as
they
had
wandered
about
they
could
see
that
*NL*
the
stockade
of
gnarled
trees
which
framed
in
Casterbridge
was
itself
*NL*
an
avenue
,
standing
on
a
low
green
bank
or
escarpment
,
with
a
ditch
*NL*
yet
visible
without
.
Within
the
avenue
and
bank
was
a
wall
more
or
*NL*
less
discontinuous
,
and
within
the
wall
were
packed
the
abodes
of
the
*NL*
burghers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
two
women
did
not
know
it
these
external
features
were
but
*NL*
the
ancient
defences
of
the
town
,
planted
as
a
promenade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lamplights
now
glimmered
through
the
engirdling
trees
,
conveying
a
*NL*
sense
of
great
smugness
and
comfort
inside
,
and
rendering
at
the
same
*NL*
time
the
unlighted
country
without
strangely
solitary
and
vacant
in
*NL*
aspect
,
considering
its
nearness
to
life
.
The
difference
between
burgh
*NL*
and
champaign
was
increased
,
too
,
by
sounds
which
now
reached
them
above
*NL*
others
--
the
notes
of
a
brass
band
.
The
travellers
returned
into
the
High
*NL*
Street
,
where
there
were
timber
houses
with
overhanging
stories
,
*NL*
whose
small-paned
lattices
were
screened
by
dimity
curtains
on
a
*NL*
drawing-string
,
and
under
whose
bargeboards
old
cobwebs
waved
in
the
*NL*
breeze
.
There
were
houses
of
brick-nogging
,
which
derived
their
chief
*NL*
support
from
those
adjoining
.
There
were
slate
roofs
patched
with
tiles
,
*NL*
and
tile
roofs
patched
with
slate
,
with
occasionally
a
roof
of
thatch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
agricultural
and
pastoral
character
of
the
people
upon
whom
the
town
*NL*
depended
for
its
existence
was
shown
by
the
class
of
objects
displayed
*NL*
in
the
shop
windows
.
Scythes
,
reap-hooks
,
sheep-shears
,
bill-hooks
,
*NL*
spades
,
mattocks
,
and
hoes
at
the
iron-monger
's
;
bee-hives
,
*NL*
butter-firkins
,
churns
,
milking
stools
and
pails
,
hay-rakes
,
*NL*
field-flagons
,
and
seed-lips
at
the
cooper
's
;
cart-ropes
and
*NL*
plough-harness
at
the
saddler

;
carts
,
wheel-barrows
,
and
mill-gear
at
*NL*
the
wheelwright

and
machinist

horse-embrocations
at
the
chemist

pattens
and
clogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
to
a
grizzled
church
,
whose
massive
square
tower
rose
unbroken
*NL*
into
the
darkening
sky
,
the
lower
parts
being
illuminated
by
the
nearest
*NL*
lamps
sufficiently
to
show
how
completely
the
mortar
from
the
joints
*NL*
of
the
stonework
had
been
nibbled
out
by
time
and
weather
,
which
had
*NL*
planted
in
the
crevices
thus
made
little
tufts
of
stone-crop
and
grass
*NL*
almost
as
far
up
as
the
very
battlements
.
From
this
tower
the
clock
*NL*
struck
eight
,
and
thereupon
a
bell
began
to
toll
with
a
peremptory
*NL*
clang
.
The
curfew
was
still
rung
in
Casterbridge
,
and
it
was
utilized
by
*NL*
the
inhabitants
as
a
signal
for
shutting
their
shops
.
No
sooner
did
the
*NL*
deep
notes
of
the
bell
throb
between
the
house-fronts
than
a
clatter
*NL*
of
shutters
arose
through
the
whole
length
of
the
High
Street
.
In
a
few
*NL*
minutes
business
at
Casterbridge
was
ended
for
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
clocks
struck
eight
from
time
to
time
--
one
gloomily
from
the
gaol
,
*NL*
another
from
the
gable
of
an
almshouse
,
with
a
preparative
creak
of
*NL*
machinery
,
more
audible
than
the
note
of
the
bell
;
a
row
of
tall
,
*NL*
varnished
case-clocks
from
the
interior
of
a
clock-maker
's
shop
joined
*NL*
in
one
after
another
just
as
the
shutters
were
enclosing
them
,
like
a
*NL*
row
of
actors
delivering
their
final
speeches
before
the
fall
of
the
*NL*
curtain
;
then
chimes
were
heard
stammering
out
the
Sicilian
Mariners
'
*NL*
Hymn
;
so
that
chronologists
of
the
advanced
school
were
appreciably
on
*NL*
their
way
to
the
next
hour
before
the
whole
business
of
the
old
one
was
*NL*
satisfactorily
wound
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
open
space
before
the
church
walked
a
woman
with
her
gown-sleeves
*NL*
rolled
up
so
high
that
the
edge
of
her
underlinen
was
visible
,
and
her
*NL*
skirt
tucked
up
through
her
pocket
hole
.
She
carried
a
load
under
her
*NL*
arm
from
which
she
was
pulling
pieces
of
bread
,
and
handing
them
to
some
*NL*
other
women
who
walked
with
her
,
which
pieces
they
nibbled
critically
.
*NL*
The
sight
reminded
Mrs.
Henchard-Newson
and
her
daughter
that
they
had
*NL*
an
appetite
;
and
they
inquired
of
the
woman
for
the
nearest
baker
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
may
as
well
look
for
manna-food
as
good
bread
in
Casterbridge
just
*NL*
now
,
''
she
said
,
after
directing
them
.
``
They
can
blare
their
trumpets
*NL*
and
thump
their
drums
,
and
have
their
roaring
dinners
''
--
waving
her
hand
*NL*
towards
a
point
further
along
the
street
,
where
the
brass
band
could
be
*NL*
seen
standing
in
front
of
an
illuminated
building
--
``
but
we
must
needs
be
*NL*
put-to
for
want
of
a
wholesome
crust
.
There
's
less
good
bread
than
good
*NL*
beer
in
Casterbridge
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
less
good
beer
than
swipes
,
''
said
a
man
with
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
it
happen
there
's
no
good
bread
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
't
is
the
corn-factor
--
he
's
the
man
that
our
millers
and
bakers
all
*NL*
deal
wi
'
,
and
he
has
sold
'em
growed
wheat
,
which
they
did
n't
know
*NL*
was
growed
,
so
they
SAY
,
till
the
dough
ran
all
over
the
ovens
like
*NL*
quicksilver
;
so
that
the
loaves
be
as
flat
as
toads
,
and
like
suet
*NL*
pudden
inside
.
I
've
been
a
wife
,
and
I
've
been
a
mother
,
and
I
never
see
*NL*
such
unprincipled
bread
in
Casterbridge
as
this
before
.
--
But
you
must
be
*NL*
a
real
stranger
here
not
to
know
what
's
made
all
the
poor
volks

insides
*NL*
plim
like
blowed
bladders
this
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
Elizabeth
's
mother
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
wishing
to
be
observed
further
till
she
knew
more
of
her
future
*NL*
in
this
place
,
she
withdrew
with
her
daughter
from
the
speaker
's
side
.
*NL*
Getting
a
couple
of
biscuits
at
the
shop
indicated
as
a
temporary
*NL*
substitute
for
a
meal
,
they
next
bent
their
steps
instinctively
to
where
*NL*
the
music
was
playing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
5
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
score
yards
brought
them
to
the
spot
where
the
town
band
was
now
*NL*
shaking
the
window-panes
with
the
strains
of
``
The
Roast
Beef
of
Old
*NL*
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
building
before
whose
doors
they
had
pitched
their
music-stands
was
*NL*
the
chief
hotel
in
Casterbridge
--
namely
,
the
King
's
Arms
.
A
spacious
*NL*
bow-window
projected
into
the
street
over
the
main
portico
,
and
from
the
*NL*
open
sashes
came
the
babble
of
voices
,
the
jingle
of
glasses
,
and
the
*NL*
drawing
of
corks
.
The
blinds
,
moreover
,
being
left
unclosed
,
the
whole
*NL*
interior
of
this
room
could
be
surveyed
from
the
top
of
a
flight
of
*NL*
stone
steps
to
the
road-waggon
office
opposite
,
for
which
reason
a
knot
*NL*
of
idlers
had
gathered
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
make
a
few
inquiries
about
--
our
*NL*
relation
Mr.
Henchard
,
''
whispered
Mrs.
Newson
who
,
since
her
entry
*NL*
into
Casterbridge
,
had
seemed
strangely
weak
and
agitated
,
``
And
this
,
I
*NL*
think
,
would
be
a
good
place
for
trying
it
--
just
to
ask
,
you
know
,
*NL*
how
he
stands
in
the
town
--
if
he
is
here
,
as
I
think
he
must
be
.
You
,
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
had
better
be
the
one
to
do
it
.
I
'm
too
worn
out
to
do
*NL*
anything
--
pull
down
your
fall
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
upon
the
lowest
step
,
and
Elizabeth-Jane
obeyed
her
*NL*
directions
and
stood
among
the
idlers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
going
on
to-night
?
''
asked
the
girl
,
after
singling
out
an
old
*NL*
man
and
standing
by
him
long
enough
to
acquire
a
neighbourly
right
of
*NL*
converse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ye
must
be
a
stranger
sure
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
without
taking
*NL*
his
eyes
from
the
window
.
``
Why
,
't
is
a
great
public
dinner
of
the
*NL*
gentle-people
and
such
like
leading
volk
--
wi

the
Mayor
in
the
chair
.
As
*NL*
we
plainer
fellows
bai
n't
invited
,
they
leave
the
winder-shutters
open
*NL*
that
we
may
get
jist
a
sense
o

out
here
.
If
you
mount
the
steps

*NL*
can

That

Mr.
Henchard
,
the
Mayor
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
a
*NL*
facing
ye
;
and
that
's
the
Council
men
right
and
left
...
Ah
,
lots
of
them
*NL*
when
they
begun
life
were
no
more
than
I
be
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henchard
!
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
,
surprised
,
but
by
no
means
suspecting
*NL*
the
whole
force
of
the
revelation
.
She
ascended
to
the
top
of
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
,
though
her
head
was
bowed
,
had
already
caught
from
the
*NL*
inn-window
tones
that
strangely
riveted
her
attention
,
before
the
old
*NL*
man
's
words
,
``
Mr.
Henchard
,
the
Mayor
,
''
reached
her
ears
.
She
arose
,
*NL*
and
stepped
up
to
her
daughter
's
side
as
soon
as
she
could
do
so
without
*NL*
showing
exceptional
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
of
the
hotel
dining-room
was
spread
out
before
her
,
with
*NL*
its
tables
,
and
glass
,
and
plate
,
and
inmates
.
Facing
the
window
,
in
the
*NL*
chair
of
dignity
,
sat
a
man
about
forty
years
of
age
;
of
heavy
frame
,
*NL*
large
features
,
and
commanding
voice
;
his
general
build
being
rather
*NL*
coarse
than
compact
.
He
had
a
rich
complexion
,
which
verged
on
*NL*
swarthiness
,
a
flashing
black
eye
,
and
dark
,
bushy
brows
and
hair
.
When
*NL*
he
indulged
in
an
occasional
loud
laugh
at
some
remark
among
the
*NL*
guests
,
his
large
mouth
parted
so
far
back
as
to
show
to
the
rays
of
the
*NL*
chandelier
a
full
score
or
more
of
the
two-and-thirty
sound
white
teeth
*NL*
that
he
obviously
still
could
boast
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
laugh
was
not
encouraging
to
strangers
,
and
hence
it
may
have
been
*NL*
well
that
it
was
rarely
heard
.
Many
theories
might
have
been
built
upon
*NL*
it
.
It
fell
in
well
with
conjectures
of
a
temperament
which
would
have
*NL*
no
pity
for
weakness
,
but
would
be
ready
to
yield
ungrudging
admiration
*NL*
to
greatness
and
strength
.
Its
producer
's
personal
goodness
,
if
he
had
*NL*
any
,
would
be
of
a
very
fitful
cast
--
an
occasional
almost
oppressive
*NL*
generosity
rather
than
a
mild
and
constant
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Henchard
's
husband
--
in
law
,
at
least
--
sat
before
them
,
matured
*NL*
in
shape
,
stiffened
in
line
,
exaggerated
in
traits
;
disciplined
,
*NL*
thought-marked
--
in
a
word
,
older
.
Elizabeth
,
encumbered
with
no
*NL*
recollections
as
her
mother
was
,
regarded
him
with
nothing
more
than
*NL*
the
keen
curiosity
and
interest
which
the
discovery
of
such
unexpected
*NL*
social
standing
in
the
long-sought
relative
naturally
begot
.
He
was
*NL*
dressed
in
an
old-fashioned
evening
suit
,
an
expanse
of
frilled
shirt
*NL*
showing
on
his
broad
breast
;
jewelled
studs
,
and
a
heavy
gold
chain
.
*NL*
Three
glasses
stood
at
his
right
hand
;
but
,
to
his
wife
's
surprise
,
the
*NL*
two
for
wine
were
empty
,
while
the
third
,
a
tumbler
,
was
half
full
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
last
she
had
seen
him
he
was
sitting
in
a
corduroy
jacket
,
fustian
*NL*
waistcoat
and
breeches
,
and
tanned
leather
leggings
,
with
a
basin
of
hot
*NL*
furmity
before
him
.
Time
,
the
magician
,
had
wrought
much
here
.
Watching
*NL*
him
,
and
thus
thinking
of
past
days
,
she
became
so
moved
that
she
shrank
*NL*
back
against
the
jamb
of
the
waggon-office
doorway
to
which
the
steps
*NL*
gave
access
,
the
shadow
from
it
conveniently
hiding
her
features
.
She
*NL*
forgot
her
daughter
till
a
touch
from
Elizabeth-Jane
aroused
her
.
``
Have
*NL*
you
seen
him
,
mother
?
''
whispered
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
answered
her
companion
hastily
.
``
I
have
seen
him
,
and
it
is
*NL*
enough
for
me
!
Now
I
only
want
to
go
--
pass
away
--
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
O
what
?
''
She
drew
closer
,
and
whispered
in
her
mother
's
ear
,
``
Does
*NL*
he
seem
to
you
not
likely
to
befriend
us
?
I
thought
he
looked
a
generous
*NL*
man
.
What
a
gentleman
he
is
,
is
n't
he
?
and
how
his
diamond
studs
shine
!
*NL*
How
strange
that
you
should
have
said
he
might
be
in
the
stocks
,
or
in
*NL*
the
workhouse
,
or
dead
!
Did
ever
anything
go
more
by
contraries
!
Why
do
*NL*
you
feel
so
afraid
of
him
?
I
am
not
at
all
;
I
'll
call
upon
him
--
he
can
*NL*
but
say
he
do
n't
own
such
remote
kin

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
at
all

I
ca
n't
tell
what
to
set
about

feel
so
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
that

mother

now

have
got
here
and
all
!
Rest
there
where
*NL*
you
be
a
little
while
--
I
will
look
on
and
find
out
more
about
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
can
ever
meet
Mr.
Henchard
.
He
is
not
how
I
thought
he
*NL*
would
be
--
he
overpowers
me
!
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
him
any
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wait
a
little
time
and
consider

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
never
been
so
much
interested
in
anything
in
her
life
*NL*
as
in
their
present
position
,
partly
from
the
natural
elation
she
felt
*NL*
at
discovering
herself
akin
to
a
coach
;
and
she
gazed
again
at
the
*NL*
scene
.
The
younger
guests
were
talking
and
eating
with
animation
;
their
*NL*
elders
were
searching
for
titbits
,
and
sniffing
and
grunting
over
their
*NL*
plates
like
sows
nuzzling
for
acorns
.
Three
drinks
seemed
to
be
sacred
*NL*
to
the
company
--
port
,
sherry
,
and
rum
;
outside
which
old-established
*NL*
trinity
few
or
no
palates
ranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
row
of
ancient
rummers
with
ground
figures
on
their
sides
,
and
each
*NL*
primed
with
a
spoon
,
was
now
placed
down
the
table
,
and
these
were
*NL*
promptly
filled
with
grog
at
such
high
temperatures
as
to
raise
*NL*
serious
considerations
for
the
articles
exposed
to
its
vapours
.
But
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
noticed
that
,
though
this
filling
went
on
with
great
*NL*
promptness
up
and
down
the
table
,
nobody
filled
the
Mayor
's
glass
,
who
*NL*
still
drank
large
quantities
of
water
from
the
tumbler
behind
the
clump
*NL*
of
crystal
vessels
intended
for
wine
and
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
fill
Mr.
Henchard
's
wine-glasses
,
''
she
ventured
to
say
to
*NL*
her
elbow
acquaintance
,
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
;
do
n't
ye
know
him
to
be
the
celebrated
abstaining
worthy
of

He
scorns
all
tempting
liquors
;
never
touches
nothing
.
O
*NL*
yes
,
he
've
strong
qualities
that
way

I
have
heard
tell
that
he
sware
*NL*
a
gospel
oath
in
bygone
times
,
and
has
bode
by
it
ever
since

So
they
*NL*
do

press
him
,
knowing
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
the
face
of
that
:
for

gospel
oath

a
serious

*NL*
Another
elderly
man
,
hearing
this
discourse
,
now
joined
in
by
inquiring
,
*NL*
``
How
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
When

*NL*
``

Solomon

Longways
replied
with
terminative
emphasis
,
as
if
the
fact
of
his

ignorance
of
Mrs.

were
sufficient
to
deprive
her

of
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
many
men

then
?
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
!
Why
,
my
good
maid
,
he
's
the
powerfullest
member
of
the
Town
*NL*
Council
,
and
quite
a
principal
man
in
the
country
round
besides
.
Never
*NL*
a
big
dealing
in
wheat
,
barley
,
oats
,
hay
,
roots
,
and
such-like
but
*NL*
Henchard
's
got
a
hand
in
it
.
Ay
,
and
he
'll
go
into
other
things
too
;
*NL*
and
that
's
where
he
makes
his
mistake
.
He
worked
his
way
up
from
nothing
*NL*
when
'
a
came
here
;
and
now
he
's
a
pillar
of
the
town
.
Not
but
what
he
's
*NL*
been
shaken
a
little
to-year
about
this
bad
corn
he
has
supplied
in
*NL*
his
contracts
.
I
've
seen
the
sun
rise
over
Durnover
Moor
these
*NL*
nine-and-sixty
year
,
and
though
Mr.
Henchard
has
never
cussed
me
*NL*
unfairly
ever
since
I
've
worked
for
`
n
,
seeing
I
be
but
a
little
small
*NL*
man
,
I
must
say
that
I
have
never
before
tasted
such
rough
bread
as
has
*NL*
been
made
from
Henchard
's
wheat
lately
.
'T
is
that
growed
out
that
ye
*NL*
could
a
`
most
call
it
malt
,
and
there
's
a
list
at
bottom
o
'
the
loaf
as
*NL*
thick
as
the
sole
of
one
's
shoe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
band
now
struck
up
another
melody
,
and
by
the
time
it
was
ended
the
*NL*
dinner
was
over
,
and
speeches
began
to
be
made
.
The
evening
being
calm
,
*NL*
and
the
windows
still
open
,
these
orations
could
be
distinctly
heard
.
*NL*
Henchard
's
voice
arose
above
the
rest
;
he
was
telling
a
story
of
his
*NL*
hay-dealing
experiences
,
in
which
he
had
outwitted
a
sharper
who
had
*NL*
been
bent
upon
outwitting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha-ha-ha
!
''
responded
his
audience
at
the
upshot
of
the
story
;
and
*NL*
hilarity
was
general
till
a
new
voice
arose
with
,
``
This
is
all
very
*NL*
well
;
but
how
about
the
bad
bread
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
from
the
lower
end
of
the
table
,
where
there
sat
a
group
of
*NL*
minor
tradesmen
who
,
although
part
of
the
company
,
appeared
to
be
a
*NL*
little
below
the
social
level
of
the
others
;
and
who
seemed
to
nourish
*NL*
a
certain
independence
of
opinion
and
carry
on
discussions
not
quite
*NL*
in
harmony
with
those
at
the
head
;
just
as
the
west
end
of
a
church
*NL*
is
sometimes
persistently
found
to
sing
out
of
time
and
tune
with
the
*NL*
leading
spirits
in
the
chancel
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
interruption
about
the
bad
bread
afforded
infinite
satisfaction
to
*NL*
the
loungers
outside
,
several
of
whom
were
in
the
mood
which
finds
its
*NL*
pleasure
in
others
'
discomfiture
;
and
hence
they
echoed
pretty
freely
,
*NL*
``
Hey
!
How
about
the
bad
bread
,
Mr.
Mayor
?
''
Moreover
,
feeling
none
of
the
*NL*
restraints
of
those
who
shared
the
feast
,
they
could
afford
to
add
,
``
You
*NL*
rather
ought
to
tell
the
story
o
'
that
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
interruption
was
sufficient
to
compel
the
Mayor
to
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
admit
that
the
wheat
turned
out
badly
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
I
was
*NL*
taken
in
in
buying
it
as
much
as
the
bakers
who
bought
it
o
'
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
poor
folk
who
had
to
eat
it
whether
or
no
,
''
said
the
*NL*
inharmonious
man
outside
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
face
darkened
.
There
was
temper
under
the
thin
bland
*NL*
surface
--
the
temper
which
,
artificially
intensified
,
had
banished
a
wife
*NL*
nearly
a
score
of
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
make
allowances
for
the
accidents
of
a
large
business
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
You
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
weather
just
at
the
harvest
of
*NL*
that
corn
was
worse
than
we
have
known
it
for
years
.
However
,
I
have
*NL*
mended
my
arrangements
on
account
o
`
t
.
Since
I
have
found
my
business
*NL*
too
large
to
be
well
looked
after
by
myself
alone
,
I
have
advertised
for
*NL*
a
thorough
good
man
as
manager
of
the
corn
department
.
When
I
've
got
*NL*
him
you
will
find
these
mistakes
will
no
longer
occur
--
matters
will
be
*NL*
better
looked
into
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
repay
us
for
the
past
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
man
who
had
before
spoken
,
and
who
seemed
to
be
a
baker
or
miller
.
``
Will
*NL*
you
replace
the
grown
flour
we
've
still
got
by
sound
grain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
face
had
become
still
more
stern
at
these
interruptions
,
and
*NL*
he
drank
from
his
tumbler
of
water
as
if
to
calm
himself
or
gain
time
.
*NL*
Instead
of
vouchsafing
a
direct
reply
,
he
stiffly
observed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
anybody
will
tell
me
how
to
turn
grown
wheat
into
wholesome
wheat
*NL*
I
'll
take
it
back
with
pleasure
.
But
it
ca
n't
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
was
not
to
be
drawn
again
.
Having
said
this
,
he
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
6
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
group
outside
the
window
had
within
the
last
few
minutes
been
*NL*
reinforced
by
new
arrivals
,
some
of
them
respectable
shopkeepers
and
*NL*
their
assistants
,
who
had
come
out
for
a
whiff
of
air
after
putting
up
*NL*
the
shutters
for
the
night
;
some
of
them
of
a
lower
class
.
Distinct
from
*NL*
either
there
appeared
a
stranger
--
a
young
man
of
remarkably
pleasant
*NL*
aspect
--
who
carried
in
his
hand
a
carpet-bag
of
the
smart
floral
pattern
*NL*
prevalent
in
such
articles
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
ruddy
and
of
a
fair
countenance
,
bright-eyed
,
and
slight
in
*NL*
build
.
He
might
possibly
have
passed
by
without
stopping
at
all
,
or
at
*NL*
most
for
half
a
minute
to
glance
in
at
the
scene
,
had
not
his
advent
*NL*
coincided
with
the
discussion
on
corn
and
bread
,
in
which
event
this
*NL*
history
had
never
been
enacted
.
But
the
subject
seemed
to
arrest
him
,
*NL*
and
he
whispered
some
inquiries
of
the
other
bystanders
,
and
remained
*NL*
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
heard
Henchard
's
closing
words
,
``
It
ca
n't
be
done
,
''
he
smiled
*NL*
impulsively
,
drew
out
his
pocketbook
,
and
wrote
down
a
few
words
by
*NL*
the
aid
of
the
light
in
the
window
.
He
tore
out
the
leaf
,
folded
and
*NL*
directed
it
,
and
seemed
about
to
throw
it
in
through
the
open
sash
upon
*NL*
the
dining-table
;
but
,
on
second
thoughts
,
edged
himself
through
the
*NL*
loiterers
,
till
he
reached
the
door
of
the
hotel
,
where
one
of
the
*NL*
waiters
who
had
been
serving
inside
was
now
idly
leaning
against
the
*NL*
doorpost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
this
to
the
Mayor
at
once
,
''
he
said
,
handing
in
his
hasty
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
seen
his
movements
and
heard
the
words
,
which
*NL*
attracted
her
both
by
their
subject
and
by
their
accent
--
a
strange
one
*NL*
for
those
parts
.
It
was
quaint
and
northerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
took
the
note
,
while
the
young
stranger
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
ye
tell
me
of
a
respectable
hotel
that
's
a
little
more
moderate
*NL*
than
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
glanced
indifferently
up
and
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
the
Three
Mariners
,
just
below
here
,
is
a
very
good
place
,
''
he
*NL*
languidly
answered
;
``
but
I
have
never
stayed
there
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Scotchman
,
as
he
seemed
to
be
,
thanked
him
,
and
strolled
on
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
Three
Mariners
aforesaid
,
apparently
more
concerned
*NL*
about
the
question
of
an
inn
than
about
the
fate
of
his
note
,
now
that
*NL*
the
momentary
impulse
of
writing
it
was
over
.
While
he
was
disappearing
*NL*
slowly
down
the
street
the
waiter
left
the
door
,
and
Elizabeth-Jane
saw
*NL*
with
some
interest
the
note
brought
into
the
dining-room
and
handed
to
*NL*
the
Mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
looked
at
it
carelessly
,
unfolded
it
with
one
hand
,
and
glanced
*NL*
it
through
.
Thereupon
it
was
curious
to
note
an
unexpected
effect
.
The
*NL*
nettled
,
clouded
aspect
which
had
held
possession
of
his
face
since
the
*NL*
subject
of
his
corn-dealings
had
been
broached
,
changed
itself
into
one
*NL*
of
arrested
attention
.
He
read
the
note
slowly
,
and
fell
into
thought
,
*NL*
not
moody
,
but
fitfully
intense
,
as
that
of
a
man
who
has
been
captured
*NL*
by
an
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
toasts
and
speeches
had
given
place
to
songs
,
the
wheat
*NL*
subject
being
quite
forgotten
.
Men
were
putting
their
heads
together
in
*NL*
twos
and
threes
,
telling
good
stories
,
with
pantomimic
laughter
which
*NL*
reached
convulsive
grimace
.
Some
were
beginning
to
look
as
if
they
did
*NL*
not
know
how
they
had
come
there
,
what
they
had
come
for
,
or
how
they
*NL*
were
going
to
get
home
again
;
and
provisionally
sat
on
with
a
dazed
*NL*
smile
.
Square-built
men
showed
a
tendency
to
become
hunchbacks
;
men
with
*NL*
a
dignified
presence
lost
it
in
a
curious
obliquity
of
figure
,
in
which
*NL*
their
features
grew
disarranged
and
one-sided
,
whilst
the
heads
of
a
few
*NL*
who
had
dined
with
extreme
thoroughness
were
somehow
sinking
into
their
*NL*
shoulders
,
the
corners
of
their
mouth
and
eyes
being
bent
upwards
by
the
*NL*
subsidence
.
Only
Henchard
did
not
conform
to
these
flexuous
changes
;
he
*NL*
remained
stately
and
vertical
,
silently
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
struck
nine
.
Elizabeth-Jane
turned
to
her
companion
.
``
The
*NL*
evening
is
drawing
on
,
mother
,
''
she
said
.
``
What
do
you
propose
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
surprised
to
find
how
irresolute
her
mother
had
become
.
``
We
must
*NL*
get
a
place
to
lie
down
in
,
''
she
murmured
.
``
I
have
seen
--
Mr.
Henchard
;
*NL*
and
that
's
all
I
wanted
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
for
to-night
,
at
any
rate
,
''
Elizabeth-Jane
replied
*NL*
soothingly
.
``
We
can
think
to-morrow
what
is
best
to
do
about
him
.
The
*NL*
question
now
is
--
is
it
not
?
--
how
shall
we
find
a
lodging
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
her
mother
did
not
reply
Elizabeth-Jane
's
mind
reverted
to
the
words
*NL*
of
the
waiter
,
that
the
Three
Mariners
was
an
inn
of
moderate
charges
.
A
*NL*
recommendation
good
for
one
person
was
probably
good
for
another
.
``
Let
's
*NL*
go
where
the
young
man
has
gone
to
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
is
respectable
.
What
*NL*
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
assented
,
and
down
the
street
they
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
Mayor
's
thoughtfulness
,
engendered
by
the
note
as
*NL*
stated
,
continued
to
hold
him
in
abstraction
;
till
,
whispering
to
his
*NL*
neighbour
to
take
his
place
,
he
found
opportunity
to
leave
the
chair
.
*NL*
This
was
just
after
the
departure
of
his
wife
and
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
door
of
the
assembly-room
he
saw
the
waiter
,
and
beckoning
*NL*
to
him
asked
who
had
brought
the
note
which
had
been
handed
in
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
man
,
sir
--
a
sort
of
traveller
.
He
was
a
Scotchman
seemingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
say
how
he
had
got
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wrote
it
himself
,
sir
,
as
he
stood
outside
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
wrote
it
himself
...
Is
the
young
man
in
the
hotel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
He
went
to
the
Three
Mariners
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mayor
walked
up
and
down
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
with
his
hands
*NL*
under
his
coat
tails
,
as
if
he
were
merely
seeking
a
cooler
atmosphere
*NL*
than
that
of
the
room
he
had
quitted
.
But
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
*NL*
he
was
in
reality
still
possessed
to
the
full
by
the
new
idea
,
whatever
*NL*
that
might
be
.
At
length
he
went
back
to
the
door
of
the
dining-room
,
*NL*
paused
,
and
found
that
the
songs
,
toasts
,
and
conversation
were
*NL*
proceeding
quite
satisfactorily
without
his
presence
.
The
Corporation
,
*NL*
private
residents
,
and
major
and
minor
tradesmen
had
,
in
fact
,
gone
*NL*
in
for
comforting
beverages
to
such
an
extent
that
they
had
quite
*NL*
forgotten
,
not
only
the
Mayor
,
but
all
those
vast
,
political
,
religious
,
*NL*
and
social
differences
which
they
felt
necessary
to
maintain
in
the
*NL*
daytime
,
and
which
separated
them
like
iron
grills
.
Seeing
this
the
*NL*
Mayor
took
his
hat
,
and
when
the
waiter
had
helped
him
on
with
a
thin
*NL*
holland
overcoat
,
went
out
and
stood
under
the
portico
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
few
persons
were
now
in
the
street
;
and
his
eyes
,
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
attraction
,
turned
and
dwelt
upon
a
spot
about
a
hundred
yards
further
*NL*
down
.
It
was
the
house
to
which
the
writer
of
the
note
had
gone
--
the
*NL*
Three
Mariners
--
whose
two
prominent
Elizabethan
gables
,
bow-window
,
and
*NL*
passage-light
could
be
seen
from
where
he
stood
.
Having
kept
his
eyes
on
*NL*
it
for
a
while
he
strolled
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
ancient
house
of
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
,
now
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
pulled
down
,
was
built
of
mellow
sandstone
,
with
*NL*
mullioned
windows
of
the
same
material
,
markedly
out
of
perpendicular
*NL*
from
the
settlement
of
foundations
.
The
bay
window
projecting
into
the
*NL*
street
,
whose
interior
was
so
popular
among
the
frequenters
of
the
*NL*
inn
,
was
closed
with
shutters
,
in
each
of
which
appeared
a
heart-shaped
*NL*
aperture
,
somewhat
more
attenuated
in
the
right
and
left
ventricles
*NL*
than
is
seen
in
Nature
.
Inside
these
illuminated
holes
,
at
a
distance
of
*NL*
about
three
inches
,
were
ranged
at
this
hour
,
as
every
passer
knew
,
the
*NL*
ruddy
polls
of
Billy
Wills
the
glazier
,
Smart
the
shoemaker
,
Buzzford
*NL*
the
general
dealer
,
and
others
of
a
secondary
set
of
worthies
,
of
a
*NL*
grade
somewhat
below
that
of
the
diners
at
the
King
's
Arms
,
each
with
*NL*
his
yard
of
clay
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
four-centred
Tudor
arch
was
over
the
entrance
,
and
over
the
arch
*NL*
the
signboard
,
now
visible
in
the
rays
of
an
opposite
lamp
.
Hereon
*NL*
the
Mariners
,
who
had
been
represented
by
the
artist
as
persons
of
two
*NL*
dimensions
only
--
in
other
words
,
flat
as
a
shadow
--
were
standing
in
a
*NL*
row
in
paralyzed
attitudes
.
Being
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
the
*NL*
three
comrades
had
suffered
largely
from
warping
,
splitting
,
fading
,
and
*NL*
shrinkage
,
so
that
they
were
but
a
half-invisible
film
upon
the
reality
*NL*
of
the
grain
,
and
knots
,
and
nails
,
which
composed
the
signboard
.
As
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
this
state
of
things
was
not
so
much
owing
to
Stannidge
*NL*
the
landlord
's
neglect
,
as
from
the
lack
of
a
painter
in
Casterbridge
*NL*
who
would
undertake
to
reproduce
the
features
of
men
so
traditional
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
,
narrow
,
dimly-lit
passage
gave
access
to
the
inn
,
within
which
*NL*
passage
the
horses
going
to
their
stalls
at
the
back
,
and
the
coming
and
*NL*
departing
human
guests
,
rubbed
shoulders
indiscriminately
,
the
latter
*NL*
running
no
slight
risk
of
having
their
toes
trodden
upon
by
the
animals
.
*NL*
The
good
stabling
and
the
good
ale
of
the
Mariners
,
though
somewhat
*NL*
difficult
to
reach
on
account
of
there
being
but
this
narrow
way
to
*NL*
both
,
were
nevertheless
perseveringly
sought
out
by
the
sagacious
old
*NL*
heads
who
knew
what
was
what
in
Casterbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
stood
without
the
inn
for
a
few
instants
;
then
lowering
the
*NL*
dignity
of
his
presence
as
much
as
possible
by
buttoning
the
brown
*NL*
holland
coat
over
his
shirt-front
,
and
in
other
ways
toning
himself
down
*NL*
to
his
ordinary
everyday
appearance
,
he
entered
the
inn
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
7
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
and
her
mother
had
arrived
some
twenty
minutes
earlier
.
*NL*
Outside
the
house
they
had
stood
and
considered
whether
even
this
homely
*NL*
place
,
though
recommended
as
moderate
,
might
not
be
too
serious
in
its
*NL*
prices
for
their
light
pockets
.
Finally
,
however
,
they
had
found
courage
*NL*
to
enter
,
and
duly
met
Stannidge
the
landlord
,
a
silent
man
,
who
drew
*NL*
and
carried
frothing
measures
to
this
room
and
to
that
,
shoulder
to
*NL*
shoulder
with
his
waiting-maids
--
a
stately
slowness
,
however
,
entering
*NL*
into
his
ministrations
by
contrast
with
theirs
,
as
became
one
whose
*NL*
service
was
somewhat
optional
.
It
would
have
been
altogether
optional
*NL*
but
for
the
orders
of
the
landlady
,
a
person
who
sat
in
the
bar
,
*NL*
corporeally
motionless
,
but
with
a
flitting
eye
and
quick
ear
,
with
*NL*
which
she
observed
and
heard
through
the
open
door
and
hatchway
the
*NL*
pressing
needs
of
customers
whom
her
husband
overlooked
though
close
at
*NL*
hand
.
Elizabeth
and
her
mother
were
passively
accepted
as
sojourners
,
*NL*
and
shown
to
a
small
bedroom
under
one
of
the
gables
,
where
they
sat
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
principle
of
the
inn
seemed
to
be
to
compensate
for
the
antique
*NL*
awkwardness
,
crookedness
,
and
obscurity
of
the
passages
,
floors
,
and
*NL*
windows
,
by
quantities
of
clean
linen
spread
about
everywhere
,
and
this
*NL*
had
a
dazzling
effect
upon
the
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
too
good
for
us
--
we
ca
n't
meet
it
!
''
said
the
elder
woman
,
looking
*NL*
round
the
apartment
with
misgiving
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
it
is
,
too
,
''
said
Elizabeth
.
``
But
we
must
be
respectable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
pay
our
way
even
before
we
must
be
respectable
,
''
replied
her
*NL*
mother
.
``
Mr.
Henchard
is
too
high
for
us
to
make
ourselves
known
to
him
,
*NL*
I
much
fear
;
so
we
've
only
our
own
pockets
to
depend
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
I
'll
do
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
after
an
interval
of
waiting
,
*NL*
during
which
their
needs
seemed
quite
forgotten
under
the
press
of
*NL*
business
below
.
And
leaving
the
room
,
she
descended
the
stairs
and
*NL*
penetrated
to
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
was
one
good
thing
more
than
another
which
characterized
this
*NL*
single-hearted
girl
it
was
a
willingness
to
sacrifice
her
personal
*NL*
comfort
and
dignity
to
the
common
weal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
seem
busy
here
to-night
,
and
mother
's
not
well
off
,
might
I
take
*NL*
out
part
of
our
accommodation
by
helping
?
''
she
asked
of
the
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
,
who
remained
as
fixed
in
the
arm-chair
as
if
she
had
been
*NL*
melted
into
it
when
in
a
liquid
state
,
and
could
not
now
be
unstuck
,
*NL*
looked
the
girl
up
and
down
inquiringly
,
with
her
hands
on
the
*NL*
chair-arms
.
Such
arrangements
as
the
one
Elizabeth
proposed
were
*NL*
not
uncommon
in
country
villages
;
but
,
though
Casterbridge
was
*NL*
old-fashioned
,
the
custom
was
well-nigh
obsolete
here
.
The
mistress
*NL*
of
the
house
,
however
,
was
an
easy
woman
to
strangers
,
and
she
made
no
*NL*
objection
.
Thereupon
Elizabeth
,
being
instructed
by
nods
and
motions
*NL*
from
the
taciturn
landlord
as
to
where
she
could
find
the
different
*NL*
things
,
trotted
up
and
down
stairs
with
materials
for
her
own
and
her
*NL*
parent
's
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
doing
this
the
wood
partition
in
the
centre
of
the
house
*NL*
thrilled
to
its
centre
with
the
tugging
of
a
bell-pull
upstairs
.
A
bell
*NL*
below
tinkled
a
note
that
was
feebler
in
sound
than
the
twanging
of
*NL*
wires
and
cranks
that
had
produced
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
Scotch
gentleman
,
''
said
the
landlady
omnisciently
;
and
turning
*NL*
her
eyes
to
Elizabeth
,
``
Now
then
,
can
you
go
and
see
if
his
supper
is
on
*NL*
the
tray
?
If
it
is
you
can
take
it
up
to
him
.
The
front
room
over
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
though
hungry
,
willingly
postponed
serving
herself
*NL*
awhile
,
and
applied
to
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
whence
she
brought
*NL*
forth
the
tray
of
supper
viands
,
and
proceeded
with
it
upstairs
to
the
*NL*
apartment
indicated
.
The
accommodation
of
the
Three
Mariners
was
far
*NL*
from
spacious
,
despite
the
fair
area
of
ground
it
covered
.
The
*NL*
room
demanded
by
intrusive
beams
and
rafters
,
partitions
,
passages
,
*NL*
staircases
,
disused
ovens
,
settles
,
and
four-posters
,
left
comparatively
*NL*
small
quarters
for
human
beings
.
Moreover
,
this
being
at
a
time
before
*NL*
home-brewing
was
abandoned
by
the
smaller
victuallers
,
and
a
house
in
*NL*
which
the
twelve-bushel
strength
was
still
religiously
adhered
to
by
the
*NL*
landlord
in
his
ale
,
the
quality
of
the
liquor
was
the
chief
attraction
*NL*
of
the
premises
,
so
that
everything
had
to
make
way
for
utensils
and
*NL*
operations
in
connection
therewith
.
Thus
Elizabeth
found
that
the
*NL*
Scotchman
was
located
in
a
room
quite
close
to
the
small
one
that
had
*NL*
been
allotted
to
herself
and
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
entered
nobody
was
present
but
the
young
man
himself
--
the
*NL*
same
whom
she
had
seen
lingering
without
the
windows
of
the
King
's
Arms
*NL*
Hotel
.
He
was
now
idly
reading
a
copy
of
the
local
paper
,
and
was
hardly
*NL*
conscious
of
her
entry
,
so
that
she
looked
at
him
quite
coolly
,
and
saw
*NL*
how
his
forehead
shone
where
the
light
caught
it
,
and
how
nicely
his
*NL*
hair
was
cut
,
and
the
sort
of
velvet-pile
or
down
that
was
on
the
skin
*NL*
at
the
back
of
his
neck
,
and
how
his
cheek
was
so
truly
curved
as
to
be
*NL*
part
of
a
globe
,
and
how
clearly
drawn
were
the
lids
and
lashes
which
*NL*
hid
his
bent
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
down
the
tray
,
spread
his
supper
,
and
went
away
without
a
word
.
*NL*
On
her
arrival
below
the
landlady
,
who
was
as
kind
as
she
was
fat
*NL*
and
lazy
,
saw
that
Elizabeth-Jane
was
rather
tired
,
though
in
her
*NL*
earnestness
to
be
useful
she
was
waiving
her
own
needs
altogether
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Stannidge
thereupon
said
with
a
considerate
peremptoriness
that
she
and
*NL*
her
mother
had
better
take
their
own
suppers
if
they
meant
to
have
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
fetched
their
simple
provisions
,
as
she
had
fetched
the
*NL*
Scotchman
's
,
and
went
up
to
the
little
chamber
where
she
had
left
her
*NL*
mother
,
noiselessly
pushing
open
the
door
with
the
edge
of
the
tray
.
To
*NL*
her
surprise
her
mother
,
instead
of
being
reclined
on
the
bed
where
she
*NL*
had
left
her
was
in
an
erect
position
,
with
lips
parted
.
At
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
entry
she
lifted
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meaning
of
this
was
soon
apparent
.
The
room
allotted
to
the
two
*NL*
women
had
at
one
time
served
as
a
dressing-room
to
the
Scotchman
's
*NL*
chamber
,
as
was
evidenced
by
signs
of
a
door
of
communication
between
*NL*
them
--
now
screwed
up
and
pasted
over
with
the
wall
paper
.
But
,
as
is
*NL*
frequently
the
case
with
hotels
of
far
higher
pretensions
than
the
Three
*NL*
Mariners
,
every
word
spoken
in
either
of
these
rooms
was
distinctly
*NL*
audible
in
the
other
.
Such
sounds
came
through
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
silently
conjured
Elizabeth
deposited
the
tray
,
and
her
mother
*NL*
whispered
as
she
drew
near
,
''
'T
is
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mayor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tremors
in
Susan
Henchard
's
tone
might
have
led
any
person
but
one
*NL*
so
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
the
truth
as
the
girl
was
,
to
surmise
*NL*
some
closer
connection
than
the
admitted
simple
kinship
as
a
means
of
*NL*
accounting
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
men
were
indeed
talking
in
the
adjoining
chamber
,
the
young
*NL*
Scotchman
and
Henchard
,
who
,
having
entered
the
inn
while
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
was
in
the
kitchen
waiting
for
the
supper
,
had
been
deferentially
*NL*
conducted
upstairs
by
host
Stannidge
himself
.
The
girl
noiselessly
laid
*NL*
out
their
little
meal
,
and
beckoned
to
her
mother
to
join
her
,
which
*NL*
Mrs.
Henchard
mechanically
did
,
her
attention
being
fixed
on
the
*NL*
conversation
through
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
strolled
in
on
my
way
home
to
ask
you
a
question
about
*NL*
something
that
has
excited
my
curiosity
,
''
said
the
Mayor
,
with
careless
*NL*
geniality
.
``
But
I
see
you
have
not
finished
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
I
will
be
done
in
a
little
!
Ye
need
n't
go
,
sir
.
Take
a
seat
.
*NL*
I
've
almost
done
,
and
it
makes
no
difference
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
seemed
to
take
the
seat
offered
,
and
in
a
moment
he
resumed
:
*NL*
``
Well
,
first
I
should
ask
,
did
you
write
this
?
''
A
rustling
of
paper
*NL*
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
,
''
said
the
Scotchman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
I
am
under
the
impression
that
we
have
met
by
*NL*
accident
while
waiting
for
the
morning
to
keep
an
appointment
with
each
*NL*
other
?
My
name
is
Henchard
,
ha
'n'
t
you
replied
to
an
advertisement
for
a
*NL*
corn-factor
's
manager
that
I
put
into
the
paper
--
ha
'n'
t
you
come
here
to
*NL*
see
me
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
Scotchman
,
with
some
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
are
the
man
,
''
went
on
Henchard
insistingly
,
``
who
arranged
to
*NL*
come

was
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
wrong

''
said
the
young
man
.
``
My
name
is
Donald
Farfrae
.
It
is
*NL*
true
I
am
in
the
corren
trade

but
I
have
replied
to
no
advertisement

*NL*

arranged

I
am
on

way
to
Bristol

from
there
to
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
warrld
,
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
great
wheat-growing

districts
of

West

I
have
some

useful
to
the

*NL*
there
is
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
America
--
well
,
well
,
''
said
Henchard
,
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
,
so
*NL*
strong
as
to
make
itself
felt
like
a
damp
atmosphere
.
``
And
yet
I
could
*NL*
have
sworn
you
were
the
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Scotchman
murmured
another
negative
,
and
there
was
a
silence
,
till
*NL*
Henchard
resumed
:
``
Then
I
am
truly
and
sincerely
obliged
to
you
for
the
*NL*
few
words
you
wrote
on
that
paper

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
nothing
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
has
a
great
importance
for
me
just
now
.
This
row
about
my
*NL*
grown
wheat
,
which
I
declare
to
Heaven
I
did
n't
know
to
be
bad
till
the
*NL*
people
came
complaining
,
has
put
me
to
my
wits

end
.
I
've
some
hundreds
*NL*
of
quarters
of
it
on
hand
;
and
if
your
renovating
process
will
make
it
*NL*
wholesome
,
why
,
you
can
see
what
a
quag
`
twould
get
me
out
of
.
I
saw
*NL*
in
a
moment
there
might
be
truth
in
it
.
But
I
should
like
to
have
it
*NL*
proved
;
and
of
course
you
do
n't
care
to
tell
the
steps
of
the
process
*NL*
sufficiently
for
me
to
do
that
,
without
my
paying
ye
well
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
reflected
a
moment
or
two
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
any
*NL*
objection
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
going
to
another
country
,
and
curing
bad
*NL*
corn

not
the

I
'll
take

there

Yes
,
I
'll
tell
ye
the
whole
of
*NL*
it
--
you
'll
make
more
out

I

*NL*
Just
look
heere
a
minute

I
can
show

carpet-bag

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
click
of
a
lock
followed
,
and
there
was
a
sifting
and
rustling
;
*NL*
then
a
discussion
about
so
many
ounces
to
the
bushel
,
and
drying
,
and
*NL*
refrigerating
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
few
grains
will
be
sufficient
to
show
ye
with

''
came
in
the
young
*NL*
fellow
's
voice
;
and
after
a
pause
,
during
which
some
operation
seemed
*NL*
to
be
intently
watched
by
them
both
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
There
,
now
,
do
you
*NL*
taste
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
complete

quite
restored

nearly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
enough
restored
to
make
good
seconds
out
of
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Scotchman
.
``
To
fetch
it
back
entirely
is
impossible
;
Nature
wo
n't
stand
*NL*
so
much
as
that
,
but
heere
you
go
a
great
way
towards
it
.
Well
,
sir
,
*NL*
that
's
the
process
,
I
do
n't
value
it
,
for
it
can
be
but
of
little
use
*NL*
in
countries
where
the
weather
is
more
settled
than
in
ours
;
and
I
'll
be
*NL*
only
too
glad
if
it
's
of
service
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
hearken
to
me
,
''
pleaded
Henchard
.
``
My
business
you
know
,
is
in
corn
*NL*

in
hay
,
but
I
was
brought
up
as

simply
,
and
hay
is
*NL*
what
I
understand
best

I
now
do
more
in
corn

in
the
other

*NL*
If
you
'll
accept
the

you
shall
manage

entirely

receive
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
liberal

very
liberal

no

''
the
young
man
*NL*
still
replied
,
with
some
distress
in
his
accents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
!
''
said
Henchard
conclusively
.
``
Now
--
to
change
the
subject

one
*NL*
good
turn
deserves
another

do
n't

miserable
supper

*NL*
Come

I
can
find
something
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
Donald
Farfrae
was
grateful
--
said
he
feared
he
must
decline
--
that
he
*NL*
wished
to
leave
early
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

''
said
Henchard
quickly
,
``
please
yourself

But
I
tell
you

*NL*
young

,
if
this
holds
good
for

it
has
done
for
the
*NL*
sample

you
have
saved
my
credit

stranger

What
shall
I

pay
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

nothing
at

not
prove
necessary

I
do
n't
value
it
at

I
thought
I
might
just
as
well

let
ye
know
,
as
you
were
in
a
difficulty

they
were

*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
paused
.
``
I
sha
n't
soon
forget
this
,

he
said
.
``
And
from
a

*NL*
I
to
myself
,
`
He
knows
who
I
am

and
recommends
himself
by
this
stroke

'
*NL*
And
yet
it
turns
out
,
after
all
,
that
you
are
not
the
man
who
answered
*NL*
my
advertisement
,
but
a
stranger
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
;
that
's
so
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
again
suspended
his
words
,
and
then
his
voice
came
*NL*
thoughtfully
:
``
Your
forehead
,
Farfrae
,
is
something
like
my
poor
*NL*
brother
's
--
now
dead
and
gone
;
and
the
nose
,
too
,
is
n't
unlike
his
.
You
*NL*
must
be
,
what
--
five
foot
nine
,
I
reckon
?
I
am
six
foot
one
and
a
half
*NL*
out
of
my
shoes
.
But
what
of
that
?
In
my
business
,
't
is
true
that
*NL*
strength
and
bustle
build
up
a
firm
.
But
judgment
and
knowledge
are
what
*NL*
keep
it
established
.
Unluckily
,
I
am
bad
at
science
,
Farfrae
;
bad
at
*NL*
figures
--
a
rule
o
'
thumb
sort
of
man
.
You
are
just
the
reverse
--
I
can
*NL*
see
that
.
I
have
been
looking
for
such
as
you
these
two
year
,
and
yet
*NL*
you
are
not
for
me
.
Well
,
before
I
go
,
let
me
ask
this
:
Though
you
are
*NL*
not
the
young
man
I
thought
you
were
,
what
's
the
difference
?
Ca
n't
*NL*
ye
stay
just
the
same
?
Have
you
really
made
up
your
mind
about
this
*NL*
American
notion
?
I
wo
n't
mince
matters
.
I
feel
you
would
be
invaluable
*NL*
to
me
--
that
need
n't
be
said
--
and
if
you
will
bide
and
be
my
manager
,
I
*NL*
will
make
it
worth
your
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
plans
are
fixed
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
in
negative
tones
.
``
I
have
*NL*
formed
a
scheme
,
and
so
we
need
na
say
any
more
about
it
.
But
will
you
*NL*
not
drink
with
me
,
sir
?
I
find
this
Casterbridge
ale
warreming
to
the
*NL*
stomach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
fain
would
,
but
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Henchard
gravely
,
the
scraping
*NL*
of
his
chair
informing
the
listeners
that
he
was
rising
to
leave
.
``
When
*NL*
I
was
a
young
man
I
went
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
too
strong
--
far
too
*NL*
strong
--
and
was
well-nigh
ruined
by
it
!
I
did
a
deed
on
account
of
it
*NL*
which
I
shall
be
ashamed
of
to
my
dying
day
.
It
made
such
an
impression
*NL*
on
me
that
I
swore
,
there
and
then
,
that
I
'd
drink
nothing
stronger
than
*NL*
tea
for
as
many
years
as
I
was
old
that
day
.
I
have
kept
my
oath
;
and
*NL*
though
,
Farfrae
,
I
am
sometimes
that
dry
in
the
dog
days
that
I
could
*NL*
drink
a
quarter-barrel
to
the
pitching
,
I
think
o
'
my
oath
,
and
touch
no
*NL*
strong
drink
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
no
'
press
ye
,
sir
--
I
'll
no
'
press
ye
.
I
respect
your
vow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
shall
get
a
manager
somewhere
,
no
doubt
,
''
said
Henchard
,
with
*NL*
strong
feeling
in
his
tones
.
``
But
it
will
be
long
before
I
see
one
that
*NL*
would
suit
me
so
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
appeared
much
moved
by
Henchard
's
warm
convictions
of
*NL*
his
value
.
He
was
silent
till
they
reached
the
door
.
``
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
stay
--
sincerely
I
would
like
to
,
''
he
replied
.
``
But
no
--
it
cannet
be
!
it
*NL*
cannet
!
I
want
to
see
the
warrld
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
8
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
parted
;
and
Elizabeth-Jane
and
her
mother
remained
each
in
her
*NL*
thoughts
over
their
meal
,
the
mother
's
face
being
strangely
bright
*NL*
since
Henchard
's
avowal
of
shame
for
a
past
action
.
The
quivering
of
the
*NL*
partition
to
its
core
presently
denoted
that
Donald
Farfrae
had
again
*NL*
rung
his
bell
,
no
doubt
to
have
his
supper
removed
;
for
humming
a
tune
,
*NL*
and
walking
up
and
down
,
he
seemed
to
be
attracted
by
the
lively
bursts
*NL*
of
conversation
and
melody
from
the
general
company
below
.
He
sauntered
*NL*
out
upon
the
landing
,
and
descended
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Elizabeth-Jane
had
carried
down
his
supper
tray
,
and
also
that
used
*NL*
by
her
mother
and
herself
,
she
found
the
bustle
of
serving
to
be
at
its
*NL*
height
below
,
as
it
always
was
at
this
hour
.
The
young
woman
shrank
from
*NL*
having
anything
to
do
with
the
ground-floor
serving
,
and
crept
silently
*NL*
about
observing
the
scene
--
so
new
to
her
,
fresh
from
the
seclusion
of
*NL*
a
seaside
cottage
.
In
the
general
sitting-room
,
which
was
large
,
she
*NL*
remarked
the
two
or
three
dozen
strong-backed
chairs
that
stood
round
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
each
fitted
with
its
genial
occupant
;
the
sanded
*NL*
floor
;
the
black
settle
which
,
projecting
endwise
from
the
wall
within
*NL*
the
door
,
permitted
Elizabeth
to
be
a
spectator
of
all
that
went
on
*NL*
without
herself
being
particularly
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Scotchman
had
just
joined
the
guests
.
These
,
in
addition
to
*NL*
the
respectable
master-tradesmen
occupying
the
seats
of
privileges
in
*NL*
the
bow-window
and
its
neighbourhood
,
included
an
inferior
set
at
the
*NL*
unlighted
end
,
whose
seats
were
mere
benches
against
the
wall
,
and
who
*NL*
drank
from
cups
instead
of
from
glasses
.
Among
the
latter
she
noticed
*NL*
some
of
those
personages
who
had
stood
outside
the
windows
of
the
King
's
*NL*
Arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
their
backs
was
a
small
window
,
with
a
wheel
ventilator
in
one
*NL*
of
the
panes
,
which
would
suddenly
start
off
spinning
with
a
jingling
*NL*
sound
,
as
suddenly
stop
,
and
as
suddenly
start
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
thus
furtively
making
her
survey
the
opening
words
of
a
song
*NL*
greeted
her
ears
from
the
front
of
the
settle
,
in
a
melody
and
accent
*NL*
of
peculiar
charm
.
There
had
been
some
singing
before
she
came
down
;
and
*NL*
now
the
Scotchman
had
made
himself
so
soon
at
home
that
,
at
the
request
*NL*
of
some
of
the
master-tradesmen
,
he
,
too
,
was
favouring
the
room
with
a
*NL*
ditty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
was
fond
of
music
;
she
could
not
help
pausing
to
listen
;
*NL*
and
the
longer
she
listened
the
more
she
was
enraptured
.
She
had
never
*NL*
heard
any
singing
like
this
and
it
was
evident
that
the
majority
of
the
*NL*
audience
had
not
heard
such
frequently
,
for
they
were
attentive
to
a
*NL*
much
greater
degree
than
usual
.
They
neither
whispered
,
nor
drank
,
nor
*NL*
dipped
their
pipe-stems
in
their
ale
to
moisten
them
,
nor
pushed
the
mug
*NL*
to
their
neighbours
.
The
singer
himself
grew
emotional
,
till
she
could
*NL*
imagine
a
tear
in
his
eye
as
the
words
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hame
,
and
it
's
hame
,
hame
fain
would
I
be
,
*NL*
O
hame
,
hame
,
hame
to
my
ain
countree
!
*NL*
There
's
an
eye
that
ever
weeps
,
and
a
fair
face
will
be
fain
,
*NL*
As
I
pass
through
Annan
Water
with
my
bonnie
bands
again
;
*NL*
When
the
flower
is
in
the
bud
,
and
the
leaf
upon
the
tree
,
*NL*
The
lark
shall
sing
me
hame
to
my
ain
countree
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
burst
of
applause
,
and
a
deep
silence
which
was
even
more
*NL*
eloquent
than
the
applause
.
It
was
of
such
a
kind
that
the
snapping
of
a
*NL*
pipe-stem
too
long
for
him
by
old
Solomon
Longways
,
who
was
one
of
those
*NL*
gathered
at
the
shady
end
of
the
room
,
seemed
a
harsh
and
irreverent
*NL*
act
.
Then
the
ventilator
in
the
window-pane
spasmodically
started
off
*NL*
for
a
new
spin
,
and
the
pathos
of
Donald
's
song
was
temporarily
effaced
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
not
amiss
--
not
at
all
amiss
!
''
muttered
Christopher
Coney
,
who
was
*NL*
also
present
.
And
removing
his
pipe
a
finger
's
breadth
from
his
lips
,
he
*NL*
said
aloud
,
``
Draw
on
with
the
next
verse
,
young
gentleman
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Let
's
have
it
again
,
stranger
,
''
said
the
glazier
,
a
stout
,
*NL*
bucket-headed
man
,
with
a
white
apron
rolled
up
round
his
waist
.
``
Folks
*NL*
do
n't
lift
up
their
hearts
like
that
in
this
part
of
the
world
.
''
And
*NL*
turning
aside
,
he
said
in
undertones
,
``
Who
is
the
young
man
?
--
Scotch
,
*NL*
d'ye
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
straight
from
the
mountains
of
Scotland
,
I
believe
,
''
replied
*NL*
Coney
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Farfrae
repeated
the
last
verse
.
It
was
plain
that
nothing
so
*NL*
pathetic
had
been
heard
at
the
Three
Mariners
for
a
considerable
time
.
*NL*
The
difference
of
accent
,
the
excitability
of
the
singer
,
the
intense
*NL*
local
feeling
,
and
the
seriousness
with
which
he
worked
himself
up
to
a
*NL*
climax
,
surprised
this
set
of
worthies
,
who
were
only
too
prone
to
shut
*NL*
up
their
emotions
with
caustic
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Danged
if
our
country
down
here
is
worth
singing
about
like
that
!
''
*NL*
continued
the
glazier
,
as
the
Scotchman
again
melodized
with
a
dying
*NL*
fall
,
``
My
ain
countree
!
''
``
When
you
take
away
from
among
us
the
fools
*NL*
and
the
rogues
,

the
lammigers

wanton
hussies
,
and
the
*NL*
slatterns
,
and
such
like
,
there
's
cust
few
left
to
ornament
a
song
with
*NL*
in
Casterbridge
,
or
the
country
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Buzzford
,
the
dealer
,
looking
at
the
grain
of
the
table
.
*NL*
``
Casterbridge
is
a
old
,
hoary
place
o
'
wickedness

by
all

'T
is

history
that
we
rebelled
against
the
King
one
or
two
hundred
*NL*
years
ago
,
in
the
time
of
the
Romans
,
and
that
lots
of
us
was
hanged
*NL*
on
Gallows
Hill
,
and
quartered
,
and
our
different
jints
sent
about
the
*NL*
country

butcher
's
meat

for
my
part
I
can
well
believe
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
ye
come
away
from
yer

country

''
inquired
Christopher
Coney
,
from
the
background
,
*NL*
with
the
tone
of
a
man
who
preferred
the
original
subject
.
``
Faith
,
it
*NL*
was
n't
worth
your

Billy

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
no
!
''
said
Donald
Farfrae
,
gazing
round
into
their
faces
with
*NL*
earnest
concern
;
``
the
best
of
ye
hardly
honest

not
that
surely

None

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord

no

no

said
Solomon
Longways
,
smiling
grimly
.
``
That
's
only
his
*NL*
random
way
o

speaking

A
was
always
such
a

''
-LRB-
And
*NL*
reprovingly
towards
Christopher
-RRB-
:
``
Do
n't
ye
be
so
over-familiar
with
a
*NL*
gentleman
that
ye
know
nothing
of

and
that

travelled
a
`
most
from
the
*NL*
North
Pole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Christopher
Coney
was
silenced
,
and
as
he
could
get
no
public
sympathy
,
*NL*
he
mumbled
his
feelings
to
himself
:
``
Be
dazed
,
if
I
loved
my
country
*NL*
half
as
well
as
the
young
feller
do
,
I
'd
live
by
claning
my
neighbour
's
*NL*
pigsties
afore
I
'd
go
away
!
For
my
part
I
've
no
more
love
for
my
country
*NL*
than
I
have
for
Botany
Bay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Longways
;
``
let
the
young
man
draw
onward
with
his
ballet
,
*NL*
or
we
shall
be
here
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
of
it
,
''
said
the
singer
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soul
of
my
body
,
then
we
'll
have
another
!
''
said
the
general
dealer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
turn
a
strain
to
the
ladies
,
sir
?
''
inquired
a
fat
woman
with
*NL*
a
figured
purple
apron
,
the
waiststring
of
which
was
overhung
so
far
by
*NL*
her
sides
as
to
be
invisible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
breathe
--
let
him
breathe
,
Mother
Cuxsom
.
He
hai
n't
got
his
*NL*
second
wind
yet
,
''
said
the
master
glazier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
but
I
have
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
;
and
he
at
once
rendered
*NL*
``
O
Nannie
''
with
faultless
modulations
,
and
another
or
two
of
the
like
*NL*
sentiment
,
winding
up
at
their
earnest
request
with
``
Auld
Lang
Syne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
he
had
completely
taken
possession
of
the
hearts
of
the
*NL*
Three
Mariners
'
inmates
,
including
even
old
Coney
.
Notwithstanding
an
*NL*
occasional
odd
gravity
which
awoke
their
sense
of
the
ludicrous
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
they
began
to
view
him
through
a
golden
haze
which
the
tone
*NL*
of
his
mind
seemed
to
raise
around
him
.
Casterbridge
had
*NL*
sentiment
--
Casterbridge
had
romance
;
but
this
stranger
's
sentiment
was
*NL*
of
differing
quality
.
Or
rather
,
perhaps
,
the
difference
was
mainly
*NL*
superficial
;
he
was
to
them
like
the
poet
of
a
new
school
who
takes
*NL*
his
contemporaries
by
storm
;
who
is
not
really
new
,
but
is
the
first
*NL*
to
articulate
what
all
his
listeners
have
felt
,
though
but
dumbly
till
*NL*
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silent
landlord
came
and
leant
over
the
settle
while
the
young
*NL*
man
sang
;
and
even
Mrs.
Stannidge
managed
to
unstick
herself
from
the
*NL*
framework
of
her
chair
in
the
bar
and
get
as
far
as
the
door-post
,
*NL*
which
movement
she
accomplished
by
rolling
herself
round
,
as
a
cask
*NL*
is
trundled
on
the
chine
by
a
drayman
without
losing
much
of
its
*NL*
perpendicular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
going
to
bide
in
Casterbridge
,
sir
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
no
!
''
said
the
Scotchman
,
with
melancholy
fatality
in
his
voice
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
only
passing
thirrough

I
am
on
my
way
to
Bristol

foreign
parts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
be
truly
sorry
to
hear
it
,

said
Solomon
Longways
.
``
We
can
ill

so
far

we
may

,
where
wolves

wild
boars

other
dangerous
animalcules

blackbirds
here-about

a
thing
we
ca

do
every

and
there
's
good
sound
information

we
when
such
a
man
opens
his
mouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
but
ye
mistake
my
country
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
looking
round
upon
*NL*
them
with
tragic
fixity
,
till
his
eye
lighted
up
and
his
cheek
kindled
*NL*
with
a
sudden
enthusiasm
to
right
their
errors
.
``
There
are
not
perpetual
*NL*
snow
and
wolves
at
all
in
it
!
--
except
snow
in
winter
,
and
--
well
--
a
*NL*
little
in
summer
just
sometimes
,
and
a
`
gaberlunzie
'
or
two
stalking
*NL*
about
here
and
there
,
if
ye
may
call
them
dangerous
.
Eh
,
but
you
should
*NL*
take
a
summer
jarreny
to
Edinboro
'
,
and
Arthur
's
Seat
,
and
all
round
*NL*
there
,
and
then
go
on
to
the
lochs
,
and
all
the
Highland
scenery
--
in
May
*NL*
and
June
--
and
you
would
never
say
't
is
the
land
of
wolves
and
perpetual
*NL*
snow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
--
it
stands
to
reason
,
''
said
Buzzford
.
''
'T
is
barren
*NL*
ignorance
that
leads
to
such
words
.
He
's
a
simple
home-spun
man
,
that
*NL*
never
was
fit
for
good
company
--
think
nothing
of
him
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
ye
carry
your
flock
bed
,
and
your
quilt
,
and
your
crock
,
and
*NL*
your
bit
of
chiney
?
or
do
ye
go
in
bare
bones
,
as
I
may
say
?
''
inquired
*NL*
Christopher
Coney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sent
on
my
luggage
--
though
it
is
n't
much
;
for
the
voyage
is
long
.
''
*NL*
Donald
's
eyes
dropped
into
a
remote
gaze
as
he
added
:
``
But
I
said
to
*NL*
myself
,
`
Never
a
one
of
the
prizes
of
life
will
I
come
by
unless
I
*NL*
undertake
it
!
'
and
I
decided
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
general
sense
of
regret
,
in
which
Elizabeth-Jane
shared
not
least
,
*NL*
made
itself
apparent
in
the
company
.
As
she
looked
at
Farfrae
from
the
*NL*
back
of
the
settle
she
decided
that
his
statements
showed
him
to
be
no
*NL*
less
thoughtful
than
his
fascinating
melodies
revealed
him
to
be
cordial
*NL*
and
impassioned
.
She
admired
the
serious
light
in
which
he
looked
at
*NL*
serious
things
.
He
had
seen
no
jest
in
ambiguities
and
roguery
,
as
the
*NL*
Casterbridge
toss-pots
had
done
;
and
rightly
not
--
there
was
none
.
She
*NL*
disliked
those
wretched
humours
of
Christopher
Coney
and
his
tribe
;
and
*NL*
he
did
not
appreciate
them
.
He
seemed
to
feel
exactly
as
she
felt
about
*NL*
life
and
its
surroundings
--
that
they
were
a
tragical
rather
than
a
*NL*
comical
thing
;
that
though
one
could
be
gay
on
occasion
,
moments
*NL*
of
gaiety
were
interludes
,
and
no
part
of
the
actual
drama
.
It
was
*NL*
extraordinary
how
similar
their
views
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
it
was
still
early
the
young
Scotchman
expressed
his
wish
to
*NL*
retire
,
whereupon
the
landlady
whispered
to
Elizabeth
to
run
upstairs
*NL*
and
turn
down
his
bed
.
She
took
a
candlestick
and
proceeded
on
her
*NL*
mission
,
which
was
the
act
of
a
few
moments
only
.
When
,
candle
in
hand
,
*NL*
she
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
her
way
down
again
,
Mr.
Farfrae
*NL*
was
at
the
foot
coming
up
.
She
could
not
very
well
retreat
;
they
met
and
*NL*
passed
in
the
turn
of
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
have
appeared
interesting
in
some
way
--
not-withstanding
her
*NL*
plain
dress
--
or
rather
,
possibly
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
for
she
was
*NL*
a
girl
characterized
by
earnestness
and
soberness
of
mien
,
with
which
*NL*
simple
drapery
accorded
well
.
Her
face
flushed
,
too
,
at
the
slight
*NL*
awkwardness
of
the
meeting
,
and
she
passed
him
with
her
eyes
bent
on
the
*NL*
candle-flame
that
she
carried
just
below
her
nose
.
Thus
it
happened
*NL*
that
when
confronting
her
he
smiled
;
and
then
,
with
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
temporarily
light-hearted
man
,
who
has
started
himself
on
a
flight
of
*NL*
song
whose
momentum
he
can
not
readily
check
,
he
softly
tuned
an
old
*NL*
ditty
that
she
seemed
to
suggest
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
came
in
by
my
bower
door
,
*NL*
As
day
was
waxin
'
wearie
,
*NL*
Oh
wha
came
tripping
down
the
stair
*NL*
But
bonnie
Peg
my
dearie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
rather
disconcerted
,
hastened
on
;
and
the
Scotchman
's
*NL*
voice
died
away
,
humming
more
of
the
same
within
the
closed
door
of
his
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
scene
and
sentiment
ended
for
the
present
.
When
soon
after
,
*NL*
the
girl
rejoined
her
mother
,
the
latter
was
still
in
thought
--
on
quite
*NL*
another
matter
than
a
young
man
's
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
made
a
mistake
,
''
she
whispered
-LRB-
that
the
Scotch-man
might
not
*NL*
overhear
-RRB-
.
``
On
no
account
ought
ye
to
have
helped
serve
here
to-night
.
*NL*
Not
because
of
ourselves
,
but
for
the
sake
of
him
.
If
he
should
befriend
*NL*
us
,
and
take
us
up
,
and
then
find
out
what
you
did
when
staying
here
,
*NL*
`
twould
grieve
and
wound
his
natural
pride
as
Mayor
of
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
who
would
perhaps
have
been
more
alarmed
at
this
than
her
*NL*
mother
had
she
known
the
real
relationship
,
was
not
much
disturbed
about
*NL*
it
as
things
stood
.
Her
``
he
''
was
another
man
than
her
poor
mother
's
.
*NL*
``
For
myself
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
did
n't
at
all
mind
waiting
a
little
upon
him
.
*NL*
He
's
so
respectable
,
and
educated
--
far
above
the
rest
of
'em
in
the
inn
.
*NL*
They
thought
him
very
simple
not
to
know
their
grim
broad
way
of
talking
*NL*
about
themselves
here
.
But
of
course
he
did
n't
know
--
he
was
too
refined
*NL*
in
his
mind
to
know
such
things
!
''
Thus
she
earnestly
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
``
he
''
of
her
mother
was
not
so
far
away
as
even
they
*NL*
thought
.
After
leaving
the
Three
Mariners
he
had
sauntered
up
and
down
*NL*
the
empty
High
Street
,
passing
and
repassing
the
inn
in
his
promenade
.
*NL*
When
the
Scotchman
sang
his
voice
had
reached
Henchard
's
ears
through
*NL*
the
heart-shaped
holes
in
the
window-shutters
,
and
had
led
him
to
pause
*NL*
outside
them
a
long

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
,
how
that
fellow
does
draw
me
!
''
he
had
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
I
suppose
't
is
because
I
'm
so
lonely
.
I
'd
have
given
him
a
*NL*
third
share
in
the
business
to
have
stayed
!

When
Elizabeth-Jane
opened
the
hinged
casement
next
morning
the
mellow
*NL*
air
brought
in
the
feel
of
imminent
autumn
almost
as
distinctly
as
if
*NL*
she
had
been
in
the
remotest
hamlet
.
Casterbridge
was
the
complement
of
*NL*
the
rural
life
around
,
not
its
urban
opposite
.
Bees
and
butterflies
in
*NL*
the
cornfields
at
the
top
of
the
town
,
who
desired
to
get
to
the
meads
*NL*
at
the
bottom
,
took
no
circuitous
course
,
but
flew
straight
down
High
*NL*
Street
without
any
apparent
consciousness
that
they
were
traversing
*NL*
strange
latitudes
.
And
in
autumn
airy
spheres
of
thistledown
floated
*NL*
into
the
same
street
,
lodged
upon
the
shop
fronts
,
blew
into
drains
,
*NL*
and
innumerable
tawny
and
yellow
leaves
skimmed
along
the
pavement
,
and
*NL*
stole
through
people
's
doorways
into
their
passages
with
a
hesitating
*NL*
scratch
on
the
floor
,
like
the
skirts
of
timid
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
voices
,
one
of
which
was
close
at
hand
,
she
withdrew
her
head
*NL*
and
glanced
from
behind
the
window-curtains
.
Mr.
Henchard
--
now
habited
*NL*
no
longer
as
a
great
personage
,
but
as
a
thriving
man
of
business
--
was
*NL*
pausing
on
his
way
up
the
middle
of
the
street
,
and
the
Scotchman
was
*NL*
looking
from
the
window
adjoining
her
own
.
Henchard
it
appeared
,
had
*NL*
gone
a
little
way
past
the
inn
before
he
had
noticed
his
acquaintance
of
*NL*
the
previous
evening
.
He
came
back
a
few
steps
,
Donald
Farfrae
opening
*NL*
the
window
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
off
soon
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Henchard
upwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
almost
this
moment
,
sir
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
Maybe
I
'll
walk
on
till
*NL*
the
coach
makes
up
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
way
ye
are
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
shall
we
walk
together
to
the
top
o
'
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
ye
'll
wait
a
minute
,
''
said
the
Scotchman
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
the
latter
emerged
,
bag
in
hand
.
Henchard
looked
at
the
*NL*
bag
as
at
an
enemy
.
It
showed
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
young
man
's
*NL*
departure
.
``
Ah
,
my
lad
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
should
have
been
a
wise
man
,
and
*NL*
have
stayed
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
--
it
might
have
been
wiser
,
''
said
Donald
,
looking
*NL*
microscopically
at
the
houses
that
were
furthest
off
.
``
It
is
only
*NL*
telling
ye
the
truth
when
I
say
my
plans
are
vague
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
by
this
time
passed
on
from
the
precincts
of
the
inn
,
*NL*
and
Elizabeth-Jane
heard
no
more
.
She
saw
that
they
continued
*NL*
in
conversation
,
Henchard
turning
to
the
other
occasionally
,
and
*NL*
emphasizing
some
remark
with
a
gesture
.
Thus
they
passed
the
King
's
Arms
*NL*
Hotel
,
the
Market
House
,
St.
Peter
's
churchyard
wall
,
ascending
to
the
*NL*
upper
end
of
the
long
street
till
they
were
small
as
two
grains
of
corn
;
*NL*
when
they
bent
suddenly
to
the
right
into
the
Bristol
Road
,
and
were
out
*NL*
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
good
man
--
and
he
's
gone
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
I
was
nothing
*NL*
to
him
,
and
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
wished
me
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
simple
thought
,
with
its
latent
sense
of
slight
,
had
moulded
itself
*NL*
out
of
the
following
little
fact
:
when
the
Scotchman
came
out
at
the
*NL*
door
he
had
by
accident
glanced
up
at
her
;
and
then
he
had
looked
away
*NL*
again
without
nodding
,
or
smiling
,
or
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
still
thinking
,
mother
,
''
she
said
,
when
she
turned
inwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
am
thinking
of
Mr.
Henchard
's
sudden
liking
for
that
young
man
.
*NL*
He
was
always
so
.
Now
,
surely
,
if
he
takes
so
warmly
to
people
who
are
*NL*
not
related
to
him
at
all
,
may
he
not
take
as
warmly
to
his
own
kin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
debated
this
question
a
procession
of
five
large
waggons
went
*NL*
past
,
laden
with
hay
up
to
the
bedroom
windows
.
They
came
in
from
the
*NL*
country
,
and
the
steaming
horses
had
probably
been
travelling
a
great
*NL*
part
of
the
night
.
To
the
shaft
of
each
hung
a
little
board
,
on
which
*NL*
was
painted
in
white
letters
,
``
Henchard
,
corn-factor
and
hay-merchant
.
''
*NL*
The
spectacle
renewed
his
wife
's
conviction
that
,
for
her
daughter
's
*NL*
sake
,
she
should
strain
a
point
to
rejoin
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
was
continued
during
breakfast
,
and
the
end
of
it
was
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Henchard
decided
,
for
good
or
for
ill
,
to
send
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
with
a
message
to
Henchard
,
to
the
effect
that
his
relative
Susan
,
a
*NL*
sailor
's
widow
,
was
in
the
town
;
leaving
it
to
him
to
say
whether
or
not
*NL*
he
would
recognize
her
.
What
had
brought
her
to
this
determination
were
*NL*
chiefly
two
things
.
He
had
been
described
as
a
lonely
widower
;
and
*NL*
he
had
expressed
shame
for
a
past
transaction
of
his
life
.
There
was
*NL*
promise
in
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
says
no
,
''
she
enjoined
,
as
Elizabeth-Jane
stood
,
bonnet
on
,
ready
*NL*
to
depart
;
``
if
he
thinks
it
does
not
become
the
good
position
he
has
*NL*
reached
to
in
the
town
,
to
own
--
to
let
us
call
on
him
as
--
his
distant
*NL*
kinfolk
,
say
,
`
Then
,
sir
,
we
would
rather
not
intrude
;
we
will
leave
*NL*
Casterbridge
as
quietly
as
we
have
come
,
and
go
back
to
our
own
*NL*
country
.
'
...
I
almost
feel
that
I
would
rather
he
did
say
so
,
as
I
have
*NL*
not
seen
him
for
so
many
years
,
and
we
are
so
--
little
allied
to
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
say
yes
?
''
inquired
the
more
sanguine
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Henchard
cautiously
,
``
ask
him
to
write
me
*NL*
a
note
,
saying
when
and
how
he
will
see
us
--
or
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
went
a
few
steps
towards
the
landing
.
``
And
tell
him
,
''
*NL*
continued
her
mother
,
``
that
I
fully
know
I
have
no
claim
upon
him
--
that
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
find
he
is
thriving
;
that
I
hope
his
life
may
be
long
and
*NL*
happy
--
there
,
go
.
''
Thus
with
a
half-hearted
willingness
,
a
smothered
*NL*
reluctance
,
did
the
poor
forgiving
woman
start
her
unconscious
daughter
*NL*
on
this
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
,
and
market-day
,
when
Elizabeth
paced
up
the
*NL*
High
Street
,
in
no
great
hurry
;
for
to
herself
her
position
was
only
*NL*
that
of
a
poor
relation
deputed
to
hunt
up
a
rich
one
.
The
front
doors
*NL*
of
the
private
houses
were
mostly
left
open
at
this
warm
autumn
time
,
*NL*
no
thought
of
umbrella
stealers
disturbing
the
minds
of
the
placid
*NL*
burgesses
.
Hence
,
through
the
long
,
straight
,
entrance
passages
thus
*NL*
unclosed
could
be
seen
,
as
through
tunnels
,
the
mossy
gardens
at
the
*NL*
back
,
glowing
with
nasturtiums
,
fuchsias
,
scarlet
geraniums
,
``
bloody
*NL*
warriors
,
''
snapdragons
,
and
dahlias
,
this
floral
blaze
being
backed
by
*NL*
crusted
grey
stone-work
remaining
from
a
yet
remoter
Casterbridge
than
*NL*
the
venerable
one
visible
in
the
street
.
The
old-fashioned
fronts
of
*NL*
these
houses
,
which
had
older
than
old-fashioned
backs
,
rose
sheer
*NL*
from
the
pavement
,
into
which
the
bow
windows
protruded
like
bastions
,
*NL*
necessitating
a
pleasing
chassez-dechassez
movement
to
the
time-pressed
*NL*
pedestrian
at
every
few
yards
.
He
was
bound
also
to
evolve
*NL*
other
Terpsichorean
figures
in
respect
of
door-steps
,
scrapers
,
*NL*
cellar-hatches
,
church
buttresses
,
and
the
overhanging
angles
of
walls
*NL*
which
,
originally
unobtrusive
,
had
become
bow-legged
and
knock-kneed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
these
fixed
obstacles
which
spoke
so
cheerfully
of
*NL*
individual
unrestraint
as
to
boundaries
,
movables
occupied
the
path
and
*NL*
roadway
to
a
perplexing
extent
.
First
the
vans
of
the
carriers
in
*NL*
and
out
of
Casterbridge
,
who
hailed
from
Mellstock
,
Weatherbury
,
The
*NL*
Hintocks
,
Sherton-Abbas
,
Kingsbere
,
Overcombe
,
and
many
other
towns
and
*NL*
villages
round
.
Their
owners
were
numerous
enough
to
be
regarded
as
a
*NL*
tribe
,
and
had
almost
distinctiveness
enough
to
be
regarded
as
a
race
.
*NL*
Their
vans
had
just
arrived
,
and
were
drawn
up
on
each
side
of
the
*NL*
street
in
close
file
,
so
as
to
form
at
places
a
wall
between
the
*NL*
pavement
and
the
roadway
.
Moreover
every
shop
pitched
out
half
its
*NL*
contents
upon
trestles
and
boxes
on
the
kerb
,
extending
the
display
*NL*
each
week
a
little
further
and
further
into
the
roadway
,
despite
the
*NL*
expostulations
of
the
two
feeble
old
constables
,
until
there
remained
*NL*
but
a
tortuous
defile
for
carriages
down
the
centre
of
the
street
,
which
*NL*
afforded
fine
opportunities
for
skill
with
the
reins
.
Over
the
pavement
*NL*
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
way
hung
shopblinds
so
constructed
as
to
give
*NL*
the
passenger
's
hat
a
smart
buffet
off
his
head
,
as
from
the
unseen
*NL*
hands
of
Cranstoun
's
Goblin
Page
,
celebrated
in
romantic
lore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Horses
for
sale
were
tied
in
rows
,
their
forelegs
on
the
pavement
,
their
*NL*
hind
legs
in
the
street
,
in
which
position
they
occasionally
nipped
*NL*
little
boys
by
the
shoulder
who
were
passing
to
school
.
And
any
inviting
*NL*
recess
in
front
of
a
house
that
had
been
modestly
kept
back
from
the
*NL*
general
line
was
utilized
by
pig-dealers
as
a
pen
for
their
stock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
yeomen
,
farmers
,
dairymen
,
and
townsfolk
,
who
came
to
transact
*NL*
business
in
these
ancient
streets
,
spoke
in
other
ways
than
by
*NL*
articulation
.
Not
to
hear
the
words
of
your
interlocutor
in
metropolitan
*NL*
centres
is
to
know
nothing
of
his
meaning
.
Here
the
face
,
the
arms
,
the
*NL*
hat
,
the
stick
,
the
body
throughout
spoke
equally
with
the
tongue
.
To
*NL*
express
satisfaction
the
Casterbridge
market-man
added
to
his
utterance
*NL*
a
broadening
of
the
cheeks
,
a
crevicing
of
the
eyes
,
a
throwing
back
of
*NL*
the
shoulders
,
which
was
intelligible
from
the
other
end
of
the
street
.
*NL*
If
he
wondered
,
though
all
Henchard
's
carts
and
waggons
were
rattling
*NL*
past
him
,
you
knew
it
from
perceiving
the
inside
of
his
crimson
mouth
,
*NL*
and
a
target-like
circling
of
his
eyes
.
Deliberation
caused
sundry
*NL*
attacks
on
the
moss
of
adjoining
walls
with
the
end
of
his
stick
,
*NL*
a
change
of
his
hat
from
the
horizontal
to
the
less
so
;
a
sense
of
*NL*
tediousness
announced
itself
in
a
lowering
of
the
person
by
spreading
*NL*
the
knees
to
a
lozenge-shaped
aperture
and
contorting
the
arms
.
*NL*
Chicanery
,
subterfuge
,
had
hardly
a
place
in
the
streets
of
this
honest
*NL*
borough
to
all
appearance
;
and
it
was
said
that
the
lawyers
in
the
Court
*NL*
House
hard
by
occasionally
threw
in
strong
arguments
for
the
other
side
*NL*
out
of
pure
generosity
-LRB-
though
apparently
by
mischance
-RRB-
when
advancing
*NL*
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Casterbridge
was
in
most
respects
but
the
pole
,
focus
,
or
*NL*
nerve-knot
of
the
surrounding
country
life
;
differing
from
the
many
*NL*
manufacturing
towns
which
are
as
foreign
bodies
set
down
,
like
boulders
*NL*
on
a
plain
,
in
a
green
world
with
which
they
have
nothing
in
common
.
*NL*
Casterbridge
lived
by
agriculture
at
one
remove
further
from
the
*NL*
fountainhead
than
the
adjoining
villages
--
no
more
.
The
townsfolk
*NL*
understood
every
fluctuation
in
the
rustic
's
condition
,
for
it
affected
*NL*
their
receipts
as
much
as
the
labourer
's
;
they
entered
into
the
troubles
*NL*
and
joys
which
moved
the
aristocratic
families
ten
miles
round
--
for
the
*NL*
same
reason
.
And
even
at
the
dinner-parties
of
the
professional
families
*NL*
the
subjects
of
discussion
were
corn
,
cattle-disease
,
sowing
and
*NL*
reaping
,
fencing
and
planting
;
while
politics
were
viewed
by
them
less
*NL*
from
their
own
standpoint
of
burgesses
with
rights
and
privileges
than
*NL*
from
the
standpoint
of
their
country
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
venerable
contrivances
and
confusions
which
delighted
the
eye
*NL*
by
their
quaintness
,
and
in
a
measure
reasonableness
,
in
this
rare
old
*NL*
market-town
,
were
metropolitan
novelties
to
the
unpractised
eyes
of
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
fresh
from
netting
fish-seines
in
a
seaside
cottage
.
*NL*
Very
little
inquiry
was
necessary
to
guide
her
footsteps
.
Henchard
's
*NL*
house
was
one
of
the
best
,
faced
with
dull
red-and-grey
old
brick
.
The
*NL*
front
door
was
open
,
and
,
as
in
other
houses
,
she
could
see
through
the
*NL*
passage
to
the
end
of
the
garden
--
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Henchard
was
not
in
the
house
,
but
in
the
store-yard
.
She
was
*NL*
conducted
into
the
mossy
garden
,
and
through
a
door
in
the
wall
,
which
*NL*
was
studded
with
rusty
nails
speaking
of
generations
of
fruit-trees
that
*NL*
had
been
trained
there
.
The
door
opened
upon
the
yard
,
and
here
she
was
*NL*
left
to
find
him
as
she
could
.
It
was
a
place
flanked
by
hay-barns
,
into
*NL*
which
tons
of
fodder
,
all
in
trusses
,
were
being
packed
from
the
waggons
*NL*
she
had
seen
pass
the
inn
that
morning
.
On
other
sides
of
the
yard
were
*NL*
wooden
granaries
on
stone
staddles
,
to
which
access
was
given
by
Flemish
*NL*
ladders
,
and
a
store-house
several
floors
high
.
Wherever
the
doors
of
*NL*
these
places
were
open
,
a
closely
packed
throng
of
bursting
wheat-sacks
*NL*
could
be
seen
standing
inside
,
with
the
air
of
awaiting
a
famine
that
*NL*
would
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wandered
about
this
place
,
uncomfortably
conscious
of
the
impending
*NL*
interview
,
till
she
was
quite
weary
of
searching
;
she
ventured
to
*NL*
inquire
of
a
boy
in
what
quarter
Mr.
Henchard
could
be
found
.
He
*NL*
directed
her
to
an
office
which
she
had
not
seen
before
,
and
knocking
at
*NL*
the
door
she
was
answered
by
a
cry
of
``
Come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
turned
the
handle
;
and
there
stood
before
her
,
bending
over
*NL*
some
sample-bags
on
a
table
,
not
the
corn-merchant
,
but
the
young
*NL*
Scotchman
Mr.
Farfrae
--
in
the
act
of
pouring
some
grains
of
wheat
from
*NL*
one
hand
to
the
other
.
His
hat
hung
on
a
peg
behind
him
,
and
the
roses
*NL*
of
his
carpet-bag
glowed
from
the
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
toned
her
feelings
and
arranged
words
on
her
lips
for
Mr.
*NL*
Henchard
,
and
for
him
alone
,
she
was
for
the
moment
confounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
what
it
is
?
''
said
the
Scotchman
,
like
a
man
who
permanently
ruled
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
she
wanted
to
see
Mr.
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
;
will
you
wait
a
minute
?
He
's
engaged
just
now
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
man
,
apparently
not
recognizing
her
as
the
girl
at
the
inn
.
He
handed
*NL*
her
a
chair
,
bade
her
sit
down
and
turned
to
his
sample-bags
again
.
*NL*
While
Elizabeth-Jane
sits
waiting
in
great
amaze
at
the
young
man
's
*NL*
presence
we
may
briefly
explain
how
he
came
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
two
new
acquaintances
had
passed
out
of
sight
that
morning
*NL*
towards
the
Bath
and
Bristol
road
they
went
on
silently
,
except
for
a
*NL*
few
commonplaces
,
till
they
had
gone
down
an
avenue
on
the
town
walls
*NL*
called
the
Chalk
Walk
,
leading
to
an
angle
where
the
North
and
West
*NL*
escarpments
met
.
From
this
high
corner
of
the
square
earthworks
a
vast
*NL*
extent
of
country
could
be
seen
.
A
footpath
ran
steeply
down
the
green
*NL*
slope
,
conducting
from
the
shady
promenade
on
the
walls
to
a
road
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
scarp
.
It
was
by
this
path
the
Scotchman
had
to
descend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
's
success
to
`
ee
,
''
said
Henchard
,
holding
out
his
right
hand
*NL*
and
leaning
with
his
left
upon
the
wicket
which
protected
the
descent
.
*NL*
In
the
act
there
was
the
inelegance
of
one
whose
feelings
are
nipped
and
*NL*
wishes
defeated
.
``
I
shall
often
think
of
this
time
,
and
of
how
you
came
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
to
throw
a
light
upon
my
difficulty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
holding
the
young
man
's
hand
he
paused
,
and
then
added
*NL*
deliberately
:
``
Now
I
am
not
the
man
to
let
a
cause
be
lost
for
want
of
*NL*
a
word
.
And
before
ye
are
gone
for
ever
I
'll
speak
.
Once
more
,
will
*NL*
ye
stay
?
There
it
is
,
flat
and
plain
.
You
can
see
that
it
is
n't
all
*NL*
selfishness
that
makes
me
press
`
ee
;
for
my
business
is
not
quite
so
*NL*
scientific
as
to
require
an
intellect
entirely
out
of
the
common
.
Others
*NL*
would
do
for
the
place
without
doubt
.
Some
selfishness
perhaps
there
*NL*
is
,
but
there
is
more
;
it
is
n't
for
me
to
repeat
what
.
Come
bide
with
*NL*
me
--
and
name
your
own
terms
.
I
'll
agree
to
'em
willingly
and
`
ithout
a
*NL*
word
of
gainsaying
;
for
,
hang
it
,
Farfrae
,
I
like
thee
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
's
hand
remained
steady
in
Henchard
's
for
a
moment
or
two
.
*NL*
He
looked
over
the
fertile
country
that
stretched
beneath
them
,
then
*NL*
backward
along
the
shaded
walk
reaching
to
the
top
of
the
town
.
His
face
*NL*
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
expected
this
--
I
did
not
!
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
Providence
!
Should
*NL*
any
one
go
against
it
?
No
;
I
'll
not
go
to
America
;
I
'll
stay
and
be
your
*NL*
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
,
which
had
lain
lifeless
in
Henchard
's
,
returned
the
latter
's
*NL*
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
,
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
,
''
said
Donald
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
Mr.
Henchard
beamed
forth
a
satisfaction
that
was
almost
*NL*
fierce
in
its
strength
.
``
Now
you
are
my
friend
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Come
*NL*
back
to
my
house
;
let
's
clinch
it
at
once
by
clear
terms
,
so
as
to
be
*NL*
comfortable
in
our
minds
.
''
Farfrae
caught
up
his
bag
and
retraced
the
*NL*
North-West
Avenue
in
Henchard
's
company
as
he
had
come
.
Henchard
was
all
*NL*
confidence
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
most
distant
fellow
in
the
world
when
I
do
n't
care
for
a
man
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
But
when
a
man
takes
my
fancy
he
takes
it
strong
.
Now
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
can
eat
another
breakfast
?
You
could
n't
have
eaten
much
so
*NL*
early
,
even
if
they
had
anything
at
that
place
to
gi'e
thee
,
which
they
*NL*
had
n't
;
so
come
to
my
house
and
we
will
have
a
solid
,
staunch
tuck-in
,
*NL*
and
settle
terms
in
black-and-white
if
you
like
;
though
my
word
's
my
*NL*
bond
.
I
can
always
make
a
good
meal
in
the
morning
.
I
've
got
a
splendid
*NL*
cold
pigeon-pie
going
just
now
.
You
can
have
some
home-brewed
if
you
*NL*
want
to
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
airly
in
the
morning
for
that
,
''
said
Farfrae
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
,
I
did
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
drink
it
because
of
my
oath
,
*NL*
but
I
am
obliged
to
brew
for
my
work-people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
talking
they
returned
,
and
entered
Henchard
's
premises
by
the
back
*NL*
way
or
traffic
entrance
.
Here
the
matter
was
settled
over
the
breakfast
,
*NL*
at
which
Henchard
heaped
the
young
Scotchman
's
plate
to
a
prodigal
*NL*
fulness
.
He
would
not
rest
satisfied
till
Farfrae
had
written
for
his
*NL*
luggage
from
Bristol
,
and
dispatched
the
letter
to
the
post-office
.
When
*NL*
it
was
done
this
man
of
strong
impulses
declared
that
his
new
friend
*NL*
should
take
up
his
abode
in
his
house
--
at
least
till
some
suitable
*NL*
lodgings
could
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
took
Farfrae
round
and
showed
him
the
place
,
and
the
stores
*NL*
of
grain
,
and
other
stock
;
and
finally
entered
the
offices
where
the
*NL*
younger
of
them
has
already
been
discovered
by
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
10
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
still
sat
under
the
Scotchman
's
eyes
a
man
came
up
to
the
*NL*
door
,
reaching
it
as
Henchard
opened
the
door
of
the
inner
office
to
*NL*
admit
Elizabeth
.
The
newcomer
stepped
forward
like
the
quicker
cripple
*NL*
at
Bethesda
,
and
entered
in
her
stead
.
She
could
hear
his
words
to
*NL*
Henchard
:
``
Joshua
Jopp
,
sir
--
by
appointment
--
the
new
manager
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
new
manager
!
--
he
's
in
his
office
,
''
said
Henchard
bluntly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
his
office
!
''
said
the
man
,
with
a
stultified
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mentioned
Thursday
,
''
said
Henchard
;
``
and
as
you
did
not
keep
your
*NL*
appointment
,
I
have
engaged
another
manager
.
At
first
I
thought
he
must
*NL*
be
you
.
Do
you
think
I
can
wait
when
business
is
in
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
Thursday
or
Saturday
,
sir
,
''
said
the
newcomer
,
pulling
out
a
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
too
late
,
''
said
the
corn-factor
.
``
I
can
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
as
good
as
engaged
me
,
''
murmured
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Subject
to
an
interview
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
I
am
sorry
for
you
--
very
*NL*
sorry
indeed
.
But
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
more
to
be
said
,
and
the
man
came
out
,
encountering
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
in
his
passage
.
She
could
see
that
his
mouth
twitched
*NL*
with
anger
,
and
that
bitter
disappointment
was
written
in
his
face
*NL*
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
now
entered
,
and
stood
before
the
master
of
the
premises
.
*NL*
His
dark
pupils
--
which
always
seemed
to
have
a
red
spark
of
light
in
*NL*
them
,
though
this
could
hardly
be
a
physical
fact
--
turned
indifferently
*NL*
round
under
his
dark
brows
until
they
rested
on
her
figure
.
``
Now
then
,
*NL*
what
is
it
,
my
young
woman
?
''
he
said
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
speak
to
you
--
not
on
business
,
sir
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
suppose
.
''
He
looked
at
her
more
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sent
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
''
she
innocently
went
on
,
``
that
a
distant
*NL*
relative
of
yours
by
marriage
,
Susan
Newson
,
a
sailor
's
widow
,
is
in
the
*NL*
town
,
and
to
ask
whether
you
would
wish
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rich
rouge-et-noir
of
his
countenance
underwent
a
slight
change
.
*NL*
``
Oh
--
Susan
is
--
still
alive
?
''
he
asked
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
her
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
--
her
only
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
do
you
call
yourself
--
your
Christian
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth-Jane
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth-Jane
Newson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
at
once
suggested
to
Henchard
that
the
transaction
of
his
early
*NL*
married
life
at
Weydon
Fair
was
unrecorded
in
the
family
history
.
It
was
*NL*
more
than
he
could
have
expected
.
His
wife
had
behaved
kindly
to
him
*NL*
in
return
for
his
unkindness
,
and
had
never
proclaimed
her
wrong
to
her
*NL*
child
or
to
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
--
a
good
deal
interested
in
your
news
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
as
this
is
*NL*
not
a
matter
of
business
,
but
pleasure
,
suppose
we
go
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
gentle
delicacy
of
manner
,
surprising
to
Elizabeth
,
that
*NL*
he
showed
her
out
of
the
office
and
through
the
outer
room
,
where
Donald
*NL*
Farfrae
was
overhauling
bins
and
samples
with
the
inquiring
inspection
*NL*
of
a
beginner
in
charge
.
Henchard
preceded
her
through
the
door
in
the
*NL*
wall
to
the
suddenly
changed
scene
of
the
garden
and
flowers
,
and
*NL*
onward
into
the
house
.
The
dining-room
to
which
he
introduced
her
still
*NL*
exhibited
the
remnants
of
the
lavish
breakfast
laid
for
Farfrae
.
It
*NL*
was
furnished
to
profusion
with
heavy
mahogany
furniture
of
the
deepest
*NL*
red-Spanish
hues
.
Pembroke
tables
,
with
leaves
hanging
so
low
that
they
*NL*
well-nigh
touched
the
floor
,
stood
against
the
walls
on
legs
and
feet
*NL*
shaped
like
those
of
an
elephant
,
and
on
one
lay
three
huge
folio
*NL*
volumes
--
a
Family
Bible
,
a
``
Josephus
,
''
and
a
``
Whole
Duty
of
Man
.
''
In
the
*NL*
chimney
corner
was
a
fire-grate
with
a
fluted
semicircular
back
,
having
*NL*
urns
and
festoons
cast
in
relief
thereon
,
and
the
chairs
were
of
*NL*
the
kind
which
,
since
that
day
,
has
cast
lustre
upon
the
names
of
*NL*
Chippendale
and
Sheraton
,
though
,
in
point
of
fact
,
their
patterns
may
*NL*
have
been
such
as
those
illustrious
carpenters
never
saw
or
heard
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
--
Elizabeth-Jane
--
sit
down
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
shake
in
his
voice
*NL*
as
he
uttered
her
name
,
and
sitting
down
himself
he
allowed
his
hands
*NL*
to
hang
between
his
knees
while
he
looked
upon
the
carpet
.
``
Your
mother
,
*NL*
then
,
is
quite
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
rather
worn
out
,
sir
,
with
travelling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sailor
's
widow
--
when
did
he
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
was
lost
last
spring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
winced
at
the
word
``
father
,
''
thus
applied
.
``
Do
you
and
she
come
*NL*
from
abroad
--
America
or
Australia
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
We
have
been
in
England
some
years
.
I
was
twelve
when
we
came
here
*NL*
from
Canada
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
;
exactly
.
''
By
such
conversation
he
discovered
the
circumstances
*NL*
which
had
enveloped
his
wife
and
her
child
in
such
total
obscurity
that
*NL*
he
had
long
ago
believed
them
to
be
in
their
graves
.
These
things
being
*NL*
clear
,
he
returned
to
the
present
.
``
And
where
is
your
mother
staying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Three
Mariners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
her
daughter
Elizabeth-Jane
?
''
repeated
Henchard
.
He
arose
,
*NL*
came
close
to
her
,
and
glanced
in
her
face
.
``
I
think
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
*NL*
turning
away
with
a
wet
eye
,
``
you
shall
take
a
note
from
me
to
your
*NL*
mother
.
I
should
like
to
see
her
...
She
is
not
left
very
well
off
by
*NL*
her
late
husband
?
''
His
eye
fell
on
Elizabeth
's
clothes
,
which
,
though
*NL*
a
respectable
suit
of
black
,
and
her
very
best
,
were
decidedly
*NL*
old-fashioned
even
to
Casterbridge
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
well
,
''
she
said
,
glad
that
he
had
divined
this
without
her
*NL*
being
obliged
to
express
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
at
the
table
and
wrote
a
few
lines
,
next
taking
from
his
*NL*
pocket-book
a
five-pound
note
,
which
he
put
in
the
envelope
with
the
*NL*
letter
,
adding
to
it
,
as
by
an
afterthought
,
five
shillings
.
Sealing
the
*NL*
whole
up
carefully
,
he
directed
it
to
``
Mrs.
Newson
,
Three
Mariners
Inn
,
''
*NL*
and
handed
the
packet
to
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deliver
it
to
her
personally
,
please
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
Well
,
I
am
glad
*NL*
to
see
you
here
,
Elizabeth-Jane
--
very
glad
.
We
must
have
a
long
talk
*NL*
together
--
but
not
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
at
parting
,
and
held
it
so
warmly
that
she
,
who
had
*NL*
known
so
little
friendship
,
was
much
affected
,
and
tears
rose
to
her
*NL*
aerial-grey
eyes
.
The
instant
that
she
was
gone
Henchard
's
state
showed
*NL*
itself
more
distinctly
;
having
shut
the
door
he
sat
in
his
dining-room
*NL*
stiffly
erect
,
gazing
at
the
opposite
wall
as
if
he
read
his
history
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begad
!
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
jumping
up
.
``
I
did
n't
think
of
that
.
*NL*
Perhaps
these
are
impostors
--
and
Susan
and
the
child
dead
after
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
a
something
in
Elizabeth-Jane
soon
assured
him
that
,
as
*NL*
regarded
her
,
at
least
,
there
could
be
little
doubt
.
And
a
few
hours
*NL*
would
settle
the
question
of
her
mother
's
identity
;
for
he
had
arranged
*NL*
in
his
note
to
see
her
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
never
rains
but
it
pours
!
''
said
Henchard
.
His
keenly
excited
*NL*
interest
in
his
new
friend
the
Scotchman
was
now
eclipsed
by
this
event
,
*NL*
and
Donald
Farfrae
saw
so
little
of
him
during
the
rest
of
the
day
that
*NL*
he
wondered
at
the
suddenness
of
his
employer
's
moods
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
Elizabeth
had
reached
the
inn
.
Her
mother
,
instead
of
*NL*
taking
the
note
with
the
curiosity
of
a
poor
woman
expecting
assistance
,
*NL*
was
much
moved
at
sight
of
it
.
She
did
not
read
it
at
once
,
asking
*NL*
Elizabeth
to
describe
her
reception
,
and
the
very
words
Mr.
Henchard
*NL*
used
.
Elizabeth
's
back
was
turned
when
her
mother
opened
the
letter
.
It
*NL*
ran
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meet
me
at
eight
o'clock
this
evening
,
if
you
can
,
at
the
Ring
on
the
*NL*
Budmouth
road
.
The
place
is
easy
to
find
.
I
can
say
no
more
now
.
The
*NL*
news
upsets
me
almost
.
The
girl
seems
to
be
in
ignorance
.
Keep
her
so
*NL*
till
I
have
seen
you
.
M.
H.

*NL*
He
said
nothing
about
the
enclosure
of
five
guineas
.
The
amount
was
*NL*
significant
;
it
may
tacitly
have
said
to
her
that
he
bought
her
*NL*
back
again
.
She
waited
restlessly
for
the
close
of
the
day
,
telling
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
that
she
was
invited
to
see
Mr.
Henchard
;
that
she
would
*NL*
go
alone
.
But
she
said
nothing
to
show
that
the
place
of
meeting
was
not
*NL*
at
his
house
,
nor
did
she
hand
the
note
to
Elizabeth
.

The
Ring
at
Casterbridge
was
merely
the
local
name
of
one
of
the
finest
*NL*
Roman
Amphitheatres
,
if
not
the
very
finest
,
remaining
in
Britain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Casterbridge
announced
old
Rome
in
every
street
,
alley
,
and
precinct
.
*NL*
It
looked
Roman
,
bespoke
the
art
of
Rome
,
concealed
dead
men
of
Rome
.
It
*NL*
was
impossible
to
dig
more
than
a
foot
or
two
deep
about
the
town
*NL*
fields
and
gardens
without
coming
upon
some
tall
soldier
or
other
of
the
*NL*
Empire
,
who
had
lain
there
in
his
silent
unobtrusive
rest
for
a
space
of
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
years
.
He
was
mostly
found
lying
on
his
side
,
in
an
oval
*NL*
scoop
in
the
chalk
,
like
a
chicken
in
its
shell
;
his
knees
drawn
up
to
*NL*
his
chest
;
sometimes
with
the
remains
of
his
spear
against
his
arm
,
*NL*
a
fibula
or
brooch
of
bronze
on
his
breast
or
forehead
,
an
urn
at
*NL*
his
knees
,
a
jar
at
his
throat
,
a
bottle
at
his
mouth
;
and
mystified
*NL*
conjecture
pouring
down
upon
him
from
the
eyes
of
Casterbridge
street
*NL*
boys
and
men
,
who
had
turned
a
moment
to
gaze
at
the
familiar
spectacle
*NL*
as
they
passed
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imaginative
inhabitants
,
who
would
have
felt
an
unpleasantness
at
the
*NL*
discovery
of
a
comparatively
modern
skeleton
in
their
gardens
,
were
*NL*
quite
unmoved
by
these
hoary
shapes
.
They
had
lived
so
long
ago
,
their
*NL*
time
was
so
unlike
the
present
,
their
hopes
and
motives
were
so
widely
*NL*
removed
from
ours
,
that
between
them
and
the
living
there
seemed
to
*NL*
stretch
a
gulf
too
wide
for
even
a
spirit
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Amphitheatre
was
a
huge
circular
enclosure
,
with
a
notch
at
opposite
*NL*
extremities
of
its
diameter
north
and
south
.
From
its
sloping
internal
*NL*
form
it
might
have
been
called
the
spittoon
of
the
Jotuns
.
It
was
to
*NL*
Casterbridge
what
the
ruined
Coliseum
is
to
modern
Rome
,
and
was
nearly
*NL*
of
the
same
magnitude
.
The
dusk
of
evening
was
the
proper
hour
at
which
*NL*
a
true
impression
of
this
suggestive
place
could
be
received
.
Standing
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
at
that
time
there
by
degrees
became
apparent
*NL*
its
real
vastness
,
which
a
cursory
view
from
the
summit
at
noon-day
*NL*
was
apt
to
obscure
.
Melancholy
,
impressive
,
lonely
,
yet
accessible
from
*NL*
every
part
of
the
town
,
the
historic
circle
was
the
frequent
spot
for
*NL*
appointments
of
a
furtive
kind
.
Intrigues
were
arranged
there
;
tentative
*NL*
meetings
were
there
experimented
after
divisions
and
feuds
.
But
one
kind
*NL*
of
appointment
--
in
itself
the
most
common
of
any
--
seldom
had
place
in
*NL*
the
Amphitheatre
:
that
of
happy
lovers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
seeing
that
it
was
pre-eminently
an
airy
,
accessible
,
and
*NL*
sequestered
spot
for
interviews
,
the
cheerfullest
form
of
those
*NL*
occurrences
never
took
kindly
to
the
soil
of
the
ruin
,
would
be
a
*NL*
curious
inquiry
.
Perhaps
it
was
because
its
associations
had
about
them
*NL*
something
sinister
.
Its
history
proved
that
.
Apart
from
the
sanguinary
*NL*
nature
of
the
games
originally
played
therein
,
such
incidents
attached
*NL*
to
its
past
as
these
:
that
for
scores
of
years
the
town-gallows
had
*NL*
stood
at
one
corner
;
that
in
1705
a
woman
who
had
murdered
her
husband
*NL*
was
half-strangled
and
then
burnt
there
in
the
presence
of
ten
thousand
*NL*
spectators
.
Tradition
reports
that
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
burning
her
*NL*
heart
burst
and
leapt
out
of
her
body
,
to
the
terror
of
them
all
,
and
*NL*
that
not
one
of
those
ten
thousand
people
ever
cared
particularly
for
*NL*
hot
roast
after
that
.
In
addition
to
these
old
tragedies
,
pugilistic
*NL*
encounters
almost
to
the
death
had
come
off
down
to
recent
dates
in
that
*NL*
secluded
arena
,
entirely
invisible
to
the
outside
world
save
by
climbing
*NL*
to
the
top
of
the
enclosure
,
which
few
towns-people
in
the
daily
round
*NL*
of
their
lives
ever
took
the
trouble
to
do
.
So
that
,
though
close
to
the
*NL*
turnpike-road
,
crimes
might
be
perpetrated
there
unseen
at
mid-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
boys
had
latterly
tried
to
impart
gaiety
to
the
ruin
by
using
the
*NL*
central
arena
as
a
cricket-ground
.
But
the
game
usually
languished
*NL*
for
the
aforesaid
reason
--
the
dismal
privacy
which
the
earthen
circle
*NL*
enforced
,
shutting
out
every
appreciative
passer
's
vision
,
every
*NL*
commendatory
remark
from
outsiders
--
everything
,
except
the
sky
;
and
to
*NL*
play
at
games
in
such
circumstances
was
like
acting
to
an
empty
house
.
*NL*
Possibly
,
too
,
the
boys
were
timid
,
for
some
old
people
said
that
at
*NL*
certain
moments
in
the
summer
time
,
in
broad
daylight
,
persons
sitting
*NL*
with
a
book
or
dozing
in
the
arena
had
,
on
lifting
their
eyes
,
beheld
*NL*
the
slopes
lined
with
a
gazing
legion
of
Hadrian
's
soldiery
as
if
*NL*
watching
the
gladiatorial
combat
;
and
had
heard
the
roar
of
their
*NL*
excited
voices
,
that
the
scene
would
remain
but
a
moment
,
like
a
*NL*
lightning
flash
,
and
then
disappear
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
related
that
there
still
remained
under
the
south
entrance
*NL*
excavated
cells
for
the
reception
of
the
wild
animals
and
athletes
who
*NL*
took
part
in
the
games
.
The
arena
was
still
smooth
and
circular
,
as
if
*NL*
used
for
its
original
purpose
not
so
very
long
ago
.
The
sloping
pathways
*NL*
by
which
spectators
had
ascended
to
their
seats
were
pathways
yet
.
But
*NL*
the
whole
was
grown
over
with
grass
,
which
now
,
at
the
end
of
summer
,
*NL*
was
bearded
with
withered
bents
that
formed
waves
under
the
brush
of
the
*NL*
wind
,
returning
to
the
attentive
ear
aeolian
modulations
,
and
detaining
*NL*
for
moments
the
flying
globes
of
thistledown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
had
chosen
this
spot
as
being
the
safest
from
observation
which
*NL*
he
could
think
of
for
meeting
his
long-lost
wife
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
as
one
easily
to
be
found
by
a
stranger
after
nightfall
.
As
Mayor
of
the
*NL*
town
,
with
a
reputation
to
keep
up
,
he
could
not
invite
her
to
come
to
*NL*
his
house
till
some
definite
course
had
been
decided
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
eight
he
approached
the
deserted
earth-work
and
entered
by
*NL*
the
south
path
which
descended
over
the
debris
of
the
former
dens
.
In
*NL*
a
few
moments
he
could
discern
a
female
figure
creeping
in
by
the
great
*NL*
north
gap
,
or
public
gateway
.
They
met
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
.
*NL*
Neither
spoke
just
at
first
--
there
was
no
necessity
for
speech
--
and
the
*NL*
poor
woman
leant
against
Henchard
,
who
supported
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
drink
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
,
halting
,
apologetic
voice
.
``
You
hear
,
*NL*
Susan
?
--
I
do
n't
drink
now
--
I
have
n't
since
that
night
.
''
Those
were
his
*NL*
first
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
her
bow
her
head
in
acknowledgment
that
she
understood
.
After
a
*NL*
minute
or
two
he
again
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
known
you
were
living
,
Susan
!
But
there
was
every
reason
to
*NL*
suppose
you
and
the
child
were
dead
and
gone
.
I
took
every
possible
step
*NL*
to
find
you
--
travelled
--
advertised
.
My
opinion
at
last
was
that
you
*NL*
had
started
for
some
colony
with
that
man
,
and
had
been
drowned
on
your
*NL*
voyage
.
Why
did
you
keep
silent
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Michael
!
because
of
him
--
what
other
reason
could
there
be
?
I
thought
*NL*
I
owed
him
faithfulness
to
the
end
of
one
of
our
lives
--
foolishly
*NL*
I
believed
there
was
something
solemn
and
binding
in
the
bargain
;
I
*NL*
thought
that
even
in
honour
I
dared
not
desert
him
when
he
had
paid
so
*NL*
much
for
me
in
good
faith
.
I
meet
you
now
only
as
his
widow
--
I
consider
*NL*
myself
that
,
and
that
I
have
no
claim
upon
you
.
Had
he
not
died
I
should
*NL*
never
have
come
--
never
!
Of
that
you
may
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ts-s-s
!
How
could
you
be
so
simple
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Yet
it
would
have
been
very
wicked
--
if
I
had
not
thought
*NL*
like
that
!
''
said
Susan
,
almost
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
so
it
would
.
It
is
only
that
which
makes
me
feel
`
ee
an
*NL*
innocent
woman
.
But
--
to
lead
me
into
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Michael
?
''
she
asked
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
difficulty
about
our
living
together
again
,
and
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
.
She
can
not
be
told
all
--
she
would
so
despise
us
both
*NL*
that
--
I
could
not
bear
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
why
she
was
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
you
.
I
could
not
bear
*NL*
it
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
we
must
talk
of
a
plan
for
keeping
her
in
her
present
belief
,
and
*NL*
getting
matters
straight
in
spite
of
it
.
You
have
heard
I
am
in
a
large
*NL*
way
of
business
here
--
that
I
am
Mayor
of
the
town
,
and
churchwarden
,
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
things
,
as
well
as
the
dread
of
the
girl
discovering
our
*NL*
disgrace
,
makes
it
necessary
to
act
with
extreme
caution
.
So
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
how
you
two
can
return
openly
to
my
house
as
the
wife
and
*NL*
daughter
I
once
treated
badly
,
and
banished
from
me
;
and
there
's
the
rub
*NL*
o
`
t.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
away
at
once
.
I
only
came
to
see
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Susan
;
you
are
not
to
go
--
you
mistake
me
!
''
he
said
with
kindly
*NL*
severity
.
``
I
have
thought
of
this
plan
:
that
you
and
Elizabeth
take
a
*NL*
cottage
in
the
town
as
the
widow
Mrs.
Newson
and
her
daughter
;
that
I
*NL*
meet
you
,
court
you
,
and
marry
you
.
Elizabeth-Jane
coming
to
my
house
as
*NL*
my
step-daughter
.
The
thing
is
so
natural
and
easy
that
it
is
half
done
*NL*
in
thinking
o
`
t
.
This
would
leave
my
shady
,
headstrong
,
disgraceful
life
*NL*
as
a
young
man
absolutely
unopened
;
the
secret
would
be
yours
and
mine
*NL*
only
;
and
I
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
my
own
only
child
under
*NL*
my
roof
,
as
well
as
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
in
your
hands
,
Michael
,
''
she
said
meekly
.
``
I
came
here
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
Elizabeth
;
for
myself
,
if
you
tell
me
to
leave
again
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
,
and
never
come
near
you
more
,
I
am
content
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
now
;
we
do
n't
want
to
hear
that
,
''
said
Henchard
gently
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
you
wo
n't
leave
again
.
Think
over
the
plan
I
have
proposed
for
a
few
*NL*
hours
;
and
if
you
ca
n't
hit
upon
a
better
one
we
'll
adopt
it
.
I
have
*NL*
to
be
away
for
a
day
or
two
on
business
,
unfortunately
;
but
during
that
*NL*
time
you
can
get
lodgings
--
the
only
ones
in
the
town
fit
for
you
are
*NL*
those
over
the
china-shop
in
High
Street
--
and
you
can
also
look
for
a
*NL*
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
lodgings
are
in
High
Street
they
are
dear
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
--
you
MUST
start
genteel
if
our
plan
is
to
be
carried
out
.
*NL*
Look
to
me
for
money
.
Have
you
enough
till
I
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
comfortable
at
the
inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
girl
is
quite
safe
from
learning
the
shame
of
her
case
and
*NL*
ours
?
--
that
's
what
makes
me
most
anxious
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
be
surprised
to
find
how
unlikely
she
is
to
dream
of
the
*NL*
truth
.
How
could
she
ever
suppose
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
idea
of
repeating
our
marriage
,
''
said
Mrs.
Henchard
,
after
*NL*
a
pause
.
``
It
seems
the
only
right
course
,
after
all
this
.
Now
I
think
*NL*
I
must
go
back
to
Elizabeth-Jane
,
and
tell
her
that
our
kinsman
,
Mr.
*NL*
Henchard
,
kindly
wishes
us
to
stay
in
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
--
arrange
that
yourself
.
I
'll
go
some
way
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
Do
n't
run
any
risk
!
''
said
his
wife
anxiously
.
``
I
can
find
my
*NL*
way
back
--
it
is
not
late
.
Please
let
me
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
But
just
one
word
.
Do
you
forgive
me
,
Susan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
something
;
but
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
frame
her
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
--
all
in
good
time
,
''
said
he
.
``
Judge
me
by
my
future
*NL*
works
--
good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
retreated
,
and
stood
at
the
upper
side
of
the
Amphitheatre
while
his
*NL*
wife
passed
out
through
the
lower
way
,
and
descended
under
the
trees
to
*NL*
the
town
.
Then
Henchard
himself
went
homeward
,
going
so
fast
that
by
the
*NL*
time
he
reached
his
door
he
was
almost
upon
the
heels
of
the
unconscious
*NL*
woman
from
whom
he
had
just
parted
.
He
watched
her
up
the
street
,
and
*NL*
turned
into
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
12
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
his
own
door
after
watching
his
wife
out
of
sight
,
the
Mayor
*NL*
walked
on
through
the
tunnel-shaped
passage
into
the
garden
,
and
thence
*NL*
by
the
back
door
towards
the
stores
and
granaries
.
A
light
shone
from
*NL*
the
office-window
,
and
there
being
no
blind
to
screen
the
interior
*NL*
Henchard
could
see
Donald
Farfrae
still
seated
where
he
had
left
him
,
*NL*
initiating
himself
into
the
managerial
work
of
the
house
by
overhauling
*NL*
the
books
.
Henchard
entered
,
merely
observing
,
``
Do
n't
let
me
interrupt
*NL*
you
,
if
ye
will
stay
so
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
behind
Farfrae
's
chair
,
watching
his
dexterity
in
clearing
up
*NL*
the
numerical
fogs
which
had
been
allowed
to
grow
so
thick
in
Henchard
's
*NL*
books
as
almost
to
baffle
even
the
Scotchman
's
perspicacity
.
The
*NL*
corn-factor
's
mien
was
half
admiring
,
and
yet
it
was
not
without
a
dash
*NL*
of
pity
for
the
tastes
of
any
one
who
could
care
to
give
his
mind
to
*NL*
such
finnikin
details
.
Henchard
himself
was
mentally
and
physically
*NL*
unfit
for
grubbing
subtleties
from
soiled
paper
;
he
had
in
a
modern
*NL*
sense
received
the
education
of
Achilles
,
and
found
penmanship
a
*NL*
tantalizing
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
do
no
more
to-night
,
''
he
said
at
length
,
spreading
his
great
*NL*
hand
over
the
paper
.
``
There
's
time
enough
to-morrow
.
Come
indoors
with
*NL*
me
and
have
some
supper
.
Now
you
shall
!
I
am
determined
o
n't
.
''
He
shut
*NL*
the
account-books
with
friendly
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
Donald
had
wished
to
get
to
his
lodgings
;
but
he
already
saw
that
his
*NL*
friend
and
employer
was
a
man
who
knew
no
moderation
in
his
requests
and
*NL*
impulses
,
and
he
yielded
gracefully
.
He
liked
Henchard
's
warmth
,
even
if
*NL*
it
inconvenienced
him
;
the
great
difference
in
their
characters
adding
*NL*
to
the
liking
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
locked
up
the
office
,
and
the
young
man
followed
his
companion
*NL*
through
the
private
little
door
which
,
admitting
directly
into
*NL*
Henchard
's
garden
,
permitted
a
passage
from
the
utilitarian
to
the
*NL*
beautiful
at
one
step
.
The
garden
was
silent
,
dewy
,
and
full
of
*NL*
perfume
.
It
extended
a
long
way
back
from
the
house
,
first
as
lawn
and
*NL*
flower-beds
,
then
as
fruit-garden
,
where
the
long-tied
espaliers
,
as
old
*NL*
as
the
old
house
itself
,
had
grown
so
stout
,
and
cramped
,
and
gnarled
*NL*
that
they
had
pulled
their
stakes
out
of
the
ground
and
stood
distorted
*NL*
and
writhing
in
vegetable
agony
,
like
leafy
Laocoons
.
The
flowers
which
*NL*
smelt
so
sweetly
were
not
discernible
;
and
they
passed
through
them
into
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hospitalities
of
the
morning
were
repeated
,
and
when
they
were
over
*NL*
Henchard
said
,
``
Pull
your
chair
round
to
the
fireplace
,
my
dear
fellow
,
*NL*
and
let
's
make
a
blaze
--
there
's
nothing
I
hate
like
a
black
grate
,
even
*NL*
in
September
.
''
He
applied
a
light
to
the
laid-in
fuel
,
and
a
cheerful
*NL*
radiance
spread
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
odd
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
that
two
men
should
meet
as
we
have
done
on
*NL*
a
purely
business
ground
,
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
I
should
*NL*
wish
to
speak
to
`
ee
on
a
family
matter
.
But
,
damn
it
all
,
I
am
a
lonely
*NL*
man
,
Farfrae
:
I
have
nobody
else
to
speak
to
;
and
why
should
n't
I
tell
*NL*
it
to
`
ee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
if
I
can
be
of
any
service
,
''
said
Donald
,
*NL*
allowing
his
eyes
to
travel
over
the
intricate
wood-carvings
of
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
representing
garlanded
lyres
,
shields
,
and
quivers
,
on
*NL*
either
side
of
a
draped
ox-skull
,
and
flanked
by
heads
of
Apollo
and
*NL*
Diana
in
low
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
been
always
what
I
am
now
,
''
continued
Henchard
,
his
firm
deep
*NL*
voice
being
ever
so
little
shaken
.
He
was
plainly
under
that
strange
*NL*
influence
which
sometimes
prompts
men
to
confide
to
the
new-found
*NL*
friend
what
they
will
not
tell
to
the
old
.
``
I
began
life
as
a
working
*NL*
hay-trusser
,
and
when
I
was
eighteen
I
married
on
the
strength
o
'
my
*NL*
calling
.
Would
you
think
me
a
married
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
in
the
town
that
you
were
a
widower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
--
you
would
naturally
have
heard
that
.
Well
,
I
lost
my
wife
*NL*
nineteen
years
ago
or
so
--
by
my
own
fault
...
This
is
how
it
came
about
.
*NL*
One
summer
evening
I
was
travelling
for
employment
,
and
she
was
walking
*NL*
at
my
side
,
carrying
the
baby
,
our
only
child
.
We
came
to
a
booth
in
a
*NL*
country
fair
.
I
was
a
drinking
man
at
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
paused
a
moment
,
threw
himself
back
so
that
his
elbow
rested
*NL*
on
the
table
,
his
forehead
being
shaded
by
his
hand
,
which
,
however
,
did
*NL*
not
hide
the
marks
of
introspective
inflexibility
on
his
features
as
*NL*
he
narrated
in
fullest
detail
the
incidents
of
the
transaction
with
the
*NL*
sailor
.
The
tinge
of
indifference
which
had
at
first
been
visible
in
the
*NL*
Scotchman
now
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
went
on
to
describe
his
attempts
to
find
his
wife
;
the
oath
he
*NL*
swore
;
the
solitary
life
he
led
during
the
years
which
followed
.
``
I
have
*NL*
kept
my
oath
for
nineteen
years
,
''
he
went
on
;
``
I
have
risen
to
what
you
*NL*
see
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
no
wife
could
I
hear
of
in
all
that
time
;
and
being
by
nature
*NL*
something
of
a
woman-hater
,
I
have
found
it
no
hardship
to
keep
mostly
*NL*
at
a
distance
from
the
sex
.
No
wife
could
I
hear
of
,
I
say
,
till
this
*NL*
very
day
.
And
now
--
she
has
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
,
has
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
--
this
very
morning
.
And
what
's
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
ye
no
'
take
her
and
live
with
her
,
and
make
some
amends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
've
planned
and
proposed
.
But
,
Farfrae
,
''
said
Henchard
*NL*
gloomily
,
``
by
doing
right
with
Susan
I
wrong
another
innocent
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
do
n't
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
nature
of
things
,
Farfrae
,
it
is
almost
impossible
that
a
man
*NL*
of
my
sort
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
tide
through
twenty
years
o
'
*NL*
life
without
making
more
blunders
than
one
.
It
has
been
my
custom
*NL*
for
many
years
to
run
across
to
Jersey
in
the
the
way
of
business
,
*NL*
particularly
in
the
potato
and
root
season
.
I
do
a
large
trade
wi
'
them
*NL*
in
that
line
.
Well
,
one
autumn
when
stopping
there
I
fell
quite
ill
,
and
*NL*
in
my
illness
I
sank
into
one
of
those
gloomy
fits
I
sometimes
suffer
*NL*
from
,
on
account
o
'
the
loneliness
of
my
domestic
life
,
when
the
world
*NL*
seems
to
have
the
blackness
of
hell
,
and
,
like
Job
,
I
could
curse
the
*NL*
day
that
gave
me
birth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
now
,
I
never
feel
like
it
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
pray
to
God
that
you
never
may
,
young
man
.
While
in
this
state
I
*NL*
was
taken
pity
on
by
a
woman
--
a
young
lady
I
should
call
her
,
for
she
*NL*
was
of
good
family
,
well
bred
,
and
well
educated
--
the
daughter
of
some
*NL*
harum-scarum
military
officer
who
had
got
into
difficulties
,
and
had
his
*NL*
pay
sequestrated
.
He
was
dead
now
,
and
her
mother
too
,
and
she
was
as
*NL*
lonely
as
I
.
This
young
creature
was
staying
at
the
boarding-house
where
*NL*
I
happened
to
have
my
lodging
;
and
when
I
was
pulled
down
she
took
upon
*NL*
herself
to
nurse
me
.
From
that
she
got
to
have
a
foolish
liking
for
me
.
*NL*
Heaven
knows
why
,
for
I
was
n't
worth
it
.
But
being
together
in
the
same
*NL*
house
,
and
her
feeling
warm
,
we
got
naturally
intimate
.
I
wo
n't
go
into
*NL*
particulars
of
what
our
relations
were
.
It
is
enough
to
say
that
we
*NL*
honestly
meant
to
marry
.
There
arose
a
scandal
,
which
did
me
no
harm
,
*NL*
but
was
of
course
ruin
to
her
.
Though
,
Farfrae
,
between
you
and
me
,
as
*NL*
man
and
man
,
I
solemnly
declare
that
philandering
with
womankind
*NL*
has
neither
been
my
vice
nor
my
virtue
.
She
was
terribly
careless
of
*NL*
appearances
,
and
I
was
perhaps
more
,
because
o
'
my
dreary
state
;
and
it
*NL*
was
through
this
that
the
scandal
arose
.
At
last
I
was
well
,
and
came
*NL*
away
.
When
I
was
gone
she
suffered
much
on
my
account
,
and
did
n't
forget
*NL*
to
tell
me
so
in
letters
one
after
another
;
till
latterly
,
I
felt
I
*NL*
owed
her
something
,
and
thought
that
,
as
I
had
not
heard
of
Susan
for
so
*NL*
long
,
I
would
make
this
other
one
the
only
return
I
could
make
,
and
ask
*NL*
her
if
she
would
run
the
risk
of
Susan
being
alive
-LRB-
very
slight
as
I
*NL*
believed
-RRB-
and
marry
me
,
such
as
I
was
.
She
jumped
for
joy
,
and
we
should
*NL*
no
doubt
soon
have
been
married
--
but
,
behold
,
Susan
appears
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Donald
showed
his
deep
concern
at
a
complication
so
far
beyond
the
*NL*
degree
of
his
simple
experiences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
see
what
injury
a
man
may
cause
around
him
!
Even
after
that
*NL*
wrong-doing
at
the
fair
when
I
was
young
,
if
I
had
never
been
so
selfish
*NL*
as
to
let
this
giddy
girl
devote
herself
to
me
over
at
Jersey
,
to
the
*NL*
injury
of
her
name
,
all
might
now
be
well
.
Yet
,
as
it
stands
,
I
must
*NL*
bitterly
disappoint
one
of
these
women
;
and
it
is
the
second
.
My
first
*NL*
duty
is
to
Susan
--
there
's
no
doubt
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
both
in
a
very
melancholy
position
,

that
's
true
!

murmured
*NL*
Donald
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are

For
myself
I
do
n't
care

all
end
one
way

But
these
*NL*
two

''
Henchard
paused
in
reverie
.
``
I
feel
I
should
like
to
treat
the
*NL*
second

no
less
than
the
first

as

can
in
such
a
case

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
it
cannet

said
the
other
,
with
philosophic
*NL*
woefulness
.
``
You
mun
write
to
the
young
lady
,
and
in
your
letter
you
*NL*
must
put
it
plain
and
honest
that
it
turns
out
she
cannet
be
your
wife

*NL*
the
first
having
come
back

that
ye
cannet
see
her
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
do

I
must
do

must

brag
about
her
rich
uncle

rich
aunt

you
help
me
*NL*
in
this
,
and
draw
up
an
explanation
to

of
all
I

it

*NL*
``
And
I
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
have

My
wife
Susan
has
my
daughter
*NL*
with
her
--
the
baby
that
was
in
her
arms
at
the
fair
;
and
this
girl
knows
*NL*
nothing
of
me
beyond
that
I
am
some
sort
of
relation
by
marriage
.
She
*NL*
has
grown
up
in
the
belief
that
the
sailor
to
whom
I
made
over
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
who
is
now
dead
,
was
her
father
,
and
her
mother
's
husband
.
*NL*
What
her
mother
has
always
felt
,
she
and
I
together
feel
now
--
that
we
*NL*
ca
n't
proclaim
our
disgrace
to
the
girl
by
letting
her
know
the
truth
.
*NL*
Now
what
would
you
do
?
--
I
want
your
advice

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I

run
the
risk

tell
her
the
truth

She
'll
forgive
ye
*NL*
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
said
Henchard
.
``
I
am
not
going
to
let
her
know
the
truth

Her

mother

I
be
going

it
will
not
only
help
us
to
*NL*
keep
our
child

respect
,
but
it
will
be
more
proper
.
Susan
looks
upon
*NL*
herself
as
the
sailor
's
widow
,
and
wo
n't
think
o
'
living
with
me
as
*NL*
formerly
without
another
religious
ceremony

and
she
's
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
thereupon
said
no
more
.
The
letter
to
the
young
Jersey
woman
was
*NL*
carefully
framed
by
him
,
and
the
interview
ended
,
Henchard
saying
,
as
*NL*
the
Scotchman
left
,
``
I
feel
it
a
great
relief
,
Farfrae
,
to
tell
some
*NL*
friend
o

this
!
You
see
now
that
the
Mayor
of
Casterbridge
is
not
so
*NL*
thriving
in
his
mind
as
it
seems
he
might
be
from
the
state
of
his
*NL*
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
And
I
'm
sorry
for
ye

''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
Henchard
copied
the
letter
,
and
,
enclosing
a
cheque
,
*NL*
took
it
to
the
post-office
,
from
which
he
walked
back
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
that
it
will
go
off
so
easily
!
''
he
said
.
``
Poor
thing

God
*NL*
knows

Now
then

make
amends
to
Susan

*NL*
The
cottage
which
Michael
Henchard
hired
for
his
wife
Susan
under
her
*NL*
name
of
Newson
--
in
pursuance
of
their
plan
--
was
in
the
upper
or
western
*NL*
part
of
the
town
,
near
the
Roman
wall
,
and
the
avenue
which
overshadowed
*NL*
it
.
The
evening
sun
seemed
to
shine
more
yellowly
there
than
anywhere
*NL*
else
this
autumn
--
stretching
its
rays
,
as
the
hours
grew
later
,
under
*NL*
the
lowest
sycamore
boughs
,
and
steeping
the
ground-floor
of
the
*NL*
dwelling
,
with
its
green
shutters
,
in
a
substratum
of
radiance
which
the
*NL*
foliage
screened
from
the
upper
parts
.
Beneath
these
sycamores
on
the
*NL*
town
walls
could
be
seen
from
the
sitting-room
the
tumuli
and
earth
*NL*
forts
of
the
distant
uplands
;
making
it
altogether
a
pleasant
spot
,
with
*NL*
the
usual
touch
of
melancholy
that
a
past-marked
prospect
lends
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
mother
and
daughter
were
comfortably
installed
,
with
a
*NL*
white-aproned
servant
and
all
complete
,
Henchard
paid
them
a
visit
,
*NL*
and
remained
to
tea
.
During
the
entertainment
Elizabeth
was
carefully
*NL*
hoodwinked
by
the
very
general
tone
of
the
conversation
that
*NL*
prevailed
--
a
proceeding
which
seemed
to
afford
some
humour
to
Henchard
,
*NL*
though
his
wife
was
not
particularly
happy
in
it
.
The
visit
was
repeated
*NL*
again
and
again
with
business-like
determination
by
the
Mayor
,
who
*NL*
seemed
to
have
schooled
himself
into
a
course
of
strict
mechanical
*NL*
rightness
towards
this
woman
of
prior
claim
,
at
any
expense
to
the
later
*NL*
one
and
to
his
own
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
the
daughter
was
not
indoors
when
Henchard
came
,
and
he
*NL*
said
drily
,
``
This
is
a
very
good
opportunity
for
me
to
ask
you
to
name
*NL*
the
happy
day
,
Susan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
woman
smiled
faintly
;
she
did
not
enjoy
pleasantries
on
a
*NL*
situation
into
which
she
had
entered
solely
for
the
sake
of
her
girl
's
*NL*
reputation
.
She
liked
them
so
little
,
indeed
,
that
there
was
room
for
*NL*
wonder
why
she
had
countenanced
deception
at
all
,
and
had
not
bravely
*NL*
let
the
girl
know
her
history
.
But
the
flesh
is
weak
;
and
the
true
*NL*
explanation
came
in
due
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Michael
!
''
she
said
,
``
I
am
afraid
all
this
is
taking
up
your
time
and
*NL*
giving
trouble
--
when
I
did
not
expect
any
such
thing
!
''
And
she
looked
at
*NL*
him
and
at
his
dress
as
a
man
of
affluence
,
and
at
the
furniture
he
had
*NL*
provided
for
the
room
--
ornate
and
lavish
to
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Henchard
,
in
rough
benignity
.
``
This
is
only
a
*NL*
cottage
--
it
costs
me
next
to
nothing
.
And
as
to
taking
up
my
time
''
--
here
*NL*
his
red
and
black
visage
kindled
with
satisfaction
--
``
I
've
a
splendid
*NL*
fellow
to
superintend
my
business
now
--
a
man
whose
like
I
've
never
been
*NL*
able
to
lay
hands
on
before
.
I
shall
soon
be
able
to
leave
everything
*NL*
to
him
,
and
have
more
time
to
call
my
own
than
I
've
had
for
these
last
*NL*
twenty
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
visits
here
grew
so
frequent
and
so
regular
that
it
soon
*NL*
became
whispered
,
and
then
openly
discussed
in
Casterbridge
that
the
*NL*
masterful
,
coercive
Mayor
of
the
town
was
raptured
and
enervated
by
the
*NL*
genteel
widow
Mrs.
Newson
.
His
well-known
haughty
indifference
to
the
*NL*
society
of
womankind
,
his
silent
avoidance
of
converse
with
the
sex
,
*NL*
contributed
a
piquancy
to
what
would
otherwise
have
been
an
unromantic
*NL*
matter
enough
.
That
such
a
poor
fragile
woman
should
be
his
choice
was
*NL*
inexplicable
,
except
on
the
ground
that
the
engagement
was
a
family
*NL*
affair
in
which
sentimental
passion
had
no
place
;
for
it
was
known
that
*NL*
they
were
related
in
some
way
.
Mrs.
Henchard
was
so
pale
that
the
boys
*NL*
called
her
``
The
Ghost
.
''
Sometimes
Henchard
overheard
this
epithet
when
*NL*
they
passed
together
along
the
Walks
--
as
the
avenues
on
the
walls
*NL*
were
named
--
at
which
his
face
would
darken
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
destructiveness
towards
the
speakers
ominous
to
see
;
but
he
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
on
the
preparations
for
his
union
,
or
rather
reunion
,
with
*NL*
this
pale
creature
in
a
dogged
,
unflinching
spirit
which
did
credit
*NL*
to
his
conscientiousness
.
Nobody
would
have
conceived
from
his
outward
*NL*
demeanour
that
there
was
no
amatory
fire
or
pulse
of
romance
acting
as
*NL*
stimulant
to
the
bustle
going
on
in
his
gaunt
,
great
house
;
nothing
*NL*
but
three
large
resolves
--
one
,
to
make
amends
to
his
neglected
Susan
,
*NL*
another
,
to
provide
a
comfortable
home
for
Elizabeth-Jane
under
his
*NL*
paternal
eye
;
and
a
third
,
to
castigate
himself
with
the
thorns
which
*NL*
these
restitutory
acts
brought
in
their
train
;
among
them
the
lowering
*NL*
of
his
dignity
in
public
opinion
by
marrying
so
comparatively
humble
a
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Henchard
entered
a
carriage
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
when
*NL*
she
stepped
into
the
plain
brougham
which
drew
up
at
the
door
on
the
*NL*
wedding-day
to
take
her
and
Elizabeth-Jane
to
church
.
It
was
a
windless
*NL*
morning
of
warm
November
rain
,
which
floated
down
like
meal
,
and
lay
*NL*
in
a
powdery
form
on
the
nap
of
hats
and
coats
.
Few
people
had
*NL*
gathered
round
the
church
door
though
they
were
well
packed
within
.
*NL*
The
Scotchman
,
who
assisted
as
groomsman
,
was
of
course
the
only
one
*NL*
present
,
beyond
the
chief
actors
,
who
knew
the
true
situation
of
the
*NL*
contracting
parties
.
He
,
however
,
was
too
inexperienced
,
too
thoughtful
,
*NL*
too
judicial
,
too
strongly
conscious
of
the
serious
side
of
the
*NL*
business
,
to
enter
into
the
scene
in
its
dramatic
aspect
.
That
required
*NL*
the
special
genius
of
Christopher
Coney
,
Solomon
Longways
,
Buzzford
,
and
*NL*
their
fellows
.
But
they
knew
nothing
of
the
secret
;
though
,
as
the
*NL*
time
for
coming
out
of
church
drew
on
,
they
gathered
on
the
pavement
*NL*
adjoining
,
and
expounded
the
subject
according
to
their
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
five-and-forty
years
since
I
had
my
settlement
in
this
here
town
,
''
*NL*
said
Coney
;
``
but
daze
me
if
I
ever
see
a
man
wait
so
long
before
to
take
*NL*
so
little
!
There
's
a
chance
even
for
thee
after
this
,
Nance
Mockridge
.
''
*NL*
The
remark
was
addressed
to
a
woman
who
stood
behind
his
shoulder
--
the
*NL*
same
who
had
exhibited
Henchard
's
bad
bread
in
public
when
Elizabeth
and
*NL*
her
mother
entered
Casterbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
cust
if
I
'd
marry
any
such
as
he
,
or
thee
either
,
''
replied
that
*NL*
lady
.
``
As
for
thee
,
Christopher
,
we
know
what
ye
be
,
and
the
less

*NL*
the
better

as

lowering
her

would
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
he
's
worth
ever
so
much
a

murmured
Longways
.
``
When
a
*NL*
man
is
said
to
be
worth
so
much
a

's
a

considered

''
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
,
he
saw
a
circular
disc
reticulated
with
creases
,
and
recognized
*NL*
the
smiling
countenance
of
the
fat
woman
who
had
asked
for
another
song
*NL*
at
the
Three
Mariners
.
``
Well
,
Mother
Cuxsom

''
he
said
,
``
how
's
this
?
*NL*
Here

Mrs.

Cuxsom

*NL*
``
And

''
continued
Mrs.
*NL*
Cuxsom
,
kindling
at
the
retrospection
;
``
and
how
we
went
with
her
to
the

party
at
Mellstock

*NL*
*NL*
``

Christopher
Coney

*NL*
*NL*
``

was
getting
up

half
woman

as
one
may
say
.
And
canst
mind
''
--
she
*NL*
prodded
Solomon
's
shoulder
with
her
finger-tip
,
while
her
eyes
twinkled
*NL*
between
the
crevices
of
their
lids
--
``
canst
mind
the
sherry-wine
,
and
the
*NL*
zilver-snuffers
,
and
how
Joan
Dummett
was
took
bad
when
we
were
coming
*NL*
home
,
and
Jack
Griggs
was
forced
to
carry
her
through
the
mud
;
and
how
*NL*

a
let
her
fall
in
Dairyman
Sweet-apple
's
cow-barton
,
and
we
had
to
*NL*
clane
her
gown

grass

never
such
a
mess
as

were
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
that
I
do
--
hee-hee
,
such
doggery
as
there
was
in
them
ancient
days
,
*NL*
to
be
sure
!
Ah
,
the
miles
I
used
to
walk
then
;
and
now
I
can
hardly
step
*NL*
over
a
furrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
reminiscences
were
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
the
reunited
*NL*
pair
--
Henchard
looking
round
upon
the
idlers
with
that
ambiguous
gaze
*NL*
of
his
,
which
at
one
moment
seemed
to
mean
satisfaction
,
and
at
another
*NL*
fiery
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
there
's
a
difference
between
'em
,
though
he
do
call
himself
a
*NL*
teetotaller

''
said
Nance
Mockridge
.
``
She
'll
wish
her
cake
dough

There

out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stuff
--
he
's
well
enough
!
Some
folk

buttered

I
had
a

choice
as
wide
as
the
ocean

I
would

A
poor

twanking
woman
like
her

is
a
godsend

her

hardly
a

of
*NL*
jumps

night-rail

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
plain
little
brougham
drove
off
in
the
mist
,
and
the
idlers
*NL*
dispersed
.
``
Well
,
we
hardly
know
how
to
look
at
things
in
these
times
!
''
*NL*
said
Solomon
.
``
There
was
a
man
dropped
down
dead
yesterday

very
*NL*
many

*NL*
``
I
do

but
that
I
may
as
well
go
with

Christopher
;
``
I

as
clammy

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
Martinmas
summer
of
Mrs.
Henchard
's
life
set
in
with
her
entry
into
*NL*
her
husband
's
large
house
and
respectable
social
orbit
;
and
it
was
as
*NL*
bright
as
such
summers
well
can
be
.
Lest
she
should
pine
for
deeper
*NL*
affection
than
he
could
give
he
made
a
point
of
showing
some
semblance
*NL*
of
it
in
external
action
.
Among
other
things
he
had
the
iron
railings
,
*NL*
that
had
smiled
sadly
in
dull
rust
for
the
last
eighty
years
,
painted
*NL*
a
bright
green
,
and
the
heavy-barred
,
small-paned
Georgian
sash
windows
*NL*
enlivened
with
three
coats
of
white
.
He
was
as
kind
to
her
as
a
man
,
*NL*
mayor
,
and
churchwarden
could
possibly
be
.
The
house
was
large
,
the
*NL*
rooms
lofty
,
and
the
landings
wide
;
and
the
two
unassuming
women
*NL*
scarcely
made
a
perceptible
addition
to
its
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Elizabeth-Jane
the
time
was
a
most
triumphant
one
.
The
freedom
she
*NL*
experienced
,
the
indulgence
with
which
she
was
treated
,
went
beyond
her
*NL*
expectations
.
The
reposeful
,
easy
,
affluent
life
to
which
her
mother
's
*NL*
marriage
had
introduced
her
was
,
in
truth
,
the
beginning
of
a
great
*NL*
change
in
Elizabeth
.
She
found
she
could
have
nice
personal
possessions
*NL*
and
ornaments
for
the
asking
,
and
,
as
the
mediaeval
saying
puts
it
,
*NL*
``
Take
,
have
,
and
keep
,
are
pleasant
words
.
''
With
peace
of
mind
came
*NL*
development
,
and
with
development
beauty
.
Knowledge
--
the
result
of
great
*NL*
natural
insight
--
she
did
not
lack
;
learning
,
accomplishment
--
those
,
*NL*
alas
,
she
had
not
;
but
as
the
winter
and
spring
passed
by
her
thin
*NL*
face
and
figure
filled
out
in
rounder
and
softer
curves
;
the
lines
and
*NL*
contractions
upon
her
young
brow
went
away
;
the
muddiness
of
skin
which
*NL*
she
had
looked
upon
as
her
lot
by
nature
departed
with
a
change
to
*NL*
abundance
of
good
things
,
and
a
bloom
came
upon
her
cheek
.
Perhaps
,
too
,
*NL*
her
grey
,
thoughtful
eyes
revealed
an
arch
gaiety
sometimes
;
but
this
*NL*
was
infrequent
;
the
sort
of
wisdom
which
looked
from
their
pupils
did
*NL*
not
readily
keep
company
with
these
lighter
moods
.
Like
all
people
who
*NL*
have
known
rough
times
,
light-heartedness
seemed
to
her
too
irrational
*NL*
and
inconsequent
to
be
indulged
in
except
as
a
reckless
dram
now
and
*NL*
then
;
for
she
had
been
too
early
habituated
to
anxious
reasoning
to
drop
*NL*
the
habit
suddenly
.
She
felt
none
of
those
ups
and
downs
of
spirit
*NL*
which
beset
so
many
people
without
cause
;
never
--
to
paraphrase
a
recent
*NL*
poet
--
never
a
gloom
in
Elizabeth-Jane
's
soul
but
she
well
knew
how
it
*NL*
came
there
;
and
her
present
cheerfulness
was
fairly
proportionate
to
her
*NL*
solid
guarantees
for
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
supposed
that
,
given
a
girl
rapidly
becoming
*NL*
good-looking
,
comfortably
circumstanced
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
*NL*
life
commanding
ready
money
,
she
would
go
and
make
a
fool
of
herself
by
*NL*
dress
.
But
no
.
The
reasonableness
of
almost
everything
that
Elizabeth
*NL*
did
was
nowhere
more
conspicuous
than
in
this
question
of
clothes
.
To
*NL*
keep
in
the
rear
of
opportunity
in
matters
of
indulgence
is
as
valuable
*NL*
a
habit
as
to
keep
abreast
of
opportunity
in
matters
of
enterprise
.
This
*NL*
unsophisticated
girl
did
it
by
an
innate
perceptiveness
that
was
almost
*NL*
genius
.
Thus
she
refrained
from
bursting
out
like
a
water-flower
that
*NL*
spring
,
and
clothing
herself
in
puffings
and
knick-knacks
,
as
most
of
*NL*
the
Casterbridge
girls
would
have
done
in
her
circumstances
.
Her
triumph
*NL*
was
tempered
by
circumspection
,
she
had
still
that
field-mouse
fear
of
*NL*
the
coulter
of
destiny
despite
fair
promise
,
which
is
common
among
the
*NL*
thoughtful
who
have
suffered
early
from
poverty
and
oppression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
be
too
gay
on
any
account
,
''
she
would
say
to
herself
.
``
It
would
*NL*
be
tempting
Providence
to
hurl
mother
and
me
down
,
and
afflict
us
again
*NL*
as
He
used
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
see
her
in
a
black
silk
bonnet
,
velvet
mantle
or
silk
spencer
,
*NL*
dark
dress
,
and
carrying
a
sunshade
.
In
this
latter
article
she
drew
*NL*
the
line
at
fringe
,
and
had
it
plain
edged
,
with
a
little
ivory
ring
for
*NL*
keeping
it
closed
.
It
was
odd
about
the
necessity
for
that
sunshade
.
She
*NL*
discovered
that
with
the
clarification
of
her
complexion
and
the
birth
*NL*
of
pink
cheeks
her
skin
had
grown
more
sensitive
to
the
sun
's
rays
.
*NL*
She
protected
those
cheeks
forthwith
,
deeming
spotlessness
part
of
*NL*
womanliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
had
become
very
fond
of
her
,
and
she
went
out
with
him
more
*NL*
frequently
than
with
her
mother
now
.
Her
appearance
one
day
was
so
*NL*
attractive
that
he
looked
at
her
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
happened
to
have
the
ribbon
by
me
,
so
I
made
it
up
,
''
she
faltered
,
*NL*
thinking
him
perhaps
dissatisfied
with
some
rather
bright
trimming
she
*NL*
had
donned
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
of
course
--
to
be
sure
,
''
he
replied
in
his
leonine
way
.
``
Do
as
you
*NL*
like
--
or
rather
as
your
mother
advises
ye
.
`
Od
send
--
I
've
nothing
to
say
*NL*
to
`
t
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indoors
she
appeared
with
her
hair
divided
by
a
parting
that
arched
like
*NL*
a
white
rainbow
from
ear
to
ear
.
All
in
front
of
this
line
was
covered
*NL*
with
a
thick
encampment
of
curls
;
all
behind
was
dressed
smoothly
,
and
*NL*
drawn
to
a
knob
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
members
of
the
family
were
sitting
at
breakfast
one
day
,
and
*NL*
Henchard
was
looking
silently
,
as
he
often
did
,
at
this
head
of
*NL*
hair
,
which
in
colour
was
brown
--
rather
light
than
dark
.
``
I
thought
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
's
hair
--
did
n't
you
tell
me
that
Elizabeth-Jane
's
hair
*NL*
promised
to
be
black
when
she
was
a
baby
?
''
he
said
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
startled
,
jerked
his
foot
warningly
,
and
murmured
,
``
Did
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Elizabeth
was
gone
to
her
own
room
Henchard
resumed
.
``
Begad
,
*NL*
I
nearly
forgot
myself
just
now
!
What
I
meant
was
that
the
girl
's
hair
*NL*
certainly
looked
as
if
it
would
be
darker
,
when
she
was
a
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
;
but
they
alter
so
,
''
replied
Susan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
hair
gets
darker
,
I
know
--
but
I
was
n't
aware
it
lightened
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
.
''
And
the
same
uneasy
expression
came
out
on
her
face
,
to
which
*NL*
the
future
held
the
key
.
It
passed
as
Henchard
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
much
the
better
.
Now
Susan
,
I
want
to
have
her
called
*NL*
Miss
Henchard
--
not
Miss
Newson
.
Lots
o
'
people
do
it
already
in
*NL*
carelessness
--
it
is
her
legal
name
--
so
it
may
as
well
be
made
her
usual
*NL*
name
--
I
do
n't
like
t
`
other
name
at
all
for
my
own
flesh
and
blood
.
I
'll
*NL*
advertise
it
in
the
Casterbridge
paper
--
that
's
the
way
they
do
it
.
She
*NL*
wo
n't
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
O
no
.
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
shall
do
it
,
''
he
said
,
peremptorily
.
``
Surely
,
if
she
's
*NL*
willing
,
you
must
wish
it
as
much
as
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
--
if
she
agrees
let
us
do
it
by
all
means
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mrs.
Henchard
acted
somewhat
inconsistently
;
it
might
have
been
*NL*
called
falsely
,
but
that
her
manner
was
emotional
and
full
of
the
*NL*
earnestness
of
one
who
wishes
to
do
right
at
great
hazard
.
She
went
to
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
whom
she
found
sewing
in
her
own
sitting-room
upstairs
,
*NL*
and
told
her
what
had
been
proposed
about
her
surname
.
``
Can
you
*NL*
agree
--
is
it
not
a
slight
upon
Newson
--
now
he
's
dead
and
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
reflected
.
``
I
'll
think
of
it
,
mother
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
later
in
the
day
,
she
saw
Henchard
,
she
adverted
to
the
matter
*NL*
at
once
,
in
a
way
which
showed
that
the
line
of
feeling
started
by
her
*NL*
mother
had
been
persevered
in
.
``
Do
you
wish
this
change
so
very
much
,
*NL*
sir
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
it
?
Why
,
my
blessed
fathers
,
what
an
ado
you
women
make
about
*NL*
a
trifle
!
I
proposed
it
--
that
's
all
.
Now
,
`
Lizabeth-Jane
,
just
please
*NL*
yourself
.
Curse
me
if
I
care
what
you
do
.
Now
,
you
understand
,
do
n't
`
ee
*NL*
go
agreeing
to
it
to
please
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
subject
dropped
,
and
nothing
more
was
said
,
and
nothing
was
*NL*
done
,
and
Elizabeth
still
passed
as
Miss
Newson
,
and
not
by
her
legal
*NL*
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
great
corn
and
hay
traffic
conducted
by
Henchard
throve
*NL*
under
the
management
of
Donald
Farfrae
as
it
had
never
thriven
before
.
*NL*
It
had
formerly
moved
in
jolts
;
now
it
went
on
oiled
casters
.
The
old
*NL*
crude
viva
voce
system
of
Henchard
,
in
which
everything
depended
upon
*NL*
his
memory
,
and
bargains
were
made
by
the
tongue
alone
,
was
swept
*NL*
away
.
Letters
and
ledgers
took
the
place
of
``
I
'll
do
`
t
,
''
and
``
you
shall
*NL*
hae
`
t
''
;
and
,
as
in
all
such
cases
of
advance
,
the
rugged
picturesqueness
*NL*
of
the
old
method
disappeared
with
its
inconveniences
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
of
Elizabeth-Jane
's
room
--
rather
high
in
the
house
,
so
*NL*
that
it
commanded
a
view
of
the
hay-stores
and
granaries
across
the
*NL*
garden
--
afforded
her
opportunity
for
accurate
observation
of
what
went
*NL*
on
there
.
She
saw
that
Donald
and
Mr.
Henchard
were
inseparables
.
When
*NL*
walking
together
Henchard
would
lay
his
arm
familiarly
on
his
manager
's
*NL*
shoulder
,
as
if
Farfrae
were
a
younger
brother
,
bearing
so
heavily
that
*NL*
his
slight
frame
bent
under
the
weight
.
Occasionally
she
would
hear
*NL*
a
perfect
cannonade
of
laughter
from
Henchard
,
arising
from
something
*NL*
Donald
had
said
,
the
latter
looking
quite
innocent
and
not
laughing
at
*NL*
all
.
In
Henchard
's
somewhat
lonely
life
he
evidently
found
the
young
*NL*
man
as
desirable
for
comradeship
as
he
was
useful
for
consultations
.
*NL*
Donald
's
brightness
of
intellect
maintained
in
the
corn-factor
the
*NL*
admiration
it
had
won
at
the
first
hour
of
their
meeting
.
The
poor
*NL*
opinion
,
and
but
ill-concealed
,
that
he
entertained
of
the
*NL*
slim
Farfrae
's
physical
girth
,
strength
,
and
dash
was
more
than
*NL*
counterbalanced
by
the
immense
respect
he
had
for
his
brains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
quiet
eye
discerned
that
Henchard
's
tigerish
affection
for
the
*NL*
younger
man
,
his
constant
liking
to
have
Farfrae
near
him
,
now
and
then
*NL*
resulted
in
a
tendency
to
domineer
,
which
,
however
,
was
checked
in
a
*NL*
moment
when
Donald
exhibited
marks
of
real
offence
.
One
day
,
looking
*NL*
down
on
their
figures
from
on
high
,
she
heard
the
latter
remark
,
as
they
*NL*
stood
in
the
doorway
between
the
garden
and
yard
,
that
their
habit
of
*NL*
walking
and
driving
about
together
rather
neutralized
Farfrae
's
value
*NL*
as
a
second
pair
of
eyes
,
which
should
be
used
in
places
where
the
*NL*
principal
was
not
.
''
`
Od
damn
it
,
''
cried
Henchard
,
``
what
's
all
the
world
!
*NL*
I
like
a
fellow
to
talk
to
.
Now
come
along
and
hae
some
supper
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
take
too
much
thought
about
things
,
or
ye
'll
drive
me
crazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
walked
with
her
mother
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
often
beheld
the
*NL*
Scotchman
looking
at
them
with
a
curious
interest
.
The
fact
that
he
had
*NL*
met
her
at
the
Three
Mariners
was
insufficient
to
account
for
it
,
since
*NL*
on
the
occasions
on
which
she
had
entered
his
room
he
had
never
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
.
Besides
,
it
was
at
her
mother
more
particularly
than
*NL*
at
herself
that
he
looked
,
to
Elizabeth-Jane
's
half-conscious
,
*NL*
simple-minded
,
perhaps
pardonable
,
disappointment
.
Thus
she
could
not
*NL*
account
for
this
interest
by
her
own
attractiveness
,
and
she
decided
*NL*
that
it
might
be
apparent
only
--
a
way
of
turning
his
eyes
that
Mr.
*NL*
Farfrae
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
divine
the
ample
explanation
of
his
manner
,
without
personal
*NL*
vanity
,
that
was
afforded
by
the
fact
of
Donald
being
the
depositary
*NL*
of
Henchard
's
confidence
in
respect
of
his
past
treatment
of
the
pale
,
*NL*
chastened
mother
who
walked
by
her
side
.
Her
conjectures
on
that
past
*NL*
never
went
further
than
faint
ones
based
on
things
casually
heard
and
*NL*
seen
--
mere
guesses
that
Henchard
and
her
mother
might
have
been
lovers
*NL*
in
their
younger
days
,
who
had
quarrelled
and
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Casterbridge
,
as
has
been
hinted
,
was
a
place
deposited
in
the
*NL*
block
upon
a
corn-field
.
There
was
no
suburb
in
the
modern
sense
,
or
*NL*
transitional
intermixture
of
town
and
down
.
It
stood
,
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
wide
fertile
land
adjoining
,
clean-cut
and
distinct
,
like
a
chess-board
*NL*
on
a
green
tablecloth
.
The
farmer
's
boy
could
sit
under
his
barley-mow
*NL*
and
pitch
a
stone
into
the
office-window
of
the
town-clerk
;
reapers
*NL*
at
work
among
the
sheaves
nodded
to
acquaintances
standing
on
the
*NL*
pavement-corner
;
the
red-robed
judge
,
when
he
condemned
a
sheep-stealer
,
*NL*
pronounced
sentence
to
the
tune
of
Baa
,
that
floated
in
at
the
window
*NL*
from
the
remainder
of
the
flock
browsing
hard
by
;
and
at
executions
*NL*
the
waiting
crowd
stood
in
a
meadow
immediately
before
the
drop
,
out
of
*NL*
which
the
cows
had
been
temporarily
driven
to
give
the
spectators
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corn
grown
on
the
upland
side
of
the
borough
was
garnered
by
farmers
*NL*
who
lived
in
an
eastern
purlieu
called
Durnover
.
Here
wheat-ricks
*NL*
overhung
the
old
Roman
street
,
and
thrust
their
eaves
against
the
church
*NL*
tower
;
green-thatched
barns
,
with
doorways
as
high
as
the
gates
of
*NL*
Solomon
's
temple
,
opened
directly
upon
the
main
thoroughfare
.
Barns
*NL*
indeed
were
so
numerous
as
to
alternate
with
every
half-dozen
houses
*NL*
along
the
way
.
Here
lived
burgesses
who
daily
walked
the
fallow
;
*NL*
shepherds
in
an
intra-mural
squeeze
.
A
street
of
farmers
'
homesteads
--
a
*NL*
street
ruled
by
a
mayor
and
corporation
,
yet
echoing
with
the
thump
of
*NL*
the
flail
,
the
flutter
of
the
winnowing-fan
,
and
the
purr
of
the
milk
*NL*
into
the
pails
--
a
street
which
had
nothing
urban
in
it
whatever
--
this
*NL*
was
the
Durnover
end
of
Casterbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
,
as
was
natural
,
dealt
largely
with
this
nursery
or
bed
of
*NL*
small
farmers
close
at
hand
--
and
his
waggons
were
often
down
that
way
.
*NL*
One
day
,
when
arrangements
were
in
progress
for
getting
home
corn
from
*NL*
one
of
the
aforesaid
farms
,
Elizabeth-Jane
received
a
note
by
hand
,
*NL*
asking
her
to
oblige
the
writer
by
coming
at
once
to
a
granary
on
*NL*
Durnover
Hill
.
As
this
was
the
granary
whose
contents
Henchard
was
*NL*
removing
,
she
thought
the
request
had
something
to
do
with
his
business
,
*NL*
and
proceeded
thither
as
soon
as
she
had
put
on
her
bonnet
.
The
granary
*NL*
was
just
within
the
farm-yard
,
and
stood
on
stone
staddles
,
high
enough
*NL*
for
persons
to
walk
under
.
The
gates
were
open
,
but
nobody
was
within
.
*NL*
However
,
she
entered
and
waited
.
Presently
she
saw
a
figure
approaching
*NL*
the
gate
--
that
of
Donald
Farfrae
.
He
looked
up
at
the
church
clock
,
and
*NL*
came
in
.
By
some
unaccountable
shyness
,
some
wish
not
to
meet
him
there
*NL*
alone
,
she
quickly
ascended
the
step-ladder
leading
to
the
granary
*NL*
door
,
and
entered
it
before
he
had
seen
her
.
Farfrae
advanced
,
imagining
*NL*
himself
in
solitude
,
and
a
few
drops
of
rain
beginning
to
fall
he
moved
*NL*
and
stood
under
the
shelter
where
she
had
just
been
standing
.
Here
he
*NL*
leant
against
one
of
the
staddles
,
and
gave
himself
up
to
patience
.
He
,
*NL*
too
,
was
plainly
expecting
some
one
;
could
it
be
herself
?
If
so
,
why
?
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
then
pulled
out
a
note
,
a
*NL*
duplicate
of
the
one
she
had
herself
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
situation
began
to
be
very
awkward
,
and
the
longer
she
waited
the
*NL*
more
awkward
it
became
.
To
emerge
from
a
door
just
above
his
head
and
*NL*
descend
the
ladder
,
and
show
she
had
been
in
hiding
there
,
would
look
so
*NL*
very
foolish
that
she
still
waited
on
.
A
winnowing
machine
stood
close
*NL*
beside
her
,
and
to
relieve
her
suspense
she
gently
moved
the
handle
;
*NL*
whereupon
a
cloud
of
wheat
husks
flew
out
into
her
face
,
and
covered
*NL*
her
clothes
and
bonnet
,
and
stuck
into
the
fur
of
her
victorine
.
He
must
*NL*
have
heard
the
slight
movement
for
he
looked
up
,
and
then
ascended
the
*NL*
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
it
's
Miss
Newson
,
''
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
see
into
the
*NL*
granary
.
``
I
did
n't
know
you
were
there
.
I
have
kept
the
appointment
,
and
*NL*
am
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Mr.
Farfrae
,
''
she
faltered
,
``
so
have
I
.
But
I
did
n't
know
it
was
you
*NL*
who
wished
to
see
me
,
otherwise
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
see
you
?
O
no
--
at
least
,
that
is
,
I
am
afraid
there
may
be
*NL*
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
ask
me
to
come
here
?
Did
n't
you
write
this
?
''
Elizabeth
held
*NL*
out
her
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Indeed
,
at
no
hand
would
I
have
thought
of
it
!
And
for
you
--
did
n't
*NL*
you
ask
me
?
This
is
not
your
writing
?
''
And
he
held
up
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
really
so
!
Then
it
's
somebody
wanting
to
see
us
both
.
*NL*
Perhaps
we
would
do
well
to
wait
a
little
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Acting
on
this
consideration
they
lingered
,
Elizabeth-Jane
's
face
being
*NL*
arranged
to
an
expression
of
preternatural
composure
,
and
the
young
*NL*
Scot
,
at
every
footstep
in
the
street
without
,
looking
from
under
the
*NL*
granary
to
see
if
the
passer
were
about
to
enter
and
declare
himself
*NL*
their
summoner
.
They
watched
individual
drops
of
rain
creeping
down
the
*NL*
thatch
of
the
opposite
rick
--
straw
after
straw
--
till
they
reached
the
*NL*
bottom
;
but
nobody
came
,
and
the
granary
roof
began
to
drip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
person
is
not
likely
to
be
coming
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
It
's
a
trick
*NL*
perhaps
,
and
if
so
,
it
's
a
great
pity
to
waste
our
time
like
this
,
and
*NL*
so
much
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
great
liberty
,
''
said
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
Miss
Newson
.
We
'll
hear
news
of
this
some
day
depend
o
n't
,
*NL*
and
who
it
was
that
did
it
.
I
would
n't
stand
for
it
hindering
myself
;
*NL*
but
you
,
Miss
Newson

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind

much

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
lapsed
again
into
silence
.
``
You
are
anxious
to
get
back
to
*NL*
Scotland
,
I
suppose
,
Mr.
Farfrae
?

she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
Miss
Newson
.
Why
would
I
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
supposed
you
might
be
from
the
song
you
sang
at
the
Three
*NL*
Mariners
--
about
Scotland
and
home
,
I
mean
--
which
you
seemed
to
feel
so
*NL*
deep
down
in
your
heart
;
so
that
we
all
felt
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
and
I
did
sing
there
--
I
did
--
But
,
Miss
Newson
''
--
and
Donald
's
*NL*
voice
musically
undulated
between
two
semi-tones
as
it
always
did
when
*NL*
he
became
earnest
--
``
it
's
well
you
feel
a
song
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
*NL*
your
eyes
they
get
quite
tearful
;
but
you
finish
it
,
and
for
all
you
*NL*
felt
you
do
n't
mind
it
or
think
of
it
again
for
a
long
while
.
O
no
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
go
back
!
Yet
I
'll
sing
the
song
to
you
wi
'
pleasure
*NL*
whenever
you
like
.
I
could
sing
it
now
,
and
not
mind
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
indeed
.
But
I
fear
I
must
go
--
rain
or
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
Then
,
Miss
Newson
,
ye
had
better
say
nothing
about
this
hoax
,
and
*NL*
take
no
heed
of
it
.
And
if
the
person
should
say
anything
to
you
,
be
*NL*
civil
to
him
or
her
,
as
if
you
did
not
mind
it
--
so
you
'll
take
the
*NL*
clever
person
's
laugh
away
.
''
In
speaking
his
eyes
became
fixed
upon
*NL*
her
dress
,
still
sown
with
wheat
husks
.
``
There
's
husks
and
dust
on
you
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
do
n't
know
it
?
''
he
said
,
in
tones
of
extreme
delicacy
.
``
And
*NL*
it
's
very
bad
to
let
rain
come
upon
clothes
when
there
's
chaff
on
them
.
*NL*
It
washes
in
and
spoils
them
.
Let
me
help
you
--
blowing
is
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Elizabeth
neither
assented
nor
dissented
Donald
Farfrae
began
blowing
*NL*
her
back
hair
,
and
her
side
hair
,
and
her
neck
,
and
the
crown
of
her
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
the
fur
of
her
victorine
,
Elizabeth
saying
,
``
O
,
thank
you
,
''
*NL*
at
every
puff
.
At
last
she
was
fairly
clean
,
though
Farfrae
,
having
got
*NL*
over
his
first
concern
at
the
situation
,
seemed
in
no
manner
of
hurry
to
*NL*
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
now
I
'll
go
and
get
ye
an
umbrella
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
declined
the
offer
,
stepped
out
and
was
gone
.
Farfrae
walked
slowly
*NL*
after
,
looking
thoughtfully
at
her
diminishing
figure
,
and
whistling
in
*NL*
undertones
,
``
As
I
came
down
through
Cannobie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
15
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Miss
Newson
's
budding
beauty
was
not
regarded
with
much
*NL*
interest
by
anybody
in
Casterbridge
.
Donald
Farfrae
's
gaze
,
it
is
true
,
*NL*
was
now
attracted
by
the
Mayor
's
so-called
step-daughter
,
but
he
was
*NL*
only
one
.
The
truth
is
that
she
was
but
a
poor
illustrative
instance
of
*NL*
the
prophet
Baruch
's
sly
definition
:
``
The
virgin
that
loveth
to
go
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
walked
abroad
she
seemed
to
be
occupied
with
an
inner
chamber
*NL*
of
ideas
,
and
to
have
slight
need
for
visible
objects
.
She
formed
*NL*
curious
resolves
on
checking
gay
fancies
in
the
matter
of
clothes
,
*NL*
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
her
past
life
to
blossom
gaudily
the
*NL*
moment
she
had
become
possessed
of
money
.
But
nothing
is
more
insidious
*NL*
than
the
evolution
of
wishes
from
mere
fancies
,
and
of
wants
from
mere
*NL*
wishes
.
Henchard
gave
Elizabeth-Jane
a
box
of
delicately-tinted
gloves
*NL*
one
spring
day
.
She
wanted
to
wear
them
to
show
her
appreciation
of
his
*NL*
kindness
,
but
she
had
no
bonnet
that
would
harmonize
.
As
an
artistic
*NL*
indulgence
she
thought
she
would
have
such
a
bonnet
.
When
she
had
a
*NL*
bonnet
that
would
go
with
the
gloves
she
had
no
dress
that
would
go
with
*NL*
the
bonnet
.
It
was
now
absolutely
necessary
to
finish
;
she
ordered
the
*NL*
requisite
article
,
and
found
that
she
had
no
sunshade
to
go
with
the
*NL*
dress
.
In
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
;
she
bought
the
sunshade
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
structure
was
at
last
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
attracted
,
and
some
said
that
her
bygone
simplicity
was
*NL*
the
art
that
conceals
art
,
the
``
delicate
imposition
''
of
Rochefoucauld
;
*NL*
she
had
produced
an
effect
,
a
contrast
,
and
it
had
been
done
on
purpose
.
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
not
true
,
but
it
had
its
result
;
for
as
*NL*
soon
as
Casterbridge
thought
her
artful
it
thought
her
worth
notice
.
``
It
*NL*
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
have
been
so
much
admired
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
herself
;
``
though
perhaps
it
is
by
those
whose
admiration
is
not
worth
*NL*
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Donald
Farfrae
admired
her
,
too
;
and
altogether
the
time
was
an
*NL*
exciting
one
;
sex
had
never
before
asserted
itself
in
her
so
strongly
,
*NL*
for
in
former
days
she
had
perhaps
been
too
impersonally
human
to
be
*NL*
distinctively
feminine
.
After
an
unprecedented
success
one
day
she
came
*NL*
indoors
,
went
upstairs
,
and
leant
upon
her
bed
face
downwards
quite
*NL*
forgetting
the
possible
creasing
and
damage
.
``
Good
Heaven
,
''
she
*NL*
whispered
,
``
can
it
be
?
Here
am
I
setting
up
as
the
town
beauty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
thought
it
over
,
her
usual
fear
of
exaggerating
appearances
*NL*
engendered
a
deep
sadness
.
``
There
is
something
wrong
in
all
this
,
''
she
*NL*
mused
.
``
If
they
only
knew
what
an
unfinished
girl
I
am
--
that
I
ca
n't
*NL*
talk
Italian
,
or
use
globes
,
or
show
any
of
the
accomplishments
they
*NL*
learn
at
boarding
schools
,
how
they
would
despise
me
!
Better
sell
all
*NL*
this
finery
and
buy
myself
grammar-books
and
dictionaries
and
a
history
*NL*
of
all
the
philosophies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
from
the
window
and
saw
Henchard
and
Farfrae
in
the
hay-yard
*NL*
talking
,
with
that
impetuous
cordiality
on
the
Mayor
's
part
,
and
genial
*NL*
modesty
on
the
younger
man
's
,
that
was
now
so
generally
observable
*NL*
in
their
intercourse
.
Friendship
between
man
and
man
;
what
a
rugged
*NL*
strength
there
was
in
it
,
as
evinced
by
these
two
.
And
yet
the
seed
that
*NL*
was
to
lift
the
foundation
of
this
friendship
was
at
that
moment
taking
*NL*
root
in
a
chink
of
its
structure
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
six
o'clock
;
the
men
were
dropping
off
homeward
one
by
one
.
*NL*
The
last
to
leave
was
a
round-shouldered
,
blinking
young
man
of
nineteen
*NL*
or
twenty
,
whose
mouth
fell
ajar
on
the
slightest
provocation
,
seemingly
*NL*
because
there
was
no
chin
to
support
it
.
Henchard
called
aloud
to
him
as
*NL*
he
went
out
of
the
gate
,
``
Here
--
Abel
Whittle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whittle
turned
,
and
ran
back
a
few
steps
.
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
in
*NL*
breathless
deprecation
,
as
if
he
knew
what
was
coming
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more
--
be
in
time
to-morrow
morning
.
You
see
what
's
to
be
done
,
and
*NL*
you
hear
what
I
say
,
and
you
know
I
'm
not
going
to
be
trifled
with
any
*NL*
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
Then
Abel
Whittle
left
,
and
Henchard
and
Farfrae
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
saw
no
more
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
was
good
reason
for
this
command
on
Henchard
's
part
.
Poor
*NL*
Abel
,
as
he
was
called
,
had
an
inveterate
habit
of
over-sleeping
himself
*NL*
and
coming
late
to
his
work
.
His
anxious
will
was
to
be
among
the
*NL*
earliest
;
but
if
his
comrades
omitted
to
pull
the
string
that
he
always
*NL*
tied
round
his
great
toe
and
left
hanging
out
the
window
for
that
*NL*
purpose
,
his
will
was
as
wind
.
He
did
not
arrive
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
often
second
hand
at
the
hay-weighing
,
or
at
the
crane
which
*NL*
lifted
the
sacks
,
or
was
one
of
those
who
had
to
accompany
the
waggons
*NL*
into
the
country
to
fetch
away
stacks
that
had
been
purchased
,
this
*NL*
affliction
of
Abel
's
was
productive
of
much
inconvenience
.
For
two
*NL*
mornings
in
the
present
week
he
had
kept
the
others
waiting
nearly
an
*NL*
hour
;
hence
Henchard
's
threat
.
It
now
remained
to
be
seen
what
would
*NL*
happen
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
o'clock
struck
,
and
there
was
no
Whittle
.
At
half-past
six
Henchard
*NL*
entered
the
yard
;
the
waggon
was
horsed
that
Abel
was
to
accompany
;
and
*NL*
the
other
man
had
been
waiting
twenty
minutes
.
Then
Henchard
swore
,
and
*NL*
Whittle
coming
up
breathless
at
that
instant
,
the
corn-factor
turned
on
*NL*
him
,
and
declared
with
an
oath
that
this
was
the
last
time
;
that
if
he
*NL*
were
behind
once
more
,
by
God
,
he
would
come
and
drag
him
out
o
'
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
sommit
wrong
in
my
make
,
your
worshipful
!
''
said
Abel
,
*NL*
``
especially
in
the
inside
,
whereas
my
poor
dumb
brain
gets
as
dead
as
*NL*
a
clot
afore
I
've
said
my
few
scrags
of
prayers
.
Yes
--
it
came
on
as
a
*NL*
stripling
,
just
afore
I
'd
got
man
's
wages
,
whereas
I
never
enjoy
my
bed
*NL*
at
all
,
for
no
sooner
do
I
lie
down
than
I
be
asleep
,
and
afore
I
be
*NL*
awake
I
be
up
.
I
've
fretted
my
gizzard
green
about
it
,
maister
,
but
what
*NL*
can
I
do
?
Now
last
night
,
afore
I
went
to
bed
,
I
only
had
a
scantling
o
'
*NL*
cheese
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
!
''
roared
Henchard
.
``
To-morrow
the
waggons
must
*NL*
start
at
four
,
and
if
you
're
not
here
,
stand
clear
.
I
'll
mortify
thy
*NL*
flesh
for
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
me
clear
up
my
points
,
your
worshipful
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
asked
me
and
he
questioned
me
,
and
then
'
a
would
n't
hear
my
*NL*
points
!
''
said
Abel
,
to
the
yard
in
general
.
``
Now
,
I
shall
twitch
like
a
*NL*
moment-hand
all
night
to-night
for
fear
o
'
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
journey
to
be
taken
by
the
waggons
next
day
was
a
long
one
into
*NL*
Blackmoor
Vale
,
and
at
four
o'clock
lanterns
were
moving
about
the
yard
.
*NL*
But
Abel
was
missing
.
Before
either
of
the
other
men
could
run
to
Abel
's
*NL*
and
warn
him
Henchard
appeared
in
the
garden
doorway
.
``
Where
's
Abel
*NL*
Whittle
?
Not
come
after
all
I
've
said
?
Now
I
'll
carry
out
my
word
,
by
*NL*
my
blessed
fathers
--
nothing
else
will
do
him
any
good
!
I
'm
going
up
that
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
went
off
,
entered
Abel
's
house
,
a
little
cottage
in
Back
*NL*
Street
,
the
door
of
which
was
never
locked
because
the
inmates
had
*NL*
nothing
to
lose
.
Reaching
Whittle
's
bedside
the
corn-factor
shouted
a
*NL*
bass
note
so
vigorously
that
Abel
started
up
instantly
,
and
beholding
*NL*
Henchard
standing
over
him
,
was
galvanized
into
spasmodic
movements
*NL*
which
had
not
much
relation
to
getting
on
his
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
bed
,
sir
,
and
off
to
the
granary
,
or
you
leave
my
employ
to-day
!
*NL*
'T
is
to
teach
ye
a
lesson
.
March
on
;
never
mind
your
breeches
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
Whittle
threw
on
his
sleeve
waistcoat
,
and
managed
to
get
*NL*
into
his
boots
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
while
Henchard
thrust
his
*NL*
hat
over
his
head
.
Whittle
then
trotted
on
down
Back
Street
,
Henchard
*NL*
walking
sternly
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
this
time
Farfrae
,
who
had
been
to
Henchard
's
house
to
look
for
*NL*
him
,
came
out
of
the
back
gate
,
and
saw
something
white
fluttering
in
*NL*
the
morning
gloom
,
which
he
soon
perceived
to
be
part
of
Abel
's
shirt
*NL*
that
showed
below
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
maircy
's
sake
,
what
object
's
this
?
''
said
Farfrae
,
following
Abel
*NL*
into
the
yard
,
Henchard
being
some
way
in
the
rear
by
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
see
,
Mr.
Farfrae
,
''
gibbered
Abel
with
a
resigned
smile
of
terror
,
*NL*
``
he
said
he
'd
mortify
my
flesh
if
so
be
I
did
n't
get
up
sooner
,
and
now
*NL*
he
's
a-doing
o
n't
!
Ye
see
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
Mr.
Farfrae
;
things
do
*NL*
happen
queer
sometimes
!
Yes
--
I
'll
go
to
Blackmoor
Vale
half
naked
as
*NL*
I
be
,
since
he
do
command
;
but
I
shall
kill
myself
afterwards
;
I
ca
n't
*NL*
outlive
the
disgrace
,
for
the
women-folk
will
be
looking
out
of
their
*NL*
winders
at
my
mortification
all
the
way
along
,
and
laughing
me
to
scorn
*NL*
as
a
man

ithout
breeches

You
know
how
I
feel
such
things

Maister

Farfrae

how
forlorn
thoughts

Yes

coming
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
back

slip
on
your

and
come
to
wark
like
a
man

ye
go
not

you
'll
ha'e
your
death
standing
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afeard

Mr.
Henchard
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
what
Mr.
Henchard
said
,
nor
anybody

'T

do
this

Go
and
dress
yourself
instantly
Whittle

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
hullo

''
said
Henchard
,
coming
up
behind
.
``
Who
's
sending
him
*NL*
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
men
looked
towards
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
Donald
.
``
I
say
this
joke
has
been
carried
far
enough
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
say
it
has
n't

Get
up
in
the
waggon
,
Whittle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
I
am
manager
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
He
either
goes
home
,
or
I
march
*NL*
out
of
this
yard
for
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
looked
at
him
with
a
face
stern
and
red
.
But
he
paused
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
and
their
eyes
met
.
Donald
went
up
to
him
,
for
he
saw
in
*NL*
Henchard
's
look
that
he
began
to
regret
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Donald
quietly
,
``
a
man
o
'
your
position
should
ken
better
,
*NL*
sir
!
It
is
tyrannical
and
no
worthy
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
not
tyrannical
!
''
murmured
Henchard
,
like
a
sullen
boy
.
``
It
is
to
*NL*
make
him
remember
!
''
He
presently
added
,
in
a
tone
of
one
bitterly
hurt
:
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
speak
to
me
before
them
like
that
,
Farfrae
?
You
might
have
*NL*
stopped
till
we
were
alone
.
Ah
--
I
know
why
!
I
've
told
ye
the
secret
o
'
*NL*
my
life
--
fool
that
I
was
to
do
`
t
--
and
you
take
advantage
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
forgot
it
,
''
said
Farfrae
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
looked
on
the
ground
,
said
nothing
more
,
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
During
the
day
Farfrae
learnt
from
the
men
that
Henchard
had
kept
Abel
's
*NL*
old
mother
in
coals
and
snuff
all
the
previous
winter
,
which
made
him
*NL*
less
antagonistic
to
the
corn-factor
.
But
Henchard
continued
moody
and
*NL*
silent
,
and
when
one
of
the
men
inquired
of
him
if
some
oats
should
be
*NL*
hoisted
to
an
upper
floor
or
not
,
he
said
shortly
,
``
Ask
Mr.
Farfrae
.
*NL*
He
's
master
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morally
he
was
;
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
Henchard
,
who
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
the
most
admired
man
in
his
circle
,
was
the
most
admired
*NL*
no
longer
.
One
day
the
daughters
of
a
deceased
farmer
in
Durnover
wanted
*NL*
an
opinion
of
the
value
of
their
haystack
,
and
sent
a
messenger
to
ask
*NL*
Mr.
Farfrae
to
oblige
them
with
one
.
The
messenger
,
who
was
a
child
,
met
*NL*
in
the
yard
not
Farfrae
,
but
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
please
will
Mr.
Farfrae
come
?
''
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
that
way
...
Why
Mr.
Farfrae
?
''
said
Henchard
,
with
the
fixed
*NL*
look
of
thought
.
``
Why
do
people
always
want
Mr.
Farfrae
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
because
they
like
him
so
--
that
's
what
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
see
--
that
's
what
they
say
--
hey
?
They
like
him
because
he
's
*NL*
cleverer
than
Mr.
Henchard
,
and
because
he
knows
more
;
and
,
in
short
,
*NL*
Mr.
Henchard
ca
n't
hold
a
candle
to
him
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
's
just
it
,
sir
--
some
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
's
more
?
Of
course
there
's
more
!
What
besides
?
Come
,
here
's
a
*NL*
sixpence
for
a
fairing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
he
's
better
tempered
,
and
Henchard
's
a
fool
to
him
,
'
they
say
.
*NL*
And
when
some
of
the
women
were
a-walking
home
they
said
,
`
He
's
a
*NL*
diment
--
he
's
a
chap
o
'
wax
--
he
's
the
best
--
he
's
the
horse
for
my
money
,
'
*NL*
says
they
.
And
they
said
,
`
He
's
the
most
understanding
man
o
'
them
two
*NL*
by
long
chalks
.
I
wish
he
was
the
master
instead
of
Henchard
,
'
they
*NL*
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
talk
any
nonsense
,
''
Henchard
replied
with
covered
gloom
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
you
can
go
now
.
And
I
am
coming
to
value
the
hay
,
d'ye
hear
?
--
I.
''
The
*NL*
boy
departed
,
and
Henchard
murmured
,
``
Wish
he
were
master
here
,
do
*NL*
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
towards
Durnover
.
On
his
way
he
overtook
Farfrae
.
They
walked
on
*NL*
together
,
Henchard
looking
mostly
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
no
yoursel
'
the
day
?
''
Donald
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
very
well
,
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
ye
are
a
bit
down
--
surely
ye
are
down
?
Why
,
there
's
nothing
to
be
*NL*
angry
about
!
'T
is
splendid
stuff
that
we
've
got
from
Blackmoor
Vale
.
By
*NL*
the
by
,
the
people
in
Durnover
want
their
hay
valued
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
am
going
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
with
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Henchard
did
not
reply
Donald
practised
a
piece
of
music
sotto
voce
,
*NL*
till
,
getting
near
the
bereaved
people
's
door
,
he
stopped
himself
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
as
their
father
is
dead
I
wo
n't
go
on
with
such
as
that
.
How
could
*NL*
I
forget
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
care
so
very
much
about
hurting
folks
'
feelings
?
''
observed
*NL*
Henchard
with
a
half
sneer
.
``
You
do
,
I
know
--
especially
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
if
I
have
hurt
yours
,
sir
,
''
replied
Donald
,
standing
still
,
*NL*
with
a
second
expression
of
the
same
sentiment
in
the
regretfulness
of
*NL*
his
face
.
``
Why
should
you
say
it
--
think
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cloud
lifted
from
Henchard
's
brow
,
and
as
Donald
finished
the
*NL*
corn-merchant
turned
to
him
,
regarding
his
breast
rather
than
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
hearing
things
that
vexed
me
,
''
he
said
.
''
'T
was
that
made
me
*NL*
short
in
my
manner
--
made
me
overlook
what
you
really
are
.
Now
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
go
in
here
about
this
hay
--
Farfrae
,
you
can
do
it
better
than
I
.
*NL*
They
sent
for
`
ee
,
too
.
I
have
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
Town
Council
*NL*
at
eleven
,
and
't
is
drawing
on
for
`
t.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
thus
in
renewed
friendship
,
Donald
forbearing
to
ask
*NL*
Henchard
for
meanings
that
were
not
very
plain
to
him
.
On
Henchard
's
*NL*
part
there
was
now
again
repose
;
and
yet
,
whenever
he
thought
of
*NL*
Farfrae
,
it
was
with
a
dim
dread
;
and
he
often
regretted
that
he
had
*NL*
told
the
young
man
his
whole
heart
,
and
confided
to
him
the
secrets
of
*NL*
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
16
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
account
Henchard
's
manner
towards
Farfrae
insensibly
became
*NL*
more
reserved
.
He
was
courteous
--
too
courteous
--
and
Farfrae
was
quite
*NL*
surprised
at
the
good
breeding
which
now
for
the
first
time
*NL*
showed
itself
among
the
qualities
of
a
man
he
had
hitherto
thought
*NL*
undisciplined
,
if
warm
and
sincere
.
The
corn-factor
seldom
or
never
*NL*
again
put
his
arm
upon
the
young
man
's
shoulder
so
as
to
nearly
weigh
*NL*
him
down
with
the
pressure
of
mechanized
friendship
.
He
left
off
coming
*NL*
to
Donald
's
lodgings
and
shouting
into
the
passage
.
``
Hoy
,
Farfrae
,
*NL*
boy
,
come
and
have
some
dinner
with
us
!
Do
n't
sit
here
in
solitary
*NL*
confinement
!
''
But
in
the
daily
routine
of
their
business
there
was
*NL*
little
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
their
lives
rolled
on
till
a
day
of
public
rejoicing
was
suggested
*NL*
to
the
country
at
large
in
celebration
of
a
national
event
that
had
*NL*
recently
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
Casterbridge
,
by
nature
slow
,
made
no
response
.
Then
one
*NL*
day
Donald
Farfrae
broached
the
subject
to
Henchard
by
asking
if
he
*NL*
would
have
any
objection
to
lend
some
rick-cloths
to
himself
and
a
few
*NL*
others
,
who
contemplated
getting
up
an
entertainment
of
some
sort
on
*NL*
the
day
named
,
and
required
a
shelter
for
the
same
,
to
which
they
might
*NL*
charge
admission
at
the
rate
of
so
much
a
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
as
many
cloths
as
you
like
,
''
Henchard
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
manager
had
gone
about
the
business
Henchard
was
fired
with
*NL*
emulation
.
It
certainly
had
been
very
remiss
of
him
,
as
Mayor
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
to
call
no
meeting
ere
this
,
to
discuss
what
should
be
done
on
*NL*
this
holiday
.
But
Farfrae
had
been
so
cursed
quick
in
his
movements
as
*NL*
to
give
old-fashioned
people
in
authority
no
chance
of
the
initiative
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
not
too
late
;
and
on
second
thoughts
he
determined
*NL*
to
take
upon
his
own
shoulders
the
responsibility
of
organizing
some
*NL*
amusements
,
if
the
other
Councilmen
would
leave
the
matter
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
To
this
they
quite
readily
agreed
,
the
majority
being
fine
old
crusted
*NL*
characters
who
had
a
decided
taste
for
living
without
worry
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Henchard
set
about
his
preparations
for
a
really
brilliant
*NL*
thing
--
such
as
should
be
worthy
of
the
venerable
town
.
As
for
Farfrae
's
*NL*
little
affair
,
Henchard
nearly
forgot
it
;
except
once
now
and
then
when
,
*NL*
on
it
coming
into
his
mind
,
he
said
to
himself
,
``
Charge
admission
at
*NL*
so
much
a
head
--
just
like
a
Scotchman
!
--
who
is
going
to
pay
anything
*NL*
a
head
?
''
The
diversions
which
the
Mayor
intended
to
provide
were
to
be
*NL*
entirely
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
grown
so
dependent
upon
Donald
that
he
could
scarcely
resist
*NL*
calling
him
in
to
consult
.
But
by
sheer
self-coercion
he
refrained
.
No
,
*NL*
he
thought
,
Farfrae
would
be
suggesting
such
improvements
in
his
damned
*NL*
luminous
way
that
in
spite
of
himself
he
,
Henchard
,
would
sink
to
the
*NL*
position
of
second
fiddle
,
and
only
scrape
harmonies
to
his
manager
's
*NL*
talents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
applauded
the
Mayor
's
proposed
entertainment
,
especially
when
*NL*
it
became
known
that
he
meant
to
pay
for
it
all
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Close
to
the
town
was
an
elevated
green
spot
surrounded
by
an
ancient
*NL*
square
earthwork
--
earthworks
square
and
not
square
,
were
as
common
as
*NL*
blackberries
hereabout
--
a
spot
whereon
the
Casterbridge
people
usually
*NL*
held
any
kind
of
merry-making
,
meeting
,
or
sheep-fair
that
required
more
*NL*
space
than
the
streets
would
afford
.
On
one
side
it
sloped
to
the
river
*NL*
Froom
,
and
from
any
point
a
view
was
obtained
of
the
country
round
*NL*
for
many
miles
.
This
pleasant
upland
was
to
be
the
scene
of
Henchard
's
*NL*
exploit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advertised
about
the
town
,
in
long
posters
of
a
pink
colour
,
that
*NL*
games
of
all
sorts
would
take
place
here
;
and
set
to
work
a
little
*NL*
battalion
of
men
under
his
own
eye
.
They
erected
greasy-poles
for
*NL*
climbing
,
with
smoked
hams
and
local
cheeses
at
the
top
.
They
placed
*NL*
hurdles
in
rows
for
jumping
over
;
across
the
river
they
laid
a
slippery
*NL*
pole
,
with
a
live
pig
of
the
neighbourhood
tied
at
the
other
end
,
to
*NL*
become
the
property
of
the
man
who
could
walk
over
and
get
it
.
There
*NL*
were
also
provided
wheelbarrows
for
racing
,
donkeys
for
the
same
,
a
*NL*
stage
for
boxing
,
wrestling
,
and
drawing
blood
generally
;
sacks
for
*NL*
jumping
in
.
Moreover
,
not
forgetting
his
principles
,
Henchard
provided
a
*NL*
mammoth
tea
,
of
which
everybody
who
lived
in
the
borough
was
invited
to
*NL*
partake
without
payment
.
The
tables
were
laid
parallel
with
the
inner
*NL*
slope
of
the
rampart
,
and
awnings
were
stretched
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
to
and
fro
the
Mayor
beheld
the
unattractive
exterior
of
*NL*
Farfrae
's
erection
in
the
West
Walk
,
rick-cloths
of
different
sizes
*NL*
and
colours
being
hung
up
to
the
arching
trees
without
any
regard
to
*NL*
appearance
.
He
was
easy
in
his
mind
now
,
for
his
own
preparations
far
*NL*
transcended
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
came
.
The
sky
,
which
had
been
remarkably
clear
down
to
*NL*
within
a
day
or
two
,
was
overcast
,
and
the
weather
threatening
,
the
wind
*NL*
having
an
unmistakable
hint
of
water
in
it
.
Henchard
wished
he
had
not
*NL*
been
quite
so
sure
about
the
continuance
of
a
fair
season
.
But
it
was
*NL*
too
late
to
modify
or
postpone
,
and
the
proceedings
went
on
.
At
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
the
rain
began
to
fall
,
small
and
steady
,
commencing
and
*NL*
increasing
so
insensibly
that
it
was
difficult
to
state
exactly
when
dry
*NL*
weather
ended
or
wet
established
itself
.
In
an
hour
the
slight
moisture
*NL*
resolved
itself
into
a
monotonous
smiting
of
earth
by
heaven
,
in
*NL*
torrents
to
which
no
end
could
be
prognosticated
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
number
of
people
had
heroically
gathered
in
the
field
but
by
three
*NL*
o'clock
Henchard
discerned
that
his
project
was
doomed
to
end
in
*NL*
failure
.
The
hams
at
the
top
of
the
poles
dripped
watered
smoke
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
brown
liquor
,
the
pig
shivered
in
the
wind
,
the
grain
of
the
*NL*
deal
tables
showed
through
the
sticking
tablecloths
,
for
the
awning
*NL*
allowed
the
rain
to
drift
under
at
its
will
,
and
to
enclose
the
sides
*NL*
at
this
hour
seemed
a
useless
undertaking
.
The
landscape
over
the
*NL*
river
disappeared
;
the
wind
played
on
the
tent-cords
in
aeolian
*NL*
improvisations
,
and
at
length
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
whole
*NL*
erection
slanted
to
the
ground
those
who
had
taken
shelter
within
it
*NL*
having
to
crawl
out
on
their
hands
and
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
towards
six
the
storm
abated
,
and
a
drier
breeze
shook
the
moisture
*NL*
from
the
grass
bents
.
It
seemed
possible
to
carry
out
the
programme
*NL*
after
all
.
The
awning
was
set
up
again
;
the
band
was
called
out
from
its
*NL*
shelter
,
and
ordered
to
begin
,
and
where
the
tables
had
stood
a
place
*NL*
was
cleared
for
dancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
the
folk
?
''
said
Henchard
,
after
the
lapse
of
*NL*
half-an-hour
,
during
which
time
only
two
men
and
a
woman
had
stood
up
to
*NL*
dance
.
``
The
shops
are
all
shut
.
Why
do
n't
they
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
at
Farfrae
's
affair
in
the
West
Walk
,
''
answered
a
Councilman
*NL*
who
stood
in
the
field
with
the
Mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
,
I
suppose
.
But
where
are
the
body
o
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
out
of
doors
are
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
more
fools
they
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
walked
away
moodily
.
One
or
two
young
fellows
gallantly
came
to
*NL*
climb
the
poles
,
to
save
the
hams
from
being
wasted
;
but
as
there
*NL*
were
no
spectators
,
and
the
whole
scene
presented
the
most
melancholy
*NL*
appearance
Henchard
gave
orders
that
the
proceedings
were
to
be
*NL*
suspended
,
and
the
entertainment
closed
,
the
food
to
be
distributed
*NL*
among
the
poor
people
of
the
town
.
In
a
short
time
nothing
was
left
in
*NL*
the
field
but
a
few
hurdles
,
the
tents
,
and
the
poles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
returned
to
his
house
,
had
tea
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
*NL*
then
walked
out
.
It
was
now
dusk
.
He
soon
saw
that
the
tendency
of
all
*NL*
promenaders
was
towards
a
particular
spot
in
the
Walks
,
and
eventually
*NL*
proceeded
thither
himself
.
The
notes
of
a
stringed
band
came
from
the
*NL*
enclosure
that
Farfrae
had
erected
--
the
pavilion
as
he
called
it
--
and
*NL*
when
the
Mayor
reached
it
he
perceived
that
a
gigantic
tent
had
been
*NL*
ingeniously
constructed
without
poles
or
ropes
.
The
densest
point
of
the
*NL*
avenue
of
sycamores
had
been
selected
,
where
the
boughs
made
a
closely
*NL*
interlaced
vault
overhead
;
to
these
boughs
the
canvas
had
been
hung
,
and
*NL*
a
barrel
roof
was
the
result
.
The
end
towards
the
wind
was
enclosed
,
the
*NL*
other
end
was
open
.
Henchard
went
round
and
saw
the
interior
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
form
it
was
like
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
with
one
gable
removed
,
but
*NL*
the
scene
within
was
anything
but
devotional
.
A
reel
or
fling
of
some
*NL*
sort
was
in
progress
;
and
the
usually
sedate
Farfrae
was
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
other
dancers
in
the
costume
of
a
wild
Highlander
,
flinging
himself
*NL*
about
and
spinning
to
the
tune
.
For
a
moment
Henchard
could
not
help
*NL*
laughing
.
Then
he
perceived
the
immense
admiration
for
the
Scotchman
*NL*
that
revealed
itself
in
the
women
's
faces
;
and
when
this
exhibition
was
*NL*
over
,
and
a
new
dance
proposed
,
and
Donald
had
disappeared
for
a
time
to
*NL*
return
in
his
natural
garments
,
he
had
an
unlimited
choice
of
partners
,
*NL*
every
girl
being
in
a
coming-on
disposition
towards
one
who
so
*NL*
thoroughly
understood
the
poetry
of
motion
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
town
crowded
to
the
Walk
,
such
a
delightful
idea
of
a
ballroom
*NL*
never
having
occurred
to
the
inhabitants
before
.
Among
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
onlookers
were
Elizabeth
and
her
mother
--
the
former
thoughtful
yet
*NL*
much
interested
,
her
eyes
beaming
with
a
longing
lingering
light
,
as
*NL*
if
Nature
had
been
advised
by
Correggio
in
their
creation
.
The
dancing
*NL*
progressed
with
unabated
spirit
,
and
Henchard
walked
and
waited
till
*NL*
his
wife
should
be
disposed
to
go
home
.
He
did
not
care
to
keep
in
the
*NL*
light
,
and
when
he
went
into
the
dark
it
was
worse
,
for
there
he
heard
*NL*
remarks
of
a
kind
which
were
becoming
too
frequent
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Henchard
's
rejoicings
could
n't
say
good
morning
to
this
,
''
said
one
.
*NL*
``
A
man
must
be
a
headstrong
stunpoll
to
think
folk
would
go
up
to
that
*NL*
bleak
place
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
answered
that
people
said
it
was
not
only
in
such
things
as
*NL*
those
that
the
Mayor
was
wanting
.
``
Where
would
his
business
be
if
*NL*
it
were
not
for
this
young
fellow
?
'T
was
verily
Fortune
sent
him
to
*NL*
Henchard
.
His
accounts
were
like
a
bramblewood
when
Mr.
Farfrae
came
.
*NL*
He
used
to
reckon
his
sacks
by
chalk
strokes
all
in
a
row
like
*NL*
garden-palings
,
measure
his
ricks
by
stretching
with
his
arms
,
weigh
his
*NL*
trusses
by
a
lift
,
judge
his
hay
by
a
chaw
,
and
settle
the
price
with
a
*NL*
curse
.
But
now
this
accomplished
young
man
does
it
all
by
ciphering
and
*NL*
mensuration
.
Then
the
wheat
--
that
sometimes
used
to
taste
so
strong
*NL*
o
'
mice
when
made
into
bread
that
people
could
fairly
tell
the
*NL*
breed
--
Farfrae
has
a
plan
for
purifying
,
so
that
nobody
would
dream
the
*NL*
smallest
four-legged
beast
had
walked
over
it
once
.
O
yes
,
everybody
*NL*
is
full
of
him
,
and
the
care
Mr.
Henchard
has
to
keep
him
,
to
be
sure
!
''
*NL*
concluded
this
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
wo
n't
do
it
for
long
,
good-now
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Henchard
to
himself
behind
the
tree
.
``
Or
if
he
do
,
he
'll
be
*NL*
honeycombed
clean
out
of
all
the
character
and
standing
that
he
's
built
*NL*
up
in
these
eighteen
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
dancing
pavilion
.
Farfrae
was
footing
a
quaint
*NL*
little
dance
with
Elizabeth-Jane
--
an
old
country
thing
,
the
only
one
she
*NL*
knew
,
and
though
he
considerately
toned
down
his
movements
to
suit
her
*NL*
demurer
gait
,
the
pattern
of
the
shining
little
nails
in
the
soles
of
*NL*
his
boots
became
familiar
to
the
eyes
of
every
bystander
.
The
tune
*NL*
had
enticed
her
into
it
;
being
a
tune
of
a
busy
,
vaulting
,
leaping
*NL*
sort
--
some
low
notes
on
the
silver
string
of
each
fiddle
,
then
a
*NL*
skipping
on
the
small
,
like
running
up
and
down
ladders
--
``
Miss
M'Leod
of
*NL*
Ayr
''
was
its
name
,
so
Mr.
Farfrae
had
said
,
and
that
it
was
very
popular
*NL*
in
his
own
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
soon
over
,
and
the
girl
looked
at
Henchard
for
approval
;
but
*NL*
he
did
not
give
it
.
He
seemed
not
to
see
her
.
``
Look
here
,
Farfrae
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
like
one
whose
mind
was
elsewhere
,
``
I
'll
go
to
Port-Bredy
Great
*NL*
Market
to-morrow
myself
.
You
can
stay
and
put
things
right
in
your
*NL*
clothes-box
,
and
recover
strength
to
your
knees
after
your
vagaries
.
''
He
*NL*
planted
on
Donald
an
antagonistic
glare
that
had
begun
as
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
other
townsmen
came
up
,
and
Donald
drew
aside
.
``
What
's
this
,
*NL*
Henchard
,
''
said
Alderman
Tubber
,
applying
his
thumb
to
the
corn-factor
*NL*
like
a
cheese-taster
.
``
An
opposition
randy
to
yours
,
eh
?
Jack
's
as
good
*NL*
as
his
master
,
eh
?
Cut
ye
out
quite
,
has
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Mr.
Henchard
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
another
goodnatured
friend
,
*NL*
``
where
you
made
the
mistake
was
in
going
so
far
afield
.
You
should
have
*NL*
taken
a
leaf
out
of
his
book
,
and
have
had
your
sports
in
a
sheltered
*NL*
place
like
this
.
But
you
did
n't
think
of
it
,
you
see
;
and
he
did
,
and
*NL*
that
's
where
he
's
beat
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
be
top-sawyer
soon
of
you
two
,
and
carry
all
afore
him
,
''
added
*NL*
jocular
Mr.
Tubber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Henchard
gloomily
.
``
He
wo
n't
be
that
,
because
he
's
shortly
*NL*
going
to
leave
me
.
''
He
looked
towards
Donald
,
who
had
come
near
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Farfrae
's
time
as
my
manager
is
drawing
to
a
close
--
is
n't
it
,
Farfrae
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
who
could
now
read
the
lines
and
folds
of
Henchard
's
*NL*
strongly-traced
face
as
if
they
were
clear
verbal
inscriptions
,
quietly
*NL*
assented
;
and
when
people
deplored
the
fact
,
and
asked
why
it
was
,
he
*NL*
simply
replied
that
Mr.
Henchard
no
longer
required
his
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
went
home
,
apparently
satisfied
.
But
in
the
morning
,
when
his
*NL*
jealous
temper
had
passed
away
,
his
heart
sank
within
him
at
what
he
had
*NL*
said
and
done
.
He
was
the
more
disturbed
when
he
found
that
this
time
*NL*
Farfrae
was
determined
to
take
him
at
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
17
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
perceived
from
Henchard
's
manner
that
in
assenting
to
*NL*
dance
she
had
made
a
mistake
of
some
kind
.
In
her
simplicity
she
did
*NL*
not
know
what
it
was
till
a
hint
from
a
nodding
acquaintance
enlightened
*NL*
her
.
As
the
Mayor
's
step-daughter
,
she
learnt
,
she
had
not
been
quite
in
*NL*
her
place
in
treading
a
measure
amid
such
a
mixed
throng
as
filled
the
*NL*
dancing
pavilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
her
ears
,
cheeks
,
and
chin
glowed
like
live
coals
at
the
*NL*
dawning
of
the
idea
that
her
tastes
were
not
good
enough
for
her
*NL*
position
,
and
would
bring
her
into
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
her
very
miserable
,
and
she
looked
about
for
her
mother
;
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Henchard
,
who
had
less
idea
of
conventionality
than
Elizabeth
*NL*
herself
,
had
gone
away
,
leaving
her
daughter
to
return
at
her
own
*NL*
pleasure
.
The
latter
moved
on
into
the
dark
dense
old
avenues
,
or
rather
*NL*
vaults
of
living
woodwork
,
which
ran
along
the
town
boundary
,
and
stood
*NL*
reflecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
followed
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
her
face
being
to-wards
the
shine
*NL*
from
the
tent
he
recognized
her
.
It
was
Farfrae
--
just
come
from
the
*NL*
dialogue
with
Henchard
which
had
signified
his
dismissal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
you
,
Miss
Newson
?
--
and
I
've
been
looking
for
ye
everywhere
!
''
*NL*
he
said
,
overcoming
a
sadness
imparted
by
the
estrangement
with
the
*NL*
corn-merchant
.
``
May
I
walk
on
with
you
as
far
as
your
street-corner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
there
might
be
something
wrong
in
this
,
but
did
not
utter
*NL*
any
objection
.
So
together
they
went
on
,
first
down
the
West
Walk
,
and
*NL*
then
into
the
Bowling
Walk
,
till
Farfrae
said
,
``
It
's
like
that
I
'm
going
*NL*
to
leave
you
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
faltered
,
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
as
a
mere
matter
of
business
--
nothing
more
.
But
we
'll
not
concern
*NL*
ourselves
about
it
--
it
is
for
the
best
.
I
hoped
to
have
another
dance
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
she
could
not
dance
--
in
any
proper
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
but
you
do
!
It
's
the
feeling
for
it
rather
than
the
learning
of
*NL*
steps
that
makes
pleasant
dancers
...
I
fear
I
offended
your
father
by
*NL*
getting
up
this
!
And
now
,
perhaps
,
I
'll
have
to
go
to
another
part
o
'
*NL*
the
warrld
altogether
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
such
a
melancholy
prospect
that
Elizabeth-Jane
breathed
*NL*
a
sigh
--
letting
it
off
in
fragments
that
he
might
not
hear
her
.
*NL*
But
darkness
makes
people
truthful
,
and
the
Scotchman
went
on
*NL*
impulsively
--
perhaps
he
had
heard
her
after
all
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
was
richer
,
Miss
Newson
;
and
your
stepfather
had
not
been
*NL*
offended
,
I
would
ask
you
something
in
a
short
time
--
yes
,
I
would
ask
*NL*
you
to-night
.
But
that
's
not
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
would
have
asked
her
he
did
not
say
,
and
instead
of
encouraging
*NL*
him
she
remained
incompetently
silent
.
Thus
afraid
one
of
another
they
*NL*
continued
their
promenade
along
the
walls
till
they
got
near
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
Bowling
Walk
;
twenty
steps
further
and
the
trees
would
end
,
*NL*
and
the
street-corner
and
lamps
appear
.
In
consciousness
of
this
they
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
found
out
who
it
was
that
sent
us
to
Durnover
granary
on
a
*NL*
fool
's
errand
that
day
,
''
said
Donald
,
in
his
undulating
tones
.
``
Did
ye
*NL*
ever
know
yourself
,
Miss
Newson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
they
did
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
fun
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
not
for
fun
.
It
might
have
been
that
they
thought
they
*NL*
would
like
us
to
stay
waiting
there
,
talking
to
one
another
?
Ay
,
well
!
I
*NL*
hope
you
Casterbridge
folk
will
not
forget
me
if
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
'm
sure
we
wo
n't
!
''
she
said
earnestly
.
``
I
--
wish
you
would
n't
go
*NL*
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
got
into
the
lamplight
.
``
Now
,
I
'll
think
over
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Donald
Farfrae
.
``
And
I
'll
not
come
up
to
your
door
;
but
part
from
you
*NL*
here
;
lest
it
make
your
father
more
angry
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
,
Farfrae
returning
into
the
dark
Bowling
Walk
,
and
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
going
up
the
street
.
Without
any
consciousness
of
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
she
started
running
with
all
her
might
till
she
reached
*NL*
her
father
's
door
.
``
O
dear
me
--
what
am
I
at
?
''
she
thought
,
as
she
pulled
*NL*
up
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indoors
she
fell
to
conjecturing
the
meaning
of
Farfrae
's
enigmatic
*NL*
words
about
not
daring
to
ask
her
what
he
fain
would
.
Elizabeth
,
that
*NL*
silent
observing
woman
,
had
long
noted
how
he
was
rising
in
favour
among
*NL*
the
townspeople
;
and
knowing
Henchard
's
nature
now
she
had
feared
that
*NL*
Farfrae
's
days
as
manager
were
numbered
,
so
that
the
announcement
gave
*NL*
her
little
surprise
.
Would
Mr.
Farfrae
stay
in
Casterbridge
despite
his
*NL*
words
and
her
father
's
dismissal
?
His
occult
breathings
to
her
might
be
*NL*
solvable
by
his
course
in
that
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
windy
--
so
windy
that
walking
in
the
garden
she
picked
*NL*
up
a
portion
of
the
draft
of
a
letter
on
business
in
Donald
Farfrae
's
*NL*
writing
,
which
had
flown
over
the
wall
from
the
office
.
The
useless
*NL*
scrap
she
took
indoors
,
and
began
to
copy
the
calligraphy
,
which
she
*NL*
much
admired
.
The
letter
began
``
Dear
Sir
,
''
and
presently
writing
on
a
*NL*
loose
slip
``
Elizabeth-Jane
,
''
she
laid
the
latter
over
``
Sir
,
''
making
the
*NL*
phrase
``
Dear
Elizabeth-Jane
.
''
When
she
saw
the
effect
a
quick
red
ran
up
*NL*
her
face
and
warmed
her
through
,
though
nobody
was
there
to
see
what
she
*NL*
had
done
.
She
quickly
tore
up
the
slip
,
and
threw
it
away
.
After
this
*NL*
she
grew
cool
and
laughed
at
herself
,
walked
about
the
room
,
and
laughed
*NL*
again
;
not
joyfully
,
but
distressfully
rather
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quickly
known
in
Casterbridge
that
Farfrae
and
Henchard
had
*NL*
decided
to
dispense
with
each
other
.
Elizabeth-Jane
's
anxiety
to
know
*NL*
if
Farfrae
were
going
away
from
the
town
reached
a
pitch
that
disturbed
*NL*
her
,
for
she
could
no
longer
conceal
from
herself
the
cause
.
At
length
*NL*
the
news
reached
her
that
he
was
not
going
to
leave
the
place
.
A
man
*NL*
following
the
same
trade
as
Henchard
,
but
on
a
very
small
scale
,
had
*NL*
sold
his
business
to
Farfrae
,
who
was
forthwith
about
to
start
as
corn
*NL*
and
hay
merchant
on
his
own
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
heart
fluttered
when
she
heard
of
this
step
of
Donald
's
,
proving
*NL*
that
he
meant
to
remain
;
and
yet
,
would
a
man
who
cared
one
little
bit
*NL*
for
her
have
endangered
his
suit
by
setting
up
a
business
in
opposition
*NL*
to
Mr.
Henchard
's
?
Surely
not
;
and
it
must
have
been
a
passing
impulse
*NL*
only
which
had
led
him
to
address
her
so
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
solve
the
problem
whether
her
appearance
on
the
evening
of
the
dance
*NL*
were
such
as
to
inspire
a
fleeting
love
at
first
sight
,
she
dressed
*NL*
herself
up
exactly
as
she
had
dressed
then
--
the
muslin
,
the
spencer
,
the
*NL*
sandals
,
the
para-sol
--
and
looked
in
the
mirror
The
picture
glassed
back
*NL*
was
in
her
opinion
,
precisely
of
such
a
kind
as
to
inspire
that
fleeting
*NL*
regard
,
and
no
more
--
``
just
enough
to
make
him
silly
,
and
not
enough
*NL*
to
keep
him
so
,
''
she
said
luminously
;
and
Elizabeth
thought
,
in
a
much
*NL*
lower
key
,
that
by
this
time
he
had
discovered
how
plain
and
homely
was
*NL*
the
informing
spirit
of
that
pretty
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
when
she
felt
her
heart
going
out
to
him
,
she
would
say
to
*NL*
herself
with
a
mock
pleasantry
that
carried
an
ache
with
it
,
``
No
,
no
,
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
--
such
dreams
are
not
for
you
!
''
She
tried
to
prevent
*NL*
herself
from
seeing
him
,
and
thinking
of
him
;
succeeding
fairly
well
in
*NL*
the
former
attempt
,
in
the
latter
not
so
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
,
who
had
been
hurt
at
finding
that
Farfrae
did
not
mean
to
*NL*
put
up
with
his
temper
any
longer
,
was
incensed
beyond
measure
when
*NL*
he
learnt
what
the
young
man
had
done
as
an
alternative
.
It
was
in
*NL*
the
town-hall
,
after
a
council
meeting
,
that
he
first
became
aware
of
*NL*
Farfrae
's
coup
for
establishing
himself
independently
in
the
town
;
and
*NL*
his
voice
might
have
been
heard
as
far
as
the
town-pump
expressing
his
*NL*
feelings
to
his
fellow
councilmen
.
These
tones
showed
that
,
though
under
*NL*
a
long
reign
of
self-control
he
had
become
Mayor
and
churchwarden
and
*NL*
what
not
,
there
was
still
the
same
unruly
volcanic
stuff
beneath
the
*NL*
rind
of
Michael
Henchard
as
when
he
had
sold
his
wife
at
Weydon
Fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
's
a
friend
of
mine
,
and
I
'm
a
friend
of
his
--
or
if
we
are
not
,
*NL*
what
are
we
?
`
Od
send
,
if
I
've
not
been
his
friend
,
who
has
,
I
should
*NL*
like
to
know
?
Did
n't
he
come
here
without
a
sound
shoe
to
his
voot
?
*NL*
Did
n't
I
keep
him
here
--
help
him
to
a
living
?
Did
n't
I
help
him
to
*NL*
money
,
or
whatever
he
wanted
?
I
stuck
out
for
no
terms
--
I
said
`
Name
*NL*
your
own
price
.
'
I
'd
have
shared
my
last
crust
with
that
young
fellow
*NL*
at
one
time
,
I
liked
him
so
well
.
And
now
he
's
defied
me
!
But
damn
him
,
*NL*
I
'll
have
a
tussle
with
him
now
--
at
fair
buying
and
selling
,
mind
--
at
*NL*
fair
buying
and
selling
!
And
if
I
ca
n't
overbid
such
a
stripling
as
he
,
*NL*
then
I
'm
not
wo
`
th
a
varden
!
We
'll
show
that
we
know
our
business
as
*NL*
well
as
one
here
and
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friends
of
the
Corporation
did
not
specially
respond
.
Henchard
was
*NL*
less
popular
now
than
he
had
been
when
nearly
two
years
before
,
they
*NL*
had
voted
him
to
the
chief
magistracy
on
account
of
his
amazing
*NL*
energy
.
While
they
had
collectively
profited
by
this
quality
of
the
*NL*
corn-factor
's
they
had
been
made
to
wince
individually
on
more
than
one
*NL*
occasion
.
So
he
went
out
of
the
hall
and
down
the
street
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
home
he
seemed
to
recollect
something
with
a
sour
satisfaction
.
*NL*
He
called
Elizabeth-Jane
.
Seeing
how
he
looked
when
she
entered
she
*NL*
appeared
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
to
find
fault
with
,
''
he
said
,
observing
her
concern
.
``
Only
I
*NL*
want
to
caution
you
,
my
dear
.
That
man
,
Farfrae
--
it
is
about
him
.
I
've
*NL*
seen
him
talking
to
you
two
or
three
times
--
he
danced
with
`
ee
at
the
*NL*
rejoicings
,
and
came
home
with
`
ee
.
Now
,
now
,
no
blame
to
you
.
But
just
*NL*
harken
:
Have
you
made
him
any
foolish
promise
?
Gone
the
least
bit
beyond
*NL*
sniff
and
snaff
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
have
promised
him
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
All
's
well
that
ends
well
.
I
particularly
wish
you
not
to
see
him
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
much
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
He
's
an
enemy
to
our
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
gone
he
sat
down
,
and
wrote
in
a
heavy
hand
to
Farfrae
*NL*
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SIR
,
--
I
make
request
that
henceforth
you
and
my
stepdaughter
be
as
*NL*
strangers
to
each
other
.
She
on
her
part
has
promised
to
welcome
no
*NL*
more
addresses
from
you
;
and
I
trust
,
therefore
,
you
will
not
attempt
to
*NL*
force
them
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
HENCHARD
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
almost
have
supposed
Henchard
to
have
had
policy
to
see
*NL*
that
no
better
modus
vivendi
could
be
arrived
at
with
Farfrae
than
by
*NL*
encouraging
him
to
become
his
son-in-law
.
But
such
a
scheme
for
buying
*NL*
over
a
rival
had
nothing
to
recommend
it
to
the
Mayor
's
headstrong
*NL*
faculties
.
With
all
domestic
finesse
of
that
kind
he
was
hopelessly
at
*NL*
variance
.
Loving
a
man
or
hating
him
,
his
diplomacy
was
as
wrongheaded
*NL*
as
a
buffalo
's
;
and
his
wife
had
not
ventured
to
suggest
the
course
*NL*
which
she
,
for
many
reasons
,
would
have
welcomed
gladly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Donald
Farfrae
had
opened
the
gates
of
commerce
on
his
own
*NL*
account
at
a
spot
on
Durnover
Hill
--
as
far
as
possible
from
Henchard
's
*NL*
stores
,
and
with
every
intention
of
keeping
clear
of
his
former
friend
*NL*
and
employer
's
customers
.
There
was
,
it
seemed
to
the
younger
man
,
room
*NL*
for
both
of
them
and
to
spare
.
The
town
was
small
,
but
the
corn
and
*NL*
hay-trade
was
proportionately
large
,
and
with
his
native
sagacity
he
saw
*NL*
opportunity
for
a
share
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
determined
was
he
to
do
nothing
which
should
seem
like
*NL*
trade-antagonism
to
the
Mayor
that
he
refused
his
first
customer
--
a
*NL*
large
farmer
of
good
repute
--
because
Henchard
and
this
man
had
dealt
*NL*
together
within
the
preceding
three
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
once
my
friend
,
''
said
Farfrae
,
``
and
it
's
not
for
me
to
take
*NL*
business
from
him
.
I
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
,
but
I
can
not
hurt
the
*NL*
trade
of
a
man
who
's
been
so
kind
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
this
praiseworthy
course
the
Scotchman
's
trade
increased
.
*NL*
Whether
it
were
that
his
northern
energy
was
an
overmastering
force
*NL*
among
the
easy-going
Wessex
worthies
,
or
whether
it
was
sheer
luck
,
the
*NL*
fact
remained
that
whatever
he
touched
he
prospered
in
.
Like
Jacob
*NL*
in
Padan-Aram
,
he
would
no
sooner
humbly
limit
himself
to
*NL*
the
ringstraked-and-spotted
exceptions
of
trade
than
the
*NL*
ringstraked-and-spotted
would
multiply
and
prevail
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
most
probably
luck
had
little
to
do
with
it
.
Character
is
Fate
,
said
*NL*
Novalis
,
and
Farfrae
's
character
was
just
the
reverse
of
Henchard
's
,
*NL*
who
might
not
inaptly
be
described
as
Faust
has
been
described
--
as
a
*NL*
vehement
gloomy
being
who
had
quitted
the
ways
of
vulgar
men
without
*NL*
light
to
guide
him
on
a
better
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
duly
received
the
request
to
discontinue
attentions
to
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
.
His
acts
of
that
kind
had
been
so
slight
that
the
*NL*
request
was
almost
superfluous
.
Yet
he
had
felt
a
considerable
interest
*NL*
in
her
,
and
after
some
cogitation
he
decided
that
it
would
be
as
well
*NL*
to
enact
no
Romeo
part
just
then
--
for
the
young
girl
's
sake
no
less
than
*NL*
his
own
.
Thus
the
incipient
attachment
was
stifled
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
time
came
when
,
avoid
collision
with
his
former
friend
as
he
might
,
*NL*
Farfrae
was
compelled
,
in
sheer
self-defence
,
to
close
with
Henchard
in
*NL*
mortal
commercial
combat
.
He
could
no
longer
parry
the
fierce
attacks
*NL*
of
the
latter
by
simple
avoidance
.
As
soon
as
their
war
of
prices
began
*NL*
everybody
was
interested
,
and
some
few
guessed
the
end
.
It
was
,
in
some
*NL*
degree
,
Northern
insight
matched
against
Southern
doggedness
--
the
dirk
*NL*
against
the
cudgel
--
and
Henchard
's
weapon
was
one
which
,
if
it
did
not
*NL*
deal
ruin
at
the
first
or
second
stroke
,
left
him
afterwards
well-nigh
*NL*
at
his
antagonist
's
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
every
Saturday
they
encountered
each
other
amid
the
crowd
of
*NL*
farmers
which
thronged
about
the
market-place
in
the
weekly
course
of
*NL*
their
business
.
Donald
was
always
ready
,
and
even
anxious
,
to
say
a
few
*NL*
friendly
words
,
but
the
Mayor
invariably
gazed
stormfully
past
him
,
*NL*
like
one
who
had
endured
and
lost
on
his
account
,
and
could
in
no
sense
*NL*
forgive
the
wrong
;
nor
did
Farfrae
's
snubbed
manner
of
perplexity
at
all
*NL*
appease
him
.
The
large
farmers
,
corn-merchants
,
millers
,
auctioneers
,
*NL*
and
others
had
each
an
official
stall
in
the
corn-market
room
,
with
*NL*
their
names
painted
thereon
;
and
when
to
the
familiar
series
of
*NL*
``
Henchard
,
''
``
Everdene
,
''
``
Shiner
,
''
``
Darton
,
''
and
so
on
,
was
added
one
*NL*
inscribed
``
Farfrae
,
''
in
staring
new
letters
,
Henchard
was
stung
into
*NL*
bitterness
;
like
Bellerophon
,
he
wandered
away
from
the
crowd
,
cankered
*NL*
in
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
Donald
Farfrae
's
name
was
seldom
mentioned
in
Henchard
's
*NL*
house
.
If
at
breakfast
or
dinner
Elizabeth-Jane
's
mother
inadvertently
*NL*
alluded
to
her
favourite
's
movements
,
the
girl
would
implore
her
by
a
*NL*
look
to
be
silent
;
and
her
husband
would
say
,
``
What
--
are
you
,
too
,
my
*NL*
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
18
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
shock
which
had
been
foreseen
for
some
time
by
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
as
the
box
passenger
foresees
the
approaching
jerk
from
some
channel
*NL*
across
the
highway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
was
ill
--
too
unwell
to
leave
her
room
.
Henchard
,
who
treated
*NL*
her
kindly
,
except
in
moments
of
irritation
,
sent
at
once
for
the
*NL*
richest
,
busiest
doctor
,
whom
he
supposed
to
be
the
best
.
Bedtime
came
,
*NL*
and
they
burnt
a
light
all
night
.
In
a
day
or
two
she
rallied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
who
had
been
staying
up
,
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
on
the
*NL*
second
morning
,
and
Henchard
sat
down
alone
.
He
was
startled
to
see
*NL*
a
letter
for
him
from
Jersey
in
a
writing
he
knew
too
well
,
and
had
*NL*
expected
least
to
behold
again
.
He
took
it
up
in
his
hands
and
looked
*NL*
at
it
as
at
a
picture
,
a
vision
,
a
vista
of
past
enactments
;
and
then
he
*NL*
read
it
as
an
unimportant
finale
to
conjecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
writer
said
that
she
at
length
perceived
how
impossible
it
would
*NL*
be
for
any
further
communications
to
proceed
between
them
now
that
*NL*
his
re-marriage
had
taken
place
.
That
such
reunion
had
been
the
only
*NL*
straightforward
course
open
to
him
she
was
bound
to
admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
calm
reflection
,
therefore
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
I
quite
forgive
you
for
*NL*
landing
me
in
such
a
dilemma
,
remembering
that
you
concealed
nothing
*NL*
before
our
ill-advised
acquaintance
;
and
that
you
really
did
set
before
*NL*
me
in
your
grim
way
the
fact
of
there
being
a
certain
risk
in
intimacy
*NL*
with
you
,
slight
as
it
seemed
to
be
after
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
*NL*
silence
on
your
wife
's
part
.
I
thus
look
upon
the
whole
as
a
misfortune
*NL*
of
mine
,
and
not
a
fault
of
yours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
,
Michael
,
I
must
ask
you
to
overlook
those
letters
with
which
I
*NL*
pestered
you
day
after
day
in
the
heat
of
my
feelings
.
They
were
*NL*
written
whilst
I
thought
your
conduct
to
me
cruel
;
but
now
I
know
more
*NL*
particulars
of
the
position
you
were
in
I
see
how
inconsiderate
my
*NL*
reproaches
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
will
,
I
am
sure
,
perceive
that
the
one
condition
which
will
*NL*
make
any
future
happiness
possible
for
me
is
that
the
past
connection
*NL*
between
our
lives
be
kept
secret
outside
this
isle
.
Speak
of
it
I
know
*NL*
you
will
not
;
and
I
can
trust
you
not
to
write
of
it
.
One
safe-guard
*NL*
more
remains
to
be
mentioned
--
that
no
writings
of
mine
,
or
trifling
*NL*
articles
belonging
to
me
,
should
be
left
in
your
possession
through
*NL*
neglect
or
forgetfulness
.
To
this
end
may
I
request
you
to
return
to
*NL*
me
any
such
you
may
have
,
particularly
the
letters
written
in
the
first
*NL*
abandonment
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
handsome
sum
you
forwarded
to
me
as
a
plaster
to
the
wound
I
*NL*
heartily
thank
you

*NL*
``
I
am
now
on
my
way
to
Bristol
,
to
see
my
only
relative
.
She
is
rich
,
*NL*
and
I
hope
will
do
something
for
me
.
I
shall
return
through
Casterbridge
*NL*
and
Budmouth
,
where
I
shall
take
the
packet-boat
.
Can
you
meet
me
with
*NL*
the
letters
and
other
trifles
?
I
shall
be
in
the
coach
which
changes
*NL*
horses
at
the
Antelope
Hotel
at
half-past
five
Wednesday
evening
;
I
*NL*
shall
be
wearing
a
Paisley
shawl
with
a
red
centre
,
and
thus
may
easily
*NL*
be
found
.
I
should
prefer
this
plan
of
receiving
them
to
having
them
*NL*
sent
.
--
I
remain
still
,
yours
;
ever

``
LUCETTA

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
breathed
heavily
.
``
Poor
thing
--
better
you
had
not
known
me
!
*NL*
Upon
my
heart
and
soul
,
if
ever
I
should
be
left
in
a
position
to
*NL*
carry
out
that
marriage
with
thee
,
I
OUGHT
to
do
it
--
I
ought
to
do
it
,
*NL*
indeed
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
contingency
that
he
had
in
his
mind
was
,
of
course
,
the
death
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
requested
,
he
sealed
up
Lucetta
's
letters
,
and
put
the
parcel
aside
*NL*
till
the
day
she
had
appointed
;
this
plan
of
returning
them
by
hand
*NL*
being
apparently
a
little
ruse
of
the
young
lady
for
exchanging
a
word
*NL*
or
two
with
him
on
past
times
.
He
would
have
preferred
not
to
see
her
;
*NL*
but
deeming
that
there
could
be
no
great
harm
in
acquiescing
thus
far
,
*NL*
he
went
at
dusk
and
stood
opposite
the
coach-office
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
chilly
,
and
the
coach
was
late
.
Henchard
crossed
over
to
*NL*
it
while
the
horses
were
being
changed
;
but
there
was
no
Lucetta
*NL*
inside
or
out
.
Concluding
that
something
had
happened
to
modify
her
*NL*
arrangements
he
gave
the
matter
up
and
went
home
,
not
without
a
sense
of
*NL*
relief
.
Meanwhile
Mrs.
Henchard
was
weakening
visibly
.
She
could
not
*NL*
go
out
of
doors
any
more
.
One
day
,
after
much
thinking
which
seemed
to
*NL*
distress
her
,
she
said
she
wanted
to
write
something
.
A
desk
was
put
*NL*
upon
her
bed
with
pen
and
paper
,
and
at
her
request
she
was
left
alone
.
*NL*
She
remained
writing
for
a
short
time
,
folded
her
paper
carefully
,
*NL*
called
Elizabeth-Jane
to
bring
a
taper
and
wax
,
and
then
,
still
refusing
*NL*
assistance
,
sealed
up
the
sheet
,
directed
it
,
and
locked
it
in
her
desk
.
*NL*
She
had
directed
it
in
these
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MR.
MICHAEL
HENCHARD
.
NOT
TO
BE
OPENED
TILL
ELIZABETH-JANE
'S
*NL*
WEDDING-DAY
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
sat
up
with
her
mother
to
the
utmost
of
her
strength
night
*NL*
after
night
.
To
learn
to
take
the
universe
seriously
there
is
no
quicker
*NL*
way
than
to
watch
--
to
be
a
``
waker
,
''
as
the
country-people
call
it
.
*NL*
Between
the
hours
at
which
the
last
toss-pot
went
by
and
the
first
*NL*
sparrow
shook
himself
,
the
silence
in
Casterbridge
--
barring
the
rare
*NL*
sound
of
the
watchman
--
was
broken
in
Elizabeth
's
ear
only
by
the
*NL*
time-piece
in
the
bedroom
ticking
frantically
against
the
clock
on
the
*NL*
stairs
;
ticking
harder
and
harder
till
it
seemed
to
clang
like
a
gong
;
*NL*
and
all
this
while
the
subtle-souled
girl
asking
herself
why
she
was
*NL*
born
,
why
sitting
in
a
room
,
and
blinking
at
the
candle
;
why
things
*NL*
around
her
had
taken
the
shape
they
wore
in
preference
to
every
other
*NL*
possible
shape
.
Why
they
stared
at
her
so
helplessly
,
as
if
waiting
*NL*
for
the
touch
of
some
wand
that
should
release
them
from
terrestrial
*NL*
constraint
;
what
that
chaos
called
consciousness
,
which
spun
in
her
at
*NL*
this
moment
like
a
top
,
tended
to
,
and
began
in
.
Her
eyes
fell
together
;
*NL*
she
was
awake
,
yet
she
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
word
from
her
mother
roused
her
.
Without
preface
,
and
as
the
*NL*
continuation
of
a
scene
already
progressing
in
her
mind
,
Mrs.
Henchard
*NL*
said
:
``
You
remember
the
note
sent
to
you
and
Mr.
Farfrae
--
asking
you
to
*NL*
meet
some
one
in
Durnover
Barton
--
and
that
you
thought
it
was
a
trick
to
*NL*
make
fools
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
to
make
fools
of
you
--
it
was
done
to
bring
you
together
.
*NL*
'T
was
I
did
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Elizabeth
,
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
wanted
you
to
marry
Mr.
Farfrae
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
mother
!
''
Elizabeth-Jane
bent
down
her
head
so
much
that
she
looked
*NL*
quite
into
her
own
lap
.
But
as
her
mother
did
not
go
on
,
she
said
,
``
What
*NL*
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
had
a
reason
.
`
Twill
out
one
day
.
I
wish
it
could
have
been
in
*NL*
my
time
!
But
there
--
nothing
is
as
you
wish
it
!
Henchard
hates
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
'll
be
friends
again
,
''
murmured
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
know
.
''
After
this
her
mother
was
silent
,
and
*NL*
dozed
;
and
she
spoke
on
the
subject
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
little
time
later
on
Farfrae
was
passing
Henchard
's
house
on
a
*NL*
Sunday
morning
,
when
he
observed
that
the
blinds
were
all
down
.
He
rang
*NL*
the
bell
so
softly
that
it
only
sounded
a
single
full
note
and
a
*NL*
small
one
;
and
then
he
was
informed
that
Mrs.
Henchard
was
dead
--
just
*NL*
dead
--
that
very
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
town-pump
there
were
gathered
when
he
passed
a
few
old
*NL*
inhabitants
,
who
came
there
for
water
whenever
they
had
,
as
at
present
,
*NL*
spare
time
to
fetch
it
,
because
it
was
purer
from
that
original
fount
*NL*
than
from
their
own
wells
.
Mrs.
Cuxsom
,
who
had
been
standing
there
for
*NL*
an
indefinite
time
with
her
pitcher
,
was
describing
the
incidents
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Henchard
's
death
,
as
she
had
learnt
them
from
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
was
white
as
marble-stone
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cuxsom
.
``
And
likewise
*NL*
such
a
thoughtful
woman
,
too
--
ah
,
poor
soul
--
that
a
'
minded
every
little
*NL*
thing
that
wanted
tending
.
`
Yes
,
'
says
she
,
`
when
I
'm
gone
,
and
my
last
*NL*
breath
's
blowed
,
look
in
the
top
drawer
o
'
the
chest
in
the
back
room
*NL*
by
the
window
,
and
you
'll
find
all
my
coffin
clothes
,
a
piece
of
*NL*
flannel
--
that
's
to
put
under
me
,
and
the
little
piece
is
to
put
under
my
*NL*
head
;
and
my
new
stockings
for
my
feet
--
they
are
folded
alongside
,
and
*NL*
all
my
other
things
.
And
there
's
four
ounce
pennies
,
the
heaviest
I
*NL*
could
find
,
a-tied
up
in
bits
of
linen
,
for
weights

two
for
my
right
*NL*
eye
and
two
for
my
left

she
said
.
`
And
when
you
've
used
'em
,
and
my
*NL*
eyes
do
n't
open
no
more
,
bury
the
pennies

good
souls
and
do
n't
ye
go
*NL*
spending
'em
,
for
I
should
n't
like
it
.
And
open
the
windows
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
am
carried
out
,
and
make
it
as
cheerful
as
you
can
for
Elizabeth-Jane
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

poor
heart
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
Martha
did
it
,

buried
the

pennies
in
the
garden

*NL*
But
if
ye
'll
believe
words
,
that
man
,
Christopher
Coney
,
went
and
dug
*NL*
'em
up
,
and
spent
'em
at
the
Three
Mariners
.
`
Faith
,
'
he
said
,
`
why
*NL*
should
death
rob
life
o
'
fourpence
?
Death
's
not
of
such
good
report
that
*NL*
we
should
respect
`
en
to
that
extent
,
'
says
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
a
cannibal
deed

deprecated
her
listeners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gad
,
then
I
wo
n't
quite
ha'e

said
Solomon
Longways
.
``
I
say
it

to-day

Sunday
morning

I
would
n't

wrongfully
for
*NL*
a
zilver
zixpence
at
such
a
time
.
I
do
n't
see
noo
harm
in
it

To
respect
*NL*
the
dead
is
sound
doxology
;
and
I
would
n't
sell
skellintons

leastwise
*NL*
respectable
skellintons
--
to
be
varnished
for
`
natomies
,
except
I
were
*NL*
out
o

work

But
money
is
scarce
,
and
throats
get
dry

Why
SHOULD
death
*NL*
rob
life
o

fourpence

I
say
there
was
no
treason
in
it

*NL*
``
Well

poor
soul

she
's
helpless

Mother
Cuxsom

all

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
and
Elizabeth
sat
conversing
by
the
fire
.
It
was
three
weeks
*NL*
after
Mrs.
Henchard
's
funeral
,
the
candles
were
not
lighted
,
and
a
*NL*
restless
,
acrobatic
flame
,
poised
on
a
coal
,
called
from
the
shady
walls
*NL*
the
smiles
of
all
shapes
that
could
respond
--
the
old
pier-glass
,
with
*NL*
gilt
columns
and
huge
entablature
,
the
picture-frames
,
sundry
knobs
and
*NL*
handles
,
and
the
brass
rosette
at
the
bottom
of
each
riband
bell-pull
on
*NL*
either
side
of
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
,
do
you
think
much
of
old
times
?
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
often

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
put
in
your
pictures

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
and
father

nobody
else
hardly

''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
always
looked
like
one
bent
on
resisting
pain
when
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
spoke
of
Richard
Newson
as
``
father
.
''
``
Ah
!
I
am
out
of
all
*NL*
that
,
am
I
not
?

he
said
...
``
Was
Newson
a
kind
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
face
settled
into
an
expression
of
stolid
loneliness
which
*NL*
gradually
modulated
into
something
softer
.
``
Suppose
I
had
been
your
real
*NL*
father
?
''
he
said
.
``
Would
you
have
cared
for
me
as
much
as
you
cared
for
*NL*
Richard
Newson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
think
it
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
I
can
think
of
no
other
as
my
*NL*
father
,
except
my
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
wife
was
dissevered
from
him
by
death
;
his
friend
and
helper
*NL*
Farfrae
by
estrangement
;
Elizabeth-Jane
by
ignorance
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
only
one
of
them
could
possibly
be
recalled
,
and
that
was
the
girl
.
*NL*
His
mind
began
vibrating
between
the
wish
to
reveal
himself
to
her
and
*NL*
the
policy
of
leaving
well
alone
,
till
he
could
no
longer
sit
still
.
He
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
,
and
then
he
came
and
stood
behind
her
chair
,
looking
*NL*
down
upon
the
top
of
her
head
.
He
could
no
longer
restrain
his
impulse
.
*NL*
``
What
did
your
mother
tell
you
about
me
--
my
history
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
were
related
by
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
should
have
told
more
--
before
you
knew
me
!
Then
my
task
would
not
*NL*
have
been
such
a
hard
one
...
Elizabeth
,
it
is
I
who
am
your
father
,
and
*NL*
not
Richard
Newson
.
Shame
alone
prevented
your
wretched
parents
from
*NL*
owning
this
to
you
while
both
of
'em
were
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
back
of
Elizabeth
's
head
remained
still
,
and
her
shoulders
did
not
*NL*
denote
even
the
movements
of
breathing
.
Henchard
went
on
:
``
I
'd
rather
*NL*
have
your
scorn
,
your
fear
,
anything
than
your
ignorance
;
't
is
that
I
*NL*
hate
!
Your
mother
and
I
were
man
and
wife
when
we
were
young
.
What
you
*NL*
saw
was
our
second
marriage
.
Your
mother
was
too
honest
.
We
had
thought
*NL*
each
other
dead
--
and
--
Newson
became
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
nearest
approach
Henchard
could
make
to
the
full
truth
.
As
*NL*
far
as
he
personally
was
concerned
he
would
have
screened
nothing
;
*NL*
but
he
showed
a
respect
for
the
young
girl
's
sex
and
years
worthy
of
a
*NL*
better
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
on
to
give
details
which
a
whole
series
of
slight
and
*NL*
unregarded
incidents
in
her
past
life
strangely
corroborated
;
when
,
in
*NL*
short
,
she
believed
his
story
to
be
true
,
she
became
greatly
agitated
,
*NL*
and
turning
round
to
the
table
flung
her
face
upon
it
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
--
do
n't
cry
!
''
said
Henchard
,
with
vehement
pathos
,
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
it
,
I
wo
n't
bear
it
.
I
am
your
father
;
why
should
you
cry
?
Am
I
so
*NL*
dreadful
,
so
hateful
to
`
ee
?
Do
n't
take
against
me
,
Elizabeth-Jane
!
''
*NL*
he
cried
,
grasping
her
wet
hand
.
``
Do
n't
take
against
me
--
though
I
was
a
*NL*
drinking
man
once
,
and
used
your
mother
roughly
--
I
'll
be
kinder
to
you
*NL*
than
HE
was
!
I
'll
do
anything
,
if
you
will
only
look
upon
me
as
your
*NL*
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
stand
up
and
comfort
him
trustfully
;
but
she
could
not
;
she
*NL*
was
troubled
at
his
presence
,
like
the
brethren
at
the
avowal
of
Joseph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
come
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
,
''
said
Henchard
in
*NL*
jerks
,
and
moving
like
a
great
tree
in
a
wind
.
``
No
,
Elizabeth
,
I
do
n't
.
*NL*
I
'll
go
away
and
not
see
you
till
to-morrow
,
or
when
you
like
,
and
then
*NL*
I
'll
show
`
ee
papers
to
prove
my
words
.
There
,
I
am
gone
,
and
wo
n't
*NL*
disturb
you
any
more
...
'T
was
I
that
chose
your
name
,
my
daughter
;
your
*NL*
mother
wanted
it
Susan
.
There
,
do
n't
forget
't
was
I
gave
you
your
name
!
''
*NL*
He
went
out
at
the
door
and
shut
her
softly
in
,
and
she
heard
him
go
*NL*
away
into
the
garden
.
But
he
had
not
done
.
Before
she
had
moved
,
or
in
*NL*
any
way
recovered
from
the
effect
of
his
disclosure
,
he
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
more
,
Elizabeth
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
'll
take
my
surname
now
--
hey
?
*NL*
Your
mother
was
against
it
,
but
it
will
be
much
more
pleasant
to
me
.
*NL*
'T
is
legally
yours
,
you
know
.
But
nobody
need
know
that
.
You
shall
take
*NL*
it
as
if
by
choice
.
I
'll
talk
to
my
lawyer
--
I
do
n't
know
the
law
of
it
*NL*
exactly
;
but
will
you
do
this
--
let
me
put
a
few
lines
into
the
newspaper
*NL*
that
such
is
to
be
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
my
name
I
must
have
it
,
must
n't
I
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
;
usage
is
everything
in
these
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
mother
did
n't
wish
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
some
whim
of
the
poor
soul
's
.
Now
get
a
bit
of
paper
and
draw
up
a
*NL*
paragraph
as
I
shall
tell
you
.
But
let
's
have
a
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
by
the
firelight
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Yes
--
I
'd
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
bending
over
the
fender
wrote
at
*NL*
his
dictation
words
which
he
had
evidently
got
by
heart
from
some
*NL*
advertisement
or
other
--
words
to
the
effect
that
she
,
the
writer
,
*NL*
hitherto
known
as
Elizabeth-Jane
Newson
,
was
going
to
call
herself
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
Henchard
forthwith
.
It
was
done
,
and
fastened
up
,
and
*NL*
directed
to
the
office
of
the
Casterbridge
Chronicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Henchard
,
with
the
blaze
of
satisfaction
that
he
always
*NL*
emitted
when
he
had
carried
his
point
--
though
tenderness
softened
it
*NL*
this
time
--
``
I
'll
go
upstairs
and
hunt
for
some
documents
that
will
*NL*
prove
it
all
to
you
.
But
I
wo
n't
trouble
you
with
them
till
to-morrow
.
*NL*
Good-night
,
my
Elizabeth-Jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gone
before
the
bewildered
girl
could
realize
what
it
all
*NL*
meant
,
or
adjust
her
filial
sense
to
the
new
center
of
gravity
.
She
was
*NL*
thankful
that
he
had
left
her
to
herself
for
the
evening
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
over
the
fire
.
Here
she
remained
in
silence
,
and
wept
--
not
for
her
*NL*
mother
now
,
but
for
the
genial
sailor
Richard
Newson
,
to
whom
she
seemed
*NL*
doing
a
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
in
the
meantime
had
gone
upstairs
.
Papers
of
a
domestic
nature
*NL*
he
kept
in
a
drawer
in
his
bedroom
,
and
this
he
unlocked
.
Before
turning
*NL*
them
over
he
leant
back
and
indulged
in
reposeful
thought
.
Elizabeth
was
*NL*
his
at
last
and
she
was
a
girl
of
such
good
sense
and
kind
heart
that
*NL*
she
would
be
sure
to
like
him
.
He
was
the
kind
of
man
to
whom
some
*NL*
human
object
for
pouring
out
his
heart
upon
--
were
it
emotive
or
were
*NL*
it
choleric
--
was
almost
a
necessity
.
The
craving
for
his
heart
for
the
*NL*
re-establishment
of
this
tenderest
human
tie
had
been
great
during
*NL*
his
wife
's
lifetime
,
and
now
he
had
submitted
to
its
mastery
without
*NL*
reluctance
and
without
fear
.
He
bent
over
the
drawer
again
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
in
his
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
other
papers
had
been
placed
the
contents
of
his
wife
's
little
*NL*
desk
,
the
keys
of
which
had
been
handed
to
him
at
her
request
.
Here
was
*NL*
the
letter
addressed
to
him
with
the
restriction
,
``
NOT
TO
BE
OPENED
TILL
*NL*
ELIZABETH-JANE
'S
WEDDING-DAY
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Henchard
,
though
more
patient
than
her
husband
,
had
been
no
*NL*
practical
hand
at
anything
.
In
sealing
up
the
sheet
,
which
was
folded
*NL*
and
tucked
in
without
an
envelope
,
in
the
old-fashioned
way
,
she
had
*NL*
overlaid
the
junction
with
a
large
mass
of
wax
without
the
requisite
*NL*
under-touch
of
the
same
.
The
seal
had
cracked
,
and
the
letter
was
open
.
*NL*
Henchard
had
no
reason
to
suppose
the
restriction
one
of
serious
weight
,
*NL*
and
his
feeling
for
his
late
wife
had
not
been
of
the
nature
of
deep
*NL*
respect
.
``
Some
trifling
fancy
or
other
of
poor
Susan
's
,
I
suppose
,
''
he
*NL*
said
;
and
without
curiosity
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
scan
the
letter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
MICHAEL
,
--
For
the
good
of
all
three
of
us
I
have
kept
one
thing
*NL*
a
secret
from
you
till
now
.
I
hope
you
will
understand
why
;
I
think
you
*NL*
will
;
though
perhaps
you
may
not
forgive
me
.
But
,
dear
Michael
,
I
have
*NL*
done
it
for
the
best
.
I
shall
be
in
my
grave
when
you
read
this
,
and
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
will
have
a
home
.
Do
n't
curse
me
Mike
--
think
of
how
I
was
*NL*
situated
.
I
can
hardly
write
it
,
but
here
it
is
.
Elizabeth-Jane
is
not
*NL*
your
Elizabeth-Jane
--
the
child
who
was
in
my
arms
when
you
sold
me
.
*NL*
No
;
she
died
three
months
after
that
,
and
this
living
one
is
my
other
*NL*
husband
's
.
I
christened
her
by
the
same
name
we
had
given
to
the
first
,
*NL*
and
she
filled
up
the
ache
I
felt
at
the
other
's
loss
.
Michael
,
I
*NL*
am
dying
,
and
I
might
have
held
my
tongue
;
but
I
could
not
.
Tell
her
*NL*
husband
of
this
or
not
,
as
you
may
judge
;
and
forgive
,
if
you
can
,
a
*NL*
woman
you
once
deeply
wronged
,
as
she
forgives
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
SUSAN
HENCHARD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
regarded
the
paper
as
if
it
were
a
window-pane
through
*NL*
which
he
saw
for
miles
.
His
lips
twitched
,
and
he
seemed
to
compress
his
*NL*
frame
,
as
if
to
bear
better
.
His
usual
habit
was
not
to
consider
whether
*NL*
destiny
were
hard
upon
him
or
not
--
the
shape
of
his
ideals
in
cases
of
*NL*
affliction
being
simply
a
moody
``
I
am
to
suffer
,
I
perceive
.
''
``
This
*NL*
much
scourging
,
then
,
it
is
for
me
.
''
But
now
through
his
passionate
head
*NL*
there
stormed
this
thought
--
that
the
blasting
disclosure
was
what
he
had
*NL*
deserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
's
extreme
reluctance
to
have
the
girl
's
name
altered
from
*NL*
Newson
to
Henchard
was
now
accounted
for
fully
.
It
furnished
another
*NL*
illustration
of
that
honesty
in
dishonesty
which
had
characterized
her
*NL*
in
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
unnerved
and
purposeless
for
near
a
couple
of
hours
;
till
he
*NL*
suddenly
said
,
``
Ah
--
I
wonder
if
it
is
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
in
an
impulse
,
kicked
off
his
slippers
,
and
went
with
a
*NL*
candle
to
the
door
of
Elizabeth-Jane
's
room
,
where
he
put
his
ear
to
*NL*
the
keyhole
and
listened
.
She
was
breathing
profoundly
.
Henchard
softly
*NL*
turned
the
handle
,
entered
,
and
shading
the
light
,
approached
the
*NL*
bedside
.
Gradually
bringing
the
light
from
behind
a
screening
curtain
*NL*
he
held
it
in
such
a
manner
that
it
fell
slantwise
on
her
face
without
*NL*
shining
on
her
eyes
.
He
steadfastly
regarded
her
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
fair
:
his
were
dark
.
But
this
was
an
unimportant
preliminary
.
*NL*
In
sleep
there
come
to
the
surface
buried
genealogical
facts
,
ancestral
*NL*
curves
,
dead
men
's
traits
,
which
the
mobility
of
daytime
animation
*NL*
screens
and
overwhelms
.
In
the
present
statuesque
repose
of
the
young
*NL*
girl
's
countenance
Richard
Newson
's
was
unmistakably
reflected
.
He
could
*NL*
not
endure
the
sight
of
her
,
and
hastened
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Misery
taught
him
nothing
more
than
defiant
endurance
of
it
.
His
wife
*NL*
was
dead
,
and
the
first
impulse
for
revenge
died
with
the
thought
that
*NL*
she
was
beyond
him
.
He
looked
out
at
the
night
as
at
a
fiend
.
Henchard
,
*NL*
like
all
his
kind
,
was
superstitious
,
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
*NL*
that
the
concatenation
of
events
this
evening
had
produced
was
the
*NL*
scheme
of
some
sinister
intelligence
bent
on
punishing
him
.
Yet
they
*NL*
had
developed
naturally
.
If
he
had
not
revealed
his
past
history
to
*NL*
Elizabeth
he
would
not
have
searched
the
drawer
for
papers
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
The
mockery
was
,
that
he
should
have
no
sooner
taught
a
girl
to
claim
*NL*
the
shelter
of
his
paternity
than
he
discovered
her
to
have
no
kinship
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
ironical
sequence
of
things
angered
him
like
an
impish
trick
from
*NL*
a
fellow-creature
.
Like
Prester
John
's
,
his
table
had
been
spread
,
and
*NL*
infernal
harpies
had
snatched
up
the
food
.
He
went
out
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
moved
sullenly
onward
down
the
pavement
till
he
came
to
the
bridge
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
High
Street
.
Here
he
turned
in
upon
a
bypath
on
the
*NL*
river
bank
,
skirting
the
north-eastern
limits
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
precincts
embodied
the
mournful
phases
of
Casterbridge
life
,
as
*NL*
the
south
avenues
embodied
its
cheerful
moods
.
The
whole
way
along
here
*NL*
was
sunless
,
even
in
summer
time
;
in
spring
,
white
frosts
lingered
here
*NL*
when
other
places
were
steaming
with
warmth
;
while
in
winter
it
was
the
*NL*
seed-field
of
all
the
aches
,
rheumatisms
,
and
torturing
cramps
of
*NL*
the
year
.
The
Casterbridge
doctors
must
have
pined
away
for
want
of
*NL*
sufficient
nourishment
but
for
the
configuration
of
the
landscape
on
the
*NL*
north-eastern
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
--
slow
,
noiseless
,
and
dark
--
the
Schwarzwasser
of
*NL*
Casterbridge
--
ran
beneath
a
low
cliff
,
the
two
together
forming
a
*NL*
defence
which
had
rendered
walls
and
artificial
earthworks
on
this
side
*NL*
unnecessary
.
Here
were
ruins
of
a
Franciscan
priory
,
and
a
mill
attached
*NL*
to
the
same
,
the
water
of
which
roared
down
a
back-hatch
like
the
voice
*NL*
of
desolation
.
Above
the
cliff
,
and
behind
the
river
,
rose
a
pile
of
*NL*
buildings
,
and
in
the
front
of
the
pile
a
square
mass
cut
into
the
sky
.
*NL*
It
was
like
a
pedestal
lacking
its
statue
.
This
missing
feature
,
without
*NL*
which
the
design
remained
incomplete
,
was
,
in
truth
,
the
corpse
of
a
*NL*
man
,
for
the
square
mass
formed
the
base
of
the
gallows
,
the
extensive
*NL*
buildings
at
the
back
being
the
county
gaol
.
In
the
meadow
where
*NL*
Henchard
now
walked
the
mob
were
wont
to
gather
whenever
an
execution
*NL*
took
place
,
and
there
to
the
tune
of
the
roaring
weir
they
stood
and
*NL*
watched
the
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exaggeration
which
darkness
imparted
to
the
glooms
of
this
region
*NL*
impressed
Henchard
more
than
he
had
expected
.
The
lugubrious
harmony
of
*NL*
the
spot
with
his
domestic
situation
was
too
perfect
for
him
,
impatient
*NL*
of
effects
scenes
,
and
adumbrations
.
It
reduced
his
heartburning
to
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
he
exclaimed
,
``
Why
the
deuce
did
I
come
here
!
''
He
went
*NL*
on
past
the
cottage
in
which
the
old
local
hangman
had
lived
and
died
,
*NL*
in
times
before
that
calling
was
monopolized
over
all
England
by
a
*NL*
single
gentleman
;
and
climbed
up
by
a
steep
back
lane
into
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
sufferings
of
that
night
,
engendered
by
his
bitter
*NL*
disappointment
,
he
might
well
have
been
pitied
.
He
was
like
one
who
had
*NL*
half
fainted
,
and
could
neither
recover
nor
complete
the
swoon
.
In
words
*NL*
he
could
blame
his
wife
,
but
not
in
his
heart
;
and
had
he
obeyed
the
*NL*
wise
directions
outside
her
letter
this
pain
would
have
been
spared
him
*NL*
for
long
--
possibly
for
ever
,
Elizabeth-Jane
seeming
to
show
no
ambition
*NL*
to
quit
her
safe
and
secluded
maiden
courses
for
the
speculative
path
of
*NL*
matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
came
after
this
night
of
unrest
,
and
with
it
the
necessity
*NL*
for
a
plan
.
He
was
far
too
self-willed
to
recede
from
a
position
,
*NL*
especially
as
it
would
involve
humiliation
.
His
daughter
he
had
asserted
*NL*
her
to
be
,
and
his
daughter
she
should
always
think
herself
,
no
matter
*NL*
what
hyprocrisy
it
involved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
ill-prepared
for
the
first
step
in
this
new
situation
.
The
*NL*
moment
he
came
into
the
breakfast-room
Elizabeth
advanced
with
open
*NL*
confidence
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
and
thought
all
night
of
it
,
''
she
said
frankly
.
``
And
I
*NL*
see
that
everything
must
be
as
you
say
.
And
I
am
going
to
look
upon
you
*NL*
as
the
father
that
you
are
,
and
not
to
call
you
Mr.
Henchard
any
more
.
*NL*
It
is
so
plain
to
me
now
.
Indeed
,
father
,
it
is
.
For
,
of
course
,
you
*NL*
would
not
have
done
half
the
things
you
have
done
for
me
,
and
let
me
*NL*
have
my
own
way
so
entirely
,
and
bought
me
presents
,
if
I
had
only
been
*NL*
your
step-daughter
!
He
--
Mr.
Newson
--
whom
my
poor
mother
married
by
such
*NL*
a
strange
mistake
''
-LRB-
Henchard
was
glad
that
he
had
disguised
matters
*NL*
here
-RRB-
,
``
was
very
kind
--
O
so
kind
!
''
-LRB-
she
spoke
with
tears
in
her
eyes
-RRB-
;
*NL*
``
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
being
one
's
real
father
after
all
.
*NL*
Now
,
father
,
breakfast
is
ready
!
''
she
said
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
bent
and
kissed
her
cheek
.
The
moment
and
the
act
he
had
*NL*
prefigured
for
weeks
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
;
yet
it
was
no
less
than
*NL*
a
miserable
insipidity
to
him
now
that
it
had
come
.
His
reinstation
of
*NL*
her
mother
had
been
chiefly
for
the
girl
's
sake
,
and
the
fruition
of
the
*NL*
whole
scheme
was
such
dust
and
ashes
as
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
20
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
enigmas
which
ever
confronted
a
girl
there
can
have
been
*NL*
seldom
one
like
that
which
followed
Henchard
's
announcement
of
himself
*NL*
to
Elizabeth
as
her
father
.
He
had
done
it
in
an
ardour
and
an
agitation
*NL*
which
had
half
carried
the
point
of
affection
with
her
;
yet
,
behold
,
*NL*
from
the
next
morning
onwards
his
manner
was
constrained
as
she
had
*NL*
never
seen
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coldness
soon
broke
out
into
open
chiding
.
One
grievous
failing
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
was
her
occasional
pretty
and
picturesque
use
of
dialect
*NL*
words
--
those
terrible
marks
of
the
beast
to
the
truly
genteel
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dinner-time
--
they
never
met
except
at
meals
--
and
she
happened
to
*NL*
say
when
he
was
rising
from
table
,
wishing
to
show
him
something
,
``
If
*NL*
you
'll
bide
where
you
be
a
minute
,
father
,
I
'll
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Bide
where
you
be
,
'
''
he
echoed
sharply
,
``
Good
God
,
are
you
only
fit
to
*NL*
carry
wash
to
a
pig-trough
,
that
ye
use
such
words
as
those
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reddened
with
shame
and
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
`
Stay
where
you
are
,
'
father
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
,
humble
*NL*
voice
.
``
I
ought
to
have
been
more
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sharp
reprimand
was
not
lost
upon
her
,
and
in
time
it
came
to
*NL*
pass
that
for
``
fay
''
she
said
``
succeed
''
;
that
she
no
longer
spoke
of
*NL*
``
dumbledores
''
but
of
``
humble
bees
''
;
no
longer
said
of
young
men
and
*NL*
women
that
they
``
walked
together
,
''
but
that
they
were
``
engaged
''
;
that
*NL*
she
grew
to
talk
of
``
greggles
''
as
``
wild
hyacinths
''
;
that
when
she
had
*NL*
not
slept
she
did
not
quaintly
tell
the
servants
next
morning
that
she
*NL*
had
been
``
hag-rid
,
''
but
that
she
had
``
suffered
from
indigestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
improvements
,
however
,
are
somewhat
in
advance
of
the
story
.
*NL*
Henchard
,
being
uncultivated
himself
,
was
the
bitterest
critic
the
fair
*NL*
girl
could
possibly
have
had
of
her
own
lapses
--
really
slight
now
,
for
*NL*
she
read
omnivorously
.
A
gratuitous
ordeal
was
in
store
for
her
in
the
*NL*
matter
of
her
handwriting
.
She
was
passing
the
dining-room
door
one
*NL*
evening
,
and
had
occasion
to
go
in
for
something
.
It
was
not
till
she
*NL*
had
opened
the
door
that
she
knew
the
Mayor
was
there
in
the
company
of
*NL*
a
man
with
whom
he
transacted
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Elizabeth-Jane
,
''
he
said
,
looking
round
at
her
,
``
just
write
down
*NL*
what
I
tell
you
--
a
few
words
of
an
agreement
for
me
and
this
gentleman
*NL*
to
sign
.
I
am
a
poor
tool
with
a
pen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
jowned
,
and
so
be
I
,
''
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
brought
forward
blotting-book
,
paper
,
and
ink
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
--
`
An
agreement
entered
into
this
sixteenth
day
of
*NL*
October
'
--
write
that
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
the
pen
in
an
elephantine
march
across
the
sheet
.
It
was
a
*NL*
splendid
round
,
bold
hand
of
her
own
conception
,
a
style
that
would
have
*NL*
stamped
a
woman
as
Minerva
's
own
in
more
recent
days
.
But
other
ideas
*NL*
reigned
then
:
Henchard
's
creed
was
that
proper
young
girls
wrote
*NL*
ladies
'
-
hand
--
nay
,
he
believed
that
bristling
characters
were
as
innate
*NL*
and
inseparable
a
part
of
refined
womanhood
as
sex
itself
.
Hence
when
,
*NL*
instead
of
scribbling
,
like
the
Princess
Ida
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
a
hand
as
when
a
field
of
corn
*NL*
Bows
all
its
ears
before
the
roaring
East
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
produced
a
line
of
chain-shot
and
sand-bags
,
he
reddened
*NL*
in
angry
shame
for
her
,
and
,
peremptorily
saying
,
``
Never
mind
--
I
'll
*NL*
finish
it
,
''
dismissed
her
there
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
considerate
disposition
became
a
pitfall
to
her
now
.
She
was
,
it
*NL*
must
be
admitted
,
sometimes
provokingly
and
unnecessarily
willing
to
*NL*
saddle
herself
with
manual
labours
.
She
would
go
to
the
kitchen
instead
*NL*
of
ringing
,
``
Not
to
make
Phoebe
come
up
twice
.
''
She
went
down
on
*NL*
her
knees
,
shovel
in
hand
,
when
the
cat
overturned
the
coal-scuttle
;
*NL*
moreover
,
she
would
persistently
thank
the
parlour-maid
for
everything
,
*NL*
till
one
day
,
as
soon
as
the
girl
was
gone
from
the
room
,
Henchard
broke
*NL*
out
with
,
``
Good
God
,
why
dost
n't
leave
off
thanking
that
girl
as
if
she
*NL*
were
a
goddess-born
!
Do
n't
I
pay
her
a
dozen
pound
a
year
to
do
things
*NL*
for
`
ee
?
''
Elizabeth
shrank
so
visibly
at
the
exclamation
that
he
became
*NL*
sorry
a
few
minutes
after
,
and
said
that
he
did
not
mean
to
be
rough
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
domestic
exhibitions
were
the
small
protruding
needlerocks
which
*NL*
suggested
rather
than
revealed
what
was
underneath
.
But
his
passion
had
*NL*
less
terror
for
her
than
his
coldness
.
The
increasing
frequency
of
the
*NL*
latter
mood
told
her
the
sad
news
that
he
disliked
her
with
a
growing
*NL*
dislike
.
The
more
interesting
that
her
appearance
and
manners
became
*NL*
under
the
softening
influences
which
she
could
now
command
,
and
in
her
*NL*
wisdom
did
command
,
the
more
she
seemed
to
estrange
him
.
Sometimes
she
*NL*
caught
him
looking
at
her
with
a
louring
invidiousness
that
she
could
*NL*
hardly
bear
.
Not
knowing
his
secret
it
was
cruel
mockery
that
she
should
*NL*
for
the
first
time
excite
his
animosity
when
she
had
taken
his
surname
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
most
terrible
ordeal
was
to
come
.
Elizabeth
had
latterly
*NL*
been
accustomed
of
an
afternoon
to
present
a
cup
of
cider
or
ale
and
*NL*
bread-and-cheese
to
Nance
Mockridge
,
who
worked
in
the
yard
wimbling
*NL*
hay-bonds
.
Nance
accepted
this
offering
thankfully
at
first
;
afterwards
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
course
.
On
a
day
when
Henchard
was
on
the
premises
he
saw
*NL*
his
step-daughter
enter
the
hay-barn
on
this
errand
;
and
,
as
there
was
*NL*
no
clear
spot
on
which
to
deposit
the
provisions
,
she
at
once
set
*NL*
to
work
arranging
two
trusses
of
hay
as
a
table
,
Mockridge
meanwhile
*NL*
standing
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
,
easefully
looking
at
the
*NL*
preparations
on
her
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
,
come
here
!
''
said
Henchard
;
and
she
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
lower
yourself
so
confoundedly
?
''
he
said
with
suppressed
*NL*
passion
.
``
Have
n't
I
told
you
o
'
t
fifty
times
?
Hey
?
Making
yourself
a
*NL*
drudge
for
a
common
workwoman
of
such
a
character
as
hers
!
Why
,
ye
'll
*NL*
disgrace
me
to
the
dust
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
these
words
were
uttered
loud
enough
to
reach
Nance
inside
the
barn
*NL*
door
,
who
fired
up
immediately
at
the
slur
upon
her
personal
character
.
*NL*
Coming
to
the
door
she
cried
regardless
of
consequences
,
``
Come
to
that
,
*NL*
Mr.
Henchard
,
I
can
let
`
ee
know
she
've
waited
on
worse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
must
have
had
more
charity
than
sense
,
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
she
had
n't
.
`
Twere
not
for
charity
but
for
hire
;
and
at
a
*NL*
public-house
in
this
town
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
true
!
''
cried
Henchard
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
ask
her
,
''
said
Nance
,
folding
her
naked
arms
in
such
a
manner
that
*NL*
she
could
comfortably
scratch
her
elbows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
glanced
at
Elizabeth-Jane
,
whose
complexion
,
now
pink
and
white
*NL*
from
confinement
,
lost
nearly
all
of
the
former
colour
.
``
What
does
this
*NL*
mean
?
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
Anything
or
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
``
But
it
was
only
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
do
it
,
or
did
n't
you
?
Where
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Three
Mariners
;
one
evening
for
a
little
while
,
when
we
were
*NL*
staying
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nance
glanced
triumphantly
at
Henchard
,
and
sailed
into
the
barn
;
for
*NL*
assuming
that
she
was
to
be
discharged
on
the
instant
she
had
resolved
*NL*
to
make
the
most
of
her
victory
.
Henchard
,
however
,
said
nothing
about
*NL*
discharging
her
.
Unduly
sensitive
on
such
points
by
reason
of
his
*NL*
own
past
,
he
had
the
look
of
one
completely
ground
down
to
the
last
*NL*
indignity
.
Elizabeth
followed
him
to
the
house
like
a
culprit
;
but
when
*NL*
she
got
inside
she
could
not
see
him
.
Nor
did
she
see
him
again
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Convinced
of
the
scathing
damage
to
his
local
repute
and
position
that
*NL*
must
have
been
caused
by
such
a
fact
,
though
it
had
never
before
reached
*NL*
his
own
ears
,
Henchard
showed
a
positive
distaste
for
the
presence
of
*NL*
this
girl
not
his
own
,
whenever
he
encountered
her
.
He
mostly
dined
with
*NL*
the
farmers
at
the
market-room
of
one
of
the
two
chief
hotels
,
leaving
*NL*
her
in
utter
solitude
.
Could
he
have
seen
how
she
made
use
of
those
*NL*
silent
hours
he
might
have
found
reason
to
reserve
his
judgment
on
*NL*
her
quality
.
She
read
and
took
notes
incessantly
,
mastering
facts
with
*NL*
painful
laboriousness
,
but
never
flinching
from
her
self-imposed
task
.
*NL*
She
began
the
study
of
Latin
,
incited
by
the
Roman
characteristics
of
*NL*
the
town
she
lived
in
.
``
If
I
am
not
well-informed
it
shall
be
by
no
*NL*
fault
of
my
own
,
''
she
would
say
to
herself
through
the
tears
that
would
*NL*
occasionally
glide
down
her
peachy
cheeks
when
she
was
fairly
baffled
by
*NL*
the
portentous
obscurity
of
many
of
these
educational
works
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
lived
on
,
a
dumb
,
deep-feeling
,
great-eyed
creature
,
construed
*NL*
by
not
a
single
contiguous
being
;
quenching
with
patient
fortitude
*NL*
her
incipient
interest
in
Farfrae
,
because
it
seemed
to
be
one-sided
,
*NL*
unmaidenly
,
and
unwise
.
True
,
that
for
reasons
best
known
to
herself
,
*NL*
she
had
,
since
Farfrae
's
dismissal
,
shifted
her
quarters
from
the
back
*NL*
room
affording
a
view
of
the
yard
-LRB-
which
she
had
occupied
with
such
*NL*
zest
-RRB-
to
a
front
chamber
overlooking
the
street
;
but
as
for
the
young
*NL*
man
,
whenever
he
passed
the
house
he
seldom
or
never
turned
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winter
had
almost
come
,
and
unsettled
weather
made
her
still
more
*NL*
dependent
upon
indoor
resources
.
But
there
were
certain
early
winter
*NL*
days
in
Casterbridge
--
days
of
firmamental
exhaustion
which
followed
*NL*
angry
south-westerly
tempests
--
when
,
if
the
sun
shone
,
the
air
was
like
*NL*
velvet
.
She
seized
on
these
days
for
her
periodical
visits
to
the
spot
*NL*
where
her
mother
lay
buried
--
the
still-used
burial-ground
of
the
old
*NL*
Roman-British
city
,
whose
curious
feature
was
this
,
its
continuity
as
a
*NL*
place
of
sepulture
.
Mrs.
Henchard
's
dust
mingled
with
the
dust
of
women
*NL*
who
lay
ornamented
with
glass
hair-pins
and
amber
necklaces
,
and
men
who
*NL*
held
in
their
mouths
coins
of
Hadrian
,
Posthumus
,
and
the
Constantines
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half-past
ten
in
the
morning
was
about
her
hour
for
seeking
this
spot
--
a
*NL*
time
when
the
town
avenues
were
deserted
as
the
avenues
of
Karnac
.
*NL*
Business
had
long
since
passed
down
them
into
its
daily
cells
,
and
*NL*
Leisure
had
not
arrived
there
.
So
Elizabeth-Jane
walked
and
read
,
*NL*
or
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
book
to
think
,
and
thus
reached
the
*NL*
churchyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
approaching
her
mother
's
grave
she
saw
a
solitary
dark
figure
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
gravel-walk
.
This
figure
,
too
,
was
reading
;
but
not
*NL*
from
a
book
:
the
words
which
engrossed
it
being
the
inscription
on
Mrs.
*NL*
Henchard
's
tombstone
.
The
personage
was
in
mourning
like
herself
,
was
*NL*
about
her
age
and
size
,
and
might
have
been
her
wraith
or
double
,
but
*NL*
for
the
fact
that
it
was
a
lady
much
more
beautifully
dressed
than
she
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
comparatively
indifferent
as
Elizabeth-Jane
was
to
dress
,
*NL*
unless
for
some
temporary
whim
or
purpose
,
her
eyes
were
arrested
by
*NL*
the
artistic
perfection
of
the
lady
's
appearance
.
Her
gait
,
too
,
had
*NL*
a
flexuousness
about
it
,
which
seemed
to
avoid
angularity
.
It
was
a
*NL*
revelation
to
Elizabeth
that
human
beings
could
reach
this
stage
of
*NL*
external
development
--
she
had
never
suspected
it
.
She
felt
all
the
*NL*
freshness
and
grace
to
be
stolen
from
herself
on
the
instant
by
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
such
a
stranger
.
And
this
was
in
face
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
now
have
been
writ
handsome
,
while
the
young
lady
was
*NL*
simply
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
she
been
envious
she
might
have
hated
the
woman
;
but
she
did
not
*NL*
do
that
--
she
allowed
herself
the
pleasure
of
feeling
fascinated
.
She
*NL*
wondered
where
the
lady
had
come
from
.
The
stumpy
and
practical
walk
of
*NL*
honest
homeliness
which
mostly
prevailed
there
,
the
two
styles
of
dress
*NL*
thereabout
,
the
simple
and
the
mistaken
,
equally
avouched
that
*NL*
this
figure
was
no
Casterbridge
woman
's
,
even
if
a
book
in
her
hand
*NL*
resembling
a
guide-book
had
not
also
suggested
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
presently
moved
from
the
tombstone
of
Mrs.
Henchard
,
and
*NL*
vanished
behind
the
corner
of
the
wall
.
Elizabeth
went
to
the
tomb
*NL*
herself
;
beside
it
were
two
footprints
distinct
in
the
soil
,
signifying
*NL*
that
the
lady
had
stood
there
a
long
time
.
She
returned
homeward
,
*NL*
musing
on
what
she
had
seen
,
as
she
might
have
mused
on
a
rainbow
or
the
*NL*
Northern
Lights
,
a
rare
butterfly
or
a
cameo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Interesting
as
things
had
been
out
of
doors
,
at
home
it
turned
out
to
*NL*
be
one
of
her
bad
days
.
Henchard
,
whose
two
years
'
mayoralty
was
ending
,
*NL*
had
been
made
aware
that
he
was
not
to
be
chosen
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
*NL*
the
list
of
aldermen
;
and
that
Farfrae
was
likely
to
become
one
of
the
*NL*
Council
.
This
caused
the
unfortunate
discovery
that
she
had
played
the
*NL*
waiting-maid
in
the
town
of
which
he
was
Mayor
to
rankle
in
his
mind
yet
*NL*
more
poisonously
.
He
had
learnt
by
personal
inquiry
at
the
time
that
*NL*
it
was
to
Donald
Farfrae
--
that
treacherous
upstart
--
that
she
had
thus
*NL*
humiliated
herself
.
And
though
Mrs.
Stannidge
seemed
to
attach
no
great
*NL*
importance
to
the
incident
--
the
cheerful
souls
at
the
Three
Mariners
*NL*
having
exhausted
its
aspects
long
ago
--
such
was
Henchard
's
haughty
*NL*
spirit
that
the
simple
thrifty
deed
was
regarded
as
little
less
than
a
*NL*
social
catastrophe
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
the
evening
of
his
wife
's
arrival
with
her
daughter
there
had
*NL*
been
something
in
the
air
which
had
changed
his
luck
.
That
dinner
at
the
*NL*
King
's
Arms
with
his
friends
had
been
Henchard
's
Austerlitz
:
he
had
had
*NL*
his
successes
since
,
but
his
course
had
not
been
upward
.
He
was
not
*NL*
to
be
numbered
among
the
aldermen
--
that
Peerage
of
burghers
--
as
he
had
*NL*
expected
to
be
,
and
the
consciousness
of
this
soured
him
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
where
have
you
been
?
''
he
said
to
her
with
offhand
laconism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
strolling
in
the
Walks
and
churchyard
,
father
,
till
I
feel
*NL*
quite
leery
.
''
She
clapped
her
hand
to
her
mouth
,
but
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
just
enough
to
incense
Henchard
after
the
other
crosses
of
the
*NL*
day
.
``
I
WO
N'T
have
you
talk
like
that
!
''
he
thundered
.
''
`
Leery
,
'
indeed
.
*NL*
One
would
think
you
worked
upon
a
farm
!
One
day
I
learn
that
you
lend
*NL*
a
hand
in
public-houses
.
Then
I
hear
you
talk
like
a
clodhopper
.
I
'm
*NL*
burned
,
if
it
goes
on
,
this
house
ca
n't
hold
us
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
way
of
getting
a
single
pleasant
thought
to
go
to
sleep
upon
*NL*
after
this
was
by
recalling
the
lady
she
had
seen
that
day
,
and
hoping
*NL*
she
might
see
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Henchard
was
sitting
up
,
thinking
over
his
jealous
folly
in
*NL*
forbidding
Farfrae
to
pay
his
addresses
to
this
girl
who
did
not
belong
*NL*
to
him
,
when
if
he
had
allowed
them
to
go
on
he
might
not
have
been
*NL*
encumbered
with
her
.
At
last
he
said
to
himself
with
satisfaction
as
*NL*
he
jumped
up
and
went
to
the
writing-table
:
``
Ah
!
he
'll
think
it
means
*NL*
peace
,
and
a
marriage
portion
--
not
that
I
do
n't
want
my
house
to
be
*NL*
troubled
with
her
,
and
no
portion
at
all
!
''
He
wrote
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
--
On
consideration
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
interfere
with
your
courtship
of
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
if
you
care
for
her
.
I
therefore
withdraw
my
objection
;
*NL*
excepting
in
this
--
that
the
business
be
not
carried
on
in
my
house
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Yours
,
*NL*
*NL*
M.
HENCHARD
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
morrow
,
being
fairly
fine
,
found
Elizabeth-Jane
again
in
the
*NL*
churchyard
,
but
while
looking
for
the
lady
she
was
startled
by
the
*NL*
apparition
of
Farfrae
,
who
passed
outside
the
gate
.
He
glanced
up
for
a
*NL*
moment
from
a
pocket-book
in
which
he
appeared
to
be
making
figures
as
*NL*
he
went
;
whether
or
not
he
saw
her
he
took
no
notice
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unduly
depressed
by
a
sense
of
her
own
superfluity
she
thought
he
*NL*
probably
scorned
her
;
and
quite
broken
in
spirit
sat
down
on
a
bench
.
*NL*
She
fell
into
painful
thought
on
her
position
,
which
ended
with
her
*NL*
saying
quite
loud
,
``
O
,
I
wish
I
was
dead
with
dear
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
bench
was
a
little
promenade
under
the
wall
where
people
*NL*
sometimes
walked
instead
of
on
the
gravel
.
The
bench
seemed
to
be
*NL*
touched
by
something
,
she
looked
round
,
and
a
face
was
bending
over
her
,
*NL*
veiled
,
but
still
distinct
,
the
face
of
the
young
woman
she
had
seen
*NL*
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
looked
confounded
for
a
moment
,
knowing
she
had
been
*NL*
overheard
,
though
there
was
pleasure
in
her
confusion
.
``
Yes
,
I
heard
*NL*
you
,
''
said
the
lady
,
in
a
vivacious
voice
,
answering
her
look
.
``
What
can
*NL*
have
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
--
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
putting
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
face
to
hide
a
quick
flush
that
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
movement
or
word
for
a
few
seconds
;
then
the
girl
felt
that
*NL*
the
young
lady
was
sitting
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
how
it
is
with
you
,
''
said
the
latter
.
``
That
was
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
She
waved
her
hand
towards
the
tombstone
.
Elizabeth
looked
up
at
her
as
*NL*
if
inquiring
of
herself
whether
there
should
be
confidence
.
The
lady
's
*NL*
manner
was
so
desirous
,
so
anxious
,
that
the
girl
decided
there
should
*NL*
be
confidence
.
``
It
was
my
mother
,
''
she
said
,
``
my
only
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
father
,
Mr.
Henchard
.
He
is
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
living
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
not
kind
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
wish
to
complain
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
a
disagreement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
were
to
blame
,
''
suggested
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
--
in
many
ways
,
''
sighed
the
meek
Elizabeth
.
``
I
swept
up
the
coals
*NL*
when
the
servants
ought
to
have
done
it
;
and
I
said
I
was
leery
;
--
and
he
*NL*
was
angry
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
seemed
to
warm
towards
her
for
that
reply
.
``
Do
you
know
the
*NL*
impression
your
words
give
me
?
''
she
said
ingenuously
.
``
That
he
is
a
*NL*
hot-tempered
man
--
a
little
proud
--
perhaps
ambitious
;
but
not
a
bad
man
.
''
*NL*
Her
anxiety
not
to
condemn
Henchard
while
siding
with
Elizabeth
was
*NL*
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
;
certainly
not
BAD
,
''
agreed
the
honest
girl
.
``
And
he
has
not
even
*NL*
been
unkind
to
me
till
lately
--
since
mother
died
.
But
it
has
been
very
*NL*
much
to
bear
while
it
has
lasted
.
All
is
owing
to
my
defects
,
I
daresay
;
*NL*
and
my
defects
are
owing
to
my
history
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
history
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
looked
wistfully
at
her
questioner
.
She
found
that
her
*NL*
questioner
was
looking
at
her
,
turned
her
eyes
down
;
and
then
seemed
*NL*
compelled
to
look
back
again
.
``
My
history
is
not
gay
or
attractive
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
And
yet
I
can
tell
it
,
if
you
really
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
assured
her
that
she
did
want
to
know
;
whereupon
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
told
the
tale
of
her
life
as
she
understood
it
,
which
was
in
general
the
*NL*
true
one
,
except
that
the
sale
at
the
fair
had
no
part
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contrary
to
the
girl
's
expectation
her
new
friend
was
not
shocked
.
This
*NL*
cheered
her
;
and
it
was
not
till
she
thought
of
returning
to
that
home
*NL*
in
which
she
had
been
treated
so
roughly
of
late
that
her
spirits
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
return
,
''
she
murmured
.
``
I
think
of
going
away
.
But
*NL*
what
can
I
do
?
Where
can
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
will
be
better
soon
,
''
said
her
friend
gently
.
``
So
I
would
*NL*
not
go
far
.
Now
what
do
you
think
of
this
:
I
shall
soon
want
somebody
to
*NL*
live
in
my
house
,
partly
as
housekeeper
,
partly
as
companion
;
would
you
*NL*
mind
coming
to
me
?
But
perhaps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
``
I
would
,
indeed
--
I
*NL*
would
do
anything
to
be
independent
;
for
then
perhaps
my
father
might
*NL*
get
to
love
me
.
But
,
ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
accomplished
person
.
And
a
companion
to
you
must
be
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
not
necessarily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
?
But
I
ca
n't
help
using
rural
words
sometimes
,
when
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
I
shall
like
to
know
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
O
,
I
know
I
sha
n't
do
!
''
--
she
cried
with
a
distressful
laugh
.
``
I
*NL*
accidentally
learned
to
write
round
hand
instead
of
ladies

-
hand
.
And
,
*NL*
of
course
,
you
want
some
one
who
can
write
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
not
necessary
to
write
ladies

cried
the
joyous
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
do
you
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Casterbridge
,
or
rather
I
shall
be
living
here
after
twelve
o'clock
*NL*
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
expressed
her
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
staying
at
Budmouth
for
a
few
days
while
my
house
*NL*
was
getting
ready
.
The
house
I
am
going
into
is
that
one
they
call
*NL*
High-Place
Hall
--
the
old
stone
one
looking
down
the
lane
to
the
market
.
*NL*
Two
or
three
rooms
are
fit
for
occupation
,
though
not
all
:
I
sleep
there
*NL*
to-night
for
the
first
time
.
Now
will
you
think
over
my
proposal
,
and
*NL*
meet
me
here
the
first
fine
day
next
week
,
and
say
if
you
are
still
in
*NL*
the
same
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
her
eyes
shining
at
this
prospect
of
a
change
from
an
*NL*
unbearable
position
,
joyfully
assented
;
and
the
two
parted
at
the
gate
*NL*
of
the
churchyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
21
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
maxim
glibly
repeated
from
childhood
remains
practically
unmarked
*NL*
till
some
mature
experience
enforces
it
,
so
did
this
High-Place
Hall
now
*NL*
for
the
first
time
really
show
itself
to
Elizabeth-Jane
,
though
her
ears
*NL*
had
heard
its
name
on
a
hundred
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mind
dwelt
upon
nothing
else
but
the
stranger
,
and
the
house
,
*NL*
and
her
own
chance
of
living
there
,
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
In
the
*NL*
afternoon
she
had
occasion
to
pay
a
few
bills
in
the
town
and
do
a
*NL*
little
shopping
when
she
learnt
that
what
was
a
new
discovery
to
*NL*
herself
had
become
a
common
topic
about
the
streets
.
High-Place
Hall
*NL*
was
undergoing
repair
;
a
lady
was
coming
there
to
live
shortly
;
all
the
*NL*
shop-people
knew
it
,
and
had
already
discounted
the
chance
of
her
being
*NL*
a
customer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
could
,
however
,
add
a
capping
touch
to
information
so
new
*NL*
to
her
in
the
bulk
.
The
lady
,
she
said
,
had
arrived
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
lamps
were
lighted
,
and
it
was
yet
not
so
dark
as
to
render
*NL*
chimneys
,
attics
,
and
roofs
invisible
,
Elizabeth
,
almost
with
a
lover
's
*NL*
feeling
,
thought
she
would
like
to
look
at
the
outside
of
High-Place
*NL*
Hall
.
She
went
up
the
street
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hall
,
with
its
grey
facade
and
parapet
,
was
the
only
residence
of
*NL*
its
sort
so
near
the
centre
of
the
town
.
It
had
,
in
the
first
place
,
the
*NL*
characteristics
of
a
country
mansion
--
birds
'
nests
in
its
chimneys
,
*NL*
damp
nooks
where
fungi
grew
and
irregularities
of
surface
direct
from
*NL*
Nature
's
trowel
.
At
night
the
forms
of
passengers
were
patterned
by
the
*NL*
lamps
in
black
shadows
upon
the
pale
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
motes
of
straw
lay
around
,
and
other
signs
of
the
premises
*NL*
having
been
in
that
lawless
condition
which
accompanies
the
entry
of
a
*NL*
new
tenant
.
The
house
was
entirely
of
stone
,
and
formed
an
example
of
*NL*
dignity
without
great
size
.
It
was
not
altogether
aristocratic
,
still
*NL*
less
consequential
,
yet
the
old-fashioned
stranger
instinctively
said
*NL*
``
Blood
built
it
,
and
Wealth
enjoys
it
''
however
vague
his
opinions
of
*NL*
those
accessories
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
as
regards
the
enjoying
it
the
stranger
would
have
been
wrong
,
for
*NL*
until
this
very
evening
,
when
the
new
lady
had
arrived
,
the
house
had
*NL*
been
empty
for
a
year
or
two
while
before
that
interval
its
occupancy
*NL*
had
been
irregular
.
The
reason
of
its
unpopularity
was
soon
made
*NL*
manifest
.
Some
of
its
rooms
overlooked
the
market-place
;
and
such
a
*NL*
prospect
from
such
a
house
was
not
considered
desirable
or
seemly
by
its
*NL*
would-be
occupiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
eyes
sought
the
upper
rooms
,
and
saw
lights
there
.
The
lady
*NL*
had
obviously
arrived
.
The
impression
that
this
woman
of
comparatively
*NL*
practised
manner
had
made
upon
the
studious
girl
's
mind
was
so
deep
that
*NL*
she
enjoyed
standing
under
an
opposite
archway
merely
to
think
that
the
*NL*
charming
lady
was
inside
the
confronting
walls
,
and
to
wonder
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
.
Her
admiration
for
the
architecture
of
that
front
was
*NL*
entirely
on
account
of
the
inmate
it
screened
.
Though
for
that
matter
*NL*
the
architecture
deserved
admiration
,
or
at
least
study
,
on
its
own
*NL*
account
.
It
was
Palladian
,
and
like
most
architecture
erected
since
*NL*
the
Gothic
age
was
a
compilation
rather
than
a
design
.
But
its
*NL*
reasonableness
made
it
impressive
.
It
was
not
rich
,
but
rich
enough
.
A
*NL*
timely
consciousness
of
the
ultimate
vanity
of
human
architecture
,
no
*NL*
less
than
of
other
human
things
,
had
prevented
artistic
superfluity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
had
still
quite
recently
been
going
in
and
out
with
parcels
*NL*
and
packing-cases
,
rendering
the
door
and
hall
within
like
a
public
*NL*
thoroughfare
.
Elizabeth
trotted
through
the
open
door
in
the
dusk
,
*NL*
but
becoming
alarmed
at
her
own
temerity
she
went
quickly
out
again
by
*NL*
another
which
stood
open
in
the
lofty
wall
of
the
back
court
.
To
her
*NL*
surprise
she
found
herself
in
one
of
the
little-used
alleys
of
the
town
.
*NL*
Looking
round
at
the
door
which
had
given
her
egress
,
by
the
light
of
*NL*
the
solitary
lamp
fixed
in
the
alley
,
she
saw
that
it
was
arched
and
*NL*
old
--
older
even
than
the
house
itself
.
The
door
was
studded
,
and
the
*NL*
keystone
of
the
arch
was
a
mask
.
Originally
the
mask
had
exhibited
a
*NL*
comic
leer
,
as
could
still
be
discerned
;
but
generations
of
Casterbridge
*NL*
boys
had
thrown
stones
at
the
mask
,
aiming
at
its
open
mouth
;
and
the
*NL*
blows
thereon
had
chipped
off
the
lips
and
jaws
as
if
they
had
been
*NL*
eaten
away
by
disease
.
The
appearance
was
so
ghastly
by
the
weakly
*NL*
lamp-glimmer
that
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
--
the
first
unpleasant
*NL*
feature
of
her
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
of
the
queer
old
door
and
the
odd
presence
of
the
leering
*NL*
mask
suggested
one
thing
above
all
others
as
appertaining
to
the
*NL*
mansion
's
past
history
--
intrigue
.
By
the
alley
it
had
been
possible
to
*NL*
come
unseen
from
all
sorts
of
quarters
in
the
town
--
the
old
play-house
,
*NL*
the
old
bull-stake
,
the
old
cock-pit
,
the
pool
wherein
nameless
*NL*
infants
had
been
used
to
disappear
.
High-Place
Hall
could
boast
of
its
*NL*
conveniences
undoubtedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
come
away
in
the
nearest
direction
homeward
,
which
was
*NL*
down
the
alley
,
but
hearing
footsteps
approaching
in
that
quarter
,
and
*NL*
having
no
great
wish
to
be
found
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
she
*NL*
quickly
retreated
.
There
being
no
other
way
out
she
stood
behind
a
brick
*NL*
pier
till
the
intruder
should
have
gone
his
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
she
watched
she
would
have
been
surprised
.
She
would
have
seen
that
*NL*
the
pedestrian
on
coming
up
made
straight
for
the
arched
doorway
:
that
*NL*
as
he
paused
with
his
hand
upon
the
latch
the
lamplight
fell
upon
the
*NL*
face
of
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elizabeth-Jane
clung
so
closely
to
her
nook
that
she
discerned
*NL*
nothing
of
this
.
Henchard
passed
in
,
as
ignorant
of
her
presence
as
she
*NL*
was
ignorant
of
his
identity
,
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
came
out
a
second
time
into
the
alley
,
and
made
the
best
of
her
way
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
chiding
,
by
begetting
in
her
a
nervous
fear
of
doing
anything
*NL*
definable
as
unladylike
,
had
operated
thus
curiously
in
keeping
them
*NL*
unknown
to
each
other
at
a
critical
moment
.
Much
might
have
resulted
*NL*
from
recognition
--
at
the
least
a
query
on
either
side
in
one
and
the
*NL*
selfsame
form
:
What
could
he
or
she
possibly
be
doing
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
,
whatever
his
business
at
the
lady
's
house
,
reached
his
own
*NL*
home
only
a
few
minutes
later
than
Elizabeth-Jane
.
Her
plan
was
to
*NL*
broach
the
question
of
leaving
his
roof
this
evening
;
the
events
of
the
*NL*
day
had
urged
her
to
the
course
.
But
its
execution
depended
upon
his
*NL*
mood
,
and
she
anxiously
awaited
his
manner
towards
her
.
She
found
that
*NL*
it
had
changed
.
He
showed
no
further
tendency
to
be
angry
;
he
*NL*
showed
something
worse
.
Absolute
indifference
had
taken
the
place
*NL*
of
irritability
;
and
his
coldness
was
such
that
it
encouraged
her
to
*NL*
departure
,
even
more
than
hot
temper
could
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
have
you
any
objection
to
my
going
away
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
away
!
No
--
none
whatever
.
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
it
undesirable
and
unnecessary
to
say
anything
at
present
*NL*
about
her
destination
to
one
who
took
so
little
interest
in
her
.
He
*NL*
would
know
that
soon
enough
.
``
I
have
heard
of
an
opportunity
of
getting
*NL*
more
cultivated
and
finished
,
and
being
less
idle
,
''
she
answered
,
*NL*
with
hesitation
.
``
A
chance
of
a
place
in
a
household
where
I
can
have
*NL*
advantages
of
study
,
and
seeing
refined
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
make
the
best
of
it
,
in
Heaven
's
name
--
if
you
ca
n't
get
cultivated
*NL*
where
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
object
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Object
--
I
?
Ho
--
no
!
Not
at
all
.
''
After
a
pause
he
said
,
``
But
you
wo
n't
*NL*
have
enough
money
for
this
lively
scheme
without
help
,
you
know
?
If
you
*NL*
like
I
should
be
willing
to
make
you
an
allowance
,
so
that
you
not
be
*NL*
bound
to
live
upon
the
starvation
wages
refined
folk
are
likely
to
pay
*NL*
`
ee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thanked
him
for
this
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
had
better
be
done
properly
,
''
he
added
after
a
pause
.
``
A
small
*NL*
annuity
is
what
I
should
like
you
to
have
--
so
as
to
be
independent
of
*NL*
me
--
and
so
that
I
may
be
independent
of
you
.
Would
that
please
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
see
about
it
this
very
day
.
''
He
seemed
relieved
to
get
her
*NL*
off
his
hands
by
this
arrangement
,
and
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
the
*NL*
matter
was
settled
.
She
now
simply
waited
to
see
the
lady
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
and
the
hour
came
;
but
a
drizzling
rain
fell
.
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
having
now
changed
her
orbit
from
one
of
gay
independence
to
laborious
*NL*
self-help
,
thought
the
weather
good
enough
for
such
declined
glory
as
*NL*
hers
,
if
her
friend
would
only
face
it
--
a
matter
of
doubt
.
She
went
to
*NL*
the
boot-room
where
her
pattens
had
hung
ever
since
her
apotheosis
;
took
*NL*
them
down
,
had
their
mildewed
leathers
blacked
,
and
put
them
on
as
she
*NL*
had
done
in
old
times
.
Thus
mounted
,
and
with
cloak
and
umbrella
,
she
*NL*
went
off
to
the
place
of
appointment
--
intending
,
if
the
lady
were
not
*NL*
there
,
to
call
at
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
side
of
the
churchyard
--
the
side
towards
the
weather
--
was
sheltered
*NL*
by
an
ancient
thatched
mud
wall
whose
eaves
overhung
as
much
as
one
or
*NL*
two
feet
.
At
the
back
of
the
wall
was
a
corn-yard
with
its
granary
and
*NL*
barns
--
the
place
wherein
she
had
met
Farfrae
many
months
earlier
.
Under
*NL*
the
projection
of
the
thatch
she
saw
a
figure
.
The
young
lady
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
presence
so
exceptionally
substantiated
the
girl
's
utmost
hopes
that
*NL*
she
almost
feared
her
good
fortune
.
Fancies
find
rooms
in
the
strongest
*NL*
minds
.
Here
,
in
a
churchyard
old
as
civilization
,
in
the
worst
of
*NL*
weathers
,
was
a
strange
woman
of
curious
fascinations
never
seen
*NL*
elsewhere
:
there
might
be
some
devilry
about
her
presence
.
However
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
went
on
to
the
church
tower
,
on
whose
summit
the
rope
of
a
*NL*
flagstaff
rattled
in
the
wind
;
and
thus
she
came
to
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
had
such
a
cheerful
aspect
in
the
drizzle
that
Elizabeth
forgot
*NL*
her
fancy
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
lady
,
a
little
of
the
whiteness
of
her
teeth
*NL*
appearing
with
the
word
through
the
black
fleece
that
protected
her
*NL*
face
,
``
have
you
decided
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
,
''
said
the
other
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
is
willing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
--
as
soon
as
you
like
.
I
had
a
good
mind
to
send
to
you
to
come
to
*NL*
my
house
,
thinking
you
might
not
venture
up
here
in
the
wind
.
But
as
I
*NL*
like
getting
out
of
doors
,
I
thought
I
would
come
and
see
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
own
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shows
we
shall
agree
.
Then
can
you
come
to-day
?
My
house
is
so
*NL*
hollow
and
dismal
that
I
want
some
living
thing
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
might
be
able
to
,
''
said
the
girl
,
reflecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Voices
were
borne
over
to
them
at
that
instant
on
the
wind
and
raindrops
*NL*
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
.
There
came
such
words
as
``
sacks
,
''
*NL*
``
quarters
,
''
``
threshing
,
''
``
tailing
,
''
``
next
Saturday
's
market
,
''
each
*NL*
sentence
being
disorganized
by
the
gusts
like
a
face
in
a
cracked
*NL*
mirror
.
Both
the
women
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
those
?
''
said
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
is
my
father
.
He
rents
that
yard
and
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
seemed
to
forget
the
immediate
business
in
listening
to
the
*NL*
technicalities
of
the
corn
trade
.
At
last
she
said
suddenly
,
``
Did
you
*NL*
tell
him
where
you
were
going
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
--
how
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
safer
to
get
away
first
--
as
he
is
so
uncertain
in
his
*NL*
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
right
...
Besides
,
I
have
never
told
you
my
name
.
It
is
*NL*
Miss
Templeman
...
Are
they
gone
--
on
the
other
side
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
They
have
only
gone
up
into
the
granary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
getting
damp
here
.
I
shall
expect
you
to-day
--
this
evening
,
*NL*
say
,
at
six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
shall
I
come
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
front
way
--
round
by
the
gate
.
There
is
no
other
that
I
have
*NL*
noticed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
been
thinking
of
the
door
in
the
alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
as
you
have
not
mentioned
your
destination
,
you
may
as
well
*NL*
keep
silent
upon
it
till
you
are
clear
off
.
Who
knows
but
that
he
may
*NL*
alter
his
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
shook
her
head
.
``
On
consideration
I
do
n't
fear
it
,
''
she
*NL*
said
sadly
.
``
He
has
grown
quite
cold
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Six
o'clock
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
emerged
upon
the
open
road
and
parted
,
they
found
enough
*NL*
to
do
in
holding
their
bowed
umbrellas
to
the
wind
.
Nevertheless
the
*NL*
lady
looked
in
at
the
corn-yard
gates
as
she
passed
them
,
and
paused
on
*NL*
one
foot
for
a
moment
.
But
nothing
was
visible
there
save
the
ricks
,
and
*NL*
the
humpbacked
barn
cushioned
with
moss
,
and
the
granary
rising
against
*NL*
the
church-tower
behind
,
where
the
smacking
of
the
rope
against
the
*NL*
flag-staff
still
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Henchard
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
that
Elizabeth-Jane
's
*NL*
movement
was
to
be
so
prompt
.
Hence
when
,
just
before
six
,
he
*NL*
reached
home
and
saw
a
fly
at
the
door
from
the
King
's
Arms
,
and
his
*NL*
step-daughter
,
with
all
her
little
bags
and
boxes
,
getting
into
it
,
he
*NL*
was
taken
by
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
I
might
go
,
father
?
''
she
explained
through
the
carriage
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
!
--
yes
.
But
I
thought
you
meant
next
month
,
or
next
year
.
`
Od
,
*NL*
seize
it
--
you
take
time
by
the
forelock
!
This
,
then
,
is
how
you
be
going
*NL*
to
treat
me
for
all
my
trouble
about
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
father
!
how
can
you
speak
like
that
?
It
is
unjust
of
you
!
''
she
said
*NL*
with
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
have
your
own
way
,
''
he
replied
.
He
entered
the
house
,
and
,
*NL*
seeing
that
all
her
things
had
not
yet
been
brought
down
,
went
up
to
*NL*
her
room
to
look
on
.
He
had
never
been
there
since
she
had
occupied
it
.
*NL*
Evidences
of
her
care
,
of
her
endeavours
for
improvement
,
were
*NL*
visible
all
around
,
in
the
form
of
books
,
sketches
,
maps
,
and
little
*NL*
arrangements
for
tasteful
effects
.
Henchard
had
known
nothing
of
these
*NL*
efforts
.
He
gazed
at
them
,
turned
suddenly
about
,
and
came
down
to
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
he
said
,
in
an
altered
voice
--
he
never
called
her
by
*NL*
name
now
--
``
do
n't
`
ee
go
away
from
me
.
It
may
be
I
've
spoke
roughly
to
*NL*
you
--
but
I
've
been
grieved
beyond
everything
by
you
--
there
's
something
*NL*
that
caused
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
me
?
''
she
said
,
with
deep
concern
.
``
What
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
now
.
But
if
you
'll
stop
,
and
go
on
living
as
my
*NL*
daughter
,
I
'll
tell
you
all
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
proposal
had
come
ten
minutes
too
late
.
She
was
in
the
fly
--
was
*NL*
already
,
in
imagination
,
at
the
house
of
the
lady
whose
manner
had
such
*NL*
charms
for
her
.
``
Father
,
''
she
said
,
as
considerately
as
she
could
,
``
I
*NL*
think
it
best
for
us
that
I
go
on
now
.
I
need
not
stay
long
;
I
shall
not
*NL*
be
far
away
,
and
if
you
want
me
badly
I
can
soon
come
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
ever
so
slightly
,
as
a
receipt
of
her
decision
and
no
more
.
*NL*
``
You
are
not
going
far
,
you
say
.
What
will
be
your
address
,
in
case
I
*NL*
wish
to
write
to
you
?
Or
am
I
not
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
certainly
.
It
is
only
in
the
town
--
High-Place
Hall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
said
Henchard
,
his
face
stilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
the
words
.
He
neither
moved
nor
spoke
,
and
waving
her
hand
*NL*
to
him
in
utmost
friendliness
she
signified
to
the
flyman
to
drive
up
*NL*
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
22
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
preceding
night
,
to
account
for
*NL*
Henchard
's
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
when
Elizabeth-Jane
was
contemplating
her
stealthy
*NL*
reconnoitring
excursion
to
the
abode
of
the
lady
of
her
fancy
,
he
had
*NL*
been
not
a
little
amazed
at
receiving
a
letter
by
hand
in
Lucetta
's
*NL*
well-known
characters
.
The
self-repression
,
the
resignation
of
her
*NL*
previous
communication
had
vanished
from
her
mood
;
she
wrote
with
*NL*
some
of
the
natural
lightness
which
had
marked
her
in
their
early
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HIGH-PLACE
HALL
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
MR.
HENCHARD
,
--
Do
n't
be
surprised
.
It
is
for
your
good
and
mine
,
*NL*
as
I
hope
,
that
I
have
come
to
live
at
Casterbridge
--
for
how
long
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
.
That
depends
upon
another
;
and
he
is
a
man
,
and
a
merchant
,
*NL*
and
a
Mayor
,
and
one
who
has
the
first
right
to
my
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seriously
,
mon
ami
,
I
am
not
so
light-hearted
as
I
may
seem
to
be
from
*NL*
this
.
I
have
come
here
in
consequence
of
hearing
of
the
death
of
your
*NL*
wife
--
whom
you
used
to
think
of
as
dead
so
many
years
before
!
Poor
*NL*
woman
,
she
seems
to
have
been
a
sufferer
,
though
uncomplaining
,
and
*NL*
though
weak
in
intellect
not
an
imbecile
.
I
am
glad
you
acted
fairly
by
*NL*
her
.
As
soon
as
I
knew
she
was
no
more
,
it
was
brought
home
to
me
very
*NL*
forcibly
by
my
conscience
that
I
ought
to
endeavour
to
disperse
the
*NL*
shade
which
my
etourderie
flung
over
my
name
,
by
asking
you
to
carry
out
*NL*
your
promise
to
me
.
I
hope
you
are
of
the
same
mind
,
and
that
you
*NL*
will
take
steps
to
this
end
.
As
,
however
,
I
did
not
know
how
you
were
*NL*
situated
,
or
what
had
happened
since
our
separation
,
I
decided
to
come
*NL*
and
establish
myself
here
before
communicating
with
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
probably
feel
as
I
do
about
this
.
I
shall
be
able
to
see
you
in
a
*NL*
day
or
two
.
Till
then
,
farewell
.
--
Yours
,
*NL*
*NL*
LUCETTA
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.S.
--
I
was
unable
to
keep
my
appointment
to
meet
you
for
a
moment
or
*NL*
two
in
passing
through
Casterbridge
the
other
day
.
My
plans
were
altered
*NL*
by
a
family
event
,
which
it
will
surprise
you
to
hear
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
had
already
heard
that
High-Place
Hall
was
being
prepared
for
*NL*
a
tenant
.
He
said
with
a
puzzled
air
to
the
first
person
he
encountered
,
*NL*
``
Who
is
coming
to
live
at
the
Hall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lady
of
the
name
of
Templeman
,
I
believe
,
sir
,
''
said
his
informant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
thought
it
over
.
``
Lucetta
is
related
to
her
,
I
suppose
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Yes
,
I
must
put
her
in
her
proper
position
,
*NL*
undoubtedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
no
means
with
the
oppression
that
would
once
have
accompanied
*NL*
the
thought
that
he
regarded
the
moral
necessity
now
;
it
was
,
indeed
,
*NL*
with
interest
,
if
not
warmth
.
His
bitter
disappointment
at
finding
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
to
be
none
of
his
,
and
himself
a
childless
man
,
had
left
*NL*
an
emotional
void
in
Henchard
that
he
unconsciously
craved
to
fill
.
In
*NL*
this
frame
of
mind
,
though
without
strong
feeling
,
he
had
strolled
up
*NL*
the
alley
and
into
High-Place
Hall
by
the
postern
at
which
Elizabeth
*NL*
had
so
nearly
encountered
him
.
He
had
gone
on
thence
into
the
court
,
and
*NL*
inquired
of
a
man
whom
he
saw
unpacking
china
from
a
crate
if
Miss
Le
*NL*
Sueur
was
living
there
.
Miss
Le
Sueur
had
been
the
name
under
which
he
*NL*
had
known
Lucetta
--
or
``
Lucette
,
''
as
she
had
called
herself
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
replied
in
the
negative
;
that
Miss
Templeman
only
had
come
.
*NL*
Henchard
went
away
,
concluding
that
Lucetta
had
not
as
yet
settled
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
this
interested
stage
of
the
inquiry
when
he
witnessed
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
's
departure
the
next
day
.
On
hearing
her
announce
the
*NL*
address
there
suddenly
took
possession
of
him
the
strange
thought
that
*NL*
Lucetta
and
Miss
Templeman
were
one
and
the
same
person
,
for
he
could
*NL*
recall
that
in
her
season
of
intimacy
with
him
the
name
of
the
rich
*NL*
relative
whom
he
had
deemed
somewhat
a
mythical
personage
had
been
given
*NL*
as
Templeman
.
Though
he
was
not
a
fortune-hunter
,
the
possibility
*NL*
that
Lucetta
had
been
sublimed
into
a
lady
of
means
by
some
munificent
*NL*
testament
on
the
part
of
this
relative
lent
a
charm
to
her
image
which
*NL*
it
might
not
otherwise
have
acquired
.
He
was
getting
on
towards
the
dead
*NL*
level
of
middle
age
,
when
material
things
increasingly
possess
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Henchard
was
not
left
long
in
suspense
.
Lucetta
was
rather
addicted
*NL*
to
scribbling
,
as
had
been
shown
by
the
torrent
of
letters
after
the
*NL*
fiasco
in
their
marriage
arrangements
,
and
hardly
had
Elizabeth
gone
*NL*
away
when
another
note
came
to
the
Mayor
's
house
from
High-Place
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
residence
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
comfortable
,
though
getting
here
has
*NL*
been
a
wearisome
undertaking
.
You
probably
know
what
I
am
going
to
tell
*NL*
you
,
or
do
you
not
?
My
good
Aunt
Templeman
,
the
banker
's
widow
,
whose
*NL*
very
existence
you
used
to
doubt
,
much
more
her
affluence
,
has
lately
*NL*
died
,
and
bequeathed
some
of
her
property
to
me
.
I
will
not
enter
into
*NL*
details
except
to
say
that
I
have
taken
her
name
--
as
a
means
of
escape
*NL*
from
mine
,
and
its
wrongs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
now
my
own
mistress
,
and
have
chosen
to
reside
in
Casterbridge
--
to
*NL*
be
tenant
of
High-Place
Hall
,
that
at
least
you
may
be
put
to
no
trouble
*NL*
if
you
wish
to
see
me
.
My
first
intention
was
to
keep
you
in
ignorance
*NL*
of
the
changes
in
my
life
till
you
should
meet
me
in
the
street
;
but
I
*NL*
have
thought
better
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
probably
are
aware
of
my
arrangement
with
your
daughter
,
and
have
*NL*
doubtless
laughed
at
the
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
--
practical
joke
-LRB-
in
all
*NL*
affection
-RRB-
of
my
getting
her
to
live
with
me
.
But
my
first
meeting
with
*NL*
her
was
purely
an
accident
.
Do
you
see
,
Michael
,
partly
why
I
have
done
*NL*
it
?
--
why
,
to
give
you
an
excuse
for
coming
here
as
if
to
visit
HER
,
and
*NL*
thus
to
form
my
acquaintance
naturally
.
She
is
a
dear
,
good
girl
,
and
*NL*
she
thinks
you
have
treated
her
with
undue
severity
.
You
may
have
done
*NL*
so
in
your
haste
,
but
not
deliberately
,
I
am
sure
.
As
the
result
has
*NL*
been
to
bring
her
to
me
I
am
not
disposed
to
upbraid
you
.
--
In
haste
,
*NL*
yours
always
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
LUCETTA
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
excitement
which
these
announcements
produced
in
Henchard
's
gloomy
*NL*
soul
was
to
him
most
pleasurable
.
He
sat
over
his
dining-table
long
and
*NL*
dreamily
,
and
by
an
almost
mechanical
transfer
the
sentiments
which
*NL*
had
run
to
waste
since
his
estrangement
from
Elizabeth-Jane
and
Donald
*NL*
Farfrae
gathered
around
Lucetta
before
they
had
grown
dry
.
She
was
*NL*
plainly
in
a
very
coming-on
disposition
for
marriage
.
But
what
else
*NL*
could
a
poor
woman
be
who
had
given
her
time
and
her
heart
to
him
*NL*
so
thoughtlessly
,
at
that
former
time
,
as
to
lose
her
credit
by
it
?
*NL*
Probably
conscience
no
less
than
affection
had
brought
her
here
.
On
the
*NL*
whole
he
did
not
blame
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
artful
little
woman
!
''
he
said
,
smiling
-LRB-
with
reference
to
Lucetta
's
*NL*
adroit
and
pleasant
manoeuvre
with
Elizabeth-Jane
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
feel
that
he
would
like
to
see
Lucetta
was
with
Henchard
to
start
*NL*
for
her
house
.
He
put
on
his
hat
and
went
.
It
was
between
eight
and
nine
*NL*
o'clock
when
he
reached
her
door
.
The
answer
brought
him
was
that
Miss
*NL*
Templeman
was
engaged
for
that
evening
;
but
that
she
would
be
happy
to
*NL*
see
him
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
rather
like
giving
herself
airs
!
''
he
thought
.
``
And
considering
*NL*
what
we
--
''
But
after
all
,
she
plainly
had
not
expected
him
,
and
he
took
*NL*
the
refusal
quietly
.
Nevertheless
he
resolved
not
to
go
next
day
.
``
These
*NL*
cursed
women
--
there
's
not
an
inch
of
straight
grain
in
'em
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
follow
the
train
of
Mr.
Henchard
's
thought
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
clue
line
,
and
view
the
interior
of
High-Place
Hall
on
this
particular
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Elizabeth-Jane
's
arrival
she
had
been
phlegmatically
asked
by
an
*NL*
elderly
woman
to
go
upstairs
and
take
off
her
things
.
She
replied
with
*NL*
great
earnestness
that
she
would
not
think
of
giving
that
trouble
,
and
*NL*
on
the
instant
divested
herself
of
her
bonnet
and
cloak
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
She
was
then
conducted
to
the
first
floor
on
the
landing
,
and
left
to
*NL*
find
her
way
further
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
disclosed
was
prettily
furnished
as
a
boudoir
or
small
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
on
a
sofa
with
two
cylindrical
pillows
reclined
a
*NL*
dark-haired
,
large-eyed
,
pretty
woman
,
of
unmistakably
French
extraction
*NL*
on
one
side
or
the
other
.
She
was
probably
some
years
older
than
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
and
had
a
sparkling
light
in
her
eye
.
In
front
of
the
sofa
*NL*
was
a
small
table
,
with
a
pack
of
cards
scattered
upon
it
faces
upward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attitude
had
been
so
full
of
abandonment
that
she
bounded
up
like
a
*NL*
spring
on
hearing
the
door
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
that
it
was
Elizabeth
she
lapsed
into
ease
,
and
came
across
*NL*
to
her
with
a
reckless
skip
that
innate
grace
only
prevented
from
being
*NL*
boisterous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
are
late
,
''
she
said
,
taking
hold
of
Elizabeth-Jane
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
so
many
little
things
to
put
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
seem
dead-alive
and
tired
.
Let
me
try
to
enliven
you
by
some
*NL*
wonderful
tricks
I
have
learnt
,
to
kill
time
.
Sit
there
and
do
n't
move
.
''
*NL*
She
gathered
up
the
pack
of
cards
,
pulled
the
table
in
front
of
her
,
and
*NL*
began
to
deal
them
rapidly
,
telling
Elizabeth
to
choose
some
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
chosen
?
''
she
asked
flinging
down
the
last
card
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
stammered
Elizabeth
,
arousing
herself
from
a
reverie
.
``
I
forgot
,
I
*NL*
was
thinking
of
--
you
,
and
me
--
and
how
strange
it
is
that
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Templeman
looked
at
Elizabeth-Jane
with
interest
,
and
laid
down
the
*NL*
cards
.
``
Ah
!
never
mind
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
lie
here
while
you
sit
by
me
;
*NL*
and
we
'll
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
drew
up
silently
to
the
head
of
the
sofa
,
but
with
obvious
*NL*
pleasure
.
It
could
be
seen
that
though
in
years
she
was
younger
than
her
*NL*
entertainer
in
manner
and
general
vision
she
seemed
more
of
the
sage
.
*NL*
Miss
Templeman
deposited
herself
on
the
sofa
in
her
former
flexuous
*NL*
position
,
and
throwing
her
arm
above
her
brow
--
somewhat
in
the
pose
of
*NL*
a
well-known
conception
of
Titian
's
--
talked
up
at
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
invertedly
across
her
forehead
and
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
something
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
wonder
if
you
have
suspected
*NL*
it
.
I
have
only
been
mistress
of
a
large
house
and
fortune
a
little
*NL*
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
only
a
little
while
?
''
murmured
Elizabeth-Jane
,
her
countenance
*NL*
slightly
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
girl
I
lived
about
in
garrison
towns
and
elsewhere
with
my
father
,
*NL*
till
I
was
quite
flighty
and
unsettled
.
He
was
an
officer
in
the
army
.
I
*NL*
should
not
have
mentioned
this
had
I
not
thought
it
best
you
should
know
*NL*
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
''
She
looked
thoughtfully
round
the
room
--
at
the
little
square
*NL*
piano
with
brass
inlayings
,
at
the
window-curtains
,
at
the
lamp
,
at
the
*NL*
fair
and
dark
kings
and
queens
on
the
card-table
,
and
finally
at
the
*NL*
inverted
face
of
Lucetta
Templeman
,
whose
large
lustrous
eyes
had
such
*NL*
an
odd
effect
upside
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
mind
ran
on
acquirements
to
an
almost
morbid
degree
.
``
You
*NL*
speak
French
and
Italian
fluently
,
no
doubt
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
not
been
*NL*
able
to
get
beyond
a
wretched
bit
of
Latin
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
that
matter
,
in
my
native
isle
speaking
French
does
not
go
*NL*
for
much
.
It
is
rather
the
other
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
your
native
isle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
rather
more
reluctance
that
Miss
Templeman
said
,
``
Jersey
.
*NL*
There
they
speak
French
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
English
on
the
*NL*
other
,
and
a
mixed
tongue
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
But
it
is
a
long
*NL*
time
since
I
was
there
.
Bath
is
where
my
people
really
belong
to
,
though
*NL*
my
ancestors
in
Jersey
were
as
good
as
anybody
in
England
.
They
were
*NL*
the
Le
Sueurs
,
an
old
family
who
have
done
great
things
in
their
time
.
*NL*
I
went
back
and
lived
there
after
my
father
's
death
.
But
I
do
n't
value
*NL*
such
past
matters
,
and
am
quite
an
English
person
in
my
feelings
and
*NL*
tastes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
's
tongue
had
for
a
moment
outrun
her
discretion
.
She
had
arrived
*NL*
at
Casterbridge
as
a
Bath
lady
,
and
there
were
obvious
reasons
why
*NL*
Jersey
should
drop
out
of
her
life
.
But
Elizabeth
had
tempted
her
to
*NL*
make
free
,
and
a
deliberately
formed
resolve
had
been
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
,
however
,
have
been
broken
in
safer
company
.
Lucetta
's
*NL*
words
went
no
further
,
and
after
this
day
she
was
so
much
upon
her
*NL*
guard
that
there
appeared
no
chance
of
her
identification
with
the
young
*NL*
Jersey
woman
who
had
been
Henchard
's
dear
comrade
at
a
critical
time
.
*NL*
Not
the
least
amusing
of
her
safeguards
was
her
resolute
avoidance
of
a
*NL*
French
word
if
one
by
accident
came
to
her
tongue
more
readily
than
*NL*
its
English
equivalent
.
She
shirked
it
with
the
suddenness
of
the
weak
*NL*
Apostle
at
the
accusation
,
``
Thy
speech
bewrayeth
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Expectancy
sat
visibly
upon
Lucetta
the
next
morning
.
She
dressed
*NL*
herself
for
Mr.
Henchard
,
and
restlessly
awaited
his
call
before
*NL*
mid-day
;
as
he
did
not
come
she
waited
on
through
the
afternoon
.
But
*NL*
she
did
not
tell
Elizabeth
that
the
person
expected
was
the
girl
's
*NL*
stepfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
in
adjoining
windows
of
the
same
room
in
Lucetta
's
great
stone
*NL*
mansion
,
netting
,
and
looking
out
upon
the
market
,
which
formed
an
*NL*
animated
scene
.
Elizabeth
could
see
the
crown
of
her
stepfather
's
hat
*NL*
among
the
rest
beneath
,
and
was
not
aware
that
Lucetta
watched
the
same
*NL*
object
with
yet
intenser
interest
.
He
moved
about
amid
the
throng
,
at
*NL*
this
point
lively
as
an
ant-hill
;
elsewhere
more
reposeful
,
and
broken
*NL*
up
by
stalls
of
fruit
and
vegetables
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmers
as
a
rule
preferred
the
open
carrefour
for
their
*NL*
transactions
,
despite
its
inconvenient
jostlings
and
the
danger
from
*NL*
crossing
vehicles
,
to
the
gloomy
sheltered
market-room
provided
for
*NL*
them
.
Here
they
surged
on
this
one
day
of
the
week
,
forming
a
little
*NL*
world
of
leggings
,
switches
,
and
sample-bags
;
men
of
extensive
stomachs
,
*NL*
sloping
like
mountain
sides
;
men
whose
heads
in
walking
swayed
as
the
*NL*
trees
in
November
gales
;
who
in
conversing
varied
their
attitudes
much
,
*NL*
lowering
themselves
by
spreading
their
knees
,
and
thrusting
their
hands
*NL*
into
the
pockets
of
remote
inner
jackets
.
Their
faces
radiated
tropical
*NL*
warmth
;
for
though
when
at
home
their
countenances
varied
with
the
*NL*
seasons
,
their
market-faces
all
the
year
round
were
glowing
little
*NL*
fires
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
over-clothes
here
were
worn
as
if
they
were
an
inconvenience
,
a
*NL*
hampering
necessity
.
Some
men
were
well
dressed
;
but
the
majority
were
*NL*
careless
in
that
respect
,
appearing
in
suits
which
were
historical
*NL*
records
of
their
wearer
's
deeds
,
sun-scorchings
,
and
daily
struggles
for
*NL*
many
years
past
.
Yet
many
carried
ruffled
cheque-books
in
their
pockets
*NL*
which
regulated
at
the
bank
hard
by
a
balance
of
never
less
than
four
*NL*
figures
.
In
fact
,
what
these
gibbous
human
shapes
specially
represented
*NL*
was
ready
money
--
money
insistently
ready
--
not
ready
next
year
like
*NL*
a
nobleman
's
--
often
not
merely
ready
at
the
bank
like
a
professional
*NL*
man
's
,
but
ready
in
their
large
plump
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
to-day
there
rose
in
the
midst
of
them
all
two
or
*NL*
three
tall
apple-trees
standing
as
if
they
grew
on
the
spot
;
till
it
was
*NL*
perceived
that
they
were
held
by
men
from
the
cider-districts
who
came
*NL*
here
to
sell
them
,
bringing
the
clay
of
their
county
on
their
boots
.
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
who
had
often
observed
them
,
said
,
``
I
wonder
if
the
same
*NL*
trees
come
every
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
trees
?
''
said
Lucetta
,
absorbed
in
watching
for
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
replied
vaguely
,
for
an
incident
checked
her
.
Behind
one
of
*NL*
the
trees
stood
Farfrae
,
briskly
discussing
a
sample-bag
with
a
farmer
.
*NL*
Henchard
had
come
up
,
accidentally
encountering
the
young
man
,
whose
*NL*
face
seemed
to
inquire
,
``
Do
we
speak
to
each
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
her
stepfather
throw
a
shine
into
his
eye
which
answered
``
No
!
''
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
particularly
interested
in
anybody
out
there
?
''
said
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
no
,
''
said
her
companion
,
a
quick
red
shooting
over
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luckily
Farfrae
's
figure
was
immediately
covered
by
the
apple-tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
looked
hard
at
her
.
``
Quite
sure
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Lucetta
looked
out
.
``
They
are
all
farmers
,
I
suppose
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
There
's
Mr.
Bulge
--
he
's
a
wine
merchant
;
there
's
Benjamin
*NL*
Brownlet
--
a
horse
dealer
;
and
Kitson
,
the
pig
breeder
;
and
Yopper
,
the
*NL*
auctioneer
;
besides
maltsters
,
and
millers
--
and
so
on
.
''
Farfrae
stood
*NL*
out
quite
distinctly
now
;
but
she
did
not
mention
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Saturday
afternoon
slipped
on
thus
desultorily
.
The
market
changed
*NL*
from
the
sample-showing
hour
to
the
idle
hour
before
starting
homewards
,
*NL*
when
tales
were
told
.
Henchard
had
not
called
on
Lucetta
though
he
had
*NL*
stood
so
near
.
He
must
have
been
too
busy
,
she
thought
.
He
would
come
on
*NL*
Sunday
or
Monday
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
came
but
not
the
visitor
,
though
Lucetta
repeated
her
dressing
*NL*
with
scrupulous
care
.
She
got
disheartened
.
It
may
at
once
be
declared
*NL*
that
Lucetta
no
longer
bore
towards
Henchard
all
that
warm
allegiance
*NL*
which
had
characterized
her
in
their
first
acquaintance
,
the
then
*NL*
unfortunate
issue
of
things
had
chilled
pure
love
considerably
.
But
*NL*
there
remained
a
conscientious
wish
to
bring
about
her
union
with
him
,
*NL*
now
that
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
it
--
to
right
her
position
--
which
*NL*
in
itself
was
a
happiness
to
sigh
for
.
With
strong
social
reasons
on
*NL*
her
side
why
their
marriage
should
take
place
there
had
ceased
to
be
*NL*
any
worldly
reason
on
his
why
it
should
be
postponed
,
since
she
had
*NL*
succeeded
to
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tuesday
was
the
great
Candlemas
fair
.
At
breakfast
she
said
to
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
quite
coolly
:
``
I
imagine
your
father
may
call
to
see
you
*NL*
to-day
.
I
suppose
he
stands
close
by
in
the
market-place
with
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
corn-dealers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
He
wo
n't
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
taken
against
me
,
''
she
said
in
a
husky
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
quarreled
more
deeply
than
I
know
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
wishing
to
shield
the
man
she
believed
to
be
her
father
from
*NL*
any
charge
of
unnatural
dislike
,
said
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
where
you
are
is
,
of
all
places
,
the
one
he
will
avoid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
nodded
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
looked
blank
,
twitched
up
her
lovely
eyebrows
and
lip
,
and
*NL*
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
.
Here
was
a
disaster
--
her
ingenious
scheme
*NL*
completely
stultified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
my
dear
Miss
Templeman
--
what
's
the
matter
?
''
cried
her
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
your
company
much
!
''
said
Lucetta
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
--
and
so
do
I
yours
!
''
Elizabeth
chimed
in
soothingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
''
She
could
not
finish
the
sentence
,
which
was
,
naturally
,
*NL*
that
if
Henchard
had
such
a
rooted
dislike
for
the
girl
as
now
seemed
to
*NL*
be
the
case
,
Elizabeth-Jane
would
have
to
be
got
rid
of
--
a
disagreeable
*NL*
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
provisional
resource
suggested
itself
.
``
Miss
Henchard
--
will
you
go
on
*NL*
an
errand
for
me
as
soon
as
breakfast
is
over
?
--
Ah
,
that
's
very
good
of
*NL*
you
.
Will
you
go
and
order
--
''
Here
she
enumerated
several
commissions
at
*NL*
sundry
shops
,
which
would
occupy
Elizabeth
's
time
for
the
next
hour
or
*NL*
two
,
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
ever
seen
the
Museum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
should
do
so
at
once
.
You
can
finish
the
morning
by
going
*NL*
there
.
It
is
an
old
house
in
a
back
street
--
I
forget
where
--
but
you
'll
*NL*
find
out
--
and
there
are
crowds
of
interesting
things
--
skeletons
,
teeth
,
*NL*
old
pots
and
pans
,
ancient
boots
and
shoes
,
birds
'
eggs
--
all
charmingly
*NL*
instructive
.
You
'll
be
sure
to
stay
till
you
get
quite
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
hastily
put
on
her
things
and
departed
.
``
I
wonder
why
she
*NL*
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
to-day
!
''
she
said
sorrowfully
as
she
went
.
That
*NL*
her
absence
,
rather
than
her
services
or
instruction
,
was
in
request
,
*NL*
had
been
readily
apparent
to
Elizabeth-Jane
,
simple
as
she
seemed
,
and
*NL*
difficult
as
it
was
to
attribute
a
motive
for
the
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
been
gone
ten
minutes
when
one
of
Lucetta
's
servants
was
*NL*
sent
to
Henchard
's
with
a
note
.
The
contents
were
briefly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
MICHAEL
,
--
You
will
be
standing
in
view
of
my
house
to-day
for
two
*NL*
or
three
hours
in
the
course
of
your
business
,
so
do
please
call
and
*NL*
see
me
.
I
am
sadly
disappointed
that
you
have
not
come
before
,
for
can
I
*NL*
help
anxiety
about
my
own
equivocal
relation
to
you
?
--
especially
now
*NL*
my
aunt
's
fortune
has
brought
me
more
prominently
before
society
?
Your
*NL*
daughter
's
presence
here
may
be
the
cause
of
your
neglect
;
and
I
have
*NL*
therefore
sent
her
away
for
the
morning
.
Say
you
come
on
business
--
I
*NL*
shall
be
quite
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
LUCETTA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
messenger
returned
her
mistress
gave
directions
that
if
a
*NL*
gentleman
called
he
was
to
be
admitted
at
once
,
and
sat
down
to
await
*NL*
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sentimentally
she
did
not
much
care
to
see
him
--
his
delays
had
wearied
*NL*
her
,
but
it
was
necessary
;
and
with
a
sigh
she
arranged
herself
*NL*
picturesquely
in
the
chair
;
first
this
way
,
then
that
;
next
so
that
the
*NL*
light
fell
over
her
head
.
Next
she
flung
herself
on
the
couch
in
the
*NL*
cyma-recta
curve
which
so
became
her
,
and
with
her
arm
over
her
brow
*NL*
looked
towards
the
door
.
This
,
she
decided
,
was
the
best
position
after
*NL*
all
,
and
thus
she
remained
till
a
man
's
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
Whereupon
Lucetta
,
forgetting
her
curve
-LRB-
for
Nature
was
too
strong
*NL*
for
Art
as
yet
-RRB-
,
jumped
up
and
ran
and
hid
herself
behind
one
of
the
*NL*
window-curtains
in
a
freak
of
timidity
.
In
spite
of
the
waning
of
*NL*
passion
the
situation
was
an
agitating
one
--
she
had
not
seen
Henchard
*NL*
since
his
-LRB-
supposed
-RRB-
temporary
parting
from
her
in
Jersey
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
hear
the
servant
showing
the
visitor
into
the
room
,
shutting
*NL*
the
door
upon
him
,
and
leaving
as
if
to
go
and
look
for
her
mistress
.
*NL*
Lucetta
flung
back
the
curtain
with
a
nervous
greeting
.
The
man
before
*NL*
her
was
not
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
23
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
conjecture
that
her
visitor
might
be
some
other
person
had
,
indeed
,
*NL*
flashed
through
Lucetta
's
mind
when
she
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
*NL*
out
;
but
it
was
just
too
late
to
recede
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
years
younger
than
the
Mayor
of
Casterbridge
;
fair
,
fresh
,
and
*NL*
slenderly
handsome
.
He
wore
genteel
cloth
leggings
with
white
buttons
,
*NL*
polished
boots
with
infinite
lace
holes
,
light
cord
breeches
under
a
*NL*
black
velveteen
coat
and
waistcoat
;
and
he
had
a
silver-topped
switch
in
*NL*
his
hand
.
Lucetta
blushed
,
and
said
with
a
curious
mixture
of
pout
and
*NL*
laugh
on
her
face
--
``
O
,
I
've
made
a
mistake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
,
on
the
contrary
,
did
not
laugh
half
a
wrinkle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
very
sorry
!
''
he
said
,
in
deprecating
tones
.
``
I
came
and
I
*NL*
inquired
for
Miss
Henchard
,
and
they
showed
me
up
here
,
and
in
no
case
*NL*
would
I
have
caught
ye
so
unmannerly
if
I
had
known
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
unmannerly
one
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
that
I
have
come
to
the
wrong
house
,
madam
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Farfrae
,
blinking
a
little
in
his
bewilderment
and
nervously
tapping
his
*NL*
legging
with
his
switch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
sir
,
--
sit
down
.
You
must
come
and
sit
down
now
you
are
here
,
''
*NL*
replied
Lucetta
kindly
,
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
.
``
Miss
Henchard
*NL*
will
be
here
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
was
not
strictly
true
;
but
that
something
about
the
young
*NL*
man
--
that
hyperborean
crispness
,
stringency
,
and
charm
,
as
of
a
*NL*
well-braced
musical
instrument
,
which
had
awakened
the
interest
of
*NL*
Henchard
,
and
of
Elizabeth-Jane
and
of
the
Three
Mariners
'
jovial
crew
,
*NL*
at
sight
,
made
his
unexpected
presence
here
attractive
to
Lucetta
.
*NL*
He
hesitated
,
looked
at
the
chair
,
thought
there
was
no
danger
in
it
*NL*
-LRB-
though
there
was
-RRB-
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
's
sudden
entry
was
simply
the
result
of
Henchard
's
permission
to
*NL*
him
to
see
Elizabeth
if
he
were
minded
to
woo
her
.
At
first
he
had
taken
*NL*
no
notice
of
Henchard
's
brusque
letter
;
but
an
exceptionally
fortunate
*NL*
business
transaction
put
him
on
good
terms
with
everybody
,
and
revealed
*NL*
to
him
that
he
could
undeniably
marry
if
he
chose
.
Then
who
so
pleasing
,
*NL*
thrifty
,
and
satisfactory
in
every
way
as
Elizabeth-Jane
?
Apart
from
*NL*
her
personal
recommendations
a
reconciliation
with
his
former
friend
*NL*
Henchard
would
,
in
the
natural
course
of
things
,
flow
from
such
a
union
.
*NL*
He
therefore
forgave
the
Mayor
his
curtness
;
and
this
morning
on
his
*NL*
way
to
the
fair
he
had
called
at
her
house
,
where
he
learnt
that
she
*NL*
was
staying
at
Miss
Templeman
's
.
A
little
stimulated
at
not
finding
her
*NL*
ready
and
waiting
--
so
fanciful
are
men
!
--
he
hastened
on
to
High-Place
*NL*
Hall
to
encounter
no
Elizabeth
but
its
mistress
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fair
to-day
seems
a
large
one
,
''
she
said
when
,
by
natural
*NL*
deviation
,
their
eyes
sought
the
busy
scene
without
.
``
Your
numerous
*NL*
fairs
and
markets
keep
me
interested
.
How
many
things
I
think
of
while
I
*NL*
watch
from
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
in
doubt
how
to
answer
,
and
the
babble
without
reached
them
*NL*
as
they
sat
--
voices
as
of
wavelets
on
a
looping
sea
,
one
ever
and
anon
*NL*
rising
above
the
rest
.
``
Do
you
look
out
often
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
very
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
look
for
any
one
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
she
have
answered
as
she
did
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
look
as
at
a
picture
merely
.
But
,
''
she
went
on
,
turning
pleasantly
to
*NL*
him
,
``
I
may
do
so
now
--
I
may
look
for
you
.
You
are
always
there
,
are
*NL*
you
not
?
Ah
--
I
do
n't
mean
it
seriously
!
But
it
is
amusing
to
look
for
*NL*
somebody
one
knows
in
a
crowd
,
even
if
one
does
not
want
him
.
It
takes
*NL*
off
the
terrible
oppressiveness
of
being
surrounded
by
a
throng
,
and
*NL*
having
no
point
of
junction
with
it
through
a
single
individual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
Maybe
you
'll
be
very
lonely
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
knows
how
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
rich
,
they
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
enjoy
my
riches
.
I
came
to
Casterbridge
*NL*
thinking
I
should
like
to
live
here
.
But
I
wonder
if
I
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
ye
come
from
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
neighbourhood
of
Bath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
from
near
Edinboro
'
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
It
's
better
to
stay
at
home
,
*NL*
and
that
's
true
;
but
a
man
must
live
where
his
money
is
made
.
It
is
a
*NL*
great
pity
,
but
it
's
always
so
!
Yet
I
've
done
very
well
this
year
.
O
*NL*
yes
,
''
he
went
on
with
ingenuous
enthusiasm
.
``
You
see
that
man
with
the
*NL*
drab
kerseymere
coat
?
I
bought
largely
of
him
in
the
autumn
when
wheat
*NL*
was
down
,
and
then
afterwards
when
it
rose
a
little
I
sold
off
all
*NL*
I
had
!
It
brought
only
a
small
profit
to
me
;
while
the
farmers
kept
*NL*
theirs
,
expecting
higher
figures
--
yes
,
though
the
rats
were
gnawing
the
*NL*
ricks
hollow
.
Just
when
I
sold
the
markets
went
lower
,
and
I
bought
up
*NL*
the
corn
of
those
who
had
been
holding
back
at
less
price
than
my
first
*NL*
purchases
.
And
then
,
''
cried
Farfrae
impetuously
,
his
face
alight
,
``
I
*NL*
sold
it
a
few
weeks
after
,
when
it
happened
to
go
up
again
!
And
so
,
by
*NL*
contenting
mysel
'
with
small
profits
frequently
repeated
,
I
soon
made
*NL*
five
hundred
pounds
--
yes
!
''
--
-LRB-
bringing
down
his
hand
upon
the
table
,
and
*NL*
quite
forgetting
where
he
was
-RRB-
--
``
while
the
others
by
keeping
theirs
in
*NL*
hand
made
nothing
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
regarded
him
with
a
critical
interest
.
He
was
quite
a
new
type
*NL*
of
person
to
her
.
At
last
his
eye
fell
upon
the
lady
's
and
their
glances
*NL*
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
now
,
I
'm
wearying
you
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
,
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
colouring
a
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
otherwise
.
You
are
most
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
Farfrae
who
showed
the
modest
pink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
all
you
Scotchmen
,
''
she
added
in
hasty
correction
.
``
So
free
from
*NL*
Southern
extremes
.
We
common
people
are
all
one
way
or
the
other
--
warm
*NL*
or
cold
,
passionate
or
frigid
.
You
have
both
temperatures
going
on
in
*NL*
you
at
the
same
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
mean
that
?
Ye
were
best
to
explain
clearly
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
animated
--
then
you
are
thinking
of
getting
on
.
You
are
sad
the
*NL*
next
moment
--
then
you
are
thinking
of
Scotland
and
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
think
of
home
sometimes
!
''
he
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
--
as
far
as
I
can
.
But
it
was
an
old
house
where
I
was
born
,
and
*NL*
they
pulled
it
down
for
improvements
,
so
I
seem
hardly
to
have
any
home
*NL*
to
think
of
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
did
not
add
,
as
she
might
have
done
,
that
the
house
was
in
St.
*NL*
Helier
,
and
not
in
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
mountains
,
and
the
mists
and
the
rocks
,
they
are
there
!
And
*NL*
do
n't
they
seem
like
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
to
me
--
they
do
to
me
,
''
he
murmured
.
And
his
mind
could
be
seen
*NL*
flying
away
northwards
.
Whether
its
origin
were
national
or
personal
,
it
*NL*
was
quite
true
what
Lucetta
had
said
,
that
the
curious
double
strands
*NL*
in
Farfrae
's
thread
of
life
--
the
commercial
and
the
romantic
--
were
very
*NL*
distinct
at
times
.
Like
the
colours
in
a
variegated
cord
those
contrasts
*NL*
could
be
seen
intertwisted
,
yet
not
mingling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wishing
you
were
back
again
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Farfrae
,
suddenly
recalling
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fair
without
the
windows
was
now
raging
thick
and
loud
.
It
was
the
*NL*
chief
hiring
fair
of
the
year
,
and
differed
quite
from
the
market
of
a
*NL*
few
days
earlier
.
In
substance
it
was
a
whitey-brown
crowd
flecked
with
*NL*
white
--
this
being
the
body
of
labourers
waiting
for
places
.
The
long
*NL*
bonnets
of
the
women
,
like
waggon-tilts
,
their
cotton
gowns
and
checked
*NL*
shawls
,
mixed
with
the
carters
'
smockfrocks
;
for
they
,
too
,
entered
into
*NL*
the
hiring
.
Among
the
rest
,
at
the
corner
of
the
pavement
,
stood
an
*NL*
old
shepherd
,
who
attracted
the
eyes
of
Lucetta
and
Farfrae
by
his
*NL*
stillness
.
He
was
evidently
a
chastened
man
.
The
battle
of
life
had
been
*NL*
a
sharp
one
with
him
,
for
,
to
begin
with
,
he
was
a
man
of
small
frame
.
*NL*
He
was
now
so
bowed
by
hard
work
and
years
that
,
approaching
from
*NL*
behind
,
a
person
could
hardly
see
his
head
.
He
had
planted
the
stem
of
*NL*
his
crook
in
the
gutter
and
was
resting
upon
the
bow
,
which
was
polished
*NL*
to
silver
brightness
by
the
long
friction
of
his
hands
.
He
had
quite
*NL*
forgotten
where
he
was
,
and
what
he
had
come
for
,
his
eyes
being
bent
*NL*
on
the
ground
.
A
little
way
off
negotiations
were
proceeding
which
*NL*
had
reference
to
him
;
but
he
did
not
hear
them
,
and
there
seemed
to
be
*NL*
passing
through
his
mind
pleasant
visions
of
the
hiring
successes
of
his
*NL*
prime
,
when
his
skill
laid
open
to
him
any
farm
for
the
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
negotiations
were
between
a
farmer
from
a
distant
county
and
the
old
*NL*
man
's
son
.
In
these
there
was
a
difficulty
.
The
farmer
would
not
take
*NL*
the
crust
without
the
crumb
of
the
bargain
,
in
other
words
,
the
old
man
*NL*
without
the
younger
;
and
the
son
had
a
sweetheart
on
his
present
farm
,
*NL*
who
stood
by
,
waiting
the
issue
with
pale
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
to
leave
ye
,
Nelly
,
''
said
the
young
man
with
emotion
.
``
But
,
*NL*
you
see
,
I
ca
n't
starve
father
,
and
he
's
out
o
'
work
at
Lady-day
.
'T
is
*NL*
only
thirty-five
mile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
's
lips
quivered
.
``
Thirty-five
mile
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
Ah
!
't
is
*NL*
enough
!
I
shall
never
see
`
ee
again
!
''
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
hopeless
length
*NL*
of
traction
for
Dan
Cupid
's
magnet
;
for
young
men
were
young
men
at
*NL*
Casterbridge
as
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
no
,
no
--
I
never
shall
,
''
she
insisted
,
when
he
pressed
her
hand
;
and
*NL*
she
turned
her
face
to
Lucetta
's
wall
to
hide
her
weeping
.
The
farmer
*NL*
said
he
would
give
the
young
man
half-an-hour
for
his
answer
,
and
went
*NL*
away
,
leaving
the
group
sorrowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
's
eyes
,
full
of
tears
,
met
Farfrae
's
.
His
,
too
,
to
her
surprise
,
*NL*
were
moist
at
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
hard
,
''
she
said
with
strong
feelings
.
``
Lovers
ought
not
to
*NL*
be
parted
like
that
!
O
,
if
I
had
my
wish
,
I
'd
let
people
live
and
love
*NL*
at
their
pleasure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
can
manage
that
they
'll
not
be
parted
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
I
want
*NL*
a
young
carter
;
and
perhaps
I
'll
take
the
old
man
too
--
yes
;
he
'll
not
be
*NL*
very
expensive
,
and
doubtless
he
will
answer
my
pairrpose
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
you
are
so
good
!
''
she
cried
,
delighted
.
``
Go
and
tell
them
,
and
let
*NL*
me
know
if
you
have
succeeded
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
went
out
,
and
she
saw
him
speak
to
the
group
.
The
eyes
of
*NL*
all
brightened
;
the
bargain
was
soon
struck
.
Farfrae
returned
to
her
*NL*
immediately
it
was
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
kind-hearted
of
you
,
indeed
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
``
For
my
part
,
I
have
*NL*
resolved
that
all
my
servants
shall
have
lovers
if
they
want
them
!
Do
*NL*
make
the
same
resolve
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
looked
more
serious
,
waving
his
head
a
half
turn
.
``
I
must
be
a
*NL*
little
stricter
than
that
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
--
a
thriving
woman
;
and
I
am
a
struggling
hay-and-corn
*NL*
merchant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
very
ambitious
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
I
cannet
explain
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
talk
to
ladies
,
*NL*
ambitious
or
no
;
and
that
's
true
,
''
said
Donald
with
grave
regret
.
``
I
try
*NL*
to
be
civil
to
a
'
folk
--
no
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
as
you
say
,
''
replied
she
,
sensibly
getting
the
upper
*NL*
hand
in
these
exchanges
of
sentiment
.
Under
this
revelation
of
insight
*NL*
Farfrae
again
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
thick
of
the
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
farmers
met
and
shook
hands
,
and
being
quite
near
the
window
their
*NL*
remarks
could
be
heard
as
others
'
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
young
Mr.
Farfrae
this
morning
?
''
asked
one
.
``
He
promised
*NL*
to
meet
me
here
at
the
stroke
of
twelve
;
but
I
've
gone
athwart
and
about
*NL*
the
fair
half-a-dozen
times
,
and
never
a
sign
of
him
:
though
he
's
mostly
*NL*
a
man
to
his
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
forgot
the
engagement
,
''
murmured
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
must
go
,
''
said
she
;
``
must
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
.
But
he
still
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
go
,
''
she
urged
.
``
You
will
lose
a
customer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Miss
Templeman
,
you
will
make
me
angry
,
''
exclaimed
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
suppose
you
do
n't
go
;
but
stay
a
little
longer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
anxiously
at
the
farmer
who
was
seeking
him
and
who
just
then
*NL*
ominously
walked
across
to
where
Henchard
was
standing
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
into
the
room
and
at
her
.
``
I
like
staying
;
but
I
fear
I
must
go
!
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
Business
ought
not
to
be
neglected
,
ought
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
a
single
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
.
I
'll
come
another
time
--
if
I
may
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
she
said
.
``
What
has
happened
to
us
to-day
is
very
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
to
think
over
when
we
are
alone
,
it
's
like
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
that
.
It
is
commonplace
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
not
say
that
.
O
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whatever
it
has
been
,
it
is
now
over
;
and
the
market
calls
you
to
*NL*
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
Market
--
business
!
I
wish
there
were
no
business
in
the
*NL*
warrld
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
almost
laughed
--
she
would
quite
have
laughed
--
but
that
there
was
*NL*
a
little
emotion
going
in
her
at
the
time
.
``
How
you
change
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
You
should
not
change
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
wished
such
things
before
,
''
said
the
Scotchman
,
with
a
*NL*
simple
,
shamed
,
apologetic
look
for
his
weakness
.
``
It
is
only
since
*NL*
coming
here
and
seeing
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
's
the
case
,
you
had
better
not
look
at
me
any
longer
.
Dear
me
,
*NL*
I
feel
I
have
quite
demoralized
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
or
look
not
,
I
will
see
you
in
my
thoughts
.
Well
,
I
'll
*NL*
go
--
thank
you
for
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
staying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
'll
get
into
my
market-mind
when
I
've
been
out
a
few
minutes
,
''
*NL*
he
murmured
.
``
But
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
she
said
eagerly
,
``
You
may
hear
them
speak
of
me
in
*NL*
Casterbridge
as
time
goes
on
.
If
they
tell
you
I
'm
a
coquette
,
which
*NL*
some
may
,
because
of
the
incidents
of
my
life
,
do
n't
believe
it
,
for
I
*NL*
am
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
I
will
not
!
''
he
said
fervidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
two
.
She
had
enkindled
the
young
man
's
enthusiasm
till
he
was
*NL*
quite
brimming
with
sentiment
;
while
he
from
merely
affording
her
a
new
*NL*
form
of
idleness
,
had
gone
on
to
wake
her
serious
solicitude
.
Why
was
*NL*
this
?
They
could
not
have
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
as
a
young
girl
would
hardly
have
looked
at
a
tradesman
.
But
her
*NL*
ups
and
downs
,
capped
by
her
indiscretions
with
Henchard
had
made
her
*NL*
uncritical
as
to
station
.
In
her
poverty
she
had
met
with
repulse
from
*NL*
the
society
to
which
she
had
belonged
,
and
she
had
no
great
zest
for
*NL*
renewing
an
attempt
upon
it
now
.
Her
heart
longed
for
some
ark
into
*NL*
which
it
could
fly
and
be
at
rest
.
Rough
or
smooth
she
did
not
care
so
*NL*
long
as
it
was
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
was
shown
out
,
it
having
entirely
escaped
him
that
he
had
called
*NL*
to
see
Elizabeth
.
Lucetta
at
the
window
watched
him
threading
the
maze
*NL*
of
farmers
and
farmers
'
men
.
She
could
see
by
his
gait
that
he
*NL*
was
conscious
of
her
eyes
,
and
her
heart
went
out
to
him
for
his
*NL*
modesty
--
pleaded
with
her
sense
of
his
unfitness
that
he
might
be
*NL*
allowed
to
come
again
.
He
entered
the
market-house
,
and
she
could
see
*NL*
him
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
minutes
later
,
when
she
had
left
the
window
,
knocks
,
not
*NL*
of
multitude
but
of
strength
,
sounded
through
the
house
,
and
the
*NL*
waiting-maid
tripped
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mayor
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
had
reclined
herself
,
and
she
was
looking
dreamily
through
*NL*
her
fingers
.
She
did
not
answer
at
once
,
and
the
maid
repeated
the
*NL*
information
with
the
addition
,
``
And
he
's
afraid
he
has
n't
much
time
to
*NL*
spare
,
he
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Then
tell
him
that
as
I
have
a
headache
I
wo
n't
detain
him
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
message
was
taken
down
,
and
she
heard
the
door
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
had
come
to
Casterbridge
to
quicken
Henchard
's
feelings
with
*NL*
regard
to
her
.
She
had
quickened
them
,
and
now
she
was
indifferent
to
*NL*
the
achievement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
morning
view
of
Elizabeth-Jane
as
a
disturbing
element
changed
,
and
*NL*
she
no
longer
felt
strongly
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
the
girl
for
*NL*
her
stepfather
's
sake
.
When
the
young
woman
came
in
,
sweetly
unconscious
*NL*
of
the
turn
in
the
tide
,
Lucetta
went
up
to
her
,
and
said
quite
*NL*
sincerely
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
you
've
come
.
You
'll
live
with
me
a
long
time
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
as
a
watch-dog
to
keep
her
father
off
--
what
a
new
idea
.
Yet
*NL*
it
was
not
unpleasing
.
Henchard
had
neglected
her
all
these
days
,
after
*NL*
compromising
her
indescribably
in
the
past
.
The
least
he
could
have
done
*NL*
when
he
found
himself
free
,
and
herself
affluent
,
would
have
been
to
*NL*
respond
heartily
and
promptly
to
her
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
emotions
rose
,
fell
,
undulated
,
filled
her
with
wild
surmise
at
*NL*
their
suddenness
;
and
so
passed
Lucetta
's
experiences
of
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
24
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Elizabeth-Jane
,
little
thinking
what
her
malignant
star
had
done
to
*NL*
blast
the
budding
attentions
she
had
won
from
Donald
Farfrae
,
was
glad
*NL*
to
hear
Lucetta
's
words
about
remaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
in
addition
to
Lucetta
's
house
being
a
home
,
that
raking
view
of
*NL*
the
market-place
which
it
afforded
had
as
much
attraction
for
her
as
for
*NL*
Lucetta
.
The
carrefour
was
like
the
regulation
Open
Place
in
spectacular
*NL*
dramas
,
where
the
incidents
that
occur
always
happen
to
bear
on
the
*NL*
lives
of
the
adjoining
residents
.
Farmers
,
merchants
,
dairymen
,
quacks
,
*NL*
hawkers
,
appeared
there
from
week
to
week
,
and
disappeared
as
the
*NL*
afternoon
wasted
away
.
It
was
the
node
of
all
orbits
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Saturday
to
Saturday
was
as
from
day
to
day
with
the
two
young
*NL*
women
now
.
In
an
emotional
sense
they
did
not
live
at
all
during
the
*NL*
intervals
.
Wherever
they
might
go
wandering
on
other
days
,
on
market-day
*NL*
they
were
sure
to
be
at
home
.
Both
stole
sly
glances
out
of
the
window
*NL*
at
Farfrae
's
shoulders
and
poll
.
His
face
they
seldom
saw
,
for
,
either
*NL*
through
shyness
,
or
not
to
disturb
his
mercantile
mood
,
he
avoided
*NL*
looking
towards
their
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
things
went
on
,
till
a
certain
market-morning
brought
a
new
*NL*
sensation
.
Elizabeth
and
Lucetta
were
sitting
at
breakfast
when
a
parcel
*NL*
containing
two
dresses
arrived
for
the
latter
from
London
.
She
called
*NL*
Elizabeth
from
her
breakfast
,
and
entering
her
friend
's
bedroom
*NL*
Elizabeth
saw
the
gowns
spread
out
on
the
bed
,
one
of
a
deep
cherry
*NL*
colour
,
the
other
lighter
--
a
glove
lying
at
the
end
of
each
sleeve
,
a
*NL*
bonnet
at
the
top
of
each
neck
,
and
parasols
across
the
gloves
,
*NL*
Lucetta
standing
beside
the
suggested
human
figure
in
an
attitude
of
*NL*
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
think
so
hard
about
it
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
marking
the
*NL*
intensity
with
which
Lucetta
was
alternating
the
question
whether
this
*NL*
or
that
would
suit
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
settling
upon
new
clothes
is
so
trying
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
``
You
are
*NL*
that
person
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
one
of
the
arrangements
-RRB-
,
``
or
you
are
THAT
*NL*
totally
different
person
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
the
other
-RRB-
,
``
for
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
coming
spring
and
one
of
the
two
,
you
do
n't
know
which
,
may
turn
out
to
*NL*
be
very
objectionable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
finally
decided
by
Miss
Templeman
that
she
would
be
the
*NL*
cherry-coloured
person
at
all
hazards
.
The
dress
was
pronounced
to
be
a
*NL*
fit
,
and
Lucetta
walked
with
it
into
the
front
room
,
Elizabeth
following
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
exceptionally
bright
for
the
time
of
year
.
The
sun
fell
*NL*
so
flat
on
the
houses
and
pavement
opposite
Lucetta
's
residence
that
*NL*
they
poured
their
brightness
into
her
rooms
.
Suddenly
,
after
a
rumbling
*NL*
of
wheels
,
there
were
added
to
this
steady
light
a
fantastic
series
of
*NL*
circling
irradiations
upon
the
ceiling
,
and
the
companions
turned
to
the
*NL*
window
.
Immediately
opposite
a
vehicle
of
strange
description
had
come
*NL*
to
a
standstill
,
as
if
it
had
been
placed
there
for
exhibition
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
new-fashioned
agricultural
implement
called
a
horse-drill
,
*NL*
till
then
unknown
,
in
its
modern
shape
,
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
*NL*
where
the
venerable
seed-lip
was
still
used
for
sowing
as
in
the
days
*NL*
of
the
Heptarchy
.
Its
arrival
created
about
as
much
sensation
in
the
*NL*
corn-market
as
a
flying
machine
would
create
at
Charing
Cross
.
The
*NL*
farmers
crowded
round
it
,
women
drew
near
it
,
children
crept
under
and
*NL*
into
it
.
The
machine
was
painted
in
bright
hues
of
green
,
yellow
,
and
*NL*
red
,
and
it
resembled
as
a
whole
a
compound
of
hornet
,
grasshopper
,
*NL*
and
shrimp
,
magnified
enormously
.
Or
it
might
have
been
likened
to
an
*NL*
upright
musical
instrument
with
the
front
gone
.
That
was
how
it
struck
*NL*
Lucetta
.
``
Why
,
it
is
a
sort
of
agricultural
piano
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
something
to
do
with
corn
,
''
said
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
who
thought
of
introducing
it
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Donald
Farfrae
was
in
the
minds
of
both
as
the
innovator
,
for
though
not
*NL*
a
farmer
he
was
closely
leagued
with
farming
operations
.
And
as
if
*NL*
in
response
to
their
thought
he
came
up
at
that
moment
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
machine
,
walked
round
it
,
and
handled
it
as
if
he
knew
something
about
*NL*
its
make
.
The
two
watchers
had
inwardly
started
at
his
coming
,
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
left
the
window
,
went
to
the
back
of
the
room
,
and
stood
as
if
*NL*
absorbed
in
the
panelling
of
the
wall
.
She
hardly
knew
that
she
had
done
*NL*
this
till
Lucetta
,
animated
by
the
conjunction
of
her
new
attire
with
*NL*
the
sight
of
Farfrae
,
spoke
out
:
``
Let
us
go
and
look
at
the
instrument
,
*NL*
whatever
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
's
bonnet
and
shawl
were
pitchforked
on
in
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
they
went
out
.
Among
all
the
agriculturists
gathered
round
the
only
*NL*
appropriate
possessor
of
the
new
machine
seemed
to
be
Lucetta
,
because
*NL*
she
alone
rivalled
it
in
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
examined
it
curiously
;
observing
the
rows
of
trumpet-shaped
tubes
*NL*
one
within
the
other
,
the
little
scoops
,
like
revolving
salt-spoons
,
*NL*
which
tossed
the
seed
into
the
upper
ends
of
the
tubes
that
conducted
it
*NL*
to
the
ground
;
till
somebody
said
,
``
Good
morning
,
Elizabeth-Jane
.
''
She
*NL*
looked
up
,
and
there
was
her
stepfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
greeting
had
been
somewhat
dry
and
thunderous
,
and
Elizabeth-Jane
,
*NL*
embarrassed
out
of
her
equanimity
,
stammered
at
random
,
``
This
is
the
*NL*
lady
I
live
with
,
father
--
Miss
Templeman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
put
his
hand
to
his
hat
,
which
he
brought
down
with
a
great
*NL*
wave
till
it
met
his
body
at
the
knee
.
Miss
Templeman
bowed
.
``
I
am
*NL*
happy
to
become
acquainted
with
you
,
Mr.
Henchard
,
''
she
said
.
``
This
is
a
*NL*
curious
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Henchard
replied
;
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
it
,
and
still
more
*NL*
forcibly
to
ridicule
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
brought
it
here
?
''
said
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
ask
me
,
ma'am
!
''
said
Henchard
.
``
The
thing
--
why
't
is
*NL*
impossible
it
should
act
.
'T
was
brought
here
by
one
of
our
machinists
on
*NL*
the
recommendation
of
a
jumped-up
jackanapes
of
a
fellow
who
thinks
--
''
*NL*
His
eye
caught
Elizabeth-Jane
's
imploring
face
,
and
he
stopped
,
probably
*NL*
thinking
that
the
suit
might
be
progressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
go
away
.
Then
something
seemed
to
occur
which
his
*NL*
stepdaughter
fancied
must
really
be
a
hallucination
of
hers
.
A
murmur
*NL*
apparently
came
from
Henchard
's
lips
in
which
she
detected
the
words
,
*NL*
``
You
refused
to
see
me
!
''
reproachfully
addressed
to
Lucetta
.
She
could
*NL*
not
believe
that
they
had
been
uttered
by
her
stepfather
;
unless
,
*NL*
indeed
,
they
might
have
been
spoken
to
one
of
the
yellow-gaitered
*NL*
farmers
near
them
.
Yet
Lucetta
seemed
silent
,
and
then
all
thought
of
*NL*
the
incident
was
dissipated
by
the
humming
of
a
song
,
which
sounded
*NL*
as
though
from
the
interior
of
the
machine
.
Henchard
had
by
this
time
*NL*
vanished
into
the
market-house
,
and
both
the
women
glanced
towards
the
*NL*
corn-drill
.
They
could
see
behind
it
the
bent
back
of
a
man
who
was
*NL*
pushing
his
head
into
the
internal
works
to
master
their
simple
secrets
.
*NL*
The
hummed
song
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
apprehended
the
singer
in
a
moment
,
and
looked
guilty
*NL*
of
she
did
not
know
what
.
Lucetta
next
recognized
him
,
and
more
*NL*
mistress
of
herself
said
archly
,
``
The
`
Lass
of
Gowrie
'
from
inside
of
a
*NL*
seed-drill
--
what
a
phenomenon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
at
last
with
his
investigation
the
young
man
stood
upright
,
*NL*
and
met
their
eyes
across
the
summit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
looking
at
the
wonderful
new
drill
,
''
Miss
Templeman
said
.
``
But
*NL*
practically
it
is
a
stupid
thing
--
is
it
not
?
''
she
added
,
on
the
strength
*NL*
of
Henchard
's
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stupid
?
O
no
!
''
said
Farfrae
gravely
.
``
It
will
revolutionize
sowing
*NL*
heerabout
!
No
more
sowers
flinging
their
seed
about
broadcast
,
so
that
*NL*
some
falls
by
the
wayside
and
some
among
thorns
,
and
all
that
.
*NL*
Each
grain
will
go
straight
to
its
intended
place
,
and
nowhere
else
*NL*
whatever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
romance
of
the
sower
is
gone
for
good
,
''
observed
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
who
felt
herself
at
one
with
Farfrae
in
Bible-reading
*NL*
at
least
.
''
`
He
that
observeth
the
wind
shall
not
sow
,
'
so
the
Preacher
*NL*
said
;
but
his
words
will
not
be
to
the
point
any
more
.
How
things
*NL*
change
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
;
ay
...
It
must
be
so
!
''
Donald
admitted
,
his
gaze
fixing
itself
on
a
*NL*
blank
point
far
away
.
``
But
the
machines
are
already
very
common
in
the
*NL*
East
and
North
of
England
,
''
he
added
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
seemed
to
be
outside
this
train
of
sentiment
,
her
acquaintance
*NL*
with
the
Scriptures
being
somewhat
limited
.
``
Is
the
machine
yours
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
of
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
becoming
embarrassed
and
deferential
at
the
*NL*
sound
of
her
voice
,
though
with
Elizabeth
Jane
he
was
quite
at
his
ease
.
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
I
merely
recommended
that
it
should
be
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
silence
which
followed
Farfrae
appeared
only
conscious
of
her
;
*NL*
to
have
passed
from
perception
of
Elizabeth
into
a
brighter
sphere
of
*NL*
existence
than
she
appertained
to
.
Lucetta
,
discerning
that
he
was
much
*NL*
mixed
that
day
,
partly
in
his
mercantile
mood
and
partly
in
his
romantic
*NL*
one
,
said
gaily
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
forsake
the
machine
for
us
,
''
and
went
indoors
with
her
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
felt
that
she
had
been
in
the
way
,
though
why
was
*NL*
unaccountable
to
her
.
Lucetta
explained
the
matter
somewhat
by
saying
*NL*
when
they
were
again
in
the
sitting-room
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
occasion
to
speak
to
Mr.
Farfrae
the
other
day
,
and
so
I
knew
him
*NL*
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
was
very
kind
towards
Elizabeth
that
day
.
Together
they
saw
the
*NL*
market
thicken
,
and
in
course
of
time
thin
away
with
the
slow
decline
*NL*
of
the
sun
towards
the
upper
end
of
town
,
its
rays
taking
the
street
*NL*
endways
and
enfilading
the
long
thoroughfare
from
top
to
bottom
.
The
*NL*
gigs
and
vans
disappeared
one
by
one
till
there
was
not
a
vehicle
in
the
*NL*
street
.
The
time
of
the
riding
world
was
over
;
the
pedestrian
world
held
*NL*
sway
.
Field
labourers
and
their
wives
and
children
trooped
in
from
the
*NL*
villages
for
their
weekly
shopping
,
and
instead
of
a
rattle
of
wheels
*NL*
and
a
tramp
of
horses
ruling
the
sound
as
earlier
,
there
was
nothing
but
*NL*
the
shuffle
of
many
feet
.
All
the
implements
were
gone
;
all
the
farmers
;
*NL*
all
the
moneyed
class
.
The
character
of
the
town
's
trading
had
changed
*NL*
from
bulk
to
multiplicity
and
pence
were
handled
now
as
pounds
had
been
*NL*
handled
earlier
in
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
and
Elizabeth
looked
out
upon
this
,
for
though
it
was
night
and
*NL*
the
street
lamps
were
lighted
,
they
had
kept
their
shutters
unclosed
.
In
*NL*
the
faint
blink
of
the
fire
they
spoke
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
was
distant
with
you
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
And
having
forgotten
the
momentary
mystery
of
Henchard
's
seeming
*NL*
speech
to
Lucetta
she
continued
,
``
It
is
because
he
does
not
think
I
am
*NL*
respectable
.
I
have
tried
to
be
so
more
than
you
can
imagine
,
but
in
*NL*
vain
!
My
mother
's
separation
from
my
father
was
unfortunate
for
me
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
have
shadows
like
that
upon
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
seemed
to
wince
.
``
I
do
not
--
of
that
kind
precisely
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
but
you
may
feel
a
--
sense
of
disgrace
--
shame
--
in
other
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
had
any
such
feeling
?
''
said
the
younger
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
''
said
Lucetta
quickly
.
``
I
was
thinking
of
--
what
happens
sometimes
*NL*
when
women
get
themselves
in
strange
positions
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
*NL*
from
no
fault
of
their
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
make
them
very
unhappy
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
them
anxious
;
for
might
not
other
women
despise
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
altogether
despise
them
.
Yet
not
quite
like
or
respect
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
winced
again
.
Her
past
was
by
no
means
secure
from
*NL*
investigation
,
even
in
Casterbridge
.
For
one
thing
Henchard
had
never
*NL*
returned
to
her
the
cloud
of
letters
she
had
written
and
sent
him
in
*NL*
her
first
excitement
.
Possibly
they
were
destroyed
;
but
she
could
have
*NL*
wished
that
they
had
never
been
written
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rencounter
with
Farfrae
and
his
bearings
towards
Lucetta
had
made
*NL*
the
reflective
Elizabeth
more
observant
of
her
brilliant
and
amiable
*NL*
companion
.
A
few
days
afterwards
,
when
her
eyes
met
Lucetta
's
as
*NL*
the
latter
was
going
out
,
she
somehow
knew
that
Miss
Templeman
was
*NL*
nourishing
a
hope
of
seeing
the
attractive
Scotchman
.
The
fact
was
*NL*
printed
large
all
over
Lucetta
's
cheeks
and
eyes
to
any
one
who
could
*NL*
read
her
as
Elizabeth-Jane
was
beginning
to
do
.
Lucetta
passed
on
and
*NL*
closed
the
street
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
seer
's
spirit
took
possession
of
Elizabeth
,
impelling
her
to
sit
down
*NL*
by
the
fire
and
divine
events
so
surely
from
data
already
her
own
that
*NL*
they
could
be
held
as
witnessed
.
She
followed
Lucetta
thus
mentally
--
saw
*NL*
her
encounter
Donald
somewhere
as
if
by
chance
--
saw
him
wear
his
special
*NL*
look
when
meeting
women
,
with
an
added
intensity
because
this
one
was
*NL*
Lucetta
.
She
depicted
his
impassioned
manner
;
beheld
the
indecision
*NL*
of
both
between
their
lothness
to
separate
and
their
desire
not
to
be
*NL*
observed
;
depicted
their
shaking
of
hands
;
how
they
probably
parted
with
*NL*
frigidity
in
their
general
contour
and
movements
,
only
in
the
smaller
*NL*
features
showing
the
spark
of
passion
,
thus
invisible
to
all
but
*NL*
themselves
.
This
discerning
silent
witch
had
not
done
thinking
of
these
*NL*
things
when
Lucetta
came
noiselessly
behind
her
and
made
her
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
true
as
she
had
pictured
--
she
could
have
sworn
it
.
Lucetta
*NL*
had
a
heightened
luminousness
in
her
eye
over
and
above
the
advanced
*NL*
colour
of
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
seen
Mr.
Farfrae
,
''
said
Elizabeth
demurely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
``
How
did
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knelt
down
on
the
hearth
and
took
her
friend
's
hands
excitedly
in
*NL*
her
own
.
But
after
all
she
did
not
say
when
or
how
she
had
seen
him
or
*NL*
what
he
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
she
became
restless
;
in
the
morning
she
was
feverish
;
and
*NL*
at
breakfast-time
she
told
her
companion
that
she
had
something
on
her
*NL*
mind
--
something
which
concerned
a
person
in
whom
she
was
interested
*NL*
much
.
Elizabeth
was
earnest
to
listen
and
sympathize
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
person
--
a
lady
--
once
admired
a
man
much
--
very
much
,
''
she
said
*NL*
tentatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
intimate
--
rather
.
He
did
not
think
so
deeply
of
her
as
she
*NL*
did
of
him
.
But
in
an
impulsive
moment
,
purely
out
of
reparation
,
he
*NL*
proposed
to
make
her
his
wife
.
She
agreed
.
But
there
was
an
unsuspected
*NL*
hitch
in
the
proceedings
;
though
she
had
been
so
far
compromised
with
*NL*
him
that
she
felt
she
could
never
belong
to
another
man
,
as
a
pure
*NL*
matter
of
conscience
,
even
if
she
should
wish
to
.
After
that
they
were
*NL*
much
apart
,
heard
nothing
of
each
other
for
a
long
time
,
and
she
felt
*NL*
her
life
quite
closed
up
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
suffered
much
on
account
of
him
;
though
I
should
add
that
he
could
*NL*
not
altogether
be
blamed
for
what
had
happened
.
At
last
the
obstacle
*NL*
which
separated
them
was
providentially
removed
;
and
he
came
to
marry
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delightful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
interval
she
--
my
poor
friend
--
had
seen
a
man
,
she
liked
*NL*
better
than
him
.
Now
comes
the
point
:
Could
she
in
honour
dismiss
the
*NL*
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
man
she
liked
better
--
that
's
bad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lucetta
,
looking
pained
at
a
boy
who
was
swinging
the
town
*NL*
pump-handle
.
``
It
is
bad
!
Though
you
must
remember
that
she
was
forced
*NL*
into
an
equivocal
position
with
the
first
man
by
an
accident
--
that
he
*NL*
was
not
so
well
educated
or
refined
as
the
second
,
and
that
she
had
*NL*
discovered
some
qualities
in
the
first
that
rendered
him
less
desirable
*NL*
as
a
husband
than
she
had
at
first
thought
him
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
answer
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
thoughtfully
.
``
It
is
so
*NL*
difficult
.
It
wants
a
Pope
to
settle
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
prefer
not
to
perhaps
?
''
Lucetta
showed
in
her
appealing
tone
how
*NL*
much
she
leant
on
Elizabeth
's
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Templeman
,
''
admitted
Elizabeth
.
``
I
would
rather
not
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Lucetta
seemed
relieved
by
the
simple
fact
of
having
*NL*
opened
out
the
situation
a
little
,
and
was
slowly
convalescent
of
her
*NL*
headache
.
``
Bring
me
a
looking-glass
.
How
do
I
appear
to
people
?
''
she
*NL*
said
languidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
a
little
worn
,
''
answered
Elizabeth
,
eyeing
her
as
a
critic
eyes
*NL*
a
doubtful
painting
;
fetching
the
glass
she
enabled
Lucetta
to
survey
*NL*
herself
in
it
,
which
Lucetta
anxiously
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
I
wear
well
,
as
times
go
!
''
she
observed
after
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
fairly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
worst
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
your
eyes
--
I
notice
a
little
brownness
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
That
is
my
worst
place
,
I
know
.
How
many
years
more
do
you
think
I
*NL*
shall
last
before
I
get
hopelessly
plain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
curious
in
the
way
in
which
Elizabeth
,
though
*NL*
the
younger
,
had
come
to
play
the
part
of
experienced
sage
in
these
*NL*
discussions
.
``
It
may
be
five
years
,
''
she
said
judicially
.
``
Or
,
with
a
*NL*
quiet
life
,
as
many
as
ten
.
With
no
love
you
might
calculate
on
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
seemed
to
reflect
on
this
as
on
an
unalterable
,
impartial
*NL*
verdict
.
She
told
Elizabeth-Jane
no
more
of
the
past
attachment
she
had
*NL*
roughly
adumbrated
as
the
experiences
of
a
third
person
;
and
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
who
in
spite
of
her
philosophy
was
very
tender-hearted
,
sighed
that
*NL*
night
in
bed
at
the
thought
that
her
pretty
,
rich
Lucetta
did
not
treat
*NL*
her
to
the
full
confidence
of
names
and
dates
in
her
confessions
.
For
by
*NL*
the
``
she
''
of
Lucetta
's
story
Elizabeth
had
not
been
beguiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
25
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
phase
of
the
supersession
of
Henchard
in
Lucetta
's
heart
was
*NL*
an
experiment
in
calling
on
her
performed
by
Farfrae
with
some
apparent
*NL*
trepidation
.
Conventionally
speaking
he
conversed
with
both
Miss
*NL*
Templeman
and
her
companion
;
but
in
fact
it
was
rather
that
Elizabeth
*NL*
sat
invisible
in
the
room
.
Donald
appeared
not
to
see
her
at
all
,
and
*NL*
answered
her
wise
little
remarks
with
curtly
indifferent
monosyllables
,
*NL*
his
looks
and
faculties
hanging
on
the
woman
who
could
boast
of
a
more
*NL*
Protean
variety
in
her
phases
,
moods
,
opinions
,
and
also
principles
,
*NL*
than
could
Elizabeth
.
Lucetta
had
persisted
in
dragging
her
into
the
*NL*
circle
;
but
she
had
remained
like
an
awkward
third
point
which
that
*NL*
circle
would
not
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Henchard
's
daughter
bore
up
against
the
frosty
ache
of
the
*NL*
treatment
,
as
she
had
borne
up
under
worse
things
,
and
contrived
as
soon
*NL*
as
possible
to
get
out
of
the
inharmonious
room
without
being
missed
.
*NL*
The
Scotchman
seemed
hardly
the
same
Farfrae
who
had
danced
with
her
and
*NL*
walked
with
her
in
a
delicate
poise
between
love
and
friendship
--
that
*NL*
period
in
the
history
of
a
love
when
alone
it
can
be
said
to
be
*NL*
unalloyed
with
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stoically
looked
from
her
bedroom
window
,
and
contemplated
her
fate
*NL*
as
if
it
were
written
on
the
top
of
the
church-tower
hard
by
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
*NL*
said
at
last
,
bringing
down
her
palm
upon
the
sill
with
a
pat
:
``
HE
is
*NL*
the
second
man
of
that
story
she
told
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Henchard
's
smouldering
sentiments
towards
Lucetta
had
been
*NL*
fanned
into
higher
and
higher
inflammation
by
the
circumstances
of
the
*NL*
case
.
He
was
discovering
that
the
young
woman
for
whom
he
once
felt
a
*NL*
pitying
warmth
which
had
been
almost
chilled
out
of
him
by
reflection
,
*NL*
was
,
when
now
qualified
with
a
slight
inaccessibility
and
a
more
matured
*NL*
beauty
,
the
very
being
to
make
him
satisfied
with
life
.
Day
after
day
*NL*
proved
to
him
,
by
her
silence
,
that
it
was
no
use
to
think
of
bringing
*NL*
her
round
by
holding
aloof
;
so
he
gave
in
,
and
called
upon
her
again
,
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
being
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
the
room
to
her
with
a
heavy
tread
of
some
awkwardness
,
his
*NL*
strong
,
warm
gaze
upon
her
--
like
the
sun
beside
the
moon
in
comparison
*NL*
with
Farfrae
's
modest
look
--
and
with
something
of
a
hail-fellow
bearing
,
*NL*
as
,
indeed
,
was
not
unnatural
.
But
she
seemed
so
transubstantiated
*NL*
by
her
change
of
position
,
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
in
such
cool
*NL*
friendship
,
that
he
became
deferential
,
and
sat
down
with
a
perceptible
*NL*
loss
of
power
.
He
understood
but
little
of
fashion
in
dress
,
yet
enough
*NL*
to
feel
himself
inadequate
in
appearance
beside
her
whom
he
had
hitherto
*NL*
been
dreaming
of
as
almost
his
property
.
She
said
something
very
polite
*NL*
about
his
being
good
enough
to
call
.
This
caused
him
to
recover
balance
.
*NL*
He
looked
her
oddly
in
the
face
,
losing
his
awe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
have
called
,
Lucetta
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
does
that
*NL*
nonsense
mean
?
You
know
I
could
n't
have
helped
myself
if
I
had
*NL*
wished
--
that
is
,
if
I
had
any
kindness
at
all
.
I
've
called
to
say
that
*NL*
I
am
ready
,
as
soon
as
custom
will
permit
,
to
give
you
my
name
in
return
*NL*
for
your
devotion
and
what
you
lost
by
it
in
thinking
too
little
of
*NL*
yourself
and
too
much
of
me
;
to
say
that
you
can
fix
the
day
or
month
,
*NL*
with
my
full
consent
,
whenever
in
your
opinion
it
would
be
seemly
:
you
*NL*
know
more
of
these
things
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
full
early
yet
,
''
she
said
evasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
I
suppose
it
is
.
But
you
know
,
Lucetta
,
I
felt
directly
my
*NL*
poor
ill-used
Susan
died
,
and
when
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
marrying
*NL*
again
,
that
after
what
had
happened
between
us
it
was
my
duty
not
to
let
*NL*
any
unnecessary
delay
occur
before
putting
things
to
rights
.
Still
,
I
*NL*
would
n't
call
in
a
hurry
,
because
--
well
,
you
can
guess
how
this
money
*NL*
you
've
come
into
made
me
feel
.
''
His
voice
slowly
fell
;
he
was
conscious
*NL*
that
in
this
room
his
accents
and
manner
wore
a
roughness
not
observable
*NL*
in
the
street
.
He
looked
about
the
room
at
the
novel
hangings
and
*NL*
ingenious
furniture
with
which
she
had
surrounded
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
life
I
did
n't
know
such
furniture
as
this
could
be
bought
in
*NL*
Casterbridge
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
can
it
be
,
''
said
she
.
``
Nor
will
it
till
fifty
years
more
of
*NL*
civilization
have
passed
over
the
town
.
It
took
a
waggon
and
four
horses
*NL*
to
get
it
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
.
It
looks
as
if
you
were
living
on
capital
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
I
am
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
.
But
the
fact
is
,
your
setting
up
like
this
makes
my
*NL*
beaming
towards
you
rather
awkward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
answer
was
not
really
needed
,
and
he
did
not
furnish
one
.
``
Well
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
``
there
's
nobody
in
the
world
I
would
have
wished
to
see
enter
*NL*
into
this
wealth
before
you
,
Lucetta
,
and
nobody
,
I
am
sure
,
who
will
*NL*
become
it
more
.
''
He
turned
to
her
with
congratulatory
admiration
so
*NL*
fervid
that
she
shrank
somewhat
,
notwithstanding
that
she
knew
him
so
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
all
that
,
''
said
she
,
rather
with
an
air
*NL*
of
speaking
ritual
.
The
stint
of
reciprocal
feeling
was
perceived
,
and
*NL*
Henchard
showed
chagrin
at
once
--
nobody
was
more
quick
to
show
that
than
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
obliged
or
not
for
`
t.
Though
the
things
I
say
may
not
have
*NL*
the
polish
of
what
you
've
lately
learnt
to
expect
for
the
first
time
in
*NL*
your
life
,
they
are
real

my
lady
Lucetta
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
rather
a
rude
way
of
speaking
to
me
,
''
pouted
Lucetta
,
with
*NL*
stormy
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
''
replied
Henchard
hotly
.
``
But
there
,
there
,
I
do
n't
wish
*NL*
to
quarrel
with

I
come
with
an
honest
proposal
for
silencing
your
*NL*
Jersey
enemies
,
and
you
ought
to
be
thankful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
speak
so
!
''
she
answered
,
firing
quickly
.
``
Knowing
that
my
*NL*
only
crime
was
the
indulging
in
a
foolish
girl
's
passion
for
you
with
*NL*
too
little
regard
for
correctness
,
and
that
I
was
what
I
call
innocent
*NL*
all
the
time
they
called
me
guilty
,
you
ought
not
to
be
so
cutting
!
I
*NL*
suffered
enough
at
that
worrying
time
,
when
you
wrote
to
tell
me
of
*NL*
your
wife
's
return
and
my
consequent
dismissal
,
and
if
I
am
a
little
*NL*
independent
now
,
surely
the
privilege
is
due
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
it
is
not
by
what
is

in
this
life

but
by
*NL*
what
appears

that

are
judged
;
and
I
therefore
think
you
ought
to
*NL*
accept
me

for
your
own
good
name
's
sake

What
is
known
in
your
native
*NL*
Jersey

get
known
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
keep
on
about
Jersey
!
I
am
English

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

Well

what
do
you
say
to
my
proposal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
Lucetta
had
the
move
;
and
yet
*NL*
she
was
backward
.
``
For
the
present
let
things
be
,
''
she
said
with
some
*NL*
embarrassment
.
``
Treat
me
as
an
acquaintance
,
and
I
'll
treat
you
as
*NL*
one
.
Time
will
--
''
She
stopped
;
and
he
said
nothing
to
fill
the
gap
for
*NL*
awhile
,
there
being
no
pressure
of
half
acquaintance
to
drive
them
into
*NL*
speech
if
they
were
not
minded
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
the
wind
blows
,
is
it
?
''
he
said
at
last
grimly
,
nodding
*NL*
an
affirmative
to
his
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
yellow
flood
of
reflected
sunlight
filled
the
room
for
a
few
instants
.
*NL*
It
was
produced
by
the
passing
of
a
load
of
newly
trussed
hay
from
the
*NL*
country
,
in
a
waggon
marked
with
Farfrae
's
name
.
Beside
it
rode
Farfrae
*NL*
himself
on
horseback
.
Lucetta
's
face
became
--
as
a
woman
's
face
becomes
*NL*
when
the
man
she
loves
rises
upon
her
gaze
like
an
apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
turn
of
the
eye
by
Henchard
,
a
glance
from
the
window
,
and
the
*NL*
secret
of
her
inaccessibility
would
have
been
revealed
.
But
Henchard
in
*NL*
estimating
her
tone
was
looking
down
so
plumb-straight
that
he
did
not
*NL*
note
the
warm
consciousness
upon
Lucetta
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
have
thought
it
--
I
should
n't
have
thought
it
of
women
!
''
he
*NL*
said
emphatically
by-and-by
,
rising
and
shaking
himself
into
activity
;
*NL*
while
Lucetta
was
so
anxious
to
divert
him
from
any
suspicion
of
the
*NL*
truth
that
she
asked
him
to
be
in
no
hurry
.
Bringing
him
some
apples
she
*NL*
insisted
upon
paring
one
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
take
it
.
``
No
,
no
;
such
is
not
for
me
,
''
he
said
drily
,
and
*NL*
moved
to
the
door
.
At
going
out
he
turned
his
eye
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
to
live
in
Casterbridge
entirely
on
my
account
,
''
he
said
.
``
Yet
*NL*
now
you
are
here
you
wo
n't
have
anything
to
say
to
my
offer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
gone
down
the
staircase
when
she
dropped
upon
the
sofa
and
*NL*
jumped
up
again
in
a
fit
of
desperation
.
``
I
WILL
love
him
!
''
she
cried
*NL*
passionately
;
``
as
for
HIM
--
he
's
hot-tempered
and
stern
,
and
it
would
be
*NL*
madness
to
bind
myself
to
him
knowing
that
.
I
wo
n't
be
a
slave
to
the
*NL*
past
--
I
'll
love
where
I
choose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
having
decided
to
break
away
from
Henchard
one
might
have
supposed
*NL*
her
capable
of
aiming
higher
than
Farfrae
.
But
Lucetta
reasoned
nothing
:
*NL*
she
feared
hard
words
from
the
people
with
whom
she
had
been
earlier
*NL*
associated
;
she
had
no
relatives
left
;
and
with
native
lightness
of
*NL*
heart
took
kindly
to
what
fate
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
surveying
the
position
of
Lucetta
between
her
two
lovers
*NL*
from
the
crystalline
sphere
of
a
straightforward
mind
,
did
not
fail
to
*NL*
perceive
that
her
father
,
as
she
called
him
,
and
Donald
Farfrae
became
*NL*
more
desperately
enamoured
of
her
friend
every
day
.
On
Farfrae
's
side
*NL*
it
was
the
unforced
passion
of
youth
.
On
Henchard
's
the
artificially
*NL*
stimulated
coveting
of
maturer
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pain
she
experienced
from
the
almost
absolute
obliviousness
to
*NL*
her
existence
that
was
shown
by
the
pair
of
them
became
at
times
half
*NL*
dissipated
by
her
sense
of
its
humourousness
.
When
Lucetta
had
pricked
*NL*
her
finger
they
were
as
deeply
concerned
as
if
she
were
dying
;
when
she
*NL*
herself
had
been
seriously
sick
or
in
danger
they
uttered
a
conventional
*NL*
word
of
sympathy
at
the
news
,
and
forgot
all
about
it
immediately
.
*NL*
But
,
as
regarded
Henchard
,
this
perception
of
hers
also
caused
her
*NL*
some
filial
grief
;
she
could
not
help
asking
what
she
had
done
to
*NL*
be
neglected
so
,
after
the
professions
of
solicitude
he
had
made
.
As
*NL*
regarded
Farfrae
,
she
thought
,
after
honest
reflection
,
that
it
was
*NL*
quite
natural
.
What
was
she
beside
Lucetta
?
--
as
one
of
the
``
meaner
*NL*
beauties
of
the
night
,
''
when
the
moon
had
risen
in
the
skies
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
learnt
the
lesson
of
renunciation
,
and
was
as
familiar
with
the
*NL*
wreck
of
each
day
's
wishes
as
with
the
diurnal
setting
of
the
sun
.
If
*NL*
her
earthly
career
had
taught
her
few
book
philosophies
it
had
at
least
*NL*
well
practised
her
in
this
.
Yet
her
experience
had
consisted
less
in
*NL*
a
series
of
pure
disappointments
than
in
a
series
of
substitutions
.
*NL*
Continually
it
had
happened
that
what
she
had
desired
had
not
been
*NL*
granted
her
,
and
that
what
had
been
granted
her
she
had
not
desired
.
So
*NL*
she
viewed
with
an
approach
to
equanimity
the
now
cancelled
days
when
*NL*
Donald
had
been
her
undeclared
lover
,
and
wondered
what
unwished-for
*NL*
thing
Heaven
might
send
her
in
place
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
26
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
on
a
fine
spring
morning
Henchard
and
Farfrae
met
in
the
*NL*
chestnut-walk
which
ran
along
the
south
wall
of
the
town
.
Each
had
just
*NL*
come
out
from
his
early
breakfast
,
and
there
was
not
another
soul
near
.
*NL*
Henchard
was
reading
a
letter
from
Lucetta
,
sent
in
answer
to
a
note
*NL*
from
him
,
in
which
she
made
some
excuse
for
not
immediately
granting
him
*NL*
a
second
interview
that
he
had
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Donald
had
no
wish
to
enter
into
conversation
with
his
former
friend
on
*NL*
their
present
constrained
terms
;
neither
would
he
pass
him
in
scowling
*NL*
silence
.
He
nodded
,
and
Henchard
did
the
same
.
They
receded
from
each
*NL*
other
several
paces
when
a
voice
cried
``
Farfrae
!
''
It
was
Henchard
's
,
who
*NL*
stood
regarding
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
,
''
said
Henchard
,
as
if
it
were
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
thought
and
not
of
the
man
which
made
him
speak
,
``
do
you
remember
my
*NL*
story
of
that
second
woman
--
who
suffered
for
her
thoughtless
intimacy
*NL*
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
my
telling
`
ee
how
it
all
began
and
how
it
ended
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
offered
to
marry
her
now
that
I
can
;
but
she
wo
n't
marry
*NL*
me
.
Now
what
would
you
think
of
her
--
I
put
it
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ye
owe
her
nothing
more
now
,
''
said
Farfrae
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
Henchard
,
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
had
looked
up
from
a
letter
to
ask
his
questions
completely
shut
*NL*
out
from
Farfrae
's
mind
all
vision
of
Lucetta
as
the
culprit
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
her
present
position
was
so
different
from
that
of
the
young
woman
of
*NL*
Henchard
's
story
as
of
itself
to
be
sufficient
to
blind
him
absolutely
*NL*
to
her
identity
.
As
for
Henchard
,
he
was
reassured
by
Farfrae
's
words
*NL*
and
manner
against
a
suspicion
which
had
crossed
his
mind
.
They
were
not
*NL*
those
of
a
conscious
rival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
that
there
was
rivalry
by
some
one
he
was
firmly
persuaded
.
He
could
*NL*
feel
it
in
the
air
around
Lucetta
,
see
it
in
the
turn
of
her
pen
.
There
*NL*
was
an
antagonistic
force
in
exercise
,
so
that
when
he
had
tried
to
*NL*
hang
near
her
he
seemed
standing
in
a
refluent
current
.
That
it
was
not
*NL*
innate
caprice
he
was
more
and
more
certain
.
Her
windows
gleamed
as
*NL*
if
they
did
not
want
him
;
her
curtains
seem
to
hang
slily
,
as
if
*NL*
they
screened
an
ousting
presence
.
To
discover
whose
presence
that
*NL*
was
--
whether
really
Farfrae
's
after
all
,
or
another
's
--
he
exerted
*NL*
himself
to
the
utmost
to
see
her
again
;
and
at
length
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
interview
,
when
she
offered
him
tea
,
he
made
it
a
point
to
launch
*NL*
a
cautious
inquiry
if
she
knew
Mr.
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
yes
,
she
knew
him
,
she
declared
;
she
could
not
help
knowing
almost
*NL*
everybody
in
Casterbridge
,
living
in
such
a
gazebo
over
the
centre
and
*NL*
arena
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasant
young
fellow
,
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
both
know
him
,
''
said
kind
Elizabeth-Jane
,
to
relieve
her
companion
's
*NL*
divined
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
knock
at
the
door
;
literally
,
three
full
knocks
and
a
little
*NL*
one
at
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
kind
of
knock
means
half-and-half
--
somebody
between
gentle
*NL*
and
simple
,
''
said
the
corn-merchant
to
himself
.
``
I
should
n't
wonder
*NL*
therefore
if
it
is
he
.
''
In
a
few
seconds
surely
enough
Donald
walked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
was
full
of
little
fidgets
and
flutters
,
which
increased
*NL*
Henchard
's
suspicions
without
affording
any
special
proof
of
their
*NL*
correctness
.
He
was
well-nigh
ferocious
at
the
sense
of
the
queer
*NL*
situation
in
which
he
stood
towards
this
woman
.
One
who
had
reproached
*NL*
him
for
deserting
her
when
calumniated
,
who
had
urged
claims
upon
his
*NL*
consideration
on
that
account
,
who
had
lived
waiting
for
him
,
who
at
the
*NL*
first
decent
opportunity
had
come
to
ask
him
to
rectify
,
by
making
her
*NL*
his
,
the
false
position
into
which
she
had
placed
herself
for
his
sake
;
*NL*
such
she
had
been
.
And
now
he
sat
at
her
tea-table
eager
to
gain
her
*NL*
attention
,
and
in
his
amatory
rage
feeling
the
other
man
present
to
be
a
*NL*
villain
,
just
as
any
young
fool
of
a
lover
might
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
stiffly
side
by
side
at
the
darkening
table
,
like
some
Tuscan
*NL*
painting
of
the
two
disciples
supping
at
Emmaus
.
Lucetta
,
forming
the
*NL*
third
and
haloed
figure
,
was
opposite
them
;
Elizabeth-Jane
,
being
out
*NL*
of
the
game
,
and
out
of
the
group
,
could
observe
all
from
afar
,
like
*NL*
the
evangelist
who
had
to
write
it
down
:
that
there
were
long
spaces
of
*NL*
taciturnity
,
when
all
exterior
circumstances
were
subdued
to
the
touch
*NL*
of
spoons
and
china
,
the
click
of
a
heel
on
the
pavement
under
the
*NL*
window
,
the
passing
of
a
wheelbarrow
or
cart
,
the
whistling
of
the
*NL*
carter
,
the
gush
of
water
into
householders
'
buckets
at
the
town-pump
*NL*
opposite
,
the
exchange
of
greetings
among
their
neighbours
,
and
the
*NL*
rattle
of
the
yokes
by
which
they
carried
off
their
evening
supply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
bread-and-butter
?
''
said
Lucetta
to
Henchard
and
Farfrae
equally
,
*NL*
holding
out
between
them
a
plateful
of
long
slices
.
Henchard
took
a
*NL*
slice
by
one
end
and
Donald
by
the
other
;
each
feeling
certain
he
was
*NL*
the
man
meant
;
neither
let
go
,
and
the
slice
came
in
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
am
so
sorry
!
''
cried
Lucetta
,
with
a
nervous
titter
.
Farfrae
tried
*NL*
to
laugh
;
but
he
was
too
much
in
love
to
see
the
incident
in
any
but
a
*NL*
tragic
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
ridiculous
of
all
three
of
them
!
''
said
Elizabeth
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
left
the
house
with
a
ton
of
conjecture
,
though
without
a
grain
*NL*
of
proof
,
that
the
counterattraction
was
Farfrae
;
and
therefore
he
*NL*
would
not
make
up
his
mind
.
Yet
to
Elizabeth-Jane
it
was
plain
as
the
*NL*
town-pump
that
Donald
and
Lucetta
were
incipient
lovers
.
More
than
once
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
care
,
Lucetta
had
been
unable
to
restrain
her
glance
*NL*
from
flitting
across
into
Farfrae
's
eyes
like
a
bird
to
its
nest
.
But
*NL*
Henchard
was
constructed
upon
too
large
a
scale
to
discern
such
minutiae
*NL*
as
these
by
an
evening
light
,
which
to
him
were
as
the
notes
of
an
*NL*
insect
that
lie
above
the
compass
of
the
human
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
disturbed
.
And
the
sense
of
occult
rivalry
in
suitorship
was
*NL*
so
much
superadded
to
the
palpable
rivalry
of
their
business
lives
.
To
*NL*
the
coarse
materiality
of
that
rivalry
it
added
an
inflaming
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thus
vitalized
antagonism
took
the
form
of
action
by
Henchard
*NL*
sending
for
Jopp
,
the
manager
originally
displaced
by
Farfrae
's
arrival
.
*NL*
Henchard
had
frequently
met
this
man
about
the
streets
,
observed
that
*NL*
his
clothing
spoke
of
neediness
,
heard
that
he
lived
in
Mixen
*NL*
Lane
--
a
back
slum
of
the
town
,
the
pis
aller
of
Casterbridge
*NL*
domiciliation
--
itself
almost
a
proof
that
a
man
had
reached
a
stage
when
*NL*
he
would
not
stick
at
trifles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
came
after
dark
,
by
the
gates
of
the
storeyard
,
and
felt
his
way
*NL*
through
the
hay
and
straw
to
the
office
where
Henchard
sat
in
solitude
*NL*
awaiting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
again
out
of
a
foreman
,
''
said
the
corn-factor
.
``
Are
you
in
a
*NL*
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
much
as
a
beggar
's
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
named
his
price
,
which
was
very
moderate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
can
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
hour
and
moment
,
sir
,
''
said
Jopp
,
who
,
standing
hands-pocketed
*NL*
at
the
street
corner
till
the
sun
had
faded
the
shoulders
of
his
coat
*NL*
to
scarecrow
green
,
had
regularly
watched
Henchard
in
the
market-place
,
*NL*
measured
him
,
and
learnt
him
,
by
virtue
of
the
power
which
the
still
*NL*
man
has
in
his
stillness
of
knowing
the
busy
one
better
than
he
knows
*NL*
himself
.
Jopp
too
,
had
had
a
convenient
experience
;
he
was
the
only
one
*NL*
in
Casterbridge
besides
Henchard
and
the
close-lipped
Elizabeth
who
knew
*NL*
that
Lucetta
came
truly
from
Jersey
,
and
but
proximately
from
Bath
.
``
I
*NL*
know
Jersey
too
,
sir
,
''
he
said
.
``
Was
living
there
when
you
used
to
do
*NL*
business
that
way
.
O
yes
--
have
often
seen
ye
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
Very
good
.
Then
the
thing
is
settled
.
The
testimonials
you
*NL*
showed
me
when
you
first
tried
for
'
t
are
sufficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
characters
deteriorated
in
time
of
need
possibly
did
not
occur
*NL*
to
Henchard
.
Jopp
said
,
``
Thank
you
,
''
and
stood
more
firmly
,
in
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
at
last
he
officially
belonged
to
that
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Henchard
,
digging
his
strong
eyes
into
Jopp
's
face
,
``
one
*NL*
thing
is
necessary
to
me
,
as
the
biggest
corn-and-hay
dealer
in
these
*NL*
parts
.
The
Scotchman
,
who
's
taking
the
town
trade
so
bold
into
*NL*
his
hands
,
must
be
cut
out
.
D'ye
hear
?
We
two
ca
n't
live
side
by
*NL*
side
--
that
's
clear
and
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
it
all
,
''
said
Jopp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
fair
competition
I
mean
,
of
course
,
''
Henchard
continued
.
``
But
as
*NL*
hard
,
keen
,
and
unflinching
as
fair
--
rather
more
so
.
By
such
a
desperate
*NL*
bid
against
him
for
the

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
all
that
way
of

,
''
said
the
new
foreman
.
Jopp
's
dislike
of
*NL*
Farfrae
as
the
man
who
had
once
ursurped
his
place
,
while
it
made
him
*NL*
a
willing
tool
,
made
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
commercially
as
unsafe
a
*NL*
colleague
as
Henchard
could
have
chosen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
think
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
he
must
have
some
glass
that
he
*NL*
sees
next
year
in
.
He
has
such
a
knack
of
making
everything
bring
him
*NL*
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
deep
beyond
all
honest
men
's
discerning
,
but
we
must
make
him
*NL*
shallower
.
We
'll
undersell
him
,
and
over-buy
him
,
and
so
snuff
him
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
entered
into
specific
details
of
the
process
by
which
this
*NL*
would
be
accomplished
,
and
parted
at
a
late
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
heard
by
accident
that
Jopp
had
been
engaged
by
her
*NL*
stepfather
.
She
was
so
fully
convinced
that
he
was
not
the
right
man
for
*NL*
the
place
that
,
at
the
risk
of
making
Henchard
angry
,
she
expressed
*NL*
her
apprehension
to
him
when
they
met
.
But
it
was
done
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
Henchard
shut
up
her
argument
with
a
sharp
rebuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
season
's
weather
seemed
to
favour
their
scheme
.
The
time
was
in
*NL*
the
years
immediately
before
foreign
competition
had
revolutionized
*NL*
the
trade
in
grain
;
when
still
,
as
from
the
earliest
ages
,
the
wheat
*NL*
quotations
from
month
to
month
depended
entirely
upon
the
home
harvest
.
*NL*
A
bad
harvest
,
or
the
prospect
of
one
,
would
double
the
price
of
corn
in
*NL*
a
few
weeks
;
and
the
promise
of
a
good
yield
would
lower
it
as
rapidly
.
*NL*
Prices
were
like
the
roads
of
the
period
,
steep
in
gradient
,
reflecting
*NL*
in
their
phases
the
local
conditions
,
without
engineering
,
levellings
,
*NL*
or
averages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmer
's
income
was
ruled
by
the
wheat-crop
within
his
own
horizon
,
*NL*
and
the
wheat-crop
by
the
weather
.
Thus
in
person
,
he
became
a
sort
of
*NL*
flesh-barometer
,
with
feelers
always
directed
to
the
sky
and
wind
around
*NL*
him
.
The
local
atmosphere
was
everything
to
him
;
the
atmospheres
of
*NL*
other
countries
a
matter
of
indifference
.
The
people
,
too
,
who
were
*NL*
not
farmers
,
the
rural
multitude
,
saw
in
the
god
of
the
weather
a
*NL*
more
important
personage
than
they
do
now
.
Indeed
,
the
feeling
of
the
*NL*
peasantry
in
this
matter
was
so
intense
as
to
be
almost
unrealizable
in
*NL*
these
equable
days
.
Their
impulse
was
well-nigh
to
prostrate
themselves
*NL*
in
lamentation
before
untimely
rains
and
tempests
,
which
came
as
the
*NL*
Alastor
of
those
households
whose
crime
it
was
to
be
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
midsummer
they
watched
the
weather-cocks
as
men
waiting
in
*NL*
antechambers
watch
the
lackey
.
Sun
elated
them
;
quiet
rain
sobered
them
;
*NL*
weeks
of
watery
tempest
stupefied
them
.
That
aspect
of
the
sky
which
*NL*
they
now
regard
as
disagreeable
they
then
beheld
as
maleficent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
June
,
and
the
weather
was
very
unfavourable
.
Casterbridge
,
being
*NL*
as
it
were
the
bell-board
on
which
all
the
adjacent
hamlets
and
villages
*NL*
sounded
their
notes
,
was
decidedly
dull
.
Instead
of
new
articles
in
the
*NL*
shop-windows
those
that
had
been
rejected
in
the
foregoing
summer
were
*NL*
brought
out
again
;
superseded
reap-hooks
,
badly-shaped
rakes
,
shop-worn
*NL*
leggings
,
and
time-stiffened
water-tights
reappeared
,
furbished
up
as
*NL*
near
to
new
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
,
backed
by
Jopp
,
read
a
disastrous
garnering
,
and
resolved
to
*NL*
base
his
strategy
against
Farfrae
upon
that
reading
.
But
before
acting
*NL*
he
wished
--
what
so
many
have
wished
--
that
he
could
know
for
certain
what
*NL*
was
at
present
only
strong
probability
.
He
was
superstitious
--
as
such
*NL*
head-strong
natures
often
are
--
and
he
nourished
in
his
mind
an
idea
*NL*
bearing
on
the
matter
;
an
idea
he
shrank
from
disclosing
even
to
Jopp
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
lonely
hamlet
a
few
miles
from
the
town
--
so
lonely
that
what
are
*NL*
called
lonely
villages
were
teeming
by
comparison
--
there
lived
a
man
of
*NL*
curious
repute
as
a
forecaster
or
weather-prophet
.
The
way
to
his
house
*NL*
was
crooked
and
miry
--
even
difficult
in
the
present
unpropitious
season
.
*NL*
One
evening
when
it
was
raining
so
heavily
that
ivy
and
laurel
resounded
*NL*
like
distant
musketry
,
and
an
out-door
man
could
be
excused
for
*NL*
shrouding
himself
to
his
ears
and
eyes
,
such
a
shrouded
figure
on
foot
*NL*
might
have
been
perceived
travelling
in
the
direction
of
the
hazel-copse
*NL*
which
dripped
over
the
prophet
's
cot
.
The
turnpike-road
became
a
lane
,
*NL*
the
lane
a
cart-track
,
the
cart-track
a
bridle-path
,
the
bridle-path
a
*NL*
foot-way
,
the
foot-way
overgrown
.
The
solitary
walker
slipped
here
and
*NL*
there
,
and
stumbled
over
the
natural
springes
formed
by
the
brambles
,
*NL*
till
at
length
he
reached
the
house
,
which
,
with
its
garden
,
was
*NL*
surrounded
with
a
high
,
dense
hedge
.
The
cottage
,
comparatively
a
large
*NL*
one
,
had
been
built
of
mud
by
the
occupier
's
own
hands
,
and
thatched
*NL*
also
by
himself
.
Here
he
had
always
lived
,
and
here
it
was
assumed
he
*NL*
would
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
existed
on
unseen
supplies
;
for
it
was
an
anomalous
thing
that
while
*NL*
there
was
hardly
a
soul
in
the
neighbourhood
but
affected
to
laugh
at
*NL*
this
man
's
assertions
,
uttering
the
formula
,
``
There
's
nothing
in
'em
,
''
*NL*
with
full
assurance
on
the
surface
of
their
faces
,
very
few
of
them
were
*NL*
unbelievers
in
their
secret
hearts
.
Whenever
they
consulted
him
they
*NL*
did
it
``
for
a
fancy
.
''
When
they
paid
him
they
said
,
``
Just
a
trifle
for
*NL*
Christmas
,
''
or
``
Candlemas
,
''
as
the
case
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
preferred
more
honesty
in
his
clients
,
and
less
sham
*NL*
ridicule
;
but
fundamental
belief
consoled
him
for
superficial
irony
.
As
*NL*
stated
,
he
was
enabled
to
live
;
people
supported
him
with
their
backs
*NL*
turned
.
He
was
sometimes
astonished
that
men
could
profess
so
little
and
*NL*
believe
so
much
at
his
house
,
when
at
church
they
professed
so
much
and
*NL*
believed
so
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
his
back
he
was
called
``
Wide-oh
,
''
on
account
of
his
reputation
;
*NL*
to
his
face
``
Mr.
''
Fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hedge
of
his
garden
formed
an
arch
over
the
entrance
,
and
a
door
*NL*
was
inserted
as
in
a
wall
.
Outside
the
door
the
tall
traveller
stopped
,
*NL*
bandaged
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
as
if
he
were
suffering
from
*NL*
toothache
,
and
went
up
the
path
.
The
window
shutters
were
not
closed
,
*NL*
and
he
could
see
the
prophet
within
,
preparing
his
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
answer
to
the
knock
Fall
came
to
the
door
,
candle
in
hand
.
The
*NL*
visitor
stepped
back
a
little
from
the
light
,
and
said
,
``
Can
I
speak
*NL*
to
`
ee
?
''
in
significant
tones
.
The
other
's
invitation
to
come
in
was
*NL*
responded
to
by
the
country
formula
,
``
This
will
do
,
thank
`
ee
,
''
after
*NL*
which
the
householder
had
no
alternative
but
to
come
out
.
He
placed
*NL*
the
candle
on
the
corner
of
the
dresser
,
took
his
hat
from
a
nail
,
and
*NL*
joined
the
stranger
in
the
porch
,
shutting
the
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
long
heard
that
you
can
--
do
things
of
a
sort
?
''
began
the
other
,
*NL*
repressing
his
individuality
as
much
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
so
,
Mr.
Henchard
,
''
said
the
weather-caster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
why
do
you
call
me
that
?
''
asked
the
visitor
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
your
name
.
Feeling
you
'd
come
I
've
waited
for
`
ee
;
*NL*
and
thinking
you
might
be
leery
from
your
walk
I
laid
two
supper
*NL*
plates
--
look
ye
here
.
''
He
threw
open
the
door
and
disclosed
the
*NL*
supper-table
,
at
which
appeared
a
second
chair
,
knife
and
fork
,
plate
*NL*
and
mug
,
as
he
had
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
felt
like
Saul
at
his
reception
by
Samuel
;
he
remained
in
*NL*
silence
for
a
few
moments
,
then
throwing
off
the
disguise
of
frigidity
*NL*
which
he
had
hitherto
preserved
he
said
,
``
Then
I
have
not
come
in
*NL*
vain
...
Now
,
for
instance
,
can
ye
charm
away
warts

*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
trouble

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cure
the
evil

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
've
done

with
consideration

by

*NL*
*NL*
``
Forecast

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
labour
and
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
take
this
,
''
said
Henchard
.
''
'T
is
a
crownpiece
.
Now
,
what
is
the
*NL*
harvest

to

When
can
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
worked
it
out
already
,
and
you
can
know
at
once

-LRB-
The
fact
*NL*
was
that
five
farmers
had
already
been
there
on
the
same
errand
from
*NL*
different
parts
of
the
country
.
-RRB-
``
By
the
sun

,
the
candle-flame
and
swallows

*NL*
the
smell

herbs

likewise
by
the
cats

eyes
,
the
ravens
,
the
*NL*
leeches
,
the
spiders

and
the
dungmixen
,
the
last
fortnight
in
August
*NL*
will
be

rain

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
As

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no

said
Henchard
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

quite

said
Wide-oh
,
without
a
*NL*
sound
of
scorn
.
``
You
have
given
me
a
crown
because
you
've
one
too
many

*NL*
But
wo
n't
you
join
me
at
supper
,
now
't
is
waiting

all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
would
gladly
have
joined
;
for
the
savour
of
the
stew
*NL*
had
floated
from
the
cottage
into
the
porch
with
such
appetizing
*NL*
distinctness
that
the
meat
,
the
onions
,
the
pepper
,
and
the
herbs
could
*NL*
be
severally
recognized
by
his
nose
.
But
as
sitting
down
to
*NL*
hob-and-nob
there
would
have
seemed
to
mark
him
too
implicitly
as
the
*NL*
weather-caster
's
apostle
,
he
declined
,
and
went
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
Saturday
Henchard
bought
grain
to
such
an
enormous
extent
that
*NL*
there
was
quite
a
talk
about
his
purchases
among
his
neighbours
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
the
wine
merchant
,
and
the
doctor
;
also
on
the
next
,
and
on
*NL*
all
available
days
.
When
his
granaries
were
full
to
choking
all
the
*NL*
weather-cocks
of
Casterbridge
creaked
and
set
their
faces
in
another
*NL*
direction
,
as
if
tired
of
the
south-west
.
The
weather
changed
;
the
*NL*
sunlight
,
which
had
been
like
tin
for
weeks
,
assumed
the
hues
of
*NL*
topaz
.
The
temperament
of
the
welkin
passed
from
the
phlegmatic
to
*NL*
the
sanguine
;
an
excellent
harvest
was
almost
a
certainty
;
and
as
a
*NL*
consequence
prices
rushed
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
transformations
,
lovely
to
the
outsider
,
to
the
wrong-headed
*NL*
corn-dealer
were
terrible
.
He
was
reminded
of
what
he
had
well
known
*NL*
before
,
that
a
man
might
gamble
upon
the
square
green
areas
of
fields
as
*NL*
readily
as
upon
those
of
a
card-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
had
backed
bad
weather
,
and
apparently
lost
.
He
had
mistaken
*NL*
the
turn
of
the
flood
for
the
turn
of
the
ebb
.
His
dealings
had
been
so
*NL*
extensive
that
settlement
could
not
long
be
postponed
,
and
to
settle
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
sell
off
corn
that
he
had
bought
only
a
few
weeks
before
*NL*
at
figures
higher
by
many
shillings
a
quarter
.
Much
of
the
corn
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
;
it
had
not
even
been
moved
from
the
ricks
in
which
it
lay
*NL*
stacked
miles
away
.
Thus
he
lost
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
blaze
of
an
early
August
day
he
met
Farfrae
in
the
market-place
.
*NL*
Farfrae
knew
of
his
dealings
-LRB-
though
he
did
not
guess
their
intended
*NL*
bearing
on
himself
-RRB-
and
commiserated
him
;
for
since
their
exchange
*NL*
of
words
in
the
South
Walk
they
had
been
on
stiffly
speaking
terms
.
*NL*
Henchard
for
the
moment
appeared
to
resent
the
sympathy
;
but
he
suddenly
*NL*
took
a
careless
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
no
,
no
!
--
nothing
serious
,
man
!
''
he
cried
with
fierce
gaiety
.
``
These
*NL*
things
always
happen
,
do
n't
they
?
I
know
it
has
been
said
that
figures
*NL*
have
touched
me
tight
lately
;
but
is
that
anything
rare
?
The
case
is
not
*NL*
so
bad
as
folk
make
out
perhaps
.
And
dammy
,
a
man
must
be
a
fool
to
mind
*NL*
the
common
hazards
of
trade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
to
enter
the
Casterbridge
Bank
that
day
for
reasons
which
*NL*
had
never
before
sent
him
there
--
and
to
sit
a
long
time
in
the
partners
'
*NL*
room
with
a
constrained
bearing
.
It
was
rumoured
soon
after
that
much
*NL*
real
property
as
well
as
vast
stores
of
produce
,
which
had
stood
*NL*
in
Henchard
's
name
in
the
town
and
neighbourhood
,
was
actually
the
*NL*
possession
of
his
bankers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
down
the
steps
of
the
bank
he
encountered
Jopp
.
The
gloomy
*NL*
transactions
just
completed
within
had
added
fever
to
the
original
sting
*NL*
of
Farfrae
's
sympathy
that
morning
,
which
Henchard
fancied
might
be
a
*NL*
satire
disguised
so
that
Jopp
met
with
anything
but
a
bland
reception
.
*NL*
The
latter
was
in
the
act
of
taking
off
his
hat
to
wipe
his
forehead
,
*NL*
and
saying
,
``
A
fine
hot
day
,
''
to
an
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
wipe
and
wipe
,
and
say
,
'
A
fine
hot
day
,
'
can
ye
!
''
cried
*NL*
Henchard
in
a
savage
undertone
,
imprisoning
Jopp
between
himself
and
the
*NL*
bank
wall
.
``
If
it
had
n't
been
for
your
blasted
advice
it
might
have
been
*NL*
a
fine
day
enough
!
Why
did
ye
let
me
go
on
,
hey
?
--
when
a
word
of
doubt
*NL*
from
you
or
anybody
would
have
made
me
think
twice
!
For
you
can
never
be
*NL*
sure
of
weather
till
't
is
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
advice
,
sir
,
was
to
do
what
you
thought
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
useful
fellow
!
And
the
sooner
you
help
somebody
else
in
that
way
the
*NL*
better
!
''
Henchard
continued
his
address
to
Jopp
in
similar
terms
till
it
*NL*
ended
in
Jopp
's
dismissal
there
and
then
,
Henchard
turning
upon
his
heel
*NL*
and
leaving
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
be
sorry
for
this
,
sir
;
sorry
as
a
man
can
be
!
''
said
Jopp
,
*NL*
standing
pale
,
and
looking
after
the
corn-merchant
as
he
disappeared
in
*NL*
the
crowd
of
market-men
hard
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
27
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
eve
of
harvest
.
Prices
being
low
Farfrae
was
buying
.
As
was
*NL*
usual
,
after
reckoning
too
surely
on
famine
weather
the
local
farmers
*NL*
had
flown
to
the
other
extreme
,
and
-LRB-
in
Farfrae
's
opinion
-RRB-
were
selling
*NL*
off
too
recklessly
--
calculating
with
just
a
trifle
too
much
certainty
*NL*
upon
an
abundant
yield
.
So
he
went
on
buying
old
corn
at
its
*NL*
comparatively
ridiculous
price
:
for
the
produce
of
the
previous
year
,
*NL*
though
not
large
,
had
been
of
excellent
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Henchard
had
squared
his
affairs
in
a
disastrous
way
,
and
got
rid
*NL*
of
his
burdensome
purchases
at
a
monstrous
loss
,
the
harvest
began
.
*NL*
There
were
three
days
of
excellent
weather
,
and
then
--
``
What
if
that
*NL*
curst
conjuror
should
be
right
after
all
!
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
,
that
no
sooner
had
the
sickles
begun
to
play
than
the
*NL*
atmosphere
suddenly
felt
as
if
cress
would
grow
in
it
without
other
*NL*
nourishment
.
It
rubbed
people
's
cheeks
like
damp
flannel
when
they
*NL*
walked
abroad
.
There
was
a
gusty
,
high
,
warm
wind
;
isolated
raindrops
*NL*
starred
the
window-panes
at
remote
distances
:
the
sunlight
would
flap
*NL*
out
like
a
quickly
opened
fan
,
throw
the
pattern
of
the
window
upon
the
*NL*
floor
of
the
room
in
a
milky
,
colourless
shine
,
and
withdraw
as
suddenly
*NL*
as
it
had
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
and
hour
it
was
clear
that
there
was
not
to
be
so
*NL*
successful
an
ingathering
after
all
.
If
Henchard
had
only
waited
long
*NL*
enough
he
might
at
least
have
avoided
loss
though
he
had
not
made
a
*NL*
profit
.
But
the
momentum
of
his
character
knew
no
patience
.
At
this
turn
*NL*
of
the
scales
he
remained
silent
.
The
movements
of
his
mind
seemed
to
*NL*
tend
to
the
thought
that
some
power
was
working
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
he
asked
himself
with
eerie
misgiving
;
``
I
wonder
if
it
can
*NL*
be
that
somebody
has
been
roasting
a
waxen
image
of
me
,
or
stirring
an
*NL*
unholy
brew
to
confound
me
!
I
do
n't
believe
in
such
power
;
and
yet
--
what
*NL*
if
they
should
ha
'
been
doing
it
!
''
Even
he
could
not
admit
that
*NL*
the
perpetrator
,
if
any
,
might
be
Farfrae
.
These
isolated
hours
of
*NL*
superstition
came
to
Henchard
in
time
of
moody
depression
,
when
all
his
*NL*
practical
largeness
of
view
had
oozed
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Donald
Farfrae
prospered
.
He
had
purchased
in
so
depressed
a
*NL*
market
that
the
present
moderate
stiffness
of
prices
was
sufficient
to
*NL*
pile
for
him
a
large
heap
of
gold
where
a
little
one
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
'll
soon
be
Mayor
!
''
said
Henchard
.
It
was
indeed
hard
that
the
*NL*
speaker
should
,
of
all
others
,
have
to
follow
the
triumphal
chariot
of
*NL*
this
man
to
the
Capitol
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rivalry
of
the
masters
was
taken
up
by
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
September-night
shades
had
fallen
upon
Casterbridge
;
the
clocks
had
*NL*
struck
half-past
eight
,
and
the
moon
had
risen
.
The
streets
of
the
town
*NL*
were
curiously
silent
for
such
a
comparatively
early
hour
.
A
sound
of
*NL*
jangling
horse-bells
and
heavy
wheels
passed
up
the
street
.
These
were
*NL*
followed
by
angry
voices
outside
Lucetta
's
house
,
which
led
her
and
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
to
run
to
the
windows
,
and
pull
up
the
blinds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbouring
Market
House
and
Town
Hall
abutted
against
its
next
*NL*
neighbour
the
Church
except
in
the
lower
storey
,
where
an
arched
*NL*
thoroughfare
gave
admittance
to
a
large
square
called
Bull
Stake
.
A
*NL*
stone
post
rose
in
the
midst
,
to
which
the
oxen
had
formerly
been
tied
*NL*
for
baiting
with
dogs
to
make
them
tender
before
they
were
killed
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
shambles
.
In
a
corner
stood
the
stocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thoroughfare
leading
to
this
spot
was
now
blocked
by
two
four-horse
*NL*
waggons
and
horses
,
one
laden
with
hay-trusses
,
the
leaders
having
*NL*
already
passed
each
other
,
and
become
entangled
head
to
tail
.
The
*NL*
passage
of
the
vehicles
might
have
been
practicable
if
empty
;
but
built
*NL*
up
with
hay
to
the
bedroom
windows
as
one
was
,
it
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
done
it
a
'
purpose
!
''
said
Farfrae
's
waggoner
.
``
You
can
*NL*
hear
my
horses
'
bells
half-a-mile
such
a
night
as
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
ye
'd
been
minding
your
business
instead
of
zwailing
along
in
such
*NL*
a
gawk-hammer
way
,
you
would
have
zeed
me
!
''
retorted
the
wroth
*NL*
representative
of
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
according
to
the
strict
rule
of
the
road
it
appeared
that
*NL*
Henchard
's
man
was
most
in
the
wrong
,
he
therefore
attempted
to
back
*NL*
into
the
High
Street
.
In
doing
this
the
near
hind-wheel
rose
against
*NL*
the
churchyard
wall
and
the
whole
mountainous
load
went
over
,
two
of
the
*NL*
four
wheels
rising
in
the
air
,
and
the
legs
of
the
thill
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
considering
how
to
gather
up
the
load
the
two
men
closed
in
*NL*
a
fight
with
their
fists
.
Before
the
first
round
was
quite
over
Henchard
*NL*
came
upon
the
spot
,
somebody
having
run
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
sent
the
two
men
staggering
in
contrary
directions
by
collaring
*NL*
one
with
each
hand
,
turned
to
the
horse
that
was
down
,
and
extricated
*NL*
him
after
some
trouble
.
He
then
inquired
into
the
circumstances
;
and
*NL*
seeing
the
state
of
his
waggon
and
its
load
began
hotly
rating
Farfrae
's
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
and
Elizabeth-Jane
had
by
this
time
run
down
to
the
street
*NL*
corner
,
whence
they
watched
the
bright
heap
of
new
hay
lying
in
the
*NL*
moon
's
rays
,
and
passed
and
repassed
by
the
forms
of
Henchard
and
the
*NL*
waggoners
.
The
women
had
witnessed
what
nobody
else
had
seen
--
the
origin
*NL*
of
the
mishap
;
and
Lucetta
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
it
all
,
Mr.
Henchard
,
''
she
cried
;
``
and
your
man
was
most
in
the
*NL*
wrong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
paused
in
his
harangue
and
turned
.
``
Oh
,
I
did
n't
notice
you
,
*NL*
Miss
Templeman
,
''
said
he
.
``
My
man
in
the
wrong
?
Ah
,
to
be
sure
;
to
be
*NL*
sure
!
But
I
beg
your
pardon
notwithstanding
.
The
other
's
is
the
empty
*NL*
waggon
,
and
he
must
have
been
most
to
blame
for
coming
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
saw
it
,
too
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
``
And
I
can
assure
you
he
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
trust
THEIR
senses
!
''
murmured
Henchard
's
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
Henchard
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
sir
,
all
the
women
side
with
Farfrae
--
being
a
damn
young
*NL*
dand
--
of
the
sort
that
he
is
--
one
that
creeps
into
a
maid
's
heart
like
*NL*
the
giddying
worm
into
a
sheep
's
brain
--
making
crooked
seem
straight
to
*NL*
their
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
know
who
that
lady
is
you
talk
about
in
such
a
fashion
?
Do
*NL*
you
know
that
I
pay
my
attentions
to
her
,
and
have
for
some
time
?
Just
*NL*
be
careful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I.
I
know
nothing
,
sir
,
outside
eight
shillings
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
Mr.
Farfrae
is
well
aware
of
it
?
He
's
sharp
in
trade
,
but
he
*NL*
would
n't
do
anything
so
underhand
as
what
you
hint
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
because
Lucetta
heard
this
low
dialogue
,
or
not
her
white
*NL*
figure
disappeared
from
her
doorway
inward
,
and
the
door
was
shut
before
*NL*
Henchard
could
reach
it
to
converse
with
her
further
.
This
disappointed
*NL*
him
,
for
he
had
been
sufficiently
disturbed
by
what
the
man
had
said
to
*NL*
wish
to
speak
to
her
more
closely
.
While
pausing
the
old
constable
came
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
see
that
nobody
drives
against
that
hay
and
waggon
to-night
,
*NL*
Stubberd

''
said
the
corn-merchant
.
``
It
must
bide
till
the
morning
,
for
*NL*
all
hands
are
in
the
field
still
.
And
if
any
coach
or
road-waggon
wants
*NL*
to
come
along
,
tell
'em
they
must
go
round
by
the
back
street
,
and
be
*NL*
hanged
to
'em
...
Any
case
tomorrow
up
in
Hall
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

One
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

's
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
flagrant
female

swearing
and
committing
a
nuisance
in
a
*NL*
horrible
profane
manner
against

wall
,

as

Good

''
*NL*
*NL*
During
those
moments
Henchard
had
determined
to
follow
up
Lucetta
*NL*
notwithstanding
her
elusiveness
,
and
he
knocked
for
admission
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
he
received
was
an
expression
of
Miss
Templeman
's
sorrow
at
*NL*
being
unable
to
see
him
again
that
evening
because
she
had
an
engagement
*NL*
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
walked
away
from
the
door
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
*NL*
and
stood
by
his
hay
in
a
lonely
reverie
,
the
constable
having
strolled
*NL*
elsewhere
,
and
the
horses
being
removed
.
Though
the
moon
was
not
bright
*NL*
as
yet
there
were
no
lamps
lighted
,
and
he
entered
the
shadow
of
one
of
*NL*
the
projecting
jambs
which
formed
the
thoroughfare
to
Bull
Stake
;
here
*NL*
he
watched
Lucetta
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Candle-lights
were
flitting
in
and
out
of
her
bedroom
,
and
it
was
*NL*
obvious
that
she
was
dressing
for
the
appointment
,
whatever
the
nature
*NL*
of
that
might
be
at
such
an
hour
.
The
lights
disappeared
,
the
clock
*NL*
struck
nine
,
and
almost
at
the
moment
Farfrae
came
round
the
opposite
*NL*
corner
and
knocked
.
That
she
had
been
waiting
just
inside
for
him
was
*NL*
certain
,
for
she
instantly
opened
the
door
herself
.
They
went
together
*NL*
by
the
way
of
a
back
lane
westward
,
avoiding
the
front
street
;
guessing
*NL*
where
they
were
going
he
determined
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
harvest
had
been
so
delayed
by
the
capricious
weather
that
whenever
*NL*
a
fine
day
occurred
all
sinews
were
strained
to
save
what
could
be
saved
*NL*
of
the
damaged
crops
.
On
account
of
the
rapid
shortening
of
the
days
the
*NL*
harvesters
worked
by
moonlight
.
Hence
to-night
the
wheat-fields
abutting
*NL*
on
the
two
sides
of
the
square
formed
by
Casterbridge
town
were
animated
*NL*
by
the
gathering
hands
.
Their
shouts
and
laughter
had
reached
Henchard
*NL*
at
the
Market
House
,
while
he
stood
there
waiting
,
and
he
had
little
*NL*
doubt
from
the
turn
which
Farfrae
and
Lucetta
had
taken
that
they
were
*NL*
bound
for
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
the
whole
town
had
gone
into
the
fields
.
The
Casterbridge
*NL*
populace
still
retained
the
primitive
habit
of
helping
one
another
in
*NL*
time
of
need
;
and
thus
,
though
the
corn
belonged
to
the
farming
section
*NL*
of
the
little
community
--
that
inhabiting
the
Durnover
quarter
--
the
*NL*
remainder
was
no
less
interested
in
the
labour
of
getting
it
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
the
top
of
the
lane
Henchard
crossed
the
shaded
avenue
on
the
*NL*
walls
,
slid
down
the
green
rampart
,
and
stood
amongst
the
stubble
.
The
*NL*
``
stitches
''
or
shocks
rose
like
tents
about
the
yellow
expanse
,
those
in
*NL*
the
distance
becoming
lost
in
the
moonlit
hazes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
entered
at
a
point
removed
from
the
scene
of
immediate
*NL*
operations
;
but
two
others
had
entered
at
that
place
,
and
he
could
*NL*
see
them
winding
among
the
shocks
.
They
were
paying
no
regard
to
the
*NL*
direction
of
their
walk
,
whose
vague
serpentining
soon
began
to
*NL*
bear
down
towards
Henchard
.
A
meeting
promised
to
be
awkward
,
and
he
*NL*
therefore
stepped
into
the
hollow
of
the
nearest
shock
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
my
leave
,
''
Lucetta
was
saying
gaily
.
``
Speak
what
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
replied
Farfrae
,
with
the
unmistakable
inflection
of
the
*NL*
lover
pure
,
which
Henchard
had
never
heard
in
full
resonance
of
his
lips
*NL*
before
,
``
you
are
sure
to
be
much
sought
after
for
your
position
,
wealth
,
*NL*
talents
,
and
beauty
.
But
will
ye
resist
the
temptation
to
be
one
of
*NL*
those
ladies
with
lots
of
admirers
--
ay
--
and
be
content
to
have
only
a
*NL*
homely
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
the
speaker
?
''
said
she
,
laughing
.
``
Very
well
,
sir
,
what
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
'm
afraid
that
what
I
feel
will
make
me
forget
my
manners
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
hope
you
'll
never
have
any
,
if
you
lack
them
only
for
that
*NL*
cause
.
''
After
some
broken
words
which
Henchard
lost
she
added
,
``
Are
you
*NL*
sure
you
wo
n't
be
jealous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
seemed
to
assure
her
that
he
would
not
,
by
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
convinced
,
Donald
,
that
I
love
nobody
else
,
''
she
presently
*NL*
said
.
``
But
I
should
wish
to
have
my
own
way
in
some
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
everything
!
What
special
thing
did
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
wished
not
to
live
always
in
Casterbridge
,
for
instance
,
upon
*NL*
finding
that
I
should
not
be
happy
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
did
not
hear
the
reply
;
he
might
have
done
so
and
much
more
,
*NL*
but
he
did
not
care
to
play
the
eavesdropper
.
They
went
on
towards
*NL*
the
scene
of
activity
,
where
the
sheaves
were
being
handed
,
a
dozen
a
*NL*
minute
,
upon
the
carts
and
waggons
which
carried
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
insisted
on
parting
from
Farfrae
when
they
drew
near
the
*NL*
workpeople
.
He
had
some
business
with
them
,
and
,
though
he
entreated
*NL*
her
to
wait
a
few
minutes
,
she
was
inexorable
,
and
tripped
off
homeward
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
thereupon
left
the
field
and
followed
her
.
His
state
of
mind
*NL*
was
such
that
on
reaching
Lucetta
's
door
he
did
not
knock
but
opened
it
,
*NL*
and
walked
straight
up
to
her
sitting-room
,
expecting
to
find
her
*NL*
there
.
But
the
room
was
empty
,
and
he
perceived
that
in
his
haste
he
had
*NL*
somehow
passed
her
on
the
way
hither
.
He
had
not
to
wait
many
minutes
,
*NL*
however
,
for
he
soon
heard
her
dress
rustling
in
the
hall
,
followed
by
a
*NL*
soft
closing
of
the
door
.
In
a
moment
she
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
was
so
low
that
she
did
not
notice
Henchard
at
first
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
she
saw
him
she
uttered
a
little
cry
,
almost
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
frighten
me
so
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
flushed
face
.
``
It
*NL*
is
past
ten
o'clock
,
and
you
have
no
right
to
surprise
me
here
at
such
a
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
've
not
the
right
.
At
any
rate
I
have
the
excuse
.
Is
*NL*
it
so
necessary
that
I
should
stop
to
think
of
manners
and
customs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
for
propriety
,
and
might
injure
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
called
an
hour
ago
,
and
you
would
not
see
me
,
and
I
thought
you
were
*NL*
in
when
I
called
now
.
It
is
you
,
Lucetta
,
who
are
doing
wrong
.
It
is
*NL*
not
proper
in
`
ee
to
throw
me
over
like
this
.
I
have
a
little
matter
to
*NL*
remind
you
of
,
which
you
seem
to
forget
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
--
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
!
''
she
said
through
her
*NL*
hands
,
as
he
,
standing
close
to
the
edge
of
her
gown
,
began
to
allude
to
*NL*
the
Jersey
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ought
to
hear
it
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
came
to
nothing
;
and
through
you
.
Then
why
not
leave
me
the
freedom
*NL*
that
I
gained
with
such
sorrow
!
Had
I
found
that
you
proposed
to
marry
*NL*
me
for
pure
love
I
might
have
felt
bound
now
.
But
I
soon
learnt
that
*NL*
you
had
planned
it
out
of
mere
charity
--
almost
as
an
unpleasant
*NL*
duty
--
because
I
had
nursed
you
,
and
compromised
myself
,
and
you
thought
*NL*
you
must
repay
me
.
After
that
I
did
not
care
for
you
so
deeply
as
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
come
here
to
find
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
ought
to
marry
you
for
conscience
'
sake
,
since
you
were
*NL*
free
,
even
though
I
--
did
not
like
you
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
then
do
n't
you
think
so
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
It
was
only
too
obvious
that
conscience
had
ruled
well
*NL*
enough
till
new
love
had
intervened
and
usurped
that
rule
.
In
feeling
*NL*
this
she
herself
forgot
for
the
moment
her
partially
justifying
*NL*
argument
--
that
having
discovered
Henchard
's
infirmities
of
temper
,
she
*NL*
had
some
excuse
for
not
risking
her
happiness
in
his
hands
after
once
*NL*
escaping
them
.
The
only
thing
she
could
say
was
,
``
I
was
a
poor
girl
*NL*
then
;
and
now
my
circumstances
have
altered
,
so
I
am
hardly
the
same
*NL*
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
.
And
it
makes
the
case
awkward
for
me
.
But
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
touch
your
money
.
I
am
quite
willing
that
every
penny
of
your
property
*NL*
shall
remain
to
your
personal
use
.
Besides
,
that
argument
has
nothing
in
*NL*
it
.
The
man
you
are
thinking
of
is
no
better
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
as
good
as
he
you
would
leave
me
!
''
she
cried
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unluckily
aroused
Henchard
.
``
You
can
not
in
honour
refuse
me
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
And
unless
you
give
me
your
promise
this
very
night
to
be
my
*NL*
wife
,
before
a
witness
,
I
'll
reveal
our
intimacy
--
in
common
fairness
to
*NL*
other
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
look
of
resignation
settled
upon
her
.
Henchard
saw
its
bitterness
;
*NL*
and
had
Lucetta
's
heart
been
given
to
any
other
man
in
the
world
than
*NL*
Farfrae
he
would
probably
have
had
pity
upon
her
at
that
moment
.
But
the
*NL*
supplanter
was
the
upstart
-LRB-
as
Henchard
called
him
-RRB-
who
had
mounted
into
*NL*
prominence
upon
his
shoulders
,
and
he
could
bring
himself
to
show
no
*NL*
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
another
word
she
rang
the
bell
,
and
directed
that
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
should
be
fetched
from
her
room
.
The
latter
appeared
,
surprised
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
her
lucubrations
.
As
soon
as
she
saw
Henchard
she
went
across
*NL*
to
him
dutifully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth-Jane
,
''
he
said
,
taking
her
hand
,
``
I
want
you
to
hear
this
.
''
*NL*
And
turning
to
Lucetta
:
``
Will
you
,
or
will
you
not
,
marry
me
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
--
wish
it
,
I
must
agree
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
she
given
the
promise
than
she
fell
back
in
a
fainting
*NL*
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dreadful
thing
drives
her
to
say
this
,
father
,
when
it
is
such
a
*NL*
pain
to
her
?
''
asked
Elizabeth
,
kneeling
down
by
Lucetta
.
``
Do
n't
compel
*NL*
her
to
do
anything
against
her
will
!
I
have
lived
with
her
,
and
know
*NL*
that
she
can
not
bear
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
a
no
`
thern
simpleton
!
''
said
Henchard
drily
.
``
This
promise
will
*NL*
leave
him
free
for
you
,
if
you
want
him
,
wo
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Lucetta
seemed
to
wake
from
her
swoon
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
?
Who
are
you
talking
about
?
''
she
said
wildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
''
said
Elizabeth
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
well
.
Then
it
is
my
mistake
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
But
the
business
is
*NL*
between
me
and
Miss
Templeman
.
She
agrees
to
be
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
dwell
on
it
just
now
,
''
entreated
Elizabeth
,
holding
Lucetta
's
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
,
if
she
promises
,
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
I
have
,
''
groaned
Lucetta
,
her
limbs
hanging
like
fluid
,
from
*NL*
very
misery
and
faintness
.
``
Michael
,
please
do
n't
argue
it
any
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
,
''
he
said
.
And
taking
up
his
hat
he
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
continued
to
kneel
by
Lucetta
.
``
What
is
this
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
You
called
my
father
`
Michael
'
as
if
you
knew
him
well
?
And
how
is
it
*NL*
he
has
got
this
power
over
you
,
that
you
promise
to
marry
him
against
*NL*
your
will
?
Ah
--
you
have
many
many
secrets
from
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
have
some
from
me
,
''
Lucetta
murmured
with
closed
eyes
,
*NL*
little
thinking
,
however
,
so
unsuspicious
was
she
,
that
the
secret
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
heart
concerned
the
young
man
who
had
caused
this
damage
to
*NL*
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
--
do
anything
against
you
at
all
!
''
stammered
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
keeping
in
all
signs
of
emotion
till
she
was
ready
to
burst
.
``
I
can
not
*NL*
understand
how
my
father
can
command
you
so
;
I
do
n't
sympathize
with
him
*NL*
in
it
at
all
.
I
'll
go
to
him
and
ask
him
to
release
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

said
Lucetta
.
``
Let
it
all
be

The
next
morning
Henchard
went
to
the
Town
Hall
below
Lucetta
's
house
,
*NL*
to
attend
Petty
Sessions
,
being
still
a
magistrate
for
the
year
by
*NL*
virtue
of
his
late
position
as
Mayor
.
In
passing
he
looked
up
at
her
*NL*
windows
,
but
nothing
of
her
was
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
as
a
Justice
of
the
Peace
may
at
first
seem
to
be
an
even
*NL*
greater
incongruity
than
Shallow
and
Silence
themselves
.
But
his
rough
*NL*
and
ready
perceptions
,
his
sledge-hammer
directness
,
had
often
served
*NL*
him
better
than
nice
legal
knowledge
in
despatching
such
simple
business
*NL*
as
fell
to
his
hands
in
this
Court
.
To-day
Dr.
Chalkfield
,
the
Mayor
for
*NL*
the
year
,
being
absent
,
the
corn-merchant
took
the
big
chair
,
his
eyes
*NL*
still
abstractedly
stretching
out
of
the
window
to
the
ashlar
front
of
*NL*
High-Place
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
case
only
,
and
the
offender
stood
before
him
.
She
was
an
*NL*
old
woman
of
mottled
countenance
,
attired
in
a
shawl
of
that
nameless
*NL*
tertiary
hue
which
comes
,
but
can
not
be
made
--
a
hue
neither
tawny
,
*NL*
russet
,
hazel
,
nor
ash
;
a
sticky
black
bonnet
that
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
worn
in
the
country
of
the
Psalmist
where
the
clouds
drop
fatness
;
and
*NL*
an
apron
that
had
been
white
in
time
so
comparatively
recent
as
still
to
*NL*
contrast
visibly
with
the
rest
of
her
clothes
.
The
steeped
aspect
of
the
*NL*
woman
as
a
whole
showed
her
to
be
no
native
of
the
country-side
or
even
*NL*
of
a
country-town
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
cursorily
at
Henchard
and
the
second
magistrate
,
and
Henchard
*NL*
looked
at
her
,
with
a
momentary
pause
,
as
if
she
had
reminded
him
*NL*
indistinctly
of
somebody
or
something
which
passed
from
his
mind
as
*NL*
quickly
as
it
had
come
.
``
Well
,
and
what
has
she
been
doing
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
looking
down
at
the
charge
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
charged
,
sir
,
with
the
offence
of
disorderly
female
and
*NL*
nuisance
,
''
whispered
Stubberd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
she
do
that
?
''
said
the
other

of

the

the
act

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
back
then

''
said
Henchard
,
``
and
let
's
hear
what
you
've
got
to
*NL*
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stubberd
was
sworn
in
,
the
magistrate
's
clerk
dipped
his
pen
,
Henchard
*NL*
being
no
note-taker
himself
,
and
the
constable
began
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hearing
a
'
illegal
noise
I
went
down
the
street
at
twenty-five
minutes
*NL*
past
eleven
P.M.
on
the
night
of
the
fifth
instinct
,
Hannah
Dominy
.
When
*NL*
I
had

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
so
fast
,
Stubberd
,
''
said
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
waited
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
clerk
's
pen
,
till
the
latter
*NL*
stopped
scratching
and
said
,
``
yes
.
''
Stubberd
continued
:
``
When
I
had
*NL*
proceeded
to
the
spot
I
saw
defendant
at
another
spot
,
namely
,
the
*NL*
gutter
.
''
He
paused
,
watching
the
point
of
the
clerk
's
pen
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gutter
,
yes
,
Stubberd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spot
measuring
twelve
feet
nine
inches
or
thereabouts
from
where
I
--
''
*NL*
Still
careful
not
to
outrun
the
clerk
's
penmanship
Stubberd
pulled
up
*NL*
again
;
for
having
got
his
evidence
by
heart
it
was
immaterial
to
him
*NL*
whereabouts
he
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
object
to
that
,
''
spoke
up
the
old
woman
,
''
`
spot
measuring
twelve
feet
*NL*
nine
or
thereabouts
from
where
I
,
'
is
not
sound
testimony
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrates
consulted
,
and
the
second
one
said
that
the
bench
was
*NL*
of
opinion
that
twelve
feet
nine
inches
from
a
man
on
his
oath
was
*NL*
admissible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stubberd
,
with
a
suppressed
gaze
of
victorious
rectitude
at
the
old
*NL*
woman
,
continued
:
``
Was
standing
myself
.
She
was
wambling
about
quite
*NL*
dangerous
to
the
thoroughfare
and
when
I
approached
to
draw
near
she
*NL*
committed
the
nuisance
,
and
insulted
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Insulted
me
.
'
...
Yes
,
what
did
she
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
,
`
Put
away
that
dee
lantern
,
'
she
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Says
she
,
`
Dost
hear
,
old
turmit-head
?
Put
away
that
dee
lantern
.
I
*NL*
have
floored
fellows
a
dee
sight
finer-looking
than
a

fool
like
*NL*
thee
,
you
son
of
a
bee
,
dee
me
if
I
haint
,
'
she
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
object
to
that
conversation
!
''
interposed
the
old
woman
.
``
I
was
not
*NL*
capable
enough
to
hear
what
I
said
,
and
what
is
said
out
of
my
hearing
*NL*
is
not
evidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
stoppage
for
consultation
,
a
book
was
referred
to
,
and
*NL*
finally
Stubberd
was
allowed
to
go
on
again
.
The
truth
was
that
the
*NL*
old
woman
had
appeared
in
court
so
many
more
times
than
the
magistrates
*NL*
themselves
,
that
they
were
obliged
to
keep
a
sharp
look-out
upon
their
*NL*
procedure
.
However
,
when
Stubberd
had
rambled
on
a
little
further
*NL*
Henchard
broke
out
impatiently
,
``
Come
--
we
do
n't
want
to
hear
any
more
of
*NL*
them
cust
dees
and
bees
!
Say
the
words
out
like
a
man
,
and
do
n't
be
so
*NL*
modest
,
Stubberd
;
or
else
leave
it
alone
!
''
Turning
to
the
woman
,
``
Now
*NL*
then
,
have
you
any
questions
to
ask
him
,
or
anything
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
;
and
the
clerk
dipped
his
*NL*
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
years
ago
or
thereabout
I
was
selling
of
furmity
in
a
tent
at
*NL*
Weydon
Fair
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twenty
years
ago
'
--
well
,
that
's
beginning
at
the
beginning
;
suppose
*NL*
you
go
back
to
the
Creation
!
''
said
the
clerk
,
not
without
satire
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Henchard
stared
,
and
quite
forgot
what
was
evidence
and
what
was
*NL*
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
and
a
woman
with
a
little
child
came
into
my
tent
,
''
the
woman
*NL*
continued
.
``
They
sat
down
and
had
a
basin
apiece
.
Ah
,
Lord
's
my
life
!
I
*NL*
was
of
a
more
respectable
station
in
the
world
then
than
I
am
now
,
being
*NL*
a
land
smuggler
in
a
large
way
of
business
;
and
I
used
to
season
my
*NL*
furmity
with
rum
for
them
who
asked
for
`
t.
I
did
it
for
the
man
;
and
*NL*
then
he
had
more
and
more
;
till
at
last
he
quarrelled
with
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
offered
to
sell
her
to
the
highest
bidder
.
A
sailor
came
in
and
bid
five
*NL*
guineas
,
and
paid
the
money
,
and
led
her
away
.
And
the
man
who
sold
his
*NL*
wife
in
that
fashion
is
the
man
sitting
there
in
the
great
big
chair
.
''
*NL*
The
speaker
concluded
by
nodding
her
head
at
Henchard
and
folding
her
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
looked
at
Henchard
.
His
face
seemed
strange
,
and
in
tint
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
powdered
over
with
ashes
.
``
We
do
n't
want
to
hear
your
life
*NL*
and
adventures
,
''
said
the
second
magistrate
sharply
,
filling
the
pause
*NL*
which
followed
.
``
You
've
been
asked
if
you
've
anything
to
say
bearing
on
*NL*
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
bears
on
the
case
.
It
proves
that
he
's
no
better
than
I
,
and
has
*NL*
no
right
to
sit
there
in
judgment
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
concocted
story
,
''
said
the
clerk
.
``
So
hold
your
tongue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
't
is
true
.
''
The
words
came
from
Henchard
.
''
'T
is
as
true
as
the
*NL*
light
,
''
he
said
slowly
.
``
And
upon
my
soul
it
does
prove
that
I
'm
no
*NL*
better
than
she
!
And
to
keep
out
of
any
temptation
to
treat
her
hard
for
*NL*
her
revenge
,
I
'll
leave
her
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sensation
in
the
court
was
indescribably
great
.
Henchard
left
the
*NL*
chair
,
and
came
out
,
passing
through
a
group
of
people
on
the
steps
*NL*
and
outside
that
was
much
larger
than
usual
;
for
it
seemed
that
the
old
*NL*
furmity
dealer
had
mysteriously
hinted
to
the
denizens
of
the
lane
in
*NL*
which
she
had
been
lodging
since
her
arrival
,
that
she
knew
a
queer
*NL*
thing
or
two
about
their
great
local
man
Mr.
Henchard
,
if
she
chose
to
*NL*
tell
it
.
This
had
brought
them
hither
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
there
so
many
idlers
round
the
Town
Hall
to-day
?
''
said
Lucetta
*NL*
to
her
servant
when
the
case
was
over
.
She
had
risen
late
,
and
had
just
*NL*
looked
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
ma'am
,
't
is
this
larry
about
Mr.
Henchard
.
A
woman
has
*NL*
proved
that
before
he
became
a
gentleman
he
sold
his
wife
for
five
*NL*
guineas
in
a
booth
at
a
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
accounts
which
Henchard
had
given
her
of
the
separation
from
*NL*
his
wife
Susan
for
so
many
years
,
of
his
belief
in
her
death
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
he
had
never
clearly
explained
the
actual
and
immediate
cause
of
that
*NL*
separation
.
The
story
she
now
heard
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gradual
misery
overspread
Lucetta
's
face
as
she
dwelt
upon
the
promise
*NL*
wrung
from
her
the
night
before
.
At
bottom
,
then
,
Henchard
was
this
.
*NL*
How
terrible
a
contingency
for
a
woman
who
should
commit
herself
to
his
*NL*
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
day
she
went
out
to
the
Ring
and
to
other
places
,
not
coming
*NL*
in
till
nearly
dusk
.
As
soon
as
she
saw
Elizabeth-Jane
after
her
return
*NL*
indoors
she
told
her
that
she
had
resolved
to
go
away
from
home
to
the
*NL*
seaside
for
a
few
days
--
to
Port-Bredy
;
Casterbridge
was
so
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
seeing
that
she
looked
wan
and
disturbed
,
encouraged
her
in
*NL*
the
idea
,
thinking
a
change
would
afford
her
relief
.
She
could
not
help
*NL*
suspecting
that
the
gloom
which
seemed
to
have
come
over
Casterbridge
*NL*
in
Lucetta
's
eyes
might
be
partially
owing
to
the
fact
that
Farfrae
was
*NL*
away
from
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
saw
her
friend
depart
for
Port-Bredy
,
and
took
charge
of
*NL*
High-Place
Hall
till
her
return
.
After
two
or
three
days
of
solitude
and
*NL*
incessant
rain
Henchard
called
at
the
house
.
He
seemed
disappointed
to
*NL*
hear
of
Lucetta
's
absence
and
though
he
nodded
with
outward
indifference
*NL*
he
went
away
handling
his
beard
with
a
nettled
mien
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
called
again
.
``
Is
she
come
now
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
returned
this
morning
,
''
replied
his
stepdaughter
.
``
But
she
*NL*
is
not
indoors
.
She
has
gone
for
a
walk
along
the
turnpike-road
to
*NL*
Port-Bredy
.
She
will
be
home
by
dusk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
words
,
which
only
served
to
reveal
his
restless
impatience
,
*NL*
he
left
the
house
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
29
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
hour
Lucetta
was
bounding
along
the
road
to
Port-Bredy
just
as
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
announced
.
That
she
had
chosen
for
her
afternoon
walk
the
*NL*
road
along
which
she
had
returned
to
Casterbridge
three
hours
earlier
*NL*
in
a
carriage
was
curious
--
if
anything
should
be
called
curious
in
*NL*
concatenations
of
phenomena
wherein
each
is
known
to
have
its
accounting
*NL*
cause
.
It
was
the
day
of
the
chief
market
--
Saturday
--
and
Farfrae
*NL*
for
once
had
been
missed
from
his
corn-stand
in
the
dealers
'
room
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
it
was
known
that
he
would
be
home
that
night
--
``
for
*NL*
Sunday
,
''
as
Casterbridge
expressed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
,
in
continuing
her
walk
,
had
at
length
reached
the
end
of
the
*NL*
ranked
trees
which
bordered
the
highway
in
this
and
other
directions
out
*NL*
of
the
town
.
This
end
marked
a
mile
;
and
here
she
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spot
was
a
vale
between
two
gentle
acclivities
,
and
the
road
,
*NL*
still
adhering
to
its
Roman
foundation
,
stretched
onward
straight
as
a
*NL*
surveyor
's
line
till
lost
to
sight
on
the
most
distant
ridge
.
There
was
*NL*
neither
hedge
nor
tree
in
the
prospect
now
,
the
road
clinging
to
the
*NL*
stubby
expanse
of
corn-land
like
a
strip
to
an
undulating
garment
.
Near
*NL*
her
was
a
barn
--
the
single
building
of
any
kind
within
her
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
strained
her
eyes
up
the
lessening
road
,
but
nothing
appeared
*NL*
thereon
--
not
so
much
as
a
speck
.
She
sighed
one
word
--
``
Donald
!
''
and
*NL*
turned
her
face
to
the
town
for
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
case
was
different
.
A
single
figure
was
approaching
*NL*
her
--
Elizabeth-Jane
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
,
in
spite
of
her
loneliness
,
seemed
a
little
vexed
.
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
face
,
as
soon
as
she
recognized
her
friend
,
shaped
itself
into
*NL*
affectionate
lines
while
yet
beyond
speaking
distance
.
``
I
suddenly
*NL*
thought
I
would
come
and
meet
you
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
's
reply
was
taken
from
her
lips
by
an
unexpected
diversion
.
A
*NL*
by-road
on
her
right
hand
descended
from
the
fields
into
the
highway
*NL*
at
the
point
where
she
stood
,
and
down
the
track
a
bull
was
rambling
*NL*
uncertainly
towards
her
and
Elizabeth
,
who
,
facing
the
other
way
,
did
*NL*
not
observe
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
latter
quarter
of
each
year
cattle
were
at
once
the
mainstay
and
*NL*
the
terror
of
families
about
Casterbridge
and
its
neighbourhood
,
where
*NL*
breeding
was
carried
on
with
Abrahamic
success
.
The
head
of
stock
*NL*
driven
into
and
out
of
the
town
at
this
season
to
be
sold
by
the
local
*NL*
auctioneer
was
very
large
;
and
all
these
horned
beasts
,
in
travelling
to
*NL*
and
fro
,
sent
women
and
children
to
shelter
as
nothing
else
could
do
.
*NL*
In
the
main
the
animals
would
have
walked
along
quietly
enough
;
but
the
*NL*
Casterbridge
tradition
was
that
to
drive
stock
it
was
indispensable
that
*NL*
hideous
cries
,
coupled
with
Yahoo
antics
and
gestures
,
should
be
used
,
*NL*
large
sticks
flourished
,
stray
dogs
called
in
,
and
in
general
everything
*NL*
done
that
was
likely
to
infuriate
the
viciously
disposed
and
terrify
the
*NL*
mild
.
Nothing
was
commoner
than
for
a
house-holder
on
going
out
of
his
*NL*
parlour
to
find
his
hall
or
passage
full
of
little
children
,
nursemaids
,
*NL*
aged
women
,
or
a
ladies
'
school
,
who
apologized
for
their
presence
by
*NL*
saying
,
``
A
bull
passing
down
street
from
the
sale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
and
Elizabeth
regarded
the
animal
in
doubt
,
he
meanwhile
drawing
*NL*
vaguely
towards
them
.
It
was
a
large
specimen
of
the
breed
,
in
colour
*NL*
rich
dun
,
though
disfigured
at
present
by
splotches
of
mud
about
*NL*
his
seamy
sides
.
His
horns
were
thick
and
tipped
with
brass
;
his
two
*NL*
nostrils
like
the
Thames
Tunnel
as
seen
in
the
perspective
toys
of
yore
.
*NL*
Between
them
,
through
the
gristle
of
his
nose
,
was
a
stout
copper
ring
,
*NL*
welded
on
,
and
irremovable
as
Gurth
's
collar
of
brass
.
To
the
ring
was
*NL*
attached
an
ash
staff
about
a
yard
long
,
which
the
bull
with
the
motions
*NL*
of
his
head
flung
about
like
a
flail
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
they
observed
this
dangling
stick
that
the
young
women
*NL*
were
really
alarmed
;
for
it
revealed
to
them
that
the
bull
was
an
old
*NL*
one
,
too
savage
to
be
driven
,
which
had
in
some
way
escaped
,
the
staff
*NL*
being
the
means
by
which
the
drover
controlled
him
and
kept
his
horns
at
*NL*
arms
'
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
round
for
some
shelter
or
hiding-place
,
and
thought
of
the
*NL*
barn
hard
by
.
As
long
as
they
had
kept
their
eyes
on
the
bull
he
had
*NL*
shown
some
deference
in
his
manner
of
approach
;
but
no
sooner
did
they
*NL*
turn
their
backs
to
seek
the
barn
than
he
tossed
his
head
and
decided
*NL*
to
thoroughly
terrify
them
.
This
caused
the
two
helpless
girls
to
run
*NL*
wildly
,
whereupon
the
bull
advanced
in
a
deliberate
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barn
stood
behind
a
green
slimy
pond
,
and
it
was
closed
save
as
to
*NL*
one
of
the
usual
pair
of
doors
facing
them
,
which
had
been
propped
open
*NL*
by
a
hurdle-stick
,
and
for
this
opening
they
made
.
The
interior
had
been
*NL*
cleared
by
a
recent
bout
of
threshing
except
at
one
end
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
stack
of
dry
clover
.
Elizabeth-Jane
took
in
the
situation
.
``
We
must
*NL*
climb
up
there
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
they
had
even
approached
it
they
heard
the
bull
scampering
*NL*
through
the
pond
without
,
and
in
a
second
he
dashed
into
the
barn
,
*NL*
knocking
down
the
hurdle-stake
in
passing
;
the
heavy
door
slammed
behind
*NL*
him
;
and
all
three
were
imprisoned
in
the
barn
together
.
The
mistaken
*NL*
creature
saw
them
,
and
stalked
towards
the
end
of
the
barn
into
which
*NL*
they
had
fled
.
The
girls
doubled
so
adroitly
that
their
pursuer
was
*NL*
against
the
wall
when
the
fugitives
were
already
half
way
to
the
other
*NL*
end
.
By
the
time
that
his
length
would
allow
him
to
turn
and
follow
them
*NL*
thither
they
had
crossed
over
;
thus
the
pursuit
went
on
,
the
hot
air
*NL*
from
his
nostrils
blowing
over
them
like
a
sirocco
,
and
not
a
moment
*NL*
being
attainable
by
Elizabeth
or
Lucetta
in
which
to
open
the
door
.
What
*NL*
might
have
happened
had
their
situation
continued
can
not
be
said
;
but
*NL*
in
a
few
moments
a
rattling
of
the
door
distracted
their
adversary
's
*NL*
attention
,
and
a
man
appeared
.
He
ran
forward
towards
the
leading-staff
,
*NL*
seized
it
,
and
wrenched
the
animal
's
head
as
if
he
would
snap
it
off
.
*NL*
The
wrench
was
in
reality
so
violent
that
the
thick
neck
seemed
to
have
*NL*
lost
its
stiffness
and
to
become
half-paralyzed
,
whilst
the
nose
dropped
*NL*
blood
.
The
premeditated
human
contrivance
of
the
nose-ring
was
too
*NL*
cunning
for
impulsive
brute
force
,
and
the
creature
flinched
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
seen
in
the
partial
gloom
to
be
large-framed
and
*NL*
unhesitating
.
He
led
the
bull
to
the
door
,
and
the
light
revealed
*NL*
Henchard
.
He
made
the
bull
fast
without
,
and
re-entered
to
the
succour
*NL*
of
Lucetta
;
for
he
had
not
perceived
Elizabeth
,
who
had
climbed
on
to
*NL*
the
clover-heap
.
Lucetta
was
hysterical
,
and
Henchard
took
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
have
saved
me
!
''
she
cried
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
returned
your
kindness
,
''
he
responded
tenderly
.
``
You
once
saved
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
comes
it
to
be
you
--
you
?
''
she
asked
,
not
heeding
his
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
out
here
to
look
for
you
.
I
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you
*NL*
something
these
two
or
three
days
;
but
you
have
been
away
,
and
I
could
*NL*
not
.
Perhaps
you
can
not
talk
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
no
!
Where
is
Elizabeth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
am
I
!
''
cried
the
missing
one
cheerfully
;
and
without
waiting
for
*NL*
the
ladder
to
be
placed
she
slid
down
the
face
of
the
clover-stack
to
*NL*
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
supporting
Lucetta
on
one
side
,
and
Elizabeth-Jane
on
the
*NL*
other
,
they
went
slowly
along
the
rising
road
.
They
had
reached
the
top
*NL*
and
were
descending
again
when
Lucetta
,
now
much
recovered
,
recollected
*NL*
that
she
had
dropped
her
muff
in
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
back
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
it
at
all
,
as
I
am
*NL*
not
tired
as
you
are
.
''
She
thereupon
hastened
down
again
to
the
barn
,
*NL*
the
others
pursuing
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
soon
found
the
muff
,
such
an
article
being
by
no
means
small
*NL*
at
that
time
.
Coming
out
she
paused
to
look
for
a
moment
at
the
bull
,
*NL*
now
rather
to
be
pitied
with
his
bleeding
nose
,
having
perhaps
rather
*NL*
intended
a
practical
joke
than
a
murder
.
Henchard
had
secured
him
by
*NL*
jamming
the
staff
into
the
hinge
of
the
barn-door
,
and
wedging
it
*NL*
there
with
a
stake
.
At
length
she
turned
to
hasten
onward
after
her
*NL*
contemplation
,
when
she
saw
a
green-and-black
gig
approaching
from
the
*NL*
contrary
direction
,
the
vehicle
being
driven
by
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
presence
here
seemed
to
explain
Lucetta
's
walk
that
way
.
Donald
saw
*NL*
her
,
drew
up
,
and
was
hastily
made
acquainted
with
what
had
occurred
.
At
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
mentioning
how
greatly
Lucetta
had
been
jeopardized
,
he
*NL*
exhibited
an
agitation
different
in
kind
no
less
than
in
intensity
*NL*
from
any
she
had
seen
in
him
before
.
He
became
so
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
circumstance
that
he
scarcely
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
to
think
of
helping
her
up
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
gone
on
with
Mr.
Henchard
,
you
say
?
''
he
inquired
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
is
taking
her
home
.
They
are
almost
there
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
sure
she
can
get
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
was
quite
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
stepfather
saved
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Entirely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
checked
his
horse
's
pace
;
she
guessed
why
.
He
was
thinking
that
*NL*
it
would
be
best
not
to
intrude
on
the
other
two
just
now
.
Henchard
*NL*
had
saved
Lucetta
,
and
to
provoke
a
possible
exhibition
of
her
deeper
*NL*
affection
for
himself
was
as
ungenerous
as
it
was
unwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
immediate
subject
of
their
talk
being
exhausted
she
felt
more
*NL*
embarrassed
at
sitting
thus
beside
her
past
lover
;
but
soon
the
two
*NL*
figures
of
the
others
were
visible
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
.
The
face
*NL*
of
the
woman
was
frequently
turned
back
,
but
Farfrae
did
not
whip
on
the
*NL*
horse
.
When
these
reached
the
town
walls
Henchard
and
his
companion
*NL*
had
disappeared
down
the
street
;
Farfrae
set
down
Elizabeth-Jane
on
her
*NL*
expressing
a
particular
wish
to
alight
there
,
and
drove
round
to
the
*NL*
stables
at
the
back
of
his
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
account
he
entered
the
house
through
his
garden
,
and
going
up
to
*NL*
his
apartments
found
them
in
a
particularly
disturbed
state
,
his
boxes
*NL*
being
hauled
out
upon
the
landing
,
and
his
bookcase
standing
in
three
*NL*
pieces
.
These
phenomena
,
however
,
seemed
to
cause
him
not
the
least
*NL*
surprise
.
``
When
will
everything
be
sent
up
?
''
he
said
to
the
mistress
of
*NL*
the
house
,
who
was
superintending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
not
before
eight
,
sir
,
''
said
she
.
``
You
see
we
was
n't
aware
*NL*
till
this
morning
that
you
were
going
to
move
,
or
we
could
have
been
*NL*
forwarder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
--
well
,
never
mind
,
never
mind
!
''
said
Farfrae
cheerily
.
``
Eight
o'clock
*NL*
will
do
well
enough
if
it
be
not
later
.
Now
,
do
n't
ye
be
standing
here
*NL*
talking
,
or
it
will
be
twelve
,
I
doubt
.
''
Thus
speaking
he
went
out
by
*NL*
the
front
door
and
up
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
interval
Henchard
and
Lucetta
had
had
experiences
of
*NL*
a
different
kind
.
After
Elizabeth
's
departure
for
the
muff
the
*NL*
corn-merchant
opened
himself
frankly
,
holding
her
hand
within
his
arm
,
*NL*
though
she
would
fain
have
withdrawn
it
.
``
Dear
Lucetta
,
I
have
been
*NL*
very
,
very
anxious
to
see
you
these
two
or
three
days
,
''
he
said
,
``
ever
*NL*
since
I
saw
you
last
!
I
have
thought
over
the
way
I
got
your
promise
*NL*
that
night
.
You
said
to
me
,
`
If
I
were
a
man
I
should
not
insist
.
'
That
*NL*
cut
me
deep
.
I
felt
that
there
was
some
truth
in
it
.
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
make
you
wretched
;
and
to
marry
me
just
now
would
do
that
as
nothing
*NL*
else
could
--
it
is
but
too
plain
.
Therefore
I
agree
to
an
indefinite
*NL*
engagement
--
to
put
off
all
thought
of
marriage
for
a
year
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
can
I
do
nothing
of
a
different
kind
?
''
said
Lucetta
.
``
I
am
*NL*
full
of
gratitude
to
you
--
you
have
saved
my
life
.
And
your
care
of
me
is
*NL*
like
coals
of
fire
on
my
head
!
I
am
a
monied
person
now
.
Surely
I
can
do
*NL*
something
in
return
for
your
goodness
--
something
practical
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
remained
in
thought
.
He
had
evidently
not
expected
this
.
``
There
*NL*
is
one
thing
you
might
do
,
Lucetta
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
not
exactly
of
that
*NL*
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
of
what
kind
is
it
?
''
she
asked
with
renewed
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
a
secret
to
ask
it
.
--
You
may
have
heard
that
I
have
*NL*
been
unlucky
this
year
?
I
did
what
I
have
never
done
before
--
speculated
*NL*
rashly
;
and
I
lost
.
That
's
just
put
me
in
a
strait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
wish
me
to
advance
some
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
said
Henchard
,
almost
in
anger
.
``
I
'm
not
the
man
to
sponge
on
*NL*
a
woman
,
even
though
she
may
be
so
nearly
my
own
as
you
.
No
,
Lucetta
;
*NL*
what
you
can
do
is
this
and
it
would
save
me
.
My
great
creditor
is
*NL*
Grower
,
and
it
is
at
his
hands
I
shall
suffer
if
at
anybody
's
;
while
a
*NL*
fortnight
's
forbearance
on
his
part
would
be
enough
to
allow
me
to
pull
*NL*
through
.
This
may
be
got
out
of
him
in
one
way
--
that
you
would
let
it
be
*NL*
known
to
him
that
you
are
my
intended
--
that
we
are
to
be
quietly
married
*NL*
in
the
next
fortnight
.
--
Now
stop
,
you
have
n't
heard
all
!
Let
him
have
*NL*
this
story
,
without
,
of
course
,
any
prejudice
to
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
actual
engagement
between
us
is
to
be
a
long
one
.
Nobody
else
need
know
:
*NL*
you
could
go
with
me
to
Mr.
Grower
and
just
let
me
speak
to
`
ee
before
*NL*
him
as
if
we
were
on
such
terms
.
We
'll
ask
him
to
keep
it
secret
.
He
*NL*
will
willingly
wait
then
.
At
the
fortnight
's
end
I
shall
be
able
to
face
*NL*
him
;
and
I
can
coolly
tell
him
all
is
postponed
between
us
for
a
year
*NL*
or
two
.
Not
a
soul
in
the
town
need
know
how
you
've
helped
me
.
Since
you
*NL*
wish
to
be
of
use
,
there
's
your
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
now
what
the
people
called
the
``
pinking
in
''
of
the
day
,
that
*NL*
is
,
the
quarter-hour
just
before
dusk
,
he
did
not
at
first
observe
the
*NL*
result
of
his
own
words
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
anything
else
,
''
she
began
,
and
the
dryness
of
her
lips
was
*NL*
represented
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
such
a
little
thing
!
''
he
said
,
with
a
deep
reproach
.
``
Less
*NL*
than
you
have
offered
--
just
the
beginning
of
what
you
have
so
lately
*NL*
promised

I
could
have
told
him
as
much
myself

but
he
would
not

believed
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not

I

I
absolutely

she
said
,
*NL*
with
rising
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
provoking
!
''
he
burst
out
.
``
It
is
enough
to
make
me
force
you
to
*NL*
carry
out
at
once
what
you
have
promised

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not

she
insisted
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

When
I
have
only
within
these
few
minutes
released
you
from
your

I

We

married
this

at
Port-Bredy

There
were
reasons

Mr.
Grower
was
a
witness
because
he
happened
to
be
at
Port-Bredy
*NL*
at
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
stood
as
if
idiotized
.
She
was
so
alarmed
at
his
silence
that
*NL*
she
murmured
something
about
lending
him
sufficient
money
to
tide
over
*NL*
the
perilous
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Married
him
?
''
said
Henchard
at
length
.
``
My
good
--
what
,
married
him
*NL*
whilst
--
bound
to
marry
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
like
this
,
''
she
explained
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
quavers
*NL*
in
her
voice
;
``
do
n't
--
do
n't
be
cruel
!
I
loved
him
so
much
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
you
might
tell
him
of
the
past
--
and
that
grieved
me
!
And
then
,
when
I
*NL*
had
promised
you
,
I
learnt
of
the
rumour
that
you
had
--
sold
your
first
*NL*
wife
at
a
fair
like
a
horse
or
cow
!
How
could
I
keep
my
promise
after
*NL*
hearing
that
?
I
could
not
risk
myself
in
your
hands
;
it
would
have
been
*NL*
letting
myself
down
to
take
your
name
after
such
a
scandal
.
But
I
knew
I
*NL*
should
lose
Donald
if
I
did
not
secure
him
at
once
--
for
you
would
carry
*NL*
out
your
threat
of
telling
him
of
our
former
acquaintance
,
as
long
as
*NL*
there
was
a
chance
of
keeping
me
for
yourself
by
doing
so
.
But
you
will
*NL*
not
do
so
now
,
will
you
,
Michael
?
for
it
is
too
late
to
separate
us
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
notes
of
St.
Peter
's
bells
in
full
peal
had
been
wafted
to
them
*NL*
while
he
spoke
,
and
now
the
genial
thumping
of
the
town
band
,
renowned
*NL*
for
its
unstinted
use
of
the
drum-stick
,
throbbed
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
this
racket
they
are
making
is
on
account
of
it
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
think
he
has
told
them
,

else
Mr.
Grower
has
...
May
I
leave
*NL*
you
now
?
My
--
he
was
detained
at
Port-Bredy
to-day
,
and
sent
me
on
a
few
*NL*
hours
before
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
HIS

have
saved
this
afternoon

I
am
much
obliged

him

false

burst
from
Henchard
.
*NL*
``
You
promised
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

But
it
was
under
compulsion

I
did
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I

a

``
A
pensioner
of

*NL*
*NL*
She
disappeared
under
the
trees
of
the
south
walk
as
the
band
came
round
*NL*
the
corner
,
awaking
the
echoes
of
every
stock
and
stone
in
celebration
*NL*
of
her
happiness
.
Lucetta
took
no
heed
,
but
ran
up
the
back
street
and
*NL*
reached
her
own
home
unperceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
30
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
's
words
to
his
landlady
had
referred
to
the
removal
of
his
boxes
*NL*
and
other
effects
from
his
late
lodgings
to
Lucetta
's
house
.
The
work
*NL*
was
not
heavy
,
but
it
had
been
much
hindered
on
account
of
the
frequent
*NL*
pauses
necessitated
by
exclamations
of
surprise
at
the
event
,
of
which
*NL*
the
good
woman
had
been
briefly
informed
by
letter
a
few
hours
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
last
moment
of
leaving
Port-Bredy
,
Farfrae
,
like
John
Gilpin
,
*NL*
had
been
detained
by
important
customers
,
whom
,
even
in
the
exceptional
*NL*
circumstances
,
he
was
not
the
man
to
neglect
.
Moreover
,
there
was
a
*NL*
convenience
in
Lucetta
arriving
first
at
her
house
.
Nobody
there
as
yet
*NL*
knew
what
had
happened
;
and
she
was
best
in
a
position
to
break
the
news
*NL*
to
the
inmates
,
and
give
directions
for
her
husband
's
accommodation
.
He
*NL*
had
,
therefore
,
sent
on
his
two-days
'
bride
in
a
hired
brougham
,
whilst
*NL*
he
went
across
the
country
to
a
certain
group
of
wheat
and
barley
ricks
*NL*
a
few
miles
off
,
telling
her
the
hour
at
which
he
might
be
expected
*NL*
the
same
evening
.
This
accounted
for
her
trotting
out
to
meet
him
after
*NL*
their
separation
of
four
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
strenuous
effort
,
after
leaving
Henchard
she
calmed
herself
in
*NL*
readiness
to
receive
Donald
at
High-Place
Hall
when
he
came
on
from
his
*NL*
lodgings
.
One
supreme
fact
empowered
her
to
this
,
the
sense
that
,
come
*NL*
what
would
,
she
had
secured
him
.
Half-an-hour
after
her
arrival
he
*NL*
walked
in
,
and
she
met
him
with
a
relieved
gladness
,
which
a
month
's
*NL*
perilous
absence
could
not
have
intensified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
thing
I
have
not
done
;
and
yet
it
is
important
,
''
she
said
*NL*
earnestly
,
when
she
had
finished
talking
about
the
adventure
with
*NL*
the
bull
.
``
That
is
,
broken
the
news
of
our
marriage
to
my
dear
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
and
you
have
not
?
''
he
said
thoughtfully
.
``
I
gave
her
a
lift
from
*NL*
the
barn
homewards
;
but
I
did
not
tell
her
either
;
for
I
thought
*NL*
she
might
have
heard
of
it
in
the
town
,
and
was
keeping
back
her
*NL*
congratulations
from
shyness
,
and
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
can
hardly
have
heard
of
it
.
But
I
'll
find
out
;
I
'll
go
to
her
*NL*
now
.
And
,
Donald
,
you
do
n't
mind
her
living
on
with
me
just
the
same
as
*NL*
before
?
She
is
so
quiet
and
unassuming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
indeed
I
do
n't
,
''
Farfrae
answered
with
,
perhaps
,
a
faint
*NL*
awkwardness
.
``
But
I
wonder
if
she
would
care
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
!
''
said
Lucetta
eagerly
.
``
I
am
sure
she
would
like
to
.
Besides
,
*NL*
poor
thing
,
she
has
no
other
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
did
not
suspect
the
secret
of
*NL*
her
more
reserved
friend
.
He
liked
her
all
the
better
for
the
blindness
.
*NL*
``
Arrange
as
you
like
with
her
by
all
means
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
is
I
who
have
*NL*
come
to
your
house
,
not
you
to
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
and
speak
to
her
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
upstairs
to
Elizabeth-Jane
's
room
the
latter
had
taken
off
*NL*
her
out-door
things
,
and
was
resting
over
a
book
.
Lucetta
found
in
a
*NL*
moment
that
she
had
not
yet
learnt
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
come
down
to
you
,
Miss
Templeman
,
''
she
said
simply
.
``
I
was
*NL*
coming
to
ask
if
you
had
quite
recovered
from
your
fright
,
but
I
found
*NL*
you
had
a
visitor
.
What
are
the
bells
ringing
for
,
I
wonder
?
And
the
*NL*
band
,
too
,
is
playing
.
Somebody
must
be
married
;
or
else
they
are
*NL*
practising
for
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
uttered
a
vague
``
Yes
,
''
and
seating
herself
by
the
other
young
*NL*
woman
looked
musingly
at
her
.
``
What
a
lonely
creature
you
are
,
''
she
*NL*
presently
said
;
``
never
knowing
what
's
going
on
,
or
what
people
are
*NL*
talking
about
everywhere
with
keen
interest
.
You
should
get
out
,
and
*NL*
gossip
about
as
other
women
do
,
and
then
you
would
n't
be
obliged
to
ask
*NL*
me
a
question
of
that
kind
.
Well
,
now
,
I
have
something
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
said
she
was
so
glad
,
and
made
herself
receptive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
rather
a
long
way
back
,
''
said
Lucetta
,
the
difficulty
of
*NL*
explaining
herself
satisfactorily
to
the
pondering
one
beside
her
*NL*
growing
more
apparent
at
each
syllable
.
``
You
remember
that
trying
case
*NL*
of
conscience
I
told
you
of
some
time
ago
--
about
the
first
lover
and
the
*NL*
second
lover
?
''
She
let
out
in
jerky
phrases
a
leading
word
or
two
of
the
*NL*
story
she
had
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
--
I
remember
the
story
of
YOUR
FRIEND
,
''
said
Elizabeth
drily
,
*NL*
regarding
the
irises
of
Lucetta
's
eyes
as
though
to
catch
their
exact
*NL*
shade
.
``
The
two
lovers
--
the
old
one
and
the
new
:
how
she
wanted
to
marry
*NL*
the
second
,
but
felt
she
ought
to
marry
the
first
;
so
that
she
neglected
*NL*
the
better
course
to
follow
the
evil
,
like
the
poet
Ovid
I
've
just
been
*NL*
construing
:
`
Video
meliora
proboque
,
deteriora
sequor
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
;
she
did
n't
follow
evil
exactly
!
''
said
Lucetta
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
that
she
--
or
as
I
may
say
you
''
--
answered
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
dropping
the
mask
,
``
were
in
honour
and
conscience
bound
to
marry
the
*NL*
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
's
blush
at
being
seen
through
came
and
went
again
before
*NL*
she
replied
anxiously
,
``
You
will
never
breathe
this
,
will
you
,
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
if
you
say
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
tell
you
that
the
case
is
more
complicated
--
worse
,
in
*NL*
fact
--
than
it
seemed
in
my
story
.
I
and
the
first
man
were
thrown
*NL*
together
in
a
strange
way
,
and
felt
that
we
ought
to
be
united
,
as
the
*NL*
world
had
talked
of
us
.
He
was
a
widower
,
as
he
supposed
.
He
had
not
*NL*
heard
of
his
first
wife
for
many
years
.
But
the
wife
returned
,
and
*NL*
we
parted
.
She
is
now
dead
,
and
the
husband
comes
paying
me
addresses
*NL*
again
,
saying
,
`
Now
we
'll
complete
our
purposes
.
'
But
,
Elizabeth-Jane
,
*NL*
all
this
amounts
to
a
new
courtship
of
me
by
him
;
I
was
absolved
from
*NL*
all
vows
by
the
return
of
the
other
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
lately
renewed
your
promise
?
''
said
the
younger
with
quiet
*NL*
surmise
.
She
had
divined
Man
Number
One
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
wrung
from
me
by
a
threat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
.
But
I
think
when
any
one
gets
coupled
up
with
a
man
in
the
*NL*
past
so
unfortunately
as
you
have
done
she
ought
to
become
his
wife
if
*NL*
she
can
,
even
if
she
were
not
the
sinning
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
's
countenance
lost
its
sparkle
.
``
He
turned
out
to
be
a
man
I
*NL*
should
be
afraid
to
marry
,
''
she
pleaded
.
``
Really
afraid
!
And
it
was
not
*NL*
till
after
my
renewed
promise
that
I
knew
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
is
only
one
course
left
to
honesty
.
You
must
remain
a
single
*NL*
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
think
again
!
Do
consider
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
certain

''
interrupted
her
companion
hardily
.
``
I
have
guessed
very
*NL*
well
who
the
man
is

My
father

I
say
it
is
him

nobody
for
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Any
suspicion
of
impropriety
was
to
Elizabeth-Jane
like
a
red
rag
to
*NL*
a
bull
.
Her
craving
for
correctness
of
procedure
was
,
indeed
,
almost
*NL*
vicious
.
Owing
to
her
early
troubles
with
regard
to
her
mother
a
*NL*
semblance
of
irregularity
had
terrors
for
her
which
those
whose
names
*NL*
are
safeguarded
from
suspicion
know
nothing
of
.
``
You
ought
to
marry
*NL*
Mr.
Henchard
or
nobody
--
certainly
not
another
man
!
''
she
went
on
with
a
*NL*
quivering
lip
in
whose
movement
two
passions
shared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
admit
that
!
''
said
Lucetta
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admit
it
or
not
,
it
is
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
covered
her
eyes
with
her
right
hand
,
as
if
she
could
plead
no
*NL*
more
,
holding
out
her
left
to
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
HAVE
married
him
!
''
cried
the
latter
,
jumping
up
with
pleasure
*NL*
after
a
glance
at
Lucetta
's
fingers
.
``
When
did
you
do
it
?
Why
did
you
*NL*
not
tell
me
,
instead
of
teasing
me
like
this
?
How
very
honourable
*NL*
of
you
!
He
did
treat
my
mother
badly
once
,
it
seems
,
in
a
moment
of
*NL*
intoxication

And
it
is
true
that
he
is
stern
sometimes
.
But
you
*NL*
will
rule
him
entirely
,
I
am
sure
,
with
your
beauty
and
wealth
and
*NL*
accomplishments

You
are
the
woman
he
will
adore
,

we
shall
all
three
*NL*
be
happy
together
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
my
Elizabeth-Jane
!
''
cried
Lucetta
distressfully
.
''
'T
is
somebody
else
*NL*
that
I
have
married

I
was
so
desperate
--
so
afraid
of
being
forced
to
*NL*
anything
else
--
so
afraid
of
revelations
that
would
quench
his
love
for
*NL*
me
,
that
I
resolved
to
do
it
offhand
,
come
what
might

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
have
--
married
Mr.
Farfrae
!
''
cried
Elizabeth-Jane
,
in
Nathan
tones
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
bowed
.
She
had
recovered
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bells
are
ringing
on
that
account
,
''
she
said
.
``
My
husband
is
*NL*
downstairs
.
He
will
live
here
till
a
more
suitable
house
is
ready
for
*NL*
us
;
and
I
have
told
him
that
I
want
you
to
stay
with
me
just
as
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
think
of
it
alone
,
''
the
girl
quickly
replied
,
corking
up
the
*NL*
turmoil
of
her
feeling
with
grand
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
.
I
am
sure
we
shall
be
happy
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
departed
to
join
Donald
below
,
a
vague
uneasiness
floating
over
*NL*
her
joy
at
seeing
him
quite
at
home
there
.
Not
on
account
of
her
friend
*NL*
Elizabeth
did
she
feel
it
:
for
of
the
bearings
of
Elizabeth-Jane
's
*NL*
emotions
she
had
not
the
least
suspicion
;
but
on
Henchard
's
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
instant
decision
of
Susan
Henchard
's
daughter
was
to
dwell
*NL*
in
that
house
no
more
.
Apart
from
her
estimate
of
the
propriety
of
*NL*
Lucetta
's
conduct
,
Farfrae
had
been
so
nearly
her
avowed
lover
that
she
*NL*
felt
she
could
not
abide
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
early
in
the
evening
when
she
hastily
put
on
her
things
and
*NL*
went
out
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
knowing
the
ground
,
she
had
found
a
suitable
*NL*
lodging
,
and
arranged
to
enter
it
that
night
.
Returning
and
entering
*NL*
noiselessly
she
took
off
her
pretty
dress
and
arrayed
herself
in
a
plain
*NL*
one
,
packing
up
the
other
to
keep
as
her
best
;
for
she
would
have
to
*NL*
be
very
economical
now
.
She
wrote
a
note
to
leave
for
Lucetta
,
who
*NL*
was
closely
shut
up
in
the
drawing-room
with
Farfrae
;
and
then
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
called
a
man
with
a
wheel-barrow
;
and
seeing
her
boxes
*NL*
put
into
it
she
trotted
off
down
the
street
to
her
rooms
.
They
were
in
*NL*
the
street
in
which
Henchard
lived
,
and
almost
opposite
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
sat
down
and
considered
the
means
of
subsistence
.
The
little
*NL*
annual
sum
settled
on
her
by
her
stepfather
would
keep
body
and
soul
*NL*
together
.
A
wonderful
skill
in
netting
of
all
sorts
--
acquired
in
*NL*
childhood
by
making
seines
in
Newson
's
home
--
might
serve
her
in
good
*NL*
stead
;
and
her
studies
,
which
were
pursued
unremittingly
,
might
serve
*NL*
her
in
still
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
marriage
that
had
taken
place
was
known
throughout
*NL*
Casterbridge
;
had
been
discussed
noisily
on
kerbstones
,
confidentially
*NL*
behind
counters
,
and
jovially
at
the
Three
Mariners
.
Whether
Farfrae
*NL*
would
sell
his
business
and
set
up
for
a
gentleman
on
his
wife
's
money
,
*NL*
or
whether
he
would
show
independence
enough
to
stick
to
his
trade
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
brilliant
alliance
,
was
a
great
point
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
31
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
retort
of
the
furmity-woman
before
the
magistrates
had
spread
;
and
*NL*
in
four-and-twenty
hours
there
was
not
a
person
in
Casterbridge
*NL*
who
remained
unacquainted
with
the
story
of
Henchard
's
mad
freak
at
*NL*
Weydon-Priors
Fair
,
long
years
before
.
The
amends
he
had
made
in
after
*NL*
life
were
lost
sight
of
in
the
dramatic
glare
of
the
original
act
.
Had
*NL*
the
incident
been
well
known
of
old
and
always
,
it
might
by
this
time
*NL*
have
grown
to
be
lightly
regarded
as
the
rather
tall
wild
oat
,
but
*NL*
well-nigh
the
single
one
,
of
a
young
man
with
whom
the
steady
and
mature
*NL*
-LRB-
if
somewhat
headstrong
-RRB-
burgher
of
to-day
had
scarcely
a
point
in
*NL*
common
.
But
the
act
having
lain
as
dead
and
buried
ever
since
,
the
*NL*
interspace
of
years
was
unperceived
;
and
the
black
spot
of
his
youth
*NL*
wore
the
aspect
of
a
recent
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Small
as
the
police-court
incident
had
been
in
itself
,
it
formed
the
*NL*
edge
or
turn
in
the
incline
of
Henchard
's
fortunes
.
On
that
day
--
almost
*NL*
at
that
minute
--
he
passed
the
ridge
of
prosperity
and
honour
,
and
began
*NL*
to
descend
rapidly
on
the
other
side
.
It
was
strange
how
soon
he
sank
*NL*
in
esteem
.
Socially
he
had
received
a
startling
fillip
downwards
;
and
,
*NL*
having
already
lost
commercial
buoyancy
from
rash
transactions
,
the
*NL*
velocity
of
his
descent
in
both
aspects
became
accelerated
every
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
gazed
more
at
the
pavements
and
less
at
the
house-fronts
when
he
*NL*
walked
about
;
more
at
the
feet
and
leggings
of
men
,
and
less
into
the
*NL*
pupils
of
their
eyes
with
the
blazing
regard
which
formerly
had
made
*NL*
them
blink
.
*NL*
*NL*
New
events
combined
to
undo
him
.
It
had
been
a
bad
year
for
others
*NL*
besides
himself
,
and
the
heavy
failure
of
a
debtor
whom
he
had
trusted
*NL*
generously
completed
the
overthrow
of
his
tottering
credit
.
And
now
,
*NL*
in
his
desperation
,
he
failed
to
preserve
that
strict
correspondence
*NL*
between
bulk
and
sample
which
is
the
soul
of
commerce
in
grain
.
For
*NL*
this
,
one
of
his
men
was
mainly
to
blame
;
that
worthy
,
in
his
great
*NL*
unwisdom
,
having
picked
over
the
sample
of
an
enormous
quantity
of
*NL*
second-rate
corn
which
Henchard
had
in
hand
,
and
removed
the
pinched
,
*NL*
blasted
,
and
smutted
grains
in
great
numbers
.
The
produce
if
*NL*
honestly
offered
would
have
created
no
scandal
;
but
the
blunder
of
*NL*
misrepresentation
,
coming
at
such
a
moment
,
dragged
Henchard
's
name
into
*NL*
the
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
details
of
his
failure
were
of
the
ordinary
kind
.
One
day
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
was
passing
the
King
's
Arms
,
when
she
saw
people
bustling
*NL*
in
and
out
more
than
usual
where
there
was
no
market
.
A
bystander
*NL*
informed
her
,
with
some
surprise
at
her
ignorance
,
that
it
was
a
meeting
*NL*
of
the
Commissioners
under
Mr.
Henchard
's
bankruptcy
.
She
felt
quite
*NL*
tearful
,
and
when
she
heard
that
he
was
present
in
the
hotel
she
wished
*NL*
to
go
in
and
see
him
,
but
was
advised
not
to
intrude
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
which
debtor
and
creditors
had
assembled
was
a
front
*NL*
one
,
and
Henchard
,
looking
out
of
the
window
,
had
caught
sight
of
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
through
the
wire
blind
.
His
examination
had
closed
,
and
*NL*
the
creditors
were
leaving
.
The
appearance
of
Elizabeth
threw
him
into
a
*NL*
reverie
,
till
,
turning
his
face
from
the
window
,
and
towering
above
all
*NL*
the
rest
,
he
called
their
attention
for
a
moment
more
.
His
countenance
*NL*
had
somewhat
changed
from
its
flush
of
prosperity
;
the
black
hair
and
*NL*
whiskers
were
the
same
as
ever
,
but
a
film
of
ash
was
over
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
he
said
,
``
over
and
above
the
assets
that
we
've
been
talking
*NL*
about
,
and
that
appear
on
the
balance-sheet
,
there
be
these
.
It
all
*NL*
belongs
to
ye
,
as
much
as
everything
else
I
've
got
,
and
I
do
n't
wish
to
*NL*
keep
it
from
you
,
not
I.
''
Saying
this
,
he
took
his
gold
watch
from
*NL*
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
table
;
then
his
purse
--
the
yellow
canvas
*NL*
moneybag
,
such
as
was
carried
by
all
farmers
and
dealers
--
untying
it
,
*NL*
and
shaking
the
money
out
upon
the
table
beside
the
watch
.
The
latter
*NL*
he
drew
back
quickly
for
an
instant
,
to
remove
the
hair-guard
made
and
*NL*
given
him
by
Lucetta
.
``
There
,
now
you
have
all
I
've
got
in
the
world
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
And
I
wish
for
your
sakes
't
was
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
creditors
,
farmers
almost
to
a
man
,
looked
at
the
watch
,
and
at
the
*NL*
money
,
and
into
the
street
;
when
Farmer
James
Everdene
of
Weatherbury
*NL*
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Henchard
,
''
he
said
warmly
.
``
We
do
n't
want
that
.
'T
is
honourable
*NL*
in
ye
;
but
keep
it
.
What
do
you
say
,
neighbours
--
do
ye
agree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
sure
:
we
do
n't
wish
it
at
all
,
''
said
Grower
,
another
creditor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
keep
it
,
of
course
,
''
murmured
another
in
the
background
--
a
*NL*
silent
,
reserved
young
man
named
Boldwood
;
and
the
rest
responded
*NL*
unanimously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
senior
Commissioner
,
addressing
Henchard
,
``
though
the
*NL*
case
is
a
desperate
one
,
I
am
bound
to
admit
that
I
have
never
met
a
*NL*
debtor
who
behaved
more
fairly
.
I
've
proved
the
balance-sheet
to
be
as
*NL*
honestly
made
out
as
it
could
possibly
be
;
we
have
had
no
trouble
;
there
*NL*
have
been
no
evasions
and
no
concealments
.
The
rashness
of
dealing
which
*NL*
led
to
this
unhappy
situation
is
obvious
enough
;
but
as
far
as
I
can
see
*NL*
every
attempt
has
been
made
to
avoid
wronging
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
was
more
affected
by
this
than
he
cared
to
let
them
perceive
,
*NL*
and
he
turned
aside
to
the
window
again
.
A
general
murmur
of
agreement
*NL*
followed
the
Commissioner
's
words
,
and
the
meeting
dispersed
.
When
they
*NL*
were
gone
Henchard
regarded
the
watch
they
had
returned
to
him
.
''
'T
is
n't
*NL*
mine
by
rights
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Why
the
devil
did
n't
they
take
*NL*
it
?
--
I
do
n't
want
what
do
n't
belong
to
me
!
''
Moved
by
a
recollection
he
*NL*
took
the
watch
to
the
maker
's
just
opposite
,
sold
it
there
and
then
for
*NL*
what
the
tradesman
offered
,
and
went
with
the
proceeds
to
one
among
*NL*
the
smaller
of
his
creditors
,
a
cottager
of
Durnover
in
straitened
*NL*
circumstances
,
to
whom
he
handed
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
everything
was
ticketed
that
Henchard
had
owned
,
and
the
auctions
*NL*
were
in
progress
,
there
was
quite
a
sympathetic
reaction
in
the
town
,
*NL*
which
till
then
for
some
time
past
had
done
nothing
but
condemn
him
.
Now
*NL*
that
Henchard
's
whole
career
was
pictured
distinctly
to
his
neighbours
,
*NL*
and
they
could
see
how
admirably
he
had
used
his
one
talent
of
energy
*NL*
to
create
a
position
of
affluence
out
of
absolutely
nothing
--
which
*NL*
was
really
all
he
could
show
when
he
came
to
the
town
as
a
journeyman
*NL*
hay-trusser
,
with
his
wimble
and
knife
in
his
basket
--
they
wondered
and
*NL*
regretted
his
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Try
as
she
might
,
Elizabeth
could
never
meet
with
him
.
She
believed
*NL*
in
him
still
,
though
nobody
else
did
;
and
she
wanted
to
be
allowed
to
*NL*
forgive
him
for
his
roughness
to
her
,
and
to
help
him
in
his
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wrote
to
him
;
he
did
not
reply
.
She
then
went
to
his
house
--
the
*NL*
great
house
she
had
lived
in
so
happily
for
a
time
--
with
its
front
*NL*
of
dun
brick
,
vitrified
here
and
there
and
its
heavy
sash-bars
--
but
*NL*
Henchard
was
to
be
found
there
no
more
.
The
ex-Mayor
had
left
the
home
*NL*
of
his
prosperity
,
and
gone
into
Jopp
's
cottage
by
the
Priory
Mill
--
the
*NL*
sad
purlieu
to
which
he
had
wandered
on
the
night
of
his
discovery
that
*NL*
she
was
not
his
daughter
.
Thither
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
thought
it
odd
that
he
had
fixed
on
this
spot
to
retire
to
,
*NL*
but
assumed
that
necessity
had
no
choice
.
Trees
which
seemed
old
enough
*NL*
to
have
been
planted
by
the
friars
still
stood
around
,
and
the
back
*NL*
hatch
of
the
original
mill
yet
formed
a
cascade
which
had
raised
its
*NL*
terrific
roar
for
centuries
.
The
cottage
itself
was
built
of
old
*NL*
stones
from
the
long
dismantled
Priory
,
scraps
of
tracery
,
moulded
*NL*
window-jambs
,
and
arch-labels
,
being
mixed
in
with
the
rubble
of
the
*NL*
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
cottage
he
occupied
a
couple
of
rooms
,
Jopp
,
whom
Henchard
*NL*
had
employed
,
abused
,
cajoled
,
and
dismissed
by
turns
,
being
the
*NL*
householder
.
But
even
here
her
stepfather
could
not
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
by
his
daughter
?
''
pleaded
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
nobody
--
at
present
:
that
's
his
order
,
''
she
was
informed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
she
was
passing
by
the
corn-stores
and
hay-barns
which
had
*NL*
been
the
headquarters
of
his
business
.
She
knew
that
he
ruled
there
*NL*
no
longer
;
but
it
was
with
amazement
that
she
regarded
the
familiar
*NL*
gateway
.
A
smear
of
decisive
lead-coloured
paint
had
been
laid
on
to
*NL*
obliterate
Henchard
's
name
,
though
its
letters
dimly
loomed
through
like
*NL*
ships
in
a
fog
.
Over
these
,
in
fresh
white
,
spread
the
name
of
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
Abel
Whittle
was
edging
his
skeleton
in
at
the
wicket
,
and
she
said
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
Farfrae
is
master
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yaas
,
Miss
Henchet
,
''
he
said
,
``
Mr.
Farfrae
have
bought
the
concern
and
*NL*
all
of
we
work-folk
with
it
;
and
't
is
better
for
us
than
't
was
--
though
*NL*
I
should
n't
say
that
to
you
as
a
daughter-law
.
We
work
harder
,
but
we
*NL*
bai
n't
made
afeard
now
.
It
was
fear
made
my
few
poor
hairs
so
thin
!
No
*NL*
busting
out
,

and
though

I

Miss
Henchet

*NL*
*NL*
The
intelligence
was
in
a
general
sense
true
;
and
Henchard
's
stores
,
*NL*
which
had
remained
in
a
paralyzed
condition
during
the
settlement
of
*NL*
his
bankruptcy
,
were
stirred
into
activity
again
when
the
new
tenant
had
*NL*
possession
.
Thenceforward
the
full
sacks
,
looped
with
the
shining
chain
,
*NL*
went
scurrying
up
and
down
under
the
cat-head
,
hairy
arms
were
thrust
*NL*
out
from
the
different
door-ways
,
and
the
grain
was
hauled
in
;
trusses
*NL*
of
hay
were
tossed
anew
in
and
out
of
the
barns
,
and
the
wimbles
*NL*
creaked
;
while
the
scales
and
steel-yards
began
to
be
busy
where
*NL*
guess-work
had
formerly
been
the
rule
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
bridges
stood
near
the
lower
part
of
Casterbridge
town
.
The
first
,
*NL*
of
weather-stained
brick
,
was
immediately
at
the
end
of
High
Street
,
*NL*
where
a
diverging
branch
from
that
thoroughfare
ran
round
to
the
*NL*
low-lying
Durnover
lanes
;
so
that
the
precincts
of
the
bridge
formed
*NL*
the
merging
point
of
respectability
and
indigence
.
The
second
bridge
,
of
*NL*
stone
,
was
further
out
on
the
highway
--
in
fact
,
fairly
in
the
meadows
,
*NL*
though
still
within
the
town
boundary
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
bridges
had
speaking
countenances
.
Every
projection
in
each
*NL*
was
worn
down
to
obtuseness
,
partly
by
weather
,
more
by
friction
from
*NL*
generations
of
loungers
,
whose
toes
and
heels
had
from
year
to
year
*NL*
made
restless
movements
against
these
parapets
,
as
they
had
stood
there
*NL*
meditating
on
the
aspect
of
affairs
.
In
the
case
of
the
more
friable
*NL*
bricks
and
stones
even
the
flat
faces
were
worn
into
hollows
by
the
same
*NL*
mixed
mechanism
.
The
masonry
of
the
top
was
clamped
with
iron
at
each
*NL*
joint
;
since
it
had
been
no
uncommon
thing
for
desperate
men
to
wrench
*NL*
the
coping
off
and
throw
it
down
the
river
,
in
reckless
defiance
of
the
*NL*
magistrates
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
to
this
pair
of
bridges
gravitated
all
the
failures
of
the
town
;
*NL*
those
who
had
failed
in
business
,
in
love
,
in
sobriety
,
in
crime
.
Why
*NL*
the
unhappy
hereabout
usually
chose
the
bridges
for
their
meditations
in
*NL*
preference
to
a
railing
,
a
gate
,
or
a
stile
,
was
not
so
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
marked
difference
of
quality
between
the
personages
who
*NL*
haunted
the
near
bridge
of
brick
and
the
personages
who
haunted
the
far
*NL*
one
of
stone
.
Those
of
lowest
character
preferred
the
former
,
adjoining
*NL*
the
town
;
they
did
not
mind
the
glare
of
the
public
eye
.
They
had
been
*NL*
of
comparatively
no
account
during
their
successes
;
and
though
they
*NL*
might
feel
dispirited
,
they
had
no
particular
sense
of
shame
in
their
*NL*
ruin
.
Their
hands
were
mostly
kept
in
their
pockets
;
they
wore
a
leather
*NL*
strap
round
their
hips
or
knees
,
and
boots
that
required
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
lacing
,
but
seemed
never
to
get
any
.
Instead
of
sighing
at
their
*NL*
adversities
they
spat
,
and
instead
of
saying
the
iron
had
entered
into
*NL*
their
souls
they
said
they
were
down
on
their
luck
.
Jopp
in
his
time
of
*NL*
distress
had
often
stood
here
;
so
had
Mother
Cuxsom
,
Christopher
Coney
,
*NL*
and
poor
Abel
Whittle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
miserables
who
would
pause
on
the
remoter
bridge
were
of
a
politer
*NL*
stamp
.
They
included
bankrupts
,
hypochondriacs
,
persons
who
were
what
is
*NL*
called
``
out
of
a
situation
''
from
fault
or
lucklessness
,
the
inefficient
*NL*
of
the
professional
class
--
shabby-genteel
men
,
who
did
not
know
how
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
the
weary
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
,
and
the
yet
more
*NL*
weary
time
between
dinner
and
dark
.
The
eye
of
this
species
were
mostly
*NL*
directed
over
the
parapet
upon
the
running
water
below
.
A
man
seen
there
*NL*
looking
thus
fixedly
into
the
river
was
pretty
sure
to
be
one
whom
*NL*
the
world
did
not
treat
kindly
for
some
reason
or
other
.
While
one
in
*NL*
straits
on
the
townward
bridge
did
not
mind
who
saw
him
so
,
and
kept
*NL*
his
back
to
the
parapet
to
survey
the
passers-by
,
one
in
straits
on
this
*NL*
never
faced
the
road
,
never
turned
his
head
at
coming
footsteps
,
but
,
*NL*
sensitive
to
his
own
condition
,
watched
the
current
whenever
a
stranger
*NL*
approached
,
as
if
some
strange
fish
interested
him
,
though
every
finned
*NL*
thing
had
been
poached
out
of
the
river
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
and
thus
they
would
muse
;
if
their
grief
were
the
grief
of
*NL*
oppression
they
would
wish
themselves
kings
;
if
their
grief
were
*NL*
poverty
,
wish
themselves
millionaires
;
if
sin
,
they
would
wish
they
were
*NL*
saints
or
angels
;
if
despised
love
,
that
they
were
some
much-courted
*NL*
Adonis
of
county
fame
.
Some
had
been
known
to
stand
and
think
so
long
*NL*
with
this
fixed
gaze
downward
that
eventually
they
had
allowed
their
*NL*
poor
carcases
to
follow
that
gaze
;
and
they
were
discovered
the
next
*NL*
morning
out
of
reach
of
their
troubles
,
either
here
or
in
the
deep
pool
*NL*
called
Blackwater
,
a
little
higher
up
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
bridge
came
Henchard
,
as
other
unfortunates
had
come
before
him
,
*NL*
his
way
thither
being
by
the
riverside
path
on
the
chilly
edge
of
the
*NL*
town
.
Here
he
was
standing
one
windy
afternoon
when
Durnover
church
*NL*
clock
struck
five
.
While
the
gusts
were
bringing
the
notes
to
his
ears
*NL*
across
the
damp
intervening
flat
a
man
passed
behind
him
and
greeted
*NL*
Henchard
by
name
.
Henchard
turned
slightly
and
saw
that
the
corner
was
*NL*
Jopp
,
his
old
foreman
,
now
employed
elsewhere
,
to
whom
,
though
he
*NL*
hated
him
,
he
had
gone
for
lodgings
because
Jopp
was
the
one
man
in
*NL*
Casterbridge
whose
observation
and
opinion
the
fallen
corn-merchant
*NL*
despised
to
the
point
of
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
returned
him
a
scarcely
perceptible
nod
,
and
Jopp
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
and
she
are
gone
into
their
new
house
to-day
,
''
said
Jopp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Henchard
absently
.
``
Which
house
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
old
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
into
my
house
?
''
And
starting
up
Henchard
added
,
``
MY
house
of
all
*NL*
others
in
the
town
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
somebody
was
sure
to
live
there
,
and
you
could
n't
,
it
can
do
*NL*
`
ee
no
harm
that
he
's
the
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
true
:
he
felt
that
it
was
doing
him
no
harm
.
Farfrae
,
who
*NL*
had
already
taken
the
yards
and
stores
,
had
acquired
possession
of
the
*NL*
house
for
the
obvious
convenience
of
its
contiguity
.
And
yet
this
act
*NL*
of
his
taking
up
residence
within
those
roomy
chambers
while
he
,
their
*NL*
former
tenant
,
lived
in
a
cottage
,
galled
Henchard
indescribably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
continued
:
``
And
you
heard
of
that
fellow
who
bought
all
the
best
*NL*
furniture
at
your
sale
?
He
was
bidding
for
no
other
than
Farfrae
all
the
*NL*
while
!
It
has
never
been
moved
out
of
the
house
,
as
he
'd
already
got
the
*NL*
lease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
furniture
too
!
Surely
he
'll
buy
my
body
and
soul
likewise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
saying
he
wo
n't
,
if
you
be
willing
to
sell
.
''
And
having
*NL*
planted
these
wounds
in
the
heart
of
his
once
imperious
master
Jopp
went
*NL*
on
his
way
;
while
Henchard
stared
and
stared
into
the
racing
river
till
*NL*
the
bridge
seemed
moving
backward
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
low
land
grew
blacker
,
and
the
sky
a
deeper
grey
,
When
the
landscape
*NL*
looked
like
a
picture
blotted
in
with
ink
,
another
traveller
approached
*NL*
the
great
stone
bridge
.
He
was
driving
a
gig
,
his
direction
being
also
*NL*
townwards
.
On
the
round
of
the
middle
of
the
arch
the
gig
stopped
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Henchard
?
''
came
from
it
in
the
voice
of
Farfrae
.
Henchard
turned
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
that
he
had
guessed
rightly
Farfrae
told
the
man
who
accompanied
*NL*
him
to
drive
home
;
while
he
alighted
and
went
up
to
his
former
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
that
you
think
of
emigrating
,
Mr.
Henchard
?
''
he
said
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
true
?
I
have
a
real
reason
for
asking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
withheld
his
answer
for
several
instants
,
and
then
said
,
``
Yes
;
*NL*
it
is
true
.
I
am
going
where
you
were
going
to
a
few
years
ago
,
when
I
*NL*
prevented
you
and
got
you
to
bide
here
.
'T
is
turn
and
turn
about
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
!
Do
ye
mind
how
we
stood
like
this
in
the
Chalk
Walk
when
I
persuaded
*NL*
`
ee
to
stay
?
You
then
stood
without
a
chattel
to
your
name
,
and
I
was
*NL*
the
master
of
the
house
in
Corn
Street
.
But
now
I
stand
without
a
stick
*NL*
or
a
rag
,
and
the
master
of
that
house
is
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
that
's
so
!
It
's
the
way
o
'
the
warrld
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
true
!
''
cried
Henchard
,
throwing
himself
into
a
mood
of
*NL*
jocularity
.
``
Up
and
down
!
I
'm
used
to
it
.
What
's
the
odds
after
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
listen
to
me
,
if
it
's
no
taking
up
your
time
,
''
said
Farfrae
,
``
just
*NL*
as
I
listened
to
you
.
Do
n't
go
.
Stay
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
do
nothing
else
,
man
!
''
said
Henchard
scornfully
.
``
The
little
*NL*
money
I
have
will
just
keep
body
and
soul
together
for
a
few
weeks
,
and
*NL*
no
more
.
I
have
not
felt
inclined
to
go
back
to
journey-work
yet
;
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
stay
doing
nothing
,
and
my
best
chance
is
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
what
I
propose
is
this
--
if
ye
will
listen
.
Come
and
live
in
*NL*
your
old
house
.
We
can
spare
some
rooms
very
well
--
I
am
sure
my
wife
*NL*
would
not
mind
it
at
all
--
until
there
's
an
opening
for
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
started
.
Probably
the
picture
drawn
by
the
unsuspecting
Donald
*NL*
of
himself
under
the
same
roof
with
Lucetta
was
too
striking
to
*NL*
be
received
with
equanimity
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
gruffly
;
``
we
should
*NL*
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
hae
a
part
to
yourself
,
''
said
Farfrae
;
``
and
nobody
to
*NL*
interfere
wi
'
you
.
It
will
be
a
deal
healthier
than
down
there
by
the
*NL*
river
where
you
live
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
Henchard
refused
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you
ask
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
However
,
I
can
do
no
less
than
thank
`
ee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
into
the
town
together
side
by
side
,
as
they
had
done
when
*NL*
Henchard
persuaded
the
young
Scotchman
to
remain
.
``
Will
you
come
in
*NL*
and
have
some
supper
?
''
said
Farfrae
when
they
reached
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
town
,
where
their
paths
diverged
right
and
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By-the-bye
,
I
had
nearly
forgot
.
I
bought
a
good
deal
of
your
*NL*
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
no
that
I
wanted
it
so
very
much
for
myself
;
but
I
wish
ye
*NL*
to
pick
out
all
that
you
care
to
have
--
such
things
as
may
be
endeared
to
*NL*
ye
by
associations
,
or
particularly
suited
to
your
use
.
And
take
them
*NL*
to
your
own
house
--
it
will
not
be
depriving
me
,
we
can
do
with
less
very
*NL*
well
,
and
I
will
have
plenty
of
opportunities
of
getting
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
give
it
to
me
for
nothing
?
''
said
Henchard
.
``
But
you
paid
the
*NL*
creditors
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
;
but
maybe
it
's
worth
more
to
you
than
it
is
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
was
a
little
moved
.
``
I
--
sometimes
think
I
've
wronged
`
ee
!
''
he
*NL*
said
,
in
tones
which
showed
the
disquietude
that
the
night
shades
hid
in
*NL*
his
face
.
He
shook
Farfrae
abruptly
by
the
hand
,
and
hastened
away
as
*NL*
if
unwilling
to
betray
himself
further
.
Farfrae
saw
him
turn
through
the
*NL*
thoroughfare
into
Bull
Stake
and
vanish
down
towards
the
Priory
Mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Elizabeth-Jane
,
in
an
upper
room
no
larger
than
the
Prophet
's
*NL*
chamber
,
and
with
the
silk
attire
of
her
palmy
days
packed
away
in
a
*NL*
box
,
was
netting
with
great
industry
between
the
hours
which
she
devoted
*NL*
to
studying
such
books
as
she
could
get
hold
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lodgings
being
nearly
opposite
her
stepfather
's
former
residence
,
*NL*
now
Farfrae
's
,
she
could
see
Donald
and
Lucetta
speeding
in
and
out
*NL*
of
their
door
with
all
the
bounding
enthusiasm
of
their
situation
.
She
*NL*
avoided
looking
that
way
as
much
as
possible
,
but
it
was
hardly
in
human
*NL*
nature
to
keep
the
eyes
averted
when
the
door
slammed
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
living
on
thus
quietly
she
heard
the
news
that
Henchard
had
caught
*NL*
cold
and
was
confined
to
his
room
--
possibly
a
result
of
standing
about
*NL*
the
meads
in
damp
weather
.
She
went
off
to
his
house
at
once
.
This
*NL*
time
she
was
determined
not
to
be
denied
admittance
,
and
made
her
way
*NL*
upstairs
.
He
was
sitting
up
in
the
bed
with
a
greatcoat
round
him
,
and
*NL*
at
first
resented
her
intrusion
.
``
Go
away
--
go
away
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
to
see
`
ee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
father
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
see
`
ee
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
ice
was
broken
,
and
she
remained
.
She
made
the
room
more
*NL*
comfortable
,
gave
directions
to
the
people
below
,
and
by
the
time
she
*NL*
went
away
had
reconciled
her
stepfather
to
her
visiting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
,
either
of
her
ministrations
or
of
her
mere
presence
,
was
a
*NL*
rapid
recovery
.
He
soon
was
well
enough
to
go
out
;
and
now
things
seemed
*NL*
to
wear
a
new
colour
in
his
eyes
.
He
no
longer
thought
of
emigration
,
*NL*
and
thought
more
of
Elizabeth
.
The
having
nothing
to
do
made
him
more
*NL*
dreary
than
any
other
circumstance
;
and
one
day
,
with
better
views
of
*NL*
Farfrae
than
he
had
held
for
some
time
,
and
a
sense
that
honest
work
was
*NL*
not
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
,
he
stoically
went
down
to
Farfrae
's
yard
*NL*
and
asked
to
be
taken
on
as
a
journeyman
hay-trusser
.
He
was
engaged
*NL*
at
once
.
This
hiring
of
Henchard
was
done
through
a
foreman
,
Farfrae
*NL*
feeling
that
it
was
undesirable
to
come
personally
in
contact
with
the
*NL*
ex-corn-factor
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
.
While
anxious
to
help
*NL*
him
he
was
well
aware
by
this
time
of
his
uncertain
temper
,
and
thought
*NL*
reserved
relations
best
.
For
the
same
reason
his
orders
to
Henchard
to
*NL*
proceed
to
this
and
that
country
farm
trussing
in
the
usual
way
were
*NL*
always
given
through
a
third
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
these
arrangements
worked
well
,
it
being
the
custom
to
truss
*NL*
in
the
respective
stack-yards
,
before
bringing
it
away
,
the
hay
bought
*NL*
at
the
different
farms
about
the
neighbourhood
;
so
that
Henchard
was
*NL*
often
absent
at
such
places
the
whole
week
long
.
When
this
was
all
done
,
*NL*
and
Henchard
had
become
in
a
measure
broken
in
,
he
came
to
work
daily
on
*NL*
the
home
premises
like
the
rest
.
And
thus
the
once
flourishing
merchant
*NL*
and
Mayor
and
what
not
stood
as
a
day-labourer
in
the
barns
and
*NL*
granaries
he
formerly
had
owned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
worked
as
a
journeyman
before
now
,
ha
'n'
t
I
?
''
he
would
say
in
*NL*
his
defiant
way
;
``
and
why
should
n't
I
do
it
again
?
''
But
he
looked
a
far
*NL*
different
journeyman
from
the
one
he
had
been
in
his
earlier
days
.
Then
*NL*
he
had
worn
clean
,
suitable
clothes
,
light
and
cheerful
in
hue
;
leggings
*NL*
yellow
as
marigolds
,
corduroys
immaculate
as
new
flax
,
and
a
neckerchief
*NL*
like
a
flower-garden
.
Now
he
wore
the
remains
of
an
old
blue
cloth
*NL*
suit
of
his
gentlemanly
times
,
a
rusty
silk
hat
,
and
a
once
black
*NL*
satin
stock
,
soiled
and
shabby
.
Clad
thus
he
went
to
and
fro
,
still
*NL*
comparatively
an
active
man
--
for
he
was
not
much
over
forty
--
and
saw
*NL*
with
the
other
men
in
the
yard
Donald
Farfrae
going
in
and
out
the
green
*NL*
door
that
led
to
the
garden
,
and
the
big
house
,
and
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
the
winter
it
was
rumoured
about
Casterbridge
that
*NL*
Mr.
Farfrae
,
already
in
the
Town
Council
,
was
to
be
proposed
for
Mayor
*NL*
in
a
year
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
was
wise
,
she
was
wise
in
her
generation
!
''
said
Henchard
to
*NL*
himself
when
he
heard
of
this
one
day
on
his
way
to
Farfrae
's
hay-barn
.
*NL*
He
thought
it
over
as
he
wimbled
his
bonds
,
and
the
piece
of
news
acted
*NL*
as
a
reviviscent
breath
to
that
old
view
of
his
--
of
Donald
Farfrae
as
*NL*
his
triumphant
rival
who
rode
rough-shod
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fellow
of
his
age
going
to
be
Mayor
,
indeed
!
''
he
murmured
with
a
*NL*
corner-drawn
smile
on
his
mouth
.
``
But
't
is
her
money
that
floats
en
*NL*
upward
.
Ha-ha
--
how
cust
odd
it
is
!
Here
be
I
,
his
former
master
,
working
*NL*
for
him
as
man
,
and
he
the
man
standing
as
master
,
with
my
house
and
my
*NL*
furniture
and
my
what-you-may-call
wife
all
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
these
things
a
hundred
times
a
day
.
During
the
whole
period
*NL*
of
his
acquaintance
with
Lucetta
he
had
never
wished
to
claim
her
as
*NL*
his
own
so
desperately
as
he
now
regretted
her
loss
.
It
was
no
mercenary
*NL*
hankering
after
her
fortune
that
moved
him
,
though
that
fortune
had
been
*NL*
the
means
of
making
her
so
much
the
more
desired
by
giving
her
the
air
*NL*
of
independence
and
sauciness
which
attracts
men
of
his
composition
.
*NL*
It
had
given
her
servants
,
house
,
and
fine
clothing
--
a
setting
that
*NL*
invested
Lucetta
with
a
startling
novelty
in
the
eyes
of
him
who
had
*NL*
known
her
in
her
narrow
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accordingly
lapsed
into
moodiness
,
and
at
every
allusion
to
the
*NL*
possibility
of
Farfrae
's
near
election
to
the
municipal
chair
his
former
*NL*
hatred
of
the
Scotchman
returned
.
Concurrently
with
this
he
underwent
*NL*
a
moral
change
.
It
resulted
in
his
significantly
saying
every
now
and
*NL*
then
,
in
tones
of
recklessness
,
``
Only
a
fortnight
more
!
''
--
``
Only
a
dozen
*NL*
days
!
''
and
so
forth
,
lessening
his
figures
day
by
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
d'ye
say
only
a
dozen
days
?
''
asked
Solomon
Longways
as
he
worked
*NL*
beside
Henchard
in
the
granary
weighing
oats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
in
twelve
days
I
shall
be
released
from
my
oath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
oath
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
oath
to
drink
no
spirituous
liquid
.
In
twelve
days
it
will
be
*NL*
twenty-one
years
since
I
swore
it
,
and
then
I
mean
to
enjoy
myself
,
*NL*
please
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
sat
at
her
window
one
Sunday
,
and
while
there
she
heard
*NL*
in
the
street
below
a
conversation
which
introduced
Henchard
's
name
.
She
*NL*
was
wondering
what
was
the
matter
,
when
a
third
person
who
was
passing
*NL*
by
asked
the
question
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Michael
Henchard
have
busted
out
drinking
after
taking
nothing
for
*NL*
twenty-one
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
jumped
up
,
put
on
her
things
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
33
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
date
there
prevailed
in
Casterbridge
a
convivial
*NL*
custom
--
scarcely
recognized
as
such
,
yet
none
the
less
established
.
On
*NL*
the
afternoon
of
every
Sunday
a
large
contingent
of
the
Casterbridge
*NL*
journeymen
--
steady
churchgoers
and
sedate
characters
--
having
attended
*NL*
service
,
filed
from
the
church
doors
across
the
way
to
the
Three
*NL*
Mariners
Inn
.
The
rear
was
usually
brought
up
by
the
choir
,
with
their
*NL*
bass-viols
,
fiddles
,
and
flutes
under
their
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
point
,
the
point
of
honour
,
on
these
sacred
occasions
was
*NL*
for
each
man
to
strictly
limit
himself
to
half-a-pint
of
liquor
.
This
*NL*
scrupulosity
was
so
well
understood
by
the
landlord
that
the
whole
*NL*
company
was
served
in
cups
of
that
measure
.
They
were
all
exactly
*NL*
alike
--
straight-sided
,
with
two
leafless
lime-trees
done
in
eel-brown
*NL*
on
the
sides
--
one
towards
the
drinker
's
lips
,
the
other
confronting
*NL*
his
comrade
.
To
wonder
how
many
of
these
cups
the
landlord
possessed
*NL*
altogether
was
a
favourite
exercise
of
children
in
the
marvellous
.
Forty
*NL*
at
least
might
have
been
seen
at
these
times
in
the
large
room
,
forming
*NL*
a
ring
round
the
margin
of
the
great
sixteen-legged
oak
table
,
like
the
*NL*
monolithic
circle
of
Stonehenge
in
its
pristine
days
.
Outside
and
above
*NL*
the
forty
cups
came
a
circle
of
forty
smoke-jets
from
forty
clay
pipes
;
*NL*
outside
the
pipes
the
countenances
of
the
forty
church-goers
,
supported
*NL*
at
the
back
by
a
circle
of
forty
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
not
the
conversation
of
week-days
,
but
a
thing
*NL*
altogether
finer
in
point
and
higher
in
tone
.
They
invariably
*NL*
discussed
the
sermon
,
dissecting
it
,
weighing
it
,
as
above
or
below
the
*NL*
average
--
the
general
tendency
being
to
regard
it
as
a
scientific
feat
or
*NL*
performance
which
had
no
relation
to
their
own
lives
,
except
as
between
*NL*
critics
and
the
thing
criticized
.
The
bass-viol
player
and
the
clerk
*NL*
usually
spoke
with
more
authority
than
the
rest
on
account
of
their
*NL*
official
connection
with
the
preacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
Three
Mariners
was
the
inn
chosen
by
Henchard
as
the
place
for
*NL*
closing
his
long
term
of
dramless
years
.
He
had
so
timed
his
entry
as
to
*NL*
be
well
established
in
the
large
room
by
the
time
the
forty
church-goers
*NL*
entered
to
their
customary
cups
.
The
flush
upon
his
face
proclaimed
*NL*
at
once
that
the
vow
of
twenty-one
years
had
lapsed
,
and
the
era
of
*NL*
recklessness
begun
anew
.
He
was
seated
on
a
small
table
,
drawn
up
to
the
*NL*
side
of
the
massive
oak
board
reserved
for
the
churchmen
,
a
few
of
*NL*
whom
nodded
to
him
as
they
took
their
places
and
said
,
``
How
be
ye
,
Mr.
*NL*
Henchard
?
Quite
a
stranger
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
reply
for
a
few
moments
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
rested
on
his
stretched-out
legs
and
boots
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
at
*NL*
length
;
``
that
's
true
.
I
've
been
down
in
spirit
for
weeks
;
some
of
*NL*
ye
know
the
cause
.
I
am
better
now
,
but
not
quite
serene
.
I
want
you
*NL*
fellows
of
the
choir
to
strike
up
a
tune
;
and
what
with
that
and
this
*NL*
brew
of
Stannidge
's
,
I
am
in
hopes
of
getting
altogether
out
of
my
minor
*NL*
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
the
first
fiddle
.
``
We
've
let
back
our
strings

*NL*
that
's
true
,
but
we
can
soon
pull
'em
up
again

Sound
A

neighbours
,
and
*NL*
give
the
man
a
stave

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
a
curse
what
the
words
be

''
said
Henchard
.
``
Hymns
,
*NL*
ballets
,
or
rantipole
rubbish
;
the
Rogue
's
March
or
the
cherubim

warble
--
't
is
all
the
same
to
me
if
't
is
good
harmony
,
and
well
put
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
heh
,
heh
--
it
may
be
we
can
do
that
,
and
not
a
man
among
us
that
*NL*
have
sat
in
the
gallery
less
than
twenty
year
,
''
said
the
leader
of
the
*NL*
band
.
``
As
't
is
Sunday
,
neighbours
,
suppose
we
raise
the
Fourth
Psa'am
,
*NL*
to
Samuel
Wakely
's
tune
,
as
improved
by
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
Samuel
Wakely
's
tune
,
as
improved
by
thee
!

said
Henchard
.
``
Chuck
*NL*
across
one
of
your
psalters
--
old
Wiltshire
is
the
only
tune
worth
*NL*
singing
--
the
psalm-tune
that
would
make
my
blood
ebb
and
flow
like
the
*NL*
sea
when
I
was
a
steady
chap
.
I
'll
find
some
words
to
fit
en
.
''
He
took
*NL*
one
of
the
psalters
and
began
turning
over
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chancing
to
look
out
of
the
window
at
that
moment
he
saw
a
flock
of
*NL*
people
passing
by
,
and
perceived
them
to
be
the
congregation
of
the
*NL*
upper
church
,
now
just
dismissed
,
their
sermon
having
been
a
longer
*NL*
one
than
that
the
lower
parish
was
favoured
with
.
Among
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
leading
inhabitants
walked
Mr.
Councillor
Farfrae
with
Lucetta
upon
his
*NL*
arm
,
the
observed
and
imitated
of
all
the
smaller
tradesmen
's
womankind
.
*NL*
Henchard
's
mouth
changed
a
little
,
and
he
continued
to
turn
over
the
*NL*
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
''
he
said
,
``
Psalm
the
Hundred-and-Ninth

to
the
tune
of

Wiltshire

verses
ten
to
fifteen

I

``

the
leader
hastily
;

`
son
's
mare
,
thinking
to
please
him
,
but
*NL*
pa
`
son
were
quite
upset
.
Whatever
Servant
David
were
thinking
about
when
*NL*
he
made
a
Psalm
that
nobody
can
sing
without
disgracing
himself
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
fathom
!
Now
then
,
the
Fourth
Psalm
,
to
Samuel
Wakely
's
tune
,
as
improved
*NL*
by
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Od
seize
your
sauce
--
I
tell
ye
to
sing
the
Hundred-and-Ninth
to
*NL*
Wiltshire
,
and
sing
it
you
shall
!
''
roared
Henchard
.
``
Not
a
single
one
*NL*
of
all
the
droning
crew
of
ye
goes
out
of
this
room
till
that
Psalm
is
*NL*
sung
!
''
He
slipped
off
the
table
,
seized
the
poker
,
and
going
to
the
door
*NL*
placed
his
back
against
it
.
``
Now
then
,
go
ahead
,
if
you
do
n't
wish
to
*NL*
have
your
cust
pates
broke
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
`
ee
,
do
n't
`
ee
take
on
so
!
--
As
't
is
the
Sabbath-day
,
and
't
is
*NL*
Servant
David
's
words
and
not
ours
,
perhaps
we
do
n't
mind
for
once
,
*NL*
hey
?
''
said
one
of
the
terrified
choir
,
looking
round
upon
the
rest
.
So
*NL*
the
instruments
were
tuned
and
the
comminatory
verses
sung
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
ye
,
thank
ye
,
''
said
Henchard
in
a
softened
voice
,
his
eyes
*NL*
growing
downcast
,
and
his
manner
that
of
a
man
much
moved
by
the
*NL*
strains
.
``
Do
n't
you
blame
David
,
''
he
went
on
in
low
tones
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
without
raising
his
eyes
.
``
He
knew
what
he
was
about
when
he
wrote
*NL*
that
!
...
If
I
could
afford
it
,
be
hanged
if
I
would
n't
keep
a
church
*NL*
choir
at
my
own
expense
to
play
and
sing
to
me
at
these
low
,
dark
times
*NL*
of
my
life
.
But
the
bitter
thing
is
,
that
when
I
was
rich
I
did
n't
need
*NL*
what
I
could
have
,
and
now
I
be
poor
I
ca
n't
have
what
I
need
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
paused
,
Lucetta
and
Farfrae
passed
again
,
this
time
homeward
,
*NL*
it
being
their
custom
to
take
,
like
others
,
a
short
walk
out
on
the
*NL*
highway
and
back
,
between
church
and
tea-time
.
``
There
's
the
man
we
've
*NL*
been
singing
about
,
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
players
and
singers
turned
their
heads
and
saw
his
meaning
.
``
Heaven
*NL*
forbid
!
''
said
the
bass-player
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
man
,
''
repeated
Henchard
doggedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
I
'd
known
,
''
said
the
performer
on
the
clarionet
solemnly
,
*NL*
``
that
't
was
meant
for
a
living
man
,
nothing
should
have
drawn
out
of
my
*NL*
wynd-pipe
the
breath
for
that
Psalm
,
so
help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
from
mine
,
''
said
the
first
singer
.
``
But
,
thought
I
,
as
it
was
made
*NL*
so
long
ago
perhaps
there
is
n't
much
in
it
,
so
I
'll
oblige
a
neighbour
;
*NL*
for
there
's
nothing
to
be
said
against
the
tune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
boys
,
you
've
sung
it
,
''
said
Henchard
triumphantly
.
``
As
for
him
,
*NL*
it
was
partly
by
his
songs
that
he
got
over
me
,
and
heaved
me
out
...
I
*NL*
could
double
him
up
like
that
--
and
yet
I
do
n't
.
''
He
laid
the
poker
*NL*
across
his
knee
,
bent
it
as
if
it
were
a
twig
,
flung
it
down
,
and
came
*NL*
away
from
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
time
that
Elizabeth-Jane
,
having
heard
where
her
*NL*
stepfather
was
,
entered
the
room
with
a
pale
and
agonized
countenance
.
*NL*
The
choir
and
the
rest
of
the
company
moved
off
,
in
accordance
with
*NL*
their
half-pint
regulation
.
Elizabeth-Jane
went
up
to
Henchard
,
and
*NL*
entreated
him
to
accompany
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
hour
the
volcanic
fires
of
his
nature
had
burnt
down
,
and
having
*NL*
drunk
no
great
quantity
as
yet
he
was
inclined
to
acquiesce
.
She
took
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
together
they
went
on
.
Henchard
walked
blankly
,
like
a
*NL*
blind
man
,
repeating
to
himself
the
last
words
of
the
singers
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
next
age
his
hated
name
*NL*
Shall
utterly
deface
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
said
to
her
,
``
I
am
a
man
to
my
word
.
I
have
kept
my
oath
*NL*
for
twenty-one
years
;
and
now
I
can
drink
with
a
good
conscience
...
If
I
*NL*
do
n't
do
for
him
--
well
,
I
am
a
fearful
practical
joker
when
I
choose
!
He
*NL*
has
taken
away
everything
from
me
,
and
by
heavens
,
if
I
meet
him
I
wo
n't
*NL*
answer
for
my
deeds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
half-uttered
words
alarmed
Elizabeth
--
all
the
more
by
reason
of
*NL*
the
still
determination
of
Henchard
's
mien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
do
?
''
she
asked
cautiously
,
while
trembling
with
*NL*
disquietude
,
and
guessing
Henchard
's
allusion
only
too
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
did
not
answer
,
and
they
went
on
till
they
had
reached
his
*NL*
cottage
.
``
May
I
come
in
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
not
to-day
,
''
said
Henchard
;
and
she
went
away
;
feeling
that
*NL*
to
caution
Farfrae
was
almost
her
duty
,
as
it
was
certainly
her
strong
*NL*
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
on
the
Sunday
,
so
on
the
week-days
,
Farfrae
and
Lucetta
might
have
*NL*
been
seen
flitting
about
the
town
like
two
butterflies
--
or
rather
like
*NL*
a
bee
and
a
butterfly
in
league
for
life
.
She
seemed
to
take
no
pleasure
*NL*
in
going
anywhere
except
in
her
husband
's
company
;
and
hence
when
*NL*
business
would
not
permit
him
to
waste
an
afternoon
she
remained
indoors
*NL*
waiting
for
the
time
to
pass
till
his
return
,
her
face
being
visible
to
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
from
her
window
aloft
.
The
latter
,
however
,
did
not
say
*NL*
to
herself
that
Farfrae
should
be
thankful
for
such
devotion
,
but
,
*NL*
full
of
her
reading
,
she
cited
Rosalind
's
exclamation
:
``
Mistress
,
know
*NL*
yourself
;
down
on
your
knees
and
thank
Heaven
fasting
for
a
good
man
's
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
her
eye
upon
Henchard
also
.
One
day
he
answered
her
inquiry
*NL*
for
his
health
by
saying
that
he
could
not
endure
Abel
Whittle
's
pitying
*NL*
eyes
upon
him
while
they
worked
together
in
the
yard
.
``
He
is
such
a
*NL*
fool
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
that
he
can
never
get
out
of
his
mind
the
time
*NL*
when
I
was
master
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
and
wimble
for
you
instead
of
him
,
if
you
will
allow
me
,
''
*NL*
said
she
.
Her
motive
on
going
to
the
yard
was
to
get
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
observing
the
general
position
of
affairs
on
Farfrae
's
premises
now
that
*NL*
her
stepfather
was
a
workman
there
.
Henchard
's
threats
had
alarmed
her
*NL*
so
much
that
she
wished
to
see
his
behaviour
when
the
two
were
face
to
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
or
three
days
after
her
arrival
Donald
did
not
make
any
*NL*
appearance
.
Then
one
afternoon
the
green
door
opened
,
and
through
came
,
*NL*
first
Farfrae
,
and
at
his
heels
Lucetta
.
Donald
brought
his
wife
forward
*NL*
without
hesitation
,
it
being
obvious
that
he
had
no
suspicion
whatever
*NL*
of
any
antecedents
in
common
between
her
and
the
now
journeyman
*NL*
hay-trusser
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
did
not
turn
his
eyes
toward
either
of
the
pair
,
keeping
them
*NL*
fixed
on
the
bond
he
twisted
,
as
if
that
alone
absorbed
him
.
A
feeling
*NL*
of
delicacy
,
which
ever
prompted
Farfrae
to
avoid
anything
that
might
*NL*
seem
like
triumphing
over
a
fallen
rivel
,
led
him
to
keep
away
from
the
*NL*
hay-barn
where
Henchard
and
his
daughter
were
working
,
and
to
go
on
to
*NL*
the
corn
department
.
Meanwhile
Lucetta
,
never
having
been
informed
that
*NL*
Henchard
had
entered
her
husband
's
service
,
rambled
straight
on
to
the
*NL*
barn
,
where
she
came
suddenly
upon
Henchard
,
and
gave
vent
to
a
little
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
which
the
happy
and
busy
Donald
was
too
far
off
to
hear
.
Henchard
,
*NL*
with
withering
humility
of
demeanour
,
touched
the
brim
of
his
hat
to
*NL*
her
as
Whittle
and
the
rest
had
done
,
to
which
she
breathed
a
dead-alive
*NL*
``
Good
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
?
''
said
Henchard
,
as
if
he
had
not
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
good
afternoon
,
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
good
afternoon
,
ma'am
,
''
he
replied
,
touching
his
hat
again
.
``
I
*NL*
am
glad
to
see
you
,
ma'am
.
''
Lucetta
looked
embarrassed
,
and
Henchard
*NL*
continued
:
``
For
we
humble
workmen
here
feel
it
a
great
honour
that
a
*NL*
lady
should
look
in
and
take
an
interest
in
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
him
entreatingly
;
the
sarcasm
was
too
bitter
,
too
*NL*
unendurable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
the
time
,
ma'am
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
hastily
;
``
half-past
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
`
ee
.
An
hour
and
a
half
longer
before
we
are
released
from
work
.
*NL*
Ah
,
ma'am
,
we
of
the
lower
classes
know
nothing
of
the
gay
leisure
that
*NL*
such
as
you
enjoy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
could
do
so
Lucetta
left
him
,
nodded
and
smiled
*NL*
to
Elizabeth-Jane
,
and
joined
her
husband
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
enclosure
,
where
she
could
be
seen
leading
him
away
by
the
outer
gates
,
*NL*
so
as
to
avoid
passing
Henchard
again
.
That
she
had
been
taken
by
*NL*
surprise
was
obvious
.
The
result
of
this
casual
rencounter
was
that
the
*NL*
next
morning
a
note
was
put
into
Henchard
's
hand
by
the
postman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
,
''
said
Lucetta
,
with
as
much
bitterness
as
she
could
put
into
*NL*
a
small
communication
,
``
will
you
kindly
undertake
not
to
speak
to
me
in
*NL*
the
biting
undertones
you
used
to-day
,
if
I
walk
through
the
yard
at
*NL*
any
time
?
I
bear
you
no
ill-will
,
and
I
am
only
too
glad
that
you
should
*NL*
have
employment
of
my
dear
husband
;
but
in
common
fairness
treat
me
as
*NL*
his
wife
,
and
do
not
try
to
make
me
wretched
by
covert
sneers
.
I
have
*NL*
committed
no
crime
,
and
done
you
no
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fool
!
''
said
Henchard
with
fond
savagery
,
holding
out
the
note
.
``
To
*NL*
know
no
better
than
commit
herself
in
writing
like
this
!
Why
,
if
I
were
*NL*
to
show
that
to
her
dear
husband
--
pooh
!
''
He
threw
the
letter
into
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
took
care
not
to
come
again
among
the
hay
and
corn
.
She
would
*NL*
rather
have
died
than
run
the
risk
of
encountering
Henchard
at
such
*NL*
close
quarters
a
second
time
.
The
gulf
between
them
was
growing
wider
*NL*
every
day
.
Farfrae
was
always
considerate
to
his
fallen
acquaintance
;
*NL*
but
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
not
,
by
degrees
,
cease
to
regard
*NL*
the
ex-corn-merchant
as
more
than
one
of
his
other
workmen
.
Henchard
saw
*NL*
this
,
and
concealed
his
feelings
under
a
cover
of
stolidity
,
fortifying
*NL*
his
heart
by
drinking
more
freely
at
the
Three
Mariners
every
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
did
Elizabeth-Jane
,
in
her
endeavours
to
prevent
his
taking
other
*NL*
liquor
,
carry
tea
to
him
in
a
little
basket
at
five
o'clock
.
Arriving
*NL*
one
day
on
this
errand
she
found
her
stepfather
was
measuring
up
*NL*
clover-seed
and
rape-seed
in
the
corn-stores
on
the
top
floor
,
and
she
*NL*
ascended
to
him
.
Each
floor
had
a
door
opening
into
the
air
under
a
*NL*
cat-head
,
from
which
a
chain
dangled
for
hoisting
the
sacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Elizabeth
's
head
rose
through
the
trap
she
perceived
that
the
upper
*NL*
door
was
open
,
and
that
her
stepfather
and
Farfrae
stood
just
within
it
*NL*
in
conversation
,
Farfrae
being
nearest
the
dizzy
edge
,
and
Henchard
*NL*
a
little
way
behind
.
Not
to
interrupt
them
she
remained
on
the
steps
*NL*
without
raising
her
head
any
higher
.
While
waiting
thus
she
saw
--
or
*NL*
fancied
she
saw
,
for
she
had
a
terror
of
feeling
certain
--
her
stepfather
*NL*
slowly
raise
his
hand
to
a
level
behind
Farfrae
's
shoulders
,
a
curious
*NL*
expression
taking
possession
of
his
face
.
The
young
man
was
quite
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
action
,
which
was
so
indirect
that
,
if
Farfrae
had
*NL*
observed
it
,
he
might
almost
have
regarded
it
as
an
idle
outstretching
*NL*
of
the
arm
.
But
it
would
have
been
possible
,
by
a
comparatively
light
*NL*
touch
,
to
push
Farfrae
off
his
balance
,
and
send
him
head
over
heels
*NL*
into
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
felt
quite
sick
at
heart
on
thinking
of
what
this
MIGHT
have
*NL*
meant
.
As
soon
as
they
turned
she
mechanically
took
the
tea
to
Henchard
,
*NL*
left
it
,
and
went
away
.
Reflecting
,
she
endeavoured
to
assure
herself
*NL*
that
the
movement
was
an
idle
eccentricity
,
and
no
more
.
Yet
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
his
subordinate
position
in
an
establishment
where
he
once
*NL*
had
been
master
might
be
acting
on
him
like
an
irritant
poison
;
and
she
*NL*
finally
resolved
to
caution
Donald
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
34
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
accordingly
,
she
rose
at
five
o'clock
and
went
into
the
*NL*
street
.
It
was
not
yet
light
;
a
dense
fog
prevailed
,
and
the
town
was
*NL*
as
silent
as
it
was
dark
,
except
that
from
the
rectangular
avenues
which
*NL*
framed
in
the
borough
there
came
a
chorus
of
tiny
rappings
,
caused
by
*NL*
the
fall
of
water-drops
condensed
on
the
boughs
;
now
it
was
wafted
from
*NL*
the
West
Walk
,
now
from
the
South
Walk
;
and
then
from
both
quarters
*NL*
simultaneously
.
She
moved
on
to
the
bottom
of
Corn
Street
,
and
,
knowing
*NL*
his
time
well
,
waited
only
a
few
minutes
before
she
heard
the
familiar
*NL*
bang
of
his
door
,
and
then
his
quick
walk
towards
her
.
She
met
him
at
*NL*
the
point
where
the
last
tree
of
the
engirding
avenue
flanked
the
last
*NL*
house
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hardly
discern
her
till
,
glancing
inquiringly
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
What
--
Miss
Henchard
--
and
are
ye
up
so
airly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
to
pardon
her
for
waylaying
him
at
such
an
unseemly
time
.
*NL*
``
But
I
am
anxious
to
mention
something
,
''
she
said
.
``
And
I
wished
not
to
*NL*
alarm
Mrs.
Farfrae
by
calling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
said
he
,
with
the
cheeriness
of
a
superior
.
``
And
what
may
it
be
?
*NL*
It
's
very
kind
of
ye
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
felt
the
difficulty
of
conveying
to
his
mind
the
exact
aspect
*NL*
of
possibilities
in
her
own
.
But
she
somehow
began
,
and
introduced
*NL*
Henchard
's
name
.
``
I
sometimes
fear
,
''
she
said
with
an
effort
,
``
that
he
*NL*
may
be
betrayed
into
some
attempt
to
--
insult
you
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
are
the
best
of
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
to
play
some
practical
joke
upon
you
,
sir
.
Remember
that
he
has
been
*NL*
hardly
used
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
are
quite
friendly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
to
do
something
--
that
would
injure
you
--
hurt
you
--
wound
you
.
''
Every
*NL*
word
cost
her
twice
its
length
of
pain
.
And
she
could
see
that
Farfrae
*NL*
was
still
incredulous
.
Henchard
,
a
poor
man
in
his
employ
,
was
not
to
*NL*
Farfrae
's
view
the
Henchard
who
had
ruled
him
.
Yet
he
was
not
only
the
*NL*
same
man
,
but
that
man
with
his
sinister
qualities
,
formerly
latent
,
*NL*
quickened
into
life
by
his
buffetings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
,
happy
,
and
thinking
no
evil
,
persisted
in
making
light
of
her
*NL*
fears
.
Thus
they
parted
,
and
she
went
homeward
,
journeymen
now
being
in
*NL*
the
street
,
waggoners
going
to
the
harness-makers
for
articles
left
to
*NL*
be
repaired
,
farm-horses
going
to
the
shoeing-smiths
,
and
the
sons
of
*NL*
labour
showing
themselves
generally
on
the
move
.
Elizabeth
entered
her
*NL*
lodging
unhappily
,
thinking
she
had
done
no
good
,
and
only
made
herself
*NL*
appear
foolish
by
her
weak
note
of
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Donald
Farfrae
was
one
of
those
men
upon
whom
an
incident
is
never
*NL*
absolutely
lost
.
He
revised
impressions
from
a
subsequent
point
of
view
,
*NL*
and
the
impulsive
judgment
of
the
moment
was
not
always
his
permanent
*NL*
one
.
The
vision
of
Elizabeth
's
earnest
face
in
the
rimy
dawn
came
*NL*
back
to
him
several
times
during
the
day
.
Knowing
the
solidity
of
her
*NL*
character
he
did
not
treat
her
hints
altogether
as
idle
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
desist
from
a
kindly
scheme
on
Henchard
's
account
that
*NL*
engaged
him
just
then
;
and
when
he
met
Lawyer
Joyce
,
the
town-clerk
,
*NL*
later
in
the
day
,
he
spoke
of
it
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
damp
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
that
little
seedsman
's
shop
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
shop
overlooking
the
*NL*
churchyard
,
which
is
to
let
.
It
is
not
for
myself
I
want
it
,
but
for
our
*NL*
unlucky
fellow-townsman
Henchard
.
It
would
be
a
new
beginning
for
him
,
*NL*
if
a
small
one
;
and
I
have
told
the
Council
that
I
would
head
a
private
*NL*
subscription
among
them
to
set
him
up
in
it
--
that
I
would
be
fifty
*NL*
pounds
,
if
they
would
make
up
the
other
fifty
among
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
so
I
've
heard
;
and
there
's
nothing
to
say
against
it
for
that
*NL*
matter
,
''
the
town-clerk
replied
,
in
his
plain
,
frank
way
.
``
But
,
Farfrae
,
*NL*
others
see
what
you
do
n't
.
Henchard
hates
`
ee
--
ay
,
hates
`
ee
;
and
't
is
*NL*
right
that
you
should
know
it
.
To
my
knowledge
he
was
at
the
Three
*NL*
Mariners
last
night
,
saying
in
public
that
about
you
which
a
man
ought
*NL*
not
to
say
about
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
--
ah
,
is
that
so
?
''
said
Farfrae
,
looking
down
.
``
Why
should
he
*NL*
do
it
?
''
added
the
young
man
bitterly
;
``
what
harm
have
I
done
him
that
he
*NL*
should
try
to
wrong
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
only
knows
,
''
said
Joyce
,
lifting
his
eyebrows
.
``
It
shows
much
*NL*
long-suffering
in
you
to
put
up
with
him
,
and
keep
him
in
your
employ
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
cannet
discharge
a
man
who
was
once
a
good
friend
to
me
.
How
can
*NL*
I
forget
that
when
I
came
here
't
was
he
enabled
me
to
make
a
footing
for
*NL*
mysel
'
?
No
,
no
.
As
long
as
I
've
a
day
's
work
to
offer
he
shall
do
it
if
*NL*
he
chooses
.
'T
is
not
I
who
will
deny
him
such
a
little
as
that
.
But
I
'll
*NL*
drop
the
idea
of
establishing
him
in
a
shop
till
I
can
think
more
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
grieved
Farfrae
much
to
give
up
this
scheme
.
But
a
damp
having
*NL*
been
thrown
over
it
by
these
and
other
voices
in
the
air
,
he
went
and
*NL*
countermanded
his
orders
.
The
then
occupier
of
the
shop
was
in
it
when
*NL*
Farfrae
spoke
to
him
and
feeling
it
necessary
to
give
some
explanation
*NL*
of
his
withdrawal
from
the
negotiation
Donald
mentioned
Henchard
's
name
,
*NL*
and
stated
that
the
intentions
of
the
Council
had
been
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
occupier
was
much
disappointed
,
and
straight-way
informed
Henchard
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
,
that
a
scheme
of
the
Council
for
setting
him
up
*NL*
in
a
shop
had
been
knocked
on
the
head
by
Farfrae
.
And
thus
out
of
error
*NL*
enmity
grew
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Farfrae
got
indoors
that
evening
the
tea-kettle
was
singing
on
the
*NL*
high
hob
of
the
semi-egg-shaped
grate
.
Lucetta
,
light
as
a
sylph
,
ran
*NL*
forward
and
seized
his
hands
,
whereupon
Farfrae
duly
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
cried
playfully
,
turning
to
the
window
.
``
See
--
the
blinds
are
*NL*
not
drawn
down
,
and
the
people
can
look
in
--
what
a
scandal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
candles
were
lighted
,
the
curtains
drawn
,
and
the
twain
sat
at
*NL*
tea
,
she
noticed
that
he
looked
serious
.
Without
directly
inquiring
why
*NL*
she
let
her
eyes
linger
solicitously
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
called
?
''
he
absently
asked
.
``
Any
folk
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Donald
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
nothing
worth
talking
of
,
''
he
responded
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
never
mind
it
.
You
will
get
through
it
,
Scotchmen
are
always
*NL*
lucky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
always
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
gloomily
as
he
contemplated
*NL*
a
crumb
on
the
table
.
``
I
know
many
who
have
not
been
so
!
There
was
*NL*
Sandy
Macfarlane
,
who
started
to
America
to
try
his
fortune
,
and
he
was
*NL*
drowned
;
and
Archibald
Leith
,
he
was
murdered
!
And
poor
Willie
Dunbleeze
*NL*
and
Maitland
Macfreeze
--
they
fell
into
bad
courses
,
and
went
the
way
of
*NL*
all
such
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
you
old
goosey
--
I
was
only
speaking
in
a
general
sense
,
of
course
!
*NL*
You
are
always
so
literal
.
Now
when
we
have
finished
tea
,
sing
me
*NL*
that
funny
song
about
high-heeled
shoon
and
siller
tags
,
and
the
*NL*
one-and-forty
wooers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
I
couldna
sing
to-night
!
It
's
Henchard
--
he
hates
me
;
so
that
I
*NL*
may
not
be
his
friend
if
I
would
.
I
would
understand
why
there
should
be
*NL*
a
wee
bit
of
envy
;
but
I
cannet
see
a
reason
for
the
whole
intensity
*NL*
of
what
he
feels
.
Now
,
can
you
,
Lucetta
?
It
is
more
like
old-fashioned
*NL*
rivalry
in
love
than
just
a
bit
of
rivalry
in
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
had
grown
somewhat
wan
.
``
No
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
him
employment
--
I
cannet
refuse
it
.
But
neither
can
I
blind
*NL*
myself
to
the
fact
that
with
a
man
of
passions
such
as
his
,
there
is
no
*NL*
safeguard
for
conduct
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
heard
--
O
Donald
,
dearest
?
''
said
Lucetta
in
alarm
.
The
*NL*
words
on
her
lips
were
``
anything
about
me
?
''
--
but
she
did
not
utter
them
.
*NL*
She
could
not
,
however
,
suppress
her
agitation
,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
it
is
not
so
serious
as
ye
fancy
,
''
declared
Farfrae
soothingly
;
*NL*
though
he
did
not
know
its
seriousness
so
well
as
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
do
what
we
have
talked
of
,
''
mournfully
remarked
*NL*
Lucetta
.
``
Give
up
business
,
and
go
away
from
here
.
We
have
plenty
of
*NL*
money
,
and
why
should
we
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
seemed
seriously
disposed
to
discuss
this
move
,
and
they
talked
*NL*
thereon
till
a
visitor
was
announced
.
Their
neighbour
Alderman
Vatt
came
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
heard
,
I
suppose
of
poor
Doctor
Chalkfield
's
death
?
Yes
--
died
*NL*
this
afternoon
at
five
,
''
said
Mr.
Vatt
.
Chalkfield
was
the
Councilman
who
*NL*
had
succeeded
to
the
Mayoralty
in
the
preceding
November
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
was
sorry
at
the
intelligence
,
and
Mr.
Vatt
continued
:
``
Well
,
we
*NL*
know
he
's
been
going
some
days
,
and
as
his
family
is
well
provided
for
*NL*
we
must
take
it
all
as
it
is
.
Now
I
have
called
to
ask
`
ee
this
--
quite
*NL*
privately
.
If
I
should
nominate
`
ee
to
succeed
him
,
and
there
should
be
*NL*
no
particular
opposition
,
will
`
ee
accept
the
chair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
are
folk
whose
turn
is
before
mine
;
and
I
'm
over
young
,
and
*NL*
may
be
thought
pushing
!
''
said
Farfrae
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
I
do
n't
speak
for
myself
only
,
several
have
named
it
.
You
*NL*
wo
n't
refuse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
of
going
away
,
''
interposed
Lucetta
,
looking
at
Farfrae
*NL*
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
only
a
fancy
,
''
Farfrae
murmured
.
``
I
wouldna
refuse
if
it
is
the
*NL*
wish
of
a
respectable
majority
in
the
Council
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
look
upon
yourself
as
elected
.
We
have
had
older
men
*NL*
long
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
Farfrae
said
musingly
,
``
See
now
how
it
's
ourselves
that
*NL*
are
ruled
by
the
Powers
above
us
!
We
plan
this
,
but
we
do
that
.
If
they
*NL*
want
to
make
me
Mayor
I
will
stay
,
and
Henchard
must
rave
as
he
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
evening
onward
Lucetta
was
very
uneasy
.
If
she
had
not
been
*NL*
imprudence
incarnate
she
would
not
have
acted
as
she
did
when
she
met
*NL*
Henchard
by
accident
a
day
or
two
later
.
It
was
in
the
bustle
of
the
*NL*
market
,
when
no
one
could
readily
notice
their
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Michael
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
must
again
ask
you
what
I
asked
you
months
*NL*
ago
--
to
return
me
any
letters
or
papers
of
mine
that
you
may
*NL*
have
--
unless
you
have
destroyed
them
?
You
must
see
how
desirable
it
*NL*
is
that
the
time
at
Jersey
should
be
blotted
out
,
for
the
good
of
all
*NL*
parties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
the
woman
!
--
I
packed
up
every
scrap
of
your
handwriting
to
*NL*
give
you
in
the
coach
--
but
you
never
appeared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
explained
how
the
death
of
her
aunt
had
prevented
her
taking
the
*NL*
journey
on
that
day
.
``
And
what
became
of
the
parcel
then
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
say
--
he
would
consider
.
When
she
was
gone
he
recollected
*NL*
that
he
had
left
a
heap
of
useless
papers
in
his
former
dining-room
*NL*
safe
--
built
up
in
the
wall
of
his
old
house
--
now
occupied
by
Farfrae
.
*NL*
The
letters
might
have
been
amongst
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
grotesque
grin
shaped
itself
on
Henchard
's
face
.
Had
that
safe
been
*NL*
opened

*NL*
On
the
very
evening
which
followed
this
there
was
a
great
ringing
of
*NL*
bells
in
Casterbridge
,
and
the
combined
brass
,
wood
,
catgut
,
and
leather
*NL*
bands
played
round
the
town
with
more
prodigality
of
percussion-notes
*NL*
than
ever
.
Farfrae
was
Mayor
--
the
two-hundredth
odd
of
a
series
forming
*NL*
an
elective
dynasty
dating
back
to
the
days
of
Charles
I
--
and
the
*NL*
fair
Lucetta
was
the
courted
of
the
town
...
But
,
Ah
!
the
worm
i
'
the
*NL*
bud
--
Henchard
;
what
he
could
tell
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
in
the
meantime
,
festering
with
indignation
at
some
erroneous
*NL*
intelligence
of
Farfrae
's
opposition
to
the
scheme
for
installing
him
*NL*
in
the
little
seed-shop
,
was
greeted
with
the
news
of
the
municipal
*NL*
election
-LRB-
which
,
by
reason
of
Farfrae
's
comparative
youth
and
his
*NL*
Scottish
nativity
--
a
thing
unprecedented
in
the
case
--
had
an
interest
*NL*
far
beyond
the
ordinary
-RRB-
.
The
bell-ringing
and
the
band-playing
,
loud
as
*NL*
Tamerlane
's
trumpet
,
goaded
the
downfallen
Henchard
indescribably
:
the
*NL*
ousting
now
seemed
to
him
to
be
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
went
to
the
corn-yard
as
usual
,
and
about
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
Donald
entered
through
the
green
door
,
with
no
trace
of
the
*NL*
worshipful
about
him
.
The
yet
more
emphatic
change
of
places
between
*NL*
him
and
Henchard
which
this
election
had
established
renewed
a
slight
*NL*
embarrassment
in
the
manner
of
the
modest
young
man
;
but
Henchard
*NL*
showed
the
front
of
one
who
had
overlooked
all
this
;
and
Farfrae
met
his
*NL*
amenities
half-way
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
ask
you
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
about
a
packet
that
I
*NL*
may
possibly
have
left
in
my
old
safe
in
the
dining-room
.
''
He
added
*NL*
particulars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
it
is
there
now
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
I
have
never
opened
the
safe
at
*NL*
all
as
yet
;
for
I
keep
ma
papers
at
the
bank
,
to
sleep
easy
o
'
nights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
of
much
consequence
--
to
me
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
But
I
'll
call
*NL*
for
it
this
evening
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
late
when
he
fulfilled
his
promise
.
He
had
primed
himself
*NL*
with
grog
,
as
he
did
very
frequently
now
,
and
a
curl
of
sardonic
*NL*
humour
hung
on
his
lip
as
he
approached
the
house
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
contemplating
some
terrible
form
of
amusement
.
Whatever
it
was
,
the
*NL*
incident
of
his
entry
did
not
diminish
its
force
,
this
being
his
first
*NL*
visit
to
the
house
since
he
had
lived
there
as
owner
.
The
ring
of
the
*NL*
bell
spoke
to
him
like
the
voice
of
a
familiar
drudge
who
had
been
*NL*
bribed
to
forsake
him
;
the
movements
of
the
doors
were
revivals
of
dead
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
invited
him
into
the
dining-room
,
where
he
at
once
unlocked
*NL*
the
iron
safe
built
into
the
wall
,
HIS
,
Henchard
's
safe
,
made
by
an
*NL*
ingenious
locksmith
under
his
direction
.
Farfrae
drew
thence
the
parcel
,
*NL*
and
other
papers
,
with
apologies
for
not
having
returned
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Henchard
drily
.
``
The
fact
is
they
are
letters
*NL*
mostly
...
Yes
,
''
he
went
on
,
sitting
down
and
unfolding
Lucetta
's
*NL*
passionate
bundle
,
``
here
they
be
.
That
ever
I
should
see
'em
again
!
I
*NL*
hope
Mrs.
Farfrae
is
well
after
her
exertions
of
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
felt
a
bit
weary
;
and
has
gone
to
bed
airly
on
that
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
returned
to
the
letters
,
sorting
them
over
with
interest
,
*NL*
Farfrae
being
seated
at
the
other
end
of
the
dining-table
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
forget
,
of
course
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
that
curious
chapter
in
the
history
of
*NL*
my
past
which
I
told
you
of
,
and
that
you
gave
me
some
assistance
in
?
*NL*
These
letters
are
,
in
fact
,
related
to
that
unhappy
business
.
Though
,
*NL*
thank
God
,
it
is
all
over
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
became
of
the
poor
woman
?
''
asked
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luckily
she
married
,
and
married
well
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
So
that
these
*NL*
reproaches
she
poured
out
on
me
do
not
now
cause
me
any
twinges
,
as
they
*NL*
might
otherwise
have
done
...
Just
listen
to
what
an
angry
woman
will
*NL*
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
,
willing
to
humour
Henchard
,
though
quite
uninterested
,
and
*NL*
bursting
with
yawns
,
gave
well-mannered
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
For
me
,
'
''
Henchard
read
,
''
`
there
is
practically
no
future
.
A
creature
*NL*
too
unconventionally
devoted
to
you
--
who
feels
it
impossible
that
she
*NL*
can
be
the
wife
of
any
other
man
;
and
who
is
yet
no
more
to
you
than
the
*NL*
first
woman
you
meet
in
the
street
--
such
am
I.
I
quite
acquit
you
of
any
*NL*
intention
to
wrong
me
,
yet
you
are
the
door
through
which
wrong
has
come
*NL*
to
me
.
That
in
the
event
of
your
present
wife
's
death
you
will
place
me
*NL*
in
her
position
is
a
consolation
so
far
as
it
goes
--
but
how
far
does
it
*NL*
go
?
Thus
I
sit
here
,
forsaken
by
my
few
acquaintance
,
and
forsaken
by
*NL*
you
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
she
went
on
to
me
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
acres
of
words
like
*NL*
that
,
when
what
had
happened
was
what
I
could
not
cure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Farfrae
absently
,
``
it
is
the
way
wi
'
women
.
''
But
the
*NL*
fact
was
that
he
knew
very
little
of
the
sex
;
yet
detecting
a
sort
of
*NL*
resemblance
in
style
between
the
effusions
of
the
woman
he
worshipped
*NL*
and
those
of
the
supposed
stranger
,
he
concluded
that
Aphrodite
ever
*NL*
spoke
thus
,
whosesoever
the
personality
she
assumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
unfolded
another
letter
,
and
read
it
through
likewise
,
stopping
*NL*
at
the
subscription
as
before
.
``
Her
name
I
do
n't
give
,
''
he
said
blandly
.
*NL*
``
As
I
did
n't
marry
her
,
and
another
man
did
,
I
can
scarcely
do
that
in
*NL*
fairness
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tr-rue
,
tr-rue
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
But
why
did
n't
you
marry
her
when
your
*NL*
wife
Susan
died
?
''
Farfrae
asked
this
and
the
other
questions
in
the
*NL*
comfortably
indifferent
tone
of
one
whom
the
matter
very
remotely
*NL*
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
well
you
may
ask
that
!
''
said
Henchard
,
the
new-moon-shaped
*NL*
grin
adumbrating
itself
again
upon
his
mouth
.
``
In
spite
of
all
her
*NL*
protestations
,
when
I
came
forward
to
do
so
,
as
in
generosity
bound
,
she
*NL*
was
not
the
woman
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
already
married
another
--
maybe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
sailing
too
near
the
wind
to
*NL*
descend
further
into
particulars
,
and
he
answered
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
lady
must
have
had
a
heart
that
bore
transplanting
very
*NL*
readily
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
,
she
had
,
''
said
Henchard
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
a
third
and
fourth
letter
,
and
read
.
This
time
he
approached
*NL*
the
conclusion
as
if
the
signature
were
indeed
coming
with
the
rest
.
But
*NL*
again
he
stopped
short
.
The
truth
was
that
,
as
may
be
divined
,
he
had
*NL*
quite
intended
to
effect
a
grand
catastrophe
at
the
end
of
this
drama
*NL*
by
reading
out
the
name
,
he
had
come
to
the
house
with
no
other
thought
.
*NL*
But
sitting
here
in
cold
blood
he
could
not
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
wrecking
of
hearts
appalled
even
him
.
His
quality
was
such
*NL*
that
he
could
have
annihilated
them
both
in
the
heat
of
action
;
but
to
*NL*
accomplish
the
deed
by
oral
poison
was
beyond
the
nerve
of
his
enmity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Donald
stated
,
Lucetta
had
retired
early
to
her
room
because
of
*NL*
fatigue
.
She
had
,
however
,
not
gone
to
rest
,
but
sat
in
the
bedside
*NL*
chair
reading
and
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
day
.
At
the
ringing
of
*NL*
the
door-bell
by
Henchard
she
wondered
who
it
should
be
that
would
call
*NL*
at
that
comparatively
late
hour
.
The
dining-room
was
almost
under
her
*NL*
bed-room
;
she
could
hear
that
somebody
was
admitted
there
,
and
presently
*NL*
the
indistinct
murmur
of
a
person
reading
became
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usual
time
for
Donald
's
arrival
upstairs
came
and
passed
,
yet
still
*NL*
the
reading
and
conversation
went
on
.
This
was
very
singular
.
She
could
*NL*
think
of
nothing
but
that
some
extraordinary
crime
had
been
committed
,
*NL*
and
that
the
visitor
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
was
reading
an
account
of
it
*NL*
from
a
special
edition
of
the
Casterbridge
Chronicle
.
At
last
she
left
*NL*
the
room
,
and
descended
the
stairs
.
The
dining-room
door
was
ajar
,
and
*NL*
in
the
silence
of
the
resting
household
the
voice
and
the
words
were
*NL*
recognizable
before
she
reached
the
lower
flight
.
She
stood
transfixed
.
*NL*
Her
own
words
greeted
her
in
Henchard
's
voice
,
like
spirits
from
the
*NL*
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
leant
upon
the
banister
with
her
cheek
against
the
smooth
*NL*
hand-rail
,
as
if
she
would
make
a
friend
of
it
in
her
misery
.
Rigid
in
*NL*
this
position
,
more
and
more
words
fell
successively
upon
her
ear
.
But
*NL*
what
amazed
her
most
was
the
tone
of
her
husband
.
He
spoke
merely
in
the
*NL*
accents
of
a
man
who
made
a
present
of
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
,
''
he
was
saying
,
as
the
crackling
of
paper
denoted
that
*NL*
Henchard
was
unfolding
yet
another
sheet
.
``
Is
it
quite
fair
to
this
*NL*
young
woman
's
memory
to
read
at
such
length
to
a
stranger
what
was
*NL*
intended
for
your
eye
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
By
not
giving
her
name
I
make
it
an
example
*NL*
of
all
womankind
,
and
not
a
scandal
to
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
I
would
destroy
them
,
''
said
Farfrae
,
giving
more
thought
*NL*
to
the
letters
than
he
had
hitherto
done
.
``
As
another
man
's
wife
it
*NL*
would
injure
the
woman
if
it
were
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
shall
not
destroy
them
,
''
murmured
Henchard
,
putting
the
letters
*NL*
away
.
Then
he
arose
,
and
Lucetta
heard
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
back
to
her
bedroom
in
a
semi-paralyzed
state
.
For
very
fear
*NL*
she
could
not
undress
,
but
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
waiting
.
Would
*NL*
Henchard
let
out
the
secret
in
his
parting
words
?
Her
suspense
was
*NL*
terrible
.
Had
she
confessed
all
to
Donald
in
their
early
acquaintance
he
*NL*
might
possibly
have
got
over
it
,
and
married
her
just
the
same
--
unlikely
*NL*
as
it
had
once
seemed
;
but
for
her
or
any
one
else
to
tell
him
now
would
*NL*
be
fatal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
slammed
;
she
could
hear
her
husband
bolting
it
.
After
looking
*NL*
round
in
his
customary
way
he
came
leisurely
up
the
stairs
.
The
spark
in
*NL*
her
eyes
well-nigh
went
out
when
he
appeared
round
the
bedroom
door
.
Her
*NL*
gaze
hung
doubtful
for
a
moment
,
then
to
her
joyous
amazement
she
saw
*NL*
that
he
looked
at
her
with
the
rallying
smile
of
one
who
had
just
been
*NL*
relieved
of
a
scene
that
was
irksome
.
She
could
hold
out
no
longer
,
and
*NL*
sobbed
hysterically
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
restored
her
Farfrae
naturally
enough
spoke
of
Henchard
.
``
Of
*NL*
all
men
he
was
the
least
desirable
as
a
visitor
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
it
is
my
*NL*
belief
that
he
's
just
a
bit
crazed
.
He
has
been
reading
to
me
a
long
*NL*
lot
of
letters
relating
to
his
past
life
;
and
I
could
do
no
less
than
*NL*
indulge
him
by
listening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
sufficient
.
Henchard
,
then
,
had
not
told
.
Henchard
's
last
*NL*
words
to
Farfrae
,
in
short
,
as
he
stood
on
the
doorstep
,
had
been
these
:
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
'm
obliged
to
`
ee
for
listening
.
I
may
tell
more
about
her
some
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
this
,
she
was
much
perplexed
as
to
Henchard
's
motives
in
opening
*NL*
the
matter
at
all
;
for
in
such
cases
we
attribute
to
an
enemy
a
power
*NL*
of
consistent
action
which
we
never
find
in
ourselves
or
in
our
friends
;
*NL*
and
forget
that
abortive
efforts
from
want
of
heart
are
as
possible
to
*NL*
revenge
as
to
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
Lucetta
remained
in
bed
,
meditating
how
to
parry
this
*NL*
incipient
attack
.
The
bold
stroke
of
telling
Donald
the
truth
,
dimly
*NL*
conceived
,
was
yet
too
bold
;
for
she
dreaded
lest
in
doing
so
he
,
like
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
world
,
should
believe
that
the
episode
was
rather
her
*NL*
fault
than
her
misfortune
.
She
decided
to
employ
persuasion
--
not
with
*NL*
Donald
but
with
the
enemy
himself
.
It
seemed
the
only
practicable
weapon
*NL*
left
her
as
a
woman
.
Having
laid
her
plan
she
rose
,
and
wrote
to
him
who
*NL*
kept
her
on
these
tenterhooks
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
overheard
your
interview
with
my
husband
last
night
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
drift
of
your
revenge
.
The
very
thought
of
it
crushes
me
!
Have
pity
on
a
*NL*
distressed
woman
!
If
you
could
see
me
you
would
relent
.
You
do
not
know
*NL*
how
anxiety
has
told
upon
me
lately
.
I
will
be
at
the
Ring
at
the
time
*NL*
you
leave
work
--
just
before
the
sun
goes
down
.
Please
come
that
way
.
I
*NL*
can
not
rest
till
I
have
seen
you
face
to
face
,
and
heard
from
your
mouth
*NL*
that
you
will
carry
this
horse-play
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
herself
she
said
,
on
closing
up
her
appeal
:
``
If
ever
tears
and
*NL*
pleadings
have
served
the
weak
to
fight
the
strong
,
let
them
do
so
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
view
she
made
a
toilette
which
differed
from
all
she
had
ever
*NL*
attempted
before
.
To
heighten
her
natural
attraction
had
hitherto
been
*NL*
the
unvarying
endeavour
of
her
adult
life
,
and
one
in
which
she
was
no
*NL*
novice
.
But
now
she
neglected
this
,
and
even
proceeded
to
impair
the
*NL*
natural
presentation
.
Beyond
a
natural
reason
for
her
slightly
drawn
*NL*
look
,
she
had
not
slept
all
the
previous
night
,
and
this
had
produced
*NL*
upon
her
pretty
though
slightly
worn
features
the
aspect
of
a
*NL*
countenance
ageing
prematurely
from
extreme
sorrow
.
She
selected
--
as
*NL*
much
from
want
of
spirit
as
design
--
her
poorest
,
plainest
and
longest
*NL*
discarded
attire
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
the
contingency
of
being
recognized
she
veiled
herself
,
and
*NL*
slipped
out
of
the
house
quickly
.
The
sun
was
resting
on
the
hill
like
a
*NL*
drop
of
blood
on
an
eyelid
by
the
time
she
had
got
up
the
road
opposite
*NL*
the
amphitheatre
,
which
she
speedily
entered
.
The
interior
was
shadowy
,
*NL*
and
emphatic
of
the
absence
of
every
living
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
disappointed
in
the
fearful
hope
with
which
she
awaited
him
.
*NL*
Henchard
came
over
the
top
,
descended
and
Lucetta
waited
breathlessly
.
*NL*
But
having
reached
the
arena
she
saw
a
change
in
his
bearing
:
he
stood
*NL*
still
at
a
little
distance
from
her
;
she
could
not
think
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
could
any
one
else
have
known
.
The
truth
was
that
in
appointing
this
*NL*
spot
,
and
this
hour
,
for
the
rendezvous
,
Lucetta
had
unwittingly
backed
*NL*
up
her
entreaty
by
the
strongest
argument
she
could
have
used
outside
*NL*
words
,
with
this
man
of
moods
,
glooms
,
and
superstitions
.
Her
figure
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
huge
enclosure
,
the
unusual
plainness
of
her
dress
,
her
*NL*
attitude
of
hope
and
appeal
,
so
strongly
revived
in
his
soul
the
memory
*NL*
of
another
ill-used
woman
who
had
stood
there
and
thus
in
bygone
days
,
*NL*
and
had
now
passed
away
into
her
rest
,
that
he
was
unmanned
,
and
his
*NL*
heart
smote
him
for
having
attempted
reprisals
on
one
of
a
sex
so
weak
.
*NL*
When
he
approached
her
,
and
before
she
had
spoken
a
word
,
her
point
was
*NL*
half
gained
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
manner
as
he
had
come
down
had
been
one
of
cynical
carelessness
;
but
*NL*
he
now
put
away
his
grim
half-smile
,
and
said
,
in
a
kindly
subdued
tone
,
*NL*
``
Goodnight
t
`
ye
.
Of
course
I
'm
glad
to
come
if
you
want
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
thank
you
,
''
she
said
apprehensively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
see
`
ee
looking
so
ill
,
''
he
stammered
with
unconcealed
*NL*
compunction
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
How
can
you
be
sorry
,
''
she
asked
,
``
when
you
*NL*
deliberately
cause
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Henchard
uneasily
.
``
Is
it
anything
I
have
done
that
has
*NL*
pulled
you
down
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
your
doing
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
no
other
grief
.
My
happiness
*NL*
would
be
secure
enough
but
for
your
threats
.
O
Michael
!
do
n't
wreck
me
*NL*
like
this
!
You
might
think
that
you
have
done
enough
!
When
I
came
here
*NL*
I
was
a
young
woman
;
now
I
am
rapidly
becoming
an
old
one
.
Neither
my
*NL*
husband
nor
any
other
man
will
regard
me
with
interest
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
was
disarmed
.
His
old
feeling
of
supercilious
pity
for
*NL*
womankind
in
general
was
intensified
by
this
suppliant
appearing
here
*NL*
as
the
double
of
the
first
.
Moreover
that
thoughtless
want
of
foresight
*NL*
which
had
led
to
all
her
trouble
remained
with
poor
Lucetta
still
;
she
*NL*
had
come
to
meet
him
here
in
this
compromising
way
without
perceiving
*NL*
the
risk
.
Such
a
woman
was
very
small
deer
to
hunt
;
he
felt
ashamed
,
*NL*
lost
all
zest
and
desire
to
humiliate
Lucetta
there
and
then
,
and
no
*NL*
longer
envied
Farfrae
his
bargain
.
He
had
married
money
,
but
nothing
*NL*
more
.
Henchard
was
anxious
to
wash
his
hands
of
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
?
''
he
said
gently
.
``
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
*NL*
very
willing
.
My
reading
of
those
letters
was
only
a
sort
of
practical
*NL*
joke
,
and
I
revealed
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
give
me
back
the
letters
and
any
papers
you
may
have
that
breathe
of
*NL*
matrimony
or
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
.
Every
scrap
shall
be
yours
...
But
,
between
you
and
me
,
*NL*
Lucetta
,
he
is
sure
to
find
out
something
of
the
matter
,
sooner
or
*NL*
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
said
with
eager
tremulousness
;
``
but
not
till
I
have
proved
*NL*
myself
a
faithful
and
deserving
wife
to
him
,
and
then
he
may
forgive
me
*NL*
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
silently
looked
at
her
:
he
almost
envied
Farfrae
such
love
*NL*
as
that
,
even
now
.
``
H
'm
--
I
hope
so
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
you
shall
have
the
*NL*
letters
without
fail
.
And
your
secret
shall
be
kept
.
I
swear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
you
are
!
--
how
shall
I
get
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
,
and
said
he
would
send
them
the
next
morning
.
``
Now
do
n't
*NL*
doubt
me
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
can
keep
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
36
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
from
her
appointment
Lucetta
saw
a
man
waiting
by
the
lamp
*NL*
nearest
to
her
own
door
.
When
she
stopped
to
go
in
he
came
and
spoke
to
*NL*
her
.
It
was
Jopp
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
begged
her
pardon
for
addressing
her
.
But
he
had
heard
that
Mr.
*NL*
Farfrae
had
been
applied
to
by
a
neighbouring
corn-merchant
to
recommend
*NL*
a
working
partner
;
if
so
he
wished
to
offer
himself
.
He
could
give
good
*NL*
security
,
and
had
stated
as
much
to
Mr.
Farfrae
in
a
letter
;
but
he
*NL*
would
feel
much
obliged
if
Lucetta
would
say
a
word
in
his
favour
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
thing
I
know
nothing
about
,
''
said
Lucetta
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
testify
to
my
trustworthiness
better
than
anybody
,
ma'am
,
''
*NL*
said
Jopp
.
``
I
was
in
Jersey
several
years
,
and
knew
you
there
by
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
she
replied
.
``
But
I
knew
nothing
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
ma'am
,
that
a
word
or
two
from
you
would
secure
for
me
what
I
*NL*
covet
very
much
,
''
he
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
steadily
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
,
and
cutting
*NL*
him
short
,
because
of
her
anxiety
to
get
indoors
before
her
husband
*NL*
should
miss
her
,
left
him
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
her
till
she
had
vanished
,
and
then
went
home
.
When
he
got
*NL*
there
he
sat
down
in
the
fireless
chimney
corner
looking
at
the
iron
*NL*
dogs
,
and
the
wood
laid
across
them
for
heating
the
morning
kettle
.
*NL*
A
movement
upstairs
disturbed
him
,
and
Henchard
came
down
from
his
*NL*
bedroom
,
where
he
seemed
to
have
been
rummaging
boxes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
you
would
do
me
a
service
,
Jopp
,
*NL*
now
--
to-night
,
I
mean
,
if
you
can
.
Leave
this
at
Mrs.
Farfrae
's
for
her
.
*NL*
I
should
take
it
myself
,
of
course
,
but
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
seen
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
a
package
in
brown
paper
,
sealed
.
Henchard
had
been
as
good
*NL*
as
his
word
.
Immediately
on
coming
indoors
he
had
searched
over
his
few
*NL*
belongings
,
and
every
scrap
of
Lucetta
's
writing
that
he
possessed
was
*NL*
here
.
Jopp
indifferently
expressed
his
willingness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
have
ye
got
on
to-day
?
''
his
lodger
asked
.
``
Any
prospect
of
an
*NL*
opening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
not
,
''
said
Jopp
,
who
had
not
told
the
other
of
his
*NL*
application
to
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
will
be
in
Casterbridge
,
''
declared
Henchard
decisively
.
*NL*
``
You
must
roam
further
afield
.
''
He
said
goodnight
to
Jopp
,
and
returned
*NL*
to
his
own
part
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
sat
on
till
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
candle-snuff
on
the
wall
,
and
looking
at
the
original
he
found
that
it
*NL*
had
formed
itself
into
a
head
like
a
red-hot
cauliflower
.
Henchard
's
*NL*
packet
next
met
his
gaze
.
He
knew
there
had
been
something
of
the
nature
*NL*
of
wooing
between
Henchard
and
the
now
Mrs.
Farfrae
;
and
his
vague
ideas
*NL*
on
the
subject
narrowed
themselves
down
to
these
:
Henchard
had
a
parcel
*NL*
belonging
to
Mrs.
Farfrae
,
and
he
had
reasons
for
not
returning
that
*NL*
parcel
to
her
in
person
.
What
could
be
inside
it
?
So
he
went
on
and
on
*NL*
till
,
animated
by
resentment
at
Lucetta
's
haughtiness
,
as
he
thought
it
,
*NL*
and
curiosity
to
learn
if
there
were
any
weak
sides
to
this
transaction
*NL*
with
Henchard
,
he
examined
the
package
.
The
pen
and
all
its
relations
*NL*
being
awkward
tools
in
Henchard
's
hands
he
had
affixed
the
seals
without
*NL*
an
impression
,
it
never
occurring
to
him
that
the
efficacy
of
such
a
*NL*
fastening
depended
on
this
.
Jopp
was
far
less
of
a
tyro
;
he
lifted
one
*NL*
of
the
seals
with
his
penknife
,
peeped
in
at
the
end
thus
opened
,
saw
*NL*
that
the
bundle
consisted
of
letters
;
and
,
having
satisfied
himself
*NL*
thus
far
,
sealed
up
the
end
again
by
simply
softening
the
wax
with
the
*NL*
candle
,
and
went
off
with
the
parcel
as
requested
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
path
was
by
the
river-side
at
the
foot
of
the
town
.
Coming
into
*NL*
the
light
at
the
bridge
which
stood
at
the
end
of
High
Street
he
beheld
*NL*
lounging
thereon
Mother
Cuxsom
and
Nance
Mockridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
be
just
going
down
Mixen
Lane
way
,
to
look
into
Peter
's
Finger
afore
*NL*
creeping
to
bed
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cuxsom
.
``
There
's
a
fiddle
and
tambourine
*NL*
going
on
there
.
Lord
,
what
's
all
the
world
--
do
ye
come
along
too
,
*NL*
Jopp
--
`
two
n't
hinder
ye
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
had
mostly
kept
himself
out
of
this
company
,
but
present
*NL*
circumstances
made
him
somewhat
more
reckless
than
usual
,
and
without
*NL*
many
words
he
decided
to
go
to
his
destination
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
upper
part
of
Durnover
was
mainly
composed
of
a
curious
*NL*
congeries
of
barns
and
farm-steads
,
there
was
a
less
picturesque
side
to
*NL*
the
parish
.
This
was
Mixen
Lane
,
now
in
great
part
pulled
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mixen
Lane
was
the
Adullam
of
all
the
surrounding
villages
.
It
was
the
*NL*
hiding-place
of
those
who
were
in
distress
,
and
in
debt
,
and
trouble
*NL*
of
every
kind
.
Farm-labourers
and
other
peasants
,
who
combined
a
little
*NL*
poaching
with
their
farming
,
and
a
little
brawling
and
bibbing
with
*NL*
their
poaching
,
found
themselves
sooner
or
later
in
Mixen
Lane
.
Rural
*NL*
mechanics
too
idle
to
mechanize
,
rural
servants
too
rebellious
to
serve
,
*NL*
drifted
or
were
forced
into
Mixen
Lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lane
and
its
surrounding
thicket
of
thatched
cottages
stretched
out
*NL*
like
a
spit
into
the
moist
and
misty
lowland
.
Much
that
was
sad
,
much
*NL*
that
was
low
,
some
things
that
were
baneful
,
could
be
seen
in
*NL*
Mixen
Lane
.
Vice
ran
freely
in
and
out
certain
of
the
doors
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
;
recklessness
dwelt
under
the
roof
with
the
crooked
*NL*
chimney
;
shame
in
some
bow-windows
;
theft
-LRB-
in
times
of
privation
-RRB-
in
the
*NL*
thatched
and
mud-walled
houses
by
the
sallows
.
Even
slaughter
had
not
*NL*
been
altogether
unknown
here
.
In
a
block
of
cottages
up
an
alley
there
*NL*
might
have
been
erected
an
altar
to
disease
in
years
gone
by
.
Such
was
*NL*
Mixen
Lane
in
the
times
when
Henchard
and
Farfrae
were
Mayors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
this
mildewed
leaf
in
the
sturdy
and
flourishing
Casterbridge
plant
*NL*
lay
close
to
the
open
country
;
not
a
hundred
yards
from
a
row
of
*NL*
noble
elms
,
and
commanding
a
view
across
the
moor
of
airy
uplands
and
*NL*
corn-fields
,
and
mansions
of
the
great
.
A
brook
divided
the
moor
from
*NL*
the
tenements
,
and
to
outward
view
there
was
no
way
across
it
--
no
way
*NL*
to
the
houses
but
round
about
by
the
road
.
But
under
every
householder
's
*NL*
stairs
there
was
kept
a
mysterious
plank
nine
inches
wide
;
which
plank
*NL*
was
a
secret
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
,
as
one
of
those
refugee
householders
,
came
in
from
business
*NL*
after
dark
--
and
this
was
the
business
time
here
--
you
stealthily
crossed
*NL*
the
moor
,
approached
the
border
of
the
aforesaid
brook
,
and
whistled
*NL*
opposite
the
house
to
which
you
belonged
.
A
shape
thereupon
made
its
*NL*
appearance
on
the
other
side
bearing
the
bridge
on
end
against
the
sky
;
*NL*
it
was
lowered
;
you
crossed
,
and
a
hand
helped
you
to
land
yourself
,
*NL*
together
with
the
pheasants
and
hares
gathered
from
neighbouring
manors
.
*NL*
You
sold
them
slily
the
next
morning
,
and
the
day
after
you
stood
*NL*
before
the
magistrates
with
the
eyes
of
all
your
sympathizing
neighbours
*NL*
concentrated
on
your
back
.
You
disappeared
for
a
time
;
then
you
were
*NL*
again
found
quietly
living
in
Mixen
Lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
along
the
lane
at
dusk
the
stranger
was
struck
by
two
or
three
*NL*
peculiar
features
therein
.
One
was
an
intermittent
rumbling
from
the
*NL*
back
premises
of
the
inn
half-way
up
;
this
meant
a
skittle
alley
.
*NL*
Another
was
the
extensive
prevalence
of
whistling
in
the
various
*NL*
domiciles
--
a
piped
note
of
some
kind
coming
from
nearly
every
open
door
.
*NL*
Another
was
the
frequency
of
white
aprons
over
dingy
gowns
among
the
*NL*
women
around
the
doorways
.
A
white
apron
is
a
suspicious
vesture
in
*NL*
situations
where
spotlessness
is
difficult
;
moreover
,
the
industry
and
*NL*
cleanliness
which
the
white
apron
expressed
were
belied
by
the
postures
*NL*
and
gaits
of
the
women
who
wore
it
--
their
knuckles
being
mostly
on
their
*NL*
hips
-LRB-
an
attitude
which
lent
them
the
aspect
of
two-handled
mugs
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
their
shoulders
against
door-posts
;
while
there
was
a
curious
alacrity
*NL*
in
the
turn
of
each
honest
woman
's
head
upon
her
neck
and
in
the
twirl
*NL*
of
her
honest
eyes
,
at
any
noise
resembling
a
masculine
footfall
along
*NL*
the
lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
amid
so
much
that
was
bad
needy
respectability
also
found
a
home
.
*NL*
Under
some
of
the
roofs
abode
pure
and
virtuous
souls
whose
presence
*NL*
there
was
due
to
the
iron
hand
of
necessity
,
and
to
that
alone
.
Families
*NL*
from
decayed
villages
--
families
of
that
once
bulky
,
but
now
*NL*
nearly
extinct
,
section
of
village
society
called
``
liviers
,
''
or
*NL*
lifeholders
--
copyholders
and
others
,
whose
roof-trees
had
fallen
for
*NL*
some
reason
or
other
,
compelling
them
to
quit
the
rural
spot
that
had
*NL*
been
their
home
for
generations
--
came
here
,
unless
they
chose
to
lie
*NL*
under
a
hedge
by
the
wayside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn
called
Peter
's
Finger
was
the
church
of
Mixen
Lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
centrally
situate
,
as
such
places
should
be
,
and
bore
about
the
*NL*
same
social
relation
to
the
Three
Mariners
as
the
latter
bore
to
*NL*
the
King
's
Arms
.
At
first
sight
the
inn
was
so
respectable
as
to
be
*NL*
puzzling
.
The
front
door
was
kept
shut
,
and
the
step
was
so
clean
that
*NL*
evidently
but
few
persons
entered
over
its
sanded
surface
.
But
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
public-house
was
an
alley
,
a
mere
slit
,
dividing
it
from
*NL*
the
next
building
.
Half-way
up
the
alley
was
a
narrow
door
,
shiny
and
*NL*
paintless
from
the
rub
of
infinite
hands
and
shoulders
.
This
was
the
*NL*
actual
entrance
to
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pedestrian
would
be
seen
abstractedly
passing
along
Mixen
Lane
;
and
*NL*
then
,
in
a
moment
,
he
would
vanish
,
causing
the
gazer
to
blink
like
*NL*
Ashton
at
the
disappearance
of
Ravenswood
.
That
abstracted
pedestrian
*NL*
had
edged
into
the
slit
by
the
adroit
fillip
of
his
person
sideways
;
*NL*
from
the
slit
he
edged
into
the
tavern
by
a
similar
exercise
of
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
at
the
Three
Mariners
were
persons
of
quality
in
comparison
*NL*
with
the
company
which
gathered
here
;
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
*NL*
the
lowest
fringe
of
the
Mariner
's
party
touched
the
crest
of
Peter
's
at
*NL*
points
.
Waifs
and
strays
of
all
sorts
loitered
about
here
.
The
landlady
*NL*
was
a
virtuous
woman
who
years
ago
had
been
unjustly
sent
to
gaol
as
*NL*
an
accessory
to
something
or
other
after
the
fact
.
She
underwent
her
*NL*
twelvemonth
,
and
had
worn
a
martyr
's
countenance
ever
since
,
except
at
*NL*
times
of
meeting
the
constable
who
apprehended
her
,
when
she
winked
her
*NL*
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
house
Jopp
and
his
acquaintances
had
arrived
.
The
settles
on
*NL*
which
they
sat
down
were
thin
and
tall
,
their
tops
being
guyed
by
pieces
*NL*
of
twine
to
hooks
in
the
ceiling
;
for
when
the
guests
grew
boisterous
*NL*
the
settles
would
rock
and
overturn
without
some
such
security
.
The
*NL*
thunder
of
bowls
echoed
from
the
backyard
;
swingels
hung
behind
the
*NL*
blower
of
the
chimney
;
and
ex-poachers
and
ex-gamekeepers
,
whom
squires
*NL*
had
persecuted
without
a
cause
,
sat
elbowing
each
other
--
men
who
in
past
*NL*
times
had
met
in
fights
under
the
moon
,
till
lapse
of
sentences
on
the
*NL*
one
part
,
and
loss
of
favour
and
expulsion
from
service
on
the
other
,
*NL*
brought
them
here
together
to
a
common
level
,
where
they
sat
calmly
*NL*
discussing
old
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
mind
how
you
could
jerk
a
trout
ashore
with
a
bramble
,
and
not
*NL*
ruffle
the
stream
,
Charl
?
''
a
deposed
keeper
was
saying
.
''
'T
was
at
that
I
*NL*
caught
`
ee
once
,
if
you
can
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
.
But
the
worst
larry
for
me
was
that
pheasant
business
*NL*
at
Yalbury
Wood
.
Your
wife
swore
false
that
time
,
Joe
--
O
,
by
Gad
,
she
*NL*
did
--
there
's
no
denying
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
that
?
''
asked
Jopp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
Joe
closed
wi
'
me
,
and
we
rolled
down
together
,
close
to
his
*NL*
garden
hedge
.
Hearing
the
noise
,
out
ran
his
wife
with
the
oven
pyle
,
*NL*
and
it
being
dark
under
the
trees
she
could
n't
see
which
was
uppermost
.
*NL*
`
Where
beest
thee
,
Joe
,
under
or
top
?
'
she
screeched
.
`
O
--
under
,
by
*NL*
Gad
!
'
says
he
.
She
then
began
to
rap
down
upon
my
skull
,
back
,
and
ribs
*NL*
with
the
pyle
till
we
'd
roll
over
again
.
`
Where
beest
now
,
dear
Joe
,
*NL*
under
or
top
?
'
she
'd
scream
again
.
By
George
,
't
was
through
her
I
was
*NL*
took
!
And
then
when
we
got
up
in
hall
she
sware
that
the
cock
pheasant
*NL*
was
one
of
her
rearing
,
when
't
was
not
your
bird
at
all
,
Joe
;
't
was
*NL*
Squire
Brown
's
bird
--
that
's
whose
't
was
--
one
that
we
'd
picked
off
as
*NL*
we
passed
his
wood
,
an
hour
afore
.
It
did
hurt
my
feelings
to
be
so
*NL*
wronged
!
...
Ah
well
--
't
is
over
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
had
`
ee
days
afore
that
,
''
said
the
keeper
.
``
I
was
within
*NL*
a
few
yards
of
`
ee
dozens
of
times
,
with
a
sight
more
of
birds
than
that
*NL*
poor
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
't
is
not
our
greatest
doings
that
the
world
gets
wind
of
,
''
said
*NL*
the
furmity-woman
,
who
,
lately
settled
in
this
purlieu
,
sat
among
*NL*
the
rest
.
Having
travelled
a
great
deal
in
her
time
she
spoke
with
*NL*
cosmopolitan
largeness
of
idea
.
It
was
she
who
presently
asked
Jopp
what
*NL*
was
the
parcel
he
kept
so
snugly
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
therein
lies
a
grand
secret
,
''
said
Jopp
.
``
It
is
the
passion
of
*NL*
love
.
To
think
that
a
woman
should
love
one
man
so
well
,
and
hate
*NL*
another
so
unmercifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
the
object
of
your
meditation
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
that
stands
high
in
this
town
.
I
'd
like
to
shame
her
!
Upon
my
life
,
*NL*
`
twould
be
as
good
as
a
play
to
read
her
love-letters
,
the
proud
piece
*NL*
of
silk
and
wax-work
!
For
't
is
her
love-letters
that
I
've
got
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
letters
?
then
let
's
hear
'em
,
good
soul
,
''
said
Mother
Cuxsom
.
*NL*
``
Lord
,
do
ye
mind
,
Richard
,
what
fools
we
used
to
be
when
we
were
*NL*
younger
?
Getting
a
schoolboy
to
write
ours
for
us
;
and
giving
him
a
*NL*
penny
,
do
ye
mind
,
not
to
tell
other
folks
what
he
'd
put
inside
,
do
ye
*NL*
mind

''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Jopp
had
pushed
his
finger
under
the
seals
,
and
unfastened
*NL*
the
letters
,
tumbling
them
over
and
picking
up
one
here
and
there
at
*NL*
random
,
which
he
read
aloud
.
These
passages
soon
began
to
uncover
the
*NL*
secret
which
Lucetta
had
so
earnestly
hoped
to
keep
buried
,
though
the
*NL*
epistles
,
being
allusive
only
,
did
not
make
it
altogether
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Farfrae
wrote
that
!
''
said
Nance
Mockridge
.
''
'T
is
a
humbling
thing
*NL*
for
us
,
as
respectable
women
,
that
one
of
the
same
sex
could
do
it
.
And
*NL*
now
she
's
avowed
herself
to
another
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
for
her
,
''
said
the
aged
furmity-woman
.
``
Ah
,
I
saved
*NL*
her
from
a
real
bad
marriage

and
she
's
never
been
the
one

thank
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
what
a
good
foundation
for
a
skimmity-ride
,
''
said
Nance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cuxsom
,
reflecting
.
''
'T
is
as
good
a
ground
for
a
*NL*
skimmity-ride
as
ever
I
knowed
;
and
it
ought
not
to
be
wasted
.
The
last
*NL*
one
seen
in
Casterbridge
must
have
been
ten
years
ago
,
if
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
there
was
a
shrill
whistle
,
and
the
landlady
said
to
the
*NL*
man
who
had
been
called
Charl
,
''
'T
is
Jim
coming
in
.
Would
ye
go
and
let
*NL*
down
the
bridge
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
replying
Charl
and
his
comrade
Joe
rose
,
and
receiving
a
lantern
*NL*
from
her
went
out
at
the
back
door
and
down
the
garden-path
,
which
ended
*NL*
abruptly
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
already
mentioned
.
Beyond
the
stream
*NL*
was
the
open
moor
,
from
which
a
clammy
breeze
smote
upon
their
faces
*NL*
as
they
advanced
.
Taking
up
the
board
that
had
lain
in
readiness
one
*NL*
of
them
lowered
it
across
the
water
,
and
the
instant
its
further
end
*NL*
touched
the
ground
footsteps
entered
upon
it
,
and
there
appeared
from
*NL*
the
shade
a
stalwart
man
with
straps
round
his
knees
,
a
double-barrelled
*NL*
gun
under
his
arm
and
some
birds
slung
up
behind
him
.
They
asked
him
if
*NL*
he
had
had
much
luck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
''
he
said
indifferently
.
``
All
safe
inside
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Receiving
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
he
went
on
inwards
,
the
others
*NL*
withdrawing
the
bridge
and
beginning
to
retreat
in
his
rear
.
Before
,
*NL*
however
,
they
had
entered
the
house
a
cry
of
``
Ahoy
''
from
the
moor
led
*NL*
them
to
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cry
was
repeated
.
They
pushed
the
lantern
into
an
outhouse
,
and
went
*NL*
back
to
the
brink
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ahoy
--
is
this
the
way
to
Casterbridge
?
''
said
some
one
from
the
other
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
particular
,
''
said
Charl
.
``
There
's
a
river
afore
`
ee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
--
here
's
for
through
it
!
''
said
the
man
in
the
moor
.
``
I
've
*NL*
had
travelling
enough
for
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
minute
,
then
,
''
said
Charl
,
finding
that
the
man
was
no
enemy
.
*NL*
``
Joe
,
bring
the
plank
and
lantern
;
here
's
somebody
that
's
lost
his
*NL*
way

You
should
have
kept
along
the
turnpike
road
,
friend
,
and
not
have
*NL*
strook
across
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
--
as
I
see
now
.
But
I
saw
a
light
here
,
and
says
I
to
myself
,
*NL*
that
's
an
outlying
house
,
depend
o
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
plank
was
now
lowered
;
and
the
stranger
's
form
shaped
itself
*NL*
from
the
darkness
.
He
was
a
middle-aged
man
,
with
hair
and
whiskers
*NL*
prematurely
grey
,
and
a
broad
and
genial
face
.
He
had
crossed
on
the
*NL*
plank
without
hesitation
,
and
seemed
to
see
nothing
odd
in
the
transit
.
*NL*
He
thanked
them
,
and
walked
between
them
up
the
garden
.
``
What
place
is
*NL*
this
?
''
he
asked
,
when
they
reached
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
public-house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
perhaps
it
will
suit
me
to
put
up
at
.
Now
then
,
come
in
and
wet
*NL*
your
whistle
at
my
expense
for
the
lift
over
you
have
given
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
followed
him
into
the
inn
,
where
the
increased
light
exhibited
him
*NL*
as
one
who
would
stand
higher
in
an
estimate
by
the
eye
than
in
one
by
*NL*
the
ear
.
He
was
dressed
with
a
certain
clumsy
richness
--
his
coat
being
*NL*
furred
,
and
his
head
covered
by
a
cap
of
seal-skin
,
which
,
though
the
*NL*
nights
were
chilly
,
must
have
been
warm
for
the
daytime
,
spring
being
*NL*
somewhat
advanced
.
In
his
hand
he
carried
a
small
mahogany
case
,
*NL*
strapped
,
and
clamped
with
brass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apparently
surprised
at
the
kind
of
company
which
confronted
him
through
*NL*
the
kitchen
door
,
he
at
once
abandoned
his
idea
of
putting
up
at
the
*NL*
house
;
but
taking
the
situation
lightly
,
he
called
for
glasses
of
the
*NL*
best
,
paid
for
them
as
he
stood
in
the
passage
,
and
turned
to
proceed
on
*NL*
his
way
by
the
front
door
.
This
was
barred
,
and
while
the
landlady
was
*NL*
unfastening
it
the
conversation
about
the
skimmington
was
continued
in
*NL*
the
sitting-room
,
and
reached
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
they
mean
by
a
`
skimmity-ride
'
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
sir
!
''
said
the
landlady
,
swinging
her
long
earrings
with
deprecating
*NL*
modesty
;
''
't
is
a
'
old
foolish
thing
they
do
in
these
parts
when
a
*NL*
man
's
wife
is
--
well
,
not
too
particularly
his
own
.
But
as
a
respectable
*NL*
householder
I
do
n't
encourage
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
are
they
going
to
do
it
shortly
?
It
is
a
good
sight
to
see
,
I
*NL*
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
!
''
she
simpered
.
And
then
,
bursting
into
naturalness
,
and
*NL*
glancing
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
''
'T
is
the
funniest
thing
under
the
*NL*
sun
!
And
it
costs
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
remember
hearing
of
some
such
thing
.
Now
I
shall
be
in
*NL*
Casterbridge
for
two
or
three
weeks
to
come
,
and
should
not
mind
*NL*
seeing
the
performance
.
Wait
a
moment
.
''
He
turned
back
,
entered
the
*NL*
sitting-room
,
and
said
,
``
Here
,
good
folks
;
I
should
like
to
see
the
*NL*
old
custom
you
are
talking
of
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
being
something
towards
*NL*
it
--
take
that
.
''
He
threw
a
sovereign
on
the
table
and
returned
to
the
*NL*
landlady
at
the
door
,
of
whom
,
having
inquired
the
way
into
the
town
,
he
*NL*
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
more
where
that
one
came
from
,
''
said
Charl
when
the
*NL*
sovereign
had
been
taken
up
and
handed
to
the
landlady
for
safe
keeping
.
*NL*
``
By
George
!
we
ought
to
have
got
a
few
more
while
we
had
him
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
answered
the
landlady
.
``
This
is
a
respectable
house
,
thank
*NL*
God
!
And
I
'll
have
nothing
done
but
what
's
honourable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Jopp
;
``
now
we
'll
consider
the
business
begun
,
and
will
soon
*NL*
get
it
in
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
!
''
said
Nance
.
``
A
good
laugh
warms
my
heart
more
than
a
cordial
,
*NL*
and
that
's
the
truth
o
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
gathered
up
the
letters
,
and
it
being
now
somewhat
late
he
did
*NL*
not
attempt
to
call
at
Farfrae
's
with
them
that
night
.
He
reached
home
,
*NL*
sealed
them
up
as
before
,
and
delivered
the
parcel
at
its
address
next
*NL*
morning
.
Within
an
hour
its
contents
were
reduced
to
ashes
by
Lucetta
,
*NL*
who
,
poor
soul
!
was
inclined
to
fall
down
on
her
knees
in
thankfulness
*NL*
that
at
last
no
evidence
remained
of
the
unlucky
episode
with
Henchard
*NL*
in
her
past
.
For
though
hers
had
been
rather
the
laxity
of
inadvertence
*NL*
than
of
intention
,
that
episode
,
if
known
,
was
not
the
less
likely
to
*NL*
operate
fatally
between
herself
and
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
37
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
state
of
things
when
the
current
affairs
of
Casterbridge
*NL*
were
interrupted
by
an
event
of
such
magnitude
that
its
influence
*NL*
reached
to
the
lowest
social
stratum
there
,
stirring
the
depths
of
its
*NL*
society
simultaneously
with
the
preparations
for
the
skimmington
.
It
*NL*
was
one
of
those
excitements
which
,
when
they
move
a
country
town
,
leave
*NL*
permanent
mark
upon
its
chronicles
,
as
a
warm
summer
permanently
marks
*NL*
the
ring
in
the
tree-trunk
corresponding
to
its
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Royal
Personage
was
about
to
pass
through
the
borough
on
his
course
*NL*
further
west
,
to
inaugurate
an
immense
engineering
work
out
that
way
.
He
*NL*
had
consented
to
halt
half-an-hour
or
so
in
the
town
,
and
to
receive
an
*NL*
address
from
the
corporation
of
Casterbridge
,
which
,
as
a
representative
*NL*
centre
of
husbandry
,
wished
thus
to
express
its
sense
of
the
great
*NL*
services
he
had
rendered
to
agricultural
science
and
economics
,
by
his
*NL*
zealous
promotion
of
designs
for
placing
the
art
of
farming
on
a
more
*NL*
scientific
footing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Royalty
had
not
been
seen
in
Casterbridge
since
the
days
of
the
third
*NL*
King
George
,
and
then
only
by
candlelight
for
a
few
minutes
,
when
that
*NL*
monarch
,
on
a
night-journey
,
had
stopped
to
change
horses
at
the
*NL*
King
's
Arms
.
The
inhabitants
therefore
decided
to
make
a
thorough
fete
*NL*
carillonee
of
the
unwonted
occasion
.
Half-an-hour
's
pause
was
not
long
,
*NL*
it
is
true
;
but
much
might
be
done
in
it
by
a
judicious
grouping
of
*NL*
incidents
,
above
all
,
if
the
weather
were
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
address
was
prepared
on
parchment
by
an
artist
who
was
handy
at
*NL*
ornamental
lettering
,
and
was
laid
on
with
the
best
gold-leaf
and
*NL*
colours
that
the
sign-painter
had
in
his
shop
.
The
Council
had
met
on
*NL*
the
Tuesday
before
the
appointed
day
,
to
arrange
the
details
of
the
*NL*
procedure
.
While
they
were
sitting
,
the
door
of
the
Council
Chamber
*NL*
standing
open
,
they
heard
a
heavy
footstep
coming
up
the
stairs
.
It
*NL*
advanced
along
the
passage
,
and
Henchard
entered
the
room
,
in
clothes
of
*NL*
frayed
and
threadbare
shabbiness
,
the
very
clothes
which
he
had
used
to
*NL*
wear
in
the
primal
days
when
he
had
sat
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
feeling
,
''
he
said
,
advancing
to
the
table
and
laying
his
hand
*NL*
upon
the
green
cloth
,
``
that
I
should
like
to
join
ye
in
this
reception
*NL*
of
our
illustrious
visitor
.
I
suppose
I
could
walk
with
the
rest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Embarrassed
glances
were
exchanged
by
the
Council
and
Grower
nearly
*NL*
ate
the
end
of
his
quill-pen
off
,
so
gnawed
he
it
during
the
silence
.
*NL*
Farfrae
the
young
Mayor
,
who
by
virtue
of
his
office
sat
in
the
large
*NL*
chair
,
intuitively
caught
the
sense
of
the
meeting
,
and
as
spokesman
*NL*
was
obliged
to
utter
it
,
glad
as
he
would
have
been
that
the
duty
should
*NL*
have
fallen
to
another
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
see
that
it
would
be
proper
,
Mr.
Henchard
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
*NL*
Council
are
the
Council
,
and
as
ye
are
no
longer
one
of
the
body
,
there
*NL*
would
be
an
irregularity
in
the
proceeding
.
If
ye
were
included
,
why
not
*NL*
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
assist
at
the
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
looked
round
.
``
I
think
I
have
expressed
the
feeling
of
the
*NL*
Council
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
from
Dr.
Bath
,
Lawyer
Long
,
Alderman
Tubber
,
and
several
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
am
not
to
be
allowed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
officially
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
so
;
it
is
out
of
the
question
,
indeed
.
But
of
course
you
*NL*
can
see
the
doings
full
well
,
such
as
they
are
to
be
,
like
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
spectators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
did
not
reply
to
that
very
obvious
suggestion
,
and
,
turning
on
*NL*
his
heel
,
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
only
a
passing
fancy
of
his
,
but
opposition
crystallized
*NL*
it
into
a
determination
.
``
I
'll
welcome
his
Royal
Highness
,
or
nobody
*NL*
shall
!
''
he
went
about
saying
.
``
I
am
not
going
to
be
sat
upon
by
Farfrae
,
*NL*
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
paltry
crew
!
You
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eventful
morning
was
bright
,
a
full-faced
sun
confronting
early
*NL*
window-gazers
eastward
,
and
all
perceived
-LRB-
for
they
were
practised
in
*NL*
weather-lore
-RRB-
that
there
was
permanence
in
the
glow
.
Visitors
soon
began
*NL*
to
flock
in
from
county
houses
,
villages
,
remote
copses
,
and
lonely
*NL*
uplands
,
the
latter
in
oiled
boots
and
tilt
bonnets
,
to
see
the
*NL*
reception
,
or
if
not
to
see
it
,
at
any
rate
to
be
near
it
.
There
was
*NL*
hardly
a
workman
in
the
town
who
did
not
put
a
clean
shirt
on
.
Solomon
*NL*
Longways
,
Christopher
Coney
,
Buzzford
,
and
the
rest
of
that
fraternity
,
*NL*
showed
their
sense
of
the
occasion
by
advancing
their
customary
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
pint
to
half-past
ten
;
from
which
they
found
a
difficulty
in
*NL*
getting
back
to
the
proper
hour
for
several
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
had
determined
to
do
no
work
that
day
.
He
primed
himself
in
*NL*
the
morning
with
a
glass
of
rum
,
and
walking
down
the
street
met
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
,
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
a
week
.
``
It
was
lucky
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
her
,
``
my
twenty-one
years
had
expired
before
this
came
on
,
or
I
*NL*
should
never
have
had
the
nerve
to
carry
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carry
out
what
?
''
said
she
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
welcome
I
am
going
to
give
our
Royal
visitor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
perplexed
.
``
Shall
we
go
and
see
it
together
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
it
!
I
have
other
fish
to
fry
.
You
see
it
.
It
will
be
worth
seeing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
do
nothing
to
elucidate
this
,
and
decked
herself
out
with
a
*NL*
heavy
heart
.
As
the
appointed
time
drew
near
she
got
sight
again
of
her
*NL*
stepfather
.
She
thought
he
was
going
to
the
Three
Mariners
;
but
no
,
*NL*
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
gay
throng
to
the
shop
of
Woolfrey
,
the
*NL*
draper
.
She
waited
in
the
crowd
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
he
emerged
,
wearing
,
to
her
surprise
,
a
brilliant
*NL*
rosette
,
while
more
surprising
still
,
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
flag
of
*NL*
somewhat
homely
construction
,
formed
by
tacking
one
of
the
small
*NL*
Union
Jacks
,
which
abounded
in
the
town
to-day
,
to
the
end
of
a
deal
*NL*
wand
--
probably
the
roller
from
a
piece
of
calico
.
Henchard
rolled
up
his
*NL*
flag
on
the
doorstep
,
put
it
under
his
arm
,
and
went
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
taller
members
of
the
crowd
turned
their
heads
,
and
the
*NL*
shorter
stood
on
tiptoe
.
It
was
said
that
the
Royal
cortege
approached
.
*NL*
The
railway
had
stretched
out
an
arm
towards
Casterbridge
at
this
time
,
*NL*
but
had
not
reached
it
by
several
miles
as
yet
;
so
that
the
intervening
*NL*
distance
,
as
well
as
the
remainder
of
the
journey
,
was
to
be
traversed
*NL*
by
road
in
the
old
fashion
.
People
thus
waited
--
the
county
families
*NL*
in
their
carriages
,
the
masses
on
foot
--
and
watched
the
far-stretching
*NL*
London
highway
to
the
ringing
of
bells
and
chatter
of
tongues
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
background
Elizabeth-Jane
watched
the
scene
.
Some
seats
had
*NL*
been
arranged
from
which
ladies
could
witness
the
spectacle
,
and
the
*NL*
front
seat
was
occupied
by
Lucetta
,
the
Mayor
's
wife
,
just
at
present
.
*NL*
In
the
road
under
her
eyes
stood
Henchard
.
She
appeared
so
bright
and
*NL*
pretty
that
,
as
it
seemed
,
he
was
experiencing
the
momentary
weakness
of
*NL*
wishing
for
her
notice
.
But
he
was
far
from
attractive
to
a
woman
's
eye
,
*NL*
ruled
as
that
is
so
largely
by
the
superficies
of
things
.
He
was
not
*NL*
only
a
journeyman
,
unable
to
appear
as
he
formerly
had
appeared
,
but
he
*NL*
disdained
to
appear
as
well
as
he
might
.
Everybody
else
,
from
the
*NL*
Mayor
to
the
washerwoman
,
shone
in
new
vesture
according
to
means
;
but
*NL*
Henchard
had
doggedly
retained
the
fretted
and
weather-beaten
garments
*NL*
of
bygone
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
alas
,
this
occurred
:
Lucetta
's
eyes
slid
over
him
to
this
side
*NL*
and
to
that
without
anchoring
on
his
features
--
as
gaily
dressed
women
's
*NL*
eyes
will
too
often
do
on
such
occasions
.
Her
manner
signified
quite
*NL*
plainly
that
she
meant
to
know
him
in
public
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
never
tired
of
watching
Donald
,
as
he
stood
in
animated
*NL*
converse
with
his
friends
a
few
yards
off
,
wearing
round
his
young
neck
*NL*
the
official
gold
chain
with
great
square
links
,
like
that
round
the
*NL*
Royal
unicorn
.
Every
trifling
emotion
that
her
husband
showed
as
he
*NL*
talked
had
its
reflex
on
her
face
and
lips
,
which
moved
in
little
*NL*
duplicates
to
his
.
She
was
living
his
part
rather
than
her
own
,
and
*NL*
cared
for
no
one
's
situation
but
Farfrae
's
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
a
man
stationed
at
the
furthest
turn
of
the
high
road
,
namely
,
*NL*
on
the
second
bridge
of
which
mention
has
been
made
,
gave
a
signal
,
and
*NL*
the
Corporation
in
their
robes
proceeded
from
the
front
of
the
Town
*NL*
Hall
to
the
archway
erected
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
.
The
carriages
*NL*
containing
the
Royal
visitor
and
his
suite
arrived
at
the
spot
in
a
*NL*
cloud
of
dust
,
a
procession
was
formed
,
and
the
whole
came
on
to
the
*NL*
Town
Hall
at
a
walking
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spot
was
the
centre
of
interest
.
There
were
a
few
clear
yards
in
*NL*
front
of
the
Royal
carriage
,
sanded
;
and
into
this
space
a
man
stepped
*NL*
before
any
one
could
prevent
him
.
It
was
Henchard
.
He
had
unrolled
*NL*
his
private
flag
,
and
removing
his
hat
he
staggered
to
the
side
of
the
*NL*
slowing
vehicle
,
waving
the
Union
Jack
to
and
fro
with
his
left
hand
*NL*
while
he
blandly
held
out
his
right
to
the
Illustrious
Personage
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
ladies
said
with
bated
breath
,
``
O
,
look
there
!
''
and
Lucetta
was
*NL*
ready
to
faint
.
Elizabeth-Jane
peeped
through
the
shoulders
of
those
in
*NL*
front
,
saw
what
it
was
,
and
was
terrified
;
and
then
her
interest
in
the
*NL*
spectacle
as
a
strange
phenomenon
got
the
better
of
her
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
,
with
Mayoral
authority
,
immediately
rose
to
the
occasion
.
He
*NL*
seized
Henchard
by
the
shoulder
,
dragged
him
back
,
and
told
him
roughly
*NL*
to
be
off
.
Henchard
's
eyes
met
his
,
and
Farfrae
observed
the
fierce
*NL*
light
in
them
despite
his
excitement
and
irritation
.
For
a
moment
*NL*
Henchard
stood
his
ground
rigidly
;
then
by
an
unaccountable
impulse
gave
*NL*
way
and
retired
.
Farfrae
glanced
to
the
ladies
'
gallery
,
and
saw
that
*NL*
his
Calphurnia
's
cheek
was
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
it
is
your
husband
's
old
patron
!
''
said
Mrs.
Blowbody
,
a
lady
of
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
who
sat
beside
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patron
!
''
said
Donald
's
wife
with
quick
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
the
man
is
an
acquaintance
of
Mr.
Farfrae
's
?
''
observed
Mrs.
*NL*
Bath
,
the
physician
's
wife
,
a
new-comer
to
the
town
through
her
recent
*NL*
marriage
with
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
works
for
my
husband
,
''
said
Lucetta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
is
that
all
?
They
have
been
saying
to
me
that
it
was
through
him
*NL*
your
husband
first
got
a
footing
in
Casterbridge
.
What
stories
people
*NL*
will
tell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
indeed
.
It
was
not
so
at
all
.
Donald
's
genius
would
have
*NL*
enabled
him
to
get
a
footing
anywhere
,
without
anybody
's
help
!
He
would
*NL*
have
been
just
the
same
if
there
had
been
no
Henchard
in
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
partly
Lucetta
's
ignorance
of
the
circumstances
of
Donald
's
*NL*
arrival
which
led
her
to
speak
thus
,
partly
the
sensation
that
everybody
*NL*
seemed
bent
on
snubbing
her
at
this
triumphant
time
.
The
incident
had
*NL*
occupied
but
a
few
moments
,
but
it
was
necessarily
witnessed
by
the
*NL*
Royal
Personage
,
who
,
however
,
with
practised
tact
affected
not
to
have
*NL*
noticed
anything
unusual
.
He
alighted
,
the
Mayor
advanced
,
the
address
*NL*
was
read
;
the
Illustrious
Personage
replied
,
then
said
a
few
words
to
*NL*
Farfrae
,
and
shook
hands
with
Lucetta
as
the
Mayor
's
wife
.
The
ceremony
*NL*
occupied
but
a
few
minutes
,
and
the
carriages
rattled
heavily
as
*NL*
Pharaoh
's
chariots
down
Corn
Street
and
out
upon
the
Budmouth
Road
,
in
*NL*
continuation
of
the
journey
coastward
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
crowd
stood
Coney
,
Buzzford
,
and
Longways
``
Some
difference
*NL*
between
him
now
and
when
he
zung
at
the
Dree
Mariners
,
''
said
the
first
.
*NL*
''
'T
is
wonderful
how
he
could
get
a
lady
of
her
quality
to
go
snacks
wi
'
*NL*
en
in
such
quick
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
Yet
how
folk
do
worship
fine
clothes
!
Now
there
's
a
*NL*
better-looking
woman
than
she
that
nobody
notices
at
all
,
because
she
's
*NL*
akin
to
that
hontish
fellow
Henchard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
worship
ye
,
Buzz
,
for
saying
that
,
''
remarked
Nance
Mockridge
.
*NL*
``
I
do
like
to
see
the
trimming
pulled
off
such
Christmas
candles
.
I
am
*NL*
quite
unequal
to
the
part
of
villain
myself
,
or
I
'd
gi'e
all
my
small
*NL*
silver
to
see
that
lady
toppered
...
And
perhaps
I
shall
soon
,
''
she
added
*NL*
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
a
noble
passiont
for
a
`
oman
to
keep
up
,
''
said
Longways
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nance
did
not
reply
,
but
every
one
knew
what
she
meant
.
The
ideas
*NL*
diffused
by
the
reading
of
Lucetta
's
letters
at
Peter
's
Finger
had
*NL*
condensed
into
a
scandal
,
which
was
spreading
like
a
miasmatic
fog
*NL*
through
Mixen
Lane
,
and
thence
up
the
back
streets
of
Casterbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mixed
assemblage
of
idlers
known
to
each
other
presently
fell
apart
*NL*
into
two
bands
by
a
process
of
natural
selection
,
the
frequenters
of
*NL*
Peter
's
Finger
going
off
Mixen
Lanewards
,
where
most
of
them
lived
,
*NL*
while
Coney
,
Buzzford
,
Longways
,
and
that
connection
remained
in
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
's
brewing
down
there
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Buzzford
*NL*
mysteriously
to
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coney
looked
at
him
.
``
Not
the
skimmity-ride
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buzzford
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my
doubts
if
it
will
be
carried
out
,
''
said
Longways
.
``
If
they
*NL*
are
getting
it
up
they
are
keeping
it
mighty
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
they
were
thinking
of
it
a
fortnight
ago
,
at
all
events
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
sure
o
'
t
I
'd
lay
information
,
''
said
Longways
emphatically
.
*NL*
''
'T
is
too
rough
a
joke
,
and
apt
to
wake
riots
in
towns
.
We
know
that
*NL*
the
Scotchman
is
a
right
enough
man
,
and
that
his
lady
has
been
a
right
*NL*
enough
`
oman
since
she
came
here
,
and
if
there
was
anything
wrong
about
*NL*
her
afore
,
that
's
their
business
,
not
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Coney
reflected
.
Farfrae
was
still
liked
in
the
community
;
but
it
must
*NL*
be
owned
that
,
as
the
Mayor
and
man
of
money
,
engrossed
with
affairs
and
*NL*
ambitions
,
he
had
lost
in
the
eyes
of
the
poorer
inhabitants
something
*NL*
of
that
wondrous
charm
which
he
had
had
for
them
as
a
light-hearted
*NL*
penniless
young
man
,
who
sang
ditties
as
readily
as
the
birds
in
the
*NL*
trees
.
Hence
the
anxiety
to
keep
him
from
annoyance
showed
not
quite
the
*NL*
ardour
that
would
have
animated
it
in
former
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
we
make
inquiration
into
it
,
Christopher
,
''
continued
Longways
;
*NL*
``
and
if
we
find
there
's
really
anything
in
it
,
drop
a
letter
to
them
*NL*
most
concerned
,
and
advise
'em
to
keep
out
of
the
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
course
was
decided
on
,
and
the
group
separated
,
Buzzford
saying
to
*NL*
Coney
,
``
Come
,
my
ancient
friend
;
let
's
move
on
.
There
's
nothing
more
to
*NL*
see
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
well-intentioned
ones
would
have
been
surprised
had
they
known
how
*NL*
ripe
the
great
jocular
plot
really
was
.
``
Yes
,
to-night
,
''
Jopp
had
said
*NL*
to
the
Peter
's
party
at
the
corner
of
Mixen
Lane
.
``
As
a
wind-up
to
the
*NL*
Royal
visit
the
hit
will
be
all
the
more
pat
by
reason
of
their
great
*NL*
elevation
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
him
,
at
least
,
it
was
not
a
joke
,
but
a
retaliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
38
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
proceedings
had
been
brief
--
too
brief
--
to
Lucetta
whom
an
*NL*
intoxicating
Weltlust
had
fairly
mastered
;
but
they
had
brought
her
a
*NL*
great
triumph
nevertheless
.
The
shake
of
the
Royal
hand
still
lingered
*NL*
in
her
fingers
;
and
the
chit-chat
she
had
overheard
,
that
her
husband
*NL*
might
possibly
receive
the
honour
of
knighthood
,
though
idle
to
a
*NL*
degree
,
seemed
not
the
wildest
vision
;
stranger
things
had
occurred
to
*NL*
men
so
good
and
captivating
as
her
Scotchman
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
collision
with
the
Mayor
,
Henchard
had
withdrawn
behind
the
*NL*
ladies
'
stand
;
and
there
he
stood
,
regarding
with
a
stare
of
abstraction
*NL*
the
spot
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
where
Farfrae
's
hand
had
seized
it
.
*NL*
He
put
his
own
hand
there
,
as
if
he
could
hardly
realize
such
an
outrage
*NL*
from
one
whom
it
had
once
been
his
wont
to
treat
with
ardent
generosity
.
*NL*
While
pausing
in
this
half-stupefied
state
the
conversation
of
Lucetta
*NL*
with
the
other
ladies
reached
his
ears
;
and
he
distinctly
heard
her
deny
*NL*
him
--
deny
that
he
had
assisted
Donald
,
that
he
was
anything
more
than
a
*NL*
common
journeyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
on
homeward
,
and
met
Jopp
in
the
archway
to
the
Bull
Stake
.
``
So
*NL*
you
've
had
a
snub
,
''
said
Jopp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
I
have
?
''
answered
Henchard
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
've
had
one
too
,
so
we
are
both
under
the
same
cold
shade
.
''
He
*NL*
briefly
related
his
attempt
to
win
Lucetta
's
intercession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
merely
heard
his
story
,
without
taking
it
deeply
in
.
His
own
*NL*
relation
to
Farfrae
and
Lucetta
overshadowed
all
kindred
ones
.
He
went
*NL*
on
saying
brokenly
to
himself
,
``
She
has
supplicated
to
me
in
her
time
;
*NL*
and
now
her
tongue
wo
n't
own
me
nor
her
eyes
see
me
!
...
And
he
--
how
angry
*NL*
he
looked
.
He
drove
me
back
as
if
I
were
a
bull
breaking
fence
...
I
*NL*
took
it
like
a
lamb
,
for
I
saw
it
could
not
be
settled
there
.
He
can
*NL*
rub
brine
on
a
green
wound
!
...
But
he
shall
pay
for
it
,
and
she
shall
be
*NL*
sorry
.
It
must
come
to
a
tussle
--
face
to
face
;
and
then
we
'll
see
how
a
*NL*
coxcomb
can
front
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
further
reflection
the
fallen
merchant
,
bent
on
some
wild
*NL*
purpose
,
ate
a
hasty
dinner
and
went
forth
to
find
Farfrae
.
After
being
*NL*
injured
by
him
as
a
rival
,
and
snubbed
by
him
as
a
journeyman
,
the
*NL*
crowning
degradation
had
been
reserved
for
this
day
--
that
he
should
be
*NL*
shaken
at
the
collar
by
him
as
a
vagabond
in
the
face
of
the
whole
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowds
had
dispersed
.
But
for
the
green
arches
which
still
stood
*NL*
as
they
were
erected
Casterbridge
life
had
resumed
its
ordinary
shape
.
*NL*
Henchard
went
down
Corn
Street
till
he
came
to
Farfrae
's
house
,
where
he
*NL*
knocked
,
and
left
a
message
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
his
employer
at
*NL*
the
granaries
as
soon
as
he
conveniently
could
come
there
.
Having
done
*NL*
this
he
proceeded
round
to
the
back
and
entered
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
was
present
,
for
,
as
he
had
been
aware
,
the
labourers
and
*NL*
carters
were
enjoying
a
half-holiday
on
account
of
the
events
of
the
*NL*
morning
--
though
the
carters
would
have
to
return
for
a
short
time
later
*NL*
on
,
to
feed
and
litter
down
the
horses
.
He
had
reached
the
granary
steps
*NL*
and
was
about
to
ascend
,
when
he
said
to
himself
aloud
,
``
I
'm
stronger
*NL*
than
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
returned
to
a
shed
,
where
he
selected
a
short
piece
of
rope
*NL*
from
several
pieces
that
were
lying
about
;
hitching
one
end
of
this
to
*NL*
a
nail
,
he
took
the
other
in
his
right
hand
and
turned
himself
bodily
*NL*
round
,
while
keeping
his
arm
against
his
side
;
by
this
contrivance
he
*NL*
pinioned
the
arm
effectively
.
He
now
went
up
the
ladders
to
the
top
*NL*
floor
of
the
corn-stores
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
empty
except
of
a
few
sacks
,
and
at
the
further
end
was
the
door
*NL*
often
mentioned
,
opening
under
the
cathead
and
chain
that
hoisted
the
*NL*
sacks
.
He
fixed
the
door
open
and
looked
over
the
sill
.
There
was
a
*NL*
depth
of
thirty
or
forty
feet
to
the
ground
;
here
was
the
spot
on
which
*NL*
he
had
been
standing
with
Farfrae
when
Elizabeth-Jane
had
seen
him
lift
*NL*
his
arm
,
with
many
misgivings
as
to
what
the
movement
portended
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
retired
a
few
steps
into
the
loft
and
waited
.
From
this
elevated
*NL*
perch
his
eyes
could
sweep
the
roofs
round
about
,
the
upper
parts
of
the
*NL*
luxurious
chestnut
trees
,
now
delicate
in
leaves
of
a
week
's
age
,
and
*NL*
the
drooping
boughs
of
the
lines
;
Farfrae
's
garden
and
the
green
door
*NL*
leading
therefrom
.
In
course
of
time
--
he
could
not
say
how
long
--
that
*NL*
green
door
opened
and
Farfrae
came
through
.
He
was
dressed
as
if
for
a
*NL*
journey
.
The
low
light
of
the
nearing
evening
caught
his
head
and
*NL*
face
when
he
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
,
warming
them
to
a
*NL*
complexion
of
flame-colour
.
Henchard
watched
him
with
his
mouth
firmly
*NL*
set
,
the
squareness
of
his
jaw
and
the
verticality
of
his
profile
being
*NL*
unduly
marked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
came
on
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
humming
a
tune
in
a
way
*NL*
which
told
that
the
words
were
most
in
his
mind
.
They
were
those
of
the
*NL*
song
he
had
sung
when
he
arrived
years
before
at
the
Three
Mariners
,
a
*NL*
poor
young
man
,
adventuring
for
life
and
fortune
,
and
scarcely
knowing
*NL*
witherward
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
's
a
hand
,
my
trusty
fiere
,
*NL*
And
gie
's
a
hand
o
'
thine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
moved
Henchard
like
an
old
melody
.
He
sank
back
.
``
No
;
I
ca
n't
do
*NL*
it
!
''
he
gasped
.
``
Why
does
the
infernal
fool
begin
that
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Farfrae
was
silent
,
and
Henchard
looked
out
of
the
loft
door
.
*NL*
``
Will
ye
come
up
here
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
man
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
I
could
n't
see
ye
.
What
's
wrang
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
Henchard
heard
his
feet
on
the
lowest
ladder
.
He
heard
*NL*
him
land
on
the
first
floor
,
ascend
and
land
on
the
second
,
begin
the
*NL*
ascent
to
the
third
.
And
then
his
head
rose
through
the
trap
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
up
here
at
this
time
?
''
he
asked
,
coming
forward
.
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
ye
take
your
holiday
like
the
rest
of
the
men
?
''
He
spoke
in
*NL*
a
tone
which
had
just
severity
enough
in
it
to
show
that
he
remembered
*NL*
the
untoward
event
of
the
forenoon
,
and
his
conviction
that
Henchard
had
*NL*
been
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
said
nothing
;
but
going
back
he
closed
the
stair
hatchway
,
and
*NL*
stamped
upon
it
so
that
it
went
tight
into
its
frame
;
he
next
turned
*NL*
to
the
wondering
young
man
,
who
by
this
time
observed
that
one
of
*NL*
Henchard
's
arms
was
bound
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Henchard
quietly
,
``
we
stand
face
to
face
--
man
and
man
.
Your
*NL*
money
and
your
fine
wife
no
longer
lift
`
ee
above
me
as
they
did
but
*NL*
now
,
and
my
poverty
does
not
press
me
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
all
mean
?
''
asked
Farfrae
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
my
lad
.
You
should
ha
'
thought
twice
before
you
affronted
*NL*
to
extremes
a
man
who
had
nothing
to
lose
.
I
've
stood
your
rivalry
,
*NL*
which
ruined
me
,
and
your
snubbing
,
which
humbled
me
;
but
your
hustling
,
*NL*
that
disgraced
me
,
I
wo
n't
stand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
warmed
a
little
at
this
.
``
Ye
'd
no
business
there
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
much
as
any
one
among
ye
!
What
,
you
forward
stripling
,
tell
a
man
of
*NL*
my
age
he
'd
no
business
there
!
''
The
anger-vein
swelled
in
his
forehead
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
insulted
Royalty
,
Henchard
;
and
't
was
my
duty
,
as
the
chief
*NL*
magistrate
,
to
stop
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Royalty
be
damned
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
I
am
as
loyal
as
you
,
come
to
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
here
to
argue
.
Wait
till
you
cool
doon
,
wait
till
you
cool
;
*NL*
and
you
will
see
things
the
same
way
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
the
one
to
cool
first
,
''
said
Henchard
grimly
.
``
Now
this
*NL*
is
the
case
.
Here
be
we
,
in
this
four-square
loft
,
to
finish
out
that
*NL*
little
wrestle
you
began
this
morning
.
There
's
the
door
,
forty
foot
*NL*
above
ground
.
One
of
us
two
puts
the
other
out
by
that
door
--
the
master
*NL*
stays
inside
.
If
he
likes
he
may
go
down
afterwards
and
give
the
*NL*
alarm
that
the
other
has
fallen
out
by
accident
--
or
he
may
tell
the
*NL*
truth
--
that
's
his
business
.
As
the
strongest
man
I
've
tied
one
arm
to
*NL*
take
no
advantage
of
`
ee
.
D'ye
understand
?
Then
here
's
at
`
ee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
time
for
Farfrae
to
do
aught
but
one
thing
,
to
close
with
*NL*
Henchard
,
for
the
latter
had
come
on
at
once
.
It
was
a
wrestling
match
,
*NL*
the
object
of
each
being
to
give
his
antagonist
a
back
fall
;
and
on
*NL*
Henchard
's
part
,
unquestionably
,
that
it
should
be
through
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
outset
Henchard
's
hold
by
his
only
free
hand
,
the
right
,
was
on
*NL*
the
left
side
of
Farfrae
's
collar
,
which
he
firmly
grappled
,
the
latter
*NL*
holding
Henchard
by
his
collar
with
the
contrary
hand
.
With
his
right
he
*NL*
endeavoured
to
get
hold
of
his
antagonist
's
left
arm
,
which
,
however
,
he
*NL*
could
not
do
,
so
adroitly
did
Henchard
keep
it
in
the
rear
as
he
gazed
*NL*
upon
the
lowered
eyes
of
his
fair
and
slim
antagonist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
planted
the
first
toe
forward
,
Farfrae
crossing
him
with
his
;
*NL*
and
thus
far
the
struggle
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
the
ordinary
*NL*
wrestling
of
those
parts
.
Several
minutes
were
passed
by
them
in
this
*NL*
attitude
,
the
pair
rocking
and
writhing
like
trees
in
a
gale
,
both
*NL*
preserving
an
absolute
silence
.
By
this
time
their
breathing
could
be
*NL*
heard
.
Then
Farfrae
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
other
side
of
Henchard
's
*NL*
collar
,
which
was
resisted
by
the
larger
man
exerting
all
his
force
in
*NL*
a
wrenching
movement
,
and
this
part
of
the
struggle
ended
by
his
forcing
*NL*
Farfrae
down
on
his
knees
by
sheer
pressure
of
one
of
his
muscular
arms
.
*NL*
Hampered
as
he
was
,
however
,
he
could
not
keep
him
there
,
and
Farfrae
*NL*
finding
his
feet
again
the
struggle
proceeded
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
whirl
Henchard
brought
Donald
dangerously
near
the
precipice
;
*NL*
seeing
his
position
the
Scotchman
for
the
first
time
locked
himself
*NL*
to
his
adversary
,
and
all
the
efforts
of
that
infuriated
Prince
*NL*
of
Darkness
--
as
he
might
have
been
called
from
his
appearance
just
*NL*
now
--
were
inadequate
to
lift
or
loosen
Farfrae
for
a
time
.
By
an
*NL*
extraordinary
effort
he
succeeded
at
last
,
though
not
until
they
had
got
*NL*
far
back
again
from
the
fatal
door
.
In
doing
so
Henchard
contrived
to
*NL*
turn
Farfrae
a
complete
somersault
.
Had
Henchard
's
other
arm
been
free
*NL*
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
Farfrae
then
.
But
again
he
regained
his
*NL*
feet
,
wrenching
Henchard
's
arm
considerably
,
and
causing
him
sharp
pain
,
*NL*
as
could
be
seen
from
the
twitching
of
his
face
.
He
instantly
delivered
*NL*
the
younger
man
an
annihilating
turn
by
the
left
fore-hip
,
as
it
used
*NL*
to
be
expressed
,
and
following
up
his
advantage
thrust
him
towards
the
*NL*
door
,
never
loosening
his
hold
till
Farfrae
's
fair
head
was
hanging
over
*NL*
the
window-sill
,
and
his
arm
dangling
down
outside
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Henchard
between
his
gasps
,
``
this
is
the
end
of
what
you
*NL*
began
this
morning
.
Your
life
is
in
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
take
it
,
take
it
!
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
Ye
've
wished
to
long
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
looked
down
upon
him
in
silence
,
and
their
eyes
met
.
``
O
*NL*
Farfrae
!
--
that
's
not
true
!
''
he
said
bitterly
.
``
God
is
my
witness
that
*NL*
no
man
ever
loved
another
as
I
did
thee
at
one
time
...
And
now
--
though
I
*NL*
came
here
to
kill
`
ee
,
I
can
not
hurt
thee
!
Go
and
give
me
in
charge
--
do
*NL*
what
you
will
--
I
care
nothing
for
what
comes
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
withdrew
to
the
back
part
of
the
loft
,
loosened
his
arm
,
and
flung
*NL*
himself
in
a
corner
upon
some
sacks
,
in
the
abandonment
of
remorse
.
*NL*
Farfrae
regarded
him
in
silence
;
then
went
to
the
hatch
and
descended
*NL*
through
it
.
Henchard
would
fain
have
recalled
him
,
but
his
tongue
failed
*NL*
in
its
task
,
and
the
young
man
's
steps
died
on
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
took
his
full
measure
of
shame
and
self-reproach
.
The
scenes
of
*NL*
his
first
acquaintance
with
Farfrae
rushed
back
upon
him
--
that
time
when
*NL*
the
curious
mixture
of
romance
and
thrift
in
the
young
man
's
composition
*NL*
so
commanded
his
heart
that
Farfrae
could
play
upon
him
as
on
an
*NL*
instrument
.
So
thoroughly
subdued
was
he
that
he
remained
on
the
sacks
*NL*
in
a
crouching
attitude
,
unusual
for
a
man
,
and
for
such
a
man
.
*NL*
Its
womanliness
sat
tragically
on
the
figure
of
so
stern
a
piece
of
*NL*
virility
.
He
heard
a
conversation
below
,
the
opening
of
the
coach-house
*NL*
door
,
and
the
putting
in
of
a
horse
,
but
took
no
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
stayed
till
the
thin
shades
thickened
to
opaque
obscurity
,
and
*NL*
the
loft-door
became
an
oblong
of
gray
light
--
the
only
visible
shape
*NL*
around
.
At
length
he
arose
,
shook
the
dust
from
his
clothes
wearily
,
*NL*
felt
his
way
to
the
hatch
,
and
gropingly
descended
the
steps
till
he
*NL*
stood
in
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thought
highly
of
me
once
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
Now
he
'll
hate
me
and
*NL*
despise
me
for
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
possessed
by
an
overpowering
wish
to
see
Farfrae
again
*NL*
that
night
,
and
by
some
desperate
pleading
to
attempt
the
well-nigh
*NL*
impossible
task
of
winning
pardon
for
his
late
mad
attack
.
But
as
he
*NL*
walked
towards
Farfrae
's
door
he
recalled
the
unheeded
doings
in
the
*NL*
yard
while
he
had
lain
above
in
a
sort
of
stupor
.
Farfrae
he
remembered
*NL*
had
gone
to
the
stable
and
put
the
horse
into
the
gig
;
while
doing
so
*NL*
Whittle
had
brought
him
a
letter
;
Farfrae
had
then
said
that
he
would
*NL*
not
go
towards
Budmouth
as
he
had
intended
--
that
he
was
unexpectedly
*NL*
summoned
to
Weatherbury
,
and
meant
to
call
at
Mellstock
on
his
way
*NL*
thither
,
that
place
lying
but
one
or
two
miles
out
of
his
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
must
have
come
prepared
for
a
journey
when
he
first
arrived
in
the
*NL*
yard
,
unsuspecting
enmity
;
and
he
must
have
driven
off
-LRB-
though
in
a
*NL*
changed
direction
-RRB-
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
on
what
had
occurred
*NL*
between
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
therefore
be
useless
to
call
at
Farfrae
's
house
till
very
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
wait
till
his
return
,
though
waiting
was
*NL*
almost
torture
to
his
restless
and
self-accusing
soul
.
He
walked
about
*NL*
the
streets
and
outskirts
of
the
town
,
lingering
here
and
there
till
he
*NL*
reached
the
stone
bridge
of
which
mention
has
been
made
,
an
accustomed
*NL*
halting-place
with
him
now
.
Here
he
spent
a
long
time
,
the
purl
of
*NL*
waters
through
the
weirs
meeting
his
ear
,
and
the
Casterbridge
lights
*NL*
glimmering
at
no
great
distance
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
leaning
thus
upon
the
parapet
his
listless
attention
was
awakened
*NL*
by
sounds
of
an
unaccustomed
kind
from
the
town
quarter
.
They
were
a
*NL*
confusion
of
rhythmical
noises
,
to
which
the
streets
added
yet
more
*NL*
confusion
by
encumbering
them
with
echoes
.
His
first
incurious
thought
*NL*
that
the
clangour
arose
from
the
town
band
,
engaged
in
an
attempt
*NL*
to
round
off
a
memorable
day
in
a
burst
of
evening
harmony
,
*NL*
was
contradicted
by
certain
peculiarities
of
reverberation
.
But
*NL*
inexplicability
did
not
rouse
him
to
more
than
a
cursory
heed
;
his
sense
*NL*
of
degradation
was
too
strong
for
the
admission
of
foreign
ideas
;
and
he
*NL*
leant
against
the
parapet
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
39
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Farfrae
descended
out
of
the
loft
breathless
from
his
encounter
*NL*
with
Henchard
,
he
paused
at
the
bottom
to
recover
himself
.
He
arrived
*NL*
at
the
yard
with
the
intention
of
putting
the
horse
into
the
gig
himself
*NL*
-LRB-
all
the
men
having
a
holiday
-RRB-
,
and
driving
to
a
village
on
the
Budmouth
*NL*
Road
.
Despite
the
fearful
struggle
he
decided
still
to
persevere
in
his
*NL*
journey
,
so
as
to
recover
himself
before
going
indoors
and
meeting
the
*NL*
eyes
of
Lucetta
.
He
wished
to
consider
his
course
in
a
case
so
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
driving
off
Whittle
arrived
with
a
note
*NL*
badly
addressed
,
and
bearing
the
word
``
immediate
''
upon
the
outside
.
On
*NL*
opening
it
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
unsigned
.
It
contained
*NL*
a
brief
request
that
he
would
go
to
Weatherbury
that
evening
about
some
*NL*
business
which
he
was
conducting
there
.
Farfrae
knew
nothing
that
could
*NL*
make
it
pressing
;
but
as
he
was
bent
upon
going
out
he
yielded
to
the
*NL*
anonymous
request
,
particularly
as
he
had
a
call
to
make
at
Mellstock
*NL*
which
could
be
included
in
the
same
tour
.
Thereupon
he
told
Whittle
of
*NL*
his
change
of
direction
,
in
words
which
Henchard
had
overheard
,
and
set
*NL*
out
on
his
way
.
Farfrae
had
not
directed
his
man
to
take
the
message
*NL*
indoors
,
and
Whittle
had
not
been
supposed
to
do
so
on
his
own
*NL*
responsibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
anonymous
letter
was
a
well-intentioned
but
clumsy
contrivance
*NL*
of
Longways
and
other
of
Farfrae
's
men
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
for
*NL*
the
evening
,
in
order
that
the
satirical
mummery
should
fall
flat
,
if
it
*NL*
were
attempted
.
By
giving
open
information
they
would
have
brought
down
*NL*
upon
their
heads
the
vengeance
of
those
among
their
comrades
who
enjoyed
*NL*
these
boisterous
old
games
;
and
therefore
the
plan
of
sending
a
letter
*NL*
recommended
itself
by
its
indirectness
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
poor
Lucetta
they
took
no
protective
measure
,
believing
with
the
*NL*
majority
there
was
some
truth
in
the
scandal
,
which
she
would
have
to
*NL*
bear
as
she
best
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
eight
o'clock
,
and
Lucetta
was
sitting
in
the
drawing-room
*NL*
alone
.
Night
had
set
in
for
more
than
half
an
hour
,
but
she
had
not
had
*NL*
the
candles
lighted
,
for
when
Farfrae
was
away
she
preferred
waiting
for
*NL*
him
by
the
firelight
,
and
,
if
it
were
not
too
cold
,
keeping
one
of
the
*NL*
window-sashes
a
little
way
open
that
the
sound
of
his
wheels
might
reach
*NL*
her
ears
early
.
She
was
leaning
back
in
the
chair
,
in
a
more
hopeful
*NL*
mood
than
she
had
enjoyed
since
her
marriage
.
The
day
had
been
such
*NL*
a
success
,
and
the
temporary
uneasiness
which
Henchard
's
show
of
*NL*
effrontery
had
wrought
in
her
disappeared
with
the
quiet
disappearance
*NL*
of
Henchard
himself
under
her
husband
's
reproof
.
The
floating
evidences
*NL*
of
her
absurd
passion
for
him
,
and
its
consequences
,
had
been
destroyed
,
*NL*
and
she
really
seemed
to
have
no
cause
for
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reverie
in
which
these
and
other
subjects
mingled
was
disturbed
by
*NL*
a
hubbub
in
the
distance
,
that
increased
moment
by
moment
.
It
did
not
*NL*
greatly
surprise
her
,
the
afternoon
having
been
given
up
to
recreation
*NL*
by
a
majority
of
the
populace
since
the
passage
of
the
Royal
equipages
.
*NL*
But
her
attention
was
at
once
riveted
to
the
matter
by
the
voice
of
a
*NL*
maid-servant
next
door
,
who
spoke
from
an
upper
window
across
the
street
*NL*
to
some
other
maid
even
more
elevated
than
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
be
they
going
now
?
''
inquired
the
first
with
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
sure
for
a
moment
,
''
said
the
second
,
``
because
of
the
*NL*
malter
's
chimbley
.
O
yes
--
I
can
see
'em
.
Well
,
I
declare
,
I
declare
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
?
''
from
the
first
,
more
enthusiastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
coming
up
Corn
Street
after
all
!
They
sit
back
to
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
two
of
'em
--
are
there
two
figures
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Two
images
on
a
donkey
,
back
to
back
,
their
elbows
tied
to
one
*NL*
another
's
!
She
's
facing
the
head
,
and
he
's
facing
the
tail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
meant
for
anybody
in
particular
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
mid
be
.
The
man
has
got
on
a
blue
coat
and
kerseymere
*NL*
leggings
;
he
has
black
whiskers
,
and
a
reddish
face
.
'T
is
a
stuffed
*NL*
figure
,
with
a
falseface
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
din
was
increasing
now
--
then
it
lessened
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
I
sha
n't
see
,
after
all
!
''
cried
the
disappointed
first
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
gone
into
a
back
street
--
that
's
all
,
''
said
the
one
who
*NL*
occupied
the
enviable
position
in
the
attic
.
``
There
--
now
I
have
got
'em
*NL*
all
endways
nicely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
woman
like
?
Just
say
,
and
I
can
tell
in
a
moment
if
't
is
*NL*
meant
for
one
I
've
in
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
--
why
--
't
is
dressed
just
as
SHE
dressed
when
she
sat
in
the
front
*NL*
seat
at
the
time
the
play-actors
came
to
the
Town
Hall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucetta
started
to
her
feet
,
and
almost
at
the
instant
the
door
of
the
*NL*
room
was
quickly
and
softly
opened
.
Elizabeth-Jane
advanced
into
the
*NL*
firelight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
see
you
,
''
she
said
breathlessly
.
``
I
did
not
stop
to
*NL*
knock
--
forgive
me
!
I
see
you
have
not
shut
your
shutters
,
and
the
window
*NL*
is
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
Lucetta
's
reply
she
crossed
quickly
to
the
window
*NL*
and
pulled
out
one
of
the
shutters
.
Lucetta
glided
to
her
side
.
``
Let
*NL*
it
be
--
hush
!
''
she
said
peremporily
,
in
a
dry
voice
,
while
she
seized
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
by
the
hand
,
and
held
up
her
finger
.
Their
intercourse
*NL*
had
been
so
low
and
hurried
that
not
a
word
had
been
lost
of
the
*NL*
conversation
without
,
which
had
thus
proceeded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
neck
is
uncovered
,
and
her
hair
in
bands
,
and
her
back-comb
in
*NL*
place
;
she
's
got
on
a
puce
silk
,
and
white
stockings
,
and
coloured
*NL*
shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Elizabeth-Jane
attempted
to
close
the
window
,
but
Lucetta
held
her
*NL*
by
main
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
me
!
''
she
said
,
with
a
face
pale
as
death
.
``
A
procession
--
a
*NL*
scandal
--
an
effigy
of
me
,
and
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
Elizabeth
betrayed
that
the
latter
knew
it
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
shut
it
out
,
''
coaxed
Elizabeth-Jane
,
noting
that
the
rigid
*NL*
wildness
of
Lucetta
's
features
was
growing
yet
more
rigid
and
wild
with
*NL*
the
meaning
of
the
noise
and
laughter
.
``
Let
us
shut
it
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
use
!
''
she
shrieked
.
``
He
will
see
it
,
wo
n't
he
?
Donald
will
*NL*
see
it
!
He
is
just
coming
home
--
and
it
will
break
his
heart
--
he
will
*NL*
never
love
me
any
more
--
and
O
,
it
will
kill
me
--
kill
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
was
frantic
now
.
``
O
,
ca
n't
something
be
done
to
stop
it
?
''
*NL*
she
cried
.
``
Is
there
nobody
to
do
it
--
not
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
relinquished
Lucetta
's
hands
,
and
ran
to
the
door
.
Lucetta
herself
,
*NL*
saying
recklessly
``
I
will
see
it
!
''
turned
to
the
window
,
threw
up
the
*NL*
sash
,
and
went
out
upon
the
balcony
.
Elizabeth
immediately
followed
,
and
*NL*
put
her
arm
round
her
to
pull
her
in
.
Lucetta
's
eyes
were
straight
upon
*NL*
the
spectacle
of
the
uncanny
revel
,
now
dancing
rapidly
.
The
numerous
*NL*
lights
round
the
two
effigies
threw
them
up
into
lurid
distinctness
;
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
pair
for
other
than
the
intended
victims
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
come
in
,
''
implored
Elizabeth
;
``
and
let
me
shut
the
window
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
me
--
she
's
me
--
even
to
the
parasol
--
my
green
parasol
!
''
cried
*NL*
Lucetta
with
a
wild
laugh
as
she
stepped
in
.
She
stood
motionless
for
*NL*
one
second
--
then
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
instant
of
her
fall
the
rude
music
of
the
skimmington
*NL*
ceased
.
The
roars
of
sarcastic
laughter
went
off
in
ripples
,
and
the
*NL*
trampling
died
out
like
the
rustle
of
a
spent
wind
.
Elizabeth
was
only
*NL*
indirectly
conscious
of
this
;
she
had
rung
the
bell
,
and
was
bending
*NL*
over
Lucetta
,
who
remained
convulsed
on
the
carpet
in
the
paroxysms
of
*NL*
an
epileptic
seizure
.
She
rang
again
and
again
,
in
vain
;
the
probability
*NL*
being
that
the
servants
had
all
run
out
of
the
house
to
see
more
of
the
*NL*
Daemonic
Sabbath
than
they
could
see
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Farfrae
's
man
,
who
had
been
agape
on
the
doorstep
,
came
up
;
*NL*
then
the
cook
.
The
shutters
,
hastily
pushed
to
by
Elizabeth
,
were
quite
*NL*
closed
,
a
light
was
obtained
,
Lucetta
carried
to
her
room
,
and
the
man
*NL*
sent
off
for
a
doctor
.
While
Elizabeth
was
undressing
her
she
recovered
*NL*
consciousness
;
but
as
soon
as
she
remembered
what
had
passed
the
fit
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
arrived
with
unhoped-for
promptitude
;
he
had
been
standing
*NL*
at
his
door
,
like
others
,
wondering
what
the
uproar
meant
.
As
soon
as
he
*NL*
saw
the
unhappy
sufferer
he
said
,
in
answer
to
Elizabeth
's
mute
appeal
,
*NL*
``
This
is
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
fit
,
''
Elizabeth
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
a
fit
in
the
present
state
of
her
health
means
mischief
.
You
*NL*
must
send
at
once
for
Mr.
Farfrae
.
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
driven
into
the
country
,
sir
,
''
said
the
parlour-maid
;
``
to
some
*NL*
place
on
the
Budmouth
Road
.
He
's
likely
to
be
back
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
he
must
be
sent
for
,
in
case
he
should
not
hurry
.
''
The
*NL*
doctor
returned
to
the
bedside
again
.
The
man
was
despatched
,
and
they
*NL*
soon
heard
him
clattering
out
of
the
yard
at
the
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Mr.
Benjamin
Grower
,
that
prominent
burgess
of
whom
mention
*NL*
has
been
already
made
,
hearing
the
din
of
cleavers
,
tongs
,
tambourines
,
*NL*
kits
,
crouds
,
humstrums
,
serpents
,
rams
'
-
horns
,
and
other
historical
*NL*
kinds
of
music
as
he
sat
indoors
in
the
High
Street
,
had
put
on
his
hat
*NL*
and
gone
out
to
learn
the
cause
.
He
came
to
the
corner
above
Farfrae
's
,
*NL*
and
soon
guessed
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
;
for
being
a
native
of
*NL*
the
town
he
had
witnessed
such
rough
jests
before
.
His
first
move
was
*NL*
to
search
hither
and
thither
for
the
constables
,
there
were
two
in
the
*NL*
town
,
shrivelled
men
whom
he
ultimately
found
in
hiding
up
an
alley
yet
*NL*
more
shrivelled
than
usual
,
having
some
not
ungrounded
fears
that
they
*NL*
might
be
roughly
handled
if
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
we
two
poor
lammigers
do
against
such
a
multitude
!
''
*NL*
expostulated
Stubberd
,
in
answer
to
Mr.
Grower
's
chiding
.
''
'T
is
tempting
*NL*
'em
to
commit
felo-de-se
upon
us
,
and
that
would
be
the
death
of
the
*NL*
perpetrator
;
and
we
would
n't
be
the
cause
of
a
fellow-creature
's
death
*NL*
on
no
account
,
not
we
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
some
help
,
then
!
Here
,
I
'll
come
with
you
.
We
'll
see
what
a
few
*NL*
words
of
authority
can
do
.
Quick
now
;
have
you
got
your
staves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
n't
want
the
folk
to
notice
us
as
law
officers
,
being
so
*NL*
short-handed
,
sir
;
so
we
pushed
our
Gover
`
ment
staves
up
this
*NL*
water-pipe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
with
'em
,
and
come
along
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
Ah
,
here
's
Mr.
*NL*
Blowbody
;
that
's
lucky
.
''
-LRB-
Blowbody
was
the
third
of
the
three
borough
*NL*
magistrates
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
's
the
row
?
''
said
Blowbody
.
``
Got
their
names
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Now
,
''
said
Grower
to
one
of
the
constables
,
``
you
go
with
Mr.
*NL*
Blowbody
round
by
the
Old
Walk
and
come
up
the
street
;
and
I
'll
go
with
*NL*
Stubberd
straight
forward
.
By
this
plan
we
shall
have
'em
between
us
.
*NL*
Get
their
names
only
:
no
attack
or
interruption
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
started
.
But
as
Stubberd
with
Mr.
Grower
advanced
into
Corn
*NL*
Street
,
whence
the
sounds
had
proceeded
,
they
were
surprised
that
no
*NL*
procession
could
be
seen
.
They
passed
Farfrae
's
,
and
looked
to
the
end
*NL*
of
the
street
.
The
lamp
flames
waved
,
the
Walk
trees
soughed
,
a
few
*NL*
loungers
stood
about
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
.
Everything
was
*NL*
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
a
motley
crowd
making
a
disturbance
?
''
Grower
said
*NL*
magisterially
to
one
of
these
in
a
fustian
jacket
,
who
smoked
a
short
*NL*
pipe
and
wore
straps
round
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beg
yer
pardon
,
sir
?
''
blandly
said
the
person
addressed
,
who
was
no
*NL*
other
than
Charl
,
of
Peter
's
Finger
.
Mr.
Grower
repeated
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charl
shook
his
head
to
the
zero
of
childlike
ignorance
.
``
No
;
we
have
n't
*NL*
seen
anything
;
have
we
,
Joe
?
And
you
was
here
afore
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
was
quite
as
blank
as
the
other
in
his
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
that
's
odd
,
''
said
Mr.
Grower
.
``
Ah
--
here
's
a
respectable
man
coming
*NL*
that
I
know
by
sight
.
Have
you
,
''
he
inquired
,
addressing
the
nearing
*NL*
shape
of
Jopp
,
``
have
you
seen
any
gang
of
fellows
making
a
devil
of
a
*NL*
noise

skimmington
riding
,
or
something
of
the
sort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
--
nothing
,
sir
,
''
Jopp
replied
,
as
if
receiving
the
most
singular
*NL*
news
.
``
But
I
've
not
been
far
tonight
,
so
perhaps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
't
was
here
--
just
here
,
''
said
the
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
've
noticed
,
come
to
think
o

t
that
the
wind
in
the
Walk
trees

makes
a
peculiar
poetical-like
murmur
to-night
,
sir
;
more
than
common
;
*NL*
so
perhaps
't
was
that
?
''
Jopp
suggested
,
as
he
rearranged
his
hand
in
his
*NL*
greatcoat
pocket
-LRB-
where
it
ingeniously
supported
a
pair
of
kitchen
tongs
*NL*
and
a
cow
's
horn
,
thrust
up
under
his
waistcoat
-RRB-

*NL*
``
No

no

Constable

come
this
way
.
They
must
*NL*
have
gone
into
the
back
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
in
back
street
nor
in
front
street
,
however
,
could
the
*NL*
disturbers
be
perceived
,
and
Blowbody
and
the
second
constable
,
who
*NL*
came
up
at
this
time
,
brought
similar
intelligence
.
Effigies
,
donkey
,
*NL*
lanterns
,
band
,
all
had
disappeared
like
the
crew
of
Comus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Mr.
Grower
,
``
there
's
only
one
thing
more
we
can
do
.
Get
ye
*NL*
half-a-dozen
helpers
,
and
go
in
a
body
to
Mixen
Lane
,
and
into
Peter
's
*NL*
finger
.
I
'm
much
mistaken
if
you
do
n't
find
a
clue
to
the
perpetrators
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rusty-jointed
executors
of
the
law
mustered
assistance
as
soon
as
*NL*
they
could
,
and
the
whole
party
marched
off
to
the
lane
of
notoriety
.
It
*NL*
was
no
rapid
matter
to
get
there
at
night
,
not
a
lamp
or
glimmer
of
*NL*
any
sort
offering
itself
to
light
the
way
,
except
an
occasional
pale
*NL*
radiance
through
some
window-curtain
,
or
through
the
chink
of
some
door
*NL*
which
could
not
be
closed
because
of
the
smoky
chimney
within
.
At
last
*NL*
they
entered
the
inn
boldly
,
by
the
till
then
bolted
front-door
,
after
a
*NL*
prolonged
knocking
of
loudness
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
their
*NL*
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
settles
of
the
large
room
,
guyed
to
the
ceiling
by
cords
as
*NL*
usual
for
stability
,
an
ordinary
group
sat
drinking
and
smoking
with
*NL*
statuesque
quiet
of
demeanour
.
The
landlady
looked
mildly
at
the
*NL*
invaders
,
saying
in
honest
accents
,
``
Good
evening
,
gentlemen
;
there
's
*NL*
plenty
of
room
.
I
hope
there
's
nothing
amiss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
round
the
room
.
``
Surely
,
''
said
Stubberd
to
one
of
the
men
,
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
by
now
in
Corn
Street
--
Mr.
Grower
spoke
to
`
ee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
who
was
Charl
,
shook
his
head
absently
.
``
I
've
been
here
this
*NL*
last
hour
,
hai
n't
I
,
Nance
?
''
he
said
to
the
woman
who
meditatively
*NL*
sipped
her
ale
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
that
you
have
.
I
came
in
for
my
quiet
suppertime
half-pint
,
and
*NL*
you
were
here
then
,
as
well
as
all
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
constable
was
facing
the
clock-case
,
where
he
saw
reflected
in
*NL*
the
glass
a
quick
motion
by
the
landlady
.
Turning
sharply
,
he
caught
her
*NL*
closing
the
oven-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
curious
about
that
oven
,
ma'am
!
''
he
observed
advancing
,
*NL*
opening
it
,
and
drawing
out
a
tambourine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
she
said
apologetically
,
``
that
's
what
we
keep
here
to
use
when
*NL*
there
's
a
little
quiet
dancing
.
You
see
damp
weather
spoils
it
,
so
I
put
*NL*
it
there
to
keep
it
dry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
nodded
knowingly
,
but
what
he
knew
was
nothing
.
Nohow
*NL*
could
anything
be
elicited
from
this
mute
and
inoffensive
assembly
.
In
*NL*
a
few
minutes
the
investigators
went
out
,
and
joining
those
of
their
*NL*
auxiliaries
who
had
been
left
at
the
door
they
pursued
their
way
*NL*
elsewhither
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
40
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Long
before
this
time
Henchard
,
weary
of
his
ruminations
on
the
bridge
,
*NL*
had
repaired
towards
the
town
.
When
he
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
*NL*
a
procession
burst
upon
his
view
,
in
the
act
of
turning
out
of
an
alley
*NL*
just
above
him
.
The
lanterns
,
horns
,
and
multitude
startled
him
;
he
saw
*NL*
the
mounted
images
,
and
knew
what
it
all
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
way
,
entered
another
street
,
and
disappeared
.
He
turned
*NL*
back
a
few
steps
and
was
lost
in
grave
reflection
,
finally
wending
his
*NL*
way
homeward
by
the
obscure
river-side
path
.
Unable
to
rest
there
he
*NL*
went
to
his
step-daughter
's
lodging
,
and
was
told
that
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
had
gone
to
Mr.
Farfrae
's
.
Like
one
acting
in
obedience
to
a
charm
,
and
*NL*
with
a
nameless
apprehension
,
he
followed
in
the
same
direction
in
the
*NL*
hope
of
meeting
her
,
the
roysterers
having
vanished
.
Disappointed
in
*NL*
this
he
gave
the
gentlest
of
pulls
to
the
door-bell
,
and
then
learnt
*NL*
particulars
of
what
had
occurred
,
together
with
the
doctor
's
imperative
*NL*
orders
that
Farfrae
should
be
brought
home
,
and
how
they
had
set
out
to
*NL*
meet
him
on
the
Budmouth
Road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
has
gone
to
Mellstock
and
Weatherbury
!
''
exclaimed
Henchard
,
now
*NL*
unspeakably
grieved
.
``
Not
Budmouth
way
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
alas
!
for
Henchard
;
he
had
lost
his
good
name
.
They
would
*NL*
not
believe
him
,
taking
his
words
but
as
the
frothy
utterances
of
*NL*
recklessness
.
Though
Lucetta
's
life
seemed
at
that
moment
to
depend
upon
*NL*
her
husband
's
return
-LRB-
she
being
in
great
mental
agony
lest
he
should
*NL*
never
know
the
unexaggerated
truth
of
her
past
relations
with
Henchard
-RRB-
,
*NL*
no
messenger
was
despatched
towards
Weatherbury
.
Henchard
,
in
a
state
of
*NL*
bitter
anxiety
and
contrition
,
determined
to
seek
Farfrae
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
end
he
hastened
down
the
town
,
ran
along
the
eastern
road
over
*NL*
Durnover
Moor
,
up
the
hill
beyond
,
and
thus
onward
in
the
moderate
*NL*
darkness
of
this
spring
night
till
he
had
reached
a
second
and
almost
*NL*
a
third
hill
about
three
miles
distant
.
In
Yalbury
Bottom
,
or
Plain
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
he
listened
.
At
first
nothing
,
beyond
his
own
*NL*
heart-throbs
,
was
to
be
heard
but
the
slow
wind
making
its
moan
among
*NL*
the
masses
of
spruce
and
larch
of
Yalbury
Wood
which
clothed
the
heights
*NL*
on
either
hand
;
but
presently
there
came
the
sound
of
light
wheels
*NL*
whetting
their
felloes
against
the
newly
stoned
patches
of
road
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
the
distant
glimmer
of
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
it
was
Farfrae
's
gig
descending
the
hill
from
an
indescribable
*NL*
personality
in
its
noise
,
the
vehicle
having
been
his
own
till
bought
*NL*
by
the
Scotchman
at
the
sale
of
his
effects
.
Henchard
thereupon
retraced
*NL*
his
steps
along
Yalbury
Plain
,
the
gig
coming
up
with
him
as
its
driver
*NL*
slackened
speed
between
two
plantations
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
point
in
the
highway
near
which
the
road
to
Mellstock
branched
*NL*
off
from
the
homeward
direction
.
By
diverging
to
that
village
,
as
he
had
*NL*
intended
to
do
,
Farfrae
might
probably
delay
his
return
by
a
couple
of
*NL*
hours
.
It
soon
appeared
that
his
intention
was
to
do
so
still
,
the
*NL*
light
swerving
towards
Cuckoo
Lane
,
the
by-road
aforesaid
.
Farfrae
's
off
*NL*
gig-lamp
flashed
in
Henchard
's
face
.
At
the
same
time
Farfrae
discerned
*NL*
his
late
antagonist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farfrae
--
Mr.
Farfrae
!
''
cried
the
breathless
Henchard
,
holding
up
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
allowed
the
horse
to
turn
several
steps
into
the
branch
lane
*NL*
before
he
pulled
up
.
He
then
drew
rein
,
and
said
``
Yes
?
''
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
as
one
would
towards
a
pronounced
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
to
Casterbridge
at
once
!
''
Henchard
said
.
``
There
's
something
*NL*
wrong
at
your
house
--
requiring
your
return
.
I
've
run
all
the
way
here
on
*NL*
purpose
to
tell
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
was
silent
,
and
at
his
silence
Henchard
's
soul
sank
within
him
.
*NL*
Why
had
he
not
,
before
this
,
thought
of
what
was
only
too
obvious
?
He
*NL*
who
,
four
hours
earlier
,
had
enticed
Farfrae
into
a
deadly
wrestle
stood
*NL*
now
in
the
darkness
of
late
night-time
on
a
lonely
road
,
inviting
him
*NL*
to
come
a
particular
way
,
where
an
assailant
might
have
confederates
,
*NL*
instead
of
going
his
purposed
way
,
where
there
might
be
a
better
*NL*
opportunity
of
guarding
himself
from
attack
.
Henchard
could
almost
feel
*NL*
this
view
of
things
in
course
of
passage
through
Farfrae
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
go
to
Mellstock
,
''
said
Farfrae
coldly
,
as
he
loosened
his
*NL*
reins
to
move
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
implored
Henchard
,
``
the
matter
is
more
serious
than
your
business
*NL*
at
Mellstock
.
It
is
--
your
wife
!
She
is
ill
.
I
can
tell
you
particulars
*NL*
as
we
go
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
agitation
and
abruptness
of
Henchard
increased
Farfrae
's
*NL*
suspicion
that
this
was
a
ruse
to
decoy
him
on
to
the
next
wood
,
where
*NL*
might
be
effectually
compassed
what
,
from
policy
or
want
of
nerve
,
*NL*
Henchard
had
failed
to
do
earlier
in
the
day
.
He
started
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
think
,
''
deprecated
Henchard
running
after
,
almost
bowed
*NL*
down
with
despair
as
he
perceived
the
image
of
unscrupulous
villainy
*NL*
that
he
assumed
in
his
former
friend
's
eyes
.
``
But
I
am
not
what
you
*NL*
think
!
''
he
cried
hoarsely
.
``
Believe
me
,
Farfrae
;
I
have
come
entirely
on
*NL*
your
own
and
your
wife
's
account
.
She
is
in
danger
.
I
know
no
more
;
and
*NL*
they
want
you
to
come
.
Your
man
has
gone
the
other
way
in
a
mistake
.
O
*NL*
Farfrae
!
do
n't
mistrust
me
--
I
am
a
wretched
man
;
but
my
heart
is
true
to
*NL*
you
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
,
however
,
did
distrust
him
utterly
.
He
knew
his
wife
was
*NL*
with
child
,
but
he
had
left
her
not
long
ago
in
perfect
health
;
and
*NL*
Henchard
's
treachery
was
more
credible
than
his
story
.
He
had
in
his
*NL*
time
heard
bitter
ironies
from
Henchard
's
lips
,
and
there
might
be
*NL*
ironies
now
.
He
quickened
the
horse
's
pace
,
and
had
soon
risen
into
the
*NL*
high
country
lying
between
there
and
Mellstock
,
Henchard
's
spasmodic
run
*NL*
after
him
lending
yet
more
substance
to
his
thought
of
evil
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gig
and
its
driver
lessened
against
the
sky
in
Henchard
's
eyes
;
*NL*
his
exertions
for
Farfrae
's
good
had
been
in
vain
.
Over
this
repentant
*NL*
sinner
,
at
least
,
there
was
to
be
no
joy
in
heaven
.
He
cursed
himself
*NL*
like
a
less
scrupulous
Job
,
as
a
vehement
man
will
do
when
he
loses
*NL*
self-respect
,
the
last
mental
prop
under
poverty
.
To
this
he
had
come
*NL*
after
a
time
of
emotional
darkness
of
which
the
adjoining
woodland
shade
*NL*
afforded
inadequate
illustration
.
Presently
he
began
to
walk
back
again
*NL*
along
the
way
by
which
he
had
arrived
.
Farfrae
should
at
all
events
have
*NL*
no
reason
for
delay
upon
the
road
by
seeing
him
there
when
he
took
his
*NL*
journey
homeward
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arriving
at
Casterbridge
Henchard
went
again
to
Farfrae
's
house
to
make
*NL*
inquiries
.
As
soon
as
the
door
opened
anxious
faces
confronted
his
*NL*
from
the
staircase
,
hall
,
and
landing
;
and
they
all
said
in
grievous
*NL*
disappointment
,
``
O
--
it
is
not
he
!
''
The
manservant
,
finding
his
mistake
,
*NL*
had
long
since
returned
,
and
all
hopes
had
centred
upon
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
n't
you
found
him
?
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I
can
not
tell
`
ee
!
''
Henchard
replied
as
he
sank
down
on
a
chair
*NL*
within
the
entrance
.
``
He
ca
n't
be
home
for
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
,
''
said
the
surgeon
,
returning
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
?
''
asked
Henchard
of
Elizabeth
,
who
formed
one
of
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
great
danger
,
father
.
Her
anxiety
to
see
her
husband
makes
her
*NL*
fearfully
restless
.
Poor
woman
--
I
fear
they
have
killed
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
regarded
the
sympathetic
speaker
for
a
few
instants
as
if
she
*NL*
struck
him
in
a
new
light
,
then
,
without
further
remark
,
went
out
of
*NL*
the
door
and
onward
to
his
lonely
cottage
.
So
much
for
man
's
rivalry
,
*NL*
he
thought
.
Death
was
to
have
the
oyster
,
and
Farfrae
and
himself
the
*NL*
shells
.
But
about
Elizabeth-Jane
;
in
the
midst
of
his
gloom
she
seemed
*NL*
to
him
as
a
pin-point
of
light
.
He
had
liked
the
look
on
her
face
as
she
*NL*
answered
him
from
the
stairs
.
There
had
been
affection
in
it
,
and
above
*NL*
all
things
what
he
desired
now
was
affection
from
anything
that
was
good
*NL*
and
pure
.
She
was
not
his
own
,
yet
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
had
a
faint
*NL*
dream
that
he
might
get
to
like
her
as
his
own
,
--
if
she
would
only
*NL*
continue
to
love
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jopp
was
just
going
to
bed
when
Henchard
got
home
.
As
the
latter
entered
*NL*
the
door
Jopp
said
,
``
This
is
rather
bad
about
Mrs.
Farfrae
's
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Henchard
shortly
,
though
little
dreaming
of
Jopp
's
*NL*
complicity
in
the
night
's
harlequinade
,
and
raising
his
eyes
just
*NL*
sufficiently
to
observe
that
Jopp
's
face
was
lined
with
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
has
called
for
you
,
''
continued
Jopp
,
when
Henchard
was
*NL*
shutting
himself
into
his
own
apartment
.
``
A
kind
of
traveller
,
or
*NL*
sea-captain
of
some
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
?
--
who
could
he
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seemed
a
well-be-doing
man
--
had
grey
hair
and
a
broadish
face
;
but
*NL*
he
gave
no
name
,
and
no
message
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
do
I
gi'e
him
any
attention
.
''
And
,
saying
this
,
Henchard
closed
his
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
divergence
to
Mellstock
delayed
Farfrae
's
return
very
nearly
the
*NL*
two
hours
of
Henchard
's
estimate
.
Among
the
other
urgent
reasons
for
his
*NL*
presence
had
been
the
need
of
his
authority
to
send
to
Budmouth
for
a
*NL*
second
physician
;
and
when
at
length
Farfrae
did
come
back
he
was
in
*NL*
a
state
bordering
on
distraction
at
his
misconception
of
Henchard
's
*NL*
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
messenger
was
despatched
to
Budmouth
,
late
as
it
had
grown
;
the
night
*NL*
wore
on
,
and
the
other
doctor
came
in
the
small
hours
.
Lucetta
had
been
*NL*
much
soothed
by
Donald
's
arrival
;
he
seldom
or
never
left
her
side
;
and
*NL*
when
,
immediately
after
his
entry
,
she
had
tried
to
lisp
out
to
him
the
*NL*
secret
which
so
oppressed
her
,
he
checked
her
feeble
words
,
lest
talking
*NL*
should
be
dangerous
,
assuring
her
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
tell
him
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
time
he
knew
nothing
of
the
skimmington-ride
.
The
dangerous
*NL*
illness
and
miscarriage
of
Mrs.
Farfrae
was
soon
rumoured
through
the
*NL*
town
,
and
an
apprehensive
guess
having
been
given
as
to
its
cause
by
the
*NL*
leaders
in
the
exploit
,
compunction
and
fear
threw
a
dead
silence
over
*NL*
all
particulars
of
their
orgie
;
while
those
immediately
around
Lucetta
*NL*
would
not
venture
to
add
to
her
husband
's
distress
by
alluding
to
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
,
and
how
much
,
Farfrae
's
wife
ultimately
explained
to
him
of
her
*NL*
past
entanglement
with
Henchard
,
when
they
were
alone
in
the
solitude
of
*NL*
that
sad
night
,
can
not
be
told
.
That
she
informed
him
of
the
bare
*NL*
facts
of
her
peculiar
intimacy
with
the
corn-merchant
became
plain
from
*NL*
Farfrae
's
own
statements
.
But
in
respect
of
her
subsequent
conduct
--
her
*NL*
motive
in
coming
to
Casterbridge
to
unite
herself
with
Henchard
--
her
*NL*
assumed
justification
in
abandoning
him
when
she
discovered
reasons
for
*NL*
fearing
him
-LRB-
though
in
truth
her
inconsequent
passion
for
another
man
*NL*
at
first
sight
had
most
to
do
with
that
abandonment
-RRB-
--
her
method
of
*NL*
reconciling
to
her
conscience
a
marriage
with
the
second
when
she
was
*NL*
in
a
measure
committed
to
the
first
:
to
what
extent
she
spoke
of
these
*NL*
things
remained
Farfrae
's
secret
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
watchman
who
called
the
hours
and
weather
in
Casterbridge
*NL*
that
night
there
walked
a
figure
up
and
down
Corn
Street
hardly
less
*NL*
frequently
.
It
was
Henchard
's
,
whose
retiring
to
rest
had
proved
itself
*NL*
a
futility
as
soon
as
attempted
;
and
he
gave
it
up
to
go
hither
and
*NL*
thither
,
and
make
inquiries
about
the
patient
every
now
and
then
.
*NL*
He
called
as
much
on
Farfrae
's
account
as
on
Lucetta
's
,
and
on
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
's
even
more
than
on
either
's
.
Shorn
one
by
one
of
all
*NL*
other
interests
,
his
life
seemed
centring
on
the
personality
of
the
*NL*
stepdaughter
whose
presence
but
recently
he
could
not
endure
.
To
see
her
*NL*
on
each
occasion
of
his
inquiry
at
Lucetta
's
was
a
comfort
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
of
his
calls
was
made
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
in
the
*NL*
steely
light
of
dawn
.
Lucifer
was
fading
into
day
across
Durnover
Moor
,
*NL*
the
sparrows
were
just
alighting
into
the
street
,
and
the
hens
had
begun
*NL*
to
cackle
from
the
outhouses
.
When
within
a
few
yards
of
Farfrae
's
he
*NL*
saw
the
door
gently
opened
,
and
a
servant
raise
her
hand
to
the
knocker
,
*NL*
to
untie
the
piece
of
cloth
which
had
muffled
it
.
He
went
across
,
the
*NL*
sparrows
in
his
way
scarcely
flying
up
from
the
road-litter
,
so
little
*NL*
did
they
believe
in
human
aggression
at
so
early
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
take
off
that
?
''
said
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
in
some
surprise
at
his
presence
,
and
did
not
answer
for
an
*NL*
instant
or
two
.
Recognizing
him
,
she
said
,
``
Because
they
may
knock
as
*NL*
loud
as
they
will
;
she
will
never
hear
it
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
41
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
went
home
.
The
morning
having
now
fully
broke
he
lit
his
fire
,
*NL*
and
sat
abstractedly
beside
it
.
He
had
not
sat
there
long
when
a
gentle
*NL*
footstep
approached
the
house
and
entered
the
passage
,
a
finger
tapping
*NL*
lightly
at
the
door
.
Henchard
's
face
brightened
,
for
he
knew
the
motions
*NL*
to
be
Elizabeth
's
.
She
came
into
his
room
,
looking
wan
and
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Mrs.
Farfrae
!
She
is
--
dead
!
Yes
,
*NL*
indeed
--
about
an
hour
ago
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
I
have
but
lately
come
in
from
there
.
It
*NL*
is
so
very
good
of
`
ee
,
Elizabeth
,
to
come
and
tell
me
.
You
must
be
*NL*
so
tired
out
,
too
,
with
sitting
up
.
Now
do
you
bide
here
with
me
this
*NL*
morning
.
You
can
go
and
rest
in
the
other
room
;
and
I
will
call
`
ee
when
*NL*
breakfast
is
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
please
him
,
and
herself
--
for
his
recent
kindliness
was
winning
a
*NL*
surprised
gratitude
from
the
lonely
girl
--
she
did
as
he
bade
her
,
and
*NL*
lay
down
on
a
sort
of
couch
which
Henchard
had
rigged
up
out
of
a
*NL*
settle
in
the
adjoining
room
.
She
could
hear
him
moving
about
in
his
*NL*
preparations
;
but
her
mind
ran
most
strongly
on
Lucetta
,
whose
death
*NL*
in
such
fulness
of
life
and
amid
such
cheerful
hopes
of
maternity
was
*NL*
appallingly
unexpected
.
Presently
she
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
her
stepfather
in
the
outer
room
had
set
the
breakfast
in
*NL*
readiness
;
but
finding
that
she
dozed
he
would
not
call
her
;
he
*NL*
waited
on
,
looking
into
the
fire
and
keeping
the
kettle
boiling
with
*NL*
house-wifely
care
,
as
if
it
were
an
honour
to
have
her
in
his
house
.
In
*NL*
truth
,
a
great
change
had
come
over
him
with
regard
to
her
,
and
he
was
*NL*
developing
the
dream
of
a
future
lit
by
her
filial
presence
,
as
though
*NL*
that
way
alone
could
happiness
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
disturbed
by
another
knock
at
the
door
,
and
rose
to
open
it
,
*NL*
rather
deprecating
a
call
from
anybody
just
then
.
A
stoutly
built
man
*NL*
stood
on
the
doorstep
,
with
an
alien
,
unfamiliar
air
about
his
figure
*NL*
and
bearing
--
an
air
which
might
have
been
called
colonial
by
people
of
*NL*
cosmopolitan
experience
.
It
was
the
man
who
had
asked
the
way
at
Peter
's
*NL*
finger
.
Henchard
nodded
,
and
looked
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
good
morning
,
''
said
the
stranger
with
profuse
heartiness
.
*NL*
``
Is
it
Mr.
Henchard
I
am
talking
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Henchard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
've
caught
`
ee
at
home
--
that
's
right
.
Morning
's
the
time
for
*NL*
business
,
says
I.
Can
I
have
a
few
words
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
Henchard
answered
,
showing
the
way
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
remember
me
?
''
said
his
visitor
,
seating
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
observed
him
indifferently
,
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
perhaps
you
may
not
.
My
name
is
Newson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
face
and
eyes
seemed
to
die
.
The
other
did
not
notice
it
.
``
I
*NL*
know
the
name
well
,
''
Henchard
said
at
last
,
looking
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
no
doubt
of
that
.
Well
,
the
fact
is
,
I
've
been
looking
for
`
ee
*NL*
this
fortnight
past
.
I
landed
at
Havenpool
and
went
through
Casterbridge
*NL*
on
my
way
to
Falmouth
,
and
when
I
got
there
,
they
told
me
you
had
some
*NL*
years
before
been
living
at
Casterbridge
.
Back
came
I
again
,
and
by
long
*NL*
and
by
late
I
got
here
by
coach
,
ten
minutes
ago
.
`
He
lives
down
by
the
*NL*
mill
,
'
says
they
.
So
here
I
am
.
Now
--
that
transaction
between
us
*NL*
some
twenty
years
agone
--
't
is
that
I
've
called
about
.
'T
was
a
curious
*NL*
business
.
I
was
younger
then
than
I
am
now
,
and
perhaps
the
less
said
*NL*
about
it
,
in
one
sense
,
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curious
business
!
'T
was
worse
than
curious
.
I
can
not
even
allow
that
*NL*
I
'm
the
man
you
met
then
.
I
was
not
in
my
senses
,
and
a
man
's
senses
are
*NL*
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
young
and
thoughtless
,
''
said
Newson
.
``
However
,
I
've
come
to
*NL*
mend
matters
rather
than
open
arguments
.
Poor
Susan
--
hers
was
a
strange
*NL*
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
warm-hearted
,
home-spun
woman
.
She
was
not
what
they
call
*NL*
shrewd
or
sharp
at
all
--
better
she
had
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
in
all
likelihood
know
,
she
was
simple-minded
enough
to
think
*NL*
that
the
sale
was
in
a
way
binding
.
She
was
as
guiltless
o
'
wrong-doing
*NL*
in
that
particular
as
a
saint
in
the
clouds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
I
know
it
.
I
found
it
out
directly
,
''
said
Henchard
,
still
*NL*
with
averted
eyes
.
``
There
lay
the
sting
o

t
to
me

If
she
had
seen
it
as
*NL*
what
it
was
she
would
never
have
left
me
.
Never
!
But
how
should
she
be
*NL*
expected
to
know
?
What
advantages
had
she
?
None
.
She
could
write
her
own
*NL*
name
,
and
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
not
in
my
heart
to
undeceive
her
when
the
deed
was
done
,
''
*NL*
said
the
sailor
of
former
days
.
``
I
thought
,
and
there
was
not
much
*NL*
vanity
in
thinking
it
,
that
she
would
be
happier
with
me
.
She
was
fairly
*NL*
happy
,
and
I
never
would
have
undeceived
her
till
the
day
of
her
*NL*
death
.
Your
child
died
;
she
had
another
,
and
all
went
well
.
But
a
time
*NL*
came
--
mind
me
,
a
time
always
does
come
.
A
time
came
--
it
was
some
while
*NL*
after
she
and
I
and
the
child
returned
from
America
--
when
somebody
she
*NL*
had
confided
her
history
to
,
told
her
my
claim
to
her
was
a
mockery
,
and
*NL*
made
a
jest
of
her
belief
in
my
right
.
After
that
she
was
never
happy
*NL*
with
me
.
She
pined
and
pined
,
and
socked
and
sighed
.
She
said
she
must
*NL*
leave
me
,
and
then
came
the
question
of
our
child
.
Then
a
man
advised
*NL*
me
how
to
act
,
and
I
did
it
,
for
I
thought
it
was
best
.
I
left
her
*NL*
at
Falmouth
,
and
went
off
to
sea
.
When
I
got
to
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
Atlantic
there
was
a
storm
,
and
it
was
supposed
that
a
lot
of
*NL*
us
,
including
myself
,
had
been
washed
overboard
.
I
got
ashore
at
*NL*
Newfoundland
,
and
then
I
asked
myself
what
I
should
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Since
I
'm
here
,
here
I
'll
bide
,
'
I
thought
to
myself
;
''
twill
be
most
*NL*
kindness
to
her
,
now
she
's
taken
against
me
,
to
let
her
believe
me
lost
,
*NL*
for
,
'
I
thought
,
`
while
she
supposes
us
both
alive
she
'll
be
miserable
;
*NL*
but
if
she
thinks
me
dead
she
'll
go
back
to
him
,
and
the
child
will
have
*NL*
a
home
.
'
I
've
never
returned
to
this
country
till
a
month
ago
,
and
I
*NL*
found
that
,
as
I
supposed
,
she
went
to
you
,
and
my
daughter
with
*NL*
her
.
They
told
me
in
Falmouth
that
Susan
was
dead
.
But
my
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
--
where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
likewise
,
''
said
Henchard
doggedly
.
``
Surely
you
learnt
that
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
started
up
,
and
took
an
enervated
pace
or
two
down
the
room
.
*NL*
``
Dead
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Then
what
's
the
use
of
my
money
to
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
,
without
answering
,
shook
his
head
as
if
that
were
rather
a
*NL*
question
for
Newson
himself
than
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
buried
?
''
the
traveller
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beside
her
mother
,
''
said
Henchard
,
in
the
same
stolid
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
she
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
year
ago
and
more
,
''
replied
the
other
without
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
continued
standing
.
Henchard
never
looked
up
from
the
floor
.
*NL*
At
last
Newson
said
:
``
My
journey
hither
has
been
for
nothing
!
I
may
as
*NL*
well
go
as
I
came
!
It
has
served
me
right
.
I
'll
trouble
you
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
heard
the
retreating
footsteps
of
Newson
upon
the
sanded
floor
,
*NL*
the
mechanical
lifting
of
the
latch
,
the
slow
opening
and
closing
of
the
*NL*
door
that
was
natural
to
a
baulked
or
dejected
man
;
but
he
did
not
turn
*NL*
his
head
.
Newson
's
shadow
passed
the
window
.
He
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Henchard
,
scarcely
believing
the
evidence
of
his
senses
,
rose
*NL*
from
his
seat
amazed
at
what
he
had
done
.
It
had
been
the
impulse
of
a
*NL*
moment
.
The
regard
he
had
lately
acquired
for
Elizabeth
,
the
new-sprung
*NL*
hope
of
his
loneliness
that
she
would
be
to
him
a
daughter
of
whom
he
*NL*
could
feel
as
proud
as
of
the
actual
daughter
she
still
believed
herself
*NL*
to
be
,
had
been
stimulated
by
the
unexpected
coming
of
Newson
to
a
*NL*
greedy
exclusiveness
in
relation
to
her
;
so
that
the
sudden
prospect
of
*NL*
her
loss
had
caused
him
to
speak
mad
lies
like
a
child
,
in
pure
mockery
*NL*
of
consequences
.
He
had
expected
questions
to
close
in
round
him
,
and
*NL*
unmask
his
fabrication
in
five
minutes
;
yet
such
questioning
had
not
*NL*
come
.
But
surely
they
would
come
;
Newson
's
departure
could
be
but
*NL*
momentary
;
he
would
learn
all
by
inquiries
in
the
town
;
and
return
to
*NL*
curse
him
,
and
carry
his
last
treasure
away
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastily
put
on
his
hat
,
and
went
out
in
the
direction
that
Newson
had
*NL*
taken
.
Newson
's
back
was
soon
visible
up
the
road
,
crossing
Bull-stake
.
*NL*
Henchard
followed
,
and
saw
his
visitor
stop
at
the
King
's
Arms
,
where
*NL*
the
morning
coach
which
had
brought
him
waited
half-an-hour
for
another
*NL*
coach
which
crossed
there
.
The
coach
Newson
had
come
by
was
now
about
to
*NL*
move
again
.
Newson
mounted
,
his
luggage
was
put
in
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
*NL*
the
vehicle
disappeared
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
so
much
as
turned
his
head
.
It
was
an
act
of
simple
faith
*NL*
in
Henchard
's
words
--
faith
so
simple
as
to
be
almost
sublime
.
The
young
*NL*
sailor
who
had
taken
Susan
Henchard
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
on
the
*NL*
faith
of
a
glance
at
her
face
,
more
than
twenty
years
before
,
was
still
*NL*
living
and
acting
under
the
form
of
the
grizzled
traveller
who
had
taken
*NL*
Henchard
's
words
on
trust
so
absolute
as
to
shame
him
as
he
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
Elizabeth-Jane
to
remain
his
by
virtue
of
this
hardy
invention
of
a
*NL*
moment
?
``
Perhaps
not
for
long
,
''
said
he
.
Newson
might
converse
with
his
*NL*
fellow-travellers
,
some
of
whom
might
be
Casterbridge
people
;
and
the
*NL*
trick
would
be
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
probability
threw
Henchard
into
a
defensive
attitude
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
considering
how
best
to
right
the
wrong
,
and
acquaint
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
father
with
the
truth
at
once
,
he
bethought
himself
of
ways
to
keep
the
*NL*
position
he
had
accidentally
won
.
Towards
the
young
woman
herself
his
*NL*
affection
grew
more
jealously
strong
with
each
new
hazard
to
which
his
*NL*
claim
to
her
was
exposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
the
distant
highway
expecting
to
see
Newson
return
on
foot
,
*NL*
enlightened
and
indignant
,
to
claim
his
child
.
But
no
figure
appeared
.
*NL*
Possibly
he
had
spoken
to
nobody
on
the
coach
,
but
buried
his
grief
in
*NL*
his
own
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
grief
!
--
what
was
it
,
after
all
,
to
that
which
he
,
Henchard
,
would
*NL*
feel
at
the
loss
of
her
?
Newson
's
affection
cooled
by
years
,
could
not
*NL*
equal
his
who
had
been
constantly
in
her
presence
.
And
thus
his
jealous
*NL*
soul
speciously
argued
to
excuse
the
separation
of
father
and
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
the
house
half
expecting
that
she
would
have
vanished
.
*NL*
No
;
there
she
was
--
just
coming
out
from
the
inner
room
,
the
marks
of
*NL*
sleep
upon
her
eyelids
,
and
exhibiting
a
generally
refreshed
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
father
!
''
she
said
smiling
.
``
I
had
no
sooner
lain
down
than
I
napped
,
*NL*
though
I
did
not
mean
to
.
I
wonder
I
did
not
dream
about
poor
Mrs.
*NL*
Farfrae
,
after
thinking
of
her
so
;
but
I
did
not
.
How
strange
it
is
that
*NL*
we
do
not
often
dream
of
latest
events
,
absorbing
as
they
may
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
have
been
able
to
sleep
,
''
he
said
,
taking
her
hand
with
*NL*
anxious
proprietorship
--
an
act
which
gave
her
a
pleasant
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
to
breakfast
,
and
Elizabeth-Jane
's
thoughts
reverted
to
*NL*
Lucetta
.
Their
sadness
added
charm
to
a
countenance
whose
beauty
had
*NL*
ever
lain
in
its
meditative
soberness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
she
said
,
as
soon
as
she
recalled
herself
to
the
outspread
*NL*
meal
,
``
it
is
so
kind
of
you
to
get
this
nice
breakfast
with
your
own
*NL*
hands
,
and
I
idly
asleep
the
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
it
every
day
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
have
left
me
;
everybody
has
left
*NL*
me
;
how
should
I
live
but
by
my
own
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
lonely
,
are
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
child
--
to
a
degree
that
you
know
nothing
of
!
It
is
my
own
fault
.
*NL*
You
are
the
only
one
who
has
been
near
me
for
weeks
.
And
you
will
come
*NL*
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
that
?
Indeed
I
will
,
if
you
would
like
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
signified
dubiousness
.
Though
he
had
so
lately
hoped
that
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
might
again
live
in
his
house
as
daughter
,
he
would
*NL*
not
ask
her
to
do
so
now
.
Newson
might
return
at
any
moment
,
and
what
*NL*
Elizabeth
would
think
of
him
for
his
deception
it
were
best
to
bear
*NL*
apart
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
breakfasted
his
stepdaughter
still
lingered
,
till
the
*NL*
moment
arrived
at
which
Henchard
was
accustomed
to
go
to
his
daily
work
.
*NL*
Then
she
arose
,
and
with
assurance
of
coming
again
soon
went
up
the
hill
*NL*
in
the
morning
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
moment
her
heart
is
as
warm
towards
me
as
mine
is
towards
her
,
*NL*
she
would
live
with
me
here
in
this
humble
cottage
for
the
asking
!
Yet
*NL*
before
the
evening
probably
he
will
have
come
,
and
then
she
will
scorn
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reflection
,
constantly
repeated
by
Henchard
to
himself
,
accompanied
*NL*
him
everywhere
through
the
day
.
His
mood
was
no
longer
that
of
the
*NL*
rebellious
,
ironical
,
reckless
misadventurer
;
but
the
leaden
gloom
of
*NL*
one
who
has
lost
all
that
can
make
life
interesting
,
or
even
tolerable
.
*NL*
There
would
remain
nobody
for
him
to
be
proud
of
,
nobody
to
fortify
him
;
*NL*
for
Elizabeth-Jane
would
soon
be
but
as
a
stranger
,
and
worse
.
Susan
,
*NL*
Farfrae
,
Lucetta
,
Elizabeth
--
all
had
gone
from
him
,
one
after
one
,
*NL*
either
by
his
fault
or
by
his
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
place
of
them
he
had
no
interest
,
hobby
,
or
desire
.
If
he
could
have
*NL*
summoned
music
to
his
aid
his
existence
might
even
now
have
been
borne
;
*NL*
for
with
Henchard
music
was
of
regal
power
.
The
merest
trumpet
or
organ
*NL*
tone
was
enough
to
move
him
,
and
high
harmonies
transubstantiated
him
.
*NL*
But
hard
fate
had
ordained
that
he
should
be
unable
to
call
up
this
*NL*
Divine
spirit
in
his
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
land
ahead
of
him
was
as
darkness
itself
;
there
was
nothing
*NL*
to
come
,
nothing
to
wait
for
.
Yet
in
the
natural
course
of
life
he
might
*NL*
possibly
have
to
linger
on
earth
another
thirty
or
forty
years
--
scoffed
*NL*
at
;
at
best
pitied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
it
was
unendurable
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
east
of
Casterbridge
lay
moors
and
meadows
through
which
much
*NL*
water
flowed
.
The
wanderer
in
this
direction
who
should
stand
still
*NL*
for
a
few
moments
on
a
quiet
night
,
might
hear
singular
symphonies
from
*NL*
these
waters
,
as
from
a
lampless
orchestra
,
all
playing
in
their
sundry
*NL*
tones
from
near
and
far
parts
of
the
moor
.
At
a
hole
in
a
rotten
weir
*NL*
they
executed
a
recitative
;
where
a
tributary
brook
fell
over
a
stone
*NL*
breastwork
they
trilled
cheerily
;
under
an
arch
they
performed
a
*NL*
metallic
cymballing
,
and
at
Durnover
Hole
they
hissed
.
The
spot
at
*NL*
which
their
instrumentation
rose
loudest
was
a
place
called
Ten
Hatches
,
*NL*
whence
during
high
springs
there
proceeded
a
very
fugue
of
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
here
was
deep
and
strong
at
all
times
,
and
the
hatches
on
this
*NL*
account
were
raised
and
lowered
by
cogs
and
a
winch
.
A
patch
led
*NL*
from
the
second
bridge
over
the
highway
-LRB-
so
often
mentioned
-RRB-
to
these
*NL*
Hatches
,
crossing
the
stream
at
their
head
by
a
narrow
plank-bridge
.
But
*NL*
after
night-fall
human
beings
were
seldom
found
going
that
way
,
the
path
*NL*
leading
only
to
a
deep
reach
of
the
stream
called
Blackwater
,
and
the
*NL*
passage
being
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
,
however
,
leaving
the
town
by
the
east
road
,
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
second
,
or
stone
bridge
,
and
thence
struck
into
this
path
of
solitude
,
*NL*
following
its
course
beside
the
stream
till
the
dark
shapes
of
the
Ten
*NL*
Hatches
cut
the
sheen
thrown
upon
the
river
by
the
weak
lustre
that
*NL*
still
lingered
in
the
west
.
In
a
second
or
two
he
stood
beside
the
*NL*
weir-hole
where
the
water
was
at
its
deepest
.
He
looked
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
,
and
no
creature
appeared
in
view
.
He
then
took
off
his
coat
*NL*
and
hat
,
and
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
stream
with
his
hands
clasped
in
*NL*
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
eyes
were
bent
on
the
water
beneath
there
slowly
became
*NL*
visible
a
something
floating
in
the
circular
pool
formed
by
the
wash
of
*NL*
centuries
;
the
pool
he
was
intending
to
make
his
death-bed
.
At
first
*NL*
it
was
indistinct
by
reason
of
the
shadow
from
the
bank
;
but
it
emerged
*NL*
thence
and
took
shape
,
which
was
that
of
a
human
body
,
lying
stiff
and
*NL*
stark
upon
the
surface
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
circular
current
imparted
by
the
central
flow
the
form
was
*NL*
brought
forward
,
till
it
passed
under
his
eyes
;
and
then
he
perceived
*NL*
with
a
sense
of
horror
that
it
was
HIMSELF
.
Not
a
man
somewhat
*NL*
resembling
him
,
but
one
in
all
respects
his
counterpart
,
his
actual
*NL*
double
,
was
floating
as
if
dead
in
Ten
Hatches
Hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sense
of
the
supernatural
was
strong
in
this
unhappy
man
,
and
*NL*
he
turned
away
as
one
might
have
done
in
the
actual
presence
of
an
*NL*
appalling
miracle
.
He
covered
his
eyes
and
bowed
his
head
.
Without
*NL*
looking
again
into
the
stream
he
took
his
coat
and
hat
,
and
went
slowly
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
found
himself
by
the
door
of
his
own
dwelling
.
To
his
*NL*
surprise
Elizabeth-Jane
was
standing
there
.
She
came
forward
,
spoke
,
*NL*
called
him
``
father
''
just
as
before
.
Newson
,
then
,
had
not
even
yet
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
seemed
very
sad
this
morning
,
''
she
said
,
``
so
I
have
come
*NL*
again
to
see
you
.
Not
that
I
am
anything
but
sad
myself
.
But
everybody
*NL*
and
everything
seem
against
you
so
,
and
I
know
you
must
be
suffering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
this
woman
divined
things
!
Yet
she
had
not
divined
their
whole
*NL*
extremity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
her
,
``
Are
miracles
still
worked
,
do
ye
think
,
Elizabeth
?
I
*NL*
am
not
a
read
man
.
I
do
n't
know
so
much
as
I
could
wish
.
I
have
tried
*NL*
to
peruse
and
learn
all
my
life
;
but
the
more
I
try
to
know
the
more
*NL*
ignorant
I
seem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
think
there
are
any
miracles
nowadays
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
interference
in
the
case
of
desperate
intentions
,
for
instance
?
*NL*
Well
,
perhaps
not
,
in
a
direct
way
.
Perhaps
not
.
But
will
you
come
and
*NL*
walk
with
me
,
and
I
will
show
`
ee
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
agreed
willingly
,
and
he
took
her
over
the
highway
,
and
by
the
*NL*
lonely
path
to
Ten
Hatches
.
He
walked
restlessly
,
as
if
some
haunting
*NL*
shade
,
unseen
of
her
,
hovered
round
him
and
troubled
his
glance
.
She
*NL*
would
gladly
have
talked
of
Lucetta
,
but
feared
to
disturb
him
.
When
*NL*
they
got
near
the
weir
he
stood
still
,
and
asked
her
to
go
forward
and
*NL*
look
into
the
pool
,
and
tell
him
what
she
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
,
and
soon
returned
to
him
.
``
Nothing
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
again
,
''
said
Henchard
,
``
and
look
narrowly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
proceeded
to
the
river
brink
a
second
time
.
On
her
return
,
after
*NL*
some
delay
,
she
told
him
that
she
saw
something
floating
round
and
round
*NL*
there
;
but
what
it
was
she
could
not
discern
.
It
seemed
to
be
a
bundle
*NL*
of
old
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
like
mine
?
''
asked
Henchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
they
are
.
Dear
me
--
I
wonder
if
--
Father
,
let
us
go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
look
once
more
;
and
then
we
will
get
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
back
,
and
he
could
see
her
stoop
till
her
head
was
close
to
the
*NL*
margin
of
the
pool
.
She
started
up
,
and
hastened
back
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Henchard
;
``
what
do
you
say
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
--
do
--
what
is
it
floating
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
effigy
,
''
she
answered
hastily
.
``
They
must
have
thrown
it
into
the
*NL*
river
higher
up
amongst
the
willows
at
Blackwater
,
to
get
rid
of
it
in
*NL*
their
alarm
at
discovery
by
the
magistrates
,
and
it
must
have
floated
*NL*
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
to
be
sure
--
the
image
o
'
me
!
But
where
is
the
other
?
Why
that
one
*NL*
only
?
...
That
performance
of
theirs
killed
her
,
but
kept
me
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
thought
and
thought
of
these
words
``
kept
me
alive
,
''
as
*NL*
they
slowly
retraced
their
way
to
the
town
,
and
at
length
guessed
their
*NL*
meaning
.
``
Father
!
--
I
will
not
leave
you
alone
like
this
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
``
May
I
live
with
you
,
and
tend
upon
you
as
I
used
to
do
?
I
do
not
mind
*NL*
your
being
poor
.
I
would
have
agreed
to
come
this
morning
,
but
you
did
*NL*
not
ask
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
you
come
to
me
?
''
he
cried
bitterly
.
``
Elizabeth
,
do
n't
mock
me
!
If
*NL*
you
only
would
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
you
forgive
all
my
roughness
in
former
days
?
You
can
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
forgotten
it
.
Talk
of
that
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
assured
him
,
and
arranged
their
plans
for
reunion
;
and
at
*NL*
length
each
went
home
.
Then
Henchard
shaved
for
the
first
time
during
*NL*
many
days
,
and
put
on
clean
linen
,
and
combed
his
hair
;
and
was
as
a
man
*NL*
resuscitated
thenceforward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
the
fact
turned
out
to
be
as
Elizabeth-Jane
had
stated
;
*NL*
the
effigy
was
discovered
by
a
cowherd
,
and
that
of
Lucetta
a
little
*NL*
higher
up
in
the
same
stream
.
But
as
little
as
possible
was
said
of
the
*NL*
matter
,
and
the
figures
were
privately
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
this
natural
solution
of
the
mystery
Henchard
no
less
regarded
*NL*
it
as
an
intervention
that
the
figure
should
have
been
floating
there
.
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
heard
him
say
,
``
Who
is
such
a
reprobate
as
I
!
And
yet
it
*NL*
seems
that
even
I
be
in
Somebody
's
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
42
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
emotional
conviction
that
he
was
in
Somebody
's
hand
began
to
die
*NL*
out
of
Henchard
's
breast
as
time
slowly
removed
into
distance
the
event
*NL*
which
had
given
that
feeling
birth
.
The
apparition
of
Newson
haunted
*NL*
him
.
He
would
surely
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Newson
did
not
arrive
.
Lucetta
had
been
borne
along
the
churchyard
*NL*
path
;
Casterbridge
had
for
the
last
time
turned
its
regard
upon
her
,
*NL*
before
proceeding
to
its
work
as
if
she
had
never
lived
.
But
Elizabeth
*NL*
remained
undisturbed
in
the
belief
of
her
relationship
to
Henchard
,
and
*NL*
now
shared
his
home
.
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
Newson
was
gone
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
time
the
bereaved
Farfrae
had
learnt
the
,
at
least
,
proximate
*NL*
cause
of
Lucetta
's
illness
and
death
,
and
his
first
impulse
was
*NL*
naturally
enough
to
wreak
vengeance
in
the
name
of
the
law
upon
the
*NL*
perpetrators
of
the
mischief
.
He
resolved
to
wait
till
the
funeral
was
*NL*
over
ere
he
moved
in
the
matter
.
The
time
having
come
he
reflected
.
*NL*
Disastrous
as
the
result
had
been
,
it
was
obviously
in
no
way
foreseen
*NL*
or
intended
by
the
thoughtless
crew
who
arranged
the
motley
procession
.
*NL*
The
tempting
prospect
of
putting
to
the
blush
people
who
stand
at
the
*NL*
head
of
affairs
--
that
supreme
and
piquant
enjoyment
of
those
who
writhe
*NL*
under
the
heel
of
the
same
--
had
alone
animated
them
,
so
far
as
he
could
*NL*
see
;
for
he
knew
nothing
of
Jopp
's
incitements
.
Other
considerations
*NL*
were
also
involved
.
Lucetta
had
confessed
everything
to
him
before
her
*NL*
death
,
and
it
was
not
altogether
desirable
to
make
much
ado
about
her
*NL*
history
,
alike
for
her
sake
,
for
Henchard
's
,
and
for
his
own
.
To
*NL*
regard
the
event
as
an
untoward
accident
seemed
,
to
Farfrae
,
truest
*NL*
consideration
for
the
dead
one
's
memory
,
as
well
as
best
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
and
himself
mutually
forbore
to
meet
.
For
Elizabeth
's
sake
the
*NL*
former
had
fettered
his
pride
sufficiently
to
accept
the
small
seed
and
*NL*
root
business
which
some
of
the
Town
Council
,
headed
by
Farfrae
,
had
*NL*
purchased
to
afford
him
a
new
opening
.
Had
he
been
only
personally
*NL*
concerned
Henchard
,
without
doubt
,
would
have
declined
assistance
even
*NL*
remotely
brought
about
by
the
man
whom
he
had
so
fiercely
assailed
.
But
*NL*
the
sympathy
of
the
girl
seemed
necessary
to
his
very
existence
;
and
on
*NL*
her
account
pride
itself
wore
the
garments
of
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
settled
themselves
;
and
on
each
day
of
their
lives
Henchard
*NL*
anticipated
her
every
wish
with
a
watchfulness
in
which
paternal
regard
*NL*
was
heightened
by
a
burning
jealous
dread
of
rivalry
.
Yet
that
Newson
*NL*
would
ever
now
return
to
Casterbridge
to
claim
her
as
a
daughter
there
*NL*
was
little
reason
to
suppose
.
He
was
a
wanderer
and
a
stranger
,
almost
*NL*
an
alien
;
he
had
not
seen
his
daughter
for
several
years
;
his
affection
*NL*
for
her
could
not
in
the
nature
of
things
be
keen
;
other
interests
would
*NL*
probably
soon
obscure
his
recollections
of
her
,
and
prevent
any
such
*NL*
renewal
of
inquiry
into
the
past
as
would
lead
to
a
discovery
that
she
*NL*
was
still
a
creature
of
the
present
.
To
satisfy
his
conscience
somewhat
*NL*
Henchard
repeated
to
himself
that
the
lie
which
had
retained
for
him
*NL*
the
coveted
treasure
had
not
been
deliberately
told
to
that
end
,
but
*NL*
had
come
from
him
as
the
last
defiant
word
of
a
despair
which
took
no
*NL*
thought
of
consequences
.
Furthermore
he
pleaded
within
himself
that
no
*NL*
Newson
could
love
her
as
he
loved
her
,
or
would
tend
her
to
his
life
's
*NL*
extremity
as
he
was
prepared
to
do
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
lived
on
in
the
shop
overlooking
the
churchyard
,
and
nothing
*NL*
occurred
to
mark
their
days
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
.
Going
out
*NL*
but
seldom
,
and
never
on
a
marketday
,
they
saw
Donald
Farfrae
only
at
*NL*
rarest
intervals
,
and
then
mostly
as
a
transitory
object
in
the
distance
*NL*
of
the
street
.
Yet
he
was
pursuing
his
ordinary
avocations
,
smiling
*NL*
mechanically
to
fellow-tradesmen
,
and
arguing
with
bargainers
--
as
*NL*
bereaved
men
do
after
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
,
``
in
his
own
grey
style
,
''
taught
Farfrae
how
to
estimate
his
*NL*
experience
of
Lucetta
--
all
that
it
was
,
and
all
that
it
was
not
.
There
*NL*
are
men
whose
hearts
insist
upon
a
dogged
fidelity
to
some
image
or
*NL*
cause
thrown
by
chance
into
their
keeping
,
long
after
their
judgment
has
*NL*
pronounced
it
no
rarity
--
even
the
reverse
,
indeed
,
and
without
them
the
*NL*
band
of
the
worthy
is
incomplete
.
But
Farfrae
was
not
of
those
.
It
*NL*
was
inevitable
that
the
insight
,
briskness
,
and
rapidity
of
his
nature
*NL*
should
take
him
out
of
the
dead
blank
which
his
loss
threw
about
him
.
He
*NL*
could
not
but
perceive
that
by
the
death
of
Lucetta
he
had
exchanged
*NL*
a
looming
misery
for
a
simple
sorrow
.
After
that
revelation
of
her
*NL*
history
,
which
must
have
come
sooner
or
later
in
any
circumstances
,
it
*NL*
was
hard
to
believe
that
life
with
her
would
have
been
productive
of
*NL*
further
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
a
memory
,
nothwithstanding
such
conditions
,
Lucetta
's
image
still
*NL*
lived
on
with
him
,
her
weaknesses
provoking
only
the
gentlest
criticism
,
*NL*
and
her
sufferings
attenuating
wrath
at
her
concealments
to
a
momentary
*NL*
spark
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
end
of
a
year
Henchard
's
little
retail
seed
and
grain
shop
,
not
*NL*
much
larger
than
a
cupboard
,
had
developed
its
trade
considerably
,
and
*NL*
the
stepfather
and
daughter
enjoyed
much
serenity
in
the
pleasant
,
sunny
*NL*
corner
in
which
it
stood
.
The
quiet
bearing
of
one
who
brimmed
with
an
*NL*
inner
activity
characterized
Elizabeth-Jane
at
this
period
.
She
took
*NL*
long
walks
into
the
country
two
or
three
times
a
week
,
mostly
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Budmouth
.
Sometimes
it
occurred
to
him
that
when
she
sat
*NL*
with
him
in
the
evening
after
those
invigorating
walks
she
was
civil
*NL*
rather
than
affectionate
;
and
he
was
troubled
;
one
more
bitter
regret
*NL*
being
added
to
those
he
had
already
experienced
at
having
,
by
his
severe
*NL*
censorship
,
frozen
up
her
precious
affection
when
originally
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
own
way
in
everything
now
.
In
going
and
coming
,
in
buying
*NL*
and
selling
,
her
word
was
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
got
a
new
muff
,
Elizabeth
,
''
he
said
to
her
one
day
quite
*NL*
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
bought
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
it
again
as
it
lay
on
an
adjoining
table
.
The
fur
was
of
a
*NL*
glossy
brown
,
and
,
though
he
was
no
judge
of
such
articles
,
he
thought
*NL*
it
seemed
an
unusually
good
one
for
her
to
possess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
costly
,
I
suppose
,
my
dear
,
was
it
not
?
''
he
hazarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
rather
above
my
figure
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
``
But
it
is
not
*NL*
showy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
''
said
the
netted
lion
,
anxious
not
to
pique
her
in
the
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
little
time
after
,
when
the
year
had
advanced
into
another
spring
,
*NL*
he
paused
opposite
her
empty
bedroom
in
passing
it
.
He
thought
of
the
*NL*
time
when
she
had
cleared
out
of
his
then
large
and
handsome
house
in
*NL*
Corn
Street
,
in
consequence
of
his
dislike
and
harshness
,
and
he
had
*NL*
looked
into
her
chamber
in
just
the
same
way
.
The
present
room
was
much
*NL*
humbler
,
but
what
struck
him
about
it
was
the
abundance
of
books
lying
*NL*
everywhere
.
Their
number
and
quality
made
the
meagre
furniture
that
*NL*
supported
them
seem
absurdly
disproportionate
.
Some
,
indeed
many
,
must
*NL*
have
been
recently
purchased
;
and
though
he
encouraged
her
to
buy
*NL*
in
reason
,
he
had
no
notion
that
she
indulged
her
innate
passion
so
*NL*
extensively
in
proportion
to
the
narrowness
of
their
income
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
he
felt
a
little
hurt
by
what
he
thought
her
extravagance
,
*NL*
and
resolved
to
say
a
word
to
her
about
it
.
But
,
before
he
had
found
*NL*
the
courage
to
speak
an
event
happened
which
set
his
thoughts
flying
in
*NL*
quite
another
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
busy
time
of
the
seed
trade
was
over
,
and
the
quiet
weeks
that
*NL*
preceded
the
hay-season
had
come
--
setting
their
special
stamp
upon
*NL*
Casterbridge
by
thronging
the
market
with
wood
rakes
,
new
waggons
in
*NL*
yellow
,
green
,
and
red
,
formidable
scythes
,
and
pitchforks
of
prong
*NL*
sufficient
to
skewer
up
a
small
family
.
Henchard
,
contrary
to
his
wont
,
*NL*
went
out
one
Saturday
afternoon
towards
the
market-place
from
a
curious
*NL*
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
pass
a
few
minutes
on
the
spot
of
his
*NL*
former
triumphs
.
Farfrae
,
to
whom
he
was
still
a
comparative
stranger
,
*NL*
stood
a
few
steps
below
the
Corn
Exchange
door
--
a
usual
position
with
*NL*
him
at
this
hour
--
and
he
appeared
lost
in
thought
about
something
he
was
*NL*
looking
at
a
little
way
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
eyes
followed
Farfrae
's
,
and
he
saw
that
the
object
of
his
*NL*
gaze
was
no
sample-showing
farmer
,
but
his
own
stepdaughter
,
who
had
*NL*
just
come
out
of
a
shop
over
the
way
.
She
,
on
her
part
,
was
quite
*NL*
unconscious
of
his
attention
,
and
in
this
was
less
fortunate
than
those
*NL*
young
women
whose
very
plumes
,
like
those
of
Juno
's
bird
,
are
set
with
*NL*
Argus
eyes
whenever
possible
admirers
are
within
ken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
went
away
,
thinking
that
perhaps
there
was
nothing
significant
*NL*
after
all
in
Farfrae
's
look
at
Elizabeth-Jane
at
that
juncture
.
Yet
he
*NL*
could
not
forget
that
the
Scotchman
had
once
shown
a
tender
interest
*NL*
in
her
,
of
a
fleeting
kind
.
Thereupon
promptly
came
to
the
surface
*NL*
that
idiosyncrasy
of
Henchard
's
which
had
ruled
his
courses
from
the
*NL*
beginning
and
had
mainly
made
him
what
he
was
.
Instead
of
thinking
that
*NL*
a
union
between
his
cherished
step-daughter
and
the
energetic
thriving
*NL*
Donald
was
a
thing
to
be
desired
for
her
good
and
his
own
,
he
hated
the
*NL*
very
possibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
had
been
when
such
instinctive
opposition
would
have
taken
shape
*NL*
in
action
.
But
he
was
not
now
the
Henchard
of
former
days
.
He
schooled
*NL*
himself
to
accept
her
will
,
in
this
as
in
other
matters
,
as
absolute
and
*NL*
unquestionable
.
He
dreaded
lest
an
antagonistic
word
should
lose
for
him
*NL*
such
regard
as
he
had
regained
from
her
by
his
devotion
,
feeling
that
*NL*
to
retain
this
under
separation
was
better
than
to
incur
her
dislike
by
*NL*
keeping
her
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
mere
thought
of
such
separation
fevered
his
spirit
much
,
and
in
*NL*
the
evening
he
said
,
with
the
stillness
of
suspense
:
``
Have
you
seen
Mr.
*NL*
Farfrae
to-day
,
Elizabeth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
started
at
the
question
;
and
it
was
with
some
confusion
*NL*
that
she
replied
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
that
's
right
--
that
's
right
...
It
was
only
that
I
saw
him
in
the
*NL*
street
when
we
both
were
there
.
''
He
was
wondering
if
her
embarrassment
*NL*
justified
him
in
a
new
suspicion
--
that
the
long
walks
which
she
had
*NL*
latterly
been
taking
,
that
the
new
books
which
had
so
surprised
him
,
had
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
the
young
man
.
She
did
not
enlighten
him
,
and
lest
*NL*
silence
should
allow
her
to
shape
thoughts
unfavourable
to
their
present
*NL*
friendly
relations
,
he
diverted
the
discourse
into
another
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
was
,
by
original
make
,
the
last
man
to
act
stealthily
,
for
good
*NL*
or
for
evil
.
But
the
solicitus
timor
of
his
love
--
the
dependence
upon
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
regard
into
which
he
had
declined
-LRB-
or
,
in
another
sense
,
*NL*
to
which
he
had
advanced
-RRB-
--
denaturalized
him
.
He
would
often
weigh
*NL*
and
consider
for
hours
together
the
meaning
of
such
and
such
a
deed
or
*NL*
phrase
of
hers
,
when
a
blunt
settling
question
would
formerly
have
been
*NL*
his
first
instinct
.
And
now
,
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
a
passion
for
*NL*
Farfrae
which
should
entirely
displace
her
mild
filial
sympathy
with
*NL*
himself
,
he
observed
her
going
and
coming
more
narrowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
secret
in
Elizabeth-Jane
's
movements
beyond
what
*NL*
habitual
reserve
induced
,
and
it
may
at
once
be
owned
on
her
account
*NL*
that
she
was
guilty
of
occasional
conversations
with
Donald
when
they
*NL*
chanced
to
meet
.
Whatever
the
origin
of
her
walks
on
the
Budmouth
*NL*
Road
,
her
return
from
those
walks
was
often
coincident
with
Farfrae
's
*NL*
emergence
from
Corn
Street
for
a
twenty
minutes
'
blow
on
that
rather
*NL*
windy
highway
--
just
to
winnow
the
seeds
and
chaff
out
of
him
before
*NL*
sitting
down
to
tea
,
as
he
said
.
Henchard
became
aware
of
this
by
going
*NL*
to
the
Ring
,
and
,
screened
by
its
enclosure
,
keeping
his
eye
upon
the
*NL*
road
till
he
saw
them
meet
.
His
face
assumed
an
expression
of
extreme
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
her
,
too
,
he
means
to
rob
me
!
''
he
whispered
.
``
But
he
has
the
right
.
*NL*
I
do
not
wish
to
interfere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
,
in
truth
,
was
of
a
very
innocent
kind
,
and
matters
were
by
*NL*
no
means
so
far
advanced
between
the
young
people
as
Henchard
's
jealous
*NL*
grief
inferred
.
Could
he
have
heard
such
conversation
as
passed
he
would
*NL*
have
been
enlightened
thus
much
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
HE
.
--
``
You
like
walking
this
way
,
Miss
Henchard
--
and
is
it
not
so
?
''
*NL*
-LRB-
uttered
in
his
undulatory
accents
,
and
with
an
appraising
,
pondering
*NL*
gaze
at
her
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
.
--
``
O
yes
.
I
have
chosen
this
road
latterly
.
I
have
no
great
reason
*NL*
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
HE
.
--
``
But
that
may
make
a
reason
for
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
-LRB-
reddening
-RRB-
.
--
``
I
do
n't
know
that
.
My
reason
,
however
,
such
as
it
is
,
*NL*
is
that
I
wish
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
HE
.
--
``
Is
it
a
secret
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
-LRB-
reluctantly
-RRB-
.
--
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
HE
-LRB-
with
the
pathos
of
one
of
his
native
ballads
-RRB-
.
--
``
Ah
,
I
doubt
there
*NL*
will
be
any
good
in
secrets
!
A
secret
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
my
life
.
*NL*
And
well
you
know
what
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
admitted
that
she
did
,
but
she
refrained
from
confessing
why
*NL*
the
sea
attracted
her
.
She
could
not
herself
account
for
it
fully
,
not
*NL*
knowing
the
secret
possibly
to
be
that
,
in
addition
to
early
marine
*NL*
associations
,
her
blood
was
a
sailor
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
those
new
books
,
Mr.
Farfrae
,
''
she
added
shyly
.
``
I
wonder
*NL*
if
I
ought
to
accept
so
many
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
why
not
?
It
gives
me
more
pleasure
to
get
them
for
you
,
than
you
to
*NL*
have
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
proceeded
along
the
road
together
till
they
reached
the
town
,
and
*NL*
their
paths
diverged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
vowed
that
he
would
leave
them
to
their
own
devices
,
put
*NL*
nothing
in
the
way
of
their
courses
,
whatever
they
might
mean
.
If
he
*NL*
were
doomed
to
be
bereft
of
her
,
so
it
must
be
.
In
the
situation
which
*NL*
their
marriage
would
create
he
could
see
no
locus
standi
for
himself
*NL*
at
all
.
Farfrae
would
never
recognize
him
more
than
superciliously
;
his
*NL*
poverty
ensured
that
,
no
less
than
his
past
conduct
.
And
so
Elizabeth
*NL*
would
grow
to
be
a
stranger
to
him
,
and
the
end
of
his
life
would
be
*NL*
friendless
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
possibility
impending
he
could
not
help
watchfulness
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
within
certain
lines
,
he
had
the
right
to
keep
an
eye
upon
her
*NL*
as
his
charge
.
The
meetings
seemed
to
become
matters
of
course
with
them
*NL*
on
special
days
of
the
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
full
proof
was
given
him
.
He
was
standing
behind
a
wall
close
*NL*
to
the
place
at
which
Farfrae
encountered
her
.
He
heard
the
young
man
*NL*
address
her
as
``
Dearest
Elizabeth-Jane
,
''
and
then
kiss
her
,
the
girl
*NL*
looking
quickly
round
to
assure
herself
that
nobody
was
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
gone
their
way
Henchard
came
out
from
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
mournfully
followed
them
to
Casterbridge
.
The
chief
looming
trouble
*NL*
in
this
engagement
had
not
decreased
.
Both
Farfrae
and
Elizabeth-Jane
,
*NL*
unlike
the
rest
of
the
people
,
must
suppose
Elizabeth
to
be
his
actual
*NL*
daughter
,
from
his
own
assertion
while
he
himself
had
the
same
belief
;
*NL*
and
though
Farfrae
must
have
so
far
forgiven
him
as
to
have
no
objection
*NL*
to
own
him
as
a
father-in-law
,
intimate
they
could
never
be
.
Thus
would
*NL*
the
girl
,
who
was
his
only
friend
,
be
withdrawn
from
him
by
degrees
*NL*
through
her
husband
's
influence
,
and
learn
to
despise
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
she
lost
her
heart
to
any
other
man
in
the
world
than
the
one
he
had
*NL*
rivalled
,
cursed
,
wrestled
with
for
life
in
days
before
his
spirit
was
*NL*
broken
,
Henchard
would
have
said
,
``
I
am
content
.
''
But
content
with
the
*NL*
prospect
as
now
depicted
was
hard
to
acquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
an
outer
chamber
of
the
brain
in
which
thoughts
unowned
,
*NL*
unsolicited
,
and
of
noxious
kind
,
are
sometimes
allowed
to
wander
for
a
*NL*
moment
prior
to
being
sent
off
whence
they
came
.
One
of
these
thoughts
*NL*
sailed
into
Henchard
's
ken
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suppose
he
were
to
communicate
to
Farfrae
the
fact
that
his
betrothed
*NL*
was
not
the
child
of
Michael
Henchard
at
all
--
legally
,
nobody
's
child
;
*NL*
how
would
that
correct
and
leading
townsman
receive
the
information
?
*NL*
He
might
possibly
forsake
Elizabeth-Jane
,
and
then
she
would
be
her
*NL*
step-sire
's
own
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
shuddered
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
God
forbid
such
a
thing
!
Why
should
*NL*
I
still
be
subject
to
these
visitations
of
the
devil
,
when
I
try
so
hard
*NL*
to
keep
him
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
43
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
Henchard
saw
thus
early
was
,
naturally
enough
,
seen
at
a
little
*NL*
later
date
by
other
people
.
That
Mr.
Farfrae
``
walked
with
that
bankrupt
*NL*
Henchard
's
step-daughter
,
of
all
women
,
''
became
a
common
topic
in
the
*NL*
town
,
the
simple
perambulating
term
being
used
hereabout
to
signify
a
*NL*
wooing
;
and
the
nineteen
superior
young
ladies
of
Casterbridge
,
who
*NL*
had
each
looked
upon
herself
as
the
only
woman
capable
of
making
the
*NL*
merchant
Councilman
happy
,
indignantly
left
off
going
to
the
church
*NL*
Farfrae
attended
,
left
off
conscious
mannerisms
,
left
off
putting
him
in
*NL*
their
prayers
at
night
amongst
their
blood
relations
;
in
short
,
reverted
*NL*
to
their
normal
courses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
only
inhabitants
of
the
town
to
whom
this
looming
choice
*NL*
of
the
Scotchman
's
gave
unmixed
satisfaction
were
the
members
of
the
*NL*
philosophic
party
,
which
included
Longways
,
Christopher
Coney
,
Billy
*NL*
Wills
,
Mr.
Buzzford
,
and
the
like
.
The
Three
Mariners
having
been
,
years
*NL*
before
,
the
house
in
which
they
had
witnessed
the
young
man
and
woman
's
*NL*
first
and
humble
appearance
on
the
Casterbridge
stage
,
they
took
a
*NL*
kindly
interest
in
their
career
,
not
unconnected
,
perhaps
,
with
visions
*NL*
of
festive
treatment
at
their
hands
hereafter
.
Mrs.
Stannidge
,
having
*NL*
rolled
into
the
large
parlour
one
evening
and
said
that
it
was
a
wonder
*NL*
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Farfrae
,
``
a
pillow
of
the
town
,
''
who
might
have
chosen
*NL*
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
professional
men
or
private
residents
,
*NL*
should
stoop
so
low
,
Coney
ventured
to
disagree
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
no
wonder
at
all
.
'T
is
she
that
's
a
stooping
to
he
--
that
's
*NL*
my
opinion
.
A
widow
man
--
whose
first
wife
was
no
credit
to
him
--
what
is
*NL*
it
for
a
young
perusing
woman
that
's
her
own
mistress
and
well
liked
?
*NL*
But
as
a
neat
patching
up
of
things
I
see
much
good
in
it
.
When
a
man
*NL*
have
put
up
a
tomb
of
best
marble-stone
to
the
other
one
,
as
he
've
*NL*
done
,
and
weeped
his
fill
,
and
thought
it
all
over
,
and
said
to
hisself
,
*NL*
`
T'other
took
me
in
,
I
knowed
this
one
first
;
she
's
a
sensible
piece
for
*NL*
a
partner
,
and
there
's
no
faithful
woman
in
high
life
now
'
;
--
well
,
he
*NL*
may
do
worse
than
not
to
take
her
,
if
she
's
tender-inclined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
talked
at
the
Mariners
.
But
we
must
guard
against
a
too
*NL*
liberal
use
of
the
conventional
declaration
that
a
great
sensation
was
*NL*
caused
by
the
prospective
event
,
that
all
the
gossips
'
tongues
were
set
*NL*
wagging
thereby
,
and
so-on
,
even
though
such
a
declaration
might
lend
*NL*
some
eclat
to
the
career
of
our
poor
only
heroine
.
When
all
has
been
*NL*
said
about
busy
rumourers
,
a
superficial
and
temporary
thing
is
the
*NL*
interest
of
anybody
in
affairs
which
do
not
directly
touch
them
.
It
*NL*
would
be
a
truer
representation
to
say
that
Casterbridge
-LRB-
ever
excepting
*NL*
the
nineteen
young
ladies
-RRB-
looked
up
for
a
moment
at
the
news
,
and
*NL*
withdrawing
its
attention
,
went
on
labouring
and
victualling
,
bringing
*NL*
up
its
children
,
and
burying
its
dead
,
without
caring
a
tittle
for
*NL*
Farfrae
's
domestic
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
hint
of
the
matter
was
thrown
out
to
her
stepfather
by
Elizabeth
*NL*
herself
or
by
Farfrae
either
.
Reasoning
on
the
cause
of
their
reticence
*NL*
he
concluded
that
,
estimating
him
by
his
past
,
the
throbbing
pair
were
*NL*
afraid
to
broach
the
subject
,
and
looked
upon
him
as
an
irksome
obstacle
*NL*
whom
they
would
be
heartily
glad
to
get
out
of
the
way
.
Embittered
as
he
*NL*
was
against
society
,
this
moody
view
of
himself
took
deeper
and
deeper
*NL*
hold
of
Henchard
,
till
the
daily
necessity
of
facing
mankind
,
and
of
*NL*
them
particularly
Elizabeth-Jane
,
became
well-nigh
more
than
he
could
*NL*
endure
.
His
health
declined
;
he
became
morbidly
sensitive
.
He
wished
he
*NL*
could
escape
those
who
did
not
want
him
,
and
hide
his
head
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
if
he
were
mistaken
in
his
views
,
and
there
were
no
necessity
*NL*
that
his
own
absolute
separation
from
her
should
be
involved
in
the
*NL*
incident
of
her
marriage
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
proceeded
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
alternative
--
himself
living
like
a
*NL*
fangless
lion
about
the
back
rooms
of
a
house
in
which
his
stepdaughter
*NL*
was
mistress
,
an
inoffensive
old
man
,
tenderly
smiled
on
by
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
and
good-naturedly
tolerated
by
her
husband
.
It
was
terrible
to
his
*NL*
pride
to
think
of
descending
so
low
;
and
yet
,
for
the
girl
's
sake
*NL*
he
might
put
up
with
anything
;
even
from
Farfrae
;
even
snubbings
and
*NL*
masterful
tongue-scourgings
.
The
privilege
of
being
in
the
house
she
*NL*
occupied
would
almost
outweigh
the
personal
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
were
a
dim
possibility
or
the
reverse
,
the
courtship
--
which
*NL*
it
evidently
now
was
--
had
an
absorbing
interest
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
as
has
been
said
,
often
took
her
walks
on
the
Budmouth
Road
,
*NL*
and
Farfrae
as
often
made
it
convenient
to
create
an
accidental
meeting
*NL*
with
her
there
.
Two
miles
out
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
highway
,
*NL*
was
the
prehistoric
fort
called
Mai
Dun
,
of
huge
dimensions
and
many
*NL*
ramparts
,
within
or
upon
whose
enclosures
a
human
being
as
seen
from
*NL*
the
road
,
was
but
an
insignificant
speck
.
Hitherward
Henchard
often
*NL*
resorted
,
glass
in
hand
,
and
scanned
the
hedgeless
Via
--
for
it
was
the
*NL*
original
track
laid
out
by
the
legions
of
the
Empire
--
to
a
distance
of
*NL*
two
or
three
miles
,
his
object
being
to
read
the
progress
of
affairs
*NL*
between
Farfrae
and
his
charmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Henchard
was
at
this
spot
when
a
masculine
figure
came
along
*NL*
the
road
from
Budmouth
,
and
lingered
.
Applying
his
telescope
to
his
eye
*NL*
Henchard
expected
that
Farfrae
's
features
would
be
disclosed
as
usual
.
*NL*
But
the
lenses
revealed
that
today
the
man
was
not
Elizabeth-Jane
's
*NL*
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
clothed
as
a
merchant
captain
,
and
as
he
turned
in
the
*NL*
scrutiny
of
the
road
he
revealed
his
face
.
Henchard
lived
a
lifetime
the
*NL*
moment
he
saw
it
.
The
face
was
Newson
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
dropped
the
glass
,
and
for
some
seconds
made
no
other
movement
.
*NL*
Newson
waited
,
and
Henchard
waited
--
if
that
could
be
called
a
waiting
*NL*
which
was
a
transfixture
.
But
Elizabeth-Jane
did
not
come
.
Something
*NL*
or
other
had
caused
her
to
neglect
her
customary
walk
that
day
.
Perhaps
*NL*
Farfrae
and
she
had
chosen
another
road
for
variety
's
sake
.
But
what
did
*NL*
that
amount
to
?
She
might
be
here
to-morrow
,
and
in
any
case
Newson
,
if
*NL*
bent
on
a
private
meeting
and
a
revelation
of
the
truth
to
her
,
would
*NL*
soon
make
his
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
would
tell
her
not
only
of
his
paternity
,
but
of
the
ruse
by
*NL*
which
he
had
been
once
sent
away
.
Elizabeth
's
strict
nature
would
cause
*NL*
her
for
the
first
time
to
despise
her
stepfather
,
would
root
out
his
*NL*
image
as
that
of
an
arch-deceiver
,
and
Newson
would
reign
in
her
heart
*NL*
in
his
stead
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Newson
did
not
see
anything
of
her
that
morning
.
Having
stood
still
*NL*
awhile
he
at
last
retraced
his
steps
,
and
Henchard
felt
like
a
condemned
*NL*
man
who
has
a
few
hours
'
respite
.
When
he
reached
his
own
house
he
found
*NL*
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
father
!
''
she
said
innocently
.
``
I
have
had
a
letter
--
a
strange
*NL*
one
--
not
signed
.
Somebody
has
asked
me
to
meet
him
,
either
on
the
*NL*
Budmouth
Road
at
noon
today
,
or
in
the
evening
at
Mr.
Farfrae
's
.
He
says
*NL*
he
came
to
see
me
some
time
ago
,
but
a
trick
was
played
him
,
so
that
he
*NL*
did
not
see
me
.
I
do
n't
understand
it
;
but
between
you
and
me
I
think
*NL*
Donald
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
,
and
that
it
is
a
relation
of
*NL*
his
who
wants
to
pass
an
opinion
on
his
choice
.
But
I
did
not
like
to
go
*NL*
till
I
had
seen
you
.
Shall
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
replied
heavily
,
``
Yes
;
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
of
his
remaining
in
Casterbridge
was
for
ever
disposed
of
*NL*
by
this
closing
in
of
Newson
on
the
scene
.
Henchard
was
not
the
man
to
*NL*
stand
the
certainty
of
condemnation
on
a
matter
so
near
his
heart
.
And
*NL*
being
an
old
hand
at
bearing
anguish
in
silence
,
and
haughty
withal
,
*NL*
he
resolved
to
make
as
light
as
he
could
of
his
intentions
,
while
*NL*
immediately
taking
his
measures
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
surprised
the
young
woman
whom
he
had
looked
upon
as
his
all
in
this
*NL*
world
by
saying
to
her
,
as
if
he
did
not
care
about
her
more
:
``
I
am
*NL*
going
to
leave
Casterbridge
,
Elizabeth-Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
Casterbridge
!
''
she
cried
,
``
and
leave
--
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
this
little
shop
can
be
managed
by
you
alone
as
well
as
by
us
*NL*
both
;
I
do
n't
care
about
shops
and
streets
and
folk
--
I
would
rather
get
*NL*
into
the
country
by
myself
,
out
of
sight
,
and
follow
my
own
ways
,
and
*NL*
leave
you
to
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
down
and
her
tears
fell
silently
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
this
*NL*
resolve
of
his
had
come
on
account
of
her
attachment
and
its
probable
*NL*
result
.
She
showed
her
devotion
to
Farfrae
,
however
,
by
mastering
her
*NL*
emotion
and
speaking
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
you
have
decided
on
this
,
''
she
said
with
difficult
firmness
.
*NL*
``
For
I
thought
it
probable
--
possible
--
that
I
might
marry
Mr.
Farfrae
*NL*
some
little
time
hence
,
and
I
did
not
know
that
you
disapproved
of
the
*NL*
step
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
approve
of
anything
you
desire
to
do
,
Izzy
,
''
said
Henchard
huskily
.
*NL*
``
If
I
did
not
approve
it
would
be
no
matter
!
I
wish
to
go
away
.
My
*NL*
presence
might
make
things
awkward
in
the
future
,
and
,
in
short
,
it
is
*NL*
best
that
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
that
her
affection
could
urge
would
induce
him
to
reconsider
his
*NL*
determination
;
for
she
could
not
urge
what
she
did
not
know
--
that
when
*NL*
she
should
learn
he
was
not
related
to
her
other
than
as
a
step-parent
*NL*
she
would
refrain
from
despising
him
,
and
that
when
she
knew
what
he
had
*NL*
done
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
she
would
refrain
from
hating
him
.
It
was
*NL*
his
conviction
that
she
would
not
so
refrain
;
and
there
existed
as
yet
*NL*
neither
word
nor
event
which
could
argue
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
you
will
not
be
able
to
come
to
my
wedding
;
*NL*
and
that
is
not
as
it
ought
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
see
it
--
I
do
n't
want
to
see
it
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
adding
*NL*
more
softly
,
``
but
think
of
me
sometimes
in
your
future
life
--
you
'll
do
*NL*
that
,
Izzy
?
--
think
of
me
when
you
are
living
as
the
wife
of
the
richest
,
*NL*
the
foremost
man
in
the
town
,
and
do
n't
let
my
sins
,
WHEN
YOU
KNOW
THEM
*NL*
ALL
,
cause
`
ee
to
quite
forget
that
though
I
loved
`
ee
late
I
loved
`
ee
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
because
of
Donald
!
''
she
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
forbid
you
to
marry
him
,
''
said
Henchard
.
``
Promise
not
to
quite
*NL*
forget
me
when
--
''
He
meant
when
Newson
should
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
promised
mechanically
,
in
her
agitation
;
and
the
same
evening
at
*NL*
dusk
Henchard
left
the
town
,
to
whose
development
he
had
been
one
of
*NL*
the
chief
stimulants
for
many
years
.
During
the
day
he
had
bought
a
new
*NL*
tool-basket
,
cleaned
up
his
old
hay-knife
and
wimble
,
set
himself
up
in
*NL*
fresh
leggings
,
kneenaps
and
corduroys
,
and
in
other
ways
gone
back
*NL*
to
the
working
clothes
of
his
young
manhood
,
discarding
for
ever
the
*NL*
shabby-genteel
suit
of
cloth
and
rusty
silk
hat
that
since
his
decline
*NL*
had
characterized
him
in
the
Casterbridge
street
as
a
man
who
had
seen
*NL*
better
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
secretly
and
alone
,
not
a
soul
of
the
many
who
had
known
him
*NL*
being
aware
of
his
departure
.
Elizabeth-Jane
accompanied
him
as
far
as
*NL*
the
second
bridge
on
the
highway
--
for
the
hour
of
her
appointment
with
*NL*
the
unguessed
visitor
at
Farfrae
's
had
not
yet
arrived
--
and
parted
from
*NL*
him
with
unfeigned
wonder
and
sorrow
,
keeping
him
back
a
minute
or
two
*NL*
before
finally
letting
him
go
.
She
watched
his
form
diminish
across
the
*NL*
moor
,
the
yellow
rush-basket
at
his
back
moving
up
and
down
with
each
*NL*
tread
,
and
the
creases
behind
his
knees
coming
and
going
alternately
*NL*
till
she
could
no
longer
see
them
.
Though
she
did
not
know
it
Henchard
*NL*
formed
at
this
moment
much
the
same
picture
as
he
had
presented
when
*NL*
entering
Casterbridge
for
the
first
time
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
*NL*
before
;
except
,
to
be
sure
,
that
the
serious
addition
to
his
years
*NL*
had
considerably
lessened
the
spring
to
his
stride
,
that
his
state
*NL*
of
hopelessness
had
weakened
him
,
and
imparted
to
his
shoulders
,
as
*NL*
weighted
by
the
basket
,
a
perceptible
bend
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
till
he
came
to
the
first
milestone
,
which
stood
in
the
bank
,
*NL*
half
way
up
a
steep
hill
.
He
rested
his
basket
on
the
top
of
the
stone
,
*NL*
placed
his
elbows
on
it
,
and
gave
way
to
a
convulsive
twitch
,
which
was
*NL*
worse
than
a
sob
,
because
it
was
so
hard
and
so
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
only
got
her
with
me
--
if
I
only
had
!
''
he
said
.
``
Hard
work
*NL*
would
be
nothing
to
me
then
!
But
that
was
not
to
be
.
I
--
Cain
--
go
alone
*NL*
as
I
deserve
--
an
outcast
and
a
vagabond
.
But
my
punishment
is
not
*NL*
greater
than
I
can
bear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sternly
subdued
his
anguish
,
shouldered
his
basket
,
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
in
the
meantime
,
had
breathed
him
a
sigh
,
recovered
her
*NL*
equanimity
,
and
turned
her
face
to
Casterbridge
.
Before
she
had
reached
*NL*
the
first
house
she
was
met
in
her
walk
by
Donald
Farfrae
.
This
was
*NL*
evidently
not
their
first
meeting
that
day
;
they
joined
hands
without
*NL*
ceremony
,
and
Farfrae
anxiously
asked
,
``
And
is
he
gone
--
and
did
you
tell
*NL*
him
?
--
I
mean
of
the
other
matter
--
not
of
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
gone
;
and
I
told
him
all
I
knew
of
your
friend
.
Donald
,
who
is
*NL*
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
dearie
;
you
will
know
soon
about
that
.
And
Mr.
Henchard
*NL*
will
hear
of
it
if
he
does
not
go
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
go
far
--
he
's
bent
upon
getting
out
of
sight
and
sound
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
beside
her
lover
,
and
when
they
reached
the
Crossways
,
or
*NL*
Bow
,
turned
with
him
into
Corn
Street
instead
of
going
straight
on
to
*NL*
her
own
door
.
At
Farfrae
's
house
they
stopped
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farfrae
flung
open
the
door
of
the
ground-floor
sitting-room
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
There
he
is
waiting
for
you
,
''
and
Elizabeth
entered
.
In
the
arm-chair
*NL*
sat
the
broad-faced
genial
man
who
had
called
on
Henchard
on
a
memorable
*NL*
morning
between
one
and
two
years
before
this
time
,
and
whom
the
latter
*NL*
had
seen
mount
the
coach
and
depart
within
half-an-hour
of
his
arrival
.
*NL*
It
was
Richard
Newson
.
The
meeting
with
the
light-hearted
father
from
*NL*
whom
she
had
been
separated
half-a-dozen
years
,
as
if
by
death
,
need
*NL*
hardly
be
detailed
.
It
was
an
affecting
one
,
apart
from
the
question
of
*NL*
paternity
.
Henchard
's
departure
was
in
a
moment
explained
.
When
the
*NL*
true
facts
came
to
be
handled
the
difficulty
of
restoring
her
to
her
*NL*
old
belief
in
Newson
was
not
so
great
as
might
have
seemed
likely
,
*NL*
for
Henchard
's
conduct
itself
was
a
proof
that
those
facts
were
true
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
she
had
grown
up
under
Newson
's
paternal
care
;
and
even
had
*NL*
Henchard
been
her
father
in
nature
,
this
father
in
early
domiciliation
*NL*
might
almost
have
carried
the
point
against
him
,
when
the
incidents
of
*NL*
her
parting
with
Henchard
had
a
little
worn
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newson
's
pride
in
what
she
had
grown
up
to
be
was
more
than
he
could
*NL*
express
.
He
kissed
her
again
and
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
saved
you
the
trouble
to
come
and
meet
me
--
ha-ha
!
''
said
Newson
.
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
that
Mr.
Farfrae
here
,
he
said
,
`
Come
up
and
stop
with
me
*NL*
for
a
day
or
two
,
Captain
Newson
,
and
I
'll
bring
her
round
.
'
`
Faith
,
'
*NL*
says
I
,
`
so
I
will
'
;
and
here
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Henchard
is
gone
,
''
said
Farfrae
,
shutting
the
door
.
``
He
has
done
*NL*
it
all
voluntarily
,
and
,
as
I
gather
from
Elizabeth
,
he
has
been
very
*NL*
nice
with
her
.
I
was
got
rather
uneasy
;
but
all
is
as
it
should
be
,
and
*NL*
we
will
have
no
more
deefficulties
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
that
's
very
much
as
I
thought
,
''
said
Newson
,
looking
into
the
face
*NL*
of
each
by
turns
.
``
I
said
to
myself
,
ay
,
a
hundred
times
,
when
I
tried
*NL*
to
get
a
peep
at
her
unknown
to
herself
--
`
Depend
upon
it
,
't
is
best
that
*NL*
I
should
live
on
quiet
for
a
few
days
like
this
till
something
turns
up
*NL*
for
the
better
.
'
I
now
know
you
are
all
right
,
and
what
can
I
wish
for
*NL*
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Captain
Newson
,
I
will
be
glad
to
see
ye
here
every
day
now
,
*NL*
since
it
can
do
no
harm
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
``
And
what
I
've
been
thinking
is
*NL*
that
the
wedding
may
as
well
be
kept
under
my
own
roof
,
the
house
being
*NL*
large
,
and
you
being
in
lodgings
by
yourself
--
so
that
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
and
expense
would
be
saved
ye
?
--
and
't
is
a
convenience
when
a
*NL*
couple
's
married
not
to
hae
far
to
go
to
get
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
Captain
Newson
;
``
since
,
as
ye
say
,
it
can
*NL*
do
no
harm
,
now
poor
Henchard
's
gone
;
though
I
would
n't
have
done
it
*NL*
otherwise
,
or
put
myself
in
his
way
at
all
;
for
I
've
already
in
my
*NL*
lifetime
been
an
intruder
into
his
family
quite
as
far
as
politeness
*NL*
can
be
expected
to
put
up
with
.
But
what
do
the
young
woman
say
herself
*NL*
about
it
?
Elizabeth
,
my
child
,
come
and
hearken
to
what
we
be
talking
*NL*
about
,
and
not
bide
staring
out
o
'
the
window
as
if
ye
did
n't
hear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Donald
and
you
must
settle
it
,
''
murmured
Elizabeth
,
still
keeping
up
a
*NL*
scrutinizing
gaze
at
some
small
object
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
continued
Newson
,
turning
anew
to
Farfrae
with
a
face
*NL*
expressing
thorough
entry
into
the
subject
,
``
that
's
how
we
'll
have
it
.
*NL*
And
,
Mr.
Farfrae
,
as
you
provide
so
much
,
and
houseroom
,
and
all
*NL*
that
,
I
'll
do
my
part
in
the
drinkables
,
and
see
to
the
rum
and
*NL*
schiedam
--
maybe
a
dozen
jars
will
be
sufficient
?
--
as
many
of
the
folk
*NL*
will
be
ladies
,
and
perhaps
they
wo
n't
drink
hard
enough
to
make
a
high
*NL*
average
in
the
reckoning
?
But
you
know
best
.
I
've
provided
for
men
and
*NL*
shipmates
times
enough
,
but
I
'm
as
ignorant
as
a
child
how
many
glasses
*NL*
of
grog
a
woman
,
that
's
not
a
drinking
woman
,
is
expected
to
consume
at
*NL*
these
ceremonies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
none
--
we
'll
no
want
much
of
that
--
O
no
!
''
said
Farfrae
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
with
appalled
gravity
.
``
Do
you
leave
all
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
gone
a
little
further
in
these
particulars
Newson
,
leaning
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
and
smiling
reflectively
at
the
ceiling
,
said
,
``
I
've
*NL*
never
told
ye
,
or
have
I
,
Mr.
Farfrae
,
how
Henchard
put
me
off
the
scent
*NL*
that
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
expressed
ignorance
of
what
the
Captain
alluded
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
thought
I
had
n't
.
I
resolved
that
I
would
not
,
I
remember
,
not
*NL*
to
hurt
the
man
's
name
.
But
now
he
's
gone
I
can
tell
ye
.
Why
,
I
came
to
*NL*
Casterbridge
nine
or
ten
months
before
that
day
last
week
that
I
found
*NL*
ye
out
.
I
had
been
here
twice
before
then
.
The
first
time
I
passed
*NL*
through
the
town
on
my
way
westward
,
not
knowing
Elizabeth
lived
here
.
*NL*
Then
hearing
at
some
place
--
I
forget
where
--
that
a
man
of
the
name
of
*NL*
Henchard
had
been
mayor
here
,
I
came
back
,
and
called
at
his
house
one
*NL*
morning
.
The
old
rascal
!
--
he
said
Elizabeth-Jane
had
died
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
now
gave
earnest
heed
to
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
it
never
crossed
my
mind
that
the
man
was
selling
me
a
packet
,
''
*NL*
continued
Newson
.
``
And
,
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
I
was
that
upset
,
that
*NL*
I
went
back
to
the
coach
that
had
brought
me
,
and
took
passage
onward
*NL*
without
lying
in
the
town
half-an-hour
.
Ha-ha
!
--
't
was
a
good
joke
,
and
*NL*
well
carried
out
,
and
I
give
the
man
credit
for
`
t
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
was
amazed
at
the
intelligence
.
``
A
joke
?
--
O
no
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
.
``
Then
he
kept
you
from
me
,
father
,
all
those
months
,
when
you
*NL*
might
have
been
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
admitted
that
such
was
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
not
to
have
done
it
!
''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
sighed
.
``
I
said
I
would
never
forget
him
.
But
O
!
I
think
I
*NL*
ought
to
forget
him
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newson
,
like
a
good
many
rovers
and
sojourners
among
strange
men
and
*NL*
strange
moralities
,
failed
to
perceive
the
enormity
of
Henchard
's
crime
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
that
he
himself
had
been
the
chief
sufferer
therefrom
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
attack
upon
the
absent
culprit
waxing
serious
,
he
began
to
*NL*
take
Henchard
's
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
't
was
not
ten
words
that
he
said
,
after
all
,
''
Newson
pleaded
.
*NL*
``
And
how
could
he
know
that
I
should
be
such
a
simpleton
as
to
believe
*NL*
him
?
'T
was
as
much
my
fault
as
his
,
poor
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Elizabeth-Jane
firmly
,
in
her
revulsion
of
feeling
.
``
He
knew
*NL*
your
disposition
--
you
always
were
so
trusting
,
father
;
I
've
heard
my
*NL*
mother
say
so
hundreds
of
times
--
and
he
did
it
to
wrong
you
.
After
*NL*
weaning
me
from
you
these
five
years
by
saying
he
was
my
father
,
he
*NL*
should
not
have
done
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
conversed
;
and
there
was
nobody
to
set
before
Elizabeth
*NL*
any
extenuation
of
the
absent
one
's
deceit
.
Even
had
he
been
present
*NL*
Henchard
might
scarce
have
pleaded
it
,
so
little
did
he
value
himself
or
*NL*
his
good
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
--
never
mind
--
it
is
all
over
and
past
,
''
said
Newson
*NL*
good-naturedly
.
``
Now
,
about
this
wedding
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
44
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
man
of
their
talk
had
pursued
his
solitary
way
eastward
*NL*
till
weariness
overtook
him
,
and
he
looked
about
for
a
place
of
rest
.
*NL*
His
heart
was
so
exacerbated
at
parting
from
the
girl
that
he
could
not
*NL*
face
an
inn
,
or
even
a
household
of
the
most
humble
kind
;
and
entering
*NL*
a
field
he
lay
down
under
a
wheatrick
,
feeling
no
want
of
food
.
The
very
*NL*
heaviness
of
his
soul
caused
him
to
sleep
profoundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bright
autumn
sun
shining
into
his
eyes
across
the
stubble
awoke
him
*NL*
the
next
morning
early
.
He
opened
his
basket
and
ate
for
his
breakfast
*NL*
what
he
had
packed
for
his
supper
;
and
in
doing
so
overhauled
the
*NL*
remainder
of
his
kit
.
Although
everything
he
brought
necessitated
*NL*
carriage
at
his
own
back
,
he
had
secreted
among
his
tools
a
few
of
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
's
cast-off
belongings
,
in
the
shape
of
gloves
,
shoes
,
a
*NL*
scrap
of
her
handwriting
,
and
the
like
,
and
in
his
pocket
he
carried
a
*NL*
curl
of
her
hair
.
Having
looked
at
these
things
he
closed
them
up
again
,
*NL*
and
went
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
five
consecutive
days
Henchard
's
rush
basket
rode
along
upon
*NL*
his
shoulder
between
the
highway
hedges
,
the
new
yellow
of
the
rushes
*NL*
catching
the
eye
of
an
occasional
field-labourer
as
he
glanced
through
*NL*
the
quickset
,
together
with
the
wayfarer
's
hat
and
head
,
and
down-turned
*NL*
face
,
over
which
the
twig
shadows
moved
in
endless
procession
.
It
now
*NL*
became
apparent
that
the
direction
of
his
journey
was
Weydon
Priors
,
*NL*
which
he
reached
on
the
afternoon
of
the
sixth
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
renowned
hill
whereon
the
annual
fair
had
been
held
for
so
many
*NL*
generations
was
now
bare
of
human
beings
,
and
almost
of
aught
besides
.
A
*NL*
few
sheep
grazed
thereabout
,
but
these
ran
off
when
Henchard
halted
upon
*NL*
the
summit
.
He
deposited
his
basket
upon
the
turf
,
and
looked
about
with
*NL*
sad
curiosity
;
till
he
discovered
the
road
by
which
his
wife
and
himself
*NL*
had
entered
on
the
upland
so
memorable
to
both
,
five-and-twenty
years
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
came
up
that
way
,
''
he
said
,
after
ascertaining
his
bearings
.
*NL*
``
She
was
carrying
the
baby
,
and
I
was
reading
a
ballet-sheet
.
Then
we
*NL*
crossed
about
here
--
she
so
sad
and
weary
,
and
I
speaking
to
her
hardly
*NL*
at
all
,
because
of
my
cursed
pride
and
mortification
at
being
poor
.
*NL*
Then
we
saw
the
tent
--
that
must
have
stood
more
this
way
.
''
He
walked
to
*NL*
another
spot
,
it
was
not
really
where
the
tent
had
stood
but
it
seemed
*NL*
so
to
him
.
``
Here
we
went
in
,
and
here
we
sat
down
.
I
faced
this
way
.
*NL*
Then
I
drank
,
and
committed
my
crime
.
It
must
have
been
just
on
that
*NL*
very
pixy-ring
that
she
was
standing
when
she
said
her
last
words
to
me
*NL*
before
going
off
with
him
;
I
can
hear
their
sound
now
,
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
her
sobs
:
'
O
Mike
!
I
've
lived
with
thee
all
this
while
,
and
had
nothing
*NL*
but
temper
.
Now
I
'm
no
more
to
`
ee
--
I
'll
try
my
luck
elsewhere
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
experienced
not
only
the
bitterness
of
a
man
who
finds
,
in
looking
*NL*
back
upon
an
ambitious
course
,
that
what
he
has
sacrificed
in
sentiment
*NL*
was
worth
as
much
as
what
he
has
gained
in
substance
;
but
the
superadded
*NL*
bitterness
of
seeing
his
very
recantation
nullified
.
He
had
been
sorry
*NL*
for
all
this
long
ago
;
but
his
attempts
to
replace
ambition
by
love
had
*NL*
been
as
fully
foiled
as
his
ambition
itself
.
His
wronged
wife
had
foiled
*NL*
them
by
a
fraud
so
grandly
simple
as
to
be
almost
a
virtue
.
It
was
an
*NL*
odd
sequence
that
out
of
all
this
tampering
with
social
law
came
that
*NL*
flower
of
Nature
,
Elizabeth
.
Part
of
his
wish
to
wash
his
hands
of
*NL*
life
arose
from
his
perception
of
its
contrarious
inconsistencies
--
of
*NL*
Nature
's
jaunty
readiness
to
support
unorthodox
social
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
intended
to
go
on
from
this
place
--
visited
as
an
act
of
penance
--
into
*NL*
another
part
of
the
country
altogether
.
But
he
could
not
help
thinking
*NL*
of
Elizabeth
,
and
the
quarter
of
the
horizon
in
which
she
lived
.
Out
of
*NL*
this
it
happened
that
the
centrifugal
tendency
imparted
by
weariness
of
*NL*
the
world
was
counteracted
by
the
centripetal
influence
of
his
love
*NL*
for
his
stepdaughter
.
As
a
consequence
,
instead
of
following
a
straight
*NL*
course
yet
further
away
from
Casterbridge
,
Henchard
gradually
,
almost
*NL*
unconsciously
,
deflected
from
that
right
line
of
his
first
intention
;
*NL*
till
,
by
degrees
,
his
wandering
,
like
that
of
the
Canadian
woodsman
,
*NL*
became
part
of
a
circle
of
which
Casterbridge
formed
the
centre
.
In
*NL*
ascending
any
particular
hill
he
ascertained
the
bearings
as
nearly
as
*NL*
he
could
by
means
of
the
sun
,
moon
,
or
stars
,
and
settled
in
his
mind
*NL*
the
exact
direction
in
which
Casterbridge
and
Elizabeth-Jane
lay
.
*NL*
Sneering
at
himself
for
his
weakness
he
yet
every
hour
--
nay
,
every
few
*NL*
minutes
--
conjectured
her
actions
for
the
time
being
--
her
sitting
down
*NL*
and
rising
up
,
her
goings
and
comings
,
till
thought
of
Newson
's
and
*NL*
Farfrae
's
counter-influence
would
pass
like
a
cold
blast
over
a
pool
,
*NL*
and
efface
her
image
.
And
then
he
would
say
to
himself
,
``
O
you
fool
!
All
*NL*
this
about
a
daughter
who
is
no
daughter
of
thine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
obtained
employment
at
his
own
occupation
of
hay-trusser
,
*NL*
work
of
that
sort
being
in
demand
at
this
autumn
time
.
The
scene
of
his
*NL*
hiring
was
a
pastoral
farm
near
the
old
western
highway
,
whose
course
*NL*
was
the
channel
of
all
such
communications
as
passed
between
the
busy
*NL*
centres
of
novelty
and
the
remote
Wessex
boroughs
.
He
had
chosen
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
this
artery
from
a
sense
that
,
situated
here
,
though
at
*NL*
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
,
he
was
virtually
nearer
to
her
whose
welfare
*NL*
was
so
dear
than
he
would
be
at
a
roadless
spot
only
half
as
remote
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
Henchard
found
himself
again
on
the
precise
standing
which
he
*NL*
had
occupied
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
.
Externally
there
was
nothing
*NL*
to
hinder
his
making
another
start
on
the
upward
slope
,
and
by
his
new
*NL*
lights
achieving
higher
things
than
his
soul
in
its
half-formed
state
*NL*
had
been
able
to
accomplish
.
But
the
ingenious
machinery
contrived
*NL*
by
the
Gods
for
reducing
human
possibilities
of
amelioration
to
a
*NL*
minimum
--
which
arranges
that
wisdom
to
do
shall
come
pari
passu
with
*NL*
the
departure
of
zest
for
doing
--
stood
in
the
way
of
all
that
.
He
had
*NL*
no
wish
to
make
an
arena
a
second
time
of
a
world
that
had
become
a
mere
*NL*
painted
scene
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
often
,
as
his
hay-knife
crunched
down
among
the
sweet-smelling
*NL*
grassy
stems
,
he
would
survey
mankind
and
say
to
himself
:
``
Here
and
*NL*
everywhere
be
folk
dying
before
their
time
like
frosted
leaves
,
though
*NL*
wanted
by
their
families
,
the
country
,
and
the
world
;
while
I
,
an
*NL*
outcast
,
an
encumberer
of
the
ground
,
wanted
by
nobody
,
and
despised
by
*NL*
all
,
live
on
against
my
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
often
kept
an
eager
ear
upon
the
conversation
of
those
who
passed
*NL*
along
the
road
--
not
from
a
general
curiosity
by
any
means
--
but
in
the
*NL*
hope
that
among
these
travellers
between
Casterbridge
and
London
*NL*
some
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
speak
of
the
former
place
.
The
distance
,
*NL*
however
,
was
too
great
to
lend
much
probability
to
his
desire
;
and
the
*NL*
highest
result
of
his
attention
to
wayside
words
was
that
he
did
*NL*
indeed
hear
the
name
``
Casterbridge
''
uttered
one
day
by
the
driver
of
*NL*
a
road-waggon
.
Henchard
ran
to
the
gate
of
the
field
he
worked
in
,
and
*NL*
hailed
the
speaker
,
who
was
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
've
come
from
there
,
maister
,
''
he
said
,
in
answer
to
Henchard
's
*NL*
inquiry
.
``
I
trade
up
and
down
,
ye
know
;
though
,
what
with
this
*NL*
travelling
without
horses
that
's
getting
so
common
,
my
work
will
soon
be
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
moving
in
the
old
place
,
mid
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
as
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
that
Mr.
Farfrae
,
the
late
mayor
,
is
thinking
of
getting
*NL*
married
.
Now
is
that
true
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
say
for
the
life
o
'
me
.
O
no
,
I
should
think
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
yes
,
John
--
you
forget
,
''
said
a
woman
inside
the
waggon-tilt
.
``
What
*NL*
were
them
packages
we
carr
'd
there
at
the
beginning
o
'
the
week
?
Surely
*NL*
they
said
a
wedding
was
coming
off
soon
--
on
Martin
's
Day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
declared
he
remembered
nothing
about
it
;
and
the
waggon
went
on
*NL*
jangling
over
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
was
convinced
that
the
woman
's
memory
served
her
well
.
The
date
*NL*
was
an
extremely
probable
one
,
there
being
no
reason
for
delay
on
either
*NL*
side
.
He
might
,
for
that
matter
,
write
and
inquire
of
Elizabeth
;
but
his
*NL*
instinct
for
sequestration
had
made
the
course
difficult
.
Yet
before
he
*NL*
left
her
she
had
said
that
for
him
to
be
absent
from
her
wedding
was
not
*NL*
as
she
wished
it
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remembrance
would
continually
revive
in
him
now
that
it
was
not
*NL*
Elizabeth
and
Farfrae
who
had
driven
him
away
from
them
,
but
his
own
*NL*
haughty
sense
that
his
presence
was
no
longer
desired
.
He
had
assumed
*NL*
the
return
of
Newson
without
absolute
proof
that
the
Captain
meant
to
*NL*
return
;
still
less
that
Elizabeth-Jane
would
welcome
him
;
and
with
no
*NL*
proof
whatever
that
if
he
did
return
he
would
stay
.
What
if
he
had
*NL*
been
mistaken
in
his
views
;
if
there
had
been
no
necessity
that
his
*NL*
own
absolute
separation
from
her
he
loved
should
be
involved
in
these
*NL*
untoward
incidents
?
To
make
one
more
attempt
to
be
near
her
:
to
go
back
,
*NL*
to
see
her
,
to
plead
his
cause
before
her
,
to
ask
forgiveness
for
his
*NL*
fraud
,
to
endeavour
strenuously
to
hold
his
own
in
her
love
;
it
was
*NL*
worth
the
risk
of
repulse
,
ay
,
of
life
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
to
initiate
this
reversal
of
all
his
former
resolves
without
*NL*
causing
husband
and
wife
to
despise
him
for
his
inconsistency
was
a
*NL*
question
which
made
him
tremble
and
brood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cut
and
cut
his
trusses
two
days
more
,
and
then
he
concluded
his
*NL*
hesitancies
by
a
sudden
reckless
determination
to
go
to
the
wedding
*NL*
festivity
.
Neither
writing
nor
message
would
be
expected
of
him
.
She
had
*NL*
regretted
his
decision
to
be
absent
--
his
unanticipated
presence
would
*NL*
fill
the
little
unsatisfied
corner
that
would
probably
have
place
in
her
*NL*
just
heart
without
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
intrude
as
little
of
his
personality
as
possible
upon
a
gay
event
*NL*
with
which
that
personality
could
show
nothing
in
keeping
,
he
decided
*NL*
not
to
make
his
appearance
till
evening
--
when
stiffness
would
have
worn
*NL*
off
,
and
a
gentle
wish
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
would
exercise
its
sway
*NL*
in
all
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
on
foot
,
two
mornings
before
St.
Martin
's
-
tide
,
allowing
*NL*
himself
about
sixteen
miles
to
perform
for
each
of
the
three
days
'
*NL*
journey
,
reckoning
the
wedding-day
as
one
.
There
were
only
two
towns
,
*NL*
Melchester
and
Shottsford
,
of
any
importance
along
his
course
,
and
at
*NL*
the
latter
he
stopped
on
the
second
night
,
not
only
to
rest
,
but
to
*NL*
prepare
himself
for
the
next
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possessing
no
clothes
but
the
working
suit
he
stood
in
--
now
stained
and
*NL*
distorted
by
their
two
months
of
hard
usage
,
he
entered
a
shop
to
make
*NL*
some
purchases
which
should
put
him
,
externally
at
any
rate
,
a
little
in
*NL*
harmony
with
the
prevailing
tone
of
the
morrow
.
A
rough
yet
respectable
*NL*
coat
and
hat
,
a
new
shirt
and
neck-cloth
,
were
the
chief
of
these
;
and
*NL*
having
satisfied
himself
that
in
appearance
at
least
he
would
not
now
*NL*
offend
her
,
he
proceeded
to
the
more
interesting
particular
of
buying
*NL*
her
some
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
should
that
present
be
?
He
walked
up
and
down
the
street
,
regarding
*NL*
dubiously
the
display
in
the
shop
windows
,
from
a
gloomy
sense
that
what
*NL*
he
might
most
like
to
give
her
would
be
beyond
his
miserable
pocket
.
*NL*
At
length
a
caged
goldfinch
met
his
eye
.
The
cage
was
a
plain
and
small
*NL*
one
,
the
shop
humble
,
and
on
inquiry
he
concluded
he
could
afford
*NL*
the
modest
sum
asked
.
A
sheet
of
newspaper
was
tied
round
the
little
*NL*
creature
's
wire
prison
,
and
with
the
wrapped
up
cage
in
his
hand
*NL*
Henchard
sought
a
lodging
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
set
out
upon
the
last
stage
,
and
was
soon
within
the
*NL*
district
which
had
been
his
dealing
ground
in
bygone
years
.
Part
of
the
*NL*
distance
he
travelled
by
carrier
,
seating
himself
in
the
darkest
corner
*NL*
at
the
back
of
that
trader
's
van
;
and
as
the
other
passengers
,
mainly
*NL*
women
going
short
journeys
,
mounted
and
alighted
in
front
of
Henchard
,
*NL*
they
talked
over
much
local
news
,
not
the
least
portion
of
this
being
*NL*
the
wedding
then
in
course
of
celebration
at
the
town
they
were
nearing
.
*NL*
It
appeared
from
their
accounts
that
the
town
band
had
been
hired
for
*NL*
the
evening
party
,
and
,
lest
the
convivial
instincts
of
that
body
*NL*
should
get
the
better
of
their
skill
,
the
further
step
had
been
taken
of
*NL*
engaging
the
string
band
from
Budmouth
,
so
that
there
would
be
a
reserve
*NL*
of
harmony
to
fall
back
upon
in
case
of
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
,
however
,
but
few
particulars
beyond
those
known
to
him
*NL*
already
,
the
incident
of
the
deepest
interest
on
the
journey
being
the
*NL*
soft
pealing
of
the
Casterbridge
bells
,
which
reached
the
travellers
'
*NL*
ears
while
the
van
paused
on
the
top
of
Yalbury
Hill
to
have
the
drag
*NL*
lowered
.
The
time
was
just
after
twelve
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
notes
were
a
signal
that
all
had
gone
well
;
that
there
had
been
*NL*
no
slip
`
twixt
cup
and
lip
in
this
case
;
that
Elizabeth-Jane
and
Donald
*NL*
Farfrae
were
man
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
did
not
care
to
ride
any
further
with
his
chattering
companions
*NL*
after
hearing
this
sound
.
Indeed
,
it
quite
unmanned
him
;
and
in
*NL*
pursuance
of
his
plan
of
not
showing
himself
in
Casterbridge
street
till
*NL*
evening
,
lest
he
should
mortify
Farfrae
and
his
bride
,
he
alighted
here
,
*NL*
with
his
bundle
and
bird-cage
,
and
was
soon
left
as
a
lonely
figure
on
*NL*
the
broad
white
highway
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
hill
near
which
he
had
waited
to
meet
Farfrae
,
almost
two
*NL*
years
earlier
,
to
tell
him
of
the
serious
illness
of
his
wife
Lucetta
.
*NL*
The
place
was
unchanged
;
the
same
larches
sighed
the
same
notes
;
but
*NL*
Farfrae
had
another
wife
--
and
,
as
Henchard
knew
,
a
better
one
.
He
only
*NL*
hoped
that
Elizabeth-Jane
had
obtained
a
better
home
than
had
been
hers
*NL*
at
the
former
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
in
a
curious
highstrung
*NL*
condition
,
unable
to
do
much
but
think
of
the
approaching
meeting
with
*NL*
her
,
and
sadly
satirize
himself
for
his
emotions
thereon
,
as
a
Samson
*NL*
shorn
.
Such
an
innovation
on
Casterbridge
customs
as
a
flitting
of
*NL*
bridegroom
and
bride
from
the
town
immediately
after
the
ceremony
,
was
*NL*
not
likely
,
but
if
it
should
have
taken
place
he
would
wait
till
their
*NL*
return
.
To
assure
himself
on
this
point
he
asked
a
market-man
when
near
*NL*
the
borough
if
the
newly-married
couple
had
gone
away
,
and
was
promptly
*NL*
informed
that
they
had
not
;
they
were
at
that
hour
,
according
to
all
*NL*
accounts
,
entertaining
a
houseful
of
guests
at
their
home
in
Corn
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
dusted
his
boots
,
washed
his
hands
at
the
riverside
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
up
the
town
under
the
feeble
lamps
.
He
need
have
made
no
*NL*
inquiries
beforehand
,
for
on
drawing
near
Farfrae
's
residence
it
was
*NL*
plain
to
the
least
observant
that
festivity
prevailed
within
,
and
that
*NL*
Donald
himself
shared
it
,
his
voice
being
distinctly
audible
in
the
*NL*
street
,
giving
strong
expression
to
a
song
of
his
dear
native
country
*NL*
that
he
loved
so
well
as
never
to
have
revisited
it
.
Idlers
were
*NL*
standing
on
the
pavement
in
front
;
and
wishing
to
escape
the
notice
of
*NL*
these
Henchard
passed
quickly
on
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wide
open
,
the
hall
was
lighted
extravagantly
,
and
people
were
*NL*
going
up
and
down
the
stairs
.
His
courage
failed
him
;
to
enter
footsore
,
*NL*
laden
,
and
poorly
dressed
into
the
midst
of
such
resplendency
was
to
*NL*
bring
needless
humiliation
upon
her
he
loved
,
if
not
to
court
repulse
*NL*
from
her
husband
.
Accordingly
he
went
round
into
the
street
at
the
back
*NL*
that
he
knew
so
well
,
entered
the
garden
,
and
came
quietly
into
the
*NL*
house
through
the
kitchen
,
temporarily
depositing
the
bird
and
cage
*NL*
under
a
bush
outside
,
to
lessen
the
awkwardness
of
his
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Solitude
and
sadness
had
so
emolliated
Henchard
that
he
now
feared
*NL*
circumstances
he
would
formerly
have
scorned
,
and
he
began
to
wish
that
*NL*
he
had
not
taken
upon
himself
to
arrive
at
such
a
juncture
.
However
,
*NL*
his
progress
was
made
unexpectedly
easy
by
his
discovering
alone
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
an
elderly
woman
who
seemed
to
be
acting
as
provisional
*NL*
housekeeper
during
the
convulsions
from
which
Farfrae
's
establishment
*NL*
was
just
then
suffering
.
She
was
one
of
those
people
whom
nothing
*NL*
surprises
,
and
though
to
her
,
a
total
stranger
,
his
request
must
have
*NL*
seemed
odd
,
she
willingly
volunteered
to
go
up
and
inform
the
master
and
*NL*
mistress
of
the
house
that
``
a
humble
old
friend
''
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
second
thought
she
said
that
he
had
better
not
wait
in
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
but
come
up
into
the
little
back-parlour
,
which
was
empty
.
He
thereupon
*NL*
followed
her
thither
,
and
she
left
him
.
Just
as
she
got
across
the
*NL*
landing
to
the
door
of
the
best
parlour
a
dance
was
struck
up
,
and
she
*NL*
returned
to
say
that
she
would
wait
till
that
was
over
before
announcing
*NL*
him
--
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Farfrae
having
both
joined
in
the
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
front
room
had
been
taken
off
its
hinges
to
give
more
*NL*
space
,
and
that
of
the
room
Henchard
sat
in
being
ajar
,
he
could
see
*NL*
fractional
parts
of
the
dancers
whenever
their
gyrations
brought
them
*NL*
near
the
doorway
,
chiefly
in
the
shape
of
the
skirts
of
dresses
and
*NL*
streaming
curls
of
hair
;
together
with
about
three-fifths
of
the
band
in
*NL*
profile
,
including
the
restless
shadow
of
a
fiddler
's
elbow
,
and
the
tip
*NL*
of
the
bass-viol
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gaiety
jarred
upon
Henchard
's
spirits
;
and
he
could
not
quite
*NL*
understand
why
Farfrae
,
a
much-sobered
man
,
and
a
widower
,
who
had
had
*NL*
his
trials
,
should
have
cared
for
it
all
,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
*NL*
he
was
quite
a
young
man
still
,
and
quickly
kindled
to
enthusiasm
by
*NL*
dance
and
song
.
That
the
quiet
Elizabeth
,
who
had
long
ago
appraised
*NL*
life
at
a
moderate
value
,
and
who
knew
in
spite
of
her
maidenhood
that
*NL*
marriage
was
as
a
rule
no
dancing
matter
,
should
have
had
zest
for
this
*NL*
revelry
surprised
him
still
more
.
However
,
young
people
could
not
be
*NL*
quite
old
people
,
he
concluded
,
and
custom
was
omnipotent
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
progress
of
the
dance
the
performers
spread
out
somewhat
,
*NL*
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
once
despised
*NL*
daughter
who
had
mastered
him
,
and
made
his
heart
ache
.
She
was
in
a
*NL*
dress
of
white
silk
or
satin
,
he
was
not
near
enough
to
say
which
--
snowy
*NL*
white
,
without
a
tinge
of
milk
or
cream
;
and
the
expression
of
her
face
*NL*
was
one
of
nervous
pleasure
rather
than
of
gaiety
.
Presently
Farfrae
*NL*
came
round
,
his
exuberant
Scotch
movement
making
him
conspicuous
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
The
pair
were
not
dancing
together
,
but
Henchard
could
discern
*NL*
that
whenever
the
chances
of
the
figure
made
them
the
partners
of
a
*NL*
moment
their
emotions
breathed
a
much
subtler
essence
than
at
other
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
Henchard
became
aware
that
the
measure
was
trod
by
some
one
*NL*
who
out-Farfraed
Farfrae
in
saltatory
intenseness
.
This
was
strange
,
*NL*
and
it
was
stranger
to
find
that
the
eclipsing
personage
was
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
's
partner
.
The
first
time
that
Henchard
saw
him
he
was
*NL*
sweeping
grandly
round
,
his
head
quivering
and
low
down
,
his
legs
in
the
*NL*
form
of
an
X
and
his
back
towards
the
door
.
The
next
time
he
came
round
*NL*
in
the
other
direction
,
his
white
waist-coat
preceding
his
face
,
and
his
*NL*
toes
preceding
his
white
waistcoat
.
That
happy
face
--
Henchard
's
complete
*NL*
discomfiture
lay
in
it
.
It
was
Newson
's
,
who
had
indeed
come
and
*NL*
supplanted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
pushed
to
the
door
,
and
for
some
seconds
made
no
other
*NL*
movement
.
He
rose
to
his
feet
,
and
stood
like
a
dark
ruin
,
obscured
by
*NL*
``
the
shade
from
his
own
soul
up-thrown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
no
longer
the
man
to
stand
these
reverses
unmoved
.
His
*NL*
agitation
was
great
,
and
he
would
fain
have
been
gone
,
but
before
*NL*
he
could
leave
the
dance
had
ended
,
the
housekeeper
had
informed
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
of
the
stranger
who
awaited
her
,
and
she
entered
the
room
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
it
is
--
Mr.
Henchard
!
''
she
said
,
starting
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Elizabeth
?
''
he
cried
,
as
she
seized
her
hand
.
``
What
do
you
*NL*
say
?
--
Mr.
Henchard
?
Do
n't
,
do
n't
scourge
me
like
that
!
Call
me
worthless
*NL*
old
Henchard
--
anything
--
but
do
n't
`
ee
be
so
cold
as
this
!
O
my
maid
--
I
*NL*
see
you
have
another
--
a
real
father
in
my
place
.
Then
you
know
all
;
but
*NL*
do
n't
give
all
your
thought
to
him
!
Do
ye
save
a
little
room
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
up
,
and
gently
drew
her
hand
away
.
``
I
could
have
loved
you
*NL*
always
--
I
would
have
,
gladly
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
how
can
I
when
I
know
you
*NL*
have
deceived
me
so
--
so
bitterly
deceived
me
!
You
persuaded
me
that
*NL*
my
father
was
not
my
father
--
allowed
me
to
live
on
in
ignorance
of
the
*NL*
truth
for
years
;
and
then
when
he
,
my
warm-hearted
real
father
,
came
*NL*
to
find
me
,
cruelly
sent
him
away
with
a
wicked
invention
of
my
death
,
*NL*
which
nearly
broke
his
heart
.
O
how
can
I
love
as
I
once
did
a
man
who
*NL*
has
served
us
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henchard
's
lips
half
parted
to
begin
an
explanation
.
But
he
shut
them
up
*NL*
like
a
vice
,
and
uttered
not
a
sound
.
How
should
he
,
there
and
then
,
set
*NL*
before
her
with
any
effect
the
palliatives
of
his
great
faults
--
that
he
*NL*
had
himself
been
deceived
in
her
identity
at
first
,
till
informed
by
*NL*
her
mother
's
letter
that
his
own
child
had
died
;
that
,
in
the
second
*NL*
accusation
,
his
lie
had
been
the
last
desperate
throw
of
a
gamester
*NL*
who
loved
her
affection
better
than
his
own
honour
?
Among
the
many
*NL*
hindrances
to
such
a
pleading
not
the
least
was
this
,
that
he
did
not
*NL*
sufficiently
value
himself
to
lessen
his
sufferings
by
strenuous
appeal
*NL*
or
elaborate
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waiving
,
therefore
,
his
privilege
of
self-defence
,
he
regarded
only
his
*NL*
discomposure
.
``
Do
n't
ye
distress
yourself
on
my
account
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
proud
superiority
.
``
I
would
not
wish
it
--
at
such
a
time
,
too
,
as
this
.
*NL*
I
have
done
wrong
in
coming
to
`
ee
--
I
see
my
error
.
But
it
is
only
for
*NL*
once
,
so
forgive
it
.
I
'll
never
trouble
`
ee
again
,
Elizabeth-Jane
--
no
,
*NL*
not
to
my
dying
day
!
Good-night
.
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
before
she
could
collect
her
thoughts
,
Henchard
went
out
from
her
*NL*
rooms
,
and
departed
from
the
house
by
the
back
way
as
he
had
come
;
and
*NL*
she
saw
him
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
45
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
a
month
after
the
day
which
closed
as
in
the
last
chapter
.
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
novelty
of
her
situation
,
and
*NL*
the
only
difference
between
Donald
's
movements
now
and
formerly
was
that
*NL*
he
hastened
indoors
rather
more
quickly
after
business
hours
than
he
had
*NL*
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newson
had
stayed
in
Casterbridge
three
days
after
the
wedding
party
*NL*
-LRB-
whose
gaiety
,
as
might
have
been
surmised
,
was
of
his
making
rather
*NL*
than
of
the
married
couple
's
-RRB-
,
and
was
stared
at
and
honoured
as
became
*NL*
the
returned
Crusoe
of
the
hour
.
But
whether
or
not
because
Casterbridge
*NL*
was
difficult
to
excite
by
dramatic
returns
and
disappearances
through
*NL*
having
been
for
centuries
an
assize
town
,
in
which
sensational
exits
*NL*
from
the
world
,
antipodean
absences
,
and
such
like
,
were
half-yearly
*NL*
occurrences
,
the
inhabitants
did
not
altogether
lose
their
equanimity
*NL*
on
his
account
.
On
the
fourth
morning
he
was
discovered
disconsolately
*NL*
climbing
a
hill
,
in
his
craving
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
from
*NL*
somewhere
or
other
.
The
contiguity
of
salt
water
proved
to
be
such
a
*NL*
necessity
of
his
existence
that
he
preferred
Budmouth
as
a
place
of
*NL*
residence
,
notwithstanding
the
society
of
his
daughter
in
the
other
*NL*
town
.
Thither
he
went
,
and
settled
in
lodgings
in
a
green-shuttered
*NL*
cottage
which
had
a
bow-window
,
jutting
out
sufficiently
to
afford
*NL*
glimpses
of
a
vertical
strip
of
blue
sea
to
any
one
opening
the
sash
,
*NL*
and
leaning
forward
far
enough
to
look
through
a
narrow
lane
of
tall
*NL*
intervening
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
her
upstairs
parlour
,
*NL*
critically
surveying
some
re-arrangement
of
articles
with
her
head
to
*NL*
one
side
,
when
the
housemaid
came
in
with
the
announcement
,
``
Oh
,
please
*NL*
ma'am
,
we
know
now
how
that
bird-cage
came
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
exploring
her
new
domain
during
the
first
week
of
residence
,
gazing
*NL*
with
critical
satisfaction
on
this
cheerful
room
and
that
,
penetrating
*NL*
cautiously
into
dark
cellars
,
sallying
forth
with
gingerly
tread
to
*NL*
the
garden
,
now
leaf-strewn
by
autumn
winds
,
and
thus
,
like
a
wise
*NL*
field-marshal
,
estimating
the
capabilities
of
the
site
whereon
she
*NL*
was
about
to
open
her
housekeeping
campaign
--
Mrs.
Donald
Farfrae
had
*NL*
discovered
in
a
screened
corner
a
new
bird-cage
,
shrouded
in
newspaper
,
*NL*
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
cage
a
little
ball
of
feathers
--
the
dead
body
*NL*
of
a
goldfinch
.
Nobody
could
tell
her
how
the
bird
and
cage
had
come
*NL*
there
,
though
that
the
poor
little
songster
had
been
starved
to
death
*NL*
was
evident
.
The
sadness
of
the
incident
had
made
an
impression
on
her
.
*NL*
She
had
not
been
able
to
forget
it
for
days
,
despite
Farfrae
's
tender
*NL*
banter
;
and
now
when
the
matter
had
been
nearly
forgotten
it
was
again
*NL*
revived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
ma'am
,
we
know
how
the
bird-cage
came
there
.
That
farmer
's
*NL*
man
who
called
on
the
evening
of
the
wedding
--
he
was
seen
wi
'
it
in
his
*NL*
hand
as
he
came
up
the
street
;
and
't
is
thoughted
that
he
put
it
down
*NL*
while
he
came
in
with
his
message
,
and
then
went
away
forgetting
where
*NL*
he
had
left
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
enough
to
set
Elizabeth
thinking
,
and
in
thinking
she
seized
*NL*
hold
of
the
idea
,
at
one
feminine
bound
,
that
the
caged
bird
had
been
*NL*
brought
by
Henchard
for
her
as
a
wedding
gift
and
token
of
repentance
.
*NL*
He
had
not
expressed
to
her
any
regrets
or
excuses
for
what
he
had
done
*NL*
in
the
past
;
but
it
was
a
part
of
his
nature
to
extenuate
nothing
,
and
*NL*
live
on
as
one
of
his
own
worst
accusers
.
She
went
out
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
cage
,
buried
the
starved
little
singer
,
and
from
that
hour
her
heart
*NL*
softened
towards
the
self-alienated
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
husband
came
in
she
told
him
her
solution
of
the
bird-cage
*NL*
mystery
;
and
begged
Donald
to
help
her
in
finding
out
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
,
whither
Henchard
had
banished
himself
,
that
she
might
make
her
*NL*
peace
with
him
;
try
to
do
something
to
render
his
life
less
that
of
*NL*
an
outcast
,
and
more
tolerable
to
him
.
Although
Farfrae
had
never
so
*NL*
passionately
liked
Henchard
as
Henchard
had
liked
him
,
he
had
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
never
so
passionately
hated
in
the
same
direction
as
his
*NL*
former
friend
had
done
,
and
he
was
therefore
not
the
least
indisposed
to
*NL*
assist
Elizabeth-Jane
in
her
laudable
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
by
no
means
easy
to
set
about
discovering
Henchard
.
He
had
*NL*
apparently
sunk
into
the
earth
on
leaving
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Farfrae
's
door
.
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
remembered
what
he
had
once
attempted
;
and
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
she
did
not
know
it
Henchard
had
become
a
changed
man
since
*NL*
then
--
as
far
,
that
is
,
as
change
of
emotional
basis
can
justify
such
*NL*
a
radical
phrase
;
and
she
needed
not
to
fear
.
In
a
few
days
Farfrae
's
*NL*
inquiries
elicited
that
Henchard
had
been
seen
by
one
who
knew
him
*NL*
walking
steadily
along
the
Melchester
highway
eastward
,
at
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
at
night
--
in
other
words
,
retracing
his
steps
on
the
road
by
*NL*
which
he
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
enough
;
and
the
next
morning
Farfrae
might
have
been
discovered
*NL*
driving
his
gig
out
of
Casterbridge
in
that
direction
,
Elizabeth-Jane
*NL*
sitting
beside
him
,
wrapped
in
a
thick
flat
fur
--
the
victorine
of
the
*NL*
period
--
her
complexion
somewhat
richer
than
formerly
,
and
an
incipient
*NL*
matronly
dignity
,
which
the
serene
Minerva-eyes
of
one
``
whose
gestures
*NL*
beamed
with
mind
''
made
becoming
,
settling
on
her
face
.
Having
herself
*NL*
arrived
at
a
promising
haven
from
at
least
the
grosser
troubles
of
her
*NL*
life
,
her
object
was
to
place
Henchard
in
some
similar
quietude
before
*NL*
he
should
sink
into
that
lower
stage
of
existence
which
was
only
too
*NL*
possible
to
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
driving
along
the
highway
for
a
few
miles
they
made
further
*NL*
inquiries
,
and
learnt
of
a
road-mender
,
who
had
been
working
thereabouts
*NL*
for
weeks
,
that
he
had
observed
such
a
man
at
the
time
mentioned
;
he
had
*NL*
left
the
Melchester
coachroad
at
Weatherbury
by
a
forking
highway
which
*NL*
skirted
the
north
of
Egdon
Heath
.
Into
this
road
they
directed
the
*NL*
horse
's
head
,
and
soon
were
bowling
across
that
ancient
country
*NL*
whose
surface
never
had
been
stirred
to
a
finger
's
depth
,
save
by
*NL*
the
scratchings
of
rabbits
,
since
brushed
by
the
feet
of
the
earliest
*NL*
tribes
.
The
tumuli
these
had
left
behind
,
dun
and
shagged
with
heather
,
*NL*
jutted
roundly
into
the
sky
from
the
uplands
,
as
though
they
were
the
*NL*
full
breasts
of
Diana
Multimammia
supinely
extended
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
searched
Egdon
,
but
found
no
Henchard
.
Farfrae
drove
onward
,
and
by
*NL*
the
afternoon
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
some
extension
of
the
heath
*NL*
to
the
north
of
Anglebury
,
a
prominent
feature
of
which
,
in
the
form
of
*NL*
a
blasted
clump
of
firs
on
a
summit
of
a
hill
,
they
soon
passed
under
.
*NL*
That
the
road
they
were
following
had
,
up
to
this
point
,
been
Henchard
's
*NL*
track
on
foot
they
were
pretty
certain
;
but
the
ramifications
which
now
*NL*
began
to
reveal
themselves
in
the
route
made
further
progress
in
the
*NL*
right
direction
a
matter
of
pure
guess-work
,
and
Donald
strongly
advised
*NL*
his
wife
to
give
up
the
search
in
person
,
and
trust
to
other
means
for
*NL*
obtaining
news
of
her
stepfather
.
They
were
now
a
score
of
miles
at
*NL*
least
from
home
,
but
,
by
resting
the
horse
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
*NL*
village
they
had
just
traversed
,
it
would
be
possible
to
get
back
to
*NL*
Casterbridge
that
same
day
,
while
to
go
much
further
afield
would
reduce
*NL*
them
to
the
necessity
of
camping
out
for
the
night
,
``
and
that
will
make
*NL*
a
hole
in
a
sovereign
,
''
said
Farfrae
.
She
pondered
the
position
,
and
*NL*
agreed
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accordingly
drew
rein
,
but
before
reversing
their
direction
paused
a
*NL*
moment
and
looked
vaguely
round
upon
the
wide
country
which
the
elevated
*NL*
position
disclosed
.
While
they
looked
a
solitary
human
form
came
from
*NL*
under
the
clump
of
trees
,
and
crossed
ahead
of
them
.
The
person
was
some
*NL*
labourer
;
his
gait
was
shambling
,
his
regard
fixed
in
front
of
him
as
*NL*
absolutely
as
if
he
wore
blinkers
;
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
few
*NL*
sticks
.
Having
crossed
the
road
he
descended
into
a
ravine
,
where
a
*NL*
cottage
revealed
itself
,
which
he
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
not
so
far
away
from
Casterbridge
I
should
say
that
must
be
*NL*
poor
Whittle
.
'T
is
just
like
him
,
''
observed
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
may
be
Whittle
,
for
he
's
never
been
to
the
yard
these
three
*NL*
weeks
,
going
away
without
saying
any
word
at
all
;
and
I
owing
him
for
*NL*
two
days
'
work
,
without
knowing
who
to
pay
it
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
possibility
led
them
to
alight
,
and
at
least
make
an
inquiry
at
the
*NL*
cottage
.
Farfrae
hitched
the
reins
to
the
gate-post
,
and
they
approached
*NL*
what
was
of
humble
dwellings
surely
the
humblest
.
The
walls
,
built
of
*NL*
kneaded
clay
originally
faced
with
a
trowel
,
had
been
worn
by
years
of
*NL*
rain-washings
to
a
lumpy
crumbling
surface
,
channelled
and
sunken
from
*NL*
its
plane
,
its
gray
rents
held
together
here
and
there
by
a
leafy
strap
*NL*
of
ivy
which
could
scarcely
find
substance
enough
for
the
purpose
.
The
*NL*
rafters
were
sunken
,
and
the
thatch
of
the
roof
in
ragged
holes
.
Leaves
*NL*
from
the
fence
had
been
blown
into
the
corners
of
the
doorway
,
and
lay
*NL*
there
undisturbed
.
The
door
was
ajar
;
Farfrae
knocked
;
and
he
who
stood
*NL*
before
them
was
Whittle
,
as
they
had
conjectured
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
showed
marks
of
deep
sadness
,
his
eyes
lighting
on
them
with
an
*NL*
unfocused
gaze
;
and
he
still
held
in
his
hand
the
few
sticks
he
had
been
*NL*
out
to
gather
.
As
soon
as
he
recognized
them
he
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Abel
Whittle
;
is
it
that
ye
are
heere
?
''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
yes
sir
!
You
see
he
was
kind-like
to
mother
when
she
wer
here
*NL*
below
,
though
'
a
was
rough
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
talking
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
sir
--
Mr.
Henchet
!
Did
n't
ye
know
it
?
He
's
just
gone
--
about
*NL*
half-an-hour
ago
,
by
the
sun
;
for
I
've
got
no
watch
to
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
--
dead
?
''
faltered
Elizabeth-Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
he
's
gone
!
He
was
kind-like
to
mother
when
she
wer
here
*NL*
below
,
sending
her
the
best
ship-coal
,
and
hardly
any
ashes
from
it
at
*NL*
all
;
and
taties
,
and
such-like
that
were
very
needful
to
her
.
I
seed
en
*NL*
go
down
street
on
the
night
of
your
worshipful
's
wedding
to
the
lady
at
*NL*
yer
side
,
and
I
thought
he
looked
low
and
faltering
.
And
I
followed
en
*NL*
over
Grey
's
Bridge
,
and
he
turned
and
zeed
me
,
and
said
,
`
You
go
back
!
'
*NL*
But
I
followed
,
and
he
turned
again
,
and
said
,
`
Do
you
hear
,
sir
?
Go
*NL*
back
!
'
But
I
zeed
that
he
was
low
,
and
I
followed
on
still
.
Then
'
a
*NL*
said
,
`
Whittle
,
what
do
ye
follow
me
for
when
I
've
told
ye
to
go
back
*NL*
all
these
times
?
'
And
I
said
,
`
Because
,
sir
,
I
see
things
be
bad
with
*NL*
`
ee
,
and
ye
wer
kind-like
to
mother
if
ye
wer
rough
to
me
,
and
I
would
*NL*
fain
be
kind-like
to
you
.
'
Then
he
walked
on
,
and
I
followed
;
and
he
*NL*
never
complained
at
me
no
more
.
We
walked
on
like
that
all
night
;
and
*NL*
in
the
blue
o
'
the
morning
,
when
't
was
hardly
day
,
I
looked
ahead
o
'
me
,
*NL*
and
I
zeed
that
he
wambled
,
and
could
hardly
drag
along
.
By
the
time
we
*NL*
had
got
past
here
,
but
I
had
seen
that
this
house
was
empty
as
I
went
*NL*
by
,
and
I
got
him
to
come
back
;
and
I
took
down
the
boards
from
the
*NL*
windows
,
and
helped
him
inside
.
`
What
,
Whittle
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
can
ye
*NL*
really
be
such
a
poor
fond
fool
as
to
care
for
such
a
wretch
as
I
!
'
Then
*NL*
I
went
on
further
,
and
some
neighbourly
woodmen
lent
me
a
bed
,
and
a
*NL*
chair
,
and
a
few
other
traps
,
and
we
brought
'em
here
,
and
made
him
*NL*
as
comfortable
as
we
could
.
But
he
did
n't
gain
strength
,
for
you
see
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
he
could
n't
eat
--
no
appetite
at
all
--
and
he
got
weaker
;
and
*NL*
to-day
he
died
.
One
of
the
neighbours
have
gone
to
get
a
man
to
measure
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
--
is
that
so
!
''
said
Farfrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Elizabeth
,
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
the
head
of
his
bed
he
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
,
with
some
writing
*NL*
upon
it
,
''
continued
Abel
Whittle
.
``
But
not
being
a
man
o
'
letters
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
read
writing
;
so
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
I
can
get
it
and
show
*NL*
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
in
silence
while
he
ran
into
the
cottage
;
returning
in
a
*NL*
moment
with
a
crumpled
scrap
of
paper
.
On
it
there
was
pencilled
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MICHAEL
HENCHARD
'S
WILL
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Elizabeth-Jane
Farfrae
be
not
told
of
my
death
,
or
made
to
grieve
*NL*
on
account
of
me
.
*NL*
''
&
that
I
be
not
bury
'd
in
consecrated
ground
.
*NL*
''
&
that
no
sexton

asked

the
bell

&
that
nobody
is
wished
to

''
&
that
no
murners
walk
behind

at
my
funeral
.
*NL*
''
&
that
no
flours
be
planted
on
my
grave

&
that
no

*NL*
``
To
this
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
MICHAEL
HENCHARD
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
do
?
''
said
Donald
,
when
he
had
handed
the
paper
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
answer
distinctly
.
``
O
Donald
!
''
she
cried
at
last
through
*NL*
her
tears
,
``
what
bitterness
lies
there
!
O
I
would
not
have
minded
so
*NL*
much
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
unkindness
at
that
last
parting
!
...
But
*NL*
there
's
no
altering
--
so
it
must
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
Henchard
had
written
in
the
anguish
of
his
dying
was
respected
as
*NL*
far
as
practicable
by
Elizabeth-Jane
,
though
less
from
a
sense
of
the
*NL*
sacredness
of
last
words
,
as
such
,
than
from
her
independent
knowledge
*NL*
that
the
man
who
wrote
them
meant
what
he
said
.
She
knew
the
directions
*NL*
to
be
a
piece
of
the
same
stuff
that
his
whole
life
was
made
of
,
and
*NL*
hence
were
not
to
be
tampered
with
to
give
herself
a
mournful
pleasure
,
*NL*
or
her
husband
credit
for
large-heartedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
over
at
last
,
even
her
regrets
for
having
misunderstood
him
on
*NL*
his
last
visit
,
for
not
having
searched
him
out
sooner
,
though
*NL*
these
were
deep
and
sharp
for
a
good
while
.
From
this
time
forward
*NL*
Elizabeth-Jane
found
herself
in
a
latitude
of
calm
weather
,
kindly
and
*NL*
grateful
in
itself
,
and
doubly
so
after
the
Capharnaum
in
which
some
of
*NL*
her
preceding
years
had
been
spent
.
As
the
lively
and
sparkling
emotions
*NL*
of
her
early
married
life
cohered
into
an
equable
serenity
,
the
finer
*NL*
movements
of
her
nature
found
scope
in
discovering
to
the
narrow-lived
*NL*
ones
around
her
the
secret
-LRB-
as
she
had
once
learnt
it
-RRB-
of
making
limited
*NL*
opportunities
endurable
;
which
she
deemed
to
consist
in
the
cunning
*NL*
enlargement
,
by
a
species
of
microscopic
treatment
,
of
those
minute
*NL*
forms
of
satisfaction
that
offer
themselves
to
everybody
not
in
positive
*NL*
pain
;
which
,
thus
handled
,
have
much
of
the
same
inspiring
effect
upon
*NL*
life
as
wider
interests
cursorily
embraced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
teaching
had
a
reflex
action
upon
herself
,
insomuch
that
she
thought
*NL*
she
could
perceive
no
great
personal
difference
between
being
respected
*NL*
in
the
nether
parts
of
Casterbridge
and
glorified
at
the
uppermost
end
*NL*
of
the
social
world
.
Her
position
was
,
indeed
,
to
a
marked
degree
one
*NL*
that
,
in
the
common
phrase
,
afforded
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
That
she
*NL*
was
not
demonstratively
thankful
was
no
fault
of
hers
.
Her
experience
*NL*
had
been
of
a
kind
to
teach
her
,
rightly
or
wrongly
,
that
the
doubtful
*NL*
honour
of
a
brief
transmit
through
a
sorry
world
hardly
called
for
*NL*
effusiveness
,
even
when
the
path
was
suddenly
irradiated
at
some
*NL*
half-way
point
by
daybeams
rich
as
hers
.
But
her
strong
sense
that
*NL*
neither
she
nor
any
human
being
deserved
less
than
was
given
,
did
not
*NL*
blind
her
to
the
fact
that
there
were
others
receiving
less
who
had
*NL*
deserved
much
more
.
And
in
being
forced
to
class
herself
among
the
*NL*
fortunate
she
did
not
cease
to
wonder
at
the
persistence
of
the
*NL*
unforeseen
,
when
the
one
to
whom
such
unbroken
tranquility
had
been
*NL*
accorded
in
the
adult
stage
was
she
whose
youth
had
seemed
to
teach
that
*NL*
happiness
was
but
the
occasional
episode
in
a
general
drama
of
pain
.
