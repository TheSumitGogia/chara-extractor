INTRODUCTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
combined
qualities
of
the
realist
and
the
idealist
which
Dickens
*NL*
possessed
to
a
remarkable
degree
,
together
with
his
naturally
jovial
*NL*
attitude
toward
life
in
general
,
seem
to
have
given
him
a
remarkably
*NL*
happy
feeling
toward
Christmas
,
though
the
privations
and
hardships
of
*NL*
his
boyhood
could
have
allowed
him
but
little
real
experience
with
this
*NL*
day
of
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickens
gave
his
first
formal
expression
to
his
Christmas
thoughts
in
*NL*
his
series
of
small
books
,
the
first
of
which
was
the
famous
``
Christmas
*NL*
Carol
,
''
the
one
perfect
chrysolite
.
The
success
of
the
book
was
*NL*
immediate
.
Thackeray
wrote
of
it
:
``
Who
can
listen
to
objections
*NL*
regarding
such
a
book
as
this
?
It
seems
to
me
a
national
benefit
,
and
to
*NL*
every
man
or
woman
who
reads
it
,
a
personal
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
volume
was
put
forth
in
a
very
attractive
manner
,
with
*NL*
illustrations
by
John
Leech
,
who
was
the
first
artist
to
make
these
*NL*
characters
live
,
and
his
drawings
were
varied
and
spirited
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
followed
upon
this
four
others
:
``
The
Chimes
,
''
``
The
Cricket
on
the
*NL*
Hearth
,
''
``
The
Battle
of
Life
,
''
and
``
The
Haunted
Man
,
''
with
illustrations
*NL*
on
their
first
appearance
by
Doyle
,
Maclise
,
and
others
.
The
five
are
*NL*
known
to-day
as
the
``
Christmas
Books
.
''
Of
them
all
the
``
Carol
''
is
the
*NL*
best
known
and
loved
,
and
``
The
Cricket
on
the
Hearth
,
''
although
third
in
*NL*
the
series
,
is
perhaps
next
in
point
of
popularity
,
and
is
especially
*NL*
familiar
to
Americans
through
Joseph
Jefferson
's
characterisation
of
*NL*
Caleb
Plummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickens
seems
to
have
put
his
whole
self
into
these
glowing
little
*NL*
stories
.
Whoever
sees
but
a
clever
ghost
story
in
the
``
Christmas
Carol
''
*NL*
misses
its
chief
charm
and
lesson
,
for
there
is
a
different
meaning
in
*NL*
the
movements
of
Scrooge
and
his
attendant
spirits
.
A
new
life
is
*NL*
brought
to
Scrooge
when
he
,
``
running
to
his
window
,
opened
it
and
put
*NL*
out
his
head
.
No
fog
,
no
mist
;
clear
,
bright
,
jovial
,
stirring
cold
;
*NL*
cold
,
piping
for
the
blood
to
dance
to
;
Golden
sun-light
;
Heavenly
sky
;
*NL*
sweet
fresh
air
;
merry
bells
.
Oh
,
glorious
!
Glorious
!
''
All
this
*NL*
brightness
has
its
attendant
shadow
,
and
deep
from
the
childish
heart
*NL*
comes
that
true
note
of
pathos
,
the
ever
memorable
toast
of
Tiny
Tim
,
*NL*
``
God
bless
Us
,
Every
One
!
''
``
The
Cricket
on
the
Hearth
''
strikes
a
*NL*
different
note
.
Charmingly
,
poetically
,
the
sweet
chirping
of
the
little
*NL*
cricket
is
associated
with
human
feelings
and
actions
,
and
at
the
crisis
*NL*
of
the
story
decides
the
fate
and
fortune
of
the
carrier
and
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickens
's
greatest
gift
was
characterization
,
and
no
English
writer
,
*NL*
save
Shakespeare
,
has
drawn
so
many
and
so
varied
characters
.
It
would
*NL*
be
as
absurd
to
interpret
all
of
these
as
caricatures
as
to
deny
Dickens
*NL*
his
great
and
varied
powers
of
creation
.
Dickens
exaggerated
many
of
his
*NL*
comic
and
satirical
characters
,
as
was
his
right
,
for
caricature
and
*NL*
satire
are
very
closely
related
,
while
exaggeration
is
the
very
essence
*NL*
of
comedy
.
But
there
remains
a
host
of
characters
marked
by
humour
and
*NL*
pathos
.
Yet
the
pictorial
presentation
of
Dickens
's
characters
has
ever
*NL*
tended
toward
the
grotesque
.
The
interpretations
in
this
volume
aim
to
*NL*
eliminate
the
grosser
phases
of
the
caricature
in
favour
of
the
more
*NL*
human
.
If
the
interpretations
seem
novel
,
if
Scrooge
be
not
as
he
has
*NL*
been
pictured
,
it
is
because
a
more
human
Scrooge
was
desired
--
a
Scrooge
*NL*
not
wholly
bad
,
a
Scrooge
of
a
better
heart
,
a
Scrooge
to
whom
the
*NL*
resurrection
described
in
this
story
was
possible
.
It
has
been
the
*NL*
illustrator
's
whole
aim
to
make
these
people
live
in
some
form
more
*NL*
fully
consistent
with
their
types
.

STAVE
ONE
*NL*
*NL*
MARLEY
'S
GHOST
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marley
was
dead
,
to
begin
with
.
There
is
no
doubt
whatever
about
that
.
*NL*
The
register
of
his
burial
was
signed
by
the
clergyman
,
the
clerk
,
the
*NL*
undertaker
,
and
the
chief
mourner
.
Scrooge
signed
it
.
And
Scrooge
's
name
*NL*
was
good
upon
`
Change
for
anything
he
chose
to
put
his
hand
to
.
Old
*NL*
Marley
was
as
dead
as
a
door-nail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mind
!
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
I
know
,
of
my
own
knowledge
,
what
there
*NL*
is
particularly
dead
about
a
door-nail
.
I
might
have
been
inclined
,
*NL*
myself
,
to
regard
a
coffin-nail
as
the
deadest
piece
of
ironmongery
in
*NL*
the
trade
.
But
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors
is
in
the
simile
;
and
my
*NL*
unhallowed
hands
shall
not
disturb
it
,
or
the
Country
's
done
for
.
You
*NL*
will
,
therefore
,
permit
me
to
repeat
,
emphatically
,
that
Marley
was
as
*NL*
dead
as
a
door-nail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
knew
he
was
dead
?
Of
course
he
did
.
How
could
it
be
otherwise
?
*NL*
Scrooge
and
he
were
partners
for
I
do
n't
know
how
many
years
.
Scrooge
*NL*
was
his
sole
executor
,
his
sole
administrator
,
his
sole
assign
,
his
*NL*
sole
residuary
legatee
,
his
sole
friend
,
and
sole
mourner
.
And
even
*NL*
Scrooge
was
not
so
dreadfully
cut
up
by
the
sad
event
,
but
that
he
was
*NL*
an
excellent
man
of
business
on
the
very
day
of
the
funeral
,
and
*NL*
solemnised
it
with
an
undoubted
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mention
of
Marley
's
funeral
brings
me
back
to
the
point
I
started
*NL*
from
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
Marley
was
dead
.
This
must
be
distinctly
*NL*
understood
,
or
nothing
wonderful
can
come
of
the
story
I
am
going
to
*NL*
relate
.
If
we
were
not
perfectly
convinced
that
Hamlet
's
Father
died
*NL*
before
the
play
began
,
there
would
be
nothing
more
remarkable
in
his
*NL*
taking
a
stroll
at
night
,
in
an
easterly
wind
,
upon
his
own
ramparts
,
*NL*
than
there
would
be
in
any
other
middle-aged
gentleman
rashly
turning
*NL*
out
after
dark
in
a
breezy
spot
--
say
St.
Paul
's
Church-yard
,
for
*NL*
instance
--
literally
to
astonish
his
son
's
weak
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
never
painted
out
Old
Marley
's
name
.
There
it
stood
,
years
*NL*
afterwards
,
above
the
warehouse
door
:
Scrooge
and
Marley
.
The
firm
was
*NL*
known
as
Scrooge
and
Marley
.
Sometimes
people
new
to
the
business
called
*NL*
Scrooge
Scrooge
,
and
sometimes
Marley
,
but
he
answered
to
both
names
.
It
*NL*
was
all
the
same
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
but
he
was
a
tight-fisted
hand
at
the
grindstone
,
Scrooge
!
a
*NL*
squeezing
,
wrenching
,
grasping
,
scraping
,
clutching
,
covetous
,
old
*NL*
sinner
!
Hard
and
sharp
as
flint
,
from
which
no
steel
had
ever
struck
out
*NL*
generous
fire
;
secret
,
and
self-contained
,
and
solitary
as
an
oyster
.
*NL*
The
cold
within
him
froze
his
old
features
,
nipped
his
pointed
nose
,
*NL*
shrivelled
his
cheek
,
stiffened
his
gait
;
made
his
eyes
red
,
his
thin
*NL*
lips
blue
;
and
spoke
out
shrewdly
in
his
grating
voice
.
A
frosty
rime
*NL*
was
on
his
head
,
and
on
his
eyebrows
,
and
his
wiry
chin
.
He
carried
his
*NL*
own
low
temperature
always
about
with
him
;
he
iced
his
office
in
the
*NL*
dog-days
;
and
did
n't
thaw
it
one
degree
at
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
External
heat
and
cold
had
little
influence
on
Scrooge
.
No
warmth
could
*NL*
warm
,
no
wintry
weather
chill
him
.
No
wind
that
blew
was
bitterer
than
*NL*
he
,
no
falling
snow
was
more
intent
upon
its
purpose
,
no
pelting
rain
*NL*
less
open
to
entreaty
.
Foul
weather
did
n't
know
where
to
have
him
.
The
*NL*
heaviest
rain
,
and
snow
,
and
hail
,
and
sleet
could
boast
of
the
*NL*
advantage
over
him
in
only
one
respect
.
They
often
``
came
down
''
*NL*
handsomely
and
Scrooge
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
ever
stopped
him
in
the
street
to
say
,
with
gladsome
looks
,
``
My
*NL*
dear
Scrooge
,
how
are
you
?
When
will
you
come
to
see
me
?
''
No
beggars
*NL*
implored
him
to
bestow
a
trifle
,
no
children
asked
him
what
it
was
*NL*
o'clock
,
no
man
or
woman
ever
once
in
all
his
life
inquired
the
way
to
*NL*
such
and
such
a
place
,
of
Scrooge
.
Even
the
blind
men
's
dogs
appeared
to
*NL*
know
him
;
and
,
when
they
saw
him
coming
on
,
would
tug
their
owners
into
*NL*
doorways
and
up
courts
;
and
then
would
wag
their
tails
as
though
they
*NL*
said
,
``
No
eye
at
all
is
better
than
an
evil
eye
,
dark
master
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
did
Scrooge
care
?
It
was
the
very
thing
he
liked
.
To
edge
his
*NL*
way
along
the
crowded
paths
of
life
,
warning
all
human
sympathy
to
keep
*NL*
its
distance
,
was
what
the
knowing
ones
call
``
nuts
''
to
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
upon
a
time
--
of
all
the
good
days
in
the
year
,
on
Christmas
*NL*
Eve
--
old
Scrooge
sat
busy
in
his
counting-house
.
It
was
cold
,
bleak
,
*NL*
biting
weather
:
foggy
withal
:
and
he
could
hear
the
people
in
the
court
*NL*
outside
go
wheezing
up
and
down
,
beating
their
hands
upon
their
breasts
,
*NL*
and
stamping
their
feet
upon
the
pavement
stones
to
warm
them
.
The
City
*NL*
clocks
had
only
just
gone
three
,
but
it
was
quite
dark
already
--
it
had
*NL*
not
been
light
all
day
--
and
candles
were
flaring
in
the
windows
of
the
*NL*
neighbouring
offices
,
like
ruddy
smears
upon
the
palpable
brown
air
.
The
*NL*
fog
came
pouring
in
at
every
chink
and
keyhole
,
and
was
so
dense
*NL*
without
,
that
,
although
the
court
was
of
the
narrowest
,
the
houses
*NL*
opposite
were
mere
phantoms
.
To
see
the
dingy
cloud
come
drooping
down
,
*NL*
obscuring
everything
,
one
might
have
thought
that
nature
lived
hard
by
*NL*
and
was
brewing
on
a
large
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
Scrooge
's
counting-house
was
open
,
that
he
might
keep
his
*NL*
eye
upon
his
clerk
,
who
in
a
dismal
little
cell
beyond
,
a
sort
of
tank
,
*NL*
was
copying
letters
.
Scrooge
had
a
very
small
fire
,
but
the
clerk
's
fire
*NL*
was
so
very
much
smaller
that
it
looked
like
one
coal
.
But
he
could
n't
*NL*
replenish
it
,
for
Scrooge
kept
the
coal-box
in
his
own
room
;
and
so
*NL*
surely
as
the
clerk
came
in
with
the
shovel
,
the
master
predicted
that
*NL*
it
would
be
necessary
for
them
to
part
.
Wherefore
the
clerk
put
on
his
*NL*
white
comforter
,
and
tried
to
warm
himself
at
the
candle
;
in
which
*NL*
effort
,
not
being
a
man
of
strong
imagination
,
he
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
merry
Christmas
,
uncle
!
God
save
you
!
''
cried
a
cheerful
voice
.
It
was
*NL*
the
voice
of
Scrooge
's
nephew
,
who
came
upon
him
so
quickly
that
this
*NL*
was
the
first
intimation
he
had
of
his
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
Humbug
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
so
heated
himself
with
rapid
walking
in
the
fog
and
frost
,
this
*NL*
nephew
of
Scrooge
's
,
that
he
was
all
in
a
glow
;
his
face
was
ruddy
and
*NL*
handsome
;
his
eyes
sparkled
,
and
his
breath
smoked

I
dare

returned
the

;
``
Christmas
among
*NL*
the
rest

But
I
am
sure
I
have
always
thought
of
Christmas-time
,
when
it
*NL*
has
come
round
--
apart
from
the
veneration
due
to
its
sacred
name
and
*NL*
origin
,
if
anything
belonging
to
it
can
be
apart
from
that
--
as
a
good
*NL*
time
;
a
kind
,
forgiving
,
charitable
,
pleasant
time
;
the
only
time
I
know
*NL*
of
,
in
the
long
calendar
of
the
year
,
when
men
and
women
seem
by
one
*NL*
consent
to
open
their
shut-up
hearts
freely
,
and
to
think
of
people
*NL*
below
them
as
if
they
really
were
fellow-passengers
to
the
grave
,
and
*NL*
not
another
race
of
creatures
bound
on
other
journeys
.
And
therefore
,
*NL*
uncle
,
though
it
has
never
put
a
scrap
of
gold
or
silver
in
my
pocket

I
*NL*
believe
that
it

has
_
done
me
good

will
_
do
me
good

I
say
,
*NL*
God
bless
it

*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
in
the
tank
involuntarily
applauded
.
Becoming
immediately
*NL*
sensible
of
the
impropriety
,
he
poked
the
fire
,
and
extinguished
the
*NL*
last
frail
spark
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
hear
another
sound
from
_
you

Scrooge

you
'll

*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
said
that
he
would
see
him
--
Yes
,
indeed
he
did

He
went
the
*NL*
whole
length
of
the
expression
,
and
said
that
he
would
see
him
in
that
*NL*
extremity
first

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Scrooge

*NL*

Scrooge

as
if
that
were
the
only

one
thing
in
the

more
ridiculous
than
a
merry
Christmas

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

you

A

*NL*
*NL*

said
Scrooge

*NL*
*NL*
His
nephew
left
the
room
without
an
angry
word
,
notwithstanding
.
He
*NL*
stopped
at
the
outer
door
to
bestow
the
greetings
of
the
season
on
the
*NL*
clerk
,
who
,
cold
as
he
was
,
was
warmer
than
Scrooge
;
for
he
returned
*NL*
them
cordially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
another
fellow
,
''
muttered
Scrooge
,
who
overheard
him
:
``
my
*NL*
clerk
,
with
fifteen
shillings
a
week
,
and
a
wife

family

talking
*NL*
about

merry
Christmas

I
'll
retire
to
Bedlam

*NL*
*NL*
This
lunatic
,
in
letting
Scrooge
's
nephew
out
,
had
let
two
other
people
*NL*
in
.
They
were
portly
gentlemen
,
pleasant
to
behold
,
and
now
stood
,
with
*NL*
their
hats
off
,
in
Scrooge
's
office
.
They
had
books
and
papers
in
their
*NL*
hands
,
and
bowed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scrooge
and
Marley
's
,
I
believe
,
''
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
referring
*NL*
to
his
list
.
``
Have
I
the
pleasure
of
addressing
Mr.
Scrooge

Mr.
*NL*
Marley

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Marley
has
been
dead
these
seven
years

''
Scrooge
replied
.
``
He
died
*NL*
seven
years
ago

this
very
night

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
no
doubt
his
liberality

well
represented
by
his
surviving
*NL*
partner

said
the
gentleman
,
presenting
his
credentials
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
was
;
for
they
had
been
two
kindred
spirits
.
At
the
ominous
*NL*
word
``
liberality
''
Scrooge
frowned
,
and
shook
his
head
,
and
handed
the
*NL*
credentials
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
festive
season
of
the
year

Mr.
Scrooge

said
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
taking
up
a
pen
,
``
it
is
more
than
usually
desirable

greatly

asked
Scrooge

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

laying
down
the
pen
again

*NL*
*NL*

demanded
Scrooge

Are

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

Scrooge

*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
very
busy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
was
afraid

from
what
you
said
at
first

that
something
had
*NL*
occurred
to

them
in
their
useful
course

said
Scrooge
.
``
I
am
very
*NL*
glad
to
hear
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
impression
that
they
scarcely
furnish
Christian
cheer
of
mind
*NL*
or
body
to
the
multitude

returned
the
gentleman
,
``
a
few
of
us
are

endeavouring
to
raise
a
fund
to
buy
the

some
meat

*NL*
means
of
warmth

We
choose
this

because
it
is
a
time

of
all

others

when
Want

keenly
felt

Abundance
rejoices

What
shall
I

put
you
down
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

Scrooge

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

anonymous

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Scrooge

``
Since
you
ask
me
what
I

*NL*
gentlemen

that
is
my
answer

I
do
n't
make
merry
myself
at
Christmas
,
*NL*
and
I
ca
n't
afford
to
make
idle
people
merry

I
help
to
support
the
*NL*
establishments
I
have
mentioned
--
they
cost
enough
;

those
who
are
*NL*
badly
off
must
go
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
ca

go
there

many
would
rather
die

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

said
Scrooge
,
``
they
had
better
do

decrease

*NL*
*NL*

observed
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not

Scrooge
returned

``
It

enough
for

understand
his

's
.
*NL*
Mine
occupies
me
constantly

Good
afternoon

gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
clearly
that
it
would
be
useless
to
pursue
their
point
,
the
*NL*
gentlemen
withdrew
.
Scrooge
resumed
his
labours
with
an
improved
opinion
*NL*
of
himself
,
and
in
a
more
facetious
temper
than
was
usual
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
fog
and
darkness
thickened
so
,
that
people
ran
about
with
*NL*
flaring
links
,
proffering
their
services
to
go
before
horses
in
*NL*
carriages
,
and
conduct
them
on
their
way
.
The
ancient
tower
of
a
church
,
*NL*
whose
gruff
old
bell
was
always
peeping
slily
down
at
Scrooge
out
of
a
*NL*
Gothic
window
in
the
wall
,
became
invisible
,
and
struck
the
hours
and
*NL*
quarters
in
the
clouds
,
with
tremulous
vibrations
afterwards
,
as
if
its
*NL*
teeth
were
chattering
in
its
frozen
head
up
there
.
The
cold
became
*NL*
intense
.
In
the
main
street
,
at
the
corner
of
the
court
,
some
labourers
*NL*
were
repairing
the
gas-pipes
,
and
had
lighted
a
great
fire
in
a
brazier
,
*NL*
round
which
a
party
of
ragged
men
and
boys
were
gathered
:
warming
their
*NL*
hands
and
winking
their
eyes
before
the
blaze
in
rapture
.
The
water-plug
*NL*
being
left
in
solitude
,
its
overflowings
suddenly
congealed
,
and
turned
*NL*
to
misanthropic
ice
.
The
brightness
of
the
shops
,
where
holly
sprigs
and
*NL*
berries
crackled
in
the
lamp
heat
of
the
windows
,
made
pale
faces
ruddy
*NL*
as
they
passed
.
Poulterers
'
and
grocers
'
trades
became
a
splendid
joke
:
*NL*
a
glorious
pageant
,
with
which
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
believe
that
*NL*
such
dull
principles
as
bargain
and
sale
had
anything
to
do
.
The
Lord
*NL*
Mayor
,
in
the
stronghold
of
the
mighty
Mansion
House
,
gave
orders
to
his
*NL*
fifty
cooks
and
butlers
to
keep
Christmas
as
a
Lord
Mayor
's
household
*NL*
should
;
and
even
the
little
tailor
,
whom
he
had
fined
five
shillings
on
*NL*
the
previous
Monday
for
being
drunk
and
blood-thirsty
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
stirred
up
to-morrow
's
pudding
in
his
garret
,
while
his
lean
wife
and
*NL*
the
baby
sallied
out
to
buy
the
beef
.
*NL*
*NL*
Foggier
yet
,
and
colder
!
Piercing
,
searching
,
biting
cold
.
If
the
good
*NL*
St.
Dunstan
had
but
nipped
the
Evil
Spirit
's
nose
with
a
touch
of
such
*NL*
weather
as
that
,
instead
of
using
his
familiar
weapons
,
then
indeed
he
*NL*
would
have
roared
to
lusty
purpose
.
The
owner
of
one
scant
young
nose
,
*NL*
gnawed
and
mumbled
by
the
hungry
cold
as
bones
are
gnawed
by
dogs
,
*NL*
stooped
down
at
Scrooge
's
keyhole
to
regale
him
with
a
Christmas
carol
;
*NL*
but
,
at
the
first
sound
of
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
merry
gentleman
,
*NL*
May
nothing
you
dismay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
seized
the
ruler
with
such
energy
of
action
,
that
the
singer
*NL*
fled
in
terror
,
leaving
the
keyhole
to
the
fog
,
and
even
more
congenial
*NL*
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
hour
of
shutting
up
the
counting-house
arrived
.
With
an
*NL*
ill-will
Scrooge
dismounted
from
his
stool
,
and
tacitly
admitted
the
*NL*
fact
to
the
expectant
clerk
in
the
tank
,
who
instantly
snuffed
his
*NL*
candle
out
,
and
put
on
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
want
all
day
to-morrow
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
quite
convenient
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
convenient
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
and
it
's
not
fair
.
If
I
was
to
*NL*
stop
half-a-crown
for
it
,
you
'd
think
yourself
ill
used
,
I
'll
be
bound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
smiled
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
you
do
n't
think

me

used
when
I
pay
a
*NL*
day
's
wages
for
no
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
observed
that
it
was
only
once
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
poor
excuse
for
picking
a
man
's
pocket
every
twenty-fifth
of
*NL*
December
!
''
said
Scrooge
,
buttoning
his
great-coat
to
the
chin
.
``
But
I
*NL*
suppose
you
must
have
the
whole
day
.
Be
here
all
the
earlier
next
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
promised
that
he
would
;
and
Scrooge
walked
out
with
a
growl
.
*NL*
The
office
was
closed
in
a
twinkling
,
and
the
clerk
,
with
the
long
ends
*NL*
of
his
white
comforter
dangling
below
his
waist
-LRB-
for
he
boasted
no
*NL*
great-coat
-RRB-
,
went
down
a
slide
on
Cornhill
,
at
the
end
of
a
lane
of
*NL*
boys
,
twenty
times
,
in
honour
of
its
being
Christmas-eve
,
and
then
ran
*NL*
home
to
Camden
Town
as
hard
as
he
could
pelt
,
to
play
at
blindman
's
*NL*
buff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
took
his
melancholy
dinner
in
his
usual
melancholy
tavern
;
and
*NL*
having
read
all
the
newspapers
,
and
beguiled
the
rest
of
the
evening
*NL*
with
his
banker
's
book
,
went
home
to
bed
.
He
lived
in
chambers
which
had
*NL*
once
belonged
to
his
deceased
partner
.
They
were
a
gloomy
suite
of
*NL*
rooms
,
in
a
lowering
pile
of
building
up
a
yard
,
where
it
had
so
little
*NL*
business
to
be
,
that
one
could
scarcely
help
fancying
it
must
have
run
*NL*
there
when
it
was
a
young
house
,
playing
at
hide-and-seek
with
other
*NL*
houses
,
and
have
forgotten
the
way
out
again
.
It
was
old
enough
now
,
and
*NL*
dreary
enough
;
for
nobody
lived
in
it
but
Scrooge
,
the
other
rooms
being
*NL*
all
let
out
as
offices
.
The
yard
was
so
dark
that
even
Scrooge
,
who
*NL*
knew
its
every
stone
,
was
fain
to
grope
with
his
hands
.
The
fog
and
*NL*
frost
so
hung
about
the
black
old
gateway
of
the
house
,
that
it
seemed
*NL*
as
if
the
Genius
of
the
Weather
sat
in
mournful
meditation
on
the
*NL*
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
is
a
fact
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
particular
about
the
*NL*
knocker
on
the
door
,
except
that
it
was
very
large
.
It
is
also
a
fact
*NL*
that
Scrooge
had
seen
it
,
night
and
morning
,
during
his
whole
residence
*NL*
in
that
place
;
also
that
Scrooge
had
as
little
of
what
is
called
fancy
*NL*
about
him
as
any
man
in
the
City
of
London
,
even
including
--
which
is
a
*NL*
bold
word
--
the
corporation
,
aldermen
,
and
livery
.
Let
it
also
be
borne
*NL*
in
mind
that
Scrooge
had
not
bestowed
one
thought
on
Marley
since
his
*NL*
last
mention
of
his
seven-years
'
-
dead
partner
that
afternoon
.
And
then
*NL*
let
any
man
explain
to
me
,
if
he
can
,
how
it
happened
that
Scrooge
,
*NL*
having
his
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
,
saw
in
the
knocker
,
without
its
*NL*
undergoing
any
intermediate
process
of
change
--
not
a
knocker
,
but
*NL*
Marley
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marley
's
face
.
It
was
not
in
impenetrable
shadow
,
as
the
other
objects
*NL*
in
the
yard
were
,
but
had
a
dismal
light
about
it
,
like
a
bad
lobster
in
*NL*
a
dark
cellar
.
It
was
not
angry
or
ferocious
,
but
looked
at
Scrooge
as
*NL*
Marley
used
to
look
:
with
ghostly
spectacles
turned
up
on
its
ghostly
*NL*
forehead
.
The
hair
was
curiously
stirred
,
as
if
by
breath
of
hot
air
;
*NL*
and
,
though
the
eyes
were
wide
open
,
they
were
perfectly
motionless
.
*NL*
That
,
and
its
livid
colour
,
made
it
horrible
;
but
its
horror
seemed
to
*NL*
be
in
spite
of
the
face
,
and
beyond
its
control
,
rather
than
a
part
of
*NL*
its
own
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Scrooge
looked
fixedly
at
this
phenomenon
,
it
was
a
knocker
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
that
he
was
not
startled
,
or
that
his
blood
was
not
conscious
of
*NL*
a
terrible
sensation
to
which
it
had
been
a
stranger
from
infancy
,
would
*NL*
be
untrue
.
But
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
key
he
had
relinquished
,
turned
*NL*
it
sturdily
,
walked
in
,
and
lighted
his
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
_
did
_
pause
,
with
a
moment
's
irresolution
,
before
he
shut
the
door
;
*NL*
and
he
_
did
_
look
cautiously
behind
it
first
,
as
if
he
half
expected
to
*NL*
be
terrified
with
the
sight
of
Marley
's
pigtail
sticking
out
into
the
*NL*
hall
.
But
there
was
nothing
on
the
back
of
the
door
,
except
the
screws
*NL*
and
nuts
that
held
the
knocker
on
,
so
he
said
,
``
Pooh
,
pooh
!
''
and
closed
*NL*
it
with
a
bang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
resounded
through
the
house
like
thunder
.
Every
room
above
,
*NL*
and
every
cask
in
the
wine
merchant
's
cellars
below
,
appeared
to
have
a
*NL*
separate
peal
of
echoes
of
its
own
.
Scrooge
was
not
a
man
to
be
*NL*
frightened
by
echoes
.
He
fastened
the
door
,
and
walked
across
the
hall
,
*NL*
and
up
the
stairs
:
slowly
,
too
:
trimming
his
candle
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
talk
vaguely
about
driving
a
coach
and
six
up
a
good
old
flight
*NL*
of
stairs
,
or
through
a
bad
young
Act
of
Parliament
;
but
I
mean
to
say
*NL*
you
might
have
got
a
hearse
up
that
staircase
,
and
taken
it
broadwise
,
*NL*
with
the
splinter-bar
towards
the
wall
,
and
the
door
towards
the
*NL*
balustrades
:
and
done
it
easy
.
There
was
plenty
of
width
for
that
,
and
*NL*
room
to
spare
;
which
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
Scrooge
thought
he
saw
a
*NL*
locomotive
hearse
going
on
before
him
in
the
gloom
.
Half-a-dozen
*NL*
gas-lamps
out
of
the
street
would
n't
have
lighted
the
entry
too
well
,
so
*NL*
you
may
suppose
that
it
was
pretty
dark
with
Scrooge
's
dip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
Scrooge
went
,
not
caring
a
button
for
that
.
Darkness
is
cheap
,
and
*NL*
Scrooge
liked
it
.
But
,
before
he
shut
his
heavy
door
,
he
walked
through
*NL*
his
rooms
to
see
that
all
was
right
.
He
had
just
enough
recollection
of
*NL*
the
face
to
desire
to
do
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting-room
,
bedroom
,
lumber-room
.
All
as
they
should
be
.
Nobody
under
*NL*
the
table
,
nobody
under
the
sofa
;
a
small
fire
in
the
grate
;
spoon
and
*NL*
basin
ready
;
and
the
little
saucepan
of
gruel
-LRB-
Scrooge
had
a
cold
in
his
*NL*
head
-RRB-
upon
the
hob
.
Nobody
under
the
bed
;
nobody
in
the
closet
;
nobody
*NL*
in
his
dressing-gown
,
which
was
hanging
up
in
a
suspicious
attitude
*NL*
against
the
wall
.
Lumber-room
as
usual
.
Old
fire-guard
,
old
shoes
,
two
*NL*
fish
baskets
,
washing-stand
on
three
legs
,
and
a
poker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
satisfied
,
he
closed
his
door
,
and
locked
himself
in
;
double
*NL*
locked
himself
in
,
which
was
not
his
custom
.
Thus
secured
against
*NL*
surprise
,
he
took
off
his
cravat
;
put
on
his
dressing-gown
and
slippers
,
*NL*
and
his
nightcap
;
and
sat
down
before
the
fire
to
take
his
gruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
low
fire
indeed
;
nothing
on
such
a
bitter
night
.
He
was
*NL*
obliged
to
sit
close
to
it
,
and
brood
over
it
,
before
he
could
extract
*NL*
the
least
sensation
of
warmth
from
such
a
handful
of
fuel
.
The
*NL*
fire-place
was
an
old
one
,
built
by
some
Dutch
merchant
long
ago
,
and
*NL*
paved
all
round
with
quaint
Dutch
tiles
,
designed
to
illustrate
the
*NL*
Scriptures
.
There
were
Cains
and
Abels
,
Pharaoh
's
daughters
,
Queens
of
*NL*
Sheba
,
Angelic
messengers
descending
through
the
air
on
clouds
like
*NL*
feather
beds
,
Abrahams
,
Belshazzars
,
Apostles
putting
off
to
sea
in
*NL*
butter-boats
,
hundreds
of
figures
to
attract
his
thoughts
;
and
yet
that
*NL*
face
of
Marley
,
seven
years
dead
,
came
like
the
ancient
Prophet
's
rod
,
*NL*
and
swallowed
up
the
whole
.
If
each
smooth
tile
had
been
a
blank
at
*NL*
first
,
with
power
to
shape
some
picture
on
its
surface
from
the
*NL*
disjointed
fragments
of
his
thoughts
,
there
would
have
been
a
copy
of
*NL*
old
Marley
's
head
on
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humbug
!
''
said
Scrooge
;
and
walked
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
several
turns
he
sat
down
again
.
As
he
threw
his
head
back
in
the
*NL*
chair
,
his
glance
happened
to
rest
upon
a
bell
,
a
disused
bell
,
that
*NL*
hung
in
the
room
,
and
communicated
,
for
some
purpose
now
forgotten
,
with
*NL*
a
chamber
in
the
highest
story
of
the
building
.
It
was
with
great
*NL*
astonishment
,
and
with
a
strange
,
inexplicable
dread
,
that
,
as
he
*NL*
looked
,
he
saw
this
bell
begin
to
swing
.
It
swung
so
softly
in
the
*NL*
outset
that
it
scarcely
made
a
sound
;
but
soon
it
rang
out
loudly
,
and
*NL*
so
did
every
bell
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
might
have
lasted
half
a
minute
,
or
a
minute
,
but
it
seemed
an
*NL*
hour
.
The
bells
ceased
,
as
they
had
begun
,
together
.
They
were
succeeded
*NL*
by
a
clanking
noise
,
deep
down
below
,
as
if
some
person
were
dragging
a
*NL*
heavy
chain
over
the
casks
in
the
wine
merchant
's
cellar
.
Scrooge
then
*NL*
remembered
to
have
heard
that
ghosts
in
haunted
houses
were
described
as
*NL*
dragging
chains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cellar
door
flew
open
with
a
booming
sound
,
and
then
he
heard
the
*NL*
noise
much
louder
on
the
floors
below
;
then
coming
up
the
stairs
;
then
*NL*
coming
straight
towards
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
humbug
still
!
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
I
wo
n't
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
colour
changed
,
though
,
when
,
without
a
pause
,
it
came
on
through
*NL*
the
heavy
door
,
and
passed
into
the
room
before
his
eyes
.
Upon
its
*NL*
coming
in
,
the
dying
flame
leaped
up
,
as
though
it
cried
,
``
I
know
him
!
*NL*
Marley
's
Ghost
!
''
and
fell
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
face
:
the
very
same
.
Marley
in
his
pigtail
,
usual
waistcoat
,
*NL*
tights
,
and
boots
;
the
tassels
on
the
latter
bristling
,
like
his
*NL*
pigtail
,
and
his
coat-skirts
,
and
the
hair
upon
his
head
.
The
chain
he
*NL*
drew
was
clasped
about
his
middle
.
It
was
long
,
and
wound
about
him
like
*NL*
a
tail
;
and
it
was
made
-LRB-
for
Scrooge
observed
it
closely
-RRB-
of
cash-boxes
,
*NL*
keys
,
padlocks
,
ledgers
,
deeds
,
and
heavy
purses
wrought
in
steel
.
His
*NL*
body
was
transparent
;
so
that
Scrooge
,
observing
him
,
and
looking
*NL*
through
his
waistcoat
,
could
see
the
two
buttons
on
his
coat
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
had
often
heard
it
said
that
Marley
had
no
bowels
,
but
he
had
*NL*
never
believed
it
until
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
nor
did
he
believe
it
even
now
.
Though
he
looked
the
phantom
through
*NL*
and
through
,
and
saw
it
standing
before
him
;
though
he
felt
the
chilling
*NL*
influence
of
its
death-cold
eyes
;
and
marked
the
very
texture
of
the
*NL*
folded
kerchief
bound
about
its
head
and
chin
,
which
wrapper
he
had
not
*NL*
observed
before
;
he
was
still
incredulous
,
and
fought
against
his
*NL*
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
now
!
''
said
Scrooge
,
caustic
and
cold
as
ever
.
``
What
do
you
want
*NL*
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
!
''
--
Marley
's
voice
,
no
doubt
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
me
who
I
_
was
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
_
were
_
you
,
then
?
''
said
Scrooge
,
raising
his
voice
.
``
You
're
*NL*
particular
,
for
a
shade
.
''
He
was
going
to
say
''
_
to
_
a
shade
,
''
but
*NL*
substituted
this
,
as
more
appropriate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
life
I
was
your
partner
,
Jacob
Marley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
--
can
you
sit
down
?
''
asked
Scrooge
,
looking
doubtfully
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
it
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
asked
the
question
,
because
he
did
n't
know
whether
a
ghost
so
*NL*
transparent
might
find
himself
in
a
condition
to
take
a
chair
;
and
felt
*NL*
that
,
in
the
event
of
its
being
impossible
,
it
might
involve
the
*NL*
necessity
of
an
embarrassing
explanation
.
But
the
Ghost
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
opposite
side
of
the
fire-place
,
as
if
he
were
quite
used
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
believe
in
me
,
''
observed
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
evidence
would
you
have
of
my
reality
beyond
that
of
your
own
*NL*
senses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
doubt
your
senses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
a
little
thing
affects
them
.
A
slight
disorder
*NL*
of
the
stomach
makes
them
cheats
.
You
may
be
an
undigested
bit
of
beef
,
*NL*
a
blot
of
mustard
,
a
crumb
of
cheese
,
a
fragment
of
an
underdone
potato
.
*NL*
There
's
more
of
gravy
than
of
grave
about
you
,
whatever
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
was
not
much
in
the
habit
of
cracking
jokes
,
nor
did
he
feel
in
*NL*
his
heart
by
any
means
waggish
then
.
The
truth
is
,
that
he
tried
to
be
*NL*
smart
,
as
a
means
of
distracting
his
own
attention
,
and
keeping
down
his
*NL*
terror
;
for
the
spectre
's
voice
disturbed
the
very
marrow
in
his
bones
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
sit
staring
at
those
fixed
glazed
eyes
in
silence
,
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
would
play
,
Scrooge
felt
,
the
very
deuce
with
him
.
There
was
something
*NL*
very
awful
,
too
,
in
the
spectre
's
being
provided
with
an
infernal
*NL*
atmosphere
of
his
own
.
Scrooge
could
not
feel
it
himself
,
but
this
was
*NL*
clearly
the
case
;
for
though
the
Ghost
sat
perfectly
motionless
,
its
*NL*
hair
,
and
skirts
,
and
tassels
were
still
agitated
as
by
the
hot
vapour
*NL*
from
an
oven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
this
toothpick
?
''
said
Scrooge
,
returning
quickly
to
the
charge
,
*NL*
for
the
reason
just
assigned
;
and
wishing
,
though
it
were
only
for
a
*NL*
second
,
to
divert
the
vision
's
stony
gaze
from
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
replied
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
looking
at
it
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
see
it
,
''
said
the
Ghost
,
``
notwithstanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
returned
Scrooge
,
``
I
have
but
to
swallow
this
,
and
be
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
my
days
persecuted
by
a
legion
of
goblins
,
all
of
my
own
*NL*
creation
.
Humbug
,
I
tell
you
;
humbug
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
spirit
raised
a
frightful
cry
,
and
shook
its
chain
with
such
*NL*
a
dismal
and
appalling
noise
,
that
Scrooge
held
on
tight
to
his
chair
,
*NL*
to
save
himself
from
falling
in
a
swoon
.
But
how
much
greater
was
his
*NL*
horror
when
the
phantom
,
taking
off
the
bandage
round
his
head
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
too
warm
to
wear
indoors
,
its
lower
jaw
dropped
down
upon
its
*NL*
breast
!
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
clasped
his
hands
before
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
''
he
said
.
``
Dreadful
apparition
,
why
do
you
trouble
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
of
the
worldly
mind
!
''
replied
the
Ghost
,
``
do
you
believe
in
me
or
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
I
must
.
But
why
do
spirits
walk
the
earth
,

*NL*
why
do
they
come
to
me

*NL*
``

Again
the

raised
a

shook
its

wrung
its

shadowy

*NL*
*NL*

Scrooge

trembling

*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
trembled
more

more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

pursued
the

``
the
weight

seven

*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
glanced
about
him
on
the
floor
,
in
the
expectation
of
finding
*NL*
himself
surrounded
by
some
fifty
or
sixty
fathoms
of
iron
cable
,
but
he
*NL*
could
see
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jacob

he
said
imploringly
.
``
Old
Jacob

tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
none
to
give

the
Ghost
replied
.
``
It
comes
from

conveyed

Nor
can
I
tell

A

permitted

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
habit
with
Scrooge
,
whenever
he
became
thoughtful
,
to
put
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
.
Pondering
on
what
the
Ghost
had
said
,
he
*NL*
did
so
now
,
but
without
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
or
getting
off
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
been
very
slow
about

Jacob

''
Scrooge
observed
in
a
*NL*
business-like
manner
,
though
with
humility
and
deference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slow
!
''
the
Ghost
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
years
dead

mused
Scrooge
.
``
And
travelling
all
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole

''
said
the

``
No

Incessant
torture

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Scrooge

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

replied
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

have
got
over

''
*NL*
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
,
on
hearing
this
,
set
up
another
cry
,
and
clanked
its
chain
so
*NL*
hideously
in
the
dead
silence
of
the
night
,
that
the
Ward
would
have
*NL*
been
justified
in
indicting
it
for
a
nuisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
captive
,
bound
,
and
double-ironed
,
''
cried
the
phantom
,
``
not
to
know
*NL*
that
ages

incessant
labour

by
immortal
creatures

for
this
earth

pass
into
eternity
before
the
good
of

all

Not

any
Christian
spirit
working
kindly
in

its
little
sphere
,
whatever
it
may
be

will
find
its
mortal
life
too

short
for

vast
means

Not

no

make

one
life

Yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
were
always
a
good

business

Jacob

faltered
Scrooge
,
*NL*
who
now
began
to
apply
this
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Business
!
''
cried
the
Ghost
,
wringing
its
hands
again
.
``
Mankind
was
my
*NL*
business

The
common
welfare
was
my
business

charity

mercy

and
benevolence
were
,
all
,
my
business

The
dealings
of
my
*NL*
trade
were
but
a
drop
of
water
in
the
comprehensive
ocean
of
my
*NL*
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
held
up
its
chain
at
arm
's
length
,
as
if
that
were
the
cause
of
all
*NL*
its
unavailing
grief
,
and
flung
it
heavily
upon
the
ground
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
time
of
the
rolling
year
,
''
the
spectre
said
,
``
I
suffer
most

*NL*
Why
did
I
walk
through
crowds
of
fellow-beings
with
my
eyes
turned
down

and
never
raise
them
to
that
blessed
Star

led
the
Wise

poor
abode

Were
there
no
poor
homes

which
its
light
would
have
*NL*
conducted
_
me

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
was
very
much
dismayed
to
hear
the
spectre
going
on
at
this
*NL*
rate
,
and
began
to
quake
exceedingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
me
!
''
cried
the
Ghost
.
``
My
time
is
nearly
gone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
But
do
n't
be
hard
upon
me
!
Do
n't
be
flowery
,
*NL*
Jacob
!
Pray
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
it
is
that
I
appear
before
you

you

see

I
may
*NL*
not

I
have
sat
invisible
beside
you
many
and
many
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
an
agreeable
idea
.
Scrooge
shivered
,
and
wiped
the
*NL*
perspiration
from
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
no
light
part

pursued
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Scrooge

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
haunted

resumed
the
Ghost
,
``
by
Three
Spirits

''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
's
countenance
fell
almost
as
low
as
the
Ghost
's
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
chance

hope
you
mentioned

he
demanded
in
a
*NL*
faltering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

--
I
think
I
'd
rather
not

''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
their
visits

''
said
the
Ghost
,
``
you
can
not
hope
to
shun
the
*NL*
path
I
tread
.
Expect
the
first
to-morrow
when
the
bell
tolls
One

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
I
take
'em
all
at
once
,
and
have
it
over
,
Jacob
?
''
hinted
*NL*
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Expect
the
second

night

the
last
stroke
of

has
ceased
to

*NL*
Look

me
no
more
;
and
look
that

for
your
own
sake
,
you
remember
*NL*
what
has
passed
between

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
had
said
these
words
,
the
spectre
took
its
wrapper
from
the
*NL*
table
,
and
bound
it
round
its
head
as
before
.
Scrooge
knew
this
by
the
*NL*
smart
sound
its
teeth
made
when
the
jaws
were
brought
together
by
the
*NL*
bandage
.
He
ventured
to
raise
his
eyes
again
,
and
found
his
supernatural
*NL*
visitor
confronting
him
in
an
erect
attitude
,
with
its
chain
wound
over
*NL*
and
about
its
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apparition
walked
backward
from
him
;
and
,
at
every
step
it
took
,
the
*NL*
window
raised
itself
a
little
,
so
that
,
when
the
spectre
reached
it
,
it
*NL*
was
wide
open
.
It
beckoned
Scrooge
to
approach
,
which
he
did
.
When
they
*NL*
were
within
two
paces
of
each
other
,
Marley
's
Ghost
held
up
its
hand
,
*NL*
warning
him
to
come
no
nearer
.
Scrooge
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
much
in
obedience
as
in
surprise
and
fear
;
for
,
on
the
raising
of
*NL*
the
hand
,
he
became
sensible
of
confused
noises
in
the
air
;
incoherent
*NL*
sounds
of
lamentation
and
regret
;
wailings
inexpressibly
sorrowful
and
*NL*
self-accusatory
.
The
spectre
,
after
listening
for
a
moment
,
joined
in
*NL*
the
mournful
dirge
;
and
floated
out
upon
the
bleak
,
dark
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
followed
to
the
window
:
desperate
in
his
curiosity
.
He
looked
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
was
filled
with
phantoms
,
wandering
hither
and
thither
in
*NL*
restless
haste
,
and
moaning
as
they
went
.
Every
one
of
them
wore
chains
*NL*
like
Marley
's
Ghost
;
some
few
-LRB-
they
might
be
guilty
governments
-RRB-
were
*NL*
linked
together
;
none
were
free
.
Many
had
been
personally
known
to
*NL*
Scrooge
in
their
lives
.
He
had
been
quite
familiar
with
one
old
ghost
in
*NL*
a
white
waistcoat
,
with
a
monstrous
iron
safe
attached
to
its
ankle
,
who
*NL*
cried
piteously
at
being
unable
to
assist
a
wretched
woman
with
an
*NL*
infant
,
whom
it
saw
below
upon
a
doorstep
.
The
misery
with
them
all
was
,
*NL*
clearly
,
that
they
sought
to
interfere
,
for
good
,
in
human
matters
,
and
*NL*
had
lost
the
power
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
these
creatures
faded
into
mist
,
or
mist
enshrouded
them
,
he
*NL*
could
not
tell
.
But
they
and
their
spirit
voices
faded
together
;
and
the
*NL*
night
became
as
it
had
been
when
he
walked
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
closed
the
window
,
and
examined
the
door
by
which
the
Ghost
had
*NL*
entered
.
It
was
double
locked
,
as
he
had
locked
it
with
his
own
hands
,
*NL*
and
the
bolts
were
undisturbed
.
He
tried
to
say
``
Humbug
!
''
but
stopped
at
*NL*
the
first
syllable
.
And
being
,
from
the
emotion
he
had
undergone
,
or
the
*NL*
fatigues
of
the
day
,
or
his
glimpse
of
the
Invisible
World
,
or
the
dull
*NL*
conversation
of
the
Ghost
,
or
the
lateness
of
the
hour
,
much
in
need
of
*NL*
repose
,
went
straight
to
bed
without
undressing
,
and
fell
asleep
upon
*NL*
the
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

STAVE

*NL*

FIRST
OF
THE
THREE
SPIRITS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Scrooge
awoke
it
was
so
dark
,
that
,
looking
out
of
bed
,
he
could
*NL*
scarcely
distinguish
the
transparent
window
from
the
opaque
walls
of
his
*NL*
chamber
.
He
was
endeavouring
to
pierce
the
darkness
with
his
ferret
*NL*
eyes
,
when
the
chimes
of
a
neighbouring
church
struck
the
four
quarters
.
*NL*
So
he
listened
for
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
great
astonishment
,
the
heavy
bell
went
on
from
six
to
seven
,
and
*NL*
from
seven
to
eight
,
and
regularly
up
to
twelve
;
then
stopped
.
Twelve
!
*NL*
It
was
past
two
when
he
went
to
bed
.
The
clock
was
wrong
.
An
icicle
must
*NL*
have
got
into
the
works
.
Twelve
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
the
spring
of
his
repeater
,
to
correct
this
most
preposterous
*NL*
clock
.
Its
rapid
little
pulse
beat
twelve
,
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
is
n't
possible
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
that
I
can
have
slept
through
a
*NL*
whole
day
and
far
into
another
night
.
It
is
n't
possible
that
anything
*NL*
has
happened
to
the
sun
,
and
this
is
twelve
at
noon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
being
an
alarming
one
,
he
scrambled
out
of
bed
,
and
groped
his
*NL*
way
to
the
window
.
He
was
obliged
to
rub
the
frost
off
with
the
sleeve
*NL*
of
his
dressing-gown
before
he
could
see
anything
;
and
could
see
very
*NL*
little
then
.
All
he
could
make
out
was
,
that
it
was
still
very
foggy
and
*NL*
extremely
cold
,
and
that
there
was
no
noise
of
people
running
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
and
making
a
great
stir
,
as
there
unquestionably
would
have
been
if
*NL*
night
had
beaten
off
bright
day
,
and
taken
possession
of
the
world
.
*NL*
This
was
a
great
relief
,
because
``
Three
days
after
sight
of
this
First
*NL*
of
Exchange
pay
to
Mr.
Ebenezer
Scrooge
or
his
order
,
''
and
so
forth
,
*NL*
would
have
become
a
mere
United
States
security
if
there
were
no
days
to
*NL*
count
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
went
to
bed
again
,
and
thought
,
and
thought
,
and
thought
it
over
*NL*
and
over
,
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
The
more
he
thought
,
the
more
*NL*
perplexed
he
was
;
and
,
the
more
he
endeavoured
not
to
think
,
the
more
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marley
's
Ghost
bothered
him
exceedingly
.
Every
time
he
resolved
within
*NL*
himself
,
after
mature
inquiry
,
that
it
was
all
a
dream
,
his
mind
flew
*NL*
back
again
,
like
a
strong
spring
released
,
to
its
first
position
,
and
*NL*
presented
the
same
problem
to
be
worked
all
through
,
``
Was
it
a
dream
or
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
lay
in
this
state
until
the
chime
had
gone
three
quarters
more
,
*NL*
when
he
remembered
,
on
a
sudden
,
that
the
Ghost
had
warned
him
of
a
*NL*
visitation
when
the
bell
tolled
one
.
He
resolved
to
lie
awake
until
the
*NL*
hour
was
passed
;
and
,
considering
that
he
could
no
more
go
to
sleep
than
*NL*
go
to
Heaven
,
this
was
,
perhaps
,
the
wisest
resolution
in
his
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quarter
was
so
long
,
that
he
was
more
than
once
convinced
he
must
*NL*
have
sunk
into
a
doze
unconsciously
,
and
missed
the
clock
.
At
length
it
*NL*
broke
upon
his
listening
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ding
,
dong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarter
past
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
counting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ding
,
dong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
past
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ding
,
dong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarter
to
it
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ding
,
dong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hour
itself
,
''
said
Scrooge
triumphantly
,
``
and
nothing
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
before
the
hour
bell
sounded
,
which
it
now
did
with
a
deep
,
*NL*
dull
,
hollow
,
melancholy
ONE
.
Light
flashed
up
in
the
room
upon
the
*NL*
instant
,
and
the
curtains
of
his
bed
were
drawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtains
of
his
bed
were
drawn
aside
,
I
tell
you
,
by
a
hand
.
Not
the
*NL*
curtains
at
his
feet
,
nor
the
curtains
at
his
back
,
but
those
to
which
*NL*
his
face
was
addressed
.
The
curtains
of
his
bed
were
drawn
aside
;
and
*NL*
Scrooge
,
starting
up
into
a
half-recumbent
attitude
,
found
himself
face
*NL*
to
face
with
the
unearthly
visitor
who
drew
them
:
as
close
to
it
as
I
am
*NL*
now
to
you
,
and
I
am
standing
in
the
spirit
at
your
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
strange
figure
--
like
a
child
:
yet
not
so
like
a
child
as
like
*NL*
an
old
man
,
viewed
through
some
supernatural
medium
,
which
gave
him
the
*NL*
appearance
of
having
receded
from
the
view
,
and
being
diminished
to
a
*NL*
child
's
proportions
.
Its
hair
,
which
hung
about
its
neck
and
down
its
*NL*
back
,
was
white
,
as
if
with
age
;
and
yet
the
face
had
not
a
wrinkle
in
*NL*
it
,
and
the
tenderest
bloom
was
on
the
skin
.
The
arms
were
very
long
and
*NL*
muscular
;
the
hands
the
same
,
as
if
its
hold
were
of
uncommon
strength
.
*NL*
Its
legs
and
feet
,
most
delicately
formed
,
were
,
like
those
upper
*NL*
members
,
bare
.
It
wore
a
tunic
of
the
purest
white
;
and
round
its
waist
*NL*
was
bound
a
lustrous
belt
,
the
sheen
of
which
was
beautiful
.
It
held
a
*NL*
branch
of
fresh
green
holly
in
its
hand
:
and
,
in
singular
contradiction
*NL*
of
that
wintry
emblem
,
had
its
dress
trimmed
with
summer
flowers
.
But
*NL*
the
strangest
thing
about
it
was
,
that
from
the
crown
of
its
head
there
*NL*
sprung
a
bright
clear
jet
of
light
,
by
which
all
this
was
visible
;
and
*NL*
which
was
doubtless
the
occasion
of
its
using
,
in
its
duller
moments
,
a
*NL*
great
extinguisher
for
a
cap
,
which
it
now
held
under
its
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
this
,
though
,
when
Scrooge
looked
at
it
with
increasing
steadiness
,
*NL*
was
_
not
_
its
strangest
quality
.
For
,
as
its
belt
sparkled
and
*NL*
glittered
,
now
in
one
part
and
now
in
another
,
and
what
was
light
one
*NL*
instant
at
another
time
was
dark
,
so
the
figure
itself
fluctuated
in
its
*NL*
distinctness
:
being
now
a
thing
with
one
arm
,
now
with
one
leg
,
now
with
*NL*
twenty
legs
,
now
a
pair
of
legs
without
a
head
,
now
a
head
without
a
*NL*
body
:
of
which
dissolving
parts
no
outline
would
be
visible
in
the
dense
*NL*
gloom
wherein
they
melted
away
.
And
,
in
the
very
wonder
of
this
,
it
*NL*
would
be
itself
again
;
distinct
and
clear
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
Spirit
,
sir
,
whose
coming
was
foretold
to
me
?
''
asked
*NL*
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
was
soft
and
gentle
.
Singularly
low
,
as
if
,
instead
of
being
*NL*
so
close
beside
him
,
it
were
at
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
and
what
are
you
?
''
Scrooge
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
Ghost
of
Christmas
Past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
Past
?
''
inquired
Scrooge
;
observant
of
its
dwarfish
stature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Your
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Scrooge
could
not
have
told
anybody
why
,
if
anybody
could
have
*NL*
asked
him
;
but
he
had
a
special
desire
to
see
the
Spirit
in
his
cap
;
and
*NL*
begged
him
to
be
covered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
exclaimed
the
Ghost
,
``
would
you
so
soon
put
out
,
with
worldly
*NL*
hands
,
the
light
I
give
?
Is
it
not
enough
that
you
are
one
of
those
*NL*
whose
passions
made
this
cap
,
and
force
me
through
whole
trains
of
years
*NL*
to
wear
it
low
upon
my
brow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
reverently
disclaimed
all
intention
to
offend
or
any
knowledge
*NL*
of
having
wilfully
``
bonneted
''
the
Spirit
at
any
period
of
his
life
.
He
*NL*
then
made
bold
to
inquire
what
business
brought
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
welfare
!
''
said
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
expressed
himself
much
obliged
,
but
could
not
help
thinking
that
*NL*
a
night
of
unbroken
rest
would
have
been
more
conducive
to
that
end
.
The
*NL*
Spirit
must
have
heard
him
thinking
,
for
it
said
immediately
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
reclamation
,
then
.
Take
heed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
put
out
its
strong
hand
as
it
spoke
,
and
clasped
him
gently
by
the
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rise
!
and
walk
with
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
in
vain
for
Scrooge
to
plead
that
the
weather
and
the
*NL*
hour
were
not
adapted
to
pedestrian
purposes
;
that
bed
was
warm
,
and
*NL*
the
thermometer
a
long
way
below
freezing
;
that
he
was
clad
but
lightly
*NL*
in
his
slippers
,
dressing-gown
,
and
nightcap
;
and
that
he
had
a
cold
*NL*
upon
him
at
that
time
.
The
grasp
,
though
gentle
as
a
woman
's
hand
,
was
*NL*
not
to
be
resisted
.
He
rose
:
but
,
finding
that
the
Spirit
made
towards
*NL*
the
window
,
clasped
its
robe
in
supplication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
mortal
,
''
Scrooge
remonstrated
,
``
and
liable
to
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bear
but
a
touch
of
my
hand
_
there
_
,
''
said
the
Spirit
,
laying
it
upon
*NL*
his
heart
,
``
and
you
shall
be
upheld
in
more
than
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
words
were
spoken
,
they
passed
through
the
wall
,
and
stood
upon
*NL*
an
open
country
road
,
with
fields
on
either
hand
.
The
city
had
entirely
*NL*
vanished
.
Not
a
vestige
of
it
was
to
be
seen
.
The
darkness
and
the
mist
*NL*
had
vanished
with
it
,
for
it
was
a
clear
,
cold
,
winter
day
,
with
the
*NL*
snow
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heaven
!
''
said
Scrooge
,
clasping
his
hands
together
as
he
looked
*NL*
about
him
.
``
I
was
bred
in
this
place
.
I
was
a
boy
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
gazed
upon
him
mildly
.
Its
gentle
touch
,
though
it
had
been
*NL*
light
and
instantaneous
,
appeared
still
present
to
the
old
man
's
sense
*NL*
of
feeling
.
He
was
conscious
of
a
thousand
odours
floating
in
the
air
,
*NL*
each
one
connected
with
a
thousand
thoughts
,
and
hopes
,
and
joys
,
and
*NL*
cares
long
,
long
forgotten
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
lip
is
trembling
,
''
said
the
Ghost
.
``
And
what
is
that
upon
your
*NL*
cheek
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
muttered
,
with
an
unusual
catching
in
his
voice
,
that
it
was
a
*NL*
pimple
;
and
begged
the
Ghost
to
lead
him
where
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
recollect
the
way
?
''
inquired
the
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
it
!
''
cried
Scrooge
with
fervour
;
``
I
could
walk
it
blindfold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
to
have
forgotten
it
for
so
many
years
!
''
observed
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
on
.

*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
the
road
,
Scrooge
recognising
every
gate
,
and
post
,
*NL*
and
tree
,
until
a
little
market-town
appeared
in
the
distance
,
with
its
*NL*
bridge
,
its
church
,
and
winding
river
.
Some
shaggy
ponies
now
were
seen
*NL*
trotting
towards
them
with
boys
upon
their
backs
,
who
called
to
other
*NL*
boys
in
country
gigs
and
carts
,
driven
by
farmers
.
All
these
boys
were
*NL*
in
great
spirits
,
and
shouted
to
each
other
,
until
the
broad
fields
were
*NL*
so
full
of
merry
music
,
that
the
crisp
air
laughed
to
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
but
shadows
of
the
things
that
have
been
,
''
said
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
``
They
have
no
consciousness
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
jocund
travellers
came
on
;
and
as
they
came
,
Scrooge
knew
and
named
*NL*
them
every
one
.
Why
was
he
rejoiced
beyond
all
bounds
to
see
them
?
Why
*NL*
did
his
cold
eye
glisten
,
and
his
heart
leap
up
as
they
went
past
?
Why
*NL*
was
he
filled
with
gladness
when
he
heard
them
give
each
other
Merry
*NL*
Christmas
,
as
they
parted
at
cross-roads
and
by-ways
for
their
several
*NL*
homes
?
What
was
merry
Christmas
to
Scrooge
?
Out
upon
merry
Christmas
!
*NL*
What
good
had
it
ever
done
to
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
school
is
not
quite
deserted
,
''
said
the
Ghost
.
``
A
solitary
child
,
*NL*
neglected
by
his
friends
,
is
left
there
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
said
he
knew
it
.
And
he
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
high-road
by
a
well-remembered
lane
,
and
soon
approached
a
*NL*
mansion
of
dull
red
brick
,
with
a
little
weather-cock
surmounted
cupola
*NL*
on
the
roof
and
a
bell
hanging
in
it
.
It
was
a
large
house
,
but
one
of
*NL*
broken
fortunes
:
for
the
spacious
offices
were
little
used
,
their
walls
*NL*
were
damp
and
mossy
,
their
windows
broken
,
and
their
gates
decayed
.
*NL*
Fowls
clucked
and
strutted
in
the
stables
;
and
the
coach-houses
and
*NL*
sheds
were
overrun
with
grass
.
Nor
was
it
more
retentive
of
its
ancient
*NL*
state
within
;
for
,
entering
the
dreary
hall
,
and
glancing
through
the
*NL*
open
doors
of
many
rooms
,
they
found
them
poorly
furnished
,
cold
,
and
*NL*
vast
.
There
was
an
earthly
savour
in
the
air
,
a
chilly
bareness
in
the
*NL*
place
,
which
associated
itself
somehow
with
too
much
getting
up
by
*NL*
candle-light
,
and
not
too
much
to
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
,
the
Ghost
and
Scrooge
,
across
the
hall
,
to
a
door
at
the
*NL*
back
of
the
house
.
It
opened
before
them
,
and
disclosed
a
long
,
bare
,
*NL*
melancholy
room
,
made
barer
still
by
lines
of
plain
deal
forms
and
*NL*
desks
.
At
one
of
these
a
lonely
boy
was
reading
near
a
feeble
fire
;
and
*NL*
Scrooge
sat
down
upon
a
form
,
and
wept
to
see
his
poor
forgotten
self
as
*NL*
he
had
used
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
latent
echo
in
the
house
,
not
a
squeak
and
scuffle
from
the
mice
*NL*
behind
the
panelling
,
not
a
drip
from
the
half-thawed
water-spout
in
the
*NL*
dull
yard
behind
,
not
a
sigh
among
the
leafless
boughs
of
one
despondent
*NL*
poplar
,
not
the
idle
swinging
of
an
empty
storehouse
door
,
no
,
not
a
*NL*
clicking
in
the
fire
,
but
fell
upon
the
heart
of
Scrooge
with
softening
*NL*
influence
,
and
gave
a
freer
passage
to
his
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
touched
him
on
the
arm
,
and
pointed
to
his
younger
self
,
*NL*
intent
upon
his
reading
.
Suddenly
a
man
in
foreign
garments
:
wonderfully
*NL*
real
and
distinct
to
look
at
:
stood
outside
the
window
,
with
an
axe
*NL*
stuck
in
his
belt
,
and
leading
by
the
bridle
an
ass
laden
with
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
Ali
Baba
!
''
Scrooge
exclaimed
in
ecstasy
.
``
It
's
dear
old
*NL*
honest
Ali
Baba
!
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
.
One
Christmas-time
when
yonder
*NL*
solitary
child
was
left
here
all
alone
,
he
_
did
_
come
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
just
like
that
.
Poor
boy
!
And
Valentine
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
and
his
*NL*
wild
brother
,
Orson
;
there
they
go
!
And
what
's
his
name
,
who
was
put
*NL*
down
in
his
drawers
,
asleep
,
at
the
gate
of
Damascus
;
do
n't
you
see
him
?
*NL*
And
the
Sultan
's
Groom
turned
upside
down
by
the
Genii
:
there
he
is
upon
*NL*
his
head
!
Serve
him
right
!
I
'm
glad
of
it
.
What
business
had
_
he
_
to
be
*NL*
married
to
the
Princess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
hear
Scrooge
expending
all
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
on
such
*NL*
subjects
,
in
a
most
extraordinary
voice
between
laughing
and
crying
;
and
*NL*
to
see
his
heightened
and
excited
face
;
would
have
been
a
surprise
to
*NL*
his
business
friends
in
the
City
,
indeed
.

_
``
Why
,
it
's
Ali
Baba
!
''
Scrooge
exclaimed
in
ecstasy
.
*NL*
``
It
's
dear
old
honest
Ali
Baba
.
''
_
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
Parrot
!
''
cried
Scrooge
.
``
Green
body
and
yellow
tail
,
with
*NL*
a
thing
like
a
lettuce
growing
out
of
the
top
of
his
head
;
there
he
is
!
*NL*
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
he
called
him
,
when
he
came
home
again
after
sailing
*NL*
round
the
island
.
`
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
,
where
have
you
been
,
Robin
*NL*
Crusoe
?
'
The
man
thought
he
was
dreaming
,
but
he
was
n't
.
It
was
the
*NL*
Parrot
,
you
know
.
There
goes
Friday
,
running
for
his
life
to
the
little
*NL*
creek
!
Halloa
!
Hoop
!
Halloo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
with
a
rapidity
of
transition
very
foreign
to
his
usual
character
,
*NL*
he
said
,
in
pity
for
his
former
self
,
``
Poor
boy
!
''
and
cried
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
Scrooge
muttered
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
looking
*NL*
about
him
,
after
drying
his
eyes
with
his
cuff
:
``
but
it
's
too
late
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
the
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
Nothing
.
There
was
a
boy
singing
a
Christmas
*NL*
Carol
at
my
door
last
night
.
I
should
like
to
have
given
him
something
:
*NL*
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
smiled
thoughtfully
,
and
waved
its
hand
:
saying
,
as
it
did
so
,
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
another
Christmas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
's
former
self
grew
larger
at
the
words
,
and
the
room
became
a
*NL*
little
darker
and
more
dirty
.
The
panels
shrunk
,
the
windows
cracked
;
*NL*
fragments
of
plaster
fell
out
of
the
ceiling
,
and
the
naked
laths
were
*NL*
shown
instead
;
but
how
all
this
was
brought
about
Scrooge
knew
no
more
*NL*
than
you
do
.
He
only
knew
that
it
was
quite
correct
:
that
everything
had
*NL*
happened
so
;
that
there
he
was
,
alone
again
,
when
all
the
other
boys
had
*NL*
gone
home
for
the
jolly
holidays
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
reading
now
,
but
walking
up
and
down
despairingly
.
Scrooge
*NL*
looked
at
the
Ghost
,
and
,
with
a
mournful
shaking
of
his
head
,
glanced
*NL*
anxiously
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
opened
;
and
a
little
girl
,
much
younger
than
the
boy
,
came
darting
*NL*
in
,
and
,
putting
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
often
kissing
him
,
*NL*
addressed
him
as
her
``
dear
,
dear
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
bring
you
home
,
dear
brother
!
''
said
the
child
,
clapping
*NL*
her
tiny
hands
,
and
bending
down
to
laugh
.
``
To
bring
you
home
,
home
,
*NL*
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
,
little
Fan
?
''
returned
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
said
the
child
,
brimful
of
glee
.
``
Home
for
good
and
all
.
Home
for
*NL*
ever
and
ever
.
Father
is
so
much
kinder
than
he
used
to
be
,
that
home
's
*NL*
like
Heaven
!
He
spoke
so
gently
to
me
one
dear
night
when
I
was
going
to
*NL*
bed
,
that
I
was
not
afraid
to
ask
him
once
more
if
you
might
come
home
;
*NL*
and
he
said
Yes
,
you
should
;
and
sent
me
in
a
coach
to
bring
you
.
And
*NL*
you
're
to
be
a
man
!
''
said
the
child
,
opening
her
eyes
;
``
and
are
never
to
*NL*
come
back
here
;
but
first
we
're
to
be
together
all
the
Christmas
long
,
*NL*
and
have
the
merriest
time
in
all
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
a
woman
,
little
Fan
!
''
exclaimed
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
,
and
tried
to
touch
his
head
;
but
,
*NL*
being
too
little
,
laughed
again
,
and
stood
on
tiptoe
to
embrace
him
.
*NL*
Then
she
began
to
drag
him
,
in
her
childish
eagerness
,
towards
the
door
;
*NL*
and
he
,
nothing
loath
to
go
,
accompanied
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
voice
in
the
hall
cried
,
``
Bring
down
Master
Scrooge
's
box
,
*NL*
there
!
''
and
in
the
hall
appeared
the
schoolmaster
himself
,
who
glared
on
*NL*
Master
Scrooge
with
a
ferocious
condescension
,
and
threw
him
into
a
*NL*
dreadful
state
of
mind
by
shaking
hands
with
him
.
He
then
conveyed
him
*NL*
and
his
sister
into
the
veriest
old
well
of
a
shivering
best
parlour
*NL*
that
ever
was
seen
,
where
the
maps
upon
the
wall
,
and
the
celestial
and
*NL*
terrestrial
globes
in
the
windows
,
were
waxy
with
cold
.
Here
he
produced
*NL*
a
decanter
of
curiously
light
wine
,
and
a
block
of
curiously
heavy
cake
,
*NL*
and
administered
instalments
of
those
dainties
to
the
young
people
:
at
*NL*
the
same
time
sending
out
a
meagre
servant
to
offer
a
glass
of
*NL*
``
something
''
to
the
postboy
who
answered
that
he
thanked
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
but
,
if
it
was
the
same
tap
as
he
had
tasted
before
,
he
had
rather
not
.
*NL*
Master
Scrooge
's
trunk
being
by
this
time
tied
on
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
chaise
,
the
children
bade
the
schoolmaster
good-bye
right
willingly
;
*NL*
and
,
getting
into
it
,
drove
gaily
down
the
garden
sweep
;
the
quick
*NL*
wheels
dashing
the
hoar
frost
and
snow
from
off
the
dark
leaves
of
the
*NL*
evergreens
like
spray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
a
delicate
creature
,
whom
a
breath
might
have
withered
,
''
said
*NL*
the
Ghost
.
``
But
she
had
a
large
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
had
,
''
cried
Scrooge
.
``
You
're
right
.
I
will
not
gainsay
it
,
*NL*
Spirit
.
God
forbid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
died
a
woman
,
''
said
the
Ghost
,
``
and
had
,
as
I
think
,
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
child
,
''
Scrooge
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
the
Ghost
.
``
Your
nephew
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
seemed
uneasy
in
his
mind
;
and
answered
briefly
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
they
had
but
that
moment
left
the
school
behind
them
,
they
were
*NL*
now
in
the
busy
thoroughfares
of
a
city
,
where
shadowy
passengers
passed
*NL*
and
repassed
;
where
shadowy
carts
and
coaches
battled
for
the
way
,
and
*NL*
all
the
strife
and
tumult
of
a
real
city
were
.
It
was
made
plain
enough
,
*NL*
by
the
dressing
of
the
shops
,
that
here
,
too
,
it
was
Christmas-time
*NL*
again
;
but
it
was
evening
,
and
the
streets
were
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
stopped
at
a
certain
warehouse
door
,
and
asked
Scrooge
if
he
*NL*
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
it
!
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
Was
I
apprenticed
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
in
.
At
sight
of
an
old
gentleman
in
a
Welsh
wig
,
sitting
*NL*
behind
such
a
high
desk
,
that
if
he
had
been
two
inches
taller
,
he
must
*NL*
have
knocked
his
head
against
the
ceiling
,
Scrooge
cried
in
great
*NL*
excitement
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
old
Fezziwig
!
Bless
his
heart
,
it
's
Fezziwig
alive
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Fezziwig
laid
down
his
pen
,
and
looked
up
at
the
clock
,
which
*NL*
pointed
to
the
hour
of
seven
.
He
rubbed
his
hands
;
adjusted
his
*NL*
capacious
waistcoat
;
laughed
all
over
himself
,
from
his
shoes
to
his
*NL*
organ
of
benevolence
;
and
called
out
,
in
a
comfortable
,
oily
,
rich
,
fat
,
*NL*
jovial
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yo
ho
,
there
!
Ebenezer
!
Dick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
's
former
self
,
now
grown
a
young
man
,
came
briskly
in
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
his
fellow
-
`
prentice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick
Wilkins
,
to
be
sure
!
''
said
Scrooge
to
the
Ghost
.
``
Bless
me
,
yes
.
*NL*
There
he
is
.
He
was
very
much
attached
to
me
,
was
Dick

Poor
Dick
!
Dear
,
*NL*
dear
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yo

said
Fezziwig
.
``
No
more
work
to-night

Christmas-eve

Christmas

Ebenezer

Let
's
have
the
shutters
up

''
cried
old
*NL*
Fezziwig
with
a
sharp
clap
of
his
hands
,
``
before
a
man
can
say
Jack
*NL*
Robinson
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
would
n't
believe
how
those
two
fellows
went
at
it
!
They
charged
into
*NL*
the
street
with
the
shutters
--
one
,
two
,
three
--
had
'em
up
in
their
*NL*
places
--
four
,
five
,
six
--
barred
'em
and
pinned
'em
--
seven
,
eight
,
*NL*
nine
--
and
came
back
before
you
could
have
got
to
twelve
,
panting
like
*NL*
race-horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hilli-ho
!
''
cried
old
Fezziwig
,
skipping
down
from
the
high
desk
with
*NL*
wonderful
agility
.
``
Clear
away
,
my
lads
,
and
let
's
have
lots
of
room
*NL*
here
!
Hilli-ho
,
Dick
!
Chirrup
,
Ebenezer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clear
away
!
There
was
nothing
they
would
n't
have
cleared
away
,
or
*NL*
could
n't
have
cleared
away
,
with
old
Fezziwig
looking
on
.
It
was
done
in
*NL*
a
minute
.
Every
movable
was
packed
off
,
as
if
it
were
dismissed
from
*NL*
public
life
for
evermore
;
the
floor
was
swept
and
watered
,
the
lamps
*NL*
were
trimmed
,
fuel
was
heaped
upon
the
fire
;
and
the
warehouse
was
as
*NL*
snug
,
and
warm
,
and
dry
,
and
bright
a
ball-room
as
you
would
desire
to
*NL*
see
upon
a
winter
's
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
came
a
fiddler
with
a
music-book
,
and
went
up
to
the
lofty
desk
,
and
*NL*
made
an
orchestra
of
it
,
and
tuned
like
fifty
stomachaches
.
In
came
Mrs.
*NL*
Fezziwig
,
one
vast
substantial
smile
.
In
came
the
three
Miss
Fezziwigs
,
*NL*
beaming
and
lovable
.
In
came
the
six
young
followers
whose
hearts
they
*NL*
broke
.
In
came
all
the
young
men
and
women
employed
in
the
business
.
In
*NL*
came
the
housemaid
,
with
her
cousin
the
baker
.
In
came
the
cook
,
with
*NL*
her
brother
's
particular
friend
the
milkman
.
In
came
the
boy
from
over
*NL*
the
way
,
who
was
suspected
of
not
having
board
enough
from
his
master
;
*NL*
trying
to
hide
himself
behind
the
girl
from
next
door
but
one
,
who
was
*NL*
proved
to
have
had
her
ears
pulled
by
her
mistress
.
In
they
all
came
,
*NL*
one
after
another
;
some
shyly
,
some
boldly
,
some
gracefully
,
some
*NL*
awkwardly
,
some
pushing
,
some
pulling
;
in
they
all
came
,
any
how
and
*NL*
every
how
.
Away
they
all
went
,
twenty
couple
at
once
;
hands
half
round
*NL*
and
back
again
the
other
way
;
down
the
middle
and
up
again
;
round
and
*NL*
round
in
various
stages
of
affectionate
grouping
;
old
top
couple
always
*NL*
turning
up
in
the
wrong
place
;
new
top
couple
starting
off
again
as
soon
*NL*
as
they
got
there
;
all
top
couples
at
last
,
and
not
a
bottom
one
to
help
*NL*
them
!
When
this
result
was
brought
about
,
old
Fezziwig
,
clapping
his
*NL*
hands
to
stop
the
dance
,
cried
out
,
``
Well
done
!
''
and
the
fiddler
plunged
*NL*
his
hot
face
into
a
pot
of
porter
,
especially
provided
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
But
,
scorning
rest
upon
his
reappearance
,
he
instantly
began
again
,
*NL*
though
there
were
no
dancers
yet
,
as
if
the
other
fiddler
had
been
*NL*
carried
home
,
exhausted
,
on
a
shutter
,
and
he
were
a
bran-new
man
*NL*
resolved
to
beat
him
out
of
sight
,
or
perish
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
more
dances
,
and
there
were
forfeits
,
and
more
dances
,
and
*NL*
there
was
cake
,
and
there
was
negus
,
and
there
was
a
great
piece
of
Cold
*NL*
Roast
,
and
there
was
a
great
piece
of
Cold
Boiled
,
and
there
were
*NL*
mince-pies
,
and
plenty
of
beer
.
But
the
great
effect
of
the
evening
came
*NL*
after
the
Roast
and
Boiled
,
when
the
fiddler
-LRB-
an
artful
dog
,
mind
!
The
*NL*
sort
of
man
who
knew
his
business
better
than
you
or
I
could
have
told
*NL*
it
him
!
-RRB-
struck
up
``
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
.
''
Then
old
Fezziwig
stood
out
*NL*
to
dance
with
Mrs.
Fezziwig
.
Top
couple
,
too
;
with
a
good
stiff
piece
of
*NL*
work
cut
out
for
them
;
three
or
four
and
twenty
pair
of
partners
;
people
*NL*
who
were
not
to
be
trifled
with
;
people
who
_
would
_
dance
,
and
had
no
*NL*
notion
of
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
they
had
been
twice
as
many
--
ah
!
four
times
--
old
Fezziwig
would
*NL*
have
been
a
match
for
them
,
and
so
would
Mrs.
Fezziwig
.
As
to
_
her
_
,
she
*NL*
was
worthy
to
be
his
partner
in
every
sense
of
the
term
.
If
that
's
not
*NL*
high
praise
,
tell
me
higher
,
and
I
'll
use
it
.
A
positive
light
appeared
*NL*
to
issue
from
Fezziwig
's
calves
.
They
shone
in
every
part
of
the
dance
*NL*
like
moons
.
You
could
n't
have
predicted
,
at
any
given
time
,
what
would
*NL*
become
of
them
next
.
And
when
old
Fezziwig
and
Mrs.
Fezziwig
had
gone
*NL*
all
through
the
dance
;
advance
and
retire
,
both
hands
to
your
partner
,
*NL*
bow
and
curtsy
,
cork-screw
,
thread-the-needle
,
and
back
again
to
your
*NL*
place
;
Fezziwig
``
cut
''
--
cut
so
deftly
,
that
he
appeared
to
wink
with
his
*NL*
legs
,
and
came
upon
his
feet
again
without
a
stagger
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
clock
struck
eleven
,
this
domestic
ball
broke
up
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Fezziwig
took
their
stations
,
one
on
either
side
the
door
,
and
,
shaking
*NL*
hands
with
every
person
individually
as
he
or
she
went
out
,
wished
him
*NL*
or
her
a
Merry
Christmas
.
When
everybody
had
retired
but
the
two
*NL*
`
prentices
,
they
did
the
same
to
them
;
and
thus
the
cheerful
voices
died
*NL*
away
,
and
the
lads
were
left
to
their
beds
;
which
were
under
a
counter
*NL*
in
the
back-shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
this
time
Scrooge
had
acted
like
a
man
out
of
his
*NL*
wits
.
His
heart
and
soul
were
in
the
scene
,
and
with
his
former
self
.
He
*NL*
corroborated
everything
,
remembered
everything
,
enjoyed
everything
,
and
*NL*
underwent
the
strangest
agitation
.
It
was
not
until
now
,
when
the
bright
*NL*
faces
of
his
former
self
and
Dick
were
turned
from
them
,
that
he
*NL*
remembered
the
Ghost
,
and
became
conscious
that
it
was
looking
full
upon
*NL*
him
,
while
the
light
upon
its
head
burnt
very
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
small
matter
,
''
said
the
Ghost
,
``
to
make
these
silly
folks
so
full
of
*NL*
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Small
!
''
echoed
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
signed
to
him
to
listen
to
the
two
apprentices
,
who
were
*NL*
pouring
out
their
hearts
in
praise
of
Fezziwig
;
and
,
when
he
had
done
*NL*
so
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
Is
it
not
?
He
has
spent
but
a
few
pounds
of
your
mortal
money
:
*NL*
three
or
four
,
perhaps
.
Is
that
so
much
that
he
deserves
this
praise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
that
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
heated
by
the
remark
,
and
speaking
*NL*
unconsciously
like
his
former
,
not
his
latter
self
.
``
It
is
n't
that
,
*NL*
Spirit
.
He
has
the
power
to
render
us
happy
or
unhappy
;
to
make
our
*NL*
service
light
or
burdensome
;
a
pleasure
or
a
toil
.
Say
that
his
power
*NL*
lies
in
words
and
looks
;
in
things
so
slight
and
insignificant
that
it
*NL*
is
impossible
to
add
and
count
'em
up
:
what
then
?
The
happiness
he
gives
*NL*
is
quite
as
great
as
if
it
cost
a
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
the
Spirit
's
glance
,
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
particular
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
,
I
think
?
''
the
Ghost
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
no
.
I
should
like
to
be
able
to
say
a
word
or
two
*NL*
to
my
clerk
just
now
.
That
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
former
self
turned
down
the
lamps
as
he
gave
utterance
to
the
wish
;
*NL*
and
Scrooge
and
the
Ghost
again
stood
side
by
side
in
the
open
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
time
grows
short
,
''
observed
the
Spirit
.
``
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
addressed
to
Scrooge
,
or
to
any
one
whom
he
could
see
,
but
*NL*
it
produced
an
immediate
effect
.
For
again
Scrooge
saw
himself
.
He
was
*NL*
older
now
;
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
.
His
face
had
not
the
harsh
and
*NL*
rigid
lines
of
later
years
;
but
it
had
begun
to
wear
the
signs
of
care
*NL*
and
avarice
.
There
was
an
eager
,
greedy
,
restless
motion
in
the
eye
,
*NL*
which
showed
the
passion
that
had
taken
root
,
and
where
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
growing
tree
would
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
alone
,
but
sat
by
the
side
of
a
fair
young
girl
in
a
mourning
*NL*
dress
:
in
whose
eyes
there
were
tears
,
which
sparkled
in
the
light
that
*NL*
shone
out
of
the
Ghost
of
Christmas
Past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
matters
little
,
''
she
said
softly
.
``
To
you
,
very
little
.
Another
idol
*NL*
has
displaced
me
;
and
,
if
it
can
cheer
and
comfort
you
in
time
to
come
*NL*
as
I
would
have
tried
to
do
,
I
have
no
just
cause
to
grieve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Idol
has
displaced
you
?
''
he
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
golden
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
even-handed
dealing
of
the
world
!
''
he
said
.
``
There
is
*NL*
nothing
on
which
it
is
so
hard
as
poverty
;
and
there
is
nothing
it
*NL*
professes
to
condemn
with
such
severity
as
the
pursuit
of
wealth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fear
the
world
too
much
,
''
she
answered
gently
.
``
All
your
other
*NL*
hopes
have
merged
into
the
hope
of
being
beyond
the
chance
of
its
sordid
*NL*
reproach
.
I
have
seen
your
nobler
aspirations
fall
off
one
by
one
,
until
*NL*
the
master
passion
,
Gain
,
engrosses
you
.
Have
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
he
retorted
.
``
Even
if
I
have
grown
so
much
wiser
,
what
*NL*
then
?
I
am
not
changed
towards
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
contract
is
an
old
one
.
It
was
made
when
we
were
both
poor
,
and
*NL*
content
to
be
so
,
until
,
in
good
season
,
we
could
improve
our
worldly
*NL*
fortune
by
our
patient
industry
.
You
_
are
_
changed

When
it
was
made
you
*NL*
were
another
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
a
boy
,
''
he
said
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
own
feeling
tells
you
that
you
were
not
what
you
are

she
*NL*
returned
.
``
I
am

That
which
promised
happiness
when
we
were
one
in
heart
*NL*
is
fraught
with
misery
now
that
we
are
two
.
How
often
and
how
keenly
I
*NL*
have
thought
of
this
I
will
not
say
.
It
is
enough
that
I
_
have
_
thought
*NL*
of
it
,
and
can
release
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
ever
sought
release
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
words

No

Never

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what

then
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
changed
nature

in
an
altered
spirit
;
in
another
atmosphere
of
*NL*
life
;
another
Hope
as
its
great
end
.
In
everything
that
made
my
love
of
*NL*
any
worth
or
value
in
your
sight

If
this
had
never
been
between
us

*NL*
said
the
girl
,
looking
mildly
,
but
with
steadiness
,
upon
him
,
``
tell
me
,
*NL*
would
you
seek
me
out
and
try
to
win
me
now
?
Ah
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
yield
to
the
justice
of
this
supposition
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
.
But
he
said
,
with
a
struggle
,
``
You
think
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
gladly
think
otherwise
if
I
could

she
answered
.
``
Heaven
*NL*
knows
!
When
_
I
_
have
learned
a
Truth
like
this

I
know
how
strong

*NL*
irresistible
it
must
be
.
But
if
you
were
free
to-day
,
to-morrow
,
*NL*
yesterday
,
can
even
I
believe
that
you
would
choose
a
dowerless
*NL*
girl

you
who

in
your

confidence
with

weigh
everything

choosing

you
were
false

to
your
*NL*
one
guiding
principle

do
so
,
do
I
not
know
that
your
repentance
and
*NL*
regret
would
surely
follow
?
I
do
;
and
I
release
you

With
a
full
heart
,
*NL*
for
the
love

once
were

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
about
to
speak
;
but
,
with
her
head
turned
from
him
,
she
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
--
the
memory

past

makes
me
hope

have

.
A
very
,
very
brief
time
,
and
you
will
dismiss
the
*NL*
recollection
of
it
gladly
,
as
an
unprofitable
dream
,
from
which
it
*NL*
happened
well
that
you
awoke
.
May
you
be
happy
in
the
life
you
have
*NL*
chosen

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
him
,
and
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
show
me
no
more
!
Conduct
me
home
.
Why
do
you
*NL*
delight
to
torture
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
shadow
more
!
''
exclaimed
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
!
''
cried
Scrooge
.
``
No
more
!
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
it
.
Show
me
no
*NL*
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
relentless
Ghost
pinioned
him
in
both
his
arms
,
and
forced
him
*NL*
to
observe
what
happened
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
another
scene
and
place
;
a
room
,
not
very
large
or
*NL*
handsome
,
but
full
of
comfort
.
Near
to
the
winter
fire
sat
a
beautiful
*NL*
young
girl
,
so
like
that
last
that
Scrooge
believed
it
was
the
same
,
*NL*
until
he
saw
_
her
_
,
now
a
comely
matron
,
sitting
opposite
her
daughter
.
*NL*
The
noise
in
this
room
was
perfectly
tumultuous
,
for
there
were
more
*NL*
children
there
than
Scrooge
in
his
agitated
state
of
mind
could
count
;
*NL*
and
,
unlike
the
celebrated
herd
in
the
poem
,
they
were
not
forty
*NL*
children
conducting
themselves
like
one
,
but
every
child
was
conducting
*NL*
itself
like
forty
.
The
consequences
were
uproarious
beyond
belief
;
but
*NL*
no
one
seemed
to
care
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
mother
and
daughter
laughed
*NL*
heartily
,
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
;
and
the
latter
,
soon
beginning
to
*NL*
mingle
in
the
sports
,
got
pillaged
by
the
young
brigands
most
*NL*
ruthlessly
.
What
would
I
not
have
given
to
be
one
of
them
!
Though
I
*NL*
never
could
have
been
so
rude
,
no
,
no
!
I
would
n't
for
the
wealth
of
all
*NL*
the
world
have
crushed
that
braided
hair
,
and
torn
it
down
;
and
,
for
the
*NL*
precious
little
shoe
,
I
would
n't
have
plucked
it
off
,
God
bless
my
soul
!
*NL*
to
save
my
life
.
As
to
measuring
her
waist
in
sport
,
as
they
did
,
bold
*NL*
young
brood
,
I
could
n't
have
done
it
;
I
should
have
expected
my
arm
to
*NL*
have
grown
round
it
for
a
punishment
,
and
never
come
straight
again
.
And
*NL*
yet
I
should
have
dearly
liked
,
I
own
,
to
have
touched
her
lips
;
to
have
*NL*
questioned
her
,
that
she
might
have
opened
them
;
to
have
looked
upon
the
*NL*
lashes
of
her
downcast
eyes
,
and
never
raised
a
blush
;
to
have
let
loose
*NL*
waves
of
hair
,
an
inch
of
which
would
be
a
keepsake
beyond
price
:
in
*NL*
short
,
I
should
have
liked
,
I
do
confess
,
to
have
had
the
lightest
*NL*
licence
of
a
child
,
and
yet
to
have
been
man
enough
to
know
its
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
a
knocking
at
the
door
was
heard
,
and
such
a
rush
immediately
*NL*
ensued
that
she
,
with
laughing
face
and
plundered
dress
,
was
borne
*NL*
towards
it
in
the
centre
of
a
flushed
and
boisterous
group
,
just
in
time
*NL*
to
greet
the
father
,
who
came
home
attended
by
a
man
laden
with
*NL*
Christmas
toys
and
presents
.
Then
the
shouting
and
the
struggling
,
and
*NL*
the
onslaught
that
was
made
on
the
defenceless
porter
!
The
scaling
him
,
*NL*
with
chairs
for
ladders
,
to
dive
into
his
pockets
,
despoil
him
of
*NL*
brown-paper
parcels
,
hold
on
tight
by
his
cravat
,
hug
him
round
the
*NL*
neck
,
pummel
his
back
,
and
kick
his
legs
in
irrepressible
affection
!
The
*NL*
shouts
of
wonder
and
delight
with
which
the
development
of
every
package
*NL*
was
received
!
The
terrible
announcement
that
the
baby
had
been
taken
in
*NL*
the
act
of
putting
a
doll
's
frying-pan
into
his
mouth
,
and
was
more
than
*NL*
suspected
of
having
swallowed
a
fictitious
turkey
,
glued
on
a
wooden
*NL*
platter
!
The
immense
relief
of
finding
this
a
false
alarm
!
The
joy
,
and
*NL*
gratitude
,
and
ecstasy
!
They
are
all
indescribable
alike
.
It
is
enough
*NL*
that
by
degrees
,
the
children
and
their
emotions
got
out
of
the
parlour
,
*NL*
and
,
by
one
stair
at
a
time
,
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
where
they
went
*NL*
to
bed
,
and
so
subsided
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
Scrooge
looked
on
more
attentively
than
ever
,
when
the
master
of
*NL*
the
house
,
having
his
daughter
leaning
fondly
on
him
,
sat
down
with
her
*NL*
and
her
mother
at
his
own
fireside
;
and
when
he
thought
that
such
*NL*
another
creature
,
quite
as
graceful
and
as
full
of
promise
,
might
have
*NL*
called
him
father
,
and
been
a
spring-time
in
the
haggard
winter
of
his
*NL*
life
,
his
sight
grew
very
dim
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belle
,
''
said
the
husband
,
turning
to
his
wife
with
a
smile
,
``
I
saw
an
*NL*
old
friend
of
yours
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
?
Tut
,
do
n't
I
know
?
''
she
added
in
the
same
breath
,
laughing
*NL*
as
he
laughed
.
``
Mr.
Scrooge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Scrooge
it
was
.
I
passed
his
office
window
;
and
as
it
was
not
shut
*NL*
up
,
and
he
had
a
candle
inside
,
I
could
scarcely
help
seeing
him
.
His
*NL*
partner
lies
upon
the
point
of
death
,
I
hear
;
and
there
he
sat
alone
.
*NL*
Quite
alone
in
the
world
,
I
do
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
''
said
Scrooge
in
a
broken
voice
,
``
remove
me
from
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
these
were
shadows
of
the
things
that
have
been
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Ghost
.
``
That
they
are
what
they
are
,
do
not
blame
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remove
me
!
''
Scrooge
exclaimed
.
``
I
can
not
bear
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
upon
the
Ghost
,
and
seeing
that
it
looked
upon
him
with
a
face
*NL*
in
which
in
some
strange
way
there
were
fragments
of
all
the
faces
it
*NL*
had
shown
him
,
wrestled
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
!
Take
me
back
!
Haunt
me
no
longer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
struggle
--
if
that
can
be
called
a
struggle
in
which
the
Ghost
,
*NL*
with
no
visible
resistance
on
its
own
part
,
was
undisturbed
by
any
*NL*
effort
of
its
adversary
--
Scrooge
observed
that
its
light
was
burning
*NL*
high
and
bright
;
and
dimly
connecting
that
with
its
influence
over
him
,
*NL*
he
seized
the
extinguisher
cap
,
and
by
a
sudden
action
pressed
it
down
*NL*
upon
its
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
dropped
beneath
it
,
so
that
the
extinguisher
covered
its
*NL*
whole
form
;
but
,
though
Scrooge
pressed
it
down
with
all
his
force
,
he
*NL*
could
not
hide
the
light
,
which
streamed
from
under
it
in
an
unbroken
*NL*
flood
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
conscious
of
being
exhausted
,
and
overcome
by
an
irresistible
*NL*
drowsiness
;
and
,
further
,
of
being
in
his
own
bedroom
.
He
gave
the
cap
a
*NL*
parting
squeeze
,
in
which
his
hand
relaxed
;
and
had
barely
time
to
reel
*NL*
to
bed
before
he
sank
into
a
heavy
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
STAVE
THREE
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SECOND
OF
THE
THREE
SPIRITS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Awaking
in
the
middle
of
a
prodigiously
tough
snore
,
and
sitting
up
in
*NL*
bed
to
get
his
thoughts
together
,
Scrooge
had
no
occasion
to
be
told
*NL*
that
the
bell
was
again
upon
the
stroke
of
One
.
He
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
restored
to
consciousness
in
the
right
nick
of
time
,
for
the
especial
*NL*
purpose
of
holding
a
conference
with
the
second
messenger
dispatched
to
*NL*
him
through
Jacob
Marley
's
intervention
.
But
,
finding
that
he
turned
*NL*
uncomfortably
cold
when
he
began
to
wonder
which
of
his
curtains
this
*NL*
new
spectre
would
draw
back
,
he
put
them
every
one
aside
with
his
own
*NL*
hands
,
and
,
lying
down
again
,
established
a
sharp
look-out
all
round
the
*NL*
bed
.
For
he
wished
to
challenge
the
Spirit
on
the
moment
of
its
*NL*
appearance
,
and
did
not
wish
to
be
taken
by
surprise
and
made
nervous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentlemen
of
the
free-and-easy
sort
,
who
plume
themselves
on
being
*NL*
acquainted
with
a
move
or
two
,
and
being
usually
equal
to
the
time
of
*NL*
day
,
express
the
wide
range
of
their
capacity
for
adventure
by
observing
*NL*
that
they
are
good
for
anything
from
pitch-and-toss
to
manslaughter
;
*NL*
between
which
opposite
extremes
,
no
doubt
,
there
lies
a
tolerably
wide
*NL*
and
comprehensive
range
of
subjects
.
Without
venturing
for
Scrooge
quite
*NL*
as
hardily
as
this
,
I
do
n't
mind
calling
on
you
to
believe
that
he
was
*NL*
ready
for
a
good
broad
field
of
strange
appearances
,
and
that
nothing
*NL*
between
a
baby
and
a
rhinoceros
would
have
astonished
him
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
being
prepared
for
almost
anything
,
he
was
not
by
any
means
*NL*
prepared
for
nothing
;
and
consequently
,
when
the
bell
struck
One
,
and
*NL*
no
shape
appeared
,
he
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
trembling
.
Five
*NL*
minutes
,
ten
minutes
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
,
yet
nothing
came
.
*NL*
All
this
time
he
lay
upon
his
bed
,
the
very
core
and
centre
of
a
blaze
*NL*
of
ruddy
light
,
which
streamed
upon
it
when
the
clock
proclaimed
the
*NL*
hour
;
and
which
,
being
only
light
,
was
more
alarming
than
a
dozen
*NL*
ghosts
,
as
he
was
powerless
to
make
out
what
it
meant
,
or
would
be
at
;
*NL*
and
was
sometimes
apprehensive
that
he
might
be
at
that
very
moment
an
*NL*
interesting
case
of
spontaneous
combustion
,
without
having
the
*NL*
consolation
of
knowing
it
.
At
last
,
however
,
he
began
to
think
--
as
you
*NL*
or
I
would
have
thought
at
first
;
for
it
is
always
the
person
not
in
the
*NL*
predicament
who
knows
what
ought
to
have
been
done
in
it
,
and
would
*NL*
unquestionably
have
done
it
too
--
at
last
,
I
say
,
he
began
to
think
that
*NL*
the
source
and
secret
of
this
ghostly
light
might
be
in
the
adjoining
*NL*
room
,
from
whence
,
on
further
tracing
it
,
it
seemed
to
shine
.
This
idea
*NL*
taking
full
possession
of
his
mind
,
he
got
up
softly
,
and
shuffled
in
*NL*
his
slippers
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
Scrooge
's
hand
was
on
the
lock
,
a
strange
voice
called
him
by
*NL*
his
name
,
and
bade
him
enter
.
He
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
own
room
.
There
was
no
doubt
about
that
.
But
it
had
undergone
*NL*
a
surprising
transformation
.
The
walls
and
ceiling
were
so
hung
with
*NL*
living
green
,
that
it
looked
a
perfect
grove
;
from
every
part
of
which
*NL*
bright
gleaming
berries
glistened
.
The
crisp
leaves
of
holly
,
mistletoe
,
*NL*
and
ivy
reflected
back
the
light
,
as
if
so
many
little
mirrors
had
been
*NL*
scattered
there
;
and
such
a
mighty
blaze
went
roaring
up
the
chimney
as
*NL*
that
dull
petrifaction
of
a
hearth
had
never
known
in
Scrooge
's
time
,
or
*NL*
Marley
's
,
or
for
many
and
many
a
winter
season
gone
.
Heaped
up
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
to
form
a
kind
of
throne
,
were
turkeys
,
geese
,
game
,
poultry
,
*NL*
brawn
,
great
joints
of
meat
,
sucking-pigs
,
long
wreaths
of
sausages
,
*NL*
mince-pies
,
plum-puddings
,
barrels
of
oysters
,
red-hot
chestnuts
,
*NL*
cherry-cheeked
apples
,
juicy
oranges
,
luscious
pears
,
immense
*NL*
twelfth-cakes
,
and
seething
bowls
of
punch
,
that
made
the
chamber
dim
*NL*
with
their
delicious
steam
.
In
easy
state
upon
this
couch
there
sat
a
*NL*
jolly
Giant
,
glorious
to
see
;
who
bore
a
glowing
torch
,
in
shape
not
*NL*
unlike
Plenty
's
horn
,
and
held
it
up
,
high
up
,
to
shed
its
light
on
*NL*
Scrooge
as
he
came
peeping
round
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
!
''
exclaimed
the
Ghost
.
``
Come
in
!
and
know
me
better
,
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
entered
timidly
,
and
hung
his
head
before
this
Spirit
.
He
was
*NL*
not
the
dogged
Scrooge
he
had
been
;
and
,
though
the
Spirit
's
eyes
were
*NL*
clear
and
kind
,
he
did
not
like
to
meet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
Ghost
of
Christmas
Present
,
''
said
the
Spirit
.
``
Look
upon
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
reverently
did
so
.
It
was
clothed
in
one
simple
deep
green
robe
,
*NL*
or
mantle
,
bordered
with
white
fur
.
This
garment
hung
so
loosely
on
the
*NL*
figure
,
that
its
capacious
breast
was
bare
,
as
if
disdaining
to
be
*NL*
warded
or
concealed
by
any
artifice
.
Its
feet
,
observable
beneath
the
*NL*
ample
folds
of
the
garment
,
were
also
bare
;
and
on
its
head
it
wore
no
*NL*
other
covering
than
a
holly
wreath
,
set
here
and
there
with
shining
*NL*
icicles
.
Its
dark
brown
curls
were
long
and
free
;
free
as
its
genial
*NL*
face
,
its
sparkling
eye
,
its
open
hand
,
its
cheery
voice
,
its
*NL*
unconstrained
demeanour
,
and
its
joyful
air
.
Girded
round
its
middle
was
*NL*
an
antique
scabbard
;
but
no
sword
was
in
it
,
and
the
ancient
sheath
was
*NL*
eaten
up
with
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
seen
the
like
of
me
before
!
''
exclaimed
the
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
Scrooge
made
answer
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
never
walked
forth
with
the
younger
members
of
my
family
;
meaning
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
am
very
young
-RRB-
my
elder
brothers
born
in
these
later
years
?
''
*NL*
pursued
the
Phantom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
have
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
I
am
afraid
I
have
not
.
Have
you
*NL*
had
many
brothers
,
Spirit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
eighteen
hundred
,
''
said
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
tremendous
family
to
provide
for
,
''
muttered
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
of
Christmas
Present
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
,
''
said
Scrooge
submissively
,
``
conduct
me
where
you
will
.
I
went
*NL*
forth
last
night
on
compulsion
,
and
I
learnt
a
lesson
which
is
working
*NL*
now
.
To-night
,
if
you
have
aught
to
teach
me
,
let
me
profit
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Touch
my
robe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
did
as
he
was
told
,
and
held
it
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Holly
,
mistletoe
,
red
berries
,
ivy
,
turkeys
,
geese
,
game
,
poultry
,
*NL*
brawn
,
meat
,
pigs
,
sausages
,
oysters
,
pies
,
puddings
,
fruit
,
and
punch
,
*NL*
all
vanished
instantly
.
So
did
the
room
,
the
fire
,
the
ruddy
glow
,
the
*NL*
hour
of
night
,
and
they
stood
in
the
city
streets
on
Christmas
morning
,
*NL*
where
-LRB-
for
the
weather
was
severe
-RRB-
the
people
made
a
rough
,
but
brisk
*NL*
and
not
unpleasant
kind
of
music
,
in
scraping
the
snow
from
the
pavement
*NL*
in
front
of
their
dwellings
,
and
from
the
tops
of
their
houses
,
whence
*NL*
it
was
mad
delight
to
the
boys
to
see
it
come
plumping
down
into
the
*NL*
road
below
,
and
splitting
into
artificial
little
snow-storms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house-fronts
looked
black
enough
,
and
the
windows
blacker
,
*NL*
contrasting
with
the
smooth
white
sheet
of
snow
upon
the
roofs
,
and
with
*NL*
the
dirtier
snow
upon
the
ground
;
which
last
deposit
had
been
ploughed
*NL*
up
in
deep
furrows
by
the
heavy
wheels
of
carts
and
waggons
;
furrows
*NL*
that
crossed
and
recrossed
each
other
hundreds
of
times
where
the
great
*NL*
streets
branched
off
;
and
made
intricate
channels
,
hard
to
trace
,
in
the
*NL*
thick
yellow
mud
and
icy
water
.
The
sky
was
gloomy
,
and
the
shortest
*NL*
streets
were
choked
up
with
a
dingy
mist
,
half
thawed
,
half
frozen
,
*NL*
whose
heavier
particles
descended
in
a
shower
of
sooty
atoms
,
as
if
all
*NL*
the
chimneys
in
Great
Britain
had
,
by
one
consent
,
caught
fire
,
and
were
*NL*
blazing
away
to
their
dear
hearts
'
content
.
There
was
nothing
very
*NL*
cheerful
in
the
climate
or
the
town
,
and
yet
was
there
an
air
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
abroad
that
the
clearest
summer
air
and
brightest
summer
*NL*
sun
might
have
endeavoured
to
diffuse
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
the
people
who
were
shovelling
away
on
the
housetops
were
jovial
*NL*
and
full
of
glee
;
calling
out
to
one
another
from
the
parapets
,
and
now
*NL*
and
then
exchanging
a
facetious
snowball
--
better-natured
missile
far
*NL*
than
many
a
wordy
jest
--
laughing
heartily
if
it
went
right
,
and
not
less
*NL*
heartily
if
it
went
wrong
.
The
poulterers
'
shops
were
still
half
open
,
*NL*
and
the
fruiterers
'
were
radiant
in
their
glory
.
There
were
great
,
*NL*
round
,
pot-bellied
baskets
of
chestnuts
,
shaped
like
the
waistcoats
of
*NL*
jolly
old
gentlemen
,
lolling
at
the
doors
,
and
tumbling
out
into
the
*NL*
street
in
their
apoplectic
opulence
.
There
were
ruddy
,
brown-faced
,
*NL*
broad-girthed
Spanish
onions
,
shining
in
the
fatness
of
their
growth
*NL*
like
Spanish
Friars
,
and
winking
from
their
shelves
in
wanton
slyness
at
*NL*
the
girls
as
they
went
by
,
and
glanced
demurely
at
the
hung-up
*NL*
mistletoe
.
There
were
pears
and
apples
clustered
high
in
blooming
*NL*
pyramids
;
there
were
bunches
of
grapes
,
made
,
in
the
shopkeepers
'
*NL*
benevolence
,
to
dangle
from
conspicuous
hooks
that
people
's
mouths
might
*NL*
water
gratis
as
they
passed
;
there
were
piles
of
filberts
,
mossy
and
*NL*
brown
,
recalling
,
in
their
fragrance
,
ancient
walks
among
the
woods
,
and
*NL*
pleasant
shufflings
ankle
deep
through
withered
leaves
;
there
were
*NL*
Norfolk
Biffins
,
squab
and
swarthy
,
setting
off
the
yellow
of
the
*NL*
oranges
and
lemons
,
and
,
in
the
great
compactness
of
their
juicy
*NL*
persons
,
urgently
entreating
and
beseeching
to
be
carried
home
in
paper
*NL*
bags
,
and
eaten
after
dinner
.
The
very
gold
and
silver
fish
,
set
forth
*NL*
among
these
choice
fruits
in
a
bowl
,
though
members
of
a
dull
and
*NL*
stagnant-blooded
race
,
appeared
to
know
that
there
was
something
going
*NL*
on
;
and
,
to
a
fish
,
went
gasping
round
and
round
their
little
world
in
*NL*
slow
and
passionless
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grocers
'
!
oh
,
the
Grocers
'
!
nearly
closed
,
with
perhaps
two
shutters
*NL*
down
,
or
one
;
but
through
those
gaps
such
glimpses
!
It
was
not
alone
*NL*
that
the
scales
descending
on
the
counter
made
a
merry
sound
,
or
that
*NL*
the
twine
and
roller
parted
company
so
briskly
,
or
that
the
canisters
*NL*
were
rattled
up
and
down
like
juggling
tricks
,
or
even
that
the
blended
*NL*
scents
of
tea
and
coffee
were
so
grateful
to
the
nose
,
or
even
that
the
*NL*
raisins
were
so
plentiful
and
rare
,
the
almonds
so
extremely
white
,
the
*NL*
sticks
of
cinnamon
so
long
and
straight
,
the
other
spices
so
delicious
,
*NL*
the
candied
fruits
so
caked
and
spotted
with
molten
sugar
as
to
make
the
*NL*
coldest
lookers-on
feel
faint
,
and
subsequently
bilious
.
Nor
was
it
that
*NL*
the
figs
were
moist
and
pulpy
,
or
that
the
French
plums
blushed
in
*NL*
modest
tartness
from
their
highly-decorated
boxes
,
or
that
everything
*NL*
was
good
to
eat
and
in
its
Christmas
dress
;
but
the
customers
were
all
*NL*
so
hurried
and
so
eager
in
the
hopeful
promise
of
the
day
,
that
they
*NL*
tumbled
up
against
each
other
at
the
door
,
crashing
their
wicker
baskets
*NL*
wildly
,
and
left
their
purchases
upon
the
counter
,
and
came
running
back
*NL*
to
fetch
them
,
and
committed
hundreds
of
the
like
mistakes
,
in
the
best
*NL*
humour
possible
;
while
the
Grocer
and
his
people
were
so
frank
and
*NL*
fresh
,
that
the
polished
hearts
with
which
they
fastened
their
aprons
*NL*
behind
might
have
been
their
own
,
worn
outside
for
general
inspection
,
*NL*
and
for
Christmas
daws
to
peck
at
if
they
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
soon
the
steeples
called
good
people
all
to
church
and
chapel
,
and
*NL*
away
they
came
,
flocking
through
the
streets
in
their
best
clothes
,
and
*NL*
with
their
gayest
faces
.
And
at
the
same
time
there
emerged
,
from
scores
*NL*
of
by-streets
,
lanes
,
and
nameless
turnings
,
innumerable
people
,
*NL*
carrying
their
dinners
to
the
bakers
'
shops
.
The
sight
of
these
poor
*NL*
revellers
appeared
to
interest
the
Spirit
very
much
,
for
he
stood
with
*NL*
Scrooge
beside
him
in
a
baker
's
doorway
,
and
,
taking
off
the
covers
as
*NL*
their
bearers
passed
,
sprinkled
incense
on
their
dinners
from
his
torch
.
*NL*
And
it
was
a
very
uncommon
kind
of
torch
,
for
once
or
twice
,
when
there
*NL*
were
angry
words
between
some
dinner-carriers
who
had
jostled
each
*NL*
other
,
he
shed
a
few
drops
of
water
on
them
from
it
,
and
their
*NL*
good-humour
was
restored
directly
.
For
they
said
,
it
was
a
shame
to
*NL*
quarrel
upon
Christmas-day
.
And
so
it
was
!
God
love
it
,
so
it
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
time
the
bells
ceased
,
and
the
bakers
were
shut
up
;
and
yet
there
was
*NL*
a
genial
shadowing
forth
of
all
these
dinners
,
and
the
progress
of
their
*NL*
cooking
,
in
the
thawed
blotch
of
wet
above
each
baker
's
oven
;
where
the
*NL*
pavement
smoked
as
if
its
stones
were
cooking
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
peculiar
flavour
in
what
you
sprinkle
from
your
torch
?
''
*NL*
asked
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
.
My
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
apply
to
any
kind
of
dinner
on
this
day
?
''
asked
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
any
kindly
given
.
To
a
poor
one
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
to
a
poor
one
most
?
''
asked
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
needs
it
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
''
said
Scrooge
after
a
moment
's
thought
.
``
I
wonder
you
,
of
all
*NL*
the
beings
in
the
many
worlds
about
us
,
should
desire
to
cramp
these
*NL*
people
's
opportunities
of
innocent
enjoyment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
cried
the
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
deprive
them
of
their
means
of
dining
every
seventh
day
,
*NL*
often
the
only
day
on
which
they
can
be
said
to
dine
at
all
,
''
said
*NL*
Scrooge
;
``
would
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
cried
the
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seek
to
close
these
places
on
the
Seventh
Day
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
And
*NL*
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
seek
!
''
exclaimed
the
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
if
I
am
wrong
.
It
has
been
done
in
your
name
,
or
at
least
in
*NL*
that
of
your
family
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
upon
this
earth
of
yours
,
''
returned
the
Spirit
,
``
who
lay
*NL*
claim
to
know
us
,
and
who
do
their
deeds
of
passion
,
pride
,
ill-will
,
*NL*
hatred
,
envy
,
bigotry
,
and
selfishness
in
our
name
,
who
are
as
strange
*NL*
to
us
,
and
all
our
kith
and
kin
,
as
if
they
had
never
lived
.
Remember
*NL*
that
,
and
charge
their
doings
on
themselves
,
not
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
promised
that
he
would
;
and
they
went
on
,
invisible
,
as
they
*NL*
had
been
before
,
into
the
suburbs
of
the
town
.
It
was
a
remarkable
*NL*
quality
of
the
Ghost
-LRB-
which
Scrooge
had
observed
at
the
baker
's
-RRB-
,
that
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
his
gigantic
size
,
he
could
accommodate
himself
to
any
*NL*
place
with
ease
;
and
that
he
stood
beneath
a
low
roof
quite
as
*NL*
gracefully
and
like
a
supernatural
creature
as
it
was
possible
he
could
*NL*
have
done
in
any
lofty
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
perhaps
it
was
the
pleasure
the
good
Spirit
had
in
showing
off
this
*NL*
power
of
his
,
or
else
it
was
his
own
kind
,
generous
,
hearty
nature
,
and
*NL*
his
sympathy
with
all
poor
men
,
that
led
him
straight
to
Scrooge
's
*NL*
clerk
's
;
for
there
he
went
,
and
took
Scrooge
with
him
,
holding
to
his
*NL*
robe
;
and
,
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
,
the
Spirit
smiled
,
and
stopped
*NL*
to
bless
Bob
Cratchit
's
dwelling
with
the
sprinklings
of
his
torch
.
*NL*
Think
of
that
!
Bob
had
but
fifteen
``
Bob
''
a
week
himself
;
he
pocketed
on
*NL*
Saturdays
but
fifteen
copies
of
his
Christian
name
;
and
yet
the
Ghost
of
*NL*
Christmas
Present
blessed
his
four-roomed
house
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
up
rose
Mrs.
Cratchit
,
Cratchit
's
wife
,
dressed
out
but
poorly
in
a
*NL*
twice-turned
gown
,
but
brave
in
ribbons
,
which
are
cheap
,
and
make
a
*NL*
goodly
show
for
sixpence
;
and
she
laid
the
cloth
,
assisted
by
Belinda
*NL*
Cratchit
,
second
of
her
daughters
,
also
brave
in
ribbons
;
while
Master
*NL*
Peter
Cratchit
plunged
a
fork
into
the
saucepan
of
potatoes
,
and
,
*NL*
getting
the
corners
of
his
monstrous
shirt
collar
-LRB-
Bob
's
private
*NL*
property
,
conferred
upon
his
son
and
heir
in
honour
of
the
day
-RRB-
into
his
*NL*
mouth
,
rejoiced
to
find
himself
so
gallantly
attired
,
and
yearned
to
*NL*
show
his
linen
in
the
fashionable
Parks
.
And
now
two
smaller
Cratchits
,
*NL*
boy
and
girl
,
came
tearing
in
,
screaming
that
outside
the
baker
's
they
*NL*
had
smelt
the
goose
,
and
known
it
for
their
own
;
and
,
basking
in
*NL*
luxurious
thoughts
of
sage
and
onion
,
these
young
Cratchits
danced
about
*NL*
the
table
,
and
exalted
Master
Peter
Cratchit
to
the
skies
,
while
he
-LRB-
not
*NL*
proud
,
although
his
collars
nearly
choked
him
-RRB-
blew
the
fire
,
until
the
*NL*
slow
potatoes
,
bubbling
up
,
knocked
loudly
at
the
saucepan
lid
to
be
let
*NL*
out
and
peeled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
ever
got
your
precious
father
,
then
?
''
said
Mrs.
Cratchit
.
``
And
*NL*
your
brother
,
Tiny
Tim
?
And
Martha
war
n't
as
late
last
Christmas-day
by
*NL*
half
an
hour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Martha
,
mother
!
''
said
a
girl
,
appearing
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Martha
,
mother
!
''
cried
the
two
young
Cratchits
.
``
Hurrah
!
There
's
*NL*
_
such
_
a
goose
,
Martha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
your
heart
alive
,
my
dear
,
how
late
you
are
!
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Cratchit
,
kissing
her
a
dozen
times
,
and
taking
off
her
shawl
and
bonnet
*NL*
for
her
with
officious
zeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'd
a
deal
of
work
to
finish
up
last
night
,
''
replied
the
girl
,
``
and
*NL*
had
to
clear
away
this
morning
,
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
never
mind
so
long
as
you
are
come
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cratchit
.
``
Sit
ye
*NL*
down
before
the
fire
,
my
dear
,
and
have
a
warm
,
Lord
bless
ye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
There
's
father
coming
,
''
cried
the
two
young
Cratchits
,
who
were
*NL*
everywhere
at
once
.
``
Hide
,
Martha
,
hide
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Martha
hid
herself
,
and
in
came
little
Bob
,
the
father
,
with
at
least
*NL*
three
feet
of
comforter
,
exclusive
of
the
fringe
,
hanging
down
before
*NL*
him
;
and
his
threadbare
clothes
darned
up
and
brushed
to
look
*NL*
seasonable
;
and
Tiny
Tim
upon
his
shoulder
.
Alas
for
Tiny
Tim
,
he
bore
a
*NL*
little
crutch
,
and
had
his
limbs
supported
by
an
iron
frame
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
's
our
Martha
?
''
cried
Bob
Cratchit
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
coming
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cratchit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
coming
!
''
said
Bob
with
a
sudden
declension
in
his
high
spirits
;
for
*NL*
he
had
been
Tim
's
blood
horse
all
the
way
from
church
,
and
had
come
home
*NL*
rampant
.
``
Not
coming
upon
Christmas-day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
did
n't
like
to
see
him
disappointed
,
if
it
were
only
in
joke
;
so
*NL*
she
came
out
prematurely
from
behind
the
closet
door
,
and
ran
into
his
*NL*
arms
,
while
the
two
young
Cratchits
hustled
Tiny
Tim
,
and
bore
him
off
*NL*
into
the
wash-house
,
that
he
might
hear
the
pudding
singing
in
the
*NL*
copper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
little
Tim
behave
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Cratchit
when
she
had
*NL*
rallied
Bob
on
his
credulity
,
and
Bob
had
hugged
his
daughter
to
his
*NL*
heart
's
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
good
as
gold
,
''
said
Bob
,
``
and
better
.
Somehow
,
he
gets
thoughtful
,
*NL*
sitting
by
himself
so
much
,
and
thinks
the
strangest
things
you
ever
*NL*
heard
.
He
told
me
,
coming
home
,
that
he
hoped
the
people
saw
him
in
the
*NL*
church
,
because
he
was
a
cripple
,
and
it
might
be
pleasant
to
them
to
*NL*
remember
upon
Christmas-day
who
made
lame
beggars
walk
and
blind
men
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
's
voice
was
tremulous
when
he
told
them
this
,
and
trembled
more
when
*NL*
he
said
that
Tiny
Tim
was
growing
strong
and
hearty
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
active
little
crutch
was
heard
upon
the
floor
,
and
back
came
Tiny
*NL*
Tim
before
another
word
was
spoken
,
escorted
by
his
brother
and
sister
*NL*
to
his
stool
beside
the
fire
;
and
while
Bob
,
turning
up
his
cuffs
--
as
*NL*
if
,
poor
fellow
,
they
were
capable
of
being
made
more
shabby
--
compounded
*NL*
some
hot
mixture
in
a
jug
with
gin
and
lemons
,
and
stirred
it
round
and
*NL*
round
,
and
put
it
on
the
hob
to
simmer
,
Master
Peter
and
the
two
*NL*
ubiquitous
young
Cratchits
went
to
fetch
the
goose
,
with
which
they
soon
*NL*
returned
in
high
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
bustle
ensued
that
you
might
have
thought
a
goose
the
rarest
of
*NL*
all
birds
;
a
feathered
phenomenon
,
to
which
a
black
swan
was
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
--
and
,
in
truth
,
it
was
something
very
like
it
in
that
house
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Cratchit
made
the
gravy
-LRB-
ready
beforehand
in
a
little
saucepan
-RRB-
hissing
*NL*
hot
;
Master
Peter
mashed
the
potatoes
with
incredible
vigour
;
Miss
*NL*
Belinda
sweetened
up
the
apple
sauce
;
Martha
dusted
the
hot
plates
;
Bob
*NL*
took
Tiny
Tim
beside
him
in
a
tiny
corner
at
the
table
;
the
two
young
*NL*
Cratchits
set
chairs
for
everybody
,
not
forgetting
themselves
,
and
,
*NL*
mounting
guard
upon
their
posts
,
crammed
spoons
into
their
mouths
,
lest
*NL*
they
should
shriek
for
goose
before
their
turn
came
to
be
helped
.
At
*NL*
last
the
dishes
were
set
on
,
and
grace
was
said
.
It
was
succeeded
by
a
*NL*
breathless
pause
,
as
Mrs.
Cratchit
,
looking
slowly
all
along
the
*NL*
carving-knife
,
prepared
to
plunge
it
in
the
breast
;
but
when
she
did
,
*NL*
and
when
the
long-expected
gush
of
stuffing
issued
forth
,
one
murmur
of
*NL*
delight
arose
all
round
the
board
,
and
even
Tiny
Tim
,
excited
by
the
two
*NL*
young
Cratchits
,
beat
on
the
table
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
,
and
*NL*
feebly
cried
Hurrah
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
never
was
such
a
goose
.
Bob
said
he
did
n't
believe
there
ever
was
*NL*
such
a
goose
cooked
.
Its
tenderness
and
flavour
,
size
and
cheapness
,
*NL*
were
the
themes
of
universal
admiration
.
Eked
out
by
apple
sauce
and
*NL*
mashed
potatoes
,
it
was
a
sufficient
dinner
for
the
whole
family
;
*NL*
indeed
,
as
Mrs.
Cratchit
said
with
great
delight
-LRB-
surveying
one
small
*NL*
atom
of
a
bone
upon
the
dish
-RRB-
,
they
had
n't
ate
it
all
at
last
!
Yet
every
*NL*
one
had
had
enough
,
and
the
youngest
Cratchits
,
in
particular
,
were
*NL*
steeped
in
sage
and
onion
to
the
eyebrows
!
But
now
,
the
plates
being
*NL*
changed
by
Miss
Belinda
,
Mrs.
Cratchit
left
the
room
alone
--
too
nervous
*NL*
to
bear
witnesses
--
to
take
the
pudding
up
,
and
bring
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suppose
it
should
not
be
done
enough
!
Suppose
it
should
break
in
turning
*NL*
out
!
Suppose
somebody
should
have
got
over
the
wall
of
the
back-yard
and
*NL*
stolen
it
,
while
they
were
merry
with
the
goose
--
a
supposition
at
which
*NL*
the
two
young
Cratchits
became
livid
!
All
sorts
of
horrors
were
*NL*
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hallo
!
A
great
deal
of
steam
!
The
pudding
was
out
of
the
copper
.
A
smell
*NL*
like
a
washing-day
!
That
was
the
cloth
.
A
smell
like
an
eating-house
and
*NL*
a
pastrycook
's
next
door
to
each
other
,
with
a
laundress
's
next
door
to
*NL*
that
!
That
was
the
pudding
!
In
half
a
minute
Mrs.
Cratchit
*NL*
entered
--
flushed
,
but
smiling
proudly
--
with
the
pudding
,
like
a
speckled
*NL*
cannon-ball
,
so
hard
and
firm
,
blazing
in
half
of
half-a-quartern
of
*NL*
ignited
brandy
,
and
bedight
with
Christmas
holly
stuck
into
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
a
wonderful
pudding
!
Bob
Cratchit
said
,
and
calmly
too
,
that
he
*NL*
regarded
it
as
the
greatest
success
achieved
by
Mrs.
Cratchit
since
*NL*
their
marriage
.
Mrs.
Cratchit
said
that
,
now
the
weight
was
off
her
*NL*
mind
,
she
would
confess
she
had
her
doubts
about
the
quantity
of
flour
.
*NL*
Everybody
had
something
to
say
about
it
,
but
nobody
said
or
thought
it
*NL*
was
at
all
a
small
pudding
for
a
large
family
.
It
would
have
been
flat
*NL*
heresy
to
do
so
.
Any
Cratchit
would
have
blushed
to
hint
at
such
a
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
dinner
was
all
done
,
the
cloth
was
cleared
,
the
hearth
*NL*
swept
,
and
the
fire
made
up
.
The
compound
in
the
jug
being
tasted
,
and
*NL*
considered
perfect
,
apples
and
oranges
were
put
upon
the
table
,
and
a
*NL*
shovel
full
of
chestnuts
on
the
fire
.
Then
all
the
Cratchit
family
drew
*NL*
round
the
hearth
in
what
Bob
Cratchit
called
a
circle
,
meaning
half
a
*NL*
one
;
and
at
Bob
Cratchit
's
elbow
stood
the
family
display
of
glass
.
Two
*NL*
tumblers
and
a
custard
cup
without
a
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
held
the
hot
stuff
from
the
jug
,
however
,
as
well
as
golden
*NL*
goblets
would
have
done
;
and
Bob
served
it
out
with
beaming
looks
,
while
*NL*
the
chestnuts
on
the
fire
sputtered
and
cracked
noisily
.
Then
Bob
*NL*
proposed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
merry
Christmas
to
us
all
,
my
dears
.
God
bless
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
all
the
family
re-echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
us
every
one
!
''
said
Tiny
Tim
,
the
last
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
very
close
to
his
father
's
side
,
upon
his
little
stool
.
Bob
held
*NL*
his
withered
little
hand
in
his
,
as
if
he
loved
the
child
,
and
wished
to
*NL*
keep
him
by
his
side
,
and
dreaded
that
he
might
be
taken
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
,
''
said
Scrooge
with
an
interest
he
had
never
felt
before
,
``
tell
*NL*
me
if
Tiny
Tim
will
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
a
vacant
seat
,
''
replied
the
Ghost
,
``
in
the
poor
chimney-corner
,
*NL*
and
a
crutch
without
an
owner
,
carefully
preserved
.
If
these
shadows
*NL*
remain
unaltered
by
the
Future
,
the
child
will
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
kind
Spirit
!
say
he
will
be
spared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
these
shadows
remain
unaltered
by
the
Future
,
none
other
of
my
*NL*
race
,
''
returned
the
Ghost
,
``
will
find
him
here
.
What
then
?
If
he
be
like
*NL*
to
die
,
he
had
better
do
it
,
and
decrease
the
surplus
population
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
hung
his
head
to
hear
his
own
words
quoted
by
the
Spirit
,
and
*NL*
was
overcome
with
penitence
and
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
,
''
said
the
Ghost
,
``
if
man
you
be
in
heart
,
not
adamant
,
forbear
*NL*
that
wicked
cant
until
you
have
discovered
What
the
surplus
is
,
and
*NL*
Where
it
is
.
Will
you
decide
what
men
shall
live
,
what
men
shall
die
?
It
*NL*
may
be
that
,
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
,
you
are
more
worthless
and
less
fit
*NL*
to
live
than
millions
like
this
poor
man
's
child
.
Oh
God
!
to
hear
the
*NL*
Insect
on
the
leaf
pronouncing
on
the
too
much
life
among
his
hungry
*NL*
brothers
in
the
dust
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
bent
before
the
Ghost
's
rebuke
,
and
,
trembling
,
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
upon
the
ground
.
But
he
raised
them
speedily
on
hearing
his
own
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Scrooge
!
''
said
Bob
.
``
I
'll
give
you
Mr.
Scrooge
,
the
Founder
of
the
*NL*
Feast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Founder
of
the
Feast
,
indeed
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Cratchit
,
reddening
.
``
I
*NL*
wish
I
had
him
here
.
I
'd
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
to
feast
upon
,
and
*NL*
I
hope
he
'd
have
a
good
appetite
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Bob
,
``
the
children
!
Christmas-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
should
be
Christmas-day
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
she
,
``
on
which
one
drinks
*NL*
the
health
of
such
an
odious
,
stingy
,
hard
,
unfeeling
man
as
Mr.
*NL*
Scrooge
.
You
know
he
is
,
Robert
!
Nobody
knows
it
better
than
you
do
,
*NL*
poor
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
was
Bob
's
mild
answer
.
``
Christmas-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
drink
his
health
for
your
sake
and
the
Day
's
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cratchit
,
*NL*
``
not
for
his
.
Long
life
to
him
!
A
merry
Christmas
and
a
happy
New
Year
!
*NL*
He
'll
be
very
merry
and
very
happy
,
I
have
no
doubt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
drank
the
toast
after
her
.
It
was
the
first
of
their
*NL*
proceedings
which
had
no
heartiness
in
it
.
Tiny
Tim
drank
it
last
of
*NL*
all
,
but
he
did
n't
care
twopence
for
it
.
Scrooge
was
the
Ogre
of
the
*NL*
family
.
The
mention
of
his
name
cast
a
dark
shadow
on
the
party
,
which
*NL*
was
not
dispelled
for
full
five
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
it
had
passed
away
they
were
ten
times
merrier
than
before
,
from
*NL*
the
mere
relief
of
Scrooge
the
Baleful
being
done
with
.
Bob
Cratchit
*NL*
told
them
how
he
had
a
situation
in
his
eye
for
Master
Peter
,
which
*NL*
would
bring
in
,
if
obtained
,
full
five-and-sixpence
weekly
.
The
two
*NL*
young
Cratchits
laughed
tremendously
at
the
idea
of
Peter
's
being
a
man
*NL*
of
business
;
and
Peter
himself
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
from
*NL*
between
his
collars
,
as
if
he
were
deliberating
what
particular
*NL*
investments
he
should
favour
when
he
came
into
the
receipt
of
that
*NL*
bewildering
income
.
Martha
,
who
was
a
poor
apprentice
at
a
milliner
's
,
*NL*
then
told
them
what
kind
of
work
she
had
to
do
,
and
how
many
hours
she
*NL*
worked
at
a
stretch
,
and
how
she
meant
to
lie
abed
to-morrow
morning
for
*NL*
a
good
long
rest
;
to-morrow
being
a
holiday
she
passed
at
home
.
Also
how
*NL*
she
had
seen
a
countess
and
a
lord
some
days
before
,
and
how
the
lord
*NL*
``
was
much
about
as
tall
as
Peter
''
;
at
which
Peter
pulled
up
his
collars
*NL*
so
high
,
that
you
could
n't
have
seen
his
head
if
you
had
been
there
.
All
*NL*
this
time
the
chestnuts
and
the
jug
went
round
and
round
;
and
by-and-by
*NL*
they
had
a
song
,
about
a
lost
child
travelling
in
the
snow
,
from
Tiny
*NL*
Tim
,
who
had
a
plaintive
little
voice
,
and
sang
it
very
well
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
of
high
mark
in
this
.
They
were
not
a
handsome
family
;
*NL*
they
were
not
well
dressed
;
their
shoes
were
far
from
being
waterproof
;
*NL*
their
clothes
were
scanty
;
and
Peter
might
have
known
,
and
very
likely
*NL*
did
,
the
inside
of
a
pawn-broker
's
.
But
they
were
happy
,
grateful
,
*NL*
pleased
with
one
another
,
and
contented
with
the
time
;
and
when
they
*NL*
faded
,
and
looked
happier
yet
in
the
bright
sprinklings
of
the
Spirit
's
*NL*
torch
at
parting
,
Scrooge
had
his
eye
upon
them
,
and
especially
on
Tiny
*NL*
Tim
,
until
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
it
was
getting
dark
,
and
snowing
pretty
heavily
;
and
as
*NL*
Scrooge
and
the
Spirit
went
along
the
streets
,
the
brightness
of
the
*NL*
roaring
fires
in
kitchens
,
parlours
,
and
all
sorts
of
rooms
was
*NL*
wonderful
.
Here
,
the
flickering
of
the
blaze
showed
preparations
for
a
*NL*
cosy
dinner
,
with
hot
plates
baking
through
and
through
before
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
deep
red
curtains
,
ready
to
be
drawn
to
shut
out
cold
and
darkness
.
*NL*
There
,
all
the
children
of
the
house
were
running
out
into
the
snow
to
*NL*
meet
their
married
sisters
,
brothers
,
cousins
,
uncles
,
aunts
,
and
be
the
*NL*
first
to
greet
them
.
Here
,
again
,
were
shadows
on
the
window
blinds
of
*NL*
guests
assembling
;
and
there
a
group
of
handsome
girls
,
all
hooded
and
*NL*
fur-booted
,
and
all
chattering
at
once
,
tripped
lightly
off
to
some
near
*NL*
neighbour
's
house
;
where
,
woe
upon
the
single
man
who
saw
them
*NL*
enter
--
artful
witches
,
well
they
knew
it
--
in
a
glow
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
if
you
had
judged
from
the
numbers
of
people
on
their
way
to
*NL*
friendly
gatherings
,
you
might
have
thought
that
no
one
was
at
home
to
*NL*
give
them
welcome
when
they
got
there
,
instead
of
every
house
expecting
*NL*
company
,
and
piling
up
its
fires
half-chimney
high
.
Blessings
on
it
,
how
*NL*
the
Ghost
exulted
!
How
it
bared
its
breadth
of
breast
,
and
opened
its
*NL*
capacious
palm
,
and
floated
on
,
outpouring
,
with
a
generous
hand
,
its
*NL*
bright
and
harmless
mirth
on
everything
within
its
reach
!
The
very
*NL*
lamp-lighter
,
who
ran
on
before
,
dotting
the
dusky
street
with
specks
of
*NL*
light
,
and
who
was
dressed
to
spend
the
evening
somewhere
,
laughed
out
*NL*
loudly
as
the
Spirit
passed
,
though
little
kenned
the
lamp-lighter
that
*NL*
he
had
any
company
but
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
without
a
word
of
warning
from
the
Ghost
,
they
stood
upon
a
*NL*
bleak
and
desert
moor
,
where
monstrous
masses
of
rude
stone
were
cast
*NL*
about
,
as
though
it
were
the
burial-place
or
giants
;
and
water
spread
*NL*
itself
wheresoever
it
listed
;
or
would
have
done
so
,
but
for
the
frost
*NL*
that
held
it
prisoner
;
and
nothing
grew
but
moss
and
furze
,
and
coarse
,
*NL*
rank
grass
.
Down
in
the
west
the
setting
sun
had
left
a
streak
of
fiery
*NL*
red
,
which
glared
upon
the
desolation
for
an
instant
,
like
a
sullen
eye
,
*NL*
and
,
frowning
lower
,
lower
,
lower
yet
,
was
lost
in
the
thick
gloom
of
*NL*
darkest
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
place
is
this
?
''
asked
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
place
where
Miners
live
,
who
labour
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
Spirit
.
``
But
they
know
me
.
See
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
shone
from
the
window
of
a
hut
,
and
swiftly
they
advanced
*NL*
towards
it
.
Passing
through
the
wall
of
mud
and
stone
,
they
found
a
*NL*
cheerful
company
assembled
round
a
glowing
fire
.
An
old
,
old
man
and
*NL*
woman
,
with
their
children
and
their
children
's
children
,
and
another
*NL*
generation
beyond
that
,
all
decked
out
gaily
in
their
holiday
attire
.
*NL*
The
old
man
,
in
a
voice
that
seldom
rose
above
the
howling
of
the
wind
*NL*
upon
the
barren
waste
,
was
singing
them
a
Christmas
song
;
it
had
been
a
*NL*
very
old
song
when
he
was
a
boy
;
and
from
time
to
time
they
all
joined
*NL*
in
the
chorus
.
So
surely
as
they
raised
their
voices
,
the
old
man
got
*NL*
quite
blithe
and
loud
;
and
,
so
surely
as
they
stopped
,
his
vigour
sank
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
did
not
tarry
here
,
but
bade
Scrooge
hold
his
robe
,
and
,
*NL*
passing
on
above
the
moor
,
sped
whither
?
Not
to
sea
?
To
sea
.
To
*NL*
Scrooge
's
horror
,
looking
back
,
he
saw
the
last
of
the
land
,
a
frightful
*NL*
range
of
rocks
,
behind
them
;
and
his
ears
were
deafened
by
the
*NL*
thundering
of
water
,
as
it
rolled
and
roared
,
and
raged
among
the
*NL*
dreadful
caverns
it
had
worn
,
and
fiercely
tried
to
undermine
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Built
upon
a
dismal
reef
of
sunken
rocks
,
some
league
or
so
from
shore
,
*NL*
on
which
the
waters
chafed
and
dashed
,
the
wild
year
through
,
there
*NL*
stood
a
solitary
lighthouse
.
Great
heaps
of
seaweed
clung
to
its
base
,
*NL*
and
storm-birds
--
born
of
the
wind
,
one
might
suppose
,
as
seaweed
of
the
*NL*
water
--
rose
and
fell
about
it
,
like
the
waves
they
skimmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
even
here
,
two
men
who
watched
the
light
had
made
a
fire
that
*NL*
through
the
loophole
in
the
thick
stone
wall
shed
out
a
ray
of
*NL*
brightness
on
the
awful
sea
.
Joining
their
horny
hands
over
the
rough
*NL*
table
at
which
they
sat
,
they
wished
each
other
Merry
Christmas
in
their
*NL*
can
of
grog
;
and
one
of
them
,
the
elder
too
,
with
his
face
all
damaged
*NL*
and
scarred
with
hard
weather
,
as
the
figure-head
of
an
old
ship
might
*NL*
be
,
struck
up
a
sturdy
song
that
was
like
a
gale
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
Ghost
sped
on
,
above
the
black
and
heaving
sea
--
on
,
on
--
until
,
*NL*
being
far
away
,
as
he
told
Scrooge
,
from
any
shore
,
they
lighted
on
a
*NL*
ship
.
They
stood
beside
the
helmsman
at
the
wheel
,
the
look-out
in
the
*NL*
bow
,
the
officers
who
had
the
watch
;
dark
,
ghostly
figures
in
their
*NL*
several
stations
;
but
every
man
among
them
hummed
a
Christmas
tune
,
or
*NL*
had
a
Christmas
thought
,
or
spoke
below
his
breath
to
his
companion
of
*NL*
some
bygone
Christmas-day
,
with
homeward
hopes
belonging
to
it
.
And
*NL*
every
man
on
board
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
good
or
bad
,
had
had
a
kinder
*NL*
word
for
one
another
on
that
day
than
on
any
day
in
the
year
;
and
had
*NL*
shared
to
some
extent
in
its
festivities
;
and
had
remembered
those
he
*NL*
cared
for
at
a
distance
,
and
had
known
that
they
delighted
to
remember
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
surprise
to
Scrooge
,
while
listening
to
the
moaning
of
*NL*
the
wind
,
and
thinking
what
a
solemn
thing
it
was
to
move
on
through
the
*NL*
lonely
darkness
over
an
unknown
abyss
,
whose
depths
were
secrets
as
*NL*
profound
as
death
:
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
Scrooge
,
while
thus
*NL*
engaged
,
to
hear
a
hearty
laugh
.
It
was
a
much
greater
surprise
to
*NL*
Scrooge
to
recognise
it
as
his
own
nephew
's
,
and
to
find
himself
in
a
*NL*
bright
,
dry
,
gleaming
room
,
with
the
Spirit
standing
smiling
by
his
*NL*
side
,
and
looking
at
that
same
nephew
with
approving
affability
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
''
laughed
Scrooge
's
nephew
.
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
should
happen
,
by
any
unlikely
chance
,
to
know
a
man
more
blessed
*NL*
in
a
laugh
than
Scrooge
's
nephew
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
him
too
.
Introduce
him
to
me
,
and
I
'll
cultivate
his
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
fair
,
even-handed
,
noble
adjustment
of
things
,
that
,
while
there
*NL*
is
infection
in
disease
and
sorrow
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
*NL*
irresistibly
contagious
as
laughter
and
good-humour
.
When
Scrooge
's
*NL*
nephew
laughed
in
this
way
,
holding
his
sides
,
rolling
his
head
,
and
*NL*
twisting
his
face
into
the
most
extravagant
contortions
,
Scrooge
's
*NL*
niece
,
by
marriage
,
laughed
as
heartily
as
he
.
And
their
assembled
*NL*
friends
,
being
not
a
bit
behindhand
,
roared
out
lustily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
that
Christmas
was
a
humbug
,
as
I
live
!
''
cried
Scrooge
's
*NL*
nephew
.
``
He
believed
it
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
shame
for
him
,
Fred
!
''
said
Scrooge
's
niece
indignantly
.
Bless
*NL*
those
women
!
they
never
do
anything
by
halves
.
They
are
always
in
*NL*
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
pretty
;
exceedingly
pretty
.
With
a
dimpled
,
*NL*
surprised-looking
,
capital
face
;
a
ripe
little
mouth
,
that
seemed
made
*NL*
to
be
kissed
--
as
no
doubt
it
was
;
all
kinds
of
good
little
dots
about
*NL*
her
chin
,
that
melted
into
one
another
when
she
laughed
;
and
the
*NL*
sunniest
pair
of
eyes
you
ever
saw
in
any
little
creature
's
head
.
*NL*
Altogether
she
was
what
you
would
have
called
provoking
,
you
know
;
but
*NL*
satisfactory
,
too
.
Oh
,
perfectly
satisfactory
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
comical
old
fellow
,
''
said
Scrooge
's
nephew
,
``
that
's
the
truth
;
*NL*
and
not
so
pleasant
as
he
might
be
.
However
,
his
offences
carry
their
*NL*
own
punishment
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
he
is
very
rich
,
Fred
,
''
hinted
Scrooge
's
niece
.
``
At
least
,
you
*NL*
always
tell
_
me
_
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
that
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Scrooge
's
nephew
.
``
His
wealth
is
of
no
use
*NL*
to
him
.
He
do
n't
do
any
good
with
it
.
He
do
n't
make
himself
comfortable
*NL*
with
it
.
He
has
n't
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
--
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
--
that
he
is
*NL*
ever
going
to
benefit
Us
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
patience
with
him
,
''
observed
Scrooge
's
niece
.
Scrooge
's
*NL*
niece
's
sisters
,
and
all
the
other
ladies
,
expressed
the
same
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
!
''
said
Scrooge
's
nephew
.
``
I
am
sorry
for
him
;
I
could
n't
be
*NL*
angry
with
him
if
I
tried
.
Who
suffers
by
his
ill
whims
?
Himself
always
.
*NL*
Here
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
dislike
us
,
and
he
wo
n't
come
and
dine
*NL*
with
us
.
What
's
the
consequence
?
He
do
n't
lose
much
of
a
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
think
he
loses
a
very
good
dinner
,
''
interrupted
Scrooge
's
*NL*
niece
.
Everybody
else
said
the
same
,
and
they
must
be
allowed
to
have
*NL*
been
competent
judges
,
because
they
had
just
had
dinner
;
and
,
with
the
*NL*
dessert
upon
the
table
,
were
clustered
round
the
fire
,
by
lamp-light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
''
said
Scrooge
's
nephew
,
``
because
I
*NL*
have
n't
any
great
faith
in
these
young
housekeepers
.
What
do
_
you
_
say
,
*NL*
Topper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Topper
had
clearly
got
his
eye
upon
one
of
Scrooge
's
niece
's
sisters
,
*NL*
for
he
answered
that
a
bachelor
was
a
wretched
outcast
,
who
had
no
right
*NL*
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject
.
Whereat
Scrooge
's
niece
's
*NL*
sister
--
the
plump
one
with
the
lace
tucker
,
not
the
one
with
the
*NL*
roses
--
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
go
on
,
Fred
,
''
said
Scrooge
's
niece
,
clapping
her
hands
.
``
He
never
*NL*
finishes
what
he
begins
to
say
!
He
is
such
a
ridiculous
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
's
nephew
revelled
in
another
laugh
,
and
,
as
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
keep
the
infection
off
,
though
the
plump
sister
tried
hard
to
do
it
with
*NL*
aromatic
vinegar
,
his
example
was
unanimously
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
only
going
to
say
,
''
said
Scrooge
's
nephew
,
``
that
the
consequence
*NL*
of
his
taking
a
dislike
to
us
,
and
not
making
merry
with
us
,
is
,
as
I
*NL*
think
,
that
he
loses
some
pleasant
moments
,
which
could
do
him
no
harm
.
*NL*
I
am
sure
he
loses
pleasanter
companions
than
he
can
find
in
his
own
*NL*
thoughts
,
either
in
his
mouldy
old
office
or
his
dusty
chambers
.
I
mean
*NL*
to
give
him
the
same
chance
every
year
,
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
,
for
*NL*
I
pity
him
.
He
may
rail
at
Christmas
till
he
dies
,
but
he
ca
n't
help
*NL*
thinking
better
of
it
--
I
defy
him
--
if
he
finds
me
going
there
in
good
*NL*
temper
,
year
after
year
,
and
saying
,
`
Uncle
Scrooge
,
how
are
you
?
'
If
it
*NL*
only
puts
him
in
the
vein
to
leave
his
poor
clerk
fifty
pounds
,
_
that
's
_
*NL*
something
;
and
I
think
I
shook
him
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
their
turn
to
laugh
,
now
,
at
the
notion
of
his
shaking
Scrooge
.
*NL*
But
,
being
thoroughly
good-natured
,
and
not
much
caring
what
they
*NL*
laughed
at
,
so
that
they
laughed
at
any
rate
,
he
encouraged
them
in
*NL*
their
merriment
,
and
passed
the
bottle
,
joyously
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
they
had
some
music
.
For
they
were
a
musical
family
,
and
knew
*NL*
what
they
were
about
when
they
sung
a
Glee
or
Catch
,
I
can
assure
you
:
*NL*
especially
Topper
,
who
could
growl
away
in
the
bass
like
a
good
one
,
and
*NL*
never
swell
the
large
veins
in
his
forehead
,
or
get
red
in
the
face
over
*NL*
it
.
Scrooge
's
niece
played
well
upon
the
harp
;
and
played
,
among
other
*NL*
tunes
,
a
simple
little
air
-LRB-
a
mere
nothing
:
you
might
learn
to
whistle
*NL*
it
in
two
minutes
-RRB-
,
which
had
been
familiar
to
the
child
who
fetched
*NL*
Scrooge
from
the
boarding-school
,
as
he
had
been
reminded
by
the
Ghost
*NL*
of
Christmas
Past
.
When
this
strain
of
music
sounded
,
all
the
things
*NL*
that
Ghost
had
shown
him
came
upon
his
mind
;
he
softened
more
and
more
;
*NL*
and
thought
that
if
he
could
have
listened
to
it
often
,
years
ago
,
he
*NL*
might
have
cultivated
the
kindnesses
of
life
for
his
own
happiness
with
*NL*
his
own
hands
,
without
resorting
to
the
sexton
's
spade
that
buried
Jacob
*NL*
Marley
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
did
n't
devote
the
whole
evening
to
music
.
After
awhile
they
*NL*
played
at
forfeits
;
for
it
is
good
to
be
children
sometimes
,
and
never
*NL*
better
than
at
Christmas
,
when
its
mighty
Founder
was
a
child
himself
.
*NL*
Stop
!
There
was
first
a
game
at
blindman
's
buff
.
Of
course
there
was
.
*NL*
And
I
no
more
believe
Topper
was
really
blind
than
I
believe
he
had
eyes
*NL*
in
his
boots
.
My
opinion
is
,
that
it
was
a
done
thing
between
him
and
*NL*
Scrooge
's
nephew
;
and
that
the
Ghost
of
Christmas
Present
knew
it
.
The
*NL*
way
he
went
after
that
plump
sister
in
the
lace
tucker
was
an
outrage
on
*NL*
the
credulity
of
human
nature
.
Knocking
down
the
fire-irons
,
tumbling
*NL*
over
the
chairs
,
bumping
up
against
the
piano
,
smothering
himself
*NL*
amongst
the
curtains
,
wherever
she
went
,
there
went
he
!
He
always
knew
*NL*
where
the
plump
sister
was
.
He
would
n't
catch
anybody
else
.
If
you
had
*NL*
fallen
up
against
him
-LRB-
as
some
of
them
did
-RRB-
on
purpose
,
he
would
have
*NL*
made
a
feint
of
endeavouring
to
seize
you
,
which
would
have
been
an
*NL*
affront
to
your
understanding
,
and
would
instantly
have
sidled
off
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
plump
sister
.
She
often
cried
out
that
it
was
n't
*NL*
fair
;
and
it
really
was
not
.
But
when
,
at
last
,
he
caught
her
;
when
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
her
silken
rustlings
,
and
her
rapid
flutterings
past
him
,
*NL*
he
got
her
into
a
corner
whence
there
was
no
escape
,
then
his
conduct
*NL*
was
the
most
execrable
.
For
his
pretending
not
to
know
her
;
his
*NL*
pretending
that
it
was
necessary
to
touch
her
head-dress
,
and
further
to
*NL*
assure
himself
of
her
identity
by
pressing
a
certain
ring
upon
her
*NL*
finger
,
and
a
certain
chain
about
her
neck
,
was
vile
,
monstrous
!
No
*NL*
doubt
she
told
him
her
opinion
of
it
when
,
another
blind
man
being
in
*NL*
office
,
they
were
so
very
confidential
together
behind
the
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
's
niece
was
not
one
of
the
blindman
's
buff
party
,
but
was
made
*NL*
comfortable
with
a
large
chair
and
a
footstool
,
in
a
snug
corner
where
*NL*
the
Ghost
and
Scrooge
were
close
behind
her
.
But
she
joined
in
the
*NL*
forfeits
,
and
loved
her
love
to
admiration
with
all
the
letters
of
the
*NL*
alphabet
.
Likewise
at
the
game
of
How
,
When
,
and
Where
,
she
was
very
*NL*
great
,
and
,
to
the
secret
joy
of
Scrooge
's
nephew
,
beat
her
sisters
*NL*
hollow
:
though
they
were
sharp
girls
too
,
as
Topper
could
have
told
you
.
*NL*
There
might
have
been
twenty
people
there
,
young
and
old
,
but
they
all
*NL*
played
,
and
so
did
Scrooge
;
for
,
wholly
forgetting
,
in
the
interest
he
*NL*
had
in
what
was
going
on
,
that
his
voice
made
no
sound
in
their
ears
,
he
*NL*
sometimes
came
out
with
his
guess
quite
loud
,
and
very
often
guessed
*NL*
right
,
too
,
for
the
sharpest
needle
,
best
Whitechapel
,
warranted
not
to
*NL*
cut
in
the
eye
,
was
not
sharper
than
Scrooge
;
blunt
as
he
took
it
in
his
*NL*
head
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
was
greatly
pleased
to
find
him
in
this
mood
,
and
looked
upon
*NL*
him
with
such
favour
,
that
he
begged
like
a
boy
to
be
allowed
to
stay
*NL*
until
the
guests
departed
.
But
this
the
Spirit
said
could
not
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
new
game
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
One
half-hour
,
Spirit
,
only
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
game
called
Yes
and
No
,
where
Scrooge
's
nephew
had
to
think
of
*NL*
something
,
and
the
rest
must
find
out
what
;
he
only
answering
to
their
*NL*
questions
yes
or
no
,
as
the
case
was
.
The
brisk
fire
of
questioning
to
*NL*
which
he
was
exposed
elicited
from
him
that
he
was
thinking
of
an
*NL*
animal
,
a
live
animal
,
rather
a
disagreeable
animal
,
a
savage
animal
,
an
*NL*
animal
that
growled
and
grunted
sometimes
,
and
talked
sometimes
,
and
*NL*
lived
in
London
,
and
walked
about
the
streets
,
and
was
n't
made
a
show
*NL*
of
,
and
was
n't
led
by
anybody
,
and
did
n't
live
in
a
menagerie
,
and
was
*NL*
never
killed
in
a
market
,
and
was
not
a
horse
,
or
an
ass
,
or
a
cow
,
or
a
*NL*
bull
,
or
a
tiger
,
or
a
dog
,
or
a
pig
,
or
a
cat
,
or
a
bear
.
At
every
*NL*
fresh
question
that
was
put
to
him
,
this
nephew
burst
into
a
fresh
roar
*NL*
of
laughter
;
and
was
so
inexpressibly
tickled
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
*NL*
get
up
off
the
sofa
,
and
stamp
.
At
last
the
plump
sister
,
falling
into
a
*NL*
similar
state
,
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
it
out
!
I
know
what
it
is
,
Fred
!
I
know
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
your
uncle
Scro-o-o-o-oge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
it
certainly
was
.
Admiration
was
the
universal
sentiment
,
though
*NL*
some
objected
that
the
reply
to
``
Is
it
a
bear
?
''
ought
to
have
been
*NL*
``
Yes
''
:
inasmuch
as
an
answer
in
the
negative
was
sufficient
to
have
*NL*
diverted
their
thoughts
from
Mr.
Scrooge
,
supposing
they
had
ever
had
*NL*
any
tendency
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
given
us
plenty
of
merriment
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Fred
,
``
and
it
*NL*
would
be
ungrateful
not
to
drink
his
health
.
Here
is
a
glass
of
mulled
*NL*
wine
ready
to
our
hand
at
the
moment
;
and
I
say
,
`
Uncle
Scrooge
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Uncle
Scrooge
!
''
they
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
merry
Christmas
and
a
happy
New
Year
to
the
old
man
,
whatever
he
is
!
''
*NL*
said
Scrooge
's
nephew
.
``
He
would
n't
take
it
from
me
,
but
may
he
have
it
*NL*
nevertheless
.
Uncle
Scrooge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Scrooge
had
imperceptibly
become
so
gay
and
light
of
heart
,
that
*NL*
he
would
have
pledged
the
unconscious
company
in
return
,
and
thanked
*NL*
them
in
an
inaudible
speech
,
if
the
Ghost
had
given
him
time
.
But
the
*NL*
whole
scene
passed
off
in
the
breath
of
the
last
word
spoken
by
his
*NL*
nephew
;
and
he
and
the
Spirit
were
again
upon
their
travels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
they
saw
,
and
far
they
went
,
and
many
homes
they
visited
,
but
*NL*
always
with
a
happy
end
.
The
Spirit
stood
beside
sick-beds
,
and
they
*NL*
were
cheerful
;
on
foreign
lands
,
and
they
were
close
at
home
;
by
*NL*
struggling
men
,
and
they
were
patient
in
their
greater
hope
;
by
poverty
,
*NL*
and
it
was
rich
.
In
almshouse
,
hospital
,
and
gaol
,
in
misery
's
every
*NL*
refuge
,
where
vain
man
in
his
little
brief
authority
had
not
made
fast
*NL*
the
door
,
and
barred
the
Spirit
out
,
he
left
his
blessing
,
and
taught
*NL*
Scrooge
his
precepts
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
night
,
if
it
were
only
a
night
;
but
Scrooge
had
his
doubts
*NL*
of
this
,
because
the
Christmas
holidays
appeared
to
be
condensed
into
*NL*
the
space
of
time
they
passed
together
.
It
was
strange
,
too
,
that
,
while
*NL*
Scrooge
remained
unaltered
in
his
outward
form
,
the
Ghost
grew
older
,
*NL*
clearly
older
.
Scrooge
had
observed
this
change
,
but
never
spoke
of
it
,
*NL*
until
they
left
a
children
's
Twelfth-Night
party
,
when
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
Spirit
as
they
stood
together
in
an
open
place
,
he
noticed
that
its
hair
*NL*
was
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
spirits
'
lives
so
short
?
''
asked
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
upon
this
globe
is
very
brief
,
''
replied
the
Ghost
.
``
It
ends
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-night
!
''
cried
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-night
at
midnight
.
Hark
!
The
time
is
drawing
near
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chimes
were
ringing
the
three-quarters
past
eleven
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
if
I
am
not
justified
in
what
I
ask
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
looking
*NL*
intently
at
the
Spirit
's
robe
,
``
but
I
see
something
strange
,
and
not
*NL*
belonging
to
yourself
,
protruding
from
your
skirts
.
Is
it
a
foot
or
a
*NL*
claw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
a
claw
,
for
the
flesh
there
is
upon
it
,
''
was
the
Spirit
's
*NL*
sorrowful
reply
.
``
Look
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
foldings
of
its
robe
it
brought
two
children
;
wretched
,
abject
,
*NL*
frightful
,
hideous
,
miserable
.
They
knelt
down
at
its
feet
,
and
clung
*NL*
upon
the
outside
of
its
garment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Man
!
look
here
!
Look
,
look
,
down
here
!
''
exclaimed
the
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
boy
and
girl
.
Yellow
,
meagre
,
ragged
,
scowling
,
wolfish
;
but
*NL*
prostrate
,
too
,
in
their
humility
.
Where
graceful
youth
should
have
*NL*
filled
their
features
out
,
and
touched
them
with
its
freshest
tints
,
a
*NL*
stale
and
shrivelled
hand
,
like
that
of
age
,
had
pinched
,
and
twisted
*NL*
them
,
and
pulled
them
into
shreds
.
Where
angels
might
have
sat
*NL*
enthroned
,
devils
lurked
,
and
glared
out
menacing
.
No
change
,
no
*NL*
degradation
,
no
perversion
of
humanity
,
in
any
grade
,
through
all
the
*NL*
mysteries
of
wonderful
creation
,
has
monsters
half
so
horrible
and
*NL*
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
started
back
,
appalled
.
Having
them
shown
to
him
in
this
way
,
he
*NL*
tried
to
say
they
were
fine
children
,
but
the
words
choked
themselves
,
*NL*
rather
than
be
parties
to
a
lie
of
such
enormous
magnitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
are
they
yours
?
''
Scrooge
could
say
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
Man
's
,
''
said
the
Spirit
,
looking
down
upon
them
.
``
And
they
*NL*
cling
to
me
,
appealing
from
their
fathers
.
This
boy
is
Ignorance
.
This
*NL*
girl
is
Want
.
Beware
of
them
both
,
and
all
of
their
degree
,
but
most
of
*NL*
all
beware
this
boy
,
for
on
his
brow
I
see
that
written
which
is
Doom
,
*NL*
unless
the
writing
be
erased
.
Deny
it
!
''
cried
the
Spirit
,
stretching
out
*NL*
its
hand
towards
the
city
.
``
Slander
those
who
tell
it
ye
!
Admit
it
for
*NL*
your
factious
purposes
,
and
make
it
worse
!
And
bide
the
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
no
refuge
or
resource
?
''
cried
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
no
prisons
?
''
said
the
Spirit
,
turning
on
him
for
the
last
*NL*
time
with
his
own
words
.
``
Are
there
no
workhouses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
struck
Twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
looked
about
him
for
the
Ghost
,
and
saw
it
not
.
As
the
last
*NL*
stroke
ceased
to
vibrate
,
he
remembered
the
prediction
of
old
Jacob
*NL*
Marley
,
and
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
beheld
a
solemn
Phantom
,
draped
and
*NL*
hooded
,
coming
like
a
mist
along
the
ground
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
STAVE
FOUR
*NL*
*NL*
THE
LAST
OF
THE
SPIRITS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Phantom
slowly
,
gravely
,
silently
approached
.
When
it
came
near
him
,
*NL*
Scrooge
bent
down
upon
his
knee
;
for
in
the
very
air
through
which
this
*NL*
Spirit
moved
it
seemed
to
scatter
gloom
and
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
shrouded
in
a
deep
black
garment
,
which
concealed
its
head
,
its
*NL*
face
,
its
form
,
and
left
nothing
of
it
visible
,
save
one
outstretched
*NL*
hand
.
But
for
this
,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
detach
its
figure
*NL*
from
the
night
,
and
separate
it
from
the
darkness
by
which
it
was
*NL*
surrounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
it
was
tall
and
stately
when
it
came
beside
him
,
and
that
*NL*
its
mysterious
presence
filled
him
with
a
solemn
dread
.
He
knew
no
more
,
*NL*
for
the
Spirit
neither
spoke
nor
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
the
presence
of
the
Ghost
of
Christmas
Yet
to
Come
?
''
said
*NL*
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
answered
not
,
but
pointed
onward
with
its
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
about
to
show
me
shadows
of
the
things
that
have
not
happened
,
*NL*
but
will
happen
in
the
time
before
us
,
''
Scrooge
pursued
.
``
Is
that
so
,
*NL*
Spirit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
upper
portion
of
the
garment
was
contracted
for
an
instant
in
its
*NL*
folds
,
as
if
the
Spirit
had
inclined
its
head
.
That
was
the
only
answer
*NL*
he
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
well
used
to
ghostly
company
by
this
time
,
Scrooge
feared
the
*NL*
silent
shape
so
much
that
his
legs
trembled
beneath
him
,
and
he
found
*NL*
that
he
could
hardly
stand
when
he
prepared
to
follow
it
.
The
Spirit
*NL*
paused
a
moment
,
as
observing
his
condition
,
and
giving
him
time
to
*NL*
recover
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Scrooge
was
all
the
worse
for
this
.
It
thrilled
him
with
a
vague
*NL*
uncertain
horror
to
know
that
,
behind
the
dusky
shroud
,
there
were
*NL*
ghostly
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
him
,
while
he
,
though
he
stretched
his
*NL*
own
to
the
utmost
,
could
see
nothing
but
a
spectral
hand
and
one
great
*NL*
heap
of
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ghost
of
the
Future
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
I
fear
you
more
than
any
spectre
I
*NL*
have
seen
.
But
,
as
I
know
your
purpose
is
to
do
me
good
,
and
as
I
hope
*NL*
to
live
to
be
another
man
from
what
I
was
,
I
am
prepared
to
bear
you
*NL*
company
,
and
do
it
with
a
thankful
heart
.
Will
you
not
speak
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
him
no
reply
.
The
hand
was
pointed
straight
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lead
on
!
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
Lead
on
!
The
night
is
waning
fast
,
and
it
is
*NL*
precious
time
to
me
,
I
know
.
Lead
on
,
Spirit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
phantom
moved
away
as
it
had
come
towards
him
.
Scrooge
followed
in
*NL*
the
shadow
of
its
dress
,
which
bore
him
up
,
he
thought
,
and
carried
him
*NL*
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
scarcely
seemed
to
enter
the
City
;
for
the
City
rather
seemed
to
*NL*
spring
up
about
them
,
and
encompass
them
of
its
own
act
.
But
there
they
*NL*
were
in
the
heart
of
it
;
on
`
Change
,
amongst
the
merchants
;
who
hurried
*NL*
up
and
down
,
and
chinked
the
money
in
their
pockets
,
and
conversed
in
*NL*
groups
,
and
looked
at
their
watches
,
and
trifled
thoughtfully
with
their
*NL*
great
gold
seals
;
and
so
forth
,
as
Scrooge
had
seen
them
often
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
stopped
beside
one
little
knot
of
business
men
.
Observing
*NL*
that
the
hand
was
pointed
to
them
,
Scrooge
advanced
to
listen
to
their
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
a
great
fat
man
with
a
monstrous
chin
,
``
I
do
n't
know
much
*NL*
about
it
either
way
.
I
only
know
he
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
he
die
?
''
inquired
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
night
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
was
the
matter
with
him
?
''
asked
a
third
,
taking
a
vast
*NL*
quantity
of
snuff
out
of
a
very
large
snuff-box
.
``
I
thought
he
'd
never
*NL*
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
,
''
said
the
first
with
a
yawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
he
done
with
his
money
?
''
asked
a
red-faced
gentleman
with
a
*NL*
pendulous
excrescence
on
the
end
of
his
nose
,
that
shook
like
the
gills
*NL*
of
a
turkey-cock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
heard
,
''
said
the
man
with
the
large
chin
,
yawning
again
.
*NL*
``
Left
it
to
his
company
,
perhaps
.
He
has
n't
left
it
to
_
me
_
.
That
's
all
*NL*
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
pleasantry
was
received
with
a
general
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
likely
to
be
a
very
cheap
funeral
,
''
said
the
same
speaker
;
``
for
,
*NL*
upon
my
life
,
I
do
n't
know
of
anybody
to
go
to
it
.
Suppose
we
make
up
a
*NL*
party
,
and
volunteer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
going
if
a
lunch
is
provided
,
''
observed
the
gentleman
with
*NL*
the
excrescence
on
his
nose
.
``
But
I
must
be
fed
if
I
make
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
the
most
disinterested
among
you
,
after
all
,
''
said
the
first
*NL*

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Speakers
and
listeners
strolled
away
,
and
mixed
with
other
groups
.
*NL*
Scrooge
knew
the
men
,
and
looked
towards
the
Spirit
for
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Phantom
glided
on
into
a
street
.
Its
finger
pointed
to
two
persons
*NL*
meeting
.
Scrooge
listened
again
,
thinking
that
the
explanation
might
lie
*NL*
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
these
men
,
also
,
perfectly
.
They
were
men
of
business
:
very
*NL*
wealthy
,
and
of
great
importance
.
He
had
made
a
point
always
of
standing
*NL*
well
in
their
esteem
:
in
a
business
point
of
view
,
that
is
;
strictly
in
*NL*
a
business
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
?
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
?
''
returned
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
the
first
.
``
Old
Scratch
has
got
his
own
at
last
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
told
,
''
returned
the
second
.
``
Cold
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seasonable
for
Christmas-time
.
You
are
not
a
skater
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
No
.
Something
else
to
think
of
.
Good
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
another
word
.
That
was
their
meeting
,
their
conversation
,
and
their
*NL*
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
was
at
first
inclined
to
be
surprised
that
the
Spirit
should
*NL*
attach
importance
to
conversations
apparently
so
trivial
;
but
,
feeling
*NL*
assured
that
they
must
have
some
hidden
purpose
,
he
set
himself
to
*NL*
consider
what
it
was
likely
to
be
.
They
could
scarcely
be
supposed
to
*NL*
have
any
bearing
on
the
death
of
Jacob
,
his
old
partner
,
for
that
was
*NL*
Past
,
and
this
Ghost
's
province
was
the
Future
.
Nor
could
he
think
of
*NL*
any
one
immediately
connected
with
himself
,
to
whom
he
could
apply
them
.
*NL*
But
nothing
doubting
that
,
to
whomsoever
they
applied
,
they
had
some
*NL*
latent
moral
for
his
own
improvement
,
he
resolved
to
treasure
up
every
*NL*
word
he
heard
,
and
everything
he
saw
;
and
especially
to
observe
the
*NL*
shadow
of
himself
when
it
appeared
.
For
he
had
an
expectation
that
the
*NL*
conduct
of
his
future
self
would
give
him
the
clue
he
missed
,
and
would
*NL*
render
the
solution
of
these
riddles
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
about
in
that
very
place
for
his
own
image
,
but
another
man
*NL*
stood
in
his
accustomed
corner
,
and
,
though
the
clock
pointed
to
his
*NL*
usual
time
of
day
for
being
there
,
he
saw
no
likeness
of
himself
among
*NL*
the
multitudes
that
poured
in
through
the
Porch
.
It
gave
him
little
*NL*
surprise
,
however
;
for
he
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
a
change
of
*NL*
life
,
and
thought
and
hoped
he
saw
his
new-born
resolutions
carried
out
*NL*
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quiet
and
dark
,
beside
him
stood
the
Phantom
,
with
its
outstretched
*NL*
hand
.
When
he
roused
himself
from
his
thoughtful
quest
,
he
fancied
,
from
*NL*
the
turn
of
the
hand
,
and
its
situation
in
reference
to
himself
,
that
*NL*
the
Unseen
Eyes
were
looking
at
him
keenly
.
It
made
him
shudder
,
and
*NL*
feel
very
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
busy
scene
,
and
went
into
an
obscure
part
of
the
town
,
*NL*
where
Scrooge
had
never
penetrated
before
,
although
he
recognised
its
*NL*
situation
and
its
bad
repute
.
The
ways
were
foul
and
narrow
;
the
shops
*NL*
and
houses
wretched
;
the
people
half
naked
,
drunken
,
slipshod
,
ugly
.
*NL*
Alleys
and
archways
,
like
so
many
cesspools
,
disgorged
their
offences
of
*NL*
smell
,
and
dirt
,
and
life
upon
the
straggling
streets
;
and
the
whole
*NL*
quarter
reeked
with
crime
,
with
filth
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Far
in
this
den
of
infamous
resort
,
there
was
a
low-browed
,
beetling
*NL*
shop
,
below
a
pent-house
roof
,
where
iron
,
old
rags
,
bottles
,
bones
,
and
*NL*
greasy
offal
were
bought
.
Upon
the
floor
within
were
piled
up
heaps
of
*NL*
rusty
keys
,
nails
,
chains
,
hinges
,
files
,
scales
,
weights
,
and
refuse
*NL*
iron
of
all
kinds
.
Secrets
that
few
would
like
to
scrutinise
were
bred
*NL*
and
hidden
in
mountains
of
unseemly
rags
,
masses
of
corrupted
fat
,
and
*NL*
sepulchres
of
bones
.
Sitting
in
among
the
wares
he
dealt
in
,
by
a
*NL*
charcoal
stove
made
of
old
bricks
,
was
a
grey-haired
rascal
,
nearly
*NL*
seventy
years
of
age
,
who
had
screened
himself
from
the
cold
air
without
*NL*
by
a
frouzy
curtaining
of
miscellaneous
tatters
hung
upon
a
line
,
and
*NL*
smoked
his
pipe
in
all
the
luxury
of
calm
retirement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
and
the
Phantom
came
into
the
presence
of
this
man
,
just
as
a
*NL*
woman
with
a
heavy
bundle
slunk
into
the
shop
.
But
she
had
scarcely
*NL*
entered
,
when
another
woman
,
similarly
laden
,
came
in
too
,
and
she
was
*NL*
closely
followed
by
a
man
in
faded
black
,
who
was
no
less
startled
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
them
than
they
had
been
upon
the
recognition
of
each
other
.
*NL*
After
a
short
period
of
blank
astonishment
,
in
which
the
old
man
with
*NL*
the
pipe
had
joined
them
,
they
all
three
burst
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
charwoman
alone
to
be
the
first
!
''
cried
she
who
had
entered
*NL*
first
.
``
Let
the
laundress
alone
to
be
the
second
;
and
let
the
*NL*
undertaker
's
man
alone
to
be
the
third
.
Look
here
,
old
Joe
,
here
's
a
*NL*
chance
!
If
we
have
n't
all
three
met
here
without
meaning
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
have
met
in
a
better
place
,
''
said
old
Joe
,
removing
his
*NL*
pipe
from
his
mouth
.
``
Come
into
the
parlour
.
You
were
made
free
of
it
*NL*
long
ago
,
you
know
;
and
the
other
two
a
n't
strangers
.
Stop
till
I
shut
*NL*
the
door
of
the
shop
.
Ah
!
How
it
skreeks
!
There
a
n't
such
a
rusty
bit
of
*NL*
metal
in
the
place
as
its
own
hinges
,
I
believe
;
and
I
'm
sure
there
's
no
*NL*
such
old
bones
here
as
mine
.
Ha
!
ha
!
We
're
all
suitable
to
our
calling
,
*NL*
we
're
well
matched
.
Come
into
the
parlour
.
Come
into
the
parlour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlour
was
the
space
behind
the
screen
of
rags
.
The
old
man
raked
*NL*
the
fire
together
with
an
old
stair-rod
,
and
,
having
trimmed
his
smoky
*NL*
lamp
-LRB-
for
it
was
night
-RRB-
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
,
put
it
into
his
mouth
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
did
this
,
the
woman
who
had
already
spoken
threw
her
bundle
on
*NL*
the
floor
,
and
sat
down
in
a
flaunting
manner
on
a
stool
;
crossing
her
*NL*
elbows
on
her
knees
,
and
looking
with
a
bold
defiance
at
the
other
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
odds
,
then
?
What
odds
,
Mrs.
Dilber
?
''
said
the
woman
.
``
Every
person
*NL*
has
a
right
to
take
care
of
themselves
.
_
He
_
always
did
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
indeed
!
''
said
the
laundress
.
``
No
man
more
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
do
n't
stand
staring
as
if
you
was
afraid

woman
!
Who
's
the
*NL*
wiser
?
We
're
not
going
to
pick
holes
in
each
other
's
coats
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
!
''
said
Mrs.
Dilber
and
the
man
together
.
``
We
should
hope
*NL*
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
!
''
cried
the
woman
.
``
That
's
enough
.
Who
's
the
worse
for
*NL*
the
loss
of
a
few
things
like
these

Not
a
dead
man
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dilber
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
wanted
to
keep
'em
after
he
was
dead

a
wicked
old
screw

*NL*
pursued
the
woman
,
``
why
was
n't
he
natural
in
his
lifetime

If
he
had
*NL*
been
,
he
'd
have
had
somebody
to
look
after
him
when
he
was
struck
with
*NL*
Death
,
instead
of
lying
gasping
out
his
last
there
,
alone
by
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
truest
word
that
ever
was
spoke
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dilber
,
``
It
's
a
*NL*
judgment
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
was
a
little
heavier
judgment
,
''
replied
the
woman
;
``
and
it
*NL*
should
have
been

you
may
depend
upon
it

if
I
could
have
laid
my

on
anything
else

Open
that
bundle

old
Joe
,

let
me
know
the
value
*NL*
of
it

Speak
out
plain
.
I
'm
not
afraid
to
be
the
first
,
nor
afraid
for
*NL*
them
to
see
it

We
knew
pretty
well
that
we
were
helping
ourselves
*NL*
before
we
met
here
,
I
believe
.
It
's
no
sin

Open
the
bundle

Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
gallantry
of
her
friends
would
not
allow
of
this
;
and
the
man
in
*NL*
faded
black
,
mounting
the
breach
first
,
produced
_
his
_
plunder
.
It
was
*NL*
not
extensive
.
A
seal
or
two
,
a
pencil-case
,
a
pair
of
sleeve-buttons
,
*NL*
and
a
brooch
of
no
great
value
,
were
all
.
They
were
severally
examined
*NL*
and
appraised
by
old
Joe
,
who
chalked
the
sums
he
was
disposed
to
give
*NL*
for
each
upon
the
wall
,
and
added
them
up
into
a
total
when
he
found
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
your
account

said
Joe
,
``
and
I
would
n't
give
another
sixpence

boiled
for

Who
's
next

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dilber
was
next
.
Sheets
and
towels
,
a
little
wearing
apparel
,
two
*NL*
old-fashioned
silver
tea-spoons
,
a
pair
of
sugar-tongs
,
and
a
few
boots
.
*NL*
Her
account
was
stated
on
the
wall
in
the
same
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
give
too
much
to

It

a
weakness

mine

the
way
I
ruin
myself

said
old
Joe
.
``
That
's
your
account

If

it

I

repent

off
half-a-crown

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
undo
_
my

said
the
first
woman

*NL*
*NL*
Joe
went
down
on
his
knees
for
the
greater
convenience
of
opening
it
,
*NL*
and
,
having
unfastened
a
great
many
knots
,
dragged
out
a
large
heavy
*NL*
roll
of
some
dark
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
this

said
Joe

``
Bed-curtains

Ah

the

laughing

crossed

the

coolly

*NL*
``

stopping

in

looking
up

a

good

uglier
than

did

one

*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
listened
to
this
dialogue
in
horror

As
they
sat
grouped
about
*NL*
their
spoil
,
in
the
scanty
light
afforded
by
the
old
man
's
lamp
,
he
*NL*
viewed
them
with
a
detestation
and
disgust
which
could
hardly
have
been
*NL*
greater
,
though
they
had
been
obscene
demons
,
marketing
the
corpse
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
''
laughed
the
same
woman
when
old
Joe
,
producing
a
flannel
bag
*NL*
with
money
in
it
,
told
out
their
several
gains
upon
the
ground
.
``
This
is
*NL*
the
end
of
it
,
you
see
!
He
frightened
every
one
away
from
him
when
he
*NL*
was
alive
,
to
profit
us
when
he
was
dead
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
''
said
Scrooge
,
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
.
``
I
see
,
I
see
.
The
*NL*
case
of
this
unhappy
man
might
be
my
own
.
My
life
tends
that
way
now
.
*NL*
Merciful
Heaven
,
what
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
recoiled
in
terror
,
for
the
scene
had
changed
,
and
now
he
almost
*NL*
touched
a
bed
:
a
bare
,
uncurtained
bed
:
on
which
,
beneath
a
ragged
*NL*
sheet
,
there
lay
a
something
covered
up
,
which
,
though
it
was
dumb
,
*NL*
announced
itself
in
awful
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
very
dark
,
too
dark
to
be
observed
with
any
accuracy
,
*NL*
though
Scrooge
glanced
round
it
in
obedience
to
a
secret
impulse
,
*NL*
anxious
to
know
what
kind
of
room
it
was
.
A
pale
light
,
rising
in
the
*NL*
outer
air
,
fell
straight
upon
the
bed
:
and
on
it
,
plundered
and
bereft
,
*NL*
unwatched
,
unwept
,
uncared
for
,
was
the
body
of
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
glanced
towards
the
Phantom
.
Its
steady
hand
was
pointed
to
the
*NL*
head
.
The
cover
was
so
carelessly
adjusted
that
the
slightest
raising
of
*NL*
it
,
the
motion
of
a
finger
upon
Scrooge
's
part
,
would
have
disclosed
the
*NL*
face
.
He
thought
of
it
,
felt
how
easy
it
would
be
to
do
,
and
longed
to
*NL*
do
it
;
but
had
no
more
power
to
withdraw
the
veil
than
to
dismiss
the
*NL*
spectre
at
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
cold
,
cold
,
rigid
,
dreadful
Death
,
set
up
thine
altar
here
,
and
*NL*
dress
it
with
such
terrors
as
thou
hast
at
thy
command
:
for
this
is
thy
*NL*
dominion
!
But
of
the
loved
,
revered
,
and
honoured
head
thou
canst
not
*NL*
turn
one
hair
to
thy
dread
purposes
,
or
make
one
feature
odious
.
It
is
*NL*
not
that
the
hand
is
heavy
,
and
will
fall
down
when
released
;
it
is
not
*NL*
that
the
heart
and
pulse
are
still
;
but
that
the
hand
WAS
open
,
*NL*
generous
,
and
true
;
the
heart
brave
,
warm
,
and
tender
;
and
the
pulse
a
*NL*
man
's
.
Strike
,
Shadow
,
strike
!
And
see
his
good
deeds
springing
from
the
*NL*
wound
,
to
sow
the
world
with
life
immortal
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
voice
pronounced
these
words
in
Scrooge
's
ears
,
and
yet
he
heard
them
*NL*
when
he
looked
upon
the
bed
.
He
thought
,
if
this
man
could
be
raised
up
*NL*
now
,
what
would
be
his
foremost
thoughts
?
Avarice
,
hard
dealing
,
griping
*NL*
cares
?
They
have
brought
him
to
a
rich
end
,
truly
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
,
in
the
dark
,
empty
house
,
with
not
a
man
,
a
woman
,
or
a
child
to
*NL*
say
he
was
kind
to
me
in
this
or
that
,
and
for
the
memory
of
one
kind
*NL*
word
I
will
be
kind
to
him
.
A
cat
was
tearing
at
the
door
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
sound
of
gnawing
rats
beneath
the
hearth-stone
.
What
_
they
_
wanted
in
*NL*
the
room
of
death
,
and
why
they
were
so
restless
and
disturbed
,
Scrooge
*NL*
did
not
dare
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
''
he
said
,
``
this
is
a
fearful
place
.
In
leaving
it
,
I
shall
not
*NL*
leave
its
lesson
,
trust
me
.
Let
us
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
Ghost
pointed
with
an
unmoved
finger
to
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
,
''
Scrooge
returned
,
``
and
I
would
do
it
if
I
could
.
But
*NL*
I
have
not
the
power
,
Spirit
.
I
have
not
the
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
it
seemed
to
look
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
any
person
in
the
town
who
feels
emotion
caused
by
this
*NL*
man
's
death
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
quite
agonised
,
``
show
that
person
to
me
,
*NL*
Spirit
!
I
beseech
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Phantom
spread
its
dark
robe
before
him
for
a
moment
,
like
a
wing
;
*NL*
and
,
withdrawing
it
,
revealed
a
room
by
daylight
,
where
a
mother
and
her
*NL*
children
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
expecting
some
one
,
and
with
anxious
eagerness
;
for
she
walked
*NL*
up
and
down
the
room
;
started
at
every
sound
;
looked
out
from
the
*NL*
window
;
glanced
at
the
clock
;
tried
,
but
in
vain
,
to
work
with
her
*NL*
needle
;
and
could
hardly
bear
the
voices
of
her
children
in
their
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
long-expected
knock
was
heard
.
She
hurried
to
the
door
,
*NL*
and
met
her
husband
;
a
man
whose
face
was
careworn
and
depressed
,
though
*NL*
he
was
young
.
There
was
a
remarkable
expression
in
it
now
;
a
kind
of
*NL*
serious
delight
of
which
he
felt
ashamed
,
and
which
he
struggled
to
*NL*
repress
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
to
the
dinner
that
had
been
hoarding
for
him
by
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
,
when
she
asked
him
faintly
what
news
-LRB-
which
was
not
until
after
a
*NL*
long
silence
-RRB-
,
he
appeared
embarrassed
how
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
good
,
''
she
said
,
``
or
bad
?
''
to
help
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
quite
ruined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
There
is
hope
yet
,
Caroline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
_
he
_
relents
,
''
she
said
,
amazed
,
``
there
is
!
Nothing
is
past
hope
,
if
*NL*
such
a
miracle
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
past
relenting
,
''
said
her
husband
.
``
He
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
mild
and
patient
creature
,
if
her
face
spoke
truth
;
but
she
*NL*
was
thankful
in
her
soul
to
hear
it
,
and
she
said
so
with
clasped
hands
.
*NL*
She
prayed
forgiveness
the
next
moment
,
and
was
sorry
;
but
the
first
was
*NL*
the
emotion
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
half-drunken
woman
,
whom
I
told
you
of
last
night
,
said
to
me
*NL*
when
I
tried
to
see
him
and
obtain
a
week
's
delay
,
and
what
I
thought
*NL*
was
a
mere
excuse
to
avoid
me
,
turns
out
to
have
been
quite
true
.
He
was
*NL*
not
only
very
ill
,
but
dying
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
will
our
debt
be
transferred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
But
,
before
that
time
,
we
shall
be
ready
with
the
money
;
*NL*
and
,
even
though
we
were
not
,
it
would
be
bad
fortune
indeed
to
find
so
*NL*
merciless
a
creditor
in
his
successor
.
We
may
sleep
to-night
with
light
*NL*
hearts
,
Caroline
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
Soften
it
as
they
would
,
their
hearts
were
lighter
.
The
children
's
*NL*
faces
,
hushed
and
clustered
round
to
hear
what
they
so
little
*NL*
understood
,
were
brighter
;
and
it
was
a
happier
house
for
this
man
's
*NL*
death
!
The
only
emotion
that
the
Ghost
could
show
him
,
caused
by
the
*NL*
event
,
was
one
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
some
tenderness
connected
with
a
death
,
''
said
Scrooge
;
``
or
*NL*
that
dark
chamber
,
Spirit
,
which
we
left
just
now
,
will
be
for
ever
*NL*
present
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
conducted
him
through
several
streets
familiar
to
his
feet
;
*NL*
and
,
as
they
went
along
,
Scrooge
looked
here
and
there
to
find
himself
,
*NL*
but
nowhere
was
he
to
be
seen
.
They
entered
poor
Bob
Cratchit
's
*NL*
house
,
--
the
dwelling
he
had
visited
before
,
--
and
found
the
mother
and
*NL*
the
children
seated
round
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quiet
.
Very
quiet
.
The
noisy
little
Cratchits
were
as
still
as
statues
*NL*
in
one
corner
,
and
sat
looking
up
at
Peter
,
who
had
a
book
before
him
.
*NL*
The
mother
and
her
daughters
were
engaged
in
sewing
.
But
surely
they
*NL*
were
very
quiet
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
he
took
a
child
,
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Where
had
Scrooge
heard
those
words
?
He
had
not
dreamed
them
.
The
boy
*NL*
must
have
read
them
out
,
as
he
and
the
Spirit
crossed
the
threshold
.
Why
*NL*
did
he
not
go
on
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
laid
her
work
upon
the
table
,
and
put
her
hand
up
to
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
colour
hurts
my
eyes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
?
Ah
,
poor
Tiny
Tim
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
better
now
again
,
''
said
Cratchit
's
wife
.
``
It
makes
them
weak
by
*NL*
candle-light
;
and
I
would
n't
show
weak
eyes
to
your
father
,
when
he
*NL*
comes
home
,
for
the
world
.
It
must
be
near
his
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Past
it
rather
,
''
Peter
answered
,
shutting
up
his
book
.
``
But
I
think
he
*NL*
has
walked
a
little
slower
than
he
used
,
these
few
last
evenings
,
*NL*
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
very
quiet
again
.
At
last
she
said
,
and
in
a
steady
,
cheerful
*NL*
voice
,
that
only
faltered
once
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
known
him
walk
with
--
I
have
known
him
walk
with
Tiny
Tim
upon
*NL*
his
shoulder
very
fast
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
have
I
,
''
cried
Peter
.
``
Often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
have
I
,
''
exclaimed
another
.
So
had
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
was
very
light
to
carry
,
''
she
resumed
,
intent
upon
her
work
,
*NL*
``
and
his
father
loved
him
so
,
that
it
was
no
trouble
:
no
trouble
.
And
*NL*
there
is
your
father
at
the
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurried
out
to
meet
him
;
and
little
Bob
in
his
comforter
--
he
had
*NL*
need
of
it
,
poor
fellow
--
came
in
.
His
tea
was
ready
for
him
on
the
hob
,
*NL*
and
they
all
tried
who
should
help
him
to
it
most
.
Then
the
two
young
*NL*
Cratchits
got
upon
his
knees
,
and
laid
,
each
child
,
a
little
cheek
*NL*
against
his
face
,
as
if
they
said
,
``
Do
n't
mind
it
,
father
.
Do
n't
be
*NL*
grieved
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
was
very
cheerful
with
them
,
and
spoke
pleasantly
to
all
the
family
.
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
work
upon
the
table
,
and
praised
the
industry
and
speed
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Cratchit
and
the
girls
.
They
would
be
done
long
before
Sunday
,
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sunday
!
You
went
to-day
,
then
,
Robert
?
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
''
returned
Bob
.
``
I
wish
you
could
have
gone
.
It
would
have
*NL*
done
you
good
to
see
how
green
a
place
it
is
.
But
you
'll
see
it
often
.
I
*NL*
promised
him
that
I
would
walk
there
on
a
Sunday
.
My
little
,
little
*NL*
child
!
''
cried
Bob
.
``
My
little
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
down
all
at
once
.
He
could
n't
help
it
.
If
he
could
have
helped
*NL*
it
,
he
and
his
child
would
have
been
farther
apart
,
perhaps
,
than
they
*NL*
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
room
,
and
went
up-stairs
into
the
room
above
,
which
was
*NL*
lighted
cheerfully
,
and
hung
with
Christmas
.
There
was
a
chair
set
close
*NL*
beside
the
child
,
and
there
were
signs
of
some
one
having
been
there
*NL*
lately
.
Poor
Bob
sat
down
in
it
,
and
,
when
he
had
thought
a
little
and
*NL*
composed
himself
,
he
kissed
the
little
face
.
He
was
reconciled
to
what
*NL*
had
happened
,
and
went
down
again
quite
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
about
the
fire
,
and
talked
;
the
girls
and
mother
working
*NL*
still
.
Bob
told
them
of
the
extraordinary
kindness
of
Mr.
Scrooge
's
*NL*
nephew
,
whom
he
had
scarcely
seen
but
once
,
and
who
,
meeting
him
in
the
*NL*
street
that
day
,
and
seeing
that
he
looked
a
little
--
``
just
a
little
*NL*
down
,
you
know
,
''
said
Bob
,
inquired
what
had
happened
to
distress
him
.
*NL*
``
On
which
,
''
said
Bob
,
``
for
he
is
the
pleasantest-spoken
gentleman
you
*NL*
ever
heard
,
I
told
him
.
'
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
it
,
Mr.
Cratchit
,
'
he
*NL*
said
,
`
and
heartily
sorry
for
your
good
wife
.
'
By-the-bye
,
how
he
ever
*NL*
knew
_
that
_
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knew
what
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
you
were
a
good
wife
,
''
replied
Bob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
knows
that
,
''
said
Peter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
observed
,
my
boy
!
''
cried
Bob
.
``
I
hope
they
do
.
`
Heartily
*NL*
sorry
,
'
he
said
,
`
for
your
good
wife
.
If
I
can
be
of
service
to

Bob

much

this
was
quite

It

*NL*
with

*NL*
*NL*
``

Bob

*NL*

Only

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*

And
then

cried
one
of
the

``
Peter
will
be
keeping
company

setting
up

*NL*
``
Get
along

Peter

grinning

*NL*

It

just

Bob

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

they
all
cried
again

*NL*
*NL*

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

kissed

his

kissed

the
two
young

Cratchits
kissed
him

Peter

thy

essence

*NL*
*NL*
``
Spectre

''
said
Scrooge
,
``
something
informs
me
that
our
parting
moment

is
at
hand

I

it

I

Tell

what

*NL*
whom

saw
lying
dead

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ghost
of
Christmas
Yet
To
Come
conveyed
him
,
as
before
--
though
at
a
*NL*
different
time
,
he
thought
:
indeed
,
there
seemed
no
order
in
these
*NL*
latter
visions
,
save
that
they
were
in
the
Future
--
into
the
resorts
of
*NL*
business
men
,
but
showed
him
not
himself
.
Indeed
,
the
Spirit
did
not
*NL*
stay
for
anything
,
but
went
straight
on
,
as
to
the
end
just
now
desired
,
*NL*
until
besought
by
Scrooge
to
tarry
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
court
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
``
through
which
we
hurry
now
,
is
where
my
*NL*
place
of
occupation
is
,
and
has
been
for
a
length
of
time
.
I
see
the
*NL*
house
.
Let
me
behold
what
I
shall
be
in
days
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
stopped
;
the
hand
was
pointed
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
is
yonder
,
''
Scrooge
exclaimed
.
``
Why
do
you
point
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
inexorable
finger
underwent
no
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
hastened
to
the
window
of
his
office
,
and
looked
in
.
It
was
an
*NL*
office
still
,
but
not
his
.
The
furniture
was
not
the
same
,
and
the
*NL*
figure
in
the
chair
was
not
himself
.
The
Phantom
pointed
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
joined
it
once
again
,
and
,
wondering
why
and
whither
he
had
gone
,
*NL*
accompanied
it
until
they
reached
an
iron
gate
.
He
paused
to
look
round
*NL*
before
entering
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
churchyard
.
Here
,
then
,
the
wretched
man
,
whose
name
he
had
now
to
*NL*
learn
,
lay
underneath
the
ground
.
It
was
a
worthy
place
.
Walled
in
by
*NL*
houses
;
overrun
by
grass
and
weeds
,
the
growth
of
vegetation
's
death
,
*NL*
not
life
;
choked
up
with
too
much
burying
;
fat
with
repleted
appetite
.
A
*NL*
worthy
place
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
stood
among
the
graves
,
and
pointed
down
to
One
.
He
advanced
*NL*
towards
it
trembling
.
The
Phantom
was
exactly
as
it
had
been
,
but
he
*NL*
dreaded
that
he
saw
new
meaning
in
its
solemn
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
draw
nearer
to
that
stone
to
which
you
point
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
*NL*
``
answer
me
one
question
.
Are
these
the
shadows
of
the
things
that
Will
*NL*
be
,
or
are
they
shadows
of
the
things
that
May
be
only
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
Ghost
pointed
downward
to
the
grave
by
which
it
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
's
courses
will
foreshadow
certain
ends
,
to
which
,
if
persevered
in
,
*NL*
they
must
lead
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
But
if
the
courses
be
departed
from
,
the
*NL*
ends
will
change
.
Say
it
is
thus
with
what
you
show
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spirit
was
immovable
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
crept
towards
it
,
trembling
as
he
went
;
and
,
following
the
*NL*
finger
,
read
upon
the
stone
of
the
neglected
grave
his
own
name
,
*NL*
EBENEZER
SCROOGE
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
_
I
_
that
man
who
lay
upon
the
bed
?
''
he
cried
upon
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
finger
pointed
from
the
grave
to
him
,
and
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Spirit
!
Oh
no
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
finger
still
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirit
!
''
he
cried
,
tight
clutching
at
its
robe
,
``
hear
me
!
I
am
not
the
*NL*
man
I
was
.
I
will
not
be
the
man
I
must
have
been
but
for
this
*NL*
intercourse
.
Why
show
me
this
,
if
I
am
past
all
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
the
hand
appeared
to
shake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Spirit
,
''
he
pursued
,
as
down
upon
the
ground
he
fell
before
it
:
*NL*
``
your
nature
intercedes
for
me
,
and
pities
me
.
Assure
me
that
I
yet
may
*NL*
change
these
shadows
you
have
shown
me
by
an
altered
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
kind
hand
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
honour
Christmas
in
my
heart
,
and
try
to
keep
it
all
the
year

will
live
in
the
Past
,
the
Present
,
and
the
Future

The
Spirits
of
all
*NL*
Three
shall
strive
within
me
.
I
will
not
shut
out
the
lessons
that
they
*NL*
teach
.
Oh
,
tell
me
I
may
sponge
away
the
writing
on
this
stone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
agony
,
he
caught
the
spectral
hand
.
It
sought
to
free
itself
,
but
*NL*
he
was
strong
in
his
entreaty
,
and
detained
it
.
The
Spirit
,
stronger
*NL*
yet
,
repulsed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Holding
up
his
hands
in
a
last
prayer
to
have
his
fate
reversed
,
he
saw
*NL*
an
alteration
in
the
Phantom
's
hood
and
dress
.
It
shrunk
,
collapsed
,
and
*NL*
dwindled
down
into
a
bedpost
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
STAVE
FIVE
*NL*
*NL*
THE
END
OF
IT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
!
and
the
bedpost
was
his
own
.
The
bed
was
his
own
,
the
room
was
his
*NL*
own
.
Best
and
happiest
of
all
,
the
Time
before
him
was
his
own
,
to
make
*NL*
amends
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
live
in
the
Past
,
the
Present
,
and
the
Future
!
''
Scrooge
repeated
*NL*
as
he
scrambled
out
of
bed
.
``
The
Spirits
of
all
Three
shall
strive
*NL*
within
me

Oh

Jacob
Marley

Heaven
and

for
this

I
say
it
on

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
fluttered
and
so
glowing
with
his
good
intentions
,
that
his
*NL*
broken
voice
would
scarcely
answer
to
his
call
.
He
had
been
sobbing
*NL*
violently
in
his
conflict
with
the
Spirit
,
and
his
face
was
wet
with
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
torn
down
,

cried
Scrooge
,
folding
one
of
his
bed-curtains
*NL*
in
his
arms
,
``
they
are
not
torn
down

all

*NL*
*NL*
His
hands
were
busy
with
his
garments
all
this
time
;
turning
them
inside
*NL*
out
,
putting
them
on
upside
down
,
tearing
them
,
mislaying
them
,
making
*NL*
them
parties
to
every
kind
of
extravagance

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

know
what
to

cried
Scrooge
,
laughing
and
crying
in
the
*NL*
same
breath
;
and
making
a
perfect
Laocooen
of
himself
with
his
stockings

He
had
frisked
into
the
sitting-room

was
now
standing
there
:

perfectly
winded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

off
again

had
been
out

for
so
many
years

it
was

a
splendid

was

ringing

downward

loitered
in

look

send
it
to
Bob
Cratchit
's
,
''
whispered
Scrooge
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
*NL*
and
splitting
with
a
laugh
.
``
He
sha
n't
know
who
sends
it
.
It
's
twice
the
*NL*
size
of
Tiny
Tim
.
Joe
Miller
never
made
such
a
joke
as
sending
it
to
*NL*
Bob
's
will
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
in
which
he
wrote
the
address
was
not
a
steady
one
;
but
write
*NL*
it
he
did
,
somehow
,
and
went
down-stairs
to
open
the
street-door
,
ready
*NL*
for
the
coming
of
the
poulterer
's
man
.
As
he
stood
there
,
waiting
his
*NL*
arrival
,
the
knocker
caught
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
love
it
as
long
as
I
live
!
''
cried
Scrooge
,
patting
it
with
his
*NL*
hand
.
``
I
scarcely
ever
looked
at
it
before
.
What
an
honest
expression
it
*NL*
has
in
its
face
!
It
's
a
wonderful
knocker
!
--
Here
's
the
Turkey
.
Hallo
!
*NL*
Whoop
!
How
are
you
?
Merry
Christmas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
_
was
_
a
Turkey
!
He
never
could
have
stood
upon
his
legs
,
that
bird
.
*NL*
He
would
have
snapped
'em
short
off
in
a
minute
,
like
sticks
of
*NL*
sealing-wax
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
impossible
to
carry
that
to
Camden
Town
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
You
*NL*
must
have
a
cab
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chuckle
with
which
he
said
this
,
and
the
chuckle
with
which
he
paid
*NL*
for
the
Turkey
,
and
the
chuckle
with
which
he
paid
for
the
cab
,
and
the
*NL*
chuckle
with
which
he
recompensed
the
boy
,
were
only
to
be
exceeded
by
*NL*
the
chuckle
with
which
he
sat
down
breathless
in
his
chair
again
,
and
*NL*
chuckled
till
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shaving
was
not
an
easy
task
,
for
his
hand
continued
to
shake
very
much
;
*NL*
and
shaving
requires
attention
,
even
when
you
do
n't
dance
while
you
are
*NL*
at
it
.
But
,
if
he
had
cut
the
end
of
his
nose
off
,
he
would
have
put
a
*NL*
piece
of
sticking-plaster
over
it
,
and
been
quite
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dressed
himself
``
all
in
his
best
,
''
and
at
last
got
out
into
the
*NL*
streets
.
The
people
were
by
this
time
pouring
forth
,
as
he
had
seen
them
*NL*
with
the
Ghost
of
Christmas
Present
;
and
,
walking
with
his
hands
behind
*NL*
him
,
Scrooge
regarded
every
one
with
a
delighted
smile
.
He
looked
so
*NL*
irresistibly
pleasant
,
in
a
word
,
that
three
or
four
good-humoured
*NL*
fellows
said
,
``
Good
morning
,
sir
!
A
merry
Christmas
to
you
!
''
And
Scrooge
*NL*
said
often
afterwards
that
,
of
all
the
blithe
sounds
he
had
ever
heard
,
*NL*
those
were
the
blithest
in
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
gone
far
when
,
coming
on
towards
him
,
he
beheld
the
portly
*NL*
gentleman
who
had
walked
into
his
counting-house
the
day
before
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Scrooge
and
Marley
's
,
I
believe
?
''
It
sent
a
pang
across
his
heart
*NL*
to
think
how
this
old
gentleman
would
look
upon
him
when
they
met
;
but
*NL*
he
knew
what
path
lay
straight
before
him
,
and
he
took
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
quickening
his
pace
,
and
taking
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
by
both
his
hands
,
``
how
do
you
do
?
I
hope
you
succeeded
*NL*
yesterday
.
It
was
very
kind
of
you
.
A
merry
Christmas
to
you
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Scrooge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
That
is
my
name
,
and
I
fear
it
may
not
be
pleasant
*NL*
to
you
.
Allow
me
to
ask
your
pardon
.
And
will
you
have
the
goodness
--
''
*NL*
Here
Scrooge
whispered
in
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
me
!
''
cried
the
gentleman
,
as
if
his
breath
were
taken
away
.
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mr.
Scrooge
,
are
you
serious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
Not
a
farthing
less
.
A
great
many
*NL*
back-payments
are
included
in
it
,
I
assure
you
.
Will
you
do
me
that
*NL*
favour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
said
the
other
,
shaking
hands
with
him
,
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
say
to
such
munifi
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
anything
,
please
,
''
retorted
Scrooge
.
``
Come
and
see
me
.
Will
*NL*
you
come
and
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
!
''
cried
the
old
gentleman
.
And
it
was
clear
he
meant
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
.
I
thank
you
fifty
*NL*
times
.
Bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
church
,
and
walked
about
the
streets
,
and
watched
the
people
*NL*
hurrying
to
and
fro
,
and
patted
the
children
on
the
head
,
and
questioned
*NL*
beggars
,
and
looked
down
into
the
kitchens
of
houses
,
and
up
to
the
*NL*
windows
;
and
found
that
everything
could
yield
him
pleasure
.
He
had
*NL*
never
dreamed
that
any
walk
--
that
anything
--
could
give
him
so
much
*NL*
happiness
.
In
the
afternoon
he
turned
his
steps
towards
his
nephew
's
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
the
door
a
dozen
times
before
he
had
the
courage
to
go
up
and
*NL*
knock
.
But
he
made
a
dash
,
and
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
master
at
home
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Scrooge
to
the
girl
.
Nice
girl
!
*NL*
Very
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
,
my
love
?
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
in
the
dining-room
,
sir
,
along
with
mistress
.
I
'll
show
you
*NL*
up-stairs
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
.
He
knows
me
,
''
said
Scrooge
,
with
his
hand
already
on
the
*NL*
dining-room
lock
.
``
I
'll
go
in
here
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
it
gently
,
and
sidled
his
face
in
round
the
door
.
They
were
*NL*
looking
at
the
table
-LRB-
which
was
spread
out
in
great
array
-RRB-
;
for
these
*NL*
young
housekeepers
are
always
nervous
on
such
points
,
and
like
to
see
*NL*
that
everything
is
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
!
''
said
Scrooge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
heart
alive
,
how
his
niece
by
marriage
started
!
Scrooge
had
*NL*
forgotten
,
for
the
moment
,
about
her
sitting
in
the
corner
with
the
*NL*
footstool
,
or
he
would
n't
have
done
it
on
any
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
my
soul
!
''
cried
Fred
,
``
who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
I.
Your
uncle
Scrooge
.
I
have
come
to
dinner
.
Will
you
let
me
in
,
*NL*
Fred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
him
in
!
It
is
a
mercy
he
did
n't
shake
his
arm
off
.
He
was
at
home
in
*NL*
five
minutes
.
Nothing
could
be
heartier
.
His
niece
looked
just
the
same
.
*NL*
So
did
Topper
when
_
he
_
came
.
So
did
the
plump
sister
when
_
she
_
came
.
*NL*
So
did
every
one
when
_
they
_
came
.
Wonderful
party
,
wonderful
games
,
*NL*
wonderful
unanimity
,
won-der-ful
happiness
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
early
at
the
office
next
morning
.
Oh
,
he
was
early
there
!
If
*NL*
he
could
only
be
there
first
,
and
catch
Bob
Cratchit
coming
late
!
That
*NL*
was
the
thing
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
it
;
yes
,
he
did
!
The
clock
struck
nine
.
No
Bob
.
A
quarter
*NL*
past
.
No
Bob
.
He
was
full
eighteen
minutes
and
a
half
behind
his
time
.
*NL*
Scrooge
sat
with
his
door
wide
open
,
that
he
might
see
him
come
into
the
*NL*
tank
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hat
was
off
before
he
opened
the
door
;
his
comforter
too
.
He
was
on
*NL*
his
stool
in
a
jiffy
;
driving
away
with
his
pen
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
*NL*
overtake
nine
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
''
growled
Scrooge
in
his
accustomed
voice
as
near
as
he
could
*NL*
feign
it
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
at
this
time
of
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
sir
,
''
said
Bob
.
``
I
_
am
_
behind
my
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
!
''
repeated
Scrooge
.
``
Yes
.
I
think
you
are
.
Step
this
way
,
sir
,
*NL*
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
once
a
year
,
sir
,
''
pleaded
Bob
,
appearing
from
the
tank
.
``
It
*NL*
shall
not
be
repeated
.
I
was
making
rather
merry
yesterday
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Scrooge
.
``
I
am
not
going
to
*NL*
stand
this
sort
of
thing
any
longer
.
And
therefore
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
leaping
from
his
stool
,
and
giving
Bob
such
a
dig
in
the
waistcoat
that
*NL*
he
staggered
back
into
the
tank
again
:
``
and
therefore
I
am
about
to
*NL*
raise
your
salary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
trembled
,
and
got
a
little
nearer
to
the
ruler
.
He
had
a
momentary
*NL*
idea
of
knocking
Scrooge
down
with
it
,
holding
him
,
and
calling
to
the
*NL*
people
in
the
court
for
help
and
a
strait-waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
merry
Christmas
,
Bob
!
''
said
Scrooge
with
an
earnestness
that
could
*NL*
not
be
mistaken
,
as
he
clapped
him
on
the
back
.
``
A
merrier
Christmas
,
*NL*
Bob
,
my
good
fellow
,
than
I
have
given
you
for
many
a
year
!
I
'll
raise
*NL*
your
salary
,
and
endeavour
to
assist
your
struggling
family
,
and
we
will
*NL*
discuss
your
affairs
this
very
afternoon
,
over
a
Christmas
bowl
of
*NL*
smoking
bishop
,
Bob
!
Make
up
the
fires
and
buy
another
coal-scuttle
*NL*
before
you
dot
another
i
,
Bob
Cratchit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Scrooge
was
better
than
his
word
.
He
did
it
all
,
and
infinitely
more
;
*NL*
and
to
Tiny
Tim
,
who
did
NOT
die
,
he
was
a
second
father
.
He
became
as
*NL*
good
a
friend
,
as
good
a
master
,
and
as
good
a
man
as
the
good
old
City
*NL*
knew
,
or
any
other
good
old
city
,
town
,
or
borough
in
the
good
old
*NL*
world
.
Some
people
laughed
to
see
the
alteration
in
him
,
but
he
let
them
*NL*
laugh
,
and
little
heeded
them
;
for
he
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
*NL*
nothing
ever
happened
on
this
globe
,
for
good
,
at
which
some
people
did
*NL*
not
have
their
fill
of
laughter
in
the
outset
;
and
,
knowing
that
such
as
*NL*
these
would
be
blind
anyway
,
he
thought
it
quite
as
well
that
they
*NL*
should
wrinkle
up
their
eyes
in
grins
as
have
the
malady
in
less
*NL*
attractive
forms
.
His
own
heart
laughed
:
and
that
was
quite
enough
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
further
intercourse
with
Spirits
,
but
lived
upon
the
*NL*
Total-Abstinence
Principle
ever
afterwards
;
and
it
was
always
said
of
*NL*
him
that
he
knew
how
to
keep
Christmas
well
,
if
any
man
alive
possessed
*NL*
the
knowledge
.
May
that
be
truly
said
of
us
,
and
all
of
us
!
And
so
,
as
*NL*
Tiny
Tim
observed
,
God
bless
Us
,
Every
One
!
