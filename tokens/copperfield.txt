PREFACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
find
it
easy
to
get
sufficiently
far
away
from
this
Book
,
in
*NL*
the
first
sensations
of
having
finished
it
,
to
refer
to
it
with
the
*NL*
composure
which
this
formal
heading
would
seem
to
require
.
My
interest
*NL*
in
it
,
is
so
recent
and
strong
;
and
my
mind
is
so
divided
between
*NL*
pleasure
and
regret
--
pleasure
in
the
achievement
of
a
long
design
,
*NL*
regret
in
the
separation
from
many
companions
--
that
I
am
in
danger
of
*NL*
wearying
the
reader
whom
I
love
,
with
personal
confidences
,
and
private
*NL*
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
which
,
all
that
I
could
say
of
the
Story
,
to
any
purpose
,
I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
say
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
concern
the
reader
little
,
perhaps
,
to
know
,
how
sorrowfully
*NL*
the
pen
is
laid
down
at
the
close
of
a
two-years
'
imaginative
task
;
or
*NL*
how
an
Author
feels
as
if
he
were
dismissing
some
portion
of
himself
*NL*
into
the
shadowy
world
,
when
a
crowd
of
the
creatures
of
his
brain
are
*NL*
going
from
him
for
ever
.
Yet
,
I
have
nothing
else
to
tell
;
unless
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
were
to
confess
-LRB-
which
might
be
of
less
moment
still
-RRB-
that
no
*NL*
one
can
ever
believe
this
Narrative
,
in
the
reading
,
more
than
I
have
*NL*
believed
it
in
the
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
looking
back
,
therefore
,
I
will
look
forward
.
I
can
not
close
*NL*
this
Volume
more
agreeably
to
myself
,
than
with
a
hopeful
glance
towards
*NL*
the
time
when
I
shall
again
put
forth
my
two
green
leaves
once
a
month
,
*NL*
and
with
a
faithful
remembrance
of
the
genial
sun
and
showers
that
have
*NL*
fallen
on
these
leaves
of
David
Copperfield
,
and
made
me
happy
.

DAVID
COPPERFIELD
THE
YOUNGER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
I
AM
BORN
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
I
shall
turn
out
to
be
the
hero
of
my
own
life
,
or
whether
that
*NL*
station
will
be
held
by
anybody
else
,
these
pages
must
show
.
To
begin
my
*NL*
life
with
the
beginning
of
my
life
,
I
record
that
I
was
born
-LRB-
as
I
have
*NL*
been
informed
and
believe
-RRB-
on
a
Friday
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
.
It
*NL*
was
remarked
that
the
clock
began
to
strike
,
and
I
began
to
cry
,
*NL*
simultaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
consideration
of
the
day
and
hour
of
my
birth
,
it
was
declared
by
the
*NL*
nurse
,
and
by
some
sage
women
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
taken
a
*NL*
lively
interest
in
me
several
months
before
there
was
any
possibility
of
*NL*
our
becoming
personally
acquainted
,
first
,
that
I
was
destined
to
be
*NL*
unlucky
in
life
;
and
secondly
,
that
I
was
privileged
to
see
ghosts
and
*NL*
spirits
;
both
these
gifts
inevitably
attaching
,
as
they
believed
,
to
all
*NL*
unlucky
infants
of
either
gender
,
born
towards
the
small
hours
on
a
*NL*
Friday
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
need
say
nothing
here
,
on
the
first
head
,
because
nothing
can
show
*NL*
better
than
my
history
whether
that
prediction
was
verified
or
falsified
*NL*
by
the
result
.
On
the
second
branch
of
the
question
,
I
will
only
remark
,
*NL*
that
unless
I
ran
through
that
part
of
my
inheritance
while
I
was
still
*NL*
a
baby
,
I
have
not
come
into
it
yet
.
But
I
do
not
at
all
complain
of
*NL*
having
been
kept
out
of
this
property
;
and
if
anybody
else
should
be
in
*NL*
the
present
enjoyment
of
it
,
he
is
heartily
welcome
to
keep
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
born
with
a
caul
,
which
was
advertised
for
sale
,
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
,
at
the
low
price
of
fifteen
guineas
.
Whether
sea-going
*NL*
people
were
short
of
money
about
that
time
,
or
were
short
of
faith
*NL*
and
preferred
cork-jackets
,
I
do
n't
know
;
all
I
know
is
,
that
there
*NL*
was
but
one
solitary
bidding
,
and
that
was
from
an
attorney
connected
*NL*
with
the
bill-broking
business
,
who
offered
two
pounds
in
cash
,
and
*NL*
the
balance
in
sherry
,
but
declined
to
be
guaranteed
from
drowning
*NL*
on
any
higher
bargain
.
Consequently
the
advertisement
was
withdrawn
*NL*
at
a
dead
loss
--
for
as
to
sherry
,
my
poor
dear
mother
's
own
sherry
*NL*
was
in
the
market
then
--
and
ten
years
afterwards
the
caul
was
put
*NL*
up
in
a
raffle
down
in
our
part
of
the
country
,
to
fifty
members
at
*NL*
half-a-crown
a
head
,
the
winner
to
spend
five
shillings
.
I
was
present
*NL*
myself
,
and
I
remember
to
have
felt
quite
uncomfortable
and
confused
,
*NL*
at
a
part
of
myself
being
disposed
of
in
that
way
.
The
caul
was
won
,
I
*NL*
recollect
,
by
an
old
lady
with
a
hand-basket
,
who
,
very
reluctantly
,
*NL*
produced
from
it
the
stipulated
five
shillings
,
all
in
halfpence
,
and
*NL*
twopence
halfpenny
short
--
as
it
took
an
immense
time
and
a
great
waste
*NL*
of
arithmetic
,
to
endeavour
without
any
effect
to
prove
to
her
.
It
is
*NL*
a
fact
which
will
be
long
remembered
as
remarkable
down
there
,
that
*NL*
she
was
never
drowned
,
but
died
triumphantly
in
bed
,
at
ninety-two
.
*NL*
I
have
understood
that
it
was
,
to
the
last
,
her
proudest
boast
,
that
*NL*
she
never
had
been
on
the
water
in
her
life
,
except
upon
a
bridge
;
and
*NL*
that
over
her
tea
-LRB-
to
which
she
was
extremely
partial
-RRB-
she
,
to
the
*NL*
last
,
expressed
her
indignation
at
the
impiety
of
mariners
and
others
,
*NL*
who
had
the
presumption
to
go
``
meandering
''
about
the
world
.
It
was
in
*NL*
vain
to
represent
to
her
that
some
conveniences
,
tea
perhaps
included
,
*NL*
resulted
from
this
objectionable
practice
.
She
always
returned
,
with
*NL*
greater
emphasis
and
with
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
strength
of
*NL*
her
objection
,
``
Let
us
have
no
meandering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
meander
,
myself
,
at
present
,
I
will
go
back
to
my
birth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
born
at
Blunderstone
,
in
Suffolk
,
or
``
thereby
,
''
as
they
say
in
*NL*
Scotland
.
I
was
a
posthumous
child
.
My
father
's
eyes
had
closed
upon
*NL*
the
light
of
this
world
six
months
,
when
mine
opened
on
it
.
There
is
*NL*
something
strange
to
me
,
even
now
,
in
the
reflection
that
he
never
*NL*
saw
me
;
and
something
stranger
yet
in
the
shadowy
remembrance
that
I
*NL*
have
of
my
first
childish
associations
with
his
white
grave-stone
in
*NL*
the
church-yard
,
and
of
the
indefinable
compassion
I
used
to
feel
for
*NL*
it
lying
out
alone
there
in
the
dark
night
,
when
our
little
parlor
*NL*
was
warm
and
bright
with
fire
and
candle
,
and
the
doors
of
our
house
*NL*
were
--
almost
cruelly
,
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
--
bolted
and
locked
*NL*
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
aunt
of
my
father
's
,
and
consequently
a
great-aunt
of
mine
,
of
whom
I
*NL*
shall
have
more
to
relate
by
and
by
,
was
the
principal
magnate
of
our
*NL*
family
.
Miss
Trotwood
,
or
Miss
Betsey
,
as
my
poor
mother
always
called
*NL*
her
,
when
she
sufficiently
overcame
her
dread
of
this
formidable
*NL*
personage
to
mention
her
at
all
-LRB-
which
was
seldom
-RRB-
,
had
been
married
to
*NL*
a
husband
younger
than
herself
,
who
was
very
handsome
,
except
in
the
*NL*
sense
of
the
homely
adage
,
``
handsome
is
,
that
handsome
does
''
--
for
he
was
*NL*
strongly
suspected
of
having
beaten
Miss
Betsey
,
and
even
of
having
*NL*
once
,
on
a
disputed
question
of
supplies
,
made
some
hasty
but
determined
*NL*
arrangements
to
throw
her
out
of
a
two
pair
of
stairs
'
window
.
These
*NL*
evidences
of
an
incompatibility
of
temper
induced
Miss
Betsey
to
pay
him
*NL*
off
,
and
effect
a
separation
by
mutual
consent
.
He
went
to
India
with
*NL*
his
capital
,
and
there
,
according
to
a
wild
legend
in
our
family
,
he
was
*NL*
once
seen
riding
on
an
elephant
,
in
company
with
a
Baboon
;
but
I
think
*NL*
it
must
have
been
a
Baboo
--
or
a
Begum
.
Any
how
,
from
India
tidings
of
*NL*
his
death
reached
home
,
within
ten
years
.
How
they
affected
my
aunt
,
*NL*
nobody
knew
;
for
immediately
upon
the
separation
,
she
took
her
maiden
*NL*
name
again
,
bought
a
cottage
in
a
hamlet
on
the
sea-coast
a
long
way
*NL*
off
,
established
herself
there
as
a
single
woman
with
one
servant
,
and
*NL*
was
understood
to
live
secluded
,
ever
afterwards
,
in
an
inflexible
*NL*
retirement
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
once
been
a
favorite
of
hers
,
I
believe
;
but
she
was
*NL*
mortally
affronted
by
his
marriage
,
on
the
ground
that
my
mother
was
``
a
*NL*
wax
doll
.
''
She
had
never
seen
my
mother
,
but
she
knew
her
to
be
not
yet
*NL*
twenty
.
My
father
and
Miss
Betsey
never
met
again
.
He
was
double
my
*NL*
mother
's
age
when
he
married
,
and
of
but
a
delicate
constitution
.
He
*NL*
died
a
year
afterwards
,
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
six
months
before
I
came
*NL*
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
state
of
matters
,
on
the
afternoon
of
,
what
_
I
_
may
be
*NL*
excused
for
calling
,
that
eventful
and
important
Friday
.
I
can
make
no
*NL*
claim
therefore
to
have
known
,
at
that
time
,
how
matters
stood
;
or
to
*NL*
have
any
remembrance
,
founded
on
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
,
of
what
*NL*
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
but
poorly
in
health
,
and
very
low
in
*NL*
spirits
,
looking
at
it
through
her
tears
,
and
desponding
heavily
about
*NL*
herself
and
the
fatherless
little
stranger
,
who
was
already
welcomed
by
*NL*
some
grosses
of
prophetic
pins
,
in
a
drawer
up-stairs
,
to
a
world
not
at
*NL*
all
excited
on
the
subject
of
his
arrival
;
my
mother
,
I
say
,
was
sitting
*NL*
by
the
fire
,
that
bright
,
windy
March
afternoon
,
very
timid
and
sad
,
and
*NL*
very
doubtful
of
ever
coming
alive
out
of
the
trial
that
was
before
her
,
*NL*
when
,
lifting
her
eyes
as
she
dried
them
,
to
the
window
opposite
,
she
*NL*
saw
a
strange
lady
coming
up
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
had
a
sure
foreboding
at
the
second
glance
,
that
it
was
Miss
*NL*
Betsey
.
The
setting
sun
was
glowing
on
the
strange
lady
,
over
the
*NL*
garden-fence
,
and
she
came
walking
up
to
the
door
with
a
fell
rigidity
*NL*
of
figure
and
composure
of
countenance
that
could
have
belonged
to
*NL*
nobody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
reached
the
house
,
she
gave
another
proof
of
her
identity
.
My
*NL*
father
had
often
hinted
that
she
seldom
conducted
herself
like
any
*NL*
ordinary
Christian
;
and
now
,
instead
of
ringing
the
bell
,
she
came
and
*NL*
looked
in
at
that
identical
window
,
pressing
the
end
of
her
nose
against
*NL*
the
glass
to
that
extent
,
that
my
poor
dear
mother
used
to
say
it
became
*NL*
perfectly
flat
and
white
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
my
mother
such
a
turn
,
that
I
have
always
been
convinced
I
am
*NL*
indebted
to
Miss
Betsey
for
having
been
born
on
a
Friday
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
had
left
her
chair
in
her
agitation
,
and
gone
behind
it
in
the
*NL*
corner
.
Miss
Betsey
,
looking
round
the
room
,
slowly
and
enquiringly
,
*NL*
began
on
the
other
side
,
and
carried
her
eyes
on
,
like
a
Saracen
's
Head
*NL*
in
a
Dutch
clock
,
until
they
reached
my
mother
.
Then
she
made
a
frown
*NL*
and
a
gesture
to
my
mother
,
like
one
who
was
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
,
to
*NL*
come
and
open
the
door
.
My
mother
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
David
Copperfield
,
I
_
think
_
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
;
the
emphasis
*NL*
referring
,
perhaps
,
to
my
mother
's
mourning
weeds
,
and
her
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
my
mother
,
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
said
the
visitor
.
``
You
have
heard
of
her
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
answered
she
had
had
that
pleasure
.
And
she
had
a
disagreeable
*NL*
consciousness
of
not
appearing
to
imply
that
it
had
been
an
overpowering
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
see
her
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
My
mother
bent
her
head
,
and
begged
*NL*
her
to
walk
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
parlor
my
mother
had
come
from
,
the
fire
in
the
best
*NL*
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
not
being
lighted
--
not
having
been
*NL*
lighted
,
indeed
,
since
my
father
's
funeral
;
and
when
they
were
both
*NL*
seated
,
and
Miss
Betsey
said
nothing
,
my
mother
,
after
vainly
trying
to
*NL*
restrain
herself
,
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
''
said
Miss
Betsey
,
in
a
hurry
.
``
Do
n't
do
that
!
Come
,
*NL*
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
could
n't
help
it
notwithstanding
,
so
she
cried
until
she
had
*NL*
had
her
cry
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
off
your
cap
,
child
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
,
``
and
let
me
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
too
much
afraid
of
her
to
refuse
compliance
with
this
odd
*NL*
request
,
if
she
had
any
disposition
to
do
so
.
Therefore
she
did
as
she
*NL*
was
told
,
and
did
it
with
such
nervous
hands
that
her
hair
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
luxuriant
and
beautiful
-RRB-
fell
all
about
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
my
heart
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Betsey
.
``
You
are
a
very
Baby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
,
no
doubt
,
unusually
youthful
in
appearance
even
for
her
*NL*
years
;
she
hung
her
head
,
as
if
it
were
her
fault
,
poor
thing
,
and
said
,
*NL*
sobbing
,
that
indeed
she
was
afraid
she
was
but
a
childish
widow
,
and
*NL*
would
be
but
a
childish
mother
if
she
lived
.
In
a
short
pause
which
*NL*
ensued
,
she
had
a
fancy
that
she
felt
Miss
Betsey
touch
her
hair
,
and
*NL*
that
with
no
ungentle
hand
;
but
,
looking
at
her
,
in
her
timid
hope
,
she
*NL*
found
that
lady
sitting
with
the
skirt
of
her
dress
tucked
up
,
her
hands
*NL*
folded
on
one
knee
,
and
her
feet
upon
the
fender
,
frowning
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
Heaven
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
,
suddenly
,
``
why
Rookery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
the
house
,
ma'am
?
''
asked
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
Rookery
?
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
``
Cookery
would
have
been
more
to
the
*NL*
purpose
,
if
you
had
had
any
practical
ideas
of
life
,
either
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
was
Mr.
Copperfield
's
choice
,
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
When
he
*NL*
bought
the
house
,
he
liked
to
think
that
there
were
rooks
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
wind
made
such
a
disturbance
just
now
,
among
some
tall
old
*NL*
elm-trees
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
that
neither
my
mother
nor
Miss
*NL*
Betsey
could
forbear
glancing
that
way
.
As
the
elms
bent
to
one
another
,
*NL*
like
giants
who
were
whispering
secrets
,
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
such
*NL*
repose
,
fell
into
a
violent
flurry
,
tossing
their
wild
arms
about
,
as
if
*NL*
their
late
confidences
were
really
too
wicked
for
their
peace
of
mind
,
*NL*
some
weather-beaten
ragged
old
rooks
'
-
nests
,
burdening
their
higher
*NL*
branches
,
swung
like
wrecks
upon
a
stormy
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
birds
?
''
asked
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
--
?
''
My
mother
had
been
thinking
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rooks
--
what
has
become
of
them
?
''
asked
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
have
not
been
any
since
we
have
lived
here
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
We
*NL*
thought
--
Mr.
Copperfield
thought
--
it
was
quite
a
large
rookery
;
but
the
*NL*
nests
were
very
old
ones
,
and
the
birds
have
deserted
them
a
long
*NL*
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
all
over
!
''
cried
Miss
Betsey
.
``
David
Copperfield
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
!
Calls
a
house
a
rookery
when
there
's
not
a
rook
near
it
,
*NL*
and
takes
the
birds
on
trust
,
because
he
sees
the
nests
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
returned
my
mother
,
``
is
dead
,
and
if
you
dare
to
*NL*
speak
unkindly
of
him
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
poor
dear
mother
,
I
suppose
,
had
some
momentary
intention
of
*NL*
committing
an
assault
and
battery
upon
my
aunt
,
who
could
easily
have
*NL*
settled
her
with
one
hand
,
even
if
my
mother
had
been
in
far
better
*NL*
training
for
such
an
encounter
than
she
was
that
evening
.
But
it
passed
*NL*
with
the
action
of
rising
from
her
chair
;
and
she
sat
down
again
very
*NL*
meekly
,
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
to
herself
,
or
when
Miss
Betsey
had
restored
her
,
*NL*
whichever
it
was
,
she
found
the
latter
standing
at
the
window
.
The
*NL*
twilight
was
by
this
time
shading
down
into
darkness
;
and
dimly
as
they
*NL*
saw
each
other
,
they
could
not
have
done
that
without
the
aid
of
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Miss
Betsey
,
coming
back
to
her
chair
,
as
if
she
had
only
*NL*
been
taking
a
casual
look
at
the
prospect
;
``
and
when
do
you
expect
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
all
in
a
tremble
,
''
faltered
my
mother
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
's
the
*NL*
matter
.
I
shall
die
,
I
am
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
``
Have
some
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
me
,
dear
me
,
do
you
think
it
will
do
me
any
good
?
''
cried
my
*NL*
mother
in
a
helpless
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
will
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
``
It
's
nothing
but
fancy
.
What
do
*NL*
you
call
your
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
will
be
a
girl
,
yet
,
ma'am
,
''
said
my
mother
*NL*
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
the
Baby
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Betsey
,
unconsciously
quoting
the
*NL*
second
sentiment
of
the
pincushion
in
the
drawer
up-stairs
,
but
*NL*
applying
it
to
my
mother
instead
of
me
,
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
I
mean
your
*NL*
servant-girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
,
''
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
!
''
repeated
Miss
Betsey
,
with
some
indignation
.
``
Do
you
mean
to
*NL*
say
,
child
,
that
any
human
being
has
gone
into
a
Christian
church
,
and
*NL*
got
herself
named
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
her
surname
,
''
said
my
mother
,
faintly
.
``
Mr.
Copperfield
called
her
*NL*
by
it
,
because
her
Christian
name
was
the
same
as
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
Peggotty
!
''
cried
Miss
Betsey
,
opening
the
parlor-door
.
``
Tea
.
Your
*NL*
mistress
is
a
little
unwell
.
Do
n't
dawdle

''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
issued
this
mandate
with
as
much
potentiality
as
if
she
had
been
*NL*
a
recognised
authority
in
the
house
ever
since
it
had
been
a
house
,
and
*NL*
having
looked
out
to
confront
the
amazed
Peggotty
coming
along
the
*NL*
passage
with
a
candle
at
the
sound
of
a
strange
voice
,
Miss
Betsey
shut
*NL*
the
door
again
,
and
sat
down
as
before
:
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
,
the
*NL*
skirt
of
her
dress
tucked
up
,
and
her
hands
folded
on
one
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
speaking
about
its
being
a
girl
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
``
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
it
will
be
a
girl
.
I
have
a
presentiment
that
it
must
be
a
girl
.
*NL*
Now
child
,
from
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
this
girl
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
boy
,
''
my
mother
took
the
liberty
of
putting
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
have
a
presentiment
that
it
must
be
a
girl

returned
Miss
*NL*
Betsey
.
``
Do
n't
contradict
.
From
the
moment
of
this
girl
's
birth
,
child
,
*NL*
I
intend
to
be
her
friend
.
I
intend
to
be
her
godmother
,
and
I
beg
*NL*
you
'll
call
her
Betsey
Trotwood
Copperfield
.
There
must
be
no
mistakes
*NL*
in
life
with

this
_
Betsey
Trotwood
.
There
must
be
no
trifling
with
*NL*
_
her

affections
,
poor
dear

She
must
be
well
brought
up
,
and
well
*NL*
guarded
from
reposing
any
foolish
confidences
where
they
are
not
*NL*
deserved
.
I
must
make
that

my

care

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
twitch
of
Miss
Betsey
's
head
,
after
each
of
these
sentences
,
*NL*
as
if
her
own
old
wrongs
were
working
within
her
,
and
she
repressed
any
*NL*
plainer
reference
to
them
by
strong
constraint
.
So
my
mother
suspected
,
*NL*
at
least
,
as
she
observed
her
by
the
low
glimmer
of
the
fire
:
too
much
*NL*
scared
by
Miss
Betsey
,
too
uneasy
in
herself
,
and
too
subdued
and
*NL*
bewildered
altogether
,
to
observe
anything
very
clearly
,
or
to
know
what
*NL*
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
David
good
to
you
,
child
?
''
asked
Miss
Betsey
,
when
she
had
been
*NL*
silent
for
a
little
while
,
and
these
motions
of
her
head
had
gradually
*NL*
ceased
.
``
Were
you
comfortable
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
very
happy
,

said
my
mother
.
``
Mr.
Copperfield
was
only
too
good
*NL*
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
he
spoilt
you
,
I
suppose
?
''
returned
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
being
quite
alone
and
dependent
on
myself
in
this
rough
world
*NL*
again
,
yes
,
I
fear
he
did
indeed
,
''
sobbed
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Do
n't
cry
!
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
``
You
were
not
equally
matched
,
*NL*
child
--
if
any
two
people
_
can
_
be
equally
matched

and
so
I
asked
the
*NL*
question
.
You
were
an
orphan

were
n't
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
nursery-governess
in
a
family
where
Mr.
Copperfield
came
to
*NL*
visit
.
Mr.
Copperfield
was
very
kind
to
me
,
and
took
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
notice
of
me
,
and
paid
me
a
good
deal
of
attention
,
and
at
last
proposed
*NL*
to
me
.
And
I
accepted
him
.
And
so
we
were
married
,
''
said
my
mother
*NL*
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
poor
Baby
!
''
mused
Miss
Betsey
,
with
her
frown
still
bent
upon
the
*NL*
fire
.
``
Do
you
know
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

faltered
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
keeping

for
instance

said
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much

fear

returned
my
mother
.
``
Not
so
much
as
I
could
wish

*NL*
But
Mr.

was
teaching
me
--

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Much
he
knew
about
it
himself

-RRB-
said
Miss
Betsey
in
a
parenthesis
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
And
I
hope
I
should
have
improved
,
being
very
anxious
to
learn

and
*NL*
he
very
patient
to
teach
,
if
the
great
misfortune
of
his
death
''
--
my
*NL*
mother
broke
down
again
here
,
and
could
get
no
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
I
kept
my
housekeeping-book
regularly
,
and
balanced
it
with
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
every
night
,

cried
my
mother
in
another
burst
of
distress
,
*NL*
and
breaking
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
Miss
Betsey
.
``
Do
n't
cry
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
And
I
am
sure
we
never
had
a
word
of
difference
respecting
it
,
except
*NL*
when
Mr.
Copperfield
objected
to
my
threes
and
fives
being
too
much
like
*NL*
each
other
,
or
to
my
putting
curly
tails
to
my
sevens
and
nines
,
''
*NL*
resumed
my
mother
in
another
burst
,
and
breaking
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
make
yourself
ill
,
''
said
Miss
Betsey
,
``
and
you
know
that
will
*NL*
not
be
good
either
for
you
or
for
my
god-daughter
.
Come
!
You
must
n't
do
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
argument
had
some
share
in
quieting
my
mother
,
though
her
*NL*
increasing
indisposition
perhaps
had
a
larger
one
.
There
was
an
interval
*NL*
of
silence
,
only
broken
by
Miss
Betsey
's
occasionally
ejaculating
``
Ha
!
''
*NL*
as
she
sat
with
her
feet
upon
the
fender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
had
bought
an
annuity
for
himself
with
his
money
,
I
know
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
by
and
by
.
``
What
did
he
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
my
mother
,
answering
with
some
difficulty
,
``
was
*NL*
so
considerate
and
good
as
to
secure
the
reversion
of
a
part
of
it
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
asked
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
and
five
pounds
a
year
,
''
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
have
done
worse
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
was
appropriate
to
the
moment
.
My
mother
was
so
much
worse
that
*NL*
Peggotty
,
coming
in
with
the
teaboard
and
candles
,
and
seeing
at
a
*NL*
glance
how
ill
she
was
,
--
as
Miss
Betsey
might
have
done
sooner
if
there
*NL*
had
been
light
enough
,
--
conveyed
her
up-stairs
to
her
own
room
with
all
*NL*
speed
;
and
immediately
dispatched
Ham
Peggotty
,
her
nephew
,
who
had
been
*NL*
for
some
days
past
secreted
in
the
house
,
unknown
to
my
mother
,
as
a
*NL*
special
messenger
in
case
of
emergency
,
to
fetch
the
nurse
and
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
allied
powers
were
considerably
astonished
,
when
they
arrived
*NL*
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
,
to
find
an
unknown
lady
of
*NL*
portentous
appearance
,
sitting
before
the
fire
,
with
her
bonnet
tied
*NL*
over
her
left
arm
,
stopping
her
ears
with
jewellers
'
cotton
.
Peggotty
*NL*
knowing
nothing
about
her
,
and
my
mother
saying
nothing
about
her
,
she
*NL*
was
quite
a
mystery
in
the
parlor
;
and
the
fact
of
her
having
a
magazine
*NL*
of
jewellers
'
cotton
in
her
pocket
,
and
sticking
the
article
in
her
ears
*NL*
in
that
way
,
did
not
detract
from
the
solemnity
of
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
having
been
up-stairs
and
come
down
again
,
and
having
*NL*
satisfied
himself
,
I
suppose
,
that
there
was
a
probability
of
this
*NL*
unknown
lady
and
himself
having
to
sit
there
,
face
to
face
,
for
some
*NL*
hours
,
laid
himself
out
to
be
polite
and
social
.
He
was
the
meekest
of
*NL*
his
sex
,
the
mildest
of
little
men
.
He
sidled
in
and
out
of
a
room
,
to
*NL*
take
up
the
less
space
.
He
walked
as
softly
as
the
Ghost
in
Hamlet
,
and
*NL*
more
slowly
.
He
carried
his
head
on
one
side
,
partly
in
modest
*NL*
depreciation
of
himself
,
partly
in
modest
propitiation
of
everybody
*NL*
else
.
It
is
nothing
to
say
that
he
had
n't
a
word
to
throw
at
a
dog
.
He
*NL*
could
n't
have
_
thrown
_
a
word
at
a
mad
dog
.
He
might
have
offered
him
*NL*
one
gently
,
or
half
a
one
,
or
a
fragment
of
one
;
for
he
spoke
as
slowly
*NL*
as
he
walked
;
but
he
would
n't
have
been
rude
to
him
,
and
he
could
n't
*NL*
have
been
quick
with
him
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
,
looking
mildly
at
my
aunt
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
*NL*
making
her
a
little
bow
,
said
,
in
allusion
to
the
jewellers
'
cotton
,
as
*NL*
he
softly
touched
his
left
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
local
irritation
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
replied
my
aunt
,
pulling
the
cotton
out
of
one
ear
like
a
cork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
was
so
alarmed
by
her
abruptness
--
as
he
told
my
mother
*NL*
afterwards
--
that
it
was
a
mercy
he
did
n't
lose
his
presence
of
mind
.
But
*NL*
he
repeated
,
sweetly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
local
irritation
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
replied
my
aunt
,
and
corked
herself
again
,
at
one
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
could
do
nothing
after
this
,
but
sit
and
look
at
her
feebly
,
*NL*
as
she
sat
and
looked
at
the
fire
,
until
he
was
called
up-stairs
again
.
*NL*
After
some
quarter
of
an
hour
's
absence
,
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
taking
the
cotton
out
of
the
ear
nearest
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
''
returned
Mr.
Chillip
,
``
we
are
--
we
are
progressing
slowly
,
*NL*
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ba
--
a
--
ah
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
perfect
shake
on
the
contemptuous
*NL*
interjection
.
And
corked
herself
,
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Really
--
really
--
as
Mr.
Chillip
told
my
mother
,
he
was
almost
shocked
;
*NL*
speaking
in
a
professional
point
of
view
alone
,
he
was
almost
shocked
.
*NL*
But
he
sat
and
looked
at
her
,
notwithstanding
,
for
nearly
two
hours
,
as
*NL*
she
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
until
he
was
again
called
out
.
After
*NL*
another
absence
,
he
again
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
taking
out
the
cotton
on
that
side
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
''
returned
Mr.
Chillip
,
``
we
are
--
we
are
progressing
slowly
,
*NL*
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ya
--
a
--
ah
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
With
such
a
snarl
at
him
,
that
Mr.
Chillip
*NL*
absolutely
could
not
bear
it
.
It
was
really
calculated
to
break
his
*NL*
spirit
,
he
said
afterwards
.
He
preferred
to
go
and
sit
upon
the
stairs
,
*NL*
in
the
dark
and
a
strong
draught
,
until
he
was
again
sent
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
Peggotty
,
who
went
to
the
national
school
,
and
was
a
very
dragon
at
*NL*
his
catechism
,
and
who
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
a
credible
witness
,
*NL*
reported
next
day
,
that
happening
to
peep
in
at
the
parlor-door
an
hour
*NL*
after
this
,
he
was
instantly
descried
by
Miss
Betsey
,
then
walking
to
*NL*
and
fro
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
and
pounced
upon
before
he
could
make
*NL*
his
escape
.
That
there
were
now
occasional
sounds
of
feet
and
voices
*NL*
overhead
which
he
inferred
the
cotton
did
not
exclude
,
from
the
*NL*
circumstance
of
his
evidently
being
clutched
by
the
lady
as
a
victim
on
*NL*
whom
to
expend
her
superabundant
agitation
when
the
sounds
were
loudest
.
*NL*
That
,
marching
him
constantly
up
and
down
by
the
collar
-LRB-
as
if
he
had
*NL*
been
taking
too
much
laudanum
-RRB-
,
she
,
at
those
times
,
shook
him
,
rumpled
*NL*
his
hair
,
made
light
of
his
linen
,
stopped
_
his
_
ears
as
if
she
*NL*
confounded
them
with
her
own
,
and
otherwise
touzled
and
maltreated
him
.
*NL*
This
was
in
part
confirmed
by
his
aunt
,
who
saw
him
at
half-past
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
,
soon
after
his
release
,
and
affirmed
that
he
was
then
as
red
as
*NL*
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mild
Mr.
Chillip
could
not
possibly
bear
malice
at
such
a
time
,
if
*NL*
at
any
time
.
He
sidled
into
the
parlor
as
soon
as
he
was
at
liberty
,
and
*NL*
said
to
my
aunt
in
his
meekest
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
am
happy
to
congratulate
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
upon
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
was
fluttered
again
,
by
the
extreme
severity
of
my
aunt
's
*NL*
manner
;
so
he
made
her
a
little
bow
and
gave
her
a
little
smile
,
to
*NL*
mollify
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
the
man
,
what
's
he
doing
!
''
cried
my
aunt
,
impatiently
.
``
Ca
n't
*NL*
he
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
in
his
softest
accents
.
*NL*
``
There
is
no
longer
any
occasion
for
uneasiness
,
ma'am
.
Be
calm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
since
been
considered
almost
a
miracle
that
my
aunt
did
n't
shake
*NL*
him
,
and
shake
what
he
had
to
say
,
out
of
him
.
She
only
shook
her
own
*NL*
head
at
him
,
but
in
a
way
that
made
him
quail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
''
resumed
Mr.
Chillip
,
as
soon
as
he
had
courage
,
``
I
am
*NL*
happy
to
congratulate
you
.
All
is
now
over
,
ma'am
,
and
well
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
five
minutes
or
so
that
Mr.
Chillip
devoted
to
the
delivery
*NL*
of
this
oration
,
my
aunt
eyed
him
narrowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
folding
her
arms
with
her
bonnet
still
tied
*NL*
on
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
she
will
soon
be
quite
comfortable
,
I
hope
,
''
returned
Mr.
*NL*
Chillip
.
``
Quite
as
comfortable
as
we
can
expect
a
young
mother
to
be
,
*NL*
under
these
melancholy
domestic
circumstances
.
There
can
not
be
any
*NL*
objection
to
your
seeing
her
presently
,
ma'am
.
It
may
do
her
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
_
she
_
.
How
is
_
she
_
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
laid
his
head
a
little
more
on
one
side
,
and
looked
at
my
*NL*
aunt
like
an
amiable
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
baby
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
How
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma'am
,
''
returned
Mr.
Chillip
,
``
I
apprehended
you
had
known
.
It
's
a
*NL*
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
said
never
a
word
,
but
took
her
bonnet
by
the
strings
,
in
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
sling
,
aimed
a
blow
at
Mr.
Chillip
's
head
with
it
,
put
it
on
*NL*
bent
,
walked
out
,
and
never
came
back
.
She
vanished
like
a
discontented
*NL*
fairy
;
or
like
one
of
those
supernatural
beings
,
whom
it
was
popularly
*NL*
supposed
I
was
entitled
to
see
;
and
never
came
back
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
I
lay
in
my
basket
,
and
my
mother
lay
in
her
bed
;
but
Betsey
*NL*
Trotwood
Copperfield
was
for
ever
in
the
land
of
dreams
and
shadows
,
the
*NL*
tremendous
region
whence
I
had
so
lately
travelled
;
and
the
light
upon
*NL*
the
window
of
our
room
shone
out
upon
the
earthly
bourne
of
all
such
*NL*
travellers
,
and
the
mound
above
the
ashes
and
the
dust
that
once
was
he
,
*NL*
without
whom
I
had
never
been
.

CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
OBSERVE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
objects
that
assume
a
distinct
presence
before
me
,
as
I
look
*NL*
far
back
,
into
the
blank
of
my
infancy
,
are
my
mother
with
her
pretty
*NL*
hair
and
youthful
shape
,
and
Peggotty
with
no
shape
at
all
,
and
eyes
so
*NL*
dark
that
they
seemed
to
darken
their
whole
neighbourhood
in
her
face
,
*NL*
and
cheeks
and
arms
so
hard
and
red
that
I
wondered
the
birds
did
n't
*NL*
peck
her
in
preference
to
apples
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
I
can
remember
these
two
at
a
little
distance
apart
,
dwarfed
*NL*
to
my
sight
by
stooping
down
or
kneeling
on
the
floor
,
and
I
going
*NL*
unsteadily
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
I
have
an
impression
on
my
mind
*NL*
which
I
can
not
distinguish
from
actual
remembrance
,
of
the
touch
of
*NL*
Peggotty
's
fore-finger
as
she
used
to
hold
it
out
to
me
,
and
of
its
*NL*
being
roughened
by
needlework
,
like
a
pocket
nutmeg-grater
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
may
be
fancy
,
though
I
think
the
memory
of
most
of
us
can
go
*NL*
farther
back
into
such
times
than
many
of
us
suppose
;
just
as
I
believe
*NL*
the
power
of
observation
in
numbers
of
very
young
children
to
be
quite
*NL*
wonderful
for
its
closeness
and
accuracy
.
Indeed
,
I
think
that
most
*NL*
grown
men
who
are
remarkable
in
this
respect
,
may
with
greater
propriety
*NL*
be
said
not
to
have
lost
the
faculty
,
than
to
have
acquired
it
;
the
*NL*
rather
,
as
I
generally
observe
such
men
to
retain
a
certain
freshness
,
*NL*
and
gentleness
,
and
capacity
of
being
pleased
,
which
are
also
an
*NL*
inheritance
they
have
preserved
from
their
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
a
misgiving
that
I
am
``
meandering
''
in
stopping
to
say
this
,
*NL*
but
that
it
brings
me
to
remark
that
I
build
these
conclusions
,
in
part
*NL*
upon
my
own
experience
of
myself
;
and
if
it
should
appear
from
anything
*NL*
I
may
set
down
in
this
narrative
that
I
was
a
child
of
close
*NL*
observation
,
or
that
as
a
man
I
have
a
strong
memory
of
my
childhood
,
I
*NL*
undoubtedly
lay
claim
to
both
of
these
characteristics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
back
,
as
I
was
saying
,
into
the
blank
of
my
infancy
,
the
first
*NL*
objects
I
can
remember
as
standing
out
by
themselves
from
a
confusion
of
*NL*
things
,
are
my
mother
and
Peggotty
.
What
else
do
I
remember
?
Let
me
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
comes
out
of
the
cloud
,
our
house
--
not
new
to
me
,
but
quite
*NL*
familiar
,
in
its
earliest
remembrance
.
On
the
ground-floor
is
Peggotty
's
*NL*
kitchen
,
opening
into
a
back
yard
;
with
a
pigeon-house
on
a
pole
,
in
the
*NL*
centre
,
without
any
pigeons
in
it
;
a
great
dog-kennel
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
without
any
dog
;
and
a
quantity
of
fowls
that
look
terribly
tall
to
me
,
*NL*
walking
about
,
in
a
menacing
and
ferocious
manner
.
There
is
one
cock
who
*NL*
gets
upon
a
post
to
crow
,
and
seems
to
take
particular
notice
of
me
as
I
*NL*
look
at
him
through
the
kitchen-window
,
who
makes
me
shiver
,
he
is
so
*NL*
fierce
.
Of
the
geese
outside
the
side-gate
who
come
waddling
after
me
*NL*
with
their
long
necks
stretched
out
when
I
go
that
way
,
I
dream
at
*NL*
night
:
as
a
man
environed
by
wild
beasts
might
dream
of
lions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
is
a
long
passage
--
what
an
enormous
perspective
I
make
of
*NL*
it
!
--
leading
from
Peggotty
's
kitchen
to
the
front-door
.
A
dark
*NL*
store-room
opens
out
of
it
,
and
that
is
a
place
to
be
run
past
at
*NL*
night
;
for
I
do
n't
know
what
may
be
among
those
tubs
and
jars
and
old
*NL*
tea-chests
,
when
there
is
nobody
in
there
with
a
dimly-burning
light
,
*NL*
letting
a
mouldy
air
come
out
at
the
door
,
in
which
there
is
the
smell
*NL*
of
soap
,
pickles
,
pepper
,
candles
,
and
coffee
,
all
at
one
whiff
.
Then
*NL*
there
are
the
two
parlors
:
the
parlor
in
which
we
sit
of
an
evening
,
my
*NL*
mother
and
I
and
Peggotty
--
for
Peggotty
is
quite
our
companion
,
when
*NL*
her
work
is
done
and
we
are
alone
--
and
the
best
parlor
where
we
sit
*NL*
on
a
Sunday
;
grandly
,
but
not
so
comfortably
.
There
is
something
of
a
*NL*
doleful
air
about
that
room
to
me
,
for
Peggotty
has
told
me
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
when
,
but
apparently
ages
ago
--
about
my
father
's
funeral
,
and
the
*NL*
company
having
their
black
cloaks
put
on
.
One
Sunday
night
my
mother
*NL*
reads
to
Peggotty
and
me
in
there
,
how
Lazarus
was
raised
up
from
the
*NL*
dead
.
And
I
am
so
frightened
that
they
are
afterwards
obliged
to
take
*NL*
me
out
of
bed
,
and
shew
me
the
quiet
churchyard
out
of
the
bedroom
*NL*
window
,
with
the
dead
all
lying
in
their
graves
at
rest
,
below
the
*NL*
solemn
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
half
so
green
that
I
know
anywhere
,
as
the
grass
of
*NL*
that
churchyard
;
nothing
half
so
shady
as
its
trees
;
nothing
half
so
*NL*
quiet
as
its
tombstones
.
The
sheep
are
feeding
there
,
when
I
kneel
*NL*
up
,
early
in
the
morning
,
in
my
little
bed
in
a
closet
within
my
*NL*
mother
's
room
,
to
look
out
at
it
;
and
I
see
the
red
light
shining
on
*NL*
the
sun-dial
,
and
think
within
myself
,
``
Is
the
sun-dial
glad
,
I
wonder
,
*NL*
that
it
can
tell
the
time
again
?

Our
Pew
at
Church
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Here
is
our
pew
in
the
church
.
What
a
high-backed
pew
!
With
a
window
*NL*
near
it
,
out
of
which
our
house
can
be
seen
,
and
_
is
_
seen
many
times
*NL*
during
the
morning
's
service
,
by
Peggotty
,
who
likes
to
make
herself
as
*NL*
sure
as
she
can
that
it
's
not
being
robbed
,
or
is
not
in
flames
.
But
*NL*
though
Peggotty
's
eye
wanders
,
she
is
much
offended
if
mine
does
,
and
*NL*
frowns
to
me
,
as
I
stand
upon
the
seat
,
that
I
am
to
look
at
the
*NL*
clergyman
.
But
I
ca
n't
always
look
at
him
--
I
know
him
without
that
white
*NL*
thing
on
,
and
I
am
afraid
of
his
wondering
why
I
stare
so
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
stopping
the
service
to
enquire
--
and
what
am
I
to
do
?
It
's
a
dreadful
*NL*
thing
to
gape
,
but
I
must
do
something
.
I
look
at
my
mother
,
but
_
she
_
*NL*
pretends
not
to
see
me
.
I
look
at
a
boy
in
the
aisle
,
and
_
he
_
makes
*NL*
faces
at
me
.
I
look
at
the
sunlight
coming
in
at
the
open
door
through
*NL*
the
porch
,
and
there
I
see
a
stray
sheep
--
I
do
n't
mean
a
sinner
,
but
*NL*
mutton
--
half
making
up
his
mind
to
come
into
the
church
.
I
feel
that
if
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
any
longer
,
I
might
be
tempted
to
say
something
out
*NL*
loud
;
and
what
would
become
of
me
then
!
I
look
up
at
the
monumental
*NL*
tablets
on
the
wall
,
and
try
to
think
of
Mr.
Bodgers
late
of
this
*NL*
parish
,
and
what
the
feelings
of
Mrs.
Bodgers
must
have
been
,
when
*NL*
affliction
sore
,
long
time
Mr.
Bodgers
bore
,
and
physicians
were
in
*NL*
vain
.
I
wonder
whether
they
called
in
Mr.
Chillip
,
and
he
was
in
vain
;
*NL*
and
if
so
,
how
he
likes
to
be
reminded
of
it
once
a
week
.
I
look
from
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
,
in
his
Sunday
neckcloth
,
to
the
pulpit
;
and
think
what
a
*NL*
good
place
it
would
be
to
play
in
,
and
what
a
castle
it
would
make
,
with
*NL*
another
boy
coming
up
the
stairs
to
attack
it
,
and
having
the
velvet
*NL*
cushion
with
the
tassels
thrown
down
on
his
head
.
In
time
my
eyes
*NL*
gradually
shut
up
;
and
,
from
seeming
to
hear
the
clergyman
singing
a
*NL*
drowsy
song
in
the
heat
,
I
hear
nothing
,
until
I
fall
off
the
seat
with
*NL*
a
crash
,
and
am
taken
out
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
by
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
see
the
outside
of
our
house
,
with
the
latticed
*NL*
bedroom-windows
standing
open
to
let
in
the
sweet-smelling
air
,
and
*NL*
the
ragged
old
rooks
'
-
nests
still
dangling
in
the
elm-trees
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
front
garden
.
Now
I
am
in
the
garden
at
the
back
,
beyond
*NL*
the
yard
where
the
empty
pigeon-house
and
dog-kennel
are
--
a
very
*NL*
preserve
of
butterflies
,
as
I
remember
it
,
with
a
high
fence
,
and
a
*NL*
gate
and
padlock
;
where
the
fruit
clusters
on
the
trees
,
riper
and
*NL*
richer
than
fruit
has
ever
been
since
,
in
any
other
garden
,
and
where
*NL*
my
mother
gathers
some
in
a
basket
,
while
I
stand
by
,
bolting
furtive
*NL*
gooseberries
,
and
trying
to
look
unmoved
.
A
great
wind
rises
,
and
the
*NL*
summer
is
gone
in
a
moment
.
We
are
playing
in
the
winter
twilight
,
*NL*
dancing
about
the
parlor
.
When
my
mother
is
out
of
breath
and
rests
*NL*
herself
in
an
elbow-chair
,
I
watch
her
winding
her
bright
curls
round
*NL*
her
fingers
,
and
straitening
her
waist
,
and
nobody
knows
better
than
I
*NL*
do
that
she
likes
to
look
so
well
,
and
is
proud
of
being
so
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
among
my
very
earliest
impressions
.
That
,
and
a
sense
that
we
*NL*
were
both
a
little
afraid
of
Peggotty
,
and
submitted
ourselves
in
most
*NL*
things
to
her
direction
,
were
among
the
first
opinions
--
if
they
may
be
*NL*
so
called
--
that
I
ever
derived
from
what
I
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
and
I
were
sitting
one
night
by
the
parlor
fire
,
alone
.
I
*NL*
had
been
reading
to
Peggotty
about
crocodiles
.
I
must
have
read
very
*NL*
perspicuously
,
or
the
poor
soul
must
have
been
deeply
interested
,
for
*NL*
I
remember
she
had
a
cloudy
impression
,
after
I
had
done
,
that
they
*NL*
were
a
sort
of
vegetable
.
I
was
tired
of
reading
,
and
dead
sleepy
;
*NL*
but
having
leave
,
as
a
high
treat
,
to
sit
up
until
my
mother
came
*NL*
home
from
spending
the
evening
at
a
neighbour
's
,
I
would
rather
have
*NL*
died
upon
my
post
-LRB-
of
course
-RRB-
than
have
gone
to
bed
.
I
had
reached
*NL*
that
stage
of
sleepiness
when
Peggotty
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
*NL*
immensely
large
.
I
propped
my
eyelids
open
with
my
two
forefingers
,
*NL*
and
looked
perseveringly
at
her
as
she
sat
at
work
;
at
the
little
bit
*NL*
of
wax-candle
she
kept
for
her
thread
--
how
old
it
looked
,
being
so
*NL*
wrinkled
in
all
directions
!
--
at
the
little
house
with
a
thatched
roof
,
*NL*
where
the
yard-measure
lived
;
at
her
work-box
with
a
sliding
lid
,
with
*NL*
a
view
of
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
-LRB-
with
a
pink
dome
-RRB-
painted
on
the
*NL*
top
;
at
the
brass
thimble
on
her
finger
;
at
herself
,
whom
I
thought
*NL*
lovely
.
I
felt
so
sleepy
,
that
I
knew
if
I
lost
sight
of
anything
,
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
I
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
,
''
says
I
,
suddenly
,
``
were
you
ever
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
Master
Davy
,
''
replied
Peggotty
.
``
What
's
put
marriage
in
your
*NL*
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
with
such
a
start
,
that
it
quite
awoke
me
.
And
then
she
*NL*
stopped
in
her
work
,
and
looked
at
me
,
with
her
needle
drawn
out
to
its
*NL*
thread
's
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
_
were
_
you
ever
married
,
Peggotty
?
''
says
I.
``
You
are
a
very
*NL*
handsome
woman
,
a
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
her
in
a
different
style
from
my
mother
,
certainly
;
but
of
*NL*
another
school
of
beauty
,
I
considered
her
a
perfect
example
.
There
was
*NL*
a
red
velvet
footstool
in
the
best
parlor
,
on
which
my
mother
had
*NL*
painted
a
nosegay
.
The
ground-work
of
that
stool
,
and
Peggotty
's
*NL*
complexion
,
appeared
to
me
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
The
stool
was
*NL*
smooth
,
and
Peggotty
was
rough
,
but
that
made
no
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
handsome
,
Davy
!
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
Lawk
,
no
,
my
dear
!
But
what
put
*NL*
marriage
in
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
--
You
must
n't
marry
more
than
one
person
at
a
time
,
may
*NL*
you
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
says
Peggotty
,
with
the
promptest
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
marry
a
person
,
and
the
person
dies
,
why
then
you
may
marry
*NL*
another
person
,
may
n't
you
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
MAY
,
''
says
Peggotty
,
``
if
you
choose
,
my
dear
.
That
's
a
matter
of
*NL*
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
your
opinion
,
Peggotty
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
her
,
and
looked
curiously
at
her
,
because
she
looked
so
*NL*
curiously
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
opinion
is
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
taking
her
eyes
from
me
,
after
a
little
*NL*
indecision
and
going
on
with
her
work
,
``
that
I
never
was
married
myself
,
*NL*
Master
Davy
,
and
that
I
do
n't
expect
to
be
.
That
's
all
I
know
about
the
*NL*
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
a
n't
cross
,
I
suppose
,
Peggotty
,
are
you
?
''
said
I
,
after
sitting
*NL*
quiet
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
thought
she
was
,
she
had
been
so
short
with
me
;
but
I
was
quite
*NL*
mistaken
:
for
she
laid
aside
her
work
,
-LRB-
which
was
a
stocking
of
her
*NL*
own
,
-RRB-
and
opening
her
arms
wide
,
took
my
curly
head
within
them
,
and
*NL*
gave
it
a
good
squeeze
.
I
know
it
was
a
good
squeeze
,
because
,
being
*NL*
very
plump
,
whenever
she
made
any
little
exertion
after
she
was
dressed
,
*NL*
some
of
the
buttons
on
the
back
of
her
gown
flew
off
.
And
I
recollect
*NL*
two
bursting
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
parlor
,
while
she
was
hugging
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
me
hear
some
more
about
the
Crorkindills
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
who
*NL*
was
not
quite
right
in
the
name
yet
,
``
for
I
a
n't
heard
half
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
quite
understand
why
Peggotty
looked
so
queer
,
or
why
she
was
*NL*
so
ready
to
go
back
to
the
crocodiles
.
However
,
we
returned
to
those
*NL*
monsters
,
with
fresh
wakefulness
on
my
part
,
and
we
left
their
eggs
in
*NL*
the
sand
for
the
sun
to
hatch
;
and
we
ran
away
from
them
,
and
baffled
*NL*
them
by
constantly
turning
,
which
they
were
unable
to
do
quickly
,
on
*NL*
account
of
their
unwieldy
make
;
and
we
went
into
the
water
after
them
,
*NL*
as
natives
,
and
put
sharp
pieces
of
timber
down
their
throats
;
and
in
*NL*
short
we
ran
the
whole
crocodile
gauntlet
.
_
I
_
did
at
least
;
but
I
had
*NL*
my
doubts
of
Peggotty
,
who
was
thoughtfully
sticking
her
needle
into
*NL*
various
parts
of
her
face
and
arms
,
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
exhausted
the
crocodiles
,
and
begun
with
the
alligators
,
when
the
*NL*
garden-bell
rang
.
We
went
out
to
the
door
;
and
there
was
my
mother
,
*NL*
looking
unusually
pretty
,
I
thought
,
and
with
her
a
gentleman
with
*NL*
beautiful
black
hair
and
whiskers
,
who
had
walked
home
with
us
from
*NL*
church
last
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
mother
stooped
down
on
the
threshhold
to
take
me
in
her
arms
and
*NL*
kiss
me
,
the
gentleman
said
I
was
a
more
highly
privileged
little
fellow
*NL*
than
a
monarch
--
or
something
like
that
;
for
my
later
understanding
*NL*
comes
,
I
am
sensible
,
to
my
aid
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
mean
?
''
I
asked
him
,
over
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
patted
me
on
the
head
;
but
somehow
,
I
did
n't
like
him
or
his
deep
*NL*
voice
,
and
I
was
jealous
that
his
hand
should
touch
my
mother
's
in
*NL*
touching
me
--
which
it
did
.
I
put
it
away
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Davy
!
''
remonstrated
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
boy
!
''
said
the
gentleman
.
``
I
can
not
wonder
at
his
devotion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
color
on
my
mother
's
face
before
.
She
*NL*
gently
chid
me
for
being
rude
;
and
,
keeping
me
close
to
her
shawl
,
*NL*
turned
to
thank
the
gentleman
for
taking
so
much
trouble
as
to
bring
her
*NL*
home
.
She
put
out
her
hand
to
him
as
she
spoke
,
and
,
as
he
met
it
with
*NL*
his
own
,
she
glanced
,
I
thought
,
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
say
`
good
night
,
'
my
fine
boy
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
when
he
had
*NL*
bent
his
head
--
_
I
_
saw
him
!
--
over
my
mother
's
little
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Let
us
be
the
best
friends
in
the
world
!
''
said
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
laughing
.
``
Shake
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
right
hand
was
in
my
mother
's
left
,
so
I
gave
him
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
's
the
wrong
hand
,
Davy
!
''
laughed
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
drew
my
right
hand
forward
,
but
I
was
resolved
,
for
my
former
*NL*
reason
,
not
to
give
it
him
,
and
I
did
not
.
I
gave
him
the
other
,
and
he
*NL*
shook
it
heartily
,
and
said
I
was
a
brave
fellow
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
minute
I
see
him
turn
round
in
the
garden
,
and
give
us
a
last
*NL*
look
with
his
ill-omened
black
eyes
,
before
the
door
was
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
,
who
had
not
said
a
word
or
moved
a
finger
,
secured
the
*NL*
fastenings
instantly
,
and
we
all
went
into
the
parlor
.
My
mother
,
*NL*
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
,
instead
of
coming
to
the
elbow-chair
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
remained
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
sat
singing
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Hope
you
have
had
a
pleasant
evening
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
standing
*NL*
as
stiff
as
a
barrel
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
with
a
candlestick
in
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
obliged
to
you
,
Peggotty
,
''
returned
my
mother
,
in
a
cheerful
*NL*
voice
,
``
I
have
had
a
_
very
_
pleasant
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
stranger
or
so
makes
an
agreeable
change
,
''
suggested
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
agreeable
change
indeed
,
''
returned
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
continuing
to
stand
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
*NL*
my
mother
resuming
her
singing
,
I
fell
asleep
,
though
I
was
not
so
sound
*NL*
asleep
but
that
I
could
hear
voices
,
without
hearing
what
they
said
.
*NL*
When
I
half
awoke
from
this
uncomfortable
doze
,
I
found
Peggotty
and
my
*NL*
mother
both
in
tears
,
and
both
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
such
a
one
as
this
,
Mr.
Copperfield
would
n't
have
liked
,
''
said
*NL*
Peggotty
.
``
That
I
say
,
and
that
I
swear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heavens
!
''
cried
my
mother
.
``
You
'll
drive
me
mad
!
Was
ever
any
poor
*NL*
girl
so
ill-used
by
her
servants
as
I
am
!
Why
do
I
do
myself
the
*NL*
injustice
of
calling
myself
a
girl
?
Have
I
never
been
married
,
*NL*
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
you
have
,
ma'am
,
''
returned
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
can
you
dare
,
''
said
my
mother
--
``
you
know
I
do
n't
mean
how
can
*NL*
you
dare
,
Peggotty
,
but
how
can
you
have
the
heart
--
to
make
me
so
*NL*
uncomfortable
and
say
such
bitter
things
to
me
,
when
you
are
well
aware
*NL*
that
I
have
n't
,
out
of
this
place
,
a
single
friend
to
turn
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
's
the
reason
,
''
returned
Peggotty
,
``
for
saying
that
it
wo
n't
*NL*
do
.
No
!
That
it
wo
n't
do
.
No
!
No
price
could
make
it
do
.
No
!
''
--
I
thought
*NL*
Peggotty
would
have
thrown
the
candlestick
away
,
she
was
so
emphatic
*NL*
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
so
aggravating
,
''
said
my
mother
,
shedding
more
tears
*NL*
than
before
,
``
as
to
talk
in
such
an
unjust
manner
!
How
can
you
go
on
as
*NL*
if
it
was
all
settled
and
arranged
,
Peggotty
,
when
I
tell
you
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
you
cruel
thing
,
that
beyond
the
commonest
civilities
*NL*
nothing
has
passed
!
You
talk
of
admiration
.
What
am
I
to
do
?
If
people
*NL*
are
so
silly
as
to
indulge
the
sentiment
,
is
it
my
fault
?
What
am
I
to
*NL*
do
,
I
ask
you
?
Would
you
wish
me
to
shave
my
head
and
black
my
face
,
or
*NL*
disfigure
myself
with
a
burn
,
or
a
scald
,
or
something
of
that
sort
?
I
*NL*
dare
say
you
would
,
Peggotty
.
I
dare
say
you
'd
quite
enjoy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
seemed
to
take
this
aspersion
very
much
to
heart
,
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
dear
boy
,
''
cried
my
mother
,
coming
to
the
elbow-chair
in
which
I
*NL*
was
,
and
caressing
me
,
``
my
own
little
Davy
!
Is
it
to
be
hinted
to
me
*NL*
that
I
am
wanting
in
affection
for
my
precious
treasure
,
the
dearest
*NL*
little
fellow
that
ever
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
never
went
and
hinted
no
such
a
thing
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
Peggotty
!
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
You
know
you
did
.
What
else
*NL*
was
it
possible
to
infer
from
what
you
said
,
you
unkind
creature
,
when
*NL*
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
on
his
account
only
last
quarter
I
*NL*
would
n't
buy
myself
a
new
parasol
,
though
that
old
green
one
is
frayed
*NL*
the
whole
way
up
,
and
the
fringe
is
perfectly
mangy
.
You
know
it
is
,
*NL*
Peggotty
.
You
ca
n't
deny
it
.
''
Then
,
turning
affectionately
to
me
,
with
*NL*
her
cheek
against
mine
,
``
Am
I
a
naughty
mama
to
you
,
Davy
?
Am
I
a
nasty
,
*NL*
cruel
,
selfish
,
bad
mama
?
Say
I
am
,
my
child
;
say
`
yes
;
'
dear
boy
,
and
*NL*
Peggotty
will
love
you
,
and
Peggotty
's
love
is
a
great
deal
better
than
*NL*
mine
,
Davy
.
_
I
_
do
n't
love
you
at
all
,
do
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
we
all
fell
a-crying
together
.
I
think
I
was
the
loudest
of
*NL*
the
party
,
but
I
am
sure
we
were
all
sincere
about
it
.
I
was
quite
*NL*
heartbroken
myself
,
and
am
afraid
that
in
the
first
transports
of
*NL*
wounded
tenderness
I
called
Peggotty
a
``
Beast
.
''
That
honest
creature
*NL*
was
in
deep
affliction
,
I
remember
,
and
must
have
become
quite
*NL*
buttonless
on
the
occasion
;
for
a
little
volley
of
those
explosives
*NL*
went
off
,
when
,
after
having
made
it
up
with
my
mother
,
she
kneeled
*NL*
down
by
the
elbow-chair
,
and
made
it
up
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
to
bed
greatly
dejected
.
My
sobs
kept
waking
me
,
for
a
long
*NL*
time
;
and
when
one
very
strong
sob
quite
hoisted
me
up
in
bed
,
I
found
*NL*
my
mother
sitting
on
the
coverlet
,
and
leaning
over
me
.
I
fell
asleep
in
*NL*
her
arms
,
after
that
,
and
slept
soundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
the
following
Sunday
when
I
saw
the
gentleman
again
,
or
*NL*
whether
there
was
any
greater
lapse
of
time
before
he
reappeared
,
I
*NL*
can
not
recal
.
I
do
n't
profess
to
be
clear
about
dates
.
But
there
he
was
,
*NL*
in
church
,
and
he
walked
home
with
us
afterwards
.
He
came
in
,
too
,
to
*NL*
look
at
a
famous
geranium
we
had
,
in
the
parlor-window
.
It
did
not
*NL*
appear
to
me
that
he
took
much
notice
of
it
,
but
before
he
went
he
asked
*NL*
my
mother
to
give
him
a
bit
of
the
blossom
.
She
begged
him
to
choose
it
*NL*
for
himself
,
but
he
refused
to
do
that
--
I
could
not
understand
why
--
so
*NL*
she
plucked
it
for
him
,
and
gave
it
into
his
hand
.
He
said
he
would
*NL*
never
,
never
,
part
with
it
any
more
;
and
I
thought
he
must
be
quite
a
*NL*
fool
not
to
know
that
it
would
fall
to
pieces
in
a
day
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
began
to
be
less
with
us
,
of
an
evening
,
than
she
had
always
*NL*
been
.
My
mother
deferred
to
her
very
much
--
more
than
usual
,
it
occurred
*NL*
to
me
--
and
we
were
all
three
excellent
friends
;
still
we
were
different
*NL*
from
what
we
used
to
be
,
and
were
not
so
comfortable
among
ourselves
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
fancied
that
Peggotty
perhaps
objected
to
my
mother
's
*NL*
wearing
all
the
pretty
dresses
she
had
in
her
drawers
,
or
to
her
going
*NL*
so
often
to
visit
at
that
neighbour
's
;
but
I
could
n't
,
to
my
*NL*
satisfaction
,
make
out
how
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
,
I
became
used
to
seeing
the
gentleman
with
the
black
*NL*
whiskers
.
I
liked
him
no
better
than
at
first
,
and
had
the
same
uneasy
*NL*
jealousy
of
him
;
but
if
I
had
any
reason
for
it
beyond
a
child
's
*NL*
instinctive
dislike
,
and
a
general
idea
that
Peggotty
and
I
could
make
*NL*
much
of
my
mother
without
any
help
,
it
certainly
was
not
_
the
_
reason
*NL*
that
I
might
have
found
if
I
had
been
older
.
No
such
thing
came
into
my
*NL*
mind
,
or
near
it
.
I
could
observe
,
in
little
pieces
,
as
it
were
;
but
as
*NL*
to
making
a
net
of
a
number
of
these
pieces
,
and
catching
anybody
in
it
,
*NL*
that
was
,
as
yet
,
beyond
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
autumn
morning
I
was
with
my
mother
in
the
front
garden
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
--
I
knew
him
by
that
name
now
--
came
by
,
on
horseback
.
He
reined
*NL*
up
his
horse
to
salute
my
mother
,
and
said
he
was
going
to
Lowestoft
to
*NL*
see
some
friends
who
were
there
with
a
yacht
,
and
merrily
proposed
to
*NL*
take
me
on
the
saddle
before
him
if
I
would
like
the
ride
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
was
so
clear
and
pleasant
,
and
the
horse
seemed
to
like
the
idea
*NL*
of
the
ride
so
much
himself
,
as
he
stood
snorting
and
pawing
at
the
*NL*
garden-gate
,
that
I
had
a
great
desire
to
go
.
So
I
was
sent
up-stairs
to
*NL*
Peggotty
to
be
made
spruce
;
and
in
the
meantime
Mr.
Murdstone
*NL*
dismounted
,
and
,
with
his
horse
's
bridle
drawn
over
his
arm
,
walked
*NL*
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
outer
side
of
the
sweetbriar
fence
,
while
my
*NL*
mother
walked
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
inner
to
keep
him
company
.
I
*NL*
recollect
Peggotty
and
I
peeping
out
at
them
from
my
little
window
;
I
*NL*
recollect
how
closely
they
appeared
to
be
examining
the
sweetbriar
*NL*
between
them
,
as
they
strolled
along
;
and
how
,
from
being
in
a
perfectly
*NL*
angelic
temper
,
Peggotty
turned
cross
in
a
moment
,
and
brushed
my
hair
*NL*
the
wrong
way
,
excessively
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
and
I
were
soon
off
,
and
trotting
along
on
the
green
turf
*NL*
by
the
side
of
the
road
.
He
held
me
quite
easily
with
one
arm
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
was
restless
usually
;
but
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
*NL*
sit
in
front
of
him
without
turning
my
head
sometimes
,
and
looking
up
in
*NL*
his
face
.
He
had
that
kind
of
shallow
black
eye
--
I
want
a
better
word
to
*NL*
express
an
eye
that
has
no
depth
in
it
to
be
looked
into
--
which
,
when
it
*NL*
is
abstracted
,
seems
from
some
peculiarity
of
light
to
be
disfigured
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
at
a
time
,
by
a
cast
.
Several
times
when
I
glanced
at
him
,
*NL*
I
observed
that
appearance
with
a
sort
of
awe
,
and
wondered
what
he
was
*NL*
thinking
about
so
closely
.
His
hair
and
whiskers
were
blacker
and
*NL*
thicker
,
looked
at
so
near
,
than
even
I
had
given
them
credit
for
being
.
*NL*
A
squareness
about
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
and
the
dotted
indication
*NL*
of
the
strong
black
beard
he
shaved
close
every
day
,
reminded
me
of
the
*NL*
wax-work
that
had
travelled
into
our
neighbourhood
some
half-a-year
*NL*
before
.
This
,
his
regular
eyebrows
,
and
the
rich
white
,
and
black
,
and
*NL*
brown
,
of
his
complexion
--
confound
his
complexion
,
and
his
memory
!
--
made
*NL*
me
think
him
,
in
spite
of
my
misgivings
,
a
very
handsome
man
.
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
that
my
poor
dear
mother
thought
him
so
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
to
an
hotel
by
the
sea
,
where
two
gentlemen
were
smoking
cigars
*NL*
in
a
room
by
themselves
.
Each
of
them
was
lying
on
at
least
four
chairs
,
*NL*
and
had
a
large
rough
jacket
on
.
In
a
corner
was
a
heap
of
coats
and
*NL*
boat-cloaks
,
and
a
flag
,
all
bundled
up
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
rolled
on
to
their
feet
in
an
untidy
sort
of
manner
when
we
*NL*
came
in
,
and
said
``
Halloa
,
Murdstone
!
We
thought
you
were
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
's
this
shaver
?
''
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
taking
hold
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Davy
,
''
returned
Mr.
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davy
who
?
''
said
the
gentleman
.
``
Jones
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Bewitching
Mrs.
Copperfield
's
incumbrance
?
''
cried
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
``
The
pretty
little
widow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quinion
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
``
take
care
,
if
you
please
.
Somebody
's
*NL*
sharp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
?
''
asked
the
gentleman
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
up
,
quickly
;
being
curious
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
quite
relieved
to
find
it
was
only
Brooks
of
Sheffield
;
for
,
at
*NL*
first
,
I
really
thought
it
was
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
to
be
something
very
comical
in
the
reputation
of
Mr.
*NL*
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
for
both
the
gentlemen
laughed
heartily
when
he
was
*NL*
mentioned
,
and
Mr.
Murdstone
was
a
good
deal
amused
also
.
After
some
*NL*
laughing
,
the
gentleman
whom
he
had
called
Quinion
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
the
opinion
of
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
in
reference
to
the
*NL*
projected
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
that
Brooks
understands
much
about
it
at
present
,
''
*NL*
replied
Mr.
Murdstone
;
``
but
he
is
not
generally
favourable
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
laughter
at
this
,
and
Mr.
Quinion
said
he
would
ring
the
*NL*
bell
for
some
sherry
in
which
to
drink
to
Brooks
.
This
he
did
;
and
when
*NL*
the
wine
came
,
he
made
me
have
a
little
,
with
a
biscuit
,
and
,
before
I
*NL*
drank
it
,
stand
up
and
say
``
Confusion
to
Brooks
of
Sheffield
!
''
The
toast
*NL*
was
received
with
great
applause
,
and
such
hearty
laughter
that
it
made
*NL*
me
laugh
too
;
at
which
they
laughed
the
more
.
In
short
,
we
quite
enjoyed
*NL*
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
about
on
the
cliff
after
that
,
and
sat
on
the
grass
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
things
through
a
telescope
--
I
could
make
out
nothing
myself
*NL*
when
it
was
put
to
my
eye
,
but
I
pretended
I
could
--
and
then
we
came
*NL*
back
to
the
hotel
to
an
early
dinner
.
All
the
time
we
were
out
,
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
smoked
incessantly
--
which
,
I
thought
,
if
I
might
judge
from
*NL*
the
smell
of
their
rough
coats
,
they
must
have
been
doing
,
ever
since
*NL*
the
coats
had
first
come
home
from
the
tailor
's
.
I
must
not
forget
that
*NL*
we
went
on
board
the
yacht
,
where
they
all
three
descended
into
the
*NL*
cabin
,
and
were
busy
with
some
papers
.
I
saw
them
quite
hard
at
work
,
*NL*
when
I
looked
down
through
the
open
skylight
.
They
left
me
,
during
this
*NL*
time
,
with
a
very
nice
man
with
a
very
large
head
of
red
hair
and
a
very
*NL*
small
shiny
hat
upon
it
,
who
had
got
a
cross-barred
shirt
or
waistcoat
*NL*
on
,
with
``
Skylark
''
in
capital
letters
across
the
chest
.
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
his
name
;
and
that
as
he
lived
on
board
ship
and
had
n't
a
street-door
to
*NL*
put
his
name
on
,
he
put
it
there
instead
;
but
when
I
called
him
Mr.
*NL*
Skylark
,
he
said
it
meant
the
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
observed
all
day
that
Mr.
Murdstone
was
graver
and
steadier
than
the
*NL*
two
gentlemen
.
They
were
very
gay
and
careless
.
They
joked
freely
with
*NL*
one
another
,
but
seldom
with
him
.
It
appeared
to
me
that
he
was
more
*NL*
clever
and
cold
than
they
were
,
and
that
they
regarded
him
with
*NL*
something
of
my
own
feeling
.
I
remarked
that
once
or
twice
when
Mr.
*NL*
Quinion
was
talking
,
he
looked
at
Mr.
Murdstone
sideways
,
as
if
to
make
*NL*
sure
of
his
not
being
displeased
;
and
that
once
when
Mr.
Passnidge
-LRB-
the
*NL*
other
gentleman
-RRB-
was
in
high
spirits
,
he
trod
upon
his
foot
,
and
gave
*NL*
him
a
secret
caution
with
his
eyes
,
to
observe
Mr.
Murdstone
,
who
was
*NL*
sitting
stern
and
silent
.
Nor
do
I
recollect
that
Mr.
Murdstone
laughed
*NL*
at
all
that
day
,
except
at
the
Sheffield
joke
--
and
that
,
by
the
by
,
was
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
home
early
in
the
evening
.
It
was
a
very
fine
evening
,
and
my
*NL*
mother
and
he
had
another
stroll
by
the
sweet-briar
,
while
I
was
sent
in
*NL*
to
get
my
tea
.
When
he
was
gone
,
my
mother
asked
me
all
about
the
day
I
*NL*
had
had
,
and
what
they
had
said
and
done
.
I
mentioned
what
they
had
said
*NL*
about
her
,
and
she
laughed
,
and
told
me
they
were
impudent
fellows
who
*NL*
talked
nonsense
--
but
I
knew
it
pleased
her
.
I
knew
it
quite
as
well
as
I
*NL*
know
it
now
.
I
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
if
she
was
at
all
*NL*
acquainted
with
Mr.
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
but
she
answered
No
,
only
she
*NL*
supposed
he
must
be
a
manufacturer
in
the
knife
and
fork
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Can
I
say
of
her
face
--
altered
as
I
have
reason
to
remember
it
,
perished
*NL*
as
I
know
it
is
--
that
it
is
gone
,
when
here
it
comes
before
me
at
this
*NL*
instant
,
as
distinct
as
any
face
that
I
may
choose
to
look
on
in
a
*NL*
crowded
street
?
Can
I
say
of
her
innocent
and
girlish
beauty
,
that
it
*NL*
faded
,
and
was
no
more
,
when
its
breath
falls
on
my
cheek
now
,
as
it
*NL*
fell
that
night
?
Can
I
say
she
ever
changed
,
when
my
remembrance
brings
*NL*
her
back
to
life
,
thus
only
;
and
,
truer
to
its
loving
youth
than
I
have
*NL*
been
,
or
man
ever
is
,
still
holds
fast
what
it
cherished
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
write
of
her
just
as
she
was
when
I
had
gone
to
bed
after
this
talk
,
*NL*
and
she
came
to
bid
me
good
night
.
She
kneeled
down
playfully
by
the
*NL*
side
of
the
bed
,
and
laying
her
chin
upon
her
hands
,
and
laughing
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
they
said
,
Davy
?
Tell
me
again
.
I
ca
n't
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Bewitching
--
'
''
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
put
her
hands
upon
her
lips
to
stop
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
never
bewitching
,
''
she
said
,
laughing
.
``
It
never
could
have
been
*NL*
bewitching
,
Davy
.
Now
I
know
it
was
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
was
.
`
Bewitching

Copperfield
,
'
''
I
repeated
stoutly
.
``
And
*NL*
`
pretty
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
no
,
it
was
never
pretty
.
Not
pretty
,
''
interposed
my
mother
,
laying
*NL*
her
fingers
on
my
lips
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
was
.
`
Pretty
little
widow
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
foolish
,
impudent
creatures
!
''
cried
my
mother
,
laughing
and
*NL*
covering
her
face
.
``
What
ridiculous
men
!
A
n't
they
?
Davy
dear

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Ma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
Peggotty
;
she
might
be
angry
with

I
am
dreadfully
*NL*
angry
with
them
myself
;
but
I
would
rather
Peggotty
did
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
promised
,
of
course
;
and
we
kissed
one
another
over
and
over
again
,
*NL*
and
I
soon
fell
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
to
me
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
as
if
it
were
the
next
day
*NL*
when
Peggotty
broached
the
striking
and
adventurous
proposition
I
am
*NL*
about
to
mention
;
but
it
was
probably
about
two
months
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
sitting
as
before
,
one
evening
-LRB-
when
my
mother
was
out
as
*NL*
before
-RRB-
,
in
company
with
the
stocking
and
the
yard
measure
,
and
the
bit
*NL*
of
wax
,
and
the
box
with
Saint
Paul
's
on
the
lid
,
and
the
crocodile
*NL*
book
,
when
Peggotty
,
after
looking
at
me
several
times
,
and
opening
her
*NL*
mouth
as
if
she
were
going
to
speak
,
without
doing
it
--
which
I
thought
*NL*
was
merely
gaping
,
or
I
should
have
been
rather
alarmed
--
said
coaxingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Davy
,
how
should
you
like
to
go
along
with
me
and
spend
a
*NL*
fortnight
at
my
brother
's
at
Yarmouth
?
Would
n't
_
that
_
be
a
treat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
brother
an
agreeable
man
,
Peggotty
?
''
I
enquired
,
provisionally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
what
an
agreeable
man
he
is
!
''
cried
Peggotty
,
holding
up
her
hands
.
*NL*
``
Then
there
's
the
sea
;
and
the
boats
and
ships
;
and
the
fishermen
;
and
*NL*
the
beach
;
and
Am
to
play
with
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
meant
her
nephew
Ham
,
mentioned
in
my
first
chapter
;
but
she
*NL*
spoke
of
him
as
a
morsel
of
English
Grammar
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
flushed
by
her
summary
of
delights
,
and
replied
that
it
would
*NL*
indeed
be
a
treat
,
but
what
would
my
mother
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
I
'll
as
good
as
bet
a
guinea
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
intent
upon
my
*NL*
face
,
``
that
she
'll
let
us
go
.
I
'll
ask
her
,
if
you
like
,
as
soon
as
ever
*NL*
she
comes
home
.
There
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
's
she
to
do
while
we
're
away
?
''
said
I
,
putting
my
small
elbows
*NL*
on
the
table
to
argue
the
point
.
``
She
ca
n't
live
by
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Peggotty
were
looking
for
a
hole
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
in
the
heel
of
*NL*
that
stocking
,
it
must
have
been
a
very
little
one
indeed
,
and
not
worth
*NL*
darning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
Peggotty
!
She
ca
n't
live
by
herself
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
bless
you
!
''
said
Peggotty
,
looking
at
me
again
at
last
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
know
?
She
's
going
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
with
Mrs.
Grayper
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Grayper
's
going
to
have
a
lot
of
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
If
that
was
it
,
I
was
quite
ready
to
go
.
I
waited
,
in
the
utmost
*NL*
impatience
,
until
my
mother
came
home
from
Mrs.
Grayper
's
-LRB-
for
it
was
*NL*
that
identical
neighbour
-RRB-
,
to
ascertain
if
we
could
get
leave
to
carry
*NL*
out
this
great
idea
.
Without
being
nearly
so
much
surprised
as
I
had
*NL*
expected
,
my
mother
entered
into
it
readily
;
and
it
was
all
arranged
*NL*
that
night
,
and
my
board
and
lodging
during
the
visit
were
to
be
paid
*NL*
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
soon
came
for
our
going
.
It
was
such
an
early
day
that
it
came
*NL*
soon
,
even
to
me
,
who
was
in
a
fever
of
expectation
,
and
half
afraid
*NL*
that
an
earthquake
or
a
fiery
mountain
,
or
some
other
great
convulsion
*NL*
of
nature
,
might
interpose
to
stop
the
expedition
.
We
were
to
go
in
a
*NL*
carrier
's
cart
,
which
departed
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
.
I
would
*NL*
have
given
any
money
to
have
been
allowed
to
wrap
myself
up
over-night
,
*NL*
and
sleep
in
my
hat
and
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
touches
me
nearly
now
,
although
I
tell
it
lightly
,
to
recollect
how
*NL*
eager
I
was
to
leave
my
happy
home
;
to
think
how
little
I
suspected
what
*NL*
I
did
leave
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
's
cart
was
at
the
gate
,
and
*NL*
my
mother
stood
there
kissing
me
,
a
grateful
fondness
for
her
and
for
*NL*
the
old
place
I
had
never
turned
my
back
upon
before
,
made
me
cry
.
I
am
*NL*
glad
to
know
that
my
mother
cried
too
,
and
that
I
felt
her
heart
beat
*NL*
against
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
began
to
move
,
my
mother
*NL*
ran
out
at
the
gate
,
and
called
to
him
to
stop
,
that
she
might
kiss
me
*NL*
once
more
.
I
am
glad
to
dwell
upon
the
earnestness
and
love
with
which
*NL*
she
lifted
up
her
face
to
mine
,
and
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
left
her
standing
in
the
road
,
Mr.
Murdstone
came
up
to
where
she
*NL*
was
,
and
seemed
to
expostulate
with
her
for
being
so
moved
.
I
was
*NL*
looking
back
round
the
awning
of
the
cart
,
and
wondered
what
business
it
*NL*
was
of
his
.
Peggotty
,
who
was
also
looking
back
on
the
other
side
,
*NL*
seemed
anything
but
satisfied
;
as
the
face
she
brought
back
into
the
*NL*
cart
denoted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
looking
at
Peggotty
for
some
time
,
in
a
reverie
on
this
*NL*
supposititious
case
:
whether
,
if
she
were
employed
to
lose
me
like
the
*NL*
boy
in
the
fairy
tale
,
I
should
be
able
to
track
my
way
home
again
by
*NL*
the
buttons
she
would
shed
.

CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
HAVE
A
CHANGE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
carrier
's
horse
was
the
laziest
horse
in
the
world
,
I
should
hope
,
*NL*
and
shuffled
along
,
with
his
head
down
,
as
if
he
liked
to
keep
the
*NL*
people
waiting
to
whom
the
packages
were
directed
.
I
fancied
,
indeed
,
*NL*
that
he
sometimes
chuckled
audibly
over
this
reflection
,
but
the
carrier
*NL*
said
he
was
only
troubled
with
a
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carrier
had
a
way
of
keeping
his
head
down
,
like
his
horse
,
and
of
*NL*
drooping
sleepily
forward
as
he
drove
,
with
one
of
his
arms
on
each
of
*NL*
his
knees
.
I
say
``
drove
,
''
but
it
struck
me
that
the
cart
would
have
gone
*NL*
to
Yarmouth
quite
as
well
without
him
,
for
the
horse
did
all
that
;
and
*NL*
as
to
conversation
,
he
had
no
idea
of
it
but
whistling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
had
a
basket
of
refreshments
on
her
knee
,
which
would
have
*NL*
lasted
us
out
handsomely
,
if
we
had
been
going
to
London
by
the
same
*NL*
conveyance
.
We
ate
a
good
deal
,
and
slept
a
good
deal
.
Peggotty
always
*NL*
went
to
sleep
with
her
chin
upon
the
handle
of
the
basket
,
her
hold
of
*NL*
which
never
relaxed
;
and
I
could
not
have
believed
unless
I
had
heard
*NL*
her
do
it
,
that
one
defenceless
woman
could
have
snored
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
so
many
deviations
up
and
down
lanes
,
and
were
such
a
long
time
*NL*
delivering
a
bedstead
at
a
public-house
,
and
calling
at
other
places
,
*NL*
that
I
was
quite
tired
,
and
very
glad
,
when
we
saw
Yarmouth
.
It
looked
*NL*
rather
spongy
and
soppy
,
I
thought
,
as
I
carried
my
eye
over
the
great
*NL*
dull
waste
that
lay
across
the
river
;
and
I
could
not
help
wondering
,
if
*NL*
the
world
were
really
as
round
as
my
geography-book
said
,
how
any
part
*NL*
of
it
came
to
be
so
flat
.
But
I
reflected
that
Yarmouth
might
be
*NL*
situated
at
one
of
the
poles
;
which
would
account
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
drew
a
little
nearer
,
and
saw
the
whole
adjacent
prospect
lying
a
*NL*
straight
low
line
under
the
sky
,
I
hinted
to
Peggotty
that
a
mound
or
so
*NL*
might
have
improved
it
;
and
also
that
if
the
land
had
been
a
little
more
*NL*
separated
from
the
sea
,
and
the
town
and
the
tide
had
not
been
quite
so
*NL*
much
mixed
up
,
like
toast
and
water
,
it
would
have
been
nicer
.
But
*NL*
Peggotty
said
,
with
greater
emphasis
than
usual
,
that
we
must
take
*NL*
things
as
we
found
them
,
and
that
,
for
her
part
,
she
was
proud
to
call
*NL*
herself
a
Yarmouth
Bloater
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
into
the
street
-LRB-
which
was
strange
enough
to
me
-RRB-
,
and
smelt
*NL*
the
fish
,
and
pitch
,
and
oakum
,
and
tar
,
and
saw
the
sailors
walking
*NL*
about
,
and
the
carts
jingling
up
and
down
over
the
stones
,
I
felt
that
I
*NL*
had
done
so
busy
a
place
an
injustice
;
and
said
as
much
to
Peggotty
,
who
*NL*
heard
my
expressions
of
delight
with
great
complacency
,
and
told
me
it
*NL*
was
well
known
-LRB-
I
suppose
to
those
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
born
*NL*
Bloaters
-RRB-
that
Yarmouth
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
finest
place
in
the
*NL*
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
my
Am
!
''
screamed
Peggotty
,
``
growed
out
of
knowledge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
waiting
for
us
,
in
fact
,
at
the
public-house
;
and
asked
me
how
I
*NL*
found
myself
,
like
an
old
acquaintance
.
I
did
not
feel
,
at
first
,
that
I
*NL*
knew
him
as
well
as
he
knew
me
,
because
he
had
never
come
to
our
house
*NL*
since
the
night
I
was
born
,
and
naturally
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
.
*NL*
But
our
intimacy
was
much
advanced
by
his
taking
me
on
his
back
to
carry
*NL*
me
home
.
He
was
,
now
,
a
huge
,
strong
fellow
of
six
feet
high
,
broad
in
*NL*
proportion
,
and
round-shouldered
;
but
with
a
simpering
boy
's
face
and
*NL*
curly
light
hair
that
gave
him
quite
a
sheepish
look
.
He
was
dressed
in
*NL*
a
canvas
jacket
,
and
a
pair
of
such
very
stiff
trousers
that
they
would
*NL*
have
stood
quite
as
well
alone
,
without
any
legs
in
them
.
And
you
*NL*
could
n't
so
properly
have
said
he
wore
a
hat
,
as
that
he
was
covered
in
*NL*
a-top
,
like
an
old
building
,
with
something
pitchy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
carrying
me
on
his
back
and
a
small
box
of
ours
under
his
arm
,
*NL*
and
Peggotty
carrying
another
small
box
of
ours
,
we
turned
down
lanes
*NL*
bestrewn
with
bits
of
chips
and
little
hillocks
of
sand
,
and
went
past
*NL*
gas-works
,
rope-walks
,
boat-builders
'
yards
,
ship-wrights
'
yards
,
*NL*
ship-breakers
'
yards
,
caulkers
'
yards
,
riggers
'
lofts
,
smiths
'
forges
,
*NL*
and
a
great
litter
of
such
places
,
until
we
came
out
upon
the
dull
*NL*
waste
I
had
already
seen
at
a
distance
;
when
Ham
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yon
's
our
house
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
in
all
directions
,
as
far
as
I
could
stare
over
the
wilderness
,
*NL*
and
away
at
the
sea
,
and
away
at
the
river
,
but
no
house
could
_
I
_
make
*NL*
out
.
There
was
a
black
barge
,
or
some
other
kind
of
superannuated
boat
,
*NL*
not
far
off
,
high
and
dry
on
the
ground
,
with
an
iron
funnel
sticking
*NL*
out
of
it
for
a
chimney
and
smoking
very
cosily
;
but
nothing
else
in
the
*NL*
way
of
a
habitation
that
was
visible
to
_
me
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
it
?
''
said
I.
``
That
ship-looking
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
returned
Ham
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
been
Aladdin
's
palace
,
roc
's
egg
and
all
,
I
suppose
I
could
*NL*
not
have
been
more
charmed
with
the
romantic
idea
of
living
in
it
.
There
*NL*
was
a
delightful
door
cut
in
the
side
,
and
it
was
roofed
in
,
and
there
*NL*
were
little
windows
in
it
;
but
the
wonderful
charm
of
it
was
,
that
it
*NL*
was
a
real
boat
which
had
no
doubt
been
upon
the
water
hundreds
of
*NL*
times
,
and
which
had
never
been
intended
to
be
lived
in
,
on
dry
land
.
*NL*
That
was
the
captivation
of
it
to
me
.
If
it
had
ever
been
meant
to
be
*NL*
lived
in
,
I
might
have
thought
it
small
,
or
inconvenient
,
or
lonely
;
but
*NL*
never
having
been
designed
for
any
such
use
,
it
became
a
perfect
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
beautifully
clean
inside
,
and
as
tidy
as
possible
.
There
was
a
*NL*
table
,
and
a
Dutch
clock
,
and
a
chest
of
drawers
,
and
on
the
chest
of
*NL*
drawers
there
was
a
tea-tray
with
a
painting
on
it
of
a
lady
with
a
*NL*
parasol
,
taking
a
walk
with
a
military-looking
child
who
was
trundling
a
*NL*
hoop
.
The
tray
was
kept
from
tumbling
down
,
by
a
bible
;
and
the
tray
,
if
*NL*
it
had
tumbled
down
,
would
have
smashed
a
quantity
of
cups
and
saucers
*NL*
and
a
teapot
that
were
grouped
around
the
book
.
On
the
walls
there
were
*NL*
some
common
colored
pictures
,
framed
and
glazed
,
of
scripture
subjects
;
*NL*
such
as
I
have
never
seen
since
in
the
hands
of
pedlars
,
without
seeing
*NL*
the
whole
interior
of
Peggotty
's
brother
's
house
again
,
at
one
view
.
*NL*
Abraham
in
red
going
to
sacrifice
Isaac
in
blue
,
and
Daniel
in
yellow
*NL*
cast
into
a
den
of
green
lions
,
were
the
most
prominent
of
these
.
Over
*NL*
the
little
mantel-shelf
,
was
a
picture
of
the
Sarah
Jane
lugger
,
built
*NL*
at
Sunderland
,
with
a
real
little
wooden
stern
stuck
on
to
it
;
a
work
of
*NL*
art
,
combining
composition
with
carpentery
,
which
I
considered
to
be
one
*NL*
of
the
most
enviable
possessions
that
the
world
could
afford
.
There
were
*NL*
some
hooks
in
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
,
the
use
of
which
I
did
not
*NL*
divine
then
;
and
some
lockers
and
boxes
and
conveniences
of
that
sort
,
*NL*
which
served
for
seats
and
eked
out
the
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
I
saw
in
the
first
glance
after
I
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
--
childlike
,
according
to
my
theory
--
and
then
Peggotty
*NL*
opened
a
little
door
and
showed
me
my
bedroom
.
It
was
the
completest
*NL*
and
most
desirable
bedroom
ever
seen
--
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
;
*NL*
with
a
little
window
,
where
the
rudder
used
to
go
through
;
a
little
*NL*
looking-glass
,
just
the
right
height
for
me
,
nailed
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
framed
with
oyster-shells
;
a
little
bed
,
which
there
was
just
room
*NL*
enough
to
get
into
;
and
a
nosegay
of
seaweed
in
a
blue
mug
on
the
*NL*
table
.
The
walls
were
whitewashed
as
white
as
milk
,
and
the
patchwork
*NL*
counterpane
made
my
eyes
quite
ache
with
its
brightness
.
One
thing
I
*NL*
particularly
noticed
in
this
delightful
house
,
was
the
smell
of
fish
;
*NL*
which
was
so
searching
,
that
when
I
took
out
my
pocket-handkerchief
*NL*
to
wipe
my
nose
,
I
found
it
smelt
exactly
as
if
it
had
wrapped
up
a
*NL*
lobster
.
On
my
imparting
this
discovery
in
confidence
to
Peggotty
,
she
*NL*
informed
me
that
her
brother
dealt
in
lobsters
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
;
*NL*
and
I
afterwards
found
that
a
heap
of
these
creatures
,
in
a
state
*NL*
of
wonderful
conglomeration
with
one
another
,
and
never
leaving
off
*NL*
pinching
whatever
they
laid
hold
of
,
were
usually
to
be
found
in
a
*NL*
little
wooden
outhouse
where
the
pots
and
kettles
were
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
welcomed
by
a
very
civil
woman
in
a
white
apron
,
whom
I
had
seen
*NL*
curtseying
at
the
door
when
I
was
on
Ham
's
back
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
off
.
Likewise
by
a
most
beautiful
little
girl
-LRB-
or
I
thought
her
so
-RRB-
*NL*
with
a
necklace
of
blue
beads
on
,
who
would
n't
let
me
kiss
her
when
I
*NL*
offered
to
,
but
ran
away
and
hid
herself
.
By
and
by
,
when
we
had
dined
*NL*
in
a
sumptuous
manner
off
boiled
dabs
,
melted
butter
,
and
potatoes
,
with
*NL*
a
chop
for
me
,
a
hairy
man
with
a
very
good-natured
face
came
home
.
As
*NL*
he
called
Peggotty
``
Lass
,
''
and
gave
her
a
hearty
smack
on
the
cheek
,
I
*NL*
had
no
doubt
,
from
the
general
propriety
of
her
conduct
,
that
he
was
her
*NL*
brother
;
and
so
he
turned
out
--
being
presently
introduced
to
me
as
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
,
the
master
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
see
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
You
'll
find
us
rough
,
sir
,
*NL*
but
you
'll
find
us
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
I
am
hospitably
received
by
Mr.
Peggotty
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
,
and
replied
that
I
was
sure
I
should
be
happy
in
such
a
*NL*
delightful
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
your
Ma
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
Did
you
leave
her
pretty
*NL*
jolly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
Mr.
Peggotty
to
understand
that
she
was
as
jolly
as
I
could
wish
,
*NL*
and
that
she
desired
her
compliments
--
which
was
a
polite
fiction
on
my
*NL*
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
much
obleeged
to
her
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
Well
sir
,
if
*NL*
you
can
make
out
here
,
fur
a
fortnut
,
`
long
wi
'
her
,
''
nodding
at
his
*NL*
sister
,
``
and
Ham
,
and
little
Em
`
ly
,
we
shall
be
proud
of
your
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
done
the
honors
of
his
house
in
this
hospitable
manner
,
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
went
out
to
wash
himself
in
a
kettleful
of
hot
water
,
*NL*
remarking
that
``
cold
would
never
get
_
his
_
muck
off
.
''
He
soon
returned
,
*NL*
greatly
improved
in
appearance
;
but
so
rubicund
,
that
I
could
n't
help
*NL*
thinking
his
face
had
this
in
common
with
the
lobsters
,
crabs
,
and
*NL*
crawfish
,
--
that
it
went
into
the
hot
water
very
black
,
and
came
out
*NL*
very
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
when
the
door
was
shut
and
all
was
made
snug
-LRB-
the
nights
*NL*
being
cold
and
misty
now
-RRB-
,
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
delicious
retreat
*NL*
that
the
imagination
of
man
could
conceive
.
To
hear
the
wind
getting
up
*NL*
out
at
sea
,
to
know
that
the
fog
was
creeping
over
the
desolate
flat
*NL*
outside
,
and
to
look
at
the
fire
,
and
think
that
there
was
no
house
near
*NL*
but
this
one
,
and
this
one
a
boat
,
was
like
enchantment
.
Little
Em
`
ly
*NL*
had
overcome
her
shyness
,
and
was
sitting
by
my
side
upon
the
lowest
and
*NL*
least
of
the
lockers
,
which
was
just
large
enough
for
us
two
,
and
just
*NL*
fitted
into
the
chimney
corner
.
Mrs.
Peggotty
with
the
white
apron
,
was
*NL*
knitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
.
Peggotty
at
her
needle-work
*NL*
was
as
much
at
home
with
Saint
Paul
's
and
the
bit
of
wax-candle
,
as
if
*NL*
they
had
never
known
any
other
roof
.
Ham
,
who
had
been
giving
me
my
*NL*
first
lesson
in
all-fours
,
was
trying
to
recollect
a
scheme
of
telling
*NL*
fortunes
with
the
dirty
cards
,
and
was
printing
off
fishy
impressions
of
*NL*
his
thumb
on
all
the
cards
he
turned
.
Mr.
Peggotty
was
smoking
his
pipe
.
*NL*
I
felt
it
was
a
time
for
conversation
and
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Peggotty
!
''
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
give
your
son
the
name
of
Ham
,
because
you
lived
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
ark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
seemed
to
think
it
a
deep
idea
,
but
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
I
never
giv
him
no
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
him
that
name
,
then
?
''
said
I
,
putting
question
number
two
of
*NL*
the
catechism
to
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
his
father
giv
it
him
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
his
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
Joe
was
_
his
_
father
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
I
hinted
,
after
a
respectful
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drowndead
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
surprised
that
Mr.
Peggotty
was
not
Ham
's
father
,
and
*NL*
began
to
wonder
whether
I
was
mistaken
about
his
relationship
to
anybody
*NL*
else
there
.
I
was
so
curious
to
know
,
that
I
made
up
my
mind
to
have
it
*NL*
out
with
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Em
`
ly
,
''
I
said
,
glancing
at
her
.
``
She
is
your
daughter
,
is
n't
*NL*
she
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
My
brother
in
law
,
Tom
,
was
_
her
_
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
help
it
.
''
--
Dead
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
I
hinted
,
after
another
*NL*
respectful
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drowndead
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
difficulty
of
resuming
the
subject
,
but
had
not
got
to
the
*NL*
bottom
of
it
yet
,
and
must
get
to
the
bottom
somehow
.
So
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
_
any
_
children
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
master
,
''
he
answered
with
a
short
laugh
.
``
I
'm
a
bacheldore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bachelor
!
''
I
said
,
astonished
.
``
Why
,
who
's
that
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
pointing
to
the
person
in
the
apron
who
was
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Missis
Gummidge
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gummidge
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
point
Peggotty
--
I
mean
my
own
peculiar
Peggotty
--
made
such
*NL*
impressive
motions
to
me
not
to
ask
any
more
questions
,
that
I
could
*NL*
only
sit
and
look
at
all
the
silent
company
,
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
Then
,
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
little
cabin
,
she
informed
me
that
*NL*
Ham
and
Em
`
ly
were
an
orphan
nephew
and
niece
,
whom
my
host
had
at
*NL*
different
times
adopted
in
their
childhood
,
when
they
were
left
*NL*
destitute
;
and
that
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
the
widow
of
his
partner
in
a
*NL*
boat
,
who
had
died
very
poor
.
He
was
but
a
poor
man
himself
,
said
*NL*
Peggotty
,
but
as
good
as
gold
and
as
true
as
steel
--
those
were
her
*NL*
similies
.
The
only
subject
,
she
informed
me
,
on
which
he
ever
showed
a
*NL*
violent
temper
or
swore
an
oath
,
was
this
generosity
of
his
;
and
if
it
*NL*
were
ever
referred
to
,
by
any
one
of
them
,
he
struck
the
table
a
heavy
*NL*
blow
with
his
right
hand
-LRB-
had
split
it
on
one
such
occasion
-RRB-
,
and
swore
*NL*
a
dreadful
oath
that
he
would
be
`
Gormed
'
if
he
did
n't
cut
and
run
for
*NL*
good
,
if
it
was
ever
mentioned
again
.
It
appeared
,
in
answer
to
my
*NL*
inquiries
,
that
nobody
had
the
least
idea
of
the
etymology
of
this
*NL*
terrible
verb
passive
to
be
gormed
;
but
that
they
all
regarded
it
as
*NL*
constituting
a
most
solemn
imprecation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
sensible
of
my
entertainer
's
goodness
,
and
listened
to
the
*NL*
women
's
going
to
bed
in
another
little
crib
like
mine
at
the
opposite
*NL*
end
of
the
boat
,
and
to
him
and
Ham
hanging
up
two
hammocks
for
*NL*
themselves
on
the
hooks
I
had
noticed
in
the
roof
,
in
a
very
luxurious
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
enhanced
by
my
being
sleepy
.
As
slumber
gradually
stole
*NL*
upon
me
,
I
heard
the
wind
howling
out
at
sea
and
coming
on
across
the
*NL*
flat
so
fiercely
,
that
I
had
a
lazy
apprehension
of
the
great
deep
*NL*
rising
in
the
night
.
But
I
bethought
myself
that
I
was
in
a
boat
,
after
*NL*
all
;
and
that
a
man
like
Mr.
Peggotty
was
not
a
bad
person
to
have
on
*NL*
board
if
anything
did
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
happened
,
however
,
worse
than
morning
.
Almost
as
soon
as
it
*NL*
shone
upon
the
oyster-shell
frame
of
my
mirror
I
was
out
of
bed
,
and
out
*NL*
with
little
Em
`
ly
,
picking
up
stones
upon
the
beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
quite
a
sailor
,
I
suppose
?
''
I
said
to
Em
`
ly
.
I
do
n't
know
that
I
*NL*
supposed
any
thing
of
the
kind
,
but
I
felt
it
an
act
of
gallantry
to
say
*NL*
something
;
and
a
shining
sail
close
to
us
made
such
a
pretty
little
*NL*
image
of
itself
,
at
the
moment
,
in
her
bright
eye
,
that
it
came
into
my
*NL*
head
to
say
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Em
`
ly
,
shaking
her
head
,
``
I
'm
afraid
of
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
!
''
I
said
,
with
a
becoming
air
of
boldness
,
and
looking
very
big
*NL*
at
the
mighty
ocean
.
''
_
I
_
a
`
nt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
it
's
cruel
,
''
said
Em
`
ly
.
``
I
have
seen
it
very
cruel
to
some
of
*NL*
our
men
.
I
have
seen
it
tear
a
boat
as
big
as
our
house
,
all
to
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
was
n't
the
boat
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
father
was
drownded
in
?
''
said
Em
`
ly
.
``
No
.
Not
that
one
,
I
never
*NL*
see
that
boat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
him
?
''
I
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Em
`
ly
shook
her
head
.
``
Not
to
remember
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
coincidence
!
I
immediately
went
into
an
explanation
how
I
had
*NL*
never
seen
my
own
father
;
and
how
my
mother
and
I
had
always
lived
by
*NL*
ourselves
in
the
happiest
state
imaginable
,
and
lived
so
then
,
and
*NL*
always
meant
to
live
so
;
and
how
my
father
's
grave
was
in
the
churchyard
*NL*
near
our
house
,
and
shaded
by
a
tree
,
beneath
the
boughs
of
which
I
had
*NL*
walked
and
heard
the
birds
sing
many
a
pleasant
morning
.
But
there
were
*NL*
some
differences
between
Em
`
ly
's
orphanhood
and
mine
,
it
appeared
.
She
*NL*
had
lost
her
mother
before
her
father
;
and
where
her
father
's
grave
was
*NL*
no
one
knew
,
except
that
it
was
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Em
`
ly
,
as
she
looked
about
for
shells
and
pebbles
,
``
your
*NL*
father
was
a
gentleman
and
your
mother
is
a
lady
;
and
my
father
was
a
*NL*
fisherman
and
my
mother
was
a
fisherman
's
daughter
,
and
my
uncle
Dan
is
*NL*
a
fisherman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dan
is
Mr.
Peggotty
,
is
he
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Dan
--
yonder
,
''
answered
Em
`
ly
,
nodding
at
the
boat-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
mean
him
.
He
must
be
very
good
,
I
should
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
?
''
said
Em
`
ly
.
``
If
I
was
ever
to
be
a
lady
,
I
'd
give
him
a
sky-blue
*NL*
coat
with
diamond
buttons
,
nankeen
trousers
,
a
red
velvet
waistcoat
,
a
*NL*
cocked
hat
,
a
large
gold
watch
,
a
silver
pipe
,
and
a
box
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
had
no
doubt
that
Mr.
Peggotty
well
deserved
these
treasures
.
I
*NL*
must
acknowledge
that
I
felt
it
difficult
to
picture
him
quite
at
his
*NL*
ease
in
the
raiment
proposed
for
him
by
his
grateful
little
niece
,
and
*NL*
that
I
was
particularly
doubtful
of
the
policy
of
the
cocked
hat
;
but
I
*NL*
kept
these
sentiments
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Em
`
ly
had
stopped
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
in
her
enumeration
of
*NL*
these
articles
,
as
if
they
were
a
glorious
vision
.
We
went
on
again
,
*NL*
picking
up
shells
and
pebbles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
like
to
be
a
lady
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emily
looked
at
me
,
and
laughed
and
nodded
``
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
We
would
all
be
gentlefolks
together
,
then
.
*NL*
Me
,
and
uncle
,
and
Ham
,
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
We
would
n't
mind
then
,
when
*NL*
there
come
stormy
weather
.
--
Not
for
our
own
sakes
,
I
mean
.
We
would
for
*NL*
the
poor
fishermen
's
,
to
be
sure
,
and
we
'd
help
'em
with
money
when
they
*NL*
come
to
any
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
and
therefore
not
at
all
*NL*
improbable
picture
.
I
expressed
my
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
it
,
*NL*
and
little
Em
`
ly
was
emboldened
to
say
,
shyly
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
you
are
afraid
of
the
sea
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quiet
enough
to
reassure
me
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
if
I
had
seen
a
*NL*
moderately
large
wave
come
tumbling
in
,
I
should
have
taken
to
my
heels
,
*NL*
with
an
awful
recollection
of
her
drowned
relations
.
However
,
I
said
*NL*
``
No
,
''
and
I
added
,
``
You
do
n't
seem
to
be
,
either
,
though
you
say
you
*NL*
are
;
''
--
for
she
was
walking
much
too
near
the
brink
of
a
sort
of
old
*NL*
jetty
or
wooden
causeway
we
had
strolled
upon
,
and
I
was
afraid
of
her
*NL*
falling
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
in
this
way
,
''
said
little
Em
`
ly
.
``
But
I
wake
when
it
*NL*
blows
,
and
tremble
to
think
of
uncle
Dan
and
Ham
,
and
believe
I
hear
'em
*NL*
crying
out
for
help
.
That
's
why
I
should
like
so
much
to
be
a
lady
.
But
*NL*
I
'm
not
afraid
in
this
way
.
Not
a
bit
.
Look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
from
my
side
,
and
ran
along
a
jagged
timber
which
protruded
*NL*
from
the
place
we
stood
upon
,
and
overhung
the
deep
water
at
some
*NL*
height
,
without
the
least
defence
.
The
incident
is
so
impressed
on
my
*NL*
remembrance
,
that
if
I
were
a
draughtsman
I
could
draw
its
form
here
,
I
*NL*
daresay
,
accurately
as
it
was
that
day
,
and
little
Em
`
ly
springing
*NL*
forward
to
her
destruction
-LRB-
as
it
appeared
to
me
-RRB-
,
with
a
look
that
I
*NL*
have
never
forgotten
,
directed
far
out
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
,
bold
,
fluttering
little
figure
turned
and
came
back
safe
to
*NL*
me
,
and
I
soon
laughed
at
my
fears
,
and
at
the
cry
I
had
uttered
;
*NL*
fruitlessly
in
any
case
,
for
there
was
no
one
near
.
But
there
have
been
*NL*
times
since
,
in
my
manhood
,
many
times
there
have
been
,
when
I
have
*NL*
thought
,
Is
it
possible
,
among
the
possibilities
of
hidden
things
,
that
*NL*
in
the
sudden
rashness
of
the
child
and
her
wild
look
so
far
off
,
there
*NL*
was
any
merciful
attraction
of
her
into
danger
,
any
tempting
her
towards
*NL*
him
permitted
on
the
part
of
her
dead
father
,
that
her
life
might
have
a
*NL*
chance
of
ending
that
day
.
There
has
been
a
time
since
when
I
have
*NL*
wondered
whether
,
if
the
life
before
her
could
have
been
revealed
to
me
*NL*
at
a
glance
,
and
so
revealed
as
that
a
child
could
fully
comprehend
it
,
*NL*
and
if
her
preservation
could
have
depended
on
a
motion
of
my
hand
,
I
*NL*
ought
to
have
held
it
up
to
save
her
.
There
has
been
a
time
since
--
I
do
*NL*
not
say
it
lasted
long
,
but
it
has
been
--
when
I
have
asked
myself
the
*NL*
question
,
would
it
have
been
better
for
little
Em
`
ly
to
have
had
the
*NL*
waters
close
above
her
head
that
morning
in
my
sight
;
and
when
I
have
*NL*
answered
Yes
,
it
would
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
may
be
premature
.
I
have
set
it
down
too
soon
,
perhaps
.
But
let
it
*NL*
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
strolled
a
long
way
,
and
loaded
ourselves
with
things
that
we
*NL*
thought
curious
,
and
put
some
stranded
star-fish
carefully
back
into
*NL*
the
water
--
I
hardly
know
enough
of
the
race
at
this
moment
to
be
quite
*NL*
certain
whether
they
had
reason
to
feel
obliged
to
us
for
doing
so
,
or
*NL*
the
reverse
--
and
then
made
our
way
home
to
Mr.
Peggotty
's
dwelling
.
We
*NL*
stopped
under
the
lee
of
the
lobster-outhouse
to
exchange
an
innocent
*NL*
kiss
,
and
went
in
to
breakfast
glowing
with
health
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
two
young
mavishes
,
''
Mr.
Peggotty
said
.
I
knew
this
meant
,
in
our
*NL*
local
dialect
,
like
two
young
thrushes
,
and
received
it
as
a
compliment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
was
in
love
with
little
Em
`
ly
.
I
am
sure
I
loved
that
baby
*NL*
quite
as
truly
,
quite
as
tenderly
,
with
greater
purity
,
and
more
*NL*
disinterestedness
,
than
can
enter
into
the
best
love
of
a
later
time
of
*NL*
life
,
high
and
ennobling
as
it
is
.
I
am
sure
my
fancy
raised
up
*NL*
something
round
that
blue-eyed
mite
of
a
child
,
which
etherealised
,
and
*NL*
made
a
very
angel
of
her
.
If
,
any
sunny
forenoon
,
she
had
spread
a
*NL*
little
pair
of
wings
and
flown
away
before
my
eyes
,
I
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
should
have
regarded
it
as
much
more
than
I
had
had
reason
to
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
used
to
walk
about
that
dim
old
flat
at
Yarmouth
in
a
loving
manner
,
*NL*
hours
and
hours
.
The
days
sported
by
us
,
as
if
Time
had
not
grown
up
*NL*
himself
yet
,
but
were
a
child
too
,
and
always
at
play
.
I
told
Em
`
ly
I
*NL*
adored
her
,
and
that
unless
she
confessed
she
adored
me
I
should
be
*NL*
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
killing
myself
with
a
sword
.
She
said
she
*NL*
did
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
any
sense
of
inequality
,
or
youthfulness
,
or
other
difficulty
in
*NL*
our
way
,
little
Em
`
ly
and
I
had
no
such
trouble
,
because
we
had
no
*NL*
future
.
We
made
no
more
provision
for
growing
older
,
than
we
did
for
*NL*
growing
younger
.
We
were
the
admiration
of
Mrs.
Gummidge
and
Peggotty
,
*NL*
who
used
to
whisper
of
an
evening
when
we
sat
,
lovingly
,
on
our
little
*NL*
locker
side
by
side
,
``
Lor
!
was
n't
it
beautiful
!
''
Mr.
Peggotty
smiled
at
*NL*
us
from
behind
his
pipe
,
and
Ham
grinned
all
the
evening
and
did
nothing
*NL*
else
.
They
had
something
of
the
sort
of
pleasure
in
us
,
I
suppose
,
that
*NL*
they
might
have
had
in
a
pretty
toy
,
or
a
pocket
model
of
the
Colosseum
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
found
out
that
Mrs.
Gummidge
did
not
always
make
herself
so
*NL*
agreeable
as
she
might
have
been
expected
to
do
,
under
the
circumstances
*NL*
of
her
residence
with
Mr.
Peggotty
.
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
was
rather
a
fretful
*NL*
disposition
,
and
she
whimpered
more
sometimes
than
was
comfortable
for
*NL*
other
parties
in
so
small
an
establishment
.
I
was
very
sorry
for
her
;
*NL*
but
there
were
moments
when
it
would
have
been
more
agreeable
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
if
Mrs.
Gummidge
had
had
a
convenient
apartment
of
her
own
to
*NL*
retire
to
,
and
had
stopped
there
until
her
spirits
revived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
went
occasionally
to
a
public
house
called
The
Willing
*NL*
Mind
.
I
discovered
this
,
by
his
being
out
on
the
second
or
third
evening
*NL*
of
our
visit
,
and
by
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
looking
up
at
the
dutch
clock
,
*NL*
between
eight
and
nine
,
and
saying
he
was
there
,
and
that
,
what
was
*NL*
more
,
she
had
known
in
the
morning
he
would
go
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
had
been
in
a
low
state
all
day
,
and
had
burst
into
tears
*NL*
in
the
forenoon
,
when
the
fire
smoked
.
``
I
am
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
''
were
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
words
,
when
that
unpleasant
occurrence
took
place
,
``
and
*NL*
everythink
goes
contrairy
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
'll
soon
leave
off
,
''
said
Peggotty
--
I
again
mean
our
*NL*
Peggotty
--
``
and
besides
,
you
know
,
it
's
not
more
disagreeable
to
you
than
*NL*
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
it
more
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
cold
day
,
with
cutting
blasts
of
wind
.
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
*NL*
peculiar
corner
of
the
fireside
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
warmest
and
*NL*
snuggest
in
the
place
,
as
her
chair
was
certainly
the
easiest
,
but
it
*NL*
did
n't
suit
her
that
day
at
all
.
She
was
constantly
complaining
of
the
*NL*
cold
,
and
of
its
occasioning
a
visitation
in
her
back
which
she
called
*NL*
``
the
creeps
.
''
At
last
she
shed
tears
on
that
subject
,
and
said
again
*NL*
that
she
was
``
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
and
everythink
went
contrairy
with
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
certainly
very
cold
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
Everybody
must
feel
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
it
more
than
other
people
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
at
dinner
;
when
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
always
helped
immediately
after
me
,
*NL*
to
whom
the
preference
was
given
as
a
visitor
of
distinction
.
The
fish
*NL*
were
small
and
bony
,
and
the
potatoes
were
a
little
burnt
.
We
all
*NL*
acknowledged
that
we
felt
this
something
of
a
disappointment
;
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
said
she
felt
it
more
than
we
did
,
and
shed
tears
again
,
and
*NL*
made
that
former
declaration
with
great
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
Mr.
Peggotty
came
home
about
nine
o'clock
,
this
*NL*
unfortunate
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
knitting
in
her
corner
in
a
very
wretched
*NL*
and
miserable
condition
.
Peggotty
had
been
working
cheerfully
.
Ham
had
*NL*
been
patching
up
a
great
pair
of
water-boots
;
and
I
,
with
little
Em
`
ly
*NL*
by
my
side
,
had
been
reading
to
them
.
Mrs.
Gummidge
had
never
made
any
*NL*
other
remark
than
a
forlorn
sigh
,
and
had
never
raised
her
eyes
since
*NL*
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mates
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
taking
his
seat
,
``
and
how
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
said
something
,
or
looked
something
,
to
welcome
him
,
except
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
,
who
only
shook

*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
a
clap
of
his
hands
.
``
Cheer
up

*NL*
old

-LRB-
Mr.
Peggotty
meant
old
girl
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
did
not
appear
to
be
able
to
cheer
up
.
She
took
out
an
old
*NL*
black
silk
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
;
but
instead
of
putting
it
in
*NL*
her
pocket
,
kept
it
out
,
and
wiped
them
again
,
and
still
kept
it
out
,
*NL*
ready
for
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
amiss

dame

''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

returned
Mrs.

.
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
yes

I
've
took
a
short
spell
at

said
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
I
should
drive
you
there

said
Mrs.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive

I
do
n't
want
no
driving

returned
Mr.
Peggotty
with
an
honest
*NL*
laugh
.
``
I
only
go
too
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
ready

''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
wiping
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

very

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Along

It
a

said
Mr.
Peggotty

``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

it

cried
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
``
I

that

but
that
I
go

Yes

yes

I
feel
more

and
I
show
it
more
.
It
's
my
misfortun

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
could
n't
help
thinking
,
as
I
sat
taking
in
all
this
,
that
the
*NL*
misfortune
extended
to
some
other
members
of
that
family
besides
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
.
But
Mr.
Peggotty
made
no
such
retort
,
only
answering
with
*NL*
another
entreaty
to
Mrs.
Gummidge
to
cheer
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
a
n't
what
I
could
wish
myself
to
be
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
``
I
am
far
*NL*
from

I

My

I
feel
my

and
they
make
me
contrairy

I
wish
I
did
n't
feel
'em
,
but
I
*NL*
do
.
I
wish
I
could
be
hardened
to
'em
,
but
I
a
n't
.
I
make
the
house
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
.
I
've
made
your
sister
so
all
day
,
*NL*
and
Master
Davy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
was
suddenly
melted
,
and
roared
out
``
No
,
you
have
n't
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
,
''
in
great
mental
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
far
from
right
that
I
should
do
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
``
It
a
n't
*NL*
a

I
had
better
go
into

die

I
am
a
lone
lorn

,
and
had
much
better
not
make
myself
contrairy
here
.
If
thinks
*NL*
must
go
contrairy
with

and
I
must
go
contrairy

let
me
go
*NL*
contrairy
in
my

Dan
`
l
,
I
'd
better
go
into
the
house
,
and
die
and
*NL*
be
a
riddance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
retired
with
these
words
,
and
betook
herself
to
bed
.
When
*NL*
she
was
gone
,
Mr.
Peggotty
,
who
had
not
exhibited
a
trace
of
any
feeling
*NL*
but
the
profoundest
sympathy
,
looked
round
upon
us
,
and
nodding
his
head
*NL*
with
a
lively
expression
of
that
sentiment
still
animating
his
face
,
*NL*
said
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
thinking
of
the
old
`
un
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
quite
understand
what
old
one
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
supposed
to
*NL*
have
fixed
her
mind
upon
,
until
Peggotty
,
on
seeing
me
to
bed
,
explained
*NL*
that
it
was
the
late
Mr.
Gummidge
;
and
that
her
brother
always
took
that
*NL*
for
a
received
truth
on
such
occasions
,
and
that
it
always
had
a
moving
*NL*
effect
upon
him
.
Some
time
after
he
was
in
his
hammock
that
night
,
I
*NL*
heard
him
myself
repeat
to
Ham
,
``
Poor
thing
!
She
's
been
thinking
of
the
*NL*
old
`
un
!
''
And
whenever
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
overcome
in
a
similar
manner
*NL*
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
-LRB-
which
happened
some
few
times
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
always
said
the
same
thing
in
extenuation
of
the
circumstance
,
and
*NL*
always
with
the
tenderest
commiseration
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
fortnight
slipped
away
,
varied
by
nothing
but
the
variation
of
*NL*
the
tide
,
which
altered
Mr.
Peggotty
's
times
of
going
out
and
coming
in
,
*NL*
and
altered
Ham
's
engagements
also
.
When
the
latter
was
unemployed
,
he
*NL*
sometimes
walked
with
us
to
show
us
the
boats
and
ships
,
and
once
or
*NL*
twice
he
took
us
for
a
row
.
I
do
n't
know
why
one
slight
set
of
*NL*
impressions
should
be
more
particularly
associated
with
a
place
than
*NL*
another
,
though
I
believe
this
obtains
with
most
people
,
in
reference
*NL*
especially
to
the
associations
of
their
childhood
.
I
never
hear
the
*NL*
name
,
or
read
the
name
,
of
Yarmouth
,
but
I
am
reminded
of
a
certain
*NL*
Sunday
morning
on
the
beach
,
the
bells
ringing
for
church
,
little
Em
`
ly
*NL*
leaning
on
my
shoulder
,
Ham
lazily
dropping
stones
into
the
water
,
and
*NL*
the
sun
,
away
at
sea
,
just
breaking
through
the
heavy
mist
,
and
showing
*NL*
us
the
ships
,
like
their
own
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
day
came
for
going
home
.
I
bore
up
against
the
separation
*NL*
from
Mr.
Peggotty
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
but
my
agony
of
mind
at
leaving
*NL*
little
Em
`
ly
was
piercing
.
We
went
arm-in-arm
to
the
public-house
where
*NL*
the
carrier
put
up
,
and
I
promised
,
on
the
road
,
to
write
to
her
.
-LRB-
I
*NL*
redeemed
that
promise
afterwards
,
in
characters
larger
than
those
in
*NL*
which
apartments
are
usually
announced
in
manuscript
,
as
being
to
let
-RRB-
.
*NL*
We
were
greatly
overcome
at
parting
;
and
if
ever
,
in
my
life
,
I
have
had
*NL*
a
void
made
in
my
heart
,
I
had
one
made
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
all
the
time
I
had
been
on
my
visit
,
I
had
been
ungrateful
to
my
*NL*
home
again
,
and
had
thought
little
or
nothing
about
it
.
But
I
was
no
*NL*
sooner
turned
towards
it
,
than
my
reproachful
young
conscience
seemed
to
*NL*
point
that
way
with
a
steady
finger
;
and
I
felt
,
all
the
more
for
the
*NL*
sinking
of
my
spirits
,
that
it
was
my
nest
,
and
that
my
mother
was
my
*NL*
comforter
and
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gained
upon
me
as
we
went
along
;
so
that
the
nearer
we
drew
,
and
*NL*
the
more
familiar
the
objects
became
that
we
passed
,
the
more
excited
I
*NL*
was
to
get
there
,
and
to
run
into
her
arms
.
But
Peggotty
,
instead
of
*NL*
sharing
in
these
transports
,
tried
to
check
them
-LRB-
though
very
kindly
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
looked
confused
and
out
of
sorts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blunderstone
Rookery
would
come
,
however
,
in
spite
of
her
,
when
the
*NL*
carrier
's
horse
pleased
--
and
did
.
How
well
I
recollect
it
,
on
a
cold
*NL*
grey
afternoon
,
with
a
dull
sky
,
threatening
rain
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
I
looked
,
half
laughing
and
half
crying
in
my
*NL*
pleasant
agitation
,
for
my
mother
.
It
was
not
she
,
but
a
strange
*NL*
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Peggotty
!
''
I
said
,
ruefully
,
``
is
n't
she
come
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Master
Davy
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
She
's
come
home
.
Wait
a
bit
,
*NL*
Master
Davy
,
and
I
'll
--
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
her
agitation
,
and
her
natural
awkwardness
in
getting
out
of
the
*NL*
cart
,
Peggotty
was
making
a
most
extraordinary
festoon
of
herself
,
but
I
*NL*
felt
too
blank
and
strange
to
tell
her
so
.
When
she
had
got
down
,
she
*NL*
took
me
by
the
hand
;
led
me
,
wondering
,
into
the
kitchen
;
and
shut
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
!
''
said
I
,
quite
frightened
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
bless
you
,
Master
Davy
dear
!
''
she
answered
,
*NL*
assuming
an
air
of
sprightliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
's
the
matter
,
I
'm
sure
.
Where
's
mama
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
mama
,
Master
Davy
?
''
repeated
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Why
has
n't
she
come
out
to
the
gate
,
and
what
have
we
come
in
here
*NL*
for
?
Oh
,
Peggotty
!
''
My
eyes
were
full
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
were
going
to
*NL*
tumble
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
the
precious
boy
!
''
cried
Peggotty
,
taking
hold
of
me
.
``
What
is
*NL*
it
?
Speak
,
my
pet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
dead
,
too
!
Oh
,
she
's
not
dead
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
cried
out
No
!
with
an
astonishing
volume
of
voice
;
and
then
sat
*NL*
down
,
and
began
to
pant
,
and
said
I
had
given
her
a
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
her
a
hug
to
take
away
the
turn
,
or
to
give
her
another
turn
in
*NL*
the
right
direction
,
and
then
stood
before
her
,
looking
at
her
in
*NL*
anxious
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
dear
,
I
should
have
told
you
before
now
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
but
*NL*
I
had
n't
an
opportunity
.
I
ought
to
have
made
it
,
perhaps
,
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
azackly
''
--
that
was
always
the
substitute
for
exactly
,
in
*NL*
Peggotty
's
militia
of
words
--
``
bring
my
mind
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
Peggotty
,
''
said
I
,
more
frightened
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Davy
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
untying
her
bonnet
with
a
shaking
hand
,
*NL*
and
speaking
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
.
``
What
do
you
think
?
You
have
*NL*
got
a
Pa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
,
and
turned
white
.
Something
--
I
do
n't
know
what
,
or
*NL*
how
--
connected
with
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
and
the
raising
of
the
*NL*
dead
,
seemed
to
strike
me
like
an
unwholesome
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
one
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
one
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
gave
a
gasp
,
as
if
she
were
swallowing
something
that
was
very
*NL*
hard
,
and
,
putting
out
her
hand
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
And
your
mamma
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ceased
to
draw
back
,
and
we
went
straight
to
the
best
parlor
,
where
*NL*
she
left
me
.
On
one
side
of
the
fire
,
sat
my
mother
;
on
the
other
,
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
.
My
mother
dropped
her
work
,
and
arose
hurriedly
,
but
timidly
*NL*
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Clara
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
.
``
Recollect
!
controul
yourself
,
*NL*
always
controul
yourself
!
Davy
boy
,
how
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
my
hand
.
After
a
moment
of
suspense
,
I
went
and
kissed
my
*NL*
mother
:
she
kissed
me
,
patted
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
to
her
work
.
I
could
not
look
at
her
,
I
could
not
look
at
him
,
I
*NL*
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
looking
at
us
both
;
and
I
turned
to
the
*NL*
window
and
looked
out
there
,
at
some
shrubs
that
were
drooping
their
*NL*
heads
in
the
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
could
creep
away
,
I
crept
up-stairs
.
My
old
dear
bedroom
*NL*
was
changed
,
and
I
was
to
lie
a
long
way
off
.
I
rambled
down-stairs
*NL*
to
find
anything
that
was
like
itself
,
so
altered
it
all
seemed
;
and
*NL*
roamed
into
the
yard
.
I
very
soon
started
back
from
there
,
for
the
*NL*
empty
dog-kennel
was
filled
up
with
a
great
dog
--
deep
mouthed
and
*NL*
black-haired
like
Him
--
and
he
was
very
angry
at
the
sight
of
me
,
and
*NL*
sprung
out
to
get
at
me
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
FALL
INTO
DISGRACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
room
to
which
my
bed
was
removed
,
were
a
sentient
thing
that
*NL*
could
give
evidence
,
I
might
appeal
to
it
at
this
day
--
who
sleeps
there
*NL*
now
,
I
wonder
!
--
to
bear
witness
for
me
what
a
heavy
heart
I
carried
to
*NL*
it
.
I
went
up
there
,
hearing
the
dog
in
the
yard
bark
after
me
all
the
*NL*
way
while
I
climbed
the
stairs
;
and
,
looking
as
blank
and
strange
upon
*NL*
the
room
as
the
room
looked
upon
me
,
sat
down
with
my
small
hands
*NL*
crossed
,
and
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
the
oddest
things
.
Of
the
shape
of
the
room
,
of
the
*NL*
cracks
in
the
ceiling
,
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
,
of
the
flaws
in
*NL*
the
window-glass
making
ripples
and
dimples
on
the
prospect
,
of
*NL*
the
washing-stand
being
ricketty
on
its
three
legs
,
and
having
a
*NL*
discontented
something
about
it
,
which
reminded
me
of
Mrs.
Gummidge
*NL*
under
the
influence
of
the
old
one
.
I
was
crying
all
the
time
,
but
,
*NL*
except
that
I
was
conscious
of
being
cold
and
dejected
,
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
never
thought
why
I
cried
.
At
last
in
my
desolation
I
began
to
consider
*NL*
that
I
was
dreadfully
in
love
with
little
Em
`
ly
,
and
had
been
torn
away
*NL*
from
her
to
come
here
where
no
one
seemed
to
want
me
,
or
to
care
about
*NL*
me
,
half
as
much
as
she
did
.
This
made
such
a
very
miserable
piece
of
*NL*
business
of
it
,
that
I
rolled
myself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
counterpane
,
*NL*
and
cried
myself
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
awoke
by
somebody
saying
``
Here
he
is
!
''
and
uncovering
my
hot
head
.
*NL*
My
mother
and
Peggotty
had
come
to
look
for
me
,
and
it
was
one
of
them
*NL*
who
had
done
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davy
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
very
strange
that
she
should
ask
me
,
and
answered
,
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
I
turned
over
on
my
face
,
I
recollect
,
to
hide
my
trembling
*NL*
lip
,
which
answered
her
with
greater
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davy
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
Davy
,
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dare
say
no
words
she
could
have
uttered
,
would
have
affected
me
so
*NL*
much
,
then
,
as
her
calling
me
her
child
.
I
hid
my
tears
in
the
*NL*
bedclothes
,
and
pressed
her
from
me
with
my
hand
,
when
she
would
have
*NL*
raised
me
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
your
doing
,
Peggotty
,
you
cruel
thing
!
''
said
my
mother
.
``
I
have
*NL*
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
.
How
can
you
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience
,
I
*NL*
wonder
,
to
prejudice
my
own
boy
against
me
,
or
against
anybody
who
is
*NL*
dear
to
me
?
What
do
you
mean
by
it
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Peggotty
lifted
up
her
hands
and
eyes
,
and
only
answered
,
in
a
sort
*NL*
of
paraphrase
of
the
grace
I
usually
repeated
after
dinner
,
``
Lord
*NL*
forgive
you
,
Mrs.
Copperfield
,
and
for
what
you
have
said
this
minute
,
*NL*
may
you
never
be
truly
sorry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
enough
to
distract
me
,
''
cried
my
mother
.
``
In
my
honeymoon
,
too
,
*NL*
when
my
most
inveterate
enemy
might
relent
,
one
would
think
,
and
not
*NL*
envy
me
a
little
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
.
Davy
,
you
naughty
boy
!
*NL*
Peggotty
,
you
savage
creature
!
Oh
,
dear
me
!
''
cried
my
mother
,
turning
*NL*
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
,
in
her
pettish
wilful
manner
,
``
what
a
*NL*
troublesome
world
this
is
,
when
one
has
the
most
right
to
expect
it
to
*NL*
be
as
agreeable
as
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
touch
of
a
hand
that
I
knew
was
neither
her
's
nor
Peggotty
's
,
*NL*
and
slipped
to
my
feet
at
the
bed-side
.
It
was
Mr.
Murdstone
's
hand
,
and
*NL*
he
kept
it
on
my
arm
as
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
Clara
,
my
love
,
have
you
forgotten
?
--
Firmness
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
Edward
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
I
meant
to
be
very
good
,
but
*NL*
I
am
so
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
he
answered
.
``
That
's
a
bad
hearing
,
so
soon
,
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
it
's
very
hard
I
should
be
made
so
now
,
''
returned
my
mother
,
*NL*
pouting
;
``
and
it
is
--
very
hard
--
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
her
to
him
,
whispered
in
her
ear
,
and
kissed
her
.
I
knew
as
*NL*
well
,
when
I
saw
my
mother
's
head
lean
down
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
her
*NL*
arm
touch
his
neck
--
I
knew
as
well
that
he
could
mould
her
pliant
nature
*NL*
into
any
form
he
chose
,
as
I
know
,
now
,
that
he
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
you
below
,
my
love
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
.
``
David
and
I
will
come
*NL*
down
,
together
.
My
friend
,
''
turning
a
darkening
face
on
Peggotty
,
when
*NL*
he
had
watched
my
mother
out
,
and
dismissed
her
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
:
*NL*
``
do
you
know
your
mistress
's
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
my
mistress
a
long
time
,
sir
,
''
answered
Peggotty
.
``
I
ought
*NL*
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
he
answered
.
``
But
I
thought
I
heard
you
,
as
I
came
*NL*
up-stairs
,
address
her
by
a
name
that
is
not
hers
.
She
has
taken
mine
,
*NL*
you
know
.
Will
you
remember
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
,
with
some
uneasy
glances
at
me
,
curtseyed
herself
out
of
the
*NL*
room
without
replying
;
seeing
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
was
expected
to
go
,
*NL*
and
had
no
excuse
for
remaining
.
When
we
two
were
left
alone
,
he
shut
*NL*
the
door
,
and
sitting
on
a
chair
,
and
holding
me
standing
before
him
,
*NL*
looked
steadily
into
my
eyes
.
I
felt
my
own
attracted
,
no
less
steadily
,
*NL*
to
his
.
As
I
recall
our
being
opposed
thus
,
face
to
face
,
I
seem
again
*NL*
to
hear
my
heart
beat
fast
and
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
he
said
,
making
his
lips
thin
,
by
pressing
them
together
,
``
if
I
*NL*
have
an
obstinate
horse
or
dog
to
deal
with
,
what
do
you
think
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beat
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
answered
in
a
kind
of
breathless
whisper
,
but
I
felt
,
in
my
*NL*
silence
,
that
my
breath
was
shorter
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
him
wince
,
and
smart
.
I
say
to
myself
,
`
I
'll
conquer
that
*NL*
fellow
;
'
and
if
it
were
to
cost
him
all
the
blood
he
had
,
I
should
do
*NL*
it
.
What
is
that
upon
your
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dirt
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
it
was
the
mark
of
tears
as
well
as
I
.
But
if
he
had
asked
the
*NL*
question
twenty
times
,
each
time
with
twenty
blows
,
I
believe
my
baby
*NL*
heart
would
have
burst
before
I
would
have
told
him
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
for
a
little
fellow
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
a
grave
smile
that
belonged
to
him
,
``
and
you
understood
me
very
*NL*
well
,
I
see
.
Wash
that
face
,
sir
,
and
come
down
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
to
the
washing-stand
,
which
I
had
made
out
to
be
like
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
,
and
motioned
me
with
his
head
to
obey
him
directly
.
I
had
*NL*
little
doubt
then
,
and
I
have
less
doubt
now
,
that
he
would
have
knocked
*NL*
me
down
without
the
least
compunction
,
if
I
had
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
,
when
I
had
done
his
bidding
,
and
he
walked
me
*NL*
into
the
parlor
,
with
his
hand
still
on
my
arm
;
``
you
will
not
be
made
*NL*
uncomfortable
any
more
,
I
hope
.
We
shall
soon
improve
our
youthful
*NL*
humours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
God
help
me
,
I
might
have
been
improved
for
my
whole
life
,
I
might
have
*NL*
been
made
another
creature
perhaps
,
for
life
,
by
a
kind
word
at
that
*NL*
season
.
A
word
of
encouragement
and
explanation
,
of
pity
for
my
childish
*NL*
ignorance
,
of
welcome
home
,
of
reassurance
to
me
that
it
_
was
_
home
,
*NL*
might
have
made
me
dutiful
to
him
in
my
heart
henceforth
,
instead
of
in
*NL*
my
hypocritical
outside
,
and
might
have
made
me
respect
instead
of
hate
*NL*
him
.
I
thought
my
mother
was
sorry
to
see
me
standing
in
the
room
so
*NL*
scared
and
strange
,
and
that
,
presently
,
when
I
stole
to
a
chair
,
she
*NL*
followed
me
with
her
eyes
more
sorrowfully
still
--
missing
,
perhaps
,
some
*NL*
freedom
in
my
childish
tread
--
but
the
word
was
not
spoken
,
and
the
time
*NL*
for
it
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
dined
alone
,
we
three
together
.
He
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
my
*NL*
mother
--
I
am
afraid
I
liked
him
none
the
better
for
that
--
and
she
was
*NL*
very
fond
of
him
.
I
gathered
from
what
they
said
,
that
an
elder
sister
*NL*
of
his
was
coming
to
stay
with
them
,
and
that
she
was
expected
that
*NL*
evening
.
I
am
not
certain
whether
I
found
out
then
,
or
afterwards
,
*NL*
that
,
without
being
actively
concerned
in
any
business
,
he
had
some
*NL*
share
in
,
or
some
annual
charge
upon
the
profits
of
,
a
wine-merchant
's
*NL*
house
in
London
,
with
which
his
family
had
been
connected
from
his
*NL*
great-grandfather
's
time
,
and
in
which
his
sister
had
a
similar
*NL*
interest
;
but
I
may
mention
it
in
this
place
,
whether
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
when
we
were
sitting
by
the
fire
,
and
I
was
meditating
*NL*
an
escape
to
Peggotty
without
having
the
hardihood
to
slip
away
,
*NL*
lest
it
should
offend
the
master
of
the
house
,
a
coach
drove
up
to
*NL*
the
garden-gate
,
and
he
went
out
to
receive
the
visitor
.
My
mother
*NL*
followed
him
.
I
was
timidly
following
her
,
when
she
turned
round
at
the
*NL*
parlor-door
,
in
the
dusk
,
and
taking
me
in
her
embrace
as
she
had
been
*NL*
used
to
do
,
whispered
me
to
love
my
new
father
and
be
obedient
to
him
.
*NL*
She
did
this
hurriedly
and
secretly
,
as
if
it
were
wrong
,
but
tenderly
;
*NL*
and
,
putting
out
her
hand
behind
her
,
held
mine
in
it
,
until
we
came
*NL*
near
to
where
he
was
standing
in
the
garden
,
where
she
let
mine
go
,
and
*NL*
drew
her
's
through
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Miss
Murdstone
who
was
arrived
,
and
a
gloomy-looking
lady
she
*NL*
was
;
dark
,
like
her
brother
,
whom
she
greatly
resembled
in
face
and
*NL*
voice
;
and
with
very
heavy
eyebrows
,
nearly
meeting
over
her
large
nose
,
*NL*
as
if
,
being
disabled
by
the
wrongs
of
her
sex
from
wearing
whiskers
,
*NL*
she
had
carried
them
to
that
account
.
She
brought
with
her
,
two
*NL*
uncompromising
hard
black
boxes
,
with
her
initials
on
the
lids
in
hard
*NL*
brass
nails
.
When
she
paid
the
coachman
she
took
her
money
out
of
a
hard
*NL*
steel
purse
,
and
she
kept
the
purse
in
a
very
jail
of
a
bag
which
hung
*NL*
upon
her
arm
by
a
heavy
chain
,
and
shut
up
like
a
bite
.
I
had
never
,
at
*NL*
that
time
,
seen
such
a
metallic
lady
altogether
as
Miss
Murdstone
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
brought
into
the
parlor
with
many
tokens
of
welcome
,
and
there
*NL*
formally
recognised
my
mother
as
a
new
and
near
relation
.
Then
she
*NL*
looked
at
me
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
your
boy
,
sister-in-law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
acknowledged
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Generally
speaking
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
I
do
n't
like
boys
.
How
d'
ye
*NL*
do
,
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
these
encouraging
circumstances
,
I
replied
that
I
was
very
well
,
*NL*
and
that
I
hoped
she
was
the
same
;
with
such
an
indifferent
grace
,
that
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
disposed
of
me
in
two
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wants
manner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
uttered
which
,
with
great
distinctness
,
she
begged
the
favor
of
*NL*
being
shewn
to
her
room
,
which
became
to
me
from
that
time
forth
a
place
*NL*
of
awe
and
dread
,
wherein
the
two
black
boxes
were
never
seen
open
or
*NL*
known
to
be
left
unlocked
,
and
where
-LRB-
for
I
peeped
in
once
or
twice
when
*NL*
she
was
out
-RRB-
numerous
little
steel
fetters
and
rivets
,
with
which
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
embellished
herself
when
she
was
dressed
,
generally
hung
upon
*NL*
the
looking-glass
in
formidable
array
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
well
as
I
could
make
out
,
she
had
come
for
good
,
and
had
no
*NL*
intention
of
ever
going
again
.
She
began
to
``
help
''
my
mother
next
*NL*
morning
,
and
was
in
and
out
of
the
store-closet
all
day
,
putting
things
*NL*
to
rights
,
and
making
havoc
in
the
old
arrangements
.
Almost
the
first
*NL*
remarkable
thing
I
observed
in
Miss
Murdstone
was
,
her
being
constantly
*NL*
haunted
by
a
suspicion
that
the
servants
had
a
man
secreted
somewhere
*NL*
on
the
premises
.
Under
the
influence
of
this
delusion
,
she
dived
into
*NL*
the
coal-cellar
at
the
most
untimely
hours
,
and
scarcely
ever
opened
*NL*
the
door
of
a
dark
cupboard
without
clapping
it
to
again
,
in
the
belief
*NL*
that
she
had
got
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
was
nothing
very
airy
about
Miss
Murdstone
,
she
was
a
*NL*
perfect
Lark
in
point
of
getting
up
.
She
was
up
-LRB-
and
,
as
I
believe
to
*NL*
this
hour
,
looking
for
that
man
-RRB-
before
anybody
in
the
house
was
*NL*
stirring
.
Peggotty
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
she
even
slept
with
one
*NL*
eye
open
;
but
I
could
not
concur
in
this
idea
;
for
I
tried
it
myself
*NL*
after
hearing
the
suggestion
thrown
out
,
and
found
it
could
n't
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
very
first
morning
after
her
arrival
she
was
up
and
ringing
her
*NL*
bell
at
cock-crow
.
When
my
mother
came
down
to
breakfast
and
was
going
*NL*
to
make
the
tea
,
Miss
Murdstone
gave
her
a
kind
of
peck
on
the
cheek
,
*NL*
which
was
her
nearest
approach
to
a
kiss
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Clara
,
my
dear
,
I
am
come
here
,
you
know
,
to
relieve
you
of
all
*NL*
the
trouble
I
can
.
You
're
much
too
pretty
and
thoughtless
''
--
my
mother
*NL*
blushed
but
laughed
,
and
seemed
not
to
dislike
this
character
--
``
to
have
*NL*
any
duties
imposed
upon
you
that
can
be
undertaken
by
me
.
If
you
'll
be
*NL*
so
good
as
give
me
your
keys
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
attend
to
all
this
sort
of
*NL*
thing
in
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
,
Miss
Murdstone
kept
the
keys
in
her
own
little
jail
all
*NL*
day
,
and
under
her
pillow
all
night
,
and
my
mother
had
no
more
to
do
*NL*
with
them
than
I
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
did
not
suffer
her
authority
to
pass
from
her
without
a
shadow
*NL*
of
protest
.
One
night
when
Miss
Murdstone
had
been
developing
certain
*NL*
household
plans
to
her
brother
,
of
which
he
signified
his
approbation
,
*NL*
my
mother
suddenly
began
to
cry
,
and
said
she
thought
she
might
have
*NL*
been
consulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
sternly
.
``
Clara
!
I
wonder
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
very
well
to
say
you
wonder
,
Edward
!
''
cried
my
mother
,
``
and
*NL*
it
's
very
well
for
you
to
talk
about
firmness
,
but
you
would
n't
like
it
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Firmness
,
I
may
observe
,
was
the
grand
quality
on
which
both
Mr.
and
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
took
their
stand
.
However
I
might
have
expressed
my
*NL*
comprehension
of
it
at
that
time
,
if
I
had
been
called
upon
,
I
*NL*
nevertheless
did
clearly
comprehend
in
my
own
way
,
that
it
was
another
*NL*
name
for
tyranny
;
and
for
a
certain
gloomy
,
arrogant
,
devil
's
humour
,
*NL*
that
was
in
them
both
.
The
creed
,
as
I
should
state
it
now
,
was
this
.
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
was
firm
;
nobody
in
his
world
was
to
be
so
firm
as
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
;
nobody
else
in
his
world
was
to
be
firm
at
all
,
for
everybody
*NL*
was
to
be
bent
to
his
firmness
.
Miss
Murdstone
was
an
exception
.
She
*NL*
might
be
firm
,
but
only
by
relationship
,
and
in
an
inferior
and
*NL*
tributary
degree
.
My
mother
was
another
exception
.
She
might
be
firm
,
*NL*
and
must
be
;
but
only
in
bearing
their
firmness
,
and
firmly
believing
*NL*
there
was
no
other
firmness
upon
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
hard
,
''
said
my
mother
,
``
that
in
my
own
house
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
My
_
own
house
?
''
repeated
Mr.
Murdstone
.
``
Clara
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Our
_
own
house
,
I
mean
,
''
faltered
my
mother
,
evidently
frightened
--
``
I
*NL*
hope
you
must
know
what
I
mean
,
Edward
--
it
's
very
hard
that
in
_
your
_
*NL*
own
house
I
may
not
have
a
word
to
say
about
domestic
matters
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
managed
very
well
before
we
were
married
.
There
's
evidence
,
''
said
my
*NL*
mother
,
sobbing
;
``
ask
Peggotty
if
I
did
n't
do
very
well
when
I
was
n't
*NL*
interfered
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
let
there
be
an
end
of
this
.
I
go
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
Murdstone
,
''
said
her
brother
,
``
be
silent
!
How
dare
you
to
*NL*
insinuate
that
you
do
n't
know
my
character
better
than
your
words
*NL*
imply
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
my
poor
mother
went
on
,
at
a
grievous
disadvantage
,
and
*NL*
with
many
tears
,
``
I
do
n't
want
anybody
to
go

I
should
be
very
miserable
*NL*
and
unhappy
if
anybody
was
to
go
.
I
do
n't
ask
much
.
I
am
not
*NL*
unreasonable
.
I
only
want
to
be
consulted
sometimes
.
I
am
very
much
*NL*
obliged
to
anybody
who
assists
me
,
and
I
only
want
to
be
consulted
as
a
*NL*
mere
form
,
sometimes
.
I
thought
you
were
pleased
,
once
,
with
my
being
a
*NL*
little
inexperienced
and
girlish
,
Edward
--
I
am
sure
you
said
so
--
but
you
*NL*
seem
to
hate
me
for
it
now
,
you
are
so
severe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
again
,
``
let
there
be
an
end
of
this
.
I
go
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
Murdstone
,
''
thundered
Mr.
Murdstone
.
``
Will
you
be
silent
?
How
dare
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
made
a
jail-delivery
of
her
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
held
*NL*
it
before
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
,
''
he
continued
,
looking
at
my
mother
,
``
you
surprise
me
!
You
*NL*
astound
me
!
Yes
,
I
had
a
satisfaction
in
the
thought
of
marrying
an
*NL*
inexperienced
and
artless
person
,
and
forming
her
character
,
and
*NL*
infusing
into
it
some
amount
of
that
firmness
and
decision
of
which
it
*NL*
stood
in
need
.
But
when
Jane
Murdstone
is
kind
enough
to
come
to
my
*NL*
assistance
in
this
endeavour
,
and
to
assume
,
for
my
sake
,
a
condition
*NL*
something
like
a
housekeeper
's
,
and
when
she
meets
with
a
base
return
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pray
,
pray
,
Edward
,
''
cried
my
mother
,
``
do
n't
accuse
me
of
being
*NL*
ungrateful

I
am
sure
I
am
not
ungrateful

No

ever
said
I
was

I
have
many
faults

but
not
that

Oh

n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Jane
Murdstone
meets
,
I
say
,
''
he
went
on
,
after
waiting
until
my
*NL*
mother
was
silent
,
``
with
a
base
return
,
that
feeling
of
mine
is
chilled
*NL*
and
altered

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

implored
my

very
piteously
.
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
extent
of
mere
weakness

Clara

said
Mr.
Murdstone
in
*NL*
reply
,
``

You
lose
breath

*NL*
``

should
be
quite
broken-hearted

of
leaving
--
''
My
mother
*NL*
was
too
much
overcome
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
Murdstone
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
to
his
sister
,
``
any
harsh
words
*NL*
between
us
are
,
I
hope
,
uncommon
.
It
is
not
my
fault
that
so
unusual
an
*NL*
occurrence
has
taken
place
to-night
.
I
was
betrayed
into
it
by
another
.
*NL*
Nor
is
it
your
fault
.
You
were
betrayed
into
it
by
another
.
Let
us
both
*NL*
try
to
forget
it
.
And
as
this
,
''
he
added
,
after
these
magnanimous
words
,
*NL*
``
is
not
a
fit
scene
for
the
boy
--
David
,
go
to
bed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hardly
find
the
door
,
through
the
tears
that
stood
in
my
eyes
.
I
*NL*
was
so
sorry
for
my
mother
's
distress
;
but
I
groped
my
way
out
,
and
*NL*
groped
my
way
up
to
my
room
in
the
dark
,
without
even
having
the
heart
*NL*
to
say
good
night
to
Peggotty
,
or
to
get
a
candle
from
her
.
When
her
*NL*
coming
up
to
look
for
me
,
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
,
awoke
me
,
she
said
*NL*
that
my
mother
had
gone
to
bed
poorly
,
and
that
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
were
sitting
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
down
next
morning
rather
earlier
than
usual
,
I
paused
outside
the
*NL*
parlor-door
,
on
hearing
my
mother
's
voice
.
She
was
very
earnestly
and
*NL*
humbly
entreating
Miss
Murdstone
's
pardon
,
which
that
lady
granted
,
and
*NL*
a
perfect
reconciliation
took
place
.
I
never
knew
my
mother
afterwards
*NL*
to
give
an
opinion
on
any
matter
,
without
first
appealing
to
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
,
or
without
having
first
ascertained
,
by
some
sure
means
,
what
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
's
opinion
was
;
and
I
never
saw
Miss
Murdstone
,
when
out
*NL*
of
temper
-LRB-
she
was
infirm
that
way
-RRB-
,
move
her
hand
towards
her
bag
as
if
*NL*
she
were
going
to
take
out
the
keys
and
offer
to
resign
them
to
my
*NL*
mother
,
without
seeing
that
my
mother
was
in
a
terrible
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gloomy
taint
that
was
in
the
Murdstone
blood
,
darkened
the
Murdstone
*NL*
religion
,
which
was
austere
and
wrathful
.
I
have
thought
,
since
,
that
*NL*
its
assuming
that
character
was
a
necessary
consequence
of
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
's
firmness
,
which
would
n't
allow
him
to
let
any
body
off
from
*NL*
the
utmost
weight
of
the
severest
penalties
he
could
find
any
excuse
*NL*
for
.
Be
this
as
it
may
,
I
well
remember
the
tremendous
visages
with
*NL*
which
we
used
to
go
to
church
,
and
the
changed
air
of
the
place
.
Again
,
*NL*
the
dreaded
Sunday
comes
round
,
and
I
file
into
the
old
pew
first
,
like
*NL*
a
guarded
captive
brought
to
a
condemned
service
.
Again
,
Miss
Murdstone
,
*NL*
in
a
black
velvet
gown
,
that
looks
as
if
it
had
been
made
out
of
a
pall
,
*NL*
follows
close
upon
me
;
then
my
mother
;
then
her
husband
.
There
is
no
*NL*
Peggotty
now
,
as
in
the
old
time
.
Again
,
I
listen
to
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
mumbling
the
responses
,
and
emphasising
all
the
dread
words
with
a
cruel
*NL*
relish
.
Again
,
I
see
her
dark
eyes
roll
round
the
church
when
she
says
*NL*
``
miserable
sinners
,
''
as
if
she
were
calling
all
the
congregation
names
.
*NL*
Again
,
I
catch
rare
glimpses
of
my
mother
,
moving
her
lips
timidly
*NL*
between
the
two
,
with
one
of
them
muttering
at
each
ear
like
low
*NL*
thunder
.
Again
,
I
wonder
with
a
sudden
fear
whether
it
is
likely
that
*NL*
our
good
old
clergyman
can
be
wrong
,
and
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
right
,
*NL*
and
that
all
the
angels
in
Heaven
can
be
destroying
angels
.
Again
,
if
I
*NL*
move
a
finger
or
relax
a
muscle
of
my
face
,
Miss
Murdstone
pokes
me
with
*NL*
her
prayer-book
,
and
makes
my
side
ache
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
and
again
,
as
we
walk
home
,
I
note
some
neighbours
looking
at
my
*NL*
mother
,
and
at
me
,
and
whispering
.
Again
,
as
the
three
go
on
arm-in-arm
,
*NL*
and
I
linger
behind
alone
,
I
follow
some
of
those
looks
,
and
wonder
if
*NL*
my
mother
's
step
be
really
not
so
light
as
I
have
seen
it
,
and
if
the
*NL*
gaiety
of
her
beauty
be
really
almost
worried
away
.
Again
,
I
wonder
*NL*
whether
any
of
the
neighbours
call
to
mind
,
as
I
do
,
how
we
used
to
walk
*NL*
home
together
,
she
and
I
;
and
I
wonder
stupidly
about
that
,
all
the
*NL*
dreary
dismal
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
some
talk
on
occasions
of
my
going
to
boarding-school
.
*NL*
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
had
originated
it
,
and
my
mother
had
of
course
*NL*
agreed
with
them
.
Nothing
,
however
,
was
concluded
on
the
subject
yet
.
In
*NL*
the
meantime
,
I
learnt
lessons
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
I
ever
forget
those
lessons
!
They
were
presided
over
nominally
*NL*
by
my
mother
,
but
really
by
Mr.
Murdstone
and
his
sister
,
who
were
*NL*
always
present
,
and
found
them
a
favourable
occasion
for
giving
my
*NL*
mother
lessons
in
that
miscalled
firmness
,
which
was
the
bane
of
both
*NL*
our
lives
.
I
believe
I
was
kept
at
home
,
for
that
purpose
.
I
had
been
*NL*
apt
enough
to
learn
,
and
willing
enough
,
when
my
mother
and
I
had
*NL*
lived
alone
together
.
I
can
faintly
remember
learning
the
alphabet
at
*NL*
her
knee
.
To
this
day
,
when
I
look
upon
the
fat
black
letters
in
the
*NL*
primer
,
the
puzzling
novelty
of
their
shapes
,
and
the
easy
good-nature
*NL*
of
O
and
Q
and
S
,
seem
to
present
themselves
again
before
me
as
they
*NL*
used
to
do
.
But
they
recall
no
feeling
of
disgust
or
reluctance
.
On
*NL*
the
contrary
,
I
seem
to
have
walked
along
a
path
of
flowers
as
far
*NL*
as
the
crocodile-book
,
and
to
have
been
cheered
by
the
gentleness
of
*NL*
my
mother
's
voice
and
manner
all
the
way
.
But
these
solemn
lessons
*NL*
which
succeeded
those
,
I
remember
as
the
death-blow
at
my
peace
,
and
a
*NL*
grievous
daily
drudgery
and
misery
.
They
were
very
long
,
very
numerous
,
*NL*
very
hard
--
perfectly
unintelligible
,
some
of
them
,
to
me
--
and
I
was
*NL*
generally
as
much
bewildered
by
them
as
I
believe
my
poor
mother
was
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
me
remember
how
it
used
to
be
,
and
bring
one
morning
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
come
into
the
second-best
parlor
after
breakfast
,
with
my
books
,
*NL*
and
an
exercise-book
,
and
a
slate
.
My
mother
is
ready
for
me
at
her
*NL*
writing-desk
,
but
not
half
so
ready
as
Mr.
Murdstone
in
his
easy-chair
*NL*
by
the
window
-LRB-
though
he
pretends
to
be
reading
a
book
-RRB-
,
or
as
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
,
sitting
near
my
mother
stringing
steel
beads
.
The
very
sight
*NL*
of
these
two
has
such
an
influence
over
me
,
that
I
begin
to
feel
the
*NL*
words
I
have
been
at
infinite
pains
to
get
into
my
head
,
all
sliding
*NL*
away
,
and
going
I
do
n't
know
where
.
I
wonder
where
they
_
do
_
go
,
*NL*
by-the-by
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
hand
the
first
book
to
my
mother
.
Perhaps
it
is
a
grammar
,
perhaps
a
*NL*
history
,
or
geography
.
I
take
a
last
drowning
look
at
the
page
as
I
give
*NL*
it
into
her
hand
,
and
start
off
aloud
at
a
racing
pace
while
I
have
got
*NL*
it
fresh
.
I
trip
over
a
word
.
Mr.
Murdstone
looks
up
.
I
trip
over
*NL*
another
word
.
Miss
Murdstone
looks
up
.
I
redden
,
tumble
over
*NL*
half-a-dozen
words
,
and
stop
.
I
think
my
mother
would
show
me
the
book
*NL*
if
she
dared
,
but
she
does
not
dare
,
and
she
says
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Davy
,
Davy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Clara
,
''
says
Mr.
Murdstone
,
``
be
firm
with
the
boy
.
Do
n't
say
`
Oh
,
*NL*
Davy
,
Davy
!
'
That
's
childish
.
He
knows
his
lesson
,
or
he
does
not
know
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
_
not
_
know
it
,
''
Miss
Murdstone
interposes
awfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
really
afraid
he
does
not
,
''
says
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
see
,
Clara
,
''
returns
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
you
should
just
give
him
*NL*
the
book
back
,
and
make
him
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
,
''
says
my
mother
;
``
that
is
what
I
intend
to
do
,
my
dear
*NL*
Jane
.
Now
,
Davy
,
try
once
more
,
and
do
n't
be
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
obey
the
first
clause
of
the
injunction
by
trying
once
more
,
but
am
*NL*
not
so
successful
with
the
second
,
for
I
am
very
stupid
.
I
tumble
down
*NL*
before
I
get
to
the
old
place
,
at
a
point
where
I
was
all
right
before
,
*NL*
and
stop
to
think
.
But
I
ca
n't
think
about
the
lesson
.
I
think
of
the
*NL*
number
of
yards
of
net
in
Miss
Murdstone
's
cap
,
or
of
the
price
of
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
's
dressing-gown
,
or
any
such
ridiculous
problem
that
I
have
no
*NL*
business
with
,
and
do
n't
want
to
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
.
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
makes
a
movement
of
impatience
which
I
have
been
expecting
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
Miss
Murdstone
does
the
same
.
My
mother
glances
*NL*
submissively
at
them
,
shuts
the
book
,
and
lays
it
by
as
an
arrear
to
be
*NL*
worked
out
when
my
other
tasks
are
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
pile
of
these
arrears
very
soon
,
and
it
swells
like
a
rolling
*NL*
snowball
.
The
bigger
it
gets
,
the
more
stupid
_
I
_
get
.
The
case
is
so
*NL*
hopeless
,
and
I
feel
that
I
am
wallowing
in
such
a
bog
of
nonsense
,
that
*NL*
I
give
up
all
idea
of
getting
out
,
and
abandon
myself
to
my
fate
.
The
*NL*
despairing
way
in
which
my
mother
and
I
look
at
each
other
,
as
I
blunder
*NL*
on
,
is
truly
melancholy
.
But
the
greatest
effect
in
these
miserable
*NL*
lessons
is
when
my
mother
-LRB-
thinking
nobody
is
observing
her
-RRB-
tries
to
*NL*
give
me
the
cue
by
the
motion
of
her
lips
.
At
that
instant
,
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
,
who
has
been
lying
in
wait
for
nothing
else
all
along
,
says
*NL*
in
a
deep
warning
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
starts
,
colors
,
and
smiles
faintly
.
Mr.
Murdstone
comes
out
of
*NL*
his
chair
,
takes
the
book
,
throws
it
at
me
or
boxes
my
ears
with
it
,
and
*NL*
turns
me
out
of
the
room
by
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
the
lessons
are
done
,
the
worst
is
yet
to
happen
,
in
the
shape
*NL*
of
an
appalling
sum
.
This
is
invented
for
me
,
and
delivered
to
me
orally
*NL*
by
Mr.
Murdstone
,
and
begins
,
``
If
I
go
into
a
cheesemonger
's
shop
,
and
*NL*
buy
five
thousand
double-Gloucester
cheeses
at
fourpence-halfpenny
each
,
*NL*
present
payment
''
--
at
which
I
see
Miss
Murdstone
secretly
overjoyed
.
I
*NL*
pore
over
these
cheeses
without
any
result
or
enlightenment
until
*NL*
dinner-time
;
when
,
having
made
a
Mulatto
of
myself
by
getting
the
dirt
*NL*
of
the
slate
into
the
pores
of
my
skin
,
I
have
a
slice
of
bread
to
help
*NL*
me
out
with
the
cheeses
,
and
am
considered
in
disgrace
for
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
to
me
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
as
if
my
unfortunate
studies
*NL*
generally
took
this
course
.
I
could
have
done
very
well
if
I
had
been
*NL*
without
the
Murdstones
;
but
the
influence
of
the
Murdstones
upon
me
was
*NL*
like
the
fascination
of
two
snakes
on
a
wretched
young
bird
.
Even
when
I
*NL*
did
get
through
the
morning
with
tolerable
credit
,
there
was
not
much
*NL*
gained
but
dinner
;
for
Miss
Murdstone
never
could
endure
to
see
me
*NL*
untasked
,
and
if
I
rashly
made
any
show
of
being
unemployed
,
called
her
*NL*
brother
's
attention
to
me
by
saying
,
``
Clara
,
my
dear
,
there
's
nothing
*NL*
like
work
--
give
your
boy
an
exercise
;
''
which
caused
me
to
be
clapped
*NL*
down
to
some
new
labor
,
there
and
then
.
As
to
any
recreation
with
other
*NL*
children
of
my
age
,
I
had
very
little
of
that
;
for
the
gloomy
theology
*NL*
of
the
Murdstones
made
all
children
out
to
be
a
swarm
of
little
vipers
*NL*
-LRB-
though
there
_
was
_
a
child
once
set
in
the
midst
of
the
Disciples
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
held
that
they
contaminated
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
natural
result
of
this
treatment
,
continued
,
I
suppose
,
for
some
six
*NL*
months
or
more
,
was
to
make
me
sullen
,
dull
,
and
dogged
.
I
was
not
made
*NL*
the
less
so
,
by
my
sense
of
being
daily
more
and
more
shut
out
and
*NL*
alienated
from
my
mother
.
I
believe
I
should
have
been
almost
stupified
*NL*
but
for
one
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
.
My
father
had
left
a
small
collection
of
books
in
a
little
*NL*
room
up-stairs
,
to
which
I
had
access
-LRB-
for
it
adjoined
my
own
-RRB-
and
which
*NL*
nobody
else
in
our
house
ever
troubled
.
From
that
blessed
little
room
,
*NL*
Roderick
Random
,
Peregrine
Pickle
,
Humphrey
Clinker
,
Tom
Jones
,
The
*NL*
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
Don
Quixote
,
Gil
Blas
,
and
Robinson
Crusoe
,
came
*NL*
out
,
a
glorious
host
,
to
keep
me
company
.
They
kept
alive
my
fancy
,
and
*NL*
my
hope
of
something
beyond
that
place
and
time
,
--
they
,
and
the
Arabian
*NL*
Nights
,
and
the
Tales
of
the
Genii
,
--
and
did
me
no
harm
;
for
whatever
*NL*
harm
was
in
some
of
them
was
not
there
for
me
;
_
I
_
knew
nothing
of
it
.
*NL*
It
is
astonishing
to
me
now
,
how
I
found
time
,
in
the
midst
of
my
*NL*
porings
and
blunderings
over
heavier
themes
,
to
read
those
books
as
I
*NL*
did
.
It
is
curious
to
me
how
I
could
ever
have
consoled
myself
under
my
*NL*
small
troubles
-LRB-
which
were
great
troubles
to
me
-RRB-
,
by
impersonating
my
*NL*
favorite
characters
in
them
--
as
I
did
--
and
by
putting
Mr.
and
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
into
all
the
bad
ones
--
which
I
did
too
.
I
have
been
Tom
Jones
*NL*
-LRB-
a
child
's
Tom
Jones
,
a
harmless
creature
-RRB-
for
a
week
together
.
I
have
*NL*
sustained
my
own
idea
of
Roderick
Random
for
a
month
at
a
stretch
,
I
*NL*
verily
believe
.
I
had
a
greedy
relish
for
a
few
volumes
of
Voyages
and
*NL*
Travels
--
I
forget
what
,
now
--
that
were
on
those
shelves
;
and
for
days
*NL*
and
days
I
can
remember
to
have
gone
about
my
region
of
our
house
,
armed
*NL*
with
the
centre-piece
out
of
an
old
set
of
boot-trees
--
the
perfect
*NL*
realisation
of
Captain
Somebody
,
of
the
Royal
British
Navy
,
in
danger
of
*NL*
being
beset
by
savages
,
and
resolved
to
sell
his
life
at
a
great
price
.
*NL*
The
Captain
never
lost
dignity
,
from
having
his
ears
boxed
with
the
*NL*
Latin
Grammar
.
I
did
;
but
the
Captain
was
a
Captain
and
a
hero
,
in
*NL*
despite
of
all
the
grammars
of
all
the
languages
in
the
world
,
dead
or
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
only
and
my
constant
comfort
.
When
I
think
of
it
,
the
*NL*
picture
always
rises
in
my
mind
,
of
a
summer
evening
,
the
boys
at
play
*NL*
in
the
churchyard
,
and
I
sitting
on
my
bed
,
reading
as
if
for
life
.
*NL*
Every
barn
in
the
neighbourhood
,
every
stone
in
the
church
,
and
every
*NL*
foot
of
the
churchyard
,
had
some
association
of
its
own
,
in
my
mind
,
*NL*
connected
with
these
books
,
and
stood
for
some
locality
made
famous
in
*NL*
them
.
I
have
seen
Tom
Pipes
go
climbing
up
the
church-steeple
;
I
have
*NL*
watched
Strap
,
with
the
knapsack
on
his
back
,
stopping
to
rest
himself
*NL*
upon
the
wicket-gate
;
and
I
_
know
_
that
Commodore
Trunnion
held
that
*NL*
club
with
Mr.
Pickle
,
in
the
parlor
of
our
little
village
alehouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
now
understands
as
well
as
I
do
,
what
I
was
when
I
came
to
*NL*
that
point
of
my
youthful
history
to
which
I
am
now
coming
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
when
I
went
into
the
parlor
with
my
books
,
I
found
my
mother
*NL*
looking
anxious
,
Miss
Murdstone
looking
firm
,
and
Mr.
Murdstone
binding
*NL*
something
round
the
bottom
of
a
cane
--
a
lithe
and
limber
cane
,
which
he
*NL*
left
off
binding
when
I
came
in
,
and
poised
and
switched
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
Clara
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
``
I
have
been
often
flogged
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
;
of
course
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
''
faltered
my
mother
,
meekly
.
``
But
--
but
do
you
*NL*
think
it
did
Edward
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
did
Edward
harm
,
Clara
?
''
asked
Mr.
Murdstone
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
point
!
''
said
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
my
mother
returned
,
``
Certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
''
and
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
apprehensive
that
I
was
personally
interested
in
this
dialogue
,
*NL*
and
sought
Mr.
Murdstone
's
eye
as
it
lighted
on
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
David
,
''
he
said
--
and
I
saw
that
cast
again
,
as
he
said
it
--
``
you
*NL*
must
be
far
more
careful
to-day
than
usual
.
''
He
gave
the
cane
another
*NL*
poise
,
and
another
switch
;
and
having
finished
his
preparation
of
it
,
*NL*
laid
it
down
beside
him
,
with
an
expressive
look
,
and
took
up
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
good
freshener
to
my
presence
of
mind
,
as
a
beginning
.
I
felt
*NL*
the
words
of
my
lessons
slipping
off
,
not
one
by
one
,
or
line
by
line
,
*NL*
but
by
the
entire
page
.
I
tried
to
lay
hold
of
them
;
but
they
seemed
,
if
*NL*
I
may
so
express
it
,
to
have
put
skates
on
,
and
to
skim
away
from
me
*NL*
with
a
smoothness
there
was
no
checking
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
began
badly
,
and
went
on
worse
.
I
had
come
in
,
with
an
idea
of
*NL*
distinguishing
myself
rather
,
conceiving
that
I
was
very
well
prepared
;
*NL*
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
a
mistake
.
Book
after
book
was
added
to
*NL*
the
heap
of
failures
,
Miss
Murdstone
being
firmly
watchful
of
us
all
the
*NL*
time
.
And
when
we
came
at
last
to
the
five
thousand
cheeses
-LRB-
canes
he
*NL*
made
it
that
day
,
I
remember
-RRB-
,
my
mother
burst
out
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
her
warning
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
quite
well
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
think
,
''
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
him
wink
,
solemnly
,
at
his
sister
,
as
he
rose
and
said
,
taking
up
*NL*
the
cane
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Jane
,
we
can
hardly
expect
Clara
to
bear
,
with
perfect
firmness
,
*NL*
the
worry
and
torment
that
David
has
occasioned
her
to-day
.
That
would
*NL*
be
stoical
.
Clara
is
greatly
strengthened
and
improved
,
but
we
can
*NL*
hardly
expect
so
much
from
her
.
David
,
you
and
I
will
go
up-stairs
,
*NL*
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
took
me
out
at
the
door
,
my
mother
ran
towards
us
.
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
said
,
``
Clara
!
are
you
a
perfect
fool
?
''
and
interfered
.
I
saw
my
mother
*NL*
stop
her
ears
then
,
and
I
heard
her
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
me
up
to
my
room
slowly
and
gravely
--
I
am
certain
he
had
a
*NL*
delight
in
that
formal
parade
of
executing
justice
--
and
when
we
got
*NL*
there
,
suddenly
twisted
my
head
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Murdstone
!
Sir
!
''
I
cried
to
him
.
``
Do
n't
!
Pray
do
n't
beat
me
!
I
have
*NL*
tried
to
learn
,
sir
,
but
I
ca
n't
learn
while
you
and
Miss
Murdstone
are
*NL*
by
.
I
ca
n't
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
,
indeed
,
David
?
''
he
said
.
``
We
'll
try
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
my
head
as
in
a
vice
,
but
I
twined
round
him
somehow
,
and
stopped
*NL*
him
for
a
moment
,
entreating
him
not
to
beat
me
.
It
was
only
for
a
*NL*
moment
that
I
stopped
him
,
for
he
cut
me
heavily
an
instant
afterwards
,
*NL*
and
in
the
same
instant
I
caught
the
hand
with
which
he
held
me
in
my
*NL*
mouth
,
between
my
teeth
,
and
bit
it
through
.
It
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
to
*NL*
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beat
me
then
,
as
if
he
would
have
beaten
me
to
death
.
Above
all
the
*NL*
noise
we
made
,
I
heard
them
running
up
the
stairs
,
and
crying
out
--
I
*NL*
heard
my
mother
crying
out
--
and
Peggotty
.
Then
he
was
gone
;
and
the
door
*NL*
was
locked
outside
;
and
I
was
lying
,
fevered
and
hot
,
and
torn
,
and
*NL*
sore
,
and
raging
in
my
puny
way
,
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
well
I
recollect
,
when
I
became
quiet
,
what
an
unnatural
stillness
*NL*
seemed
to
reign
through
the
whole
house
!
How
well
I
remember
,
when
my
*NL*
smart
and
passion
began
to
cool
,
how
wicked
I
began
to
feel
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
listening
for
a
long
while
,
but
there
was
not
a
sound
.
I
crawled
*NL*
up
from
the
floor
,
and
saw
my
face
in
the
glass
,
so
swollen
,
red
,
and
*NL*
ugly
,
that
it
almost
frightened
me
.
My
stripes
were
sore
and
stiff
,
and
*NL*
made
me
cry
afresh
,
when
I
moved
;
but
they
were
nothing
to
the
guilt
I
*NL*
felt
.
It
lay
heavier
on
my
breast
than
if
I
had
been
a
most
atrocious
*NL*
criminal
,
I
dare
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
begun
to
grow
dark
,
and
I
had
shut
the
window
-LRB-
I
had
been
lying
,
*NL*
for
the
most
part
,
with
my
head
upon
the
sill
,
by
turns
crying
,
dozing
,
*NL*
and
looking
listlessly
out
-RRB-
,
when
the
key
was
turned
,
and
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
came
in
with
some
bread
and
meat
,
and
milk
.
These
she
put
down
upon
the
*NL*
table
without
a
word
,
glaring
at
me
the
while
with
exemplary
firmness
,
*NL*
and
then
retired
,
locking
the
door
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
after
it
was
dark
I
sat
there
,
wondering
whether
anybody
else
would
*NL*
come
.
When
this
appeared
improbable
for
that
night
,
I
undressed
,
and
*NL*
went
to
bed
;
and
,
there
,
I
began
to
wonder
fearfully
what
would
be
done
*NL*
to
me
.
Whether
it
was
a
criminal
act
that
I
had
committed
?
Whether
I
*NL*
should
be
taken
into
custody
,
and
sent
to
prison
?
Whether
I
was
at
all
*NL*
in
danger
of
being
hanged
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
shall
forget
the
waking
,
next
morning
;
the
being
cheerful
and
*NL*
fresh
for
the
first
moment
,
and
then
the
being
weighed
down
by
the
stale
*NL*
and
dismal
oppression
of
remembrance
.
Miss
Murdstone
reappeared
before
I
*NL*
was
out
of
bed
;
told
me
,
in
so
many
words
,
that
I
was
free
to
walk
in
*NL*
the
garden
for
half
an
hour
and
no
longer
;
and
retired
,
leaving
the
door
*NL*
open
,
that
I
might
avail
myself
of
that
permission
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
so
,
and
did
so
every
morning
of
my
imprisonment
,
which
lasted
five
*NL*
days
.
If
I
could
have
seen
my
mother
alone
,
I
should
have
gone
down
on
*NL*
my
knees
to
her
and
besought
her
forgiveness
;
but
I
saw
no
one
,
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
excepted
,
during
the
whole
time
--
except
at
evening
prayers
in
*NL*
the
parlor
;
to
which
I
was
escorted
by
Miss
Murdstone
after
everybody
*NL*
else
was
placed
;
where
I
was
stationed
,
a
young
outlaw
,
all
alone
by
*NL*
myself
near
the
door
;
and
whence
I
was
solemnly
conducted
by
my
jailer
,
*NL*
before
anyone
arose
from
the
devotional
posture
.
I
only
observed
that
my
*NL*
mother
was
as
far
off
from
me
as
she
could
be
,
and
kept
her
face
another
*NL*
way
so
that
I
never
saw
it
;
and
that
Mr.
Murdstone
's
hand
was
bound
up
*NL*
in
a
large
linen
wrapper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
length
of
those
five
days
I
can
convey
no
idea
of
to
any
one
.
They
*NL*
occupy
the
place
of
years
in
my
remembrance
.
The
way
in
which
I
listened
*NL*
to
all
the
incidents
of
the
house
that
made
themselves
audible
to
me
;
*NL*
the
ringing
of
bells
,
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
,
the
murmuring
*NL*
of
voices
,
the
footsteps
on
the
stairs
;
to
any
laughing
,
whistling
,
or
*NL*
singing
,
outside
,
which
seemed
more
dismal
than
anything
else
to
me
in
*NL*
my
solitude
and
disgrace
--
the
uncertain
pace
of
the
hours
,
especially
at
*NL*
night
,
when
I
would
wake
thinking
it
was
morning
,
and
find
that
the
*NL*
family
were
not
yet
gone
to
bed
,
and
that
all
the
length
of
night
had
*NL*
yet
to
come
--
the
depressed
dreams
and
nightmares
I
had
--
the
return
of
*NL*
day
,
noon
,
afternoon
,
evening
,
when
the
boys
played
in
the
churchyard
,
*NL*
and
I
watched
them
from
a
distance
within
the
room
,
being
ashamed
to
*NL*
show
myself
at
the
window
lest
they
should
know
I
was
a
prisoner
--
the
*NL*
strange
sensation
of
never
hearing
myself
speak
--
the
fleeting
intervals
*NL*
of
something
like
cheerfulness
,
which
came
with
eating
and
drinking
,
and
*NL*
went
away
with
it
--
the
setting
in
of
rain
one
evening
,
with
a
fresh
*NL*
smell
,
and
its
coming
down
faster
and
faster
between
me
and
the
church
,
*NL*
until
it
and
gathering
night
seemed
to
quench
me
in
gloom
,
and
fear
,
and
*NL*
remorse
--
all
this
appears
to
have
gone
round
and
round
for
years
instead
*NL*
of
days
,
it
is
so
vividly
and
strongly
stamped
on
my
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
last
night
of
my
restraint
,
I
was
awakened
by
hearing
my
own
name
*NL*
spoken
in
a
whisper
.
I
started
up
in
bed
,
and
putting
out
my
arms
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
immediate
answer
,
but
presently
I
heard
my
name
again
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
so
very
mysterious
and
awful
,
that
I
think
I
should
have
gone
into
*NL*
a
fit
,
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
it
must
have
come
through
the
*NL*
keyhole
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
groped
my
way
to
the
door
,
and
putting
my
own
lips
to
the
keyhole
,
*NL*
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Peggotty
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
own
precious
Davy
,
''
she
replied
.
``
Be
as
soft
as
a
mouse
,
or
the
*NL*
Cat
'll
hear
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
this
to
mean
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
was
sensible
of
the
*NL*
urgency
of
the
case
;
her
room
being
close
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
mama
,
dear
Peggotty
?
Is
she
very
angry
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
Peggotty
crying
softly
on
her
side
of
the
keyhole
,
as
I
was
*NL*
doing
on
mine
,
before
she
answered
.
``
No
.
Not
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
going
to
be
done
with
me
,
Peggotty
dear
?
Do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
School
.
Near
London
,
''
was
Peggotty
's
answer
.
I
was
obliged
to
get
her
*NL*
to
repeat
it
,
for
she
spoke
it
the
first
time
quite
down
my
throat
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
my
having
forgotten
to
take
my
mouth
away
from
the
*NL*
keyhole
and
put
my
ear
there
;
and
though
her
words
tickled
me
a
good
*NL*
deal
,
I
did
n't
hear
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
reason
why
Miss
Murdstone
took
the
clothes
out
of
my
*NL*
drawers
?
''
which
she
had
done
,
though
I
have
forgotten
to
mention
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
Box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
I
see
mama
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
Morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Peggotty
fitted
her
mouth
close
to
the
keyhole
,
and
delivered
these
*NL*
words
through
it
with
as
much
feeling
and
earnestness
as
a
keyhole
has
*NL*
ever
been
the
medium
of
communicating
,
I
will
venture
to
assert
:
*NL*
shooting
in
each
broken
little
sentence
in
a
convulsive
little
burst
of
*NL*
its
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davy
,
dear
.
If
I
ai
n't
ben
azackly
as
intimate
with
you
.
Lately
,
as
I
*NL*
used
to
be
.
It
ai
n't
because
I
do
n't
love
you
.
Just
as
well
and
more
,
my
*NL*
pretty
poppet
.
It
's
because
I
thought
it
better
for
you
.
And
for
some
*NL*
one
else
besides
.
Davy
,
my
darling
,
are
you
listening
?
Can
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
--
ye
--
ye
--
yes
,
Peggotty
!
''
I
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
!
''
said
Peggotty
,
with
infinite
compassion
.
``
What
I
want
to
say
,
*NL*
is
.
That
you
must
never
forget
me

For
I
'll
never
forget
you

And
I
'll
*NL*
take
as
much
care
of
your
mama

Davy

As
ever
I
took
of
you

And
I
wo

The
day
may
come
when
she
'll
be
glad
to
lay
her
poor
head

On
*NL*
her
stupid
,
cross
old
Peggotty
's
arm
again
.
And
I
'll
write
to
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
Though
I
ai
n't
no
scholar
.
And
I
'll
--
I
'll

''
Peggotty
fell
to
*NL*
kissing
the
keyhole
,
as
she
could
n't
kiss
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
dear
Peggotty
!
''
said
I.
``
Oh
,
thank
you
!
Thank
you
!
Will
you
*NL*
promise
me
one
thing
,
Peggotty
?
Will
you
write
and
tell
Mr.
Peggotty
and
*NL*
little
Em
`
ly
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
and
Ham
,
that
I
am
not
so
bad
as
they
*NL*
might
suppose
,
and
that
I
sent
'em
all
my
love
--
especially
to
little
*NL*
Em
`
ly
?
Will
you
,
if
you
please
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
kind
soul
promised
,
and
we
both
of
us
kissed
the
keyhole
with
the
*NL*
greatest
affection
--
I
patted
it
with
my
hand
,
I
recollect
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
her
honest
face
--
and
parted
.
From
that
night
there
grew
up
in
my
*NL*
breast
,
a
feeling
for
Peggotty
,
which
I
can
not
very
well
define
.
She
did
*NL*
not
replace
my
mother
;
no
one
could
do
that
;
but
she
came
into
a
vacancy
*NL*
in
my
heart
,
which
closed
upon
her
,
and
I
felt
towards
her
something
I
*NL*
have
never
felt
for
any
other
human
being
.
It
was
a
sort
of
comical
*NL*
affection
too
;
and
yet
if
she
had
died
,
I
can
not
think
what
I
should
*NL*
have
done
,
or
how
I
should
have
acted
out
the
tragedy
it
would
have
been
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Miss
Murdstone
appeared
as
usual
,
and
told
me
I
was
going
*NL*
to
school
;
which
was
not
altogether
such
news
to
me
as
she
supposed
.
She
*NL*
also
informed
me
that
when
I
was
dressed
,
I
was
to
come
down-stairs
into
*NL*
the
parlor
,
and
have
my
breakfast
.
There
,
I
found
my
mother
,
very
pale
*NL*
and
with
red
eyes
:
into
whose
arms
I
ran
,
and
begged
her
pardon
from
my
*NL*
suffering
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Davy
!
''
she
said
.
``
That
you
could
hurt
any
one
I
love
!
Try
to
be
*NL*
better
,
pray
to
be
better
!
I
forgive
you
;
but
I
am
so
grieved
,
Davy
,
*NL*
that
you
should
have
such
bad
passions
in
your
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
persuaded
her
that
I
was
a
wicked
fellow
,
and
she
was
more
*NL*
sorry
for
that
,
than
for
my
going
away
.
I
felt
it
sorely
.
I
tried
to
eat
*NL*
my
parting
breakfast
,
but
my
tears
dropped
upon
my
bread-and-butter
,
and
*NL*
trickled
into
my
tea
.
I
saw
my
mother
look
at
me
sometimes
,
and
then
*NL*
glance
at
the
watchful
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
then
look
down
,
or
look
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Copperfield
's
box
there
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
when
wheels
were
*NL*
heard
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
for
Peggotty
,
but
it
was
not
she
;
neither
she
nor
Mr.
Murdstone
*NL*
appeared
.
My
former
acquaintance
,
the
carrier
,
was
at
the
door
;
the
box
*NL*
was
taken
out
to
his
cart
,
and
lifted
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
her
warning
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
,
my
dear
Jane
,
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
Good
bye
,
Davy
.
You
are
*NL*
going
for
your
own
good
.
Good
bye
,
my
child
.
You
will
come
home
in
the
*NL*
holidays
,
and
be
a
better
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
Miss
Murdstone
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
''
replied
my
mother
,
who
was
holding
me
.
``
I
*NL*
forgive
you
,
my
dear
boy
.
God
bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
Miss
Murdstone
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
was
good
enough
to
take
me
out
to
the
cart
,
and
to
say
on
*NL*
the
way
that
she
hoped
I
would
repent
,
before
I
came
to
a
bad
end
;
and
*NL*
then
I
got
into
the
cart
,
and
the
lazy
horse
walked
off
with
it
.

CHAPTER
V.
*NL*
*NL*
I
AM
SENT
AWAY
FROM
HOME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
might
have
gone
about
half
a
mile
,
and
my
pocket-handkerchief
was
*NL*
quite
wet
through
,
when
the
carrier
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
out
to
ascertain
what
for
,
I
saw
,
to
my
amazement
,
Peggotty
*NL*
burst
from
a
hedge
and
climb
into
the
cart
.
She
took
me
in
both
her
*NL*
arms
,
and
squeezed
me
to
her
stays
until
the
pressure
on
my
nose
was
*NL*
extremely
painful
,
though
I
never
thought
of
that
till
afterwards
when
I
*NL*
found
it
very
tender
.
Not
a
single
word
did
Peggotty
speak
.
Releasing
*NL*
one
of
her
arms
,
she
put
it
down
in
her
pocket
to
the
elbow
,
and
brought
*NL*
out
some
paper
bags
of
cakes
which
she
crammed
into
my
pockets
,
and
a
*NL*
purse
which
she
put
into
my
hand
,
but
not
one
word
did
she
say
.
After
*NL*
another
and
a
final
squeeze
with
both
arms
,
she
got
down
from
the
cart
*NL*
and
ran
away
;
and
,
my
belief
is
,
and
has
always
been
,
without
a
solitary
*NL*
button
on
her
gown
.
I
picked
up
one
,
of
several
that
were
rolling
about
,
*NL*
and
treasured
it
as
a
keepsake
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carrier
looked
at
me
,
as
if
to
enquire
if
she
were
coming
back
.
I
*NL*
shook
my
head
,
and
said
I
thought
not
.
``
Then
come
up
,
''
said
the
carrier
*NL*
to
the
lazy
horse
;
who
came
up
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
by
this
time
cried
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
,
I
began
to
think
*NL*
it
was
of
no
use
crying
any
more
,
especially
as
neither
Roderick
Random
,
*NL*
nor
that
Captain
in
the
Royal
British
Navy
,
had
ever
cried
,
that
I
could
*NL*
remember
,
in
trying
situations
.
The
carrier
,
seeing
me
in
this
*NL*
resolution
,
proposed
that
my
pocket-handkerchief
should
be
spread
upon
*NL*
the
horse
's
back
to
dry
.
I
thanked
him
,
and
assented
;
and
particularly
*NL*
small
it
looked
,
under
those
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
leisure
to
examine
the
purse
.
It
was
a
stiff
leather
purse
,
*NL*
with
a
snap
,
and
had
three
bright
shillings
in
it
,
which
Peggotty
had
*NL*
evidently
polished
up
with
whitening
,
for
my
greater
delight
.
But
its
*NL*
most
precious
contents
were
two
half-crowns
folded
together
in
a
bit
of
*NL*
paper
,
on
which
was
written
,
in
my
mother
's
hand
,
``
For
Davy
.
With
my
*NL*
love
.
''
I
was
so
overcome
by
this
,
that
I
asked
the
carrier
to
be
so
good
*NL*
as
reach
me
my
pocket-handkerchief
again
;
but
he
said
he
thought
I
had
*NL*
better
do
without
it
;
and
I
thought
I
really
had
;
so
I
wiped
my
eyes
on
*NL*
my
sleeve
and
stopped
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
good
,
too
;
though
,
in
consequence
of
my
previous
emotions
,
I
was
*NL*
still
occasionally
seized
with
a
stormy
sob
.
After
we
had
jogged
on
for
*NL*
some
little
time
,
I
asked
the
carrier
if
he
was
going
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
way
where
?
''
enquired
the
carrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
there
?
''
enquired
the
carrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
London
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
horse
,
''
said
the
carrier
,
jerking
the
rein
to
point
him
out
,
*NL*
``
would
be
deader
than
pork
afore
he
got
over
half
the
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
only
going
to
Yarmouth
then
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
about
it
,
''
said
the
carrier
.
``
And
there
I
shall
take
you
to
the
*NL*
stage-cutch
,
and
the
stage-cutch
that
'll
take
you
to
--
wherever
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
a
great
deal
for
the
carrier
-LRB-
whose
name
was
Mr.
Barkis
-RRB-
to
*NL*
say
--
he
being
,
as
I
observed
in
a
former
chapter
,
of
a
phlegmatic
*NL*
temperament
,
and
not
at
all
conversational
--
I
offered
him
a
cake
as
a
*NL*
mark
of
attention
,
which
he
ate
at
one
gulp
,
exactly
like
an
elephant
,
*NL*
and
which
made
no
more
impression
on
his
big
face
than
it
would
have
*NL*
done
on
an
elephant
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
_
she
_
make
'em
,
now
?
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
always
leaning
forward
,
in
*NL*
his
slouching
way
,
on
the
footboard
of
the
cart
with
an
arm
on
each
*NL*
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
,
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
``
Her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
makes
all
our
pastry
,
and
does
all
our
cooking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
she
though
?
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
up
his
mouth
as
if
to
whistle
,
but
he
did
n't
whistle
.
He
sat
*NL*
looking
at
the
horse
's
ears
,
as
if
he
saw
something
new
there
;
and
sat
*NL*
so
,
for
a
considerable
time
.
By-and-by
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sweethearts
,
I
b
`
lieve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweetmeats
did
you
say
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
For
I
thought
he
wanted
something
*NL*
else
to
eat
,
and
had
pointedly
alluded
to
that
description
of
*NL*
refreshment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hearts
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
``
Sweet
hearts
;
no
person
walks
with
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
said
.
``
Her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
She
never
had
a
sweetheart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
she
though
!
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
made
up
his
mouth
to
whistle
,
and
again
he
did
n't
whistle
,
but
*NL*
sat
looking
at
the
horse
's
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
makes
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
after
a
long
interval
of
reflection
,
*NL*
``
all
the
apple
parsties
,
and
doos
all
the
cooking
,
do
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
such
was
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
``
P'raps
you
might
be
*NL*
writin
'
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
write
to
her
,
''
I
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
said
,
slowly
turning
his
eyes
towards
me
.
``
Well
!
If
you
was
*NL*
writin
'
to
her
,
p
`
raps
you
'd
recollect
to
say
that
Barkis
was
willin
'
;
*NL*
would
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Barkis
is
willing
,
''
I
repeated
,
innocently
.
``
Is
that
all
the
*NL*
message
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
--
es
,
''
he
said
,
considering
.
``
Ye
--
es
.
Barkis
is
willin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
be
at
Blunderstone
again
to-morrow
,
Mr.
Barkis
,
''
I
said
,
*NL*
faltering
a
little
at
the
idea
of
my
being
far
away
from
it
then
,
``
and
*NL*
could
give
your
own
message
so
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
repudiated
this
suggestion
,
however
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
,
*NL*
and
once
more
confirmed
his
previous
request
by
saying
,
with
profound
*NL*
gravity
,
``
Barkis
is
willin
'
.
That
's
the
message
,
''
I
readily
undertook
*NL*
its
transmission
.
While
I
was
waiting
for
the
coach
in
the
hotel
*NL*
at
Yarmouth
that
very
afternoon
,
I
procured
a
sheet
of
paper
and
*NL*
an
inkstand
,
and
wrote
a
note
to
Peggotty
which
ran
thus
:
``
My
dear
*NL*
Peggotty
.
I
have
come
here
safe
.
Barkis
is
willing
.
My
love
to
mama
.
*NL*
Yours
affectionately
.
P.
S
.
He
says
he
particularly
wants
you
to
*NL*
know
--
_
Barkis
is
willing
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
taken
this
commission
on
myself
prospectively
,
Mr.
Barkis
*NL*
relapsed
into
perfect
silence
;
and
I
,
feeling
quite
worn
out
by
all
that
*NL*
had
happened
lately
,
lay
down
on
a
sack
in
the
cart
and
fell
asleep
.
I
*NL*
slept
soundly
until
we
got
to
Yarmouth
;
which
was
so
entirely
new
and
*NL*
strange
to
me
in
the
inn-yard
to
which
we
drove
,
that
I
at
once
*NL*
abandoned
a
latent
hope
I
had
had
of
meeting
with
some
of
Mr.
Peggotty
's
*NL*
family
there
,
perhaps
even
with
little
Em
`
ly
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
was
in
the
yard
,
shining
very
much
all
over
,
but
without
any
*NL*
horses
to
it
as
yet
;
and
it
looked
in
that
state
as
if
nothing
was
more
*NL*
unlikely
than
its
ever
going
to
London
.
I
was
thinking
this
,
and
*NL*
wondering
what
would
ultimately
become
of
my
box
,
which
Mr.
Barkis
had
*NL*
put
down
on
the
yard-pavement
by
the
pole
-LRB-
he
having
driven
up
the
yard
*NL*
to
turn
his
cart
-RRB-
,
and
also
what
would
ultimately
become
of
me
,
when
a
*NL*
lady
looked
out
of
a
bow-window
where
some
fowls
and
joints
of
meat
were
*NL*
hanging
up
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
little
gentleman
from
Blunderstone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
?
''
enquired
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
do
,
''
returned
the
lady
.
``
Nobody
's
dinner
is
paid
for
here
,
*NL*
in
that
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Murdstone
,
ma'am
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
Master
Murdstone
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
why
do
you
go
and
give
*NL*
another
name
,
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
to
the
lady
how
it
was
,
who
then
rang
a
bell
,
and
called
*NL*
out
,
``
William
!
show
the
coffee-room
!
''
upon
which
a
waiter
came
running
*NL*
out
of
a
kitchen
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
yard
to
show
it
,
and
seemed
*NL*
a
good
deal
surprised
when
he
found
he
was
only
to
show
it
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
large
long
room
with
some
large
maps
in
it
.
I
doubt
if
I
could
*NL*
have
felt
much
stranger
if
the
maps
had
been
real
foreign
countries
,
and
*NL*
I
cast
away
in
the
middle
of
them
.
I
felt
it
was
taking
a
liberty
to
sit
*NL*
down
,
with
my
cap
in
my
hand
,
on
the
corner
of
the
chair
nearest
the
*NL*
door
;
and
when
the
waiter
laid
a
cloth
on
purpose
for
me
,
and
put
a
set
*NL*
of
castors
on
it
,
I
think
I
must
have
turned
red
all
over
with
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
me
some
chops
,
and
vegetables
,
and
took
the
covers
off
in
*NL*
such
a
bouncing
manner
that
I
was
afraid
I
must
have
given
him
some
*NL*
offence
.
But
he
greatly
relieved
my
mind
by
putting
a
chair
for
me
at
*NL*
the
table
,
and
saying
,
very
affably
,
``
Now
,
six-foot
!
come
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
,
and
took
my
seat
at
the
board
;
but
found
it
extremely
*NL*
difficult
to
handle
my
knife
and
fork
with
anything
like
dexterity
,
or
*NL*
to
avoid
splashing
myself
with
the
gravy
,
while
he
was
standing
*NL*
opposite
,
staring
so
hard
,
and
making
me
blush
in
the
most
dreadful
*NL*
manner
every
time
I
caught
his
eye
.
After
watching
me
into
the
second
*NL*
chop
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
half
a
pint
of
ale
for
you
.
Will
you
have
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
,
and
said
``
Yes
.
''
Upon
which
he
poured
it
out
of
a
jug
into
*NL*
a
large
tumbler
,
and
held
it
up
against
the
light
,
and
made
it
look
*NL*
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
eye
!
''
he
said
.
``
It
seems
a
good
deal
,
do
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
seem
a
good
deal
,
''
I
answered
with
a
smile
.
For
it
was
quite
*NL*
delightful
to
me
,
to
find
him
so
pleasant
.
He
was
a
twinkling-eyed
,
*NL*
pimple-faced
man
,
with
his
hair
standing
upright
all
over
his
head
;
and
*NL*
as
he
stood
with
one
arm
a-kimbo
,
holding
up
the
glass
to
the
light
with
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
he
looked
quite
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
gentleman
here
,
yesterday
,
''
he
said
--
``
a
stout
gentleman
,
by
*NL*
the
name
of
Topsawyer
--
perhaps
you
know
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
do
n't
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
breeches
and
gaiters
,
broad-brimmed
hat
,
grey
coat
,
speckled
*NL*
choaker
,
''
said
the
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
bashfully
,
``
I
have
n't
the
pleasure
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
in
here
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
looking
at
the
light
through
the
*NL*
tumbler
,
``
ordered
a
glass
of
this
ale
--
_
would
_
order
it
--
I
told
him
*NL*
not
--
drank
it
,
and
fell
dead
.
It
was
too
old
for
him
.
It
ought
n't
to
be
*NL*
drawn
;
that
's
the
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
shocked
to
hear
of
this
melancholy
accident
,
and
said
I
*NL*
thought
I
had
better
have
some
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
you
see
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
still
looking
at
the
light
through
the
*NL*
tumbler
,
with
one
of
his
eyes
shut
up
,
``
our
people
do
n't
like
things
*NL*
being
ordered
and
left
.
It
offends
'em
.
But
_
I
_
'll
drink
it
,
if
you
*NL*
like
.
I
'm
used
to
it
,
and
use
is
everything
.
I
do
n't
think
it
'll
hurt
*NL*
me
,
if
I
throw
my
head
back
,
and
take
it
off
quick
.
Shall
I
?

*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

The
friendly
Waiter
and
I.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
he
would
much
oblige
me
by
drinking
it
,
if
he
thought
he
*NL*
could
do
it
safely
,
but
by
no
means
otherwise
.
When
he
did
throw
his
*NL*
head
back
,
and
take
it
off
quick
,
I
had
a
horrible
fear
,
I
confess
,
of
*NL*
seeing
him
meet
the
fate
of
the
lamented
Mr.
Topsawyer
,
and
fall
*NL*
lifeless
on
the
carpet
.
But
it
did
n't
hurt
him
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
*NL*
thought
he
seemed
the
fresher
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
we
got
here
?
''
he
said
,
putting
a
fork
into
my
dish
.
``
Not
*NL*
chops
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chops
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
I
did
n't
know
they
were
chops
.
Why
,
*NL*
a
chop
's
the
very
thing
to
take
off
the
bad
effects
of
that
beer
!
Ai
n't
*NL*
it
lucky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
took
a
chop
by
the
bone
in
one
hand
,
and
a
potato
in
the
other
,
*NL*
and
ate
away
with
a
very
good
appetite
,
to
my
extreme
satisfaction
.
He
*NL*
afterwards
took
another
chop
,
and
another
potato
;
and
after
that
,
*NL*
another
chop
and
another
potato
.
When
we
had
done
,
he
brought
me
a
*NL*
pudding
,
and
having
set
it
before
me
,
seemed
to
ruminate
,
and
to
become
*NL*
absent
in
his
mind
for
some
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
the
pie
?
''
he
said
,
rousing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pudding
,
''
I
made
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pudding
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Why
,
bless
me
,
so
it
is
!
What
!
''
looking
at
it
*NL*
nearer
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
it
's
a
batter-pudding
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
a
batter-pudding
,
''
he
said
,
taking
up
a
table-spoon
,
``
is
my
*NL*
favorite
pudding
!
Ai
n't
that
lucky
?
Come
on
,
little
`
un
,
and
let
's
see
*NL*
who
'll
get
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
certainly
got
most
.
He
entreated
me
more
than
once
to
come
in
*NL*
and
win
,
but
what
with
his
table-spoon
to
my
tea-spoon
,
his
dispatch
to
*NL*
my
dispatch
,
and
his
appetite
to
my
appetite
,
I
was
left
far
behind
at
*NL*
the
first
mouthful
,
and
had
no
chance
with
him
.
I
never
saw
any
one
*NL*
enjoy
a
pudding
so
much
,
I
think
;
and
he
laughed
,
when
it
was
all
gone
,
*NL*
as
if
his
enjoyment
of
it
lasted
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
him
so
very
friendly
and
companionable
,
it
was
then
that
I
asked
*NL*
for
the
pen
and
ink
and
paper
,
to
write
to
Peggotty
.
He
not
only
brought
*NL*
it
immediately
,
but
was
good
enough
to
look
over
me
while
I
wrote
the
*NL*
letter
.
When
I
had
finished
it
,
he
asked
me
where
I
was
going
to
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
``
Near
London
,
''
which
was
all
I
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
eye
!
''
he
said
,
looking
very
low-spirited
,
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
that
's
the
school
where
they
*NL*
broke
the
boy
's
ribs
--
two
ribs
--
a
little
boy
he
was
.
I
should
say
he
*NL*
was
--
let
me
see
--
how
old
are
you
,
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
between
eight
and
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
his
age
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
was
eight
years
and
six
months
old
*NL*
when
they
broke
his
first
rib
;
eight
years
and
eight
months
old
when
*NL*
they
broke
his
second
,
and
did
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
disguise
from
myself
,
or
from
the
waiter
,
that
this
was
an
*NL*
uncomfortable
coincidence
,
and
enquired
how
it
was
done
.
His
answer
was
*NL*
not
cheering
to
my
spirits
,
for
it
consisted
of
two
dismal
words
,
``
With
*NL*
whopping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blowing
of
the
coach-horn
in
the
yard
was
a
seasonable
diversion
,
*NL*
which
made
me
get
up
and
hesitatingly
enquire
,
in
the
mingled
pride
and
*NL*
diffidence
of
having
a
purse
-LRB-
which
I
took
out
of
my
pocket
-RRB-
,
if
there
*NL*
were
anything
to
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
sheet
of
letter-paper
,
''
he
returned
.
``
Did
you
ever
buy
a
*NL*
sheet
of
letter-paper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
remember
that
I
ever
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
dear
,
''
he
said
,
``
on
account
of
the
duty
.
Threepence
.
That
's
the
*NL*
way
we
're
taxed
in
this
country
.
There
's
nothing
else
,
except
the
*NL*
waiter
.
Never
mind
the
ink
.
_
I
_
lose
by
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
you
--
what
should
I
--
how
much
ought
I
to
--
what
would
it
be
*NL*
right
to
pay
the
waiter
,
if
you
please
?
''
I
stammered
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
n't
a
family
,
and
that
family
had
n't
the
cowpock
,
''
said
the
*NL*
waiter
,
``
I
would
n't
take
a
sixpence
.
If
I
did
n't
support
a
aged
pairint
,
*NL*
and
a
lovely
sister
,
''
--
here
the
waiter
was
greatly
agitated
--
``
I
would
n't
*NL*
take
a
farthing
.
If
I
had
a
good
place
,
and
was
treated
well
here
,
I
*NL*
should
beg
acceptance
of
a
trifle
,
instead
of
taking
of
it
.
But
I
live
*NL*
on
broken
wittles
--
and
I
sleep
on
the
coals
''
--
here
the
waiter
burst
into
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
concerned
for
his
misfortunes
,
and
felt
that
any
*NL*
recognition
short
of
ninepence
would
be
mere
brutality
and
hardness
of
*NL*
heart
.
Therefore
I
gave
him
one
of
my
three
bright
shillings
,
which
he
*NL*
received
with
much
humility
and
veneration
,
and
spun
up
with
his
thumb
,
*NL*
directly
afterwards
,
to
try
the
goodness
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
disconcerting
to
me
,
to
find
,
when
I
was
being
helped
up
*NL*
behind
the
coach
,
that
I
was
supposed
to
have
eaten
all
the
dinner
*NL*
without
any
assistance
.
I
discovered
this
,
from
overhearing
the
lady
in
*NL*
the
bow-window
,
say
to
the
guard
,
``
Take
care
of
that
child
,
George
,
or
*NL*
he
'll
burst
!
''
and
from
observing
that
the
women-servants
who
were
about
*NL*
the
place
came
out
to
look
and
giggle
at
me
as
a
young
phenomenon
.
My
*NL*
unfortunate
friend
the
waiter
,
who
had
quite
recovered
his
spirits
,
did
*NL*
not
appear
to
be
disturbed
by
this
,
but
joined
in
the
general
admiration
*NL*
without
being
at
all
confused
.
If
I
had
any
doubt
of
him
,
I
suppose
this
*NL*
half-awakened
it
;
but
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
with
the
simple
*NL*
confidence
of
a
child
,
and
the
natural
reliance
of
a
child
upon
superior
*NL*
years
-LRB-
qualities
I
am
very
sorry
any
children
should
prematurely
change
*NL*
for
worldly
wisdom
-RRB-
,
I
had
no
serious
mistrust
of
him
on
the
whole
,
even
*NL*
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
it
rather
hard
,
I
must
own
,
to
be
made
,
without
deserving
it
,
the
*NL*
subject
of
jokes
between
the
coachman
and
guard
as
to
the
coach
drawing
*NL*
heavy
behind
,
on
account
of
my
sitting
there
,
and
as
to
the
greater
*NL*
expediency
of
my
travelling
by
waggon
.
The
story
of
my
supposed
appetite
*NL*
getting
wind
among
the
outside
passengers
,
they
were
merry
upon
it
*NL*
likewise
;
and
asked
me
whether
I
was
going
to
be
paid
for
,
at
school
,
as
*NL*
two
brothers
or
three
,
and
whether
I
was
contracted
for
,
or
went
upon
*NL*
the
regular
terms
;
with
other
pleasant
questions
.
But
the
worst
of
it
*NL*
was
,
that
I
knew
I
should
be
ashamed
to
eat
anything
,
when
an
*NL*
opportunity
offered
,
and
that
,
after
a
rather
light
dinner
,
I
should
*NL*
remain
hungry
all
night
--
for
I
had
left
my
cakes
behind
,
at
the
hotel
,
*NL*
in
my
hurry
.
My
apprehensions
were
realised
.
When
we
stopped
for
supper
*NL*
I
could
n't
muster
courage
to
take
any
,
though
I
should
have
liked
it
*NL*
very
much
,
but
sat
by
the
fire
and
said
I
did
n't
want
anything
.
This
did
*NL*
not
save
me
from
more
jokes
,
either
;
for
a
husky-voiced
gentleman
with
a
*NL*
rough
face
,
who
had
been
eating
out
of
a
sandwich-box
nearly
all
the
*NL*
way
,
except
when
he
had
been
drinking
out
of
a
bottle
,
said
I
was
like
a
*NL*
boa
constrictor
who
took
enough
at
one
meal
to
last
him
a
long
time
;
*NL*
after
which
,
he
actually
brought
a
rash
out
upon
himself
with
boiled
*NL*
beef
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
started
from
Yarmouth
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
we
*NL*
were
due
in
London
about
eight
next
morning
.
It
was
Midsummer
weather
,
*NL*
and
the
evening
was
very
pleasant
.
When
we
passed
through
a
village
,
I
*NL*
pictured
to
myself
what
the
insides
of
the
houses
were
like
,
and
what
*NL*
the
inhabitants
were
about
;
and
when
boys
came
running
after
us
,
and
got
*NL*
up
behind
and
swung
there
for
a
little
way
,
I
wondered
whether
their
*NL*
fathers
were
alive
,
and
whether
they
were
happy
at
home
.
I
had
plenty
to
*NL*
think
of
,
therefore
,
besides
my
mind
running
continually
on
the
kind
of
*NL*
place
I
was
going
to
--
which
was
an
awful
speculation
.
Sometimes
,
I
*NL*
remember
,
I
resigned
myself
to
thoughts
of
home
and
Peggotty
;
and
to
*NL*
endeavouring
,
in
a
confused
blind
way
,
to
recall
how
I
had
felt
,
and
*NL*
what
sort
of
boy
I
used
to
be
,
before
I
bit
Mr.
Murdstone
:
which
I
*NL*
could
n't
satisfy
myself
about
by
any
means
,
I
seemed
to
have
bitten
him
*NL*
in
such
a
remote
antiquity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
not
so
pleasant
as
the
evening
,
for
it
got
chilly
;
and
*NL*
being
put
between
two
gentlemen
-LRB-
the
rough-faced
one
and
another
-RRB-
to
*NL*
prevent
my
tumbling
off
the
coach
,
I
was
nearly
smothered
by
their
*NL*
falling
asleep
,
and
completely
blocking
me
up
.
They
squeezed
me
so
hard
*NL*
sometimes
,
that
I
could
not
help
crying
out
,
``
Oh
!
If
you
please
!
''
--
which
*NL*
they
did
n't
like
at
all
,
because
it
woke
them
.
Opposite
me
was
an
*NL*
elderly
lady
in
a
great
fur
cloak
,
who
looked
in
the
dark
more
like
a
*NL*
haystack
than
a
lady
,
she
was
wrapped
up
to
such
a
degree
.
This
lady
had
*NL*
a
basket
with
her
,
and
she
had
n't
known
what
to
do
with
it
,
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
until
she
found
that
on
account
of
my
legs
being
short
,
it
could
*NL*
go
underneath
me
.
It
cramped
and
hurt
me
so
,
that
it
made
me
perfectly
*NL*
miserable
;
but
if
I
moved
in
the
least
,
and
made
a
glass
that
was
in
the
*NL*
basket
rattle
against
something
else
-LRB-
as
it
was
sure
to
do
-RRB-
,
she
gave
me
*NL*
the
cruellest
poke
with
her
foot
,
and
said
,
``
Come
,
do
n't
_
you
_
fidget
.
*NL*
_
Your
_
bones
are
young
enough
,
_
I
_
'm
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
sun
rose
,
and
then
my
companions
seemed
to
sleep
easier
.
The
*NL*
difficulties
under
which
they
had
laboured
all
night
,
and
which
had
*NL*
found
utterance
in
the
most
terrific
gasps
and
snorts
,
are
not
to
be
*NL*
conceived
.
As
the
sun
got
higher
,
their
sleep
became
lighter
,
and
so
*NL*
they
gradually
one
by
one
awoke
.
I
recollect
being
very
much
surprised
*NL*
by
the
feint
everybody
made
,
then
,
of
not
having
been
to
sleep
at
all
,
*NL*
and
by
the
uncommon
indignation
with
which
every
one
repelled
the
*NL*
charge
.
I
labor
under
the
same
kind
of
astonishment
to
this
day
,
having
*NL*
invariably
observed
that
of
all
human
weaknesses
,
the
one
to
which
our
*NL*
common
nature
is
the
least
disposed
to
confess
-LRB-
I
can
not
imagine
why
-RRB-
is
*NL*
the
weakness
of
having
gone
to
sleep
in
a
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
an
amazing
place
London
was
to
me
when
I
saw
it
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
and
how
I
believed
all
the
adventures
of
all
my
favorite
heroes
to
be
*NL*
constantly
enacting
and
re-enacting
there
,
and
how
I
vaguely
made
it
out
*NL*
in
my
own
mind
to
be
fuller
of
wonders
and
wickedness
than
all
the
*NL*
cities
of
the
earth
,
I
need
not
stop
here
to
relate
.
We
approached
it
by
*NL*
degrees
,
and
got
,
in
due
time
,
to
the
inn
in
the
Whitechapel
district
,
*NL*
for
which
we
were
bound
.
I
forget
whether
it
was
the
Blue
Bull
,
or
the
*NL*
Blue
Boar
;
but
I
know
it
was
the
Blue
Something
,
and
that
its
likeness
*NL*
was
painted
up
on
the
back
of
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guard
's
eye
lighted
on
me
as
he
was
getting
down
,
and
he
said
at
the
*NL*
booking-office
door
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anybody
here
for
a
yoongster
booked
in
the
name
of
Murdstone
,
*NL*
from
Bloonderstone
,
Sooffolk
,
to
be
left
till
called
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
Copperfield
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
looking
helplessly
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anybody
here
for
a
yoongster
,
booked
in
the
name
of
Murdstone
,
*NL*
from
Bloonderstone
,
Sooffolk
,
but
owning
to
the
name
of
Copperfield
,
to
*NL*
be
left
till
called
for
?
''
said
the
guard
.
``
Come
!
_
Is
_
there
anybody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
There
was
nobody
.
I
looked
anxiously
around
;
but
the
enquiry
made
no
*NL*
impression
on
any
of
the
bystanders
,
if
I
except
a
man
in
gaiters
,
with
*NL*
one
eye
,
who
suggested
that
they
had
better
put
a
brass
collar
round
my
*NL*
neck
,
and
tie
me
up
in
the
stable
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ladder
was
brought
,
and
I
got
down
after
the
lady
,
who
was
like
a
*NL*
haystack
:
not
daring
to
stir
,
until
her
basket
was
removed
.
The
coach
*NL*
was
clear
of
passengers
by
that
time
,
the
luggage
was
very
soon
cleared
*NL*
out
,
the
horses
had
been
taken
out
before
the
luggage
,
and
now
the
coach
*NL*
itself
was
wheeled
and
backed
off
by
some
hostlers
,
out
of
the
way
.
*NL*
Still
,
nobody
appeared
,
to
claim
the
dusty
youngster
from
Blunderstone
,
*NL*
Suffolk
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
solitary
than
Robinson
Crusoe
,
who
had
nobody
to
look
at
him
and
*NL*
see
that
he
was
solitary
,
I
went
into
the
booking-office
,
and
,
by
*NL*
invitation
of
the
clerk
on
duty
,
passed
behind
the
counter
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
on
the
scale
at
which
they
weighed
the
luggage
.
Here
,
as
I
sat
looking
*NL*
at
the
parcels
,
packages
,
and
books
,
and
inhaling
the
smell
of
stables
*NL*
-LRB-
ever
since
associated
with
that
morning
-RRB-
,
a
procession
of
most
*NL*
tremendous
considerations
began
to
march
through
my
mind
.
Supposing
*NL*
nobody
should
ever
fetch
me
,
how
long
would
they
consent
to
keep
me
*NL*
there
?
Would
they
keep
me
long
enough
to
spend
seven
shillings
?
Should
I
*NL*
sleep
at
night
in
one
of
those
wooden
binns
with
the
other
luggage
,
and
*NL*
wash
myself
at
the
pump
in
the
yard
in
the
morning
;
or
should
I
be
*NL*
turned
out
every
night
,
and
expected
to
come
again
to
be
left
till
*NL*
called
for
,
when
the
office
opened
next
day
?
Supposing
there
was
no
*NL*
mistake
in
the
case
,
and
Mr.
Murdstone
had
devised
this
plan
to
get
rid
*NL*
of
me
,
what
should
I
do
?
If
they
allowed
me
to
remain
there
until
my
*NL*
seven
shillings
were
spent
,
I
could
n't
hope
to
remain
there
when
I
began
*NL*
to
starve
.
That
would
obviously
be
inconvenient
and
unpleasant
to
the
*NL*
customers
,
besides
entailing
on
the
Blue
Whatever-it-was
,
the
risk
of
*NL*
funeral
expenses
.
If
I
started
off
at
once
,
and
tried
to
walk
back
home
,
*NL*
how
could
I
ever
find
my
way
,
how
could
I
ever
hope
to
walk
so
far
,
how
*NL*
could
I
make
sure
of
any
one
but
Peggotty
,
even
if
I
got
back
?
If
I
*NL*
found
out
the
nearest
proper
authorities
,
and
offered
myself
to
go
for
a
*NL*
soldier
,
or
a
sailor
,
I
was
such
a
little
fellow
that
it
was
most
likely
*NL*
they
would
n't
take
me
in
.
These
thoughts
,
and
a
hundred
other
such
*NL*
thoughts
,
turned
me
burning
hot
,
and
made
me
giddy
with
apprehension
and
*NL*
dismay
.
I
was
in
the
height
of
my
fever
when
a
man
entered
and
whispered
*NL*
to
the
clerk
,
who
presently
slanted
me
off
the
scale
,
and
pushed
me
over
*NL*
to
him
,
as
if
I
were
weighed
,
bought
,
delivered
,
and
paid
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
went
out
of
the
office
,
hand
in
hand
with
this
new
acquaintance
,
*NL*
I
stole
a
look
at
him
.
He
was
a
gaunt
,
sallow
young
man
,
with
hollow
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
a
chin
almost
as
black
as
Mr.
Murdstone
's
;
but
there
the
*NL*
likeness
ended
,
for
his
whiskers
were
shaved
off
,
and
his
hair
,
instead
*NL*
of
being
glossy
,
was
rusty
and
dry
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
black
*NL*
clothes
which
were
rather
rusty
and
dry
too
,
and
rather
short
in
the
*NL*
sleeves
and
legs
;
and
he
had
a
white
neck-kerchief
on
that
was
not
*NL*
over-clean
.
I
did
not
,
and
do
not
,
suppose
that
this
neck-kerchief
was
*NL*
all
the
linen
he
wore
,
but
it
was
all
he
showed
or
gave
any
hint
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
the
new
boy
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
supposed
I
was
.
I
did
n't
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
one
of
the
masters
at
Salem
House
,
''
_
he
_
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
him
a
bow
and
felt
very
much
overawed
.
I
was
so
ashamed
to
allude
*NL*
to
a
common-place
thing
like
my
box
,
to
a
scholar
and
a
master
at
Salem
*NL*
House
,
that
we
had
gone
some
little
distance
from
the
yard
before
I
had
*NL*
the
hardihood
to
mention
it
.
We
turned
back
,
on
my
humbly
insinuating
*NL*
that
it
might
be
useful
to
me
hereafter
;
and
he
told
the
clerk
that
the
*NL*
carrier
had
instructions
to
call
for
it
at
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
when
we
had
accomplished
about
the
same
*NL*
distance
as
before
,
``
is
it
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
down
by
Blackheath
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
_
that
_
far
,
sir
?
''
I
diffidently
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
step
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
shall
go
by
the
stage-coach
.
It
's
about
*NL*
six
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
faint
and
tired
,
that
the
idea
of
holding
out
for
six
miles
*NL*
more
,
was
too
much
for
me
.
I
took
heart
to
tell
him
that
I
had
had
*NL*
nothing
all
night
,
and
that
if
he
would
allow
me
to
buy
something
to
*NL*
eat
,
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
.
He
appeared
surprised
at
*NL*
this
--
I
see
him
stop
and
look
at
me
now
--
and
after
considering
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
said
he
wanted
to
call
on
an
old
person
who
lived
not
*NL*
far
off
,
and
that
the
best
way
would
be
for
me
to
buy
some
bread
,
or
*NL*
whatever
I
liked
best
that
was
wholesome
,
and
make
my
breakfast
at
her
*NL*
house
,
where
we
could
get
some
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
we
looked
in
at
a
baker
's
window
,
and
after
I
had
made
a
*NL*
series
of
proposals
to
buy
everything
that
was
bilious
in
the
shop
,
and
*NL*
he
had
rejected
them
one
by
one
,
we
decided
in
favour
of
a
nice
little
*NL*
loaf
of
brown
bread
,
which
cost
me
threepence
.
Then
,
at
a
grocer
's
shop
,
*NL*
we
bought
an
egg
and
a
slice
of
streaky
bacon
;
which
still
left
what
I
*NL*
thought
a
good
deal
of
change
,
out
of
the
second
of
the
bright
*NL*
shillings
,
and
made
me
consider
London
a
very
cheap
place
.
These
*NL*
provisions
laid
in
,
we
went
on
through
a
great
noise
and
uproar
that
*NL*
confused
my
weary
head
beyond
description
,
and
over
a
bridge
which
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
was
London
Bridge
-LRB-
indeed
I
think
he
told
me
so
,
but
I
was
half
*NL*
asleep
-RRB-
,
until
we
came
to
the
poor
person
's
house
,
which
was
a
part
of
*NL*
some
alms-houses
,
as
I
knew
by
their
look
,
and
by
an
inscription
on
a
*NL*
stone
over
the
gate
,
which
said
they
were
established
for
twenty-five
*NL*
poor
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Master
at
Salem
House
lifted
the
latch
of
one
of
a
number
of
little
*NL*
black
doors
that
were
all
alike
,
and
had
each
a
little
diamond-paned
*NL*
window
on
one
side
,
and
another
little
diamond-paned
window
above
;
and
*NL*
we
went
into
the
little
house
of
one
of
these
poor
old
women
,
who
was
*NL*
blowing
a
fire
to
make
a
little
saucepan
boil
.
On
seeing
the
master
*NL*
enter
,
the
old
woman
stopped
with
the
bellows
on
her
knee
,
and
said
*NL*
something
that
I
thought
sounded
like
``
My
Charley
!
''
but
on
seeing
me
*NL*
come
in
too
,
she
got
up
,
and
rubbing
her
hands
made
a
confused
sort
of
*NL*
half
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
cook
this
young
gentleman
's
breakfast
for
him
,
if
you
please
?
''
*NL*
said
the
Master
at
Salem
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
?
''
said
the
old
woman
.
``
Yes
can
I
,
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
Mrs.
Fibbitson
to-day
?
''
said
the
Master
,
looking
at
another
old
*NL*
woman
in
a
large
chair
by
the
fire
,
who
was
such
a
bundle
of
clothes
*NL*
that
I
feel
grateful
to
this
hour
for
not
having
sat
upon
her
by
*NL*
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
's
poorly
,
''
said
the
first
old
woman
.
``
It
's
one
of
her
bad
days
.
*NL*
If
the
fire
was
to
go
out
,
through
any
accident
,
I
verily
believe
she
'd
*NL*
go
out
too
,
and
never
come
to
life
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
looked
at
her
,
I
looked
at
her
also
.
Although
it
was
a
warm
day
,
*NL*
she
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
fire
.
I
fancied
she
was
jealous
*NL*
even
of
the
saucepan
on
it
;
and
I
have
reason
to
know
that
she
took
its
*NL*
impressment
into
the
service
of
boiling
my
egg
and
broiling
my
bacon
,
in
*NL*
dudgeon
;
for
I
saw
her
,
with
my
own
discomfited
eyes
,
shake
her
fist
at
*NL*
me
once
,
when
those
culinary
operations
were
going
on
,
and
no
one
else
*NL*
was
looking
.
The
sun
streamed
in
at
the
little
window
,
but
she
sat
with
*NL*
her
own
back
and
the
back
of
the
large
chair
towards
it
,
screening
the
*NL*
fire
as
if
she
were
sedulously
keeping
_
it
_
warm
,
instead
of
it
keeping
*NL*
her
warm
,
and
watching
it
in
a
most
distrustful
manner
.
The
completion
*NL*
of
the
preparations
for
my
breakfast
,
by
relieving
the
fire
,
gave
her
*NL*
such
extreme
joy
that
she
laughed
aloud
--
and
a
very
unmelodious
laugh
*NL*
she
had
,
I
must
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
to
my
brown
loaf
,
my
egg
,
and
my
rasher
of
bacon
,
with
a
*NL*
bason
of
milk
besides
,
and
made
a
most
delicious
meal
.
While
I
was
yet
*NL*
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
,
the
old
woman
of
the
house
said
to
the
*NL*
Master
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
your
flute
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
blow
at
it
,
''
said
the
old
woman
,
coaxingly
.
``
Do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Master
,
upon
this
,
put
his
hand
underneath
the
skirts
of
his
coat
,
*NL*
and
brought
out
his
flute
in
three
pieces
,
which
he
screwed
together
,
*NL*
and
began
immediately
to
play
.
My
impression
is
,
after
many
years
of
*NL*
consideration
,
that
there
never
can
have
been
anybody
in
the
world
*NL*
who
played
worse
.
He
made
the
most
dismal
sounds
I
have
ever
heard
*NL*
produced
by
any
means
,
natural
or
artificial
.
I
do
n't
know
what
the
*NL*
tunes
were
--
if
there
were
such
things
in
the
performance
at
all
,
which
*NL*
I
doubt
--
but
the
influence
of
the
strain
upon
me
was
,
first
,
to
make
*NL*
me
think
of
all
my
sorrows
until
I
could
hardly
keep
my
tears
back
;
*NL*
then
to
take
away
my
appetite
;
and
lastly
to
make
me
so
sleepy
that
*NL*
I
could
n't
keep
my
eyes
open
.
They
begin
to
close
again
,
and
I
begin
*NL*
to
nod
,
as
the
recollection
rises
fresh
upon
me
.
Once
more
the
little
*NL*
room
with
its
open
corner
cupboard
,
and
its
square-backed
chairs
,
and
*NL*
its
angular
little
staircase
leading
to
the
room
above
,
and
its
three
*NL*
peacock
's
feathers
displayed
over
the
mantelpiece
--
I
remember
wondering
*NL*
when
I
first
went
in
,
what
that
peacock
would
have
thought
if
he
had
*NL*
known
what
his
finery
was
doomed
to
come
to
--
fades
from
before
me
,
and
*NL*
I
nod
,
and
sleep
.
The
flute
becomes
inaudible
,
the
wheels
of
the
coach
*NL*
are
heard
instead
,
and
I
am
on
my
journey
.
The
coach
jolts
,
I
wake
with
*NL*
a
start
,
and
the
flute
has
come
back
again
,
and
the
Master
at
Salem
*NL*
House
is
sitting
with
his
legs
crossed
,
playing
it
dolefully
,
while
the
*NL*
old
woman
of
the
house
looks
on
delighted
.
She
fades
in
her
turn
,
and
*NL*
he
fades
,
and
all
fades
,
and
there
is
no
flute
,
no
Master
,
no
Salem
*NL*
House
,
no
David
Copperfield
,
no
anything
but
heavy
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dreamed
,
I
thought
,
that
once
while
he
was
blowing
into
this
dismal
*NL*
flute
,
the
old
woman
of
the
house
,
who
had
gone
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
*NL*
in
her
ecstatic
admiration
,
leaned
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
gave
*NL*
him
an
affectionate
squeeze
round
the
neck
,
which
stopped
his
playing
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
I
was
in
the
middle
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
*NL*
either
then
or
immediately
afterwards
;
for
,
as
he
resumed
--
it
was
a
real
*NL*
fact
that
he
had
stopped
playing
--
I
saw
and
heard
the
same
old
woman
ask
*NL*
Mrs.
Fibbitson
if
it
was
n't
delicious
-LRB-
meaning
the
flute
-RRB-
,
to
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Fibbitson
replied
,
``
Ay
,
ay
!
Yes
!
''
and
nodded
at
the
fire
:
to
which
,
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
,
she
gave
the
credit
of
the
whole
performance
.

*NL*
When
I
seemed
to
have
been
dozing
a
long
while
,
the
Master
at
Salem
*NL*
House
unscrewed
his
flute
into
the
three
pieces
,
put
them
up
as
before
,
*NL*
and
took
me
away
.
We
found
the
coach
very
near
at
hand
,
and
got
upon
the
*NL*
roof
;
but
I
was
so
dead
sleepy
,
that
when
we
stopped
on
the
road
to
take
*NL*
up
somebody
else
,
they
put
me
inside
where
there
were
no
passengers
,
and
*NL*
where
I
slept
profoundly
,
until
I
found
the
coach
going
at
a
footpace
up
*NL*
a
steep
hill
among
green
leaves
.
Presently
,
it
stopped
,
and
had
come
to
*NL*
its
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
walk
brought
us
--
I
mean
the
Master
and
me
--
to
Salem
House
,
which
*NL*
was
enclosed
with
a
high
brick
wall
,
and
looked
very
dull
.
Over
a
door
*NL*
in
this
wall
was
a
board
with
SALEM
HOUSE
upon
it
;
and
through
a
grating
*NL*
in
this
door
we
were
surveyed
when
we
rang
the
bell
by
a
surly
face
,
*NL*
which
I
found
,
on
the
door
being
opened
,
belonged
to
a
stout
man
with
a
*NL*
bull-neck
,
a
wooden
leg
,
overhanging
temples
,
and
his
hair
cut
close
all
*NL*
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
new
boy
,
''
said
the
Master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
with
the
wooden
leg
eyed
me
all
over
--
it
did
n't
take
long
,
for
*NL*
there
was
not
much
of
me
--
and
locked
the
gate
behind
us
,
and
took
out
*NL*
the
key
.
We
were
going
up
to
the
house
,
among
some
dark
heavy
trees
,
*NL*
when
he
called
after
my
conductor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
back
,
and
he
was
standing
at
the
door
of
a
little
lodge
,
where
*NL*
he
lived
,
with
a
pair
of
boots
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
The
cobbler
's
been
,
''
he
said
,
``
since
you
've
been
out
,
Mr.
Mell
,
*NL*
and
he
says
he
ca
n't
mend
'em
any
more
.
He
says
there
a
n't
a
bit
of
the
*NL*
original
boot
left
,
and
he
wonders
you
expect
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
he
threw
the
boots
towards
Mr.
Mell
,
who
went
back
a
*NL*
few
paces
to
pick
them
up
,
and
looked
at
them
-LRB-
very
disconsolately
,
I
*NL*
was
afraid
-RRB-
,
as
we
went
on
together
.
I
observed
then
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
that
the
boots
he
had
on
were
a
good
deal
the
worse
for
wear
,
and
*NL*
that
his
stocking
was
just
breaking
out
in
one
place
,
like
a
bud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Salem
House
was
a
square
brick
building
with
wings
;
of
a
bare
and
*NL*
unfurnished
appearance
.
All
about
it
was
so
very
quiet
,
that
I
said
*NL*
to
Mr.
Mell
I
supposed
the
boys
were
out
;
but
he
seemed
surprised
*NL*
at
my
not
knowing
that
it
was
holiday-time
.
That
all
the
boys
were
*NL*
at
their
several
homes
.
That
Mr.
Creakle
,
the
proprietor
,
was
down
*NL*
by
the
sea-side
with
Mrs.
and
Miss
Creakle
;
and
that
I
was
sent
in
*NL*
holiday-time
as
a
punishment
for
my
misdoing
,
all
of
which
he
explained
*NL*
to
me
as
we
went
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gazed
upon
the
schoolroom
into
which
he
took
me
,
as
the
most
forlorn
*NL*
and
desolate
place
I
had
ever
seen
.
I
see
it
now
.
A
long
room
with
three
*NL*
long
rows
of
desks
,
and
six
of
forms
,
and
bristling
all
round
with
pegs
*NL*
for
hats
and
slates
.
Scraps
of
old
copybooks
and
exercises
,
litter
the
*NL*
dirty
floor
.
Some
silkworms
'
houses
,
made
of
the
same
materials
,
are
*NL*
scattered
over
the
desks
.
Two
miserable
little
white
mice
,
left
behind
*NL*
by
their
owner
,
are
running
up
and
down
in
a
fusty
castle
made
of
*NL*
pasteboard
and
wire
,
looking
in
all
the
corners
with
their
red
eyes
for
*NL*
anything
to
eat
.
A
bird
,
in
a
cage
a
very
little
bigger
than
himself
,
*NL*
makes
a
mournful
rattle
now
and
then
in
hopping
on
his
perch
,
two
inches
*NL*
high
,
or
dropping
from
it
;
but
neither
sings
nor
chirps
.
There
is
a
*NL*
strange
unwholesome
smell
upon
the
room
,
like
mildewed
corduroys
,
sweet
*NL*
apples
wanting
air
,
and
rotten
books
.
There
could
not
well
be
more
ink
*NL*
splashed
about
it
,
if
it
had
been
roofless
from
its
first
construction
,
*NL*
and
the
skies
had
rained
,
snowed
,
hailed
,
and
blown
ink
through
the
*NL*
varying
seasons
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Mell
having
left
me
while
he
took
his
irreparable
boots
up-stairs
,
I
*NL*
went
softly
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
observing
all
this
as
I
crept
*NL*
along
.
Suddenly
I
came
upon
a
pasteboard
placard
,
beautifully
written
,
*NL*
which
was
lying
on
the
desk
,
and
bore
these
words
--
''
_
Take
care
of
him
.
*NL*
He
bites
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
upon
the
desk
immediately
,
apprehensive
of
at
least
a
great
dog
*NL*
underneath
.
But
,
though
I
looked
all
round
with
anxious
eyes
,
I
could
*NL*
see
nothing
of
him
.
I
was
still
engaged
in
peering
about
,
when
Mr.
Mell
*NL*
came
back
,
and
asked
me
what
I
did
up
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
says
I
,
``
if
you
please
,
I
'm
looking
for
the
*NL*
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dog
?
''
says
he
.
``
What
dog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
a
dog
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
what
a
dog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
to
be
taken
care
of
,
sir
;
that
bites
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Copperfield
,
''
says
he
gravely
,
``
that
's
not
a
dog
.
That
's
a
boy
.
My
*NL*
instructions
are
,
Copperfield
,
to
put
this
placard
on
your
back
.
I
am
*NL*
sorry
to
make
such
a
beginning
with
you
,
but
I
must
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
he
took
me
down
,
and
tied
the
placard
,
which
was
neatly
*NL*
constructed
for
the
purpose
,
on
my
shoulders
like
a
knapsack
;
and
*NL*
wherever
I
went
,
afterwards
,
I
had
the
consolation
of
carrying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
suffered
from
that
placard
,
nobody
can
imagine
.
Whether
it
was
*NL*
possible
for
people
to
see
me
or
not
,
I
always
fancied
that
somebody
was
*NL*
reading
it
.
It
was
no
relief
to
turn
round
and
find
nobody
;
for
wherever
*NL*
my
back
was
,
there
I
imagined
somebody
always
to
be
.
That
cruel
man
with
*NL*
the
wooden
leg
,
aggravated
my
sufferings
.
He
was
in
authority
;
and
if
he
*NL*
ever
saw
me
leaning
against
a
tree
,
or
a
wall
,
or
the
house
,
he
roared
*NL*
out
from
his
lodge-door
in
a
stupendous
voice
,
``
Hallo
,
you
sir
!
You
*NL*
Copperfield
!
Show
that
badge
conspicuous
,
or
I
'll
report
you
!
''
The
*NL*
playground
was
a
bare
gravelled
yard
,
open
to
all
the
back
of
the
house
*NL*
and
the
offices
;
and
I
knew
that
the
servants
read
it
,
and
the
butcher
*NL*
read
it
,
and
the
baker
read
it
;
that
everybody
,
in
a
word
,
who
came
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
house
,
of
a
morning
when
I
was
ordered
to
*NL*
walk
there
,
read
that
I
was
to
be
taken
care
of
,
for
I
bit
.
I
recollect
*NL*
that
I
positively
began
to
have
a
dread
of
myself
,
as
a
kind
of
wild
boy
*NL*
who
did
bite
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
old
door
in
this
playground
,
on
which
the
boys
had
a
custom
*NL*
of
carving
their
names
.
It
was
completely
covered
with
such
*NL*
inscriptions
.
In
my
dread
of
the
end
of
the
vacation
and
their
coming
*NL*
back
,
I
could
not
read
a
boy
's
name
,
without
enquiring
in
what
tone
and
*NL*
with
what
emphasis
_
he
_
would
read
,
``
Take
care
of
him
.
He
bites
.
''
There
*NL*
was
one
boy
--
a
certain
J.
Steerforth
--
who
cut
his
name
very
deep
and
*NL*
very
often
,
who
,
I
conceived
,
would
read
it
in
a
rather
strong
voice
,
*NL*
and
afterwards
pull
my
hair
.
There
was
another
boy
,
one
Tommy
Traddles
,
*NL*
who
I
dreaded
would
make
game
of
it
,
and
pretend
to
be
dreadfully
*NL*
frightened
of
me
.
There
was
a
third
,
George
Demple
,
who
I
fancied
would
*NL*
sing
it
.
I
have
looked
,
a
little
shrinking
creature
,
at
that
door
,
until
*NL*
the
owners
of
all
the
names
--
there
were
five-and-forty
of
them
in
the
*NL*
school
then
,
Mr.
Mell
said
--
seemed
to
send
me
to
Coventry
by
general
*NL*
acclamation
,
and
to
cry
out
,
each
in
his
own
way
,
``
Take
care
of
him
.
He
*NL*
bites
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
with
the
places
at
the
desks
and
forms
.
It
was
the
same
*NL*
with
the
groves
of
deserted
bedsteads
I
peeped
at
,
on
my
way
to
,
and
*NL*
when
I
was
in
,
my
own
bed
.
I
remember
dreaming
night
after
night
,
of
*NL*
being
with
my
mother
as
she
used
to
be
,
or
of
going
to
a
party
at
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
's
,
or
of
travelling
outside
the
stage-coach
,
or
of
dining
again
*NL*
with
my
unfortunate
friend
the
waiter
,
and
in
all
these
circumstances
*NL*
making
people
scream
and
stare
,
by
the
unhappy
disclosure
that
I
had
*NL*
nothing
on
but
my
little
night-shirt
,
and
that
placard
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
monotony
of
my
life
,
and
in
my
constant
apprehension
of
the
*NL*
reopening
of
the
school
,
it
was
such
an
insupportable
affliction
!
I
had
*NL*
long
tasks
every
day
to
do
with
Mr.
Mell
;
but
I
did
them
,
there
being
no
*NL*
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
here
,
and
got
through
them
without
disgrace
.
*NL*
Before
,
and
after
them
,
I
walked
about
--
supervised
,
as
I
have
mentioned
,
*NL*
by
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
How
vividly
I
call
to
mind
the
damp
*NL*
about
the
house
,
the
green
cracked
flagstones
in
the
court
,
an
old
leaky
*NL*
water-butt
,
and
the
discolored
trunks
of
some
of
the
grim
trees
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
dripped
more
in
the
rain
than
other
trees
,
and
to
have
*NL*
blown
less
in
the
sun
!
At
one
we
dined
,
Mr.
Mell
and
I
,
at
the
upper
end
*NL*
of
a
long
bare
dining-room
,
full
of
deal
tables
,
and
smelling
of
fat
.
*NL*
Then
,
we
had
more
tasks
until
tea
,
which
Mr.
Mell
drank
out
of
a
blue
*NL*
teacup
,
and
I
out
of
a
tin
pot
.
All
day
long
,
and
until
seven
or
eight
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
Mr.
Mell
,
at
his
own
detached
desk
in
the
schoolroom
,
*NL*
worked
hard
with
pen
,
ink
,
ruler
,
books
,
and
writing-paper
,
making
out
*NL*
the
bills
-LRB-
as
I
found
-RRB-
for
last
half-year
.
When
he
had
put
up
his
things
*NL*
for
the
night
he
took
out
his
flute
,
and
blew
at
it
,
until
I
almost
*NL*
thought
he
would
gradually
blow
his
whole
being
into
the
large
hole
at
*NL*
the
top
,
and
ooze
away
at
the
keys
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
picture
my
small
self
in
the
dimly-lighted
rooms
,
sitting
with
my
head
*NL*
upon
my
hand
,
listening
to
the
doleful
performance
of
Mr.
Mell
,
and
*NL*
conning
to-morrow
's
lessons
.
I
picture
myself
with
my
books
shut
up
,
*NL*
still
listening
to
the
doleful
performance
of
Mr.
Mell
,
and
listening
*NL*
through
it
to
what
used
to
be
at
home
,
and
to
the
blowing
of
the
wind
on
*NL*
Yarmouth
flats
,
and
feeling
very
sad
and
solitary
.
I
picture
myself
*NL*
going
up
to
bed
,
among
the
unused
rooms
,
and
sitting
on
my
bed-side
*NL*
crying
for
a
comfortable
word
from
Peggotty
.
I
picture
myself
coming
*NL*
down
stairs
in
the
morning
,
and
looking
through
a
long
ghastly
gash
of
a
*NL*
staircase-window
,
at
the
school-bell
hanging
on
the
top
of
an
outhouse
,
*NL*
with
a
weathercock
above
it
;
and
dreading
the
time
when
it
shall
ring
J.
*NL*
Steerforth
and
the
rest
to
work
:
which
is
only
second
,
in
my
foreboding
*NL*
apprehensions
,
to
the
time
when
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
shall
unlock
*NL*
the
rusty
gate
to
give
admission
to
the
awful
Mr.
Creakle
.
I
can
not
*NL*
think
I
was
a
very
dangerous
character
in
any
of
these
aspects
,
but
in
*NL*
all
of
them
I
carried
the
same
warning
on
my
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Mell
never
said
much
to
me
,
but
he
was
never
harsh
to
me
.
I
suppose
*NL*
we
were
company
to
each
other
,
without
talking
.
I
forgot
to
mention
that
*NL*
he
would
talk
to
himself
sometimes
,
and
grin
,
and
clench
his
fist
,
and
*NL*
grind
his
teeth
,
and
pull
his
hair
in
an
unaccountable
manner
.
But
he
*NL*
had
these
peculiarities
:
and
at
first
they
frightened
me
,
though
I
soon
*NL*
got
used
to
them
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ENLARGE
MY
CIRCLE
OF
ACQUAINTANCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
led
this
life
about
a
month
,
when
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
*NL*
began
to
stump
about
with
a
mop
and
a
bucket
of
water
,
from
which
I
*NL*
inferred
that
preparations
were
making
to
receive
Mr.
Creakle
and
the
*NL*
boys
.
I
was
not
mistaken
;
for
the
mop
came
into
the
schoolroom
before
*NL*
long
,
and
turned
out
Mr.
Mell
and
me
,
who
lived
where
we
could
,
and
got
*NL*
on
how
we
could
,
for
some
days
,
during
which
we
were
always
in
the
way
*NL*
of
two
or
three
young
women
,
who
had
rarely
shown
themselves
before
,
and
*NL*
were
so
continually
in
the
midst
of
dust
that
I
sneezed
almost
as
much
*NL*
as
if
Salem
House
had
been
a
great
snuff-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
I
was
informed
by
Mr.
Mell
,
that
Mr.
Creakle
would
be
home
that
*NL*
evening
.
In
the
evening
,
after
tea
,
I
heard
that
he
was
come
.
Before
*NL*
bed-time
,
I
was
fetched
by
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
to
appear
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
's
part
of
the
house
was
a
good
deal
more
comfortable
than
*NL*
ours
,
and
he
had
a
snug
bit
of
garden
that
looked
pleasant
after
the
*NL*
dusty
playground
,
which
was
such
a
desert
in
miniature
,
that
I
thought
*NL*
no
one
but
a
camel
,
or
a
dromedary
,
could
have
felt
at
home
in
it
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
me
a
bold
thing
even
to
take
notice
that
the
passage
looked
*NL*
comfortable
,
as
I
went
on
my
way
,
trembling
,
to
Mr.
Creakle
's
presence
:
*NL*
which
so
abashed
me
,
when
I
was
ushered
into
it
,
that
I
hardly
saw
Mrs.
*NL*
Creakle
or
Miss
Creakle
-LRB-
who
were
both
there
,
in
the
parlor
-RRB-
,
or
*NL*
anything
but
Mr.
Creakle
,
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
bunch
of
watch-chain
*NL*
and
seals
,
in
an
arm-chair
,
with
a
tumbler
and
bottle
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
This
is
the
young
gentleman
whose
teeth
are
to
*NL*
be
filed
!
Turn
him
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wooden-legged
man
turned
me
about
so
as
to
exhibit
the
placard
;
and
*NL*
having
afforded
time
for
a
full
survey
of
it
,
turned
me
about
again
,
*NL*
with
my
face
to
Mr.
Creakle
,
and
posted
himself
at
Mr.
Creakle
's
side
.
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
's
face
was
fiery
,
and
his
eyes
were
small
,
and
deep
in
his
*NL*
head
;
he
had
thick
veins
in
his
forehead
,
a
little
nose
,
and
a
large
*NL*
chin
.
He
was
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
;
and
had
some
thin
wet-looking
*NL*
hair
that
was
just
turning
grey
,
brushed
across
each
temple
,
so
that
the
*NL*
two
sides
interlaced
on
his
forehead
.
But
the
circumstance
about
him
*NL*
which
impressed
me
most
,
was
,
that
he
had
no
voice
,
but
spoke
in
a
*NL*
whisper
.
The
exertion
this
cost
him
,
or
the
consciousness
of
talking
in
*NL*
that
feeble
way
,
made
his
angry
face
so
much
more
angry
,
and
his
thick
*NL*
veins
so
much
thicker
,
when
he
spoke
,
that
I
am
not
surprised
,
on
*NL*
looking
back
,
at
this
peculiarity
striking
me
as
his
chief
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
What
's
the
report
of
this
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
against
him
yet
,
''
returned
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
*NL*
``
There
has
been
no
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Mr.
Creakle
was
disappointed
.
I
thought
Mrs.
and
Miss
Creakle
*NL*
-LRB-
at
whom
I
now
glanced
for
the
first
time
,
and
who
were
,
both
,
thin
and
*NL*
quiet
-RRB-
were
not
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
sir
!
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
beckoning
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
!
''
said
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
repeating
the
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
happiness
of
knowing
your
father-in-law
,
''
whispered
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
,
taking
me
by
the
ear
;
``
and
a
worthy
man
he
is
,
and
a
man
of
a
*NL*
strong
character
.
He
knows
me
,
and
I
know
him
.
Do
_
you
_
know
me
?
Hey
?
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
pinching
my
ear
with
ferocious
playfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
flinching
with
the
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
?
Hey
?
''
repeated
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
But
you
will
soon
.
Hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
soon
.
Hey
?
''
repeated
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
I
afterwards
*NL*
found
that
he
generally
acted
,
with
his
strong
voice
,
as
Mr.
Creakle
's
*NL*
interpreter
to
the
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
frightened
,
and
said
,
I
hoped
so
,
if
he
pleased
.
I
felt
,
*NL*
all
this
while
,
as
if
my
ear
were
blazing
;
he
pinched
it
so
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
am
,
''
whispered
Mr.
Creakle
,
letting
it
go
at
last
,
*NL*
with
a
screw
at
parting
that
brought
the
water
into
my
eyes
.
``
I
'm
a
*NL*
Tartar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Tartar
,
''
said
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
say
I
'll
do
a
thing
,
I
do
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
;
``
and
when
I
say
*NL*
I
will
have
a
thing
done
,
I
will
have
it
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Will
have
a
thing
done
,
I
will
have
it
done
,
''
repeated
the
man
with
*NL*
the
wooden
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
determined
character
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
That
's
what
I
am
.
I
do
*NL*
my
duty
.
That
's
what
_
I
_
do
.
My
flesh
and
blood
''
--
he
looked
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Creakle
as
he
said
this
--
``
when
it
rises
against
me
,
is
not
my
flesh
and
*NL*
blood
.
I
discard
it
.
Has
that
fellow
,
''
to
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
*NL*
``
been
here
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
He
knows
better
.
He
knows
me
.
Let
him
keep
*NL*
away
.
I
say
let
him
keep
away
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
striking
his
hand
upon
*NL*
the
table
,
and
looking
at
Mrs.
Creakle
,
``
for
he
knows
me
.
Now
you
have
*NL*
begun
to
know
me
too
,
my
young
friend
,
and
you
may
go
.
Take
him
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
glad
to
be
ordered
away
,
for
Mrs.
and
Miss
Creakle
were
both
*NL*
wiping
their
eyes
,
and
I
felt
as
uncomfortable
for
them
,
as
I
did
for
*NL*
myself
.
But
I
had
a
petition
on
my
mind
which
concerned
me
so
nearly
,
*NL*
that
I
could
n't
help
saying
,
though
I
wondered
at
my
own
courage
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
whispered
,
``
Hah
?
What
's
this
?
''
and
bent
his
eyes
upon
me
,
as
*NL*
if
he
would
have
burnt
me
up
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
''
I
faltered
,
``
if
I
might
be
allowed
-LRB-
I
am
very
*NL*
sorry
indeed
,
sir
,
for
what
I
did
-RRB-
to
take
this
writing
off
,
before
the
*NL*
boys
come
back
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Mr.
Creakle
was
in
earnest
,
or
whether
he
only
did
it
to
*NL*
frighten
me
I
do
n't
know
,
but
he
made
a
burst
out
of
his
chair
,
before
*NL*
which
I
precipitately
retreated
,
without
waiting
for
the
escort
of
the
*NL*
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
and
never
once
stopped
until
I
reached
my
own
*NL*
bedroom
,
where
,
finding
I
was
not
pursued
,
I
went
to
bed
,
as
it
was
*NL*
time
,
and
lay
quaking
,
for
a
couple
of
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
Mr.
Sharp
came
back
.
Mr.
Sharp
was
the
first
master
,
*NL*
and
superior
to
Mr.
Mell
.
Mr.
Mell
took
his
meals
with
the
boys
,
but
*NL*
Mr.
Sharp
dined
and
supped
at
Mr.
Creakle
's
table
.
He
was
a
limp
,
*NL*
delicate-looking
gentleman
,
I
thought
,
with
a
good
deal
of
nose
,
and
a
*NL*
way
of
carrying
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
it
were
a
little
too
heavy
*NL*
for
him
.
His
hair
was
very
smooth
and
wavy
;
but
I
was
informed
by
the
*NL*
very
first
boy
who
came
back
that
it
was
a
wig
-LRB-
a
second-hand
one
_
he
_
*NL*
said
-RRB-
,
and
that
Mr.
Sharp
went
out
every
Saturday
afternoon
to
get
it
*NL*
curled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
other
than
Tommy
Traddles
who
gave
me
this
piece
of
*NL*
intelligence
.
He
was
the
first
boy
who
returned
.
He
introduced
himself
*NL*
by
informing
me
that
I
should
find
his
name
on
the
right-hand
corner
of
*NL*
the
gate
,
over
the
top
bolt
;
upon
that
I
said
,
``
Traddles
?
''
to
which
he
*NL*
replied
,
``
The
same
,
''
and
then
he
asked
me
for
a
full
account
of
myself
*NL*
and
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
happy
circumstance
for
me
that
Traddles
came
back
first
.
He
*NL*
enjoyed
my
placard
so
much
,
that
he
saved
me
from
the
embarrassment
of
*NL*
either
disclosure
or
concealment
,
by
presenting
me
to
every
other
boy
*NL*
who
came
back
,
great
or
small
,
immediately
on
his
arrival
,
in
this
form
*NL*
of
introduction
,
``
Look
here
!
Here
's
a
game
!
''
Happily
,
too
,
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
the
boys
came
back
low-spirited
,
and
were
not
so
boisterous
at
*NL*
my
expense
as
I
had
expected
.
Some
of
them
certainly
did
dance
about
me
*NL*
like
wild
Indians
,
and
the
greater
part
could
not
resist
the
temptation
*NL*
of
pretending
that
I
was
a
dog
,
and
patting
and
smoothing
me
lest
I
*NL*
should
bite
,
and
saying
,
``
Lie
down
,
sir
!
''
and
calling
me
Towzer
.
This
*NL*
was
naturally
confusing
,
among
so
many
strangers
,
and
cost
me
some
*NL*
tears
,
but
on
the
whole
it
was
much
better
than
I
had
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
considered
as
being
formally
received
into
the
school
,
*NL*
however
,
until
J.
Steerforth
arrived
.
Before
this
boy
,
who
was
reputed
*NL*
to
be
a
great
scholar
,
and
was
very
good-looking
,
and
at
least
*NL*
half-a-dozen
years
my
senior
,
I
was
carried
as
before
a
magistrate
.
He
*NL*
enquired
,
under
a
shed
in
the
playground
,
into
the
particulars
of
my
*NL*
punishment
,
and
was
pleased
to
express
his
opinion
that
it
was
``
a
jolly
*NL*
shame
;
''
for
which
I
became
bound
to
him
ever
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
money
have
you
got
,
Copperfield
?
''
he
said
,
walking
aside
with
me
*NL*
when
he
had
disposed
of
my
affair
in
these
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
seven
shillings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
give
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
,
''
he
said
.
``
At
least
,
you
*NL*
can
if
you
like
.
You
need
n't
if
you
do
n't
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hastened
to
comply
with
his
friendly
suggestion
,
and
opening
*NL*
Peggotty
's
purse
,
turned
it
upside
down
into
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
spend
anything
now
?
''
he
asked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
if
you
like
,
you
know
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Say
the
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
'd
like
to
spend
a
couple
of
shillings
or
so
,
in
a
bottle
of
*NL*
currant
wine
by-and-by
,
up
in
the
bedroom
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
You
belong
*NL*
to
my
bedroom
,
I
find
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
,
but
I
said
,
Yes
,
I
should
*NL*
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
You
'll
be
glad
to
spend
another
shilling
*NL*
or
so
,
in
almond
cakes
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
Yes
,
I
should
like
that
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
another
shilling
or
so
in
biscuits
,
and
another
in
fruit
,
eh
?
''
said
*NL*
Steerforth
.
``
I
say
,
young
Copperfield
,
you
're
going
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled
because
he
smiled
,
but
I
was
a
little
troubled
in
my
mind
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
We
must
make
it
stretch
as
far
as
we
can
;
*NL*
that
's
all
.
I
'll
do
the
best
in
my
power
for
you
.
I
can
go
out
when
I
*NL*
like
,
and
I
'll
smuggle
the
prog
in
.
''
With
these
words
he
put
the
money
*NL*
in
his
pocket
,
and
kindly
told
me
not
to
make
myself
uneasy
;
he
would
*NL*
take
care
it
should
be
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
if
that
were
all
right
which
I
had
a
secret
*NL*
misgiving
was
nearly
all
wrong
--
for
I
feared
it
was
a
waste
of
my
*NL*
mother
's
two
half-crowns
--
though
I
had
preserved
the
piece
of
paper
they
*NL*
were
wrapped
in
:
which
was
a
precious
saving
.
When
we
went
up-stairs
to
*NL*
bed
,
he
produced
the
whole
seven
shillings
'
worth
,
and
laid
it
out
on
my
*NL*
bed
in
the
moonlight
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
are
,
young
Copperfield
,
and
a
royal
spread
you
've
got
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
think
of
doing
the
honors
of
the
feast
,
at
my
time
of
life
,
*NL*
while
he
was
by
;
my
hand
shook
at
the
very
thought
of
it
.
I
begged
him
*NL*
to
do
me
the
favor
of
presiding
;
and
my
request
being
seconded
by
the
*NL*
other
boys
who
were
in
that
room
,
he
acceded
to
it
,
and
sat
upon
my
*NL*
pillow
,
handing
round
the
viands
--
with
perfect
fairness
,
I
must
say
--
and
*NL*
dispensing
the
currant
wine
in
a
little
glass
without
a
foot
,
which
was
*NL*
his
own
property
.
As
to
me
,
I
sat
on
his
left
hand
,
and
the
rest
were
*NL*
grouped
about
us
,
on
the
nearest
beds
and
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
well
I
recollect
our
sitting
there
,
talking
in
whispers
;
or
their
*NL*
talking
,
and
my
respectfully
listening
,
I
ought
rather
to
say
;
the
*NL*
moonlight
falling
a
little
way
into
the
room
,
through
the
window
,
*NL*
painting
a
pale
window
on
the
floor
,
and
the
greater
part
of
us
in
*NL*
shadow
,
except
when
Steerforth
dipped
a
match
into
a
phosphorous-box
,
*NL*
when
he
wanted
to
look
for
anything
on
the
board
,
and
shed
a
blue
glare
*NL*
over
us
that
was
gone
directly
!
A
certain
mysterious
feeling
,
consequent
*NL*
on
the
darkness
,
the
secresy
of
the
revel
,
and
the
whisper
in
which
*NL*
everything
was
said
,
steals
over
me
again
,
and
I
listen
to
all
they
tell
*NL*
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
solemnity
and
awe
,
which
makes
me
glad
that
*NL*
they
are
all
so
near
,
and
frightens
me
-LRB-
though
I
feign
to
laugh
-RRB-
when
*NL*
Traddles
pretends
to
see
a
ghost
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
all
kinds
of
things
about
the
school
and
all
belonging
to
it
.
I
*NL*
heard
that
Mr.
Creakle
had
not
preferred
his
claim
to
being
a
Tartar
*NL*
without
reason
;
that
he
was
the
sternest
and
most
severe
of
masters
;
*NL*
that
he
laid
about
him
,
right
and
left
,
every
day
of
his
life
,
charging
*NL*
in
among
the
boys
like
a
trooper
,
and
slashing
away
,
unmercifully
.
That
*NL*
he
knew
nothing
himself
,
but
the
art
of
slashing
,
being
more
ignorant
*NL*
-LRB-
J.
Steerforth
said
-RRB-
than
the
lowest
boy
in
the
school
;
that
he
had
*NL*
been
,
a
good
many
years
ago
,
a
small
hop-dealer
in
the
Borough
,
and
had
*NL*
taken
to
the
schooling
business
after
being
bankrupt
in
hops
,
and
making
*NL*
away
with
Mrs.
Creakle
's
money
.
With
a
good
deal
more
of
that
sort
,
*NL*
which
I
wondered
how
they
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
that
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
whose
name
was
Tungay
,
was
an
*NL*
obstinate
barbarian
who
had
formerly
assisted
in
the
hop
business
,
but
*NL*
had
come
into
the
scholastic
line
with
Mr.
Creakle
,
in
consequence
,
as
*NL*
was
supposed
among
the
boys
,
of
his
having
broken
his
leg
in
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
's
service
,
and
having
done
a
deal
of
dishonest
work
for
him
,
and
*NL*
knowing
his
secrets
.
I
heard
that
with
the
single
exception
of
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
,
Tungay
considered
the
whole
establishment
,
masters
and
boys
,
as
*NL*
his
natural
enemies
,
and
that
the
only
delight
of
his
life
was
to
be
*NL*
sour
and
malicious
.
I
heard
that
Mr.
Creakle
had
a
son
,
who
had
not
been
*NL*
Tungay
's
friend
,
and
who
,
assisting
in
the
school
,
had
once
held
some
*NL*
remonstrance
with
his
father
on
an
occasion
when
its
discipline
was
very
*NL*
cruelly
exercised
,
and
was
supposed
,
besides
,
to
have
protested
against
*NL*
his
father
's
usage
of
his
mother
.
I
heard
that
Mr.
Creakle
had
turned
*NL*
him
out
of
doors
,
in
consequence
;
and
that
Mrs.
and
Miss
Creakle
had
*NL*
been
in
a
sad
way
,
ever
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
greatest
wonder
that
I
heard
of
Mr.
Creakle
was
,
there
being
one
*NL*
boy
in
the
school
on
whom
he
never
ventured
to
lay
a
hand
,
and
that
boy
*NL*
being
J.
Steerforth
.
Steerforth
himself
confirmed
this
when
it
was
*NL*
stated
,
and
said
that
he
should
like
to
begin
to
see
him
do
it
.
On
being
*NL*
asked
by
a
mild
boy
-LRB-
not
me
-RRB-
how
he
would
proceed
if
he
did
begin
to
see
*NL*
him
do
it
,
he
dipped
a
match
into
his
phosphorous-box
on
purpose
to
shed
*NL*
a
glare
over
his
reply
,
and
said
he
would
commence
by
knocking
him
down
*NL*
with
a
blow
on
the
forehead
from
the
seven-and-sixpenny
ink-bottle
that
*NL*
was
always
on
the
mantelpiece
.
We
sat
in
the
dark
for
some
time
,
*NL*
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
that
Mr.
Sharp
and
Mr.
Mell
were
both
supposed
to
be
wretchedly
*NL*
paid
;
and
that
when
there
was
hot
and
cold
meat
for
dinner
at
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
's
table
,
Mr.
Sharp
was
always
expected
to
say
he
preferred
cold
;
*NL*
which
was
again
corroborated
by
J.
Steerforth
,
the
only
parlor-boarder
.
*NL*
I
heard
that
Mr.
Sharp
's
wig
did
n't
fit
him
;
and
that
he
need
n't
be
so
*NL*
``
bounceable
''
--
somebody
else
said
``
bumptious
''
--
about
it
,
because
his
own
*NL*
red
hair
was
very
plainly
to
be
seen
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
that
one
boy
,
who
was
a
coal-merchant
's
son
,
came
as
a
set-off
*NL*
against
the
coal-bill
,
and
was
called
on
that
account
``
Exchange
or
*NL*
Barter
''
--
a
name
selected
from
the
arithmetic-book
as
expressing
this
*NL*
arrangement
.
I
heard
that
the
table-beer
was
a
robbery
of
parents
,
and
*NL*
the
pudding
an
imposition
.
I
heard
that
Miss
Creakle
was
regarded
by
the
*NL*
school
in
general
as
being
in
love
with
Steerforth
;
and
I
am
sure
,
as
I
*NL*
sat
in
the
dark
,
thinking
of
his
nice
voice
,
and
his
fine
face
,
and
his
*NL*
easy
manner
,
and
his
curling
hair
,
I
thought
it
very
likely
.
I
heard
*NL*
that
Mr.
Mell
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
,
but
had
n't
a
sixpence
to
*NL*
bless
himself
with
;
and
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
old
Mrs.
Mell
,
his
*NL*
mother
,
was
as
poor
as
Job
.
I
thought
of
my
breakfast
then
,
and
what
had
*NL*
sounded
like
``
My
Charley
!
''
but
I
was
,
I
am
glad
to
remember
,
as
mute
as
*NL*
a
mouse
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hearing
of
all
this
,
and
a
good
deal
more
,
outlasted
the
banquet
*NL*
some
time
.
The
greater
part
of
the
guests
had
gone
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
eating
and
drinking
were
over
;
and
we
,
who
had
remained
whispering
and
*NL*
listening
half
undressed
,
at
last
betook
ourselves
to
bed
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
young
Copperfield
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
I
'll
take
care
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
kind
,
''
I
gratefully
returned
.
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
got
a
sister
,
have
you
?
''
said
Steerforth
,
yawning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pity
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
If
you
had
had
one
,
I
should
think
*NL*
she
would
have
been
a
pretty
,
timid
,
little
,
bright-eyed
sort
of
girl
.
I
*NL*
should
have
liked
to
know
her
.
Good
night
,
young
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
sir
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
him
very
much
after
I
went
to
bed
,
and
raised
myself
,
I
*NL*
recollect
,
to
look
at
him
where
he
lay
in
the
moonlight
,
with
his
*NL*
handsome
face
turned
up
,
and
his
head
reclining
easily
on
his
arm
.
He
*NL*
was
a
person
of
great
power
in
my
eyes
;
that
was
of
course
the
reason
of
*NL*
my
mind
running
on
him
.
No
veiled
future
dimly
glanced
upon
him
in
the
*NL*
moonbeams
.
There
was
no
shadowy
picture
of
his
footsteps
,
in
the
garden
*NL*
that
I
dreamed
of
walking
in
all
night
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
MY
``
FIRST
HALF
''
AT
SALEM
HOUSE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
School
began
in
earnest
next
day
.
A
profound
impression
was
made
upon
*NL*
me
,
I
remember
,
by
the
roar
of
voices
in
the
schoolroom
suddenly
*NL*
becoming
hushed
as
death
when
Mr.
Creakle
entered
after
breakfast
,
and
*NL*
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
round
upon
us
like
a
giant
in
a
story-book
*NL*
surveying
his
captives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tungay
stood
at
Mr.
Creakle
's
elbow
.
He
had
no
occasion
,
I
thought
,
to
*NL*
cry
out
``
Silence
!
''
so
ferociously
,
for
the
boys
were
all
struck
*NL*
speechless
and
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
was
seen
to
speak
,
and
Tungay
was
heard
,
to
this
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
boys
,
this
is
a
new
half
.
Take
care
what
you
're
about
,
in
this
new
*NL*
half
.
Come
fresh
up
to
the
lessons
,
I
advise
you
,
for
I
come
fresh
up
to
*NL*
the
punishment
.
I
wo
n't
flinch
.
It
will
be
of
no
use
your
rubbing
*NL*
yourselves
;
you
wo
n't
rub
the
marks
out
that
I
shall
give
you
.
Now
get
*NL*
to
work
,
every
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
dreadful
exordium
was
over
,
and
Tungay
had
stumped
out
again
,
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
came
to
where
I
sat
,
and
told
me
that
if
I
were
famous
for
*NL*
biting
,
he
was
famous
for
biting
,
too
.
He
then
showed
me
the
cane
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
_
that
_
,
for
a
tooth
?
Was
it
a
sharp
tooth
,
*NL*
hey
?
Was
it
a
double
tooth
,
hey
?
Had
it
a
deep
prong
,
hey
?
Did
it
bite
,
*NL*
hey
?
Did
it
bite
?
At
every
question
he
gave
me
a
fleshy
cut
with
it
that
*NL*
made
me
writhe
;
so
I
was
very
soon
made
free
of
Salem
House
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Steerforth
said
-RRB-
,
and
very
soon
in
tears
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
I
mean
to
say
these
were
special
marks
of
distinction
,
which
*NL*
only
I
received
.
On
the
contrary
,
a
large
majority
of
the
boys
*NL*
-LRB-
especially
the
smaller
ones
-RRB-
were
visited
with
similar
instances
of
*NL*
notice
,
as
Mr.
Creakle
made
the
round
of
the
schoolroom
.
Half
the
*NL*
establishment
was
writhing
and
crying
,
before
the
day
's
work
began
;
and
*NL*
how
much
of
it
had
writhed
and
cried
before
the
day
's
work
was
over
,
I
*NL*
am
really
afraid
to
recollect
,
lest
I
should
seem
to
exaggerate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
think
there
never
can
have
been
a
man
who
enjoyed
his
*NL*
profession
more
than
Mr.
Creakle
did
.
He
had
a
delight
in
cutting
at
the
*NL*
boys
,
which
was
like
the
satisfaction
of
a
craving
appetite
.
I
am
*NL*
confident
that
he
could
n't
resist
a
chubby
boy
,
especially
;
that
there
*NL*
was
a
fascination
in
such
a
subject
,
which
made
him
restless
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
until
he
had
scored
and
marked
him
for
the
day
.
I
was
chubby
*NL*
myself
,
and
ought
to
know
.
I
am
sure
when
I
think
of
the
fellow
now
,
my
*NL*
blood
rises
against
him
with
the
disinterested
indignation
I
should
feel
*NL*
if
I
could
have
known
all
about
him
without
having
ever
been
in
his
*NL*
power
;
but
it
rises
hotly
,
because
I
know
him
to
have
been
an
incapable
*NL*
brute
,
who
had
no
more
right
to
be
possessed
of
the
great
trust
he
held
,
*NL*
than
to
be
Lord
High
Admiral
,
or
Commander-in-chief
:
in
either
of
which
*NL*
capacities
,
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
done
infinitely
less
*NL*
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miserable
little
propitiators
of
a
remorseless
Idol
,
how
abject
we
were
*NL*
to
him
!
What
a
launch
in
life
I
think
it
now
,
on
looking
back
,
to
be
so
*NL*
mean
and
servile
to
a
man
of
such
parts
and
pretensions
!
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
sit
at
the
desk
again
,
watching
his
eye
--
humbly
watching
his
eye
,
*NL*
as
he
rules
a
cyphering-book
for
another
victim
whose
hands
have
just
*NL*
been
flattened
by
that
identical
ruler
,
and
who
is
trying
to
wipe
the
*NL*
sting
out
with
a
pocket-handkerchief
.
I
have
plenty
to
do
.
I
do
n't
watch
*NL*
his
eye
in
idleness
,
but
because
I
am
morbidly
attracted
to
it
,
in
a
*NL*
dread
desire
to
know
what
he
will
do
next
,
and
whether
it
will
be
my
*NL*
turn
to
suffer
,
or
somebody
else
's
.
A
lane
of
small
boys
beyond
me
,
with
*NL*
the
same
interest
in
his
eye
,
watch
it
too
.
I
think
he
knows
it
,
though
*NL*
he
pretends
he
do
n't
.
He
makes
dreadful
mouths
as
he
rules
the
*NL*
cyphering-book
;
and
now
he
throws
his
eye
sideways
down
our
lane
,
and
we
*NL*
all
droop
over
our
books
and
tremble
.
A
moment
afterwards
we
are
again
*NL*
eyeing
him
.
An
unhappy
culprit
,
found
guilty
of
imperfect
exercise
,
*NL*
approaches
at
his
command
.
The
culprit
falters
excuses
,
and
professes
a
*NL*
determination
to
do
better
to-morrow
.
Mr.
Creakle
cuts
a
joke
before
he
*NL*
beats
him
,
and
we
laugh
at
it
,
--
miserable
little
dogs
,
we
laugh
,
with
*NL*
our
visages
as
white
as
ashes
,
and
our
hearts
sinking
into
our
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
sit
at
the
desk
again
,
on
a
drowsy
summer
afternoon
.
A
buzz
and
*NL*
hum
go
up
around
me
,
as
if
the
boys
were
so
many
blue-bottles
.
A
cloggy
*NL*
sensation
of
the
lukewarm
fat
of
meat
is
upon
me
-LRB-
we
dined
an
hour
or
*NL*
two
ago
-RRB-
,
and
my
head
is
as
heavy
as
so
much
lead
.
I
would
give
the
*NL*
world
to
go
to
sleep
.
I
sit
with
my
eye
on
Mr.
Creakle
,
blinking
at
him
*NL*
like
a
young
owl
;
when
sleep
overpowers
me
for
a
minute
,
he
still
looms
*NL*
through
my
slumber
,
ruling
those
cyphering-books
;
until
he
softly
comes
*NL*
behind
me
and
wakes
me
to
plainer
perception
of
him
,
with
a
red
ridge
*NL*
across
my
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
am
in
the
playground
,
with
my
eye
still
fascinated
by
him
,
though
*NL*
I
ca
n't
see
him
.
The
window
at
a
little
distance
from
which
I
know
he
is
*NL*
having
his
dinner
,
stands
for
him
,
and
I
eye
that
instead
.
If
he
shows
*NL*
his
face
near
it
,
mine
assumes
an
imploring
and
submissive
expression
.
*NL*
If
he
looks
out
through
the
glass
,
the
boldest
boy
-LRB-
Steerforth
excepted
-RRB-
*NL*
stops
in
the
middle
of
a
shout
or
yell
,
and
becomes
contemplative
.
One
*NL*
day
,
Traddles
-LRB-
the
most
unfortunate
boy
in
the
world
-RRB-
breaks
that
window
*NL*
accidentally
,
with
a
ball
.
I
shudder
at
this
moment
with
the
tremendous
*NL*
sensation
of
seeing
it
done
,
and
feeling
that
the
ball
has
bounded
on
to
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
's
sacred
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Traddles
!
In
a
tight
sky-blue
suit
that
made
his
arms
and
legs
like
*NL*
German
sausages
,
or
roly-poly
puddings
,
he
was
the
merriest
and
most
*NL*
miserable
of
all
the
boys
.
He
was
always
being
caned
--
I
think
he
was
*NL*
caned
every
day
that
half-year
,
except
one
holiday
Monday
when
he
was
*NL*
only
ruler
'd
on
both
hands
--
and
was
always
going
to
write
to
his
uncle
*NL*
about
it
,
and
never
did
.
After
laying
his
head
on
the
desk
for
a
little
*NL*
while
,
he
would
cheer
up
,
somehow
,
begin
to
laugh
again
,
and
draw
*NL*
skeletons
all
over
his
slate
,
before
his
eyes
were
dry
.
I
used
at
first
*NL*
to
wonder
what
comfort
Traddles
found
in
drawing
skeletons
;
and
for
some
*NL*
time
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
hermit
,
who
reminded
himself
by
those
*NL*
symbols
of
mortality
that
caning
could
n't
last
for
ever
.
But
I
believe
*NL*
he
only
did
it
because
they
were
easy
,
and
did
n't
want
any
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
honorable
,
Traddles
was
;
and
held
it
as
a
solemn
duty
in
the
*NL*
boys
to
stand
by
one
another
.
He
suffered
for
this
on
several
occasions
;
*NL*
and
particularly
once
,
when
Steerforth
laughed
in
church
,
and
the
Beadle
*NL*
thought
it
was
Traddles
,
and
took
him
out
.
I
see
him
now
,
going
away
in
*NL*
custody
,
despised
by
the
congregation
.
He
never
said
who
was
the
real
*NL*
offender
,
though
he
smarted
for
it
next
day
,
and
was
imprisoned
so
many
*NL*
hours
that
he
came
forth
with
a
whole
churchyard-full
of
skeletons
*NL*
swarming
all
over
his
Latin
Dictionary
.
But
he
had
his
reward
.
*NL*
Steerforth
said
there
was
nothing
of
the
sneak
in
Traddles
,
and
we
all
*NL*
felt
that
to
be
the
highest
praise
.
For
my
part
,
I
could
have
gone
*NL*
through
a
good
deal
-LRB-
though
I
was
much
less
brave
than
Traddles
,
and
*NL*
nothing
like
so
old
-RRB-
to
have
won
such
a
recompense
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
see
Steerforth
walk
to
church
before
us
,
arm-in-arm
with
Miss
*NL*
Creakle
,
was
one
of
the
great
sights
of
my
life
.
I
did
n't
think
Miss
*NL*
Creakle
equal
to
little
Em
`
ly
in
point
of
beauty
,
and
I
did
n't
love
her
*NL*
-LRB-
I
did
n't
dare
-RRB-
;
but
I
thought
her
a
young
lady
of
extraordinary
*NL*
attractions
,
and
in
point
of
gentility
not
to
be
surpassed
.
When
*NL*
Steerforth
,
in
white
trousers
,
carried
her
parasol
for
her
,
I
felt
proud
*NL*
to
know
him
;
and
believed
that
she
could
not
choose
but
adore
him
with
*NL*
all
her
heart
.
Mr.
Sharp
and
Mr.
Mell
were
both
notable
personages
in
my
*NL*
eyes
;
but
Steerforth
was
to
them
what
the
sun
was
to
two
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
Steerforth
and
Mr.
Mell
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
continued
his
protection
of
me
,
and
proved
a
very
useful
*NL*
friend
;
since
nobody
dared
to
annoy
one
whom
he
honored
with
his
*NL*
countenance
.
He
could
n't
--
or
at
all
events
,
he
did
n't
--
defend
me
from
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
,
who
was
very
severe
with
me
;
but
whenever
I
had
been
*NL*
treated
worse
than
usual
,
he
always
told
me
that
I
wanted
a
little
of
*NL*
his
pluck
,
and
that
he
would
n't
have
stood
it
himself
;
which
I
felt
he
*NL*
intended
for
encouragement
,
and
considered
to
be
very
kind
of
him
.
There
*NL*
was
one
advantage
,
and
only
one
that
I
know
of
,
in
Mr.
Creakle
's
*NL*
severity
.
He
found
my
placard
in
his
way
,
when
he
came
up
or
down
behind
*NL*
the
form
on
which
I
sat
,
and
wanted
to
make
a
cut
at
me
in
passing
;
for
*NL*
this
reason
it
was
soon
taken
off
,
and
I
saw
it
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
accidental
circumstance
cemented
the
intimacy
between
Steerforth
and
*NL*
me
,
in
a
manner
that
inspired
me
with
great
pride
and
satisfaction
,
*NL*
though
it
sometimes
led
to
inconvenience
.
It
happened
on
one
occasion
,
*NL*
when
he
was
doing
me
the
honor
of
talking
to
me
in
the
playground
,
*NL*
that
I
hazarded
the
observation
that
something
or
somebody
--
I
forget
*NL*
what
now
--
was
like
something
or
somebody
in
Peregrine
Pickle
.
He
said
*NL*
nothing
at
the
time
;
but
when
I
was
going
to
bed
at
night
,
asked
me
if
*NL*
I
had
got
that
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
no
,
and
explained
how
it
was
that
I
had
read
it
,
and
all
*NL*
those
other
books
of
which
I
have
made
mention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
recollect
them
?
''
Steerforth
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
yes
,
I
replied
;
I
had
a
good
memory
,
and
I
believed
I
recollected
*NL*
them
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
tell
you
what
,
young
Copperfield
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
you
shall
*NL*
tell
'em
to
me
.
I
ca
n't
get
to
sleep
very
early
at
night
,
and
I
*NL*
generally
wake
rather
early
in
the
morning
.
We
'll
go
over
'em
one
after
*NL*
another
.
We
'll
make
some
regular
Arabian
Nights
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
extremely
flattered
by
this
arrangement
,
and
we
commenced
*NL*
carrying
it
into
execution
that
very
evening
.
What
ravages
I
committed
*NL*
on
my
favorite
authors
in
the
course
of
my
interpretation
of
them
,
I
am
*NL*
not
in
a
condition
to
say
,
and
should
be
very
unwilling
to
know
;
but
I
*NL*
had
a
profound
faith
in
them
,
and
I
had
,
to
the
best
of
my
belief
,
a
*NL*
simple
,
earnest
manner
of
narrating
what
I
did
narrate
;
and
these
*NL*
qualities
went
a
long
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawback
was
,
that
I
was
often
sleepy
at
night
,
or
out
of
spirits
*NL*
and
indisposed
to
resume
the
story
;
and
then
it
was
rather
hard
work
,
*NL*
and
it
must
be
done
;
for
to
disappoint
or
displease
Steerforth
was
of
*NL*
course
out
of
the
question
.
In
the
morning
,
too
,
when
I
felt
weary
and
*NL*
should
have
enjoyed
another
hour
's
repose
very
much
,
it
was
a
tiresome
*NL*
thing
to
be
roused
,
like
the
Sultana
Scheherazade
,
and
forced
into
a
*NL*
long
story
before
the
getting-up
bell
rang
;
but
Steerforth
was
resolute
;
*NL*
and
as
he
explained
to
me
,
in
return
,
my
sums
and
exercises
,
and
*NL*
anything
in
my
tasks
that
was
too
hard
for
me
,
I
was
no
loser
by
the
*NL*
transaction
.
Let
me
do
myself
justice
,
however
.
I
was
moved
by
no
*NL*
interested
or
selfish
motive
,
nor
was
I
moved
by
fear
of
him
.
I
admired
*NL*
and
loved
him
,
and
his
approval
was
return
enough
.
It
was
so
precious
to
*NL*
me
that
I
look
back
on
these
trifles
,
now
,
with
an
aching
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
was
considerate
,
too
;
and
showed
his
consideration
,
in
one
*NL*
particular
instance
,
in
an
unflinching
manner
that
was
a
little
*NL*
tantalising
,
I
suspect
,
to
poor
Traddles
and
the
rest
.
Peggotty
's
*NL*
promised
letter
--
what
a
comfortable
letter
it
was
!
--
arrived
before
``
the
*NL*
half
''
was
many
weeks
old
;
and
with
it
a
cake
in
a
perfect
nest
of
*NL*
oranges
,
and
two
bottles
of
cowslip
wine
.
This
treasure
,
as
in
duty
*NL*
bound
,
I
laid
at
the
feet
of
Steerforth
,
and
begged
him
to
dispense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
young
Copperfield
,
''
said
he
:
``
the
wine
shall
*NL*
be
kept
to
wet
your
whistle
when
you
are
story-telling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
blushed
at
the
idea
,
and
begged
him
,
in
my
modesty
,
not
to
think
of
*NL*
it
.
But
he
said
he
had
observed
I
was
sometimes
hoarse
--
a
little
roopy
*NL*
was
his
exact
expression
--
and
it
should
be
,
every
drop
,
devoted
to
the
*NL*
purpose
he
had
mentioned
.
Accordingly
,
it
was
locked
up
in
his
box
,
and
*NL*
drawn
off
by
himself
in
a
phial
,
and
administered
to
me
through
a
piece
*NL*
of
quill
in
the
cork
,
when
I
was
supposed
to
be
in
want
of
a
*NL*
restorative
.
Sometimes
,
to
make
it
a
more
sovereign
specific
,
he
was
so
*NL*
kind
as
to
squeeze
orange
juice
into
it
,
or
to
stir
it
up
with
ginger
,
*NL*
or
dissolve
a
peppermint
drop
in
it
;
and
although
I
can
not
assert
that
*NL*
the
flavour
was
improved
by
these
experiments
,
or
that
it
was
exactly
*NL*
the
compound
one
would
have
chosen
for
a
stomachic
,
the
last
thing
at
*NL*
night
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
I
drank
it
gratefully
and
was
*NL*
very
sensible
of
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
seem
,
to
me
,
to
have
been
months
over
Peregrine
,
and
months
more
over
*NL*
the
other
stories
.
The
institution
never
flagged
for
want
of
a
story
,
I
*NL*
am
certain
;
and
the
wine
lasted
out
almost
as
well
as
the
matter
.
Poor
*NL*
Traddles
--
I
never
think
of
that
boy
but
with
a
strange
disposition
to
*NL*
laugh
,
and
with
tears
in
my
eyes
--
was
a
sort
of
chorus
,
in
general
;
and
*NL*
affected
to
be
convulsed
with
mirth
at
the
comic
parts
,
and
to
be
*NL*
overcome
with
fear
when
there
was
any
passage
of
an
alarming
character
*NL*
in
the
narrative
.
This
rather
put
me
out
,
very
often
.
It
was
a
great
*NL*
jest
of
his
,
I
recollect
,
to
pretend
that
he
could
n't
keep
his
teeth
*NL*
from
chattering
,
whenever
mention
was
made
of
an
Alguazil
in
connexion
*NL*
with
the
adventures
of
Gil
Blas
;
and
I
remember
,
when
Gil
Blas
met
the
*NL*
captain
of
the
robbers
in
Madrid
,
this
unlucky
joker
counterfeited
such
*NL*
an
ague
of
terror
,
that
he
was
overheard
by
Mr.
Creakle
,
who
was
*NL*
prowling
about
the
passage
,
and
handsomely
flogged
for
disorderly
*NL*
conduct
in
the
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
I
had
within
me
that
was
romantic
and
dreamy
,
was
encouraged
by
*NL*
so
much
story-telling
in
the
dark
;
and
in
that
respect
the
pursuit
may
*NL*
not
have
been
very
profitable
to
me
.
But
the
being
cherished
as
a
kind
*NL*
of
plaything
in
my
room
,
and
the
consciousness
that
this
accomplishment
*NL*
of
mine
was
bruited
about
among
the
boys
,
and
attracted
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
notice
to
me
though
I
was
the
youngest
there
,
stimulated
me
to
exertion
.
*NL*
In
a
school
carried
on
by
sheer
cruelty
,
whether
it
is
presided
over
by
*NL*
a
dunce
or
not
,
there
is
not
likely
to
be
much
learnt
.
I
believe
our
*NL*
boys
were
,
generally
,
as
ignorant
a
set
as
any
schoolboys
in
existence
;
*NL*
they
were
too
much
troubled
and
knocked
about
to
learn
;
they
could
no
*NL*
more
do
that
to
advantage
,
than
any
one
can
do
anything
to
advantage
in
*NL*
a
life
of
constant
misfortune
,
torment
,
and
worry
.
But
my
little
vanity
,
*NL*
and
Steerforth
's
help
,
urged
me
on
somehow
;
and
without
saving
me
from
*NL*
much
,
if
anything
,
in
the
way
of
punishment
,
made
me
,
for
the
time
I
was
*NL*
there
,
an
exception
to
the
general
body
,
insomuch
that
I
did
steadily
*NL*
pick
up
some
crumbs
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
I
was
much
assisted
by
Mr.
Mell
,
who
had
a
liking
for
me
that
I
*NL*
am
grateful
to
remember
.
It
always
gave
me
pain
to
observe
that
*NL*
Steerforth
treated
him
with
systematic
disparagement
,
and
seldom
lost
an
*NL*
occasion
of
wounding
his
feelings
,
or
inducing
others
to
do
so
.
This
*NL*
troubled
me
the
more
for
a
long
time
,
because
I
had
soon
told
*NL*
Steerforth
,
from
whom
I
could
no
more
keep
such
a
secret
,
than
I
could
*NL*
keep
a
cake
or
any
other
tangible
possession
,
about
the
two
old
women
*NL*
Mr.
Mell
had
taken
me
to
see
;
and
I
was
always
afraid
that
Steerforth
*NL*
would
let
it
out
,
and
twit
him
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
little
thought
any
one
of
us
,
I
dare
say
,
when
I
ate
my
breakfast
*NL*
that
first
morning
,
and
went
to
sleep
under
the
shadow
of
the
peacock
's
*NL*
feathers
to
the
sound
of
the
flute
,
what
consequences
would
come
of
the
*NL*
introduction
into
those
alms-houses
of
my
insignificant
person
.
But
the
*NL*
visit
had
its
unforeseen
consequences
;
and
of
a
serious
sort
,
too
,
in
*NL*
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
Mr.
Creakle
kept
the
house
from
indisposition
,
which
*NL*
naturally
diffused
a
lively
joy
through
the
school
,
there
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
noise
in
the
course
of
the
morning
's
work
.
The
great
relief
and
*NL*
satisfaction
experienced
by
the
boys
made
them
difficult
to
manage
;
and
*NL*
though
the
dreaded
Tungay
brought
his
wooden
leg
in
twice
or
thrice
,
and
*NL*
took
notes
of
the
principal
offenders
'
names
,
no
great
impression
was
*NL*
made
by
it
,
as
they
were
pretty
sure
of
getting
into
trouble
to-morrow
*NL*
do
what
they
would
,
and
thought
it
wise
,
no
doubt
,
to
enjoy
themselves
*NL*
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
properly
,
a
half-holiday
;
being
Saturday
.
But
as
the
noise
in
*NL*
the
playground
would
have
disturbed
Mr.
Creakle
,
and
the
weather
was
not
*NL*
favorable
for
going
out
walking
,
we
were
ordered
into
school
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
set
some
lighter
tasks
than
usual
,
which
were
made
for
*NL*
the
occasion
.
It
was
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
Mr.
Sharp
went
out
to
*NL*
get
his
wig
curled
;
so
Mr.
Mell
,
who
always
did
the
drudgery
,
whatever
*NL*
it
was
,
kept
school
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
could
associate
the
idea
of
a
bull
or
a
bear
with
any
one
so
mild
*NL*
as
Mr.
Mell
,
I
should
think
of
him
,
in
connexion
with
that
afternoon
*NL*
when
the
uproar
was
at
its
height
,
as
of
one
of
those
animals
,
baited
by
*NL*
a
thousand
dogs
.
I
recall
him
bending
his
aching
head
,
supported
on
his
*NL*
bony
hand
,
over
the
book
on
his
desk
,
and
wretchedly
endeavouring
to
get
*NL*
on
with
his
tiresome
work
,
amidst
an
uproar
that
might
have
made
the
*NL*
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
giddy
.
Boys
started
in
and
out
of
their
*NL*
places
,
playing
at
puss
in
the
corner
with
other
boys
;
there
were
*NL*
laughing
boys
,
singing
boys
,
talking
boys
,
dancing
boys
,
howling
boys
;
*NL*
boys
shuffled
with
their
feet
,
boys
whirled
about
him
,
grinning
,
making
*NL*
faces
,
mimicking
him
behind
his
back
and
before
his
eyes
:
mimicking
his
*NL*
poverty
,
his
boots
,
his
coat
,
his
mother
,
everything
belonging
to
him
*NL*
that
they
should
have
had
consideration
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
cried
Mr.
Mell
,
suddenly
rising
up
,
and
striking
his
desk
*NL*
with
the
book
.
``
What
does
this
mean
!
It
's
impossible
to
bear
it
.
It
's
*NL*
maddening
.
How
can
you
do
it
to
me
,
boys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
book
that
he
struck
his
desk
with
;
and
as
I
stood
beside
him
,
*NL*
following
his
eye
as
it
glanced
round
the
room
,
I
saw
the
boys
all
stop
,
*NL*
some
suddenly
surprised
,
some
half
afraid
,
and
some
sorry
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
's
place
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
school
,
at
the
opposite
end
*NL*
of
the
long
room
.
He
was
lounging
with
his
back
against
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
looked
at
Mr.
Mell
with
his
mouth
shut
up
*NL*
as
if
he
were
whistling
,
when
Mr.
Mell
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
Mr.
Steerforth
!
''
said
Mr.
Mell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
yourself
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
turning
red
.
``
Whom
are
you
talking
*NL*
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
said
Mr.
Mell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
yourself
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
and
mind
your
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
titter
,
and
some
applause
;
but
Mr.
Mell
was
so
white
,
that
*NL*
silence
immediately
succeeded
;
and
one
boy
,
who
had
darted
out
behind
*NL*
him
to
imitate
his
mother
again
,
changed
his
mind
,
and
pretended
to
want
*NL*
a
pen
mended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
,
Steerforth
,
''
said
Mr.
Mell
,
``
that
I
am
not
acquainted
*NL*
with
the
power
you
can
establish
over
any
mind
here
''
--
he
laid
his
hand
,
*NL*
without
considering
what
he
did
-LRB-
as
I
supposed
-RRB-
,
upon
my
head
--
``
or
that
*NL*
I
have
not
observed
you
,
within
a
few
minutes
,
urging
your
juniors
on
to
*NL*
every
sort
of
outrage
against
me
,
you
are
mistaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
give
myself
the
trouble
of
thinking
at
all
about
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Steerforth
,
coolly
;
``
so
I
'm
not
mistaken
,
as
it
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
you
make
use
of
your
position
of
favoritism
here
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
pursued
Mr.
Mell
,
with
his
lip
trembling
very
much
,
``
to
insult
a
*NL*
gentleman
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
what
?
--
where
is
he
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
somebody
cried
out
,
``
Shame
,
J.
Steerforth
!
Too
bad
!
''
It
was
*NL*
Traddles
;
whom
Mr.
Mell
instantly
discomfited
by
bidding
him
hold
his
*NL*
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
To
insult
one
who
is
not
fortunate
in
life
,
sir
,
and
who
never
gave
*NL*
you
the

offence
,
and
the
many
reasons
for
not
insulting
whom
you
*NL*
are
old
enough
and
wise
enough
to
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
Mell
,
with
his
*NL*
lip
trembling
more
and
more
,
``
you
commit
a
mean
and
base
action

You
can
*NL*
sit
down

stand
up

Copperfield

on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
Copperfield

said
Steerforth
,
coming
forward
up
the
room
,
``
stop
*NL*
a
bit

I
tell
you
what

Mr.

once
for

take
the
*NL*
liberty
of
calling
me
mean

base
,
or
anything
of
that
sort

you
are
an
*NL*
impudent
beggar

You
are
always
a
beggar

you
know
;
but
when
you
do
*NL*
that
,
you
are
an
impudent
beggar

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
clear
whether
he
was
going
to
strike
Mr.
Mell
,
or
Mr.
Mell
was
*NL*
going
to
strike
him
,
or
there
was
any
such
intention
on
either
side
.
I
*NL*
saw
a
rigidity
come
upon
the
whole
school
as
if
they
had
been
turned
*NL*
into
stone
,
and
found
Mr.
Creakle
in
the
midst
of
us
,
with
Tungay
at
his
*NL*
side
,
and
Mrs.
and
Miss
Creakle
looking
in
at
the
door
as
if
they
were
*NL*
frightened
.
Mr.
Mell
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
desk
and
his
face
in
his
*NL*
hands
,
sat
,
for
some
moments
,
quite
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mell
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
shaking
him
by
the
arm
;
and
his
whisper
*NL*
was
so
audible
now
,
that
Tungay
felt
it
unnecessary
to
repeat
his
words
;
*NL*
``
you
have
not
forgotten
yourself
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
no
,
''
returned
the
Master
,
showing
his
face
,
and
shaking
his
*NL*
head
,
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
great
agitation
.
``
No
,
sir

No

I
have
*NL*
remembered

little
sooner

it

would
have
been
more
kind
,

more
*NL*
just
,

It
would
have
saved
me
something

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
,
looking
hard
at
Mr.
Mell
,
put
his
hand
on
Tungay
's
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
got
his
feet
upon
the
form
close
by
,
and
sat
upon
the
*NL*
desk
.
After
still
looking
hard
at
Mr.
Mell
from
this
throne
,
as
he
shook
*NL*
his
head
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
remained
in
the
same
state
of
*NL*
agitation
,
Mr.
Creakle
turned
to
Steerforth
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
as
he
do
n't
condescend
to
tell
me
,
what
_
is
_
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
evaded
the
question
for
a
little
while
;
looking
in
scorn
and
*NL*
anger
on
his
opponent
,
and
remaining
silent
.
I
could
not
help
thinking
*NL*
even
in
that
interval
,
I
remember
,
what
a
noble
fellow
he
was
in
*NL*
appearance
,
and
how
homely
and
plain
Mr.
Mell
looked
opposed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
mean
by
talking
about
favorites
,
then
!
''
said
Steerforth
at
*NL*
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Favorites
?
''
repeated
Mr.
Creakle
,
with
the
veins
in
his
forehead
*NL*
swelling
quickly
.
``
Who
talked
about
favorites
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
,
what
did
you
mean
by
that

?
''
demanded
Mr.
Creakle
,
*NL*
turning
angrily
on
his
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
,
Mr.
Creakle
,
''
he
returned
in
a
low
voice
,
``
as
I
said
;
that
no
*NL*
pupil
had
a
right
to
avail
himself
of
his
position

favoritism

*NL*
degrade
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

said
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
My

But
give
me
leave
to
*NL*
ask
you
,
Mr.
What

your-name

and
here
Mr.
Creakle
folded
his
arms
,
*NL*
cane
and
all
,
upon
his
chest
,
and
made
such
a
knot
of
his
brows
that
his
*NL*
little
eyes
were
hardly
visible
below
them
;
``
whether
,
when
you
talk
*NL*
about
favorites

you
showed
proper
respect
to
me

To
me
,

said
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
,
darting
his
head
at
him
suddenly
,
and
drawing
it
back
again
,
*NL*
``
the
principal
of
this
establishment
,
and
your
employer
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
judicious
,
sir
,
I
am
willing
to
admit
,
''
said
Mr.
Mell
.
``
I
*NL*
should
not
have
done
so
,
if
I
had
been
cool

*NL*
*NL*
Here
Steerforth
struck
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
said
I
was
mean
,
and
then
he
said
I
was
base

then
I
called
*NL*
him
a
beggar
.
If
_
I
_
had
been
cool
,
perhaps
I
should
n't
have
called
him
*NL*
a
beggar
.
But
I
did
,

I
am
ready
to
take
the
consequences
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
Without
considering
,
perhaps
,
whether
there
were
any
consequences
to
be
*NL*
taken
,
I
felt
quite
in
a
glow
at
this
gallant
speech
.
It
made
an
*NL*
impression
on
the
boys
too
,
for
there
was
a
low
stir
among
them
,
though
*NL*
no
one
spoke
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
surprised

Steerforth

although
your
candor
does
you
honor

said
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
,
``
does
you
honor

certainly

I
am
surprised

*NL*
must
say

attach
such
an
epithet
to
any
person
employed
*NL*
and
paid
in
Salem
House

''
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
gave
a
short
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
an

said
Mr.
Creakle
,
``
to
my

I
expect

more

If
Mr.
Mell
looked
homely

in
my
eyes
,
before
the
handsome
boy

it
would
*NL*
be
quite
impossible
to
say
how
homely

*NL*
``

Steerforth
?
''
cried
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
Why
,
where
*NL*
does
he
go
a
begging
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
not
a
beggar
himself
,
his
near
relation
's
one
,
''
said
*NL*
Steerforth
.
``
It
's
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
me
,
and
Mr.
Mell
's
hand
gently
patted
me
upon
the
*NL*
shoulder
.
I
looked
up
,
with
a
flush
upon
my
face
and
remorse
in
my
*NL*
heart
,
but
Mr.
Mell
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
Steerforth
.
He
continued
to
pat
*NL*
me
kindly
on
the
shoulder
,
but
he
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
expect
me
,
Mr.
Creakle
,
to
justify
myself
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
*NL*
``
and
to
say
what
I
mean
,
--
what
I
have
to
say
is
,
that
his
mother
lives
*NL*
on
charity
in
an
alms-house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Mell
still
looked
at
him
,
and
still
patted
me
kindly
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
said
to
himself
,
in
a
whisper
,
if
I
heard
right
:
``
Yes
,
I
*NL*
thought
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
turned
to
his
assistant
,
with
a
severe
frown
and
labored
*NL*
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
hear
what
this
gentleman
says
,
Mr.
Mell
.
Have
the
goodness
,
if
*NL*
you
please
,
to
set
him
right
before
the
assembled
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
right
,
sir
,
without
correction
,
''
returned
Mr.
Mell
,
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
dead
silence
;
``
what
he
has
said
,
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
so
good
then
as
declare
publicly
,
will
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
*NL*
putting
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
rolling
his
eyes
round
the
school
,
*NL*
``
whether
it
ever
came
to
my
knowledge
until
this
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
not
directly
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
not
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
``
Do
n't
you
,
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
apprehend
you
never
supposed
my
worldly
circumstances
to
be
very
*NL*
good
,
''
replied
the
assistant
.
``
You
know
what
my
position
is
,
and
always
*NL*
has
been
,
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
apprehend
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
with
his
veins
*NL*
swelling
again
bigger
than
ever
,
``
that
you
've
been
in
a
wrong
position
*NL*
altogether
,
and
mistook
this
for
a
charity
school

Mr.
Mell
,
we
'll
part
*NL*
if
you
please
.
The
sooner
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
time
,
''
answered
Mr.
Mell
,
rising
,
``
like
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
to
you
!
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
my
leave
of
you
,
Mr.
Creakle
,
and
of
all
of
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Mell
,
*NL*
glancing
round
the
room
,
and
again
patting
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
``
James
Steerforth
,
the
best
wish
I
can
leave
you
is
that
you
may
come
to
*NL*
be
ashamed
of
what
you
have
done
to-day
.
At
present
I
would
prefer
to
*NL*
see
you
anything
rather
than
a
friend
,
to
me
,
or
to
any
one
in
whom
I
*NL*
feel
an
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
;
and
then
taking
his
flute
*NL*
and
a
few
books
from
his
desk
,
and
leaving
the
key
in
it
for
his
*NL*
successor
,
he
went
out
of
the
school
,
with
his
property
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
then
made
a
speech
,
through
Tungay
,
in
which
he
thanked
*NL*
Steerforth
for
asserting
-LRB-
though
perhaps
too
warmly
-RRB-
the
independence
*NL*
and
respectability
of
Salem
House
;
and
which
he
wound
up
by
shaking
*NL*
hands
with
Steerforth
,
while
we
gave
three
cheers
--
I
did
not
quite
know
*NL*
what
for
,
but
I
supposed
for
Steerforth
,
and
so
joined
in
them
ardently
,
*NL*
though
I
felt
miserable
.
Mr.
Creakle
then
caned
Tommy
Traddles
for
being
*NL*
discovered
in
tears
,
instead
of
cheers
,
on
account
of
Mr.
Mell
's
*NL*
departure
;
and
went
back
to
his
sofa
,
or
his
bed
,
or
wherever
he
had
*NL*
come
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
left
to
ourselves
now
,
and
looked
very
blank
,
I
recollect
,
on
*NL*
one
another
.
For
myself
,
I
felt
so
much
self-reproach
and
contrition
for
*NL*
my
part
in
what
had
happened
,
that
nothing
would
have
enabled
me
to
keep
*NL*
back
my
tears
but
the
fear
that
Steerforth
,
who
often
looked
at
me
,
I
*NL*
saw
,
might
think
it
unfriendly
--
or
,
I
should
rather
say
,
considering
our
*NL*
relative
ages
,
and
the
feeling
with
which
I
regarded
him
,
undutiful
--
if
*NL*
I
showed
the
emotion
which
distressed
me
.
He
was
very
angry
with
*NL*
Traddles
,
and
said
he
was
glad
he
had
caught
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Traddles
,
who
had
passed
the
stage
of
lying
with
his
head
upon
the
*NL*
desk
,
and
was
relieving
himself
as
usual
with
a
burst
of
skeletons
,
said
*NL*
he
did
n't
care
.
Mr.
Mell
was
ill-used
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
ill-used
him
,
you
girl
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
have
,
''
returned
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
?
''
retorted
Traddles
.
``
Hurt
his
feelings
,
and
lost
*NL*
him
his
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
feelings
!
''
repeated
Steerforth
disdainfully
.
``
His
feelings
will
*NL*
soon
get
the
better
of
it
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
His
feelings
are
not
like
*NL*
yours
,
Miss
Traddles
.
As
to
his
situation
--
which
was
a
precious
one
,
*NL*
was
n't
it
?
--
do
you
suppose
I
am
not
going
to
write
home
,
and
take
care
*NL*
that
he
gets
some
money
?
Polly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
thought
this
intention
very
noble
in
Steerforth
,
whose
mother
was
a
*NL*
widow
,
and
rich
,
and
would
do
almost
anything
,
it
was
said
,
that
he
*NL*
asked
her
.
We
were
all
extremely
glad
to
see
Traddles
so
put
down
,
and
*NL*
exalted
Steerforth
to
the
skies
:
especially
when
he
told
us
,
as
he
*NL*
condescended
to
do
,
that
what
he
had
done
had
been
done
expressly
for
*NL*
us
,
and
for
our
cause
;
and
that
he
had
conferred
a
great
boon
upon
us
by
*NL*
unselfishly
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
say
that
when
I
was
going
on
with
a
story
in
the
dark
that
*NL*
night
,
Mr.
Mell
's
old
flute
seemed
more
than
once
to
sound
mournfully
in
*NL*
my
ears
;
and
that
when
at
last
Steerforth
was
tired
,
and
I
lay
down
in
*NL*
my
bed
,
I
fancied
it
playing
so
sorrowfully
somewhere
,
that
I
was
quite
*NL*
wretched
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
forgot
him
in
the
contemplation
of
Steerforth
,
who
,
in
an
easy
*NL*
amateur
way
,
and
without
any
book
-LRB-
he
seemed
to
me
to
know
everything
by
*NL*
heart
-RRB-
,
took
some
of
his
classes
until
a
new
master
was
found
.
The
new
*NL*
master
came
from
a
grammar-school
;
and
before
he
entered
on
his
duties
,
*NL*
dined
in
the
parlor
one
day
to
be
introduced
to
Steerforth
.
Steerforth
*NL*
approved
of
him
highly
,
and
told
us
he
was
a
Brick
.
Without
exactly
*NL*
understanding
what
learned
distinction
was
meant
by
this
,
I
respected
*NL*
him
greatly
for
it
,
and
had
no
doubt
whatever
of
his
superior
knowledge
:
*NL*
though
he
never
took
the
pains
with
me
--
not
that
_
I
_
was
anybody
--
that
*NL*
Mr.
Mell
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
other
event
in
this
half-year
,
out
of
the
daily
*NL*
school-life
,
that
made
an
impression
on
me
which
still
survives
.
It
*NL*
survives
for
many
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
when
we
were
all
harassed
into
a
state
of
dire
confusion
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Creakle
was
laying
about
him
dreadfully
,
Tungay
came
in
,
and
*NL*
called
out
in
his
usual
strong
way
:
``
Visitors
for
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
words
were
interchanged
between
him
and
Mr.
Creakle
,
as
,
who
the
*NL*
visitors
were
,
and
what
room
they
were
to
be
shown
into
;
and
then
I
,
who
*NL*
had
,
according
to
custom
,
stood
up
on
the
announcement
being
made
,
and
*NL*
felt
quite
faint
with
astonishment
,
was
told
to
go
by
the
back
stairs
*NL*
and
get
a
clean
frill
on
,
before
I
repaired
to
the
dining-room
.
These
*NL*
orders
I
obeyed
,
in
such
a
flutter
and
hurry
of
my
young
spirits
as
I
*NL*
had
never
known
before
;
and
when
I
got
to
the
parlor-door
,
and
the
*NL*
thought
came
into
my
head
that
it
might
be
my
mother
--
I
had
only
thought
*NL*
of
Mr.
or
Miss
Murdstone
until
then
--
I
drew
back
my
hand
from
the
lock
,
*NL*
and
stopped
to
have
a
sob
before
I
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
saw
nobody
;
but
feeling
a
pressure
against
the
door
,
I
*NL*
looked
round
it
,
and
there
,
to
my
amazement
,
were
Mr.
Peggotty
and
Ham
,
*NL*
ducking
at
me
with
their
hats
,
and
squeezing
one
another
against
the
*NL*
wall
.
I
could
not
help
laughing
;
but
it
was
much
more
in
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
seeing
them
,
than
at
the
appearance
they
made
.
We
shook
hands
in
*NL*
a
very
cordial
way
;
and
I
laughed
and
laughed
,
until
I
pulled
out
my
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
and
wiped
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
-LRB-
who
never
shut
his
mouth
once
,
I
remember
,
during
the
*NL*
visit
-RRB-
showed
great
concern
when
he
saw
me
do
this
,
and
nudged
Ham
to
*NL*
say
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheer
up
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
bor
'
!
''
said
Ham
,
in
his
simpering
way
.
``
Why
,
how
*NL*
you
have
growed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
grown
?
''
I
said
,
drying
my
eyes
.
I
was
not
crying
at
anything
*NL*
particular
that
I
know
of
;
but
somehow
it
made
me
cry
to
see
old
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Growed
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
bor
'
?
Ai
n't
he
growed
!
''
said
Ham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
he
growed
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
me
laugh
again
by
laughing
at
each
other
,
and
then
we
all
*NL*
three
laughed
until
I
was
in
danger
of
crying
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
how
mama
is
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
I
said
.
``
And
how
my
dear
,
dear
,
*NL*
old
Peggotty
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oncommon
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
little
Em
`
ly
,
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
--
common
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
Mr.
Peggotty
,
to
relieve
it
,
took
two
prodigious
*NL*
lobsters
,
and
an
enormous
crab
,
and
a
large
canvas
bag
of
shrimps
,
out
*NL*
of
his
pockets
,
and
piled
them
up
in
Ham
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
knowing
as
you
was
partial
to
a
little
*NL*
relish
with
your
wittles
when
you
was
along
with
us
,
we
took
the
*NL*
liberty
.
The
old
Mawther
biled
'em
,
she
did
.
Mrs.
Gummidge
biled
'em
.
*NL*
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
slowly
,
who
I
thought
appeared
to
stick
to
the
*NL*
subject
on
account
of
having
no
other
subject
ready
,
``
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
I
*NL*
do
assure
you
,
she
biled
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
my
thanks
;
and
Mr.
Peggotty
,
after
looking
at
Ham
,
who
stood
*NL*
smiling
sheepishly
over
the
shell-fish
,
without
making
any
attempt
to
*NL*
help
him
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
come

you
see
,
the
wind
and
tide
making
in
our
favor

in
one
of

our

lugs
to
Gravesen
'
.
My
sister
she
wrote
to
me
the
name
*NL*
of
this
here
place
,
and
wrote
to
me
as
if
ever
I
chanced
to
come
to
*NL*
Gravesen
'
,
I
was
to
come
over
and
enquire
for
Mas

Davy
and
give
her
*NL*
dooty
,
humbly
wishing
him
well

reporting

and
so
*NL*
we
make
it
quite
a
merry-go-rounder

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
consider
a
little
before
I
understood
what
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
meant
by
this
figure
,
expressive
of
a
complete
circle
of
intelligence
.
I
*NL*
then
thanked
him
heartily
;
and
said
,
with
a
consciousness
of
reddening
,
*NL*
that
I
supposed
Little
Em
`

was
altered
too
,
since
we
used
to
pick
up
*NL*
shells
and
pebbles
on
the
beach

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

said
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
.
``
Ask

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
Ham
,
who
beamed
with
delight
and
assent
over
the
bag
of
*NL*
shrimps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her

said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
his
own
shining
like
a
light

*NL*
*NL*
``

said

Peggotty
.
``
Why
,
it
's
as
black
as
jet
!
And
so
*NL*
large
it
is
,
you
might
see
it
anywheres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perfectly
delightful
to
behold
with
what
enthusiasm
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
became
inspired
when
he
thought
of
his
little
favorite
.
He
stands
before
*NL*
me
again
,
his
bluff
hairy
face
irradiating
with
a
joyful
love
and
pride
,
*NL*
for
which
I
can
find
no
description
.
His
honest
eyes
fire
up
,
and
*NL*
sparkle
,
as
if
their
depths
were
stirred
by
something
bright
.
His
broad
*NL*
chest
heaves
with
pleasure
.
His
strong
loose
hands
clench
themselves
,
in
*NL*
his
earnestness
;
and
he
emphasises
what
he
says
with
a
right
arm
that
*NL*
shows
,
in
my
pigmy
view
,
like
a
sledge
hammer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
was
quite
as
earnest
as
he
.
I
dare
say
they
would
have
said
much
*NL*
more
about
her
,
if
they
had
not
been
abashed
by
the
unexpected
coming
in
*NL*
of
Steerforth
,
who
,
seeing
me
in
a
corner
speaking
with
two
strangers
,
*NL*
stopped
in
a
song
he
was
singing
,
and
said
:
``
I
did
n't
know
you
were
*NL*
here
,
young
Copperfield
!
''
-LRB-
for
it
was
not
the
usual
visiting
room
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
crossed
by
us
on
his
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
in
the
pride
of
having
such
a
friend
as
*NL*
Steerforth
,
or
in
the
desire
to
explain
to
him
how
I
came
to
have
such
a
*NL*
friend
as
Mr.
Peggotty
,
that
I
called
to
him
as
he
was
going
away
.
But
I
*NL*
said
,
modestly
--
Good
Heaven
,
how
it
all
comes
back
to
me
this
long
time
*NL*
afterwards
!
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
,
Steerforth
,
if
you
please
.
These
are
two
Yarmouth
*NL*
boatmen
--
very
kind
,
good
people
--
who
are
relations
of
my
nurse
,
and
*NL*
have
come
from
Gravesend
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
?
''
said
Steerforth
,
returning
.
``
I
am
glad
to
see
them
.
How
are
*NL*
you
both
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
ease
in
his
manner
--
a
gay
and
light
manner
it
was
,
but
not
*NL*
swaggering
--
which
I
still
believe
to
have
borne
a
kind
of
enchantment
*NL*
with
it
.
I
still
believe
him
,
in
virtue
of
this
carriage
,
his
animal
*NL*
spirits
,
his
delightful
voice
,
his
handsome
face
and
figure
,
and
,
for
*NL*
aught
I
know
,
of
some
inborn
power
of
attraction
besides
-LRB-
which
I
think
*NL*
a
few
people
possess
-RRB-
,
to
have
carried
a
spell
with
him
to
which
it
was
*NL*
a
natural
weakness
to
yield
,
and
which
not
many
persons
could
withstand
.
*NL*
I
could
not
but
see
how
pleased
they
were
with
him
,
and
how
they
seemed
*NL*
to
open
their
hearts
to
him
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
let
them
know
at
home
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Peggotty
,
''
I
said
,
*NL*
``
when
that
letter
is
sent
,
that
Mr.
Steerforth
is
very
kind
to
me
,
and
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
ever
do
here
without
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Steerforth
,
laughing
.
``
You
must
n't
tell
them
anything
*NL*
of
the
sort

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
Mr.
Steerforth
ever
comes
into
Norfolk
or
Suffolk
,
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
,
''
I
said
,
``
while
I
am
there
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
I
shall
*NL*
bring
him
to
Yarmouth
,
if

will
let
me
,
to
see
your
house
.
You
never
*NL*
saw
such
a
good
house

Steerforth

It

made

boat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Made
out
of

,
is
it
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
It
's
the
right
sort
of

house

such
a
thorough-built

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

Ham

grinning

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
was
no
less
pleased
than
his
nephew
,
though
his
modesty
*NL*
forbade
him
to
claim
a
personal
compliment
so
vociferously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
bowing
and
chuckling
,
and
tucking
in
the
ends
of
*NL*
his
neckerchief
at
his
breast
,
``
I
thankee

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

said
Steerforth
.
He
had
*NL*
got
his
name
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pound

,
it
's

said
Mr.

,
*NL*
shaking
his
head
,
``

at

along
with

'
r
Davy
to
see
it
.
I
'm
a
reg
`
lar
Dodman
,
I
*NL*
am
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
;
by
which
he
meant
snail
,
and
this
was
in
*NL*
allusion
to
his
being
slow
to
go
,
for
he
had
attempted
to
go
after
every
*NL*
sentence
,
and
had
somehow
or
other
come
back
again
;
``
but
I
wish
you
both
*NL*
well
,
and
I
wish
you
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
echoed
this
sentiment
,
and
we
parted
with
them
in
the
heartiest
*NL*
manner
.
I
was
almost
tempted
that
evening
to
tell
Steerforth
about
*NL*
pretty
little
Em
`
ly
,
but
I
was
too
timid
of
mentioning
her
name
,
and
too
*NL*
much
afraid
of
his
laughing
at
me
.
I
remember
that
I
thought
a
good
*NL*
deal
,
and
in
an
uneasy
sort
of
way
,
about
Mr.
Peggotty
having
said
that
*NL*
she
was
getting
on
to
be
a
woman
;
but
I
decided
that
was
nonsense
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
transported
the
shell-fish
,
or
the
``
relish
''
as
Mr.
Peggotty
had
*NL*
modestly
called
it
,
up
into
our
room
unobserved
,
and
made
a
great
supper
*NL*
that
evening
.
But
Traddles
could
n't
get
happily
out
of
it
.
He
was
too
*NL*
unfortunate
even
to
come
through
a
supper
like
anybody
else
.
He
was
*NL*
taken
ill
in
the
night
--
quite
prostrate
he
was
--
in
consequence
of
Crab
;
*NL*
and
after
being
drugged
with
black
draughts
and
blue
pills
,
to
an
extent
*NL*
which
Demple
-LRB-
whose
father
was
a
doctor
-RRB-
said
was
enough
to
undermine
a
*NL*
horse
's
constitution
,
received
a
caning
and
six
chapters
of
Greek
*NL*
Testament
for
refusing
to
confess
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
half-year
is
a
jumble
in
my
recollection
of
the
*NL*
daily
strife
and
struggle
of
our
lives
;
of
the
waning
summer
and
the
*NL*
changing
season
;
of
the
frosty
mornings
when
we
were
rung
out
of
bed
,
*NL*
and
the
cold
,
cold
smell
of
the
dark
nights
when
we
were
rung
into
*NL*
bed
again
;
of
the
evening
schoolroom
dimly
lighted
and
indifferently
*NL*
warmed
,
and
the
morning
schoolroom
which
was
nothing
but
a
great
*NL*
shivering-machine
;
of
the
alternation
of
boiled
beef
with
roast
beef
,
*NL*
and
boiled
mutton
with
roast
mutton
;
of
clods
of
bread-and-butter
,
*NL*
dog
's
-
eared
lesson-books
,
cracked
slates
,
tear-blotted
copy-books
,
*NL*
canings
,
rulerings
,
hair-cuttings
,
rainy
Sundays
,
suet
puddings
,
and
a
*NL*
dirty
atmosphere
of
ink
surrounding
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
well
remember
though
,
how
the
distant
idea
of
the
holidays
,
after
*NL*
seeming
for
an
immense
time
to
be
a
stationary
speck
,
began
to
come
*NL*
towards
us
,
and
to
grow
and
grow
.
How
,
from
counting
months
,
we
came
to
*NL*
weeks
,
and
then
to
days
;
and
how
I
then
began
to
be
afraid
that
I
should
*NL*
not
be
sent
for
,
and
,
when
I
learnt
from
Steerforth
that
I
_
had
_
been
*NL*
sent
for
and
was
certainly
to
go
home
,
had
dim
forebodings
that
I
might
*NL*
break
my
leg
first
.
How
the
breaking-up
day
changed
its
place
fast
,
at
*NL*
last
,
from
the
week
after
next
to
next
week
,
this
week
,
the
day
after
*NL*
to-morrow
,
to-morrow
,
to-day
,
to-night
--
when
I
was
inside
the
Yarmouth
*NL*
mail
,
and
going
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
many
a
broken
sleep
inside
the
Yarmouth
mail
,
and
many
an
*NL*
incoherent
dream
of
all
these
things
.
But
when
I
awoke
at
intervals
,
the
*NL*
ground
outside
the
window
was
not
the
playground
of
Salem
House
,
and
the
*NL*
sound
in
my
ears
was
not
the
sound
of
Mr.
Creakle
giving
it
to
Traddles
,
*NL*
but
the
sound
of
the
coachman
touching
up
the
horses
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
MY
HOLIDAYS
.
ESPECIALLY
ONE
HAPPY
AFTERNOON
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
arrived
before
day
at
the
inn
where
the
mail
stopped
,
which
was
*NL*
not
the
inn
where
my
friend
the
waiter
lived
,
I
was
shown
up
to
a
nice
*NL*
little
bedroom
,
with
DOLPHIN
painted
on
the
door
.
Very
cold
I
was
I
*NL*
know
,
notwithstanding
the
hot
tea
they
had
given
me
before
a
large
fire
*NL*
down-stairs
;
and
very
glad
I
was
to
turn
into
the
Dolphin
's
bed
,
pull
*NL*
the
Dolphin
's
blankets
round
my
head
,
and
go
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
the
carrier
was
to
call
for
me
in
the
morning
at
nine
*NL*
o'clock
.
I
got
up
at
eight
,
a
little
giddy
from
the
shortness
of
my
*NL*
night
's
rest
,
and
was
ready
for
him
before
the
appointed
time
.
He
*NL*
received
me
exactly
as
if
not
five
minutes
had
elapsed
since
we
were
*NL*
last
together
,
and
I
had
only
been
into
the
hotel
to
get
change
for
*NL*
sixpence
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
and
my
box
were
in
the
cart
,
and
the
carrier
seated
,
the
*NL*
lazy
horse
walked
away
with
us
all
at
his
accustomed
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
very
well
,
Mr.
Barkis
,
''
I
said
,
thinking
he
would
like
to
know
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
rubbed
his
cheek
with
his
cuff
,
and
then
looked
at
his
cuff
*NL*
as
if
he
expected
to
find
some
of
the
bloom
upon
it
;
but
made
no
other
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
your
message
,
Mr.
Barkis
,
''
I
said
;
``
I
wrote
to
Peggotty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
seemed
gruff
,
and
answered
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
right
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
I
asked
,
after
a
little
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
message
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
message
was
right
enough
,
perhaps
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
;
``
but
it
come
*NL*
to
an
end
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
understanding
what
he
meant
,
I
repeated
inquisitively
:
``
Came
to
an
*NL*
end
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
come
of
it
,
''
he
explained
,
looking
at
me
sideways
.
``
No
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
an
answer
expected
,
was
there
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
said
I
,
opening
*NL*
my
eyes
.
For
this
was
a
new
light
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
a
man
says
he
's
willin
'
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
turning
his
glance
*NL*
slowly
on
me
again
,
``
it
's
as
much
as
to
say
,
that
man
's
a
waitin
'
for
a
*NL*
answer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
carrying
his
eyes
back
to
his
horse
's
ears
;
*NL*
``
that
man
's
been
a
waitin
'
for
a
answer
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
told
her
so
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
no
,
''
growled
Mr.
Barkis
,
reflecting
about
it
.
``
I
ai
n't
got
no
call
*NL*
to
go
and
tell
her
so

I
never
said
six
words

her
myself
.
_
I
_
ai

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
me
to
do
it
,
Mr.
Barkis
?
''
said
I
,
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
tell
her
,
if
you
would
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
with
another
slow
*NL*
look
at
me
,
``
that
Barkis
was
a
waitin
'
for
a
answer

Says
you
--
what
name
*NL*
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
name

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
with
a
nod
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chrisen

?
Or

''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

it
's
not
her

name

Her
Christian
name
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
find
an
immense
fund
of
reflection
in
this
circumstance
,
*NL*
and
sat
pondering
and
inwardly
whistling
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
resumed
at
length
.
``
Says
you
,
`
Peggotty
!
Barkis
is
a
waitin
'
*NL*
for
a
answer
.
'
Says
she
,
perhaps
,
`
Answer
to
what
?
'
Says
you
,
`
To
what
I
*NL*
told
you
.
'
`
What
is
that
?
'
says
she
.
`
Barkis
is
willin
'
,
'
says
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
extremely
artful
suggestion
,
Mr.
Barkis
accompanied
with
a
nudge
of
*NL*
his
elbow
that
gave
me
quite
a
stitch
in
my
side
.
After
that
,
he
*NL*
slouched
over
his
horse
in
his
usual
manner
;
and
made
no
other
reference
*NL*
to
the
subject
except
,
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
*NL*
from
his
pocket
,
and
writing
up
,
inside
the
tilt
of
the
cart
,
``
Clara
*NL*
Peggotty
''
--
apparently
as
a
private
memorandum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
what
a
strange
feeling
it
was
to
be
going
home
when
it
was
not
home
,
*NL*
and
to
find
that
every
object
I
looked
at
,
reminded
me
of
the
happy
old
*NL*
home
,
which
was
like
a
dream
I
could
never
dream
again
!
The
days
when
my
*NL*
mother
and
I
and
Peggotty
were
all
in
all
to
one
another
,
and
there
was
*NL*
no
one
to
come
between
us
,
rose
up
before
me
so
sorrowfully
on
the
road
,
*NL*
that
I
am
not
sure
I
was
glad
to
be
there
--
not
sure
but
that
I
would
*NL*
rather
have
remained
away
,
and
forgotten
it
in
Steerforth
's
company
.
But
*NL*
there
I
was
;
and
soon
I
was
at
our
house
,
where
the
bare
old
elm
trees
*NL*
wrung
their
many
hands
in
the
bleak
wintry
air
,
and
shreds
of
the
old
*NL*
rooks
'
nests
drifted
away
upon
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carrier
put
my
box
down
at
the
garden
gate
,
and
left
me
.
I
walked
*NL*
along
the
path
towards
the
house
,
glancing
at
the
windows
,
and
fearing
*NL*
at
every
step
to
see
Mr.
Murdstone
or
Miss
Murdstone
lowering
out
of
one
*NL*
of
them
.
No
face
appeared
,
however
;
and
being
come
to
the
house
,
and
*NL*
knowing
how
to
open
the
door
,
before
dark
,
without
knocking
,
I
went
in
*NL*
with
a
quiet
,
timid
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
knows
how
infantine
the
memory
may
have
been
,
that
was
awakened
*NL*
within
me
by
the
sound
of
my
mother
's
voice
in
the
old
parlor
,
when
I
*NL*
set
foot
in
the
hall
.
She
was
singing
in
a
low
tone
.
I
think
I
must
have
*NL*
lain
in
her
arms
,
and
heard
her
singing
so
to
me
when
I
was
but
a
baby
.
*NL*
The
strain
was
new
to
me
,
and
yet
it
was
so
old
that
it
filled
my
heart
*NL*
brim-full
;
like
a
friend
come
back
from
a
long
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believed
,
from
the
solitary
and
thoughtful
way
in
which
my
mother
*NL*
murmured
her
song
,
that
she
was
alone
.
And
I
went
softly
into
the
room
.
*NL*
She
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
suckling
an
infant
,
whose
tiny
hand
she
*NL*
held
against
her
neck
.
Her
eyes
were
looking
down
upon
its
face
,
and
she
*NL*
sat
singing
to
it
.
I
was
so
far
right
,
that
she
had
no
other
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
spoke
to
her
,
and
she
started
,
and
cried
out
.
But
seeing
me
,
she
*NL*
called
me
her
dear
Davy
,
her
own
boy
!
and
coming
half
across
the
room
to
*NL*
meet
me
,
kneeled
down
upon
the
ground
and
kissed
me
,
and
laid
my
head
*NL*
down
on
her
bosom
near
the
little
creature
that
was
nestling
there
,
and
*NL*
put
its
hand
up
to
my
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
I
had
died
.
I
wish
I
had
died
then
,
with
that
feeling
in
my
*NL*
heart
!
I
should
have
been
more
fit
for
Heaven
than
I
ever
have
been
*NL*
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
your
brother
,
''
said
my
mother
,
fondling
me
.
``
Davy
,
my
pretty
boy
!
*NL*
My
poor
child
!
''
Then
she
kissed
me
more
and
more
,
and
clasped
me
round
*NL*
the
neck
.
This
she
was
doing
when
Peggotty
came
running
in
,
and
bounced
*NL*
down
on
the
ground
beside
us
,
and
went
mad
about
us
both
for
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
that
I
had
not
been
expected
so
soon
,
the
carrier
being
much
*NL*
before
his
usual
time
.
It
seemed
,
too
,
that
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
had
*NL*
gone
out
upon
a
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
would
not
return
before
*NL*
night
.
I
had
never
hoped
for
this
.
I
had
never
thought
it
possible
that
*NL*
we
three
could
be
together
undisturbed
,
once
more
;
and
I
felt
,
for
the
*NL*
time
,
as
if
the
old
days
were
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
dined
together
by
the
fireside
.
Peggotty
was
in
attendance
to
wait
*NL*
upon
us
,
but
my
mother
would
n't
let
her
do
it
,
and
made
her
dine
with
*NL*
us
.
I
had
my
own
old
plate
,
with
a
brown
view
of
a
man-of-war
in
full
*NL*
sail
upon
it
,
which
Peggotty
had
hoarded
somewhere
all
the
time
I
had
*NL*
been
away
,
and
would
not
have
had
broken
,
she
said
,
for
a
hundred
*NL*
pounds
.
I
had
my
own
old
mug
with
David
on
it
,
and
my
own
old
little
*NL*
knife
and
fork
that
would
n't
cut
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
at
table
,
I
thought
it
a
favorable
occasion
to
tell
*NL*
Peggotty
about
Mr.
Barkis
,
who
,
before
I
had
finished
what
I
had
to
tell
*NL*
her
,
began
to
laugh
,
and
threw
her
apron
over
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
!
''
said
my
mother
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
only
laughed
the
more
,
and
held
her
apron
tight
over
her
face
*NL*
when
my
mother
tried
to
pull
it
away
,
and
sat
as
if
her
head
were
in
a
*NL*
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
,
you
stupid
creature
?
''
said
my
mother
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
drat
the
man
!
''
cried
Peggotty
.
``
He
wants
to
marry
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
very
good
match
for
you
;
would
n't
it
?
''
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
Do
n't
ask
me
.
I
would
n't
have
him
if
*NL*
he
was
made
of
gold
.
Nor
I
would
n't
have
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
why
do
n't
you
tell
him
so
,
you
ridiculous
thing
?
''
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
so
,
''
retorted
Peggotty
,
looking
out
of
her
apron
.
``
He
has
*NL*
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
.
He
knows
better
.
If
he
was
to
make
so
*NL*
bold
as
say
a
word
to
me
,
I
should
slap
his
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
own
was
as
red
as
ever
I
saw
it
,
or
any
other
face
,
I
think
;
but
she
*NL*
only
covered
it
again
,
for
a
few
moments
at
a
time
,
when
she
was
taken
*NL*
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
;
and
after
two
or
three
of
those
attacks
,
*NL*
went
on
with
her
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remarked
that
my
mother
,
though
she
smiled
when
Peggotty
looked
at
*NL*
her
,
became
more
serious
and
thoughtful
.
I
had
seen
at
first
that
she
*NL*
was
changed
.
Her
face
was
very
pretty
still
,
but
it
looked
careworn
,
and
*NL*
too
delicate
;
and
her
hand
was
so
thin
and
white
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
be
almost
transparent
.
But
the
change
to
which
I
now
refer
was
*NL*
superadded
to
this
:
it
was
in
her
manner
,
which
became
anxious
and
*NL*
fluttered
.
At
last
she
said
,
putting
out
her
hand
,
and
laying
it
*NL*
affectionately
on
the
hand
of
her
old
servant
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
,
dear
,
you
are
not
going
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
ma'am
?
''
returned
Peggotty
,
staring
.
``
Lord
bless
you
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
just
yet
?
''
said
my
mother
,
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
''
cried
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
took
her
hand
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
leave
me
,
Peggotty
.
Stay
with
me
.
It
will
not
be
for
long
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
What
should
I
ever
do
without
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
leave
you
,
my
precious
!
''
cried
Peggotty
.
``
Not
for
all
the
world
and
*NL*
his
wife
.
Why
,
what
's
put
that
in
your
silly
little
head
?
''
--
For
Peggotty
*NL*
had
been
used
of
old
to
talk
to
my
mother
sometimes
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
mother
made
no
answer
,
except
to
thank
her
,
and
Peggotty
went
*NL*
running
on
in
her
own
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
leave
you
?
I
think
I
see
myself
.
Peggotty
go
away
from
you
?
I
should
*NL*
like
to
catch
her
at
it
!
No
,
no
,
no
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
shaking
her
head
,
*NL*
and
folding
her
arms
;
``
not
she
,
my
dear
.
It
is
n't
that
there
ai
n't
some
*NL*
Cats
that
would
be
well
enough
pleased
if
she
did
,
but
they
sha
n't
be
*NL*
pleased
.
They
shall
be
aggravated
.
I
'll
stay
with
you
till
I
am
a
cross
*NL*
cranky
old
woman
.
And
when
I
'm
too
deaf
,
and
too
lame
,
and
too
blind
,
*NL*
and
too
mumbly
for
want
of
teeth
,
to
be
of
any
use
at
all
,
even
to
be
*NL*
found
fault
with
,
then
I
shall
go
to
my
Davy
,
and
ask
him
to
take
me
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
Peggotty
,
''
says
I
,
``
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
,
and
I
'll
make
you
*NL*
as
welcome
as
a
queen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
your
dear
heart
!
''
cried
Peggotty
.
``
I
know
you
will
!
''
And
she
*NL*
kissed
me
beforehand
,
in
grateful
acknowledgment
of
my
hospitality
.
*NL*
After
that
,
she
covered
her
head
up
with
her
apron
again
,
and
had
*NL*
another
laugh
about
Mr.
Barkis
.
After
that
,
she
took
the
baby
out
*NL*
of
its
little
cradle
,
and
nursed
it
.
After
that
,
she
cleared
the
*NL*
dinner-table
;
after
that
,
came
in
with
another
cap
on
,
and
her
*NL*
work-box
,
and
the
yard-measure
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
candle
,
all
just
the
*NL*
same
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
round
the
fire
,
and
talked
delightfully
.
I
told
them
what
a
*NL*
hard
master
Mr.
Creakle
was
,
and
they
pitied
me
very
much
.
I
told
them
*NL*
what
a
fine
fellow
Steerforth
was
,
and
what
a
patron
of
mine
,
and
*NL*
Peggotty
said
she
would
walk
a
score
of
miles
to
see
him
.
I
took
the
*NL*
little
baby
in
my
arms
when
it
was
awake
,
and
nursed
it
lovingly
.
When
*NL*
it
was
asleep
again
,
I
crept
close
to
my
mother
's
side
according
to
*NL*
my
old
custom
,
broken
now
a
long
time
,
and
sat
with
my
arms
embracing
*NL*
her
waist
,
and
my
little
red
cheek
on
her
shoulder
,
and
once
more
felt
*NL*
her
beautiful
hair
drooping
over
me
--
like
an
angel
's
wing
as
I
used
to
*NL*
think
,
I
recollect
--
and
was
very
happy
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
sat
thus
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
and
seeing
pictures
in
the
*NL*
red-hot
coals
,
I
almost
believed
that
I
had
never
been
away
;
that
Mr.
*NL*
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
such
pictures
,
and
would
vanish
when
the
fire
*NL*
got
low
;
and
that
there
was
nothing
real
in
all
that
I
remembered
,
save
*NL*
my
mother
,
Peggotty
,
and
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
darned
away
at
a
stocking
as
long
as
she
could
see
,
and
then
*NL*
sat
with
it
drawn
on
her
left
hand
like
a
glove
,
and
her
needle
in
her
*NL*
right
,
ready
to
take
another
stitch
whenever
there
was
a
blaze
.
I
can
not
*NL*
conceive
whose
stockings
they
can
have
been
that
Peggotty
was
always
*NL*
darning
,
or
where
such
an
unfailing
supply
of
stockings
in
want
of
*NL*
darning
can
have
come
from
.
From
my
earliest
infancy
she
seems
to
have
*NL*
been
always
employed
in
that
class
of
needlework
,
and
never
by
any
*NL*
chance
in
any
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
who
was
sometimes
seized
with
a
fit
of
*NL*
wondering
on
some
most
unexpected
topic
,
``
what
's
become
of
Davy
's
*NL*
great-aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lor
,
Peggotty
!
''
observed
my
mother
,
rousing
herself
from
a
reverie
,
*NL*
``
what
nonsense
you
talk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
I
really
do
wonder
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
have
put
such
a
person
in
your
head
?
''
inquired
my
mother
.
``
Is
*NL*
there
nobody
else
in
the
world
to
come
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
unless
it
's
on
account
of
*NL*
being
stupid
,
but
my
head
never
can
pick
and
choose
its
people
.
They
*NL*
come
and
they
go
,
and
they
do
n't
come
and
they
do
n't
go
,
just
as
they
*NL*
like
.
I
wonder
what
's
become
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
absurd
you
are
,
Peggotty
,
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
One
would
suppose
*NL*
you
wanted
a
second
visit
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
forbid
!
''
cried
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
do
n't
talk
about
such
uncomfortable
things
,
there
's
a
good
*NL*
soul
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
Miss
Betsey
is
shut
up
in
her
cottage
by
the
*NL*
sea
,
no
doubt
,
and
will
remain
there
.
At
all
events
,
she
is
not
likely
*NL*
ever
to
trouble
us
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
mused
Peggotty
.
``
No
,
that
ai
n't
likely
at
all
.
--
I
wonder
,
if
she
*NL*
was
to
die
,
whether
she
'd
leave
Davy
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
me
,
Peggotty
,
''
returned
my
mother
,
``
what
a
nonsensical
*NL*
woman
you
are
!
when
you
know
that
she
took
offence
at
the
poor
dear
*NL*
boy
's
ever
being
born
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
she
would
n't
be
inclined
to
forgive
him
now
,
''
hinted
*NL*
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
she
be
inclined
to
forgive
him
now
?
''
said
my
mother
,
rather
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
he
's
got
a
brother
,
I
mean
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
immediately
began
to
cry
,
and
wondered
how
Peggotty
dared
to
*NL*
say
such
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
this
poor
little
innocent
in
its
cradle
had
ever
done
any
harm
to
*NL*
you
or
anybody
else
,
you
jealous
thing
!
''
said
she
.
``
You
had
much
better
*NL*
go
and
marry
Mr.
Barkis
,
the
carrier
.
Why
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
make
Miss
Murdstone
happy
,
if
I
was
to
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
bad
disposition
you
have
,
Peggotty
!
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
You
*NL*
are
as
jealous
of
Miss
Murdstone
as
it
is
possible
for
a
ridiculous
*NL*
creature
to
be
.
You
want
to
keep
the
keys
yourself
,
and
give
out
all
the
*NL*
things
,
I
suppose
?
I
should
n't
be
surprised
if
you
did
.
When
you
know
*NL*
that
she
only
does
it
out
of
kindness
and
the
best
intentions
!
You
know
*NL*
she
does
,
Peggotty
--
you
know
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
muttered
something
to
the
effect
of
``
Bother
the
best
*NL*
intentions
!
''
and
something
else
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
little
*NL*
too
much
of
the
best
intentions
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
mean
,
you
cross
thing
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
I
understand
*NL*
you
,
Peggotty
,
perfectly
.
You
know
I
do
,
and
I
wonder
you
do
n't
color
*NL*
up
like
fire
.
But
one
point
at
a
time
.
Miss
Murdstone
is
the
point
*NL*
now
,
Peggotty
,
and
you
sha
'n'
t
escape
from
it
.
Have
n't
you
heard
her
*NL*
say
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
she
thinks
I
am
too
thoughtless
and
*NL*
too
--
a
--
a
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
,
''
suggested
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returned
my
mother
,
half
laughing
,
``
and
if
she
is
so
silly
as
to
*NL*
say
so
,
can
I
be
blamed
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
says
you
can
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
should
hope
not
,
indeed
!
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
Have
n't
you
heard
*NL*
her
say
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
on
this
account
she
wishes
to
spare
*NL*
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
which
she
thinks
I
am
not
suited
for
,
and
*NL*
which
I
really
do
n't
know
myself
that
I
_
am
_
suited
for
;
and
is
n't
she
*NL*
up
early
and
late
,
and
going
to
and
fro
continually
--
and
does
n't
she
do
*NL*
all
sorts
of
things
,
and
grope
into
all
sorts
of
places
,
coal-holes
and
*NL*
pantries
and
I
do
n't
know
where
,
that
ca
n't
be
very
agreeable

and
do
*NL*
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
there
is
not
a
sort
of
devotion
in
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
insinuate
at
all
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
,
Peggotty
,
''
returned
my
mother
.
``
You
never
do
anything
else
,
*NL*
except
your
work
.
You
are
always
insinuating
.
You
revel
in
it
.
And
when
*NL*
you
talk
of
Mr.
Murdstone
's
good
intentions
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
talked
of
'em
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Peggotty
,
''
returned
my
mother
,
``
but
you
insinuated
.
That
's
what
I
*NL*
told
you
just
now
.
That
's
the
worst
of
you
.
You
_
will
_
insinuate
.
I
*NL*
said
,
at
the
moment
,
that
I
understood
you
,
and
you
see
I
did
.
When
you
*NL*
talk
of
Mr.
Murdstone
's
good
intentions
,
and
pretend
to
slight
them
-LRB-
for
*NL*
I
do
n't
believe
you
really
do
,
in
your
heart
,
Peggotty
-RRB-
,
you
must
be
as
*NL*
well
convinced
as
I
am
how
good
they
are
,
and
how
they
actuate
him
in
*NL*
everything
.
If
he
seems
to
have
been
at
all
stern
with
a
certain
person
,
*NL*
Peggotty
--
you
understand
,
and
so
I
am
sure
does
Davy
,
that
I
am
not
*NL*
alluding
to
any
body
present
--
it
is
solely
because
he
is
satisfied
that
*NL*
it
is
for
a
certain
person
's
benefit
.
He
naturally
loves
a
certain
*NL*
person
,
on
my
account
;
and
acts
solely
for
a
certain
person
's
good
.
He
*NL*
is
better
able
to
judge
of
it
than
I
am
;
for
I
very
well
know
that
I
am
*NL*
a
weak
,
light
,
girlish
creature
,
and
that
he
is
a
firm
,
grave
,
serious
*NL*
man
.
And
he
takes
,
''
said
my
mother
,
with
the
tears
which
were
engendered
*NL*
in
her
affectionate
nature
,
stealing
down
her
face
,
``
he
takes
great
*NL*
pains
with
me
;
and
I
ought
to
be
very
thankful
to
him
,
and
very
*NL*
submissive
to
him
even
in
my
thoughts
;
and
when
I
am
not
,
Peggotty
,
I
*NL*
worry
and
condemn
myself
,
and
feel
doubtful
of
my
own
heart
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
sat
with
her
chin
on
the
foot
of
the
stocking
,
looking
silently
*NL*
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Peggotty
,
''
said
my
mother
,
changing
her
tone
,
``
do
n't
let
us
fall
*NL*
out
with
one
another
,
for
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
You
are
my
true
friend
,
I
*NL*
know
,
if
I
have
any
in
the
world
.
When
I
call
you
a
ridiculous
creature
,
*NL*
or
a
vexatious
thing
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
Peggotty
,
I
only
mean
*NL*
that
you
are
my
true
friend
,
and
always
have
been
,
ever
since
the
night
*NL*
when
Mr.
Copperfield
first
brought
me
home
here
,
and
you
came
out
to
the
*NL*
gate
to
meet
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
was
not
slow
to
respond
,
and
ratified
the
treaty
of
friendship
*NL*
by
giving
me
one
of
her
best
hugs
.
I
think
I
had
some
glimpses
of
the
*NL*
real
character
of
this
conversation
at
the
time
;
but
I
am
sure
,
now
,
*NL*
that
the
good
creature
originated
it
,
and
took
her
part
in
it
,
merely
*NL*
that
my
mother
might
comfort
herself
with
the
little
contradictory
*NL*
summary
in
which
she
had
indulged
.
The
design
was
efficacious
;
for
I
*NL*
remember
that
my
mother
seemed
more
at
ease
during
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
that
Peggotty
observed
her
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
had
our
tea
,
and
the
ashes
were
thrown
up
,
and
the
candles
*NL*
snuffed
,
I
read
Peggotty
a
chapter
out
of
the
Crocodile
Book
,
in
*NL*
remembrance
of
old
times
--
she
took
it
out
of
her
pocket
:
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
she
had
kept
it
there
ever
since
--
and
then
we
talked
about
Salem
*NL*
House
,
which
brought
me
round
again
to
Steerforth
,
who
was
my
great
*NL*
subject
.
We
were
very
happy
;
and
that
evening
,
as
the
last
of
its
race
,
*NL*
and
destined
evermore
to
close
that
volume
of
my
life
,
will
never
pass
*NL*
out
of
my
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
almost
ten
o'clock
before
we
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
.
We
all
*NL*
got
up
then
;
and
my
mother
said
hurriedly
that
,
as
it
was
so
late
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
approved
of
early
hours
for
young
people
,
perhaps
*NL*
I
had
better
go
to
bed
.
I
kissed
her
,
and
went
up-stairs
with
my
candle
*NL*
directly
,
before
they
came
in
.
It
appeared
to
my
childish
fancy
,
as
I
*NL*
ascended
to
the
bedroom
where
I
had
been
imprisoned
,
that
they
brought
a
*NL*
cold
blast
of
air
into
the
house
which
blew
away
the
old
familiar
*NL*
feeling
like
a
feather
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
uncomfortable
about
going
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
,
as
I
*NL*
had
never
set
eyes
on
Mr.
Murdstone
since
the
day
when
I
committed
my
*NL*
memorable
offence
.
However
,
as
it
must
be
done
,
I
went
down
,
after
two
*NL*
or
three
false
starts
half-way
,
and
as
many
runs
back
on
tiptoe
to
my
*NL*
own
room
,
and
presented
myself
in
the
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
standing
before
the
fire
with
his
back
to
it
,
while
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
made
the
tea
.
He
looked
at
me
steadily
as
I
entered
,
but
made
*NL*
no
sign
of
recognition
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
up
to
him
,
after
a
moment
of
confusion
,
and
said
:
``
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
,
sir
.
I
am
very
sorry
for
what
I
did
,
and
I
hope
you
will
forgive
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
are
sorry
,
David
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
he
gave
me
was
the
hand
I
had
bitten
.
I
could
not
restrain
my
*NL*
eye
from
resting
for
an
instant
on
a
red
spot
upon
it
;
but
it
was
not
so
*NL*
red
as
I
turned
,
when
I
met
that
sinister
expression
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
to
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
me
!
''
sighed
Miss
Murdstone
,
giving
me
the
tea-caddy
scoop
*NL*
instead
of
her
fingers
.
``
How
long
are
the
holidays
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
month
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Counting
from
when
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
to-day
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
``
Then
here
's
_
one
_
day
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
a
calendar
of
the
holidays
in
this
way
,
and
every
morning
*NL*
checked
a
day
off
in
exactly
the
same
manner
.
She
did
it
gloomily
until
*NL*
she
came
to
ten
,
but
when
she
got
into
two
figures
she
became
more
*NL*
hopeful
,
and
,
as
the
time
advanced
,
even
jocular
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
this
very
first
day
that
I
had
the
misfortune
to
throw
her
,
*NL*
though
she
was
not
subject
to
such
weaknesses
in
general
,
into
a
state
*NL*
of
violent
consternation
.
I
came
into
the
room
where
she
and
my
mother
*NL*
were
sitting
;
and
the
baby
-LRB-
who
was
only
a
few
weeks
old
-RRB-
being
on
my
*NL*
mother
's
lap
,
I
took
it
very
carefully
in
my
arms
.
Suddenly
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
gave
such
a
scream
that
I
all
but
dropped
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jane
!
''
cried
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
Clara
,
do
you
see
?
''
exclaimed
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
what
,
my
dear
Jane
?
''
said
my
mother
;
``
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
it
!
''
cried
Miss
Murdstone
.
``
The
boy
has
got
the
baby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
limp
with
horror
;
but
stiffened
herself
to
make
a
dart
at
me
,
*NL*
and
take
it
out
of
my
arms
.
Then
,
she
turned
faint
;
and
was
so
very
ill
,
*NL*
that
they
were
obliged
to
give
her
cherry-brandy
.
I
was
solemnly
*NL*
interdicted
by
her
,
on
her
recovery
,
from
touching
my
brother
any
more
*NL*
on
any
pretence
whatever
;
and
my
poor
mother
,
who
,
I
could
see
,
wished
*NL*
otherwise
,
meekly
confirmed
the
interdict
,
by
saying
:
``
No
doubt
you
are
*NL*
right
,
my
dear
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
,
when
we
three
were
together
,
this
same
dear
*NL*
baby
--
it
was
truly
dear
to
me
,
for
our
mother
's
sake
--
was
the
innocent
*NL*
occasion
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
going
into
a
passion
.
My
mother
,
who
had
*NL*
been
looking
at
its
eyes
as
it
lay
upon
her
lap
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davy
!
come
here
!
''
and
looked
at
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Miss
Murdstone
lay
her
beads
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
,
''
said
my
mother
,
gently
,
``
they
are
exactly
alike
.
I
suppose
*NL*
they
are
mine
.
I
think
they
are
the
color
of
mine
.
But
they
are
*NL*
wonderfully
alike

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about

said
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jane
,
''
faltered
my
mother
,
a
little
abashed
by
the
harsh
tone
*NL*
of
this
inquiry
,
``
I
find
that
the
baby
's
eyes
and
Davy
's
are
exactly
*NL*
alike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
rising
angrily
,
``
you
are
a
positive
fool
*NL*
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jane
,
''
remonstrated
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
positive
fool
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
``
Who
else
could
compare
my
*NL*
brother
's
baby
with
your
boy
?
They
are
not
at
all
alike
.
They
are
*NL*
exactly
unlike
.
They
are
utterly
dissimilar
in
all
respects
.
I
hope
they
*NL*
will
ever
remain
so
.
I
will
not
sit
here
,
and
hear
such
comparisons
*NL*
made
.
''
With
that
she
stalked
out
,
and
made
the
door
bang
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
was
not
a
favorite
with
Miss
Murdstone
.
In
short
,
I
was
not
*NL*
a
favorite
there
with
anybody
,
not
even
with
myself
;
for
those
who
did
*NL*
like
me
could
not
show
it
,
and
those
who
did
not
,
showed
it
so
plainly
*NL*
that
I
had
a
sensitive
consciousness
of
always
appearing
constrained
,
*NL*
boorish
,
and
dull
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
made
them
as
uncomfortable
as
they
made
me
.
If
I
came
*NL*
into
the
room
where
they
were
,
and
they
were
talking
together
and
my
*NL*
mother
seemed
cheerful
,
an
anxious
cloud
would
steal
over
her
face
from
*NL*
the
moment
of
my
entrance
.
If
Mr.
Murdstone
were
in
his
best
humor
,
*NL*
I
checked
him
.
If
Miss
Murdstone
were
in
her
worst
,
I
intensified
*NL*
it
.
I
had
perception
enough
to
know
that
my
mother
was
the
victim
*NL*
always
;
that
she
was
afraid
to
speak
to
me
or
be
kind
to
me
,
lest
she
*NL*
should
give
them
some
offence
by
her
manner
of
doing
so
,
and
receive
a
*NL*
lecture
afterwards
;
that
she
was
not
only
ceaselessly
afraid
of
her
own
*NL*
offending
,
but
of
my
offending
,
and
uneasily
watched
their
looks
if
I
*NL*
only
moved
.
Therefore
I
resolved
to
keep
myself
as
much
out
of
their
*NL*
way
as
I
could
;
and
many
a
wintry
hour
did
I
hear
the
church-clock
*NL*
strike
,
when
I
was
sitting
in
my
cheerless
bedroom
,
wrapped
in
my
*NL*
little
great-coat
,
poring
over
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
sometimes
,
I
went
and
sat
with
Peggotty
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
There
I
was
comfortable
,
and
not
afraid
of
being
myself
.
But
neither
of
*NL*
these
resources
was
approved
of
in
the
parlor
.
The
tormenting
humor
*NL*
which
was
dominant
there
stopped
them
both
.
I
was
still
held
to
be
*NL*
necessary
to
my
poor
mother
's
training
,
and
,
as
one
of
her
trials
,
could
*NL*
not
be
suffered
to
absent
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
one
day
after
dinner
when
I
was
going
to
*NL*
leave
the
room
as
usual
;
``
I
am
sorry
to
observe
that
you
are
of
a
sullen
*NL*
disposition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
sulky
as
a
bear
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
still
,
and
hung
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
David
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
``
a
sullen
obdurate
disposition
is
,
of
*NL*
all
tempers

the
worst

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the

is

of
all
such
dispositions

ever
I

*NL*
remarked
his
sister
,
``
the
most
confirmed
and
stubborn

I
think

my

Clara

even
you
must
observe
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

said
my
mother
,
``

are
you
quite

sure

I
am
certain
you

excuse
me

that
you
understand
*NL*
Davy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
somewhat
ashamed
of
myself

Clara

returned
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
,
``
if
I
could
not
understand
the
boy

any
boy

I
do
n't
*NL*
profess
to
be
profound

I
do
lay
claim
to
common
sense

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my

returned
my

,
``
your

very
vigorous

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
!
Pray
do
n't
say
that

Clara

interposed
Miss
Murdstone
,
*NL*
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
sure
it
is
,
''
resumed
my
mother
;
``
and
everybody
knows
it
is
.
I
*NL*
profit
so
much
by
it
myself

in
many
ways

at

I
ought
to
--
that
no
*NL*
one
can
be
more
convinced
of
it
than
myself
;
and
therefore
I
speak
with
*NL*
great
diffidence
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
say
I
do
n't
understand
the

Clara

''
returned
Miss
Murdstone
,
*NL*
arranging
the
little
fetters
on
her
wrists
.
``
We
'll
agree
,
if
you

*NL*
that
I
do

He
is
much
too
deep
for
me
.
But
*NL*
perhaps
my
brother
's
penetration
may
enable
him
to
have
some
insight
*NL*
into
his
character

And
I
believe
my
brother
was
speaking
on
the
subject
*NL*
when
we
--
not
very
decently

interrupted
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Clara

''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
in
a
low
,
grave
voice
,
``
that
there
*NL*
may
be
better

more
dispassionate
judges

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward

replied
my

timidly
,
``
you
are
a

better
judge

I
pretend

I
only
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
only

he
replied

``
Try
not

do
it
again

my

keep
a
watch
upon

*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
's
lips
moved
,
as
if
she
answered
``
Yes
,
my
dear
Edward
,
''
but
*NL*
she
said
nothing
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sorry

David

remarked

said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
turning
his
head
*NL*
and
his
eyes
stiffly
towards
me
,
``
to
observe
that
you
are

a
sullen

This
is
not
a
character
that
I
can
suffer

develop
itself
*NL*
beneath
my
eyes
without
an
effort
at
improvement

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg

I
faltered

came
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
refuge
in
a
lie

he
returned
so
fiercely
,
that
I
saw
*NL*
my
mother
involuntarily
put
out
her
trembling
hand
as
if
to
interpose
*NL*
between
us
.
``
You

know
now

once
for
all

Further

will
have
it
done

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
gave
a
hoarse
chuckle

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
have
a
respectful

prompt

ready

he
*NL*
continued
,
``
and
towards
Jane

pleasure

child

Sit
down

*NL*
*NL*
He
ordered
me
like
a
dog
,
and
I
obeyed
like
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
more

he
said
.
``
I
observe
that
you
have
an
attachment

low
*NL*

common
company

You
are
not
to
associate
with

The
kitchen
*NL*
will
not
improve
you

in
the
many
respects
in
which
you
need
*NL*
improvement

Of
the
woman
who
abets
you
,
I
say
nothing

since
you

*NL*
Clara

''
addressing
my
mother
in
a
lower
voice
,
``
from
old
associations
*NL*
and
long-established
fancies

have
a
weakness
respecting
her
which
is
*NL*
not
yet
overcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
unaccountable
delusion
it
is
!
''
cried
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
say
,
''
he
resumed
,
addressing
me
,
``
that
I
disapprove
of
your
*NL*
preferring
such
company
as
Mistress
Peggotty
,
and
that
it
is
to
be
*NL*
abandoned
.
Now
,
David
,
you
understand
me
,

you
know
what
will
be
the
*NL*
consequence
if
you
fail
to
obey
me
to
the
letter

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
well
--
better
perhaps
than
he
thought
,
as
far
as
my
poor
mother
*NL*
was
concerned
--
and
I
obeyed
him
to
the
letter
.
I
retreated
to
my
own
*NL*
room
no
more
;
I
took
refuge
with
Peggotty
no
more
;
but
sat
wearily
in
*NL*
the
parlor
day
after
day
,
looking
forward
to
night
,
and
bedtime
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
irksome
constraint
I
underwent
,
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
hours
*NL*
upon
hours
,
afraid
to
move
an
arm
or
a
leg
lest
Miss
Murdstone
should
*NL*
complain
-LRB-
as
she
did
on
the
least
pretence
-RRB-
of
my
restlessness
,
and
*NL*
afraid
to
move
an
eye
lest
it
should
light
on
some
look
of
dislike
or
*NL*
scrutiny
that
would
find
new
cause
for
complaint
in
mine
!
What
*NL*
intolerable
dulness
to
sit
listening
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
;
and
*NL*
watching
Miss
Murdstone
's
little
shiny
steel
beads
as
she
strung
them
;
*NL*
and
wondering
whether
she
would
ever
be
married
,
and
if
so
,
to
what
sort
*NL*
of
unhappy
man
;
and
counting
the
divisions
in
the
moulding
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
;
and
wandering
away
,
with
my
eyes
,
to
the
ceiling
,
among
*NL*
the
curls
and
corkscrews
in
the
paper
on
the
wall
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
walks
I
took
alone
,
down
muddy
lanes
,
in
the
bad
winter
weather
,
*NL*
carrying
that
parlor
,
and
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
in
it
,
everywhere
:
a
*NL*
monstrous
load
that
I
was
obliged
to
bear
,
a
daymare
that
there
was
no
*NL*
possibility
of
breaking
in
,
a
weight
that
brooded
on
my
wits
,
and
*NL*
blunted
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
meals
I
had
in
silence
and
embarrassment
,
always
feeling
that
there
*NL*
were
a
knife
and
fork
too
many
,
and
that
mine
;
an
appetite
too
many
,
and
*NL*
that
mine
;
a
plate
and
chair
too
many
,
and
those
mine
;
a
somebody
too
*NL*
many
,
and
that
I
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
evenings
,
when
the
candles
came
,
and
I
was
expected
to
employ
*NL*
myself
,
but
,
not
daring
to
read
an
entertaining
book
,
pored
over
some
*NL*
hard-headed
,
harder-hearted
treatise
on
arithmetic
;
when
the
tables
of
*NL*
weights
and
measures
set
themselves
to
tunes
,
as
Rule
Britannia
,
or
Away
*NL*
with
Melancholy
;
and
would
n't
stand
still
to
be
learnt
,
but
would
go
*NL*
threading
my
grandmother
's
needle
through
my
unfortunate
head
,
in
at
one
*NL*
ear
and
out
at
the
other
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
yawns
and
dozes
I
lapsed
into
,
in
spite
of
all
my
care
;
what
starts
*NL*
I
came
out
of
concealed
sleeps
with
;
what
answers
I
never
got
,
to
little
*NL*
observations
that
I
rarely
made
;
what
a
blank
space
I
seemed
,
which
*NL*
everybody
overlooked
,
and
yet
was
in
everybody
's
way
;
what
a
heavy
*NL*
relief
it
was
to
hear
Miss
Murdstone
hail
the
first
stroke
of
nine
at
*NL*
night
,
and
order
me
to
bed
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
holidays
lagged
away
,
until
the
morning
came
when
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
said
:
``
Here
's
the
last
day
off
!
''
and
gave
me
the
closing
cup
*NL*
of
tea
of
the
vacation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
sorry
to
go
.
I
had
lapsed
into
a
stupid
state
;
but
I
was
*NL*
recovering
a
little
and
looking
forward
to
Steerforth
,
albeit
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
loomed
behind
him
.
Again
Mr.
Barkis
appeared
at
the
gate
,
and
*NL*
again
Miss
Murdstone
in
her
warning
voice
said
:
``
Clara
!
''
when
my
mother
*NL*
bent
over
me
,
to
bid
me
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kissed
her
,
and
my
baby
brother
,
and
was
very
sorry
then
;
but
not
*NL*
sorry
to
go
away
,
for
the
gulf
between
us
was
there
,
and
the
parting
was
*NL*
there
,
every
day
.
And
it
is
not
so
much
the
embrace
she
gave
me
,
that
*NL*
lives
in
my
mind
,
though
it
was
as
fervent
as
could
be
,
as
what
followed
*NL*
the
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
the
carrier
's
cart
when
I
heard
her
calling
to
me
.
I
looked
*NL*
out
,
and
she
stood
at
the
garden-gate
alone
,
holding
her
baby
up
in
her
*NL*
arms
for
me
to
see
.
It
was
cold
still
weather
;
and
not
a
hair
of
her
*NL*
head
,
or
a
fold
of
her
dress
,
was
stirred
,
as
she
looked
intently
at
me
,
*NL*
holding
up
her
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
lost
her
.
So
I
saw
her
afterwards
,
in
my
sleep
at
school
--
a
silent
*NL*
presence
near
my
bed
--
looking
at
me
with
the
same
intent
face
--
holding
*NL*
up
her
baby
in
her
arms
.

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
HAVE
A
MEMORABLE
BIRTHDAY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
pass
over
all
that
happened
at
school
,
until
the
anniversary
of
my
*NL*
birthday
came
round
in
March
.
Except
that
Steerforth
was
more
to
be
*NL*
admired
than
ever
,
I
remember
nothing
.
He
was
going
away
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
half-year
,
if
not
sooner
,
and
was
more
spirited
and
independent
than
*NL*
before
in
my
eyes
,
and
therefore
more
engaging
than
before
;
but
beyond
*NL*
this
I
remember
nothing
.
The
great
remembrance
by
which
that
time
is
*NL*
marked
in
my
mind
,
seems
to
have
swallowed
up
all
lesser
recollections
,
*NL*
and
to
exist
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
even
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
there
was
a
gap
of
full
two
*NL*
months
between
my
return
to
Salem
House
and
the
arrival
of
that
*NL*
birthday
.
I
can
only
understand
that
the
fact
was
so
,
because
I
know
it
*NL*
must
have
been
so
;
otherwise
I
should
feel
convinced
that
there
was
no
*NL*
interval
,
and
that
the
one
occasion
trod
upon
the
other
's
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
well
I
recollect
the
kind
of
day
it
was
!
I
smell
the
fog
that
hung
*NL*
about
the
place
;
I
see
the
hoar
frost
,
ghostly
,
through
it
;
I
feel
my
*NL*
rimy
hair
fall
clammy
on
my
cheek
;
I
look
along
the
dim
perspective
of
*NL*
the
schoolroom
,
with
a
sputtering
candle
here
and
there
to
light
up
the
*NL*
foggy
morning
,
and
the
breath
of
the
boys
wreathing
and
smoking
in
the
*NL*
raw
cold
as
they
blow
upon
their
fingers
,
and
tap
their
feet
upon
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
breakfast
,
and
we
had
been
summoned
in
from
the
playground
,
*NL*
when
Mr.
Sharp
entered
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
is
to
go
into
the
parlor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expected
a
hamper
from
Peggotty
,
and
brightened
at
the
order
.
Some
of
*NL*
the
boys
about
me
put
in
their
claim
not
to
be
forgotten
in
the
*NL*
distribution
of
the
good
things
,
as
I
got
out
of
my
seat
with
great
*NL*
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hurry
,
David
,
''
said
Mr.
Sharp
.
``
There
's
time
enough
,
my
boy
,
*NL*
do
n't
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
been
surprised
by
the
feeling
tone
in
which
he
spoke
,
if
I
*NL*
had
given
it
a
thought
;
but
I
gave
it
none
until
afterwards
.
I
hurried
*NL*
away
to
the
parlor
;
and
there
I
found
Mr.
Creakle
sitting
at
his
*NL*
breakfast
with
the
cane
and
a
newspaper
before
him
,
and
Mrs.
Creakle
*NL*
with
an
opened
letter
in
her
hand
.
But
no
hamper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Creakle
,
leading
me
to
a
sofa
,
and
*NL*
sitting
down
beside
me
.
``
I
want
to
speak
to
you
very
particularly
.
I
*NL*
have
something
to
tell
you
,
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
,
at
whom
of
course
I
looked
,
shook
his
head
without
looking
*NL*
at
me
,
and
stopped
up
a
sigh
with
a
very
large
piece
of
buttered
toast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
young
to
know
how
the
world
changes
every
day
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Creakle
,
``
and
how
the
people
in
it
pass
away
.
But
we
all
have
to
learn
*NL*
it
,
David
;
some
of
us
when
we
are
young
,
some
of
us
when
we
are
old
,
*NL*
some
of
us
at
all
times
of
our
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
her
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
came
away
from
home
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Creakle
,
after
a
pause
,
``
were
they
all
well
?
''
After
another
pause
,
``
Was
*NL*
your
mama
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
without
distinctly
knowing
why
,
and
still
looked
at
her
*NL*
earnestly
,
making
no
attempt
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
grieve
to
tell
you
that
I
hear
this
morning
your
*NL*
mama
is
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
mist
arose
between
Mrs.
Creakle
and
me
,
and
her
figure
seemed
to
move
*NL*
in
it
for
an
instant
.
Then
I
felt
the
burning
tears
run
down
my
face
,
*NL*
and
it
was
steady
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
dangerously
ill
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
all
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
need
to
tell
me
so
.
I
had
already
broken
out
into
a
*NL*
desolate
cry
,
and
felt
an
orphan
in
the
wide
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
kind
to
me
.
She
kept
me
there
all
day
,
and
left
me
alone
*NL*
sometimes
;
and
I
cried
,
and
wore
myself
to
sleep
,
and
awoke
and
cried
*NL*
again
.
When
I
could
cry
no
more
,
I
began
to
think
;
and
then
the
*NL*
oppression
on
my
breast
was
heaviest
,
and
my
grief
a
dull
pain
that
*NL*
there
was
no
ease
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
my
thoughts
were
idle
;
not
intent
on
the
calamity
that
weighed
*NL*
upon
my
heart
,
but
idly
loitering
near
it
.
I
thought
of
our
house
shut
*NL*
up
and
hushed
.
I
thought
of
the
little
baby
,
who
,
Mrs.
Creakle
said
,
had
*NL*
been
pining
away
for
some
time
,
and
who
,
they
believed
,
would
die
too
.
I
*NL*
thought
of
my
father
's
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
by
our
house
,
and
of
my
*NL*
mother
lying
there
beneath
the
tree
I
knew
so
well
.
I
stood
upon
a
chair
*NL*
when
I
was
left
alone
,
and
looked
into
the
glass
to
see
how
red
my
eyes
*NL*
were
,
and
how
sorrowful
my
face
.
I
considered
,
after
some
hours
were
*NL*
gone
,
if
my
tears
were
really
hard
to
flow
now
,
as
they
seemed
to
be
,
*NL*
what
,
in
connexion
with
my
loss
,
it
would
affect
me
most
to
think
of
*NL*
when
I
drew
near
home
--
for
I
was
going
home
to
the
funeral
.
I
am
*NL*
sensible
of
having
felt
that
a
dignity
attached
to
me
among
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
boys
,
and
that
I
was
important
in
my
affliction
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
ever
child
were
stricken
with
sincere
grief
,
I
was
.
But
I
remember
*NL*
that
this
importance
was
a
kind
of
satisfaction
to
me
,
when
I
walked
in
*NL*
the
playground
that
afternoon
while
the
boys
were
in
school
.
When
I
saw
*NL*
them
glancing
at
me
out
of
the
windows
,
as
they
went
up
to
their
*NL*
classes
,
I
felt
distinguished
,
and
looked
more
melancholy
,
and
walked
*NL*
slower
.
When
school
was
over
,
and
they
came
out
and
spoke
to
me
,
I
felt
*NL*
it
rather
good
in
myself
not
to
be
proud
to
any
of
them
,
and
to
take
*NL*
exactly
the
same
notice
of
them
all
,
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
to
go
home
next
night
;
not
by
the
mail
,
but
by
the
heavy
*NL*
night-coach
,
which
was
called
the
Farmer
,
and
was
principally
used
by
*NL*
country-people
travelling
short
intermediate
distances
upon
the
road
.
*NL*
We
had
no
story-telling
that
evening
,
and
Traddles
insisted
on
lending
*NL*
me
his
pillow
.
I
do
n't
know
what
good
he
thought
it
would
do
me
,
for
I
*NL*
had
one
of
my
own
:
but
it
was
all
he
had
to
lend
,
poor
fellow
,
except
*NL*
a
sheet
of
letter-paper
full
of
skeletons
;
and
that
he
gave
me
at
*NL*
parting
,
as
a
soother
of
my
sorrows
and
a
contribution
to
my
peace
of
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
Salem
House
upon
the
morrow
afternoon
.
I
little
thought
then
that
*NL*
I
left
it
,
never
to
return
.
We
travelled
very
slowly
all
night
,
and
did
*NL*
not
get
into
Yarmouth
before
nine
or
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
I
*NL*
looked
out
for
Mr.
Barkis
,
but
he
was
not
there
;
and
instead
of
him
a
*NL*
fat
,
short-winded
,
merry-looking
,
little
old
man
in
black
,
with
rusty
*NL*
little
bunches
of
ribbons
at
the
knees
of
his
breeches
,
black
stockings
,
*NL*
and
a
broad-brimmed
hat
,
came
puffing
up
to
the
coach
window
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
with
me
,
young
sir
,
if
you
please
,
''
he
said
,
opening
the
*NL*
door
,
``
and
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
hand
in
his
,
wondering
who
he
was
,
and
we
walked
away
to
a
*NL*
shop
in
a
narrow
street
,
on
which
was
written
OMER
,
DRAPER
,
TAILOR
,
*NL*
HABERDASHER
,
FUNERAL
FURNISHER
,
&
c
.
It
was
a
close
and
stifling
little
*NL*
shop
;
full
of
all
sorts
of
clothing
,
made
and
unmade
,
including
*NL*
one
window
full
of
beaver-hats
and
bonnets
.
We
went
into
a
little
*NL*
back-parlor
behind
the
shop
,
where
we
found
three
young
women
at
work
*NL*
on
a
quantity
of
black
materials
,
which
were
heaped
upon
the
table
,
and
*NL*
little
bits
and
cuttings
of
which
were
littered
all
over
the
floor
.
*NL*
There
was
a
good
fire
in
the
room
,
and
a
breathless
smell
of
warm
black
*NL*
crape
--
I
did
not
know
what
the
smell
was
then
,
but
I
know
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
young
women
,
who
appeared
to
be
very
industrious
and
*NL*
comfortable
,
raised
their
heads
to
look
at
me
,
and
then
went
on
with
*NL*
their
work
.
Stitch
,
stitch
,
stitch
.
At
the
same
time
there
came
from
*NL*
a
workshop
across
a
little
yard
outside
the
window
,
a
regular
sound
*NL*
of
hammering
that
kept
a
kind
of
tune
:
RAT
--
tat-tat
,
RAT
--
tat-tat
,
*NL*
RAT
--
tat-tat
,
without
any
variation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
my
conductor
to
one
of
the
three
young
women
.
``
How
do
you
*NL*
get
on
,
Minnie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
be
ready
by
the
trying-on
time
,
''
she
replied
gaily
,
without
*NL*
looking
up
.
``
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
,
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
took
off
his
broad-brimmed
hat
,
and
sat
down
and
panted
.
He
was
*NL*
so
fat
that
he
was
obliged
to
pant
some
time
before
he
could
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
''
said
Minnie
,
playfully
.
``
What
a
porpoise
you
do
grow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
my
dear
,
''
he
replied
,
considering
about
*NL*
it
.
``
I
_
am
_
rather
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
such
a
comfortable
man
,
you
see
,
''
said
Minnie
.
``
You
take
things
*NL*
so
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
use
taking
'em
otherwise
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
returned
his
daughter
.
``
We
are
all
pretty
gay
here
,
thank
*NL*
Heaven
!
Ai
n't
we
,
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
As
I
have
got
my
breath
now
,
I
*NL*
think
I
'll
measure
this
young
scholar
.
Would
you
walk
into
the
shop
,
*NL*
Master
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
preceded
Mr.
Omer
,
in
compliance
with
his
request
;
and
after
showing
*NL*
me
a
roll
of
cloth
which
he
said
was
extra
super
,
and
too
good
mourning
*NL*
for
anything
short
of
parents
,
he
took
my
various
dimensions
,
and
put
*NL*
them
down
in
a
book
.
While
he
was
recording
them
he
called
my
attention
*NL*
to
his
stock
in
trade
,
and
to
certain
fashions
which
he
said
had
``
just
*NL*
come
up
,
''
and
to
certain
other
fashions
which
he
said
had
``
just
gone
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
by
that
sort
of
thing
we
very
often
lose
a
little
mint
of
money
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
But
fashions
are
like
human
beings
.
They
come
in
,
nobody
*NL*
knows
when
,
why
,
or
how
;
and
they
go
out
,
nobody
knows
when
,
why
,
or
*NL*
how
.
Everything
is
like
life
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
*NL*
point
of
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
too
sorrowful
to
discuss
the
question
,
which
would
possibly
have
*NL*
been
beyond
me
under
any
circumstances
;
and
Mr.
Omer
took
me
back
into
*NL*
the
parlor
,
breathing
with
some
difficulty
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
called
down
a
little
break-neck
range
of
steps
behind
a
door
:
*NL*
``
Bring
up
that
tea
and
bread-and-butter
!
''
which
,
after
some
time
,
during
*NL*
which
I
sat
looking
about
me
and
thinking
,
and
listening
to
the
*NL*
stitching
in
the
room
and
the
tune
that
was
being
hammered
across
the
*NL*
yard
,
appeared
on
a
tray
,
and
turned
out
to
be
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
acquainted
with
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
after
watching
me
for
*NL*
some
minutes
,
during
which
I
had
not
made
much
impression
on
the
*NL*
breakfast
,
for
the
black
things
destroyed
my
appetite
,
``
I
have
been
*NL*
acquainted
with
you
a
long
time
,
my
young
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
your
life
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
I
may
say
before
it
.
I
knew
your
father
*NL*
before
you
.
He
was
five
foot
nine
and
a
half
,
and
he
lays
in
five

twen-ty

of

*NL*
*NL*
``
RAT

tat-tat

across
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

five

if
he
lays

*NL*
said
Mr.
Omer
,
pleasantly
.
``
It
was
either
his
request
or
her
direction
,
*NL*
I
forget
which
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
how
my
little
brother
is
,
sir
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
RAT
--
tat-tat
,
RAT
--
tat-tat
,
RAT
--
tat-tat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
in
his
mother
's
arms
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
poor
little
fellow
!
Is
he
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
it
more
than
you
can
help
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Yes
.
The
baby
's
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
wounds
broke
out
afresh
at
this
intelligence
.
I
left
the
*NL*
scarcely-tasted
breakfast
,
and
went
and
rested
my
head
on
another
table
*NL*
in
a
corner
of
the
little
room
,
which
Minnie
hastily
cleared
,
lest
I
*NL*
should
spot
the
mourning
that
was
lying
there
with
my
tears
.
She
was
a
*NL*
pretty
good-natured
girl
,
and
put
my
hair
away
from
my
eyes
with
a
soft
*NL*
kind
touch
;
but
she
was
very
cheerful
at
having
nearly
finished
her
*NL*
work
and
being
in
good
time
,
and
was
so
different
from
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
tune
left
off
,
and
a
good-looking
young
fellow
came
across
*NL*
the
yard
into
the
room
.
He
had
a
hammer
in
his
hand
,
and
his
mouth
was
*NL*
full
of
little
nails
,
which
he
was
obliged
to
take
out
before
he
could
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Joram
!
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
How
do
_
you
_
get
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Joram
.
``
Done
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
colored
a
little
,
and
the
other
two
girls
smiled
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
were
at
it
by
candle-light
last
night
,
when
I
was
at
the
*NL*
club
,
then
?
Were
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
shutting
up
one
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Joram
.
``
As
you
said
we
could
make
a
little
trip
of
it
,
and
*NL*
go
over
together
,
if
it
was
done
,
Minnie
and
me
--
and
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
thought
you
were
going
to
leave
me
out
altogether
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Omer
,
laughing
till
he
coughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
As
you
was
so
good
as
to
say
that
,
''
resumed
the
young
man
,
``
why
I
*NL*
turned
to
with
a
will
,
you
see
.
Will
you
give
me
your
opinion
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
rising
.
``
My
dear
;
''
and
he
stopped
and
turned
to
*NL*
me
;
``
would
you
like
to
see
your
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
father
,
''
Minnie
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
might
be
agreeable
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
But
perhaps
*NL*
you
're
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
ca
n't
say
how
I
knew
it
was
my
dear
,
dear
mother
's
coffin
that
they
*NL*
went
to
look
at
.
I
had
never
heard
one
making
;
I
had
never
seen
one
that
*NL*
I
know
of
:
but
it
came
into
my
mind
what
the
noise
was
,
while
it
was
*NL*
going
on
;
and
when
the
young
man
entered
,
I
am
sure
I
knew
what
he
had
*NL*
been
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
work
being
now
finished
,
the
two
girls
,
whose
names
I
had
not
heard
,
*NL*
brushed
the
shreds
and
threads
from
their
dresses
,
and
went
into
the
*NL*
shop
to
put
that
to
rights
,
and
wait
for
customers
.
Minnie
stayed
behind
*NL*
to
fold
up
what
they
had
made
,
and
pack
it
in
two
baskets
.
This
she
did
*NL*
upon
her
knees
,
humming
a
lively
little
tune
the
while
.
Joram
,
who
I
had
*NL*
no
doubt
was
her
lover
,
came
in
and
stole
a
kiss
from
her
while
she
was
*NL*
busy
-LRB-
he
did
n't
appear
to
mind
me
,
at
all
-RRB-
,
and
said
her
father
was
gone
*NL*
for
the
chaise
,
and
he
must
make
haste
and
get
himself
ready
.
Then
he
*NL*
went
out
again
;
and
then
she
put
her
thimble
and
scissors
in
her
pocket
,
*NL*
and
stuck
a
needle
threaded
with
black
thread
neatly
in
the
bosom
of
her
*NL*
gown
,
and
put
on
her
outer
clothing
smartly
,
at
a
little
glass
behind
*NL*
the
door
,
in
which
I
saw
the
reflection
of
her
pleased
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
I
observed
,
sitting
at
the
table
in
the
corner
with
my
head
*NL*
leaning
on
my
hand
,
and
my
thoughts
running
on
very
different
things
.
*NL*
The
chaise
soon
came
round
to
the
front
of
the
shop
,
and
the
baskets
*NL*
being
put
in
first
,
I
was
put
in
next
,
and
those
three
followed
.
I
*NL*
remember
it
as
a
kind
of
half
chaise-cart
,
half
piano-forte
van
,
painted
*NL*
of
a
sombre
color
,
and
drawn
by
a
black
horse
with
a
long
tail
.
There
*NL*
was
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
experienced
so
strange
a
feeling
in
my
life
*NL*
-LRB-
I
am
wiser
now
,
perhaps
-RRB-
as
that
of
being
with
them
,
remembering
how
*NL*
they
had
been
employed
,
and
seeing
them
enjoy
the
ride
.
I
was
not
angry
*NL*
with
them
;
I
was
more
afraid
of
them
,
as
if
I
were
cast
away
among
*NL*
creatures
with
whom
I
had
no
community
of
nature
.
They
were
very
*NL*
cheerful
.
The
old
man
sat
in
front
to
drive
,
and
the
two
young
people
*NL*
sat
behind
him
,
and
whenever
he
spoke
to
them
leaned
forward
,
the
one
on
*NL*
one
side
of
his
chubby
face
and
the
other
on
the
other
,
and
made
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
him
.
They
would
have
talked
to
me
too
,
but
I
held
back
,
and
*NL*
moped
in
my
corner
;
scared
by
their
love-making
and
hilarity
,
though
it
*NL*
was
far
from
boisterous
,
and
almost
wondering
that
no
judgment
came
upon
*NL*
them
for
their
hardness
of
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
when
they
stopped
to
bait
the
horse
,
and
ate
and
drank
and
enjoyed
*NL*
themselves
,
I
could
touch
nothing
that
they
touched
,
but
kept
my
fast
*NL*
unbroken
.
So
,
when
we
reached
home
,
I
dropped
out
of
the
chaise
behind
,
*NL*
as
quickly
as
possible
,
that
I
might
not
be
in
their
company
before
*NL*
those
solemn
windows
,
looking
blindly
on
me
like
closed
eyes
once
*NL*
bright
.
And
oh
,
how
little
need
I
had
had
to
think
what
would
move
me
to
*NL*
tears
when
I
came
back
--
seeing
the
window
of
my
mother
's
room
,
and
next
*NL*
it
that
which
,
in
the
better
time
,
was
mine
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
Peggotty
's
arms
before
I
got
to
the
door
,
and
she
took
me
into
*NL*
the
house
.
Her
grief
burst
out
when
she
first
saw
me
;
but
she
controuled
*NL*
it
soon
,
and
spoke
in
whispers
,
and
walked
softly
,
as
if
the
dead
could
*NL*
be
disturbed
.
She
had
not
been
in
bed
,
I
found
,
for
a
long
time
.
She
sat
*NL*
up
at
night
still
,
and
watched
.
As
long
as
her
poor
dear
pretty
was
*NL*
above
the
ground
,
she
said
,
she
would
never
desert
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
took
no
heed
of
me
when
I
went
into
the
parlor
where
he
*NL*
was
,
but
sat
by
the
fireside
,
weeping
silently
,
and
pondering
in
his
*NL*
elbow-chair
.
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
was
busy
at
her
writing-desk
,
which
was
*NL*
covered
with
letters
and
papers
,
gave
me
her
cold
finger-nails
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
,
in
an
iron
whisper
,
if
I
had
been
measured
for
my
mourning
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
:
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
shirts
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
;
``
have
you
brought
'em
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
I
have
brought
home
all
my
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
the
consolation
that
her
firmness
administered
to
me
.
I
do
*NL*
not
doubt
that
she
had
a
choice
pleasure
in
exhibiting
what
she
called
*NL*
her
self-command
,
and
her
firmness
,
and
her
strength
of
mind
,
and
her
*NL*
common
sense
,
and
the
whole
diabolical
catalogue
of
her
unamiable
*NL*
qualities
,
on
such
an
occasion
.
She
was
particularly
proud
of
her
turn
*NL*
for
business
;
and
she
showed
it
now
in
reducing
everything
to
pen
and
*NL*
ink
,
and
being
moved
by
nothing
.
All
the
rest
of
that
day
,
and
from
*NL*
morning
to
night
afterwards
,
she
sat
at
that
desk
;
scratching
composedly
*NL*
with
a
hard
pen
,
speaking
in
the
same
imperturbable
whisper
to
*NL*
everybody
;
never
relaxing
a
muscle
of
her
face
,
or
softening
a
tone
of
*NL*
her
voice
,
or
appearing
with
an
atom
of
her
dress
astray
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
took
a
book
sometimes
,
but
never
read
it
that
I
saw
.
He
*NL*
would
open
it
and
look
at
it
as
if
he
were
reading
,
but
would
remain
for
*NL*
a
whole
hour
without
turning
the
leaf
,
and
then
put
it
down
and
walk
to
*NL*
and
fro
in
the
room
.
I
used
to
sit
with
folded
hands
watching
him
,
and
*NL*
counting
his
footsteps
,
hour
after
hour
.
He
very
seldom
spoke
to
her
,
*NL*
and
never
to
me
.
He
seemed
to
be
the
only
restless
thing
,
except
the
*NL*
clocks
,
in
the
whole
motionless
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
days
before
the
funeral
,
I
saw
but
little
of
Peggotty
,
except
*NL*
that
,
in
passing
up
or
down
stairs
,
I
always
found
her
close
to
the
room
*NL*
where
my
mother
and
her
baby
lay
,
and
except
that
she
came
to
me
every
*NL*
night
,
and
sat
by
my
bed
's
head
while
I
went
to
sleep
.
A
day
or
two
*NL*
before
the
burial
--
I
think
it
was
a
day
or
two
before
,
but
I
am
*NL*
conscious
of
confusion
in
my
mind
about
that
heavy
time
,
with
nothing
to
*NL*
mark
its
progress
--
she
took
me
into
the
room
.
I
only
recollect
that
*NL*
underneath
some
white
covering
on
the
bed
,
with
a
beautiful
cleanliness
*NL*
and
freshness
all
around
it
,
there
seemed
to
me
to
lie
embodied
the
*NL*
solemn
stillness
that
was
in
the
house
;
and
that
when
she
would
have
*NL*
turned
the
cover
gently
back
,
I
cried
:
``
Oh
no
!
oh
no
!
''
and
held
her
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
funeral
had
been
yesterday
,
I
could
not
recollect
it
better
.
The
*NL*
very
air
of
the
best
parlor
,
when
I
went
in
at
the
door
,
the
bright
*NL*
condition
of
the
fire
,
the
shining
of
the
wine
in
the
decanters
,
the
*NL*
patterns
of
the
glasses
and
plates
,
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
cake
,
the
*NL*
odour
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
dress
,
and
our
black
clothes
.
Mr.
Chillip
is
*NL*
in
the
room
,
and
comes
to
speak
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
Master
David
?
''
he
says
,
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
tell
him
very
well
.
I
give
him
my
hand
,
which
he
holds
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
says
Mr.
Chillip
,
meekly
smiling
,
with
something
shining
in
*NL*
his
eye
.
``
Our
little
friends
grow
up
around
us
.
They
grow
out
of
our
*NL*
knowledge
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
makes
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
great
improvement
here
,
ma'am
?
''
says
Mr.
Chillip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
merely
answers
with
a
frown
and
a
formal
bend
;
Mr.
*NL*
Chillip
,
discomfited
,
goes
into
a
corner
,
keeping
me
with
him
,
and
opens
*NL*
his
mouth
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remark
this
,
because
I
remark
everything
that
happens
,
not
because
I
*NL*
care
about
myself
,
or
have
done
since
I
came
home
.
And
now
the
bell
*NL*
begins
to
sound
,
and
Mr.
Omer
and
another
come
to
make
us
ready
.
As
*NL*
Peggotty
was
wont
to
tell
me
,
long
ago
,
the
followers
of
my
father
to
*NL*
the
same
grave
were
made
ready
in
the
same
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
Mr.
Murdstone
,
our
neighbour
Mr.
Grayper
,
Mr.
Chillip
,
and
I
.
*NL*
When
we
go
out
to
the
door
,
the
Bearers
and
their
load
are
in
the
*NL*
garden
;
and
they
move
before
us
down
the
path
,
and
past
the
elms
,
and
*NL*
through
the
gate
,
and
into
the
church-yard
where
I
have
so
often
heard
*NL*
the
birds
sing
on
a
summer
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stand
around
the
grave
.
The
day
seems
different
to
me
from
every
*NL*
other
day
,
and
the
light
not
of
the
same
color
--
of
a
sadder
color
.
Now
*NL*
there
is
a
solemn
hush
,
which
we
have
brought
from
home
with
what
is
*NL*
resting
in
the
mould
;
and
while
we
stand
bare-headed
,
I
hear
the
voice
*NL*
of
the
clergyman
,
sounding
remote
in
the
open
air
,
and
yet
distinct
and
*NL*
plain
,
saying
:
``
I
am
the
Resurrection
and
the
Life
,
saith
the
Lord
!
''
*NL*
Then
I
hear
sobs
;
and
,
standing
apart
among
the
lookers-on
,
I
see
that
*NL*
good
and
faithful
servant
,
whom
of
all
the
people
upon
earth
I
love
the
*NL*
best
,
and
unto
whom
my
childish
heart
is
certain
that
the
Lord
will
one
*NL*
day
say
:
``
Well
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
faces
that
I
know
,
among
the
little
crowd
;
faces
that
I
*NL*
knew
in
church
,
when
mine
was
always
wondering
there
;
faces
that
first
*NL*
saw
my
mother
,
when
she
came
to
the
village
in
her
youthful
bloom
.
I
do
*NL*
not
mind
them
--
I
mind
nothing
but
my
grief
--
and
yet
I
see
and
know
them
*NL*
all
;
and
even
in
the
background
,
far
away
,
see
Minnie
looking
on
,
and
*NL*
her
eye
glancing
on
her
sweetheart
,
who
is
near
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
over
,
and
the
earth
is
filled
in
,
and
we
turn
to
come
away
.
Before
*NL*
us
stands
our
house
,
so
pretty
and
unchanged
,
so
linked
in
my
mind
with
*NL*
the
young
idea
of
what
is
gone
,
that
all
my
sorrow
has
been
nothing
to
*NL*
the
sorrow
it
calls
forth
.
But
they
take
me
on
;
and
Mr.
Chillip
talks
to
*NL*
me
;
and
when
we
get
home
,
puts
some
water
to
my
lips
;
and
when
I
ask
his
*NL*
leave
to
go
up
to
my
room
,
dismisses
me
with
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
I
say
,
is
yesterday
's
event
.
Events
of
later
date
have
floated
*NL*
from
me
to
the
shore
where
all
forgotten
things
will
reappear
,
but
this
*NL*
stands
like
a
high
rock
in
the
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
Peggotty
would
come
to
me
in
my
room
.
The
Sabbath
stillness
*NL*
of
the
time
-LRB-
the
day
was
so
like
Sunday
!
I
have
forgotten
that
-RRB-
was
*NL*
suited
to
us
both
.
She
sat
down
by
my
side
upon
my
little
bed
;
and
*NL*
holding
my
hand
,
and
sometimes
putting
it
to
her
lips
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
smoothing
it
with
hers
,
as
she
might
have
comforted
my
little
brother
,
*NL*
told
me
,
in
her
way
,
all
that
she
had
to
tell
concerning
what
had
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
never
well
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
for
a
long
time
.
She
was
uncertain
*NL*
in
her
mind
,
and
not
happy
.
When
her
baby
was
born
,
I
thought
at
first
*NL*
she
would
get
better
,
but
she
was
more
delicate
,
and
sunk
a
little
every
*NL*
day
.
She
used
to
like
to
sit
alone
before
her
baby
came
,
and
then
she
*NL*
cried
;
but
afterwards
she
used
to
sing
to
it
--
so
soft
,
that
I
once
*NL*
thought
,
when
I
heard
her
,
it
was
like
a
voice
up
in
the
air
,
that
was
*NL*
rising
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
got
to
be
more
timid
,
and
more
frightened-like
,
of
late
;
*NL*
and
that
a
hard
word
was
like
a
blow
to
her
.
But
she
was
always
the
same
*NL*
to
me
.
She
never
changed
to
her
foolish
Peggotty
,
did
n't
my
sweet
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Peggotty
stopped
,
and
softly
beat
upon
my
hand
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
time
that
I
saw
her
like
her
own
old
self
,
was
the
night
when
*NL*
you
came
home
,
my
dear
.
The
day
you
went
away
,
she
said
to
me
,
'
I
never
*NL*
shall
see
my
pretty
darling
again
.
Something
tells
me
so
,
that
tells
the
*NL*
truth
,
I
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
tried
to
hold
up
after
that
;
and
many
a
time
,
when
they
told
her
*NL*
she
was
thoughtless
and
light-hearted
,
made
believe
to
be
so
;
but
it
was
*NL*
all
a
bygone
then
.
She
never
told
her
husband
what
she
had
told
me
--
she
*NL*
was
afraid
of
saying
it
to
anybody
else
--
till
one
night
,
a
little
more
*NL*
than
a
week
before
it
happened
,
when
she
said
to
him
:
`
My
dear
,
I
think
*NL*
I
am
dying
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
's
off
my
mind
now
,
Peggotty
,
'
she
told
me
,
when
I
laid
her
in
her
*NL*
bed
that
night
.
`
He
will
believe
it
more
and
more
,
poor
fellow
,
every
*NL*
day
for
a
few
days
to
come
;
and
then
it
will
be
past
.
I
am
very
tired
.
*NL*
If
this
is
sleep
,
sit
by
me
while
I
sleep
:
do
n't
leave
me
.
God
bless
*NL*
both
my
children
!
God
protect
and
keep
my
fatherless
boy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
left
her
afterwards
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
``
She
often
talked
to
them
*NL*
two
down
stairs
--
for
she
loved
them
;
she
could
n't
bear
not
to
love
any
*NL*
one
who
was
about
her
--
but
when
they
went
away
from
her
bedside
,
she
*NL*
always
turned
to
me
,
as
if
there
was
rest
where
Peggotty
was
,
and
never
*NL*
fell
asleep
in
any
other
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
last
night
,
in
the
evening
,
she
kissed
me
,
and
said
:
`
If
my
baby
*NL*
should
die
too
,
Peggotty
,
please
let
them
lay
him
in
my
arms
,
and
bury
*NL*
us
together
.
'
-LRB-
It
was
done
;
for
the
poor
lamb
lived
but
a
day
beyond
*NL*
her
.
-RRB-
`
Let
my
dearest
boy
go
with
us
to
our
resting-place

'
she
said
,
*NL*
`
and
tell
him
that
his
mother
,
when
she
lay
here
,
blessed
him
not
once
,
*NL*
but
a
thousand
times
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
silence
followed
this
,
and
another
gentle
beating
on
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
pretty
far
in
the
night
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
when
she
asked
me
for
*NL*
some
drink
;
and
when
she
had
taken
it
,
gave
me
such
a
patient
smile
,
the
*NL*
dear
!
--
so
beautiful
!
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daybreak
had
come
,
and
the
sun
was
rising
,
when
she
said
to
me
,
how
*NL*
kind
and
considerate
Mr.
Copperfield
had
always
been
to
her
,
and
how
he
*NL*
had
borne
with
her
,
and
told
her
,
when
she
doubted
herself
,
that
a
*NL*
loving
heart
was
better
and
stronger
than
wisdom
,
and
that
he
was
a
*NL*
happy
man
in
hers
.
`
Peggotty
,
my
dear
,
'
she
said
then
,
`
put
me
nearer
to
*NL*
you
,
'
for
she
was
very
weak
.
`
Lay
your
good
arm
underneath
my
neck
,
'
she
*NL*
said
,
`
and
turn
me
to
you
,
for
your
face
is
going
far
off
,
and
I
want
it
*NL*
to
be
near
.
'
I
put
it
as
she
asked
;
and
oh
Davy
!
the
time
had
come
when
*NL*
my
first
parting
words
to
you
were
true
--
when
she
was
glad
to
lay
her
*NL*
poor
head
on
her
stupid
cross
old
Peggotty
's
arm
--
and
she
died
like
a
*NL*
child
that
had
gone
to
sleep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
Peggotty
's
narration
.
From
the
moment
of
my
knowing
of
the
*NL*
death
of
my
mother
,
the
idea
of
her
as
she
had
been
of
late
had
vanished
*NL*
from
me
.
I
remembered
her
,
from
that
instant
,
only
as
the
young
mother
*NL*
of
my
earliest
impressions
,
who
had
been
used
to
wind
her
bright
curls
*NL*
round
and
round
her
finger
,
and
to
dance
with
me
at
twilight
in
the
*NL*
parlor
.
What
Peggotty
had
told
me
now
,
was
so
far
from
bringing
me
back
*NL*
to
the
later
period
,
that
it
rooted
the
earlier
image
in
my
mind
.
It
may
*NL*
be
curious
,
but
it
is
true
.
In
her
death
she
winged
her
way
back
to
her
*NL*
calm
untroubled
youth
,
and
cancelled
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
who
lay
in
the
grave
,
was
the
mother
of
my
infancy
;
the
*NL*
little
creature
in
her
arms
,
was
myself
,
as
I
had
once
been
,
hushed
for
*NL*
ever
on
her
bosom
.

CHAPTER
X.
*NL*
*NL*
I
BECOME
NEGLECTED
,
AND
AM
PROVIDED
FOR
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
act
of
business
Miss
Murdstone
performed
when
the
day
of
the
*NL*
solemnity
was
over
,
and
light
was
freely
admitted
into
the
house
,
was
to
*NL*
give
Peggotty
a
month
's
warning
.
Much
as
Peggotty
would
have
disliked
*NL*
such
a
service
,
I
believe
she
would
have
retained
it
,
for
my
sake
,
in
*NL*
preference
to
the
best
upon
earth
.
She
told
me
we
must
part
,
and
told
me
*NL*
why
;
and
we
condoled
with
one
another
,
in
all
sincerity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
me
or
my
future
,
not
a
word
was
said
,
or
a
step
taken
.
Happy
they
*NL*
would
have
been
,
I
dare
say
,
if
they
could
have
dismissed
me
at
a
*NL*
month
's
warning
too
.
I
mustered
courage
once
,
to
ask
Miss
Murdstone
when
*NL*
I
was
going
back
to
school
;
and
she
answered
dryly
,
she
believed
I
was
*NL*
not
going
back
at
all
.
I
was
told
nothing
more
.
I
was
very
anxious
to
*NL*
know
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
me
,
and
so
was
Peggotty
;
but
neither
*NL*
she
nor
I
could
pick
up
any
information
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
change
in
my
condition
,
which
,
while
it
relieved
me
of
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
present
uneasiness
,
might
have
made
me
,
if
I
had
been
*NL*
capable
of
considering
it
closely
,
yet
more
uncomfortable
about
the
*NL*
future
.
It
was
this
.
The
constraint
that
had
been
put
upon
me
,
was
quite
*NL*
abandoned
.
I
was
so
far
from
being
required
to
keep
my
dull
post
in
the
*NL*
parlor
,
that
on
several
occasions
,
when
I
took
my
seat
there
,
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
frowned
to
me
to
go
away
.
I
was
so
far
from
being
warned
off
*NL*
from
Peggotty
's
society
,
that
,
provided
I
was
not
in
Mr.
Murdstone
's
,
I
*NL*
was
never
sought
out
or
inquired
for
.
At
first
I
was
in
daily
dread
of
*NL*
his
taking
my
education
in
hand
again
,
or
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
devoting
*NL*
herself
to
it
;
but
I
soon
began
to
think
that
such
fears
were
*NL*
groundless
,
and
that
all
I
had
to
anticipate
was
neglect
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
conceive
that
this
discovery
gave
me
much
pain
then
.
I
was
*NL*
still
giddy
with
the
shock
of
my
mother
's
death
,
and
in
a
kind
of
*NL*
stunned
state
as
to
all
tributary
things
.
I
can
recollect
,
indeed
,
to
*NL*
have
speculated
,
at
odd
times
,
on
the
possibility
of
my
not
being
taught
*NL*
any
more
,
or
cared
for
any
more
;
and
growing
up
to
be
a
shabby
moody
*NL*
man
,
lounging
an
idle
life
away
,
about
the
village
;
as
well
as
on
the
*NL*
feasibility
of
my
getting
rid
of
this
picture
by
going
away
somewhere
,
*NL*
like
the
hero
in
a
story
,
to
seek
my
fortune
:
but
these
were
transient
*NL*
visions
,
day
dreams
I
sat
looking
at
sometimes
,
as
if
they
were
faintly
*NL*
painted
or
written
on
the
wall
of
my
room
,
and
which
,
as
they
melted
*NL*
away
,
left
the
wall
blank
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
,
''
I
said
in
a
thoughtful
whisper
,
one
evening
,
when
I
was
*NL*
warming
my
hands
at
the
kitchen
fire
,
``
Mr.
Murdstone
likes
me
less
than
*NL*
he
used
to
.
He
never
liked
me
much
,
Peggotty
;
but
he
would
rather
not
*NL*
even
see
me
now
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
his
sorrow
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
stroking
my
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
Peggotty
,
I
am
sorry
too
.
If
I
believed
it
was
his
sorrow
,
I
*NL*
should
not
think
of
it
at
all
.
But
it
's
not
that
;
oh
,
no
,
it
's
not
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
it
's
not
that
?
''
said
Peggotty
,
after
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
his
sorrow
is
another
and
quite
a
different
thing
.
He
is
sorry
at
*NL*
this
moment
,
sitting
by
the
fireside
with
Miss
Murdstone
;
but
if
I
was
*NL*
to
go
in
,
Peggotty
,
he
would
be
something
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
he
be
?
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angry
,
''
I
answered
,
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
his
dark
frown
.
*NL*
``
If
he
was
only
sorry
,
he
would
n't
look
at
me
as
he
does
.
_
I
_
am
only
*NL*
sorry
,
and
it
makes
me
feel
kinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
said
nothing
for
a
little
while
;
and
I
warmed
my
hands
,
as
*NL*
silent
as
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davy
,
''
she
said
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
tried
,
my
dear
,
all
ways
I
could
think
of
--
all
the
ways
there
*NL*
are

and
all
the
ways
there
ai
n't
,
in
short
--
to
get
a
suitable
service
*NL*
here
,
in
Blunderstone
;
but
there
's
no
such
a
thing
,
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
mean
to
do
,
Peggotty
?
''
says
I
,
wistfully
.
``
Do
you
mean
*NL*
to
go
and
seek
your
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
I
shall
be
forced
to
go
to
Yarmouth

replied
Peggotty
,
``
and
*NL*
live
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
gone
farther
off

said
,
brightening
a
little
,
``

been
as
bad
as
lost

shall
see
you
sometimes

old
Peggotty

there

at

end

the
world

will
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Contrary
ways

please
God

cried
Peggotty
,
with
great
animation
.
``
As

long
as
you
are
here
,
my
pet
,
I
shall
come
over
every
week
of
my
life
to
*NL*
see
you
.
One
day
,
every
week
of
my
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
a
great
weight
taken
off
my
mind
by
this
promise
;
but
even
this
*NL*
was
not
all
,
for
Peggotty
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
going
,
Davy
,
you
see
,
to
my
brother
's
,
first
,
for
another
*NL*
fortnight
's
visit
--
just
till
I
have
had
time
to
look
about
me
,
and
get
*NL*
to
be
something
like
myself
again
.
Now
,
I
have
been
thinking
,
that
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
they
do
n't
want
you
here
at
present
,
you
might
be
let
to
go
*NL*
along
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
anything
,
short
of
being
in
a
different
relation
to
every
one
about
*NL*
me
,
Peggotty
excepted
,
could
have
given
me
a
sense
of
pleasure
at
that
*NL*
time
,
it
would
have
been
this
project
of
all
others
.
The
idea
of
being
*NL*
again
surrounded
by
those
honest
faces
,
shining
welcome
on
me
;
of
*NL*
renewing
the
peacefulness
of
the
sweet
Sunday
morning
,
when
the
bells
*NL*
were
ringing
,
the
stones
dropping
in
the
water
,
and
the
shadowy
ships
*NL*
breaking
through
the
mist
;
of
roaming
up
and
down
with
little
Em
`
ly
,
*NL*
telling
her
my
troubles
,
and
finding
charms
against
them
in
the
shells
*NL*
and
pebbles
on
the
beach
;
made
a
calm
in
my
heart
.
It
was
ruffled
next
*NL*
moment
,
to
be
sure
,
by
a
doubt
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
giving
her
consent
;
*NL*
but
even
that
was
set
at
rest
soon
,
for
she
came
out
to
take
an
evening
*NL*
grope
in
the
store-closet
while
we
were
yet
in
conversation
,
and
*NL*
Peggotty
,
with
a
boldness
that
amazed
me
,
broached
the
topic
on
the
*NL*
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
boy
will
be
idle
there
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
looking
into
a
*NL*
pickle-jar
,
``
and
idleness
is
the
root
of
all
evil
.
But
,
to
be
sure
,
he
*NL*
would
be
idle
here
--
or
anywhere
,
in
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
had
an
angry
answer
ready
,
I
could
see
;
but
she
swallowed
it
*NL*
for
my
sake
,
and
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
still
keeping
her
eye
on
the
pickles
;
*NL*
``
it
is
of
more
importance
than
anything
else
--
it
is
of
paramount
*NL*
importance
--
that
my
brother
should
not
be
disturbed
or
made
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
I
suppose
I
had
better
say
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
her
,
without
making
any
demonstration
of
joy
,
lest
it
should
*NL*
induce
her
to
withdraw
her
assent
.
Nor
could
I
help
thinking
this
a
*NL*
prudent
course
,
when
she
looked
at
me
out
of
the
pickle-jar
,
with
as
*NL*
great
an
access
of
sourness
as
if
her
black
eyes
had
absorbed
its
*NL*
contents
.
However
,
the
permission
was
given
,
and
was
never
retracted
;
*NL*
for
when
the
month
was
out
,
Peggotty
and
I
were
ready
to
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
came
into
the
house
for
Peggotty
's
boxes
.
I
had
never
known
*NL*
him
to
pass
the
garden-gate
before
,
but
on
this
occasion
he
came
into
*NL*
the
house
.
And
he
gave
me
a
look
as
he
shouldered
the
largest
box
and
*NL*
went
out
,
which
I
thought
had
meaning
in
it
,
if
meaning
could
ever
be
*NL*
said
to
find
its
way
into
Mr.
Barkis
's
visage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
was
naturally
in
low
spirits
at
leaving
what
had
been
her
home
*NL*
so
many
years
,
and
where
the
two
strong
attachments
of
her
life
--
for
my
*NL*
mother
and
myself
--
had
been
formed
.
She
had
been
walking
in
the
*NL*
churchyard
,
too
,
very
early
;
and
she
got
into
the
cart
,
and
sat
in
it
*NL*
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
she
remained
in
this
condition
,
Mr.
Barkis
gave
no
sign
of
*NL*
life
whatever
.
He
sat
in
his
usual
place
and
attitude
,
like
a
great
*NL*
stuffed
figure
.
But
when
she
began
to
look
about
her
,
and
to
speak
to
*NL*
me
,
he
nodded
his
head
and
grinned
several
times
.
I
have
not
the
least
*NL*
notion
at
whom
,
or
what
he
meant
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
day
,
Mr.
Barkis
!
''
I
said
,
as
an
act
of
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
bad
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
who
generally
qualified
his
speech
,
and
*NL*
rarely
committed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
is
quite
comfortable
now
,
Mr.
Barkis
,
''
I
remarked
,
for
his
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
,
though
!
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
reflecting
about
it
,
with
a
sagacious
air
,
Mr.
Barkis
eyed
her
,
*NL*
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Are
_
you
pretty
comfortable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
laughed
,
and
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
really
and
truly
,
you
know
.
Are
you
?
''
growled
Mr.
Barkis
,
sliding
*NL*
nearer
to
her
on
the
seat
,
and
nudging
her
with
his
elbow
.
``
Are
you
?
*NL*
Really
and
truly
pretty
comfortable
?
Are
you
?
Eh
?
''
At
each
of
these
*NL*
inquiries
Mr.
Barkis
shuffled
nearer
to
her
,
and
gave
her
another
nudge
;
*NL*
so
that
at
last
we
were
all
crowded
together
in
the
left-hand
corner
of
*NL*
the
cart
,
and
I
was
so
squeezed
that
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
calling
his
attention
to
my
sufferings
,
Mr.
Barkis
gave
me
a
*NL*
little
more
room
at
once
,
and
got
away
by
degrees
.
But
I
could
not
help
*NL*
observing
that
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
hit
upon
a
wonderful
expedient
*NL*
for
expressing
himself
in
a
neat
,
agreeable
,
and
pointed
manner
,
without
*NL*
the
inconvenience
of
inventing
conversation
.
He
manifestly
chuckled
over
*NL*
it
for
some
time
.
By-and-by
he
turned
to
Peggotty
again
,
and
repeating
,
*NL*
``
Are
you
pretty
comfortable
though
?
''
bore
down
upon
us
as
before
,
until
*NL*
the
breath
was
nearly
wedged
out
of
my
body
.
By-and-by
he
made
another
*NL*
descent
upon
us
with
the
same
inquiry
,
and
the
same
result
.
At
length
,
I
*NL*
got
up
whenever
I
saw
him
coming
,
and
standing
on
the
footboard
,
*NL*
pretended
to
look
at
the
prospect
;
after
which
I
did
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
polite
as
to
stop
at
a
public-house
,
expressly
on
our
account
,
*NL*
and
entertain
us
with
broiled
mutton
and
beer
.
Even
when
Peggotty
was
in
*NL*
the
act
of
drinking
,
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
approaches
,
and
*NL*
almost
choked
her
.
But
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
end
of
our
journey
,
he
*NL*
had
more
to
do
and
less
time
for
gallantry
;
and
when
we
got
on
Yarmouth
*NL*
pavement
,
we
were
all
too
much
shaken
and
jolted
,
I
apprehend
,
to
have
*NL*
any
leisure
for
any
thing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
and
Ham
waited
for
us
at
the
old
place
.
They
received
me
*NL*
and
Peggotty
in
an
affectionate
manner
,
and
shook
hands
with
Mr.
Barkis
,
*NL*
who
,
with
his
hat
on
the
very
back
of
his
head
,
and
a
shame-faced
leer
*NL*
upon
his
countenance
,
and
pervading
his
very
legs
,
presented
but
a
*NL*
vacant
appearance
,
I
thought
.
They
each
took
one
of
Peggotty
's
trunks
,
*NL*
and
we
were
going
away
,
when
Mr.
Barkis
solemnly
made
a
sign
to
me
with
*NL*
his
forefinger
to
come
under
an
archway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
growled
Mr.
Barkis
,
``
it
was
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
up
into
his
face
,
and
answered
,
with
an
attempt
to
be
very
*NL*
profound
:
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
n't
come
to
a
end
there
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
nodding
*NL*
confidentially
.
``
It
was
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
answered
:
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
who
was
willin
'
,
''
said
my
friend
.
``
It
was
Barkis
,
and
Barkis
*NL*
only
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
shaking
hands
;
``
I
'm
a
friend
of
*NL*
your
`
n
.
You
made
it
all
right
,
first
.
It
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
attempts
to
be
particularly
lucid
,
Mr.
Barkis
was
so
extremely
*NL*
mysterious
,
that
I
might
have
stood
looking
in
his
face
for
an
hour
,
and
*NL*
most
assuredly
should
have
got
as
much
information
out
of
it
as
out
of
*NL*
the
face
of
a
clock
that
had
stopped
,
but
for
Peggotty
's
calling
me
*NL*
away
.
As
we
were
going
along
,
she
asked
me
what
he
had
said
;
and
I
told
*NL*
her
he
had
said
it
was
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
his
impudence
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
but
I
do
n't
mind
that
!
Davy
dear
,
*NL*
what
should
you
think
if
I
was
to
think
of
being
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
I
suppose
you
would
like
me
as
much
then
,
Peggotty
,
as
you
do
*NL*
now
?
''
I
returned
,
after
a
little
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Greatly
to
the
astonishment
of
the
passengers
in
the
street
,
as
well
as
*NL*
of
her
relations
going
on
before
,
the
good
soul
was
obliged
to
stop
and
*NL*
embrace
me
on
the
spot
,
with
many
protestations
of
her
unalterable
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
should
you
say
,
darling
?
''
she
asked
again
,
when
this
was
*NL*
over
,
and
we
were
walking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
thinking
of
being
married
--
to
Mr.
Barkis
,
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
.
For
then
you
know
,
*NL*
Peggotty
,
you
would
always
have
the
horse
and
cart
to
bring
you
over
to
*NL*
see
me
,
and
could
come
for
nothing
,
and
be
sure
of
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sense
of
the
dear
!
''
cried
Peggotty
.
``
What
I
have
been
thinking
of
,
*NL*
this
month
back
!
Yes
,
my
precious
;
and
I
think
I
should
be
more
*NL*
independent
altogether
,
you
see
;
let
alone
my
working
with
a
better
*NL*
heart
in
my
own
house
,
than
I
could
in
anybody
else
's
now
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
I
might
be
fit
for
,
now
,
as
a
servant
to
a
stranger
.
And
I
shall
be
*NL*
always
near
my
pretty
's
resting-place
,
''
said
Peggotty
musing
,
``
and
able
*NL*
to
see
it
when
I
like
;
and
when
_
I
_
lie
down
to
rest
,
I
may
be
laid
not
*NL*
far
off
from
my
darling
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
neither
of
us
said
anything
for
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
would
n't
so
much
as
give
it
another
thought
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
*NL*
cheerily
,
``
if
my
Davy
was
anyways
against
it
--
not
if
I
had
been
asked
in
*NL*
church
thirty
times
three
times
over
,
and
was
wearing
out
the
ring
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
me
,
Peggotty
,
''
I
replied
;
``
and
see
if
I
am
not
really
glad
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
truly
wish
it
!
''
As
indeed
I
did
,
with
all
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
life
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
giving
me
a
squeeze
,
``
I
have
thought
of
*NL*
it
night
and
day
,
every
way
I
can
,
and
I
hope
the
right
way
;
but
I
'll
*NL*
think
of
it
again
,
and
speak
to
my
brother
about
it
,
and
in
the
meantime
*NL*
we
'll
keep
it
to
ourselves
,
Davy
,
you
and
me
.
Barkis
is
a
good
plain
*NL*
creetur
'
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
and
if
I
tried
to
do
my
duty
by
him
,
I
think
*NL*
it
would
be
my
fault
if
I
was
n't
--
if
I
was
n't
pretty
comfortable
,
''
said
*NL*
Peggotty
,
laughing
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
quotation
from
Mr.
Barkis
was
so
appropriate
,
and
tickled
us
both
*NL*
so
much
,
that
we
laughed
again
and
again
,
and
were
quite
in
a
pleasant
*NL*
humour
when
we
came
within
view
of
Mr.
Peggotty
's
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
looked
just
the
same
,
except
that
it
may
,
perhaps
,
have
shrunk
a
*NL*
little
in
my
eyes
;
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
waiting
at
the
door
as
if
she
*NL*
had
stood
there
ever
since
.
All
within
was
the
same
,
down
to
the
seaweed
*NL*
in
the
blue
mug
in
my
bedroom
.
I
went
into
the
out-house
to
look
about
*NL*
me
;
and
the
very
same
lobsters
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
possessed
by
the
*NL*
same
desire
to
pinch
the
world
in
general
,
appeared
to
be
in
the
same
*NL*
state
of
conglomeration
in
the
same
old
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
little
Em
`
ly
to
be
seen
,
so
I
asked
Mr.
Peggotty
where
*NL*
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
at
school
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
wiping
the
heat
consequent
on
*NL*
the
porterage
of
Peggotty
's
box
from
his
forehead
;
``
she
'll
be
home
,
''
*NL*
looking
at
the
Dutch
clock
,
``
in
from
twenty
minutes
to
half-an-hour
's
*NL*
time
.
We
all
on

the
loss
of
her

bless
ye

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
moaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheer
up
,
Mawther
!
''
cried
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
it
more
than
anybody
else
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
;
``
I
'm
a
lone
lorn
*NL*
creetur
'
,
and
she
used
to
be
a
`
most
the
only
think
that
did
n't
go
*NL*
contrairy
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
whimpering
and
shaking
her
head
,
applied
herself
to
*NL*
blowing
the
fire
.
Mr.
Peggotty
,
looking
round
upon
us
while
she
was
so
*NL*
engaged
,
said
in
a
low
voice
,
which
he
shaded
with
his
hand
:
``
The
old
*NL*
`
un
!
''
From
this
I
rightly
conjectured
that
no
improvement
had
taken
*NL*
place
since
my
last
visit
in
the
state
of
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
whole
place
was
,
or
it
should
have
been
,
quite
as
delightful
a
*NL*
place
as
ever
;
and
yet
it
did
not
impress
me
in
the
same
way
.
I
felt
*NL*
rather
disappointed
with
it
.
Perhaps
it
was
because
little
Em
`
ly
was
not
*NL*
at
home
.
I
knew
the
way
by
which
she
would
come
,
and
presently
found
*NL*
myself
strolling
along
the
path
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
figure
appeared
in
the
distance
before
long
,
and
I
soon
knew
it
to
be
*NL*
Em
`
ly
,
who
was
a
little
creature
still
in
stature
,
though
she
was
grown
.
*NL*
But
when
she
drew
nearer
,
and
I
saw
her
blue
eyes
looking
bluer
,
and
her
*NL*
dimpled
face
looking
brighter
,
and
her
whole
self
prettier
and
gayer
,
a
*NL*
curious
feeling
came
over
me
that
made
me
pretend
not
to
know
her
,
and
*NL*
pass
by
as
if
I
were
looking
at
something
a
long
way
off
.
I
have
done
*NL*
such
a
thing
since
in
later
life
,
or
I
am
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Em
`
ly
did
n't
care
a
bit
.
She
saw
me
well
enough
;
but
instead
of
*NL*
turning
round
and
calling
after
me
,
ran
away
laughing
.
This
obliged
me
*NL*
to
run
after
her
,
and
she
ran
so
fast
that
we
were
very
near
the
cottage
*NL*
before
I
caught
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
''
said
little
Em
`
ly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
knew
who
it
was
,
Em
`
ly
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
n't
_
you
_
know
who
it
was
?
''
said
Em
`
ly
.
I
was
going
to
kiss
her
,
*NL*
but
she
covered
her
cherry
lips
with
her
hands
,
and
said
she
was
n't
a
*NL*
baby
now
,
and
ran
away
,
laughing
more
than
ever
,
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
delight
in
teasing
me
,
which
was
a
change
in
her
I
*NL*
wondered
at
very
much
.
The
tea-table
was
ready
,
and
our
little
locker
*NL*
was
put
out
in
its
old
place
,
but
instead
of
coming
to
sit
by
me
,
she
*NL*
went
and
bestowed
her
company
upon
that
grumbling
Mrs.
Gummidge
:
and
on
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
's
inquiring
why
,
rumpled
her
hair
all
over
her
face
to
hide
*NL*
it
,
and
would
do
nothing
but
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
puss
,
it
is
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
patting
her
with
his
great
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
sh
'
is
!
so
sh
'
is
!
''
cried
Ham
.
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
bor
'
,
so
sh
`
is
!
''
and
he
*NL*
sat
and
chuckled
at
her
for
some
time
,
in
a
state
of
mingled
admiration
*NL*
and
delight
,
that
made
his
face
a
burning
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Em
`
ly
was
spoiled
by
them
all
,
in
fact
;
and
by
no
one
more
than
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
himself
,
whom
she
could
have
coaxed
into
anything
,
by
only
*NL*
going
and
laying
her
cheek
against
his
rough
whisker
.
That
was
my
*NL*
opinion
,
at
least
,
when
I
saw
her
do
it
;
and
I
held
Mr.
Peggotty
to
be
*NL*
thoroughly
in
the
right
.
But
she
was
so
affectionate
and
sweet-natured
,
*NL*
and
had
such
a
pleasant
manner
of
being
both
sly
and
shy
at
once
,
that
*NL*
she
captivated
me
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
tender-hearted
,
too
;
for
when
,
as
we
sat
round
the
fire
after
*NL*
tea
,
an
allusion
was
made
by
Mr.
Peggotty
over
his
pipe
to
the
loss
I
*NL*
had
sustained
,
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
,
and
she
looked
at
me
so
*NL*
kindly
across
the
table
,
that
I
felt
quite
thankful
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
taking
up
her
curls
,
and
running
them
over
his
*NL*
hand
like
water
,
``
here
's
another
orphan
,
you
see
,
sir
.
And
here
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
,
giving
Ham
a
back-handed
knock
in
the
chest
,
``
is
another
*NL*
of
'em
,
though
he
do
n't
look
much
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
you
for
my
guardian
,
Mr.
Peggotty
,
''
said
I
,
shaking
my
head
,
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
should
_
feel
_
much
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
bor
'
!
''
cried
Ham
,
in
an
ecstasy
.
``
Hoorah
!
Well
*NL*
said
!
Nor
more
you
would
n't
!
Hor
!
Hor
!
''
--
Here
he
returned
Mr.
Peggotty
's
*NL*
back-hander
,
and
little
Em
`
ly
got
up
and
kissed
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
's
your
friend
,
sir
?
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Steerforth
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
name
!
''
cried
Mr.
Peggotty
,
turning
to
Ham
.
``
I
knowed
it
was
*NL*
something
in
our
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
it
was
Rudderford
,
''
observed
Ham
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
retorted
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
And
ye
steer
with
a
rudder
,
do
n't
ye
?
It
*NL*
ai
n't
fur
off

How
is
he
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
very
well
indeed
when
I
came
away
,
Mr.
Peggotty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
friend
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
stretching
out
his
pipe
.
``
There
's
*NL*
a
friend

if
you
talk
of
friends

Why
,
Lord
love
my
heart
alive

if
it
*NL*
ai
n't
a
treat
to
look
at
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
handsome
,
is
he
not
?
''
said
I
,
my
heart
warming
with
this
*NL*
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
!
''
cried
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
He
stands
up

He
's
so
bold

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
That
's
just
his
character
,
''
said
I.
``
He
's
as
brave
as
a
lion

and
*NL*
you
ca
n't
think
how
frank
he
is

Mr.
Peggotty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
suppose
,
now
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
looking
at
me
through
the
*NL*
smoke
of
his
pipe
,
``
that
in
the
way
of
book-learning
he
'd
take
the
wind
*NL*
out
of
a
`
most
anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
delighted
;
``
he
knows
everything
.
He
is
astonishingly
*NL*
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
friend
!
''
murmured
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
a
grave
toss
of
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
seems
to
cost
him
any
trouble
,
''
said
I.
``
He
knows
a
task
if
he
*NL*
only
looks
at
it
.
He
is
the
best
cricketer
you
ever
saw
.
He
will
give
*NL*
you
almost
as
many
men
as
you
like
at
draughts
,
and
beat
you
easily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
gave
his
head
another
toss
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
``
Of
course
*NL*
he
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
such
a
speaker
,
''
I
pursued
,
``
that
he
can
win
anybody
over
;
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
you
'd
say
if
you
were
to
hear
him
sing

Mr.
Peggotty

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
gave
his
head
another
toss
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
``
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
he
's
such
a
generous
,
fine
,
noble
fellow
,
''
said
I
,
quite
carried
*NL*
away
by
my
favorite
theme
,
``
that
it
's
hardly
possible
to
give
him
as
*NL*
much
praise
as
he
deserves

I
am
sure
I
can
never
feel
thankful
enough
*NL*
for
the
generosity
with
which
he
has
protected
me
,
so
much
younger
and
*NL*
lower
in
the
school
than
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
running
on
,
very
fast
indeed
,
when
my
eyes
rested
on
little
*NL*
Em
`
ly
's
face
,
which
was
bent
forward
over
the
table
,
listening
with
the
*NL*
deepest
attention
,
her
breath
held
,
her
blue
eyes
sparkling
like
jewels
,
*NL*
and
the
color
mantling
in
her
cheeks
.
She
looked
so
extraordinarily
*NL*
earnest
and
pretty
,
that
I
stopped
in
a
sort
of
wonder
;
and
they
all
*NL*
observed
her
at
the
same
time
,
for
,
as
I
stopped
,
they
laughed
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Em
`
ly
is
like
me
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
and
would
like
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Em
`
ly
was
confused
by
our
all
observing
her
,
and
hung
down
her
head
,
and
*NL*
her
face
was
covered
with
blushes
.
Glancing
up
presently
through
her
*NL*
stray
curls
,
and
seeing
that
we
were
all
looking
at
her
still
-LRB-
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
I
,
for
one
,
could
have
looked
at
her
for
hours
-RRB-
,
she
ran
away
,
and
*NL*
kept
away
till
it
was
nearly
bedtime
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
down
in
the
old
little
bed
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
,
and
the
wind
*NL*
came
moaning
on
across
the
flat
as
it
had
done
before
.
But
I
could
not
*NL*
help
fancying
,
now
,
that
it
moaned
of
those
who
were
gone
;
and
instead
*NL*
of
thinking
that
the
sea
might
rise
in
the
night
and
float
the
boat
*NL*
away
,
I
thought
of
the
sea
that
had
risen
,
since
I
last
heard
those
*NL*
sounds
,
and
drowned
my
happy
home
.
I
recollect
,
as
the
wind
and
water
*NL*
began
to
sound
fainter
in
my
ears
,
putting
a
short
clause
into
my
*NL*
prayers
,
petitioning
that
I
might
grow
up
to
marry
little
Em
`
ly
,
and
so
*NL*
dropping
lovingly
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
passed
pretty
much
as
they
had
passed
before
,
except
--
it
was
a
*NL*
great
exception
--
that
little
Em
`
ly
and
I
seldom
wandered
on
the
beach
*NL*
now
.
She
had
tasks
to
learn
,
and
needle-work
to
do
;
and
was
absent
*NL*
during
a
great
part
of
each
day
.
But
I
felt
that
we
should
not
have
had
*NL*
those
old
wanderings
,
even
if
it
had
been
otherwise
.
Wild
and
full
of
*NL*
childish
whims
as
Em
`
ly
was
,
she
was
more
of
a
little
woman
than
I
had
*NL*
supposed
.
She
seemed
to
have
got
a
great
distance
away
from
me
,
in
*NL*
little
more
than
a
year
.
She
liked
me
,
but
she
laughed
at
me
,
and
*NL*
tormented
me
;
and
when
I
went
to
meet
her
,
stole
home
another
way
,
and
*NL*
was
laughing
at
the
door
when
I
came
back
,
disappointed
.
The
best
times
*NL*
were
when
she
sat
quietly
at
work
in
the
doorway
,
and
I
sat
on
the
*NL*
wooden
step
at
her
feet
,
reading
to
her
.
It
seems
to
me
,
at
this
hour
,
*NL*
that
I
have
never
seen
such
sunlight
as
on
those
bright
April
*NL*
afternoons
;
that
I
have
never
seen
such
a
sunny
little
figure
as
I
used
*NL*
to
see
,
sitting
in
the
doorway
of
the
old
boat
;
that
I
have
never
beheld
*NL*
such
sky
,
such
water
,
such
glorified
ships
sailing
away
into
golden
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
very
first
evening
after
our
arrival
,
Mr.
Barkis
appeared
in
an
*NL*
exceedingly
vacant
and
awkward
condition
,
and
with
a
bundle
of
oranges
*NL*
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
.
As
he
made
no
allusion
of
any
kind
to
this
*NL*
property
,
he
was
supposed
to
have
left
it
behind
him
by
accident
when
he
*NL*
went
away
;
until
Ham
,
running
after
him
to
restore
it
,
came
back
with
*NL*
the
information
that
it
was
intended
for
Peggotty
.
After
that
occasion
*NL*
he
appeared
every
evening
at
exactly
the
same
hour
,
and
always
with
a
*NL*
little
bundle
,
to
which
he
never
alluded
,
and
which
he
regularly
put
*NL*
behind
the
door
,
and
left
there
.
These
offerings
of
affection
were
of
a
*NL*
most
various
and
eccentric
description
.
Among
them
I
remember
a
double
*NL*
set
of
pig
's
trotters
,
a
huge
pin-cushion
,
half
a
bushel
or
so
of
*NL*
apples
,
a
pair
of
jet
earrings
,
some
Spanish
onions
,
a
box
of
dominoes
,
*NL*
a
canary
bird
and
cage
,
and
a
leg
of
pickled
pork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
's
wooing
,
as
I
remember
it
,
was
altogether
of
a
peculiar
*NL*
kind
.
He
very
seldom
said
anything
;
but
would
sit
by
the
fire
in
much
*NL*
the
same
attitude
as
he
sat
in
,
in
his
cart
,
and
stare
heavily
at
*NL*
Peggotty
,
who
was
opposite
.
One
night
,
being
,
as
I
suppose
,
inspired
by
*NL*
love
,
he
made
a
dart
at
the
bit
of
wax-candle
she
kept
for
her
thread
,
*NL*
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat-pocket
and
carried
it
off
.
After
that
,
his
*NL*
great
delight
was
to
produce
it
when
it
was
wanted
,
sticking
to
the
*NL*
lining
of
his
pocket
,
in
a
partially-melted
state
,
and
pocket
it
again
*NL*
when
it
was
done
with
.
He
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
very
much
,
and
not
to
*NL*
feel
at
all
called
upon
to
talk
.
Even
when
he
took
Peggotty
out
for
a
*NL*
walk
on
the
flats
,
he
had
no
uneasiness
on
that
head
,
I
believe
;
*NL*
contenting
himself
with
now
and
then
asking
her
if
she
was
pretty
*NL*
comfortable
;
and
I
remember
that
sometimes
,
after
he
was
gone
,
Peggotty
*NL*
would
throw
her
apron
over
her
face
,
and
laugh
for
half-an-hour
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
we
were
all
more
or
less
amused
,
except
that
miserable
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
*NL*
whose
courtship
would
appear
to
have
been
of
an
exactly
parallel
nature
,
*NL*
she
was
so
continually
reminded
by
these
transactions
of
the
old
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
when
the
term
of
my
visit
was
nearly
expired
,
it
was
given
*NL*
out
that
Peggotty
and
Mr.
Barkis
were
going
to
make
a
day
's
holiday
*NL*
together
,
and
that
little
Em
`
ly
and
I
were
to
accompany
them
.
I
had
but
*NL*
a
broken
sleep
the
night
before
,
in
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
of
a
*NL*
whole
day
with
Em
`
ly
.
We
were
all
astir
betimes
in
the
morning
;
and
*NL*
while
we
were
yet
at
breakfast
,
Mr.
Barkis
appeared
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
driving
a
chaise-cart
towards
the
object
of
his
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
was
drest
as
usual
,
in
her
neat
and
quiet
mourning
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Barkis
bloomed
in
a
new
blue
coat
,
of
which
the
tailor
had
given
him
*NL*
such
good
measure
,
that
the
cuffs
would
have
rendered
gloves
unnecessary
*NL*
in
the
coldest
weather
,
while
the
collar
was
so
high
that
it
pushed
his
*NL*
hair
up
on
end
on
the
top
of
his
head
.
His
bright
buttons
,
too
,
were
of
*NL*
the
largest
size
.
Rendered
complete
by
drab
pantaloons
and
a
buff
*NL*
waistcoat
,
I
thought
Mr.
Barkis
a
phenomenon
of
respectability
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
all
in
a
bustle
outside
the
door
,
I
found
that
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
was
prepared
with
an
old
shoe
,
which
was
to
be
thrown
after
us
for
luck
,
*NL*
and
which
he
offered
to
Mrs.
Gummidge
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
It
had
better
be
done
by
somebody
else
,
Dan
`
l
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
myself
,
and
everythink
that
reminds
me
of
*NL*
creetur
's
that
ai
n't
lone
and
lorn
,
goes
contrairy
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
old
gal
!
''
cried
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
Take
and
heave
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Dan
`
l
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
whimpering
and
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
``
If
I
felt
less
,
I
could
do
more
.
You
do
n't
feel
like
me
,
Dan
`
l
;
thinks
*NL*
do
n't
go
contrairy
with
you
,
nor
you
with
them
;
you
had
better
do
it
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
Peggotty
,
who
had
been
going
about
from
one
to
another
in
a
*NL*
hurried
way
,
kissing
everybody
,
called
out
from
the
cart
,
in
which
we
*NL*
all
were
by
this
time
-LRB-
Em
`
ly
and
I
on
two
little
chairs
,
side
by
side
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Gummidge
must
do
it
.
So
Mrs.
Gummidge
did
it
;
and
,
I
am
sorry
*NL*
to
relate
,
cast
a
damp
upon
the
festive
character
of
our
departure
,
by
*NL*
immediately
bursting
into
tears
,
and
sinking
subdued
into
the
arms
of
*NL*
Ham
,
with
the
declaration
that
she
knowed
she
was
a
burden
,
and
had
*NL*
better
be
carried
to
the
House
at
once
.
Which
I
really
thought
was
a
*NL*
sensible
idea
,
that
Ham
might
have
acted
on
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Away
we
went
,
however
,
on
our
holiday
excursion
;
and
the
first
thing
we
*NL*
did
was
to
stop
at
a
church
,
where
Mr.
Barkis
tied
the
horse
to
some
*NL*
rails
,
and
went
in
with
Peggotty
,
leaving
little
Em
`
ly
and
me
alone
in
*NL*
the
chaise
.
I
took
that
occasion
to
put
my
arm
round
Em
`
ly
's
waist
,
and
*NL*
propose
that
as
I
was
going
away
so
very
soon
now
,
we
should
determine
*NL*
to
be
very
affectionate
to
one
another
,
and
very
happy
,
all
day
.
Little
*NL*
Em
`
ly
consenting
,
and
allowing
me
to
kiss
her
,
I
became
desperate
;
*NL*
informing
her
,
I
recollect
,
that
I
never
could
love
another
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
prepared
to
shed
the
blood
of
anybody
who
should
aspire
to
her
*NL*
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
merry
little
Em
`
ly
made
herself
about
it
!
With
what
a
demure
*NL*
assumption
of
being
immensely
older
and
wiser
than
I
,
the
fairy
little
*NL*
woman
said
I
was
``
a
silly
boy
;
''
and
then
laughed
so
charmingly
that
I
*NL*
forgot
the
pain
of
being
called
by
that
disparaging
name
,
in
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
and
Peggotty
were
a
good
while
in
the
church
,
but
came
out
at
*NL*
last
,
and
then
we
drove
away
into
the
country
.
As
we
were
going
along
,
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
turned
to
me
,
and
said
,
with
a
wink
,
--
by-the-by
,
I
should
*NL*
hardly
have
thought
,
before
,
that
he
_
could
_
wink
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
was
it
as
I
wrote
up
in
the
cart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
Peggotty
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
would
it
be
as
I
should
write
up
now
,
if
there
was
a
tilt
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
Peggotty
,
again
?
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
Peggotty
BARKIS
!
''
he
returned
,
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
*NL*
that
shook
the
chaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
they
were
married
,
and
had
gone
into
the
church
for
no
other
*NL*
purpose
.
Peggotty
was
resolved
that
it
should
be
quietly
done
;
and
the
*NL*
clerk
had
given
her
away
,
and
there
had
been
no
witnesses
of
the
*NL*
ceremony
.
She
was
a
little
confused
when
Mr.
Barkis
made
this
abrupt
*NL*
announcement
of
their
union
,
and
could
not
hug
me
enough
in
token
of
her
*NL*
unimpaired
affection
;
but
she
soon
became
herself
again
,
and
said
she
*NL*
was
very
glad
it
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
drove
to
a
little
inn
in
a
bye
road
,
where
we
were
expected
,
and
*NL*
where
we
had
a
very
comfortable
dinner
,
and
passed
the
day
with
great
*NL*
satisfaction
.
If
Peggotty
had
been
married
every
day
for
the
last
ten
*NL*
years
,
she
could
hardly
have
been
more
at
her
ease
about
it
;
it
made
no
*NL*
sort
of
difference
in
her
:
she
was
just
the
same
as
ever
,
and
went
out
*NL*
for
a
stroll
with
little
Em
`
ly
and
me
before
tea
,
while
Mr.
Barkis
*NL*
philosophically
smoked
his
pipe
,
and
enjoyed
himself
,
I
suppose
,
with
*NL*
the
contemplation
of
his
happiness
.
If
so
,
it
sharpened
his
appetite
;
*NL*
for
I
distinctly
call
to
mind
that
,
although
he
had
eaten
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
pork
and
greens
at
dinner
,
and
had
finished
off
with
a
fowl
or
two
,
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
have
cold
boiled
bacon
for
tea
,
and
disposed
of
a
large
*NL*
quantity
without
any
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
thought
,
since
,
what
an
odd
,
innocent
,
out-of-the-way
kind
*NL*
of
wedding
it
must
have
been
!
We
got
into
the
chaise
again
soon
after
*NL*
dark
,
and
drove
cosily
back
,
looking
up
at
the
stars
,
and
talking
about
*NL*
them
.
I
was
their
chief
exponent
,
and
opened
Mr.
Barkis
's
mind
to
an
*NL*
amazing
extent
.
I
told
him
all
I
knew
,
but
he
would
have
believed
*NL*
anything
I
might
have
taken
it
into
my
head
to
impart
to
him
;
for
he
had
*NL*
a
profound
veneration
for
my
abilities
,
and
informed
his
wife
in
my
*NL*
hearing
,
on
that
very
occasion
,
that
I
was
``
a
young
Roeshus
''
--
by
which
I
*NL*
think
he
meant
,
prodigy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
exhausted
the
subject
of
the
stars
,
or
rather
when
I
had
*NL*
exhausted
the
mental
faculties
of
Mr.
Barkis
,
little
Em
`
ly
and
I
made
a
*NL*
cloak
of
an
old
wrapper
,
and
sat
under
it
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
*NL*
Ah
,
how
I
loved
her
!
What
happiness
-LRB-
I
thought
-RRB-
if
we
were
married
,
and
*NL*
were
going
away
anywhere
to
live
among
the
trees
and
in
the
fields
,
*NL*
never
growing
older
,
never
growing
wiser
,
children
ever
,
rambling
hand
*NL*
in
hand
through
sunshine
and
among
flowery
meadows
,
laying
down
our
*NL*
heads
on
moss
at
night
,
in
a
sweet
sleep
of
purity
and
peace
,
and
buried
*NL*
by
the
birds
when
we
were
dead
!
Some
such
picture
,
with
no
real
world
in
*NL*
it
,
bright
with
the
light
of
our
innocence
,
and
vague
as
the
stars
afar
*NL*
off
,
was
in
my
mind
all
the
way
.
I
am
glad
to
think
there
were
two
such
*NL*
guileless
hearts
at
Peggotty
's
marriage
as
little
Em
`
ly
's
and
mine
.
I
am
*NL*
glad
to
think
the
Loves
and
Graces
took
such
airy
forms
in
its
homely
*NL*
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
came
to
the
old
boat
again
in
good
time
at
night
;
and
there
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Barkis
bade
us
good-bye
,
and
drove
away
snugly
to
their
own
*NL*
home
.
I
felt
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
I
had
lost
Peggotty
.
I
*NL*
should
have
gone
to
bed
with
a
sore
heart
indeed
under
any
other
roof
*NL*
but
that
which
sheltered
little
Em
`
ly
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
and
Ham
knew
what
was
in
my
thoughts
as
well
as
I
did
,
and
*NL*
were
ready
with
some
supper
and
their
hospitable
faces
to
drive
it
away
.
*NL*
Little
Em
`
ly
came
and
sat
beside
me
on
the
locker
,
for
the
only
time
in
*NL*
all
that
visit
;
and
it
was
altogether
a
wonderful
close
to
a
wonderful
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
night
tide
;
and
soon
after
we
went
to
bed
,
Mr.
Peggotty
and
Ham
*NL*
went
out
to
fish
.
I
felt
very
brave
at
being
left
alone
in
the
solitary
*NL*
house
,
the
protector
of
Em
`
ly
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
and
only
wished
that
a
*NL*
lion
or
a
serpent
,
or
any
ill-disposed
monster
,
would
make
an
attack
*NL*
upon
us
,
that
I
might
destroy
him
,
and
cover
myself
with
glory
.
But
as
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
to
be
walking
about
on
Yarmouth
flats
that
*NL*
night
,
I
provided
the
best
substitute
I
could
by
dreaming
of
dragons
*NL*
until
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
morning
came
Peggotty
;
who
called
to
me
,
as
usual
,
under
my
window
*NL*
as
if
Mr.
Barkis
the
carrier
had
been
from
first
to
last
a
dream
too
.
*NL*
After
breakfast
she
took
me
to
her
own
home
,
and
a
beautiful
little
home
*NL*
it
was
.
Of
all
the
moveables
in
it
,
I
must
have
been
most
impressed
by
a
*NL*
certain
old
bureau
of
some
dark
wood
in
the
parlor
-LRB-
the
tile-floored
*NL*
kitchen
was
the
general
sitting-room
-RRB-
,
with
a
retreating
top
which
*NL*
opened
,
let
down
,
and
became
a
desk
,
within
which
,
was
a
large
quarto
*NL*
edition
of
Fox
's
Book
of
Martyrs
.
This
precious
volume
,
of
which
I
do
*NL*
not
recollect
one
word
,
I
immediately
discovered
and
immediately
applied
*NL*
myself
to
;
and
I
never
visited
the
house
afterwards
,
but
I
kneeled
on
a
*NL*
chair
,
opened
the
casket
where
this
gem
was
enshrined
,
spread
my
arms
*NL*
over
the
desk
,
and
fell
to
devouring
the
book
afresh
.
I
was
chiefly
*NL*
edified
,
I
am
afraid
,
by
the
pictures
,
which
were
numerous
,
and
*NL*
represented
all
kinds
of
dismal
horrors
;
but
the
Martyrs
and
Peggotty
's
*NL*
house
have
been
inseparable
in
my
mind
ever
since
,
and
are
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
leave
of
Mr.
Peggotty
,
and
Ham
,
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
and
little
*NL*
Em
`
ly
,
that
day
;
and
passed
the
night
at
Peggotty
's
,
in
a
little
room
in
*NL*
the
roof
-LRB-
with
the
crocodile-book
on
a
shelf
by
the
bed
's
head
-RRB-
which
*NL*
was
to
be
always
mine
,
Peggotty
said
,
and
should
always
be
kept
for
me
*NL*
in
exactly
the
same
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
or
old
,
Davy
dear
,
as
long
as
I
am
alive
and
have
this
house
over
*NL*
my
head
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
you
shall
find
it
as
if
I
expected
you
here
*NL*
directly
minute
.
I
shall
keep
it
every
day
,
as
I
used
to
keep
your
old
*NL*
little
room
,
my
darling
;
and
if
you
was
to
go
to
China
,
you
might
think
*NL*
of
it
as
being
kept
just
the
same
,
all
the
time
you
were
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
truth
and
constancy
of
my
dear
old
nurse
,
with
all
my
heart
,
*NL*
and
thanked
her
as
well
as
I
could
.
That
was
not
very
well
,
for
she
*NL*
spoke
to
me
thus
,
with
her
arms
round
my
neck
,
in
the
morning
,
and
I
was
*NL*
going
home
in
the
morning
,
and
I
went
home
in
the
morning
,
with
herself
*NL*
and
Mr.
Barkis
in
the
cart
.
They
left
me
at
the
gate
,
not
easily
or
*NL*
lightly
;
and
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
me
to
see
the
cart
go
on
,
taking
*NL*
Peggotty
away
,
and
leaving
me
under
the
old
elm-trees
looking
at
the
*NL*
house
,
in
which
there
was
no
face
to
look
on
mine
with
love
or
liking
*NL*
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
fell
into
a
state
of
neglect
,
which
I
can
not
look
back
upon
*NL*
without
compassion
.
I
fell
at
once
into
a
solitary
condition
,
--
apart
*NL*
from
all
friendly
notice
,
apart
from
the
society
of
all
other
boys
*NL*
of
my
own
age
,
apart
from
all
companionship
but
my
own
spiritless
*NL*
thoughts
,
--
which
seems
to
cast
its
gloom
upon
this
paper
as
I
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
I
have
given
,
to
have
been
sent
to
the
hardest
school
that
*NL*
ever
was
kept
!
--
to
have
been
taught
something
,
anyhow
,
anywhere
!
No
such
*NL*
hope
dawned
upon
me
.
They
disliked
me
;
and
they
sullenly
,
sternly
,
*NL*
steadily
,
overlooked
me
.
I
think
Mr.
Murdstone
's
means
were
straitened
*NL*
at
about
this
time
;
but
it
is
little
to
the
purpose
.
He
could
not
bear
*NL*
me
;
and
in
putting
me
from
him
he
tried
,
as
I
believe
,
to
put
away
the
*NL*
notion
that
I
had
any
claim
upon
him
--
and
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
actively
ill-used
.
I
was
not
beaten
,
or
starved
;
but
the
wrong
*NL*
that
was
done
to
me
had
no
intervals
of
relenting
,
and
was
done
in
a
*NL*
systematic
,
passionless
manner
.
Day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
month
*NL*
after
month
,
I
was
coldly
neglected
.
I
wonder
sometimes
,
when
I
think
of
*NL*
it
,
what
they
would
have
done
if
I
had
been
taken
with
an
illness
;
*NL*
whether
I
should
have
lain
down
in
my
lonely
room
,
and
languished
*NL*
through
it
in
my
usual
solitary
way
,
or
whether
anybody
would
have
*NL*
helped
me
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
at
home
,
I
took
my
meals
with
them
;
in
*NL*
their
absence
,
I
ate
and
drank
by
myself
.
At
all
times
I
lounged
about
*NL*
the
house
and
neighbourhood
quite
disregarded
,
except
that
they
were
*NL*
jealous
of
my
making
any
friends
:
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
,
if
I
did
,
I
*NL*
might
complain
to
some
one
.
For
this
reason
,
though
Mr.
Chillip
often
*NL*
asked
me
to
go
and
see
him
-LRB-
he
was
a
widower
,
having
,
some
years
before
*NL*
that
,
lost
a
little
small
light-haired
wife
,
whom
I
can
just
remember
*NL*
connecting
in
my
own
thoughts
with
a
pale
tortoise-shell
cat
-RRB-
,
it
was
*NL*
but
seldom
that
I
enjoyed
the
happiness
of
passing
an
afternoon
in
his
*NL*
closet
of
a
surgery
;
reading
some
book
that
was
new
to
me
,
with
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
whole
pharmacopoeia
coming
up
my
nose
,
or
pounding
something
*NL*
in
a
mortar
under
his
mild
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
same
reason
,
added
no
doubt
to
the
old
dislike
of
her
,
I
was
*NL*
seldom
allowed
to
visit
Peggotty
.
Faithful
to
her
promise
,
she
either
*NL*
came
to
see
me
,
or
met
me
somewhere
near
,
once
every
week
,
and
never
*NL*
empty-handed
;
but
many
and
bitter
were
the
disappointments
I
had
,
in
*NL*
being
refused
permission
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
at
her
house
.
Some
few
*NL*
times
,
however
,
at
long
intervals
,
I
was
allowed
to
go
there
;
and
then
I
*NL*
found
out
that
Mr.
Barkis
was
something
of
a
miser
,
or
as
Peggotty
*NL*
dutifully
expressed
it
,
was
``
a
little
near
,
''
and
kept
a
heap
of
money
in
*NL*
a
box
under
his
bed
,
which
he
pretended
was
only
full
of
coats
and
*NL*
trousers
.
In
this
coffer
,
his
riches
hid
themselves
with
such
a
*NL*
tenacious
modesty
,
that
the
smallest
instalments
could
only
be
tempted
*NL*
out
by
artifice
;
so
that
Peggotty
had
to
prepare
a
long
and
elaborate
*NL*
scheme
,
a
very
Gunpowder
Plot
,
for
every
Saturday
's
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
I
was
so
conscious
of
the
waste
of
any
promise
I
had
*NL*
given
,
and
of
my
being
utterly
neglected
,
that
I
should
have
been
*NL*
perfectly
miserable
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
but
for
the
old
books
.
They
were
*NL*
my
only
comfort
;
and
I
was
as
true
to
them
as
they
were
to
me
,
and
read
*NL*
them
over
and
over
I
do
n't
know
how
many
times
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
approach
a
period
of
my
life
,
which
I
can
never
lose
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
,
while
I
remember
any
thing
;
and
the
recollection
of
*NL*
which
has
often
,
without
my
invocation
,
come
before
me
like
a
ghost
,
and
*NL*
haunted
happier
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
out
,
one
day
,
loitering
somewhere
,
in
the
listless
,
*NL*
meditative
manner
that
my
way
of
life
engendered
,
when
,
turning
the
*NL*
corner
of
a
lane
near
our
house
,
I
came
upon
Mr.
Murdstone
walking
with
*NL*
a
gentleman
.
I
was
confused
,
and
was
going
by
them
,
when
the
gentleman
*NL*
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Brooks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
David
Copperfield
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
me
.
You
are
Brooks
,
''
said
the
gentleman
.
``
You
are
Brooks
of
*NL*
Sheffield
.
That
's
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
I
observed
the
gentleman
more
attentively
.
His
laugh
*NL*
coming
to
my
remembrance
too
,
I
knew
him
to
be
Mr.
Quinion
,
whom
I
had
*NL*
gone
over
to
Lowestoft
with
Mr.
Murdstone
to
see
,
before
--
it
is
no
*NL*
matter
--
I
need
not
recall
when
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
get
on
,
and
where
are
you
being
educated
,
Brooks
?
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Quinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
turned
me
about
,
to
walk
with
*NL*
them
.
I
did
not
know
what
to
reply
,
and
glanced
dubiously
at
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
at
home
at
present
,
''
said
the
latter
.
``
He
is
not
being
educated
*NL*
anywhere
.
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
him
.
He
is
a
difficult
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
old
,
double
look
was
on
me
for
a
moment
;
and
then
his
eye
darkened
*NL*
with
a
frown
,
as
it
turned
,
in
its
aversion
,
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!
''
said
Mr.
Quinion
,
looking
at
us
both
,
I
thought
.
``
Fine
*NL*
weather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
ensued
,
and
I
was
considering
how
I
could
best
disengage
my
*NL*
shoulder
from
his
hand
,
and
go
away
,
when
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
are
a
pretty
sharp
fellow
still
?
Eh
,
Brooks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
He
is
sharp
enough
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
impatiently
.
``
You
had
*NL*
better
let
him
go
.
He
will
not
thank
you
for
troubling
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
hint
,
Mr.
Quinion
released
me
,
and
I
made
the
best
of
my
way
*NL*
home
.
Looking
back
as
I
turned
into
the
front
garden
,
I
saw
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
leaning
against
the
wicket
of
the
churchyard
,
and
Mr.
Quinion
*NL*
talking
to
him
.
They
were
both
looking
after
me
,
and
I
felt
that
they
*NL*
were
speaking
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Quinion
lay
at
our
house
that
night
.
After
breakfast
,
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
I
had
put
my
chair
away
,
and
was
going
out
of
the
room
,
when
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
called
me
back
.
He
then
gravely
repaired
to
another
table
,
*NL*
where
his
sister
sat
herself
at
her
desk
.
Mr.
Quinion
,
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
,
stood
looking
out
of
window
;
and
I
stood
looking
at
them
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
``
to
the
young
this
is
a
world
for
action
;
*NL*
not
for
moping
and
droning
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
As
you
do
,
''
added
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
Murdstone
,
leave
it
to
me
,
if
you
please
.
I
say
,
David
,
to
the
*NL*
young
this
is
a
world
for
action
,
and
not
for
moping
and
droning
in
.
It
*NL*
is
especially
so
for
a
young
boy
of
your
disposition
,
which
requires
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
correcting
;
and
to
which
no
greater
service
can
be
done
*NL*
than
to
force
it
to
conform
to
the
ways
of
the
working
world
,
and
to
*NL*
bend
it
and
break
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
stubbornness
wo
n't
do
here
,
''
said
his
sister
.
``
What
it
wants
,
is
,
*NL*
to
be
crushed
.
And
crushed
it
must
be
.
Shall
be
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
a
look
,
half
in
remonstrance
,
half
in
approval
,
and
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
know
,
David
,
that
I
am
not
rich
.
At
any
rate
,
you
know
it
*NL*
now
.
You
have
received
some
considerable
education
already
.
Education
is
*NL*
costly
;
and
even
if
it
were
not
,
and
I
could
afford
it
,
I
am
of
opinion
*NL*
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
advantageous
to
you
to
be
kept
at
a
school
.
*NL*
What
is
before
you
,
is
a
fight
with
the
world
;
and
the
sooner
you
begin
*NL*
it
,
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
had
already
begun
it
,
in
my
poor
way
:
*NL*
but
it
occurs
to
me
now
,
whether
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
`
the
counting-house
'
mentioned
sometimes
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
counting-house
,
sir
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
,
in
the
wine
trade
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
I
looked
uncertain
,
for
he
went
on
hastily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
the
`
counting-house
'
mentioned
,
or
the
business
,
or
the
*NL*
cellars
,
or
the
wharf
,
or
something
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
heard
the
business
mentioned
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
remembering
*NL*
what
I
vaguely
knew
of
his
and
his
sister
's
resources
.
``
But
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
when
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
not
matter
when
,
''
he
returned
.
``
Mr.
Quinion
manages
that
*NL*
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
at
the
latter
deferentially
as
he
stood
looking
out
of
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Quinion
suggests
that
it
gives
employment
to
some
other
boys
,
and
*NL*
that
he
sees
no
reason
why
it
should
n't
,
on
the
same
terms
,
give
*NL*
employment
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
having
,
''
Mr.
Quinion
observed
in
a
low
voice
,
and
half
turning
*NL*
round
,
``
no
other
prospect
,
Murdstone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
,
with
an
impatient
,
even
an
angry
gesture
,
resumed
,
*NL*
without
noticing
what
he
had
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
terms
are
,
that
you
will
earn
enough
for
yourself
to
provide
for
*NL*
your
eating
and
drinking
,
and
pocket-money
.
Your
lodging
-LRB-
which
I
have
*NL*
arranged
for
-RRB-
will
be
paid
by
me
.
So
will
your
washing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Which
will
be
kept
down
to
my
estimate
,
''
said
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
clothes
will
be
looked
after
for
you
,
too
,
''
said
Mr.
Murdstone
;
*NL*
``
as
you
will
not
be
able
,
yet
awhile
,
to
get
them
for
yourself
.
So
you
*NL*
are
now
going
to
London
,
David
,
with
Mr.
Quinion
,
to
begin
the
world
on
*NL*
your
own
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
you
are
provided
for
,
''
observed
his
sister
;
``
and
will
please
*NL*
to
do
your
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
quite
understood
that
the
purpose
of
this
announcement
was
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
me
,
I
have
no
distinct
remembrance
whether
it
pleased
or
*NL*
frightened
me
.
My
impression
is
,
that
I
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
*NL*
about
it
,
and
,
oscillating
between
the
two
points
,
touched
neither
.
Nor
*NL*
had
I
much
time
for
the
clearing
of
my
thoughts
,
as
Mr.
Quinion
was
to
*NL*
go
upon
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behold
me
,
on
the
morrow
,
in
a
much-worn
little
white
hat
,
with
a
black
*NL*
crape
round
it
for
my
mother
,
a
black
jacket
,
and
a
pair
of
hard
stiff
*NL*
corduroy
trousers
--
which
Miss
Murdstone
considered
the
best
armour
for
*NL*
the
legs
in
that
fight
with
the
world
which
was
now
to
come
off
:
behold
*NL*
me
so
attired
,
and
with
my
little
worldly
all
before
me
in
a
small
*NL*
trunk
,
sitting
,
a
lone
lorn
child
-LRB-
as
Mrs.
Gummidge
might
have
said
-RRB-
,
in
*NL*
the
postchaise
that
was
carrying
Mr.
Quinion
to
the
London
coach
at
*NL*
Yarmouth
!
See
,
how
our
house
and
church
are
lessening
in
the
distance
;
*NL*
how
the
grave
beneath
the
tree
is
blotted
out
by
intervening
objects
;
*NL*
how
the
spire

CHAPTER
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
BEGIN
LIFE
ON
MY
OWN
ACCOUNT
,
AND
DO
N'T
LIKE
IT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
enough
of
the
world
now
,
to
have
almost
lost
the
capacity
of
*NL*
being
much
surprised
by
anything
;
but
it
is
matter
of
some
surprise
to
*NL*
me
,
even
now
,
that
I
can
have
been
so
easily
thrown
away
at
such
an
age
.
*NL*
A
child
of
excellent
abilities
,
and
with
strong
powers
of
observation
,
*NL*
quick
,
eager
,
delicate
,
and
soon
hurt
bodily
or
mentally
,
it
seems
*NL*
wonderful
to
me
that
nobody
should
have
made
any
sign
in
my
behalf
.
But
*NL*
none
was
made
;
and
I
became
,
at
ten
years
old
,
a
little
labouring
hind
*NL*
in
the
service
of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
warehouse
was
at
the
water
side
.
It
was
down
in
*NL*
Blackfriars
.
Modern
improvements
have
altered
the
place
;
but
it
was
the
*NL*
last
house
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
street
,
curving
down
hill
to
the
*NL*
river
,
with
some
stairs
at
the
end
,
where
people
took
boat
.
It
was
a
*NL*
crazy
old
house
with
a
wharf
of
its
own
,
abutting
on
the
water
when
the
*NL*
tide
was
in
,
and
on
the
mud
when
the
tide
was
out
,
and
literally
overrun
*NL*
with
rats
.
Its
panelled
rooms
,
discolored
with
the
dirt
and
smoke
of
a
*NL*
hundred
years
,
I
dare
say
;
its
decaying
floors
and
staircase
;
the
*NL*
squeaking
and
scuffling
of
the
old
grey
rats
down
in
the
cellars
;
and
*NL*
the
dirt
and
rottenness
of
the
place
;
are
things
,
not
of
many
years
ago
,
*NL*
in
my
mind
,
but
of
the
present
instant
.
They
are
all
before
me
,
just
as
*NL*
they
were
in
the
evil
hour
when
I
went
among
them
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
with
my
trembling
hand
in
Mr.
Quinion
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
trade
was
among
a
good
many
kinds
of
people
,
but
*NL*
an
important
branch
of
it
was
the
supply
of
wines
and
spirits
to
certain
*NL*
packet
ships
.
I
forget
now
where
they
chiefly
went
,
but
I
think
there
*NL*
were
some
among
them
that
made
voyages
both
to
the
East
and
West
Indies
.
*NL*
I
know
that
a
great
many
empty
bottles
were
one
of
the
consequences
of
*NL*
this
traffic
,
and
that
certain
men
and
boys
were
employed
to
examine
*NL*
them
against
the
light
,
and
reject
those
that
were
flawed
,
and
to
rinse
*NL*
and
wash
them
.
When
the
empty
bottles
ran
short
,
there
were
labels
to
be
*NL*
pasted
on
full
ones
,
or
corks
to
be
fitted
to
them
,
or
seals
to
be
put
*NL*
upon
the
corks
,
or
finished
bottles
to
be
packed
in
casks
.
All
this
work
*NL*
was
my
work
,
and
of
the
boys
employed
upon
it
I
was
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
or
four
of
us
,
counting
me
.
My
working
place
was
*NL*
established
in
a
corner
of
the
warehouse
,
where
Mr.
Quinion
could
see
*NL*
me
,
when
he
chose
to
stand
up
on
the
bottom
rail
of
his
stool
in
the
*NL*
counting-house
,
and
look
at
me
through
a
window
above
the
desk
.
Hither
,
*NL*
on
the
first
morning
of
my
so
auspiciously
beginning
life
on
my
own
*NL*
account
,
the
oldest
of
the
regular
boys
was
summoned
to
show
me
my
*NL*
business
.
His
name
was
Mick
Walker
,
and
he
wore
a
ragged
apron
and
a
*NL*
paper
cap
.
He
informed
me
that
his
father
was
a
bargeman
,
and
walked
,
in
*NL*
a
black
velvet
head-dress
,
in
the
Lord
Mayor
's
Show
.
He
also
informed
me
*NL*
that
our
principal
associate
would
be
another
boy
whom
he
introduced
by
*NL*
the
--
to
me
--
extraordinary
name
of
Mealy
Potatoes
.
I
discovered
,
however
,
*NL*
that
this
youth
had
not
been
christened
by
that
name
,
but
that
it
had
*NL*
been
bestowed
upon
him
in
the
warehouse
,
on
account
of
his
complexion
,
*NL*
which
was
pale
or
mealy
.
Mealy
's
father
was
a
waterman
,
who
had
the
*NL*
additional
distinction
of
being
a
fireman
,
and
was
engaged
as
such
at
*NL*
one
of
the
large
theatres
;
where
some
young
relation
of
Mealy
's
--
I
think
*NL*
his
little
sister
--
did
Imps
in
the
Pantomimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
words
can
express
the
secret
agony
of
my
soul
as
I
sunk
into
this
*NL*
companionship
;
compared
these
henceforth
every-day
associates
with
those
*NL*
of
my
happier
childhood
--
not
to
say
with
Steerforth
,
Traddles
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
of
those
boys
;
and
felt
my
hopes
of
growing
up
to
be
a
learned
and
*NL*
distinguished
man
,
crushed
in
my
bosom
.
The
deep
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
sense
I
had
,
of
being
utterly
without
hope
now
;
of
the
shame
I
felt
in
*NL*
my
position
;
of
the
misery
it
was
to
my
young
heart
to
believe
that
day
*NL*
by
day
what
I
had
learned
,
and
thought
,
and
delighted
in
,
and
raised
my
*NL*
fancy
and
my
emulation
up
by
,
would
pass
away
from
me
,
little
by
little
,
*NL*
never
to
be
brought
back
any
more
;
can
not
be
written
.
As
often
as
Mick
*NL*
Walker
went
away
in
the
course
of
that
forenoon
,
I
mingled
my
tears
with
*NL*
the
water
in
which
I
was
washing
the
bottles
;
and
sobbed
as
if
there
*NL*
were
a
flaw
in
my
own
breast
,
and
it
were
in
danger
of
bursting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
counting-house
clock
was
at
half-past
twelve
,
and
there
was
general
*NL*
preparation
for
going
to
dinner
,
when
Mr.
Quinion
tapped
at
the
*NL*
counting-house
window
,
and
beckoned
to
me
to
go
in
.
I
went
in
,
and
found
*NL*
there
a
stoutish
,
middle-aged
person
,
in
a
brown
surtout
and
black
*NL*
tights
and
shoes
,
with
no
more
hair
upon
his
head
-LRB-
which
was
a
large
*NL*
one
,
and
very
shining
-RRB-
than
there
is
upon
an
egg
,
and
with
a
very
*NL*
extensive
face
,
which
he
turned
full
upon
me
.
His
clothes
were
shabby
,
*NL*
but
he
had
an
imposing
shirt-collar
on
.
He
carried
a
jaunty
sort
of
a
*NL*
stick
,
with
a
large
pair
of
rusty
tassels
to
it
;
and
a
quizzing-glass
*NL*
hung
outside
his
coat
,
--
for
ornament
,
I
afterwards
found
,
as
he
very
*NL*
seldom
looked
through
it
,
and
could
n't
see
anything
when
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
Mr.
Quinion
,
in
allusion
to
myself
,
``
is
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
certain
condescending
roll
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
and
a
certain
indescribable
air
of
doing
something
genteel
,
which
*NL*
impressed
me
very
much
,
``
is
Master
Copperfield
.
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
*NL*
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
was
very
well
,
and
hoped
he
was
.
I
was
sufficiently
ill
at
*NL*
ease
,
Heaven
knows
;
but
it
was
not
in
my
nature
to
complain
much
at
that
*NL*
time
of
my
life
,
so
I
said
I
was
very
well
,
and
hoped
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
thank
Heaven
,
quite
well
.
I
have
received
*NL*
a
letter
from
Mr.
Murdstone
,
in
which
he
mentions
that
he
would
desire
*NL*
me
to
receive
into
an
apartment
in
the
rear
of
my
house
,
which
is
*NL*
at
present
unoccupied
--
and
is
,
in
short
,
to
be
let
as
a
--
in
short
,
''
*NL*
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
smile
and
in
a
burst
of
confidence
,
``
as
a
*NL*
bed-room
--
the
young
beginner
whom
I
have
now
the
pleasure
to
--
''
and
the
*NL*
stranger
waved
his
hand
,
and
settled
his
chin
in
his
shirt
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
Mr.
Quinion
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ahem
!
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
that
is
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
Mr.
Quinion
,
``
is
known
to
Mr.
Murdstone
.
He
takes
*NL*
orders
for
us
on
commission
,
when
he
can
get
any
.
He
has
been
written
to
*NL*
by
Mr.
Murdstone
,
on
the
subject
of
your
lodgings
,
and
he
will
receive
*NL*
you
as
a
lodger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
address
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
is
Windsor
Terrace
,
City
Road
.
I
--
in
*NL*
short
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
the
same
genteel
air
,
and
in
another
*NL*
burst
of
confidence
--
``
I
live
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
him
a
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
impression
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
that
your
peregrinations
in
*NL*
this
metropolis
have
not
as
yet
been
extensive
,
and
that
you
might
have
*NL*
some
difficulty
in
penetrating
the
arcana
of
the
Modern
Babylon
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
City
Road
--
in
short
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
in
another
*NL*
burst
of
confidence
,
``
that
you
might
lose
yourself
--
I
shall
be
happy
to
*NL*
call
this
evening
,
and
install
you
in
the
knowledge
of
the
nearest
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
with
all
my
heart
,
for
it
was
friendly
in
him
to
offer
to
*NL*
take
that
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
hour
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
shall
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
about
eight
,
''
said
Mr.
Quinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
about
eight
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
.
``
I
beg
to
wish
you
good
day
,
Mr.
*NL*
Quinion
.
I
will
intrude
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
put
on
his
hat
,
and
went
out
with
his
cane
under
his
arm
:
very
*NL*
upright
,
and
humming
a
tune
when
he
was
clear
of
the
counting-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Quinion
then
formally
engaged
me
to
be
as
useful
as
I
could
in
the
*NL*
warehouse
of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
,
at
a
salary
,
I
think
,
of
six
*NL*
shillings
a
week
.
I
am
not
clear
whether
it
was
six
or
seven
.
I
am
*NL*
inclined
to
believe
,
from
my
uncertainty
on
this
head
,
that
it
was
six
*NL*
at
first
and
seven
afterwards
.
He
paid
me
a
week
down
-LRB-
from
his
own
*NL*
pocket
,
I
believe
-RRB-
,
and
I
gave
Mealy
sixpence
out
of
it
to
get
my
trunk
*NL*
carried
to
Windsor
Terrace
at
night
:
it
being
too
heavy
for
my
strength
,
*NL*
small
as
it
was
.
I
paid
sixpence
more
for
my
dinner
,
which
was
a
meat
*NL*
pie
and
a
turn
at
a
neighbouring
pump
;
and
passed
the
hour
which
was
*NL*
allowed
for
that
meal
,
in
walking
about
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
time
in
the
evening
,
Mr.
Micawber
reappeared
.
I
washed
*NL*
my
hands
and
face
,
to
do
the
greater
honour
to
his
gentility
,
and
we
*NL*
walked
to
our
house
,
as
I
suppose
I
must
now
call
it
,
together
;
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
impressing
the
names
of
streets
,
and
the
shapes
of
corner
*NL*
houses
upon
me
,
as
we
went
along
,
that
I
might
find
my
way
back
,
easily
,
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
his
house
in
Windsor
Terrace
-LRB-
which
I
noticed
was
shabby
like
*NL*
himself
,
but
also
,
like
himself
,
made
all
the
show
it
could
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
presented
me
to
Mrs.
Micawber
,
a
thin
and
faded
lady
,
not
at
all
young
,
*NL*
who
was
sitting
in
the
parlor
-LRB-
the
first
floor
was
altogether
*NL*
unfurnished
,
and
the
blinds
were
kept
down
to
delude
the
neighbours
-RRB-
,
*NL*
with
a
baby
at
her
breast
.
This
baby
was
one
of
twins
;
and
I
may
remark
*NL*
here
that
I
hardly
ever
,
in
all
my
experience
of
the
family
,
saw
both
*NL*
the
twins
detached
from
Mrs.
Micawber
at
the
same
time
.
One
of
them
was
*NL*
always
taking
refreshment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
other
children
;
Master
Micawber
,
aged
about
four
,
and
*NL*
Miss
Micawber
,
aged
about
three
.
These
,
and
a
dark-complexioned
young
*NL*
woman
,
with
a
habit
of
snorting
,
who
was
servant
to
the
family
,
and
*NL*
informed
me
,
before
half-an-hour
had
expired
,
that
she
was
``
a
Orfling
,
''
*NL*
and
came
from
St.
Luke
's
workhouse
,
in
the
neighbourhood
,
completed
the
*NL*
establishment
.
My
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
at
the
back
:
a
close
*NL*
chamber
;
stencilled
all
over
with
an
ornament
which
my
young
imagination
*NL*
represented
as
a
blue
muffin
;
and
very
scantily
furnished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
when
she
came
up
,
twin
and
all
,
*NL*
to
show
me
the
apartment
,
and
sat
down
to
take
breath
,
``
before
I
was
*NL*
married
,
when
I
lived
with
papa
and
mama
,
that
I
should
ever
find
it
*NL*
necessary
to
take
a
lodger
.
But
Mr.
Micawber
being
in
difficulties
,
all
*NL*
considerations
of
private
feeling
must
give
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
:
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Micawber
's
difficulties
are
almost
overwhelming
just
at
present
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Micawber
;
``
and
whether
it
is
possible
to
bring
him
through
*NL*
them
,
I
do
n't
know
.
When
I
lived
at
home
with
papa
and
mama
,
I
really
*NL*
should
have
hardly
understood
what
the
word
meant
,
in
the
sense
in
which
*NL*
I
now
employ
it
,
but
experientia
does
it
--
as
papa
used
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
satisfy
myself
whether
she
told
me
that
Mr.
Micawber
had
been
*NL*
an
officer
in
the
Marines
,
or
whether
I
have
imagined
it
.
I
only
know
*NL*
that
I
believe
to
this
hour
that
he
_
was
_
in
the
Marines
once
upon
a
*NL*
time
,
without
knowing
why
.
He
was
a
sort
of
town
traveller
for
a
number
*NL*
of
miscellaneous
houses
,
now
;
but
made
little
or
nothing
of
it
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mr.
Micawber
's
creditors
_
will
not
_
give
him
time
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
``
they
must
take
the
consequences
;
and
the
sooner
they
bring
it
*NL*
to
an
issue
the
better
.
Blood
can
not
be
obtained
from
a
stone
,
neither
*NL*
can
anything
on
account
be
obtained
at
present
-LRB-
not
to
mention
law
*NL*
expenses
-RRB-
from
Mr.
Micawber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
can
quite
understand
whether
my
precocious
self-dependence
*NL*
confused
Mrs.
Micawber
in
reference
to
my
age
,
or
whether
she
was
so
*NL*
full
of
the
subject
that
she
would
have
talked
about
it
to
the
very
*NL*
twins
if
there
had
been
nobody
else
to
communicate
with
,
but
this
was
*NL*
the
strain
in
which
she
began
,
and
she
went
on
accordingly
all
the
time
*NL*
I
knew
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Micawber
!
She
said
she
had
tried
to
exert
herself
;
and
so
,
I
*NL*
have
no
doubt
,
she
had
.
The
centre
of
the
street-door
was
perfectly
*NL*
covered
with
a
great
brass-plate
,
on
which
was
engraved
``
Mrs.
Micawber
's
*NL*
Boarding
Establishment
for
Young
Ladies
:
''
but
I
never
found
that
any
*NL*
young
lady
had
ever
been
to
school
there
;
or
that
any
young
lady
ever
*NL*
came
,
or
proposed
to
come
;
or
that
the
least
preparation
was
ever
made
*NL*
to
receive
any
young
lady
.
The
only
visitors
I
ever
saw
or
heard
of
,
*NL*
were
creditors
.
_
They
_
used
to
come
at
all
hours
,
and
some
of
them
were
*NL*
quite
ferocious
.
One
dirty-faced
man
,
I
think
he
was
a
bootmaker
,
used
*NL*
to
edge
himself
into
the
passage
as
early
as
seven
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
call
up
the
stairs
to
Mr.
Micawber
--
``
Come
!
You
ai
n't
out
*NL*
yet
,
you
know
.
Pay
us
,
will
you
?
Do
n't
hide
,
you
know
;
that
's
mean
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
be
mean
if
I
was
you
.
Pay
us
,
will
you
?
You
just
pay
us
,
d'ye
*NL*
hear
?
Come
!
''
Receiving
no
answer
to
these
taunts
,
he
would
mount
in
his
*NL*
wrath
to
the
words
``
swindlers
''
and
``
robbers
;
''
and
these
being
*NL*
ineffectual
too
,
would
sometimes
go
to
the
extremity
of
crossing
the
*NL*
street
,
and
roaring
up
at
the
windows
of
the
second
floor
,
where
he
knew
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
.
At
these
times
,
Mr.
Micawber
would
be
transported
with
*NL*
grief
and
mortification
,
even
to
the
length
-LRB-
as
I
was
once
made
aware
by
*NL*
a
scream
from
his
wife
-RRB-
of
making
motions
at
himself
with
a
razor
;
but
*NL*
within
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
he
would
polish
up
his
shoes
with
*NL*
extraordinary
pains
,
and
go
out
,
humming
a
tune
with
a
greater
air
of
*NL*
gentility
than
ever
.
Mrs.
Micawber
was
quite
as
elastic
.
I
have
known
*NL*
her
to
be
thrown
into
fainting
fits
by
the
king
's
taxes
at
three
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
to
eat
lamb-chops
,
breaded
,
and
drink
warm
ale
-LRB-
paid
for
*NL*
with
two
tea-spoons
that
had
gone
to
the
pawnbroker
's
-RRB-
at
four
.
On
one
*NL*
occasion
,
when
an
execution
had
just
been
put
in
,
coming
home
through
*NL*
some
chance
as
early
as
six
o'clock
,
I
saw
her
lying
-LRB-
of
course
with
a
*NL*
twin
-RRB-
under
the
grate
in
a
swoon
,
with
her
hair
all
torn
about
her
face
;
*NL*
but
I
never
knew
her
more
cheerful
than
she
was
,
that
very
same
night
,
*NL*
over
a
veal-cutlet
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
telling
me
stories
about
her
*NL*
papa
and
mama
,
and
the
company
they
used
to
keep
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
house
,
and
with
this
family
,
I
passed
my
leisure
time
.
My
own
*NL*
exclusive
breakfast
of
a
penny
loaf
and
a
pennyworth
of
milk
,
I
provided
*NL*
myself
.
I
kept
another
small
loaf
,
and
a
modicum
of
cheese
,
on
a
*NL*
particular
shelf
of
a
particular
cupboard
,
to
make
my
supper
on
when
I
*NL*
came
back
at
night
.
This
made
a
hole
in
the
six
or
seven
shillings
,
I
*NL*
know
well
;
and
I
was
out
at
the
warehouse
all
day
,
and
had
to
support
*NL*
myself
on
that
money
all
the
week
.
From
Monday
morning
until
Saturday
*NL*
night
,
I
had
no
advice
,
no
counsel
,
no
encouragement
,
no
consolation
,
no
*NL*
assistance
,
no
support
,
of
any
kind
,
from
any
one
,
that
I
can
call
to
*NL*
mind
,
as
I
hope
to
go
to
heaven
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
young
and
childish
,
and
so
little
qualified
--
how
could
I
be
*NL*
otherwise
?
--
to
undertake
the
whole
charge
of
my
own
existence
,
that
*NL*
often
,
in
going
to
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
of
a
morning
,
I
could
*NL*
not
resist
the
stale
pastry
put
out
for
sale
at
half-price
at
the
*NL*
pastrycook
's
doors
,
and
spent
in
that
,
the
money
I
should
have
kept
*NL*
for
my
dinner
.
Then
,
I
went
without
my
dinner
,
or
bought
a
roll
or
a
*NL*
slice
of
pudding
.
I
remember
two
pudding-shops
,
between
which
I
was
*NL*
divided
,
according
to
my
finances
.
One
was
in
a
court
close
to
St.
*NL*
Martin
's
Church
--
at
the
back
of
the
church
,
--
which
is
now
removed
*NL*
altogether
.
The
pudding
at
that
shop
was
made
of
currants
,
and
was
*NL*
rather
a
special
pudding
,
but
was
dear
,
twopennyworth
not
being
larger
*NL*
than
a
pennyworth
of
more
ordinary
pudding
.
A
good
shop
for
the
latter
*NL*
was
in
the
Strand
--
somewhere
in
that
part
which
has
been
rebuilt
since
.
*NL*
It
was
a
stout
pale
pudding
,
heavy
and
flabby
,
and
with
great
flat
*NL*
raisins
in
it
,
stuck
in
whole
at
wide
distances
apart
.
It
came
up
hot
*NL*
at
about
my
time
every
day
,
and
many
a
day
did
I
dine
off
it
.
When
I
*NL*
dined
regularly
and
handsomely
,
I
had
a
saveloy
and
a
penny-loaf
,
or
a
*NL*
fourpenny
plate
of
red
beef
from
a
cook
's
shop
;
or
a
plate
of
bread
and
*NL*
cheese
and
a
glass
of
beer
,
from
a
miserable
old
public-house
opposite
*NL*
our
place
of
business
,
called
the
Lion
,
or
the
Lion
and
something
else
*NL*
that
I
have
forgotten
.
Once
,
I
remember
carrying
my
own
bread
-LRB-
which
I
*NL*
had
brought
from
home
in
the
morning
-RRB-
under
my
arm
,
wrapped
in
a
piece
*NL*
of
paper
,
like
a
book
,
and
going
to
a
famous
alamode
beef-house
near
*NL*
Drury
Lane
,
and
ordering
a
``
small
plate
''
of
that
delicacy
to
eat
with
*NL*
it
.
What
the
waiter
thought
of
such
a
strange
little
apparition
coming
*NL*
in
all
alone
,
I
do
n't
know
;
but
I
can
see
him
now
,
staring
at
me
as
I
*NL*
ate
my
dinner
,
and
bringing
up
the
other
waiter
to
look
.
I
gave
him
a
*NL*
halfpenny
for
himself
,
and
I
wish
he
had
n't
taken
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
half-an-hour
,
I
think
,
for
tea
.
When
I
had
money
enough
,
I
*NL*
used
to
get
half-a-pint
of
ready-made
coffee
and
a
slice
of
bread
*NL*
and
butter
.
When
I
had
none
,
I
used
to
look
at
a
venison-shop
in
*NL*
Fleet-street
;
or
I
have
strolled
,
at
such
a
time
,
as
far
as
Covent
*NL*
Garden
Market
,
and
stared
at
the
pine-apples
.
I
was
fond
of
wandering
*NL*
about
the
Adelphi
,
because
it
was
a
mysterious
place
,
with
those
dark
*NL*
arches
.
I
see
myself
emerging
one
evening
from
some
of
these
arches
,
on
*NL*
a
little
public-house
close
to
the
river
,
with
an
open
space
before
it
,
*NL*
where
some
coal-heavers
were
dancing
;
to
look
at
whom
,
I
sat
down
upon
*NL*
a
bench
.
I
wonder
what
they
thought
of
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
such
a
child
,
and
so
little
,
that
frequently
when
I
went
into
the
*NL*
bar
of
a
strange
public-house
for
a
glass
of
ale
or
porter
,
to
moisten
*NL*
what
I
had
had
for
dinner
,
they
were
afraid
to
give
it
me
.
I
remember
*NL*
one
hot
evening
I
went
into
the
bar
of
a
public-house
,
and
said
to
the
*NL*
landlord
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
best
--
your
_
very
best
_
--
ale
a
glass
?
''
For
it
was
a
special
*NL*
occasion
.
I
do
n't
know
what
.
It
may
have
been
my
birth-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twopence-halfpenny
,
''
says
the
landlord
,
``
is
the
price
of
the
Genuine
*NL*
Stunning
ale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
says
I
,
producing
the
money
,
``
just
draw
me
a
glass
of
the
*NL*
Genuine
Stunning
,
if
you
please
,
with
a
good
head
to
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
looked
at
me
in
return
over
the
bar
,
from
head
to
foot
,
*NL*
with
a
strange
smile
on
his
face
;
and
instead
of
drawing
the
beer
,
*NL*
looked
round
the
screen
and
said
something
to
his
wife
.
She
came
out
*NL*
from
behind
it
,
with
her
work
in
her
hand
,
and
joined
him
in
surveying
*NL*
me
.
Here
we
stand
,
all
three
,
before
me
now
.
The
landlord
in
his
shirt
*NL*
sleeves
,
leaning
against
the
bar
window-frame
;
his
wife
looking
over
the
*NL*
little
half-door
;
and
I
,
in
some
confusion
,
looking
up
at
them
from
*NL*
outside
the
partition
.
They
asked
me
a
good
many
questions
;
as
,
what
my
*NL*
name
was
,
how
old
I
was
,
where
I
lived
,
how
I
was
employed
,
and
how
I
*NL*
came
there
.
To
all
of
which
,
that
I
might
commit
nobody
,
I
invented
,
I
*NL*
am
afraid
,
appropriate
answers
.
They
served
me
with
the
ale
,
though
I
*NL*
suspect
it
was
not
the
Genuine
Stunning
;
and
the
landlord
's
wife
,
*NL*
opening
the
little
half-door
of
the
bar
,
and
bending
down
,
gave
me
my
*NL*
money
back
,
and
gave
me
a
kiss
that
was
half
admiring
and
half
*NL*
compassionate
,
but
all
womanly
and
good
,
I
am
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
I
do
not
exaggerate
,
unconsciously
and
unintentionally
,
the
*NL*
scantiness
of
my
resources
or
the
difficulties
of
my
life
.
I
know
that
*NL*
if
a
shilling
were
given
me
by
Mr.
Quinion
at
any
time
,
I
spent
it
in
a
*NL*
dinner
or
a
tea
.
I
know
that
I
worked
,
from
morning
until
night
,
with
*NL*
common
men
and
boys
,
a
shabby
child
.
I
know
that
I
lounged
about
the
*NL*
streets
,
insufficiently
and
unsatisfactorily
fed
.
I
know
that
,
but
for
*NL*
the
mercy
of
God
,
I
might
easily
have
been
,
for
any
care
that
was
taken
*NL*
of
me
,
a
little
robber
or
a
little
vagabond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
I
held
some
station
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
too
.
Besides
that
Mr.
*NL*
Quinion
did
what
a
careless
man
so
occupied
,
and
dealing
with
a
thing
so
*NL*
anomalous
,
could
,
to
treat
me
as
one
upon
a
different
footing
from
the
*NL*
rest
,
I
never
said
,
to
man
or
boy
,
how
it
was
that
I
came
to
be
there
,
*NL*
or
gave
the
least
indication
of
being
sorry
that
I
was
there
.
That
I
*NL*
suffered
in
secret
,
and
that
I
suffered
exquisitely
,
no
one
ever
knew
*NL*
but
I
.
How
much
I
suffered
,
it
is
,
as
I
have
said
already
,
utterly
*NL*
beyond
my
power
to
tell
.
But
I
kept
my
own
counsel
,
and
I
did
my
work
.
I
*NL*
knew
from
the
first
,
that
,
if
I
could
not
do
my
work
as
well
as
any
of
*NL*
the
rest
,
I
could
not
hold
myself
above
slight
and
contempt
.
I
soon
*NL*
became
at
least
as
expeditious
and
as
skilful
as
either
of
the
other
*NL*
boys
.
Though
perfectly
familiar
with
them
,
my
conduct
and
manner
were
*NL*
different
enough
from
theirs
to
place
a
space
between
us
.
They
and
the
*NL*
men
generally
spoke
of
me
as
``
the
little
gent
,
''
or
``
the
young
*NL*
Suffolker
.
''
A
certain
man
named
Gregory
,
who
was
foreman
of
the
packers
,
*NL*
and
another
named
Tipp
,
who
was
the
carman
,
and
wore
a
red
jacket
,
used
*NL*
to
address
me
sometimes
as
``
David
:
''
but
I
think
it
was
mostly
when
we
*NL*
were
very
confidential
,
and
when
I
had
made
some
efforts
to
entertain
*NL*
them
,
over
our
work
,
with
some
results
of
the
old
readings
;
which
were
*NL*
fast
perishing
out
of
my
remembrance
.
Mealy
Potatoes
uprose
once
,
and
*NL*
rebelled
against
my
being
so
distinguished
;
but
Mick
Walker
settled
him
*NL*
in
no
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
rescue
from
this
kind
of
existence
I
considered
quite
hopeless
,
and
*NL*
abandoned
,
as
such
,
altogether
.
I
am
solemnly
convinced
that
I
never
for
*NL*
one
hour
was
reconciled
to
it
,
or
was
otherwise
than
miserably
unhappy
;
*NL*
but
I
bore
it
;
and
even
to
Peggotty
,
partly
for
the
love
of
her
and
*NL*
partly
for
shame
,
never
in
any
letter
-LRB-
though
many
passed
between
us
-RRB-
*NL*
revealed
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
's
difficulties
were
an
addition
to
the
distressed
state
of
*NL*
my
mind
.
In
my
forlorn
state
I
became
quite
attached
to
the
family
,
and
*NL*
used
to
walk
about
,
busy
with
Mrs.
Micawber
's
calculations
of
ways
and
*NL*
means
,
and
heavy
with
the
weight
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
debts
.
On
a
Saturday
*NL*
night
,
which
was
my
grand
treat
,
--
partly
because
it
was
a
great
thing
to
*NL*
walk
home
with
six
or
seven
shillings
in
my
pocket
,
looking
into
the
*NL*
shops
and
thinking
what
such
a
sum
would
buy
,
and
partly
because
I
went
*NL*
home
early
,
--
Mrs.
Micawber
would
make
the
most
heart-rending
confidences
*NL*
to
me
;
also
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
mixed
the
portion
of
tea
or
*NL*
coffee
I
had
bought
over-night
,
in
a
little
shaving
pot
,
and
sat
late
at
*NL*
my
breakfast
.
It
was
nothing
at
all
unusual
for
Mr.
Micawber
to
sob
*NL*
violently
at
the
beginning
of
one
of
these
Saturday
night
conversations
,
*NL*
and
sing
about
Jack
's
delight
being
his
lovely
Nan
,
towards
the
end
of
*NL*
it
.
I
have
known
him
come
home
to
supper
with
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
a
*NL*
declaration
that
nothing
was
now
left
but
a
jail
;
and
go
to
bed
making
a
*NL*
calculation
of
the
expense
of
putting
bow-windows
to
the
house
,
``
in
case
*NL*
anything
turned
up
,
''
which
was
his
favourite
expression
.
And
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
was
just
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
curious
equality
of
friendship
,
originating
,
I
suppose
,
in
our
*NL*
respective
circumstances
,
sprung
up
between
me
and
these
people
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
ludicrous
disparity
in
our
years
.
But
I
never
*NL*
allowed
myself
to
be
prevailed
upon
to
accept
any
invitation
to
eat
and
*NL*
drink
with
them
out
of
their
stock
-LRB-
knowing
that
they
got
on
badly
with
*NL*
the
butcher
and
baker
,
and
had
often
not
too
much
for
themselves
-RRB-
,
until
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
took
me
into
her
entire
confidence
.
This
she
did
one
*NL*
evening
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
I
make
no
stranger
of
you
,
*NL*
and
therefore
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
Mr.
Micawber
's
difficulties
*NL*
are
coming
to
a
crisis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
very
miserable
to
hear
it
,
and
I
looked
at
Mrs.
Micawber
's
*NL*
red
eyes
with
the
utmost
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
exception
of
the
heel
of
a
Dutch
cheese
--
which
is
not
adapted
*NL*
to
the
wants
of
a
young
family
''
--
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
there
is
really
*NL*
not
a
scrap
of
anything
in
the
larder
.
I
was
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
*NL*
larder
when
I
lived
with
papa
and
mama
,
and
I
use
the
word
almost
*NL*
unconsciously
.
What
I
mean
to
express
,
is
,
that
there
is
nothing
to
eat
*NL*
in
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
I
said
,
in
great
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
two
or
three
shillings
of
my
week
's
money
in
my
pocket
--
from
which
*NL*
I
presume
that
it
must
have
been
on
a
Wednesday
night
when
we
held
this
*NL*
conversation
--
and
I
hastily
produced
them
,
and
with
heartfelt
emotion
*NL*
begged
Mrs.
Micawber
to
accept
of
them
as
a
loan
.
But
that
lady
,
kissing
*NL*
me
,
and
making
me
put
them
back
in
my
pocket
,
replied
that
she
could
n't
*NL*
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
she
,
``
far
be
it
from
my
thoughts
!
*NL*
But
you
have
a
discretion
beyond
your
years
,
and
can
render
me
another
*NL*
kind
of
service
,
if
you
will
;
and
a
service
I
will
thankfully
accept
*NL*
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
begged
Mrs.
Micawber
to
name
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
parted
with
the
plate
myself
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
Six
tea
,
two
*NL*
salt
,
and
a
pair
of
sugars
,
I
have
at
different
times
borrowed
money
on
,
*NL*
in
secret
,
with
my
own
hands
.
But
the
twins
are
a
great
tie
;
and
to
me
,
*NL*
with
my
recollections
of
papa
and
mama
,
these
transactions
are
very
*NL*
painful
.
There
are
still
a
few
trifles
that
we
could
part
with
.
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
feelings
would
never
allow
_
him
_
to
dispose
of
them
;
and
*NL*
Clickett
''
--
this
was
the
girl
from
the
workhouse
--
``
being
of
a
vulgar
*NL*
mind
,
would
take
painful
liberties
if
so
much
confidence
was
reposed
in
*NL*
her
.
Master
Copperfield
,
if
I
might
ask
you
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
Mrs.
Micawber
now
,
and
begged
her
to
make
use
of
me
to
any
*NL*
extent
.
I
began
to
dispose
of
the
more
portable
articles
of
property
*NL*
that
very
evening
;
and
went
out
on
a
similar
expedition
almost
every
*NL*
morning
,
before
I
went
to
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
had
a
few
books
on
a
little
chiffonier
,
which
he
called
the
*NL*
library
;
and
those
went
first
.
I
carried
them
,
one
after
another
,
to
a
*NL*
bookstall
in
the
City
Road
--
one
part
of
which
,
near
our
house
,
was
*NL*
almost
all
bookstalls
and
bird-shops
then
--
and
sold
them
for
whatever
*NL*
they
would
bring
,
The
keeper
of
this
bookstall
,
who
lived
in
a
little
*NL*
house
behind
it
,
used
to
get
tipsy
every
night
,
and
to
be
violently
*NL*
scolded
by
his
wife
every
morning
.
More
than
once
,
when
I
went
there
*NL*
early
,
I
had
audience
of
him
in
a
turn-up
bedstead
,
with
a
cut
in
his
*NL*
forehead
or
a
black
eye
,
bearing
witness
to
his
excesses
over
night
-LRB-
I
*NL*
am
afraid
he
was
quarrelsome
in
his
drink
-RRB-
,
and
he
,
with
a
shaking
hand
,
*NL*
endeavouring
to
find
the
needful
shillings
in
one
or
other
of
the
*NL*
pockets
of
his
clothes
,
which
lay
upon
the
floor
,
while
his
wife
,
with
a
*NL*
baby
in
her
arms
and
her
shoes
down
at
heel
,
never
left
off
rating
him
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
had
lost
his
money
,
and
then
he
would
ask
me
to
call
again
;
*NL*
but
his
wife
had
always
got
some
--
had
taken
his
,
I
dare
say
,
while
he
*NL*
was
drunk
--
and
secretly
completed
the
bargain
on
the
stairs
,
as
we
went
*NL*
down
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
too
,
I
began
to
be
very
well
known
.
The
*NL*
principal
gentleman
who
officiated
behind
the
counter
,
took
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
notice
of
me
;
and
often
got
me
,
I
recollect
,
to
decline
a
Latin
noun
*NL*
or
adjective
,
or
to
conjugate
a
Latin
verb
,
in
his
ear
,
while
he
*NL*
transacted
my
business
.
After
all
these
occasions
Mrs.
Micawber
made
a
*NL*
little
treat
,
which
was
generally
a
supper
;
and
there
was
a
peculiar
*NL*
relish
in
these
meals
which
I
well
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mr.
Micawber
's
difficulties
came
to
a
crisis
,
and
he
was
*NL*
arrested
early
one
morning
,
and
carried
over
to
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
*NL*
in
the
Borough
.
He
told
me
,
as
he
went
out
of
the
house
,
that
the
God
of
*NL*
day
had
now
gone
down
upon
him
--
and
I
really
thought
his
heart
was
*NL*
broken
and
mine
too
.
But
I
heard
,
afterwards
,
that
he
was
seen
to
play
a
*NL*
lively
game
at
skittles
,
before
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
Sunday
after
he
was
taken
there
,
I
was
to
go
and
see
him
,
*NL*
and
have
dinner
with
him
.
I
was
to
ask
my
way
to
such
a
place
,
and
just
*NL*
short
of
that
place
I
should
see
such
another
place
,
and
just
short
of
*NL*
that
I
should
see
a
yard
,
which
I
was
to
cross
,
and
keep
straight
on
*NL*
until
I
saw
a
turnkey
.
All
this
I
did
;
and
when
at
last
I
did
see
a
*NL*
turnkey
-LRB-
poor
little
fellow
that
I
was
!
-RRB-
,
and
thought
how
,
when
Roderick
*NL*
Random
was
in
a
debtor
's
prison
,
there
was
a
man
there
with
nothing
on
*NL*
him
but
an
old
rug
,
the
turnkey
swam
before
my
dimmed
eyes
and
my
*NL*
beating
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
waiting
for
me
within
the
gate
,
and
we
went
up
to
his
*NL*
room
-LRB-
top
story
but
one
-RRB-
,
and
cried
very
much
.
He
solemnly
conjured
me
,
*NL*
I
remember
,
to
take
warning
by
his
fate
;
and
to
observe
that
if
a
man
*NL*
had
twenty
pounds
a-year
for
his
income
,
and
spent
nineteen
pounds
*NL*
nineteen
shillings
and
sixpence
,
he
would
be
happy
,
but
that
if
he
spent
*NL*
twenty
pounds
one
he
would
be
miserable
.
After
which
he
borrowed
a
*NL*
shilling
of
me
for
porter
,
gave
me
a
written
order
on
Mrs.
Micawber
for
*NL*
the
amount
,
and
put
away
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
cheered
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
before
a
little
fire
,
with
two
bricks
put
within
the
rusted
*NL*
grate
,
one
on
each
side
,
to
prevent
its
burning
too
many
coals
;
until
*NL*
another
debtor
,
who
shared
the
room
with
Mr.
Micawber
,
came
in
from
the
*NL*
bakehouse
with
the
loin
of
mutton
which
was
our
joint-stock
repast
.
Then
*NL*
I
was
sent
up
to
``
Captain
Hopkins
''
in
the
room
overhead
,
with
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
compliments
,
and
I
was
his
young
friend
,
and
would
Captain
*NL*
Hopkins
lend
me
a
knife
and
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Hopkins
lent
me
the
knife
and
fork
,
with
his
compliments
to
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
.
There
was
a
very
dirty
lady
in
his
little
room
,
and
two
wan
*NL*
girls
,
his
daughters
,
with
shock
heads
of
hair
.
I
thought
it
was
better
*NL*
to
borrow
Captain
Hopkins
's
knife
and
fork
,
than
Captain
Hopkins
's
comb
.
*NL*
The
Captain
himself
was
in
the
last
extremity
of
shabbiness
,
with
large
*NL*
whiskers
,
and
an
old
,
old
brown
great-coat
with
no
other
coat
below
it
.
*NL*
I
saw
his
bed
rolled
up
in
a
corner
;
and
what
plates
and
dishes
and
pots
*NL*
he
had
,
on
a
shelf
;
and
I
divined
-LRB-
God
knows
how
-RRB-
that
though
the
two
*NL*
girls
with
the
shock
heads
of
hair
were
Captain
Hopkins
's
children
,
the
*NL*
dirty
lady
was
not
married
to
Captain
Hopkins
.
My
timid
station
on
his
*NL*
threshhold
was
not
occupied
more
than
a
couple
of
minutes
at
most
;
but
I
*NL*
came
down
again
with
all
this
in
my
knowledge
,
as
surely
as
the
knife
*NL*
and
fork
were
in
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
gipsy-like
and
agreeable
in
the
dinner
,
after
all
.
I
*NL*
took
back
Captain
Hopkins
's
knife
and
fork
early
in
the
afternoon
,
and
*NL*
went
home
to
comfort
Mrs.
Micawber
with
an
account
of
my
visit
.
She
*NL*
fainted
when
she
saw
me
return
,
and
made
a
little
jug
of
egg-hot
*NL*
afterwards
to
console
us
while
we
talked
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
the
household
furniture
came
to
be
sold
for
the
family
*NL*
benefit
,
or
who
sold
it
,
except
that
_
I
_
did
not
.
Sold
it
was
,
however
,
*NL*
and
carried
away
in
a
van
;
except
the
bed
,
a
few
chairs
,
and
the
*NL*
kitchen-table
.
With
these
possessions
we
encamped
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
*NL*
two
parlors
of
the
emptied
house
in
Windsor
Terrace
;
Mrs.
Micawber
,
the
*NL*
children
,
the
Orfling
,
and
myself
;
and
lived
in
those
rooms
night
and
*NL*
day
.
I
have
no
idea
for
how
long
,
though
it
seems
to
me
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
At
last
Mrs.
Micawber
resolved
to
move
into
the
prison
,
where
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
had
now
secured
a
room
to
himself
.
So
I
took
the
key
of
the
*NL*
house
to
the
landlord
,
who
was
very
glad
to
get
it
;
and
the
beds
were
*NL*
sent
over
to
the
King
's
Bench
,
except
mine
,
for
which
a
little
room
was
*NL*
hired
outside
the
walls
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
Institution
,
very
*NL*
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
since
the
Micawbers
and
I
had
become
too
used
*NL*
to
one
another
,
in
our
troubles
,
to
part
.
The
Orfling
was
likewise
*NL*
accommodated
with
an
inexpensive
lodging
in
the
same
neighbourhood
.
Mine
*NL*
was
a
quiet
back-garret
with
a
sloping
roof
,
commanding
a
pleasant
*NL*
prospect
of
a
timber-yard
;
and
when
I
took
possession
of
it
,
with
the
*NL*
reflection
that
Mr.
Micawber
's
troubles
had
come
to
a
crisis
at
last
,
I
*NL*
thought
it
quite
a
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
I
was
working
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
in
the
same
common
*NL*
way
,
and
with
the
same
common
companions
,
and
with
the
same
sense
of
*NL*
unmerited
degradation
as
at
first
.
But
I
never
,
happily
for
me
no
doubt
,
*NL*
made
a
single
acquaintance
,
or
spoke
to
any
of
the
many
boys
whom
I
saw
*NL*
daily
in
going
to
the
warehouse
,
in
coming
from
it
,
and
in
prowling
*NL*
about
the
streets
at
meal-times
.
I
led
the
same
secretly
unhappy
life
;
*NL*
but
I
led
it
in
the
same
lonely
,
self-reliant
manner
.
The
only
changes
I
*NL*
am
conscious
of
are
,
firstly
,
that
I
had
grown
more
shabby
,
and
*NL*
secondly
,
that
I
was
now
relieved
of
much
of
the
weight
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
's
cares
;
for
some
relatives
or
friends
had
engaged
to
help
them
*NL*
at
their
present
pass
,
and
they
lived
more
comfortably
in
the
prison
*NL*
than
they
had
lived
for
a
long
while
out
of
it
.
I
used
to
breakfast
with
*NL*
them
now
,
in
virtue
of
some
arrangement
,
of
which
I
have
forgotten
the
*NL*
details
.
I
forget
,
too
,
at
what
hour
the
gates
were
opened
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
admitting
of
my
going
in
;
but
I
know
that
I
was
often
up
at
six
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
that
my
favorite
lounging-place
in
the
interval
was
old
*NL*
London
Bridge
,
where
I
was
wont
to
sit
in
one
of
the
stone
recesses
,
*NL*
watching
the
people
going
by
,
or
to
look
over
the
balustrades
at
the
sun
*NL*
shining
in
the
water
,
and
lighting
up
the
golden
flame
on
the
top
of
the
*NL*
Monument
.
The
Orfling
met
me
here
sometimes
,
to
be
told
some
astonishing
*NL*
fictions
respecting
the
wharves
and
the
Tower
;
of
which
I
can
say
no
*NL*
more
than
that
I
hope
I
believed
them
myself
.
In
the
evening
I
used
to
*NL*
go
back
to
the
prison
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
parade
with
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
;
or
play
casino
with
Mrs.
Micawber
,
and
hear
reminiscences
of
*NL*
her
papa
and
mama
.
Whether
Mr.
Murdstone
knew
where
I
was
,
I
am
unable
*NL*
to
say
.
I
never
told
them
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
's
affairs
,
although
past
their
crisis
,
were
very
much
*NL*
involved
by
reason
of
a
certain
``
Deed
,
''
of
which
I
used
to
hear
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
and
which
I
suppose
,
now
,
to
have
been
some
former
composition
*NL*
with
his
creditors
,
though
I
was
so
far
from
being
clear
about
it
then
,
*NL*
that
I
am
conscious
of
having
confounded
it
with
those
demoniacal
*NL*
parchments
which
are
held
to
have
,
once
upon
a
time
,
obtained
to
a
great
*NL*
extent
in
Germany
.
At
last
this
document
appeared
to
be
got
out
of
the
*NL*
way
,
somehow
;
at
all
events
it
ceased
to
be
the
rock-ahead
it
had
been
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Micawber
informed
me
that
``
her
family
''
had
decided
that
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
should
apply
for
his
release
under
the
Insolvent
Debtors
Act
,
*NL*
which
would
set
him
free
,
she
expected
,
in
about
six
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
who
was
present
,
``
I
have
no
doubt
I
*NL*
shall
,
please
Heaven
,
begin
to
be
beforehand
with
the
world
,
and
to
live
*NL*
in
a
perfectly
new
manner
,
if
--
in
short
,
if
anything
turns
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
going
in
for
anything
that
might
be
on
the
cards
,
I
call
to
*NL*
mind
that
Mr.
Micawber
,
about
this
time
,
composed
a
petition
to
the
*NL*
House
of
Commons
,
praying
for
an
alteration
in
the
law
of
imprisonment
*NL*
for
debt
.
I
set
down
this
remembrance
here
,
because
it
is
an
instance
to
*NL*
myself
of
the
manner
in
which
I
fitted
my
old
books
to
my
altered
life
,
*NL*
and
made
stories
for
myself
,
out
of
the
streets
,
and
out
of
men
and
*NL*
women
;
and
how
some
main
points
in
the
character
I
shall
unconsciously
*NL*
develope
,
I
suppose
,
in
writing
my
life
,
were
gradually
forming
all
this
*NL*
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
club
in
the
prison
,
in
which
Mr.
Micawber
,
as
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
was
a
great
authority
.
Mr.
Micawber
had
stated
his
idea
of
this
petition
*NL*
to
the
club
,
and
the
club
had
strongly
approved
of
the
same
.
Wherefore
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
-LRB-
who
was
a
thoroughly
good-natured
man
,
and
as
active
a
*NL*
creature
about
everything
but
his
own
affairs
as
ever
existed
,
and
never
*NL*
so
happy
as
when
he
was
busy
about
something
that
could
never
be
of
any
*NL*
profit
to
him
-RRB-
set
to
work
at
the
petition
,
invented
it
,
engrossed
it
on
*NL*
an
immense
sheet
of
paper
,
spread
it
out
on
a
table
,
and
appointed
a
*NL*
time
for
all
the
club
,
and
all
within
the
walls
if
they
chose
,
to
come
*NL*
up
to
his
room
and
sign
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
heard
of
this
approaching
ceremony
,
I
was
so
anxious
to
see
them
*NL*
all
come
in
,
one
after
another
,
though
I
knew
the
greater
part
of
them
*NL*
already
,
and
they
me
,
that
I
got
an
hour
's
leave
of
absence
from
*NL*
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
and
established
myself
in
a
corner
for
that
*NL*
purpose
.
As
many
of
the
principal
members
of
the
club
as
could
be
got
*NL*
into
the
small
room
without
filling
it
,
supported
Mr.
Micawber
in
front
*NL*
of
the
petition
,
while
my
old
friend
Captain
Hopkins
-LRB-
who
had
washed
*NL*
himself
,
to
do
honor
to
so
solemn
an
occasion
-RRB-
stationed
himself
close
*NL*
to
it
,
to
read
it
to
all
who
were
unacquainted
with
its
contents
.
The
*NL*
door
was
then
thrown
open
,
and
the
general
population
began
to
come
in
,
*NL*
in
a
long
file
:
several
waiting
outside
,
while
one
entered
,
affixed
his
*NL*
signature
,
and
went
out
.
To
everybody
in
succession
,
Captain
Hopkins
*NL*
said
:
``
Have
you
read
it
?
''
--
``
No
.
''
--
``
Would
you
like
to
hear
it
read
?
''
If
*NL*
he
weakly
showed
the
least
disposition
to
hear
it
,
Captain
Hopkins
,
in
a
*NL*
loud
sonorous
voice
,
gave
him
every
word
of
it
.
The
Captain
would
have
*NL*
read
it
twenty
thousand
times
,
if
twenty
thousand
people
would
have
*NL*
heard
him
,
one
by
one
.
I
remember
a
certain
luscious
roll
he
gave
to
*NL*
such
phrases
as
``
The
people
's
representatives
in
Parliament
assembled
,
''
*NL*
``
Your
petitioners
therefore
humbly
approach
your
honorable
house
,
''
``
His
*NL*
gracious
Majesty
's
unfortunate
subjects
,
''
as
if
the
words
were
something
*NL*
real
in
his
mouth
,
and
delicious
to
taste
;
Mr.
Micawber
,
meanwhile
,
*NL*
listening
with
a
little
of
an
author
's
vanity
,
and
contemplating
-LRB-
not
*NL*
severely
-RRB-
the
spikes
on
the
opposite
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
walked
to
and
fro
daily
between
Southwark
and
Blackfriars
,
and
*NL*
lounged
about
at
meal-times
in
obscure
streets
,
the
stones
of
which
may
,
*NL*
for
anything
I
know
,
be
worn
at
this
moment
by
my
childish
feet
,
I
*NL*
wonder
how
many
of
these
people
were
wanting
in
the
crowd
that
used
to
*NL*
come
filing
before
me
in
review
again
,
to
the
echo
of
Captain
Hopkins
's
*NL*
voice
!
When
my
thoughts
go
back
,
now
,
to
that
slow
agony
of
my
youth
,
I
*NL*
wonder
how
much
of
the
histories
I
invented
for
such
people
hangs
like
a
*NL*
mist
of
fancy
over
well-remembered
facts
!
When
I
tread
the
old
ground
,
I
*NL*
do
not
wonder
that
I
seem
to
see
and
pity
,
going
on
before
me
,
an
*NL*
innocent
romantic
boy
,
making
his
imaginative
world
out
of
such
strange
*NL*
experiences
and
sordid
things
!

CHAPTER
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
LIKING
LIFE
ON
MY
OWN
ACCOUNT
NO
BETTER
,
I
FORM
A
GREAT
RESOLUTION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
time
,
Mr.
Micawber
's
petition
was
ripe
for
hearing
;
and
that
*NL*
gentleman
was
ordered
to
be
discharged
under
the
act
,
to
my
great
joy
.
*NL*
His
creditors
were
not
implacable
;
and
Mrs.
Micawber
informed
me
that
*NL*
even
the
revengeful
bootmaker
had
declared
in
open
court
that
he
bore
*NL*
him
no
malice
,
but
that
when
money
was
owing
to
him
he
liked
to
be
paid
.
*NL*
He
said
he
thought
it
was
human
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
returned
to
the
King
's
Bench
when
his
case
was
over
,
as
*NL*
some
fees
were
to
be
settled
,
and
some
formalities
observed
,
before
he
*NL*
could
be
actually
released
.
The
club
received
him
with
transport
,
and
*NL*
held
an
harmonic
meeting
that
evening
in
his
honor
;
while
Mrs.
Micawber
*NL*
and
I
had
a
lamb
's
fry
in
private
,
surrounded
by
the
sleeping
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
such
an
occasion
I
will
give
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
``
in
a
little
more
flip
,
''
for
we
had
been
having
some
already
,
*NL*
``
the
memory
of
my
papa
and
mama
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
dead
,
ma'am
?
''
I
enquired
,
after
drinking
the
toast
in
a
*NL*
wine-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mama
departed
this
life
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
before
Mr.
Micawber
's
*NL*
difficulties
commenced
,
or
at
least
before
they
became
pressing
.
My
papa
*NL*
lived
to
bail
Mr.
Micawber
several
times
,
and
then
expired
,
regretted
by
*NL*
a
numerous
circle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
shook
her
head
,
and
dropped
a
pious
tear
upon
the
twin
who
*NL*
happened
to
be
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
could
hardly
hope
for
a
more
favourable
opportunity
of
putting
a
*NL*
question
in
which
I
had
a
near
interest
,
I
said
to
Mrs.
Micawber
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
,
ma'am
,
what
you
and
Mr.
Micawber
intend
to
do
,
now
that
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
is
out
of
his
difficulties
,
and
at
liberty
?
Have
you
settled
*NL*
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
family
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
who
always
said
those
two
words
with
an
*NL*
air
,
though
I
never
could
discover
who
came
under
the
denomination
,
``
my
*NL*
family
are
of
opinion
that
Mr.
Micawber
should
quit
London
,
and
exert
*NL*
his
talents
in
the
country
.
Mr.
Micawber
is
a
man
of
great
talent
,
*NL*
Master
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
was
sure
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
great
talent
,
''
repeated
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
My
family
are
of
opinion
,
*NL*
that
,
with
a
little
interest
,
something
might
be
done
for
a
man
of
his
*NL*
ability
in
the
Custom
House
.
The
influence
of
my
family
being
local
,
it
*NL*
is
their
wish
that
Mr.
Micawber
should
go
down
to
Plymouth
.
They
think
*NL*
it
indispensable
that
he
should
be
upon
the
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
may
be
ready
?
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
That
he
may
be
ready
--
in
case
of
*NL*
anything
turning
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
go
too
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
events
of
the
day
,
in
combination
with
the
twins
,
if
not
with
the
*NL*
flip
,
had
made
Mrs.
Micawber
hysterical
,
and
she
shed
tears
as
she
*NL*
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
will
desert
Mr.
Micawber
.
Mr.
Micawber
may
have
concealed
his
*NL*
difficulties
from
me
in
the
first
instance
,
but
his
sanguine
temper
may
*NL*
have
led
him
to
expect
that
he
would
overcome
them
.
The
pearl
necklace
*NL*
and
bracelets
which
I
inherited
from
mama
,
have
been
disposed
of
for
*NL*
less
than
half
their
value
;
and
the
set
of
coral
,
which
was
the
wedding
*NL*
gift
of
my
papa
,
has
been
actually
thrown
away
for
nothing
.
But
I
never
*NL*
will
desert
Mr.
Micawber
.
No
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Micawber
,
more
affected
than
*NL*
before
,
``
I
never
will
do
it
!
It
's
of
no
use
asking
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
quite
uncomfortable
--
as
if
Mrs.
Micawber
supposed
I
had
asked
her
*NL*
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
!
--
and
sat
looking
at
her
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Micawber
has
his
faults
.
I
do
not
deny
that
he
is
improvident
.
I
do
*NL*
not
deny
that
he
has
kept
me
in
the
dark
as
to
his
resources
and
his
*NL*
liabilities
,
both
,
''
she
went
on
,
looking
at
the
wall
;
``
but
I
never
will
*NL*
desert
Mr.
Micawber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
having
now
raised
her
voice
into
a
perfect
scream
,
I
was
*NL*
so
frightened
that
I
ran
off
to
the
club-room
,
and
disturbed
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
in
the
act
of
presiding
at
a
long
table
,
and
leading
the
chorus
*NL*
of
*NL*
*NL*
Gee
up
,
Dobbin
,
*NL*
Gee
ho
,
Dobbin
,
*NL*
Gee
up
,
Dobbin
,
*NL*
Gee
up
,
and
gee
ho
--
o
--
o
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
with
the
tidings
that
Mrs.
Micawber
was
in
an
alarming
state
,
upon
*NL*
which
he
immediately
burst
into
tears
,
and
came
away
with
me
with
his
*NL*
waistcoat
full
of
the
heads
and
tails
of
shrimps
,
of
which
he
had
been
*NL*
partaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
,
my
angel
!
''
cried
Mr.
Micawber
,
running
into
the
room
;
``
what
is
*NL*
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
will
desert
you
,
Micawber
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
!
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
taking
her
in
his
arms
.
``
I
am
perfectly
*NL*
aware
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
parent
of
my
children
!
He
is
the
father
of
my
twins
!
He
is
*NL*
the
husband
of
my
affections
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Micawber
,
struggling
;
``
and
I
*NL*
ne
--
ver
--
will
--
desert
Mr.
Micawber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
so
deeply
affected
by
this
proof
of
her
devotion
-LRB-
as
to
*NL*
me
,
I
was
dissolved
in
tears
-RRB-
,
that
he
hung
over
her
in
a
passionate
*NL*
manner
,
imploring
her
to
look
up
,
and
to
be
calm
.
But
the
more
he
asked
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
to
look
up
,
the
more
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
nothing
;
and
*NL*
the
more
he
asked
her
to
compose
herself
,
the
more
she
would
n't
.
*NL*
Consequently
Mr.
Micawber
was
soon
so
overcome
,
that
he
mingled
his
*NL*
tears
with
hers
and
mine
;
until
he
begged
me
to
do
him
the
favor
of
*NL*
taking
a
chair
on
the
staircase
,
while
he
got
her
into
bed
.
I
would
have
*NL*
taken
my
leave
for
the
night
,
but
he
would
not
hear
of
my
doing
that
*NL*
until
the
strangers
'
bell
should
ring
.
So
I
sat
at
the
staircase
window
,
*NL*
until
he
came
out
with
another
chair
and
joined
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Mrs.
Micawber
now
,
sir
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
low
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
shaking
his
head
;
``
re-action
.
Ah
,
this
*NL*
has
been
a
dreadful
day
!
We
stand
alone
now
--
everything
is
gone
from
*NL*
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
pressed
my
hand
,
and
groaned
,
and
afterwards
shed
tears
.
I
*NL*
was
greatly
touched
,
and
disappointed
too
,
for
I
had
expected
that
we
*NL*
should
be
quite
gay
on
this
happy
and
long-looked
for
occasion
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Micawber
were
so
used
to
their
old
difficulties
,
I
think
,
that
*NL*
they
felt
quite
shipwrecked
when
they
came
to
consider
that
they
were
*NL*
released
from
them
.
All
their
elasticity
was
departed
,
and
I
never
saw
*NL*
them
half
so
wretched
as
on
this
night
;
insomuch
that
when
the
bell
*NL*
rang
,
and
Mr.
Micawber
walked
with
me
to
the
lodge
,
and
parted
from
me
*NL*
there
with
a
blessing
,
I
felt
quite
afraid
to
leave
him
by
himself
,
he
*NL*
was
so
profoundly
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
through
all
the
confusion
and
lowness
of
spirits
in
which
we
had
*NL*
been
,
so
unexpectedly
to
me
,
involved
,
I
plainly
discerned
that
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
and
their
family
were
going
away
from
London
,
and
that
a
*NL*
parting
between
us
was
near
at
hand
.
It
was
in
my
walk
home
that
night
,
*NL*
and
in
the
sleepless
hours
which
followed
when
I
lay
in
bed
,
that
the
*NL*
thought
first
occurred
to
me
--
though
I
do
n't
know
how
it
came
into
my
*NL*
head
--
which
afterwards
shaped
itself
into
a
settled
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
grown
to
be
so
accustomed
to
the
Micawbers
,
and
had
been
so
*NL*
intimate
with
them
in
their
distresses
,
and
was
so
utterly
friendless
*NL*
without
them
,
that
the
prospect
of
being
thrown
upon
some
new
shift
for
*NL*
a
lodging
,
and
going
once
more
among
unknown
people
,
was
like
being
that
*NL*
moment
turned
adrift
into
my
present
life
,
with
such
a
knowledge
of
it
*NL*
ready
made
,
as
experience
had
given
me
.
All
the
sensitive
feelings
it
*NL*
wounded
so
cruelly
,
all
the
shame
and
misery
it
kept
alive
within
my
*NL*
breast
,
became
more
poignant
as
I
thought
of
this
;
and
I
determined
that
*NL*
the
life
was
unendurable
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
there
was
no
hope
of
escape
from
it
,
unless
the
escape
was
my
own
*NL*
act
,
I
knew
quite
well
.
I
rarely
heard
from
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
never
*NL*
from
Mr.
Murdstone
:
but
two
or
three
parcels
of
made
or
mended
clothes
*NL*
had
come
up
for
me
,
consigned
to
Mr.
Quinion
,
and
in
each
there
was
a
*NL*
scrap
of
paper
to
the
effect
that
J.
M.
trusted
D.
C.
was
applying
*NL*
himself
to
business
,
and
devoting
himself
wholly
to
his
duties
--
not
the
*NL*
least
hint
of
my
ever
being
any
thing
else
than
the
common
drudge
into
*NL*
which
I
was
fast
settling
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
day
showed
me
,
while
my
mind
was
in
the
first
agitation
of
*NL*
what
it
had
conceived
,
that
Mrs.
Micawber
had
not
spoken
of
their
going
*NL*
away
without
warrant
.
They
took
a
lodging
in
the
house
where
I
lived
,
*NL*
for
a
week
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
they
were
to
start
for
*NL*
Plymouth
.
Mr.
Micawber
himself
came
down
to
the
counting-house
,
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
to
tell
Mr.
Quinion
that
he
must
relinquish
me
on
the
day
of
*NL*
his
departure
,
and
to
give
me
a
high
character
,
which
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
deserved
.
And
Mr.
Quinion
,
calling
in
Tipp
the
carman
,
who
was
a
married
*NL*
man
,
and
had
a
room
to
let
,
quartered
me
prospectively
on
him
--
by
our
*NL*
mutual
consent
,
as
he
had
every
reason
to
think
;
for
I
said
nothing
,
*NL*
though
my
resolution
was
now
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
my
evenings
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
,
during
the
remaining
*NL*
term
of
our
residence
under
the
same
roof
;
and
I
think
we
became
fonder
*NL*
of
one
another
as
the
time
went
on
.
On
the
last
Sunday
,
they
invited
me
*NL*
to
dinner
;
and
we
had
a
loin
of
pork
and
apple
sauce
,
and
a
pudding
.
I
*NL*
had
bought
a
spotted
wooden
horse
over-night
as
a
parting
gift
to
little
*NL*
Wilkins
Micawber
--
that
was
the
boy
--
and
a
doll
for
little
Emma
.
I
had
*NL*
also
bestowed
a
shilling
on
the
Orfling
,
who
was
about
to
be
disbanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
very
pleasant
day
,
though
we
were
all
in
a
tender
state
about
*NL*
our
approaching
separation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
revert
to
the
*NL*
period
when
Mr.
Micawber
was
in
difficulties
,
without
thinking
of
you

*NL*
Your
conduct
has
always
been
of
the
most
delicate
and
obliging
*NL*
description
.
You
have
never
been
a
lodger
.
You
have
been
a
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear

said
Mr.
Micawber
;
``
Copperfield

for
so
he
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
call
me

of
late

a

plan

and
a

in
short
,
a
general
ability
to
dispose
of
such
*NL*
available
property
as
could
be
made
away
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
my
sense
of
this
commendation
,
and
said
I
was
very
sorry
we
*NL*
were
going
to
lose
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``

I
may
say

hourly
expecting

I
have
nothing

Still
my

is
so

Mr.

been
beaming
and
smiling
,
all
over
his
head
and
face
,
up
to
the
present
*NL*
moment
,
checked
himself
and
frowned

``

miserable

*NL*

urged
his
wife

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say

returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
quite
forgetting
himself
,
and
smiling
*NL*
again
,
``
the
miserable
wretch
you
behold

My
advice
is
,
never
do

to-morrow
what

Procrastination

*NL*
Collar

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
papa
's
maxim
,
''
Mrs.
Micawber
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
your
papa
was
very
well
in

Heaven

the

and
able
to

But
he
applied
*NL*
that
maxim
to

and
that
was
so
far
prematurely
*NL*
entered
into
,
in

that
I
never
recovered

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
looked
aside
at
Mrs.
Micawber
,
and
added
:
``
Not
that
I
am
*NL*
sorry
for
it
.
Quite
the
contrary

love

After
which

he
was
grave
*NL*
for
a
minute
or
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
other
piece
of
advice

Copperfield

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``

As

''
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
his
example
the
more
impressive
,
Mr.
Micawber
drank
a
glass
of
*NL*
punch
with
an
air
of
great
enjoyment
and
satisfaction
,
and
whistled
the
*NL*
College
Hornpipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
fail
to
assure
him
that
I
would
store
these
precepts
in
*NL*
my
mind
,
though
indeed
I
had
no
need
to
do
so
,
for
,
at
the
time
,
*NL*
they
affected
me
visibly
.
Next
morning
I
met
the
whole
family
at
the
*NL*
coach-office
,
and
saw
them
,
with
a
desolate
heart
,
take
their
places
*NL*
outside
,
at
the
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
God
bless
you
!
I
never
can
*NL*
forget
all

you
know

and
I
never

I
could

*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
farewell
!
Every
happiness
and
*NL*
prosperity

If
,
in
the
progress
of
revolving
years
,
I
could
persuade
*NL*
myself
that
my
blighted
destiny
had
been
a
warning
to
you
,
I
should
feel
*NL*
that
I
had
not
occupied
another
man

place
in
existence
altogether
in
*NL*
vain
.
In
case
of
anything
turning
up
-LRB-
of
which
I
am
rather
confident
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
extremely
happy
if
it
should
be
in
my
power
to
improve
your
*NL*
prospects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
,
as
Mrs.
Micawber
sat
at
the
back
of
the
coach
,
with
the
*NL*
children
,
and
I
stood
in
the
road
looking
wistfully
at
them
,
a
mist
*NL*
cleared
from
her
eyes
,
and
she
saw
what
a
little
creature
I
really
was
.
*NL*
I
think
so
,
because
she
beckoned
to
me
to
climb
up
,
with
quite
a
new
and
*NL*
motherly
expression
in
her
face
,
and
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
,
and
gave
*NL*
me
just
such
a
kiss
as
she
might
have
given
to
her
own
boy
.
I
had
barely
*NL*
time
to
get
down
again
before
the
coach
started
,
and
I
could
hardly
see
*NL*
the
family
for
the
handkerchiefs
they
waved
.
It
was
gone
in
a
minute
.
*NL*
The
Orfling
and
I
stood
looking
vacantly
at
each
other
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
road
,
and
then
shook
hands
and
said
good
bye
;
she
going
back
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
to
Saint
Luke
's
workhouse
,
as
I
went
to
begin
my
weary
day
at
*NL*
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
no
intention
of
passing
many
more
weary
days
there
.
No
.
I
had
*NL*
resolved
to
run
away
.
--
To
go
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
down
into
the
*NL*
country
,
to
the
only
relation
I
had
in
the
world
,
and
tell
my
story
to
*NL*
my
aunt
,
Miss
Betsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
observed
that
I
do
n't
know
how
this
desperate
idea
came
*NL*
into
my
brain
.
But
,
once
there
,
it
remained
there
;
and
hardened
into
a
*NL*
purpose
than
which
I
have
never
entertained
a
more
determined
purpose
in
*NL*
my
life
.
I
am
far
from
sure
that
I
believed
there
was
anything
hopeful
*NL*
in
it
,
but
my
mind
was
thoroughly
made
up
that
it
must
be
carried
into
*NL*
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
and
again
,
and
a
hundred
times
again
,
since
the
night
when
the
*NL*
thought
had
first
occurred
to
me
and
banished
sleep
,
I
had
gone
over
*NL*
that
old
story
of
my
poor
mother
's
about
my
birth
,
which
it
had
been
one
*NL*
of
my
great
delights
in
the
old
time
to
hear
her
tell
,
and
which
I
knew
*NL*
by
heart
.
My
aunt
walked
into
that
story
,
and
walked
out
of
it
,
a
dread
*NL*
and
awful
personage
;
but
there
was
one
little
trait
in
her
behaviour
*NL*
which
I
liked
to
dwell
on
,
and
which
gave
me
some
faint
shadow
of
*NL*
encouragement
.
I
could
not
forget
how
my
mother
had
thought
that
she
*NL*
felt
her
touch
her
pretty
hair
with
no
ungentle
hand
;
and
though
it
*NL*
might
have
been
altogether
my
mother
's
fancy
,
and
might
have
had
no
*NL*
foundation
whatever
in
fact
,
I
made
a
little
picture
,
out
of
it
,
of
my
*NL*
terrible
aunt
relenting
towards
the
girlish
beauty
that
I
recollected
so
*NL*
well
and
loved
so
much
,
which
softened
the
whole
narrative
.
It
is
very
*NL*
possible
that
it
had
been
in
my
mind
a
long
time
,
and
had
gradually
*NL*
engendered
my
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
did
not
even
know
where
Miss
Betsey
lived
,
I
wrote
a
long
letter
to
*NL*
Peggotty
,
and
asked
her
,
incidentally
,
if
she
remembered
;
pretending
*NL*
that
I
had
heard
of
such
a
lady
living
at
a
certain
place
I
named
at
*NL*
random
,
and
had
a
curiosity
to
know
if
it
were
the
same
.
In
the
course
*NL*
of
that
letter
,
I
told
Peggotty
that
I
had
a
particular
occasion
for
*NL*
half
a
guinea
;
and
that
if
she
could
lend
me
that
sum
until
I
could
*NL*
repay
it
,
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
her
,
and
would
tell
her
*NL*
afterwards
what
I
had
wanted
it
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
's
answer
soon
arrived
,
and
was
,
as
usual
,
full
of
affectionate
*NL*
devotion
.
She
enclosed
the
half
guinea
-LRB-
I
was
afraid
she
must
have
had
a
*NL*
world
of
trouble
to
get
it
out
of
Mr.
Barkis
's
box
-RRB-
,
and
told
me
that
*NL*
Miss
Betsey
lived
near
Dover
,
but
whether
at
Dover
itself
,
at
Hythe
,
*NL*
Sandgate
,
or
Folkstone
,
she
could
not
say
.
One
of
our
men
,
however
,
*NL*
informing
me
on
my
asking
him
about
these
places
,
that
they
were
all
*NL*
close
together
,
I
deemed
this
enough
for
my
object
,
and
resolved
to
set
*NL*
out
at
the
end
of
that
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
a
very
honest
little
creature
,
and
unwilling
to
disgrace
the
*NL*
memory
I
was
going
to
leave
behind
me
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
I
*NL*
considered
myself
bound
to
remain
until
Saturday
night
;
and
,
as
I
had
*NL*
been
paid
a
week
's
wages
in
advance
when
I
first
came
there
,
not
to
*NL*
present
myself
in
the
counting-house
at
the
usual
hour
,
to
receive
my
*NL*
stipend
.
For
this
express
reason
,
I
had
borrowed
the
half-guinea
,
that
I
*NL*
might
not
be
without
a
fund
for
my
travelling-expenses
.
Accordingly
,
*NL*
when
the
Saturday
night
came
,
and
we
were
all
waiting
in
the
warehouse
*NL*
to
be
paid
,
and
Tipp
the
carman
,
who
always
took
precedence
,
went
in
*NL*
first
to
draw
his
money
,
I
shook
Mick
Walker
by
the
hand
;
asked
him
when
*NL*
it
came
to
his
turn
to
be
paid
,
to
say
to
Mr.
Quinion
that
I
had
gone
to
*NL*
move
my
box
to
Tipp
's
;
and
,
bidding
a
last
good
night
to
Mealy
Potatoes
,
*NL*
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
box
was
at
my
old
lodging
,
over
the
water
,
and
I
had
written
a
*NL*
direction
for
it
on
the
back
of
one
of
our
address
cards
that
we
nailed
*NL*
on
the
casks
:
``
Master
David
,
to
be
left
till
called
for
,
at
the
Coach
*NL*
Office
,
Dover
.
''
This
I
had
in
my
pocket
ready
to
put
on
the
box
,
after
I
*NL*
should
have
got
it
out
of
the
house
;
and
as
I
went
towards
my
lodging
,
I
*NL*
looked
about
me
for
some
one
who
would
help
me
to
carry
it
to
the
*NL*
booking-office
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long-legged
young
man
with
a
very
little
empty
donkey-cart
,
*NL*
standing
near
the
Obelisk
,
in
the
Blackfriars
Road
,
whose
eye
I
caught
*NL*
as
I
was
going
by
,
and
who
,
addressing
me
as
``
Sixpenn
`
orth
of
bad
*NL*
ha
`
pence
,
''
hoped
``
I
should
know
him
agin
to
swear
to
''
--
in
allusion
,
I
*NL*
have
no
doubt
,
to
my
staring
at
him
.
I
stopped
to
assure
him
that
I
had
*NL*
not
done
so
in
bad
manners
,
but
uncertain
whether
he
might
or
might
not
*NL*
like
a
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wot
job
?
''
said
the
long-legged
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
move
a
box
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wot
box
?
''
said
the
long-legged
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
mine
,
which
was
down
that
street
there
,
and
which
I
wanted
*NL*
him
to
take
to
the
Dover
coach-office
for
sixpence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
with
you
for
a
tanner
!
''
said
the
long-legged
young
man
,
and
*NL*
directly
got
upon
his
cart
,
which
was
nothing
but
a
large
wooden-tray
on
*NL*
wheels
,
and
rattled
away
at
such
a
rate
,
that
it
was
as
much
as
I
could
*NL*
do
to
keep
pace
with
the
donkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
defiant
manner
about
this
young
man
,
and
particularly
about
*NL*
the
way
in
which
he
chewed
straw
as
he
spoke
to
me
,
that
I
did
not
much
*NL*
like
;
as
the
bargain
was
made
,
however
,
I
took
him
up-stairs
to
the
room
*NL*
I
was
leaving
,
and
we
brought
the
box
down
,
and
put
it
on
his
cart
.
Now
,
*NL*
I
was
unwilling
to
put
the
direction-card
on
there
,
lest
any
of
my
*NL*
landlord
's
family
should
fathom
what
I
was
doing
,
and
detain
me
;
so
I
*NL*
said
to
the
young
man
that
I
would
be
glad
if
he
would
stop
for
a
*NL*
minute
,
when
he
came
to
the
dead-wall
of
the
King
's
Bench
prison
.
The
*NL*
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
,
than
he
rattled
away
as
if
he
,
my
*NL*
box
,
the
cart
,
and
the
donkey
,
were
all
equally
mad
;
and
I
was
quite
out
*NL*
of
breath
with
running
and
calling
after
him
,
when
I
caught
him
at
the
*NL*
place
appointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
much
flushed
and
excited
,
I
tumbled
my
half-guinea
out
of
my
*NL*
pocket
in
pulling
the
card
out
.
I
put
it
in
my
mouth
for
safety
,
and
*NL*
though
my
hands
trembled
a
good
deal
,
had
just
tied
the
card
on
very
*NL*
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
when
I
felt
myself
violently
chucked
under
the
*NL*
chin
by
the
long-legged
young
man
,
and
saw
my
half-guinea
fly
out
of
my
*NL*
mouth
into
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wot
!
''
said
the
young
man
,
seizing
me
by
my
jacket
collar
,
with
a
*NL*
frightful
grin
.
``
This
is
a
pollis
case
,
is
it
?
You
're
a
going
to
bolt
,
*NL*
are
you
?
Come
to
the
pollis
,
you
young
warmin
,
come
to
the
pollis
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give
me
my
money
back
,
if
you
please
,
''
said
I
,
very
much
*NL*
frightened
;
``
and
leave
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
the
pollis
!
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
You
shall
prove
it
yourn
to
*NL*
the
pollis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
my
box
and
money
,
will
you
,
''
I
cried
,
bursting
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
still
replied
:
``
Come
to
the
pollis
!
''
and
was
dragging
me
*NL*
against
the
donkey
in
a
violent
manner
,
as
if
there
were
any
affinity
*NL*
between
that
animal
and
a
magistrate
,
when
he
changed
his
mind
,
jumped
*NL*
into
the
cart
,
sat
upon
my
box
,
and
,
exclaiming
that
he
would
drive
to
*NL*
the
pollis
straight
,
rattled
away
harder
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
after
him
as
fast
as
I
could
,
but
I
had
no
breath
to
call
out
*NL*
with
,
and
should
not
have
dared
to
call
out
,
now
,
if
I
had
.
I
narrowly
*NL*
escaped
being
run
over
,
twenty
times
at
least
,
in
half
a
mile
.
Now
I
*NL*
lost
him
,
now
I
saw
him
,
now
I
lost
him
,
now
I
was
cut
at
with
a
whip
,
*NL*
now
shouted
at
,
now
down
in
the
mud
,
now
up
again
,
now
running
into
*NL*
somebody
's
arms
,
now
running
headlong
at
a
post
.
At
length
,
confused
by
*NL*
fright
and
heat
,
and
doubting
whether
half
London
might
not
by
this
time
*NL*
be
turning
out
for
my
apprehension
,
I
left
the
young
man
to
go
where
he
*NL*
would
with
my
box
and
money
;
and
,
panting
and
crying
,
but
never
*NL*
stopping
,
faced
about
for
Greenwich
,
which
I
had
understood
was
on
the
*NL*
Dover
Road
:
taking
very
little
more
out
of
the
world
,
towards
the
*NL*
retreat
of
my
aunt
,
Miss
Betsey
,
than
I
had
brought
into
it
,
on
the
*NL*
night
when
my
arrival
gave
her
so
much
umbrage
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SEQUEL
OF
MY
RESOLUTION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
anything
I
know
,
I
may
have
had
some
wild
idea
of
running
all
the
*NL*
way
to
Dover
,
when
I
gave
up
the
pursuit
of
the
young
man
with
the
*NL*
donkey
cart
,
and
started
for
Greenwich
.
My
scattered
senses
were
soon
*NL*
collected
as
to
that
point
,
if
I
had
;
for
I
came
to
a
stop
in
the
*NL*
Kent
Road
,
at
a
terrace
with
a
piece
of
water
before
it
,
and
a
great
*NL*
foolish
image
in
the
middle
,
blowing
a
dry
shell
.
Here
I
sat
down
on
*NL*
a
door-step
,
quite
spent
and
exhausted
with
the
efforts
I
had
already
*NL*
made
,
and
with
hardly
breath
enough
to
cry
for
the
loss
of
my
box
and
*NL*
half-guinea
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
this
time
dark
;
I
heard
the
clocks
strike
ten
,
as
I
sat
*NL*
resting
.
But
it
was
a
summer
night
,
fortunately
,
and
fine
weather
.
When
*NL*
I
had
recovered
my
breath
,
and
had
got
rid
of
a
stifling
sensation
in
my
*NL*
throat
,
I
rose
up
and
went
on
.
In
the
midst
of
my
distress
,
I
had
no
*NL*
notion
of
going
back
.
I
doubt
if
I
should
have
had
any
,
though
there
had
*NL*
been
a
Swiss
snow-drift
in
the
Kent
Road
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
standing
possessed
of
only
three-halfpence
in
the
world
-LRB-
and
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
wonder
how
_
they
_
came
to
be
left
in
my
pocket
on
a
Saturday
*NL*
night
!
-RRB-
troubled
me
none
the
less
because
I
went
on
.
I
began
to
picture
*NL*
to
myself
,
as
a
scrap
of
newspaper
intelligence
,
my
being
found
dead
in
*NL*
a
day
or
two
,
under
some
hedge
;
and
I
trudged
on
miserably
,
though
as
*NL*
fast
as
I
could
,
until
I
happened
to
pass
a
little
shop
,
where
it
was
*NL*
written
up
that
ladies
'
and
gentlemen
's
wardrobes
were
bought
,
and
that
*NL*
the
best
price
was
given
for
rags
,
bones
,
and
kitchen-stuff
.
The
master
*NL*
of
this
shop
was
sitting
at
the
door
in
his
shirt
sleeves
,
smoking
;
and
*NL*
as
there
were
a
great
many
coats
and
pairs
of
trowsers
dangling
from
the
*NL*
low
ceiling
,
and
only
two
feeble
candles
burning
inside
to
show
what
*NL*
they
were
,
I
fancied
that
he
looked
like
a
man
of
a
revengeful
*NL*
disposition
,
who
had
hung
all
his
enemies
,
and
was
enjoying
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
late
experiences
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
suggested
to
me
that
here
*NL*
might
be
a
means
of
keeping
off
the
wolf
for
a
little
while
.
I
went
up
*NL*
the
next
bye-street
,
took
off
my
waistcoat
,
rolled
it
neatly
under
my
*NL*
arm
,
and
came
back
to
the
shop-door
.
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
am
*NL*
to
sell
this
for
a
fair
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dolloby
--
Dolloby
was
the
name
over
the
shop-door
,
at
least
--
took
the
*NL*
waistcoat
,
stood
his
pipe
on
its
head
against
the
door-post
,
went
into
*NL*
the
shop
,
followed
by
me
,
snuffed
the
two
candles
with
his
fingers
,
*NL*
spread
the
waistcoat
on
the
counter
,
and
looked
at
it
there
,
held
it
up
*NL*
against
the
light
,
and
looked
at
it
there
,
and
ultimately
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
a
price
,
now
,
for
this
here
little
weskit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
know
best
,
sir
,
''
I
returned
,
modestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
buyer
and
seller
too
,
''
said
Mr.
Dolloby
.
``
Put
a
price
on
*NL*
this
here
little
weskit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
eighteenpence
be
''
--
I
hinted
,
after
some
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dolloby
rolled
it
up
again
,
and
gave
it
me
back
.
``
I
should
rob
my
*NL*
family
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
I
was
to
offer
ninepence
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
disagreeable
way
of
putting
the
business
;
because
it
imposed
*NL*
upon
me
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
the
unpleasantness
of
asking
Mr.
Dolloby
to
*NL*
rob
his
family
on
my
account
.
My
circumstances
being
so
very
pressing
,
*NL*
however
,
I
said
I
would
take
ninepence
for
it
,
if
he
pleased
.
Mr.
*NL*
Dolloby
,
not
without
some
grumbling
,
gave
ninepence
.
I
wished
him
good
*NL*
night
,
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
,
the
richer
by
that
sum
,
and
the
*NL*
poorer
by
a
waistcoat
.
But
when
I
buttoned
my
jacket
,
that
was
not
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
foresaw
pretty
clearly
that
my
jacket
would
go
next
,
and
that
*NL*
I
should
have
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
Dover
in
a
shirt
and
a
pair
*NL*
of
trowsers
,
and
might
deem
myself
lucky
if
I
got
there
even
in
that
*NL*
trim
.
But
my
mind
did
not
run
so
much
on
this
as
might
be
supposed
.
*NL*
Beyond
a
general
impression
of
the
distance
before
me
,
and
of
the
young
*NL*
man
with
the
donkey-cart
having
used
me
cruelly
,
I
think
I
had
no
very
*NL*
urgent
sense
of
my
difficulties
when
I
once
again
set
off
with
my
*NL*
ninepence
in
my
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
plan
had
occurred
to
me
for
passing
the
night
,
which
I
was
going
to
*NL*
carry
into
execution
.
This
was
,
to
lie
behind
the
wall
at
the
back
of
my
*NL*
old
school
,
in
a
corner
where
there
used
to
be
a
haystack
.
I
imagined
it
*NL*
would
be
a
kind
of
company
to
have
the
boys
,
and
the
bed-room
where
I
*NL*
used
to
tell
the
stories
,
so
near
me
:
although
the
boys
would
know
*NL*
nothing
of
my
being
there
,
and
the
bed-room
would
yield
me
no
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
had
a
hard
day
's
work
,
and
was
pretty
well
jaded
when
I
came
*NL*
climbing
out
,
at
last
,
upon
the
level
of
Blackheath
.
It
cost
me
some
*NL*
trouble
to
find
out
Salem
House
;
but
I
found
it
,
and
I
found
a
haystack
*NL*
in
the
corner
,
and
I
lay
down
by
it
;
having
first
walked
round
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
,
and
seen
that
all
was
dark
and
silent
*NL*
within
.
Never
shall
I
forget
the
lonely
sensation
of
first
lying
down
,
*NL*
without
a
roof
above
my
head
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sleep
came
upon
me
as
it
came
on
many
other
outcasts
,
against
whom
*NL*
house-doors
were
locked
,
and
house-dogs
barked
,
that
night
--
and
I
*NL*
dreamed
of
lying
on
my
old
school-bed
,
talking
to
the
boys
in
my
room
;
*NL*
and
found
myself
sitting
upright
,
with
Steerforth
's
name
upon
my
lips
,
*NL*
looking
wildly
at
the
stars
that
were
glistening
and
glimmering
above
*NL*
me
.
When
I
remembered
where
I
was
at
that
untimely
hour
,
a
feeling
stole
*NL*
upon
me
that
made
me
get
up
,
afraid
of
I
do
n't
know
what
,
and
walk
*NL*
about
.
But
the
fainter
glimmering
of
the
stars
,
and
the
pale
light
in
*NL*
the
sky
where
the
day
was
coming
,
reassured
me
:
and
my
eyes
being
very
*NL*
heavy
,
I
lay
down
again
,
and
slept
--
though
with
a
knowledge
in
my
sleep
*NL*
that
it
was
cold
--
until
the
warm
beams
of
the
sun
,
and
the
ringing
of
*NL*
the
getting-up
bell
at
Salem
House
,
awoke
me
.
If
I
could
have
hoped
that
*NL*
Steerforth
was
there
,
I
would
have
lurked
about
until
he
came
out
alone
;
*NL*
but
I
knew
he
must
have
left
long
since
.
Traddles
still
remained
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
it
was
very
doubtful
;
and
I
had
not
sufficient
confidence
*NL*
in
his
discretion
or
good
luck
,
however
strong
my
reliance
was
on
his
*NL*
good-nature
,
to
wish
to
trust
him
with
my
situation
.
So
I
crept
away
*NL*
from
the
wall
as
Mr.
Creakle
's
boys
were
getting
up
,
and
struck
into
the
*NL*
long
dusty
track
which
I
had
first
known
to
be
the
Dover
road
when
I
was
*NL*
one
of
them
,
and
when
I
little
expected
that
any
eyes
would
ever
see
me
*NL*
the
wayfarer
I
was
now
,
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
different
Sunday
morning
from
the
old
Sunday
morning
at
Yarmouth
!
*NL*
In
due
time
I
heard
the
church-bells
ringing
,
as
I
plodded
on
;
and
I
met
*NL*
people
who
were
going
to
church
;
and
I
passed
a
church
or
two
where
the
*NL*
congregation
were
inside
,
and
the
sound
of
singing
came
out
into
the
*NL*
sun-shine
,
while
the
beadle
sat
and
cooled
himself
in
the
shade
of
the
*NL*
porch
,
or
stood
beneath
the
yew-tree
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
*NL*
glowering
at
me
going
by
.
But
the
peace
and
rest
of
the
old
Sunday
*NL*
morning
were
on
everything
,
except
me
.
That
was
the
difference
.
I
felt
*NL*
quite
wicked
in
my
dirt
and
dust
,
and
with
my
tangled
hair
.
But
for
the
*NL*
quiet
picture
I
had
conjured
up
,
of
my
mother
in
her
youth
and
beauty
,
*NL*
weeping
by
the
fire
,
and
my
aunt
relenting
to
her
,
I
hardly
think
I
*NL*
should
have
had
courage
to
go
on
until
next
day
.
But
it
always
went
*NL*
before
me
,
and
I
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
,
that
Sunday
,
through
three-and-twenty
miles
on
the
straight
road
,
*NL*
though
not
very
easily
,
for
I
was
new
to
that
kind
of
toil
.
I
see
*NL*
myself
,
as
evening
closes
in
,
coming
over
the
bridge
at
Rochester
,
*NL*
footsore
and
tired
,
and
eating
bread
that
I
had
bought
for
supper
.
One
*NL*
or
two
little
houses
,
with
the
notice
,
``
Lodgings
for
Travellers
,
''
*NL*
hanging
out
,
had
tempted
me
;
but
I
was
afraid
of
spending
the
few
pence
*NL*
I
had
,
and
was
even
more
afraid
of
the
vicious
looks
of
the
trampers
I
*NL*
had
met
or
overtaken
.
I
sought
no
shelter
,
therefore
,
but
the
sky
;
and
*NL*
toiling
into
Chatham
,
--
which
,
in
that
night
's
aspect
,
is
a
mere
dream
of
*NL*
chalk
,
and
drawbridges
,
and
mastless
ships
in
a
muddy
river
,
roofed
like
*NL*
Noah
's
arks
,
--
crept
,
at
last
,
upon
a
sort
of
grass-grown
battery
*NL*
overhanging
a
lane
,
where
a
sentry
was
walking
to
and
fro
.
Here
I
lay
*NL*
down
,
near
a
cannon
;
and
,
happy
in
the
society
of
the
sentry
's
*NL*
footsteps
,
though
he
knew
no
more
of
my
being
above
him
than
the
boys
at
*NL*
Salem
House
had
known
of
my
lying
by
the
wall
,
slept
soundly
until
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
stiff
and
sore
of
foot
I
was
in
the
morning
,
and
quite
dazed
by
the
*NL*
beating
of
drums
and
marching
of
troops
,
which
seemed
to
hem
me
in
on
*NL*
every
side
when
I
went
down
towards
the
long
narrow
street
.
Feeling
that
*NL*
I
could
go
but
a
very
little
way
that
day
,
if
I
were
to
reserve
any
*NL*
strength
for
getting
to
my
journey
's
end
,
I
resolved
to
make
the
sale
of
*NL*
my
jacket
its
principal
business
.
Accordingly
,
I
took
the
jacket
off
,
*NL*
that
I
might
learn
to
do
without
it
;
and
carrying
it
under
my
arm
,
began
*NL*
a
tour
of
inspection
of
the
various
slop-shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
likely
place
to
sell
a
jacket
in
;
for
the
dealers
in
*NL*
second-hand
clothes
were
numerous
,
and
were
,
generally
speaking
,
on
the
*NL*
look-out
for
customers
at
their
shop-doors
.
But
as
most
of
them
had
,
*NL*
hanging
up
among
their
stock
,
an
officer
's
coat
or
two
,
epaulettes
and
*NL*
all
,
I
was
rendered
timid
by
the
costly
nature
of
their
dealings
,
and
*NL*
walked
about
for
a
long
time
without
offering
my
merchandize
to
any
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
modesty
of
mine
directed
my
attention
to
the
marine-store
shops
,
*NL*
and
such
shops
as
Mr.
Dolloby
's
,
in
preference
to
the
regular
dealers
.
*NL*
At
last
I
found
one
that
I
thought
looked
promising
,
at
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
dirty
lane
,
ending
in
an
inclosure
full
of
stinging
nettles
,
against
the
*NL*
palings
of
which
some
second-hand
sailors
'
clothes
,
that
seemed
to
have
*NL*
overflowed
the
shop
,
were
fluttering
among
some
cots
,
and
rusty
guns
,
*NL*
and
oilskin
hats
,
and
certain
trays
full
of
so
many
old
rusty
keys
of
so
*NL*
many
sizes
that
they
seemed
various
enough
to
open
all
the
doors
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
shop
,
which
was
low
and
small
,
and
which
was
darkened
rather
*NL*
than
lighted
by
a
little
window
,
overhung
with
clothes
,
and
was
*NL*
descended
into
by
some
steps
,
I
went
with
a
palpitating
heart
;
which
was
*NL*
not
relieved
when
an
ugly
old
man
,
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
all
*NL*
covered
with
a
stubbly
grey
beard
,
rushed
out
of
a
dirty
den
behind
it
,
*NL*
and
seized
me
by
the
hair
of
my
head
.
He
was
a
dreadful
old
man
to
look
*NL*
at
,
in
a
filthy
flannel
waistcoat
,
and
smelling
terribly
of
rum
.
His
*NL*
bedstead
,
covered
with
a
tumbled
and
ragged
piece
of
patchwork
,
was
in
*NL*
the
den
he
had
come
from
,
where
another
little
window
showed
a
prospect
*NL*
of
more
stinging
nettles
,
and
a
lame
donkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
do
you
want
?
''
grinned
this
old
man
,
in
a
fierce
,
monotonous
*NL*
whine
.
``
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
,
what
do
you
want
?
Oh
,
my
lungs
,
and
*NL*
liver
,
what
do
you
want
?
Oh
,
goroo
,
goroo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
much
dismayed
by
these
words
,
and
particularly
by
the
*NL*
repetition
of
the
last
unknown
one
,
which
was
a
kind
of
rattle
in
his
*NL*
throat
,
that
I
could
make
no
answer
;
hereupon
the
old
man
,
still
holding
*NL*
me
by
the
hair
,
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
do
you
want
?
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
,
what
do
you
want
?
Oh
,
my
*NL*
lungs
and
liver
,
what
do
you
want
!
Oh
,
goroo
!
''
--
which
he
screwed
out
of
*NL*
himself
,
with
an
energy
that
made
his
eyes
start
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
know
,
''
I
said
,
trembling
,
``
if
you
would
buy
a
jacket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
's
see
the
jacket
!
''
cried
the
old
man
.
``
Oh
,
my
heart
on
fire
,
*NL*
show
the
jacket
to
us
!
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
,
bring
the
jacket
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
took
his
trembling
hands
,
which
were
like
the
claws
of
a
*NL*
great
bird
,
out
of
my
hair
;
and
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
not
at
all
*NL*
ornamental
to
his
inflamed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
much
for
the
jacket
?
''
cried
the
old
man
,
after
examining
it
.
*NL*
``
Oh
--
goroo
!
--
how
much
for
the
jacket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-a-crown
,
''
I
answered
,
recovering
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
lungs
and
liver
,
''
cried
the
old
man
,
``
no
!
Oh
,
my
eyes
,
no
!
Oh
,
*NL*
my
limbs
,
no
!
Eighteenpence
.
Goroo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
time
he
uttered
this
ejaculation
,
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
in
danger
*NL*
of
starting
out
;
and
every
sentence
he
spoke
,
he
delivered
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
tune
,
always
exactly
the
same
,
and
more
like
a
gust
of
wind
,
which
*NL*
begins
low
,
mounts
up
high
,
and
falls
again
,
than
any
other
comparison
I
*NL*
can
find
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
glad
to
have
closed
the
bargain
,
``
I
'll
take
*NL*
eighteenpence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
liver
!
''
cried
the
old
man
,
throwing
the
jacket
on
a
shelf
.
``
Get
*NL*
out
of
the
shop
!
Oh
,
my
lungs
,
get
out
of
the
shop
!
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
*NL*
limbs
--
goroo
!
--
do
n't
ask
for
money
;
make
it
an
exchange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
,
before
or
since
;
but
I
told
him
*NL*
humbly
that
I
wanted
money
,
and
that
nothing
else
was
of
any
use
to
me
,
*NL*
but
that
I
would
wait
for
it
,
as
he
desired
,
outside
,
and
had
no
wish
to
*NL*
hurry
him
.
So
I
went
outside
,
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
in
a
corner
.
And
*NL*
I
sat
there
so
many
hours
,
that
the
shade
became
sunlight
,
and
the
*NL*
sunlight
became
shade
again
,
and
still
I
sat
there
waiting
for
the
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
never
was
such
another
drunken
madman
in
that
line
of
business
,
I
*NL*
hope
.
That
he
was
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
enjoyed
the
*NL*
reputation
of
having
sold
himself
to
the
devil
,
I
soon
understood
from
*NL*
the
visits
he
received
from
the
boys
,
who
continually
came
skirmishing
*NL*
about
the
shop
,
shouting
that
legend
,
and
calling
to
him
to
bring
out
*NL*
his
gold
.
``
You
ai
n't
poor
,
you
know
,
Charley
,
as
you
pretend
.
Bring
out
*NL*
your
gold
.
Bring
out
some
of
the
gold
you
sold
yourself
to
the
devil
*NL*
for
.
Come
!
It
's
in
the
lining
of
the
mattress
,
Charley
.
Rip
it
open
and
*NL*
let
's
have
some
!
''
This
,
and
many
offers
to
lend
him
a
knife
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
exasperated
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
whole
day
was
a
*NL*
succession
of
rushes
on
his
part
,
and
flights
on
the
part
of
the
boys
.
*NL*
Sometimes
in
his
rage
he
would
take
me
for
one
of
them
,
and
come
at
me
,
*NL*
mouthing
as
if
he
were
going
to
tear
me
in
pieces
;
then
,
remembering
me
,
*NL*
just
in
time
,
would
dive
into
the
shop
,
and
lie
upon
his
bed
,
as
I
*NL*
thought
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
yelling
in
a
frantic
way
,
to
his
*NL*
own
windy
tune
,
the
Death
of
Nelson
;
with
an
Oh
!
before
every
line
,
and
*NL*
innumerable
Goroos
interspersed
.
As
if
this
were
not
bad
enough
for
me
,
*NL*
the
boys
,
connecting
me
with
the
establishment
,
on
account
of
the
*NL*
patience
and
perseverance
with
which
I
sat
outside
,
half-dressed
,
pelted
*NL*
me
,
and
used
me
very
ill
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
many
attempts
to
induce
me
to
consent
to
an
exchange
;
at
one
*NL*
time
coming
out
with
a
fishing-rod
,
at
another
with
a
fiddle
,
at
another
*NL*
with
a
cocked
hat
,
at
another
with
a
flute
.
But
I
resisted
all
these
*NL*
overtures
,
and
sat
there
in
desperation
;
each
time
asking
him
,
with
*NL*
tears
in
my
eyes
,
for
my
money
or
my
jacket
.
At
last
he
began
to
pay
me
*NL*
in
halfpence
at
a
time
;
and
was
full
two
hours
getting
by
easy
stages
to
*NL*
a
shilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
!
''
he
then
cried
,
peeping
hideously
out
of
the
*NL*
shop
,
after
a
long
pause
,
``
will
you
go
for
twopence
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
,
''
I
said
;
``
I
shall
be
starved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
lungs
and
liver
,
will
you
go
for
threepence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
go
for
nothing
,
if
I
could
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
I
want
the
money
*NL*
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
--
roo
!
''
-LRB-
it
is
really
impossible
to
express
how
he
twisted
this
*NL*
ejaculation
out
of
himself
,
as
he
peeped
round
the
doorpost
at
me
,
*NL*
showing
nothing
but
his
crafty
old
head
-RRB-
;
``
will
you
go
for
fourpence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
faint
and
weary
that
I
closed
with
this
offer
;
and
taking
the
*NL*
money
out
of
his
claw
,
not
without
trembling
,
went
away
more
hungry
and
*NL*
thirsty
than
I
had
ever
been
,
a
little
before
sunset
.
But
at
an
expense
*NL*
of
threepence
I
soon
refreshed
myself
completely
;
and
,
being
in
better
*NL*
spirits
then
,
limped
seven
miles
upon
my
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
bed
at
night
was
under
another
haystack
,
where
I
rested
comfortably
,
*NL*
after
having
washed
my
blistered
feet
in
a
stream
,
and
dressed
them
as
*NL*
well
as
I
was
able
,
with
some
cool
leaves
.
When
I
took
the
road
again
*NL*
next
morning
,
I
found
that
it
lay
through
a
succession
of
hop-grounds
*NL*
and
orchards
.
It
was
sufficiently
late
in
the
year
for
the
orchards
to
*NL*
be
ruddy
with
ripe
apples
;
and
in
a
few
places
the
hop-pickers
were
*NL*
already
at
work
.
I
thought
it
all
extremely
beautiful
,
and
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
to
sleep
among
the
hops
that
night
:
imagining
some
cheerful
*NL*
companionship
in
the
long
perspectives
of
poles
,
with
the
graceful
*NL*
leaves
twining
round
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trampers
were
worse
than
ever
that
day
,
and
inspired
me
with
a
*NL*
dread
that
is
yet
quite
fresh
in
my
mind
.
Some
of
them
were
most
*NL*
ferocious-looking
ruffians
,
who
stared
at
me
as
I
went
by
;
and
*NL*
stopped
,
perhaps
,
and
called
after
me
to
come
back
and
speak
to
them
;
*NL*
and
when
I
took
to
my
heels
,
stoned
me
.
I
recollect
one
young
fellow
--
a
*NL*
tinker
,
I
suppose
,
from
his
wallet
and
brazier
--
who
had
a
woman
with
*NL*
him
,
and
who
faced
about
and
stared
at
me
thus
;
and
then
roared
to
me
*NL*
in
such
a
tremendous
voice
to
come
back
,
that
I
halted
and
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
when
you
're
called
,
''
said
the
tinker
,
``
or
I
'll
rip
your
*NL*
young
body
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
best
to
go
back
.
As
I
drew
nearer
to
them
,
trying
to
*NL*
propitiate
the
tinker
by
my
looks
,
I
observed
that
the
woman
had
a
black
*NL*
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
said
the
tinker
,
griping
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
*NL*
with
his
blackened
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Dover
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
asked
the
tinker
,
giving
his
hand
another
turn
*NL*
in
my
shirt
,
to
hold
me
more
securely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
London
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
lay
are
you
upon
?
''
asked
the
tinker
.
``
Are
you
a
prig
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
no
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
you
,
by
G
--
?
If
you
make
a
brag
of
your
honesty
to
me
,
''
said
the
*NL*
tinker
,
``
I
'll
knock
your
brains
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
disengaged
hand
he
made
a
menace
of
striking
me
,
and
then
*NL*
looked
at
me
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
the
price
of
a
pint
of
beer
about
you
?
''
said
the
tinker
.
*NL*
``
If
you
have
,
out
with
it
,
afore
I
take
it
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
certainly
have
produced
it
,
but
that
I
met
the
woman
's
look
,
*NL*
and
saw
her
very
slightly
shake
her
head
,
and
form
``
No
!
''
with
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
poor
,
''
I
said
,
attempting
to
smile
,
``
and
have
got
no
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
?
''
said
the
tinker
,
looking
so
sternly
at
me
,
that
*NL*
I
almost
feared
he
saw
the
money
in
my
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
I
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
''
said
the
tinker
,
``
by
wearing
my
brother
's
silk
*NL*
hankercher
?
Give
it
over
here
!
''
And
he
had
mine
off
my
neck
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
tossed
it
to
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
as
if
she
thought
this
a
joke
,
*NL*
and
tossing
it
back
to
me
,
nodded
once
,
as
slightly
as
before
,
and
made
*NL*
the
word
``
Go
!
''
with
her
lips
.
Before
I
could
obey
,
however
,
the
tinker
*NL*
seized
the
handkerchief
out
of
my
hand
with
a
roughness
that
threw
me
*NL*
away
like
a
feather
,
and
putting
it
loosely
round
his
own
neck
,
turned
*NL*
upon
the
woman
with
an
oath
,
and
knocked
her
down
.
I
never
shall
forget
*NL*
seeing
her
fall
backward
on
the
hard
road
,
and
lie
there
with
her
bonnet
*NL*
tumbled
off
,
and
her
hair
all
whitened
in
the
dust
;
nor
,
when
I
looked
*NL*
back
from
a
distance
,
seeing
her
sitting
on
the
pathway
,
which
was
a
*NL*
bank
by
the
roadside
,
wiping
the
blood
from
her
face
with
a
corner
of
*NL*
her
shawl
,
while
he
went
on
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
adventure
frightened
me
so
,
that
,
afterwards
,
when
I
saw
any
of
*NL*
these
people
coming
,
I
turned
back
until
I
could
find
a
hiding-place
,
*NL*
where
I
remained
until
they
had
gone
out
of
sight
;
which
happened
so
*NL*
often
,
that
I
was
very
seriously
delayed
.
But
under
this
difficulty
,
as
*NL*
under
all
the
other
difficulties
of
my
journey
,
I
seemed
to
be
sustained
*NL*
and
led
on
by
my
fanciful
picture
of
my
mother
in
her
youth
,
before
I
*NL*
came
into
the
world
.
It
always
kept
me
company
.
It
was
there
,
among
the
*NL*
hops
,
when
I
lay
down
to
sleep
;
it
was
with
me
on
my
waking
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
it
went
before
me
all
day
.
I
have
associated
it
,
ever
since
,
*NL*
with
the
sunny
street
of
Canterbury
,
dozing
as
it
were
in
the
hot
light
;
*NL*
and
with
the
sight
of
its
old
houses
and
gateways
,
and
the
stately
,
grey
*NL*
Cathedral
,
with
the
rooks
sailing
round
the
towers
.
When
I
came
,
at
*NL*
last
,
upon
the
bare
,
wide
downs
near
Dover
,
it
relieved
the
solitary
*NL*
aspect
of
the
scene
with
hope
;
and
not
until
I
reached
that
first
great
*NL*
aim
of
my
journey
,
and
actually
set
foot
in
the
town
itself
,
on
the
*NL*
sixth
day
of
my
flight
,
did
it
desert
me
.
But
then
,
strange
to
say
,
when
*NL*
I
stood
with
my
ragged
shoes
,
and
my
dusty
,
sunburnt
,
half-clothed
*NL*
figure
,
in
the
place
so
long
desired
,
it
seemed
to
vanish
like
a
dream
,
*NL*
and
to
leave
me
helpless
and
dispirited
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
inquired
about
my
aunt
among
the
boatmen
first
,
and
received
various
*NL*
answers
.
One
said
she
lived
in
the
South
Foreland
Light
,
and
had
singed
*NL*
her
whiskers
by
doing
so
;
another
,
that
she
was
made
fast
to
the
great
*NL*
buoy
outside
the
harbor
,
and
could
only
be
visited
at
half-tide
;
a
*NL*
third
,
that
she
was
locked
up
in
Maidstone
Jail
for
child-stealing
;
a
*NL*
fourth
,
that
she
was
seen
to
mount
a
broom
in
the
last
high
wind
,
and
*NL*
make
direct
for
Calais
.
The
fly-drivers
,
among
whom
I
inquired
next
,
*NL*
were
equally
jocose
and
equally
disrespectful
;
and
the
shopkeepers
,
not
*NL*
liking
my
appearance
,
generally
replied
,
without
hearing
what
I
had
to
*NL*
say
,
that
they
had
got
nothing
for
me
.
I
felt
more
miserable
and
*NL*
destitute
than
I
had
done
at
any
period
of
my
running
away
.
My
money
was
*NL*
all
gone
,
I
had
nothing
left
to
dispose
of
;
I
was
hungry
,
thirsty
,
and
*NL*
worn
out
;
and
seemed
as
distant
from
my
end
as
if
I
had
remained
in
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
had
worn
away
in
these
inquiries
,
and
I
was
sitting
on
the
*NL*
step
of
an
empty
shop
at
a
street
corner
,
near
the
market-place
,
*NL*
deliberating
upon
wandering
towards
those
other
places
which
had
been
*NL*
mentioned
,
when
a
fly-driver
,
coming
by
with
his
carriage
,
dropped
a
*NL*
horsecloth
.
Something
good-natured
in
the
man
's
face
,
as
I
handed
it
up
,
*NL*
encouraged
me
to
ask
him
if
he
could
tell
me
where
Miss
Trotwood
lived
;
*NL*
though
I
had
asked
the
question
so
often
,
that
it
almost
died
upon
my
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trotwood
,
''
said
he
.
``
Let
me
see
.
I
know
the
name
,
too
.
Old
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
stiff
in
the
back
?
''
said
he
,
making
himself
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
should
think
it
very
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carries
a
bag
?
''
said
he
--
``
bag
with
a
good
deal
of
room
in
it
--
is
*NL*
gruffish
,
and
comes
down
upon
you
,
sharp
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
sank
within
me
as
I
acknowledged
the
undoubted
accuracy
of
this
*NL*
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
I
tell
you
what
,
''
said
he
.
``
If
you
go
up
there
,
''
pointing
*NL*
with
his
whip
towards
the
heights
,
``
and
keep
right
on
till
you
come
to
*NL*
some
houses
facing
the
sea
,
I
think
you
'll
hear
of
her
.
My
opinion
is
*NL*
she
wo
n't
stand
anything
,
so
here
's
a
penny
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
accepted
the
gift
thankfully
,
and
bought
a
loaf
with
it
.
Dispatching
*NL*
this
refreshment
by
the
way
,
I
went
in
the
direction
my
friend
had
*NL*
indicated
,
and
walked
on
a
good
distance
without
coming
to
the
houses
he
*NL*
had
mentioned
.
At
length
I
saw
some
before
me
;
and
approaching
them
,
*NL*
went
into
a
little
shop
-LRB-
it
was
what
we
used
to
call
a
general
shop
,
at
*NL*
home
-RRB-
,
and
inquired
if
they
could
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
where
*NL*
Miss
Trotwood
lived
.
I
addressed
myself
to
a
man
behind
the
counter
,
who
*NL*
was
weighing
some
rice
for
a
young
woman
;
but
the
latter
,
taking
the
*NL*
inquiry
to
herself
,
turned
round
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
?
''
she
said
.
``
What
do
you
want
with
her
,
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
,
''
I
replied
,
``
to
speak
to
her
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
beg
of
her
,
you
mean
,
''
retorted
the
damsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
``
indeed
.
''
But
suddenly
remembering
that
in
truth
I
came
*NL*
for
no
other
purpose
,
I
held
my
peace
in
confusion
,
and
felt
my
face
*NL*
burn
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
's
handmaid
,
as
I
supposed
she
was
from
what
she
had
said
,
put
*NL*
her
rice
in
a
little
basket
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
;
telling
me
that
*NL*
I
could
follow
her
,
if
I
wanted
to
know
where
Miss
Trotwood
lived
.
I
*NL*
needed
no
second
permission
;
though
I
was
by
this
time
in
such
a
state
*NL*
of
consternation
and
agitation
,
that
my
legs
shook
under
me
.
I
followed
*NL*
the
young
woman
,
and
we
soon
came
to
a
very
neat
little
cottage
with
*NL*
cheerful
bow-windows
:
in
front
of
it
,
a
small
square
gravelled
court
or
*NL*
garden
full
of
flowers
,
carefully
tended
,
and
smelling
deliciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Miss
Trotwood
's
,
''
said
the
young
woman
.
``
Now
you
know
;
and
*NL*
that
's
all
I
have
got
to
say
.
''
With
which
words
she
hurried
into
the
*NL*
house
,
as
if
to
shake
off
the
responsibility
of
my
appearance
;
and
left
*NL*
me
standing
at
the
garden-gate
,
looking
disconsolately
over
the
top
of
*NL*
it
towards
the
parlor-window
,
where
a
muslin
curtain
partly
undrawn
*NL*
in
the
middle
,
a
large
round
green
screen
or
fan
fastened
on
to
the
*NL*
window-sill
,
a
small
table
,
and
a
great
chair
,
suggested
to
me
that
my
*NL*
aunt
might
be
at
that
moment
seated
in
awful
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
shoes
were
by
this
time
in
a
woeful
condition
.
The
soles
had
shed
*NL*
themselves
bit
by
bit
,
and
the
upper
leathers
had
broken
and
burst
until
*NL*
the
very
shape
and
form
of
shoes
had
departed
from
them
.
My
hat
-LRB-
which
*NL*
had
served
me
for
a
night-cap
,
too
-RRB-
was
so
crushed
and
bent
,
that
no
old
*NL*
battered
handle-less
saucepan
on
a
dunghill
need
have
been
ashamed
to
*NL*
vie
with
it
.
My
shirt
and
trowsers
,
stained
with
heat
,
dew
,
grass
,
and
*NL*
the
Kentish
soil
on
which
I
had
slept
--
and
torn
besides
--
might
have
*NL*
frightened
the
birds
from
my
aunt
's
garden
,
as
I
stood
at
the
gate
.
My
*NL*
hair
had
known
no
comb
or
brush
since
I
left
London
.
My
face
,
neck
,
and
*NL*
hands
,
from
unaccustomed
exposure
to
the
air
and
sun
,
were
burnt
to
a
*NL*
berry-brown
.
From
head
to
foot
I
was
powdered
almost
as
white
with
chalk
*NL*
and
dust
,
as
if
I
had
come
out
of
a
lime-kiln
.
In
this
plight
,
and
with
*NL*
a
strong
consciousness
of
it
,
I
waited
to
introduce
myself
to
,
and
make
*NL*
my
first
impression
on
,
my
formidable
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unbroken
stillness
of
the
parlor-window
leading
me
to
infer
,
after
*NL*
a-while
,
that
she
was
not
there
,
I
lifted
up
my
eyes
to
the
window
above
*NL*
it
,
where
I
saw
a
florid
,
pleasant-looking
gentleman
,
with
a
grey
head
,
*NL*
who
shut
up
one
eye
in
a
grotesque
manner
,
nodded
his
head
at
me
several
*NL*
times
,
shook
it
at
me
as
often
,
laughed
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
discomposed
enough
before
;
but
I
was
so
much
the
more
*NL*
discomposed
by
this
unexpected
behaviour
,
that
I
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
slinking
off
,
to
think
how
I
had
best
proceed
,
when
there
came
out
of
*NL*
the
house
a
lady
with
a
handkerchief
tied
over
her
cap
,
and
a
pair
of
*NL*
gardening
gloves
on
her
hands
,
wearing
a
gardening
pocket
like
a
*NL*
tollman
's
apron
,
and
carrying
a
great
knife
.
I
knew
her
immediately
to
*NL*
be
Miss
Betsey
,
for
she
came
stalking
out
of
the
house
exactly
as
my
*NL*
poor
mother
had
so
often
described
her
stalking
up
our
garden
at
*NL*
Blunderstone
Rookery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
''
said
Miss
Betsey
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
making
a
distant
chop
*NL*
in
the
air
with
her
knife
.
``
Go
along
!
No
boys
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
watched
her
,
with
my
heart
at
my
lips
,
as
she
marched
to
a
corner
of
*NL*
her
garden
,
and
stooped
to
dig
up
some
little
root
there
.
Then
,
without
*NL*
a
scrap
of
courage
,
but
with
a
great
deal
of
desperation
,
I
went
softly
*NL*
in
and
stood
beside
her
,
touching
her
with
my
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
''
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
,
and
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
EH
?
''
exclaimed
Miss
Betsey
,
in
a
tone
of
amazement
I
have
never
heard
*NL*
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
aunt
,
I
am
your
nephew
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
And
sat
flat
down
in
the
garden-path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
David
Copperfield
,
of
Blunderstone
,
in
Suffolk
--
where
you
came
,
*NL*
on
the
night
when
I
was
born
,
and
saw
my
dear
mama
.
I
have
been
very
*NL*
unhappy
since
she
died
.
I
have
been
slighted
,
and
taught
nothing
,
and
*NL*
thrown
upon
myself
,
and
put
to
work
not
fit
for
me
.
It
made
me
run
away
*NL*
to
you
.
I
was
robbed
at
first
setting
out
,
and
have
walked
all
the
*NL*
way
,
and
have
never
slept
in
a
bed
since
I
began
the
journey
.
''
Here
my
*NL*
self-support
gave
way
all
at
once
;
and
with
a
movement
of
my
hands
,
*NL*
intended
to
show
her
my
ragged
state
,
and
call
it
to
witness
that
I
had
*NL*
suffered
something
,
I
broke
into
a
passion
of
crying
,
which
I
suppose
*NL*
had
been
pent
up
within
me
all
the
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
with
every
sort
of
expression
but
wonder
discharged
from
her
*NL*
countenance
,
sat
on
the
gravel
,
staring
at
me
,
until
I
began
to
cry
;
*NL*
when
she
got
up
in
a
great
hurry
,
collared
me
,
and
took
me
into
the
*NL*
parlor
.
Her
first
proceeding
there
was
to
unlock
a
tall
press
,
bring
out
*NL*
several
bottles
,
and
pour
some
of
the
contents
of
each
into
my
mouth
.
I
*NL*
think
they
must
have
been
taken
out
at
random
,
for
I
am
sure
I
tasted
*NL*
aniseed
water
,
anchovy
sauce
,
and
salad
dressing
.
When
she
had
*NL*
administered
these
restoratives
,
as
I
was
still
quite
hysterical
,
and
*NL*
unable
to
controul
my
sobs
,
she
put
me
on
the
sofa
,
with
a
shawl
under
*NL*
my
head
,
and
the
handkerchief
from
her
own
head
under
my
feet
,
lest
I
*NL*
should
sully
the
cover
;
and
then
,
sitting
herself
down
behind
the
green
*NL*
fan
or
screen
I
have
already
mentioned
,
so
that
I
could
not
see
her
*NL*
face
,
ejaculated
at
intervals
,
``
Mercy
on
us
!
''
letting
those
exclamations
*NL*
off
like
minute
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
she
rang
the
bell
.
``
Janet
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
when
her
servant
*NL*
came
in
.
``
Go
up
stairs
,
give
my
compliments
to
Mr.
Dick
,
and
say
I
wish
*NL*
to
speak
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Janet
looked
a
little
surprised
to
see
me
lying
stiffly
on
the
sofa
-LRB-
I
*NL*
was
afraid
to
move
lest
it
should
be
displeasing
to
my
aunt
-RRB-
,
but
went
*NL*
on
her
errand
.
My
aunt
,
with
her
hands
behind
her
,
walked
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
,
until
the
gentleman
who
had
squinted
at
me
from
the
upper
*NL*
window
came
in
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dick
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
do
n't
be
a
fool
,
because
nobody
can
be
more
*NL*
discreet
than
you
can
,
when
you
choose
.
We
all
know
that
.
So
do
n't
be
a
*NL*
fool
,
whatever
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
was
serious
immediately
,
and
looked
at
me
,
I
thought
,
as
*NL*
if
he
would
entreat
me
to
say
nothing
about
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dick
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
you
have
heard
me
mention
David
Copperfield
?
*NL*
Now
do
n't
pretend
not
to
have
a
memory
,
because
you
and
I
know
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
who
did
not
appear
to
me
to
remember
*NL*
much
about
it
.
''
_
David
_
Copperfield
?
Oh
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
David
,
*NL*
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
this
is
his
boy
--
his
son
.
He
would
be
as
like
his
*NL*
father
as
it
's
possible
to
be
,
if
he
was
not
so
like
his
mother
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
son
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
David
's
son
?
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
pursued
my
aunt
,
``
and
he
has
done
a
pretty
piece
of
business
.
He
*NL*
has
run
away
.
Ah
!
His
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
never
would
have
run
*NL*
away
.
''
My
aunt
shook
her
head
firmly
,
confident
in
the
character
and
*NL*
behaviour
of
the
girl
who
never
was
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
think
she
would
n't
have
run
away
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
and
save
the
man
,
''
exclaimed
my
aunt
,
sharply
,
``
how
he
talks
!
*NL*
Do
n't
I
know
she
would
n't
?
She
would
have
lived
with
her
god-mother
,
and
*NL*
we
should
have
been
devoted
to
one
another
.
Where
,
in
the
name
of
*NL*
wonder
,
should
his
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
have
run
from
,
or
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowhere
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
softened
by
the
reply
,
``
how
can
you
*NL*
pretend
to
be
wool-gathering
,
Dick
,
when
you
are
as
sharp
as
a
surgeon
's
*NL*
lancet
?
Now
,
here
you
see
young
David
Copperfield
,
and
the
question
I
*NL*
put
to
you
is
,
what
shall
I
do
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
you
do
with
him
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
feebly
,
scratching
his
*NL*
head
.
``
Oh
!
do
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
grave
look
and
her
forefinger
held
up
.
*NL*
``
Come
!
I
want
some
very
sound
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
I
was
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
considering
,
and
looking
vacantly
at
*NL*
me
,
``
I
should
--
''
The
contemplation
of
me
seemed
to
inspire
him
with
a
*NL*
sudden
idea
,
and
he
added
,
briskly
,
``
I
should
wash
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Janet
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
turning
round
with
a
quiet
triumph
,
which
I
did
*NL*
not
then
understand
,
``
Mr.
Dick
sets
us
all
right
.
Heat
the
bath
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
was
deeply
interested
in
this
dialogue
,
I
could
not
help
*NL*
observing
my
aunt
,
Mr.
Dick
,
and
Janet
,
while
it
was
in
progress
,
and
*NL*
completing
a
survey
I
had
already
been
engaged
in
making
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
a
tall
,
hard-featured
lady
,
but
by
no
means
ill-looking
.
*NL*
There
was
an
inflexibility
in
her
face
,
in
her
voice
,
in
her
gait
and
*NL*
carriage
,
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
the
effect
she
had
made
upon
a
*NL*
gentle
creature
like
my
mother
;
but
her
features
were
rather
handsome
*NL*
than
otherwise
,
though
unbending
and
austere
.
I
particularly
noticed
*NL*
that
she
had
a
very
quick
,
bright
eye
.
Her
hair
,
which
was
grey
,
was
*NL*
arranged
in
two
plain
divisions
,
under
what
I
believe
would
be
called
a
*NL*
mob-cap
:
I
mean
a
cap
,
much
more
common
then
than
now
,
with
side-pieces
*NL*
fastening
under
the
chin
.
Her
dress
was
of
a
lavender
color
,
and
*NL*
perfectly
neat
;
but
scantily
made
,
as
if
she
desired
to
be
as
little
*NL*
encumbered
as
possible
.
I
remember
that
I
thought
it
,
in
form
,
more
like
*NL*
a
riding-habit
with
the
superfluous
skirt
cut
off
,
than
anything
else
.
*NL*
She
wore
at
her
side
a
gentleman
's
gold
watch
,
if
I
might
judge
from
its
*NL*
size
and
make
,
with
an
appropriate
chain
and
seals
;
she
had
some
linen
*NL*
at
her
throat
not
unlike
a
shirt-collar
,
and
things
at
her
wrists
like
*NL*
little
shirt-wristbands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
was
grey-headed
,
and
florid
:
I
should
*NL*
have
said
all
about
him
,
in
saying
so
,
had
not
his
head
been
curiously
*NL*
bowed
--
not
by
age
;
it
reminded
me
of
one
of
Mr.
Creakle
's
boys
'
heads
*NL*
after
a
beating
--
and
his
grey
eyes
prominent
and
large
,
with
a
strange
*NL*
kind
of
watery
brightness
in
them
that
made
me
,
in
combination
with
his
*NL*
vacant
manner
,
his
submission
to
my
aunt
,
and
his
childish
delight
when
*NL*
she
praised
him
,
suspect
him
of
being
a
little
mad
;
though
,
if
he
were
*NL*
mad
,
how
he
came
to
be
there
puzzled
me
extremely
.
He
was
dressed
like
*NL*
any
other
ordinary
gentleman
,
in
a
loose
grey
morning
coat
and
*NL*
waistcoat
,
and
white
trowsers
;
and
had
his
watch
in
his
fob
,
and
his
*NL*
money
in
his
pockets
:
which
he
rattled
as
if
he
were
very
proud
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Janet
was
a
pretty
blooming
girl
,
of
about
nineteen
or
twenty
,
and
a
*NL*
perfect
picture
of
neatness
.
Though
I
made
no
further
observation
of
her
*NL*
at
the
moment
,
I
may
mention
here
what
I
did
not
discover
until
*NL*
afterwards
,
namely
,
that
she
was
one
of
a
series
of
protegees
whom
my
*NL*
aunt
had
taken
into
her
service
expressly
to
educate
in
a
renouncement
*NL*
of
mankind
,
and
who
had
generally
completed
their
abjuration
by
marrying
*NL*
the
baker
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
as
neat
as
Janet
or
my
aunt
.
As
I
laid
down
my
pen
,
*NL*
a
moment
since
,
to
think
of
it
,
the
air
from
the
sea
came
blowing
*NL*
in
again
,
mixed
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
;
and
I
saw
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
furniture
brightly
rubbed
and
polished
,
my
aunt
's
*NL*
inviolable
chair
and
table
by
the
round
green
fan
in
the
bow-window
,
*NL*
the
drugget-covered
carpet
,
the
cat
,
the
kettle-holder
,
the
two
*NL*
canaries
,
the
old
china
,
the
punch-bowl
full
of
dried
rose
leaves
,
the
*NL*
tall
press
guarding
all
sorts
of
bottles
and
pots
,
and
,
wonderfully
out
*NL*
of
keeping
with
the
rest
,
my
dusty
self
upon
the
sofa
,
taking
note
of
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Janet
had
gone
away
to
get
the
bath
ready
,
when
my
aunt
,
to
my
great
*NL*
alarm
,
became
in
one
moment
rigid
with
indignation
,
and
had
hardly
voice
*NL*
to
cry
out
,
``
Janet
!
Donkies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
which
,
Janet
came
running
up
the
stairs
as
if
the
house
were
in
*NL*
flames
,
darted
out
on
a
little
piece
of
green
in
front
,
and
warned
off
*NL*
two
saddle-donkeys
,
lady-ridden
,
that
had
presumed
to
set
hoof
upon
it
;
*NL*
while
my
aunt
,
rushing
out
of
the
house
,
seized
the
bridle
of
a
third
*NL*
animal
laden
with
a
bestriding
child
,
turned
him
,
led
him
forth
from
*NL*
those
sacred
precincts
,
and
boxed
the
ears
of
the
unlucky
urchin
in
*NL*
attendance
who
had
dared
to
profane
that
hallowed
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
hour
I
do
n't
know
whether
my
aunt
had
any
lawful
right
of
way
*NL*
over
that
patch
of
green
;
but
she
had
settled
it
in
her
own
mind
that
*NL*
she
had
,
and
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
.
The
one
great
outrage
of
her
*NL*
life
,
demanding
to
be
constantly
avenged
,
was
the
passage
of
a
donkey
*NL*
over
that
immaculate
spot
.
In
whatever
occupation
she
was
engaged
,
*NL*
however
interesting
to
her
the
conversation
in
which
she
was
taking
*NL*
part
,
a
donkey
turned
the
current
of
her
ideas
in
a
moment
,
and
she
*NL*
was
upon
him
straight
.
Jugs
of
water
,
and
watering
pots
,
were
kept
in
*NL*
secret
places
ready
to
be
discharged
on
the
offending
boys
;
sticks
*NL*
were
laid
in
ambush
behind
the
door
;
sallies
were
made
at
all
hours
;
*NL*
and
incessant
war
prevailed
.
Perhaps
this
was
an
agreeable
excitement
*NL*
to
the
donkey-boys
;
or
perhaps
the
more
sagacious
of
the
donkeys
,
*NL*
understanding
how
the
case
stood
,
delighted
with
constitutional
*NL*
obstinacy
in
coming
that
way
.
I
only
know
that
there
were
three
alarms
*NL*
before
the
bath
was
ready
;
and
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
and
*NL*
most
desperate
of
all
,
I
saw
my
aunt
engage
,
single-handed
,
with
a
*NL*
sandy-headed
lad
of
fifteen
,
and
bump
his
sandy
head
against
her
*NL*
own
gate
,
before
he
seemed
to
comprehend
what
was
the
matter
.
These
*NL*
interruptions
were
the
more
ridiculous
to
me
,
because
she
was
giving
me
*NL*
broth
out
of
a
table-spoon
at
the
time
-LRB-
having
firmly
persuaded
herself
*NL*
that
I
was
actually
starving
,
and
must
receive
nourishment
at
first
in
*NL*
very
small
quantities
-RRB-
,
and
,
while
my
mouth
was
yet
open
to
receive
the
*NL*
spoon
,
she
would
put
it
back
into
the
basin
,
cry
``
Janet
!
Donkies
!
''
and
*NL*
go
out
to
the
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bath
was
a
great
comfort
.
For
I
began
to
be
sensible
of
acute
pains
*NL*
in
my
limbs
from
lying
out
in
the
fields
,
and
was
now
so
tired
and
low
*NL*
that
I
could
hardly
keep
myself
awake
for
five
minutes
together
.
When
I
*NL*
had
bathed
,
they
-LRB-
I
mean
my
aunt
and
Janet
-RRB-
enrobed
me
in
a
shirt
and
a
*NL*
pair
of
trowsers
belonging
to
Mr.
Dick
,
and
tied
me
up
in
two
or
three
*NL*
great
shawls
.
What
sort
of
bundle
I
looked
like
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
*NL*
felt
a
very
hot
one
.
Feeling
also
very
faint
and
drowsy
,
I
soon
lay
down
*NL*
on
the
sofa
again
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
a
dream
,
originating
in
the
fancy
which
had
occupied
*NL*
my
mind
so
long
,
but
I
awoke
with
the
impression
that
my
aunt
had
come
*NL*
and
bent
over
me
,
and
had
put
my
hair
away
from
my
face
,
and
laid
my
*NL*
head
more
comfortably
,
and
had
then
stood
looking
at
me
.
The
words
,
*NL*
``
Pretty
fellow
,
''
or
``
Poor
fellow
,
''
seemed
to
be
in
my
ears
,
too
;
but
*NL*
certainly
there
was
nothing
else
,
when
I
awoke
,
to
lead
me
to
believe
*NL*
that
they
had
been
uttered
by
my
aunt
,
who
sat
in
the
bow-window
gazing
*NL*
at
the
sea
from
behind
the
green
fan
,
which
was
mounted
on
a
kind
of
*NL*
swivel
,
and
turned
any
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
dined
soon
after
I
awoke
,
off
a
roast
fowl
and
a
pudding
;
I
sitting
*NL*
at
table
,
not
unlike
a
trussed
bird
myself
,
and
moving
my
arms
with
*NL*
considerable
difficulty
.
But
as
my
aunt
had
swathed
me
up
,
I
made
no
*NL*
complaint
of
being
inconvenienced
.
All
this
time
,
I
was
deeply
anxious
*NL*
to
know
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
me
;
but
she
took
her
dinner
in
*NL*
profound
silence
,
except
when
she
occasionally
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
*NL*
sitting
opposite
,
and
said
,
``
Mercy
upon
us
!
''
which
did
not
by
any
means
*NL*
relieve
my
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cloth
being
drawn
,
and
some
sherry
put
upon
the
table
-LRB-
of
which
I
*NL*
had
a
glass
-RRB-
,
my
aunt
sent
up
for
Mr.
Dick
again
,
who
joined
us
,
and
*NL*
looked
as
wise
as
he
could
when
she
requested
him
to
attend
to
my
story
,
*NL*
which
she
elicited
from
me
,
gradually
,
by
a
course
of
questions
.
During
*NL*
my
recital
,
she
kept
her
eyes
on
Mr.
Dick
,
who
I
thought
would
have
gone
*NL*
to
sleep
but
for
that
,
and
who
,
whensoever
he
lapsed
into
a
smile
,
was
*NL*
checked
by
a
frown
from
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
possessed
that
poor
unfortunate
Baby
,
that
she
must
go
and
be
*NL*
married
again
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
when
I
had
finished
,
''
_
I
_
ca
n't
conceive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
fell
in
love
with
her
second
husband
,
''
Mr.
Dick
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fell
in
love
!
''
repeated
my
aunt
,
``
What
do
you
mean
?
What
business
had
*NL*
she
to
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
Mr.
Dick
simpered
,
after
thinking
a
little
,
``
she
did
it
for
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasure
,
indeed
!
''
replied
my
aunt
.
``
A
mighty
pleasure
for
the
poor
*NL*
baby
to
fix
her
simple
faith
upon
any
dog
of
a
fellow
,
certain
to
*NL*
ill-use
her
in
some
way
or
other
.
What
did
she
propose
to
herself
,
*NL*
I
should
like
to
know
!
She
had
had
one
husband
.
She
had
seen
David
*NL*
Copperfield
out
of
the
world
,
who
was
always
running
after
wax
dolls
*NL*
from
his
cradle
.
She
had
got
a
baby
--
oh
,
there
were
a
pair
of
babies
*NL*
when
she
gave
birth
to
this
child
sitting
here
,
that
Friday
night
!
--
and
*NL*
what
more
did
she
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
secretly
shook
his
head
at
me
,
as
if
he
thought
there
was
no
*NL*
getting
over
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
even
have
a
baby
like
anybody
else
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
Where
*NL*
was
this
child
's
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
!
Not
forthcoming
.
Do
n't
tell
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
seemed
quite
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
man
of
a
doctor
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
*NL*
``
Jellips
,
or
whatever
his
name
was
,
what
was
_
he
_
about
?
All
he
could
*NL*
do
,
was
to
say
to
me
,
like
a
robin
redbreast
--
as
he
_
is
_
--
`
It
's
a
boy
.
'
*NL*
A
boy
!
Yah
,
the
imbecility
of
the
whole
set
of
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
heartiness
of
the
ejaculation
startled
Mr.
Dick
exceedingly
;
and
me
,
*NL*
too
,
if
I
am
to
tell
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
as
if
this
was
not
enough
,
and
she
had
not
stood
sufficiently
*NL*
in
the
light
of
this
child
's
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
*NL*
``
she
marries
a
second
time
--
goes
and
marries
a
Murderer
--
or
a
man
with
a
*NL*
name
like
it
--
and
stands
in
_
this
_
child
's
light
!
And
the
natural
*NL*
consequence
is
,
as
anybody
but
a
baby
might
have
foreseen
,
that
he
*NL*
prowls
and
wanders
.
He
's
as
like
Cain
before
he
was
grown
up
,
as
he
can
*NL*
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
looked
hard
at
me
,
as
if
to
identify
me
in
this
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
there
's
that
woman
with
the
Pagan
name
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
that
*NL*
Peggotty
,
_
she
_
goes
and
gets
married
next
.
Because
she
has
not
seen
*NL*
enough
of
the
evil
attending
such
things
,
_
she
_
goes
and
gets
married
*NL*
next
,
as
the
child
relates
.
I
only
hope
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
*NL*
head
,
``
that
her
husband
is
one
of
those
Poker
husbands
who
abound
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
,
and
will
beat
her
well
with
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
my
old
nurse
so
decried
,
and
made
the
subject
*NL*
of
such
a
wish
.
I
told
my
aunt
that
indeed
she
was
mistaken
.
That
*NL*
Peggotty
was
the
best
,
the
truest
,
the
most
faithful
,
most
devoted
,
and
*NL*
most
self-denying
friend
and
servant
in
the
world
;
who
had
ever
loved
me
*NL*
dearly
,
who
had
ever
loved
my
mother
dearly
;
who
had
held
my
mother
's
*NL*
dying
head
upon
her
arm
,
on
whose
face
my
mother
had
imprinted
her
last
*NL*
grateful
kiss
.
And
my
remembrance
of
them
both
,
choking
me
,
I
broke
down
*NL*
as
I
was
trying
to
say
that
her
home
was
my
home
,
and
that
all
she
had
*NL*
was
mine
,
and
that
I
would
have
gone
to
her
for
shelter
,
but
for
her
*NL*
humble
station
,
which
made
me
fear
that
I
might
bring
some
trouble
on
*NL*
her
--
I
broke
down
,
I
say
,
as
I
was
trying
to
say
so
,
and
laid
my
face
in
*NL*
my
hands
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
the
child
is
right
to
stand
by
those
who
*NL*
have
stood
by
him
--
Janet
!
Donkies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thoroughly
believe
that
but
for
those
unfortunate
donkies
,
we
should
*NL*
have
come
to
a
good
understanding
;
for
my
aunt
had
laid
her
hand
on
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
the
impulse
was
upon
me
,
thus
emboldened
,
to
embrace
her
*NL*
and
beseech
her
protection
.
But
the
interruption
,
and
the
disorder
she
*NL*
was
thrown
into
by
the
struggle
outside
,
put
an
end
to
all
softer
ideas
*NL*
for
the
present
;
and
kept
my
aunt
indignantly
declaiming
to
Mr.
Dick
*NL*
about
her
determination
to
appeal
for
redress
to
the
laws
of
her
*NL*
country
,
and
to
bring
actions
for
trespass
against
the
whole
donkey
*NL*
proprietorship
of
Dover
,
until
tea-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
we
sat
at
the
window
--
on
the
look-out
,
as
I
imagined
,
from
my
*NL*
aunt
's
sharp
expression
of
face
,
for
more
invaders
--
until
dusk
,
when
*NL*
Janet
set
candles
,
and
a
backgammon-board
,
on
the
table
,
and
pulled
down
*NL*
the
blinds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
Dick
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
her
grave
look
,
and
her
forefinger
*NL*
up
as
before
,
``
I
am
going
to
ask
you
another
question
.
Look
at
this
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
's
son
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
with
an
attentive
,
puzzled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
,
''
returned
my
aunt
.
``
What
would
you
do
with
him
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
with
David
's
son
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
replied
my
aunt
,
``
with
David
's
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
Yes
.
Do
with
--
I
should
put
him
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Janet
!
''
cried
my
aunt
,
with
the
same
complacent
triumph
that
I
had
*NL*
remarked
before
.
``
Mr.
Dick
sets
us
all
right
.
If
the
bed
is
ready
,
we
'll
*NL*
take
him
up
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Janet
reporting
it
to
be
quite
ready
,
I
was
taken
up
to
it
;
kindly
,
but
*NL*
in
some
sort
like
a
prisoner
;
my
aunt
going
in
front
and
Janet
bringing
*NL*
up
the
rear
.
The
only
circumstance
which
gave
me
any
new
hope
,
was
my
*NL*
aunt
's
stopping
on
the
stairs
to
inquire
about
a
smell
of
fire
that
was
*NL*
prevalent
there
;
and
Janet
's
replying
that
she
had
been
making
tinder
*NL*
down
in
the
kitchen
,
of
my
old
shirt
.
But
there
were
no
other
clothes
in
*NL*
my
room
than
the
odd
heap
of
things
I
wore
;
and
when
I
was
left
there
,
*NL*
with
a
little
taper
which
my
aunt
forewarned
me
would
burn
exactly
five
*NL*
minutes
,
I
heard
them
lock
my
door
on
the
outside
.
Turning
these
things
*NL*
over
in
my
mind
,
I
deemed
it
possible
that
my
aunt
,
who
could
know
*NL*
nothing
of
me
,
might
suspect
I
had
a
habit
of
running
away
,
and
took
*NL*
precautions
,
on
that
account
,
to
have
me
in
safe
keeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
a
pleasant
one
,
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
overlooking
the
*NL*
sea
,
on
which
the
moon
was
shining
brilliantly
.
After
I
had
said
my
*NL*
prayers
,
and
the
candle
had
burnt
out
,
I
remember
how
I
still
sat
*NL*
looking
at
the
moonlight
on
the
water
,
as
if
I
could
hope
to
read
my
*NL*
fortune
in
it
,
as
in
a
bright
book
;
or
to
see
my
mother
with
her
child
,
*NL*
coming
from
Heaven
,
along
that
shining
path
,
to
look
upon
me
as
she
had
*NL*
looked
when
I
last
saw
her
sweet
face
.
I
remember
how
the
solemn
feeling
*NL*
with
which
at
length
I
turned
my
eyes
away
,
yielded
to
the
sensation
of
*NL*
gratitude
and
rest
which
the
sight
of
the
white-curtained
bed
--
and
how
*NL*
much
more
the
lying
softly
down
upon
it
,
nestling
in
the
snow-white
*NL*
sheets
!
--
inspired
.
I
remember
how
I
thought
of
all
the
solitary
places
*NL*
under
the
night
sky
where
I
had
slept
,
and
how
I
prayed
that
I
never
*NL*
might
be
houseless
any
more
,
and
never
might
forget
the
houseless
.
I
*NL*
remember
how
I
seemed
to
float
,
then
,
down
the
melancholy
glory
of
that
*NL*
track
upon
the
sea
,
away
into
the
world
of
dreams
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
MY
AUNT
MAKES
UP
HER
MIND
ABOUT
ME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
going
down
in
the
morning
,
I
found
my
aunt
musing
so
profoundly
over
*NL*
the
breakfast-table
,
with
her
elbow
on
the
tray
,
that
the
contents
of
*NL*
the
urn
had
overflowed
the
teapot
and
were
laying
the
whole
table-cloth
*NL*
under
water
,
when
my
entrance
put
her
meditations
to
flight
.
I
felt
sure
*NL*
that
I
had
been
the
subject
of
her
reflections
,
and
was
more
than
ever
*NL*
anxious
to
know
her
intentions
towards
me
.
Yet
I
dared
not
express
my
*NL*
anxiety
,
lest
it
should
give
her
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
eyes
,
however
,
not
being
so
much
under
controul
as
my
tongue
,
were
*NL*
attracted
towards
my
aunt
very
often
during
breakfast
.
I
never
could
*NL*
look
at
her
for
a
few
moments
together
but
I
found
her
looking
at
me
--
in
*NL*
an
odd
thoughtful
manner
,
as
if
I
were
an
immense
way
off
,
instead
of
*NL*
being
on
the
other
side
of
the
small
round
table
.
When
she
had
finished
*NL*
her
breakfast
,
my
aunt
very
deliberately
leaned
back
in
her
chair
,
*NL*
knitted
her
brows
,
folded
her
arms
,
and
contemplated
me
at
her
leisure
,
*NL*
with
such
a
fixedness
of
attention
that
I
was
quite
overpowered
by
*NL*
embarrassment
.
Not
having
as
yet
finished
my
own
breakfast
,
I
attempted
*NL*
to
hide
my
confusion
by
proceeding
with
it
;
but
my
knife
tumbled
over
my
*NL*
fork
,
my
fork
tripped
up
my
knife
,
I
chipped
bits
of
bacon
a
surprising
*NL*
height
into
the
air
instead
of
cutting
them
for
my
own
eating
,
and
*NL*
choked
myself
with
my
tea
which
persisted
in
going
the
wrong
way
instead
*NL*
of
the
right
one
,
until
I
gave
in
altogether
,
and
sat
blushing
under
my
*NL*
aunt
's
close
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
after
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
up
,
and
met
her
sharp
bright
glance
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
written
to
him
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
your
father-in-law
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
have
sent
him
a
letter
that
*NL*
I
'll
trouble
him
to
attend
to
,
or
he
and
I
will
fall
out
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
know
where
I
am
,
aunt
?
''
I
inquired
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
him
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
--
be
--
given
up
to
him
?
''
I
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
We
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
ca
n't
think
what
I
shall
do
,
''
I
exclaimed
,
``
if
I
have
to
go
back
*NL*
to
Mr.
Murdstone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
,
I
am
sure
.
We
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
spirits
sank
under
these
words
,
and
I
became
very
downcast
and
heavy
*NL*
of
heart
.
My
aunt
,
without
appearing
to
take
much
heed
of
me
,
put
on
a
*NL*
coarse
apron
with
a
bib
,
which
she
took
out
of
the
press
;
washed
up
the
*NL*
teacups
with
her
own
hands
;
and
,
when
everything
was
washed
and
set
in
*NL*
the
tray
again
,
and
the
cloth
folded
and
put
on
the
top
of
the
whole
,
*NL*
rang
for
Janet
to
remove
it
.
She
next
swept
up
the
crumbs
with
a
little
*NL*
broom
-LRB-
putting
on
a
pair
of
gloves
first
-RRB-
,
until
there
did
not
appear
to
*NL*
be
one
microscopic
speck
left
on
the
carpet
;
next
dusted
and
arranged
*NL*
the
room
,
which
was
dusted
and
arranged
to
a
hair
's
breadth
already
.
*NL*
When
all
these
tasks
were
performed
to
her
satisfaction
,
she
took
off
*NL*
the
gloves
and
apron
,
folded
them
up
,
put
them
in
the
particular
corner
*NL*
of
the
press
from
which
they
had
been
taken
,
brought
out
her
work-box
to
*NL*
her
own
table
in
the
open
window
,
and
sat
down
,
with
the
green
fan
*NL*
between
her
and
the
light
,
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
go
up
stairs
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
as
she
threaded
her
needle
,
*NL*
``
and
give
my
compliments
to
Mr.
Dick
,
and
I
'll
be
glad
to
know
how
he
*NL*
gets
on
with
his
Memorial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
with
all
alacrity
,
to
acquit
myself
of
this
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
eyeing
me
as
narrowly
as
she
had
eyed
the
*NL*
needle
in
threading
it
,
``
you
think
Mr.
Dick
a
short
name
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
rather
a
short
name
,
yesterday
,
''
I
confessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
to
suppose
that
he
has
n't
got
a
longer
name
,
if
he
chose
*NL*
to
use
it
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
loftier
air
.
``
Babley
--
Mr.
Richard
*NL*
Babley
--
that
's
the
gentleman
's
true
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
suggest
,
with
a
modest
sense
of
my
youth
and
the
*NL*
familiarity
I
had
been
already
guilty
of
,
that
I
had
better
give
him
the
*NL*
full
benefit
of
that
name
,
when
my
aunt
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
you
call
him
by
it
,
whatever
you
do
.
He
ca
n't
bear
his
name

*NL*
That
's
a
peculiarity
of
his
.
Though
I
do
n't
know
that
it
's
much
of
a
*NL*
peculiarity
,
either
;
for
he
has
been
ill-used
enough
,
by
some
that
bear
*NL*
it
,
to
have
a
mortal
antipathy
for
it
,
Heaven
knows
.
Mr.
Dick
is
his
*NL*
name
here
,
and
everywhere
else
,
now
--
if
he
ever
went
anywhere
else
,
*NL*
which
he
do
n't
.
So
take
care
,
child
,
you
do
n't
call
him
anything
_
but
_
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
promised
to
obey
,
and
went
up-stairs
with
my
message
;
thinking
,
as
I
*NL*
went
,
that
if
Mr.
Dick
had
been
working
at
his
Memorial
long
,
at
the
*NL*
same
rate
as
I
had
seen
him
working
at
it
,
through
the
open
door
,
when
I
*NL*
came
down
,
he
was
probably
getting
on
very
well
indeed
.
I
found
him
*NL*
still
driving
at
it
with
a
long
pen
,
and
his
head
almost
laid
upon
the
*NL*
paper
.
He
was
so
intent
upon
it
,
that
I
had
ample
leisure
to
observe
the
*NL*
large
paper
kite
in
a
corner
,
the
confusion
of
bundles
of
manuscript
,
*NL*
the
number
of
pens
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
quantity
of
ink
-LRB-
which
he
seemed
*NL*
to
have
in
,
in
half-gallon
jars
by
the
dozen
-RRB-
,
before
he
observed
my
*NL*
being
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
Phoebus
!
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
laying
down
his
pen
.
``
How
does
the
world
*NL*
go
!
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
``
I
should
n't
wish
it
*NL*
to
be
mentioned
,
but
it
's
a

''
here
he
beckoned
to
me
,
and
put
his
lips
*NL*
close
to
my
ear
--
``
it
's
a
mad
world
.
Mad
as
Bedlam
,
boy
!
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
*NL*
taking
snuff
from
a
round
box
on
the
table
,
and
laughing
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
presuming
to
give
my
opinion
on
this
question
,
I
delivered
my
*NL*
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
in
answer
,
``
my
compliments
to
her
,
and
I
--
I
*NL*
believe
I
have
made
a
start
.
I
think
I
have
made
a
start
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
,
passing
his
hand
among
his
grey
hair
,
and
casting
anything
but
a
*NL*
confident
look
at
his
manuscript
.
``
You
have
been
to
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
I
answered
;
``
for
a
short
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
recollect
the
date
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
looking
earnestly
at
me
,
and
*NL*
taking
up
his
pen
to
note
it
down
,
``
when
King
Charles
the
First
had
his
*NL*
head
cut
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
believed
it
happened
in
the
year
sixteen
hundred
and
*NL*
forty-nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returned
Mr.
Dick
,
scratching
his
ear
with
his
pen
,
and
looking
*NL*
dubiously
at
me
.
``
So
the
books
say
;
but
I
do
n't
see
how
that
can
be
.
*NL*
Because
,
if
it
was
so
long
ago
,
how
could
the
people
about
him
have
made
*NL*
that
mistake
of
putting
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
_
his
_
head
,
after
it
*NL*
was
taken
off
,
into
_
mine
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
surprised
by
the
inquiry
;
but
could
give
no
information
*NL*
on
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
strange
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
with
a
despondent
look
upon
his
*NL*
papers
,
and
with
his
hand
among
his
hair
again
,
``
that
I
never
can
get
*NL*
that
quite
right
.
I
never
can
make
that
perfectly
clear
.
But
no
matter
,
*NL*
no
matter
!
''
he
said
cheerfully
,
and
rousing
himself
,
``
there
's
time
*NL*
enough
!
My
compliments
to
Miss
Trotwood
,
I
am
getting
on
very
well
*NL*
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
away
,
when
he
directed
my
attention
to
the
kite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
kite
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
that
it
was
a
beautiful
one
.
I
should
think
it
must
have
been
*NL*
as
much
as
seven
feet
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
it
.
We
'll
go
and
fly
it
,
you
and
I
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
Do
you
see
*NL*
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
me
that
it
was
covered
with
manuscript
,
very
closely
and
*NL*
laboriously
written
;
but
so
plainly
,
that
as
I
looked
along
the
lines
,
I
*NL*
thought
I
saw
some
allusion
to
King
Charles
the
First
's
head
again
,
in
*NL*
one
or
two
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
plenty
of
string
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
and
when
it
flies
high
,
it
*NL*
takes
the
facts
a
long
way
.
That
's
my
manner
of
diffusing
'em
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
where
they
may
come
down
.
It
's
according
to
circumstances
,
and
the
*NL*
wind
,
and
so
forth
;
but
I
take
my
chance
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
so
very
mild
and
pleasant
,
and
had
something
so
reverend
in
*NL*
it
,
though
it
was
hale
and
hearty
,
that
I
was
not
sure
but
that
he
was
*NL*
having
a
good-humoured
jest
with
me
.
So
I
laughed
,
and
he
laughed
,
and
*NL*
we
parted
the
best
friends
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
child
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
when
I
went
down
stairs
.
``
And
what
of
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
,
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
informed
her
that
he
sent
his
compliments
,
and
was
getting
on
very
*NL*
well
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
some
shadowy
idea
of
endeavouring
to
evade
the
question
,
by
*NL*
replying
that
I
thought
him
a
very
nice
gentleman
;
but
my
aunt
was
not
*NL*
to
be
so
put
off
,
for
she
laid
her
work
down
in
her
lap
,
and
said
,
*NL*
folding
her
hands
upon
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Your
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
would
have
told
me
what
she
thought

of
any

Be
as
like
your
sister
as
you
can
,
and
speak
out
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he

is
Mr.

I
ask
because
I
do
n't
know

aunt

is
he
at
all
out
*NL*
of
his
mind
,
then
?

I
stammered
;
for
I
felt
I
was
on
dangerous
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
morsel
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
I
observed
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
anything
in
the
world
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
great
decision
*NL*
and
force
of
manner
,
``
that
Mr.
Dick
is
not
,
it
's
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
nothing
better
to
offer
,
than
another
timid
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
_
called
_
mad
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
have
a
selfish
pleasure
in
*NL*
saying
he
has
been
called
mad
,
or
I
should
not
have
had
the
benefit
of
*NL*
his
society
and
advice
for
these
last
ten
years
and
upwards
--
in
fact
,
*NL*
ever
since
your
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
disappointed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
that
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
nice
people
they
were
,
who
had
the
audacity
to
call
him
mad
,
''
*NL*
pursued
my
aunt
.
``
Mr.
Dick
is
a
sort
of
distant
connexion
of
mine

it
*NL*
does
n't
matter
how

I
need
n't
enter
into
that
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
me
,
*NL*
his
own
brother
would
have
shut
him
up
for
life
.
That
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
afraid
it
was
hypocritical
in
me
,
but
seeing
that
my
aunt
felt
*NL*
strongly
on
the
subject
,
I
tried
to
look
as
if
I
felt
strongly
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
proud
fool
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
Because
his
brother
was
a
little
*NL*
eccentric
--
though
he
is
not
half
so
eccentric
as
a
good
many
people
--
he
*NL*
did
n't
like
to
have
him
visible
about
his
house
,
and
sent
him
away
to
*NL*
some
private
asylum-place
;
though
he
had
been
left
to
his
particular
*NL*
care
by
their
deceased
father
,
who
thought
him
almost
a
natural
.
And
a
*NL*
wise
man
_
he
_
must
have
been
to
think
so

Mad
himself

no

*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
as
my
aunt
looked
quite
convinced
,
I
endeavoured
to
look
quite
*NL*
convinced
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
stepped
in

said
my
aunt
,
``
and
made
him
an
offer

I
said

than
you

be
hoped

Let
him
have
his
little
income
,
and
come
and
live
with
*NL*
me
.
_
I
_
am
not
afraid
of
him
,
_
I
_
am
not
proud
,
_
I
_
am
ready
to
take
*NL*
care
of
him
,
and
shall
not
ill-treat
him
as
some
people
-LRB-
besides
the
*NL*
asylum
folks
-RRB-
have
done
.
After
a
good
deal
of
squabbling
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
*NL*
``
I
got
him
;
and
he
has
been
here
ever
since
.
He
is
the
most
friendly
and
*NL*
amenable
creature
in
existence
;
and
as
for
advice
!

But
nobody
knows
*NL*
what
that
man
's
mind
is
,
except
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
smoothed
her
dress
and
shook
her
head
,
as
if
she
smoothed
*NL*
defiance
of
the
whole
world
out
of
the
one
,
and
shook
it
out
of
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
a
favorite
sister
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
a
good
creature
,
and
very
*NL*
kind
to
him

But
she
did
what
they
all
do
--
took
a
husband
.
And
_
he
_
did
*NL*
what
they
all
do
--
made
her
wretched
.
It
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
mind
*NL*
of
Mr.
Dick

that
's
_
not
madness
I
hope

-RRB-
that
,
combined
with
his
fear
*NL*
of
his
brother
,
and
his
sense
of
his
unkindness
,
it
threw
him
into
a
*NL*
fever
.
That
was
before
he
came
to
me
,
but
the
recollection
of
it
is
*NL*
oppressive
to
him
even
now
.
Did
he
say
anything
to
you
about
King
*NL*
Charles
the
First
,
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
as
if
she
were
a
little
vexed
.
*NL*
``
That
's
his
allegorical
way
of
expressing
it
.
He
connects
his
illness
*NL*
with
great
disturbance
and
agitation
,
naturally
,
and
that
's
the
figure
,
*NL*
or
the
simile
,
or
whatever
it
's
called
,
which
he
chooses
to
use
.
And
why
*NL*
should
n't
he
,
if
he
thinks
proper
!

*NL*
*NL*
I
said
:
``
Certainly
,
aunt

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
business-like
way
of
speaking
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
nor
a
worldly
*NL*
way
.
I
am
aware
of
that
;
and
that
's
the
reason
why
I
insist
upon
it
,
*NL*
that
there
sha
n't
be
a
word
about
it
in
his
Memorial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
Memorial
about
his
own
history
that
he
is
writing
,
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
child
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
again
.
``
He
is
memorialising

Lord
Chancellor

Lord

*NL*
at
all
events
,
who
are
paid
to

be
_
memorialised
--
about
his
affairs
.
I
*NL*
suppose
it
will
go
in
,
one
of
these
days
.
He
has
n't
been
able
to
draw
it
*NL*
up
yet
,
without
introducing
that
mode
of
expressing
himself
;
but
it
*NL*
do
n't
signify
;
it
keeps
him
employed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
I
found
out
afterwards
that
Mr.
Dick
had
been
for
upwards
of
*NL*
ten
years
endeavouring
to
keep
King
Charles
the
First
out
of
the
*NL*
Memorial
;
but
he
had
been
constantly
getting
into
it
,
and
was
there
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
again
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
nobody
knows
what
that
man
's
mind
is
*NL*
except
myself
;
and
he
's
the
most
amenable
and
friendly
creature
in
*NL*
existence
.
If
he
likes
to
fly
a
kite
sometimes
,
what
of
that
!
Franklin
*NL*
used
to
fly
a
kite
.
He
was
a
Quaker
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
if
I
am
*NL*
not
mistaken
.
And
a
Quaker
flying
a
kite
is
a
much
more
ridiculous
*NL*
object
than
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
could
have
supposed
that
my
aunt
had
recounted
these
particulars
*NL*
for
my
especial
behoof
,
and
as
a
piece
of
confidence
in
me
,
I
should
*NL*
have
felt
very
much
distinguished
,
and
should
have
augured
favourably
*NL*
from
such
a
mark
of
her
good
opinion
.
But
I
could
hardly
help
observing
*NL*
that
she
had
launched
into
them
,
chiefly
because
the
question
was
raised
*NL*
in
her
own
mind
,
and
with
very
little
reference
to
me
,
though
she
had
*NL*
addressed
herself
to
me
in
the
absence
of
anybody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
I
must
say
that
the
generosity
of
her
championship
of
*NL*
poor
harmless
Mr.
Dick
,
not
only
inspired
my
young
breast
with
some
*NL*
selfish
hope
for
myself
,
but
warmed
it
unselfishly
towards
her
.
I
*NL*
believe
that
I
began
to
know
that
there
was
something
about
my
aunt
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
her
many
eccentricities
and
odd
humours
,
to
be
honored
*NL*
and
trusted
in
.
Though
she
was
just
as
sharp
that
day
,
as
on
the
day
*NL*
before
,
and
was
in
and
out
about
the
donkeys
just
as
often
,
and
was
*NL*
thrown
into
a
tremendous
state
of
indignation
,
when
a
young
man
,
going
*NL*
by
,
ogled
Janet
at
a
window
-LRB-
which
was
one
of
the
gravest
misdemeanors
*NL*
that
could
be
committed
against
my
aunt
's
dignity
-RRB-
,
she
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
command
more
of
my
respect
,
if
not
less
of
my
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anxiety
I
underwent
,
in
the
interval
which
necessarily
elapsed
*NL*
before
a
reply
could
be
received
to
her
letter
to
Mr.
Murdstone
,
was
*NL*
extreme
;
but
I
made
an
endeavour
to
suppress
it
,
and
to
be
as
agreeable
*NL*
as
I
could
in
a
quiet
way
,
both
to
my
aunt
and
Mr.
Dick
.
The
latter
and
*NL*
I
would
have
gone
out
to
fly
the
great
kite
;
but
that
I
had
still
no
*NL*
other
clothes
than
the
anything
but
ornamental
garments
with
which
I
had
*NL*
been
decorated
on
the
first
day
,
and
which
confined
me
to
the
house
,
*NL*
except
for
an
hour
after
dark
,
when
my
aunt
,
for
my
health
's
sake
,
*NL*
paraded
me
up
and
down
on
the
cliff
outside
,
before
going
to
bed
.
At
*NL*
length
the
reply
from
Mr.
Murdstone
came
,
and
my
aunt
informed
me
,
to
my
*NL*
infinite
terror
,
that
he
was
coming
to
speak
to
her
himself
on
the
next
*NL*
day
.
On
the
next
day
,
still
bundled
up
in
my
curious
habiliments
,
I
sat
*NL*
counting
the
time
,
flushed
and
heated
by
the
conflict
of
sinking
hopes
*NL*
and
rising
fears
within
me
;
and
waiting
to
be
startled
by
the
sight
of
*NL*
the
gloomy
face
,
whose
non-arrival
startled
me
every
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
a
little
more
imperious
and
stern
than
usual
,
but
I
observed
*NL*
no
other
token
of
her
preparing
herself
to
receive
the
visitor
so
much
*NL*
dreaded
by
me
.
She
sat
at
work
in
the
window
,
and
I
sat
by
,
with
my
*NL*
thoughts
running
astray
on
all
possible
and
impossible
results
of
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
's
visit
,
until
pretty
late
in
the
afternoon
.
Our
dinner
had
*NL*
been
indefinitely
postponed
;
but
it
was
growing
so
late
,
that
my
aunt
*NL*
had
ordered
it
to
be
got
ready
,
when
she
gave
a
sudden
alarm
of
donkeys
,
*NL*
and
to
my
consternation
and
amazement
,
I
beheld
Miss
Murdstone
,
on
a
*NL*
side-saddle
,
ride
deliberately
over
the
sacred
piece
of
green
,
and
stop
*NL*
in
front
of
the
house
,
looking
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
you
!
''
cried
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
fist
at
the
*NL*
window
.
``
You
have
no
business
there
.
How
dare
you
trespass
?
Go
along
!
*NL*
Oh
,
you
bold-faced
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
so
exasperated
by
the
coolness
with
which
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
looked
about
her
,
that
I
really
believe
she
was
motionless
,
and
unable
*NL*
for
the
moment
to
dart
out
according
to
custom
.
I
seized
the
opportunity
*NL*
to
inform
her
who
it
was
;
and
that
the
gentleman
now
coming
near
the
*NL*
offender
-LRB-
for
the
way
up
was
very
steep
,
and
he
had
dropped
behind
-RRB-
,
was
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
who
it
is
!
''
cried
my
aunt
,
still
shaking
her
head
,
and
*NL*
gesticulating
anything
but
welcome
from
the
bow-window
.
``
I
wo
n't
be
*NL*
trespassed
upon
.
I
wo
n't
allow
it
.
Go
away
!
Janet
,
turn
him
round
.
*NL*
Lead
him
off
!
''
and
I
saw
,
from
behind
my
aunt
,
a
sort
of
hurried
*NL*
battle-piece
,
in
which
the
donkey
stood
resisting
everybody
,
with
all
*NL*
his
four
legs
planted
different
ways
,
while
Janet
tried
to
pull
him
*NL*
round
by
the
bridle
,
Mr.
Murdstone
tried
to
lead
him
on
,
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
struck
at
Janet
with
a
parasol
,
and
several
boys
,
who
had
come
to
see
*NL*
the
engagement
,
shouted
vigorously
.
But
my
aunt
,
suddenly
descrying
*NL*
among
them
the
young
malefactor
who
was
the
donkey
's
guardian
,
and
who
*NL*
was
one
of
the
most
inveterate
offenders
against
her
,
though
hardly
*NL*
in
his
teens
,
rushed
out
to
the
scene
of
action
,
pounced
upon
him
,
*NL*
captured
him
,
dragged
him
,
with
his
jacket
over
his
head
,
and
his
heels
*NL*
grinding
the
ground
,
into
the
garden
,
and
,
calling
upon
Janet
to
fetch
*NL*
the
constables
and
justices
that
he
might
be
taken
,
tried
,
and
executed
*NL*
on
the
spot
,
held
him
at
bay
there
.
This
part
of
the
business
,
however
,
*NL*
did
not
last
long
;
for
the
young
rascal
,
being
expert
at
a
variety
*NL*
of
feints
and
dodges
,
of
which
my
aunt
had
no
conception
,
soon
went
*NL*
whooping
away
,
leaving
some
deep
impressions
of
his
nailed
boots
in
the
*NL*
flower-beds
,
and
taking
his
donkey
in
triumph
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
,
during
the
latter
portion
of
the
contest
,
had
*NL*
dismounted
,
and
was
now
waiting
with
her
brother
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
steps
,
until
my
aunt
should
be
at
leisure
to
receive
them
.
My
aunt
,
a
*NL*
little
ruffled
by
the
combat
,
marched
past
them
into
the
house
,
with
*NL*
great
dignity
,
and
took
no
notice
of
their
presence
,
until
they
were
*NL*
announced
by
Janet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
away
,
aunt
?
''
I
asked
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
Certainly
not
!
''
With
which
she
pushed
me
into
*NL*
a
corner
near
her
,
and
fenced
me
in
with
a
chair
,
as
if
it
were
a
prison
*NL*
or
a
bar
of
justice
.
This
position
I
continued
to
occupy
during
the
*NL*
whole
interview
,
and
from
it
I
now
saw
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
enter
the
*NL*
room
.

*NL*
``

said
my
aunt
,
``
I
was
not
aware
at
first

I
had
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
objecting

But
I
do

allow
anybody

ride
over

I
make

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
regulation

rather
awkward

said
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it

''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Murdstone
seemed
afraid
of
a
renewal
of
hostilities
,
and
interposing
*NL*
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Trotwood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

observed
my
aunt
with
a
keen
look
.
``

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
excuse
my
saying

returned
my
aunt
,
``
that
I
think
it
would
*NL*
have
been
a
much
better

happier
thing
if
you
had
left

child
alone

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
so
far
agree
with
what
Miss
Trotwood
has
remarked

observed
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
,
bridling
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
my

nobody

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

returned
Miss
Murdstone
,
though
,
I
thought
,
not
with
a
very
*NL*
ready
or
gracious
assent
.
``
And
it
certainly
might

he
had
never

such
a

always
been

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no

my

ringing

``
my

*NL*
*NL*
Until
he
came
,
my
aunt
sat
perfectly
upright
and
stiff
,
frowning
at
the
*NL*
wall
.
When
he
came
,
my
aunt
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

my

*NL*
with
emphasis
,
as
an
admonition
to
Mr.

,
who
was
biting
his
*NL*
forefinger
and
looking
rather
foolish
,
``
I
rely

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
took
his
finger
out
of
his
mouth
,
on
this
hint

stood
among
*NL*
the
group
,
with
a
grave
and
attentive

My

inclined
her
head
to
Mr.

who
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Trotwood

on
the
receipt
of
your
letter

I
considered
it
an
act

greater
justice

myself

perhaps
of
more
respect
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

said
my

still
eyeing
him
keenly

You

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
answer
it
in

however
inconvenient
the
journey

pursued
Mr.

Murdstone
,
``
rather
than
by

This
unhappy
boy

has
run
away
*NL*
from
his
friends

his
occupation

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whose
appearance

''
interposed
his
sister
,
directing
general
*NL*
attention
to
me
in
my
indefinable
costume
,
``
is
perfectly
scandalous
and
*NL*
disgraceful

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
Murdstone

said
her

``

the
goodness
not

interrupt
*NL*
me

This

has
been
the
occasion
of
much
*NL*
domestic
trouble
and
uneasiness
;
both
during
the
lifetime
of
my
late

dear
wife

since

He
has
a
sullen

rebellious

a
violent

temper

an
untoward

intractable
disposition

Both
my

myself
have
endeavoured
to
correct
his

ineffectually

And
I

have
felt

we
both
have
felt
,
I
may
say
;
my
sister
being
fully
in
my

confidence

that
it

right

should
receive
this
grave

dispassionate

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
hardly
be
necessary
for
me
to
confirm
anything
stated
by

said
Miss
Murdstone
;
``
but
I
beg
to
observe

that

I
believe
this
is
the
worst

*NL*
*NL*
``
Strong

said
my

shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
at

Miss

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha

said
my
aunt
.
``
Well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my

resumed
Mr.
Murdstone
,
whose
face
darkened
*NL*
more
and
more
,
the
more
he
and
my
aunt
observed
each
other
,
which
they
*NL*
did
very
narrowly
,
``
as
to
the
best
mode

bringing
him
up

they
are
*NL*
founded

of
him

and
in
part
on
my
knowledge

*NL*
my
own
means

resources

I
am
responsible
for
them
to
myself
,
I
act
*NL*
upon
them
,
and
I
say
no
more
about
them

It
is
enough
that
I
place
this
*NL*
boy
under
the
eye
of
a
friend
of
my
own
,
in
a
respectable
business
;
that
*NL*
it
does
not
please
him
;
that
he
runs
away
from
it

makes
himself
a
*NL*
common
vagabond
about
the
country
;

comes
here
,
in
rags

to
appeal
to
*NL*
you

Miss

I
wish
to
set
before
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
about
the
respectable

first

said
my

.
``
If
he
had

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Miss

striking
*NL*
in
,
``
his

have
been

*NL*
*NL*

said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe

said
Mr.
Murdstone
,
with
an
inclination
of
his
head
,
``
that
*NL*
Clara
would
have
disputed
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
Miss

confirmed
this
,
with
an
audible
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!

said
my

``
Unfortunate

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
,
who
had
been
rattling
his
money
all
this

was
rattling
it
*NL*
so
loudly
now
,
that
my
aunt
felt
it
necessary
to
check
him
with
a
look
,
*NL*
before
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Died
with

replied
Mr.
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

there
was
no

*NL*
*NL*

It

Mr.

Murdstone
began
,
when
my

caught
him
up
with
the
greatest
*NL*
irascibility

impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

there

no

I

David

looking

any

condition
of
any

though
it
stared
him
point-blank
in

it
was
left

when

took

step

short
,

said
my
aunt
,
``
to
be
plain

did
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

my

shaking
her
head
at
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
this

he
returned

of
abetting

in

running
away

in

complaints

Your
manner
,
which
I
must
say
does
not
seem
intended

it
possible

Now
I

you
abet

I
take
it

*NL*
open

*NL*
*NL*
To
this
address

my
aunt
had
listened
with
the
closest
attention
,
*NL*
sitting
perfectly
upright
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
one
knee
,
and
*NL*
looking
grimly
on
the
speaker
.
When
he
had
finished
,
she
turned
her
eyes
*NL*
so
as
to
command
Miss
Murdstone
,
without
otherwise
disturbing
her
*NL*
attitude
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

ma'am

have
_
you

got
anything
to
remark
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

said
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
all

be
the

been
so
plainly
stated

that
I
have
nothing
to
add

my
*NL*
thanks
for
your
politeness

For
your
very
great
politeness

I
am
sure

*NL*
said
Miss
Murdstone
;
with
an
irony
which
no
more
affected
my
aunt
,
than
*NL*
it
discomposed
the
cannon
I
had
slept
by
at
Chatham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
the

say

said
my

``
Are

ready

go

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
no
,
and
entreated
her
not
to
let
me
go
.
I
said
that
neither
*NL*
Mr.

Miss
Murdstone
had
ever
liked
me
,
or
had
ever
been
kind
to
me
.
*NL*
That
they
had
made
my
mama

who
always
loved
me
dearly
,
unhappy
about
*NL*
me
,
and
that
I
knew
it
well
,
and
that
Peggotty
knew
it
.
I
said
that
I
*NL*
had
been
more
miserable
than
I
thought
anybody
could
believe
,
who
only
*NL*
knew
how
young
I
was
.
And
I
begged
and
prayed
my
aunt
--
I
forget
in
what
*NL*
terms
now
,
but
I
remember
that
they
affected
me
very
much
then
--
to
*NL*
befriend
and
protect
me
,
for
my
father
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

said
my

``
what

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

considered

hesitated

brightened

my

triumphantly

invaluable

Having
shaken
it
with
great
cordiality
,
she
*NL*
pulled
me
towards
her
,
and
said
to
Mr.
Murdstone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

turning

continuing

shake
her
head
at

him

infinite

unmoved
by
it
,
Miss
Betsey
*NL*
pursued
her
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
clear
enough
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
years
before
_
you
_
ever
saw
*NL*
her
--
and
why
,
in
the
mysterious
dispensations
of
Providence
,
you
ever
*NL*
did
see
her
,
is
more
than
humanity
can
comprehend
--
it
was
clear
enough
*NL*
that
the
poor
soft
little
thing
would
marry
somebody
,
at
some
time
or
*NL*
other
;
but
I
did
hope
it
would
n't
have
been
as
bad
as
it
has
turned
out
.
*NL*
That
was
the
time
,
Mr.
Murdstone
,
when
she
gave
birth
to
her
boy
here
,
''
*NL*
said
my
aunt
;
``
to
the
poor
child
you
sometimes
tormented
her
through
*NL*
afterwards
,
which
is
a
disagreeable
remembrance
,
and
makes
the
sight
of
*NL*
him
odious
now
.
Aye
,
aye
!
you
need
n't
wince
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
I
know
it
's
*NL*
true
without
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stood
by
the
door
,
all
this
while
,
observant
of
her
with
a
smile
*NL*
upon
his
face
,
though
his
black
eyebrows
were
heavily
contracted
.
I
*NL*
remarked
now
,
that
,
though
the
smile
was
on
his
face
still
,
his
colour
*NL*
had
gone
in
a
moment
,
and
he
seemed
to
breathe
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
sir
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
good
bye
!
Good
day
to
you
too
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
turning
suddenly
upon
his
sister
.
``
Let
me
see
you
*NL*
ride
a
donkey
over
_
my
_
green
again
,
and
as
sure
as
you
have
a
head
upon
*NL*
your
shoulders
,
I
'll
knock
your
bonnet
off
,
and
tread
upon
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
require
a
painter
,
and
no
common
painter
too
,
to
depict
my
*NL*
aunt
's
face
as
she
delivered
herself
of
this
very
unexpected
sentiment
,
*NL*
and
Miss
Murdstone
's
face
as
she
heard
it
.
But
the
manner
of
the
speech
,
*NL*
no
less
than
the
matter
,
was
so
fiery
,
that
Miss
Murdstone
,
without
a
*NL*
word
in
answer
,
discreetly
put
her
arm
through
her
brother
's
,
and
walked
*NL*
haughtily
out
of
the
cottage
;
my
aunt
remaining
in
the
window
looking
*NL*
after
them
;
prepared
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
in
case
of
the
donkey
's
*NL*
reappearance
,
to
carry
her
threat
into
instant
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
attempt
at
defiance
being
made
,
however
,
her
face
gradually
relaxed
,
*NL*
and
became
so
pleasant
,
that
I
was
emboldened
to
kiss
and
thank
her
;
*NL*
which
I
did
with
great
heartiness
,
and
with
both
my
arms
clasped
round
*NL*
her
neck
.
I
then
shook
hands
with
Mr.
Dick
,
who
shook
hands
with
me
a
*NL*
great
many
times
,
and
hailed
this
happy
close
of
the
proceedings
with
*NL*
repeated
bursts
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
consider
yourself
guardian
,
jointly
with
me
,
of
this
child
,
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
delighted
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
to
be
the
guardian
of
David
's
*NL*
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
''
_
that
's
_
settled
.
I
have
been
thinking
,
*NL*
do
you
know
,
Mr.
Dick
,
that
I
might
call
him
Trotwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
certainly
.
Call
him
Trotwood
,
certainly
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
``
David
's
son
's
Trotwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
you
mean
,
''
returned
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
Yes
.
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
a
little
*NL*
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
took
so
kindly
to
the
notion
,
that
some
ready-made
clothes
,
*NL*
which
were
purchased
for
me
that
afternoon
,
were
marked
``
Trotwood
*NL*
Copperfield
,
''
in
her
own
handwriting
,
and
in
indelible
marking-ink
,
*NL*
before
I
put
them
on
;
and
it
was
settled
that
all
the
other
clothes
*NL*
which
were
ordered
to
be
made
for
me
-LRB-
a
complete
outfit
was
bespoke
that
*NL*
afternoon
-RRB-
should
be
marked
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
began
my
new
life
,
in
a
new
name
,
and
with
everything
new
about
*NL*
me
.
Now
that
the
state
of
doubt
was
over
,
I
felt
,
for
many
days
,
like
*NL*
one
in
a
dream
.
I
never
thought
that
I
had
a
curious
couple
of
*NL*
guardians
,
in
my
aunt
and
Mr.
Dick
.
I
never
thought
of
anything
about
*NL*
myself
,
distinctly
.
The
two
things
clearest
in
my
mind
were
,
that
a
*NL*
remoteness
had
come
upon
the
old
Blunderstone
life
--
which
seemed
to
lie
*NL*
in
the
haze
of
an
immeasurable
distance
;
and
that
a
curtain
had
for
ever
*NL*
fallen
on
my
life
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
No
one
has
ever
raised
that
*NL*
curtain
since
.
I
have
lifted
it
for
a
moment
,
even
in
this
narrative
,
*NL*
with
a
reluctant
hand
,
and
dropped
it
gladly
.
The
remembrance
of
that
*NL*
life
is
fraught
with
so
much
pain
to
me
,
with
so
much
mental
suffering
*NL*
and
want
of
hope
,
that
I
have
never
had
the
courage
even
to
examine
how
*NL*
long
I
was
doomed
to
lead
it
.
Whether
it
lasted
for
a
year
,
or
more
,
or
*NL*
less
,
I
do
not
know
.
I
only
know
that
it
was
,
and
ceased
to
be
;
and
that
*NL*
I
have
written
,
and
there
I
leave
it
.

CHAPTER
XV
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
MAKE
ANOTHER
BEGINNING
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
and
I
soon
became
the
best
of
friends
,
and
very
often
,
when
his
*NL*
day
's
work
was
done
,
went
out
together
to
fly
the
great
kite
.
Every
day
*NL*
of
his
life
he
had
a
long
sitting
at
the
Memorial
,
which
never
made
the
*NL*
least
progress
,
however
hard
he
labored
,
for
King
Charles
the
First
*NL*
always
strayed
into
it
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
then
it
was
thrown
aside
,
*NL*
and
another
one
begun
.
The
patience
and
hope
with
which
he
bore
these
*NL*
perpetual
disappointments
,
the
mild
perception
he
had
that
there
was
*NL*
something
wrong
about
King
Charles
the
First
,
the
feeble
efforts
he
made
*NL*
to
keep
him
out
,
and
the
certainty
with
which
he
came
in
,
and
tumbled
*NL*
the
Memorial
out
of
all
shape
,
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
.
What
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
supposed
would
come
of
the
Memorial
,
if
it
were
completed
;
where
he
*NL*
thought
it
was
to
go
,
or
what
he
thought
it
was
to
do
;
he
knew
no
more
*NL*
than
anybody
else
,
I
believe
.
Nor
was
it
at
all
necessary
that
he
should
*NL*
trouble
himself
with
such
questions
,
for
if
anything
were
certain
under
*NL*
the
sun
,
it
was
certain
that
the
Memorial
never
would
be
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
an
affecting
sight
,
I
used
to
think
,
to
see
him
with
the
*NL*
kite
when
it
was
up
a
great
height
in
the
air
.
What
he
had
told
me
,
in
*NL*
his
room
,
about
his
belief
in
its
disseminating
the
statements
pasted
on
*NL*
it
,
which
were
nothing
but
old
leaves
of
abortive
Memorials
,
might
have
*NL*
been
a
fancy
with
him
sometimes
;
but
not
when
he
was
out
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
the
kite
in
the
sky
,
and
feeling
it
pull
and
tug
at
his
hand
.
He
never
*NL*
looked
so
serene
as
he
did
then
.
I
used
to
fancy
,
as
I
sat
by
him
of
an
*NL*
evening
,
on
a
green
slope
,
and
saw
him
watch
the
kite
high
in
the
quiet
*NL*
air
,
that
it
lifted
his
mind
out
of
its
confusion
,
and
bore
it
-LRB-
such
was
*NL*
my
boyish
thought
-RRB-
into
the
skies
.
As
he
wound
the
string
in
,
and
it
*NL*
came
lower
and
lower
down
out
of
the
beautiful
light
,
until
it
fluttered
*NL*
to
the
ground
,
and
lay
there
like
a
dead
thing
,
he
seemed
to
wake
*NL*
gradually
out
of
a
dream
;
and
I
remember
to
have
seen
him
take
it
up
,
*NL*
and
look
about
him
in
a
lost
way
,
as
if
they
had
both
come
down
*NL*
together
,
so
that
I
pitied
him
with
all
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
advanced
in
friendship
and
intimacy
with
Mr.
Dick
,
I
did
not
go
*NL*
backward
in
the
favor
of
his
staunch
friend
,
my
aunt
.
She
took
so
kindly
*NL*
to
me
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
she
shortened
my
adopted
name
*NL*
of
Trotwood
into
Trot
;
and
even
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
if
I
went
on
*NL*
as
I
had
begun
,
I
might
take
equal
rank
in
her
affections
with
my
sister
*NL*
Betsey
Trotwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
one
evening
,
when
the
backgammon-board
was
placed
*NL*
as
usual
for
herself
and
Mr.
Dick
,
``
we
must
not
forget
your
education
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
only
subject
of
anxiety
,
and
I
felt
quite
delighted
by
her
*NL*
referring
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
to
go
to
school
at
Canterbury
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
as
it
was
so
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
Should
you
like
to
go
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
already
no
stranger
to
the
general
rapidity
of
my
aunt
's
*NL*
evolutions
,
I
was
not
surprised
by
the
suddenness
of
the
proposal
,
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
my
aunt
again
.
``
Janet
,
hire
the
grey
pony
and
chaise
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
pack
up
Master
Trotwood
's
clothes
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
greatly
elated
by
these
orders
;
but
my
heart
smote
me
for
my
*NL*
selfishness
,
when
I
witnessed
their
effect
on
Mr.
Dick
,
who
was
so
*NL*
low-spirited
at
the
prospect
of
our
separation
,
and
played
so
ill
in
*NL*
consequence
,
that
my
aunt
,
after
giving
him
several
admonitory
raps
on
*NL*
the
knuckles
with
her
dice-box
,
shut
up
the
board
,
and
declined
to
play
*NL*
with
him
any
more
.
But
,
on
hearing
from
my
aunt
that
I
should
sometimes
*NL*
come
over
on
a
Saturday
,
and
that
he
could
sometimes
come
and
see
me
*NL*
on
a
Wednesday
,
he
revived
;
and
vowed
to
make
another
kite
for
those
*NL*
occasions
,
of
proportions
greatly
surpassing
the
present
one
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
he
was
downhearted
again
,
and
would
have
sustained
himself
by
*NL*
giving
me
all
the
money
he
had
in
his
possession
,
gold
and
silver
too
,
*NL*
if
my
aunt
had
not
interposed
,
and
limited
the
gift
to
five
shillings
,
*NL*
which
,
at
his
earnest
petition
,
were
afterwards
increased
to
ten
.
We
*NL*
parted
at
the
garden-gate
in
a
most
affectionate
manner
,
and
Mr.
Dick
*NL*
did
not
go
into
the
house
until
my
aunt
had
driven
me
out
of
sight
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
who
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
public
opinion
,
drove
the
grey
*NL*
pony
through
Dover
in
a
masterly
manner
;
sitting
high
and
stiff
like
a
*NL*
state
coachman
,
keeping
a
steady
eye
upon
him
wherever
he
went
,
and
*NL*
making
a
point
of
not
letting
him
have
his
own
way
in
any
respect
.
When
*NL*
we
came
into
the
country
road
,
she
permitted
him
to
relax
a
little
,
*NL*
however
;
and
looking
at
me
down
in
a
valley
of
cushion
by
her
side
,
*NL*
asked
me
whether
I
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
happy
indeed
,
thank
you
,
aunt
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
much
gratified
;
and
both
her
hands
being
occupied
,
patted
me
on
*NL*
the
head
with
her
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
large
school
,
aunt
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
We
are
going
to
Mr.
Wickfield
's
*NL*
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
_
he
_
keep
a
school
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
He
keeps
an
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
for
no
more
information
about
Mr.
Wickfield
,
as
she
offered
*NL*
none
,
and
we
conversed
on
other
subjects
until
we
came
to
Canterbury
,
*NL*
where
,
as
it
was
market-day
,
my
aunt
had
a
great
opportunity
of
*NL*
insinuating
the
grey
pony
among
carts
,
baskets
,
vegetables
,
and
*NL*
huckster
's
goods
.
The
hair-breadth
turns
and
twists
we
made
,
drew
down
*NL*
upon
us
a
variety
of
speeches
from
the
people
standing
about
,
which
were
*NL*
not
always
complimentary
;
but
my
aunt
drove
on
with
perfect
*NL*
indifference
,
and
I
dare
say
would
have
taken
her
own
way
with
as
much
*NL*
coolness
through
an
enemy
's
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
stopped
before
a
very
old
house
bulging
out
over
the
road
;
*NL*
a
house
with
long
low
lattice-windows
bulging
out
still
farther
,
and
*NL*
beams
with
carved
heads
on
the
ends
bulging
out
too
,
so
that
I
fancied
*NL*
the
whole
house
was
leaning
forward
,
trying
to
see
who
was
passing
on
*NL*
the
narrow
pavement
below
.
It
was
quite
spotless
in
its
cleanliness
.
The
*NL*
old-fashioned
brass
knocker
on
the
low
arched
door
,
ornamented
with
*NL*
carved
garlands
of
fruit
and
flowers
,
twinkled
like
a
star
;
the
two
*NL*
stone
steps
descending
to
the
door
were
as
white
as
if
they
had
been
*NL*
covered
with
fair
linen
;
and
all
the
angles
and
corners
,
and
carvings
*NL*
and
mouldings
,
and
quaint
little
panes
of
glass
,
and
quainter
little
*NL*
windows
,
though
as
old
as
the
hills
,
were
as
pure
as
any
snow
that
ever
*NL*
fell
upon
the
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
pony-chaise
stopped
at
the
door
,
and
my
eyes
were
intent
upon
*NL*
the
house
,
I
saw
a
cadaverous
face
appear
at
a
small
window
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
-LRB-
in
a
little
round
tower
that
formed
one
side
of
the
*NL*
house
-RRB-
,
and
quickly
disappear
.
The
low
arched
door
then
opened
,
and
the
*NL*
face
came
out
.
It
was
quite
as
cadaverous
as
it
had
looked
in
the
*NL*
window
,
though
in
the
grain
of
it
there
was
that
tinge
of
red
which
is
*NL*
sometimes
to
be
observed
in
the
skins
of
red-haired
people
.
It
belonged
*NL*
to
a
red-haired
person
--
a
youth
of
fifteen
,
as
I
take
it
now
,
but
*NL*
looking
much
older
--
whose
hair
was
cropped
as
close
as
the
closest
*NL*
stubble
;
who
had
hardly
any
eyebrows
,
and
no
eyelashes
,
and
eyes
of
a
*NL*
red-brown
;
so
unsheltered
and
unshaded
,
that
I
remember
wondering
how
he
*NL*
went
to
sleep
.
He
was
high-shouldered
and
bony
;
dressed
in
decent
black
,
*NL*
with
a
white
wisp
of
a
neckcloth
;
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
;
and
had
a
*NL*
long
,
lank
,
skeleton
hand
,
which
particularly
attracted
my
attention
,
as
*NL*
he
stood
at
the
pony
's
head
,
rubbing
his
chin
with
it
,
and
looking
up
at
*NL*
us
in
the
chaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Wickfield
at
home
,
Uriah
Heep
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wickfield
's
at
home
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Uriah
Heep
,
``
if
you
'll
please
to
*NL*
walk
in
there
''
--
pointing
with
his
long
hand
to
the
room
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
out
;
and
leaving
him
to
hold
the
pony
,
went
into
a
long
low
*NL*
parlor
looking
towards
the
street
,
from
the
window
of
which
I
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
,
as
I
went
in
,
of
Uriah
Heep
breathing
into
the
pony
's
nostrils
,
*NL*
and
immediately
covering
them
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
were
putting
some
*NL*
spell
upon
him
.
Opposite
to
the
tall
old
chimney-piece
,
were
two
*NL*
portraits
:
one
of
a
gentleman
with
grey
hair
-LRB-
though
not
by
any
means
an
*NL*
old
man
-RRB-
and
black
eyebrows
,
who
was
looking
over
some
papers
tied
*NL*
together
with
red
tape
;
the
other
,
of
a
lady
,
with
a
very
placid
and
*NL*
sweet
expression
of
face
,
who
was
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
I
was
turning
about
in
search
of
Uriah
's
picture
,
when
,
a
door
*NL*
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
opening
,
a
gentleman
entered
,
at
sight
of
*NL*
whom
I
turned
to
the
first-mentioned
portrait
again
,
to
make
quite
sure
*NL*
that
it
had
not
come
out
of
its
frame
.
But
it
was
stationary
;
and
as
the
*NL*
gentleman
advanced
into
the
light
,
I
saw
that
he
was
some
years
older
*NL*
than
when
he
had
had
his
picture
painted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
pray
walk
in
.
I
was
engaged
*NL*
for
the
moment
,
but
you
'll
excuse
my
being
busy
.
You
know
my
motive
.
I
*NL*
have
but
one
in
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Betsey
thanked
him
,
and
we
went
into
his
room
,
which
was
furnished
*NL*
as
an
office
,
with
books
,
papers
,
tin
boxes
,
and
so
forth
.
It
looked
*NL*
into
a
garden
,
and
had
an
iron
safe
let
into
the
wall
;
so
immediately
*NL*
over
the
mantel-shelf
,
that
I
wondered
,
as
I
sat
down
,
how
the
sweeps
*NL*
got
round
it
when
they
swept
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
;
for
I
soon
found
that
it
was
*NL*
he
,
and
that
he
was
a
lawyer
,
and
steward
of
the
estates
of
a
rich
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
county
;
``
what
wind
blows
you
here
?
Not
an
ill
wind
,
I
*NL*
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
my
aunt
,
``
I
have
not
come
for
any
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
You
had
better
come
for
*NL*
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hair
was
quite
white
now
,
though
his
eyebrows
were
still
black
.
He
*NL*
had
a
very
agreeable
face
,
and
,
I
thought
,
was
handsome
.
There
was
a
*NL*
certain
richness
in
his
complexion
,
which
I
had
been
long
accustomed
,
*NL*
under
Peggotty
's
tuition
,
to
connect
with
port
wine
;
and
I
fancied
it
*NL*
was
in
his
voice
too
,
and
referred
his
growing
corpulency
to
the
same
*NL*
cause
.
He
was
very
cleanly
dressed
,
in
a
blue
coat
,
striped
waistcoat
,
*NL*
and
nankeen
trowsers
;
and
his
fine
frilled
shirt
and
cambric
neckcloth
*NL*
looked
unusually
soft
and
white
,
reminding
my
strolling
fancy
-LRB-
I
call
to
*NL*
mind
-RRB-
of
the
plumage
on
the
breast
of
a
swan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
nephew
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
aware
you
had
one
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
grand-nephew
,
that
is
to
say
,
''
observed
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
aware
you
had
a
grand-nephew
,
I
give
you
my
word
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
adopted
him
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
,
importing
*NL*
that
his
knowledge
and
his
ignorance
were
all
one
to
her
,
``
and
I
have
*NL*
brought
him
here
,
to
put
him
to
a
school
where
he
may
be
thoroughly
well
*NL*
taught
,
and
well
treated
.
Now
tell
me
where
that
school
is
,
and
what
it
*NL*
is
,
and
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
can
advise
you
properly
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
--
``
the
old
*NL*
question
,
you
know
.
What
's
your
motive
in
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deuce
take
the
man
!
''
exclaimed
my
aunt
.
``
Always
fishing
for
motives
,
*NL*
when
they
're
on
the
surface
!
Why
,
to
make
the
child
happy
and
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
a
mixed
motive
,
I
think
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
and
smiling
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mixed
fiddlestick
!
''
returned
my
aunt
.
``
You
claim
to
have
one
plain
*NL*
motive
in
all
you
do
yourself
.
You
do
n't
suppose
,
I
hope
,
that
you
are
*NL*
the
only
plain
dealer
in
the
world
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
I
have
only
one
motive
in
life
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
he
rejoined
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
Other
people
have
dozens
,
scores
,
hundreds
.
I
have
only
one
.
*NL*
There
's
the
difference
.
However
,
that
's
beside
the
question
.
The
best
*NL*
school
?
Whatever
the
motive
,
you
want
the
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
nodded
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
best
we
have
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
considering
,
``
your
nephew
*NL*
could
n't
board
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
could
board
somewhere
else
,
I
suppose
?
''
suggested
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
thought
I
could
.
After
a
little
discussion
,
he
proposed
to
*NL*
take
my
aunt
to
the
school
,
that
she
might
see
it
and
judge
for
herself
;
*NL*
also
,
to
take
her
,
with
the
same
object
,
to
two
or
three
houses
where
he
*NL*
thought
I
could
be
boarded
.
My
aunt
embracing
the
proposal
,
we
were
all
*NL*
three
going
out
together
,
when
he
stopped
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
little
friend
here
might
have
some
motive
,
perhaps
,
for
objecting
*NL*
to
the
arrangements
.
I
think
we
had
better
leave
him
behind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
seemed
disposed
to
contest
the
point
;
but
to
facilitate
matters
*NL*
I
said
I
would
gladly
remain
behind
,
if
they
pleased
;
and
returned
into
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
's
office
,
where
I
sat
down
again
,
in
the
chair
I
had
first
*NL*
occupied
,
to
await
their
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
this
chair
was
opposite
a
narrow
passage
,
which
*NL*
ended
in
the
little
circular
room
where
I
had
seen
Uriah
Heep
's
*NL*
pale
face
looking
out
of
window
.
Uriah
,
having
taken
the
pony
to
a
*NL*
neighbouring
stable
,
was
at
work
at
a
desk
in
this
room
,
which
had
a
*NL*
brass
frame
on
the
top
to
hang
papers
upon
,
and
on
which
the
writing
*NL*
he
was
making
a
copy
of
was
then
hanging
.
Though
his
face
was
towards
*NL*
me
,
I
thought
,
for
some
time
,
the
writing
being
between
us
,
that
he
*NL*
could
not
see
me
;
but
looking
that
way
more
attentively
,
it
made
me
*NL*
uncomfortable
to
observe
that
,
every
now
and
then
,
his
sleepless
eyes
*NL*
would
come
below
the
writing
,
like
two
red
suns
,
and
stealthily
stare
*NL*
at
me
for
I
dare
say
a
whole
minute
at
a
time
,
during
which
his
pen
*NL*
went
,
or
pretended
to
go
,
as
cleverly
as
ever
.
I
made
several
attempts
*NL*
to
get
out
of
their
way
--
such
as
standing
on
a
chair
to
look
at
a
map
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
poring
over
the
columns
of
a
Kentish
*NL*
newspaper
--
but
they
always
attracted
me
back
again
;
and
whenever
I
*NL*
looked
towards
those
two
red
suns
,
I
was
sure
to
find
them
,
either
just
*NL*
rising
or
just
setting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
much
to
my
relief
,
my
aunt
and
Mr.
Wickfield
came
back
,
after
*NL*
a
pretty
long
absence
.
They
were
not
so
successful
as
I
could
have
*NL*
wished
;
for
though
the
advantages
of
the
school
were
undeniable
,
my
aunt
*NL*
had
not
approved
of
any
of
the
boarding-houses
proposed
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
unfortunate
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
Trot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
_
does
_
happen
unfortunately
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
But
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
what
you
can
do
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
inquired
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
your
nephew
here
,
for
the
present
.
He
's
a
quiet
fellow
.
He
wo
n't
*NL*
disturb
me
at
all
.
It
's
a
capital
house
for
study
.
As
quiet
as
a
*NL*
monastery
,
and
almost
as
roomy
.
Leave
him
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
evidently
liked
the
offer
,
though
she
was
delicate
of
accepting
*NL*
it
.
So
did
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
This
is
the
way
out
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
.
It
's
only
a
temporary
arrangement
,
you
know
.
If
it
do
n't
act
*NL*
well
,
or
do
n't
quite
accord
with
our
mutual
convenience
,
he
can
easily
*NL*
go
to
the
right
about
.
There
will
be
time
to
find
some
better
place
for
*NL*
him
in
the
meanwhile
.
You
had
better
determine
to
leave
him
here
for
the
*NL*
present
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
my
aunt
;
``
and
so
is
he
,
I
see
;
*NL*
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
I
know
what
you
mean
,
''
cried
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
You
shall
not
be
*NL*
oppressed
by
the
receipt
of
favors
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
You
may
pay
for
him
*NL*
if
you
like
.
We
wo
n't
be
hard
about
terms
,
but
you
shall
pay
if
you
*NL*
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
that
understanding
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
though
it
does
n't
lessen
the
*NL*
real
obligation
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
leave
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
come
and
see
my
little
housekeeper
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
accordingly
went
up
a
wonderful
old
staircase
;
with
a
balustrade
so
*NL*
broad
that
we
might
have
gone
up
that
,
almost
as
easily
;
and
into
a
*NL*
shady
old
drawing-room
,
lighted
by
some
three
or
four
of
the
quaint
*NL*
windows
I
had
looked
up
at
from
the
street
:
which
had
old
oak
seats
in
*NL*
them
,
that
seemed
to
have
come
of
the
same
trees
as
the
shining
oak
*NL*
floor
,
and
the
great
beams
in
the
ceiling
.
It
was
a
prettily
furnished
*NL*
room
,
with
a
piano
and
some
lively
furniture
in
red
and
green
,
and
some
*NL*
flowers
.
It
seemed
to
be
all
old
nooks
and
corners
;
and
in
every
nook
*NL*
and
corner
there
was
some
queer
little
table
,
or
cupboard
,
or
bookcase
,
*NL*
or
seat
,
or
something
or
other
,
that
made
me
think
there
was
not
such
*NL*
another
good
corner
in
the
room
;
until
I
looked
at
the
next
one
,
and
*NL*
found
it
equal
to
it
,
if
not
better
.
On
everything
there
was
the
same
*NL*
air
of
retirement
and
cleanliness
that
marked
the
house
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
tapped
at
a
door
in
a
corner
of
the
panneled
wall
,
and
a
*NL*
girl
of
about
my
own
age
came
quickly
out
and
kissed
him
.
On
her
face
,
I
*NL*
saw
immediately
the
placid
and
sweet
expression
of
the
lady
whose
*NL*
picture
had
looked
at
me
down-stairs
.
It
seemed
to
my
imagination
as
if
*NL*
the
portrait
had
grown
womanly
,
and
the
original
remained
a
child
.
*NL*
Although
her
face
was
quite
bright
and
happy
,
there
was
a
tranquillity
*NL*
about
it
,
and
about
her
--
a
quiet
,
good
,
calm
spirit
--
that
I
never
have
*NL*
forgotten
;
that
I
never
shall
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
his
little
housekeeper
,
his
daughter
Agnes
,
Mr.
Wickfield
said
.
*NL*
When
I
heard
how
he
said
it
,
and
saw
how
he
held
her
hand
,
I
guessed
*NL*
what
the
one
motive
of
his
life
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
little
basket-trifle
hanging
at
her
side
,
with
keys
in
it
;
and
*NL*
looked
as
staid
and
as
discreet
a
housekeeper
as
the
old
house
could
*NL*
have
.
She
listened
to
her
father
as
he
told
her
about
me
,
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
face
;
and
when
he
had
concluded
,
proposed
to
my
aunt
that
we
*NL*
should
go
up-stairs
and
see
my
room
.
We
all
went
together
;
she
before
*NL*
us
:
and
a
glorious
old
room
it
was
,
with
more
oak
beams
,
and
diamond
*NL*
panes
;
and
the
broad
balustrade
going
all
the
way
up
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
call
to
mind
where
or
when
,
in
my
childhood
,
I
had
seen
a
*NL*
stained
glass
window
in
a
church
.
Nor
do
I
recollect
its
subject
.
But
I
*NL*
know
that
when
I
saw
her
turn
round
,
in
the
grave
light
of
the
old
*NL*
staircase
,
and
wait
for
us
,
above
,
I
thought
of
that
window
;
and
that
I
*NL*
associated
something
of
its
tranquil
brightness
with
Agnes
Wickfield
*NL*
ever
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
as
happy
as
I
was
,
in
the
arrangement
made
for
me
;
and
we
*NL*
went
down
to
the
drawing-room
again
,
well
pleased
and
gratified
.
As
she
*NL*
would
not
hear
of
staying
to
dinner
,
lest
she
should
by
any
chance
fail
*NL*
to
arrive
at
home
with
the
grey
pony
before
dark
;
and
as
I
apprehend
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
knew
her
too
well
,
to
argue
any
point
with
her
;
some
lunch
was
*NL*
provided
for
her
there
,
and
Agnes
went
back
to
her
governess
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
to
his
office
.
So
we
were
left
to
take
leave
of
one
another
*NL*
without
any
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
me
that
everything
would
be
arranged
for
me
by
Mr.
Wickfield
,
*NL*
and
that
I
should
want
for
nothing
,
and
gave
me
the
kindest
words
and
*NL*
the
best
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
in
conclusion
,
``
be
a
credit
to
yourself
,
to
me
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
,
and
Heaven
be
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
greatly
overcome
,
and
could
only
thank
her
,
again
and
again
,
and
*NL*
send
my
love
to
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
be
mean
in
anything
;
never
be
false
;
never
be
*NL*
cruel
.
Avoid
those
three
vices
,
Trot
,
and
I
can
always
be
hopeful
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
promised
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
that
I
would
not
abuse
her
kindness
or
*NL*
forget
her
admonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pony
's
at
the
door
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
I
am
off
!
Stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
she
embraced
me
hastily
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
shutting
the
door
after
her
.
At
first
I
was
startled
by
so
abrupt
a
*NL*
departure
,
and
almost
feared
I
had
displeased
her
;
but
when
I
looked
*NL*
into
the
street
,
and
saw
how
dejectedly
she
got
into
the
chaise
,
and
*NL*
drove
away
without
looking
up
,
I
understood
her
better
,
and
did
not
do
*NL*
her
that
injustice
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
five
o'clock
,
which
was
Mr.
Wickfield
's
dinner
hour
,
I
had
mustered
*NL*
up
my
spirits
again
,
and
was
ready
for
my
knife
and
fork
.
The
cloth
was
*NL*
only
laid
for
us
two
;
but
Agnes
was
waiting
in
the
drawing-room
before
*NL*
dinner
,
went
down
with
her
father
,
and
sat
opposite
to
him
at
table
.
I
*NL*
doubted
whether
he
could
have
dined
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
did
not
stay
there
,
after
dinner
,
but
came
up-stairs
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
again
:
in
one
snug
corner
of
which
,
Agnes
set
glasses
for
*NL*
her
father
,
and
a
decanter
of
port
wine
.
I
thought
he
would
have
missed
*NL*
its
usual
flavor
,
if
it
had
been
put
there
for
him
by
any
other
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
sat
,
taking
his
wine
,
and
taking
a
good
deal
of
it
,
for
two
*NL*
hours
;
while
Agnes
played
on
the
piano
,
worked
,
and
talked
to
him
and
*NL*
me
.
He
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
gay
and
cheerful
with
us
;
but
sometimes
*NL*
his
eyes
rested
on
her
,
and
he
fell
into
a
brooding
state
,
and
was
*NL*
silent
.
She
always
observed
this
quickly
,
as
I
thought
,
and
always
*NL*
roused
him
with
a
question
or
caress
.
Then
he
came
out
of
his
*NL*
meditation
,
and
drank
more
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
made
the
tea
,
and
presided
over
it
;
and
the
time
passed
away
after
*NL*
it
,
as
after
dinner
,
until
she
went
to
bed
;
when
her
father
took
her
in
*NL*
his
arms
and
kissed
her
,
and
,
she
being
gone
,
ordered
candles
in
his
*NL*
office
.
Then
I
went
to
bed
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
course
of
the
evening
I
had
rambled
down
to
the
door
,
and
a
*NL*
little
way
along
the
street
,
that
I
might
have
another
peep
at
the
old
*NL*
houses
,
and
the
grey
Cathedral
;
and
might
think
of
my
coming
through
*NL*
that
old
city
on
my
journey
,
and
of
my
passing
the
very
house
I
lived
*NL*
in
,
without
knowing
it
.
As
I
came
back
,
I
saw
Uriah
Heep
shutting
up
the
*NL*
office
;
and
feeling
friendly
towards
everybody
,
went
in
and
spoke
to
*NL*
him
,
and
at
parting
,
gave
him
my
hand
.
But
oh
,
what
a
clammy
hand
his
*NL*
was
!
as
ghostly
to
the
touch
as
to
the
sight
!
I
rubbed
mine
afterwards
,
*NL*
to
warm
it
,
_
and
to
rub
his
off
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
such
an
uncomfortable
hand
,
that
,
when
I
went
to
my
room
,
it
was
*NL*
still
cold
and
wet
upon
my
memory
.
Leaning
out
of
window
,
and
seeing
one
*NL*
of
the
faces
on
the
beam-ends
looking
at
me
sideways
,
I
fancied
it
was
*NL*
Uriah
Heep
got
up
there
somehow
,
and
shut
him
out
in
a
hurry
.

CHAPTER
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
AM
A
NEW
BOY
IN
MORE
SENSES
THAN
ONE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
after
breakfast
,
I
entered
on
school
life
again
.
I
went
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
Mr.
Wickfield
,
to
the
scene
of
my
future
studies
--
a
grave
*NL*
building
in
a
court-yard
,
with
a
learned
air
about
it
that
seemed
very
*NL*
well
suited
to
the
stray
rooks
and
jackdaws
who
came
down
from
the
*NL*
Cathedral
towers
to
walk
with
a
clerkly
bearing
on
the
grass-plot
--
and
*NL*
was
introduced
to
my
new
master
,
Doctor
Strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
looked
almost
as
rusty
,
to
my
thinking
,
as
the
tall
iron
*NL*
rails
and
gates
outside
the
house
;
and
almost
as
stiff
and
heavy
as
the
*NL*
great
stone
urns
that
flanked
them
,
and
were
set
up
,
on
the
top
of
the
*NL*
red-brick
wall
,
at
regular
distances
all
round
the
court
,
like
*NL*
sublimated
skittles
,
for
Time
to
play
at
.
He
was
in
his
library
-LRB-
I
mean
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
was
-RRB-
,
with
his
clothes
not
particularly
well
brushed
,
and
*NL*
his
hair
not
particularly
well
combed
;
his
knee-smalls
unbraced
;
his
*NL*
long
black
gaiters
unbuttoned
;
and
his
shoes
yawning
like
two
caverns
on
*NL*
the
hearth-rug
.
Turning
upon
me
a
lustreless
eye
,
that
reminded
me
of
a
*NL*
long-forgotten
blind
old
horse
who
once
used
to
crop
the
grass
,
and
*NL*
tumble
over
the
graves
,
in
Blunderstone
churchyard
,
he
said
he
was
glad
*NL*
to
see
me
:
and
then
he
gave
me
his
hand
;
which
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
*NL*
with
,
as
it
did
nothing
for
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
sitting
at
work
,
not
far
off
from
Doctor
Strong
,
was
a
very
*NL*
pretty
young
lady
--
whom
he
called
Annie
,
and
who
was
his
daughter
,
*NL*
I
supposed
--
who
got
me
out
of
my
difficulty
by
kneeling
down
to
put
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
's
shoes
on
,
and
button
his
gaiters
,
which
she
did
with
*NL*
great
cheerfulness
and
quickness
.
When
she
had
finished
,
and
we
*NL*
were
going
out
to
the
school-room
,
I
was
much
surprised
to
hear
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
,
in
bidding
her
good
morning
,
address
her
as
``
Mrs.
Strong
;
''
*NL*
and
I
was
wondering
could
she
be
Doctor
Strong
's
son
's
wife
,
or
could
*NL*
she
be
Mrs.
Doctor
Strong
,
when
Doctor
Strong
himself
unconsciously
*NL*
enlightened
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
bye
,
Wickfield
,
''
he
said
,
stopping
in
a
passage
with
his
hand
on
*NL*
my
shoulder
;
``
you
have
not
found
any
suitable
provision
for
my
wife
's
*NL*
cousin
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
No
.
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
wish
it
done
as
soon
as
it
_
can
_
be
done
,
Wickfield
,
''
said
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
,
``
for
Jack
Maldon
is
needy
,
and
idle
;
and
of
those
two
bad
*NL*
things
,
worse
things
sometimes
come
.
What
does
Doctor
Watts
say
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
looking
at
me
,
and
moving
his
head
to
the
time
of
his
quotation
,
*NL*
''
`
Satan
finds
some
mischief
still
,
for
idle
hands
to
do
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Egad
,
doctor
,
''
returned
Mr.
Wickfield
,
``
if
Doctor
Watts
knew
mankind
,
*NL*
he
might
have
written
,
with
as
much
truth
,

'
The
busy
people
achieve
their
full
share
*NL*
of
mischief
in
the
world
,
you
may
rely
upon
it
.
What
have
the
people
*NL*
been
about
,
who
have
been
the
busiest
in
getting
money
,
and
in
getting
*NL*
power
,
this
century

two

No
mischief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jack
Maldon
will
never
be
very
busy
in
getting
either
,
I
expect
,
''
said
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
,
rubbing
his
chin
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
;
``
and
you
bring
me
back
to
the
*NL*
question
,
with
an
apology
for
digressing
.
No
,
I
have
not
been
able
to
*NL*
dispose
of
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
yet
.
I
believe
,

he
said
this
with
some
*NL*
hesitation
,
``
I
penetrate
your
motive
,
and
it
makes
the
thing
more
*NL*
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
motive
,
''
returned
Dr.
Strong
,
``
is
to
make
some
suitable
provision

playfellow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Mr.
Wickfield
;
``
at
home
or
abroad

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

''
replied
the
Doctor
,
apparently
wondering
why
he
emphasised
those
*NL*
words
so
much
.
``
At
home

abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
own

said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely

the
Doctor
answered
.
``
Surely

One

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
or
other

Have
you
no
choice

asked
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
returned
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
``
for
meaning

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

returned
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bound
to
believe
you

of
course
I
do
believe

said
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
.
``
It
might
have
simplified
my
office
very
much
,
if
I
had
known
*NL*
it
before
.
But
I
confess
I
entertained
another
impression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
regarded
him
with
a
puzzled
and
doubting
look
,
which
*NL*
almost
immediately
subsided
into
a
smile
that
gave
me
great
*NL*
encouragement
;
for
it
was
full
of
amiability
and
sweetness
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
simplicity
in
it
,
and
indeed
in
his
whole
manner
,
when
the
*NL*
studious
,
pondering
frost
upon
it
was
got
through
,
very
attractive
and
*NL*
hopeful
to
a
young
scholar
like
me
.
Repeating
``
no
,
''
and
``
not
the
least
,
''
*NL*
and
other
short
assurances
to
the
same
purport
,
Doctor
Strong
jogged
on
*NL*
before
us
,
at
a
queer
,
uneven
pace
;
and
we
followed
:
Mr.
Wickfield
*NL*
looking
grave
,
I
observed
,
and
shaking
his
head
to
himself
,
without
*NL*
knowing
that
I
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
school-room
was
a
pretty
large
hall
,
on
the
quietest
side
of
the
*NL*
house
,
confronted
by
the
stately
stare
of
some
half-dozen
of
the
great
*NL*
urns
,
and
commanding
a
peep
of
an
old
secluded
garden
belonging
to
the
*NL*
Doctor
,
where
the
peaches
were
ripening
on
the
sunny
south
wall
.
There
*NL*
were
two
great
aloes
,
in
tubs
,
on
the
turf
outside
the
windows
;
the
*NL*
broad
hard
leaves
of
which
plant
-LRB-
looking
as
if
they
were
made
of
*NL*
painted
tin
-RRB-
have
ever
since
,
by
association
,
been
symbolical
to
me
of
*NL*
silence
and
retirement
.
About
five-and-twenty
boys
were
studiously
*NL*
engaged
at
their
books
when
we
went
in
,
but
they
rose
to
give
the
Doctor
*NL*
good
morning
,
and
remained
standing
when
they
saw
Mr.
Wickfield
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
boy
,
young
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
Doctor
;
``
Trotwood
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
Adams
,
who
was
the
head-boy
,
then
stepped
out
of
his
place
and
*NL*
welcomed
me
.
He
looked
like
a
young
clergyman
,
in
his
white
cravat
,
but
*NL*
he
was
very
affable
and
good-humored
;
and
he
showed
me
my
place
,
and
*NL*
presented
me
to
the
masters
,
in
a
gentlemanly
way
that
would
have
put
me
*NL*
at
my
ease
,
if
anything
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
me
so
long
,
however
,
since
I
had
been
among
such
boys
,
or
*NL*
among
any
companions
of
my
own
age
,
except
Mick
Walker
and
Mealey
*NL*
Potatoes
,
that
I
felt
as
strange
as
ever
I
have
done
in
all
my
life
.
I
*NL*
was
so
conscious
of
having
passed
through
scenes
of
which
they
could
*NL*
have
no
knowledge
,
and
of
having
acquired
experiences
foreign
to
my
age
,
*NL*
appearance
,
and
condition
,
as
one
of
them
,
that
I
half
believed
it
was
*NL*
an
imposture
to
come
there
as
an
ordinary
little
schoolboy
.
I
had
*NL*
become
,
in
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
time
,
however
short
or
long
it
may
*NL*
have
been
,
so
unused
to
the
sports
and
games
of
boys
,
that
I
knew
I
was
*NL*
awkward
and
inexperienced
in
the
commonest
things
belonging
to
them
.
*NL*
Whatever
I
had
learnt
,
had
so
slipped
away
from
me
in
the
sordid
cares
*NL*
of
my
life
from
day
to
night
,
that
now
,
when
I
was
examined
about
what
I
*NL*
knew
,
I
knew
nothing
,
and
was
put
into
the
lowest
form
of
the
school
.
*NL*
But
,
troubled
as
I
was
,
by
my
want
of
boyish
skill
,
and
of
book-learning
*NL*
too
,
I
was
made
infinitely
more
uncomfortable
by
the
consideration
,
*NL*
that
,
in
what
I
did
know
,
I
was
much
farther
removed
from
my
companions
*NL*
than
in
what
I
did
not
.
My
mind
ran
upon
what
they
would
think
,
if
they
*NL*
knew
of
my
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
?
Was
there
*NL*
anything
about
me
which
would
reveal
my
proceedings
in
connexion
with
*NL*
the
Micawber
family
--
all
those
pawnings
,
and
sellings
,
and
suppers
--
in
*NL*
spite
of
myself
?
Suppose
some
of
the
boys
had
seen
me
coming
through
*NL*
Canterbury
,
wayworn
and
ragged
,
and
should
find
me
out
?
What
would
they
*NL*
say
,
who
made
so
light
of
money
,
if
they
could
know
how
I
had
scraped
my
*NL*
halfpence
together
,
for
the
purchase
of
my
daily
saveloy
and
beer
,
or
my
*NL*
slices
of
pudding
?
How
would
it
affect
them
,
who
were
so
innocent
of
*NL*
London
life
,
and
London
streets
,
to
discover
how
knowing
I
was
-LRB-
and
was
*NL*
ashamed
to
be
-RRB-
in
some
of
the
meanest
phases
of
both
?
All
this
ran
in
my
*NL*
head
so
much
,
on
that
first
day
at
Doctor
Strong
's
,
that
I
felt
*NL*
distrustful
of
my
slightest
look
and
gesture
;
shrunk
within
myself
*NL*
whensoever
I
was
approached
by
one
of
my
new
schoolfellows
;
and
hurried
*NL*
off
the
minute
school
was
over
,
afraid
of
committing
myself
in
my
*NL*
response
to
any
friendly
notice
or
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
such
an
influence
in
Mr.
Wickfield
's
old
house
,
that
when
*NL*
I
knocked
at
it
,
with
my
new
school-books
under
my
arm
,
I
began
to
feel
*NL*
my
uneasiness
softening
away
.
As
I
went
up
to
my
airy
old
room
,
the
*NL*
grave
shadow
of
the
staircase
seemed
to
fall
upon
my
doubts
and
fears
,
*NL*
and
to
make
the
past
more
indistinct
.
I
sat
there
,
sturdily
conning
my
*NL*
books
,
until
dinner
time
-LRB-
we
were
out
of
school
for
good
at
three
-RRB-
;
and
*NL*
went
down
,
hopeful
of
becoming
a
passable
sort
of
boy
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
was
in
the
drawing-room
,
waiting
for
her
father
,
who
was
detained
*NL*
by
some
one
in
his
office
.
She
met
me
with
her
pleasant
smile
,
and
asked
*NL*
me
how
I
liked
the
school
.
I
told
her
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
I
*NL*
hoped
;
but
I
was
a
little
strange
to
it
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
have
never
been
to
school
,
''
I
said
,
``
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
you
mean
here
,
at
your
own
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
could
n't
spare
me
to
go
anywhere
else
,
''
she
answered
,
smiling
and
*NL*
shaking
her
head
.
``
His
housekeeper
must
be
in
his
house
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
fond
of
you
,
I
am
sure
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
``
Yes
,
''
and
went
to
the
door
to
listen
for
his
coming
up
,
that
*NL*
she
might
meet
him
on
the
stairs
.
But
,
as
he
was
not
there
,
she
came
*NL*
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mama
has
been
dead
ever
since
I
was
born
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
*NL*
``
I
only
know
her
picture
,
down
stairs
.
I
saw
you
looking
at
it
*NL*
yesterday
.
Did
you
think
whose
it
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
yes
,
because
it
was
so
like
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
says
so
,
too
,
''
said
Agnes
,
pleased
.
``
Hark
!
That
's
papa
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
bright
calm
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
as
she
went
to
meet
him
,
*NL*
and
as
they
came
in
,
hand
in
hand
.
He
greeted
me
cordially
;
and
told
me
*NL*
I
should
certainly
be
happy
under
Doctor
Strong
,
who
was
one
of
the
*NL*
gentlest
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
may
be
some
,
perhaps
--
I
do
n't
know
that
there
are
--
who
abuse
his
*NL*
kindness
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
Never
be
one
of
those
,
Trotwood
,
in
*NL*
anything
.
He
is
the
least
suspicious
of
mankind
;
and
whether
that
's
a
*NL*
merit
,
or
whether
it
's
a
blemish
,
it
deserves
consideration
in
all
*NL*
dealings
with
the
Doctor
,
great
or
small
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
,
I
thought
,
as
if
he
were
weary
,
or
dissatisfied
with
*NL*
something
;
but
I
did
not
pursue
the
question
in
my
mind
,
for
dinner
was
*NL*
just
then
announced
,
and
we
went
down
and
took
the
same
seats
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
scarcely
done
so
,
when
Uriah
Heep
put
in
his
red
head
and
his
*NL*
lank
hand
at
the
door
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Mr.
Maldon
begs
the
favor
of
a
word
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
but
this
moment
quit
of
Mr.
Maldon
,
''
said
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
returned
Uriah
;
``
but
Mr.
Maldon
has
come
back
,
and
he
begs
*NL*
the
favor
of
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
held
the
door
open
with
his
hand
,
Uriah
looked
at
me
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
Agnes
,
and
looked
at
the
dishes
,
and
looked
at
the
plates
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
every
object
in
the
room
,
I
thought
,
--
yet
seemed
to
look
at
nothing
;
*NL*
he
made
such
an
appearance
all
the
while
of
keeping
his
red
eyes
*NL*
dutifully
on
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
.
It
's
only
to
say
,
on
reflection
,
''
observed
a
voice
*NL*
behind
Uriah
,
as
Uriah
's
head
was
pushed
away
,
and
the
speaker
's
*NL*
substituted
--
``
pray
excuse
me
for
this
intrusion
--
that
as
it
seems
I
have
*NL*
no
choice
in
the
matter
,
the
sooner
I
go
abroad
,
the
better
.
My
cousin
*NL*
Annie
did
say
,
when
we
talked
of
it
,
that
she
liked
to
have
her
friends
*NL*
within
reach
rather
than
to
have
them
banished
,
and
the
old
Doctor
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
Strong
,
was
that
?
''
Mr.
Wickfield
interposed
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
Strong
of
course
,
''
returned
the
other
;
``
I
call
him
the
old
*NL*
Doctor
--
it
's
all
the
same
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
do
n't
_
know
,
''
returned
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Doctor
Strong
,
''
said
the
other
--
``
Doctor
Strong
was
of
the
same
*NL*
mind
,
I
believed
.
But
as
it
appears
from
the
course
you
take
with
me
*NL*
that
he
has
changed
his
mind
,
why
there
's
no
more
to
be
said
,
except
*NL*
that
the
sooner
I
am
off
,
the
better
.
Therefore
,
I
thought
I
'd
come
back
*NL*
and
say
,
that
the
sooner
I
am
off
,
the
better
.
When
a
plunge
is
to
be
*NL*
made
into
the
water
,
it
's
of
no
use
lingering
on
the
bank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
shall
be
as
little
lingering
as
possible
,
in
your
case

Mr.
*NL*
Maldon

you
may
depend
upon
it

said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

said
the
other
.
``
Much
obliged

do
n't
want
to
look

a
gift-horse
in

mouth

not
a
gracious
thing
to
do
;
*NL*
otherwise
,
I
dare
say
,
my
cousin
Annie
could
easily
arrange
it
in
her
*NL*
own
way
.
I
suppose
Annie
would
only
have
to
say
to
the
old
Doctor

*NL*
``
Meaning

said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

returned
the
other
,
''
--
would
only
have
to

such
a

it

be
so

so

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
as

course

Mr.
Maldon

asked
Mr.
Wickfield
,
*NL*
sedately
eating
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
because
Annie
's
a
charming
young
girl

not

said
Mr.
Jack
*NL*
Maldon
,
laughing
.
``
No
offence
to
anybody
,
Mr.
Wickfield
.
I
only
mean
*NL*
that
I
suppose
some
compensation
is
fair

reasonable
,
in
that
sort
of
*NL*
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compensation

asked
Mr.
Wickfield
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
lady

sir

''
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
answered
,
laughing
.
But
appearing
to
*NL*
remark
that
Mr.
Wickfield
went
on
with
his
dinner
in
the
same
sedate
,
*NL*
immoveable
manner
,
and
that
there
was
no
hope
of
making
him
relax
a
*NL*
muscle
of
his
face
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
I
have
said
what
I
came
back
to
say
,
and
,
with
another
apology
*NL*
for
this
intrusion
,
I
may
take
myself
off
.
Of
course
I
shall
observe
*NL*
your
directions
,
in
considering
the
matter
as
one
to
be
arranged
between
*NL*
you
and
me
solely
,
and
not
to
be
referred
to
,
up
at
the
Doctor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
dined
?
''
asked
Mr.
Wickfield
,
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
towards
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
`
ee
.
I
am
going
to
dine
,
''
said
Mr.
Maldon
,
``
with
my
cousin
Annie
.
*NL*
Good
bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
,
without
rising
,
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
as
he
went
*NL*
out
.
He
was
rather
a
shallow
sort
of
young
gentleman
,
I
thought
,
with
a
*NL*
handsome
face
,
a
rapid
utterance
,
and
a
confident
,
bold
air
.
And
this
*NL*
was
the
first
I
ever
saw
of
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
;
whom
I
had
not
expected
to
*NL*
see
so
soon
,
when
I
heard
the
Doctor
speak
of
him
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
dined
,
we
went
up-stairs
again
,
where
everything
went
on
*NL*
exactly
as
on
the
previous
day
.
Agnes
set
the
glasses
and
decanters
in
*NL*
the
same
corner
,
and
Mr.
Wickfield
sat
down
to
drink
,
and
drank
a
good
*NL*
deal
.
Agnes
played
the
piano
to
him
,
sat
by
him
,
and
worked
and
talked
,
*NL*
and
played
some
games
at
dominoes
with
me
.
In
good
time
she
made
tea
;
*NL*
and
afterwards
,
when
I
brought
down
my
books
,
looked
into
them
,
and
*NL*
showed
me
what
she
knew
of
them
-LRB-
which
was
no
slight
matter
,
though
*NL*
she
said
it
was
-RRB-
,
and
what
was
the
best
way
to
learn
and
understand
*NL*
them
.
I
see
her
,
with
her
modest
,
orderly
,
placid
manner
,
and
I
hear
*NL*
her
beautiful
calm
voice
,
as
I
write
these
words
.
The
influence
for
*NL*
all
good
,
which
she
came
to
exercise
over
me
at
a
later
time
,
begins
*NL*
already
to
descend
upon
my
breast
.
I
love
little
Em
`
ly
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
love
Agnes
--
no
,
not
at
all
in
that
way
--
but
I
feel
that
there
are
*NL*
goodness
,
peace
,
and
truth
,
wherever
Agnes
is
;
and
that
the
soft
light
*NL*
of
the
colored
window
in
the
church
,
seen
long
ago
,
falls
on
her
*NL*
always
,
and
on
me
when
I
am
near
her
,
and
on
every
thing
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
having
come
for
her
withdrawal
for
the
night
,
and
she
having
*NL*
left
us
,
I
gave
Mr.
Wickfield
my
hand
,
preparatory
to
going
away
myself
.
*NL*
But
he
checked
me
and
said
:
``
Should
you
like
to
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
*NL*
or
to
go
elsewhere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
stay
''
I
answered
,
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
.
If
I
may
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
but
a
dull
life
that
we
lead
here
,
boy
,
I
am
afraid
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
dull
for
me
than
Agnes
,
sir
.
Not
dull
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Than
Agnes
,
''
he
repeated
,
walking
slowly
to
the
great
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
and
leaning
against
it
.
``
Than
Agnes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
drank
wine
that
evening
-LRB-
or
I
fancied
it
-RRB-
,
until
his
eyes
were
*NL*
bloodshot
.
Not
that
I
could
see
them
now
,
for
they
were
cast
down
,
and
*NL*
shaded
by
his
hand
;
but
I
had
noticed
them
a
little
while
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
wonder
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
whether
my
Agnes
tires
of
me
.
When
should
*NL*
I
ever
tire
of
her
!
But
that
's
different
--
that
's
quite
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
musing
--
not
speaking
to
me
;
so
I
remained
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dull
old
house
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
a
monotonous
life
;
but
I
must
have
her
*NL*
near
me
.
I
must
keep
her
near
me
.
If
the
thought
that
I
may
die
and
*NL*
leave
my
darling
,
or
that
my
darling
may
die
and
leave
me
,
comes
,
like
a
*NL*
spectre
,
to
distress
my
happiest
hours
,
and
is
only
to
be
drowned
*NL*
in
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
supply
the
word
;
but
pacing
slowly
to
the
place
where
he
had
*NL*
sat
,
and
mechanically
going
through
the
action
of
pouring
wine
from
the
*NL*
empty
decanter
,
set
it
down
and
paced
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
miserable
to
bear
,
when
she
is
here
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
would
it
*NL*
be
,
and
she
away
?
No
,
no
,
no
.
I
can
not
try
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
against
the
chimney-piece
,
brooding
so
long
that
I
could
not
*NL*
decide
whether
to
run
the
risk
of
disturbing
him
by
going
,
or
to
remain
*NL*
quietly
where
I
was
,
until
he
should
come
out
of
his
reverie
.
At
length
*NL*
he
aroused
himself
,
and
looked
about
the
room
until
his
eyes
encountered
*NL*
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
eh
?
''
he
said
,
in
his
usual
manner
,
and
as
if
he
*NL*
were
answering
something
I
had
just
said
.
``
I
am
glad
of
it
.
You
are
*NL*
company
to
us
both
.
It
is
wholesome
to
have
you
here
.
Wholesome
for
me
,
*NL*
wholesome
for
Agnes
,
wholesome
perhaps
for
all
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
it
is
for
me
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
am
so
glad
to
be
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fine
fellow
!
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
As
long
as
you
are
glad
*NL*
to
be
here
,
you
shall
stay
here
.
''
He
shook
hands
with
me
upon
it
,
and
*NL*
clapped
me
on
the
back
;
and
told
me
that
when
I
had
anything
to
do
at
*NL*
night
after
Agnes
had
left
us
,
or
when
I
wished
to
read
for
my
own
*NL*
pleasure
,
I
was
free
to
come
down
to
his
room
,
if
he
were
there
and
if
*NL*
I
desired
it
for
company
's
sake
,
and
to
sit
with
him
.
I
thanked
him
*NL*
for
his
consideration
;
and
,
as
he
went
down
soon
afterwards
,
and
I
was
*NL*
not
tired
,
went
down
too
,
with
a
book
in
my
hand
,
to
avail
myself
,
for
*NL*
half-an-hour
,
of
his
permission
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
seeing
a
light
in
the
little
round
office
,
and
immediately
feeling
*NL*
myself
attracted
towards
Uriah
Heep
,
who
had
a
sort
of
fascination
for
*NL*
me
,
I
went
in
there
instead
.
I
found
Uriah
reading
a
great
fat
book
,
*NL*
with
such
demonstrative
attention
,
that
his
lank
fore-finger
followed
up
*NL*
every
line
as
he
read
,
and
made
clammy
tracks
along
the
page
-LRB-
or
so
I
*NL*
fully
believed
-RRB-
like
a
snail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
working
late
to-night
,
Uriah
,
''
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
says
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
getting
on
the
stool
opposite
,
to
talk
to
him
more
*NL*
conveniently
,
I
observed
that
he
had
not
such
a
thing
as
a
smile
about
*NL*
him
,
and
that
he
could
only
widen
his
mouth
and
make
two
hard
creases
*NL*
down
his
cheeks
,
one
on
each
side
,
to
stand
for
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
doing
office-work
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
work
,
then
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
improving
my
legal
knowledge
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
.
``
I
*NL*
am
going
through
Tidd
's
Practice
.
Oh
,
what
a
writer
Mr.
Tidd
is
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
stool
was
such
a
tower
of
observation
,
that
as
I
watched
him
reading
*NL*
on
again
,
after
this
rapturous
exclamation
,
and
following
up
the
lines
*NL*
with
his
fore-finger
,
I
observed
that
his
nostrils
,
which
were
thin
and
*NL*
pointed
,
with
sharp
dints
in
them
,
had
a
singular
and
most
uncomfortable
*NL*
way
of
expanding
and
contracting
themselves
--
that
they
seemed
to
*NL*
twinkle
,
instead
of
his
eyes
,
which
hardly
ever
twinkled
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
are
quite
a
great
lawyer
?
''
I
said
,
after
looking
at
him
*NL*
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
Master
Copperfield
?
''
said
Uriah
.
``
Oh
,
no
!
I
'm
a
very
umble
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
fancy
of
mine
about
his
hands
,
I
observed
;
for
he
*NL*
frequently
ground
the
palms
against
each
other
as
if
to
squeeze
them
*NL*
dry
and
warm
,
besides
often
wiping
them
,
in
a
stealthy
way
,
on
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
well
aware
that
I
am
the
umblest
person
going
,
''
said
Uriah
Heep
,
*NL*
modestly
;
``
let
the
other
be
where
he
may
.
My
mother
is
likewise
a
very
*NL*
umble
person
.
We
live
in
a
numble
abode
,
Master
Copperfield
,
but
have
*NL*
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
My
father
's
former
calling
was
umble
.
He
was
a
*NL*
sexton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
now
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
partaker
of
glory
at
present
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
*NL*
Heep
.
``
But
we
have
much
to
be
thankful
for

How
much
have
I
to
be
*NL*
thankful
for
,
in
living
with
Mr.
Wickfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
Uriah
if
he
had
been
with
Mr.
Wickfield
long
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
with
him
,
going
on
four
year
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
*NL*
Uriah
;
shutting
up
his
book
,
after
carefully
marking
the
place
where
he
*NL*
had
left
off
.
``
Since
a
year
after
my
father
's
death
.
How
much
have
I
to
*NL*
be
thankful
for
,
in
that
!
How
much
have
I
to
be
thankful
for
,
in
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
's
kind
intention
to
give
me
my
articles
,
which
would
otherwise
*NL*
not
lay
within
the
umble
means
of
mother
and
self
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
when
your
articled
time
is
over
,
you
'll
be
a
regular
lawyer
,
I
*NL*
suppose
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
blessing
of
Providence
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
'll
be
a
partner
in
Mr.
Wickfield
's
business
,
one
of
these
*NL*
days
,
''
I
said
,
to
make
myself
agreeable
;
``
and
it
will
be
Wickfield
and
*NL*
Heep
,
or
Heep
late
Wickfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Uriah
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
I
am
*NL*
much
too
umble
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
certainly
did
look
uncommonly
like
the
carved
face
on
the
beam
*NL*
outside
my
window
,
as
he
sat
,
in
his
humility
,
eyeing
me
sideways
,
with
*NL*
his
mouth
widened
,
and
the
creases
in
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wickfield
is
a
most
excellent
man
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
``
If
you
have
known
him
long
,
you
know
it
,
I
am
sure
,
much
better
than
I
*NL*
can
inform
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
I
was
certain
he
was
;
but
that
I
had
not
known
him
long
*NL*
myself
,
though
he
was
a
friend
of
my
aunt
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
.
``
Your
aunt
is
a
sweet
*NL*
lady
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
way
of
writhing
when
he
wanted
to
express
enthusiasm
,
which
was
*NL*
very
ugly
;
and
which
diverted
my
attention
from
the
compliment
he
had
*NL*
paid
my
relation
,
to
the
snaky
twistings
of
his
throat
and
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sweet
lady
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
said
Uriah
Heep
.
``
She
has
a
great
*NL*
admiration
for
Miss
Agnes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
``
Yes
,
''
boldly
;
not
that
I
knew
anything
about
it
,
Heaven
forgive
*NL*
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
have
,
too
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
.
``
But
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
must
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
must
have
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
Heep
,
``
for
that
remark

*NL*
It
is
so
true

Umble
as
I
am

I
know
it
is

so
_
true

Oh

thank
you
,
*NL*
Master
Copperfield

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
writhed
himself
quite
off
his
stool
in
the
excitement
of
his
*NL*
feelings
,
and
,
being
off
,
began
to
make
arrangements
for
going
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
will
be
expecting
me
,
''
he
said
,
referring
to
a
pale
,
*NL*
inexpressive-faced
watch
in
his
pocket
,
``
and
getting
uneasy
;
for
though
*NL*
we
are
very
umble
,
Master
Copperfield
,
we
are
much
attached
to
one
*NL*
another
.
If
you
would
come
and
see
us
,
any
afternoon
,
and
take
a
cup
of
*NL*
tea
at
our
lowly
dwelling
,
mother
would
be
as
proud
of
your
company
as
I
*NL*
should
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
should
be
glad
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Uriah
,
putting
his
book
away
*NL*
upon
a
shelf
.
--
``
I
suppose
you
stop
here
,
some
time
,
Master
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
was
going
to
be
brought
up
there
,
I
believed
,
as
long
as
I
*NL*
remained
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
exclaimed
Uriah
.
``
I
should
think
_
you
_
would
come
into
the
*NL*
business
at
last
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
protested
that
I
had
no
views
of
that
sort
,
and
that
no
such
scheme
*NL*
was
entertained
in
my
behalf
by
anybody
;
but
Uriah
insisted
on
blandly
*NL*
replying
to
all
my
assurances
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
I
should
*NL*
think
you
would
,
indeed
!
''
and
,
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
,
I
should
*NL*
think
you
would
,
certainly
!
''
over
and
over
again
.
Being
,
at
last
,
ready
*NL*
to
leave
the
office
for
the
night
,
he
asked
me
if
it
would
suit
my
*NL*
convenience
to
have
the
light
put
out
;
and
on
my
answering
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
instantly
extinguished
it
.
After
shaking
hands
with
me
--
his
hand
felt
*NL*
like
a
fish
,
in
the
dark
--
he
opened
the
door
into
the
street
a
very
*NL*
little
,
and
crept
out
,
and
shut
it
,
leaving
me
to
grope
my
way
back
into
*NL*
the
house
:
which
cost
me
some
trouble
and
a
fall
over
his
stool
.
This
*NL*
was
the
proximate
cause
,
I
suppose
,
of
my
dreaming
about
him
,
for
what
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
be
half
the
night
;
and
dreaming
,
among
other
things
,
*NL*
that
he
had
launched
Mr.
Peggotty
's
house
on
a
piratical
expedition
,
*NL*
with
a
black
flag
at
the
mast-head
,
bearing
the
inscription
``
Tidd
's
*NL*
Practice
,
''
under
which
diabolical
ensign
he
was
carrying
me
and
little
*NL*
Em
`
ly
to
the
Spanish
Main
,
to
be
drowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
a
little
the
better
of
my
uneasiness
when
I
went
to
school
next
*NL*
day
,
and
a
good
deal
the
better
next
day
,
and
so
shook
it
off
by
degrees
*NL*
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
I
was
quite
at
home
,
and
happy
,
among
my
*NL*
new
companions
.
I
was
awkward
enough
in
their
games
,
and
backward
enough
*NL*
in
their
studies
;
but
custom
would
improve
me
in
the
first
respect
,
I
*NL*
hoped
,
and
hard
work
in
the
second
.
Accordingly
,
I
went
to
work
very
*NL*
hard
,
both
in
play
and
in
earnest
,
and
gained
great
commendation
.
And
,
*NL*
in
a
very
little
while
,
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
life
became
so
strange
*NL*
to
me
that
I
hardly
believed
in
it
,
while
my
present
life
grew
so
*NL*
familiar
,
that
I
seemed
to
have
been
leading
it
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
's
was
an
excellent
school
;
as
different
from
Mr.
Creakle
's
*NL*
as
good
is
from
evil
.
It
was
very
gravely
and
decorously
ordered
,
and
on
*NL*
a
sound
system
;
with
an
appeal
,
in
everything
,
to
the
honour
and
good
*NL*
faith
of
the
boys
,
and
an
avowed
intention
to
rely
on
their
possession
*NL*
of
those
qualities
unless
they
proved
themselves
unworthy
of
it
,
which
*NL*
worked
wonders
.
We
all
felt
that
we
had
a
part
in
the
management
of
the
*NL*
place
,
and
in
sustaining
its
character
and
dignity
.
Hence
,
we
soon
*NL*
became
warmly
attached
to
it
--
I
am
sure
I
did
for
one
,
and
I
never
knew
,
*NL*
in
all
my
time
,
of
any
other
boy
being
otherwise
--
and
learnt
with
a
good
*NL*
will
,
desiring
to
do
it
credit
.
We
had
noble
games
out
of
hours
,
and
*NL*
plenty
of
liberty
;
but
even
then
,
as
I
remember
,
we
were
well
spoken
of
*NL*
in
the
town
,
and
rarely
did
any
disgrace
,
by
our
appearance
or
manner
,
*NL*
to
the
reputation
of
Doctor
Strong
and
Doctor
Strong
's
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
higher
scholars
boarded
in
the
Doctor
's
house
,
and
through
*NL*
them
I
learnt
,
at
second
hand
,
some
particulars
of
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
history
--
as
how
he
had
not
yet
been
married
twelve
months
to
the
*NL*
beautiful
young
lady
I
had
seen
in
the
study
,
whom
he
had
married
for
*NL*
love
;
as
she
had
not
a
sixpence
,
and
had
a
world
of
poor
relations
-LRB-
so
*NL*
our
fellows
said
-RRB-
ready
to
swarm
the
Doctor
out
of
house
and
home
.
*NL*
Also
,
how
the
Doctor
's
cogitating
manner
was
attributable
to
his
being
*NL*
always
engaged
in
looking
out
for
Greek
roots
;
which
,
in
my
innocence
*NL*
and
ignorance
,
I
supposed
to
be
a
botanical
furor
on
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
part
,
especially
as
he
always
looked
at
the
ground
when
he
walked
*NL*
about
--
until
I
understood
that
they
were
roots
of
words
,
with
a
view
to
*NL*
a
new
Dictionary
,
which
he
had
in
contemplation
.
Adams
,
our
head-boy
,
*NL*
who
had
a
turn
for
mathematics
,
had
made
a
calculation
,
I
was
informed
,
*NL*
of
the
time
this
Dictionary
would
take
in
completing
,
on
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
plan
,
and
at
the
Doctor
's
rate
of
going
.
He
considered
that
it
might
be
*NL*
done
in
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty-nine
years
,
counting
from
*NL*
the
Doctor
's
last
,
or
sixty-second
,
birthday
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Doctor
himself
was
the
idol
of
the
whole
school
:
and
it
must
*NL*
have
been
a
badly
composed
school
if
he
had
been
anything
else
,
for
he
*NL*
was
the
kindest
of
men
;
with
a
simple
faith
in
him
that
might
have
*NL*
touched
the
stone
hearts
of
the
very
urns
upon
the
wall
.
As
he
walked
up
*NL*
and
down
that
part
of
the
court-yard
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
*NL*
with
the
stray
rooks
and
jackdaws
looking
after
him
with
their
heads
*NL*
cocked
slyly
,
as
if
they
knew
how
much
more
knowing
they
were
in
worldly
*NL*
affairs
than
he
,
if
any
sort
of
vagabond
could
only
get
near
enough
to
*NL*
his
creaking
shoes
to
attract
his
attention
to
one
sentence
of
a
tale
of
*NL*
distress
,
that
vagabond
was
made
for
the
next
two
days
.
It
was
so
*NL*
notorious
in
the
house
,
that
the
masters
and
head-boys
took
pains
to
cut
*NL*
these
marauders
off
at
angles
,
and
to
get
out
of
windows
,
and
turn
them
*NL*
out
of
the
court-yard
,
before
they
could
make
the
Doctor
aware
of
their
*NL*
presence
;
which
was
sometimes
happily
effected
within
a
few
yards
of
*NL*
him
,
without
his
knowing
anything
of
the
matter
,
as
he
jogged
to
and
*NL*
fro
.
Outside
his
own
domain
,
and
unprotected
,
he
was
a
very
sheep
for
*NL*
the
shearers
.
He
would
have
taken
his
gaiters
off
his
legs
,
to
give
*NL*
away
.
In
fact
,
there
was
a
story
current
among
us
-LRB-
I
have
no
idea
,
and
*NL*
never
had
,
on
what
authority
,
but
I
have
believed
it
for
so
many
years
*NL*
that
I
feel
quite
certain
it
is
true
-RRB-
,
that
on
a
frosty
day
,
one
winter
*NL*
time
,
he
actually
did
bestow
his
gaiters
on
a
beggar-woman
,
who
*NL*
occasioned
some
scandal
in
the
neighbourhood
by
exhibiting
a
fine
infant
*NL*
from
door
to
door
,
wrapped
in
those
garments
,
which
were
universally
*NL*
recognised
,
being
as
well
known
in
the
vicinity
as
the
Cathedral
.
The
*NL*
legend
added
that
the
only
person
who
did
not
identify
them
was
the
*NL*
Doctor
himself
,
who
,
when
they
were
shortly
afterwards
displayed
at
the
*NL*
door
of
a
little
second-hand
shop
of
no
very
good
repute
,
where
such
*NL*
things
were
taken
in
exchange
for
gin
,
was
more
than
once
observed
to
*NL*
handle
them
approvingly
,
as
if
admiring
some
curious
novelty
in
the
*NL*
pattern
,
and
considering
them
an
improvement
on
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
pleasant
to
see
the
Doctor
with
his
pretty
young
wife
.
He
*NL*
had
a
fatherly
,
benignant
way
of
showing
his
fondness
for
her
,
which
*NL*
seemed
in
itself
to
express
a
good
man
.
I
often
saw
them
walking
in
the
*NL*
garden
where
the
peaches
were
,
and
I
sometimes
had
a
nearer
observation
*NL*
of
them
in
the
study
or
the
parlor
.
She
appeared
to
me
to
take
great
*NL*
care
of
the
Doctor
,
and
to
like
him
very
much
,
though
I
never
thought
*NL*
her
vitally
interested
in
the
Dictionary
:
some
cumbrous
fragments
of
*NL*
which
work
the
Doctor
always
carried
in
his
pockets
,
and
in
the
lining
*NL*
of
his
hat
,
and
generally
seemed
to
be
expounding
to
her
as
they
walked
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
a
good
deal
of
Mrs.
Strong
,
both
because
she
had
taken
a
liking
*NL*
for
me
on
the
morning
of
my
introduction
to
the
Doctor
,
and
was
always
*NL*
afterwards
kind
to
me
,
and
interested
in
me
;
and
because
she
was
very
*NL*
fond
of
Agnes
,
and
was
often
backwards
and
forwards
at
our
house
.
There
*NL*
was
a
curious
constraint
between
her
and
Mr.
Wickfield
,
I
thought
-LRB-
of
*NL*
whom
she
seemed
to
be
afraid
-RRB-
,
that
never
wore
off
.
When
she
came
there
*NL*
of
an
evening
,
she
always
shrunk
from
accepting
his
escort
home
,
and
ran
*NL*
away
with
me
instead
.
And
sometimes
,
as
we
were
running
gaily
across
the
*NL*
Cathedral
yard
together
,
expecting
to
meet
nobody
,
we
would
meet
Mr.
*NL*
Jack
Maldon
,
who
was
always
surprised
to
see
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Strong
's
mama
was
a
lady
I
took
great
delight
in
.
Her
name
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Markleham
;
but
our
boys
used
to
call
her
the
Old
Soldier
,
on
account
of
*NL*
her
generalship
,
and
the
skill
with
which
she
marshalled
great
forces
of
*NL*
relations
against
the
Doctor
.
She
was
a
little
,
sharp-eyed
woman
,
who
*NL*
used
to
wear
,
when
she
was
dressed
,
one
unchangeable
cap
,
ornamented
*NL*
with
some
artificial
flowers
,
and
two
artificial
butterflies
supposed
to
*NL*
be
hovering
above
the
flowers
.
There
was
a
superstition
among
us
that
*NL*
this
cap
had
come
from
France
,
and
could
only
originate
in
the
*NL*
workmanship
of
that
ingenious
nation
:
but
all
I
certainly
know
about
it
,
*NL*
is
,
that
it
always
made
its
appearance
of
an
evening
,
wheresoever
Mrs.
*NL*
Markleham
made
_
her
_
appearance
;
that
it
was
carried
about
to
friendly
*NL*
meetings
in
a
Hindoo
basket
;
that
the
butterflies
had
the
gift
of
*NL*
trembling
constantly
;
and
that
they
improved
the
shining
hours
at
Doctor
*NL*
Strong
's
expense
,
like
busy
bees
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
observed
the
Old
Soldier
--
not
to
adopt
the
name
disrespectfully
--
to
*NL*
pretty
good
advantage
,
on
a
night
which
is
made
memorable
to
me
by
*NL*
something
else
I
shall
relate
.
It
was
the
night
of
a
little
party
at
the
*NL*
Doctor
's
,
which
was
given
on
the
occasion
of
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
's
departure
*NL*
for
India
,
whither
he
was
going
as
a
cadet
,
or
something
of
that
kind
:
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
having
at
length
arranged
the
business
.
It
happened
to
be
*NL*
the
Doctor
's
birthday
,
too
.
We
had
had
a
holiday
,
had
made
presents
to
*NL*
him
in
the
morning
,
had
made
a
speech
to
him
through
the
head-boy
,
and
*NL*
had
cheered
him
until
we
were
hoarse
,
and
until
he
had
shed
tears
.
And
*NL*
now
,
in
the
evening
,
Mr.
Wickfield
,
Agnes
,
and
I
,
went
to
have
tea
with
*NL*
him
in
his
private
capacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
was
there
,
before
us
.
Mrs.
Strong
,
dressed
in
white
,
*NL*
with
cherry-colored
ribbons
,
was
playing
the
piano
,
when
we
went
in
;
and
*NL*
he
was
leaning
over
her
to
turn
the
leaves
.
The
clear
red
and
white
of
*NL*
her
complexion
was
not
so
blooming
and
flower-like
as
usual
,
I
thought
,
*NL*
when
she
turned
round
;
but
she
looked
very
pretty
,
wonderfully
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
forgotten
,
Doctor
,
''
said
Mrs.
Strong
's
mama
,
when
we
were
*NL*
seated
,
``
to
pay
you
the
compliments
of
the
day
--
though
they
are
,
as
you
*NL*
may
suppose
,
very
far
from
being
mere
compliments
in
my
case
.
Allow
me
*NL*
to
wish
you
many
happy
returns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
ma'am
,
''
replied
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
,
many
,
many
,
happy
returns

''
said
the
Old
Soldier
.
``
Not
only
for
*NL*
your
own
sake
,
but
for
Annie
's
,
and
John
Maldon
's
,
and
many
other
*NL*
peoples
'
.
It
seems
but
yesterday
to
me
,
John
,
when
you
were
a
little
*NL*
creature
,
a
head
shorter
than
Master
Copperfield
,
making
baby
love
to
*NL*
Annie
behind
the
gooseberry
bushes
in
the
back-garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
mama

said
Mrs.
Strong
,
``
never
mind
that
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
do
n't
be
absurd
,
''
returned
her
mother
.
``
If
you
are
to
blush
to
*NL*
hear
of
such
things
,
now
you
are
an
old
married
woman
,
when
are
you
not
*NL*
to
blush
to
hear
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
?
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
.
``
Annie
?
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
John
,
''
returned
the
Soldier
.
``
Virtually
,
an
old
married
woman

*NL*
Although
not
old
by
years
--
for
when
did
you
ever
hear
me
say
,
or
who
has
*NL*
ever
heard
me
say
,
that
a
girl
of
twenty
was
old
by
years
!

your
cousin
*NL*
is
the
wife

as
such

what
I
have
described
her

It
*NL*
is
well
for
you
,
John
,
that
your
cousin
is
the
wife
of
the

You

have
found
in
him
an
influential

kind
friend

who
will
be
kinder
*NL*
yet
,
I
venture
to
predict
,
if
you
deserve
it

I
have
no
false
pride

I
*NL*
never
hesitate
to
admit

frankly

that
there
are
some
members

our

family
who
want

You

one

your

influence
raised
up
one
for
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
,
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
,
waved
his
hand
as
if
to
make
*NL*
light
of
it
,
and
save
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
from
any
further
reminder
.
But
*NL*
Mrs.
Markleham
changed
her
chair
for
one
next
the
Doctor
's
,
and
putting
*NL*
her
fan
on
his
coat-sleeve
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

really
,
my
dear
Doctor

you
must
excuse
me
if
I
appear
to
dwell
on
*NL*
this
rather
,
because
I
feel
so
very
strongly
.
I
call
it
quite
my
*NL*
monomania
,
it
is
such
a
subject
of
mine
.
You
are
a
blessing
to
us

You
*NL*
really
are
a
Boon

you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

nonsense

said
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
beg
your
pardon

''
retorted
the
Old
Soldier
.
``
With
nobody
*NL*
present
,
but
our
dear
and
confidential
friend
Mr.
Wickfield
,
I
can
not
*NL*
consent
to
be
put
down
.
I
shall
begin
to
assert
the
privileges
of
a
*NL*
mother-in-law
,
if
you
go
on
like
that
,
and
scold
you
.
I
am
perfectly
*NL*
honest

outspoken
.
What
I
am
saying
,
is
what
I
said
when
you
first
*NL*
overpowered
me
with
surprise
--
you
remember
how
surprised
I
was
?
--
by
*NL*
proposing
for
Annie
.
Not
that
there
was
anything
so
very
much
out
of
the
*NL*
way
,
in
the
mere
act
of
the
proposal
--
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
say
*NL*
that
!

but
because
,
you
having
known
her
poor
father
,
and
having
known
*NL*
her
from
a
baby
six
months
old
,
I
had
n't
thought
of
you
in
such
a
light
*NL*
at
all
,

indeed
as
a
marrying
man
in
any
way
,

simply
that
,
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye

returned
the
Doctor
,
good-humoredly
.
``
Never
mind

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
_
do
_
mind

said
the
Old
Soldier
,
laying
her
fan
upon
his
lips

*NL*
``
I
mind
very
much

I
recal
these
things
that
I
may
be
contradicted

am
wrong

Well
!
Then
I
spoke
to
Annie
,
and
I
told
her
what
had
happened

*NL*
I
said
,
`
My

,
here
's
Doctor
Strong
has
positively
been
and
made
you
*NL*
the
subject
of
a

an
offer

Did
I
press
it
in
*NL*
the
least
?
No
.
I
said
,
`
Now
,
Annie
,
tell
me
the
truth
this
moment
;
is
*NL*
your
heart
free
?
'
`
Mama
,
'
she
said
,
crying
,
'
I
am
extremely
*NL*
young
'
--
which
was
perfectly
true
--
`
and
I
hardly
know
if
I
have
a
heart
*NL*
at
all
.
'
`
Then
,
my
dear
,
'
I
said
,
`
you
may
rely
upon
it
,
it
's
free
.
At
*NL*
all
events
,
my
love
,
'
said
I
,
`
Doctor
Strong
is
in
an
agitated
state
of
*NL*
mind
,
and
must
be
answered
.
He
can
not
be
kept
in
his
present
state
of
*NL*
suspense
.
'
`
Mama
,
'
said
Annie
,
still
crying
,
`
would
he
be
unhappy
*NL*
without
me
?
If
he
would
,
I
honor
and
respect
him
so
much
,
that
I
think
I
*NL*
will
have
him
.
'
So
it
was
settled
.
And
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
I
said
*NL*
to
Annie
,
`
Annie
,
Doctor
Strong
will
not
only
be
your
husband
,
but
he
*NL*
will
represent
your
late
father
:
he
will
represent
the
head
of
our
*NL*
family
,
he
will
represent
the
wisdom
and
station
,
and
I
may
say
the
*NL*
means
,
of
our
family
;
and
will
be
,
in
short
,
a
Boon
to
it
.
'
I
used
the
*NL*
word
at
the
time
,
and
I
have
used
it
again
,
to-day
.
If
I
have
any
merit
,
*NL*
it
is
consistency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
daughter
had
sat
quite
silent
and
still
during
this
speech
,
with
her
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
;
her
cousin
standing
near
her
,
and
looking
on
*NL*
the
ground
too
.
She
now
said
very
softly
,
in
a
trembling
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mama
,
I
hope
you
have
finished
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
Annie
,
''
returned
the
Soldier
,
``
I
have
not
quite
finished
.
*NL*
Since
you
ask
me
,
my
love
,
I
reply
that
I
have
_
not
_
.
I
complain
that
*NL*
you
really
are
a
little
unnatural
towards
your
own
family
;
and
,
as
it
is
*NL*
of
no
use
complaining
to
you
,
I
mean
to
complain
to
your
husband
.
Now
,
*NL*
my
dear
Doctor
,
do
look
at
that
silly
wife
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Doctor
turned
his
kind
face
,
with
its
smile
of
simplicity
and
*NL*
gentleness
,
towards
her
,
she
drooped
her
head
more
.
I
noticed
that
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
looked
at
her
steadily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
happened
to
say
to
that
naughty
thing
,
the
other
day
,
''
pursued
*NL*
her
mother
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
fan
at
her
,
playfully
,
``
that
there
*NL*
was
a
family
circumstance
she
might
mention
to
you
--
indeed
,
I
think
,
was
*NL*
bound
to
mention
--
she
said
,
that
to
mention
it
was
to
ask
a
favor
;
and
*NL*
that
,
as
you
were
too
generous
,
and
as
for
her
to
ask
was
always
to
*NL*
have
,
she
would
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
my
dear
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
``
That
was
wrong
.
It
robbed
me
of
a
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Almost
the
very
words
I
said
to
her
!
''
exclaimed
her
mother
.
``
Now
*NL*
really
,
another
time
,
when
I
know
what
she
would
tell
you
but
for
this
*NL*
reason
,
and
wo
n't
,
I
have
a
great
mind
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
to
tell
you
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
,
''
returned
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
will
!
''
said
the
Old
Soldier
.
``
That
's
a
bargain
.
''
And
*NL*
having
,
I
suppose
,
carried
her
point
,
she
tapped
the
Doctor
's
hand
*NL*
several
times
with
her
fan
-LRB-
which
she
kissed
first
-RRB-
,
and
returned
*NL*
triumphantly
to
her
former
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
more
company
coming
in
,
among
whom
were
the
two
masters
and
Adams
,
*NL*
the
talk
became
general
;
and
it
naturally
turned
on
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
,
and
*NL*
his
voyage
,
and
the
country
he
was
going
to
,
and
his
various
plans
and
*NL*
prospects
.
He
was
to
leave
that
night
,
after
supper
,
in
a
postchaise
,
*NL*
for
Gravesend
;
where
the
ship
,
in
which
he
was
to
make
the
voyage
,
lay
;
*NL*
and
was
to
be
gone
--
unless
he
came
home
on
leave
,
or
for
his
health
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
many
years
.
I
recollect
it
was
settled
by
general
consent
*NL*
that
India
was
quite
a
misrepresented
country
,
and
had
nothing
*NL*
objectionable
in
it
,
but
a
tiger
or
two
,
and
a
little
heat
in
the
warm
*NL*
part
of
the
day
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
looked
on
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
as
a
*NL*
modern
Sinbad
,
and
pictured
him
the
bosom
friend
of
all
the
Rajahs
in
*NL*
the
east
,
sitting
under
canopies
,
smoking
curly
golden
pipes
--
a
mile
*NL*
long
,
if
they
could
be
straightened
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Strong
was
a
very
pretty
singer
:
as
I
knew
,
who
often
heard
her
*NL*
singing
by
herself
.
But
,
whether
she
was
afraid
of
singing
before
*NL*
people
,
or
was
out
of
voice
that
evening
,
it
was
certain
that
she
*NL*
could
n't
sing
at
all
.
She
tried
a
duet
,
once
,
with
her
cousin
Maldon
,
*NL*
but
could
not
so
much
as
begin
;
and
afterwards
,
when
she
tried
to
sing
*NL*
by
herself
,
although
she
began
sweetly
,
her
voice
died
away
on
a
sudden
,
*NL*
and
left
her
quite
distressed
,
with
her
head
hanging
down
over
the
keys
.
*NL*
The
good
Doctor
said
she
was
nervous
,
and
,
to
relieve
her
,
proposed
a
*NL*
round
game
at
cards
;
of
which
he
knew
as
much
as
of
the
art
of
playing
*NL*
the
trombone
.
But
I
remarked
that
the
Old
Soldier
took
him
into
custody
*NL*
directly
,
for
her
partner
;
and
instructed
him
,
as
the
first
preliminary
*NL*
of
initiation
,
to
give
her
all
the
silver
he
had
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
merry
game
,
not
made
the
less
merry
by
the
Doctor
's
mistakes
,
*NL*
of
which
he
committed
an
innumerable
quantity
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
watchfulness
of
the
butterflies
,
and
to
their
great
aggravation
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Strong
had
declined
to
play
,
on
the
ground
of
not
feeling
very
well
;
and
*NL*
her
cousin
Maldon
had
excused
himself
because
he
had
some
packing
to
do
.
*NL*
When
he
had
done
it
,
however
,
he
returned
,
and
they
sat
together
,
*NL*
talking
,
on
the
sofa
.
From
time
to
time
she
came
and
looked
over
the
*NL*
Doctor
's
hand
,
and
told
him
what
to
play
.
She
was
very
pale
,
as
she
bent
*NL*
over
him
,
and
I
thought
her
finger
trembled
as
she
pointed
out
the
*NL*
cards
;
but
the
Doctor
was
quite
happy
in
her
attention
,
and
took
no
*NL*
notice
of
this
,
if
it
were
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
supper
,
we
were
hardly
so
gay
.
Every
one
appeared
to
feel
that
a
*NL*
parting
of
that
sort
was
an
awkward
thing
,
and
that
the
nearer
it
*NL*
approached
,
the
more
awkward
it
was
.
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
tried
to
be
very
*NL*
talkative
,
but
was
not
at
his
ease
,
and
made
matters
worse
.
And
they
*NL*
were
not
improved
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
,
by
the
Old
Soldier
:
who
*NL*
continually
recalled
passages
of
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
's
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
,
however
,
who
felt
,
I
am
sure
,
that
he
was
making
everybody
*NL*
happy
,
was
well
pleased
,
and
had
no
suspicion
,
but
that
we
were
all
at
*NL*
the
utmost
height
of
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
my
dear
,
''
said
he
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
and
filling
his
glass
,
*NL*
``
it
is
past
your
cousin
Jack
's
time
,
and
we
must
not
detain
him
,
since
*NL*
time
and
tide
--
both
concerned
in
this
case
--
wait
for
no
man
.
Mr.
Jack
*NL*
Maldon
,
you
have
a
long
voyage
,
and
a
strange
country
,
before
you
;
but
*NL*
many
men
have
had
both
,
and
many
men
will
have
both
,
to
the
end
of
time
.
*NL*
The
winds
you
are
going
to
tempt
,
have
wafted
thousands
upon
thousands
*NL*
to
fortune
,
and
brought
thousands
upon
thousands
happily
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
affecting
thing
,
''
said
Mrs.
Markleham
--
``
however
it
's
viewed
,
*NL*
it
's
affecting
--
to
see
a
fine
young
man
one
has
known
from
an
infant
,
*NL*
going
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
leaving
all
he
knows
behind
,
*NL*
and
not
knowing
what
's
before
him
.
A
young
man
really
well
deserves
*NL*
constant
support
and
patronage
,
''
looking
at
the
Doctor
,
``
who
makes
such
*NL*
sacrifices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
will
go
fast
with
you
,
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
,
''
pursued
the
Doctor
,
``
and
*NL*
fast
with
all
of
us
.
Some
of
us
can
hardly
expect
,
perhaps
,
in
the
*NL*
natural
course
of
things
,
to
greet
you
on
your
return
.
The
next
best
*NL*
thing
is
to
hope
to
do
it
,
and
that
's
my
case
.
I
shall
not
weary
you
*NL*
with
good
advice
.
You
have
long
had
a
good
model
before
you
,
in
your
*NL*
cousin
Annie
.
Imitate
her
virtues
as
nearly
as
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Markleham
fanned
herself
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
Mr.
Jack
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
standing
up
;
on
which
we
all
*NL*
stood
up
.
``
A
prosperous
voyage
out
,
a
thriving
career
abroad
,
and
a
*NL*
happy
return
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
drank
the
toast
,
and
all
shook
hands
with
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
;
after
*NL*
which
he
hastily
took
leave
of
the
ladies
who
were
there
,
and
hurried
to
*NL*
the
door
,
where
he
was
received
,
as
he
got
into
the
chaise
,
with
a
*NL*
tremendous
broadside
of
cheers
discharged
by
our
boys
,
who
had
assembled
*NL*
on
the
lawn
for
the
purpose
.
Running
in
among
them
to
swell
the
ranks
,
I
*NL*
was
very
near
the
chaise
when
it
rolled
away
;
and
I
had
a
lively
*NL*
impression
made
upon
me
,
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
and
dust
,
of
having
*NL*
seen
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
rattle
past
with
an
agitated
face
,
and
something
*NL*
cherry-colored
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
another
broadside
for
the
Doctor
,
and
another
for
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
wife
,
the
boys
dispersed
,
and
I
went
back
into
the
house
,
where
I
found
*NL*
the
guests
all
standing
in
a
group
about
the
Doctor
,
discussing
how
Mr.
*NL*
Jack
Maldon
had
gone
away
,
and
how
he
had
borne
it
,
and
how
he
had
felt
*NL*
it
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
In
the
midst
of
these
remarks
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Markleham
cried
:
``
Where
's
Annie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
Annie
was
there
;
and
when
they
called
to
her
,
no
Annie
replied
.
But
*NL*
all
pressing
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
crowd
,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
,
we
*NL*
found
her
lying
on
the
hall
floor
.
There
was
great
alarm
at
first
,
until
*NL*
it
was
found
that
she
was
in
a
swoon
,
and
that
the
swoon
was
yielding
to
*NL*
the
usual
means
of
recovery
;
when
the
Doctor
,
who
had
lifted
her
head
*NL*
upon
his
knee
,
put
her
curls
aside
with
his
hand
,
and
said
,
looking
*NL*
around
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Annie
!
She
's
so
faithful
and
tender-hearted
!
It
's
the
parting
from
*NL*
her
old
playfellow
and
friend
--
her
favorite
cousin
--
that
has
done
this
.
*NL*
Ah
!
It
's
a
pity
!
I
am
very
sorry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
opened
her
eyes
,
and
saw
where
she
was
,
and
that
we
were
all
*NL*
standing
about
her
,
she
arose
with
assistance
:
turning
her
head
,
as
she
*NL*
did
so
,
to
lay
it
on
the
Doctor
's
shoulder
--
or
to
hide
it
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
which
.
We
went
into
the
drawing-room
,
to
leave
her
with
the
Doctor
and
*NL*
her
mother
;
but
she
said
,
it
seemed
,
that
she
was
better
than
she
had
*NL*
been
since
morning
,
and
that
she
would
rather
be
brought
among
us
;
so
*NL*
they
brought
her
in
,
looking
very
white
and
weak
,
I
thought
,
and
sat
her
*NL*
on
a
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
my
dear
,
''
said
her
mother
,
doing
something
to
her
dress
.
``
See
*NL*
here
!
You
have
lost
a
bow
.
Will
anybody
be
so
good
as
find
a
ribbon
;
a
*NL*
cherry-colored
ribbon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
one
she
had
worn
at
her
bosom
.
We
all
looked
for
it
--
I
myself
*NL*
looked
everywhere
,
I
am
certain
--
but
nobody
could
find
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
recollect
where
you
had
it
last
,
Annie
?
''
said
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
how
I
could
have
thought
she
looked
white
,
or
anything
but
*NL*
burning
red
,
when
she
answered
that
she
had
had
it
safe
,
a
little
while
*NL*
ago
,
she
thought
,
but
it
was
not
worth
looking
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
it
was
looked
for
again
,
and
still
not
found
.
She
*NL*
entreated
that
there
might
be
no
more
searching
;
but
it
was
still
sought
*NL*
for
,
in
a
desultory
way
,
until
she
was
quite
well
,
and
the
company
took
*NL*
their
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
very
slowly
home
,
Mr.
Wickfield
,
Agnes
,
and
I
--
Agnes
and
I
*NL*
admiring
the
moonlight
,
and
Mr.
Wickfield
scarcely
raising
his
eyes
from
*NL*
the
ground
.
When
we
,
at
last
,
reached
our
own
door
,
Agnes
discovered
*NL*
that
she
had
left
her
little
reticule
behind
.
Delighted
to
be
of
any
*NL*
service
to
her
,
I
ran
back
to
fetch
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
supper-room
where
it
had
been
left
,
which
was
deserted
*NL*
and
dark
.
But
a
door
of
communication
between
that
and
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
study
,
where
there
was
a
light
,
being
open
,
I
passed
on
there
,
to
say
*NL*
what
I
wanted
,
and
to
get
a
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
was
sitting
in
his
easy
chair
by
the
fireside
,
and
his
young
*NL*
wife
was
on
a
stool
at
his
feet
.
The
Doctor
,
with
a
complacent
smile
,
*NL*
was
reading
aloud
some
manuscript
explanation
or
statement
of
a
theory
*NL*
out
of
that
interminable
Dictionary
,
and
she
was
looking
up
at
him
.
But
,
*NL*
with
such
a
face
as
I
never
saw
.
It
was
so
beautiful
in
its
form
,
it
was
*NL*
so
ashy
pale
,
it
was
so
fixed
in
its
abstraction
,
it
was
so
full
of
a
*NL*
wild
,
sleep-walking
,
dreamy
horror
of
I
do
n't
know
what
.
The
eyes
were
*NL*
wide
open
,
and
her
brown
hair
fell
in
two
rich
clusters
on
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
on
her
white
dress
,
disordered
by
the
want
of
the
lost
*NL*
ribbon
.
Distinctly
as
I
recollect
her
look
,
I
can
not
say
of
what
it
was
*NL*
expressive
.
I
can
not
even
say
of
what
it
is
expressive
to
me
now
,
rising
*NL*
again
before
my
older
judgment
.
Penitence
,
humiliation
,
shame
,
pride
,
*NL*
love
,
and
trustfulness
--
I
see
them
all
;
and
in
them
all
,
I
see
that
*NL*
horror
of
I
do
n't
know
what
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
My
entrance
,
and
my
saying
what
I
wanted
,
roused
her
.
It
disturbed
the
*NL*
Doctor
too
,
for
when
I
went
back
to
replace
the
candle
I
had
taken
from
*NL*
the
table
,
he
was
patting
her
head
,
in
his
fatherly
way
,
and
saying
he
*NL*
was
a
merciless
drone
to
let
her
tempt
him
into
reading
on
;
and
he
would
*NL*
have
her
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
asked
him
,
in
a
rapid
,
urgent
manner
,
to
let
her
stay
--
to
let
*NL*
her
feel
assured
-LRB-
I
heard
her
murmur
some
broken
words
to
this
effect
-RRB-
*NL*
that
she
was
in
his
confidence
that
night
.
And
,
as
she
turned
again
*NL*
towards
him
,
after
glancing
at
me
as
I
left
the
room
and
went
out
at
the
*NL*
door
,
I
saw
her
cross
her
hands
upon
his
knee
,
and
look
up
at
him
with
*NL*
the
same
face
,
something
quieted
,
as
he
resumed
his
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
a
great
impression
on
me
,
and
I
remembered
it
a
long
time
*NL*
afterwards
;
as
I
shall
have
occasion
to
narrate
when
the
time
comes

CHAPTER
XVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
SOMEBODY
TURNS
UP
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
not
occurred
to
me
to
mention
Peggotty
since
I
ran
away
;
but
,
of
*NL*
course
,
I
wrote
her
a
letter
almost
as
soon
as
I
was
housed
at
Dover
,
*NL*
and
another
,
and
a
longer
letter
,
containing
all
particulars
fully
*NL*
related
,
when
my
aunt
took
me
formally
under
her
protection
.
On
my
being
*NL*
settled
at
Doctor
Strong
's
I
wrote
to
her
again
,
detailing
my
happy
*NL*
condition
and
prospects
.
I
never
could
have
derived
anything
like
the
*NL*
pleasure
from
spending
the
money
Mr.
Dick
had
given
me
,
that
I
felt
in
*NL*
sending
a
gold
half-guinea
to
Peggotty
,
per
post
,
inclosed
in
this
last
*NL*
letter
,
to
discharge
the
sum
I
had
borrowed
of
her
:
in
which
epistle
,
*NL*
not
before
,
I
mentioned
about
the
young
man
with
the
donkey-cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
communications
Peggotty
replied
as
promptly
,
if
not
as
*NL*
concisely
,
as
a
merchant
's
clerk
.
Her
utmost
powers
of
expression
-LRB-
which
*NL*
were
certainly
not
great
in
ink
-RRB-
were
exhausted
in
the
attempt
to
write
*NL*
what
she
felt
on
the
subject
of
my
journey
.
Four
sides
of
incoherent
and
*NL*
interjectional
beginnings
of
sentences
,
that
had
no
end
,
except
blots
,
*NL*
were
inadequate
to
afford
her
any
relief
.
But
the
blots
were
more
*NL*
expressive
to
me
than
the
best
composition
;
for
they
showed
me
that
*NL*
Peggotty
had
been
crying
all
over
the
paper
,
and
what
could
I
have
*NL*
desired
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
out
,
without
much
difficulty
,
that
she
could
not
take
quite
*NL*
kindly
to
my
aunt
yet
.
The
notice
was
too
short
after
so
long
a
*NL*
prepossession
the
other
way
.
We
never
knew
a
person
,
she
wrote
;
but
to
*NL*
think
that
Miss
Betsey
should
seem
to
be
so
different
from
what
she
had
*NL*
been
thought
to
be
,
was
a
Moral
!
--
that
was
her
word
.
She
was
evidently
*NL*
still
afraid
of
Miss
Betsey
,
for
she
sent
her
grateful
duty
to
her
but
*NL*
timidly
;
and
she
was
evidently
afraid
of
me
,
too
,
and
entertained
the
*NL*
probability
of
my
running
away
again
soon
:
if
I
might
judge
from
the
*NL*
repeated
hints
she
threw
out
,
that
the
coach-fare
to
Yarmouth
was
always
*NL*
to
be
had
of
her
for
the
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
me
one
piece
of
intelligence
which
affected
me
very
much
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
there
had
been
a
sale
of
the
furniture
at
our
old
home
,
and
*NL*
that
Mr.
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
gone
away
,
and
the
house
was
shut
up
,
*NL*
to
be
let
or
sold
.
God
knows
I
had
had
no
part
in
it
while
they
remained
*NL*
there
,
but
it
pained
me
to
think
of
the
dear
old
place
as
altogether
*NL*
abandoned
;
of
the
weeds
growing
tall
in
the
garden
,
and
the
fallen
*NL*
leaves
lying
thick
and
wet
upon
the
paths
.
I
imagined
how
the
winds
of
*NL*
winter
would
howl
round
it
,
how
the
cold
rain
would
beat
upon
the
*NL*
window-glass
,
how
the
moon
would
make
ghosts
on
the
walls
of
the
empty
*NL*
rooms
,
watching
their
solitude
all
night
.
I
thought
afresh
of
the
grave
*NL*
in
the
churchyard
,
underneath
the
tree
:
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
house
*NL*
were
dead
too
,
now
,
and
all
connected
with
my
father
and
mother
were
*NL*
faded
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
other
news
in
Peggotty
's
letters
.
Mr.
Barkis
was
an
*NL*
excellent
husband
,
she
said
,
though
still
a
little
near
;
but
we
all
had
*NL*
our
faults
,
and
she
had
plenty
-LRB-
though
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
they
*NL*
were
-RRB-
;
and
he
sent
his
duty
,
and
my
little
bedroom
was
always
ready
for
*NL*
me
.
Mr.
Peggotty
was
well
,
and
Ham
was
well
,
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
but
*NL*
poorly
,
and
little
Em
`
ly
would
n't
send
her
love
,
but
said
that
Peggotty
*NL*
might
send
it
,
if
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
intelligence
I
dutifully
imparted
to
my
aunt
,
only
reserving
to
*NL*
myself
the
mention
of
little
Em
`
ly
,
to
whom
I
instinctively
felt
that
*NL*
she
would
not
very
tenderly
incline
.
While
I
was
yet
new
at
Doctor
*NL*
Strong
's
,
she
made
several
excursions
over
to
Canterbury
to
see
me
,
and
*NL*
always
at
unseasonable
hours
:
with
the
view
,
I
suppose
,
of
taking
me
by
*NL*
surprise
.
But
,
finding
me
well
employed
,
and
bearing
a
good
character
,
*NL*
and
hearing
on
all
hands
that
I
rose
fast
in
the
school
,
she
soon
*NL*
discontinued
these
visits
.
I
saw
her
on
a
Saturday
,
every
third
or
*NL*
fourth
week
,
when
I
went
over
to
Dover
for
a
treat
;
and
I
saw
Mr.
Dick
*NL*
every
alternate
Wednesday
,
when
he
arrived
by
stage-coach
at
noon
,
to
*NL*
stay
until
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
these
occasions
Mr.
Dick
never
travelled
without
a
leathern
*NL*
writing-desk
,
containing
a
supply
of
stationery
and
the
Memorial
;
in
*NL*
relation
to
which
document
he
had
a
notion
that
time
was
beginning
to
*NL*
press
now
,
and
that
it
really
must
be
got
out
of
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
was
very
partial
to
gingerbread
.
To
render
his
visits
the
*NL*
more
agreeable
,
my
aunt
had
instructed
me
to
open
a
credit
for
him
at
*NL*
a
cake-shop
,
which
was
hampered
with
the
stipulation
that
he
should
*NL*
not
be
served
with
more
than
one
shilling
's
-
worth
in
the
course
of
any
*NL*
one
day
.
This
,
and
the
reference
of
all
his
little
bills
at
the
county
*NL*
inn
where
he
slept
,
to
my
aunt
,
before
they
were
paid
,
induced
me
to
*NL*
suspect
that
he
was
only
allowed
to
rattle
his
money
,
and
not
to
spend
*NL*
it
.
I
found
on
further
investigation
that
this
was
so
,
or
at
least
*NL*
there
was
an
agreement
between
him
and
my
aunt
that
he
should
account
*NL*
to
her
for
all
his
disbursements
.
As
he
had
no
idea
of
deceiving
her
,
*NL*
and
always
desired
to
please
her
,
he
was
thus
made
chary
of
launching
*NL*
into
expense
.
On
this
point
,
as
well
as
on
all
other
possible
points
,
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
was
convinced
that
my
aunt
was
the
wisest
and
most
wonderful
*NL*
of
women
;
as
he
repeatedly
told
me
with
infinite
secresy
,
and
always
in
*NL*
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trotwood
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
after
imparting
this
*NL*
confidence
to
me
,
one
Wednesday
;
``
who
's
the
man
that
hides
near
our
*NL*
house
and
frightens
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frightens
my
aunt
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
nodded
.
``
I
thought
nothing
would
have
frightened
her
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
for
she
's
--
''
here
he
whispered
softly
,
``
do
n't
mention
it
--
the
wisest
*NL*
and
most
wonderful
of
women
.
''
Having
said
which
,
he
drew
back
,
to
*NL*
observe
the
effect
which
this
description
of
her
made
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
time
he
came
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
was
--
let
me
see
--
sixteen
*NL*
hundred
and
forty-nine
was
the
date
of
King
Charles
's
execution
.
I
think
*NL*
you
said
sixteen
hundred
and
forty-nine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
can
be

''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
sorely
puzzled
and
shaking
*NL*
his
head
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
am
as
old
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
in
that
year
that
the
man
appeared
,
sir
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
really
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
I
do
n't
see
how
it
can
have
been
in
that
*NL*
year
,
Trotwood
.
Did
you
get
that
date
out
of
history
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
history
never
lies
,
does
it
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
with
a
gleam
of
*NL*
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
,
sir
!
''
I
replied
,
most
decisively
.
I
was
ingenuous
and
*NL*
young
,
and
I
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
There
's
*NL*
something
wrong
,
somewhere
.
However
,
it
was
very
soon
after
the
mistake
*NL*
was
made
of
putting
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
King
Charles
's
head
into
*NL*
my
head
,
that
the
man
first
came
.
I
was
walking
out
with
Miss
Trotwood
*NL*
after
tea
,
just
at
dark
,
and
there
he
was
,
close
to
our
house

*NL*
*NL*
``
Walking
about
?

I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walking

repeated
Mr.
Dick
.
``
Let
me

N

no

no

*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
,
as
the
shortest
way
to
get
at
it
,
what
he

doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
until
he
came
up
behind

her
,
and
whispered
.
Then
she
turned
round
and
fainted
,
and
I
stood
still
*NL*
and
looked
at
him
,
and
he
walked
away
;
but
that
he
should
have
been
*NL*
hiding
ever
since
-LRB-
in
the
ground

somewhere

is
the
most

I
asked

*NL*
``

retorted
Mr.

,
nodding
his
head
gravely
.
``
Never

came
out

till
last
night

We
were
walking
last

up

behind
her
again

I
knew

``
And
did

frighten

again

``

of

said
Mr.

,
counterfeiting
that
affection

*NL*
making
his
teeth
chatter
.
``
Held

Cried

But
Trotwood

*NL*
come
here

getting
me
close
to
him

that
he
might
whisper
very
softly
;
*NL*
``

did
she
give
him
money

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

shook
his
head

as
utterly
renouncing
the
suggestion
;

replied
a
great
many
times
,
and
with
great
confidence
,
``
No
*NL*
beggar
,
no
beggar
,
no
beggar
,
sir
!
''
went
on
to
say
,
that
from
his
*NL*
window
he
had
afterwards
,
and
late
at
night
,
seen
my
aunt
give
this
*NL*
person
money
outside
the
garden
rails
in
the
moonlight
,
who
then
slunk
*NL*
away
--
into
the
ground
again
,
as
he
thought
probable
--
and
was
seen
no
*NL*
more
:
while
my
aunt
came
hurriedly
and
secretly
back
into
the
house
,
*NL*
and
had
,
even
that
morning
,
been
quite
different
from
her
usual
self
;
*NL*
which
preyed
on
Mr.
Dick
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
the
least
belief
,
in
the
outset
of
this
story
,
that
the
*NL*
unknown
was
anything
but
a
delusion
of
Mr.
Dick
's
,
and
one
of
the
line
*NL*
of
that
ill-fated
Prince
who
occasioned
him
so
much
difficulty
;
but
*NL*
after
some
reflection
I
began
to
entertain
the
question
whether
an
*NL*
attempt
,
or
threat
of
an
attempt
,
might
have
been
twice
made
to
take
*NL*
poor
Mr.
Dick
himself
from
under
my
aunt
's
protection
,
and
whether
my
*NL*
aunt
,
the
strength
of
whose
kind
feeling
towards
him
I
knew
from
*NL*
herself
,
might
have
been
induced
to
pay
a
price
for
his
peace
and
quiet
.
*NL*
As
I
was
already
much
attached
to
Mr.
Dick
,
and
very
solicitous
for
his
*NL*
welfare
,
my
fears
favored
this
supposition
;
and
for
a
long
time
his
*NL*
Wednesday
hardly
ever
came
round
,
without
my
entertaining
a
misgiving
*NL*
that
he
would
not
be
on
the
coach-box
as
usual
.
There
he
always
*NL*
appeared
,
however
,
grey-headed
,
laughing
,
and
happy
;
and
he
never
had
*NL*
anything
more
to
tell
of
the
man
who
could
frighten
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
Wednesdays
were
the
happiest
days
of
Mr.
Dick
's
life
;
they
*NL*
were
far
from
being
the
least
happy
of
mine
.
He
soon
became
known
to
*NL*
every
boy
in
the
school
;
and
though
he
never
took
an
active
part
*NL*
in
any
game
but
kite-flying
,
was
as
deeply
interested
in
all
our
*NL*
sports
as
any
one
among
us
.
How
often
have
I
seen
him
,
intent
upon
*NL*
a
match
at
marbles
or
pegtop
,
looking
on
with
a
face
of
unutterable
*NL*
interest
,
and
hardly
breathing
at
the
critical
times
!
How
often
,
at
*NL*
hare
and
hounds
,
have
I
seen
him
mounted
on
a
little
knoll
,
cheering
*NL*
the
whole
field
on
to
action
,
and
waving
his
hat
above
his
grey
head
,
*NL*
oblivious
of
King
Charles
the
Martyr
's
head
,
and
all
belonging
to
it
!
*NL*
How
many
a
summer-hour
have
I
known
to
be
but
blissful
minutes
to
him
*NL*
in
the
cricket-field
!
How
many
winter
days
have
I
seen
him
,
standing
*NL*
blue-nosed
in
the
snow
and
east
wind
,
looking
at
the
boys
going
down
*NL*
the
long
slide
,
and
clapping
his
worsted
gloves
in
rapture
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
an
universal
favorite
,
and
his
ingenuity
in
little
things
was
*NL*
transcendant
.
He
could
cut
oranges
into
such
devices
as
none
of
us
had
*NL*
an
idea
of
.
He
could
make
a
boat
out
of
anything
,
from
a
skewer
upwards
.
*NL*
He
could
turn
crampbones
into
chessmen
;
fashion
Roman
chariots
from
old
*NL*
court
cards
;
make
spoked
wheels
out
of
cotton
reels
,
and
birdcages
of
*NL*
old
wire
.
But
he
was
greatest
of
all
,
perhaps
,
in
the
articles
of
string
*NL*
and
straw
;
with
which
we
were
all
persuaded
he
could
do
anything
that
*NL*
could
be
done
by
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
's
renown
was
not
long
confined
to
us
.
After
a
few
Wednesdays
,
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
himself
made
some
inquiries
of
me
about
him
,
and
I
told
*NL*
him
all
my
aunt
had
told
me
;
which
interested
the
Doctor
so
much
that
he
*NL*
requested
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
next
visit
,
to
be
presented
to
him
.
*NL*
This
ceremony
I
performed
;
and
the
Doctor
begging
Mr.
Dick
,
whensoever
*NL*
he
should
not
find
me
at
the
coach-office
,
to
come
on
there
,
and
rest
*NL*
himself
until
our
morning
's
work
was
over
,
it
soon
passed
into
a
custom
*NL*
for
Mr.
Dick
to
come
on
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
,
if
we
were
a
little
*NL*
late
,
as
often
happened
on
a
Wednesday
,
to
walk
about
the
courtyard
,
*NL*
waiting
for
me
.
Here
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
Doctor
's
beautiful
*NL*
young
wife
-LRB-
paler
than
formerly
,
all
this
time
;
more
rarely
seen
by
me
*NL*
or
any
one
,
I
think
;
and
not
so
gay
,
but
not
less
beautiful
-RRB-
,
and
so
*NL*
became
more
and
more
familiar
by
degrees
,
until
,
at
last
,
he
would
come
*NL*
into
the
school
and
wait
.
He
always
sat
in
a
particular
corner
,
on
a
*NL*
particular
stool
,
which
was
called
``
Dick
,
''
after
him
;
here
he
would
sit
,
*NL*
with
his
grey
head
bent
forward
,
attentively
listening
to
whatever
might
*NL*
be
going
on
,
with
a
profound
veneration
for
the
learning
he
had
never
*NL*
been
able
to
acquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
veneration
Mr.
Dick
extended
to
the
Doctor
,
whom
he
thought
the
*NL*
most
subtle
and
accomplished
philosopher
of
any
age
.
It
was
long
before
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
ever
spoke
to
him
otherwise
than
bare-headed
;
and
even
when
he
*NL*
and
the
Doctor
had
struck
up
quite
a
friendship
,
and
would
walk
together
*NL*
by
the
hour
,
on
that
side
of
the
courtyard
which
was
known
among
us
as
*NL*
The
Doctor
's
Walk
,
Mr.
Dick
would
pull
off
his
hat
at
intervals
to
show
*NL*
his
respect
for
wisdom
and
knowledge
.
How
it
ever
came
about
,
that
the
*NL*
Doctor
began
to
read
out
scraps
of
the
famous
Dictionary
,
in
these
*NL*
walks
,
I
never
knew
;
perhaps
he
felt
it
all
the
same
,
at
first
,
as
*NL*
reading
to
himself
.
However
,
it
passed
into
a
custom
too
;
and
Mr.
Dick
,
*NL*
listening
with
a
face
shining
with
pride
and
pleasure
,
in
his
heart
of
*NL*
hearts
believed
the
Dictionary
to
be
the
most
delightful
book
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
think
of
them
going
up
and
down
before
those
school-room
*NL*
windows
--
the
Doctor
reading
with
his
complacent
smile
,
an
occasional
*NL*
flourish
of
the
manuscript
,
or
grave
motion
of
his
head
;
and
Mr.
Dick
*NL*
listening
,
enchained
by
interest
,
with
his
poor
wits
calmly
wandering
*NL*
God
knows
where
,
upon
the
wings
of
hard
words
--
I
think
of
it
as
one
of
*NL*
the
pleasantest
things
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
that
I
have
ever
seen
.
I
feel
*NL*
as
if
they
might
go
walking
to
and
fro
for
ever
,
and
the
world
might
*NL*
somehow
be
the
better
for
it
--
as
if
a
thousand
things
it
makes
a
noise
*NL*
about
,
were
not
one-half
so
good
for
it
,
or
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
was
one
of
Mr.
Dick
's
friends
,
very
soon
;
and
in
often
coming
to
*NL*
the
house
,
he
made
acquaintance
with
Uriah
.
The
friendship
between
*NL*
himself
and
me
increased
continually
,
and
it
was
maintained
on
this
odd
*NL*
footing
:
that
,
while
Mr.
Dick
came
professedly
to
look
after
me
as
my
*NL*
guardian
,
he
always
consulted
me
in
any
little
matter
of
doubt
that
*NL*
arose
,
and
invariably
guided
himself
by
my
advice
;
not
only
having
a
*NL*
high
respect
for
my
native
sagacity
,
but
considering
that
I
inherited
a
*NL*
good
deal
from
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Thursday
morning
,
when
I
was
about
to
walk
with
Mr.
Dick
from
the
*NL*
hotel
to
the
coach-office
before
going
back
to
school
-LRB-
for
we
had
an
*NL*
hour
's
school
before
breakfast
-RRB-
,
I
met
Uriah
in
the
street
,
who
reminded
*NL*
me
of
the
promise
I
had
made
to
take
tea
with
himself
and
his
mother
:
*NL*
adding
,
with
a
writhe
,
``
But
I
did
n't
expect
you
to
keep
it
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
,
we
're
so
very
umble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
had
not
yet
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
I
liked
Uriah
*NL*
or
detested
him
;
and
I
was
very
doubtful
about
it
still
,
as
I
stood
*NL*
looking
him
in
the
face
in
the
street
.
But
I
felt
it
quite
an
affront
to
*NL*
be
supposed
proud
,
and
said
I
only
wanted
to
be
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
that
's
all
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
,
``
and
it
really
*NL*
is
n't
our
umbleness
that
prevents
you
,
will
you
come
this
evening
?
But
*NL*
if
it
is
our
umbleness
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
mind
owning
to
it
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
;
for
we
are
well
aware
of
our
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
would
mention
it
to
Mr.
Wickfield
,
and
if
he
approved
,
as
I
had
*NL*
no
doubt
he
would
,
I
would
come
with
pleasure
.
So
,
at
six
o'clock
that
*NL*
evening
,
which
was
one
of
the
early
office
evenings
,
I
announced
myself
*NL*
as
ready
,
to
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
will
be
proud
indeed
,
''
he
said
,
as
we
walked
away
together
.
``
Or
*NL*
she
would
be
proud
,
if
it
was
n't
sinful
,
Master
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
did
n't
mind
supposing
_
I
_
was
proud
this
morning
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
no
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
returned
Uriah
.
``
Oh
,
believe
me
,
no
!
*NL*
Such
a
thought
never
came
into
my
head
!
I
should
n't
have
deemed
it
at
*NL*
all
proud
if
you
had
thought
_
us
_
too
umble
for
you
.
Because
we
are
so
*NL*
very
umble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
studying
much
law
lately
?
''
I
asked
,
to
change
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
self-denial
,
``
my
*NL*
reading
is
hardly
to
be
called
study
.
I
have
passed
an
hour
or
two
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
sometimes
,
with
Mr.
Tidd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
hard
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
hard
to
_
me
_
sometimes
,
''
returned
Uriah
.
``
But
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
he
might
be
,
to
a
gifted
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
beating
a
little
tune
on
his
chin
as
we
walked
on
,
with
the
two
*NL*
fore-fingers
of
his
skeleton
right
hand
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
expressions
,
you
see
,
Master
Copperfield
--
Latin
words
and
*NL*
terms
--
in
Mr.
Tidd
,
that
are
trying
to
a
reader
of
my
umble
*NL*
attainments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
be
taught
Latin
?
''
I
said
,
briskly
.
``
I
will
teach
it
*NL*
you
with
pleasure
,
as
I
learn
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
answered
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
I
*NL*
am
sure
it
's
very
kind
of
you
to
make
the
offer
,
but
I
am
much
too
umble
*NL*
to
accept
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
,
Uriah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
you
must
excuse
me
,
Master
Copperfield
!
I
am
greatly
*NL*
obliged
,
and
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
,
I
assure
you
;
but
I
am
far
*NL*
too
umble
.
There
are
people
enough
to
tread
upon
me
in
my
lowly
state
,
*NL*
without
my
doing
outrage
to
their
feelings
by
possessing
learning
.
*NL*
Learning
ai
n't
for
me
.
A
person
like
myself
had
better
not
aspire
.
If
he
*NL*
is
to
get
on
in
life
,
he
must
get
on
umbly
,
Master
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
his
mouth
so
wide
,
or
the
creases
in
his
cheeks
so
deep
,
as
*NL*
when
he
delivered
himself
of
these
sentiments
:
shaking
his
head
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
writhing
modestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
wrong
,
Uriah
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
dare
say
there
are
several
*NL*
things
that
I
could
teach
you
,
if
you
would
like
to
learn
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
doubt
that
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
answered
;
``
not
in
the
*NL*
least
.
But
not
being
umble
yourself
,
you
do
n't
judge
well
,
perhaps
,
for
*NL*
them
that
are
.
I
wo
n't
provoke
my
betters
with
knowledge
,
thank
you
.
I
'm
*NL*
much
too
umble
.
Here
is
my
umble
dwelling
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
entered
a
low
,
old-fashioned
room
,
walked
straight
into
from
the
*NL*
street
,
and
found
there
,
Mrs.
Heep
,
who
was
the
dead
image
of
Uriah
,
*NL*
only
short
.
She
received
me
with
the
utmost
humility
,
and
apologised
to
*NL*
me
for
giving
her
son
a
kiss
,
observing
that
,
lowly
as
they
were
,
they
*NL*
had
their
natural
affections
,
which
they
hoped
would
give
no
offence
to
*NL*
any
one
.
It
was
a
perfectly
decent
room
,
half
parlor
and
half
kitchen
,
*NL*
but
not
at
all
a
snug
room
.
The
tea-things
were
set
upon
the
table
,
and
*NL*
the
kettle
was
boiling
on
the
hob
.
There
was
a
chest
of
drawers
with
an
*NL*
escrutoire
top
,
for
Uriah
to
read
or
write
at
of
an
evening
;
there
was
*NL*
Uriah
's
blue
bag
lying
down
and
vomiting
papers
;
there
was
a
company
of
*NL*
Uriah
's
books
,
commanded
by
Mr.
Tidd
;
there
was
a
corner
cupboard
;
and
*NL*
there
were
the
usual
articles
of
furniture
.
I
do
n't
remember
that
any
*NL*
individual
object
had
a
bare
,
pinched
,
spare
look
;
but
I
do
remember
*NL*
that
the
whole
place
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perhaps
a
part
of
Mrs.
Heep
's
humility
,
that
she
still
wore
*NL*
weeds
.
Notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
time
that
had
occurred
since
Mr.
*NL*
Heep
's
decease
,
she
still
wore
weeds
.
I
think
there
was
some
compromise
*NL*
in
the
cap
;
but
otherwise
she
was
as
weedy
as
in
the
early
days
of
her
*NL*
mourning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
day
to
be
remembered
,
my
Uriah
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Heep
,
*NL*
making
the
tea
,
``
when
Master
Copperfield
pays
us
a
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
you
'd
think
so
,
mother
,
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
have
wished
father
to
remain
among
us
for
any
reason
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Heep
,
``
it
would
have
been
,
that
he
might
have
known
his
company
*NL*
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
embarrassed
by
these
compliments
;
but
I
was
sensible
,
too
,
of
*NL*
being
entertained
as
an
honored
guest
,
and
I
thought
Mrs.
Heep
an
*NL*
agreeable
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Uriah
,
''
said
Mrs.
Heep
,
``
has
looked
forward
to
this
,
sir
,
a
long
*NL*
while
.
He
had
his
fears
that
our
umbleness
stood
in
the
way
,
and
I
*NL*
joined
in
them
myself
.
Umble
we
are
,
umble
we
have
been
,
umble
we
shall
*NL*
ever
be
,
''
said
Mrs.
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
have
no
occasion
to
be
so
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
,
``
unless
you
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
retorted
Mrs.
Heep
.
``
We
know
our
station
and
are
*NL*
thankful
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
that
Mrs.
Heep
gradually
got
nearer
to
me
,
and
that
Uriah
*NL*
gradually
got
opposite
to
me
,
and
that
they
respectfully
plied
me
with
*NL*
the
choicest
of
the
eatables
on
the
table
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
particularly
choice
there
,
to
be
sure
;
but
I
took
the
will
for
the
deed
,
*NL*
and
felt
that
they
were
very
attentive
.
Presently
they
began
to
talk
*NL*
about
aunts
,
and
then
I
told
them
about
mine
;
and
about
fathers
and
*NL*
mothers
,
and
then
I
told
them
about
mine
;
and
then
Mrs.
Heep
began
to
*NL*
talk
about
fathers-in-law
,
and
then
I
began
to
tell
her
about
mine
--
but
*NL*
stopped
,
because
my
aunt
had
advised
me
to
observe
a
silence
on
that
*NL*
subject
.
A
tender
young
cork
,
however
,
would
have
had
no
more
chance
*NL*
against
a
pair
of
corkscrews
,
or
a
tender
young
tooth
against
a
pair
of
*NL*
dentists
,
or
a
little
shuttlecock
against
two
battledores
,
than
I
had
*NL*
against
Uriah
and
Mrs.
Heep
.
They
did
just
what
they
liked
with
me
;
and
*NL*
wormed
things
out
of
me
that
I
had
no
desire
to
tell
,
with
a
certainty
I
*NL*
blush
to
think
of
:
the
more
especially
as
,
in
my
juvenile
frankness
,
I
*NL*
took
some
credit
to
myself
for
being
so
confidential
,
and
felt
that
I
*NL*
was
quite
the
patron
of
my
two
respectful
entertainers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
very
fond
of
one
another
:
that
was
certain
.
I
take
it
that
had
*NL*
its
effect
upon
me
,
as
a
touch
of
nature
;
but
the
skill
with
which
the
*NL*
one
followed
up
whatever
the
other
said
,
was
a
touch
of
art
which
I
was
*NL*
still
less
proof
against
.
When
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
got
out
of
*NL*
me
about
myself
-LRB-
for
on
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
life
,
and
on
my
*NL*
journey
,
I
was
dumb
-RRB-
,
they
began
about
Mr.
Wickfield
and
Agnes
.
Uriah
*NL*
threw
the
ball
to
Mrs.
Heep
,
Mrs.
Heep
caught
it
and
threw
it
back
to
*NL*
Uriah
,
Uriah
kept
it
up
a
little
while
,
then
sent
it
back
to
Mrs.
Heep
,
*NL*
and
so
they
went
on
tossing
it
about
until
I
had
no
idea
who
had
got
it
,
*NL*
and
was
quite
bewildered
.
The
ball
itself
was
always
changing
too
.
Now
*NL*
it
was
Mr.
Wickfield
,
now
Agnes
,
now
the
excellence
of
Mr.
Wickfield
,
*NL*
now
my
admiration
of
Agnes
;
now
the
extent
of
Mr.
Wickfield
's
business
*NL*
and
resources
,
now
our
domestic
life
after
dinner
;
now
,
the
wine
that
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
took
,
the
reason
why
he
took
it
,
and
the
pity
that
it
was
*NL*
he
took
so
much
;
now
one
thing
,
now
another
,
then
everything
at
once
;
*NL*
and
all
the
time
,
without
appearing
to
speak
very
often
,
or
to
do
*NL*
anything
but
sometimes
encourage
them
a
little
,
for
fear
they
should
be
*NL*
overcome
by
their
humility
and
the
honor
of
my
company
,
I
found
myself
*NL*
perpetually
letting
out
something
or
other
that
I
had
no
business
to
let
*NL*
out
,
and
seeing
the
effect
of
it
in
the
twinkling
of
Uriah
's
dinted
*NL*
nostrils
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
begun
to
be
a
little
uncomfortable
,
and
to
wish
myself
well
out
of
*NL*
the
visit
,
when
a
figure
coming
down
the
street
passed
the
door
--
it
*NL*
stood
open
to
air
the
room
,
which
was
warm
,
the
weather
being
close
for
*NL*
the
time
of
year
--
came
back
again
,
looked
in
,
and
walked
in
,
exclaiming
*NL*
loudly
,
``
Copperfield
!
Is
it
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration

Somebody
turns
up

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
It

Mr.

It
was
Mr.

with
his
eye-glass

and
his
*NL*
walking-stick
,
and
his
shirt-collar

and
his

in
his

all
complete

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
putting
out
his
hand
,
``
this
is
*NL*
indeed
a
meeting
which
is
calculated
to
impress

and
uncertainty
of
all
human

in
short
,
it
is
a
most
*NL*
extraordinary
meeting

Walking

reflecting
upon

something
turning
up

which
I
am
at

I
find
a

valued

up

is
connected

with

most

period

I
may

,
with
the
turning

point
of
my
existence

Copperfield

you
do

*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not

--
I
really
can_not

say

that
I
was
glad
to
see
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
there
;
but
I
was
glad
to
see
him
too
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
heartily
,
*NL*
inquiring
how
Mrs.
Micawber
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
waving
his
hand
as
of
old
,
and
settling
*NL*
his
chin
in
his
shirt-collar
.
``
She
is
tolerably
convalescent
.
The

*NL*
no
longer
derive
their

said
*NL*
Mr.

,
in
one
of
his
bursts
of
confidence
,
``
they
are
weaned

*NL*
Mrs.

at

my

She
will
be
*NL*
rejoiced

Copperfield
,
to
renew
her
acquaintance

one
who
has
proved

himself
in
all
respects
a
worthy
minister
at
the
sacred
altar
of

friendship

*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
should
be
delighted
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good

''
said
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
then
smiled
,
settled
his
chin
again
,
and
looked
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
discovered
my
friend
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
genteelly
,
*NL*
and
without
addressing
himself
particularly
to
any
one
,
``
not
in
*NL*
solitude
,
but
partaking
of
a
social
meal
in
company
with
a
widow

one
who
is
apparently
her
offspring

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
in
another
of
his
bursts
of
confidence
,
``
her
son

I
shall
esteem
it
an
*NL*
honor
to
be
presented

*NL*
*NL*
I
could
do
no
less
,
under
these
circumstances
,
than
make
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
known
to
Uriah
Heep
and
his
mother
;
which
I
accordingly
did
.
As
they
*NL*
abased
themselves
before
him
,
Mr.
Micawber
took
a
seat
,
and
waved
his
*NL*
hand
in
his
most
courtly
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
friend
of
my
friend
Copperfield

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
has
a

personal
claim
upon

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
too
umble

said
Mrs.

,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Mr.

,
with
a
bow
,
``
you
are

*NL*
what

you
doing

Still

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
excessively
anxious
to
get
Mr.
Micawber
away
;
and
replied
,
with
my
*NL*
hat
in
my
hand
,
and
a
very
red
face
I
have
no
doubt
,
that
I
was
a
pupil
*NL*
at
Doctor
Strong
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pupil

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
``
I
am
extremely
*NL*
happy
to
hear
it

Although
a
mind
like

to
*NL*
Uriah
and
Mrs.

--
``
does
not
require
that
cultivation

without
*NL*
his

it

require

it
is
a
rich
*NL*
soil
teeming
with
latent
vegetation

in
short
,

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
smiling
,
in
another
burst
of
confidence
,
``
it
is
an
intellect
capable
of
*NL*
getting
up
the
classics
to
any
extent

''
*NL*
*NL*
Uriah
,
with
his
long
hands
slowly
twining
over
one
another
,
made
a
*NL*
ghastly
writhe
from
the
waist
upwards
,
to
express
his
concurrence
in
*NL*
this
estimation
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
and
see
Mrs.
Micawber

I
said
,
to
get
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
do
her
that
favor

replied
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
rising
.
``
I
have
no
scruple
in
saying

in
the
presence

that
I
am
a
man
who
has
,
for
some
years
,
contended
against
the
*NL*
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulties
,
''
I
knew
he
was
certain
to
say
*NL*
something
of
this
kind
;
he
always
would
be
so
boastful
about
his
*NL*
difficulties
.
``
Sometimes
I
have
risen
superior
to
my
difficulties

*NL*
Sometimes
my
difficulties
have

in

have
floored
me

There
have
*NL*
been
times
when
I
have
administered
a
succession
of
facers
to
them
;
*NL*
there
have
been
times
when
they
have
been
too
many
for
me
,
and
I
have
*NL*
given
in

said
to
Mrs.
Micawber

the
words
of
Cato

Plato

well

all
up

can
show
fight
no
more

But
at
no
*NL*
time
of
my
life

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
have
I
enjoyed
a
higher
degree
of
*NL*
satisfaction
than
in
pouring
my
griefs
-LRB-
if
I
may
describe
difficulties
,
*NL*
chiefly
arising
out
of
warrants
of
attorney
and
promissory
notes
at
two
*NL*
and
four
months
,
by
that
word
-RRB-
into
the
bosom
of
my
friend
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
closed
this
handsome
tribute
by
saying
,
``
Mr.
Heep
!
Good
*NL*
evening
.
Mrs.
Heep
!
Your
servant
,
''
and
then
walking
out
with
me
in
his
*NL*
most
fashionable
manner
,
making
a
good
deal
of
noise
on
the
pavement
*NL*
with
his
shoes
,
and
humming
a
tune
as
we
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
inn
where
Mr.
Micawber
put
up
,
and
he
occupied
a
little
*NL*
room
in
it
,
partitioned
off
from
the
commercial
room
,
and
strongly
*NL*
flavored
with
tobacco
smoke
.
I
think
it
was
over
the
kitchen
,
because
a
*NL*
warm
greasy
smell
appeared
to
come
up
through
the
chinks
in
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
flabby
perspiration
on
the
walls
.
I
know
it
was
near
the
*NL*
bar
,
on
account
of
the
smell
of
spirits
and
gingling
of
glasses
.
Here
,
*NL*
recumbent
on
a
small
sofa
,
underneath
a
picture
of
a
race-horse
,
with
*NL*
her
head
close
to
the
fire
,
and
her
feet
pushing
the
mustard
off
the
*NL*
dumb-waiter
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
was
Mrs.
Micawber
,
to
whom
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
entered
first
,
saying
,
``
My
dear
,
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
a
*NL*
pupil
of
Doctor
Strong
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
noticed
,
by-the-by
,
that
although
Mr.
Micawber
was
just
as
much
*NL*
confused
as
ever
about
my
age
and
standing
,
he
always
remembered
,
as
a
*NL*
genteel
thing
,
that
I
was
a
pupil
of
Doctor
Strong
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
was
amazed
,
but
very
glad
to
see
me
.
I
was
very
glad
to
*NL*
see
her
too
,
and
after
an
affectionate
greeting
on
both
sides
,
sat
down
*NL*
on
the
small
sofa
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``

ma'am
,
''
I
said
to
Mrs.
Micawber
,
as
he
*NL*
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
''
she
replied
,
``
we
went
to
Plymouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
on
the
spot
,
''
I
hinted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
To
be
on
the
spot
.
But
,
the
truth
is
,
*NL*
talent
is
not
wanted
in
the
Custom
House
.
The
local
influence
of
my
*NL*
family
was
quite
unavailing
to
obtain
any
employment
in
that
department
,
*NL*
for
a
man
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
abilities
.
They
would
rather
_
not
_
have
a
*NL*
man
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
abilities
.
He
would
only
show
the
deficiency
of
*NL*
the
others
.
Apart
from
which
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
I
will
not
disguise
*NL*
from
you
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
that
when
that
branch
of
my
family
*NL*
which
is
settled
in
Plymouth
became
aware
that
Mr.
Micawber
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
myself
,
and
by
little
Wilkins
and
his
sister
,
and
by
the
*NL*
twins
,
they
did
not
receive
him
with
that
ardor
which
he
might
have
*NL*
expected
,
being
so
newly
released
from
captivity
.
In
fact
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
lowering
her
voice
,
--
``
this
is
between
ourselves
--
our
reception
*NL*
was
cool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
It
is
truly
painful
to
contemplate
mankind
*NL*
in
such
an
aspect
,
Master
Copperfield
,
but
our
reception
was
,
decidedly
,
*NL*
cool
.
There
is
no
doubt
about
it
.
In
fact
,
that
branch
of
my
family
*NL*
which
is
settled
in
Plymouth
became
quite
personal
to
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
before
we
had
been
there
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
and
thought
,
that
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
so
it
was
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
Under
such
circumstances
,
*NL*
what
could
a
man
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
spirit
do
?
But
one
obvious
course
was
*NL*
left
.
To
borrow
,
of
that
branch
of
my
family
,
the
money
to
return
to
*NL*
London
,
and
to
return
at
any
sacrifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
all
came
back
again
,
ma'am
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
all
came
back
again
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
Since
then
,
I
have
*NL*
consulted
other
branches
of
my
family
on
the
course
which
it
is
most
*NL*
expedient
for
Mr.
Micawber
to
take
--
for
I
maintain
that
he
must
take
*NL*
some
course
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
argumentatively
.
*NL*
``
It
is
clear
that
a
family
of
six
,
not
including
a
domestic
,
can
not
live
*NL*
upon
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
ma'am
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
opinion
of
those
other
branches
of
my
family
,
''
pursued
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
``
is
,
that
Mr.
Micawber
should
immediately
turn
his
attention
*NL*
to
coals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
coals
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
To
the
coal
trade
.
Mr.
Micawber
was
*NL*
induced
to
think
,
on
inquiry
,
that
there
might
be
an
opening
for
a
man
*NL*
of
his
talent
in
the
Medway
Coal
Trade
.
Then
,
as
Mr.
Micawber
very
*NL*
properly
said
,
the
first
step
to
be
taken
clearly
was
,
to
come
and
_
see
_
*NL*
the
Medway
.
Which
we
came
and
saw
.
I
say
`
we
,
'
Master
Copperfield
;
for
I
*NL*
never
will
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
with
emotion
,
``
I
never
will
desert
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
murmured
my
admiration
and
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
came
,
''
repeated
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
and
saw
the
Medway
.
My
opinion
of
*NL*
the
coal
trade
on
that
river
,
is
,
that
it
may
require
talent
,
but
that
*NL*
it
certainly
requires
capital
.
Talent
,
Mr.
Micawber
has
;
capital
,
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
has
not
.
We
saw
,
I
think
,
the
greater
part
of
the
Medway
;
and
*NL*
that
is
my
individual
conclusion
.
Being
so
near
here
,
Mr.
Micawber
was
*NL*
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
rash
not
to
come
on
,
and
see
the
Cathedral
.
*NL*
Firstly
,
on
account
of
its
being
so
well
worth
seeing
,
and
our
never
*NL*
having
seen
it
;
and
secondly
,
on
account
of
the
great
probability
of
*NL*
something
turning
up
in
a
cathedral
town
.
We
have
been
here
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
``
three
days
.
Nothing
has
,
as
yet
,
turned
up
;
and
it
may
not
*NL*
surprise
you
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
so
much
as
it
would
a
*NL*
stranger
,
to
know
that
we
are
at
present
waiting
for
a
remittance
from
*NL*
London
,
to
discharge
our
pecuniary
obligations
at
this
hotel
.
Until
the
*NL*
arrival
of
that
remittance
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
with
much
feeling
,
``
I
*NL*
am
cut
off
from
my
home
-LRB-
I
allude
to
lodgings
in
Pentonville
-RRB-
,
from
my
*NL*
boy
and
girl
,
and
from
my
twins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
utmost
sympathy
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
in
this
anxious
*NL*
extremity
,
and
said
as
much
to
Mr.
Micawber
,
who
now
returned
:
adding
*NL*
that
I
only
wished
I
had
money
enough
,
to
lend
them
the
amount
they
*NL*
needed
.
Mr.
Micawber
's
answer
expressed
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
said
,
shaking
hands
with
me
,
``
Copperfield
,
you
are
a
true
friend
;
but
*NL*
when
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
no
man
is
without
a
friend
who
is
*NL*
possessed
of
shaving
materials
.
''
At
this
dreadful
hint
Mrs.
Micawber
*NL*
threw
her
arms
round
Mr.
Micawber
's
neck
and
entreated
him
to
be
calm
.
*NL*
He
wept
;
but
so
far
recovered
,
almost
immediately
,
as
to
ring
the
bell
*NL*
for
the
waiter
,
and
bespeak
a
hot
kidney
pudding
and
a
plate
of
shrimps
*NL*
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
took
my
leave
of
them
,
they
both
pressed
me
so
much
to
come
and
*NL*
dine
before
they
went
away
,
that
I
could
not
refuse
.
But
,
as
I
knew
I
*NL*
could
not
come
next
day
,
when
I
should
have
a
good
deal
to
prepare
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
Mr.
Micawber
arranged
that
he
would
call
at
Doctor
Strong
's
*NL*
in
the
course
of
the
morning
-LRB-
having
a
presentiment
that
the
remittance
*NL*
would
arrive
by
that
post
-RRB-
,
and
propose
the
day
after
,
if
it
would
suit
*NL*
me
better
.
Accordingly
I
was
called
out
of
school
next
forenoon
,
and
*NL*
found
Mr.
Micawber
in
the
parlor
;
who
had
called
to
say
that
the
dinner
*NL*
would
take
place
as
proposed
.
When
I
asked
him
if
the
remittance
had
*NL*
come
,
he
pressed
my
hand
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
looking
out
of
window
that
same
evening
,
it
surprised
me
,
and
*NL*
made
me
rather
uneasy
,
to
see
Mr.
Micawber
and
Uriah
Heep
walk
past
,
arm
*NL*
in
arm
:
Uriah
humbly
sensible
of
the
honor
that
was
done
him
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
taking
a
bland
delight
in
extending
his
patronage
to
Uriah
.
But
*NL*
I
was
still
more
surprised
,
when
I
went
to
the
little
hotel
next
day
at
*NL*
the
appointed
dinner
hour
,
which
was
four
o'clock
,
to
find
,
from
what
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
said
,
that
he
had
gone
home
with
Uriah
,
and
had
drunk
*NL*
brandy-and-water
at
Mrs.
Heep
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
your
*NL*
friend
Heep
is
a
young
fellow
who
might
be
attorney-general
.
If
I
had
*NL*
known
that
young
man
,
at
the
period
when
my
difficulties
came
to
a
*NL*
crisis
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
I
believe
my
creditors
would
have
been
a
*NL*
great
deal
better
managed
than
they
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
understood
how
this
could
have
been
,
seeing
that
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
had
paid
them
nothing
at
all
as
it
was
;
but
I
did
not
like
to
ask
.
*NL*
Neither
did
I
like
to
say
,
that
I
hoped
he
had
not
been
too
*NL*
communicative
to
Uriah
;
or
to
inquire
if
they
had
talked
much
about
me
.
*NL*
I
was
afraid
of
hurting
Mr.
Micawber
's
feelings
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
's
,
she
being
very
sensitive
;
but
I
was
uncomfortable
about
it
,
*NL*
too
,
and
often
thought
about
it
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
beautiful
little
dinner
.
Quite
an
elegant
dish
of
fish
;
the
*NL*
kidney-end
of
a
loin
of
veal
,
roasted
;
fried
sausage-meat
;
a
partridge
,
*NL*
and
a
pudding
.
There
was
wine
,
and
there
was
strong
ale
;
and
after
*NL*
dinner
Mrs.
Micawber
made
us
a
bowl
of
hot
punch
with
her
own
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
uncommonly
convivial
.
I
never
saw
him
such
good
*NL*
company
.
He
made
his
face
shine
with
the
punch
,
so
that
it
looked
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
varnished
all
over
.
He
got
cheerfully
sentimental
about
the
*NL*
town
,
and
proposed
success
to
it
;
observing
,
that
Mrs.
Micawber
and
*NL*
himself
had
been
made
extremely
snug
and
comfortable
there
,
and
that
he
*NL*
never
should
forget
the
agreeable
hours
they
had
passed
in
Canterbury
.
*NL*
He
proposed
me
afterwards
;
and
he
,
and
Mrs.
Micawber
,
and
I
,
took
a
*NL*
review
of
our
past
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
which
we
sold
the
*NL*
property
all
over
again
.
Then
I
proposed
Mrs.
Micawber
;
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
said
,
modestly
,
``
If
you
'll
allow
me
,
Mrs.
Micawber
,
I
shall
now
have
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
drinking
_
your
_
health
,
ma'am
.
''
On
which
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
delivered
an
eulogium
on
Mrs.
Micawber
's
character
,
and
said
she
had
*NL*
ever
been
his
guide
,
philosopher
,
and
friend
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
recommend
me
,
when
I
came
to
a
marrying
time
of
life
,
to
marry
such
*NL*
another
woman
,
if
such
another
woman
could
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
punch
disappeared
,
Mr.
Micawber
became
still
more
friendly
and
*NL*
convivial
.
Mrs.
Micawber
's
spirits
becoming
elevated
,
too
,
we
sang
``
Auld
*NL*
Lang
Syne
.
''
When
we
came
to
``
Here
's
a
hand
,
my
trusty
frere
,
''
we
all
*NL*
joined
hands
round
the
table
;
and
when
we
declared
we
would
``
take
a
*NL*
right
gude
Willie
Waught
,
''
and
had
n't
the
least
idea
what
it
meant
,
we
*NL*
were
really
affected
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
I
never
saw
any
body
so
thoroughly
jovial
as
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
was
,
down
to
the
very
last
moment
of
the
evening
,
when
I
took
a
hearty
*NL*
farewell
of
himself
and
his
amiable
wife
.
Consequently
,
I
was
not
*NL*
prepared
,
at
seven
o'clock
next
morning
,
to
receive
the
following
*NL*
communication
,
dated
half-past
nine
in
the
evening
;
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
after
I
had
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY

The

is
cast

all

Hiding
the
ravages
of
care
with
a
*NL*
sickly
mask
of
mirth
,
I
have
not
informed
you
,
this
evening
,
that
*NL*
there
is
no
hope
of
the
remittance

Under
these
circumstances
,
*NL*
alike
humiliating
to
endure
,
humiliating
to
contemplate
,
and
*NL*
humiliating
to
relate
,
I
have
discharged
the
pecuniary
liability
*NL*
contracted
at
this
establishment

by
giving
a
note
of
hand

made
*NL*
payable
fourteen

Pentonville

When
it
becomes
due

it
will
not

destruction

He
writes

in
that

If
he
could
think
himself

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
shocked
by
the
contents
of
this
heart-rending
letter
,
that
I
*NL*
ran
off
directly
towards
the
little
hotel
with
the
intention
of
taking
*NL*
it
on
my
way
to
Doctor
Strong
's
,
and
trying
to
soothe
Mr.
Micawber
with
*NL*
a
word
of
comfort
.
But
,
half-way
there
,
I
met
the
London
coach
with
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Micawber
up
behind
;
Mr.
Micawber
,
the
very
picture
of
tranquil
*NL*
enjoyment
,
smiling
at
Mrs.
Micawber
's
conversation
,
eating
walnuts
out
*NL*
of
a
paper
bag
,
with
a
bottle
sticking
out
of
his
breast
pocket
.
As
*NL*
they
did
not
see
me
,
I
thought
it
best
,
all
things
considered
,
not
to
*NL*
see
them
.
So
,
with
a
great
weight
taken
off
my
mind
,
I
turned
into
a
*NL*
by-street
that
was
the
nearest
way
to
school
,
and
felt
,
upon
the
whole
,
*NL*
relieved
that
they
were
gone
;
though
I
still
liked
them
very
much
,

CHAPTER
XVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
RETROSPECT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
school-days
!
The
silent
gliding
on
of
my
existence
--
the
unseen
,
*NL*
unfelt
progress
of
my
life
--
from
childhood
up
to
youth
!
Let
me
think
,
as
*NL*
I
look
back
upon
that
flowing
water
,
now
a
dry
channel
overgrown
with
*NL*
leaves
,
whether
there
are
any
marks
along
its
course
,
by
which
I
can
*NL*
remember
how
it
ran
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
,
and
I
occupy
my
place
in
the
Cathedral
,
where
we
all
went
*NL*
together
,
every
Sunday
morning
,
assembling
first
at
school
for
that
*NL*
purpose
.
The
earthy
smell
,
the
sunless
air
,
the
sensation
of
the
world
*NL*
being
shut
out
,
the
resounding
of
the
organ
through
the
black
and
white
*NL*
arched
galleries
and
aisles
,
are
wings
that
take
me
back
,
and
hold
me
*NL*
hovering
above
those
days
,
in
a
half-sleeping
and
half-waking
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
the
last
boy
in
the
school
.
I
have
risen
,
in
a
few
months
,
over
*NL*
several
heads
.
But
the
first
boy
seems
to
me
a
mighty
creature
,
dwelling
*NL*
afar
off
,
whose
giddy
height
is
unattainable
.
Agnes
says
``
No
,
''
but
I
say
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
and
tell
her
that
she
little
thinks
what
stores
of
knowledge
have
*NL*
been
mastered
by
the
wonderful
Being
,
at
whose
place
she
thinks
I
,
even
*NL*
I
,
weak
aspirant
,
may
arrive
in
time
.
He
is
not
my
private
friend
and
*NL*
public
patron
,
as
Steerforth
was
,
but
I
hold
him
in
a
reverential
*NL*
respect
.
I
chiefly
wonder
what
he
'll
be
,
when
he
leaves
Doctor
Strong
's
,
*NL*
and
what
mankind
will
do
to
maintain
any
place
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
who
is
this
that
breaks
upon
me
?
This
is
Miss
Shepherd
,
whom
I
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Shepherd
is
a
boarder
at
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
establishment
.
I
*NL*
adore
Miss
Shepherd
.
She
is
a
little
girl
,
in
a
spencer
,
with
a
round
*NL*
face
and
curly
flaxen
hair
.
The
Misses
Nettingalls
'
young
ladies
come
to
*NL*
the
Cathedral
too
.
I
can
not
look
upon
my
book
,
for
I
must
look
upon
Miss
*NL*
Shepherd
.
When
the
choristers
chaunt
,
I
hear
Miss
Shepherd
.
In
the
*NL*
service
I
mentally
insert
Miss
Shepherd
's
name
--
I
put
her
in
among
the
*NL*
Royal
Family
.
At
home
,
in
my
own
room
,
I
am
sometimes
moved
to
cry
out
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Miss
Shepherd
!
''
in
a
transport
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
,
I
am
doubtful
of
Miss
Shepherd
's
feelings
,
but
,
at
*NL*
length
,
Fate
being
propitious
,
we
meet
at
the
dancing-school
.
I
have
*NL*
Miss
Shepherd
for
my
partner
.
I
touch
Miss
Shepherd
's
glove
,
and
feel
a
*NL*
thrill
go
up
the
right
arm
of
my
jacket
,
and
come
out
at
my
hair
.
I
say
*NL*
nothing
tender
to
Miss
Shepherd
,
but
we
understand
each
other
.
Miss
*NL*
Shepherd
and
myself
live
but
to
be
united
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
do
I
secretly
give
Miss
Shepherd
twelve
Brazil
nuts
for
a
present
,
I
*NL*
wonder
?
They
are
not
expressive
of
affection
,
they
are
difficult
to
pack
*NL*
into
a
parcel
of
any
regular
shape
,
they
are
hard
to
crack
,
even
in
room
*NL*
doors
,
and
they
are
oily
when
cracked
;
yet
I
feel
that
they
are
*NL*
appropriate
to
Miss
Shepherd
.
Soft
,
seedy
biscuits
,
also
,
I
bestow
upon
*NL*
Miss
Shepherd
;
and
oranges
innumerable
.
Once
,
I
kiss
Miss
Shepherd
in
*NL*
the
cloak
room
.
Ecstacy
!
What
are
my
agony
and
indignation
next
day
,
*NL*
when
I
hear
a
flying
rumour
that
the
Misses
Nettingall
have
stood
Miss
*NL*
Shepherd
in
the
stocks
for
turning
in
her
toes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Shepherd
being
the
one
pervading
theme
and
vision
of
my
life
,
how
*NL*
do
I
ever
come
to
break
with
her
?
I
ca
n't
conceive
.
And
yet
a
coolness
*NL*
grows
between
Miss
Shepherd
and
myself
.
Whispers
reach
me
of
Miss
*NL*
Shepherd
having
said
she
wished
I
would
n't
stare
so
,
and
having
avowed
a
*NL*
preference
for
Master
Jones
--
for
Jones
!
a
boy
of
no
merit
whatever
!
The
*NL*
gulf
between
me
and
Miss
Shepherd
widens
.
At
last
,
one
day
,
I
meet
the
*NL*
Misses
Nettingalls
'
establishment
out
walking
.
Miss
Shepherd
makes
a
*NL*
face
as
she
goes
by
,
and
laughs
to
her
companion
.
All
is
over
.
The
*NL*
devotion
of
a
life
--
it
seems
a
life
,
it
is
all
the
same
--
is
at
an
end
;
*NL*
Miss
Shepherd
comes
out
of
the
morning
service
,
and
the
Royal
Family
*NL*
know
her
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
higher
in
the
school
,
and
no
one
breaks
my
peace
.
I
am
not
at
all
*NL*
polite
,
now
,
to
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
young
ladies
,
and
should
n't
dote
*NL*
on
any
of
them
,
if
they
were
twice
as
many
and
twenty
times
as
*NL*
beautiful
.
I
think
the
dancing-school
a
tiresome
affair
,
and
wonder
why
*NL*
the
girls
ca
n't
dance
by
themselves
and
leave
us
alone
.
I
am
growing
*NL*
great
in
Latin
verses
,
and
neglect
the
laces
of
my
boots
.
Doctor
Strong
*NL*
refers
to
me
in
public
as
a
promising
young
scholar
.
Mr.
Dick
is
wild
*NL*
with
joy
,
and
my
aunt
remits
me
a
guinea
by
the
next
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shade
of
a
young
butcher
rises
,
like
the
apparition
of
an
armed
head
*NL*
in
Macbeth
.
Who
is
this
young
butcher
?
He
is
the
terror
of
the
youth
of
*NL*
Canterbury
.
There
is
a
vague
belief
abroad
,
that
the
beef
suet
with
*NL*
which
he
anoints
his
hair
gives
him
unnatural
strength
,
and
that
he
is
a
*NL*
match
for
a
man
.
He
is
a
broad-faced
,
bull-necked
young
butcher
,
with
*NL*
rough
red
cheeks
,
an
ill-conditioned
mind
,
and
an
injurious
tongue
.
His
*NL*
main
use
of
this
tongue
,
is
,
to
disparage
Doctor
Strong
's
young
*NL*
gentlemen
.
He
says
,
publicly
,
that
if
they
want
anything
he
'll
give
it
*NL*
'em
.
He
names
individuals
among
them
-LRB-
myself
included
-RRB-
,
whom
he
could
*NL*
undertake
to
settle
with
one
hand
,
and
the
other
tied
behind
him
.
He
*NL*
waylays
the
smaller
boys
to
punch
their
unprotected
heads
,
and
calls
*NL*
challenges
after
me
in
the
open
streets
.
For
these
sufficient
reasons
I
*NL*
resolve
to
fight
the
butcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
summer
evening
,
down
in
a
green
hollow
,
at
the
corner
of
a
wall
.
*NL*
I
meet
the
butcher
by
appointment
.
I
am
attended
by
a
select
body
of
our
*NL*
boys
;
the
butcher
,
by
two
other
butchers
,
a
young
publican
,
and
a
sweep
.
*NL*
The
preliminaries
are
adjusted
,
and
the
butcher
and
myself
stand
face
to
*NL*
face
.
In
a
moment
the
butcher
lights
ten
thousand
candles
out
of
my
left
*NL*
eyebrow
.
In
another
moment
,
I
do
n't
know
where
the
wall
is
,
or
where
I
*NL*
am
,
or
where
anybody
is
.
I
hardly
know
which
is
myself
and
which
the
*NL*
butcher
,
we
are
always
in
such
a
tangle
and
tustle
,
knocking
about
upon
*NL*
the
trodden
grass
.
Sometimes
I
see
the
butcher
,
bloody
but
confident
;
*NL*
sometimes
I
see
nothing
,
and
sit
gasping
on
my
second
's
knee
;
sometimes
*NL*
I
go
in
at
the
butcher
madly
,
and
cut
my
knuckles
open
against
his
face
,
*NL*
without
appearing
to
discompose
him
at
all
.
At
last
I
awake
,
very
queer
*NL*
about
the
head
,
as
from
a
giddy
sleep
,
and
see
the
butcher
walking
off
,
*NL*
congratulated
by
the
two
other
butchers
and
the
sweep
and
publican
,
and
*NL*
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
goes
;
from
which
I
augur
,
justly
,
that
the
*NL*
victory
is
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
taken
home
in
a
sad
plight
,
and
I
have
beef-steaks
put
to
my
eyes
,
*NL*
and
am
rubbed
with
vinegar
and
brandy
,
and
find
a
great
white
puffy
*NL*
place
bursting
out
on
my
upper
lip
,
which
swells
immoderately
.
For
three
*NL*
or
four
days
I
remain
at
home
,
a
very
ill-looking
subject
,
with
a
green
*NL*
shade
over
my
eyes
;
and
I
should
be
very
dull
,
but
that
Agnes
is
a
*NL*
sister
to
me
,
and
condoles
with
me
,
and
reads
to
me
,
and
makes
the
time
*NL*
light
and
happy
.
Agnes
has
my
confidence
completely
,
always
;
I
tell
her
*NL*
all
about
the
butcher
,
and
the
wrongs
he
has
heaped
upon
me
;
and
she
*NL*
thinks
I
could
n't
have
done
otherwise
than
fight
the
butcher
,
while
she
*NL*
shrinks
and
trembles
at
my
having
fought
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
has
stolen
on
unobserved
,
for
Adams
is
not
the
head-boy
in
the
days
*NL*
that
are
come
now
,
nor
has
he
been
this
many
and
many
a
day
.
Adams
has
*NL*
left
the
school
so
long
,
that
when
he
comes
back
,
on
a
visit
to
Doctor
*NL*
Strong
,
there
are
not
many
there
,
besides
myself
,
who
know
him
.
Adams
is
*NL*
going
to
be
called
to
the
bar
almost
directly
,
and
is
to
be
an
advocate
,
*NL*
and
to
wear
a
wig
.
I
am
surprised
to
find
him
a
meeker
man
than
I
had
*NL*
thought
,
and
less
imposing
in
appearance
.
He
has
not
staggered
the
world
*NL*
yet
,
either
;
for
it
goes
on
-LRB-
as
well
as
I
can
make
out
-RRB-
pretty
much
the
*NL*
same
as
if
he
had
never
joined
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
blank
,
through
which
the
warriors
of
poetry
and
history
march
on
in
*NL*
stately
hosts
that
seem
to
have
no
end
--
and
what
comes
next
!
_
I
_
am
the
*NL*
head
boy
,
now
;
and
look
down
on
the
line
of
boys
below
me
,
with
a
*NL*
condescending
interest
in
such
of
them
as
bring
to
my
mind
the
boy
I
was
*NL*
myself
,
when
I
first
came
there
.
That
little
fellow
seems
to
be
no
part
*NL*
of
me
;
I
remember
him
as
something
left
behind
upon
the
road
of
life
--
as
*NL*
something
I
have
passed
,
rather
than
have
actually
been
--
and
almost
*NL*
think
of
him
as
of
some
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
little
girl
I
saw
on
that
first
day
at
Mr.
Wickfield
's
,
where
*NL*
is
she
?
Gone
also
.
In
her
stead
,
the
perfect
likeness
of
the
picture
,
*NL*
a
child
likeness
no
more
,
moves
about
the
house
;
and
Agnes
--
my
sweet
*NL*
sister
,
as
I
call
her
in
my
thoughts
,
my
counsellor
and
friend
,
the
*NL*
better
angel
of
the
lives
of
all
who
come
within
her
calm
,
good
,
*NL*
self-denying
influence
--
is
quite
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
other
changes
have
come
upon
me
,
besides
the
changes
in
my
growth
*NL*
and
looks
,
and
in
the
knowledge
I
have
garnered
all
this
while
?
I
wear
a
*NL*
gold
watch
and
chain
,
a
ring
upon
my
little
finger
,
and
a
long-tailed
*NL*
coat
;
and
I
use
a
great
deal
of
bear
's
grease
--
which
,
taken
in
*NL*
conjunction
with
the
ring
,
looks
bad
.
Am
I
in
love
again
?
I
am
.
I
*NL*
worship
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
Miss
Larkins
is
not
a
little
girl
.
She
is
a
tall
,
dark
,
*NL*
black-eyed
,
fine
figure
of
a
woman
.
The
eldest
Miss
Larkins
is
not
a
*NL*
chicken
;
for
the
youngest
Miss
Larkins
is
not
that
,
and
the
eldest
must
*NL*
be
three
or
four
years
older
.
Perhaps
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
may
be
*NL*
about
thirty
.
My
passion
for
her
is
beyond
all
bounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
Miss
Larkins
knows
officers
.
It
is
an
awful
thing
to
bear
.
I
*NL*
see
them
speaking
to
her
in
the
street
.
I
see
them
cross
the
way
to
meet
*NL*
her
,
when
her
bonnet
-LRB-
she
has
a
bright
taste
in
bonnets
-RRB-
is
seen
coming
*NL*
down
the
pavement
,
accompanied
by
her
sister
's
bonnet
.
She
laughs
and
*NL*
talks
,
and
seems
to
like
it
.
I
spend
a
good
deal
of
my
own
spare
time
in
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
to
meet
her
.
If
I
can
bow
to
her
once
in
the
day
-LRB-
I
*NL*
know
her
to
bow
to
,
knowing
Mr.
Larkins
-RRB-
,
I
am
happier
.
I
deserve
a
bow
*NL*
now
and
then
.
The
raging
agonies
I
suffer
on
the
night
of
the
Race
Ball
,
*NL*
where
I
know
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
will
be
dancing
with
the
military
,
*NL*
ought
to
have
some
compensation
,
if
there
be
even-handed
justice
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
passion
takes
away
my
appetite
,
and
makes
me
wear
my
newest
silk
*NL*
neck-kerchief
continually
.
I
have
no
relief
but
in
putting
on
my
best
*NL*
clothes
,
and
having
my
boots
cleaned
over
and
over
again
.
I
seem
,
then
,
*NL*
to
be
worthier
of
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
.
Everything
that
belongs
to
*NL*
her
,
or
is
connected
with
her
,
is
precious
to
me
.
Mr.
Larkins
-LRB-
a
gruff
*NL*
old
gentleman
with
a
double
chin
,
and
one
of
his
eyes
immoveable
in
his
*NL*
head
-RRB-
is
fraught
with
interest
to
me
.
When
I
ca
n't
meet
his
daughter
,
I
*NL*
go
where
I
am
likely
to
meet
him
.
To
say
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Larkins
?
*NL*
Are
the
young
ladies
and
all
the
family
quite
well
?
''
seems
so
pointed
,
*NL*
that
I
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
continually
about
my
age
.
Say
I
am
seventeen
,
and
say
that
*NL*
seventeen
is
young
for
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
,
what
of
that
?
Besides
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
one-and-twenty
in
no
time
almost
.
I
regularly
take
walks
*NL*
outside
Mr.
Larkins
's
house
in
the
evening
,
though
it
cuts
me
to
the
*NL*
heart
to
see
the
officers
go
in
,
or
to
hear
them
up
in
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
where
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
plays
the
harp
.
I
even
walk
,
on
two
or
*NL*
three
occasions
,
in
a
sickly
,
spoony
manner
,
round
and
round
the
house
*NL*
after
the
family
are
gone
to
bed
,
wondering
which
is
the
eldest
Miss
*NL*
Larkins
's
chamber
-LRB-
and
pitching
,
I
dare
say
now
,
on
Mr.
Larkins
's
*NL*
instead
-RRB-
;
wishing
that
a
fire
would
burst
out
;
that
the
assembled
crowd
*NL*
would
stand
appalled
;
that
I
,
dashing
through
them
with
a
ladder
,
might
*NL*
rear
it
against
her
window
,
save
her
in
my
arms
,
go
back
for
something
*NL*
she
had
left
behind
,
and
perish
in
the
flames
.
For
I
am
generally
*NL*
disinterested
in
my
love
,
and
think
I
could
be
content
to
make
a
figure
*NL*
before
Miss
Larkins
,
and
expire
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Generally
,
but
not
always
.
Sometimes
brighter
visions
rise
before
me
.
*NL*
When
I
dress
-LRB-
the
occupation
of
two
hours
-RRB-
,
for
a
great
ball
given
at
*NL*
the
Larkins
's
-LRB-
the
anticipation
of
three
weeks
-RRB-
,
I
indulge
my
fancy
with
*NL*
pleasing
images
.
I
picture
myself
taking
courage
to
make
a
declaration
*NL*
to
Miss
Larkins
.
I
picture
Miss
Larkins
sinking
her
head
upon
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
saying
,
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
can
I
believe
my
ears
!
''
I
*NL*
picture
Mr.
Larkins
waiting
on
me
next
morning
,
and
saying
,
``
My
dear
*NL*
Copperfield
,
my
daughter
has
told
me
all
.
Youth
is
no
objection
.
Here
*NL*
are
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
Be
happy
!
''
I
picture
my
aunt
relenting
,
and
*NL*
blessing
us
;
and
Mr.
Dick
and
Doctor
Strong
being
present
at
the
*NL*
marriage
ceremony
.
I
am
a
sensible
fellow
,
I
believe
--
I
believe
,
on
*NL*
looking
back
,
I
mean
--
and
modest
I
am
sure
;
but
all
this
goes
on
*NL*
notwithstanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
repair
to
the
enchanted
house
,
where
there
are
lights
,
chattering
,
*NL*
music
,
flowers
,
officers
-LRB-
I
am
sorry
to
see
-RRB-
,
and
the
eldest
Miss
*NL*
Larkins
,
a
blaze
of
beauty
.
She
is
dressed
in
blue
,
with
blue
flowers
*NL*
in
her
hair
--
forget-me-nots
--
as
if
_
she
_
had
any
need
to
wear
*NL*
forget-me-nots
!
It
is
the
first
really
grown-up
party
that
I
have
ever
*NL*
been
invited
to
,
and
I
am
a
little
uncomfortable
;
for
I
appear
not
*NL*
to
belong
to
anybody
,
and
nobody
appears
to
have
anything
to
say
to
*NL*
me
,
except
Mr.
Larkins
,
who
asks
me
how
my
schoolfellows
are
,
which
*NL*
he
need
n't
do
,
as
I
have
not
come
there
to
be
insulted
.
But
after
I
*NL*
have
stood
in
the
doorway
for
some
time
,
and
feasted
my
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
goddess
of
my
heart
,
she
approaches
me
--
she
,
the
eldest
Miss
*NL*
Larkins
!
--
and
asks
me
,
pleasantly
,
if
I
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stammer
,
with
a
bow
,
``
With
you
,
Miss
Larkins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
no
one
else
?
''
enquires
Miss
Larkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
no
pleasure
in
dancing
with
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Larkins
laughs
and
blushes
-LRB-
or
I
think
she
blushes
-RRB-
,
and
says
,
*NL*
``
Next
time
but
one
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
arrives
.
``
It
is
a
waltz
,
I
think
,
''
Miss
Larkins
doubtfully
*NL*
observes
,
when
I
present
myself
.
``
Do
you
waltz
?
If
not
,
Captain
*NL*
Bailey
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
do
waltz
-LRB-
pretty
well
,
too
,
as
it
happens
-RRB-
,
and
I
take
Miss
*NL*
Larkins
out
.
I
take
her
sternly
from
the
side
of
Captain
Bailey
.
He
is
*NL*
wretched
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
but
he
is
nothing
to
me
.
I
have
been
*NL*
wretched
,
too
.
I
waltz
with
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
!
I
do
n't
know
where
,
*NL*
among
whom
,
or
how
long
.
I
only
know
that
I
swim
about
in
space
,
with
a
*NL*
blue
angel
,
in
a
state
of
blissful
delirium
,
until
I
find
myself
alone
*NL*
with
her
in
a
little
room
,
resting
on
a
sofa
.
She
admires
a
flower
-LRB-
pink
*NL*
camelia
japonica
,
price
half-a-crown
-RRB-
,
in
my
button
hole
.
I
give
it
her
,
*NL*
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
an
inestimable
price
for
it
,
Miss
Larkins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
What
is
that
?
''
returns
Miss
Larkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
flower
of
yours
,
that
I
may
treasure
it
as
a
miser
does
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
bold
boy
,
''
says
Miss
Larkins
.
``
There
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gives
it
me
,
not
displeased
;
and
I
put
it
to
my
lips
,
and
then
into
*NL*
my
breast
.
Miss
Larkins
,
laughing
,
draws
her
hand
through
my
arm
,
and
*NL*
says
,
``
Now
take
me
back
to
Captain
Bailey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
lost
in
the
recollection
of
this
delicious
interview
,
and
the
*NL*
waltz
,
when
she
comes
to
me
again
,
with
a
plain
elderly
gentleman
,
who
*NL*
has
been
playing
whist
all
night
,
upon
her
arm
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
here
is
my
bold
friend
!
Mr.
Chestle
wants
to
know
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
at
once
that
he
is
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
am
much
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admire
your
taste
,
sir
,
''
says
Mr.
Chestle
.
``
It
does
you
credit
.
*NL*
I
suppose
you
do
n't
take
much
interest
in
hops
;
but
I
am
a
pretty
*NL*
large
grower
myself
;
and
if
you
ever
like
to
come
over
to
our
*NL*
neighbourhood
--
neighbourhood
of
Ashford
--
and
take
a
run
about
our
*NL*
place
,
we
shall
be
glad
for
you
to
stop
as
long
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thank
Mr.
Chestle
warmly
,
and
shake
hands
.
I
think
I
am
in
a
happy
*NL*
dream
.
I
waltz
with
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
once
again
--
she
says
I
waltz
*NL*
so
well
!
I
go
home
in
a
state
of
unspeakable
bliss
,
and
waltz
in
*NL*
imagination
,
all
night
long
,
with
my
arm
round
the
blue
waist
of
my
dear
*NL*
divinity
.
For
some
days
afterwards
,
I
am
lost
in
rapturous
reflections
;
*NL*
but
I
neither
see
her
in
the
street
,
nor
when
I
call
.
I
am
imperfectly
*NL*
consoled
for
this
disappointment
by
the
sacred
pledge
,
the
perished
*NL*
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trotwood

''
says
Agnes
,
one
day
after
dinner
.
``
Who
do
you
think

going
*NL*
to
be
married
to-morrow
?
Some
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

raising
her
cheerful
face
from
the
music
she
is
copying
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
hear
him

--
The
eldest

Larkins

*NL*
*NL*
``

to
Captain

I
have
just
power
enough
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
to
no
Captain
.
To
Mr.
Chestle
,
a
hop-grower

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
terribly
dejected
for
about
a
week
or
two
.
I
take
off
my
ring
,
I
*NL*
wear
my
worst
clothes
,
I
use
no
bear
's
grease
,
and
I
frequently
lament
*NL*
over
the
late
Miss
Larkins
's
faded
flower
.
Being
,
by
that
time
,
rather
*NL*
tired
of
this
kind
of
life
,
and
having
received
new
provocation
from
the
*NL*
butcher
,
I
throw
the
flower
away
,
go
out
with
the
butcher
,
and
*NL*
gloriously
defeat
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
and
the
resumption
of
my
ring
,
as
well
as
of
the
bear
's
grease
in
*NL*
moderation
,
are
the
last
marks
I
can
discern
,
now
,
in
my
progress
to
*NL*
seventeen

*NL*
CHAPTER
XIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
LOOK
ABOUT
ME
,
AND
MAKE
A
DISCOVERY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
doubtful
whether
I
was
at
heart
glad
or
sorry
,
when
my
school-days
*NL*
drew
to
an
end
,
and
the
time
came
for
my
leaving
Doctor
Strong
's
.
I
had
*NL*
been
very
happy
there
,
I
had
a
great
attachment
for
the
Doctor
,
and
I
*NL*
was
eminent
and
distinguished
in
that
little
world
.
For
these
reasons
I
*NL*
was
sorry
to
go
;
but
for
other
reasons
,
unsubstantial
enough
,
I
was
*NL*
glad
.
Misty
ideas
of
being
a
young
man
at
my
own
disposal
,
of
the
*NL*
importance
attaching
to
a
young
man
at
his
own
disposal
,
of
the
*NL*
wonderful
things
to
be
seen
and
done
by
that
magnificent
animal
,
and
the
*NL*
wonderful
effects
he
could
not
fail
to
make
upon
society
,
lured
me
away
.
*NL*
So
powerful
were
these
visionary
considerations
in
my
boyish
mind
,
that
*NL*
I
seem
,
according
to
my
present
way
of
thinking
,
to
have
left
school
*NL*
without
natural
regret
.
The
separation
has
not
made
the
impression
on
*NL*
me
,
that
other
separations
have
.
I
try
in
vain
to
recal
how
I
felt
about
*NL*
it
,
and
what
its
circumstances
were
;
but
it
is
not
momentous
in
my
*NL*
recollection
.
I
suppose
the
opening
prospect
confused
me
.
I
know
that
my
*NL*
juvenile
experiences
went
for
little
or
nothing
then
;
and
that
life
was
*NL*
more
like
a
great
fairy
story
,
which
I
was
just
about
to
begin
to
read
,
*NL*
than
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
and
I
had
held
many
grave
deliberations
on
the
calling
to
which
*NL*
I
should
be
devoted
.
For
a
year
or
more
I
had
endeavoured
to
find
a
*NL*
satisfactory
answer
to
her
often-repeated
question
,
``
What
I
would
like
*NL*
to
be
?
''
But
I
had
no
particular
liking
,
that
I
could
discover
,
for
*NL*
anything
.
If
I
could
have
been
inspired
with
a
knowledge
of
the
science
*NL*
of
navigation
,
taken
the
command
of
a
fast-sailing
expedition
,
and
gone
*NL*
round
the
world
on
a
triumphant
voyage
of
discovery
,
I
think
I
might
*NL*
have
considered
myself
completely
suited
.
But
,
in
the
absence
of
any
*NL*
such
miraculous
provision
,
my
desire
was
to
apply
myself
to
some
pursuit
*NL*
that
would
not
lie
too
heavily
upon
her
purse
;
and
to
do
my
duty
in
it
,
*NL*
whatever
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
had
regularly
assisted
at
our
councils
,
with
a
meditative
and
*NL*
sage
demeanour
.
He
never
made
a
suggestion
but
once
;
and
on
that
*NL*
occasion
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
what
put
it
in
his
head
-RRB-
,
he
suddenly
proposed
*NL*
that
I
should
be
``
a
Brazier
.
''
My
aunt
received
this
proposal
so
very
*NL*
ungraciously
,
that
he
never
ventured
on
a
second
;
but
ever
afterwards
*NL*
confined
himself
to
looking
watchfully
at
her
for
her
suggestions
,
and
*NL*
rattling
his
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
I
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
one
morning
in
the
*NL*
Christmas
season
when
I
left
school
;
``
as
this
knotty
point
is
still
*NL*
unsettled
,
and
as
we
must
not
make
a
mistake
in
our
decision
if
we
can
*NL*
help
it
,
I
think
we
had
better
take
a
little
breathing-time
.
In
the
*NL*
meanwhile
,
you
must
try
to
look
at
it
from
a
new
point
of
view
,
and
not
*NL*
as
a
schoolboy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
occurred
to
me
,
''
pursued
my
aunt
,
``
that
a
little
change
,
and
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
life
out
of
doors
,
may
be
useful
,
in
helping
you
to
know
your
*NL*
own
mind
,
and
form
a
cooler
judgment
.
Suppose
you
were
to
take
a
little
*NL*
journey
now
.
Suppose
you
were
to
go
down
into
the
old
part
of
the
*NL*
country
again
,
for
instance
,
and
see
that
--
that
out-of-the-way
woman
*NL*
with
the
savagest
of
names
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
,
for
she
*NL*
could
never
thoroughly
forgive
Peggotty
for
being
so
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
all
things
in
the
world
,
aunt
,
I
should
like
it
best
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
that
's
lucky
,
for
I
should
like
it
too
.
But
it
's
*NL*
natural
and
rational
that
you
should
like
it
.
And
I
am
very
well
*NL*
persuaded
that
whatever
you
do
,
Trot
,
will
always
be
natural
and
*NL*
rational

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so

aunt

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister

Betsey
Trotwood

said
my
aunt
,
``
would
have
been
as

natural

rational

ever
breathed

'll
be

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
It

mother
of
yours

n't

*NL*
said
my
aunt
,
looking
at
me
approvingly
,
``
or
she
'd
have
been
so
vain
of
*NL*
her
boy
by
this
time

completely
turned

-LRB-
My
aunt
*NL*
always
excused
any
weakness
of
her
own
in
my
behalf
,
by
transferring
it
*NL*
in
this
way
to
my
poor
mother
.
-RRB-
``
Bless
me
,
Trotwood
,
how
you
do
remind
*NL*
me
of
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasantly

I
hope

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
as
like
her

said
my
aunt
,
emphatically
,
``
he
's
as
like
her

as
she
was
that
afternoon
,
before
she
began
to
fret

my

decisively

*NL*
*NL*

He
is
very
like

Mr.

*NL*
``
But

I
want
you

resumed
my

I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
physically

but
morally

you
are
very
well
physically

a
firm
*NL*
fellow
.
A
fine
firm
fellow

with
a
will
of
your
own
.
With
resolution
,

*NL*
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
cap
at
me
,
and
clenching
her
hand
.
``
With
*NL*
determination
.
With
character

Trot

with
strength
of
character
that
is
*NL*
not
to
be
influenced
,
except
on
good
reason
,
by
anybody
,
or
by
anything
.
*NL*
That
's
what
I
want
you
to
be
.
That
's
what
your
father
and
mother
might
*NL*
both
have
been
,
Heaven
knows
,
and
been
the
better
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
intimated
that
I
hoped
I
should
be
what
she
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
may
begin
,
in
a
small
way
,
to
have
a
reliance
upon
yourself

*NL*

to
act
for
yourself
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
I
shall
send
you
upon
your
*NL*
trip
,
alone

I
did
think
,
once
,
of
Mr.
Dick
's
going
with
you
;
but
,
on
*NL*
second
thoughts
,
I
shall
keep
him
to
take
care
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
,
for
a
moment
,
looked
a
little
disappointed
;
until
the
honor
*NL*
and
dignity
of
having
to
take
care
of
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
the
*NL*
world
,
restored
the
sunshine
to
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
there
's
the
Memorial
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
certainly
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
in
a
hurry
,
``
I
intend
,
Trotwood
,
to
get
*NL*
that
done
immediately
--
it
really
must
be
done
immediately
!
And
then
it
*NL*
will
go
in
,
you
know
--
and
then
--
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
after
checking
*NL*
himself
,
and
pausing
a
long
time
,
``
there
'll
be
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
my
aunt
's
kind
scheme
,
I
was
shortly
afterwards
fitted
*NL*
out
with
a
handsome
purse
of
money
,
and
a
portmanteau
,
and
tenderly
*NL*
dismissed
upon
my
expedition
.
At
parting
,
my
aunt
gave
me
some
good
*NL*
advice
,
and
a
good
many
kisses
;
and
said
that
as
her
object
was
that
I
*NL*
should
look
about
me
,
and
should
think
a
little
,
she
would
recommend
me
*NL*
to
stay
a
few
days
in
London
,
if
I
liked
it
,
either
on
my
way
down
into
*NL*
Suffolk
,
or
in
coming
back
.
In
a
word
,
I
was
at
liberty
to
do
what
I
*NL*
would
,
for
three
weeks
or
a
month
;
and
no
other
conditions
were
imposed
*NL*
upon
my
freedom
than
the
before-mentioned
thinking
and
looking
about
me
,
*NL*
and
a
pledge
to
write
three
times
a
week
and
faithfully
report
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
Canterbury
first
,
that
I
might
take
leave
of
Agnes
and
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
-LRB-
my
old
room
in
whose
house
I
had
not
yet
relinquished
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
also
of
the
good
Doctor
.
Agnes
was
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
told
me
that
*NL*
the
house
had
not
been
like
itself
since
I
had
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
am
not
like
myself
when
I
am
away
,
''
said
I.
``
I
seem
to
want
*NL*
my
right
hand
,
when
I
miss
you
.
Though
that
's
not
saying
much
;
for
*NL*
there
's
no
head
in
my
right
hand
,
and
no
heart
.
Every
one
who
knows
you
,
*NL*
consults
with
you
,
and
is
guided
by
you
,
Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
one
who
knows
me
,
spoils
me
,
I
believe
,
''
she
answered
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
It
's
because
you
are
like
no
one
else
.
You
are
so
good
,
and
so
*NL*
sweet-tempered
.
You
have
such
a
gentle
nature
,
and
you
are
always
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
,
''
said
Agnes
,
breaking
into
a
pleasant
laugh
,
as
she
sat
at
*NL*
work
,
``
as
if
I
were
the
late
Miss
Larkins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
It
's
not
fair
to
abuse
my
confidence
,
''
I
answered
,
reddening
*NL*
at
the
recollection
of
my
blue
enslaver
.
``
But
I
shall
confide
in
you
,
*NL*
just
the
same
,
Agnes
.
I
can
never
grow
out
of
that
.
Whenever
I
fall
*NL*
into
trouble
,
or
fall
in
love
,
I
shall
always
tell
you
,
if
you
'll
let
*NL*
me
--
even
when
I
come
to
fall
in
love
in
earnest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
have
always
been
in
earnest
!
''
said
Agnes
,
laughing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
was
as
a
child
,
or
a
school-boy
,
''
said
I
,
laughing
in
my
turn
,
*NL*
not
without
being
a
little
shame-faced
.
``
Times
are
altering
now
,
and
I
*NL*
suppose
I
shall
be
in
a
terrible
state
of
earnestness
one
day
or
other
.
*NL*
My
wonder
is
,
that
you
are
not
in
earnest
yourself
,
by
this
time
,
*NL*
Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
laughed
again
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
you
are
not
!
''
said
I
,
``
because
if
you
had
been
,
you
would
*NL*
have
told
me
.
Or
at
least
''
--
for
I
saw
a
faint
blush
in
her
face
,
``
you
*NL*
would
have
let
me
find
it
out
for
myself
.
But
there
is
no
one
that
I
*NL*
know
of
,
who
deserves
to
love
_
you
_
,
Agnes
.
Some
one
of
a
nobler
*NL*
character
,
and
more
worthy
altogether
than
any
one
I
have
ever
seen
*NL*
here
,
must
rise
up
,
before
I
give
_
my
_
consent
.
In
the
time
to
come
,
I
*NL*
shall
have
a
wary
eye
on
all
admirers
;
and
shall
exact
a
great
deal
from
*NL*
the
successful
one
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
gone
on
,
so
far
,
in
a
mixture
of
confidential
jest
and
earnest
,
*NL*
that
had
long
grown
naturally
out
of
our
familiar
relations
,
begun
as
*NL*
mere
children
.
But
Agnes
,
now
suddenly
lifting
up
her
eyes
to
mine
,
and
*NL*
speaking
in
a
different
manner
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trotwood
,
there
is
something
that
I
want
to
ask
you
,
and
that
I
may
not
*NL*
have
another
opportunity
of
asking
for
a
long
time
,
perhaps
--
something
I
*NL*
would
ask
,
I
think
,
of
no
one
else
.
Have
you
observed
any
gradual
*NL*
alteration
in
Papa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
observed
it
,
and
had
often
wondered
whether
she
had
too
.
I
must
*NL*
have
shown
as
much
,
now
,
in
my
face
;
for
her
eyes
were
in
a
moment
cast
*NL*
down
,
and
I
saw
tears
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
it
is
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
--
shall
I
be
quite
plain
,
Agnes
,
liking
him
so
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
does
himself
no
good
by
the
habit
that
has
increased
upon
*NL*
him
since
I
first
came
here
.
He
is
often
very
nervous
--
or
I
fancy
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
fancy
,
''
said
Agnes
,
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
hand
trembles
,
his
speech
is
not
plain
,
and
his
eyes
look
wild
.
I
*NL*
have
remarked
that
at
those
times
,
and
when
he
is
least
like
himself
,
he
*NL*
is
most
certain
to
be
wanted
on
some
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Uriah
,
''
said
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
the
sense
of
being
unfit
for
it
,
or
of
not
having
understood
*NL*
it
,
or
of
having
shown
his
condition
in
spite
of
himself
,
seems
to
make
*NL*
him
so
uneasy
,
that
next
day
he
is
worse
,
and
next
day
worse
,
and
so
he
*NL*
becomes
jaded
and
haggard
.
Do
not
be
alarmed
by
what
I
say
,
Agnes
,
but
*NL*
in
this
state
I
saw
him
,
only
the
other
evening
,
lay
down
his
head
upon
*NL*
his
desk
,
and
shed
tears
like
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
passed
softly
before
my
lips
while
I
was
yet
speaking
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
she
had
met
her
father
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
and
was
hanging
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
.
The
expression
of
her
face
,
as
they
both
looked
towards
*NL*
me
,
I
felt
to
be
very
touching
.
There
was
such
deep
fondness
for
him
,
*NL*
and
gratitude
to
him
for
all
his
love
and
care
,
in
her
beautiful
look
;
*NL*
and
there
was
such
a
fervent
appeal
to
me
to
deal
tenderly
by
him
,
even
*NL*
in
my
inmost
thoughts
,
and
to
let
no
harsh
construction
find
any
place
*NL*
against
him
;
she
was
,
at
once
,
so
proud
of
him
and
devoted
to
him
,
yet
*NL*
so
compassionate
and
sorry
,
and
so
reliant
upon
me
to
be
so
,
too
;
that
*NL*
nothing
she
could
have
said
would
have
expressed
more
to
me
,
or
moved
me
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
to
drink
tea
at
the
Doctor
's
.
We
went
there
at
the
usual
hour
;
*NL*
and
round
the
study-fireside
found
the
Doctor
,
and
his
young
wife
,
and
*NL*
her
mother
.
The
Doctor
,
who
made
as
much
of
my
going
away
as
if
I
were
*NL*
going
to
China
,
received
me
as
an
honored
guest
;
and
called
for
a
log
of
*NL*
wood
to
be
thrown
on
the
fire
,
that
he
might
see
the
face
of
his
old
*NL*
pupil
reddening
in
the
blaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
see
many
more
new
faces
in
Trotwood
's
stead
,
Wickfield
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Doctor
,
warming
his
hands
;
``
I
am
getting
lazy
,
and
want
ease
.
I
*NL*
shall
relinquish
all
my
young
people
in
another
six
months
,
and
lead
a
*NL*
quieter
life
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
so

any
time
these
ten
years

Mr.
Wickfield
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
I
mean
to
do
it

returned
the
Doctor
.
``
My
first
master
will
*NL*
succeed
me

I
am
in
earnest
at
last

so
you
'll
soon
have
to
arrange
our
*NL*
contracts

to
bind
us
firmly
to
them

like
a
couple
of
knaves

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
take
care

said
Mr.
Wickfield
,

certainly
would
be

you
should
make
for

yourself

Well

I
am
ready

There
are
worse
tasks
than
that

in
my
*NL*
calling

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
nothing
to
think
of
then

said
the
Doctor
,
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
``
but
my
Dictionary

and
this
other
contract-bargain

Annie

*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Wickfield
glanced
towards
her
,
sitting
at
the
tea-table
by
Agnes
,
*NL*
she
seemed
to
me
to
avoid
his
look
with
such
unwonted
hesitation
and
*NL*
timidity
,
that
his
attention
became
fixed
upon
her
,
as
if
something
were
*NL*
suggested
to
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
post
come
in
from
India
,
I
observe
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
short
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By-the-by

and
letters
from
Mr.
Jack
Maldon

said
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
shaking
her
head

``

He
looked
strong

he
was

My

Doctor

it
was
*NL*
his
spirit

he
ventured
on
so
boldly

Annie

Mrs.

with
emphasis

looking
round
upon

generally

*NL*
*NL*
Annie
,
thus
addressed

made
no

*NL*
``

of

can
mention

As
to
his
liver
,
''
said
the
Old
Soldier
*NL*
resignedly
,
``
that
,
of
course
,
he
gave
up
altogether
,
when
he
first
went
*NL*
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
say
all
this
?
''
asked
Mr.
Wickfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
?
My
dear
sir
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Markleham
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
*NL*
fan
,
``
you
little
know
my
poor
Jack
Maldon
when
you
ask
that
question
.
*NL*
Say
?
Not
he

You
might
drag
him
at
the
heels
of
four
wild
horses
first
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mama
!
''
said
Mrs.
Strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
my
dear

''
returned
her
mother
,
``
once
for
all
,
I
must
really
beg
*NL*
that
you
will
not
interfere
with
me

unless
it
is

confirm
what
I
say

*NL*
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
your
cousin
Maldon
would
be
dragged
at
*NL*

I

eight

sixteen

two-and-thirty

*NL*
rather
than

anything
calculated
to
overturn
the
Doctor

plans

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wickfield
's
plans
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
stroking
his
face
,
and
looking
*NL*
penitently
at
his
adviser
.
``
That
is
to
say
,
our
joint
plans

I
*NL*
said
myself

at

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
said
,
''
added
Mr.
Wickfield
gravely
,
``
abroad

I
was
the
means
of
*NL*
sending
him
abroad

It
's
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Responsibility

said
the
Old
Soldier

Every

said
the
Old
Soldier
,
*NL*
fanning
herself
,
in
a
sort
of
calm
prophetic
agony
,
``

I
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well

said
the
Doctor
,
cheerfully
,
``
I
am
not
bigoted

Maldon
comes
home
on
account
of
ill
health
,
he
must
*NL*
not
be
allowed
to
go
back
,
and
we
must
endeavour
to
make
some
more
*NL*
suitable
and
fortunate
provision
for
him
in
this
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Markleham
was
so
overcome
by
this
generous
speech
--
which
,
I
need
*NL*
not
say
,
she
had
not
at
all
expected
or
led
up
to
--
that
she
could
only
*NL*
tell
the
Doctor
it
was
like
himself
,
and
go
several
times
through
that
*NL*
operation
of
kissing
the
sticks
of
her
fan
,
and
then
tapping
his
hand
*NL*
with
it
.
After
which
she
gently
chid
her
daughter
Annie
,
for
not
being
*NL*
more
demonstrative
when
such
kindnesses
were
showered
,
for
her
sake
,
on
*NL*
her
old
playfellow
;
and
entertained
us
with
some
particulars
concerning
*NL*
other
deserving
members
of
her
family
,
whom
it
was
desirable
to
set
on
*NL*
their
deserving
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
her
daughter
Annie
never
once
spoke
,
or
lifted
up
her
*NL*
eyes
.
All
this
time
,
Mr.
Wickfield
had
his
glance
upon
her
as
she
sat
by
*NL*
his
own
daughter
's
side
.
It
appeared
to
me
that
he
never
thought
of
*NL*
being
observed
by
any
one
;
but
was
so
intent
upon
her
,
and
upon
his
own
*NL*
thoughts
in
connexion
with
her
,
as
to
be
quite
absorbed
.
He
now
asked
*NL*
what
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
had
actually
written
in
reference
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
to
whom
he
had
written
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
here
,
''
said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
taking
a
letter
from
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
above
the
Doctor
's
head
,
``
the
dear
fellow
says
to
the
*NL*
Doctor
himself
--
where
is
it
?
Oh
!
--
'
I
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
*NL*
my
health
is
suffering
severely
,
and
that
I
fear
I
may
be
reduced
*NL*
to
the
necessity
of
returning
home
for
a
time
,
as
the
only
hope
of
*NL*
restoration
.
'
That
's
pretty
plain
,
poor
fellow
!
His
only
hope
of
*NL*
restoration
!
But
Annie
's
letter
is
plainer
still
.
Annie
,
show
me
that
*NL*
letter
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
,
mama
,
''
she
pleaded
in
a
low
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
absolutely
are
,
on
some
subjects
,
one
of
the
most
*NL*
ridiculous
persons
in
the
world
,
''
returned
her
mother
,
``
and
perhaps
the
*NL*
most
unnatural
to
the
claims
of
your
own
family
.
We
never
should
have
*NL*
heard
of
the
letter
at
all
,
I
believe
,
unless
I
had
asked
for
it
myself
.
*NL*
Do
you
call
that
confidence
,
my
love
,
towards
Doctor
Strong
?
I
am
*NL*
surprised
.
You
ought
to
know
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
reluctantly
produced
;
and
as
I
handed
it
to
the
old
lady
,
*NL*
I
saw
how
the
unwilling
hand
from
which
I
took
it
,
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
see
,
''
said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
putting
her
glass
to
her
eye
,
*NL*
``
where
the
passage
is
.
`
The
remembrance
of
old
times
,
my
dearest
*NL*
Annie
'
--
and
so
forth
--
it
's
not
there
.
`
The
amiable
old
Proctor
'
--
who
's
*NL*
he
?
Dear
me
,
Annie
,
how
illegibly
your
cousin
Maldon
writes
,
and
how
*NL*
stupid
I
am
!
`
Doctor
,
'
of
course
.
Ah
!
amiable
indeed
!
''
Here
she
left
*NL*
off
,
to
kiss
her
fan
again
,
and
shake
it
at
the
Doctor
,
who
was
looking
*NL*
at
us
in
a
state
of
placid
satisfaction
.
``
Now
I
have
found
it
.
'
_
You
_
*NL*
may
not
be
surprised
to
hear
,
Annie
'
--
no
,
to
be
sure
,
knowing
that
he
*NL*
never
was
really
strong
;
what
did
I
say
just
now
?
--
`
that
I
have
*NL*
undergone
so
much
in
this
distant
place
,
as
to
have
decided
to
leave
it
*NL*
at
all
hazards
;
on
sick
leave
,
if
I
can
;
on
total
resignation
,
if
that
*NL*
is
not
to
be
obtained
.
What
I
have
endured
,
and
do
endure
here
,
is
*NL*
insupportable
.
'
And
but
for
the
promptitude
of
that
best
of
creatures
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
telegraphing
the
Doctor
as
before
,
and
refolding
*NL*
the
letter
,
``
it
would
be
insupportable
to
me
to
think
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
said
not
one
word
,
though
the
old
lady
looked
to
him
as
if
*NL*
for
his
commentary
on
this
intelligence
;
but
sat
severely
silent
,
with
*NL*
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
.
Long
after
the
subject
was
dismissed
,
and
*NL*
other
topics
occupied
us
,
he
remained
so
;
seldom
raising
his
eyes
,
*NL*
unless
to
rest
them
for
a
moment
,
with
a
thoughtful
frown
,
upon
the
*NL*
Doctor
,
or
his
wife
,
or
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
was
very
fond
of
music
.
Agnes
sang
with
great
sweetness
and
*NL*
expression
,
and
so
did
Mrs.
Strong
.
They
sang
together
,
and
played
duets
*NL*
together
,
and
we
had
quite
a
little
concert
.
But
I
remarked
two
things
:
*NL*
first
,
that
though
Annie
soon
recovered
her
composure
,
and
was
quite
*NL*
herself
,
there
was
a
blank
between
her
and
Mr.
Wickfield
which
separated
*NL*
them
wholly
from
each
other
;
secondly
,
that
Mr.
Wickfield
seemed
to
*NL*
dislike
the
intimacy
between
her
and
Agnes
,
and
to
watch
it
with
*NL*
uneasiness
.
And
now
,
I
must
confess
,
the
recollection
of
what
I
had
seen
*NL*
on
that
night
when
Mr.
Maldon
went
away
,
first
began
to
return
upon
me
*NL*
with
a
meaning
it
had
never
had
,
and
to
trouble
me
.
The
innocent
beauty
*NL*
of
her
face
was
not
as
innocent
to
me
as
it
had
been
;
I
mistrusted
the
*NL*
natural
grace
and
charm
of
her
manner
;
and
when
I
looked
at
Agnes
by
her
*NL*
side
,
and
thought
how
good
and
true
Agnes
was
,
suspicions
arose
within
*NL*
me
that
it
was
an
ill-assorted
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
happy
in
it
herself
,
however
,
and
the
other
was
so
happy
too
,
*NL*
that
they
made
the
evening
fly
away
as
if
it
were
but
an
hour
.
It
closed
*NL*
in
an
incident
which
I
well
remember
.
They
were
taking
leave
of
each
*NL*
other
,
and
Agnes
was
going
to
embrace
her
and
kiss
her
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
stepped
between
them
,
as
if
by
accident
,
and
drew
Agnes
*NL*
quickly
away
.
Then
I
saw
,
as
though
all
the
intervening
time
had
been
*NL*
cancelled
,
and
I
were
still
standing
in
the
doorway
on
the
night
of
the
*NL*
departure
,
the
expression
of
that
night
in
the
face
of
Mrs.
Strong
,
as
*NL*
it
confronted
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
what
an
impression
this
made
upon
me
,
or
how
impossible
I
*NL*
found
it
,
when
I
thought
of
her
afterwards
,
to
separate
her
from
this
*NL*
look
,
and
remember
her
face
in
its
innocent
loveliness
again
.
It
haunted
*NL*
me
when
I
got
home
.
I
seemed
to
have
left
the
Doctor
's
roof
with
a
dark
*NL*
cloud
lowering
on
it
.
The
reverence
that
I
had
for
his
grey
head
,
was
*NL*
mingled
with
commiseration
for
his
faith
in
those
who
were
treacherous
*NL*
to
him
,
and
with
resentment
against
those
who
injured
him
.
The
impending
*NL*
shadow
of
a
great
affliction
,
and
a
great
disgrace
that
had
no
distinct
*NL*
form
in
it
yet
,
fell
like
a
stain
upon
the
quiet
place
where
I
had
*NL*
worked
and
played
as
a
boy
,
and
did
it
a
cruel
wrong
.
I
had
no
pleasure
*NL*
in
thinking
,
any
more
,
of
the
grave
old
broad-leaved
aloe-trees
which
*NL*
remained
shut
up
in
themselves
a
hundred
years
together
,
and
of
the
trim
*NL*
smooth
grass-plot
,
and
the
stone
urns
,
and
the
Doctor
's
walk
,
and
the
*NL*
congenial
sound
of
the
Cathedral
bell
hovering
above
them
all
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
the
tranquil
sanctuary
of
my
boyhood
had
been
sacked
before
my
face
,
*NL*
and
its
peace
and
honor
given
to
the
winds
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
morning
brought
with
it
my
parting
from
the
old
house
,
which
Agnes
*NL*
had
filled
with
her
influence
;
and
that
occupied
my
mind
sufficiently
.
*NL*
I
should
be
there
again
soon
,
no
doubt
;
I
might
sleep
again
--
perhaps
*NL*
often
--
in
my
old
room
;
but
the
days
of
my
inhabiting
there
were
gone
,
*NL*
and
the
old
time
was
past
.
I
was
heavier
at
heart
when
I
packed
up
such
*NL*
of
my
books
and
clothes
as
still
remained
there
to
be
sent
to
Dover
,
*NL*
than
I
cared
to
show
to
Uriah
Heep
:
who
was
so
officious
to
help
me
,
*NL*
that
I
uncharitably
thought
him
mighty
glad
that
I
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
away
from
Agnes
and
her
father
,
somehow
,
with
an
indifferent
show
*NL*
of
being
very
manly
,
and
took
my
seat
upon
the
box
of
the
London
coach
.
*NL*
I
was
so
softened
and
forgiving
,
going
through
the
town
,
that
I
had
half
*NL*
a
mind
to
nod
to
my
old
enemy
the
butcher
,
and
throw
him
five
shillings
*NL*
to
drink
.
But
he
looked
such
a
very
obdurate
butcher
as
he
stood
*NL*
scraping
the
great
block
in
the
shop
,
and
moreover
,
his
appearance
was
*NL*
so
little
improved
by
the
loss
of
a
front
tooth
which
I
had
knocked
out
,
*NL*
that
I
thought
it
best
to
make
no
advances
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
main
object
on
my
mind
,
I
remember
,
when
we
got
fairly
on
the
road
,
*NL*
was
to
appear
as
old
as
possible
to
the
coachman
,
and
to
speak
extremely
*NL*
gruff
.
The
latter
point
I
achieved
at
great
personal
inconvenience
;
but
*NL*
I
stuck
to
it
,
because
I
felt
it
was
a
grown-up
sort
of
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
through
,
sir
?
''
said
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
William
,
''
I
said
,
condescendingly
-LRB-
I
knew
him
-RRB-
;
``
I
am
going
to
*NL*
London
.
I
shall
go
down
into
Suffolk
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shooting
,
sir
?
''
said
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
as
well
as
I
did
that
it
was
just
as
likely
,
at
that
time
of
*NL*
year
,
I
was
going
down
there
whaling
;
but
I
felt
complimented
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
I
said
,
pretending
to
be
undecided
,
``
whether
I
shall
*NL*
take
a
shot
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Birds
is
got
wery
shy
,
I
'm
told
,
''
said
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
understand
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Suffolk
your
county
,
sir
?
''
asked
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
with
some
importance
,
``
Suffolk
's
my
county
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
told
the
dumplings
is
uncommon
fine
down
there
,
''
said
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
,
but
I
felt
it
necessary
to
uphold
the
*NL*
institutions
of
my
county
,
and
to
evince
a
familiarity
with
them
;
so
I
*NL*
shook

The
gentleman
spoken
of
was
a
gentleman
with
a
very
unpromising
squint
,
*NL*
and
a
prominent
chin
,
who
had
a
tall
white
hat
on
with
a
narrow
flat
*NL*
brim
,
and
whose
close-fitting
drab
trousers
seemed
to
button
all
the
way
*NL*
up
outside
his
legs
from
his
boots
to
his
hips
.
His
chin
was
cocked
over
*NL*
the
coachman
's
shoulder
,
so
near
to
me
,
that
his
breath
quite
tickled
*NL*
the
back
of
my
head
;
and
as
I
looked
round
at
him
,
he
leered
at
the
*NL*
leaders
with
the
eye
with
which
he
did
n't
squint
,
in
a
very
knowing
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
you
?
''
said
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
I
what
?
''
asked
the
gentleman
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bred
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so

said
the
gentleman
.
``
There
ai

*NL*
*NL*
``

it

''
said
William
in
my
ear
,
as
he
handled
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
construed
this
remark
into
an
indication
of
a
wish
that
he
should
have
*NL*
my
place
,
so
I
blushingly
offered
to
resign
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
sir
,
''
said
William
,
``
I
think
it
_
would
_
be
*NL*
more
correct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
always
considered
this
as
the
first
fall
I
had
in
life
.
When
I
*NL*
booked
my
place
at
the
coach-office
,
I
had
had
``
Box
Seat
''
written
*NL*
against
the
entry
,
and
had
given
the
book-keeper
half-a-crown
.
I
was
got
*NL*
up
in
a
special
great
coat
and
shawl
,
expressly
to
do
honor
to
that
*NL*
distinguished
eminence
;
had
glorified
myself
upon
it
a
good
deal
;
and
*NL*
had
felt
that
I
was
a
credit
to
the
coach
.
And
here
,
in
the
very
first
*NL*
stage
,
I
was
supplanted
by
a
shabby
man
with
a
squint
,
who
had
no
other
*NL*
merit
than
smelling
like
a
livery-stables
,
and
being
able
to
walk
across
*NL*
me
,
more
like
a
fly
than
a
human
being
,
while
the
horses
were
at
a
*NL*
canter
!
*NL*
*NL*

Illustration

My
first
fall
in
life
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
A
distrust
of
myself
,
which
has
often
beset
me
in
life
on
small
*NL*
occasions
,
when
it
would
have
been
better
away
,
was
assuredly
not
*NL*
stopped
in
its
growth
by
this
little
incident
outside
the
Canterbury
*NL*
coach
.
It
was
in
vain
to
take
refuge
in
gruffness
of
speech
.
I
spoke
*NL*
from
the
pit
of
my
stomach
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
but
I
felt
*NL*
completely
extinguished
,
and
dreadfully
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
curious
and
interesting
,
nevertheless
,
to
be
sitting
up
there
,
*NL*
behind
four
horses
:
well
educated
,
well
dressed
,
and
with
plenty
of
*NL*
money
in
my
pocket
:
and
to
look
out
for
the
places
where
I
had
slept
on
*NL*
my
weary
journey
.
I
had
abundant
occupation
for
my
thoughts
,
in
every
*NL*
conspicuous
landmark
on
the
road
.
When
I
looked
down
at
the
trampers
*NL*
whom
we
passed
,
and
saw
that
well-remembered
style
of
face
turned
up
,
I
*NL*
felt
as
if
the
tinker
's
blackened
hand
were
in
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
*NL*
again
.
When
we
clattered
through
the
narrow
street
of
Chatham
,
and
I
*NL*
caught
a
glimpse
,
in
passing
,
of
the
lane
where
the
old
monster
lived
*NL*
who
had
bought
my
jacket
,
I
stretched
my
neck
eagerly
to
look
for
the
*NL*
place
where
I
had
sat
,
in
the
sun
and
in
the
shade
,
waiting
for
my
*NL*
money
.
When
we
came
,
at
last
,
within
a
stage
of
London
,
and
passed
the
*NL*
veritable
Salem
House
where
Mr.
Creakle
had
laid
about
him
with
a
heavy
*NL*
hand
,
I
would
have
given
all
I
had
,
for
lawful
permission
to
get
down
*NL*
and
thrash
him
,
and
let
all
the
boys
out
like
so
many
caged
sparrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
to
the
Golden
Cross
at
Charing
Cross
,
then
a
mouldy
sort
of
*NL*
establishment
in
a
close
neighbourhood
.
A
waiter
showed
me
into
the
*NL*
coffee-room
;
and
a
chambermaid
introduced
me
to
my
small
bedchamber
,
*NL*
which
smelt
like
a
hackney-coach
,
and
was
shut
up
like
a
family
vault
.
I
*NL*
was
still
painfully
conscious
of
my
youth
,
for
nobody
stood
in
any
awe
*NL*
of
me
at
all
:
the
chambermaid
being
utterly
indifferent
to
my
opinions
*NL*
on
any
subject
,
and
the
waiter
being
familiar
with
me
,
and
offering
*NL*
advice
to
my
inexperience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
in
a
tone
of
confidence
,
``
what
would
you
*NL*
like
for
dinner
?
Young
gentlemen
likes
poultry
in
general
,
have
a
fowl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
,
as
majestically
as
I
could
,
that
I
was
n't
in
the
humour
for
*NL*
a
fowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
you
!
''
said
the
waiter
.
``
Young
gentlemen
is
generally
tired
of
*NL*
beef
and
mutton
,
have
a
weal
cutlet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assented
to
this
proposal
,
in
default
of
being
able
to
suggest
*NL*
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
care
for
taters
?
''
said
the
waiter
,
with
an
insinuating
smile
,
*NL*
and
his
head
on
one
side
.
``
Young
gentlemen
generally
has
been
overdosed
*NL*
with
taters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
commanded
him
,
in
my
deepest
voice
,
to
order
a
veal
cutlet
and
*NL*
potatoes
,
and
all
things
fitting
;
and
to
inquire
at
the
bar
if
there
*NL*
were
any
letters
for
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
Esquire
--
which
I
knew
there
*NL*
were
not
,
and
could
n't
be
,
but
thought
it
manly
to
appear
to
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
came
back
to
say
that
there
were
none
-LRB-
at
which
I
was
much
*NL*
surprised
-RRB-
,
and
began
to
lay
the
cloth
for
my
dinner
in
a
box
by
the
*NL*
fire
.
While
he
was
so
engaged
,
he
asked
me
what
I
would
take
with
it
;
*NL*
and
on
my
replying
``
Half
a
pint
of
sherry
,
''
thought
it
a
favourable
*NL*
opportunity
,
I
am
afraid
,
to
extract
that
measure
of
wine
from
the
stale
*NL*
leavings
at
the
bottoms
of
several
small
decanters
.
I
am
of
this
*NL*
opinion
,
because
,
while
I
was
reading
the
newspaper
,
I
observed
him
*NL*
behind
a
low
wooden
partition
,
which
was
his
private
apartment
,
very
*NL*
busy
pouring
out
of
a
number
of
those
vessels
into
one
,
like
a
chemist
*NL*
and
druggist
making
up
a
prescription
.
When
the
wine
came
,
too
,
I
*NL*
thought
it
flat
;
and
it
certainly
had
more
English
crumbs
in
it
,
than
*NL*
were
to
be
expected
in
a
foreign
wine
in
anything
like
a
pure
state
;
but
*NL*
I
was
bashful
enough
to
drink
it
,
and
say
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
,
then
,
in
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
-LRB-
from
which
I
infer
that
*NL*
poisoning
is
not
always
disagreeable
in
some
stages
of
the
process
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
resolved
to
go
to
the
play
.
It
was
Covent
Garden
Theatre
that
I
chose
;
*NL*
and
there
,
from
the
back
of
a
centre
box
,
I
saw
Julius
Caesar
and
the
*NL*
new
Pantomime
.
To
have
all
those
noble
Romans
alive
before
me
,
and
*NL*
walking
in
and
out
for
my
entertainment
,
instead
of
being
the
stern
*NL*
taskmasters
they
had
been
at
school
,
was
a
most
novel
and
delightful
*NL*
effect
.
But
the
mingled
reality
and
mystery
of
the
whole
show
,
the
*NL*
influence
upon
me
of
the
poetry
,
the
lights
,
the
music
,
the
company
,
*NL*
the
smooth
stupendous
changes
of
glittering
and
brilliant
scenery
,
were
*NL*
so
dazzling
,
and
opened
up
such
illimitable
regions
of
delight
,
that
*NL*
when
I
came
out
into
the
rainy
street
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
*NL*
I
felt
as
if
I
had
come
from
the
clouds
,
where
I
had
been
leading
*NL*
a
romantic
life
for
ages
,
to
a
bawling
,
splashing
,
link-lighted
,
*NL*
umbrella-struggling
,
hackney-coach-jostling
,
patten-clinking
,
muddy
,
*NL*
miserable
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
emerged
by
another
door
,
and
stood
in
the
street
for
a
little
*NL*
while
,
as
if
I
really
were
a
stranger
upon
earth
:
but
the
unceremonious
*NL*
pushing
and
hustling
that
I
received
,
soon
recalled
me
to
myself
,
and
*NL*
put
me
in
the
road
back
to
the
hotel
;
whither
I
went
,
revolving
the
*NL*
glorious
vision
all
the
way
;
and
where
,
after
some
porter
and
oysters
,
*NL*
I
sat
revolving
it
still
,
at
past
one
o'clock
,
with
my
eyes
on
the
*NL*
coffee-room
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
filled
with
the
play
,
and
with
the
past
--
for
it
was
,
in
a
*NL*
manner
,
like
a
shining
transparency
,
through
which
I
saw
my
earlier
*NL*
life
moving
along
--
that
I
do
n't
know
when
the
figure
of
a
handsome
*NL*
well-formed
young
man
,
dressed
with
a
tasteful
easy
negligence
which
*NL*
I
have
reason
to
remember
very
well
,
became
a
real
presence
to
me
.
But
*NL*
I
recollect
being
conscious
of
his
company
without
having
noticed
his
*NL*
coming
in
--
and
my
still
sitting
,
musing
,
over
the
coffee-room
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
rose
to
go
to
bed
,
much
to
the
relief
of
the
sleepy
waiter
,
*NL*
who
had
got
the
fidgets
in
his
legs
,
and
was
twisting
them
,
and
hitting
*NL*
them
,
and
putting
them
through
all
kinds
of
contortions
in
his
small
*NL*
pantry
.
In
going
towards
the
door
,
I
passed
the
person
who
had
come
in
,
*NL*
and
saw
him
plainly
.
I
turned
directly
,
came
back
,
and
looked
again
.
He
*NL*
did
not
know
me
,
but
I
knew
him
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
I
might
have
wanted
the
confidence
or
the
decision
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
and
might
have
put
it
off
until
next
day
,
and
might
have
*NL*
lost
him
.
But
,
in
the
then
condition
of
my
mind
,
where
the
play
was
*NL*
still
running
high
,
his
former
protection
of
me
appeared
so
deserving
of
*NL*
my
gratitude
,
and
my
old
love
for
him
overflowed
my
breast
so
freshly
*NL*
and
spontaneously
,
that
I
went
up
to
him
at
once
,
with
a
fast-beating
*NL*
heart
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Steerforth
!
wo
n't
you
speak
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
--
just
as
he
used
to
look
,
sometimes
--
but
I
saw
no
*NL*
recognition
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
remember
me
,
I
am
afraid
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
.
``
It
's
little
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
grasped
him
by
both
hands
,
and
could
not
let
them
go
.
But
for
very
*NL*
shame
,
and
the
fear
that
it
might
displease
him
,
I
could
have
held
him
*NL*
round
the
neck
and
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
,
never
,
never
was
so
glad
!
My
dear
Steerforth
,
I
am
so
*NL*
overjoyed
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
too
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
my
hands
heartily
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
Copperfield
,
old
boy
,
do
n't
be
overpowered
!
''
And
yet
he
was
glad
,
*NL*
too
,
I
thought
,
to
see
how
the
delight
I
had
in
meeting
him
affected
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
brushed
away
the
tears
that
my
utmost
resolution
had
not
been
able
to
*NL*
keep
back
,
and
I
made
a
clumsy
laugh
of
it
,
and
we
sat
down
together
,
*NL*
side
by
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
do
you
come
to
be
here
?
''
said
Steerforth
,
clapping
me
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
here
by
the
Canterbury
coach
,
to-day
.
I
have
been
adopted
by
an
*NL*
aunt
down
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
and
have
just
finished
my
*NL*
education
there
.
How
do
_
you
_
come
to
be
here
,
Steerforth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
what
they
call
an
Oxford
man
,
''
he
returned
;
``
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
I
get
bored
to
death
down
there
,
periodically
--
and
I
am
on
my
way
now
to
*NL*
my
mother
's
.
You
're
a
devilish
amiable-looking
fellow

Just
*NL*
what
you
used

be

now
I
look

Not
altered

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
_
you
_
immediately
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
you
are
more
easily

remembered

*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
as
he
ran
his
hand
through
the
clustering
curls
of
his
hair
,
*NL*
and
said
gaily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
on
an
expedition
of
duty
.
My
mother
lives
a
little
way
out
of
*NL*
town
;
and
the
roads
being
in
a
beastly
condition
,
and
our
house
tedious
*NL*
enough
,
I
remained
here
to-night
instead
of
going
on
.
I
have
not
been
in
*NL*
town
half-a-dozen
hours
,
and
those
I
have
been
dozing
and
grumbling
away
*NL*
at
the
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
at
the
play
,
too
,
''
said
I.
``
At
Covent
Garden
.
What
a
*NL*
delightful
and
magnificent
entertainment
,
Steerforth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
``
My
dear
young
Davy
,
''
he
said
,
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
``
you
*NL*
are
a
very
Daisy
.
The
daisy
of
the
field
,
at
sunrise
,
is
not
fresher
*NL*
than
you
are
!
I
have
been
at
Covent
Garden
,
too
,
and
there
never
was
a
*NL*
more
miserable
business
.
--
Holloa
,
you
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
addressed
to
the
waiter
,
who
had
been
very
attentive
to
our
*NL*
recognition
,
at
a
distance
,
and
now
came
forward
deferentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
put
my
friend
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
does
he
sleep
?
What
's
his
number
?
You
know
what
I
mean
,
''
said
*NL*
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
with
an
apologetic
air
.
``
Mr.
Copperfield
*NL*
is
at
present
in
forty-four
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
,
''
retorted
Steerforth
,
``
by
putting
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
into
a
little
loft
over
a
stable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
we
was
n't
aware
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
waiter
,
still
*NL*
apologetically
,
``
as
Mr.
Copperfield
was
anyways
particular
.
We
can
give
*NL*
Mr.
Copperfield
seventy-two
,
sir
,
if
it
would
be
preferred
.
Next
you
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
would
be
preferred
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
And
do
it
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
immediately
withdrew
to
make
the
exchange
.
Steerforth
,
very
*NL*
much
amused
at
my
having
been
put
into
forty-four
,
laughed
again
,
and
*NL*
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
and
invited
me
to
breakfast
with
him
*NL*
next
morning
at
ten
o'clock
--
an
invitation
I
was
only
too
proud
and
*NL*
happy
to
accept
.
It
being
now
pretty
late
,
we
took
our
candles
and
went
*NL*
up-stairs
,
where
we
parted
with
friendly
heartiness
at
his
door
,
and
*NL*
where
I
found
my
new
room
a
great
improvement
on
my
old
one
,
it
not
*NL*
being
at
all
musty
,
and
having
an
immense
four-post
bedstead
in
it
,
*NL*
which
was
quite
a
little
landed
estate
.
Here
,
among
pillows
enough
for
*NL*
six
,
I
soon
fell
asleep
in
a
blissful
condition
,
and
dreamed
of
ancient
*NL*
Rome
,
Steerforth
,
and
friendship
,
until
the
early
morning
coaches
,
*NL*
rumbling
out
of
the
archway
underneath
,
made
me
dream
of
thunder
and
the
*NL*
gods
.

CHAPTER
XX
.
*NL*
*NL*
STEERFORTH
'S
HOME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
chambermaid
tapped
at
my
door
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
informed
me
*NL*
that
my
shaving-water
was
outside
,
I
felt
severely
the
having
no
*NL*
occasion
for
it
,
and
blushed
in
my
bed
.
The
suspicion
that
she
laughed
*NL*
too
,
when
she
said
it
,
preyed
upon
my
mind
all
the
time
I
was
dressing
;
*NL*
and
gave
me
,
I
was
conscious
,
a
sneaking
and
guilty
air
when
I
passed
*NL*
her
on
the
staircase
,
as
I
was
going
down
to
breakfast
.
I
was
so
*NL*
sensitively
aware
,
indeed
,
of
being
younger
than
I
could
have
wished
,
*NL*
that
for
some
time
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
pass
her
at
all
,
under
*NL*
the
ignoble
circumstances
of
the
case
;
but
,
hearing
her
there
with
a
*NL*
broom
,
stood
peeping
out
of
window
at
King
Charles
on
horseback
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
maze
of
hackney-coaches
and
looking
anything
but
regal
*NL*
in
a
drizzling
rain
and
a
dark-brown
fog
,
until
I
was
admonished
by
the
*NL*
waiter
that
the
gentleman
was
waiting
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
in
the
coffee-room
that
I
found
Steerforth
expecting
me
,
but
*NL*
in
a
snug
private
apartment
,
red-curtained
and
Turkey-carpeted
,
where
*NL*
the
fire
burnt
bright
,
and
a
fine
hot
breakfast
was
set
forth
on
a
table
*NL*
covered
with
a
clean
cloth
;
and
a
cheerful
miniature
of
the
room
,
the
*NL*
fire
,
the
breakfast
,
Steerforth
,
and
all
,
was
shining
in
the
little
*NL*
round
mirror
over
the
sideboard
.
I
was
rather
bashful
at
first
,
*NL*
Steerforth
being
so
self-possessed
,
and
elegant
,
and
superior
to
me
in
*NL*
all
respects
-LRB-
age
included
-RRB-
;
but
his
easy
patronage
soon
put
that
to
*NL*
rights
,
and
made
me
quite
at
home
.
I
could
not
enough
admire
the
change
*NL*
he
had
wrought
in
the
Golden
Cross
;
or
compare
the
dull
forlorn
state
I
*NL*
had
held
yesterday
,
with
this
morning
's
comfort
and
this
morning
's
*NL*
entertainment
.
As
to
the
waiter
's
familiarity
,
it
was
quenched
as
if
it
*NL*
had
never
been
.
He
attended
on
us
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Copperfield
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
when
we
were
alone
,
``
I
should
like
*NL*
to
hear
what
you
are
doing
,
and
where
you
are
going
,
and
all
about
you
.
*NL*
I
feel
as
if
you
were
my
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Glowing
with
pleasure
to
find
that
he
had
still
this
interest
in
me
,
I
*NL*
told
him
how
my
aunt
had
proposed
the
little
expedition
that
I
had
*NL*
before
me
,
and
whither
it
tended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
are
in
no
hurry
,
then
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
come
home
with
me
to
*NL*
Highgate
,
and
stay
a
day
or
two
.
You
will
be
pleased
with
my
mother
--
she
*NL*
is
a
little
vain
and
prosy
about
me
,
but
that
you
can
forgive
her
--
and
*NL*
she
will
be
pleased
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
be
as
sure
of
that
,
as
you
are
kind
enough
to
say
you
*NL*
are
,
''
I
answered
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
every
one
who
likes
me
,
has
a
claim
on
her
that
*NL*
is
sure
to
be
acknowledged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
think
I
shall
be
a
favorite
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Come
and
prove
it
.
We
will
go
and
see
the
*NL*
lions
for
an
hour
or
two
--
it
's
something
to
have
a
fresh
fellow
like
you
*NL*
to
show
them
to
,
Copperfield
--
and
then
we
'll
journey
out
to
Highgate
by
*NL*
the
coach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hardly
believe
but
that
I
was
in
a
dream
,
and
that
I
should
wake
*NL*
presently
in
number
forty-four
,
to
the
solitary
box
in
the
coffee-room
*NL*
and
the
familiar
waiter
again
.
After
I
had
written
to
my
aunt
and
told
*NL*
her
of
my
fortunate
meeting
with
my
admired
old
schoolfellow
,
and
my
*NL*
acceptance
of
his
invitation
,
we
went
out
in
a
hackney-chariot
,
and
saw
*NL*
a
Panorama
and
some
other
sights
,
and
took
a
walk
through
the
Museum
,
*NL*
where
I
could
not
help
observing
how
much
Steerforth
knew
,
on
an
*NL*
infinite
variety
of
subjects
,
and
of
how
little
account
he
seemed
to
*NL*
make
his
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
take
a
high
degree
at
college
,
Steerforth
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
you
have
*NL*
not
done
so
already
;
and
they
will
have
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
take
a
degree
!
''
cried
Steerforth
.
``
Not
I
!
my
dear
Daisy
--
will
you
*NL*
mind
my
calling
you
Daisy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
fellow
!
My
dear
Daisy
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
laughing
,
``
I
*NL*
have
not
the
least
desire
or
intention
to
distinguish
myself
in
that
*NL*
way
.
I
have
done
quite
sufficient
for
my
purpose
.
I
find
that
I
am
heavy
*NL*
company
enough
for
myself
,
as
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
fame
--
''
I
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
romantic
Daisy
!
''
said
Steerforth
,
laughing
still
more
heartily
;
*NL*
``
why
should
I
trouble
myself
,
that
a
parcel
of
heavy-headed
fellows
may
*NL*
gape
and
hold
up
their
hands
?
Let
them
do
it
at
some
other
man
.
There
's
*NL*
fame
for
him
,
and
he
's
welcome
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
abashed
at
having
made
so
great
a
mistake
,
and
was
glad
to
change
*NL*
the
subject
.
Fortunately
it
was
not
difficult
to
do
,
for
Steerforth
*NL*
could
always
pass
from
one
subject
to
another
with
a
carelessness
and
*NL*
lightness
that
were
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lunch
succeeded
to
our
sight-seeing
,
and
the
short
winter
day
wore
away
*NL*
so
fast
,
that
it
was
dusk
when
the
stage-coach
stopped
with
us
at
an
old
*NL*
brick
house
at
Highgate
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
An
elderly
lady
,
*NL*
though
not
very
far
advanced
in
years
,
with
a
proud
carriage
and
a
*NL*
handsome
face
,
was
in
the
doorway
as
we
alighted
;
and
greeting
*NL*
Steerforth
as
``
My
dearest
James
,
''
folded
him
in
her
arms
.
To
this
lady
*NL*
he
presented
me
as
his
mother
,
and
she
gave
me
a
stately
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
genteel
old-fashioned
house
,
very
quiet
and
orderly
.
From
the
*NL*
windows
of
my
room
I
saw
all
London
lying
in
the
distance
like
a
great
*NL*
vapour
,
with
here
and
there
some
lights
twinkling
through
it
.
I
had
only
*NL*
time
,
in
dressing
,
to
glance
at
the
solid
furniture
,
the
framed
pieces
*NL*
of
work
-LRB-
done
,
I
supposed
,
by
Steerforth
's
mother
when
she
was
a
girl
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
some
pictures
in
crayons
of
ladies
with
powdered
hair
and
boddices
,
*NL*
coming
and
going
on
the
walls
,
as
the
newly-kindled
fire
crackled
and
*NL*
sputtered
,
when
I
was
called
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
second
lady
in
the
dining-room
,
of
a
slight
short
figure
,
*NL*
dark
,
and
not
agreeable
to
look
at
,
but
with
some
appearance
of
good
*NL*
looks
too
,
who
attracted
my
attention
:
perhaps
because
I
had
not
*NL*
expected
to
see
her
;
perhaps
because
I
found
myself
sitting
opposite
*NL*
to
her
;
perhaps
because
of
something
really
remarkable
in
her
.
She
had
*NL*
black
hair
and
eager
black
eyes
,
and
was
thin
,
and
had
a
scar
upon
her
*NL*
lip
.
It
was
an
old
scar
--
I
should
rather
call
it
,
seam
,
for
it
was
not
*NL*
discolored
,
and
had
healed
years
ago
--
which
had
once
cut
through
her
*NL*
mouth
,
downward
towards
the
chin
,
but
was
now
barely
visible
across
*NL*
the
table
,
except
above
and
on
her
upper
lip
,
the
shape
of
which
it
*NL*
had
altered
.
I
concluded
in
my
own
mind
that
she
was
about
thirty
*NL*
years
of
age
,
and
that
she
wished
to
be
married
.
She
was
a
little
*NL*
dilapidated
--
like
a
house
--
with
having
been
so
long
to
let
;
yet
had
,
as
*NL*
I
have
said
,
an
appearance
of
good
looks
.
Her
thinness
seemed
to
be
the
*NL*
effect
of
some
wasting
fire
within
her
,
which
found
a
vent
in
her
gaunt
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
introduced
as
Miss
Dartle
,
and
both
Steerforth
and
his
mother
*NL*
called
her
Rosa
.
I
found
that
she
lived
there
,
and
had
been
for
a
long
*NL*
time
Mrs.
Steerforth
's
companion
.
It
appeared
to
me
that
she
never
said
*NL*
anything
she
wanted
to
say
,
outright
;
but
hinted
it
,
and
made
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
of
it
by
this
practice
.
For
example
,
when
Mrs.
Steerforth
*NL*
observed
,
more
in
jest
than
earnest
,
that
she
feared
her
son
led
but
a
*NL*
wild
life
at
college
,
Miss
Dartle
put
in
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
really
?
You
know
how
ignorant
I
am
,
and
that
I
only
ask
for
*NL*
information
,
but
is
n't
it
always
so
?
I
thought
that
kind
of
life
was
on
*NL*
all
hands
understood
to
be
--
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
education
for
a
very
grave
profession
,
if
you
mean
that
,
Rosa
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
answered
with
some
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Yes
!
That
's
very
true
,
''
returned
Miss
Dartle
.
``
But
is
n't
it
,
*NL*
though
?
--
I
want
to
be
put
right
if
I
am
wrong
--
is
n't
it
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
what
?
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
mean
it
's
_
not
_
!
''
returned
Miss
Dartle
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
very
glad
to
*NL*
hear
it
!
Now
,
I
know
what
to
do
.
That
's
the
advantage
of
asking
.
I
shall
*NL*
never
allow
people
to
talk
before
me
about
wastefulness
and
profligacy
,
*NL*
and
so
forth
,
in
connection
with
that
life
,
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
be
right
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
``
My
son
's
tutor
is
a
*NL*
conscientious
gentleman
;
and
if
I
had
not
implicit
reliance
on
my
son
,
I
*NL*
should
have
reliance
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
?
''
said
Miss
Dartle
.
``
Dear
me
!
Conscientious
,
is
he
?
Really
*NL*
conscientious
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
convinced
of
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
nice
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Dartle
.
``
What
a
comfort
!
Really
*NL*
conscientious
?
Then
he
's
not
--
but
of
course
he
ca
n't
be
,
if
he
's
really
*NL*
conscientious
.
Well
,
I
shall
be
quite
happy
in
my
opinion
of
him
,
from
*NL*
this
time
.
You
ca
n't
think
how
it
elevates
him
in
my
opinion
,
to
know
*NL*
for
certain
that
he
's
really
conscientious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
own
views
of
every
question
,
and
her
correction
of
everything
that
*NL*
was
said
to
which
she
was
opposed
,
Miss
Dartle
insinuated
in
the
same
*NL*
way
:
sometimes
,
I
could
not
conceal
from
myself
,
with
great
power
,
*NL*
though
in
contradiction
even
of
Steerforth
.
An
instance
happened
before
*NL*
dinner
was
done
.
Mrs.
Steerforth
speaking
to
me
about
my
intention
of
*NL*
going
down
into
Suffolk
,
I
said
at
hazard
how
glad
I
should
be
,
if
*NL*
Steerforth
would
only
go
there
with
me
;
and
explaining
to
him
that
I
was
*NL*
going
to
see
my
old
nurse
,
and
Mr.
Peggotty
's
family
,
I
reminded
him
of
*NL*
the
boatman
whom
he
had
seen
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
That
bluff
fellow
!
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
He
had
a
son
with
him
,
had
n't
*NL*
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
That
was
his
nephew
,
''
I
replied
;
``
whom
he
adopted
,
though
,
as
a
*NL*
son
.
He
has
a
very
pretty
little
niece
too
,
whom
he
adopted
as
a
*NL*
daughter
.
In
short
,
his
house
-LRB-
or
rather
his
boat
,
for
he
lives
in
one
,
*NL*
on
dry
land
-RRB-
is
full
of
people
who
are
objects
of
his
generosity
and
*NL*
kindness
.
You
would
be
delighted
to
see
that
household
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
I
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Well
,
I
think
I
should
.
I
must
see
what
*NL*
can
be
done
.
It
would
be
worth
a
journey
--
not
to
mention
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
a
journey
with
you
,
Daisy
,
--
to
see
that
sort
of
people
together
,
and
to
*NL*
make
one
of
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
leaped
with
a
new
hope
of
pleasure
.
But
it
was
in
reference
to
*NL*
the
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
``
that
sort
of
people
,
''
that
Miss
*NL*
Dartle
,
whose
sparkling
eyes
had
been
watchful
of
us
,
now
broke
in
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
really
?
Do
tell
me
.
Are
they
,
though
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
what
?
And
are
who
what
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sort
of
people
.
--
Are
they
really
animals
and
clods
,
and
beings
of
*NL*
another
order
?
I
want
to
know
_
so
_
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
a
pretty
wide
separation
between
them
and
us
,
''
said
*NL*
Steerforth
,
with
indifference
.
``
They
are
not
to
be
expected
to
be
as
*NL*
sensitive
as
we
are
.
Their
delicacy
is
not
to
be
shocked
,
or
hurt
very
*NL*
easily
.
They
are
wonderfully
virtuous
,
I
dare
say
--
some
people
contend
*NL*
for
that
,
at
least
;
and
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
contradict
them
--
but
*NL*
they
have
not
very
fine
natures
,
and
they
may
be
thankful
that
,
like
*NL*
their
coarse
rough
skins
,
they
are
not
easily
wounded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
said
Miss
Dartle
.
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
now
,
when
I
have
been
*NL*
better
pleased
than
to
hear
that
.
It
's
so
consoling
!
It
's
such
a
delight
*NL*
to
know
that
,
when
they
suffer
,
they
do
n't
feel
!
Sometimes
I
have
been
*NL*
quite
uneasy
for
that
sort
of
people
;
but
now
I
shall
just
dismiss
the
*NL*
idea
of
them
,
altogether
.
Live
and
learn
.
I
had
my
doubts
,
I
confess
,
*NL*
but
now
they
're
cleared
up
.
I
did
n't
know
,
and
now
I
do
know
;
and
that
*NL*
shows
the
advantage
of
asking
--
do
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believed
that
Steerforth
had
said
what
he
had
,
in
jest
,
or
to
draw
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
out
;
and
I
expected
him
to
say
as
much
when
she
was
gone
,
*NL*
and
we
two
were
sitting
before
the
fire
.
But
he
merely
asked
me
what
I
*NL*
thought
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
clever
,
is
she
not
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clever
!
She
brings
everything
to
a
grindstone
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
and
*NL*
sharpens
it
,
as
she
has
sharpened
her
own
face
and
figure
these
years
*NL*
past
.
She
has
worn
herself
away
by
constant
sharpening
.
She
is
all
*NL*
edge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
remarkable
scar
that
is
upon
her
lip
!
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
's
face
fell
,
and
he
paused
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
''
he
returned
,
''
--
_
I
_
did
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
an
unfortunate
accident
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
was
a
young
boy
,
and
she
exasperated
me
,
and
I
threw
a
hammer
at
*NL*
her
.
A
promising
young
angel
I
must
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
deeply
sorry
to
have
touched
on
such
a
painful
theme
,
but
that
was
*NL*
useless
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
borne
the
mark
ever
since
,
as
you
see
,
''
said
Steerforth
;
``
and
*NL*
she
'll
bear
it
to
her
grave
,
if
she
ever
rests
in
one
--
though
I
can
*NL*
hardly
believe
she
will
ever
rest
anywhere
.
She
was
the
motherless
child
*NL*
of
a
sort
of
cousin
of
my
father
's
.
He
died
one
day
.
My
mother
,
who
was
*NL*
then
a
widow
,
brought
her
here
to
be
company
to
her
.
She
has
a
couple
of
*NL*
thousand
pounds
of
her
own
,
and
saves
the
interest
of
it
every
year
,
to
*NL*
add
to
the
principal
.
There
's
the
history
of
Miss
Rosa
Dartle
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
no
doubt
she
loves
you
like
a
brother
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!
''
retorted
Steerforth
,
looking
at
the
fire
.
``
Some
brothers
are
*NL*
not
loved
over
much
;
and
some
love
--
but
help
yourself
,
Copperfield
!
*NL*
We
'll
drink
the
daisies
of
the
field
,
in
compliment
to
you
;
and
the
*NL*
lilies
of
the
valley
that
toil
not
,
neither
do
they
spin
,
in
compliment
*NL*
to
me
--
the
more
shame
for
me
!
''
A
moody
smile
that
had
overspread
his
*NL*
features
cleared
off
as
he
said
this
merrily
,
and
he
was
his
own
frank
,
*NL*
winning
self
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
glancing
at
the
scar
with
a
painful
interest
when
we
*NL*
went
in
to
tea
.
It
was
not
long
before
I
observed
that
it
was
the
most
*NL*
susceptible
part
of
her
face
,
and
that
,
when
she
turned
pale
,
that
mark
*NL*
altered
first
,
and
became
a
dull
,
lead-colored
streak
,
lengthening
out
*NL*
to
its
full
extent
,
like
a
mark
in
invisible
ink
brought
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
There
was
a
little
altercation
between
her
and
Steerforth
about
a
cast
*NL*
of
the
dice
at
backgammon
--
when
I
thought
her
,
for
one
moment
,
in
a
*NL*
storm
of
rage
;
and
then
I
saw
it
start
forth
like
the
old
writing
on
the
*NL*
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
matter
of
wonder
to
me
to
find
Mrs.
Steerforth
devoted
to
*NL*
her
son
.
She
seemed
to
be
able
to
speak
or
think
about
nothing
else
.
*NL*
She
showed
me
his
picture
as
an
infant
,
in
a
locket
,
with
some
of
his
*NL*
baby-hair
in
it
;
she
showed
me
his
picture
as
he
had
been
when
I
first
*NL*
knew
him
;
and
she
wore
at
her
breast
his
picture
as
he
was
now
.
All
*NL*
the
letters
he
had
ever
written
to
her
,
she
kept
in
a
cabinet
near
her
*NL*
own
chair
by
the
fire
;
and
she
would
have
read
me
some
of
them
,
and
I
*NL*
should
have
been
very
glad
to
hear
them
too
,
if
he
had
not
interposed
,
*NL*
and
coaxed
her
out
of
the
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
at
Mr.
Creakle
's
,
my
son
tells
me
,
that
you
first
became
*NL*
acquainted

''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
as
she
and
I
were
talking
at
one
*NL*
table
,
while
they
played
backgammon
at
another
.
``
Indeed
,
I
recollect
his
*NL*
speaking
,
at
that
time
,
of
a
pupil
younger
than
himself
who
had
taken
*NL*
his
fancy
there
;
but
your
name
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
has
not
lived
in
my
*NL*
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
very
generous
and
noble
to
me
in
those
days
,
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
I
stood
in
need
of
such
a
friend
.
I
should
have
*NL*
been
quite
crushed
without
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
always
generous
and
noble
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
subscribed
to
this
with
all
my
heart
,
God
knows
.
She
knew
I
did
;
for
*NL*
the
stateliness
of
her
manner
already
abated
towards
me
,
except
when
she
*NL*
spoke
in
praise
of
him
,
and
then
her
air
was
always
lofty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
a
fit
school
generally
for
my
son
,
''
said
she
;
``
far
from
it
;
*NL*
but
there
were
particular
circumstances
to
be
considered
at
the
time
,
of
*NL*
more
importance
even
than
that
selection
.
My
son
's
high
spirit
made
it
*NL*
desirable
that
he
should
be
placed
with
some
man
who
felt
its
*NL*
superiority
,
and
would
be
content
to
bow
himself
before
it
;
and
we
found
*NL*
such
a
man
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
,
knowing
the
fellow
.
And
yet
I
did
not
despise
him
the
more
*NL*
for
it
,
but
thought
it
a
redeeming
quality
in
him
--
if
he
could
be
*NL*
allowed
any
grace
for
not
resisting
one
so
irresistible
as
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
's
great
capacity
was
tempted
on
,
there
,
by
a
feeling
of
*NL*
voluntary
emulation
and
conscious
pride
,
''
the
fond
lady
went
on
to
say
.
*NL*
``
He
would
have
risen
against
all
constraint
;
but
he
found
himself
the
*NL*
monarch
of
the
place
,
and
he
haughtily
determined
to
be
worthy
of
his
*NL*
station
.
It
was
like
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
echoed
,
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
,
that
it
was
like
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
my
son
took
,
of
his
own
will
,
and
on
no
compulsion
,
to
the
course
in
*NL*
which
he
can
always
,
when
it
is
his
pleasure
,
outstrip
every
*NL*
competitor
,
''
she
pursued
.
``
My
son
informs
me
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
that
you
*NL*
were
quite
devoted
to
him
,
and
that
when
you
met
yesterday
you
made
*NL*
yourself
known
to
him
with
tears
of
joy

I
should
be
an
affected
woman
*NL*
if
I
made
any
pretence
of
being
surprised
by
my
son
's
inspiring
such
*NL*
emotions
;
but
I
can
not
be
indifferent
to
any
one
who
is
so
sensible
of
*NL*
his
merit
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
here
,
and
can
assure
you
that
*NL*
he
feels
an
unusual
friendship
for
you
,

that
you
may
rely
on
his
*NL*
protection

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
played
backgammon
as
eagerly
as
she
did
everything
else
.
If
*NL*
I
had
seen
her
,
first
,
at
the
board
,
I
should
have
fancied
that
her
*NL*
figure
had
got
thin
,
and
her
eyes
had
got
large
,
over
that
pursuit
,
and
*NL*
no
other
in
the
world
.
But
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
she
missed
a
word
*NL*
of
this
,
or
lost
a
look
of
mine
as
I
received
it
with
the
utmost
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
,
honored
by
Mrs.
Steerforth
's
confidence
,
felt
older
than
*NL*
I
had
done
since
I
left
Canterbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
evening
was
pretty
far
spent
,
and
a
tray
of
glasses
and
*NL*
decanters
came
in
,
Steerforth
promised
,
over
the
fire
,
that
he
would
*NL*
seriously
think
of
going
down
into
the
country
with
me
.
There
was
no
*NL*
hurry
,
he
said
;
a
week
hence
would
do
;
and
his
mother
hospitably
said
*NL*
the
same
.
While
we
were
talking
,
he
more
than
once
called
me
Daisy
;
*NL*
which
brought
Miss
Dartle
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
really
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
she
asked
,
``
is
it
a
nick-name
?
And
why
*NL*
does
he
give
it
you
?
Is
it
--
eh
?
--
because
he
thinks
you
young
and
*NL*
innocent
?
I
am
so
stupid
in
these
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
colored
in
replying
that
I
believed
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Miss
Dartle
.
``
Now
I
am
glad
to
know
that
!
I
ask
for
*NL*
information

I
am
glad

He
thinks
you
young

innocent
;
*NL*
and
so
you
are
his
friend

Well
,
that
's
quite
delightful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
bed
soon
after
this
,
and
Mrs.
Steerforth
retired
too
.
*NL*
Steerforth
and
I
,
after
lingering
for
half
an
hour
over
the
fire
,
*NL*
talking
about
Traddles
and
all
the
rest
of
them
at
old
Salem
House
,
went
*NL*
up-stairs
together
.
Steerforth
's
room
was
next
to
mine
,
and
I
went
in
to
*NL*
look
at
it
.
It
was
a
picture
of
comfort
,
full
of
easy
chairs
,
cushions
*NL*
and
footstools
,
worked
by
his
mother
's
hand
,
and
with
no
sort
of
thing
*NL*
omitted
that
could
help
to
render
it
complete
.
Finally
,
her
handsome
*NL*
features
looked
down
on
her
darling
from
a
portrait
on
the
wall
,
as
if
*NL*
it
were
even
something
to
her
that
her
likeness
should
watch
him
while
*NL*
he
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
the
fire
burning
clear
enough
in
my
room
by
this
time
,
and
the
*NL*
curtains
drawn
before
the
windows
and
round
the
bed
,
giving
it
a
very
*NL*
snug
appearance
.
I
sat
down
in
a
great
chair
upon
the
hearth
to
meditate
*NL*
on
my
happiness
;
and
had
enjoyed
the
contemplation
of
it
for
some
time
,
*NL*
when
I
found
a
likeness
of
Miss
Dartle
looking
eagerly
at
me
from
above
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
startling
likeness
,
and
necessarily
had
a
startling
look
.
The
*NL*
painter
had
n't
made
the
scar
,
but
_
I
_
made
it
;
and
there
it
was
,
coming
*NL*
and
going
:
now
confined
to
the
upper
lip
as
I
had
seen
it
at
dinner
,
and
*NL*
now
showing
the
whole
extent
of
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
hammer
,
as
I
*NL*
had
seen
it
when
she
was
passionate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
peevishly
why
they
could
n't
put
her
anywhere
else
instead
of
*NL*
quartering
her
on
me
.
To
get
rid
of
her
,
I
undressed
quickly
,
*NL*
extinguished
my
light
,
and
went
to
bed
.
But
,
as
I
fell
asleep
,
I
could
*NL*
not
forget
that
she
was
still
there
looking
,
``
Is
it
really
,
though
?
I
*NL*
want
to
know
;
''
and
when
I
awoke
in
the
night
,
I
found
that
I
was
*NL*
uneasily
asking
all
sorts
of
people
in
my
dreams
whether
it
really
was
*NL*
or
not
--
without
knowing
what
I
meant
.

CHAPTER
XXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
LITTLE
EM
`
LY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
servant
in
that
house
,
a
man
who
,
I
understood
,
was
usually
*NL*
with
Steerforth
,
and
had
come
into
his
service
at
the
University
,
who
*NL*
was
in
appearance
a
pattern
of
respectability
.
I
believe
there
never
*NL*
existed
in
his
station
a
more
respectable-looking
man
.
He
was
taciturn
,
*NL*
soft-footed
,
very
quiet
in
his
manner
,
deferential
,
observant
,
always
at
*NL*
hand
when
wanted
,
and
never
near
when
not
wanted
;
but
his
great
claim
to
*NL*
consideration
was
his
respectability
.
He
had
not
a
pliant
face
,
he
had
*NL*
rather
a
stiff
neck
,
rather
a
tight
smooth
head
with
short
hair
clinging
*NL*
to
it
at
the
sides
,
a
soft
way
of
speaking
,
with
a
peculiar
habit
of
*NL*
whispering
the
letter
S
so
distinctly
,
that
he
seemed
to
use
it
oftener
*NL*
than
any
other
man
;
but
every
peculiarity
that
he
had
he
made
*NL*
respectable
.
If
his
nose
had
been
upside-down
,
he
would
have
made
that
*NL*
respectable
.
He
surrounded
himself
with
an
atmosphere
of
respectability
,
*NL*
and
walked
secure
in
it
.
It
would
have
been
next
to
impossible
to
*NL*
suspect
him
of
anything
wrong
,
he
was
so
thoroughly
respectable
.
Nobody
*NL*
could
have
thought
of
putting
him
in
a
livery
,
he
was
so
highly
*NL*
respectable
.
To
have
imposed
any
derogatory
work
upon
him
,
would
have
*NL*
been
to
inflict
a
wanton
insult
on
the
feelings
of
a
most
respectable
*NL*
man
.
And
of
this
,
I
noticed
the
women-servants
in
the
household
were
so
*NL*
intuitively
conscious
,
that
they
always
did
such
work
themselves
,
and
*NL*
generally
while
he
read
the
paper
by
the
pantry
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
self-contained
man
I
never
saw
.
But
in
that
quality
,
as
in
every
*NL*
other
he
possessed
,
he
only
seemed
to
be
the
more
respectable
.
Even
the
*NL*
fact
that
no
one
knew
his
Christian
name
,
seemed
to
form
a
part
of
his
*NL*
respectability
.
Nothing
could
be
objected
against
his
surname
Littimer
,
*NL*
by
which
he
was
known
.
Peter
might
have
been
hanged
,
or
Tom
transported
;
*NL*
but
Littimer
was
perfectly
respectable
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
occasioned
,
I
suppose
,
by
the
reverend
nature
of
respectability
*NL*
in
the
abstract
,
but
I
felt
particularly
young
in
this
man
's
presence
.
*NL*
How
old
he
was
himself
I
could
not
guess
--
and
that
again
went
to
his
*NL*
credit
on
the
same
score
;
for
in
the
calmness
of
respectability
he
might
*NL*
have
numbered
fifty
years
as
well
as
thirty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Littimer
was
in
my
room
in
the
morning
before
I
was
up
,
to
bring
me
that
*NL*
reproachful
shaving-water
,
and
to
put
out
my
clothes
.
When
I
undrew
the
*NL*
curtains
and
looked
out
of
bed
,
I
saw
him
,
in
an
equable
temperature
of
*NL*
respectability
,
unaffected
by
the
east
wind
of
January
,
and
not
even
*NL*
breathing
frostily
,
standing
my
boots
right
and
left
in
the
first
*NL*
dancing
position
,
and
blowing
specks
of
dust
off
my
coat
as
he
laid
it
*NL*
down
like
a
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
good
morning
,
and
asked
him
what
o'clock
it
was
.
He
took
out
*NL*
of
his
pocket
the
most
respectable
hunting-watch
I
ever
saw
,
and
*NL*
preventing
the
spring
with
his
thumb
from
opening
far
,
looked
in
at
the
*NL*
face
as
if
he
were
consulting
an
oracular
oyster
,
shut
it
up
again
,
and
*NL*
said
,
if
I
pleased
,
it
was
halfpast
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Steerforth
will
be
glad
to
hear
how
you
have
rested
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
I
,
``
very
well
indeed
.
Is
Mr.
Steerforth
quite
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
Mr.
Steerforth
is
tolerably
well
.
''
Another
of
his
*NL*
characteristics
,
--
no
use
of
superlatives
.
A
cool
calm
medium
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
more
I
can
have
the
honor
of
doing
for
you
,
sir
?
The
*NL*
warning-bell
will
ring
at
nine
;
the
family
take
breakfast
at
halfpast
*NL*
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
I
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
_
you
_
,
sir
,
if
you
please
;
''
and
with
that
,
and
with
a
little
*NL*
inclination
of
his
head
when
he
passed
the
bedside
,
as
an
apology
for
*NL*
correcting
me
,
he
went
out
,
shutting
the
door
as
delicately
as
if
I
had
*NL*
just
fallen
into
a
sweet
sleep
on
which
my
life
depended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
we
held
exactly
this
conversation
:
never
any
more
,
and
*NL*
never
any
less
:
and
yet
,
invariably
,
however
far
I
might
have
been
*NL*
lifted
out
of
myself
over-night
,
and
advanced
towards
maturer
years
,
by
*NL*
Steerforth
's
companionship
,
or
Mrs.
Steerforth
's
confidence
,
or
Miss
*NL*
Dartle
's
conversation
,
in
the
presence
of
this
most
respectable
man
I
*NL*
became
,
as
our
smaller
poets
sing
,
``
a
boy
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
horses
for
us
;
and
Steerforth
,
who
knew
every
thing
,
gave
me
*NL*
lessons
in
riding
.
He
provided
foils
for
us
,
and
Steerforth
gave
me
*NL*
lessons
in
fencing
--
gloves
,
and
I
began
,
of
the
same
master
,
to
improve
*NL*
in
boxing
.
It
gave
me
no
manner
of
concern
that
Steerforth
should
find
*NL*
me
a
novice
in
these
sciences
,
but
I
never
could
bear
to
show
my
want
of
*NL*
skill
before
the
respectable
Littimer
.
I
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
*NL*
Littimer
understood
such
arts
himself
;
he
never
led
me
to
suppose
*NL*
anything
of
the
kind
,
by
so
much
as
the
vibration
of
one
of
his
*NL*
respectable
eyelashes
;
yet
whenever
he
was
by
,
while
we
were
practising
,
*NL*
I
felt
myself
the
greenest
and
most
inexperienced
of
mortals
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
particular
about
this
man
,
because
he
made
a
particular
effect
on
*NL*
me
at
that
time
,
and
because
of
what
took
place
thereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
week
passed
away
in
a
most
delightful
manner
.
It
passed
rapidly
,
as
*NL*
may
be
supposed
,
to
one
entranced
as
I
was
;
and
yet
it
gave
me
so
many
*NL*
occasions
for
knowing
Steerforth
better
,
and
admiring
him
more
in
a
*NL*
thousand
respects
,
that
at
its
close
I
seemed
to
have
been
with
him
for
*NL*
a
much
longer
time
.
A
dashing
way
he
had
of
treating
me
like
a
*NL*
plaything
,
was
more
agreeable
to
me
than
any
behaviour
he
could
have
*NL*
adopted
.
It
reminded
me
of
our
old
acquaintance
;
it
seemed
the
natural
*NL*
sequel
of
it
;
it
showed
me
that
he
was
unchanged
;
it
relieved
me
of
any
*NL*
uneasiness
I
might
have
felt
,
in
comparing
my
merits
with
his
,
and
*NL*
measuring
my
claims
upon
his
friendship
by
any
equal
standard
;
above
*NL*
all
,
it
was
a
familiar
,
unrestrained
,
affectionate
demeanor
that
he
used
*NL*
towards
no
one
else
.
As
he
had
treated
me
at
school
differently
from
all
*NL*
the
rest
,
I
joyfully
believed
that
he
treated
me
in
life
unlike
any
*NL*
other
friend
he
had
.
I
believed
that
I
was
nearer
to
his
heart
than
any
*NL*
other
friend
,
and
my
own
heart
warmed
with
attachment
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
up
his
mind
to
go
with
me
into
the
country
,
and
the
day
arrived
*NL*
for
our
departure
.
He
had
been
doubtful
at
first
whether
to
take
*NL*
Littimer
or
not
,
but
decided
to
leave
him
at
home
.
The
respectable
*NL*
creature
,
satisfied
with
his
lot
whatever
it
was
,
arranged
our
*NL*
portmanteaus
on
the
little
carriage
that
was
to
take
us
into
London
,
as
*NL*
if
they
were
intended
to
defy
the
shocks
of
ages
;
and
received
my
*NL*
modestly
proffered
donation
with
perfect
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
bade
adieu
to
Mrs.
Steerforth
and
Miss
Dartle
,
with
many
thanks
on
my
*NL*
part
,
and
much
kindness
on
the
devoted
mother
's
.
The
last
thing
I
saw
*NL*
was
Littimer
's
unruffled
eye
;
fraught
,
as
I
fancied
,
with
the
silent
*NL*
conviction
that
I
was
very
young
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
felt
,
in
returning
so
auspiciously
to
the
old
familiar
places
,
I
*NL*
shall
not
endeavour
to
describe
.
We
went
down
by
the
Mail
.
I
was
so
*NL*
concerned
,
I
recollect
,
even
for
the
honor
of
Yarmouth
,
that
when
*NL*
Steerforth
said
,
as
we
drove
through
its
dark
streets
to
the
inn
,
that
,
*NL*
as
well
as
he
could
make
out
,
it
was
a
good
,
queer
,
out-of-the-way
kind
*NL*
of
hole
,
I
was
highly
pleased
.
We
went
to
bed
on
our
arrival
-LRB-
I
observed
*NL*
a
pair
of
dirty
shoes
and
gaiters
in
connexion
with
my
old
friend
the
*NL*
Dolphin
as
we
passed
that
door
-RRB-
,
and
breakfasted
late
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Steerforth
,
who
was
in
great
spirits
,
had
been
strolling
about
the
beach
*NL*
before
I
was
up
,
and
had
made
acquaintance
,
he
said
,
with
half
the
*NL*
boatmen
in
the
place
.
Moreover
he
had
seen
,
in
the
distance
,
what
he
was
*NL*
sure
must
be
the
identical
house
of
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
smoke
coming
out
*NL*
of
the
chimney
;
and
had
had
a
great
mind
,
he
told
me
,
to
walk
in
and
*NL*
swear
he
was
myself
grown
out
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
propose
to
introduce
me
there
,
Daisy
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
at
*NL*
your
disposal
.
Make
your
own
arrangements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
was
thinking
that
this
evening
would
be
a
good
time
,
Steerforth
,
*NL*
when
they
are
all
sitting
round
the
fire
.
I
should
like
you
to
see
it
*NL*
when
it
's
snug
,
it
's
such
a
curious
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
!
''
returned
Steerforth
.
``
This
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
give
them
any
notice
that
we
are
here
,
you
know
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
delighted
.
``
We
must
take
them
by
surprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
!
It
's
no
fun
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
unless
we
take
them
by
*NL*
surprise
.
Let
us
see
the
natives
in
their
aboriginal
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
they
_
are
_
that
sort
of
people
that
you
mentioned
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
What
!
you
recollect
my
skirmishes
with
Rosa
,
do
you
?
''
he
exclaimed
*NL*
with
a
quick
look
.
``
Confound
the
girl
,
I
am
half
afraid
of
her
.
She
's
*NL*
like
a
goblin
to
me
.
But
never
mind
her
.
Now
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
*NL*
You
are
going
to
see
your
nurse
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
must
see
Peggotty
first
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Steerforth
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
Suppose
I
deliver
you
*NL*
up
to
be
cried
over
for
a
couple
of
hours
.
Is
that
long
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
laughing
,
that
I
thought
we
might
get
through
it
in
that
*NL*
time
,
but
that
he
must
come
also
;
for
he
would
find
that
his
renown
had
*NL*
preceded
him
,
and
that
he
was
almost
as
great
a
personage
as
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
anywhere
you
like
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
or
do
anything
you
*NL*
like
.
Tell
me
where
to
come
to
;
and
in
two
hours
I
'll
produce
myself
in
*NL*
any
state
you
please
,
sentimental
or
comical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
minute
directions
for
finding
the
residence
of
Mr.
Barkis
,
*NL*
carrier
to
Blunderstone
and
elsewhere
,
and
,
on
this
understanding
,
went
*NL*
out
alone
.
There
was
a
sharp
bracing
air
;
the
ground
was
dry
;
the
sea
*NL*
was
crisp
and
clear
;
the
sun
was
diffusing
abundance
of
light
,
if
not
*NL*
much
warmth
;
and
everything
was
fresh
and
lively
.
I
was
so
fresh
and
*NL*
lively
myself
,
in
the
pleasure
of
being
there
,
that
I
could
have
stopped
*NL*
the
people
in
the
streets
and
shaken
hands
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
streets
looked
small
,
of
course
.
The
streets
that
we
have
only
seen
*NL*
as
children
,
always
do
,
I
believe
,
when
we
go
back
to
them
.
But
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
nothing
in
them
,
and
found
nothing
changed
,
until
I
came
to
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
's
shop
.
OMER
AND
JORAM
was
now
written
up
,
where
OMER
used
to
*NL*
be
;
but
the
inscription
,
DRAPER
,
TAILOR
,
HABERDASHER
,
FUNERAL
FURNISHER
,
*NL*
&
C.
,
remained
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
footsteps
seemed
to
tend
so
naturally
to
the
shop-door
,
after
I
had
*NL*
read
these
words
from
over
the
way
,
that
I
went
across
the
road
and
*NL*
looked
in
.
There
was
a
pretty
woman
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
dancing
a
*NL*
little
child
in
her
arms
,
while
another
little
fellow
clung
to
her
*NL*
apron
.
I
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
either
Minnie
or
Minnie
's
*NL*
children
.
The
glass-door
of
the
parlor
was
not
open
;
but
in
the
workshop
*NL*
across
the
yard
I
could
faintly
hear
the
old
tune
playing
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
never
left
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Omer
at
home
?
''
said
I
,
entering
.
``
I
should
like
to
see
him
,
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
if
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
sir
,
he
is
at
home
,
''
said
Minnie
;
``
this
weather
do
n't
suit
his
*NL*
asthma
out
of
doors
.
Joe
,
call
your
grandfather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fellow
,
who
was
holding
her
apron
,
gave
such
a
lusty
shout
,
*NL*
that
the
sound
of
it
made
him
bashful
,
and
he
buried
his
face
in
her
*NL*
skirts
,
to
her
great
admiration
.
I
heard
a
heavy
puffing
and
blowing
*NL*
coming
towards
us
,
and
soon
Mr.
Omer
,
shorter-winded
than
of
yore
,
but
*NL*
not
much
older-looking
,
stood
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Servant
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
shake
hands
with
me
,
Mr.
Omer
,
if
you
please
,
''
said
I
,
putting
*NL*
out
my
own
.
``
You
were
very
good-natured
to
me
once
,
when
I
am
afraid
I
*NL*
did
n't
show
that
I
thought
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
though
?
''
returned
the
old
man
.
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
when
.
Are
you
sure
it
was
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
my
memory
has
got
as
short
as
my
breath
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
*NL*
looking
at
me
and
shaking
his
head
;
``
for
I
do
n't
remember
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
remember
your
coming
to
the
coach
to
meet
me
,
and
my
having
*NL*
breakfast
here
,
and
our
riding
out
to
Blunderstone
together
:
you
,
and
I
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Joram
,
and
Mr.
Joram
too
--
who
was
n't
her
husband
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Omer
,
after
being
thrown
by
his
*NL*
surprise
into
a
fit
of
coughing
,
``
you
do
n't
say
so
!
Minnie
,
my
dear
,
you
*NL*
recollect
?
Dear
me
,
yes
--
the
party
was
a
lady
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
,
''
I
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
--
be
--
sure
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
touching
my
waistcoat
with
his
*NL*
forefinger
,
``
and
there
was
a
little
child
too
!
There
was
two
parties
.
*NL*
The
little
party
was
laid
along
with
the
other
party
.
Over
at
*NL*
Blunderstone
it
was
,
of
course
.
Dear
me
!
And
how
have
you
been
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Very
well
,
I
thanked
him
,
as
I
hoped
he
had
been
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
nothing
to
grumble
at
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
I
find
my
breath
*NL*
gets
short
,
but
it
seldom
gets
longer
as
a
man
gets
older

I
take
it
as
*NL*
it
comes
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
.
That
's
the
best
way
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
coughed
again
,
in
consequence
of
laughing
,
and
was
assisted
out
*NL*
of
his
fit
by
his
daughter
,
who
now
stood
close
beside
us
,
dancing
her
*NL*
smallest
child
on
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Yes

to
be
sure

Two

Why

in
that

very
ride
,
if
you
'll
believe
me

the
day
was
named
for
my
Minnie

Minnie
.
And
now

come
into
the
business

And
look
here

The
*NL*
youngest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
laughed
,
and
stroked
her
banded
hair
upon
her
temples
,
as
her
*NL*
father
put
one
of
his
fat
fingers
into
the
hand
of
the
child
she
was
*NL*
dancing
on
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
parties
,
of
course
!

said
Mr.
Omer
,
nodding
his
head
*NL*
retrospectively
.
``
Ex-actly
so
!
And
Joram
's
at
work
,
at
this
minute
,
on
a
*NL*
grey
one

silver
nails
,
not
this
measurement
''
--
the
measurement
of
*NL*
the
dancing
child
upon
the
counter
--
``
by
a
good
two
inches
.
--
Will
you
*NL*
take
something
?

*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
,
but
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,

said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Barkis

the
carrier

She
was
*NL*
in
service
there

*NL*
*NL*
My
answering
in
the
affirmative
gave
him
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
my
breath

get
long

much

said
Mr.

Well

that
has

elegant
a
taste

business

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

I
,
involuntarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Em

her
name

''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
``
and
she
's
little
too

But
if
you
'll
*NL*
believe
me
,
she
has
such
a
face
of
her
own
that
half
the
women
in
this
*NL*
town
are
mad
against
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

cried
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

,
``
I
do
n't

winking
*NL*
at
me
,
``
but
I
say
that
half
the
women
in
Yarmouth

ah

and
in
five
mile
*NL*
round

are
mad
against
that
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
should
have
kept
to
her
own
station
in
life

said
*NL*
Minnie
,
``
and
not
have
given

*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
have
done
it

retorted
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Could

done
*NL*
it

Is
that
_
your
_
knowledge
of
life
?
What
is
there
that
any
woman
*NL*
could
n't
do
,
that
she
should
n't
do
--
especially
on
the
subject
of
another
*NL*
woman
's
good
looks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
thought
it
was
all
over
with
Mr.
Omer
,
after
he
had
uttered
*NL*
this
libellous
pleasantry
.
He
coughed
to
that
extent
,
and
his
breath
*NL*
eluded
all
his
attempts
to
recover
it
with
that
obstinacy
,
that
I
fully
*NL*
expected
to
see
his
head
go
down
behind
the
counter
,
and
his
little
*NL*
black
breeches
,
with
the
rusty
little
bunches
of
ribbons
at
the
knees
,
*NL*
come
quivering
up
in
a
last
ineffectual
struggle
.
At
length
,
however
,
he
*NL*
got
better
,
though
he
still
panted
hard
,
and
was
so
exhausted
that
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
sit
on
the
stool
of
the
shop-desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
wiping
his
head
,
and
breathing
with
difficulty
,
``
she
*NL*
has
n't
taken
much
to
any
companions
here
;
she
has
n't
taken
kindly
to
any
*NL*
particular
acquaintances
and
friends
,
not
to
mention
sweethearts
.
In
*NL*
consequence
,
an
ill-natured
story
got
about
,
that
Em
`
ly
wanted
to
be
a
*NL*
lady
.
Now
my
opinion
is
,
that
it
came
into
circulation
principally
on
*NL*
account
of
her
sometimes
saying
,
at
the
school
,
that
if
she
was
a
lady
*NL*
she
would
like
to
do
so
and
so
for
her
uncle
--
do
n't
you
see
?
--
and
buy
*NL*
him
such
and
such
fine
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Omer
,
she
has
said
so
to
me
,
''
I
returned
eagerly
,
*NL*
``
when
we
were
both
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
nodded
his
head
and
rubbed
his
chin
.
``
Just
so
.
Then
out
of
a
*NL*
very
little
,
she
could
dress
herself
,
you
see
,
better
than
most
others
*NL*
could
out
of
a
deal
,
and
_
that
_
made
things
unpleasant
.
Moreover
,
she
*NL*
was
rather
what
might
be
called
wayward
--
I
'll
go
so
far
as
to
say
what
I
*NL*
should
call
wayward
myself
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
''
--
did
n't
know
her
own
mind
*NL*
quite
--
a
little
spoiled
--
and
could
n't
,
at
first
,
exactly
bind
herself
*NL*
down
.
No
more
than
that
was
ever
said
against
her
,
Minnie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
father
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joram
.
``
That
's
the
worst
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
when
she
got
a
situation
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
``
to
keep
a
fractious
old
*NL*
lady
company
,
they
did
n't
very
well
agree
,
and
she
did
n't
stop
.
At
last
*NL*
she
came
here
,
apprenticed
for
three
years
.
Nearly
two
of
'em
are
over
,
*NL*
and
she
has
been
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
was
.
Worth
any
six

Minnie
,
is
*NL*
she
worth
any
six
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
,
''
replied
Minnie
.
``
Never
say
_
I
_
detracted
from
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
That
's
right
.
And
so
,
young
gentleman
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
after
a
few
moments
'
further
rubbing
of
his
chin
,
``
that
you
may
*NL*
not
consider
me
long-winded
as
well
as
short-breathed
,
I
believe
that
's
*NL*
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
had
spoken
in
a
subdued
tone
,
while
speaking
of
Em
`
ly
,
I
had
no
*NL*
doubt
that
she
was
near
.
On
my
asking
now
,
if
that
were
not
so
,
Mr.
Omer
*NL*
nodded
yes
,
and
nodded
towards
the
door
of
the
parlor
.
My
hurried
*NL*
inquiry
if
I
might
peep
in
,
was
answered
with
a
free
permission
;
and
,
*NL*
looking
through
the
glass
,
I
saw
her
sitting
at
her
work
.
I
saw
her
,
a
*NL*
most
beautiful
little
creature
,
with
the
cloudless
blue
eyes
,
that
had
*NL*
looked
into
my
childish
heart
,
turned
laughingly
upon
another
child
of
*NL*
Minnie
's
who
was
playing
near
her
;
with
enough
of
wilfulness
in
her
*NL*
bright
face
to
justify
what
I
had
heard
;
with
much
of
the
old
capricious
*NL*
coyness
lurking
in
it
;
but
with
nothing
in
her
pretty
looks
,
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
but
what
was
meant
for
goodness
and
for
happiness
,
and
what
was
on
a
*NL*
good
and
happy
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tune
across
the
yard
that
seemed
as
if
it
never
had
left
off
--
alas
!
*NL*
it
was
the
tune
that
never
_
does
_
leave
off
--
was
beating
,
softly
,
all
*NL*
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
you
like
to
step
in
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
``
and
speak
to
her
?
Walk
*NL*
in
and
speak
to
her
,
sir
!
Make
yourself
at
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
too
bashful
to
do
so
then
--
I
was
afraid
of
confusing
her
,
and
I
*NL*
was
no
less
afraid
of
confusing
myself
:
but
I
informed
myself
of
the
*NL*
hour
at
which
she
left
of
an
evening
,
in
order
that
our
visit
might
be
*NL*
timed
accordingly
;
and
taking
leave
of
Mr.
Omer
,
and
his
pretty
*NL*
daughter
,
and
her
little
children
,
went
away
to
my
dear
old
Peggotty
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
was
,
in
the
tiled
kitchen
,
cooking
dinner
!
The
moment
I
knocked
*NL*
at
the
door
she
opened
it
,
and
asked
me
what
I
pleased
to
want
.
I
looked
*NL*
at
her
with
a
smile
,
but
she
gave
me
no
smile
in
return
.
I
had
never
*NL*
ceased
to
write
to
her
,
but
it
must
have
been
seven
years
since
we
had
*NL*
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Barkis
at
home
,
ma'am
?
''
I
said
,
feigning
to
speak
roughly
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
at
home
,
sir
,
''
returned
Peggotty
,
``
but
he
's
bad
abed
with
the
*NL*
rheumatics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
he
go
over
to
Blunderstone
now
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
's
well
,
he
do
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
_
you
_
ever
go
there
,
Mrs.
Barkis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
more
attentively
,
and
I
noticed
a
quick
movement
of
her
*NL*
hands
towards
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
want
to
ask
a
question
about
a
house
there
,
that
they
call
*NL*
the
--
what
is
it
?
--
the
Rookery
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
step
backward
,
and
put
out
her
hands
in
an
undecided
*NL*
frightened
way
,
as
if
to
keep
me
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peggotty
!
''
I
cried
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
,
``
My
darling
boy
!
''
and
we
both
burst
into
tears
,
and
were
*NL*
locked
in
one
another
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
extravagancies
she
committed
;
what
laughing
and
crying
over
me
;
*NL*
what
pride
she
showed
,
what
joy
,
what
sorrow
that
she
whose
pride
and
*NL*
joy
I
might
have
been
,
could
never
hold
me
in
a
fond
embrace
;
I
have
not
*NL*
the
heart
to
tell
.
I
was
troubled
with
no
misgiving
that
it
was
young
in
*NL*
me
to
respond
to
her
emotions
.
I
had
never
laughed
and
cried
in
all
my
*NL*
life
,
I
dare
say
--
not
even
to
her
--
more
freely
than
I
did
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barkis
will
be
so
glad
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
,
*NL*
``
that
it
'll
do
him
more
good
than
pints
of
liniment
.
May
I
go
and
tell
*NL*
him
you
are
here
?
Will
you
come
up
and
see
him
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
would
.
But
Peggotty
could
not
get
out
of
the
room
as
easily
*NL*
as
she
meant
to
,
for
as
often
as
she
got
to
the
door
and
looked
round
at
*NL*
me
,
she
came
back
again
to
have
another
laugh
and
another
cry
upon
my
*NL*
shoulder
.
At
last
,
to
make
the
matter
easier
,
I
went
up-stairs
with
her
;
*NL*
and
having
waited
outside
for
a
minute
,
while
she
said
a
word
of
*NL*
preparation
to
Mr.
Barkis
,
presented
myself
before
that
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
me
with
absolute
enthusiasm
.
He
was
too
rheumatic
to
be
*NL*
shaken
hands
with
,
but
he
begged
me
to
shake
the
tassel
on
the
top
of
*NL*
his
nightcap
,
which
I
did
most
cordially
.
When
I
sat
down
by
the
side
of
*NL*
the
bed
,
he
said
that
it
did
him
a
world
of
good
to
feel
as
if
he
was
*NL*
driving
me
on
the
Blunderstone
road
again
.
As
he
lay
in
bed
,
face
*NL*
upward
,
and
so
covered
,
with
that
exception
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
nothing
but
a
face
--
like
a
conventional
cherubim
,
--
he
looked
the
*NL*
queerest
object
I
ever
beheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
was
it
,
as
I
wrote
up
,
in
the
cart
,
sir
?
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
*NL*
with
a
slow
rheumatic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mr.
Barkis
,
we
had
some
grave
talks
about
that
matter
,
had
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
willin
'
a
long
time
,
sir
?
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
long
time
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
n't
regret
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
``
Do
you
remember
what
you
told
*NL*
me
once
,
about
her
making
all
the
apple
parsties
and
doing
all
the
*NL*
cooking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
well
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
as
true
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
``
as
turnips
is
.
It
was
as
true
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
,
nodding
his
nightcap
,
which
was
his
only
means
of
emphasis
,
*NL*
``
as
taxes
is
.
And
nothing
's
truer
than
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
,
as
if
for
my
assent
to
this
result
*NL*
of
his
reflections
in
bed
;
and
I
gave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
's
truer
than
them
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Barkis
;
``
a
man
as
poor
as
I
am
*NL*
finds
that
out
in
his
mind
when
he
's
laid
up
.
I
'm
a
very
poor
man
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
Mr.
Barkis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
poor
man
,
indeed
I
am
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
his
right
hand
came
slowly
and
feebly
from
under
the
bedclothes
,
*NL*
and
with
a
purposeless
uncertain
grasp
took
hold
of
a
stick
which
was
*NL*
loosely
tied
to
the
side
of
the
bed
.
After
some
poking
about
with
this
*NL*
instrument
,
in
the
course
of
which
his
face
assumed
a
variety
of
*NL*
distracted
expressions
,
Mr.
Barkis
poked
it
against
a
box
,
an
end
of
*NL*
which
had
been
visible
to
me
all
the
time
.
Then
his
face
became
*NL*
composed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
clothes
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
was
Money
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
was
,
indeed
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
AI
N'T
,
''
said
Mr.
Barkis
,
opening
both
his
eyes
as
wide
as
he
*NL*
possibly
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
myself
quite
sure
of
that
,
and
Mr.
Barkis
,
turning
his
eyes
*NL*
more
gently
to
his
wife
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
the
usefullest
and
best
of
women
,
C.
P.
Barkis
.
All
the
praise
*NL*
that
any
one
can
give
to
C.
P.
Barkis
,
she
deserves
,
and
more
!
My
dear
,
*NL*
you
'll
get
a
dinner
to-day
,
for
company
;
something
good
to
eat
and
*NL*
drink
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
protested
against
this
unnecessary
demonstration
in
my
*NL*
honor
,
but
that
I
saw
Peggotty
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
,
*NL*
extremely
anxious
I
should
not
.
So
I
held
my
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
got
a
trifle
of
money
somewhere
about
me
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Barkis
,
``
but
I
'm
a
little
tired
.
If
you
and
Mr.
David
will
leave
me
for
*NL*
a
short
nap
,
I
'll
try
and
find
it
when
I
wake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
the
room
,
in
compliance
with
this
request
.
When
we
got
outside
*NL*
the
door
,
Peggotty
informed
me
that
Mr.
Barkis
,
being
now
``
a
little
*NL*
nearer
''
than
he
used
to
be
,
always
resorted
to
this
same
device
before
*NL*
producing
a
single
coin
from
his
store
;
and
that
he
endured
unheard-of
*NL*
agonies
in
crawling
out
of
bed
alone
,
and
taking
it
from
that
unlucky
*NL*
box
.
In
effect
,
we
presently
heard
him
uttering
suppressed
groans
of
the
*NL*
most
dismal
nature
,
as
this
magpie
proceeding
racked
him
in
every
joint
;
*NL*
but
while
Peggotty
's
eyes
were
full
of
compassion
for
him
,
she
said
his
*NL*
generous
impulse
would
do
him
good
,
and
it
was
better
not
to
check
it
.
*NL*
So
he
groaned
on
,
until
he
had
got
into
bed
again
,
suffering
,
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
,
a
martyrdom
;
and
then
called
us
in
,
pretending
to
have
just
woke
*NL*
up
from
a
refreshing
sleep
,
and
to
produce
a
guinea
from
under
his
*NL*
pillow
.
His
satisfaction
in
which
happy
imposition
on
us
,
and
in
having
*NL*
preserved
the
impenetrable
secret
of
the
box
,
appeared
to
be
a
*NL*
sufficient
compensation
to
him
for
all
his
tortures
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
prepared
Peggotty
for
Steerforth
's
arrival
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
*NL*
he
came
.
I
am
persuaded
she
knew
no
difference
between
his
having
been
a
*NL*
personal
benefactor
of
hers
,
and
a
kind
friend
to
me
,
and
that
she
would
*NL*
have
received
him
with
the
utmost
gratitude
and
devotion
in
any
case
.
*NL*
But
his
easy
,
spirited
,
good
humour
;
his
genial
manner
,
his
handsome
*NL*
looks
,
his
natural
gift
of
adapting
himself
to
whomsoever
he
pleased
,
*NL*
and
making
direct
,
when
he
cared
to
do
it
,
to
the
main
point
of
interest
*NL*
in
anybody
's
heart
;
bound
her
to
him
wholly
in
five
minutes
.
His
manner
*NL*
to
me
,
alone
,
would
have
won
her
.
But
,
through
all
these
causes
*NL*
combined
,
I
sincerely
believe
she
had
a
kind
of
adoration
for
him
before
*NL*
he
left
the
house
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stayed
there
with
me
to
dinner
--
if
I
were
to
say
willingly
,
I
should
*NL*
not
half
express
how
readily
and
gaily
.
He
went
into
Mr.
Barkis
's
room
*NL*
like
light
and
air
,
brightening
and
refreshing
it
as
if
he
were
healthy
*NL*
weather
.
There
was
no
noise
,
no
effort
,
no
consciousness
,
in
anything
he
*NL*
did
;
but
in
everything
an
indescribable
lightness
,
a
seeming
*NL*
impossibility
of
doing
anything
else
,
or
doing
anything
better
,
which
*NL*
was
so
graceful
,
so
natural
,
and
agreeable
,
that
it
overcomes
me
,
even
*NL*
now
,
in
the
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
merry
in
the
little
parlor
,
where
the
Book
of
Martyrs
,
unthumbed
*NL*
since
my
time
,
was
laid
out
upon
the
desk
as
of
old
,
and
where
I
now
*NL*
turned
over
its
terrific
pictures
,
remembering
the
old
sensations
they
*NL*
had
awakened
,
but
not
feeling
them
.
When
Peggotty
spoke
of
what
she
*NL*
called
my
room
,
and
of
its
being
ready
for
me
at
night
,
and
of
her
*NL*
hoping
I
would
occupy
it
,
before
I
could
so
much
as
look
at
Steerforth
,
*NL*
hesitating
,
he
was
possessed
of
the
whole
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
'll
sleep
here
,
while
we
stay
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
sleep
at
the
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
to
bring
you
so
far
,
''
I
returned
,
``
and
to
separate
,
seems
bad
*NL*
companionship
,
Steerforth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
where
do
you
naturally
belong
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
What
is
`
seems
,
'
compared
to
that
!
''
It
was
settled
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
maintained
all
his
delightful
qualities
to
the
last
,
until
we
started
*NL*
forth
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
for
Mr.
Peggotty
's
boat
.
Indeed
,
they
were
more
*NL*
and
more
brightly
exhibited
as
the
hours
went
on
;
for
I
thought
even
*NL*
then
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
now
,
that
the
consciousness
of
success
in
his
*NL*
determination
to
please
,
inspired
him
with
a
new
delicacy
of
perception
,
*NL*
and
made
it
,
subtle
as
it
was
,
more
easy
to
him
.
If
any
one
had
told
me
,
*NL*
then
,
that
all
this
was
a
brilliant
game
,
played
for
the
excitement
of
*NL*
the
moment
,
for
the
employment
of
high
spirits
,
in
the
thoughtless
love
*NL*
of
superiority
,
in
a
mere
wasteful
careless
course
of
winning
what
was
*NL*
worthless
to
him
,
and
next
minute
thrown
away
--
I
say
,
if
any
one
had
*NL*
told
me
such
a
lie
that
night
,
I
wonder
in
what
manner
of
receiving
it
*NL*
my
indignation
would
have
found
a
vent
!
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
only
in
an
increase
,
had
that
been
possible
,
of
the
romantic
*NL*
feelings
of
fidelity
and
friendship
with
which
I
walked
beside
him
,
over
*NL*
the
dark
wintry
sands
,
towards
the
old
boat
;
the
wind
sighing
around
us
*NL*
even
more
mournfully
,
than
it
had
sighed
and
moaned
upon
the
night
when
*NL*
I
first
darkened
Mr.
Peggotty
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
wild
kind
of
place
,
Steerforth
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dismal
enough
in
the
dark
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
the
sea
roars
as
if
it
were
*NL*
hungry
for
us
.
Is
that
the
boat
,
where
I
see
a
light
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
boat
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
the
same
I
saw
this
morning
,
''
he
returned
.
``
I
came
straight
to
*NL*
it
,
by
instinct
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
no
more
as
we
approached
the
light
,
but
made
softly
for
the
*NL*
door
.
I
laid
my
hand
upon
the
latch
;
and
whispering
Steerforth
to
keep
*NL*
close
to
me
,
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
of
voices
had
been
audible
on
the
outside
,
and
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
of
our
entrance
,
a
clapping
of
hands
:
which
latter
noise
,
I
was
*NL*
surprised
to
see
,
proceeded
from
the
generally
disconsolate
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
.
But
Mrs.
Gummidge
was
not
the
only
person
there
,
who
was
*NL*
unusually
excited
.
Mr.
Peggotty
,
his
face
lighted
up
with
uncommon
*NL*
satisfaction
,
and
laughing
with
all
his
might
,
held
his
rough
arms
wide
*NL*
open
,
as
if
for
little
Em
`
ly
to
run
into
them
;
Ham
,
with
a
mixed
*NL*
expression
in
his
face
of
admiration
,
exultation
,
and
a
lumbering
sort
*NL*
of
bashfulness
that
sat
upon
him
very
well
,
held
little
Em
`

by
the
*NL*
hand
,
as
if
he
were
presenting
her
to
Mr.
Peggotty
;
little
Em
`
ly
*NL*
herself
,
blushing
and
shy
,
but
delighted
with
Mr.
Peggotty
's
delight
,
as
*NL*
her
joyous
eyes
expressed
,
was
stopped
by
our
entrance
-LRB-
for
she
saw
us
*NL*
first
-RRB-
in
the
very
act
of
springing
from
Ham
to
nestle
in
Mr.
Peggotty
's
*NL*
embrace
.
In
the
first
glimpse
we
had
of
them
all
,
and
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
our
passing
from
the
dark
cold
night
into
the
warm
light
room
,
this
was
*NL*
the
way
in
which
they
were
all
employed
:
Mrs.
Gummidge
in
the
back
*NL*
ground
,
clapping
her
hands
like
a
madwoman
.

We
arrive
unexpectedly
at
Mr.
Peggotty
's
fireside

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
picture
was
so
instantaneously
dissolved
by
our
going
in
,
*NL*
that
one
might
have
doubted
whether
it
had
ever
been
.
I
was
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
astonished
family
,
face
to
face
with
Mr.
Peggotty
,
and
holding
*NL*
out
my
hand
to
him
,
when
Ham
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
It
's
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
we
were
all
shaking
hands
with
one
another
,
and
asking
one
*NL*
another
how
we
did
,
and
telling
one
another
how
glad
we
were
to
meet
,
*NL*
and
all
talking
at
once
.
Mr.
Peggotty
was
so
proud
and
overjoyed
to
see
*NL*
us
,
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
,
but
kept
over
and
over
again
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
me
,
and
then
with
Steerforth
,
and
then
with
me
,
and
*NL*
then
ruffling
his
shaggy
hair
all
over
his
head
,
and
laughing
with
such
*NL*
glee
and
triumph
,
that
it
was
a
treat
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
you
two
gent
`
lmen
--

`

growed
--
should
come
to
this

*NL*
roof
to-night
,
of
all
nights
in
my
life

''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
is
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
never
happened
afore

do
rightly
believe

*NL*
*NL*
After
delivering
this
speech
all
in
a
breath
,
and
with
extraordinary
*NL*
animation
and
pleasure
,
Mr.
Peggotty
put
one
of
his
large
hands
*NL*
rapturously
on
each
side
of
his
niece
's
face
,
and
kissing
it
a
dozen
*NL*
times
,
laid
it
with
a
gentle
pride
and
love
upon
his
broad
chest
,
and
*NL*
patted
it
as
if
his
hand
had
been
a
lady
's
.
Then
he
let
her
go
;
and
as
*NL*
she
ran
into
the
little
chamber
where
I
used
to
sleep
,
looked
round
upon
*NL*
us
,
quite
hot
and
out
of
breath
with
his
uncommon
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

out
again

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

nodded
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
ai

said
Mr.

,
sitting
down
among
us
by
the
fire
,
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
only
nodded
;

with
such
a
pleased
expression
of
interest
,
*NL*
and
of
participation
in
Mr.
Peggotty
's
feelings
,
that
the

*NL*
answered
him
as

he
had
spoken

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

nodded
to
me
several
times

if
he
would
have
said
so
too

*NL*
Mr.

ruffled
his
hair
again
with
both
hands

as
a
further
*NL*
preparation
for
what
he
was
going
to
say

went
on
with
a

upon

each
of

,
on

a

chap

with
his
art
in
the
right
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
Ham
grin
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
*NL*
he
sat
grinning
at
us
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
here
blessed
tarpaulin
go

do

said
Mr.

,
*NL*
with
his
face
one
high
noon
of
enjoyment
,
``

he
loses
that
there
art

follers

he
makes
hisself

he
loses
in
a
great
measure
his
relish
for
his

wittles
,

in
the
long
run
he
makes
it
clear
to
me
wot
's
amiss

Now
I
*NL*
could
wish
myself

you
see

Mr.

in
simple
earnestness

waved
his
right
arm

as
if
he
were
*NL*
waving
it
at
the
town-lights
for
the
last
time
,
and
then
,
exchanging
a
*NL*
nod
with
Ham
,
whose
eye
he
caught

proceeded
as
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

him

And
he
was

honorable

manful

for

now
resumed
all
its

triumphant
delight

*NL*

he
laid
a

a

wetting
them
both

the

his

under
the

Mr.

dealt
him
*NL*
in
his
unbounded
joy
,
as
a
mark
of
confidence

friendship
;
but
*NL*
feeling
called
upon
to
say
something
to
us

he
said
,
with
much
faltering
*NL*
and
great
difficulty
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She

thought
it
affecting

trembling

what
he
felt
for
the
pretty
little
creature
*NL*
who
had
won
his
heart
.
I
thought
the
simple
confidence
reposed
in
us
by
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
and
by
himself
,
was
,
in
itself
,
affecting
.
I
was
affected
*NL*
by
the
story
altogether
.
How
far
my
emotions
were
influenced
by
the
*NL*
recollections
of
my
childhood
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Whether
I
had
come
there
*NL*
with
any
lingering
fancy
that
I
was
still
to
love
little
Em
`
ly
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
I
know
that
I
was
filled
with
pleasure
by
all
this
;
but
,
at
first
,
*NL*
with
an
indescribably
sensitive
pleasure
,
that
a
very
little
would
have
*NL*
changed
to
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
if
it
had
depended
upon
me
to
touch
the
prevailing
chord
*NL*
among
them
with
any
skill
,
I
should
have
made
a
poor
hand
of
it
.
But
it
*NL*
depended
upon
Steerforth
;
and
he
did
it
with
such
address
,
that
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
we
were
all
as
easy
and
as
happy
as
it
was
possible
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Peggotty
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
are
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
,
and
deserve
*NL*
to
be
as
happy
as
you
are
to-night
.
My
hand
upon
it
!
Ham
,
I
give
you
*NL*
joy
,
my
boy
.
My
hand
upon
that
,
too
!
Daisy
,
stir
the
fire
,
and
make
it
a
*NL*
brisk
one
!
and
Mr.
Peggotty
,
unless
you
can
induce
your
gentle
niece
to
*NL*
come
back
-LRB-
for
whom
I
vacate
this
seat
in
the
corner
-RRB-
,
I
shall
go
.
Any
*NL*
gap
at
your
fireside
on
such
a
night
--
such
a
gap
least
of
all
--
I
*NL*
would
n't
make
,
for
the
wealth
of
the
Indies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mr.
Peggotty
went
into
my
old
room
to
fetch
little
Em
`
ly
.
At
first
*NL*
little
Em
`
ly
did
n't
like
to
come
,
and
then
Ham
went
.
Presently
they
*NL*
brought
her
to
the
fireside
,
very
much
confused
,
and
very
shy
,
--
but
she
*NL*
soon
became
more
assured
when
she
found
how
gently
and
respectfully
*NL*
Steerforth
spoke
to
her
;
how
skilfully
he
avoided
anything
that
would
*NL*
embarrass
her
;
how
he
talked
to
Mr.
Peggotty
of
boats
,
and
ships
,
and
*NL*
tides
,
and
fish
;
how
he
referred
to
me
about
the
time
when
he
had
seen
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
at
Salem
House
;
how
delighted
he
was
with
the
boat
and
all
*NL*
belonging
to
it
;
how
lightly
and
easily
he
carried
on
,
until
he
brought
*NL*
us
,
by
degrees
,
into
a
charmed
circle
,
and
we
were
all
talking
away
*NL*
without
any
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Em
`
ly
,
indeed
,
said
little
all
the
evening
;
but
she
looked
,
and
*NL*
listened
,
and
her
face
got
animated
,
and
she
was
charming
.
Steerforth
*NL*
told
a
story
of
a
dismal
shipwreck
-LRB-
which
arose
out
of
his
talk
with
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
-RRB-
,
as
if
he
saw
it
all
before
him
--
and
little
Em
`
ly
's
eyes
were
*NL*
fastened
on
him
all
the
time
,
as
if
she
saw
it
too
.
He
told
us
a
merry
*NL*
adventure
of
his
own
,
as
a
relief
to
that
,
with
as
much
gaiety
as
if
the
*NL*
narrative
were
as
fresh
to
him
as
it
was
to
us
--
and
little
Em
`
ly
laughed
*NL*
until
the
boat
rang
with
the
musical
sounds
,
and
we
all
laughed
*NL*
-LRB-
Steerforth
too
-RRB-
,
in
irresistible
sympathy
with
what
was
so
pleasant
and
*NL*
light-hearted
.
He
got
Mr.
Peggotty
to
sing
,
or
rather
to
roar
,
``
When
the
*NL*
stormy
winds
do
blow
,
do
blow
,
do
blow
;
''
and
he
sang
a
sailor
's
song
*NL*
himself
,
so
pathetically
and
beautifully
,
that
I
could
have
almost
*NL*
fancied
that
the
real
wind
creeping
sorrowfully
round
the
house
,
and
*NL*
murmuring
low
through
our
unbroken
silence
,
was
there
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
he
roused
that
victim
of
despondency
with
a
success
*NL*
never
attained
by
any
one
else
-LRB-
so
Mr.
Peggotty
informed
me
-RRB-
since
the
*NL*
decease
of
the
old
one
.
He
left
her
so
little
leisure
for
being
*NL*
miserable
that
she
said
next
day
she
thought
she
must
have
been
*NL*
bewitched
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
set
up
no
monopoly
of
the
general
attention
,
or
the
conversation
.
*NL*
When
little
Em
`
ly
grew
more
courageous
,
and
talked
-LRB-
but
still
bashfully
-RRB-
*NL*
across
the
fire
to
me
,
of
our
old
wanderings
upon
the
beach
,
to
pick
up
*NL*
shells
and
pebbles
;
and
when
I
asked
her
if
she
recollected
how
I
used
*NL*
to
be
devoted
to
her
;
and
when
we
both
laughed
and
reddened
,
casting
*NL*
these
looks
back
on
the
pleasant
old
times
,
so
unreal
to
look
at
now
;
he
*NL*
was
silent
and
attentive
,
and
observed
us
thoughtfully
.
She
sat
,
at
this
*NL*
time
,
and
all
the
evening
,
on
the
old
locker
in
her
old
little
corner
by
*NL*
the
fire
--
Ham
beside
her
,
where
I
used
to
sit
.
I
could
not
satisfy
*NL*
myself
whether
it
was
in
her
own
little
tormenting
way
,
or
in
a
maidenly
*NL*
reserve
before
us
,
that
she
kept
quite
close
to
the
wall
,
and
away
from
*NL*
him
;
but
I
observed
that
she
did
so
,
all
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
remember
,
it
was
almost
midnight
when
we
took
our
leave
.
We
had
had
*NL*
some
biscuit
and
dried
fish
for
supper
,
and
Steerforth
had
produced
from
*NL*
his
pocket
a
full
flask
of
Hollands
,
which
we
men
-LRB-
I
may
say
we
men
,
*NL*
now
,
without
a
blush
-RRB-
had
emptied
.
We
parted
merrily
;
and
as
they
all
*NL*
stood
crowded
round
the
door
to
light
us
as
far
as
they
could
upon
our
*NL*
road
,
I
saw
the
sweet
blue
eyes
of
little
Em
`
ly
peeping
after
us
,
from
*NL*
behind
Ham
,
and
heard
her
soft
voice
calling
to
us
to
be
careful
how
we
*NL*
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
engaging
little
Beauty
!
''
said
Steerforth
,
taking
my
arm
.
``
Well
!
*NL*
It
's
a
quaint
place
,
and
they
are
quaint
company
,
and
it
's
quite
a
new
*NL*
sensation
to
mix
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fortunate
we
are
,
too
,
''
I
returned
,
``
to
have
arrived
to
witness
*NL*
their
happiness
in
that
intended
marriage
!
I
never
saw
people
so
happy
.
*NL*
How
delightful
to
see
it
,
and
to
be
made
the
sharers
in
their
honest
*NL*
joy
,
as
we
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
rather
a
chuckle-headed
fellow
for
the
girl
;
is
n't
he
?
''
said
*NL*
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
so
hearty
with
him
,
and
with
them
all
,
that
I
felt
a
shock
*NL*
in
this
unexpected
and
cold
reply
.
But
turning
quickly
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
seeing
a
laugh
in
his
eyes
,
I
answered
,
much
relieved
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Steerforth
!
It
's
well
for
you
to
joke
about
the
poor
!
You
may
*NL*
skirmish
with
Miss
Dartle
,
or
try
to
hide
your
sympathies
in
jest
from
*NL*
me
,
but
I
know
better
.
When
I
see
how
perfectly
you
understand
them
,
how
*NL*
exquisitely
you
can
enter
into
happiness
like
this
plain
fisherman
's
,
or
*NL*
humour
a
love
like
my
old
nurse
's
,
I
know
that
there
is
not
a
joy
or
*NL*
sorrow
,
not
an
emotion
,
of
such
people
,
that
can
be
indifferent
to
you
.
*NL*
And
I
admire
and
love
you
for
it
,
Steerforth
,
twenty
times
the
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
,
and
,
looking
in
my
face
,
said
,
``
Daisy
,
I
believe
you
are
in
*NL*
earnest
,
and
are
good
.
I
wish
we
all
were
!
''
Next
moment
he
was
gaily
*NL*
singing
Mr.
Peggotty
's
song
,
as
we
walked
at
a
round
pace
back
to
*NL*
Yarmouth
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
SOME
OLD
SCENES
,
AND
SOME
NEW
PEOPLE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
and
I
stayed
for
more
than
a
fortnight
in
that
part
of
the
*NL*
country
.
We
were
very
much
together
,
I
need
not
say
;
but
occasionally
we
*NL*
were
asunder
for
some
hours
at
a
time
.
He
was
a
good
sailor
,
and
I
was
*NL*
but
an
indifferent
one
;
and
when
he
went
out
boating
with
Mr.
Peggotty
,
*NL*
which
was
a
favorite
amusement
of
his
,
I
generally
remained
ashore
.
My
*NL*
occupation
of
Peggotty
's
spare-room
put
a
constraint
upon
me
,
from
which
*NL*
he
was
free
:
for
,
knowing
how
assiduously
she
attended
on
Mr.
Barkis
all
*NL*
day
,
I
did
not
like
to
remain
out
late
at
night
;
whereas
Steerforth
,
*NL*
lying
at
the
Inn
,
had
nothing
to
consult
but
his
own
humour
.
Thus
it
*NL*
came
about
,
that
I
heard
of
his
making
little
treats
for
the
fishermen
*NL*
at
Mr.
Peggotty
's
house
of
call
,
``
The
Willing
Mind
,
''
after
I
was
in
bed
,
*NL*
and
of
his
being
afloat
,
wrapped
in
fisherman
's
clothes
,
whole
moonlight
*NL*
nights
,
and
coming
back
when
the
morning
tide
was
at
flood
.
By
this
*NL*
time
,
however
,
I
knew
that
his
restless
nature
and
bold
spirits
*NL*
delighted
to
find
a
vent
in
rough
toil
and
hard
weather
,
as
in
any
other
*NL*
means
of
excitement
that
presented
itself
freshly
to
him
;
so
none
of
his
*NL*
proceedings
surprised
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
cause
of
our
being
sometimes
apart
,
was
,
that
I
had
naturally
an
*NL*
interest
in
going
over
to
Blunderstone
,
and
revisiting
the
old
familiar
*NL*
scenes
of
my
childhood
;
while
Steerforth
,
after
being
there
once
,
had
*NL*
naturally
no
great
interest
in
going
there
again
.
Hence
,
on
three
or
*NL*
four
days
that
I
can
at
once
recal
,
we
went
our
several
ways
after
an
*NL*
early
breakfast
,
and
met
again
at
a
late
dinner
.
I
had
no
idea
how
he
*NL*
employed
his
time
in
the
interval
,
beyond
a
general
knowledge
that
he
*NL*
was
very
popular
in
the
place
,
and
had
twenty
means
of
actively
*NL*
diverting
himself
where
another
man
might
not
have
found
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
my
occupation
in
my
solitary
pilgrimages
was
to
recal
*NL*
every
yard
of
the
old
road
as
I
went
along
it
,
and
to
haunt
the
old
*NL*
spots
,
of
which
I
never
tired
.
I
haunted
them
,
as
my
memory
had
often
*NL*
done
,
and
lingered
among
them
as
my
younger
thoughts
had
lingered
when
I
*NL*
was
far
away
.
The
grave
beneath
the
tree
,
where
both
my
parents
lay
--
on
*NL*
which
I
had
looked
out
,
when
it
was
my
father
's
only
,
with
such
curious
*NL*
feelings
of
compassion
,
and
by
which
I
had
stood
,
so
desolate
,
when
it
*NL*
was
opened
to
receive
my
pretty
mother
and
her
baby
--
the
grave
which
*NL*
Peggotty
's
own
faithful
care
had
ever
since
kept
neat
,
and
made
a
garden
*NL*
of
,
I
walked
near
,
by
the
hour
.
It
lay
a
little
off
the
church-yard
*NL*
path
,
in
a
quiet
corner
,
not
so
far
removed
but
I
could
read
the
names
*NL*
upon
the
stone
as
I
walked
to
and
fro
,
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
church-bell
when
it
struck
the
hour
,
for
it
was
like
a
departed
voice
to
*NL*
me
.
My
reflections
at
these
times
were
always
associated
with
the
figure
*NL*
I
was
to
make
in
life
,
and
the
distinguished
things
I
was
to
do
.
My
*NL*
echoing
footsteps
went
to
no
other
tune
,
but
were
as
constant
to
that
as
*NL*
if
I
had
come
home
to
build
my
castles
in
the
air
at
a
living
mother
's
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
great
changes
in
my
old
home
.
The
ragged
nests
,
so
long
*NL*
deserted
by
the
rooks
,
were
gone
;
and
the
trees
were
lopped
and
topped
*NL*
out
of
their
remembered
shapes
.
The
garden
had
run
wild
,
and
half
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
house
were
shut
up
.
It
was
occupied
,
but
only
by
a
poor
*NL*
lunatic
gentleman
,
and
the
people
who
took
care
of
him
.
He
was
always
*NL*
sitting
at
my
little
window
,
looking
out
into
the
church-yard
;
and
I
*NL*
wondered
whether
his
rambling
thoughts
ever
went
upon
any
of
the
fancies
*NL*
that
used
to
occupy
mine
,
on
the
rosy
mornings
when
I
peeped
out
of
that
*NL*
same
little
window
in
my
night-clothes
,
and
saw
the
sheep
quietly
*NL*
feeding
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
old
neighbours
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grayper
,
were
gone
to
South
America
,
*NL*
and
the
rain
had
made
its
way
through
the
roof
of
their
empty
house
,
*NL*
and
stained
the
outer
walls
.
Mr.
Chillip
was
married
again
to
a
tall
,
*NL*
raw-boned
,
high-nosed
wife
;
and
they
had
a
weazen
little
baby
,
with
a
*NL*
heavy
head
that
it
could
n't
hold
up
,
and
two
weak
staring
eyes
,
with
*NL*
which
it
seemed
to
be
always
wondering
why
it
had
ever
been
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
singular
jumble
of
sadness
and
pleasure
that
I
used
to
*NL*
linger
about
my
native
place
,
until
the
reddening
winter
sun
admonished
*NL*
me
that
it
was
time
to
start
on
my
returning
walk
.
But
,
when
the
place
*NL*
was
left
behind
,
and
especially
when
Steerforth
and
I
were
happily
*NL*
seated
over
our
dinner
by
a
blazing
fire
,
it
was
delicious
to
think
*NL*
of
having
been
there
.
So
it
was
,
though
in
a
softened
degree
,
when
*NL*
I
went
to
my
neat
room
at
night
;
and
,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
*NL*
the
crocodile-book
-LRB-
which
was
always
there
,
upon
a
little
table
-RRB-
,
*NL*
remembered
with
a
grateful
heart
how
blest
I
was
in
having
such
a
*NL*
friend
as
Steerforth
,
such
a
friend
as
Peggotty
,
and
such
a
substitute
*NL*
for
what
I
had
lost
as
my
excellent
and
generous
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
nearest
way
to
Yarmouth
,
in
coming
back
from
these
long
walks
,
was
by
*NL*
a
ferry
.
It
landed
me
on
the
flat
between
the
town
and
the
sea
,
which
I
*NL*
could
make
straight
across
,
and
so
save
myself
a
considerable
circuit
by
*NL*
the
high
road
.
Mr.
Peggotty
's
house
being
on
that
waste-place
,
and
not
a
*NL*
hundred
yards
out
of
my
track
,
I
always
looked
in
as
I
went
by
.
*NL*
Steerforth
was
pretty
sure
to
be
there
expecting
me
,
and
we
went
on
*NL*
together
through
the
frosty
air
and
gathering
fog
towards
the
twinkling
*NL*
lights
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
dark
evening
,
when
I
was
later
than
usual
--
for
I
had
,
that
day
,
been
*NL*
making
my
parting
visit
to
Blunderstone
,
as
we
were
now
about
to
return
*NL*
home
--
I
found
him
alone
in
Mr.
Peggotty
's
house
,
sitting
thoughtfully
*NL*
before
the
fire
.
He
was
so
intent
upon
his
own
reflections
that
he
was
*NL*
quite
unconscious
of
my
approach
.
This
,
indeed
,
he
might
easily
have
*NL*
been
if
he
had
been
less
absorbed
,
for
footsteps
fell
noiselessly
on
the
*NL*
sandy
ground
outside
;
but
even
my
entrance
failed
to
rouse
him
.
I
was
*NL*
standing
close
to
him
,
looking
at
him
;
and
still
,
with
a
heavy
brow
,
he
*NL*
was
lost
in
his
meditations
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
such
a
start
when
I
put
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
that
he
made
*NL*
me
start
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
upon
me
,
''
he
said
,
almost
angrily
,
``
like
a
reproachful
ghost
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
obliged
to
announce
myself
somehow
,
''
I
replied
.
``
Have
I
called
*NL*
you
down
from
the
stars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
.
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
from
anywhere
,
then
?
''
said
I
,
taking
my
seat
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
looking
at
the
pictures
in
the
fire
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
spoiling
them
for
me
,
''
said
I
,
as
he
stirred
it
quickly
*NL*
with
a
piece
of
burning
wood
,
striking
out
of
it
a
train
of
red-hot
*NL*
sparks
that
went
careering
up
the
little
chimney
,
and
roaring
out
into
*NL*
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
have
seen
them
,
''
he
returned
.
``
I
detest
this
mongrel
*NL*
time
,
neither
day
nor
night
.
How
late
you
are
!
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
taking
leave
of
my
usual
walk
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
been
sitting
here
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
glancing
round
the
*NL*
room
,
``
thinking
that
all
the
people
we
found
so
glad
on
the
night
of
*NL*
our
coming
down
,
might
--
to
judge
from
the
present
wasted
air
of
the
*NL*
place
--
be
dispersed
,
or
dead
,
or
come
to
I
do
n't
know
what
harm
.
David
,
*NL*
I
wish
to
God
I
had
had
a
judicious
father
these
last
twenty
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Steerforth
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
I
had
been
better
guided
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
*NL*
wish
with
all
my
soul
I
could
guide
myself
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
passionate
dejection
in
his
manner
that
quite
amazed
me
.
He
*NL*
was
more
unlike
himself
than
I
could
have
supposed
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
better
to
be
this
poor
Peggotty
,
or
his
lout
of
a
nephew
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
getting
up
and
leaning
moodily
against
the
chimney-piece
,
with
*NL*
his
face
towards
the
fire
,
``
than
to
be
myself
,
twenty
times
richer
and
*NL*
twenty
times
wiser
,
and
be
the
torment
to
myself
that
I
have
been
,
in
*NL*
this
Devil
's
bark
of
a
boat
,
within
the
last
half-hour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
confounded
by
the
alteration
in
him
,
that
at
first
I
could
only
*NL*
observe
him
in
silence
,
as
he
stood
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
looking
gloomily
down
at
the
fire
.
At
length
I
begged
him
,
with
all
the
*NL*
earnestness
I
felt
,
to
tell
me
what
had
occurred
to
cross
him
so
*NL*
unusually
,
and
to
let
me
sympathise
with
him
,
if
I
could
not
hope
to
*NL*
advise
him
.
Before
I
had
well
concluded
,
he
began
to
laugh
--
fretfully
at
*NL*
first
,
but
soon
with
returning
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
it
's
nothing
,
Daisy
!
nothing
!
''
he
replied
.
``
I
told
you
,
at
the
inn
*NL*
in
London
,
I
am
heavy
company
for
myself
,
sometimes
.
I
have
been
a
*NL*
nightmare
to
myself
,
just
now
--
must
have
had
one
,
I
think
.
At
odd
dull
*NL*
times
,
nursery
tales
come
up
into
the
memory
,
unrecognised
for
what
they
*NL*
are
.
I
believe
I
have
been
confounding
myself
with
the
bad
boy
who
*NL*
`
did
n't
care
,
'
and
became
food
for
lions
--
a
grander
kind
of
going
to
the
*NL*
dogs
,
I
suppose
.
What
old
women
call
the
horrors
,
have
been
creeping
*NL*
over
me
from
head
to
foot
.
I
have
been
afraid
of
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
afraid
of
nothing
else

I
think
,

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
,
and
yet
may
have
enough
to
be
afraid
of
too

he
answered
.
*NL*
``
Well
!
So
it
goes
by
!
I
am
not
about
to
be
hipped
again
,
David
;

I
*NL*
tell
you
,
my
good
fellow
,
once
more

that
it
would
have
been
well
for
me

for
more
than
me
-RRB-
if
I
had
had
a
steadfast
and
judicious
father

*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
always
full
of
expression
,
but
I
never
saw
it
express
such
*NL*
a
dark
kind
of
earnestness
as
when
he
said
these
words
,
with
his
glance
*NL*
bent
on
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
for
that
!
''
he
said
,
making
as
if
he
tossed
something
light
into
*NL*
the
air
,
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why

being
gone

am
a
man
again

*NL*
like
Macbeth

And
now
for
dinner
!
If
I
have
not
-LRB-
Macbeth-like
-RRB-
broken
up
*NL*
the
feast
with
most
admired
disorder

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
they
all
,
I
wonder
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
After
strolling
to
the
ferry
looking
for
*NL*
you
,
I
strolled
in
here
and
found
the
place
deserted
.
That
set
me
*NL*
thinking
,
and
you
found
me
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
advent
of
Mrs.
Gummidge
with
a
basket
,
explained
how
the
house
had
*NL*
happened
to
be
empty
.
She
had
hurried
out
to
buy
something
that
was
*NL*
needed
,
against
Mr.
Peggotty
's
return
with
the
tide
;
and
had
left
the
*NL*
door
open
in
the
meanwhile
,
lest
Ham
and
little
Em
`
ly
,
with
whom
it
was
*NL*
an
early
night
,
should
come
home
while
she
was
gone
.
Steerforth
,
after
*NL*
very
much
improving
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
spirits
by
a
cheerful
salutation
,
*NL*
and
a
jocose
embrace
,
took
my
arm
,
and
hurried
me
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
improved
his
own
spirits
,
no
less
than
Mrs.
Gummidge
's
,
for
they
*NL*
were
again
at
their
usual
flow
,
and
he
was
full
of
vivacious
*NL*
conversation
as
we
went
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
''
he
said
,
gaily
,
``
we
abandon
this
buccaneer
life
to-morrow
,
do
*NL*
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
agreed
,

I
returned
.
``
And
our
places
by
the
coach
are
taken

you

know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
there
's
no
help
for
it

I
suppose

said
Steerforth
.
``
I
have
almost
*NL*
forgotten
that
there
is
anything
to
do
in
the
world

to
go
out

tossing
on
the
sea
here

I
wish
there
was
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
long
as
the
novelty
should
last

said
I
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
enough

''
he
returned
;
``
though
there
's
a
sarcastic
meaning
in
that
*NL*
observation

an
amiable
piece
of
innocence
like
my

.
*NL*
Well
!
I
dare
say
I
am
a
capricious
fellow

David
.
I
know
I
am
;
but
while
*NL*
the
iron
is
hot
,
I
can
strike
it
vigorously
too

I
could
pass
a
*NL*
reasonably
good
examination
already

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
A

phenomenon

eh

laughed
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
he
does
,
and
you
know
how
truly

knowing
how
ardent
you
are
in

any
pursuit
you
follow
,
and
how
easily
you
can
master
it
.
And
that
*NL*
amazes
me
most
in
you

Steerforth

that
you
should
be
contented
with
*NL*
such
fitful
uses
of
your
powers

*NL*
*NL*
``
Contented

he
answered

merrily

``
I
am
never
contented

with

your
freshness

As
to
fitfulness

have
never
learnt

the
art

binding
myself
to
any
of
the
wheels
on
which
the
Ixions
of
*NL*
these
days
are
turning
round
and
round

I
missed
it
somehow
in
a
bad
*NL*
apprenticeship
,
and
now
do
n't
care
about
it

You
know
I
have
bought
a

boat
down
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
extraordinary
fellow
you
are

I
exclaimed
,
*NL*
stopping

for
this
was
the
first
I
had
heard
of
it

When

never

care

come

returned

taken

fancy

all
events

walking
me
briskly
on

sorrow

honest

was
indifferent

``
Aye

let
it
rest

have
said
enough

*NL*
*NL*
Afraid
of
offending
him
by
pursuing
the
subject
when
he
made
so
light
of
*NL*
it
,
I
only
pursued
it
in
my
thoughts
as
we
went
on
at
even
a
quicker
*NL*
pace
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
be
newly
rigged

said
Steerforth
,
``

I
shall
leave

Did
I
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
As
our
looks
met
,
I
observed
that
he
was
pale
even
to
his
lips
,
though
*NL*
he
looked
very
steadily
at
me
.
I
feared
that
some
difference
between
him
*NL*
and
his
mother
might
have
led
to
his
being
in
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
*NL*
I
had
found
him
at
the
solitary
fireside
.
I
hinted
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
giving
a
slight
laugh
.
``
Nothing
*NL*
of
the
sort

Yes

He
is
come
down

that
man
of
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

I.

*NL*
``

I
asked

As
he
had
continued
to
look
steadily
at
me
,
I
took
it
as
a
reminder
that
*NL*
he
objected
to
being
extolled
for
his
consideration

I
could
not
help
*NL*
showing
in
my
face
how
much
it
pleased
me

I
said
little

and
he
*NL*
resumed
his
usual
smile

and
seemed
relieved

*NL*
*NL*
``

comes
!
And
that
fellow
with
her
,
eh
?
Upon
my
soul
,
he
's
a
true
*NL*
knight
.
He
never
leaves
her
!

*NL*
Ham
was
a
boat-builder
in
these
days
,
having
improved
a
natural
*NL*
ingenuity
in
that
handicraft
,
until
he
had
become
a
skilled
workman
.
He
*NL*
was
in
his
working-dress
,
and
looked
rugged
enough
,
but
manly
withal
,
*NL*
and
a
very
fit
protector
for
the
blooming
little
creature
at
his
side
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
there
was
a
frankness
in
his
face
,
an
honesty
,
and
an
*NL*
undisguised
show
of
his
pride
in
her
,
and
his
love
for
her
,
which
were
,
*NL*
to
me
,
the
best
of
good
looks
.
I
thought
,
as
they
came
towards
us
,
that
*NL*
they
were
well
matched
even
in
that
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
withdrew
her
hand
timidly
from
his
arm
as
we
stopped
to
speak
to
*NL*
them
,
and
blushed
as
she
gave
it
to
Steerforth
and
to
me
.
When
they
*NL*
passed
on
,
after
we
had
exchanged
a
few
words
,
she
did
not
like
to
*NL*
replace
that
hand
,
but
,
still
appearing
timid
and
constrained
,
walked
by
*NL*
herself
.
I
thought
all
this
very
pretty
and
engaging
,
and
Steerforth
*NL*
seemed
to
think
so
too
,
as
we
looked
after
them
fading
away
in
the
light
*NL*
of
a
young
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
there
passed
us
--
evidently
following
them
--
a
young
woman
whose
*NL*
approach
we
had
not
observed
,
but
whose
face
I
saw
as
she
went
by
,
and
*NL*
thought
I
had
a
faint
remembrance
of
.
She
was
lightly
dressed
;
looked
*NL*
bold
,
and
haggard
,
and
flaunting
,
and
poor
;
but
seemed
,
for
the
time
,
to
*NL*
have
given
all
that
to
the
wind
which
was
blowing
,
and
to
have
nothing
*NL*
in
her
mind
but
going
after
them
.
As
the
dark
distant
level
,
absorbing
*NL*
their
figures
into
itself
,
left
but
itself
visible
between
us
and
the
*NL*
sea
and
clouds
,
her
figure
disappeared
in
like
manner
,
still
no
nearer
*NL*
to
them
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
black
shadow
to
be
following
the
girl
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
*NL*
standing
still
;
``
what
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
in
a
low
voice
that
sounded
almost
strange
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
have
it
in
her
mind
to
beg
of
them
,
I
think
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
beggar
would
be
no
novelty
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
but
it
is
a
strange
*NL*
thing
that
the
beggar
should
take
that
shape
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
no
better
reason
,
truly
,
than
because
I
was
thinking
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
after
a
pause
,
``
of
something
like
it
,
when
it
came
by
.
Where
the
Devil
*NL*
did
it
come
from
,
I
wonder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
shadow
of
this
wall
,
I
think
,
''
said
I
,
as
we
emerged
upon
a
*NL*
road
on
which
a
wall
abutted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
gone
!
''
he
returned
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
``
And
all
ill
go
*NL*
with
it
.
Now
for
our
dinner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
he
looked
again
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
sea-line
glimmering
*NL*
afar
off
;
and
yet
again
.
And
he
wondered
about
it
,
in
some
broken
*NL*
expressions
,
several
times
,
in
the
short
remainder
of
our
walk
;
and
only
*NL*
seemed
to
forget
it
when
the
light
of
fire
and
candle
shone
upon
us
,
*NL*
seated
warm
and
merry
,
at
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Littimer
was
there
,
and
had
his
usual
effect
upon
me
.
When
I
said
to
him
*NL*
that
I
hoped
Mrs.
Steerforth
and
Miss
Dartle
were
well
,
he
answered
*NL*
respectfully
-LRB-
and
of
course
respectably
-RRB-
,
that
they
were
tolerably
well
,
*NL*
he
thanked
me
,
and
had
sent
their
compliments
.
This
was
all
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
say
as
plainly
as
a
man
could
say
:
``
You
are
very
young
,
*NL*
sir
;
you
are
exceedingly
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
almost
finished
dinner
,
when
taking
a
step
or
two
towards
the
*NL*
table
,
from
the
corner
where
he
kept
watch
upon
us
,
or
rather
upon
me
,
*NL*
as
I
felt
,
he
said
to
his
master
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
Miss
Mowcher
is
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
cried
Steerforth
,
much
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Mowcher
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
on
earth
does
_
she
_
do
here
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
to
be
her
native
part
of
the
country
,
sir
.
She
informs
me
*NL*
that
she
makes
one
of
her
professional
visits
here
,
every
year
,
sir
.
I
*NL*
met
her
in
the
street
this
afternoon
,
and
she
wished
to
know
if
she
*NL*
might
have
the
honor
of
waiting
on
you
after
dinner
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
Giantess
in
question
,
Daisy
?
''
inquired
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
confess
--
I
felt
ashamed
,
even
of
being
at
this
*NL*
disadvantage
before
Littimer
--
that
Miss
Mowcher
and
I
were
wholly
*NL*
unacquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
shall
know
her
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
for
she
is
one
of
the
seven
*NL*
wonders
of
the
world
.
When
Miss
Mowcher
comes
,
show
her
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
some
curiosity
and
excitement
about
this
lady
,
especially
as
*NL*
Steerforth
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughing
when
I
referred
to
her
,
and
*NL*
positively
refused
to
answer
any
question
of
which
I
made
her
the
*NL*
subject
.
I
remained
,
therefore
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
expectation
*NL*
until
the
cloth
had
been
removed
some
half
an
hour
,
and
we
were
sitting
*NL*
over
our
decanter
of
wine
before
the
fire
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
*NL*
Littimer
,
with
his
habitual
serenity
quite
undisturbed
,
announced
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Mowcher
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
the
doorway
and
saw
nothing
.
I
was
still
looking
at
the
*NL*
doorway
,
thinking
that
Miss
Mowcher
was
a
long
while
making
her
*NL*
appearance
,
when
,
to
my
infinite
astonishment
,
there
came
waddling
round
*NL*
a
sofa
which
stood
between
me
and
it
,
a
pursy
dwarf
,
of
about
forty
or
*NL*
forty-five
,
with
a
very
large
head
and
face
,
a
pair
of
roguish
grey
*NL*
eyes
,
and
such
extremely
little
arms
,
that
,
to
enable
herself
to
lay
a
*NL*
finger
archly
against
her
snub
nose
,
as
she
ogled
Steerforth
,
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
meet
the
finger
half-way
,
and
lay
her
nose
against
it
.
Her
*NL*
chin
,
which
was
what
is
called
a
double-chin
,
was
so
fat
that
it
*NL*
entirely
swallowed
up
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
,
bow
and
all
.
Throat
she
*NL*
had
none
;
waist
she
had
none
;
legs
she
had
none
,
worth
mentioning
;
for
*NL*
though
she
was
more
than
full-sized
down
to
where
her
waist
would
have
*NL*
been
,
if
she
had
had
any
,
and
though
she
terminated
,
as
human
beings
*NL*
generally
do
,
in
a
pair
of
feet
,
she
was
so
short
that
she
stood
at
a
*NL*
common-sized
chair
as
at
a
table
,
resting
a
bag
she
carried
on
the
seat
.
*NL*
This
lady
;
dressed
in
an
off-hand
,
easy
style
;
bringing
her
nose
and
her
*NL*
forefinger
together
,
with
the
difficulty
I
have
described
;
standing
with
*NL*
her
head
necessarily
on
one
side
,
and
,
with
one
of
her
sharp
eyes
shut
*NL*
up
,
making
an
uncommonly
knowing
face
;
after
ogling
Steerforth
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
broke
into
a
torrent
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
My
flower
!
''
she
pleasantly
began
,
shaking
her
large
head
at
him
.
*NL*
``
You
're
there
,
are
you
!
Oh
,
you
naughty
boy
,
fie
for
shame
,
what
do
you
*NL*
do
so
far
away
from
home
?
Up
to
mischief
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
Oh
,
you
're
a
*NL*
downy
fellow
,
Steerforth
,
so
you
are
,
and
I
'm
another
,
ai
n't
I
?
Ha
,
ha
,
*NL*
ha
!
You
'd
have
betted
a
hundred
pound
to
five
,
now
,
that
you
would
n't
*NL*
have
seen
me
here
,
would
n't
you
?
Bless
you
,
man
alive
,
I
'm
everywhere
.
*NL*
I
'm
here
and
there
,
and
where
not
,
like
the
conjuror
's
half-crown
*NL*
in
the
lady
's
handkercher
.
Talking
of
hankerchers

talking
of

ladies

what
a
comfort
you
are
to
your
blessed
mother

you
,
my
*NL*
dear
boy

over
one
of
my
shoulders

I
do

which
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mowcher
untied
her
bonnet
,
at
this
passage
of
her
discourse
,
threw
*NL*
back
the
strings
,
and
sat
down
,
panting
,
on
a
footstool
in
front
of
the
*NL*
fire
--
making
a
kind
of
arbor
of
the
dining-table
,
which
spread
its
*NL*
mahogany
shelter
above
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
stars
and
what
's
-
their-names
!
''
she
went
on
,
clapping
a
hand
on
*NL*
each
of
her
little
knees
,
and
glancing
shrewdly
at
me
,
``
I
'm
of
too
full
*NL*
a
habit
,
that
's
the
fact
,
Steerforth
.
After
a
flight
of
stairs
,
it
gives
*NL*
me
as
much
trouble
to
draw
every
breath
I
want
,
as
if
it
was
a
bucket
of
*NL*
water
.
If
you
saw
me
looking
out
of
an
upper
window
,
you
'd
think
I
was
a
*NL*
fine
woman
,
would
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
that

wherever
I
saw
you

replied
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
,
you
dog
,
do
!
''
cried
the
little
creature
,
making
a
whisk
at
*NL*
him
with
the
handkerchief
with
which
she
was
wiping
her
face
,
``
and
do
n't
*NL*
be
impudent
!
But
I
give
you
my
word
and
honor
I
was
at
Lady
Mithers
's
*NL*
last
week
--
_
there
's
_
a
woman
!
How
_
she

wears

and
Mithers
himself
came
*NL*
into
the
room
where
I
was
waiting
for
her
--
_
there
's

a

How
_
he

*NL*
wears

and
his
wig
too

for
he
's
had
it
these
ten
years

and
he
went
on
*NL*
at
that
rate
in
the
complimentary
line
,
that
I
began
to
think
I
should
*NL*
be
obliged
to
ring
the
bell
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
He
's
a
pleasant
wretch

but
he
*NL*
wants
principle

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
for
Lady
Mithers
?
''
asked
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
tellings
,
my
blessed
infant

''
she
retorted
,
tapping
her
nose
*NL*
again
,
screwing
up
her
face
,
and
twinkling
her
eyes
like
an
imp
of
*NL*
supernatural
intelligence
.
``
Never
_
you

mind

You
'd
like

hair
from
falling
off

or
dye
it
,
or
touch
up
her
*NL*
complexion
,
or
improve
her
eyebrows

would
n't
you
?
And
so
you
shall

my

darling

when
I
tell
you
!
Do
you
know
what
my
great
grandfather
's

was

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Walker
,
my
sweet
pet
,
''
replied
Miss
Mowcher
,
``
and
he
came
of
a
*NL*
long
line
of
Walkers
,
that
I
inherit
all
the
Hookey
estates
from

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
beheld
anything
approaching
to
Miss
Mowcher
's
wink
,
except
Miss
*NL*
Mowcher
's
self-possession
.
She
had
a
wonderful
way
too
,
when
listening
*NL*
to
what
was
said
to
her
,
or
when
waiting
for
an
answer
to
what
she
had
*NL*
said
herself
,
of
pausing
with
her
head
cunningly
on
one
side
,
and
one
*NL*
eye
turned
up
like
a
magpie
's
.
Altogether
I
was
lost
in
amazement
,
and
*NL*
sat
staring
at
her
,
quite
oblivious
,
I
am
afraid
,
of
the
laws
of
*NL*
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
by
this
time
drawn
the
chair
to
her
side
,
and
was
busily
engaged
*NL*
in
producing
from
the
bag
-LRB-
plunging
in
her
short
arm
to
the
shoulder
,
at
*NL*
every
dive
-RRB-
a
number
of
small
bottles
,
sponges
,
combs
,
brushes
,
bits
of
*NL*
flannel
,
little
pairs
of
curling
irons
,
and
other
instruments
,
which
she
*NL*
tumbled
in
a
heap
upon
the
chair
.
From
this
employment
she
suddenly
*NL*
desisted
,
and
said
to
Steerforth
,
much
to
my
confusion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
your
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield

''
said
Steerforth
;
``
he
wants
to
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
he
shall
!
I
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
did
!
''
returned
Miss
*NL*
Mowcher
,
waddling
up
to
me
,
bag
in
hand
,
and
laughing
on
me
as
she
came
.
*NL*
``
Face
like
a
peach
!
''
standing
on
tiptoe
to
pinch
my
cheek
as
I
sat
.
*NL*
``
Quite
tempting
!
I
'm
very
fond
of
peaches

Happy
to
make
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Copperfield

I
'm
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
that
I
congratulated
myself
on
having
the
honor
to
make
hers
,
and
*NL*
that
the
happiness
was
mutual

*NL*
``
Oh
my
goodness

how
polite
we

exclaimed
Miss
Mowcher
,
making
a
*NL*
preposterous
attempt
to
cover
her
large
face

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
addressed
confidentially
to
both
of
us
,
as
the
morsel
of
a
hand
*NL*
came
away
from
the
face
,
and
buried
itself
,
arm
and
all
,
in
the
bag
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

you

Mowcher

Steerforth

*NL*
``

replied
that
morsel
of
a

feeling
in

with

head
on

her

in

something
out

None

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
your

said
Steerforth

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mowcher
winked
assent

``
Forced

it
did
very
well
in

it
was
*NL*
no

here
.
You
never
saw
such
a
rusty
Prince
in
all
your
born
days
as
*NL*
he
was
.
Like
old
iron
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
why
you
called
him
a
humbug
,
just
now
?

inquired
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
a
broth
of
a

you

returned
Miss
Mowcher
,
shaking
*NL*
her
head
violently
.
``
I
said
,
what
a

humbugs
we
were
in
general

*NL*
and
I
showed
you
the
scraps
of
the
Prince
's
nails
to
prove
it
.
The
*NL*
Prince
's
nails
do
more
for
me
,
in
private
families
of
the
genteel
sort
,
*NL*
than
all
my

put
together

I
always
carry
'em
about

They
're
the
*NL*
best
introduction

If
Miss

cuts
the
Prince

she

must
_
*NL*
be
all
right

I
give
'em
away

in

I
believe

!
Upon
my

the
whole

*NL*
-LRB-

call
it
when

make
speeches

said
this
least
of
women
,
trying
to
fold
her
short
*NL*
arms
,
and
nodding
her
large
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
laughed
heartily
,
and
I
laughed
too
.
Miss
Mowcher
continuing
*NL*
all
the
time
to
shake
her
head
-LRB-
which
was
very
much
on
one
side
-RRB-
,
and
to
*NL*
look
into
the
air
with
one
eye
,
and
to
wink
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
she
said
,
smiting
her
small
knees
,
and
rising
,
``
this
is
*NL*
not
business

Come

Steerforth

explore

regions

have
it
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
selected
two
or
three
of
the
little
instruments
,
and
a
little
*NL*
bottle
,
and
asked
-LRB-
to
my
surprise
-RRB-
if
the
table
would
bear
.
On
*NL*
Steerforth
's
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
she
pushed
a
chair
against
it
,
*NL*
and
begging
the
assistance
of
my
hand
,
mounted
up
,
pretty
nimbly
,
to
the
*NL*
top
,
as
if
it
were
a
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
either
of
you
saw
my
ankles
,
''
she
said
,
when
she
was
safely
*NL*
elevated
,
``
say
so
,

I
'll
go
home

destroy
myself

*NL*
*NL*

Steerforth

*NL*
*NL*

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

cried
Miss

,
``
I
'll

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
invocation
to
Steerforth
to
place
himself
under
her
hands
;
*NL*
who
,
accordingly
,
sat
himself
down
,
with
his
back
to
the
table
,
and
his
*NL*
laughing
face
towards
me
,
and
submitted
his
head
to
her
inspection
,
*NL*
evidently
for
no
other
purpose
than
our
entertainment
.
To
see
Miss
*NL*
Mowcher
standing
over
him
,
looking
at
his
rich
profusion
of
brown
hair
*NL*
through
a
large
round
magnifying
glass
,
which
she
took
out
of
her
*NL*
pocket
,
was
a
most
amazing
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
're
_
a
pretty
fellow
!
''
said
Miss
Mowcher
,
after
a
brief
inspection
.
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
as
bald
as
a
friar
on
the
top
of
your
head
in
twelve
months

for
me
.
Just
half-a-minute
,
my
young
friend

and
we
'll
give
you
a
*NL*
polishing
that
shall
keep
your
curls
on
for
the
next
ten
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
she
tilted
some
of
the
contents
of
the
little
bottle
on
to
*NL*
one
of
the
little
bits
of
flannel
,
and
,
again
imparting
some
of
the
*NL*
virtues
of
that
preparation
to
one
of
the
little
brushes
,
began
rubbing
*NL*
and
scraping
away
with
both
on
the
crown
of
Steerforth
's
head
in
the
*NL*
busiest
manner
I
ever
witnessed
,
talking
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Charley
Pyegrave

the
duke

she
said

``
You

peeping
round
into
his
face

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

said
Steerforth

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mad

Steerforth

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks

returned
Miss

Mowcher
.
``

does

do

Something

asked
Steerforth

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Miss

stopping
to
slap
his
cheek
.
``
To

doctor
his

There
was
a
woman
in

shop

elderly
female

quite
a
Griffin

who
had
never
even
heard

*NL*
Miss
Mowcher

rubbing
all
the
time
as
busily
as
ever
,

another

instance
of
the
refreshing
humbug
I
was
speaking
of

I
_
do
something

in

way

perhaps
a
good

perhaps
a
little

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

way
do
you
mean

In

Steerforth

*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
this
and
that
together

the
wary
*NL*
Mowcher
,
touching
her
nose
,
``
work
it
by
the
rule

Secrets

all

trades

give
you

I
say
_
I
_
do
a
*NL*
little
in
that
way
myself

One
Dowager

I

call
it

I
*NL*
supply
it
for
'em

we
keep
up
the
trick
so

to
one
another

make
*NL*
believe
with
such
a

that
they

as
soon

laying

am

looking

refreshing

*NL*
*NL*
I
never
did
in
my
days
behold
anything
like
Mowcher
as
she
stood
upon
*NL*
the
dining-table
,
intensely
enjoying
this
refreshment
,
rubbing
busily
at
*NL*
Steerforth
's
head
,
and
winking
at
me
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
said
.
``
Such
things
are
not
much
in
demand
hereabouts

That
*NL*
sets
me
off
again

I
have

seen
a
pretty
woman
since
I
've
been
here

*NL*
Jemmy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
ghost
of
one

''
replied
Miss
Mowcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
show
her
the
substance
of
one

I
think

said
Steerforth
,
*NL*
addressing
his
eyes
to
mine
.
``
Eh

Daisy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha

cried
the
little
creature
,
glancing
sharply
at
my
face
,
and
then
*NL*
peeping
round
at
Steerforth
's
.
``
Umph
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
exclamation
sounded
like
a
question
put
to
both
of
us
,
and
the
*NL*
second
like
a
question
put
to
Steerforth
only
.
She
seemed
to
have
found
*NL*
no
answer
to
either
,
but
continued
to
rub
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
*NL*
her
eye
turned
up
,
as
if
she
were
looking
for
an
answer
in
the
air
,
and
*NL*
were
confident
of
its
appearing
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sister
of
yours
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
''
she
cried
,
after
a
pause
,
and
*NL*
still
keeping
the
same
look
out
.
``
Aye
,
aye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
before
I
could
reply
.
``
Nothing

sort

On

the
contrary

Mr.
Copperfield

I

to
have
a
*NL*
great
admiration
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
has
n't
he
now
?
''
returned
Miss
Mowcher
.
``
Is
he
fickle
?
oh
,
for
*NL*
shame
!
Did
he
sip
every
flower
,
and
change
every
hour
,
until
Polly
his
*NL*
passion
requited
?
--
Is
her
name
Polly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Elfin
suddenness
with
which
she
pounced
upon
me
with
this
question
,
*NL*
and
a
searching
look
,
quite
disconcerted
me
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Miss
Mowcher
,
''
I
replied
.
``
Her
name
is
Emily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
?
''
she
cried
exactly
as
before
.
``
Umph
?
What
a
rattle
I
am
!
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
ai
n't
I
volatile
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
and
look
implied
something
that
was
not
agreeable
to
me
in
*NL*
connexion
with
the
subject
.
So
I
said
,
in
a
graver
manner
than
any
of
us
*NL*
had
yet
assumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
as
virtuous
as
she
is
pretty

She
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
*NL*
most
worthy
and
deserving
man
in
her
own
station
of
life
.
I
esteem
her
*NL*
for
her
good
sense
,
as
much
as
I
admire
her
for
her
good
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
!
''
cried
Steerforth
.
``
Hear
,
hear
,
hear

Now
,
I
'll
quench
the
*NL*
curiosity
of
this
little
Fatima
,
my
dear
Daisy
,
by
leaving
her
nothing
*NL*
to
guess
at
.
She
is
at
present
apprenticed

Miss
Mowcher

or
articled

*NL*
or
whatever
it
may
be

to
Omer

Joram

Haberdashers
,
Milliners
,
and
*NL*
so
forth
,
in
this
town

Do
you
observe
?
Omer
and
Joram

The
promise
of
*NL*
which
my
friend
has
spoken
,
is
made
and
entered
into

her
cousin

*NL*
Christian
name

unknown

Peggotty

She

the

most
engaging

I
admire
her

exceedingly

to
*NL*
disparage
her
Intended
,
which
I
know
my
friend
would
not
like
,
I
would
*NL*
add
,
that
to
_
me
_
she
seems
to
be
throwing
herself
away
;
that
I
am
sure
*NL*
she
might
do
better
;
and
that
I
swear
she
was
born
to
be
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mowcher
listened
to
these
words
,
which
were
very
slowly
and
*NL*
distinctly
spoken
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
her
eye
in
the
air
as
*NL*
if
she
were
still
looking
for
that
answer
.
When
he
ceased
,
she
became
*NL*
brisk
again
in
an
instant
,
and
rattled
away
with
surprising
volubility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
And
that
's
all
about
it
,
is
it
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
trimming
his
*NL*
whiskers
with
a
little
restless
pair
of
scissors
,
that
went
glancing
*NL*
round
his
head
in
all
directions
.
``
Very
well
:
_
very
_
well
!
Quite
a
long
*NL*
story
.
Ought
to
end
,
`
and
they
lived
happy
ever
afterwards
;
'
ought
n't
*NL*
it
?
Ah
!
What
's
that
game
at
forfeits
?
I
love
my
love
with
an
E
,
because
*NL*
she
's
enticing
;
I
hate
her
with
an
E
,
because
she
's
engaged
.
I
took
her
*NL*
to
the
sign
of
the
exquisite
,
and
treated
her
with
an
elopement
,
her
*NL*
name
's
Emily
,
and
she
lives
in
the
east
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
Mr.
Copperfield
,
*NL*
ai
n't
I
volatile
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Merely
looking
at
me
with
extravagant
slyness
,
and
not
waiting
for
any
*NL*
reply
,
she
continued
,
without
drawing
breath
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
If
ever
any
scapegrace
was
trimmed
and
touched
up
to
perfection

*NL*
you
are

If
I
understand

Do

hear
me
when
I
tell
you
that

I

''
peeping
down
into
his
face
.
``
Now
you
may
mizzle

*NL*
Jemmy

we
say
at
Court

'll
operate
on
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say

Daisy

''
inquired
Steerforth
,
laughing
,
and
resigning
*NL*
his
seat
.
``
Will
you
be
improved
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

Miss
Mowcher
,
not
this
evening

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
no
,
''
returned
the
little
woman
,
looking
at
me
with
the
aspect
*NL*
of
a
connoisseur
;
``
a
little
bit
more
eyebrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
I
returned
,
``
some
other
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
it
carried
half
a
quarter
of
an
inch
towards

said
*NL*
Miss
Mowcher
.
``
We
can
do
it
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you

Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
for
a
tip

''
she
urged
.
``
No
?
Let
's
get
the
scaffolding
up
,
then
,
*NL*
for
a
pair
of
whiskers
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
blushing
as
I
declined
,
for
I
felt
we
were
on
my
weak
*NL*
point
,
now
.
But
Miss
Mowcher
,
finding
that
I
was
not
at
present
disposed
*NL*
for
any
decoration
within
the
range
of
her
art
,
and
that
I
was
,
for
the
*NL*
time
being
,
proof
against
the
blandishments
of
the
small
bottle
which
*NL*
she
held
up
before
one
eye
to
enforce
her
persuasions
,
said
we
would
*NL*
make
a
beginning
on
an
early
day
,
and
requested
the
aid
of
my
hand
to
*NL*
descend
from
her
elevated
station
.
Thus
assisted
,
she
skipped
down
with
*NL*
much
agility
,
and
began
to
tie
her
double
chin
into
her
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fee
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
bob
,
''
replied
Miss
Mowcher
,
``
and
dirt-cheap
,
my
chicken
.
Ai
n't
I
*NL*
volatile
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
politely
:
``
Not
at
all
.
''
But
I
thought
she
was
rather
so
,
when
*NL*
she
tossed
up
his
two
half-crowns
like
a
goblin
pieman
,
caught
them
,
*NL*
dropped
them
in
her
pocket
,
and
gave
it
a
loud
slap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
Till
!
''
observed
Miss
Mowcher
,
standing
at
the
chair
again
,
*NL*
and
replacing
in
the
bag
the
miscellaneous
collection
of
little
objects
*NL*
she
had
emptied
out
of
it
.
``
Have
I
got
all
my
traps
?
It
seems
so
.
It
*NL*
wo
n't
do
to
be
like
long
Ned
Beadwood
,
when
they
took
him
to
church
`
to
*NL*
marry
him
to
somebody
,
'
as
he
says
,
and
left
the
bride
behind
.
Ha
!
ha
!
*NL*
ha
!
A
wicked
rascal
,
Ned
,
but
droll
!
Now
,
I
know
I
'm
going
to
break
your
*NL*
hearts
,
but
I
am
forced
to
leave
you
.
You
must
call
up
all
your
*NL*
fortitude
,
and
try
to
bear
it
.
Good
bye
,
Mr.
Copperfield
!
Take
care
of
*NL*
yourself
,
Jockey
of
Norfolk
!
How
I
_
have
_
been
rattling
on
!
It
's
all
the
*NL*
fault
of
you
two
wretches
.
_
I
_
forgive
you
!
`
Bob
swore
!
'
--
as
the
*NL*
Englishman
said
for
`
Good
night
,
'
when
he
first
learnt
French
,
and
*NL*
thought
it
so
like
English
.
`
Bob
swore
,
'
my
ducks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
bag
slung
over
her
arm
,
and
rattling
as
she
waddled
away
,
she
*NL*
waddled
to
the
door
;
where
she
stopped
to
inquire
if
she
should
leave
us
*NL*
a
lock
of
her
hair
.
``
Ai
n't
I
volatile
?
''
she
added
,
as
a
commentary
on
*NL*
this
offer
,
and
,
with
her
finger
on
her
nose
,
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
laughed
to
that
degree
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
help
*NL*
laughing
too
;
though
I
am
not
sure
I
should
have
done
so
,
but
for
this
*NL*
inducement
.
When
we
had
had
our
laugh
quite
out
,
which
was
after
some
*NL*
time
,
he
told
me
that
Miss
Mowcher
had
quite
an
extensive
connexion
,
and
*NL*
made
herself
useful
to
a
variety
of
people
in
a
variety
of
ways
.
Some
*NL*
people
trifled
with
her
as
a
mere
oddity
,
he
said
;
but
she
was
as
*NL*
shrewdly
and
sharply
observant
as
any
one
he
knew
,
and
as
long-headed
as
*NL*
she
was
short-armed
.
He
told
me
that
what
she
had
said
of
being
here
,
*NL*
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
was
true
enough
;
for
she
made
little
darts
*NL*
into
the
provinces
,
and
seemed
to
pick
up
customers
everywhere
,
and
to
*NL*
know
everybody
.
I
asked
him
what
her
disposition
was
:
whether
it
was
at
*NL*
all
mischievous
,
and
if
her
sympathies
were
generally
on
the
right
side
*NL*
of
things
:
but
,
not
succeeding
in
attracting
his
attention
to
these
*NL*
questions
after
two
or
three
attempts
,
I
forbore
or
forgot
to
repeat
*NL*
them
.
He
told
me
instead
,
with
much
rapidity
,
a
good
deal
about
her
*NL*
skill
,
and
her
profits
;
and
about
her
being
a
scientific
cupper
,
if
I
*NL*
should
ever
have
occasion
for
her
services
in
that
capacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
principal
theme
of
our
conversation
during
the
evening
:
and
*NL*
when
we
parted
for
the
night
Steerforth
called
after
me
over
the
*NL*
bannisters
,
``
Bob
swore
!
''
as
I
went
down
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
surprised
,
when
I
came
to
Mr.
Barkis
's
house
to
find
Ham
walking
*NL*
up
and
down
in
front
of
it
,
and
still
more
surprised
to
learn
from
him
*NL*
that
little
Em
`
ly
was
inside
.
I
naturally
inquired
why
he
was
not
there
*NL*
too
,
instead
of
pacing
the
street
by
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
rejoined
,
in
a
hesitating
manner
,
``
Em
`
ly
,
*NL*
she
's
talking
to
some
`
un
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
,
''
said
I
,
smiling
,
``
that
that
was
a
reason
for
*NL*
your
being
in
here
too
,
Ham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
in
a
general
way
,
so
'
t
would
be
,
''
he
returned
;
``
but
*NL*
look
`
ee
here
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
lowering
his
voice
,
and
speaking
very
*NL*
gravely
.
``
It
's
a
young
woman
,
sir
--
a
young
woman
,
that
Em
`
ly
knowed
*NL*
once

and
doe
n't
ought
to
know
no
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
heard
these
words
,
a
light
began
to
fall
upon
the
figure
I
had
*NL*
seen
following
them
,
some
hours
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
poor
wurem

said
Ham
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

met

*NL*
``
Keeping

cried
I

recalling
one
of

two

went
there

*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
how
true
this
was

I
knew
it

on
the

quite
as
well

Ham

*NL*
``

asks

*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
shaggy
jacket
,
and
took
out
with
*NL*
great
care
a
pretty
little
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
could
deny
her

the

Davy

*NL*
said
Ham
,
tenderly
adjusting
it
on
the
rough
palm
of
his
hand
,
``
how
*NL*
could
I
deny
her
when
she
give
me
this
to
carry
for

knowing
what

she
brought
it
for

Such
a
toy
as
it
is

said
Ham
,
thoughtfully
looking
*NL*
on
it
.
``
With
such
a
little
money
in
it

Em

my

*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
when
he
had
put
it
away
again
--
for
*NL*
that
was
more
satisfactory
to
me
than
saying
anything
--
and
we
walked
*NL*
up
and
down
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
in
silence
.
The
door
opened
then
,
*NL*
and
Peggotty
appeared
,
beckoning
to
Ham
to
come
in
.
I
would
have
kept
*NL*
away
,
but
she
came
after
me
,
entreating
me
to
come
in
too
.
Even
then
,
I
*NL*
would
have
avoided
the
room
where
they
all
were
,
but
for
its
being
the
*NL*
neat-tiled
kitchen
I
have
mentioned
more
than
once
.
The
door
opening
*NL*
immediately
into
it
,
I
found
myself
among
them
,
before
I
considered
*NL*
whither
I
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
--
the
same
I
had
seen
upon
the
sands
--
was
near
the
fire
.
She
was
*NL*
sitting
on
the
ground
,
with
her
head
and
one
arm
lying
on
a
chair
.
I
*NL*
fancied
,
from
the
disposition
of
her
figure
,
that
Em
`
ly
had
but
newly
*NL*
risen
from
the
chair
,
and
that
the
forlorn
head
might
perhaps
have
been
*NL*
lying
on
her
lap
.
I
saw
but
little
of
the
girl
's
face
,
over
which
her
*NL*
hair
fell
loose
and
scattered
,
as
if
she
had
been
disordering
it
with
*NL*
her
own
hands
;
but
I
saw
that
she
was
young
,
and
of
a
fair
complexion
.
*NL*
Peggotty
had
been
crying
.
So
had
little
Em
`
ly
.
Not
a
word
was
spoken
*NL*
when
we
first
went
in
;
and
the
Dutch
clock
by
the
dresser
seemed
,
in
the
*NL*
silence
,
to
tick
twice
as
loud
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Em
`
ly
spoke
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
wants
,
''
she
said
to
Ham
,
``
to
go
to
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
to
London
?
''
returned
Ham
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
between
them
,
looking
on
the
prostrate
girl
with
a
mixture
of
*NL*
compassion
for
her
,
and
of
jealousy
of
her
holding
any
companionship
*NL*
with
her
whom
he
loved
so
well
,
which
I
have
always
remembered
*NL*
distinctly
.
They
both
spoke
as
if
she
were
ill
;
in
a
soft
,
suppressed
*NL*
tone
that
was
plainly
heard
,
although
it
hardly
rose
above
a
whisper
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
there
than
here
,
''
said
a
third
voice
aloud
--
Martha
's
,
though
she
*NL*
did
not
move
.
``
No
one
knows
me
there
.
Everybody
knows
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
she
do
there
?
''
inquired
Ham
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
up
her
head
,
and
looked
darkly
round
at
him
for
a
moment
;
*NL*
then
laid
it
down
again
,
and
curved
her
right
arm
about
her
neck
,
as
a
*NL*
woman
in
a
fever
,
or
in
an
agony
of
pain
from
a
shot
,
might
twist
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
try
to
do
well
,
''
said
little
Em
`
ly
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
she
*NL*
has
said
to
us
.
Does
he
--
do
they
--
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
shook
her
head
compassionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
,
''
said
Martha
,
``
if
you
'll
help
me
away
.
I
never
can
do
worse
*NL*
than
I
have
done
here
.
I
may
do
better
.
Oh
!
''
with
a
dreadful
shiver
,
*NL*
``
take
me
out
of
these
streets
,
where
the
whole
town
knows
me
from
a
*NL*
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Em
`
ly
held
out
her
hand
to
Ham
,
I
saw
him
put
in
it
a
little
canvas
*NL*
bag
.
She
took
it
,
as
if
she
thought
it
were
her
purse
,
and
made
a
step
*NL*
or
two
forward
;
but
finding
her
mistake
,
came
back
to
where
he
had
*NL*
retired
near
me
,
and
showed
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
yourn
,
Em
`
ly
,
''
I
could
hear
him
say
.
``
I
have
n't

*NL*
the

It
ai
n't
of
no
delight
to
me
,
*NL*
except
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
rose
freshly
in
her
eyes
,
but
she
turned
away
,
and
went
to
*NL*
Martha
.
What
she
gave
her
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
saw
her
stooping
over
her
,
*NL*
and
putting
money
in
her
bosom
.
She
whispered
something
,
and
asked
was
*NL*
that
enough
?
``
More
than
enough
,
''
the
other
said
,
and
took
her
hand
and
*NL*
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Martha
arose
,
and
gathering
her
shawl
about
her
,
covering
her
face
*NL*
with
it
,
and
weeping
aloud
,
went
slowly
to
the
door
.
She
stopped
a
*NL*
moment
before
going
out
,
as
if
she
would
have
uttered
something
or
*NL*
turned
back
;
but
no
word
passed
her
lips
.
Making
the
same
low
,
dreary
,
*NL*
wretched
moaning
in
her
shawl
,
she
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
closed
,
little
Em
`
ly
looked
at
us
three
in
a
hurried
manner
,
*NL*
and
then
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
,
and
fell
to
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doe
n't

said
Ham
,
tapping
her
gently
on
the
shoulder
.
``

*NL*

You
doe

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

she
exclaimed
,
still
weeping
pitifully
,
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

cried
little
Em

sobbing

shaking
her

*NL*
*NL*
And
still
she
cried
,
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
try
your
love
too
much

she
sobbed
.
``
I

often

you

with

You

ever

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

she
cried
.
``
That

because

Oh

my
dear

it

have
been
a
better
fortune
for
you

if
you

been
fond

of
some

never

*NL*
*NL*
``

Ham
,
in
a
low
voice

``

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
had
hastened
to
the
chair
before
the
fire
.
Em
`
ly
,
with
her
arms
*NL*
around
her
neck
,
kneeled
by
her
,
looking
up
most
earnestly
into
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

pray

*NL*
for

better

I

more

I
want
to
feel
more
,
what
a
blessed
thing
it
is
to
be
the
wife
of
*NL*
a
good
man
,
and
to
lead
a
peaceful
life
.
Oh

oh
me
!
Oh
,
my

my
*NL*
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
face
on
my
old
nurse
's
breast
,
and
,
ceasing
this
*NL*
supplication
,
which
in
its
agony
and
grief
was
half
a
woman
's
,
half
a
*NL*
child
's
,
as
all
her
manner
was
-LRB-
being
,
in
that
,
more
natural
,
and
better
*NL*
suited
to
her
beauty
,
as
I
thought
,
than
any
other
manner
could
have
*NL*
been
-RRB-
,
wept
silently
,
while
my
old
nurse
hushed
her
like
an
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
calmer
by
degrees
,
and
then
we
soothed
her
;
now
talking
*NL*
encouragingly
,
and
now
jesting
a
little
with
her
,
until
she
began
to
*NL*
raise
her
head
and
speak
to
us
.
So
we
got
on
,
until
she
was
able
to
*NL*
smile
,
and
then
to
laugh
,
and
then
to
sit
up
,
half
ashamed
;
while
*NL*
Peggotty
recalled
her
stray
ringlets
,
dried
her
eyes
,
and
made
her
neat
*NL*
again
,
lest
her
uncle
should
wonder
,
when
she
got
home
,
why
his
darling
*NL*
had
been
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
her
do
,
that
night
,
what
I
had
never
seen
her
do
before
.
I
saw
her
*NL*
innocently
kiss
her
chosen
husband
on
the
cheek
,
and
creep
close
to
his
*NL*
bluff
form
as
if
it
were
her
best
support
.
When
they
went
away
together
,
*NL*
in
the
waning
moonlight
,
and
I
looked
after
them
,
comparing
their
*NL*
departure
in
my
mind
with
Martha
's
,
I
saw
that
she
held
his
arm
with
*NL*
both
her
hands
,
and
still
kept
close
to
him
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
CORROBORATE
MR.
DICK
,
AND
CHOOSE
A
PROFESSION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
awoke
in
the
morning
I
thought
very
much
of
little
Em
`
ly
,
and
her
*NL*
emotion
last
night
,
after
Martha
had
left
.
I
felt
as
if
I
had
come
into
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
those
domestic
weaknesses
and
tendernesses
in
a
sacred
*NL*
confidence
,
and
that
to
disclose
them
,
even
to
Steerforth
,
would
be
*NL*
wrong
.
I
had
no
gentler
feeling
towards
any
one
than
towards
the
pretty
*NL*
creature
who
had
been
my
playmate
,
and
whom
I
have
always
been
*NL*
persuaded
,
and
shall
always
be
persuaded
,
to
my
dying
day
,
I
then
*NL*
devotedly
loved
.
The
repetition
to
any
ears
--
even
to
Steerforth
's
--
of
*NL*
what
she
had
been
unable
to
repress
when
her
heart
lay
open
to
me
by
an
*NL*
accident
,
I
felt
would
be
a
rough
deed
,
unworthy
of
myself
,
unworthy
of
*NL*
the
light
of
our
pure
childhood
,
which
I
always
saw
encircling
her
head
.
*NL*
I
made
a
resolution
,
therefore
,
to
keep
it
in
my
own
breast
;
and
there
*NL*
it
gave
her
image
a
new
grace
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
at
breakfast
,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
me
from
my
aunt
.
*NL*
As
it
contained
matter
on
which
I
thought
Steerforth
could
advise
me
as
*NL*
well
as
any
one
,
and
on
which
I
knew
I
should
be
delighted
to
consult
*NL*
him
,
I
resolved
to
make
it
a
subject
of
discussion
on
our
journey
home
.
*NL*
For
the
present
we
had
enough
to
do
,
in
taking
leave
of
all
our
friends
.
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
was
far
from
being
the
last
among
them
,
in
his
regret
at
our
*NL*
departure
;
and
I
believe
would
even
have
opened
the
box
again
,
and
*NL*
sacrificed
another
guinea
,
if
it
would
have
kept
us
eight-and-forty
*NL*
hours
in
Yarmouth
.
Peggotty
,
and
all
her
family
,
were
full
of
grief
at
*NL*
our
going
.
The
whole
house
of
Omer
and
Joram
turned
out
to
bid
us
good
*NL*
bye
;
and
there
were
so
many
seafaring
volunteers
in
attendance
on
*NL*
Steerforth
,
when
our
portmanteaus
went
to
the
coach
,
that
if
we
had
had
*NL*
the
baggage
of
a
regiment
with
us
,
we
should
hardly
have
wanted
porters
*NL*
to
carry
it
.
In
a
word
,
we
departed
to
the
regret
and
admiration
of
all
*NL*
concerned
,
and
left
a
great
many
people
very
sorry
behind
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
stay
long
here
,
Littimer
?
''
said
I
,
as
he
stood
waiting
to
see
*NL*
the
coach
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
;
``
probably
not
very
long
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
hardly
say
just
now
,
''
observed
Steerforth
,
carelessly
.
``
He
knows
*NL*
what
he
has
to
do
,
and
he
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
sure
he
will
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Littimer
touched
his
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
my
good
opinion
,
and
I
*NL*
felt
about
eight
years
old
.
He
touched
it
once
more
,
wishing
us
a
good
*NL*
journey
;
and
we
left
him
standing
on
the
pavement
,
as
respectable
a
*NL*
mystery
as
any
pyramid
in
Egypt
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
little
time
we
held
no
conversation
,
Steerforth
being
unusually
*NL*
silent
,
and
I
being
sufficiently
engaged
in
wondering
,
within
myself
,
*NL*
when
I
should
see
the
old
places
again
,
and
what
new
changes
might
*NL*
happen
to
me
or
them
in
the
meanwhile
.
At
length
Steerforth
,
becoming
*NL*
gay
and
talkative
in
a
moment
,
as
he
could
become
anything
he
liked
at
*NL*
any
moment
,
pulled
me
by
the
arm
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
a
voice
,
David
.
What
about
the
letter
you
were
speaking
of
at
*NL*
breakfast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
I
,
taking
it
out
of
my
pocket
.
``
It
's
from
my
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
she
say
,
requiring
consideration
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
reminds
me
,
Steerforth
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
came
out
on
this
*NL*
expedition
to
look
about
me
,
and
to
think
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
,
of
course
,
you
have
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
ca
n't
say
I
have

particularly

To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
I
had
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
look
about
you
now
,
and
make
up
for
your
negligence

said
*NL*
Steerforth
.
``
Look

the
right
,
and
you
'll
see
a
flat
country
,
with
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
marsh
in
it
;
look
to
the
left
,
and
you
'll
see
the
same
.
*NL*
Look
to
the
front
,
and
you
'll
find
no
difference
;
look
to
the
rear
,
and
*NL*
there
it
is
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughed
,
and
replied
that
I
saw
no
suitable
profession
in
the
whole
*NL*
prospect
;
which
was
perhaps
to
be
attributed
to
its
flatness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
our
aunt
on
the
subject
?
''
inquired
Steerforth
,
glancing
at
*NL*
the
letter
in
my
hand
.
``
Does
she
suggest
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
said
I.
``
She
asks
me
,
here
,
if
I
think
I
should
like
to
be
a
*NL*
proctor
?
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
Steerforth
,
coolly
.
``
You
may
as
well
do
*NL*
that
as
anything
else
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
laughing
again
,
at
his
balancing
all
callings
and
*NL*
professions
so
equally
;
and
I
told
him
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
is
_
a
proctor
,
Steerforth
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
is
a
sort
of
monkish
attorney
,
''
replied
Steerforth
.
``
He
is
,
*NL*
to
some
faded
courts
held
in
Doctors
'
Commons
--
a
lazy
old
nook
near
*NL*
St.
Paul
's
Churchyard
--
what
solicitors
are
to
the
courts
of
law
and
*NL*
equity
.
He
is
a
functionary
whose
existence
,
in
the
natural
course
of
*NL*
things
,
would
have
terminated
about
two
hundred
years
ago
.
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
best
what
he
is
,
by
telling
you
what
Doctors
'
Commons
is
.
It
's
*NL*
a
little
out-of-the-way
place
,
where
they
administer
what
is
called
*NL*
ecclesiastical
law
,
and
play
all
kinds
of
tricks
with
obsolete
old
*NL*
monsters
of
acts
of
Parliament
,
which
three-fourths
of
the
world
know
*NL*
nothing
about
,
and
the
other
fourth
supposes
to
have
been
dug
up
,
in
*NL*
a
fossil
state
,
in
the
days
of
the
Edwards
.
It
's
a
place
that
has
an
*NL*
ancient
monopoly
in
suits
about
people
's
wills
and
people
's
marriages
,
*NL*
and
disputes
among
ships
and
boats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
Steerforth
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
there
*NL*
is
any
affinity
between
nautical
matters
and
ecclesiastical
matters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
,
indeed
,
my
dear
boy

''
he
returned
;
``
but
I
mean
to
say
that
*NL*
they
are
managed
and
decided
by
the
same
set
of
people

down
in
that
*NL*
same
Doctors

Commons
.
You
shall
go
there
one
day
,
and
find
them
*NL*
blundering
through
half
the
nautical
terms
in
Young
's
Dictionary
,
*NL*
apropos
of
the
`
Nancy
'
having
run
down
the
`
Sarah
Jane
,

or
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
and
the

having
put
off

to
the
`
Nelson

Indiaman
in
distress

you
shall
go
there
*NL*
another

find
them
deep
in
the
evidence

pro

con
,
respecting
*NL*
a
clergyman
who
has
misbehaved
himself

and
you
shall
find
the
judge
in
*NL*
the
nautical
case

the
advocate
in
the

case

contrariwise
.
*NL*
They
are
like
actors
:
now
a
man
's
a
judge
,
and
now
he
is
not
a
judge
;
*NL*
now
he
's
one
thing
,
now
he
's
another
;
now
he
's
something
else
,
change
*NL*
and
change
about
;
but
it
's
always
a
very
pleasant
profitable
little
*NL*
affair
of
private
theatricals
,
presented
to
an
uncommonly
select
*NL*
audience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
advocates
and
proctors
are
not
one
and
the
same
?
''
said
I
,
a
little
*NL*
puzzled
.
``
Are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Steerforth
,
``
the
advocates
are
civilians
--
men
who
have
*NL*
taken
a
doctor

degree
at

--
which
is
the
first
reason
of
my
*NL*
knowing
anything
about
it
.
The
proctors
employ
the
advocates
.
Both
get
*NL*
very
comfortable
fees
,
and
altogether
they
make
a
mighty
snug
little
*NL*
party
.
On
the
whole
,
I
would
recommend
you
to
take
to
Doctors

*NL*
kindly

David

They
plume
themselves
on
their
gentility
there
,
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
,
if
that
's
any
satisfaction

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
allowance
for
Steerforth
's
light
way
of
treating
the
subject
,
*NL*
and
,
considering
it
with
reference
to
the
staid
air
of
gravity
and
*NL*
antiquity
which
I
associated
with
that
``
lazy
old
nook
near
St.
Paul
's
*NL*
Churchyard
,
''
did
not
feel
indisposed
towards
my
aunt
's
suggestion
;
which
*NL*
she
left
to
my
free
decision
,
making
no
scruple
of
telling
me
that
it
*NL*
had
occurred
to
her
,
on
her
lately
visiting
her
own
proctor
in
Doctors
'
*NL*
Commons
for
the
purpose
of
settling
her
will
in
my
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
laudable
proceeding
on
the
part
of
our
aunt
,
at
all
events
,
''
*NL*
said
Steerforth
,
when
I
mentioned
it
;
``
and
one
deserving
of
all
*NL*
encouragement
.
Daisy
,
my
advice
is
that
you
take
kindly
to
Doctors

*NL*
Commons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
do
so
.
I
then
told
Steerforth
that
my
aunt
*NL*
was
in
town
awaiting
me
-LRB-
as
I
found
from
her
letter
-RRB-
,
and
that
she
had
*NL*
taken
lodgings
for
a
week
at
a
kind
of
private
hotel
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
*NL*
Fields
,
where
there
was
a
stone
staircase
,
and
a
convenient
door
in
the
*NL*
roof
;
my
aunt
being
firmly
persuaded
that
every
house
in
London
was
*NL*
going
to
be
burnt
down
every
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
achieved
the
rest
of
our
journey
pleasantly
,
sometimes
recurring
to
*NL*
Doctors
'
Commons
,
and
anticipating
the
distant
days
when
I
should
be
a
*NL*
proctor
there
,
which
Steerforth
pictured
in
a
variety
of
humorous
and
*NL*
whimsical
lights
,
that
made
us
both
merry
.
When
we
came
to
our
journey
's
*NL*
end
,
he
went
home
,
engaging
to
call
upon
me
next
day
but
one
;
and
I
*NL*
drove
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
where
I
found
my
aunt
up
,
and
waiting
*NL*
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
been
round
the
world
since
we
parted
,
we
could
hardly
have
been
*NL*
better
pleased
to
meet
again
.
My
aunt
cried
outright
as
she
embraced
me
;
*NL*
and
said
,
pretending
to
laugh
,
that
if
my
poor
mother
had
been
alive
,
*NL*
that
silly
little
creature
would
have
shed
tears
,
she
had
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
left
Mr.
Dick
behind
,
aunt
?
''
said
I.
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
*NL*
Ah
,
Janet
,
how
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Janet
curtsied
,
hoping
I
was
well
,
I
observed
my
aunt
's
visage
*NL*
lengthen
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
too
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
.
``
I
have
had
no
*NL*
peace
of
mind
,
Trot
,
since
I
have
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
could
ask
why
,
she
told
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
convinced
,
''
said
my
aunt
;
laying
her
hand
with
melancholy
firmness
*NL*
on
the
table
,
``
that
Dick
's
character
is
not
a
character
to
keep
the
*NL*
donkies
off
.
I
am
confident
he
wants
strength
of
purpose
.
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
left
Janet
at
home
,
instead
,
and
then
my
mind
might
perhaps
have
*NL*
been
at
ease
.
If
ever
there
was
a
donkey
trespassing
on
my
green
,
''
said
*NL*
my
aunt
,
with
emphasis
,
``
there
was
one
this
afternoon
at
four
o'clock
.
A
*NL*
cold
feeling
came
over
me
from
head
to
foot
,
and
I
_
know
_
it
was
a
*NL*
donkey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
comfort
her
on
this
point
,
but
she
rejected
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
donkey
,
''
said
my
aunt
;
``
and
it
was
the
one
with
the
stumpy
*NL*
tail
which
that
Murdering
sister
of
a
woman
rode
,
when
she
came
to
my
*NL*
house
.
''
This
had
been
,
ever
since
,
the
only
name
my
aunt
knew
for
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
.
``
If
there
is
any
donkey
in
Dover
,
whose
audacity
it
is
harder
*NL*
to
me
to
bear
than
another
's
,
that
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
striking
the
table
,
*NL*
``
is
the
animal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Janet
ventured
to
suggest
that
my
aunt
might
be
disturbing
herself
*NL*
unnecessarily
,
and
that
she
believed
the
donkey
in
question
was
then
*NL*
engaged
in
the
sand
and
gravel
line
of
business
,
and
was
not
available
*NL*
for
purposes
of
trespass
.
But
my
aunt
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
was
comfortably
served
and
hot
,
though
my
aunt
's
rooms
were
very
*NL*
high
up
--
whether
that
she
might
have
more
stone
stairs
for
her
money
,
or
*NL*
might
be
nearer
to
the
door
in
the
roof
,
I
do
n't
know
--
and
consisted
of
*NL*
a
roast
fowl
,
a
steak
,
and
some
vegetables
,
to
all
of
which
I
did
ample
*NL*
justice
,
and
which
were
all
excellent
.
But
my
aunt
had
her
own
ideas
*NL*
concerning
London
provision
,
and
ate
but
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
this
unfortunate
fowl
was
born
and
brought
up
in
a
cellar
,
''
*NL*
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
never
took
the
air
except
on
a
hackney
coach-stand
.
I
*NL*
_
hope
_
the
steak
may
be
beef
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
Nothing
's
genuine
*NL*
in
the
place
,
in
my
opinion
,
but
the
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
the
fowl
may
have
come
out
of
the
country
,
aunt
?
''
I
*NL*
hinted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
returned
my
aunt
.
``
It
would
be
no
pleasure
to
a
London
*NL*
tradesman
to
sell
anything
which
was
what
he
pretended
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
venture
to
controvert
this
opinion
,
but
I
made
a
good
supper
,
*NL*
which
it
greatly
satisfied
her
to
see
me
do
.
When
the
table
was
cleared
,
*NL*
Janet
assisted
her
to
arrange
her
hair
,
to
put
on
her
nightcap
,
which
*NL*
was
of
a
smarter
construction
than
usual
-LRB-
``

case
of
fire

my
aunt
*NL*
said
-RRB-

to
fold
her
gown
back
over
her
knees
,
these
being
her
usual
*NL*
preparations
for
warming
herself
before
going
to

I
then
made
her
,
*NL*
according
to
certain
established
regulations
from
which
no
deviation
,
*NL*
however
slight
,
could
ever
be
permitted
,
a
glass
of
hot
white
wine
and
*NL*
water
,
and
a
slice
of
toast
cut
into
long
thin
strips
.
With
these
*NL*
accompaniments
we
were
left
alone
to
finish
the
evening
,
my
aunt
sitting
*NL*
opposite
to
me
drinking
her
wine
and
water
;
soaking
her
strips
of
toast
*NL*
in
it
,
one
by
one
,
before
eating
them
;
and
looking
benignantly
on
me
,
*NL*
from
among
the
borders
of
her
nightcap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

she
began
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

cost

returned
my

just
a

*NL*
``
Now

said
I
,
drawing
my
chair
nearer
,
``
I
am
uneasy
in
my
*NL*
mind

that

It
's
a
large
sum
of
money

You
have
expended
a
great
*NL*
deal
on
my
education
,
and
have
always
been
as
liberal
to
me
in
all
*NL*
things
,
as
it
was
possible
to
be
.
You
have
been
the
soul
of
generosity
.
*NL*
Surely
there
are
some
ways
in
which
I
might
begin
life
with
hardly
any
*NL*
outlay
,
and
yet
begin
with
a
good
hope
of
getting
on
by
resolution
and
*NL*
exertion
.
Are
you
sure
that
it
would
not
be
better
to
try
that
course
?
*NL*
Are
you
certain
that
you
can
afford
to
part
with
so
much
money
,
and
that
*NL*
it
is
right
it
should
be
so
expended
?
I
only
ask
you
,
my
second
mother
,
*NL*
to
consider
.
Are
you
certain

*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
finished
eating
the
piece
of
toast
on
which
she
was
then
*NL*
engaged
,
looking
me
full
in
the
face
all
the
while
;
and
then
setting
her
*NL*
glass
on
the
chimney-piece
,
and
folding
her
hands
upon
her
folded
*NL*
skirts
,
replied
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot

my
child

if
I
have
any
object
in
life

it
is
to
provide
for
your

good

a
sensible

a
happy
man

I
am
bent

I
should
like
some
people

conversation

Its
sagacity
is
wonderful

She
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
my
hand
between
hers
,
and
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
vain
,
Trot
,
to
recall
the
past
,
unless
it
works
some
influence
*NL*
upon
the
present

Perhaps
I
might
have
been
better
friends
with
your
*NL*
poor
father

Perhaps
I
might
have
been
better
friends
with
that
poor

child
your
mother

even
after
your

Betsey
Trotwood
disappointed
*NL*
me
.
When
you
came
to
me
,
a
little
runaway
boy
,
all
dusty
and
wayworn
,
*NL*
perhaps
I
thought
so

From
that
time
until
now
,
Trot
,
you
have
ever
been
*NL*
a
credit
to
me

a
pride

no
other
claim
upon
my
*NL*
means

at

here
to
my
surprise
she
hesitated
,
and
was
*NL*
confused
--
``
no

Only
be
a

bear
with
my

you
will
do
more
for
an
old
woman
whose
prime
of
*NL*
life
was
not
so
happy

conciliating
as
it
might
have
been

ever
*NL*
that
old

did
for

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
heard
my
aunt
refer
to
her
past
history
.
*NL*
There
was
a
magnanimity
in
her
quiet
way
of
doing
so
,
and
of
dismissing
*NL*
it
,
which
would
have
exalted
her
in
my
respect
and
affection
,
if
any
*NL*
thing
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
agreed
and
understood
between
us
now
,
Trot

''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
*NL*
we
need
talk
of
this
no
more

Give
me
a
kiss
,
and
we
'll
go
to
the
*NL*
Commons
after
breakfast
to-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
long
chat
by
the
fire
before
we
went
to
bed
.
I
slept
in
a
room
*NL*
on
the
same
floor
with
my
aunt
's
,
and
was
a
little
disturbed
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
night
by
her
knocking
at
my
door
,
as
often
as
she
was
*NL*
agitated
by
a
distant
sound
of
hackney-coaches
or
market-carts
,
and
*NL*
inquiring
``
if
I
heard
the
engines
?
''
But
towards
morning
she
slept
*NL*
better
,
and
suffered
me
to
do
so
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
mid-day
,
we
set
out
for
the
offices
of
Messrs.
Spenlow
and
*NL*
Jorkins
in
Doctors
'
Commons
.
My
aunt
,
who
had
this
other
general
opinion
*NL*
in
reference
to
London
,
that
every
man
she
saw
was
a
pickpocket
,
gave
me
*NL*
her
purse
to
carry
for
her
,
which
had
ten
guineas
in
it
and
some
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
a
pause
at
the
toy-shop
in
Fleet-street
,
to
see
the
giants
of
*NL*
Saint
Dunstan
's
strike
upon
the
bells
--
we
had
timed
our
going
,
so
as
to
*NL*
catch
them
at
it
,
at
twelve
o'clock
--
and
then
went
on
towards
Ludgate
*NL*
Hill
,
and
St.
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
We
were
crossing
to
the
former
place
,
*NL*
when
I
found
that
my
aunt
greatly
accelerated
her
speed
,
and
looked
*NL*
frightened
.
I
observed
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
a
lowering
ill-dressed
*NL*
man
who
had
stopped
and
stared
at
us
in
passing
,
a
little
before
,
was
*NL*
coming
so
close
after
us
,
as
to
brush
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
!
My
dear
Trot
!
''
cried
my
aunt
,
in
a
terrified
whisper
,
and
*NL*
pressing
my
arm
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
''
said
I.
``
There
's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
.
Step
into
*NL*
a
shop
,
and
I
'll
soon
get
rid
of
this
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
child
!
''
she
returned
.
``
Do
n't
speak
to
him
for
the
world
.
I
*NL*
entreat
,
I
order
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heaven
,
aunt
!
''
said
I.
``
He
is
nothing
but
a
sturdy
beggar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
he

replied
my
aunt
.
``
You

n't
know
who
he
is
!
*NL*
You
do
n't
know
what
you
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
stopped
in
an
empty
doorway
,
while
this
was
passing
,
and
he
had
*NL*
stopped
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
look
at
him
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
as
I
turned
my
head
indignantly
,
``
but
*NL*
get
me
a
coach
,
my
dear
,
and
wait
for
me
in
St.
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
you
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
rejoined
my
aunt
,
``
I
must
go
alone
.
I
must
go
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
him
,

?
This
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
my
senses
,
''
she
replied
,
``
and
I
tell
you
I
_
must
_
.
Get
me
a
*NL*
coach
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
much
astonished
I
might
be
,
I
was
sensible
that
I
had
no
right
*NL*
to
refuse
compliance
with
such
a
peremptory
command
.
I
hurried
away
a
*NL*
few
paces
,
and
called
a
hackney
chariot
which
was
passing
empty
.
Almost
*NL*
before
I
could
let
down
the
steps
,
my
aunt
sprang
in
,
I
do
n't
know
how
,
*NL*
and
the
man
followed
.
She
waved
her
hand
to
me
to
go
away
,
so
earnestly
,
*NL*
that
,
all
confounded
as
I
was
,
I
turned
from
them
at
once
.
In
doing
so
I
*NL*
heard
her
say
to
the
coachman
,
``
Drive
anywhere
!
Drive
straight
on
!
''
and
*NL*
presently
the
chariot
passed
me
,
going
up
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Mr.
Dick
had
told
me
,
and
what
I
had
supposed
to
be
a
delusion
of
*NL*
his
,
now
came
into
my
mind
.
I
could
not
doubt
that
this
person
was
the
*NL*
person
of
whom
he
had
made
such
mysterious
mention
,
though
what
the
*NL*
nature
of
his
hold
upon
my
aunt
could
possibly
be
,
I
was
quite
unable
to
*NL*
imagine
.
After
half
an
hour
's
cooling
in
the
churchyard
,
I
saw
the
*NL*
chariot
coming
back
.
The
driver
stopped
beside
me
,
and
my
aunt
was
*NL*
sitting
in
it
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
from
her
agitation
to
be
quite
*NL*
prepared
for
the
visit
we
had
to
make
.
She
desired
me
to
get
into
the
*NL*
chariot
,
and
to
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
slowly
up
and
down
a
little
*NL*
while
.
She
said
no
more
,
except
,
``
My
dear
child
,
never
ask
me
what
it
*NL*
was
,
and
do
n't
refer
to
it
,
''
until
she
had
perfectly
regained
her
*NL*
composure
,
when
she
told
me
she
was
quite
herself
now
,
and
we
might
get
*NL*
out
.
On
her
giving
me
her
purse
,
to
pay
the
driver
,
I
found
that
all
the
*NL*
guineas
were
gone
,
and
only
the
loose
silver
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctors
'
Commons
was
approached
by
a
little
low
archway
.
Before
we
had
*NL*
taken
many
paces
down
the
street
beyond
it
,
the
noise
of
the
city
seemed
*NL*
to
melt
,
as
if
by
magic
,
into
a
softened
distance
.
A
few
dull
courts
,
*NL*
and
narrow
ways
,
brought
us
to
the
sky-lighted
offices
of
Spenlow
and
*NL*
Jorkins
;
in
the
vestibule
of
which
temple
,
accessible
to
pilgrims
*NL*
without
the
ceremony
of
knocking
,
three
or
four
clerks
were
at
work
as
*NL*
copyists
.
One
of
these
,
a
little
dry
man
,
sitting
by
himself
,
who
wore
a
*NL*
stiff
brown
wig
that
looked
as
if
it
were
made
of
gingerbread
,
rose
to
*NL*
receive
my
aunt
,
and
show
us
into
Mr.
Spenlow
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Spenlow
's
in
Court
,
ma'am
,
''
said
the
dry
man
;
``
it
's
an
Arches
day
;
*NL*
but
it
's
close
by
,
and
I
'll
send
for
him
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
left
to
look
about
us
while
Mr.
Spenlow
was
fetched
,
I
*NL*
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
.
The
furniture
of
the
room
was
*NL*
old-fashioned
and
dusty
;
and
the
green
baize
on
the
top
of
the
*NL*
writing-table
had
lost
all
its
color
,
and
was
as
withered
and
pale
as
*NL*
an
old
pauper
.
There
were
a
great
many
bundles
of
papers
on
it
,
some
*NL*
indorsed
as
Allegations
,
and
some
-LRB-
to
my
surprise
-RRB-
as
Libels
,
and
*NL*
some
as
being
in
the
Consistory
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Arches
Court
,
*NL*
and
some
in
the
Prerogative
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Admiralty
Court
,
*NL*
and
some
in
the
Delegates
'
Court
;
giving
me
occasion
to
wonder
much
,
*NL*
how
many
Courts
there
might
be
in
the
gross
,
and
how
long
it
would
*NL*
take
to
understand
them
all
.
Besides
these
,
there
were
sundry
immense
*NL*
manuscript
Books
of
Evidence
taken
on
affidavit
,
strongly
bound
,
and
*NL*
tied
together
in
massive
sets
,
a
set
to
each
cause
,
as
if
every
cause
*NL*
were
a
history
in
ten
or
twenty
volumes
.
All
this
looked
tolerably
*NL*
expensive
,
I
thought
,
and
gave
me
an
agreeable
notion
of
a
proctor
's
*NL*
business
.
I
was
casting
my
eyes
with
increasing
complacency
over
these
*NL*
and
many
similar
objects
,
when
hasty
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
room
*NL*
outside
,
and
Mr.
Spenlow
,
in
a
black
gown
trimmed
with
white
fur
,
came
*NL*
hurrying
in
,
taking
off
his
hat
as
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
little
light-haired
gentleman
,
with
undeniable
boots
,
and
the
*NL*
stiffest
of
white
cravats
and
shirt-collars
.
He
was
buttoned
up
,
mighty
*NL*
trim
and
tight
,
and
must
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
his
*NL*
whiskers
,
which
were
accurately
curled
.
His
gold
watch-chain
was
so
*NL*
massive
,
that
a
fancy
came
across
me
,
that
he
ought
to
have
a
sinewy
*NL*
golden
arm
,
to
draw
it
out
with
,
like
those
which
are
put
up
over
the
*NL*
gold-beaters
'
shops
.
He
was
got
up
with
such
care
,
and
was
so
stiff
,
*NL*
that
he
could
hardly
bend
himself
;
being
obliged
,
when
he
glanced
at
*NL*
some
papers
on
his
desk
,
after
sitting
down
in
his
chair
,
to
move
his
*NL*
whole
body
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
spine
,
like
Punch
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
previously
been
presented
by
my
aunt
,
and
had
been
courteously
*NL*
received
.
He
now
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
you
think
of
entering
into
our
profession
?
*NL*
I
casually
mentioned
to
Miss
Trotwood
,
when
I
had
the
pleasure
of
an
*NL*
interview
with
her
the
other
day
,
''
--
with
another
inclination
of
his
*NL*
body
--
Punch
again
--
``
that
there
was
a
vacancy
here
.
Miss
Trotwood
was
*NL*
good
enough
to
mention
that
she
had
a
nephew
who
was
her
peculiar
care
,
*NL*
and
for
whom
she
was
seeking
to
provide
genteelly
in
life
.
That
nephew
,
*NL*
I
believe
,
I
have
now
the
pleasure
of

Punch
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
bowed
my
acknowledgments
,
and
said
,
my
aunt
had
mentioned
to
me
that
*NL*
there
was
that
opening
,
and
that
I
believed
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
*NL*
That
I
was
strongly
inclined
to
like
it
,
and
had
taken
immediately
to
*NL*
the
proposal
.
That
I
could
not
absolutely
pledge
myself
to
like
it
,
*NL*
until
I
knew
something
more
about
it
.
That
although
it
was
little
else
*NL*
than
a
matter
of
form
,
I
presumed
I
should
have
an
opportunity
of
trying
*NL*
how
I
liked
it
,
before
I
bound
myself
to
it
irrevocably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
surely
!
surely
!
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
``
We
always
,
in
this
house

*NL*
propose
a
month

an
initiatory
month

I
should
be
happy
,
myself

to
*NL*
propose
two
months

three

an
indefinite
period

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
returned

``
And
the

said
Mr.

Spenlow

``
As
I
have
mentioned
to

Trotwood

less
so

I
believe
;

Mr.
*NL*
Jorkins
has
his
opinions
on
these
subjects

I
am
bound
to
respect

Mr.
Jorkins

opinions

Mr.
Jorkins
thinks
a
thousand
pounds
too
little

*NL*
in
short

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose

said
I
,
still
desiring
to
spare
my
aunt
,
``
that
it
is
*NL*
not
the
custom
here
,
if
an
articled
clerk
were
particularly
useful

made
himself
a
perfect
master
of
his
profession

I
could
not
help
*NL*
blushing
,
this
looked
so
like
praising
myself

``

suppose

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
,
by
a
great
effort
,
just
lifted
his
head
far
enough
out
of
*NL*
his
cravat
to
shake
it
,
and
answered
,
anticipating
the
word
``

*NL*

``
No

not

immovable

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
quite
dismayed
by
the
idea

terrible
Jorkins
.
But
I
found
*NL*
out
afterwards
that
he
was
a
mild
man

of
a
heavy
temperament
,
whose
*NL*
place
in
the
business
was
to
keep
himself
in
the
back-ground
,
and
be
*NL*
constantly
exhibited
by
name
as
the
most
obdurate
and
ruthless
of
men
.
*NL*
If
a
clerk
wanted
his
salary
raised
,
Mr.
Jorkins
would
n't
listen
to
such
*NL*
a
proposition
.
If
a
client
were
slow
to
settle
his
bill
of
costs
,
Mr.
*NL*
Jorkins
was
resolved
to
have
it
paid
;
and
however
painful
these
things
*NL*
might
be
-LRB-
and
always
were
-RRB-
to
the
feelings
of
Mr.
Spenlow
,
Mr.
Jorkins
*NL*
would
have
his
bond
.
The
heart
and
hand
of
the
good
angel
Spenlow
would
*NL*
have
been
always
open
,
but
for
the
restraining
demon
Jorkins
.
As
I
have
*NL*
grown
older
,
I
think
I
have
had
experience
of
some
other
houses
doing
*NL*
business
on
the
principle
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
settled
that
I
should
begin
my
month
's
probation
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
pleased
,
and
that
my
aunt
need
neither
remain
in
town
nor
return
at
its
*NL*
expiration
,
as
the
articles
of
agreement
,
of
which
I
was
to
be
the
*NL*
subject
,
could
easily
be
sent
to
her
at
home
for
her
signature
.
When
we
*NL*
had
got
so
far
,
Mr.
Spenlow
offered
to
take
me
into
Court
then
and
*NL*
there
,
and
show
me
what
sort
of
place
it
was
.
As
I
was
willing
enough
to
*NL*
know
,
we
went
out
with
this
object
,
leaving
my
aunt
behind
;
who
would
*NL*
trust
herself
,
she
said
,
in
no
such
place
,
and
who
,
I
think
,
regarded
*NL*
all
Courts
of
Law
as
a
sort
of
powder-mills
that
might
blow
up
at
any
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
conducted
me
through
a
paved
courtyard
formed
of
grave
*NL*
brick
houses
,
which
I
inferred
,
from
the
Doctors
'
names
upon
the
*NL*
doors
,
to
be
the
official
abiding-places
of
the
learned
advocates
of
*NL*
whom
Steerforth
had
told
me
;
and
into
a
large
dull
room
,
not
unlike
*NL*
a
chapel
to
my
thinking
,
on
the
left
hand
.
The
upper
part
of
this
*NL*
room
was
fenced
off
from
the
rest
;
and
there
,
on
the
two
sides
of
a
*NL*
raised
platform
of
the
horse-shoe
form
,
sitting
on
easy
old-fashioned
*NL*
dining-room
chairs
,
were
sundry
gentlemen
in
red
gowns
and
grey
wigs
,
*NL*
whom
I
found
to
be
the
Doctors
aforesaid
.
Blinking
over
a
little
*NL*
desk
like
a
pulpit-desk
,
in
the
curve
of
the
horse-shoe
,
was
an
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
whom
,
if
I
had
seen
him
in
an
aviary
,
I
should
certainly
*NL*
have
taken
for
an
owl
,
but
who
I
learned
was
the
presiding
judge
.
In
*NL*
the
space
within
the
horse-shoe
,
lower
than
these
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
on
about
the
level
of
the
floor
,
were
sundry
other
gentlemen
,
of
Mr.
*NL*
Spenlow
's
rank
,
and
dressed
like
him
in
black
gowns
with
white
fur
upon
*NL*
them
,
sitting
at
a
long
green
table
.
Their
cravats
were
in
general
*NL*
stiff
,
I
thought
,
and
their
looks
haughty
;
but
in
this
last
respect
I
*NL*
presently
conceived
I
had
done
them
an
injustice
,
for
when
two
or
three
*NL*
of
them
had
to
rise
and
answer
a
question
of
the
presiding
dignitary
,
*NL*
I
never
saw
anything
more
sheepish
.
The
public
,
represented
by
a
boy
*NL*
with
a
comforter
,
and
a
shabby-genteel
man
secretly
eating
crumbs
out
*NL*
of
his
coat
pockets
,
was
warming
itself
at
a
stove
in
the
centre
of
*NL*
the
Court
.
The
languid
stillness
of
the
place
was
only
broken
by
the
*NL*
chirping
of
this
fire
and
by
the
voice
of
one
of
the
Doctors
,
who
was
*NL*
wandering
slowly
through
a
perfect
library
of
evidence
,
and
stopping
to
*NL*
put
up
,
from
time
to
time
,
at
little
roadside
inns
of
argument
on
the
*NL*
journey
.
Altogether
,
I
have
never
,
on
any
occasion
,
made
one
at
such
*NL*
a
cosey
,
dosey
,
old-fashioned
,
time-forgotten
,
sleepy-headed
little
*NL*
family-party
in
all
my
life
;
and
I
felt
it
would
be
quite
a
soothing
*NL*
opiate
to
belong
to
it
in
any
character
--
except
perhaps
as
a
suitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
well
satisfied
with
the
dreamy
nature
of
this
retreat
,
I
informed
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
that
I
had
seen
enough
for
that
time
,
and
we
rejoined
my
*NL*
aunt
;
in
company
with
whom
I
presently
departed
from
the
Commons
,
*NL*
feeling
very
young
when
I
went
out
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
's
,
on
account
*NL*
of
the
clerks
poking
one
another
with
their
pens
to
point
me
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
arrived
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
without
any
new
adventures
,
except
*NL*
encountering
an
unlucky
donkey
in
a
costermonger
's
cart
,
who
suggested
*NL*
painful
associations
to
my
aunt
.
We
had
another
long
talk
about
my
*NL*
plans
,
when
we
were
safely
housed
;
and
as
I
knew
she
was
anxious
to
get
*NL*
home
,
and
,
between
fire
,
food
,
and
pickpockets
,
could
never
be
*NL*
considered
at
her
ease
for
half-an-hour
in
London
,
I
urged
her
not
to
be
*NL*
uncomfortable
on
my
account
,
but
to
leave
me
to
take
care
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
been
here
a
week
to-morrow
,
without
considering
that
too
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
''
she
returned
.
``
There
is
a
furnished
little
set
of
chambers
to
be
*NL*
let
in
the
Adelphi
,
Trot
,
which
ought
to
suit
you
to
a
marvel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
brief
introduction
,
she
produced
from
her
pocket
an
*NL*
advertisement
,
carefully
cut
out
of
a
newspaper
,
setting
forth
that
in
*NL*
Buckingham
Street
in
the
Adelphi
there
was
to
be
let
,
furnished
,
with
a
*NL*
view
of
the
river
,
a
singularly
desirable
,
and
compact
set
of
chambers
,
*NL*
forming
a
genteel
residence
for
a
young
gentleman
,
a
member
of
one
of
*NL*
the
Inns
of
Court
,
or
otherwise
,
with
immediate
possession
.
Terms
*NL*
moderate
,
and
could
be
taken
for
a
month
only
if
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
is
the
very
thing
,
aunt
!
''
said
I
,
flushed
with
the
possible
*NL*
dignity
of
living
in
chambers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
come
,
''
replied
my
aunt
,
immediately
resuming
the
bonnet
she
had
a
*NL*
minute
before
laid
aside
.
``
We
'll
go
and
look
at
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Away
we
went
.
The
advertisement
directed
us
to
apply
to
Mrs.
Crupp
on
*NL*
the
premises
,
and
we
rung
the
area
bell
,
which
we
supposed
to
*NL*
communicate
with
Mrs.
Crupp
.
It
was
not
until
we
had
rung
three
or
four
*NL*
times
that
we
could
prevail
on
Mrs.
Crupp
to
communicate
with
us
,
but
at
*NL*
last
she
appeared
,
being
a
stout
lady
with
a
flounce
of
flannel
*NL*
petticoat
below
a
nankeen
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
these
chambers
of
yours
,
if
you
please
,
ma'am
,
''
said
my
*NL*
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this
gentleman
?
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
feeling
in
her
pocket
for
her
*NL*
keys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
for
my
nephew
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
sweet
set
they
is
for
sich
!
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
went
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
on
the
top
of
the
house
--
a
great
point
with
my
aunt
,
being
*NL*
near
the
fire-escape
--
and
consisted
of
a
little
half-blind
entry
where
*NL*
you
could
see
hardly
anything
,
a
little
stone-blind
pantry
where
you
*NL*
could
see
nothing
at
all
,
a
sitting-room
,
and
a
bed-room
.
The
furniture
*NL*
was
rather
faded
,
but
quite
good
enough
for
me
;
and
,
sure
enough
,
the
*NL*
river
was
outside
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
delighted
with
the
place
,
my
aunt
and
Mrs.
Crupp
withdrew
into
*NL*
the
pantry
to
discuss
the
terms
,
while
I
remained
on
the
sitting-room
*NL*
sofa
,
hardly
daring
to
think
it
possible
that
I
could
be
destined
to
*NL*
live
in
such
a
noble
residence
.
After
a
single
combat
of
some
duration
*NL*
they
returned
,
and
I
saw
,
to
my
joy
,
both
in
Mrs.
Crupp
's
countenance
*NL*
and
in
my
aunt
's
,
that
the
deed
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
last
occupant
's
furniture
?
''
inquired
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
is
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
become
of
him
?
''
asked
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
was
taken
with
a
troublesome
cough
,
in
the
midst
of
which
*NL*
she
articulated
with
much
difficulty
.
``
He
was
took
ill
here
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
and
--
ugh
!
ugh
!
ugh
!
dear
me
!
--
and
he
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
What
did
he
die
of
?
''
asked
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
he
died
of
drink
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
in
confidence
.
``
And
*NL*
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smoke
?
You
do
n't
mean
chimneys
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Crupp
.
``
Cigars
and
pipes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
's
_
not
catching
,
Trot
,
at
any
rate
,
''
remarked
my
aunt
,
turning
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
my
aunt
,
seeing
how
enraptured
I
was
with
the
premises
,
took
*NL*
them
for
a
month
,
with
leave
to
remain
for
twelve
months
when
that
time
*NL*
was
out
.
Mrs.
Crupp
was
to
find
linen
,
and
to
cook
;
every
other
*NL*
necessary
was
already
provided
;
and
Mrs.
Crupp
expressly
intimated
that
*NL*
she
should
always
yearn
towards
me
as
a
son
.
I
was
to
take
possession
*NL*
the
day
after
to-morrow
,
and
Mrs.
Crupp
said
thank
Heaven
she
had
now
*NL*
found
summun
she
could
care
for
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
way
back
,
my
aunt
informed
me
how
she
confidently
trusted
that
*NL*
the
life
I
was
now
to
lead
would
make
me
firm
and
self-reliant
,
which
*NL*
was
all
I
wanted
.
She
repeated
this
several
times
next
day
,
in
the
*NL*
intervals
of
our
arranging
for
the
transmission
of
my
clothes
and
books
*NL*
from
Mr.
Wickfield
's
;
relative
to
which
,
and
to
all
my
late
holiday
,
I
*NL*
wrote
a
long
letter
to
Agnes
,
of
which
my
aunt
took
charge
,
as
she
was
*NL*
to
leave
on
the
succeeding
day
.
Not
to
lengthen
these
particulars
,
I
*NL*
need
only
add
,
that
she
made
a
handsome
provision
for
all
my
possible
*NL*
wants
during
my
month
of
trial
;
that
Steerforth
,
to
my
great
*NL*
disappointment
and
hers
too
,
did
not
make
his
appearance
before
she
went
*NL*
away
;
that
I
saw
her
safely
seated
in
the
Dover
coach
,
exulting
in
the
*NL*
coming
discomfiture
of
the
vagrant
donkeys
,
with
Janet
at
her
side
;
and
*NL*
that
when
the
coach
was
gone
,
I
turned
my
face
to
the
Adelphi
,
pondering
*NL*
on
the
old
days
when
I
used
to
roam
about
its
subterranean
arches
,
and
*NL*
on
the
happy
changes
which
had
brought
me
to
the
surface
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
MY
FIRST
DISSIPATION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
have
that
lofty
castle
to
myself
,
and
*NL*
to
feel
,
when
I
shut
my
outer
door
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
,
when
he
had
*NL*
got
into
his
fortification
,
and
pulled
his
ladder
up
after
him
.
It
was
a
*NL*
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
walk
about
town
with
the
key
of
my
house
in
my
*NL*
pocket
,
and
to
know
that
I
could
ask
any
fellow
to
come
home
,
and
make
*NL*
quite
sure
of
its
being
inconvenient
to
nobody
,
if
it
were
not
so
to
me
.
*NL*
It
was
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
let
myself
in
and
out
,
and
to
come
*NL*
and
go
without
a
word
to
any
one
,
and
to
ring
Mrs.
Crupp
up
,
gasping
,
*NL*
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
,
when
I
wanted
her
--
and
when
she
was
*NL*
disposed
to
come
.
All
this
,
I
say
,
was
wonderfully
fine
;
but
I
must
say
,
*NL*
too
,
that
there
were
times
when
it
was
very
dreary
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fine
in
the
morning
,
particularly
in
the
fine
mornings
.
It
looked
*NL*
a
very
fresh
,
free
life
,
by
daylight
:
still
fresher
,
and
more
free
,
by
*NL*
sunlight
.
But
as
the
day
declined
,
the
life
seemed
to
go
down
too
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
it
was
;
it
seldom
looked
well
by
candle-light
.
I
wanted
*NL*
somebody
to
talk
to
,
then
.
I
missed
Agnes
.
I
found
a
tremendous
blank
,
*NL*
in
the
place
of
that
smiling
repository
of
my
confidence
.
Mrs.
Crupp
*NL*
appeared
to
be
a
long
way
off
.
I
thought
about
my
predecessor
,
who
had
*NL*
died
of
drink
and
smoke
;
and
I
could
have
wished
he
had
been
so
good
as
*NL*
to
live
,
and
not
bother
me
with
his
decease
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
days
and
nights
,
I
felt
as
if
I
had
lived
there
for
a
year
,
*NL*
and
yet
I
was
not
an
hour
older
,
but
was
quite
as
much
tormented
by
my
*NL*
own
youthfulness
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steerforth
not
yet
appearing
,
which
induced
me
to
apprehend
that
he
must
*NL*
be
ill
,
I
left
the
Commons
early
on
the
third
day
,
and
walked
out
to
*NL*
Highgate
.
Mrs.
Steerforth
was
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
said
that
he
had
*NL*
gone
away
with
one
of
his
Oxford
friends
to
see
another
who
lived
near
*NL*
St.
Albans
,
but
that
she
expected
him
to
return
to-morrow
.
I
was
so
fond
*NL*
of
him
,
that
I
felt
quite
jealous
of
his
Oxford
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
pressed
me
to
stay
to
dinner
,
I
remained
,
and
I
believe
we
talked
*NL*
about
nothing
but
him
all
day
.
I
told
her
how
much
the
people
liked
him
*NL*
at
Yarmouth
,
and
what
a
delightful
companion
he
had
been
.
Miss
Dartle
*NL*
was
full
of
hints
and
mysterious
questions
,
but
took
a
great
interest
in
*NL*
all
our
proceedings
there
,
and
said
,
``
Was
it
really
,
though
?
''
and
so
*NL*
forth
,
so
often
,
that
she
got
everything
out
of
me
she
wanted
to
know
.
*NL*
Her
appearance
was
exactly
what
I
have
described
it
,
when
I
first
saw
*NL*
her
;
but
the
society
of
the
two
ladies
was
so
agreeable
,
and
came
so
*NL*
natural
to
me
,
that
I
felt
myself
falling
a
little
in
love
with
her
.
I
*NL*
could
not
help
thinking
,
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
*NL*
particularly
when
I
walked
home
at
night
,
what
delightful
company
she
*NL*
would
be
in
Buckingham
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
taking
my
coffee
and
roll
in
the
morning
,
before
going
to
the
*NL*
Commons
--
and
I
may
observe
in
this
place
that
it
is
surprising
how
much
*NL*
coffee
Mrs.
Crupp
used
,
and
how
weak
it
was
,
considering
--
when
*NL*
Steerforth
himself
walked
in
,
to
my
unbounded
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Steerforth
,
''
cried
I
,
``
I
began
to
think
I
should
never
see
you
*NL*
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
carried
off
,
by
force
of
arms
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
``
the
very
next
*NL*
morning
after
I
got
home
.
Why
,
Daisy
,
what
a
rare
old
bachelor
you
are
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
showed
him
over
the
establishment
,
not
omitting
the
pantry
,
with
no
*NL*
little
pride
,
and
he
commended
it
highly
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
old
boy
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
I
shall
make
quite
a
town-house
of
this
place
,
unless
you
give
*NL*
me
notice
to
quit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
delightful
hearing
.
I
told
him
if
he
waited
for
that
,
he
*NL*
would
have
to
wait
till
doomsday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
shall
have
some
breakfast
!
''
said
I
,
with
my
hand
on
the
*NL*
bell-rope
,
``
and
Mrs.
Crupp
shall
make
you
some
fresh
coffee
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
toast
you
some
bacon
in
a
bachelor
's
Dutch-oven
that
I
have
got
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Do
n't
ring
!
I
ca
n't
!
I
am
going
to
breakfast
*NL*
with
one
of
these
fellows
who
is
at
the
Piazza
Hotel
,
in
Covent
Garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
come
back
to
dinner
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
,
upon
my
life
.
There
's
nothing
I
should
like
better
,
but
I
*NL*
_
must
_
remain
with
these
two
fellows
.
We
are
all
three
off
together
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
bring
them
here
to
dinner
,
''
I
returned
.
``
Do
you
think
they
would
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
they
would
come
fast
enough
,
''
said
Steerforth
;
``
but
we
should
*NL*
inconvenience
you
.
You
had
better
come
and
dine
with
us
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
by
any
means
consent
to
this
,
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
*NL*
really
ought
to
have
a
little
housewarming
,
and
that
there
never
could
*NL*
be
a
better
opportunity
.
I
had
a
new
pride
in
my
rooms
after
his
*NL*
approval
of
them
,
and
burned
with
a
desire
to
develop
their
utmost
*NL*
resources
.
I
therefore
made
him
promise
positively
in
the
names
of
his
*NL*
two
friends
,
and
we
appointed
six
o'clock
as
the
dinner-hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
,
I
rang
for
Mrs.
Crupp
,
and
acquainted
her
with
my
*NL*
desperate
design
.
Mrs.
Crupp
said
,
in
the
first
place
,
of
course
it
*NL*
was
well
known
she
could
n't
be
expected
to
wait
,
but
she
knew
a
handy
*NL*
young
man
,
who
she
thought
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
do
it
,
and
whose
*NL*
terms
would
be
five
shillings
,
and
what
I
pleased
.
I
said
,
certainly
we
*NL*
would
have
him
.
Next
,
Mrs.
Crupp
said
it
was
clear
she
could
n't
be
in
*NL*
two
places
at
once
-LRB-
which
I
felt
to
be
reasonable
-RRB-
,
and
that
``
a
young
*NL*
gal
''
stationed
in
the
pantry
with
a
bed-room
candle
,
there
never
to
*NL*
desist
from
washing
plates
,
would
be
indispensable
.
I
said
,
what
would
*NL*
be
the
expense
of
this
young
female
,
and
Mrs.
Crupp
said
she
supposed
*NL*
eighteen-pence
would
neither
make
me
nor
break
me
.
I
said
I
supposed
*NL*
not
;
and
_
that
_
was
settled
.
Then
Mrs.
Crupp
said
,
Now
about
the
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
remarkable
instance
of
want
of
forethought
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
ironmonger
who
had
made
Mrs.
Crupp
's
kitchen
fire-place
,
that
it
*NL*
was
capable
of
cooking
nothing
but
chops
and
mashed
potatoes
.
As
to
a
*NL*
fish-kittle
,
Mrs.
Crupp
said
,
well
!
would
I
only
come
and
look
at
the
*NL*
range
.
She
could
n't
say
fairer
than
that
.
Would
I
come
and
look
at
it
?
*NL*
As
I
should
not
have
been
much
the
wiser
if
I
_
had
_
looked
at
it
,
I
*NL*
declined
,
and
said
,
``
Never
mind
fish
.
''
But
Mrs.
Crupp
said
,
Do
n't
say
*NL*
that
;
oysters
was
in
,
and
why
not
them
?
So
_
that
_
was
settled
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Crupp
then
said
what
she
would
recommend
would
be
this
.
A
pair
of
*NL*
hot
roast
fowls
--
from
the
pastry-cook
's
;
a
dish
of
stewed
beef
,
with
*NL*
vegetables
--
from
the
pastry-cook
's
;
two
little
corner
things
,
as
a
*NL*
raised
pie
and
a
dish
of
kidneys
--
from
the
pastry-cook
's
;
a
tart
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
if
I
liked
-RRB-
a
shape
of
jelly
--
from
the
pastry-cook
's
.
This
,
Mrs.
Crupp
*NL*
said
,
would
leave
her
at
full
liberty
to
concentrate
her
mind
on
the
*NL*
potatoes
,
and
to
serve
up
the
cheese
and
celery
as
she
could
wish
to
*NL*
see
it
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
acted
on
Mrs.
Crupp
's
opinion
,
and
gave
the
order
at
the
pastry-cook
's
*NL*
myself
.
Walking
along
the
Strand
,
afterwards
,
and
observing
a
hard
*NL*
mottled
substance
in
the
window
of
a
ham
and
beef
shop
,
which
resembled
*NL*
marble
,
but
was
labelled
``
Mock
Turtle
,
''
I
went
in
and
bought
a
slab
of
*NL*
it
,
which
I
have
since
seen
reason
to
believe
would
have
sufficed
for
*NL*
fifteen
people
.
This
preparation
,
Mrs.
Crupp
,
after
some
difficulty
,
*NL*
consented
to
warm
up
;
and
it
shrunk
so
much
in
a
liquid
state
,
that
we
*NL*
found
it
what
Steerforth
called
``
rather
a
tight
fit
''
for
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
preparations
happily
completed
,
I
bought
a
little
dessert
in
*NL*
Covent
Garden
Market
,
and
gave
a
rather
extensive
order
at
a
retail
*NL*
wine-merchant
's
in
that
vicinity
.
When
I
came
home
in
the
afternoon
,
and
*NL*
saw
the
bottles
drawn
up
in
a
square
on
the
pantry-floor
,
they
looked
so
*NL*
numerous
-LRB-
though
there
were
two
missing
,
which
made
Mrs.
Crupp
very
*NL*
uncomfortable
-RRB-
,
that
I
was
absolutely
frightened
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
Steerforth
's
friends
was
named
Grainger
,
and
the
other
Markham
.
*NL*
They
were
both
very
gay
and
lively
fellows
;
Grainger
,
something
older
*NL*
than
Steerforth
;
Markham
,
youthful-looking
,
and
I
should
say
not
more
*NL*
than
twenty
.
I
observed
that
the
latter
always
spoke
of
himself
*NL*
indefinitely
,
as
``
a
man
,
''
and
seldom
or
never
in
the
first
person
*NL*
singular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
might
get
on
very
well
here
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
*NL*
Markham
--
meaning
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
bad
situation
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
the
rooms
are
really
*NL*
commodious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
have
both
brought
appetites
with
you
?
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honour
,
''
returned
Markham
,
``
town
seems
to
sharpen
a
man
's
*NL*
appetite
.
A
man
is
hungry
all
day
long
.
A
man
is
perpetually
eating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
,
and
feeling
much
too
young
to
*NL*
preside
,
I
made
Steerforth
take
the
head
of
the
table
when
dinner
was
*NL*
announced
,
and
seated
myself
opposite
to
him
.
Everything
was
very
good
;
*NL*
we
did
not
spare
the
wine
;
and
he
exerted
himself
so
brilliantly
to
make
*NL*
the
thing
pass
off
well
,
that
there
was
no
pause
in
our
festivity
.
I
was
*NL*
not
quite
such
good
company
during
dinner
,
as
I
could
have
wished
to
be
,
*NL*
for
my
chair
was
opposite
the
door
,
and
my
attention
was
distracted
by
*NL*
observing
that
the
handy
young
man
went
out
of
the
room
very
often
,
and
*NL*
that
his
shadow
always
presented
itself
,
immediately
afterwards
,
on
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
entry
,
with
a
bottle
at
its
mouth
.
The
``
young
gal
''
likewise
*NL*
occasioned
me
some
uneasiness
:
not
so
much
by
neglecting
to
wash
the
*NL*
plates
,
as
by
breaking
them
.
For
being
of
an
inquisitive
disposition
,
*NL*
and
unable
to
confine
herself
-LRB-
as
her
positive
instructions
were
-RRB-
to
the
*NL*
pantry
,
she
was
constantly
peering
in
at
us
,
and
constantly
imagining
*NL*
herself
detected
;
in
which
belief
,
she
several
times
retired
upon
the
*NL*
plates
-LRB-
with
which
she
had
carefully
paved
the
floor
-RRB-
,
and
did
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
however
,
were
small
drawbacks
,
and
easily
forgotten
when
the
*NL*
cloth
was
cleared
,
and
the
dessert
put
on
the
table
;
at
which
period
of
*NL*
the
entertainment
the
handy
young
man
was
discovered
to
be
speechless
.
*NL*
Giving
him
private
directions
to
seek
the
society
of
Mrs.
Crupp
,
and
to
*NL*
remove
the
``
young
gal
''
to
the
basement
also
,
I
abandoned
myself
to
*NL*
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
,
by
being
singularly
cheerful
and
light-hearted
;
all
sorts
of
*NL*
half-forgotten
things
to
talk
about
,
came
rushing
into
my
mind
,
and
made
*NL*
me
hold
forth
in
a
most
unwonted
manner
.
I
laughed
heartily
at
my
own
*NL*
jokes
,
and
everybody
else
's
;
called
Steerforth
to
order
for
not
passing
*NL*
the
wine
;
made
several
engagements
to
go
to
Oxford
;
announced
that
I
*NL*
meant
to
have
a
dinner
party
exactly
like
that
,
once
a
week
until
*NL*
further
notice
;
and
madly
took
so
much
snuff
out
of
Grainger
's
box
,
that
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
go
into
the
pantry
,
and
have
a
private
fit
of
sneezing
*NL*
ten
minutes
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
on
,
by
passing
the
wine
faster
and
faster
yet
,
and
continually
*NL*
starting
up
with
a
corkscrew
to
open
more
wine
,
long
before
any
was
*NL*
needed
.
I
proposed
Steerforth
's
health
.
I
said
he
was
my
dearest
*NL*
friend
,
the
protector
of
my
boyhood
,
and
the
companion
of
my
prime
.
*NL*
I
said
I
was
delighted
to
propose
his
health
.
I
said
I
owed
him
*NL*
more
obligations
than
I
could
ever
repay
,
and
held
him
in
a
higher
*NL*
admiration
than
I
could
ever
express
.
I
finished
by
saying
,
``
I
'll
give
*NL*
you
Steerforth
!
God
bless
him
!
Hurrah
!
''
We
gave
him
three
times
three
,
*NL*
and
another
,
and
a
good
one
to
finish
with
.
I
broke
my
glass
in
going
*NL*
round
the
table
to
shake
hands
with
him
,
and
I
said
-LRB-
in
two
words
-RRB-
*NL*
``
Steerforthyou
`
retheguidingstarofmyexist
ence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
on
,
by
finding
suddenly
that
somebody
was
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
song
.
Markham
was
the
singer
,
and
he
sang
``
When
the
heart
of
a
man
is
*NL*
depressed
with
care
.
''
He
said
,
when
he
had
sung
it
,
he
would
give
us
*NL*
``
Woman
!
''
I
took
objection
to
that
,
and
I
could
n't
allow
it
.
I
said
it
*NL*
was
not
a
respectful
way
of
proposing
the
toast
,
and
I
would
never
*NL*
permit
that
toast
to
be
drunk
in
my
house
otherwise
than
as
``
The
*NL*
Ladies
!
''
I
was
very
high
with
him
,
mainly
I
think
because
I
saw
*NL*
Steerforth
and
Grainger
laughing
at
me
--
or
at
him
--
or
at
both
of
us
.
He
*NL*
said
a
man
was
not
to
be
dictated
to
.
I
said
a
man
_
was
_
.
He
said
a
man
*NL*
was
not
to
be
insulted
,
then
.
I
said
he
was
right
there
--
never
under
my
*NL*
roof
,
where
the
Lares
were
sacred
,
and
the
laws
of
hospitality
*NL*
paramount
.
He
said
it
was
no
derogation
from
a
man
's
dignity
to
confess
*NL*
that
I
was
a
devilish
good
fellow
.
I
instantly
proposed
his
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
was
smoking
.
We
were
all
smoking
.
_
I
_
was
smoking
,
and
trying
*NL*
to
suppress
a
rising
tendency
to
shudder
.
Steerforth
had
made
a
speech
*NL*
about
me
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
had
been
affected
almost
to
tears
.
*NL*
I
returned
thanks
,
and
hoped
the
present
company
would
dine
with
me
*NL*
to-morrow
,
and
the
day
after
--
each
day
at
five
o'clock
,
that
we
might
*NL*
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
conversation
and
society
through
a
long
evening
.
*NL*
I
felt
called
upon
to
propose
an
individual
.
I
would
give
them
my
aunt
.
*NL*
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
the
best
of
her
sex
!
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
was
leaning
out
of
my
bed-room
window
,
refreshing
his
forehead
*NL*
against
the
cool
stone
of
the
parapet
,
and
feeling
the
air
upon
his
*NL*
face
.
It
was
myself
.
I
was
addressing
myself
as
``
Copperfield
,
''
and
*NL*
saying
,
``
Why
did
you
try
to
smoke
?
You
might
have
known
you
could
n't
*NL*
do
it
.
''
Now
,
somebody
was
unsteadily
contemplating
his
features
in
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
That
was
I
too
.
I
was
very
pale
in
the
looking-glass
;
*NL*
my
eyes
had
a
vacant
appearance
;
and
my
hair
--
only
my
hair
,
nothing
*NL*
else
--
looked
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
said
to
me
,
``
Let
us
go
to
the
theatre
,
Copperfield
!
''
There
was
*NL*
no
bed-room
before
me
,
but
again
the
jingling
table
covered
with
*NL*
glasses
;
the
lamp
;
Grainger
on
my
right
hand
,
Markham
on
my
left
,
and
*NL*
Steerforth
opposite
--
all
sitting
in
a
mist
,
and
a
long
way
off
.
The
*NL*
theatre
?
To
be
sure
.
The
very
thing
.
Come
along
!
But
they
must
excuse
me
*NL*
if
I
saw
everybody
out
first
,
and
turned
the
lamp
off
--
in
case
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
some
confusion
in
the
dark
,
the
door
was
gone
.
I
was
feeling
*NL*
for
it
in
the
window-curtains
,
when
Steerforth
,
laughing
,
took
me
by
the
*NL*
arm
and
led
me
out
.
We
went
down-stairs
,
one
behind
another
.
Near
the
*NL*
bottom
,
somebody
fell
,
and
rolled
down
.
Somebody
else
said
it
was
*NL*
Copperfield
.
I
was
angry
at
that
false
report
,
until
,
finding
myself
on
*NL*
my
back
in
the
passage
,
I
began
to
think
there
might
be
some
foundation
*NL*
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
foggy
night
,
with
great
rings
round
the
lamps
in
the
streets
!
*NL*
There
was
an
indistinct
talk
of
its
being
wet
.
_
I
_
considered
it
frosty
.
*NL*
Steerforth
dusted
me
under
a
lamp-post
,
and
put
my
hat
into
shape
,
which
*NL*
somebody
produced
from
somewhere
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
for
I
*NL*
had
n't
had
it
on
before
.
Steerforth
then
said
,
``
You
are
all
right
,
*NL*
Copperfield
,
are
you
not
?
''
and
I
told
him
,
``
Neverberrer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
,
sitting
in
a
pigeon-hole-place
,
looked
out
of
the
fog
,
and
took
*NL*
money
from
somebody
,
inquiring
if
I
was
one
of
the
gentlemen
paid
for
,
*NL*
and
appearing
rather
doubtful
-LRB-
as
I
remember
in
the
glimpse
I
had
of
*NL*
him
-RRB-
whether
to
take
the
money
for
me
or
not
.
Shortly
afterwards
,
we
*NL*
were
very
high
up
in
a
very
hot
theatre
,
looking
down
into
a
large
pit
,
*NL*
that
seemed
to
me
to
smoke
;
the
people
with
whom
it
was
crammed
were
so
*NL*
indistinct
.
There
was
a
great
stage
,
too
,
looking
very
clean
and
smooth
*NL*
after
the
streets
;
and
there
were
people
upon
it
,
talking
about
*NL*
something
or
other
,
but
not
at
all
intelligibly
.
There
was
an
abundance
*NL*
of
bright
lights
,
and
there
was
music
,
and
there
were
ladies
down
in
the
*NL*
boxes
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
more
.
The
whole
building
looked
to
me
,
as
*NL*
if
it
were
learning
to
swim
;
it
conducted
itself
in
such
an
*NL*
unaccountable
manner
,
when
I
tried
to
steady
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
somebody
's
motion
,
we
resolved
to
go
down-stairs
to
the
dress-boxes
,
*NL*
where
the
ladies
were
.
A
gentleman
lounging
,
full
dressed
,
on
a
sofa
,
*NL*
with
an
opera-glass
in
his
hand
,
passed
before
my
view
,
and
also
my
own
*NL*
figure
at
full
length
in
a
glass
.
Then
I
was
being
ushered
into
one
of
*NL*
these
boxes
,
and
found
myself
saying
something
as
I
sat
down
,
and
people
*NL*
about
me
crying
``
Silence
!
''
to
somebody
,
and
ladies
casting
indignant
*NL*
glances
at
me
,
and
--
what
!
yes
!
--
Agnes
,
sitting
on
the
seat
before
me
,
in
*NL*
the
same
box
,
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
beside
her
,
whom
I
did
n't
know
.
*NL*
I
see
her
face
now
,
better
than
I
did
then
I
dare
say
,
with
its
*NL*
indelible
look
of
regret
and
wonder
turned
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
!
''
I
said
,
thickly
,
``
Lorblessmer
!
Agnes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
Pray
!
''
she
answered
,
I
could
not
conceive
why
.
``
You
disturb
the
*NL*
company
.
Look
at
the
stage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
,
on
her
injunction
,
to
fix
it
,
and
to
hear
something
of
what
was
*NL*
going
on
there
,
but
quite
in
vain
.
I
looked
at
her
again
by-and-by
,
and
*NL*
saw
her
shrink
into
her
corner
,
and
put
her
gloved
hand
to
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
!
''
I
said
.
``
I
`
mafraidyou
`
renorwell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
Do
not
mind
me
,
Trotwood
,
''
she
returned
.
``
Listen
!
Are
you
*NL*
going
away
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amigoarawaysoo
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
stupid
intention
of
replying
that
I
was
going
to
wait
,
to
hand
*NL*
her
down-stairs
.
I
suppose
I
expressed
it
,
somehow
;
for
after
she
had
*NL*
looked
at
me
attentively
for
a
little
while
,
she
appeared
to
understand
,
*NL*
and
replied
in
a
low
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
will
do
as
I
ask
you
,
if
I
tell
you
I
am
very
earnest
in
it
.
*NL*
Go
away
now
,
Trotwood
,
for
my
sake
,
and
ask
your
friends
to
take
you
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
so
far
improved
me
,
for
the
time
,
that
though
I
was
angry
with
*NL*
her
,
I
felt
ashamed
,
and
with
a
short
``
Goori
!
''
-LRB-
which
I
intended
for
*NL*
``
Good
night
!
''
-RRB-
got
up
and
went
away
.
They
followed
,
and
I
stepped
at
*NL*
once
out
of
the
box-door
into
my
bedroom
,
where
only
Steerforth
was
with
*NL*
me
,
helping
me
to
undress
,
and
where
I
was
by
turns
telling
him
that
*NL*
Agnes
was
my
sister
,
and
adjuring
him
to
bring
the
corkscrew
,
that
I
*NL*
might
open
another
bottle
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
somebody
,
lying
in
my
bed
,
lay
saying
and
doing
all
this
over
again
,
*NL*
at
cross
purposes
,
in
a
feverish
dream
all
night
--
the
bed
a
rocking
sea
*NL*
that
was
never
still
!
How
,
as
that
somebody
slowly
settled
down
into
*NL*
myself
,
did
I
begin
to
parch
,
and
feel
as
if
my
outer
covering
of
skin
*NL*
were
a
hard
board
;
my
tongue
the
bottom
of
an
empty
kettle
,
furred
with
*NL*
long
service
,
and
burning
up
over
a
slow
fire
;
the
palms
of
my
hands
,
*NL*
hot
plates
of
metal
which
no
ice
could
cool
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
agony
of
mind
,
the
remorse
,
and
shame
I
felt
,
when
I
became
*NL*
conscious
next
day
!
My
horror
of
having
committed
a
thousand
offences
*NL*
I
had
forgotten
,
and
which
nothing
could
ever
expiate
--
my
recollection
*NL*
of
that
indelible
look
which
Agnes
had
given
me
--
the
torturing
*NL*
impossibility
of
communicating
with
her
,
not
knowing
,
Beast
that
I
*NL*
was
,
how
she
came
to
be
in
London
,
or
where
she
stayed
--
my
disgust
of
*NL*
the
very
sight
of
the
room
where
the
revel
had
been
held
--
my
racking
*NL*
head
--
the
smell
of
smoke
,
the
sight
of
glasses
,
the
impossibility
of
*NL*
going
out
,
or
even
getting
up
!
Oh
,
what
a
day
it
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
what
an
evening
,
when
I
sat
down
by
my
fire
to
a
basin
of
mutton
*NL*
broth
,
dimpled
all
over
with
fat
,
and
thought
I
was
going
the
way
of
*NL*
my
predecessor
,
and
should
succeed
to
his
dismal
story
as
well
as
*NL*
to
his
chambers
,
and
had
half
a
mind
to
rush
express
to
Dover
and
*NL*
reveal
all
!
What
an
evening
,
when
Mrs.
Crupp
,
coming
in
to
take
away
*NL*
the
broth-basin
,
produced
one
kidney
on
a
cheese-plate
as
the
entire
*NL*
remains
of
yesterday
's
feast
,
and
I
was
really
inclined
to
fall
upon
*NL*
her
nankeen
breast
,
and
say
,
in
heartfelt
penitence
,
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Crupp
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
,
never
mind
the
broken
meats
!
I
am
very
miserable
!
''
--
only
*NL*
that
I
doubted
,
even
at
that
pass
,
if
Mrs.
Crupp
were
quite
the
sort
of
*NL*
woman
to
confide
in
!

CHAPTER
XXV
.
*NL*
*NL*
GOOD
AND
BAD
ANGELS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
out
at
my
door
on
the
morning
after
that
deplorable
day
of
*NL*
headache
,
sickness
,
and
repentance
,
with
an
odd
confusion
in
my
mind
*NL*
relative
to
the
date
of
my
dinner-party
,
as
if
a
body
of
Titans
had
*NL*
taken
an
enormous
lever
and
pushed
the
day
before
yesterday
some
months
*NL*
back
,
when
I
saw
a
ticket-porter
coming
up-stairs
,
with
a
letter
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
He
was
taking
his
time
about
his
errand
,
then
;
but
when
he
saw
me
*NL*
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
looking
at
him
over
the
bannisters
,
he
*NL*
swung
into
a
trot
,
and
came
up
panting
as
if
he
had
run
himself
into
a
*NL*
state
of
exhaustion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T.
Copperfield
,
Esquire
,
''
said
the
ticket-porter
,
touching
his
hat
with
*NL*
his
little
cane
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
scarcely
lay
claim
to
the
name
:
I
was
so
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
conviction
that
the
letter
came
from
Agnes
.
However
,
I
told
him
I
was
T.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
Esquire
,
and
he
believed
it
,
and
gave
me
the
letter
,
which
*NL*
he
said
required
an
answer
.
I
shut
him
out
on
the
landing
to
wait
for
*NL*
the
answer
,
and
went
into
my
chambers
again
,
in
such
a
nervous
state
*NL*
that
I
was
fain
to
lay
the
letter
down
on
my
breakfast-table
,
and
*NL*
familiarise
myself
with
the
outside
of
it
a
little
,
before
I
could
*NL*
resolve
to
break
the
seal
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
,
when
I
did
open
it
,
that
it
was
a
very
kind
note
,
containing
no
*NL*
reference
to
my
condition
at
the
theatre
.
All
it
said
,
was
,
``
My
dear
*NL*
Trotwood
.
I
am
staying
at
the
house
of
papa
's
agent
,
Mr.
Waterbrook
,
in
*NL*
Ely-place
,
Holborn
.
Will
you
come
and
see
me
to-day
,
at
any
time
you
*NL*
like
to
appoint
?
Ever
yours
affectionately
,
AGNES
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
me
such
a
long
time
to
write
an
answer
at
all
to
my
*NL*
satisfaction
,
that
I
do
n't
know
what
the
ticket-porter
can
have
thought
,
*NL*
unless
he
thought
I
was
learning
to
write
.
I
must
have
written
half
a
*NL*
dozen
answers
at
least
.
I
began
one
,
``
How
can
I
ever
hope
,
my
dear
*NL*
Agnes
,
to
efface
from
your
remembrance
the
disgusting
impression
''
--
there
*NL*
I
did
n't
like
it
,
and
then
I
tore
it
up
.
I
began
another
,
``
Shakspeare
*NL*
has
observed
,
my
dear
Agnes
,
how
strange
it
is
that
a
man
should
put
an
*NL*
enemy
into
his
mouth
''
--
that
reminded
me
of
Markham
,
and
it
got
no
*NL*
farther
.
I
even
tried
poetry
.
I
began
one
note
,
in
a
six-syllable
line
,
*NL*
``
Oh
do
not
remember
''
--
but
that
associated
itself
with
the
fifth
of
*NL*
November
,
and
became
an
absurdity
.
After
many
attempts
,
I
wrote
,
``
My
*NL*
dear
Agnes
.
Your
letter
is
like
you
,
and
what
could
I
say
of
it
that
*NL*
would
be
higher
praise
than
that
?
I
will
come
at
four
o'clock
.
*NL*
Affectionately
and
sorrowfully
,
T.
C.
''
With
this
missive
-LRB-
which
I
was
in
*NL*
twenty
minds
at
once
about
recalling
,
as
soon
as
it
was
out
of
my
*NL*
hands
-RRB-
,
the
ticket-porter
at
last
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
day
were
half
as
tremendous
to
any
other
professional
gentleman
*NL*
in
Doctors
'
Commons
as
it
was
to
me
,
I
sincerely
believe
he
made
some
*NL*
expiation
for
his
share
in
that
rotten
old
ecclesiastical
cheese
.
*NL*
Although
I
left
the
office
at
half-past
three
,
and
was
prowling
about
*NL*
the
place
of
appointment
within
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
the
appointed
*NL*
time
was
exceeded
by
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
,
according
to
the
*NL*
clock
of
St.
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
before
I
could
muster
up
sufficient
*NL*
desperation
to
pull
the
private
bell-handle
let
into
the
left-hand
*NL*
door-post
of
Mr.
Waterbrook
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
professional
business
of
Mr.
Waterbrook
's
establishment
was
done
on
*NL*
the
ground-floor
,
and
the
genteel
business
-LRB-
of
which
there
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
-RRB-
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
.
I
was
shown
into
a
pretty
but
*NL*
rather
close
drawing-room
,
and
there
sat
Agnes
,
netting
a
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
so
quiet
and
good
,
and
reminded
me
so
strongly
of
my
airy
*NL*
fresh
school
days
at
Canterbury
,
and
the
sodden
,
smoky
,
stupid
wretch
*NL*
I
had
been
the
other
night
,
that
,
nobody
being
by
,
I
yielded
to
my
*NL*
self-reproach
and
shame
,
and
--
in
short
,
made
a
fool
of
myself
.
I
can
not
*NL*
deny
that
I
shed
tears
.
To
this
hour
I
am
undecided
whether
it
was
upon
*NL*
the
whole
the
wisest
thing
I
could
have
done
,
or
the
most
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
been
any
one
but
you
,
Agnes
,
''
said
I
,
turning
away
my
head
,
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
minded
it
half
so
much
.
But
that
it
should
have
been
*NL*
you
who
saw
me
!
I
almost
wish
I
had
been
dead
,
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
--
its
touch
was
like
no
other
hand
--
upon
my
arm
for
a
*NL*
moment
;
and
I
felt
so
befriended
and
comforted
,
that
I
could
not
help
*NL*
moving
it
to
my
lips
,
and
gratefully
kissing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
said
Agnes
,
cheerfully
.
``
Do
n't
be
unhappy
,
Trotwood
.
If
you
*NL*
can
not
confidently
trust
me
,
whom
will
you
trust
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Agnes
!
''
I
returned
.
``
You
are
my
good
Angel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
rather
sadly
,
I
thought
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Agnes
,
my
good
Angel
!
Always
my
good
Angel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
,
indeed
,
Trotwood
,
''
she
returned
,
``
there
is
one
thing
that
I
*NL*
should
set
my
heart
on
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
her
inquiringly
;
but
already
with
a
foreknowledge
of
her
*NL*
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
warning
you
,
''
said
Agnes
,
with
a
steady
glance
,
``
against
your
bad
*NL*
Angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Agnes
,
''
I
began
,
``
if
you
mean
Steerforth
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
Trotwood
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Agnes
,
you
wrong
him
very
much
.
He
my
bad
Angel
,
or
anyone
's
!
He
,
*NL*
anything
but
a
guide
,
a
support
,
and
a
friend
to
me
!
My
dear
Agnes
!
Now
,
*NL*
is
it
not
unjust
,
and
unlike
you
,
to
judge
him
from
what
you
saw
of
me
*NL*
the
other
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
judge
him
from
what
I
saw
of
you
the
other
night
,
''
she
quietly
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
many
things
--
trifles
in
themselves
,
but
they
do
not
seem
to
me
to
*NL*
be
so
,
when
they
are
put
together
.
I
judge
him
,
partly
from
your
account
*NL*
of
him
,
Trotwood
,
and
your
character
,
and
the
influence
he
has
over
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
always
something
in
her
modest
voice
that
seemed
to
touch
a
*NL*
chord
within
me
,
answering
to
that
sound
alone
.
It
was
always
earnest
;
*NL*
but
when
it
was
very
earnest
,
as
it
was
now
,
there
was
a
thrill
in
it
*NL*
that
quite
subdued
me
.
I
sat
looking
at
her
as
she
cast
her
eyes
down
on
*NL*
her
work
;
I
sat
seeming
still
to
listen
to
her
;
and
Steerforth
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
my
attachment
to
him
,
darkened
in
that
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
bold
in
me
,
''
said
Agnes
,
looking
up
again
,
``
who
have
lived
*NL*
in
such
seclusion
,
and
can
know
so
little
of
the
world
,
to
give
you
my
*NL*
advice
so
confidently
,
or
even
to
have
this
strong
opinion
.
But
I
know
*NL*
in
what
it
is
engendered
,
Trotwood
,
--
in
how
true
a
remembrance
of
our
*NL*
having
grown
up
together
,
and
in
how
true
an
interest
in
all
relating
to
*NL*
you
.
It
is
that
which
makes
me
bold
.
I
am
certain
that
what
I
say
is
*NL*
right
.
I
am
quite
sure
it
is
.
I
feel
as
if
it
were
some
one
else
*NL*
speaking
to
you
,
and
not
I
,
when
I
caution
you
that
you
have
made
a
*NL*
dangerous
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
looked
at
her
,
again
I
listened
to
her
after
she
was
silent
,
and
*NL*
again
his
image
,
though
it
was
still
fixed
in
my
heart
,
darkened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
,
''
said
Agnes
,
resuming
her
usual
*NL*
tone
,
after
a
little
while
,
``
that
you
will
,
or
that
you
can
,
at
once
,
*NL*
change
any
sentiment
that
has
become
a
conviction
to
you
;
least
of
all
a
*NL*
sentiment
that
is
rooted
in
your
trusting
disposition
.
You
ought
not
*NL*
hastily
to
do
that
.
I
only
ask
you
,
Trotwood
,
if
you
ever
think
of
me
--
I
*NL*
mean
''
with
a
quiet
smile
,
for
I
was
going
to
interrupt
her
,
and
she
knew
*NL*
why
``
as
often
as
you
think
of
me
--
to
think
of
what
I
have
said
.
Do
you
*NL*
forgive
me
for
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
forgive
you
,
Agnes
,
''
I
replied
,
``
when
you
come
to
do
Steerforth
*NL*
justice
,
and
to
like
him
as
well
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
until
then
?
''
said
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
a
passing
shadow
on
her
face
when
I
made
this
mention
of
him
,
but
*NL*
she
returned
my
smile
,
and
we
were
again
as
unreserved
in
our
mutual
*NL*
confidence
as
of
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
,
Agnes
,
''
said
I
,
``
will
you
forgive
me
the
other
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
recall
it
,
''
said
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
dismissed
the
subject
so
,
but
I
was
too
full
of
it
to
*NL*
allow
that
,
and
insisted
on
telling
her
how
it
happened
that
I
had
*NL*
disgraced
myself
,
and
what
chain
of
accidental
circumstances
had
had
the
*NL*
theatre
for
its
final
link
.
It
was
a
great
relief
to
me
to
do
this
,
and
*NL*
to
enlarge
on
the
obligation
that
I
owed
to
Steerforth
for
his
care
of
*NL*
me
when
I
was
unable
to
take
care
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
forget
,
''
said
Agnes
,
calmly
changing
the
conversation
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
had
concluded
,
``
that
you
are
always
to
tell
me
,
not
only
when
*NL*
you
fall
into
trouble
,
but
when
you
fall
in
love
.
Who
has
succeeded
to
*NL*
Miss
Larkins
,
Trotwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
,
Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
,
Trotwood
,
''
said
Agnes
,
laughing
,
and
holding
up
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Agnes
,
upon
my
word
!
There
is
a
lady
,
certainly
,
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Steerforth
's
house
,
who
is
very
clever
,
and
whom
I
like
to
talk
to
--
Miss
*NL*
Dartle
--
but
I
do
n't
adore
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
laughed
again
at
her
own
penetration
,
and
told
me
that
if
I
were
*NL*
faithful
to
her
in
my
confidence
she
thought
she
should
keep
a
little
*NL*
register
of
my
violent
attachments
,
with
the
date
,
duration
,
and
*NL*
termination
of
each
,
like
the
table
of
the
reigns
of
the
kings
and
*NL*
queens
,
in
the
History
of
England
.
Then
she
asked
me
if
I
had
seen
*NL*
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uriah
Heep
?
''
said
I.
``
No
.
Is
he
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
comes
to
the
office
down-stairs
,
every
day
,
''
returned
Agnes
.
``
He
was
*NL*
in
London
a
week
before
me
.
I
am
afraid
on
disagreeable
business
,
*NL*
Trotwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
some
business
that
makes
you
uneasy
,
Agnes
,
I
see
,
''
said
I.
``
What
*NL*
can
that
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
laid
aside
her
work
,
and
replied
,
folding
her
hands
upon
one
*NL*
another
,
and
looking
pensively
at
me
out
of
those
beautiful
soft
eyes
of
*NL*
hers
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
he
is
going
to
enter
into
partnership
with
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Uriah
?
That
mean
,
fawning
fellow
,
worm
himself
into
such
*NL*
promotion
?
''
I
cried
,
indignantly
.
``
Have
you
made
no
remonstrance
about
*NL*
it
,
Agnes
?
Consider
what
a
connexion
it
is
likely
to
be
.
You
must
speak
*NL*
out
.
You
must
not
allow
your
father
to
take
such
a
mad
step
.
You
must
*NL*
prevent
it
,
Agnes
,
while
there
's
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
looking
at
me
,
Agnes
shook
her
head
while
I
was
speaking
,
with
a
*NL*
faint
smile
at
my
warmth
:
and
then
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
our
last
conversation
about
papa
?
It
was
not
long
after
*NL*
that
--
not
more
than
two
or
three
days
--
when
he
gave
me
the
first
*NL*
intimation
of
what
I
tell
you
.
It
was
sad
to
see
him
struggling
between
*NL*
his
desire
to
represent
it
to
me
as
a
matter
of
choice
on
his
part
,
and
*NL*
his
inability
to
conceal
that
it
was
forced
upon
him
.
I
felt
very
*NL*
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forced
upon
him
,
Agnes
!
Who
forces
it
upon
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uriah
,
''
she
replied
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
``
has
made
himself
*NL*
indispensable
to
papa
.
He
is
subtle
and
watchful
.
He
has
mastered
papa
's
*NL*
weaknesses
,
fostered
them
,
and
taken
advantage
of
them
,
until
--
to
say
*NL*
all
that
I
mean
in
a
word
,
Trotwood
,
until
papa
is
afraid
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
that
she
might
have
said
;
more
that
she
knew
,
or
that
she
*NL*
suspected
;
I
clearly
saw
.
I
could
not
give
her
pain
by
asking
what
it
*NL*
was
,
for
I
knew
that
she
withheld
it
from
me
,
to
spare
her
father
.
It
*NL*
had
long
been
going
on
to
this
,
I
was
sensible
:
yes
,
I
could
not
but
*NL*
feel
,
on
the
least
reflection
,
that
it
had
been
going
on
to
this
for
a
*NL*
long
time
.
I
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
ascendancy
over
papa
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
is
very
great
.
He
professes
*NL*
humility
and
gratitude
--
with
truth
,
perhaps
:
I
hope
so
--
but
his
position
*NL*
is
really
one
of
power
,
and
I
fear
he
makes
a
hard
use
of
his
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
he
was
a
hound
,
which
,
at
the
moment
,
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
time
I
speak
of
,
as
the
time
when
papa
spoke
to
me
,
''
pursued
*NL*
Agnes
,
``
he
had
told
papa
that
he
was
going
away
;
that
he
was
very
sorry
,
*NL*
and
unwilling
to
leave
,
but
that
he
had
better
prospects
.
Papa
was
very
*NL*
much
depressed
then
,
and
more
bowed
down
by
care
than
ever
you
or
I
have
*NL*
seen
him
;
but
he
seemed
relieved
by
this
expedient
of
the
partnership
,
*NL*
though
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
hurt
by
it
and
ashamed
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
you
receive
it
,
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
Trotwood

''
she
replied
,
``
what
I
hope
was
right

Feeling
sure
*NL*
that
it
was
necessary
for
papa
's
peace
that
the
sacrifice
should
be
*NL*
made
,
I
entreated
him
to
make
it
.
I
said
it
would
lighten
the
load
of
*NL*
his
life
--
I
hope
it
will
!
--
and
that
it
would
give
me
increased
*NL*
opportunities
of
being
his
companion
.
Oh
,
Trotwood
!
''
cried
Agnes
,
*NL*
putting
her
hands
before
her
face
,
as
her
tears
started
on
it
,
``
I
almost
*NL*
feel
as
if
I
had
been
papa
's
enemy
,
instead
of
his
loving
child

For
I
*NL*
know
how
he
has
altered
,
in
his
devotion
to
me
.
I
know
how
he
has
*NL*
narrowed
the
circle
of
his
sympathies
and
duties
,
in
the
concentration
*NL*
of
his
whole
mind
upon
me
.
I
know
what
a
multitude
of
things
he
has
shut
*NL*
out
for
my
sake
,
and
how
his
anxious
thoughts
of
me
have
shadowed
his
*NL*
life
,
and
weakened
his
strength
and
energy
,
by
turning
them
always
upon
*NL*
one
idea
.
If
I
could
ever
set
this
right
!
If
I
could
ever
work
out
his
*NL*
restoration
,
as
I
have
so
innocently
been
the
cause
of
his
decline

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
before
seen
Agnes
cry
.
I
had
seen
tears
in
her
eyes
when
I
*NL*
had
brought
new
honours
home
from
school
,
and
I
had
seen
them
there
when
*NL*
we
last
spoke
about
her
father
,
and
I
had
seen
her
turn
her
gentle
head
*NL*
aside
when
we
took
leave
of
one
another
;
but
I
had
never
seen
her
grieve
*NL*
like
this
.
It
made
me
so
sorry
that
I
could
only
say
,
in
a
foolish
,
*NL*
helpless
manner
,
``
Pray
,
Agnes
,
do
n't
!
Do
n't
,
my
dear
sister
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Agnes
was
too
superior
to
me
in
character
and
purpose
,
as
I
know
*NL*
well
now
,
whatever
I
might
know
or
not
know
then
,
to
be
long
in
need
of
*NL*
my
entreaties
.
The
beautiful
,
calm
manner
,
which
makes
her
so
different
*NL*
in
my
remembrance
from
everybody
else
,
came
back
again
,
as
if
a
cloud
*NL*
had
passed
from
a
serene
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
likely
to
remain
alone
much
longer
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
and
while
*NL*
I
have
an
opportunity

let
me
earnestly
entreat
you

to
be

friendly
to
Uriah

Do
n't
repel
him

Do

He

In

,
think
*NL*
first
of
papa
and
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
had
no
time
to
say
more
,
for
the
room-door
opened
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Waterbrook
,
who
was
a
large
lady
--
or
who
wore
a
large
dress
:
I
do
n't
*NL*
exactly
know
which
,
for
I
do
n't
know
which
was
dress
and
which
was
*NL*
lady
--
came
sailing
in
.
I
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
her
at
*NL*
the
theatre
,
as
if
I
had
seen
her
in
a
pale
magic
lantern
;
but
she
*NL*
appeared
to
remember
me
perfectly
,
and
still
to
suspect
me
of
being
in
*NL*
a
state
of
intoxication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
by
degrees
,
however
,
that
I
was
sober
,
and
-LRB-
I
hope
-RRB-
that
I
was
a
*NL*
modest
young
gentleman
,
Mrs.
Waterbrook
softened
towards
me
*NL*
considerably
,
and
inquired
,
firstly
,
if
I
went
much
into
the
parks
,
and
*NL*
secondly
,
if
I
went
much
into
society
.
On
my
replying
to
both
these
*NL*
questions
in
the
negative
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
fell
again
in
her
*NL*
good
opinion
;
but
she
concealed
the
fact
gracefully
,
and
invited
me
to
*NL*
dinner
next
day
.
I
accepted
the
invitation
,
and
took
my
leave
;
making
a
*NL*
call
on
Uriah
in
the
office
as
I
went
out
,
and
leaving
a
card
for
him
in
*NL*
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
went
to
dinner
next
day
,
and
,
on
the
street-door
being
opened
,
*NL*
plunged
into
a
vapour-bath
of
haunch
of
mutton
,
I
divined
that
I
was
not
*NL*
the
only
guest
;
for
I
immediately
identified
the
ticket-porter
in
*NL*
disguise
,
assisting
the
family
servant
,
and
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
stairs
to
carry
up
my
name
.
He
looked
,
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
when
*NL*
he
asked
me
for
it
confidentially
,
as
if
he
had
never
seen
me
before
;
*NL*
but
well
did
I
know
him
,
and
well
did
he
know
me
.
Conscience
made
*NL*
cowards
of
us
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Mr.
Waterbrook
to
be
a
middle-aged
gentleman
,
with
a
short
*NL*
throat
,
and
a
good
deal
of
shirt-collar
,
who
only
wanted
a
black
nose
to
*NL*
be
the
portrait
of
a
pug-dog
.
He
told
me
he
was
happy
to
have
the
honour
*NL*
of
making
my
acquaintance
;
and
when
I
had
paid
my
homage
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Waterbrook
,
presented
me
,
with
much
ceremony
,
to
a
very
awful
lady
in
a
*NL*
black
velvet
dress
,
and
a
great
black
velvet
hat
,
whom
I
remember
as
*NL*
looking
like
a
near
relation
of
Hamlet
's
--
say
his
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Henry
Spiker
was
this
lady
's
name
;
and
her
husband
was
there
too
:
*NL*
so
cold
a
man
,
that
his
head
,
instead
of
being
grey
,
seemed
to
be
*NL*
sprinkled
with
hoar-frost
.
Immense
deference
was
shown
to
the
Henry
*NL*
Spikers
,
male
and
female
;
which
Agnes
told
me
was
on
account
of
Mr.
*NL*
Henry
Spiker
being
solicitor
to
something
or
to
somebody
,
I
forget
what
*NL*
or
which
,
remotely
connected
with
the
Treasury
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Uriah
Heep
among
the
company
,
in
a
suit
of
black
,
and
in
deep
*NL*
humility
.
He
told
me
,
when
I
shook
hands
with
him
,
that
he
was
proud
to
*NL*
be
noticed
by
me
,
and
that
he
really
felt
obliged
to
me
for
my
*NL*
condescension
.
I
could
have
wished
he
had
been
less
obliged
to
me
,
for
*NL*
he
hovered
about
me
in
his
gratitude
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
and
*NL*
whenever
I
said
a
word
to
Agnes
,
was
sure
,
with
his
shadowless
eyes
and
*NL*
cadaverous
face
,
to
be
looking
gauntly
down
upon
us
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*

us

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
other
guests
--
all
iced
for
the
occasion
,
as
it
struck
me
,
*NL*
like
the
wine
.
But
,
there
was
one
who
attracted
my
attention
before
he
*NL*
came
in
,
on
account
of
my
hearing
him
announced
as
Mr.
Traddles
!
My
mind
*NL*
flew
back
to
Salem
House
;
and
could
it
be
Tommy
,
I
thought
,
who
used
to
*NL*
draw
the
skeletons
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
for
Mr.
Traddles
with
unusual
interest
.
He
was
a
sober
,
*NL*
steady-looking
young
man
of
retiring
manners
,
with
a
comic
head
of
*NL*
hair
,
and
eyes
that
were
rather
wide
open
;
and
he
got
into
an
obscure
*NL*
corner
so
soon
,
that
I
had
some
difficulty
in
making
him
out
.
At
length
*NL*
I
had
a
good
view
of
him
,
and
either
my
vision
deceived
me
,
or
it
was
*NL*
the
old
unfortunate
Tommy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
my
way
to
Mr.
Waterbrook
,
and
said
,
that
I
believed
I
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
seeing
an
old
schoolfellow
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Mr.
Waterbrook
,
surprised
.
``
You
are
too
young
to
have
*NL*
been
at
school
with
Mr.
Henry
Spiker
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mean
him
!
''
I
returned
.
``
I
mean
the
gentleman
named
*NL*
Traddles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Aye
,
aye
!
Indeed
!
''
said
my
host
,
with
much
diminished
interest
.
*NL*
``
Possibly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
really
the
same
person
,
''
said
I
,
glancing
towards
him
,
``
it
was
*NL*
at
a
place
called
Salem
House
where
we
were
together
,
and
he
was
an
*NL*
excellent
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
Traddles
is
a
good
fellow
,
''
returned
my
host
,
nodding
his
head
*NL*
with
an
air
of
toleration
.
``
Traddles
is
quite
a
good
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
curious
coincidence
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
really
,
''
returned
my
host
,
``
quite
a
coincidence
,
that
Traddles
*NL*
should
be
here
at
all
:
as
Traddles
was
only
invited
this
morning
,
when
*NL*
the
place
at
table
,
intended
to
be
occupied
by
Mrs.
Henry
Spiker
's
*NL*
brother
,
became
vacant
,
in
consequence
of
his
indisposition
.
A
very
*NL*
gentlemanly
man
,
Mrs.
Henry
Spiker
's
brother
,
Mr.
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
murmured
an
assent
,
which
was
full
of
feeling
,
considering
that
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
at
all
about
him
;
and
I
inquired
what
Mr.
Traddles
was
by
*NL*
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Traddles
,
''
returned
Mr.
Waterbrook
,
``
is
a
young
man
reading
for
the
*NL*
bar
.
Yes
.
He
is
quite
a
good
fellow
--
nobody
's
enemy
but
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
his
own
enemy
?
''
said
I
,
sorry
to
hear
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returned
Mr.
Waterbrook
,
pursing
up
his
mouth
,
and
playing
with
*NL*
his
watch-chain
,
in
a
comfortable
,
prosperous
sort
of
way
.
``
I
should
say
*NL*
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
stand
in
their
own
light
.
Yes
,
I
should
say
*NL*
he
would
never
,
for
example
,
be
worth
five
hundred
pound
.
Traddles
was
*NL*
recommended
to
me
,
by
a
professional
friend
.
Oh
yes
.
Yes
.
He
has
a
kind
*NL*
of
talent
,
for
drawing
briefs
,
and
stating
a
case
in
writing
,
plainly
.
I
*NL*
am
able
to
throw
something
in
Traddles
's
way
,
in
the
course
of
the
year
;
*NL*
something
--
for
him
--
considerable
.
Oh
yes
.
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
much
impressed
by
the
extremely
comfortable
and
satisfied
manner
,
*NL*
in
which
Mr.
Waterbrook
delivered
himself
of
this
little
word
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
every
now
and
then
.
There
was
wonderful
expression
in
it
.
It
completely
*NL*
conveyed
the
idea
of
a
man
who
had
been
born
,
not
to
say
with
a
silver
*NL*
spoon
,
but
with
a
scaling-ladder
,
and
had
gone
on
mounting
all
the
*NL*
heights
of
life
one
after
another
,
until
now
he
looked
,
from
the
top
of
*NL*
the
fortifications
,
with
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
and
a
patron
,
on
the
*NL*
people
down
in
the
trenches
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
reflections
on
this
theme
were
still
in
progress
when
dinner
was
*NL*
announced
.
Mr.
Waterbrook
went
down
with
Hamlet
's
aunt
.
Mr.
Henry
Spiker
*NL*
took
Mrs.
Waterbrook
.
Agnes
,
whom
I
should
have
liked
to
take
myself
,
*NL*
was
given
to
a
simpering
fellow
with
weak
legs
.
Uriah
,
Traddles
,
and
I
,
*NL*
as
the
junior
part
of
the
company
,
went
down
last
,
how
we
could
.
I
was
*NL*
not
so
vexed
at
losing
Agnes
as
I
might
have
been
since
it
gave
me
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
making
myself
known
to
Traddles
on
the
stairs
,
who
*NL*
greeted
me
with
great
fervor
:
while
Uriah
writhed
with
such
obtrusive
*NL*
satisfaction
and
self-abasement
,
that
I
could
gladly
have
pitched
him
*NL*
over
the
bannisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
and
I
were
separated
at
table
,
being
billeted
in
two
remote
*NL*
corners
:
he
in
the
glare
of
a
red
velvet
lady
;
I
,
in
the
gloom
of
*NL*
Hamlet
's
aunt
.
The
dinner
was
very
long
,
and
the
conversation
was
about
*NL*
the
Aristocracy
--
and
Blood
.
Mrs.
Waterbrook
repeatedly
told
us
,
that
if
*NL*
she
had
a
weakness
,
it
was
Blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
me
several
times
that
we
should
have
got
on
better
,
if
we
*NL*
had
not
been
quite
so
genteel
.
We
were
so
exceedingly
genteel
,
that
our
*NL*
scope
was
very
limited
.
A
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gulpidge
were
of
the
party
,
who
*NL*
had
something
to
do
at
second-hand
-LRB-
at
least
,
Mr.
Gulpidge
had
-RRB-
with
the
*NL*
law
business
of
the
Bank
;
and
what
with
the
Bank
,
and
what
with
the
*NL*
Treasury
,
we
were
as
exclusive
as
the
Court
Circular
.
To
mend
the
*NL*
matter
,
Hamlet
's
aunt
had
the
family
failing
of
indulging
in
soliloquy
,
*NL*
and
held
forth
in
a
desultory
manner
,
by
herself
,
on
every
topic
that
*NL*
was
introduced
.
These
were
few
enough
,
to
be
sure
;
but
as
we
always
fell
*NL*
back
upon
Blood
,
she
had
as
wide
a
field
for
abstract
speculation
as
her
*NL*
nephew
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
might
have
been
a
party
of
Ogres
,
the
conversation
assumed
such
a
*NL*
sanguine
complexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
I
am
of
Mrs.
Waterbrook
's
opinion
,
''
said
Mr.
Waterbrook
,
with
*NL*
his
wine-glass
at
his
eye
.
``
Other
things
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
,
*NL*
but
give
me
Blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
There
is
nothing
,
''
observed
Hamlet
's
aunt
,
``
so
satisfactory
to
one
!
*NL*
There
is
nothing
that
is
so
much
one
's
_
beau-ideal
_
of
--
of
all
that
sort
*NL*
of
thing
,
speaking
generally
.
There
are
some
low
minds
-LRB-
not
many
,
I
am
*NL*
happy
to
believe
,
but
there
are
_
some
_
-RRB-
that
would
prefer
to
do
what
_
I
_
*NL*
should
call
bow
down
before
idols
.
Positively
Idols
!
Before
services
,
*NL*
intellect
,
and
so
on
.
But
these
are
intangible
points
.
Blood
is
not
so
.
*NL*
We
see
Blood
in
a
nose
,
and
we
know
it
.
We
meet
with
it
in
a
chin
,
and
*NL*
we
say
,
`
There
it
is
!
That
's
Blood
!
'
It
is
an
actual
matter
of
fact
.
We
*NL*
point
it
out
.
It
admits
of
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
simpering
fellow
with
the
weak
legs
,
who
had
taken
Agnes
down
,
*NL*
stated
the
question
more
decisively
yet
,
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
,
deuce
take
it
,
''
said
this
gentleman
,
looking
round
the
*NL*
board
with
an
imbecile
smile
,
``
we
ca
n't
forego
Blood
,
you
know
.
We
must
*NL*
have
Blood
,
you
know
.
Some
young
fellows
,
you
know
,
may
be
a
little
*NL*
behind
their
station
,
perhaps
,
in
point
of
education
and
behaviour
,
and
*NL*
may
go
a
little
wrong
,
you
know
,
and
get
themselves
and
other
people
*NL*
into
a
variety
of
fixes
--
and
all
that
--
but
deuce
take
it
,
it
's
*NL*
delightful
to
reflect
that
they
've
got
Blood
in
'em
!
Myself
,
I
'd
rather
*NL*
at
any
time
be
knocked
down
by
a
man
who
had
got
Blood
in
him
,
than
I
'd
*NL*
be
picked
up
by
a
man
who
had
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sentiment
,
as
compressing
the
general
question
into
a
nutshell
,
*NL*
gave
the
utmost
satisfaction
,
and
brought
the
gentleman
into
great
*NL*
notice
until
the
ladies
retired
.
After
that
,
I
observed
that
Mr.
*NL*
Gulpidge
and
Mr.
Henry
Spiker
,
who
had
hitherto
been
very
distant
,
*NL*
entered
into
a
defensive
alliance
against
us
,
the
common
enemy
,
and
*NL*
exchanged
a
mysterious
dialogue
across
the
table
for
our
defeat
and
*NL*
overthrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
affair
of
the
first
bond
for
four
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
has
*NL*
not
taken
the
course
that
was
expected
,
Gulpidge

''
said
Mr.
Henry
*NL*
Spiker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
the
D.
of
A.
's
?
''
said
Mr.
Spiker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
C.
of
B.
's

''
said
Mr.
Gulpidge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spiker
raised
his
eye-brows
,
and
looked
much
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
question
was
referred
to
Lord
--
I
need
n't
name
him
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gulpidge
,
checking
himself
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
Spiker
,
``
N.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

darkly
nodded
--
``

his
answer
was
,
*NL*
`
Money
,
or
no
release
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
''
cried
Mr.
Spiker
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Money
,
or
no
release
,

''
repeated
Mr.
Gulpidge
firmly
.
``
The
next
in
*NL*
reversion
--
you
understand
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
K.
''
said
Mr.
Spiker
,
with
an
ominous
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
K.
then
positively
refused
to
sign
.
He
was
attended
at
Newmarket
for
*NL*
that
purpose
,
and
he
point-blank
refused
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spiker
was
so
interested
,
that
he
became
quite
stony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
matter
rests
at
this
hour
,
''
said
Mr.
Gulpidge
,
throwing
himself
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
.
``
Our
friend
Waterbrook
will
excuse
me
if
I
forbear
to
*NL*
explain
myself
generally
,
on
account
of
the
magnitude
of
the
interests
*NL*
involved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Waterbrook
was
only
too
happy
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
,
to
have
such
*NL*
interests
,
and
such
names
,
even
hinted
at
,
across
his
table
.
He
assumed
*NL*
an
expression
of
gloomy
intelligence
-LRB-
though
I
am
persuaded
he
knew
no
*NL*
more
about
the
discussion
than
I
did
-RRB-
,
and
highly
approved
of
the
*NL*
discretion
that
had
been
observed
.
Mr.
Spiker
,
after
the
receipt
of
such
*NL*
a
confidence
,
naturally
desired
to
favor
his
friend
with
a
confidence
of
*NL*
his
own
;
therefore
the
foregoing
dialogue
was
succeeded
by
another
,
in
*NL*
which
it
was
Mr.
Gulpidge
's
turn
to
be
surprised
,
and
that
by
another
in
*NL*
which
the
surprise
came
round
to
Mr.
Spiker
's
turn
again
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
turn
and
turn
about
.
All
this
time
we
,
the
outsiders
,
remained
oppressed
*NL*
by
the
tremendous
interests
involved
in
the
conversation
;
and
our
host
*NL*
regarded
us
with
pride
,
as
the
victims
of
a
salutary
awe
and
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
glad
indeed
to
get
up-stairs
to
Agnes
,
and
to
talk
with
her
*NL*
in
a
corner
,
and
to
introduce
Traddles
to
her
,
who
was
shy
,
but
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
the
same
good-natured
creature
still
.
As
he
was
obliged
*NL*
to
leave
early
,
on
account
of
going
away
next
morning
for
a
month
,
I
had
*NL*
not
nearly
so
much
conversation
with
him
as
I
could
have
wished
;
but
we
*NL*
exchanged
addresses
,
and
promised
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
another
*NL*
meeting
when
he
should
come
back
to
town
.
He
was
greatly
interested
to
*NL*
hear
that
I
knew
Steerforth
,
and
spoke
of
him
with
such
warmth
that
I
*NL*
made
him
tell
Agnes
what
he
thought
of
him
.
But
Agnes
only
looked
at
me
*NL*
the
while
,
and
very
slightly
shook
her
head
when
only
I
observed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
not
among
people
with
whom
I
believed
she
could
be
very
much
*NL*
at
home
,
I
was
almost
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
going
away
within
a
few
*NL*
days
,
though
I
was
sorry
at
the
prospect
of
parting
from
her
again
so
*NL*
soon
.
This
caused
me
to
remain
until
all
the
company
were
gone
.
*NL*
Conversing
with
her
,
and
hearing
her
sing
,
was
such
a
delightful
*NL*
reminder
to
me
of
my
happy
life
in
the
grave
old
house
she
had
made
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
that
I
could
have
remained
there
half
the
night
;
but
,
having
*NL*
no
excuse
for
staying
any
longer
,
when
the
lights
of
Mr.
Waterbrook
's
*NL*
society
were
all
snuffed
out
,
I
took
my
leave
very
much
against
my
*NL*
inclination
.
I
felt
then
,
more
than
ever
,
that
she
was
my
better
Angel
;
*NL*
and
if
I
thought
of
her
sweet
face
and
placid
smile
,
as
though
they
had
*NL*
shone
on
me
from
some
removed
being
,
like
an
Angel
,
I
hope
I
thought
no
*NL*
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
that
the
company
were
all
gone
;
but
I
ought
to
have
excepted
*NL*
Uriah
,
whom
I
do
n't
include
in
that
denomination
,
and
who
had
never
*NL*
ceased
to
hover
near
us
.
He
was
close
behind
me
when
I
went
down-stairs
.
*NL*
He
was
close
beside
me
,
when
I
walked
away
from
the
house
,
slowly
*NL*
fitting
his
long
skeleton
fingers
into
the
still
longer
fingers
of
a
*NL*
great
Guy
Fawkes
pair
of
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
no
disposition
for
Uriah
's
company
,
but
in
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
entreaty
Agnes
had
made
to
me
,
that
I
asked
him
if
he
would
come
home
to
*NL*
my
rooms
,
and
have
some
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
rejoined
,
--
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
*NL*
Mister
Copperfield
,
but
the
other
comes
so
natural
,
--
I
do
n't
like
that
*NL*
you
should
put
a
constraint
upon
yourself
to
ask
a
numble
person
like
me
*NL*
to
your
ouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
constraint
in
the
case
,
''
said
I.
``
Will
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
,
very
much
,
''
replied
Uriah
,
with
a
writhe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
come
along
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
being
rather
short
with
him
,
but
he
appeared
not
to
*NL*
mind
it
.
We
went
the
nearest
way
,
without
conversing
much
upon
the
road
;
*NL*
and
he
was
so
humble
in
respect
of
those
scarecrow
gloves
,
that
he
was
*NL*
still
putting
them
on
,
and
seemed
to
have
made
no
advance
in
that
*NL*
labour
,
when
we
got
to
my
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
led
him
up
the
dark
stairs
,
to
prevent
his
knocking
his
head
against
*NL*
anything
,
and
really
his
damp
cold
hand
felt
so
like
a
frog
in
mine
,
*NL*
that
I
was
tempted
to
drop
it
and
run
away
.
Agnes
and
hospitality
*NL*
prevailed
,
however
,
and
I
conducted
him
to
my
fireside
.
When
I
lighted
*NL*
my
candles
,
he
fell
into
meek
transports
with
the
room
that
was
revealed
*NL*
to
him
;
and
when
I
heated
the
coffee
in
an
unassuming
block-tin
vessel
,
*NL*
in
which
Mrs.
Crupp
delighted
to
prepare
it
-LRB-
chiefly
,
I
believe
,
because
*NL*
it
was
not
intended
for
the
purpose
,
being
a
shaving-pot
,
and
because
*NL*
there
was
a
patent
invention
of
great
price
mouldering
away
in
the
*NL*
pantry
-RRB-
,
he
professed
so
much
emotion
,
that
I
could
joyfully
have
*NL*
scalded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
--
I
mean
Mister
Copperfield
,
''
said
*NL*
Uriah
,
``
to
see
you
waiting
upon
me
is
what
I
never
could
have
expected
!
*NL*
But
,
one
way
and
another
,
so
many
things
happen
to
me
which
I
never
*NL*
could
have
expected
,
I
am
sure
,
in
my
umble
station
,
that
it
seems
to
*NL*
rain
blessings
on
my
ed
.
You
have
heard
something
,
I
des-say
,
of
a
*NL*
change
in
my
expectations
,
Master
Copperfield
,
--
_
I
_
should
say
,
Mister
*NL*
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
on
my
sofa
,
with
his
long
knees
drawn
up
under
his
coffee-cup
,
*NL*
his
hat
and
gloves
upon
the
ground
close
to
him
,
his
spoon
going
softly
*NL*
round
and
round
,
his
shadowless
red
eyes
,
which
looked
as
if
they
had
*NL*
scorched
their
lashes
off
,
turned
towards
me
without
looking
at
me
,
the
*NL*
disagreeable
dints
I
have
formerly
described
in
his
nostrils
coming
and
*NL*
going
with
his
breath
,
and
a
snaky
undulation
pervading
his
frame
from
*NL*
his
chin
to
his
boots
,
I
decided
in
my
own
mind
that
I
disliked
him
*NL*
intensely
.
It
made
me
very
uncomfortable
to
have
him
for
a
guest
,
for
I
*NL*
was
young
then
,
and
unused
to
disguise
what
I
so
strongly
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

observed
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
I
,
``
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
thought
Miss
Agnes
would
know

he
quietly
returned
.
``
I

*NL*
glad

Oh
,
thank
you

*NL*
Copperfield

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
have
thrown
my
bootjack
at
him
-LRB-
it
lay
ready
on
the
rug
-RRB-
,
for
*NL*
having
entrapped
me
into
the
disclosure
of
anything
concerning
Agnes
,
*NL*
however
immaterial
.
But
I
only
drank
my
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
prophet
you
have
shown
yourself
,
Mister
Copperfield
!
''
pursued
*NL*
Uriah
.
``
Dear
me
,
what
a
prophet
you
have
proved
yourself
to
be
!
Do
n't
*NL*
you
remember
saying
to
me
once
,
that
perhaps
I
should
be
a
partner
in
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
's
business
,
and
perhaps
it
might
be
Wickfield
and
Heep
!
*NL*
_
You
_
may
not
recollect
it
;
but
when
a
person
is
umble
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
,
a
person
treasures
such
things
up
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recollect
talking
about
it

said
I
,
``
though
I
certainly
did
not
*NL*
think
it
very
likely
then

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

who

would

have
thought
it
likely

returned
*NL*
Uriah
,
enthusiastically
,
``
I
am
sure
I
did
n't
myself

I
recollect
saying
*NL*
with
my
own
lips
that
I
was
much
too
umble

So
I
considered
myself
*NL*
really

truly

*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
,
with
that
carved
grin
on
his
face
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
as
I
*NL*
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

presently
resumed

``
may

glad

I
have
been
the

that
I
may
be
more
so

Oh
what
*NL*
a

how
imprudent
he
has
been

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it

said
I.
I
could
not
help
adding
,
rather
*NL*
pointedly
,
``
on
all
accounts

*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly

On

I
_
remember
how
you
said
one
day
*NL*
that
everybody
must
admire
her

how
I
thanked
you
for
it

You
have
*NL*
forgot
that

I
have
no
doubt

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
I
,
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

glad

am

not

exclaimed
Uriah
.
``
To
think
that
you

should
be
the
first
to
kindle
the
sparks

ambition
in
my
umble

*NL*
and
that
you
've
not
forgot
it
!
Oh
!

Would
you
excuse
me
asking
for
a
cup
*NL*
more
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
emphasis
he
laid
upon
the
kindling
of
those
sparks
,
and
*NL*
something
in
the
glance
he
directed
at
me
as
he
said
it
,
had
made
me
*NL*
start
as
if
I
had
seen
him
illuminated
by
a
blaze
of
light
.
Recalled
by
*NL*
his
request
,
preferred
in
quite
another
tone
of
voice
,
I
did
the
honors
*NL*
of
the
shaving-pot
;
but
I
did
them
with
an
unsteadiness
of
hand
,
a
*NL*
sudden
sense
of
being
no
match
for
him
,
and
a
perplexed
suspicious
*NL*
anxiety
as
to
what
he
might
be
going
to
say
next
,
which
I
felt
could
not
*NL*
escape
his
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
nothing
at
all
.
He
stirred
his
coffee
round
and
round
,
he
sipped
*NL*
it
,
he
felt
his
chin
softly
with
his
grisly
hand
,
he
looked
at
the
fire
,
*NL*
he
looked
about
the
room
,
he
gasped
rather
than
smiled
at
me
,
he
writhed
*NL*
and
undulated
about
,
in
his
deferential
servility
,
he
stirred
and
sipped
*NL*
again
,
but
he
left
the
renewal
of
the
conversation
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Mr.
Wickfield

''
said
I
,
at
last
,
``
who
is
worth
five
hundred
of

you

me

for
my
life
,
I
think
I
could
not
have
helped
dividing
that
*NL*
part
of
the
sentence
with
an
awkward
jerk
;
``
has
been
imprudent

has
he

*NL*
Mr.
Heep

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
very

Uriah

sighing
*NL*
modestly
.
``
Oh
very
much
so

But

said
I
,
bolting
it
out
with
some
difficulty

he
returned
,
with
fervor

the
blowing
of
old
breezes

the
ringing
of
old
bellses
to
*NL*
hear
_
you

Uriah

beg
your
pardon

Was
I
making
any

*NL*
``
About

I
suggested

Un

his
thumb

''
said
Uriah
,
very
slowly
,
as
he
stretched
*NL*
out
his
cruel-looking
hand
above
my
table
,
and
pressed
his
own
thumb
*NL*
down
upon
it
,
until
it
shook
,
and
shook
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
been
obliged
to
look
at
him
with
his
splay
foot
on
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
's
head
,
I
think
I
could
scarcely
have
hated
him
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
proceeded
,
in
a
soft
voice
,
most
*NL*
remarkably
contrasting
with
the
action
of
his
thumb
,
which
did
not
*NL*
diminish
its
hard
pressure
in
the
least
degree
,
``
there
's
no
doubt
of
it
.
*NL*
There
would
have
been
loss
,
disgrace
,
I
do
n't
know
what
all
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
knows
it
.
I
am
the
umble
instrument
of
umbly
serving
him
,
and
*NL*
he
puts
me
on
an
eminence
I
hardly
could
have
hoped
to
reach
.
How
*NL*
thankful
should
I
be
!
''
With
his
face
turned
towards
me
,
as
he
finished
,
*NL*
but
without
looking
at
me
,
he
took
his
crooked
thumb
off
the
spot
where
*NL*
he
had
planted
it
,
and
slowly
and
thoughtfully
scraped
his
lank
jaw
with
*NL*
it
,
as
if
he
were
shaving
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
recollect
well
how
indignantly
my
heart
beat
,
as
I
saw
his
crafty
*NL*
face
,
with
the
appropriately
red
light
of
the
fire
upon
it
,
preparing
*NL*
for
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
began
--
``
but
am
I
keeping
you
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
keeping
me
up
.
I
generally
go
to
bed
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield

I
have
risen
from
my
umble
station

first
you
used

is
true
;
but
I
am
umble
still

I
hope
I
*NL*
never
shall
be
otherwise
than
umble

You
will
not
think
the
worse
of
my
*NL*
umbleness

if
I
make
a
little
confidence
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield

*NL*
Will
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no

''
said
I
,
with
an
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
He
took
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
began
wiping
the
*NL*
palms
of
his
hands
.
``
Miss
Agnes

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

pleasant

he
cried
;
and
gave
*NL*
himself
a
jerk
,
like
a
convulsive
fish
.
``
You
thought
her
looking
very
*NL*
beautiful
to-night
,
Master
Copperfield

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
her
looking
as
she
always
does

superior

in
all
respects

to
*NL*
every
one
around
her

I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
!
It
's
so
true
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Oh
,
thank
you
very
much
for
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

I
said
,
loftily
.
``
There
is
no
reason
why
you
should
thank
*NL*
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
,
Master
Copperfield

''
said
Uriah
,
``
is
,
in
fact

the
confidence

I
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
reposing

Umble
as
I
am

''
he
*NL*
wiped
his
hands
harder
,
and
looked
at
them
and
at
the
fire
by
turns
,
*NL*
``
umble
as
my
mother
is
,
and
lowly
as
our
poor
but
honest
roof
has
ever
*NL*
been
,
the
image
of
Miss
Agnes
-LRB-
I
do
n't
mind
trusting
you
with
my
secret
,
*NL*
Master
Copperfield
,
for
I
have
always
overflowed
towards
you
since
the
*NL*
first
moment
I
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
you
in
a
poney-shay
-RRB-
has
*NL*
been
in
my
breast
for
years
.
Oh
,
Master
Copperfield
,
with
what
a
pure
*NL*
affection
do
I
love
the
ground
my
Agnes
walks
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
I
had
a
delirious
idea
of
seizing
the
red-hot
poker
out
of
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
running
him
through
with
it
.
It
went
from
me
with
a
shock
,
*NL*
like
a
ball
fired
from
a
rifle
:
but
the
image
of
Agnes
,
outraged
by
so
*NL*
much
as
a
thought
of
this
red-headed
animal
's
,
remained
in
my
mind
when
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
,
sitting
all
awry
as
if
his
mean
soul
griped
his
body
,
*NL*
and
made
me
giddy
.
He
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
before
my
eyes
;
the
room
*NL*
seemed
full
of
the
echoes
of
his
voice
;
and
the
strange
feeling
-LRB-
to
*NL*
which
,
perhaps
,
no
one
is
quite
a
stranger
-RRB-
that
all
this
had
occurred
*NL*
before
,
at
some
indefinite
time
,
and
that
I
knew
what
he
was
going
to
*NL*
say
next
,
took
possession
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
timely
observation
of
the
sense
of
power
that
there
was
in
his
face
,
*NL*
did
more
to
bring
back
to
my
remembrance
the
entreaty
of
Agnes
,
in
its
*NL*
full
force
,
than
any
effort
I
could
have
made
.
I
asked
him
,
with
a
*NL*
better
appearance
of
composure
than
I
could
have
thought
possible
a
*NL*
minute
before
,
whether
he
had
made
his
feelings
known
to
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
he
returned
;
``
oh
dear
,
no
!
Not
to
any
one
*NL*
but
you
.
You
see
I
am
only
just
emerging
from
my
lowly
station
.
I
rest
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
hope
on
her
observing
how
useful
I
am
to
her
father
-LRB-
for
I
*NL*
trust
to
be
very
useful
to
him
,
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
-RRB-

and
how
I
*NL*
smooth
the
way
for
him
,

keep
him
straight

She
's
so
much
attached
to
*NL*
her
father
,
Master
Copperfield
-LRB-
oh
what
a
lovely
thing
it
is
in
a
*NL*
daughter

-RRB-
,
that
I
think
she
may
come
,
on
his
account
,
to
be
kind
to
*NL*
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
fathomed
the
depth
of
the
rascal
's
whole
scheme
,
and
understood
why
he
*NL*
laid
it
bare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
have
the
goodness
to
keep
my
secret

he
*NL*
pursued
,
``
and
not

in
general

go
against

shall
take

You

make
unpleasantness

I
know
what
*NL*
a
friendly

you

having
only
known
me
on
my
umble

I
should
say

for
I
am
very
umble
still

you
*NL*
might

unbeknown

go
against
me
rather
,
with
my
Agnes

I
call
her
mine

*NL*
you
see

Copperfield

There
's
a
song
that
says
,

I
'd
crowns
*NL*
resign
,
to
call
her
mine
!

I
hope
to
do
it
,
one
of
these
days

*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Agnes
!
So
much
too
loving
and
too
good
for
any
one
that
I
could
*NL*
think
of
,
was
it
possible
that
she
was
reserved
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
*NL*
wretch
as
this
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
hurry
at
present
,
you
know
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
Uriah
*NL*
proceeded
,
in
his
slimy
way
,
as
I
sat
gazing
at
him
,
with
this
thought
*NL*
in
my
mind
.
``
My
Agnes
is
very
young
still
;
and
mother
and
me
will
have
*NL*
to
work
our
way
upards
,
and
make
a
good
many
new
arrangements
,
before
it
*NL*
would
be
quite
convenient
.
So
I
shall
have
time
gradually
to
make
her
*NL*
familiar
with
my
hopes
,
as
opportunities
offer
.
Oh
,
I
'm
so
much
obliged
*NL*
to
you
for
this
confidence
!
Oh
,
it
's
such
a
relief
,
you
ca
n't
think
,
to
*NL*
know
that
you
understand
our
situation
,
and
are
certain
-LRB-
as
you
would
n't
*NL*
wish
to
make
unpleasantness
in
the
family
-RRB-
not
to
go
against
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
hand
which
I
dared
not
withhold
,
and
having
given
it
a
damp
*NL*
squeeze
,
referred
to
his
pale-faced
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
he
said
,
``
it
's
past
one
.
The
moments
slip
away
so
,
in
the
*NL*
confidence
of
old
times
,
Master
Copperfield
,
that
it
's
almost
half-past
*NL*
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
that
I
had
thought
it
was
later
.
Not
that
I
had
really
*NL*
thought
so
,
but
because
my
conversational
powers
were
effectually
*NL*
scattered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
he
said
,
considering
.
``
The
ouse
that
I
am
stopping
at

a
sort
*NL*
of
a
private
hotel
and
boarding
ouse

Master
Copperfield
,
near
the
New
*NL*
River
ed
--
will
have
gone
to
bed
these
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
''
I
returned
,
``
that
there
is
only
one
bed
here
,
and
that
*NL*
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
think
of
mentioning
beds
,
Master
Copperfield

''
he
rejoined
*NL*
ecstatically
,
drawing
up
one
leg
.
``
But
_
would
_
you
have
any
objections
*NL*
to
my
laying
down
before
the
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
comes
to
that
,
''
I
said
,
``
pray
take
my
bed
,
and
I
'll
lie
down
*NL*
before
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
repudiation
of
this
offer
was
almost
shrill
enough
,
in
the
excess
of
*NL*
its
surprise
and
humility
,
to
have
penetrated
to
the
ears
of
Mrs.
Crupp
,
*NL*
then
sleeping
,
I
suppose
,
in
a
distant
chamber
,
situated
at
about
the
*NL*
level
of
low
water
mark
,
soothed
in
her
slumbers
by
the
ticking
of
an
*NL*
incorrigible
clock
,
to
which
she
always
referred
me
when
we
had
any
*NL*
little
difference
on
the
score
of
punctuality
,
and
which
was
never
less
*NL*
than
three
quarters
of
an
hour
too
slow
,
and
had
always
been
put
right
*NL*
in
the
morning
by
the
best
authorities
.
As
no
arguments
I
could
urge
,
in
*NL*
my
bewildered
condition
,
had
the
least
effect
upon
his
modesty
in
*NL*
inducing
him
to
accept
my
bed-room
,
I
was
obliged
to
make
the
best
*NL*
arrangements
I
could
,
for
his
repose
before
the
fire
.
The
mattress
of
*NL*
the
sofa
-LRB-
which
was
a
great
deal
too
short
for
his
lank
figure
-RRB-
,
the
*NL*
sofa
pillows
,
a
blanket
,
the
table-cover
,
a
clean
breakfast-cloth
,
and
a
*NL*
great
coat
,
made
him
a
bed
and
covering
,
for
which
he
was
more
than
*NL*
thankful
.
Having
lent
him
a
nightcap
,
which
he
put
on
at
once
,
and
in
*NL*
which
he
made
such
an
awful
figure
that
I
have
never
worn
one
since
,
I
*NL*
left
him
to
his
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
shall
forget
that
night
.
I
never
shall
forget
how
I
turned
and
*NL*
tumbled
;
how
I
wearied
myself
with
thinking
about
Agnes
and
this
*NL*
creature
;
how
I
considered
what
could
I
do
,
and
what
ought
I
to
do
;
how
*NL*
I
could
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
the
best
course
for
her
*NL*
peace
,
was
to
do
nothing
,
and
to
keep
to
myself
what
I
had
heard
.
If
I
*NL*
went
to
sleep
for
a
few
moments
,
the
image
of
Agnes
with
her
tender
*NL*
eyes
,
and
of
her
father
looking
fondly
on
her
,
as
I
had
so
often
seen
*NL*
him
look
,
arose
before
me
with
appealing
faces
,
and
filled
me
with
vague
*NL*
terrors
.
When
I
awoke
,
the
recollection
that
Uriah
was
lying
in
the
next
*NL*
room
sat
heavy
on
me
like
a
waking
night-mare
;
and
oppressed
me
with
a
*NL*
leaden
dread
,
as
if
I
had
had
some
meaner
quality
of
devil
for
a
lodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poker
got
into
my
dozing
thoughts
besides
,
and
would
n't
come
out
.
I
*NL*
thought
,
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
that
it
was
still
red
hot
,
and
I
*NL*
had
snatched
it
out
of
the
fire
,
and
run
him
through
the
body
.
I
was
so
*NL*
haunted
at
last
by
the
idea
,
though
I
knew
there
was
nothing
in
it
,
that
*NL*
I
stole
into
the
next
room
to
look
at
him
.
There
I
saw
him
,
lying
on
his
*NL*
back
,
with
his
legs
extending
to
I
do
n't
know
where
,
gurglings
taking
*NL*
place
in
his
throat
,
stoppages
in
his
nose
,
and
his
mouth
open
like
a
*NL*
post-office
.
He
was
so
much
worse
in
reality
than
in
my
distempered
*NL*
fancy
,
that
afterwards
I
was
attracted
to
him
in
very
repulsion
,
and
*NL*
could
not
help
wandering
in
and
out
every
half
hour
or
so
,
and
taking
*NL*
another
look
at
him
.
Still
,
the
long
,
long
night
seemed
heavy
and
*NL*
hopeless
as
ever
,
and
no
promise
of
day
was
in
the
murky
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
saw
him
going
down
stairs
early
in
the
morning
-LRB-
for
,
thank
*NL*
Heaven
!
he
would
not
stay
to
breakfast
-RRB-
,
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
the
*NL*
night
was
going
away
in
his
person
.
When
I
went
out
to
the
Commons
,
I
*NL*
charged
Mrs.
Crupp
with
particular
directions
to
leave
the
windows
open
,
*NL*
that
my
sitting-room
might
be
aired
,
and
purged
of
his
presence
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
I
FALL
INTO
CAPTIVITY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
no
more
of
Uriah
Heep
,
until
the
day
when
Agnes
left
town
.
I
was
*NL*
at
the
coach-office
to
take
leave
of
her
and
see
her
go
;
and
there
was
*NL*
he
,
returning
to
Canterbury
by
the
same
conveyance
.
It
was
some
small
*NL*
satisfaction
to
me
to
observe
his
spare
,
short-waisted
,
high-shouldered
,
*NL*
mulberry-coloured
great-coat
perched
up
,
in
company
with
an
umbrella
*NL*
like
a
small
tent
,
on
the
edge
of
the
back
seat
on
the
roof
,
while
Agnes
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
inside
;
but
what
I
underwent
in
my
efforts
to
be
*NL*
friendly
with
him
,
while
Agnes
looked
on
,
perhaps
deserved
that
little
*NL*
recompense
.
At
the
coach-window
,
as
at
the
dinner-party
,
he
hovered
*NL*
about
us
without
a
moment
's
intermission
,
like
a
great
vulture
:
gorging
*NL*
himself
on
every
syllable
that
I
said
to
Agnes
,
or
Agnes
said
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
state
of
trouble
into
which
his
disclosure
by
my
fire
had
thrown
*NL*
me
,
I
had
thought
very
much
of
the
words
Agnes
had
used
in
reference
to
*NL*
the
partnership
.
``
I
did
what
I
hope
was
right
.
Feeling
sure
that
it
was
*NL*
necessary
for
papa
's
peace
that
the
sacrifice
should
be
made
,
I
*NL*
entreated
him
to
make
it
.
''
A
miserable
foreboding
that
she
would
yield
*NL*
to
,
and
sustain
herself
by
,
the
same
feeling
in
reference
to
any
*NL*
sacrifice
for
his
sake
,
had
oppressed
me
ever
since
.
I
knew
how
she
*NL*
loved
him
.
I
knew
what
the
devotion
of
her
nature
was
.
I
knew
from
her
*NL*
own
lips
that
she
regarded
herself
as
the
innocent
cause
of
his
errors
,
*NL*
and
as
owing
him
a
great
debt
she
ardently
desired
to
pay
.
I
had
no
*NL*
consolation
in
seeing
how
different
she
was
from
this
detestable
Rufus
*NL*
with
the
mulberry-coloured
great-coat
,
for
I
felt
that
in
the
very
*NL*
difference
between
them
,
in
the
self-denial
of
her
pure
soul
and
the
*NL*
sordid
baseness
of
his
,
the
greatest
danger
lay
.
All
this
,
doubtless
,
he
*NL*
knew
thoroughly
,
and
had
,
in
his
cunning
,
considered
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
I
was
so
certain
that
the
prospect
of
such
a
sacrifice
afar
off
,
*NL*
must
destroy
the
happiness
of
Agnes
;
and
I
was
so
sure
,
from
her
manner
,
*NL*
of
its
being
unseen
by
her
then
,
and
having
cast
no
shadow
on
her
yet
;
*NL*
that
I
could
as
soon
have
injured
her
,
as
given
her
any
warning
of
what
*NL*
impended
.
Thus
it
was
that
we
parted
without
explanation
:
she
waving
her
*NL*
hand
and
smiling
farewell
from
the
coach-window
;
her
evil
genius
*NL*
writhing
on
the
roof
,
as
if
he
had
her
in
his
clutches
and
triumphed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
get
over
this
farewell
glimpse
of
them
for
a
long
time
.
When
*NL*
Agnes
wrote
to
tell
me
of
her
safe
arrival
,
I
was
as
miserable
as
when
I
*NL*
saw
her
going
away
.
Whenever
I
fell
into
a
thoughtful
state
,
this
*NL*
subject
was
sure
to
present
itself
,
and
all
my
uneasiness
was
sure
to
be
*NL*
redoubled
.
Hardly
a
night
passed
without
my
dreaming
of
it
.
It
became
a
*NL*
part
of
my
life
,
and
as
inseparable
from
my
life
as
my
own
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
ample
leisure
to
refine
upon
my
uneasiness
:
for
Steerforth
was
at
*NL*
Oxford
,
as
he
wrote
to
me
,
and
when
I
was
not
at
the
Commons
,
I
was
very
*NL*
much
alone
.
I
believe
I
had
at
this
time
some
lurking
distrust
of
*NL*
Steerforth
.
I
wrote
to
him
most
affectionately
in
reply
to
his
,
but
I
*NL*
think
I
was
glad
,
upon
the
whole
,
that
he
could
not
come
to
London
just
*NL*
then
.
I
suspect
the
truth
to
be
,
that
the
influence
of
Agnes
was
upon
*NL*
me
,
undisturbed
by
the
sight
of
him
;
and
that
it
was
the
more
powerful
*NL*
with
me
,
because
she
had
so
large
a
share
in
my
thoughts
and
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
days
and
weeks
slipped
away
.
I
was
articled
to
Spenlow
*NL*
and
Jorkins
.
I
had
ninety
pounds
a
year
-LRB-
exclusive
of
my
house-rent
and
*NL*
sundry
collateral
matters
-RRB-
from
my
aunt
.
My
rooms
were
engaged
for
*NL*
twelve
months
certain
:
and
though
I
still
found
them
dreary
of
an
*NL*
evening
,
and
the
evenings
long
,
I
could
settle
down
into
a
state
of
*NL*
equable
low
spirits
,
and
resign
myself
to
coffee
;
which
I
seem
,
on
*NL*
looking
back
,
to
have
taken
by
the
gallon
at
about
this
period
of
my
*NL*
existence
.
At
about
this
time
,
too
,
I
made
three
discoveries
:
first
,
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Crupp
was
a
martyr
to
a
curious
disorder
called
``
the
*NL*
spazzums
,
''
which
was
generally
accompanied
with
inflammation
of
the
*NL*
nose
,
and
required
to
be
constantly
treated
with
peppermint
;
secondly
,
*NL*
that
something
peculiar
in
the
temperature
of
my
pantry
,
made
the
*NL*
brandy-bottles
burst
;
thirdly
,
that
I
was
alone
in
the
world
,
and
much
*NL*
given
to
record
that
circumstance
in
fragments
of
English
versification
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
I
was
articled
,
no
festivity
took
place
,
beyond
my
*NL*
having
sandwiches
and
sherry
into
the
office
for
the
clerks
,
and
going
*NL*
alone
to
the
theatre
at
night
.
I
went
to
see
``
The
Stranger
''
as
a
*NL*
Doctors
'
Commons
sort
of
play
,
and
was
so
dreadfully
cut
up
,
that
I
*NL*
hardly
knew
myself
in
my
own
glass
when
I
got
home
.
Mr.
Spenlow
*NL*
remarked
,
on
this
occasion
,
when
we
concluded
our
business
,
that
he
*NL*
should
have
been
happy
to
have
seen
me
at
his
house
at
Norwood
to
*NL*
celebrate
our
becoming
connected
,
but
for
his
domestic
arrangements
*NL*
being
in
some
disorder
,
on
account
of
the
expected
return
of
his
*NL*
daughter
from
finishing
her
education
at
Paris
.
But
,
he
intimated
that
*NL*
when
she
came
home
he
should
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
*NL*
me
.
I
knew
that
he
was
a
widower
with
one
daughter
,
and
expressed
my
*NL*
acknowledgments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
was
as
good
as
his
word
.
In
a
week
or
two
,
he
referred
to
*NL*
this
engagement
,
and
said
,
that
if
I
would
do
him
the
favor
to
come
down
*NL*
next
Saturday
,
and
stay
till
Monday
,
he
would
be
extremely
happy
.
Of
*NL*
course
I
said
I
_
would
_
do
him
the
favor
;
and
he
was
to
drive
me
down
in
*NL*
his
phaeton
,
and
to
bring
me
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
day
arrived
,
my
very
carpet-bag
was
an
object
of
veneration
to
*NL*
the
stipendiary
clerks
,
to
whom
the
house
at
Norwood
was
a
sacred
*NL*
mystery
.
One
of
them
informed
me
that
he
had
heard
that
Mr.
Spenlow
ate
*NL*
entirely
off
plate
and
china
;
and
another
hinted
at
champagne
being
*NL*
constantly
on
draught
,
after
the
usual
custom
of
table
beer
.
The
old
*NL*
clerk
with
the
wig
,
whose
name
was
Mr.
Tiffey
,
had
been
down
on
business
*NL*
several
times
in
the
course
of
his
career
,
and
had
on
each
occasion
*NL*
penetrated
to
the
breakfast-parlor
.
He
described
it
as
an
apartment
of
*NL*
the
most
sumptuous
nature
,
and
said
that
he
had
drunk
brown
East
India
*NL*
sherry
there
,
of
a
quality
so
precious
as
to
make
a
man
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
an
adjourned
cause
in
the
Consistory
that
day
--
about
*NL*
excommunicating
a
baker
who
had
been
objecting
in
a
vestry
to
a
*NL*
paving-rate
--
and
as
the
evidence
was
just
twice
the
length
of
Robinson
*NL*
Crusoe
,
according
to
a
calculation
I
made
,
it
was
rather
late
in
the
*NL*
day
before
we
finished
.
However
,
we
got
him
excommunicated
for
six
*NL*
weeks
,
and
sentenced
in
no
end
of
costs
;
and
then
the
baker
's
proctor
,
*NL*
and
the
judge
,
and
the
advocates
on
both
sides
-LRB-
who
were
all
nearly
*NL*
related
-RRB-
,
went
out
of
town
together
,
and
Mr.
Spenlow
and
I
drove
away
*NL*
in
the
phaeton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phaeton
was
a
very
handsome
affair
;
the
horses
arched
their
necks
*NL*
and
lifted
up
their
legs
as
if
they
knew
they
belonged
to
Doctors
'
*NL*
Commons
.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
competition
in
the
Commons
on
all
*NL*
points
of
display
,
and
it
turned
out
some
very
choice
equipages
then
;
*NL*
though
I
always
have
considered
,
and
always
shall
consider
,
that
in
my
*NL*
time
the
great
article
of
competition
there
was
starch
:
which
I
think
*NL*
was
worn
among
the
proctors
to
as
great
an
extent
as
it
is
in
the
nature
*NL*
of
man
to
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
very
pleasant
,
going
down
,
and
Mr.
Spenlow
gave
me
some
hints
in
*NL*
reference
to
my
profession
.
He
said
it
was
the
genteelest
profession
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
must
on
no
account
be
confounded
with
the
profession
of
a
*NL*
solicitor
:
being
quite
another
sort
of
thing
,
infinitely
more
exclusive
,
*NL*
less
mechanical
,
and
more
profitable
.
We
took
things
much
more
easily
in
*NL*
the
Commons
than
they
could
be
taken
anywhere
else
,
he
observed
,
and
*NL*
that
set
us
,
as
a
privileged
class
,
apart
.
He
said
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
conceal
the
disagreeable
fact
,
that
we
were
chiefly
employed
by
*NL*
solicitors
;
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
were
an
inferior
race
*NL*
of
men
,
universally
looked
down
upon
by
all
proctors
of
any
pretensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
Mr.
Spenlow
what
he
considered
the
best
sort
of
professional
*NL*
business
?
He
replied
,
that
a
good
case
of
a
disputed
will
,
where
there
*NL*
was
a
neat
little
estate
of
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pounds
,
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
the
best
of
all
.
In
such
a
case
,
he
said
,
not
only
were
there
*NL*
very
pretty
pickings
in
the
way
of
arguments
at
every
stage
of
the
*NL*
proceedings
,
and
mountains
upon
mountains
of
evidence
on
interrogatory
*NL*
and
counter-interrogatory
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
an
appeal
lying
,
first
to
*NL*
the
Delegates
,
and
then
to
the
Lords
-RRB-
;
but
,
the
costs
being
pretty
sure
*NL*
to
come
out
of
the
estate
at
last
,
both
sides
went
at
it
in
a
lively
and
*NL*
spirited
manner
,
and
expense
was
no
consideration
.
Then
,
he
launched
*NL*
into
a
general
eulogium
on
the
Commons
.
What
was
to
be
particularly
*NL*
admired
-LRB-
he
said
-RRB-
in
the
Commons
,
was
its
compactness
.
It
was
the
most
*NL*
conveniently
organised
place
in
the
world
.
It
was
the
complete
idea
of
*NL*
snugness
.
It
lay
in
a
nut-shell
.
For
example
:
You
brought
a
divorce
*NL*
case
,
or
a
restitution
case
,
into
the
Consistory
.
Very
good
.
You
tried
*NL*
it
in
the
Consistory
.
You
made
a
quiet
little
round
game
of
it
,
among
a
*NL*
family
group
,
and
you
played
it
out
at
leisure
.
Suppose
you
were
not
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
Consistory
,
what
did
you
do
then
?
Why
,
you
went
into
*NL*
the
Arches
.
What
was
the
Arches
?
The
same
court
,
in
the
same
room
,
with
*NL*
the
same
bar
,
and
the
same
practitioners
,
but
another
judge
,
for
there
*NL*
the
Consistory
judge
could
plead
any
court-day
as
an
advocate
.
Well
,
you
*NL*
played
your
round
game
out
again
.
Still
you
were
not
satisfied
.
Very
*NL*
good
.
What
did
you
do
then
?
Why
,
you
went
to
the
Delegates
.
Who
were
the
*NL*
Delegates
?
Why
,
the
Ecclesiastical
Delegates
were
the
advocates
without
*NL*
any
business
,
who
had
looked
on
at
the
round
game
when
it
was
playing
in
*NL*
both
courts
,
and
had
seen
the
cards
shuffled
,
and
cut
,
and
played
,
and
*NL*
had
talked
to
all
the
players
about
it
,
and
now
came
fresh
,
as
judges
,
*NL*
to
settle
the
matter
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
!
Discontented
*NL*
people
might
talk
of
corruption
in
the
Commons
,
closeness
in
the
*NL*
Commons
,
and
the
necessity
of
reforming
the
Commons
,
said
Mr.
Spenlow
*NL*
solemnly
,
in
conclusion
;
but
when
the
price
of
wheat
per
bushel
had
been
*NL*
highest
,
the
Commons
had
been
busiest
;
and
a
man
might
lay
his
hand
upon
*NL*
his
heart
,
and
say
this
to
the
whole
world
,
--
``
Touch
the
Commons
,
and
*NL*
down
comes
the
country
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
to
all
this
with
attention
;
and
though
,
I
must
say
,
I
had
my
*NL*
doubts
whether
the
country
was
quite
as
much
obliged
to
the
Commons
as
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
made
out
,
I
respectfully
deferred
to
his
opinion
.
That
about
*NL*
the
price
of
wheat
per
bushel
,
I
modestly
felt
was
too
much
for
my
*NL*
strength
,
and
quite
settled
the
question
.
I
have
never
,
to
this
hour
,
*NL*
got
the
better
of
that
bushel
of
wheat
.
It
has
re-appeared
to
annihilate
*NL*
me
,
all
through
my
life
,
in
connexion
with
all
kinds
of
subjects
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
now
,
exactly
,
what
it
has
to
do
with
me
,
or
what
right
it
has
*NL*
to
crush
me
,
on
an
infinite
variety
of
occasions
;
but
whenever
I
see
my
*NL*
old
friend
the
bushel
brought
in
by
the
head
and
shoulders
-LRB-
as
he
always
*NL*
is
,
I
observe
-RRB-
,
I
give
up
a
subject
for
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
digression
.
_
I
_
was
not
the
man
to
touch
the
Commons
,
and
*NL*
bring
down
the
country
.
I
submissively
expressed
,
by
my
silence
,
my
*NL*
acquiescence
in
all
I
had
heard
from
my
superior
in
years
and
knowledge
;
*NL*
and
we
talked
about
``
The
Stranger
''
and
the
Drama
,
and
the
pair
of
*NL*
horses
,
until
we
came
to
Mr.
Spenlow
's
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
lovely
garden
to
Mr.
Spenlow
's
house
;
and
though
that
was
*NL*
not
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
seeing
a
garden
,
it
was
so
beautifully
*NL*
kept
,
that
I
was
quite
enchanted
.
There
was
a
charming
lawn
,
there
were
*NL*
clusters
of
trees
,
and
there
were
perspective
walks
that
I
could
just
*NL*
distinguish
in
the
dark
,
arched
over
with
trellis-work
,
on
which
shrubs
*NL*
and
flowers
grew
in
the
growing
season
.
``
Here
Miss
Spenlow
walks
by
*NL*
herself
,
''
I
thought
.
``
Dear
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
into
the
house
,
which
was
cheerfully
lighted
up
,
and
into
a
hall
*NL*
where
there
were
all
sorts
of
hats
,
caps
,
great-coats
,
plaids
,
gloves
,
*NL*
whips
,
and
walking-sticks
.
``
Where
is
Miss
Dora
?
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
to
the
*NL*
servant
.
``
Dora
!
''
I
thought
.
``
What
a
beautiful
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
turned
into
a
room
near
at
hand
-LRB-
I
think
it
was
the
identical
*NL*
breakfast-room
,
made
memorable
by
the
brown
East
Indian
Sherry
-RRB-
,
and
I
*NL*
heard
a
voice
say
,
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
my
daughter
Dora
,
and
my
daughter
*NL*
Dora
's
confidential
friend
!
''
It
was
,
no
doubt
,
Mr.
Spenlow
's
voice
,
but
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
it
,
and
I
did
n't
care
whose
it
was
.
All
was
over
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
I
had
fulfilled
my
destiny
.
I
was
a
captive
and
a
slave
.
I
loved
*NL*
Dora
Spenlow
to
distraction
!
*NL*

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
more
than
human
to
me
.
She
was
a
Fairy
,
a
Sylph
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
she
was
--
any
thing
that
no
one
ever
saw
,
and
every
thing
that
every
*NL*
body
ever
wanted
.
I
was
swallowed
up
in
an
abyss
of
love
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
There
was
no
pausing
on
the
brink
;
no
looking
down
,
or
looking
back
;
I
*NL*
was
gone
,
headlong
,
before
I
had
sense
to
say
a
word
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
,
''
observed
a
well-remembered
voice
,
when
I
had
bowed
and
murmured
*NL*
something
,
``
have
seen
Mr.
Copperfield
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
was
not
Dora
.
No
;
the
confidential
friend
.
Miss
Murdstone
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
I
was
much
astonished
.
To
the
best
of
my
judgment
,
no
*NL*
capacity
of
astonishment
was
left
in
me
.
There
was
nothing
worth
*NL*
mentioning
in
the
material
world
,
but
Dora
Spenlow
,
to
be
astonished
*NL*
about
.
I
said
,
``
How
do
you
do
,
Miss
Murdstone
?
I
hope
you
are
well
.
''
She
*NL*
answered
,
``
Very
well
.
''
I
said
,
``
How
is
Mr.
Murdstone
?
''
She
replied
,
``
My
*NL*
brother
is
robust
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
had
been
surprised
to
see
us
recognise
each
*NL*
other
,
then
put
in
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
find
,
''
he
said
,
``
Copperfield
,
that
you
and
Miss
Murdstone
*NL*
are
already
acquainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
and
myself
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
with
severe
*NL*
composure
,
``
are
connexions
.
We
were
once
slightly
acquainted
.
It
was
in
*NL*
his
childish
days
.
Circumstances
have
separated
us
since
.
I
should
not
*NL*
have
known
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
I
should
have
known
her
,
any
where
.
Which
was
true
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Murdstone
has
had
the
goodness
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
to
me
,
``
to
*NL*
accept
the
office
--
if
I
may
so
describe
it
--
of
my
daughter
Dora
's
*NL*
confidential
friend
.
My
daughter
Dora
having
,
unhappily
,
no
mother
,
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
is
obliging
enough
to
become
her
companion
and
protector
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
passing
thought
occurred
to
me
that
Miss
Murdstone
,
like
the
pocket
*NL*
instrument
called
a
life-preserver
,
was
not
so
much
designed
for
*NL*
purposes
of
protection
as
of
assault
.
But
as
I
had
none
but
passing
*NL*
thoughts
for
any
subject
save
Dora
,
I
glanced
at
her
,
directly
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
was
thinking
that
I
saw
,
in
her
prettily
pettish
manner
,
*NL*
that
she
was
not
very
much
inclined
to
be
particularly
confidential
to
*NL*
her
companion
and
protector
,
when
a
bell
rang
,
which
Mr.
Spenlow
said
*NL*
was
the
first
dinner-bell
,
and
so
carried
me
off
to
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
dressing
one
's
self
,
or
doing
any
thing
in
the
way
of
*NL*
action
,
in
that
state
of
love
,
was
a
little
too
ridiculous
.
I
could
only
*NL*
sit
down
before
my
fire
,
biting
the
key
of
my
carpet-bag
,
and
think
of
*NL*
the
captivating
,
girlish
,
bright-eyed
lovely
Dora
.
What
a
form
she
had
,
*NL*
what
a
face
she
had
,
what
a
graceful
,
variable
,
enchanting
manner
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
rang
again
so
soon
that
I
made
a
mere
scramble
of
my
dressing
,
*NL*
instead
of
the
careful
operation
I
could
have
wished
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
went
down-stairs
.
There
was
some
company
.
Dora
was
*NL*
talking
to
an
old
gentleman
with
a
grey
head
.
Grey
as
he
was
--
and
a
*NL*
great-grandfather
into
the
bargain
,
for
he
said
so
--
I
was
madly
jealous
*NL*
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
state
of
mind
I
was
in
!
I
was
jealous
of
everybody
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
bear
the
idea
of
anybody
knowing
Mr.
Spenlow
better
than
I
did
.
It
was
*NL*
torturing
to
me
to
hear
them
talk
of
occurrences
in
which
I
had
had
no
*NL*
share
.
When
a
most
amiable
person
,
with
a
highly
polished
bald
head
,
*NL*
asked
me
across
the
dinner-table
,
if
that
were
the
first
occasion
of
my
*NL*
seeing
the
grounds
,
I
could
have
done
anything
to
him
that
was
savage
*NL*
and
revengeful
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
remember
who
was
there
,
except
Dora
.
I
have
not
the
least
idea
*NL*
what
we
had
for
dinner
,
besides
Dora
.
My
impression
is
,
that
I
dined
off
*NL*
Dora
,
entirely
,
and
sent
away
half-a-dozen
plates
untouched
.
I
sat
next
*NL*
to
her
.
I
talked
to
her
.
She
had
the
most
delightful
little
voice
,
the
*NL*
gayest
little
laugh
,
the
pleasantest
and
most
fascinating
little
ways
,
*NL*
that
ever
led
a
lost
youth
into
hopeless
slavery
.
She
was
rather
*NL*
diminutive
altogether
.
So
much
the
more
precious
,
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
out
of
the
room
with
Miss
Murdstone
-LRB-
no
other
ladies
were
*NL*
of
the
party
-RRB-
,
I
fell
into
a
reverie
,
only
disturbed
by
the
cruel
*NL*
apprehension
that
Miss
Murdstone
would
disparage
me
to
her
.
The
amiable
*NL*
creature
with
the
polished
head
told
me
a
long
story
,
which
I
think
was
*NL*
about
gardening
.
I
think
I
heard
him
say
,
``
my
gardener
,
''
several
times
.
*NL*
I
seemed
to
pay
the
deepest
attention
to
him
,
but
I
was
wandering
in
a
*NL*
garden
of
Eden
all
the
while
,
with
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
apprehensions
of
being
disparaged
to
the
object
of
my
engrossing
*NL*
affection
were
revived
when
we
went
into
the
drawing-room
,
by
the
grim
*NL*
and
distant
aspect
of
Miss
Murdstone
.
But
I
was
relieved
of
them
in
an
*NL*
unexpected
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
beckoning
me
aside
into
a
*NL*
window
.
``
A
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
confronted
Miss
Murdstone
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
I
need
not
enlarge
upon
*NL*
family
circumstances
.
They
are
not
a
tempting
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
from
it
,
ma'am
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
from
it
,
''
assented
Miss
Murdstone
.
``
I
do
not
wish
to
revive
the
*NL*
memory
of
past
differences
,
or
of
past
outrages
.
I
have
received
*NL*
outrages
from
a
person
--
a
female
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
for
the
credit
of
my
*NL*
sex
--
who
is
not
to
be
mentioned
without
scorn
and
disgust
;
and
therefore
*NL*
I
would
rather
not
mention
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
very
fiery
on
my
aunt
's
account
;
but
I
said
it
would
certainly
be
*NL*
better
,
if
Miss
Murdstone
pleased
,
_
not
_
to
mention
her
.
I
could
not
*NL*
hear
her
disrespectfully
mentioned
,
I
added
,
without
expressing
my
*NL*
opinion
in
a
decided
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
shut
her
eyes
,
and
disdainfully
inclined
her
head
;
then
,
*NL*
slowly
opening
her
eyes
,
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Copperfield
,
I
shall
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
,
that
I
*NL*
formed
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
you
in
your
childhood
.
It
may
have
been
*NL*
a
mistaken
one
,
or
you
may
have
ceased
to
justify
it
.
That
is
not
in
*NL*
question
between
us
now
.
I
belong
to
a
family
remarkable
,
I
believe
,
for
*NL*
some
firmness
;
and
I
am
not
the
creature
of
circumstance
or
change
.
I
*NL*
may
have
my
opinion
of
you
.
You
may
have
your
opinion
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
inclined
my
head
,
in
my
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
necessary
,
''
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
that
these
opinions
*NL*
should
come
into
collision
here
.
Under
existing
circumstances
,
it
is
as
*NL*
well
on
all
accounts
that
they
should
not
.
As
the
chances
of
life
have
*NL*
brought
us
together
again
,
and
may
bring
us
together
on
other
occasions
,
*NL*
I
would
say
let
us
meet
here
as
distant
acquaintances
.
Family
*NL*
circumstances
are
a
sufficient
reason
for
our
only
meeting
on
that
*NL*
footing
,
and
it
is
quite
unnecessary
that
either
of
us
should
make
the
*NL*
other
the
subject
of
remark
.
Do
you
approve
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Murdstone
,
''
I
returned
,
``
I
think
you
and
Mr.
Murdstone
used
me
*NL*
very
cruelly
,
and
treated
my
mother
with
great
unkindness
.
I
shall
*NL*
always
think
so
,
as
long
as
I
live
.
But
I
quite
agree
in
what
you
*NL*
propose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
shut
her
eyes
again
,
and
bent
her
head
.
Then
,
just
*NL*
touching
the
back
of
my
hand
with
the
tips
of
her
cold
,
stiff
fingers
,
*NL*
she
walked
away
,
arranging
the
little
fetters
on
her
wrists
and
round
*NL*
her
neck
:
which
seemed
to
be
the
same
set
,
in
exactly
the
same
state
,
as
*NL*
when
I
had
seen
her
last
.
These
reminded
me
,
in
reference
to
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
's
nature
,
of
the
fetters
over
a
jail-door
;
suggesting
on
the
*NL*
outside
,
to
all
beholders
,
what
was
to
be
expected
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
I
know
of
the
rest
of
the
evening
is
,
that
I
heard
the
empress
of
my
*NL*
heart
sing
enchanted
ballads
in
the
French
language
,
generally
to
the
*NL*
effect
that
,
whatever
was
the
matter
,
we
ought
always
to
dance
,
Ta
ra
*NL*
la
,
Ta
ra
la
!
accompanying
herself
on
a
glorified
instrument
,
resembling
*NL*
a
guitar
.
That
I
was
lost
in
blissful
delirium
.
That
I
refused
*NL*
refreshment
.
That
my
soul
recoiled
from
punch
particularly
.
That
when
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
took
her
into
custody
and
led
her
away
,
she
smiled
and
*NL*
gave
me
her
delicious
hand
.
That
I
caught
a
view
of
myself
in
a
mirror
,
*NL*
looking
perfectly
imbecile
and
idiotic
.
That
I
retired
to
bed
in
a
most
*NL*
maudlin
state
of
mind
,
and
got
up
in
a
crisis
of
feeble
infatuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fine
morning
,
and
early
,
and
I
thought
I
would
go
and
take
a
*NL*
stroll
down
one
of
those
wire-arched
walks
,
and
indulge
my
passion
by
*NL*
dwelling
on
her
image
.
On
my
way
through
the
hall
,
I
encountered
her
*NL*
little
dog
,
who
was
called
Jip
--
short
for
Gipsy
.
I
approached
him
*NL*
tenderly
,
for
I
loved
even
him
;
but
he
showed
his
whole
set
of
teeth
,
*NL*
got
under
a
chair
expressly
to
snarl
,
and
would
n't
hear
of
the
least
*NL*
familiarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
was
cool
and
solitary
.
I
walked
about
,
wondering
what
my
*NL*
feelings
of
happiness
would
be
,
if
I
could
ever
become
engaged
to
this
*NL*
dear
wonder
.
As
to
marriage
,
and
fortune
,
and
all
that
,
I
believe
I
was
*NL*
almost
as
innocently
undesigning
then
,
as
when
I
loved
little
Em
`
ly
.
To
*NL*
be
allowed
to
call
her
``
Dora
,
''
to
write
to
her
,
to
dote
upon
and
worship
*NL*
her
,
to
have
reason
to
think
that
when
she
was
with
other
people
she
was
*NL*
yet
mindful
of
me
,
seemed
to
me
the
summit
of
human
ambition
--
I
am
sure
*NL*
it
was
the
summit
of
mine
.
There
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
I
was
a
*NL*
lackadaisical
young
spooney
;
but
there
was
a
purity
of
heart
in
all
this
*NL*
still
,
that
prevents
my
having
quite
a
contemptuous
recollection
of
it
,
*NL*
let
me
laugh
as
I
may
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
walking
long
,
when
I
turned
a
corner
,
and
met
her
.
I
*NL*
tingle
again
from
head
to
foot
as
my
recollection
turns
that
corner
,
and
*NL*
my
pen
shakes
in
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
are
--
out
early
,
Miss
Spenlow
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
stupid
at
home
,
''
she
replied
,
``
and
Miss
Murdstone
is
so
absurd
!
*NL*
She
talks
such
nonsense
about
its
being
necessary
for
the
day
to
be
*NL*
aired
,
before
I
come
out
.
Aired
!
''
-LRB-
She
laughed
,
here
,
in
the
most
*NL*
melodious
manner
-RRB-
.
``
On
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
do
n't
practise
,
I
must
*NL*
do
something
.
So
I
told
papa
last
night
I
_
must
_
come
out
.
Besides
,
it
's
*NL*
the
brightest
time
of
the
whole
day
.
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hazarded
a
bold
flight
,
and
said
-LRB-
not
without
stammering
-RRB-
that
it
was
*NL*
very
bright
to
me
then
,
though
it
had
been
very
dark
to
me
a
minute
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
a
compliment
?
''
said
Dora
,
``
or
that
the
weather
has
really
*NL*
changed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stammered
worse
than
before
,
in
replying
that
I
meant
no
compliment
,
*NL*
but
the
plain
truth
;
though
I
was
not
aware
of
any
change
having
taken
*NL*
place
in
the
weather
.
It
was
in
the
state
of
my
own
feelings
,
I
added
*NL*
bashfully
:
to
clench
the
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
such
curls
--
how
could
I
,
for
there
never
were
such
*NL*
curls
!
--
as
those
she
shook
out
to
hide
her
blushes
.
As
to
the
straw
*NL*
hat
and
blue
ribbons
which
was
on
the
top
of
the
curls
,
if
I
could
*NL*
only
have
hung
it
up
in
my
room
in
Buckingham
Street
,
what
a
priceless
*NL*
possession
it
would
have
been
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
just
come
home
from
Paris
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
she
.
``
Have
you
ever
been
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
hope
you
'll
go
soon
.
You
would
like
it
so
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Traces
of
deep-seated
anguish
appeared
in
my
countenance
.
That
she
*NL*
should
hope
I
would
go
,
that
she
should
think
it
possible
I
_
could
_
go
,
*NL*
was
insupportable
.
I
depreciated
Paris
;
I
depreciated
France
.
I
said
I
*NL*
would
n't
leave
England
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
for
any
earthly
*NL*
consideration
.
Nothing
should
induce
me
.
In
short
,
she
was
shaking
the
*NL*
curls
again
,
when
the
little
dog
came
running
along
the
walk
to
our
*NL*
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
mortally
jealous
of
me
,
and
persisted
in
barking
at
me
.
She
took
*NL*
him
up
in
her
arms
--
oh
my
goodness
!
--
and
caressed
him
,
but
he
insisted
*NL*
upon
barking
still
.
He
would
n't
let
me
touch
him
,
when
I
tried
;
and
then
*NL*
she
beat
him
.
It
increased
my
sufferings
greatly
to
see
the
pats
she
*NL*
gave
him
for
punishment
on
the
bridge
of
his
blunt
nose
,
while
he
winked
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
licked
her
hand
,
and
still
growled
within
himself
like
a
*NL*
little
double-bass
.
At
length
he
was
quiet
--
well
he
might
be
with
her
*NL*
dimpled
chin
upon
his
head
!
--
and
we
walked
away
to
look
at
a
greenhouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
very
intimate
with
Miss
Murdstone
,
are
you
?
''
said
*NL*
Dora
.
--
``
My
pet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
The
two
last
words
were
to
the
dog
.
Oh
if
they
had
only
been
to
me
!
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
replied
.
``
Not
at
all
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
tiresome
creature
,
''
said
Dora
pouting
.
``
I
ca
n't
think
what
*NL*
papa
can
have
been
about
,
when
he
chose
such
a
vexatious
thing
to
be
my
*NL*
companion
.
Who
wants
a
protector
!
I
am
sure
_
I
_
do
n't
want
a
protector
.
*NL*
Jip
can
protect
me
a
great
deal
better
than
Miss
Murdstone
,
--
ca
n't
you
,
*NL*
Jip
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
winked
lazily
,
when
she
kissed
his
ball
of
a
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
calls
her
my
confidential
friend
,
but
I
am
sure
she
is
no
such
*NL*
thing
--
is
she
,
Jip
?
We
are
not
going
to
confide
in
any
such
cross
*NL*
people
,
Jip
and
I
.
We
mean
to
bestow
our
confidence
where
we
like
,
*NL*
and
to
find
out
our
own
friends
,
instead
of
having
them
found
out
for
*NL*
us
--
do
n't
we
,
Jip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jip
made
a
comfortable
noise
,
in
answer
,
a
little
like
a
tea-kettle
when
*NL*
it
sings
.
As
for
me
,
every
word
was
a
new
heap
of
fetters
,
rivetted
*NL*
above
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
hard
,
because
we
have
not
a
kind
Mama
,
that
we
are
to
have
,
*NL*
instead
,
a
sulky
,
gloomy
old
thing
like
Miss
Murdstone
,
always
following
*NL*
us
about
--
is
n't
it
,
Jip
?
Never
mind
,
Jip
.
We
wo
n't
be
confidential
,
and
*NL*
we
'll
make
ourselves
as
happy
as
we
can
in
spite
of
her
,
and
we
'll
teaze
*NL*
her
,
and
not
please
her
,
--
wo
n't
we
,
Jip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
lasted
any
longer
,
I
think
I
must
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
*NL*
on
the
gravel
,
with
the
probability
before
me
of
grazing
them
,
and
of
*NL*
being
presently
ejected
from
the
premises
besides
.
But
,
by
good
fortune
*NL*
the
greenhouse
was
not
far
off
,
and
these
words
brought
us
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
contained
quite
a
show
of
beautiful
geraniums
.
We
loitered
along
in
*NL*
front
of
them
,
and
Dora
often
stopped
to
admire
this
one
or
that
one
,
*NL*
and
I
stopped
to
admire
the
same
one
,
and
Dora
,
laughing
,
held
the
dog
*NL*
up
childishly
,
to
smell
the
flowers
;
and
if
we
were
not
all
three
in
*NL*
Fairyland
,
certainly
_
I
_
was
.
The
scent
of
a
geranium
leaf
,
at
this
day
,
*NL*
strikes
me
with
a
half
comical
half
serious
wonder
as
to
what
change
has
*NL*
come
over
me
in
a
moment
;
and
then
I
see
a
straw
hat
and
blue
ribbons
,
*NL*
and
a
quantity
of
curls
,
and
a
little
black
dog
being
held
up
,
in
two
*NL*
slender
arms
,
against
a
bank
of
blossoms
and
bright
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
had
been
looking
for
us
.
She
found
us
here
;
and
*NL*
presented
her
uncongenial
cheek
,
the
little
wrinkles
in
it
filled
with
*NL*
hair-powder
,
to
Dora
to
be
kissed
.
Then
she
took
Dora
's
arm
in
hers
,
*NL*
and
marched
us
in
to
breakfast
as
if
it
were
a
soldier
's
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
many
cups
of
tea
I
drank
,
because
Dora
made
it
,
I
do
n't
know
.
But
,
*NL*
I
perfectly
remember
that
I
sat
swilling
tea
until
my
whole
nervous
*NL*
system
,
if
I
had
had
any
in
those
days
,
must
have
gone
by
the
board
.
*NL*
By-and-by
we
went
to
church
.
Miss
Murdstone
was
between
Dora
and
me
in
*NL*
the
pew
;
but
I
heard
her
sing
,
and
the
congregation
vanished
.
A
sermon
*NL*
was
delivered
--
about
Dora
,
of
course
--
and
I
am
afraid
that
is
all
I
*NL*
know
of
the
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
quiet
day
.
No
company
,
a
walk
,
a
family
dinner
of
four
,
and
an
*NL*
evening
of
looking
over
books
and
pictures
;
Miss
Murdstone
with
a
homily
*NL*
before
her
,
and
her
eye
upon
us
,
keeping
guard
vigilantly
.
Ah
!
little
*NL*
did
Mr.
Spenlow
imagine
,
when
he
sat
opposite
to
me
after
dinner
that
*NL*
day
,
with
his
pocket-handkerchief
over
his
head
,
how
fervently
I
was
*NL*
embracing
him
,
in
my
fancy
,
as
his
son-in-law
!
Little
did
he
think
,
when
*NL*
I
took
leave
of
him
at
night
,
that
he
had
just
given
his
full
consent
to
*NL*
my
being
engaged
to
Dora
,
and
that
I
was
invoking
blessings
on
his
head
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
departed
early
in
the
morning
,
for
we
had
a
Salvage
case
coming
on
in
*NL*
the
Admiralty
Court
,
requiring
a
rather
accurate
knowledge
of
the
whole
*NL*
science
of
navigation
,
in
which
-LRB-
as
we
could
n't
be
expected
to
know
much
*NL*
about
those
matters
in
the
Commons
-RRB-
the
judge
had
entreated
two
old
*NL*
Trinity
Masters
,
for
charity
's
sake
,
to
come
and
help
him
out
.
Dora
was
*NL*
at
the
breakfast-table
to
make
the
tea
again
,
however
;
and
I
had
the
*NL*
melancholy
pleasure
of
taking
off
my
hat
to
her
in
the
phaeton
,
as
she
*NL*
stood
on
the
door-step
with
Jip
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
the
Admiralty
was
to
me
that
day
;
what
nonsense
I
made
of
our
case
*NL*
in
my
mind
,
as
I
listened
to
it
;
how
I
saw
``
DORA
''
engraved
upon
the
*NL*
blade
of
the
silver
oar
which
they
lay
upon
the
table
,
as
the
emblem
of
*NL*
that
high
jurisdiction
;
and
how
I
felt
,
when
Mr.
Spenlow
went
home
*NL*
without
me
-LRB-
I
had
had
an
insane
hope
that
he
might
take
me
back
again
-RRB-
,
*NL*
as
if
I
were
a
mariner
myself
,
and
the
ship
to
which
I
belonged
had
*NL*
sailed
away
and
left
me
on
a
desert
island
;
I
shall
make
no
fruitless
*NL*
effort
to
describe
.
If
that
sleepy
old
court
could
rouse
itself
,
and
*NL*
present
in
any
visible
form
the
day
dreams
I
have
had
in
it
about
Dora
,
*NL*
it
would
reveal
my
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
the
dreams
that
I
dreamed
on
that
day
alone
,
but
day
after
*NL*
day
,
from
week
to
week
,
and
term
to
term
.
I
went
there
,
not
to
attend
*NL*
to
what
was
going
on
,
but
to
think
about
Dora
.
If
I
ever
bestowed
a
*NL*
thought
upon
the
cases
,
as
they
dragged
their
slow
length
before
me
,
it
*NL*
was
only
to
wonder
,
in
the
matrimonial
cases
-LRB-
remembering
Dora
-RRB-
,
how
*NL*
it
was
that
married
people
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
happy
;
and
,
in
*NL*
the
Prerogative
cases
,
to
consider
,
if
the
money
in
question
had
been
*NL*
left
to
me
,
what
were
the
foremost
steps
I
should
immediately
have
*NL*
taken
in
regard
to
Dora
.
Within
the
first
week
of
my
passion
,
I
bought
*NL*
four
sumptuous
waistcoats
--
not
for
myself
;
_
I
_
had
no
pride
in
them
;
*NL*
for
Dora
--
and
took
to
wearing
straw-colored
kid
gloves
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
and
laid
the
foundations
of
all
the
corns
I
have
ever
had
.
If
the
boots
*NL*
I
wore
at
that
period
could
only
be
produced
and
compared
with
the
*NL*
natural
size
of
my
feet
,
they
would
show
what
the
state
of
my
heart
*NL*
was
,
in
a
most
affecting
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
wretched
cripple
as
I
made
myself
by
this
act
of
homage
to
*NL*
Dora
,
I
walked
miles
upon
miles
daily
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
.
Not
*NL*
only
was
I
soon
as
well
known
on
the
Norwood
Road
as
the
postmen
on
that
*NL*
beat
,
but
I
pervaded
London
likewise
.
I
walked
about
the
streets
where
*NL*
the
best
shops
for
ladies
were
,
I
haunted
the
Bazaar
like
an
unquiet
*NL*
spirit
,
I
fagged
through
the
Park
again
and
again
,
long
after
I
was
*NL*
quite
knocked
up
.
Sometimes
,
at
long
intervals
and
on
rare
occasions
,
I
*NL*
saw
her
.
Perhaps
I
saw
her
glove
waved
in
a
carriage
window
;
perhaps
I
*NL*
met
her
,
walked
with
her
and
Miss
Murdstone
a
little
way
,
and
spoke
to
*NL*
her
.
In
the
latter
case
I
was
always
very
miserable
afterwards
,
to
think
*NL*
that
I
had
said
nothing
to
the
purpose
;
or
that
she
had
no
idea
of
the
*NL*
extent
of
my
devotion
,
or
that
she
cared
nothing
about
me
.
I
was
always
*NL*
looking
out
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
for
another
invitation
to
Mr.
Spenlow
's
*NL*
house
.
I
was
always
being
disappointed
,
for
I
got
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
must
have
been
a
woman
of
penetration
;
for
when
this
*NL*
attachment
was
but
a
few
weeks
old
,
and
I
had
not
had
the
courage
to
*NL*
write
more
explicitly
even
to
Agnes
,
than
that
I
had
been
to
Mr.
*NL*
Spenlow
's
house
,
``
whose
family
,
''
I
added
,
``
consists
of
one
daughter
;
''
--
I
*NL*
say
Mrs.
Crupp
must
have
been
a
woman
of
penetration
,
for
,
even
in
that
*NL*
early
stage
,
she
found
it
out
.
She
came
up
to
me
one
evening
,
when
I
was
*NL*
very
low
,
to
ask
-LRB-
she
being
then
afflicted
with
the
disorder
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
-RRB-
if
I
could
oblige
her
with
a
little
tincture
of
cardamums
*NL*
mixed
with
rhubarb
,
and
flavored
with
seven
drops
of
the
essence
of
*NL*
cloves
,
which
was
the
best
remedy
for
her
complaint
;
--
or
,
if
I
had
not
*NL*
such
a
thing
by
me
,
with
a
little
brandy
,
which
was
the
next
best
.
It
*NL*
was
not
,
she
remarked
,
so
palatable
to
her
,
but
it
was
the
next
best
.
As
*NL*
I
had
never
even
heard
of
the
first
remedy
,
and
always
had
the
second
in
*NL*
the
closet
,
I
gave
Mrs.
Crupp
a
glass
of
the
second
,
which
-LRB-
that
I
might
*NL*
have
no
suspicion
of
its
being
devoted
to
any
improper
use
-RRB-
she
began
to
*NL*
take
in
my
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheer
up
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
``
I
ca
n't
abear
to
see
you
so
,
sir
,
I
'm
*NL*
a
mother
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
quite
perceive
the
application
of
this
fact
to
_
my_self
,
but
I
*NL*
smiled
on
Mrs.
Crupp
,
as
benignly
as
was
in
my
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
.
``
Excuse
me
.
I
know
what
it
is
,
sir
.
*NL*
There
's
a
young
lady
in
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Crupp
?
''
I
returned
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
bless
you
!
Keep
a
good
heart
,
sir
!
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
nodding
*NL*
encouragement
.
``
Never
say
die
,
sir
!
If
She
do
n't
smile
upon
you
,
there
's
*NL*
a
many
as
will
.
You
're
a
young
gentleman
to
_
be
_
smiled
on
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfull
,
and
you
must
learn
your
walue
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
always
called
me
Mr.
Copperfull
:
firstly
,
no
doubt
,
because
*NL*
it
was
not
my
name
;
and
secondly
,
I
am
inclined
to
think
,
in
some
*NL*
indistinct
association
with
a
washing-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
suppose
there
is
any
young
lady
in
the
case
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Crupp
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfull
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
with
a
great
deal
of
feeling
,
``
I
'm
a
*NL*
mother
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
Mrs.
Crupp
could
only
lay
her
hand
upon
her
nankeen
bosom
,
*NL*
and
fortify
herself
against
returning
pain
with
sips
of
her
medicine
.
At
*NL*
length
she
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
present
set
were
took
for
you
by
your
dear
aunt
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfull
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
``
my
remark
were
,
I
had
now
found
summun
I
*NL*
could
care
for
.
`
Thank
Ev
`
in
!
'
were
the
expression
,
'
I
have
now
found
*NL*
summun
I
can
care
for
!
'
--
You
do
n't
eat
enough
,
sir
,
nor
yet
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
found
your
supposition
on
,
Mrs.
Crupp
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
in
a
tone
approaching
to
severity
,
``
I
've
*NL*
laundressed
other
young
gentlemen
besides
yourself
.
A
young
gentleman
*NL*
may
be
over-careful
of
himself
,
or
he
may
be
under-careful
of
himself
.
*NL*
He
may
brush
his
hair
too
regular
,
or
too
unregular
.
He
may
wear
his
*NL*
boots
much
too
large
for
him
,
or
much
too
small
.
That
is
according
as
*NL*
the
young
gentleman
has
his
original
character
formed
.
But
let
him
go
to
*NL*
which
extreme
he
may
,
sir
,
there
's
a
young
lady
in
both
of
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
shook
her
head
in
such
a
determined
manner
,
that
I
had
not
an
*NL*
inch
of
`
vantage
ground
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
but
the
gentleman
which
died
here
before
yourself
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Crupp
,
``
that
fell
in
love
--
with
a
barmaid
--
and
had
his
waistcoats
took
*NL*
in
directly
,
though
much
swelled
by
drinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Crupp
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
must
beg
you
not
to
connect
the
young
lady
in
*NL*
my
case
with
a
barmaid
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfull
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Crupp
,
``
I
'm
a
mother
myself
,
and
not
*NL*
likely
.
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
if
I
intrude
.
I
should
never
wish
to
*NL*
intrude
where
I
were
not
welcome
.
But
you
are
a
young
gentleman
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfull
,
and
my
adwice
to
you
is
,
to
cheer
up
,
sir
,
to
keep
a
good
*NL*
heart
,
and
to
know
your
own
walue
.
If
you
was
to
take
to
something
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Crupp
,
``
if
you
was
to
take
to
skittles
,
now
,
which
is
*NL*
healthy
,
you
might
find
it
divert
your
mind
,
and
do
you
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
Mrs.
Crupp
,
affecting
to
be
very
careful
of
the
*NL*
brandy
--
which
it
was
all
gone
--
thanked
me
with
a
majestic
curtsey
,
and
*NL*
retired
.
As
her
figure
disappeared
into
the
gloom
of
the
entry
,
this
*NL*
counsel
certainly
presented
itself
to
my
mind
in
the
light
of
a
slight
*NL*
liberty
on
Mrs.
Crupp
's
part
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
was
content
to
*NL*
receive
it
,
in
another
point
of
view
,
as
a
word
to
the
wise
,
and
a
*NL*
warning
in
future
to
keep
my
secret
better

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
TOMMY
TRADDLES
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
have
been
in
consequence
of
Mrs.
Crupp
's
advice
,
and
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
for
no
better
reason
than
because
there
was
a
certain
similarity
in
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
words
skittles
and
Traddles
,
that
it
came
into
my
head
,
*NL*
next
day
,
to
go
and
look
after
Traddles
.
The
time
he
had
mentioned
was
*NL*
more
than
out
,
and
he
lived
in
a
little
street
near
the
Veterinary
*NL*
College
at
Camden
Town
,
which
was
principally
tenanted
,
as
one
of
our
*NL*
clerks
who
lived
in
that
direction
informed
me
,
by
gentlemen
students
,
*NL*
who
bought
live
donkeys
,
and
made
experiments
on
those
quadrupeds
in
*NL*
their
private
apartments
.
Having
obtained
from
this
clerk
a
direction
to
*NL*
the
academic
grove
in
question
,
I
set
out
,
the
same
afternoon
,
to
visit
*NL*
my
old
schoolfellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
that
the
street
was
not
as
desirable
a
one
as
I
could
have
*NL*
wished
it
to
be
,
for
the
sake
of
Traddles
.
The
inhabitants
appeared
to
*NL*
have
a
propensity
to
throw
any
little
trifles
they
were
not
in
want
of
,
*NL*
into
the
road
:
which
not
only
made
it
rank
and
sloppy
,
but
untidy
too
,
*NL*
on
account
of
the
cabbage-leaves
.
The
refuse
was
not
wholly
vegetable
*NL*
either
,
for
I
myself
saw
a
shoe
,
a
doubled-up
saucepan
,
a
black
bonnet
,
*NL*
and
an
umbrella
,
in
various
stages
of
decomposition
,
as
I
was
looking
*NL*
out
for
the
number
I
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
air
of
the
place
reminded
me
forcibly
of
the
days
when
I
*NL*
lived
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
.
An
indescribable
character
of
faded
*NL*
gentility
that
attached
to
the
house
I
sought
,
and
made
it
unlike
all
*NL*
the
other
houses
in
the
street
--
though
they
were
all
built
on
one
*NL*
monotonous
pattern
,
and
looked
like
the
early
copies
of
a
blundering
boy
*NL*
who
was
learning
to
make
houses
,
and
had
not
yet
got
out
of
his
cramped
*NL*
brick
and
mortar
pothooks
--
reminded
me
still
more
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
.
Happening
to
arrive
at
the
door
as
it
was
opened
to
the
*NL*
afternoon
milkman
,
I
was
reminded
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
more
forcibly
*NL*
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
milkman
to
a
very
youthful
servant
girl
.
``
Has
that
there
*NL*
little
bill
of
mine
been
heerd
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
master
says
he
'll
attend
to
it
immediate
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
the
milkman
,
going
on
as
if
he
had
received
no
answer
,
*NL*
and
speaking
,
as
I
judged
from
his
tone
,
rather
for
the
edification
of
*NL*
somebody
within
the
house
,
than
of
the
youthful
servant
--
an
impression
*NL*
which
was
strengthened
by
his
manner
of
glaring
down
the
*NL*
passage
--
``
Because
that
there
little
bill
has
been
running
so
long
,
that
*NL*
I
begin
to
believe
it
's
run
away
altogether
,
and
never
wo
n't
be
heerd
*NL*
of
.
Now
,
I
'm
not
a
going
to
stand
it
,
you
know
!
''
said
the
milkman
,
still
*NL*
throwing
his
voice
into
the
house
,
and
glaring
down
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
his
dealing
in
the
mild
article
of
milk
,
by-the-by
,
there
never
*NL*
was
a
greater
anomaly
.
His
deportment
would
have
been
fierce
in
a
*NL*
butcher
or
a
brandy
merchant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
the
youthful
servant
became
faint
,
but
she
seemed
to
me
,
*NL*
from
the
action
of
her
lips
,
again
to
murmur
that
it
would
be
attended
*NL*
to
immediate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
,
''
said
the
milkman
,
looking
hard
at
her
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
and
taking
her
by
the
chin
,
``
are
you
fond
of
milk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
likes
it
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
the
milkman
.
``
Then
you
wo
n't
have
none
to-morrow
.
D'ye
*NL*
hear
?
Not
a
fragment
of
milk
you
wo
n't
have
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
she
seemed
,
upon
the
whole
,
relieved
,
by
the
prospect
of
*NL*
having
any
to-day
.
The
milkman
,
after
shaking
his
head
at
her
,
darkly
,
*NL*
released
her
chin
,
and
with
any
thing
rather
than
good
will
opened
his
*NL*
can
,
and
deposited
the
usual
quantity
in
the
family
jug
.
This
done
,
he
*NL*
went
away
,
muttering
,
and
uttered
the
cry
of
his
trade
next
door
,
in
a
*NL*
vindictive
shriek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Mr.
Traddles
live
here
?
''
I
then
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mysterious
voice
from
the
end
of
the
passage
replied
``
Yes
.
''
Upon
which
*NL*
the
youthful
servant
replied
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
at
home
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
mysterious
voice
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
again
the
*NL*
servant
echoed
it
.
Upon
this
,
I
walked
in
,
and
in
pursuance
of
the
*NL*
servant
's
directions
walked
up-stairs
;
conscious
,
as
I
passed
the
back
*NL*
parlor-door
,
that
I
was
surveyed
by
a
mysterious
eye
,
probably
belonging
*NL*
to
the
mysterious
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
--
the
house
was
only
a
story
high
*NL*
above
the
ground
floor
--
Traddles
was
on
the
landing
to
meet
me
.
He
was
*NL*
delighted
to
see
me
,
and
gave
me
welcome
,
with
great
heartiness
,
to
his
*NL*
little
room
.
It
was
in
the
front
of
the
house
,
and
extremely
neat
,
*NL*
though
sparely
furnished
.
It
was
his
only
room
,
I
saw
;
for
there
was
a
*NL*
sofa-bedstead
in
it
,
and
his
blacking-brushes
and
blacking
were
among
*NL*
his
books
--
on
the
top
shelf
,
behind
a
dictionary
.
His
table
was
covered
*NL*
with
papers
,
and
he
was
hard
at
work
in
an
old
coat
.
I
looked
at
*NL*
nothing
,
that
I
know
of
,
but
I
saw
everything
,
even
to
the
prospect
of
a
*NL*
church
upon
his
china
inkstand
,
as
I
sat
down
--
and
this
,
too
,
was
a
*NL*
faculty
confirmed
in
me
in
the
old
Micawber
times
.
Various
ingenious
*NL*
arrangements
he
had
made
,
for
the
disguise
of
his
chest
of
drawers
,
and
*NL*
the
accommodation
of
his
boots
,
his
shaving-glass
,
and
so
forth
,
*NL*
particularly
impressed
themselves
upon
me
,
as
evidences
of
the
same
*NL*
Traddles
who
used
to
make
models
of
elephant
's
dens
in
writing
paper
to
*NL*
put
flies
in
;
and
to
comfort
himself
,
under
ill
usage
,
with
the
*NL*
memorable
works
of
art
I
have
so
often
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
corner
of
the
room
was
something
neatly
covered
up
with
a
large
*NL*
white
cloth
.
I
could
not
make
out
what
that
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Traddles
,
''
said
I
,
shaking
hands
with
him
again
,
after
I
had
sat
down
.
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
to
see
_
you
_
,
Copperfield
,
''
he
returned
.
``
I
am
very
glad
*NL*
indeed
to
see
you
.
It
was
because
I
was
thoroughly
glad
to
see
you
when
*NL*
we
met
in
Ely
Place
,
and
was
sure
you
were
thoroughly
glad
to
see
me
,
*NL*
that
I
gave
you
this
address
instead
of
my
address
at
chambers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
have
chambers
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
have
the
fourth
of
a
room
and
a
passage
,
and
the
fourth
of
a
*NL*
clerk
,
''
returned
Traddles
.
``
Three
others
and
myself
unite
to
have
a
set
*NL*
of
chambers
--
to
look
business-like
--
and
we
quarter
the
clerk
too
.
*NL*
Half-a-crown
a
week
he
costs
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
old
simple
character
and
good
temper
,
and
something
of
his
old
*NL*
unlucky
fortune
also
,
I
thought
,
smiled
at
me
in
the
smile
with
which
he
*NL*
made
this
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
because
I
have
the
least
pride
,
Copperfield
,
you
understand
,
''
*NL*
said
Traddles
,
``
that
I
do
n't
usually
give
my
address
here
.
It
's
only
on
*NL*
account
of
those
who
come
to
me
,
who
might
not
like
to
come
here
.
For
*NL*
myself
,
I
am
fighting
my
way
on
in
the
world
against
difficulties
,
and
*NL*
it
would
be
ridiculous
if
I
made
a
pretence
of
doing
any
thing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
reading
for
the
bar
,
Mr.
Waterbrook
informed
me
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
said
Traddles
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
slowly
over
one
another
,
*NL*
``
I
am
reading
for
the
bar
.
The
fact
is
,
I
have
just
begun
to
keep
my
*NL*
terms
,
after
rather
a
long
delay
.
It
's
some
time
since
I
was
articled
,
*NL*
but
the
payment
of
that
hundred
pounds
was
a
great
pull
.
A
great
pull
!
''
*NL*
said
Traddles
,
with
a
wince
,
as
if
he
had
had
a
tooth
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
,
Traddles
,
as
I
sit
here
*NL*
looking
at
you
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Traddles

laughing

Tight
in

you

Dear

Well

Those
were
happy

were
n't
they

*NL*
*NL*

I

made

any

any

I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
might

''
said
Traddles
.
``
But
dear
me
,
there
was
a
good
deal

of
fun
going
on

Do
you
remember
the
nights
in
the
bed-room
?
When
we
*NL*
used
to
have
the
suppers
?
And
when
you
used
to
tell
the
stories
?
Ha
,
ha
,
*NL*
ha
!
And
do
you
remember
when
I
got
caned
for
crying
about
Mr.

Old

Creakle

I
should
like

see
him
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
brute
to
you

Traddles

said
I
,
indignantly
;
for
his
good
*NL*
humour
made
me
feel
as
if
I
had
seen
him
beaten
but
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?

returned
Traddles
.
``
Really
?
Perhaps
he
was

rather

it
's
all
over

a
long
while

Old
Creakle

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
brought
up
by
an
uncle

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

I
was

said
Traddles
.
``
The
one

Yes

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

He
was
a
retired

what
do
you
call

draper

cloth-merchant

had
made
me
his

But
he
did
n't

like
me
when
I
grew
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
mean
that

said
I

He
was
so
composed

that
I
fancied
he

must
have
some
other
meaning

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
dear
yes

Copperfield
!
I
mean
it

replied
Traddles
.
``
It
was
an
*NL*
unfortunate
thing
,

he
did
n't
like
me

He
said
I

n't
at
all

what
he
expected
,

so
he
married
his
housekeeper

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
do

I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*

I

Traddles
.

I
lived

waiting
to
be
put
out
in
the
world

until
his
gout
unfortunately
flew
to
*NL*
his
stomach
--
and
so
he
died
,
and
so
she
married
a
young
man

so
I

was

provided
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
nothing

Traddles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Traddles
.
``
I
got
fifty
pounds

I
had
never
been

brought
up
to
any
profession
,
and
at
first
I
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
*NL*
for
myself
.
However
,
I
began
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
son
of
a
*NL*
professional
man
,
who
had
been
to
Salem
House
--
Yawler
,
with
his
nose
on
*NL*
one
side
.
Do
you
recollect
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
He
had
not
been
there
with
me
;
all
the
noses
were
straight
,
in
my
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
do
n't
matter
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
I
began
,
by
means
of
his
assistance
,
*NL*
to
copy
law
writings
.
That
did
n't
answer
very
well
;
and
then
I
began
to
*NL*
state
cases
for
them
,
and
make
abstracts
,
and
do
that
sort
of
work
.
For
*NL*
I
am
a
plodding
kind
of
fellow
,
Copperfield
,
and
had
learnt
the
way
of
*NL*
doing
such
things
pithily
.
Well
!
That
put
it
in
my
head
to
enter
myself
*NL*
as
a
law
student
;
and
that
ran
away
with
all
that
was
left
of
the
fifty
*NL*
pounds
.
Yawler
recommended
me
to
one
or
two
other
offices
,
however
--
Mr.
*NL*
Waterbrook
's
for
one
--
and
I
got
a
good
many
jobs
.
I
was
fortunate
*NL*
enough
,
too
,
to
become
acquainted
with
a
person
in
the
publishing
way
,
*NL*
who
was
getting
up
an
Encyclopaedia
,
and
he
set
me
to
work
;
and
,
indeed
''
*NL*
-LRB-
glancing
at
his
table
-RRB-
,
``
I
am
at
work
for
him
at
this
minute
.
I
am
not
*NL*
a
bad
compiler
,
Copperfield
,
''
said
Traddles
,
preserving
the
same
air
of
*NL*
cheerful
confidence
in
all
he
said
,
``
but
I
have
no
invention
at
all
;
not
*NL*
a
particle
.
I
suppose
there
never
was
a
young
man
with
less
originality
*NL*
than
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Traddles
seemed
to
expect
that
I
should
assent
to
this
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
,
I
nodded
;
and
he
went
on
,
with
the
same
sprightly
patience
--
I
*NL*
can
find
no
better
expression
--
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
by
little
and
little
,
and
not
living
high
,
I
managed
to
scrape
up
*NL*
the
hundred
pounds
at
last
,
''
said
Traddles
;
``
and
thank
Heaven
that
's
*NL*
paid
--
though
it
was
--
though
it
certainly
was
,
''
said
Traddles
,
wincing
*NL*
again
as
if
he
had
had
another
tooth
out
,
``
a
pull
.
I
am
living
by
the
*NL*
sort
of
work
I
have
mentioned
,
still
,
and
I
hope
,
one
of
these
days
,
to
*NL*
get
connected
with
some
newspaper
:
which
would
almost
be
the
making
of
*NL*
my
fortune

Now
,
Copperfield
,
you
are
so
exactly
what
you
used
to
be
,
*NL*
with
that
agreeable
face
,
and
it
's
so
pleasant
to
see
you
,
that
I
*NL*
sha
'n'

conceal
anything

Therefore
you
must
know
that
I
am
engaged

''
*NL*
*NL*
Engaged
!
Oh
Dora
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
curate
's
daughter
,
''
said
Traddles
;
``
one
of
ten
,
down
in
*NL*
Devonshire
.
Yes
!
''
For
he
saw
me
glance
,
involuntarily
,
at
the
prospect
*NL*
on
the
inkstand
.
``
That
's
the
church
!
You
come
round
here

to
the
left

*NL*
out

tracing
his
finger
along
the
inkstand
,
``
and
exactly
*NL*
where
I
hold
this
pen
,
there
stands
the
house

facing

you

*NL*
towards
the
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
delight
with
which
he
entered
into
these
particulars
,
did
not
fully
*NL*
present
itself
to
me
until
afterwards
;
for
my
selfish
thoughts
were
*NL*
making
a
ground-plan
of
Mr.
Spenlow
's
house
and
garden
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
such
a
dear
girl
!
''
said
Traddles
;
``
a
little
older
than
me

*NL*
the

I
told
you
I
was
going
out

I
have
been
down
*NL*
there

I
walked
there
,

I
walked
back

I
had
the
most
delightful
*NL*
time
!
I
dare
say
ours
is
likely
to
be
a
rather
long
engagement
,
but
our
*NL*
motto
is
`
Wait
and
hope

We
always
say
that

`
Wait
and
hope

we
always

And
she
would
wait

Copperfield
,

she
was
sixty

any
age

can
mention

for
me

*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
,
with
a
triumphant
smile
,
put
his
hand
*NL*
upon
the
white
cloth
I
had
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However

he
said
,

drawing
the

off
with
great
pride

You
put
that
in

parlor-window

said
Traddles
,
falling
*NL*
a
little
back
from
it
to
survey
it
with
the
greater
admiration
,
``
with
a
*NL*
plant
in
it

there
you
are

marble
top

's
two
feet
ten
in
circumference

I

bought

want
to
*NL*
lay
a
book
down
,
you
know
,
or
somebody
comes
to
see
you

your
wife
,
*NL*

wants
a
place
to
stand
a
cup
of
tea
upon
,

there
you
are

again

said
Traddles

``
It
's
an
admirable
piece
of
workmanship

firm
as
*NL*
a
rock

*NL*
*NL*
I
praised
them
both
,
highly
,
and
Traddles
replaced
the
covering
as
*NL*
carefully
as
he
had
removed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
great
deal

the
furnishing

said
Traddles
,
``

*NL*
it
's
something

The
table-cloths
and
pillow-cases

articles

of
that

are
what
discourage
me
most

Copperfield
.
So
does
*NL*
the
ironmongery
--
candle-boxes
,
and
gridirons
,
and
that
sort
of
*NL*
necessaries

because
those
things
tell

mount
up

However

I.

*NL*
``

Traddles

coming
back

I
board
with

down-stairs

are
very
agreeable

was
talking

repeated

An
opportune
double
knock
at
the
door

which
I
knew
well
from
old
*NL*
experience
in
Windsor
Terrace
,
and
which
nobody
but
Mr.
Micawber
could
*NL*
ever
have
knocked
at
that
door
,
resolved
any
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
*NL*
their
being
my
old
friends

I
begged
Traddles
to
ask
his
landlord
to
*NL*
walk
up
.
Traddles
accordingly
did
so
,
over
the
bannister
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
,
not
a
bit
changed
--
his
tights

his
stick
,
his
shirt-collar
,
*NL*
and
his
eye-glass
,
all
the

as
ever

came
into

genteel
and
youthful
air

*NL*
*NL*
``

your
pardon

Mr.

with
the
old
roll

in
his
voice

he
checked
himself
in
humming
a
soft
tune

Mr.

slightly
bowed

pulled
up
his
shirt-collar

now

Micawber
,
``
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
Cathedral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
it
was
.
Mr.
Micawber
continued
talking
as
volubly
as
he
*NL*
could
;
but
not
,
I
thought
,
without
showing
,
by
some
marks
of
concern
in
*NL*
his
countenance
,
that
he
was
sensible
of
sounds
in
the
next
room
,
as
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
washing
her
hands
,
and
hurriedly
opening
and
shutting
*NL*
drawers
that
were
uneasy
in
their
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
us
,
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
one
eye
on
Traddles
,
*NL*
``
at
present
established
,
on
what
may
be
designated
as
a
small
and
*NL*
unassuming
scale
;
but
,
you
are
aware
that
I
have
,
in
the
course
of
my
*NL*
career
,
surmounted
difficulties
,
and
conquered
obstacles
.
You
are
no
*NL*
stranger
to
the
fact
,
that
there
have
been
periods
of
my
life
,
when
it
*NL*
has
been
requisite
that
I
should
pause
,
until
certain
expected
events
*NL*
should
turn
up
;
when
it
has
been
necessary
that
I
should
fall
back
,
*NL*
before
making
what
I
trust
I
shall
not
be
accused
of
presumption
in
*NL*
terming
--
a
spring
.
The
present
is
one
of
those
momentous
stages
in
the
*NL*
life
of
man
.
You
find
me
,
fallen
back
,
_
for
_
a
spring
;
and
I
have
every
*NL*
reason
to
believe
that
a
vigorous
leap
will
shortly
be
the
result
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
expressing
my
satisfaction
,
when
Mrs.
Micawber
came
in
;
a
little
*NL*
more
slatternly
than
she
used
to
be
,
or
so
she
seemed
now
,
to
my
*NL*
unaccustomed
eyes
,
but
still
with
some
preparation
of
herself
for
*NL*
company
,
and
with
a
pair
of
brown
gloves
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
leading
her
towards
me
.
``
Here
is
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Copperfield
,
who
wishes
to
renew
his
*NL*
acquaintance
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
better
,
as
it
turned
out
,
to
have
led
gently
up
*NL*
to
his
announcement
,
for
Mrs.
Micawber
,
being
in
a
delicate
state
of
*NL*
health
,
was
overcome
by
it
,
and
was
taken
so
unwell
,
that
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
was
obliged
,
in
great
trepidation
,
to
run
down
to
the
water-butt
*NL*
in
the
back
yard
,
and
draw
a
basinful
to
lave
her
brow
with
.
She
*NL*
presently
revived
,
however
,
and
was
really
pleased
to
see
me
.
We
had
*NL*
half-an-hour
's
talk
,
all
together
;
and
I
asked
her
about
the
twins
,
*NL*
who
,
she
said
,
were
``
grown
great
creatures
;
''
and
after
Master
and
Miss
*NL*
Micawber
,
whom
she
described
as
``
absolute
giants
,
''
but
they
were
not
*NL*
produced
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
very
anxious
that
I
should
stay
to
dinner
.
I
should
not
*NL*
have
been
averse
to
do
so
,
but
that
I
imagined
I
detected
trouble
,
and
*NL*
calculation
relative
to
the
extent
of
the
cold
meat
,
in
Mrs.
Micawber
's
*NL*
eye
.
I
therefore
pleaded
another
engagement
;
and
observing
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
's
spirits
were
immediately
lightened
,
I
resisted
all
persuasion
*NL*
to
forego
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
told
Traddles
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
,
that
before
I
could
*NL*
think
of
leaving
,
they
must
appoint
a
day
when
they
would
come
and
dine
*NL*
with
me
.
The
occupations
to
which
Traddles
stood
pledged
,
rendered
it
*NL*
necessary
to
fix
a
somewhat
distant
one
;
but
an
appointment
was
made
for
*NL*
the
purpose
,
that
suited
us
all
,
and
then
I
took
my
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
under
pretence
of
showing
me
a
nearer
way
than
that
by
*NL*
which
I
had
come
,
accompanied
me
to
the
corner
of
the
street
;
being
*NL*
anxious
-LRB-
he
explained
to
me
-RRB-
to
say
a
few
words
to
an
old
friend
,
in
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
I
need
hardly
tell
you
that
*NL*
to
have
beneath
our
roof
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
a
mind
like
that
*NL*
which
gleams
--
if
I
may
be
allowed
the
expression
--
which
gleams
--
in
your
*NL*
friend
Traddles
,
is
an
unspeakable
comfort
.
With
a
washerwoman
,
who
*NL*
exposes
hard-bake
for
sale
in
her
parlor-window
,
dwelling
next
door
,
and
*NL*
a
Bow-street
officer
residing
over
the
way
,
you
may
imagine
that
his
*NL*
society
is
a
source
of
consolation
to
myself
and
to
Mrs.
Micawber
.
I
am
*NL*
at
present
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
engaged
in
the
sale
of
corn
upon
*NL*
commission
.
It
is
not
an
avocation
of
a
remunerative
description
--
in
*NL*
other
words
it
does
_
not
_
pay
--
and
some
temporary
embarrassments
of
a
*NL*
pecuniary
nature
have
been
the
consequence
.
I
am
,
however
,
delighted
to
*NL*
add
that
I
have
now
an
immediate
prospect
of
something
turning
up
-LRB-
I
am
*NL*
not
at
liberty
to
say
in
what
direction
-RRB-
,
which
I
trust
will
enable
me
*NL*
to
provide
,
permanently
,
both
for
myself
and
for
your
friend
Traddles
,
*NL*
in
whom
I
have
an
unaffected
interest
.
You
may
,
perhaps
,
be
prepared
to
*NL*
hear
that
Mrs.
Micawber
is
in
a
state
of
health
which
renders
it
not
*NL*
wholly
improbable
that
an
addition
may
be
ultimately
made
to
those
*NL*
pledges
of
affection
which
--
in
short
,
to
the
infantine
group
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
's
family
have
been
so
good
as
to
express
their
dissatisfaction
*NL*
with
this
state
of
things
.
I
have
merely
to
observe
,
that
I
am
not
aware
*NL*
it
is
any
business
of
theirs
,
and
that
I
repel
that
exhibition
of
*NL*
feeling
with
scorn
,
and
with
defiance
!

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
then
shook
hands
with
me
again
,
and
left
me

CHAPTER
XXVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
MICAWBER
'S
GAUNTLET
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Until
the
day
arrived
on
which
I
was
to
entertain
my
newly-found
old
*NL*
friends
,
I
lived
principally
on
Dora
and
coffee
.
In
my
love-lorn
*NL*
condition
,
my
appetite
languished
;
and
I
was
glad
of
it
,
for
I
felt
as
*NL*
though
it
would
have
been
an
act
of
perfidy
towards
Dora
to
have
a
*NL*
natural
relish
for
my
dinner
.
The
quantity
of
walking
exercise
I
took
,
*NL*
was
not
in
this
respect
attended
with
its
usual
consequence
,
as
the
*NL*
disappointment
counteracted
the
fresh
air
.
I
have
my
doubts
,
too
,
*NL*
founded
on
the
acute
experience
acquired
at
this
period
of
my
life
,
*NL*
whether
a
sound
enjoyment
of
animal
food
can
develop
itself
freely
in
*NL*
any
human
subject
who
is
always
in
torment
from
tight
boots
.
I
think
the
*NL*
extremities
require
to
be
at
peace
before
the
stomach
will
conduct
*NL*
itself
with
vigour
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
occasion
of
this
domestic
little
party
,
I
did
not
repeat
my
*NL*
former
extensive
preparations
.
I
merely
provided
a
pair
of
soles
,
a
*NL*
small
leg
of
mutton
,
and
a
pigeon-pie
.
Mrs.
Crupp
broke
out
into
*NL*
rebellion
on
my
first
bashful
hint
in
reference
to
the
cooking
of
the
*NL*
fish
and
joint
,
and
said
,
with
a
dignified
sense
of
injury
,
``
No
!
No
,
*NL*
sir
!
You
will
not
ask
me
sich
a
thing
,
for
you
are
better
acquainted
*NL*
with
me
than
to
suppose
me
capable
of
doing
what
I
can
not
do
with
ampial
*NL*
satisfaction
to
my
own
feelings
!
''
But
,
in
the
end
,
a
compromise
was
*NL*
effected
;
and
Mrs.
Crupp
consented
to
achieve
this
feat
,
on
condition
*NL*
that
I
dined
from
home
for
a
fortnight
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
I
may
remark
,
that
what
I
underwent
from
Mrs.
Crupp
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
tyranny
she
established
over
me
,
was
dreadful
.
I
*NL*
never
was
so
much
afraid
of
any
one
.
We
made
a
compromise
of
everything
.
*NL*
If
I
hesitated
,
she
was
taken
with
that
wonderful
disorder
which
was
*NL*
always
lying
in
ambush
in
her
system
,
ready
,
at
the
shortest
notice
,
to
*NL*
prey
upon
her
vitals
.
If
I
rang
the
bell
impatiently
,
after
half-a-dozen
*NL*
unavailing
modest
pulls
,
and
she
appeared
at
last
--
which
was
not
by
any
*NL*
means
to
be
relied
upon
--
she
would
appear
with
a
reproachful
aspect
,
*NL*
sink
breathless
on
a
chair
near
the
door
,
lay
her
hand
upon
her
nankeen
*NL*
bosom
,
and
become
so
ill
,
that
I
was
glad
,
at
any
sacrifice
of
brandy
or
*NL*
anything
else
,
to
get
rid
of
her
.
If
I
objected
to
having
my
bed
made
at
*NL*
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
--
which
I
_
do
_
still
think
an
uncomfortable
*NL*
arrangement
--
one
motion
of
her
hand
towards
the
same
nankeen
region
of
*NL*
wounded
sensibility
was
enough
to
make
me
falter
an
apology
.
In
short
,
I
*NL*
would
have
done
anything
in
an
honorable
way
rather
than
give
Mrs.
Crupp
*NL*
offence
;
and
she
was
the
terror
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
bought
a
second-hand
dumb-waiter
for
this
dinner-party
,
in
preference
*NL*
to
re-engaging
the
handy
young
man
;
against
whom
I
had
conceived
a
*NL*
prejudice
,
in
consequence
of
meeting
him
in
the
Strand
,
one
Sunday
*NL*
morning
,
in
a
waistcoat
remarkably
like
one
of
mine
,
which
had
been
*NL*
missing
since
the
former
occasion
.
The
``
young
gal
''
was
re-engaged
;
but
*NL*
on
the
stipulation
that
she
should
only
bring
in
the
dishes
,
and
then
*NL*
withdraw
to
the
landing-place
,
beyond
the
outer
door
;
where
a
habit
of
*NL*
sniffing
she
had
contracted
would
be
lost
upon
the
guests
,
and
where
her
*NL*
retiring
on
the
plates
would
be
a
physical
impossibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
laid
in
the
materials
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
to
be
compounded
by
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
;
having
provided
a
bottle
of
lavender-water
,
two
wax
*NL*
candles
,
a
paper
of
mixed
pins
,
and
a
pincushion
,
to
assist
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
in
her
toilette
,
at
my
dressing-table
;
having
also
caused
the
*NL*
fire
in
my
bed-room
to
be
lighted
for
Mrs.
Micawber
's
convenience
;
and
*NL*
having
laid
the
cloth
with
my
own
hands
,
I
awaited
the
result
with
*NL*
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
time
,
my
three
visitors
arrived
together
.
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
with
more
shirt-collar
than
usual
,
and
a
new
ribbon
to
his
eye-glass
;
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
with
her
cap
in
a
whitey-brown
paper
parcel
;
Traddles
*NL*
carrying
the
parcel
,
and
supporting
Mrs.
Micawber
on
his
arm
.
They
were
*NL*
all
delighted
with
my
residence
.
When
I
conducted
Mrs.
Micawber
to
my
*NL*
dressing-table
,
and
she
saw
the
scale
on
which
it
was
prepared
for
her
,
*NL*
she
was
in
such
raptures
,
that
she
called
Mr.
Micawber
to
come
in
and
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
this
is
luxurious
.
This
is
a
*NL*
way
of
life
which
reminds
me
of
the
period
when
I
was
myself
in
a
state
*NL*
of
celibacy
,
and
Mrs.
Micawber
had
not
yet
been
solicited
to
plight
her
*NL*
faith
at
the
Hymeneal
altar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means
,
solicited
by
him
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
*NL*
archly
.
``
He
can
not
answer
for
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
with
sudden
seriousness
,
``
I
have
no
*NL*
desire
to
answer
for
others
.
I
am
too
well
aware
that
when
,
in
the
*NL*
inscrutable
decrees
of
Fate
,
you
were
reserved
for
me
,
it
is
possible
*NL*
you
may
have
been
reserved
for
one
,
destined
,
after
a
protracted
*NL*
struggle
,
at
length
to
fall
a
victim
to
pecuniary
involvements
of
a
*NL*
complicated
nature
.
I
understand
your
allusion
,
my
love
.
I
regret
it
,
*NL*
but
I
can
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Micawber
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Micawber
,
in
tears
.
``
Have
I
deserved
this
!
I
,
*NL*
who
never
have
deserted
you
;
who
never
_
will
_
desert
you
,
Micawber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
much
affected
,
``
you
will
forgive
,
and
our
*NL*
old
and
tried
friend
Copperfield
will
,
I
am
sure
,
forgive
,
the
momentary
*NL*
laceration
of
a
wounded
spirit
,
made
sensitive
by
a
recent
collision
*NL*
with
the
Minion
of
Power
--
in
other
words
,
with
a
ribald
Turncock
*NL*
attached
to
the
water-works
--
and
will
pity
,
not
condemn
,
its
excesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
then
embraced
Mrs.
Micawber
,
and
pressed
my
hand
;
leaving
*NL*
me
to
infer
from
this
broken
allusion
that
his
domestic
supply
of
water
*NL*
had
been
cut
off
that
afternoon
,
in
consequence
of
default
in
the
*NL*
payment
of
the
company
's
rates
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
divert
his
thoughts
from
this
melancholy
subject
,
I
informed
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
that
I
relied
upon
him
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
led
him
to
the
*NL*
lemons
.
His
recent
despondency
,
not
to
say
despair
,
was
gone
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
I
never
saw
a
man
so
thoroughly
enjoy
himself
amid
the
fragrance
*NL*
of
lemon-peel
and
sugar
,
the
odor
of
burning
rum
,
and
the
steam
of
*NL*
boiling
water
,
as
Mr.
Micawber
did
that
afternoon
.
It
was
wonderful
to
*NL*
see
his
face
shining
at
us
out
of
a
thin
cloud
of
these
delicate
fumes
,
*NL*
as
he
stirred
,
and
mixed
,
and
tasted
,
and
looked
as
if
he
were
making
,
*NL*
instead
of
punch
,
a
fortune
for
his
family
down
to
the
latest
posterity
.
*NL*
As
to
Mrs.
Micawber
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
the
cap
,
*NL*
or
the
lavender-water
,
or
the
pins
,
or
the
fire
,
or
the
wax
candles
,
but
*NL*
she
came
out
of
my
room
,
comparatively
speaking
,
lovely
.
And
the
lark
*NL*
was
never
gayer
than
that
excellent
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
--
I
never
ventured
to
inquire
,
but
I
suppose
--
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Crupp
,
after
frying
the
soles
,
was
taken
ill
.
Because
we
broke
down
*NL*
at
that
point
.
The
leg
of
mutton
came
up
very
red
within
,
and
very
*NL*
pale
without
:
besides
having
a
foreign
substance
of
a
gritty
nature
*NL*
sprinkled
over
it
,
as
if
it
had
had
a
fall
into
the
ashes
of
that
*NL*
remarkable
kitchen
fire-place
.
But
we
were
not
in
a
condition
to
judge
*NL*
of
this
fact
from
the
appearance
of
the
gravy
,
forasmuch
as
the
``
young
*NL*
gal
''
had
dropped
it
all
upon
the
stairs
--
where
it
remained
,
by-the-by
,
*NL*
in
a
long
train
,
until
it
was
worn
out
.
The
pigeon-pie
was
not
bad
,
*NL*
but
it
was
a
delusive
pie
:
the
crust
being
like
a
disappointing
head
,
*NL*
phrenologically
speaking
:
full
of
lumps
and
bumps
,
with
nothing
*NL*
particular
underneath
.
In
short
,
the
banquet
was
such
a
failure
that
I
*NL*
should
have
been
quite
unhappy
--
about
the
failure
,
I
mean
,
for
I
was
*NL*
always
unhappy
about
Dora
--
if
I
had
not
been
relieved
by
the
great
*NL*
good-humour
of
my
company
,
and
by
a
bright
suggestion
from
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
accidents
will
occur
*NL*
in
the
best
regulated
families
;
and
in
families
not
regulated
by
that
*NL*
pervading
influence
which
sanctifies
while
it
enhances
the
--
a
--
I
would
*NL*
say
,
in
short
,
by
the
influence
of
Woman
,
in
the
lofty
character
of
*NL*
Wife
,
they
may
be
expected
with
confidence
,
and
must
be
borne
with
*NL*
philosophy
.
If
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
remarking
that
*NL*
there
are
few
comestibles
better
,
in
their
way
,
than
a
Devil
,
and
that
I
*NL*
believe
,
with
a
little
division
of
labor
,
we
could
accomplish
a
good
one
*NL*
if
the
young
person
in
attendance
could
produce
a
gridiron
,
I
would
put
*NL*
it
to
you
,
that
this
little
misfortune
may
be
easily
repaired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
gridiron
in
the
pantry
,
on
which
my
morning
rasher
of
bacon
*NL*
was
cooked
.
We
had
it
in
,
in
a
twinkling
,
and
immediately
applied
*NL*
ourselves
to
carrying
Mr.
Micawber
's
idea
into
effect
.
The
division
of
*NL*
labor
to
which
he
had
referred
was
this
:
--
Traddles
cut
the
mutton
into
*NL*
slices
;
Mr.
Micawber
-LRB-
who
could
do
anything
of
this
sort
to
perfection
-RRB-
*NL*
covered
them
with
pepper
,
mustard
,
salt
,
and
cayenne
;
I
put
them
on
the
*NL*
gridiron
,
turned
them
with
a
fork
,
and
took
them
off
,
under
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
directions
;
and
Mrs.
Micawber
heated
,
and
continually
*NL*
stirred
,
some
mushroom
ketchup
in
a
little
saucepan
.
When
we
had
slices
*NL*
enough
done
to
begin
upon
,
we
fell-to
,
with
our
sleeves
still
tucked
up
*NL*
at
the
wrists
,
more
slices
sputtering
and
blazing
on
the
fire
,
and
our
*NL*
attention
divided
between
the
mutton
on
our
plates
,
and
the
mutton
then
*NL*
preparing
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
with
the
novelty
of
this
cookery
,
the
excellence
of
it
,
the
bustle
*NL*
of
it
,
the
frequent
starting
up
to
look
after
it
,
the
frequent
sitting
*NL*
down
to
dispose
of
it
as
the
crisp
slices
came
off
the
gridiron
hot
and
*NL*
hot
,
the
being
so
busy
,
so
flushed
with
the
fire
,
so
amused
,
and
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
such
a
tempting
noise
and
savor
,
we
reduced
the
leg
of
mutton
*NL*
to
the
bone
.
My
own
appetite
came
back
miraculously
.
I
am
ashamed
to
*NL*
record
it
,
but
I
really
believe
I
forgot
Dora
for
a
little
while
.
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
could
not
have
enjoyed
the
feast
*NL*
more
if
they
had
sold
a
bed
to
provide
it
.
Traddles
laughed
as
heartily
,
*NL*
almost
the
whole
time
,
as
he
ate
and
worked
.
Indeed
we
all
did
,
all
at
*NL*
once
;
and
I
dare
say
there
never
was
a
greater
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
at
the
height
of
our
enjoyment
,
and
were
all
busily
engaged
,
in
*NL*
our
several
departments
,
endeavouring
to
bring
the
last
batch
of
slices
*NL*
to
a
state
of
perfection
that
should
crown
the
feast
,
when
I
was
aware
*NL*
of
a
strange
presence
in
the
room
,
and
my
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
*NL*
staid
Littimer
,
standing
hat
in
hand
before
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
!
''
I
involuntarily
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
was
directed
to
come
in
.
Is
my
master
not
*NL*
here
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
seen
him

sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

do

come
from
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
immediately
so
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
tell
you
you
would
find
him
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
so
,
sir
.
But
I
should
think
he
might
be
here
to-morrow
,
as
*NL*
he
has
not
been
here
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
coming
up
from
Oxford
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
,
sir
,
''
he
returned
respectfully
,
``
that
you
will
be
seated
,
and
*NL*
allow
me
to
do
this
.
''
With
which
he
took
the
fork
from
my
unresisting
*NL*
hand
,
and
bent
over
the
gridiron
,
as
if
his
whole
attention
were
*NL*
concentrated
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
should
not
have
been
much
discomposed
,
I
dare
say
,
by
the
appearance
*NL*
of
Steerforth
himself
,
but
we
became
in
a
moment
the
meekest
of
the
*NL*
meek
before
his
respectable
serving-man
.
Mr.
Micawber
,
humming
a
tune
,
*NL*
to
show
that
he
was
quite
at
ease
,
subsided
into
his
chair
,
with
the
*NL*
handle
of
a
hastily-concealed
fork
sticking
out
of
the
bosom
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
as
if
he
had
stabbed
himself
.
Mrs.
Micawber
put
on
her
brown
*NL*
gloves
,
and
assumed
a
genteel
languor
.
Traddles
ran
his
greasy
hands
*NL*
through
his
hair
,
and
stood
it
bolt
upright
,
and
stared
in
confusion
at
*NL*
the
table-cloth
.
As
for
me
,
I
was
a
mere
infant
at
the
head
of
my
own
*NL*
table
;
and
hardly
ventured
to
glance
at
the
respectable
phenomenon
,
who
*NL*
had
come
from
Heaven
knows
where
,
to
put
my
establishment
to
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
took
the
mutton
off
the
gridiron
,
and
gravely
handed
it
*NL*
round
.
We
all
took
some
,
but
our
appreciation
of
it
was
gone
,
and
we
*NL*
merely
made
a
show
of
eating
it
.
As
we
severally
pushed
away
our
plates
,
*NL*
he
noiselessly
removed
them
,
and
set
on
the
cheese
.
He
took
that
off
,
*NL*
too
,
when
it
was
done
with
;
cleared
the
table
;
piled
everything
on
the
*NL*
dumb-waiter
;
gave
us
our
wine-glasses
;
and
,
of
his
own
accord
,
wheeled
*NL*
the
dumb-waiter
into
the
pantry
.
All
this
was
done
in
a
perfect
manner
,
*NL*
and
he
never
raised
his
eyes
from
what
he
was
about
.
Yet
,
his
very
*NL*
elbows
,
when
he
had
his
back
towards
me
,
seemed
to
teem
with
the
*NL*
expression
of
his
fixed
opinion
that
I
was
extremely
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
do
anything
more
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
and
said
,
No
;
but
would
he
take
no
dinner
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Steerforth
coming
from
Oxford
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Steerforth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
imagine
that
he
might
be
here
to-morrow
,
sir
.
I
rather
thought
*NL*
he
might
have
been
here
to-day
,
sir
.
The
mistake
is
mine
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
should
see
him
first

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
excuse
me
,
sir

I
do
n't
think
I
shall
see
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
case
you
do

''
said
I
,
``
pray
say
that
I
am
sorry
he
was
not
here
*NL*
to-day

as
an
old
schoolfellow
of
his
was
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
!
''
and
he
divided
a
bow
between
me
and
Traddles
,
with
a
*NL*
glance
at
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
moving
softly
to
the
door
,
when
,
in
a
forlorn
hope
of
saying
*NL*
something
naturally
--
which
I
never
could
,
to
this
man
--
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Littimer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
remain
long
at
Yarmouth
,
that
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
particularly
so
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
the
boat
completed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
I
remained
behind
on
purpose
to
see
the
boat
completed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
!
''
He
raised
his
eyes
to
mine
respectfully
.
``
Mr.
Steerforth
has
*NL*
not
seen
it
yet
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
ca
n't
say
,
sir
.
I
think
--
but
I
really
ca
n't
say
,
sir
.
I
wish
*NL*
you
good
night
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
comprehended
everybody
present
,
in
the
respectful
bow
with
which
he
*NL*
followed
these
words
,
and
disappeared
.
My
visitors
seemed
to
breathe
*NL*
more
freely
when
he
was
gone
;
but
my
own
relief
was
very
great
,
for
*NL*
besides
the
constraint
,
arising
from
that
extraordinary
sense
of
being
*NL*
at
a
disadvantage
which
I
always
had
in
this
man
's
presence
,
my
*NL*
conscience
had
embarrassed
me
with
whispers
that
I
had
mistrusted
his
*NL*
master
,
and
I
could
not
repress
a
vague
uneasy
dread
that
he
might
find
*NL*
it
out
.
How
was
it
,
having
so
little
in
reality
to
conceal
,
that
I
*NL*
always
_
did
_
feel
as
if
this
man
were
finding
me
out
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
roused
me
from
this
reflection
,
which
was
blended
with
a
*NL*
certain
remorseful
apprehension
of
seeing
Steerforth
himself
,
by
*NL*
bestowing
many
encomiums
on
the
absent
Littimer
as
a
most
respectable
*NL*
fellow
,
and
a
thoroughly
admirable
servant
.
Mr.
Micawber
,
I
may
remark
,
*NL*
had
taken
his
full
share
of
the
general
bow
,
and
had
received
it
with
*NL*
infinite
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
punch
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
tasting
it
,
``
like
*NL*
time
and
tide
,
waits
for
no
man
.
Ah
!
it
is
at
the
present
moment
in
high
*NL*
flavor
.
My
love
,
will
you
give
me
your
opinion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
pronounced
it
excellent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
drink
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
if
my
friend
Copperfield
will
*NL*
permit
me
to
take
that
social
liberty
,
to
the
days
when
my
friend
*NL*
Copperfield
and
myself
were
younger
,
and
fought
our
way
in
the
world
*NL*
side
by
side
.
I
may
say
,
of
myself
and
Copperfield
,
in
words
we
have
*NL*
sung
together
before
now
,
that
*NL*

twa

hae
run
about
the
braes

pu
'd
the
gowans
fine
*NL*

--
in
a
figurative
point
of
view
--
on
several
occasions
.
I
am
not
exactly
*NL*
aware

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
the
old
roll
in
his
voice
,
and
the
old
*NL*
indescribable
air
of
saying
something
genteel
,
``
what
gowans
may
be
,
but
*NL*
I
have
no
doubt
that
Copperfield
and
myself
would
frequently
have
taken
*NL*
a
pull
at
them
,
if
it
had
been
feasible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
at
the
then
present
moment
,
took
a
pull
at
his
punch
.
So
*NL*
we
all
did
:
Traddles
evidently
lost
in
wondering
at
what
distant
time
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
and
I
could
possibly
have
been
comrades
in
the
battle
of
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ahem
!
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
clearing
his
throat
,
and
warming
with
the
*NL*
punch
and
with
the
fire
.
``
My
dear
,
another
glass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
said
it
must
be
very
little
,
but
we
could
n't
allow
that
,
*NL*
so
it
was
a
glassful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
are
quite
confidential
here
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
sipping
her
punch
,
``
Mr.
Traddles
being
a
part
of
our
*NL*
domesticity
,
I
should
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
on
Mr.
Micawber
's
*NL*
prospects
.
For
corn
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
argumentatively
,
``
as
I
have
*NL*
repeatedly
said
to
Mr.
Micawber
,
may
be
gentlemanly
,
but
it
is
not
*NL*
remunerative
.
Commission
to
the
extent
of
two
and
ninepence
in
a
*NL*
fortnight
can
not
,
however
limited
our
ideas
,
be
considered
*NL*
remunerative
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
agreed
upon
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
who
prided
herself
on
taking
a
clear
view
of
*NL*
things
,
and
keeping
Mr.
Micawber
straight
by
her
woman
's
wisdom
,
when
he
*NL*
might

turned

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
eyed
us
aside
,
and
nodded
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
case
was
*NL*
very
clearly
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
still
more
*NL*
argumentatively
,
``
being
equally
out
of

Mr.

naturally

What
is
there
in

is
likely
to
succeed

And
I
exclude
the
*NL*
doing
anything
on

,
because
commission
is
not
a

*NL*
What
is
best
suited
to
a

is
,
I
am
convinced

a
certainty

*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
and
I
both
expressed
,
by
a
feeling
murmur
,
that
this
great
*NL*
discovery
was
no
doubt
true
of
Mr.
Micawber
,
and
that
it
did
him
much
*NL*
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
conceal
from
you

my

said
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
``
that
_
I

have

*NL*
*NL*

My

said
Mrs.

laying

on

``
I
may
have
a
conviction

Mr.

that
Mr.

*NL*
manners
peculiarly
qualify
him
for
the
Banking
business

I
may
argue
*NL*
within
myself
,
that
if
_
I
_
had
a
deposit
at
a
banking-house
,
the
*NL*
manners
of
Mr.
Micawber
,
as
representing
that
banking-house
,
would
*NL*
inspire
confidence

and
must
extend
the

But
if
the

banking-houses
refuse
to

them

None

As
to
originating
a

*NL*
I
may
know
that
there
are
members

,
if
they
chose
to
*NL*
place
their
money
in
Mr.

might
found
an
establishment
*NL*
of
that
description

But
if

choose
to
place
their
money
*NL*
in
Mr.

hands
--
which
they
do

what
is
the
use

that
?
*NL*
Again
I
contend
that
we
are
no
farther
advanced
than
we
were
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
,
and
said
,
``
Not
a
bit

''
Traddles
also
shook
his
head
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Not
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
deduce
from
this
?
''
Mrs.
Micawber
went
on
to
say
,
still
with
*NL*
the
same
air
of
putting
a
case
lucidly
.
``
What
is
the
conclusion

my

*NL*
Mr.

to
which
I
am
irresistibly

I
wrong
in
*NL*
saying

is
clear
that
we
must
live

*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
``
Not
at

!
''
and
Traddles
answered
,
``
Not
at
all

''
and
I
*NL*
found
myself
afterwards
sagely
adding
,
alone
,
that
a

must
either
*NL*
live
or
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
It
is
precisely
that
.
And
the
fact

is

my

,
that
we
can
_
not
_
live
without
something
*NL*
widely
different
from
existing
circumstances
shortly
turning
up

Now
I
*NL*
am
convinced

myself

this
I
have
pointed
out
to
Mr.

several
times

that
things

assist

up

have
formed

*NL*
Both
Traddles
and
I
applauded
it
highly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

said
Mrs.

forcibly

I
ventured

how
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

*NL*
Mr.

leaning

trifled
with
his

*NL*
cast
his
eyes
up
at

I
thought
him
observant

who
was
looking
at
the
fire

``

said
Mrs.
Micawber

``
is
possessed
of

sufficient
natural
feeling

believe
there
is
a

to

I
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
with

still
cast
up

suggested
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
discount
that

said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
then
my
opinion
is

that

Mr.

should
go
into

should
take
that

the
*NL*
Money
Market

should
dispose
of
it

If
the

oblige
Mr.

that
is

view

I
recommend
Mr.

my

to
do
the

;
to
regard
it
as
an
investment
which
is
sure
*NL*
of
return
,
and
to
make
up
his
mind
to
_
any
_
sacrifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
,
but
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
why
,
that
this
was
self-denying
and
*NL*
devoted
in
Mrs.
Micawber
,
and
I
uttered
a
murmur
to
that
effect
.
*NL*
Traddles
,
who
took
his
tone
from
me
,
did
likewise
,
still
looking
at
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
finishing
her
punch
,
and
gathering
her
*NL*
scarf
about
her
shoulders
,
preparatory
to
her
withdrawal
to
my
bedroom
:
*NL*
``
I
will
not
protract
these
remarks
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Micawber

*NL*
pecuniary
affairs
.
At
your
fireside
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
and
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
Mr.
Traddles
,
who
,
though
not
so
old
a
friend
,
is
quite
one
*NL*
of
ourselves
,
I
could
not
refrain
from
making
you
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
course
_
I
_
advise
Mr.
Micawber
to
take
.
I
feel
that
the
time
is
arrived
*NL*
when
Mr.
Micawber
should
exert
himself
and
--
I
will
add
--
assert
himself
,
*NL*
and
it
appears
to
me
that
these
are
the
means
.
I
am
aware
that
I
am
*NL*
merely
a
female
,
and
that
a
masculine
judgment
is
usually
considered
*NL*
more
competent
to
the
discussion
of
such
questions
;
still
I
must
not
*NL*
forget
that
,
when
I
lived
at
home
with
my
papa
and
mama
,
my
papa
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
saying
,
'Em
ma
's
form
is
fragile
,
but
her
grasp
of
a
subject
*NL*
is
inferior
to
none
.
'
That
my
papa
was
too
partial
,
I
well
know
;
but
*NL*
that
he
was
an
observer
of
character
in
some
degree
,
my
duty
and
my
*NL*
reason
equally
forbid
me
to
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
and
resisting
our
entreaties
that
she
would
grace
*NL*
the
remaining
circulation
of
the
punch
with
her
presence
,
Mrs.
Micawber
*NL*
retired
to
my
bed-room
.
And
really
I
felt
that
she
was
a
noble
*NL*
woman
--
the
sort
of
woman
who
might
have
been
a
Roman
matron
,
and
done
*NL*
all
manner
of
heroic
things
,
in
times
of
public
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fervor
of
this
impression
,
I
congratulated
Mr.
Micawber
on
the
*NL*
treasure
he
possessed
.
So
did
Traddles
.
Mr.
Micawber
extended
his
*NL*
hand
to
each
of
us
in
succession
,
and
then
covered
his
face
with
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
,
which
I
think
had
more
snuff
upon
it
than
he
*NL*
was
aware
of
.
He
then
returned
to
the
punch
,
in
the
highest
state
of
*NL*
exhilaration
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
full
of
eloquence
.
He
gave
us
to
understand
that
in
our
children
*NL*
we
lived
again
,
and
that
,
under
the
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulties
,
*NL*
any
accession
to
their
number
was
doubly
welcome
.
He
said
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
had
latterly
had
her
doubts
on
this
point
,
but
that
he
had
*NL*
dispelled
them
,
and
reassured
her
.
As
to
her
family
,
they
were
totally
*NL*
unworthy
of
her
,
and
their
sentiments
were
utterly
indifferent
to
him
,
*NL*
and
they
might
--
I
quote
his
own
expression
--
go
to
the
Devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
then
delivered
a
warm
eulogy
on
Traddles
.
He
said
*NL*
Traddles
's
was
a
character
,
to
the
steady
virtues
of
which
he
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
-RRB-
could
lay
no
claim
,
but
which
,
he
thanked
Heaven
,
he
could
*NL*
admire
.
He
feelingly
alluded
to
the
young
lady
,
unknown
,
whom
Traddles
*NL*
had
honored
with
his
affection
,
and
who
had
reciprocated
that
affection
*NL*
by
honoring
and
blessing
Traddles
with
_
her
_
affection
.
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
pledged
her
.
So
did
I.
Traddles
thanked
us
both
,
by
saying
,
with
a
*NL*
simplicity
and
honesty
I
had
sense
enough
to
be
quite
charmed
with
,
``
I
*NL*
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
.
And
I
do
assure
you
,
she
's
the
*NL*
dearest
girl
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
took
an
early
opportunity
,
after
that
,
of
hinting
,
with
the
*NL*
utmost
delicacy
and
ceremony
,
at
the
state
of
_
my
_
affections
.
Nothing
*NL*
but
the
serious
assurance
of
his
friend
Copperfield
to
the
contrary
,
he
*NL*
observed
,
could
deprive
him
of
the
impression
that
his
friend
*NL*
Copperfield
loved
and
was
beloved
.
After
feeling
very
hot
and
*NL*
uncomfortable
for
some
time
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
blushing
,
*NL*
stammering
,
and
denying
,
I
said
,
having
my
glass
in
my
hand
,
``
Well
!
I
*NL*
would
give
them
D.
!
''
which
so
excited
and
gratified
Mr.
Micawber
,
that
*NL*
he
ran
with
a
glass
of
punch
into
my
bed-room
,
in
order
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
might
drink
D.
,
who
drank
it
with
enthusiasm
,
crying
from
*NL*
within
,
in
a
shrill
voice
,
``
Hear
,
hear
!
My
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
I
am
*NL*
delighted
.
Hear
!
''
and
tapping
at
the
wall
,
by
way
of
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
conversation
,
afterwards
,
took
a
more
worldly
turn
;
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
telling
us
that
he
found
Camden
Town
inconvenient
,
and
that
the
first
*NL*
thing
he
contemplated
doing
,
when
the
advertisement
should
have
been
the
*NL*
cause
of
something
satisfactory
turning
up
,
was
to
move
.
He
mentioned
a
*NL*
terrace
at
the
western
end
of
Oxford
Street
,
fronting
Hyde
Park
,
on
*NL*
which
he
had
always
had
his
eye
,
but
which
he
did
not
expect
to
attain
*NL*
immediately
,
as
it
would
require
a
large
establishment
.
There
would
*NL*
probably
be
an
interval
,
he
explained
,
in
which
he
should
content
*NL*
himself
with
the
upper
part
of
a
house
,
over
some
respectable
place
of
*NL*
business
,
--
say
in
Piccadilly
,
--
which
would
be
a
cheerful
situation
for
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
;
and
where
,
by
throwing
out
a
bow
window
,
or
carrying
up
*NL*
the
roof
another
story
,
or
making
some
little
alteration
of
that
sort
,
*NL*
they
might
live
,
comfortably
and
reputably
,
for
a
few
years
.
Whatever
*NL*
was
reserved
for
him
,
he
expressly
said
,
or
wherever
his
abode
might
be
,
*NL*
we
might
rely
on
this
--
there
would
always
be
a
room
for
Traddles
,
and
a
*NL*
knife
and
fork
for
me
.
We
acknowledged
his
kindness
;
and
he
begged
us
to
*NL*
forgive
his
having
launched
into
these
practical
and
business-like
*NL*
details
,
and
to
excuse
it
as
natural
in
one
who
was
making
entirely
new
*NL*
arrangements
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
,
tapping
at
the
wall
again
,
to
know
if
tea
were
ready
,
*NL*
broke
up
this
particular
phase
of
our
friendly
conversation
.
She
made
*NL*
tea
for
us
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
;
and
,
whenever
I
went
near
her
,
in
*NL*
handing
about
the
tea-cups
and
bread-and-butter
,
asked
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
*NL*
whether
D.
was
fair
,
or
dark
,
or
whether
she
was
short
,
or
tall
:
or
*NL*
something
of
that
kind
;
which
I
think
I
liked
.
After
tea
,
we
discussed
a
*NL*
variety
of
topics
before
the
fire
;
and
Mrs.
Micawber
was
good
enough
to
*NL*
sing
us
-LRB-
in
a
small
,
thin
,
flat
voice
,
which
I
remember
to
have
*NL*
considered
,
when
I
first
knew
her
,
the
very
table-beer
of
acoustics
-RRB-
the
*NL*
favorite
ballads
of
``
The
Dashing
White
Serjeant
,
''
and
``
Little
Tafflin
.
''
*NL*
For
both
of
these
songs
Mrs.
Micawber
had
been
famous
when
she
lived
at
*NL*
home
with
her
papa
and
mama
.
Mr.
Micawber
told
us
,
that
when
he
heard
*NL*
her
sing
the
first
one
,
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
seeing
her
beneath
*NL*
the
parental
roof
,
she
had
attracted
his
attention
in
an
extraordinary
*NL*
degree
;
but
that
when
it
came
to
Little
Tafflin
,
he
had
resolved
to
win
*NL*
that
woman
or
perish
in
the
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
when
Mrs.
Micawber
rose
to
replace
*NL*
her
cap
in
the
whitey-brown
paper
parcel
,
and
to
put
on
her
bonnet
.
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
took
the
opportunity
of
Traddles
putting
on
his
great
coat
,
to
*NL*
slip
a
letter
into
my
hand
,
with
a
whispered
request
that
I
would
read
*NL*
it
at
my
leisure
.
I
also
took
the
opportunity
of
my
holding
a
candle
*NL*
over
the
bannisters
to
light
them
down
,
when
Mr.
Micawber
was
going
*NL*
first
,
leading
Mrs.
Micawber
,
and
Traddles
was
following
with
the
cap
,
*NL*
to
detain
Traddles
for
a
moment
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Traddles
,
''
said
I
,
``
Mr.
Micawber
do
n't
mean
any
harm
,
poor
fellow
;
but
,
*NL*
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
n't
lend
him
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Traddles
,
smiling
,
``
I
have
n't
got
*NL*
anything
to
lend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
got
a
name
,
you
know
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
call
_
that
_
something
to
lend
?
''
returned
Traddles
,
with
a
*NL*
thoughtful
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Traddles
.
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
!
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
*NL*
Copperfield
;
but
--
I
am
afraid
I
have
lent
him
that
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
bill
that
is
to
be
a
certain
investment
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
Not
for
that
one
.
This
is
the
first
I
have
heard
*NL*
of
that
one
.
I
have
been
thinking
that
he
will
most
likely
propose
that
*NL*
one
,
on
the
way
home
.
Mine
's
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
there
will
be
nothing
wrong
about
it
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
I
should
think
not
,
though
,
because
he
*NL*
told
me
,
only
the
other
day
,
that
it
was
provided
for
.
That
was
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
expression
.
`
Provided
for
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
looking
up
at
this
juncture
to
where
we
were
standing
,
I
*NL*
had
only
time
to
repeat
my
caution
.
Traddles
thanked
me
,
and
descended
.
*NL*
But
I
was
much
afraid
,
when
I
observed
the
good-natured
manner
in
which
*NL*
he
went
down
with
the
cap
in
his
hand
,
and
gave
Mrs.
Micawber
his
arm
,
*NL*
that
he
would
be
carried
into
the
Money
Market
neck
and
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
to
my
fireside
,
and
was
musing
,
half
gravely
and
half
*NL*
laughing
,
on
the
character
of
Mr.
Micawber
and
the
old
relations
between
*NL*
us
,
when
I
heard
a
quick
step
ascending
the
stairs
.
At
first
,
I
thought
*NL*
it
was
Traddles
coming
back
for
something
Mrs.
Micawber
had
left
behind
;
*NL*
but
as
the
step
approached
,
I
knew
it
,
and
felt
my
heart
beat
high
,
and
*NL*
the
blood
rush
to
my
face
,
for
it
was
Steerforth
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
never
unmindful
of
Agnes
,
and
she
never
left
that
sanctuary
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
--
if
I
may
call
it
so
--
where
I
had
placed
her
from
the
first
.
*NL*
But
when
he
entered
,
and
stood
before
me
with
his
hand
out
,
the
darkness
*NL*
that
had
fallen
on
him
changed
to
light
,
and
I
felt
confounded
and
*NL*
ashamed
of
having
doubted
one
I
loved
so
heartily
.
I
loved
her
none
the
*NL*
less
;
I
thought
of
her
as
the
same
benignant
,
gentle
angel
in
my
life
;
I
*NL*
reproached
myself
,
not
her
,
with
having
done
him
an
injury
;
and
I
would
*NL*
have
made
him
any
atonement
if
I
had
known
what
to
make
,
and
how
to
make
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Daisy
,
old
boy
,
dumb-foundered
!
''
laughed
Steerforth
,
shaking
my
*NL*
hand
heartily
,
and
throwing
it
gaily
away
.
``
Have
I
detected
you
in
*NL*
another
feast
,
you
Sybarite
!
These
Doctors
'
Commons
fellows
are
the
*NL*
gayest
men
in
town
,
I
believe
,
and
beat
us
sober
Oxford
people
all
to
*NL*
nothing
!
''
His
bright
glance
went
merrily
round
the
room
,
as
he
took
the
*NL*
seat
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
me
,
which
Mrs.
Micawber
had
recently
*NL*
vacated
,
and
stirred
the
fire
into
a
blaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
surprised
at
first
,
''
said
I
,
giving
him
welcome
with
all
the
*NL*
cordiality
I
felt
,
``
that
I
had
hardly
breath
to
greet
you
with
,
*NL*
Steerforth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
sight
of
me
_
is
_
good
for
sore
eyes
,
as
the
Scotch
say
,
''
*NL*
replied
Steerforth
,
``
and
so
is
the
sight
of
you
,
Daisy
,
in
full
bloom
.
*NL*
How
are
you
,
my
Bacchanal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
well
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
not
at
all
Bacchanalian
to-night
,
though
*NL*
I
confess
to
another
party
of
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
of
whom
I
met
in
the
street
,
talking
loud
in
your
praise
,
''
returned
*NL*
Steerforth
.
``
Who
's
our
friend
in
the
tights
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
the
best
idea
I
could
,
in
a
few
words
,
of
Mr.
Micawber
.
He
*NL*
laughed
heartily
at
my
feeble
portrait
of
that
gentleman
,
and
said
he
*NL*
was
a
man
to
know
,
and
he
must
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
do
you
suppose
our
other
friend
is
?
''
said
I
,
in
my
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
knows
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Not
a
bore
,
I
hope
?
I
thought
he
*NL*
looked
a
little
like
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Traddles
!
''
I
replied
,
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
he
?
''
asked
Steerforth
,
in
his
careless
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
remember
Traddles
?
Traddles
in
our
room
at
Salem
House
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
That
fellow
!
''
said
Steerforth
,
beating
a
lump
of
coal
on
the
top
of
*NL*
the
fire
,
with
the
poker
.
``
Is
he
as
soft
as
ever
?
And
where
the
deuce
*NL*
did
you
pick
_
him
_
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
extolled
Traddles
in
reply
,
as
highly
as
I
could
;
for
I
felt
that
*NL*
Steerforth
rather
slighted
him
.
Steerforth
,
dismissing
the
subject
with
*NL*
a
light
nod
,
and
a
smile
,
and
the
remark
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
*NL*
the
old
fellow
too
,
for
he
had
always
been
an
odd
fish
,
inquired
if
I
*NL*
could
give
him
anything
to
eat
?
During
most
of
this
short
dialogue
,
when
*NL*
he
had
not
been
speaking
in
a
wild
vivacious
manner
,
he
had
sat
idly
*NL*
beating
on
the
lump
of
coal
with
the
poker
.
I
observed
that
he
did
the
*NL*
same
thing
while
I
was
getting
out
the
remains
of
the
pigeon-pie
,
and
so
*NL*
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Daisy
,
here
's
a
supper
for
a
king
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
starting
out
of
*NL*
his
silence
with
a
burst
,
and
taking
his
seat
at
the
table
.
``
I
shall
do
*NL*
it
justice
,
for
I
have
come
from
Yarmouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
came
from
Oxford

''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I

''
said
Steerforth
.
``

have
been
seafaring

better
employed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Littimer
was
here
to-day

I
remarked
,
``

understood
him
that
you
were

now
I
think
of
it

certainly
did
not
say
so

*NL*
*NL*
``

a
greater
fool

I
thought
him

said
Steerforth
,
jovially
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
*NL*
and
drinking
to
me
.
``
As
to
understanding
him
,
you
are
a
cleverer

can
do
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

indeed

said
I
,
moving
my
chair
to
the
table
.
``
So
you

have
been
at
Yarmouth

interested
to
know
all
about
it

*NL*
``
Have
you
been
there
long
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
returned

he
laid

down
his
knife
and
fork
,
which
he
had
been
using
with
great
diligence

and
began
feeling
in

*NL*
*NL*
``

still
feeling
in
his

looking
over
their
contents
:
*NL*
``
it
's
all
over

surgeon

who
brought

learned

the
upshot

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
from
Peggotty
;
something
less
legible
than
usual

brief
.
It
*NL*
informed
me
of
her
husband
's
hopeless
state
,
and
hinted
at
his
being
``
a
*NL*
little
nearer
''
than
heretofore
,
and
consequently
more
difficult
to
*NL*
manage
for
his
own
comfort
.
It
said
nothing
of
her
weariness
and
*NL*
watching
,
and
praised
him
highly
.
It
was
written
with
a
plain
,
*NL*
unaffected
,
homely
piety
that
I
knew
to
be
genuine
,
and
ended
with
``
my
*NL*
duty
to
my
ever
darling
''
--
meaning
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
deciphered
it
,
Steerforth
continued
to
eat
and
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bad
job
,
''
he
said
,
when
I
had
done
;
``
but
the
sun
sets
every
day
,
*NL*
and
people
die
every
minute
,
and
we
must
n't
be
scared
by
the
common
lot
.
*NL*
If
we
failed
to
hold
our
own
,
because
that
equal
foot
at
all
men
's
doors
*NL*
was
heard
knocking
somewhere
,
every
object
in
this
world
would
slip
from
*NL*
us
.
No
!
Ride
on
!
Rough-shod
if
need
be
,
smooth-shod
if
that
will
do
,
but
*NL*
ride
on
!
Ride
over
all
obstacles
,
and
win
the
race
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
win
what
race
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
race
that
one
has
started
in
,
''
said
he
.
``
Ride
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
noticed
,
I
remember
,
as
he
paused
,
looking
at
me
with
his
handsome
*NL*
head
a
little
thrown
back
,
and
his
glass
raised
in
his
hand
,
that
,
*NL*
though
the
freshness
of
the
sea-wind
was
on
his
face
,
and
it
was
ruddy
,
*NL*
there
were
traces
in
it
,
made
since
I
last
saw
it
,
as
if
he
had
applied
*NL*
himself
to
some
habitual
strain
of
the
fervent
energy
which
,
when
*NL*
roused
,
was
so
passionately
roused
within
him
.
I
had
it
in
my
thoughts
*NL*
to
remonstrate
with
him
upon
his
desperate
way
of
pursuing
any
fancy
*NL*
that
he
took
--
such
as
this
buffetting
of
rough
seas
,
and
braving
of
hard
*NL*
weather
,
for
example
--
when
my
mind
glanced
off
to
the
immediate
subject
*NL*
of
our
conversation
again
,
and
pursued
that
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
,
Steerforth
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
your
high
spirits
will
listen
*NL*
to
me
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
potent
spirits
,
and
will
do
whatever
you
like
,
''
he
answered
,
*NL*
moving
from
the
table
to
the
fireside
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
tell
you
what
,
Steerforth
.
I
think
I
will
go
down
and
see
my
old
*NL*
nurse
.
It
is
not
that
I
can
do
her
any
good
,
or
render
her
any
real
*NL*
service
;
but
she
is
so
attached
to
me
that
my
visit
will
have
as
much
*NL*
effect
on
her
,
as
if
I
could
do
both
.
She
will
take
it
so
kindly
that
it
*NL*
will
be
a
comfort
and
support
to
her
.
It
is
no
great
effort
to
make
,
I
*NL*
am
sure
,
for
such
a
friend
as
she
has
been
to
me
.
Would
n't
you
go
a
*NL*
day
's
journey
,
if
you
were
in
my
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
thoughtful
,
and
he
sat
considering
a
little
before
he
*NL*
answered
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Well
!
Go
.
You
can
do
no
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
just
come
back
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
it
would
be
in
vain
to
ask
you
*NL*
to
go
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,
''
he
returned
.
``
I
am
for
Highgate
to-night
.
I
have
not
seen
*NL*
my
mother
this
long
time
,
and
it
lies
upon
my
conscience
,
for
*NL*
it
's
something
to
be
loved
as
she
loves
her
prodigal
son
.
--
Bah
!
*NL*
Nonsense
!
--
You
mean
to
go
to-morrow
,
I
suppose
?
''
he
said
,
holding
me
*NL*
out
at
arm
's
length
,
with
a
hand
on
each
of
my
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
do
n't
go
till
next

I
wanted
you
to
come
and
stay
a
few

days
with
us
.
Here
I
am
,
on
purpose
to
bid
you

you
fly
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are

are
always

running
wild

some
unknown
expedition
or
other
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
without
speaking
,
and
then
rejoined
,
still
*NL*
holding
me
as
before
,
and
giving
me
a
shake
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Say
the
next

pass
as
much
of
to-morrow

you
can
with

Who

may
meet
again

else
?
Come

Say
the

!
I
*NL*
want
you
to
stand
between
Rosa
Dartle
and
me
,
and
keep
us
asunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
love
each
other
too
much
,
without
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
or
hate
,
''
laughed
Steerforth
;
``
no
matter
which
.
Come
!
Say
the
next
*NL*
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
the
next
day
;
and
he
put
on
his
great-coat
,
and
lighted
his
*NL*
cigar
,
and
set
off
to
walk
home
.
Finding
him
in
this
intention
,
I
put
on
*NL*
my
own
great-coat
-LRB-
but
did
not
light
my
own
cigar
,
having
had
enough
of
*NL*
that
for
one
while
-RRB-
and
walked
with
him
as
far
as
the
open
road
:
a
dull
*NL*
road
,
then
,
at
night
.
He
was
in
great
spirits
all
the
way
;
and
when
we
*NL*
parted
,
and
I
looked
after
him
going
so
gallantly
and
airily
homeward
,
I
*NL*
thought
of
his
saying
,
``
Ride
on
over
all
obstacles
,
and
win
the
race
!
''
*NL*
and
wished
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
had
some
worthy
race
to
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
undressing
in
my
own
room
,
when
Mr.
Micawber
's
letter
tumbled
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
Thus
reminded
of
it
,
I
broke
the
seal
and
read
as
follows
.
It
*NL*
was
dated
an
hour
and
a
half
before
dinner
.
I
am
not
sure
whether
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
that
,
when
Mr.
Micawber
was
at
any
particularly
desperate
*NL*
crisis
,
he
used
a
sort
of
legal
phraseology
:
which
he
seemed
to
think
*NL*
equivalent
to
winding
up
his
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XXIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
VISIT
STEERFORTH
AT
HIS
HOME
,
AGAIN
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
to
Mr.
Spenlow
in
the
morning
,
that
I
wanted
leave
of
*NL*
absence
for
a
short
time
;
and
as
I
was
not
in
the
receipt
of
any
salary
,
*NL*
and
consequently
was
not
obnoxious
to
the
implacable
Jorkins
,
there
was
*NL*
no
difficulty
about
it
.
I
took
that
opportunity
,
with
my
voice
sticking
*NL*
in
my
throat
,
and
my
sight
failing
as
I
uttered
the
words
,
to
express
my
*NL*
hope
that
Miss
Spenlow
was
quite
well
;
to
which
Mr.
Spenlow
replied
,
*NL*
with
no
more
emotion
than
if
he
had
been
speaking
of
an
ordinary
human
*NL*
being
,
that
he
was
much
obliged
to
me
,
and
she
was
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
articled
clerks
,
as
germs
of
the
patrician
order
of
proctors
,
were
*NL*
treated
with
so
much
consideration
,
that
I
was
almost
my
own
master
at
*NL*
all
times
.
As
I
did
not
care
,
however
,
to
get
to
Highgate
before
one
or
*NL*
two
o'clock
in
the
day
,
and
as
we
had
another
little
excommunication
*NL*
case
in
court
that
morning
,
which
was
called
The
office
of
the
Judge
*NL*
promoted
by
Tipkins
against
Bullock
for
his
soul
's
correction
,
I
passed
*NL*
an
hour
or
two
in
attendance
on
it
with
Mr.
Spenlow
very
agreeably
.
It
*NL*
arose
out
of
a
scuffle
between
two
churchwardens
,
one
of
whom
was
*NL*
alleged
to
have
pushed
the
other
against
a
pump
;
the
handle
of
which
*NL*
pump
projecting
into
a
school-house
,
which
school-house
was
under
a
*NL*
gable
of
the
church-roof
,
made
the
push
an
ecclesiastical
offence
.
It
*NL*
was
an
amusing
case
;
and
sent
me
up
to
Highgate
,
on
the
box
of
the
*NL*
stage-coach
,
thinking
about
the
Commons
,
and
what
Mr.
Spenlow
had
said
*NL*
about
touching
the
Commons
and
bringing
down
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
was
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
so
was
Rosa
Dartle
.
I
was
*NL*
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
Littimer
was
not
there
,
and
that
we
*NL*
were
attended
by
a
modest
little
parlor-maid
,
with
blue
ribbons
in
her
*NL*
cap
,
whose
eye
it
was
much
more
pleasant
,
and
much
less
disconcerting
,
*NL*
to
catch
by
accident
,
than
the
eye
of
that
respectable
man
.
But
what
I
*NL*
particularly
observed
,
before
I
had
been
half-an-hour
in
the
house
,
was
*NL*
the
close
and
attentive
watch
Miss
Dartle
kept
upon
me
;
and
the
lurking
*NL*
manner
in
which
she
seemed
to
compare
my
face
with
Steerforth
's
,
and
*NL*
Steerforth
's
with
mine
,
and
to
lie
in
wait
for
something
to
come
out
*NL*
between
the
two
.
So
surely
as
I
looked
towards
her
,
did
I
see
that
eager
*NL*
visage
,
with
its
gaunt
black
eyes
and
searching
brow
,
intent
on
mine
;
or
*NL*
passing
suddenly
from
mine
to
Steerforth
's
;
or
comprehending
both
of
us
*NL*
at
once
.
In
this
lynx-like
scrutiny
she
was
so
far
from
faltering
when
*NL*
she
saw
I
observed
it
,
that
at
such
a
time
she
only
fixed
her
piercing
*NL*
look
upon
me
with
a
more
intent
expression
still
.
Blameless
as
I
was
,
*NL*
and
knew
that
I
was
,
in
reference
to
any
wrong
she
could
possibly
*NL*
suspect
me
of
,
I
shrunk
before
her
strange
eyes
,
quite
unable
to
endure
*NL*
their
hungry
lustre
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
,
she
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
house
.
If
I
talked
to
*NL*
Steerforth
in
his
room
,
I
heard
her
dress
rustle
in
the
little
gallery
*NL*
outside
.
When
he
and
I
engaged
in
some
of
our
old
exercises
on
the
lawn
*NL*
behind
the
house
,
I
saw
her
face
pass
from
window
to
window
,
like
a
*NL*
wandering
light
,
until
it
fixed
itself
in
one
,
and
watched
us
.
When
we
*NL*
all
four
went
out
walking
in
the
afternoon
,
she
closed
her
thin
hand
on
*NL*
my
arm
like
a
spring
,
to
keep
me
back
,
while
Steerforth
and
his
mother
*NL*
went
on
out
of
hearing
:
and
then
spoke
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
a
long
time
,
''
she
said
,
``
without
coming
here
.
Is
your
*NL*
profession
really
so
engaging
and
interesting
as
to
absorb
your
whole
*NL*
attention
?
I
ask
because
I
always
want
to
be
informed
,
when
I
am
*NL*
ignorant
.
Is
it
really
,
though
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
I
liked
it
well
enough
,
but
that
I
certainly
could
not
*NL*
claim
so
much
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
am
glad
to
know
that
,
because
I
always
like
to
be
put
right
when
*NL*
I
am
wrong

said
Rosa
Dartle

``
You
mean
it
is
a
little
dry
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
replied
;
perhaps
it
_
was
_
a
little
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
and
that
's
a
reason
why
you
want
relief
and
change
--
excitement
,
and
*NL*
all
that
?
''
said
she
.
``
Ah
!
very
true
!
But
is
n't
it
a
little
--
Eh
?
--
for
*NL*
him
;
I
do
n't
mean
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quick
glance
of
her
eye
towards
the
spot
where
Steerforth
was
walking
,
*NL*
with
his
mother
leaning
on
his
arm
,
showed
me
whom
she
meant
;
but
beyond
*NL*
that
,
I
was
quite
lost
.
And
I
looked
so
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
it
--
I
do
n't
say
that
it
_
does
_
,
mind
I
want
to
know
--
do
n't
it
*NL*
rather
engross
him
?
Do
n't
it
make
him
,
perhaps
,
a
little
more
remiss
*NL*
than
usual
in
his
visits
to
his
blindly
doting
--
eh
?
''
With
another
quick
*NL*
glance
at
them
,
and
such
a
glance
at
me
as
seemed
to
look
into
my
*NL*
innermost
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dartle
,
''
I
returned
,
``
pray
do
not
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
!
''
she
said
.
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
do
n't
suppose
that
I
think
anything
!
*NL*
I
am
not
suspicious
.
I
only
ask
a
question
.
I
do
n't
state
any
opinion
.
I
*NL*
want
to
found
an
opinion
on
what
you
tell
me
.
Then
,
it
's
not
so
?
Well
!
I
*NL*
am
very
glad
to
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
is
not
the
fact
,
''
said
I
,
perplexed
,
``
that
I
am
*NL*
accountable
for
Steerforth
's
having
been
away
from
home
longer
than
*NL*
usual
--
if
he
has
been
:
which
I
really
do
n't
know
at
this
moment
,
unless
*NL*
I
understand
it
from
you
.
I
have
not
seen
him
this
long
while
,
until
*NL*
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Miss
Dartle
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
looked
full
at
me
,
I
saw
her
face
grow
sharper
and
paler
,
and
the
*NL*
marks
of
the
old
wound
lengthen
out
until
it
cut
through
the
disfigured
*NL*
lip
,
and
deep
into
the
nether
lip
,
and
slanted
down
the
face
.
There
was
*NL*
something
positively
awful
to
me
in
this
,
and
in
the
brightness
of
her
*NL*
eyes
,
as
she
said
,
looking
fixedly
at
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
repeated
the
words
,
more
to
myself
than
her
,
being
so
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
doing
?
''
she
said
,
with
an
eagerness
that
seemed
enough
to
*NL*
consume
her
like
a
fire
.
``
In
what
is
that
man
assisting
him
,
who
never
*NL*
looks
at
me
without
an
inscrutable
falsehood
in
his
eyes
?
If
you
are
*NL*
honorable
and
faithful
,
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
betray
your
friend
.
I
ask
you
*NL*
only
to
tell
me
,
is
it
anger
,
is
it
hatred
,
is
it
pride
,
is
it
*NL*
restlessness
,
is
it
some
wild
fancy
,
is
it
love
,
_
what
is
it
_
,
that
is
*NL*
leading
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dartle
,
''
I
returned
,
``
how
shall
I
tell
you
,
so
that
you
will
*NL*
believe
me
,
that
I
know
of
nothing
in
Steerforth
different
from
what
*NL*
there
was
when
I
first
came
here
.
I
can
think
of
nothing
.
I
firmly
*NL*
believe
there
is
nothing
.
I
hardly
understand
,
even
,
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
still
looked
fixedly
at
me
,
a
twitching
or
throbbing
,
from
which
*NL*
I
could
not
dissociate
the
idea
of
pain
,
came
into
that
cruel
mark
;
and
*NL*
lifted
up
the
corner
of
her
lip
as
if
with
scorn
,
or
with
a
pity
that
*NL*
despised
its
object
.
She
put
her
hand
upon
it
hurriedly
--
a
hand
so
thin
*NL*
and
delicate
,
that
when
I
had
seen
her
hold
it
up
before
the
fire
to
*NL*
shade
her
face
,
I
had
compared
it
in
my
thoughts
to
fine
porcelain
--
and
*NL*
saying
,
in
a
quick
,
fierce
,
passionate
way
,
``
I
swear
you
to
secresy
*NL*
about
this
!
''
said
not
a
word
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
was
particularly
happy
in
her
son
's
society
,
and
*NL*
Steerforth
was
,
on
this
occasion
,
particularly
attentive
and
respectful
*NL*
to
her
.
It
was
very
interesting
to
me
to
see
them
together
,
not
only
on
*NL*
account
of
their
mutual
affection
,
but
because
of
the
strong
personal
*NL*
resemblance
between
them
,
and
the
manner
in
which
what
was
haughty
or
*NL*
impetuous
in
him
was
softened
by
age
and
sex
,
in
her
,
to
a
gracious
*NL*
dignity
.
I
thought
,
more
than
once
,
that
it
was
well
no
serious
cause
of
*NL*
division
had
ever
come
between
them
;
or
two
such
natures
--
I
ought
rather
*NL*
to
express
it
,
two
such
shades
of
the
same
nature
--
might
have
been
*NL*
harder
to
reconcile
than
the
two
extremest
opposites
in
creation
.
The
*NL*
idea
did
not
originate
in
my
own
discernment
,
I
am
bound
to
confess
,
but
*NL*
in
a
speech
of
Rosa
Dartle
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
at
dinner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
do
tell
me
,
though
,
somebody
,
because
I
have
been
thinking
*NL*
about
it
all
day
,
and
I
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
know
what
,
Rosa
?
''
returned
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
``
Pray
,
pray
,
*NL*
Rosa
,
do
not
be
mysterious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mysterious
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Oh
!
really
?
Do
you
consider
me
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
constantly
entreat
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
``
to
speak
plainly
,
*NL*
in
your
own
natural
manner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
then
,
this
is
_
not
_
my
natural
manner
?
''
she
rejoined
.
``
Now
you
must
*NL*
really
bear
with
me
,
because
I
ask
for
information
.
We
never
know
*NL*
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
become
a
second
nature
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
without
any
*NL*
displeasure
;
``
but
I
remember
,
--
and
so
must
you
,
I
think
,
--
when
your
*NL*
manner
was
different
,
Rosa
;
when
it
was
not
so
guarded
,
and
was
more
*NL*
trustful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
are
right
,
''
she
returned
;
``
and
so
it
is
that
bad
habits
*NL*
grow
upon
one
!
Really
?
Less
guarded
and
more
trustful
?
How
_
can
_
I
,
*NL*
imperceptibly
,
have
changed
,
I
wonder
!
Well
,
that
's
very
odd
!
I
must
*NL*
study
to
regain
my
former
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
really
will
,
you
know
!
''
she
answered
.
``
I
will
learn
frankness
*NL*
from
--
let
me
see
--
from
James
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
learn
frankness
,
Rosa
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
quickly
--
for
*NL*
there
was
always
some
effect
of
sarcasm
in
what
Rosa
Dartle
said
,
though
*NL*
it
was
said
,
as
this
was
,
in
the
most
unconscious
manner
in
the
*NL*
world
--
``
in
a
better
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
sure
of
,
''
she
answered
,
with
uncommon
fervour
.
``
If
I
am
sure
*NL*
of
anything
,
of
course
,
you
know
,
I
am
sure
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
appeared
to
me
to
regret
having
been
a
little
nettled
;
*NL*
for
she
presently
said
,
in
a
kind
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Rosa
,
we
have
not
heard
what
it
is
that
you
want
to
be
*NL*
satisfied
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
want
to
be
satisfied
about
?
''
she
replied
,
with
provoking
*NL*
coldness
.
``
Oh
!
It
was
only
whether
people
,
who
are
like
each
other
in
*NL*
their
moral
constitution
--
is
that
the
phrase
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
good
a
phrase
as
another
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
:
--
whether
people
,
who
are
like
each
other
in
their
moral
*NL*
constitution
,
are
in
greater
danger
than
people
not
so
circumstanced
,
*NL*
supposing
any
serious
cause
of
variance
to
arise
between
them
,
of
being
*NL*
divided
angrily
and
deeply
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
yes
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
?
''
she
retorted
.
``
Dear
me
!
Supposing
then
,
for
instance
,
--
any
*NL*
unlikely
thing
will
do
for
a
supposition
--
that
you
and
your
mother
were
*NL*
to
have
a
serious
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rosa
,
''
interposed
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
laughing
good-naturedly
,
*NL*
``
suggest
some
other
supposition
!
James
and
I
know
our
duty
to
each
other
*NL*
better
,
I
pray
Heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Miss
Dartle
,
nodding
her
head
thoughtfully
.
``
To
be
sure
.
*NL*
_
That
_
would
prevent
it
?
Why
,
of
course
it
would
.
Ex-actly
.
Now
,
I
am
*NL*
glad
I
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
put
the
case
,
for
it
is
so
very
good
*NL*
to
know
that
your
duty
to
each
other
would
prevent
it
!
Thank
you
very
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
little
circumstance
connected
with
Miss
Dartle
I
must
not
*NL*
omit
;
for
I
had
reason
to
remember
it
thereafter
,
when
all
the
*NL*
irremediable
past
was
rendered
plain
.
During
the
whole
of
this
day
,
but
*NL*
especially
from
this
period
of
it
,
Steerforth
exerted
himself
with
his
*NL*
utmost
skill
,
and
that
was
with
his
utmost
ease
,
to
charm
this
singular
*NL*
creature
into
a
pleasant
and
pleased
companion
.
That
he
should
succeed
,
*NL*
was
no
matter
of
surprise
to
me
.
That
she
should
struggle
against
the
*NL*
fascinating
influence
of
his
delightful
art
--
delightful
nature
I
thought
*NL*
it
then
--
did
not
surprise
me
either
;
for
I
knew
that
she
was
sometimes
*NL*
jaundiced
and
perverse
.
I
saw
her
features
and
her
manner
slowly
change
;
*NL*
I
saw
her
look
at
him
with
growing
admiration
;
I
saw
her
try
,
more
and
*NL*
more
faintly
,
but
always
angrily
,
as
if
she
condemned
a
weakness
in
*NL*
herself
,
to
resist
the
captivating
power
that
he
possessed
;
and
finally
*NL*
I
saw
her
sharp
glance
soften
,
and
her
smile
become
quite
gentle
,
and
I
*NL*
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
her
as
I
had
really
been
all
day
,
and
we
all
sat
*NL*
about
the
fire
,
talking
and
laughing
together
,
with
as
little
reserve
as
*NL*
if
we
had
been
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
because
we
had
sat
there
so
long
,
or
because
Steerforth
*NL*
was
resolved
not
to
lose
the
advantage
he
had
gained
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
*NL*
we
did
not
remain
in
the
dining-room
more
than
five
minutes
after
her
*NL*
departure
.
``
She
is
playing
her
harp
,
''
said
Steerforth
,
softly
,
at
the
*NL*
drawing-room
door
,
``
and
nobody
but
my
mother
has
heard
her
do
that
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
these
three
years
.
''
He
said
it
with
a
curious
smile
,
which
was
*NL*
gone
directly
;
and
we
went
into
the
room
and
found
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
get
up
!
''
said
Steerforth
-LRB-
which
she
had
already
done
-RRB-
;
``
my
dear
*NL*
Rosa
,
do
n't
!
Be
kind
for
once
,
and
sing
us
an
Irish
song
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
care
for
an
Irish
song
?
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
!
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Much
more
than
for
any
other
.
Here
is
Daisy
,
*NL*
too
,
loves
music
from
his
soul
.
Sing
us
an
Irish
song
,
Rosa
!
and
let
me
*NL*
sit
and
listen
as
I
used
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
touch
her
,
or
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
,
but
sat
*NL*
himself
near
the
harp
.
She
stood
beside
it
for
some
little
while
,
in
a
*NL*
curious
way
,
going
through
the
motion
of
playing
it
with
her
right
hand
,
*NL*
but
not
sounding
it
.
At
length
she
sat
down
,
and
drew
it
to
her
with
one
*NL*
sudden
action
,
and
played
and
sang
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
,
in
her
touch
or
voice
,
that
made
that
song
the
*NL*
most
unearthly
I
have
ever
heard
in
my
life
,
or
can
imagine
.
There
was
*NL*
something
fearful
in
the
reality
of
it
.
It
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
*NL*
written
,
or
set
to
music
,
but
sprung
out
of
the
passion
within
her
;
*NL*
which
found
imperfect
utterance
in
the
low
sounds
of
her
voice
,
and
*NL*
crouched
again
when
all
was
still
.
I
was
dumb
when
she
leaned
beside
the
*NL*
harp
again
,
playing
it
,
but
not
sounding
it
,
with
her
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
more
,
and
this
had
roused
me
from
my
trance
:
--
Steerforth
had
*NL*
left
his
seat
,
and
gone
to
her
,
and
had
put
his
arm
laughingly
about
*NL*
her
,
and
had
said
,
``
Come
,
Rosa
,
for
the
future
we
will
love
each
other
*NL*
very
much
!
''
And
she
had
struck
him
,
and
had
thrown
him
off
with
the
fury
*NL*
of
a
wild
cat
,
and
had
burst
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
Rosa
?
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
coming
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
an
angel
,
mother
,
''
returned
Steerforth
,
``
for
a
little
*NL*
while
;
and
has
run
into
the
opposite
extreme
,
since
,
by
way
of
*NL*
compensation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
be
careful
not
to
irritate
her
,
James
.
Her
temper
has
been
*NL*
soured
,
remember
,
and
ought
not
to
be
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
did
not
come
back
;
and
no
other
mention
was
made
of
her
,
until
I
*NL*
went
with
Steerforth
into
his
room
to
say
Good
night
.
Then
he
laughed
*NL*
about
her
,
and
asked
me
if
I
had
ever
seen
such
a
fierce
little
piece
of
*NL*
incomprehensibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
as
much
of
my
astonishment
as
was
then
capable
of
*NL*
expression
,
and
asked
if
he
could
guess
what
it
was
that
she
had
taken
*NL*
so
much
amiss
,
so
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Heaven
knows
,
''
said
Steerforth
.
``
Any
thing
you
like
--
or
nothing
!
I
*NL*
told
you
she
took
every
thing
,
herself
included
,
to
a
grindstone
,
and
*NL*
sharpened
it
.
She
is
an
edge-tool
,
and
requires
great
care
in
dealing
*NL*
with
.
She
is
always
dangerous
.
Good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
!
''
said
I
,
``
my
dear
Steerforth
!
I
shall
be
gone
before
you
*NL*
wake
in
the
morning
.
Good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
unwilling
to
let
me
go
;
and
stood
,
holding
me
out
,
with
a
hand
on
*NL*
each
of
my
shoulders
,
as
he
had
done
in
my
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daisy
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
smile
--
``
for
though
that
's
not
the
name
your
*NL*
Godfathers
and
Godmothers
gave
you
,
it
's
the
name
I
like
best
to
call
*NL*
you
by
--
and
I
wish
,
I
wish
,
I
wish
,
you
could
give
it
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
I
can
,
if
I
choose
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daisy
,
if
anything
should
ever
separate
us
,
you
must
think
of
me
at
my
*NL*
best

old

.
Come
!
Let
us
make
that
bargain
.
Think
of
me
at
my
best
,
*NL*
if
circumstances
should
ever
part
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
best
to
me

Steerforth
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
no
worst
.
You
are
*NL*
always
equally
loved
,
and
cherished
in
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
compunction
for
having
ever
wronged
him
,
even
by
a
shapeless
*NL*
thought
,
did
I
feel
within
me
,
that
the
confession
of
having
done
so
was
*NL*
rising
to
my
lips
.
But
for
the
reluctance
I
had
,
to
betray
the
*NL*
confidence
of
Agnes
,
but
for
my
uncertainty
how
to
approach
the
subject
*NL*
with
no
risk
of
doing
so
,
it
would
have
reached
them
before
he
said
,
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
Daisy
,
and
good
night
!
''
In
my
doubt
,
it
did
_
not
_
reach
*NL*
them
;
and
we
shook
hands
,
and
we
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
up
with
the
dull
dawn
,
and
,
having
dressed
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
*NL*
looked
into
his
room
.
He
was
fast
asleep
;
lying
,
easily
,
with
his
head
*NL*
upon
his
arm
,
as
I
had
often
seen
him
lie
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
came
in
its
season
,
and
that
was
very
soon
,
when
I
almost
*NL*
wondered
that
nothing
troubled
his
repose
,
as
I
looked
at
him
.
But
he
*NL*
slept
--
let
me
think
of
him
so
again
--
as
I
had
often
seen
him
sleep
at
*NL*
school
;
and
thus
,
in
this
silent
hour
,
I
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Never
more
,
oh
God
forgive
you
,
Steerforth
!
to
touch
that
passive
hand
*NL*
in
love
and
friendship
.
Never
,
never
,
more

CHAPTER
XXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
LOSS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
down
to
Yarmouth
in
the
evening
,
and
went
to
the
inn
.
I
knew
that
*NL*
Peggotty
's
spare
room
--
my
room
--
was
likely
to
have
occupation
enough
in
*NL*
a
little
while
,
if
that
great
Visitor
,
before
whose
presence
all
the
*NL*
living
must
give
place
,
were
not
already
in
the
house
;
so
I
betook
*NL*
myself
to
the
inn
,
and
dined
there
,
and
engaged
my
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
ten
o'clock
when
I
went
out
.
Many
of
the
shops
were
shut
,
and
the
*NL*
town
was
dull
.
When
I
came
to
Omer
and
Joram
's
,
I
found
the
shutters
up
,
*NL*
but
the
shop
door
standing
open
.
As
I
could
obtain
a
perspective
view
of
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
inside
,
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
parlor-door
,
I
entered
,
and
*NL*
asked
him
how
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
my
life
and
soul
!
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
``
how
do
you
find
yourself
?
*NL*
Take
a
seat
.
--
Smoke
not
disagreeable
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
,
''
said
I.
``
I
like
it
--
in
somebody
else
's
pipe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
not
in
your
own
,
eh
?
''
Mr.
Omer
returned
,
laughing
.
``
All
the
*NL*
better
,
sir
.
Bad
habit
for
a
young
man
.
Take
a
seat
.
I
smoke
,
myself
,
*NL*
for
the
asthma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
had
made
room
for
me
,
and
placed
a
chair
.
He
now
sat
down
*NL*
again
,
very
much
out
of
breath
,
gasping
at
his
pipe
as
if
it
contained
a
*NL*
supply
of
that
necessary
,
without
which
he
must
perish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
have
heard
bad
news
of
Mr.
Barkis
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
looked
at
me
,
with
a
steady
countenance
,
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
how
he
is
to-night
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
question
I
should
have
put
to
you
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Omer
,
*NL*
``
but
on
account
of
delicacy
.
It
's
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
our
line
of
*NL*
business
.
When
a
party
's
ill
,
we
_
ca
n't
_
ask
how
the
party
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
difficulty
had
not
occurred
to
me
;
though
I
had
had
my
apprehensions
*NL*
too
,
when
I
went
in
,
of
hearing
the
old
tune
.
On
its
being
mentioned
,
I
*NL*
recognised
it
,
however
,
and
said
as
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
you
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
nodding
his
head
.
``
We
*NL*
durst
n't
do
it
.
Bless
you
,
it
would
be
a
shock
that
the
generality
of
*NL*
parties
might
n't
recover
,
to
say
`
Omer
and
Jorams
's
compliments
,
and
how
*NL*
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
'
--
or
this
afternoon
--
as
it
may
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
and
I
nodded
at
each
other
,
and
Mr.
Omer
recruited
his
wind
by
*NL*
the
aid
of
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
one
of
the
things
that
cut
the
trade
off
from
attentions
they
*NL*
could
often
wish
to
show
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Take
myself
.
If
I
have
known
*NL*
Barkis
a
year
,
to
move
to
as
he
went
by
,
I
have
known
him
forty
year
.
*NL*
But
_
I
_
ca
n't
go
and
say
`
how
is
he
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
it
was
rather
hard
on
Mr.
Omer
,
and
I
told
him
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
more
self-interested
,
I
hope
,
than
another
man
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
*NL*
``
Look
at
me
!
My
wind
may
fail
me
at
any
moment
,
and
it
ai
n't
likely
*NL*
that
,
to
my
own
knowledge
,
I
'd
be
self-interested
under
such
*NL*
circumstances
.
I
say
it
ai
n't
likely
,
in
a
man
who
knows
his
wind
will
*NL*
go
,
when
it
_
does
_
go
,
as
if
a
pair
of
bellows
was
cut
open
;
and
that
*NL*
man
a
grandfather
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
``
Not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
that
I
complain
of
my
line
of
business
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
It
*NL*
ai
n't
that
.
Some
good
and
some
bad
goes
,
no
doubt
,
to
all
callings

What
*NL*
I
wish
,
is
,
that
parties
were
brought
up
stronger-minded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
,
with
a
very
complacent
and
amiable
face
,
took
several
puffs
in
*NL*
silence
;
and
then
said
,
resuming
his
first
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accordingly
we
're
obleeged
,
in
ascertaining
how
Barkis
goes
on
,
to
*NL*
limit
ourselves
to
Em
`
ly
.
She
knows
what
our
real
objects
are
,
and
she
*NL*
do
n't
have
any
more
alarms
or
suspicions
about
us
,
than
if
we
was
so
*NL*
many
lambs

Minnie
and
Joram
have
just
stepped
down
to
the
house
,
in
*NL*
fact
-LRB-

's
there
,
after
hours
,
helping
her
aunt
a
bit
-RRB-
,
to
ask
her
how
*NL*
he
is
to-night
;
and
if
you
was
to
please
to
wait
till
they
come
back
,
*NL*
they
'd
give
you
full
partic
`

.
Will
you
take
something
?
A
glass
of
*NL*
srub
and
water
,
now
?
I
smoke
on
srub
and
water
,
myself
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
*NL*
taking
up
his
glass
,
``
because
it
's
considered
softening
to
the
passages
,
*NL*
by
which
this
troublesome
breath
of
mine
gets
into
action
.
But
,
Lord
*NL*
bless
you

said
Mr.
Omer
,
huskily
,
``
it
ai

the
passages

's
out

Give
me
breath
enough

I
to
my

Minnie

*NL*

'll
find
passages

my

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
had
no
breath
to
spare
,
and
it
was
very
alarming
to
see
him
*NL*
laugh
.
When
he
was
again
in
a
condition
to
be
talked
to
,
I
thanked
him
*NL*
for
the
proffered
refreshment
,
which
I
declined
,
as
I
had
just
had
*NL*
dinner
;
and
,
observing
that
I
would
wait
,
since
he
was
so
good
as
to
*NL*
invite
me
,
until
his
daughter
and
his
son-in-law
came
back
,
I
inquired
*NL*
how
little
Emily
was
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
removing
his
pipe
,
that
he
might
rub
his
*NL*
chin
;
``
I
tell
you
truly
,
I
shall
be
glad
when
her
marriage
has
taken
*NL*
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so

I
inquired

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

she
's
unsettled
at

said
Mr.

.
``
It

But
somehow
she

wants
heart

If
you
understand
,

said
Mr.
Omer
,
after
rubbing
his
chin
*NL*
again
,
and
smoking
a
little
,
``
what
I
mean
in
a

way
by
the

I
should
say

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
's
face
and
manner
went
for
so
much
,
that
I
could
*NL*
conscientiously
nod
my
head
,
as
divining
his
meaning
.
My
quickness
of
*NL*
apprehension
seemed
to
please
him
,
and
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
consider
this
is
principally
on
account
of
her
being
in
an
*NL*
unsettled
state

you
see

We
have
talked
it
over
a
good
deal
,
her
uncle
*NL*
and
myself
,
and
her
sweetheart
and
myself
,
after
business
;

I
*NL*
consider
it
is
principally
on
account
of
her
being
unsettled

You
must
*NL*
always
recollect
of
Em

said
Mr.
Omer
,
shaking
his
head
gently
,
*NL*
``
that
she
's
a
most
extraordinary
affectionate
little
thing

The
proverb
*NL*
says
,
`
You

make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
's
ear
.
'
Well
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
about
that
.
I
rather
think
you
may
,
if
you
begin
early
in
life
.
She
*NL*
has
made
a
home
out
of
that
old
boat

that
stone

marble
*NL*
could
n't
beat

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
has

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

the
clinging

pretty

Mr.

you

there

*NL*
a
struggle
going
on

Why

it
be
made
a
longer
*NL*
one
than
is
needful

*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
attentively
to
the
good
old
fellow

acquiesced
,
with
all
*NL*
my
heart

in
what
he
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore

I
mentioned

Mr.

in

easy-going

her
learning
has
been
quicker
than
was
*NL*
supposed
;
Omer
and
Joram
can
run
their
pen
through
what
remains
;
and
*NL*
she
's
free
when
you
wish
.
If
she
likes
to
make
any
little
arrangement
,
*NL*
afterwards
,
in
the
way
of
doing
any
little
thing
for
us
at
home
,
*NL*
very
well

very
well
still

We
're
no
losers
,
anyhow

*NL*
For

do

you
see

''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
touching
me
with
his
pipe
,
``
it
*NL*
ai
n't
likely
that
a
man
so
short
of
breath
as
myself
,
and
a
grandfather
*NL*
too
,
would
go
and
strain
points
with
a
little
bit
of
a
blue-eyed
*NL*
blossom
,
like
_
her
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
I
am
certain
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
You
're
right
!
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
her
cousin
--
you
*NL*
know
it
's
a
cousin
she
's
going
to
be
married
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
I
replied
.
``
I
know
him
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
do
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
.
``
Well
,
sir
!
Her
cousin
being
,
as
it
*NL*
appears
,
in
good
work
,
and
well
to
do
,
thanked
me
in
a
very
manly
sort
*NL*
of
manner
for
this
-LRB-
conducting
himself
altogether
,
I
must
say
,
in
a
way
*NL*
that
gives
me
a
high
opinion
of
him
-RRB-
,
and
went
and
took
as
comfortable
a
*NL*
little
house
as
you
or
I
could
wish
to
clap
eyes
on
.
That
little
house
*NL*
is
now
furnished
,
right
through
,
as
neat
and
complete
as
a
doll
's
*NL*
parlor
;
and
but
for
Barkis
's
illness
having
taken
this
bad
turn
,
poor
*NL*
fellow
,
they
would
have
been
man
and
wife
--
I
dare
say
,
by
this
time
.
As
*NL*
it
is
,
there
's
a
postponement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Emily
,
Mr.
Omer
?
''
I
inquired
.
``
Has
she
become
more
settled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
,
you
know
,
''
he
returned
,
rubbing
his
double
chin
again
,
``
ca
n't
*NL*
naturally
be
expected
.
The
prospect
of
the
change
and
separation
,
and
*NL*
all
that
,
is
,
as
one
may
say
,
close
to
her
and
far
away
from
her
,
both
*NL*
at
once
.
Barkis
's
death
need
n't
put
it
off
much
,
but
his
lingering
*NL*
might
.
Anyway
,
it
's
an
uncertain
state
of
matters
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Consequently
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Omer
,
``
Em
`
ly
's
still
a
little
down
,
and
a
*NL*
little
fluttered
;
perhaps
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
's
more
so
than
she
was
.
*NL*
Every
day
she
seems
to
get
fonder
and
fonder
of
her
uncle
,
and
more
loth
*NL*
to
part
from
all
of
us
.
A
kind
word
from
me
brings
the
tears
into
her
*NL*
eyes
;
and
if
you
was
to
see
her
with
my
daughter
Minnie
's
little
girl
,
*NL*
you
'd
never
forget
it
.
Bless
my
heart
alive
!
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
pondering
,
*NL*
``
how
she
loves
that
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
so
favourable
an
opportunity
,
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
Mr.
Omer
,
*NL*
before
our
conversation
should
be
interrupted
by
the
return
of
his
*NL*
daughter
and
her
husband
,
whether
he
knew
anything
of
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
rejoined
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
looking
very
much
dejected
.
``
No
*NL*
good
.
A
sad
story
,
sir
,
however
you
come
to
know
it
.
I
never
thought
*NL*
there
was
harm
in
the
girl
.
I
would
n't
wish
to
mention
it
before
my
*NL*
daughter
Minnie
--
for
she
'd
take
me
up
directly
--
but
I
never
did
.
None
of
*NL*
us
ever
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Omer
,
hearing
his
daughter
's
footstep
before
I
heard
it
,
touched
me
*NL*
with
his
pipe
,
and
shut
up
one
eye
,
as
a
caution
.
She
and
her
husband
*NL*
came
in
immediately
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
report
was
,
that
Mr.
Barkis
was
``
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
;
''
that
he
*NL*
was
quite
unconscious
;
and
that
Mr.
Chillip
had
mournfully
said
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
on
going
away
just
now
,
that
the
College
of
Physicians
,
the
*NL*
College
of
Surgeons
,
and
Apothecaries
'
Hall
,
if
they
were
all
called
in
*NL*
together
,
could
n't
help
him
.
He
was
past
both
Colleges
,
Mr.
Chillip
*NL*
said
,
and
the
Hall
could
only
poison
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
,
and
learning
that
Mr.
Peggotty
was
there
,
I
determined
to
*NL*
go
to
the
house
at
once
.
I
bade
good
night
to
Mr.
Omer
,
and
to
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Joram
;
and
directed
my
steps
thither
,
with
a
solemn
feeling
,
which
*NL*
made
Mr.
Barkis
quite
a
new
and
different
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
low
tap
at
the
door
was
answered
by
Mr.
Peggotty
.
He
was
not
so
much
*NL*
surprised
to
see
me
as
I
had
expected
.
I
remarked
this
in
Peggotty
,
too
,
*NL*
when
she
came
down
;
and
I
have
seen
it
since
;
and
I
think
,
in
the
*NL*
expectation
of
that
dread
surprise
,
all
other
changes
and
surprises
*NL*
dwindle
into
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
hands
with
Mr.
Peggotty
,
and
passed
into
the
kitchen
,
while
he
*NL*
softly
closed
the
door
.
Little
Emily
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
with
her
*NL*
hands
before
her
face
.
Ham
was
standing
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
spoke
in
whispers
;
listening
,
between
whiles
,
for
any
sound
in
the
*NL*
room
above
.
I
had
not
thought
of
it
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
,
*NL*
but
how
strange
it
was
to
me
now
,
to
miss
Mr.
Barkis
out
of
the
kitchen
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
kind
of
you
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
oncommon
kind
,
''
said
Ham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Em
`
ly
,
my
dear
,
''
cried
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
See
here
!
Here
's
Mas
'
r
Davy
come
!
*NL*
What
,
cheer
up
,
pretty
!
Not
a
wured
to
Mas
'
r
Davy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
trembling
upon
her
,
that
I
can
see
now
.
The
coldness
of
her
*NL*
hand
when
I
touched
it
,
I
can
feel
yet
.
Its
only
sign
of
animation
was
*NL*
to
shrink
from
mine
;
and
then
she
glided
from
the
chair
,
and
,
creeping
*NL*
to
the
other
side
of
her
uncle
,
bowed
herself
,
silently
and
trembling
*NL*
still
,
upon
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
such
a
loving
art
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
smoothing
her
rich
hair
*NL*
with
his
great
hard
hand
,
``
that
it
ca
n't
abear
the
sorrer
of
this
.
It
's
*NL*
nat
`
ral
in
young
folk
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
when
they
're
new
to
these
here
*NL*
trials
,
and
timid
,
like
my
little
bird
,
--
it
's
nat
`
ral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
clung
the
closer
to
him
,
but
neither
lifted
up
her
face
,
nor
spoke
a
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
getting
late
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
and
here
's
Ham
come
*NL*
fur
to
take
you
home
.
Theer
!
Go
along
with
t
`
other
loving
art
!
What
,
*NL*
Em
`
ly
?
Eh
,
my
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
her
voice
had
not
reached
me
,
but
he
bent
his
head
as
if
he
*NL*
listened
to
her
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
you
stay
with
your
uncle
?
Why
,
you
doe
n't
mean
to
ask
me
that
!
Stay
*NL*
with
your
uncle
,
Moppet
?
When
your
husband
that
'll
be
so
soon
,
is
here
*NL*
fur
to
take
you
home
?
Now
a
person
would
n't
think
it
,
fur
to
see
this
*NL*
little
thing
alongside
a
rough-weather
chap
like
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
*NL*
looking
round
at
both
of
us
,
with
infinite
pride
;
``
but
the
sea
ai
n't
*NL*
more
salt
in
it
than
she
has
fondness
in
her
for
her
uncle

a
foolish
*NL*
little
Em

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Em
`
ly
's
in
the
right
in
that
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
''
said
Ham
.
``
Lookee
here
!
As
*NL*
Em
`

wishes
of
it
,
and
as
she
's
hurried
and
frightened

like
,
besides
,
*NL*
I
'll
leave
her
till
morning
.
Let
me
stay
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
You
doe
n't
ought
--
a
married
man
like
*NL*
you

or
what
's

to
watch
and
work

That

You
go
home
and
*NL*
turn
in
.
You
ai
n't
afeerd
of
Em
`
ly
not
being
took
good
care
on
,
_
I
_
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
yielded
to
this
persuasion
,
and
took
his
hat
to
go
.
Even
when
he
*NL*
kissed
her
,
--
and
I
never
saw
him
approach
her
,
but
I
felt
that
nature
*NL*
had
given
him
the
soul
of
a
gentleman
,
--
she
seemed
to
cling
closer
to
*NL*
her
uncle
,
even
to
the
avoidance
of
her
chosen
husband
.
I
shut
the
door
*NL*
after
him
,
that
it
might
cause
no
disturbance
of
the
quiet
that
*NL*
prevailed
;
and
when
I
turned
back
,
I
found
Mr.
Peggotty
still
talking
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'm
a
going
up-stairs
to
tell
your
aunt
as
Mas
'
r
Davy
's
here
,
and
*NL*
that
'll
cheer
her
up
a
bit
,
''
he
said
.
``
Sit
ye
down
by
the
fire
,
the
*NL*
while
,
my
dear
,
and
warm
these
mortal
cold
hands

You
doe
n't
need
to
be
*NL*
so
fearsome
,
and
take
on
so
much
.
What
?
You
'll
go
along
with
me
?
--
Well
!
*NL*
come
along
with
me
--
come
!
If
her
uncle
was
turned
out
of
house
and
home
,
*NL*
and
forced
to
lay
down
in
a
dyke
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
*NL*
no
less
pride
than
before
,
``
it
's
my
belief
she
'd
go
along
with
him
,
now
!
*NL*
But
there
'll
be
some
one
else
,
soon
,
--
some
one
else
,
soon
,
Em
`

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
,
when
I
went
up-stairs
,
as
I
passed
the
door
of
my
little
*NL*
chamber
,
which
was
dark
,
I
had
an
indistinct
impression
of
her
being
*NL*
within
it
,
cast
down
upon
the
floor
.
But
,
whether
it
was
really
she
,
or
*NL*
whether
it
was
a
confusion
of
the
shadows
in
the
room
,
I
do
n't
know
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
leisure
to
think
,
before
the
kitchen-fire
,
of
pretty
little
*NL*
Em
`
ly
's
dread
of
death
--
which
,
added
to
what
Mr.
Omer
had
told
me
,
I
*NL*
took
to
be
the
cause
of
her
being
so
unlike
herself
--
and
I
had
leisure
,
*NL*
before
Peggotty
came
down
,
even
to
think
more
leniently
of
the
weakness
*NL*
of
it
:
as
I
sat
counting
the
ticking
of
the
clock
,
and
deepening
my
*NL*
sense
of
the
solemn
hush
around
me
.
Peggotty
took
me
in
her
arms
,
and
*NL*
blessed
and
thanked
me
over
and
over
again
for
being
such
a
comfort
to
*NL*
her
-LRB-
that
was
what
she
said
-RRB-
in
her
distress
.
She
then
entreated
me
to
*NL*
come
up-stairs
,
sobbing
that
Mr.
Barkis
had
always
liked
me
and
admired
*NL*
me
;
that
he
had
often
talked
of
me
,
before
he
fell
into
a
stupor
;
and
*NL*
that
she
believed
,
in
case
of
his
coming
to
himself
again
,
he
would
*NL*
brighten
up
at
sight
of
me
,
if
he
could
brighten
up
at
any
earthly
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
probability
of
his
ever
doing
so
,
appeared
to
me
,
when
I
saw
him
,
to
*NL*
be
very
small
.
He
was
lying
with
his
head
and
shoulders
out
of
bed
,
in
*NL*
an
uncomfortable
attitude
,
half
resting
on
the
box
which
had
cost
him
so
*NL*
much
pain
and
trouble
.
I
learned
,
that
,
when
he
was
past
creeping
out
of
*NL*
bed
to
open
it
,
and
past
assuring
himself
of
its
safety
by
means
of
the
*NL*
divining
rod
I
had
seen
him
use
,
he
had
required
to
have
it
placed
on
*NL*
the
chair
at
the
bed-side
,
where
he
had
ever
since
embraced
it
,
night
*NL*
and
day
.
His
arm
lay
on
it
now
.
Time
and
the
world
were
slipping
from
*NL*
beneath
him
,
but
the
box
was
there
;
and
the
last
words
he
had
uttered
*NL*
were
-LRB-
in
an
explanatory
tone
-RRB-
``
Old
clothes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barkis
,
my
dear
!
''
said
Peggotty
,
almost
cheerfully
:
bending
over
him
,
*NL*
while
her
brother
and
I
stood
at
the
bed
's
foot
.
``
Here
's
my
dear
boy
--
my
*NL*
dear
boy
,
Master
Davy
,
who
brought
us
together
,
Barkis
!
That
you
sent
*NL*
messages
by
,
you
know
!
Wo
n't
you
speak
to
Master
Davy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
as
mute
and
senseless
as
the
box
,
from
which
his
form
derived
the
*NL*
only
expression
it
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
going
out
with
the
tide
,

said
Mr.
Peggotty
to
me
,
behind
his

hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
eyes
were
dim
,
and
so
were
Mr.
Peggotty
's
;
but
I
repeated
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
``
With

I
find

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
remained
there
,
watching
him
,
a
long
time
--
hours
.
What
mysterious
*NL*
influence
my
presence
had
upon
him
in
that
state
of
his
senses
,
I
shall
*NL*
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
when
he
at
last
began
to
wander
feebly
,
it
is
*NL*
certain
he
was
muttering
about
driving
me
to
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
coming

said
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

touched

``

For
he
now
opened
his

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
if
he
knew

he
tried
to
stretch

out

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
GREATER
LOSS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
difficult
for
me
,
on
Peggotty
's
solicitation
,
to
resolve
to
*NL*
stay
where
I
was
,
until
after
the
remains
of
the
poor
carrier
should
*NL*
have
made
their
last
journey
to
Blunderstone
.
She
had
long
ago
bought
,
*NL*
out
of
her
own
savings
,
a
little
piece
of
ground
in
our
old
churchyard
*NL*
near
the
grave
``
of
her
sweet
girl
,
''
as
she
always
called
my
mother
;
and
*NL*
there
they
were
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
keeping
Peggotty
company
,
and
doing
all
I
could
for
her
-LRB-
little
*NL*
enough
at
the
utmost
-RRB-
,
I
was
as
grateful
,
I
rejoice
to
think
,
as
even
*NL*
now
I
could
wish
myself
to
have
been
.
But
I
am
afraid
I
had
a
supreme
*NL*
satisfaction
,
of
a
personal
and
professional
nature
,
in
taking
charge
of
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
's
will
,
and
expounding
its
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
claim
the
merit
of
having
originated
the
suggestion
that
the
*NL*
will
should
be
looked
for
in
the
box
.
After
some
search
,
it
was
found
*NL*
in
the
box
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
horse
's
nose-bag
;
wherein
-LRB-
besides
hay
-RRB-
*NL*
there
was
discovered
an
old
gold
watch
,
with
chain
and
seals
,
which
*NL*
Mr.
Barkis
had
worn
on
his
wedding-day
,
and
which
had
never
been
seen
*NL*
before
or
since
;
a
silver
tobacco-stopper
,
in
the
form
of
a
leg
;
an
*NL*
imitation
lemon
,
full
of
minute
cups
and
saucers
,
which
I
have
some
*NL*
idea
Mr.
Barkis
must
have
purchased
to
present
to
me
when
I
was
a
*NL*
child
,
and
afterwards
found
himself
unable
to
part
with
;
eighty-seven
*NL*
guineas
and
a
half
,
in
guineas
and
half
guineas
;
two
hundred
and
ten
*NL*
pounds
,
in
perfectly
clean
Bank
notes
;
certain
receipts
for
Bank
of
*NL*
England
stock
;
an
old
horse-shoe
,
a
bad
shilling
,
a
piece
of
camphor
,
*NL*
and
an
oyster-shell
.
From
the
circumstance
of
the
latter
article
having
*NL*
been
much
polished
,
and
displaying
prismatic
colours
on
the
inside
,
I
*NL*
conclude
that
Mr.
Barkis
had
some
general
ideas
about
pearls
,
which
*NL*
never
resolved
themselves
into
anything
definite
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
and
years
,
Mr.
Barkis
had
carried
this
box
,
on
all
his
*NL*
journeys
,
every
day
.
That
it
might
the
better
escape
notice
,
he
had
*NL*
invented
a
fiction
that
it
belonged
to
``
Mr.
Blackboy
,
''
and
was
``
to
be
*NL*
left
with
Barkis
till
called
for
;
''
a
fable
he
had
elaborately
written
on
*NL*
the
lid
,
in
characters
now
scarcely
legible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hoarded
,
all
these
years
,
I
found
,
to
good
purpose
.
His
property
*NL*
in
money
amounted
to
nearly
three
thousand
pounds
.
Of
this
he
bequeathed
*NL*
the
interest
of
one
thousand
to
Mr.
Peggotty
for
his
life
;
on
his
*NL*
decease
,
the
principal
to
be
equally
divided
between
Peggotty
,
little
*NL*
Emily
,
and
me
,
or
the
survivor
or
survivors
of
us
,
share
and
share
*NL*
alike
.
All
the
rest
he
died
possessed
of
,
he
bequeathed
to
Peggotty
;
*NL*
whom
he
left
residuary
legatee
,
and
sole
executrix
of
that
his
last
will
*NL*
and
testament
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
myself
quite
a
proctor
when
I
read
this
document
aloud
with
all
*NL*
possible
ceremony
,
and
set
forth
its
provisions
,
any
number
of
times
,
to
*NL*
those
whom
they
concerned
.
I
began
to
think
there
was
more
in
the
*NL*
Commons
than
I
had
supposed
.
I
examined
the
will
with
the
deepest
*NL*
attention
,
pronounced
it
perfectly
formal
in
all
respects
,
made
a
*NL*
pencil-mark
or
so
in
the
margin
,
and
thought
it
rather
extraordinary
*NL*
that
I
knew
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
abstruse
pursuit
;
in
making
an
account
for
,
Peggotty
,
of
all
the
*NL*
property
into
which
she
had
come
;
in
arranging
all
the
affairs
in
an
*NL*
orderly
manner
;
and
in
being
her
referee
and
adviser
on
every
point
,
to
*NL*
our
joint
delight
;
I
passed
the
week
before
the
funeral
.
I
did
not
see
*NL*
little
Emily
in
that
interval
,
but
they
told
me
she
was
to
be
quietly
*NL*
married
in
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
attend
the
funeral
in
character
,
if
I
may
venture
to
say
so
.
I
*NL*
mean
I
was
not
dressed
up
in
a
black
cloak
and
a
streamer
,
to
frighten
*NL*
the
birds
;
but
I
walked
over
to
Blunderstone
early
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
was
in
the
churchyard
when
it
came
,
attended
only
by
Peggotty
and
her
*NL*
brother
.
The
mad
gentleman
looked
on
,
out
of
my
little
window
;
Mr.
*NL*
Chillip
's
baby
wagged
its
heavy
head
,
and
rolled
its
goggle
eyes
,
at
the
*NL*
clergyman
,
over
its
nurse
's
shoulder
;
Mr.
Omer
breathed
short
in
the
*NL*
background
;
no
one
else
was
there
;
and
it
was
very
quiet
.
We
walked
*NL*
about
the
churchyard
for
an
hour
,
after
all
was
over
;
and
pulled
some
*NL*
young
leaves
from
the
tree
above
my
mother
's
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dread
falls
on
me
here
.
A
cloud
is
lowering
on
the
distant
town
,
*NL*
towards
which
I
retraced
my
solitary
steps
.
I
fear
to
approach
it
.
I
*NL*
can
not
bear
to
think
of
what
did
come
,
upon
that
memorable
night
;
of
*NL*
what
must
come
again
,
if
I
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
worse
,
because
I
write
of
it
.
It
would
be
no
better
,
if
I
*NL*
stopped
my
most
unwilling
hand
.
It
is
done
.
Nothing
can
undo
it
;
nothing
*NL*
can
make
it
otherwise
than
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
old
nurse
was
to
go
to
London
with
me
next
day
,
on
the
business
of
*NL*
the
will
.
Little
Emily
was
passing
that
day
at
Mr.
Omer
's
.
We
were
all
*NL*
to
meet
in
the
old
boathouse
that
night
.
Ham
would
bring
Emily
at
the
*NL*
usual
hour
.
I
would
walk
back
at
my
leisure
.
The
brother
and
sister
*NL*
would
return
as
they
had
come
,
and
be
expecting
us
,
when
the
day
closed
*NL*
in
,
at
the
fireside
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
parted
from
them
at
the
wicket-gate
,
where
visionary
Straps
had
rested
*NL*
with
Roderick
Random
's
knapsack
in
the
days
of
yore
;
and
,
instead
of
*NL*
going
straight
back
,
walked
a
little
distance
on
the
road
to
Lowestoft
.
*NL*
Then
I
turned
,
and
walked
back
towards
Yarmouth
.
I
stayed
to
dine
at
a
*NL*
decent
alehouse
,
some
mile
or
two
from
the
Ferry
I
have
mentioned
*NL*
before
;
and
thus
the
day
wore
away
,
and
it
was
evening
when
I
reached
*NL*
it
.
Rain
was
falling
heavily
by
that
time
,
and
it
was
a
wild
night
;
but
*NL*
there
was
a
moon
behind
the
clouds
,
and
it
was
not
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
soon
within
sight
of
Mr.
Peggotty
's
house
,
and
of
the
light
within
*NL*
it
shining
through
the
window
.
A
little
floundering
across
the
sand
,
*NL*
which
was
heavy
,
brought
me
to
the
door
,
and
I
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
looked
very
comfortable
,
indeed
.
Mr.
Peggotty
had
smoked
his
evening
*NL*
pipe
,
and
there
were
preparations
for
some
supper
by-and-by
.
The
fire
*NL*
was
bright
,
the
ashes
were
thrown
up
,
the
locker
was
ready
for
little
*NL*
Emily
in
her
old
place
.
In
her
own
old
place
sat
Peggotty
,
once
more
,
*NL*
looking
-LRB-
but
for
her
dress
-RRB-
as
if
she
had
never
left
it
.
She
had
fallen
*NL*
back
,
already
,
on
the
society
of
the
work-box
with
Saint
Paul
's
upon
the
*NL*
lid
,
the
yard-measure
in
the
cottage
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
candle
:
and
*NL*
there
they
all
were
,
just
as
if
they
had
never
been
disturbed
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Gummidge
appeared
to
be
fretting
a
little
,
in
her
old
corner
;
and
*NL*
consequently
looked
quite
natural
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
first
of
the
lot
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
a
happy
*NL*
face
.
``
Doe
n't
keep
in
that
coat
,
sir
,
if
it
's
wet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Peggotty
,
''
said
I
,
giving
him
my
outer
coat
to
hang
up
.
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
dry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
't
is
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
feeling
my
shoulders
.
``
As
a
chip
!
Sit
ye
*NL*
down
,
sir
.
It
ai
n't
o
'
no
use
saying
welcome
to
you
,
but
you
're
welcome
,
*NL*
kind
and
hearty

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Peggotty
,
I
am
sure
of
that
.
Well
,
Peggotty
!
''
said
I
,
*NL*
giving
her
a
kiss
.
``
And
how
are
you
,
old
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
''
laughed
Mr.
Peggotty
,
sitting
down
beside
us
,
and
rubbing
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
sense
of
relief
from
recent
trouble
,
and
in
the
genuine
*NL*
heartiness
of
his
nature
;
``
there
's
not
a
woman
in
the
wureld
,
sir
--
as
*NL*
I
tell
her
--
that
need
to
feel
more
easy
in
her
mind
than

She

done
what

right
by
the

*NL*
and
--
and
--
and
it
's

all

right

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheer
up
,
my
pretty
mawther
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
-LRB-
But
he
shook
his
head
*NL*
aside
at
us
,
evidently
sensible
of
the
tendency
of
the
late
occurrences
*NL*
to
recal
the
memory
of
the
old
one
.
-RRB-
``
Doe
n't
be
down

Cheer
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

returned
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
soothing
her
sorrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
should
I
ever
spend
it
without

?
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
*NL*
an
air
of
serious
remonstrance
.
``
What
are

a
talking
on

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
with
a
*NL*
pitiable
whimper
,
``
and
now
I
'm
told

How
could
I
expect

*NL*
being
so
lone

lorn
,
and
so
contrairy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
seemed
very
much
shocked
at
himself
for
having
made
a
*NL*
speech
capable
of
this
unfeeling
construction
,
but
was
prevented
from
*NL*
replying
,
by
Peggotty
's
pulling
his
sleeve
,
and
shaking
her
head
.
After
*NL*
looking
at
Mrs.
Gummidge
for
some
moments
,
in
sore
distress
of
mind
,
he
*NL*
glanced
at

put
it
in

Mr.

cheerily

*NL*
Mrs.

slightly

said
Mr.

bending
over

with
great
glee

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
Peggotty
;
very
fond
of
him
for
it
,
if
she
thought
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
returned
Mr.
Peggotty
,
standing
with
his
legs
pretty
wide
apart
,
*NL*
and
rubbing
his
hands
up
and
down
them
in
his
comfortable
satisfaction
,
*NL*
as
he
looked
alternately
at
us
and
at
the
fire
,
``
I

*NL*
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``

observed
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

laughed
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
not

Now
I
tell

When

Mr.

with
sudden
emphasis

Mr.

,
*NL*
relieving
his
earnestness
with
a
roar
of
laughter

*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty

I
both
laughed
,

not
so
loud

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

delighted

some
further
rubbing
of
his
legs
,
``

said
Mr.

Peggotty
,
stopping
in
his
roar

and
smiting
his
hands
together
;
``
fur

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
Ham
.
The
night
should
have
turned
more
wet
since
I
came
in
,
*NL*
for
he
had
a
large
sou
`
wester
hat
on
,
slouched
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
made
a
motion
with
his
head
,
as
if
she
were
outside
.
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
took
the
light
from
the
window
,
trimmed
it
,
put
it
on
the
table
,
and
was
*NL*
busily
stirring
the
fire
,
when
Ham
,
who
had
not
moved
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
We
went
out
.
As
I
passed
him
at
the
door
,
I
saw
,
to
my
astonishment
and
*NL*
fright
,
that
he
was
deadly
pale
.
He
pushed
me
hastily
into
the
open
air
,
*NL*
and
closed
the
door
upon
us
.
Only
upon
us
two

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Oh
,
for
his
broken
heart
,
how
dreadfully
he
wept
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
paralyzed
by
the
sight
of
such
grief
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
thought
,
*NL*
or
what
I
dreaded

I
could
only
look
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
face
he
turned
up
to
the
troubled
sky
,
the
quivering
of
his
clasped
*NL*
hands
,
the
agony
of
his
figure
,
remain
associated
with
that
lonely
*NL*
waste
,
in
my
remembrance
,
to
this
hour
.
It
is
always
night
there
,
and
he
*NL*
is
the
only
object
in
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

he
said
,
hurriedly
,
``

What

*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
the
door
move
,
and
instinctively
tried
to
hold
the
latch
on
the
*NL*
outside
,
to
gain
a
moment
's
time
.
It
was
too
late
.
Mr.
Peggotty
thrust
*NL*
forth
his
face
;
and
never
could
I
forget
the
change
that
came
upon
it
*NL*
when
he
saw
us
,
if
I
were
to
live
five
hundred
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
a
great
wail
and
cry
,
and
the
women
hanging
about
him
,
and
we
*NL*
all
standing
in
the
room
;
I
with
a
paper
in
my
hand
,
which
Ham
had
given
*NL*
me
;
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
his
vest
torn
open
,
his
hair
wild
,
his
face
and
*NL*
lips
quite
white
,
and
blood
trickling
down
his
bosom
-LRB-
it
had
sprung
from
*NL*
his
mouth
,
I
think
-RRB-
,
looking
fixedly
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read

he
said
,
in
a
low
shivering
voice
.
``
Slow

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
silence
of
death

I
read
thus
,
from
a
blotted
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*

When
I
leave

in

the
morning

*NL*
*NL*
the
letter
bore
date
on

*NL*
*NL*

it
will
be
never

come
back
,
unless
he
brings
me
back
a

*NL*
This
will
be
found
at
night
,
many
hours
after
,
instead
of
me

*NL*
Oh
,
if
you
knew
how
my
heart
is
torn
.
If
even
you
,
that
I
have
*NL*
wronged
so
much

that
never
can
forgive
me
,
could
only
know
what
*NL*
I
suffer

I
am
too
wicked
to
write
about
myself

Oh

take
comfort
*NL*
in
thinking
that
I
am
so
bad

Oh

for
mercy

tell

that
I
never

half

Oh

do

affectionate

kind
you
have
all
been

do
n't
remember

were
ever

but
try
to
think
as

I
died

little

was
buried
somewhere

Pray
Heaven
that

*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
long
after
I
had
ceased
to
read
,
still
looking
at
me
.
At
*NL*
length
I
ventured
to
take
his
hand
,
and
to
entreat
him
,
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
,
to
endeavour
to
get
some
command
of
himself
.
He
replied
,
``
I
*NL*
thankee

I
thankee

''
without
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
spoke
to
him
.
Mr.
Peggotty
was
so
far
sensible
of
_
his
_
affliction
,
*NL*
that
he
wrung
his
hand
;
but
,
otherwise
,
he
remained
in
the
same
state
,
*NL*
and
no
one
dared
to
disturb
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
,
at
last
,
he
moved
his
eyes
from
my
face
,
as
if
he
were
waking
*NL*
from
a
vision
,
and
cast
them
round
the
room
.
Then
he
said
,
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
the
man
?
I
want
to
know
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
glanced
at
me
,
and
suddenly
I
felt
a
shock
that
struck
me
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

said
Mr.

.
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
shock
again
.
I
sank
down
in
a
chair
,
and
tried
to
utter
some
*NL*
reply
;
but
my
tongue
was
fettered
,
and
my
sight
was
weak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
heard
said
,
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
time
past

Ham
faltered
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

stood
fixed
as

now
looking
at
him

*NL*
*NL*
``

pursued
Ham
,

*NL*
I
felt
Peggotty

arm
round
my
neck

I
could
not
have
moved

the

house
had
been
about

fall
upon

falling

putting
out

his

keep
off

dreaded

``

exclaimed
Ham
,
in

broken
voice
,

I
am

Steerforth

he
's
a
damned
villain

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
uttered
no
cry
,
and
shed
no
tear
,
and
moved
no
more
,
until
*NL*
he
seemed
to
wake
again
,
all
at
once
,
and
pulled
down
his
rough
coat
*NL*
from
its
peg
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bear
a
hand
with
this
!
I
'm
struck
of
a
heap
,

n't

he
said
,
*NL*
impatiently
.
``
Bear
a
hand

and
help
me
.
Well
!

when
somebody
had
done
*NL*
so
.
``
Now
give
me
that
theer
hat

*NL*
*NL*
Ham
asked
him
whither
he
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
going

*NL*
*NL*

,
interposing
himself
before
the
door

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

cried
Mrs.

coming
between

,
in
a
fit
of
crying
.
*NL*
``

speak
a

word
about
them
times
when

was

an

when

was
*NL*
too
,
and
when
I
was
a
poor
widder

you
took
me
in

It
'll

soften

laying

*NL*
many

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quite
passive
now
;
and
when
I
heard
him
crying
,
the
impulse
that
*NL*
had
been
upon
me
to
go
down
upon
my
knees
,
and
ask
their
pardon
for
the
*NL*
desolation
I
had
caused
,
and
curse
Steerforth
,
yielded
to
a
better
*NL*
feeling

My
overcharged
heart
found
the

relief
,
and
I
cried
too

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BEGINNING
OF
A
LONG
JOURNEY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
natural
in
me
,
is
natural
in
many
other
men
,
I
infer
,
and
so
I
*NL*
am
not
afraid
to
write
that
I
never
had
loved
Steerforth
better
than
*NL*
when
the
ties
that
bound
me
to
him
were
broken
.
In
the
keen
distress
of
*NL*
the
discovery
of
his
unworthiness
,
I
thought
more
of
all
that
was
*NL*
brilliant
in
him
,
I
softened
more
towards
all
that
was
good
in
him
,
I
*NL*
did
more
justice
to
the
qualities
that
might
have
made
him
a
man
of
a
*NL*
noble
nature
and
a
great
name
,
than
ever
I
had
done
in
the
height
of
my
*NL*
devotion
to
him
.
Deeply
as
I
felt
my
own
unconscious
part
in
his
*NL*
pollution
of
an
honest
home
,
I
believe
that
if
I
had
been
brought
face
*NL*
to
face
with
him
,
I
could
not
have
uttered
one
reproach
.
I
should
have
*NL*
loved
him
so
well
still
--
though
he
fascinated
me
no
longer
--
I
should
*NL*
have
held
in
so
much
tenderness
the
memory
of
my
affection
for
him
,
that
*NL*
I
think
I
should
have
been
as
weak
as
a
spirit-wounded
child
,
in
all
but
*NL*
the
entertainment
of
a
thought
that
we
could
ever
be
re-united
.
That
*NL*
thought
I
never
had
.
I
felt
,
as
he
had
felt
,
that
all
was
at
an
end
*NL*
between
us
.
What
his
remembrances
of
me
were
,
I
have
never
known
--
they
*NL*
were
light
enough
,
perhaps
,
and
easily
dismissed
--
but
mine
of
him
were
*NL*
as
the
remembrances
of
a
cherished
friend
,
who
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
Steerforth
,
long
removed
from
the
scenes
of
this
poor
history
!
My
*NL*
sorrow
may
bear
involuntary
witness
against
you
at
the
Judgment
Throne
;
*NL*
but
my
angry
thoughts
or
my
reproaches
never
will
,
I
know
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
what
had
happened
soon
spread
through
the
town
;
insomuch
*NL*
that
as
I
passed
along
the
streets
next
morning
,
I
overheard
the
people
*NL*
speaking
of
it
at
their
doors
.
Many
were
hard
upon
her
,
some
few
were
*NL*
hard
upon
him
,
but
towards
her
second
father
and
her
lover
there
was
but
*NL*
one
sentiment
.
Among
all
kinds
of
people
a
respect
for
them
in
their
*NL*
distress
prevailed
,
which
was
full
of
gentleness
and
delicacy
.
The
*NL*
seafaring
men
kept
apart
,
when
those
two
were
seen
early
,
walking
with
*NL*
slow
steps
on
the
beach
;
and
stood
in
knots
,
talking
compassionately
*NL*
among
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
beach
,
close
down
by
the
sea
,
that
I
found
them
.
It
would
*NL*
have
been
easy
to
perceive
that
they
had
not
slept
all
last
night
,
even
*NL*
if
Peggotty
had
failed
to
tell
me
of
their
still
sitting
just
as
I
left
*NL*
them
,
when
it
was
broad
day
.
They
looked
worn
;
and
I
thought
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
's
head
was
bowed
in
one
night
more
than
in
all
the
years
I
had
*NL*
known
him
.
But
they
were
both
as
grave
and
steady
as
the
sea
itself
:
*NL*
then
lying
beneath
a
dark
sky
,
waveless
--
yet
with
a
heavy
roll
upon
it
,
*NL*
as
if
it
breathed
in
its
rest
--
and
touched
,
on
the
horizon
,
with
a
strip
*NL*
of
silvery
light
from
the
unseen
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
had
a
mort
of
talk
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
to
me
,
when
we
had
*NL*
all
three
walked
a
little
while
in
silence
,
``
of
what
we
ought
and
doe
n't
*NL*
ought
to
do
.
But
we
see
our
course
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
happened
to
glance
at
Ham
,
then
looking
out
to
sea
upon
the
distant
*NL*
light
,
and
a
frightful
thought
came
into
my
mind
--
not
that
his
face
was
*NL*
angry
,
for
it
was
not
;
I
recal
nothing
but
an
expression
of
stern
*NL*
determination
in
it
--
that
if
ever
he
encountered
Steerforth
,
he
would
*NL*
kill
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dooty
here
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
is
done
.
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
*NL*
my
--
''
he
stopped
,
and
went
on
in
a
firmer
voice
:
``
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
*NL*
her
.
That
's
my
dooty
evermore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
when
I
asked
him
where
he
would
seek
her
,
and
inquired
*NL*
if
I
were
going
to
London
to-morrow
?
I
told
him
I
had
not
gone
to-day
,
*NL*
fearing
to
lose
the
chance
of
being
of
any
service
to
him
;
but
that
I
*NL*
was
ready
to
go
when
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
along
with
you
,
sir
,
''
he
rejoined
,
``
if
you
're
agreeable
,
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
again
,
for
a
while
,
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ham
,
''
he
presently
resumed
,
``
he
'll
hold
to
his
present
work
,
and
go
and
*NL*
live
along
with
my
sister
.
The
old
boat
yonder
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
desert
the
old
boat
,
Mr.
Peggotty
?
''
I
gently
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
station
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
returned
,
``
ai
n't
there
no
longer
;
and
if
*NL*
ever
a
boat
foundered
,
since
there
was
darkness
on
the
face
of
the
deep
,
*NL*
that
one
's
gone
down
.
But
no
,
sir
,
no
;
I
doe
n't
mean
as
it
should
be
*NL*
deserted
.
Fur
from
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
again
for
a
while
,
as
before
,
until
he
explained
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wishes
is
,
sir
,
as
it
shall
look
,
day
and
night
,
winter
and
summer
,
*NL*
as
it
has
always
looked
,
since
she
first
know
'd
it
.
If
ever
she
should
*NL*
come
a
wandering
back
,
I
would
n't
have
the
old
place
seem
to
cast
her
*NL*
off
,
you
understand
,
but
seem
to
tempt
her
to
draw
nigher
to
`
t
,
and
to
*NL*
peep
in
,
maybe
,
like
a
ghost
,
out
of
the
wind
and
rain
,
through
the
old
*NL*
winder
,
at
the
old
seat
by
the
fire
.
Then
,
maybe
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
seein
'
*NL*
none
but
Missis
Gummidge
there
,
she
might
take
heart
to
creep
in
,
*NL*
trembling
;
and
might
come
to
be
laid
down
in
her
old
bed
,
and
rest
her
*NL*
weary
head
where
it
was
once
so
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
speak
to
him
in
reply
,
though
I
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
night
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
as
reg
`
lar
as
the
night
comes
,
the
*NL*
candle
must
be
stood
in
its
old
pane
of
glass
,
that
if
ever
she
should
*NL*
see
it
,
it
may
seem
to
say
`
Come
back
,
my
child
,
come
back
!
'
If
ever
*NL*
there
's
a
knock

a
soft

door

you
go
nigh
it
.
Let
it
be
her
--
not
you

that
sees
my
*NL*
fallen
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
a
little
in
front
of
us
,
and
kept
before
us
for
some
minutes
.
*NL*
During
this
interval
,
I
glanced
at
Ham
again
,
and
observing
the
same
*NL*
expression
on
his
face
,
and
his
eyes
still
directed
to
the
distant
*NL*
light
,
I
touched
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
I
called
him
by
his
name
,
in
the
tone
in
which
I
might
have
tried
*NL*
to
rouse
a
sleeper
,
before
he
heeded
me
.
When
I
at
last
inquired
on
what
*NL*
his
thoughts
were
so
bent
,
he
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
's
afore
me
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
;
and
over
yon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
life
before
you
,
do
you
mean
?
''
He
had
pointed
confusedly
out
to
*NL*
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
.
I
doe
n't
rightly
know
how
't
is
,
but
from
over
yon
there
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
come
--
the
end
of
it
like
;
''
looking
at
me
as
if
he
were
*NL*
waking
,
but
with
the
same
determined
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
end
?
''
I
asked
,
possessed
by
my
former
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doe
n't
know
,
''
he
said
thoughtfully
;
``
I
was
calling
to
mind
that
the
*NL*
beginning
of
it
all
did
take
place
here
--
and
then
the
end
come
.
But
it
's
*NL*
gone
!
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
added
;
answering
,
as
I
think
,
my
look
;
``
you
ha
n't
*NL*
no
call
to
be
afeerd
of
me
:
but
I
'm
kiender
muddled
;
I
doe
n't
fare
to
*NL*
feel
no
matters
,
''
--
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
was
not
himself
,
*NL*
and
quite
confounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
stopping
for
us
to
join
him
:
we
did
so
,
and
said
no
more
.
*NL*
The
remembrance
of
this
,
in
connexion
with
my
former
thought
,
however
,
*NL*
haunted
me
at
intervals
,
even
until
the
inexorable
end
came
at
its
*NL*
appointed
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
insensibly
approached
the
old
boat
,
and
entered
.
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
no
*NL*
longer
moping
in
her
especial
corner
,
was
busy
preparing
breakfast
.
She
*NL*
took
Mr.
Peggotty
's
hat
,
and
placed
his
seat
for
him
,
and
spoke
so
*NL*
comfortably
and
softly
,
that
I
hardly
knew
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dan
`
l
,
my
good
man
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
must
eat
and
drink
,
and
keep
up
*NL*
your
strength
,
for
without
it
you
'll
do

.
Try
,
that
's
a
dear
soul

*NL*
And
if
I
disturb
you
with
my
clicketten

she
meant
her
chattering
,
*NL*
``
tell
me
so
,
Dan
`

,
and
I
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
served
us
all
,
she
withdrew
to
the
window
,
where
she
*NL*
sedulously
employed
herself
in
repairing
some
shirts
and
other
clothes
*NL*
belonging
to
Mr.
Peggotty
,
and
neatly
folding
and
packing
them
in
an
old
*NL*
oilskin
bag
,
such
as
sailors
carry
.
Meanwhile
,
she
continued
talking
,
in
*NL*
the
same
quiet
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
times
and
seasons
,
you
know
,
Dan
`
l
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
``
I
shall
*NL*
be
allus
here
,
and
every
think
will
look
accordin
'
to
your
wishes
.
I
'm
a
*NL*
poor
scholar
,
but
I
shall
write
to
you
,
odd
times
,
when
you
're
away
,
and
*NL*
send
my
letters
to
Mas
'
r
Davy
.
Maybe
you
'll
write
to
me
too
,
Dan
`
l
,
odd
*NL*
times
,
and
tell
me
how
you
fare
to
feel
upon
your
lone
lorn
journies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
a
solitary
woman
heer
,
I
'm
afeerd
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Dan
`
l
,
''
she
returned
,
``
I
sha
n't
be
that
.
Doe
n't
you
mind
me
.
I
*NL*
shall
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
a
Beein
for
you
''
-LRB-
Mrs.
Gummidge
meant
a
*NL*
home
-RRB-
,
``
again
you
come
back
--
to
keep
a
Beein
here
for
any
that
may
hap
*NL*
to
come
back

Dan
`

.
In
the
fine
time
,
I
shall
set
outside
the
door
as
I
*NL*
used
to
do

If
any
_
should
_
come
nigh

they
shall
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
change
in
Mrs.
Gummidge
in
a
little
time
!
She
was
another
woman
.
*NL*
She
was
so
devoted
,
she
had
such
a
quick
perception
of
what
it
would
*NL*
be
well
to
say
,
and
what
it
would
be
well
to
leave
unsaid
,
she
was
so
*NL*
forgetful
of
herself
,
and
so
regardful
of
the
sorrow
about
her
,
that
*NL*
I
held
her
in
a
sort
of
veneration
.
The
work
she
did
that
day
!
There
*NL*
were
many
things
to
be
brought
up
from
the
beach
and
stored
in
the
*NL*
outhouse
--
as
oars
,
nets
,
sails
,
cordage
,
spars
,
lobster-pots
,
bags
of
*NL*
ballast
,
and
the
like
;
and
though
there
was
abundance
of
assistance
*NL*
rendered
,
there
being
not
a
pair
of
working
hands
on
all
that
shore
*NL*
but
would
have
labored
hard
for
Mr.
Peggotty
,
and
been
well
paid
in
*NL*
being
asked
to
do
it
,
yet
she
persisted
,
all
day
long
,
in
toiling
under
*NL*
weights
that
she
was
quite
unequal
to
,
and
fagging
to
and
fro
on
all
*NL*
sorts
of
unnecessary
errands
.
As
to
deploring
her
misfortunes
,
she
*NL*
appeared
to
have
entirely
lost
the
recollection
of
ever
having
had
any
.
*NL*
She
preserved
an
equable
cheerfulness
in
the
midst
of
her
sympathy
,
*NL*
which
was
not
the
least
astonishing
part
of
the
change
that
had
come
*NL*
over
her
.
Querulousness
was
out
of
the
question
.
I
did
not
even
observe
*NL*
her
voice
to
falter
,
or
a
tear
to
escape
from
her
eyes
,
the
whole
day
*NL*
through
,
until
twilight
;
when
she
and
I
and
Mr.
Peggotty
being
alone
*NL*
together
,
and
he
having
fallen
asleep
in
perfect
exhaustion
,
she
broke
*NL*
into
a
half-suppressed
fit
of
sobbing
and
crying
,
and
taking
me
to
*NL*
the
door
,
said
,
``
Ever
bless
you
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
be
a
friend
to
him
,
poor
*NL*
dear
!
''
Then
,
she
immediately
ran
out
of
the
house
to
wash
her
face
,
*NL*
in
order
that
she
might
sit
quietly
beside
him
,
and
be
found
at
work
*NL*
there
,
when
he
should
awake
.
In
short
I
left
her
,
when
I
went
away
at
*NL*
night
,
the
prop
and
staff
of
Mr.
Peggotty
's
affliction
;
and
I
could
not
*NL*
meditate
enough
upon
the
lesson
that
I
read
in
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
and
the
*NL*
new
experience
she
unfolded
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
when
,
strolling
in
a
melancholy
*NL*
manner
through
the
town
,
I
stopped
at
Mr.
Omer
's
door
.
Mr.
Omer
had
*NL*
taken
it
so
much
to
heart
,
his
daughter
told
me
,
that
he
had
been
very
*NL*
low
and
poorly
all
day
,
and
had
gone
to
bed
without
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
deceitful
,
bad-hearted
girl
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joram
.
``
There
was
no
good
in
*NL*
her
,
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
so
,
''
I
returned
.
``
You
do
n't
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Joram
,
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Joram
tossed
her
head
,
endeavouring
to
be
very
stern
and
cross
;
but
*NL*
she
could
not
command
her
softer
self
,
and
began
to
cry
.
I
was
young
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
;
but
I
thought
much
the
better
of
her
for
this
sympathy
,
and
*NL*
fancied
it
became
her
,
as
a
virtuous
wife
and
mother
,
very
well
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
she
ever
do
!
''
sobbed
Minnie
.
``
Where
will
she
go
!
What
will
*NL*
become
of
her
!
Oh
,
how
could
she
be
so
cruel
,
to
herself
and
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
the
time
when
Minnie
was
a
young
and
pretty
girl
;
and
I
was
*NL*
glad
that
she
remembered
it
too
,
so
feelingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
Minnie
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joram
,
``
has
only
just
now
been
got
to
*NL*
sleep
.
Even
in
her
sleep
she
is
sobbing
for
Em
`
ly
.
All
day
long
,
little
*NL*
Minnie
has
cried
for
her
,
and
asked
me
,
over
and
over
again
,
whether
*NL*
Em
`
ly
was
wicked
?
What
can
I
say
to
her
,
when
Em
`
ly
tied
a
ribbon
off
*NL*
her
own
neck
round
little
Minnie
's
the
last
night
she
was
here
,
and
laid
*NL*
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
beside
her
till
she
was
fast
asleep
!
The
*NL*
ribbon
's
round
my
little
Minnie
's
neck
now
.
It
ought
not
to
be
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
but
what
can
I
do
?
Em
`
ly
is
very
bad
,
but
they
were
fond
of
one
another
.
*NL*
And
the
child
knows
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Joram
was
so
unhappy
,
that
her
husband
came
out
to
take
care
of
*NL*
her
.
Leaving
them
together
,
I
went
home
to
Peggotty
's
;
more
melancholy
*NL*
myself
,
if
possible
,
than
I
had
been
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
good
creature
--
I
mean
Peggotty
--
all
untired
by
her
late
anxieties
*NL*
and
sleepless
nights
,
was
at
her
brother
's
,
where
she
meant
to
stay
till
*NL*
morning
.
An
old
woman
,
who
had
been
employed
about
the
house
for
some
*NL*
weeks
past
,
while
Peggotty
had
been
unable
to
attend
to
it
,
was
the
*NL*
house
's
only
other
occupant
besides
myself
.
As
I
had
no
occasion
for
her
*NL*
services
,
I
sent
her
to
bed
,
by
no
means
against
her
will
;
and
sat
down
*NL*
before
the
kitchen
fire
a
little
while
,
to
think
about
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
blending
it
with
the
deathbed
of
the
late
Mr.
Barkis
,
and
was
*NL*
driving
out
with
the
tide
towards
the
distance
at
which
Ham
had
looked
*NL*
so
singularly
in
the
morning
,
when
I
was
recalled
from
my
wanderings
by
*NL*
a
knock
at
the
door
.
There
was
a
knocker
upon
the
door
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
that
which
made
the
sound
.
The
tap
was
from
a
hand
,
and
low
down
upon
*NL*
the
door
,
as
if
it
were
given
by
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
start
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
the
knock
of
a
footman
to
a
*NL*
person
of
distinction
.
I
opened
the
door
;
and
at
first
looked
down
,
to
*NL*
my
amazement
,
on
nothing
but
a
great
umbrella
that
appeared
to
be
*NL*
walking
about
of
itself
.
But
presently
I
discovered
underneath
it
,
Miss
*NL*
Mowcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
not
have
been
prepared
to
give
the
little
creature
a
very
kind
*NL*
reception
,
if
,
on
her
removing
the
umbrella
,
which
her
utmost
efforts
*NL*
were
unable
to
shut
up
,
she
had
shown
me
the
``
volatile
''
expression
of
*NL*
face
which
had
made
so
great
an
impression
on
me
at
our
first
and
last
*NL*
meeting
.
But
her
face
,
as
she
turned
it
up
to
mine
,
was
so
earnest
;
and
*NL*
when
I
relieved
her
of
the
umbrella
-LRB-
which
would
have
been
an
*NL*
inconvenient
one
for
the
Irish
Giant
-RRB-
,
she
wrung
her
little
hands
in
*NL*
such
an
afflicted
manner
;
that
I
rather
inclined
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Mowcher
!
''
said
I
,
after
glancing
up
and
down
the
empty
street
,
*NL*
without
distinctly
knowing
what
I
expected
to
see
besides
;
``
how
do
you
*NL*
come
here
?
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
motioned
to
me
,
with
her
short
right
arm
,
to
shut
the
umbrella
for
*NL*
her
;
and
passing
me
hurriedly
,
went
into
the
kitchen
.
When
I
had
closed
*NL*
the
door
,
and
followed
,
with
the
umbrella
in
my
hand
,
I
found
her
*NL*
sitting
on
the
corner
of
the
fender
--
it
was
a
low
iron
one
,
with
two
*NL*
flat
bars
at
top
to
stand
plates
upon
--
in
the
shadow
of
the
boiler
,
*NL*
swaying
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
chafing
her
hands
upon
her
*NL*
knees
like
a
person
in
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
alarmed
at
being
the
only
recipient
of
this
untimely
visit
,
and
*NL*
the
only
spectator
of
this
portentous
behaviour
,
I
exclaimed
again
:
*NL*
``
Pray
tell
me
,
Miss
Mowcher
,
what
is
the
matter
!
are
you
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
young
soul
,
''
returned
Miss
Mowcher
,
squeezing
her
hands
upon
*NL*
her
heart
one
over
the
other
.
``
I
am
ill
here
,
I
am
very
ill
.
To
think
*NL*
that
it
should
come
to
this
,
when
I
might
have
known
it
and
perhaps
*NL*
prevented
it
,
if
I
had
n't
been
a
thoughtless
fool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
her
large
bonnet
-LRB-
very
disproportionate
to
her
figure
-RRB-
went
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
,
in
her
swaying
of
her
little
body
to
and
fro
;
*NL*
while
a
most
gigantic
bonnet
rocked
,
in
unison
with
it
,
upon
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
surprised
,
''
I
began
,
``
to
see
you
so
distressed
and
serious
''
--
when
*NL*
she
interrupted
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
always
so
!
''
she
said
.
``
They
are
all
surprised
,
these
*NL*
inconsiderate
young
people
,
fairly
and
full
grown
,
to
see
any
natural
*NL*
feeling
in
a
little
thing
like
me
!
They
make
a
plaything
of
me
,
use
me
*NL*
for
their
amusement
,
throw
me
away
when
they
are
tired
,
and
wonder
that
*NL*
I
feel
more
than
a
toy
horse
or
a
wooden
soldier
!
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
the
*NL*
way
.
The
old
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
,
with
others
,
''
I
returned
,
``
but
I
do
assure
you
it
is
not
*NL*
with
me
.
Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
be
at
all
surprised
to
see
you
as
you
*NL*
are
now
:
I
know
so
little
of
you
.
I
said
,
without
consideration
,
what
I
*NL*
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
?
''
returned
the
little
woman
,
standing
up
,
and
holding
out
*NL*
her
arms
to
show
herself
.
``
See
!
What
I
am

my
father
was
;

my
sister

I

worked
for

many

years

hard

*NL*
*NL*
No

Not
Miss
Mowcher
's
,
I
perceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
shown
myself
a
sensitive
dwarf

pursued
*NL*
the
little
woman
,
shaking
her
head
at
me
,
with
reproachful
earnestness
,
*NL*
``
how
much

addressed
herself
to

because

misfortunes

you
suppose

small

Little
Mowcher

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mowcher
sat
down
on
the
fender
again
,
and
took
out
her
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
wiped
her
eyes

along
,
I
can
*NL*
throw
bubbles
back
.
If
I
do
n't
brood
over
all
I
want
,
it
is
the
better
*NL*
for
me
,
and
not
the
worse
for
any
one

If
I
am
a
plaything
for
you
*NL*
giants

be
gentle
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mowcher
replaced
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
,
looking
at
me
with
*NL*
very
intent
expression
all
the
while
,
and
pursued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
in
the
street
just
now
.
You
may
suppose
I
am
not
able
to
walk
*NL*
as
fast
as
you
,
with
my
short
legs
and
short
breath
,
and
I
could
n't
*NL*
overtake
you
;
but
I
guessed
where
you
came
,
and
came
after
you
.
I
have
*NL*
been
here
before
,
to-day
,
but
the
good
woman
was
n't
at
home

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
her
?
''
I
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
_
of
_
her
,
and
about
her
,
''
she
replied
,
``
from
Omer
and
Joram
.
I
*NL*
was
there
at
seven
o'clock
this
morning
.
Do
you
remember
what
Steerforth
*NL*
said
to
me
about
this
unfortunate
girl
,
that
time
when
I
saw
you
both
at
*NL*
the
inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
bonnet
on
Miss
Mowcher
's
head
,
and
the
greater
bonnet
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
began
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
again
when
she
asked
this
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
very
well
what
she
referred
to
,
having
had
it
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
many
times
that
day
.
I
told
her
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
Father
of
all
Evil
confound
him
,
''
said
the
little
woman
,
*NL*
holding
up
her
forefinger
between
me
and
her
sparkling
eyes
,
``
and
ten
*NL*
times
more
confound
that
wicked
servant
;
but
I
believed
it
was
_
you
_
who
*NL*
had
a
boyish
passion
for
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
,
child
!
In
the
name
of
blind
ill-fortune

''
cried
Miss
Mowcher
,
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
impatiently
,
as
she
went
to
and
fro
again
upon
the
*NL*
fender
,
``
why
did
you
praise
her
so
,
and
blush
,
and
look
disturbed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
conceal
from
myself
that
I
had
done
this
,
though
for
a
*NL*
reason
very
different
from
her
supposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
know
?
''
said
Miss
Mowcher
,
taking
out
her
handkerchief
again
,
*NL*
and
giving
one
little
stamp
on
the
ground
whenever
,
at
short
intervals
,
*NL*
she
applied
it
to
her
eyes
with
both
hands
at
once
.
``
He
was
crossing
you
*NL*
and
wheedling
you
,
I
saw
;
and
you
were
soft
wax
in
his
hands
,
I
saw
.
Had
*NL*
I
left
the
room
a
minute
,
when
his
man
told
me
that
`
Young
Innocence
'
*NL*
-LRB-
so
he
called
you
,
and
you
may
call
him
`
Old
Guilt
'
all
the
days
of
your
*NL*
life
-RRB-
had
set
his
heart
upon
her
,
and
she
was
giddy
and
liked
him
,
but
*NL*
his
master
was
resolved
that
no
harm
should
come
of
it
--
more
for
your
*NL*
sake
than
for
hers
--
and
that
that
was
their
business
here
?
How
could
I
*NL*
_
but
_
believe
him
?
I
saw
Steerforth
soothe
and
please
you
by
his
praise
*NL*
of
her
!
You
were
the
first
to
mention
her
name
.
You
owned
to
an
old
*NL*
admiration
of
her
.
You
were
hot
and
cold
,
and
red
and
white
,
all
at
once
*NL*
when
I
spoke
to
you
of
her
.
What
could
I
think
--
what
_
did
_
I
think
--
but
*NL*
that
you
were
a
young
libertine
in
everything
but
experience
,
and
had
*NL*
fallen
into
hands
that
had
experience
enough
,
and
could
manage
you
*NL*
-LRB-
having
the
fancy
-RRB-
for
your
own
good
?
Oh
!
oh
!
oh
!
They
were
afraid
of
my
*NL*
finding
out
the
truth
,
''
exclaimed
Miss
Mowcher
,
getting
off
the
fender
,
*NL*
and
trotting
up
and
down
the
kitchen
with
her
two
short
arms
*NL*
distressfully
lifted
up
,
``
because
I
am
a
sharp
little
thing
--
I
need
be
,
*NL*
to
get
through
the
world
at
all
!
--
and
they
deceived
me
altogether
,
and
I
*NL*
gave
the
poor
unfortunate
girl
a
letter
,
which
I
fully
believe
was
the
*NL*
beginning
of
her
ever
speaking
to
Littimer
,
who
was
left
behind
on
*NL*
purpose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
amazed
at
the
revelation
of
all
this
perfidy
,
looking
at
Miss
*NL*
Mowcher
as
she
walked
up
and
down
the
kitchen
until
she
was
out
of
*NL*
breath
:
when
she
sat
upon
the
fender
again
,
and
,
drying
her
face
with
*NL*
her
handkerchief
,
shook
her
head
for
a
long
time
,
without
otherwise
*NL*
moving
,
and
without
breaking
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
country
rounds
,
''
she
added
at
length
,
``
brought
me
to
Norwich
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield

night
before

What
I
happened
to
find
out
there
,
*NL*
about
their
secret
way
of
coming
and
going
,
without
you
--
which
was
*NL*
strange
--
led
to
my
suspecting
something
wrong
.
I
got
into
the
coach
from
*NL*
London
last
night
,
as
it
came
through
Norwich
,
and
was
here
this
*NL*
morning
.
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
too
late
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
little
Mowcher
turned
so
chilly
after
all
her
crying
and
fretting
,
*NL*
that
she
turned
round
on
the
fender
,
putting
her
poor
little
wet
feet
in
*NL*
among
the
ashes
to
warm
them
,
and
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
like
a
large
*NL*
doll
.
I
sat
in
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
,
lost
in
unhappy
*NL*
reflections
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
too
,
and
sometimes
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
rising
as
she
spoke
.
``
It
's
late
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
mistrust
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meeting
her
sharp
glance
,
which
was
as
sharp
as
ever
when
she
asked
me
,
*NL*
I
could
not
on
that
short
challenge
answer
no
,
quite
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
she
,
accepting
the
offer
of
my
hand
to
help
her
over
the
*NL*
fender
,
and
looking
wistfully
up
into
my
face
,
``
you
know
you
would
n't
*NL*
mistrust
me
,
if
I
was
a
full-sized
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
there
was
much
truth
in
this
;
and
I
felt
rather
ashamed
of
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
young
man
,
''
she
said
,
nodding
.
``
Take
a
word
of
advice
,
even
*NL*
from
three
foot
nothing

Try
not
to
associate
bodily
defects
with

mental
,
my
good
friend
,
except
for
a
solid
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
got
over
the
fender
now
,
and
I
had
got
over
my
suspicion
.
I
told
*NL*
her
that
I
believed
she
had
given
me
a
faithful
account
of
herself
,
and
*NL*
that
we
had
both
been
hapless
instruments
in
designing
hands
.
She
*NL*
thanked
me
,
and
said
I
was
a
good
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
mind
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
turning
back
on
her
way
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
looking
shrewdly
at
me
,
with
her
forefinger
up
again
.
``
I
have
some
*NL*
reason
to
suspect
,
from
what
I
have
heard
--
my
ears
are
always
open
;
I
*NL*
ca
n't
afford
to
spare
what
powers
I
have
--
that
they
are
gone
abroad
.
But
*NL*
if
ever
they
return
,
if
ever
any
one
of
them
returns
,
while
I
am
alive
,
*NL*
I
am
more
likely
than
another
,
going
about
as
I
do
,
to
find
it
out
soon
.
*NL*
Whatever
I
know
,
you
shall
know
.
If
ever
I
can
do
anything
to
serve
the
*NL*
poor
betrayed
girl
,
I
will
do
it
faithfully
,
please
Heaven
!
And
Littimer
*NL*
had
better
have
a
bloodhound
at
his
back
,
than
little
Mowcher
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
placed
implicit
faith
in
this
last
statement
,
when
I
marked
the
look
*NL*
with
which
it
was
accompanied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
me
no
more
,
but
trust
me
no
less
,
than
you
would
trust
a
*NL*
full-sized
woman

''
said
the
little
creature
,
touching
me
appealingly
on
*NL*
the
wrist
.
``
If
ever
you
see
me
again
,
unlike
what
I
am
now
,
and
like
*NL*
what
I
was
when
you
first
saw
me
,
observe
what
company
I
am
in
.
Call
to
*NL*
mind
that
I
am
a
very
helpless
and
defenceless
little
thing
.
Think
of
*NL*
me
at
home
with
my
brother
like
myself
and
sister
like
myself
,
when
my
*NL*
day
's
work
is
done
.
Perhaps
you
wo
n't
,
then
,
be
very
hard
upon
me
,
or
*NL*
surprised
if
I
can
be
distressed
and
serious
.
Good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
Miss
Mowcher
my
hand
,
with
a
very
different
opinion
of
her
from
*NL*
that
which
I
had
hitherto
entertained
,
and
opened
the
door
to
let
her
*NL*
out
.
It
was
not
a
trifling
business
to
get
the
great
umbrella
up
,
and
*NL*
properly
balanced
in
her
grasp
;
but
at
last
I
successfully
accomplished
*NL*
this
,
and
saw
it
go
bobbing
down
the
street
through
the
rain
,
without
*NL*
the
least
appearance
of
having
anybody
underneath
it
,
except
when
a
*NL*
heavier
fall
than
usual
from
some
overcharged
water-spout
sent
it
*NL*
toppling
over
,
on
one
side
,
and
discovered
Miss
Mowcher
struggling
*NL*
violently
to
get
it
right
.
After
making
one
or
two
sallies
to
her
*NL*
relief
,
which
were
rendered
futile
by
the
umbrella
's
hopping
on
again
,
*NL*
like
an
immense
bird
,
before
I
could
reach
it
,
I
came
in
,
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
and
slept
till
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
I
was
joined
by
Mr.
Peggotty
and
by
my
old
nurse
,
and
we
*NL*
went
at
an
early
hour
to
the
coach
office
,
where
Mrs.
Gummidge
and
Ham
*NL*
were
waiting
to
take
leave
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
Ham
whispered
,
drawing
me
aside
,
while
Mr.
Peggotty
was
*NL*
stowing
his
bag
among
the
luggage
,
``
his
life
is
quite
broke
up
.
He
*NL*
doe
n't
know
wheer
he
's
going
;
he
doe
n't
know
what
's
afore
him
;
he
's
*NL*
bound
upon
a
voyage
that
'll
last
,
on
and
off
,
all
the
rest
of
his
days
,
*NL*
take
my
wured
for
`
t
,
unless
he
finds
what
he
's
a
seeking
of
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
'll
be
a
friend
to
him
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
me
,
I
will
indeed
,
''
said
I
,
shaking
hands
with
Ham
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee

Thankee

very
kind

One

I

no
way

spending
what

*NL*
Money

of
no
use
to
me
no
more
,
except
to
live
.
If
you
can
lay
it
out
*NL*
for
him
,
I
shall
do
my
work
with
a
better
art
.
Though
as
to
that
,
sir
,

*NL*
and
he
spoke
very
steadily
and
mildly
,
``
you
're
not
to
think
but
I
shall
*NL*
work
at
all
times
,
like
a
man

and
act
the
best
that
lays
in
my
power
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
well
convinced
of
it
;
and
I
hinted
that
I
hoped
the
*NL*
time
might
even
come
,
when
he
would
cease
to
lead
the
lonely
life
he
*NL*
naturally
contemplated
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sir
,
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
all
that
's
past
and
over
with
me
,
*NL*
sir
.
No
one
can
never
fill
the
place
that
's
empty
.
But
you
'll
bear
in
*NL*
mind
about
the
money
,
as
theer
's
at
all
times
some
laying
by
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reminding
him
of
the
fact
,
that
Mr.
Peggotty
derived
a
steady
,
*NL*
though
certainly
a
very
moderate
income
from
the
bequest
of
his
late
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
I
promised
to
do
so
.
We
then
took
leave
of
each
other
.
*NL*
I
can
not
leave
him
,
even
now
,
without
remembering
with
a
pang
,
at
once
*NL*
his
modest
fortitude
and
his
great
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
if
I
were
to
endeavour
to
describe
how
she
ran
down
*NL*
the
street
by
the
side
of
the
coach
,
seeing
nothing
but
Mr.
Peggotty
on
*NL*
the
roof
,
through
the
tears
she
tried
to
repress
,
and
dashing
herself
*NL*
against
the
people
who
were
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
,
I
should
*NL*
enter
on
a
task
of
some
difficulty
.
Therefore
I
had
better
leave
her
*NL*
sitting
on
a
baker
's
door-step
,
out
of
breath
,
with
no
shape
at
all
*NL*
remaining
in
her
bonnet
,
and
one
of
her
shoes
off
,
lying
on
the
pavement
*NL*
at
a
considerable
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
to
our
journey
's
end
,
our
first
pursuit
was
to
look
about
*NL*
for
a
little
lodging
for
Peggotty
,
where
her
brother
could
have
a
*NL*
bed
.
We
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
one
,
of
a
very
clean
and
cheap
*NL*
description
,
over
a
chandler
's
shop
,
only
two
streets
removed
from
*NL*
me
.
When
we
had
engaged
this
domicile
,
I
bought
some
cold
meat
at
an
*NL*
eating-house
,
and
took
my
fellow-travellers
home
to
tea
;
a
proceeding
,
*NL*
I
regret
to
state
,
which
did
not
meet
with
Mrs.
Crupp
's
approval
,
but
*NL*
quite
the
contrary
.
I
ought
to
observe
,
however
,
in
explanation
of
that
*NL*
lady
's
state
of
mind
,
that
she
was
much
offended
by
Peggotty
's
tucking
*NL*
up
her
widow
's
gown
before
she
had
been
ten
minutes
in
the
place
,
and
*NL*
setting
to
work
to
dust
my
bed-room
.
This
Mrs.
Crupp
regarded
in
the
*NL*
light
of
a
liberty
,
and
a
liberty
,
she
said
,
was
a
thing
she
never
*NL*
allowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
had
made
a
communication
to
me
on
the
way
to
London
,
for
*NL*
which
I
was
not
unprepared
.
It
was
,
that
he
purposed
first
seeing
Mrs.
*NL*
Steerforth
.
As
I
felt
bound
to
assist
him
in
this
,
and
also
to
mediate
*NL*
between
them
;
with
the
view
of
sparing
the
mother
's
feelings
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
,
I
wrote
to
her
that
night
.
I
told
her
as
mildly
as
I
could
*NL*
what
his
wrong
was
,
and
what
my
own
share
in
his
injury
.
I
said
he
was
a
*NL*
man
in
very
common
life
,
but
of
a
most
gentle
and
upright
character
;
and
*NL*
that
I
ventured
to
express
a
hope
that
she
would
not
refuse
to
see
him
*NL*
in
his
heavy
trouble
.
I
mentioned
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
as
the
*NL*
hour
of
our
coming
,
and
I
sent
the
letter
myself
by
the
first
coach
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
time
,
we
stood
at
the
door
--
the
door
of
that
house
*NL*
where
I
had
been
,
a
few
days
since
,
so
happy
:
where
my
youthful
*NL*
confidence
and
warmth
of
heart
had
been
yielded
up
so
freely
:
which
was
*NL*
closed
against
me
henceforth
:
which
was
now
a
waste
,
a
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
Littimer
appeared
.
The
pleasanter
face
which
had
replaced
his
,
on
the
*NL*
occasion
of
my
last
visit
,
answered
to
our
summons
,
and
went
before
us
*NL*
to
the
drawing-room
.
Mrs.
Steerforth
was
sitting
there
.
Rosa
Dartle
*NL*
glided
,
as
we
went
in
,
from
another
part
of
the
room
,
and
stood
behind
*NL*
her
chair
.

*NL*

Illustration

Mr.
Peggotty
and
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
,
directly
,
in
his
mother
's
face
,
that
she
knew
from
himself
what
*NL*
he
had
done
.
It
was
very
pale
;
and
bore
the
traces
of
deeper
emotion
*NL*
than
my
letter
alone
,
weakened
by
the
doubts
her
fondness
would
have
*NL*
raised
upon
it
,
would
have
been
likely
to
create
.
I
thought
her
more
*NL*
like
him
than
ever
I
had
thought
her
;
and
I
felt
,
rather
than
saw
,
that
*NL*
the
resemblance
was
not
lost
on
my
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
upright
in
her
arm-chair
,
with
a
stately
,
immoveable
,
*NL*
passionless
air
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
disturb
.
She
looked
*NL*
very
stedfastly
at
Mr.
Peggotty
when
he
stood
before
her
;
and
he
looked
,
*NL*
quite
as
stedfastly
,
at
her
.
Rosa
Dartle
's
keen
glance
comprehended
all
*NL*
of
us
.
For
some
moments
not
a
word
was
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
motioned
to
Mr.
Peggotty
to
be
seated
.
He
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
I
*NL*
should
n't
feel
it
nat
`
ral
,
ma'am
,
to
sit
down
in
this
house
.
I
'd
sooner
*NL*
stand
.
''
And
this
was
succeeded
by
another
silence
,
which
she
broke
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
with
deep
regret
,
what
has
brought
you
here
.
What
do
you
want
*NL*
of
me
?
What
do
you
ask
me
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
and
feeling
in
his
breast
for
Emily
's
*NL*
letter
,
took
it
out
,
unfolded
it
,
and
gave
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
to
read
that
,
ma'am
.
That
's
my
niece
's
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
it
,
in
the
same
stately
and
impassive
way
,
--
untouched
by
its
*NL*
contents
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
--
and
returned
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Unless
he
brings
me
back
a
lady
,
'
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
tracing
out
that
*NL*
part
with
his
finger
.
``
I
come
to
know
,
ma'am
,
whether
he
will
keep
his
*NL*
wured
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
.
He
would
disgrace
himself
.
You
can
not
fail
to
know
*NL*
that
she
is
far
below
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Raise
her
up
!
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
uneducated
and
ignorant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
she
's
not
;
maybe
she
is
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
''
_
I
_
think
not
,
*NL*
ma'am
;
but
I
'm
no
judge
of
them
things
.
Teach
her
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
oblige
me
to
speak
more
plainly
,
which
I
am
very
unwilling
to
*NL*
do
,
her
humble
connexions
would
render
such
a
thing
impossible
,
if
*NL*
nothing
else
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
to
this
,
ma'am
,
''
he
returned
,
slowly
and
quietly
.
``
You
know
what
*NL*
it
is
to
love
your
child
.
So
do
I
.
If
she
was
a
hundred
times
my
child
,
*NL*
I
could
n't
love
her
more
.
You
doe
n't
know
what
it
is
to
lose
your
child

*NL*
I
do

All
the
heaps

wureld
would
be

to
me
-LRB-
if
they
*NL*
was
mine
-RRB-
to
buy
her
back
!
But
,
save
her
from
this
disgrace
,
and
she
*NL*
shall
never
be
disgraced
by
us
.
Not
one
of
us
that
she

growed
up
*NL*
among

not

that

lived
along

her
for

*NL*
all
in

will
ever

*NL*
We

we

be

off

was
underneath

we

be

trust

to

*NL*
*NL*
The
rugged
eloquence
with
which
he
spoke
,
was
not
devoid
of
all
effect
.
*NL*
She
still
preserved
her
proud
manner
,
but
there
was
a
touch
of
softness
*NL*
in
her
voice
,
as
she
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
justify
nothing
.
I
make
no
counter-accusations
.
But
I
am
sorry
to
*NL*
repeat
,
it
is
impossible
.
Such
a
marriage
would
irretrievably
blight
my
*NL*
son
's
career
,
and
ruin
his
prospects
.
Nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
*NL*
it
never
can
take
place
,
and
never
will
.
If
there
is
any
other
*NL*
compensation
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
looking
at
the
likeness
of
the
face
,
''
interrupted
Mr.
Peggotty
,
*NL*
with
a
steady
but
a
kindling
eye
,
``
that
has
looked
at
me
,
in
my
home
,
at
*NL*
my
fireside
,
in
my
boat
--
wheer
not
?
--
smiling
and
friendly
,
when
it
was
*NL*
so
treacherous
,
that
I
go
half
wild
when
I
think
of
it
.
If
the
likeness
*NL*
of
that
face
do
n't
turn
to
burning
fire
,
at
the
thought
of
offering
*NL*
money
to
me
for
my
child
's
blight
and
ruin
,
it
's
as
bad
.
I
doe
n't
know
,
*NL*
being
a
lady
's
,
but
what
it
's
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
changed
now
,
in
a
moment
.
An
angry
flush
overspread
her
features
;
*NL*
and
she
said
,
in
an
intolerant
manner
,
grasping
the
arm-chair
tightly
*NL*
with
her
hands
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
compensation
can
you
make
to
_
me
_
for
opening
such
a
pit
between
*NL*
me
and
my

What
is
your
love
to
mine
?
What
is
your
separation
to
*NL*
ours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
softly
touched
her
,
and
bent
down
her
head
to
whisper
,
but
*NL*
she
would
not
hear
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Rosa
,
not
a
word
!
Let
the
man
listen
to
what
I
say
!
My
son
,
who
has
*NL*
been
the
object
of
my
life
,
to
whom
its
every
thought
has
been
devoted
,
*NL*
whom
I
have
gratified
from
a
child
in
every
wish
,
from
whom
I
have
had
*NL*
no
separate
existence
since
his
birth
,
--
to
take
up
in
a
moment
with
a
*NL*
miserable
girl
,
and
avoid
me
!
To
repay
my
confidence
with
systematic
*NL*
deception
,
for
her
sake
,
and
quit
me
for
her
!
To
set
this
wretched
*NL*
fancy
,
against
his
mother
's
claims
upon
his
duty
,
love
,
respect
,
*NL*
gratitude
--
claims
that
every
day
and
hour
of
his
life
should
have
*NL*
strengthened
into
ties
that
nothing
could
be
proof
against
!
Is
this
no
*NL*
injury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Rosa
Dartle
tried
to
soothe
her
;
again
ineffectually
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Rosa
,
not
a
word
!
If
he
can
stake
his
all
upon
the
lightest
*NL*
object
,
I
can
stake
my
all
upon
a
greater
purpose
.
Let
him
go
where
he
*NL*
will
,
with
the
means
that
my
love
has
secured
to
him
!
Does
he
think
to
*NL*
reduce
me
by
long
absence
?
He
knows
his
mother
very
little
if
he
does
.
*NL*
Let
him
put
away
his
whim
now
,
and
he
is
welcome
back
.
Let
him
not
put
*NL*
her
away
now
,
and
he
never
shall
come
near
me
,
living
or
dying
,
while
I
*NL*
can
raise
my
hand
to
make
a
sign
against
it
,
unless
,
being
rid
of
her
*NL*
for
ever
,
he
comes
humbly
to
me
and
begs
for
my
forgiveness
.
This
is
my
*NL*
right
.
This
is
the
acknowledgment
I
_
will
have
_
.
This
is
the
separation
*NL*
that
there
is
between
us
!
And
is
this
,
''
she
added
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
visitor
with
the
proud
intolerant
air
with
which
she
had
begun
,
``
no
*NL*
injury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
heard
and
saw
the
mother
as
she
said
these
words
,
I
seemed
to
*NL*
hear
and
see
the
son
,
defying
them
.
All
that
I
had
ever
seen
in
him
of
*NL*
an
unyielding
,
wilful
spirit
,
I
saw
in
her
.
All
the
understanding
that
I
*NL*
had
now
of
his
misdirected
energy
,
became
an
understanding
of
her
*NL*
character
too
,
and
a
perception
that
it
was
,
in
its
strongest
springs
,
*NL*
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
observed
to
me
,
aloud
,
resuming
her
former
restraint
,
that
it
*NL*
was
useless
to
hear
more
,
or
to
say
more
,
and
that
she
begged
to
put
an
*NL*
end
to
the
interview
.
She
rose
with
an
air
of
dignity
to
leave
the
room
,
*NL*
when
Mr.
Peggotty
signified
that
it
was
needless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doe
n't
fear
me
being
any
hindrance
to
you
,
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
''
he
remarked
,
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
.
``
I
come
heer
with
no
*NL*
hope
,
and
I
take
away
no
hope

I
have
done
what
I
thowt
should
be
done
,
*NL*
but
I
never
looked
fur
any
good
to
come
of
my
stan
`

where
I
do
.
This
*NL*
has
been
too
evil
a
house
fur
me

mine

fur
me
to
be
in
my
right
*NL*
senses

expect
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
we
departed
;
leaving
her
standing
by
her
elbow
chair
,
a
*NL*
picture
of
a
noble
presence
and
a
handsome
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
,
on
our
way
out
,
to
cross
a
paved
hall
,
with
glass
sides
and
*NL*
roof
,
over
which
a
vine
was
trained
.
Its
leaves
and
shoots
were
green
*NL*
then
,
and
the
day
being
sunny
,
a
pair
of
glass
doors
leading
to
the
*NL*
garden
were
thrown
open
.
Rosa
Dartle
,
entering
this
way
with
a
noiseless
*NL*
step
,
when
we
were
close
to
them
,
addressed
herself
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
well
,
''
she
said
,
``
indeed
,
to
bring
this
fellow
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
concentration
of
rage
and
scorn
as
darkened
her
face
,
and
flashed
*NL*
in
her
jet-black
eyes
,
I
could
not
have
thought
compressible
even
into
*NL*
that
face
.
The
scar
made
by
the
hammer
was
,
as
usual
in
this
excited
*NL*
state
of
her
features
,
strongly
marked
.
When
the
throbbing
I
had
seen
*NL*
before
,
came
into
it
as
I
looked
at
her
,
she
absolutely
lifted
up
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
struck
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
fellow
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
champion
and
bring
here
,
is
he
not
?
*NL*
You
are
a
true
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dartle
,
''
I
returned
,
``
you
are
surely
not
so
unjust
as
to
condemn
*NL*
_
me

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
bring
division
between
these
two
mad
creatures
?
''
she
*NL*
returned
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
that
they
are
both
mad
with
their
own
*NL*
self-will
and
pride
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
my
doing
?
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your
doing
!
''
she
retorted
.
``
Why
do
you
bring
this
man
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
deeply-injured
man

Miss
Dartle

I
replied
.
``
You
may
not
know
*NL*
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
James
Steerforth

she
said
,
with
her
hand
on
her
bosom
,
as
*NL*
if
to
prevent
the
storm
that
was
raging
there
,
from
being
loud
,
``
has
a
*NL*
false

corrupt
heart

a
traitor

But
what
need
I
know

about
this
fellow

and
his
common
niece
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dartle
,
''
I
returned
,
``
you
deepen
the
injury
.
It
is
sufficient
*NL*
already
.
I
will
only
say
,
at
parting
,
that
you
do
him
a
great
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
him
no
wrong
,
''
she
returned
.
``
They
are
a
depraved
worthless
set
.
I
*NL*
would
have
her
whipped
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
passed
on
,
without
a
word
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shame
,
Miss
Dartle
!
shame
!
''
I
said
indignantly
.
``
How
can
you
bear
*NL*
to
trample
on
his
undeserved
affliction
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
trample
on
them
all
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
would
have
his
house
*NL*
pulled
down
.
I
would
have
her
branded
on
the
face
,
drest
in
rags
,
and
*NL*
cast
out
in
the
streets
to
starve
.
If
I
had
the
power
to
sit
in
judgment
*NL*
on
her
,
I
would
see
it
done
.
See
it
done
?
I
would
do
it
!
I
detest
her
.
*NL*
If
I
ever
could
reproach
her
with
her
infamous
condition
,
I
would
go
*NL*
anywhere
to
do
so
.
If
I
could
hunt
her
to
her
grave
,
I
would
.
If
there
*NL*
was
any
word
of
comfort
that
would
be
a
solace
to
her
in
her
dying
hour
,
*NL*
and
only
I
possessed
it
,
I
would
n't
part
with
it
for
Life
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mere
vehemence
of
her
words
can
convey
,
I
am
sensible
,
but
a
weak
*NL*
impression
of
the
passion
by
which
she
was
possessed
,
and
which
made
*NL*
itself
articulate
in
her
whole
figure
,
though
her
voice
,
instead
of
*NL*
being
raised
,
was
lower
than
usual
.
No
description
I
could
give
of
her
*NL*
would
do
justice
to
my
recollection
of
her
,
or
to
her
entire
deliverance
*NL*
of
herself
to
her
anger
.
I
have
seen
passion
in
many
forms
,
but
I
have
*NL*
never
seen
it
in
such
a
form
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
joined
Mr.
Peggotty
,
he
was
walking
slowly
and
thoughtfully
down
*NL*
the
hill
.
He
told
me
,
as
soon
as
I
came
up
with
him
,
that
having
now
*NL*
discharged
his
mind
of
what
he
had
purposed
doing
in
London
,
he
meant
*NL*
``
to
set
out
on
his
travels
,
''
that
night
.
I
asked
him
where
he
meant
to
*NL*
go
?
He
only
answered
,
``
I
'm
a
going
,
sir
,
to
seek
my
niece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
back
to
the
little
lodging
over
the
chandler
's
shop
,
and
there
I
*NL*
found
an
opportunity
of
repeating
to
Peggotty
what
he
had
said
to
me
.
*NL*
She
informed
me
,
in
return
,
that
he
had
said
the
same
to
her
that
*NL*
morning
.
She
knew
no
more
than
I
did
,
where
he
was
going
,
but
she
*NL*
thought
he
had
some
project
shaped
out
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
like
to
leave
him
,
under
such
circumstances
,
and
we
all
three
*NL*
dined
together
off
a
beefsteak
pie
--
which
was
one
of
the
many
good
*NL*
things
for
which
Peggotty
was
famous
--
and
which
was
curiously
flavoured
*NL*
on
this
occasion
,
I
recollect
well
,
by
a
miscellaneous
taste
of
tea
,
*NL*
coffee
,
butter
,
bacon
,
cheese
,
new
loaves
,
firewood
,
candles
,
and
walnut
*NL*
ketchup
,
continually
ascending
from
the
shop
.
After
dinner
we
sat
for
an
*NL*
hour
or
so
near
the
window
,
without
talking
much
;
and
then
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
got
up
,
and
brought
his
oilskin
bag
and
his
stout
stick
,
and
laid
them
*NL*
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accepted
,
from
his
sister
's
stock
of
ready
money
,
a
small
sum
on
*NL*
account
of
his
legacy
;
barely
enough
,
I
should
have
thought
,
to
keep
him
*NL*
for
a
month
.
He
promised
to
communicate
with
me
,
when
anything
befel
*NL*
him
;
and
he
slung
his
bag
about
him
,
took
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
bade
us
*NL*
both
``
Good
bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
good
attend
you
,
dear
old
woman
,
''
he
said
,
embracing
Peggotty
,
``
and
*NL*
you
too
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
''
shaking
hands
with
me
.
``
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
her
,
*NL*
fur
and
wide
.
If
she
should
come
home
while
I
'm
away
,
--
but
ah
,
that
*NL*
ai
n't
like
to
be
!
--
or
if
I
should
bring
her
back
,
my
meaning
is
,
that
*NL*
she
and
me
shall
live
and
die
where
no
one
ca
n't
reproach
her
.
If
any
*NL*
hurt
should
come
to
me
,
remember
that
the
last
words
I
left
for
her
was
,
*NL*
`
My
unchanged
love
is
with
my
darling
child
,
and
I
forgive
her
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
solemnly
,
bare-headed
;
then
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
he
went
*NL*
down
the
stairs
,
and
away
.
We
followed
to
the
door
.
It
was
a
warm
,
dusty
*NL*
evening
,
just
the
time
when
,
in
the
great
main
thoroughfare
out
of
which
*NL*
that
bye-way
turned
,
there
was
a
temporary
lull
in
the
eternal
tread
of
*NL*
feet
upon
the
pavement
,
and
a
strong
red
sunshine
.
He
turned
,
alone
,
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
our
shady
street
,
into
a
glow
of
light
,
in
which
we
lost
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rarely
did
that
hour
of
the
evening
come
,
rarely
did
I
wake
at
night
,
*NL*
rarely
did
I
look
up
at
the
moon
,
or
stars
,
or
watch
the
falling
rain
,
*NL*
or
hear
the
wind
,
but
I
thought
of
his
solitary
figure
toiling
on
,
poor
*NL*
pilgrim
,
and
recalled
the
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
her
,
fur
and
wide
.
If
any
hurt
should
come
to
me
,
*NL*
remember
that
the
last
words
I
left
for
her
was
,
`
My

CHAPTER
XXXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
BLISSFUL
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
I
had
gone
on
loving
Dora
,
harder
than
ever
.
Her
idea
was
*NL*
my
refuge
in
disappointment
and
distress
,
and
made
some
amends
to
me
,
*NL*
even
for
the
loss
of
my
friend
.
The
more
I
pitied
myself
,
or
pitied
*NL*
others
,
the
more
I
sought
for
consolation
in
the
image
of
Dora
.
The
*NL*
greater
the
accumulation
of
deceit
and
trouble
in
the
world
,
the
*NL*
brighter
and
the
purer
shone
the
star
of
Dora
high
above
the
world
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
had
any
definite
idea
where
Dora
came
from
,
or
in
what
*NL*
degree
she
was
related
to
a
higher
order
of
beings
;
but
I
am
quite
sure
*NL*
I
should
have
scouted
the
notion
of
her
being
simply
human
,
like
any
*NL*
other
young
lady
,
with
indignation
and
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
may
so
express
it
,
I
was
steeped
in
Dora
.
I
was
not
merely
over
*NL*
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
,
but
I
was
saturated
through
and
through
.
*NL*
Enough
love
might
have
been
wrung
out
of
me
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
to
*NL*
drown
anybody
in
;
and
yet
there
would
have
remained
enough
within
me
,
*NL*
and
all
over
me
,
to
pervade
my
entire
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
I
did
,
on
my
own
account
,
when
I
came
back
,
was
to
take
*NL*
a
night-walk
to
Norwood
,
and
,
like
the
subject
of
a
venerable
riddle
of
*NL*
my
childhood
to
go
``
round
and
round
the
house
,
without
ever
touching
the
*NL*
house
,
''
thinking
about
Dora
.
I
believe
the
theme
of
this
*NL*
incomprehensible
conundrum
was
the
moon
.
No
matter
what
it
was
,
I
,
the
*NL*
moon-struck
slave
of
Dora
,
perambulated
round
and
round
the
house
and
*NL*
garden
for
two
hours
,
looking
through
crevices
in
the
palings
,
getting
*NL*
my
chin
by
dint
of
violent
exertion
above
the
rusty
nails
on
the
top
,
*NL*
blowing
kisses
at
the
lights
in
the
windows
,
and
romantically
calling
on
*NL*
the
night
,
at
intervals
,
to
shield
my
Dora
--
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
*NL*
from
,
I
suppose
from
fire
.
Perhaps
from
mice
,
to
which
she
had
a
great
*NL*
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
love
was
so
much
on
my
mind
,
and
it
was
so
natural
to
me
to
confide
*NL*
in
Peggotty
,
when
I
found
her
again
by
my
side
of
an
evening
with
the
*NL*
old
set
of
industrial
implements
,
busily
making
the
tour
of
my
wardrobe
,
*NL*
that
I
imparted
to
her
,
in
a
sufficiently
roundabout
way
,
my
great
*NL*
secret
.
Peggotty
was
strongly
interested
,
but
I
could
not
get
her
into
*NL*
my
view
of
the
case
at
all
.
She
was
audaciously
prejudiced
in
my
favour
,
*NL*
and
quite
unable
to
understand
why
I
should
have
any
misgivings
,
or
be
*NL*
low-spirited
about
it
.
`
The
young
lady
might
think
herself
well
off
,
'
*NL*
she
observed
,
`
to
have
such
a
beau
.
And
as
to
her
Pa
,
'
she
said
,
`
what
*NL*
_
did
_
the
gentleman
expect
,
for
gracious
sake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
observed
,
however
,
that
Mr.
Spenlow
's
Proctorial
gown
and
stiff
cravat
*NL*
took
Peggotty
down
a
little
,
and
inspired
her
with
a
greater
reverence
*NL*
for
the
man
who
was
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
etherealized
in
my
*NL*
eyes
every
day
,
and
about
whom
a
reflected
radiance
seemed
to
me
to
beam
*NL*
when
he
sat
erect
in
Court
among
his
papers
,
like
a
little
light-house
*NL*
in
a
sea
of
stationery
.
And
by-the-by
,
it
used
to
be
uncommonly
strange
*NL*
to
me
to
consider
,
I
remember
,
as
I
sat
in
Court
too
,
how
those
dim
old
*NL*
judges
and
doctors
would
n't
have
cared
for
Dora
,
if
they
had
known
her
;
*NL*
how
they
would
n't
have
gone
out
of
their
senses
with
rapture
,
if
*NL*
marriage
with
Dora
had
been
proposed
to
them
;
how
Dora
might
have
sung
,
*NL*
and
played
upon
that
glorified
guitar
,
until
she
led
_
me
_
to
the
verge
*NL*
of
madness
,
yet
not
have
tempted
one
of
those
slow-goers
an
inch
out
of
*NL*
his
road
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
despised
them
,
to
a
man
.
Frozen-out
old
gardeners
in
the
flower-beds
*NL*
of
the
heart
,
I
took
a
personal
offence
against
them
all
.
The
Bench
was
*NL*
nothing
to
me
but
an
insensible
blunderer
.
The
Bar
had
no
more
*NL*
tenderness
or
poetry
in
it
,
than
the
Bar
of
a
public-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
management
of
Peggotty
's
affairs
into
my
own
hands
,
with
no
*NL*
little
pride
,
I
proved
the
will
,
and
came
to
a
settlement
with
the
*NL*
Legacy
Duty-office
,
and
took
her
to
the
Bank
,
and
soon
got
everything
*NL*
into
an
orderly
train
.
We
varied
the
legal
character
of
these
*NL*
proceedings
by
going
to
see
some
perspiring
Wax-work
,
in
Fleet
Street
*NL*
-LRB-
melted
,
I
should
hope
,
these
twenty
years
-RRB-
;
and
by
visiting
Miss
*NL*
Linwood
's
Exhibition
,
which
I
remember
as
a
Mausoleum
of
needlework
,
*NL*
favorable
to
self-examination
and
repentance
;
and
by
inspecting
the
*NL*
Tower
of
London
;
and
going
to
the
top
of
St.
Paul
's
.
All
these
wonders
*NL*
afforded
Peggotty
as
much
pleasure
as
she
was
able
to
enjoy
,
under
*NL*
existing
circumstances
:
except
,
I
think
,
St.
Paul
's
,
which
,
from
her
*NL*
long
attachment
to
her
workbox
,
became
a
rival
of
the
picture
on
the
*NL*
lid
,
and
was
,
in
some
particulars
,
vanquished
,
she
considered
,
by
that
*NL*
work
of
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
's
business
,
which
was
what
we
used
to
call
``
common
form
*NL*
business
''
in
the
Commons
-LRB-
and
very
light
and
lucrative
the
common-form
*NL*
business
was
-RRB-
,
being
settled
,
I
took
her
down
to
the
office
one
morning
*NL*
to
pay
her
bill
.
Mr.
Spenlow
had
stepped
out
,
old
Tiffey
said
,
to
get
*NL*
a
gentleman
sworn
for
a
marriage
license
;
but
as
I
knew
he
would
be
*NL*
back
directly
,
our
place
lying
close
to
the
Surrogate
's
,
and
to
the
*NL*
Vicar-General
's
office
too
,
I
told
Peggotty
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
a
little
like
undertakers
,
in
the
Commons
,
as
regarded
Probate
*NL*
transactions
;
generally
making
it
a
rule
to
look
more
or
less
cut
up
,
*NL*
when
we
had
to
deal
with
clients
in
mourning
.
In
a
similar
feeling
of
*NL*
delicacy
,
we
were
always
blithe
and
light-hearted
with
the
license
*NL*
clients
.
Therefore
I
hinted
to
Peggotty
that
she
would
find
Mr.
Spenlow
*NL*
much
recovered
from
the
shock
of
Mr.
Barkis
's
decease
;
and
indeed
he
*NL*
came
in
like
a
bridegroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
Peggotty
nor
I
had
eyes
for
him
,
when
we
saw
,
in
company
*NL*
with
him
,
Mr.
Murdstone
.
He
was
very
little
changed
.
His
hair
looked
as
*NL*
thick
,
and
was
certainly
as
black
,
as
ever
;
and
his
glance
was
as
little
*NL*
to
be
trusted
as
of
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Copperfield
?
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
``
You
know
this
gentleman
,
I
*NL*
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
my
gentleman
a
distant
bow
,
and
Peggotty
barely
recognised
him
.
*NL*
He
was
,
at
first
,
somewhat
disconcerted
to
meet
us
two
together
;
but
*NL*
quickly
decided
what
to
do
,
and
came
up
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
you
are
doing
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
hardly
be
interesting
to
you
,
''
said
I.
``
Yes
,
if
you
wish
to
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
at
each
other
,
and
he
addressed
himself
to
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
am
sorry
to
observe
that
you
have
lost
your
*NL*
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
first
loss
I
have
had
in
my
life
,
Mr.
Murdstone
,
''
replied
*NL*
Peggotty
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
.
``
I
am
glad
to
hope
that
there
is
*NL*
nobody
to
blame
for
this
one
,
--
nobody
to
answer
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
said
he
;
``
that
's
a
comfortable
reflection
.
You
have
done
your
*NL*
duty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
worn
any
body
's
life
away
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
I
am
thankful
to
*NL*
think
!
No
,
Mr.
Murdstone
,
I
have
not
worrited
and
frightened
any
sweet
*NL*
creetur
to
an
early
grave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
eyed
her
gloomily
--
remorsefully
I
thought
--
for
an
instant
;
and
said
,
*NL*
turning
his
head
towards
me
,
but
looking
at
my
feet
instead
of
my
face
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
likely
to
encounter
soon
again
;
--
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
*NL*
us
both
,
no
doubt
,
for
such
meetings
as
this
can
never
be
agreeable
.
I
*NL*
do
not
expect
that
you
,
who
always
rebelled
against
my
just
authority
,
*NL*
exerted
for
your
benefit
and
reformation
,
should
owe
me
any
good
will
*NL*
now
.
There
is
an
antipathy
between
us
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
one
,
I
believe
?
''
said
I
,
interrupting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
and
shot
as
evil
a
glance
at
me
as
could
come
from
his
dark
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
rankled
in
your
baby
breast
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
embittered
the
life
of
*NL*
your
poor
mother
.
You
are
right
.
I
hope
you
may
do
better
,
yet
;
I
hope
*NL*
you
may
correct
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
ended
the
dialogue
,
which
had
been
carried
on
in
a
low
voice
,
in
*NL*
a
corner
of
the
outer
office
,
by
passing
into
Mr.
Spenlow
's
room
,
and
*NL*
saying
aloud
,
in
his
smoothest
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
Mr.
Spenlow
's
profession
are
accustomed
to
family
*NL*
differences
,
and
know
how
complicated
and
difficult
they
always
are
!
''
*NL*
With
that
,
he
paid
the
money
for
his
license
;
and
,
receiving
it
neatly
*NL*
folded
from
Mr.
Spenlow
,
together
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
a
polite
*NL*
wish
for
his
happiness
and
the
lady
's
,
went
out
of
the
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
had
more
difficulty
in
constraining
myself
to
be
silent
*NL*
under
his
words
,
if
I
had
had
less
difficulty
in
impressing
upon
*NL*
Peggotty
-LRB-
who
was
only
angry
on
my
account
,
good
creature
!
-RRB-
that
we
were
*NL*
not
in
a
place
for
recrimination
,
and
that
I
besought
her
to
hold
her
*NL*
peace
.
She
was
so
unusually
roused
,
that
I
was
glad
to
compound
for
an
*NL*
affectionate
hug
,
elicited
by
this
revival
in
her
mind
of
our
old
*NL*
injuries
,
and
to
make
the
best
I
could
of
it
,
before
Mr.
Spenlow
and
the
*NL*
clerks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
did
not
appear
to
know
what
the
connexion
between
Mr.
*NL*
Murdstone
and
myself
was
;
which
I
was
glad
of
,
for
I
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
acknowledge
him
,
even
in
my
own
breast
,
remembering
what
I
did
of
the
*NL*
history
of
my
poor
mother
.
Mr.
Spenlow
seemed
to
think
,
if
he
thought
*NL*
anything
about
the
matter
,
that
my
aunt
was
the
leader
of
the
state
*NL*
party
in
our
family
,
and
that
there
was
a
rebel
party
commanded
by
*NL*
somebody
else
--
so
I
gathered
at
least
from
what
he
said
,
while
we
were
*NL*
waiting
for
Mr.
Tiffey
to
make
out
Peggotty
's
bill
of
costs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
he
remarked
,
``
is
very
firm
,
no
doubt
,
and
not
likely
to
*NL*
give
way
to
opposition
.
I
have
an
admiration
for
her
character
,
and
I
*NL*
may
congratulate
you
,
Copperfield
,
on
being
on
the
right
side
.
*NL*
Differences
between
relations
are
much
to
be
deplored
--
but
they
are
*NL*
extremely
general
--
and
the
great
thing
is
,
to
be
on
the
right
side
:
''
*NL*
meaning
,
I
take
it
,
on
the
side
of
the
moneyed
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
a
good
marriage
this
,
I
believe
?
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
that
I
knew
nothing
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
he
said
.
``
Speaking
from
the
few
words
Mr.
Murdstone
*NL*
dropped
--
as
a
man
frequently
does
on
these
occasions
--
and
from
what
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
let
fall
,
I
should
say
it
was
rather
a
good
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
there
is
money
,
sir
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
``
I
understand
there
's
money
.
Beauty
too
,
I
am
*NL*
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
Is
his
new
wife
young
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
of
age
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
``
So
lately
,
that
I
should
think
they
*NL*
had
been
waiting
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
deliver
her
!
''
said
Peggotty
.
So
very
emphatically
and
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
that
we
were
all
three
discomposed
;
until
Tiffey
came
in
*NL*
with
the
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Tiffey
soon
appeared
,
however
,
and
handed
it
to
Mr.
Spenlow
,
to
look
*NL*
over
.
Mr.
Spenlow
,
settling
his
chin
in
his
cravat
and
rubbing
it
*NL*
softly
,
went
over
the
items
with
a
deprecatory
air
--
as
if
it
were
all
*NL*
Jorkins
's
doing
--
and
handed
it
back
to
Tiffey
with
a
bland
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
's
right
.
Quite
right
.
I
should
have
been
extremely
*NL*
happy
,
Copperfield
,
to
have
limited
these
charges
to
the
actual
*NL*
expenditure
out
of
pocket
;
but
it
is
an
irksome
incident
in
my
*NL*
professional
life
,
that
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
consult
my
own
wishes
.
I
*NL*
have
a
partner
--
Mr.
Jorkins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
with
a
gentle
melancholy
,
which
was
the
next
thing
to
*NL*
making
no
charge
at
all
,
I
expressed
my
acknowledgments
on
Peggotty
's
*NL*
behalf
,
and
paid
Tiffey
in
bank
notes
.
Peggotty
then
retired
to
*NL*
her
lodging
,
and
Mr.
Spenlow
and
I
went
into
Court
,
where
we
had
a
*NL*
divorce-suit
coming
on
,
under
an
ingenious
little
statute
-LRB-
repealed
*NL*
now
,
I
believe
,
but
in
virtue
of
which
I
have
seen
several
marriages
*NL*
annulled
-RRB-
,
of
which
the
merits
were
these
.
The
husband
,
whose
name
*NL*
was
Thomas
Benjamin
,
had
taken
out
his
marriage
license
as
Thomas
*NL*
only
;
suppressing
the
Benjamin
,
in
case
he
should
not
find
himself
as
*NL*
comfortable
as
he
expected
.
_
Not
_
finding
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
*NL*
expected
,
or
being
a
little
fatigued
with
his
wife
,
poor
fellow
,
he
*NL*
now
came
forward
by
a
friend
,
after
being
married
a
year
or
two
,
and
*NL*
declared
that
his
name
was
Thomas
Benjamin
,
and
therefore
he
was
not
*NL*
married
at
all
.
Which
the
Court
confirmed
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
say
that
I
had
my
doubts
about
the
strict
justice
of
this
,
and
*NL*
was
not
even
frightened
out
of
them
by
the
bushel
of
wheat
which
*NL*
reconciles
all
anomalies
.
But
Mr.
Spenlow
argued
the
matter
with
me
.
He
*NL*
said
,
Look
at
the
world
,
there
was
good
and
evil
in
that
;
look
at
the
*NL*
ecclesiastical
law
,
there
was
good
and
evil
in
_
that
_
.
It
was
all
part
*NL*
of
a
system
.
Very
good
.
There
you
were
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
the
hardihood
to
suggest
to
Dora
's
father
that
possibly
we
*NL*
might
even
improve
the
world
a
little
,
if
we
got
up
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
took
off
our
coats
to
the
work
;
but
I
confessed
that
I
*NL*
thought
we
might
improve
the
Commons
.
Mr.
Spenlow
replied
that
he
would
*NL*
particularly
advise
me
to
dismiss
that
idea
from
my
mind
,
as
not
being
*NL*
worthy
of
my
gentlemanly
character
;
but
that
he
would
be
glad
to
hear
*NL*
from
me
of
what
improvement
I
thought
the
Commons
susceptible
?
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
that
part
of
the
Commons
which
happened
to
be
nearest
to
us
--
for
*NL*
our
man
was
unmarried
by
this
time
,
and
we
were
out
of
Court
,
and
*NL*
strolling
past
the
Prerogative
Office
--
I
submitted
that
I
thought
the
*NL*
Prerogative
Office
rather
a
queerly
managed
institution
.
Mr.
Spenlow
*NL*
inquired
in
what
respect
?
I
replied
,
with
all
due
deference
to
his
*NL*
experience
-LRB-
but
with
more
deference
,
I
am
afraid
,
to
his
being
Dora
's
*NL*
father
-RRB-
,
that
perhaps
it
was
a
little
nonsensical
that
the
Registry
of
*NL*
that
Court
,
containing
the
original
wills
of
all
persons
leaving
effects
*NL*
within
the
immense
province
of
Canterbury
,
for
three
whole
centuries
,
*NL*
should
be
an
accidental
building
,
never
designed
for
the
purpose
,
leased
*NL*
by
the
registrars
for
their
own
private
emolument
,
unsafe
,
not
even
*NL*
ascertained
to
be
fire-proof
,
choked
with
the
important
documents
it
*NL*
held
,
and
positively
,
from
the
roof
to
the
basement
,
a
mercenary
*NL*
speculation
of
the
registrars
,
who
took
great
fees
from
the
public
,
and
*NL*
crammed
the
public
's
wills
away
anyhow
and
anywhere
,
having
no
other
*NL*
object
than
to
get
rid
of
them
cheaply
.
That
,
perhaps
,
it
was
a
little
*NL*
unreasonable
that
these
registrars
in
the
receipt
of
profits
amounting
*NL*
to
eight
or
nine
thousand
pounds
a
year
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
the
profits
*NL*
of
the
deputy
registrars
,
and
clerks
of
seats
-RRB-
,
should
not
be
obliged
to
*NL*
spend
a
little
of
that
money
,
in
finding
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
the
*NL*
important
documents
which
all
classes
of
people
were
compelled
to
hand
*NL*
over
to
them
,
whether
they
would
or
no
.
That
,
perhaps
,
it
was
a
little
*NL*
unjust
that
all
the
great
offices
in
this
great
office
,
should
be
*NL*
magnificent
sinecures
,
while
the
unfortunate
working-clerks
in
the
cold
*NL*
dark
room
up-stairs
were
the
worst
rewarded
,
and
the
least
considered
*NL*
men
,
doing
important
services
,
in
London
.
That
perhaps
it
was
a
little
*NL*
indecent
that
the
principal
registrar
of
all
,
whose
duty
it
was
to
find
*NL*
the
public
,
constantly
resorting
to
this
place
,
all
needful
*NL*
accommodation
,
should
be
an
enormous
sinecurist
in
virtue
of
that
post
*NL*
-LRB-
and
might
be
,
besides
,
a
clergyman
,
a
pluralist
,
the
holder
of
a
stall
*NL*
in
a
cathedral
,
and
what
not
-RRB-
,
--
while
the
public
was
put
to
the
*NL*
inconvenience
of
which
we
had
a
specimen
every
afternoon
when
the
office
*NL*
was
busy
,
and
which
we
knew
to
be
quite
monstrous
.
That
,
perhaps
,
in
*NL*
short
,
this
Prerogative
Office
of
the
diocese
of
Canterbury
was
*NL*
altogether
such
a
pestilent
job
,
and
such
a
pernicious
absurdity
,
that
*NL*
but
for
its
being
squeezed
away
,
in
a
corner
of
Saint
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
*NL*
which
few
people
knew
,
it
must
have
been
turned
completely
inside
out
,
*NL*
and
upside
down
,
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
smiled
as
I
became
modestly
warm
on
the
subject
,
and
then
*NL*
argued
this
question
with
me
as
he
had
argued
the
other
.
He
said
,
what
*NL*
was
it
after
all
?
It
was
a
question
of
feeling
.
If
the
public
felt
that
*NL*
their
wills
were
in
safe
keeping
,
and
took
it
for
granted
that
the
*NL*
office
was
not
to
be
made
better
,
who
was
the
worse
for
it
?
Nobody
?
Who
*NL*
was
the
better
for
it
?
All
the
Sinecurists
.
Very
well
.
Then
the
good
*NL*
predominated
.
It
might
not
be
a
perfect
system
;
nothing
_
was
_
perfect
;
*NL*
but
what
he
objected
to
,
was
,
the
insertion
of
the
wedge
.
Under
the
*NL*
Prerogative
Office
,
the
country
had
been
glorious
.
Insert
the
wedge
into
*NL*
the
Prerogative
Office
,
and
the
country
would
cease
to
be
glorious
.
He
*NL*
considered
it
the
principle
of
a
gentleman
to
take
things
as
he
found
*NL*
them
;
and
he
had
no
doubt
the
Prerogative
Office
would
last
our
time
.
I
*NL*
deferred
to
his
opinion
,
though
I
had
great
doubts
of
it
myself
.
I
find
*NL*
he
was
right
,
however
;
for
it
has
not
only
lasted
to
the
present
moment
,
*NL*
but
has
done
so
in
the
teeth
of
a
great
parliamentary
report
made
-LRB-
not
*NL*
too
willingly
-RRB-
eighteen
years
ago
,
when
all
these
objections
of
mine
*NL*
were
set
forth
in
detail
,
and
when
the
existing
stowage
for
wills
was
*NL*
described
as
equal
to
the
accumulation
of
only
two
years
and
a
half
*NL*
more
.
What
they
have
done
with
them
since
;
whether
they
have
lost
many
,
*NL*
or
whether
they
sell
any
,
now
and
then
,
to
the
butter
shops
;
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
I
am
glad
mine
is
not
there
,
and
I
hope
it
may
not
go
there
,
yet
*NL*
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
set
all
this
down
,
in
my
present
blissful
chapter
,
because
here
*NL*
it
comes
into
its
natural
place
.
Mr.
Spenlow
and
I
falling
into
this
*NL*
conversation
,
prolonged
it
and
our
saunter
to
and
fro
,
until
we
diverged
*NL*
into
general
topics
.
And
so
it
came
about
,
in
the
end
,
that
Mr.
Spenlow
*NL*
told
me
this
day
week
was
Dora
's
birthday
,
and
he
would
be
glad
if
I
*NL*
would
come
down
and
join
a
little
pic-nic
on
the
occasion
.
I
went
out
of
*NL*
my
senses
immediately
;
became
a
mere
driveller
next
day
,
on
receipt
of
a
*NL*
little
lace-edged
sheet
of
note
paper
,
``
Favoured
by
papa
.
To
remind
;
''
*NL*
and
passed
the
intervening
period
in
a
state
of
dotage
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
committed
every
possible
absurdity
,
in
the
way
of
preparation
*NL*
for
this
blessed
event
.
I
turn
hot
when
I
remember
the
cravat
I
bought
.
*NL*
My
boots
might
be
placed
in
any
collection
of
instruments
of
torture
.
I
*NL*
provided
,
and
sent
down
by
the
Norwood
coach
the
night
before
,
a
*NL*
delicate
little
hamper
,
amounting
in
itself
,
I
thought
,
almost
to
a
*NL*
declaration
.
There
were
crackers
in
it
with
the
tenderest
mottos
that
*NL*
could
be
got
for
money
.
At
six
in
the
morning
,
I
was
in
Covent
Garden
*NL*
Market
,
buying
a
bouquet
for
Dora
.
At
ten
I
was
on
horseback
-LRB-
I
hired
a
*NL*
gallant
grey
,
for
the
occasion
-RRB-
,
with
the
bouquet
in
my
hat
,
to
keep
it
*NL*
fresh
,
trotting
down
to
Norwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
that
when
I
saw
Dora
in
the
garden
and
pretended
not
to
see
*NL*
her
,
and
rode
past
the
house
pretending
to
be
anxiously
looking
for
it
,
*NL*
I
committed
two
small
fooleries
which
other
young
gentlemen
in
my
*NL*
circumstances
might
have
committed
--
because
they
came
so
very
natural
to
*NL*
me
.
But
oh
!
when
I
_
did
_
find
the
house
,
and
_
did
_
dismount
at
the
*NL*
garden
gate
,
and
drag
those
stoney-hearted
boots
across
the
lawn
to
Dora
*NL*
sitting
on
a
garden
seat
under
a
lilac
tree
,
what
a
spectacle
she
was
,
*NL*
upon
that
beautiful
morning
,
among
the
butterflies
,
in
a
white
chip
*NL*
bonnet
and
a
dress
of
celestial
blue
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
young
lady
with
her
--
comparatively
stricken
in
years
--
almost
*NL*
twenty
,
I
should
say
.
Her
name
was
Miss
Mills
,
and
Dora
called
her
*NL*
Julia
.
She
was
the
bosom
friend
of
Dora
.
Happy
Miss
Mills
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jip
was
there
,
and
Jip
_
would
_
bark
at
me
again
.
When
I
presented
my
*NL*
bouquet
,
he
gnashed
his
teeth
with
jealousy
.
Well
he
might
.
If
he
had
*NL*
the
least
idea
how
I
adored
his
mistress
,
well
he
might
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Mr.
Copperfield
!
What
dear
flowers
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
had
an
intention
of
saying
-LRB-
and
had
been
studying
the
best
form
of
*NL*
words
for
three
miles
-RRB-
that
I
thought
them
beautiful
before
I
saw
them
*NL*
so
near
_
her
_
.
But
I
could
n't
manage
it
.
She
was
too
bewildering
.
To
see
*NL*
her
lay
the
flowers
against
her
little
dimpled
chin
,
was
to
lose
all
*NL*
presence
of
mind
and
power
of
language
in
a
feeble
ecstacy
.
I
wonder
I
*NL*
did
n't
say
,
``
Kill
me
,
if
you
have
a
heart
,
Miss
Mills
.
Let
me
die
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Dora
held
my
flowers
to
Jip
to
smell
.
Then
Jip
growled
,
and
*NL*
would
n't
smell
them
.
Then
Dora
laughed
,
and
held
them
a
little
closer
to
*NL*
Jip
,
to
make
him
.
Then
Jip
laid
hold
of
a
bit
of
geranium
with
his
*NL*
teeth
,
and
worried
imaginary
cats
in
it
.
Then
Dora
beat
him
,
and
pouted
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
My
poor
beautiful
flowers
!
''
as
compassionately
,
I
thought
,
as
*NL*
if
Jip
had
laid
hold
of
me
.
I
wished
he
had
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
so
glad
to
hear
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
that
that
*NL*
cross
Miss
Murdstone
is
not
here
.
She
has
gone
to
her
brother
's
*NL*
marriage
,
and
will
be
away
at
least
three
weeks
.
Is
n't
that
delightful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
was
sure
it
must
be
delightful
to
her
,
and
all
that
was
*NL*
delightful
to
her
was
delightful
to
me
.
Miss
Mills
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
superior
wisdom
and
benevolence
,
smiled
upon
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
the
most
disagreeable
thing
I
ever
saw
,
''
said
Dora
.
``
You
ca
n't
*NL*
believe
how
ill-tempered
and
shocking
she
is
,
Julia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
,
my
dear
!
''
said
Julia
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
can
,
perhaps
,
love
,
''
returned
Dora
,
with
her
hand
on
Julia
's
.
*NL*
``
Forgive
my
not
excepting
you
,
my
dear
,
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
learnt
,
from
this
,
that
Miss
Mills
had
had
her
trials
in
the
course
of
*NL*
a
chequered
existence
;
and
that
to
these
,
perhaps
,
I
might
refer
that
*NL*
wise
benignity
of
manner
which
I
had
already
noticed
.
I
found
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
day
,
that
this
was
the
case
:
Miss
Mills
having
been
*NL*
unhappy
in
a
misplaced
affection
,
and
being
understood
to
have
retired
*NL*
from
the
world
on
her
awful
stock
of
experience
,
but
still
to
take
a
*NL*
calm
interest
in
the
unblighted
hopes
and
loves
of
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Mr.
Spenlow
came
out
of
the
house
,
and
Dora
went
to
him
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
Look
,
papa
,
what
beautiful
flowers
!
''
And
Miss
Mills
smiled
*NL*
thoughtfully
,
as
who
should
say
,
``
Ye
May-flies
,
enjoy
your
brief
*NL*
existence
in
the
bright
morning
of
life
!
''
And
we
all
walked
from
the
*NL*
lawn
towards
the
carriage
,
which
was
getting
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
never
have
such
a
ride
again
.
I
have
never
had
such
another
.
*NL*
There
were
only
those
three
,
their
hamper
,
my
hamper
,
and
the
*NL*
guitar-case
,
in
the
phaeton
;
and
,
of
course
,
the
phaeton
was
open
;
and
*NL*
I
rode
behind
it
,
and
Dora
sat
with
her
back
to
the
horses
,
looking
*NL*
towards
me
.
She
kept
the
bouquet
close
to
her
on
the
cushion
,
and
*NL*
would
n't
allow
Jip
to
sit
on
that
side
of
her
at
all
,
for
fear
he
*NL*
should
crush
it
.
She
often
carried
it
in
her
hand
,
often
refreshed
*NL*
herself
with
its
fragrance
.
Our
eyes
at
those
times
often
met
;
and
my
*NL*
great
astonishment
is
that
I
did
n't
go
over
the
head
of
my
gallant
grey
*NL*
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
dust
,
I
believe
.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
dust
,
I
believe
.
I
*NL*
have
a
faint
impression
that
Mr.
Spenlow
remonstrated
with
me
for
riding
*NL*
in
it
;
but
I
knew
of
none
.
I
was
sensible
of
a
mist
of
love
and
beauty
*NL*
about
Dora
,
but
of
nothing
else
.
He
stood
up
sometimes
,
and
asked
me
*NL*
what
I
thought
of
the
prospect
.
I
said
it
was
delightful
,
and
I
daresay
*NL*
it
was
;
but
it
was
all
Dora
to
me
.
The
sun
shone
Dora
,
and
the
birds
*NL*
sang
Dora
.
The
south
wind
blew
Dora
,
and
the
wild
flowers
in
the
hedges
*NL*
were
all
Doras
,
to
a
bud
.
My
comfort
is
,
Miss
Mills
understood
me
.
Miss
*NL*
Mills
alone
could
enter
into
my
feelings
thoroughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
long
we
were
going
,
and
to
this
hour
I
know
as
little
*NL*
where
we
went
.
Perhaps
it
was
near
Guildford
.
Perhaps
some
Arabian-night
*NL*
magician
,
opened
up
the
place
for
the
day
,
and
shut
it
for
ever
when
we
*NL*
came
away
.
It
was
a
green
spot
,
on
a
hill
,
carpeted
with
soft
turf
.
*NL*
There
were
shady
trees
,
and
heather
,
and
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
a
*NL*
rich
landscape
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
trying
thing
to
find
people
here
,
waiting
for
us
;
and
my
*NL*
jealousy
,
even
of
the
ladies
,
knew
no
bounds
.
But
all
of
my
own
*NL*
sex
--
especially
one
impostor
,
three
or
four
years
my
elder
,
with
a
*NL*
red
whisker
,
on
which
he
established
an
amount
of
presumption
not
be
*NL*
endured
--
were
my
mortal
foes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
unpacked
our
baskets
,
and
employed
ourselves
in
getting
dinner
*NL*
ready
.
Red
Whisker
pretended
he
could
make
a
salad
-LRB-
which
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
-RRB-
,
and
obtruded
himself
on
public
notice
.
Some
of
the
young
*NL*
ladies
washed
the
lettuces
for
him
,
and
sliced
them
under
his
*NL*
directions
.
Dora
was
among
these
.
I
felt
that
fate
had
pitted
me
against
*NL*
this
man
,
and
one
of
us
must
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Red
Whisker
made
his
salad
-LRB-
I
wondered
how
they
could
eat
it
.
Nothing
*NL*
should
have
induced
_
me
_
to
touch
it
!
-RRB-
and
voted
himself
into
the
charge
*NL*
of
the
wine-cellar
,
which
he
constructed
,
being
an
ingenious
beast
,
in
*NL*
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
.
By-and-by
I
saw
him
,
with
the
majority
of
a
*NL*
lobster
on
his
plate
,
eating
his
dinner
at
the
feet
of
Dora
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
but
an
indistinct
idea
of
what
happened
for
some
time
after
this
*NL*
baleful
object
presented
itself
to
my
view
.
I
was
very
merry
,
I
know
;
*NL*
but
it
was
hollow
merriment
.
I
attached
myself
to
a
young
creature
in
*NL*
pink
,
with
little
eyes
,
and
flirted
with
her
desperately
.
She
received
*NL*
my
attentions
with
favour
;
but
whether
on
my
account
solely
,
or
because
*NL*
she
had
any
designs
on
Red
Whisker
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
Dora
's
health
was
*NL*
drunk
.
When
I
drank
it
,
I
affected
to
interrupt
my
conversation
for
that
*NL*
purpose
,
and
to
resume
it
immediately
afterwards
.
I
caught
Dora
's
eye
as
*NL*
I
bowed
to
her
,
and
I
thought
it
looked
appealing
.
But
it
looked
at
me
*NL*
over
the
head
of
Red
Whisker
,
and
I
was
adamant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
creature
in
pink
had
a
mother
in
green
;
and
I
rather
think
the
*NL*
latter
separated
us
from
motives
of
policy
.
Howbeit
,
there
was
a
general
*NL*
breaking
up
of
the
party
,
while
the
remnants
of
the
dinner
were
being
*NL*
put
away
;
and
I
strolled
off
by
myself
among
the
trees
,
in
a
raging
and
*NL*
remorseful
state
.
I
was
debating
whether
I
should
pretend
that
I
was
not
*NL*
well
,
and
fly
--
I
do
n't
know
where
--
upon
my
gallant
grey
,
when
Dora
and
*NL*
Miss
Mills
met
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Miss
Mills
,
``
you
are
dull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
begged
her
pardon
.
Not
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
Dora
,
''
said
Miss
Mills
,
''
_
you
_
are
dull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
dear
no
!
Not
in
the
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
and
Dora
,
''
said
Miss
Mills
,
with
an
almost
venerable
*NL*
air
.
``
Enough
of
this
.
Do
not
allow
a
trivial
misunderstanding
to
wither
*NL*
the
blossoms
of
spring
,
which
,
once
put
forth
and
blighted
,
can
not
be
*NL*
renewed
.
I
speak
,
''
said
Miss
Mills
,
``
from
experience
of
the
past
--
the
*NL*
remote
irrevocable
past
.
The
gushing
fountains
which
sparkle
in
the
sun
,
*NL*
must
not
be
stopped
in
mere
caprice
;
the
oasis
in
the
desert
of
Sahara
,
*NL*
must
not
be
plucked
up
idly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
knew
what
I
did
,
I
was
burning
all
over
to
that
extraordinary
*NL*
extent
;
but
I
took
Dora
's
little
hand
and
kissed
it
--
and
she
let
me
!
I
*NL*
kissed
Miss
Mills
's
hand
;
and
we
all
seemed
,
to
my
thinking
,
to
go
*NL*
straight
up
to
the
seventh
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
did
not
come
down
again
.
We
stayed
up
there
all
the
evening
.
At
first
*NL*
we
strayed
to
and
fro
among
the
trees
:
I
with
Dora
's
shy
arm
drawn
*NL*
through
mine
:
and
Heaven
knows
,
folly
as
it
all
was
,
it
would
have
been
*NL*
a
happy
fate
to
have
been
struck
immortal
with
those
foolish
feelings
,
*NL*
and
have
strayed
among
the
trees
for
ever
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
much
too
soon
,
we
heard
the
others
laughing
and
talking
,
and
*NL*
calling
``
where
's
Dora
!
''
So
we
went
back
,
and
they
wanted
Dora
to
sing
.
*NL*
Red
Whisker
would
have
got
the
guitar-case
out
of
the
carriage
,
but
Dora
*NL*
told
him
nobody
knew
where
it
was
,
but
I
.
So
Red
Whisker
was
done
for
in
*NL*
a
moment
;
and
_
I
_
got
it
,
and
_
I
_
unlocked
it
,
and
_
I
_
took
the
guitar
*NL*
out
,
and
_
I
_
sat
by
her
,
and
_
I
_
held
her
handkerchief
and
gloves
,
and
*NL*
_
I
_
drank
in
every
note
of
her
dear
voice
,
and
she
sang
to
_
me
_
who
*NL*
loved
her
,
and
all
the
others
might
applaud
as
much
as
they
liked
,
but
*NL*
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
intoxicated
with
joy
.
I
was
afraid
it
was
too
happy
to
be
real
,
*NL*
and
that
I
should
wake
in
Buckingham
Street
presently
,
and
hear
Mrs.
*NL*
Crupp
clinking
the
teacups
in
getting
breakfast
ready
.
But
Dora
sang
,
*NL*
and
others
sang
,
and
Miss
Mills
sang
--
about
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
*NL*
caverns
of
Memory
;
as
if
she
were
a
hundred
years
old
--
and
the
evening
*NL*
came
on
;
and
we
had
tea
,
with
a
kettle
boiling
gipsy-fashion
;
and
I
was
*NL*
still
as
happy
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
happier
than
ever
when
the
party
broke
up
,
and
the
other
people
,
*NL*
defeated
Red
Whisker
and
all
,
went
their
several
ways
,
and
we
went
*NL*
ours
through
the
still
evening
and
the
dying
light
,
with
sweet
scents
*NL*
rising
up
around
us
.
Mr.
Spenlow
being
a
little
drowsy
after
the
*NL*
champagne
--
honour
to
the
soil
that
grew
the
grape
,
to
the
grape
that
*NL*
made
the
wine
,
to
the
sun
that
ripened
it
,
and
to
the
merchant
who
*NL*
adulterated
it
!
--
and
being
fast
asleep
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
I
*NL*
rode
by
the
side
,
and
talked
to
Dora
.
She
admired
my
horse
and
patted
*NL*
him
--
oh
,
what
a
dear
little
hand
it
looked
upon
a
horse
!
--
and
her
shawl
*NL*
would
not
keep
right
,
and
now
and
then
I
drew
it
round
her
with
my
arm
;
*NL*
and
I
even
fancied
that
Jip
began
to
see
how
it
was
,
and
to
understand
*NL*
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
be
friends
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
sagacious
Miss
Mills
,
too
;
that
amiable
,
though
quite
used
up
,
*NL*
recluse
;
that
little
patriarch
of
something
less
than
twenty
,
who
had
*NL*
done
with
the
world
,
and
must
n't
on
any
account
have
the
slumbering
*NL*
echoes
in
the
caverns
of
Memory
awakened
;
what
a
kind
thing
she
did
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Miss
Mills
,
``
come
to
this
side
of
the
carriage
a
*NL*
moment
--
if
you
can
spare
a
moment
.
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Behold
me
,
on
my
gallant
grey
,
bending
at
the
side
of
Miss
Mills
,
with
*NL*
my
hand
upon
the
carriage-door
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dora
is
coming
to
stay
with
me
.
She
is
coming
home
with
me
the
day
*NL*
after
to-morrow
.
If
you
would
like
to
call
,
I
am
sure
papa
would
be
*NL*
happy
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
do
but
invoke
a
silent
blessing
on
Miss
Mills
's
head
,
and
*NL*
store
Miss
Mills
's
address
in
the
securest
corner
of
my
memory
!
What
*NL*
could
I
do
but
tell
Miss
Mills
,
with
grateful
looks
and
fervent
words
,
*NL*
how
much
I
appreciated
her
good
offices
,
and
what
an
inestimable
value
I
*NL*
set
upon
her
friendship
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Miss
Mills
benignantly
dismissed
me
,
saying
,
``
Go
back
to
Dora
!
''
and
*NL*
I
went
;
and
Dora
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
to
talk
to
me
,
and
we
talked
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
the
way
;
and
I
rode
my
gallant
grey
so
close
to
the
*NL*
wheel
that
I
grazed
his
near
fore
leg
against
it
,
and
``
took
the
bark
*NL*
off
,
''
as
his
owner
told
me
,
``
to
the
tune
of
three
pun
'
sivin
''
--
which
I
*NL*
paid
,
and
thought
extremely
cheap
for
so
much
joy
.
What
time
Miss
Mills
*NL*
sat
looking
at
the
moon
,
murmuring
verses
and
recalling
,
I
suppose
,
the
*NL*
ancient
days
when
she
and
earth
had
anything
in
common
.
*NL*
*NL*
Norwood
was
many
miles
too
near
,
and
we
reached
it
many
hours
too
soon
;
*NL*
but
Mr.
Spenlow
came
to
himself
a
little
short
of
it
,
and
said
,
``
You
*NL*
must
come
in
,
Copperfield
,
and
rest
!
''
and
I
consenting
,
we
had
*NL*
sandwiches
and
wine-and-water
.
In
the
light
room
,
Dora
blushing
looked
*NL*
so
lovely
,
that
I
could
not
tear
myself
away
,
but
sat
there
staring
,
in
*NL*
a
dream
,
until
the
snoring
of
Mr.
Spenlow
inspired
me
with
sufficient
*NL*
consciousness
to
take
my
leave
.
So
we
parted
;
I
riding
all
the
way
to
*NL*
London
with
the
farewell
touch
of
Dora
's
hand
still
light
on
mine
,
*NL*
recalling
every
incident
and
word
ten
thousand
times
;
lying
down
in
my
*NL*
own
bed
at
last
,
as
enraptured
a
young
noodle
as
ever
was
carried
out
of
*NL*
his
five
wits
by
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
awoke
next
morning
,
I
was
resolute
to
declare
my
passion
to
Dora
,
*NL*
and
know
my
fate
.
Happiness
or
misery
was
now
the
question
.
There
was
no
*NL*
other
question
that
I
knew
of
in
the
world
,
and
only
Dora
could
give
the
*NL*
answer
to
it
.
I
passed
three
days
in
a
luxury
of
wretchedness
,
torturing
*NL*
myself
by
putting
every
conceivable
variety
of
discouraging
construction
*NL*
on
all
that
ever
had
taken
place
between
Dora
and
me
.
At
last
,
arrayed
*NL*
for
the
purpose
at
a
vast
expense
,
I
went
to
Miss
Mills
's
,
fraught
with
*NL*
a
declaration
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
many
times
I
went
up
and
down
the
street
,
and
round
the
*NL*
square
--
painfully
aware
of
being
a
much
better
answer
to
the
old
riddle
*NL*
than
the
original
one
--
before
I
could
persuade
myself
to
go
up
the
*NL*
steps
and
knock
,
is
no
matter
now
.
Even
when
,
at
last
,
I
had
knocked
,
*NL*
and
was
waiting
at
the
door
,
I
had
some
flurried
thought
of
asking
if
*NL*
that
were
Mr.
Blackboy
's
-LRB-
in
imitation
of
poor
Barkis
-RRB-
,
begging
pardon
,
*NL*
and
retreating
.
But
I
kept
my
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Mills
was
not
at
home
.
I
did
not
expect
he
would
be
.
Nobody
wanted
*NL*
_
him
_
.
Miss
Mills
was
at
home
.
Miss
Mills
would
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
shown
into
a
room
upstairs
,
where
Miss
Mills
and
Dora
were
.
Jip
*NL*
was
there
.
Miss
Mills
was
copying
music
-LRB-
I
recollect
,
it
was
a
new
song
,
*NL*
called
Affection
's
Dirge
-RRB-
,
and
Dora
was
painting
flowers
.
What
were
my
*NL*
feelings
,
when
I
recognised
my
own
flowers
;
the
identical
Covent
Garden
*NL*
Market
purchase
!
I
can
not
say
that
they
were
very
like
,
or
that
they
*NL*
particularly
resembled
any
flowers
that
have
ever
come
under
my
*NL*
observation
;
but
I
knew
from
the
paper
round
them
,
which
was
accurately
*NL*
copied
,
what
the
composition
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mills
was
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
very
sorry
her
Papa
was
not
at
*NL*
home
:
though
I
thought
we
all
bore
that
with
fortitude
.
Miss
Mills
was
*NL*
conversational
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
,
laying
down
her
pen
upon
*NL*
Affection
's
Dirge
,
got
up
,
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
think
I
would
put
it
off
till
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
your
poor
horse
was
not
tired
,
when
he
got
home
at
night
,
''
said
*NL*
Dora
,
lifting
up
her
beautiful
eyes
.
``
It
was
a
long
way
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
think
I
would
do
it
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
long
way
for
_
him
_
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
_
he
_
had
nothing
to
uphold
*NL*
him
on
the
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
he
fed
,
poor
thing
?
''
asked
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
think
I
would
put
it
off
till
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
--
yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
he
was
well
taken
care
of
.
I
mean
he
had
not
the
*NL*
unutterable
happiness
that
I
had
in
being
so
near
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
bent
her
head
over
her
drawing
,
and
said
,
after
a
little
while
--
I
*NL*
had
sat
,
in
the
interval
,
in
a
burning
fever
,
and
with
my
legs
in
a
very
*NL*
rigid
state
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
seem
to
be
sensible
of
that
happiness
yourself
,
at
one
time
*NL*
of
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
now
that
I
was
in
for
it
,
and
it
must
be
done
on
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
care
for
that
happiness
in
the
least
,
''
said
Dora
,
slightly
*NL*
raising
her
eyebrows
,
and
shaking
her
head
,
``
when
you
were
sitting
by
*NL*
Miss
Kitt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitt
,
I
should
observe
,
was
the
name
of
the
creature
in
pink
,
with
the
*NL*
little
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
certainly
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
or
why
you
*NL*
should
call
it
a
happiness
at
all
.
But
of
course
you
do
n't
mean
what
you
*NL*
say
.
And
I
am
sure
no
one
doubts
your
being
at
liberty
to
do
what-ever
*NL*
you
like
.
Jip
,
you
naughty
boy
,
come
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
I
did
it
.
I
did
it
in
a
moment
.
I
intercepted
Jip
.
I
*NL*
had
Dora
in
my
arms
.
I
was
full
of
eloquence
.
I
never
stopped
for
a
*NL*
word
.
I
told
her
how
I
loved
her
.
I
told
her
I
should
die
without
her
.
I
*NL*
told
her
that
I
idolised
and
worshipped
her
.
Jip
barked
madly
all
the
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dora
hung
her
head
and
cried
,
and
trembled
,
my
eloquence
increased
*NL*
so
much
the
more
.
If
she
would
like
me
to
die
for
her
,
she
had
but
to
*NL*
say
the
word
,
and
I
was
ready
.
Life
without
Dora
's
love
was
not
a
thing
*NL*
to
have
on
any
terms
.
I
could
n't
bear
it
,
and
I
would
n't
.
I
had
loved
*NL*
her
every
minute
,
day
and
night
,
since
I
first
saw
her
.
I
loved
her
at
*NL*
that
minute
to
distraction
.
I
should
always
love
her
,
every
minute
,
to
*NL*
distraction
.
Lovers
had
loved
before
,
and
lovers
would
love
again
;
but
*NL*
no
lover
had
ever
loved
,
might
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
ever
love
,
as
I
*NL*
loved
Dora
.
The
more
I
raved
,
the
more
Jip
barked
.
Each
of
us
,
in
his
*NL*
own
way
,
got
more
mad
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
well
!
Dora
and
I
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
by-and-by
,
quiet
enough
,
*NL*
and
Jip
was
lying
in
her
lap
,
winking
peacefully
at
me
.
It
was
off
my
*NL*
mind
.
I
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
rapture
.
Dora
and
I
were
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
we
had
some
notion
that
this
was
to
end
in
marriage
.
We
must
*NL*
have
had
some
,
because
Dora
stipulated
that
we
were
never
to
be
married
*NL*
without
her
papa
's
consent
.
But
,
in
our
youthful
ecstacy
,
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
that
we
really
looked
before
us
or
behind
us
;
or
had
any
aspiration
*NL*
beyond
the
ignorant
present
.
We
were
to
keep
our
secret
from
Mr.
*NL*
Spenlow
;
but
I
am
sure
the
idea
never
entered
my
head
,
then
,
that
there
*NL*
was
anything
dishonorable
in
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mills
was
more
than
usually
pensive
when
Dora
,
going
to
find
her
,
*NL*
brought
her
back
;
--
I
apprehend
,
because
there
was
a
tendency
in
what
had
*NL*
passed
to
awaken
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
caverns
of
memory
.
But
she
*NL*
gave
us
her
blessing
,
and
the
assurance
of
her
lasting
friendship
,
and
*NL*
spoke
to
us
,
generally
,
as
became
a
Voice
from
the
Cloister
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
an
idle
time
it
was
!
What
an
unsubstantial
,
happy
,
foolish
time
it
*NL*
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
measured
Dora
's
finger
for
a
ring
that
was
to
be
made
of
*NL*
Forget-me-nots
,
and
when
the
jeweller
,
to
whom
I
took
the
measure
,
*NL*
found
me
out
,
and
laughed
over
his
order
book
,
and
charged
me
anything
*NL*
he
liked
,
for
the
pretty
little
toy
,
with
its
blue
stones
--
so
*NL*
associated
in
my
remembrance
with
Dora
's
hand
,
that
yesterday
,
when
I
*NL*
saw
such
another
,
by
chance
,
on
the
finger
of
my
own
daughter
,
there
*NL*
was
a
momentary
stirring
in
my
heart
,
like
pain
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
walked
about
,
exalted
with
my
secret
,
and
full
of
my
own
*NL*
interest
,
and
felt
the
dignity
of
loving
Dora
,
and
of
being
beloved
,
so
*NL*
much
,
that
if
I
had
walked
the
air
,
I
could
not
have
been
more
above
the
*NL*
people
not
so
situated
,
who
were
creeping
on
the
earth
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
those
meetings
in
the
garden
of
the
square
,
and
sat
within
*NL*
the
dingy
summer-house
,
so
happy
,
that
I
love
the
London
sparrows
to
*NL*
this
hour
,
for
nothing
else
,
and
see
the
plumage
of
the
tropics
in
their
*NL*
smoky
feathers
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
our
first
great
quarrel
-LRB-
within
a
week
of
our
betrothal
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
when
Dora
sent
me
back
the
ring
,
enclosed
in
a
despairing
cocked-hat
*NL*
note
,
wherein
she
used
the
terrible
expression
that
``
our
love
had
begun
*NL*
in
folly
,
and
ended
in
madness
!
''
which
dreadful
words
occasioned
me
to
*NL*
tear
my
hair
,
and
cry
that
all
was
over
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
under
cover
of
the
night
,
I
flew
to
Miss
Mills
,
whom
I
saw
by
*NL*
stealth
in
a
back
kitchen
where
there
was
a
mangle
,
and
implored
Miss
*NL*
Mills
to
interpose
between
us
and
avert
insanity
.
When
Miss
Mills
*NL*
undertook
the
office
and
returned
with
Dora
,
exhorting
us
,
from
the
*NL*
pulpit
of
her
own
bitter
youth
,
to
mutual
concession
,
and
the
avoidance
*NL*
of
the
Desert
of
Sahara
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
cried
,
and
made
it
up
,
and
were
so
blest
again
,
that

all

changed
to
Love
's

where
*NL*
we
arranged
a
plan
of
correspondence
through
Miss
Mills
,
always
to
*NL*
comprehend
at
least
one
letter
on
each
side
every
day
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
an
idle
time
!
What
an
unsubstantial
,
happy
,
foolish
time
!
Of
all
*NL*
the
times
of
mine
that
Time
has
in
his
grip
,
there
is
none
that
in
one
*NL*
retrospection
I
can
smile
at
half
so
much

and
think
of
half
so

tenderly

CHAPTER
XXXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
MY
AUNT
ASTONISHES
ME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrote
to
Agnes
as
soon
as
Dora
and
I
were
engaged
.
I
wrote
her
a
long
*NL*
letter
,
in
which
I
tried
to
make
her
comprehend
how
blest
I
was
,
and
*NL*
what
a
darling
Dora
was
.
I
entreated
Agnes
not
to
regard
this
as
a
*NL*
thoughtless
passion
which
could
ever
yield
to
any
other
,
or
had
the
*NL*
least
resemblance
to
the
boyish
fancies
that
we
used
to
joke
about
.
I
*NL*
assured
her
that
its
profundity
was
quite
unfathomable
,
and
expressed
my
*NL*
belief
that
nothing
like
it
had
ever
been
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
,
as
I
wrote
to
Agnes
on
a
fine
evening
by
my
open
window
,
and
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
her
clear
calm
eyes
and
gentle
face
came
stealing
*NL*
over
me
,
it
shed
such
a
peaceful
influence
upon
the
hurry
and
agitation
*NL*
in
which
I
had
been
living
lately
,
and
of
which
my
very
happiness
*NL*
partook
in
some
degree
,
that
it
soothed
me
into
tears
.
I
remember
that
I
*NL*
sat
resting
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
when
the
letter
was
half
done
,
*NL*
cherishing
a
general
fancy
as
if
Agnes
were
one
of
the
elements
of
my
*NL*
natural
home
.
As
if
,
in
the
retirement
of
the
house
made
almost
sacred
*NL*
to
me
by
her
presence
,
Dora
and
I
must
be
happier
than
anywhere
.
As
if
,
*NL*
in
love
,
joy
,
sorrow
,
hope
,
or
disappointment
;
in
all
emotions
;
my
heart
*NL*
turned
naturally
there
,
and
found
its
refuge
and
best
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Steerforth
,
I
said
nothing
.
I
only
told
her
there
had
been
sad
grief
*NL*
at
Yarmouth
,
on
account
of
Emily
's
flight
;
and
that
on
me
it
made
a
*NL*
double
wound
,
by
reason
of
the
circumstances
attending
it
.
I
knew
how
*NL*
quick
she
always
was
to
divine
the
truth
,
and
that
she
would
never
be
*NL*
the
first
to
breathe
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
letter
,
I
received
an
answer
by
return
of
post
.
As
I
read
it
,
I
*NL*
seemed
to
hear
Agnes
speaking
to
me
.
It
was
like
her
cordial
voice
in
my
*NL*
ears
.
What
can
I
say
more
!
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
had
been
away
from
home
lately
,
Traddles
had
called
twice
or
*NL*
thrice
.
Finding
Peggotty
within
,
and
being
informed
by
Peggotty
-LRB-
who
*NL*
always
volunteered
that
information
to
whomsoever
would
receive
it
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
she
was
my
old
nurse
,
he
had
established
a
good-humoured
*NL*
acquaintance
with
her
,
and
had
stayed
to
have
a
little
chat
with
her
*NL*
about
me
.
So
Peggotty
said
;
but
I
am
afraid
the
chat
was
all
on
her
own
*NL*
side
,
and
of
immoderate
length
,
as
she
was
very
difficult
indeed
to
*NL*
stop
,
God
bless
her
!
when
she
had
me
for
her
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
reminds
me
,
not
only
that
I
expected
Traddles
on
a
certain
*NL*
afternoon
of
his
own
appointing
,
which
was
now
come
,
but
that
Mrs.
Crupp
*NL*
had
resigned
everything
appertaining
to
her
office
-LRB-
the
salary
excepted
-RRB-
*NL*
until
Peggotty
should
cease
to
present
herself
.
Mrs.
Crupp
,
after
*NL*
holding
divers
conversations
respecting
Peggotty
,
in
a
very
high
pitched
*NL*
voice
,
on
the
staircase
--
with
some
invisible
Familiar
it
would
appear
,
*NL*
for
corporeally
speaking
she
was
quite
alone
at
those
times
--
addressed
a
*NL*
letter
to
me
,
developing
her
views
.
Beginning
it
with
that
statement
of
*NL*
universal
application
,
which
fitted
every
occurrence
of
her
life
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
she
was
a
mother
herself
,
she
went
on
to
inform
me
that
she
*NL*
had
once
seen
very
different
days
,
but
that
at
all
periods
of
her
*NL*
existence
she
had
had
a
constitutional
objection
to
spies
,
intruders
,
*NL*
and
informers
.
She
named
no
names
,
she
said
;
let
them
the
cap
fitted
,
*NL*
wear
it
;
but
spies
,
intruders
,
and
informers
,
especially
in
widders
'
*NL*
weeds
-LRB-
this
clause
was
underlined
-RRB-
,
she
had
ever
accustomed
herself
to
*NL*
look
down
upon
.
If
a
gentleman
was
the
victim
of
spies
,
intruders
,
and
*NL*
informers
-LRB-
but
still
naming
no
names
-RRB-
,
that
was
his
own
pleasure
.
He
had
*NL*
a
right
to
please
himself
;
so
let
him
do
.
All
that
she
,
Mrs.
Crupp
,
*NL*
stipulated
for
,
was
,
that
she
should
not
be
``
brought
in
contract
''
with
*NL*
such
persons
.
Therefore
she
begged
to
be
excused
from
any
further
*NL*
attendance
on
the
top
set
,
until
things
was
as
they
formerly
was
,
and
as
*NL*
they
could
be
wished
to
be
;
and
further
mentioned
that
her
little
book
*NL*
would
be
found
upon
the
breakfast-table
every
Saturday
morning
,
when
she
*NL*
requested
an
immediate
settlement
of
the
same
,
with
the
benevolent
view
*NL*
of
saving
trouble
,
``
and
an
ill-conwenience
''
to
all
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
Mrs.
Crupp
confined
herself
to
making
pitfalls
on
the
*NL*
stairs
,
principally
with
pitchers
,
and
endeavouring
to
delude
Peggotty
*NL*
into
breaking
her
legs
.
I
found
it
rather
harassing
to
live
in
this
*NL*
state
of
siege
,
but
was
too
much
afraid
of
Mrs.
Crupp
to
see
any
way
out
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
cried
Traddles
,
punctually
appearing
at
my
door
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
all
these
obstacles
,
``
how
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Traddles
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
at
last
,
and
very
*NL*
sorry
I
have
not
been
at
home
before
.
But
I
have
been
so
much
*NL*
engaged
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
of
course
.
Yours
lives
in
London
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
--
excuse
me
--
Miss
D.
,
you
know

said
Traddles
,
colouring
in
his
*NL*
great
delicacy
,
``
lives
in
London
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
Near
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
perhaps
you
recollect
,
''
said
Traddles
,
with
a
serious
look
,
*NL*
``
lives
down
in
Devonshire
--
one
of
ten
.
Consequently
,
I
am
not
so
much
*NL*
engaged
as
you
--
in
that
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
can
bear
,
''
I
returned
,
``
to
see
her
so
seldom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
!
''
said
Traddles
,
thoughtfully
.
``
It
does
seem
a
wonder
.
I
suppose
it
*NL*
is
,
Copperfield
,
because
there
's
no
help
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
I
replied
,
with
a
smile
,
and
not
without
a
blush
.
``
And
*NL*
because
you
have
so
much
constancy
and
patience
,
Traddles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Traddles
,
considering
about
it
,
``
do
I
strike
you
in
that
*NL*
way
,
Copperfield
?
Really
I
did
n't
know
that
I
had

But
she
is
such
an
*NL*
extraordinarily
dear
girl
herself
,
that
it
's
possible
she
may
have
*NL*
imparted
something
of
those
virtues
to
me
.
Now
you
mention
it
,
*NL*
Copperfield
,
I
should
n't
wonder
at
all
.
I
assure
you
she
is
always
*NL*
forgetting
herself
,
and
taking
care
of
the
other
nine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
the
eldest
?

I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no

said
Traddles
.
``
The
eldest
is
a
Beauty

*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
,
I
suppose
,
that
I
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
simplicity
of
*NL*
this
reply
;
and
added
,
with
a
smile
upon
his
own
ingenuous
face
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
,
of
course
,
but
that
my
Sophy

pretty
name

always

think

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pretty

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

of
course

be
one

the
dearest

*NL*

seemed
to
be
describing
clouds
about
himself

with
both
hands
:

``
Splendid

said
Traddles
,
energetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
assure
you

said
Traddles
,
``
something
very
uncommon

indeed

Then

you
know

being
formed
for
society
and
admiration

not
being
*NL*
able
to
enjoy
much
of
it
,
in
consequence
of
their
limited
means
,
she
*NL*
naturally
gets
a
little
irritable
and
exacting
,
sometimes

Sophy
puts
*NL*
her
in
good
humour

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Sophy
the
youngest
?

I
hazarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear

no
!

said
Traddles
,
stroking
his
chin
.
``
The
two
youngest

only
nine

ten

Sophy
educates

The

I
hazarded

``
No

Traddles

``
Sarah

the

something

The

will
wear
out
by-and-by

the

doctors

in

Traddles

indeed

Traddles

in

merely
domestic
view

it
is
not

bad

it
might
be

her
place

She
is

quite
as
much
a

her
mother

she
is

*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
greatest
admiration
for
the
virtues
of
this
young
lady

*NL*
honestly
with
the
view
of
doing
my
best
to
prevent
the
good-nature
of
*NL*
Traddles
from
being
imposed
upon
,
to
the
detriment
of
their
joint
*NL*
prospects
in
life

inquired
how
Mr.
Micawber
was
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
quite
well

Copperfield

you

said
Traddles

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

You
see
the
truth
is
,

said
Traddles
,
in
a
whisper
,
``
he
has
changed
*NL*
his
name
to
Mortimer

in
consequence
of
his
temporary
embarrassments

*NL*
and
he

n't
come
out
till
after
dark
--
and
then
in
spectacles

There
was
*NL*
an
execution
put
into
our
house
,
for
rent
.
Mrs.
Micawber
was
in
such
a
*NL*
dreadful
state
that
I
really
could
n't
resist
giving
my
name
to
that
*NL*
second
bill
we
spoke
of
here
.
You
may
imagine
how
delightful
it
was
to
*NL*
my
feelings
,
Copperfield
,
to
see
the
matter
settled
with
it
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
recover
her
spirits

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum

said
I.

Not

Traddles

unfortunately

within
a

another

It
broke
up

I
have
been
living
in

furnished
apartment
since
then

the
Mortimers
have
been
very
private
indeed

I
hope
you
wo
n't
think
*NL*
it
selfish

Copperfield
,
if
I
mention
that
the

carried
off
my

little
round
table
with
the
marble
top

Sophy
's
flower-pot
and
*NL*
stand
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
hard
thing

I
exclaimed
indignantly

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a

it
was
a
pull

said
Traddles

with
his
usual
wince
at
that

expression

``
I
do
n't
mention
it
reproachfully

however

with
a

motive

The
fact
is

Copperfield
,
I
was
unable
to
repurchase
them
at
the
*NL*
time
of
their
seizure
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
the
broker
,
having
an
*NL*
idea
that
I
wanted
them
,
ran
the
price
up
to
an
extravagant
extent
;
and
,
*NL*
in
the
second
place
,
because
I
--
had
n't
any
money
.
Now
,
I
have
kept
my
*NL*
eye
since
,
upon
the
broker
's
shop

said
Traddles
,
with
a
great
*NL*
enjoyment
of
his
mystery
,
``
which
is
up
at
the
top
of
Tottenham
Court
*NL*
Road

and

at
last

to-day
I
find
them
put
out
for
sale

I
have
only
*NL*
noticed
them
from
over
the
way

if
the
broker
saw

you

he

ask
any

for
them

has
occurred
to
me
,
having
now
*NL*
the
money
,
is
,
that
perhaps
you
would
n't
object
to
ask
that
good
nurse
*NL*
of
yours
to
come
with
me
to
the
shop
--
I
can
show
it
her
from
round
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
next
street
--
and
make
the
best
bargain
for
them
,
as
if
*NL*
they
were
for
herself
,
that
she
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
delight
with
which
Traddles
propounded
this
plan
to
me
,
and
the
*NL*
sense
he
had
of
its
uncommon
artfulness
,
are
among
the
freshest
things
*NL*
in
my
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
that
my
old
nurse
would
be
delighted
to
assist
him
,
and
that
*NL*
we
would
all
three
take
the
field
together
,
but
on
one
condition
.
That
*NL*
condition
was
,
that
he
should
make
a
solemn
resolution
to
grant
no
more
*NL*
loans
of
his
name
,
or
anything
else
,
to
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
I
have
already
done
so
,
because
I
*NL*
begin
to
feel
that
I
have
not
only
been
inconsiderate
,
but
that
I
have
*NL*
been
positively
unjust
to
Sophy
.
My
word
being
passed
to
myself
,
there
*NL*
is
no
longer
any
apprehension
;
but
I
pledge
it
to
you
,
too
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
readiness
.
That
first
unlucky
obligation
,
I
have
paid
.
I
have
*NL*
no
doubt
Mr.
Micawber
would
have
paid
it
if
he
could
,
but
he
could
not
.
*NL*
One
thing
I
ought
to
mention
,
which
I
like
very
much
in
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
Copperfield
.
It
refers
to
the
second
obligation
,
which
is
not
yet
due
.
*NL*
He
do
n't
tell
me
that
it
_
is
_
provided
for
,
but
he
says
it
_
will
be
_
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
think
there
is
something
very
fair
and
honest
about
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
unwilling
to
damp
my
good
friend
's
confidence
,
and
therefore
*NL*
assented
.
After
a
little
further
conversation
,
we
went
round
to
the
*NL*
chandler
's
shop
,
to
enlist
Peggotty
;
Traddles
declining
to
pass
the
*NL*
evening
with
me
,
both
because
he
endured
the
liveliest
apprehensions
*NL*
that
his
property
would
be
bought
by
somebody
else
before
he
could
*NL*
re-purchase
it
,
and
because
it
was
the
evening
he
always
devoted
to
*NL*
writing
to
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
shall
forget
him
peeping
round
the
corner
of
the
street
in
*NL*
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
while
Peggotty
was
bargaining
for
the
precious
*NL*
articles
;
or
his
agitation
when
she
came
slowly
towards
us
after
vainly
*NL*
offering
a
price
,
and
was
hailed
by
the
relenting
broker
,
and
went
back
*NL*
again
.
The
end
of
the
negotiation
was
,
that
she
bought
the
property
on
*NL*
tolerably
easy
terms
,
and
Traddles
was
transported
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
indeed
,
''
said
Traddles
,
on
hearing
it
*NL*
was
to
be
sent
to
where
he
lived
,
that
night
.
``
If
I
might
ask
one
other
*NL*
favor
,
I
hope
you
would
n't
think
it
absurd
,
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
beforehand
,
certainly
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
you
_
would
_
be
good
enough
,
''
said
Traddles
to
Peggotty
,
``
to
*NL*
get
the
flower-pot
now
,
I
think
I
should
like
-LRB-
it
being
Sophy
's
,
*NL*
Copperfield
-RRB-
to
carry
it
home
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
was
glad
to
get
it
for
him
,
and
he
overwhelmed
her
with
thanks
,
*NL*
and
went
his
way
up
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
carrying
the
flower-pot
*NL*
affectionately
in
his
arms
,
with
one
of
the
most
delighted
expressions
*NL*
of
countenance
I
ever
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
then
turned
back
towards
my
chambers
.
As
the
shops
had
charms
for
*NL*
Peggotty
which
I
never
knew
them
possess
in
the
same
degree
for
anybody
*NL*
else
,
I
sauntered
easily
along
,
amused
by
her
staring
in
at
the
windows
,
*NL*
and
waiting
for
her
as
often
as
she
chose
.
We
were
thus
a
good
while
in
*NL*
getting
to
the
Adelphi
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
way
upstairs
,
I
called
her
attention
to
the
sudden
disappearance
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Crupp
's
pitfalls
,
and
also
to
the
prints
of
recent
footsteps
.
We
*NL*
were
both
very
much
surprised
,
coming
higher
up
,
to
find
my
outer
door
*NL*
standing
open
-LRB-
which
I
had
shut
-RRB-
,
and
to
hear
voices
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
at
one
another
,
without
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
,
and
went
*NL*
into
the
sitting-room
.
What
was
my
amazement
to
find
,
of
all
people
upon
*NL*
earth
,
my
aunt
there
,
and
Mr.
Dick
!
My
aunt
sitting
on
a
quantity
of
*NL*
luggage
,
with
her
two
birds
before
her
,
and
her
cat
on
her
knee
,
like
a
*NL*
female
Robinson
Crusoe
,
drinking
tea
.
Mr.
Dick
leaning
thoughtfully
on
a
*NL*
great
kite
,
such
as
we
had
often
been
out
together
to
fly
,
with
more
*NL*
luggage
piled
about
him

I.
``
Why

what
an
unexpected
pleasure

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
cordially
embraced
;
and
Mr.
Dick
and
I
cordially
shook
hands
;
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
,
who
was
busy
making
tea
,
and
could
not
be
too
attentive
,
*NL*
cordially
said
she
had
knowed
well
as
Mr.
Copperfull
would
have
his
*NL*
heart
in
his
mouth
,
when
he
see
his
dear
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa

said
my
aunt
to
Peggotty
,
who
quailed
before
her
awful
*NL*
presence
.
``
How
are
_
you
_
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember

I.

*NL*
``
For

exclaimed
my

,
``
do
n't
call

If

*NL*
which
was
the
best
thing
she
could
do

why
do

you
give
her
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
change

What

your

said
my
aunt
,
as
a
*NL*
compromise
for
the
obnoxious
appellation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barkis

said
Peggotty
,
with
a
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

human

said
my

``
It

How
d'
ye

hope
you
're
well

*NL*
*NL*
Encouraged
by
these
gracious
words
,
and
by
my
aunt
's
extending
her
hand
,
*NL*
Barkis
came
forward
,
and
took
the
hand
,
and
curtseyed
her
*NL*
acknowledgments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
older
than
we
were

said
my

``
We

*NL*
my

*NL*
*NL*
I
handed
it
dutifully
to
my
aunt
,
who
was
in
her
usual
inflexible
state
*NL*
of
figure
;
and
ventured
a
remonstrance
with
her
on
the
subject
of
her
*NL*
sitting
on
a
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

draw

*NL*
``

replied
my

``

Here
my

looked
hard
at
Mrs.

observed
,
``

*NL*
``
Shall

*NL*
``

my

my

``

well

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
,
who
had
been
incessantly
smiling
to
express
sweet
temper
,
*NL*
and
incessantly
holding
her
head
on
one
side
,
to
express
a
general
*NL*
feebleness
of
constitution
,
and
incessantly
rubbing
her
hands
,
to
*NL*
express
a
desire
to
be
of
service
to
all
deserving
objects
,
gradually
*NL*
smiled
herself
,
one-sided
herself
,
and
rubbed
herself
,
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick

said
my
aunt

``
You
know
what
I
told

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
--
with
rather
a
scared
look
,
as
if
he
had
forgotten
it
--
returned
*NL*
a
hasty
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Crupp
is
one
of
them

said
my
aunt
.
``

,
I
'll
trouble
you
to
*NL*
look
after
the
tea
,
and
let
me
have
another
cup

for
I
do
n't
fancy
that
*NL*
woman
's
pouring-out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
my
aunt
sufficiently
well
to
know
that
she
had
something
of
*NL*
importance
on
her
mind
,
and
that
there
was
far
more
matter
in
this
*NL*
arrival
than
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
.
I
noticed
how
her
eye
*NL*
lighted
on
me
,
when
she
thought
my
attention
otherwise
occupied
;
and
*NL*
what
a
curious
process
of
hesitation
appeared
to
be
going
on
within
her
,
*NL*
while
she
preserved
her
outward
stiffness
and
composure
.
I
began
to
*NL*
reflect
whether
I
had
done
anything
to
offend
her
;
and
my
conscience
*NL*
whispered
me
that
I
had
not
yet
told
her
about
Dora
.
Could
it
by
any
*NL*
means
be
that
,
I
wondered
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
knew
she
would
only
speak
in
her
own
good
time
,
I
sat
down
near
*NL*
her
,
and
spoke
to
the
birds
,
and
played
with
the
cat
,
and
was
as
easy
as
*NL*
I
could
be
.
But
I
was
very
far
from
being
really
easy
;
and
I
should
*NL*
still
have
been
so
,
even
if
Mr.
Dick
,
leaning
over
the
great
kite
behind
*NL*
my
aunt
,
had
not
taken
every
secret
opportunity
of
shaking
his
head
*NL*
darkly
at
me
,
and
pointing
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
at
last
,
when
she
had
finished
her
tea
,
and
*NL*
carefully
smoothed
down
her
dress
,
and
wiped
her
lips
--
``
you
need
n't
go
,
*NL*
Barkis

have
you
got
to
be
firm

self-reliant
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you

inquired
Miss
Betsey

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why

my

said
my
aunt
,
looking
earnestly
at
me
,
``
why
do
you
*NL*
think
I
prefer
to
sit
upon
this
property
of
mine
to-night

*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
,
unable
to
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
it
's
all
I
have

Because
I
'm
ruined

my
dear

*NL*
*NL*
If
the
house
,
and
every
one
of
us
,
had
tumbled
out
into
the
river
*NL*
together
,
I
could
hardly
have
received
a
greater
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick
knows
it
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
laying
her
hand
calmly
on
my
shoulder
.
``
I
*NL*
am
ruined

my

All
I

the
cottage

left

I
want

up
something

We
'll
talk
about
this

more

to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
roused
from
my
amazement
,
and
concern
for
her
--
I
am
sure
,
for
*NL*
her
--
by
her
falling
on
my
neck
,
for
a
moment
,
and
crying
that
she
only
*NL*
grieved
for
me
.
In
another
moment
,
she
suppressed
this
emotion
;
and
*NL*
said
with
an
aspect
more
triumphant
than
dejected
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
meet
reverses
boldly

not
suffer
them
to
frighten
us

We
must
learn
to
act
the
play
out

We
must
live
misfortune
down

CHAPTER
XXXV
.
*NL*
*NL*
DEPRESSION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
could
recover
my
presence
of
mind
,
which
quite
deserted
me
*NL*
in
the
first
overpowering
shock
of
my
aunt
's
intelligence
,
I
proposed
to
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
to
come
round
to
the
chandler
's
shop
,
and
take
possession
of
*NL*
the
bed
which
Mr.
Peggotty
had
lately
vacated
.
The
chandler
's
shop
being
*NL*
in
Hungerford
Market
,
and
Hungerford
Market
being
a
very
different
place
*NL*
in
those
days
,
there
was
a
low
wooden
colonnade
before
the
door
-LRB-
not
*NL*
very
unlike
that
before
the
house
where
the
little
man
and
woman
used
to
*NL*
live
,
in
the
old
weather-glass
-RRB-
,
which
pleased
Mr.
Dick
mightily
.
The
*NL*
glory
of
lodging
over
this
structure
would
have
compensated
him
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
for
many
inconveniences
;
but
,
as
there
were
really
few
to
bear
,
*NL*
beyond
the
compound
of
flavors
I
have
already
mentioned
,
and
perhaps
the
*NL*
want
of
a
little
more
elbow-room
,
he
was
perfectly
charmed
with
his
*NL*
accommodation
.
Mrs.
Crupp
had
indignantly
assured
him
that
there
was
n't
*NL*
room
to
swing
a
cat
there
;
but
,
as
Mr.
Dick
justly
observed
to
me
,
*NL*
sitting
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
nursing
his
leg
,
``
You
know
,
*NL*
Trotwood
,
I
do
n't
want
to
swing
a
cat
.
I
never
do
swing
a
cat
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
what
does
that
signify
to
_
me
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
ascertain
whether
Mr.
Dick
had
any
understanding
of
the
*NL*
causes
of
this
sudden
and
great
change
in
my
aunt
's
affairs
.
As
I
might
*NL*
have
expected
,
he
had
none
at
all
.
The
only
account
he
could
give
of
it
,
*NL*
was
,
that
my
aunt
had
said
to
him
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
``
Now
,
Dick
,
*NL*
are
you
really
and
truly
the
philosopher
I
take
you
for
?
''
That
then
he
*NL*
had
said
,
Yes
,
he
hoped
so
.
That
then
my
aunt
had
said
,
``
Dick
,
I
am
*NL*
ruined
.
''
That
then
he
had
said
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
That
then
my
aunt
had
*NL*
praised
him
highly
,
which
he
was
very
glad
of
.
And
that
then
they
had
*NL*
come
to
me
,
and
had
had
bottled
porter
and
sandwiches
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
was
so
very
complacent
,
sitting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
nursing
*NL*
his
leg
,
and
telling
me
this
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
and
a
surprised
*NL*
smile
,
that
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
was
provoked
into
explaining
to
him
that
*NL*
ruin
meant
distress
,
want
,
and
starvation
;
but
,
I
was
soon
bitterly
*NL*
reproved
for
this
harshness
,
by
seeing
his
face
turn
pale
,
and
tears
*NL*
course
down
his
lengthened
cheeks
,
while
he
fixed
upon
me
a
look
of
such
*NL*
unutterable
woe
,
that
it
might
have
softened
a
far
harder
heart
than
*NL*
mine
.
I
took
infinitely
greater
pains
to
cheer
him
up
again
than
I
had
*NL*
taken
to
depress
him
;
and
I
soon
understood
-LRB-
as
I
ought
to
have
known
at
*NL*
first
-RRB-
that
he
had
been
so
confident
,
merely
because
of
his
faith
in
the
*NL*
wisest
and
most
wonderful
of
women
,
and
his
unbounded
reliance
on
my
*NL*
intellectual
resources
.
The
latter
,
I
believe
,
he
considered
a
match
for
*NL*
any
kind
of
disaster
not
absolutely
mortal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
we
do
,
Trotwood
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
There
's
the
Memorial
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
there
is
,
''
said
I.
``
But
all
we
can
do
just
now
,
Mr.
Dick
,
is
*NL*
to
keep
a
cheerful
countenance
,
and
not
let
my
aunt
see
that
we
are
*NL*
thinking
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
assented
to
this
in
the
most
earnest
manner
;
and
implored
me
,
if
I
*NL*
should
see
him
wandering
an
inch
out
of
the
right
course
,
to
recal
him
*NL*
by
some
of
those
superior
methods
which
were
always
at
my
command
.
But
I
*NL*
regret
to
state
that
the
fright
I
had
given
him
proved
too
much
for
his
*NL*
best
attempts
at
concealment
.
All
the
evening
his
eyes
wandered
to
my
*NL*
aunt
's
face
,
with
an
expression
of
the
most
dismal
apprehension
,
as
if
*NL*
he
saw
her
growing
thin
on
the
spot
.
He
was
conscious
of
this
,
and
put
a
*NL*
constraint
upon
his
head
;
but
his
keeping
that
immovable
,
and
sitting
*NL*
rolling
his
eyes
like
a
piece
of
machinery
,
did
not
mend
the
matter
at
*NL*
all
.
I
saw
him
look
at
the
loaf
at
supper
-LRB-
which
happened
to
be
a
small
*NL*
one
-RRB-
,
as
if
nothing
else
stood
between
us
and
famine
;
and
when
my
aunt
*NL*
insisted
on
his
making
his
customary
repast
,
I
detected
him
in
the
act
*NL*
of
pocketing
fragments
of
his
bread
and
cheese
;
I
have
no
doubt
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
reviving
us
with
those
savings
,
when
we
should
have
reached
*NL*
an
advanced
stage
of
attenuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
in
a
composed
frame
of
mind
,
which
was
a
*NL*
lesson
to
all
of
us
--
to
me
,
I
am
sure
.
She
was
extremely
gracious
to
*NL*
Peggotty
,
except
when
I
inadvertently
called
her
by
that
name
;
and
,
*NL*
strange
as
I
knew
she
felt
in
London
,
appeared
quite
at
home
.
She
was
to
*NL*
have
my
bed
,
and
I
was
to
lie
in
the
sitting-room
,
to
keep
guard
over
*NL*
her
.
She
made
a
great
point
of
being
so
near
the
river
,
in
case
of
a
*NL*
conflagration
;
and
I
suppose
really
did
find
some
satisfaction
in
that
*NL*
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
my
dear
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
when
she
saw
me
making
preparations
for
*NL*
compounding
her
usual
night-draught
,
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
wine
,
my
dear
.
Ale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
wine
here
,
aunt
.
And
you
always
have
it
made
of
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
that
,
in
case
of
sickness
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
We
must
n't
use
it
*NL*
carelessly
,
Trot
.
Ale
for
me
.
Half
a
pint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Mr.
Dick
would
have
fallen
,
insensible
.
My
aunt
being
*NL*
resolute
,
I
went
out
and
got
the
ale
myself
.
As
it
was
growing
late
,
*NL*
Peggotty
and
Mr.
Dick
took
that
opportunity
of
repairing
to
the
*NL*
chandler
's
shop
together
.
I
parted
from
him
,
poor
fellow
,
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
street
,
with
his
great
kite
at
his
back
,
a
very
monument
of
human
*NL*
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
when
I
returned
,
crimping
the
*NL*
borders
of
her
nightcap
with
her
fingers
.
I
warmed
the
ale
and
made
the
*NL*
toast
on
the
usual
infallible
principles
.
When
it
was
ready
for
her
,
she
*NL*
was
ready
for
it
,
with
her
nightcap
on
,
and
the
skirt
of
her
gown
turned
*NL*
back
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
after
taking
a
spoonful
of
it
;
``
it
's
a
great
*NL*
deal
better
than
wine
.
Not
half
so
bilious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
I
looked
doubtful
,
for
she
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
tut
,
child
.
If
nothing
worse
than
Ale
happens
to
us
,
we
are
well
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
myself
,
aunt
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
why
_
do
n't
_
you
think
so
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
and
I
are
very
different
people
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stuff
and
nonsense
,
Trot
!
''
replied
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
went
on
with
a
quiet
enjoyment
,
in
which
there
was
very
little
*NL*
affectation
,
if
any
;
drinking
the
warm
ale
with
a
teaspoon
,
and
soaking
*NL*
her
strips
of
toast
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
do
n't
care
for
strange
faces
in
general
,
but
I
*NL*
rather
like
that
Barkis
of
yours
,
do
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
than
a
hundred
pounds
to
hear
you
say
so
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
most
extraordinary
world
,
''
observed
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
;
*NL*
``
how
that
woman
ever
got
into
it
with
that
name
,
is
unaccountable
to
me
.
*NL*
It
would
be
much
more
easy
to
be
born
a
Jackson
,
or
something
of
that
*NL*
sort
,
one
would
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
thinks
so
,
too
;
it
's
not
her
fault
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
not
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
rather
grudging
the
admission
;
``
but
*NL*
it
's
very
aggravating
.
However
,
she
's
Barkis
_
now
_
.
That
's
some
comfort
.
*NL*
Barkis
is
uncommonly
fond
of
you
,
Trot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
she
would
leave
undone
to
prove
it
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
I
believe
,
''
returned
my
aunt
.
``
Here
,
the
poor
fool
has
been
*NL*
begging
and
praying
about
handing
over
some
of
her
money
--
because
she
*NL*
has
got
too
much
of
it
!
A
simpleton
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
's
tears
of
pleasure
were
positively
trickling
down
into
the
warm
*NL*
ale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
the
most
ridiculous
creature
that
ever
was
born
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
``
I
knew
,
from
the
first
moment
when
I
saw
her
with
that
poor
dear
*NL*
blessed
baby
of
a
mother
of
yours
,
that
she
was
the
most
ridiculous
of
*NL*
mortals
.
But
there
are
good
points
in
Barkis
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Affecting
to
laugh
,
she
got
an
opportunity
of
putting
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
eyes
.
Having
availed
herself
of
it
,
she
resumed
her
toast
and
her
*NL*
discourse
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mercy
upon
us
!
''
sighed
my
aunt
.
``
I
know
all
about
it
,
Trot

Barkis
*NL*
and
myself
had
quite
a
gossip
while
you
were
out
with
Dick
.
I
know
all
*NL*
about
it
.
I
do
n't
know
where
these
wretched
girls
expect
to
go
to
,
for
*NL*
my
part
.
I
wonder
they
do
n't
knock
out
their
brains
against
--
against
*NL*
mantelpieces
,
''
said
my
aunt
;
an
idea
which
was
probably
suggested
to
her
*NL*
by
her
contemplation
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Emily
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
talk
to
me
about
poor

returned
my
aunt
.
``
She
should
have
*NL*
thought
of
that
,
before
she
caused
so
much
misery

Give
me
a
kiss

.
*NL*
I
am
sorry
for
your
early
experience

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
bent
forward
,
she
put
her
tumbler
on
my
knee
to
detain
me
,
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Trot
,
Trot

And
so
you
fancy
yourself
in
love
!
Do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fancy

I
exclaimed
,
as
red
as
I
could
be
.
``
I
adore
her
with
my
*NL*
whole
soul

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dora

indeed

returned
my
aunt
.
``
And
you
mean
to
say
the
little
thing
*NL*
is
very
fascinating
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
aunt

I
replied
,
``
no
one
can
form
the
least
idea
what
she
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
And
not
silly
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silly
,
aunt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
seriously
believe
it
had
never
once
entered
my
head
for
a
single
*NL*
moment
,
to
consider
whether
she
was
or
not
.
I
resented
the
idea
,
of
*NL*
course
;
but
I
was
in
a
manner
struck
by
it
,
as
a
new
one
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
light-headed
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Light-headed
,
aunt
!
''
I
could
only
repeat
this
daring
speculation
with
*NL*
the
same
kind
of
feeling
with
which
I
had
repeated
the
preceding
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
only
ask

I
do
n't
depreciate
her

little

And
so
you

were
formed
for
one
another
,
and
are
*NL*
to
go
through
a
party-supper-table
kind
of
life

like
two
pretty
pieces

of
confectionary

*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
me
this
so
kindly
,
and
with
such
a
gentle
air
,
half
playful
*NL*
and
half
sorrowful
,
that
I
was
quite
touched

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
young

inexperienced

I
replied
;

am
sure

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
my

shaking
her
head
,
and
smiling
gravely
;

*NL*
*NL*
``

my

pursued
,
after
a
pause
,
``

a

pliant

an
earnestness

Earnestness

*NL*
``

she
said
again
;
``

and
without
knowing
why
,
I
*NL*
felt
a
vague
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
overshadow
me
like
a
*NL*
cloud

*NL*
*NL*
``
However

said
my

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
upon
the
whole
very
comforting
to
a
rapturous
lover
;
but
I
*NL*
was
glad
to
have
my
aunt
in
my
confidence
,
and
I
was
mindful
of
her
*NL*
being
fatigued
.
So
I
thanked
her
ardently
for
this
mark
of
her
*NL*
affection
,
and
for
all
her
other
kindnesses
towards
me
;
and
after
a
*NL*
tender
good
night
,
she
took
her
nightcap
into
my
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
miserable
I
was
,
when
I
lay
down
!
How
I
thought
and
thought
about
my
*NL*
being
poor
,
in
Mr.
Spenlow
's
eyes
;
about
my
not
being
what
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
,
when
I
proposed
to
Dora
;
about
the
chivalrous
necessity
of
telling
*NL*
Dora
what
my
worldly
condition
was
,
and
releasing
her
from
her
*NL*
engagement
if
she
thought
fit
;
about
how
I
should
contrive
to
live
,
*NL*
during
the
long
term
of
my
articles
,
when
I
was
earning
nothing
;
about
*NL*
doing
something
to
assist
my
aunt
,
and
seeing
no
way
of
doing
anything
;
*NL*
about
coming
down
to
have
no
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
to
wear
a
shabby
*NL*
coat
,
and
to
be
able
to
carry
Dora
no
little
presents
,
and
to
ride
no
*NL*
gallant
greys
,
and
to
show
myself
in
no
agreeable
light
!
Sordid
and
*NL*
selfish
as
I
knew
it
was
,
and
as
I
tortured
myself
by
knowing
that
it
*NL*
was
,
to
let
my
mind
run
on
my
own
distress
so
much
,
I
was
so
devoted
to
*NL*
Dora
that
I
could
not
help
it
.
I
knew
that
it
was
base
in
me
not
to
*NL*
think
more
of
my
aunt
,
and
less
of
myself
;
but
,
so
far
,
selfishness
was
*NL*
inseparable
from
Dora
,
and
I
could
not
put
Dora
on
one
side
for
any
*NL*
mortal
creature
.
How
exceedingly
miserable
I
was
,
that
night
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
sleep
,
I
had
dreams
of
poverty
in
all
sorts
of
shapes
,
but
I
*NL*
seemed
to
dream
without
the
previous
ceremony
of
going
to
sleep
.
Now
I
*NL*
was
ragged
,
wanting
to
sell
Dora
matches
,
six
bundles
for
a
halfpenny
;
*NL*
now
I
was
at
the
office
in
a
nightgown
and
boots
,
remonstrated
with
by
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
on
appearing
before
the
clients
in
that
airy
attire
;
now
I
*NL*
was
hungrily
picking
up
the
crumbs
that
fell
from
old
Tiffey
's
daily
*NL*
biscuit
,
regularly
eaten
when
Saint
Paul
's
struck
one
;
now
I
was
*NL*
hopelessly
endeavouring
to
get
a
license
to
marry
Dora
,
having
nothing
*NL*
but
one
of
Uriah
Heep
's
gloves
to
offer
in
exchange
,
which
the
whole
*NL*
Commons
rejected
;
and
still
,
more
or
less
conscious
of
my
own
room
,
I
*NL*
was
always
tossing
about
like
a
distressed
ship
in
a
sea
of
bed-clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
restless
,
too
,
for
I
frequently
heard
her
walking
to
and
*NL*
fro
.
Two
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
attired
in
a
long
*NL*
flannel
wrapper
in
which
she
looked
seven
feet
high
,
she
appeared
,
like
*NL*
a
disturbed
ghost
,
in
my
room
,
and
came
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
on
which
*NL*
I
lay
.
On
the
first
occasion
I
started
up
in
alarm
,
to
learn
that
she
*NL*
inferred
from
a
particular
light
in
the
sky
,
that
Westminster
Abbey
was
*NL*
on
fire
;
and
to
be
consulted
in
reference
to
the
probability
of
its
*NL*
igniting
Buckingham
Street
,
in
case
the
wind
changed
.
Lying
still
,
after
*NL*
that
,
I
found
that
she
sat
down
near
me
,
whispering
to
herself
``
Poor
*NL*
boy
!
''
And
then
it
made
me
twenty
times
more
wretched
,
to
know
how
*NL*
unselfishly
mindful
she
was
of
me
,
and
how
selfishly
mindful
I
was
of
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
difficult
to
believe
that
a
night
so
long
to
me
,
could
be
short
*NL*
to
anybody
else
.
This
consideration
set
me
thinking
and
thinking
of
an
*NL*
imaginary
party
where
people
were
dancing
the
hours
away
,
until
that
*NL*
became
a
dream
too
,
and
I
heard
the
music
incessantly
playing
one
tune
,
*NL*
and
saw
Dora
incessantly
dancing
one
dance
,
without
taking
the
least
*NL*
notice
of
me
.
The
man
who
had
been
playing
the
harp
all
night
,
was
*NL*
trying
in
vain
to
cover
it
with
an
ordinary
sized
nightcap
,
when
I
*NL*
awoke
;
or
I
should
rather
say
,
when
I
left
off
trying
to
go
to
sleep
,
*NL*
and
saw
the
sun
shining
in
through
the
window
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
old
Roman
bath
in
those
days
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
*NL*
streets
out
of
the
Strand
--
it
may
be
there
still
--
in
which
I
have
had
*NL*
many
a
cold
plunge
.
Dressing
myself
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
and
leaving
*NL*
Peggotty
to
look
after
my
aunt
,
I
tumbled
head
foremost
into
it
,
and
*NL*
then
went
for
a
walk
to
Hampstead
.
I
had
a
hope
that
this
brisk
*NL*
treatment
might
freshen
my
wits
a
little
;
and
I
think
it
did
them
good
,
*NL*
for
I
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
first
step
I
ought
to
take
*NL*
was
,
to
try
if
my
articles
could
be
cancelled
and
the
premium
recovered
.
*NL*
I
got
some
breakfast
on
the
Heath
,
and
walked
back
to
Doctors
'
Commons
,
*NL*
along
the
watered
roads
and
through
a
pleasant
smell
of
summer
flowers
,
*NL*
growing
in
gardens
and
carried
into
town
on
hucksters
'
heads
,
intent
on
*NL*
this
first
effort
to
meet
our
altered
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
arrived
at
the
office
so
soon
,
after
all
,
that
I
had
half
an
hour
's
*NL*
loitering
about
the
Commons
,
before
old
Tiffey
,
who
was
always
first
,
*NL*
appeared
with
his
key
.
Then
I
sat
down
in
my
shady
corner
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
the
sunlight
on
the
opposite
chimney-pots
,
and
thinking
about
Dora
;
*NL*
until
Mr.
Spenlow
came
in
,
crisp
and
curly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Copperfield
?
''
said
he
.
``
Fine
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
morning
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
``
Could
I
say
a
word
to
you
before
you
*NL*
go
into
Court
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
said
he
.
``
Come
into
my
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
him
into
his
room
,
and
he
began
putting
on
his
gown
,
and
*NL*
touching
himself
up
before
a
little
glass
he
had
,
hanging
inside
a
*NL*
closet
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
have
some
rather
disheartening
*NL*
intelligence
from
my
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
he
.
``
Dear
me
!
Not
paralysis
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
no
reference
to
her
health
,
sir
,
''
I
replied
.
``
She
has
met
with
*NL*
some
large
losses
.
In
fact
,
she
has
very
little
left
,
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
as-tound
me
,
Copperfield
!
''
cried
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
her
affairs
are
so
changed
,
*NL*
that
I
wished
to
ask
you
whether
it
would
be
possible
--
at
a
sacrifice
on
*NL*
our
part
of
some
portion
of
the
premium
,
of
course
,
''
I
put
in
this
,
on
*NL*
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
warned
by
the
blank
expression
of
his
face
--
``
to
*NL*
cancel
my
articles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
it
cost
me
to
make
this
proposal
,
nobody
knows
.
It
was
like
asking
,
*NL*
as
a
favor
,
to
be
sentenced
to
transportation
from
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
cancel
your
articles
,
Copperfield
?
Cancel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
with
tolerable
firmness
,
that
I
really
did
not
know
where
my
*NL*
means
of
subsistence
were
to
come
from
,
unless
I
could
earn
them
for
*NL*
myself
.
I
had
no
fear
for
the
future
,
I
said
--
and
I
laid
great
emphasis
*NL*
on
that
,
as
if
to
imply
that
I
should
still
be
decidedly
eligible
for
a
*NL*
son-in-law
one
of
these
days
--
but
,
for
the
present
,
I
was
thrown
upon
my
*NL*
own
resources
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extremely
sorry
to
hear
this
,
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
``
Extremely
sorry
.
It
is
not
usual
to
cancel
articles
for
any
such
*NL*
reason
.
It
is
not
a
professional
course
of
proceeding
.
It
is
not
a
*NL*
convenient
precedent
at
all

Far
from
it
.
At
the
same
time
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
sir

''
I
murmured
,
anticipating
a
concession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

Do
n't
mention
it
,

said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
``
At
the

going

been
my

hands
unfettered

*NL*
I
had
not
a
partner

Mr.
Jorkins

--
*NL*
*NL*
My
hopes
were
dashed
in
a
moment
,
but
I
made
another
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think

said
I
,
``
if
I
were
to
mention
it

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
shook
his
head
discouragingly
.
``
Heaven
forbid

Copperfield

''
*NL*
he
replied
,
``
that
I
should
do
any
man
an
injustice

still
less
,
Mr.

Jorkins

But
I

partner

Copperfield

Mr.
Jorkins
is
_
not
_
a
man
*NL*
to
respond
to
a
proposition
of
this
peculiar
nature
.
Mr.
Jorkins
is
very
*NL*
difficult
to
move
from
the
beaten
track
.
You
know
what
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sure
I
knew
nothing
about
him
,
except
that
he
had
originally
been
*NL*
alone
in
the
business
,
and
now
lived
by
himself
in
a
house
near
Montagu
*NL*
Square
,
which
was
fearfully
in
want
of
painting
;
that
he
came
very
late
*NL*
of
a
day
,
and
went
away
very
early
;
that
he
never
appeared
to
be
*NL*
consulted
about
anything
;
and
that
he
had
a
dingy
little
black-hole
of
*NL*
his
own
up-stairs
,
where
no
business
was
ever
done
,
and
where
there
was
*NL*
a
yellow
old
cartridge-paper
pad
upon
his
desk
,
unsoiled
by
ink
,
and
*NL*
reported
to
be
twenty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
object
to
my
mentioning
it
to
him

''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no

said
Mr.
Spenlow

``
But
I
have
some

you

it
worth

''
*NL*
*NL*
Availing
myself
of
this
permission
,
which
was
given
with
a
warm
shake
of
*NL*
the
hand
,
I
sat
thinking
about
Dora
,
and
looking
at
the
sunlight
*NL*
stealing
from
the
chimney-pots
down
the
wall
of
the
opposite
house
,
*NL*
until
Mr.
Jorkins
came
.
I
then
went
up
to
Mr.
Jorkins
's
room
,
and
*NL*
evidently
astonished
Mr.
Jorkins
very
much
by
making
my
appearance
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Jorkins
.
``
Come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
in
,
and
sat
down
;
and
stated
my
case
to
Mr.
Jorkins
pretty
much
*NL*
as
I
had
stated
it
to
Mr.
Spenlow
.
Mr.
Jorkins
was
not
by
any
means
the
*NL*
awful
creature
one
might
have
expected
,
but
a
large
,
mild
,
smooth-faced
*NL*
man
of
sixty
,
who
took
so
much
snuff
that
there
was
a
tradition
in
the
*NL*
Commons
that
he
lived
principally
on
that
stimulant
,
having
little
room
*NL*
in
his
system
for
any
other
article
of
diet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
mentioned
this
to
Mr.
Spenlow
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Mr.
Jorkins
;
*NL*
when
he
had
heard
me
,
very
restlessly
,
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
Yes
,
and
told
him
that
Mr.
Spenlow
had
introduced
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
I
should
object
?
''
asked
Mr.
Jorkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
admit
that
Mr.
Spenlow
had
considered
it
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
I
ca
n't
advance
your
object
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Jorkins
,
nervously
.
``
The
fact
is
--
but
I
have
an
appointment
at
the
*NL*
Bank

you
'll
have
the

to
excuse
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
rose
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
was
going
out
of
the
room
,
when
*NL*
I
made
bold
to
say
that
I
feared
,
then
,
there
was
no
way
of
arranging
*NL*
the
matter
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Mr.
Jorkins
,
stopping
at
the
door
to
shake
his
head
.
``
Oh
,
no
!
*NL*
I
object
,
you
know
,
''
which
he
said
very
rapidly
,
and
went
out
.
``
You
must
*NL*
be
aware
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
he
added
,
looking
restlessly
in
at
the
door
*NL*
again
,
``
if
Mr.
Spenlow
objects

*NL*
*NL*
``
Personally
,
he
does
not
object

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Personally
!
''
repeated
Mr.
Jorkins
,
in
an
impatient
manner
.
``
I
*NL*
assure
you
there
's
an
objection

Mr.

ca

I
--
I
really

*NL*
the

''
With
that
he
fairly
ran
away
;
and
to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
knowledge
,
it
was
three
days
before
he
showed
himself
in
the
Commons
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
very
anxious
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
,
I
waited
until
Mr.
*NL*
Spenlow
came
in
,
and
then
described
what
had
passed
;
giving
him
to
*NL*
understand
that
I
was
not
hopeless
of
his
being
able
to
soften
the
*NL*
adamantine
Jorkins
,
if
he
would
undertake
that
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Mr.
Spenlow
,
with
a
sagacious
smile
,
``
you
have
*NL*
not
known
my
partner
,
Mr.
Jorkins
,
as
long
as
I
have
.
Nothing
is
farther
*NL*
from
my
thoughts
than
to
attribute
any
degree
of
artifice
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jorkins
.
But
Mr.
Jorkins
has
a
way
of
stating
his
objections
which
often
*NL*
deceives
people
.
No
,
Copperfield
!
''
shaking
his
head
.
``
Mr.
Jorkins
is
not
*NL*
to
be
moved
,
believe
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
completely
bewildered
between
Mr.
Spenlow
and
Mr.
Jorkins
,
as
to
*NL*
which
of
them
really
was
the
objecting
partner
;
but
I
saw
with
*NL*
sufficient
clearness
that
there
was
obduracy
somewhere
in
the
firm
,
and
*NL*
that
the
recovery
of
my
aunt
's
thousand
pounds
was
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
In
a
state
of
despondency
,
which
I
remember
with
anything
but
*NL*
satisfaction
,
for
I
know
it
still
had
too
much
reference
to
myself
*NL*
-LRB-
though
always
in
connexion
with
Dora
-RRB-
,
I
left
the
office
,
and
went
*NL*
homeward
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
trying
to
familiarise
my
mind
with
the
worst
,
and
to
present
to
*NL*
myself
the
arrangements
we
should
have
to
make
for
the
future
in
their
*NL*
sternest
aspect
,
when
a
hackney
chariot
coming
after
me
,
and
stopping
at
*NL*
my
very
feet
,
occasioned
me
to
look
up
.
A
fair
hand
was
stretched
forth
*NL*
to
me
from
the
window
;
and
the
face
I
had
never
seen
without
a
feeling
*NL*
of
serenity
and
happiness
,
from
the
moment
when
it
first
turned
back
on
*NL*
the
old
oak
staircase
with
the
great
broad
balustrade
,
and
when
I
*NL*
associated
its
softened
beauty
with
the
stained
glass
window
in
the
*NL*
church
,
was
smiling
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
!
''
I
joyfully
exclaimed
.
``
Oh
,
my
dear
Agnes
,
of
all
people
in
the
*NL*
world
,
what
a
pleasure
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
,
indeed
?
''
she
said
,
in
her
cordial
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
talk
to
you
so
much
!
''
said
I.
``
It
's
such
a
lightening
of
my
*NL*
heart
,
only
to
look
at
you
!
If
I
had
had
a
conjuror
's
cap
,
there
is
no
*NL*
one
I
should
have
wished
for
but
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
returned
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
perhaps
Dora
,
first
,
''
I
admitted
,
with
a
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
Dora
first
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Agnes
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
next
!
''
said
I.
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
to
my
rooms
to
see
my
aunt
.
The
day
being
very
fine
,
she
*NL*
was
glad
to
come
out
of
the
chariot
,
which
smelt
-LRB-
I
had
my
head
in
it
*NL*
all
this
time
-RRB-
like
a
stable
put
under
a
cucumber-frame
.
I
dismissed
the
*NL*
coachman
,
and
she
took
my
arm
,
and
we
walked
on
together
.
She
was
like
*NL*
Hope
embodied
,
to
me
.
How
different
I
felt
in
one
short
minute
,
having
*NL*
Agnes
at
my
side
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
had
written
her
one
of
the
odd
,
abrupt
notes
--
very
little
longer
*NL*
than
a
Bank
note
--
to
which
her
epistolary
efforts
were
usually
limited
.
*NL*
She
had
stated
therein
that
she
had
fallen
into
adversity
,
and
was
*NL*
leaving
Dover
for
good
,
but
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
to
it
,
and
was
so
*NL*
well
that
nobody
need
be
uncomfortable
about
her
.
Agnes
had
come
to
*NL*
London
to
see
my
aunt
,
between
whom
and
herself
there
had
been
a
mutual
*NL*
liking
these
many
years
:
indeed
,
it
dated
from
the
time
of
my
taking
up
*NL*
my
residence
in
Mr.
Wickfield
's
house
.
She
was
not
alone
,
she
said
.
Her
*NL*
papa
was
with
her
--
and
Uriah
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
they
are
partners
,
''
said
I.
``
Confound
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Agnes
.
``
They
have
some
business
here
;
and
I
took
advantage
*NL*
of
their
coming
,
to
come
too
.
You
must
not
think
my
visit
all
friendly
*NL*
and
disinterested
,
Trotwood
,
for
--
I
am
afraid
I
may
be
cruelly
*NL*
prejudiced
--
I
do
not
like
to
let
papa
go
away
alone
,
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
exercise
the
same
influence
over
Mr.
Wickfield
still
,
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
shook
her
head
.
``
There
is
such
a
change
at
home
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
*NL*
you
would
scarcely
know
the
dear
old
house
.
They
live
with
us
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Heep
and
his
mother
.
He
sleeps
in
your
old
room
,
''
said
Agnes
,
*NL*
looking
up
into
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
the
ordering
of
his
dreams
,
''
said
I.
``
He
would
n't
sleep
*NL*
there
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
keep
my
own
little
room
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
where
I
used
to
learn
my
*NL*
lessons
.
How
the
time
goes
!
You
remember
?
The
little
panelled
room
that
*NL*
opens
from
the
drawing-room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
Agnes
?
When
I
saw
you
,
for
the
first
time
,
coming
out
at
the
*NL*
door
,
with
your
quaint
little
basket
of
keys
hanging
at
your
side
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
the
same
,
''
said
Agnes
,
smiling
.
``
I
am
glad
you
think
of
it
*NL*
so
pleasantly
.
We
were
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
,
indeed
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
keep
that
room
to
myself
still
;
but
I
can
not
always
desert
Mrs.
Heep
,
*NL*
you
know
.
And
so
,
''
said
Agnes
quietly
,
``
I
feel
obliged
to
bear
her
*NL*
company
,
when
I
might
prefer
to
be
alone
.
But
I
have
no
other
reason
to
*NL*
complain
of
her
.
If
she
tires
me
,
sometimes
,
by
her
praises
of
her
son
,
*NL*
it
is
only
natural
in
a
mother
.
He
is
a
very
good
son
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
Agnes
when
she
said
these
words
,
without
detecting
in
her
*NL*
any
consciousness
of
Uriah
's
design
.
Her
mild
but
earnest
eyes
met
mine
*NL*
with
their
own
beautiful
frankness
,
and
there
was
no
change
in
her
*NL*
gentle
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chief
evil
of
their
presence
in
the
house
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
is
that
I
*NL*
can
not
be
as
near
papa
as
I
could
wish
--
Uriah
Heep
being
so
much
between
*NL*
us
--
and
can
not
watch
over
him
,
if
that
is
not
too
bold
a
thing
to
say
,
*NL*
as
closely
as
I
would
.
But
,
if
any
fraud
or
treachery
is
practising
*NL*
against
him
,
I
hope
that
simple
love
and
truth
will
be
stronger
,
in
the
*NL*
end
.
I
hope
that
real
love
and
truth
are
stronger
in
the
end
than
any
*NL*
evil
or
misfortune
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
bright
smile
which
I
never
saw
on
any
other
face
,
died
away
,
*NL*
even
while
I
thought
how
good
it
was
,
and
how
familiar
it
had
once
been
*NL*
to
me
;
and
she
asked
me
,
with
a
quick
change
of
expression
-LRB-
we
were
*NL*
drawing
very
near
my
street
-RRB-
,
if
I
knew
how
the
reverse
in
my
aunt
's
*NL*
circumstances
had
been
brought
about
.
On
my
replying
no
,
she
had
not
*NL*
told
me
yet
,
Agnes
became
thoughtful
,
and
I
fancied
I
felt
her
arm
*NL*
tremble
in
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
my
aunt
alone
,
in
a
state
of
some
excitement
.
A
difference
of
*NL*
opinion
had
arisen
between
herself
and
Mrs.
Crupp
,
on
an
abstract
*NL*
question
-LRB-
the
propriety
of
chambers
being
inhabited
by
the
gentler
sex
-RRB-
;
*NL*
and
my
aunt
,
utterly
indifferent
to
spasms
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Crupp
,
*NL*
had
cut
the
dispute
short
,
by
informing
that
lady
that
she
smelt
of
my
*NL*
brandy
,
and
that
she
would
trouble
her
to
walk
out
.
Both
of
these
*NL*
expressions
Mrs.
Crupp
considered
actionable
,
and
had
expressed
her
*NL*
intention
of
bringing
before
a
``
British
Judy
''
--
meaning
,
it
was
supposed
,
*NL*
the
bulwark
of
our
national
liberties
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
however
,
having
had
time
to
cool
,
while
Peggotty
was
out
*NL*
showing
Mr.
Dick
the
soldiers
at
the
Horse
Guards
--
and
being
,
besides
,
*NL*
greatly
pleased
to
see
Agnes
--
rather
plumed
herself
on
the
affair
than
*NL*
otherwise
,
and
received
us
with
unimpaired
good
humour
.
When
Agnes
laid
*NL*
her
bonnet
on
the
table
,
and
sat
down
beside
her
,
I
could
not
but
think
,
*NL*
looking
on
her
mild
eyes
and
her
radiant
forehead
,
how
natural
it
seemed
*NL*
to
have
her
there
;
how
trustfully
,
although
she
was
so
young
and
*NL*
inexperienced
,
my
aunt
confided
in
her
;
how
strong
she
was
,
indeed
,
in
*NL*
simple
love
and
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
began
to
talk
about
my
aunt
's
losses
,
and
I
told
them
what
I
had
*NL*
tried
to
do
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
was
injudicious
,
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
but
well
meant
.
You
are
a
*NL*
generous
boy
--
I
suppose
I
must
say
,
young
man
,
now
--
and
I
am
proud
of
*NL*
you
,
my
dear
.
So
far
,
so
good
.
Now
,
Trot
and
Agnes
,
let
us
look
the
case
*NL*
of
Betsey
Trotwood
in
the
face
,
and
see
how
it
stands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
observed
Agnes
turn
pale
,
as
she
looked
very
attentively
at
my
aunt
.
*NL*
My
aunt
,
patting
her
cat
,
looked
very
attentively
at
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Betsey
Trotwood
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
who
had
always
kept
her
money
matters
*NL*
to
herself
:
''
--
I
do
n't
mean
your
sister
,
Trot
,
my
dear
,
but
myself
--
had
*NL*
a
certain
property
.
It
do
n't
matter
how
much
;
enough
to
live
on
.
More
;
*NL*
for
she
had
saved
a
little
,
and
added
to
it
.
Betsey
funded
her
property
*NL*
for
some
time
,
and
then
,
by
the
advice
of
her
man
of
business
,
laid
*NL*
it
out
on
landed
security
.
That
did
very
well
,
and
returned
very
good
*NL*
interest
,
till
Betsey
was
paid
off
.
I
am
talking
of
Betsey
as
if
she
*NL*
was
a
man-of-war
.
Well
!
Then
,
Betsey
had
to
look
about
her
,
for
a
new
*NL*
investment
.
She
thought
she
was
wiser
,
now
,
than
her
man
of
business
,
*NL*
who
was
not
such
a
good
man
of
business
by
this
time
,
as
he
used
to
*NL*
be
--
I
am
alluding
to
your
father
,
Agnes
--
and
she
took
it
into
her
head
*NL*
to
lay
it
out
for
herself
.
So
she
took
her
pigs
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
to
a
*NL*
foreign
market
;
and
a
very
bad
market
it
turned
out
to
be
.
First
,
she
*NL*
lost
in
the
mining
way
,
and
then
she
lost
in
the
diving
way
--
fishing
up
*NL*
treasure
,
or
some
such
Tom
Tidler
nonsense
,
''
explained
my
aunt
,
rubbing
*NL*
her
nose
;
``
and
then
she
lost
in
the
mining
way
again
,
and
,
last
of
all
,
*NL*
to
set
the
thing
entirely
to
rights
,
she
lost
in
the
banking
way
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
the
Bank
shares
were
worth
for
a
little
while
,
''
said
my
*NL*
aunt
;
``
cent
per
cent
was
the
lowest
of
it
,
I
believe
;
but
the
Bank
was
*NL*
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
and
tumbled
into
space
,
for
what
I
know
;
*NL*
anyhow
,
it
fell
to
pieces
,
and
never
will
and
never
can
pay
sixpence
;
*NL*
and
Betsey
's
sixpences
were
all
there
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
them
.
*NL*
Least
said
,
soonest
mended
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
concluded
this
philosophical
summary
,
by
fixing
her
eyes
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
triumph
on
Agnes
,
whose
color
was
gradually
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Miss
Trotwood
,
is
that
all
the
history
?
''
said
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
's
enough
,
child
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
If
there
had
been
more
money
*NL*
to
lose
,
it
would
n't
have
been
all
,
I
dare
say
.
Betsey
would
have
*NL*
contrived
to
throw
that
after
the
rest
,
and
make
another
chapter
,
I
have
*NL*
little
doubt
.
But
,
there
was
no
more
money
,
and
there
's
no
more
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
had
listened
at
first
with
suspended
breath
.
Her
color
still
came
*NL*
and
went
,
but
she
breathed
more
freely
.
I
thought
I
knew
why
.
I
thought
*NL*
she
had
had
some
fear
that
her
unhappy
father
might
be
in
some
way
to
*NL*
blame
for
what
had
happened
.
My
aunt
took
her
hand
in
hers
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
repeated
my
aunt
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
that
's
all
,
except
,
`
And
she
*NL*
lived
happy
ever
afterwards
.
'
Perhaps
I
may
add
that
of
Betsey
yet
,
one
*NL*
of
these
days
.
Now
,
Agnes
,
you
have
a
wise
head
.
So
have
you
,
Trot
,
in
*NL*
some
things
,
though
I
ca
n't
compliment
you
always
;
''
and
here
my
aunt
*NL*
shook
her
own
at
me
,
with
an
energy
peculiar
to
herself
.
``
What
's
to
be
*NL*
done
?
Here
's
the
cottage
,
taking
one
time
with
another
,
will
produce
,
*NL*
say
seventy
pounds
a-year
.
I
think
we
may
safely
put
it
down
at
that
.
*NL*
Well
!
--
That
's
all
we
've
got
,
''
said
my
aunt
;
with
whom
it
was
an
*NL*
idiosyncrasy
,
as
it
is
with
some
horses
,
to
stop
very
short
when
she
*NL*
appeared
to
be
in
a
fair
way
of
going
on
for
a
long
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
after
a
rest
,
``
there
's
Dick
.
He
's
good
for
a
*NL*
hundred
a-year
,
but
of
course
that
must
be
expended
on
himself
.
I
would
*NL*
sooner
send
him
away
,
though
I
know
I
am
the
only
person
who
appreciates
*NL*
him
,
than
have
him
,
and
not
spend
his
money
on
himself
.
How
can
Trot
and
*NL*
I
do
best
,
upon
our
means
?
What
do
you
say
,
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
say
,
aunt
,
''
I
interposed
,
``
that
I
must
do
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
for
a
soldier
,
do
you
mean
?
''
returned
my
aunt
,
alarmed
;
``
or
go
to
*NL*
sea
?
I
wo
n't
hear
of
it
.
You
are
to
be
a
proctor
.
We
're
not
going
to
*NL*
have
any
knockings
on
the
head
in
_
this
_
family
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
about
to
explain
that
I
was
not
desirous
of
introducing
that
mode
*NL*
of
provision
into
the
family
,
when
Agnes
inquired
if
my
rooms
were
held
*NL*
for
any
long
term
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
to
the
point
,
my
dear
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
They
are
not
to
be
got
*NL*
rid
of
,
for
six
months
at
least
,
unless
they
could
be
underlet
,
and
that
*NL*
I
do
n't
believe
.
The
last
man
died
here
.
Five
people
out
of
six
_
would
_
*NL*
die
--
of
course
--
of
that
woman
in
nankeen
with
the
flannel
petticoat
.
I
*NL*
have
a
little
ready
money
;
and
I
agree
with
you
,
the
best
thing
we
can
*NL*
do
,
is
,
to
live
the
term
out
here
,
and
get
Dick
a
bed-room
hard
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
hint
at
the
discomfort
my
aunt
would
sustain
,
*NL*
from
living
in
a
continual
state
of
guerilla
warfare
with
Mrs.
Crupp
;
*NL*
but
she
disposed
of
that
objection
summarily
by
declaring
,
that
,
on
the
*NL*
first
demonstration
of
hostilities
,
she
was
prepared
to
astonish
Mrs.
*NL*
Crupp
for
the
whole
remainder
of
her
natural
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
Trotwood
,
''
said
Agnes
,
diffidently
,
``
that
if
you
*NL*
had
time
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
good
deal
of
time
,
Agnes
.
I
am
always
disengaged
after
four
or
*NL*
five
o'clock
,
and
I
have
time
early
in
the
morning
.
In
one
way
and
*NL*
another
,
''
said
I
,
conscious
of
reddening
a
little
as
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
hours
and
hours
I
had
devoted
to
fagging
about
town
,
and
to
and
fro
upon
*NL*
the
Norwood
Road
,
``
I
have
abundance
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
would
not
mind
,
''
said
Agnes
,
coming
to
me
,
and
speaking
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
,
so
full
of
sweet
and
hopeful
consideration
that
I
hear
it
*NL*
now
,
``
the
duties
of
a
secretary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
my
dear
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
continued
Agnes
,
``
Doctor
Strong
has
acted
on
his
intention
of
*NL*
retiring
,
and
has
come
to
live
in
London
;
and
he
asked
papa
,
I
know
,
if
*NL*
he
could
recommend
him
one
.
Do
n't
you
think
he
would
rather
have
his
*NL*
favorite
old
pupil
near
him
,
than
anybody
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Agnes
!
''
said
I.
``
What
should
I
do
without
you
!
You
are
always
my
*NL*
good
angel
.
I
told
you
so
.
I
never
think
of
you
in
any
other
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
answered
with
her
pleasant
laugh
,
that
one
good
angel
-LRB-
meaning
*NL*
Dora
-RRB-
was
enough
;
and
went
on
to
remind
me
that
the
Doctor
had
been
*NL*
used
to
occupy
himself
in
his
study
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
*NL*
evening
--
and
that
probably
my
leisure
would
suit
his
requirements
very
*NL*
well
.
I
was
scarcely
more
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
earning
my
*NL*
own
bread
,
than
with
the
hope
of
earning
it
under
my
old
master
;
in
*NL*
short
,
acting
on
the
advice
of
Agnes
,
I
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
*NL*
to
the
Doctor
,
stating
my
object
,
and
appointing
to
call
on
him
next
*NL*
day
at
ten
in
the
forenoon
.
This
I
addressed
to
Highgate
--
for
in
that
*NL*
place
,
so
memorable
to
me
,
he
lived
--
and
went
out
and
posted
,
myself
,
*NL*
without
losing
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherever
Agnes
was
,
some
agreeable
token
of
her
noiseless
presence
*NL*
seemed
inseparable
from
the
place
.
When
I
came
back
,
I
found
my
aunt
's
*NL*
birds
hanging
,
just
as
they
had
hung
so
long
in
the
parlor
window
of
the
*NL*
cottage
;
and
my
easy
chair
imitating
my
aunt
's
much
easier
chair
in
its
*NL*
position
at
the
open
window
;
and
even
the
round
green
fan
,
which
my
aunt
*NL*
had
brought
away
with
her
,
screwed
on
to
the
window-sill
.
I
knew
who
had
*NL*
done
all
this
,
by
its
seeming
to
have
quietly
done
itself
;
and
I
should
*NL*
have
known
in
a
moment
who
had
arranged
my
neglected
books
in
the
old
*NL*
order
of
my
school
days
,
even
if
I
had
supposed
Agnes
to
be
miles
away
,
*NL*
instead
of
seeing
her
busy
with
them
,
and
smiling
at
the
disorder
into
*NL*
which
they
had
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
was
quite
gracious
on
the
subject
of
the
Thames
-LRB-
it
really
did
*NL*
look
very
well
with
the
sun
upon
it
,
though
not
like
the
sea
before
the
*NL*
cottage
-RRB-
,
but
she
could
not
relent
towards
the
London
smoke
,
which
,
she
*NL*
said
,
``
peppered
everything
.
''
A
complete
revolution
,
in
which
Peggotty
*NL*
bore
a
prominent
part
,
was
being
effected
in
every
corner
of
my
rooms
,
*NL*
in
regard
of
this
pepper
;
and
I
was
looking
on
,
thinking
how
little
even
*NL*
Peggotty
seemed
to
do
with
a
good
deal
of
bustle
,
and
how
much
Agnes
did
*NL*
without
any
bustle
at
all
,
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Agnes
,
turning
pale
,
``
it
's
papa
.
He
promised
me
that
he
*NL*
would
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
opened
the
door
,
and
admitted
,
not
only
Mr.
Wickfield
,
but
Uriah
Heep
.
*NL*
I
had
not
seen
Mr.
Wickfield
for
some
time
.
I
was
prepared
for
a
great
*NL*
change
in
him
,
after
what
I
had
heard
from
Agnes
,
but
his
appearance
*NL*
shocked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
Mr.
Wickfield
and
his
partner
wait
upon
my
Aunt
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
that
he
looked
many
years
older
,
though
still
dressed
with
*NL*
the
old
scrupulous
cleanliness
;
or
that
there
was
an
unwholesome
*NL*
ruddiness
upon
his
face
;
or
that
his
eyes
were
full
and
bloodshot
;
or
*NL*
that
there
was
a
nervous
trembling
in
his
hand
,
the
cause
of
which
I
*NL*
knew
,
and
had
for
some
years
seen
at
work
.
It
was
not
that
he
had
lost
*NL*
his
good
looks
,
or
his
old
bearing
of
a
gentleman
--
for
that
he
had
*NL*
not
--
but
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
,
was
,
that
with
the
evidences
*NL*
of
his
native
superiority
still
upon
him
,
he
should
submit
himself
to
*NL*
that
crawling
impersonation
of
meanness
,
Uriah
Heep
.
The
reversal
of
*NL*
the
two
natures
,
in
their
relative
positions
,
Uriah
's
of
power
and
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
's
of
dependence
,
was
a
sight
more
painful
to
me
than
I
can
*NL*
express
.
If
I
had
seen
an
Ape
taking
command
of
a
Man
,
I
should
hardly
*NL*
have
thought
it
a
more
degrading
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
to
be
only
too
conscious
of
it
himself
.
When
he
came
in
,
*NL*
he
stood
still
;
and
with
his
head
bowed
,
as
if
he
felt
it
.
This
was
*NL*
only
for
a
moment
;
for
Agnes
softly
said
to
him
,
``
Papa
!
Here
is
Miss
*NL*
Trotwood
--
and
Trotwood
,
whom
you
have
not
seen
for
a
long
while
!
''
and
*NL*
then
he
approached
,
and
constrainedly
gave
my
aunt
his
hand
,
and
shook
*NL*
hands
more
cordially
with
me
.
In
the
moment
's
pause
I
speak
of
,
I
saw
*NL*
Uriah
's
countenance
form
itself
into
a
most
ill-favored
smile
.
Agnes
*NL*
saw
it
too
,
I
think
,
for
she
shrank
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
my
aunt
saw
,
or
did
not
see
,
I
defy
the
science
of
physiognomy
to
*NL*
have
made
out
,
without
her
own
consent
.
I
believe
there
never
was
*NL*
anybody
with
such
an
imperturbable
countenance
when
she
chose
.
Her
face
*NL*
might
have
been
a
dead
wall
on
the
occasion
in
question
,
for
any
light
*NL*
it
threw
upon
her
thoughts
;
until
she
broke
silence
with
her
usual
*NL*
abruptness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Wickfield
!
''
said
my
aunt
;
and
he
looked
up
at
her
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
``
I
have
been
telling
your
daughter
how
well
I
have
been
disposing
*NL*
of
my
money
for
myself
,
because
I
could
n't
trust
it
to
you
,
as
you
were
*NL*
growing
rusty
in
business
matters
.
We
have
been
taking
counsel
together
,
*NL*
and
getting
on
very
well
,
all
things
considered
.
Agnes
is
worth
the
*NL*
whole
firm
,
in
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
may
umbly
make
the
remark
,
''
said
Uriah
Heep
,
with
a
writhe
,
``
I
*NL*
fully
agree
with
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
and
should
be
only
too
appy
if
*NL*
Miss
Agnes
was
a
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
partner
yourself
,
you
know
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
``
and
that
's
*NL*
about
enough
for
you
,
I
expect
.
How
do
you
find
yourself
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
acknowledgment
of
this
question
,
addressed
to
him
with
extraordinary
*NL*
curtness
,
Mr.
Heep
,
uncomfortably
clutching
the
blue
bag
he
carried
,
*NL*
replied
that
he
was
pretty
well
,
he
thanked
my
aunt
,
and
hoped
she
was
*NL*
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Master
--
I
should
say
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
''
pursued
Uriah
.
``
I
*NL*
hope
I
see
you
well
!
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
even
*NL*
under
present
circumstances
.
''
I
believed
that
;
for
he
seemed
to
relish
*NL*
them
very
much
.
``
Present
circumstances
is
not
what
your
friends
would
*NL*
wish
for
you
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
but
it
is
n't
money
makes
the
man
:
*NL*
it
's
--
I
am
really
unequal
with
my
umble
powers
to
express
what
it
is
,
''
*NL*
said
Uriah
,
with
a
fawning
jerk
,
``
but
it
is
n't
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
shook
hands
with
me
:
not
in
the
common
way
,
but
standing
at
a
*NL*
good
distance
from
me
,
and
lifting
my
hand
up
and
down
like
a
pump
*NL*
handle
,
that
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
think
we
are
looking
,
Master
Copperfield
,
--
I
should
say
,
*NL*
Mister
?
''
fawned
Uriah
.
``
Do
n't
you
find
Mr.
Wickfield
blooming
,
sir
?
*NL*
Years
do
n't
tell
much
in
our
firm
,
Master
Copperfield
,
except
in
raising
*NL*
up
the
umble
,
namely
,
mother
and
self
--
and
in
developing

''
he
added
as
*NL*
an
after-thought
,
``
the
beautiful
,
namely
Miss
Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jerked
himself
about
,
after
this
compliment
,
in
such
an
intolerable
*NL*
manner
,
that
my
aunt
,
who
had
sat
looking
straight
at
him
,
lost
all
*NL*
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deuce
take
the
man
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
sternly
,
``
what
's
he
about
?
Do
n't
be
*NL*
galvanic
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
returned
Uriah
;
``
I
'm
aware
you
're
*NL*
nervous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
you
,
sir
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
anything
but
appeased
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
presume
to
say
so
!
I
am
nothing
of
the
sort

If
you
're

*NL*

yourself

If
you
're
a

*NL*
Good
God

said
my
aunt
,
with
great
indignation
,
``
I
am
not
going
to
be
*NL*
serpentined
and
corkscrewed
out
of
my
senses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heep
was
rather
abashed
,
as
most
people
might
have
been
,
by
this
*NL*
explosion
;
which
derived
great
additional
force
from
the
indignant
*NL*
manner
in
which
my
aunt
afterwards
moved
in
her
chair
,
and
shook
her
*NL*
head
as
if
she
were
making
snaps
or
bounces
at
him
.
But
,
he
said
to
me
*NL*
aside
in
a
meek
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
well
aware

indeed
I
think
I
had
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
knowing
her
,
when
I
was
a
numble
clerk
,
before
you
did
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
-RRB-
,
and
it
's
only
natural
,
I
am
sure
,
that
it
should
be
made
*NL*
quicker
by
present
circumstances
.
The
wonder
is
,
that
it
is
n't
much
*NL*
worse
!
I
only
called
to
say
that
if
there
was
anything
we
could
do
,
in
*NL*
present
circumstances
,
mother
or
self
,
or
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
we
should
*NL*
be
really
glad
.
I
may
go
so
far
?
''
said
Uriah
,
with
a
sickly
smile
at
his
*NL*
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uriah
Heep
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
in
a
monotonous
forced
way
,
``
is
active
*NL*
in
the
business
,
Trotwood
.
What
he
says
,
I
quite
concur
in
.
You
know
I
*NL*
had
an
old
interest
in
you
.
Apart
from
that
,
what
Uriah
says
I
quite
*NL*
concur
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
reward
it
is
,
''
said
Uriah
,
drawing
up
one
leg
,
at
the
risk
*NL*
of
bringing
down
upon
himself
another
visitation
from
my
aunt
,
``
to
be
so
*NL*
trusted
in
!
But
I
hope
I
am
able
to
do
something
to
relieve
him
from
the
*NL*
fatigues
of
business
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uriah
Heep
is
a
great
relief
to
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
in
the
same
*NL*
dull
voice
.
``
It
's
a
load
off
my
mind
,
Trotwood
,
to
have
such
a
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
fox
made
him
say
all
this
,
I
knew
,
to
exhibit
him
to
me
in
the
*NL*
light
he
had
indicated
on
the
night
when
he
poisoned
my
rest
.
I
saw
the
*NL*
same
ill-favored
smile
upon
his
face
again
,
and
saw
how
he
watched
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
going
,
papa
?
''
said
Agnes
,
anxiously
.
``
Will
you
not
walk
*NL*
back
with
Trotwood
and
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
looked
to
Uriah
,
I
believe
,
before
replying
,
if
that
*NL*
worthy
had
not
anticipated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bespoke
myself
,
''
said
Uriah
,
``
on
business
;
otherwise
I
should
have
*NL*
been
appy
to
have
kept
with
my
friends
.
But
I
leave
my
partner
to
*NL*
represent
the
firm
.
Miss
Agnes
,
ever
yours
!
I
wish
you
good-day
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
,
and
leave
my
umble
respects
for
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
those
words
,
he
retired
,
kissing
his
great
hand
,
and
leering
at
us
*NL*
like
a
mask
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
there
,
talking
about
our
pleasant
old
Canterbury
days
,
an
hour
or
*NL*
two
.
Mr.
Wickfield
,
left
to
Agnes
,
soon
became
more
like
his
former
*NL*
self
;
though
there
was
a
settled
depression
upon
him
,
which
he
never
*NL*
shook
off
.
For
all
that
,
he
brightened
;
and
had
an
evident
pleasure
in
*NL*
hearing
us
recall
the
little
incidents
of
our
old
life
,
many
of
which
he
*NL*
remembered
very
well
.
He
said
it
was
like
those
times
,
to
be
alone
with
*NL*
Agnes
and
me
again
;
and
he
wished
to
Heaven
they
had
never
changed
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
there
was
an
influence
in
the
placid
face
of
Agnes
,
and
in
the
very
*NL*
touch
of
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
that
did
wonders
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
-LRB-
who
was
busy
nearly
all
this
while
with
Peggotty
,
in
the
inner
*NL*
room
-RRB-
would
not
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
they
were
staying
,
but
*NL*
insisted
on
my
going
;
and
I
went
.
We
dined
together
.
After
dinner
,
Agnes
*NL*
sat
beside
him
,
as
of
old
,
and
poured
out
his
wine
.
He
took
what
she
*NL*
gave
him
,
and
no
more
--
like
a
child
--
and
we
all
three
sat
together
at
a
*NL*
window
as
the
evening
gathered
in
.
When
it
was
almost
dark
,
he
lay
down
*NL*
on
a
sofa
,
Agnes
pillowing
his
head
and
bending
over
him
a
little
while
;
*NL*
and
when
she
came
back
to
the
window
,
it
was
not
so
dark
but
I
could
see
*NL*
tears
glittering
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pray
Heaven
that
I
never
may
forget
the
dear
girl
in
her
love
and
*NL*
truth
,
at
that
time
of
my
life
;
for
if
I
should
,
I
must
be
drawing
near
*NL*
the
end
,
and
then
I
would
desire
to
remember
her
best
!
She
filled
my
*NL*
heart
with
such
good
resolutions
,
strengthened
my
weakness
so
,
by
her
*NL*
example
,
so
directed
--
I
know
not
how
,
she
was
too
modest
and
gentle
to
*NL*
advise
me
in
many
words
--
the
wandering
ardor
and
unsettled
purpose
*NL*
within
me
,
that
all
the
little
good
I
have
done
,
and
all
the
harm
I
have
*NL*
forborne
,
I
solemnly
believe
I
may
refer
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
how
she
spoke
to
me
of
Dora
,
sitting
at
the
window
in
the
dark
;
*NL*
listened
to
my
praises
of
her
;
praised
again
;
and
round
the
little
*NL*
fairy-figure
shed
some
glimpses
of
her
own
pure
light
,
that
made
it
yet
*NL*
more
precious
and
more
innocent
to
me
!
Oh
,
Agnes
,
sister
of
my
boyhood
,
*NL*
if
I
had
known
then
,
what
I
knew
long
afterwards
!
--
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
beggar
in
the
street
,
when
I
went
down
;
and
as
I
turned
my
*NL*
head
towards
the
window
,
thinking
of
her
calm
,
seraphic
eyes
,
he
made
me
*NL*
start
by
muttering
,
as
if
he
were
an
echo
of
the
morning
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blind
!
Blind
!
Blind
!

CHAPTER
XXXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
ENTHUSIASM
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
the
next
day
with
another
dive
into
the
Roman
bath
,
and
then
*NL*
started
for
Highgate
.
I
was
not
dispirited
now
.
I
was
not
afraid
of
the
*NL*
shabby
coat
,
and
had
no
yearnings
after
gallant
greys
.
My
whole
manner
*NL*
of
thinking
of
our
late
misfortune
was
changed
.
What
I
had
to
do
,
was
,
*NL*
to
show
my
aunt
that
her
past
goodness
to
me
had
not
been
thrown
away
on
*NL*
an
insensible
,
ungrateful
object
.
What
I
had
to
do
,
was
,
to
turn
the
*NL*
painful
discipline
of
my
younger
days
to
account
,
by
going
to
work
with
*NL*
a
resolute
and
steady
heart
.
What
I
had
to
do
,
was
,
to
take
my
woodman
's
*NL*
axe
in
my
hand
,
and
clear
my
own
way
through
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
*NL*
by
cutting
down
the
trees
until
I
came
to
Dora
.
And
I
went
on
at
a
*NL*
mighty
rate
,
as
if
it
could
be
done
by
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
found
myself
on
the
familiar
Highgate
road
,
pursuing
such
a
*NL*
different
errand
from
that
old
one
of
pleasure
,
with
which
it
was
*NL*
associated
,
it
seemed
as
if
a
complete
change
had
come
on
my
whole
life
.
*NL*
But
that
did
not
discourage
me
.
With
the
new
life
,
came
new
purpose
,
new
*NL*
intention
.
Great
was
the
labor
;
priceless
the
reward
.
Dora
was
the
*NL*
reward
,
and
Dora
must
be
won
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
into
such
a
transport
,
that
I
felt
quite
sorry
my
coat
was
not
a
*NL*
little
shabby
already
.
I
wanted
to
be
cutting
at
those
trees
in
the
*NL*
forest
of
difficulty
,
under
circumstances
that
should
prove
my
strength
.
*NL*
I
had
a
good
mind
to
ask
an
old
man
,
in
wire
spectacles
,
who
was
*NL*
breaking
stones
upon
the
road
,
to
lend
me
his
hammer
for
a
little
while
,
*NL*
and
let
me
begin
to
beat
a
path
to
Dora
out
of
granite
.
I
stimulated
*NL*
myself
into
such
a
heat
,
and
got
so
out
of
breath
,
that
I
felt
as
if
I
*NL*
had
been
earning
I
do
n't
know
how
much
.
In
this
state
,
I
went
into
a
*NL*
cottage
that
I
saw
was
to
let
,
and
examined
it
narrowly
,
--
for
I
felt
it
*NL*
necessary
to
be
practical
.
It
would
do
for
me
and
Dora
admirably
:
with
a
*NL*
little
front
garden
for
Jip
to
run
about
in
,
and
bark
at
the
*NL*
tradespeople
through
the
railings
,
and
a
capital
room
up-stairs
for
my
*NL*
aunt
.
I
came
out
again
,
hotter
and
faster
than
ever
,
and
dashed
up
to
*NL*
Highgate
,
at
such
a
rate
that
I
was
there
an
hour
too
early
;
and
,
though
*NL*
I
had
not
been
,
should
have
been
obliged
to
stroll
about
to
cool
myself
,
*NL*
before
I
was
at
all
presentable
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
care
,
after
putting
myself
under
this
necessary
course
of
*NL*
preparation
,
was
to
find
the
Doctor
's
house
.
It
was
not
in
that
part
of
*NL*
Highgate
where
Mrs.
Steerforth
lived
,
but
quite
on
the
opposite
side
of
*NL*
the
little
town
.
When
I
had
made
this
discovery
,
I
went
back
,
in
an
*NL*
attraction
I
could
not
resist
,
to
a
lane
by
Mrs.
Steerforth
's
,
and
*NL*
looked
over
the
corner
of
the
garden
wall
.
His
room
was
shut
up
close
.
*NL*
The
conservatory
doors
were
standing
open
,
and
Rosa
Dartle
was
walking
,
*NL*
bareheaded
,
with
a
quick
,
impetuous
step
,
up
and
down
a
gravel
walk
on
*NL*
one
side
of
the
lawn
.
She
gave
me
the
idea
of
some
fierce
thing
,
that
*NL*
was
dragging
the
length
of
its
chain
to
and
fro
upon
a
beaten
track
,
and
*NL*
wearing
its
heart
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
softly
away
from
my
place
of
observation
,
and
avoiding
that
part
*NL*
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
wishing
I
had
not
gone
near
it
,
strolled
about
*NL*
until
it
was
ten
o'clock
.
The
church
with
the
slender
spire
,
that
stands
*NL*
on
the
top
of
the
hill
now
,
was
not
there
then
to
tell
me
the
time
.
An
*NL*
old
red-brick
mansion
,
used
as
a
school
,
was
in
its
place
;
and
a
fine
*NL*
old
house
it
must
have
been
to
go
to
school
at
,
as
I
recollect
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
approached
the
Doctor
's
cottage
--
a
pretty
old
place
,
on
which
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
expended
some
money
,
if
I
might
judge
from
the
*NL*
embellishments
and
repairs
that
had
the
look
of
being
just
completed
--
I
*NL*
saw
him
walking
in
the
garden
at
the
side
,
gaiters
and
all
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
never
left
off
walking
since
the
days
of
my
pupilage
.
He
had
his
old
*NL*
companions
about
him
,
too
;
for
there
were
plenty
of
high
trees
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
and
two
or
three
rooks
were
on
the
grass
,
looking
after
*NL*
him
,
as
if
they
had
been
written
to
about
him
by
the
Canterbury
rooks
,
*NL*
and
were
observing
him
closely
in
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
the
utter
hopelessness
of
attracting
his
attention
from
that
*NL*
distance
,
I
made
bold
to
open
the
gate
,
and
walk
after
him
,
so
as
to
*NL*
meet
him
when
he
should
turn
round
.
When
he
did
,
and
came
towards
me
,
he
*NL*
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
for
a
few
moments
,
evidently
without
thinking
*NL*
about
me
at
all
;
and
then
his
benevolent
face
expressed
extraordinary
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
he
took
me
by
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
the
Doctor
;
``
you
are
a
man
!
How
do
you
*NL*
do
?
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
My
dear
Copperfield
,
how
very
much
you
*NL*
have
improved
!
You
are
quite
--
yes
--
dear
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hoped
he
was
well
,
and
Mrs.
Strong
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
!
''
said
the
Doctor
;
``
Annie
's
quite
well
,
and
she
'll
be
*NL*
delighted
to
see
you
.
You
were
always
her
favorite
.
She
said
so
,
last
*NL*
night
,
when
I
showed
her
your
letter
.
And
--
yes
to
be
sure
--
you
recollect
*NL*
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
,
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
``
To
be
sure
.
_
He
's
_
pretty
well
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
come
home
,
sir
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
India
?
''
said
the
Doctor
.
``
Yes
.
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
could
n't
bear
the
*NL*
climate
,
my
dear
.
Mrs.
Markleham
--
you
have
not
forgotten
Mrs.
*NL*
Markleham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Forgotten
the
Old
Soldier
!
And
in
that
short
time
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Markleham
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
``
was
quite
vexed
about
him
,
poor
*NL*
thing
;
so
we
have
got
him
at
home
again
;
and
we
have
bought
him
a
little
*NL*
Patent
place
,
which
agrees
with
him
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
enough
of
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
to
suspect
from
this
account
that
it
*NL*
was
a
place
where
there
was
not
much
to
do
,
and
which
was
pretty
well
*NL*
paid
.
The
Doctor
,
walking
up
and
down
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
his
kind
face
turned
encouragingly
to
mine
,
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
in
reference
to
this
proposal
of
yours
.
It
's
*NL*
very
gratifying
and
agreeable
to
me
,
I
am
sure
;
but
do
n't
you
think
you
*NL*
could
do
better
?
You
achieved
distinction
,
you
know
,
when
you
were
with
*NL*
us
.
You
are
qualified
for
many
good
things
.
You
have
laid
a
foundation
*NL*
that
any
edifice
may
be
raised
upon
;
and
is
it
not
a
pity
that
you
*NL*
should
devote
the
spring-time
of
your
life
to
such
a
poor
pursuit
as
I
*NL*
can
offer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
became
very
glowing
again
,
and
,
expressing
myself
in
a
rhapsodical
*NL*
style
,
I
am
afraid
,
urged
my
request
strongly
;
reminding
the
Doctor
that
*NL*
I
had
already
a
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
returned
the
Doctor
,
``
that
's
true
.
Certainly
,
your
having
*NL*
a
profession
,
and
being
actually
engaged
in
studying
it
,
makes
a
*NL*
difference
.
But
,
my
good
young
friend
,
what
's
seventy
pounds
a-year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
doubles
our
income
,
Doctor
Strong
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
replied
the
Doctor
.
``
To
think
of
that
!
Not
that
I
mean
to
say
*NL*
it
's
rigidly
limited
to
seventy
pounds
a-year
,
because
I
have
always
*NL*
contemplated
making
any
young
friend
I
might
thus
employ
,
a
present
too
.
*NL*
Undoubtedly
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
still
walking
me
up
and
down
with
his
*NL*
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
``
I
have
always
taken
an
annual
present
into
*NL*
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
tutor
,
''
said
I
-LRB-
now
,
really
,
without
any
nonsense
-RRB-
,
``
to
whom
I
*NL*
owe
more
obligations
already
than
I
ever
can
acknowledge
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
interposed
the
Doctor
.
``
Pardon
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
take
such
time
as
I
have
,
and
that
is
my
mornings
and
*NL*
evenings
,
and
can
think
it
worth
seventy
pounds
a-year
,
you
will
do
me
*NL*
such
a
service
as
I
can
not
express
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
the
Doctor
,
innocently
.
``
To
think
that
so
little
should
*NL*
go
for
so
much
!
Dear
,
dear
!
And
when
you
can
do
better
,
you
will
?
On
*NL*
your
word
,
now
?
''
said
the
Doctor
,
--
which
he
had
always
made
a
very
grave
*NL*
appeal
to
the
honor
of
us
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
word
,
sir
!
''
I
returned
,
answering
in
our
old
school
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
be
it
so
!
''
said
the
Doctor
,
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
still
*NL*
keeping
his
hand
there
,
as
we
still
walked
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
shall
be
twenty
times
happier
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
with
a
little
--
I
*NL*
hope
innocent
--
flattery
,
``
if
my
employment
is
to
be
on
the
Dictionary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
stopped
,
smilingly
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
,
with
a
triumph
most
delightful
to
behold
,
as
if
I
had
*NL*
penetrated
to
the
profoundest
depths
of
mortal
sagacity
,
``
My
dear
young
*NL*
friend
,
you
have
hit
it
.
It
IS
the
Dictionary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
it
be
anything
else
!
His
pockets
were
as
full
of
it
as
his
*NL*
head
.
It
was
sticking
out
of
him
in
all
directions
.
He
told
me
that
*NL*
since
his
retirement
from
scholastic
life
,
he
had
been
advancing
with
it
*NL*
wonderfully
;
and
that
nothing
could
suit
him
better
than
the
proposed
*NL*
arrangements
for
morning
and
evening
work
,
as
it
was
his
custom
to
walk
*NL*
about
in
the
day-time
with
his
considering
cap
on
.
His
papers
were
in
a
*NL*
little
confusion
,
in
consequence
of
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
having
lately
*NL*
proffered
his
occasional
services
as
an
amanuensis
,
and
not
being
*NL*
accustomed
to
that
occupation
;
but
we
should
soon
put
right
what
was
*NL*
amiss
,
and
go
on
swimmingly
.
Afterwards
,
when
we
were
fairly
at
our
*NL*
work
,
I
found
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
's
efforts
more
troublesome
to
me
than
I
*NL*
had
expected
,
as
he
had
not
confined
himself
to
making
numerous
*NL*
mistakes
,
but
had
sketched
so
many
soldiers
,
and
ladies
'
heads
,
over
the
*NL*
Doctor
's
manuscript
,
that
I
often
became
involved
in
labyrinths
of
*NL*
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
was
quite
happy
in
the
prospect
of
our
going
to
work
together
*NL*
on
that
wonderful
performance
,
and
we
settled
to
begin
next
morning
at
*NL*
seven
o'clock
.
We
were
to
work
two
hours
every
morning
,
and
two
or
three
*NL*
hours
every
night
,
except
on
Saturdays
,
when
I
was
to
rest
.
On
Sundays
,
*NL*
of
course
,
I
was
to
rest
also
,
and
I
considered
these
very
easy
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
plans
being
thus
arranged
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
,
the
Doctor
*NL*
took
me
into
the
house
to
present
me
to
Mrs.
Strong
,
whom
we
found
in
*NL*
the
Doctor
's
new
study
,
dusting
his
books
,
--
a
freedom
which
he
never
*NL*
permitted
anybody
else
to
take
with
those
sacred
favorites
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
postponed
their
breakfast
on
my
account
,
and
we
sat
down
to
*NL*
table
together
.
We
had
not
been
seated
long
,
when
I
saw
an
approaching
*NL*
arrival
in
Mrs.
Strong
's
face
,
before
I
heard
any
sound
of
it
.
A
*NL*
gentleman
on
horseback
came
to
the
gate
,
and
,
leading
his
horse
into
the
*NL*
little
court
,
with
the
bridle
over
his
arm
,
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
,
*NL*
tied
him
to
a
ring
in
the
empty
coach-house
wall
,
and
came
into
the
*NL*
breakfast
parlor
,
whip
in
hand
.
It
was
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
;
and
Mr.
Jack
*NL*
Maldon
was
not
at
all
improved
by
India
,
I
thought
.
I
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
ferocious
virtue
,
however
,
as
to
young
men
who
were
not
cutting
down
the
*NL*
trees
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
;
and
my
impression
must
be
received
*NL*
with
due
allowance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jack
!
''
said
the
Doctor
,
``
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
shook
hands
with
me
;
but
not
very
warmly
,
I
believed
;
*NL*
and
with
an
air
of
languid
patronage
,
at
which
I
secretly
took
great
*NL*
umbrage
.
But
his
languor
altogether
was
quite
a
wonderful
sight
;
except
*NL*
when
he
addressed
himself
to
his
cousin
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
breakfasted
this
morning
,
Mr.
Jack
?
''
said
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
ever
take
breakfast
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
,
with
his
head
thrown
*NL*
back
in
an
easy
chair
.
``
I
find
it
bores
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
news
to-day
?
''
inquired
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
,
sir
,
''
replied
Mr.
Maldon
.
``
There
's
an
account
about
the
*NL*
people
being
hungry
and
discontented
down
in
the
North
,
but
they
are
*NL*
always
being
hungry
and
discontented
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
looked
grave
,
and
said
,
as
though
he
wished
to
change
the
*NL*
subject
,
``
Then
there
's
no
news
at
all
;
and
no
news
,
they
say
,
is
good
*NL*
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
long
statement
in
the
papers
,
sir
,
about
a
murder
,
''
observed
*NL*
Mr.
Maldon
.
``
But
somebody
is
always
being
murdered
,
and
I
did
n't
read
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
display
of
indifference
to
all
the
actions
and
passions
of
mankind
was
*NL*
not
supposed
to
be
such
a
distinguished
quality
at
that
time
,
I
think
,
*NL*
as
I
have
observed
it
to
be
considered
since
.
I
have
known
it
very
*NL*
fashionable
indeed
.
I
have
seen
it
displayed
with
such
success
,
that
I
*NL*
have
encountered
some
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
might
as
well
have
*NL*
been
born
caterpillars
.
Perhaps
it
impressed
me
the
more
then
,
because
*NL*
it
was
new
to
me
,
but
it
certainly
did
not
tend
to
exalt
my
opinion
of
,
*NL*
or
to
strengthen
my
confidence
in
,
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
out
to
inquire
whether
Annie
would
like
to
go
to
the
opera
*NL*
to-night
,
''
said
Mr.
Maldon
,
turning
to
her
.
``
It
's
the
last
good
night
*NL*
there
will
be
,
this
season
;
and
there
's
a
singer
there
,
whom
she
really
*NL*
ought
to
hear
.
She
is
perfectly
exquisite
.
Besides
which
,
she
is
so
*NL*
charmingly
ugly
,
''
relapsing
into
languor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
,
ever
pleased
with
what
was
likely
to
please
his
young
wife
,
*NL*
turned
to
her
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
go
,
Annie
.
You
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
not
,
''
she
said
to
the
Doctor
.
``
I
prefer
to
remain
at
*NL*
home
.
I
would
much
rather
remain
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
looking
at
her
cousin
,
she
then
addressed
me
,
and
asked
me
about
*NL*
Agnes
,
and
whether
she
should
see
her
,
and
whether
she
was
not
likely
to
*NL*
come
that
day
;
and
was
so
much
disturbed
,
that
I
wondered
how
even
the
*NL*
Doctor
,
buttering
his
toast
,
could
be
blind
to
what
was
so
obvious
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
saw
nothing
.
He
told
her
,
good-naturedly
,
that
she
was
young
and
*NL*
ought
to
be
amused
and
entertained
,
and
must
not
allow
herself
to
be
*NL*
made
dull
by
a
dull
old
fellow
.
Moreover
,
he
said
,
he
wanted
to
hear
her
*NL*
sing
all
the
new
singer
's
songs
to
him
;
and
how
could
she
do
that
well
,
*NL*
unless
she
went
?
So
the
Doctor
persisted
in
making
the
engagement
for
*NL*
her
,
and
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
was
to
come
back
to
dinner
.
This
concluded
,
he
*NL*
went
to
his
Patent
place
,
I
suppose
;
but
at
all
events
went
away
on
his
*NL*
horse
,
looking
very
idle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
curious
to
find
out
next
morning
,
whether
she
had
been
.
She
had
*NL*
not
,
but
had
sent
into
London
to
put
her
cousin
off
;
and
had
gone
out
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
to
see
Agnes
,
and
had
prevailed
upon
the
Doctor
to
go
with
*NL*
her
;
and
they
had
walked
home
by
the
fields
,
the
Doctor
told
me
,
the
*NL*
evening
being
delightful
.
I
wondered
then
,
whether
she
would
have
gone
*NL*
if
Agnes
had
not
been
in
town
,
and
whether
Agnes
had
some
good
influence
*NL*
over
her
too
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
look
very
happy
,
I
thought
;
but
it
was
a
good
face
,
or
a
*NL*
very
false
one
.
I
often
glanced
at
it
,
for
she
sat
in
the
window
all
the
*NL*
time
we
were
at
work
;
and
made
our
breakfast
,
which
we
took
by
snatches
*NL*
as
we
were
employed
.
When
I
left
,
at
nine
o'clock
,
she
was
kneeling
on
*NL*
the
ground
at
the
Doctor
's
feet
,
putting
on
his
shoes
and
gaiters
for
*NL*
him
.
There
was
a
softened
shade
upon
her
face
,
thrown
from
some
green
*NL*
leaves
overhanging
the
open
window
of
the
low
room
;
and
I
thought
all
*NL*
the
way
to
Doctors
'
Commons
,
of
the
night
when
I
had
seen
it
looking
at
*NL*
him
as
he
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
pretty
busy
now
;
up
at
five
in
the
morning
,
and
home
at
nine
or
*NL*
ten
at
night
.
But
I
had
infinite
satisfaction
in
being
so
closely
*NL*
engaged
,
and
never
walked
slowly
on
any
account
,
and
felt
*NL*
enthusiastically
that
the
more
I
tired
myself
,
the
more
I
was
doing
to
*NL*
deserve
Dora
.
I
had
not
revealed
myself
in
my
altered
character
to
Dora
*NL*
yet
,
because
she
was
coming
to
see
Miss
Mills
in
a
few
days
,
and
I
*NL*
deferred
all
I
had
to
tell
her
until
then
;
merely
informing
her
in
my
*NL*
letters
-LRB-
all
our
communications
were
secretly
forwarded
through
Miss
*NL*
Mills
-RRB-
,
that
I
had
much
to
tell
her
.
In
the
meantime
,
I
put
myself
on
a
*NL*
short
allowance
of
bear
's
grease
,
wholly
abandoned
scented
soap
and
*NL*
lavender
water
,
and
sold
off
three
waistcoats
at
a
prodigious
sacrifice
,
*NL*
as
being
too
luxurious
for
my
stern
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
satisfied
with
all
these
proceedings
,
but
burning
with
impatience
to
*NL*
do
something
more
,
I
went
to
see
Traddles
,
now
lodging
up
behind
the
*NL*
parapet
of
a
house
in
Castle
Street
,
Holborn
.
Mr.
Dick
,
who
had
been
*NL*
with
me
to
Highgate
twice
already
,
and
had
resumed
his
companionship
*NL*
with
the
Doctor
,
I
took
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
Mr.
Dick
with
me
,
because
,
acutely
sensitive
to
my
aunt
's
*NL*
reverses
,
and
sincerely
believing
that
no
galley-slave
or
convict
worked
*NL*
as
I
did
,
he
had
begun
to
fret
and
worry
himself
out
of
spirits
and
*NL*
appetite
,
as
having
nothing
useful
to
do
.
In
this
condition
,
he
felt
*NL*
more
incapable
of
finishing
the
Memorial
than
ever
;
and
the
harder
he
*NL*
worked
at
it
,
the
oftener
that
unlucky
head
of
King
Charles
the
First
*NL*
got
into
it
.
Seriously
apprehending
that
his
malady
would
increase
,
*NL*
unless
we
put
some
innocent
deception
upon
him
and
caused
him
to
believe
*NL*
that
he
was
useful
,
or
unless
we
could
put
him
in
the
way
of
being
*NL*
really
useful
-LRB-
which
would
be
better
-RRB-
,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
try
if
*NL*
Traddles
could
help
us
.
Before
we
went
,
I
wrote
Traddles
a
full
*NL*
statement
of
all
that
had
happened
,
and
Traddles
wrote
me
back
a
capital
*NL*
answer
,
expressive
of
his
sympathy
and
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
him
hard
at
work
with
his
inkstand
and
papers
,
refreshed
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
flowerpot-stand
and
the
little
round
table
in
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
small
apartment
.
He
received
us
cordially
,
and
made
friends
with
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
in
a
moment
.
Mr.
Dick
professed
an
absolute
certainty
of
having
*NL*
seen
him
before
,
and
we
both
said
,
``
Very
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
subject
on
which
I
had
to
consult
Traddles
was
this
.
--
I
had
*NL*
heard
that
many
men
distinguished
in
various
pursuits
had
begun
life
by
*NL*
reporting
the
debates
in
Parliament
.
Traddles
having
mentioned
*NL*
newspapers
to
me
,
as
one
of
his
hopes
,
I
had
put
the
two
things
*NL*
together
,
and
told
Traddles
in
my
letter
that
I
wished
to
know
how
I
*NL*
could
qualify
myself
for
this
pursuit
.
Traddles
now
informed
me
,
as
the
*NL*
result
of
his
inquiries
,
that
the
mere
mechanical
acquisition
necessary
,
*NL*
except
in
rare
cases
,
for
thorough
excellence
in
it
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
*NL*
perfect
and
entire
command
of
the
mystery
of
short-hand
writing
and
*NL*
reading
,
was
about
equal
in
difficulty
to
the
mastery
of
six
languages
;
*NL*
and
that
it
might
perhaps
be
attained
,
by
dint
of
perseverance
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
few
years
.
Traddles
reasonably
supposed
that
this
would
*NL*
settle
the
business
;
but
I
,
only
feeling
that
here
indeed
were
a
few
*NL*
tall
trees
to
be
hewn
down
,
immediately
resolved
to
work
my
way
on
to
*NL*
Dora
through
this
thicket
,
axe
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
my
dear
Traddles
!
''
said
I.
``
I
'll
begin
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
looked
astonished
,
as
he
well
might
;
but
he
had
no
notion
as
*NL*
yet
of
my
rapturous
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
buy
a
book
,
''
said
I
,
``
with
a
good
scheme
of
this
art
in
it
;
I
'll
*NL*
work
at
it
at
the
Commons
,
where
I
have
n't
half
enough
to
do
;
I
'll
take
*NL*
down
the
speeches
in
our
court
for
practice
--
Traddles
,
my
dear
fellow
,
*NL*
I
'll
master
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
''
said
Traddles
,
opening
his
eyes
,
``
I
had
no
idea
you
were
such
*NL*
a
determined
character
,
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
he
should
have
had
,
for
it
was
new
enough
to
me
.
I
*NL*
passed
that
off
,
and
brought
Mr.
Dick
on
the
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
wistfully
,
``
if
I
could
exert
myself
,
Mr.
*NL*
Traddles
--
if
I
could
beat
a
drum
--
or
blow
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
fellow
!
I
have
little
doubt
he
would
have
preferred
such
an
*NL*
employment
in
his
heart
to
all
others
.
Traddles
,
who
would
not
have
*NL*
smiled
for
the
world
,
replied
composedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
a
very
good
penman
,
sir
.
You
told
me
so
,
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
!
''
said
I.
And
indeed
he
was
.
He
wrote
with
extraordinary
*NL*
neatness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
you
could
copy
writings
,
sir
,
if
I
*NL*
got
them
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
looked
doubtfully
at
me
.
``
Eh
,
Trotwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
Mr.
Dick
shook
his
,
and
sighed
.
``
Tell
him
about
the
*NL*
Memorial
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
to
Traddles
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
keeping
King
*NL*
Charles
the
First
out
of
Mr.
Dick
's
manuscripts
;
Mr.
Dick
in
the
*NL*
meanwhile
looking
very
deferentially
and
seriously
at
Traddles
,
and
*NL*
sucking
his
thumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
these
writings
,
you
know
,
that
I
speak
of
,
are
already
drawn
up
and
*NL*
finished
,
''
said
Traddles
after
a
little
consideration
.
``
Mr.
Dick
has
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
Would
n't
that
make
a
difference
,
Copperfield
?
*NL*
At
all
events
would
n't
it
be
well
to
try
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
gave
us
new
hope
.
Traddles
and
I
laying
our
heads
together
apart
,
*NL*
while
Mr.
Dick
anxiously
watched
us
from
his
chair
,
we
concocted
a
*NL*
scheme
in
virtue
of
which
we
got
him
to
work
next
day
,
with
triumphant
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
table
by
the
window
in
Buckingham
Street
,
we
set
out
the
work
*NL*
Traddles
procured
for
him
--
which
was
to
make
,
I
forget
how
many
copies
*NL*
of
a
legal
document
about
some
right
of
way
--
and
on
another
table
we
*NL*
spread
the
last
unfinished
original
of
the
great
Memorial
.
Our
*NL*
instructions
to
Mr.
Dick
were
that
he
should
copy
exactly
what
he
had
*NL*
before
him
,
without
the
least
departure
from
the
original
;
and
that
when
*NL*
he
felt
it
necessary
to
make
the
slightest
allusion
to
King
Charles
the
*NL*
First
,
he
should
fly
to
the
Memorial
.
We
exhorted
him
to
be
resolute
in
*NL*
this
,
and
left
my
aunt
to
observe
him
.
My
aunt
reported
to
us
,
*NL*
afterwards
,
that
,
at
first
,
he
was
like
a
man
playing
the
kettle-drums
,
*NL*
and
constantly
divided
his
attentions
between
the
two
;
but
that
,
finding
*NL*
this
confuse
and
fatigue
him
,
and
having
his
copy
there
,
plainly
before
*NL*
his
eyes
,
he
soon
sat
at
it
in
an
orderly
business-like
manner
,
and
*NL*
postponed
the
Memorial
to
a
more
convenient
time
.
In
a
word
,
although
we
*NL*
took
great
care
that
he
should
have
no
more
to
do
than
was
good
for
him
,
*NL*
and
although
he
did
not
begin
with
the
beginning
of
a
week
,
he
earned
by
*NL*
the
following
Saturday
night
ten
shillings
and
nine
pence
;
and
never
,
*NL*
while
I
live
,
shall
I
forget
his
going
about
to
all
the
shops
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
to
change
this
treasure
into
sixpences
,
or
his
bringing
*NL*
them
to
my
aunt
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
heart
upon
a
waiter
,
with
*NL*
tears
of
joy
and
pride
in
his
eyes
.
He
was
like
one
under
the
propitious
*NL*
influence
of
a
charm
,
from
the
moment
of
his
being
usefully
employed
;
*NL*
and
if
there
were
a
happy
man
in
the
world
,
that
Saturday
night
,
it
was
*NL*
the
grateful
creature
who
thought
my
aunt
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
*NL*
existence
,
and
me
the
most
wonderful
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
starving
now
,
Trotwood
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
shaking
hands
with
me
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
``
I
'll
provide
for
her
,
sir
!
''
and
he
flourished
his
ten
fingers
*NL*
in
the
air
,
as
if
they
were
ten
banks
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
know
which
was
the
better
pleased
,
Traddles
or
I.
``
It
really
,
''
*NL*
said
Traddles
,
suddenly
,
taking
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
giving
*NL*
it
to
me
,
``
put
Mr.
Micawber
quite
out
of
my
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
-LRB-
Mr.
Micawber
never
missed
any
possible
opportunity
of
*NL*
writing
a
letter
-RRB-
was
addressed
to
me
,
``
By
the
kindness
of
T.
Traddles

Temple

It
ran
thus
:

I

mentioned
to
you
on
a

in
immediate
*NL*
connexion
with
one

Mrs.

Our

at
a

probably
be

commingled

attached
to

venerable

In

WILKINS

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
glad
to
find
that
Mr.
Micawber
had
got
rid
of
his
dust
and
ashes
,
*NL*
and
that
something
really
had
turned
up
at
last
.
Learning
from
Traddles
*NL*
that
the
invitation
referred
to
the
evening
then
wearing
away
,
I
*NL*
expressed
my
readiness
to
do
honor
to
it
;
and
we
went
off
together
to
*NL*
the
lodging
which
Mr.
Micawber
occupied
as
Mr.
Mortimer
,
and
which
was
*NL*
situated
near
the
top
of
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
resources
of
this
lodging
were
so
limited
,
that
we
found
the
twins
,
*NL*
now
some
eight
or
nine
years
old
,
reposing
in
a
turn-up
bedstead
*NL*
in
the
family
sitting-room
,
where
Mr.
Micawber
had
prepared
,
in
a
*NL*
wash-hand-stand
jug
,
what
he
called
``
a
Brew
''
of
the
agreeable
beverage
*NL*
for
which
he
was
famous
.
I
had
the
pleasure
,
on
this
occasion
,
of
*NL*
renewing
the
acquaintance
of
Master
Micawber
,
whom
I
found
a
promising
*NL*
boy
of
about
twelve
or
thirteen
,
very
subject
to
that
restlessness
of
*NL*
limb
which
is
not
an
unfrequent
phenomenon
in
youths
of
his
age
.
I
also
*NL*
became
once
more
known
to
his
sister
,
Miss
Micawber
,
in
whom
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
told
us
,
``
her
mother
renewed
her
youth
,
like
the
Phoenix
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield

''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
yourself
and
Mr.
Traddles
*NL*
find
us
on
the
brink
of
migration

and
will
excuse
any

discomforts
incidental
to
that
position
.

*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
round
as
I
made
a
suitable
reply
,
I
observed
that
the
family
*NL*
effects
were
already
packed
,
and
that
the
amount
of
luggage
was
by
no
*NL*
means
overwhelming

I
congratulated
Mrs.
Micawber
on
the
approaching
*NL*
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mrs.

appealed

feelingly
acquiesced

``

read
the

the

conclusion

derived

said
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

a

impatiently

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
aware

pursued
Mrs.

,
``
that

am

now
about

various
members
of
my
family

to
whom
Mr.
Micawber
has
written
in
the
*NL*
most
gentlemanly
terms
,
announcing
that
fact

have
not
taken
the
least
*NL*
notice
of
Mr.

communication

Indeed
I
may
be
superstitious

*NL*
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``

it
appears
to
me
that
Mr.

destined

never

majority
of

I
may
augur

from
the
silence
of
my

*NL*
that
they
object

I

not

I
expressed
my

this
was
going
in

right

said
Mrs.

``

,
of
Mrs.
Micawber
,
have
in
*NL*
a
great
measure
conduced
to
this
result
.
The
gauntlet
,
to
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
referred
upon
a
former
occasion
,
being
thrown
down
in
the
form
*NL*
of
an
advertisement
,
was
taken
up
by
my
friend
Heep
,
and
led
to
a
mutual
*NL*
recognition
.
Of
my
friend
Heep
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
who
is
a
man
of
*NL*
remarkable
shrewdness
,
I
desire
to
speak
with
all
possible
respect
.
My
*NL*
friend
Heep
has
not
fixed
the
positive
remuneration
at
too
high
a
*NL*
figure
,
but
he
has
made
a
great
deal
,
in
the
way
of
extrication
from
the
*NL*
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulties
,
contingent
on
the
value
of
my
*NL*
services
;
and
on
the
value
of
those
services
I
pin
my
faith
.
Such
*NL*
address
and
intelligence
as
I
chance
to
possess
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
boastfully
disparaging
himself
,
with
the
old
genteel
air
,
``
will
be
*NL*
devoted
to
my
friend
Heep
's
service
.
I
have
already
some
acquaintance
*NL*
with
the
law
--
as
a
defendant
on
civil
process
--
and
I
shall
immediately
*NL*
apply
myself
to
the
Commentaries
of
one
of
the
most
eminent
and
*NL*
remarkable
of
our
English
Jurists
.
I
believe
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
*NL*
that
I
allude
to
Mr.
Justice
Blackstone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
observations
,
and
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
observations
made
*NL*
that
evening
,
were
interrupted
by
Mrs.
Micawber
's
discovering
that
*NL*
Master
Micawber
was
sitting
on
his
boots
,
or
holding
his
head
on
with
*NL*
both
arms
as
if
he
felt
it
loose
,
or
accidentally
kicking
Traddles
under
*NL*
the
table
,
or
shuffling
his
feet
over
one
another
,
or
producing
them
at
*NL*
distances
from
himself
apparently
outrageous
to
nature
,
or
lying
*NL*
sideways
with
his
hair
among
the
wine-glasses
,
or
developing
his
*NL*
restlessness
of
limb
in
some
other
form
incompatible
with
the
general
*NL*
interests
of
society
;
and
by
Master
Micawber
's
receiving
those
*NL*
discoveries
in
a
resentful
spirit
.
I
sat
all
the
while
,
amazed
by
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
disclosure
,
and
wondering
what
it
meant
;
until
Mrs.
Micawber
*NL*
resumed
the
thread
of
the
discourse
,
and
claimed
my
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
particularly
request
Mr.
Micawber
to
be
careful
of
,
is
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
that
he
does
not
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
in
applying
*NL*
himself
to
this
subordinate
branch
of

law
,
place
it
out
of
his
power
*NL*
to
rise
,
ultimately
,
to
the
top
of
the
tree
.
I
am
convinced
that
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
,
giving
his
mind
to
a
profession
so
adapted
to
his
fertile
*NL*
resources
,
and
his
flow
of
language
,
_
must
_
distinguish
himself
.
Now
,
*NL*
for
example
,
Mr.
Traddles

said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
assuming
a
profound
air
,
*NL*
``
a
Judge
,
or
even

a
Chancellor

Does
an
individual
place
himself
*NL*
beyond
the
pale
of
those
preferments
by
entering
on
such
an
office
as
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
has
accepted
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear

''
observed
Mr.
Micawber
--
but
glancing
inquisitively
at
*NL*
Traddles
,
too
;
``
we
have
time
enough
before
us

for
the
consideration
of
*NL*
those
questions

*NL*
*NL*
``
Micawber

she
returned
,
``
no
!
Your
mistake
in
life
is
,
that
you
do
not
*NL*
look
forward
far
enough
.
You
are
bound

in
justice
to
your
family

which
your
abilities

lead
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
coughed
,
and
drank
his
punch
with
an
air
of
exceeding
*NL*
satisfaction
--
still
glancing
at
Traddles
,
as
if
he
desired
to
have
his
*NL*
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
plain
state
of
the
case
,
Mrs.
Micawber
,
''
said
Traddles
,
mildly
*NL*
breaking
the
truth
to
her
,
``
I
mean
the
real
prosaic
fact
,
you
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
my
dear
Mr.
Traddles
,
I
wish
to
be
as
*NL*
prosaic

literal
as
possible
on
a
subject
of
so
much
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Is
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
that

even
if
Mr.

Micawber
were
a
regular

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so

returned
Mrs.

Has
nothing

pursued
Traddles
,
``
to
do
with
that
.
Only
a

is
*NL*
eligible
for
such
preferments
;
and
Mr.

not
be
a

being
entered
at

as
a

,
for

five
years

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
with
her
most
affable
air
of
*NL*
business
.
``
Do
I
understand
,
my

that
,
at
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
be

returned
Traddles
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
*NL*
that
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,

said
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
That
is
quite
sufficient

If
such
is

the
case

Mr.

forfeits
no
privilege

entering
on
these
*NL*
duties
,
my
anxiety
is
set
at
rest

I
speak
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
as
a
*NL*
female
,
necessarily
;
but
I
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
Mr.

*NL*
possesses
what
I
have
heard
my
papa
call
,
when
I
lived
at
home
,
the
*NL*
judicial
mind
;
and
I
hope
Mr.
Micawber
is
now
entering
on
a
field
where
*NL*
that
mind
will
develope
itself
,
and
take
a
commanding
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
quite
believe
that
Mr.
Micawber
saw
himself
,
in
his
judicial
mind
's
*NL*
eye
,
on
the
woolsack
.
He
passed
his
hand
complacently
over
his
bald
*NL*
head
,
and
said
with
ostentatious
resignation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
we
will
not
anticipate
the
decrees
of
fortune
.
If
I
am
*NL*
reserved
to
wear
a

,
I
am
at
least
prepared
,
externally
,
''
in
allusion
*NL*
to
his
baldness
,
``
for
that
distinction
.
I
do
not
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
``
regret
my
hair
,
and
I
may
have
been
deprived
of
it
for
a
specific
*NL*
purpose
.
I
can
not
say
.
It
is
my
intention
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
to
*NL*
educate
my
son
for
the
Church
;
I
will
not
deny
that
I
should
be
happy
,
*NL*
on
his
account
,
to
attain
to
eminence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
Church

said
I
,
still
pondering
,
betweenwhiles
,
on
Uriah
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
.
``
He
has
a
remarkable
head-voice
,
and
will
*NL*
commence
as
a
chorister
.
Our
residence
at
Canterbury
,
and
our
local
*NL*
connexion
,
will
,
no
doubt
,
enable
him
to
take
advantage
of
any
vacancy
*NL*
that
may
arise
in
the
Cathedral
corps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
looking
at
Master
Micawber
again
,
I
saw
that
he
had
a
certain
*NL*
expression
of
face
,
as
if
his
voice
were
behind
his
eyebrows
;
where
it
*NL*
presently
appeared
to
be
,
on
his
singing
us
-LRB-
as
an
alternative
between
*NL*
that
and
bed
-RRB-
``
The
Wood-Pecker
tapping
.
''
After
many
compliments
on
this
*NL*
performance
,
we
fell
into
some
general
conversation
;
and
as
I
was
too
*NL*
full
of
my
desperate
intentions
to
keep
my
altered
circumstances
to
*NL*
myself
,
I
made
them
known
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
.
I
can
not
express
how
*NL*
extremely
delighted
they
both
were
,
by
the
idea
of
my
aunt
's
being
in
*NL*
difficulties
;
and
how
comfortable
and
friendly
it
made
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
nearly
come
to
the
last
round
of
the
punch
,
I
addressed
*NL*
myself
to
Traddles
,
and
reminded
him
that
we
must
not
separate
,
without
*NL*
wishing
our
friends
health
,
happiness
,
and
success
in
their
new
career
.
*NL*
I
begged
Mr.
Micawber
to
fill
us
bumpers
,
and
proposed
the
toast
in
due
*NL*
form
:
shaking
hands
with
him
across
the
table
,
and
kissing
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
to
commemorate
that
eventful
occasion
.
Traddles
imitated
me
in
*NL*
the
first
particular
,
but
did
not
consider
himself
a
sufficiently
old
*NL*
friend
to
venture
on
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
rising
with
one
of
his
thumbs
*NL*
in
each
of
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
``
the
companion
of
my
youth
:
if
I
*NL*
may
be
allowed
the
expression

my
esteemed
friend
Traddles
:
if
I
*NL*
may
be
permitted
to
call
him
so

will
allow
me
,
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
myself
,
and
our
offspring
,
to
thank
them
in
the
warmest
and
*NL*
most
uncompromising
terms
for
their
good
wishes
.
It
may
be
expected
*NL*
that
on
the
eve
of
a
migration
which
will
consign
us
to
a
perfectly
*NL*
new
existence
,
''
Mr.
Micawber
spoke
as
if
they
were
going
five
hundred
*NL*
thousand
miles
,
``
I
should
offer
a
few
valedictory
remarks
to
two
such
*NL*
friends

I
see
before
me
.
But
all
that
I
have
to
say
in
this
way
,
I
*NL*
have
said
.
Whatever
station
in
society
I
may
attain
,
through
the
medium
*NL*
of
the
learned
profession
of
which
I
am
about
to
become
an
unworthy
*NL*
member
,
I
shall
endeavour
not
to
disgrace
,
and
Mrs.
Micawber
will
be
*NL*
safe
to
adorn

Under
the
temporary
pressure
of
pecuniary
liabilities
,
*NL*
contracted
with
a
view
to
their
immediate
liquidation
,
but
remaining
*NL*
unliquidated
through
a
combination
of
circumstances
,
I
have
been
under
*NL*
the
necessity
of
assuming
a
garb
from
which
my
natural
instincts
*NL*
recoil
--
I
allude
to
spectacles
--
and
possessing
myself
of
a
cognomen
,
to
*NL*
which
I
can
establish
no
legitimate
pretensions

All
I
have
to
say
on
*NL*
that
score
is
,
that
the
cloud
has
passed
from
the
dreary
scene
,
and
the
*NL*
God
of
Day
is
once
more
high
upon
the
mountain
tops

On
Monday
next
,
on
*NL*
the
arrival
of
the
four
o'clock
afternoon
coach
at
Canterbury

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
resumed
his
seat
on
the
close
of
these
remarks
,
and
drank
*NL*
two
glasses
of
punch
in
grave
succession
.
He
then
said
with
much
*NL*
solemnity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
more
I
have
to
do

before
this

complete

*NL*
that
is
to
perform

*NL*
on
two
several

Mr.

left

me
say

in
short
,
in
the

The

the
second
has
not

arrived

The
amount
of
*NL*
the
first
obligation

here
Mr.

carefully
referred
to
papers
,
*NL*
``
was

I

twenty-three

four

amounting
to

forty-one

ten
,
eleven

My

will
perhaps
do
*NL*
me
the

*NL*
*NL*
I
did
so

found
it
correct

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

Mr.

prepared
for

once

erect

*NL*
*NL*
With
this
introduction
-LRB-
which
greatly
affected
him
-RRB-
,
Mr.
Micawber
placed
*NL*
his
I.
O.
U.
in
the
hands
of
Traddles
,
and
said
he
wished
him
well
in
*NL*
every
relation
of
life
.
I
am
persuaded
,
not
only
that
this
was
quite
the
*NL*
same
to
Mr.
Micawber
as
paying
the
money
,
but
that
Traddles
himself
*NL*
hardly
knew
the
difference
until
he
had
had
time
to
think
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
walked
so
erect
before
his
fellow
man
,
on
the
strength
of
*NL*
this
virtuous
action
,
that
his
chest
looked
half
as
broad
again
when
he
*NL*
lighted
us
down
stairs
.
We
parted
with
great
heartiness
on
both
sides
;
*NL*
and
when
I
had
seen
Traddles
to
his
own
door
,
and
was
going
home
alone
,
*NL*
I
thought
,
among
the
other
odd
and
contradictory
things
I
mused
upon
,
*NL*
that
,
slippery
as
Mr.
Micawber
was
,
I
was
probably
indebted
to
some
*NL*
compassionate
recollection
he
retained
of
me
as
his
boy-lodger
,
for
*NL*
never
having
been
asked
by
him
for
money
.
I
certainly
should
not
have
*NL*
had
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
it
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
knew
that
-LRB-
to
*NL*
his
credit
be
it
written
-RRB-
,
quite
as
well
as
I
did

CHAPTER
XXXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
LITTLE
COLD
WATER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
new
life
had
lasted
for
more
than
a
week
,
and
I
was
stronger
than
*NL*
ever
in
those
tremendous
practical
resolutions
that
I
felt
the
crisis
*NL*
required
.
I
continued
to
walk
extremely
fast
,
and
to
have
a
general
idea
*NL*
that
I
was
getting
on
.
I
made
it
a
rule
to
take
as
much
out
of
myself
as
*NL*
I
possibly
could
,
in
my
way
of
doing
everything
to
which
I
applied
my
*NL*
energies
.
I
made
a
perfect
victim
of
myself
.
I
even
entertained
some
*NL*
idea
of
putting
myself
on
a
vegetable
diet
,
vaguely
conceiving
that
,
in
*NL*
becoming
a
graminivorous
animal
,
I
should
sacrifice
to
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
yet
,
little
Dora
was
quite
unconscious
of
my
desperate
firmness
,
*NL*
otherwise
than
as
my
letters
darkly
shadowed
it
forth
.
But
,
another
*NL*
Saturday
came
,
and
on
that
Saturday
evening
she
was
to
be
at
Miss
*NL*
Mills
's
;
and
when
Mr.
Mills
had
gone
to
his
whist-club
-LRB-
telegraphed
to
*NL*
me
in
the
street
,
by
a
bird-cage
in
the
drawing-room
middle
window
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
was
to
go
there
to
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
we
were
quite
settled
down
in
Buckingham
Street
,
where
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
continued
his
copying
in
a
state
of
absolute
felicity
.
My
aunt
had
*NL*
obtained
a
signal
victory
over
Mrs.
Crupp
,
by
paying
her
off
,
throwing
*NL*
the
first
pitcher
she
planted
on
the
stairs
out
of
window
,
and
*NL*
protecting
in
person
,
up
and
down
the
staircase
,
a
supernumerary
whom
*NL*
she
engaged
from
the
outer
world
.
These
vigorous
measures
struck
such
*NL*
terror
to
the
breast
of
Mrs.
Crupp
,
that
she
subsided
into
her
own
*NL*
kitchen
,
under
the
impression
that
my
aunt
was
mad
.
My
aunt
being
*NL*
supremely
indifferent
to
Mrs.
Crupp
's
opinion
and
everybody
else
's
,
and
*NL*
rather
favoring
than
discouraging
the
idea
,
Mrs.
Crupp
,
of
late
the
*NL*
bold
,
became
within
a
few
days
so
faint-hearted
,
that
rather
than
*NL*
encounter
my
aunt
upon
the
staircase
,
she
would
endeavour
to
hide
her
*NL*
portly
form
behind
doors
--
leaving
visible
,
however
,
a
wide
margin
of
*NL*
flannel
petticoat
--
or
would
shrink
into
dark
corners
.
This
gave
my
aunt
*NL*
such
unspeakable
satisfaction
,
that
I
believe
she
took
a
delight
in
*NL*
prowling
up
and
down
,
with
her
bonnet
insanely
perched
on
the
top
of
her
*NL*
head
,
at
times
when
Mrs.
Crupp
was
likely
to
be
in
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
being
uncommonly
neat
and
ingenious
,
made
so
many
little
*NL*
improvements
in
our
domestic
arrangements
,
that
I
seemed
to
be
richer
*NL*
instead
of
poorer
.
Among
the
rest
,
she
converted
the
pantry
into
a
*NL*
dressing-room
for
me
;
and
purchased
and
embellished
a
bedstead
for
my
*NL*
occupation
,
which
looked
as
like
a
bookcase
in
the
daytime
,
as
a
*NL*
bedstead
could
.
I
was
the
object
of
her
constant
solicitude
;
and
my
poor
*NL*
mother
herself
could
not
have
loved
me
better
,
or
studied
more
how
to
*NL*
make
me
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
had
considered
herself
highly
privileged
in
being
allowed
to
*NL*
participate
in
these
labors
;
and
,
although
she
still
retained
something
*NL*
of
her
old
sentiment
of
awe
in
reference
to
my
aunt
,
had
received
so
*NL*
many
marks
of
encouragement
and
confidence
,
that
they
were
the
best
*NL*
friends
possible
.
But
the
time
had
now
come
-LRB-
I
am
speaking
of
the
*NL*
Saturday
when
I
was
to
take
tea
at
Miss
Mills
's
-RRB-
when
it
was
necessary
*NL*
for
her
to
return
home
,
and
enter
on
the
discharge
of
the
duties
she
had
*NL*
undertaken
in
behalf
of
Ham
.
``
So
good
bye
,
Barkis
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
*NL*
take
care
of
yourself
!
I
am
sure
I
never
thought
I
could
be
sorry
to
*NL*
lose
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
Peggotty
to
the
coach-office
,
and
saw
her
off
.
She
cried
at
*NL*
parting
,
and
confided
her
brother
to
my
friendship
as
Ham
had
done
.
We
*NL*
had
heard
nothing
of
him
since
he
went
away
,
that
sunny
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
own
dear
Davy
,
''
said
Peggotty
,
``
if
,
while
you
're
a
*NL*
prentice
,
you
should
want
any
money
to
spend
;
or
if
,
when
you
're
out
of
*NL*
your
time
,
my
dear
,
you
should
want
any
to
set
you
up
-LRB-
and
you
must
do
*NL*
one
or
other
,
or
both
,
my
darling
-RRB-
;
who
has
such
a
good
right
to
ask
*NL*
leave
to
lend
it
you
,
as
my
sweet
girl
's
own
old
stupid
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
so
savagely
independent
as
to
say
anything
in
reply
,
but
that
*NL*
if
ever
I
borrowed
money
of
anyone
,
I
would
borrow
it
of
her
.
Next
to
*NL*
accepting
a
large
sum
on
the
spot
,
I
believe
this
gave
Peggotty
more
*NL*
comfort
than
anything
I
could
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
my
dear
!
''
whispered
Peggotty
,
``
tell
the
pretty
little
angel
that
I
*NL*
should
so
have
liked
to
see
her
,
only
for
a
minute
!
And
tell
her
that
*NL*
before
she
marries
my
boy
,
I
'll
come
and
make
your
house
so
beautiful
*NL*
for
you
,
if
you
'll
let
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
declared
that
nobody
else
should
touch
it
;
and
this
gave
Peggotty
such
*NL*
delight
that
she
went
away
in
good
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fatigued
myself
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
in
the
Commons
all
day
,
by
*NL*
a
variety
of
devices
,
and
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
evening
repaired
*NL*
to
Mr.
Mills
's
street
.
Mr.
Mills
,
who
was
a
terrible
fellow
to
fall
*NL*
asleep
after
dinner
,
had
not
yet
gone
out
,
and
there
was
no
birdcage
in
*NL*
the
middle
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
me
waiting
so
long
,
that
I
fervently
hoped
the
Club
would
fine
*NL*
him
for
being
late
.
At
last
he
came
out
;
and
then
I
saw
my
own
Dora
hang
*NL*
up
the
birdcage
,
and
peep
into
the
balcony
to
look
for
me
,
and
run
in
*NL*
again
when
she
saw
I
was
there
,
while
Jip
remained
behind
,
to
bark
*NL*
injuriously
at
an
immense
butcher
's
dog
in
the
street
,
who
could
have
*NL*
taken
him
like
a
pill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
came
to
the
drawing-room
door
to
meet
me
;
and
Jip
came
scrambling
*NL*
out
,
tumbling
over
his
own
growls
,
under
the
impression
that
I
was
a
*NL*
Bandit
;
and
we
all
three
went
in
,
as
happy
and
loving
as
could
be
.
I
*NL*
soon
carried
desolation
into
the
bosom
of
our
joys
--
not
that
I
meant
to
*NL*
do
it
,
but
that
I
was
so
full
of
the
subject
--
by
asking
Dora
,
without
*NL*
the
smallest
preparation
,
if
she
could
love
a
beggar
?
*NL*
*NL*
My
pretty
,
little
,
startled
Dora
!
Her
only
association
with
the
word
was
*NL*
a
yellow
face
and
a
nightcap
,
or
a
pair
of
crutches
,
or
a
wooden
leg
,
or
*NL*
a
dog
with
a
decanter-stand
in
his
mouth
,
or
something
of
that
kind
;
and
*NL*
she
stared
at
me
with
the
most
delightful
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
ask
me
anything
so
foolish
!
''
pouted
Dora
.
``
Love
a
beggar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dora
,
my
own
dearest
!
''
said
I.
''
_
I
_
am
a
beggar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
such
a
silly
thing
,
''
replied
Dora
,
slapping
my
hand
,
``
as
*NL*
to
sit
there
,
telling
such
stories
?
I
'll
make
Jip
bite
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
childish
way
was
the
most
delicious
way
in
the
world
to
me
,
but
it
*NL*
was
necessary
to
be
explicit
,
and
I
solemnly
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dora
,
my
own
life
,
I
am
your
ruined
David
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
I
'll
make
Jip
bite
you
!
''
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
curls
,
``
if
*NL*
you
are
so
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
looked
so
serious
,
that
Dora
left
off
shaking
her
curls
,
and
laid
*NL*
her
trembling
little
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
first
looked
scared
and
*NL*
anxious
,
then
began
to
cry
.
That
was
dreadful
.
I
fell
upon
my
knees
*NL*
before
the
sofa
,
caressing
her
,
and
imploring
her
not
to
rend
my
heart
;
*NL*
but
,
for
some
time
,
poor
little
Dora
did
nothing
but
exclaim
Oh
dear
!
oh
*NL*
dear
!
And
oh
,
she
was
so
frightened
!
And
where
was
Julia
Mills
!
And
oh
,
*NL*
take
her
to
Julia
Mills
,
and
go
away
,
please
!
until
I
was
almost
beside
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
after
an
agony
of
supplication
and
protestation
,
I
got
Dora
to
*NL*
look
at
me
,
with
a
horrified
expression
of
face
,
which
I
gradually
*NL*
soothed
until
it
was
only
loving
,
and
her
soft
,
pretty
cheek
was
lying
*NL*
against
mine
.
Then
I
told
her
,
with
my
arms
clasped
round
her
,
how
I
*NL*
loved
her
,
so
dearly
,
and
so
dearly
;
how
I
felt
it
right
to
offer
to
*NL*
release
her
from
her
engagement
,
because
now
I
was
poor
;
how
I
never
*NL*
could
bear
it
,
or
recover
it
,
if
I
lost
her
;
how
I
had
no
fears
of
*NL*
poverty
,
if
she
had
none
,
my
arm
being
nerved
and
my
heart
inspired
by
*NL*
her
;
how
I
was
already
working
with
a
courage
such
as
none
but
lovers
*NL*
knew
;
how
I
had
begun
to
be
practical
,
and
to
look
into
the
future
;
how
*NL*
a
crust
well
earned
was
sweeter
far
than
a
feast
inherited
;
and
much
*NL*
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
which
I
delivered
in
a
burst
of
passionate
*NL*
eloquence
quite
surprising
to
myself
,
though
I
had
been
thinking
about
*NL*
it
,
day
and
night
,
ever
since
my
aunt
had
astonished
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
heart
mine
still
,
dear
Dora
?
''
said
I
,
rapturously
,
for
I
knew
*NL*
by
her
clinging
to
me
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
cried
Dora
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
it
's
all
yours
.
Oh
,
do
n't
be
dreadful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
I
_
dreadful
!
To
Dora
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
about
being
poor
,
and
working
hard
!
''
said
Dora
,
nestling
*NL*
closer
to
me
.
``
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
love
,
''
said
I
,
``
the
crust
well-earned
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
but
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
any
more
about
crusts
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
``
And
Jip
must
have
a
mutton-chop
every-day
at
twelve
,
or
he
'll
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
charmed
with
her
childish
,
winning
way
.
I
fondly
explained
*NL*
to
Dora
that
Jip
should
have
his
mutton-chop
with
his
accustomed
*NL*
regularity
.
I
drew
a
picture
of
our
frugal
home
,
made
independent
by
*NL*
my
labor
--
sketching-in
the
little
house
I
had
seen
at
Highgate
,
and
my
*NL*
aunt
in
her
room
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
dreadful
now
,
Dora
?
''
said
I
,
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
''
cried
Dora
.
``
But
I
hope
your
aunt
will
keep
in
her
own
*NL*
room
a
good
deal
!
And
I
hope
she
's
not
a
scolding
old
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
were
possible
for
me
to
love
Dora
more
than
ever
,
I
am
sure
I
did
.
*NL*
But
I
felt
she
was
a
little
impracticable
.
It
damped
my
new-born
ardor
,
*NL*
to
find
that
ardor
so
difficult
of
communication
to
her
.
I
made
another
*NL*
trial
.
When
she
was
quite
herself
again
,
and
was
curling
Jip
's
ears
,
as
*NL*
he
lay
upon
her
lap
,
I
became
grave
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
!
May
I
mention
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
do
n't
be
practical
!
''
said
Dora
,
coaxingly
.
``
Because
it
*NL*
frightens
me
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweet
heart
!
''
I
returned
;
``
there
is
nothing
to
alarm
you
in
all
this
.
I
*NL*
want
you
to
think
of
it
quite
differently
.
I
want
to
make
it
nerve
you
,
*NL*
and
inspire
you
,
Dora
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
that
's
so
shocking
!
''
cried
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
no
.
Perseverance
and
strength
of
character
will
enable
us
to
*NL*
bear
much
worse
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
n't
got
any
strength
at
all
,
''
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
curls
.
*NL*
``
Have
I
,
Jip
?
Oh
,
do
kiss
Jip
,
and
be
agreeable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
resist
kissing
Jip
,
when
she
held
him
up
to
me
for
*NL*
that
purpose
,
putting
her
own
bright
,
rosy
little
mouth
into
kissing
*NL*
form
,
as
she
directed
the
operation
,
which
she
insisted
should
be
*NL*
performed
symmetrically
,
on
the
centre
of
his
nose
.
I
did
as
she
bade
*NL*
me
--
rewarding
myself
afterwards
for
my
obedience
--
and
she
charmed
me
*NL*
out
of
my
graver
character
for
I
do
n't
know
how
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Dora
,
my
beloved
!
''
said
I
,
at
last
resuming
it
;
``
I
was
going
to
*NL*
mention
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judge
of
the
Prerogative
Court
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
,
*NL*
to
see
her
fold
her
little
hands
and
hold
them
up
,
begging
and
praying
*NL*
me
not
to
be
dreadful
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
not
going
to
be
,
my
darling
!
''
I
assured
her
.
``
But
,
Dora
,
my
*NL*
love
,
if
you
will
sometimes
think
,
--
not
despondingly
,
you
know
;
far
from
*NL*
that
!
--
but
if
you
will
sometimes
think
--
just
to
encourage
yourself
--
that
*NL*
you
are
engaged
to
a
poor
man
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
do
n't
!
Pray
do
n't
!
''
cried
Dora
.
``
It
's
so
very
dreadful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
soul
,
not
at
all
!
''
said
I
,
cheerfully
.
``
If
you
will
sometimes
think
*NL*
of
that
,
and
look
about
now
and
then
at
your
papa
's
housekeeping
,
and
*NL*
endeavour
to
acquire
a
little
habit
--
of
accounts
,
for
instance
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
little
Dora
received
this
suggestion
with
something
that
was
half
a
*NL*
sob
and
half
a
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
It
will
be
so
useful
to
us
afterwards
,
''
I
went
on
.
``
And
if
you
would
*NL*
promise
me
to
read
a
little
--
a
little
Cookery
Book
that
I
would
send
*NL*
you
,
it
would
be
so
excellent
for
both
of
us
.
For
our
path
in
life
,
my
*NL*
Dora
,
''
said
I
,
warming
with
the
subject
,
``
is
stony
and
rugged
now
,
and
*NL*
it
rests
with
us
to
smooth
it
.
We
must
fight
our
way
onward
.
We
must
be
*NL*
brave
.
There
are
obstacles
to
be
met
,
and
we
must
meet
,
and
crush
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
on
at
a
great
rate
,
with
a
clenched
hand
,
and
a
most
*NL*
enthusiastic
countenance
;
but
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
proceed
.
*NL*
I
had
said
enough
.
I
had
done
it
again
.
Oh
,
she
was
so
frightened
!
*NL*
Oh
,
where
was
Julia
Mills
!
Oh
,
take
her
to
Julia
Mills
,
and
go
away
,
*NL*
please
!
So
that
,
in
short
,
I
was
quite
distracted
,
and
raved
about
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
killed
her
,
this
time
.
I
sprinkled
water
on
her
face
.
*NL*
I
went
down
on
my
knees
.
I
plucked
at
my
hair
.
I
denounced
myself
as
*NL*
a
remorseless
brute
and
a
ruthless
beast
.
I
implored
her
forgiveness
.
*NL*
I
besought
her
to
look
up
.
I
ravaged
Miss
Mills
's
work-box
for
a
*NL*
smelling-bottle
,
and
in
my
agony
of
mind
applied
an
ivory
needle-case
*NL*
instead
,
and
dropped
all
the
needles
over
Dora
.
I
shook
my
fists
at
*NL*
Jip
,
who
was
as
frantic
as
myself
.
I
did
every
wild
extravagance
that
*NL*
could
be
done
,
and
was
a
long
way
beyond
the
end
of
my
wits
when
Miss
*NL*
Mills
came
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
done
this
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Mills
,
succouring
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
''
_
I
_
,
Miss
Mills
!
_
I
_
have
done
it
!
Behold
the
*NL*
destroyer
!
''
--
or
words
to
that
effect
--
and
hid
my
face
from
the
light
,
in
*NL*
the
sofa
cushion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Miss
Mills
thought
it
was
a
quarrel
,
and
that
we
were
verging
*NL*
on
the
Desert
of
Sahara
;
but
she
soon
found
out
how
matters
stood
,
for
*NL*
my
dear
affectionate
little
Dora
,
embracing
her
,
began
exclaiming
that
I
*NL*
was
``
a
poor
laborer
;
''
and
then
cried
for
me
,
and
embraced
me
,
and
asked
*NL*
me
would
I
let
her
give
me
all
her
money
to
keep
,
and
then
fell
on
Miss
*NL*
Mills
's
neck
,
sobbing
as
if
her
tender
heart
were
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mills
must
have
been
born
to
be
a
blessing
to
us
.
She
ascertained
*NL*
from
me
in
a
few
words
what
it
was
all
about
,
comforted
Dora
,
and
*NL*
gradually
convinced
her
that
I
was
not
a
laborer
--
from
my
manner
of
*NL*
stating
the
case
I
believe
Dora
concluded
that
I
was
a
navigator
,
*NL*
and
went
balancing
myself
up
and
down
a
plank
all
day
with
a
*NL*
wheelbarrow
--
and
so
brought
us
together
in
peace
.
When
we
were
quite
*NL*
composed
,
and
Dora
had
gone
up-stairs
to
put
some
rose-water
to
her
*NL*
eyes
,
Miss
Mills
rang
for
tea
.
In
the
ensuing
interval
,
I
told
Miss
*NL*
Mills
that
she
was
evermore
my
friend
,
and
that
my
heart
must
cease
to
*NL*
vibrate
ere
I
could
forget
her
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
expounded
to
Miss
Mills
what
I
had
endeavoured
,
so
very
*NL*
unsuccessfully
,
to
expound
to
Dora
.
Miss
Mills
replied
,
on
general
*NL*
principles
,
that
the
Cottage
of
content
was
better
than
the
Palace
of
*NL*
cold
splendour
,
and
that
where
love
was
,
all
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
to
Miss
Mills
that
this
was
very
true
,
and
who
should
know
it
*NL*
better
than
I
,
who
loved
Dora
with
a
love
that
never
mortal
had
*NL*
experienced
yet
.
But
on
Miss
Mills
observing
,
with
despondency
,
that
it
*NL*
were
well
indeed
for
some
hearts
if
this
were
so
,
I
explained
that
I
*NL*
begged
leave
to
restrict
the
observation
to
mortals
of
the
masculine
*NL*
gender
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
put
it
to
Miss
Mills
,
to
say
whether
she
considered
that
there
*NL*
was
or
was
not
any
practical
merit
in
the
suggestion
I
had
been
anxious
*NL*
to
make
,
concerning
the
accounts
,
the
housekeeping
,
and
the
Cookery
*NL*
Book
?
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mills
,
after
some
consideration
,
thus
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
I
will
be
plain
with
you
.
Mental
suffering
and
trial
*NL*
supply
,
in
some
natures
,
the
place
of
years
,
and
I
will
be
as
plain
with
*NL*
you
as
if
I
were
a
Lady
Abbess
.
No
.
The
suggestion
is
not
appropriate
to
*NL*
our
Dora
.
Our
dearest
Dora
is
a
favorite
child
of
nature
.
She
is
a
thing
*NL*
of
light
,
and
airiness
,
and
joy
.
I
am
free
to
confess
that
if
it
could
*NL*
be
done
,
it
might
be
well
,
but
--
''
And
Miss
Mills
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
encouraged
by
this
closing
admission
on
the
part
of
Miss
Mills
to
*NL*
ask
her
,
whether
,
for
Dora
's
sake
,
if
she
had
any
opportunity
of
luring
*NL*
her
attention
to
such
preparations
for
an
earnest
life
,
she
would
avail
*NL*
herself
of
it
?
Miss
Mills
replied
in
the
affirmative
so
readily
,
that
I
*NL*
further
asked
her
if
she
would
take
charge
of
the
Cookery
Book
;
and
,
if
*NL*
she
ever
could
insinuate
it
upon
Dora
's
acceptance
,
without
frightening
*NL*
her
,
undertake
to
do
me
that
crowning
service
.
Miss
Mills
accepted
this
*NL*
trust
,
too
;
but
was
not
sanguine
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dora
returned
,
looking
such
a
lovely
little
creature
,
that
I
really
*NL*
doubted
whether
she
ought
to
be
troubled
with
anything
so
ordinary
.
And
*NL*
she
loved
me
so
much
,
and
was
so
captivating
-LRB-
particularly
when
she
made
*NL*
Jip
stand
on
his
hind
legs
for
toast
,
and
when
she
pretended
to
hold
*NL*
that
nose
of
his
against
the
hot
tea-pot
for
punishment
because
he
*NL*
would
n't
-RRB-
,
that
I
felt
like
a
sort
of
Monster
who
had
got
into
a
Fairy
's
*NL*
bower
,
when
I
thought
of
having
frightened
her
,
and
made
her
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
we
had
the
guitar
;
and
Dora
sang
those
same
dear
old
French
*NL*
songs
about
the
impossibility
of
ever
on
any
account
leaving
off
*NL*
dancing
,
La
ra
la
,
La
ra
la
,
until
I
felt
a
much
greater
Monster
than
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
only
one
check
to
our
pleasure
,
and
that
happened
a
little
while
*NL*
before
I
took
my
leave
,
when
,
Miss
Mills
chancing
to
make
some
allusion
*NL*
to
to-morrow
morning
,
I
unluckily
let
out
that
being
obliged
to
exert
*NL*
myself
now
,
I
got
up
at
five
o'clock
.
Whether
Dora
had
any
idea
that
I
*NL*
was
a
Private
Watchman
,
I
am
unable
to
say
;
but
it
made
a
great
*NL*
impression
on
her
,
and
she
neither
played
nor
sang
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
on
her
mind
when
I
bade
her
adieu
;
and
she
said
to
me
,
in
*NL*
her
pretty
coaxing
way
--
as
if
I
were
a
doll
,
I
used
to
think
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
n't
get
up
at
five
o'clock
,
you
naughty
boy
.
It
's
so
*NL*
nonsensical
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
have
work
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
do
it
!
''
returned
Dora
.
``
Why
should
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
say
to
that
sweet
little
surprised
face
,
otherwise
*NL*
than
lightly
and
playfully
,
that
we
must
work
,
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
How
ridiculous
!
''
cried
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
we
live
without
,
Dora
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
Any
how
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
think
she
had
quite
settled
the
question
,
and
gave
me
such
*NL*
a
triumphant
little
kiss
,
direct
from
her
innocent
heart
,
that
I
would
*NL*
hardly
have
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
her
answer
,
for
a
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
!
I
loved
her
,
and
I
went
on
loving
her
,
most
absorbingly
,
entirely
,
*NL*
and
completely
.
But
going
on
,
too
,
working
pretty
hard
,
and
busily
*NL*
keeping
red-hot
all
the
irons
I
now
had
in
the
fire
,
I
would
sit
*NL*
sometimes
of
a
night
,
opposite
my
aunt
,
thinking
how
I
had
frightened
*NL*
Dora
that
time
,
and
how
I
could
best
make
my
way
with
a
guitar-case
*NL*
through
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
until
I
used
to
fancy
that
my
head
was
*NL*
turning
quite
grey
.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
DISSOLUTION
OF
PARTNERSHIP
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
allow
my
resolution
,
with
respect
to
the
Parliamentary
*NL*
Debates
,
to
cool
.
It
was
one
of
the
irons
I
began
to
heat
immediately
,
*NL*
and
one
of
the
irons
I
kept
hot
,
and
hammered
at
,
with
a
perseverance
I
*NL*
may
honestly
admire
.
I
bought
an
approved
scheme
of
the
noble
art
and
*NL*
mystery
of
stenography
-LRB-
which
cost
me
ten
and
sixpence
-RRB-
;
and
plunged
*NL*
into
a
sea
of
perplexity
that
brought
me
,
in
a
few
weeks
,
to
the
*NL*
confines
of
distraction
.
The
changes
that
were
rung
upon
dots
,
which
in
*NL*
such
a
position
meant
such
a
thing
,
and
in
such
another
position
*NL*
something
else
,
entirely
different
;
the
wonderful
vagaries
that
were
*NL*
played
by
circles
;
the
unaccountable
consequences
that
resulted
from
*NL*
marks
like
flies
'
legs
;
the
tremendous
effects
of
a
curve
in
a
wrong
*NL*
place
;
not
only
troubled
my
waking
hours
,
but
reappeared
before
me
in
my
*NL*
sleep
.
When
I
had
groped
my
way
,
blindly
,
through
these
difficulties
,
*NL*
and
had
mastered
the
alphabet
,
which
was
an
Egyptian
Temple
in
itself
,
*NL*
there
then
appeared
a
procession
of
new
horrors
,
called
arbitrary
*NL*
characters
;
the
most
despotic
characters
I
have
ever
known
;
who
*NL*
insisted
,
for
instance
,
that
a
thing
like
the
beginning
of
a
cobweb
,
*NL*
meant
expectation
,
and
that
a
pen
and
ink
sky-rocket
stood
for
*NL*
disadvantageous
.
When
I
had
fixed
these
wretches
in
my
mind
,
I
found
*NL*
that
they
had
driven
everything
else
out
of
it
;
then
,
beginning
again
,
I
*NL*
forgot
them
;
while
I
was
picking
them
up
,
I
dropped
the
other
fragments
*NL*
of
the
system
;
in
short
,
it
was
almost
heart-breaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
quite
heart-breaking
,
but
for
Dora
,
who
was
the
stay
*NL*
and
anchor
of
my
tempest-driven
bark
.
Every
scratch
in
the
scheme
was
a
*NL*
gnarled
oak
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
and
I
went
on
cutting
them
*NL*
down
,
one
after
another
,
with
such
vigour
,
that
in
three
or
four
months
*NL*
I
was
in
a
condition
to
make
an
experiment
on
one
of
our
crack
speakers
*NL*
in
the
Commons
.
Shall
I
ever
forget
how
the
crack
speaker
walked
off
*NL*
from
me
before
I
began
,
and
left
my
imbecile
pencil
staggering
about
the
*NL*
paper
as
if
it
were
in
a
fit
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
would
not
do
,
it
was
quite
clear
.
I
was
flying
too
high
,
and
should
*NL*
never
get
on
,
so
.
I
resorted
to
Traddles
for
advice
;
who
suggested
that
*NL*
he
should
dictate
speeches
to
me
,
at
a
pace
,
and
with
occasional
*NL*
stoppages
,
adapted
to
my
weakness
.
Very
grateful
for
this
friendly
aid
,
*NL*
I
accepted
the
proposal
;
and
night
after
night
,
almost
every
night
,
for
*NL*
a
long
time
,
we
had
a
sort
of
private
Parliament
in
Buckingham
Street
,
*NL*
after
I
came
home
from
the
Doctor
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
like
to
see
such
a
Parliament
anywhere
else
!
My
aunt
and
Mr.
*NL*
Dick
represented
the
Government
or
the
Opposition
-LRB-
as
the
case
might
*NL*
be
-RRB-
,
and
Traddles
,
with
the
assistance
of
Enfield
's
Speaker
or
a
volume
*NL*
of
parliamentary
orations
,
thundered
astonishing
invectives
against
*NL*
them
.
Standing
by
the
table
,
with
his
finger
in
the
page
to
keep
the
*NL*
place
,
and
his
right
arm
flourishing

Traddles
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Pitt
,
Mr.
Fox
,
Mr.
Sheridan
,
Mr.
Burke
,
Lord
Castlereagh
,
Viscount
*NL*
Sidmouth
,
or
Mr.
Canning
,
would
work
himself
into
the
most
violent
*NL*
heats
,
and
deliver
the
most
withering
denunciations
of
the
profligacy
*NL*
and
corruption
of
my
aunt
and
Mr.
Dick
;
while
I
used
to
sit
,
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
,
with
my
note-book
on
my
knee
,
fagging
after
him
with
all
my
*NL*
might
and
main
.
The
inconsistency
and
recklessness
of
Traddles
were
not
*NL*
to
be
exceeded
by
any
real
politician
.
He
was
for
any
description
of
*NL*
policy
,
in
the
compass
of
a
week
;
and
nailed
all
sorts
of
colours
to
*NL*
every
denomination
of
mast
.
My
aunt
,
looking
very
like
an
immoveable
*NL*
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
would
occasionally
throw
in
an
interruption
*NL*
or
two
,
as
``
Hear
!
''
or
``
No
!
''
or
``
Oh
!
''
when
the
text
seemed
to
require
it
:
*NL*
which
was
always
a
signal
to
Mr.
Dick
-LRB-
a
perfect
country
gentleman
-RRB-
to
*NL*
follow
lustily
with
the
same
cry
.
But
Mr.
Dick
got
taxed
with
such
*NL*
things
in
the
course
of
his
Parliamentary
career
,
and
was
made
*NL*
responsible
for
such
awful
consequences
,
that
he
became
uncomfortable
in
*NL*
his
mind
sometimes
.
I
believe
he
actually
began
to
be
afraid
he
really
*NL*
had
been
doing
something
,
tending
to
the
annihilation
of
the
British
*NL*
constitution
,
and
the
ruin
of
the
country
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Often
and
often
we
pursued
these
debates
until
the
clock
pointed
to
*NL*
midnight
,
and
the
candles
were
burning
down
.
The
result
of
so
much
good
*NL*
practice
was
,
that
by-and-by
I
began
to
keep
pace
with
Traddles
pretty
*NL*
well
,
and
should
have
been
quite
triumphant
if
I
had
had
the
least
idea
*NL*
what
my
notes
were
about
.
But
,
as
to
reading
them
after
I
had
got
them
,
*NL*
I
might
as
well
have
copied
the
Chinese
inscriptions
on
an
immense
*NL*
collection
of
tea-chests
,
or
the
golden
characters
on
all
the
great
red
*NL*
and
green
bottles
in
the
chemists
'
shops
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
for
it
,
but
to
turn
back
and
begin
all
over
again
.
It
*NL*
was
very
hard
,
but
I
turned
back
,
though
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
began
*NL*
laboriously
and
methodically
to
plod
over
the
same
tedious
ground
at
a
*NL*
snail
's
pace
;
stopping
to
examine
minutely
every
speck
in
the
way
,
on
*NL*
all
sides
,
and
making
the
most
desperate
efforts
to
know
these
elusive
*NL*
characters
by
sight
wherever
I
met
them
.
I
was
always
punctual
at
the
*NL*
office
;
at
the
Doctor
's
too
:
and
I
really
did
work
,
as
the
common
*NL*
expression
is
,
like
a
cart-horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
I
went
to
the
Commons
as
usual
,
I
found
Mr.
Spenlow
in
the
*NL*
doorway
looking
extremely
grave
,
and
talking
to
himself
.
As
he
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
complaining
of
pains
in
his
head
--
he
had
naturally
a
short
*NL*
throat
,
and
I
do
seriously
believe
he
overstarched
himself
--
I
was
at
*NL*
first
alarmed
by
the
idea
that
he
was
not
quite
right
in
that
direction
;
*NL*
but
he
soon
relieved
my
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
returning
my
``
Good
morning
''
with
his
usual
affability
,
he
*NL*
looked
at
me
in
a
distant
,
ceremonious
manner
,
and
coldly
requested
me
*NL*
to
accompany
him
to
a
certain
coffee-house
,
which
,
in
those
days
,
had
a
*NL*
door
opening
into
the
Commons
,
just
within
the
little
archway
in
St.
*NL*
Paul
's
churchyard
.
I
complied
,
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
,
and
with
a
*NL*
warm
shooting
all
over
me
,
as
if
my
apprehensions
were
breaking
out
into
*NL*
buds
.
When
I
allowed
him
to
go
on
a
little
before
,
on
account
of
the
*NL*
narrowness
of
the
way
,
I
observed
that
he
carried
his
head
with
a
lofty
*NL*
air
that
was
particularly
unpromising
;
and
my
mind
misgave
me
that
he
*NL*
had
found
out
about
my
darling
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
not
guessed
this
,
on
the
way
to
the
coffee-house
,
I
could
*NL*
hardly
have
failed
to
know
what
was
the
matter
when
I
followed
him
into
*NL*
an
up-stairs
room
,
and
found
Miss
Murdstone
there
,
supported
by
a
*NL*
background
of
sideboard
,
on
which
were
several
inverted
tumblers
*NL*
sustaining
lemons
,
and
two
of
those
extraordinary
boxes
,
all
corners
and
*NL*
flutings
,
for
sticking
knives
and
forks
in
,
which
,
happily
for
mankind
,
*NL*
are
now
obsolete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
gave
me
her
chilly
finger-nails
,
and
sat
severely
rigid
.
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
shut
the
door
,
motioned
me
to
a
chair
,
and
stood
on
the
*NL*
hearth-rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
the
goodness
to
show
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
``
what
you
*NL*
have
in
your
reticule
,
Miss
Murdstone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
it
was
the
old
identical
steel-clasped
reticule
of
my
*NL*
childhood
,
that
shut
up
like
a
bite
.
Compressing
her
lips
,
in
sympathy
*NL*
with
the
snap
,
Miss
Murdstone
opened
it
--
opening
her
mouth
a
little
at
*NL*
the
same
time
--
and
produced
my
last
letter
to
Dora
,
teeming
with
*NL*
expressions
of
devoted
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
is
your
writing
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
hot
,
and
the
voice
I
heard
was
very
unlike
mine
,
when
I
said
,
*NL*
``
It
is
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
not
mistaken
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
as
Miss
Murdstone
brought
a
*NL*
parcel
of
letters
out
of
her
reticule
,
tied
round
with
the
dearest
bit
*NL*
of
blue
ribbon
,
``
those
are
also
from
your
pen
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
them
from
her
with
a
most
desolate
sensation
;
and
,
glancing
at
*NL*
such
phrases
at
the
top
,
as
``
My
ever
dearest
and
own
Dora
,
''
``
My
best
*NL*
beloved
angel
,
''
``
My
blessed
one
for
ever
,
''
and
the
like
,
blushed
deeply
,
*NL*
and
inclined
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
!
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
coldly
,
as
I
mechanically
offered
them
*NL*
back
to
him
.
``
I
will
not
deprive
you
of
them
.
Miss
Murdstone
,
be
so
good
*NL*
as
to
proceed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
gentle
creature
,
after
a
moment
's
thoughtful
survey
of
the
carpet
,
*NL*
delivered
herself
with
much
dry
unction
as
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
to
having
entertained
my
suspicions
of
Miss
Spenlow
,
in
*NL*
reference
to
David
Copperfield
,
for
some
time
.
I
observed
Miss
Spenlow
*NL*
and
David
Copperfield
,
when
they
first
met
;
and
the
impression
made
upon
*NL*
me
then
was
not
agreeable
.
The
depravity
of
the
human
heart
is
such
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
oblige
me
,
ma'am
,
''
interrupted
Mr.
Spenlow
,
``
by
confining
*NL*
yourself
to
facts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
cast
down
her
eyes
,
shook
her
head
as
if
protesting
*NL*
against
this
unseemly
interruption
,
and
with
frowning
dignity
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
I
am
to
confine
myself
to
facts
,
I
will
state
them
as
dryly
as
I
*NL*
can
.
Perhaps
that
will
be
considered
an
acceptable
course
of
proceeding
.
*NL*
I
have
already
said
,
sir
,
that
I
have
had
my
suspicions
of
Miss
Spenlow
,
*NL*
in
reference
to
David
Copperfield
,
for
some
time
.
I
have
frequently
*NL*
endeavoured
to
find
decisive
corroboration
of
those
suspicions
,
but
*NL*
without
effect
.
I
have
therefore
forborne
to
mention
them
to
Miss
*NL*
Spenlow
's
father
;
''
looking
severely
at
him
;
``
knowing
how
little
*NL*
disposition
there
usually
is
in
such
cases
,
to
acknowledge
the
*NL*
conscientious
discharge
of
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
seemed
quite
cowed
by
the
gentlemanly
sternness
of
Miss
*NL*
Murdstone
's
manner
,
and
deprecated
her
severity
with
a
conciliatory
*NL*
little
wave
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
return
to
Norwood
,
after
the
period
of
absence
occasioned
by
my
*NL*
brother
's
marriage

pursued
Miss
Murdstone
in
a
disdainful
voice
,
``
and
*NL*
on
the
return
of
Miss
Spenlow
from
her
visit
to
her
friend
Miss
Mills
,
I
*NL*
imagined
that
the
manner
of
Miss
Spenlow
gave
me
greater
occasion
for
*NL*
suspicion
than
before
.
Therefore
I
watched
Miss
Spenlow
closely
.

*NL*
*NL*
Dear

tender
little
Dora

so
unconscious

``
Still
,
''
resumed
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
I
found
no
proof
until
last
night
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
me
that
Miss
Spenlow
received
too
many
letters
from
her

friend
Miss
Mills

another
telling
blow
at
Mr.
Spenlow
,
``
it
was
not

depravity

at

I
may
--
I
must

be
permitted

so
*NL*
far

refer

misplaced
confidence

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Spenlow
apologetically
murmured
his
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
evening
after
tea
,

pursued
Miss
Murdstone
,
``
I
observed
the
little
*NL*
dog
starting

rolling

growling
about
the
drawing-room

worrying

something

I
said
to
Miss
Spenlow
,

Dora
,
what
is
that
the
dog
has
in
*NL*
his
mouth

It

paper

Miss
Spenlow
immediately
put
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
frock
,
gave
a
sudden
cry
,
and
ran
to
the
dog

I
interposed
,

said

`
Dora
my
love

you
must
permit
me
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
Jip

miserable
Spaniel

this
wretchedness
,
then
,
was
your
work
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Spenlow
endeavoured

said
Miss
Murdstone
``
to
bribe
me
with
kisses

*NL*
work-boxes

and
small
articles

jewellery

that
,
of
course

I
pass
*NL*
over
.
The
little
dog
retreated
under
the
sofa
on
my
approaching
him
,
and
*NL*
was
with
great
difficulty
dislodged
by
the
fire-irons

Even
when
*NL*
dislodged
,
he
still
kept
the
letter

on
my
endeavouring

take
it
from
him
,
at
the
imminent
risk

being
bitten

he
kept
it

between

so
pertinaciously
as
to
suffer
himself
to
be
held
*NL*
suspended
in
the
air
by
means
of
the
document

At
length
I
obtained
*NL*
possession
of
it

After
perusing
it

I
taxed
Miss
Spenlow
with
having
*NL*
many
such
letters

ultimately
obtained

Here
she
ceased

snapping

again

shutting

looked

might
be
broken

could
never

``

The
picture
I
had
before
me

of
the
beautiful
little
treasure
of
my

heart

sobbing

crying
all
night

being
alone

frightened

wretched

if
you
do
,
sir
?
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
stopping
*NL*
short
upon
the
hearth-rug
.
``
Have
you
considered
your
years
,
and
my
*NL*
daughter
's
years
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
Have
you
considered
what
it
is
to
*NL*
undermine
the
confidence
that
should
subsist
between
my
daughter
and
*NL*
myself
?
Have
you
considered
my
daughter
's
station
in
life
,
the
projects
*NL*
I
may
contemplate
for
her
advancement
,
the
testamentary
intentions
I
may
*NL*
have
with
reference
to
her
?
Have
you
considered
anything
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
little
,
sir
,
I
am
afraid
;
''
I
answered
,
speaking
to
him
as
*NL*
respectfully
and
sorrowfully
as
I
felt
;
``
but
pray
believe
me
,
I
have
*NL*
considered
my
own
worldly
position
.
When
I
explained
it
to
you
,
we
were
*NL*
already
engaged
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
BEG
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
more
like
Punch
than
I
had
ever
seen
him
,
as
*NL*
he
energetically
struck
one
hand
upon
the
other
--
I
could
not
help
*NL*
noticing
that
even
in
my
despair
;
``
that
you
will
NOT
talk
to
me
of
*NL*
engagements
,
Mr.
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
otherwise
immoveable
Miss
Murdstone
laughed
contemptuously
in
one
*NL*
short
syllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
explained
my
altered
position
to
you
,
sir
,
''
I
began
again
,
*NL*
substituting
a
new
form
of
expression
for
what
was
so
unpalatable
to
*NL*
him
,
``
this
concealment
,
into
which
I
am
so
unhappy
as
to
have
led
Miss
*NL*
Spenlow
,
had
begun
.
Since
I
have
been
in
that
altered
position
,
I
have
*NL*
strained
every
nerve
,
I
have
exerted
every
energy
,
to
improve
it
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
shall
improve
it
in
time
.
Will
you
grant
me
time
--
any
length
of
*NL*
time
?
We
are
both
so
young
,
sir
,
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
interrupted
Mr.
Spenlow
,
nodding
his
head
a
great
many
*NL*
times
,
and
frowning
very
much
,
``
you
are
both
very
young
.
It
's
all
*NL*
nonsense
.
Let
there
be
an
end
of
the
nonsense
.
Take
away
those
letters
,
*NL*
and
throw
them
in
the
fire
.
Give
me
Miss
Spenlow
's
letters
to
throw
in
*NL*
the
fire
;
and
although
our
future
intercourse
must
,
you
are
aware
,
be
*NL*
restricted
to
the
Commons
here
,
we
will
agree
to
make
no
further
mention
*NL*
of
the
past
.
Come
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
you
do
n't
want
sense
;
and
this
is
*NL*
the
sensible
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
I
could
n't
think
of
agreeing
to
it
.
I
was
very
sorry
,
but
there
was
*NL*
a
higher
consideration
than
sense
.
Love
was
above
all
earthly
*NL*
considerations
,
and
I
loved
Dora
to
idolatry
,
and
Dora
loved
me
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
exactly
say
so
;
I
softened
it
down
as
much
as
I
could
;
but
I
*NL*
implied
it
,
and
I
was
resolute
upon
it
.
I
do
n't
think
I
made
myself
very
*NL*
ridiculous
,
but
I
know
I
was
resolute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
``
I
must
try
my
influence
*NL*
with
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
,
by
an
expressive
sound
,
a
long
drawn
respiration
,
which
*NL*
was
neither
a
sigh
nor
a
moan
,
but
was
like
both
,
gave
it
as
her
opinion
*NL*
that
he
should
have
done
this
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
try
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
confirmed
by
this
support
,
``
my
influence
*NL*
with
my
daughter
.
Do
you
decline
to
take
those
letters
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
?
''
For
I
had
laid
them
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
I
told
him
I
hoped
he
would
not
think
it
wrong
,
but
I
could
n't
*NL*
possibly
take
them
from
Miss
Murdstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
from
me
?
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
I
replied
with
the
profoundest
respect
;
nor
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
succeeding
,
I
was
undecided
whether
to
go
or
stay
.
At
length
I
*NL*
was
moving
quietly
towards
the
door
,
with
the
intention
of
saying
that
*NL*
perhaps
I
should
consult
his
feelings
best
by
withdrawing
:
when
he
said
,
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
,
into
which
it
was
as
much
as
he
*NL*
could
do
to
get
them
;
and
with
what
I
should
call
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
*NL*
decidedly
pious
air
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
probably
aware
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
that
I
am
not
altogether
*NL*
destitute
of
worldly
possessions
,
and
that
my
daughter
is
my
nearest
and
*NL*
dearest
relative
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hurriedly
made
him
a
reply
to
the
effect
,
that
I
hoped
the
error
into
*NL*
which
I
had
been
betrayed
by
the
desperate
nature
of
my
love
,
did
not
*NL*
induce
him
to
think
me
mercenary
too
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
allude
to
the
matter
in
that
light
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
.
``
It
*NL*
would
be
better
for
yourself
,
and
all
of
us
,
if
you
_
were
_
mercenary
,
*NL*
Mr.
Copperfield
--
I
mean
,
if
you
were
more
discreet
and
less
influenced
*NL*
by
all
this
youthful
nonsense
.
No
.
I
merely
say
,
with
quite
another
*NL*
view
,
you
are
probably
aware
I
have
some
property
to
bequeath
to
my
*NL*
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
certainly
supposed
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
can
hardly
think
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
``
having
experience
of
what
*NL*
we
see
,
in
the
Commons
here
,
every
day
,
of
the
various
unaccountable
and
*NL*
negligent
proceedings
of
men
,
in
respect
of
their
testamentary
*NL*
arrangements
--
of
all
subjects
,
the
one
on
which
perhaps
the
strangest
*NL*
revelations
of
human
inconsistency
are
to
be
met
with
--
but
that
mine
are
*NL*
made
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
inclined
my
head
in
acquiescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
allow
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
with
an
evident
increase
of
*NL*
pious
sentiment
,
and
slowly
shaking
his
head
as
he
poised
himself
upon
*NL*
his
toes
and
heels
alternately
,
``
my
suitable
provision
for
my
child
to
*NL*
be
influenced
by
a
piece
of
youthful
folly
like
the
present
.
It
is
mere
*NL*
folly
.
Mere
nonsense
.
In
a
little
while
,
it
will
weigh
lighter
than
any
*NL*
feather
.
But
I
might
--
I
might
--
if
this
silly
business
were
not
*NL*
completely
relinquished
altogether
,
be
induced
in
some
anxious
moment
to
*NL*
guard
her
from
,
and
surround
her
with
protections
against
,
the
*NL*
consequences
of
,
any
foolish
step
in
the
way
of
marriage
.
Now
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
I
hope
that
you
will
not
render
it
necessary
for
me
to
*NL*
open
,
even
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
that
closed
page
in
the
book
of
*NL*
life
,
and
unsettle
,
even
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
grave
affairs
long
*NL*
since
composed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
serenity
,
a
tranquillity
,
a
calm-sunset
air
about
him
,
which
*NL*
quite
affected
me
.
He
was
so
peaceful
and
resigned
--
clearly
had
his
*NL*
affairs
in
such
perfect
train
,
and
so
systematically
wound
up
--
that
he
*NL*
was
a
man
to
feel
touched
in
the
contemplation
of
.
I
really
think
I
saw
*NL*
tears
rise
to
his
eyes
,
from
the
depth
of
his
own
feeling
of
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
could
I
do
?
I
could
not
deny
Dora
and
my
own
heart
.
When
he
*NL*
told
me
I
had
better
take
a
week
to
consider
of
what
he
had
said
,
how
*NL*
could
I
say
I
would
n't
take
a
week
,
yet
how
could
I
fail
to
know
that
no
*NL*
amount
of
weeks
could
influence
such
love
as
mine
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meantime
,
confer
with
Miss
Trotwood
,
or
with
any
person
with
any
*NL*
knowledge
of
life
,
''
said
Mr.
Spenlow
,
adjusting
his
cravat
with
both
*NL*
hands
.
``
Take
a
week
,
Mr.
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
submitted
;
and
,
with
a
countenance
as
expressive
as
I
was
able
to
*NL*
make
it
of
dejected
and
despairing
constancy
,
came
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
Miss
Murdstone
's
heavy
eyebrows
followed
me
to
the
door
--
I
say
her
*NL*
eyebrows
rather
than
her
eyes
,
because
they
were
much
more
important
*NL*
in
her
face
--
and
she
looked
so
exactly
as
she
used
to
look
,
at
about
*NL*
that
hour
of
the
morning
,
in
our
parlour
at
Blunderstone
,
that
I
could
*NL*
have
fancied
I
had
been
breaking
down
in
my
lessons
again
,
and
that
*NL*
the
dead
weight
on
my
mind
was
that
horrible
old
spelling-book
,
with
*NL*
oval
woodcuts
,
shaped
,
to
my
youthful
fancy
,
like
the
glasses
out
of
*NL*
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
to
the
office
,
and
,
shutting
out
old
Tiffey
and
the
rest
of
*NL*
them
with
my
hands
,
sat
at
my
desk
,
in
my
own
particular
nook
,
thinking
*NL*
of
this
earthquake
that
had
taken
place
so
unexpectedly
,
and
in
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
my
spirit
cursing
Jip
,
I
fell
into
such
a
state
of
torment
*NL*
about
Dora
,
that
I
wonder
I
did
not
take
up
my
hat
and
rush
insanely
to
*NL*
Norwood
.
The
idea
of
their
frightening
her
,
and
making
her
cry
,
and
of
*NL*
my
not
being
there
to
comfort
her
,
was
so
excruciating
,
that
it
impelled
*NL*
me
to
write
a
wild
letter
to
Mr.
Spenlow
,
beseeching
him
not
to
visit
*NL*
upon
her
the
consequences
of
my
awful
destiny
.
I
implored
him
to
spare
*NL*
her
gentle
nature
--
not
to
crush
a
fragile
flower
--
and
addressed
him
*NL*
generally
,
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
,
as
if
,
instead
of
being
her
*NL*
father
,
he
had
been
an
Ogre
,
or
the
Dragon
of
Wantley
.
This
letter
I
*NL*
sealed
and
laid
upon
his
desk
before
he
returned
;
and
when
he
came
in
,
I
*NL*
saw
him
,
through
the
half-opened
door
of
his
room
,
take
it
up
and
read
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
nothing
about
it
all
the
morning
;
but
before
he
went
away
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
he
called
me
in
,
and
told
me
that
I
need
not
make
myself
at
*NL*
all
uneasy
about
his
daughter
's
happiness
.
He
had
assured
her
,
he
said
,
*NL*
that
it
was
all
nonsense
;
and
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
her
.
He
*NL*
believed
he
was
an
indulgent
father
-LRB-
as
indeed
he
was
-RRB-
,
and
I
might
*NL*
spare
myself
any
solicitude
on
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
make
it
necessary
,
if
you
are
foolish
or
obstinate
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
''
he
observed
,
``
for
me
to
send
my
daughter
abroad
again
,
for
*NL*
a
term
;
but
I
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
.
I
hope
you
will
be
wiser
*NL*
than
that
,
in
a
few
days
.
As
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
''
for
I
had
alluded
to
*NL*
her
in
the
letter
,
``
I
respect
that
lady
's
vigilance
,
and
feel
obliged
to
*NL*
her
;
but
she
has
strict
charge
to
avoid
the
subject
.
All
I
desire
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
is
,
that
it
should
be
forgotten
.
All
you
have
got
to
do
,
*NL*
Mr.
Copperfield
,
is
,
to
forget
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
!
In
the
note
I
wrote
to
Miss
Mills
,
I
bitterly
quoted
this
*NL*
sentiment
.
All
I
had
to
do
,
I
said
,
with
gloomy
sarcasm
,
was
to
forget
*NL*
Dora
.
That
was
all
,
and
what
was
that
!
I
entreated
Miss
Mills
to
see
me
,
*NL*
that
evening
.
If
it
could
not
be
done
with
Mr.
Mills
's
sanction
and
*NL*
concurrence
,
I
besought
a
clandestine
interview
in
the
back
kitchen
*NL*
where
the
Mangle
was
.
I
informed
her
that
my
reason
was
tottering
on
its
*NL*
throne
,
and
only
she
,
Miss
Mills
,
could
prevent
its
being
deposed
.
I
*NL*
signed
myself
,
hers
distractedly
;
and
I
could
n't
help
feeling
,
when
I
*NL*
read
this
composition
over
,
before
sending
it
by
a
porter
,
that
it
was
*NL*
something
in
the
style
of
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
sent
it
.
At
night
I
repaired
to
Miss
Mills
's
street
,
and
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
,
until
I
was
stealthily
fetched
in
by
Miss
Mills
's
*NL*
maid
,
and
taken
the
area
way
to
the
back
kitchen
.
I
have
since
seen
*NL*
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
my
going
in
*NL*
at
the
front
door
,
and
being
shown
up
into
the
drawing-room
,
except
Miss
*NL*
Mills
's
love
of
the
romantic
and
mysterious
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
back
kitchen
,
I
raved
as
became
me
.
I
went
there
,
I
suppose
,
to
*NL*
make
a
fool
of
myself
,
and
I
am
quite
sure
I
did
it
.
Miss
Mills
had
*NL*
received
a
hasty
note
from
Dora
,
telling
her
that
all
was
discovered
,
*NL*
and
saying
,
``
Oh
pray
come
to
me
,
Julia
,
do
,
do
!
''
But
Miss
Mills
,
*NL*
mistrusting
the
acceptability
of
her
presence
to
the
higher
powers
,
had
*NL*
not
yet
gone
;
and
we
were
all
benighted
in
the
Desert
of
Sahara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mills
had
a
wonderful
flow
of
words
,
and
liked
to
pour
them
out
.
I
*NL*
could
not
help
feeling
,
though
she
mingled
her
tears
with
mine
,
that
she
*NL*
had
a
dreadful
luxury
in
our
afflictions
.
She
petted
them
,
as
I
may
say
,
*NL*
and
made
the
most
of
them
.
A
deep
gulf
,
she
observed
,
had
opened
between
*NL*
Dora
and
me
,
and
Love
could
only
span
it
with
its
rainbow
.
Love
must
*NL*
suffer
in
this
stern
world
;
it
ever
had
been
so
,
it
ever
would
be
so
.
No
*NL*
matter
,
Miss
Mills
remarked
.
Hearts
confined
by
cobwebs
would
burst
at
*NL*
last
,
and
then
Love
was
avenged
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
small
consolation
,
but
Miss
Mills
would
n't
encourage
fallacious
*NL*
hopes
.
She
made
me
much
more
wretched
than
I
was
before
,
and
I
felt
-LRB-
and
*NL*
told
her
with
the
deepest
gratitude
-RRB-
that
she
was
indeed
a
friend
.
We
*NL*
resolved
that
she
should
go
to
Dora
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
find
some
means
of
assuring
her
,
either
by
looks
or
words
,
of
my
*NL*
devotion
and
misery
.
We
parted
,
overwhelmed
with
grief
;
and
I
think
Miss
*NL*
Mills
enjoyed
herself
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confided
all
to
my
aunt
when
I
got
home
;
and
in
spite
of
all
she
could
*NL*
say
to
me
,
went
to
bed
despairing
.
I
got
up
despairing
,
and
went
out
*NL*
despairing
.
It
was
Saturday
morning
,
and
I
went
straight
to
the
Commons
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
surprised
,
when
I
came
within
sight
of
our
office-door
,
to
see
the
*NL*
ticket-porters
standing
outside
talking
together
,
and
some
half
dozen
*NL*
stragglers
gazing
at
the
windows
which
were
shut
up
.
I
quickened
my
*NL*
pace
,
and
,
passing
among
them
,
wondering
at
their
looks
,
went
hurriedly
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerks
were
there
,
but
nobody
was
doing
anything
.
Old
Tiffey
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
in
his
life
I
should
think
,
was
sitting
on
somebody
*NL*
else
's
stool
,
and
had
not
hung
up
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
dreadful
calamity
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
he
,
as
I
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
?
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
?
''
cried
Tiffey
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
,
coming
round
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
I
,
looking
from
face
to
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Spenlow
,
''
said
Tiffey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
was
the
office
reeling
,
and
not
I
,
as
one
of
the
clerks
*NL*
caught
hold
of
me
.
They
sat
me
down
in
a
chair
,
untied
my
neckcloth
,
and
*NL*
brought
me
some
water
.
I
have
no
idea
whether
this
took
any
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
dined
in
town
yesterday
,
and
drove
down
in
the
phaeton
by
himself
,
''
*NL*
said
Tiffey
,
``
having
sent
his
own
groom
home
by
the
coach
,
as
he
*NL*
sometimes
did
,
you
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
phaeton
went
home
without
him
.
The
horses
stopped
at
the
stable
*NL*
gate
.
The
man
went
out
with
a
lantern
.
Nobody
in
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
they
run
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
not
hot
,
''
said
Tiffey
,
putting
on
his
glasses
;
``
no
hotter
,
I
*NL*
understand
,
than
they
would
have
been
,
going
down
at
the
usual
pace
.
The
*NL*
reins
were
broken
,
but
they
had
been
dragging
on
the
ground
.
The
house
*NL*
was
roused
up
directly
,
and
three
of
them
went
out
along
the
road
.
They
*NL*
found
him
a
mile
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
a
mile
off
,
Mr.
Tiffey
,
''
interposed
a
junior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
?
I
believe
you
are
right
,
''
said
Tiffey
,
--
''
_
more
_
than
a
mile
*NL*
off
--
not
far
from
the
church
--
lying
partly
on
the
road-side
,
and
partly
*NL*
on
the
path
,
upon
his
face
.
Whether
he
fell
out
in
a
fit
,
or
got
out
,
*NL*
feeling
ill
before
the
fit
came
on
--
or
even
whether
he
was
quite
dead
*NL*
then
,
though
there
is
no
doubt
he
was
quite
insensible
--
no
one
appears
*NL*
to
know
.
If
he
breathed
,
certainly
he
never
spoke
.
Medical
assistance
*NL*
was
got
as
soon
as
possible
,
but
it
was
quite
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
describe
the
state
of
mind
into
which
I
was
thrown
by
this
*NL*
intelligence
.
The
shock
of
such
an
event
happening
so
suddenly
,
and
*NL*
happening
to
one
with
whom
I
had
been
in
any
respect
at
variance
--
the
*NL*
appalling
vacancy
in
the
room
he
had
occupied
so
lately
,
where
his
chair
*NL*
and
table
seemed
to
wait
for
him
,
and
his
handwriting
of
yesterday
was
*NL*
like
a
ghost
--
the
indefinable
impossibility
of
separating
him
from
the
*NL*
place
,
and
feeling
,
when
the
door
opened
,
as
if
he
might
come
in
--
the
*NL*
lazy
hush
and
rest
there
was
in
the
office
,
and
the
insatiable
relish
*NL*
with
which
our
people
talked
about
it
,
and
other
people
came
in
and
out
*NL*
all
day
,
and
gorged
themselves
with
the
subject
--
this
is
easily
*NL*
intelligible
to
any
one
.
What
I
can
not
describe
is
,
how
,
in
the
*NL*
innermost
recesses
of
my
own
heart
,
I
had
a
lurking
jealousy
even
of
*NL*
Death
.
How
I
felt
as
if
its
might
would
push
me
from
my
ground
in
Dora
's
*NL*
thoughts
.
How
I
was
,
in
a
grudging
way
I
have
no
words
for
,
envious
of
*NL*
her
grief
.
How
it
made
me
restless
to
think
of
her
weeping
to
others
,
or
*NL*
being
consoled
by
others
.
How
I
had
a
grasping
,
avaricious
wish
to
shut
*NL*
out
everybody
from
her
but
myself
,
and
to
be
all
in
all
to
her
,
at
that
*NL*
unseasonable
time
of
all
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
trouble
of
this
state
of
mind
--
not
exclusively
my
own
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
but
known
to
others
--
I
went
down
to
Norwood
that
night
;
and
finding
from
*NL*
one
of
the
servants
,
when
I
made
my
inquiries
at
the
door
,
that
Miss
*NL*
Mills
was
there
,
got
my
aunt
to
direct
a
letter
to
her
,
which
I
wrote
.
I
*NL*
deplored
the
untimely
death
of
Mr.
Spenlow
most
sincerely
,
and
shed
*NL*
tears
in
doing
so
.
I
entreated
her
to
tell
Dora
,
if
Dora
were
in
a
state
*NL*
to
hear
it
,
that
he
had
spoken
to
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
*NL*
consideration
;
and
had
coupled
nothing
but
tenderness
,
not
a
single
or
*NL*
reproachful
word
,
with
her
name
.
I
know
I
did
this
selfishly
,
to
have
my
*NL*
name
brought
before
her
;
but
I
tried
to
believe
it
was
an
act
of
justice
*NL*
to
his
memory
.
Perhaps
I
did
believe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
received
a
few
lines
next
day
in
reply
;
addressed
,
outside
,
to
*NL*
her
;
within
,
to
me
.
Dora
was
overcome
by
grief
;
and
when
her
friend
had
*NL*
asked
her
should
she
send
her
love
to
me
,
had
only
cried
,
as
she
was
*NL*
always
crying
,
``
Oh
,
dear
papa
!
oh
,
poor
papa
!
''
But
she
had
not
said
No
,
*NL*
and
that
I
made
the
most
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jorkins
,
who
had
been
at
Norwood
since
the
occurrence
,
came
to
the
*NL*
office
a
few
days
afterwards
.
He
and
Tiffey
were
closeted
together
for
*NL*
some
few
moments
,
and
then
Tiffey
looked
out
at
the
door
and
beckoned
me
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mr.
Jorkins
.
``
Mr.
Tiffey
and
myself
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
are
*NL*
about
to
examine
the
desk
,
the
drawers
,
and
other
such
repositories
of
*NL*
the
deceased
,
with
the
view
of
sealing
up
his
private
papers
,
and
*NL*
searching
for
a
Will
.
There
is
no
trace
of
any
,
elsewhere
.
It
may
be
as
*NL*
well
for
you
to
assist
us
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
in
agony
to
obtain
some
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
*NL*
in
which
my
Dora
would
be
placed
--
as
,
in
whose
guardianship
,
and
so
*NL*
forth
--
and
this
was
something
towards
it
.
We
began
the
search
at
once
;
*NL*
Mr.
Jorkins
unlocking
the
drawers
and
desks
,
and
we
all
taking
out
the
*NL*
papers
.
The
office-papers
we
placed
on
one
side
,
and
the
private
papers
*NL*
-LRB-
which
were
not
numerous
-RRB-
on
the
other
.
We
were
very
grave
;
and
when
we
*NL*
came
to
a
stray
seal
,
or
pencil-case
,
or
ring
,
or
any
little
article
of
*NL*
that
kind
which
we
associated
personally
with
him
,
we
spoke
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
sealed
up
several
packets
;
and
were
still
going
on
dustily
and
*NL*
quietly
,
when
Mr.
Jorkins
said
to
us
,
applying
exactly
the
same
words
to
*NL*
his
late
partner
as
his
late
partner
had
applied
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Spenlow
was
very
difficult
to
move
from
the
beaten
track
.
You
know
*NL*
what
he
was
!
I
am
disposed
to
think
he
had
made
no
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
he
had
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
stopped
and
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
very
day
when
I
last
saw
him
,
''
said
I
,
``
he
told
me
that
he
had
,
*NL*
and
that
his
affairs
were
long
since
settled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jorkins
and
old
Tiffey
shook
their
heads
with
one
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
looks
unpromising
,
''
said
Tiffey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
unpromising
,
''
said
Mr.
Jorkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
do
n't
doubt
--
''
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
Mr.
Copperfield
!
''
said
Tiffey
,
laying
his
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
*NL*
shutting
up
both
his
eyes
as
he
shook
his
head
:
``
if
you
had
been
in
the
*NL*
Commons
as
long
as
I
have
,
you
would
know
that
there
is
no
subject
on
*NL*
which
men
are
so
inconsistent
,
and
so
little
to
be
trusted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
my
soul
,
he
made
that
very
remark
!
''
I
replied
persistently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
call
that
almost
final
,
''
observed
Tiffey
.
``
My
opinion
is
--
no
*NL*
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
a
wonderful
thing
to
me
,
but
it
turned
out
that
there
_
was
_
*NL*
no
will
.
He
had
never
so
much
as
thought
of
making
one
,
so
far
as
his
*NL*
papers
afforded
any
evidence
;
for
there
was
no
kind
of
hint
,
sketch
,
or
*NL*
memorandum
,
of
any
testamentary
intention
whatever
.
What
was
scarcely
*NL*
less
astonishing
to
me
,
was
,
that
his
affairs
were
in
a
most
disordered
*NL*
state
.
It
was
extremely
difficult
,
I
heard
,
to
make
out
what
he
owed
,
or
*NL*
what
he
had
paid
,
or
of
what
he
died
possessed
.
It
was
considered
likely
*NL*
that
for
years
he
could
have
had
no
clear
opinion
on
these
subjects
*NL*
himself
.
By
little
and
little
it
came
out
,
that
,
in
the
competition
on
*NL*
all
points
of
appearance
and
gentility
then
running
high
in
the
Commons
,
*NL*
he
had
spent
more
than
his
professional
income
,
which
was
not
a
very
*NL*
large
one
,
and
had
reduced
his
private
means
,
if
they
ever
had
been
*NL*
great
-LRB-
which
was
exceedingly
doubtful
-RRB-
,
to
a
very
low
ebb
indeed
.
There
*NL*
was
a
sale
of
the
furniture
and
lease
,
at
Norwood
;
and
Tiffey
told
me
,
*NL*
little
thinking
how
interested
I
was
in
the
story
,
that
,
paying
all
the
*NL*
just
debts
of
the
deceased
,
and
deducting
his
share
of
outstanding
bad
*NL*
and
doubtful
debts
due
to
the
firm
,
he
would
n't
give
a
thousand
pounds
*NL*
for
all
the
assets
remaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
at
the
expiration
of
about
six
weeks
.
I
had
suffered
tortures
*NL*
all
the
time
;
and
thought
I
really
must
have
laid
violent
hands
upon
*NL*
myself
,
when
Miss
Mills
still
reported
to
me
,
that
my
broken-hearted
*NL*
little
Dora
would
say
nothing
,
when
I
was
mentioned
,
but
``
Oh
,
poor
papa
!
*NL*
Oh
,
dear
papa
!
''
Also
,
that
she
had
no
other
relations
than
two
aunts
,
*NL*
maiden
sisters
of
Mr.
Spenlow
,
who
lived
at
Putney
,
and
who
had
not
held
*NL*
any
other
than
chance
communication
with
their
brother
for
many
years
.
*NL*
Not
that
they
had
ever
quarrelled
-LRB-
Miss
Mills
informed
me
-RRB-
;
but
that
*NL*
having
been
,
on
the
occasion
of
Dora
's
christening
,
invited
to
tea
,
when
*NL*
they
considered
themselves
privileged
to
be
invited
to
dinner
,
they
had
*NL*
expressed
their
opinion
in
writing
,
that
it
was
``
better
for
the
*NL*
happiness
of
all
parties
''
that
they
should
stay
away
.
Since
which
they
*NL*
had
gone
their
road
,
and
their
brother
had
gone
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
ladies
now
emerged
from
their
retirement
,
and
proposed
to
take
*NL*
Dora
to
live
at
Putney
.
Dora
,
clinging
to
them
both
,
and
weeping
,
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
O
yes
,
aunts
!
Please
take
Julia
Mills
and
me
and
Jip
to
*NL*
Putney
!
''
So
they
went
,
very
soon
after
the
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
I
found
time
to
haunt
Putney
,
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
;
but
I
*NL*
contrived
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
to
prowl
about
the
neighbourhood
*NL*
pretty
often
.
Miss
Mills
,
for
the
more
exact
discharge
of
the
duties
of
*NL*
friendship
,
kept
a
journal
;
and
she
used
to
meet
me
sometimes
,
on
the
*NL*
Common
,
and
read
it
,
or

CHAPTER
XXXIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
WICKFIELD
AND
HEEP
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
beginning
,
I
imagine
,
to
be
made
seriously
uncomfortable
by
my
*NL*
prolonged
dejection
,
made
a
pretence
of
being
anxious
that
I
should
go
*NL*
to
Dover
,
to
see
that
all
was
working
well
at
the
cottage
,
which
was
*NL*
let
;
and
to
conclude
an
agreement
,
with
the
same
tenant
,
for
a
longer
*NL*
term
of
occupation
.
Janet
was
drafted
into
the
service
of
Mrs.
Strong
,
*NL*
where
I
saw
her
every
day
.
She
had
been
undecided
,
on
leaving
Dover
,
*NL*
whether
or
no
to
give
the
finishing
touch
to
that
renunciation
of
*NL*
mankind
in
which
she
had
been
educated
,
by
marrying
a
pilot
;
but
she
*NL*
decided
against
that
venture
.
Not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
principle
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
as
because
she
happened
not
to
like
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
it
required
an
effort
to
leave
Miss
Mills
,
I
fell
rather
*NL*
willingly
into
my
aunt
's
pretence
,
as
a
means
of
enabling
me
to
pass
a
*NL*
few
tranquil
hours
with
Agnes
.
I
consulted
the
good
Doctor
relative
to
*NL*
an
absence
of
three
days
;
and
the
Doctor
wishing
me
to
take
that
*NL*
relaxation
,
--
he
wished
me
to
take
more
;
but
my
energy
could
not
bear
*NL*
that
,
--
I
made
up
my
mind
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
Commons
,
I
had
no
great
occasion
to
be
particular
about
my
*NL*
duties
in
that
quarter
.
To
say
the
truth
,
we
were
getting
in
no
very
*NL*
good
odour
among
the
tip-top
proctors
,
and
were
rapidly
sliding
down
to
*NL*
but
a
doubtful
position
.
The
business
had
been
indifferent
under
Mr.
*NL*
Jorkins
,
before
Mr.
Spenlow
's
time
;
and
although
it
had
been
quickened
*NL*
by
the
infusion
of
new
blood
,
and
by
the
display
which
Mr.
Spenlow
made
,
*NL*
still
it
was
not
established
on
a
sufficiently
strong
basis
to
bear
,
*NL*
without
being
shaken
,
such
a
blow
as
the
sudden
loss
of
its
active
*NL*
manager
.
It
fell
off
very
much
.
Mr.
Jorkins
,
notwithstanding
his
*NL*
reputation
in
the
firm
,
was
an
easy-going
,
incapable
,
sort
of
man
,
whose
*NL*
reputation
out
of
doors
was
not
calculated
to
back
it
up
.
I
was
turned
*NL*
over
to
him
now
,
and
when
I
saw
him
take
his
snuff
and
let
the
business
*NL*
go
,
I
regretted
my
aunt
's
thousand
pounds
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
the
worst
of
it
.
There
were
a
number
of
hangers-on
and
*NL*
outsiders
about
the
Commons
,
who
,
without
being
proctors
themselves
,
*NL*
dabbled
in
common-form
business
,
and
got
it
done
by
real
proctors
,
who
*NL*
lent
their
names
in
consideration
of
a
share
in
the
spoil
;
--
and
there
*NL*
were
a
good
many
of
these
too
.
As
our
house
now
wanted
business
on
any
*NL*
terms
,
we
joined
this
noble
band
;
and
threw
out
lures
to
the
hangers-on
*NL*
and
outsiders
,
to
bring
their
business
to
us
.
Marriage
licenses
and
*NL*
small
probates
were
what
we
all
looked
for
,
and
what
paid
us
best
;
and
*NL*
the
competition
for
these
,
ran
very
high
indeed
.
Kidnappers
and
*NL*
inveiglers
were
planted
in
all
the
avenues
of
entrance
to
the
Commons
,
*NL*
with
instructions
to
do
their
utmost
to
cut
off
all
persons
in
mourning
,
*NL*
and
all
gentlemen
with
anything
bashful
in
their
appearance
,
and
entice
*NL*
them
to
the
offices
in
which
their
respective
employers
were
interested
;
*NL*
which
instructions
were
so
well
observed
,
that
I
myself
,
before
I
was
*NL*
known
by
sight
,
was
twice
hustled
into
the
premises
of
our
principal
*NL*
opponent
.
The
conflicting
interests
of
these
touting
gentlemen
being
of
*NL*
a
nature
to
irritate
their
feelings
,
personal
collisions
took
place
;
and
*NL*
the
Commons
was
even
scandalised
by
our
principal
inveigler
-LRB-
who
had
*NL*
formerly
been
in
the
wine
trade
,
and
afterwards
in
the
sworn
brokery
*NL*
line
-RRB-
walking
about
for
some
days
with
a
black
eye
.
Any
one
of
these
*NL*
scouts
used
to
think
nothing
of
politely
assisting
an
old
lady
in
black
*NL*
out
of
a
vehicle
,
killing
any
proctor
whom
she
inquired
for
,
*NL*
representing
his
employer
as
the
lawful
successor
and
representative
of
*NL*
that
proctor
,
and
bearing
the
old
lady
off
-LRB-
sometimes
greatly
affected
-RRB-
*NL*
to
his
employer
's
office
.
Many
captives
were
brought
to
me
in
this
way
.
*NL*
As
to
marriage
licenses
,
the
competition
rose
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
a
*NL*
shy
gentleman
in
want
of
one
,
had
nothing
to
do
but
submit
himself
to
*NL*
the
first
inveigler
,
or
be
fought
for
,
and
become
the
prey
of
the
*NL*
strongest
.
One
of
our
clerks
,
who
was
an
outsider
,
used
,
in
the
height
*NL*
of
this
contest
,
to
sit
with
his
hat
on
,
that
he
might
be
ready
to
rush
*NL*
out
and
swear
before
a
surrogate
any
victim
who
was
brought
in
.
The
*NL*
system
of
inveigling
continues
,
I
believe
,
to
this
day
.
The
last
time
I
*NL*
was
in
the
Commons
,
a
civil
able-bodied
person
in
a
white
apron
pounced
*NL*
out
upon
me
from
a
doorway
,
and
whispering
the
word
``
Marriage-license
''
*NL*
in
my
ear
,
was
with
great
difficulty
prevented
from
taking
me
up
in
his
*NL*
arms
and
lifting
me
into
a
proctor
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
digression
,
let
me
proceed
to
Dover
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
everything
in
a
satisfactory
state
at
the
cottage
;
and
was
*NL*
enabled
to
gratify
my
aunt
exceedingly
by
reporting
that
the
tenant
*NL*
inherited
her
feud
,
and
waged
incessant
war
against
donkies
.
Having
*NL*
settled
the
little
business
I
had
to
transact
there
,
and
slept
there
one
*NL*
night
,
I
walked
on
to
Canterbury
early
in
the
morning
.
It
was
now
winter
*NL*
again
;
and
the
fresh
,
cold
windy
day
,
and
the
sweeping
downland
,
*NL*
brightened
up
my
hopes
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
into
Canterbury
,
I
loitered
through
the
old
streets
with
a
sober
*NL*
pleasure
that
calmed
my
spirits
,
and
eased
my
heart
.
There
were
the
old
*NL*
signs
,
the
old
names
over
the
shops
,
the
old
people
serving
in
them
.
It
*NL*
appeared
so
long
,
since
I
had
been
a
schoolboy
there
,
that
I
wondered
*NL*
the
place
was
so
little
changed
,
until
I
reflected
how
little
I
was
*NL*
changed
myself
.
Strange
to
say
,
that
quiet
influence
which
was
*NL*
inseparable
in
my
mind
from
Agnes
,
seemed
to
pervade
even
the
city
where
*NL*
she
dwelt
.
The
venerable
cathedral
towers
,
and
the
old
jackdaws
and
*NL*
rooks
whose
airy
voices
made
them
more
retired
than
perfect
silence
*NL*
would
have
done
;
the
battered
gateways
,
once
stuck
full
with
statues
,
*NL*
long
thrown
down
,
and
crumbled
away
,
like
the
reverential
pilgrims
who
*NL*
had
gazed
upon
them
;
the
still
nooks
,
where
the
ivied
growth
of
*NL*
centuries
crept
over
gabled
ends
and
ruined
walls
;
the
ancient
houses
,
*NL*
the
pastoral
landscape
of
field
,
orchard
,
and
garden
;
everywhere
--
on
*NL*
everything
--
I
felt
the
same
serener
air
,
the
same
calm
,
thoughtful
,
*NL*
softening
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
Mr.
Wickfield
's
house
,
I
found
,
in
the
little
lower-room
on
*NL*
the
ground
floor
,
where
Uriah
Heep
had
been
of
old
accustomed
to
sit
,
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
plying
his
pen
with
great
assiduity
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
*NL*
legal-looking
suit
of
black
,
and
loomed
,
burly
and
large
,
in
that
small
*NL*
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
extremely
glad
to
see
me
,
but
a
little
confused
too
.
He
*NL*
would
have
conducted
me
immediately
into
the
presence
of
Uriah
,
but
I
*NL*
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
house
of
old
,
you
recollect
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
will
find
my
way
*NL*
up
stairs
.
How
do
you
like
the
law
,
Mr.
Micawber
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield

''
he
replied
.
``
To
a
man
possessed
of
the
higher
*NL*
imaginative
powers
,
the
objection
to
legal
studies
is
the
amount
of
*NL*
detail
which
they
involve
.
Even
in
our
professional
correspondence
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
glancing
at
some
letters
he
was
writing
,
``
the
mind
is
*NL*
not
at
liberty
to
soar
to
any
exalted
form
of
expression
.
Still
,
it
is
a
*NL*
great
pursuit
.
A
great
pursuit

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
told
me
that
he
had
become
the
tenant
of
Uriah
Heep
's
old
house
;
*NL*
and
that
Mrs.
Micawber
would
be
delighted
to
receive
me
,
once
more
,
*NL*
under
her
own
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
humble
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
--
to
quote
a
favourite
expression
of
*NL*
my
friend
Heep
;
but
it
may
prove
the
stepping-stone
to
more
ambitious
*NL*
domiciliary
accommodation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
whether
he
had
reason
,
so
far
,
to
be
satisfied
with
his
*NL*
friend
Heep
's
treatment
of
him
?
He
got
up
to
ascertain
if
the
door
were
*NL*
close
shut
,
before
he
replied
,
in
a
lower
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield

a
man

labours
under

pressure

generality

,
at
a
disadvantage

*NL*
That
disadvantage
is
not
diminished
,
when
that
pressure
necessitates
the
*NL*
drawing
of
stipendiary
emoluments
,
before
those
emoluments
are
strictly
*NL*
due
and
payable
.
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
my
friend
Heep
has
responded
to
*NL*
appeals
to
which
I
need
not
more
particularly
refer
,
in
a
manner
*NL*
calculated
to
redound
equally
to
the
honour
of
his
head
,
and
of
his
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
supposed
him
to
be
very
free
with
his
money
either
,
''
*NL*
I
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
!
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
an
air
of
constraint
,
``
I
speak
of
*NL*
my
friend
Heep
as
I
have
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
your
experience
is
so
favourable
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
obliging
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
;
and
*NL*
hummed
a
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
much
of
Mr.
Wickfield
?
''
I
asked
,
to
change
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
slightingly
.
``
Mr.
Wickfield
is
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
a
man
of
very
excellent
intentions
;
but
he
is
--
in
short
,
he
is
*NL*
obsolete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
his
partner
seeks
to
make
him
so
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
!
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
after
some
uneasy
*NL*
evolutions
on
his
stool
,
``
allow
me
to
offer
a
remark
!
I
am
here
,
in
*NL*
a
capacity
of
confidence
.
I
am
here
,
in
a
position
of
trust

The
*NL*
discussion
of
some
topics
,
even
with
Mrs.
Micawber
herself
-LRB-
so
long
*NL*
the
partner
of
my
various
vicissitudes
,
and
a
woman
of
a
remarkable
*NL*
lucidity
of
intellect
-RRB-
,
is
,
I
am
led
to
consider
,
incompatible
with
*NL*
the
functions
now
devolving
on
me
.
I
would
therefore
take
the
liberty
*NL*
of
suggesting
that
in
our
friendly
intercourse
--
which
I
trust
will
*NL*
never
be
disturbed
!
--
we
draw
a
line
.
On
one
side
of
this
line
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
representing
it
on
the
desk
with
the
office
ruler
,
``
is
*NL*
the
whole
range
of
the
human
intellect
,
with
a
trifling
exception

on

the
other

_
is
_
that
exception
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
affairs
of
Messrs.
*NL*
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
with
all
belonging
and
appertaining
thereunto
.
I
*NL*
trust
I
give
no
offence
to
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
in
submitting
*NL*
this
proposition
to
his
cooler
judgment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
saw
an
uneasy
change
in
Mr.
Micawber
,
which
sat
tightly
on
him
,
*NL*
as
if
his
new
duties
were
a
misfit
,
I
felt
I
had
no
right
to
be
*NL*
offended
.
My
telling
him
so
,
appeared
to
relieve
him
;
and
he
shook
hands
*NL*
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
charmed
,
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
let
me
assure
you
,
with
*NL*
Miss
Wickfield

She
is
a
very
superior
young
lady

of
very
remarkable
*NL*
attractions
,
graces
,
and
virtues
.
Upon
my
honour

''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
indefinitely
kissing
his
hand
and
bowing
with
his
genteelest
air
,
``
I
do
*NL*
Homage
to
Miss
Wickfield

Hem

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
that

at

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
not
assured
us
,
my
dear
Copperfield

on
the
occasion
of
that
*NL*
agreeable
afternoon
we
had
the
happiness
of
passing
with
you
,
that
D
was
*NL*
your
favourite
letter
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
I
should
unquestionably
have
*NL*
supposed
that
A
had
been
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
all
some
experience
of
a
feeling
,
that
comes
over
us
*NL*
occasionally
,
of
what
we
are
saying
and
doing
having
been
said
and
done
*NL*
before
,
in
a
remote
time
--
of
our
having
been
surrounded
,
dim
ages
ago
,
*NL*
by
the
same
faces
,
objects
,
and
circumstances
--
of
our
knowing
perfectly
*NL*
what
will
be
said
next
,
as
if
we
suddenly
remembered
it
!
I
never
had
*NL*
this
mysterious
impression
more
strongly
in
my
life
,
than
before
he
*NL*
uttered
those
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
my
leave
of
Mr.
Micawber
,
for
the
time
,
charging
him
with
my
best
*NL*
remembrances
to
all
at
home
.
As
I
left
him
,
resuming
his
stool
and
his
*NL*
pen
,
and
rolling
his
head
in
his
stock
,
to
get
it
into
easier
writing
*NL*
order
,
I
clearly
perceived
that
there
was
something
interposed
between
*NL*
him
and
me
,
since
he
had
come
into
his
new
functions
which
prevented
our
*NL*
getting
at
each
other
as
we
used
to
do
,
and
quite
altered
the
character
*NL*
of
our
intercourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
quaint
old
drawing-room
,
though
it
presented
*NL*
tokens
of
Mrs.
Heep
's
whereabout
.
I
looked
into
the
room
still
belonging
*NL*
to
Agnes
,
and
saw
her
sitting
by
the
fire
,
at
a
pretty
old
fashioned
*NL*
desk
she
had
,
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
darkening
the
light
made
her
look
up
.
What
a
pleasure
to
be
the
cause
*NL*
of
that
bright
change
in
her
attentive
face
,
and
the
object
of
that
*NL*
sweet
regard
and
welcome
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Agnes
!
''
said
I
,
when
we
were
sitting
together
,
side
by
side
;
``
I
*NL*
have
missed
you
so
much
,
lately
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
she
replied
.
``
Again
!
And
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
Agnes
;
I
seem
to
want
some
faculty
of
mind
that
*NL*
I
ought
to
have
.
You
were
so
much
in
the
habit
of
thinking
for
me
,
in
*NL*
the
happy
old
days
here
,
and
I
came
so
naturally
to
you
for
counsel
and
*NL*
support
,
that
I
really
think
I
have
missed
acquiring
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
it
?
''
said
Agnes
,
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
call
it
,
''
I
replied
.
``
I
think
I
am
earnest
and
*NL*
persevering
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
of
it

said
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
patient

Agnes

I
enquired
,
with
a
little
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
returned
Agnes
,
laughing
.
``
Pretty
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
get
so
miserable
and
worried
,
and
am
so
unsteady
*NL*
and
irresolute
in
my
power
of
assuring
myself
,
that
I
know
I
must
*NL*
want
--
shall
I
call
it
--
reliance
,
of
some
kind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
so
,
if
you
will

said
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!

I
returned
.
``
See
here
!
You
come
to
London
,
I
rely
on
you
,
and
I
*NL*
have
an
object
and
a
course
at
once
.
I
am
driven
out
of
it
,
I
come
here
,
*NL*
and
in
a
moment
I
feel
an
altered
person
.
The
circumstances
that
*NL*
distressed
me
are
not
changed
,
since
I
came
into
this
room
;
but
an
*NL*
influence
comes
over
me
in
that
short
interval
that
alters
me
,
oh
,
how
*NL*
much
for
the
better
!
What
is
it
?
What
is
your
secret
,
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
head
was
bent
down
,
looking
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
old
story
,
''
said
I.
``
Do
n't
laugh
,
when
I
say
it
was
always
the
*NL*
same
in
little
things
as
it
is
in
greater
ones
.
My
old
troubles
were
*NL*
nonsense
,
and
now
they
are
serious
;
but
whenever
I
have
gone
away
from
*NL*
my
adopted
sister
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
looked
up
--
with
such
a
Heavenly
face
!
--
and
gave
me
her
hand
,
which
*NL*
I
kissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
I
have
not
had
you
,
Agnes
,
to
advise
and
approve
in
the
*NL*
beginning
,
I
have
seemed
to
go
wild
,
and
to
get
into
all
sorts
of
*NL*
difficulty
.
When
I
have
come
to
you
,
at
last
-LRB-
as
I
have
always
done
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
have
come
to
peace
and
happiness
.
I
come
home
,
now
,
like
a
tired
*NL*
traveller
,
and
find
such
a
blessed
sense
of
rest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
so
deeply
what
I
said
,
it
affected
me
so
sincerely
,
that
my
voice
*NL*
failed
,
and
I
covered
my
face
with
my
hand
,
and
broke
into
tears
.
I
*NL*
write
the
truth
.
Whatever
contradictions
and
inconsistencies
there
were
*NL*
within
me
,
as
there
are
within
so
many
of
us
;
whatever
might
have
been
*NL*
so
different
,
and
so
much
better
;
whatever
I
had
done
,
in
which
I
had
*NL*
perversely
wandered
away
from
the
voice
of
my
own
heart
;
I
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
.
I
only
knew
that
I
was
fervently
in
earnest
,
when
I
felt
the
rest
*NL*
and
peace
of
having
Agnes
near
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
placid
sisterly
manner
;
with
her
beaming
eyes
;
with
her
tender
*NL*
voice
;
and
with
that
sweet
composure
,
which
had
long
ago
made
the
house
*NL*
that
held
her
quite
a
sacred
place
to
me
;
she
soon
won
me
from
this
*NL*
weakness
,
and
led
me
on
to
tell
all
that
had
happened
since
our
last
*NL*
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
not
another
word
to
tell
,
Agnes
,
''
said
I
,
when
I
had
made
*NL*
an
end
of
my
confidence
.
``
Now
,
my
reliance
is
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
must
not
be
on
me
,
Trotwood
,
''
returned
Agnes
,
with
a
pleasant
*NL*
smile
.
``
It
must
be
on
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Dora
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
have
not
mentioned
,
Agnes
,
''
said
I
,
a
little
embarrassed
,
``
that
*NL*
Dora
is
rather
difficult
to
--
I
would
not
,
for
the
world
,
say
,
to
rely
*NL*
upon
,
because
she
is
the
soul
of
purity
and
truth
--
but
rather
difficult
*NL*
to
--
I
hardly
know
how
to
express
it
,
really
,
Agnes
.
She
is
a
timid
*NL*
little
thing
,
and
easily
disturbed
and
frightened
.
Some
time
ago
,
before
*NL*
her
father
's
death
,
when
I
thought
it
right
to
mention
to
her
--
but
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
,
how
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
I
told
Agnes
about
my
declaration
of
poverty
,
about
the
*NL*
cookery-book
,
the
housekeeping
accounts
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Trotwood
!
''
she
remonstrated
,
with
a
smile
.
``
Just
your
old
headlong
*NL*
way
!
You
might
have
been
in
earnest
in
striving
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
*NL*
without
being
so
very
sudden
with
a
timid
,
loving
,
inexperienced
girl
.
*NL*
Poor
Dora
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
heard
such
sweet
forbearing
kindness
expressed
in
a
voice
,
as
*NL*
she
expressed
in
making
this
reply
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
seen
her
*NL*
admiringly
and
tenderly
embracing
Dora
,
and
tacitly
reproving
me
,
by
her
*NL*
considerate
protection
,
for
my
hot
haste
in
fluttering
that
little
*NL*
heart
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
seen
Dora
,
in
all
her
fascinating
artlessness
,
*NL*
caressing
Agnes
,
and
thanking
her
,
and
coaxingly
appealing
against
me
,
*NL*
and
loving
me
with
all
her
childish
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
so
grateful
to
Agnes
,
and
admired
her
so
!
I
saw
those
two
*NL*
together
,
in
a
bright
perspective
,
such
well-associated
friends
,
each
*NL*
adorning
the
other
so
much
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ought
I
to
do
then
,
Agnes
?
''
I
inquired
,
after
looking
at
the
fire
*NL*
a
little
while
.
``
What
would
it
be
right
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
that
the
honourable
course
to
take
,
would
be
to
*NL*
write
to
those
two
ladies

Do
n't
you
think
that
any
secret
course
is
an
*NL*
unworthy
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
If
_
you
_
think
so
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
poorly
qualified
to
judge
of
such
matters
,
''
replied
Agnes
,
with
a
*NL*
modest
hesitation
,
``
but
I
certainly
feel
--
in
short
,
I
feel
that
your
*NL*
being
secret
and
clandestine
,
is
not
being
like
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
myself
,
in
the
too
high
opinion
you
have
of
me
,
Agnes
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
yourself
in
the
candour
of
your
nature

''
she
returned
;
``
and
*NL*
therefore
I
would
write
to
those
two
ladies

I
would
relate
,
as
plainly
*NL*
and
as
openly
as
possible
,
all
that
has
taken
place
;
and
I
would
ask
*NL*
their
permission
to
visit
sometimes
,
at
their
house
.
Considering
that
*NL*
you
are
young
,
and
striving
for
a
place
in
life
,
I
think
it
would
be
*NL*
well
to
say
that
you
would
readily
abide
by
any
conditions
they
might
*NL*
impose
upon
you

I
would
entreat
them
not
to
dismiss
your
request

*NL*
without
a
reference
to
Dora
;
and
to
discuss
it
with
her
when
they
should
*NL*
think
the
time
suitable

I
would
not
be
too
vehement

said
Agnes
,
*NL*
gently
,
``

propose
too
much

I

trust

my
fidelity

perseverance

Dora

*NL*
``
But
if
they
were
to
frighten
Dora
again

Agnes

by
speaking
to
her

*NL*

I.
``
And
if
Dora
were
to
cry
,
and
say
nothing
about
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
likely
?
''
inquired
Agnes
,
with
the
same
sweet
consideration
in
*NL*
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
her
,
she
is
as
easily
scared
as
a
bird
,
''
said
I.
``
It
might
*NL*
be
!
Or
if
the
two
Miss
Spenlows
-LRB-
elderly
ladies
of
that
sort
are
odd
*NL*
characters
sometimes
-RRB-
should
not
be
likely
persons
to
address
in
that
*NL*
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
,
Trotwood
,
''
returned
Agnes
,
raising
her
soft
eyes
to
*NL*
mine
,
``
I
would
consider
that
.
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
only
to
*NL*
consider
whether
it
is
right
to
do
this
;
and
,
if
it
is
,
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
longer
any
doubt
on
the
subject
.
With
a
lightened
heart
,
though
*NL*
with
a
profound
sense
of
the
weighty
importance
of
my
task
,
I
devoted
*NL*
the
whole
afternoon
to
the
composition
of
the
draft
of
this
letter
;
for
*NL*
which
great
purpose
,
Agnes
relinquished
her
desk
to
me
.
But
first
I
went
*NL*
down
stairs
to
see
Mr.
Wickfield
and
Uriah
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Uriah
in
possession
of
a
new
,
plaster-smelling
office
,
built
out
*NL*
in
the
garden
;
looking
extraordinarily
mean
,
in
the
midst
of
a
quantity
*NL*
of
books
and
papers
.
He
received
me
in
his
usual
fawning
way
,
and
*NL*
pretended
not
to
have
heard
of
my
arrival
from
Mr.
Micawber
;
a
pretence
*NL*
I
took
the
liberty
of
disbelieving
.
He
accompanied
me
into
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
's
room
,
which
was
the
shadow
of
its
former
self
--
having
been
*NL*
divested
of
a
variety
of
conveniences
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
new
*NL*
partner
--
and
stood
before
the
fire
,
warming
his
back
,
and
shaving
his
*NL*
chin
with
his
bony
hand
,
while
Mr.
Wickfield
and
I
exchanged
greetings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
while
you
remain
in
Canterbury
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
,
not
without
a
glance
at
Uriah
for
his
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
room
for
me
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
Master
Copperfield
--
I
should
say
Mister
,
but
the
other
comes
*NL*
so
natural
,
''
said
Uriah
,
--
``
I
would
turn
out
of
your
old
room
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
if
it
would
be
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
.
``
Why
should
_
you
_
be
inconvenienced
?
*NL*
There
's
another
room
.
There
's
another
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
know
,
''
returned
Uriah
,
with
a
grin
,
``
I
should
really
be
*NL*
delighted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
cut
the
matter
short
,
I
said
I
would
have
the
other
room
or
none
at
*NL*
all
;
so
it
was
settled
that
I
should
have
the
other
room
:
and
,
taking
my
*NL*
leave
of
the
firm
until
dinner
,
I
went
up
stairs
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
hoped
,
to
have
no
other
companion
than
Agnes
.
But
Mrs.
Heep
had
*NL*
asked
permission
to
bring
herself
and
her
knitting
near
the
fire
,
*NL*
in
that
room
;
on
pretence
of
its
having
an
aspect
more
favourable
*NL*
for
her
rheumatics
,
as
the
wind
then
was
,
than
the
drawing-room
or
*NL*
dining-parlour
.
Though
I
could
almost
have
consigned
her
to
the
mercies
*NL*
of
the
wind
on
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
the
Cathedral
,
without
remorse
,
*NL*
I
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
gave
her
a
friendly
salutation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
umbly
thankful
to
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Heep
,
in
acknowledgment
of
*NL*
my
inquiries
concerning
her
health
,
``
but
I
'm
only
pretty
well
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
much
to
boast
of
.
If
I
could
see
my
Uriah
well
settled
in
life
,
I
*NL*
could
n't
expect
much
more
I
think
.
How
do
you
think
my
Ury
looking
,
*NL*
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
him
looking
as
villanous
as
ever
,
and
I
replied
that
I
saw
no
*NL*
change
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
you
think
he
's
changed
?
''
said
Mrs.
Heep
.
``
There
I
must
umbly
*NL*
beg
leave
to
differ
from
you
.
Do
n't
you
see
a
thinness
in
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
usual
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Do
n't
_
you
though
!
''
said
Mrs.
Heep
.
``
But
you
do
n't
take
notice
of
him
*NL*
with
a
mother
's
eye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
's
eye
was
an
evil
eye
to
the
rest
of
the
world
,
I
thought
as
*NL*
it
met
mine
,
howsoever
affectionate
to
him
;
and
I
believe
she
and
her
*NL*
son
were
devoted
to
one
another
.
It
passed
me
,
and
went
on
to
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
_
you
_
see
a
wasting
and
a
wearing
in
him
,
Miss
Wickfield
?
''
*NL*
inquired
Mrs.
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Agnes
,
quietly
pursuing
the
work
on
which
she
was
engaged
.
*NL*
``
You
are
too
solicitous
about
him
.
He
is
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Heep
,
with
a
prodigious
sniff
,
resumed
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
left
off
,
or
left
us
for
a
moment
.
I
had
arrived
early
in
the
*NL*
day
,
and
we
had
still
three
or
four
hours
before
dinner
;
but
she
sat
*NL*
there
,
plying
her
knitting-needles
as
monotonously
as
an
hour-glass
*NL*
might
have
poured
out
its
sands
.
She
sat
on
one
side
of
the
fire
;
I
sat
*NL*
at
the
desk
in
front
of
it
;
a
little
beyond
me
,
on
the
other
side
,
sat
*NL*
Agnes
.
Whensoever
,
slowly
pondering
over
my
letter
,
I
lifted
up
my
eyes
,
*NL*
and
meeting
the
thoughtful
face
of
Agnes
,
saw
it
clear
,
and
beam
*NL*
encouragement
upon
me
,
with
its
own
angelic
expression
,
I
was
conscious
*NL*
presently
of
the
evil
eye
passing
me
,
and
going
on
to
her
,
and
coming
*NL*
back
to
me
again
,
and
dropping
furtively
upon
the
knitting
.
What
the
*NL*
knitting
was
,
I
do
n't
know
,
not
being
learned
in
that
art
;
but
it
looked
*NL*
like
a
net
;
and
as
she
worked
away
with
those
Chinese
chopsticks
of
*NL*
knitting-needles
,
she
showed
in
the
firelight
like
an
ill-looking
*NL*
enchantress
,
baulked
as
yet
by
the
radiant
goodness
opposite
,
but
*NL*
getting
ready
for
a
cast
of
her
net
by-and-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
she
maintained
her
watch
,
with
the
same
unwinking
eyes
.
After
*NL*
dinner
,
her
son
took
his
turn
;
and
when
Mr.
Wickfield
,
himself
,
and
I
*NL*
were
left
alone
together
,
leered
at
me
,
and
writhed
until
I
could
hardly
*NL*
bear
it
.
In
the
drawing-room
,
there
was
the
mother
knitting
and
watching
*NL*
again
.
All
the
time
that
Agnes
sang
and
played
,
the
mother
sat
at
the
*NL*
piano
.
Once
she
asked
for
a
particular
ballad
,
which
she
said
her
Ury
*NL*
-LRB-
who
was
yawning
in
a
great
chair
-RRB-
doted
on
;
and
at
intervals
she
looked
*NL*
round
at
him
,
and
reported
to
Agnes
that
he
was
in
raptures
with
the
*NL*
music
.
But
she
hardly
ever
spoke
--
I
question
if
she
ever
did
--
without
*NL*
making
some
mention
of
him
.
It
was
evident
to
me
that
this
was
the
duty
*NL*
assigned
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lasted
until
bedtime
.
To
have
seen
the
mother
and
son
,
like
two
*NL*
great
bats
hanging
over
the
whole
house
,
and
darkening
it
with
their
*NL*
ugly
forms
,
made
me
so
uncomfortable
,
that
I
would
rather
have
remained
*NL*
down
stairs
,
knitting
and
all
,
than
gone
to
bed
.
I
hardly
got
any
sleep
.
*NL*
Next
day
the
knitting
and
watching
began
again
,
and
lasted
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Agnes
,
for
ten
minutes
.
I
could
*NL*
barely
show
her
my
letter
.
I
proposed
to
her
to
walk
out
with
me
;
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Heep
repeatedly
complaining
that
she
was
worse
,
Agnes
charitably
*NL*
remained
within
,
to
bear
her
company
.
Towards
the
twilight
I
went
out
by
*NL*
myself
,
musing
on
what
I
ought
to
do
,
and
whether
I
was
justified
in
*NL*
withholding
from
Agnes
,
any
longer
,
what
Uriah
Heep
had
told
me
in
*NL*
London
;
for
that
began
to
trouble
me
again
,
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
walked
out
far
enough
to
be
quite
clear
of
the
town
,
upon
the
*NL*
Ramsgate
road
,
where
there
was
a
good
path
,
when
I
was
hailed
,
through
*NL*
the
dusk
,
by
somebody
behind
me
.
The
shambling
figure
,
and
the
scanty
*NL*
great
coat
,
were
not
to
be
mistaken
.
I
stopped
,
and
Uriah
Heep
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fast
you
walk
!
''
said
he
.
``
My
legs
are
pretty
long
,
but
you
've
given
*NL*
'em
quite
a
job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
coming
with
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
a
walk
with
an
old
acquaintance
.
''
Saying
this
,
with
a
jerk
*NL*
of
his
body
,
which
might
have
been
either
propitiatory
or
derisive
,
he
*NL*
fell
into
step
beside
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uriah
!
''
said
I
,
as
civilly
as
I
could
,
after
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Copperfield
!
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
-LRB-
at
which
you
will
not
be
offended
-RRB-
,
I
came
out
*NL*
to
walk
alone
,
because
I
have
had
so
much
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
sideways
,
and
said
with
his
hardest
grin
,
``
You
mean
*NL*
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
yes
,
I
do
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
But
you
know
we
're
so
very
umble
,
''
he
returned
.
``
And
having
such
a
*NL*
knowledge
of
our
own
umbleness
,
we
must
really
take
care
that
we
're
not
*NL*
pushed
to
the
wall
by
them
as
is
n't
umble
.
All
stratagems
are
fair
in
*NL*
love
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raising
his
great
hands
until
they
touched
his
chin
,
he
rubbed
them
*NL*
softly
,
and
softly
chuckled
;
looking
as
like
a
malevolent
baboon
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
as
anything
human
could
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
still
hugging
himself
in
that
unpleasant
way
,
and
*NL*
shaking
his
head
at
me
,
``
you
're
quite
a
dangerous
rival
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
.
You
always
was
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
set
a
watch
upon
Miss
Wickfield
,
and
make
her
home
no
home
,
*NL*
because
of
me
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Master
Copperfield
!
Those
are
very
arsh
words

''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
my
meaning
into
any
words
you
like

said
I.
``
You
know
what
it
is

Uriah

as
well
as
I
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
You
must
put
it
into
words

''
he
said
.
``
Oh
,
really
!
I
could
n't
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
,
''
said
I
,
constraining
myself
to
be
very
temperate
and
*NL*
quiet
with
him
,
on
account
of
Agnes
,
``
that
I
regard
Miss
Wickfield
*NL*
otherwise
than
as
a
very
dear
sister

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Master
Copperfield

he
replied
,
``
you
perceive
I
am
not
bound

answer

you
see

you
*NL*
may

*NL*
*NL*
Anything
to
equal
the
low
cunning
of
his
visage
,
and
of
his
shadowless
*NL*
eyes
without
the
ghost
of
an
eyelash
,
I
never
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
I.
``
For
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

he
exclaimed
,
with
a
sickly
,
angular
contortion
of
himself
.
*NL*
``
Would
you
be
so
good
as
call
her
Agnes

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

said
Uriah
,
stretching
out
his
neck
,
and
shading
his
ear
*NL*
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

I
returned
.
``
The

though
his

face
had
suggested
the

quite
as
a
natural

Uriah

*NL*
I
was
about
indignantly
to
give
my
assertion
the
confirmation
he
*NL*
required

when
he
caught
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

he
said

``
If

the
night
I
put

As
it
is
,
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
'll
take
off
mother
directly
,
and
only
too
appy
.
I
know
you
'll
*NL*
excuse
the
precautions
of
affection
,
wo
n't
you
?
What
a
pity
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
,
that
you
did
n't
condescend
to
return
my
confidence
!
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
gave
you
every
opportunity
.
But
you
never
have
condescended
to
*NL*
me
,
as
much
as
I
could
have
wished
.
I
know
you
have
never
liked
me
,
as
I
*NL*
have
liked
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
he
was
squeezing
my
hand
with
his
damp
fishey
fingers
,
*NL*
while
I
made
every
effort
I
decently
could
to
get
it
away
.
But
I
was
*NL*
quite
unsuccessful
.
He
drew
it
under
the
sleeve
of
his
mulberry-colored
*NL*
great
coat
,
and
I
walked
on
,
almost
upon
compulsion
,
arm
in
arm
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
turn
?
''
said
Uriah
,
by-and-by
wheeling
me
face
about
towards
*NL*
the
town
,
on
which
the
early
moon
was
now
shining
,
silvering
the
distant
*NL*
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
we
leave
the
subject
,
you
ought
to
understand
,
''
said
I
,
breaking
*NL*
a
pretty
long
silence
,
``
that
I
believe
Agnes
Wickfield
to
be
as
far
*NL*
above
_
you
_
,

far
removed
from
all
_
your

,
as
that
*NL*
moon
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peaceful
!
Ai
n't
she
!
''
said
Uriah
.
``
Very
!
Now
confess
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
,
that
you
have
n't
liked
me
quite
as
I

you

All
*NL*
along
you
've
thought
me
too
umble
now
,
I
should
n't
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
fond
of
professions
of
humility
,
''
I
returned
,
``
or
professions
*NL*
of
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
''
said
Uriah
,
looking
flabby
and
lead-coloured
in
the
*NL*
moonlight
.
``
Did
n't
I
know
it
!
But
how
little
you
think
of
the
rightful
*NL*
umbleness
of
a
person
in
my
station
,
Master
Copperfield
!
Father
and
me
*NL*
was
both
brought
up
at
a
foundation
school
for
boys
;
and
mother
,
she
was
*NL*
likewise
brought
up
at
a
public
,
sort
of
charitable
,
establishment
.
They
*NL*
taught
us
all
a
deal
of
umbleness
--
not
much
else
that
I
know
of
,
from
*NL*
morning
to
night
.
We
was
to
be
umble
to
this
person
,
and
umble
to
that
;
*NL*
and
to
pull
off
our
caps
here
,
and
to
make
bows
there
;
and
always
to
*NL*
know
our
place
,
and
abase
ourselves
before
our
betters
.
And
we
had
such
*NL*
a
lot
of
betters
!
Father
got
the
monitor-medal
by
being
umble
.
So
did
I.
*NL*
Father
got
made
a
sexton
by
being
umble
.
He
had
the
character
,
among
the
*NL*
gentlefolks
,
of
being
such
a
well-behaved
man
,
that
they
were
determined
*NL*
to
bring
him
in
.
`
Be
umble
,
Uriah
,
'
says
father
to
me
,
`
and
you
'll
get
*NL*
on
.
It
was
what
was
always
being
dinned
into
you
and
me
at
school
;
it
's
*NL*
what
goes
down
best
.
Be
umble
,
'
says
father
,
`
and
you
'll
do
!
'
And
really
*NL*
it
ai
n't
done
bad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
occurred
to
me
,
that
this
detestable
*NL*
cant
of
false
humility
might
have
originated
out
of
the
Heep
family
.
I
*NL*
had
seen
the
harvest
,
but
had
never
thought
of
the
seed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
quite
a
young
boy
,
''
said
Uriah
,
``
I
got
to
know
what
*NL*
umbleness
did
,
and
I
took
to
it
.
I
ate
umble
pie
with
an
appetite
.
I
*NL*
stopped
at
the
umble
point
of
my
learning
,
and
says
I
,
`
Hold
hard
!
'
When
*NL*
you
offered
to
teach
me
Latin
,
I
knew
better
.
`
People
like
to
be
above
*NL*
you
,
'
says
father
,
`
keep
yourself
down
.
'
I
am
very
umble
to
the
present
*NL*
moment
,
Master
Copperfield
,
but
I
've
got
a
little
power
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
said
all
this
--
I
knew
,
as
I
saw
his
face
in
the
moonlight
--
that
I
*NL*
might
understand
he
was
resolved
to
recompense
himself
by
using
his
*NL*
power
.
I
had
never
doubted
his
meanness
,
his
craft
and
malice
;
but
I
*NL*
fully
comprehended
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
what
a
base
,
unrelenting
,
*NL*
and
revengeful
spirit
,
must
have
been
engendered
by
this
early
,
and
this
*NL*
long
,
suppression
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
account
of
himself
was
so
far
attended
with
an
agreeable
result
,
*NL*
that
it
led
to
his
withdrawing
his
hand
in
order
that
he
might
have
*NL*
another
hug
of
himself
under
the
chin
.
Once
apart
from
him
,
I
was
*NL*
determined
to
keep
apart
;
and
we
walked
back
,
side
by
side
,
saying
very
*NL*
little
more
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
his
spirits
were
elevated
by
the
communication
I
had
made
to
*NL*
him
,
or
by
his
having
indulged
in
this
retrospect
,
I
do
n't
know
;
but
*NL*
they
were
raised
by
some
influence
.
He
talked
more
at
dinner
than
*NL*
was
usual
with
him
;
asked
his
mother
-LRB-
off
duty
,
from
the
moment
of
*NL*
our
re-entering
the
house
-RRB-
,
whether
he
was
not
growing
too
old
for
a
*NL*
bachelor
;
and
once
looked
at
Agnes
so
,
that
I
would
have
given
all
I
*NL*
had
,
for
leave
to
knock
him
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
three
males
were
left
alone
after
dinner
,
he
got
into
a
more
*NL*
adventurous
state
.
He
had
taken
little
or
no
wine
;
and
I
presume
it
was
*NL*
the
mere
insolence
of
triumph
that
was
upon
him
,
flushed
perhaps
by
the
*NL*
temptation
my
presence
furnished
to
its
exhibition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
observed
yesterday
,
that
he
tried
to
entice
Mr.
Wickfield
to
*NL*
drink
;
and
,
interpreting
the
look
which
Agnes
had
given
me
as
she
went
*NL*
out
,
had
limited
myself
to
one
glass
,
and
then
proposed
that
we
should
*NL*
follow
her
.
I
would
have
done
so
again
to-day
;
but
Uriah
was
too
quick
*NL*
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
seldom
see
our
present
visitor
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
,
sitting
,
such
a
contrast
to
him
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
*NL*
``
and
I
should
propose
to
give
him
welcome
in
another
glass
or
two
of
*NL*
wine
,
if
you
have
no
objections
.
Mr.
Copperfield
,
your
elth
and
*NL*
appiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
make
a
show
of
taking
the
hand
he
stretched
across
to
*NL*
me
;
and
then
,
with
very
different
emotions
,
I
took
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
broken
gentleman
,
his
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
fellow
partner
,
''
said
Uriah
,
``
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
,
--
now
,
*NL*
suppose
you
give
us
something
or
another
appropriate
to
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
pass
over
Mr.
Wickfield
's
proposing
my
aunt
,
his
proposing
Mr.
Dick
,
*NL*
his
proposing
Doctor
's
Commons
,
his
proposing
Uriah
,
his
drinking
*NL*
everything
twice
;
his
consciousness
of
his
own
weakness
,
the
ineffectual
*NL*
effort
that
he
made
against
it
;
the
struggle
between
his
shame
in
*NL*
Uriah
's
deportment
,
and
his
desire
to
conciliate
him
;
the
manifest
*NL*
exultation
with
which
Uriah
twisted
and
turned
,
and
held
him
up
before
*NL*
me
.
It
made
me
sick
at
heart
to
see
,
and
my
hand
recoils
from
writing
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
fellow
partner
!
''
said
Uriah
,
at
last
,
''
_
I
_
'll
give
you
another
*NL*
one
,
and
I
umbly
ask
for
bumpers
,
seeing
I
intend
to
make
it
the
*NL*
divinest
of
her
sex
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
had
his
empty
glass
in
his
hand
.
I
saw
him
set
it
down
,
look
*NL*
at
the
picture
she
was
so
like
,
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
shrink
*NL*
back
in
his
elbow
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
an
umble
individual
to
give
you
her
elth
,
''
proceeded
Uriah
,
``
but
I
*NL*
admire
--
adore
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
physical
pain
that
her
father
's
grey
head
could
have
borne
,
I
think
*NL*
could
have
been
more
terrible
to
me
,
than
the
mental
endurance
I
saw
*NL*
compressed
now
within
both
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
,
''
said
Uriah
,
either
not
regarding
him
,
or
not
knowing
what
the
*NL*
nature
of
his
action
was
,
``
Agnes
Wickfield
is
,
I
am
safe
to
say
,
the
*NL*
divinest

sex

May
I
speak
out
,
among
friends
?
To
be
her
father
is
*NL*
a
proud
distinction
,
but
to
be
her
usband
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Spare
me
from
ever
again
hearing
such
a
cry
,
as
that
with
which
her
*NL*
father
rose
up
from
the
table
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Uriah
,
turning
of
a
deadly
colour
.
``
You
are
*NL*
not
gone
mad
,
after
all

Mr.
Wickfield

hope

If

I

ambition

have
as
good
a
right
to
it

*NL*
another
man

I
have
a
better
right
to
it
than
any
other
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
my
arms
round
Mr.
Wickfield
,
imploring
him
by
everything
that
I
*NL*
could
think
of
,
oftenest
of
all
by
his
love
for
Agnes
,
to
calm
himself
a
*NL*
little
.
He
was
mad
for
the
moment
;
tearing
out
his
hair
,
beating
his
*NL*
head
,
trying
to
force
me
from
him
and
to
force
himself
from
me
,
not
*NL*
answering
a
word
,
not
looking
at
or
seeing
any
one
;
blindly
striving
for
*NL*
he
knew
not
what
,
his
face
all
staring
and
distorted
--
a
frightful
*NL*
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
conjured
him
,
incoherently
,
but
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
,
not
to
*NL*
abandon
himself
to
this
wildness
,
but
to
hear
me
.
I
besought
him
to
*NL*
think
of
Agnes
,
to
connect
me
with
Agnes
,
to
recollect
how
Agnes
and
I
*NL*
had
grown
up
together
,
how
I
honored
her
and
loved
her
,
how
she
was
his
*NL*
pride
and
joy
.
I
tried
to
bring
her
idea
before
him
in
any
form
;
I
even
*NL*
reproached
him
with
not
having
firmness
to
spare
her
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
such
a
scene
as
this
.
I
may
have
effected
something
,
or
his
wildness
may
*NL*
have
spent
itself
;
but
by
degrees
he
struggled
less
,
and
began
to
look
*NL*
at
me
--
strangely
at
first
,
then
with
recognition
in
his
eyes
.
At
length
*NL*
he
said
,
``
I
know
,
Trotwood
!
My
darling
child
and
you
--
I
know
!
But
look
*NL*
at

*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
to
Uriah
,
pale
and
glowering
in
a
corner
,
evidently
very
much
*NL*
out
in
his
calculations
,
and
taken
by
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
my
torturer
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Before
him
I
have
step
by
step

abandoned

reputation

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Uriah
,
with
a
sulky
,
hurried
,
*NL*
defeated
air
of
compromise
.
``
Do
n't

*NL*
*NL*

looked

*NL*
``
You

cried
Uriah

*NL*
with
his
long
fore-finger
pointing
towards
me

``

Mr.

with
a
desperate

*NL*
``

continuing
to
warn

*NL*
``

Mr.

wringing
his

Weak
indulgence

ruined

*NL*
have
infected
everything
I
touched
.
I
have
brought
misery
on
what
I
*NL*
dearly
love
,
I
know
--
_
You
_
know
!
I
thought
it
possible
that
I
could
*NL*
truly
love
one
creature
in
the
world
,
and
not
love
the
rest
;
I
thought
*NL*
it
possible
that
I
could
truly
mourn
for
one
creature
gone
out
of
the
*NL*
world
,
and
not
have
some
part
in
the
grief
of
all
who
mourned
.
Thus
the
*NL*
lessons
of
my
life
have
been
perverted
!
I
have
preyed
on
my
own
morbid
*NL*
coward
heart
,
and
it
has
preyed
on
me
.
Sordid
in
my
grief
,
sordid
in
my
*NL*
love
,
sordid
in
my
miserable
escape
from
the
darker
side
of
both
,
oh
see
*NL*
the
ruin
I
am
,
and
hate
me
,
shun
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
weakly
sobbed
.
The
excitement
into
which
he
*NL*
had
been
roused
was
leaving
him
.
Uriah
came
out
of
his
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
all
I
have
done
,
in
my
fatuity
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
*NL*
putting
out
his
hands
,
as
if
to
deprecate
my
condemnation
.
''
_
He
_
knows
*NL*
best
,
''
meaning
Uriah
Heep
,
``
for
he
has
always
been
at
my
elbow
,
*NL*
whispering
me
.
You
see
the
millstone
that
he
is
about
my
neck
.
You
find
*NL*
him
in
my
house
,
you
find
him
in
my
business
.
You
heard
him
,
but
a
*NL*
little
time
ago
.
What
need
have
I
to
say
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
need
to
say
so
much
,
nor
half
so
much
,
nor
anything
at
*NL*
all

''
observed
Uriah
,
half
defiant
,
and
half
fawning
.
``
You
would
n't
have
*NL*
took
it
up
so
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
wine

You
'll
think
better
of
it
*NL*
to-morrow
,
sir
.
If
I
have
said
too
much
,
or
more
than
I
meant
,
what
of
*NL*
it
?
I
have
n't
stood
by
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
Agnes
,
gliding
in
,
without
a
vestige
of
colour
in
*NL*
her
face
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
steadily
said
,
``
Papa
,
you
are
*NL*
not
well
.
Come
with
me
!
''
He
laid
his
head
upon
her
shoulder
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
oppressed
with
heavy
shame
,
and
went
out
with
her
.
Her
eyes
met
*NL*
mine
for
but
an
instant
,
yet
I
saw
how
much
she
knew
of
what
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
expect
he
'd
cut
up
so
rough
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
``
But
it
's
nothing
.
I
'll
be
friends
with
him
to-morrow
.
It
's
for
his
*NL*
good
.
I
'm
umbly
anxious
for
his
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
no
answer
,
and
went
upstairs
into
the
quiet
room
where
Agnes
*NL*
had
so
often
sat
beside
me
at
my
books
.
Nobody
came
near
me
until
late
*NL*
at
night
.
I
took
up
a
book
,
and
tried
to
read
.
I
heard
the
clocks
strike
*NL*
twelve
,
and
was
still
reading
,
without
knowing
what
I
read
,
when
Agnes
*NL*
touched
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
going
early
in
the
morning
,
Trotwood
.
Let
us
say
good
bye
,
*NL*
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
weeping
,
but
her
face
then
was
so
calm
and
beautiful
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
bless
you
!
''
she
said
,
giving
me
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Agnes
!
''
I
returned
,
``
I
see
you
ask
me
not
to
speak
of
*NL*
to-night

but
is
there
nothing
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
God
to

she
replied

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can

nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
make
mine
so

she
replied
.
``
Dear
Trotwood

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

I
said
,
``
it
is
presumptuous

goodness

how
much

You

never

yourself

a
mistaken

duty

*NL*
Agnes

''
*NL*
*NL*
More
agitated
for
a
moment
than
I
had
ever
seen
her
,
she
took
her
hand
*NL*
from
me
,
and
moved
a
step
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
you
have
no
such
thought
,
dear
Agnes
!
Much
more
than
sister

Think
*NL*
of
the
priceless
gift
of
such
a
heart
as
yours
,
of
such
a
love
as
*NL*
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
long
,
long
afterwards
,
I
saw
that
face
rise
up
before
me
,
with
its
*NL*
momentary
look
,
not
wondering
,
not
accusing
,
not
regretting
.
Oh
,
long
,
*NL*
long
afterwards
,
I
saw
that
look
subside
,
as
it
did
now
,
into
the
lovely
*NL*
smile
,
with
which
she
told
me
she
had
no
fear
for
herself
--
I
need
have
*NL*
none
for
her
--
and
parted
from
me
by
the
name
of
Brother
,
and
was
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dark
in
the
morning
,
when
I
got
upon
the
coach
at
the
inn
door
.
*NL*
The
day
was
just
breaking
when
we
were
about
to
start
,
and
then
,
as
I
*NL*
sat
thinking
of
her
,
came
struggling
up
the
coach
side
,
through
the
*NL*
mingled
day
and
night
,
Uriah
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
!
''
said
he
,
in
a
croaking
whisper
,
as
he
hung
by
the
iron
on
*NL*
the
roof
,
``
I
thought
you
'd
be
glad
to
hear
before
you
went
off
,
that
*NL*
there
are
no
squares
broke
between
us
.
I
've
been
into
his
room
already
,
*NL*
and
we
've
made
it
all
smooth
.
Why
,
though
I
'm
umble
,
I
'm
useful
to
him
,
*NL*
you
know
;
and
he
understands
his
interest
when
he
is
n't
in
liquor
!
What
*NL*
an
agreeable
man
he
is
,
after
all
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
obliged
myself
to
say
that
I
was
glad
he
had
made
his
apology
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
to
be
sure
!
''
said
Uriah
.
``
When
a
person
's
umble
,
you
know
,
what
's
*NL*
an
apology
?
So
easy
!
I
say
!
I
suppose
,
''
with
a
jerk
,
``
you
have
sometimes
*NL*
plucked
a
pear
before
it
was
ripe
,
Master
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
have
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
did
that
last
night
,
''
said
Uriah
;
``
but
it
'll
ripen
yet
!
It
only
*NL*
wants
attending
to
.
I
can
wait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Profuse
in
his
farewells
,
he
got
down
again
as
the
coachman
got
up
.
For
*NL*
anything
I
know
,
he
was
eating
something
to
keep
the
raw
morning
air
*NL*
out
;
but
,
he
made
motions
with
his
mouth
as
if
the
pear
were
ripe
*NL*
already
,
and
he
were
smacking
his
lips
over
it

CHAPTER
XL
.
*NL*
*NL*
THE
WANDERER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
very
serious
conversation
in
Buckingham
Street
that
night
,
*NL*
about
the
domestic
occurrences
I
have
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
.
My
*NL*
aunt
was
deeply
interested
in
them
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
*NL*
her
arms
folded
,
for
more
than
two
hours
afterwards
.
Whenever
she
was
*NL*
particularly
discomposed
,
she
always
performed
one
of
these
pedestrian
*NL*
feats
;
and
the
amount
of
her
discomposure
might
always
be
estimated
by
*NL*
the
duration
of
her
walk
.
On
this
occasion
she
was
so
much
disturbed
in
*NL*
mind
as
to
find
it
necessary
to
open
the
bed-room
door
,
and
make
a
*NL*
course
for
herself
,
comprising
the
full
extent
of
the
bed-rooms
from
*NL*
wall
to
wall
;
and
while
Mr.
Dick
and
I
sat
quietly
by
the
fire
,
she
kept
*NL*
passing
in
and
out
,
along
this
measured
track
,
at
an
unchanging
pace
,
*NL*
with
the
regularity
of
a
clock-pendulum
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
aunt
and
I
were
left
to
ourselves
by
Mr.
Dick
's
going
out
to
*NL*
bed
,
I
sat
down
to
write
my
letter
to
the
two
old
ladies
.
By
that
time
*NL*
she
was
tired
of
walking
,
and
sat
by
the
fire
with
her
dress
tucked
up
*NL*
as
usual
.
But
instead
of
sitting
in
her
usual
manner
,
holding
her
glass
*NL*
upon
her
knee
,
she
suffered
it
to
stand
neglected
on
the
chimney-piece
;
*NL*
and
,
resting
her
left
elbow
on
her
right
arm
,
and
her
chin
on
her
left
*NL*
hand
,
looked
thoughtfully
at
me
.
As
often
as
I
raised
my
eyes
from
what
*NL*
I
was
about
,
I
met
hers
.
``
I
am
in
the
lovingest
of
tempers
,
my
dear
,
''
*NL*
she
would
assure
me
with
a
nod
,
``
but
I
am
fidgetted
and
sorry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
too
busy
to
observe
,
until
after
she
was
gone
to
bed
,
that
*NL*
she
had
left
her
night-mixture
,
as
she
always
called
it
,
untasted
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
She
came
to
her
door
,
with
even
more
than
her
usual
*NL*
affection
of
manner
,
when
I
knocked
to
acquaint
her
with
this
discovery
;
*NL*
but
only
said
,
``
I
have
not
the
heart
to
take
it
,
Trot
,
to-night
,
''
and
*NL*
shook
her
head
,
and
went
in
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
my
letter
to
the
two
old
ladies
,
in
the
morning
,
and
approved
*NL*
of
it
.
I
posted
it
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
then
,
but
wait
,
as
patiently
*NL*
as
I
could
,
for
the
reply
.
I
was
still
in
this
state
of
expectation
,
and
*NL*
had
been
,
for
nearly
a
week
;
when
I
left
the
Doctor
's
one
snowy
night
,
*NL*
to
walk
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
a
bitter
day
,
and
a
cutting
north-east
wind
had
blown
for
*NL*
some
time
.
The
wind
had
gone
down
with
the
light
,
and
so
the
snow
had
*NL*
come
on
.
It
was
a
heavy
,
settled
fall
,
I
recollect
,
in
great
flakes
;
and
*NL*
it
lay
thick
.
The
noise
of
wheels
and
tread
of
people
were
as
hushed
,
as
*NL*
if
the
streets
had
been
strewn
that
depth
with
feathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
shortest
way
home
,
--
and
I
naturally
took
the
shortest
way
on
such
a
*NL*
night
--
was
through
Saint
Martin
's
Lane
.
Now
,
the
church
which
gives
its
*NL*
name
to
the
lane
,
stood
in
a
less
free
situation
at
that
time
;
there
*NL*
being
no
open
space
before
it
,
and
the
lane
winding
down
to
the
Strand
.
*NL*
As
I
passed
the
steps
of
the
portico
,
I
encountered
,
at
the
corner
,
a
*NL*
woman
's
face
.
It
looked
in
mine
,
passed
across
the
narrow
lane
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
I
knew
it
.
I
had
seen
it
somewhere
.
But
I
could
not
*NL*
remember
where
.
I
had
some
association
with
it
,
that
struck
upon
my
*NL*
heart
directly
;
but
I
was
thinking
of
anything
else
when
it
came
upon
*NL*
me
,
and
was
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
steps
of
the
church
,
there
was
the
stooping
figure
of
a
man
,
who
*NL*
had
put
down
some
burden
on
the
smooth
snow
,
to
adjust
it
;
my
seeing
the
*NL*
face
,
and
my
seeing
him
,
were
simultaneous
.
I
do
n't
think
I
had
stopped
*NL*
in
my
surprise
;
but
,
in
any
case
,
as
I
went
on
,
he
rose
,
turned
,
and
*NL*
came
down
towards
me
.
I
stood
face
to
face
with
Mr.
Peggotty
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
remembered
the
woman
.
It
was
Martha
,
to
whom
Emily
had
given
the
*NL*
money
that
night
in
the
kitchen
.
Martha
Endell
--
side
by
side
with
whom
,
*NL*
he
would
not
have
seen
his
dear
niece
,
Ham
had
told
me
,
for
all
the
*NL*
treasures
wrecked
in
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shook
hands
heartily
.
At
first
neither
of
us
could
speak
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
''
he
said
,
griping
me
tight
,
``
it
do
my
art
good
to
see
you
,
*NL*
sir
.
Well
met
,
well
met
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
met
,
my
dear
old
friend
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
my
thowts
o
'
coming
to
make
inquiration
for
you
,
sir
,
to-night
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
but
knowing
as
your
aunt
was
living
along
wi
'
you
--
for
I
've
*NL*
been
down
yonder
--
Yarmouth
way
--
I
was
afeerd
it
was
too
late
.
I
should
*NL*
have
come
early
in
the
morning
,
sir
,
afore
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
,
patiently
shaking
his
head
,
``
I
'm
away
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
going
now
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
replied
,
shaking
the
snow
out
of
his
long
hair
,
``
I
was
a
*NL*
going
to
turn
in
somewheers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
those
days
there
was
a
side-entrance
to
the
stable-yard
of
the
Golden
*NL*
Cross
,
the
inn
so
memorable
to
me
in
connexion
with
his
misfortune
,
*NL*
nearly
opposite
to
where
we
stood
.
I
pointed
out
the
gateway
,
put
my
arm
*NL*
through
his
,
and
we
went
across
.
Two
or
three
public-rooms
opened
out
of
*NL*
the
stable-yard
;
and
looking
into
one
of
them
,
and
finding
it
empty
,
and
*NL*
a
good
fire
burning
,
I
took
him
in
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
saw
him
in
the
light
,
I
observed
,
not
only
that
his
hair
was
long
*NL*
and
ragged
,
but
that
his
face
was
burnt
dark
by
the
sun
.
He
was
greyer
,
*NL*
the
lines
in
his
face
and
forehead
were
deeper
,
and
he
had
every
*NL*
appearance
of
having
toiled
and
wandered
through
all
varieties
of
*NL*
weather
;
but
he
looked
very
strong
,
and
like
a
man
upheld
by
*NL*
stedfastness
of
purpose
,
whom
nothing
could
tire
out
.
He
shook
the
snow
*NL*
from
his
hat
and
clothes
,
and
brushed
it
away
from
his
face
,
while
I
was
*NL*
inwardly
making
these
remarks
.
As
he
sate
down
opposite
to
me
at
a
*NL*
table
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
,
he
put
out
his
*NL*
rough
hand
again
,
and
grasped
mine
warmly
.

*NL*
I
rang
the
bell
for
something
hot
to

He
would
have
nothing
*NL*
younger
than
ale
;
and
while
it
was
being
brought
,
and
being
warmed
at
*NL*
the
fire

he
sat
thinking

There
was
a
fine

massive
gravity
in
his

face

I
did
not
venture
to
disturb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When

was

he
said
,
lifting
up
his
head
soon
after
we
were
*NL*
left
alone
,
``
she
used

to

thowt

think
on

so
much

I
doe

see
,

maybe
she
*NL*
believed

or
hoped

he
had
drifted
out

parts

where
the
flowers
*NL*
is
always
a
blowing

the
country
bright

*NL*
``
It
is
likely

have
been

I
replied

*NL*
``

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
the

move

the
snow
drift
in

I
saw

move

softly
interpose

Then
I

they

told

that

among

the
poor

I
found

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Martha
at
the
door
.
I
saw
her
haggard
,
listening
face
distinctly
.
*NL*
My
dread
was
lest
he
should
turn
his
head
,
and
see
her
too

*NL*
*NL*
``

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Overpowered
by
sudden
grief
,
he
sobbed
aloud
.
I
laid
my
trembling
hand
*NL*
upon
the
hand
he
put
before
his
face
.
``
Thankee

he
said
,
``
do
n't
*NL*
take
no
notice

*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
little
while
he
took
his
hand
away
and
put
it
in
his
breast
,
*NL*
and
went
on
with
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
often
walked

he
said
,
``
in

said

they
always
seemed
to
understand

answered
*NL*
pleasant

At
last
I
come
to
the
sea

It
war
n't
hard
,
you
may
suppose
,
*NL*
for
a
seafaring
man
like
me
to
work
his
way
over
to
Italy
.
When
I
got
*NL*
theer
,
I
wandered
on
as
I
had
done
afore
.
The
people
was
just
as
good
to
*NL*
me
,
and
I
should
have
gone
from
town
to
town
,
maybe
the
country
through
,
*NL*
but
that
I
got
news
of
her
being
seen
among
them
Swiss
mountains
yonder

*NL*
One
as
know

'em
there

all
three

told
me
how
they

travelled

where
they
was

made
for

Ever
so
fur

I
went

ever

fur

mountains
seemed
*NL*
to
shift
away
from
me
.
But
I
come
up
with
'em
,
and
I
crossed
'em
.
When
I
*NL*
got
nigh
the
place
as
I
had
been
told
of
,
I
began
to
think
within
my
own
*NL*
self
,
`
What
shall
I
do
when
I
see
her
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
listening
face
,
insensible
to
the
inclement
night
,
still
drooped
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
the
hands
begged
me
--
prayed
me
--
not
to
cast
it
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
doubted
her

said
Mr.

``
No

I
bought
a
country
dress
to
put

upon

I
know

that

once
found

she
would
walk
beside

over

stony

go
where

never

leave

To

that

off

on

From
some
pocket
in

took
out

with

a

small

me
--
justly
hard
,
I
know

but
,
*NL*
Listen
,
if
it
is
hard
,
dear
,
ask
him
I
have
wronged
the
most
--
him
*NL*
whose
wife
I
was
to
have
been
--
before
you
quite
decide
against
my
*NL*
poor
poor
prayer
!
If
he
should
be
so
compassionate
as
to
say
that
*NL*
you
might
write
something
for
me
to
read
--
I
think
he
would
,
oh
,
I
*NL*
think
he
would
,
if
you
would
only
ask
him
,
for
he
always
was
so
*NL*
brave
and
so
forgiving
--
tell
him
then
-LRB-
but
not
else
-RRB-
,
that
when
*NL*
I
hear
the
wind
blowing
at
night
,
I
feel
as
if
it
was
passing
*NL*
angrily
from
seeing
him
and
uncle
,
and
was
going
up
to
God
against
*NL*
me
.
Tell
him
that
if
I
was
to
die
to-morrow
-LRB-
and
oh
,
if
I
was
fit
,
*NL*
I
would
be
so
glad
to
die
!
-RRB-
I
would
bless
him
and
uncle
with
my
*NL*
last
words
,
and
pray
for
his
happy
home
with
my
last
breath
!

Some
money
was
inclosed
in
this
letter
also
.
Five
pounds
.
It
was
*NL*
untouched
like
the
previous
sum
,
and
he
refolded
it
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
Detailed
instructions
were
added
relative
to
the
address
of
a
reply
,
*NL*
which
,
although
they
betrayed
the
intervention
of
several
hands
,
and
*NL*
made
it
difficult
to
arrive
at
any
very
probable
conclusion
in
reference
*NL*
to
her
place
of
concealment
,
made
it
at
least
not
unlikely
that
she
had
*NL*
written
from
that
spot
where
she
was
stated
to
have
been
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
answer
was
sent

''
I
inquired
of
Mr.
Peggotty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missis

''
he
returned
,
``
not
being
a
good
scholar
,
sir

Ham
*NL*
kindly
drawed
it
out
,
and
she
made
a
copy
on
it
.
They
told
her
I
was
*NL*
gone
to
seek
her
,
and
what
my
parting
words
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
another

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

said
Mr.

,
unfolding
it
a
little

``

*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
it
to
me
.
It
was
a
town
on
the
Upper
Rhine
.
He
had
found
out
,
*NL*
at
Yarmouth
,
some
foreign
dealers
who
knew
that
country
,
and
they
had
*NL*
drawn
him
a
rude
map
on
paper
,
which
he
could
very
well
understand
.
He
*NL*
laid
it
between
us
on
the
table
;
and
,
with
his
chin
resting
on
one
hand
,
*NL*
tracked
his
course
upon
it
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
how
Ham
was
?
He
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
works
,
''
he
said
,
``
as
bold
as
a

can

His

his
is
ready

He
's
*NL*
never

But
my

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

in
a
solemn
*NL*
whisper
--
``

*NL*
*NL*
He
gathered
up
the
letters
thoughtfully
,
smoothing
them
with
his
hand
;
*NL*
put
them
into
their
little
bundle
;
and
placed
it
tenderly
in
his
breast
*NL*
again
.
The
face
was
gone
from
the
door
.
I
still
saw
the
snow
drifting
*NL*
in
;
but
nothing
else
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!

he
said
,
looking
to
his
bag
,
``

seen

*NL*
You
have
seen

putting
his
hand
on
where
the
little
*NL*
packet
lay
;
``
all

to

*NL*
believe

must
come

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
and
I
rose
too
;
we
grasped
each
other
by
the
hand
again
,
before
*NL*
going
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
go
ten

he
said
,
``

doe

maybe
she
'll
come

sometime
,
as
her
loving
*NL*
uncle
only
ended
his
search
for
her
when
he
ended
his
life
;
and
if
I
*NL*
know
her
,
even
that
will
turn
her
home
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
went
out
into
the
rigorous
night
,
I
saw
the
lonely
figure
flit
*NL*
away
before
us
.
I
turned
him
hastily
on
some
pretence
,
and
held
him
in
*NL*
conversation
until
it
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
of
a
traveller
's
house
on
the
Dover
road
,
where
he
knew
he
*NL*
could
find
a
clean
,
plain
lodging
for
the
night
.
I
went
with
him
over
*NL*
Westminster
Bridge
,
and
parted
from
him
on
the
Surrey
shore
.
Everything
*NL*
seemed
,
to
my
imagination
,
to
be
hushed
in
reverence
for
him
,
as
he
*NL*
resumed
his
solitary
journey
through
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
to
the
inn
yard
,
and
,
impressed
by
my
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
face
,
looked
awfully
around
for
it
.
It
was
not
there
.
The
snow
had
*NL*
covered
our
late
footprints
;
my
new
track
was
the
only
one
to
be
seen
;
*NL*
and
even
that
began
to
die
away
-LRB-
it
snowed
so
fast
-RRB-
as
I
looked
back
*NL*
over
my
shoulder

CHAPTER
XLI
.
*NL*
*NL*
DORA
'S
AUNTS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
an
answer
came
from
the
two
old
ladies
.
They
presented
their
*NL*
compliments
to
Mr.
Copperfield
,
and
informed
him
that
they
had
given
his
*NL*
letter
their
best
consideration
,
``
with
a
view
to
the
happiness
of
both
*NL*
parties
''
--
which
I
thought
rather
an
alarming
expression
,
not
only
*NL*
because
of
the
use
they
had
made
of
it
in
relation
to
the
family
*NL*
difference
before-mentioned
,
but
because
I
had
-LRB-
and
have
all
my
life
-RRB-
*NL*
observed
that
conventional
phrases
are
a
sort
of
fireworks
,
easily
let
*NL*
off
,
and
liable
to
take
a
great
variety
of
shapes
and
colors
not
at
all
*NL*
suggested
by
their
original
form
.
The
Misses
Spenlow
added
that
they
*NL*
begged
to
forbear
expressing
,
``
through
the
medium
of
correspondence
,
''
an
*NL*
opinion
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Copperfield
's
communication
;
but
that
if
*NL*
Mr.
Copperfield
would
do
them
the
favor
to
call
,
upon
a
certain
day
,
*NL*
-LRB-
accompanied
,
if
he
thought
proper
,
by
a
confidential
friend
-RRB-
,
they
*NL*
would
be
happy
to
hold
some
conversation
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
favor
,
Mr.
Copperfield
immediately
replied
,
with
his
respectful
*NL*
compliments
,
that
he
would
have
the
honor
of
waiting
on
the
Misses
*NL*
Spenlow
,
at
the
time
appointed
;
accompanied
,
in
accordance
with
their
*NL*
kind
permission
,
by
his
friend
Mr.
Thomas
Traddles
of
the
Inner
Temple
.
*NL*
Having
dispatched
which
missive
,
Mr.
Copperfield
fell
into
a
condition
*NL*
of
strong
nervous
agitation
;
and
so
remained
until
the
day
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
augmentation
of
my
uneasiness
to
be
bereaved
,
at
this
*NL*
eventful
crisis
,
of
the
inestimable
services
of
Miss
Mills
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Mills
,
who
was
always
doing
something
or
other
to
annoy
me
--
or
I
felt
as
*NL*
if
he
were
,
which
was
the
same
thing
--
had
brought
his
conduct
to
a
*NL*
climax
,
by
taking
it
into
his
head
that
he
would
go
to
India
.
Why
should
*NL*
he
go
to
India
,
except
to
harass
me
?
To
be
sure
he
had
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
any
other
part
of
the
world
,
and
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
that
*NL*
part
;
being
entirely
in
the
India
trade
,
whatever
that
was
-LRB-
I
had
*NL*
floating
dreams
myself
concerning
golden
shawls
and
elephant
's
teeth
-RRB-
;
*NL*
having
been
at
Calcutta
in
his
youth
;
and
designing
now
to
go
out
there
*NL*
again
,
in
the
capacity
of
resident
partner
.
But
this
was
nothing
to
me
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
so
much
to
him
that
for
India
he
was
bound
,
and
Julia
*NL*
with
him
;
and
Julia
went
into
the
country
to
take
leave
of
her
*NL*
relations
;
and
the
house
was
put
into
a
perfect
suit
of
bills
,
*NL*
announcing
that
it
was
to
be
let
or
sold
,
and
that
the
furniture
-LRB-
Mangle
*NL*
and
all
-RRB-
was
to
be
taken
at
a
valuation
.
So
,
here
was
another
earthquake
*NL*
of
which
I
became
the
sport
,
before
I
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
*NL*
its
predecessor
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
several
minds
how
to
dress
myself
on
the
important
day
;
being
*NL*
divided
between
my
desire
to
appear
to
advantage
,
and
my
apprehensions
*NL*
of
putting
on
anything
that
might
impair
my
severely
practical
*NL*
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
Misses
Spenlow
.
I
endeavoured
to
hit
a
*NL*
happy
medium
between
these
two
extremes
;
my
aunt
approved
the
result
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Dick
threw
one
of
his
shoes
after
Traddles
and
me
,
for
luck
,
*NL*
as
we
went
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excellent
fellow
as
I
knew
Traddles
to
be
,
and
warmly
attached
to
him
*NL*
as
I
was
,
I
could
not
help
wishing
,
on
that
delicate
occasion
,
that
he
*NL*
had
never
contracted
the
habit
of
brushing
his
hair
so
very
upright
.
*NL*
It
gave
him
a
surprised
look
--
not
to
say
a
hearth-broomy
kind
of
*NL*
expression
--
which
,
my
apprehensions
whispered
,
might
be
fatal
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
liberty
of
mentioning
it
to
Traddles
,
as
we
were
walking
to
*NL*
Putney
;
and
saying
that
if
he
_
would
_
smooth
it
down
a
little
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Traddles
,
lifting
off
his
hat
,
and
rubbing
*NL*
his
hair
all
kinds
of
ways
,
``
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
.
But
*NL*
it
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
be
smoothed
down
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
Nothing
will
induce
it
.
If
I
was
to
carry
a
*NL*
half-hundred-weight
upon
it
,
all
the
way
to
Putney
,
it
would
be
up
*NL*
again
the
moment
the
weight
was
taken
off
.
You
have
no
idea
what
*NL*
obstinate
hair
mine
is
,
Copperfield
.
I
am
quite
a
fretful
porcupine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
little
disappointed
,
I
must
confess
,
but
thoroughly
charmed
by
*NL*
his
good-nature
too
.
I
told
him
how
I
esteemed
his
good-nature
;
and
said
*NL*
that
his
hair
must
have
taken
all
the
obstinacy
out
of
his
character
,
*NL*
for
_
he
_
had
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
returned
Traddles
,
laughing
,
``
I
assure
you
,
it
's
quite
an
old
*NL*
story
,
my
unfortunate
hair
.
My
uncle
's
wife
could
n't
bear
it
.
She
said
*NL*
it
exasperated
her
.
It
stood
very
much
in
my
way
,
too
,
when
I
first
fell
*NL*
in
love
with
Sophy
.
Very
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
object
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
She
_
did
n't
,
''
rejoined
Traddles
;
``
but
her
eldest
sister
--
the
one
*NL*
that
's
the
Beauty
--
quite
made
game
of
it
,
I
understand
.
In
fact
,
all
the
*NL*
sisters
laugh
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreeable
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Traddles
with
perfect
innocence
,
``
it
's
a
joke
for
us
.
*NL*
They
pretend
that
Sophy
has
a
lock
of
it
in
her
desk
,
and
is
obliged
to
*NL*
shut
it
in
a
clasped
book
,
to
keep
it
down
.
We
laugh
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By-the-bye
,
my
dear
Traddles
,
''
said
I
,
``
your
experience
may
suggest
*NL*
something
to
me
.
When
you
became
engaged
to
the
young
lady
whom
you
have
*NL*
just
mentioned
,
did
you
make
a
regular
proposal
to
her
family
?
Was
there
*NL*
anything
like
--
what
we
are
going
through
to-day
,
for
instance
?
''
I
added
,
*NL*
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
replied
Traddles
,
on
whose
attentive
face
a
thoughtful
shade
had

stolen
,
``
it
was
rather
a
painful
transaction
,
Copperfield
,
in
my
case
.
*NL*
You
see
,
Sophy
being
of
so
much
use
in
the
family
,
none
of
them
could
*NL*
endure
the
thought
of
her
ever
being
married
.
Indeed
,
they
had
quite
*NL*
settled
among
themselves
that
she
never
was
to
be
married
,
and
they
*NL*
called
her
the
old
maid
.
Accordingly
,
when
I
mentioned
it
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
precaution
,
to
Mrs.
Crewler
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mamma
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mamma
,
''
said
Traddles
--
``
Reverend
Horace
Crewler
--
when
I
mentioned
*NL*
it
with
every
possible
precaution
to
Mrs.
Crewler
,
the
effect
upon
her
*NL*
was
such
that
she
gave
a
scream
and
became
insensible
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
approach
the
subject
again
,
for
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
at
last
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
Reverend

did
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
He
is
an
excellent
man
,
*NL*
most
exemplary
in
every
way
;
and
he
pointed
out
to
her
that
she
ought
,
*NL*
as
a
Christian
,
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
sacrifice
-LRB-
especially
as
it
*NL*
was
so
uncertain
-RRB-
,
and
to
bear
no
uncharitable
feeling
towards
me
.
As
to
*NL*
myself
,
Copperfield
,
I
give
you
my
word
,
I
felt
a
perfect
bird
of
prey
*NL*
towards
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sisters
took
your
part
,
I
hope
,
Traddles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
ca
n't
say
they
did
,
''
he
returned
.
``
When
we
had
comparatively
*NL*
reconciled
Mrs.
Crewler
to
it
,
we
had
to
break
it
to
Sarah
.
You
*NL*
recollect
my
mentioning
Sarah
,
as
the
one
that
has
something
the
matter
*NL*
with
her
spine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
clenched
both
her
hands
,
''
said
Traddles
,
looking
at
me
in
dismay
;
*NL*
``
shut
her
eyes
;
turned
lead-color
;
became
perfectly
stiff
;
and
took
*NL*
nothing
for
two
days
,
but
toast-and-water
administered
with
a
teaspoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
very
unpleasant
girl
,
Traddles
!
''
I
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Copperfield
!
''
said
Traddles
.
``
She
is
a
very
*NL*
charming
girl
,
but
she
has
a
great
deal
of
feeling
.
In
fact
,
they
all
*NL*
have
.
Sophy
told
me
afterwards
,
that
the
self-reproach
she
underwent
*NL*
while
she
was
in
attendance
upon
Sarah
,
no
words
could
describe
.
I
know
*NL*
it
must
have
been
severe
,
by
my
own
feelings
,
Copperfield
;
which
were
*NL*
like
a
criminal
's
.
After
Sarah
was
restored
,
we
still
had
to
break
it
to
*NL*
the
other
eight
;
and
it
produced
various
effects
upon
them
of
a
most
*NL*
pathetic
nature
.
The
two
little
ones
,
whom
Sophy
educates
,
have
only
*NL*
just
left
off
de-testing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
they
are
all
reconciled
to
it
now
,
I
hope
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
--
yes
,
I
should
say
they
were
,
on
the
whole
,
resigned
to
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Traddles
,
doubtfully
.
``
The
fact
is
,
we
avoid
mentioning
the
subject
;
and
*NL*
my
unsettled
prospects
and
indifferent
circumstances
are
a
great
*NL*
consolation
to
them
.
There
will
be
a
deplorable
scene
,
whenever
we
are
*NL*
married
.
It
will
be
much
more
like
a
funeral
,
than
a
wedding
.
And
*NL*
they
'll
all
hate
me
for
taking
her
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
honest
face
,
as
he
looked
at
me
with
a
serio-comic
shake
of
his
*NL*
head
,
impresses
me
more
in
the
remembrance
than
it
did
in
the
reality
,
*NL*
for
I
was
by
this
time
in
a
state
of
such
excessive
trepidation
and
*NL*
wandering
of
mind
,
as
to
be
quite
unable
to
fix
my
attention
on
*NL*
anything
.
On
our
approaching
the
house
where
the
Misses
Spenlow
lived
,
I
*NL*
was
at
such
a
discount
in
respect
of
my
personal
looks
and
presence
of
*NL*
mind
,
that
Traddles
proposed
a
gentle
stimulant
in
the
form
of
a
glass
*NL*
of
ale
.
This
having
been
administered
at
a
neighbouring
public-house
,
he
*NL*
conducted
me
,
with
tottering
steps
,
to
the
Misses
Spenlow
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
vague
sensation
of
being
,
as
it
were
,
on
view
,
when
the
maid
*NL*
opened
it
;
and
of
wavering
,
somehow
,
across
a
hall
with
a
weather-glass
*NL*
in
it
,
into
a
quiet
little
drawing-room
on
the
ground-floor
,
commanding
*NL*
a
neat
garden
.
Also
of
sitting
down
here
,
on
a
sofa
,
and
seeing
*NL*
Traddles
's
hair
start
up
,
now
his
hat
was
removed
,
like
one
of
those
*NL*
obtrusive
little
figures
made
of
springs
,
that
fly
out
of
fictitious
*NL*
snuff-boxes
when
the
lid
is
taken
off
.
Also
of
hearing
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
clock
ticking
away
on
the
chimney-piece
,
and
trying
to
make
it
keep
time
*NL*
to
the
jerking
of
my
heart
,
--
which
it
would
n't
.
Also
of
looking
round
*NL*
the
room
for
any
sign
of
Dora
,
and
seeing
none
.
Also
of
thinking
that
*NL*
Jip
once
barked
in
the
distance
,
and
was
instantly
choked
by
somebody
.
*NL*
Ultimately
I
found
myself
backing
Traddles
into
the
fire-place
,
and
*NL*
bowing
in
great
confusion
to
two
dry
little
elderly
ladies
,
dressed
in
*NL*
black
,
and
each
looking
wonderfully
like
a
preparation
in
chip
or
tan
of
*NL*
the
late
Mr.
Spenlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
''
said
one
of
the
two
little
ladies
,
``
be
seated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
done
tumbling
over
Traddles
,
and
had
sat
upon
something
*NL*
which
was
not
a
cat
--
my
first
seat
was
--
I
so
far
recovered
my
sight
,
*NL*
as
to
perceive
that
Mr.
Spenlow
had
evidently
been
the
youngest
of
the
*NL*
family
;
that
there
was
a
disparity
of
six
or
eight
years
between
the
*NL*
two
sisters
;
and
that
the
younger
appeared
to
be
the
manager
of
the
*NL*
conference
,
inasmuch
as
she
had
my
letter
in
her
hand
--
so
familiar
as
*NL*
it
looked
to
me
,
and
yet
so
odd
!
--
and
was
referring
to
it
through
an
*NL*
eye-glass
.
They
were
dressed
alike
,
but
this
sister
wore
her
dress
*NL*
with
a
more
youthful
air
than
the
other
;
and
perhaps
had
a
trifle
more
*NL*
frill
,
or
tucker
,
or
brooch
,
or
bracelet
,
or
some
little
thing
of
that
*NL*
kind
,
which
made
her
look
more
lively
.
They
were
both
upright
in
their
*NL*
carriage
,
formal
,
precise
,
composed
,
and
quiet
.
The
sister
who
had
not
*NL*
my
letter
,
had
her
arms
crossed
on
her
breast
,
and
resting
on
each
*NL*
other
,
like
an
Idol
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
I
believe
,
''
said
the
sister
who
had
got
my
letter
,
*NL*
addressing
herself
to
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
frightful
beginning
.
Traddles
had
to
indicate
that
I
was
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
and
I
had
to
lay
claim
to
myself
,
and
they
had
to
divest
*NL*
themselves
of
a
preconceived
opinion
that
Traddles
was
Mr.
Copperfield
,
*NL*
and
altogether
we
were
in
a
nice
condition
.
To
improve
it
,
we
all
*NL*
distinctly
heard
Jip
give
two
short
barks
,
and
receive
another
choke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
!
''
said
the
sister
with
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
something
--
bowed
,
I
suppose
--
and
was
all
attention
,
when
the
other
*NL*
sister
struck
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
Lavinia
,
''
said
she
,
``
being
conversant
with
matters
of
this
*NL*
nature
,
will
state
what
we
consider
most
calculated
to
promote
the
*NL*
happiness
of
both
parties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
discovered
afterwards
that
Miss
Lavinia
was
an
authority
in
affairs
of
*NL*
the
heart
,
by
reason
of
there
having
anciently
existed
a
certain
Mr.
*NL*
Pidger
,
who
played
short
whist
,
and
was
supposed
to
have
been
enamoured
*NL*
of
her
.
My
private
opinion
is
,
that
this
was
entirely
a
gratuitous
*NL*
assumption
,
and
that
Pidger
was
altogether
innocent
of
any
such
*NL*
sentiments
--
to
which
he
had
never
given
any
sort
of
expression
that
I
*NL*
could
ever
hear
of
.
Both
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
had
a
*NL*
superstition
,
however
,
that
he
would
have
declared
his
passion
,
if
he
*NL*
had
not
been
cut
short
in
his
youth
-LRB-
at
about
sixty
-RRB-
by
over-drinking
*NL*
his
constitution
,
and
overdoing
an
attempt
to
set
it
right
again
by
*NL*
swilling
Bath
water
.
They
had
a
lurking
suspicion
even
,
that
he
died
of
*NL*
secret
love
;
though
I
must
say
there
was
a
picture
of
him
in
the
house
*NL*
with
a
damask
nose
,
which
concealment
did
not
appear
to
have
ever
preyed
*NL*
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
not
,
''
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
``
enter
on
the
past
history
of
this
*NL*
matter
.
Our
poor
brother
Francis
's
death
has
cancelled
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
not
,
''
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
``
been
in
the
habit
of
frequent
*NL*
association
with
our
brother
Francis
;
but
there
was
no
decided
division
*NL*
or
disunion
between
us
.
Francis
took
his
road
;
we
took
ours
.
We
*NL*
considered
it
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
all
parties
that
it
should
*NL*
be
so
.
And
it
was
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
of
the
sisters
leaned
a
little
forward
to
speak
,
shook
her
head
*NL*
after
speaking
,
and
became
upright
again
when
silent
.
Miss
Clarissa
*NL*
never
moved
her
arms
.
She
sometimes
played
tunes
upon
them
with
her
*NL*
fingers
--
minuets
and
marches
I
should
think
--
but
never
moved
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
niece
's
position
,
or
supposed
position
,
is
much
changed
by
our
*NL*
brother
Francis
's
death
,
''
said
Miss
Lavinia
;
``
and
therefore
we
consider
*NL*
our
brother
's
opinions
as
regarded
her
position
as
being
changed
too
.
We
*NL*
have
no
reason
to
doubt
,
Mr.
Copperfield
,
that
you
are
a
young
gentleman
*NL*
possessed
of
good
qualities
and
honorable
character
;
or
that
you
have
an
*NL*
affection
--
or
are
fully
persuaded
that
you
have
an
affection
--
for
our
*NL*
niece

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
as
I
usually
did
whenever
I
had
a
chance
,
that
nobody
had
*NL*
ever
loved
anybody
else
as
I
loved
Dora
.
Traddles
came
to
my
assistance
*NL*
with
a
confirmatory
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
was
going
on
to
make
some
rejoinder
,
when
Miss
Clarissa
,
*NL*
who
appeared
to
be
incessantly
beset
by
a
desire
to
refer
to
her
brother
*NL*
Francis
,
struck
in
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Dora
's
mamma
,
''
she
said
,
``
when
she
married
our
brother
Francis
,
had
*NL*
at
once
said
that
there
was
not
room
for
the
family
at
the
dinner-table
,
*NL*
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
parties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Clarissa
,
''
said
Miss
Lavinia
.
``
Perhaps
we
need
n't
mind
that
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Lavinia
,
''
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
``
it
belongs
to
the
subject
.
With
*NL*
your
branch
of
the
subject
,
on
which
alone
you
are
competent
to
speak
,
I
*NL*
should
not
think
of
interfering
.
On
this
branch
of
the
subject
I
have
a
*NL*
voice
and
an
opinion
.
It
would
have
been
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
*NL*
parties
,
if
Dora
's
mamma
,
when
she
married
our
brother
Francis
,
had

mentioned
plainly
what
her
intentions
were
.
We
should
then
have
known
*NL*
what
we
had
to
expect
.
We
should
have
said
`
pray
do
not
invite
us

at

any

and
all
possibility
of
misunderstanding
would
have
been
*NL*
avoided

*NL*
*NL*
When
Miss
Clarissa
had
shaken
her
head
,
Miss
Lavinia
resumed
:
again
*NL*
referring
to
my
letter
through
her
eye-glass
.
They
both
had
little
*NL*
bright
round
twinkling
eyes
,
by
the
way
,
which
were
like
birds
'
eyes
.
*NL*
They
were
not
unlike
birds
,
altogether
;
having
a
sharp
,
brisk
,
sudden
*NL*
manner
,
and
a
little
short
,
spruce
way
of
adjusting
themselves
,
like
*NL*
canaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
,
as
I
have
said
,
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
permission

accepted
suitor
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

said
Miss
Clarissa
,
breaking
out
again
,
if
I
*NL*
may
call
anything
so
calm
a
breaking
out
,
``

surround

right

desire
had
we
to
object

None
,
I
am
sure
.
We
have
ever
*NL*
been
far
from
wishing
to
obtrude
ourselves
on
any
one
.
But
why
not
say
*NL*
so
?
Let
our
brother
Francis
and
his

Let
my

We
can
find
it

ourselves

hope

*NL*
*NL*
As
this
appeared
to
be
addressed
to
Traddles
and
me
,
both
Traddles
and
I
*NL*
made
some
sort
of
reply
.
Traddles
was
inaudible
.
I
think
I
observed
,
*NL*
myself
,
that
it
was
highly
creditable

all
concerned

I
do

in

meant

``

relieved

mind

Mr.
Copperfield
,
my
sister
Clarissa
and
I
have
been
very
careful
indeed
*NL*
in
considering
this
letter
;
and
we
have
not
considered
it
without
*NL*
finally
showing
it
to
our
niece
,
and
discussing
it
with
our
niece
.
We
*NL*
have
no
doubt
that
you
think
you
like
her
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
,
ma'am
,
''
I
rapturously
began
,
``
oh
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miss
Clarissa
giving
me
a
look
-LRB-
just
like
a
sharp
canary
-RRB-
,
as
*NL*
requesting
that
I
would
not
interrupt
the
oracle
,
I
begged
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Affection
,
''
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
glancing
at
her
sister
for
*NL*
corroboration
,
which
she
gave
in
the
form
of
a
little
nod
to
every
*NL*
clause
,
``
mature
affection
,
homage
,
devotion
,
does
not
easily
express
*NL*
itself
.
Its
voice
is
low
.
It
is
modest
and
retiring
,
it
lies
in
ambush
,
*NL*
waits
and
waits
.
Such
is
the
mature
fruit
.
Sometimes
a
life
glides
away
,
*NL*
and
finds
it
still
ripening
in
the
shade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
did
not
understand
then
that
this
was
an
allusion
to
her
*NL*
supposed
experience
of
the
stricken
Pidger
;
but
I
saw
,
from
the
gravity
*NL*
with
which
Miss
Clarissa
nodded
her
head
,
that
great
weight
was
attached
*NL*
to
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
light
--
for
I
call
them
,
in
comparison
with
such
sentiments
,
the
*NL*
light
--
inclinations
of
very
young
people
,
''
pursued
Miss
Lavinia
,
``
are
*NL*
dust
,
compared
to
rocks
.
It
is
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
knowing
*NL*
whether
they
are
likely
to
endure
or
have
any
real
foundation
,
that
my
*NL*
sister
Clarissa
and
myself
have
been
very
undecided
how
to
act
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
,
and
Mr.
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Traddles
,
''
said
my
friend
,
finding
himself
looked
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
pardon
.
Of
the
Inner
Temple
,
I
believe
?
''
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
*NL*
again
glancing
at
my
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
said
,
``
Exactly
so
,
''
and
became
pretty
red
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
although
I
had
not
received
any
express
encouragement
as
yet
,
I
*NL*
fancied
that
I
saw
in
the
two
little
sisters
,
and
particularly
in
Miss
*NL*
Lavinia
,
an
intensified
enjoyment
of
this
new
and
fruitful
subject
of
*NL*
domestic
interest
,
a
settling
down
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
a
disposition
*NL*
to
pet
it
,
in
which
there
was
a
good
bright
ray
of
hope
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
perceived
that
Miss
Lavinia
would
have
uncommon
satisfaction
in
*NL*
superintending
two
young
lovers
,
like
Dora
and
me
;
and
that
Miss
*NL*
Clarissa
would
have
hardly
less
satisfaction
in
seeing
her
superintend
*NL*
us
,
and
in
chiming
in
with
her
own
particular
department
of
the
subject
*NL*
whenever
that
impulse
was
strong
upon
her
.
This
gave
me
courage
to
*NL*
protest
most
vehemently
that
I
loved
Dora
better
than
I
could
tell
,
or
*NL*
any
one
believe
;
that
all
my
friends
knew
how
I
loved
her
;
that
my
aunt
,
*NL*
Agnes
,
Traddles
,
every
one
who
knew
me
,
knew
how
I
loved
her
,
and
how
*NL*
earnest
my
love
had
made
me
.
For
the
truth
of
this
,
I
appealed
to
*NL*
Traddles
.
And
Traddles
,
firing
up
as
if
he
were
plunging
into
a
*NL*
Parliamentary
Debate
,
really
did
come
out
nobly
:
confirming
me
in
good
*NL*
round
terms
,
and
in
a
plain
sensible
practical
manner
,
that
evidently
*NL*
made
a
favorable
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
,
if
I
may
presume
to
say
so
,
as
one
who
has
some
little
*NL*
experience
of
such
things
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
being
myself
engaged
to
a
*NL*
young
lady
--
one
of
ten
,
down
in
Devonshire
--
and
seeing
no
probability
,
*NL*
at
present
,
of
our
engagement
coming
to
a
termination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
able
to
confirm
what
I
have
said
,
Mr.
Traddles
,
''
observed
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
,
evidently
taking
a
new
interest
in
him
,
``
of
the
affection
*NL*
that
is
modest
and
retiring
;
that
waits
and
waits
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Entirely
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Clarissa
looked
at
Miss
Lavinia
,
and
shook
her
head
gravely
.
Miss
*NL*
Lavinia
looked
consciously
at
Miss
Clarissa
,
and
heaved
a
little
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Lavinia
,
''
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
``
take
my
smelling-bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
revived
herself
with
a
few
whiffs
of
aromatic
*NL*
vinegar
--
Traddles
and
I
looking
on
with
great
solicitude
the
while
;
and
*NL*
then
went
on
to
say
,
rather
faintly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
and
myself
have
been
in
great
doubt
,
Mr.
Traddles
,
what
*NL*
course
we
ought
to
take
in
reference
to
the
likings
,
or
imaginary
*NL*
likings
,
of
such
very
young
people
as
your
friend
Mr.
Copperfield
,
and
*NL*
our
niece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
brother
Francis
's
child
,
''
remarked
Miss
Clarissa
.
``
If
our
brother
*NL*
Francis
's
wife
had
found
it
convenient
in
her
life-time
-LRB-
though
she
had
*NL*
an
unquestionable
right
to
act
as
she
thought
best
-RRB-
to
invite
the
family
*NL*
to
her
dinner-table
,
we
might
have
known
our
brother
Francis
's
child
*NL*
better
at
the
present
moment
.
Sister
Lavinia
,
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
turned
my
letter
,
so
as
to
bring
the
superscription
towards
*NL*
herself
,
and
referred
through
her
eye-glass
to
some
orderly-looking
*NL*
notes
she
had
made
on
that
part
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
us
,
''
said
she
,
``
prudent
,
Mr.
Traddles
,
to
bring
these
*NL*
feelings
to
the
test
of
our
own
observation

At
present
we
know
nothing
*NL*
of
them
,
and
are
not
in
a
situation
to
judge
how
much
reality
there
may
*NL*
be
in
them
.
Therefore
we
are
inclined
so
far
to
accede
to
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
's
proposal
,
as
to
admit
his
visits
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never

''
I
exclaimed
,
relieved
of
an
immense
load
*NL*
of
apprehension
,
``
forget
your
kindness

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
pursued
Miss
Lavinia
,
--
``

would
prefer

We
must
guard

ourselves

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

with
a
sigh

*NL*
*NL*
``

Traddles

turning
to
me
,
``

nothing

be
more
reasonable

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

cried
I.
``
I
am
deeply
sensible

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

said
Miss

,
again
referring
to
her
*NL*
notes
,
``

admitting

assented
Miss

resignedly

receiving

We
must
make
this
a
most
express
and
serious
*NL*
stipulation
,
not
to
be
broken
on
any
account
.
We
wished
Mr.
Copperfield
*NL*
to
be
accompanied
by
some
confidential
friend
to-day
,
''
with
an
*NL*
inclination
of
her
head
towards
Traddles
,
who
bowed
,
``
in
order
that
*NL*
there
might
be
no
doubt
or
misconception
on
this
subject

If
Mr.

Copperfield
,
or
if
you
,
Mr.

,
feel
the
least
scruple
,
in
giving
*NL*
this
promise
,
I
beg
you
to
take
time
to
consider
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
exclaimed
,
in
a
state
of
high
ecstatic
fervor
,
that
not
a
moment
's
*NL*
consideration
could
be
necessary
.
I
bound
myself
by
the
required
*NL*
promise
,
in
a
most
impassioned
manner
;
called
upon
Traddles
to
witness
*NL*
it
;
and
denounced
myself
as
the
most
atrocious
of
characters
if
I
ever
*NL*
swerved
from
it
in
the
least
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
holding
up
her
hand
;
``
we
resolved
,
before
we
*NL*
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
you
two
gentlemen
,
to
leave
you
alone
for
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
to
consider
this
point
.
You
will
allow
us
to
*NL*
retire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
for
me
to
say
that
no
consideration
was
necessary
.
They
*NL*
persisted
in
withdrawing
for
the
specified
time
.
Accordingly
,
these
*NL*
little
birds
hopped
out
with
great
dignity
;
leaving
me
to
receive
the
*NL*
congratulations
of
Traddles
,
and
to
feel
as
if
I
were
translated
to
*NL*
regions
of
exquisite
happiness
.
Exactly
at
the
expiration
of
the
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
,
they
reappeared
with
no
less
dignity
than
they
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
They
had
gone
rustling
away
as
if
their
little
dresses
were
*NL*
made
of
autumn-leaves
:
and
they
came
rustling
back
,
in
like
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
bound
myself
once
more
to
the
prescribed
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Miss

*NL*
*NL*
Miss

unfolding
her
arms
for
the

took
the
notes

*NL*
glanced
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Miss

``

I
bowed

*NL*
I
bowed
again

``

said
Miss

*NL*
*NL*
I
intimated
that
my

would
be
proud

delighted
to
make
their

acquaintance
;
though
I
must
say
I
was
not
quite
sure
of
their
getting
on
*NL*
very
satisfactorily
together

The
conditions
being
now
closed

I
*NL*
expressed
my
acknowledgments

warmest
manner

,
taking
the
*NL*
hand

first
of
Miss

then
of
Miss

pressed
it

each

to
my

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
then
arose
,

begging
Mr.

to
excuse
us
for
a
*NL*
minute

requested
me
to
follow
her
.
I
obeyed
,
all
in
a
tremble

was
*NL*
conducted
into
another
room

There
,
I
found
my
blessed
darling
stopping
*NL*
her
ears
behind
the
door
,
with
her
dear
little
face
against
the
wall
;
*NL*
and
Jip
in
the
plate-warmer
with
his
head
tied
up
in

towel

*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
How
beautiful
she
was
in
her
black
frock

and
how
she
sobbed

*NL*
cried
at
first
,
and
would
n't
come
out
from
behind
the
door
!
How
fond
we

were
of
one
another
,
when
she
did
come
out
at
last

what
a
state
of

bliss
I
was
in
,
when
we
took
Jip
out
of
the
plate-warmer
,

restored
*NL*
him
to
the
light

sneezing
very
much

were
all
three
reunited

please
do
n't
bring
her
!
''
said
Dora
,
giving
me
a
horrified
*NL*
little
kiss
,
and
folding
her
hands
.
``
Do
n't
.
I
know
she
's
a
naughty
,
*NL*
mischief-making
old
thing
!
Do
n't
let
her
come
here
,
Doady
!
''
which
was
a
*NL*
corruption
of
David
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remonstrance
was
of
no
use
,
then
;
so
I
laughed
,
and
admired
,
and
was
*NL*
very
much
in
love
and
very
happy
;
and
she
showed
me
Jip
's
new
trick
of
*NL*
standing
on
his
hind
legs
in
a
corner
--
which
he
did
for
about
the
space
*NL*
of
a
flash
of
lightning
,
and
then
fell
down
--
and
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
*NL*
should
have
stayed
there
,
oblivious
of
Traddles
,
if
Miss
Lavinia
had
not
*NL*
come
in
to
take
me
away
.
Miss
Lavinia
was
very
fond
of
Dora
-LRB-
she
told
me
*NL*
Dora
was
exactly
like
what
she
had
been
herself
at
her
age
--
she
must
*NL*
have
altered
a
good
deal
-RRB-
,
and
she
treated
Dora
just
as
if
she
had
been
*NL*
a
toy
.
I
wanted
to
persuade
Dora
to
come
and
see
Traddles
,
but
on
my
*NL*
proposing
it
she
ran
off
to
her
own
room
and
locked
herself
in
;
so
I
*NL*
went
to
Traddles
without
her
,
and
walked
away
with
him
on
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
,
''
said
Traddles
;
``
and
they
are
very
*NL*
agreeable
old
ladies
,
I
am
sure
.
I
should
n't
be
at
all
surprised
if
you
*NL*
were
to
be
married
years
before
me
,
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
your
Sophy
play
on
any
instrument
,
Traddles
?
''
I
enquired
,
in
the
*NL*
pride
of
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
enough
of
the
piano
to
teach
it
to
her
little
sisters
,
''
said
*NL*
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
sing
at
all
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
sings
ballads
,
sometimes
,
to
freshen
up
the
others
a
little
*NL*
when
they
're
out
of
spirits
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
Nothing
scientific
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
sing
to
the
guitar
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
no
!
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paint
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
promised
Traddles
that
he
should
hear
Dora
sing
,
and
see
some
of
her
*NL*
flower-painting
.
He
said
he
should
like
it
very
much
,
and
we
went
home
*NL*
arm
in
arm
in
great
good
humour
and
delight
.
I
encouraged
him
to
talk
*NL*
about
Sophy
,
on
the
way
;
which
he
did
with
a
loving
reliance
on
her
that
*NL*
I
very
much
admired
.
I
compared
her
in
my
mind
with
Dora
,
with
*NL*
considerable
inward
satisfaction
;
but
I
candidly
admitted
to
myself
that
*NL*
she
seemed
to
be
an
excellent
kind
of
girl
for
Traddles
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
my
aunt
was
immediately
made
acquainted
with
the
successful
*NL*
issue
of
the
conference
,
and
with
all
that
had
been
said
and
done
in
the
*NL*
course
of
it
.
She
was
happy
to
see
me
so
happy
,
and
promised
to
call
on
*NL*
Dora
's
aunts
without
loss
of
time
.
But
she
took
such
a
long
walk
up
and
*NL*
down
our
rooms
that
night
,
while
I
was
writing
to
Agnes
,
that
I
began
to
*NL*
think
she
meant
to
walk
till
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
letter
to
Agnes
was
a
fervent
and
grateful
one
,
narrating
all
the
*NL*
good
effects
that
had
resulted
from
my
following
her
advice
.
She
wrote
,
*NL*
by
return
of
post
,
to
me
.
Her
letter
was
hopeful
,
earnest
,
and
cheerful
.
*NL*
She
was
always
cheerful
from
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
my
hands
more
full
than
ever
,
now
.
My
daily
journies
to
Highgate
*NL*
considered
,
Putney
was
a
long
way
off
;
and
I
naturally
wanted
to
go
*NL*
there
as
often
as
I
could
.
The
proposed
tea-drinkings
being
quite
*NL*
impracticable
,
I
compounded
with
Miss
Lavinia
for
permission
to
visit
*NL*
every
Saturday
afternoon
,
without
detriment
to
my
privileged
Sundays
.
*NL*
So
,
the
close
of
every
week
was
a
delicious
time
for
me
;
and
I
got
*NL*
through
the
rest
of
the
week
by
looking
forward
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
wonderfully
relieved
to
find
that
my
aunt
and
Dora
's
aunts
rubbed
*NL*
on
,
all
things
considered
,
much
more
smoothly
than
I
could
have
*NL*
expected
.
My
aunt
made
her
promised
visit
within
a
few
days
of
the
*NL*
conference
;
and
within
a
few
more
days
,
Dora
's
aunts
called
upon
her
,
in
*NL*
due
state
and
form
.
Similar
but
more
friendly
exchanges
took
place
*NL*
afterwards
,
usually
at
intervals
of
three
or
four
weeks
.
I
know
that
my
*NL*
aunt
distressed
Dora
's
aunts
very
much
,
by
utterly
setting
at
naught
the
*NL*
dignity
of
fly-conveyance
,
and
walking
out
to
Putney
at
extraordinary
*NL*
times
,
as
shortly
after
breakfast
or
just
before
tea
;
likewise
by
*NL*
wearing
her
bonnet
in
any
manner
that
happened
to
be
comfortable
to
her
*NL*
head
,
without
at
all
deferring
to
the
prejudices
of
civilisation
on
that
*NL*
subject
.
But
Dora
's
aunts
soon
agreed
to
regard
my
aunt
as
an
eccentric
*NL*
and
somewhat
masculine
lady
,
with
a
strong
understanding
;
and
although
*NL*
my
aunt
occasionally
ruffled
the
feathers
of
Dora
's
aunts
,
by
expressing
*NL*
heretical
opinions
on
various
points
of
ceremony
,
she
loved
me
too
well
*NL*
not
to
sacrifice
some
of
her
little
peculiarities
to
the
general
*NL*
harmony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
member
of
our
small
society
,
who
positively
refused
to
adapt
*NL*
himself
to
circumstances
,
was
Jip
.
He
never
saw
my
aunt
without
*NL*
immediately
displaying
every
tooth
in
his
head
,
retiring
under
a
chair
,
*NL*
and
growling
incessantly
:
with
now
and
then
a
doleful
howl
,
as
if
she
*NL*
really
were
too
much
for
his
feelings
.
All
kinds
of
treatment
were
tried
*NL*
with
him
,
coaxing
,
scolding
,
slapping
,
bringing
him
to
Buckingham
Street
*NL*
-LRB-
where
he
instantly
dashed
at
the
two
cats
,
to
the
terror
of
all
*NL*
beholders
-RRB-
;
but
he
never
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
bear
my
aunt
's
*NL*
society
.
He
would
sometimes
think
he
had
got
the
better
of
his
*NL*
objection
,
and
be
amiable
for
a
few
minutes
;
and
then
would
put
up
his
*NL*
snub
nose
,
and
howl
to
that
extent
,
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
*NL*
blind
him
and
put
him
in
the
plate-warmer
.
At
length
,
Dora
regularly
*NL*
muffled
him
in
a
towel
and
shut
him
up
there
,
whenever
my
aunt
was
*NL*
reported
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
troubled
me
much
,
after
we
had
fallen
into
this
quiet
train
.
*NL*
It
was
,
that
Dora
seemed
by
one
consent
to
be
regarded
like
a
pretty
toy
*NL*
or
plaything
.
My
aunt
,
with
whom
she
gradually
became
familiar
,
always
*NL*
called
her
Little
Blossom
;
and
the
pleasure
of
Miss
Lavinia
's
life
was
*NL*
to
wait
upon
her
,
curl
her
hair
,
make
ornaments
for
her
,
and
treat
her
*NL*
like
a
pet
child
.
What
Miss
Lavinia
did
,
her
sister
did
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
.
It
was
very
odd
to
me
;
but
they
all
seemed
to
treat
Dora
,
in
her
*NL*
degree
,
much
as
Dora
treated
Jip
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
Dora
about
this
;
and
one
day
when
we
were
*NL*
out
walking
-LRB-
for
we
were
licensed
by
Miss
Lavinia
,
after
a
while
,
to
go
*NL*
out
walking
by
ourselves
-RRB-
,
I
said
to
her
that
I
wished
she
could
get
*NL*
them
to
behave
towards
her
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
know
,
my
darling
,
''
I
remonstrated
,
``
you
are
not
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Dora
.
``
Now
you
're
going
to
be
cross
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
,
my
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
they
're
very
kind
to
me
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
and
I
am
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
But
my
dearest
life
!
''
said
I
,
``
you
might
be
very
happy
,
and
yet
*NL*
be
treated
rationally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
gave
me
a
reproachful
look
--
the
prettiest
look
!
--
and
then
began
to
*NL*
sob
,
saying
if
I
did
n't
like
her
,
why
had
I
ever
wanted
so
much
to
be
*NL*
engaged
to
her
?
And
why
did
n't
I
go
away
,
now
,
if
I
could
n't
bear
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
do
,
but
kiss
away
her
tears
,
and
tell
her
how
I
doted
on
*NL*
her
,
after
that
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
am
very
affectionate
,
''
said
Dora
;
``
you
ought
n't
to
be
cruel
*NL*
to
me
,
Doady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
,
my
precious
love
!
As
if
I
would
--
or
could
--
be
cruel
to
you
,
for
*NL*
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
find
fault
with
me
,
''
said
Dora
,
making
a
rosebud
of
her
*NL*
mouth
;
``
and
I
'll
be
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
charmed
by
her
presently
asking
me
,
of
her
own
accord
,
to
give
her
*NL*
that
cookery-book
I
had
once
spoken
of
,
and
to
show
her
how
to
keep
*NL*
accounts
as
I
had
once
promised
I
would
.
I
brought
the
volume
with
me
on
*NL*
my
next
visit
-LRB-
I
got
it
prettily
bound
,
first
,
to
make
it
look
less
dry
*NL*
and
more
inviting
-RRB-
;
and
as
we
strolled
about
the
Common
,
I
showed
her
an
*NL*
old
housekeeping-book
of
my
aunt
's
,
and
gave
her
a
set
of
tablets
,
and
a
*NL*
pretty
little
pencil
case
and
box
of
leads
,
to
practise
housekeeping
*NL*
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
cookery-book
made
Dora
's
head
ache
,
and
the
figures
made
her
*NL*
cry
.
They
would
n't
add
up
,
she
said
.
So
she
rubbed
them
out
,
and
drew
*NL*
little
nosegays
,
and
likenesses
of
me
and
Jip
,
all
over
the
tablets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
playfully
tried
verbal
instruction
in
domestic
matters
,
as
we
*NL*
walked
about
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
.
Sometimes
,
for
example
,
when
we
*NL*
passed
a
butcher
's
shop
,
I
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
suppose
,
my
pet
,
that
we
were
married
,
and
you
were
going
to
buy
a
*NL*
shoulder
of
mutton
for
dinner
,
would
you
know
how
to
buy
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
pretty
little
Dora
's
face
would
fall
,
and
she
would
make
her
mouth
*NL*
into
a
bud
again
,
as
if
she
would
very
much
prefer
to
shut
mine
with
a
*NL*
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
know
how
to
buy
it
,
my
darling
?
''
I
would
repeat
,
perhaps
,
if
*NL*
I
were
very
inflexible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
would
think
a
little
,
and
then
reply
,
perhaps
,
with
great
triumph
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
butcher
would
know
how
to
sell
it
,
and
what
need
_
I
_
know
?
Oh
,
*NL*
you
silly
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
when
I
once
asked
Dora
,
with
an
eye
to
the
cookery-book
,
what
she
*NL*
would
do
,
if
we
were
married
,
and
I
were
to
say
I
should
like
a
nice
*NL*
Irish
stew
,
she
replied
that
she
would
tell
the
servant
to
make
it
;
and
*NL*
then
clapped
her
little
hands
together
across
my
arm
,
and
laughed
in
*NL*
such
a
charming
manner
that
she
was
more
delightful
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consequently
,
the
principal
use
to
which
the
cookery-book
was
devoted
,
*NL*
was
being
put
down
in
the
corner
for
Jip
to
stand
upon
.
But
Dora
was
so
*NL*
pleased
,
when
she
had
trained
him
to
stand
upon
it
without
offering
to
*NL*
come
off
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
hold
the
pencil
case
in
his
mouth
,
*NL*
that
I
was
very
glad
I
had
bought
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
fell
back
on
the
guitar-case
,
and
the
flower-painting
,
and
the
*NL*
songs
about
never
leaving
off
dancing
,
Ta
ra
la
!
and
were
as
happy
as
*NL*
the
week
was
long
.
I
occasionally
wished
I
could
venture
to
hint
to
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
,
that
she
treated
the
darling
of
my
heart
a
little
too
*NL*
much
like
a
plaything
;
and
I
sometimes
awoke
,
as
it
were
,
wondering
to
*NL*
find
that
I
had
fallen
into
the
general
fault
,
and
treated
her
like
a
*NL*
plaything
too
--
but
not
often
.

CHAPTER
XLII
.
*NL*
*NL*
MISCHIEF
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
as
if
it
were
not
for
me
to
record
,
even
though
this
manuscript
*NL*
is
intended
for
no
eyes
but
mine
,
how
hard
I
worked
at
that
tremendous
*NL*
short-hand
,
and
all
improvement
appertaining
to
it
,
in
my
sense
of
*NL*
responsibility
to
Dora
and
her
aunts
.
I
will
only
add
,
to
what
I
have
*NL*
already
written
of
my
perseverance
at
this
time
of
my
life
,
and
of
a
*NL*
patient
and
continuous
energy
which
then
began
to
be
matured
within
me
,
*NL*
and
which
I
know
to
be
the
strong
part
of
my
character
,
if
it
have
any
*NL*
strength
at
all
,
that
there
,
on
looking
back
,
I
find
the
source
of
my
*NL*
success
.
I
have
been
very
fortunate
in
worldly
matters
;
many
men
have
*NL*
worked
much
harder
,
and
not
succeeded
half
so
well
;
but
I
never
could
*NL*
have
done
what
I
have
done
,
without
the
habits
of
punctuality
,
order
,
*NL*
and
diligence
,
without
the
determination
to
concentrate
myself
on
one
*NL*
object
at
a
time
,
no
matter
how
quickly
its
successor
should
come
upon
*NL*
its
heels
,
which
I
then
formed
.
Heaven
knows
I
write
this
,
in
no
spirit
*NL*
of
self-laudation
.
The
man
who
reviews
his
own
life
,
as
I
do
mine
,
in
*NL*
going
on
here
,
from
page
to
page
,
had
need
to
have
been
a
good
man
*NL*
indeed
,
if
he
would
be
spared
the
sharp
consciousness
of
many
talents
*NL*
neglected
,
many
opportunities
wasted
,
many
erratic
and
perverted
*NL*
feelings
constantly
at
war
within
his
breast
,
and
defeating
him
.
I
do
*NL*
not
hold
one
natural
gift
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
have
not
abused
.
My
*NL*
meaning
simply
is
,
that
whatever
I
have
tried
to
do
in
life
,
I
have
*NL*
tried
with
all
my
heart
to
do
well
;
that
whatever
I
have
devoted
myself
*NL*
to
,
I
have
devoted
myself
to
completely
;
that
,
in
great
aims
and
in
*NL*
small
,
I
have
always
been
thoroughly
in
earnest
.
I
have
never
believed
*NL*
it
possible
that
any
natural
or
improved
ability
can
claim
immunity
from
*NL*
the
companionship
of
the
steady
,
plain
,
hard-working
qualities
,
and
hope
*NL*
to
gain
its
end
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
such
fulfilment
on
this
*NL*
earth
.
Some
happy
talent
,
and
some
fortunate
opportunity
,
may
form
the
*NL*
two
sides
of
the
ladder
on
which
some
men
mount
,
but
the
rounds
of
that
*NL*
ladder
must
be
made
of
stuff
to
stand
wear
and
tear
;
and
there
is
no
*NL*
substitute
for
thorough-going
,
ardent
,
and
sincere
earnestness
.
Never
to
*NL*
put
one
hand
to
anything
,
on
which
I
could
throw
my
whole
self
;
and
*NL*
never
to
affect
depreciation
of
my
work
,
whatever
it
was
;
I
find
,
now
,
*NL*
to
have
been
my
golden
rules
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
much
of
the
practice
I
have
just
reduced
to
precept
,
I
owe
to
Agnes
,
*NL*
I
will
not
repeat
here
.
My
narrative
proceeds
to
Agnes
,
with
a
thankful
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
on
a
visit
of
a
fortnight
to
the
Doctor
's
.
Mr.
Wickfield
was
*NL*
the
Doctor
's
old
friend
,
and
the
Doctor
wished
to
talk
with
him
,
and
do
*NL*
him
good
.
It
had
been
matter
of
conversation
with
Agnes
when
she
was
*NL*
last
in
town
,
and
this
visit
was
the
result
.
She
and
her
father
came
*NL*
together
.
I
was
not
much
surprised
to
hear
from
her
that
she
had
engaged
*NL*
to
find
a
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
for
Mrs.
Heep
,
whose
rheumatic
*NL*
complaint
required
change
of
air
,
and
who
would
be
charmed
to
have
it
in
*NL*
such
company
.
Neither
was
I
surprised
when
,
on
the
very
next
day
,
Uriah
,
*NL*
like
a
dutiful
son
,
brought
his
worthy
mother
to
take
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
he
,
as
he
forced
himself
upon
my
*NL*
company
for
a
turn
in
the
Doctor
's
garden
,
``
where
a
person
loves
,
a
*NL*
person
is
a
little
jealous
--
leastways
,
anxious
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
*NL*
beloved
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
are
you
jealous
,
now
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
returned
,
``
of
no
one
in
*NL*
particular
just
at
present
--
no
male
person
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
you
are
jealous
of
a
female
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
a
sidelong
glance
out
of
his
sinister
red
eyes
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
said
,
''
--
I
should
say
Mister
,
but
I
*NL*
know
you
'll
excuse
the
abit
I
've
got
into
--
you
're
so
insinuating
,
that
*NL*
you
draw
me
like
a
corkscrew
!
Well
,
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
''
putting
*NL*
his
fish-like
hand
on
mine
,
``
I
'm
not
a
lady
's
man
in
general
,
sir
,
and
I
*NL*
never
was
,
with
Mrs.
Strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
looked
green
now
,
as
they
watched
mine
with
a
rascally
cunning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
though
I
am
a
lawyer
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
replied
,
with
a
dry
*NL*
grin
,
``
I
mean
,
just
at
present
,
what
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
mean
by
your
look
?
''
I
retorted
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
look
?
Dear
me
,
Copperfield
,
that
's
sharp
practice
!
What
do
I
mean
*NL*
by
my
look
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I.
``
By
your
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
very
much
amused
,
and
laughed
as
heartily
as
it
was
in
his
*NL*
nature
to
laugh
.
After
some
scraping
of
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
he
went
*NL*
on
to
say
,
with
his
eyes
cast
downward
--
still
scraping
,
very
slowly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
but
a
numble
clerk
,
she
always
looked
down
upon
me
.
She
was
*NL*
for
ever
having
my
Agnes
backwards
and
forwards
at
her
ouse
,
and
she
was
*NL*
for
ever
being
a
friend
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
;
but
I
was
too
far
*NL*
beneath
her
,
myself
,
to
be
noticed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
I
;
``
suppose
you
were
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
And
beneath
him
,
too
,
''
pursued
Uriah
,
very
distinctly
,
and
in
a
*NL*
meditative
tone
of
voice
,
as
he
continued
to
scrape
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
the
Doctor
better
,
''
said
I
,
``
than
to
suppose
him
*NL*
conscious
of
your
existence
,
when
you
were
not
before
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
directed
his
eyes
at
me
in
that
sidelong
glance
again
,
and
he
made
*NL*
his
face
very
lantern-jawed
,
for
the
greater
convenience
of
scraping
,
as
*NL*
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
I
am
not
referring
to
the
Doctor
!
Oh
no
,
poor
man
!
I
mean
Mr.
*NL*
Maldon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
quite
died
within
me
.
All
my
old
doubts
and
apprehensions
on
*NL*
that
subject
,
all
the
Doctor
's
happiness
and
peace
,
all
the
mingled
*NL*
possibilities
of
innocence
and
compromise
,
that
I
could
not
unravel
,
I
*NL*
saw
,
in
a
moment
,
at
the
mercy
of
this
fellow
's
twisting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
could
come
into
the
office
,
without
ordering
and
shoving
me
*NL*
about
,
''
said
Uriah
.
``
One
of
your
fine
gentlemen
he
was
!
I
was
very
meek
*NL*
and
umble
--
and
I
am
.
But
I
did
n't
like
that
sort
of
thing
--
and
I
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
off
scraping
his
chin
,
and
sucked
in
his
cheeks
until
they
*NL*
seemed
to
meet
inside
;
keeping
his
sidelong
glance
upon
me
all
the
*NL*
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
one
of
your
lovely
women
,
she
is
,
''
he
pursued
,
when
he
had
*NL*
slowly
restored
his
face
to
its
natural
form
;
``
and
ready
to
be
no
friend
*NL*
to
such
as
me
,
_
I
_
know
.
She
's
just
the
person
as
would
put
my
Agnes
up
*NL*
to
higher
sort
of
game
.
Now
,
I
ai
n't
one
of
your
lady
's
men
,
Master
*NL*
Copperfield
;
but
I
've
had
eyes
in
my
ed
,
a
pretty
long
time
back
.
We
*NL*
umble
ones
have
got
eyes
,
mostly
speaking
--
and
we
look
out
of
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
endeavoured
to
appear
unconscious
and
not
disquieted
,
but
,
I
saw
in
*NL*
his
face
,
with
poor
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'm
not
a
going
to
let
myself
be
run
down
,
Copperfield
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
raising
that
part
of
his
countenance
where
his
red
eyebrows
*NL*
would
have
been
if
he
had
had
any
,
with
malignant
triumph
,
``
and
I
shall
*NL*
do
what
I
can
to
put
a
stop
to
this
friendship
.
I
do
n't
approve
of
it
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
mind
acknowledging
to
you
that
I
've
got
rather
a
grudging
*NL*
disposition
,
and
want
to
keep
off
all
intruders
.
I
ai
n't
a
going
,
if
I
*NL*
know
it
,
to
run
the
risk
of
being
plotted
against
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
plotting
,
and
delude
yourself
into
the
belief
that
*NL*
everybody
else
is
doing
the
like
,
I
think
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
he
replied
.
``
But
I
've
got
a
motive
,
as
*NL*
my
fellow-partner
used
to
say
;
and
I
go
at
it
tooth
and
nail
.
I
must
n't
*NL*
be
put
upon
,
as
a
numble
person
,
too
much
.
I
ca
n't
allow
people
in
my
*NL*
way
.
Really
they
must
come
out
of
the
cart
,
Master
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
,
though
?
''
he
returned
,
with
one
of
his
jerks
.
``
I
'm
astonished
*NL*
at
that
,
Master
Copperfield
,
you
being
usually
so
quick
!
I
'll
try
to
be
*NL*
plainer
,
another
time
.
--
Is
that
Mr.
Maldon
a-norseback
,
ringing
at
the
*NL*
gate
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
him
,
''
I
replied
,
as
carelessly
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uriah
stopped
short
,
put
his
hands
between
his
great
knobs
of
knees
,
and
*NL*
doubled
himself
up
with
laughter
.
With
perfectly
silent
laughter
.
Not
a
*NL*
sound
escaped
from
him
.
I
was
so
repelled
by
his
odious
behaviour
,
*NL*
particularly
by
this
concluding
instance
,
that
I
turned
away
without
any
*NL*
ceremony
;
and
left
him
doubled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
,
like
a
*NL*
scarecrow
in
want
of
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
on
that
evening
;
but
,
as
I
well
remember
,
on
the
next
evening
*NL*
but
one
,
which
was
a
Saturday
;
that
I
took
Agnes
to
see
Dora
.
I
had
*NL*
arranged
the
visit
,
beforehand
,
with
Miss
Lavinia
;
and
Agnes
was
*NL*
expected
to
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
a
flutter
of
pride
and
anxiety
;
pride
in
my
dear
little
*NL*
betrothed
,
and
anxiety
that
Agnes
should
like
her
.
All
the
way
to
*NL*
Putney
,
Agnes
being
inside
the
stage-coach
,
and
I
outside
,
I
pictured
*NL*
Dora
to
myself
in
every
one
of
the
pretty
looks
I
knew
so
well
;
now
*NL*
making
up
my
mind
that
I
should
like
her
to
look
exactly
as
she
looked
*NL*
at
such
a
time
,
and
then
doubting
whether
I
should
not
prefer
her
*NL*
looking
as
she
looked
at
such
another
time
;
and
almost
worrying
myself
*NL*
into
a
fever
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
troubled
by
no
doubt
of
her
being
very
pretty
,
in
any
case
;
but
it
*NL*
fell
out
that
I
had
never
seen
her
look
so
well
.
She
was
not
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
when
I
presented
Agnes
to
her
little
aunts
,
but
was
shyly
*NL*
keeping
out
of
the
way
.
I
knew
where
to
look
for
her
,
now
;
and
sure
*NL*
enough
I
found
her
stopping
her
ears
again
,
behind
the
same
dull
old
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
she
would
n't
come
at
all
;
and
then
she
pleaded
for
five
minutes
*NL*
by
my
watch
.
When
at
length
she
put
her
arm
through
mine
,
to
be
taken
to
*NL*
the
drawing-room
,
her
charming
little
face
was
flushed
,
and
had
never
*NL*
been
so
pretty
.
But
,
when
we
went
into
the
room
,
and
it
turned
pale
,
she
*NL*
was
ten
thousand
times
prettier
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
was
afraid
of
Agnes
.
She
had
told
me
that
she
knew
Agnes
was
``
too
*NL*
clever
.
''
But
when
she
saw
her
looking
at
once
so
cheerful
and
so
*NL*
earnest
,
and
so
thoughtful
,
and
so
good
,
she
gave
a
faint
little
cry
of
*NL*
pleased
surprise
,
and
just
put
her
affectionate
arms
round
Agnes
's
neck
,
*NL*
and
laid
her
innocent
cheek
against
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
was
so
happy
.
I
never
was
so
pleased
as
when
I
saw
those
two
sit
*NL*
down
together
,
side
by
side
.
As
when
I
saw
my
little
darling
looking
up
*NL*
so
naturally
to
those
cordial
eyes
.
As
when
I
saw
the
tender
,
beautiful
*NL*
regard
which
Agnes
cast
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
partook
,
in
their
way
,
of
my
joy
.
It
was
*NL*
the
pleasantest
tea-table
in
the
world
.
Miss
Clarissa
presided
.
I
cut
*NL*
and
handed
the
sweet
seed-cake
--
the
little
sisters
had
a
bird-like
*NL*
fondness
for
picking
up
seeds
and
pecking
at
sugar
;
Miss
Lavinia
looked
*NL*
on
with
benignant
patronage
,
as
if
our
happy
love
were
all
her
work
;
and
*NL*
we
were
perfectly
contented
with
ourselves
and
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentle
cheerfulness
of
Agnes
went
to
all
their
hearts
.
Her
quiet
*NL*
interest
in
everything
that
interested
Dora
;
her
manner
of
making
*NL*
acquaintance
with
Jip
-LRB-
who
responded
instantly
-RRB-
;
her
pleasant
way
,
when
*NL*
Dora
was
ashamed
to
come
over
to
her
usual
seat
by
me
;
her
modest
grace
*NL*
and
ease
,
eliciting
a
crowd
of
blushing
little
marks
of
confidence
from
*NL*
Dora
;
seemed
to
make
our
circle
quite
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
,
''
said
Dora
,
after
tea
,
``
that
you
like
me
.
I
did
n't
think
*NL*
you
would
;
and
I
want
,
more
than
ever
,
to
be
liked

now
Julia
Mills
is
*NL*
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
omitted
to
mention
it
,
by-the-bye
.
Miss
Mills
had
sailed
,
and
*NL*
Dora
and
I
had
gone
aboard
a
great
East
Indiaman
at
Gravesend
to
see
*NL*
her
;
and
we
had
had
preserved
ginger
,
and
guava
,
and
other
delicacies
of
*NL*
that
sort
for
lunch
;
and
we
had
left
Miss
Mills
weeping
on
a
camp-stool
*NL*
on
the
quarter-deck
,
with
a
large
new
diary
under
her
arm
,
in
which
the
*NL*
original
reflections
awakened
by
the
contemplation
of
Ocean
were
to
be
*NL*
recorded
under
lock
and
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
said
,
she
was
afraid
I
must
have
given
her
an
unpromising
*NL*
character
;
but
Dora
corrected
that
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
she
said
,
shaking
her
curls
at
me
;
``
it
was
all
praise
.
He
*NL*
thinks
so
much
of
your
opinion
,
that
I
was
quite
afraid
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
opinion
can
not
strengthen
his
attachment
to
some
people
whom
he
*NL*
knows
,
''
said
Agnes
,
with
a
smile
;
``
it
is
not
worth
their
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
please
let
me
have
it
,
''
said
Dora
,
in
her
coaxing
way
,
``
if
you
*NL*
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
merry
about
Dora
's
wanting
to
be
liked
,
and
Dora
said
I
was
a
*NL*
goose
,
and
she
did
n't
like
me
at
any
rate
,
and
the
short
evening
flew
*NL*
away
on
gossamer-wings
.
The
time
was
at
hand
when
the
coach
was
to
call
*NL*
for
us
.
I
was
standing
alone
before
the
fire
,
when
Dora
came
stealing
*NL*
softly
in
,
to
give
me
that
usual
precious
little
kiss
before
I
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
,
if
I
had
had
her
for
a
friend
a
long
time
ago
,
Doady
,
''
*NL*
said
Dora
,
her
bright
eyes
shining
very
brightly
,
and
her
little
right
*NL*
hand
idly
busying
itself
with
one
of
the
buttons
of
my
coat
,
``
I
might
*NL*
have
been
more
clever
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
!
''
said
I
,
``
what
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
is
nonsense
?
''
returned
Dora
,
without
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
forgotten
,
''
said
Dora
,
still
turning
the
button
round
and
round
,
*NL*
``
what
relation
Agnes
is
to
you
,
you
dear
bad
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
blood-relation
,
''
I
replied
;
``
but
we
were
brought
up
together
,
like
*NL*
brother
and
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
you
ever
fell
in
love
with
me
?
''
said
Dora
,
beginning
on
*NL*
another
button
of
my
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
because
I
could
n't
see
you
,
and
not
love
you
,
Dora
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
you
had
never
seen
me
at
all
,
''
said
Dora
,
going
to
another
*NL*
button
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
we
had
never
been
born
!
''
said
I
,
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
about
,
as
I
glanced
in
admiring
silence
*NL*
at
the
little
soft
hand
travelling
up
the
row
of
buttons
on
my
coat
,
and
*NL*
at
the
clustering
hair
that
lay
against
my
breast
,
and
at
the
lashes
of
*NL*
her
downcast
eyes
,
slightly
rising
as
they
followed
her
idle
fingers
.
At
*NL*
length
her
eyes
were
lifted
up
to
mine
,
and
she
stood
on
tiptoe
to
give
*NL*
me
,
more
thoughtfully
than
usual
,
that
precious
little
kiss
--
once
,
*NL*
twice
,
three
times
--
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
came
back
together
within
five
minutes
afterwards
,
and
Dora
's
*NL*
unusual
thoughtfulness
was
quite
gone
then
.
She
was
laughingly
resolved
*NL*
to
put
Jip
through
the
whole
of
his
performances
,
before
the
coach
came
.
*NL*
They
took
some
time
-LRB-
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
variety
,
as
Jip
's
*NL*
reluctance
-RRB-
,
and
were
still
unfinished
when
it
was
heard
at
the
door
.
*NL*
There
was
a
hurried
but
affectionate
parting
between
Agnes
and
herself
;
*NL*
and
Dora
was
to
write
to
Agnes
-LRB-
who
was
not
to
mind
her
letters
being
*NL*
foolish
,
she
said
-RRB-
,
and
Agnes
was
to
write
to
Dora
;
and
they
had
a
*NL*
second
parting
at
the
coach-door
,
and
a
third
when
Dora
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
remonstrances
of
Miss
Lavinia
,
would
come
running
out
once
more
to
*NL*
remind
Agnes
at
the
coach-window
about
writing
,
and
to
shake
her
curls
*NL*
at
me
on
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stage-coach
was
to
put
us
down
near
Covent
Garden
,
where
we
were
to
*NL*
take
another
stage-coach
for
Highgate
.
I
was
impatient
for
the
short
*NL*
walk
in
the
interval
,
that
Agnes
might
praise
Dora
to
me
.
Ah
!
what
*NL*
praise
it
was
!
How
lovingly
and
fervently
did
it
commend
the
pretty
*NL*
creature
I
had
won
,
with
all
her
artless
graces
best
displayed
,
to
my
*NL*
most
gentle
care
!
How
thoughtfully
remind
me
,
yet
with
no
pretence
of
*NL*
doing
so
,
of
the
trust
in
which
I
held
the
orphan
child
!
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
never
,
had
I
loved
Dora
so
deeply
and
truly
,
as
I
loved
her
that
*NL*
night
.
When
we
had
again
alighted
,
and
were
walking
in
the
starlight
*NL*
along
the
quiet
road
that
led
to
the
Doctor
's
house
,
I
told
Agnes
it
was
*NL*
her
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
were
sitting
by
her
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
seemed
to
be
no
less
_
her
_
*NL*
guardian
angel
than
mine
;
and
you
seem
so
now
,
Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
poor
angel
,
''
she
returned
,
``
but
faithful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clear
tone
of
her
voice
,
going
straight
to
my
heart
,
made
it
natural
*NL*
to
me
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cheerfulness
that
belongs
to
you
,
Agnes
-LRB-
and
to
no
one
else
that
*NL*
ever
I
have
seen
-RRB-
,
is
so
restored
,
I
have
observed
to-day
,
that
I
have
*NL*
begun
to
hope
you
are
happier
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happier
in
myself
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
am
quite
cheerful
and
*NL*
light-hearted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
at
the
serene
face
looking
upward
,
and
thought
it
was
the
*NL*
stars
that
made
it
seem
so
noble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
no
change
at
home
,
''
said
Agnes
,
after
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
fresh
reference
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
--
I
would
n't
distress
you
,
Agnes
,
but
I
*NL*
can
not
help
asking
--
to
what
we
spoke
of
,
when
we
parted
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
none
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
so
much
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
think
less
about
it
.
Remember
that
I
confide
in
simple
love
*NL*
and
truth
at
last
.
Have
no
apprehensions
for
me
,
Trotwood
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
after
a
moment
;
``
the
step
you
dread
my
taking
,
I
shall
never
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
think
I
had
never
really
feared
it
,
in
any
season
of
cool
*NL*
reflection
,
it
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
me
to
have
this
assurance
*NL*
from
her
own
truthful
lips
.
I
told
her
so
,
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
this
visit
is
over
,
''
said
I
,
--
``
for
we
may
not
be
alone
another
*NL*
time
,
--
how
long
is
it
likely
to
be
,
my
dear
Agnes
,
before
you
come
to
*NL*
London
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
a
long
time
,
''
she
replied
;
``
I
think
it
will
be
best
--
for
*NL*
papa
's
sake
--
to
remain
at
home
.
We
are
not
likely
to
meet
often
,
for
*NL*
some
time
to
come
;
but
I
shall
be
a
good
correspondent
of
Dora
's
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
frequently
hear
of
one
another
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
now
within
the
little
court-yard
of
the
Doctor
's
cottage
.
It
was
*NL*
growing
late
.
There
was
a
light
in
the
window
of
Mrs.
Strong
's
chamber
,
*NL*
and
Agnes
,
pointing
to
it
,
bade
me
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
troubled
,
''
she
said
,
giving
me
her
hand
,
``
by
our
misfortunes
*NL*
and
anxieties
.
I
can
be
happier
in
nothing
than
in
your
happiness
.
If
*NL*
you
can
ever
give
me
help
,
rely
upon
it
I
will
ask
you
for
it
.
God
bless
*NL*
you
always
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
beaming
smile
,
and
in
these
last
tones
of
her
cheerful
voice
,
*NL*
I
seemed
again
to
see
and
hear
my
little
Dora
in
her
company
.
I
stood
*NL*
awhile
,
looking
through
the
porch
at
the
stars
,
with
a
heart
full
of
*NL*
love
and
gratitude
,
and
then
walked
slowly
forth
.
I
had
engaged
a
bed
*NL*
at
a
decent
alehouse
close
by
,
and
was
going
out
at
the
gate
,
when
,
*NL*
happening
to
turn
my
head
,
I
saw
a
light
in
the
Doctor
's
study
.
A
*NL*
half-reproachful
fancy
came
into
my
mind
,
that
he
had
been
working
at
*NL*
the
Dictionary
without
my
help
.
With
the
view
of
seeing
if
this
were
*NL*
so
,
and
,
in
any
case
,
of
bidding
him
good
night
,
if
he
were
yet
sitting
*NL*
among
his
books
,
I
turned
back
,
and
going
softly
across
the
hall
,
and
*NL*
gently
opening
the
door
,
looked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
person
whom
I
saw
,
to
my
surprise
,
by
the
sober
light
of
the
*NL*
shaded
lamp
,
was
Uriah
.
He
was
standing
close
beside
it
,
with
one
of
his
*NL*
skeleton
hands
over
his
mouth
,
and
the
other
resting
on
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
table
.
The
Doctor
sat
in
his
study
chair
,
covering
his
face
with
his
*NL*
hands
.
Mr.
Wickfield
,
sorely
troubled
and
distressed
,
was
leaning
*NL*
forward
,
irresolutely
touching
the
Doctor
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
,
I
supposed
that
the
Doctor
was
ill
.
I
hastily
advanced
a
*NL*
step
under
that
impression
,
when
I
met
Uriah
's
eye
,
and
saw
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
.
I
would
have
withdrawn
,
but
the
Doctor
made
a
gesture
to
detain
*NL*
me
,
and
I
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
observed
Uriah
,
with
a
writhe
of
his
ungainly
person
,
``
we
*NL*
may
keep
the
door
shut
.
We
need
n't
make
it
known
to
ALL
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
which
,
he
went
on
his
toes
to
the
door
,
which
I
had
left
open
,
*NL*
and
carefully
closed
it
.
He
then
came
back
,
and
took
up
his
former
*NL*
position
.
There
was
an
obtrusive
show
of
compassionate
zeal
in
his
voice
*NL*
and
manner
,
more
intolerable
--
at
least
to
me
--
than
any
demeanour
he
*NL*
could
have
assumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
felt
it
incumbent
upon
me
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
said
Uriah
,
``
to
*NL*
point
out
to
Doctor
Strong
what
you
and
me
have
already
talked
about
.
*NL*
You
did
n't
exactly
understand
me
,
though
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
a
look
,
but
no
other
answer
;
and
,
going
to
my
good
old
*NL*
master
,
said
a
few
words
that
I
meant
to
be
words
of
comfort
and
*NL*
encouragement
.
He
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
as
it
had
been
his
*NL*
custom
to
do
when
I
was
quite
a
little
fellow
,
but
did
not
lift
his
grey
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
did
n't
understand
me
,
Master
Copperfield
,
''
resumed
Uriah
in
the
*NL*
same
officious
manner
,
``
I
may
take
the
liberty
of
umbly
mentioning
,
*NL*
being
among
friends
,
that
I
have
called
Doctor
Strong
's
attention
to
the
*NL*
goings-on
of
Mrs.
Strong
.
It
's
much
against
the
grain
with
me
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
Copperfield
,
to
be
concerned
in
anything
so
unpleasant
;
but
really
,
*NL*
as
it
is
,
we
're
all
mixing
ourselves
up
with
what
ought
n't
to
be
.
That
*NL*
was
what
my
meaning
was
,
sir
,
when
you
did
n't
understand
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wonder
now
,
when
I
recall
his
leer
,
that
I
did
not
collar
him
,
and
try
*NL*
to
shake
the
breath
out
of
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
I
did
n't
make
myself
very
clear
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
nor
you
*NL*
neither
.
Naturally
,
we
was
both
of
us
inclined
to
give
such
a
subject
a
*NL*
wide
berth
.
Hows
`
ever
,
at
last
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
plain
;
*NL*
and
I
have
mentioned
to
Doctor
Strong
that
--
did
you
speak
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
to
the
Doctor
,
who
had
moaned
.
The
sound
might
have
touched
any
*NL*
heart
,
I
thought
,
but
it
had
no
effect
upon
Uriah
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
mentioned
to
Doctor
Strong
,
''
he
proceeded
,
``
that
any
one
may
see
that
*NL*
Mr.
Maldon
,
and
the
lovely
and
agreeable
lady
as
is
Doctor
Strong
's
*NL*
wife
,
are
too
sweet
on
one
another
.
Really
the
time
is
come
-LRB-
we
being
at
*NL*
present
all
mixing
ourselves
up
with
what
ought
n't
to
be

,
when
Doctor
*NL*
Strong
must
be
told
that
this
was
full
as
plain
to
everybody
as
the
sun
,
*NL*
before
Mr.
Maldon
went
to
India

that
Mr.

made
excuses

I
was
just
putting
it
to
my

*NL*
towards

he
turned
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

Mr.

again
laying
his
*NL*
irresolute
hand
upon
the
Doctor

arm

*NL*
``

cried
Uriah

shaking
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Mr.

tremulous
voice
,
``
my

to
try
all

by
one
narrow
test

fallen
into
such

I
have
had

*NL*
*NL*

the

*NL*
*NL*

said
Mr.

I

it

remember
the
narrow
construction

which
has
been
my
besetting
sin

that

there
was
so
much

fawning

been
influenced

made
no

innumerable
feelings

circumstances

have
all
tended

good

puts
it

shaking
his

*NL*
``
Always
observing

said
Mr.
Wickfield
;
``

*NL*
by
all
that
is
dear

I
entreat
you

consider

what

am
forced

confess
now

having
no

*NL*
``
No

*NL*
``

to
this

that
I
did

said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
glancing
helplessly
and
distractedly
*NL*
at
his
partner
,
``
that
I
did
doubt
her
,
and
think
her
wanting
in
her
duty

to
you
;
and
that
I
did
sometimes
,
if
I
must
say
all
,
feel
averse
to
*NL*
Agnes
being
in
such
a
familiar
relation
towards
her
,
as
to
see
what
I
*NL*
saw
,
or
in
my
diseased
theory
fancied
that
I
saw

I
never
mentioned
this
*NL*
to
any
one

I
never
meant
it
to
be
known
to
any
one

And
though
it
is
*NL*
terrible
to
you
to
hear
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
quite
subdued
,
``
if
you
*NL*
knew
how
terrible
it
is
to
me

tell

you
would
feel
compassion

*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
,
in
the
perfect
goodness
of
his
nature
,
put
out
his
hand
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
held
it
for
a
little
while
in
his
,
with
his
head
bowed
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Uriah
,
writhing
himself
into
the
silence
like
a
*NL*
Conger-eel
,
``
that
this
is
a
subject
full
of
unpleasantness
to
everybody
.
*NL*
But
since
we
have
got
so
far
,
I
ought
to
take
the
liberty
of
mentioning
*NL*
that
Copperfield
has
noticed
it
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
upon
him
,
and
asked
him
how
he
dared
refer
to
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
it
's
very
kind
of
you
,
Copperfield

returned
Uriah
,
undulating
all
*NL*
over
,
``
and
we
all
know
what
an
amiable
character
yours
is
;
but
you
know
*NL*
that
the
moment
I
spoke
to
you
the
other
night
,
you
knew
what
I
meant
.
*NL*
You
know
you
knew
what
I
meant
,
Copperfield
.
Do
n't
deny
it
!
You
deny
it
*NL*
with
the
best
intentions
;
but
do
n't
do
it
,
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
the
mild
eye
of
the
good
old
Doctor
turned
upon
me
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
I
felt
that
the
confession
of
my
old
misgivings
and
remembrances
was
*NL*
too
plainly
written
in
my
face
to
be
overlooked
.
It
was
of
no
use
*NL*
raging
.
I
could
not
undo
that
.
Say
what
I
would
,
I
could
not
unsay
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
silent
again
,
and
remained
so
,
until
the
Doctor
rose
and
walked
*NL*
twice
or
thrice
across
the
room
.
Presently
he
returned
to
where
his
*NL*
chair
stood
;
and
,
leaning
on
the
back
of
it
,
and
occasionally
putting
*NL*
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
,
with
a
simple
honesty
that
did
him
more
*NL*
honor
,
to
my
thinking
,
than
any
disguise
he
could
have
affected
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
much
to
blame
.
I
believe
I
have
been
very
much
to
blame
.
I
*NL*
have
exposed
one
whom
I
hold
in
my
heart
,
to
trials
and
aspersions
--
I
*NL*
call
them
aspersions
,
even
to
have
been
conceived
in
anybody
's
inmost
*NL*
mind
--
of
which
she
never
,
but
for
me
,
could
have
been
the
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uriah
Heep
gave
a
kind
of
snivel
.
I
think
to
express
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
which
my
Annie
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
``
never
,
but
for
me

Gentlemen
,
I
am
old
now

as
you
know
;
I
do
not
feel
,
*NL*
to-night
,
that
I
have
much
to
live
for
.
But
my
life
--
my
Life
--
upon
the
*NL*
truth
and
honor
of
the
dear
lady
who
has
been
the
subject
of
this
*NL*
conversation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
think
that
the
best
embodiment
of
chivalry
,
the
realisation
of
*NL*
the
handsomest
and
most
romantic
figure
ever
imagined
by
painter
,
could
*NL*
have
said
this
,
with
a
more
impressive
and
affecting
dignity
than
the
*NL*
plain
old
Doctor
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
prepared
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
to
deny
--
perhaps
I
may
have
been
,
*NL*
without
knowing
it
,
in
some
degree
prepared
to
admit
--
that
I
may
have
*NL*
unwittingly
ensnared
that
lady
into
an
unhappy
marriage
.
I
am
a
man
*NL*
quite
unaccustomed
to
observe
;
and
I
can
not
but
believe
that
the
*NL*
observation
of
several
people
,
of
different
ages
and
positions
,
all
too
*NL*
plainly
tending
in
one
direction
-LRB-
and
that
so
natural
-RRB-
,
is
better
than
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
often
admired
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
described
,
his
benignant
manner
*NL*
towards
his
youthful
wife
;
but
the
respectful
tenderness
he
manifested
*NL*
in
every
reference
to
her
on
this
occasion
,
and
the
almost
reverential
*NL*
manner
in
which
he
put
away
from
him
the
lightest
doubt
of
her
*NL*
integrity
,
exalted
him
,
in
my
eyes
,
beyond
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
married
that
lady
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
``
when
she
was
extremely
young
.
I
*NL*
took
her
to
myself
when
her
character
was
scarcely
formed
.
So
far
as
it
*NL*
was
developed
,
it
had
been
my
happiness
to
form
it
.
I
knew
her
father
*NL*
well
.
I
knew
her
well
.
I
had
taught
her
what
I
could
,
for
the
love
of
*NL*
all
her
beautiful
and
virtuous
qualities
.
If
I
did
her
wrong
;
as
I
fear
*NL*
I
did
,
in
taking
advantage
-LRB-
but
I
never
meant
it
-RRB-
of
her
gratitude
and
*NL*
her
affection
;
I
ask
pardon
of
that
lady
,
in
my
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
across
the
room
,
and
came
back
to
the
same
place
;
holding
the
*NL*
chair
with
a
grasp
that
trembled
,
like
his
subdued
voice
,
in
its
*NL*
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
regarded
myself
as
a
refuge
,
for
her
,
from
the
dangers
and
*NL*
vicissitudes
of
life
.
I
persuaded
myself
that
,
unequal
though
we
were
in
*NL*
years
,
she
would
live
tranquilly
and
contentedly
with
me
.
I
did
not
shut
*NL*
out
of
my
consideration
the
time
when
I
should
leave
her
free
,
and
still
*NL*
young
and
still
beautiful
,
but
with
her
judgment
more
matured
--
no
,
*NL*
gentlemen
--
upon
my
truth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
homely
figure
seemed
to
be
lightened
up
by
his
fidelity
and
*NL*
generosity
.
Every
word
he
uttered
had
a
force
that
no
other
grace
could
*NL*
have
imparted
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
with
this
lady
has
been
very
happy
.
Until
to-night
,
I
have
had
*NL*
uninterrupted
occasion
to
bless
the
day
on
which
I
did
her
great
*NL*
injustice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
,
more
and
more
faltering
in
the
utterance
of
these
words
,
*NL*
stopped
for
a
few
moments
;
then
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
awakened
from
my
dream
--
I
have
been
a
poor
dreamer
,
in
one
way
or
*NL*
other
,
all
my
life
--
I
see
how
natural
it
is
that
she
should
have
some
*NL*
regretful
feeling
towards
her
old
companion
and
her
equal
.
That
she
does
*NL*
regard
him
with
some
innocent
regret
,
with
some
blameless
thoughts
of
*NL*
what
might
have
been
,
but
for
me
,
is
,
I
fear
,
too
true
.
Much
that
I
have
*NL*
seen
,
but
not
noted
,
has
come
back
upon
me
with
new
meaning
,
during
this
*NL*
last
trying
hour
.
But
,
beyond
this
,
gentlemen
,
the
dear
lady
's
name
*NL*
never
must
be
coupled
with
a
word
,
a
breath
,
of
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
little
while
,
his
eye
kindled
and
his
voice
was
firm
;
for
a
little
*NL*
while
he
was
again
silent
.
Presently
,
he
proceeded
as
before
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
only
remains
for
me
,
to
bear
the
knowledge
of
the
unhappiness
I
have
*NL*
occasioned
,
as
submissively
as
I
can
.
It
is
she
who
should
reproach
;
not
*NL*
I.
To
save
her
from
misconstruction
,
cruel
misconstruction
,
that
even
my
*NL*
friends
have
not
been
able
to
avoid
,
becomes
my
duty
.
The
more
retired
*NL*
we
live
,
the
better
I
shall
discharge
it
.
And
when
the
time
comes
--
may
*NL*
it
come
soon
,
if
it
be
His
merciful
pleasure
!
--
when
my
death
shall
*NL*
release
her
from
constraint
,
I
shall
close
my
eyes
upon
her
honored
*NL*
face
,
with
unbounded
confidence
and
love
;
and
leave
her
,
with
no
sorrow
*NL*
then
,
to
happier
and
brighter
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
see
him
for
the
tears
which
his
earnestness
and
goodness
,
so
*NL*
adorned
by
,
and
so
adorning
,
the
perfect
simplicity
of
his
manner
,
*NL*
brought
into
my
eyes
.
He
had
moved
to
the
door
,
when
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
I
have
shown
you
my
heart

I
am
sure
you
will
respect
it

What

said
to-night

never

me
*NL*
an
old
friend
's
arm
up-stairs

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
hastened
to
him
.
Without
interchanging
a
word
they
went
*NL*
slowly
out
of
the
room
together
,
Uriah
looking
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Master
Copperfield

said
Uriah
,
meekly
turning
to
me
.
``
The

Scholar

what
an

is
as
blind
as

family
's
out

cart

*NL*
*NL*
I
needed
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
to
be
so
madly
enraged
as
I
never
*NL*
was
before
,
and
never
have
been
since

*NL*
*NL*
``

,
you
false
rascal
,
as
if
we
*NL*
had
been
in
discussion
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
stood
,
front
to
front
,
I
saw
so
plainly
,
in
the
stealthy
*NL*
exultation
of
his
face
,
what
I
already
so
plainly
knew
;
I
mean
that
he
*NL*
forced
his
confidence
upon
me
,
expressly
to
make
me
miserable
,
and
had
*NL*
set
a
deliberate
trap
for
me
in
this
very
matter
;
that
I
could
n't
bear
*NL*
it
.
The
whole
of
his
lank
cheek
was
invitingly
before
me
,
and
I
struck
*NL*
it
with
my
open
hand
with
that
force
that
my
fingers
tingled
as
if
I
had
*NL*
burnt
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
the
hand
in
his
,
and
we
stood
,
in
that
connexion
,
looking
at
*NL*
each
other
.
We
stood
so
,
a
long
time
;
long
enough
for
me
to
see
the
*NL*
white
marks
of
my
fingers
die
out
of
the
deep
red
of
his
cheek
,
and
*NL*
leave
it
a
deeper
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
''
he
said
at
length
,
in
a
breathless
voice
,
``
have
you
taken
*NL*
leave
of
your
senses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
taken
leave
of
you
,
''
said
I
,
wresting
my
hand
away
.
``
You
dog
,
*NL*
I
'll
know
no
more
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
?
''
said
he
,
constrained
by
the
pain
of
his
cheek
to
put
his
*NL*
hand
there
.
``
Perhaps
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
help
it
.
Is
n't
this
ungrateful
*NL*
of
you
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
shown
you
often
enough
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
despise
you
.
I
have
*NL*
shown
you
now
,
more
plainly
,
that
I
do
.
Why
should
I
dread
your
doing
*NL*
your
worst
to
all
about
you
?
What
else
do
you
ever
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
perfectly
understood
this
allusion
to
the
considerations
that
had
*NL*
hitherto
restrained
me
in
my
communications
with
him
.
I
rather
think
*NL*
that
neither
the
blow
,
nor
the
allusion
,
would
have
escaped
me
,
but
for
*NL*
the
assurance
I
had
had
from
Agnes
that
night
.
It
is
no
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
long
pause
.
His
eyes
,
as
he
looked
at
me
,
seemed
to
*NL*
take
every
shade
of
color
that
could
make
eyes
ugly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
''
he
said
,
removing
his
hand
from
his
cheek
,
``
you
have
*NL*
always
gone
against
me
.
I
know
you
always
used
to
be
against
me
at
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
think
what
you
like
,
''
said
I
,
still
in
a
towering
rage
.
``
If
it
*NL*
is
not
true
,
so
much
the
worthier
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
always
liked
you
,
Copperfield
!
''
he
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
deigned
to
make
him
no
reply
;
and
,
taking
up
my
hat
,
was
going
out
to
*NL*
bed
,
when
he
came
between
me
and
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
must
be
two
parties
to
a
quarrel
.
I
wo
n't
*NL*
be
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
to
the
devil
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
!
''
he
replied
.
``
I
know
you
'll
be
sorry
afterwards
.
How
*NL*
can
you
make
yourself
so
inferior
to
me
,
as
to
show
such
a
bad
spirit
?
*NL*
But
I
forgive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forgive
me
!
''
I
repeated
disdainfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
and
you
ca
n't
help
yourself
,
''
replied
Uriah
.
``
To
think
of
your
*NL*
going
and
attacking
_
me
_
,
that
have
always
been
a
friend
to
you

But
*NL*
there
ca
n't
be
a
quarrel
without
two
parties
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
one
.
I
will
*NL*
be
a
friend
to
you
,
in
spite
of
you
.
So
now
you
know
what
you
've
got
to
*NL*
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
necessity
of
carrying
on
this
dialogue
-LRB-
his
part
in
which
was
very
*NL*
slow
;
mine
very
quick
-RRB-
in
a
low
tone
,
that
the
house
might
not
be
*NL*
disturbed
at
an
unseasonable
hour
,
did
not
improve
my
temper
;
though
my
*NL*
passion
was
cooling
down
.
Merely
telling
him
that
I
should
expect
from
*NL*
him
what
I
always
had
expected
,
and
had
never
yet
been
disappointed
in
,
*NL*
I
opened
the
door
upon
him
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
great
walnut
put
there
*NL*
to
be
cracked
,
and
went
out
of
the
house
.
But
he
slept
out
of
the
house
*NL*
too
,
at
his
mother
's
lodging
;
and
before
I
had
gone
many
hundred
yards
,
*NL*
came
up
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Copperfield
,
''
he
said
,
in
my
ear
-LRB-
I
did
not
turn
my
head
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
you
're
in
quite
a
wrong
position
;
''
which
I
felt
to
be
true
,
and
that
*NL*
made
me
chafe
the
more
;
``
you
ca
n't
make
this
a
brave
thing
,
and
you
*NL*
ca
n't
help
being
forgiven
.
I
do
n't
intend
to
mention
it
to
mother
,
nor
*NL*
to
any
living
soul
.
I
'm
determined
to
forgive
you
.
But
I
do
wonder
that
*NL*
you
should
lift
your
hand
against
a
person
that
you
knew
to
be
so
*NL*
umble
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
only
less
mean
than
he
.
He
knew
me
better
than
I
knew
myself
.
If
*NL*
he
had
retorted
,
or
openly
exasperated
me
,
it
would
have
been
a
relief
*NL*
and
a
justification
;
but
he
had
put
me
on
a
slow
fire
,
on
which
I
lay
*NL*
tormented
half
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
I
came
out
,
the
early
church
bell
was
ringing
,
and
*NL*
he
was
walking
up
and
down
with
his
mother
.
He
addressed
me
as
if
*NL*
nothing
had
happened
,
and
I
could
do
no
less
than
reply
.
I
had
struck
*NL*
him
hard
enough
to
give
him
the
toothache
,
I
suppose
.
At
all
events
his
*NL*
face
was
tied
up
in
a
black
silk
handkerchief
,
which
,
with
his
hat
*NL*
perched
on
the
top
of
it
,
was
far
from
improving
his
appearance
.
I
heard
*NL*
that
he
went
to
a
dentist
's
in
London
on
the
Monday
morning
,
and
had
a
*NL*
tooth
out
.
I
hope
it
was
a
double
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
gave
out
that
he
was
not
quite
well
;
and
remained
alone
,
for
*NL*
a
considerable
part
of
every
day
,
during
the
remainder
of
the
visit
.
*NL*
Agnes
and
her
father
had
been
gone
a
week
,
before
we
resumed
our
usual
*NL*
work
.
On
the
day
preceding
its
resumption
,
the
Doctor
gave
me
with
his
*NL*
own
hands
a
folded
note
not
sealed
.
It
was
addressed
to
myself
;
and
laid
*NL*
an
injunction
on
me
,
in
a
few
affectionate
words
,
never
to
refer
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
that
evening
.
I
had
confided
it
to
my
aunt
,
but
to
no
one
*NL*
else
.
It
was
not
a
subject
I
could
discuss
with
Agnes
,
and
Agnes
*NL*
certainly
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
what
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
,
I
felt
convinced
,
had
Mrs.
Strong
then
.
Several
weeks
elapsed
*NL*
before
I
saw
the
least
change
in
her
.
It
came
on
slowly
,
like
a
cloud
*NL*
when
there
is
no
wind
.
At
first
,
she
seemed
to
wonder
at
the
gentle
*NL*
compassion
with
which
the
Doctor
spoke
to
her
,
and
at
his
wish
that
she
*NL*
should
have
her
mother
with
her
,
to
relieve
the
dull
monotony
of
her
*NL*
life
.
Often
,
when
we
were
at
work
,
and
she
was
sitting
by
,
I
would
see
*NL*
her
pausing
and
looking
at
him
with
that
memorable
face
.
Afterwards
,
I
*NL*
sometimes
observed
her
rise
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
,
and
go
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
Gradually
,
an
unhappy
shadow
fell
upon
her
beauty
,
and
*NL*
deepened
every
day
.
Mrs.
Markleham
was
a
regular
inmate
of
the
cottage
*NL*
then
;
but
she
talked
and
talked
,
and
saw
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
change
stole
on
Annie
,
once
like
sunshine
in
the
Doctor
's
house
,
*NL*
the
Doctor
became
older
in
appearance
,
and
more
grave
;
but
the
sweetness
*NL*
of
his
temper
,
the
placid
kindness
of
his
manner
,
and
his
benevolent
*NL*
solicitude
for
her
,
if
they
were
capable
of
any
increase
,
were
*NL*
increased
.
I
saw
him
once
,
early
on
the
morning
of
her
birthday
,
when
*NL*
she
came
to
sit
in
the
window
while
we
were
at
work
-LRB-
which
she
had
*NL*
always
done
,
but
now
began
to
do
with
a
timid
and
uncertain
air
that
I
*NL*
thought
very
touching
-RRB-
,
take
her
forehead
between
his
hands
,
kiss
it
,
*NL*
and
go
hurriedly
away
,
too
much
moved
to
remain
.
I
saw
her
stand
where
*NL*
he
had
left
her
,
like
a
statue
;
and
then
bend
down
her
head
,
and
clasp
*NL*
her
hands
,
and
weep
,
I
can
not
say
how
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
after
that
,
I
fancied
that
she
tried
to
speak
even
to
me
,
in
*NL*
intervals
when
we
were
left
alone
.
But
she
never
uttered
word
.
The
*NL*
Doctor
always
had
some
new
project
for
her
participating
in
amusements
*NL*
away
from
home
,
with
her
mother
;
and
Mrs.
Markleham
,
who
was
very
fond
*NL*
of
amusements
,
and
very
easily
dissatisfied
with
anything
else
,
entered
*NL*
into
them
with
great
good
will
,
and
was
loud
in
her
commendations
.
But
*NL*
Annie
,
in
a
spiritless
unhappy
way
,
only
went
whither
she
was
led
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
have
no
care
for
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
know
what
to
think
.
Neither
did
my
aunt
;
who
must
have
walked
,
*NL*
at
various
times
,
a
hundred
miles
in
her
uncertainty
.
What
was
strangest
*NL*
of
all
was
,
that
the
only
real
relief
which
seemed
to
make
its
way
into
*NL*
the
secret
region
of
this
domestic
unhappiness
,
made
its
way
there
in
*NL*
the
person
of
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
his
thoughts
were
on
the
subject
,
or
what
his
observation
was
,
I
am
*NL*
as
unable
to
explain
,
as
I
dare
say
he
would
have
been
to
assist
me
in
*NL*
the
task
.
But
,
as
I
have
recorded
in
the
narrative
of
my
school
days
,
*NL*
his
veneration
for
the
Doctor
was
unbounded
;
and
there
is
a
subtlety
of
*NL*
perception
in
real
attachment
,
even
when
it
is
borne
towards
man
by
one
*NL*
of
the
lower
animals
,
which
leaves
the
highest
intellect
behind
.
To
this
*NL*
mind
of
the
heart
,
if
I
may
call
it
so
,
in
Mr.
Dick
,
some
bright
ray
of
*NL*
the
truth
shot
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
proudly
resumed
his
privilege
,
in
many
of
his
spare
hours
,
of
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
the
garden
with
the
Doctor
;
as
he
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
pace
up
and
down
The
Doctor
's
Walk
at
Canterbury
.
But
*NL*
matters
were
no
sooner
in
this
state
,
than
he
devoted
all
his
spare
time
*NL*
-LRB-
and
got
up
earlier
to
make
it
more
-RRB-
to
these
perambulations
.
If
he
had
*NL*
never
been
so
happy
as
when
the
Doctor
read
that
marvellous
performance
,
*NL*
the
Dictionary
,
to
him
;
he
was
now
quite
miserable
unless
the
Doctor
*NL*
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
began
.
When
the
Doctor
and
I
were
*NL*
engaged
,
he
now
fell
into
the
custom
of
walking
up
and
down
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Strong
,
and
helping
her
to
trim
her
favorite
flowers
,
or
weed
the
beds
.
*NL*
I
dare
say
he
rarely
spoke
a
dozen
words
in
an
hour
:
but
his
quiet
*NL*
interest
,
and
his
wistful
face
,
found
immediate
response
in
both
their
*NL*
breasts
;
each
knew
that
the
other
liked
him
,
and
that
he
loved
both
;
and
*NL*
he
became
what
no
one
else
could
be
--
a
link
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
think
of
him
,
with
his
impenetrably
wise
face
,
walking
up
and
*NL*
down
with
the
Doctor
,
delighted
to
be
battered
by
the
hard
words
in
the
*NL*
Dictionary
;
when
I
think
of
him
carrying
huge
watering-pots
after
Annie
;
*NL*
kneeling
down
,
in
very
paws
of
gloves
,
at
patient
microscopic
work
among
*NL*
the
little
leaves
;
expressing
as
no
philosopher
could
have
expressed
,
in
*NL*
every
thing
he
did
,
a
delicate
desire
to
be
her
friend
;
showering
*NL*
sympathy
,
trustfulness
,
and
affection
,
out
of
every
hole
in
the
*NL*
watering-pot
;
when
I
think
of
him
never
wandering
in
that
better
mind
of
*NL*
his
to
which
unhappiness
addressed
itself
,
never
bringing
the
*NL*
unfortunate
King
Charles
into
the
garden
,
never
wavering
in
his
grateful
*NL*
service
,
never
diverted
from
his
knowledge
that
there
was
something
*NL*
wrong
,
or
from
his
wish
to
set
it
right
--
I
really
feel
almost
ashamed
of
*NL*
having
known
that
he
was
not
quite
in
his
wits
,
taking
account
of
the
*NL*
utmost
I
have
done
with
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
but
myself
,
Trot
,
knows
what
that
man
is
!
''
my
aunt
would
proudly
*NL*
remark
,
when
we
conversed
about
it
.
``
Dick
will
distinguish
himself
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
refer
to
one
other
topic
before
I
close
this
chapter
.
While
the
*NL*
visit
at
the
Doctor
's
was
still
in
progress
,
I
observed
that
the
postman
*NL*
brought
two
or
three
letters
every
morning
for
Uriah
Heep
,
who
remained
*NL*
at
Highgate
until
the
rest
went
back
,
it
being
a
leisure
time
;
and
that
*NL*
these
were
always
directed
in
a
business-like
manner
by
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
who
now
assumed
a
round
legal
hand
.
I
was
glad
to
infer
,
from
these
*NL*
slight
premises
,
that
Mr.
Micawber
was
doing
well
;
and
consequently
was
*NL*
much
surprised
to
receive
,
about
this
time
,
the
following
letter
from
*NL*
his
amiable
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
CANTERBURY
,
_
Monday
Evening
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
doubtless
be
surprised
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
to
*NL*
receive
this
communication
.
Still
more
so
,
by
its
contents
.
Still
*NL*
more
so
,
by
the
stipulation
of
implicit
confidence
which
I
beg
to
*NL*
impose
.
But
my
feelings
as
a
wife
and
mother
require
relief
;
and
*NL*
as
I
do
not
wish
to
consult
my
family
-LRB-
already
obnoxious
to
the
*NL*
feelings
of
Mr.
Micawber
-RRB-
,
I
know
no
one
of
whom
I
can
better
ask
*NL*
advice
than
my
friend
and
former
lodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
aware
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
that
between
myself
*NL*
and
Mr.
Micawber
-LRB-
whom
I
will
never
desert
-RRB-
,
there
has
always
been
*NL*
preserved
a
spirit
of
mutual
confidence
.
Mr.
Micawber
may
have
*NL*
occasionally
given
a
bill
without
consulting
me
,
or
he
may
have
*NL*
misled
me
as
to
the
period
when
that
obligation
would
become
due
.
*NL*
This
has
actually
happened
.
But
,
in
general
,
Mr.
Micawber
has
had
*NL*
no
secrets
from
the
bosom
of
affection
--
I
allude
to
his
wife
--
and
*NL*
has
invariably
,
on
our
retirement
to
rest
,
recalled
the
events
of
*NL*
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
picture
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
what
the
*NL*
poignancy
of
my
feelings
must
be
,
when
I
inform
you
that
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
is
entirely
changed
.
He
is
reserved
.
He
is
secret
.
His
*NL*
life
is
a
mystery
to
the
partner
of
his
joys
and
sorrows
--
I
again
*NL*
allude
to
his
wife
--
and
if
I
should
assure
you
that
beyond
knowing
*NL*
that
it
is
passed
from
morning
to
night
at
the
office
,
I
now
know
*NL*
less
of
it
than
I
do
of
the
man
in
the
south
,
connected
with
whose
*NL*
mouth
the
thoughtless
children
repeat
an
idle
tale
respecting
cold
*NL*
plum
porridge
,
I
should
adopt
a
popular
fallacy
to
express
an
*NL*
actual
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
not
all
.
Mr.
Micawber
is
morose
.
He
is
severe
.
He
*NL*
is
estranged
from
our
eldest
son
and
daughter
,
he
has
no
pride
*NL*
in
his
twins
,
he
looks
with
an
eye
of
coldness
even
on
the
*NL*
unoffending
stranger
who
last
became
a
member
of
our
circle
.
The
*NL*
pecuniary
means
of
meeting
our
expenses
,
kept
down
to
the
utmost
*NL*
farthing
,
are
obtained
from
him
with
great
difficulty
,
and
even
*NL*
under
fearful
threats
that
he
will
Settle
himself
-LRB-
the
exact
*NL*
expression
-RRB-
;
and
he
inexorably
refuses
to
give
any
explanation
*NL*
whatever
of
this
distracting
policy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
hard
to
bear
.
This
is
heart-breaking
.
If
you
will
advise
*NL*
me
,
knowing
my
feeble
powers
such
as
they
are
,
how
you
think
it
*NL*
will
be
best
to
exert
them
in
a
dilemma
so
unwonted
,
you
will
*NL*
add
another
friendly
obligation
to
the
many
you
have
already
*NL*
rendered
me
.
With
loves
from
the
children
,
and
a
smile
from
the
*NL*
happily-unconscious
stranger
,
I
remain
,
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
afflicted

*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
feel
justified
in
giving
a
wife
of
Mrs.
Micawber
's
experience
*NL*
any
other
recommendation
,
than
that
she
should
try
to
reclaim
Mr.

Micawber
by
patience
and
kindness
-LRB-
as
I
knew
she
would
in

thinking

very
much

CHAPTER
XLIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
ANOTHER
RETROSPECT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Once
again
,
let
me
pause
upon
a
memorable
period
of
my
life
.
Let
me
*NL*
stand
aside
,
to
see
the
phantoms
of
those
days
go
by
me
,
accompanying
*NL*
the
shadow
of
myself
,
in
dim
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weeks
,
months
,
seasons
,
pass
along
.
They
seem
little
more
than
a
summer
*NL*
day
and
a
winter
evening
.
Now
,
the
Common
where
I
walk
with
Dora
is
all
*NL*
in
bloom
,
a
field
of
bright
gold
;
and
now
the
unseen
heather
lies
in
*NL*
mounds
and
bunches
underneath
a
covering
of
snow
.
In
a
breath
,
the
river
*NL*
that
flows
through
our
Sunday
walks
is
sparkling
in
the
summer
sun
,
is
*NL*
ruffled
by
the
winter
wind
,
or
thickened
with
drifting
heaps
of
ice
.
*NL*
Faster
than
ever
river
ran
towards
the
sea
,
it
flashes
,
darkens
,
and
*NL*
rolls
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
thread
changes
,
in
the
house
of
the
two
little
bird-like
ladies
.
*NL*
The
clock
ticks
over
the
fire-place
,
the
weather-glass
hangs
in
the
*NL*
hall
.
Neither
clock
nor
weather-glass
is
ever
right
;
but
we
believe
in
*NL*
both
,
devoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
come
legally
to
man
's
estate
.
I
have
attained
the
dignity
of
*NL*
twenty-one
.
But
this
is
a
sort
of
dignity
that
may
be
thrust
upon
one
.
*NL*
Let
me
think
what
I
have
achieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
tamed
that
savage
stenographic
mystery
.
I
make
a
respectable
*NL*
income
by
it
.
I
am
in
high
repute
for
my
accomplishment
in
all
*NL*
pertaining
to
the
art
,
and
am
joined
with
eleven
others
in
reporting
the
*NL*
debates
in
Parliament
for
a
Morning
Newspaper
.
Night
after
night
,
I
*NL*
record
predictions
that
never
come
to
pass
,
professions
that
are
never
*NL*
fulfilled
,
explanations
that
are
only
meant
to
mystify
.
I
wallow
in
*NL*
words
.
Britannia
,
that
unfortunate
female
,
is
always
before
me
,
like
a
*NL*
trussed
fowl
:
skewered
through
and
through
with
office-pens
,
and
bound
*NL*
hand
and
foot
with
red
tape
.
I
am
sufficiently
behind
the
scenes
to
know
*NL*
the
worth
of
political
life
.
I
am
quite
an
Infidel
about
it
,
and
shall
*NL*
never
be
converted
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
old
Traddles
has
tried
his
hand
at
the
same
pursuit
,
but
it
is
*NL*
not
in
Traddles
's
way
.
He
is
perfectly
good-humoured
respecting
his
*NL*
failure
,
and
reminds
me
that
he
always
did
consider
himself
slow
.
He
has
*NL*
occasional
employment
on
the
same
newspaper
,
in
getting
up
the
facts
of
*NL*
dry
subjects
,
to
be
written
about
and
embellished
by
more
fertile
minds
.
*NL*
He
is
called
to
the
bar
;
and
with
admirable
industry
and
self-denial
has
*NL*
scraped
another
hundred
pounds
together
,
to
fee
a
Conveyancer
whose
*NL*
chambers
he
attends
.
A
great
deal
of
very
hot
port
wine
was
consumed
at
*NL*
his
call
;
and
,
considering
the
figure
,
I
should
think
the
Inner
Temple
*NL*
must
have
made
a
profit
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
come
out
in
another
way
.
I
have
taken
with
fear
and
trembling
to
*NL*
authorship
.
I
wrote
a
little
something
,
in
secret
,
and
sent
it
to
a
*NL*
magazine
,
and
it
was
published
in
the
magazine
.
Since
then
,
I
have
taken
*NL*
heart
to
write
a
good
many
trifling
pieces
.
Now
,
I
am
regularly
paid
for
*NL*
them
.
Altogether
,
I
am
well
off
;
when
I
tell
my
income
on
the
fingers
of
*NL*
my
left
hand
,
I
pass
the
third
finger
and
take
in
the
fourth
to
the
*NL*
middle
joint
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
removed
,
from
Buckingham
Street
,
to
a
pleasant
little
cottage
*NL*
very
near
the
one
I
looked
at
,
when
my
enthusiasm
first
came
on
.
My
*NL*
aunt
,
however
-LRB-
who
has
sold
the
house
at
Dover
,
to
good
advantage
-RRB-
,
is
*NL*
not
going
to
remain
here
,
but
intends
removing
herself
to
a
still
more
*NL*
tiny
cottage
close
at
hand
.
What
does
this
portend
?
My
marriage
?
Yes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
!
I
am
going
to
be
married
to
Dora
!
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
*NL*
have
given
their
consent
;
and
if
ever
canary
birds
were
in
a
flutter
,
*NL*
they
are
.
Miss
Lavinia
,
self-charged
with
the
superintendence
of
my
*NL*
darling
's
wardrobe
,
is
constantly
cutting
out
brown-paper
cuirasses
,
*NL*
and
differing
in
opinion
from
a
highly
respectable
young
man
,
with
a
*NL*
long
bundle
,
and
a
yard
measure
under
his
arm
.
A
dressmaker
,
always
*NL*
stabbed
in
the
breast
with
a
needle
and
thread
,
boards
and
lodges
in
*NL*
the
house
;
and
seems
to
me
,
eating
,
drinking
,
or
sleeping
,
never
to
*NL*
take
her
thimble
off
.
They
make
a
lay-figure
of
my
dear
.
They
are
*NL*
always
sending
for
her
to
come
and
try
something
on
.
We
ca
n't
be
happy
*NL*
together
for
five
minutes
in
the
evening
,
but
some
intrusive
female
*NL*
knocks
at
the
door
,
and
says
,
``
Oh
,
if
you
please
,
Miss
Dora
,
would
you
*NL*
step
up-stairs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Clarissa
and
my
aunt
roam
all
over
London
,
to
find
out
articles
of
*NL*
furniture
for
Dora
and
me
to
look
at
.
It
would
be
better
for
them
to
buy
*NL*
the
goods
at
once
,
without
this
ceremony
of
inspection
;
for
,
when
we
go
*NL*
to
see
a
kitchen
fender
and
meat-screen
,
Dora
sees
a
Chinese
house
for
*NL*
Jip
,
with
little
bells
on
the
top
,
and
prefers
that
.
And
it
takes
a
long
*NL*
time
to
accustom
Jip
to
his
new
residence
,
after
we
have
bought
it
;
*NL*
whenever
he
goes
in
or
out
,
he
makes
all
the
little
bells
ring
,
and
is
*NL*
horribly
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peggotty
comes
up
to
make
herself
useful
,
and
falls
to
work
immediately
.
*NL*
Her
department
appears
to
be
,
to
clean
everything
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
She
rubs
everything
that
can
be
rubbed
,
until
it
shines
,
like
her
own
*NL*
honest
forehead
,
with
perpetual
friction
.
And
now
it
is
,
that
I
begin
to
*NL*
see
her
solitary
brother
passing
through
the
dark
streets
at
night
,
and
*NL*
looking
,
as
he
goes
,
among
the
wandering
faces
.
I
never
speak
to
him
at
*NL*
such
an
hour
.
I
know
too
well
,
as
his
grave
figure
passes
onward
,
what
*NL*
he
seeks
,
and
what
he
dreads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
does
Traddles
look
so
important
when
he
calls
upon
me
this
afternoon
*NL*
in
the
Commons
--
where
I
still
occasionally
attend
,
for
form
's
sake
,
when
*NL*
I
have
time
?
The
realisation
of
my
boyish
day-dreams
is
at
hand
.
I
am
*NL*
going
to
take
out
the
license
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
little
document
to
do
so
much
;
and
Traddles
contemplates
it
,
as
*NL*
it
lies
upon
my
desk
,
half
in
admiration
,
half
in
awe
.
There
are
the
*NL*
names
,
in
the
sweet
old
visionary
connexion
,
David
Copperfield
and
Dora
*NL*
Spenlow
;
and
there
,
in
the
corner
,
is
that
Parental
Institution
,
the
*NL*
Stamp
Office
,
which
is
so
benignantly
interested
in
the
various
*NL*
transactions
of
human
life
,
looking
down
upon
our
Union
;
and
there
is
*NL*
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
invoking
a
blessing
on
us
in
print
,
and
*NL*
doing
it
as
cheap
as
could
possibly
be
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
I
am
in
a
dream
,
a
flustered
,
happy
,
hurried
dream
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
believe
that
it
is
going
to
be
;
and
yet
I
ca
n't
believe
but
that
*NL*
everyone
I
pass
in
the
street
,
must
have
some
kind
of
perception
,
that
I
*NL*
am
to
be
married
the
day
after
to-morrow
.
The
Surrogate
knows
me
,
when
I
*NL*
go
down
to
be
sworn
;
and
disposes
of
me
easily
,
as
if
there
were
a
*NL*
Masonic
understanding
between
us
.
Traddles
is
not
at
all
wanted
,
but
is
*NL*
in
attendance
as
my
general
backer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
the
next
time
you
come
here
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
I
say
to
Traddles
,
*NL*
``
it
will
be
on
the
same
errand
for
yourself
.
And
I
hope
it
will
be
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
your
good
wishes
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
''
he
replies
.
``
I
*NL*
hope
so
too
.
It
's
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
she
'll
wait
for
me
any
*NL*
length
of
time
,
and
that
she
really
is
the
dearest
girl
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
to
meet
her
at
the
coach
?
''
I
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
seven
,
''
says
Traddles
,
looking
at
his
plain
old
silver
watch
--
the
*NL*
very
watch
he
once
took
a
wheel
out
of
,
at
school
,
to
make
a
water-mill
.
*NL*
``
That
is
about
Miss
Wickfield
's
time
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
earlier
.
Her
time
is
half-past
eight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
boy
,
''
says
Traddles
,
``
I
am
almost
as
pleased
as
*NL*
if
I
were
going
to
be
married
myself
,
to
think
that
this
event
is
coming
*NL*
to
such
a
happy
termination
.
And
really
the
great
friendship
and
*NL*
consideration
of
personally
associating
Sophy
with
the
joyful
occasion
,
*NL*
and
inviting
her
to
be
a
bridesmaid
in
conjunction
with
Miss
Wickfield
,
*NL*
demands
my
warmest
thanks
.
I
am
extremely
sensible
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hear
him
,
and
shake
hands
with
him
;
and
we
talk
,
and
walk
,
and
dine
,
*NL*
and
so
on
;
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
Nothing
is
real
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophy
arrives
at
the
house
of
Dora
's
aunts
,
in
due
course
.
She
has
the
*NL*
most
agreeable
of
faces
,
--
not
absolutely
beautiful
,
but
extraordinarily
*NL*
pleasant
,
--
and
is
one
of
the
most
genial
,
unaffected
,
frank
,
engaging
*NL*
creatures
I
have
ever
seen
.
Traddles
presents
her
to
us
with
great
*NL*
pride
;
and
rubs
his
hands
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
,
with
every
*NL*
individual
hair
upon
his
head
standing
on
tiptoe
,
when
I
congratulate
*NL*
him
in
a
corner
on
his
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
brought
Agnes
from
the
Canterbury
coach
,
and
her
cheerful
and
*NL*
beautiful
face
is
among
us
for
the
second
time
.
Agnes
has
a
great
liking
*NL*
for
Traddles
,
and
it
is
capital
to
see
them
meet
,
and
to
observe
the
*NL*
glory
of
Traddles
as
he
commends
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
to
her
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
We
have
a
delightful
evening
,
and
are
*NL*
supremely
happy
;
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
yet
.
I
ca
n't
collect
myself
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
check
off
my
happiness
as
it
takes
place
.
I
feel
in
a
misty
and
*NL*
unsettled
kind
of
state
;
as
if
I
had
got
up
very
early
in
the
morning
a
*NL*
week
or
two
ago
,
and
had
never
been
to
bed
since
.
I
ca
n't
make
out
when
*NL*
yesterday
was
.
I
seem
to
have
been
carrying
the
licence
about
,
in
my
*NL*
pocket
,
many
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
too
,
when
we
all
go
in
a
flock
to
see
the
house
--
our
*NL*
house
--
Dora
's
and
mine
--
I
am
quite
unable
to
regard
myself
as
its
*NL*
master
.
I
seem
to
be
there
,
by
permission
of
somebody
else
.
I
half
*NL*
expect
the
real
master
to
come
home
presently
,
and
say
he
is
glad
*NL*
to
see
me
.
Such
a
beautiful
little
house
as
it
is
,
with
everything
*NL*
so
bright
and
new
;
with
the
flowers
on
the
carpets
looking
as
if
*NL*
freshly
gathered
,
and
the
green
leaves
on
the
paper
as
if
they
had
*NL*
just
come
out
;
with
the
spotless
muslin
curtains
,
and
the
blushing
*NL*
rose-coloured
furniture
,
and
Dora
's
garden
hat
with
the
blue
ribbon
--
do
*NL*
I
remember
,
now
,
how
I
loved
her
in
such
another
hat
when
I
first
knew
*NL*
her
!
--
already
hanging
on
its
little
peg
;
the
guitar-case
quite
at
home
*NL*
on
its
heels
in
a
corner
;
and
everybody
tumbling
over
Jip
's
Pagoda
,
*NL*
which
is
much
too
big
for
the
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
happy
evening
,
quite
as
unreal
as
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
I
*NL*
steal
into
the
usual
room
before
going
away
.
Dora
is
not
there
.
I
*NL*
suppose
they
have
not
done
trying
on
yet
.
Miss
Lavinia
peeps
in
,
and
*NL*
tells
me
mysteriously
that
she
will
not
be
long
.
She
is
rather
long
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
;
but
by-and-by
I
hear
a
rustling
at
the
door
,
and
some
*NL*
one
taps
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
say
,
``
Come
in
!
''
but
some
one
taps
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
go
to
the
door
,
wondering
who
it
is
;
there
,
I
meet
a
pair
of
bright
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
blushing
face
;
they
are
Dora
's
eyes
and
face
,
and
Miss
*NL*
Lavinia
has
dressed
her
in
to-morrow
's
dress
,
bonnet
and
all
,
for
me
to
*NL*
see
.
I
take
my
little
wife
to
my
heart
;
and
Miss
Lavinia
gives
a
little
*NL*
scream
because
I
tumble
the
bonnet
,
and
Dora
laughs
and
cries
at
once
,
*NL*
because
I
am
so
pleased
;
and
I
believe
it
less
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
pretty
,
Doady
?
''
says
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pretty
!
I
should
rather
think
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
sure
you
like
me
very
much
?
''
says
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
topic
is
fraught
with
such
danger
to
the
bonnet
,
that
Miss
Lavinia
*NL*
gives
another
little
scream
,
and
begs
me
to
understand
that
Dora
is
only
*NL*
to
be
looked
at
,
and
on
no
account
to
be
touched
.
So
Dora
stands
in
a
*NL*
delightful
state
of
confusion
for
a
minute
or
two
,
to
be
admired
;
and
*NL*
then
takes
off
her
bonnet
--
looking
so
natural
without
it
!
--
and
runs
away
*NL*
with
it
in
her
hand
;
and
comes
dancing
down
again
in
her
own
familiar
*NL*
dress
,
and
asks
Jip
if
I
have
got
a
beautiful
little
wife
,
and
whether
*NL*
he
'll
forgive
her
for
being
married
,
and
kneels
down
to
make
him
stand
*NL*
upon
the
cookery-book
,
for
the
last
time
in
her
single
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
go
home
,
more
incredulous
than
ever
,
to
a
lodging
that
I
have
hard
by
;
*NL*
and
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
,
to
ride
to
the
Highgate
road
and
*NL*
fetch
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
seen
my
aunt
in
such
state
.
She
is
dressed
in
*NL*
lavender-colored
silk
,
and
has
a
white
bonnet
on
,
and
is
amazing
.
Janet
*NL*
has
dressed
her
,
and
is
there
to
look
at
me
.
Peggotty
is
ready
to
go
to
*NL*
church
,
intending
to
behold
the
ceremony
from
the
gallery
.
Mr.
Dick
,
*NL*
who
is
to
give
my
darling
to
me
at
the
altar
,
has
had
his
hair
curled
.
*NL*
Traddles
,
whom
I
have
taken
up
by
appointment
at
the
turnpike
,
presents
*NL*
a
dazzling
combination
of
cream
color
and
light
blue
;
and
both
he
and
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
have
a
general
effect
about
them
of
being
all
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
I
see
this
,
because
I
know
it
is
so
;
but
I
am
astray
,
and
seem
*NL*
to
see
nothing
.
Nor
do
I
believe
anything
whatever
.
Still
,
as
we
drive
*NL*
along
in
an
open
carriage
,
this
fairy
marriage
is
real
enough
to
fill
me
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
wondering
pity
for
the
unfortunate
people
who
have
no
*NL*
part
in
it
,
but
are
sweeping
out
the
shops
,
and
going
to
their
daily
*NL*
occupations
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
sits
with
my
hand
in
hers
all
the
way
.
When
we
stop
a
little
way
*NL*
short
of
the
church
,
to
put
down
Peggotty
,
whom
we
have
brought
on
the
*NL*
box
,
she
gives
it
a
squeeze
,
and
me
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
Trot
!
My
own
boy
never
could
be
dearer
.
I
think
of
poor
*NL*
dear
Baby
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I.
And
of
all
I
owe
to
you
,
dear
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
child
!
''
says
my
aunt
;
and
gives
her
hand
in
overflowing
cordiality
*NL*
to
Traddles
,
who
then
gives
his
to
Mr.
Dick
,
who
then
gives
his
to
me
,
*NL*
who
then
gives
mine
to
Traddles
,
and
then
we
come
to
the
church
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
is
calm
enough
,
I
am
sure
;
but
it
might
be
a
steam-power
loom
*NL*
in
full
action
,
for
any
sedative
effect
it
has
on
me
.
I
am
too
far
gone
*NL*
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
is
all
a
more
or
less
incoherent
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dream
of
their
coming
in
with
Dora
;
of
the
pew-opener
arranging
us
,
*NL*
like
a
drill-serjeant
,
before
the
altar
rails
;
of
my
wondering
,
even
*NL*
then
,
why
pew-openers
must
always
be
the
most
disagreeable
females
*NL*
procurable
,
and
whether
there
is
any
religious
dread
of
a
disastrous
*NL*
infection
of
good-humour
which
renders
it
indispensable
to
set
those
*NL*
vessels
of
vinegar
upon
the
road
to
Heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
clergyman
and
clerk
appearing
;
of
a
few
boatmen
and
some
other
*NL*
people
strolling
in
;
of
an
ancient
mariner
behind
me
,
strongly
flavoring
*NL*
the
church
with
rum
;
of
the
service
beginning
in
a
deep
voice
,
and
our
*NL*
all
being
very
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Miss
Lavinia
,
who
acts
as
a
semi-auxiliary
bridesmaid
,
being
the
*NL*
first
to
cry
,
and
of
her
doing
homage
-LRB-
as
I
take
it
-RRB-
to
the
memory
of
*NL*
Pidger
,
in
sobs
;
of
Miss
Clarissa
applying
a
smelling-bottle
;
of
Agnes
*NL*
taking
care
of
Dora
;
of
my
aunt
endeavouring
to
represent
herself
as
a
*NL*
model
of
sternness
,
with
tears
rolling
down
her
face
;
of
little
Dora
*NL*
trembling
very
much
,
and
making
her
responses
in
faint
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
our
kneeling
down
together
,
side
by
side
;
of
Dora
's
trembling
less
*NL*
and
less
,
but
always
clasping
Agnes
by
the
hand
;
of
the
service
being
*NL*
got
through
,
quietly
and
gravely
;
of
our
all
looking
at
each
other
in
an
*NL*
April
state
of
smiles
and
tears
,
when
it
is
over
;
of
my
young
wife
being
*NL*
hysterical
in
the
vestry
,
and
crying
for
her
poor
papa
,
her
dear
papa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
her
soon
cheering
up
again
,
and
our
signing
the
register
all
round
.
*NL*
Of
my
going
into
the
gallery
for
Peggotty
to
bring
_
her
_
to
sign
it
;
of
*NL*
Peggotty
's
hugging
me
in
a
corner
,
and
telling
me
she
saw
my
own
dear
*NL*
mother
married
;
of
its
being
over
,
and
our
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
my
walking
so
proudly
and
lovingly
down
the
aisle
with
my
sweet
wife
*NL*
upon
my
arm
,
through
a
mist
of
half-seen
people
,
pulpits
,
monuments
,
*NL*
pews
,
fonts
,
organs
,
and
church
windows
,
in
which
there
flutter
faint
*NL*
airs
of
association
with
my
childish
church
at
home
,
so
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
I

Married
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Of
their
whispering
,
as
we
pass
,
what
a
youthful
couple
we
are
,
and
what
*NL*
a
pretty
little
wife
she
is
.
Of
our
all
being
so
merry
and
talkative
in
*NL*
the
carriage
going
back
.
Of
Sophy
telling
us
that
when
she
saw
Traddles
*NL*
-LRB-
whom
I
had
entrusted
with
the
licence
-RRB-
asked
for
it
,
she
almost
*NL*
fainted
,
having
been
convinced
that
he
would
contrive
to
lose
it
,
or
to
*NL*
have
his
pocket
picked
.
Of
Agnes
laughing
gaily
;
and
of
Dora
being
so
*NL*
fond
of
Agnes
that
she
will
not
be
separated
from
her
,
but
still
keeps
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
there
being
a
breakfast
,
with
abundance
of
things
,
pretty
and
*NL*
substantial
,
to
eat
and
drink
,
whereof
I
partake
,
as
I
should
do
in
any
*NL*
other
dream
,
without
the
least
perception
of
their
flavor
;
eating
and
*NL*
drinking
,
as
I
may
say
,
nothing
but
love
and
marriage
,
and
no
more
*NL*
believing
in
the
viands
than
in
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
my
making
a
speech
in
the
same
dreamy
fashion
,
without
having
an
idea
*NL*
of
what
I
want
to
say
,
beyond
such
as
may
be
comprehended
in
the
full
*NL*
conviction
that
I
have
n't
said
it
.
Of
our
being
very
sociably
and
simply
*NL*
happy
-LRB-
always
in
a
dream
though
-RRB-
;
and
of
Jip
's
having
wedding
cake
,
and
*NL*
its
not
agreeing
with
him
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
pair
of
hired
post-horses
being
ready
,
and
of
Dora
's
going
away
*NL*
to
change
her
dress
.
Of
my
aunt
and
Miss
Clarissa
remaining
with
us
;
and
*NL*
our
walking
in
the
garden
;
and
my
aunt
,
who
has
made
quite
a
speech
at
*NL*
breakfast
touching
Dora
's
aunts
,
being
mightily
amused
with
herself
,
but
*NL*
a
little
proud
of
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Dora
's
being
ready
,
and
of
Miss
Lavinia
's
hovering
about
her
,
loth
to
*NL*
lose
the
pretty
toy
that
has
given
her
so
much
pleasant
occupation
.
Of
*NL*
Dora
's
making
a
long
series
of
surprised
discoveries
that
she
has
*NL*
forgotten
all
sorts
of
little
things
;
and
of
everybody
's
running
*NL*
everywhere
to
fetch
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
their
all
closing
about
Dora
,
when
at
last
she
begins
to
say
*NL*
good-bye
,
looking
,
with
their
bright
colors
and
ribbons
,
like
a
bed
of
*NL*
flowers
.
Of
my
darling
being
almost
smothered
among
the
flowers
,
and
*NL*
coming
out
,
laughing
and
crying
both
together
,
to
my
jealous
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
my
wanting
to
carry
Jip
-LRB-
who
is
to
go
along
with
us
-RRB-
,
and
Dora
's
*NL*
saying
no
,
that
she
must
carry
him
,
or
else
he
'll
think
she
do
n't
like
*NL*
him
any
more
,
now
she
is
married
,
and
will
break
his
heart
.
Of
our
*NL*
going
,
arm
in
arm
,
and
Dora
stopping
and
looking
back
,
and
saying
,
``
If
I
*NL*
have
ever
been
cross
or
ungrateful
to
anybody
,
do
n't
remember
it
!
''
and
*NL*
bursting
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
her
waving
her
little
hand
,
and
our
going
away
once
more
.
Of
her
once
*NL*
more
stopping
,
and
looking
back
,
and
hurrying
to
Agnes
,
and
giving
*NL*
Agnes
,
above
all
the
others
,
her
last
kisses
and
farewells
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
drive
away
together
,
and
I
awake
from
the
dream
.
I
believe
it
at
*NL*
last
.
It
is
my
dear
,
dear
,
little
wife
beside
me
,
whom
I
love
so
well
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
happy
now

you

says
Dora

``
and
sure
you
do
n't
*NL*
repent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
have
stood
aside
to
see
the
phantoms
of
those
days
go
by
me
.
They
are
*NL*
gone
,
and
I
resume
the
journey
of

CHAPTER
XLIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
OUR
HOUSEKEEPING
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
strange
condition
of
things
,
the
honey-moon
being
over
,
and
the
*NL*
bridesmaids
gone
home
,
when
I
found
myself
sitting
down
in
my
own
small
*NL*
house
with
Dora
;
quite
thrown
out
of
employment
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
*NL*
respect
of
the
delicious
old
occupation
of
making
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
such
an
extraordinary
thing
to
have
Dora
always
there
.
It
was
*NL*
so
unaccountable
not
to
be
obliged
to
go
out
to
see
her
,
not
to
have
any
*NL*
occasion
to
be
tormenting
myself
about
her
,
not
to
have
to
write
to
her
,
*NL*
not
to
be
scheming
and
devising
opportunities
of
being
alone
with
her
.
*NL*
Sometimes
of
an
evening
,
when
I
looked
up
from
my
writing
,
and
saw
her
*NL*
seated
opposite
,
I
would
lean
back
in
my
chair
,
and
think
how
queer
it
*NL*
was
that
there
we
were
,
alone
together
as
a
matter
of
course
--
nobody
's
*NL*
business
any
more
--
all
the
romance
of
our
engagement
put
away
upon
a
*NL*
shelf
,
to
rust
--
no
one
to
please
but
one
another
--
one
another
to
please
,
*NL*
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
there
was
a
debate
,
and
I
was
kept
out
very
late
,
it
seemed
so
*NL*
strange
to
me
,
as
I
was
walking
home
,
to
think
that
Dora
was
at
home
!
It
*NL*
was
such
a
wonderful
thing
,
at
first
,
to
have
her
coming
softly
down
to
*NL*
talk
to
me
as
I
ate
my
supper
.
It
was
such
a
stupendous
thing
to
know
*NL*
for
certain
that
she
put
her
hair
in
papers
.
It
was
altogether
such
an
*NL*
astonishing
event
to
see
her
do
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
whether
two
young
birds
could
have
known
less
about
keeping
*NL*
house
,
than
I
and
my
pretty
Dora
did
.
We
had
a
servant
,
of
course
.
She
*NL*
kept
house
for
us
.
I
have
still
a
latent
belief
that
she
must
have
been
*NL*
Mrs.
Crupp
's
daughter
in
disguise
,
we
had
such
an
awful
time
of
it
with
*NL*
Mary
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
name
was
Paragon
.
Her
nature
was
represented
to
us
,
when
we
engaged
*NL*
her
,
as
being
feebly
expressed
in
her
name
.
She
had
a
written
character
,
*NL*
as
large
as
a
proclamation
;
and
,
according
to
this
document
,
could
do
*NL*
everything
of
a
domestic
nature
that
ever
I
heard
of
,
and
a
great
many
*NL*
things
that
I
never
did
hear
of
.
She
was
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
;
*NL*
of
a
severe
countenance
;
and
subject
-LRB-
particularly
in
the
arms
-RRB-
to
a
*NL*
sort
of
perpetual
measles
or
fiery
rash
.
She
had
a
cousin
in
the
Life
*NL*
Guards
,
with
such
long
legs
that
he
looked
like
the
afternoon
shadow
of
*NL*
somebody
else
.
His
shell-jacket
was
as
much
too
little
for
him
as
he
was
*NL*
too
big
for
the
premises
.
He
made
the
cottage
smaller
than
it
need
have
*NL*
been
,
by
being
so
very
much
out
of
proportion
to
it
.
Besides
which
,
the
*NL*
walls
were
not
thick
,
and
whenever
he
passed
the
evening
at
our
house
,
*NL*
we
always
knew
of
it
by
hearing
one
continual
growl
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
treasure
was
warranted
sober
and
honest
.
I
am
therefore
willing
to
*NL*
believe
that
she
was
in
a
fit
when
we
found
her
under
the
boiler
;
and
*NL*
that
the
deficient
teaspoons
were
attributable
to
the
dustman
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
preyed
upon
our
minds
dreadfully
.
We
felt
our
inexperience
,
and
*NL*
were
unable
to
help
ourselves
.
We
should
have
been
at
her
mercy
,
if
she
*NL*
had
had
any
;
but
she
was
a
remorseless
woman
,
and
had
none
.
She
was
the
*NL*
cause
of
our
first
little
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
life
,
''
I
said
one
day
to
Dora
,
``
do
you
think
Mary
Anne
has
*NL*
any
idea
of
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Doady
?
''
inquired
Dora
,
looking
up
,
innocently
,
from
her
drawing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
because
it
's
five
,
and
we
were
to
have
dined
at
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
glanced
wistfully
at
the
clock
,
and
hinted
that
she
thought
it
was
*NL*
too
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
my
love
,
''
said
I
,
referring
to
my
watch
,
``
it
's
a
few
*NL*
minutes
too
slow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
little
wife
came
and
sat
upon
my
knee
,
to
coax
me
to
be
quiet
,
and
*NL*
drew
a
line
with
her
pencil
down
the
middle
of
my
nose
;
but
I
could
n't
*NL*
dine
off
that
,
though
it
was
very
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
,
my
dear
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
*NL*
remonstrate
with
Mary
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
please
!
I
could
n't
,
Doady
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
my
love
?
''
I
gently
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
because
I
am
such
a
little
goose
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
and
she
knows
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
this
sentiment
so
incompatible
with
the
establishment
of
any
*NL*
system
of
check
on
Mary
Anne
,
that
I
frowned
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
ugly
wrinkles
in
my
bad
boy
's
forehead
!
''
said
Dora
,
and
still
*NL*
being
on
my
knee
,
she
traced
them
with
her
pencil
;
putting
it
to
her
*NL*
rosy
lips
to
make
it
mark
blacker
,
and
working
at
my
forehead
with
a
*NL*
quaint
little
mockery
of
being
industrious
,
that
quite
delighted
me
in
*NL*
spite
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
good
child
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
it
makes
its
face
so
much
prettier
*NL*
to
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
love
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
please
!
''
cried
Dora
,
with
a
kiss
,
``
do
n't
be
a
naughty
Blue
*NL*
Beard
!
Do
n't
be
serious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
precious
wife
,
''
said
I
,
``
we
must
be
serious
sometimes
.
Come
!
Sit
*NL*
down
on
this
chair
,
close
beside
me
!
Give
me
the
pencil
!
There
!
Now
let
*NL*
us
talk
sensibly
.
You
know
,
dear
;
''
what
a
little
hand
it
was
to
hold
,
*NL*
and
what
a
tiny
wedding-ring
it
was
to
see
!
``
You
know
,
my
love
,
it
is
*NL*
not
exactly
comfortable
to
have
to
go
out
without
one
's
dinner
.
Now
,
is
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
n
--
no
!
''
replied
Dora
,
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
how
you
tremble
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
KNOW
you
're
going
to
scold
me
,
''
exclaimed
Dora
,
in
a
piteous
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sweet
,
I
am
only
going
to
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
reasoning
is
worse
than
scolding
!
''
exclaimed
Dora
,
in
despair
.
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
marry
to
be
reasoned
with
.
If
you
meant
to
reason
with
such
a
*NL*
poor
little
thing
as
I
am
,
you
ought
to
have
told
me
so
,
you
cruel
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
pacify
Dora
,
but
she
turned
away
her
face
,
and
shook
her
*NL*
curls
from
side
to
side
,
and
said
``
You
cruel
,
cruel
boy
!
''
so
many
times
,
*NL*
that
I
really
did
not
exactly
know
what
to
do
:
so
I
took
a
few
turns
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
in
my
uncertainty
,
and
came
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dora
,
my
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
your
darling
.
Because
you
_
must
_
be
sorry
that
you
married
*NL*
me
,
or
else
you
would
n't
reason
with
me
!
''
returned
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
so
injured
by
the
inconsequential
nature
of
this
charge
,
that
it
*NL*
gave
me
courage
to
be
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
own
Dora
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
are
very
childish
,
and
are
talking
*NL*
nonsense
.
You
must
remember
,
I
am
sure
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
go
out
*NL*
yesterday
when
dinner
was
half
over
;
and
that
,
the
day
before
,
I
was
*NL*
made
quite
unwell
by
being
obliged
to
eat
underdone
veal
in
a
hurry
;
*NL*
to-day
,
I
do
n't
dine
at
all
--
and
I
am
afraid
to
say
how
long
we
waited
*NL*
for
breakfast
--
and
_
then
_
the
water
did
n't
boil
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
*NL*
reproach
you
,
my
dear
,
but
this
is
not
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
cruel
,
cruel
boy
,
to
say
I
am
a
disagreeable
wife
!
''
cried
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
Dora
,
you
must
know
that
I
never
said
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
I
was
n't
comfortable
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
the
housekeeping
was
not
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
exactly
the
same
thing
!
''
cried
Dora
.
And
she
evidently
thought
so
,
*NL*
for
she
wept
most
grievously
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
another
turn
across
the
room
,
full
of
love
for
my
pretty
wife
,
*NL*
and
distracted
by
self-accusatory
inclinations
to
knock
my
head
against
*NL*
the
door
.
I
sat
down
again
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
blaming
you
,
Dora
.
We
have
both
a
great
deal
to
learn
.
I
am
*NL*
only
trying
to
show
you
,
my
dear
,
that
you
must
--
you
really
must
''
-LRB-
I
was
*NL*
resolved
not
to
give
this
up
-RRB-
--
``
accustom
yourself
to
look
after
Mary
*NL*
Anne
.
Likewise
to
act
a
little
for
yourself
,
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
I
do
,
at
your
making
such
ungrateful
speeches
,
''
sobbed
Dora
.
*NL*
``
When
you
know
that
the
other
day
,
when
you
said
you
would
like
a
little
*NL*
bit
of
fish
,
I
went
out
myself
,
miles
and
miles
,
and
ordered
it
,
to
*NL*
surprise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
was
very
kind
of
you
,
my
own
darling
,
''
said
I.
``
I
felt
it
*NL*
so
much
that
I
would
n't
on
any
account
have
even
mentioned
that
you
*NL*
bought
a
Salmon
--
which
was
too
much
for
two
.
Or
that
it
cost
one
pound
*NL*
six
--
which
was
more
than
we
can
afford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
enjoyed
it
very
much
,
''
sobbed
Dora
.
``
And
you
said
I
was
a
Mouse

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
say
so
again
,
my
love

''
I
returned
,
``
a
thousand
times
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
wounded
Dora
's
soft
little
heart
,
and
she
was
not
to
be
*NL*
comforted
.
She
was
so
pathetic
in
her
sobbing
and
bewailing
,
that
I
felt
*NL*
as
if
I
had
said
I
do
n't
know
what
to
hurt
her
.
I
was
obliged
to
hurry
*NL*
away
;
I
was
kept
out
late
;
and
I
felt
all
night
such
pangs
of
remorse
as
*NL*
made
me
miserable
.
I
had
the
conscience
of
an
assassin
,
and
was
haunted
*NL*
by
a
vague
sense
of
enormous
wickedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
two
or
three
hours
past
midnight
when
I
got
home
.
I
found
my
*NL*
aunt
,
in
our
house
,
sitting
up
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anything
the
matter
,
aunt
?
''
said
I
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
Trot
,
''
she
replied
.
``
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
Little
Blossom
has
*NL*
been
rather
out
of
spirits
,
and
I
have
been
keeping
her
company
.
That
's
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
leaned
my
head
upon
my
hand
;
and
felt
more
sorry
and
downcast
,
as
I
*NL*
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
than
I
could
have
supposed
possible
so
soon
*NL*
after
the
fulfilment
of
my
brightest
hopes
.
As
I
sat
thinking
,
I
*NL*
happened
to
meet
my
aunt
's
eyes
,
which
were
resting
on
my
face
.
There
*NL*
was
an
anxious
expression
in
them
,
but
it
cleared
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
aunt
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
have
been
quite
unhappy
myself
all
*NL*
night

to
think
of
Dora
's
being
so

But
I
had
no
other
intention
than
to
*NL*
speak
to
her
tenderly
and
lovingly
about
our
home-affairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
nodded
encouragement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
patience

Trot

said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

Heaven
knows
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
unreasonable

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

said
my
aunt
.
``
But
Little
Blossom
is
a
very
tender
little
*NL*
blossom
,
and
the
wind
must
be
gentle
with
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
my
good
aunt
,
in
my
heart
,
for
her
tenderness
towards
my
wife
;
*NL*
and
I
was
sure
that
she
knew
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
,
aunt
,
''
said
I
,
after
some
further
contemplation
of
the
*NL*
fire
,
``
that
you
could
advise
and
counsel
Dora
a
little
,
for
our
mutual
*NL*
advantage
,
now
and
then
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
with
some
emotion
,
``
no
!
Do
n't
ask
me
such
a
*NL*
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
was
so
very
earnest
that
I
raised
my
eyes
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
look
back
on
my
life
,
child
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
I
think
of
some
who
*NL*
are
in
their
graves
,
with
whom
I
might
have
been
on
kinder
terms
.
If
I
*NL*
judged
harshly
of
other
people
's
mistakes
in
marriage
,
it
may
have
been
*NL*
because
I
had
bitter
reason
to
judge
harshly
of
my

Let
that
pass

I
*NL*
have
been
a
grumpy

frumpy

wayward
sort
of
a
woman
,
a
good
many
years
.
*NL*
I
am
still
,
and
I
always
shall
be
.
But
you
and
I
have
done
one
another
*NL*
some
good
,
Trot
,
--
at
all
events
,
you
have
done
me
good
,
my
dear
;
and
*NL*
division
must
not
come
between
us
,
at
this
time
of
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Division
between
_
us
_
!
''
cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
,
child
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
smoothing
her
dress
,
``
how
soon
it
might
*NL*
come
between
us
,
or
how
unhappy
I
might
make
our
Little
Blossom
,
if
I
*NL*
meddled
in
anything
,
a
prophet
could
n't
say
.
I
want
our
pet
to
like
me
,
*NL*
and
be
as
gay
as
a
butterfly
.
Remember
your
own
home
,
in
that
second
*NL*
marriage
;
and
never
do
both
me
and
her
the
injury
you
have
hinted
at
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
comprehended
,
at
once
,
that
my
aunt
was
right
;
and
I
comprehended
the
*NL*
full
extent
of
her
generous
feeling
towards
my
dear
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
early
days
,
Trot
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
and
Rome
was
not
built
in
a
*NL*
day
,
nor
in
a
year
.
You
have
chosen
freely
for
yourself
;
''
a
cloud
passed
*NL*
over
her
face
for
a
moment
,
I
thought
;
``
and
you
have
chosen
a
very
*NL*
pretty
and
a
very
affectionate
creature
.
It
will
be
your
duty
,
and
it
*NL*
will
be
your
pleasure
too
--
of
course
I
know
that
;
I
am
not
delivering
a
*NL*
lecture
--
to
estimate
her
-LRB-
as
you
chose
her
-RRB-
by
the
qualities
she
has
,
*NL*
and
not
by
the
qualities
she
may
not
have
.
The
latter
you
must
develop
*NL*
in
her
,
if
you
can
.
And
if
you
can
not
,
child
,
''
here
my
aunt
rubbed
her
*NL*
nose
,
``
you
must
just
accustom
yourself
to
do
without
'em
.
But
remember
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
your
future
is
between
you
two
.
No
one
can
assist
you
;
you
are
*NL*
to
work
it
out
for
yourselves
.
This
is
marriage
,
Trot
;
and
Heaven
bless
*NL*
you
both
,
in
it
,
for
a
pair
of
babes
in
the
wood
as
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
said
this
in
a
sprightly
way
,
and
gave
me
a
kiss
to
ratify
the
*NL*
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
she
,
``
light
my
little
lantern
,
and
see
me
into
my
band-box
*NL*
by
the
garden
path
;
''
for
there
was
a
communication
between
our
cottages
*NL*
in
that
direction
.
``
Give
Betsey
Trotwood
's
love
to
Blossom
,
when
you
*NL*
come
back
;
and
whatever
you
do
,
Trot
,
never
dream
of
setting
Betsey
up
*NL*
as
a
scarecrow
,
for
if
_
I
_
ever
saw
her
in
the
glass
,
she
's
quite
grim
*NL*
enough
and
gaunt
enough
in
her
private
capacity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
my
aunt
tied
her
head
up
in
a
handkerchief
,
with
which
she
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
make
a
bundle
of
it
on
such
occasions
;
and
I
escorted
her
*NL*
home
.
As
she
stood
in
her
garden
,
holding
up
her
little
lantern
to
light
*NL*
me
back
,
I
thought
her
observation
of
me
had
an
anxious
air
again
;
but
I
*NL*
was
too
much
occupied
in
pondering
on
what
she
had
said
,
and
too
much
*NL*
impressed
--
for
the
first
time
,
in
reality
--
by
the
conviction
that
Dora
*NL*
and
I
had
indeed
to
work
out
our
future
for
ourselves
,
and
that
no
one
*NL*
could
assist
us
,
to
take
much
notice
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
came
stealing
down
in
her
little
slippers
,
to
meet
me
,
now
that
I
*NL*
was
alone
;
and
cried
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
said
I
had
been
hard-hearted
*NL*
and
she
had
been
naughty
;
and
I
said
much
the
same
thing
in
effect
,
I
*NL*
believe
;
and
we
made
it
up
,
and
agreed
that
our
first
little
difference
*NL*
was
to
be
our
last
,
and
that
we
were
never
to
have
another
if
we
lived
a
*NL*
hundred
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
domestic
trial
we
went
through
,
was
the
Ordeal
of
Servants
.
*NL*
Mary
Anne
's
cousin
deserted
into
our
coal-hole
,
and
was
brought
out
,
*NL*
to
our
great
amazement
,
by
a
piquet
of
his
companions
in
arms
,
who
*NL*
took
him
away
handcuffed
in
a
procession
that
covered
our
front-garden
*NL*
with
ignominy
.
This
nerved
me
to
get
rid
of
Mary
Anne
,
who
went
so
*NL*
mildly
,
on
receipt
of
wages
,
that
I
was
surprised
,
until
I
found
out
*NL*
about
the
tea-spoons
,
and
also
about
the
little
sums
she
had
borrowed
*NL*
in
my
name
of
the
tradespeople
without
authority
.
After
an
interval
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Kidgerbury
--
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
Kentish
Town
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
who
went
out
charing
,
but
was
too
feeble
to
execute
her
conceptions
of
*NL*
that
art
--
we
found
another
treasure
,
who
was
one
of
the
most
amiable
*NL*
of
women
,
but
who
generally
made
a
point
of
falling
either
up
or
down
*NL*
the
kitchen
stairs
with
the
tray
,
and
almost
always
plunged
into
the
*NL*
parlor
,
as
into
a
bath
,
with
the
tea-things
.
The
ravages
committed
by
*NL*
this
unfortunate
,
rendering
her
dismissal
necessary
,
she
was
succeeded
*NL*
-LRB-
with
intervals
of
Mrs.
Kidgerbury
-RRB-
by
a
long
line
of
Incapables
;
*NL*
terminating
in
a
young
person
of
genteel
appearance
,
who
went
to
*NL*
Greenwich
Fair
in
Dora
's
bonnet
.
After
whom
I
remember
nothing
but
an
*NL*
average
equality
of
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
we
had
anything
to
do
with
seemed
to
cheat
us
.
Our
appearance
*NL*
in
a
shop
was
a
signal
for
the
damaged
goods
to
be
brought
out
*NL*
immediately
.
If
we
bought
a
lobster
,
it
was
full
of
water
.
All
our
meat
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
tough
,
and
there
was
hardly
any
crust
to
our
loaves
.
In
*NL*
search
of
the
principle
on
which
joints
ought
to
be
roasted
,
to
be
*NL*
roasted
enough
,
and
not
too
much
,
I
myself
referred
to
the
Cookery
Book
,
*NL*
and
found
it
there
established
as
the
allowance
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
to
every
pound
,
and
say
a
quarter
over
.
But
the
principle
always
failed
*NL*
us
by
some
curious
fatality
,
and
we
never
could
hit
any
medium
between
*NL*
redness
and
cinders
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
reason
to
believe
that
in
accomplishing
these
failures
we
incurred
*NL*
a
far
greater
expense
than
if
we
had
achieved
a
series
of
triumphs
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
me
,
on
looking
over
the
tradesmen
's
books
,
as
if
we
might
*NL*
have
kept
the
basement
story
paved
with
butter
,
such
was
the
extensive
*NL*
scale
of
our
consumption
of
that
article
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
the
*NL*
Excise
returns
of
the
period
may
have
exhibited
any
increase
in
the
*NL*
demand
for
pepper
;
but
if
our
performances
did
not
affect
the
market
,
I
*NL*
should
say
several
families
must
have
left
off
using
it
.
And
the
most
*NL*
wonderful
fact
of
all
was
,
that
we
never
had
anything
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
washerwoman
pawning
the
clothes
,
and
coming
in
a
state
of
*NL*
penitent
intoxication
to
apologise
,
I
suppose
that
might
have
happened
*NL*
several
times
to
anybody
.
Also
the
chimney
on
fire
,
the
parish
engine
,
*NL*
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
the
Beadle
.
But
I
apprehend
that
we
were
*NL*
personally
unfortunate
in
engaging
a
servant
with
a
taste
for
cordials
,
*NL*
who
swelled
our
running
account
for
porter
at
the
public-house
by
such
*NL*
inexplicable
items
as
``
quartern
rum
shrub
-LRB-
Mrs.
C.
-RRB-
''
``
Half-quartern
gin
*NL*
and
cloves
-LRB-
Mrs.
C.
-RRB-
''
``
Glass
rum
and
peppermint
-LRB-
Mrs.
C.
-RRB-
''
--
the
*NL*
parenthesis
always
referring
to
Dora
,
who
was
supposed
,
it
appeared
on
*NL*
explanation
,
to
have
imbibed
the
whole
of
these
refreshments
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
our
first
feats
in
the
housekeeping
way
was
a
little
dinner
to
*NL*
Traddles
.
I
met
him
in
town
,
and
asked
him
to
walk
out
with
me
that
*NL*
afternoon
.
He
readily
consenting
,
I
wrote
to
Dora
,
saying
I
would
bring
*NL*
him
home
.
It
was
pleasant
weather
,
and
on
the
road
we
made
my
domestic
*NL*
happiness
the
theme
of
conversation
.
Traddles
was
very
full
of
it
;
and
*NL*
said
,
that
,
picturing
himself
with
such
a
home
,
and
Sophy
waiting
and
*NL*
preparing
for
him
,
he
could
think
of
nothing
wanting
to
complete
his
*NL*
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
have
wished
for
a
prettier
little
wife
at
the
opposite
end
*NL*
of
the
table
,
but
I
certainly
could
have
wished
,
when
we
sate
down
,
for
*NL*
a
little
more
room
.
I
did
not
know
how
it
was
,
but
though
there
were
*NL*
only
two
of
us
,
we
were
at
once
always
cramped
for
room
,
and
yet
had
*NL*
always
room
enough
to
lose
everything
in
.
I
suspect
it
may
have
been
*NL*
because
nothing
had
a
place
of
its
own
,
except
Jip
's
pagoda
,
which
*NL*
invariably
blocked
up
the
main
thoroughfare
.
On
the
present
occasion
,
*NL*
Traddles
was
so
hemmed
in
by
the
pagoda
and
the
guitar-case
,
and
Dora
's
*NL*
flower-painting
,
and
my
writing-table
,
that
I
had
serious
doubts
of
the
*NL*
possibility
of
his
using
his
knife
and
fork
;
but
he
protested
,
with
his
*NL*
own
good-humour
,
``
Oceans
of
room
,
Copperfield
!
I
assure
you
,
Oceans
!
''

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
thing
I
could
have
wished
,
namely
,
that
Jip
had
never
*NL*
been
encouraged
to
walk
about
the
table-cloth
during
dinner
.
I
began
to
*NL*
think
there
was
something
disorderly
in
his
being
there
at
all
,
even
if
*NL*
he
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
putting
his
foot
in
the
salt
or
the
*NL*
melted
butter
.
On
this
occasion
he
seemed
to
think
he
was
introduced
*NL*
expressly
to
keep
Traddles
at
bay
;
and
he
barked
at
my
old
friend
,
and
*NL*
made
short
runs
at
his
plate
,
with
such
undaunted
pertinacity
,
that
he
*NL*
may
be
said
to
have
engrossed
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
I
knew
how
tender-hearted
my
dear
Dora
was
,
and
how
*NL*
sensitive
she
would
be
to
any
slight
upon
her
favorite
,
I
hinted
no
*NL*
objection
.
For
similar
reasons
I
made
no
allusion
to
the
skirmishing
*NL*
plates
upon
the
floor
;
or
to
the
disreputable
appearance
of
the
castors
,
*NL*
which
were
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
,
and
looked
drunk
;
or
to
the
further
*NL*
blockade
of
Traddles
by
wandering
vegetable
dishes
and
jugs
.
I
could
not
*NL*
help
wondering
in
my
own
mind
,
as
I
contemplated
the
boiled
leg
of
*NL*
mutton
before
me
,
previous
to
carving
it
,
how
it
came
to
pass
that
our
*NL*
joints
of
meat
were
of
such
extraordinary
shapes
--
and
whether
our
*NL*
butcher
contracted
for
all
the
deformed
sheep
that
came
into
the
world
;
*NL*
but
I
kept
my
reflections
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
I
to
Dora
,
``
what
have
you
got
in
that
dish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
imagine
why
Dora
had
been
making
tempting
little
faces
at
*NL*
me
,
as
if
she
wanted
to
kiss
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oysters
,
dear
,
''
said
Dora
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
_
your
_
thought
?
''
said
I
,
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-yes
,
Doady
,
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
was
a
happier
one
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
laying
down
the
*NL*
carving-knife
and
fork
.
``
There
is
nothing
Traddles
likes
so
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-yes
,
Doady
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
and
so
I
bought
a
beautiful
little
barrel
*NL*
of
them
,
and
the
man
said
they
were
very
good
.
But
I
--
I
am
afraid
*NL*
there
's
something
the
matter
with
them
.
They
do
n't
seem
right
.
''
Here
*NL*
Dora
shook
her
head
,
and
diamonds
twinkled
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
only
opened
in
both
shells
,
''
said
I.
``
Take
the
top
one
off
,
my
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
wo
n't
come
off
,
''
said
Dora
,
trying
very
hard
,
and
looking
very
*NL*
much
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Copperfield
,
''
said
Traddles
,
cheerfully
examining
the
*NL*
dish
,
``
I
think
it
is
in
consequence
--
they
are
capital
oysters
,
but
I
*NL*
_
think
_
it
is
in
consequence
--
of
their
never
having
been
opened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
never
had
been
opened
;
and
we
had
no
oyster-knives
--
and
could
n't
*NL*
have
used
them
if
we
had
;
so
we
looked
at
the
oysters
and
ate
the
*NL*
mutton
.
At
least
we
ate
as
much
of
it
as
was
done
,
and
made
up
with
*NL*
capers
.
If
I
had
permitted
him
,
I
am
satisfied
that
Traddles
would
have
*NL*
made
a
perfect
savage
of
himself
,
and
eaten
a
plateful
of
raw
meat
,
to
*NL*
express
enjoyment
of
the
repast
;
but
I
would
hear
of
no
such
immolation
*NL*
on
the
altar
of
friendship
,
and
we
had
a
course
of
bacon
instead
;
there
*NL*
happening
,
by
good
fortune
,
to
be
cold
bacon
in
the
larder
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
poor
little
wife
was
in
such
affliction
when
she
thought
I
should
be
*NL*
annoyed
,
and
in
such
a
state
of
joy
when
she
found
I
was
not
,
that
the
*NL*
discomfiture
I
had
subdued
,
very
soon
vanished
,
and
we
passed
a
happy
*NL*
evening
;
Dora
sitting
with
her
arm
on
my
chair
while
Traddles
and
I
*NL*
discussed
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
taking
every
opportunity
of
whispering
in
*NL*
my
ear
that
it
was
so
good
of
me
not
to
be
a
cruel
,
cross
old
boy
.
By
*NL*
and
bye
she
made
tea
for
us
;
which
it
was
so
pretty
to
see
her
do
,
as
if
*NL*
she
were
busying
herself
with
a
set
of
doll
's
tea-things
,
that
I
was
not
*NL*
particular
about
the
quality
of
the
beverage
.
Then
Traddles
and
I
played
*NL*
a
game
or
two
at
cribbage
;
and
Dora
singing
to
the
guitar
the
while
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
as
if
our
courtship
and
marriage
were
a
tender
dream
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
the
night
when
I
first
listened
to
her
voice
were
not
yet
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Traddles
went
away
,
and
I
came
back
into
the
parlor
from
seeing
him
*NL*
out
,
my
wife
planted
her
chair
close
to
mine
,
and
sat
down
by
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
''
she
said
.
``
Will
you
try
to
teach
me
,
Doady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
teach
myself
first
,
Dora
,
''
said
I.
``
I
am
as
bad
as
you
,
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
But
you
can
learn
,
''
she
returned
;
``
and
you
are
a
clever
,
clever
*NL*
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
mouse
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
resumed
my
wife
,
after
a
long
silence
,
``
that
I
could
have
gone
*NL*
down
into
the
country
for
a
whole
year
,
and
lived
with
Agnes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hands
were
clasped
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
her
chin
rested
on
them
,
*NL*
and
her
blue
eyes
looked
quietly
into
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
might
have
improved
me
,
and
I
think
I
might
have
learnt
*NL*
from
_
her
_
,
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
in
good
time
,
my
love
.
Agnes
has
had
her
father
to
take
care
of
for
*NL*
these
many
years
,
you
should
remember
.
Even
when
she
was
quite
a
child
,
*NL*
she
was
the
Agnes
whom
we
know
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
call
me
a
name
I
want
you
to
call
me
?
''
inquired
Dora
,
without
*NL*
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
I
asked
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
stupid
name
,
''
she
said
,
shaking
her
curls
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
``
Child-wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughingly
asked
my
child-wife
what
her
fancy
was
in
desiring
to
be
so
*NL*
called
?
She
answered
without
moving
,
otherwise
than
as
the
arm
I
twined
*NL*
about
her
may
have
brought
her
blue
eyes
nearer
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
,
you
silly
fellow
,
that
you
should
use
the
name
,
instead
*NL*
of
Dora
.
I
only
mean
that
you
should
think
of
me
that
way
.
When
you
are
*NL*
going
to
be
angry
with
me
,
say
to
yourself
,
`
it
's
only
my
child-wife
!
'
*NL*
When
I
am
very
disappointing
,
say
,
'
I
knew
,
a
long
time
ago
,
that
she
*NL*
would
make
but
a
child-wife
!
'
When
you
miss
what
I
should
like
to
be
,
*NL*
and
I
think
can
never
be
,
say
,
`
still
my
foolish
child-wife
loves
me
!
'
*NL*
For
indeed
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
serious
with
her
;
having
no
idea
,
until
now
,
that
she
was
*NL*
serious
herself
.
But
her
affectionate
nature
was
so
happy
in
what
I
now
*NL*
said
to
her
with
my
whole
heart
,
that
her
face
became
a
laughing
one
*NL*
before
her
glittering
eyes
were
dry
.
She
was
soon
my
child-wife
indeed
;
*NL*
sitting
down
on
the
floor
outside
the
Chinese
House
,
ringing
all
the
*NL*
little
bells
one
after
another
,
to
punish
Jip
for
his
recent
bad
*NL*
behaviour
;
while
Jip
lay
blinking
in
the
doorway
with
his
head
out
,
even
*NL*
too
lazy
to
be
teased
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeal
of
Dora
's
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
.
I
look
back
on
the
*NL*
time
I
write
of
;
I
invoke
the
innocent
figure
that
I
dearly
loved
,
to
*NL*
come
out
from
the
mists
and
shadows
of
the
past
,
and
turn
its
gentle
*NL*
head
towards
me
once
again
;
and
I
can
still
declare
that
this
one
little
*NL*
speech
was
constantly
in
my
memory
.
I
may
not
have
used
it
to
the
best
*NL*
account
;
I
was
young
and
inexperienced
;
but
I
never
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
*NL*
its
artless
pleading
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
told
me
,
shortly
afterwards
,
that
she
was
going
to
be
a
wonderful
*NL*
housekeeper
.
Accordingly
,
she
polished
the
tablets
,
pointed
the
pencil
,
*NL*
bought
an
immense
account-book
,
carefully
stitched
up
with
a
needle
and
*NL*
thread
all
the
leaves
of
the
Cookery-Book
which
Jip
had
torn
,
and
made
*NL*
quite
a
desperate
little
attempt
``
to
be
good
,
''
as
she
called
it
.
But
the
*NL*
figures
had
the
old
obstinate
propensity
--
they
_
would
not
_
add
up
.
When
*NL*
she
had
entered
two
or
three
laborious
items
in
the
account-book
,
Jip
*NL*
would
walk
over
the
page
,
wagging
his
tail
,
and
smear
them
all
out
.
Her
*NL*
own
little
right-hand
middle
finger
got
steeped
to
the
very
bone
in
ink
;
*NL*
and
I
think
that
was
the
only
decided
result
attained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
of
an
evening
,
when
I
was
at
home
and
at
work
--
for
I
wrote
*NL*
a
good
deal
now
,
and
was
beginning
in
a
small
way
to
be
known
as
a
*NL*
writer
--
I
would
lay
down
my
pen
,
and
watch
my
child-wife
trying
to
be
*NL*
good
.
First
of
all
,
she
would
bring
out
the
immense
account-book
,
and
*NL*
lay
it
down
upon
the
table
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
Then
she
would
open
it
*NL*
at
the
place
where
Jip
had
made
it
illegible
last
night
,
and
call
Jip
*NL*
up
,
to
look
at
his
misdeeds
.
This
would
occasion
a
diversion
in
Jip
's
*NL*
favour
,
and
some
inking
of
his
nose
,
perhaps
,
as
a
penalty
.
Then
she
*NL*
would
tell
Jip
to
lie
down
on
the
table
instantly
,
``
like
a
lion
''
--
which
*NL*
was
one
of
his
tricks
,
though
I
can
not
say
the
likeness
was
*NL*
striking
--
and
,
if
he
were
in
an
obedient
humor
,
he
would
obey
.
Then
she
*NL*
would
take
up
a
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
find
a
hair
in
it
.
Then
*NL*
she
would
take
up
another
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
find
that
it
*NL*
spluttered
.
Then
she
would
take
up
another
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
*NL*
say
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
talking
pen
,
and
will
disturb
Doady
!
''
*NL*
And
then
she
would
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
,
and
put
the
account-book
*NL*
away
,
after
pretending
to
crush
the
lion
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
,
if
she
were
in
a
very
sedate
and
serious
state
of
mind
,
she
would
*NL*
sit
down
with
the
tablets
,
and
a
little
basket
of
bills
and
other
*NL*
documents
,
which
looked
more
like
curl-papers
than
anything
else
,
and
*NL*
endeavour
to
get
some
result
out
of
them
.
After
severely
comparing
*NL*
one
with
another
,
and
making
entries
on
the
tablets
,
and
blotting
*NL*
them
out
,
and
counting
all
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
over
and
over
*NL*
again
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
she
would
be
so
vexed
and
discouraged
,
*NL*
and
would
look
so
unhappy
,
that
it
gave
me
pain
to
see
her
bright
face
*NL*
clouded
--
and
for
me
!
--
and
I
would
go
softly
to
her
,
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Dora
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
would
look
up
hopelessly
,
and
reply
,
``
They
wo
n't
come
right
.
They
*NL*
make
my
head
ache
so
.
And
they
wo
n't
do
anything
I
want
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
would
say
,
``
Now
let
us
try
together
.
Let
me
show
you
,
Dora
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
would
commence
a
practical
demonstration
,
to
which
Dora
would
pay
*NL*
profound
attention
,
perhaps
for
five
minutes
;
when
she
would
begin
to
be
*NL*
dreadfully
tired
,
and
would
lighten
the
subject
by
curling
my
hair
,
or
*NL*
trying
the
effect
of
my
face
with
my
shirt
collar
turned
down
.
If
I
*NL*
tacitly
checked
this
playfulness
,
and
persisted
,
she
would
look
so
*NL*
scared
and
disconsolate
,
as
she
became
more
and
more
bewildered
,
that
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
her
natural
gaiety
when
I
first
strayed
into
her
*NL*
path
,
and
of
her
being
my
child-wife
,
would
come
reproachfully
upon
me
;
*NL*
and
I
would
lay
the
pencil
down
,
and
call
for
the
guitar
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
,
and
had
many
anxieties
,
but
the
same
*NL*
considerations
made
me
keep
them
to
myself
.
I
am
far
from
sure
,
now
,
*NL*
that
it
was
right
to
do
this
,
but
I
did
it
for
my
child-wife
's
sake
.
I
*NL*
search
my
breast
,
and
I
commit
its
secrets
,
if
I
know
them
,
without
any
*NL*
reservation
to
this
paper
.
The
old
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
*NL*
had
,
I
am
conscious
,
some
place
in
my
heart
;
but
not
to
the
embitterment
*NL*
of
my
life
.
When
I
walked
alone
in
the
fine
weather
,
and
thought
of
the
*NL*
summer
days
when
all
the
air
had
been
filled
with
my
boyish
enchantment
,
*NL*
I
did
miss
something
of
the
realisation
of
my
dreams
;
but
I
thought
it
*NL*
was
a
softened
glory
of
the
Past
,
which
nothing
could
have
thrown
upon
*NL*
the
present
time
.
I
did
feel
,
sometimes
,
for
a
little
while
,
that
I
*NL*
could
have
wished
my
wife
had
been
my
counsellor
;
had
had
more
character
*NL*
and
purpose
,
to
sustain
me
and
improve
me
by
;
had
been
endowed
with
*NL*
power
to
fill
up
the
void
which
somewhere
seemed
to
be
about
me
;
but
I
*NL*
felt
as
if
this
were
an
unearthly
consummation
of
my
happiness
,
that
*NL*
never
had
been
meant
to
be
,
and
never
could
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
boyish
husband
as
to
years
.
I
had
known
the
softening
influence
*NL*
of
no
other
sorrows
or
experiences
than
those
recorded
in
these
leaves
.
*NL*
If
I
did
any
wrong
,
as
I
may
have
done
much
,
I
did
it
in
mistaken
love
,
*NL*
and
in
my
want
of
wisdom
.
I
write
the
exact
truth
.
It
would
avail
me
*NL*
nothing
to
extenuate
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
was
that
I
took
upon
myself
the
toils
and
cares
of
our
life
,
and
*NL*
had
no
partner
in
them
.
We
lived
much
as
before
,
in
reference
to
our
*NL*
scrambling
household
arrangements
;
but
I
had
got
used
to
those
,
and
Dora
*NL*
I
was
pleased
to
see
was
seldom
vexed
now
.
She
was
bright
and
cheerful
*NL*
in
the
old
childish
way
,
loved
me
dearly
,
and
was
happy
with
her
old
*NL*
trifles
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
debates
were
heavy
--
I
mean
as
to
length
,
not
quality
,
for
in
*NL*
the
last
respect
they
were
not
often
otherwise
--
and
I
went
home
late
,
*NL*
Dora
would
never
rest
when
she
heard
my
footsteps
,
but
would
always
come
*NL*
down
stairs
to
meet
me
.
When
my
evenings
were
unoccupied
by
the
pursuit
*NL*
for
which
I
had
qualified
myself
with
so
much
pains
,
and
I
was
engaged
*NL*
in
writing
at
home
,
she
would
sit
quietly
near
me
,
however
late
the
*NL*
hour
,
and
be
so
mute
,
that
I
would
often
think
she
had
dropped
asleep
.
*NL*
But
generally
,
when
I
raised
my
head
,
I
saw
her
blue
eyes
looking
at
me
*NL*
with
the
quiet
attention
of
which
I
have
already
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
weary
boy
!
''
said
Dora
one
night
,
when
I
met
her
eyes
as
I
*NL*
was
shutting
up
my
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
weary
girl
!
''
said
I.
``
That
's
more
to
the
purpose
.
You
must
go
to
*NL*
bed
another
time
,
my
love
.
It
's
far
too
late
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
send
me
to
bed
!
''
pleaded
Dora
,
coming
to
my
side
.
``
Pray
do
n't
*NL*
do
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dora
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
amazement
she
was
sobbing
on
my
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
well
,
my
dear
!
not
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
quite
well
,
and
very
happy
!
''
said
Dora
.
``
But
say
you
'll
let
me
*NL*
stop
,
and
see
you
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
sight
for
such
bright
eyes
at
midnight
!
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
bright
,
though
?
''
returned
Dora
,
laughing
.
``
I
'm
so
glad
they
're
*NL*
bright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Vanity
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
vanity
;
it
was
only
harmless
delight
in
my
admiration
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
very
well
,
before
she
told
me
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
them
pretty
,
say
I
may
always
stop
,
and
see
you
write
!
''
*NL*
said
Dora
.
''
_
Do
_
you
think
them
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
me
always
stop
and
see
you
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
that
wo
n't
improve
their
brightness

*NL*
``
Yes
it
will
!
Because
,
you
clever
boy
,
you
'll
not
forget
me
then
,
while
*NL*
you
are
full
of
silent
fancies
.
Will
you
mind
it
,
if
I
say
something
*NL*
very
,
very
silly
?
--
more
than
usual
?
''
inquired
Dora
,
peeping
over
my
*NL*
shoulder
into
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wonderful
thing
is
that
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
let
me
hold
the
pens
,
''
said
Dora
.
``
I
want
to
have
something
to
*NL*
do
with
all
those
many
hours
when
you
are
so
industrious
.
May
I
hold
the
*NL*
pens
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remembrance
of
her
pretty
joy
when
I
said
yes
,
brings
tears
into
my
*NL*
eyes
.
The
next
time
I
sat
down
to
write
,
and
regularly
afterwards
,
she
*NL*
sat
in
her
old
place
with
a
spare
bundle
of
pens
at
her
side
.
Her
*NL*
triumph
in
this
connexion
with
my
work
,
and
her
delight
when
I
wanted
a
*NL*
new
pen
--
which
I
very
often
feigned
to
do
--
suggested
to
me
a
new
way
of
*NL*
pleasing
my
child-wife
.
I
occasionally
made
a
pretence
of
wanting
a
page
*NL*
or
two
of
manuscript
copied
.
Then
Dora
was
in
her
glory
.
The
*NL*
preparations
she
made
for
this
great
work
,
the
aprons
she
put
on
,
the
*NL*
bibs
she
borrowed
from
the
kitchen
to
keep
off
the
ink
,
the
time
she
*NL*
took
,
the
innumerable
stoppages
she
made
to
have
a
laugh
with
Jip
as
if
*NL*
he
understood
it
all
,
her
conviction
that
her
work
was
incomplete
unless
*NL*
she
signed
her
name
at
the
end
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
would
bring
it
*NL*
to
me
,
like
a
school-copy
,
and
then
,
when
I
praised
it
,
clasp
me
round
*NL*
the
neck
,
are
touching
recollections
to
me
,
simple
as
they
might
appear
*NL*
to
other
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
possession
of
the
keys
soon
after
this
,
and
went
jingling
about
*NL*
the
house
with
the
whole
bunch
in
a
little
basket
,
tied
to
her
slender
*NL*
waist
.
I
seldom
found
that
the
places
to
which
they
belonged
were
*NL*
locked
,
or
that
they
were
of
any
use
except
as
a
plaything
for
Jip
--
but
*NL*
Dora
was
pleased
,
and
that
pleased
me
.
She
was
quite
satisfied
that
a
*NL*
good
deal
was
effected
by
this
make-belief
of
housekeeping
;
and
was
as
*NL*
merry
as
if
we
had
been
keeping
a
baby-house
,
for
a
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
went
on
.
Dora
was
hardly
less
affectionate
to
my
aunt
than
to
me
,
*NL*
and
often
told
her
of
the
time
when
she
was
afraid
she
was
``
a
cross
old
*NL*
thing
.
''
I
never
saw
my
aunt
unbend
more
systematically
to
anyone
.
She
*NL*
courted
Jip
,
though
Jip
never
responded
;
listened
,
day
after
day
,
to
the
*NL*
guitar
,
though
I
am
afraid
she
had
no
taste
for
music
;
never
attacked
*NL*
the
Incapables
,
though
the
temptation
must
have
been
severe
;
went
*NL*
wonderful
distances
on
foot
to
purchase
,
as
surprises
,
any
trifles
that
*NL*
she
found
out
Dora
wanted
;
and
never
came
in
by
the
garden
,
and
missed
*NL*
her
from
the
room
,
but
she
would
call
out
,
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
in
*NL*
a
voice
that
sounded
cheerfully
all
over
the
house
:

Little
Blossom

CHAPTER
XLV
.
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
DICK
FULFILS
MY
AUNT
'S
PREDICTION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
now
,
since
I
had
left
the
Doctor
.
Living
in
his
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
I
saw
him
frequently
;
and
we
all
went
to
his
house
on
two
*NL*
or
three
occasions
to
dinner
or
tea
.
The
Old
Soldier
was
in
permanent
*NL*
quarters
under
the
Doctor
's
roof
.
She
was
exactly
the
same
as
ever
,
and
*NL*
the
same
immortal
butterflies
hovered
over
her
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
some
other
mothers
,
whom
I
have
known
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Markleham
was
far
more
fond
of
pleasure
than
her
daughter
was
.
She
*NL*
required
a
great
deal
of
amusement
,
and
,
like
a
deep
old
soldier
,
*NL*
pretended
,
in
consulting
her
own
inclinations
,
to
be
devoting
herself
to
*NL*
her
child
.
The
Doctor
's
desire
that
Annie
should
be
entertained
,
was
*NL*
therefore
particularly
acceptable
to
this
excellent
parent
;
who
*NL*
expressed
unqualified
approval
of
his
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
doubt
,
indeed
,
that
she
probed
the
Doctor
's
wound
without
*NL*
knowing
it
.
Meaning
nothing
but
a
certain
matured
frivolity
and
*NL*
selfishness
,
not
always
inseparable
from
full-blown
years
,
I
think
she
*NL*
confirmed
him
in
his
fear
that
he
was
a
constraint
upon
his
young
wife
,
*NL*
and
that
there
was
no
congeniality
of
feeling
between
them
,
by
so
*NL*
strongly
commending
his
design
of
lightening
the
load
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
soul
,
''
she
said
to
him
one
day
when
I
was
present
,
``
you
know
*NL*
there
is
no
doubt
it
would
be
a
little
pokey
for
Annie
to
be
always
shut
*NL*
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
nodded
his
benevolent
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
comes
to
her
mother
's
age
,
''
said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
with
a
*NL*
flourish
of
her
fan
,
``
then
,
it
'll
be
another
thing
.
You
might
put
ME
*NL*
into
a
Jail
,
with
genteel
society
and
a
rubber
,
and
I
should
never
care
*NL*
to
come
out
.
But
I
am
not
Annie
,
you
know
;
and
Annie
is
not
her
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
surely
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
best
of
creatures
--
no
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
''
for
the
Doctor
*NL*
made
a
gesture
of
depreciation
,
``
I
must
say
before
your
face
,
as
I
*NL*
always
say
behind
your
back
,
you
are
the
best
of
creatures
;
but
of
*NL*
course
you
do
n't
--
now
do
you
?
--
enter
into
the
same
pursuits
and
fancies
*NL*
as
Annie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
in
a
sorrowful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
not
,
''
retorted
the
Old
Soldier
.
``
Take
your
Dictionary
*NL*
for
example
.
What
a
useful
work
a
Dictionary
is
!
What
a
necessary
work
!
*NL*
The
meanings
of
words
!
Without
Doctor
Johnson
,
or
somebody
of
that
*NL*
sort
,
we
might
have
been
at
this
present
moment
calling
an
Italian-iron
*NL*
a
bedstead
.
But
we
ca
n't
expect
a
Dictionary
--
especially
when
it
's
*NL*
making
--
to
interest
Annie
,
can
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
why
I
so
much
approve
,
''
said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
tapping
him
on
*NL*
the
shoulder
with
her
shut-up
fan
,
``
of
your
thoughtfulness
.
It
shows
*NL*
that
you
do
n't
expect
,
as
many
elderly
people
do
expect
,
old
heads
on
*NL*
young
shoulders
.
You
have
studied
Annie
's
character
,
and
you
understand
*NL*
it
.
_
That
's
_
what
I
find
so
charming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
calm
and
patient
face
of
Doctor
Strong
expressed
some
little
*NL*
sense
of
pain
,
I
thought
,
under
the
infliction
of
these
compliments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
''
said
the
Soldier
,
giving
him
several
*NL*
affectionate
taps
,
``
you
may
command
me
,
at
all
times
and
seasons
.
Now
,
*NL*
do
understand
that
I
am
entirely
at
your
service
.
I
am
ready
to
go
with
*NL*
Annie
to
operas
,
concerts
,
exhibitions
,
all
kinds
of
places
;
and
you
*NL*
shall
never
find
that
I
am
tired
.
Duty
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
before
every
*NL*
consideration
in
the
universe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
as
good
as
her
word
.
She
was
one
of
those
people
who
can
bear
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
and
she
never
flinched
in
her
perseverance
*NL*
in
the
cause
.
She
seldom
got
hold
of
the
newspaper
-LRB-
which
she
settled
*NL*
herself
down
in
the
softest
chair
in
the
house
to
read
through
an
*NL*
eye-glass
,
every
day
,
for
two
hours
-RRB-
,
but
she
found
out
something
that
*NL*
she
was
certain
Annie
would
like
to
see
.
It
was
in
vain
for
Annie
to
*NL*
protest
that
she
was
weary
of
such
things
.
Her
mother
's
remonstrance
*NL*
always
was
,
``
Now
,
my
dear
Annie
,
I
am
sure
you
know
better
;
and
I
must
*NL*
tell
you
,
my
love
,
that
you
are
not
making
a
proper
return
for
the
*NL*
kindness
of
Doctor
Strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
usually
said
in
the
Doctor
's
presence
,
and
appeared
to
me
to
*NL*
constitute
Annie
's
principal
inducement
for
withdrawing
her
objections
*NL*
when
she
made
any
.
But
in
general
she
resigned
herself
to
her
mother
,
*NL*
and
went
where
the
Old
Soldier
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
rarely
happened
now
that
Mr.
Maldon
accompanied
them
.
Sometimes
my
*NL*
aunt
and
Dora
were
invited
to
do
so
,
and
accepted
the
invitation
.
*NL*
Sometimes
Dora
only
was
asked
.
The
time
had
been
,
when
I
should
have
*NL*
been
uneasy
in
her
going
;
but
reflection
on
what
had
passed
that
former
*NL*
night
in
the
Doctor
's
study
,
had
made
a
change
in
my
mistrust
.
I
*NL*
believed
that
the
Doctor
was
right
,
and
I
had
no
worse
suspicions
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
rubbed
her
nose
sometimes
when
she
happened
to
be
alone
with
me
,
*NL*
and
said
she
could
n't
make
it
out
;
she
wished
they
were
happier
;
she
*NL*
did
n't
think
our
military
friend
-LRB-
so
she
always
called
the
Old
Soldier
-RRB-
*NL*
mended
the
matter
at
all
.
My
aunt
further
expressed
her
opinion
``
that
if
*NL*
our
military
friend
would
cut
off
those
butterflies
,
and
give
'em
to
the
*NL*
chimney-sweepers
for
May-day
,
it
would
look
like
the
beginning
of
*NL*
something
sensible
on
her
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
abiding
reliance
was
on
Mr.
Dick
.
That
man
had
evidently
an
idea
*NL*
in
his
head
,
she
said
;
and
if
he
could
only
once
pen
it
up
into
a
*NL*
corner
,
which
was
his
great
difficulty
,
he
would
distinguish
himself
in
*NL*
some
extraordinary
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unconscious
of
this
prediction
,
Mr.
Dick
continued
to
occupy
precisely
*NL*
the
same
ground
in
reference
to
the
Doctor
and
to
Mrs.
Strong
.
He
seemed
*NL*
neither
to
advance
nor
to
recede
.
He
appeared
to
have
settled
into
his
*NL*
original
foundation
,
like
a
building
;
and
I
must
confess
that
my
faith
*NL*
in
his
ever
moving
,
was
not
much
greater
than
if
he
had
been
a
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
night
,
when
I
had
been
married
some
months
,
Mr.
Dick
put
his
*NL*
head
into
the
parlor
,
where
I
was
writing
alone
-LRB-
Dora
having
gone
out
*NL*
with
my
aunt
to
take
tea
with
the
two
little
birds
-RRB-
,
and
said
,
with
a
*NL*
significant
cough
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
speak
to
me
without
inconveniencing
yourself
,
Trotwood
,
I
*NL*
am
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
Mr.
Dick
,
''
said
I
;
``
come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trotwood
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
laying
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
,
*NL*
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
me
.
``
Before
I
sit
down
,
I
wish
to
make
an
*NL*
observation
.
You
know
your
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
the
world
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
delivery
of
this
communication
,
which
he
shot
out
of
himself
*NL*
as
if
he
were
loaded
with
it
,
Mr.
Dick
sat
down
with
greater
gravity
*NL*
than
usual
,
and
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
boy
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
I
am
going
to
put
a
question
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
many
as
you
please
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
consider
me
,
sir
?
''
asked
Mr.
Dick
,
folding
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dear
old
friend
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Trotwood
,
''
returned
Mr.
Dick
,
laughing
,
and
reaching
across
*NL*
in
high
glee
to
shake
hands
with
me
.
``
But
I
mean
,
boy
,
''
resuming
his
*NL*
gravity
,
``
what
do
you
consider
me
in
this
respect
?
''
touching
his
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
puzzled
how
to
answer
,
but
he
helped
me
with
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weak
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
replied
,
dubiously
.
``
Rather
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
!
''
cried
Mr.
Dick
,
who
seemed
quite
enchanted
by
my
reply
.
``
That
*NL*
is

Trotwood
,
when
they
took
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
you-know-who
's
*NL*
head
,
and
put
it

know
where

there
was

''
Mr.
Dick
made
his
two
*NL*
hands
revolve
very
fast
about
each
other
a
great
number
of
times
,
and
*NL*
then
brought
them
into
collision
,
and
rolled
them
over
and
over
one
*NL*
another
,
to
express
confusion
.
``
There
was
that
sort
of
thing
done
to
me
*NL*
somehow
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
at
him
,
and
he
nodded
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
boy
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
,
``
I
am
*NL*
simple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
qualified
that
conclusion
,
but
he
stopped
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
!
She
pretends
I
am
not

She
wo
n't

of

I

know
I

If
she
had

stood
my

I
should
have
been
shut
*NL*
up
,
to
lead
a
dismal
life
these
many
years

But
I
'll
provide
for
her
!
I
*NL*
never
spend
the
copying
money
.
I
put
it
in
a
box

I
have
made
a
will

*NL*
I
'll
leave
it
all
to
her

She
shall
be
rich

noble

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
took
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
.
He
then
*NL*
folded
it
up
with
great
care
,
pressed
it
smooth
between
his
two
hands
,
*NL*
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
seemed
to
put
my
aunt
away
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
a
scholar

Trotwood

''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
You

is

*NL*
You
know

honor
he

always
done

proud
in

*NL*
Humble

humble
--
condescending
even
to
poor
Dick

who
is
simple
and
knows
*NL*
nothing

I
have
sent
his

up

on
a
scrap
of
paper

to
the
kite
,
*NL*
along
the
string
,
when
it
has
been
in
the
sky
,
among
the
larks
.
The
kite
*NL*
has
been
glad
to
receive
it
,
sir
,
and
the
sky
has
been
brighter
with
*NL*
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
delighted
him
by
saying
,
most
heartily
,
that
the
Doctor
was
deserving
*NL*
of
our
best
respect
and
highest
esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
his
beautiful

said
Mr.

``
A
shining
star

I
*NL*
have
seen
her
shine

,

bringing
his
chair
nearer
,
and
laying
*NL*
one
hand
upon
my
knee
--
``
clouds
,
sir

clouds

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
the
solicitude
which
his
face
expressed
,
by
conveying
the
*NL*
same
expression
into
my
own
,
and
shaking
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
clouds
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
wistfully
into
my
face
,
and
was
so
anxious
to
understand
,
*NL*
that
I
took
great
pains
to
answer
him
slowly
and
distinctly
,
as
I
might
*NL*
have
entered
on
an
explanation
to
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
unfortunate
division
between

I
replied
.
``
Some
*NL*
unhappy
cause

separation

A
secret

It
may
be
inseparable
from
the
*NL*
discrepancy

years

It
may
have
grown
up
out
of
almost
nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
,
who
told
off
every
sentence
with
a
thoughtful
nod
,
paused
when
*NL*
I
had
done
,
and
sat
considering
,
with
his
eyes
upon
my
face
,
and
his
*NL*
hand
upon
my
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
not
angry
with
her
,
Trotwood
?
''
he
said
,
after
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Devoted
to
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
I
have
got
it

said
Mr.
Dick
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
exultation
with
which
he
slapped
me
on
the
knee
,
and
leaned
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
,
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
up
as
high
as
he
could
*NL*
possibly
lift
them
,
made
me
think
him
farther
out
of
his
wits
than
*NL*
ever
.
He
became
as
suddenly
grave
again
,
and
leaning
forward
as
before
,
*NL*
said
--
first
respectfully
taking
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
as
if
it
*NL*
really
did
represent
my
aunt
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
wonderful
woman
in
the
world

Why
has
_
she

done
nothing
*NL*
to

right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
delicate
and
difficult
a
subject

such
interference

I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
scholar

''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
touching
me
with
his
finger
.
``
Why
has
*NL*
_
he
_
done
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the

reason

''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
I
have
got
it
,
boy
!
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
And
he
stood
up
before
me
,
*NL*
more
exultingly
than
before
,
nodding
his
head
,
and
striking
himself
*NL*
repeatedly
upon
the
breast
,
until
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
*NL*
nearly
nodded
and
struck
all
the
breath
out
of
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
poor
fellow
with
a
craze
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
a
simpleton
,
a
*NL*
weak-minded
person
--
present
company
,

know

''
striking
himself
again
,
*NL*
``

do

And
*NL*
who

Whoo

He
blew
a
slight
,
contemptuous
*NL*
breath
,
as
if
he
blew
himself
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fortunate
he
had
proceeded
so
far
with
his
mystery
,
for
we
heard
*NL*
the
coach
stop
at
the
little
garden
gate
,
which
brought
my
aunt
and
Dora
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
,

!
''
he
pursued
in
a
whisper
;
``
leave
all
the
blame
with
*NL*
Dick

simple
Dick

mad

I
have
been
thinking
,

for
some
time
*NL*
that
I
was
getting
it
,
and
now
I
have
got
it
.
After
what
you
have
said
*NL*
to
me
,
I
am
sure
I
have
got
it
.
All
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
another
word
did
Mr.
Dick
utter
on
the
subject
;
but
he
made
a
very
*NL*
telegraph
of
himself
for
the
next
half-hour
-LRB-
to
the
great
disturbance
of
*NL*
my
aunt
's
mind
-RRB-
,
to
enjoin
inviolable
secresy
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
surprise
I
heard
no
more
about
it
for
some
two
or
three
weeks
,
*NL*
though
I
was
sufficiently
interested
in
the
result
of
his
endeavours
;
*NL*
descrying
a
strange
gleam
of
good
sense
--
I
say
nothing
of
good
feeling
,
*NL*
for
that
he
always
exhibited
--
in
the
conclusion
to
which
he
had
come
.
At
*NL*
last
I
began
to
believe
,
that
,
in
the
flighty
and
unsettled
state
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
he
had
either
forgotten
his
intention
or
abandoned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
fair
evening
,
when
Dora
was
not
inclined
to
go
out
,
my
aunt
and
I
*NL*
strolled
up
to
the
Doctor
's
cottage
.
It
was
autumn
,
when
there
were
no
*NL*
debates
to
vex
the
evening
air
;
and
I
remember
how
the
leaves
smelt
like
*NL*
our
garden
at
Blunderstone
as
we
trod
them
under
foot
,
and
how
the
old
,
*NL*
unhappy
feeling
,
seemed
to
go
by
,
on
the
sighing
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
twilight
when
we
reached
the
cottage
.
Mrs.
Strong
was
just
coming
*NL*
out
of
the
garden
,
where
Mr.
Dick
yet
lingered
,
busy
with
his
knife
,
*NL*
helping
the
gardener
to
point
some
stakes
.
The
Doctor
was
engaged
with
*NL*
some
one
in
his
study
;
but
the
visitor
would
be
gone
directly
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Strong
said
,
and
begged
us
to
remain
and
see
him
.
We
went
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
with
her
,
and
sat
down
by
the
darkening
window
.
There
was
*NL*
never
any
ceremony
about
the
visits
of
such
old
friends
and
neighbours
*NL*
as
we
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
sat
here
many
minutes
,
when
Mrs.
Markleham
,
who
usually
*NL*
contrived
to
be
in
a
fuss
about
something
,
came
bustling
in
,
with
her
*NL*
newspaper
in
her
hand
,
and
said
,
out
of
breath
,
``
My
goodness
gracious
,
*NL*
Annie
,
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
there
was
some
one
in
the
Study
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
mama
,
''
she
quietly
returned
,
``
how
could
I
know
that
you
desired
*NL*
the
information
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Desired
the
information
!
''
said
Mrs.
Markleham
,
sinking
on
the
sofa
.
``
I
*NL*
never
had
such
a
turn
in
all
my
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
the
Study
then
,
mama

asked
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Been
_
to
the
Study
,
my
dear
!
''
she
returned
emphatically
.
``
Indeed
I
*NL*
have
!
I
came
upon
the
amiable
creature
--
if
you
'll
imagine
my
feelings
,
*NL*
Miss
Trotwood
and
David
--
in
the
act
of
making
his
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
daughter
looked
round
from
the
window
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
act
,
my
dear
Annie
,
''
repeated
Mrs.
Markleham
,
spreading
the
*NL*
newspaper
on
her
lap
like
a
table-cloth
,
and
patting
her
hands
upon
it
,
*NL*
``
of
making
his
last
Will
and
Testament
.
The
foresight
and
affection
*NL*
of
the
dear
!
I
must
tell
you
how
it
was
.
I
really
must
,
in
justice
to
*NL*
the
darling
--
for
he
is
nothing
less
!
--
tell
you
how
it
was
.
Perhaps
*NL*
you
know
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
that
there
is
never
a
candle
lighted
in
this
*NL*
house
,
until
one
's
eyes
are
literally
falling
out
of
one
's
head
with
*NL*
being
stretched
to
read
the
paper
.
And
that
there
is
not
a
chair
in
*NL*
this
house
,
in
which
a
paper
can
be
what
_
I
_
call
,
read
,
except
one
in
*NL*
the
Study
.
This
took
me
to
the
Study
,
where
I
saw
a
light
.
I
opened
the
*NL*
door
.
In
company
with
the
dear
Doctor
were
two
professional
people
,
*NL*
evidently
connected
with
the
law
,
and
they
were
all
three
standing
*NL*
at
the
table
:
the
darling
Doctor
pen
in
hand
.
`
This
simply
expresses
*NL*
then
,
'
said
the
Doctor
--
Annie
,
my
love
,
attend
to
the
very
words

`
this
*NL*
simply
expresses
then
,
gentlemen
,
the
confidence
I
have
in
Mrs.
Strong
,
*NL*
and
gives
her
all
unconditionally
?
'
One
of
the
professional
people
*NL*
replied
,
`
And
gives
her
all
unconditionally
.
'
Upon
that
,
with
the
*NL*
natural
feelings
of
a
mother
,
I
said
,
`
Good
God
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
'
*NL*
fell
over
the
door-step
,
and
came
away
through
the
little
back
passage
*NL*
where
the
pantry
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Strong
opened
the
window
,
and
went
out
into
the
verandah
,
where
she
*NL*
stood
leaning
against
a
pillar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

Miss
Trotwood

said
*NL*
Mrs.

,
mechanically
following
her
with
her
eyes

``

It
only
shows
how

I
was

I
said
to
Annie
,
when
*NL*
Doctor
Strong
paid
a
very
flattering
visit
to
myself
,
and
made
her
the
*NL*

a
declaration

an
offer

I
said
,

*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
bell
rang
,

we
heard
the
sound
of
the

feet

they
*NL*
went
out

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

after
listening

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
conscious
of
Mr.
Dick
's
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
room
,
*NL*
shutting
up
his
knife
,
when
we
accompanied
her
to
the
Study
;
and
of
my
*NL*
aunt
's
rubbing
her
nose
violently
,
by
the
way
,
as
a
mild
vent
for
her
*NL*
intolerance
of
our
military
friend
;
but
who
got
first
into
the
Study
,
or
*NL*
how
Mrs.
Markleham
settled
herself
in
a
moment
in
her
easy
chair
,
or
how
*NL*
my
aunt
and
I
came
to
be
left
together
near
the
door
-LRB-
unless
her
eyes
*NL*
were
quicker
than
mine
,
and
she
held
me
back
-RRB-
,
I
have
forgotten
,
if
I
*NL*
ever
knew
.
But
this
I
know
,
--
that
we
saw
the
Doctor
before
he
saw
us
,
*NL*
sitting
at
his
table
,
among
the
folio
volumes
in
which
he
delighted
,
*NL*
resting
his
head
calmly
on
his
hand
.
That
,
in
the
same
moment
,
we
saw
*NL*
Mrs.
Strong
glide
in
,
pale
and
trembling
.
That
Mr.
Dick
supported
her
on
*NL*
his
arm
.
That
he
laid
his
other
hand
upon
the
Doctor
's
arm
,
causing
him
*NL*
to
look
up
with
an
abstracted
air
.
That
,
as
the
Doctor
moved
his
head
,
*NL*
his
wife
dropped
down
on
one
knee
at
his
feet
,
and
,
with
her
hands
*NL*
imploringly
lifted
,
fixed
upon
his
face
the
memorable
look
I
had
never
*NL*
forgotten
.
That
at
this
sight
Mrs.
Markleham
dropped
the
newspaper
,
and
*NL*
stared
more
like
a
figure-head
intended
for
a
ship
to
be
called
The

Astonishment

than
anything

him
-RRB-
,
I
see
and
hear
,
rather
than
remember
,
as
I
write
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor

''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
What
is
it
that
's
amiss

Look
here

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
the
Doctor
.
``
Not
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
beg
and
pray
that
no

will
leave
the
room

Oh

my
*NL*
husband

break
this
long
silence

Let
us
both
know
what
it
is
*NL*
that
has
come
between
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Markleham
,
by
this
time
recovering
the
power
of
speech
,
and
seeming
*NL*
to
swell
with
family
pride
and
motherly
indignation
,
here
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Annie
,
get
up
immediately
,
and
do
n't
disgrace
everybody
belonging
to
*NL*
you
by
humbling
yourself

unless
you
wish

see
me
go
out
of
*NL*
my
mind
on

spot

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mama
!
''
returned
Annie
.
``
Waste
no
words
on
me
,
for
my
appeal
is
to
my

even
you
are

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.

.
``
Me

nothing

The

taken
*NL*
leave
of
her
senses

Please
to
get
me
a
glass
of
water
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
too
attentive
to
the
Doctor
and
his
wife
,
to
give
any
heed
to
this
*NL*
request
;
and
it
made
no
impression
on
anybody
else
;
so
Mrs.
Markleham
*NL*
panted
,
stared
,
and
fanned
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
!
''
said
the
Doctor
,
tenderly
taking
her
in
his
hands
.
``
My
dear
!
If
*NL*
any
unavoidable
change
has
come
,
in
the
sequence
of

upon
our
*NL*
married
life
,
you
are
not
to
blame
.
The
fault
is
mine
,
and
only
mine
.
*NL*
There
is
no
change
in
my
affection
,
admiration
,
and
respect

I
wish
to
*NL*
make
you
happy

I
truly
love

honor
you

Rise
,
Annie
,
pray
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
rise
.
After
looking
at
him
for
a
little
while
,
she
sank
*NL*
down
closer
to
him
,
laid
her
arm
across
his
knee
,
and
dropping
her
head
*NL*
upon
it
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
any
friend
here
,
who
can
speak
one
word
for
me
,
or
for
my

husband

in
this
matter
;
if
I
have
any
friend
here
,
who
can
give
a
voice
*NL*
to
any
suspicion
that
my

has
sometimes
whispered
to
me

if
I
have
*NL*
any

who
honors
my

or
has
ever
cared
for

*NL*
has
anything
within
his
knowledge
,
no
matter
what
it
is
,
that
may
help
*NL*
to
mediate
between
us
,
I
implore
that
friend
to
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
profound
silence
.
After
a
few
moments
of
painful
hesitation
,
*NL*
I
broke
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Strong
,
''
I
said
,
``
there
is
something
within
my
knowledge
,
which
I
*NL*
have
been
earnestly
entreated
by
Doctor
Strong
to
conceal
,
and
have
*NL*
concealed
until
to-night
.
But
,
I
believe
the
time
has
come
when
it
would
*NL*
be
mistaken
faith
and
delicacy
to
conceal
it
any
longer
,
and
when
your
*NL*
appeal
absolves
me
from
his
injunction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
face
towards
me
for
a
moment
,
and
I
knew
that
I
was
*NL*
right
.
I
could
not
have
resisted
its
entreaty
,
if
the
assurance
that
it
*NL*
gave
me
had
been
less
convincing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
future
peace
,
''
she
said
,
``
may
be
in
your
hands
.
I
trust
it
*NL*
confidently
to
your
not
suppressing
anything
.
I
know
beforehand
that
*NL*
nothing
you
,
or
any
one
,
can
tell
me
,
will
show
my
husband
's
noble
heart
*NL*
in
any
other
light
than
one
.
Howsoever
it
may
seem
to
you
to
touch
me
,
*NL*
disregard
that
.
I
will
speak
for
myself
,
before
him
,
and
before
God
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
earnestly
besought
,
I
made
no
reference
to
the
Doctor
for
his
*NL*
permission
,
but
,
without
any
other
compromise
of
the
truth
than
a
little
*NL*
softening
of
the
coarseness
of
Uriah
Heep
,
related
plainly
what
had
*NL*
passed
in
that
same
room
that
night
.
The
staring
of
Mrs.
Markleham
*NL*
during
the
whole
narration
,
and
the
shrill
,
sharp
interjections
with
*NL*
which
she
occasionally
interrupted
it
,
defy
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
finished
,
Annie
remained
,
for
some
few
moments
,
silent
,
with
*NL*
her
head
bent
down
,
as
I
have
described
.
Then
,
she
took
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
hand
-LRB-
he
was
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
as
when
we
had
entered
the
*NL*
room
-RRB-
,
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
,
and
kissed
it
.
Mr.
Dick
softly
*NL*
raised
her
;
and
she
stood
,
when
she
began
to
speak
,
leaning
on
him
,
and
*NL*
looking
down
upon
her
husband
--
from
whom
she
never
turned
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
has
ever
been
in
my
mind
,
since
I
was
married
,
''
she
said
in
a
*NL*
low
,
submissive
,
tender
voice
,
``
I
will
lay
bare
before
you
.
I
could
not
*NL*
live
and
have
one
reservation
,
knowing
what
I

now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

Annie
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
mildly
,
``
I
have
never
doubted
you

*NL*
child

There
is
no

indeed
there

no

my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
great
need

''
she
answered
,
in
the
same
way
,
``
that
I
should
*NL*
open
my
whole
heart
before
the
soul
of
generosity

truth

by

and

I

loved

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

interrupted
Mrs.
Markleham
,
``

I
have
any
discretion
at
*NL*
all

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``

you

observed
my
aunt

in
an
indignant
*NL*
whisper

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*

``
I
must
be
permitted
to
observe
that
it

not
be
requisite
to
enter

into
these
details

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
but
my
husband
can
judge
of
that

mama

said
Annie
,
without
*NL*
removing
her
eyes
from
his
face
,
``
and
he
will
hear
me

If
I
say
anything
*NL*

give
you
pain

I

borne

often

long

myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my

gasped
Mrs.
Markleham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
very
young

''
said
Annie
,
``
quite
a
little
child
,
my
first
*NL*
associations
with
knowledge
of
any

were
inseparable
from
a
patient
*NL*
friend
and
teacher
--
the
friend
of
my
dead
father
--
who
was
always
dear
to
*NL*
me
.
I
can
remember
nothing
that
I
know
,
without
remembering
him
.
He
*NL*
stored
my
mind
with
its
first
treasures
,
and
stamped
his
character
upon
*NL*
them
all
.
They
never
could
have
been
,
I
think
,
as
good
as
they
have
been
*NL*
to
me
,
if
I
had
taken
them
from
any
other
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
Makes

nothing

exclaimed
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so

said
Annie

I
make
him
what
he

I
must

*NL*
As
I
grew
up

he
occupied
the

place
still

I
was
proud
of
his
*NL*
interest

deeply

fondly

gratefully
attached

him

I
looked
up

him
*NL*
I
can
hardly
describe
how

as
a
father

as
a
guide

as
one
whose
praise
*NL*
was
different
from
all

praise
,
as
one
in
whom
I
could
have
trusted
*NL*
and
confided
,
if
I
had
doubted
all
the
world

You
know

how
young
*NL*
and
inexperienced
I
was

you
presented
him

of

sudden

*NL*
as
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
mentioned

my

*NL*

It

*NL*
Annie

still
preserving
the

look

tone

``
that

agitated

distressed

I

a

so
great

in
the
*NL*
character

I
had
so
long
looked
up

I
think
I
was
sorry

But
nothing

have
made
him
what

stood
quite

I
had
been
he
,
I
would
have
*NL*
tried
to
do
it
,
at
the
cost
of
almost
any
hardship
.
But
I
thought
no
*NL*
worse
of
him
,
until
the
night
of
his
departure
for
India
.
That
night
I
*NL*
knew
he
had
a
false
and
thankless
heart
.
I
saw
a
double
meaning
,
then
,
*NL*
in
Mr.
Wickfield
's
scrutiny
of
me
.
I
perceived
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
*NL*
dark
suspicion
that
shadowed
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suspicion
,
Annie
!
''
said
the
Doctor
.
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
your
mind
there
was
none
,
I
know
,
my
husband
!
''
she
returned
.
``
And
*NL*
when
I
came
to
you
,
that
night
,
to
lay
down
all
my
load
of
shame
and
*NL*
grief
,
and
knew
that
I
had
to
tell
,
that
,
underneath
your
roof
,
one
of
*NL*
my
own
kindred
,
to
whom
you
had
been
a
benefactor
,
for
the
love
of
me
,
*NL*
had
spoken
to
me
words
that
should
have
found
no
utterance
,
even
if
I
*NL*
had
been
the
weak
and
mercenary
wretch
he
thought
me
--
my
mind
revolted
*NL*
from
the
taint
the
very
tale
conveyed
.
It
died
upon
my
lips
,
and
from
*NL*
that
hour
till
now
has
never
passed
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Markleham
,
with
a
short
groan
,
leaned
back
in
her
easy
chair
;
and
*NL*
retired
behind
her
fan
,
as
if
she
were
never
coming
out
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
,
but
in
your
presence
,
interchanged
a
word
with
him
from
*NL*
that
time
;
then
,
only
when
it
has
been
necessary
for
the
avoidance
of
*NL*
this
explanation
.
Years
have
passed
since
he
knew
,
from
me
,
what
his
*NL*
situation
here
was
.
The
kindnesses
you
have
secretly
done
for
his
*NL*
advancement
,
and
then
disclosed
to
me
,
for
my
surprise
and
pleasure
,
*NL*
have
been
,
you
will
believe
,
but
aggravations
of
the
unhappiness
and
*NL*
burden
of
my
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sunk
down
gently
at
the
Doctor
's
feet
,
though
he
did
his
utmost
to
*NL*
prevent
her
;
and
said
,
looking
up
,
tearfully
,
into
his
face
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
speak
to
me
yet
!
Let
me
say
a
little
more
!
Right
or
wrong
,
if
*NL*
this
were
to
be
done
again
,
I
think
I
should
do
just
the
same
.
You
never
*NL*
can
know
what
it
was
to
be
devoted
to
you
,
with
those
old
associations
;
*NL*
to
find
that
any
one
could
be
so
hard
as
to
suppose
that
the
truth
of
my
*NL*
heart
was
bartered
away
,
and
to
be
surrounded
by
appearances
confirming
*NL*
that
belief
.
I
was
very
young
,
and
had
no
adviser
.
Between
mama
and
me
,
*NL*
in
all
relating
to
you
,
there
was
a
wide
division
.
If
I
shrunk
into
*NL*
myself
,
hiding
the
disrespect
I
had
undergone
,
it
was
because
I
honored
*NL*
you
so
much
,
and
so
much
wished
that
you
should
honor
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
my
pure
heart
!
''
said
the
Doctor
,
``
my
dear
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
more
!
a
very
few
words
more
!
I
used
to
think
there
were
so
*NL*
many
whom
you
might
have
married
,
who
would
not
have
brought
such
charge
*NL*
and
trouble
on
you
,
and
who
would
have
made
your
home
a
worthier
home
.
I
*NL*
used
to
be
afraid
that
I
had
better
have
remained
your
pupil
,
and
almost
*NL*
your
child
.
I
used
to
fear
that
I
was
so
unsuited
to
your
learning
and
*NL*
wisdom
.
If
all
this
made
me
shrink
within
myself
-LRB-
as
indeed
it
did
-RRB-
,
*NL*
when
I
had
that
to
tell
,
it
was
still
because
I
honored
you
so
much
,
and
*NL*
hoped
that
you
might
one
day
honor
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
day
has
shone
this
long
time

Annie

said
the
Doctor
,
``
and
can
*NL*
have
but
one
long
night
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
word
!
I
afterwards
meant
--
stedfastly
meant
,
and
purposed
to
*NL*
myself
--
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
knowing
the
unworthiness
of
one
*NL*
to
whom
you
had
been
so
good
.
And
now
a
last
word
,
dearest
and
best
*NL*
of
friends
!
The
cause
of
the
late
change
in
you
,
which
I
have
seen
*NL*
with
so
much
pain
and
sorrow
,
and
have
sometimes
referred
to
my
old
*NL*
apprehension
--
at
other
times
to
lingering
suppositions
nearer
to
*NL*
the
truth
--
has
been
made
clear
to-night
;
and
by
an
accident
I
have
*NL*
also
come
to
know
,
to-night
,
the
full
measure
of
your
noble
trust
in
*NL*
me
,
even
under
that
mistake
.
I
do
not
hope
that
any
love
and
duty
*NL*
I
may
render
in
return
,
will
ever
make
me
worthy
of
your
priceless
*NL*
confidence
;
but
with
all
this
knowledge
fresh
upon
me
,
I
can
lift
my
*NL*
eyes
to
this
dear
face
,
revered
as
a
father
's
,
loved
as
a
husband
's
,
*NL*
sacred
to
me
in
my
childhood
as
a
friend
's
,
and
solemnly
declare
that
*NL*
in
my
lightest
thought
I
have
never
wronged
you
;
never
wavered
in
the
*NL*
love
and
the
fidelity
I
owe
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
arms
around
the
Doctor
's
neck
,
and
he
leant
his
head
down
*NL*
over
her
,
mingling
his
grey
hair
with
her
dark
brown
tresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hold
me
to
your
heart
,
my

Never
cast
me
out

Do
not
think
*NL*
or
speak
of
disparity
between
us
,
for
there
is
none
,
except
in
all
my
*NL*
many
imperfections

Every
succeeding
year
I
have
known
this
better
,
as
I
*NL*
have
esteemed
you
more
and
more
.
Oh
,
take
me
to
your
heart
,
my
husband
,
*NL*
for
my
love
was
founded
on
a
rock
,
and
it
endures
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
silence
that
ensued
,
my
aunt
walked
gravely
up
to
Mr.
Dick
,
*NL*
without
at
all
hurrying
herself
,
and
gave
him
a
hug
and
a
sounding
kiss
.
*NL*
And
it
was
very
fortunate
,
with
a
view
to
his
credit
,
that
she
did
so
;
*NL*
for
I
am
confident
that
I
detected
him
at
that
moment
in
the
act
of
*NL*
making
preparations
to
stand
on
one
leg
,
as
an
appropriate
expression
of
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
very
remarkable
man
,
Dick
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
unqualified
approbation
;
``
and
never
pretend
to
be
anything
else
,
for
I
*NL*
know
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
my
aunt
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
,
and
nodded
to
me
;
and
we
*NL*
three
stole
quietly
out
of
the
room
,
and
came
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
settler
for
our
military
friend
,
at
any
rate
,

said
my
aunt
,
*NL*
on
the
way
home
.
``
I
should
sleep
the
better
for
that
,
if
there
was
*NL*
nothing
else
to
be
glad
of
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
quite
overcome
,
I
am
afraid

''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
with
great
*NL*
commiseration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Did
you
ever
see
a
crocodile
overcome
?
''
inquired
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
saw
a
crocodile

returned
Mr.
Dick
,
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
would
have
been
anything
the
matter

if
it
had
n't
been
for

old

said
my
aunt
,
with
strong
emphasis
.
``
It
's
very
much
to
*NL*
be
wished
that
some
mothers
would
leave
their
daughters
alone
after

and
not
be
so
violently
affectionate

They
seem
to
think
the
*NL*
only
return
that
can
be
made
them
for
bringing
an
unfortunate
young
*NL*
woman
into
the
world

God
bless

asked
to
be
brought

wanted

is
full
liberty

worry
her
out
of
it
again

What
*NL*
are
you
thinking

Trot

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
thinking
of
all
that
had
been
said
.
My
mind
was
still
running
on
*NL*
some
of
the
expressions
used
.
``
There
can
be
no
disparity
in
marriage
*NL*
like
unsuitability
of
mind
and
purpose

first
mistaken
impulse
of

undisciplined
heart

``
My
love
was
founded

But
we
were
at
*NL*
home
;
and
the
trodden
leaves
were
lying
under-foot
,
and
the
autumn
wind
*NL*
was
blowing

CHAPTER
XLVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
INTELLIGENCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
have
been
married
,
if
I
may
trust
to
my
imperfect
memory
for
*NL*
dates
,
about
a
year
or
so
,
when
one
evening
,
as
I
was
returning
from
a
*NL*
solitary
walk
,
thinking
of
the
book
I
was
then
writing
--
for
my
success
*NL*
had
steadily
increased
with
my
steady
application
,
and
I
was
engaged
at
*NL*
that
time
upon
my
first
work
of
fiction
--
I
came
past
Mrs.
Steerforth
's
*NL*
house
.
I
had
often
passed
it
before
,
during
my
residence
in
that
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
though
never
when
I
could
choose
another
road
.
Howbeit
,
*NL*
it
did
sometimes
happen
that
it
was
not
easy
to
find
another
,
without
*NL*
making
a
long
circuit
;
and
so
I
had
passed
that
way
,
upon
the
whole
,
*NL*
pretty
often
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
done
more
than
glance
at
the
house
,
as
I
went
by
with
a
*NL*
quickened
step
.
It
had
been
uniformly
gloomy
and
dull
.
None
of
the
best
*NL*
rooms
abutted
on
the
road
;
and
the
narrow
,
heavily-framed
old-fashioned
*NL*
windows
,
never
cheerful
under
any
circumstances
,
looked
very
dismal
,
*NL*
close
shut
,
and
with
their
blinds
always
drawn
down
.
There
was
a
covered
*NL*
way
across
a
little
paved
court
,
to
an
entrance
that
was
never
used
;
and
*NL*
there
was
one
round
staircase
window
,
at
odds
with
all
the
rest
,
and
the
*NL*
only
one
unshaded
by
a
blind
,
which
had
the
same
unoccupied
blank
look
.
*NL*
I
do
not
remember
that
I
ever
saw
a
light
in
all
the
house
.
If
I
had
*NL*
been
a
casual
passer-by
,
I
should
have
probably
supposed
that
some
*NL*
childless
person
lay
dead
in
it
.
If
I
had
happily
possessed
no
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
place
,
and
had
seen
it
often
in
that
changeless
state
,
I
should
*NL*
have
pleased
my
fancy
with
many
ingenious
speculations
,
I
dare
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
was
,
I
thought
as
little
of
it
as
I
might
.
But
my
mind
could
not
*NL*
go
by
it
and
leave
it
,
as
my
body
did
;
and
it
usually
awakened
a
long
*NL*
train
of
meditations
.
Coming
before
me
,
on
this
particular
evening
that
*NL*
I
mention
,
mingled
with
the
childish
recollections
and
later
fancies
,
*NL*
the
ghosts
of
half-formed
hopes
,
the
broken
shadows
of
disappointments
*NL*
dimly
seen
and
understood
,
the
blending
of
experience
and
imagination
,
*NL*
incidental
to
the
occupation
with
which
my
thoughts
had
been
busy
,
it
*NL*
was
more
than
commonly
suggestive
.
I
fell
into
a
brown
study
as
I
walked
*NL*
on
,
and
a
voice
at
my
side
made
me
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
woman
's
voice
,
too
.
I
was
not
long
in
recollecting
Mrs.
*NL*
Steerforth
's
little
parlor-maid
,
who
had
formerly
worn
blue
ribbons
in
*NL*
her
cap
.
She
had
taken
them
out
now
,
to
adapt
herself
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
*NL*
altered
character
of
the
house
;
and
wore
but
one
or
two
disconsolate
*NL*
bows
of
sober
brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
walk
in
,
and
speak
*NL*
to
Miss
Dartle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Miss
Dartle
sent
you
for
me
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-night
,
sir
,
but
it
's
just
the
same
.
Miss
Dartle
saw
you
pass
a
*NL*
night
or
two
ago
;
and
I
was
to
sit
at
work
on
the
staircase
,
and
when
I
*NL*
saw
you
pass
again
,
to
ask
you
to
step
in
and
speak
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
back
,
and
inquired
of
my
conductor
,
as
we
went
along
,
how
Mrs.
*NL*
Steerforth
was
.
She
said
her
lady
was
but
poorly
,
and
kept
her
own
room
*NL*
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
arrived
at
the
house
,
I
was
directed
to
Miss
Dartle
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
left
to
make
my
presence
known
to
her
myself
.
She
was
*NL*
sitting
on
a
seat
at
one
end
of
a
kind
of
terrace
,
overlooking
the
great
*NL*
city
.
It
was
a
sombre
evening
,
with
a
lurid
light
in
the
sky
;
and
as
I
*NL*
saw
the
prospect
scowling
in
the
distance
,
with
here
and
there
some
*NL*
larger
object
starting
up
into
the
sullen
glare
,
I
fancied
it
was
no
*NL*
inapt
companion
to
the
memory
of
this
fierce
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
me
as
I
advanced
,
and
rose
for
a
moment
to
receive
me
.
I
thought
*NL*
her
,
then
,
still
more
colorless
and
thin
than
when
I
had
seen
her
last
;
*NL*
the
flashing
eyes
still
brighter
,
and
the
scar
still
plainer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
meeting
was
not
cordial
.
We
had
parted
angrily
on
the
last
occasion
;
*NL*
and
there
was
an
air
of
disdain
about
her
,
which
she
took
no
pains
to
*NL*
conceal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
told
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
,
Miss
Dartle
;
''
said
I
,
standing
near
*NL*
her
,
with
my
hand
upon
the
back
of
the
seat
,
and
declining
her
gesture
*NL*
of
invitation
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
''
said
she
.
``
Pray
has
this

``
No

*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
her
thin
lips
working
while
she
looked
at
me
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
eager
to
load
her
with
reproaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
away

''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

From
him

she
said
with
a
laugh
.
``
If
she

not
found

perhaps
*NL*
she
never
will
be
found

She
may
be
dead

*NL*
*NL*
The
vaunting
cruelty
with
which
she
met
my
glance
,
I
never
saw
expressed
*NL*
in
any
other
face
that
ever
I
have
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
wish
her
dead

''
said
I
,
``
may
be
the
kindest
wish
that
one
of
her

*NL*
sex

glad
that
time
has
softened
you
so
much

Miss
Dartle

*NL*
*NL*
She
condescended
to
make
no
reply
,
but
,
turning
on
me
with
another
*NL*
scornful
laugh
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
friends
of
this
excellent

much-injured

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
with
an
ill-favored
smile
,
and
,
taking
a
few
steps
towards
*NL*
a
wall
of
holly
that
was
near
at
hand
,
dividing
the
lawn
from
a
*NL*
kitchen-garden
,
said
,
in
a
louder
voice
,
``
Come
here
!
''
--
as
if
she
were
*NL*
calling
to
some
unclean
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
restrain
any
demonstrative
championship

vengeance

Mr.
Copperfield

said
she
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
*NL*
at
me
with
the
same
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
inclined
my
head
,
without
knowing
what
she
meant
;
and
she
said
,
``
Come
*NL*
here
!
''
again
;
and
returned
,
followed
by
the
respectable
Mr.
Littimer
,
*NL*
who
,
with
undiminished
respectability
,
made
me
a
bow
,
and
took
up
his
*NL*
position
behind
her
.
The
air
of
wicked
grace
:
of
triumph
,
in
which
,
*NL*
strange
to
say
,
there
was
yet
something
feminine
and
alluring
:
with
*NL*
which
she
reclined
upon
the
seat
between
us
,
and
looked
at
me
,
was
*NL*
worthy
of
a
cruel
Princess
in
a
Legend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
she
,
imperiously
,
without
glancing
at
him
,
and
touching
the
*NL*
old
wound
as
it
throbbed
:
perhaps
,
in
this
instance
,
with
pleasure
*NL*
rather
than
pain
.
``
Tell
Mr.
Copperfield
about
the
flight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
James

myself

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
interrupted
,
with
a
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
James

myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor

said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Littimer
,
without
being
at
all
discomposed
,
signified
by
a
slight
*NL*
obeisance
,
that
anything
that
was
most
agreeable
to
us
was
most
*NL*
agreeable
to
him
;
and
began
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
James
and
myself
have
been
abroad
with
the
young
woman
,
ever
since
*NL*
she
left
Yarmouth
under
Mr.
James
's
protection
.
We
have
been
in
a
*NL*
variety
of
places
,
and
seen
a
deal
of
foreign
country
.
We
have
been
in
*NL*
France
,
Switzerland
,
Italy
,
in
fact
,
almost
all
parts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
back
of
the
seat
,
as
if
he
were
addressing
himself
to
*NL*
that
;
and
softly
played
upon
it
with
his
hands
,
as
if
he
were
striking
*NL*
chords
upon
a
dumb
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
James
took
quite
uncommonly
to
the
young
woman
;
and
was
more
*NL*
settled
,
for
a
length
of
time
,
than
I
have
known
him
to
be
since
I
have
*NL*
been
in
his
service
.
The
young
woman
was
very
improvable
,
and
spoke
the
*NL*
languages
;
and
would
n't
have
been
known
for
the
same
country-person
.
I
*NL*
noticed
that
she
was
much
admired
wherever
we
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
put
her
hand
upon
her
side
.
I
saw
him
steal
a
glance
at
her
,
*NL*
and
slightly
smile
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
admired
,
indeed
,
the
young
woman
was
.
What
with
her
dress
;
*NL*
what
with
the
air
and
sun
;
what
with
being
made
so
much
of
;
what
with
*NL*
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
;
her
merits
really
attracted
general
notice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
short
pause
.
Her
eyes
wandered
restlessly
over
the
distant
*NL*
prospect
,
and
she
bit
her
nether
lip
to
stop
that
busy
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
his
hands
from
the
seat
,
and
placing
one
of
them
within
the
*NL*
other
,
as
he
settled
himself
on
one
leg
,
Mr.
Littimer
proceeded
,
with
*NL*
his
eyes
cast
down
,
and
his
respectable
head
a
little
advanced
,
and
a
*NL*
little
on
one
side
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
woman
went
on
in
this
manner
for
some
time
,
being
*NL*
occasionally
low
in
her
spirits
,
until
I
think
she
began
to
weary
Mr.
*NL*
James
by
giving
way
to
her
low
spirits
and
tempers
of
that
kind
;
and
*NL*
things
were
not
so
comfortable
.
Mr.
James
he
began
to
be
restless
again
.
*NL*
The
more
restless
he
got
,
the
worse
she
got
;
and
I
must
say
,
for
myself
,
*NL*
that
I
had
a
very
difficult
time
of
it
indeed
between
the
two
.
Still
*NL*
matters
were
patched
up
here
,
and
made
good
there
,
over
and
over
again
;
*NL*
and
altogether
lasted
,
I
am
sure
,
for
a
longer
time
than
anybody
could
*NL*
have
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Recalling
her
eyes
from
the
distance
,
she
looked
at
me
again
now
,
with
*NL*
her
former
air
.
Mr.
Littimer
,
clearing
his
throat
behind
his
hand
with
a
*NL*
respectable
short-cough
,
changed
legs
,
and
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
,
when
there
had
been
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
good
many
words
and
*NL*
reproaches
,
Mr.
James
he
set
off
one
morning
,
from
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
Naples
,
where
we
had
a
villa
-LRB-
the
young
woman
being
very
partial
to
the
*NL*
sea
-RRB-
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
coming
back
in
a
day
or
so
,
left
it
in
*NL*
charge
with
me
to
break
it
out
,
that
,
for
the
general
happiness
of
all
*NL*
concerned
,
he
was
''
--
here
an
interruption
of
the
short
cough
--
``
gone
.
But
*NL*
Mr.
James
,
I
must
say
,
certainly
did
behave
extremely
honorable
;
for
he
*NL*
proposed
that
the
young
woman
should
marry
a
very
respectable
person
,
*NL*
who
was
fully
prepared
to
overlook
the
past
,
and
who
was
,
at
least
,
as
*NL*
good
as
anybody
the
young
woman
could
have
aspired
to
in
a
regular
way
:
*NL*
her
connexions
being
very
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
changed
legs
again
,
and
wetted
his
lips
.
I
was
convinced
that
the
*NL*
scoundrel
spoke
of
himself
,
and
I
saw
my
conviction
reflected
in
Miss
*NL*
Dartle
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
I
also
had
it
in
charge
to
communicate

I
was
willing
to
do
*NL*
anything
to
relieve
Mr.
James
from
his
difficulty
,
and
to
restore
*NL*
harmony
between
himself
and
an
affectionate
parent
,
who
has
undergone
so
*NL*
much
on
his
account
.
Therefore
I
undertook
the
commission
.
The
young
*NL*
woman
's
violence
when
she
came
to
,
after
I
broke
the
fact
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
was
beyond
all
expectations
.
She
was
quite
mad
,
and
had
to
be
*NL*
held
by
force
;
or
,
if
she
could
n't
have
got
to
a
knife
,
or
got
to
the
*NL*
sea
,
she
'd
have
beaten
her
head
against
the
marble
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
,
leaning
back
upon
the
seat
,
with
a
light
of
exultation
in
*NL*
her
face
,
seemed
almost
to
caress
the
sounds
this
fellow
had
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
I
came
to
the
second
part
of
what
had
been
entrusted
to
me

''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Littimer
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
uneasily
,
``
which
anybody
might
*NL*
have
supposed

have
been

at
all
events

appreciated

a

intention

then
the
young
woman
came
out
in
her
true
colors
.
A
more
*NL*
outrageous
person
I
never
did
see
.
Her
conduct
was
surprisingly
bad

She
*NL*
had
no

gratitude

no
more
feeling
,
no
more
patience
,
no
more
reason
*NL*
in
her
,
than
a
stock
or
a
stone
.
If
I
had
n't
been
upon
my
guard
,
I
am
*NL*
convinced
she
would
have
had
my
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
the
better
of
her
for
it

said
I
,
indignantly

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

bent
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Indeed
,
sir

But
you
're
*NL*
young

and
resumed
his
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
necessary
,
in
short

for
a

to
take
away
everything
nigh

her

she
could
do
herself
,
or
anybody
else
,
an
injury
with
,
and
to
*NL*
shut
her
up
close
.
Notwithstanding
which
,
she
got
out
in
the
night
;
*NL*
forced
the
lattice
of
a
window
,
that
I
had
nailed
up
myself
;
dropped
on
*NL*
a
vine
that
was
trailed
below
;
and
never
has
been
seen

heard
of

to
*NL*
my
knowledge

since

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
dead
,
perhaps

said
Miss
Dartle
,
with
a
smile
,
as
if
she
could
*NL*
have
spurned
the
body
of
the
ruined
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
have
drownded

Mr.

catching

at
an
excuse

addressing
himself
to
somebody

``
It
's
very
possible

Or

she

had
assistance

wives

Being
given
to
low
company

she
was
very
much
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
talking
to
them
on
the
beach

Miss
Dartle

sitting
by
their

boats

I
have
known

been
away

Mr.

was
far
from
pleased

find

once

that

had
told
the

children

was
a
boatman

that
in

own
country

long

she
had
roamed
about

*NL*
Oh

What
a
picture
rose
before
me
of
her
sitting
*NL*
on
the
far-off
shore

among
the
children
like
herself
when
she
was
*NL*
innocent

listening
to
little
voices
such
as
might
have
called
her

Mother
had
she
been
a
poor
man

wife
;
and
to
the
great
voice
of
the
*NL*
sea

with
its
eternal
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
``

that

insulted

Knowing

unfortunate
difference

what
her
anxiety

glanced
at

He
remained
calm

silent

with
his

fixed
on

the

tip

every

delicately
poised

the
liberty
of
reminding
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
that
he
can
put
a
question
to
me
.
I
have
a
character
to
*NL*
maintain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
momentary
struggle
with
myself
,
I
turned
my
eyes
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
You
have
heard
my
question
.
Consider
it
addressed
to
yourself
,
if
*NL*
you
choose
.
What
answer
do
you
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
he
rejoined
,
with
an
occasional
separation
and
reunion
of
those
*NL*
delicate
tips
,
``
my
answer
must
be
qualified
;
because
,
to
betray
Mr.
*NL*
James
's
confidence
to
his
mother
,
and
to
betray
it
to
you
,
are
two
*NL*
different
actions
.
It
is
not
probable
,
I
consider
,
that
Mr.
James
would
*NL*
encourage
the
receipt
of
letters
likely
to
increase
low
spirits
and
*NL*
unpleasantness
;
but
further
than
that
,
sir
,
I
should
wish
to
avoid
*NL*
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
enquired
Miss
Dartle
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
indicated
that
I
had
nothing
more
to
say
.
``
Except
,
''
I
added
,
as
I
saw
*NL*
him
moving
off
,
``
that
I
understand
this
fellow
's
part
in
the
wicked
*NL*
story
,
and
that
,
as
I
shall
make
it
known
to
the
honest
man
who
has
been
*NL*
her
father
from
her
childhood
,
I
would
recommend
him
to
avoid
going
too
*NL*
much
into
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stopped
the
moment
I
began
,
and
had
listened
with
his
usual
*NL*
repose
of
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
But
you
'll
excuse
me
if
I
say
,
sir
,
that
there
are
*NL*
neither
slaves
nor
slave-drivers
in
this
country
,
and
that
people
are
*NL*
not
allowed
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
.
If
they
do
,
it
is
more
*NL*
to
their
own
peril
,
I
believe
,
than
to
other
people
's
.
Consequently
*NL*
speaking
,
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
going
wherever
I
may
wish
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
he
made
me
a
polite
bow
;
and
,
with
another
to
Miss
Dartle
,
*NL*
went
away
through
the
arch
in
the
wall
of
holly
by
which
he
had
come
.
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
and
I
regarded
each
other
for
a
little
while
in
silence
;
her
*NL*
manner
being
exactly
what
it
was
,
when
she
had
produced
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
besides
,
''
she
observed
,
with
a
slow
curling
of
her
lip
,
``
that
*NL*
his
master
,
as
he
hears
,
is
coasting
Spain
;
and
this
done
,
is
away
to
*NL*
gratify
his
seafaring
tastes
till
he
is
weary
.
But
that
is
of
no
*NL*
interest
to
you
.
Between
these
two
proud
persons
,
mother
and
son
,
there
*NL*
is
a
wider
breach
than
before
,
and
little
hope
of
its
healing
,
for
they
*NL*
are
one
at
heart
,
and
time
makes
each
more
obstinate
and
imperious
.
*NL*
Neither
is
this
of
any
interest
to
you
;
but
it
introduces
what
I
wish
to
*NL*
say
.
This
devil
whom
you
make
an
angel
of
,
I
mean
this
low
girl
whom
he
*NL*
picked
out
of
the
tide-mud
,
''
with
her
black
eyes
full
upon
me
,
and
her
*NL*
passionate
finger
up
,
``
may
be
alive
,
--
for
I
believe
some
common
things
*NL*
are
hard
to
die
.
If
she
is
,
you
will
desire
to
have
a
pearl
of
such
*NL*
price
found
and
taken
care
of
.
We
desire
that
,
too
;
that
he
may
not
by
*NL*
any
chance
be
made
her
prey
again
.
So
far
,
we
are
united
in
one
*NL*
interest
;
and
that
is
why
I
,
who
would
do
her
any
mischief
that
so
*NL*
coarse
a
wretch
is
capable
of
feeling
,
have
sent
for
you
to
hear
what
*NL*
you
have
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
,
by
the
change
in
her
face
,
that
some
one
was
advancing
behind
me
.
*NL*
It
was
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
who
gave
me
her
hand
more
coldly
than
of
yore
,
*NL*
and
with
an
augmentation
of
her
former
stateliness
of
manner
;
but
still
,
*NL*
I
perceived
--
and
I
was
touched
by
it
--
with
an
ineffaceable
remembrance
*NL*
of
my
old
love
for
her
son
.
She
was
greatly
altered
.
Her
fine
figure
was
*NL*
far
less
upright
,
her
handsome
face
was
deeply
marked
,
and
her
hair
was
*NL*
almost
white
.
But
when
she
sat
down
on
the
seat
,
she
was
a
handsome
lady
*NL*
still
;
and
well
I
knew
the
bright
eye
with
its
lofty
look
,
that
had
been
*NL*
a
light
in
my
very
dreams
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Copperfield
informed
of
everything
,
Rosa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
has
he
heard
Littimer
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
have
told
him
why
you
wished
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
good
girl
.
I
have
had
some
slight
correspondence
with
your
*NL*
former
friend
,
sir
,
''
addressing
me
,
``
but
it
has
not
restored
his
sense
*NL*
of
duty
or
natural
obligation
.
Therefore
I
have
no
other
object
in
this
,
*NL*
than
what
Rosa
has
mentioned
.
If
,
by
the
course
which
may
relieve
the
*NL*
mind
of
the
decent
man
you
brought
here

for
whom
I
am
sorry

I
can
say
*NL*
no
more
-RRB-
,
my
son
may
be
saved
from
again
falling
into
the
snares
of
a
*NL*
designing
enemy
,
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
herself
up
,
and
sat
looking
straight
before
her
,
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
I
said
respectfully
,
``
I
understand
.
I
assure
you
I
am
in
no
*NL*
danger
of
putting
any
strained
construction
on
your
motives
.
But
I
must
*NL*
say
,
even
to
you
,
having
known
this
injured
family
from
childhood
,
that
*NL*
if
you
suppose
the
girl
,
so
deeply
wronged
,
has
not
been
cruelly
*NL*
deluded
,
and
would
not
rather
die
a
hundred
deaths
than
take
a
cup
of
*NL*
water
from
your
son
's
hand
now
,
you
cherish
a
terrible
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Rosa
,
well
!
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
as
the
other
was
about
to
*NL*
interpose
,
``
it
is
no
matter
.
Let
it
be
.
You
are
married
,
sir
,
I
am
*NL*
told
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
that
I
had
been
some
time
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
doing
well
?
I
hear
little
in
the
quiet
life
I
lead
,
but
I
*NL*
understand
you
are
beginning
to
be
famous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
very
fortunate
,
''
I
said
,
``
and
find
my
name
connected
with
*NL*
some
praise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
mother
?
''
--
in
a
softened
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
,
''
she
returned
.
``
She
would
have
been
proud
of
you
.
Good
*NL*
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
hand
she
held
out
with
a
dignified
,
unbending
air
,
and
it
was
*NL*
as
calm
in
mine
as
if
her
breast
had
been
at
peace
.
Her
pride
could
*NL*
still
its
very
pulses
it
appeared
,
and
draw
the
placid
veil
before
her
*NL*
face
,
through
which
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
on
the
far
*NL*
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
moved
away
from
them
along
the
terrace
,
I
could
not
help
observing
*NL*
how
steadily
they
both
sat
gazing
on
the
prospect
,
and
how
it
thickened
*NL*
and
closed
around
them
.
Here
and
there
,
some
early
lamps
were
seen
to
*NL*
twinkle
in
the
distant
city
;
and
in
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
sky
the
*NL*
lurid
light
still
hovered
.
But
,
from
the
greater
part
of
the
broad
*NL*
valley
interposed
,
a
mist
was
rising
like
a
sea
,
which
,
mingling
with
*NL*
the
darkness
,
made
it
seem
as
if
the
gathering
waters
would
encompass
*NL*
them
.
I
have
reason
to
remember
this
,
and
think
of
it
with
awe
;
for
*NL*
before
I
looked
upon
those
two
again
,
a
stormy
sea
had
risen
to
their
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reflecting
on
what
had
been
thus
told
me
,
I
felt
it
right
that
it
should
*NL*
be
communicated
to
Mr.
Peggotty
.
On
the
following
evening
I
went
into
*NL*
London
in
quest
of
him
.
He
was
always
wandering
about
from
place
to
*NL*
place
,
with
his
one
object
of
recovering
his
niece
before
him
;
but
was
*NL*
more
in
London
than
elsewhere
.
Often
and
often
,
now
,
had
I
seen
him
in
*NL*
the
dead
of
night
passing
along
the
streets
,
searching
,
among
the
few
*NL*
who
loitered
out
of
doors
at
those
untimely
hours
,
for
what
he
dreaded
*NL*
to
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
a
lodging
over
the
little
chandler
's
shop
in
Hungerford
Market
,
*NL*
which
I
have
had
occasion
to
mention
more
than
once
,
and
from
which
he
*NL*
first
went
forth
upon
his
errand
of
mercy
.
Hither
I
directed
my
walk
.
On
*NL*
making
inquiry
for
him
,
I
learned
from
the
people
of
the
house
that
he
*NL*
had
not
gone
out
yet
,
and
I
should
find
him
in
his
room
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
reading
by
a
window
in
which
he
kept
a
few
plants
.
The
*NL*
room
was
very
neat
and
orderly
.
I
saw
in
a
moment
that
it
was
always
*NL*
kept
prepared
for
her
reception
,
and
that
he
never
went
out
but
he
*NL*
thought
it
possible
he
might
bring
her
home
.
He
had
not
heard
my
tap
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
only
raised
his
eyes
when
I
laid
my
hand
upon
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
!
Thankee
,
sir
!
thankee
hearty
,
for
this
visit
!
Sit
ye
down
.
*NL*
You
're
kindly
welcome
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Peggotty
,
''
said
I
,
taking
the
chair
he
handed
me
,
``
do
n't
expect
*NL*
much
!
I
have
heard
some
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Em
`
ly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
,
in
a
nervous
manner
,
on
his
mouth
,
and
turned
pale
,
as
*NL*
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gives
no
clue
to
where
she
is
;
but
she
is
not
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
,
looking
intently
at
me
,
and
listened
in
profound
silence
to
*NL*
all
I
had
to
tell
.
I
well
remember
the
sense
of
dignity
,
beauty
even
,
*NL*
with
which
the
patient
gravity
of
his
face
impressed
me
,
when
,
having
*NL*
gradually
removed
his
eyes
from
mine
,
he
sat
looking
downward
,
leaning
*NL*
his
forehead
on
his
hand
.
He
offered
no
interruption
,
but
remained
*NL*
throughout
perfectly
still
.
He
seemed
to
pursue
her
figure
through
the
*NL*
narrative
,
and
to
let
every
other
shape
go
by
him
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
done
,
he
shaded
his
face
,
and
continued
silent
.
I
looked
out
*NL*
of
the
window
for
a
little
while
,
and
occupied
myself
with
the
plants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
fare
to
feel
about
it
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
?
''
he
inquired
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
she
is
living
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doe
n't
know
.
Maybe
the
first
shock
was
too
rough
,
and
in
the
wildness
*NL*
of
her
art
--
!
That
there
blue
water
as
she
used
to
speak
on
.
Could
she
*NL*
have
thowt
o
'
that
so
many
year
,
because
it
was
to
be
her
grave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
,
musing
,
in
a
low
,
frightened
voice
;
and
walked
across
the
*NL*
little
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
he
added
,
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
I
have
felt
so
sure
as
she
was
*NL*
living
--
I
have
know
'd
,
awake
and
sleeping
,
as
it
was
so
trew
that
I
*NL*
should
find
her
--
I
have
been
so
led
on
by
it
,
and
held
up
by
it
--
that
I
*NL*
doe
n't
believe
I
can
have
been
deceived
.
No
!
Em
`
ly
's
alive

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
down
firmly
on
the
table
,
and
set
his
sunburnt
face
into
*NL*
a
resolute
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
niece
,
Em
`
ly
,
is
alive
,

!

he
said
,
stedfastly
.
``
I
doe
n't
know

wheer
it
comes
from

or
how
't
is
,
but

told
_
as
she
's
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
almost
like
a
man
inspired
,
as
he
said
it
.
I
waited
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
until
he
could
give
me
his
undivided
attention
;
and
then
*NL*
proceeded
to
explain
the
precaution
,
that
,
it
had
occurred
to
me
last
*NL*
night
,
it
would
be
wise
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
friend
--
''
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
thankee
,
kind
sir

he
said
,
grasping
my
hand
in
both
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
should
make
her
way
to
London
,
which
is
likely

for
where
could
*NL*
she
lose
herself
so
readily
as
in
this
vast
city
;
and
what
would
she
*NL*
wish
to
do
,
but
lose
and
hide
herself
,
if
she
does
not
go
home
?

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
wo
n't
go
home

he
interposed
,
shaking
his
head
mournfully
.
``
If
*NL*
she
had
left
of
her
own
accord

she
might

not

was

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
should
come
here

said
I
,
``
I
believe
there
is
one
person

more
likely
to
discover

any

Do

what
I
say

of

you
remember
Martha

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
our

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
needed
no
other
answer
than
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
she
is
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
her
in
the
streets

''
he
answered
,
with
a
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
know
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
Emily
was
charitable
to
her
,
with
*NL*
Ham
's
help
,
long
before
she
fled
from
home
.
Nor
,
that
,
when
we
met
one
*NL*
night
,
and
spoke
together
in
the
room
yonder
,
over
the
way
,
she
listened
*NL*
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
replied
in
astonishment
.
``
That

it
snew
so
*NL*
hard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
night

I
have
never
seen
her
since

I
went
back
,
after
parting
*NL*
from
you

to
speak
to
her
,
but
she
was
gone
.
I
was
unwilling
to
mention
*NL*
her
to
you
then
,
and
I
am
now
;
but
she
is
the
person
of
whom
I
speak
,
*NL*
and
with
whom
I
think
we
should
communicate
.
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
well
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
.
We
had
sunk
our
voices
,
almost
to
a
*NL*
whisper
,
and
continued
to
speak
in
that
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
have
seen
her
.
Do
you
think
that
you
could
find
her

I
*NL*
could
only
hope
to
do
so
by
chance

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Mas

Davy
,
I
know
wheer
to
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
dark

Being
together
,
shall
we
go
out
now
,
and
try
to
find
her
*NL*
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
assented
,
and
prepared
to
accompany
me
.
Without
appearing
to
observe
*NL*
what
he
was
doing
,
I
saw
how
carefully
he
adjusted
the
little
room
,
put
*NL*
a
candle
ready
and
the
means
of
lighting
it
,
arranged
the
bed
,
and
*NL*
finally
took
out
of
a
drawer
one
of
her
dresses
-LRB-
I
remembered
to
have
*NL*
seen
her
wear
it
-RRB-
,
neatly
folded
with
some
other
garments
,
and
a
bonnet
,
*NL*
which
he
placed
upon
a
chair
.
He
made
no
allusion
to
these
clothes
,
*NL*
neither
did
I
.
There
they
had
been
waiting
for
her
,
many
and
many
a
*NL*
night
,
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
was
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
said
,
as
we
came
down
stairs
,
``
when
I
*NL*
thowt
this
girl
,
Martha

a
`
most
like

's

feet

God
forgive
me
,
there
's
a
difference
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
went
along
,
partly
to
hold
him
in
conversation
,
and
partly
to
*NL*
satisfy
myself
,
I
asked
him
about
Ham
.
He
said
,
almost
in
the
same
words
*NL*
as
formerly
,
that
Ham
was
just
the
same
,
``
wearing
away
his
life
with
*NL*
kiender
no
care
nohow
for
`
t
;
but
never
murmuring
,
and
liked
by
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
Ham
's
state
of
mind
was
,
in
reference
to
the
*NL*
cause
of
their
misfortunes
?
Whether
he
believed
it
was
dangerous
?
What
*NL*
he
supposed
,
for
example
,
Ham
would
do
,
if
he
and
Steerforth
ever
should
*NL*
encounter
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doe
n't
know
,

,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
have
thowt
of
it
oftentimes
,
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
arrize
myself
of
it

no
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
recalled
to
his
remembrance
the
morning
after
her
departure
,
when
we
*NL*
were
all
three
on
the
beach
.
``
Do
you
recollect
,
''
said
I
,
``
a
certain
wild
*NL*
way
in
which
he
looked
out
to
sea
,
and
spoke
about
`
the
end
of
it
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
I
do
!

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
suppose
he
meant
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
replied
,
``
I
've
put
the

never
found

And
theer
's
one
curous
thing

that

*NL*
though
he
is
so
pleasant
,
I
would
n't
fare
to
feel
comfortable
to
try

*NL*
get
his

He
never

could
be

it

'd
begin
to
speak
any

now
;
but
it
's
fur
from
being
fleet
water
in
his

where
*NL*
them
thowts
lays

It
's
deep

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

said
I
,
``

sometimes
made

anxious

he
rejoined

``
Even

I

I
doe

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
come
,
through
Temple
Bar
,
into
the
city
.
Conversing
no
more
now
,
*NL*
and
walking
at
my
side
,
he
yielded
himself
up
to
the
one
aim
of
his
*NL*
devoted
life
,
and
went
on
,
with
that
hushed
concentration
of
his
*NL*
faculties
which
would
have
made
his
figure
solitary
in
a
multitude
.
We
*NL*
were
not
far
from
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
when
he
turned
his
head
and
*NL*
pointed
to
a
solitary
female
figure
flitting
along
the
opposite
side
of
*NL*
the
street
.
I
knew
it
,
readily
,
to
be
the
figure
that
we
sought
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
crossed
the
road
,
and
were
pressing
on
towards
her
,
when
it
occurred
*NL*
to
me
that
she
might
be
more
disposed
to
feel
a
woman
's
interest
in
the
*NL*
lost
girl
,
if
we
spoke
to
her
in
a
quieter
place
,
aloof
from
the
crowd
,
*NL*
and
where
we
should
be
less
observed
.
I
advised
my
companion
,
therefore
,
*NL*
that
we
should
not
address
her
yet
,
but
follow
her
;
consulting
in
this
,
*NL*
likewise
,
an
indistinct
desire
I
had
,
to
know
where
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
acquiescing
,
we
followed
at
a
distance
:
never
losing
sight
of
her
,
*NL*
but
never
caring
to
come
very
near
,
as
she
frequently
looked
about
.
*NL*
Once
,
she
stopped
to
listen
to
a
band
of
music
;
and
then
we
stopped
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
a
long
way
.
Still
we
went
on
.
It
was
evident
,
from
the
*NL*
manner
in
which
she
held
her
course
,
that
she
was
going
to
some
fixed
*NL*
destination
;
and
this
,
and
her
keeping
in
the
busy
streets
,
and
,
I
*NL*
suppose
the
strange
fascination
in
the
secresy
and
mystery
of
so
*NL*
following
any
one
,
made
me
adhere
to
my
first
purpose
.
At
length
she
*NL*
turned
into
a
dull
,
dark
street
,
where
the
noise
and
crowd
were
lost
;
*NL*
and
I
said
,
``
We
may
speak
to
her
now
;
''
and
,
mending
our
pace
,
we
went
*NL*
after
her
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
MARTHA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
now
down
in
Westminster
.
We
had
turned
back
to
follow
her
,
*NL*
having
encountered
her
coming
towards
us
;
and
Westminster
Abbey
was
the
*NL*
point
at
which
she
passed
from
the
lights
and
noise
of
the
leading
*NL*
streets
.
She
proceeded
so
quickly
,
when
she
got
free
of
the
two
currents
*NL*
of
passengers
setting
towards
and
from
the
bridge
,
that
,
between
this
*NL*
and
the
advance
she
had
of
us
when
she
struck
off
,
we
were
in
the
narrow
*NL*
water-side
street
by
Millbank
before
we
came
up
with
her
.
At
that
moment
*NL*
she
crossed
the
road
,
as
if
to
avoid
the
footsteps
that
she
heard
so
*NL*
close
behind
;
and
,
without
looking
back
,
passed
on
even
more
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glimpse
of
the
river
through
a
dull
gateway
,
where
some
waggons
were
*NL*
housed
for
the
night
,
seemed
to
arrest
my
feet
.
I
touched
my
companion
*NL*
without
speaking
,
and
we
both
forbore
to
cross
after
her
,
and
both
*NL*
followed
on
that
opposite
side
of
the
way
;
keeping
as
quietly
as
we
*NL*
could
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
,
but
keeping
very
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
and
is
when
I
write
,
at
the
end
of
that
low-lying
street
,
*NL*
a
dilapidated
little
wooden
building
,
probably
an
obsolete
old
*NL*
ferry-house
.
Its
position
is
just
at
that
point
where
the
street
*NL*
ceases
,
and
the
road
begins
to
lie
between
a
row
of
houses
and
the
*NL*
river
.
As
soon
as
she
came
here
,
and
saw
the
water
,
she
stopped
as
if
*NL*
she
had
come
to
her
destination
;
and
presently
went
slowly
along
by
the
*NL*
brink
of
the
river
,
looking
intently
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
here
,
I
had
supposed
that
she
was
going
to
some
house
;
*NL*
indeed
,
I
had
vaguely
entertained
the
hope
that
the
house
might
be
in
*NL*
some
way
associated
with
the
lost
girl
.
But
,
that
one
dark
glimpse
of
*NL*
the
river
,
through
the
gateway
,
had
instinctively
prepared
me
for
her
*NL*
going
no
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbourhood
was
a
dreary
one
at
that
time
;
as
oppressive
,
sad
,
and
*NL*
solitary
by
night
,
as
any
about
London
.
There
were
neither
wharves
nor
*NL*
houses
on
the
melancholy
waste
of
road
near
the
great
blank
Prison
.
A
*NL*
sluggish
ditch
deposited
its
mud
at
the
prison
walls
.
Coarse
grass
and
*NL*
rank
weeds
straggled
over
all
the
marshy
land
in
the
vicinity
.
In
one
*NL*
part
,
carcases
of
houses
,
inauspiciously
begun
and
never
finished
,
*NL*
rotted
away
.
In
another
,
the
ground
was
cumbered
with
rusty
iron
*NL*
monsters
of
steam-boilers
,
wheels
,
cranks
,
pipes
,
furnaces
,
paddles
,
*NL*
anchors
,
diving-bells
,
windmill-sails
,
and
I
know
not
what
strange
*NL*
objects
,
accumulated
by
some
speculator
,
and
grovelling
in
the
dust
,
*NL*
underneath
which
--
having
sunk
into
the
soil
of
their
own
weight
in
wet
*NL*
weather
--
they
had
the
appearance
of
vainly
trying
to
hide
themselves
.
*NL*
The
clash
and
glare
of
sundry
fiery
Works
upon
the
river
side
,
arose
by
*NL*
night
to
disturb
everything
except
the
heavy
and
unbroken
smoke
that
*NL*
poured
out
of
their
chimneys
.
Slimy
gaps
and
causeways
,
winding
among
*NL*
old
wooden
piles
,
with
a
sickly
substance
clinging
to
the
latter
,
like
*NL*
green
hair
,
and
the
rags
of
last
year
's
handbills
offering
rewards
for
*NL*
drowned
men
fluttering
above
high-water
mark
,
led
down
through
the
ooze
*NL*
and
slush
to
the
ebb
tide
.
There
was
a
story
that
one
of
the
pits
dug
*NL*
for
the
dead
in
the
time
of
the
Great
Plague
was
hereabout
;
and
a
*NL*
blighting
influence
seemed
to
have
proceeded
from
it
over
the
whole
*NL*
place
.
Or
else
it
looked
as
if
it
had
gradually
decomposed
into
that
*NL*
nightmare
condition
,
out
of
the
overflowings
of
the
polluted
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
she
were
a
part
of
the
refuse
it
had
cast
out
,
and
left
to
*NL*
corruption
and
decay
,
the
girl
we
had
followed
strayed
down
to
the
*NL*
river
's
brink
,
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
this
night-picture
,
lonely
*NL*
and
still
,
looking
at
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

The

.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
boats
and
barges
astrand
in
the
mud
,
and
these
enabled
*NL*
us
to
come
within
a
few
yards
of
her
without
being
seen
.
I
then
signed
*NL*
to
Mr.
Peggotty
to
remain
where
he
was
,
and
emerged
from
their
shade
to
*NL*
speak
to
her
.
I
did
not
approach
her
solitary
figure
without
trembling
;
*NL*
for
this
gloomy
end
to
her
determined
walk
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
*NL*
stood
,
almost
within
the
cavernous
shadow
of
the
iron
bridge
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
lights
crookedly
reflected
in
the
strong
tide
,
inspired
a
dread
*NL*
within
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
she
was
talking
to
herself
.
I
am
sure
,
although
absorbed
in
*NL*
gazing
at
the
water
,
that
her
shawl
was
off
her
shoulders
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
muffling
her
hands
in
it
,
in
an
unsettled
and
bewildered
way
,
more
*NL*
like
the
action
of
a
sleep-walker
than
a
waking
person
.
I
know
,
and
*NL*
never
can
forget
,
that
there
was
that
in
her
wild
manner
which
gave
me
*NL*
no
assurance
but
that
she
would
sink
before
my
eyes
,
until
I
had
her
arm
*NL*
within
my
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
I
said
``
Martha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
uttered
a
terrified
scream
,
and
struggled
with
me
with
such
strength
*NL*
that
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
held
her
alone
.
But
a
stronger
hand
than
*NL*
mine
was
laid
upon
her
;
and
when
she
raised
her
frightened
eyes
and
saw
*NL*
whose
it
was
,
she
made
but
one
more
effort
,
and
dropped
down
between
us
.
*NL*
We
carried
her
away
from
the
water
to
where
there
were
some
dry
stones
,
*NL*
and
there
laid
her
down
,
crying
and
moaning
.
In
a
little
while
she
sat
*NL*
among
the
stones
,
holding
her
wretched
head
with
both
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
river
!
''
she
cried
passionately
.
``
Oh
,
the
river
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
hush
!
''
said
I.
``
Calm
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
still
repeated
the
same
words
,
continually
exclaiming
,
``
Oh
,
the
*NL*
river
!
''
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
's
like
me
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
I
know
that
I
belong
to
it
.
I
*NL*
know
that
it
's
the
natural
company
of
such
as
I
am
!
It
comes
from
*NL*
country
places
,
where
there
was
once
no
harm
in
it
--
and
it
creeps
*NL*
through
the
dismal
streets
,
defiled
and
miserable
--
and
it
goes
away
,
*NL*
like
my
life
,
to
a
great
sea
,
that
is
always
troubled
--
and
I
feel
that
I
*NL*
must
go
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
known
what
despair
was
,
except
in
the
tone
of
those
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
keep
away
from
it
.
I
ca
n't
forget
it
.
It
haunts
me
day
and
*NL*
night
.
It
's
the
only
thing
in
all
the
world
that
I
am
fit
for
,
or
that
's
*NL*
fit
for
me
.
Oh
,
the
dreadful
river
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
passed
through
my
mind
that
in
the
face
of
my
companion
,
as
*NL*
he
looked
upon
her
without
speech
or
motion
,
I
might
have
read
his
*NL*
niece
's
history
,
if
I
had
known
nothing
of
it
.
I
never
saw
,
in
any
*NL*
painting
or
reality
,
horror
and
compassion
so
impressively
blended
.
He
*NL*
shook
as
if
he
would
have
fallen
;
and
his
hand
--
I
touched
it
with
my
*NL*
own
,
for
his
appearance
alarmed
me
--
was
deadly
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
in
a
state
of
frenzy
,
''
I
whispered
to
him
.
``
She
will
speak
*NL*
differently
in
a
little
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
he
would
have
said
in
answer
.
He
made
some
motion
with
*NL*
his
mouth
,
and
seemed
to
think
he
had
spoken
;
but
he
had
only
pointed
to
*NL*
her
with
his
outstretched
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
burst
of
crying
came
upon
her
now
,
in
which
she
once
more
hid
her
*NL*
face
among
the
stones
,
and
lay
before
us
,
a
prostrate
image
of
*NL*
humiliation
and
ruin
.
Knowing
that
this
state
must
pass
,
before
we
could
*NL*
speak
to
her
with
any
hope
,
I
ventured
to
restrain
him
when
he
would
*NL*
have
raised
her
,
and
we
stood
by
in
silence
until
she
became
more
*NL*
tranquil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
,
''
said
I
then
,
leaning
down
,
and
helping
her
to
rise
--
she
seemed
*NL*
to
want
to
rise
as
if
with
the
intention
of
going
away
,
but
she
was
*NL*
weak
,
and
leaned
against
a
boat
.
``
Do
you
know
who
this
is
,
who
is
with
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
faintly
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
we
have
followed
you
a
long
way
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
She
looked
neither
at
him
nor
at
me
,
but
stood
in
a
*NL*
humbled
attitude
,
holding
her
bonnet
and
shawl
in
one
hand
,
without
*NL*
appearing
conscious
of
them
,
and
pressing
the
other
,
clenched
,
against
*NL*
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
composed
enough
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
speak
on
the
subject
which
so
*NL*
interested
you
--
I
hope
Heaven
may
remember
it
!
--
that
snowy
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sobs
broke
out
afresh
,
and
she
murmured
some
inarticulate
thanks
to
*NL*
me
for
not
having
driven
her
away
from
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
say
nothing
for
myself
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
few
moments
.
``
I
am
*NL*
bad
,
I
am
lost
.
I
have
no
hope
at
all
.
But
tell
him
,
sir
,
''
she
had
*NL*
shrunk
away
from
him
,
``
if
you
do
n't
feel
too
hard
to
me
to
do
it
,
that
I
*NL*
never
was
in
any
way
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
never
been
attributed
to
you
,
''
I
returned
,
earnestly
responding
*NL*
to
her
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
,
if
I
do
n't
deceive
myself
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
*NL*
``
that
came
into
the
kitchen
,
the
night
she
took
such
pity
on
me
;
was
so
*NL*
gentle
to
me
;
did
n't
shrink
away
from
me
like
all
the
rest
,
and
gave
me
*NL*
such
kind
help
!
Was
it
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
been
in
the
river
long
ago
,
''
she
said
,
glancing
at
it
*NL*
with
a
terrible
expression
,
``
if
any
wrong
to
her
had
been
upon
my
mind
.
*NL*
I
never
could
have
kept
out
of
it
a
single
winter
's
night
,
if
I
had
not
*NL*
been
free
of
any
share
in
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cause
of
her
flight
is
too
well
understood
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
are
*NL*
innocent
of
any
part
in
it

we
thoroughly
believe

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
might
have
been
much
the
better
for
her
,
if
I
had
had
a
better
*NL*
heart

exclaimed
the
girl
,
with
most
forlorn
regret
;
``
for
she
was
*NL*
always
good
to
me
!
She
never
spoke
a
word
to
me

what
was
pleasant

and
right
.
Is
it
likely
I
would
try
to
make
her
what
I
am
myself
,
*NL*
knowing
what
I
am
myself
,
so
well
!
When
I
lost
everything
that
makes
*NL*
life
dear
,
the
worst
of
all
my
thoughts
was
that
I
was
parted
for
ever
*NL*
from

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
,
standing
with
one
hand
on
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
cast
down
,
put
his
disengaged
hand
before
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
I
heard
what
had
happened
before
that
snowy
night

from
some
*NL*
belonging
to
our
town

cried
Martha
,
``
the
bitterest
thought
in
all
my
*NL*
mind
was
,
that
the
people
would
remember
she
once
kept
company

me
,
*NL*
and
would
say
I
had
corrupted
her
!
When
,
Heaven
knows
,
I
would
have
died
*NL*
to
have
brought
back
her
good
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Long
unused
to
any
self-control
,
the
piercing
agony
of
her
remorse
and
*NL*
grief
was
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
died
,
would
not
have
been
much
--
what
can
I
say
?
--
I
would

!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
would
have
lived
to
be
old

in
the
wretched
*NL*
streets

to
wander
about

avoided

in
the
dark
--
and
to
see
the
day
*NL*
break
on
the
ghastly
lines
of
houses
,
and
remember
how
the
same
sun
used
*NL*
to
shine
into
my
room
,
and
wake
me
once
--
I
would
have
done
even
that
,
to
*NL*
save
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sinking
on
the
stones
,
she
took
some
in
each
hand
,
and
clenched
them
up
,
*NL*
as
if
she
would
have
ground
them
.
She
writhed
into
some
new
posture
*NL*
constantly
:
stiffening
her
arms
,
twisting
them
before
her
face
,
as
*NL*
though
to
shut
out
from
her
eyes
the
little
light
there
was
,
and
*NL*
drooping
her
head
,
as
if
it
were
heavy
with
insupportable
recollections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
ever
do
!
''
she
said
,
fighting
thus
with
her
despair
.
``
How
*NL*
can
I
go
on
as
I
am
,
a
solitary
curse
to
myself
,
a
living
disgrace
to
*NL*
every
one
I
come
near
!
''
Suddenly
she
turned
to
my
companion
.
``
Stamp
*NL*
upon
me
,
kill
me
!
When
she
was
your
pride
,
you
would
have
thought
I
had
*NL*
done
her
harm
if
I
had
brushed
against
her
in
the
street
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
believe
--
why
should
you
?
--
a
syllable
that
comes
out
of
my
lips
.
It
*NL*
would
be
a
burning
shame
upon
you
,
even
now
,
if
she
and
I
exchanged
a
*NL*
word
.
I
do
n't
complain
.
I
do
n't
say
she
and
I
are
alike
--
I
know
there
*NL*
is
a
long
,
long
way
between
us
.
I
only
say
,
with
all
my
guilt
and
*NL*
wretchedness
upon
my
head
,
that
I
am
grateful
to
her
from
my
soul
,
and
*NL*
love
her
.
Oh
do
n't
think
that
all
the
power
I
had
of
loving
anything
,
*NL*
is
quite
worn
out
!
Throw
me
away
,
as
all
the
world
does
.
Kill
me
for
*NL*
being
what
I
am
,
and
having
ever
known
her
;
but
do
n't
think
that
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
upon
her
,
while
she
made
this
supplication
,
in
a
wild
*NL*
distracted
manner
;
and
,
when
she
was
silent
,
gently
raised
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
God
forbid
as
I
should
judge
you

Forbid
*NL*
as
I
,
of
all
men
,
should
do
that
,
my
girl
!
You
doe
n't
know
half
the
*NL*
change
that
's
come
,
in
course
of
time
,
upon
me
,
when
you
think
it
*NL*
likely

Well
!

he
paused
a
moment
,
then
went
on
.
``
You
doe
n't
understand
*NL*
how
't
is
that
this
here
gentleman

me
has
wished

You
*NL*
doe
n't
understand
what
't
is
we
has
afore
us
.
Listen
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
influence
upon
her
was
complete
.
She
stood
,
shrinkingly
,
before
him
,
*NL*
as
if
she
were
afraid
to
meet
his
eyes
;
but
her
passionate
sorrow
was
*NL*
quite
hushed
and
mute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
heerd
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
owt
of
what
passed

he
repeated
*NL*
steadily
.
``
Fur

*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hands
before
her
face
;
but
otherwise
remained
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heerd
her
tell

said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``

Maybe
you
can
guess
that

had
such
a

friend

you
'd
have
got
into
a
way
of
being
fond

*NL*
time

that
my

kiender
daughter-like

*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
silently
trembling
,
he
put
her
shawl
carefully
about
her
,
*NL*
taking
it
up
from
the
ground
for
that
purpose

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
repeated

*NL*
with
a
quiet
assurance
of
the
truth

what
he
said
,
``
there

*NL*
*NL*
I
read
,
in
every
word
of
his
plain
impressive
way
of
delivering
himself
,
*NL*
new
evidence
of
his
having
thought

one
topic

in
every
feature

it
presented

*NL*
*NL*
``

proceeded

*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
hastily
,

for
the
first
time

as

were
*NL*
doubtful
of
what
he
had
said

*NL*
*NL*
``

asked

in

low
voice
of
astonishment

*NL*
*NL*

Full

free

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
asked
hurriedly

*NL*
We
both
replied
together
,
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
up
her
eyes

solemnly
declared
that

devote

herself
to
this
task

fervently

That

*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
raise
her
voice
above
her
breath
,
or
address
us
,
but
said
*NL*
this
to
the
night
sky
;
then
stood
profoundly
quiet
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
gloomy
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
judged
it
expedient
,
now
,
to
tell
her
all
we
knew
;
which
I
recounted
*NL*
at
length
.
She
listened
with
great
attention
,
and
with
a
face
that
often
*NL*
changed
,
but
had
the
same
purpose
in
all
its
varying
expressions
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
occasionally
filled
with
tears
,
but
those
she
repressed
.
It
seemed
*NL*
as
if
her
spirit
were
quite
altered
,
and
she
could
not
be
too
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
,
when
all
was
told
,
where
we
were
to
be
communicated
with
,
if
*NL*
occasion
should
arise
.
Under
a
dull
lamp
in
the
road
,
I
wrote
our
two
*NL*
addresses
on
a
leaf
of
my
pocket-book
,
which
I
tore
out
and
gave
to
her
,
*NL*
and
which
she
put
in
her
poor
bosom
.
I
asked
her
where
she
lived
*NL*
herself
.
She
said
,
after
a
pause
,
in
no
place
long
.
It
were
better
not
*NL*
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
suggesting
to
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
what
had
already
occurred
*NL*
to
myself
,
I
took
out
my
purse
;
but
I
could
not
prevail
upon
her
to
*NL*
accept
any
money
,
nor
could
I
exact
any
promise
from
her
that
she
would
*NL*
do
so
at
another
time
.
I
represented
to
her
that
Mr.
Peggotty
could
not
*NL*
be
called
,
for
one
in
his
condition
,
poor
;
and
that
the
idea
of
her
*NL*
engaging
in
this
search
,
while
depending
on
her
own
resources
,
shocked
*NL*
us
both
.
She
continued
steadfast
.
In
this
particular
,
his
influence
upon
*NL*
her
was
equally
powerless
with
mine
.
She
gratefully
thanked
him
,
but
*NL*
remained
inexorable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
may
be
work
to
be
got
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
take
some
assistance
,
''
I
returned
,
``
until
you
have
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
do
what
I
have
promised
,
for
money
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
could
*NL*
not
take
it
,
if
I
was
starving
.
To
give
me
money
would
be
to
take
away
*NL*
your
trust
,
to
take
away
the
object
that
you
have
given
me
,
to
take
away
*NL*
the
only
certain
thing
that
saves
me
from
the
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
the
great
Judge
,
''
said
I
,
``
before
whom
you
and
all
of
us
*NL*
must
stand
at
his
dread
time
,
dismiss
that
terrible
idea
!
We
can
all
do
*NL*
some
good
,
if
we
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
trembled
,
and
her
lip
shook
,
and
her
face
was
paler
,
as
she
*NL*
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
put
in
your
hearts
,
perhaps
,
to
save
a
wretched
creature
*NL*
for
repentance
.
I
am
afraid
to
think
so
;
it
seems
too
bold
.
If
any
good
*NL*
should
come
of
me
,
I
might
begin
to
hope
;
for
nothing
but
harm
has
ever
*NL*
come
of
my
deeds
yet
.
I
am
to
be
trusted
,
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
*NL*
while
,
with
my
miserable
life
,
on
account
of
what
you
have
given
me
to
*NL*
try
for
.
I
know
no
more
,
and
I
can
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
repressed
the
tears
that
had
begun
to
flow
;
and
,
putting
out
*NL*
her
trembling
hand
,
and
touching
Mr.
Peggotty
,
as
if
there
were
some
*NL*
healing
virtue
in
him
,
went
away
along
the
desolate
road
.
She
had
been
*NL*
ill
,
probably
for
a
long
time
.
I
observed
,
upon
that
closer
opportunity
*NL*
of
observation
,
that
she
was
worn
and
haggard
,
and
that
her
sunken
eyes
*NL*
expressed
privation
and
endurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
followed
her
at
a
short
distance
,
our
way
lying
in
the
same
*NL*
direction
,
until
we
came
back
into
the
lighted
and
populous
streets
.
I
*NL*
had
such
implicit
confidence
in
her
declaration
,
that
I
then
put
it
to
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
,
whether
it
would
not
seem
,
in
the
onset
,
like
distrusting
*NL*
her
,
to
follow
her
any
further
.
He
being
of
the
same
mind
,
and
equally
*NL*
reliant
on
her
,
we
suffered
her
to
take
her
own
road
,
and
took
ours
,
*NL*
which
was
towards
Highgate
.
He
accompanied
me
a
good
part
of
the
way
;
*NL*
and
when
we
parted
,
with
a
prayer
for
the
success
of
this
fresh
effort
,
*NL*
there
was
a
new
and
thoughtful
compassion
in
him
that
I
was
at
no
loss
*NL*
to
interpret
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
midnight
when
I
arrived
at
home
.
I
had
reached
my
own
gate
,
and
*NL*
was
standing
listening
for
the
deep
bell
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
the
sound
of
*NL*
which
I
thought
had
been
borne
towards
me
among
the
multitude
of
*NL*
striking
clocks
,
when
I
was
rather
surprised
to
see
that
the
door
of
my
*NL*
aunt
's
cottage
was
open
,
and
that
a
faint
light
in
the
entry
was
shining
*NL*
out
across
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
that
my
aunt
might
have
relapsed
into
one
of
her
old
alarms
,
*NL*
and
might
be
watching
the
progress
of
some
imaginary
conflagration
in
*NL*
the
distance
,
I
went
to
speak
to
her
.
It
was
with
very
great
surprise
*NL*
that
I
saw
a
man
standing
in
her
little
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
glass
and
bottle
in
his
hand
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
.
I
*NL*
stopped
short
,
among
the
thick
foliage
outside
,
for
the
moon
was
up
now
,
*NL*
though
obscured
;
and
I
recognised
the
man
whom
I
had
once
supposed
to
be
*NL*
a
delusion
of
Mr.
Dick
's
,
and
had
once
encountered
with
my
aunt
in
the
*NL*
streets
of
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
eating
as
well
as
drinking
,
and
seemed
to
eat
with
a
hungry
*NL*
appetite
.
He
seemed
curious
regarding
the
cottage
,
too
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
the
first
time
he
had
seen
it
.
After
stooping
to
put
the
bottle
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
he
looked
up
at
the
windows
,
and
looked
about
;
though
with
a
*NL*
covert
and
impatient
air
,
as
if
he
was
anxious
to
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
in
the
passage
was
obscured
for
a
moment
,
and
my
aunt
came
*NL*
out
.
She
was
agitated
,
and
told
some
money
into
his
hand
.
I
heard
it
*NL*
chink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
this
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
spare
no
more
,
''
returned
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
ca
n't
go
,
''
said
he
.
``
Here
!
You
may
take
it
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bad
man
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
with
great
emotion
;
``
how
can
you
use
me
*NL*
so
?
But
why
do
I
ask
?
It
is
because
you
know
how
weak
I
am
!
What
have
I
*NL*
to
do
,
to
free
myself
for
ever
of
your
visits
,
but
to
abandon
you
to
*NL*
your
deserts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
do
n't
you
abandon
me
to
my
deserts
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
ask
me
why
!
''
returned
my
aunt
.
``
What
a
heart
you
must
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
moodily
rattling
the
money
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
until
at
*NL*
length
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
all
you
mean
to
give
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
I
_
can
_
give
you
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
You
know
I
have
had
losses
,
*NL*
and
am
poorer
than
I
used
to
be
.
I
have
told
you
so
.
Having
got
it
,
why
*NL*
do
you
give
me
the
pain
of
looking
at
you
for
another
moment
,
and
seeing
*NL*
what
you
have
become
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
become
shabby
enough
,
if
you
mean
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
lead
the
*NL*
life
of
an
owl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stripped
me
of
the
greater
part
of
all
I
ever
had
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
``
You
closed
my
heart
against
the
whole
world
,
years
and
years
.
You
*NL*
treated
me
falsely
,
ungratefully
,
and
cruelly
.
Go
,
and
repent
of
it
.
*NL*
Do
n't
add
new
injuries
to
the
long
,
long
list
of
injuries
you
have
done
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
''
he
returned
.
``
It
's
all
very
fine
!
--
Well
!
I
must
do
the
best
I
*NL*
can
,
for
the
present
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
himself
,
he
appeared
abashed
by
my
aunt
's
indignant
tears
,
*NL*
and
came
slouching
out
of
the
garden
.
Taking
two
or
three
quick
steps
,
*NL*
as
if
I
had
just
come
up
,
I
met
him
at
the
gate
,
and
went
in
as
he
came
*NL*
out
.
We
eyed
one
another
narrowly
in
passing
,
and
with
no
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
,
''
said
I
,
hurriedly
.
``
This
man
alarming
you
again
!
Let
me
speak
to
*NL*
him
.
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
taking
my
arm
,
``
come
in
,
and
do
n't
speak
to
*NL*
me
for
ten
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
down
in
her
little
parlor
.
My
aunt
retired
behind
the
round
green
*NL*
fan
of
former
days
,
which
was
screwed
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
wiped
her
eyes
,
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Then
she
*NL*
came
out
,
and
took
a
seat
beside
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
calmly
,
``
it
's
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
,
aunt
?
I
thought
he
had
been
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
to
me
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
``
but
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
in
silent
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Betsey
Trotwood
do
n't
look
a
likely
subject
for
the
tender
passion
,
''
*NL*
said
my
aunt
,
composedly
,
``
but
the
time
was
,
Trot
,
when
she
believed
in
*NL*
that
man
most
entirely
.
When
she
loved
him
,
Trot
,
right
well
.
When
there
*NL*
was
no
proof
of
attachment
and
affection
that
she
would
not
have
given
*NL*
him
.
He
repaid
her
by
breaking
her
fortune
,
and
nearly
breaking
her
*NL*
heart
.
So
she
put
all
that
sort
of
sentiment
,
once
and
for
ever
in
a
*NL*
grave
,
and
filled
it
up
,
and
flattened
it
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
good
aunt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
him
,
''
my
aunt
proceeded
,
laying
her
hand
as
usual
on
the
back
of
*NL*
mine
,
``
generously
.
I
may
say
at
this
distance
of
time
,
Trot
,
that
I
left
*NL*
him
generously
.
He
had
been
so
cruel
to
me
,
that
I
might
have
effected
a
*NL*
separation
on
easy
terms
for
myself
;
but
I
did
not
.
He
soon
made
ducks
*NL*
and
drakes
of
what
I
gave
him
,
sank
lower
and
lower
,
married
another
*NL*
woman
,
I
believe
,
became
an
adventurer
,
a
gambler
,
and
a
cheat
.
What
he
*NL*
is
now
,
you
see
.
But
he
was
a
fine-looking
man
when
I
married
him
,
''
said
*NL*
my
aunt
,
with
an
echo
of
her
old
pride
and
admiration
in
her
tone
;
``
and
*NL*
I
believed
him
--
I
was
a
fool
!
--
to
be
the
soul
of
honor

*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
my
hand
a
squeeze
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
nothing
to
me
now

Trot

less

nothing

But
,
sooner

him
punished
for
his
offences
-LRB-
as
he
would
be
if
he
prowled
about

in

I
give
him
more
money
than
I
can
afford
,
at
intervals
*NL*
when
he
reappears
,
to
go
away
.
I
was
a
fool
when
I
married
him
;
and
I
am
*NL*
so
far
an
incurable
fool
on
that
subject

for
the
sake
of
what
I
*NL*
once
believed
him
to
be

I
would
n't

even
this
shadow

my
idle

fancy
hardly
dealt
with

For
I
was
in
earnest

Trot

if
ever
a
woman
*NL*
was

*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
and
smoothed
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

my

she
said

CHAPTER
XLVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
DOMESTIC
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
labored
hard
at
my
book
,
without
allowing
it
to
interfere
with
the
*NL*
punctual
discharge
of
my
newspaper
duties
;
and
it
came
out
and
was
very
*NL*
successful
.
I
was
not
stunned
by
the
praise
which
sounded
in
my
ears
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
that
I
was
keenly
alive
to
it
,
and
thought
better
of
my
*NL*
own
performance
,
I
have
little
doubt
,
than
anybody
else
did
.
It
has
*NL*
always
been
in
my
observation
of
human
nature
,
that
a
man
who
has
any
*NL*
good
reason
to
believe
in
himself
never
flourishes
himself
before
the
*NL*
faces
of
other
people
in
order
that
they
may
believe
in
him
.
For
this
*NL*
reason
,
I
retained
my
modesty
in
very
self-respect
;
and
the
more
praise
*NL*
I
got
,
the
more
I
tried
to
deserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
my
purpose
,
in
this
record
,
though
in
all
other
essentials
it
*NL*
is
my
written
memory
,
to
pursue
the
history
of
my
own
fictions
.
They
*NL*
express
themselves
,
and
I
leave
them
to
themselves
.
When
I
refer
to
*NL*
them
,
incidentally
,
it
is
only
as
a
part
of
my
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
some
foundation
for
believing
,
by
this
time
,
that
nature
and
*NL*
accident
had
made
me
an
author
,
I
pursued
my
vocation
with
confidence
.
*NL*
Without
such
assurance
I
should
certainly
have
left
it
alone
,
and
*NL*
bestowed
my
energy
on
some
other
endeavour
.
I
should
have
tried
to
find
*NL*
out
what
nature
and
accident
really
had
made
me
,
and
to
be
that
,
and
*NL*
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
writing
,
in
the
newspaper
and
elsewhere
,
so
prosperously
,
*NL*
that
when
my
new
success
was
achieved
,
I
considered
myself
reasonably
*NL*
entitled
to
escape
from
the
dreary
debates
.
One
joyful
night
,
therefore
,
*NL*
I
noted
down
the
music
of
the
parliamentary
bagpipes
for
the
last
time
,
*NL*
and
I
have
never
heard
it
since
;
though
I
still
recognise
the
old
drone
*NL*
in
the
newspapers
,
without
any
substantial
variation
-LRB-
except
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
that
there
is
more
of
it
-RRB-
,
all
the
livelong
session
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
write
of
the
time
when
I
had
been
married
,
I
suppose
,
about
a
year
*NL*
and
a
half
.
After
several
varieties
of
experiment
,
we
had
given
up
the
*NL*
housekeeping
as
a
bad
job
.
The
house
kept
itself
,
and
we
kept
a
page
.
*NL*
The
principal
function
of
this
retainer
was
to
quarrel
with
the
cook
;
in
*NL*
which
respect
he
was
a
perfect
Whittington
,
without
his
cat
,
or
the
*NL*
remotest
chance
of
being
made
Lord
Mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appears
to
me
to
have
lived
in
a
hail
of
saucepan-lids
.
His
whole
*NL*
existence
was
a
scuffle
.
He
would
shriek
for
help
on
the
most
improper
*NL*
occasions
,
--
as
,
when
we
had
a
little
dinner
party
,
or
a
few
friends
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
--
and
would
come
tumbling
out
of
the
kitchen
,
with
iron
*NL*
missiles
flying
after
him
.
We
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
,
but
he
was
very
*NL*
much
attached
to
us
,
and
would
n't
go
.
He
was
a
tearful
boy
,
and
broke
*NL*
into
such
deplorable
lamentations
,
when
a
cessation
of
our
connexion
was
*NL*
hinted
at
,
that
we
were
obliged
to
keep
him
.
He
had
no
mother
--
no
*NL*
anything
in
the
way
of
a
relative
,
that
I
could
discover
,
except
a
*NL*
sister
,
who
fled
to
America
the
moment
we
had
taken
him
off
her
hands
;
*NL*
and
he
became
quartered
on
us
like
a
horrible
young
changeling
.
He
had
a
*NL*
lively
perception
of
his
own
unfortunate
state
,
and
was
always
rubbing
*NL*
his
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
,
or
stooping
to
blow
his
nose
on
*NL*
the
extreme
corner
of
a
little
pocket-handkerchief
,
which
he
never
*NL*
_
would
_
take
completely
out
of
his
pocket
,
but
always
economised
and
*NL*
secreted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unlucky
page
,
engaged
in
an
evil
hour
at
six
pounds
ten
per
annum
,
*NL*
was
a
source
of
continual
trouble
to
me
.
I
watched
him
as
he
grew
--
and
*NL*
he
grew
like
scarlet
beans
--
with
painful
apprehensions
of
the
time
when
*NL*
he
would
begin
to
shave
;
even
of
the
days
when
he
would
be
bald
or
grey
.
*NL*
I
saw
no
prospect
of
ever
getting
rid
of
him
;
and
,
projecting
myself
*NL*
into
the
future
,
used
to
think
what
an
inconvenience
he
would
be
when
he
*NL*
was
an
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
expected
anything
less
,
than
this
unfortunate
's
manner
of
*NL*
getting
me
out
of
my
difficulty
.
He
stole
Dora
's
watch
,
which
,
like
*NL*
everything
else
belonging
to
us
,
had
no
particular
place
of
its
own
;
*NL*
and
,
converting
it
into
money
,
spent
the
produce
-LRB-
he
was
always
a
*NL*
weak-minded
boy
-RRB-
in
incessantly
riding
up
and
down
between
London
*NL*
and
Uxbridge
outside
the
coach
.
He
was
taken
to
Bow
Street
,
as
well
*NL*
as
I
remember
,
on
the
completion
of
his
fifteenth
journey
;
when
*NL*
four-and-sixpence
,
and
a
second-hand
fife
which
he
could
n't
play
,
were
*NL*
found
upon
his
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
and
its
consequences
would
have
been
much
less
disagreeable
*NL*
to
me
if
he
had
not
been
penitent
.
But
he
was
very
penitent
indeed
,
and
*NL*
in
a
peculiar
way
--
not
in
the
lump
,
but
by
instalments
.
For
example
;
the
*NL*
day
after
that
on
which
I
was
obliged
to
appear
against
him
,
he
made
*NL*
certain
revelations
touching
a
hamper
in
the
cellar
,
which
we
believed
*NL*
to
be
full
of
wine
,
but
which
had
nothing
in
it
except
bottles
and
*NL*
corks
.
We
supposed
he
had
now
eased
his
mind
,
and
told
the
worst
he
knew
*NL*
of
the
cook
;
but
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
his
conscience
sustained
a
*NL*
new
twinge
,
and
he
disclosed
how
she
had
a
little
girl
,
who
,
early
every
*NL*
morning
,
took
away
our
bread
;
and
also
how
he
himself
had
been
suborned
*NL*
to
maintain
the
milkman
in
coals
.
In
two
or
three
days
more
,
I
was
*NL*
informed
by
the
authorities
of
his
having
led
to
the
discovery
of
*NL*
sirloins
of
beef
among
the
kitchen-stuff
,
and
sheets
in
the
rag-bag
.
A
*NL*
little
while
afterwards
,
he
broke
out
in
an
entirely
new
direction
,
and
*NL*
confessed
to
a
knowledge
of
burglarious
intentions
as
to
our
premises
,
*NL*
on
the
part
of
the
pot-boy
,
who
was
immediately
taken
up
.
I
got
to
be
so
*NL*
ashamed
of
being
such
a
victim
,
that
I
would
have
given
him
any
money
to
*NL*
hold
his
tongue
,
or
would
have
offered
a
round
bribe
for
his
being
*NL*
permitted
to
run
away
.
It
was
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
the
case
*NL*
that
he
had
no
idea
of
this
,
but
conceived
that
he
was
making
me
amends
*NL*
in
every
new
discovery
:
not
to
say
,
heaping
obligations
on
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
ran
away
myself
,
whenever
I
saw
an
emissary
of
the
police
*NL*
approaching
with
some
new
intelligence
;
and
lived
a
stealthy
life
until
*NL*
he
was
tried
and
ordered
to
be
transported
.
Even
then
he
could
n't
be
*NL*
quiet
,
but
was
always
writing
us
letters
;
and
wanted
so
much
to
see
Dora
*NL*
before
he
went
away
,
that
Dora
went
to
visit
him
,
and
fainted
when
she
*NL*
found
herself
inside
the
iron
bars
.
In
short
I
had
no
peace
of
my
life
*NL*
until
he
was
expatriated
,
and
made
-LRB-
as
I
afterwards
heard
-RRB-
a
shepherd
*NL*
of
,
``
up
the
country
''
somewhere
;
I
have
no
geographical
idea
where
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
led
me
into
some
serious
reflections
,
and
presented
our
*NL*
mistakes
in
a
new
aspect
;
as
I
could
not
help
communicating
to
Dora
one
*NL*
evening
,
in
spite
of
my
tenderness
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
is
very
painful
to
me
to
think
that
our
want
of
*NL*
system
and
management
,
involves
not
only
ourselves
-LRB-
which
we
have
got
*NL*
used
to
-RRB-
,
but
other
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
silent
for
a
long
time
,
and
now
you
are
going
to
be
*NL*
cross
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
indeed
!
Let
me
explain
to
you
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
n't
want
to
know
,
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
you
to
know
,
my
love
.
Put
Jip
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
put
his
nose
to
mine
,
and
said
``
Boh
!
''
to
drive
my
seriousness
away
;
*NL*
but
,
not
succeeding
,
ordered
him
into
his
Pagoda
,
and
sat
looking
at
me
,
*NL*
with
her
hands
folded
,
and
a
most
resigned
little
expression
of
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
my
dear
,
''
I
began
,
``
there
is
contagion
in
us
.
We
infect
*NL*
everyone
about
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
gone
on
in
this
figurative
manner
,
if
Dora
's
face
had
not
*NL*
admonished
me
that
she
was
wondering
with
all
her
might
whether
I
was
*NL*
going
to
propose
any
new
kind
of
vaccination
,
or
other
medical
remedy
,
*NL*
for
this
unwholesome
state
of
ours
.
Therefore
I
checked
myself
,
and
made
*NL*
my
meaning
plainer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
merely
,
my
pet
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
we
lose
money
and
comfort
,
and
*NL*
even
temper
sometimes
,
by
not
learning
to
be
more
careful
;
but
that
we
*NL*
incur
the
serious
responsibility
of
spoiling
everyone
who
comes
into
our
*NL*
service
,
or
has
any
dealings
with
us
.
I
begin
to
be
afraid
that
the
*NL*
fault
is
not
entirely
on
one
side
,
but
that
these
people
all
turn
out
*NL*
ill
because
we
do
n't
turn
out
very
well
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
an
accusation
,
''
exclaimed
Dora
,
opening
her
eyes
wide
;
``
to
say
*NL*
that
you
ever
saw
me
take
gold
watches
!
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
,
''
I
remonstrated
,
``
do
n't
talk
preposterous
nonsense
!
Who
has
*NL*
made
the
least
allusion
to
gold
watches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
''
returned
Dora
.
``
You
know
you
did
.
You
said
I
had
n't
turned
*NL*
out
well
,
and
compared
me
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
page
,
''
sobbed
Dora
.
``
Oh
,
you
cruel
fellow
,
to
compare
your
*NL*
affectionate
wife
to
a
transported
page
!
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
*NL*
your
opinion
of
me
before
we
were
married
?
Why
did
n't
you
say
,
you
*NL*
hard-hearted
thing
,
that
you
were
convinced
I
was
worse
than
a
*NL*
transported
page
?
Oh
,
what
a
dreadful
opinion
to
have
of
me
!
Oh
,
my
*NL*
goodness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Dora
,
my
love
,
''
I
returned
,
gently
trying
to
remove
the
*NL*
handkerchief
she
pressed
to
her
eyes
,
``
this
is
not
only
very
ridiculous
*NL*
of
you
,
but
very
wrong
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
's
not
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
said
he
was
a
story-teller
,
''
sobbed
Dora
.
``
And
now
you
say
*NL*
the
same
of
me
!
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
!
What
shall
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
girl
,
''
I
retorted
,
``
I
really
must
entreat
you
to
be
*NL*
reasonable
,
and
listen
to
what
I
did
say
,
and
do
say
.
My
dear
Dora
,
*NL*
unless
we
learn
to
do
our
duty
to
those
whom
we
employ
,
they
will
never
*NL*
learn
to
do
their
duty
to
us
.
I
am
afraid
we
present
opportunities
to
*NL*
people
to
do
wrong
,
that
never
ought
to
be
presented
.
Even
if
we
were
*NL*
as
lax
as
we
are
,
in
all
our
arrangements
,
by
choice
--
which
we
are
*NL*
not
--
even
if
we
liked
it
,
and
found
it
agreeable
to
be
so
--
which
we
*NL*
do
n't
--
I
am
persuaded
we
should
have
no
right
to
go
on
in
this
way
.
*NL*
We
are
positively
corrupting
people
.
We
are
bound
to
think
of
that
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
it
,
Dora
.
It
is
a
reflection
I
am
unable
to
*NL*
dismiss
,
and
it
sometimes
makes
me
very
uneasy
.
There
,
dear
,
that
's
*NL*
all
.
Come
now
!
Do
n't
be
foolish
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
would
not
allow
me
,
for
a
long
time
,
to
remove
the
handkerchief
.
*NL*
She
sat
sobbing
and
murmuring
behind
it
,
that
,
if
I
was
uneasy
,
why
had
*NL*
I
ever
been
married
?
Why
had
n't
I
said
,
even
the
day
before
we
went
to
*NL*
church
,
that
I
knew
I
should
be
uneasy
,
and
I
would
rather
not
?
If
I
*NL*
could
n't
bear
her
,
why
did
n't
I
send
her
away
to
her
aunts
at
Putney
,
or
*NL*
to
Julia
Mills
in
India
?
Julia
would
be
glad
to
see
her
,
and
would
not
*NL*
call
her
a
transported
page
;
Julia
never
had
called
her
anything
of
the
*NL*
sort
.
In
short
,
Dora
was
so
afflicted
,
and
so
afflicted
me
by
being
in
*NL*
that
condition
,
that
I
felt
it
was
of
no
use
repeating
this
kind
of
*NL*
effort
,
though
never
so
mildly
,
and
I
must
take
some
other
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
other
course
was
left
to
take
!
To
``
form
her
mind
?
''
This
was
a
*NL*
common
phrase
of
words
which
had
a
fair
and
promising
sound
,
and
I
*NL*
resolved
to
form
Dora
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
immediately
.
When
Dora
was
very
childish
,
and
I
would
have
*NL*
infinitely
preferred
to
humour
her
,
I
tried
to
be
grave
--
and
*NL*
disconcerted
her
,
and
myself
too
.
I
talked
to
her
on
the
subjects
which
*NL*
occupied
my
thoughts
;
and
I
read
Shakespeare
to
her
--
and
fatigued
her
to
*NL*
the
last
degree
.
I
accustomed
myself
to
giving
her
,
as
it
were
quite
*NL*
casually
,
little
scraps
of
useful
information
,
or
sound
opinion
--
and
she
*NL*
started
from
them
when
I
let
them
off
,
as
if
they
had
been
crackers
.
No
*NL*
matter
how
incidentally
or
naturally
I
endeavoured
to
form
my
little
*NL*
wife
's
mind
,
I
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
always
had
an
instinctive
*NL*
perception
of
what
I
was
about
,
and
became
a
prey
to
the
keenest
*NL*
apprehensions
.
In
particular
,
it
was
clear
to
me
,
that
she
thought
*NL*
Shakespeare
a
terrible
fellow
.
The
formation
went
on
very
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pressed
Traddles
into
the
service
without
his
knowledge
;
and
whenever
*NL*
he
came
to
see
us
,
exploded
my
mines
upon
him
for
the
edification
of
*NL*
Dora
at
second
hand
.
The
amount
of
practical
wisdom
I
bestowed
upon
*NL*
Traddles
in
this
manner
was
immense
,
and
of
the
best
quality
;
but
it
had
*NL*
no
other
effect
upon
Dora
than
to
depress
her
spirits
,
and
make
her
*NL*
always
nervous
with
the
dread
that
it
would
be
her
turn
next
.
I
found
*NL*
myself
in
the
condition
of
a
schoolmaster
,
a
trap
,
a
pitfall
;
of
always
*NL*
playing
spider
to
Dora
's
fly
,
and
always
pouncing
out
of
my
hole
to
her
*NL*
infinite
disturbance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
looking
forward
through
this
intermediate
stage
,
to
the
time
when
*NL*
there
should
be
a
perfect
sympathy
between
Dora
and
me
,
and
when
I
*NL*
should
have
``
formed
her
mind
''
to
my
entire
satisfaction
,
I
persevered
,
*NL*
even
for
months
.
Finding
at
last
,
however
,
that
,
although
I
had
been
all
*NL*
this
time
a
very
porcupine
or
hedgehog
,
bristling
all
over
with
*NL*
determination
,
I
had
effected
nothing
,
it
began
to
occur
to
me
that
*NL*
perhaps
Dora
's
mind
was
already
formed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
farther
consideration
this
appeared
so
likely
,
that
I
abandoned
my
*NL*
scheme
,
which
had
had
a
more
promising
appearance
in
words
than
in
*NL*
action
;
resolving
henceforth
to
be
satisfied
with
my
child-wife
,
and
to
*NL*
try
to
change
her
into
nothing
else
by
any
process
.
I
was
heartily
tired
*NL*
of
being
sagacious
and
prudent
by
myself
,
and
of
seeing
my
darling
under
*NL*
restraint
;
so
,
I
bought
a
pretty
pair
of
ear-rings
for
her
,
and
a
collar
*NL*
for
Jip
,
and
went
home
one
day
to
make
myself
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
was
delighted
with
the
little
presents
,
and
kissed
me
joyfully
;
*NL*
but
,
there
was
a
shadow
between
us
,
however
slight
,
and
I
had
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
that
it
should
not
be
there
.
If
there
must
be
such
a
shadow
*NL*
anywhere
,
I
would
keep
it
for
the
future
in
my
own
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
by
my
wife
on
the
sofa
,
and
put
the
ear-rings
in
her
ears
;
*NL*
and
then
I
told
her
that
I
feared
we
had
not
been
quite
as
good
company
*NL*
lately
,
as
we
used
to
be
,
and
that
the
fault
was
mine
.
Which
I
sincerely
*NL*
felt
,
and
which
indeed
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
Dora
,
my
life
,
''
I
said
;
``
I
have
been
trying
to
be
wise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
make
me
wise
too
,
''
said
Dora
,
timidly
.
``
Have
n't
you
,
Doady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
assent
to
the
pretty
inquiry
of
the
raised
eyebrows
,
and
kissed
*NL*
the
parted
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
of
not
a
bit
of
use
,
''
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
head
,
until
the
*NL*
ear-rings
rang
again
.
``
You
know
what
a
little
thing
I
am
,
and
what
I
*NL*
wanted
you
to
call
me
from
the
first
.
If
you
ca
n't
do
so
,
I
am
afraid
*NL*
you
'll
never
like
me
.
Are
you
sure
you
do
n't
think
,
sometimes
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
better
to
have
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
what
,
my
dear
?
''
For
she
made
no
effort
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
''
said
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
laughed
,
and
called
herself
by
her
*NL*
favorite
name
of
a
goose
,
and
hid
her
face
on
my
shoulder
in
such
a
*NL*
profusion
of
curls
that
it
was
quite
a
task
to
clear
them
away
and
see
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
think
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
done
nothing
,
than
to
*NL*
have
tried
to
form
my
little
wife
's
mind
?
''
said
I
,
laughing
at
myself
.
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
question
?
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
have
been
trying
?
''
cried
Dora
.
``
Oh
what
a
shocking
*NL*
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
never
try
any
more
,
''
said
I.
``
For
I
love
her
dearly
as
she
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
a
story
--
really
?
''
inquired
Dora
,
creeping
closer
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
seek
to
change
,
''
said
I
,
``
what
has
been
so
precious
to
me
*NL*
for
so
long
!
You
never
can
show
better
than
as
your
own
natural
self
,
my
*NL*
sweet
Dora
;
and
we
'll
try
no
conceited
experiments
,
but
go
back
to
our
*NL*
old
way
,
and
be
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
be
happy
!
''
returned
Dora
.
``
Yes
!
All
day
!
And
you
wo
n't
mind
things
*NL*
going
a
tiny
morsel
wrong
,
sometimes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
I.
``
We
must
do
the
best
we
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wo
n't
tell
me
,
any
more
,
that
we
make
other
people
bad
,
''
coaxed
*NL*
Dora
;
``
will
you
?
Because
you
know
it
's
so
dreadfully
cross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
no
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
for
me
to
be
stupid
than
uncomfortable
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
*NL*
Dora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
to
be
naturally
Dora
than
anything
else
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
world
!
Ah
Doady
,
it
's
a
large
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
turned
her
delighted
bright
eyes
up
to
mine
,
kissed
*NL*
me
,
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
,
and
sprang
away
to
put
on
Jip
's
new
*NL*
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
my
last
attempt
to
make
any
change
in
Dora
.
I
had
been
unhappy
*NL*
in
trying
it
;
I
could
not
endure
my
own
solitary
wisdom
;
I
could
not
*NL*
reconcile
it
with
her
former
appeal
to
me
as
my
child-wife
.
I
resolved
*NL*
to
do
what
I
could
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
to
improve
our
proceedings
myself
;
*NL*
but
,
I
foresaw
that
my
utmost
would
be
very
little
,
or
I
must
degenerate
*NL*
into
the
spider
again
,
and
be
for
ever
lying
in
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
shadow
I
have
mentioned
,
that
was
not
to
be
between
us
any
more
,
*NL*
but
was
to
rest
wholly
on
my
own
heart
?
How
did
that
fall
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
unhappy
feeling
pervaded
my
life
.
It
was
deepened
,
if
it
were
*NL*
changed
at
all
;
but
it
was
as
undefined
as
ever
,
and
addressed
me
like
a
*NL*
strain
of
sorrowful
music
faintly
heard
in
the
night
.
I
loved
my
wife
*NL*
dearly
,
and
I
was
happy
;
but
the
happiness
I
had
vaguely
anticipated
,
*NL*
once
,
was
not
the
happiness
I
enjoyed
,
and
there
was
always
something
*NL*
wanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fulfilment
of
the
compact
I
have
made
with
myself
,
to
reflect
my
mind
*NL*
on
this
paper
,
I
again
examine
it
,
closely
,
and
bring
its
secrets
to
the
*NL*
light
.
What
I
missed
,
I
still
regarded
--
I
always
regarded
--
as
something
*NL*
that
had
been
a
dream
of
my
youthful
fancy
;
that
was
incapable
of
*NL*
realisation
;
that
I
was
now
discovering
to
be
so
,
with
some
natural
*NL*
pain
,
as
all
men
did
.
But
,
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
my
*NL*
wife
could
have
helped
me
more
,
and
shared
the
many
thoughts
in
which
I
*NL*
had
no
partner
;
and
that
this
might
have
been
;
I
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
these
two
irreconcileable
conclusions
:
the
one
,
that
what
I
*NL*
felt
,
was
general
and
unavoidable
;
the
other
,
that
it
was
particular
to
*NL*
me
,
and
might
have
been
different
:
I
balanced
curiously
,
with
no
*NL*
distinct
sense
of
their
opposition
to
each
other
.
When
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
airy
dreams
of
youth
that
are
incapable
of
realisation
,
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
better
state
preceding
manhood
that
I
had
outgrown
;
and
then
the
*NL*
contented
days
with
Agnes
,
in
the
dear
old
house
,
arose
before
me
,
like
*NL*
spectres
of
the
dead
,
that
might
have
some
renewal
in
another
world
,
but
*NL*
never
never
more
could
be
reanimated
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
the
speculation
came
into
my
thoughts
,
what
might
have
*NL*
happened
,
or
what
would
have
happened
,
if
Dora
and
I
had
never
known
*NL*
each
other
?
But
,
she
was
so
incorporated
with
my
existence
,
that
it
was
*NL*
the
idlest
of
all
fancies
,
and
would
soon
rise
out
of
my
reach
and
*NL*
sight
,
like
gossamer
floating
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
always
loved
her
.
What
I
am
describing
,
slumbered
,
and
half
awoke
,
and
*NL*
slept
again
,
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
my
mind
.
There
was
no
evidence
*NL*
of
it
in
me
;
I
know
of
no
influence
it
had
in
anything
I
said
or
did
.
I
*NL*
bore
the
weight
of
all
our
little
cares
,
and
all
my
projects
;
Dora
held
*NL*
the
pens
;
and
we
both
felt
that
our
shares
were
adjusted
as
the
case
*NL*
required
.
She
was
truly
fond
of
me
,
and
proud
of
me
;
and
when
Agnes
*NL*
wrote
a
few
earnest
words
in
her
letters
to
Dora
,
of
the
pride
and
*NL*
interest
with
which
my
old
friends
heard
of
my
growing
reputation
,
and
*NL*
read
my
book
as
if
they
heard
me
speaking
its
contents
,
Dora
read
them
*NL*
out
to
me
with
tears
of
joy
in
her
bright
eyes
,
and
said
I
was
a
dear
*NL*
old
clever
,
famous
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
mistaken
impulse
of
an
undisciplined
heart
.
''
Those
words
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Strong
's
were
constantly
recurring
to
me
,
at
this
time
;
were
almost
*NL*
always
present
to
my
mind
.
I
awoke
with
them
,
often
,
in
the
night
;
I
*NL*
remember
to
have
even
read
them
,
in
dreams
,
inscribed
upon
the
walls
of
*NL*
houses
.
For
I
knew
,
now
,
that
my
own
heart
was
undisciplined
when
it
*NL*
first
loved
Dora
;
and
that
if
it
had
been
disciplined
,
it
never
could
*NL*
have
felt
,
when
we
were
married
,
what
it
had
felt
in
its
secret
*NL*
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
disparity
in
marriage
,
like
unsuitability
of
mind
and
*NL*
purpose
.
''
Those
words
I
remembered
too
.
I
had
endeavoured
to
adapt
Dora
*NL*
to
myself
,
and
found
it
impracticable
.
It
remained
for
me
to
adapt
*NL*
myself
to
Dora
;
to
share
with
her
what
I
could
,
and
be
happy
;
to
bear
on
*NL*
my
own
shoulders
what
I
must
,
and
be
happy
still
.
This
was
the
*NL*
discipline
to
which
I
tried
to
bring
my
heart
,
when
I
began
to
think
.
It
*NL*
made
my
second
year
much
happier
than
my
first
;
and
,
what
was
better
*NL*
still
,
made
Dora
's
life
all
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
that
year
wore
on
,
Dora
was
not
strong
.
I
had
hoped
that
lighter
*NL*
hands
than
mine
would
help
to
mould
her
character
,
and
that
a
baby-smile
*NL*
upon
her
breast
might
change
my
child-wife
to
a
woman
.
It
was
not
to
be
.
*NL*
The
spirit
fluttered
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
its
little
prison
,
*NL*
and
,
unconscious
of
captivity
,
took
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
can
run
about
again
,
as
I
used
to
do
,
aunt
,
''
said
Dora
,
``
I
shall
*NL*
make
Jip
race
.
He
is
getting
quite
slow
and
lazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
,
my
dear
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
quietly
working
by
her
side
,
``
he
has
*NL*
a
worse
disorder
than
that
.
Age
,
Dora
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
is
old
?
''
said
Dora
,
astonished
.
``
Oh
,
how
strange
it
*NL*
seems
that
Jip
should
be
old
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
complaint
we
are
all
liable
to
,
Little
One
,
as
we
get
on
in
*NL*
life
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
cheerfully
;
``
I
do
n't
feel
more
free
from
it
than
I
*NL*
used
to
be
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Jip
,
''
said
Dora
,
looking
at
him
with
compassion
,
``
even
little
Jip
!
*NL*
Oh
,
poor
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
'll
last
a
long
time
yet
,
Blossom
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
patting
*NL*
Dora
on
the
cheek
,
as
she
leaned
out
of
her
couch
to
look
at
Jip
,
who
*NL*
responded
by
standing
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
baulking
himself
in
various
*NL*
asthmatic
attempts
to
scramble
up
by
the
head
and
shoulders
.
``
He
must
*NL*
have
a
piece
of
flannel
in
his
house
this
winter
,
and
I
should
n't
wonder
*NL*
if
he
came
out
quite
fresh
again
,
with
the
flowers
,
in
the
spring
.
Bless
*NL*
the
little
dog
!
''
exclaimed
my
aunt
,
``
if
he
had
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
,
*NL*
and
was
on
the
point
of
losing
'em
all
,
he
'd
bark
at
me
with
his
last
*NL*
breath
,
I
believe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
had
helped
him
up
on
the
sofa
;
where
he
really
was
defying
my
aunt
*NL*
to
such
a
furious
extent
,
that
he
could
n't
keep
straight
,
but
barked
*NL*
himself
sideways
.
The
more
my
aunt
looked
at
him
,
the
more
he
reproached
*NL*
her
;
for
,
she
had
lately
taken
to
spectacles
,
and
for
some
inscrutable
*NL*
reason
he
considered
the
glasses
personal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
made
him
lie
down
by
her
,
with
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
;
and
when
*NL*
he
was
quiet
,
drew
one
of
his
long
ears
through
and
through
her
hand
,
*NL*
repeating
,
thoughtfully
,
``
Even
little
Jip
!
Oh
,
poor
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
lungs
are
good
enough
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
gaily
,
``
and
his
dislikes
are
*NL*
not
at
all
feeble
.
He
has
a
good
many
years
before
him
,
no
doubt
.
But
if
*NL*
you
want
a
dog
to
race
with
,
Little
Blossom
,
he
has
lived
too
well
for
*NL*
that
,
and
I
'll
give
you
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
aunt
,
''
said
Dora
,
faintly
.
``
But
,
do
n't
,
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
taking
off
her
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
have
any
other
dog
but
Jip
,
''
said
Dora
.
``
It
would
be
so
*NL*
unkind
to
Jip
!
Besides
,
I
could
n't
be
such
friends
with
any
other
dog
*NL*
but
Jip
;
because
he
would
n't
have
known
me
before
I
was
married
,
and
*NL*
would
n't
have
barked
at
Doady
when
he
first
came
to
our
house
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
care
for
any
other
dog
but
Jip
,
I
am
afraid
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
patting
her
cheek
again
.
``
You
are
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
offended
,
''
said
Dora
.
``
Are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
sensitive
pet
it
is
!
''
cried
my
aunt
,
bending
over
her
*NL*
affectionately
.
``
To
think
that
I
could
be
offended
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
did
n't
really
think
so
,
''
returned
Dora
;
``
but
I
am
a
little
*NL*
tired
,
and
it
made
me
silly
for
a
moment
--
I
am
always
a
silly
little
*NL*
thing
,
you
know
,
but
it
made
me
more
silly
--
to
talk
about
Jip
.
He
has
*NL*
known
me
in
all
that
has
happened
to
me
,
have
n't
you
,
Jip
?
And
I
*NL*
could
n't
bear
to
slight
him
,
because
he
was
a
little
altered
--
could
I
,
*NL*
Jip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jip
nestled
closer
to
his
mistress
,
and
lazily
licked
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
so
old
,
Jip
,
are
you
,
that
you
'll
leave
your
mistress
yet
,
''
*NL*
said
Dora
.
``
We
may
keep
one
another
company
,
a
little
longer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
pretty
Dora
!
When
she
came
down
to
dinner
on
the
ensuing
Sunday
,
and
*NL*
was
so
glad
to
see
old
Traddles
-LRB-
who
always
dined
with
us
on
Sunday
-RRB-
,
we
*NL*
thought
she
would
be
``
running
about
as
she
used
to
do
,
''
in
a
few
days
.
*NL*
But
they
said
,
wait
a
few
days
more
;
and
then
,
wait
a
few
days
more
;
and
*NL*
still
she
neither
ran
nor
walked
.
She
looked
very
pretty
,
and
was
very
*NL*
merry
;
but
the
little
feet
that
used
to
be
so
nimble
when
they
danced
*NL*
round
Jip
,
were
dull
and
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
carry
her
down
stairs
every
morning
,
and
upstairs
every
*NL*
night
.
She
would
clasp
me
round
the
neck
and
laugh
,
the
while
,
as
if
I
*NL*
did
it
for
a
wager
.
Jip
would
bark
and
caper
round
us
,
and
go
on
before
,
*NL*
and
look
back
on
the
landing
,
breathing
short
,
to
see
that
we
were
*NL*
coming
.
My
aunt
,
the
best
and
most
cheerful
of
nurses
,
would
trudge
*NL*
after
us
,
a
moving
mass
of
shawls
and
pillows
.
Mr.
Dick
would
not
have
*NL*
relinquished
his
post
of
candle-bearer
to
any
one
alive
.
Traddles
would
*NL*
be
often
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
looking
on
,
and
taking
charge
*NL*
of
sportive
messages
from
Dora
to
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
.
We
made
*NL*
quite
a
gay
procession
of
it
,
and
my
child-wife
was
the
gayest
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
sometimes
,
when
I
took
her
up
,
and
felt
that
she
was
lighter
in
my
*NL*
arms
,
a
dead
blank
feeling
came
upon
me
,
as
if
I
were
approaching
to
*NL*
some
frozen
region
yet
unseen
,
that
numbed
my
life
.
I
avoided
the
*NL*
recognition
of
this
feeling
by
any
name
,
or
by
any
communing
with
*NL*
myself
;
until
one
night
,
when
it
was
very
strong
upon
me
,
and
my
aunt
*NL*
had
left
her
with
a
parting
cry
of
``
Good
night
,
Little
Blossom
,
''
I
sat
*NL*
down
at
my
desk
alone
,
and
cried
to
think
,
O
what
a
fatal
name
it
was
,
*NL*
and
how
the
blossom
withered
in
its
bloom
upon
the
tree
!

CHAPTER
XLIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
AM
INVOLVED
IN
MYSTERY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
received
one
morning
by
the
post
,
the
following
letter
,
dated
*NL*
Canterbury
,
and
addressed
to
me
at
Doctors
'
Commons
;
which
I
read
with
*NL*
some
surprise
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAR
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Circumstances
beyond
my
individual
control
have
,
for
a
*NL*
considerable
lapse
of
time
,
effected
a
severance
of
that
intimacy
*NL*
which
,
in
the
limited
opportunities
conceded
to
me
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
my
professional
duties
,
of
contemplating
the
scenes
and
events
*NL*
of
the
past
,
tinged
by
the
prismatic
hues
of
memory
,
has
ever
*NL*
afforded
me
,
as
it
ever
must
continue
to
afford
,
gratifying
*NL*
emotions
of
no
common
description
.
This
fact
,
my
dear
sir
,
*NL*
combined
with
the
distinguished
elevation
to
which
your
talents
*NL*
have
raised
you
,
deters
me
from
presuming
to
aspire
to
the
*NL*
liberty
of
addressing
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
by
the
familiar
*NL*
appellation
of
Copperfield
!
It
is
sufficient
to
know
that
the
name
*NL*
to
which
I
do
myself
the
honor
to
refer
,
will
ever
be
treasured
*NL*
among
the
muniments
of
our
house
-LRB-
I
allude
to
the
archives
*NL*
connected
with
our
former
lodgers
,
preserved
by
Mrs.
Micawber
-RRB-
,
*NL*
with
sentiments
of
personal
esteem
amounting
to
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
for
one
,
situated
,
through
his
original
errors
and
a
*NL*
fortuitous
combination
of
unpropitious
events
,
as
is
the
foundered
*NL*
Bark
-LRB-
if
he
may
be
allowed
to
assume
so
maritime
a
denomination
-RRB-
,
*NL*
who
now
takes
up
the
pen
to
address
you
--
it
is
not
,
I
repeat
,
for
*NL*
one
so
circumstanced
,
to
adopt
the
language
of
compliment
,
or
of
*NL*
congratulation
.
That
,
he
leaves
to
abler
and
to
purer
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
more
important
avocations
should
admit
of
your
ever
*NL*
tracing
these
imperfect
characters
thus
far
--
which
may
be
,
or
may
*NL*
not
be
,
as
circumstances
arise
--
you
will
naturally
inquire
by
what
*NL*
object
am
I
influenced
,
then
,
in
inditing
the
present
missive
?
*NL*
Allow
me
to
say
that
I
fully
defer
to
the
reasonable
character
of
*NL*
that
inquiry
,
and
proceed
to
develope
it
;
premising
that
it
is
*NL*
_
not
_
an
object
of
a
pecuniary
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
more
directly
referring
to
any
latent
ability
that
*NL*
may
possibly
exist
on
my
part
,
of
wielding
the
thunderbolt
,
or
*NL*
directing
the
devouring
and
avenging
flame
in
any
quarter
,
I
may
*NL*
be
permitted
to
observe
,
in
passing
,
that
my
brightest
visions
*NL*
are
for
ever
dispelled
--
that
my
peace
is
shattered
and
my
power
*NL*
of
enjoyment
destroyed
--
that
my
heart
is
no
longer
in
the
right
*NL*
place
--
and
that
I
no
more
walk
erect
before
my
fellow
man
.
The
*NL*
canker
is
in
the
flower
.
The
cup
is
bitter
to
the
brim
.
The
worm
*NL*
is
at
his
work
,
and
will
soon
dispose
of
his
victim
.
The
sooner
*NL*
the
better
.
But
I
will
not
digress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Placed
in
a
mental
position
of
peculiar
painfulness
,
beyond
*NL*
the
assuaging
reach
even
of
Mrs.
Micawber
's
influence
,
though
*NL*
exercised
in
the
tripartite
character
of
woman
,
wife
,
and
mother
,
*NL*
it
is
my
intention
to
fly
from
myself
for
a
short
period
,
and
*NL*
devote
a
respite
of
eight-and-forty
hours
to
revisiting
some
*NL*
metropolitan
scenes
of
past
enjoyment
.
Among
other
havens
of

domestic
tranquillity
and
peace
of
mind
,
my
feet
will
naturally
*NL*
tend
towards
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
.
In
stating
that
I
shall
*NL*
be
-LRB-
D.
V.
-RRB-
on
the
outside
of
the
south
wall
of
that

incarceration
on

process
,
the
day

to-morrow
,
at

seven
in
the
evening

precisely
,
my
object
in
this
epistolary
*NL*
communication
is
accomplished

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

warranted

P.S.
.
It
may
be
advisable
to
superadd
to
the
above
,
the
statement
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Micawber
is
_
not
_
in
confidential
possession
of
my
*NL*
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
the
letter
over
,
several
times
.
Making
due
allowance
for
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
lofty
style
of
composition
,
and
for
the
extraordinary
relish
*NL*
with
which
he
sat
down
and
wrote
long
letters
on
all
possible
and
*NL*
impossible
occasions
,
I
still
believed
that
something
important
lay
*NL*
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
this
roundabout
communication
.
I
put
it
down
,
to
*NL*
think
about
it
;
and
took
it
up
again
,
to
read
it
once
more
;
and
was
*NL*
still
pursuing
it
,
when
Traddles
found
me
in
the
height
of
my
*NL*
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
never
was
better
pleased
to
see
you
.
You
*NL*
come
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
sober
judgment
at
a
most
opportune
*NL*
time
.
I
have
received
a
very
singular
letter
,
Traddles
,
from
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
cried
Traddles
.
``
You
do
n't
say
so
?
And
I
have
received
one
from
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
Traddles
,
who
was
flushed
with
walking
,
and
whose
hair
,
*NL*
under
the
combined
effects
of
exercise
and
excitement
,
stood
on
end
as
*NL*
if
he
saw
a
cheerful
ghost
,
produced
his
letter
and
made
an
exchange
*NL*
with
me
.
I
watched
him
into
the
heart
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
letter
,
and
*NL*
returned
the
elevation
of
eyebrows
with
which
he
said
''
`
Wielding
the
*NL*
thunderbolt
,
or
directing
the
devouring
and
avenging
flame
!
'
Bless
*NL*
me
,
Copperfield
!
''
--
and
then
entered
on
the
perusal
of
Mrs.
Micawber
's
*NL*
epistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
ran
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
best
regards
to
Mr.
Thomas
Traddles
,
and
if
he
should
still
*NL*
remember
one
who
formerly
had
the
happiness
of
being
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
him
,
may
I
beg
a
few
moments
of
his
leisure
time
?
*NL*
I
assure
Mr.
T.
T.
that
I
would
not
intrude
upon
his
kindness
,
*NL*
were
I
in
any
other
position
than
on
the
confines
of
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
harrowing
to
myself
to
mention
,
the
alienation
of
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
-LRB-
formerly
so
domesticated
-RRB-
from
his
wife
and
family
,
is
*NL*
the
cause
of
my
addressing
my
unhappy
appeal
to
Mr.
Traddles
,
*NL*
and
soliciting
his
best
indulgence
.
Mr.
T.
can
form
no
adequate
*NL*
idea
of
the
change
in
Mr.
Micawber
's
conduct
,
of
his
wildness
,
of
*NL*
his
violence
.
It
has
gradually
augmented
,
until
it
assumes
the
*NL*
appearance
of
aberration
of
intellect
.
Scarcely
a
day
passes
,
I
*NL*
assure
Mr.
Traddles
,
on
which
some
paroxysm
does
not
take
place
.
*NL*
Mr.
T.
will
not
require
me
to
depict
my
feelings
,
when
I
inform
*NL*
him
that
I
have
become
accustomed
to
hear
Mr.
Micawber
assert
*NL*
that
he
has
sold
himself
to
the
D.
Mystery
and
secresy
have
long
*NL*
been
his
principal
characteristic
,
have
long
replaced
unlimited
*NL*
confidence
.
The
slightest
provocation
,
even
being
asked
if
there
*NL*
is
anything
he
would
prefer
for
dinner
,
causes
him
to
express
a
*NL*
wish
for
a
separation
.
Last
night
,
on
being
childishly
solicited
*NL*
for
twopence
,
to
buy
`
lemon-stunners
'
--
a
local
sweetmeat
--
he
*NL*
presented
an
oyster-knife
at
the
twins
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entreat
Mr.
Traddles
to
bear
with
me
in
entering
into
these
*NL*
details

Without
them
,
Mr.
T.
would
indeed
find
it
difficult
to
*NL*
form
the
faintest
conception
of
my
heart-rending
situation

*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
now
venture
to
confide
to
Mr.
T.
the
purport
of
my
*NL*
letter

Will
he
now
allow
me
to
throw
myself
on
his
friendly
*NL*
consideration

Oh
yes

I
know
his
heart

his

,
this
morning
before

in

the

direction-card

he
attached

little
brown
valise
of

happier
days

I
fervently

Mr.
T.
to
see
my
*NL*
misguided
husband

and
to
reason
with
him
?
Dare
I
ask
Mr.
T.
to

endeavour
to
step
in
between
Mr.
Micawber
and
his
agonised
family
?
*NL*
Oh
no
,
for
that
would
be
too
much
!

If
Mr.

*NL*
``
What

said
Traddles
,
casting
his
eyes
upon

,
when
I
had
read
it
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think

''
said
I.
For
he
was
still
reading
it
*NL*
with
knitted
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
the
two
together
,

,
''
replied
Traddles
,
*NL*
``
mean
more
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.

correspondence

but
I
do

what
.
They
are
both
written
in
good
*NL*
faith
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
and
without
any
collusion
.
Poor
thing
!
''
he
was
*NL*
now
alluding
to
Mrs.
Micawber
's
letter
,
and
we
were
standing
side
by
*NL*
side
comparing
the
two
;
``
it
will
be
a
charity
to
write
to
her
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
and
tell
her
that
we
will
not
fail
to
see
Mr.
Micawber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
acceded
to
this
,
the
more
readily
,
because
I
now
reproached
myself
*NL*
with
having
treated
her
former
letter
rather
lightly
.
It
had
set
me
*NL*
thinking
a
good
deal
at
the
time
,
as
I
have
mentioned
in
its
place
;
but
*NL*
my
absorption
in
my
own
affairs
,
my
experience
of
the
family
,
and
my
*NL*
hearing
nothing
more
,
had
gradually
ended
in
my
dismissing
the
subject
.
*NL*
I
had
often
thought
of
the
Micawbers
,
but
chiefly
to
wonder
what
*NL*
``
pecuniary
liabilities
''
they
were
establishing
in
Canterbury
,
and
to
*NL*
recall
how
shy
Mr.
Micawber
was
of
me
when
he
became
clerk
to
Uriah
*NL*
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
now
wrote
a
comforting
letter
to
Mrs.
Micawber
,
in
our
joint
*NL*
names
,
and
we
both
signed
it
.
As
we
walked
into
town
to
post
it
,
*NL*
Traddles
and
I
held
a
long
conference
,
and
launched
into
a
number
of
*NL*
speculations
,
which
I
need
not
repeat
.
We
took
my
aunt
into
our
counsels
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
;
but
our
only
decided
conclusion
was
,
that
we
would
be
*NL*
very
punctual
in
keeping
Mr.
Micawber
's
appointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
we
appeared
at
the
stipulated
place
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
*NL*
the
time
,
we
found
Mr.
Micawber
already
there
.
He
was
standing
with
his
*NL*
arms
folded
,
over
against
the
wall
,
looking
at
the
spikes
on
the
top
,
*NL*
with
a
sentimental
expression
,
as
if
they
were
the
interlacing
boughs
of
*NL*
trees
that
had
shaded
him
in
his
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
accosted
him
,
his
manner
was
something
more
confused
,
and
*NL*
something
less
genteel
,
than
of
yore
.
He
had
relinquished
his
legal
suit
*NL*
of
black
for
the
purposes
of
this
excursion
,
and
wore
the
old
surtout
*NL*
and
tights
,
but
not
quite
with
the
old
air
.
He
gradually
picked
up
more
*NL*
and
more
of
it
as
we
conversed
with
him
;
but
,
his
very
eye-glass
seemed
*NL*
to
hang
less
easily
,
and
his
shirt
collar
,
though
still
of
the
old
*NL*
formidable
dimensions
,
rather
drooped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
!
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
after
the
first
salutations
,
``
you
are
*NL*
friends
in
need
,
and
friends
indeed
.
Allow
me
to
offer
my
inquiries
with
*NL*
reference
to
the
physical
welfare
of
Mrs.
Copperfield
_
in
esse
_
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Traddles
_
in
posse
_
,
--
presuming
,
that
is
to
say
,
that
my
friend
Mr.
*NL*
Traddles
is
not
yet
united
to
the
object
of
his
affections
,
for
weal
and
*NL*
for
woe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
acknowledged
his
politeness
,
and
made
suitable
replies
.
He
then
*NL*
directed
our
attention
to
the
wall
,
and
was
beginning
``
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
''
when
I
ventured
to
object
to
that
ceremonious
form
of
*NL*
address
,
and
to
beg
that
he
would
speak
to
us
in
the
old
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
he
returned
,
pressing
my
hand
,
``
your
cordiality
*NL*
overpowers
me
.
This
reception
of
a
shattered
fragment
of
the
Temple
once
*NL*
called
Man
--
if
I
may
be
permitted
so
to
express
myself
--
bespeaks
a
heart
*NL*
that
is
an
honor
to
our
common
nature
.
I
was
about
to
observe
that
I
*NL*
again
behold
the
serene
spot
where
some
of
the
happiest
hours
of
my
*NL*
existence
fleeted
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Made
so
,
I
am
sure
,
by
Mrs.
Micawber
,
''
said
I.
``
I
hope
she
is
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
whose
face
clouded
at
this
*NL*
reference
,
``
she
is
but
so-so
.
And
this
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
nodding
his
*NL*
head
sorrowfully
,
``
is
the
Bench
!
Where
,
for
the
first
time
in
many
*NL*
revolving
years
,
the
overwhelming
pressure
of
pecuniary
liabilities
was
*NL*
not
proclaimed
,
from
day
to
day
,
by
importunate
voices
declining
to
*NL*
vacate
the
passage
;
where
there
was
no
knocker
on
the
door
for
any
*NL*
creditor
to
appeal
to
;
where
personal
service
of
process
was
not
*NL*
required
,
and
detainers
were
merely
lodged
at
the
gate
!
Gentlemen
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
when
the
shadow
of
that
iron-work
on
the
summit
of
the
*NL*
brick
structure
has
been
reflected
on
the
gravel
of
the
Parade
,
I
have
*NL*
seen
my
children
thread
the
mazes
of
the
intricate
pattern
,
avoiding
the
*NL*
dark
marks
.
I
have
been
familiar
with
every
stone
in
the
place
.
If
I
*NL*
betray
weakness
,
you
will
know
how
to
excuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
all
got
on
in
life
since
then
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
bitterly
,
``
when
I
was
an
*NL*
inmate
of
that
retreat
I
could
look
my
fellow-man
in
the
face
,
and
punch
*NL*
his
head
if
he
offended
me
.
My
fellow-man
and
myself
are
no
longer
on
*NL*
those
glorious
terms
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
from
the
building
in
a
downcast
manner
,
Mr.
Micawber
accepted
my
*NL*
proffered
arm
on
one
side
,
and
the
proffered
arm
of
Traddles
on
the
*NL*
other
,
and
walked
away
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
landmarks
,
''
observed
Mr.
Micawber
,
looking
fondly
back
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
,
``
on
the
road
to
the
tomb
,
which
,
but
for
the
impiety
*NL*
of
the
aspiration
,
a
man
would
wish
never
to
have
passed
.
Such
is
the
*NL*
Bench
in
my
chequered
career
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
in
low
spirits
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
sir
,
''
interposed
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
it
is
not
because
you
have
conceived
a
dislike
*NL*
to
the
law
--
for
I
am
a
lawyer
myself
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
answered
not
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
our
friend
Heep
,
Mr.
Micawber
?
''
said
I
,
after
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
bursting
into
a
state
of
*NL*
much
excitement
,
and
turning
pale
,
``
if
you
ask
after
my
employer
as
*NL*
_
your
_
friend
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
if
you
ask
after
him
as
_
my
_
friend
,
I
*NL*
sardonically
smile
at
it
.
In
whatever
capacity
you
ask
after
my
*NL*
employer
,
I
beg
,
without
offence
to
you
,
to
limit
my
reply
to
this
--
that
*NL*
whatever
his
state
of
health
may
be
,
his
appearance
is
foxy
:
not
to
say
*NL*
diabolical
.
You
will
allow
me
,
as
a
private
individual
,
to
decline
*NL*
pursuing
a
subject
which
has
lashed
me
to
the
utmost
verge
of
*NL*
desperation
in
my
professional
capacity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
my
regret
for
having
innocently
touched
upon
a
theme
that
*NL*
roused
him
so
much
.
``
May
I
ask
,
''
said
I
,
``
without
any
hazard
of
*NL*
repeating
the
mistake
,
how
my
old
friends
Mr.
and
Miss
Wickfield
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Wickfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
now
turning
red
,
``
is
,
as
she
always
*NL*
is
,
a
pattern
,
and
a
bright
example
.
My
dear
Copperfield
,
she
is
the
*NL*
only
starry
spot
in
a
miserable
existence
.
My
respect
for
that
young
*NL*
lady
,
my
admiration
of
her
character
,
my
devotion
to
her
for
her
love
*NL*
and
truth
,
and
goodness
!
--
Take
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
down
a
turning
,
*NL*
for
,
upon
my
soul
,
in
my
present
state
of
mind
I
am
not
equal
to
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
wheeled
him
off
into
a
narrow
street
,
where
he
took
out
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
stood
with
his
back
to
a
wall
.
If
I
looked
as
*NL*
gravely
at
him
as
Traddles
did
,
he
must
have
found
our
company
by
no
*NL*
means
inspiriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
fate
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
unfeignedly
sobbing
,
but
doing
even
*NL*
that
,
with
a
shadow
of
the
old
expression
of
doing
something
genteel
;
*NL*
``
it
is
my
fate
,
gentlemen
,
that
the
finer
feelings
of
our
nature
have
*NL*
become
reproaches
to
me
.
My
homage
to
Miss
Wickfield
,
is
a
flight
of
*NL*
arrows
in
my
bosom
.
You
had
better
leave
me
,
if
you
please
,
to
walk
the
*NL*
earth
as
a
vagabond
.
The
worm
will
settle
_
my
_
business
in
double-quick
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
attending
to
this
invocation
,
we
stood
by
,
until
he
put
up
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
,
pulled
up
his
shirt-collar
,
and
,
to
delude
any
*NL*
person
in
the
neighbourhood
who
might
have
been
observing
him
,
hummed
a
*NL*
tune
with
his
hat
very
much
on
one
side
.
I
then
mentioned
--
not
knowing
*NL*
what
might
be
lost
,
if
we
lost
sight
of
him
yet
--
that
it
would
give
me
*NL*
great
pleasure
to
introduce
him
to
my
aunt
,
if
he
would
ride
out
to
*NL*
Highgate
,
where
a
bed
was
at
his
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
make
us
a
glass
of
your
own
punch
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
and
forget
whatever
you
have
on
your
mind
,
in
pleasanter
*NL*
reminiscences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
,
if
confiding
anything
to
friends
will
be
more
likely
to
relieve
*NL*
you
,
you
shall
impart
it
to
us
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
Traddles
,
prudently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
do
with
me
as
you
will
!
I
am
a
*NL*
straw
upon
the
surface
of
the
deep
,
and
am
tossed
in
all
directions
by
*NL*
the
elephants
--
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
should
have
said
the
elements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
on
,
arm-in-arm
,
again
;
found
the
coach
in
the
act
of
starting
;
*NL*
and
arrived
at
Highgate
without
encountering
any
difficulties
by
the
*NL*
way
.
I
was
very
uneasy
and
very
uncertain
in
my
mind
what
to
say
or
do
*NL*
for
the
best
--
so
was
Traddles
,
evidently
.
Mr.
Micawber
was
for
the
most
*NL*
part
plunged
into
deep
gloom
.
He
occasionally
made
an
attempt
to
smarten
*NL*
himself
,
and
hum
the
fag-end
of
a
tune
;
but
his
relapses
into
profound
*NL*
melancholy
were
only
made
the
more
impressive
by
the
mockery
of
a
hat
*NL*
exceedingly
on
one
side
,
and
a
shirt-collar
pulled
up
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
to
my
aunt
's
house
rather
than
to
mine
,
because
of
Dora
's
not
*NL*
being
well
.
My
aunt
presented
herself
on
being
sent
for
,
and
welcomed
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
with
gracious
cordiality
.
Mr.
Micawber
kissed
her
hand
,
*NL*
retired
to
the
window
,
and
pulling
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
had
a
*NL*
mental
wrestle
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
was
at
home
.
He
was
by
nature
so
exceedingly
compassionate
of
*NL*
anyone
who
seemed
to
be
ill
at
ease
,
and
was
so
quick
to
find
any
such
*NL*
person
out
,
that
he
shook
hands
with
Mr.
Micawber
,
at
least
half-a-dozen
*NL*
times
in
five
minutes
.
To
Mr.
Micawber
,
in
his
trouble
,
this
warmth
,
on
*NL*
the
part
of
a
stranger
,
was
so
extremely
touching
,
that
he
could
only
*NL*
say
,
on
the
occasion
of
each
successive
shake
,
``
My
dear
sir
,
you
*NL*
overpower
me
!
''
Which
gratified
Mr.
Dick
so
much
,
that
he
went
at
it
*NL*
again
with
greater
vigor
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
friendliness
of
this
gentleman
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
to
my
aunt
,
``
if
*NL*
you
will
allow
me
,
ma'am
,
to
cull
a
figure
of
speech
from
the
vocabulary
*NL*
of
our
coarser
national
sports
--
floors
me
.
To
a
man
who
is
struggling
*NL*
with
a
complicated
burden
of
perplexity
and
disquiet
,
such
a
reception
*NL*
is
trying
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
Mr.
Dick
,
''
replied
my
aunt
,
proudly
,
``
is
not
a
common
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
convinced
of
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
.
``
My
dear
sir
!
''
for
Mr.
Dick
*NL*
was
shaking
hands
with
him
again
;
``
I
am
deeply
sensible
of
your
*NL*
cordiality
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
find
yourself
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
with
an
anxious
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indifferent
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
keep
up
your
spirits
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
``
and
make
yourself
as
*NL*
comfortable
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
quite
overcome
by
these
friendly
words
,
and
by
finding
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
's
hand
again
within
his
own
.
``
It
has
been
my
lot
,
''
he
observed
,
*NL*
``
to
meet
,
in
the
diversified
panorama
of
human
existence
,
with
an
*NL*
occasional
oasis
,
but
never
with
one
so
green
,
so
gushing
,
as
the
*NL*
present
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
I
should
have
been
amused
by
this
;
but
I
felt
that
we
*NL*
were
all
constrained
and
uneasy
,
and
I
watched
Mr.
Micawber
so
*NL*
anxiously
,
in
his
vacillations
between
an
evident
disposition
to
reveal
*NL*
something
,
and
a
counter-disposition
to
reveal
nothing
,
that
I
was
in
a
*NL*
perfect
fever
.
Traddles
,
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
wide
open
,
and
his
hair
more
emphatically
erect
than
ever
,
stared
by
*NL*
turns
at
the
ground
and
at
Mr.
Micawber
,
without
so
much
as
attempting
*NL*
to
put
in
a
word
.
My
aunt
,
though
I
saw
that
her
shrewdest
observation
*NL*
was
concentrated
on
her
new
guest
,
had
more
useful
possession
of
her
*NL*
wits
than
either
of
us
;
for
she
held
him
in
conversation
,
and
made
it
*NL*
necessary
for
him
to
talk
,
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
very
old
friend
of
my
nephew
's
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam

''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
I
wish
I
had
had
the
honor
of
knowing
*NL*
you
at
an
earlier
period

I
was
not
always
the
wreck
you
at
present
*NL*
behold

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Mrs.
Micawber
and
your
family
are

said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
inclined
his
head
.
``
They
are
as
well

ma'am

''
he
*NL*
desperately
observed
after
a
pause
,
``
as
Aliens
and
Outcasts
can
ever
*NL*
hope
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
you

exclaimed
my
aunt
,
in
her
abrupt
way
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
talking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
subsistence
of
my

returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
trembles
*NL*
in
the
balance

My
employer

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Micawber
provokingly
left
off
;
and
began
to
peel
the
lemons
*NL*
that
had
been
under
my
directions
set
before
him
,
together
with
all
the
*NL*
other
appliances
he
used
in
making
punch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
employer
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Dick
,
jogging
his
arm
as
a
gentle
*NL*
reminder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
you
recall
me
.
I
am
obliged
to
*NL*
you

''
They
shook
hands
again
.
``
My
employer

Mr.

me
*NL*
the

that

in
the
receipt

*NL*
stipendiary
emoluments
appertaining

my
engagement
with

I
should
*NL*
probably
be
a
mountebank
about
the
country
swallowing
a
sword-blade
,
and
*NL*
eating
the
devouring
element
.
For
anything
that
I
can
perceive
to
the
*NL*
contrary
,
it
is
still
probable
that
my
children
may
be
reduced
to
seek
a
*NL*
livelihood
by
personal
contortion
,
while
Mrs.
Micawber
abets
their

unnatural
feats

by
playing
the
barrel-organ

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
a
random
but
expressive
flourish
of
his
knife
,
*NL*
signified
that
these
performances
might
be
expected
to
take
place
after
*NL*
he
was
no
more
;
then
resumed
his
peeling
with
a
desperate
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
leaned
her
elbow
on
the
little
round
table
that
she
usually
kept
*NL*
beside
her
,
and
eyed
him
attentively
.
Notwithstanding
the
aversion
with
*NL*
which
I
regarded
the
idea
of
entrapping
him
into
any
disclosure
he
was
*NL*
not
prepared
to
make
voluntarily
,
I
should
have
taken
him
up
at
this
*NL*
point
,
but
for
the
strange
proceedings
in
which
I
saw
him
engaged
;
*NL*
whereof
his
putting
the
lemon-peel
into
the
kettle
,
the
sugar
into
the
*NL*
snuffer-tray
,
the
spirit
into
the
empty
jug
,
and
confidently
attempting
*NL*
to
pour
boiling
water
out
of
a
candlestick
,
were
among
the
most
*NL*
remarkable
.
I
saw
that
a
crisis
was
at
hand
,
and
it
came
.
He
clattered
*NL*
all
his
means
and
implements
together
,
rose
from
his
chair
,
pulled
out
*NL*
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Copperfield

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
behind
his
handkerchief
,
*NL*
``
this
is

repeated
Mr.

;

all
he
had
reserved

came
breaking
out
of
him
.
``
Good

*NL*
My

clapped
her

we
all
started
up
as
if
we
were

possessed

*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
violently
gesticulating
with
*NL*
his
pocket-handkerchief
,
and
fairly
striking
out
from
time
to
time
with

both
arms

as
if

were
swimming
under
superhuman
difficulties

call
upon

to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
a
man
so
hot
in
my
life
.
I
tried
to
calm
him
,
that
we
might
*NL*
come
to
something
rational
;
but
he
got
hotter
and
hotter
,
and
would
n't

hear
a
word

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
gasping
,
puffing
,
and
sobbing
,
to
that
degree
that
he
was
*NL*
like
a

fighting
with
cold

I
really
had
some
fear
of
Mr.

dying
on

The
manner

he
struggled
through
these
inarticulate
sentences
,

,
*NL*
whenever
he
found
himself
getting

fought
his

on

dashed
at

brought

out

vehemence
little

than
marvellous

was
frightful
;

now

when

sank
into

steaming

looked
at

with
every

no

an
endless

I
would
have
gone

he
waved

off

CHAPTER
L
.
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
PEGGOTTY
'S
DREAM
COMES
TRUE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
some
months
had
passed
,
since
our
interview
on
the
bank
of
*NL*
the
river
with
Martha
.
I
had
never
seen
her
since
,
but
she
had
*NL*
communicated
with
Mr.
Peggotty
on
several
occasions
.
Nothing
had
come
of
*NL*
her
zealous
intervention
;
nor
could
I
infer
,
from
what
he
told
me
,
that
*NL*
any
clue
had
ever
been
obtained
,
for
a
moment
,
to
Emily
's
fate
.
I
*NL*
confess
that
I
began
to
despair
of
her
recovery
,
and
gradually
to
sink
*NL*
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
belief
that
she
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
conviction
remained
unchanged
.
So
far
as
I
know
--
and
I
believe
his
*NL*
honest
heart
was
transparent
to
me
--
he
never
wavered
again
,
in
his
*NL*
solemn
certainty
of
finding
her
.
His
patience
never
tired
.
And
,
although
*NL*
I
trembled
for
the
agony
it
might
one
day
be
to
him
to
have
his
strong
*NL*
assurance
shivered
at
a
blow
,
there
was
something
so
religious
in
it
,
so
*NL*
affectingly
expressive
of
its
anchor
being
in
the
purest
depths
of
his
*NL*
fine
nature
,
that
the
respect
and
honor
in
which
I
held
him
were
exalted
*NL*
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
was
not
a
lazy
trustfulness
that
hoped
,
and
did
no
more
.
He
had
been
*NL*
a
man
of
sturdy
action
all
his
life
,
and
he
knew
that
in
all
things
*NL*
wherein
he
wanted
help
he
must
do
his
own
part
faithfully
,
and
help
*NL*
himself
.
I
have
known
him
set
out
in
the
night
,
on
a
misgiving
that
the
*NL*
light
might
not
be
,
by
some
accident
,
in
the
window
of
the
old
boat
,
and
*NL*
walk
to
Yarmouth
.
I
have
known
him
,
on
reading
something
in
the
*NL*
newspaper
that
might
apply
to
her
,
take
up
his
stick
,
and
go
forth
on
a
*NL*
journey
of
three
or
four
score
miles
.
He
made
his
way
by
sea
to
Naples
,
*NL*
and
back
,
after
hearing
the
narrative
to
which
Miss
Dartle
had
assisted
*NL*
me
.
All
his
journeys
were
ruggedly
performed
;
for
he
was
always
*NL*
steadfast
in
a
purpose
of
saving
money
for
Emily
's
sake
,
when
she
should
*NL*
be
found
.
In
all
this
long
pursuit
,
I
never
heard
him
repine
;
I
never
*NL*
heard
him
say
he
was
fatigued
,
or
out
of
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
had
often
seen
him
since
our
marriage
,
and
was
quite
fond
of
him
.
I
*NL*
fancy
his
figure
before
me
now
,
standing
near
her
sofa
,
with
his
rough
*NL*
cap
in
his
hand
,
and
the
blue
eyes
of
my
child-wife
raised
,
with
a
timid
*NL*
wonder
,
to
his
face
.
Sometimes
of
an
evening
,
about
twilight
,
when
he
*NL*
came
to
talk
with
me
,
I
would
induce
him
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
as
we
slowly
paced
to
and
fro
together
;
and
then
,
the
picture
of
*NL*
his
deserted
home
,
and
the
comfortable
air
it
used
to
have
in
my
*NL*
childish
eyes
of
an
evening
when
the
fire
was
burning
,
and
the
wind
*NL*
moaning
round
it
,
came
most
vividly
into
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
at
this
hour
,
he
told
me
that
he
had
found
Martha
waiting
*NL*
near
his
lodging
on
the
preceding
night
when
he
came
out
,
and
that
she
*NL*
had
asked
him
not
to
leave
London
on
any
account
,
until
he
should
have
*NL*
seen
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
tell
you
why
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
her
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
replied
,
``
but
it
is
but
few
words
as
she
*NL*
ever
says
,
and
she
on
'
y
got
my
promise
and
so
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
say
when
you
might
expect
to
see
her
again
?
''
I
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
returned
,
drawing
his
hand
thoughtfully
down
his
*NL*
face
.
``
I
asked
that
too
;
but
it
was
more
-LRB-
she
said
-RRB-
than
she
could
*NL*
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
long
forborne
to
encourage
him
with
hopes
that
hung
on
threads
,
*NL*
I
made
no
other
comment
on
this
information
than
that
I
supposed
he
*NL*
would
see
her
soon
.
Such
speculations
as
it
engendered
within
me
I
kept
*NL*
to
myself
,
and
those
were
faint
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
walking
alone
in
the
garden
,
one
evening
,
about
a
fortnight
*NL*
afterwards
.
I
remember
that
evening
well
.
It
was
the
second
in
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
week
of
suspense
.
There
had
been
rain
all
day
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
damp
feeling
in
the
air
.
The
leaves
were
thick
upon
the
trees
,
and
*NL*
heavy
with
wet
;
but
the
rain
had
ceased
,
though
the
sky
was
still
dark
;
*NL*
and
the
hopeful
birds
were
singing
cheerfully
.
As
I
walked
to
and
fro
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
the
twilight
began
to
close
around
me
,
their
little
*NL*
voices
were
hushed
;
and
that
peculiar
silence
which
belongs
to
such
an
*NL*
evening
in
the
country
when
the
lightest
trees
are
quite
still
,
save
for
*NL*
the
occasional
droppings
from
their
boughs
,
prevailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
green
perspective
of
trellis-work
and
ivy
at
the
side
*NL*
of
our
cottage
,
through
which
I
could
see
,
from
the
garden
where
I
was
*NL*
walking
,
into
the
road
before
the
house
.
I
happened
to
turn
my
eyes
*NL*
towards
this
place
,
as
I
was
thinking
of
many
things
;
and
I
saw
a
figure
*NL*
beyond
,
dressed
in
a
plain
cloak
.
It
was
bending
eagerly
towards
me
,
and
*NL*
beckoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
!
''
said
I
,
going
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
come
with
me
?
''
she
inquired
,
in
an
agitated
whisper
.
``
I
have
*NL*
been
to
him
,
and
he
is
not
at
home
.
I
wrote
down
where
he
was
to
come
,
*NL*
and
left
it
on
his
table
with
my
own
hand
.
They
said
he
would
not
be
out
*NL*
long
.
I
have
tidings
for
him
.
Can
you
come
directly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
answer
was
,
to
pass
out
at
the
gate
immediately
.
She
made
a
hasty
*NL*
gesture
with
her
hand
,
as
if
to
entreat
my
patience
and
my
silence
,
and
*NL*
turned
towards
London
,
whence
,
as
her
dress
betokened
,
she
had
come
*NL*
expeditiously
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
her
if
that
were
not
our
destination
?
On
her
motioning
Yes
,
with
*NL*
the
same
hasty
gesture
as
before
,
I
stopped
an
empty
coach
that
was
*NL*
coming
by
,
and
we
got
into
it
.
When
I
asked
her
where
the
coachman
was
*NL*
to
drive
,
she
answered
``
Anywhere
near
Golden
Square
!
And
quick
!
''
--
then
*NL*
shrunk
into
a
corner
,
with
one
trembling
hand
before
her
face
,
and
the
*NL*
other
making
the
former
gesture
,
as
if
she
could
not
bear
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
much
disturbed
,
and
dazzled
with
conflicting
gleams
of
hope
and
*NL*
dread
,
I
looked
at
her
for
some
explanation
.
But
,
seeing
how
strongly
*NL*
she
desired
to
remain
quiet
,
and
feeling
that
it
was
my
own
natural
*NL*
inclination
too
,
at
such
a
time
,
I
did
not
attempt
to
break
the
silence
.
*NL*
We
proceeded
without
a
word
being
spoken
.
Sometimes
she
glanced
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
as
though
she
thought
we
were
going
slowly
,
though
indeed
we
*NL*
were
going
fast
;
but
otherwise
remained
exactly
as
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
alighted
at
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
Square
she
had
mentioned
,
*NL*
where
I
directed
the
coach
to
wait
,
not
knowing
but
that
we
might
have
*NL*
some
occasion
for
it
.
She
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
hurried
me
on
to
*NL*
one
of
the
sombre
streets
,
of
which
there
are
several
in
that
part
,
*NL*
where
the
houses
were
once
fair
dwellings
in
the
occupation
of
single
*NL*
families
,
but
have
,
and
had
,
long
degenerated
into
poor
lodgings
let
off
*NL*
in
rooms
.
Entering
at
the
open
door
of
one
of
these
,
and
releasing
my
*NL*
arm
,
she
beckoned
me
to
follow
her
up
the
common
staircase
,
which
was
*NL*
like
a
tributary
channel
to
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
swarmed
with
inmates
.
As
we
went
up
,
doors
of
rooms
were
*NL*
opened
and
people
's
heads
put
out
;
and
we
passed
other
people
on
the
*NL*
stairs
,
who
were
coming
down
.
In
glancing
up
from
the
outside
,
before
we
*NL*
entered
,
I
had
seen
women
and
children
lolling
at
the
windows
over
*NL*
flower-pots
;
and
we
seemed
to
have
attracted
their
curiosity
,
for
these
*NL*
were
principally
the
observers
who
looked
out
of
their
doors
.
It
was
a
*NL*
broad
panelled
staircase
,
with
massive
balustrades
of
some
dark
wood
;
*NL*
cornices
above
the
doors
,
ornamented
with
carved
fruit
and
flowers
;
and
*NL*
broad
seats
in
the
windows
.
But
all
these
tokens
of
past
grandeur
were
*NL*
miserably
decayed
and
dirty
;
rot
,
damp
,
and
age
,
had
weakened
the
*NL*
flooring
,
which
in
many
places
was
unsound
and
even
unsafe
.
Some
*NL*
attempts
had
been
made
,
I
noticed
,
to
infuse
new
blood
into
this
*NL*
dwindling
frame
,
by
repairing
the
costly
old
wood-work
here
and
there
*NL*
with
common
deal
;
but
it
was
like
the
marriage
of
a
reduced
old
noble
to
*NL*
a
plebeian
pauper
,
and
each
party
to
the
ill-assorted
union
shrunk
away
*NL*
from
the
other
.
Several
of
the
back
windows
on
the
staircase
had
been
*NL*
darkened
or
wholly
blocked
up
.
In
those
that
remained
,
there
was
*NL*
scarcely
any
glass
;
and
,
through
the
crumbling
frames
by
which
the
bad
*NL*
air
seemed
always
to
come
in
,
and
never
to
go
out
,
I
saw
,
through
other
*NL*
glassless
windows
,
into
other
houses
in
a
similar
condition
,
and
looked
*NL*
giddily
down
into
a
wretched
yard
which
was
the
common
dust-heap
of
the
*NL*
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
proceeded
to
the
top-story
of
the
house
.
Two
or
three
times
,
by
the
*NL*
way
,
I
thought
I
observed
in
the
indistinct
light
the
skirts
of
a
female
*NL*
figure
going
up
before
us
.
As
we
turned
to
ascend
the
last
flight
of
*NL*
stairs
between
us
and
the
roof
,
we
caught
a
full
view
of
this
figure
*NL*
pausing
for
a
moment
,
at
a
door
.
Then
it
turned
the
handle
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
!
''
said
Martha
,
in
a
whisper
.
``
She
has
gone
into
my
room
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
I
_
knew
her
.
I
had
recognised
her
with
amazement
,
for
Miss
Dartle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was
a
lady
whom
I
had
seen
*NL*
before
,
in
a
few
words
,
to
my
conductress
;
and
had
scarcely
done
so
,
*NL*
when
we
heard
her
voice
in
the
room
,
though
not
,
from
where
we
stood
,
*NL*
what
she
was
saying
.
Martha
,
with
an
astonished
look
,
repeated
her
*NL*
former
action
,
and
softly
led
me
up
the
stairs
;
and
then
,
by
a
little
*NL*
back
door
which
seemed
to
have
no
lock
,
and
which
she
pushed
open
with
a
*NL*
touch
,
into
a
small
empty
garret
with
a
low
sloping
roof
:
little
better
*NL*
than
a
cupboard
.
Between
this
,
and
the
room
she
had
called
hers
,
there
*NL*
was
a
small
door
of
communication
,
standing
partly
open
.
Here
we
*NL*
stopped
,
breathless
with
our
ascent
,
and
she
placed
her
hand
lightly
on
*NL*
my
lips
.
I
could
only
see
,
of
the
room
beyond
,
that
it
was
pretty
large
;
*NL*
that
there
was
a
bed
in
it
;
and
that
there
were
some
common
pictures
of
*NL*
ships
upon
the
walls
.
I
could
not
see
Miss
Dartle
,
or
the
person
whom
we
*NL*
had
heard
her
address
.
Certainly
,
my
companion
could
not
,
for
my
*NL*
position
was
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dead
silence
prevailed
for
some
moments
.
Martha
kept
one
hand
on
my
*NL*
lips
,
and
raised
the
other
in
a
listening
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
matters
little
to
me
her
not
being
at
home
,
''
said
Rosa
Dartle
,
*NL*
haughtily
,
``
I
know
nothing
of
her
.
It
is
you
I
come
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
''
replied
a
soft
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
it
,
a
thrill
went
through
my
frame
.
For
it
was
Emily
's
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Miss
Dartle
,
``
I
have
come
to
look
at
you
.
What
?
You
are
*NL*
not
ashamed
of
the
face
that
has
done
so
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
resolute
and
unrelenting
hatred
of
her
tone
,
its
cold
stern
*NL*
sharpness
,
and
its
mastered
rage
,
presented
her
before
me
,
as
if
I
had
*NL*
seen
her
standing
in
the
light
.
I
saw
the
flashing
black
eyes
,
and
the
*NL*
passion-wasted
figure
;
and
I
saw
the
scar
,
with
its
white
track
cutting
*NL*
through
her
lips
,
quivering
and
throbbing
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
see
,
''
she
said
,
``
James
Steerforth
's
fancy
;
the
girl
who
*NL*
ran
away
with
him
,
and
is
the
town-talk
of
the
commonest
people
of
her
*NL*
native
place
;
the
bold
,
flaunting
,
practised
companion
of
persons
like
*NL*
James
Steerforth
.
I
want
to
know
what
such
a
thing
is
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustle
,
as
if
the
unhappy
girl
,
on
whom
she
heaped
these
*NL*
taunts
,
ran
towards
the
door
,
and
the
speaker
swiftly
interposed
herself
*NL*
before
it
.
It
was
succeeded
by
a
moment
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Miss
Dartle
spoke
again
,
it
was
through
her
set
teeth
,
and
with
a
*NL*
stamp
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
there
!
''
she
said
,
``
or
I
'll
proclaim
you
to
the
house
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
street
!
If
you
try
to
evade
_
me
_
,
I
'll
stop
you
,
if
it
's
by
the
*NL*
hair
,
and
raise
the
very
stones
against
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
frightened
murmur
was
the
only
reply
that
reached
my
ears
.
A
silence
*NL*
succeeded
.
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
Much
as
I
desired
to
put
an
end
to
*NL*
the
interview
,
I
felt
that
I
had
no
right
to
present
myself
;
that
it
was
*NL*
for
Mr.
Peggotty
alone
to
see
her
and
recover
her
.
Would
he
never
come
?
*NL*
I
thought
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
''
said
Rosa
Dartle
,
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
,
``
I
see
her
at
last

*NL*
Why
,

was
a
poor
creature
to
be
taken
by
that
delicate
mock-modesty
,
*NL*
and
that
hanging
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

exclaimed
Emily

Whoever

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

returned
the

fiercely
;
``
what
is
there
in
*NL*
common
between

us

you
think
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

our

said
Emily
,
with
a
burst
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
,

said
Rosa
Dartle
,
``
is
so
strong
a
claim

by
one

infamous

scorn

abhorrence

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
deserved

Emily
,
``

it

dreadful

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dartle
placed
herself
in
a
chair
,
within
view
of
the
door
,
and
*NL*
looked
downward
,
as
if
Emily
were
crouching
on
the
floor
before
her
.
*NL*
Being
now
between
me
and
the
light
,
I
could
see
her
curled
lip
,
and
her
*NL*
cruel
eyes
intently
fixed
on
one
place
,
with
a
greedy
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
what
I
say
!
''
she
said
;
``
and
reserve
your
false
arts
for
your
*NL*
dupes

Do
you
hope
to
move
_
me
_
by

tears

No
more
than
you
could
*NL*
charm
me
by
your
smiles

you
purchased
slave

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
have
some
mercy
on
me

cried
Emily
.
``
Show
me
some
compassion

I
*NL*
shall
die
mad

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
no

said
Rosa
Dartle
,
``

*NL*
``
Oh

there
ever
night

cried
Emily
;
*NL*
and
now
I
could
just
see
her
,
on
her
knees
,
with
her
head
thrown
back
,
*NL*
her
pale
face
looking
upward
,
her
hands
wildly
clasped
and
held
out
,
and
*NL*
her
hair
streaming
about
her
.
``
Has
there

you
never

shown
it

constant

would
*NL*
have
been
angry

me

at

once
in

that

had
*NL*
some

I

none

none

no

She
dropped
on
her
face
,
before
the
imperious
*NL*
figure
in
the
chair
,
with
an
imploring
effort
to
clasp
the
skirt
of
her
*NL*
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
Dartle
sat
looking
down
upon
her
,
as
inflexible
as
a
figure
of
*NL*
brass
.
Her
lips
were
tightly
compressed
,
as
if
she
knew
that
she
*NL*
must
keep
a
strong
constraint
upon
herself
--
I
write
what
I
sincerely
*NL*
believe
--
or
she
would
be
tempted
to
strike
the
beautiful
form
with
*NL*
her
foot
.
I
saw
her
,
distinctly
,
and
the
whole
power
of
her
face
and
*NL*
character
seemed
forced
into
that
expression
.
--
Would
he
Never
come
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
miserable
vanity
of
these
earth-worms
!
''
she
said
,
when
she
had
so
*NL*
far
controlled
the
angry
heavings
of
her
breast
,
that
she
could
trust
*NL*
herself
to
speak
.
''
_
Your

Do
you
imagine
that
I
bestow
a
thought
*NL*
on
it

do
any

that
low

not

handsomely

You
were

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
not

cried
Emily
.
``
Say
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak

''
she
said
,
not
deigning
to
take
any
heed
of
this
appeal
,
*NL*
and
drawing
away
her
dress
from
the
contamination
of
Emily
's
touch
,
*NL*
``
I
speak
of
_
his
_
home

where
I
live

Here

she
said
,
stretching
*NL*
out
her
hand
with
her
contemptuous
laugh
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
*NL*
prostrate
girl
,
``
is
a
worthy
cause
of
division
between
lady-mother

gentleman-son

of
grief
in
a
house

would
n't
have
been
*NL*
admitted
as
a
kitchen-girl
;
of
anger
,
and
repining
,
and
reproach
.
This
*NL*
piece
of
pollution
,
picked
up
from
the
water-side
,
to
be
made
much
of
*NL*
for
an
hour
,
and
then
tossed
back
to
her
original
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no
!
''
cried
Emily
,
clasping
her
hands
together
.
``
When
he
first
came
*NL*
into
my
way

that
the
day

never

met
me
*NL*
being
carried
to
my
grave

I
had
been
brought
up
as
virtuous
as
you

be
the

as
good
a

ever

If
you
live

*NL*
you
know

perhaps
,
what
his
power
with
a
weak

vain
girl
might
be

I
*NL*
do

defend
myself

I

well

he
will
know

comes
to
die

his

is
troubled

*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
Dartle
sprang
up
from
her
seat
;
recoiled
;
and
in
recoiling
struck
*NL*
at
her
,
with
a
face
of
such
malignity
,
so
darkened
and
disfigured
by
*NL*
passion
,
that
I
had
almost
thrown
myself
between
them
.
The
blow
,
which
*NL*
had
no
aim
,
fell
upon
the
air
.
As
she
now
stood
panting
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
with
the
utmost
detestation
that
she
was
capable
of
expressing
,
and
*NL*
trembling
from
head
to
foot
with
rage
and
scorn
,
I
thought
I
had
never
*NL*
seen
such
a
sight
,
and
never
could
see
such
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
love
him
?
_
You
?
_
''
she
cried
,
with
her
clenched
hand
,
quivering
as
*NL*
if
it
only
wanted
a
weapon
to
stab
the
object
of
her
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emily
had
shrunk
out
of
my
view
.
There
was
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
tell
that
to
_
me
_
,
''
she
added
,
``
with
your
shameful
lips
?
Why
do
n't
*NL*
they
whip
these
creatures
!
If
I
could
order
it
to
be
done
,
I
would
have
*NL*
this
girl
whipped
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
she
would
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
I
would
not
have
trusted
her
with
the
*NL*
rack
itself
,
while
that
furious
look
lasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slowly
,
very
slowly
,
broke
into
a
laugh
,
and
pointed
at
Emily
with
*NL*
her
hand
,
as
if
she
were
a
sight
of
shame
for
gods
and
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
She

love

she
said

``
That
carrion

And

tell
me
?
Ha

!
The
liars
that
these
traders
are

*NL*
*NL*
Her
mockery
was
worse
than
her
undisguised
rage
.
Of
the
two
,
I
would
*NL*
have
much
preferred
to
be
the
object
of
the
latter
.
But
,
when
she
*NL*
suffered
it
to
break
loose
,
it
was
only
for
a
moment
.
She
had
chained
it
*NL*
up
again
,
and
however
it
might
tear
her
within
,
she
subdued
it
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
here
,
you
pure
fountain
of
love

''
she
said
,
``
to
see

as
I
began
*NL*
by
telling
you

what
such
a

you

was
curious

I
*NL*
am
satisfied

Also
to
tell
you
,
that
you
had
best
seek
that
home
of
*NL*
yours

with
all
speed

and
hide
your
head
among
those
excellent
people
*NL*
who
are
expecting
you

whom
your
money
will
console

When
it
's
all
*NL*
gone
,
you
can
believe
,
and
trust
,
and
love
again

you
know

I
thought
*NL*
you
a
broken
toy
that
had
lasted
its
time
;
a
worthless
spangle
that
*NL*
was
tarnished
,
and
thrown
away
.
But
,
finding
you
true
gold

a
very
*NL*
lady

an
ill-used
innocent

with
a
fresh
heart
full
of
love

*NL*
trustfulness

which
you
look
like

is
quite
consistent
with
your
*NL*
story

I
have
something
more
to
say

Attend
to
it
;
for
what
I
say
I
'll
*NL*
do

Do
you
hear
me

you
fairy
spirit

What
I
say

I
mean
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
Her
rage
got
the
better
of
her
again
,
for
a
moment
;
but
it
passed
over
*NL*
her
face
like
a
spasm
,
and
left
her
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hide
yourself

''
she
pursued
,
``
if

Let
it

some
obscure

better
still

in
some
*NL*
obscure
death

I
wonder
,
if
your
loving
heart
will
not
break

you
have
*NL*
found
no
way

helping
it
to
be
still

I

sometimes

*NL*
*NL*
A
low
crying
,
on
the
part
of
Emily
,
interrupted
her
here
.
She
stopped
,
*NL*
and
listened
to
it
as
if
it
were
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
of
a
strange
nature
,
perhaps
,
''
Rosa
Dartle
went
on
;
``
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*

I

If

to-morrow

I

There

it

*NL*
Would
he
never

never
come

this

How

I
bear
it

``

exclaimed
the
wretched
Emily
,
in
a
tone
that
might
have
*NL*
touched
the
hardest
heart
,
I
should
have
thought

there
was
no

relenting
in
Rosa
Dartle
's
smile

``
What

shall
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

returned
the

``
Live

die

I
heard
a
distant
foot
upon

I
was
certain

The
foot
upon
the
stairs
came
nearer
--
nearer
--
passed
her
as
she
went
*NL*
down
--
rushed
into
the
room
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fearful
cry
followed
the
word
.
I
paused
a
moment
,
and
looking
in
,
saw
*NL*
him
supporting
her
insensible
figure
in
his
arms
.
He
gazed
for
a
few
*NL*
seconds
in
the
face
;
then
stooped
to
kiss
it
--
oh
,
how
tenderly
!
--
and
*NL*
drew
a
handkerchief
before
it
.

With

he
took
her
up
in

,
with
the
veiled

*NL*
lying
on

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
THE
BEGINNING
OF
A
LONGER
JOURNEY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
of
the
following
day
,
when
,
as
I
was
*NL*
walking
in
my
garden
with
my
aunt
-LRB-
who
took
little
other
exercise
now
,
*NL*
being
so
much
in
attendance
on
my
dear
Dora
-RRB-
,
I
was
told
that
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
desired
to
speak
with
me
.
He
came
into
the
garden
to
meet
me
*NL*
half-way
,
on
my
going
towards
the
gate
;
and
bared
his
head
,
as
it
was
*NL*
always
his
custom
to
do
when
he
saw
my
aunt
,
for
whom
he
had
a
high
*NL*
respect
.
I
had
been
telling
her
all
that
had
happened
over-night
.
*NL*
Without
saying
a
word
,
she
walked
up
with
a
cordial
face
,
shook
hands
*NL*
with
him
,
and
patted
him
on
the
arm
.
It
was
so
expressively
done
,
that
*NL*
she
had
no
need
to
say
a
word
.
Mr.
Peggotty
understood
her
quite
as
well
*NL*
as
if
she
had
said
a
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
in
now
,
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
look
after
little
Blossom
,
*NL*
who
will
be
getting
up
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
along
of
my
being
heer
,
ma'am
,
I
hope
?
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
Unless
*NL*
my
wits
is
gone
a
bahd
's
neezing
''
--
by
which
Mr.
Peggotty
meant
to
say
,
*NL*
bird
's
-
nesting
--
``
this
morning
,
't
is
along
of
me
as
you
're
a
going
to
*NL*
quit
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
something
to
say
,
my
good
friend
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
``
and
will
*NL*
do
better
without
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
your
leave
,
ma'am
,
''
returned
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
I
should
take
it
kind
,
*NL*
pervising
you
doe
n't
mind
my
clicketten
,
if
you
'd
bide
heer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
with
short
good-nature
.
``
Then
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
she
drew
her
arm
through
Mr.
Peggotty
's
,
and
walked
with
him
to
a
*NL*
leafy
little
summer-house
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
where
*NL*
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
,
and
I
beside
her
.
There
was
a
seat
for
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
too
,
but
he
preferred
to
stand
,
leaning
his
hand
on
the
small
*NL*
rustic
table
.
As
he
stood
,
looking
at
his
cap
for
a
little
while
before
*NL*
beginning
to
speak
,
I
could
not
help
observing
what
power
and
force
of
*NL*
character
his
sinewy
hand
expressed
,
and
what
a
good
and
trusty
*NL*
companion
it
was
to
his
honest
brow
and
iron-grey
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
my
dear
child
away
last
night
,
''
Mr.
Peggotty
began
,
as
he
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
to
ours
,
``
to
my
lodging
,
wheer
I
have
a
long
time
been
*NL*
expecting
of
her
and
preparing
fur
her
.
It
was
hours
afore
she
knowed
me
*NL*
right
;
and
when
she
did
,
she
kneeled
down
at
my
feet
,
and
kiender
said
*NL*
to
me
,
as
if
it
was
her
prayers
,
how
it
all
come
to
be
.
You
may
believe
*NL*
me
,
when
I
heerd
her
voice
,
as
I
had
heerd
at
home
so
playful
--
and
see
*NL*
her
humbled
,
as
it
might
be
in
the
dust
our
Saviour
wrote
in
with
his
*NL*
blessed
hand
--
I
felt
a
wownd
go
to
my
`
art
,
in
the
midst
of
all
its
*NL*
thankfulness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
face
,
without
any
pretence
of
concealing
*NL*
why
;
and
then
cleared
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
war
n't
for
long
as
I
felt
that
;
for
she
was
found
.
I
had
on
'
y
to
*NL*
think
as
she
was
found
,
and
it
was
gone
.
I
doe
n't
know
why
I
do
so
much
*NL*
as
mention
of
it
now
,
I
'm
sure
.
I
did
n't
have
it
in
my
mind
a
minute
*NL*
ago
,
to
say
a
word
about
myself
;
but
it
come
up
so
nat
`
ral
,
that
I
*NL*
yielded
to
it
afore
I
was
aweer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
self-denying
soul
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
will
have
your
*NL*
reward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
,
with
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
playing
athwart
his
face
,
*NL*
made
a
surprised
inclination
of
the
head
towards
my
aunt
,
as
an
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
her
good
opinion
;
then
,
took
up
the
thread
he
had
*NL*
relinquished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
Em
`
ly
took
flight
,
''
he
said
,
in
stern
wrath
for
the
moment
,
*NL*
``
from
the
house
wheer
she
was
made
a
pris
`
ner
by
that
theer
spotted
*NL*
snake
as
Mas
'
r
Davy
see
,
--
and
his
story
's
trew
,
and
may
GOD
confound
*NL*
him
!
--
she
took
flight
in
the
night
.
It
was
a
dark
night
,
with
a
many
*NL*
stars
a
shining
.
She
was
wild
.
She
ran
along
the
sea
beach
,
believing
*NL*
the
old
boat
was
theer
;
and
calling
out
to
us
to
turn
away
our
faces
,
*NL*
for
she
was
a
coming
by
.
She
heerd
herself
a
crying
out
,
like
as
if
it
*NL*
was
another
person
;
and
cut
herself
on
them
sharp-pinted
stones
and
*NL*
rocks
,
and
felt
it
no
more
than
if
she
had
been
rock
herself
.
Ever
so
*NL*
fur
she
run
,
and
there
was
fire
afore
her
eyes
,
and
roarings
in
her
*NL*
ears
.
Of
a
sudden
--
or
so
she
thowt
,
you
unnerstand
--
the
day
broke
,
wet
*NL*
and
windy
,
and
she
was
lying
b
`
low
a
heap
of
stone
upon
the
shore
,
and
a
*NL*
woman
was
a
speaking
to
her
,
saying
,
in
the
language
of
that
country
,
*NL*
what
was
it
as
had
gone
so
much
amiss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
everything
he
related
.
It
passed
before
him
,
as
he
spoke
,
so
*NL*
vividly
,
that
,
in
the
intensity
of
his
earnestness
,
he
presented
what
he
*NL*
described
,
to
me
,
with
greater
distinctness
than
I
can
express
.
I
can
*NL*
hardly
believe
,
writing
now
long
afterwards
,
but
that
I
was
actually
*NL*
present
in
these
scenes
;
they
are
impressed
upon
me
with
such
an
*NL*
astonishing
air
of
fidelity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
Em
`
ly
's
eyes
--
which
was
heavy
--
see
this
woman
better
,
''
Mr.
Peggotty
*NL*
went
on
,
``
she
know
'd
as
she
was
one
of
them
as
she
had
often
talked
to
*NL*
on
the
beach
.
Fur
,
though
she
had
run
-LRB-
as
I
have
said
-RRB-
ever
so
fur
in
*NL*
the
night
,
she
had
oftentimes
wandered
long
ways
,
partly
afoot
,
partly
*NL*
in
boats
and
carriages
,
and
know
'd
all
that
country
,
`
long
the
coast
,
*NL*
miles
and
miles
.
She
had
n't
no
children
of
her
own
,
this
woman
,
being
a
*NL*
young
wife
;
but
she
was
a
looking
to
have
one
afore
long
.
And
may
my
*NL*
prayers
go
up
to
Heaven
that
`

be
a
happ

to
her

a

May
it
love

be
dootiful

*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen

said
my
aunt

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
been
summat
timorous
and
down
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
and
had
*NL*
sat
,
at
first

a
little
way
off
,
at
her
spinning

such
work

it
*NL*
was
,
when
Em

talked
to
the
children

But
Em
`

had
took
notice
of
*NL*
her
,
and
had
gone
and
spoke
to
her
;
and
as
the
young
woman
was
partial
*NL*
to
the
children
herself
,
they
had
soon
made
friends

Sermuchser

that

went

she
always
giv

This
was
her
as
*NL*
now
asked
what
it
was
that
had
gone
so
much
amiss
.
Em
`

told
her
,
and
*NL*
she
--
took
her
home
.
She
did
indeed
.
She
took
her
home
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
,
covering
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
more
affected
by
this
act
of
kindness
,
than
I
had
ever
seen
him
*NL*
affected
by
anything
since
the
night
she
went
away
.
My
aunt
and
I
did
*NL*
not
attempt
to
disturb
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
little
cottage
,
you
may
suppose
,
''
he
said
,
presently
,
``
but
*NL*
she
found
space
for
Em
`

in
it
,
--
her
husband
was
away
at
sea

and
*NL*
she
kep
it
secret

and
prevailed
upon
such
neighbours
as
she
had
-LRB-
they
*NL*
was
not
many
near
-RRB-
to
keep
it
secret
too
.
Em
`

was
took
bad
with
*NL*
fever
,
and
,
what
is
very
strange
to
me
is
,
--
maybe
't
is
not
so
strange
*NL*
to
scholars
,
--
the
language
of
that
country
went
out
of
her
head
,
and
*NL*
she
could
only
speak
her
own
,
that
no
one
unnerstood
.
She
recollects
,
*NL*
as
if
she
had
dreamed
it
,
that
she
lay
there
,
always
a
talking
her
own
*NL*
tongue
,
always
believing
as
the
old
boat
was
round
the
next
pint
in
*NL*
the
bay
,
and
begging
and
imploring
of
'em
to
send
theer
and
tell
how
*NL*
she
was
dying
,
and
bring
back
a
message
of
forgiveness
,
if
it
was
on
'
y
*NL*
a
wured
.
A'most
the
whole
time
,
she
thowt
,
--
now
,
that
him
as
I
made
*NL*
mention
on
just
now
was
lurking
for
her
unnerneath
the
winder
:
now
that
*NL*
him
as
had
brought
her
to
this
was
in
the
room
,
--
and
cried
to
the
good
*NL*
young
woman
not
to
give
her
up
,
and
know
'd
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
*NL*
could
n't
unnerstand
,
and
dreaded
that
she
must
be
took
away
.
Likewise
*NL*
the
fire
was
afore
her
eyes
,
and
the
roarings
in
her
ears
;
and
there
*NL*
was
no
to-day
,
nor
yesterday
,
nor
yet
to-morrow
;
but
everything
in
her
*NL*
life
as
ever
had
been
,
or
as
ever
could
be
,
and
everything
as
never
*NL*
had
been
,
and
as
never
could
be
,
was
a
crowding
on
her
all
at
once
,
*NL*
and
nothing
clear
nor
welcome
,
and
yet
she
sang
and
laughed
about
it
!
*NL*
How
long
this
lasted
,
I
doe
n't
know
;
but
then
there
come
a
sleep
;
and
*NL*
in
that
sleep
,
from
being
a
many
times
stronger
than
her
own
self
,
she
*NL*
fell
into
the
weakness
of
the
littlest
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
stopped
,
as
if
for
relief
from
the
terrors
of
his
own
*NL*
description
.
After
being
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
he
pursued
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
pleasant
arternoon
when
she
awoke
;
and
so
quiet
,
that
there
*NL*
war
n't
a
sound
but
the
rippling
of
that
blue
sea
without
a
tide
,
upon
*NL*
the
shore
.
It
was
her
belief
,
at
first
,
that
she
was
at
home
upon
a
*NL*
Sunday
morning
;
but
,
the
vine
leaves
as
she
see
at
the
winder
,
and
the
*NL*
hills
beyond
,
war
n't
home

and
contradicted
of
her
.
Then
,
come
in
her
*NL*
friend
to
watch
alongside
of
her
bed
;
and
then
she
know
'd
as
the
old
*NL*
boat
war
n't
round
that
next
pint
in
the
bay
no
more
,
but
was
fur
off
;
*NL*
and
know
'd
where
she
was
,
and
why
;
and
broke
out
a
crying
on
that
good
*NL*
young
woman
's
bosom
,
wheer
I
hope
her
baby
is
a
lying
now
,
a
cheering
of
*NL*
her
with
its
pretty
eyes
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
speak
of
this
good
friend
of
Emily
's
without
a
flow
of
*NL*
tears
.
It
was
in
vain
to
try
.
He
broke
down
again
,
endeavouring
to
bless
*NL*
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
done
my
Em
`
ly
good

he
resumed
,
after
such
emotion
as
I
could
not
*NL*
behold
without
sharing
in
;
and
as
to
my
aunt
,
she
wept
with
all
her
*NL*
heart
;
``
that
done
Em
`
ly
good
,
and
she
begun
to
mend
.
But
,
the
language
*NL*
of
that
country
was
quite
gone
from
her
,
and
she
was
forced
to
make
*NL*
signs
.
So
she
went
on
,
getting
better
from
day
to
day
,
slow
,
but
sure
,
*NL*
and
trying
to
learn
the
names
of
common
things
--
names
as
she
seemed
*NL*
never
to
have
heerd
in
all
her
life
--
till
one
evening
come
,
when
she
was
*NL*
a
setting
at
her
window
,
looking
at
a
little
girl
at
play
upon
the
*NL*
beach
.
And
of
a
sudden
this
child
held
out
her
hand
,
and
said
,
what
*NL*
would
be
in
English
,
`
Fisherman
's
daughter
,
here
's
a
shell
!
'
--
for
you
*NL*
are
to
unnerstand
that
they
used
at
first
to
call
her
`
Pretty
lady
,
'
as
*NL*
the
general
way
in
that
country
is
,
and
that
she
had
taught
'em
to
call
*NL*
her
`
Fisherman
's
daughter
'
instead
.
The
child
says
of
a
sudden
,
*NL*
`
Fisherman
's
daughter
,
here
's
a
shell
!
'
Then
Em
`
ly
unnerstands
her
;
and
*NL*
she
answers
,
bursting
out
a
crying
;
and
it
all
comes
back
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Em
`

got
strong
again
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
after
another
short
*NL*
interval
of
silence
,
``
she
cast
about
to
leave
that
good
young
creetur
,
*NL*
and
get
to
her
own
country
.
The
husband
was
come
home
,
then
;
and
the
two
*NL*
together
put
her
aboard
a
small
trader
bound
to
Leghorn
,
and
from
that
*NL*
to
France
.
She
had
a
little
money
,
but
it
was
less
than
little
as
they
*NL*
would
take
for
all
they
done
.
I
'm
a
`
most
glad
on
it
,
though
they
was
so
*NL*
poor

What
they
done

is
laid
up

Soon

without

all

she
fled

ceased

his

upon

there

said
he
,
putting
his
hand
in
*NL*
his
breast-pocket
,
and
gravely
taking
out
the
little
paper
bundle
I
*NL*
had
seen
before
,
which
he
unrolled
on
the
table
.
``
Theer

fifty

To

I
wish

the

away

I
've
asked

about

not
saying

have
added

a

Would
you
be
so
kind

*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
me
,
apologetically
for
his
scholarship
,
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
*NL*
observed
me
while
I
looked
it
over
.
It
was
quite
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
taking
it
back
.
``
This

put

up

in

*NL*
price

and
that
I
'm
gone
,
and
past
receiving

it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
that
I
thought
it
would
be
right
to
do
so
--
that
I
was
*NL*
thoroughly
convinced
it
would
be
,
since
he
felt
it
to
be
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
that
theer
was
on

one
thing
furder
,
''
he
proceeded
with
a
grave
*NL*
smile
,
when
he
had
made
up
his
little
bundle
again
,
and
put
it
in
his
*NL*
pocket
;
``
but
theer
was
two

I
war
n't
sure
in
my
mind
,
wen
I
come
out
*NL*
this
morning
,
as
I
could
go
and
break
to
Ham
,
of
my
own
self
,
what
had
*NL*
so
thankfully
happened
.
So
I
writ
a
letter
while
I
was
out
,
and
put
it
*NL*
in
the
post-office
,
telling
of
'em
how
all
was
as
't
is
;
and
that
I
*NL*
should
come
down
to-morrow
to
unload
my
mind
of
what
little
needs
a
*NL*
doing
of
down
theer
,
and
,
most-like
,
take
my
farewell
leave
of
*NL*
Yarmouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
wish
me
to
go
with

said
I
,
seeing
that
he
left
*NL*
something
unsaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
could
do
me
that
kind
favor

he
replied
,
``

*NL*
the
sight

cheer

up
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
little
Dora
being
in
good
spirits
,
and
very
desirous
that
I
should
*NL*
go
--
as
I
found
on
talking
it
over
with
her
--
I
readily
pledged
myself
to
*NL*
accompany
him
in
accordance
with
his
wish
.
Next
morning
,
consequently
,
*NL*
we
were
on
the
Yarmouth
coach
,
and
again
travelling
over
the
old
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
passed
along
the
familiar
street
at
night
--
Mr.
Peggotty
,
in
*NL*
despite
of
all
my
remonstrances
,
carrying
my
bag
--
I
glanced
into
Omer
*NL*
and
Joram
's
shop
,
and
saw
my
old
friend
Mr.
Omer
there
,
smoking
his
*NL*
pipe
.
I
felt
reluctant
to
be
present
,
when
Mr.
Peggotty
first
met
his
*NL*
sister
and
Ham
;
and
made
Mr.
Omer
my
excuse
for
lingering
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Mr.
Omer
,
after
this
long
time
?
''
said
I
,
going
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fanned
away
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
,
that
he
might
get
a
better
view
of
*NL*
me
,
and
soon
recognised
me
with
great
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
get
up
,
sir
,
to
acknowledge
such
an
honor
as
this
visit
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
only
my
limbs
are
rather
out
of
sorts
,
and
I
am
wheeled
about
.
With
*NL*
the
exception
of
my
limbs
and
my
breath
,
hows
`
ever
,
I
am
as
hearty
as
a
*NL*
man
can
be
,
I
'm
thankful
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
congratulated
him
on
his
contented
looks
and
his
good
spirits
,
and
*NL*
saw
,
now
,
that
his
easy
chair
went
on
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
ingenious
thing
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
he
inquired
,
following
the
*NL*
direction
of
my
glance
,
and
polishing
the
elbow
with
his
arm
.
``
It
runs
*NL*
as
light
as
a
feather

tracks
as
true
as

my
*NL*
little
Minnie

my
grand-daughter

know

Minnie

child

puts
her
*NL*
little
strength
against
the
back

gives
it
a
shove
,
and
away
we
go
,
as
*NL*
clever
and
merry
as
ever
you
see
anything
!
And
I
tell
you
what
--
it
's
a
*NL*
most
uncommon
chair
to
smoke
a
pipe
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
such
a
good
old
fellow
to
make
the
best
of
a
thing
,
and
find
*NL*
out
the
enjoyment
of
it
,
as
Mr.
Omer
.
He
was
as
radiant
,
as
if
his
*NL*
chair
,
his
asthma
,
and
the
failure
of
his
limbs
,
were
the
various
*NL*
branches
of
a
great
invention
for
enhancing
the
luxury
of
a
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
more
of
the
world
,
I
can
assure
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
``
in
this
*NL*
chair
,
than
ever
I
see
out
of
it
.
You
'd
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
*NL*
people
that
looks
in
of
a
day
to
have
a
chat
.
You
really
would
!
There
's
*NL*
twice
as
much
in
the
newspaper
,
since
I
've
taken
to
this
chair

there
*NL*
used
to
be

As

reading

what
a

of
it
I
do
get
*NL*
through

That
's
what
I
feel
so
strong

know

If

had
been
my

*NL*
what
should
I
have
done

If

had
been
my
ears

what
should
I
have
*NL*
done

Being
my
limbs

what
does
it
signify
?
Why
,
my
limbs
only
made
my
*NL*
breath
shorter
when
I
used
'em
.
And
now
,
if
I
want
to
go
out
into
the
*NL*
street

down
to
the
sands

I
've
only
got
to
call
Dick

Joram
's
*NL*
youngest

prentice
,

away
I
go
in
my
own
carriage
,
like
the
Lord
*NL*
Mayor
of
London

*NL*
*NL*
He
half
suffocated
himself
with
laughing
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
you
!
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
resuming
his
pipe
,
``
a
man
must
take
the
*NL*
fat
with

that

*NL*
*NL*

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
His
supreme
contempt
for
his
own
limbs
,
as
he
sat
smoking
,
was
one
of
*NL*
the
pleasantest
oddities
I
have
ever
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
surveying
me
admiringly
.
``
What
a
lovely
work

that
was

*NL*
*NL*
I
laughingly
expressed
my
satisfaction
,
but
I
must
confess
that
I
*NL*
thought
this
association
of
ideas
significant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
I
changed
the
subject
by
referring
to
Emily
.
After
assuring
him
that
I
*NL*
did
not
forget
how
interested
he
had
always
been
in
her
,
and
how
kindly
*NL*
he
had
always
treated
her

I
gave
him
a
general
account
of
her
*NL*
restoration
to
her
uncle
by
the
aid
of
Martha
;
which
I
knew
would
please
*NL*
the
old
man

He
listened
with
the
utmost
attention
,

said
,
feelingly
,
*NL*
when
I
had
done
:
*NL*
*NL*

I
,

Mr.

I
have
a
delicacy

so

*NL*
``
Because

up

off

will

knocked

put

hid

against
the
back
of
Mr.
Omer
's
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
elephant
butts
,
you
know
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Omer
,
winking
,
``
when
he
*NL*
goes
at
a
object
.
Once
,
elephant
.
Twice
.
Three
times
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
signal
,
the
little
elephant
,
with
a
dexterity
that
was
next
to
*NL*
marvellous
in
so
small
an
animal
,
whisked
the
chair
round
with
Mr.
Omer
*NL*
in
it
,
and
rattled
it
off
,
pell-mell
,
into
the
parlor
,
without
touching
*NL*
the
doorpost
:
Mr.
Omer
indescribably
enjoying
the
performance
,
and
*NL*
looking
back
at
me
on
the
road
as
if
it
were
the
triumphant
issue
of
his
*NL*
life
's
exertions
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
stroll
about
the
town
,
I
went
to
Ham
's
house
.
Peggotty
had
now
*NL*
removed
here
for
good
;
and
had
let
her
own
house
to
the
successor
of
Mr.
*NL*
Barkis
in
the
carrying
business
,
who
had
paid
her
very
well
for
the
*NL*
good-will
,
cart
,
and
horse
.
I
believe
the
very
same
slow
horse
that
Mr.
*NL*
Barkis
drove
,
was
still
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
them
in
the
neat
kitchen
,
accompanied
by
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
who
had
*NL*
been
fetched
from
the
old
boat
by
Mr.
Peggotty
himself
.
I
doubt
if
she
*NL*
could
have
been
induced
to
desert
her
post
,
by
any
one
else
.
He
had
*NL*
evidently
told
them
all
.
Both
Peggotty
and
Mrs.
Gummidge
had
their
*NL*
aprons
to
their
eyes
,
and
Ham
had
just
stepped
out
``
to
take
a
turn
on
*NL*
the
beach
.
''
He
presently
came
home
,
very
glad
to
see
me
;
and
I
hope
they
*NL*
were
all
the
better
for
my
being
there
.
We
spoke
,
with
some
approach
to
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
of
Mr.
Peggotty
's
growing
rich
in
a
new
country
,
and
of
*NL*
the
wonders
he
would
describe
in
his
letters
.
We
said
nothing
of
Emily
*NL*
by
name
,
but
distantly
referred
to
her
more
than
once
.
Ham
was
the
*NL*
serenest
of
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
Peggotty
told
me
,
when
she
lighted
me
to
a
little
chamber
where
the
*NL*
Crocodile
book
was
lying
ready
for
me
on
the
table
,
that
he
always
was
*NL*
the
same
.
She
believed
-LRB-
she
told
me
,
crying
-RRB-
that
he
was
broken-hearted
;
*NL*
though
he
was
as
full
of
courage
as
of
sweetness
,
and
worked
harder
and
*NL*
better
than
any
boat-builder
in
any
yard
in
all
that
part
.
There
were
*NL*
times
,
she
said
,
of
an
evening
,
when
he
talked
of
their
old
life
in
the
*NL*
boat-house
;
and
then
he
mentioned
Emily
as
a
child
.
But
,
he
never
*NL*
mentioned
her
as
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
read
in
his
face
that
he
would
like
to
speak
to
me
*NL*
alone
.
I
therefore
resolved
to
put
myself
in
his
way
next
evening
,
as
he
*NL*
came
home
from
his
work
.
Having
settled
this
with
myself
,
I
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
That
night
,
for
the
first
time
in
all
those
many
nights
,
the
candle
was
*NL*
taken
out
of
the
window
,
Mr.
Peggotty
swung
in
his
old
hammock
in
the
*NL*
old
boat
,
and
the
wind
murmured
with
the
old
sound
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
next
day
,
he
was
occupied
in
disposing
of
his
fishing-boat
and
*NL*
tackle
;
in
packing
up
,
and
sending
to
London
by
waggon
,
such
of
his
*NL*
little
domestic
possessions
as
he
thought
would
be
useful
to
him
;
and
in
*NL*
parting
with
the
rest
,
or
bestowing
them
on
Mrs.
Gummidge
.
She
was
with
*NL*
him
all
day
.
As
I
had
a
sorrowful
wish
to
see
the
old
place
once
more
,
*NL*
before
it
was
locked
up
,
I
engaged
to
meet
them
there
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
But
I
so
arranged
it
,
as
that
I
should
meet
Ham
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
come
in
his
way
,
as
I
knew
where
he
worked
.
I
met
him
at
*NL*
a
retired
part
of
the
sands
,
which
I
knew
he
would
cross
,
and
turned
*NL*
back
with
him
,
that
he
might
have
leisure
to
speak
to
me
if
he
really
*NL*
wished
.
I
had
not
mistaken
the
expression
of
his
face
.
We
had
walked
but
*NL*
a
little
way
together
,
when
he
said
,
without
looking
at
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
have
you
seen
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
a
moment
,
when
she
was
in
a
swoon
,
''
I
softly
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
a
little
farther
,
and
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
shall
you
see
her
,
d'
ye
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
too
painful
to
her
,
perhaps
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thowt
of
that
,
''
he
replied
.
``
So
`
twould
,
sir
,
so
`
twould
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Ham
,
''
said
I
,
gently
,
``
if
there
is
anything
that
I
could
write
to
*NL*
her
,
for
you
,
in
case
I
could
not
tell
it
;
if
there
is
anything
you
*NL*
would
wish
to
make
known
to
her
through
me
;
I
should
consider
it
a
*NL*
sacred
trust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
o
n't
.
I
thankee
,
sir
,
most
kind
!
I
think
theer
is
something
I
*NL*
could
wish
said
or
wrote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
a
little
farther
in
silence
,
and
then
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ta
n't
that
I
forgive
her
.
`
Ta
n't
that
so
much
.
'T
is
more
as
I
beg
of
*NL*
her
to
forgive
me
,
for
having
pressed
my
affections
upon
her
.
Odd
times
,
*NL*
I
think
that
if
I
had
n't
had
her
promise
fur
to
marry
me
,
sir
,
she
was
*NL*
that
trustful
of
me
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
that
she
'd
have
told
me
what
was
*NL*
struggling
in
her
mind
,
and
would
have
counselled
with
me
,
and
I
might
*NL*
have
saved
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
pressed
his
hand
.
``
Is
that
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Theer
's
yet
a
something
else
,
''
he
returned
,
``
if
I
can
say
it
,
Mas
'
r
*NL*
Davy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
on
,
farther
than
we
had
walked
yet
,
before
he
spoke
again
.
He
*NL*
was
not
crying
when
he
made
the
pauses
I
shall
express
by
lines
.
He
was
*NL*
merely
collecting
himself
to
speak
very
plainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loved
her
--
and
I
love
the
mem
`
ry
of
her
--
too
deep
--
to
be
able
to
*NL*
lead
her
to
believe
of
my
own
self
as
I
'm
a
happy
man
.
I
could
only
be
*NL*
happy
--
by
forgetting
of
her
--
and
I
'm
afeerd
I
could
n't
hardly
bear
as
*NL*
she
should
be
told
I
done
that
.
But
if
you
,
being
so
full
of
learning
,
*NL*
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
could
think
of
anything
to
say
as
might
bring
her
to
*NL*
believe
I
was
n't
greatly
hurt
:
still
loving
of
her
,
and
mourning
for
*NL*
her
:
anything
as
might
bring
her
to
believe
as
I
was
not
tired
of
my
*NL*
life
,
and
yet
was
hoping
fur
to
see
her
without
blame
,
wheer
the
wicked
*NL*
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
--
anything
as
would
ease
*NL*
her
sorrowful
mind
,
and
yet
not
make
her
think
as
I
could
ever
marry
,
*NL*
or
as
't
was
possible
that
any
one
could
ever
be
to
me
what
she
was
--
I
*NL*
should
ask
of
you
to
say
that
--
with
my
prayers
for
her
--
that
was
so
*NL*
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
pressed
his
manly
hand
again
,
and
told
him
I
would
charge
myself
to
do
*NL*
this
as
well
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thankee
,
sir
,
''
he
answered
.
''
'T
was
kind
of
you
to
meet
me
.
'T
was
kind
*NL*
of
you
to
bear
him
company
down
.
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
I
unnerstan
'
very
well
,
*NL*
though
my
aunt
will
come
to
Lon
`
on
afore
they
sail
,
and
they
'll
unite
*NL*
once
more
,
that
I
am
not
like
to
see
him
agen
.
I
fare
to
feel
sure
o
n't
.
*NL*
We
doe
n't
say
so
,
but
so
`
twill
be
,
and
better
so
.
The
last
you
see
on
*NL*
him
--
the
very
last
--
will
you
give
him
the
lovingest
duty
and
thanks
of
*NL*
the
orphan
,
as
he
was
ever
more
than
a
father
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
also
promised
,
faithfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thankee
again
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
heartily
shaking
hands
.
``
I
know
wheer
*NL*
you
're
a
going
.
Good
bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
,
as
though
to
explain
to
me
that
he
could
*NL*
not
enter
the
old
place
,
he
turned
away
.
As
I
looked
after
his
figure
,
*NL*
crossing
the
waste
in
the
moonlight
,
I
saw
him
turn
his
face
towards
a
*NL*
strip
of
silvery
light
upon
the
sea
,
and
pass
on
,
looking
at
it
,
until
*NL*
he
was
a
shadow
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
boat-house
stood
open
when
I
approached
;
and
,
on
*NL*
entering
,
I
found
it
emptied
of
all
its
furniture
,
saving
one
of
the
old
*NL*
lockers
,
on
which
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
with
a
basket
on
her
knee
,
was
seated
,
*NL*
looking
at
Mr.
Peggotty
.
He
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
rough
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
and
gazed
upon
a
few
expiring
embers
in
the
grate
;
but
he
raised
his
*NL*
head
,
hopefully
,
on
my
coming
in
,
and
spoke
in
a
cheery
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
according
to
promise
,
to
bid
farewell
to
`
t
,
eh
,
Mas
'
r
Davy

''
he
*NL*
said
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
``
Bare
enough
now
,
a
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
have
made
good
use
of
the
time

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
we
have
not
been
idle

''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
*NL*
looking
at
her
,
at
a
loss
for
a
sufficiently-approving
simile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
leaning
on
her
basket
,
made
no
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Theer
's
the
very
locker
that
you
used
to
sit
on
,
`
long

*NL*
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
in
a
whisper
.
``
I
'm
a
going
to
carry
it
away
with

*NL*

And

A'most

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
,
the
wind
,
though
it
was
low
,
had
a
solemn
sound
,
and
crept
*NL*
around
the
deserted
house
with
a
whispered
wailing
that
was
very
*NL*
mournful
.
Everything
was
gone
,
down
to
the
little
mirror
with
the
*NL*
oyster-shell
frame
.
I
thought
of
myself
,
lying
here
,
when
that
first
*NL*
great
change
was
being
wrought
at
home
.
I
thought
of
the
blue-eyed
child
*NL*
who
had
enchanted
me
.
I
thought
of
Steerforth
:
and
a
foolish
,
fearful
*NL*
fancy
came
upon
me
of
his
being
near
at
hand
,
and
liable
to
be
met
at
*NL*
any
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
like
to
be
long
,
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
afore
the
*NL*
boat
finds
new
tenants
.
They
look
upon

unfort

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
belong
to
anybody
in
the
neighbourhood
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

mast-maker
up
town

said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
I
'm
a
going
to
give
the
*NL*
key
to
him
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
into
the
other
little
room
,
and
came
back
to
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
*NL*
sitting
on
the
locker
,
whom
Mr.
Peggotty
,
putting
the
light
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
requested
to
rise
,
that
he
might
carry
it
outside
the
*NL*
door
before
extinguishing
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dan

said
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
suddenly
deserting
her
basket
,
and
clinging
*NL*
to
his
arm
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
,
taken
aback
,
looked
from
Mrs.
Gummidge
to
me
,
and
from
me
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
as
if
he
had
been
awakened
from

*NL*
``

his

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
And
Mrs.

took
his
hand
,
and
kissed
it
with
a
homely
pathos
and
*NL*
affection
,
in
a
homely
rapture
of
devotion

gratitude

that
he
well

*NL*
We
brought
the

out

extinguished

fastened

the

left
the

shut
up

Next

when

outside

Mrs.

CHAPTER
LII
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ASSIST
AT
AN
EXPLOSION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
time
Mr.
Micawber
had
appointed
so
mysteriously
,
was
within
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
of
being
come
,
my
aunt
and
I
consulted
how
we
*NL*
should
proceed
;
for
my
aunt
was
very
unwilling
to
leave
Dora
.
Ah
!
how
*NL*
easily
I
carried
Dora
up
and
down
stairs
,
now
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
disposed
,
notwithstanding
Mr.
Micawber
's
stipulation
for
my
*NL*
aunt
's
attendance
,
to
arrange
that
she
should
stay
at
home
,
and
be
*NL*
represented
by
Mr.
Dick
and
me
.
In
short
,
we
had
resolved
to
take
this
*NL*
course
,
when
Dora
again
unsettled
us
by
declaring
that
she
never
would
*NL*
forgive
herself
,
and
never
would
forgive
her
bad
boy
,
if
my
aunt
*NL*
remained
behind
,
on
any
pretence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
speak
to
you
,
''
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
curls
at
my
aunt
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
be
disagreeable
!
I
'll
make
Jip
bark
at
you
all
day
.
I
shall
be
sure
that
*NL*
you
really
are
a
cross
old
thing
,
if
you
do
n't
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
Blossom
!
''
laughed
my
aunt
.
``
You
know
you
ca
n't
do
without
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
,
''
said
Dora
.
``
You
are
no
use
to
me
at
all
.
You
never
run
up
*NL*
and
down
stairs
for
me
,
all
day
long
.
You
never
sit
and
tell
me
stories
*NL*
about
Doady
,
when
his
shoes
were
worn
out
,
and
he
was
covered
with
*NL*
dust
--
oh
,
what
a
poor
little
mite
of
a
fellow
!
You
never
do
anything
*NL*
at
all
to
please
me
,
do
you
,
dear
?
''
Dora
made
haste
to
kiss
my
aunt
,
*NL*
and
say
,
``
Yes
,
you
do
!
I
'm
only
joking
!
''
--
lest
my
aunt
should
think
she
*NL*
really
meant
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
aunt
,
''
said
Dora
,
coaxingly
,
``
now
listen
.
You
must
go
.
I
shall
*NL*
tease
you
,
'till
you
let
me
have
my
own
way
about
it
.
I
shall
lead
my
*NL*
naughty
boy
_
such
_
a
life
,
if
he
do
n't
make
you
go
.
I
shall
make
myself
*NL*
_
so
_
disagreeable
--
and
so
will
Jip
!
You
'll
wish
you
had
gone
,
like
a
*NL*
good
thing
,
for
ever
and
ever
so
long
,
if
you
do
n't
go
.
Besides
,
''
said
*NL*
Dora
,
putting
back
her
hair
,
and
looking
wonderingly
at
my
aunt
and
me
,
*NL*
``
why
should
n't
you
both
go
?
I
am
not
very
ill
indeed
.
Am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
question
!
''
cried
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fancy
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
I
know
I
am
a
silly
little
thing
!
''
said
Dora
,
slowly
looking
from
*NL*
one
of
us
to
the
other
,
and
then
putting
up
her
pretty
lips
to
kiss
us
*NL*
as
she
lay
upon
her
couch
.
``
Well
,
then
,
you
must
both
go
,
or
I
shall
not
*NL*
believe
you
;
and
then
I
shall
cry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
,
in
my
aunt
's
face
,
that
she
began
to
give
way
now
,
and
Dora
*NL*
brightened
again
,
as
she
saw
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
come
back
with
so
much
to
tell
me
,
that
it
'll
take
at
least
a
*NL*
week
to
make
me
understand
!
''
said
Dora
.
``
Because
I
_
know
_
I
sha
'n'
t
*NL*
understand
,
for
a
length
of
time
,
if
there
's
any
business
in
it
.
And
*NL*
there
's
sure
to
be
some
business
in
it
!
If
there
's
any
thing
to
add
up
,
*NL*
besides
,
I
do
n't
know
when
I
shall
make
it
out
;
and
my
bad
boy
will
look
*NL*
_
so
_
miserable
all
the
time
.
There
!
Now
you
'll
go
,
wo
n't
you
?
You
'll
*NL*
only
be
gone
one
night
,
and
Jip
will
take
care
of
me
while
you
are
gone
.
*NL*
Doady
will
carry
me
up
stairs
before
you
go
,
and
I
wo
n't
come
down
again
*NL*
till
you
come
back
;
and
you
shall
take
Agnes
a
dreadfully
scolding
*NL*
letter
from
me
,
because
she
has
never
been
to
see
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
agreed
,
without
any
more
consultation
,
that
we
would
both
go
,
and
*NL*
that
Dora
was
a
little
Impostor
,
who
feigned
to
be
rather
unwell
,
*NL*
because
she
liked
to
be
petted
.
She
was
greatly
pleased
,
and
very
merry
;
*NL*
and
we
four
,
that
is
to
say
,
my
aunt
,
Mr.
Dick
,
Traddles
,
and
I
,
went
*NL*
down
to
Canterbury
by
the
Dover
mail
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hotel
where
Mr.
Micawber
had
requested
us
to
await
him
,
which
we
*NL*
got
into
,
with
some
trouble
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
found
a
*NL*
letter
,
importing
that
he
would
appear
in
the
morning
punctually
at
*NL*
half-past
nine
.
After
which
,
we
went
shivering
,
at
that
uncomfortable
*NL*
hour
,
to
our
respective
beds
,
through
various
close
passages
;
which
*NL*
smelt
as
if
they
had
been
steeped
,
for
ages
,
in
a
solution
of
soup
and
*NL*
stables
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
,
I
sauntered
through
the
dear
old
tranquil
streets
,
*NL*
and
again
mingled
with
the
shadows
of
the
venerable
gateways
and
*NL*
churches
.
The
rooks
were
sailing
about
the
cathedral
towers
;
and
the
*NL*
towers
themselves
,
overlooking
many
a
long
unaltered
mile
of
the
rich
*NL*
country
and
its
pleasant
streams
,
were
cutting
the
bright
morning
air
,
*NL*
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
change
on
earth
.
Yet
the
bells
,
when
*NL*
they
sounded
,
told
me
sorrowfully
of
change
in
everything
;
told
me
of
*NL*
their
own
age
,
and
my
pretty
Dora
's
youth
;
and
of
the
many
,
never
old
,
*NL*
who
had
lived
and
loved
and
died
,
while
the
reverberations
of
the
bells
*NL*
had
hummed
through
the
rusty
armour
of
the
Black
Prince
hanging
up
*NL*
within
,
and
,
motes
upon
the
deep
of
Time
,
had
lost
themselves
in
air
,
as
*NL*
circles
do
in
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
the
old
house
from
the
corner
of
the
street
,
but
did
not
go
*NL*
nearer
to
it
,
lest
,
being
observed
,
I
might
unwittingly
do
any
harm
to
*NL*
the
design
I
had
come
to
aid
.
The
early
sun
was
striking
edgewise
on
its
*NL*
gables
and
lattice-windows
,
touching
them
with
gold
;
and
some
beams
of
*NL*
its
old
peace
seemed
to
touch
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
strolled
into
the
country
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
returned
by
the
*NL*
main
street
,
which
in
the
interval
had
shaken
off
its
last
night
's
*NL*
sleep
.
Among
those
who
were
stirring
in
the
shops
,
I
saw
my
ancient
*NL*
enemy
the
butcher
,
now
advanced
to
top-boots
and
a
baby
,
and
in
business
*NL*
for
himself
.
He
was
nursing
the
baby
,
and
appeared
to
be
a
benignant
*NL*
member
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
became
very
anxious
and
impatient
,
when
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
As
it
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
half-past
nine
o'clock
,
our
*NL*
restless
expectation
of
Mr.
Micawber
increased
.
At
last
we
made
no
more
*NL*
pretence
of
attending
to
the
meal
,
which
,
except
with
Mr.
Dick
,
had
been
*NL*
a
mere
form
from
the
first
;
but
my
aunt
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
Traddles
sat
upon
the
sofa
affecting
to
read
the
paper
with
his
eyes
on
*NL*
the
ceiling
;
and
I
looked
out
of
the
window
to
give
early
notice
of
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
coming
.
Nor
had
I
long
to
watch
,
for
,
at
the
first
chime
of
*NL*
the
half
hour
,
he
appeared
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
not
in
his
legal
attire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
tied
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
-LRB-
she
had
come
down
to
breakfast
*NL*
in
it
-RRB-
,
and
put
on
her
shawl
,
as
if
she
were
ready
for
anything
that
was
*NL*
resolute
and
uncompromising
.
Traddles
buttoned
his
coat
with
a
*NL*
determined
air
.
Mr.
Dick
,
disturbed
by
these
formidable
appearances
,
but
*NL*
feeling
it
necessary
to
imitate
them
,
pulled
his
hat
,
with
both
hands
,
*NL*
as
firmly
over
his
ears
as
he
possibly
could
;
and
instantly
took
it
off
*NL*
again
,
to
welcome
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
and
madam
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
good
morning
!
My
dear
sir
,
''
*NL*
to
Mr.
Dick
,
who
shook
hands
with
him
violently
,
``
you
are
extremely
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
breakfasted
?
''
said
Mr.
Dick
.
``
Have
a
chop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
world
,
my
good
sir
!
''
cried
Mr.
Micawber
,
stopping
him
on
*NL*
his
way
to
the
bell
;
``
appetite
and
myself
,
Mr.
Dixon
,
have
long
been
*NL*
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dixon
was
so
pleased
with
his
new
name
,
and
appeared
to
think
it
so
*NL*
very
obliging
in
Mr.
Micawber
to
confer
it
upon
him
,
that
he
shook
hands
*NL*
with
him
again
,
and
laughed
rather
childishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
attention
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
recovered
himself
,
with
a
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
''
said
my
aunt
to
Mr.
Micawber
,
as
she
put
on
her
gloves
,
``
we
*NL*
are
ready
for
Mount
Vesuvius
,
or
anything
else
,
as
soon
as

you

*NL*
please

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam

''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
I
trust
you
will
shortly
witness
an
*NL*
eruption
.
Mr.
Traddles
,
I
have
your
permission
,
I
believe
,
to
mention
*NL*
here
that
we
have
been
in
communication
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
undoubtedly
the
fact

Copperfield

''
said
Traddles
,
to
whom
I
*NL*
looked
in
surprise
.
``
Mr.
Micawber
has
consulted
me
,
in
reference
to
what
*NL*
he
has
in
contemplation
;

I

advised
him
to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
judgment
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
I
deceive
myself

Mr.
Traddles
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
what
I
*NL*
contemplate
is
a
disclosure
of
an
important
nature

*NL*
*NL*
``
Highly

said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

such
circumstances

said
Mr.

Micawber
,
``
you

the

unworthy

crushed

*NL*
``

returned
Mr.

,
``
your

of
five
minutes
by

*NL*
Stipendiary
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
and
I
looked
at
Traddles
,
who
nodded
his
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
more
,
''
observed
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
to
say
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
which
,
to
my
infinite
surprise
,
he
included
us
all
in
a
*NL*
comprehensive
bow
,
and
disappeared
;
his
manner
being
extremely
distant
,
*NL*
and
his
face
extremely
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
only
smiled
,
and
shook
his
head
-LRB-
with
his
hair
standing
upright
*NL*
on
the
top
of
it
-RRB-
,
when
I
looked
to
him
for
an
explanation
;
so
I
took
*NL*
out
my
watch
,
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
counted
off
the
five
minutes
.
My
*NL*
aunt
,
with
her
own
watch
in
her
hand
,
did
the
like
.
When
the
time
was
*NL*
expired
,
Traddles
gave
her
his
arm
;
and
we
all
went
out
together
to
the
*NL*
old
house
,
without
saying
one
word
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
Mr.
Micawber
at
his
desk
,
in
the
turret
office
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
,
either
writing
,
or
pretending
to
write
,
hard
.
The
*NL*
large
office-ruler
was
stuck
into
his
waistcoat
,
and
was
not
so
well
*NL*
concealed
but
that
a
foot
or
more
of
that
instrument
protruded
from
his
*NL*
bosom
,
like
a
new
kind
of
shirt-frill
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
appeared
to
me
that
I
was
expected
to
speak
,
I
said
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Micawber
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
gravely
,
``
I
hope
I
see
you
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Miss
Wickfield
at
home
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wickfield
is
unwell
in
bed
,
sir
,
of
a
rheumatic
fever
,
''
he
*NL*
returned
;
``
but
Miss
Wickfield
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
will
be
happy
to
see
old
*NL*
friends
.
Will
you
walk
in
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
preceded
us
to
the
dining-room
--
the
first
room
I
had
entered
in
that
*NL*
house
--
and
flinging
open
the
door
of
Mr.
Wickfield
's
former
office
,
*NL*
said
,
in
a
sonorous
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Trotwood
,
Mr.
David
Copperfield
,
Mr.
Thomas
Traddles
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Dixon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
seen
Uriah
Heep
since
the
time
of
the
blow
.
Our
visit
*NL*
astonished
him
,
evidently
;
not
the
less
,
I
dare
say
,
because
it
*NL*
astonished
ourselves
.
He
did
not
gather
his
eyebrows
together
,
for
he
*NL*
had
none
worth
mentioning
;
but
he
frowned
to
that
degree
that
he
almost
*NL*
closed
his
small
eyes
,
while
the
hurried
raising
of
his
grisly
hand
to
*NL*
his
chin
betrayed
some
trepidation
or
surprise
.
This
was
only
when
we
*NL*
were
in
the
act
of
entering
his
room
,
and
when
I
caught
a
glance
at
him
*NL*
over
my
aunt
's
shoulder
.
A
moment
afterwards
,
he
was
as
fawning
and
as
*NL*
humble
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
sure
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
is
indeed
an
unexpected
pleasure
!
To
*NL*
have
,
as
I
may
say
,
all
friends
round
Saint
Paul
's
,
at
once
,
is
a
treat
*NL*
unlooked
for
!
Mr.
Copperfield
,
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
and
--
if
I
may
*NL*
umbly
express
self
so
--
friendly
towards
them
as
is
ever
your
friends
,
*NL*
whether
or
not
.
Mrs.
Copperfield
,
sir
,
I
hope
she
's
getting
on
.
We
have
*NL*
been
made
quite
uneasy
by
the
poor
accounts
we
have
had
of
her
state
,
*NL*
lately
,
I
do
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
ashamed
to
let
him
take
my
hand
,
but
I
did
not
know
yet
what
else
*NL*
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
are
changed
in
this
office
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
since
I
was
a
numble
*NL*
clerk
,
and
held
your
pony
;
ai
n't
they
?
''
said
Uriah
,
with
his
sickliest
*NL*
smile
.
``
But
_
I
_
am
not
changed
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
returned
my
aunt
,
``
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
think
you
are
*NL*
pretty
constant
to
the
promise
of
your
youth
;
if
that
's
any
satisfaction
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Miss
Trotwood

''
said
Uriah
,
writhing
in
his
ungainly
manner
,
*NL*
``
for
your
good
opinion
!
Micawber
,
tell
'em
to
let
Miss
Agnes
know

and
*NL*
mother
.
Mother
will
be
quite
in
a
state
,
when
she
sees
the
present
*NL*
company
!
''
said
Uriah
,
setting
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
busy
,
Mr.
Heep
?
''
said
Traddles
,
whose
eye
the
cunning
red
*NL*
eye
accidentally
caught
,
as
it
at
once
scrutinised
and
evaded
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mr.
Traddles
,
''
replied
Uriah
,
resuming
his
official
seat
,
and
*NL*
squeezing
his
bony
hands
,
laid
palm
to
palm
,
between
his
bony
knees
.
*NL*
``
Not
so
much
so
,
as
I
could
wish
.
But
lawyers
,
sharks
,
and
leeches
,
are
*NL*
not
easily
satisfied
,
you
know
!
Not
but
what
myself
and
Micawber
have
*NL*
our
hands
pretty
full
,
in
general
,
on
account
of
Mr.
Wickfield
's
being
*NL*
hardly
fit
for
any
occupation
,
sir
.
But
it
's
a
pleasure
as
well
as
a
*NL*
duty
,
I
am
sure
,
to
work
for
_
him
_
.
You
've
not
been
intimate
with
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
,
I
think
,
Mr.
Traddles
?
I
believe
I
've
only
had
the
honor
of
*NL*
seeing
you
once
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
not
been
intimate
with
Mr.
Wickfield
,
''
returned
Traddles
;
*NL*
``
or
I
might
perhaps
have
waited
on
you
long
ago
,
Mr.
Heep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
tone
of
this
reply
,
which
made
Uriah
look
at
*NL*
the
speaker
again
,
with
a
very
sinister
and
suspicious
expression
.
But
,
*NL*
seeing
only
Traddles
with
his
good-natured
face
,
simple
manner
,
and
hair
*NL*
on
end
,
he
dismissed
it
as
he
replied
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
whole
body
,
*NL*
but
especially
his
throat
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
Mr.
Traddles
.
You
would
have
admired
him
as
much
*NL*
as
we
all
do
.
His
little
failings
would
only
have
endeared
him
to
you
*NL*
the
more
.
But
if
you
would
like
to
hear
my
fellow-partner
eloquently
*NL*
spoken
of
,
I
should
refer
you
to
Copperfield
.
The
family
is
a
subject
*NL*
he
's
very
strong
upon
,
if
you
never
heard
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
prevented
from
disclaiming
the
compliment
-LRB-
if
I
should
have
done
*NL*
so
,
in
any
case
-RRB-
,
by
the
entrance
of
Agnes
,
now
ushered
in
by
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
.
She
was
not
quite
so
self-possessed
as
usual
,
I
thought
;
and
*NL*
had
evidently
undergone
anxiety
and
fatigue
.
But
her
earnest
cordiality
,
*NL*
and
her
quiet
beauty
,
shone
with
the
gentler
lustre
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Uriah
watch
her
while
she
greeted
us
;
and
he
reminded
me
of
an
*NL*
ugly
and
rebellious
genie
watching
a
good
spirit
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
some
*NL*
slight
sign
passed
between
Mr.
Micawber
and
Traddles
;
and
Traddles
,
*NL*
unobserved
except
by
me
,
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
wait
,
Micawber
,
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
ruler
in
his
breast
,
stood
erect
*NL*
before
the
door
,
most
unmistakeably
contemplating
one
of
his
fellow-men
,
*NL*
and
that
man
his
employer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
''
said
Uriah
.
``
Micawber
!
Did
you
hear
me
tell
*NL*
you
not
to
wait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
replied
the
immovable
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
_
do
_
you
wait
?
''
said
Uriah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
--
in
short
choose
,
''
replied
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
a
burst
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uriah
's
cheeks
lost
colour
,
and
an
unwholesome
paleness
,
still
faintly
*NL*
tinged
by
his
pervading
red
,
overspread
them
.
He
looked
at
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
attentively
,
with
his
whole
face
breathing
short
and
quick
in
every
*NL*
feature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
dissipated
fellow
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
*NL*
effort
at
a
smile
,
``
and
I
am
afraid
you
'll
oblige
me
to
get
rid
of
you
.
*NL*
Go
along
!
I
'll
talk
to
you
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
a
scoundrel
on
this
earth
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
suddenly
*NL*
breaking
out
again
with
the
utmost
vehemence
,
``
with
whom
I
have
already
*NL*
talked
too
much
,
that
scoundrel
's
name
is
--
HEEP
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uriah
fell
back
,
as
if
he
had
been
struck
or
stung
.
Looking
slowly
round
*NL*
upon
us
with
the
darkest
and
wickedest
expression
that
his
face
could
*NL*
wear
,
he
said
,
in
a
lower
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
This
is
a
conspiracy
!
You
have
met
here

appointment

clerk

you

Now

take
care

*NL*
You
'll
make
nothing

this

We
understand
each
other
,
you

me

*NL*
There
's
no
love
between
us

You
were
always
a
puppy
with
a
proud
*NL*
stomach

from
your
first
coming
here
;
and
you
envy
me
my
rise

do
you

*NL*
None
of
your
plots
against
me

I
'll
counterplot
you

*NL*
off

I
'll
talk
to
you
presently

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Micawber

said
I
,
``
there
is
a
sudden
change
in
this
fellow

*NL*
more
respects

the
extraordinary
one
of

speaking
the
truth
in
*NL*
one
particular

which
assures
me
that
he
is
brought
to

Deal

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

a
precious
set

said
Uriah
,
in
the
same
*NL*
low
voice
,
and
breaking
out
into
a
clammy
heat
,
which
he
wiped
from
his
*NL*
forehead
,
with
his
long
lean
hand
,
``

buy
over

he
*NL*
said
,
suddenly
appearing
to
notice
,
with
alarm
,
the
absence
of
Traddles
,
*NL*
and
pulling
down
the
bell-rope
.
``
Fine
doings

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.

Traddles

returning
with
that
worthy

mother
of
a
worthy
son

``

in

composed
business-like
way

uglier

returned
Traddles
*NL*
quietly
;

Though
I
had
long
known
that
his
servility
was
false

all
his

pretences
knavish

hollow
,
I
had
had
no
adequate
conception

the

extent

his
hypocrisy

I
now
saw
him
with
his
mask
off

The
*NL*
suddenness
with
which
he
dropped
it
,
when
he
perceived
that
it
was
*NL*
useless
to
him
;
the
malice

insolence

and
hatred
,
he
revealed
;
the
leer
*NL*
with
which
he
exulted
,
even
at
this
moment

in
the
evil
he
had
done

all
*NL*
this

being
desperate
too

--
though
perfectly
consistent
with
the
*NL*
experience
I
had
of
him
,
at
first
took
even
me
by
surprise
,
who
had
*NL*
known
him
so
long
,
and
disliked
him
so
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
say
nothing
of
the
look
he
conferred
on
me
,
as
he
stood
eyeing
us
,
one
*NL*
after
another
;
for
I
had
always
understood
that
he
hated
me
,
and
I
*NL*
remembered
the
marks
of
my
hand
upon
his
cheek
.
But
when
his
eyes
passed
*NL*
on
to
Agnes
,
and
I
saw
the
rage
with
which
he
felt
his
power
over
her
*NL*
slipping
away
,
and
the
exhibition
,
in
their
disappointment
,
of
the
*NL*
odious
passions
that
had
led
him
to
aspire
to
one
whose
virtues
he
could
*NL*
never
appreciate
or
care
for
,
I
was
shocked
by
the
mere
thought
of
her
*NL*
having
lived
,
an
hour
,
within
sight
of
such
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
rubbing
of
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
and
some
looking
at
us
*NL*
with
those
bad
eyes
,
over
his
grisly
fingers
,
he
made
one
more
address
*NL*
to
me
,
half
whining
,
and
half
abusive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
it
justifiable
,
do
you
,
Copperfield
,
you
who
pride
yourself
*NL*
so
much
on
your
honor
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
to
sneak
about
my
place
,
*NL*
eaves-dropping
with
my
clerk
?
If
it
had
been
_
me
_
,
I
should
n't
have
*NL*
wondered
;
for
I
do
n't
make
myself
out
a
gentleman

I
never
*NL*
was
in
the
streets
either

you
were

to
Micawber

And
you
're
not
afraid
of
doing
this

You
do
n't
*NL*
think
at
all
of
what
I
shall
do
,
in
return

or
of
getting
yourself
*NL*
into
trouble
for
conspiracy
and
so
forth
?
Very
well

We
shall
see
!
Mr.

were
going
to
refer
some
question
to
Micawber

There
's
your
referee

Why
do
n't
you
make
him
speak
?

has
learnt
his

lesson

see

*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
what
he
said
had
no
effect
on
me
or
any
of
us
,
he
sat
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
his
table
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
one
of
his
splay
*NL*
feet
twisted
round
the
other
leg
,
waiting
doggedly
for
what
might
*NL*
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
whose
impetuosity
I
had
restrained
thus
far
with
the
*NL*
greatest
difficulty
,
and
who
had
repeatedly
interposed
with
the
first
*NL*
syllable
of
SCOUN-drel
!
without
getting
to
the
second
,
now
burst
*NL*
forward
,
drew
the
ruler
from
his
breast
-LRB-
apparently
as
a
defensive
*NL*
weapon
-RRB-
,
and
produced
from
his
pocket
a
foolscap
document
,
folded
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
large
letter
.
Opening
this
packet
,
with
his
old
flourish
,
and
*NL*
glancing
at
the
contents
,
as
if
he
cherished
an
artistic
admiration
of
*NL*
their
style
of
composition
,
he
began
to
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

my

in

low
voice

*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
without
hearing
her
,
went
on
.

*NL*
''
`
In
appearing
before
you
to
denounce
probably
the
most
consummate
*NL*
Villain
that
has
ever
existed
,
'
''
Mr.
Micawber
,
without
looking
off
the
*NL*
letter
,
pointed
the
ruler
,
like
a
ghostly
truncheon
,
at
Uriah
Heep
,
''

I
*NL*
ask
no
consideration
for

The
victim

pecuniary
liabilities
to
which
I
have
been
unable
to

I
have

ever
been
the

toy

Ignominy

have
,
collectively

separately

been
the

attendants

The
relish
with
which
Mr.
Micawber
described
himself
,
as
a
prey
to
these
*NL*
dismal
calamities
,
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
emphasis
with
which
he
*NL*
read
his
letter
;
and
the
kind
of
homage
he
rendered
to
it
with
a
roll
of

his
head

when
he
thought
he
had
hit
a

hard

In

*NL*
Uriah

more
blue

at

made
a
dart
at

to
tear

Mr.

,
with
a
perfect
miracle
of
*NL*
dexterity
or
luck
,
caught
his
advancing
knuckles
with
the
ruler
,
and
*NL*
disabled
his
right
hand
.
It
dropped
at
the
wrist
,
as

broken

The
blow
sounded
as

it
had
fallen
on

was
sensible
of

at

Mr.

making
broad-sword

crying
``

Traddles

pushed
him
back
into

got

His

muttering
to

after
wringing
his
wounded

some

slowly
drew
off

bound
it
up

held

it
in

sat
upon

looking
down

I

I

been
foreseen

That

secured

known
to

Mr.

's
enjoyment

describing

unfortunate
state

really
seemed
to
outweigh
any
pain

*NL*
anxiety

read
on

Then
it
was
that
--
HEEP

began
to
favor
me
with
just
so
much
of
his
*NL*
confidence
,
as
was
necessary
to
the
discharge

his
infernal

Then
it

I
began

if
I
may
so
Shakespearianly
express
myself

to

dwindle

peak

pine

I
found
that
my
services
were
constantly
called

into
requisition

the
falsification
of
business

and
the
*NL*
mystification
of
an
individual

I
will
designate
as
Mr.

That
Mr.

W.
was
imposed
upon

kept
in

deluded

in

possible

that
all

was
professing

unbounded
gratitude

unbounded
friendship

abused

was
bad

observes

Mr.

struck

obtained

importance

representing
them

be
other

He
induced
Mr.

to
empower
him
to
draw

out

thus

one
particular
sum
of
trust-money

amounting

fourteen

pretended

were
either
already
provided

gave
this

throughout

the

appearance

HEEP
has
,
on
several
occasions
,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
,
*NL*
information
,
and
belief
,
systematically
forged
,
to
various
entries
,
*NL*
books
,
and
documents
,
the
signature
of
Mr.
W.
;
and
has
distinctly
done
*NL*
so
in
one
instance
,
capable
of
proof
by
me
.
To
wit
,
in
manner
following
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
:
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
Mr.
Micawber
had
a
relish
in
this
formal
piling
up
of
words
,
*NL*
which
,
however
ludicrously
displayed
in
his
case
,
was
,
I
must
say
,
not
*NL*
at
all
peculiar
to
him
.
I
have
observed
it
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
in
*NL*
numbers
of
men
.
It
seems
to
me
to
be
a
general
rule
.
In
the
taking
of
*NL*
legal
oaths
,
for
instance
,
deponents
seem
to
enjoy
themselves
mightily
*NL*
when
they
come
to
several
good
words
in
succession
,
for
the
expression
*NL*
of
one
idea
;
as
,
that
they
utterly
detest
,
abominate
,
and
abjure
,
or
so
*NL*
forth
;
and
the
old
anathemas
were
made
relishing
on
the
same
principle
.
*NL*
We
talk
about
the
tyranny
of
words
,
but
we
like
to
tyrannise
over
them
*NL*
too
;
we
are
fond
of
having
a
large
superfluous
establishment
of
words
to
*NL*
wait
upon
us
on
great
occasions
;
we
think
it
looks
important
,
and
sounds
*NL*
well
.
As
we
are
not
particular
about
the
meaning
of
our
liveries
on
*NL*
state
occasions
,
if
they
be
but
fine
and
numerous
enough
,
so
,
the
*NL*
meaning
or
necessity
of
our
words
is
a
secondary
consideration
,
if
there
*NL*
be
but
a
great
parade
of
them
.
And
as
individuals
get
into
trouble
by
*NL*
making
too
great
a
show
of
liveries
,
or
as
slaves
when
they
are
too
*NL*
numerous
rise
against
their
masters
,
so
I
think
I
could
mention
a
nation
*NL*
that
has
got
into
many
great
difficulties
,
and
will
get
into
many
*NL*
greater
,
from
maintaining
too
large
a
retinue
of
words
.

To

is

Mr.

infirm

*NL*
it
being
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
his
decease
might
lead
to

some
discoveries
,
and
to
the
downfall
of

HEEP

power
over
the
W.
*NL*
family
,
--
as
I
,
Wilkins
Micawber
,
the

,
assume

unless
the

filial
affection
of
his
daughter
could
be
secretly
influenced
from
*NL*
allowing
any
investigation
of
the
partnership
affairs
to
be
ever
made
,
*NL*
the
said
--
HEEP

deemed
it
expedient
to
have
a
bond
ready
by
him
,
as
from
*NL*
Mr.
W.
,
for
the
before-mentioned
sum
of
twelve
six
fourteen

two

nine

with
interest
,
stated
therein
to
have
been
advanced
by

to
save
Mr.

from
dishonor
;
though
really
the
sum
was
never

him

has
long
been
replaced

took
out

opened

suddenly
bethought

that
is

had

early
this

relinquished
it

It
was
singular
to
see
how
the

still
held
to
the
old
trick
,
when
*NL*
the
son
had
abandoned
it
as
useless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
said
,
with
an
impatient
bite
at
the
handkerchief
in
which
*NL*
his

was
wrapped
,
``
you
had
better

fire

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
love

cried
Mrs.

And
I
have
no
doubt
she
did
;
or
*NL*
that
he
loved
her
,
however
strange
it
may
appear
;
though
,
to
be
sure
,
*NL*
they
were
a
congenial

told

told

up-stairs

come
to

*NL*
``

he
angrily
retorted
,
pointing
his
*NL*
lean
finger
at
me
,
against
whom
all
his
animosity
was
levelled
,
as
the
*NL*
prime
mover
in
the
discovery
;
and
I
did
not
undeceive
him
;
``

He
remained
for
a
little
,
biting
the
handkerchief
,

then
said
to
me

with
a
scowl
:

Mr.

promptly
resumed

`
Third
.
And
last
.
I
am
now
in
a
condition
to
show
,
by
--
HEEP
'S
--
false
*NL*
books
,
and
--
HEEP
'S
--
real
memoranda
,
beginning
with
the
partially
*NL*
destroyed
pocket-book
-LRB-
which
I
was
unable
to
comprehend
,
at
the
time
*NL*
of
its
accidental
discovery
by
Mrs.
Micawber
,
on
our
taking
possession
*NL*
of
our
present
abode
,
in
the
locker
or
binn
devoted
to
the
reception
*NL*
of
the
ashes
calcined
on
our
domestic
hearth
-RRB-
,
that
the
weaknesses
,
*NL*
the
faults
,
the
very
virtues
,
the
parental
affections
,
and
the
sense
*NL*
of
honor
,
of
the
unhappy
Mr.
W.
have
been
for
years
acted
on
by
,
and
*NL*
warped
to
the
base
purposes
of
--
HEEP
.
That
Mr.
W.
has
been
for
years
*NL*
deluded
and
plundered
,
in
every
conceivable
manner
,
to
the
pecuniary
*NL*
aggrandisement
of
the
avaricious
,
false
,
and
grasping
--
HEEP
.
That
the
*NL*
engrossing
object
of
--
HEEP
--
was
,
next
to
gain
,
to
subdue
Mr.
and
Miss
*NL*
W.
-LRB-
of
his
ulterior
views
in
reference
to
the
latter
I
say
nothing
-RRB-
*NL*
entirely
to
himself
.
That
his
last
act
,
completed
but
a
few
months
*NL*
since
,
was
to
induce
Mr.
W.
to
execute
a
relinquishment
of
his
share
*NL*
in
the
partnership
,
and
even
a
bill
of
sale
on
the
very
furniture
of
*NL*
his
house
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annuity
,
to
be
well
and
truly
*NL*
paid
by
--
HEEP
--
on
the
four
common
quarter-days
in
each
and
every
year
.
*NL*
That
these
meshes
;
beginning
with
alarming
and
falsified
accounts
of
*NL*
the
estate
of
which
Mr.
W.
is
the
receiver
,
at
a
period
when
Mr.
W.
*NL*
had
launched
into
imprudent
and
ill-judged
speculations
,
and
may
not
*NL*
have
had
the
money
,
for
which
he
was
morally
and
legally
responsible
,
*NL*
in
hand
;
going
on
with
pretended
borrowings
of
money
at
enormous
*NL*
interest
,
really
coming
from
--
HEEP
--
and
by
--
HEEP
--
fraudulently
obtained
*NL*
or
withheld
from
Mr.
W.
himself
,
on
pretence
of
such
speculations
or
*NL*
otherwise
;
perpetuated
by
a
miscellaneous
catalogue
of
unscrupulous
*NL*
chicaneries
--
gradually
thickened
,
until
the
unhappy
Mr.
W.
could
see
no
*NL*
world
beyond
.
Bankrupt
,
as
he
believed
,
alike
in
circumstances
,
in
all
*NL*
other
hope
,
and
in
honor
,
his
sole
reliance
was
upon
the
monster
in
the
*NL*
garb
of
man
,
'
''
--
Mr.
Micawber
made
a
good
deal
of
this
,
as
a
new
turn
of
*NL*
expression
,
--
''
`
who
,
by
making
himself
necessary
to
him
,
had
achieved
*NL*
his
destruction
.
All
this
I
undertake
to
show
.
Probably
much
more
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
whispered
a
few
words
to
Agnes
,
who
was
weeping
,
half
joyfully
,
*NL*
half-sorrowfully
,
at
my
side
;
and
there
was
a
movement
among
us
,
as
if
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
had
finished
.
He
said
,
with
exceeding
gravity
,
``
Pardon
*NL*
me
,
''
and
proceeded
,
with
a
mixture
of
the
lowest
spirits
and
the
most
*NL*
intense
enjoyment
,
to
the
peroration
of
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
have
now
concluded
.
It
merely
remains
for
me
to
substantiate
these
*NL*
accusations
;
and
then
,
with
my
ill-starred
family
,
to
disappear
from
*NL*
the
landscape
on
which
we
appear
to
be
an
incumbrance
.
That
is
soon
*NL*
done
.
It
may
be
reasonably
inferred
that
our
baby
will
first
expire
of
*NL*
inanition
,
as
being
the
frailest
member
of
our
circle
;
and
that
our
*NL*
twins
will
follow
next
in
order
.
So
be
it
!
For
myself
,
my
Canterbury
*NL*
Pilgrimage
has
done
much
;
imprisonment
on
civil
process
,
and
want
,
will
*NL*
soon
do
more
.
I
trust
that
the
labor
and
hazard
of
an
investigation
--
of
*NL*
which
the
smallest
results
have
been
slowly
pieced
together
,
in
the
*NL*
pressure
of
arduous
avocations
,
under
grinding
penurious
apprehensions
,
*NL*
at
rise
of
morn
,
at
dewy
eve
,
in
the
shadows
of
night
,
under
the
*NL*
watchful
eye
of
one
whom
it
were
superfluous
to
call
Demon
--
combined
*NL*
with
the
struggle
of
parental
Poverty
to
turn
it
,
when
completed
,
to
*NL*
the
right
account
,
may
be
as
the
sprinkling
of
a
few
drops
of
sweet
*NL*
water
on
my
funereal
pyre
.
I
ask
no
more

Let
it
be
,
in
justice

merely
*NL*
said
of
me
,
as
of
a
gallant

eminent
naval
Hero

with

I
have

no

did
n't
,
even
to
Trot
,
as
he
knows
--
breathe
a
*NL*
syllable
of
its
having
been
placed
here
for
investment
.
But
,
now
I
know
*NL*
this
fellow
's
answerable
for
it
,
and
I
'll
have
it
!
Trot
,
come
and
take
*NL*
it
away
from
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
my
aunt
supposed
,
for
the
moment
,
that
he
kept
her
property
in
*NL*
his
neck-kerchief
,
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
;
but
she
certainly
pulled
at
*NL*
it
as
if
she
thought
so
.
I
hastened
to
put
myself
between
them
,
and
to
*NL*
assure
her
that
we
would
all
take
care
that
he
should
make
the
utmost
*NL*
restitution
of
everything
he
had
wrongly
got
.
This
,
and
a
few
moments
'
*NL*
reflection
,
pacified
her
;
but
she
was
not
at
all
disconcerted
by
what
*NL*
she
had
done
-LRB-
though
I
can
not
say
as
much
for
her
bonnet
-RRB-
and
resumed
*NL*
her
seat
composedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
few
minutes
,
Mrs.
Heep
had
been
clamoring
to
her
son
to
*NL*
be
``
umble
;
''
and
had
been
going
down
on
her
knees
to
all
of
us
in
*NL*
succession
,
and
making
the
wildest
promises
.
Her
son
sat
her
down
in
his
*NL*
chair
;
and
,
standing
sulkily
by
her
,
holding
her
arm
with
his
hand
,
but
*NL*
not
rudely
,
said
to
me
,
with
a
ferocious
look
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
what
must
be
done
,
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
that
Copperfield
no
tongue
?
''
muttered
Uriah
.
``
I
would
do
a
good
*NL*
deal
for
you
if
you
could
tell
me
,
without
lying
,
that
somebody
had
cut
*NL*
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Uriah
means
to
be
umble
!
''
cried
his
mother
.
``
Do
n't
mind
what
he
*NL*
says
,
good
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
must
be
done
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
is
this
.
First
,
the
deed
of
*NL*
relinquishment
,
that
we
have
heard
of
,
must
be
given
over
to
me
*NL*
now
--
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
I
have
n't
got
it
,
''
he
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
,
''
said
Traddles
;
``
therefore
,
you
know
,
we
wo
n't
suppose
*NL*
so
.
''
And
I
can
not
help
avowing
that
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
*NL*
I
really
did
justice
to
the
clear
head
,
and
the
plain
,
patient
,
*NL*
practical
good
sense
,
of
my
old
schoolfellow
.
``
Then
,
''
said
Traddles
,
*NL*
``
you
must
prepare
to
disgorge
all
that
your
rapacity
has
become
*NL*
possessed
of
,
and
to
make
restoration
to
the
last
farthing
.
All
the
*NL*
partnership
books
and
papers
must
remain
in
our
possession
;
all
your
*NL*
books
and
papers
;
all
money
accounts
and
securities
,
of
both
kinds
.
In
*NL*
short
,
everything
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
it
?
I
do
n't
know
that
,
''
said
Uriah
.
``
I
must
have
time
to
think
*NL*
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
replied
Traddles
;
``
but
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
until
*NL*
everything
is
done
to
our
satisfaction
,
we
shall
maintain
possession
of
*NL*
these
things
;
and
beg
you
--
in
short
,
compel
you
--
to
keep
your
own
room
,
*NL*
and
hold
no
communication
with
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
do
it
!
''
said
Uriah
,
with
an
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maidstone
Jail
is
a
safer
place
of
detention
,
''
observed
Traddles
;
``
and
*NL*
though
the
law
may
be
longer
in
righting
us
,
and
may
not
be
able
to
*NL*
right
us
so
completely
as
you
can
,
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
punishing
*NL*
_
you
_
.
Dear
me
,
you
know
that
quite
as
well
as
I
!
Copperfield
,
will
you
*NL*
go
round
to
the
Guildhall
,
and
bring
a
couple
of
officers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
Mrs.
Heep
broke
out
again
,
crying
on
her
knees
to
Agnes
to
*NL*
interfere
in
their
behalf
,
exclaiming
that
he
was
very
humble
,
and
it
*NL*
was
all
true
,
and
if
he
did
n't
do
what
we
wanted
,
she
would
,
and
much
*NL*
more
to
the
same
purpose
;
being
half
frantic
with
fears
for
her
darling
.
*NL*
To
inquire
what
he
might
have
done
,
if
he
had
had
any
boldness
,
would
be
*NL*
like
inquiring
what
a
mongrel
cur
might
do
,
if
it
had
the
spirit
of
a
*NL*
tiger
.
He
was
a
coward
,
from
head
to
foot
;
and
showed
his
dastardly
*NL*
nature
through
his
sullenness
and
mortification
,
as
much
as
at
any
time
*NL*
of
his
mean
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
he
growled
to
me
;
and
wiped
his
hot
face
with
his
hand
.
``
Mother
,
*NL*
hold
your
noise
.
Well
!
Let
'em
have
that
deed
.
Go
and
fetch
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
help
her
,
Mr.
Dick
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Proud
of
his
commission
,
and
understanding
it
,
Mr.
Dick
accompanied
her
*NL*
as
a
shepherd
's
dog
might
accompany
a
sheep
.
But
,
Mrs.
Heep
gave
him
*NL*
little
trouble
;
for
she
not
only
returned
with
the
deed
,
but
with
the
*NL*
box
in
which
it
was
,
where
we
found
a
banker
's
book
and
some
other
*NL*
papers
that
were
afterwards
serviceable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Traddles
,
when
this
was
brought
.
``
Now
,
Mr.
Heep
,
you
can
*NL*
retire
to
think
:
particularly
observing
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
declare
*NL*
to
you
,
on
the
part
of
all
present
,
that
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
*NL*
done
;
that
it
is
what
I
have
explained
;
and
that
it
must
be
done
without
*NL*
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uriah
,
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
ground
,
shuffled
across
the
*NL*
room
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
,
and
pausing
at
the
door
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copperfield
,
I
have
always
hated
you
.
You
've
always
been
an
upstart

always
been
against
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
think
I
told
you
once
before

said
I
,
``
it
is
you

*NL*
in
your
greed

cunning

against

It
may
be
profitable
*NL*
to
you
to
reflect
,
in
future
,
that
there
never
were
greed

cunning
in
*NL*
the
world
yet
,
that
did
not
do
too
much

over-reach
themselves

as
certain
as
death

*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
as
certain

picked
up
so
much
umbleness
-RRB-
,
from
nine
o'clock
to
eleven
,
that
labor
*NL*
was
a
curse
;
and
from
eleven
o'clock
to
one
,
that
it
was
a
blessing
*NL*

a
cheerfulness
,
and
a
dignity
,

I
do
n't
know
what
all

*NL*
said
he
with
a
sneer
.
``
You
preach

about
as
consistent
as
they
did

Wo

down

round
my

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
supremely
defiant
of
him
and
his
extended
finger
,
and
*NL*
making
a
great
deal
of
his
chest
until
he
had
slunk
out
at
the
door
,
*NL*
then
addressed
himself
to
me
,
and
proffered
me
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
``
witnessing
the
re-establishment
of
mutual
confidence
between
himself
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Micawber
.
''
After
which
,
he
invited
the
company
generally
to
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
that
affecting
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
Restoration
of
mutual
confidence
between

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
veil
that
has
long
been
interposed
between
Mrs.
Micawber
and
*NL*
myself
,
is
now
withdrawn
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
;
``
and
my
children
and
the
*NL*
Author
of
their
Being
can
once
more
come
in
contact
on
equal
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
all
very
grateful
to
him
,
and
all
desirous
to
show
that
we
*NL*
were
,
as
well
as
the
hurry
and
disorder
of
our
spirits
would
permit
,
I
*NL*
dare
say
we
should
all
have
gone
,
but
that
it
was
necessary
for
Agnes
to
*NL*
return
to
her
father
,
as
yet
unable
to
bear
more
than
the
dawn
of
hope
;
*NL*
and
for
some
one
else
to
hold
Uriah
in
safe
keeping
.
So
,
Traddles
*NL*
remained
for
the
latter
purpose
,
to
be
presently
relieved
by
Mr.
Dick
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Dick
,
my
aunt
,
and
I
,
went
home
with
Mr.
Micawber
.
As
I
parted
*NL*
hurriedly
from
the
dear
girl
to
whom
I
owed
so
much
,
and
thought
from
*NL*
what
she
had
been
saved
,
perhaps
,
that
morning
--
her
better
resolution
*NL*
notwithstanding
--
I
felt
devoutly
thankful
for
the
miseries
of
my
younger
*NL*
days
which
had
brought
me
to
the
knowledge
of
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
house
was
not
far
off
;
and
as
the
street-door
opened
into
the
*NL*
sitting
room
,
and
he
bolted
in
with
a
precipitation
quite
his
own
,
we
*NL*
found
ourselves
at
once
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
.
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
Emma
!
my
life
!
''
rushed
into
Mrs.
Micawber
's
arms
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
shrieked
,
and
folded
Mr.
Micawber
in
her
embrace
.
Miss
*NL*
Micawber
,
nursing
the
unconscious
stranger
of
Mrs.
Micawber
's
last
*NL*
letter
to
me
,
was
sensibly
affected
.
The
stranger
leaped
.
The
twins
*NL*
testified
their
joy
by
several
inconvenient
but
innocent
demonstrations
.
*NL*
Master
Micawber
,
whose
disposition
appeared
to
have
been
soured
by
early
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
whose
aspect
had
become
morose
,
yielded
to
his
*NL*
better
feelings
,
and
blubbered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
!
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
.
``
The
cloud
is
past
from
my
mind
.
Mutual
*NL*
confidence
,
so
long
preserved
between
us
once
,
is
restored
,
to
know
no
*NL*
farther
interruption
.
Now
,
welcome
poverty
!
''
cried
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
shedding
tears
.
``
Welcome
misery
,
welcome
houselessness

welcome
hunger

*NL*
rags

tempest

and

will
sustain
us
to
the
*NL*
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
expressions
,
Mr.
Micawber
placed
Mrs.
Micawber
in
a
chair
,
*NL*
and
embraced
the
family
all
round
;
welcoming
a
variety
of
bleak
*NL*
prospects
,
which
appeared
,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
,
to
be
anything
*NL*
but
welcome
to
them
;
and
calling
upon
them
to
come
out
into
Canterbury
*NL*
and
sing
a
chorus
,
as
nothing
else
was
left
for
their
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Micawber
having
,
in
the
strength
of
her
emotions
,
fainted
away
,
*NL*
the
first
thing
to
be
done
,
even
before
the
chorus
could
be
considered
*NL*
complete
,
was
to
recover
her
.
This
,
my
aunt
and
Mr.
Micawber
did
;
and
*NL*
then
my
aunt
was
introduced
,
and
Mrs.
Micawber
recognised
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
the
poor
lady
,
giving
me
her
*NL*
hand
,
``
but
I
am
not
strong
;
and
the
removal
of
the
late
misunderstanding
*NL*
between
Mr.
Micawber

was
at
first
too
much
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
all
your

said
my
aunt

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

returned
Mrs.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

I
did
n't

my

I

all

yours

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam

replied
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
it
is
a
true
bill

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
eldest
young
gentleman
,
now

said
my
aunt
,
musing
.
``
What
has
*NL*
_
he
_
been
brought
up
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
hope
when
I
came
here
,

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
to
have
got

Wilkins
into
the
Church
:

perhaps
I
shall
express
my
meaning
more
*NL*
strictly

if
I
say
the
Choir
.
But
there
was
no
vacancy
for
a
tenor
in
*NL*
the
venerable
Pile
for
which
this
city
is
so
justly
eminent
;
and
he
*NL*
has
--
in
short

he
has
contracted
a
habit

singing
in
public-houses

rather
than
in
sacred
edifices

*NL*
*NL*
``

well

said
Mrs.
Micawber

tenderly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say

my
love

rejoined
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
that
he
means
*NL*
particularly
well
;
but
I
have
not
yet
found
that

carries
out
his

meaning
,
in
any
given
direction
whatsoever

''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Micawber
's
moroseness
of
aspect
returned
upon
him
again
,
and
he
*NL*
demanded
,
with
some
temper
,
what
he
was
to
do
?
Whether
he
had
been
born
*NL*
a
carpenter
,
or
a
coach
painter
,
any
more
than
he
had
been
born
a
bird
?
*NL*
Whether
he
could
go
into
the
next
street
,
and
open
a
chemist
's
shop
?
*NL*
Whether
he
could
rush
to
the
next
assizes
,
and
proclaim
himself
a
*NL*
lawyer
?
Whether
he
could
come
out
by
force
at
the
opera
,
and
succeed
by
*NL*
violence
?
Whether
he
could
do
anything
,
without
being
brought
up
to
*NL*
something
?
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
mused
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Micawber

I
wonder
you

never

``
Madam

returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
it
was
the
dream
of
my
youth

the
*NL*
fallacious
aspiration

my
riper
years

I
am
thoroughly
persuaded

by

had
never
thought

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

''
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
glance
at
me
.
``
Why

what
a
thing
it
would
be

for
yourselves

urged
Mr.

gloomily

*NL*
*NL*

That

the
principal

I

the

assented
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital

cried
my
aunt
.
``
But
you
are
doing
us
a
great
service

have
*NL*
done
us
a
great
service
,
I
may
say
,
for
surely
much
will
come
out
of
the
*NL*
fire
--
and
what
could
we
do
for
you
,
that
would
be
half
so
good
as
to

find
the
capital

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
receive
it

said
Mr.
Micawber

full
of
fire
and

animation

``

sufficient
sum

be
advanced

at
five

*NL*
``
Could

Can

be

returned
my

*NL*
``
if
you
say
the
word

Think
of
this
now

both
of

Here
are
some

going
out

Australia
shortly

If

go

*NL*
why
should
n't
you
go
in

You
may
help

Think
of
*NL*
this
now

Mr.

Mrs.
Micawber

Take
your
time

and
weigh
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
but
one
question
,
my

ma'am

I
could
wish
to
ask

said
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
The
climate

I
believe

is
healthy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Finest
in

said
my
aunt

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
Then
my
question
arises
.
Now
,
_
are
_
*NL*
the
circumstances
of
the
country
such
,
that
a
man
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
*NL*
abilities
would
have
a
fair
chance
of
rising
in
the
social
scale
?
I
will
*NL*
not
say
,
at
present
,
might
he
aspire
to
be
Governor
,
or
anything
of
that
*NL*
sort
;
but
would
there
be
a
reasonable
opening
for
his
talents
to
develop
*NL*
themselves
--
that
,
would
be
amply
sufficient
--
and
find
their
own
*NL*
expansion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
better
opening
anywhere
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
for
a
man
who
conducts
*NL*
himself
well
,

is
industrious

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
man

conducts
himself
well

''
repeated
Mrs.
Micawber
,
with
her
*NL*
clearest
business
manner
,
``
and
is
industrious

Precisely
.
It
is
evident
*NL*
to
me
that
Australia
is
the
legitimate
sphere

action
for
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entertain
the
conviction

my

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
that
it
*NL*
is
,
under

that
something
of
an
extraordinary
nature
will
turn
up

It
is
no
distance

comparatively
speaking
;

though
*NL*
consideration
is
due

the
kindness

I
assure

I

was

most
sanguine
of

*NL*
looking
on
to
fortune
;
or
how
Mrs.
Micawber
presently
discoursed
about
*NL*
the
habits
of
the
kangaroo
!
Shall
I
ever
recall
that
street
of
*NL*
Canterbury
on
a
market
day
,
without
recalling
him
,
as
he
walked
back
*NL*
with
us
;
expressing
,
in
the
hardy
roving
manner
he
assumed
,
the
*NL*
unsettled
habits
of
a
temporary
sojourner
in
the
land
;

looking
at
*NL*
the
bullocks

they
came
by

CHAPTER
LIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
ANOTHER
RETROSPECT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
pause
yet
once
again
.
O
,
my
child-wife
,
there
is
a
figure
in
the
*NL*
moving
crowd
before
my
memory
,
quiet
and
still
,
saying
in
its
innocent
*NL*
love
and
childish
beauty
,
Stop
to
think
of
me
--
turn
to
look
upon
the
*NL*
little
blossom
,
as
it
flutters
to
the
ground
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
.
All
else
grows
dim
,
and
fades
away
.
I
am
again
with
Dora
,
in
our
*NL*
cottage
.
I
do
not
know
how
long
she
has
been
ill
.
I
am
so
used
to
it
in
*NL*
feeling
,
that
I
can
not
count
the
time
.
It
is
not
really
long
,
in
weeks
*NL*
or
months
;
but
,
in
my
usage
and
experience
,
it
is
a
weary
,
weary
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
have
left
off
telling
me
to
``
wait
a
few
days
more
.
''
I
have
begun
*NL*
to
fear
,
remotely
,
that
the
day
may
never
shine
,
when
I
shall
see
my
*NL*
child-wife
running
in
the
sunlight
with
her
old
friend
Jip
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
,
as
it
were
suddenly
,
grown
very
old
.
It
may
be
,
that
he
misses
in
*NL*
his
mistress
,
something
that
enlivened
him
and
made
him
younger
;
but
he
*NL*
mopes
,
and
his
sight
is
weak
,
and
his
limbs
are
feeble
,
and
my
aunt
is
*NL*
sorry
that
he
objects
to
her
no
more
,
but
creeps
near
her
as
he
lies
on
*NL*
Dora
's
bed
--
she
sitting
at
the
bedside
--
and
mildly
licks
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dora
lies
smiling
on
us
,
and
is
beautiful
,
and
utters
no
hasty
or
*NL*
complaining
word
.
She
says
that
we
are
very
good
to
her
;
that
her
*NL*
dear
old
careful
boy
is
tiring
himself
out
,
she
knows
;
that
my
aunt
*NL*
has
no
sleep
,
yet
is
always
wakeful
,
active
,
and
kind
.
Sometimes
,
the
*NL*
little
bird-like
ladies
come
to
see
her
;
and
then
we
talk
about
our
*NL*
wedding-day
,
and
all
that
happy
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
strange
rest
and
pause
in
my
life
there
seems
to
be
--
and
in
all
*NL*
life
,
within
doors
and
without
--
when
I
sit
in
the
quiet
,
shaded
,
*NL*
orderly
,
room
,
with
the
blue
eyes
of
my
child-wife
turned
towards
me
,
*NL*
and
her
little
fingers
twining
round
my
hand
!
Many
and
many
an
hour
I
*NL*
sit
thus
;
but
,
of
all
those
times
,
three
times
come
the
freshest
on
my
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
morning
;
and
Dora
,
made
so
trim
by
my
aunt
's
hands
,
shews
me
how
*NL*
her
pretty
hair
_
will
_
curl
upon
the
pillow
yet
,
and
how
long
and
bright
*NL*
it
is
,
and
how
she
likes
to
have
it
loosely
gathered
in
that
net
she
*NL*
wears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
am
vain
of
it
,
now
,
you
mocking
boy
,
''
she
says
,
when
I
*NL*
smile
;
``
but
because
you
used
to
say
you
thought
it
so
beautiful
;
and
*NL*
because
,
when
I
first
began
to
think
about
you
,
I
used
to
peep
in
the
*NL*
glass
,
and
wonder
whether
you
would
like
very
much
to
have
a
lock
of
it
.
*NL*
Oh
what
a
foolish
fellow
you
were
,
Doady
,
when
I
gave
you
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
on
the
day
when
you
were
painting
the
flowers
I
had
given
you
,
*NL*
Dora
,
and
when
I
told
you
how
much
in
love
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
I
did
n't
like
to
tell
_
you
_
,
''
says
Dora
,
''
_
then
_
,
how
I
had
*NL*
cried
over
them
,
because
I
believed
you
really
liked
me
!
When
I
can
run
*NL*
about
again
as
I
used
to
do
,
Doady
,
let
us
go
and
see
those
places
where
*NL*
we
were
such
a
silly
couple
,
shall
we
?
And
take
some
of
the
old
walks
?
*NL*
And
not
forget
poor
papa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
will
,
and
have
some
happy
days
.
So
you
must
make
haste
to
get
*NL*
well
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
soon
do
that

I
am
so
much
better

do
n't

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
evening
;
and
I
sit
in
the
same
chair
,
by
the
same
bed
,
with
the
*NL*
same
face
turned
towards
me
.
We
have
been
silent
,
and
there
is
a
smile
*NL*
upon
her
face
.
I
have
ceased
to
carry
my
light
burden
up
and
down
stairs
*NL*
now

She
lies
here
all
the
day

It
is
night

I
am
with
her
still

Agnes
has
arrived
;
has
been
among
*NL*
us
,
for
a
whole
day
and
an
evening
.
She
,
my
aunt
,
and
I
,
have
sat
with
*NL*
Dora
since
the
morning
,
all
together
.
We
have
not
talked
much
,
but
Dora
*NL*
has
been
perfectly
contented
and
cheerful
.
We
are
now
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
I
know
,
now
,
that
my
child-wife
will
soon
leave
me
?
They
have
told
me
*NL*
so
;
they
have
told
me
nothing
new
to
my
thoughts
;
but
I
am
far
from
sure
*NL*
that
I
have
taken
that
truth
to
heart
.
I
can
not
master
it
.
I
have
*NL*
withdrawn
by
myself
,
many
times
to-day
,
to
weep
.
I
have
remembered
Who
*NL*
wept
for
a
parting
between
the
living
and
the
dead
.
I
have
bethought
me
*NL*
of
all
that
gracious
and
compassionate
history
.
I
have
tried
to
resign
*NL*
myself
,
and
to
console
myself
;
and
that
,
I
hope
,
I
may
have
done
*NL*
imperfectly
;
but
what
I
can
not
firmly
settle
in
my
mind
is
,
that
the
end
*NL*
will
absolutely
come
.
I
hold
her
hand
in
mine
,
I
hold
her
heart
in
mine
,
*NL*
I
see
her
love
for
me
,
alive
in
all
its
strength

I
can
not
shut
out
a
*NL*
pale
lingering
shadow
of
belief
that
she
will
be
spared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

lay
my
face
upon
the
pillow
by
her
,
and
she
looks
into
my
eyes
,
and
*NL*
speaks
very
softly
.
Gradually
,
as
she
goes
on
,
I
feel
,
with
a
stricken
*NL*
heart
,
that
she
is
speaking
of
herself
as
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
dear
,
I
was
too
young
.
I
do
n't
mean
in
years
only
,
but
in
*NL*
experience
,
and
thoughts
,
and
everything
.
I
was
such
a
silly
little
*NL*
creature
!
I
am
afraid
it
would
have
been
better
,
if
we
had
only
loved
*NL*
each
other
as
a
boy
and
girl
,
and
forgotten
it
.
I
have
begun
to
think
I
*NL*
was
not
fit
to
be
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
try
to
stay
my
tears
,
and
to
reply
,
``
Oh
,
Dora
,
love
,
as
fit
as
I
to
be
*NL*
a
husband
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

''
with
the
old
shake
of
her
curls
.
``
Perhaps
!
But
,
if
I
had
*NL*
been
more
fit
to
be
married
,
I
might
have
made
you
more
so

too

Besides

you
are
very
clever

I
never
was

happy

very

as
years
went
on

have
*NL*
wearied
of
his
child-wife

She
would
have
been
less

less
a
companion

him

He
would
have
been
more

more
sensible
of
what
was
wanting
*NL*
in

She

n't
have
improved

*NL*
*NL*
``

Dora

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she
answers
,
kissing
me
.

a

you

in

it
was
all
the
merit
I
had
,
except
being
pretty

you

to
speak
to

*NL*
*NL*
I
promise
that
she
shall
,
immediately
;

I
can
not
leave
her
,
for
my
*NL*
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
that
it
was
better

she
whispers
,
as
she
holds
me
in
*NL*
her
arms
.
``
Oh

Doady

after
more
years

you
never
could
have
loved
your

child-wife
better
than
you
do
;
and
,
after
more
years
,
she
would
so
have
*NL*
tried
and
disappointed
you
,
that
you
might
not
have
been
able
to
love
*NL*
her
half
so
well
!
I
know
I
was
too
young
and
foolish

It
is
much
better
*NL*
as
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
is
down-stairs
,
when
I
go
into
the
parlor
;
and
I
give
her
the
*NL*
message
.
She
disappears
,
leaving
me
alone
with
Jip
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Chinese
house
is
by
the
fire
;
and
he
lies
within
it
,
on
his
bed
of
*NL*
flannel
,
querulously
trying
to
sleep
.
The
bright
moon
is
high
and
clear
.
*NL*
As
I
look
out
on
the
night
,
my
tears
fall
fast
,
and
my
undisciplined
*NL*
heart
is
chastened
heavily
--
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sit
down
by
the
fire
,
thinking
with
a
blind
remorse
of
all
those
*NL*
secret
feelings
I
have
nourished
since
my
marriage
.
I
think
of
every
*NL*
little
trifle
between
me
and
Dora
,
and
feel
the
truth
,
that
trifles
make
*NL*
the
sum
of
life
.
Ever
rising
from
the
sea
of
my
remembrance
,
is
the
*NL*
image
of
the
dear
child
as
I
knew
her
first
,
graced
by
my
young
love
,
*NL*
and
by
her
own
,
with
every
fascination
wherein
such
love
is
rich
.
Would
*NL*
it
,
indeed
,
have
been
better
if
we
had
loved
each
other
as
a
boy
and
*NL*
girl
,
and
forgotten
it
?
Undisciplined
heart
,
reply
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
the
time
wears
,
I
know
not
;
until
I
am
recalled
by
my
child-wife
's
*NL*
old
companion
.
More
restless
than
he
was
,
he
crawls
out
of
his
house
,
*NL*
and
looks
at
me
,
and
wanders
to
the
door
,
and
whines
to
go
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-night
,
Jip
!
Not
to-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
comes
very
slowly
back
to
me
,
licks
my
hand
,
and
lifts
his
dim
eyes
*NL*
to
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Jip
!
It
may
be
,
never
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lies
down
at
my
feet
,
stretches
himself
out
as
if
to
sleep
,
and
with
*NL*
a
plaintive
cry
,
is
dead
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
MR.
MICAWBER
'S
TRANSACTIONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
not
the
time
at
which
I
am
to
enter
on
the
state
of
my
mind
*NL*
beneath
its
load
of
sorrow
.
I
came
to
think
that
the
Future
was
walled
*NL*
up
before
me
,
that
the
energy
and
action
of
my
life
were
at
an
end
,
that
*NL*
I
never
could
find
any
refuge
but
in
the
grave
.
I
came
to
think
so
,
I
*NL*
say
,
but
not
in
the
first
shock
of
my
grief
.
It
slowly
grew
to
that
.
If
*NL*
the
events
I
go
on
to
relate
,
had
not
thickened
around
me
,
in
the
*NL*
beginning
to
confuse
,
and
in
the
end
to
augment
,
my
affliction
,
it
is
*NL*
possible
,
-LRB-
though
I
think
not
probable
-RRB-
,
that
I
might
have
fallen
at
*NL*
once
into
this
condition
.
As
it
was
,
an
interval
occurred
before
I
fully
*NL*
knew
my
own
distress
;
an
interval
,
in
which
I
even
supposed
that
its
*NL*
sharpest
pangs
were
past
;
and
when
my
mind
could
soothe
itself
by
*NL*
resting
on
all
that
was
most
innocent
and
beautiful
,
in
the
tender
story
*NL*
that
was
closed
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
first
proposed
that
I
should
go
abroad
,
or
how
it
came
to
be
*NL*
agreed
among
us
that
I
was
to
seek
the
restoration
of
my
peace
in
change
*NL*
and
travel
,
I
do
not
,
even
now
,
distinctly
know
.
The
spirit
of
Agnes
so
*NL*
pervaded
all
we
thought
,
and
said
,
and
did
,
in
that
time
of
sorrow
,
that
*NL*
I
assume
I
may
refer
the
project
to
her
influence
.
But
her
influence
was
*NL*
so
quiet
that
I
know
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
indeed
,
I
began
to
think
that
in
my
old
association
of
her
with
*NL*
the
stained-glass
window
in
the
church
,
a
prophetic
foreshadowing
of
*NL*
what
she
would
be
to
me
,
in
the
calamity
that
was
to
happen
in
the
*NL*
fullness
of
time
,
had
found
a
way
into
my
mind
.
In
all
that
sorrow
,
from
*NL*
the
moment
,
never
to
be
forgotten
,
when
she
stood
before
me
with
her
*NL*
upraised
hand
,
she
was
like
a
sacred
presence
in
my
lonely
house
.
When
*NL*
the
Angel
of
Death
alighted
there
,
my
child-wife
fell
asleep
--
they
told
*NL*
me
so
when
I
could
bear
to
hear
it
--
on
her
bosom
,
with
a
smile
.
From
my
*NL*
swoon
,
I
first
awoke
to
a
consciousness
of
her
compassionate
tears
,
her
*NL*
words
of
hope
and
peace
,
her
gentle
face
bending
down
as
from
a
purer
*NL*
region
nearer
Heaven
,
over
my
undisciplined
heart
,
and
softening
its
*NL*
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
me
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
to
go
abroad
.
That
seemed
to
have
been
determined
among
us
from
*NL*
the
first
.
The
ground
now
covering
all
that
could
perish
of
my
departed
*NL*
wife
,
I
waited
only
for
what
Mr.
Micawber
called
the
``
final
*NL*
pulverisation
of
Heep
,
''
and
for
the
departure
of
the
emigrants
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
request
of
Traddles
,
most
affectionate
and
devoted
of
friends
in
*NL*
my
trouble
,
we
returned
to
Canterbury
:
I
mean
my
aunt
,
Agnes
,
and
I
.
We
*NL*
proceeded
by
appointment
straight
to
Mr.
Micawber
's
house
;
where
,
and
at
*NL*
Mr.
Wickfield
's
,
my
friend
had
been
labouring
ever
since
our
explosive
*NL*
meeting
.
When
poor
Mrs.
Micawber
saw
me
come
in
,
in
my
black
clothes
,
*NL*
she
was
sensibly
affected
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
good
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
's
heart
,
which
had
not
been
dunned
out
of
it
in
all
those
many
*NL*
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
,
''
was
my
aunt
's
first
salutation
after
we
*NL*
were
seated
.
``
Pray
,
have
you
thought
about
that
emigration
proposal
of
*NL*
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
madam
,
''
returned
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
perhaps
I
can
not
better
express
*NL*
the
conclusion
at
which
Mrs.
Micawber
,
your
humble
servant
,
and
I
may
*NL*
add
our
children
,
have
jointly
and
severally
arrived
,
than
by
borrowing
*NL*
the
language
of
an
illustrious
poet
,
to
reply
that
our
Boat
is
on
the
*NL*
shore
,
and
our
Bark
is
on
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
augur
all
sorts
of
good
from
your
*NL*
sensible
decision
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
you
do
us
a
great
deal
of
honor
,
''
he
rejoined
.
He
then
referred
*NL*
to
a
memorandum
.
``
With
respect
to
the
pecuniary
assistance
enabling
*NL*
us
to
launch
our
frail
canoe
on
the
ocean
of
enterprise
,
I
have
*NL*
reconsidered
that
important
business-point
;
and
would
beg
to
propose
*NL*
my
notes
of
hand
--
drawn
,
it
is
needless
to
stipulate
,
on
stamps
of
*NL*
the
amounts
respectively
required
by
the
various
Acts
of
Parliament
*NL*
applying
to
such
securities
--
at
eighteen
,
twenty-four
,
and
thirty
*NL*
months
.
The
proposition
I
originally
submitted
,
was
twelve
,
eighteen
,
*NL*
and
twenty-four
;
but
I
am
apprehensive
that
such
an
arrangement
might
*NL*
not
allow
sufficient
time
for
the
requisite
amount
of
--
Something
--
to
*NL*
turn
up
.
We
might
not
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
looking
round
the
room
as
if
*NL*
it
represented
several
hundred
acres
of
highly-cultivated
land
,
``
on
the
*NL*
first
responsibility
becoming
due
,
have
been
successful
in
our
harvest
,
*NL*
or
we
might
not
have
got
our
harvest
in
.
Labor
,
I
believe
,
is
sometimes
*NL*
difficult
to
obtain
in
that
portion
of
our
colonial
possessions
where
*NL*
it
will
be
our
lot
to
combat
with
the
teeming
soil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arrange
it
in
any
way
you
please
,
sir
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
he
replied
,
``
Mrs.
Micawber
and
myself
are
deeply
sensible
of
*NL*
the
very
considerate
kindness
of
our
friends
and
patrons

What
I
wish
*NL*
is
,
to
be
perfectly
business-like
,
and
perfectly
punctual
.
Turning
over
,
*NL*
as
we
are
about
to
turn
over
,
an
entirely
new
leaf
;
and
falling
back
,
as
*NL*
we
are
now
in
the
act
of
falling
back
,
for
a
Spring
of
no
common
*NL*
magnitude
;
it
is
important
to
my
sense
of
self-respect
,
besides
being
an
*NL*
example
to
my
son
,
that
these
arrangements
should
be
concluded
as
*NL*
between
man
and
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
that
Mr.
Micawber
attached
any
meaning
to
this
last
phrase
;
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
that
anybody
ever
does
,
or
did
;
but
he
appeared
to
relish
*NL*
it
uncommonly
,
and
repeated
,
with
an
impressive
cough
,
``
as
between
man
*NL*
and
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
propose
,

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
Bills
--
a
convenience
to
the
mercantile
*NL*
world
,
for
which
,
I
believe
,
we
are
originally
indebted
to
the
Jews
,
who
*NL*
appear
to
me
to
have
had
a
devilish
deal
too
much
to
do
with
them
ever
*NL*
since
--
because
they
are
negotiable
.
But
if
a
Bond
,
or
any
other
*NL*
description
of
security
,
would
be
preferred
,
I
should
be
happy
to
*NL*
execute
any
such
instrument

As

*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
observed
,
that
in
a
case
where
both
parties
were
willing
to
*NL*
agree
to
anything
,
she
took
it
for
granted
there
would
be
no
difficulty
*NL*
in
settling
this
point
.
Mr.
Micawber
was
of
her
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
reference
to
our
domestic
preparations

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
with
some
pride
,
``
for
meeting
the
destiny
to
which
we
are
now
understood
*NL*
to
be
self-devoted

I
beg

My
eldest
daughter
attends
at
*NL*
five
every
morning
in
a
neighbouring
establishment
,
to
acquire
the
*NL*
process
--
if
process
it
may
be
called
--
of
milking
cows
.
My
younger
*NL*
children
are
instructed
to
observe
,
as
closely
as
circumstances
will
*NL*
permit
,
the
habits
of
the
pigs
and
poultry
maintained
in
the
poorer
*NL*
parts
of
this
city
:
a
pursuit
from
which
they
have
,
on
two
occasions
,
*NL*
been
brought
home
,
within
an
inch
of
being
run
over
.
I
have
myself
*NL*
directed
some
attention
,
during
the
past
week
,
to
the
art
of
baking
;
and
*NL*
my
son
Wilkins
has
issued
forth
with
a
walking-stick
and
driven
cattle
,
*NL*
when
permitted
,
by
the
rugged
hirelings
who
had
them
in
charge
,
to
*NL*
render
any
voluntary
service
in
that
direction
--
which
I
regret
to
say
,
*NL*
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
,
was
not
often
;
he
being
generally
warned
,
*NL*
with
imprecations
,
to
desist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
very
right
indeed
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
encouragingly
.
``
Mrs.
Micawber
has
*NL*
been
busy
,
too
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
madam
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Micawber
,
with
her
business-like
air
,
``
I
*NL*
am
free
to
confess
,
that
I
have
not
been
actively
engaged
in
pursuits
*NL*
immediately
connected
with
cultivation
or
with
stock
,
though
well
aware
*NL*
that
both
will
claim
my
attention
on
a
foreign
shore
.
Such
opportunities
*NL*
as
I
have
been
enabled
to
alienate
from
my
domestic
duties
,
I
have
*NL*
devoted
to
corresponding
at
some
length
with
my
family
.
For
I
own
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
who
always
*NL*
fell
back
on
me
,
I
suppose
from
old
habit
,
to
whomsoever
else
she
might
*NL*
address
her
discourse
at
starting
,
``
that
the
time
is
come
when
the
past
*NL*
should
be
buried
in
oblivion
;
when
my
family
should
take
Mr.
Micawber
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
and
Mr.
Micawber
should
take
my
family
by
the
hand
;
when
the
*NL*
lion
should
lie
down
with
the
lamb
,
and
my
family
be
on
terms
with
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
thought
so
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
at
least
,
is
the
light
,
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
''
pursued
Mrs.
*NL*
Micawber
,
``
in
which
_
I
_
view
the
subject
.
When
I
lived
at
home
with
my
*NL*
papa
and
mama
,
my
papa
was
accustomed
to
ask
,
when
any
point
was
under
*NL*
discussion
in
our
limited
circle
,
`
In
what
light
does
my
Emma
view
the
*NL*
subject
?
'
That
my
papa
was
too
partial
,
I
know
;
still
,
on
such
a
point
*NL*
as
the
frigid
coldness
which
has
ever
subsisted
between
Mr.
Micawber
and
*NL*
my
family
,
I
necessarily
have
formed
an
opinion
,
delusive
though
it
may
*NL*
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
.
Of
course
you
have
,
ma'am
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
,
''
assented
Mrs.
Micawber
.
``
Now
,
I
may
be
wrong
in
my
*NL*
conclusions
;
it
is
very
likely
that
I
am
;
but
my
individual
impression
*NL*
is
,
that
the
gulf
between
my
family
and
Mr.
Micawber
may
be
traced
to
an
*NL*
apprehension
,
on
the
part
of
my
family
,
that
Mr.
Micawber
would
require
*NL*
pecuniary
accommodation
.
I
can
not
help
thinking
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
deep
sagacity
,
``
that
there
are
members
of
my
family
who
*NL*
have
been
apprehensive
that
Mr.
Micawber
would
solicit
them
for
their
*NL*
names
.
--
I
do
not
mean
to
be
conferred
in
Baptism
upon
our
children
,
but
*NL*
to
be
inscribed
on
Bills
of
Exchange
,
and
negotiated
in
the
Money
*NL*
Market
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
penetration
with
which
Mrs.
Micawber
announced
this
*NL*
discovery
,
as
if
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
it
before
,
seemed
rather
to
*NL*
astonish
my
aunt
;
who
abruptly
replied
,
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
*NL*
should
n't
wonder
if
you
were
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Micawber
being
now
on
the
eve
of
casting
off
the
pecuniary
shackles
*NL*
that
have
so
long
enthralled
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
and
of
*NL*
commencing
a
new
career
in
a
country
where
there
is
sufficient
range
for
*NL*
his
abilities
,
--
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
is
exceedingly
important
;
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
abilities
peculiarly
requiring
space
,
--
it
seems
to
me
that
my
*NL*
family
should
signalise
the
occasion
by
coming
forward
.
What
I
could
*NL*
wish
to
see
,
would
be
a
meeting
between
Mr.
Micawber
and
my
family
at
a
*NL*
festive
entertainment
,
to
be
given
at
my
family
's
expence
;
where
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
health
and
prosperity
being
proposed
,
by
some
leading
member
*NL*
of
my
family
,
Mr.
Micawber
might
have
an
opportunity
of
developing
his
*NL*
views

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear

''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
some
heat
,
``
it
may
be
better
for
me
*NL*
to
state
distinctly

at
once
,
that
if
I
were
to
develop
my
views
to
that
*NL*
assembled
group
,
they
would
possibly
be
found
of
an
offensive
nature
:
my
*NL*
impression
being
that
your
family
are
,
in
the
aggregate
,
impertinent
*NL*
Snobs
;
and
,
in
detail
,
unmitigated
Ruffians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Micawber

''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
shaking
her
head
,
``
no
!
You
have
never
*NL*
understood
them
,
and
they
have
never
understood
you

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
coughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
never
understood
you
,
Micawber
,
''
said
his
wife
.
``
They
may
be
*NL*
incapable
of
it
.
If
so
,
that
is
their
misfortune
.
I
can
pity
their
*NL*
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extremely
sorry
,
my
dear
Emma
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
relenting
,
``
to
*NL*
have
been
betrayed
into
any
expressions
that
might
,
even
remotely
,
have
*NL*
the
appearance
of
being
strong
expressions
.
All
I
would
say
,
is
,
that
I
*NL*
can
go
abroad
without
your
family
coming
forward
to
favor
me
,
--
in
short
,
*NL*
with
a
parting
Shove
of
their
cold
shoulders
;
and
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
*NL*
I
would
rather
leave
England
with
such
impetus
as
I
possess
,
than
derive
*NL*
any
acceleration
of
it
from
that
quarter
.
At
the
same
time
,
my
dear
,
if
*NL*
they
should
condescend
to
reply
to
your
communications
--
which
our
joint
*NL*
experience
renders
most
improbable
--
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
a
barrier
to
*NL*
your
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
matter
being
thus
amicably
settled
,
Mr.
Micawber
gave
Mrs.
Micawber
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
,
glancing
at
the
heap
of
books
and
papers
lying
before
*NL*
Traddles
on
the
table
,
said
they
would
leave
us
to
ourselves
;
which
they
*NL*
ceremoniously
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
said
Traddles
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
when
*NL*
they
were
gone
,
and
looking
at
me
with
an
affection
that
made
his
eyes
*NL*
red
,
and
his
hair
all
kinds
of
shapes
,
``
I
do
n't
make
any
excuse
for
*NL*
troubling
you
with
business
,
because
I
know
you
are
deeply
interested
in
*NL*
it
,
and
it
may
divert
your
thoughts
.
My
dear
boy
,
I
hope
you
are
not
*NL*
worn
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
myself
,
''
said
I
,
after
a
pause
.
``
We
have
more
cause
to
think
*NL*
of
my
aunt
than
of
any
one
.
You
know
how
much
she
has
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
surely

''
answered
Traddles
.
``
Who
can
forget
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
even
that
is
not
all
,

said
I.
``
During
the
last
fortnight
,
some
new
*NL*
trouble
has
vexed
her
;

she
has
been
in

out
of
London
every
day

*NL*
Several
times
she
has
gone
out
early
,

been
absent
until
evening

*NL*
Last
night
,
Traddles
,
with
this
journey
before
her
,
it
was
almost
*NL*
midnight
before
she
came
home

You
know
what
her
consideration
for
*NL*
others
is

She
will
not
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
distress
her

*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
very
pale
,
and
with
deep
lines
in
her
face
,
sat
immovable
until
*NL*
I
had
finished
;
when
some
stray
tears
found
their
way
to
her
cheeks
,
and
*NL*
she
put
her
hand
on
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing

it
's
nothing

There
will
be
no
more
of

You
*NL*
shall
know
by
and
by
.
Now
Agnes
,
my
dear
,
let
us
attend
to
these
*NL*
affairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
do
Mr.
Micawber
the
justice
to
say
,
''
Traddles
began
,
``
that
*NL*
although
he
would
appear
not
to
have
worked
to
any
good
account
for
*NL*
himself
,
he
is
a
most
untiring
man
when
he
works
for
other
people
.
I
*NL*
never
saw
such
a
fellow
.
If
he
always
goes
on
in
the
same
way
,
he
must
*NL*
be
,
virtually
,
about
two
hundred
years
old
,
at
present
.
The
heat
into
*NL*
which
he
has
been
continually
putting
himself
;
and
the
distracted
and
*NL*
impetuous
manner
in
which
he
has
been
diving
,
day
and
night
,
among
*NL*
papers
and
books
;
to
say
nothing
of
the
immense
number
of
letters
he
has
*NL*
written
me
between
this
house
and
Mr.
Wickfield
's
,
and
often
across
the
*NL*
table
when
he
has
been
sitting
opposite
,
and
might
much
more
easily
have
*NL*
spoken
;
is
quite
extraordinary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Letters
!
''
cried
my
aunt
.
``
I
believe
he
dreams
in
letters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Mr.
Dick
,
too
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
has
been
doing
wonders
!
As
soon
*NL*
as
he
was
released
from
overlooking
Uriah
Heep
,
whom
he
kept
in
such
*NL*
charge
as
_
I
_
never
saw
exceeded
,
he
began
to
devote
himself
to
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
.
And
really
his
anxiety
to
be
of
use
in
the
investigations
we
*NL*
have
been
making
,
and
his
real
usefulness
in
extracting
,
and
copying
,
*NL*
and
fetching
,
and
carrying
,
have
been
quite
stimulating
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick
is
a
very
remarkable
man
,
''
exclaimed
my
aunt
;
``
and
I
always
said
*NL*
he
was
.
Trot
,
you
know
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
to
say
,
Miss
Wickfield
,
''
pursued
Traddles
,
at
once
with
*NL*
great
delicacy
and
with
great
earnestness
,
``
that
in
your
absence
Mr.
*NL*
Wickfield
has
considerably
improved
.
Relieved
of
the
incubus
that
had
*NL*
fastened
upon
him
for
so
long
a
time
,
and
of
the
dreadful
apprehensions
*NL*
under
which
he
had
lived
,
he
is
hardly
the
same
person
.
At
times
,
even
*NL*
his
impaired
power
of
concentrating
his
memory
and
attention
on
*NL*
particular
points
of
business
,
has
recovered
itself
very
much
;
and
he
*NL*
has
been
able
to
assist
us
in
making
some
things
clear
,
that
we
should
*NL*
have
found
very
difficult
indeed
,
if
not
hopeless
,
without
him
.
But
,
*NL*
what
I
have
to
do
is
to
come
to
results
;
which
are
short
enough
;
not
to
*NL*
gossip
on
all
the
hopeful
circumstances
I
have
observed
,
or
I
shall
*NL*
never
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
natural
manner
and
agreeable
simplicity
made
it
transparent
that
he
*NL*
said
this
to
put
us
in
good
heart
,
and
to
enable
Agnes
to
hear
her
*NL*
father
mentioned
with
greater
confidence
;
but
it
was
not
the
less
*NL*
pleasant
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
let
me
see
,
''
said
Traddles
,
looking
among
the
papers
on
the
table
.
*NL*
``
Having
counted
our
funds
,
and
reduced
to
order
a
great
mass
of
*NL*
unintentional
confusion
in
the
first
place
,
and
of
wilful
confusion
and
*NL*
falsification
in
the
second
,
we
take
it
to
be
clear
that
Mr.
Wickfield
*NL*
might
now
wind
up
his
business
,
and
his
agency-trust
,
and
exhibit
no
*NL*
deficiency
or
defalcation
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
Heaven
!
''
cried
Agnes
,
fervently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
the
surplus
that
would
be
left
as
his
means
of
*NL*
support
--
and
I
suppose
the
house
to
be
sold
,
even
in
saying
this
--
would
*NL*
be
so
small
,
not
exceeding
in
all
probability
some
hundreds
of
pounds
,
*NL*
that
perhaps
,
Miss
Wickfield
,
it
would
be
best
to
consider
whether
he
*NL*
might
not
retain
his
agency
of
the
estate
to
which
he
has
so
long
been
*NL*
receiver

His
friends
might
advise
him

you
know

is
free

yourself

Copperfield

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
considered
it

Trotwood

said
Agnes
,
looking
to
me
,
``

I
feel
*NL*
that
it
ought
not
to
be

must
not
be

on
the
recommendation

*NL*
a
friend

I
am
so
grateful

owe
so
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not

that
I
recommend

observed
Traddles

I
think

suggest
it

No

I
am
happy
to
hear

say
so

answered
Agnes

steadily

hope

alike

papa
once
free
with
honor

could
I
wish
for

have
always
aspired

could
have
released
him
from
the
toils
in
*NL*
which
he
was
held

to
render
back
some
little
portion
of

been

for
years

*NL*
the
utmost
height
of
my
hopes

To
take
our
future
on
myself
,
will
be
*NL*
the
next
great
happiness

the
next
to
his
release
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

Often

The
calm

of
her

brought
back
so
vividly
,
first
the

itself
,
and
then
my
solitary
home
,
that
my
heart
was

full

Traddles
pretended
for
a
little
while
to
be
busily
*NL*
looking
among
the
papers

*NL*

sighed
my

*NL*
*NL*

It
was
originally

I

eight

said
*NL*
Traddles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Right

replied
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
account

said
Traddles

with
an
air
of
*NL*
perplexity

*NL*
*NL*

Traddles

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

all
there

my

I

lost

I
thought
it
wise
to

nothing

to
keep
it
secretly

she
had
wonderful
self-command

*NL*
*NL*

Then
I
am
delighted

cried
Traddles

beaming
with
joy

recovered
the
whole

*NL*

Do

exclaimed
my

``
How
so

*NL*

You

Traddles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

I
did

easily
silenced

not
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
indeed
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
it
was
sold

by
virtue
of
the
power

management
he
held
from
you
;
but
I
need
n't
say
by
whom
sold
,
or
on
whose
*NL*
actual
signature
.
It
was
afterwards
pretended
to
Mr.
Wickfield
,
by
that
*NL*
rascal
,
--
and
proved
,
too
,
by
figures

--
that
he
had
possessed
himself
of

on
general
instructions

_
said
-RRB-

keep
other

Mr.

,
being
so
*NL*
weak

helpless
in
his
hands

to
pay
you
,
afterwards
,
several
sums
*NL*
of
interest
on
a
pretended
principal
which
he
knew
did
not
exist

made
*NL*
himself

unhappily

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
at
last
took
the
blame
upon
himself

added
my

wrote
me
*NL*
a
mad
letter

charging
himself
with
robbery

wrong
unheard
of

Upon

which
I
paid
him
a
visit
early
one
morning

called
for
a
candle

burnt

the

told
him

right
me

himself

it

If
anybody
speaks
to

,
I
'll
leave

*NL*
*NL*
We
all
remained
quiet
;
Agnes
covering
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
after
a
pause
,
``
and
you
have
*NL*
really
extorted
the
money
back
from
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
''
returned
Traddles
,
``
Mr.
Micawber
had
so
completely
*NL*
hemmed
him
in
,
and
was
always
ready
with
so
many
new
points
if
an
old
*NL*
one
failed
,
that
he
could
not
escape
from
us
.
A
most
remarkable
*NL*
circumstance
is
,
that
I
really
do
n't
think
he
grasped
this
sum
even
so
*NL*
much
for
the
gratification
of
his
avarice
,
which
was
inordinate
,
as
in
*NL*
the
hatred
he
felt
for
Copperfield
.
He
said
so
to
me
,
plainly
.
He
said
*NL*
he
would
even
have
spent
as
much
,
to
baulk
or
injure
Copperfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
knitting
her
brows
thoughtfully
,
and
glancing
at
*NL*
Agnes
.
``
And
what
's
become
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
He
left
here
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
with
his
mother
,
who
had
*NL*
been
clamouring
,
and
beseeching
,
and
disclosing
,
the
whole
time

They
*NL*
went
away
by
one
of
the
London
night
coaches
,
and
I
know
no
more
about
*NL*
him
;
except
that
his
malevolence
to
me
at
parting
was
audacious
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
consider
himself
hardly
less
indebted
to
me
,
than
to
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
;
which
I
consider
-LRB-
as
I
told
him
-RRB-
quite
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
he
has
any
money
,
Traddles
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
I
should
think
so
,
''
he
replied
,
shaking
his
head
,
*NL*
seriously
.
``
I
should
say
he
must
have
pocketed
a
good
deal
,
in
one
way
*NL*
or
other
.
But
,
I
think
you
would
find
,
Copperfield
,
if
you
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
observing
his
course
,
that
money
would
never
keep
that
*NL*
man
out
of
mischief
.
He
is
such
an
incarnate
hypocrite
,
that
whatever
*NL*
object
he
pursues
,
he
must
pursue
crookedly
.
It
's
his
only
compensation
*NL*
for
the
outward
restraints
he
puts
upon
himself
.
Always
creeping
along
*NL*
the
ground
to
some
small
end
or
other
,
he
will
always
magnify
every
*NL*
object
in
the
way
;
and
consequently
will
hate
and
suspect
every
body
*NL*
that
comes
,
in
the
most
innocent
manner
,
between
him
and
it
.
So
,
the
*NL*
crooked
courses
will
become
crookeder
,
at
any
moment
,
for
the
least
*NL*
reason
,
or
for
none
.
It
's
only
necessary
to
consider
his
history
here
,
''
*NL*
said
Traddles
,
``
to
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
monster
of
meanness
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
observed
Traddles
thoughtfully
.
``
Many
*NL*
people
can
be
very
mean
,
when
they
give
their
minds
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
touching
Mr.
Micawber
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
really
,
''
said
Traddles
,
cheerfully
,
``
I
must
,
once
more
,
give
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
high
praise
.
But
for
his
having
been
so
patient
and
persevering
*NL*
for
so
long
a
time
,
we
never
could
have
hoped
to
do
anything
worth
*NL*
speaking
of
.
And
I
think
we
ought
to
consider
that
Mr.
Micawber
did
*NL*
right
,
for
right
's
sake
,
when
we
reflect
what
terms
he
might
have
made
*NL*
with
Uriah
Heep
himself
,
for
his
silence
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
would
you
give
him

inquired
my
aunt

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Before
you
come
to
that

said
Traddles
,
a
little
disconcerted
,
``
I
*NL*
am
afraid

thought
it
discreet
to
omit

being
able

carry

everything

me
-RRB-
two
points
,
in
making
this
lawless
adjustment

for
*NL*
it
's
perfectly
lawless
from
beginning
to

of
a
difficult
affair

*NL*
Those
I.
O.
U.

so
forth

Mr.

gave

advances
he
had

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
They
must
be
paid
,

said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
do
n't
know
when
they
may
be
proceeded
on
,
or
where
they
*NL*
are

''
rejoined
Traddles
,
opening
his
eyes
;
``
and
I
anticipate
,
that
,
*NL*
between
this
time
and
his
departure
,
Mr.
Micawber
will
be
constantly
*NL*
arrested
,
or
taken
in
execution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
must
be
constantly
set
free
again
,
and
taken
out
of
execution
,
''
*NL*
said
my
aunt
.
``
What
's
the
amount
altogether
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
Micawber
has
entered
the
transactions
--
he
calls
them
*NL*
transactions
--
with
great
form
,
in
a
book
,
''
rejoined
Traddles
,
smiling
;
*NL*
``
and
he
makes
the
amount
a
hundred
and
three
pounds
,
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
shall
we
give
him
,
that
sum
included
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
Agnes
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
you
and
I
can
talk
about
division
of
it
afterwards
.
What
should
*NL*
it
be
?
Five
hundred
pounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
,
Traddles
and
I
both
struck
in
at
once
.
We
both
recommended
a
*NL*
small
sum
in
money
,
and
the
payment
,
without
stipulation
to
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
,
of
the
Uriah
claims
as
they
came
in
.
We
proposed
that
the
*NL*
family
should
have
their
passage
and
their
outfit
,
and
a
hundred
pounds
;
*NL*
and
that
Mr.
Micawber
's
arrangement
for
the
repayment
of
the
advances
*NL*
should
be
gravely
entered
into
,
as
it
might
be
wholesome
for
him
to
*NL*
suppose
himself
under
that
responsibility
.
To
this
,
I
added
the
*NL*
suggestion
,
that
I
should
give
some
explanation
of
his
character
and
*NL*
history
to
Mr.
Peggotty
,
who
I
knew
could
be
relied
on
;
and
that
to
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
should
be
quietly
entrusted
the
discretion
of
advancing
another
*NL*
hundred
.
I
further
proposed
to
interest
Mr.
Micawber
in
Mr.
Peggotty
,
by
*NL*
confiding
so
much
of
Mr.
Peggotty
's
story
to
him
as
I
might
feel
*NL*
justified
in
relating
,
or
might
think
expedient
;
and
to
endeavour
to
*NL*
bring
each
of
them
to
bear
upon
the
other
,
for
the
common
advantage
.
We
*NL*
all
entered
warmly
into
these
views
;
and
I
may
mention
at
once
,
that
the
*NL*
principals
themselves
did
so
,
shortly
afterwards
,
with
perfect
good
will
*NL*
and
harmony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
Traddles
now
glanced
anxiously
at
my
aunt
again
,
I
reminded
*NL*
him
of
the
second
and
last
point
to
which
he
had
adverted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
and
your
aunt
will
excuse
me
,
Copperfield
,
if
I
touch
upon
a
*NL*
painful
theme
,
as
I
greatly
fear
I
shall
,
''
said
Traddles
,
hesitating
;
*NL*
``
but
I
think
it
necessary
to
bring
it
to
your
recollection
.
On
the
day
*NL*
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
memorable
denunciation
,
a
threatening
allusion
was
*NL*
made
by
Uriah
Heep
to
your
aunt
's
--
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
retaining
her
stiff
position
,
and
apparent
composure
,
assented
*NL*
with
a
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
observed
Traddles
,
``
it
was
mere
purposeless
impertinence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
--
pardon
me
--
really
such
a
person
,
and
at
all
in
his
power
?
''
*NL*
hinted
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
good
friend
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
,
with
a
perceptible
lengthening
of
his
face
,
explained
that
he
*NL*
had
not
been
able
to
approach
this
subject
;
that
it
had
shared
the
fate
*NL*
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
liabilities
,
in
not
being
comprehended
in
the
terms
he
*NL*
had
made
;
that
we
were
no
longer
of
any
authority
with
Uriah
Heep
;
and
*NL*
that
if
he
could
do
us
,
or
any
of
us
,
any
injury
or
annoyance
,
no
doubt
*NL*
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
remained
quiet
;
until
again
some
stray
tears
found
their
way
to
*NL*
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
right
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
was
very
thoughtful
to
mention
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
--
or
Copperfield
--
do
anything
?

asked
Traddles
,
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
thank
you
many
times

Trot

Mrs.
Micawber
back

And
do
n't

With
that
,
she
smoothed
her
dress
,
and
sat
,
with
her
*NL*
upright
carriage
,
looking
at
the
door

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mrs.
Micawber
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
when
they
entered
.
``
We
have
*NL*
been
discussing
your
emigration
,
with
many
apologies
to
you
for
keeping
*NL*
you
out
of
the
room
so
long
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
arrangements
we
*NL*
propose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
she
explained
,
to
the
unbounded
satisfaction
of
the
*NL*
family
,
--
children
and
all
being
then
present
,
--
and
so
much
to
the
*NL*
awakening
of
Mr.
Micawber
's
punctual
habits
in
the
opening
stage
of
*NL*
all
bill
transactions
,
that
he
could
not
be
dissuaded
from
immediately
*NL*
rushing
out
,
in
the
highest
spirits
,
to
buy
the
stamps
for
his
notes
of
*NL*
hand
.
But
,
his
joy
received
a
sudden
check
;
for
within
five
minutes
,
*NL*
he
returned
in
the
custody
of
a
sheriff
's
officer
,
informing
us
,
in
a
*NL*
flood
of
tears
,
that
all
was
lost
.
We
,
being
quite
prepared
for
this
*NL*
event
,
which
was
of
course
a
proceeding
of
Uriah
Heep
's
,
soon
paid
the
*NL*
money
;
and
in
five
minutes
more
Mr.
Micawber
was
seated
at
the
table
,
*NL*
filling
up
the
stamps
with
an
expression
of
perfect
joy
,
which
only
*NL*
that
congenial
employment
,
or
the
making
of
punch
,
could
impart
in
full
*NL*
completeness
to
his
shining
face
.
To
see
him
at
work
on
the
stamps
,
*NL*
with
the
relish
of
an
artist
,
touching
them
like
pictures
,
looking
*NL*
at
them
sideways
,
taking
weighty
notes
of
dates
and
amounts
in
his
*NL*
pocket-book
,
and
contemplating
them
when
finished
,
with
a
high
sense
of
*NL*
their
precious
value
,
was
a
sight
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
the
best
thing
you
can
do
,
sir
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
to
advise
you
,
''
*NL*
said
my
aunt
,
after
silently
observing
him
,
``
is
to
abjure
that
*NL*
occupation
for
evermore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
replied
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
it
is
my
intention
to
register
such
a
*NL*
vow
on
the
virgin
page
of
the
future
.
Mrs.
Micawber
will
attest
it
.
I
*NL*
trust
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
solemnly
,
``
that
my
son
Wilkins
will
ever
bear
*NL*
in
mind
,
that
he
had
infinitely
better
put
his
fist
in
the
fire
,
than
*NL*
use
it
to
handle
the
serpents
that
have
poisoned
the
life-blood
of
his
*NL*
unhappy
parent
!
''
Deeply
affected
,
and
changed
in
a
moment
to
the
image
*NL*
of
despair
,
Mr.
Micawber
regarded
the
serpents
with
a
look
of
gloomy
*NL*
abhorrence
-LRB-
in
which
his
late
admiration
of
them
was
not
quite
subdued
-RRB-
,
*NL*
folded
them
up
,
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
closed
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
.
We
were
weary
with
sorrow
*NL*
and
fatigue
,
and
my
aunt
and
I
were
to
return
to
London
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
It
was
arranged
that
the
Micawbers
should
follow
us
,
after
effecting
a
*NL*
sale
of
their
goods
to
a
broker
;
that
Mr.
Wickfield
's
affairs
should
be
*NL*
brought
to
a
settlement
,
with
all
convenient
speed
,
under
the
direction
*NL*
of
Traddles
;
and
that
Agnes
should
also
come
to
London
,
pending
those
*NL*
arrangements
.
We
passed
the
night
at
the
old
house
,
which
,
freed
from
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
Heeps
,
seemed
purged
of
a
disease
;
and
I
lay
in
my
*NL*
old
room
,
like
a
shipwrecked
wanderer
come
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
back
next
day
to
my
aunt
's
house
--
not
to
mine
;
and
when
she
and
*NL*
I
sat
alone
,
as
of
old
,
before
going
to
bed
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
do
you
really
wish
to
know
what
I
have
had
upon
my
mind
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do
,
aunt
.
If
there
ever
was
a
time
when
I
felt
unwilling
that
*NL*
you
should
have
a
sorrow
or
anxiety
which
I
could
not
share
,
it
is
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
sorrow
enough
,
child
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
affectionately
,
*NL*
``
without
the
addition
of
_
my
_
little
miseries
.
I
could
have
no
other
*NL*
motive
,
Trot
,
in
keeping
anything
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
well
,
''
said
I.
``
But
tell
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
ride
with
me
a
little
way
to-morrow
morning
?
''
asked
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
nine
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
then
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
,
accordingly
,
we
went
out
in
a
little
chariot
,
and
drove
to
*NL*
London
.
We
drove
a
long
way
through
the
streets
,
until
we
came
to
one
of
*NL*
the
large
hospitals
.
Standing
hard
by
the
building
was
a
plain
hearse
.
*NL*
The
driver
recognised
my
aunt
,
and
,
in
obedience
to
a
motion
of
her
hand
*NL*
at
the
window
,
drove
slowly
off
;
we
following
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
it
now
,
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
He
is
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
die
in
the
hospital
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
immovable
beside
me
;
but
,
again
I
saw
the
stray
tears
on
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
there
once
before
,
''
said
my
aunt
presently
.
``
He
was
ailing
a
*NL*
long
time
--
a
shattered
,
broken
man
,
these
many
years
.
When
he
knew
his
*NL*
state
in
this
last
illness
,
he
asked
them
to
send
for
me
.
He
was
sorry
*NL*
then
.
Very
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
went
,
I
know
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
.
I
was
with
him
a
good
deal
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
died
the
night
before
we
went
to
Canterbury
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
nodded
.
``
No
one
can
harm
him
now
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
was
a
vain
*NL*
threat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
drove
away
,
out
of
town
,
to
the
churchyard
at
Hornsey
.
``
Better
here
*NL*
than
in
the
streets
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
He
was
born
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
alighted
;
and
followed
the
plain
coffin
to
a
corner
I
remember
well
,
*NL*
where
the
service
was
read
consigning
it
to
the
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six-and-thirty
years
ago
,
this
day
,
my
dear
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
as
we
*NL*
walked
back
to
the
chariot
,
``
I
was
married
.
God
forgive
us
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
took
our
seats
in
silence
;
and
so
she
sat
beside
me
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
holding
my
hand
.
At
length
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
fine-looking
man
when
I
married
him
,
Trot
--
and
he
was
sadly
*NL*
changed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
last
long
.
After
the
relief
of
tears
,
she
soon
became
*NL*
composed
,
and
even
cheerful
.
Her
nerves
were
a
little
shaken
,
she
said
,
*NL*
or
she
would
not
have
given
way
to
it
.
God
forgive
us
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
rode
back
to
her
little
cottage
at
Highgate
,
where
we
found
the
*NL*
following
short
note
,
which
had
arrived
by
that
morning
's
post
from
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber

CHAPTER
LV
.
*NL*
*NL*
TEMPEST
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
approach
an
event
in
my
life
,
so
indelible
,
so
awful
,
so
bound
by
*NL*
an
infinite
variety
of
ties
to
all
that
has
preceded
it
,
in
these
pages
,
*NL*
that
,
from
the
beginning
of
my
narrative
,
I
have
seen
it
growing
larger
*NL*
and
larger
as
I
advanced
,
like
a
great
tower
in
a
plain
,
and
throwing
*NL*
its
fore-cast
shadow
even
on
the
incidents
of
my
childish
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
after
it
occurred
,
I
dreamed
of
it
often
.
I
have
started
up
so
*NL*
vividly
impressed
by
it
,
that
its
fury
has
yet
seemed
raging
in
my
quiet
*NL*
room
,
in
the
still
night
.
I
dream
of
it
sometimes
,
though
at
lengthened
*NL*
and
uncertain
intervals
,
to
this
hour
.
I
have
an
association
between
it
*NL*
and
a
stormy
wind
,
or
the
lightest
mention
of
a
sea-shore
,
as
strong
as
*NL*
any
of
which
my
mind
is
conscious
.
As
plainly
as
I
behold
what
happened
,
*NL*
I
will
try
to
write
it
down
.
I
do
not
recal
it
,
but
see
it
done
;
for
it
*NL*
happens
again
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
drawing
on
rapidly
for
the
sailing
of
the
emigrant-ship
,
my
*NL*
good
old
nurse
-LRB-
almost
broken-hearted
for
me
,
when
we
first
met
-RRB-
came
up
*NL*
to
London
.
I
was
constantly
with
her
,
and
her
brother
,
and
the
Micawbers
*NL*
-LRB-
they
being
very
much
together
-RRB-
;
but
Emily
I
never
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
the
time
was
close
at
hand
,
I
was
alone
with
Peggotty
*NL*
and
her
brother
.
Our
conversation
turned
on
Ham
.
She
described
to
us
how
*NL*
tenderly
he
had
taken
leave
of
her
,
and
how
manfully
and
quietly
he
had
*NL*
borne
himself
.
Most
of
all
,
of
late
,
when
she
believed
he
was
most
*NL*
tried
.
It
was
a
subject
of
which
the
affectionate
creature
never
tired
;
*NL*
and
our
interest
in
hearing
the
many
examples
which
she
,
who
was
so
much
*NL*
with
him
,
had
to
relate
,
was
equal
to
hers
in
relating
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
and
I
were
at
that
time
vacating
the
two
cottages
at
Highgate
;
I
*NL*
intending
to
go
abroad
,
and
she
to
return
to
her
house
at
Dover
.
We
had
*NL*
a
temporary
lodging
in
Covent
Garden
.
As
I
walked
home
to
it
,
after
this
*NL*
evening
's
conversation
,
reflecting
on
what
had
passed
between
Ham
and
*NL*
myself
when
I
was
last
at
Yarmouth
,
I
wavered
in
the
original
purpose
I
*NL*
had
formed
,
of
leaving
a
letter
for
Emily
when
I
should
take
leave
of
*NL*
her
uncle
on
board
the
ship
,
and
thought
it
would
be
better
to
write
to
*NL*
her
now
.
She
might
desire
,
I
thought
,
after
receiving
my
communication
,
*NL*
to
send
some
parting
word
by
me
to
her
unhappy
lover
.
I
ought
to
give
*NL*
her
the
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
therefore
sat
down
in
my
room
,
before
going
to
bed
,
and
wrote
to
her
.
*NL*
I
told
her
that
I
had
seen
him
,
and
that
he
had
requested
me
to
tell
her
*NL*
what
I
have
already
written
in
its
place
in
these
sheets
.
I
faithfully
*NL*
repeated
it
.
I
had
no
need
to
enlarge
upon
it
,
if
I
had
had
the
right
.
*NL*
Its
deep
fidelity
and
goodness
were
not
to
be
adorned
by
me
or
any
man
.
*NL*
I
left
it
out
,
to
be
sent
round
in
the
morning
;
with
a
line
to
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
,
requesting
him
to
give
it
to
her
;
and
went
to
bed
at
daybreak
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
weaker
than
I
knew
then
;
and
,
not
falling
asleep
until
the
sun
was
*NL*
up
,
lay
late
,
and
unrefreshed
,
next
day
.
I
was
roused
by
the
silent
*NL*
presence
of
my
aunt
at
my
bedside
.
I
felt
it
in
my
sleep
,
as
I
suppose
*NL*
we
all
do
feel
such
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
my
dear
,
''
she
said
,
when
I
opened
my
eyes
,
``
I
could
n't
make
up
my
*NL*
mind
to
disturb
you
.
Mr.
Peggotty
is
here
;
shall
he
come
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
yes
,
and
he
soon
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
said
,
when
we
had
shaken
hands
,
``
I
giv
Em
`
ly
your
*NL*
letter
,
sir
,
and
she
writ
this
heer
;
and
begged
of
me
fur
to
ask
you
to
*NL*
read
it
,
and
if
you
see
no
hurt
i
n't
,
to
be
so
kind
as
take
charge
*NL*
o
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
read
it
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
sorrowfully
.
I
opened
it
,
and
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
got
your
message
.
Oh
,
what
can
I
write
,
to
thank
you
for
*NL*
your
good
and
blessed
kindness
to
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
put
the
words
close
to
my
heart
.
I
shall
keep
them
till
*NL*
I
die
.
They
are
sharp
thorns
,
but
they
are
such
comfort
.
I
have
*NL*
prayed
over
them
,
oh
,
I
have
prayed
so
much
.
When
I
find
what
you
*NL*
are
,
and
what
uncle
is
,
I
think
what
God
must
be
,
and
can
cry
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
bye
for
ever
.
Now
,
my
dear
,
my
friend
,
good
bye
for
ever
in
*NL*
this
world
.
In
another
world
,
if
I
am
forgiven
,
I
may
wake
a
child
*NL*
and
come
to
you
.
All
thanks
and
blessings
.
Farewell
,
evermore
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
blotted
with
tears
,
was
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
tell
her
as
you
doe
n't
see
no
hurt
i
n't
,
and
as
you
'll
be
so
kind
*NL*
as
take
charge
o
n't
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
?
''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
when
I
had
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unquestionably
,
''
said
I
--
``
but
I
am
thinking
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
'll
go
down
again
to
Yarmouth
.
There
's
*NL*
time
,
and
to
spare
,
for
me
to
go
and
come
back
before
the
ship
sails
.
My
*NL*
mind
is
constantly
running
on
him
,
in
his
solitude
;
to
put
this
letter
*NL*
of
her
writing
in
his
hand
at
this
time
,
and
to
enable
you
to
tell
her
,
*NL*
in
the
moment
of
parting
,
that
he
has
got
it
,
will
be
a
kindness
to
both
*NL*
of
them
.
I
solemnly
accepted
his
commission
,
dear
good
fellow
,
and
*NL*
can
not
discharge
it
too
completely
.
The
journey
is
nothing
to
me
.
I
am
*NL*
restless
,
and
shall
be
better
in
motion
.
I
'll
go
down
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
anxiously
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
,
I
saw
that
he
was
of
my
*NL*
mind
;
and
this
,
if
I
had
required
to
be
confirmed
in
my
intention
,
would
*NL*
have
had
the
effect
.
He
went
round
to
the
coach-office
,
at
my
request
,
*NL*
and
took
the
box-seat
for
me
on
the
mail
.
In
the
evening
I
started
,
by
*NL*
that
conveyance
,
down
the
road
I
had
traversed
under
so
many
*NL*
vicissitudes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
that
,
''
I
asked
the
coachman
,
in
the
first
stage
out
of
*NL*
London
,
``
a
very
remarkable
sky
?
I
do
n't
remember
to
have
seen
one
like
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
--
not
equal
to
it
,
''
he
replied
.
``
That
's
wind
,
sir
.
There
'll
be
*NL*
mischief
done
at
sea
,
I
expect
,
before
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
murky
confusion
--
here
and
there
blotted
with
a
colour
like
the
*NL*
colour
of
the
smoke
from
damp
fuel
--
of
flying
clouds
,
tossed
up
into
*NL*
most
remarkable
heaps
,
suggesting
greater
heights
in
the
clouds
than
*NL*
there
were
depths
below
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
hollows
in
the
*NL*
earth
,
through
which
the
wild
moon
seemed
to
plunge
headlong
,
as
if
,
in
*NL*
a
dread
disturbance
of
the
laws
of
nature
,
she
had
lost
her
way
and
were
*NL*
frightened
.
There
had
been
a
wind
all
day
;
and
it
was
rising
then
,
with
*NL*
an
extraordinary
great
sound
.
In
another
hour
it
had
much
increased
,
and
*NL*
the
sky
was
more
overcast
,
and
it
blew
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
the
night
advanced
,
the
clouds
closing
in
and
densely
*NL*
overspreading
the
whole
sky
,
then
very
dark
,
it
came
on
to
blow
,
harder
*NL*
and
harder
.
It
still
increased
,
until
our
horses
could
scarcely
face
the
*NL*
wind
.
Many
times
,
in
the
dark
part
of
the
night
-LRB-
it
was
then
late
in
*NL*
September
,
when
the
nights
were
not
short
-RRB-
,
the
leaders
turned
about
,
or
*NL*
came
to
a
dead
stop
;
and
we
were
often
in
serious
apprehension
that
the
*NL*
coach
would
be
blown
over
.
Sweeping
gusts
of
rain
came
up
before
this
*NL*
storm
,
like
showers
of
steel
;
and
,
at
those
times
,
when
there
was
any
*NL*
shelter
of
trees
or
lee
walls
to
be
got
,
we
were
fain
to
stop
,
in
a
*NL*
sheer
impossibility
of
continuing
the
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
day
broke
,
it
blew
harder
and
harder
.
I
had
been
in
Yarmouth
*NL*
when
the
seamen
said
it
blew
great
guns
,
but
I
had
never
known
the
like
*NL*
of
this
,
or
anything
approaching
to
it
.
We
came
to
Ipswich
--
very
late
,
*NL*
having
had
to
fight
every
inch
of
ground
since
we
were
ten
miles
out
of
*NL*
London
;
and
found
a
cluster
of
people
in
the
market-place
,
who
had
risen
*NL*
from
their
beds
in
the
night
,
fearful
of
falling
chimneys
.
Some
of
*NL*
these
,
congregating
about
the
inn-yard
while
we
changed
horses
,
told
us
*NL*
of
great
sheets
of
lead
having
been
ripped
off
a
high
church-tower
,
and
*NL*
flung
into
a
bye
street
,
which
they
then
blocked
up
.
Others
had
to
tell
*NL*
of
country
people
,
coming
in
from
neighbouring
villages
,
who
had
seen
*NL*
great
trees
lying
torn
out
of
the
earth
,
and
whole
ricks
scattered
about
*NL*
the
roads
and
fields
.
Still
,
there
was
no
abatement
in
the
storm
,
but
it
*NL*
blew
harder
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
struggled
on
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
sea
,
from
which
this
mighty
*NL*
wind
was
blowing
dead
on
shore
,
its
force
became
more
and
more
terrific
.
*NL*
Long
before
we
saw
the
sea
,
its
spray
was
on
our
lips
,
and
showered
salt
*NL*
rain
upon
us
.
The
water
was
out
,
over
miles
and
miles
of
the
flat
*NL*
country
adjacent
to
Yarmouth
;
and
every
sheet
and
puddle
lashed
its
*NL*
banks
,
and
had
its
stress
of
little
breakers
setting
heavily
towards
us
.
*NL*
When
we
came
within
sight
of
the
sea
,
the
waves
on
the
horizon
,
caught
*NL*
at
intervals
above
the
rolling
abyss
,
were
like
glimpses
of
another
*NL*
shore
with
towers
and
buildings
.
When
at
last
we
got
into
the
town
,
the
*NL*
people
came
out
to
their
doors
,
all
aslant
,
and
with
streaming
hair
,
*NL*
making
a
wonder
of
the
mail
that
had
come
through
such
a
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
up
at
the
old
inn
,
and
went
down
to
look
at
the
sea
;
staggering
*NL*
along
the
street
,
which
was
strewn
with
sand
and
seaweed
,
and
with
*NL*
flying
blotches
of
sea-foam
;
afraid
of
falling
slates
and
tiles
;
and
*NL*
holding
by
people
I
met
,
at
angry
corners
.
Coming
near
the
beach
,
I
saw
,
*NL*
not
only
the
boatmen
,
but
half
the
people
of
the
town
,
lurking
behind
*NL*
buildings
;
some
,
now
and
then
braving
the
fury
of
the
storm
to
look
away
*NL*
to
sea
,
and
blown
sheer
out
of
their
course
in
trying
to
get
zigzag
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joining
these
groups
,
I
found
bewailing
women
whose
husbands
were
away
*NL*
in
herring
or
oyster
boats
,
which
there
was
too
much
reason
to
think
*NL*
might
have
foundered
before
they
could
run
in
anywhere
for
safety
.
*NL*
Grizzled
old
sailors
were
among
the
people
,
shaking
their
heads
,
as
they
*NL*
looked
from
water
to
sky
,
and
muttering
to
one
another
;
ship-owners
,
*NL*
excited
and
uneasy
;
children
,
huddling
together
,
and
peering
into
older
*NL*
faces
;
even
stout
mariners
,
disturbed
and
anxious
,
levelling
their
*NL*
glasses
at
the
sea
from
behind
places
of
shelter
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
surveying
an
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tremendous
sea
itself
,
when
I
could
find
sufficient
pause
to
look
at
*NL*
it
,
in
the
agitation
of
the
blinding
wind
,
the
flying
stones
and
sand
,
*NL*
and
the
awful
noise
,
confounded
me
.
As
the
high
watery
walls
came
*NL*
rolling
in
,
and
,
at
their
highest
,
tumbled
into
surf
,
they
looked
as
if
*NL*
the
least
would
engulf
the
town
.
As
the
receding
wave
swept
back
with
a
*NL*
hoarse
roar
,
it
seemed
to
scoop
out
deep
caves
in
the
beach
,
as
if
its
*NL*
purpose
were
to
undermine
the
earth
.
When
some
white-headed
billows
*NL*
thundered
on
,
and
dashed
themselves
to
pieces
before
they
reached
the
*NL*
land
,
every
fragment
of
the
late
whole
seemed
possessed
by
the
full
*NL*
might
of
its
wrath
,
rushing
to
be
gathered
to
the
composition
of
another
*NL*
monster
.
Undulating
hills
were
changed
to
valleys
,
undulating
valleys
*NL*
-LRB-
with
a
solitary
storm-bird
sometimes
skimming
through
them
-RRB-
were
lifted
*NL*
up
to
hills
;
masses
of
water
shivered
and
shook
the
beach
with
a
booming
*NL*
sound
;
every
shape
tumultuously
rolled
on
,
as
soon
as
made
,
to
change
*NL*
its
shape
and
place
,
and
beat
another
shape
and
place
away
;
the
ideal
*NL*
shore
on
the
horizon
,
with
its
towers
and
buildings
,
rose
and
fell
;
the
*NL*
clouds
flew
fast
and
thick
;
I
seemed
to
see
a
rending
and
upheaving
of
*NL*
all
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
finding
Ham
among
the
people
whom
this
memorable
wind
--
for
it
is
*NL*
still
remembered
down
there
,
as
the
greatest
ever
known
to
blow
upon
*NL*
that
coast
--
had
brought
together
,
I
made
my
way
to
his
house
.
It
was
*NL*
shut
;
and
as
no
one
answered
to
my
knocking
,
I
went
,
by
back
ways
and
*NL*
bye-lanes
,
to
the
yard
where
he
worked
.
I
learned
,
there
,
that
he
had
*NL*
gone
to
Lowestoft
,
to
meet
some
sudden
exigency
of
ship-repairing
in
*NL*
which
his
skill
was
required
;
but
that
he
would
be
back
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
,
in
good
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
back
to
the
inn
;
and
when
I
had
washed
and
dressed
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
sleep
,
but
in
vain
,
it
was
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
I
had
not
sat
*NL*
five
minutes
by
the
coffee-room
fire
,
when
the
waiter
,
coming
to
stir
*NL*
it
,
as
an
excuse
for
talking
,
told
me
that
two
colliers
had
gone
down
,
*NL*
with
all
hands
,
a
few
miles
away
;
and
that
some
other
ships
had
been
*NL*
seen
laboring
hard
in
the
Roads
,
and
trying
,
in
great
distress
,
to
keep
*NL*
off-shore
.
Mercy
on
them
,
and
on
all
poor
sailors
,
said
he
,
if
we
had
*NL*
another
night
like
the
last
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
depressed
in
spirits
;
very
solitary
;
and
felt
an
*NL*
uneasiness
in
Ham
's
not
being
there
,
disproportionate
to
the
occasion
.
I
*NL*
was
seriously
affected
,
without
knowing
how
much
,
by
late
events
;
and
my
*NL*
long
exposure
to
the
fierce
wind
had
confused
me
.
There
was
that
jumble
*NL*
in
my
thoughts
and
recollections
,
that
I
had
lost
the
clear
arrangement
*NL*
of
time
and
distance
.
Thus
,
if
I
had
gone
out
into
the
town
,
I
should
*NL*
not
have
been
surprised
,
I
think
,
to
encounter
some
one
who
I
knew
must
*NL*
be
then
in
London
.
So
to
speak
,
there
was
in
these
respects
a
curious
*NL*
inattention
in
my
mind
.
Yet
it
was
busy
,
too
,
with
all
the
remembrances
*NL*
the
place
naturally
awakened
;
and
they
were
particularly
distinct
and
*NL*
vivid
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
,
the
waiter
's
dismal
intelligence
about
the
ships
*NL*
immediately
connected
itself
,
without
any
effort
of
my
volition
,
with
my
*NL*
uneasiness
about
Ham
.
I
was
persuaded
that
I
had
an
apprehension
of
his
*NL*
returning
from
Lowestoft
by
sea
,
and
being
lost
.
This
grew
so
strong
*NL*
with
me
,
that
I
resolved
to
go
back
to
the
yard
before
I
took
my
dinner
,
*NL*
and
ask
the
boat-builder
if
he
thought
his
attempting
to
return
by
sea
*NL*
at
all
likely
?
If
he
gave
me
the
least
reason
to
think
so
,
I
would
go
*NL*
over
to
Lowestoft
and
prevent
it
by
bringing
him
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hastily
ordered
my
dinner
,
and
went
back
to
the
yard
.
I
was
none
too
*NL*
soon
;
for
the
boat-builder
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
was
locking
the
*NL*
yard-gate
.
He
quite
laughed
,
when
I
asked
him
the
question
,
and
said
*NL*
there
was
no
fear
;
no
man
in
his
senses
,
or
out
of
them
,
would
put
off
*NL*
in
such
a
gale
of
wind
,
least
of
all
Ham
Peggotty
,
who
had
been
born
to
*NL*
seafaring
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
sensible
of
this
,
beforehand
,
that
I
had
really
felt
ashamed
of
doing
*NL*
what
I
was
nevertheless
impelled
to
do
,
I
went
back
to
the
inn
.
If
such
*NL*
a
wind
could
rise
,
I
think
it
was
rising
.
The
howl
and
roar
,
the
*NL*
rattling
of
the
doors
and
windows
,
the
rumbling
in
the
chimneys
,
the
*NL*
apparent
rocking
of
the
very
house
that
sheltered
me
,
and
the
prodigious
*NL*
tumult
of
the
sea
,
were
more
fearful
than
in
the
morning
.
But
there
was
*NL*
now
a
great
darkness
besides
;
and
that
invested
the
storm
with
new
*NL*
terrors
,
real
and
fanciful
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
eat
,
I
could
not
sit
still
,
I
could
not
continue
stedfast
to
*NL*
anything
.
Something
within
me
,
faintly
answering
to
the
storm
without
,
*NL*
tossed
up
the
depths
of
my
memory
,
and
made
a
tumult
in
them
.
Yet
,
in
*NL*
all
the
hurry
of
my
thoughts
,
wild
running
with
the
thundering
sea
,
--
the
*NL*
storm
,
and
my
uneasiness
regarding
Ham
,
were
always
in
the
fore-ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dinner
went
away
almost
untasted
,
and
I
tried
to
refresh
myself
with
*NL*
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
.
In
vain
.
I
fell
into
a
dull
slumber
before
the
*NL*
fire
,
without
losing
my
consciousness
,
either
of
the
uproar
out
of
*NL*
doors
,
or
of
the
place
in
which
I
was
.
Both
became
overshadowed
by
a
new
*NL*
and
indefinable
horror
;
and
when
I
awoke
--
or
rather
when
I
shook
off
the
*NL*
lethargy
that
bound
me
in
my
chair
--
my
whole
frame
thrilled
with
*NL*
objectless
and
unintelligible
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
to
and
fro
,
tried
to
read
an
old
gazetteer
,
listened
to
the
*NL*
awful
noises
:
looked
at
faces
,
scenes
,
and
figures
in
the
fire
.
At
*NL*
length
,
the
steady
ticking
of
the
undisturbed
clock
on
the
wall
,
*NL*
tormented
me
to
that
degree
that
I
resolved
to
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
re-assuring
,
on
such
a
night
,
to
be
told
that
some
of
the
*NL*
inn-servants
had
agreed
together
to
sit
up
until
morning
.
I
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
exceedingly
weary
and
heavy
;
but
,
on
my
lying
down
,
all
such
*NL*
sensations
vanished
,
as
if
by
magic
,
and
I
was
broad
awake
,
with
every
*NL*
sense
refined
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
hours
I
lay
there
,
listening
to
the
wind
and
water
;
imagining
,
now
,
*NL*
that
I
heard
shrieks
out
at
sea
;
now
,
that
I
distinctly
heard
the
firing
*NL*
of
signal
guns
;
and
now
,
the
fall
of
houses
in
the
town
.
I
got
up
,
*NL*
several
times
,
and
looked
out
;
but
could
see
nothing
,
except
the
*NL*
reflection
in
the
window-panes
of
the
faint
candle
I
had
left
burning
,
*NL*
and
of
my
own
haggard
face
looking
in
at
me
from
the
black
void
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
my
restlessness
attained
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
I
hurried
on
*NL*
my
clothes
,
and
went
down
stairs
.
In
the
large
kitchen
,
where
I
dimly
*NL*
saw
bacon
and
ropes
of
onions
hanging
from
the
beams
,
the
watchers
were
*NL*
clustered
together
,
in
various
attitudes
,
about
a
table
,
purposely
moved
*NL*
away
from
the
great
chimney
,
and
brought
near
the
door
.
A
pretty
girl
,
*NL*
who
had
her
ears
stopped
with
her
apron
,
and
her
eyes
upon
the
door
,
*NL*
screamed
when
I
appeared
,
supposing
me
to
be
a
spirit
;
but
the
others
*NL*
had
more
presence
of
mind
,
and
were
glad
of
an
addition
to
their
*NL*
company
.
One
man
,
referring
to
the
topic
they
had
been
discussing
,
asked
*NL*
me
whether
I
thought
the
souls
of
the
collier-crews
who
had
gone
down
,
*NL*
were
out
in
the
storm
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
there
,
I
dare
say
,
two
hours
.
Once
,
I
opened
the
yard-gate
,
*NL*
and
looked
into
the
empty
street
.
The
sand
,
the
sea-weed
,
and
the
flakes
*NL*
of
foam
,
were
driving
by
;
and
I
was
obliged
to
call
for
assistance
*NL*
before
I
could
shut
the
gate
again
,
and
make
it
fast
against
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
dark
gloom
in
my
solitary
chamber
,
when
I
at
length
returned
*NL*
to
it
;
but
I
was
tired
now
,
and
,
getting
into
bed
again
,
fell
--
off
a
*NL*
tower
and
down
a
precipice
--
into
the
depths
of
sleep
.
I
have
an
*NL*
impression
that
for
a
long
time
,
though
I
dreamed
of
being
elsewhere
and
*NL*
in
a
variety
of
scenes
,
it
was
always
blowing
in
my
dream
.
At
length
,
I
*NL*
lost
that
feeble
hold
upon
reality
,
and
was
engaged
with
two
dear
*NL*
friends
,
but
who
they
were
I
do
n't
know
,
at
the
siege
of
some
town
in
a
*NL*
roar
of
cannonading
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thunder
of
the
cannon
was
so
loud
and
incessant
,
that
I
could
not
*NL*
hear
something
I
much
desired
to
hear
,
until
I
made
a
great
exertion
and
*NL*
awoke
.
It
was
broad
day
--
eight
or
nine
o'clock
;
the
storm
raging
,
in
*NL*
lieu
of
the
batteries
;
and
some
one
knocking
and
calling
at
my
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wreck
!
Close
by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sprung
out
of
bed
,
and
asked
what
wreck
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
schooner
,
from
Spain
or
Portugal
,
laden
with
fruit
and
wine
.
Make
*NL*
haste
,
sir
,
if
you
want
to
see
her
!
It
's
thought
,
down
on
the
beach
,
*NL*
she
'll
go
to
pieces
every
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
excited
voice
went
clamouring
along
the
staircase
;
and
I
wrapped
*NL*
myself
in
my
clothes
as
quickly
as
I
could
,
and
ran
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Numbers
of
people
were
there
before
me
,
all
running
in
one
direction
,
to
*NL*
the
beach
.
I
ran
the
same
way
,
outstripping
a
good
many
,
and
soon
came
*NL*
facing
the
wild
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
might
by
this
time
have
lulled
a
little
,
though
not
more
*NL*
sensibly
than
if
the
cannonading
I
had
dreamed
of
,
had
been
diminished
*NL*
by
the
silencing
of
half-a-dozen
guns
out
of
hundreds
.
But
,
the
sea
,
*NL*
having
upon
it
the
additional
agitation
of
the
whole
night
,
was
*NL*
infinitely
more
terrific
than
when
I
had
seen
it
last
.
Every
appearance
*NL*
it
had
then
presented
,
bore
the
expression
of
being
_
swelled
_
;
and
the
*NL*
height
to
which
the
breakers
rose
,
and
,
looking
over
one
another
,
bore
*NL*
one
another
down
,
and
rolled
in
,
in
interminable
hosts
,
was
most
*NL*
appalling
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
difficulty
of
hearing
anything
but
wind
and
waves
,
and
in
the
*NL*
crowd
,
and
the
unspeakable
confusion
,
and
my
first
breathless
efforts
to
*NL*
stand
against
the
weather
,
I
was
so
confused
that
I
looked
out
to
sea
*NL*
for
the
wreck
,
and
saw
nothing
but
the
foaming
heads
of
the
great
waves
.
*NL*
A
half-dressed
boatman
,
standing
next
me
,
pointed
with
his
bare
arm
-LRB-
a
*NL*
tattoo
'd
arrow
on
it
,
pointing
in
the
same
direction
-RRB-
to
the
left
.
Then
,
*NL*
O
great
Heaven
,
I
saw
it
,
close
in
upon
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
mast
was
broken
short
off
,
six
or
eight
feet
from
the
deck
,
and
lay
*NL*
over
the
side
,
entangled
in
a
maze
of
sail
and
rigging
;
and
all
that
*NL*
ruin
,
as
the
ship
rolled
and
beat
--
which
she
did
without
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
,
and
with
a
violence
quite
inconceivable
--
beat
the
side
as
if
it
*NL*
would
stave
it
in
.
Some
efforts
were
even
then
being
made
,
to
cut
this
*NL*
portion
of
the
wreck
away
;
for
,
as
the
ship
,
which
was
broadside
on
,
*NL*
turned
towards
us
in
her
rolling
,
I
plainly
descried
her
people
at
work
*NL*
with
axes
,
especially
one
active
figure
with
long
curling
hair
,
*NL*
conspicuous
among
the
rest
.
But
,
a
great
cry
,
which
was
audible
even
*NL*
above
the
wind
and
water
,
rose
from
the
shore
at
this
moment
;
the
sea
,
*NL*
sweeping
over
the
rolling
wreck
made
a
clean
breach
,
and
carried
men
,
*NL*
spars
,
casks
,
planks
,
bulwarks
,
heaps
of
such
toys
,
into
the
boiling
*NL*
surge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
mast
was
yet
standing
,
with
the
rags
of
a
rent
sail
,
and
a
*NL*
wild
confusion
of
broken
cordage
flapping
to
and
fro
.
The
ship
had
*NL*
struck
once
,
the
same
boatman
hoarsely
said
in
my
ear
,
and
then
lifted
*NL*
in
and
struck
again
.
I
understood
him
to
add
that
she
was
parting
*NL*
amidships
,
and
I
could
readily
suppose
so
,
for
the
rolling
and
beating
*NL*
were
too
tremendous
for
any
human
work
to
suffer
long
.
As
he
spoke
,
*NL*
there
was
another
great
cry
of
pity
from
the
beach
;
four
men
arose
with
*NL*
the
wreck
out
of
the
deep
,
clinging
to
the
rigging
of
the
remaining
*NL*
mast
;
uppermost
,
the
active
figure
with
the
curling
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bell
on
board
;
and
as
the
ship
rolled
and
dashed
,
like
a
*NL*
desperate
creature
driven
mad
,
now
showing
us
the
whole
sweep
of
her
*NL*
deck
,
as
she
turned
on
her
beam-ends
towards
the
shore
,
now
nothing
but
*NL*
her
keel
,
as
she
sprung
wildly
over
and
turned
towards
the
sea
,
the
bell
*NL*
rang
;
and
its
sound
,
the
knell
of
those
unhappy
men
,
was
borne
towards
*NL*
us
on
the
wind
.
Again
we
lost
her
,
and
again
she
rose
.
Two
men
were
*NL*
gone
.
The
agony
on
shore
increased
.
Men
groaned
,
and
clasped
their
*NL*
hands
;
women
shrieked
,
and
turned
away
their
faces
.
Some
ran
wildly
up
*NL*
and
down
along
the
beach
,
crying
for
help
where
no
help
could
be
.
I
*NL*
found
myself
one
of
these
,
frantically
imploring
a
knot
of
sailors
whom
*NL*
I
knew
,
not
to
let
those
two
lost
creatures
perish
before
our
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
making
out
to
me
,
in
an
agitated
way
--
I
do
n't
know
how
,
*NL*
for
the
little
I
could
hear
I
was
scarcely
composed
enough
to
*NL*
understand
--
that
the
life-boat
had
been
bravely
manned
an
hour
ago
,
*NL*
and
could
do
nothing
;
and
that
as
no
man
would
be
so
desperate
as
to
*NL*
attempt
to
wade
off
with
a
rope
,
and
establish
a
communication
with
*NL*
the
shore
,
there
was
nothing
left
to
try
;
when
I
noticed
that
some
new
*NL*
sensation
moved
the
people
on
the
beach
,
and
saw
them
part
,
and
Ham
*NL*
come
breaking
through
them
to
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
to
him
--
as
well
as
I
know
,
to
repeat
my
appeal
for
help
.
But
,
*NL*
distracted
though
I
was
,
by
a
sight
so
new
to
me
and
terrible
,
the
*NL*
determination
in
his
face
,
and
his
look
,
out
to
sea
--
exactly
the
same
*NL*
look
as
I
remembered
in
connexion
with
the
morning
after
Emily
's
*NL*
flight
--
awoke
me
to
a
knowledge
of
his
danger
.
I
held
him
back
with
*NL*
both
arms
;
and
implored
the
men
with
whom
I
had
been
speaking
,
not
to
*NL*
listen
to
him
,
not
to
do
murder
,
not
to
let
him
stir
from
off
that
sand
!
*NL*
*NL*
Another
cry
arose
on
shore
;
and
looking
to
the
wreck
,
we
saw
the
cruel
*NL*
sail
,
with
blow
on
blow
,
beat
off
the
lower
of
the
two
men
,
and
fly
up
*NL*
in
triumph
round
the
active
figure
left
alone
upon
the
mast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
such
a
sight
,
and
against
such
determination
as
that
of
the
*NL*
calmly
desperate
man
who
was
already
accustomed
to
lead
half
the
people
*NL*
present
,
I
might
as
hopefully
have
entreated
the
wind
.
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
cheerily
grasping
me
by
both
hands
,
``
if
my
time
is
come
,
't
is
*NL*
come
.
If
`
ta
n't
,
I
'll
bide
it
.
Lord
above
bless
you
,
and
bless
all
!
*NL*
Mates
,
make
me
ready
!
I
'm
a
going
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
swept
away
,
but
not
unkindly
,
to
some
distance
,
where
the
people
*NL*
around
me
made
me
stay
;
urging
,
as
I
confusedly
perceived
,
that
he
was
*NL*
bent
on
going
,
with
help
or
without
,
and
that
I
should
endanger
the
*NL*
precautions
for
his
safety
by
troubling
those
with
whom
they
rested
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
I
answered
,
or
what
they
rejoined
;
but
,
I
saw
hurry
on
*NL*
the
beach
,
and
men
running
with
ropes
from
a
capstan
that
was
there
,
and
*NL*
penetrating
into
a
circle
of
figures
that
hid
him
from
me
.
Then
,
I
saw
*NL*
him
standing
alone
,
in
a
seaman
's
frock
and
trowsers
:
a
rope
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
or
slung
to
his
wrist
:
another
round
his
body
:
and
several
of
the
*NL*
best
men
holding
,
at
a
little
distance
,
to
the
latter
,
which
he
laid
out
*NL*
himself
,
slack
upon
the
shore
,
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wreck
,
even
to
my
unpractised
eye
,
was
breaking
up
.
I
saw
that
she
*NL*
was
parting
in
the
middle
,
and
that
the
life
of
the
solitary
man
upon
*NL*
the
mast
hung
by
a
thread
.
Still
,
he
clung
to
it
.
He
had
a
singular
red
*NL*
cap
on
,
--
not
like
a
sailor
's
cap
,
but
of
a
finer
color
;
and
as
the
few
*NL*
yielding
planks
between
him
and
destruction
rolled
and
bulged
,
and
his
*NL*
anticipative
death-knell
rung
,
he
was
seen
by
all
of
us
to
wave
it
.
I
*NL*
saw
him
do
it
now
,
and
thought
I
was
going
distracted
,
when
his
action
*NL*
brought
an
old
remembrance
to
my
mind
of
a
once
dear
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ham
watched
the
sea
,
standing
alone
,
with
the
silence
of
suspended
*NL*
breath
behind
him
,
and
the
storm
before
,
until
there
was
a
great
*NL*
retiring
wave
,
when
,
with
a
backward
glance
at
those
who
held
the
rope
*NL*
which
was
made
fast
round
his
body
,
he
dashed
in
after
it
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
was
buffetting
with
the
water
;
rising
with
the
hills
,
falling
*NL*
with
the
valleys
,
lost
beneath
the
foam
;
then
drawn
again
to
land
.
They
*NL*
hauled
in
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
hurt
.
I
saw
blood
on
his
face
,
from
where
I
stood
;
but
he
took
no
*NL*
thought
of
that
.
He
seemed
hurriedly
to
give
them
some
directions
for
*NL*
leaving
him
more
free
--
or
so
I
judged
from
the
motion
of
his
arm
--
and
*NL*
was
gone
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
he
made
for
the
wreck
,
rising
with
the
hills
,
falling
with
the
*NL*
valleys
,
lost
beneath
the
rugged
foam
,
borne
in
towards
the
shore
,
borne
*NL*
on
towards
the
ship
,
striving
hard
and
valiantly
.
The
distance
was
*NL*
nothing
,
but
the
power
of
the
sea
and
wind
made
the
strife
deadly
.
At
*NL*
length
he
neared
the
wreck
.
He
was
so
near
,
that
with
one
more
of
his
*NL*
vigorous
strokes
he
would
be
clinging
to
it
,
--
when
,
a
high
,
green
,
vast
*NL*
hill-side
of
water
,
moving
on
shoreward
,
from
beyond
the
ship
,
he
seemed
*NL*
to
leap
up
into
it
with
a
mighty
bound
,
and
the
ship
was
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
eddying
fragments
I
saw
in
the
sea
,
as
if
a
mere
cask
had
been
*NL*
broken
,
in
running
to
the
spot
where
they
were
hauling
in
.
Consternation
*NL*
was
in
every
face
.
They
drew
him
to
my
very
feet
--
insensible
--
dead
.
He
*NL*
was
carried
to
the
nearest
house
;
and
,
no
one
preventing
me
now
,
I
*NL*
remained
near
him
,
busy
,
while
every
means
of
restoration
were
tried
;
*NL*
but
he
had
been
beaten
to
death
by
the
great
wave
,
and
his
generous
*NL*
heart
was
stilled
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
sat
beside
the
bed
,
when
hope
was
abandoned
and
all
was
done
,
a
*NL*
fisherman
,
who
had
known
me
when
Emily
and
I
were
children
,
and
ever
*NL*
since
,
whispered
my
name
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
with
tears
starting
to
his
weather-beaten
face
,
which
,
*NL*
with
his
trembling
lips
,
was
ashy
pale
,
``
will
you
come
over
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
remembrance
that
had
been
recalled
to
me
,
was
in
his
look
.
I
*NL*
asked
him
,
terror-stricken
,
leaning
on
the
arm
he
held
out
to
support
*NL*
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
a
body
come
ashore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
know
it
?
''
I
asked
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
he
led
me
to
the
shore
.
And
on
that
part
of
it
where
she
and
I
had
*NL*
looked
for
shells
,
two
children
--
on
that
part
of
it
where
some
lighter
*NL*
fragments
of
the
old
boat
,
blown
down
last
night
,
had
been
scattered
by
*NL*
the
wind
--
among
the
ruins
of
the
home
he
had
wronged
--
I
saw
him
lying
*NL*
with
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
as
I
had
often
seen
him
lie
at
school
.

CHAPTER
LVI

*NL*
*NL*
THE
NEW
WOUND
,
AND
THE
OLD
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
need
,
O
Steerforth
,
to
have
said
,
when
we
last
spoke
together
,
in
*NL*
that
hour
which
I
so
little
deemed
to
be
our
parting-hour
--
no
need
to
*NL*
have
said
,
``
Think
of
me
at
my
best
!
''
I
had
done
that
ever
;
and
could
I
*NL*
change
now
,
looking
on
this
sight
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
brought
a
hand-bier
,
and
laid
him
on
it
,
and
covered
him
with
a
*NL*
flag
,
and
took
him
up
and
bore
him
on
towards
the
houses
.
All
the
men
*NL*
who
carried
him
had
known
him
,
and
gone
sailing
with
him
,
and
seen
him
*NL*
merry
and
bold
.
They
carried
him
through
the
wild
roar
,
a
hush
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
all
the
tumult
;
and
took
him
to
the
cottage
where
Death
was
*NL*
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
when
they
set
the
bier
down
on
the
threshold
,
they
looked
at
one
*NL*
another
,
and
at
me
,
and
whispered
.
I
knew
why
.
They
felt
as
if
it
were
*NL*
not
right
to
lay
him
down
in
the
same
quiet
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
into
the
town
,
and
took
our
burden
to
the
inn
.
So
soon
as
I
*NL*
could
at
all
collect
my
thoughts
,
I
sent
for
Joram
,
and
begged
him
to
*NL*
provide
me
a
conveyance
in
which
it
could
be
got
to
London
in
the
night
.
*NL*
I
knew
that
the
care
of
it
,
and
the
hard
duty
of
preparing
his
mother
to
*NL*
receive
it
,
could
only
rest
with
me
;
and
I
was
anxious
to
discharge
that
*NL*
duty
as
faithfully
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
chose
the
night
for
the
journey
,
that
there
might
be
less
curiosity
*NL*
when
I
left
the
town
.
But
,
although
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
I
came
*NL*
out
of
the
yard
in
a
chaise
,
followed
by
what
I
had
in
charge
,
there
*NL*
were
many
people
waiting
.
At
intervals
,
along
the
town
,
and
even
a
*NL*
little
way
out
upon
the
road
,
I
saw
more
;
but
at
length
only
the
bleak
*NL*
night
and
the
open
country
were
around
me
,
and
the
ashes
of
my
youthful
*NL*
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
a
mellow
autumn
day
,
about
noon
,
when
the
ground
was
perfumed
by
*NL*
fallen
leaves
,
and
many
more
,
in
beautiful
tints
of
yellow
,
red
,
and
*NL*
brown
,
yet
hung
upon
the
trees
,
through
which
the
sun
was
shining
,
I
*NL*
arrived
at
Highgate
.
I
walked
the
last
mile
,
thinking
as
I
went
along
of
*NL*
what
I
had
to
do
;
and
left
the
carriage
that
had
followed
me
all
through
*NL*
the
night
,
awaiting
orders
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
,
when
I
came
up
to
it
,
looked
just
the
same
.
Not
a
blind
was
*NL*
raised
;
no
sign
of
life
was
in
the
dull
paved
court
,
with
its
covered
*NL*
way
leading
to
the
disused
door
.
The
wind
had
quite
gone
down
,
and
*NL*
nothing
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
,
at
first
,
the
courage
to
ring
at
the
gate
;
and
when
I
did
*NL*
ring
,
my
errand
seemed
to
me
to
be
expressed
in
the
very
sound
of
the
*NL*
bell
.
The
little
parlour-maid
came
out
,
with
the
key
in
her
hand
;
and
*NL*
looking
earnestly
at
me
as
she
unlocked
the
gate
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
Are
you
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
much
agitated
,
and
am
fatigued
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anything
the
matter
,
sir
?
--
Mr.
James
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
I.
``
Yes
,
something
has
happened
,
that
I
have
to
break
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
She
is
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
anxiously
replied
that
her
mistress
was
very
seldom
out
now
,
*NL*
even
in
a
carriage
;
that
she
kept
her
room
;
that
she
saw
no
company
,
but
*NL*
would
see
me
.
Her
mistress
was
up
,
she
said
,
and
Miss
Dartle
was
with
*NL*
her
.
What
message
should
she
take
up
stairs
?
*NL*
*NL*
Giving
her
a
strict
charge
to
be
careful
of
her
manner
,
and
only
to
*NL*
carry
in
my
card
and
say
I
waited
,
I
sat
down
in
the
drawing-room
-LRB-
which
*NL*
we
had
now
reached
-RRB-
until
she
should
come
back
.
Its
former
pleasant
air
*NL*
of
occupation
was
gone
,
and
the
shutters
were
half
closed
.
The
harp
had
*NL*
not
been
used
for
many
and
many
a
day
.
His
picture
,
as
a
boy
,
was
there
.
*NL*
The
cabinet
in
which
his
mother
had
kept
his
letters
was
there
.
I
*NL*
wondered
if
she
ever
read
them
now
;
if
she
would
ever
read
them
more
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
so
still
,
that
I
heard
the
girl
's
light
step
up
stairs
.
On
*NL*
her
return
,
she
brought
a
message
,
to
the
effect
that
Mrs.
Steerforth
*NL*
was
an
invalid
and
could
not
come
down
;
but
,
that
if
I
would
excuse
her
*NL*
being
in
her
chamber
,
she
would
be
glad
to
see
me
.
In
a
few
moments
I
*NL*
stood
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
his
room
;
not
in
her
own
.
I
felt
,
of
course
,
that
she
had
*NL*
taken
to
occupy
it
,
in
remembrance
of
him
;
and
that
the
many
tokens
of
*NL*
his
old
sports
and
accomplishments
,
by
which
she
was
surrounded
,
*NL*
remained
there
,
just
as
he
had
left
them
,
for
the
same
reason
.
She
*NL*
murmured
,
however
,
even
in
her
reception
of
me
,
that
she
was
out
of
her
*NL*
own
chamber
because
its
aspect
was
unsuited
to
her
infirmity
;
and
with
*NL*
her
stately
look
repelled
the
least
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
her
chair
,
as
usual
,
was
Rosa
Dartle
.
From
the
first
moment
of
her
*NL*
dark
eyes
resting
on
me
,
I
saw
she
knew
I
was
the
bearer
of
evil
*NL*
tidings
.
The
scar
sprung
into
view
that
instant
.
She
withdrew
herself
a
*NL*
step
behind
the
chair
,
to
keep
her
own
face
out
of
Mrs.
Steerforth
's
*NL*
observation
;
and
scrutinised
me
with
a
piercing
gaze
that
never
*NL*
faltered
,
never
shrunk
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
observe
you
are
in
mourning
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
unhappily
a
widower
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
young
to
know
so
great
a
loss
,
''
she
returned
.
``
I
am
*NL*
grieved
to
hear
it
.
I
am
grieved
to
hear
it
.
I
hope
Time
will
be
good
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Time

said
I
,
looking
at
her
,
``
will
be
good
to
all
of
us
.
Dear
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
we
must
all
trust
to
that
,
in
our
heaviest
*NL*
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
earnestness
of
my
manner
,
and
the
tears
in
my
eyes
,
alarmed
her
.
The
*NL*
whole
course
of
her
thoughts
appeared
to
stop
,
and
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
command
my
voice
in
gently
saying
his
name
,
but
it
trembled
.
*NL*
She
repeated
it
to
herself
,
two
or
three
times
,
in
a
low
tone
.
Then
,
*NL*
addressing
me
,
she
said
,
with
enforced
calmness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
is
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
reconciled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
say
Yes
,
I
could
not
say
No
.
She
slightly
turned
her
head
*NL*
towards
the
spot
where
Rosa
Dartle
had
been
standing
at
her
elbow
,
and
*NL*
in
that
moment
I
said
,
by
the
motion
of
my
lips
,
to
Rosa
``
Dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
Mrs.
Steerforth
might
not
be
induced
to
look
behind
her
,
and
read
,
*NL*
plainly
written
,
what
she
was
not
yet
prepared
to
know
,
I
met
her
look
*NL*
quickly
;
but
I
had
seen
Rosa
Dartle
throw
her
hands
up
in
the
air
with
*NL*
vehemence
of
despair
and
horror
,
and
then
clasp
them
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
lady
--
so
like
,
O
so
like
!
--
regarded
me
with
a
fixed
look
,
*NL*
and
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
.
I
besought
her
to
be
calm
,
and
prepare
*NL*
herself
to
bear
what
I
had
to
tell
;
but
I
should
rather
have
entreated
*NL*
her
to
weep
,
for
she
sat
like
a
stone
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
last
here

I
faltered
,
``
Miss

at
sea

If

were
at
sea
that
night
,
and
near
a
dangerous
coast
,
as
it
is
said
he
*NL*
was
;
and
if
the
vessel
that
was
seen
should
really
be
the
ship

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
said
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
came
,
but
with
no
sympathy
or
gentleness
.
Her
eyes
gleamed
like
fire
*NL*
as
she
confronted
his
mother
,
and
broke
into
a
frightful
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

she
said
,
``

appeased

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Steerforth
,
fallen
back
stiffly
in
her
chair
,
and
making
no
sound
*NL*
but
a
moan
,
cast
her
eyes
upon
her
with
a
wide
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
''
cried
Rosa
,
smiting
herself
passionately
on
the
breast
,
``
look
at

me

Moan

and
groan

and
look
at

striking
the
scar
,
``
at
*NL*
your

*NL*
*NL*
The
moan
the
mother
uttered
,
from
time
to
time
,
went
to
my
heart
.
Always
*NL*
the
same
.
Always
inarticulate
and
stifled
.
Always
accompanied
with
an
*NL*
incapable
motion
of
the
head
,
but
with
no
change
of
face
.
Always
*NL*
proceeding
from
a
rigid
mouth
and
closed
teeth
,
as
if
the
jaw
were
*NL*
locked
and
the
face
frozen
up
in
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
when
he
did
this
?
''
she
proceeded
.
``
Do
you
remember

when
,
in
his
inheritance
of
your
nature

in
your
pampering
of
his

pride

passion

he
did
this

disfigured
me
for
life

Look
at
me

marked
until
I
die
with
his
high
displeasure
;

*NL*
``
Miss

I
entreated
her

``
For

*NL*

Be

*NL*
*NL*
She
clenched
her
hand
,
and
trembled
through
her
spare
,
worn
figure
,
as
*NL*
if
her
passion
were
killing
her
by
inches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOU

she
exclaimed
.
``
You

grey

the
qualities
*NL*

made
both

gave

YOU

who
from
his
cradle
reared
*NL*
him
to
be
what
he
was

what
he

*NL*
*NL*

she
returned
,
``
I

will

speak
to
her

No
power
on

*NL*
should
stop
me
,
while
I
was
standing
here
!
Have
I
been
silent
all
these

years
,
and
shall
I
not
speak
now

I
loved

better

him

''
turning
on
her
fiercely
.
``
I
could
have
loved
him

and
asked
no

If

have
been
the
slave

Who

I

You
were
exacting

proud

punctilious

selfish

My
love

been
devoted

would
have
trod
your
paltry
whimpering

*NL*
*NL*
With
flashing
eyes
,
she
stamped
upon
the
ground
as
if
she
actually
did
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
!
''
she
said
,
striking
the
scar
again
,
with
a
relentless
hand
.
*NL*
``
When

grew
into
the
better
understanding

what
he

done

he
saw

it

of
it

I
could
sing

talk

show
*NL*
the
ardor

I
felt

attain
with
labor
to
such

attracted
him

When

Yes

he
did

Many
a

you
*NL*
were
put
off
with
a
slight
word
,
he
has
taken
Me
to
his
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
it
with
a
taunting
pride
in
the
midst
of
her
frenzy
--
for
it
was
*NL*
little
less
--
yet
with
an
eager
remembrance
of
it
,
in
which
the
*NL*
smouldering
embers
of
a
gentler
feeling
kindled
for
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
descended
--
as
I
might
have
known
I
should
,
but
that
he
fascinated
me
*NL*
with
his
boyish
courtship
--
into
a
doll
,
a
trifle
for
the
occupation
of
*NL*
an
idle
hour
,
to
be
dropped
,
and
taken
up
,
and
trifled
with
,
as
the
*NL*
inconstant
humour
took
him
.
When
he
grew
weary
,
I
grew
weary
.
As
his
*NL*
fancy
died
out
,
I
would
no
more
have
tried
to
strengthen
any
power
I
*NL*
had
,
than
I
would
have
married
him
on
his
being
forced
to
take
me
for
*NL*
his
wife
.
We
fell
away
from
one
another
without
a
word
.
Perhaps
you
saw
*NL*
it
,
and
were
not
sorry
.
Since
then
,
I
have
been
a
mere
disfigured
piece
*NL*
of
furniture
between
you
both
;
having
no
eyes
,
no
ears
,
no
feelings
,
no
*NL*
remembrances
.
Moan
?
Moan
for
what
you
made
him
;
not
for
your
love
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
that
the
time
was
,
when
I
loved
him
better
than
you
ever
did
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
with
her
bright
angry
eyes
confronting
the
wide
stare
,
and
the
*NL*
set
face
;
and
softened
no
more
,
when
the
moaning
was
repeated
,
than
if
*NL*
the
face
had
been
a
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dartle
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
you
can
be
so
obdurate

this
afflicted
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

''
she
sharply
retorted
.
``
She

sown
this

Let
her

*NL*
``
And

I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
she
cried
,
bursting
into
passionate
tears
.
``
Who

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

have

hold

,
''
I
replied
.
``
I
meant
to
say

if

have
no

compassion

or
if

have
been
bitter
on

them

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
false

she
cried
,
tearing
her
black
hair
;
``
I
loved
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
can
not
,
''
I
went
on
,
``
be
banished
from
your
remembrance
,
in
such
an
*NL*
hour
;
look
at
that
figure

even
as
one
you
have
never
seen
before
,
and
*NL*
render
it
some
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
the
figure
was
unchanged
,
and
looked
unchangeable
.
*NL*
Motionless
,
rigid
,
staring
;
moaning
in
the
same
dumb
way
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
with
the
same
helpless
motion
of
the
head
;
but
giving
no
other
*NL*
sign
of
life
.
Miss
Dartle
suddenly
kneeled
down
before
it
,
and
began
to
*NL*
loosen
the
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
curse
upon
you
!
''
she
said
,
looking
round
at
me
,
with
a
mingled
*NL*
expression
of
rage
and
grief
.
``
It
was
in
an
evil
hour
that
you
ever
came
*NL*
here
!
A
curse
upon
you
!
Go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
passing
out
of
the
room
,
I
hurried
back
to
ring
the
bell
,
the
*NL*
sooner
to
alarm
the
servants
.
She
had
then
taken
the
impassive
figure
in
*NL*
her
arms
,
and
,
still
upon
her
knees
,
was
weeping
over
it
,
kissing
it
,
*NL*
calling
to
it
,
rocking
it
to
and
fro
upon
her
bosom
like
a
child
,
and
*NL*
trying
every
tender
means
to
rouse
the
dormant
senses
.
No
longer
afraid
*NL*
of
leaving
her
,
I
noiselessly
turned
back
again
;
and
alarmed
the
house
*NL*
as
I
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
day
,
I
returned
,
and
we
laid
him
in
his
mother
's
room
.
She
*NL*
was
just
the
same
,
they
told
me
;
Miss
Dartle
never
left
her
;
doctors
*NL*
were
in
attendance
,
many
things
had
been
tried
;
but
she
lay
like
a
*NL*
statue
,
except
for
the
low
sound
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
through
the
dreary
house
,
and
darkened
the
windows
.
The
windows
*NL*
of
the
chamber
where
he
lay
,
I
darkened
last
.
I
lifted
up
the
leaden
*NL*
hand
,
and
held
it
to
my
heart
;
and
all
the
world
seemed
death
and
*NL*
silence
,
broken
only
by
his
mother
's
moaning
.

CHAPTER
LVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
THE
EMIGRANTS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
more
,
I
had
to
do
,
before
yielding
myself
to
the
shock
of
*NL*
these
emotions
.
It
was
,
to
conceal
what
had
occurred
,
from
those
who
*NL*
were
going
away
;
and
to
dismiss
them
on
their
voyage
in
happy
ignorance
.
*NL*
In
this
,
no
time
was
to
be
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
Mr.
Micawber
aside
that
same
night
,
and
confided
to
him
the
task
*NL*
of
standing
between
Mr.
Peggotty
and
intelligence
of
the
late
*NL*
catastrophe
.
He
zealously
undertook
to
do
so
,
and
to
intercept
any
*NL*
newspaper
through
which
it
might
,
without
such
precautions
,
reach
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
penetrates
to
him
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
striking
himself
on
*NL*
the
breast
,
``
it
shall
first
pass
through
this
body
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
,
I
must
observe
,
in
his
adaptation
of
himself
to
a
new
*NL*
state
of
society
,
had
acquired
a
bold
buccaneering
air
,
not
absolutely
*NL*
lawless
,
but
defensive
and
prompt
.
One
might
have
supposed
him
a
child
*NL*
of
the
wilderness
,
long
accustomed
to
live
out
of
the
confines
of
*NL*
civilisation
,
and
about
to
return
to
his
native
wilds
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
provided
himself
,
among
other
things
,
with
a
complete
suit
of
*NL*
oil-skin
,
and
a
straw-hat
with
a
very
low
crown
,
pitched
or
caulked
on
*NL*
the
outside
.
In
this
rough
clothing
,
with
a
common
mariner
's
telescope
*NL*
under
his
arm
,
and
a
shrewd
trick
of
casting
up
his
eye
at
the
sky
as
*NL*
looking
out
for
dirty
weather
,
he
was
far
more
nautical
,
after
his
*NL*
manner
,
than
Mr.
Peggotty
.
His
whole
family
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
*NL*
were
cleared
for
action
.
I
found
Mrs.
Micawber
in
the
closest
and
most
*NL*
uncompromising
of
bonnets
,
made
fast
under
the
chin
;
and
in
a
shawl
*NL*
which
tied
her
up
-LRB-
as
I
had
been
tied
up
,
when
my
aunt
first
received
*NL*
me
-RRB-
like
a
bundle
,
and
was
secured
behind
at
the
waist
,
in
a
strong
*NL*
knot
.
Miss
Micawber
I
found
made
snug
for
stormy
weather
,
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
;
with
nothing
superfluous
about
her
.
Master
Micawber
was
hardly
*NL*
visible
in
a
Guernsey
shirt
,
and
the
shaggiest
suit
of
slops
I
ever
saw
;
*NL*
and
the
children
were
done
up
,
like
preserved
meats
,
in
impervious
*NL*
cases
.
Both
Mr.
Micawber
and
his
eldest
son
wore
their
sleeves
loosely
*NL*
turned
back
at
the
wrists
,
as
being
ready
to
lend
a
hand
in
any
*NL*
direction
,
and
to
``
tumble
up
,
''
or
sing
out
,
``
Yeo
--
Heave
--
Yeo
!
''
on
the
*NL*
shortest
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Traddles
and
I
found
them
at
nightfall
,
assembled
on
the
wooden
*NL*
steps
,
at
that
time
known
as
Hungerford
Stairs
,
watching
the
departure
*NL*
of
a
boat
with
some
of
their
property
on
board
.
I
had
told
Traddles
of
*NL*
the
terrible
event
,
and
it
had
greatly
shocked
him
;
but
there
could
be
*NL*
no
doubt
of
the
kindness
of
keeping
it
a
secret
,
and
he
had
come
to
help
*NL*
me
in
this
last
service
.
It
was
here
that
I
took
Mr.
Micawber
aside
,
and
*NL*
received
his
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Micawber
family
were
lodged
in
a
little
,
dirty
,
tumble-down
*NL*
public-house
,
which
in
those
days
was
close
to
the
stairs
,
and
whose
*NL*
protruding
wooden
rooms
overhung
the
river
.
The
family
,
as
emigrants
,
*NL*
being
objects
of
some
interest
in
and
about
Hungerford
,
attracted
so
*NL*
many
beholders
,
that
we
were
glad
to
take
refuge
in
their
room
.
It
was
*NL*
one
of
the
wooden
chambers
up-stairs
,
with
the
tide
flowing
underneath
.
*NL*
My
aunt
and
Agnes
were
there
,
busily
making
some
little
extra
comforts
,
*NL*
in
the
way
of
dress
,
for
the
children
.
Peggotty
was
quietly
assisting
,
*NL*
with
the
old
insensible
work-box
,
yard
measure
,
and
bit
of
wax-candle
*NL*
before
her
,
that
had
now
outlived
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
easy
to
answer
her
inquiries
;
still
less
to
whisper
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
,
when
Mr.
Micawber
brought
him
in
,
that
I
had
given
the
letter
,
*NL*
and
all
was
well
.
But
I
did
both
,
and
made
them
happy
.
If
I
showed
any
*NL*
trace
of
what
I
felt
,
my
own
sorrows
were
sufficient
to
account
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
does
the
ship
sail
,
Mr.
Micawber
?
''
asked
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
considered
it
necessary
to
prepare
either
my
aunt
or
his
*NL*
wife
,
by
degrees
,
and
said
,
sooner
than
he
had
expected
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
boat
brought
you
word
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
,
ma'am
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
And
she
sails
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
he
replied
,
``
I
am
informed
that
we
must
positively
be
on
board
*NL*
before
seven
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyday
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
that
's
soon
.
Is
it
a
sea-going
fact
,
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
so
,
ma'am
.
She
'll
drop
down
the
river
with
that

tide
.
If

Mas

r
Davy
and
my
sister
comes
aboard
at
Gravesen

,
arternoon
o

next
*NL*
day
,

'll
see
the
last
on
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
we
shall
do
,
''
said
I
,
``
be
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
then
,
and
until
we
are
at
sea
,
''
observed
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
a
*NL*
glance
of
intelligence
at
me
,
``
Mr.
Peggotty
and
myself
will
constantly
*NL*
keep
a
double
look-out
together
,
on
our
goods
and
chattels
.
Emma
,
my
*NL*
love
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
clearing
his
throat
in
his
magnificent
way
,
*NL*
``
my
friend
Mr.
Thomas
Traddles
is
so
obliging
as
to
solicit
,
in
my
ear
,
*NL*
that
he
should
have
the
privilege
of
ordering
the
ingredients
necessary

to
the
composition
of

moderate
portion
of

is
*NL*
peculiarly
associated
,
in
our
minds
,
with
the
Roast
Beef
of
old
England
.
*NL*
I
allude
to
--
in
short
,
Punch
.
Under
ordinary
circumstances
,
I
should
*NL*
scruple
to
entreat
the
indulgence
of
Miss
Trotwood
and
Miss
Wickfield
,
*NL*
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
say
for
myself
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
that
I
will
drink
all
*NL*
happiness
and
success
to
you
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
the
utmost
pleasure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
too
!
''
said
Agnes
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
immediately
descended
to
the
bar
,
where
he
appeared
to
*NL*
be
quite
at
home
;
and
in
due
time
returned
with
a
steaming
jug
.
I
*NL*
could
not
but
observe
that
he
had
been
peeling
the
lemons
with
his
own
*NL*
clasp-knife
,
which
,
as
became
the
knife
of
a
practical
settler
,
was
*NL*
about
a
foot
long
;
and
which
he
wiped
,
not
wholly
without
ostentation
,
*NL*
on
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
.
Mrs.
Micawber
and
the
two
elder
members
*NL*
of
the
family
I
now
found
to
be
provided
with
similar
formidable
*NL*
instruments
,
while
every
child
had
its
own
wooden
spoon
attached
to
its
*NL*
body
by
a
strong
line
.
In
a
similar
anticipation
of
life
afloat
,
and
in
*NL*
the
Bush
,
Mr.
Micawber
,
instead
of
helping
Mrs.
Micawber
and
his
eldest
*NL*
son
and
daughter
to
punch
,
in
wine-glasses
,
which
he
might
easily
have
*NL*
done
,
for
there
was
a
shelf-full
in
the
room
,
served
it
out
to
them
*NL*
in
a
series
of
villainous
little
tin
pots
;
and
I
never
saw
him
enjoy
*NL*
anything
so
much
as
drinking
out
of
his
own
particular
pint
pot
,
and
*NL*
putting
it
in
his
pocket
at
the
close
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
luxuries
of
the
old
country
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
an
intense
*NL*
satisfaction
in
their
renouncement
,
``
we
abandon
.
The
denizens
of
the

forest
can
not

refinements
of

the
land
of

Free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
a
boy
came
in
to
say
that
Mr.
Micawber
was
wanted
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
presentiment
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
setting
down
her
tin
pot
,
*NL*
``
that
it
is
a
member
of
my
family
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
my
dear

''
observed
Mr.
Micawber
,
with
his
usual
suddenness
of
*NL*
warmth
on
that
subject
,
``
as
the
member
of
your

whoever
he

it

may
be

may
now
wait

convenience

*NL*
*NL*
``
Micawber

said
his

,
in
a
low
tone
,
``
at
such
a

this

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
is
not

''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
rising
,
''
`
that
every
nice
offence
*NL*
should
bear
its
comment

Emma
,
I
stand
reproved

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

observed
his

been

to
which
*NL*
their

conduct
has
,
in

exposed

now
desire

extend

it
not

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
returned
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
his

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emma
,
''
he
returned
,
``
that
view
of
the
question
is
,
at
such
a
moment

*NL*
irresistible

I
can
not
,
even
now
,
distinctly
pledge
myself
to
fall
upon
*NL*
your
family
's
neck
;
but
the
member
of
your
family
,
who
is
now
in
*NL*
attendance
,
shall
have
no
genial
warmth
frozen
by
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
withdrew
,
and
was
absent
some
little
time
;
in
the
course
*NL*
of
which
Mrs.
Micawber
was
not
wholly
free
from
an
apprehension
that
*NL*
words
might
have
arisen
between
him
and
the
Member
.
At
length
the
same
*NL*
boy
re-appeared
,
and
presented
me
with
a
note
written
in
pencil
,
and
*NL*
headed
,
in
a
legal
manner
,
``
Heep
v.
Micawber
.
''
From
this
document
,
*NL*
I
learned
that
Mr.
Micawber
,
being
again
arrested
,
was
in
a
final
*NL*
paroxysm
of
despair
;
and
that
he
begged
me
to
send
him
his
knife
and
*NL*
pint
pot
,
by
bearer
,
as
they
might
prove
serviceable
during
the
brief
*NL*
remainder
of
his
existence
,
in
jail
.
He
also
requested
,
as
a
last
act
*NL*
of
friendship
,
that
I
would
see
his
family
to
the
Parish
Workhouse
,
and
*NL*
forget
that
such
a
Being
ever
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
answered
this
note
by
going
down
with
the
boy
to
pay
the
*NL*
money
,
where
I
found
Mr.
Micawber
sitting
in
a
corner
,
looking
darkly
at
*NL*
the
Sheriff
's
Officer
who
had
effected
the
capture
.
On
his
release
,
he
*NL*
embraced
me
with
the
utmost
fervor
;
and
made
an
entry
of
the
transaction
*NL*
in
his
pocket-book
--
being
very
particular
,
I
recollect
,
about
a
*NL*
halfpenny
I
inadvertently
omitted
from
my
statement
of
the
total
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
momentous
pocket-book
was
a
timely
reminder
to
him
of
another
*NL*
transaction
.
On
our
return
to
the
room
upstairs
-LRB-
where
he
accounted
for
*NL*
his
absence
by
saying
that
it
had
been
occasioned
by
circumstances
over
*NL*
which
he
had
no
control
-RRB-
,
he
took
out
of
it
a
large
sheet
of
paper
,
*NL*
folded
small
,
and
quite
covered
with
long
sums
,
carefully
worked
.
From
*NL*
the
glimpse
I
had
of
them
,
I
should
say
that
I
never
saw
such
sums
out
*NL*
of
a
school
cyphering-book
.
These
,
it
seemed
,
were
calculations
of
*NL*
compound
interest
on
what
he
called
``
the
principal
amount
of
forty-one
,
*NL*
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
,
''
for
various
periods
.
After
a
careful
*NL*
consideration
of
these
,
and
an
elaborate
estimate
of
his
resources
,
he
*NL*
had
come
to
the
conclusion
to
select
that
sum
which
represented
the
*NL*
amount
with
compound
interest
to
two
years
,
fifteen
calendar
months
,
and
*NL*
fourteen
days
,
from
that
date
.
For
this
he
had
drawn
a
note
of-hand
with
*NL*
great
neatness
,
which
he
handed
over
to
Traddles
on
the
spot
,
a
*NL*
discharge
of
his
debt
in
full
-LRB-
as
between
man
and
man
-RRB-
,
with
many
*NL*
acknowledgments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
still
a
presentiment
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
pensively
shaking
her
*NL*
head
,
``
that
my
family
will
appear
on
board
,
before
we
finally
depart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
evidently
had
his
presentiment
on
the
subject
too
,
but
he
*NL*
put
it
in
his
tin
pot
and
swallowed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
any
opportunity
of
sending
letters
home
,
on
your
passage
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
you
must
let
us
hear
from
you
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Trotwood
,
''
she
replied
,
``
I
shall
only
be
too
happy
to
*NL*
think
that
anyone
expects
to
hear
from
us
.
I
shall
not
fail
to
*NL*
correspond
.
Mr.
Copperfield
,
I
trust
,
as
an
old
and
familiar
friend
,
*NL*
will
not
object
to
receive
occasional
intelligence
,
himself
,
from
one
*NL*
who
knew
him
when
the
twins
were
yet
unconscious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
that
I
should
hope
to
hear
,
whenever
she
had
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
Heaven
,
there
will
be
many
such
opportunities
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
.
``
The
ocean
,
in
these
times
,
is
a
perfect
fleet
of
ships
;
and
*NL*
we
can
hardly
fail
to
encounter
many
,
in
running
over
.
It
is
merely
*NL*
crossing
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
trifling
with
his
eye-glass
,
``
merely
*NL*
crossing
.
The
distance
is
quite
imaginary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
,
now
,
how
odd
it
was
,
but
how
wonderfully
like
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
that
,
when
he
went
from
London
to
Canterbury
,
he
should
have
talked
as
*NL*
if
he
were
going
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
earth
;
and
,
when
he
went
*NL*
from
England
to
Australia
,
as
if
he
were
going
for
a
little
trip
across
*NL*
the
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
voyage
,
I
shall
endeavour
,
''
said
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
occasionally
*NL*
to
spin
them
a
yarn
;
and
the
melody
of
my
son
Wilkins
will
,
I
*NL*
trust
,
be
acceptable
at
the
galley-fire
.
When
Mrs.
Micawber
has
her
*NL*
sea-legs
on
--
an
expression
in
which
I
hope
there
is
no
conventional
*NL*
impropriety

she
will
give
them

I
dare
say
,
Little
Tafflin

Porpoises
*NL*
and
dolphins

I
believe
,
will
be
frequently
observed
athwart
our
Bows

and
,
either
on
the
Starboard
or
the
Larboard
Quarter
,
objects
of
*NL*
interest
will
be
continually
descried
.
In
short
,

said
Mr.
Micawber
,
*NL*
with
the
old
genteel
air
,
``
the
probability
is
,
all
will
be
found
so
*NL*
exciting

stationed
in

main-top

cries

shall
be
very
considerably
astonished

*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
flourished
off
the
contents
of
his
little
tin
pot
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
made
the
voyage

and
had
passed
a
first-class
examination
before
the

highest
naval
authorities

Mr.

sat
in

eyebrows
raised

half

receiving

half
repudiating
Mrs.

stated

very
sensible

*NL*
my
dear
Mr.
Copperfield
,
appears
to
me
to
be
his
true
position
.
From
the
*NL*
first
moment
of
this
voyage
,
I
wish
Mr.
Micawber
to
stand
upon
that
*NL*
vessel
's
prow
and
say
,
`
Enough
of
delay
:
enough
of
disappointment
:
*NL*
enough
of
limited
means
.
That
was
in
the
old
country
.
This
is
the
new
.
*NL*
Produce
your
reparation
.
Bring
it
forward
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
folded
his
arms
,
in
a
resolute
manner
,
as
if
he
were
then
*NL*
stationed
on
the
figure-head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
doing
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
''
--
feeling
his
position
--
am
I
not
*NL*
right
in
saying
that
Mr.
Micawber
will
strengthen
,
and
not
weaken
,
his
*NL*
connexion
with
Britain
?
An
important
public
character
arising
in
that
*NL*
hemisphere
,
shall
I
be
told
that
its
influence
will
not
be
felt
at
home
?
*NL*
Can
I
be
so
weak
as
to
imagine
that
Mr.
Micawber
,
wielding
the
rod
of
*NL*
talent
and
of
power
in
Australia
,
will
be
nothing
in
England
?
I
am
but
a
*NL*
woman
;
but
I
should
be
unworthy
of
myself
,
and
of
my
papa
,
if
I
were
*NL*
guilty
of
such
absurd
weakness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Micawber
's
conviction
that
her
arguments
were
unanswerable
,
gave
a
*NL*
moral
elevation
to
her
tone
which
I
think
I
had
never
heard
in
it
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
therefore
it
is
,
''
said
Mrs.
Micawber
,
``
that
I
the
more
wish
,
that
,
*NL*
at
a
future
period
,
we
may
live
again
on
the
parent
soil
.
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
may
be
--
I
can
not
disguise
from
myself
that
the
probability
is
,
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
will
be
--
a
page
of
History
;
and
he
ought
then
to
be
represented
*NL*
in
the
country
which
gave
him
birth
,
and
did
_
not
_
give
him
employment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
observed
Mr.
Micawber
,
``
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
be
*NL*
touched
by
your
affection
.
I
am
always
willing
to
defer
to
your
good
*NL*
sense
.
What
will
be
--
will
be
.
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
grudge
my
*NL*
native
country
any
portion
of
the
wealth
that
may
be
accumulated
by
our
*NL*
descendants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
nodding
towards
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``
and
I
drink
*NL*
my
love
to
you
all
,
and
every
blessing
and
success
attend
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
put
down
the
two
children
he
had
been
nursing
,
one
on
each
*NL*
knee
,
to
join
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Micawber
in
drinking
to
all
of
us
in
return
;
*NL*
and
when
he
and
the
Micawbers
cordially
shook
hands
as
comrades
,
and
his
*NL*
brown
face
brightened
with
a
smile
,
I
felt
that
he
would
make
his
way
,
*NL*
establish
a
good
name
,
and
be
beloved
,
go
where
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
children
were
instructed
,
each
to
dip
a
wooden
spoon
into
Mr.
*NL*
Micawber
's
pot
,
and
pledge
us
in
its
contents
.
When
this
was
done
,
my
*NL*
aunt
and
Agnes
rose
,
and
parted
from
the
emigrants
.
It
was
a
sorrowful
*NL*
farewell
.
They
were
all
crying
;
the
children
hung
about
Agnes
to
the
*NL*
last
;
and
we
left
poor
Mrs.
Micawber
in
a
very
distressed
condition
,
*NL*
sobbing
and
weeping
by
a
dim
candle
,
that
must
have
made
the
room
look
,
*NL*
from
the
river
,
like
a
miserable
light-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
down
again
next
morning
to
see
that
they
were
away
.
They
had
*NL*
departed
,
in
a
boat
,
as
early
as
five
o'clock
.
It
was
a
wonderful
*NL*
instance
to
me
of
the
gap
such
partings
make
,
that
although
my
*NL*
association
of
them
with
the
tumble-down
public-house
and
the
wooden
*NL*
stairs
dated
only
from
last
night
,
both
seemed
dreary
and
deserted
,
now
*NL*
that
they
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
,
my
old
nurse
and
I
went
down
to
*NL*
Gravesend
.
We
found
the
ship
in
the
river
,
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
*NL*
boats
;
a
favourable
wind
blowing
;
the
signal
for
sailing
at
her
mast
*NL*
head
.
I
hired
a
boat
directly
,
and
we
put
off
to
her
;
and
getting
*NL*
through
the
little
vortex
of
confusion
of
which
she
was
the
centre
,
went
*NL*
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
was
waiting
for
us
on
deck
.
He
told
me
that
Mr.
Micawber
*NL*
had
just
now
been
arrested
again
-LRB-
and
for
the
last
time
-RRB-
at
the
suit
of
*NL*
Heep
,
and
that
,
in
compliance
with
a
request
I
had
made
to
him
,
he
had
*NL*
paid
the
money
:
which
I
repaid
him
.
He
then
took
us
down
between
decks
;
*NL*
and
there
,
any
lingering
fears
I
had
of
his
having
heard
any
rumours
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
,
were
dispelled
by
Mr.
Micawber
's
coming
out
of
the
*NL*
gloom
,
taking
his
arm
with
an
air
of
friendship
and
protection
,
and
*NL*
telling
me
that
they
had
scarcely
been
asunder
for
a
moment
,
since
the
*NL*
night
before
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
such
a
strange
scene
to
me
,
and
so
confined
and
dark
,
that
,
at
*NL*
first
,
I
could
make
out
hardly
anything
;
but
,
by
degrees
,
it
cleared
,
as
*NL*
my
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom
,
and
I
seemed
to
stand
in
a
*NL*
picture
by
OSTADE
.
Among
the
great
beams
,
bulks
,
and
ringbolts
of
the
*NL*
ship
,
and
the
emigrant-berths
,
and
chests
,
and
bundles
,
and
barrels
,
and
*NL*
heaps
of
miscellaneous
baggage
--
lighted
up
,
here
and
there
,
by
dangling
*NL*
lanterns
;
and
elsewhere
by
the
yellow
day-light
straying
down
a
windsail
*NL*
or
a
hatchway
--
were
crowded
groups
of
people
,
making
new
friendships
,
*NL*
taking
leave
of
one
another
,
talking
,
laughing
,
crying
,
eating
and
*NL*
drinking
;
some
,
already
settled
down
into
the
possession
of
their
few
*NL*
feet
of
space
,
with
their
little
households
arranged
,
and
tiny
children
*NL*
established
on
stools
,
or
in
dwarf
elbow-chairs
;
others
,
despairing
of
a
*NL*
resting-place
,
and
wandering
disconsolately
.
From
babies
who
had
but
a
*NL*
week
or
two
of
life
behind
them
,
to
crooked
old
men
and
women
who
seemed
*NL*
to
have
but
a
week
or
two
of
life
before
them
;
and
from
ploughmen
bodily
*NL*
carrying
out
soil
of
England
on
their
boots
,
to
smiths
taking
away
*NL*
samples
of
its
soot
and
smoke
upon
their
skins
;
every
age
and
occupation
*NL*
appeared
to
be
crammed
into
the
narrow
compass
of
the
`
tween
decks
.

*NL*
As
my
eye
glanced
round
this
place
,
I
thought
I
saw
sitting
,
by
an
open
*NL*
port
,
with
one
of
the
Micawber
children
near
her
,
a
figure
like
Emily
's
;
*NL*
it
first
attracted
my
attention
,
by
another
figure
parting
from
it
with
*NL*
a
kiss
;
and
as
it
glided
calmly
away
through
the
disorder
,
reminding
me
*NL*
of
--
Agnes
!
But
in
the
rapid
motion
and
confusion
,
and
in
the
*NL*
unsettlement
of
my
own
thoughts
,
I
lost
it
again
;
and
only
knew
that
the
*NL*
time
was
come
when
all
visitors
were
being
warned
to
leave
the
ship
;
*NL*
that
my
nurse
was
crying
on
a
chest
beside
me
;
and
that
Mrs.
Gummidge
,
*NL*
assisted
by
some
younger
stooping
woman
in
black
,
was
busily
arranging
*NL*
Mr.
Peggotty
's
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
last
wured
,
Mas
'
r
Davy
?
''
said
he
.
``
Is
there
any
one
*NL*
forgotten
thing
afore
we
parts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
!
''
said
I.
``
Martha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
the
younger
woman
I
have
mentioned
on
the
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
Martha
stood
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
bless
you
,
you
good
man
!
''
cried
I.
``
You
take
her
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
for
him
,
with
a
burst
of
tears
.
I
could
speak
no
more
,
at
*NL*
that
time
,
but
I
wrung
his
hand
;
and
if
ever
I
have
loved
and
honored
*NL*
any
man
,
I
loved
and
honored
that
man
in
my
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ship
was
clearing
fast
of
strangers
.
The
greatest
trial
that
I
had
,
*NL*
remained
.
I
told
him
what
the
noble
spirit
that
was
gone
,
had
given
me
*NL*
in
charge
to
say
at
parting
.
It
moved
him
deeply
.
But
when
he
charged
*NL*
me
,
in
return
,
with
many
messages
of
affection
and
regret
for
those
deaf
*NL*
ears
,
he
moved
me
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
was
come
.
I
embraced
him
,
took
my
weeping
nurse
upon
my
arm
,
*NL*
and
hurried
away
.
On
deck
,
I
took
leave
of
poor
Mrs.
Micawber
.
She
was
*NL*
looking
distractedly
about
for
her
family
,
even
then
;
and
her
last
words
*NL*
to
me
were
,
that
she
never
would
desert
Mr.
Micawber
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
over
the
side
into
our
boat
,
and
lay
at
a
little
distance
to
see
*NL*
the
ship
wafted
on
her
course
.
It
was
then
calm
,
radiant
sunset
.
She
lay
*NL*
between
us
,
and
the
red
light
;
and
every
taper
line
and
spar
was
visible
*NL*
against
the
glow
.
A
sight
at
once
so
beautiful
,
so
mournful
,
and
so
*NL*
hopeful
,
as
the
glorious
ship
,
lying
,
still
,
on
the
flushed
water
,
with
*NL*
all
the
life
on
board
her
crowded
at
the
bulwarks
,
and
there
clustering
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
bare-headed
and
silent
,
I
never
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silent
,
only
for
a
moment
.
As
the
sails
rose
to
the
wind
,
and
the
ship
*NL*
began
to
move
,
there
broke
from
all
the
boats
three
resounding
cheers
,
*NL*
which
those
on
board
took
up
,
and
echoed
back
,
and
which
were
echoed
and
*NL*
re-echoed
.
My
heart
burst
out
when
I
heard
the
sound
,
and
beheld
the
*NL*
waving
of
the
hats
and
handkerchiefs
--
and
then
I
saw
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
I
saw
her
,
at
her
uncle
's
side
,
and
trembling
on
his
shoulder
.
He
*NL*
pointed
to
us
with
an
eager
hand
;
and
she
saw
us
,
and
waved
her
last
*NL*
good-bye
to
me
.
Aye
,
Emily
,
beautiful
and
drooping
,
cling
to
him
with
*NL*
the
utmost
trust
of
thy
bruised
heart
;
for
he
has
clung
to
thee
,
with
*NL*
all
the
might
of
his
great
love
!
*NL*
*NL*
Surrounded
by
the
rosy
light
,
and
standing
high
upon
the
deck
,
apart
*NL*
together
,
she
clinging
to
him
,
and
he
holding
her
,
they
solemnly
passed
*NL*
away
.
The
night
had
fallen
on
the
Kentish
hills
when
we
were
rowed
*NL*
ashore
--
and
fallen
darkly
upon
me
.

CHAPTER
LVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
ABSENCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
and
gloomy
night
that
gathered
on
me
,
haunted
by
the
*NL*
ghosts
of
many
hopes
,
of
many
dear
remembrances
,
many
errors
,
many
*NL*
unavailing
sorrows
and
regrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
away
from
England
;
not
knowing
,
even
then
,
how
great
the
shock
*NL*
was
,
that
I
had
to
bear
.
I
left
all
who
were
dear
to
me
,
and
went
away
;
*NL*
and
believed
that
I
had
borne
it
,
and
it
was
past
.
As
a
man
upon
a
field
*NL*
of
battle
will
receive
a
mortal
hurt
,
and
scarcely
know
that
he
is
*NL*
struck
,
so
I
,
when
I
was
left
alone
with
my
undisciplined
heart
,
had
no
*NL*
conception
of
the
wound
with
which
it
had
to
strive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knowledge
came
upon
me
,
not
quickly
,
but
little
by
little
,
and
*NL*
grain
by
grain
.
The
desolate
feeling
with
which
I
went
abroad
,
deepened
*NL*
and
widened
hourly
.
At
first
it
was
a
heavy
sense
of
loss
and
sorrow
,
*NL*
wherein
I
could
distinguish
little
else
.
By
imperceptible
degrees
,
*NL*
it
became
a
hopeless
consciousness
of
all
that
I
had
lost
--
love
,
*NL*
friendship
,
interest
;
of
all
that
had
been
shattered
--
my
first
trust
,
*NL*
my
first
affection
,
the
whole
airy
castle
of
my
life
;
of
all
that
*NL*
remained
--
a
ruined
blank
and
waste
,
lying
wide
around
me
,
unbroken
,
to
*NL*
the
dark
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
my
grief
were
selfish
,
I
did
not
know
it
to
be
so
.
I
mourned
for
my
*NL*
child-wife
,
taken
from
her
blooming
world
,
so
young
.
I
mourned
for
him
*NL*
who
might
have
won
the
love
and
admiration
of
thousands
,
as
he
had
won
*NL*
mine
long
ago
.
I
mourned
for
the
broken
heart
that
had
found
rest
in
the
*NL*
stormy
sea
;
and
for
the
wandering
remnants
of
the
simple
home
,
where
I
*NL*
had
heard
the
night-wind
blowing
,
when
I
was
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
accumulated
sadness
into
which
I
fell
,
I
had
at
length
no
hope
*NL*
of
ever
issuing
again
.
I
roamed
from
place
to
place
,
carrying
my
burden
*NL*
with
me
everywhere
.
I
felt
its
whole
weight
now
;
and
I
drooped
beneath
*NL*
it
,
and
I
said
in
my
heart
that
it
could
never
be
lightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
despondency
was
at
its
worst
,
I
believed
that
I
should
die
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
I
thought
that
I
would
like
to
die
at
home
;
and
actually
*NL*
turned
back
on
my
road
,
that
I
might
get
there
soon
.
At
other
times
,
I
*NL*
passed
on
farther
away
,
from
city
to
city
,
seeking
I
know
not
what
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
leave
I
know
not
what
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
in
my
power
to
retrace
,
one
by
one
,
all
the
weary
phases
of
*NL*
distress
of
mind
through
which
I
passed
.
There
are
some
dreams
that
can
*NL*
only
be
imperfectly
and
vaguely
described
;
and
when
I
oblige
myself
to
*NL*
look
back
on
this
time
of
my
life
,
I
seem
to
be
recalling
such
a
dream
.
*NL*
I
see
myself
passing
on
among
the
novelties
of
foreign
towns
,
palaces
,
*NL*
cathedrals
,
temples
,
pictures
,
castles
,
tombs
,
fantastic
streets
--
the
*NL*
old
abiding
places
of
History
and
Fancy
--
as
a
dreamer
might
;
bearing
my
*NL*
painful
load
through
all
,
and
hardly
conscious
of
the
objects
as
they
*NL*
fade
before
me
.
Listlessness
to
everything
,
but
brooding
sorrow
,
was
the
*NL*
night
that
fell
on
my
undisciplined
heart
.
Let
me
look
up
from
it
--
as
at
*NL*
last
I
did
,
thank
Heaven
!
--
and
from
its
long
,
sad
,
wretched
dream
,
to
*NL*
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
months
I
travelled
with
this
ever-darkening
cloud
upon
my
mind
.
*NL*
Some
blind
reasons
that
I
had
for
not
returning
home
--
reasons
then
*NL*
struggling
within
me
,
vainly
,
for
more
distinct
expression
--
kept
me
on
*NL*
my
pilgrimage
.
Sometimes
,
I
had
proceeded
restlessly
from
place
to
*NL*
place
,
stopping
nowhere
;
sometimes
,
I
had
lingered
long
in
one
spot
.
I
*NL*
had
had
no
purpose
,
no
sustaining
soul
within
me
,
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
Switzerland
.
I
had
come
out
of
Italy
,
over
one
of
the
great
*NL*
passes
of
the
Alps
,
and
had
since
wandered
with
a
guide
among
the
*NL*
bye-ways
of
the
mountains
.
If
those
awful
solitudes
had
spoken
to
my
*NL*
heart
,
I
did
not
know
it
.
I
had
found
sublimity
and
wonder
in
the
dread
*NL*
heights
and
precipices
,
in
the
roaring
torrents
,
and
the
wastes
of
ice
*NL*
and
snow
;
but
as
yet
,
they
had
taught
me
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
,
one
evening
before
sunset
,
down
into
a
valley
,
where
I
was
to
*NL*
rest
.
In
the
course
of
my
descent
to
it
,
by
the
winding
track
along
*NL*
the
mountain-side
,
from
which
I
saw
it
shining
far
below
,
I
think
*NL*
some
long-unwonted
sense
of
beauty
and
tranquillity
,
some
softening
*NL*
influence
awakened
by
its
peace
,
moved
faintly
in
my
breast
.
I
remember
*NL*
pausing
once
,
with
a
kind
of
sorrow
that
was
not
all
oppressive
,
not
*NL*
quite
despairing
.
I
remember
almost
hoping
that
some
better
change
was
*NL*
possible
within
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
into
the
valley
,
as
the
evening
sun
was
shining
on
the
remote
*NL*
heights
of
snow
,
that
closed
it
in
,
like
eternal
clouds
.
The
bases
of
*NL*
the
mountains
forming
the
gorge
in
which
the
little
village
lay
,
were
*NL*
richly
green
;
and
high
above
this
gentler
vegetation
,
grew
forests
of
*NL*
dark
fir
,
cleaving
the
wintry
snow-drift
,
wedge-like
,
and
stemming
the
*NL*
avalanche
.
Above
these
,
were
range
upon
range
of
craggy
steeps
,
grey
*NL*
rock
,
bright
ice
,
and
smooth
verdure-specks
of
pasture
,
all
gradually
*NL*
blending
with
the
crowning
snow
.
Dotted
here
and
there
on
the
*NL*
mountain
's
-
side
,
each
tiny
dot
a
home
,
were
lonely
wooden
cottages
,
so
*NL*
dwarfed
by
the
towering
heights
that
they
appeared
too
small
for
toys
.
*NL*
So
did
even
the
clustered
village
in
the
valley
,
with
its
wooden
bridge
*NL*
across
the
stream
,
where
the
stream
tumbled
over
broken
rocks
,
and
*NL*
roared
away
among
the
trees
.
In
the
quiet
air
,
there
was
a
sound
of
*NL*
distant
singing
--
shepherd
voices
;
but
,
as
one
bright
evening
cloud
*NL*
floated
midway
along
the
mountain
's
-
side
,
I
could
almost
have
believed
*NL*
it
came
from
there
,
and
was
not
earthly
music
.
All
at
once
,
in
this
*NL*
serenity
,
great
Nature
spoke
to
me
;
and
soothed
me
to
lay
down
my
weary
*NL*
head
upon
the
grass
,
and
weep
as
I
had
not
wept
yet
,
since
Dora
died
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
found
a
packet
of
letters
awaiting
me
but
a
few
minutes
before
,
*NL*
and
had
strolled
out
of
the
village
to
read
them
while
my
supper
was
*NL*
making
ready
.
Other
packets
had
missed
me
,
and
I
had
received
none
for
a
*NL*
long
time
.
Beyond
a
line
or
two
,
to
say
that
I
was
well
,
and
had
arrived
*NL*
at
such
a
place
,
I
had
not
had
fortitude
or
constancy
to
write
a
letter
*NL*
since
I
left
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
packet
was
in
my
hand
.
I
opened
it
,
and
read
the
writing
of
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
happy
and
useful
,
was
prospering
as
she
had
hoped
.
That
was
all
*NL*
she
told
me
of
herself
.
The
rest
referred
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
me
no
advice
;
she
urged
no
duty
on
me
;
she
only
told
me
,
in
her
*NL*
own
fervent
manner
,
what
her
trust
in
me
was
.
She
knew
-LRB-
she
said
-RRB-
how
*NL*
such
a
nature
as
mine
would
turn
affliction
to
good
.
She
knew
how
trial
*NL*
and
emotion
would
exalt
and
strengthen
it
.
She
was
sure
that
in
my
every
*NL*
purpose
I
should
gain
a
firmer
and
a
higher
tendency
,
through
the
grief
*NL*
I
had
undergone
.
She
,
who
so
gloried
in
my
fame
,
and
so
looked
forward
*NL*
to
its
augmentation
,
well
knew
that
I
would
labor
on
.
She
knew
that
in
*NL*
me
,
sorrow
could
not
be
weakness
,
but
must
be
strength
.
As
the
endurance
*NL*
of
my
childish
days
had
done
its
part
to
make
me
what
I
was
,
so
greater
*NL*
calamities
would
nerve
me
on
,
to
be
yet
better
than
I
was
;
and
so
,
as
*NL*
they
had
taught
me
,
would
I
teach
others
.
She
commended
me
to
God
,
who
*NL*
had
taken
my
innocent
darling
to
His
rest
;
and
in
her
sisterly
affection
*NL*
cherished
me
always
,
and
was
always
at
my
side
go
where
I
would
;
proud
*NL*
of
what
I
had
done
,
but
infinitely
prouder
yet
of
what
I
was
reserved
to
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
the
letter
in
my
breast
,
and
thought
what
had
I
been
an
hour
ago
!
*NL*
When
I
heard
the
voices
die
away
,
and
saw
the
quiet
evening
cloud
grow
*NL*
dim
,
and
all
the
colors
in
the
valley
fade
,
and
the
golden
snow
upon
the
*NL*
mountain
tops
become
a
remote
part
of
the
pale
night
sky
,
yet
felt
that
*NL*
the
night
was
passing
from
my
mind
,
and
all
its
shadows
clearing
,
there
*NL*
was
no
name
for
the
love
I
bore
her
,
dearer
to
me
,
henceforward
,
than
*NL*
ever
until
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
her
letter
,
many
times
.
I
wrote
to
her
before
I
slept
.
I
told
her
*NL*
that
I
had
been
in
sore
need
of
her
help
;
that
without
her
I
was
not
,
*NL*
and
I
never
had
been
,
what
she
thought
me
;
but
,
that
she
inspired
me
to
*NL*
be
that
,
and
I
would
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
try
.
In
three
months
more
,
a
year
would
have
passed
since
the
*NL*
beginning
of
my
sorrow
.
I
determined
to
make
no
resolutions
until
the
*NL*
expiration
of
those
three
months
,
but
to
try
.
I
lived
in
that
valley
,
*NL*
and
its
neighbourhood
,
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
months
gone
,
I
resolved
to
remain
away
from
home
for
some
time
*NL*
longer
;
to
settle
myself
for
the
present
in
Switzerland
,
which
was
*NL*
growing
dear
to
me
in
the
remembrance
of
that
evening
;
to
resume
my
pen
;
*NL*
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
resorted
humbly
whither
Agnes
had
commended
me
;
I
sought
out
Nature
,
*NL*
never
sought
in
vain
;
and
I
admitted
to
my
breast
the
human
interest
I
*NL*
had
lately
shrunk
from
.
It
was
not
long
,
before
I
had
almost
as
many
*NL*
friends
in
the
valley
as
in
Yarmouth
;
and
when
I
left
it
,
before
the
*NL*
winter
set
in
,
for
Geneva
,
and
came
back
in
the
spring
,
their
cordial
*NL*
greetings
had
a
homely
sound
to
me
,
although
they
were
not
conveyed
in
*NL*
English
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
worked
early
and
late
,
patiently
and
hard
.
I
wrote
a
Story
,
with
a
*NL*
purpose
growing
,
not
remotely
,
out
of
my
experience
,
and
sent
it
to
*NL*
Traddles
,
and
he
arranged
for
its
publication
very
advantageously
for
*NL*
me
;
and
the
tidings
of
my
growing
reputation
began
to
reach
me
from
*NL*
travellers
whom
I
encountered
by
chance
.
After
some
rest
and
change
,
I
*NL*
fell
to
work
,
in
my
old
ardent
way
,
on
a
new
fancy
,
which
took
strong
*NL*
possession
of
me
.
As
I
advanced
in
the
execution
of
this
task
,
I
felt
it
*NL*
more
and
more
,
and
roused
my
utmost
energies
to
do
it
well
.
This
was
my
*NL*
third
work
of
fiction
.
It
was
not
half
written
,
when
,
in
an
interval
of
*NL*
rest
,
I
thought
of
returning
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
,
though
studying
and
working
patiently
,
I
had
accustomed
*NL*
myself
to
robust
exercise
.
My
health
,
severely
impaired
when
I
left
*NL*
England
,
was
quite
restored
.
I
had
seen
much
.
I
had
been
in
many
*NL*
countries
,
and
I
hope
I
had
improved
my
store
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
now
recalled
all
that
I
think
it
needful
to
recal
here
,
of
this
*NL*
term
of
absence
--
with
one
reservation
.
I
have
made
it
,
thus
far
,
with
no
*NL*
purpose
of
suppressing
any
of
my
thoughts
;
for
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
*NL*
said
,
this
narrative
is
my
written
memory
.
I
have
desired
to
keep
the
*NL*
most
secret
current
of
my
mind
apart
,
and
to
the
last
.
I
enter
on
it
*NL*
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
so
completely
penetrate
the
mystery
of
my
own
heart
,
as
to
know
*NL*
when
I
began
to
think
that
I
might
have
set
its
earliest
and
brightest
*NL*
hopes
on
Agnes
.
I
can
not
say
at
what
stage
of
my
grief
it
first
became
*NL*
associated
with
the
reflection
,
that
,
in
my
wayward
boyhood
,
I
had
*NL*
thrown
away
the
treasure
of
her
love
.
I
believe
I
may
have
heard
some
*NL*
whisper
of
that
distant
thought
,
in
the
old
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
*NL*
something
never
to
be
realised
,
of
which
I
had
been
sensible
.
But
the
*NL*
thought
came
into
my
mind
as
a
new
reproach
and
new
regret
,
when
I
was
*NL*
left
so
sad
and
lonely
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
at
that
time
,
I
had
been
much
with
her
,
I
should
,
in
the
weakness
of
*NL*
my
desolation
,
have
betrayed
this
.
It
was
what
I
remotely
dreaded
when
I
*NL*
was
first
impelled
to
stay
away
from
England
.
I
could
not
have
borne
to
*NL*
lose
the
smallest
portion
of
her
sisterly
affection
;
yet
,
in
that
*NL*
betrayal
,
I
should
have
set
a
constraint
between
us
hitherto
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
forget
that
the
feeling
with
which
she
now
regarded
me
had
*NL*
grown
up
in
my
own
free
choice
and
course
.
That
if
she
had
ever
loved
me
*NL*
with
another
love
--
and
I
sometimes
thought
the
time
was
when
she
might
*NL*
have
done
so
--
I
had
cast
it
away
.
It
was
nothing
,
now
,
that
I
had
*NL*
accustomed
myself
to
think
of
her
,
when
we
were
both
mere
children
,
as
*NL*
one
who
was
far
removed
from
my
wild
fancies
.
I
had
bestowed
my
*NL*
passionate
tenderness
upon
another
object
;
and
what
I
might
have
done
,
I
*NL*
had
not
done
;
and
what
Agnes
was
to
me
,
I
and
her
own
noble
heart
had
*NL*
made
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
beginning
of
the
change
that
gradually
worked
in
me
,
when
I
tried
*NL*
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
myself
and
be
a
better
man
,
I
did
*NL*
glance
,
through
some
indefinite
probation
,
to
a
period
when
I
might
*NL*
possibly
hope
to
cancel
the
mistaken
past
,
and
to
be
so
blessed
as
to
*NL*
marry
her
.
But
,
as
time
wore
on
,
this
shadowy
prospect
faded
,
and
*NL*
departed
from
me
.
If
she
had
ever
loved
me
,
then
,
I
should
hold
her
the
*NL*
more
sacred
;
remembering
the
confidences
I
had
reposed
in
her
,
her
*NL*
knowledge
of
my
errant
heart
,
the
sacrifice
she
must
have
made
to
be
my
*NL*
friend
and
sister
,
and
the
victory
she
had
won
.
If
she
had
never
loved
*NL*
me
,
could
I
believe
that
she
would
love
me
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
always
felt
my
weakness
,
in
comparison
with
her
constancy
and
*NL*
fortitude
;
and
now
I
felt
it
more
and
more
.
Whatever
I
might
have
been
*NL*
to
her
,
or
she
to
me
,
if
I
had
been
more
worthy
of
her
long
ago
,
I
was
*NL*
not
now
,
and
she
was
not
.
The
time
was
past
.
I
had
let
it
go
by
,
and
had
*NL*
deservedly
lost
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
I
suffered
much
in
these
contentions
,
that
they
filled
me
with
*NL*
unhappiness
and
remorse
,
and
yet
that
I
had
a
sustaining
sense
that
it
*NL*
was
required
of
me
,
in
right
and
honor
,
to
keep
away
from
myself
,
with
*NL*
shame
,
the
thought
of
turning
to
the
dear
girl
in
the
withering
of
my
*NL*
hopes
,
from
whom
I
had
frivolously
turned
when
they
were
bright
and
*NL*
fresh
--
which
consideration
was
at
the
root
of
every
thought
I
had
*NL*
concerning
her
--
is
all
equally
true
.
I
made
no
effort
to
conceal
from
*NL*
myself
,
now
,
that
I
loved
her
,
that
I
was
devoted
to
her
;
but
I
brought
*NL*
the
assurance
home
to
myself
,
that
it
was
now
too
late
,
and
that
our
*NL*
long-subsisting
relation
must
be
undisturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
thought
,
much
and
often
,
of
my
Dora
's
shadowing
out
to
me
what
*NL*
might
have
happened
,
in
those
years
that
were
destined
not
to
try
us
;
I
*NL*
had
considered
how
the
things
that
never
happen
,
are
often
as
much
*NL*
realities
to
us
,
in
their
effects
,
as
those
that
are
accomplished
.
The
*NL*
very
years
she
spoke
of
,
were
realities
now
,
for
my
correction
;
and
*NL*
would
have
been
,
one
day
,
a
little
later
perhaps
,
though
we
had
parted
*NL*
in
our
earliest
folly
.
I
endeavoured
to
convert
what
might
have
been
*NL*
between
myself
and
Agnes
,
into
a
means
of
making
me
more
self-denying
,
*NL*
more
resolved
,
more
conscious
of
myself
,
and
my
defects
and
errors
.
*NL*
Thus
,
through
the
reflection
that
it
might
have
been
,
I
arrived
at
the
*NL*
conviction
that
it
could
never
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
with
their
perplexities
and
inconsistencies
,
were
the
shifting
*NL*
quicksands
of
my
mind
,
from
the
time
of
my
departure
to
the
time
of
my
*NL*
return
home
,
three
years
afterwards
.
Three
years
had
elapsed
since
the
*NL*
sailing
of
the
emigrant
ship
;
when
,
at
that
same
hour
of
sunset
,
and
in
*NL*
the
same
place
,
I
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
packet
vessel
that
brought
me
*NL*
home
,
looking
on
the
rosy
water
where
I
had
seen
the
image
of
that
ship
*NL*
reflected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
years
.
Long
in
the
aggregate
,
though
short
as
they
went
by
.
And
*NL*
home
was
very
dear
to
me
,
and
Agnes
too
--
but
she
was
not
mine
--
she
was
*NL*
never
to
be
mine
.
She
might
have
been
,
but
that
was
past
!

CHAPTER
LIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
RETURN
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
landed
in
London
on
a
wintry
autumn
evening
.
It
was
dark
and
raining
,
*NL*
and
I
saw
more
fog
and
mud
in
a
minute
than
I
had
seen
in
a
year
.
I
*NL*
walked
from
the
Custom
House
to
the
Monument
before
I
found
a
coach
;
and
*NL*
although
the
very
house-fronts
,
looking
on
the
swollen
gutters
,
were
*NL*
like
old
friends
to
me
,
I
could
not
but
admit
that
they
were
very
dingy
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
remarked
--
I
suppose
everybody
has
--
that
one
's
going
away
*NL*
from
a
familiar
place
,
would
seem
to
be
the
signal
for
change
in
it
.
As
*NL*
I
looked
out
of
the
coach-window
,
and
observed
that
an
old
house
on
*NL*
Fish-street
Hill
,
which
had
stood
untouched
by
painter
,
carpenter
,
or
*NL*
bricklayer
,
for
a
century
,
had
been
pulled
down
in
my
absence
;
and
that
*NL*
a
neighbouring
street
,
of
time-honored
insalubrity
and
inconvenience
,
*NL*
was
being
drained
and
widened
;
I
half
expected
to
find
St.
Paul
's
*NL*
Cathedral
looking
older
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
changes
in
the
fortunes
of
my
friends
,
I
was
prepared
.
My
aunt
*NL*
had
long
been
re-established
at
Dover
,
and
Traddles
had
begun
to
get
*NL*
into
some
little
practice
at
the
Bar
,
in
the
very
first
term
after
my
*NL*
departure
.
He
had
chambers
in
Gray
's
Inn
,
now
;
and
had
told
me
,
in
his
*NL*
last
letters
,
that
he
was
not
without
hopes
of
being
soon
united
to
the
*NL*
dearest
girl
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
expected
me
home
before
Christmas
;
but
had
no
idea
of
my
returning
*NL*
so
soon
.
I
had
purposely
misled
them
,
that
I
might
have
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
taking
them
by
surprise
.
And
yet
,
I
was
perverse
enough
to
feel
a
chill
*NL*
and
disappointment
in
receiving
no
welcome
,
and
rattling
,
alone
and
*NL*
silent
,
through
the
misty
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
well-known
shops
,
however
,
with
their
cheerful
lights
,
did
something
*NL*
for
me
;
and
when
I
alighted
at
the
door
of
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee-house
,
*NL*
I
had
recovered
my
spirits
.
It
recalled
,
at
first
,
that
so-different
*NL*
time
when
I
had
put
up
at
the
Golden
Cross
,
and
reminded
me
of
the
*NL*
changes
that
had
come
to
pass
since
then
;
but
that
was
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
Mr.
Traddles
lives
in
the
Inn
?
''
I
asked
the
waiter
,
*NL*
as
I
warmed
myself
by
the
coffee-room
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holborn
Court
,
sir
.
Number
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Traddles
has
a
rising
reputation
among
the
lawyers
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
waiter
,
``
probably
he
has
,
sir
;
but
I
am
not
*NL*
aware
of
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
waiter
,
who
was
middle-aged
and
spare
,
looked
for
help
to
a
waiter
*NL*
of
more
authority
--
a
stout
,
potential
old
man
,
with
a
double-chin
,
in
*NL*
black
breeches
and
stockings
,
who
came
out
of
a
place
like
a
*NL*
churchwarden
's
pew
,
at
the
end
of
the
coffee-room
,
where
he
kept
company
*NL*
with
a
cash-box
,
a
Directory
,
a
Law-list
,
and
other
books
and
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Traddles
,
''
said
the
spare
waiter
.
``
Number
two
in
the
Court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
potential
waiter
waved
him
away
,
and
turned
,
gravely
,
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
inquiring
,
''
said
I
,
``
whether
Mr.
Traddles
at
number
two
in
the
*NL*
Court
,
has
not
a
rising
reputation
among
the
lawyers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
heard
his
name
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
in
a
rich
husky
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
quite
apologetic
for
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
young
man
,
sure
?
''
said
the
portentous
waiter
,
fixing
his
eyes
*NL*
severely
on
me
.
``
How
long
has
he
been
in
the
Inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
above
three
years
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
,
who
I
supposed
had
lived
in
his
churchwarden
's
pew
for
forty
*NL*
years
,
could
not
pursue
such
an
insignificant
subject
.
He
asked
me
what
*NL*
I
would
have
for
dinner
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
I
was
in
England
again
,
and
really
was
quite
cast
down
on
*NL*
Traddles
's
account
.
There
seemed
to
be
no
hope
for
him
.
I
meekly
ordered
*NL*
a
bit
of
fish
and
a
steak
,
and
stood
before
the
fire
musing
on
his
*NL*
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
followed
the
chief
waiter
with
my
eyes
,
I
could
not
help
thinking
*NL*
that
the
garden
in
which
he
had
gradually
blown
to
be
the
flower
he
*NL*
was
,
was
an
arduous
place
to
rise
in
.
It
had
such
a
prescriptive
,
*NL*
stiff-necked
,
long-established
,
solemn
,
elderly
air
.
I
glanced
about
*NL*
the
room
,
which
had
had
its
sanded
floor
sanded
,
no
doubt
,
in
exactly
*NL*
the
same
manner
when
the
chief
waiter
was
a
boy
--
if
he
ever
was
a
*NL*
boy
,
which
appeared
improbable
;
and
at
the
shining
tables
,
where
*NL*
I
saw
myself
reflected
,
in
unruffled
depths
of
old
mahogany
;
and
*NL*
at
the
lamps
,
without
a
flaw
in
their
trimming
or
cleaning
;
and
at
*NL*
the
comfortable
green
curtains
,
with
their
pure
brass
rods
,
snugly
*NL*
enclosing
the
boxes
;
and
at
the
two
large
coal
fires
,
brightly
burning
;
*NL*
and
at
the
rows
of
decanters
,
burly
as
if
with
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
pipes
of
expensive
old
port
wine
below
;
and
both
England
,
and
the
law
,
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
be
taken
by
storm
.
I
went
*NL*
up
to
my
bed-room
to
change
my
wet
clothes
;
and
the
vast
extent
of
that
*NL*
old
wainscotted
apartment
-LRB-
which
was
over
the
archway
leading
to
the
*NL*
Inn
,
I
remember
-RRB-
,
and
the
sedate
immensity
of
the
four-post
bedstead
,
*NL*
and
the
indomitable
gravity
of
the
chests
of
drawers
,
all
seemed
to
*NL*
unite
in
sternly
frowning
on
the
fortunes
of
Traddles
,
or
on
any
such
*NL*
daring
youth
.
I
came
down
again
to
my
dinner
;
and
even
the
slow
comfort
*NL*
of
the
meal
,
and
the
orderly
silence
of
the
place
--
which
was
bare
of
*NL*
guests
,
the
Long
Vacation
not
yet
being
over
--
were
eloquent
on
the
*NL*
audacity
of
Traddles
,
and
his
small
hopes
of
a
livelihood
for
twenty
*NL*
years
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
seen
nothing
like
this
since
I
went
away
,
and
it
quite
dashed
my
*NL*
hopes
for
my
friend
.
The
chief
waiter
had
had
enough
of
me
.
He
came
near
*NL*
me
no
more
;
but
devoted
himself
to
an
old
gentleman
in
long
gaiters
,
to
*NL*
meet
whom
a
pint
of
special
port
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
cellar
of
its
*NL*
own
accord
,
for
he
gave
no
order
.
The
second
waiter
informed
me
,
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
that
this
old
gentleman
was
a
retired
conveyancer
living
in
the
*NL*
Square
,
and
worth
a
mint
of
money
,
which
it
was
expected
he
would
leave
*NL*
to
his
laundress
's
daughter
;
likewise
that
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
a
*NL*
service
of
plate
in
a
bureau
,
all
tarnished
with
lying
by
,
though
more
*NL*
than
one
spoon
and
a
fork
had
never
yet
been
beheld
in
his
chambers
by
*NL*
mortal
vision
.
By
this
time
,
I
quite
gave
Traddles
up
for
lost
;
and
*NL*
settled
in
my
own
mind
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
very
anxious
to
see
the
dear
old
fellow
,
nevertheless
,
I
*NL*
despatched
my
dinner
;
in
a
manner
not
at
all
calculated
to
raise
me
in
*NL*
the
opinion
of
the
chief
waiter
,
and
hurried
out
by
the
back
way
.
Number
*NL*
two
in
the
Court
was
soon
reached
;
and
an
inscription
on
the
door-post
*NL*
informing
me
that
Mr.
Traddles
occupied
a
set
of
chambers
on
the
top
*NL*
story
,
I
ascended
the
staircase
.
A
crazy
old
staircase
I
found
it
to
be
,
*NL*
feebly
lighted
on
each
landing
by
a
club-headed
little
oil
wick
,
dying
*NL*
away
in
a
little
dungeon
of
dirty
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
my
stumbling
up
stairs
,
I
fancied
I
heard
a
pleasant
*NL*
sound
of
laughter
;
and
not
the
laughter
of
an
attorney
or
barrister
,
or
*NL*
attorney
's
clerk
or
barrister
's
clerk
,
but
of
two
or
three
merry
girls
.
*NL*
Happening
,
however
,
as
I
stopped
to
listen
,
to
put
my
foot
in
a
hole
*NL*
where
the
Honorable
Society
of
Gray
's
Inn
had
left
a
plank
deficient
,
I
*NL*
fell
down
with
some
noise
,
and
when
I
recovered
my
footing
all
was
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Groping
my
way
more
carefully
,
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
my
heart
*NL*
beat
high
when
I
found
the
outer
door
,
which
had
MR.
TRADDLES
painted
on
*NL*
it
,
open
.
I
knocked
.
A
considerable
scuffling
within
ensued
,
but
nothing
*NL*
else
.
I
therefore
knocked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
sharp-looking
lad
,
half-footboy
and
half-clerk
,
who
was
very
*NL*
much
out
of
breath
,
but
who
looked
at
me
as
if
he
defied
me
to
prove
it
*NL*
legally
,
presented
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Traddles
within
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
but
he
's
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
survey
of
me
,
the
sharp-looking
lad
decided
to
let
me
*NL*
in
;
and
opening
the
door
wider
for
that
purpose
,
admitted
me
,
first
,
*NL*
into
a
little
closet
of
a
hall
,
and
next
into
a
little
sitting-room
;
*NL*
where
I
came
into
the
presence
of
my
old
friend
-LRB-
also
out
of
breath
-RRB-
,
*NL*
seated
at
a
table
,
and
bending
over
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
Traddles
,
looking
up
.
``
It
's
Copperfield
!
''
and
rushed
*NL*
into
my
arms
,
where
I
held
him
tight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
well
,
my
dear
Traddles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
well
,
my
dear
,
dear
Copperfield
,
and
nothing
but
good
news
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
cried
with
pleasure
,
both
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Traddles
,
rumpling
his
hair
in
his
excitement
,
*NL*
which
was
a
most
unnecessary
operation
,
``
my
dearest
Copperfield
,
my
*NL*
long-lost
and
most
welcome
friend
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
How
brown
*NL*
you
are
!
How
glad
I
am
!
Upon
my
life
and
honor
,
I
never
was
so
rejoiced
,
*NL*
my
beloved
Copperfield
,
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
express
my
emotions
.
I
was
quite
unable
to
*NL*
speak
,
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
!
''
said
Traddles
.
``
And
grown
so
famous
!
My
glorious
*NL*
Copperfield
!
Good
gracious
me
,
_
when
_
did
you
come
,
_
where
_
have
you
*NL*
come
from
,
_
what
_
have
you
been
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
pausing
for
an
answer
to
anything
he
said
,
Traddles
,
who
had
*NL*
clapped
me
into
an
easy
chair
by
the
fire
,
all
this
time
impetuously
*NL*
stirred
the
fire
with
one
hand
,
and
pulled
at
my
neck-kerchief
with
the
*NL*
other
,
under
some
wild
delusion
that
it
was
a
great
coat
.
Without
*NL*
putting
down
the
poker
,
he
now
hugged
me
again
;
and
I
hugged
him
;
and
,
*NL*
both
laughing
,
and
both
wiping
our
eyes
,
we
both
sat
down

and
shook
*NL*
hands
across
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think

said
Traddles
,
``
that
you

have
been
so
nearly
coming

home

been

not
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ceremony
,
my
dear
Traddles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
me

cried
Traddles
,
opening
his
eyes
in
his
old
way
.
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
get
my
last
letter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

Why

my

said
Traddles
,
sticking
his
hair
upright
*NL*
with
both
hands
,
and
then
putting
his
hands
on
my
knees
,
``
I
am
married

*NL*
*NL*
``
Married

I
cried
,
joyfully
!
*NL*
*NL*

Lord
bless
me

yes

said
Traddles

``
by
the
Reverend

's
behind

Look
here

*NL*
*NL*
To
my
amazement
,
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
came
at
that

*NL*
instant
,
laughing
and
blushing
,
from
her
place
of
concealment

And
a
*NL*
more
cheerful

happy

bright-looking

I
believe
*NL*
-LRB-

I
could
not

saying
on
the
spot
-RRB-
the
world
never
saw

I
kissed
*NL*
her
as
an

acquaintance
should

wished
them
joy
with
all
my
might
*NL*
of
heart

*NL*

I.

*NL*
``
The

Traddles

``
Sophy

sisters

They
are
staying
with
us

They
have
come
to
have
a
peep

The
fact

Traddles

I
was
romping

with
the

In
point

we
were
playing
at
Puss
in
the
Corner

*NL*
But
as
that
would
n't
do
in
Westminster
Hall
,
and
as
it
would
n't
look
*NL*
quite
professional
if
they
were
seen
by
a
client

they
decamped
.
And
*NL*
they
are
now

listening

I
have
no

glancing
at
*NL*
the
door

another
room

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry

said
I

laughing
afresh

have
occasioned
such
a

dispersion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my

greatly
delighted

pick
up
the
combs
they

dropped
out
of
their
hair

going
on
in

the
maddest
manner

you
would
n't
have
said
so
.
My
love
,
will
you
fetch
*NL*
the
girls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophy
tripped
away
,
and
we
heard
her
received
in
the
adjoining
room
with
*NL*
a
peal
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
musical
,
is
n't
it
,
my
dear
Copperfield
?
''
said
Traddles
.
``
It
's
*NL*
very
agreeable
to
hear
.
It
quite
lights
up
these
old
rooms
.
To
an
*NL*
unfortunate
bachelor
of
a
fellow
who
has
lived
alone
all
his
life
,
you
*NL*
know
,
it
's
positively
delicious
.
It
's
charming
.
Poor
things
,
they
have
*NL*
had
a
great
loss
in
Sophy
--
who
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Copperfield
,
is
,
and
*NL*
ever
was
,
the
dearest
girl
!
--
and
it
gratifies
me
beyond
expression
to
*NL*
find
them
in
such
good
spirits
.
The
society
of
girls
is
a
very
*NL*
delightful
thing
,
Copperfield
.
It
's
not
professional
,
but
it
's
very
*NL*
delightful

*NL*
*NL*
Observing
that
he
slightly
faltered
,
and
comprehending
that
in
the
*NL*
goodness
of
his
heart
he
was
fearful
of
giving
me
some
pain
by
what
he
*NL*
had
said
,
I
expressed
my
concurrence
with
a
heartiness
that
evidently
*NL*
relieved
and
pleased
him
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
,
''
said
Traddles
,
``
our
domestic
arrangements
are

to
say
the

quite
unprofessional
altogether
,
my

Even
*NL*
Sophy
's
being
here
,
is
unprofessional
.
And
we
have
no
other
place
of

.
We
have
put
to
sea
in
a
cockboat
,

we
are
quite
prepared

*NL*
rough
it

And
Sophy
's
an
extraordinary
manager
!
You
'll
be
surprised
how
*NL*
those

are
stowed
away

I
am
sure
I
hardly

it

done

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
many

I
inquired

*NL*
*NL*

The

*NL*
``
Indeed

cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Traddles
.
``
Now
the
whole
set
--
I
mean
the
chambers

is
only
*NL*
three
rooms
;
but
Sophy
arranges
for
the
girls
in
the
most
wonderful
way

*NL*

they
sleep
as
comfortably
as
possible

Three

said
*NL*
Traddles

pointing
.
``
Two

*NL*
I
could
not
help
glancing
round

in
search
of
the
accommodation

remaining
for
Mr.

Traddles
understood
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!

said
Traddles

we
are
prepared

rough
it

just
now

we

improvise
a
bed
last
week

upon

there

*NL*
a
little
room
in

roof

a
very
nice
room

when
you
're
up
there

which
*NL*
Sophy
papered
herself
,
to
surprise
me
;
and
that
's
our
room
at
present
.
*NL*
It
's
a
capital
little
gipsey
sort
of
place

There
's
quite
a
view
from

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

Traddles

nodding
triumphantly
at
the
flower-pot
*NL*
and
stand
;

there
's
the
table
with
the
marble
top

All
the

plain

you
perceive

And
as

so
much
as

I

cheerfully

Traddles

Of
course
we
have

something

Traddles

``
You

''
*NL*
falling
again
into
the
low
confidential
tone
,
``
after
I
had
delivered
my
*NL*
argument
in
DOE

dem
_
JIPES
_
versus
_
WIGZELL
,
which
did
me
great
service
*NL*
with
the
profession
,
I
went
down
into
Devonshire
,
and
had
some
serious
*NL*
conversation
in
private
with
the
Reverend
Horace
.
I
dwelt
upon
the
fact
*NL*
that
Sophy
--
who
I
do
assure
you
,
Copperfield
,
is
the
dearest
girl
!

*NL*
*NL*

I
am
certain

!

I.

*NL*

She
is
,
indeed
!

rejoined
Traddles
.
``
But
I
am
afraid
I
am
wandering
*NL*
from
the
subject
.
Did
I
mention
the
Reverend
Horace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
that
you
dwelt
upon
the
fact
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
!
Upon
the
fact
that
Sophy
and
I
had
been
engaged
for
a
long
*NL*
period
,
and
that
Sophy
,
with
the
permission
of
her
parents
,
was
more
*NL*
than
content
to
take
me
--
in
short
,
''
said
Traddles
,
with
his
old
frank
*NL*
smile
,
``
on
our
present
Britannia-metal
footing
.
Very
well
.
I
then
*NL*
proposed
to
the
Reverend
Horace
--
who
is
a
most
excellent
clergyman
,
*NL*
Copperfield
,
and
ought
to
be
a
Bishop
;
or
at
least
ought
to
have
enough
*NL*
to
live
upon
,
without
pinching
himself
--
that
if
I
could
turn
the
corner
,
*NL*
say
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
in
one
year
;
and
could
see
my
way
*NL*
pretty
clearly
to
that
,
or
something
better
,
next
year
;
and
could
*NL*
plainly
furnish
a
little
place
like
this
,
besides
;
then
,
and
in
that
*NL*
case
,
Sophy
and
I
should
be
united
.
I
took
the
liberty
of
representing
*NL*
that
we
had
been
patient
for
a
good
many
years
;
and
that
the
*NL*
circumstance
of
Sophy
's
being
extraordinarily
useful
at
home
,
ought
not
*NL*
to
operate
,
with
her
affectionate
parents
,
against
her
establishment
in
*NL*
life
--
do
n't
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
it
ought
not
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
think
so

Copperfield
,
''
rejoined
Traddles
,
``
because
,
*NL*
without
any
imputation
on
the
Reverend
Horace
,
I
do
think
parents
,
and
*NL*
brothers
,
and
so
forth
,
are
sometimes
rather
selfish
in
such
cases
.
*NL*
Well
!
I
also
pointed
out
,
that
my
most
earnest
desire
was
,
to
be
useful
*NL*
to
the
family
;
and
that
if
I
got
on
in
the
world
,
and
anything
should
*NL*
happen
to
him
--
I
refer
to
the
Reverend
Horace

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

I.
*NL*
*NL*

--
Or
to
Mrs.

it
would
be
the
utmost
gratification
of
my
*NL*
wishes
,
to
be
a
parent
to
the
girls
.
He
replied
in
a
most
admirable
*NL*
manner
,
exceedingly
flattering
to
my
feelings
,
and
undertook
to
obtain
*NL*
the
consent
of
Mrs.
Crewler
to
this
arrangement
.
They
had
a
dreadful
*NL*
time
of
it
with
her
.
It
mounted
from
her
legs
into
her
chest
,
and
then
*NL*
into
her
head
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mounted
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
grief
,
''
replied
Traddles
,
with
a
serious
look
.
``
Her
feelings
*NL*
generally
.
As
I
mentioned
on
a
former
occasion
,
she
is
a
very
superior
*NL*
woman
,
but
has
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
.
Whatever
occurs
to
harass
her
,
*NL*
usually
settles
in
her
legs
;
but
on
this
occasion
it
mounted
to
the
*NL*
chest
,
and
then
to
the
head
,
and
,
in
short
,
pervaded
the
whole
system
in
*NL*
a
most
alarming
manner
.
However
,
they
brought
her
through
it
by
*NL*
unremitting
and
affectionate
attention
;
and
we
were
married
yesterday
*NL*
six
weeks
.
You
have
no
idea
what
a
Monster
I
felt
,
Copperfield
,
when
I
*NL*
saw
the
whole
family
crying
and
fainting
away
in
every
direction
!
Mrs.
*NL*
Crewler
could
n't
see
me
before
we
left
--
could
n't
forgive
me
,
then
,
for
*NL*
depriving
her
of
her
child
--
but
she
is
a
good
creature
,
and
has
done
so
*NL*
since
.
I
had
a
delightful
letter
from
her
,
only
this
morning
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
short
,
my
dear
friend

said
I
,
``
you
feel
as
blest

you
*NL*
deserve
to
feel

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

your
partiality

laughed
Traddles
.
``
But
,
indeed
,
I
am
in
a
*NL*
most
enviable
state

I
work
hard

insatiably

I
get
up
at

five
every
morning

do
n't

it
at
all

I
hide
the

in

day-time

make
merry
with
them
in
the
evening

And
I
assure

quite
sorry

they
are
going
home

breaking
off

in

confidence

speaking
aloud

were
a

looked
so
wholesome

fresh

*NL*
They
were
all
pretty

and
Miss
Caroline
was
very
handsome

there
was
*NL*
a
loving

cheerful
,
fireside
quality
in
Sophy

bright
looks
,
which
was
*NL*
better
than
that
,
and
which
assured
me
that
my

had
chosen
well

We
all
sat
round
the
fire
;
while
the
sharp
boy

who
I
now
divined
had
*NL*
lost
his
breath
in
putting
the
papers
out

cleared
them
away
again

produced
the
tea-things
.
After
that
,
he
retired
for
the
night
,
shutting
*NL*
the
outer-door
upon
us
with
a
bang
.
Mrs.
Traddles
,
with
perfect
pleasure
*NL*
and
composure
beaming
from
her
household
eyes
,
having
made
the
tea
,
then
*NL*
quietly
made
the
toast
as
she
sat
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
seen
Agnes
,
she
told
me
while
she
was
toasting
.
``
Tom
''
had
taken
*NL*
her
down
into
Kent
for
a
wedding
trip
,
and
there
she
had
seen
my
aunt
,
*NL*
too
;
and
both
my
aunt
and
Agnes
were
well
,
and
they
had
all
talked
of
*NL*
nothing
but
me
.
``
Tom
''
had
never
had
me
out
of
his
thoughts
,
she
really
*NL*
believed
,
all
the
time
I
had
been
away
.
``
Tom
''
was
the
authority
for
*NL*
everything
.
``
Tom
''
was
evidently
the
idol
of
her
life
;
never
to
be
shaken
*NL*
on
his
pedestal
by
any
commotion
;
always
to
be
believed
in
,
and
done
*NL*
homage
to
with
the
whole
faith
of
her
heart
,
come
what
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deference
which
both
she
and
Traddles
showed
towards
the
Beauty
,
*NL*
pleased
me
very
much
.
I
do
n't
know
that
I
thought
it
very
reasonable
;
*NL*
but
I
thought
it
very
delightful
,
and
essentially
a
part
of
their
*NL*
character
.
If
Traddles
ever
for
an
instant
missed
the
teaspoons
that
*NL*
were
still
to
be
won
,
I
have
no
doubt
it
was
when
he
handed
the
Beauty
*NL*
her
tea
.
If
his
sweet-tempered
wife
could
have
got
up
any
self-assertion
*NL*
against
any
one
,
I
am
satisfied
it
could
only
have
been
because
she
was
*NL*
the
Beauty
's
sister
.
A
few
slight
indications
of
a
rather
petted
and
*NL*
capricious
manner
,
which
I
observed
in
the
Beauty
,
were
manifestly
*NL*
considered
,
by
Traddles
and
his
wife
,
as
her
birthright
and
natural
*NL*
endowment
.
If
she
had
been
born
a
Queen
Bee
,
and
they
laboring
Bees
,
*NL*
they
could
not
have
been
more
satisfied
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
their
self-forgetfulness
charmed
me
.
Their
pride
in
these
girls
,
and
*NL*
their
submission
of
themselves
to
all
their
whims
,
was
the
pleasantest
*NL*
little
testimony
to
their
own
worth
I
could
have
desired
to
see
.
If
*NL*
Traddles
were
addressed
as
``
a
darling
,
''
once
in
the
course
of
that
*NL*
evening
;
and
besought
to
bring
something
here
,
or
carry
something
there
,
*NL*
or
take
something
up
,
or
put
something
down
,
or
find
something
,
or
fetch
*NL*
something
;
he
was
so
addressed
,
by
one
or
other
of
his
sisters-in-law
,
*NL*
at
least
twelve
times
in
an
hour
.
Neither
could
they
do
anything
without
*NL*
Sophy
.
Somebody
's
hair
fell
down
,
and
nobody
but
Sophy
could
put
it
up
.
*NL*
Somebody
forgot
how
a
particular
tune
went
,
and
nobody
but
Sophy
could
*NL*
hum
that
tune
right
.
Somebody
wanted
to
recal
the
name
of
a
place
in
*NL*
Devonshire
,
and
only
Sophy
knew
it
.
Something
was
wanted
to
be
written
*NL*
home
,
and
Sophy
alone
could
be
trusted
to
write
before
breakfast
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
Somebody
broke
down
in
a
piece
of
knitting
,
and
no
one
but
*NL*
Sophy
was
able
to
put
the
defaulter
in
the
right
direction
.
They
were
*NL*
entire
mistresses
of
the
place
,
and
Sophy
and
Traddles
waited
on
them
.
*NL*
How
many
children
Sophy
could
have
taken
care
of
in
her
time
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
;
but
she
seemed
to
be
famous
for
knowing
every
sort
of
song
that
*NL*
ever
was
addressed
to
a
child
in
the
English
tongue
;
and
she
sang
dozens
*NL*
to
order
with
the
clearest
little
voice
in
the
world
,
one
after
another
*NL*
-LRB-
every
sister
issuing
directions
for
a
different
tune
,
and
the
Beauty
*NL*
generally
striking
in
last
-RRB-
,
so
that
I
was
quite
fascinated
.
The
best
of
*NL*
all
was
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
their
exactions
,
all
the
sisters
had
a
*NL*
great
tenderness
and
respect
both
for
Sophy
and
Traddles
.
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
when
I
took
my
leave
,
and
Traddles
was
coming
out
to
walk
with
me
to
the
*NL*
coffee-house
,
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
an
obstinate
head
of
hair
,
or
*NL*
any
other
head
of
hair
,
rolling
about
in
such
a
shower
of
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altogether
,
it
was
a
scene
I
could
not
help
dwelling
on
with
pleasure
,
*NL*
for
a
long
time
after
I
got
back
and
had
wished
Traddles
good
night
.
If
*NL*
I
had
beheld
a
thousand
roses
blowing
in
a
top
set
of
chambers
,
in
that
*NL*
withered
Gray
's
Inn
,
they
could
not
have
brightened
it
half
so
much
.
The
*NL*
idea
of
those
Devonshire
girls
,
among
the
dry
law-stationers
and
the
*NL*
attornies
'
offices
;
and
of
the
tea
and
toast
,
and
children
's
songs
,
in
*NL*
that
grim
atmosphere
of
pounce
and
parchment
,
red-tape
,
dusty
wafers
,
*NL*
ink-jars
,
brief
and
draft
paper
,
law
reports
,
writs
,
declarations
,
and
*NL*
bills
of
costs
;
seemed
almost
as
pleasantly
fanciful
as
if
I
had
dreamed
*NL*
that
the
Sultan
's
famous
family
had
been
admitted
on
the
roll
of
*NL*
attorneys
,
and
had
brought
the
talking
bird
,
the
singing
tree
,
and
the
*NL*
golden
water
into
Gray
's
Inn
Hall
.
Somehow
,
I
found
that
I
had
taken
*NL*
leave
of
Traddles
for
the
night
,
and
come
back
to
the
coffee-house
,
with
*NL*
a
great
change
in
my
despondency
about
him
.
I
began
to
think
he
would
*NL*
get
on
,
in
spite
of
all
the
many
orders
of
chief
waiters
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drawing
a
chair
before
one
of
the
coffee-room
fires
to
think
about
him
*NL*
at
my
leisure
,
I
gradually
fell
from
the
consideration
of
his
happiness
*NL*
to
tracing
prospects
in
the
live-coals
,
and
to
thinking
,
as
they
broke
*NL*
and
changed
,
of
the
principal
vicissitudes
and
separations
that
had
*NL*
marked
my
life
.
I
had
not
seen
a
coal
fire
,
since
I
had
left
England
*NL*
three
years
ago
:
though
many
a
wood
fire
had
I
watched
,
as
it
crumbled
*NL*
into
hoary
ashes
,
and
mingled
with
the
feathery
heap
upon
the
hearth
,
*NL*
which
not
inaptly
figured
to
me
,
in
my
despondency
,
my
own
dead
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
think
of
the
past
now
,
gravely
,
but
not
bitterly
;
and
could
*NL*
contemplate
the
future
in
a
brave
spirit
.
Home
,
in
its
best
sense
,
was
*NL*
for
me
no
more
.
She
in
whom
I
might
have
inspired
a
dearer
love
,
I
had
*NL*
taught
to
be
my
sister
.
She
would
marry
,
and
would
have
new
claimants
on
*NL*
her
tenderness
;
and
in
doing
it
,
would
never
know
the
love
for
her
that
*NL*
had
grown
up
in
my
heart
.
It
was
right
that
I
should
pay
the
forfeit
of
*NL*
my
headlong
passion
.
What
I
reaped
,
I
had
sown
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
thinking
,
And
had
I
truly
disciplined
my
heart
to
this
,
and
could
*NL*
I
resolutely
bear
it
,
and
calmly
hold
the
place
in
her
home
which
she
*NL*
had
calmly
held
in
mine
,
--
when
I
found
my
eyes
resting
on
a
countenance
*NL*
that
might
have
arisen
out
of
the
fire
,
in
its
association
with
my
early
*NL*
remembrances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Mr.
Chillip
the
Doctor
,
to
whose
good
offices
I
was
indebted
in
*NL*
the
very
first
chapter
of
this
history
,
sat
reading
a
newspaper
in
the
*NL*
shadow
of
an
opposite
corner
.
He
was
tolerably
stricken
in
years
by
this
*NL*
time
;
but
,
being
a
mild
,
meek
,
calm
little
man
,
had
worn
so
easily
,
that
*NL*
I
thought
he
looked
at
that
moment
just
as
he
might
have
looked
when
he
*NL*
sat
in
our
parlor
,
waiting
for
me
to
be
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
had
left
Blunderstone
six
or
seven
years
ago
,
and
I
had
*NL*
never
seen
him
since
.
He
sat
placidly
perusing
the
newspaper
,
with
his
*NL*
little
head
on
one
side
,
and
a
glass
of
warm
sherry
negus
at
his
elbow
.
*NL*
He
was
so
extremely
conciliatory
in
his
manner
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
apologise
to
the
very
newspaper
for
taking
the
liberty
of
reading
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
up
to
where
he
was
sitting
,
and
said
,
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
*NL*
Chillip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
greatly
fluttered
by
this
unexpected
address
from
a
stranger
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
in
his
slow
way
,
``
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
you
are
very
good
.
Thank
*NL*
you
,
sir
.
I
hope
_
you
_
are
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
remember
me
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Chillip
,
smiling
very
meekly
,
and
shaking
his
*NL*
head
as
he
surveyed
me
,
``
I
have
a
kind
of
an
impression
that
something
*NL*
in
your
countenance
is
familiar
to
me
,
sir
;
but
I
could
n't
lay
my
hand
*NL*
upon
your
name
,
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
knew
it
,
long
before
I
knew
it
myself
,
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
indeed
,
sir
?
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
.
``
Is
it
possible
that
I
had
the
*NL*
honor
,
sir
,
of
officiating
when
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
cried
Mr.
Chillip
.
``
But
no
doubt
you
are
a
good
deal
changed
*NL*
since
then
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
observed
Mr.
Chillip
,
``
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
,
if
I
am
*NL*
compelled
to
ask
the
favor
of
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
telling
him
my
name
,
he
was
really
moved
.
He
quite
shook
hands
*NL*
with
me
--
which
was
a
violent
proceeding
for
him
,
his
usual
course
being
*NL*
to
slide
a
tepid
little
fish-slice
,
an
inch
or
two
in
advance
of
his
*NL*
hip
,
and
evince
the
greatest
discomposure
when
anybody
grappled
with
it
.
*NL*
Even
now
,
he
put
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
as
soon
as
he
could
*NL*
disengage
it
,
and
seemed
relieved
when
he
had
got
it
safe
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
sir
!
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
surveying
me
with
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
.
``
And
it
's
Mr.
Copperfield
,
is
it
?
Well
,
sir
,
I
think
I
should
have
*NL*
known
you
,
if
I
had
taken
the
liberty
of
looking
more
closely
at
you
.
*NL*
There
's
a
strong
resemblance
between
you
and
your
poor
father
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
my
father
,
''
I
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
``
And
very
much
*NL*
to
be
deplored
it
was
,
on
all
accounts
!
We
are
not
ignorant
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
,
slowly
shaking
his
little
head
again
,
``
down
in
our
part
of
*NL*
the
country
,
of
your
fame
.
There
must
be
great
excitement
here
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
tapping
himself
on
the
forehead
with
his
forefinger
.
*NL*
``
You
must
find
it
a
trying
occupation
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
part
of
the
country
now
?
''
I
asked
,
seating
myself
near
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
established
within
a
few
miles
of
Bury
St.
Edmunds
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Chillip
.
``
Mrs.
Chillip
,
coming
into
a
little
property
in
that
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
under
her
father
's
will
,
I
bought
a
practice
down
there
,
*NL*
in
which
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
I
am
doing
well
.
My
daughter
is
*NL*
growing
quite
a
tall
lass
now
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
giving
his
little
*NL*
head
another
little
shake
.
``
Her
mother
let
down
two
tucks
in
her
frocks
*NL*
only
last
week

Such
is
Time

,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
little
man
put
his
now
empty
glass
to
his
lips
,
when
he
made
this
*NL*
reflection
,
I
proposed
to
him
to
have
it
refilled
,
and
I
would
keep
him
*NL*
company
with
another
.
``
Well
,
sir

''
he
returned
in
his
slow
way
,
``
it
's
*NL*
more
than
I
am
accustomed
to
;
but
I
ca
n't
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
your
conversation
.
It
seems
but
yesterday
that
I
had
the
honor
of
*NL*
attending
you
in
the
measles
.
You
came
through
them
charmingly
,
sir
!

*NL*
*NL*
I
acknowledged
this
compliment
,
and
ordered
the
negus
,
which
was
soon
*NL*
produced
.
``
Quite
an
uncommon
dissipation
!
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
stirring
*NL*
it
,
``
but
I
ca
n't
resist
so
extraordinary
an
occasion

You
have
no
*NL*
family
,

*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
aware
that
you
sustained
a
bereavement
,
sir
,
some
time
ago

''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
.
``
I
heard
it
from
your
father-in-law

Very
decided

character
there
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes

''
said
I
,
``
decided
enough

Where
did
you
see
her

Mr.

Chillip

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
aware

''
returned
Mr.
Chillip
,
with
his
placidest
*NL*
smile
,
``
that
your

again
a
neighbour
of
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
indeed

said
Mr.

``
Married
a

good
little
property
,
poor
thing

--
And
this
action
of
*NL*
the
brain
now
,
sir
?
Do
n't
you
find
it
fatigue
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Chillip
,
*NL*
looking
at
me
like
an
admiring
Robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
waived
that
question
,
and
returned
to
the
Murdstones
.
``
I
was
aware
of
*NL*
his
being
married
again
.
Do
you
attend
the
family
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
regularly
.
I
have
been
called
in
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Strong
*NL*
phrenological
development
of
the
organ
of
firmness

in
Mr.
Murdstone
and
*NL*
his
sister

sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
with
such
an
expressive
look
,
that
Mr.
Chillip
was
emboldened
*NL*
by
that
,
and
the
negus
together
,
to
give
his
head
several
short
shakes
,
*NL*
and
thoughtfully
exclaim
,
``
Ah
,
dear
me
!
We
remember
old
times
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
brother
and
sister
are
pursuing
their
old
course

are
they
?

*NL*
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

sir

''
replied
Mr.
Chillip
,
``
a
medical
man
,
being
so
much
in
*NL*
families
,
ought
to
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
anything
but
his
*NL*
profession
.
Still
,
I
must
say
,
they
are
very
severe
,
sir
:
both
as
to
*NL*
this
life
and
the
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
will
be
regulated
without
much
reference
to
them
,
I
dare
say
,

*NL*
I
returned
:
``
what
are
they
doing
as
to
this
?

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
shook
his
head
,
stirred
his
negus
,
and
sipped
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
charming

he
observed
in

plaintive
manner

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
present
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

said
Mr.
Chillip
;
``
as
amiable

I
am
*NL*
sure

as
it
was
possible
to
be
!
Mrs.

's
opinion
is
,
that
her

spirit
has
been
entirely
broken
since
her
marriage

that
she
is
all

melancholy
mad

Mr.

timorously
,
*NL*

said
I.

And
she
has
been

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

there
were
violent
quarrels
at
first

I
assure
you

said
*NL*
Mr.
Chillip
;

she
is
quite
a
shadow
now

Would
it
be
considered
*NL*
forward

I
was
to
say
to
you
,
sir
,
in
confidence
,
that
since
the
*NL*
sister
came
to
help
,
the
brother
and
sister
between
them
have
nearly
*NL*
reduced
her
to
a
state
of
imbecility

*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
could
easily
believe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
hesitation

said
Mr.

fortifying
himself
*NL*
with
another
sip
of
negus
,
``
between
you

me

that
her

made
Mrs.

nearly
imbecile

She
was
a
lively
young

before

their
gloom

destroyed

They
go
about

That
was
Mrs.

remark
to
me

only
last
week

I
assure
you

I
inquired

*NL*
``
You

Mr.

his

the

he
was
indulging

he
proceeded

calmest

quite
electrified

pointing
out

up
an
image

it

much
encouraged
,
``
that

a
vent

do
you
know
I
must
say
,
*NL*
sir

he
continued
,
mildly
laying
his
head
on
one
side
,
``
that
I

*NL*
``
In

said
Mr.

``
they

much
disliked

as
they

very
free

perdition

we
really
have
a
good
deal
of
perdition
going
on
in
our
*NL*
neighbourhood
!
However
,
as
Mrs.
Chillip
says
,
sir

they
undergo
a
*NL*
continual
punishment
;
for
they
are
turned
inward

feed

you

returning

Do
n't
you
expose
it
*NL*
to
a
good
deal
of
excitement
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
it
not
difficult
,
in
the
excitement
of
Mr.
Chillip
's
own
brain
,
*NL*
under
his
potations
of
negus
,
to
divert
his
attention
from
this
topic
to
*NL*
his
own
affairs
,
on
which
,
for
the
next
half
hour
,
he
was
quite
*NL*
loquacious
;
giving
me
to
understand
,
among
other
pieces
of
information
,
*NL*
that
he
was
then
at
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee-house
to
lay
his
professional
*NL*
evidence
before
a
Commission
of
Lunacy
,
touching
the
state
of
mind
of
a
*NL*
patient
who
had
become
deranged
from
excessive
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
am
extremely
nervous
on
such
*NL*
occasions
.
I
could
not
support
being
what
is
called
Bullied
,
sir
.
It
*NL*
would
quite
unman
me
.
Do
you
know
it
was
some
time
before
I
recovered
*NL*
the
conduct
of
that
alarming
lady
,
on
the
night
of
your
birth
,
Mr.
*NL*
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
that
I
was
going
down
to
my
aunt
,
the
Dragon
of
that
night
,
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
;
and
that
she
was
one
of
the
most
tender-hearted
*NL*
and
excellent
of
women
,
as
he
would
know
full
well
if
he
knew
her
*NL*
better
.
The
mere
notion
of
the
possibility
of
his
ever
seeing
her
again
,
*NL*
appeared
to
terrify
him
.
He
replied
,
with
a
small
pale
smile
,
``
Is
she
*NL*
so
,
indeed
,
sir
?
Really
?
''
and
almost
immediately
called
for
a
candle
,
*NL*
and
went
to
bed
,
as
if
he
were
not
quite
safe
anywhere
else
.
He
did
not
*NL*
actually
stagger
under
the
negus
;
but
I
should
think
his
placid
little
*NL*
pulse
must
have
made
two
or
three
more
beats
in
a
minute
,
than
it
had
*NL*
done
since
the
great
night
of
my
aunt
's
disappointment
,
when
she
struck
*NL*
at
him
with
her
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoroughly
tired
,
I
went
to
bed
too
,
at
midnight
;
passed
the
next
day
on
*NL*
the
Dover
coach
;
burst
safe
and
sound
into
my
aunt
's
old
parlor
while
*NL*
she
was
at
tea
-LRB-
she
wore
spectacles
now
-RRB-
;
and
was
received
by
her
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Dick
,
and
dear
old
Peggotty
,
who
acted
as
housekeeper
,
with
open
*NL*
arms
and
tears
of
joy
.
My
aunt
was
mightily
amused
,
when
we
began
to
*NL*
talk
composedly
,
by
my
account
of
my
meeting
with
Mr.
Chillip
,
and
of
*NL*
his
holding
her
in
such
dread
remembrance
;
and
both
she
and
Peggotty
had
*NL*
a
great
deal
to
say
about
my
poor
mother
's
second
husband
,
and
``
that
*NL*
murdering
woman
of
a
sister
,
''
--
on
whom
I
think
no
pain
or
penalty
would
*NL*
have
induced
my
aunt
to
bestow
any
Christian
or
Proper
Name
,
or
any
*NL*
other
designation

CHAPTER
LX
.
*NL*
*NL*
AGNES
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
and
I
,
when
we
were
left
alone
,
talked
far
into
the
night
.
How
*NL*
the
emigrants
never
wrote
home
,
otherwise
than
cheerfully
and
hopefully
;
*NL*
how
Mr.
Micawber
had
actually
remitted
divers
small
sums
of
money
,
on
*NL*
account
of
those
``
pecuniary
liabilities
,
''
in
reference
to
which
he
had
*NL*
been
so
business-like
as
between
man
and
man
;
how
Janet
,
returning
into
*NL*
my
aunt
's
service
when
she
came
back
to
Dover
,
had
finally
carried
out
*NL*
her
renunciation
of
mankind
by
entering
into
wedlock
with
a
thriving
*NL*
tavern-keeper
;
and
how
my
aunt
had
finally
set
_
her
_
seal
on
the
same
*NL*
great
principle
,
by
aiding
and
abetting
the
bride
,
and
crowning
the
*NL*
marriage-ceremony
with
her
presence
;
were
among
our
topics
--
already
more
*NL*
or
less
familiar
to
me
through
the
letters
I
had
had
.
Mr.
Dick
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
was
not
forgotten
.
My
aunt
informed
me
how
he
incessantly
*NL*
occupied
himself
in
copying
everything
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
,
and
*NL*
kept
King
Charles
the
First
at
a
respectful
distance
by
that
semblance
*NL*
of
employment
;
how
it
was
one
of
the
main
joys
and
rewards
of
her
life
*NL*
that
he
was
free
and
happy
,
instead
of
pining
in
monotonous
restraint
;
*NL*
and
how
-LRB-
as
a
novel
general
conclusion
-RRB-
nobody
but
she
could
ever
fully
*NL*
know
what
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
,
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
patting
the
back
of
my
hand
,
as
we
sat
*NL*
in
our
old
way
before
the
fire
,
``
when
are
you
going
over
to
Canterbury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
get
a
horse
,
and
ride
over
to-morrow
morning
,
aunt
,
unless
you
*NL*
will
go
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
in
her
short
abrupt
way
.
``
I
mean
to
stay
where
I
*NL*
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
I
should
ride
,
I
said
.
I
could
not
have
come
through
Canterbury
*NL*
to-day
without
stopping
,
if
I
had
been
coming
to
anyone
but
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pleased
,
but
answered
,
``
Tut
,
Trot
;
_
my
_
old
bones
would
have
*NL*
kept
till
to-morrow
!
''
and
softly
patted
my
hand
again
,
as
I
sat
looking
*NL*
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoughtfully
,
for
I
could
not
be
here
once
more
,
and
so
near
Agnes
,
*NL*
without
the
revival
of
those
regrets
with
which
I
had
so
long
been
*NL*
occupied
.
Softened
regrets
they
might
be
,
teaching
me
what
I
had
failed
*NL*
to
learn
when
my
younger
life
was
all
before
me
,
but
not
the
less
*NL*
regrets
.
``
Oh
,
Trot
,
''
I
seemed
to
hear
my
aunt
say
once
more
;
and
I
*NL*
understood
her
better
now
--
``
Blind
,
blind
,
blind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
both
kept
silence
for
some
minutes
.
When
I
raised
my
eyes
,
I
found
*NL*
that
she
was
steadily
observant
of
me
.
Perhaps
she
had
followed
the
*NL*
current
of
my
mind
;
for
it
seemed
to
me
an
easy
one
to
track
now
,
wilful
*NL*
as
it
had
been
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
her
father
a
white-haired
old
man
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
though
*NL*
a
better
man
in
all
other
respects
--
a
reclaimed
man
.
Neither
will
you
*NL*
find
him
measuring
all
human
interests
,
and
joys
,
and
sorrows
,
with
his
*NL*
one
poor
little
inch-rule
now
.
Trust
me
,
child
,
such
things
must
shrink
*NL*
very
much
,
before
they
can
be
measured
off
in
_
that
_
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
they
must
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
her
,
''
pursued
my
aunt
,
``
as
good
,
as
beautiful
,
as
*NL*
earnest
,
as
disinterested
,
as
she
has
always
been

If
I
knew
higher
*NL*
praise
,
Trot
,
I
would
bestow
it
on
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
higher
praise
for
her
;
no
higher
reproach
for
me
.
O
,
how
*NL*
had
I
strayed
so
far
away
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
trains
the
young
girls
whom
she
has
about
her
,
to
be
like
*NL*
herself
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
earnest
even
to
the
filling
of
her
eyes
with
*NL*
tears
,
``
Heaven
knows
,
her
life
will
be
well
employed
!
Useful
and
happy
,
*NL*
as
she
said
that
day
!
How
could
she
be
otherwise
than
useful

happy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Agnes
any
--
''
I
was
thinking
aloud
,
rather
than
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
Hey
?
Any
what
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
lover
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
score
,
''
cried
my
aunt
,
with
a
kind
of
indignant
pride
.
``
She
might
*NL*
have
married
twenty
times
,
my
dear
,
since
you
have
been
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
''
said
I.
``
No
doubt
.
But
has
she
any
lover
who
is
worthy
of
*NL*
her
?
Agnes
could
care
for
no
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
sat
musing
for
a
little
while
,
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
.
*NL*
Slowly
raising
her
eyes
to
mine
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
she
has
an
attachment
,
Trot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
prosperous
one
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trot
,
''
returned
my
aunt
gravely
,
``
I
ca
n't
say
.
I
have
no
right
to
tell
*NL*
you
even
so
much
.
She
has
never
confided
it
to
me
,
but
I
suspect
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
so
attentively
and
anxiously
at
me
-LRB-
I
even
saw
her
tremble
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
I
felt
now
,
more
than
ever
,
that
she
had
followed
my
late
thoughts
.
*NL*
I
summoned
all
the
resolutions
I
had
made
,
in
all
those
many
days
and
*NL*
nights
,
and
all
those
many
conflicts
of
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
should
be
so
,
''
I
began
,
``
and
I
hope
it
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
is
,
''
said
my
aunt
curtly
.
``
You
must
not
be
ruled
*NL*
by
my
suspicions
.
You
must
keep
them
secret
.
They
are
very
slight
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
I
have
no
right
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
should
be
so
,
''
I
repeated
,
``
Agnes
will
tell
me
at
her
own
good
*NL*
time
.
A
sister
to
whom
I
have
confided
so
much
,
aunt
,
will
not
be
*NL*
reluctant
to
confide
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
withdrew
her
eyes
from
mine
,
as
slowly
as
she
had
turned
them
*NL*
upon
me
;
and
covered
them
thoughtfully
with
her
hand
.
By
and
by
she
put
*NL*
her
other
hand
on
my
shoulder
;
and
so
we
both
sat
,
looking
into
the
*NL*
past
,
without
saying
another
word
,
until
we
parted
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rode
away
,
early
in
the
morning
,
for
the
scene
of
my
old
school
days
.
*NL*
I
can
not
say
that
I
was
yet
quite
happy
,
in
the
hope
that
I
was
gaining
*NL*
a
victory
over
myself
;
even
in
the
prospect
of
so
soon
looking
on
her
*NL*
face
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
well-remembered
ground
was
soon
traversed
,
and
I
came
into
the
*NL*
quiet
streets
,
where
every
stone
was
a
boy
's
book
to
me
.
I
went
on
*NL*
foot
to
the
old
house
,
and
went
away
with
a
heart
too
full
to
enter
.
*NL*
I
returned
;
and
looking
,
as
I
passed
,
through
the
low
window
of
the
*NL*
turret-room
where
first
Uriah
Heep
,
and
afterwards
Mr.
Micawber
,
had
*NL*
been
wont
to
sit
,
saw
that
it
was
a
little
parlor
now
,
and
that
there
*NL*
was
no
office
.
Otherwise
the
staid
old
house
was
,
as
to
its
cleanliness
*NL*
and
order
,
still
just
as
it
had
been
when
I
first
saw
it
.
I
requested
*NL*
the
new
maid
who
admitted
me
,
to
tell
Miss
Wickfield
that
a
gentleman
*NL*
who
waited
on
her
from
a
friend
abroad
,
was
there
;
and
I
was
shown
*NL*
up
the
grave
old
staircase
-LRB-
cautioned
of
the
steps
I
knew
so
well
-RRB-
,
*NL*
into
the
unchanged
drawing-room
.
The
books
that
Agnes
and
I
had
read
*NL*
together
,
were
on
their
shelves
;
and
the
desk
where
I
had
labored
at
my
*NL*
lessons
,
many
a
night
,
stood
yet
at
the
same
old
corner
of
the
table
.
*NL*
All
the
little
changes
that
had
crept
in
when
the
Heeps
were
there
,
*NL*
were
changed
again
.
Everything
was
as
it
used
to
be
,
in
the
happy
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
in
a
window
,
and
looked
across
the
ancient
street
at
the
*NL*
opposite
houses
,
recalling
how
I
had
watched
them
on
wet
afternoons
,
*NL*
when
I
first
came
there
;
and
how
I
had
used
to
speculate
about
the
*NL*
people
who
appeared
at
any
of
the
windows
,
and
had
followed
them
with
my
*NL*
eyes
up
and
down
stairs
,
while
women
went
clicking
along
the
pavement
in
*NL*
pattens
,
and
the
dull
rain
fell
in
slanting
lines
,
and
poured
out
of
the
*NL*
waterspout
yonder
,
and
flowed
into
the
road
.
The
feeling
with
which
I
*NL*
used
to
watch
the
tramps
,
as
they
came
into
the
town
on
those
wet
*NL*
evenings
,
at
dusk
,
and
limped
past
,
with
their
bundles
drooping
over
*NL*
their
shoulders
at
the
ends
of
sticks
,
came
freshly
back
to
me
;
fraught
,
*NL*
as
then
,
with
the
smell
of
damp
earth
,
and
wet
leaves
and
briar
,
and
the
*NL*
sensation
of
the
very
airs
that
blew
upon
me
in
my
own
toilsome
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
opening
of
the
little
door
in
the
panneled
wall
made
me
start
and
*NL*
turn
.
Her
beautiful
serene
eyes
met
mine
as
she
came
towards
me
.
She
*NL*
stopped
and
laid
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
,
and
I
caught
her
in
my
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
!
my
dear
girl
!
I
have
come
too
suddenly
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
I
am
so
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
Trotwood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Agnes
,
the
happiness
it
is
to
me
,
to
see
you
once
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
folded
her
to
my
heart
,
and
,
for
a
little
while
,
we
were
both
silent
.
*NL*
Presently
we
sat
down
,
side
by
side
;
and
her
angel-face
was
turned
upon
*NL*
me
with
the
welcome
I
had
dreamed
of
,
waking
and
sleeping
,
for
whole
*NL*
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
true
,
she
was
so
beautiful
,
she
was
so
good
,
--
I
owed
her
so
*NL*
much
gratitude
,
she
was
so
dear
to
me
,
that
I
could
find
no
utterance
*NL*
for
what
I
felt
.
I
tried
to
bless
her
,
tried
to
thank
her
,
tried
to
tell
*NL*
her
-LRB-
as
I
had
often
done
in
letters
-RRB-
what
an
influence
she
had
upon
me
;
*NL*
but
all
my
efforts
were
in
vain
.
My
love
and
joy
were
dumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
own
sweet
tranquillity
,
she
calmed
my
agitation
;
led
me
back
to
*NL*
the
time
of
our
parting
;
spoke
to
me
of
Emily
,
whom
she
had
visited
,
in
*NL*
secret
,
many
times
;
spoke
to
me
tenderly
of
Dora
's
grave
.
With
the
*NL*
unerring
instinct
of
her
noble
heart
,
she
touched
the
chords
of
my
*NL*
memory
so
softly
and
harmoniously
,
that
not
one
jarred
within
me
;
I
*NL*
could
listen
to
the
sorrowful
,
distant
music
,
and
desire
to
shrink
from
*NL*
nothing
it
awoke
.
How
could
I
,
when
,
blended
with
it
all
,
was
her
dear
*NL*
self
,
the
better
angel
of
my
life
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Agnes
,
''
I
said
,
by
and
by
.
``
Tell
me
of
yourself
.
You
have
*NL*
hardly
ever
told
me
of
your
own
life
,
in
all
this
lapse
of
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
tell
?
''
she
answered
,
with
her
radiant
smile
.
``
Papa
is
*NL*
well
.
You
see
us
here
,
quiet
in
our
own
home
;
our
anxieties
set
at
rest
,
*NL*
our
home
restored
to
us
;
and
knowing
that
,
dear
Trotwood
,
you
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
,
Agnes
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
,
with
some
fluttering
wonder
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nothing
else
,
Sister
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
color
,
which
had
just
now
faded
,
returned
,
and
faded
again
.
She
*NL*
smiled
;
with
a
quiet
sadness
,
I
thought
;
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
sought
to
lead
her
to
what
my
aunt
had
hinted
at
;
for
,
sharply
*NL*
painful
to
me
as
it
must
be
to
receive
that
confidence
,
I
was
to
*NL*
discipline
my
heart
,
and
do
my
duty
to
her
.
I
saw
,
however
,
that
she
was
*NL*
uneasy
,
and
I
let
it
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
much
to
do
,
dear
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
my
school
?
''
said
she
,
looking
up
again
,
in
all
her
bright
*NL*
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
is
laborious
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
labor
is
so
pleasant
,
''
she
returned
,
``
that
it
is
scarcely
grateful
*NL*
in
me
to
call
it
by
that
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
good
is
difficult
to
you
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
color
came
and
went
once
more
;
and
once
more
,
as
she
bent
her
head
,
*NL*
I
saw
the
same
sad
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
wait
and
see
papa
,
''
said
Agnes
,
cheerfully
,
``
and
pass
the
day
*NL*
with
us
?
Perhaps
you
will
sleep
in
your
own
room
?
We
always
call
it
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
do
that
,
having
promised
to
ride
back
to
my
aunt
's
,
at
*NL*
night
;
but
I
would
pass
the
day
there
,
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
a
prisoner
for
a
little
while
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
but
here
are
the
*NL*
old
books
,
Trotwood
,
and
the
old
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
the
old
flowers
are
here
,
''
said
I
,
looking
round
;
``
or
the
old
*NL*
kinds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
a
pleasure
,
''
returned
Agnes
,
smiling
,
``
while
you
have
been
*NL*
absent
,
in
keeping
every
thing
as
it
used
to
be
when
we
were
children
.
*NL*
For
we
were
very
happy
then
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
knows
we
were
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
every
little
thing
that
has
reminded
me
of
my
brother
,
''
said
Agnes
,
*NL*
with
her
cordial
eyes
turned
cheerfully
upon
me
,
``
has
been
a
welcome
*NL*
companion
.
Even
this
,
''
showing
me
the
basket-trifle
,
full
of
keys
,
still
*NL*
hanging
at
her
side
,
``
seems
to
jingle
a
kind
of
old
tune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
again
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
by
which
she
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
for
me
to
guard
this
sisterly
affection
with
religious
care
.
It
*NL*
was
all
that
I
had
left
myself
,
and
it
was
a
treasure
.
If
I
once
shook
*NL*
the
foundations
of
the
sacred
confidence
and
usage
,
in
virtue
of
which
*NL*
it
was
given
to
me
,
it
was
lost
,
and
could
never
be
recovered
.
I
set
*NL*
this
steadily
before
myself
.
The
better
I
loved
her
,
the
more
it
behoved
*NL*
me
never
to
forget
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
through
the
streets
;
and
,
once
more
seeing
my
old
adversary
the
*NL*
butcher
--
now
a
constable
,
with
his
staff
hanging
up
in
the
shop
--
went
*NL*
down
to
look
at
the
place
where
I
had
fought
him
;
and
there
meditated
on
*NL*
Miss
Shepherd
and
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
,
and
all
the
idle
loves
and
*NL*
likings
,
and
dislikings
,
of
that
time
.
Nothing
seemed
to
have
survived
*NL*
that
time
but
Agnes
;
and
she
,
ever
a
star
above
me
,
was
brighter
and
*NL*
higher
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
returned
,
Mr.
Wickfield
had
come
home
,
from
a
garden
he
had
,
a
*NL*
couple
of
miles
or
so
out
of
the
town
,
where
he
now
employed
himself
*NL*
almost
every
day
.
I
found
him
as
my
aunt
had
described
him
.
We
sat
down
*NL*
to
dinner
,
with
some
half-dozen
little
girls
;
and
he
seemed
but
the
*NL*
shadow
of
his
handsome
picture
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tranquillity
and
peace
belonging
,
of
old
,
to
that
quiet
ground
in
my
*NL*
memory
,
pervaded
it
again
.
When
dinner
was
done
,
Mr.
Wickfield
taking
no
*NL*
wine
,
and
I
desiring
none
,
we
went
up
stairs
;
where
Agnes
and
her
little
*NL*
charges
sang
and
played
,
and
worked
.
After
tea
the
children
left
us
;
and
*NL*
we
three
sat
together
,
talking
of
the
by-gone
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
part
in
them
,
''
said
Mr.
Wickfield
,
shaking
his
white
head
,
``
has
much
*NL*
matter
for
regret
--
for
deep
regret
,
and
deep
contrition
,
Trotwood
,
you
*NL*
well
know
.
But
I
would
not
cancel
it
,
if
it
were
in
my
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
readily
believe
that
,
looking
at
the
face
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
cancel
with
it
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
such
patience
and
devotion
,
such
*NL*
fidelity
,
such
a
child
's
love
,
as
I
must
not
forget
,
no
!
even
to
forget
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
,
sir
,
''
I
softly
said
.
``
I
hold
it
--
I
have
always
held
*NL*
it
--
in
veneration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
one
knows
,
not
even
you
,
''
he
returned
,
``
how
much
she
has
done
,
*NL*
how
much
she
has
undergone
,
how
hard
she
has
striven
.
Dear
Agnes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
put
her
hand
entreatingly
on
his
arm
,
to
stop
him
;
and
was
very
,
*NL*
very
,
pale

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
dismissing
,
as
I
then
saw
,
some
trial
*NL*
she
had
borne
,
or
was
yet
to
bear
,
in
connexion
with
what
my
aunt
had
*NL*
told
me
.
``
Well
!
I
have
never
told
you
,
Trotwood
,
of
her
mother
.
Has
any
*NL*
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
much
--
though
it
was
much
to
suffer
.
She
married
me
in
*NL*
opposition
to
her
father
's
wish
,
and
he
renounced
her
.
She
prayed
him
to
*NL*
forgive
her
,
before
my
Agnes
came
into
this
world
.
He
was
a
very
hard
*NL*
man
,
and
her
mother
had
long
been
dead
.
He
repulsed
her
.
He
broke
her
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
leaned
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
stole
her
arm
about
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
an
affectionate
and
gentle
heart
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
it
was
broken
.
*NL*
I
knew
its
tender
nature
very
well
.
No
one
could
,
if
I
did
not
.
She
*NL*
loved
me
dearly
,
but
was
never
happy
.
She
was
always
laboring
,
in
*NL*
secret
,
under
this
distress
;
and
being
delicate
and
downcast
at
the
time
*NL*
of
his
last
repulse
--
for
it
was
not
the
first
,
by
many
--
pined
away
and
*NL*
died
.
She
left
me
Agnes
,
two
weeks
old
;
and
the
grey
hair
that
you
*NL*
recollect
me
with
,
when
you
first
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
Agnes
on
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
for
my
dear
child
was
a
diseased
love
,
but
my
mind
was
all
*NL*
unhealthy
then
.
I
say
no
more
of
that
.
I
am
not
speaking
of
myself
,
*NL*
Trotwood
,
but
of
her
mother
,
and
of
her
.
If
I
give
you
any
clue
to
what
*NL*
I
am
,
or
to
what
I
have
been
,
you
will
unravel
it
,
I
know
.
What
Agnes
*NL*
is
,
I
need
not
say
.
I
have
always
read
something
of
her
poor
mother
's
*NL*
story
,
in
her
character
;
and
so
I
tell
it
you
to-night
,
when
we
three
*NL*
are
again
together
,
after
such
great
changes
.
I
have
told
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
bowed
head
,
and
her
angel
face
and
filial
duty
,
derived
a
more
*NL*
pathetic
meaning
from
it
than
they
had
had
before
.
If
I
had
wanted
*NL*
anything
by
which
to
mark
this
night
of
our
reunion
,
I
should
have
found
*NL*
it
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agnes
rose
up
from
her
father
's
side
,
before
long
;
and
going
softly
to
*NL*
her
piano
,
played
some
of
the
old
airs
to
which
we
had
often
listened
in
*NL*
that
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
intention
of
going
away
again
?
''
Agnes
asked
me
,
as
I
was
*NL*
standing
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
my
sister
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
have
no
such
intention

Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
ought
not
,
Trotwood
,
since
you
ask
me
,
''
she
said
,
mildly
.
*NL*
``
Your
growing
reputation
and
success
enlarge
your
power
of
doing
good
;
*NL*
and
if

I

could
spare
my
brother

with
her
eyes
upon
me
,
``
perhaps
the

not

*NL*
``

made
me

You
should
know
best

_
I

made
you

Trotwood

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
Agnes
,
my
dear
girl
!

I
said
,
bending
over
her
.
``
I
tried
to
*NL*
tell
you
,
when
we
met
to-day
,
something
that
has
been
in
my
thoughts
*NL*
since
Dora
died
.
You
remember
,
when
you
came
down
to
me
in
our
little
*NL*
room
--
pointing
upward
,
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Trotwood
!
''
she
returned
,
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
``
So
loving

so
*NL*
confiding
,

so
young

Can
I
ever
forget

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
were
then
,
my
sister

I
have
often
thought
since

you
have
ever
*NL*
been
to
me
.
Ever
pointing
upward
,
Agnes
;
ever
leading
me
to
something
*NL*
better
;
ever
directing
me
to
higher
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
shook
her
head
;
through
her
tears
I
saw
the
same
sad
quiet
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
so
grateful
to
you
for
it
,
Agnes
,
so
bound
to
you
,
that
there
*NL*
is
no
name
for
the
affection
of
my
heart
.
I
want
you
to
know
,
yet
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
tell
you
,
that
all
my
life
long
I
shall
look
up
to
you
,
and
*NL*
be
guided
by
you
,
as
I
have
been
through
the
darkness
that
is
past

*NL*
Whatever
betides
,
whatever
new
ties
you
may
form
,
whatever
changes
may
*NL*
come
between
us

I
shall
always
look
to
you

and
love
you
,
as
I
do
now
,
*NL*
and
have
always
done

You
will
always
be
my
solace

as
you
*NL*
have
always
been

Until
I
die

my
dearest

I
shall
see
you
always

upward

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
told
me
she
was
proud
of
me
,
and
of
what
I
*NL*
said
;
although
I
praised
her
very
far
beyond
her
worth
.
Then
,
she
went
*NL*
on
softly
playing
,
but
without
removing
her
eyes
from
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
what
I
have
heard
to-night
,
Agnes
,
''
said
I
,
``
strangely
*NL*
seems
to
be
a
part
of
the
feeling
with
which
I
regarded
you
when
I
saw
*NL*
you
first
--
with
which
I
sat
beside
you
in
my
rough
school-days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
I
had
no
mother
,
''
she
replied
with
a
smile
,
``
and
felt
kindly
*NL*
towards
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
that
,
Agnes
.
I
knew
,
almost
as
if
I
had
known
this
story
,
*NL*
that
there
was
something
inexplicably
gentle
and
softened
,
surrounding
*NL*
you
;
something
that
might
have
been
sorrowful
in
some
one
else
-LRB-
as
I
can
*NL*
now
understand
it
was
-RRB-
,
but
was
not
so
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
softly
played
on
,
looking
at
me
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
laugh
at
my
cherishing
such
fancies
,
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
at
my
saying
that
I
really
believe
I
felt
,
even
then
,
that
you
could
*NL*
be
faithfully
affectionate
against
all
discouragement
,
and
never
cease
*NL*
to
be
so
,
until
you
ceased
to
live
?

Will
you
laugh
at
such
a
dream
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
Oh
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
,
a
distressful
shadow
crossed
her
face
;
but
,
even
in
the
*NL*
start
it
gave
me
,
it
was
gone
;
and
she
was
playing
on
,
and
looking
at
me
*NL*
with
her
own
calm
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
rode
back
in
the
lonely
night
,
the
wind
going
by
me
like
a
restless
*NL*
memory
,
I
thought
of
this
,
and
feared
she
was
not
happy
.
_
I
_
was
not
*NL*
happy
;
but
,
thus
far
,
I
had
faithfully
set
the
seal
upon
the
Past
,
and
,
*NL*
thinking
of
her
,
pointing
upward
,
thought
of
her
as
pointing
to
that
sky
*NL*
above
me
,
where
,
in
the
mystery
to
come
,
I
might
yet
love
her
with
a
*NL*
love
unknown
on
earth
,
and
tell
her
what
the
strife
had
been
within
me
*NL*
when
I
loved
her
here

CHAPTER
LXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
AM
SHOWN
TWO
INTERESTING
PENITENTS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
--
at
all
events
until
my
book
should
be
completed
,
which
would
*NL*
be
the
work
of
several
months
--
I
took
up
my
abode
in
my
aunt
's
house
at
*NL*
Dover
;
and
there
,
sitting
in
the
window
from
which
I
had
looked
out
at
*NL*
the
moon
upon
the
sea
,
when
that
roof
first
gave
me
shelter
,
I
quietly
*NL*
pursued
my
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
my
intention
of
referring
to
my
own
fictions
only
when
*NL*
their
course
should
incidentally
connect
itself
with
the
progress
of
my
*NL*
story
,
I
do
not
enter
on
the
aspirations
,
the
delights
,
anxieties
,
and
*NL*
triumphs
,
of
my
art
.
That
I
truly
devoted
myself
to
it
with
my
strongest
*NL*
earnestness
,
and
bestowed
upon
it
every
energy
of
my
soul
,
I
have
*NL*
already
said
.
If
the
books
I
have
written
be
of
any
worth
,
they
will
*NL*
supply
the
rest
.
I
shall
otherwise
have
written
to
poor
purpose
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
will
be
of
interest
to
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
,
I
went
to
London
;
to
lose
myself
in
the
swarm
of
life
*NL*
there
,
or
to
consult
with
Traddles
on
some
business
point
.
He
had
*NL*
managed
for
me
,
in
my
absence
,
with
the
soundest
judgment
;
and
my
*NL*
worldly
affairs
were
prospering
.
As
my
notoriety
began
to
bring
upon
*NL*
me
an
enormous
quantity
of
letters
from
people
of
whom
I
had
no
*NL*
knowledge
--
chiefly
about
nothing
,
and
extremely
difficult
to
answer
--
I
*NL*
agreed
with
Traddles
to
have
my
name
painted
up
on
his
door
.
There
,
*NL*
the
devoted
postmen
on
that
beat
delivered
bushels
of
letters
for
me
;
*NL*
and
there
,
at
intervals
,
I
labored
through
them
,
like
a
Home
Secretary
*NL*
of
State
without
the
salary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
this
correspondence
,
there
dropped
in
,
every
now
and
then
,
an
*NL*
obliging
proposal
from
one
of
the
numerous
outsiders
always
lurking
*NL*
about
the
Commons
,
to
practise
under
cover
of
my
name
-LRB-
if
I
would
take
*NL*
the
necessary
steps
remaining
to
make
a
proctor
of
myself
-RRB-
,
and
pay
me
a
*NL*
percentage
on
the
profits
.
But
I
declined
these
offers
;
being
already
*NL*
aware
that
there
were
plenty
of
such
covert
practitioners
in
existence
,
*NL*
and
considering
the
Commons
quite
bad
enough
,
without
my
doing
anything
*NL*
to
make
it
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
had
gone
home
,
when
my
name
burst
into
bloom
on
Traddles
's
*NL*
door
;
and
the
sharp
boy
looked
,
all
day
,
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
*NL*
Sophy
,
shut
up
in
a
back
room
,
glancing
down
from
her
work
into
a
sooty
*NL*
little
strip
of
garden
with
a
pump
in
it
.
But
,
there
I
always
found
her
,
*NL*
the
same
bright
housewife
;
often
humming
her
Devonshire
ballads
when
no
*NL*
strange
foot
was
coming
up
the
stairs
,
and
blunting
the
sharp
boy
in
his
*NL*
official
closet
with
melody
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
,
at
first
,
why
I
so
often
found
Sophy
writing
in
a
copy-book
;
*NL*
and
why
she
always
shut
it
up
when
I
appeared
,
and
hurried
it
into
the
*NL*
table-drawer
.
But
the
secret
soon
came
out
.
One
day
,
Traddles
-LRB-
who
had
*NL*
just
come
home
through
the
drizzling
sleet
from
Court
-RRB-
took
a
paper
out
*NL*
of
his
desk
,
and
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
that
handwriting
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
do
n't
_
,
Tom
!
''
cried
Sophy
,
who
was
warming
his
slippers
before
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
returned
Tom
,
in
a
delighted
state
,
``
why
not
?
What
do
you
say
*NL*
to
that
writing
,
Copperfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
extraordinarily
legal
and
formal
,
''
said
I.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
*NL*
saw
such
a
stiff
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
like
a
lady
's
hand
,
is
it
?
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lady
's
!
''
I
repeated
.
``
Bricks
and
mortar
are
more
like
a
lady
's
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
broke
into
a
rapturous
laugh
,
and
informed
me
that
it
was
*NL*
Sophy
's
writing
;
that
Sophy
had
vowed
and
declared
he
would
need
a
*NL*
copying-clerk
soon
,
and
she
would
be
that
clerk
;
that
she
had
acquired
*NL*
this
hand
from
a
pattern
;
and
that
she
could
throw
off
--
I
forget
how
*NL*
many
folios
an
hour
.
Sophy
was
very
much
confused
by
my
being
told
all
*NL*
this
,
and
said
that
when
``
Tom
''
was
made
a
judge
he
would
n't
be
so
ready
*NL*
to
proclaim
it
.
Which
``
Tom
''
denied
;
averring
that
he
should
always
be
*NL*
equally
proud
of
it
,
under
all
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
thoroughly
good
and
charming
wife
she
is
,
my
dear
Traddles
!
''
*NL*
said
I
,
when
she
had
gone
away
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Copperfield
,
''
returned
Traddles
,
``
she
is
,
without
any
*NL*
exception
,
the
dearest
girl
!
The
way
she
manages
this
place
;
her
*NL*
punctuality
,
domestic
knowledge
,
economy
,
and
order
;
her
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
you
have
reason
to
commend
her
!
''
I
returned
.
``
You
are
a
happy
*NL*
fellow
.
I
believe
you
make
yourselves
,
and
each
other
,
two
of
the
*NL*
happiest
people
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
we
_
are
_
two
of
the
happiest
people
,
''
returned
Traddles
.
``
I
*NL*
admit
that
,
at
all
events
.
Bless
my
soul
,
when
I
see
her
getting
up
by
*NL*
candle-light
on
these
dark
mornings
,
busying
herself
in
the
day
's
*NL*
arrangements
,
going
out
to
market
before
the
clerks
come
into
the
Inn
,
*NL*
caring
for
no
weather

devising
the
most
capital
little
dinners
out
of
*NL*
the
plainest
materials
,
making
puddings
and
pies
,
keeping
everything
in
*NL*
its
right
place
,
always
so
neat
and
ornamental
herself
,
sitting
up
at
*NL*
night
with
me
if
it
's
ever
so
late
,
sweet-tempered
and
encouraging
*NL*
always
,
and
all
for
me
,
I
positively
sometimes
ca
n't
believe
it
,
*NL*
Copperfield
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
tender
of
the
very
slippers
she
had
been
warming
,
as
he
put
them
*NL*
on
,
and
stretched
his
feet
enjoyingly
upon
the
fender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
positively
sometimes
ca
n't
believe
it
,
''
said
Traddles
.
``
Then
,
our
*NL*
pleasures
!
Dear
me
,
they
are
inexpensive
,
but
they
are
quite
wonderful
!
*NL*
When
we
are
at
home
here
,
of
an
evening
,
and
shut
the
outer
door
,
and
*NL*
draw
those
curtains
--
which
she
made
--
where
could
we
be
more
snug
?
*NL*
When
it
's
fine
,
and
we
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the
evening
,
the
streets
*NL*
abound
in
enjoyment
for
us
.
We
look
into
the
glittering
windows
of
the
*NL*
jewellers
'
shops
;
and
I
show
Sophy
which
of
the
diamond-eyed
serpents
,
*NL*
coiled
up
on
white
satin
rising
grounds
,
I
would
give
her
if
I
could
*NL*
afford
it
;
and
Sophy
shows
me
which
of
the
gold
watches
that
are
*NL*
capped
and
jewelled
and
engine-turned
,
and
possessed
of
the
horizontal
*NL*
lever-escape-movement
,
and
all
sorts
of
things
,
she
would
buy
for
*NL*
me
if
_
she
_
could
afford
it
;
and
we
pick
out
the
spoons
and
forks
,
*NL*
fish-slices
,
butter-knives
,
and
sugar-tongs
,
we
should
both
prefer
if
*NL*
we
could
both
afford
it
;
and
really
we
go
away
as
if
we
had
got
them
!
*NL*
Then
,
when
we
stroll
into
the
squares
,
and
great
streets
,
and
see
a
*NL*
house
to
let
,
sometimes
we
look
up
at
it
,
and
say
,
how
would
_
that
_
do
,
*NL*
if
I
was
made
a
judge
?
And
we
parcel
it
out
--
such
a
room
for
us
,
such
*NL*
rooms
for
the
girls
,
and
so
forth
;
until
we
settle
to
our
satisfaction
*NL*
that
it
would
do
,
or
it
would
n't
do
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
Sometimes
,
we
*NL*
go
at
half-price
to
the
pit
of
the
theatre
--
the
very
smell
of
which
is
*NL*
cheap
,
in
my
opinion
,
at
the
money
--
and
there
we
thoroughly
enjoy
the
*NL*
play
:
which
Sophy
believes
every
word
of
,
and
so
do
I
.
In
walking
home
,
*NL*
perhaps
we
buy
a
little
bit
of
something
at
a
cook
's
-
shop
,
or
a
little
*NL*
lobster
at
the
fishmonger
's
,
and
bring
it
here
,
and
make
a
splendid
*NL*
supper
,
chatting
about
what
we
have
seen
.
Now
,
you
know
,
Copperfield
,
*NL*
if
I
was
Lord
Chancellor
,
we
could
n't
do
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
do
something
,
whatever
you
were
,
my
dear
Traddles
,
''
thought
*NL*
I
,
``
that
would
be
pleasant
and
amiable
!
And
by
the
way
,
''
I
said
aloud
,
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
never
draw
any
skeletons
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
replied
Traddles
,
laughing
,
and
reddening
,
``
I
ca
n't
wholly
*NL*
deny
that
I
do
,
my
dear
Copperfield
.
For
,
being
in
one
of
the
back
rows
*NL*
of
the
King
's
Bench
the
other
day
,
with
a
pen
in
my
hand
,
the
fancy
came
*NL*
into
my
head
to
try
how
I
had
preserved
that
accomplishment
.
And
I
am
*NL*
afraid
there
's
a
skeleton
--
in
a
wig
--
on
the
ledge
of
the
desk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
both
laughed
heartily
,
Traddles
wound
up
by
looking
with
a
*NL*
smile
at
the
fire
,
and
saying
,
in
his
forgiving
way
,
``
Old
Creakle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
letter
from
that
old
--
Rascal
here
,
''
said
I.
For
I
never
was
*NL*
less
disposed
to
forgive
him
the
way
he
used
to
batter
Traddles
,
than
*NL*
when
I
saw
Traddles
so
ready
to
forgive
him
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Creakle
the
schoolmaster
?
''
exclaimed
Traddles
.
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among
the
persons
who
are
attracted
to
me
in
my
rising
fame
and
*NL*
fortune
,
''
said
I
,
looking
over
my
letters
,
``
and
who
discover
that
they
*NL*
were
always
much
attached
to
me
,
is
the
self-same
Creakle
.
He
is
not
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
now
,
Traddles
.
He
is
retired
.
He
is
a
Middlesex
*NL*
Magistrate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Traddles
might
be
surprised
to
hear
it
,
but
he
was
not
so
at
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
suppose
he
comes
to
be
a
Middlesex
Magistrate
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
me
!
''
replied
Traddles
,
``
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
answer
*NL*
that
question
.
Perhaps
he
voted
for
somebody
,
or
lent
money
to
somebody
,
*NL*
or
bought
something
of
somebody
,
or
otherwise
obliged
somebody
,
or
*NL*
jobbed
for
somebody
,
who
knew
somebody
who
got
the
lieutenant
of
the
*NL*
county
to
nominate
him
for
the
commission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
commission
he
is
,
at
any
rate
,
''
said
I.
``
And
he
writes
to
me
*NL*
here
,
that
he
will
be
glad
to
show
me
,
in
operation
,
the
only
true
*NL*
system
of
prison
discipline
;
the
only
unchallengeable
way
of
making
*NL*
sincere
and
lasting
converts
and
penitents
--
which
,
you
know
,
is
by
*NL*
solitary
confinement
.
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
system
?
''
inquired
Traddles
,
looking
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
To
my
accepting
the
offer
,
and
your
going
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
object
,
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
write
to
say
so
.
You
remember
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
our
*NL*
treatment
-RRB-
this
same
Creakle
turning
his
son
out
of
doors
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
and
the
life
he
used
to
lead
his
wife
and
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
,
''
said
Traddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
if
you
'll
read
his
letter
,
you
'll
find
he
is
the
tenderest
of
men
*NL*
to
prisoners
convicted
of
the
whole
calendar
of
felonies
,
''
said
I
;
*NL*
``
though
I
ca
n't
find
that
his
tenderness
extends
to
any
other
class
of
*NL*
created
beings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
.
I
had
not
*NL*
expected
him
to
be
,
and
was
not
surprised
myself
;
or
my
observation
of
*NL*
similar
practical
satires
would
have
been
but
scanty
.
We
arranged
the
*NL*
time
of
our
visit
,
and
I
wrote
accordingly
to
Mr.
Creakle
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
appointed
day
--
I
think
it
was
the
next
day
,
but
no
*NL*
matter
--
Traddles
and
I
repaired
to
the
prison
where
Mr.
Creakle
was
*NL*
powerful
.
It
was
an
immense
and
solid
building
,
erected
at
a
vast
*NL*
expense
.
I
could
not
help
thinking
,
as
we
approached
the
gate
,
what
*NL*
an
uproar
would
have
been
made
in
the
country
,
if
any
deluded
man
had
*NL*
proposed
to
spend
one
half
the
money
it
had
cost
,
on
the
erection
of
an
*NL*
industrial
school
for
the
young
,
or
a
house
of
refuge
for
the
deserving
*NL*
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
office
that
might
have
been
on
the
ground-floor
of
the
Tower
of
*NL*
Babel
,
it
was
so
massively
constructed
,
we
were
presented
to
our
old
*NL*
schoolmaster
;
who
was
one
of
a
group
,
composed
of
two
or
three
of
the
*NL*
busier
sort
of
magistrates
,
and
some
visitors
they
had
brought
.
He
*NL*
received
me
,
like
a
man
who
had
formed
my
mind
in
bygone
years
,
and
had
*NL*
always
loved
me
tenderly
.
On
my
introducing
Traddles
,
Mr.
Creakle
*NL*
expressed
,
in
like
manner
,
but
in
an
inferior
degree
,
that
he
had
always
*NL*
been
Traddles
's
guide
,
philosopher
,
and
friend
.
Our
venerable
instructor
*NL*
was
a
great
deal
older
,
and
not
improved
in
appearance
.
His
face
was
as
*NL*
fiery
as
ever
;
his
eyes
were
as
small
,
and
rather
deeper
set
.
The
*NL*
scanty
,
wet-looking
grey
hair
,
by
which
I
remembered
him
,
was
almost
*NL*
gone
;
and
the
thick
veins
in
his
bald
head
were
none
the
more
agreeable
*NL*
to
look
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
conversation
among
these
gentlemen
,
from
which
I
might
have
*NL*
supposed
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
legitimately
taken
*NL*
into
account
but
the
supreme
comfort
of
prisoners
,
at
any
expense
,
and
*NL*
nothing
on
the
wide
earth
to
be
done
outside
prison-doors
,
we
began
our
*NL*
inspection
.
It
being
then
just
dinner-time
,
we
went
,
first
into
the
*NL*
great
kitchen
,
where
every
prisoner
's
dinner
was
in
course
of
being
set
*NL*
out
separately
-LRB-
to
be
handed
to
him
in
his
cell
-RRB-
,
with
the
regularity
*NL*
and
precision
of
clock-work
.
I
said
aside
,
to
Traddles
,
that
I
wondered
*NL*
whether
it
occurred
to
anybody
,
that
there
was
a
striking
contrast
*NL*
between
these
plentiful
repasts
of
choice
quality
,
and
the
dinners
,
not
*NL*
to
say
of
paupers
,
but
of
soldiers
,
sailors
,
laborers
,
the
great
bulk
of
*NL*
the
honest
,
working
community
;
of
whom
not
one
man
in
five
hundred
ever
*NL*
dined
half
so
well
.
But
I
learned
that
the
``
system
''
required
high
*NL*
living
;
and
,
in
short
,
to
dispose
of
the
system
,
once
for
all
,
I
found
*NL*
that
on
that
head
and
on
all
others
,
``
the
system
''
put
an
end
to
all
*NL*
doubts
,
and
disposed
of
all
anomalies
.
Nobody
appeared
to
have
the
least
*NL*
idea
that
there
was
any
other
system
,
but
_
the
_
system
,
to
be
*NL*
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
going
through
some
of
the
magnificent
passages
,
I
inquired
of
*NL*
Mr.
Creakle
and
his
friends
what
were
supposed
to
be
the
main
advantages
*NL*
of
this
all-governing
and
universally
over-riding
system
?
I
found
them
*NL*
to
be
the
perfect
isolation
of
prisoners
--
so
that
no
one
man
in
*NL*
confinement
there
,
knew
anything
about
another
;
and
the
reduction
of
*NL*
prisoners
to
a
wholesome
state
of
mind
,
leading
to
sincere
contrition
*NL*
and
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
struck
me
,
when
we
began
to
visit
individuals
in
their
cells
,
*NL*
and
to
traverse
the
passages
in
which
those
cells
were
,
and
to
have
the
*NL*
manner
of
the
going
to
chapel
and
so
forth
,
explained
to
us
,
that
there
*NL*
was
a
strong
probability
of
the
prisoners
knowing
a
good
deal
about
each
*NL*
other
,
and
of
their
carrying
on
a
pretty
complete
system
of
intercourse
.
*NL*
This
,
at
the
time
I
write
,
has
been
proved
,
I
believe
,
to
be
the
case
;
*NL*
but
,
as
it
would
have
been
flat
blasphemy
against
the
system
to
have
*NL*
hinted
such
a
doubt
then
,
I
looked
out
for
the
penitence
as
diligently
*NL*
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
again
,
I
had
great
misgivings
.
I
found
as
prevalent
a
fashion
*NL*
in
the
form
of
the
penitence
,
as
I
had
left
outside
in
the
forms
of
the
*NL*
coats
and
waistcoats
in
the
windows
of
the
tailors
'
shops
.
I
found
a
*NL*
vast
amount
of
profession
,
varying
very
little
in
character
:
varying
*NL*
very
little
-LRB-
which
I
thought
exceedingly
suspicious
-RRB-
,
even
in
words
.
I
*NL*
found
a
great
many
foxes
,
disparaging
whole
vineyards
of
inaccessible
*NL*
grapes
;
but
I
found
very
few
foxes
whom
I
would
have
trusted
within
*NL*
reach
of
a
bunch
.
Above
all
,
I
found
that
the
most
professing
men
were
*NL*
the
greatest
objects
of
interest
;
and
that
their
conceit
,
their
vanity
,
*NL*
their
want
of
excitement
,
and
their
love
of
deception
-LRB-
which
many
of
*NL*
them
possessed
to
an
almost
incredible
extent
,
as
their
histories
*NL*
showed
-RRB-
,
all
prompted
to
these
professions
,
and
were
all
gratified
by
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
heard
so
repeatedly
,
in
the
course
of
our
goings
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
of
a
certain
Number
Twenty
Seven
,
who
was
the
Favorite
,
and
who
really
*NL*
appeared
to
be
a
Model
Prisoner
,
that
I
resolved
to
suspend
my
judgment
*NL*
until
I
should
see
Twenty
Seven
.
Twenty
Eight
,
I
understood
,
was
also
a
*NL*
bright
particular
star
;
but
it
was
his
misfortune
to
have
his
glory
a
*NL*
little
dimmed
by
the
extraordinary
lustre
of
Twenty
Seven
.
I
heard
so
*NL*
much
of
Twenty
Seven
,
of
his
pious
admonitions
to
everybody
around
him
,
*NL*
and
of
the
beautiful
letters
he
constantly
wrote
to
his
mother
-LRB-
whom
he
*NL*
seemed
to
consider
in
a
very
bad
way
-RRB-
,
that
I
became
quite
impatient
to
*NL*
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
restrain
my
impatience
for
some
time
,
on
account
of
Twenty
*NL*
Seven
being
reserved
for
a
concluding
effect
.
But
,
at
last
,
we
came
to
*NL*
the
door
of
his
cell
;
and
Mr.
Creakle
,
looking
through
a
little
hole
in
*NL*
it
,
reported
to
us
,
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
admiration
,
that
he
was
*NL*
reading
a
Hymn
Book
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
a
rush
of
heads
immediately
,
to
see
Number
Twenty
Seven
*NL*
reading
his
Hymn
Book
,
that
the
little
hole
was
blocked
up
,
six
or
seven
*NL*
heads
deep
.
To
remedy
this
inconvenience
,
and
give
us
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
conversing
with
Twenty
Seven
in
all
his
purity
,
Mr.
Creakle
directed
the
*NL*
door
of
the
cell
to
be
unlocked
,
and
Twenty
Seven
to
be
invited
out
into
*NL*
the
passage
.
This
was
done
;
and
whom
should
Traddles
and
I
then
behold
,
*NL*
to
our
amazement
,
in
this
converted
Number
Twenty
Seven
,
but
Uriah
Heep
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
us
directly
;
and
said
,
as
he
came
out
--
with
the
old
writhe
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Copperfield
?
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Traddles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
recognition
caused
a
general
admiration
in
the
party
.
I
rather
*NL*
thought
that
everyone
was
struck
by
his
not
being
proud
,
and
taking
*NL*
notice
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Twenty
Seven
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
,
mournfully
admiring
him
.
``
How
do
*NL*
you
find
yourself
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
umble
,
sir
!
''
replied
Uriah
Heep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
so
,
Twenty
Seven
,
''
said
Mr.
Creakle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
another
gentleman
asked
,
with
extreme
anxiety
:
``
Are
you
quite
*NL*
comfortable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
thank
you
,
sir
!
''
said
Uriah
Heep
,
looking
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
``
Far
more
comfortable
here
,
than
ever
I
was
outside
.
I
see
my
follies
*NL*
now
,
sir
.
That
's
what
makes
me
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
gentlemen
were
much
affected
;
and
a
third
questioner
,
forcing
*NL*
himself
to
the
front
,
inquired
with
extreme
feeling
:
``
How
do
you
find
*NL*
the
beef
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
replied
Uriah
,
glancing
in
the
new
direction
of
this
*NL*
voice
,
``
it
was
tougher
yesterday
than
I
could
wish
;
but
it
's
my
duty
to
*NL*
bear
.
I
have
committed
follies

''
said
Uriah
,
looking
round
*NL*
with
a
meek
smile
,
``
and
I
ought
to
bear
the
consequences
without
*NL*
repining

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
,
partly
of
gratification
at
Twenty
Seven
's
celestial
state
of
*NL*
mind
,
and
partly
of
indignation
against
the
Contractor
who
had
given
him
*NL*
any
cause
of
complaint
-LRB-
a
note
of
which
was
immediately
made
by
Mr.
*NL*
Creakle
-RRB-
,
having
subsided
,
Twenty
Seven
stood
in
the
midst
of
us
,
as
if
*NL*
he
felt
himself
the
principal
object
of
merit
in
a
highly
meritorious
*NL*
museum
.
That
we
,
the
neophytes
,
might
have
an
excess
of
light
shining
*NL*
upon
us
all
at
once
,
orders
were
given
to
let
out
Twenty
Eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
so
much
astonished
already
,
that
I
only
felt
a
kind
of
*NL*
resigned
wonder
when
Mr.
Littimer
walked
forth
,
reading
a
good
book
!

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
a
gentleman
in
spectacles
,
who
had
not
yet
spoken

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

I

aware

that
there
is

great
adulteration

in

that

difficult

*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
me
that
the
gentleman
in
spectacles
backed
his
Twenty
*NL*
Eight
against
Mr.
Creakle
's
Twenty
Seven
,
for
each
of
them
took
his
own

man
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the
questioner
in

*NL*
``

returned
Mr.

;
``

Mr.

without
looking
up
,
``

not

deceived

there
is
a

my
former

It
may
be
profitable
to
that

to
know

*NL*
that
I
attribute
my
past

entirely
to
having
lived

allowed

*NL*
*NL*
I
observed

several

were
shading
their

had
just
come
into

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Mr.

slightly
lifting
up
his
eyebrows

not
*NL*
his

,
``

no

*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
Number
Twenty
Eight
retired
,
after
a
glance
between
him
and
*NL*
Uriah
;
as
if
they
were
not
altogether
unknown
to
each
other
,
through
*NL*
some
medium
of
communication
;
and
a
murmur
went
round
the
group
,
as
his
*NL*
door
shut
upon
him
,
that
he
was
a
most
respectable
man
,
and
a
beautiful
*NL*
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Mr.
Creakle
,
entering
on
a
clear
stage
with
*NL*
_
his

man
,
``
is
there
anything
that
any

can
do
for

so

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Uriah

with
a
jerk
of
his
malevolent
*NL*
head
,
``

leave
to
write
again
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
certainly
be

Mr.

*NL*
``

anxious
about

I
am
afraid

''
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
incautiously
asked
,
what
from
?
But
there
was
a
scandalised
*NL*
whisper
of
``
Hush
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immortally
safe
,

returned
Uriah
,
writhing
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
voice

``
I
should

This

gave
unbounded
satisfaction

greater
satisfaction

think

than
anything
that
had
passed
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Before

stealing
a
look
at

would

have
blighted
the

could

Several
indignant
glances
directed
at

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
forgive

said
Uriah
,
making
his
forgiving
*NL*
nature
the
subject
of
a
most
impious
and
awful
parallel
,
which
I
shall
*NL*
not
record

I
forgive

He
sneaked
back
into
his
cell
,
amidst
a
little
chorus
of
approbation
;
*NL*
and
both
Traddles
and
I
experienced
a
great
relief
when
he
was
locked
*NL*
in

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
characteristic
feature
in
this
repentance

that
I
was
fain
to
*NL*
ask
what
these
two
men
had
done
,
to
be
there
at
all

That
appeared
to
be
*NL*
the
last
thing
about
which
they
had
anything
to
say

I
addressed
myself
*NL*
to
one
of
the
two
warders
,
who
,
I
suspected
,
from
certain
latent
*NL*
indications
in
their
faces

knew
pretty
well
what
all
this
stir
was
*NL*
worth

*NL*
*NL*
``

said

The

grim
*NL*
Death

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
Miss
Mowcher
!
''
cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
have
said
so
,
if
you
had
seen
her
,
standing
on
a
chair
in
the
*NL*
witness-box
at
his
trial
,
as
I
did
,
''
said
my
friend
.
``
He
cut
her
face
*NL*
right
open
,
and
pounded
her
in
the
most
brutal
manner
,
when
she
took
*NL*
him
;
but
she
never
loosed
her
hold
till
he
was
locked
up
.
She
held
so
*NL*
tight
to
him
,
in
fact
,
that
the
officers
were
obliged
to
take
'em
both
*NL*
together
.
She
gave
her
evidence
in
the
gamest
way
,
and
was
highly
*NL*
complimented
by
the
Bench
,
and
cheered
right
home
to
her
lodgings
.
She
*NL*
said
in
Court
that
she
'd
have
took
him
single-handed
-LRB-
on
account
of
what
*NL*
she
knew
concerning
him
-RRB-
,
if
he
had
been
Samson

And
it
's
my
belief

*NL*
would

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
mine
too
,
and
I
highly
respected
Miss
Mowcher
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
now
seen
all
there
was
to
see
.
It
would
have
been
in
vain
to
*NL*
represent
to
such
a
man
as
the
Worshipful
Mr.
Creakle
,
that
Twenty
Seven
*NL*
and
Twenty
Eight
were
perfectly
consistent
and
unchanged
;
that
exactly
*NL*
what
they
were
then
,
they
had
always
been
;
that
the
hypocritical
knaves
*NL*
were
just
the
subjects
to
make
that
sort
of
profession
in
such
a
place
;
*NL*
that
they
knew
its
market-value
at
least
as
well
as
we
did
,
in
the
*NL*
immediate
service
it
would
do
them
when
they
were
expatriated
;
in
a
*NL*
word
,
that
it
was
a
rotten
,
hollow
,
painfully-suggestive
piece
of
*NL*
business
altogether
.
We
left
them
to
their
system
and
themselves
,

*NL*
went
home
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it

CHAPTER
LXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
LIGHT
SHINES
ON
MY
WAY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
year
came
round
to
Christmas-time
,
and
I
had
been
at
home
above
two
*NL*
months
.
I
had
seen
Agnes
frequently
.
However
loud
the
general
voice
*NL*
might
be
in
giving
me
encouragement
,
and
however
fervent
the
emotions
*NL*
and
endeavours
to
which
it
roused
me
,
I
heard
her
lightest
word
of
*NL*
praise
as
I
heard
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
once
a
week
,
and
sometimes
oftener
,
I
rode
over
there
,
and
*NL*
passed
the
evening
.
I
usually
rode
back
at
night
;
for
the
old
unhappy
*NL*
sense
was
always
hovering
about
me
now
--
most
sorrowfully
when
I
left
*NL*
her
--
and
I
was
glad
to
be
up
and
out
,
rather
than
wandering
over
the
*NL*
past
in
weary
wakefulness
or
miserable
dreams
.
I
wore
away
the
longest
*NL*
part
of
many
wild
sad
nights
,
in
those
rides
;
reviving
,
as
I
went
,
the
*NL*
thoughts
that
had
occupied
me
in
my
long
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
,
if
I
were
to
say
rather
that
I
listened
to
the
echoes
of
those
*NL*
thoughts
,
I
should
better
express
the
truth
.
They
spoke
to
me
from
afar
*NL*
off
.
I
had
put
them
at
a
distance
,
and
accepted
my
inevitable
place
.
*NL*
When
I
read
to
Agnes
what
I
wrote
;
when
I
saw
her
listening
face
;
moved
*NL*
her
to
smiles
or
tears
;
and
heard
her
cordial
voice
so
earnest
on
the
*NL*
shadowy
events
of
that
imaginative
world
in
which
I
lived
;
I
thought
*NL*
what
a
fate
mine
might
have
been
--
but
only
thought
so
,
as
I
had
thought
*NL*
after
I
was
married
to
Dora
,
what
I
could
have
wished
my
wife
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
duty
to
Agnes
,
who
loved
me
with
a
love
,
which
,
if
I
disquieted
,
I
*NL*
wronged
most
selfishly
and
poorly
,
and
could
never
restore
;
my
matured
*NL*
assurance
that
I
,
who
had
worked
out
my
own
destiny
,
and
won
what
I
had
*NL*
impetuously
set
my
heart
on
,
had
no
right
to
murmur
,
and
must
bear
;
*NL*
comprised
what
I
felt
and
what
I
had
learned
.
But
I
loved
her
:
and
now
*NL*
it
even
became
some
consolation
to
me
,
vaguely
to
conceive
a
distant
day
*NL*
when
I
might
blamelessly
avow
it
;
when
all
this
should
be
over
;
when
I
*NL*
could
say
``
Agnes
,
so
it
was
when
I
came
home
;
and
now
I
am
old
,
and
I
*NL*
never
have
loved
since
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
once
show
me
any
change
in
herself
.
What
she
always
had
been
*NL*
to
me
,
she
still
was
;
wholly
unaltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
my
aunt
and
me
there
had
been
something
,
in
this
connexion
,
*NL*
since
the
night
of
my
return
,
which
I
can
not
call
a
restraint
,
or
an
*NL*
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
so
much
as
an
implied
understanding
that
we
*NL*
thought
of
it
together
,
but
did
not
shape
our
thoughts
into
words
.
When
,
*NL*
according
to
our
old
custom
,
we
sat
before
the
fire
at
night
,
we
often
*NL*
fell
into
this
train
;
as
naturally
,
and
as
consciously
to
each
other
,
as
*NL*
if
we
had
unreservedly
said
so
.
But
we
preserved
an
unbroken
silence
.
I
*NL*
believed
that
she
had
read
,
or
partly
read
,
my
thoughts
that
night
;
and
*NL*
that
she
fully
comprehended
why
I
gave
mine
no
more
distinct
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Christmas-time
being
come
,
and
Agnes
having
reposed
no
new
*NL*
confidence
in
me
,
a
doubt
that
had
several
times
arisen
in
my
*NL*
mind
--
whether
she
could
have
that
perception
of
the
true
state
of
*NL*
my
breast
,
which
restrained
her
with
the
apprehension
of
giving
me
*NL*
pain
--
began
to
oppress
me
heavily
.
If
that
were
so
,
my
sacrifice
was
*NL*
nothing
;
my
plainest
obligation
to
her
unfulfilled
;
and
every
poor
*NL*
action
I
had
shrunk
from
,
I
was
hourly
doing
.
I
resolved
to
set
this
*NL*
right
beyond
all
doubt
;
--
if
such
a
barrier
were
between
us
,
to
break
it
*NL*
down
at
once
with
a
determined
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
--
what
lasting
reason
have
I
to
remember
it
!
--
a
cold
,
harsh
,
*NL*
winter
day
.
There
had
been
snow
,
some
hours
before
;
and
it
lay
,
not
*NL*
deep
,
but
hard-frozen
on
the
ground
.
Out
at
sea
,
beyond
my
window
,
the
*NL*
wind
blew
ruggedly
from
the
north
.
I
had
been
thinking
of
it
,
sweeping
*NL*
over
those
mountain
wastes
of
snow
in
Switzerland
,
then
inaccessible
to
*NL*
any
human
foot
;
and
had
been
speculating
which
was
the
lonelier
,
those
*NL*
solitary
regions
,
or
a
deserted
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Riding
to-day
,
Trot
?
''
said
my
aunt
,
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
going
over
to
Canterbury
.
It
's
a
good
day
for
a
*NL*
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
your
horse
may
think
so
too
,
''
said
my
aunt
;
``
but
at
present
he
*NL*
is
holding
down
his
head
and
his
ears
,
standing
before
the
door
there
,
*NL*
as
if
he
thought
his
stable
preferable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
,
I
may
observe
,
allowed
my
horse
on
the
forbidden
ground
,
but
*NL*
had
not
at
all
relented
toward
the
donkeys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
be
fresh
enough
,
presently
!
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ride
will
do
his
master
good
,
at
all
events
,
''
observed
my
aunt
,
*NL*
glancing
at
the
papers
on
my
table
.
``
Ah
,
child
,
you
pass
a
good
many
*NL*
hours
here
!
I
never
thought
,
when
I
used
to
read
books
,
what
work
it
was
*NL*
to
write
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
work
enough
to
read
them
,
sometimes
,
''
I
returned
.
``
As
to
the
*NL*
writing
,
it
has
its
own
charms
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
see
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
Ambition
,
love
of
approbation
,
sympathy
,
and
*NL*
much
more
,
I
suppose
?
Well
:
go
along
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
anything
more
,
''
said
I
,
standing
composedly
before
her
--
she
*NL*
had
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
sat
down
in
my
chair
,
``
of
that
*NL*
attachment
of
Agnes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
in
my
face
a
little
while
,
before
replying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
,
Trot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
confirmed
in
your
impression
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
am
,
Trot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
so
steadfastly
at
me
:
with
a
kind
of
doubt
,
or
pity
,
or
*NL*
suspense
in
her
affection
:
that
I
summoned
the
stronger
determination
to
*NL*
show
her
a
perfectly
cheerful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
more
,
Trot
--
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
Agnes
is
going
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
her
!
''
said
I
,
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
her
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
``
and
her
husband
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
echoed
it
,
parted
from
my
aunt
,
went
lightly
down
stairs
,
mounted
,
and
*NL*
rode
away
.
There
was
greater
reason
than
before
to
do
what
I
had
*NL*
resolved
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
well
I
recollect
the
wintry
ride
!
The
frozen
particles
of
ice
,
*NL*
brushed
from
the
blades
of
grass
by
the
wind
,
and
borne
across
my
face
;
*NL*
the
hard
clatter
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
,
beating
a
tune
upon
the
ground
;
*NL*
the
stiff-tilled
soil
;
the
snow-drift
,
lightly
eddying
in
the
chalk-pit
*NL*
as
the
breeze
ruffled
it
;
the
smoking
team
with
the
waggon
of
old
hay
,
*NL*
stopping
to
breathe
on
the
hill-top
,
and
shaking
their
bells
musically
;
*NL*
the
whitened
slopes
and
sweeps
of
Down-land
lying
against
the
dark
sky
,
*NL*
as
if
they
were
drawn
on
a
huge
slate
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Agnes
alone
.
The
little
girls
had
gone
to
their
own
homes
now
,
*NL*
and
she
was
alone
by
the
fire
,
reading
.
She
put
down
her
book
on
seeing
*NL*
me
come
in
;
and
having
welcomed
me
as
usual
,
took
her
work-basket
and
*NL*
sat
in
one
of
the
old-fashioned
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
beside
her
on
the
window-seat
,
and
we
talked
of
what
I
was
doing
,
*NL*
and
when
it
would
be
done
,
and
of
the
progress
I
had
made
since
my
last
*NL*
visit
.
Agnes
was
very
cheerful
;
and
laughingly
predicted
that
I
should
*NL*
soon
become
too
famous
to
be
talked
to
,
on
such
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
make
the
most
of
the
present
time
,
you
see
,
''
said
Agnes
,
``
and
talk
*NL*
to
you
while
I
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
looked
at
her
beautiful
face
,
observant
of
her
work
,
she
raised
her
*NL*
mild
clear
eyes
,
and
saw
that
I
was
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
thoughtful
to-day
,
Trotwood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
,
shall
I
tell
you
what
about
?
I
came
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
aside
her
work
,
as
she
was
used
to
do
when
we
were
seriously
*NL*
discussing
anything
;
and
gave
me
her
whole
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Agnes
,
do
you
doubt
my
being
true
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
answered
,
with
a
look
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
doubt
my
being
what
I
always
have
been
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
answered
,
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
that
I
tried
to
tell
you
,
when
I
came
home
,
what
a
debt
*NL*
of
gratitude
I
owed
you
,
dearest
Agnes
,
and
how
fervently
I
felt
towards
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
it
,
''
she
said
,
gently
,
``
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
secret
,
''
said
I.
``
Let
me
share
it
,
Agnes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cast
down
her
eyes
,
and
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
hardly
fail
to
know
,
even
if
I
had
not
heard
--
but
from
other
*NL*
lips
than
yours
,
Agnes
,
which
seems
strange
--
that
there
is
some
one
upon
*NL*
whom
you
have
bestowed
the
treasure
of
your
love
.
Do
not
shut
me
out
of
*NL*
what
concerns
your
happiness
so
nearly
!
If
you
can
trust
me
,
as
you
say
*NL*
you
can
,
and
as
I
know
you
may
,
let
me
be
your
friend
,
your
brother
,
in
*NL*
this
matter
,
of
all
others
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
appealing
,
almost
a
reproachful
,
glance
,
she
rose
from
the
*NL*
window
;
and
hurrying
across
the
room
as
if
without
knowing
where
,
put
*NL*
her
hands
before
her
face
,
and
burst
into
such
tears
as
smote
me
to
the
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
they
awakened
something
in
me
,
bringing
promise
to
my
heart
.
*NL*
Without
my
knowing
why
,
these
tears
allied
themselves
with
the
quietly
*NL*
sad
smile
which
was
so
fixed
in
my
remembrance
,
and
shook
me
more
with
*NL*
hope
than
fear
or
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes

Sister
!
Dearest

What
have
I
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

will
speak
*NL*
to
you
by
and
by
--
another
time
.
I
will
write
to
you

Do
n't
speak
to
me
*NL*
now
.
Do
n't
!
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sought
to
recollect
what
she
had
said
,
when
I
had
spoken
to
her
on
*NL*
that
former
night
,
of
her
affection
needing
no
return
.
It
seemed
a
very
*NL*
world
that
I
must
search
through
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
,
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
,
and
think
that
I
have
been
the
*NL*
cause
.
My
dearest
girl
,
dearer
to
me
than
anything
in
life
,
if
you
are
*NL*
unhappy
,
let
me
share
your
unhappiness
.
If
you
are
in
need
of
help
or
*NL*
counsel
,
let
me
try
to
give
it
to
you
.
If
you
have
indeed
a
burden
on
*NL*
your
heart
,
let
me
try
to
lighten
it
.
For
whom
do
I
live
now
,
Agnes
,
if
*NL*
it
is
not
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
spare
me
!
I
am
not
myself
!
Another
time
!
''
was
all
I
could
*NL*
distinguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
a
selfish
error
that
was
leading
me
away
?
Or
,
having
once
a
clue
*NL*
to
hope
,
was
there
something
opening
to
me
that
I
had
not
dared
to
think
*NL*
of
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
more
.
I
can
not
let
you
leave
me
so
!
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
*NL*
Agnes
,
let
us
not
mistake
each
other
after
all
these
years
,
and
all
that
*NL*
has
come
and
gone
with
them
!
I
must
speak
plainly
.
If
you
have
any
*NL*
lingering
thought
that
I
could
envy
the
happiness
you
will
confer
;
that
*NL*
I
could
not
resign
you
to
a
dearer
protector
,
of
your
own
choosing
;
that
*NL*
I
could
not
,
from
my
removed
place
,
be
a
contented
witness
of
your
joy
;
*NL*
dismiss
it
,
for
I
do
n't
deserve
it
!
I
have
not
suffered
quite
in
vain
.
*NL*
You
have
not
taught
me
quite
in
vain
.
There
is
no
alloy
of
self
in
what
*NL*
I
feel
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
quiet
now
.
In
a
little
time
,
she
turned
her
pale
face
towards
*NL*
me
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
,
broken
here
and
there
,
but
very
clear
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
owe
it
to
your
pure
friendship
for
me
,
Trotwood
--
which
,
indeed
,
I
do
*NL*
not
doubt
--
to
tell
you
,
you
are
mistaken
.
I
can
do
no
more
.
If
I
have
*NL*
sometimes
,
in
the
course
of
years
,
wanted
help
and
counsel
,
they
have
*NL*
come
to
me
.
If
I
have
sometimes
been
unhappy
,
the
feeling
has
passed
*NL*
away
.
If
I
have
ever
had
a
burden
on
my
heart
,
it
has
been
lightened
for
*NL*
me
.
If
I
have
any
secret
,
it
is
--
no
new
one
;
and
is
--
not
what
you
*NL*
suppose
.
I
can
not
reveal
it
,
or
divide
it
.
It
has
long
been
mine
,
and
*NL*
must
remain
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
!
Stay
!
A
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
away
,
but
I
detained
her
.
I
clasped
my
arm
about
her
*NL*
waist
.
``
In
the
course
of
years
!
''
``
It
is
not
a
new
one
!
''
New
thoughts
and
*NL*
hopes
were
whirling
through
my
mind
,
and
all
the
colors
of
my
life
were
*NL*
changing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Agnes
!
Whom
I
so
respect
and
honor
--
whom
I
so
devotedly
love

*NL*
When
I
came
here
to-day
,
I
thought
that
nothing
could
have
wrested
this
*NL*
confession
from
me
.
I
thought
I
could
have
kept
it
in
my
bosom
all
our
*NL*
lives
,
till
we
were
old
.
But
,
Agnes
,
if
I
have
indeed
any
new-born
hope
*NL*
that
I
may
ever
call
you
something
more
than
Sister
,
widely
different
*NL*
from
Sister
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tears
fell
fast
;
but
they
were
not
like
those
she
had
lately
shed
,
*NL*
and
I
saw
my
hope
brighten
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
!
Ever
my
guide
,
and
best
support
!
If
you
had
been
more
mindful
of
*NL*
yourself
,
and
less
of
me
,
when
we
grew
up
here
together
,
I
think
my
*NL*
heedless
fancy
never
would
have
wandered
from
you
.
But
you
were
so
much
*NL*
better
than
I
,
so
necessary
to
me
in
every
boyish
hope
and
*NL*
disappointment
,
that
to
have
you
to
confide
in
,
and
rely
upon
in
*NL*
everything
,
became
a
second
nature
,
supplanting
for
the
time
the
first
*NL*
and
greater
one
of
loving
you
as
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
weeping
,
but
not
sadly
--
joyfully
!
And
clasped
in
my
arms
as
she
*NL*
had
never
been
,
as
I
had
thought
she
never
was
to
be
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
loved
Dora

fondly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
cried

earnestly
.

I
am
glad

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
loved

then

have
been
incomplete

*NL*
without
your

had
it
,
and
it
was
perfected

And
when
I
lost
*NL*
her

Agnes

what
should
I
have
been
without
you

still

*NL*
*NL*
Closer
in
my
arms
,
nearer
to
my
heart
,
her
trembling
hand
upon
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
her
sweet
eyes
shining
through
her
tears
,
on
mine
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
away

dear
Agnes

loving
you

I
stayed
away

loving
you

I
*NL*
returned
home
,
loving
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
I
tried
to
tell
her
of
the
struggle
I
had
had
,
and
the
*NL*
conclusion
I
had
come
to
.
I
tried
to
lay
my
mind
before
her
,
truly
,
and
*NL*
entirely
.
I
tried
to
show
her
,
how
I
had
hoped
I
had
come
into
the
*NL*
better
knowledge
of
myself
and
of
her
;
how
I
had
resigned
myself
to
what
*NL*
that
better
knowledge
brought
;
and
how
I
had
come
there
,
even
that
day
,
*NL*
in
my
fidelity
to
this
.
If
she
did
so
love
me
-LRB-
I
said
-RRB-
that
she
could
*NL*
take
me
for
her
husband
,
she
could
do
so
,
on
no
deserving
of
mine
,
*NL*
except
upon
the
truth
of
my
love
for
her
,
and
the
trouble
in
which
it
*NL*
had
ripened
to
be
what
it
was
;
and
hence
it
was
that
I
revealed
it
.
And
*NL*
O
,
Agnes
,
even
out
of
thy
true
eyes
,
in
that
same
time
,
the
spirit
of
my
*NL*
child-wife
looked
upon
me
,
saying
it
was
well
;
and
winning
me
,
through
*NL*
thee
,
to
tenderest
recollections
of
the
Blossom
that
had
withered
in
its
*NL*
bloom
!
*NL*
*NL*

*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
blest

Trotwood

my
heart
is
so
overcharged

but
there
is
one
*NL*
thing
I
must
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
gentle
hands
upon
my
shoulders
,
and
looked
calmly
in
my
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
yet
,
what
it
is
?

*NL*
*NL*

I

*NL*
*NL*
O
,
we
were
happy
,
we
were
happy
!
Our
tears
were
not
for
the
trials
-LRB-
hers
*NL*
so
much
the
greater
-RRB-
,
through
which
we
had
come
to
be
thus
,
but
for
the
*NL*
rapture
of
being
thus
,
never
to
be
divided
more
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
,
that
winter
evening
,
in
the
fields
together
;
and
the
blessed
*NL*
calm
within
us
seemed
to
be
partaken
by
the
frosty
air
.
The
early
stars
*NL*
began
to
shine
while
we
were
lingering
on
,
and
looking
up
to
them
we
*NL*
thanked
our
GOD
for
having
guided
us
to
this
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
together
in
the
same
old-fashioned
window
at
night
,
when
the
*NL*
moon
was
shining
;
Agnes
with
her
quiet
eyes
raised
up
to
it
;
I
following
*NL*
her
glance
.
Long
miles
of
road
then
opened
out
before
my
mind
;
and
,
*NL*
toiling
on
,
I
saw
a
ragged
way-worn
boy
,
forsaken
and
neglected
,
who
*NL*
should
come
to
call
even
the
heart
now
beating
against
mine
,
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
dinner-time
next
day
when
we
appeared
before
my
aunt
.
She
*NL*
was
up
in
my
study
,
Peggotty
said
:
which
it
was
her
pride
to
keep
in
*NL*
readiness
and
order
for
me
.
We
found
her
,
in
her
spectacles
,
sitting
by
*NL*
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
me
!
''
said
my
aunt
,
peering
through
the
dusk
,
``
who
's
this
*NL*
you
're
bringing
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agnes
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
had
arranged
to
say
nothing
at
first
,
my
aunt
was
not
a
little
*NL*
discomfited
.
She
darted
a
hopeful
glance
at
me
,
when
I
said
``
Agnes
;
''
but
*NL*
seeing
that
I
looked
as
usual
,
she
took
off
her
spectacles
in
despair
,
*NL*
and
rubbed
her
nose
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
greeted
Agnes
heartily
,
nevertheless
;
and
we
were
soon
in
the
*NL*
lighted
parlor
down
stairs
,
at
dinner
.
My
aunt
put
on
her
spectacles
*NL*
twice
or
thrice
,
to
take
another
look
at
me
,
but
as
often
took
them
off
*NL*
again
,
disappointed
,
and
rubbed
her
nose
with
them
.
Much
to
the
*NL*
discomfiture
of
Mr.
Dick
,
who
knew
this
to
be
a
bad
symptom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
by
,
aunt
,
''
said
I
,
after
dinner
;
``
I
have
been
speaking
to
Agnes
*NL*
about
what
you
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Trot
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
turning
scarlet
,
``
you
did
wrong
,
and
broke
*NL*
your
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
angry
,
aunt
,
I
trust
?
I
am
sure
you
wo
n't
be
,
when
you
*NL*
learn
that
Agnes
is
not
unhappy
in
any
attachment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
aunt
appeared
to
be
annoyed
,
I
thought
the
best
way
was
to
cut
her
*NL*
annoyance
short
.
I
took
Agnes
in
my
arm
to
the
back
of
her
chair
,
and
we
*NL*
both
leaned
over
her
.
My
aunt
,
with
one
clap
of
her
hands
,
and
one
look
*NL*
through
her
spectacles
,
immediately
went
into
hysterics
,
for
the
first
*NL*
and
only
time
in
all
my
knowledge
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hysterics
called
up
Peggotty
.
The
moment
my
aunt
was
restored
,
she
*NL*
flew
at
Peggotty
,
and
calling
her
a
silly
old
creature
,
hugged
her
with
*NL*
all
her
might
.
After
that
,
she
hugged
Mr.
Dick
-LRB-
who
was
highly
honored
,
*NL*
but
a
good
deal
surprised
-RRB-
;
and
after
that
,
told
them
why
.
Then
,
we
were
*NL*
all
happy
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
discover
whether
my
aunt
,
in
her
last
short
conversation
*NL*
with
me
,
had
fallen
on
a
pious
fraud
,
or
had
really
mistaken
the
state
*NL*
of
my
mind
.
It
was
quite
enough
,
she
said
,
that
she
had
told
me
Agnes
*NL*
was
going
to
be
married
;
and
that
I
now
knew
better
than
any
one
how
*NL*
true
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
married
within
a
fortnight
.
Traddles
and
Sophy
,
and
Doctor
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Strong
,
were
the
only
guests
at
our
quiet
wedding
.
We
left
them
*NL*
full
of
joy
;
and
drove
away
together
.
Clasped
in
my
embrace
,
I
held
the
*NL*
source
of
every
worthy
aspiration
I
had
ever
had
;
the
centre
of
myself
,
*NL*
the
circle
of
my
life
,
my
own
,
my
wife
;
my
love
of
whom
was
founded
on
a
*NL*
rock
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
husband
!
''
said
Agnes
.
``
Now
that
I
may
call
you
by
that
name
,
I
*NL*
have
one
thing
more
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
hear
it
,
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
grows
out
of
the
night
when
Dora
died
.
She
sent
you
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
told
me
that
she
left
me
something

Can
you
think
what
it
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believed
I
could
.
I
drew
the
wife
who
had
so
long
loved
me
,
closer
to
*NL*
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
told
me
that
she
made
a
last
request
to
me
,
and
left
me
a
last
*NL*
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
was
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
only
I
would
occupy
this
vacant
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Agnes
laid
her
head
upon
my
breast
,
and
wept
;
and
I
wept
with
her
,
*NL*
though
we
were
so
happy

CHAPTER
LXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
VISITOR
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
have
purposed
to
record
is
nearly
finished
;
but
there
is
yet
an
*NL*
incident
conspicuous
in
my
memory
,
on
which
it
often
rests
with
delight
,
*NL*
and
without
which
one
thread
in
the
web
I
have
spun
,
would
have
a
*NL*
ravelled
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
advanced
in
fame
and
fortune
,
my
domestic
joy
was
perfect
,
I
had
*NL*
been
married
ten
happy
years
.
Agnes
and
I
were
sitting
by
the
fire
,
in
*NL*
our
house
in
London
,
one
night
in
spring
,
and
three
of
our
children
were
*NL*
playing
in
the
room
,
when
I
was
told
that
a
stranger
wished
to
see
me
.

Stranger

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
asked
if
he
came
on
business
,
and
had
answered
No
;
he
had
*NL*
come
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
,
and
had
come
a
long
way
.
He
was
an
*NL*
old
man
,
my
servant
said
,
and
looked
like
a
farmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
sounded
mysterious
to
the
children
,
and
moreover
was
like
the
*NL*
beginning
of
a
favorite
story
Agnes
used
to
tell
them
,
introductory
to
*NL*
the
arrival
of
a
wicked
old
Fairy
in
a
cloak
who
hated
every
body
,
it
*NL*
produced
some
commotion
.
One
of
our
boys
laid
his
head
in
his
mother
's
*NL*
lap
to
be
out
of
harm
's
way
,
and
little
Agnes
-LRB-
our
eldest
child
-RRB-
left
*NL*
her
doll
in
a
chair
to
represent
her
,
and
thrust
out
her
little
heap
of
*NL*
golden
curls
from
between
the
window-curtains
,
to
see
what
happened
*NL*
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
come
in
here
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
soon
appeared
,
pausing
in
the
dark
doorway
as
he
entered
,
a
hale
,
*NL*
grey-haired
old
man
.
Little
Agnes
,
attracted
by
his
looks
,
had
run
to
*NL*
bring
him
in
,
and
I
had
not
yet
clearly
seen
his
face
,
when
my
wife
,
*NL*
starting
up
,
cried
out
to
me
,
in
a
pleased
and
agitated
voice
,
that
it
*NL*
was
Mr.
Peggotty
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
_
was
_
Mr.
Peggotty
.
An
old
man
now
,
but
in
a
ruddy
,
hearty
,
strong
*NL*
old
age
.
When
our
first
emotion
was
over
,
and
he
sat
before
the
fire
*NL*
with
the
children
on
his
knees
,
and
the
blaze
shining
on
his
face
,
he
*NL*
looked
,
to
me
,
as
vigorous
and
robust
,
withal
as
handsome
,
an
old
man
,
*NL*
as
ever
I
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
''
said
he
.
And
the
old
name
in
the
old
tone
fell
so
*NL*
naturally
on
my
ear
!
``
Mas
'
r
Davy
,
't
is
a
joyful
hour
as
I
see

once
*NL*
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
these

said
Mr.
Peggotty
.
``
To

you

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
I.
*NL*
``

I

-RRB-
,
and
then
,
over
a
glass
*NL*
of

,
we
will
have
the

of
ten
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
alone
?
''
asked
Agnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
''
he
said
,
kissing
her
hand
,
``
quite
alone

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
him
between
us
,
not
knowing
how
to
give
him
welcome
enough
;
and
*NL*
as
I
began
to
listen
to
his
old
familiar
voice
,
I
could
have
fancied
he
*NL*
was
still
pursuing
his
long
journey
in
search
of
his
darling
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
mort
of

said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
``

Which
is
*NL*
verse

''
said
Mr.
Peggotty
,
surprised
to
find
it
out
,
``
though
I
had
n't
*NL*
such
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

going

asked
Agnes

he
returned
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
us
,
as
if
he
could
never
feast
his
eyes
on
us
sufficiently
.
*NL*
Agnes
laughingly
put
back
some
scattered
locks
of
his
grey
hair
,
that
he
*NL*
might
see
us
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

,

overspread

drew

looked

up
from

suddenly
burst
into

rubbed

could

*NL*
Mr.

,
with
a

,
put
his
hand
in
his
breast-pocket

and
*NL*
produced
a
flat-folded

paper

from
which
he
took
out

with
much

Mr.

pointed
to
a

paragraph
in

read
aloud

,
from
the
``
Port

:

The
public
dinner
to
our
distinguished
fellow-colonist
and
*NL*
townsman
,
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
ESQUIRE
,
Port
Middlebay
District
*NL*
Magistrate
,
came
off
yesterday
in
the
large
room
of
the
Hotel
,
*NL*
which
was
crowded
to
suffocation
.
It
is
estimated
that
not
*NL*
fewer
than
forty-seven
persons
must
have
been
accommodated
with
*NL*
dinner
at
one
time
,
exclusive
of
the
company
in
the
passage
and
*NL*
on
the
stairs
.
The
beauty
,
fashion
,
and
exclusiveness
of
Port
*NL*
Middlebay
,
flocked
to
do
honor
to
one
so
deservedly
esteemed
,
so
*NL*
highly
talented
,
and
so
widely
popular
.
Doctor
Mell
-LRB-
of
Colonial
*NL*
Salem-House
Grammar
School
,
Port
Middlebay
-RRB-
presided
,
and
on
*NL*
his
right
sat
the
distinguished
guest
.
After
the
removal
of
the
*NL*
cloth
,
and
the
singing
of
Non
Nobis
-LRB-
beautifully
executed
,
and
*NL*
in
which
we
were
at
no
loss
to
distinguish
the
bell-like
notes
*NL*
of
that
gifted
amateur
,
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
ESQUIRE
,
JUNIOR
-RRB-
,
*NL*
the
usual
loyal
and
patriotic
toasts
were
severally
given
and
*NL*
rapturously
received
.
Doctor
Mell
,
in
a
speech
replete
with
*NL*
feeling
,
then
proposed
`
Our
distinguished
Guest
,
the
ornament
of
*NL*
our
town
.
May
he
never
leave
us
but
to
better
himself
,
and
may
*NL*
his
success
among
us
be
such
as
to
render
his
bettering
himself
*NL*
impossible
!
'
The
cheering
with
which
the
toast
was
received
*NL*
defies
description
.
Again
and
again
it
rose
and
fell
,
like
the
*NL*
waves
of
ocean
.
At
length
all
was
hushed
,
and
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
*NL*
ESQUIRE
,
presented
himself
to
return
thanks
.
Far
be
it
from
us
,
*NL*
in
the
present
comparatively
imperfect
state
of
the
resources
*NL*
of
our
establishment
,
to
endeavour
to
follow
our
distinguished
*NL*
townsman
through
the
smoothly-flowing
periods
of
his
polished
*NL*
and
highly-ornate
address
!
Suffice
it
to
observe
,
that
it
was
a
*NL*
masterpiece
of
eloquence
;
and
that
those
passages
in
which
he
*NL*
more
particularly
traced
his
own
successful
career
to
its
source
,
*NL*
and
warned
the
younger
portion
of
his
auditory
from
the
shoals
*NL*
of
ever
incurring
pecuniary
liabilities
which
they
were
unable
*NL*
to
liquidate
,
brought
a
tear
into
the
manliest
eye
present
.
The
*NL*
remaining
toasts
were
DOCTOR
MELL
;
MRS.
MICAWBER
-LRB-
who
gracefully
*NL*
bowed
her
acknowledgments
from
the
side-door
,
where
a
galaxy
*NL*
of
beauty
was
elevated
on
chairs
,
at
once
to
witness
and
adorn
*NL*
the
gratifying
scene
-RRB-
;
MRS.
RIDGER
BEGS
-LRB-
late
Miss
Micawber
-RRB-
;
*NL*
MRS.
MELL
;
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
ESQUIRE
,
JUNIOR
-LRB-
who
convulsed
the
*NL*
assembly
by
humorously
remarking
that
he
found
himself
unable
to
*NL*
return
thanks
in
a
speech
,
but
would
do
so
,
with
their
permission
,
*NL*
in
a
song
-RRB-
;
MRS.
MICAWBER
'S
FAMILY
-LRB-
well-known
,
it
is
needless
to
*NL*
remark
,
in
the
mother-country
-RRB-
,
&
c.

At
the
conclusion
*NL*
of
the
proceedings
the
tables
were
cleared
as
if
by
art-magic
*NL*
for
dancing
.
Among
the
votaries
of
TERPSICHORE

who
disported
*NL*
themselves
until
Sol
gave
warning
for
departure

Wilkins

and
the
lovely

accomplished
Miss

particularly
remarkable

I

Mr.

Mr.

another

*NL*
*NL*
I
found
,
on
glancing
at
the
remaining
contents
of
the
newspaper
,
that
*NL*
Mr.
Micawber
was
a
diligent
and
esteemed
correspondent
of
that
Journal
.
*NL*
There
was
another
letter
from
him
in
the
same
paper
,
touching
a
bridge
;
*NL*
there
was
an
advertisement
of
a
collection
of
similar
letters
by
him
,
to
*NL*
be
shortly
republished
,
in
a
neat
volume
,
``
with
considerable
additions
;
''
*NL*
and
,
unless
I
am
very
much
mistaken
,
the
Leading
Article
was
his
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
talked
much
of
Mr.
Micawber
,
on
many
other
evenings
while
Mr.
*NL*
Peggotty
remained
with
us
.
He
lived
with
us
during
the
whole
term
of
his
*NL*
stay
,
--
which
,
I
think
,
was
something
less
than
a
month
,
--
and
his
sister
*NL*
and
my
aunt
came
to
London
to
see
him
.
Agnes
and
I
parted
from
him
*NL*

when
he
sailed
;
and
we
shall
never
part
from
him
more
,
on

earth

*NL*
*NL*
But
before
he
left
,
he
went
with
me
to
Yarmouth
,
to
see
a
little
tablet
*NL*
I
had
put
up
in
the
churchyard
to
the
memory
of
Ham
.
While
I
was
copying
*NL*
the
plain
inscription
for
him
at
his
request
,
I
saw
him
stoop
,
and
*NL*
gather
a
tuft
of
grass
from
the
grave
,
and
a
little
earth
.
*NL*

``

*NL*
*NL*
A
LAST
RETROSPECT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
my
written
story
ends
.
I
look
back
,
once
more
--
for
the
last
*NL*
time
--
before
I
close
these
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
myself
,
with
Agnes
at
my
side
,
journeying
along
the
road
of
life
.
*NL*
I
see
our
children
and
our
friends
around
us
;
and
I
hear
the
roar
of
*NL*
many
voices
,
not
indifferent
to
me
as
I
travel
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
faces
are
the
most
distinct
to
me
in
the
fleeting
crowd
?
Lo
,
these
;
*NL*
all
turning
to
me
as
I
ask
my
thoughts
the
question
!
*NL*
*NL*
Here
is
my
aunt
,
in
stronger
spectacles
,
an
old
woman
of
fourscore
years
*NL*
and
more
,
but
upright
yet
,
and
a
steady
walker
of
six
miles
at
a
stretch
*NL*
in
winter
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
with
her
,
here
comes
Peggotty
,
my
good
old
nurse
,
likewise
in
*NL*
spectacles
,
accustomed
to
do
needlework
at
night
very
close
to
the
lamp
,
*NL*
but
never
sitting
down
to
it
without
a
bit
of
wax
candle
,
a
yard
measure
*NL*
in
a
little
house
,
and
a
work-box
with
a
picture
of
St.
Paul
's
upon
the
*NL*
lid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cheeks
and
arms
of
Peggotty
,
so
hard
and
red
in
my
childish
days
,
*NL*
when
I
wondered
why
the
birds
did
n't
peck
her
in
preference
to
apples
,
*NL*
are
shrivelled
now
;
and
her
eyes
,
that
used
to
darken
their
whole
*NL*
neighbourhood
in
her
face
,
are
fainter
-LRB-
though
they
glitter
still
-RRB-
;
but
*NL*
her
rough
forefinger
,
which
I
once
associated
with
a
pocket
nutmeg
*NL*
grater
,
is
just
the
same
,
and
when
I
see
my
least
child
catching
at
it
*NL*
as
it
totters
from
my
aunt
to
her
,
I
think
of
our
little
parlor
at
home
,
*NL*
when
I
could
scarcely
walk
.
My
aunt
's
old
disappointment
is
set
right
,
*NL*
now
.
She
is
godmother
to
a
real
living
Betsey
Trotwood
;
and
Dora
-LRB-
the
*NL*
next
in
order
-RRB-
says
she
spoils
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
bulky
in
Peggotty
's
pocket
.
It
is
nothing
smaller
*NL*
than
the
Crocodile-Book
,
which
is
in
rather
a
dilapidated
condition
by
*NL*
this
time
,
with
divers
of
the
leaves
torn
and
stitched
across
,
but
which
*NL*
Peggotty
exhibits
to
the
children
as
a
precious
relic
.
I
find
it
very
*NL*
curious
to
see
my
own
infant
face
,
looking
up
at
me
from
the
Crocodile
*NL*
stories
;
and
to
be
reminded
by
it
of
my
old
acquaintance
Brooks
of
*NL*
Sheffield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
my
boys
,
this
summer
holiday
time
,
I
see
an
old
man
making
giant
*NL*
kites
,
and
gazing
at
them
in
the
air
,
with
a
delight
for
which
there
are
*NL*
no
words
.
He
greets
me
rapturously
,
and
whispers
,
with
many
nods
and
*NL*
winks
,
``
Trotwood
,
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
I
shall
finish
the
*NL*
Memorial
when
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
that
your
aunt
's
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
woman
in
the
world
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
is
this
bent
lady
,
supporting
herself
by
a
stick
,
and
showing
me
a
*NL*
countenance
in
which
there
are
some
traces
of
old
pride
and
beauty
,
*NL*
feebly
contending
with
a
querulous
,
imbecile
,
fretful
wandering
of
the
*NL*
mind
?
She
is
in
a
garden
;
and
near
her
stands
a
sharp
,
dark
,
withered
*NL*
woman
,
with
a
white
scar
on
her
lip
.
Let
me
hear
what
they
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosa
,
I
have
forgotten
this
gentleman
's
name

*NL*
*NL*
Rosa
bends
over
her
,
and
calls
to
her
,
``
Mr.
Copperfield

*NL*
*NL*
``

am
glad

hope
Time
will
be
good
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
Her
impatient
attendant
scolds
her
,
tells
her
I
am
not
in
mourning
,
bids
*NL*
her
look
again
,
tries
to
rouse
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
my
son
,

,
''
says
the
elder
lady
.
``
Are
you
reconciled

''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
fixedly
at
me
,
she
puts
her
hand
to
her
forehead
,
and
moans
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
she
cries
,
in
a
terrible
voice
,
``
Rosa

to
me

He
is
*NL*
dead

Rosa
,
kneeling
at
her
feet
,
by
turns
caresses
her
,
and
quarrels
*NL*
with
her
;
now
fiercely
telling
her
,
``

did
!
''
--
now
soothing
her
to
sleep
on
her
breast
,
like
a
sick
child
.
Thus
*NL*
I
leave
them
;
thus
I
always
find
them
;
thus
they
wear
their
time
away
,
*NL*
from
year
to
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
ship
comes
sailing
home
from
India
,
and
what
English
lady
is
this
,
*NL*
married
to
a
growling
old
Scotch
Croesus
with
great
flaps
of
ears
.
Can
*NL*
this
be
Julia
Mills
?
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
it
is
Julia
Mills
,
peevish
and
fine
,
with
a
black
man
to
carry
*NL*
cards
and
letters
to
her
on
a
golden
salver
,
and
a
copper-colored
woman
*NL*
in
linen
,
with
a
bright
handkerchief
round
her
head
,
to
serve
her
Tiffin
*NL*
in
her
dressing-room
.
But
Julia
keeps
no
diary
in
these
days
;
never
*NL*
sings
Affection
's
Dirge
;
eternally
quarrels
with
the
old
Scotch
Croesus
,
*NL*
who
is
a
sort
of
yellow
bear
with
a
tanned
hide
.
Julia
is
steeped
in
*NL*
money
to
the
throat
,
and
talks
and
thinks
of
nothing
else
.
I
liked
her
*NL*
better
in
the
Desert
of
Sahara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
perhaps
this
_
is
_
the
Desert
of
Sahara
!
For
,
though
Julia
has
a
*NL*
stately
house
,
and
mighty
company
,
and
sumptuous
dinners
every
day
,
I
*NL*
see
no
green
growth
near
her
;
nothing
that
can
ever
come
to
fruit
or
*NL*
flower
.
What
Julia
calls
``
society
,
''
I
see
;
among
it
Mr.
Jack
Maldon
,
*NL*
from
his
Patent
Place
,
sneering
at
the
hand
that
gave
it
him
,
and
*NL*
speaking
to
me
,
of
the
Doctor
,
as
``
so
charmingly
antique
.
''
But
when
*NL*
society
is
the
name
for
such
hollow
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
Julia
,
and
*NL*
when
its
breeding
is
professed
indifference
to
everything
that
can
*NL*
advance
or
can
retard
mankind
,
I
think
we
must
have
lost
ourselves
in
*NL*
that
same
Desert
of
Sahara
,
and
had
better
find
the
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
lo
,
the
Doctor
,
always
our
good
friend
,
laboring
at
his
Dictionary
*NL*
-LRB-
somewhere
about
the
letter
D
-RRB-
,
and
happy
in
his
home
and
wife
.
Also
the
*NL*
Old
Soldier
,
on
a
considerably
reduced
footing
,
and
by
no
means
so
*NL*
influential
as
in
days
of
yore
!
*NL*
*NL*
Working
at
his
chambers
in
the
Temple
,
with
a
busy
aspect
,
and
his
hair
*NL*
-LRB-
where
he
is
not
bald
-RRB-
made
more
rebellious
than
ever
by
the
constant
*NL*
friction
of
his
lawyer
's
-
wig
,
I
come
,
in
a
later
time
,
upon
my
dear
old
*NL*
Traddles
.
His
table
is
covered
with
thick
piles
of
papers
;
and
I
say
,
as
*NL*
I
look
around
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Sophy
were
your
clerk
,
now
,
Traddles
,
she
would
have
enough
to
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
that
,
my
dear
Copperfield
!
But
those
were
capital
days
,
*NL*
too
,
in
Holborn
Court
!
Were
they
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
told
you
you
would
be
a
Judge
?
But
it
was
not
the
town
talk
*NL*
_
then
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
''
says
Traddles
,
``
if
I
ever
am
one
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
you
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
_
when
_
I
am
one
,
I
shall
tell
the
story
,
as
*NL*
I
said
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walk
away
,
arm
in
arm
.
I
am
going
to
have
a
family
dinner
with
*NL*
Traddles
.
It
is
Sophy
's
birthday
;
and
,
on
our
road
,
Traddles
discourses
*NL*
to
me
of
the
good
fortune
he
has
enjoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
have
been
able
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
to
do
all
that
I
had
most
*NL*
at
heart
.
There
's
the
Reverend
Horace
promoted
to
that
living
at
four
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
;
there
are
our
two
boys
receiving
the
*NL*
very
best
education
,
and
distinguishing
themselves
as
steady
scholars
*NL*
and
good
fellows
;
there
are
three
of
the
girls
married
very
comfortably
;
*NL*
there
are
three
more
living
with
us
;
there
are
three
more
keeping
house
*NL*
for
the
Reverend
Horace
since
Mrs.
Crewler
's
decease
;
and
all
of
them
*NL*
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
--
''
I
suggest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
the
Beauty
,
''
says
Traddles
.
``
Yes
.
It
was
very
unfortunate
that
*NL*
she
should
marry
such
a
vagabond
.
But
there
was
a
certain
dash
and
glare
*NL*
about
him
that
caught
her
.
However
,
now
we
have
got
her
safe
at
our
*NL*
house
,
and
got
rid
of
him
,
we
must
cheer
her
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Traddles
's
house
is
one
of
the
very
houses
--
or
it
easily
may
have
*NL*
been
--
which
he
and
Sophy
used
to
parcel
out
,
in
their
evening
walks
.
It
*NL*
is
a
large
house
;
but
Traddles
keeps
his
papers
in
his
dressing-room
,
*NL*
and
his
boots
with
his
papers
;
and
he
and
Sophy
squeeze
themselves
*NL*
into
upper
rooms
,
reserving
the
best
bed-rooms
for
the
Beauty
and
the
*NL*
girls
.
There
is
no
room
to
spare
in
the
house
;
for
more
of
``
the
girls
''
*NL*
are
here
,
and
always
are
here
,
by
some
accident
or
other
,
than
I
know
*NL*
how
to
count
.
Here
,
when
we
go
in
,
is
a
crowd
of
them
,
running
down
to
*NL*
the
door
,
and
handing
Traddles
about
to
be
kissed
,
until
he
is
out
of
*NL*
breath
.
Here
,
established
in
perpetuity
,
is
the
poor
Beauty
,
a
widow
*NL*
with
a
little
girl
;
here
,
at
dinner
on
Sophy
's
birthday
,
are
the
three
*NL*
married
girls
with
their
three
husbands
,
and
one
of
the
husband
's
*NL*
brothers
,
and
another
husband
's
cousin
,
and
another
husband
's
sister
,
*NL*
who
appears
to
me
to
be
engaged
to
the
cousin
.
Traddles
,
exactly
the
*NL*
same
simple
,
unaffected
fellow
as
he
ever
was
,
sits
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
large
table
like
a
Patriarch
;
and
Sophy
beams
upon
him
,
from
the
head
,
*NL*
across
a
cheerful
space
that
is
certainly
not
glittering
with
Britannia
*NL*
metal
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
as
I
close
my
task
,
subduing
my
desire
to
linger
yet
,
these
*NL*
faces
fade
away
.
But
,
one
face
,
shining
on
me
like
a
Heavenly
light
by
*NL*
which
I
see
all
other
objects
,
is
above
them
and
beyond
them
all
.
And
*NL*
that
remains
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turn
my
head
,
and
see
it
,
in
its
beautiful
serenity
,
beside
me
.
My
*NL*
lamp
burns
low
,
and
I
have
written
far
into
the
night
;
but
the
dear
*NL*
presence
,
without
which
I
were
nothing
,
bears
me
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
Agnes
,
O
my
soul
,
so
may
thy
face
be
by
me
when
I
close
my
life
*NL*
indeed
;
so
may
I
,
when
realities
are
melting
from
me
like
the
shadows
*NL*
which
I
now
dismiss
,
still
find
thee
near
me
,
pointing
upward
!
