TRANSLATOR
'S
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
words
about
Dostoevsky
himself
may
help
the
English
reader
to
*NL*
understand
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dostoevsky
was
the
son
of
a
doctor
.
His
parents
were
very
hard-working
*NL*
and
deeply
religious
people
,
but
so
poor
that
they
lived
with
their
five
*NL*
children
in
only
two
rooms
.
The
father
and
mother
spent
their
evenings
*NL*
in
reading
aloud
to
their
children
,
generally
from
books
of
a
serious
*NL*
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
always
sickly
and
delicate
Dostoevsky
came
out
third
in
the
*NL*
final
examination
of
the
Petersburg
school
of
Engineering
.
There
he
had
*NL*
already
begun
his
first
work
,
``
Poor
Folk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
story
was
published
by
the
poet
Nekrassov
in
his
review
and
*NL*
was
received
with
acclamations
.
The
shy
,
unknown
youth
found
himself
*NL*
instantly
something
of
a
celebrity
.
A
brilliant
and
successful
career
*NL*
seemed
to
open
before
him
,
but
those
hopes
were
soon
dashed
.
In
1849
he
*NL*
was
arrested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
neither
by
temperament
nor
conviction
a
revolutionist
,
Dostoevsky
*NL*
was
one
of
a
little
group
of
young
men
who
met
together
to
read
Fourier
*NL*
and
Proudhon
.
He
was
accused
of
``
taking
part
in
conversations
against
*NL*
the
censorship
,
of
reading
a
letter
from
Byelinsky
to
Gogol
,
and
of
*NL*
knowing
of
the
intention
to
set
up
a
printing
press
.
''
Under
Nicholas
*NL*
I.
-LRB-
that
``
stern
and
just
man
,
''
as
Maurice
Baring
calls
him
-RRB-
this
was
*NL*
enough
,
and
he
was
condemned
to
death
.
After
eight
months
'
imprisonment
*NL*
he
was
with
twenty-one
others
taken
out
to
the
Semyonovsky
Square
to
*NL*
be
shot
.
Writing
to
his
brother
Mihail
,
Dostoevsky
says
:
``
They
snapped
*NL*
words
over
our
heads
,
and
they
made
us
put
on
the
white
shirts
worn
by
*NL*
persons
condemned
to
death
.
Thereupon
we
were
bound
in
threes
to
stakes
,
*NL*
to
suffer
execution
.
Being
the
third
in
the
row
,
I
concluded
I
had
only
*NL*
a
few
minutes
of
life
before
me
.
I
thought
of
you
and
your
dear
ones
and
*NL*
I
contrived
to
kiss
Plestcheiev
and
Dourov
,
who
were
next
to
me
,
and
to
*NL*
bid
them
farewell
.
Suddenly
the
troops
beat
a
tattoo
,
we
were
unbound
,
*NL*
brought
back
upon
the
scaffold
,
and
informed
that
his
Majesty
had
spared
*NL*
us
our
lives
.
''
The
sentence
was
commuted
to
hard
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
prisoners
,
Grigoryev
,
went
mad
as
soon
as
he
was
untied
,
and
*NL*
never
regained
his
sanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intense
suffering
of
this
experience
left
a
lasting
stamp
on
*NL*
Dostoevsky
's
mind
.
Though
his
religious
temper
led
him
in
the
end
to
*NL*
accept
every
suffering
with
resignation
and
to
regard
it
as
a
blessing
*NL*
in
his
own
case
,
he
constantly
recurs
to
the
subject
in
his
writings
.
*NL*
He
describes
the
awful
agony
of
the
condemned
man
and
insists
on
the
*NL*
cruelty
of
inflicting
such
torture
.
Then
followed
four
years
of
penal
*NL*
servitude
,
spent
in
the
company
of
common
criminals
in
Siberia
,
where
*NL*
he
began
the
``
Dead
House
,
''
and
some
years
of
service
in
a
disciplinary
*NL*
battalion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
shown
signs
of
some
obscure
nervous
disease
before
his
arrest
*NL*
and
this
now
developed
into
violent
attacks
of
epilepsy
,
from
which
he
*NL*
suffered
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
The
fits
occurred
three
or
four
times
*NL*
a
year
and
were
more
frequent
in
periods
of
great
strain
.
In
1859
he
was
*NL*
allowed
to
return
to
Russia
.
He
started
a
journal
--
``
Vremya
,
''
which
was
*NL*
forbidden
by
the
Censorship
through
a
misunderstanding
.
In
1864
he
lost
*NL*
his
first
wife
and
his
brother
Mihail
.
He
was
in
terrible
poverty
,
yet
*NL*
he
took
upon
himself
the
payment
of
his
brother
's
debts
.
He
started
*NL*
another
journal
--
``
The
Epoch
,
''
which
within
a
few
months
was
also
*NL*
prohibited
.
He
was
weighed
down
by
debt
,
his
brother
's
family
was
*NL*
dependent
on
him
,
he
was
forced
to
write
at
heart-breaking
speed
,
and
is
*NL*
said
never
to
have
corrected
his
work
.
The
later
years
of
his
life
were
*NL*
much
softened
by
the
tenderness
and
devotion
of
his
second
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
June
1880
he
made
his
famous
speech
at
the
unveiling
of
the
*NL*
monument
to
Pushkin
in
Moscow
and
he
was
received
with
extraordinary
*NL*
demonstrations
of
love
and
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
months
later
Dostoevsky
died
.
He
was
followed
to
the
grave
by
a
*NL*
vast
multitude
of
mourners
,
who
``
gave
the
hapless
man
the
funeral
of
a
*NL*
king
.
''
He
is
still
probably
the
most
widely
read
writer
in
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
words
of
a
Russian
critic
,
who
seeks
to
explain
the
feeling
*NL*
inspired
by
Dostoevsky
:
``
He
was
one
of
ourselves
,
a
man
of
our
blood
and
*NL*
our
bone
,
but
one
who
has
suffered
and
has
seen
so
much
more
deeply
than
*NL*
we
have
his
insight
impresses
us
as
wisdom
...
that
wisdom
of
the
heart
*NL*
which
we
seek
that
we
may
learn
from
it
how
to
live
.
All
his
other
*NL*
gifts
came
to
him
from
nature
,
this
he
won
for
himself
and
through
it
he
*NL*
became
great
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
exceptionally
hot
evening
early
in
July
a
young
man
came
out
of
*NL*
the
garret
in
which
he
lodged
in
S.
Place
and
walked
slowly
,
as
though
*NL*
in
hesitation
,
towards
K.
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
successfully
avoided
meeting
his
landlady
on
the
staircase
.
His
*NL*
garret
was
under
the
roof
of
a
high
,
five-storied
house
and
was
more
*NL*
like
a
cupboard
than
a
room
.
The
landlady
who
provided
him
with
garret
,
*NL*
dinners
,
and
attendance
,
lived
on
the
floor
below
,
and
every
time
*NL*
he
went
out
he
was
obliged
to
pass
her
kitchen
,
the
door
of
which
*NL*
invariably
stood
open
.
And
each
time
he
passed
,
the
young
man
had
a
*NL*
sick
,
frightened
feeling
,
which
made
him
scowl
and
feel
ashamed
.
He
was
*NL*
hopelessly
in
debt
to
his
landlady
,
and
was
afraid
of
meeting
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
because
he
was
cowardly
and
abject
,
quite
the
contrary
;
but
*NL*
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
in
an
overstrained
irritable
condition
,
*NL*
verging
on
hypochondria
.
He
had
become
so
completely
absorbed
in
*NL*
himself
,
and
isolated
from
his
fellows
that
he
dreaded
meeting
,
not
*NL*
only
his
landlady
,
but
anyone
at
all
.
He
was
crushed
by
poverty
,
but
the
*NL*
anxieties
of
his
position
had
of
late
ceased
to
weigh
upon
him
.
He
had
*NL*
given
up
attending
to
matters
of
practical
importance
;
he
had
lost
all
*NL*
desire
to
do
so
.
Nothing
that
any
landlady
could
do
had
a
real
terror
*NL*
for
him
.
But
to
be
stopped
on
the
stairs
,
to
be
forced
to
listen
to
her
*NL*
trivial
,
irrelevant
gossip
,
to
pestering
demands
for
payment
,
threats
*NL*
and
complaints
,
and
to
rack
his
brains
for
excuses
,
to
prevaricate
,
to
*NL*
lie
--
no
,
rather
than
that
,
he
would
creep
down
the
stairs
like
a
cat
and
*NL*
slip
out
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
,
however
,
on
coming
out
into
the
street
,
he
became
acutely
*NL*
aware
of
his
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
attempt
a
thing
_
like
that
_
and
am
frightened
by
these
*NL*
trifles
,
''
he
thought
,
with
an
odd
smile
.
``
Hm
...
yes
,
all
is
in
a
man
's
*NL*
hands
and
he
lets
it
all
slip
from
cowardice
,
that
's
an
axiom
.
It
would
*NL*
be
interesting
to
know
what
it
is
men
are
most
afraid
of
.
Taking
a
new
*NL*
step
,
uttering
a
new
word
is
what
they
fear
most
...
But
I
am
talking
*NL*
too
much
.
It
's
because
I
chatter
that
I
do
nothing
.
Or
perhaps
it
is
*NL*
that
I
chatter
because
I
do
nothing
.
I
've
learned
to
chatter
this
*NL*
last
month
,
lying
for
days
together
in
my
den
thinking
...
of
Jack
the
*NL*
Giant-killer
.
Why
am
I
going
there
now
?
Am
I
capable
of
_
that
_
?
Is
*NL*
_
that
_
serious
?
It
is
not
serious
at
all
.
It
's
simply
a
fantasy
to
amuse
*NL*
myself
;
a
plaything
!
Yes
,
maybe
it
is
a
plaything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
heat
in
the
street
was
terrible
:
and
the
airlessness
,
the
bustle
*NL*
and
the
plaster
,
scaffolding
,
bricks
,
and
dust
all
about
him
,
and
that
*NL*
special
Petersburg
stench
,
so
familiar
to
all
who
are
unable
to
get
out
*NL*
of
town
in
summer
--
all
worked
painfully
upon
the
young
man
's
already
*NL*
overwrought
nerves
.
The
insufferable
stench
from
the
pot-houses
,
which
*NL*
are
particularly
numerous
in
that
part
of
the
town
,
and
the
drunken
men
*NL*
whom
he
met
continually
,
although
it
was
a
working
day
,
completed
*NL*
the
revolting
misery
of
the
picture
.
An
expression
of
the
profoundest
*NL*
disgust
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
the
young
man
's
refined
face
.
He
was
,
*NL*
by
the
way
,
exceptionally
handsome
,
above
the
average
in
height
,
slim
,
*NL*
well-built
,
with
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
dark
brown
hair
.
Soon
he
sank
*NL*
into
deep
thought
,
or
more
accurately
speaking
into
a
complete
blankness
*NL*
of
mind
;
he
walked
along
not
observing
what
was
about
him
and
not
caring
*NL*
to
observe
it
.
From
time
to
time
,
he
would
mutter
something
,
from
the
*NL*
habit
of
talking
to
himself
,
to
which
he
had
just
confessed
.
At
these
*NL*
moments
he
would
become
conscious
that
his
ideas
were
sometimes
in
a
*NL*
tangle
and
that
he
was
very
weak
;
for
two
days
he
had
scarcely
tasted
*NL*
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
badly
dressed
that
even
a
man
accustomed
to
shabbiness
would
*NL*
have
been
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
in
such
rags
.
In
that
quarter
*NL*
of
the
town
,
however
,
scarcely
any
shortcoming
in
dress
would
have
*NL*
created
surprise
.
Owing
to
the
proximity
of
the
Hay
Market
,
the
number
*NL*
of
establishments
of
bad
character
,
the
preponderance
of
the
trading
*NL*
and
working
class
population
crowded
in
these
streets
and
alleys
in
the
*NL*
heart
of
Petersburg
,
types
so
various
were
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
*NL*
that
no
figure
,
however
queer
,
would
have
caused
surprise
.
But
there
was
*NL*
such
accumulated
bitterness
and
contempt
in
the
young
man
's
heart
,
that
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
all
the
fastidiousness
of
youth
,
he
minded
his
rags
least
*NL*
of
all
in
the
street
.
It
was
a
different
matter
when
he
met
with
*NL*
acquaintances
or
with
former
fellow
students
,
whom
,
indeed
,
he
disliked
*NL*
meeting
at
any
time
.
And
yet
when
a
drunken
man
who
,
for
some
unknown
*NL*
reason
,
was
being
taken
somewhere
in
a
huge
waggon
dragged
by
a
heavy
*NL*
dray
horse
,
suddenly
shouted
at
him
as
he
drove
past
:
``
Hey
there
,
German
*NL*
hatter
''
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
pointing
at
him
--
the
young
*NL*
man
stopped
suddenly
and
clutched
tremulously
at
his
hat
.
It
was
a
tall
*NL*
round
hat
from
Zimmerman
's
,
but
completely
worn
out
,
rusty
with
age
,
all
*NL*
torn
and
bespattered
,
brimless
and
bent
on
one
side
in
a
most
unseemly
*NL*
fashion
.
Not
shame
,
however
,
but
quite
another
feeling
akin
to
terror
*NL*
had
overtaken
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
,
''
he
muttered
in
confusion
,
``
I
thought
so
!
That
's
the
worst
*NL*
of
all
!
Why
,
a
stupid
thing
like
this
,
the
most
trivial
detail
might
*NL*
spoil
the
whole
plan
.
Yes
,
my
hat
is
too
noticeable
...
It
looks
absurd
*NL*
and
that
makes
it
noticeable
...
With
my
rags
I
ought
to
wear
a
cap
,
any
*NL*
sort
of
old
pancake
,
but
not
this
grotesque
thing
.
Nobody
wears
such
*NL*
a
hat
,
it
would
be
noticed
a
mile
off
,
it
would
be
remembered
...
What
*NL*
matters
is
that
people
would
remember
it
,
and
that
would
give
them
*NL*
a
clue
.
For
this
business
one
should
be
as
little
conspicuous
as
*NL*
possible
...
Trifles
,
trifles
are
what
matter
!
Why
,
it
's
just
such
*NL*
trifles
that
always
ruin
everything
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
far
to
go
;
he
knew
indeed
how
many
steps
it
was
from
the
gate
*NL*
of
his
lodging
house
:
exactly
seven
hundred
and
thirty
.
He
had
counted
*NL*
them
once
when
he
had
been
lost
in
dreams
.
At
the
time
he
had
put
no
*NL*
faith
in
those
dreams
and
was
only
tantalising
himself
by
their
hideous
*NL*
but
daring
recklessness
.
Now
,
a
month
later
,
he
had
begun
to
look
upon
*NL*
them
differently
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
monologues
in
which
he
jeered
at
*NL*
his
own
impotence
and
indecision
,
he
had
involuntarily
come
to
regard
*NL*
this
``
hideous
''
dream
as
an
exploit
to
be
attempted
,
although
he
*NL*
still
did
not
realise
this
himself
.
He
was
positively
going
now
for
a
*NL*
``
rehearsal
''
of
his
project
,
and
at
every
step
his
excitement
grew
more
*NL*
and
more
violent
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
sinking
heart
and
a
nervous
tremor
,
he
went
up
to
a
huge
house
*NL*
which
on
one
side
looked
on
to
the
canal
,
and
on
the
other
into
the
*NL*
street
.
This
house
was
let
out
in
tiny
tenements
and
was
inhabited
by
*NL*
working
people
of
all
kinds
--
tailors
,
locksmiths
,
cooks
,
Germans
of
*NL*
sorts
,
girls
picking
up
a
living
as
best
they
could
,
petty
clerks
,
etc.
.
*NL*
There
was
a
continual
coming
and
going
through
the
two
gates
and
in
the
*NL*
two
courtyards
of
the
house
.
Three
or
four
door-keepers
were
employed
on
*NL*
the
building
.
The
young
man
was
very
glad
to
meet
none
of
them
,
and
*NL*
at
once
slipped
unnoticed
through
the
door
on
the
right
,
and
up
the
*NL*
staircase
.
It
was
a
back
staircase
,
dark
and
narrow
,
but
he
was
familiar
*NL*
with
it
already
,
and
knew
his
way
,
and
he
liked
all
these
surroundings
:
*NL*
in
such
darkness
even
the
most
inquisitive
eyes
were
not
to
be
dreaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
so
scared
now
,
what
would
it
be
if
it
somehow
came
to
pass
that
*NL*
I
were
really
going
to
do
it
?
''
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
as
he
*NL*
reached
the
fourth
storey
.
There
his
progress
was
barred
by
some
porters
*NL*
who
were
engaged
in
moving
furniture
out
of
a
flat
.
He
knew
that
the
*NL*
flat
had
been
occupied
by
a
German
clerk
in
the
civil
service
,
and
his
*NL*
family
.
This
German
was
moving
out
then
,
and
so
the
fourth
floor
on
this
*NL*
staircase
would
be
untenanted
except
by
the
old
woman
.
``
That
's
a
good
*NL*
thing
anyway
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
as
he
rang
the
bell
of
the
old
*NL*
woman
's
flat
.
The
bell
gave
a
faint
tinkle
as
though
it
were
made
of
*NL*
tin
and
not
of
copper
.
The
little
flats
in
such
houses
always
have
bells
*NL*
that
ring
like
that
.
He
had
forgotten
the
note
of
that
bell
,
and
now
*NL*
its
peculiar
tinkle
seemed
to
remind
him
of
something
and
to
bring
it
*NL*
clearly
before
him
...
He
started
,
his
nerves
were
terribly
overstrained
*NL*
by
now
.
In
a
little
while
,
the
door
was
opened
a
tiny
crack
:
the
old
*NL*
woman
eyed
her
visitor
with
evident
distrust
through
the
crack
,
and
*NL*
nothing
could
be
seen
but
her
little
eyes
,
glittering
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
But
,
seeing
a
number
of
people
on
the
landing
,
she
grew
bolder
,
and
*NL*
opened
the
door
wide
.
The
young
man
stepped
into
the
dark
entry
,
which
*NL*
was
partitioned
off
from
the
tiny
kitchen
.
The
old
woman
stood
facing
*NL*
him
in
silence
and
looking
inquiringly
at
him
.
She
was
a
diminutive
,
*NL*
withered
up
old
woman
of
sixty
,
with
sharp
malignant
eyes
and
a
sharp
*NL*
little
nose
.
Her
colourless
,
somewhat
grizzled
hair
was
thickly
smeared
*NL*
with
oil
,
and
she
wore
no
kerchief
over
it
.
Round
her
thin
long
neck
,
*NL*
which
looked
like
a
hen
's
leg
,
was
knotted
some
sort
of
flannel
rag
,
*NL*
and
,
in
spite
of
the
heat
,
there
hung
flapping
on
her
shoulders
,
a
mangy
*NL*
fur
cape
,
yellow
with
age
.
The
old
woman
coughed
and
groaned
at
every
*NL*
instant
.
The
young
man
must
have
looked
at
her
with
a
rather
peculiar
*NL*
expression
,
for
a
gleam
of
mistrust
came
into
her
eyes
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Raskolnikov
,
a
student
,
I
came
here
a
month
ago
,
''
the
young
man
made
*NL*
haste
to
mutter
,
with
a
half
bow
,
remembering
that
he
ought
to
be
more
*NL*
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
my
good
sir
,
I
remember
quite
well
your
coming
here
,
''
the
*NL*
old
woman
said
distinctly
,
still
keeping
her
inquiring
eyes
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
...
I
am
again
on
the
same
errand
,
''
Raskolnikov
continued
,
a
*NL*
little
disconcerted
and
surprised
at
the
old
woman
's
mistrust
.
``
Perhaps
*NL*
she
is
always
like
that
though
,
only
I
did
not
notice
it
the
other
*NL*
time
,
''
he
thought
with
an
uneasy
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
paused
,
as
though
hesitating
;
then
stepped
on
one
side
,
*NL*
and
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
room
,
she
said
,
letting
her
visitor
pass
*NL*
in
front
of
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Step
in
,
my
good
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
room
into
which
the
young
man
walked
,
with
yellow
paper
on
*NL*
the
walls
,
geraniums
and
muslin
curtains
in
the
windows
,
was
brightly
*NL*
lighted
up
at
that
moment
by
the
setting
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
sun
will
shine
like
this
_
then
_
too
!
''
flashed
as
it
were
by
*NL*
chance
through
Raskolnikov
's
mind
,
and
with
a
rapid
glance
he
scanned
*NL*
everything
in
the
room
,
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
notice
and
*NL*
remember
its
arrangement
.
But
there
was
nothing
special
in
the
room
.
The
*NL*
furniture
,
all
very
old
and
of
yellow
wood
,
consisted
of
a
sofa
with
*NL*
a
huge
bent
wooden
back
,
an
oval
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
,
a
*NL*
dressing-table
with
a
looking-glass
fixed
on
it
between
the
windows
,
*NL*
chairs
along
the
walls
and
two
or
three
half-penny
prints
in
yellow
*NL*
frames
,
representing
German
damsels
with
birds
in
their
hands
--
that
was
*NL*
all
.
In
the
corner
a
light
was
burning
before
a
small
ikon
.
Everything
*NL*
was
very
clean
;
the
floor
and
the
furniture
were
brightly
polished
;
*NL*
everything
shone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizaveta
's
work
,
''
thought
the
young
man
.
There
was
not
a
speck
of
dust
*NL*
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
the
houses
of
spiteful
old
widows
that
one
finds
such
*NL*
cleanliness
,
''
Raskolnikov
thought
again
,
and
he
stole
a
curious
glance
*NL*
at
the
cotton
curtain
over
the
door
leading
into
another
tiny
room
,
in
*NL*
which
stood
the
old
woman
's
bed
and
chest
of
drawers
and
into
which
he
*NL*
had
never
looked
before
.
These
two
rooms
made
up
the
whole
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
the
old
woman
said
severely
,
coming
into
the
room
*NL*
and
,
as
before
,
standing
in
front
of
him
so
as
to
look
him
straight
in
*NL*
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
something
to
pawn
here
,
''
and
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
*NL*
an
old-fashioned
flat
silver
watch
,
on
the
back
of
which
was
engraved
a
*NL*
globe
;
the
chain
was
of
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
time
is
up
for
your
last
pledge
.
The
month
was
up
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
bring
you
the
interest
for
another
month
;
wait
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
for
me
to
do
as
I
please
,
my
good
sir
,
to
wait
or
to
sell
*NL*
your
pledge
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
will
you
give
me
for
the
watch
,
Alyona
Ivanovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
with
such
trifles
,
my
good
sir
,
it
's
scarcely
worth
anything
.
*NL*
I
gave
you
two
roubles
last
time
for
your
ring
and
one
could
buy
it
*NL*
quite
new
at
a
jeweler
's
for
a
rouble
and
a
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
four
roubles
for
it
,
I
shall
redeem
it
,
it
was
my
father
's
.
I
*NL*
shall
be
getting
some
money
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rouble
and
a
half
,
and
interest
in
advance
,
if
you
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rouble
and
a
half
!
''
cried
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
yourself
''
--
and
the
old
woman
handed
him
back
the
watch
.
The
*NL*
young
man
took
it
,
and
was
so
angry
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
*NL*
away
;
but
checked
himself
at
once
,
remembering
that
there
was
nowhere
*NL*
else
he
could
go
,
and
that
he
had
had
another
object
also
in
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hand
it
over
,
''
he
said
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
her
keys
,
and
disappeared
behind
*NL*
the
curtain
into
the
other
room
.
The
young
man
,
left
standing
alone
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
room
,
listened
inquisitively
,
thinking
.
He
could
hear
*NL*
her
unlocking
the
chest
of
drawers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
the
top
drawer
,
''
he
reflected
.
``
So
she
carries
the
keys
in
*NL*
a
pocket
on
the
right
.
All
in
one
bunch
on
a
steel
ring
...
And
there
's
*NL*
one
key
there
,
three
times
as
big
as
all
the
others
,
with
deep
notches
;
*NL*
that
ca
n't
be
the
key
of
the
chest
of
drawers
...
then
there
must
be
some
*NL*
other
chest
or
strong-box
...
that
's
worth
knowing
.
Strong-boxes
always
*NL*
have
keys
like
that
...
but
how
degrading
it
all
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
sir
:
as
we
say
ten
copecks
the
rouble
a
month
,
so
I
must
take
*NL*
fifteen
copecks
from
a
rouble
and
a
half
for
the
month
in
advance
.
But
*NL*
for
the
two
roubles
I
lent
you
before
,
you
owe
me
now
twenty
copecks
*NL*
on
the
same
reckoning
in
advance
.
That
makes
thirty-five
copecks
*NL*
altogether
.
So
I
must
give
you
a
rouble
and
fifteen
copecks
for
the
*NL*
watch
.
Here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
only
a
rouble
and
fifteen
copecks
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
did
not
dispute
it
and
took
the
money
.
He
looked
at
the
*NL*
old
woman
,
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
get
away
,
as
though
there
was
still
*NL*
something
he
wanted
to
say
or
to
do
,
but
he
did
not
himself
quite
know
*NL*
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
be
bringing
you
something
else
in
a
day
or
two
,
Alyona
*NL*
Ivanovna
--
a
valuable
thing
--
silver
--
a
cigarette-box
,
as
soon
as
I
get
it
*NL*
back
from
a
friend
...
''
he
broke
off
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
will
talk
about
it
then
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
--
are
you
always
at
home
alone
,
your
sister
is
not
here
with
*NL*
you
?
''
He
asked
her
as
casually
as
possible
as
he
went
out
into
the
*NL*
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
business
is
she
of
yours
,
my
good
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
particular
,
I
simply
asked
.
You
are
too
quick
...
Good-day
,
*NL*
Alyona
Ivanovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
out
in
complete
confusion
.
This
confusion
became
more
*NL*
and
more
intense
.
As
he
went
down
the
stairs
,
he
even
stopped
short
,
two
*NL*
or
three
times
,
as
though
suddenly
struck
by
some
thought
.
When
he
was
*NL*
in
the
street
he
cried
out
,
``
Oh
,
God
,
how
loathsome
it
all
is
!
and
*NL*
can
I
,
can
I
possibly
...
No
,
it
's
nonsense
,
it
's
rubbish
!
''
he
added
*NL*
resolutely
.
``
And
how
could
such
an
atrocious
thing
come
into
my
head
?
*NL*
What
filthy
things
my
heart
is
capable
of
.
Yes
,
filthy
above
all
,
*NL*
disgusting
,
loathsome
,
loathsome
!
--
and
for
a
whole
month
I
've
been
...
''
*NL*
But
no
words
,
no
exclamations
,
could
express
his
agitation
.
The
feeling
*NL*
of
intense
repulsion
,
which
had
begun
to
oppress
and
torture
his
heart
*NL*
while
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
old
woman
,
had
by
now
reached
such
a
*NL*
pitch
and
had
taken
such
a
definite
form
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
*NL*
do
with
himself
to
escape
from
his
wretchedness
.
He
walked
along
the
*NL*
pavement
like
a
drunken
man
,
regardless
of
the
passers-by
,
and
jostling
*NL*
against
them
,
and
only
came
to
his
senses
when
he
was
in
the
next
*NL*
street
.
Looking
round
,
he
noticed
that
he
was
standing
close
to
a
tavern
*NL*
which
was
entered
by
steps
leading
from
the
pavement
to
the
basement
.
*NL*
At
that
instant
two
drunken
men
came
out
at
the
door
,
and
abusing
and
*NL*
supporting
one
another
,
they
mounted
the
steps
.
Without
stopping
to
*NL*
think
,
Raskolnikov
went
down
the
steps
at
once
.
Till
that
moment
he
had
*NL*
never
been
into
a
tavern
,
but
now
he
felt
giddy
and
was
tormented
by
a
*NL*
burning
thirst
.
He
longed
for
a
drink
of
cold
beer
,
and
attributed
his
*NL*
sudden
weakness
to
the
want
of
food
.
He
sat
down
at
a
sticky
little
*NL*
table
in
a
dark
and
dirty
corner
;
ordered
some
beer
,
and
eagerly
drank
*NL*
off
the
first
glassful
.
At
once
he
felt
easier
;
and
his
thoughts
became
*NL*
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
's
nonsense
,
''
he
said
hopefully
,
``
and
there
is
nothing
in
it
*NL*
all
to
worry
about
!
It
's
simply
physical
derangement
.
Just
a
glass
of
*NL*
beer
,
a
piece
of
dry
bread
--
and
in
one
moment
the
brain
is
stronger
,
*NL*
the
mind
is
clearer
and
the
will
is
firm
!
Phew
,
how
utterly
petty
it
all
*NL*
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
this
scornful
reflection
,
he
was
by
now
looking
cheerful
*NL*
as
though
he
were
suddenly
set
free
from
a
terrible
burden
:
and
he
gazed
*NL*
round
in
a
friendly
way
at
the
people
in
the
room
.
But
even
at
that
*NL*
moment
he
had
a
dim
foreboding
that
this
happier
frame
of
mind
was
also
*NL*
not
normal
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
few
people
at
the
time
in
the
tavern
.
Besides
the
two
drunken
*NL*
men
he
had
met
on
the
steps
,
a
group
consisting
of
about
five
men
and
*NL*
a
girl
with
a
concertina
had
gone
out
at
the
same
time
.
Their
departure
*NL*
left
the
room
quiet
and
rather
empty
.
The
persons
still
in
the
tavern
*NL*
were
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
an
artisan
,
drunk
,
but
not
extremely
so
,
*NL*
sitting
before
a
pot
of
beer
,
and
his
companion
,
a
huge
,
stout
man
with
*NL*
a
grey
beard
,
in
a
short
full-skirted
coat
.
He
was
very
drunk
:
and
had
*NL*
dropped
asleep
on
the
bench
;
every
now
and
then
,
he
began
as
though
in
*NL*
his
sleep
,
cracking
his
fingers
,
with
his
arms
wide
apart
and
the
upper
*NL*
part
of
his
body
bounding
about
on
the
bench
,
while
he
hummed
some
*NL*
meaningless
refrain
,
trying
to
recall
some
such
lines
as
these
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
wife
a
year
he
fondly
loved
*NL*
His
wife
a
--
a
year
he
--
fondly
loved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Or
suddenly
waking
up
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walking
along
the
crowded
row
*NL*
He
met
the
one
he
used
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
one
shared
his
enjoyment
:
his
silent
companion
looked
with
*NL*
positive
hostility
and
mistrust
at
all
these
manifestations
.
There
was
*NL*
another
man
in
the
room
who
looked
somewhat
like
a
retired
government
*NL*
clerk
.
He
was
sitting
apart
,
now
and
then
sipping
from
his
pot
and
*NL*
looking
round
at
the
company
.
He
,
too
,
appeared
to
be
in
some
agitation
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
not
used
to
crowds
,
and
,
as
we
said
before
,
he
avoided
*NL*
society
of
every
sort
,
more
especially
of
late
.
But
now
all
at
once
he
*NL*
felt
a
desire
to
be
with
other
people
.
Something
new
seemed
to
be
taking
*NL*
place
within
him
,
and
with
it
he
felt
a
sort
of
thirst
for
company
.
He
*NL*
was
so
weary
after
a
whole
month
of
concentrated
wretchedness
and
gloomy
*NL*
excitement
that
he
longed
to
rest
,
if
only
for
a
moment
,
in
some
other
*NL*
world
,
whatever
it
might
be
;
and
,
in
spite
of
the
filthiness
of
the
*NL*
surroundings
,
he
was
glad
now
to
stay
in
the
tavern
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
the
establishment
was
in
another
room
,
but
he
frequently
*NL*
came
down
some
steps
into
the
main
room
,
his
jaunty
,
tarred
boots
with
*NL*
red
turn-over
tops
coming
into
view
each
time
before
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
person
.
He
wore
a
full
coat
and
a
horribly
greasy
black
satin
waistcoat
,
*NL*
with
no
cravat
,
and
his
whole
face
seemed
smeared
with
oil
like
an
*NL*
iron
lock
.
At
the
counter
stood
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
,
and
there
was
*NL*
another
boy
somewhat
younger
who
handed
whatever
was
wanted
.
On
the
*NL*
counter
lay
some
sliced
cucumber
,
some
pieces
of
dried
black
bread
,
and
*NL*
some
fish
,
chopped
up
small
,
all
smelling
very
bad
.
It
was
insufferably
*NL*
close
,
and
so
heavy
with
the
fumes
of
spirits
that
five
minutes
in
such
*NL*
an
atmosphere
might
well
make
a
man
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
chance
meetings
with
strangers
that
interest
us
from
the
*NL*
first
moment
,
before
a
word
is
spoken
.
Such
was
the
impression
made
on
*NL*
Raskolnikov
by
the
person
sitting
a
little
distance
from
him
,
who
looked
*NL*
like
a
retired
clerk
.
The
young
man
often
recalled
this
impression
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
even
ascribed
it
to
presentiment
.
He
looked
repeatedly
*NL*
at
the
clerk
,
partly
no
doubt
because
the
latter
was
staring
*NL*
persistently
at
him
,
obviously
anxious
to
enter
into
conversation
.
At
*NL*
the
other
persons
in
the
room
,
including
the
tavern-keeper
,
the
clerk
*NL*
looked
as
though
he
were
used
to
their
company
,
and
weary
of
it
,
showing
*NL*
a
shade
of
condescending
contempt
for
them
as
persons
of
station
and
*NL*
culture
inferior
to
his
own
,
with
whom
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
*NL*
converse
.
He
was
a
man
over
fifty
,
bald
and
grizzled
,
of
medium
height
,
*NL*
and
stoutly
built
.
His
face
,
bloated
from
continual
drinking
,
was
of
*NL*
a
yellow
,
even
greenish
,
tinge
,
with
swollen
eyelids
out
of
which
keen
*NL*
reddish
eyes
gleamed
like
little
chinks
.
But
there
was
something
very
*NL*
strange
in
him
;
there
was
a
light
in
his
eyes
as
though
of
intense
*NL*
feeling
--
perhaps
there
were
even
thought
and
intelligence
,
but
at
the
*NL*
same
time
there
was
a
gleam
of
something
like
madness
.
He
was
wearing
an
*NL*
old
and
hopelessly
ragged
black
dress
coat
,
with
all
its
buttons
missing
*NL*
except
one
,
and
that
one
he
had
buttoned
,
evidently
clinging
to
this
*NL*
last
trace
of
respectability
.
A
crumpled
shirt
front
,
covered
with
spots
*NL*
and
stains
,
protruded
from
his
canvas
waistcoat
.
Like
a
clerk
,
he
wore
*NL*
no
beard
,
nor
moustache
,
but
had
been
so
long
unshaven
that
his
chin
*NL*
looked
like
a
stiff
greyish
brush
.
And
there
was
something
respectable
*NL*
and
like
an
official
about
his
manner
too
.
But
he
was
restless
;
he
*NL*
ruffled
up
his
hair
and
from
time
to
time
let
his
head
drop
into
his
*NL*
hands
dejectedly
resting
his
ragged
elbows
on
the
stained
and
sticky
*NL*
table
.
At
last
he
looked
straight
at
Raskolnikov
,
and
said
loudly
and
*NL*
resolutely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
venture
,
honoured
sir
,
to
engage
you
in
polite
conversation
?
*NL*
Forasmuch
as
,
though
your
exterior
would
not
command
respect
,
my
*NL*
experience
admonishes
me
that
you
are
a
man
of
education
and
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
drinking
.
I
have
always
respected
education
when
in
*NL*
conjunction
with
genuine
sentiments
,
and
I
am
besides
a
titular
*NL*
counsellor
in
rank
.
Marmeladov
--
such
is
my
name
;
titular
counsellor
.
I
*NL*
make
bold
to
inquire
--
have
you
been
in
the
service
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
studying
,
''
answered
the
young
man
,
somewhat
surprised
at
*NL*
the
grandiloquent
style
of
the
speaker
and
also
at
being
so
directly
*NL*
addressed
.
In
spite
of
the
momentary
desire
he
had
just
been
feeling
for
*NL*
company
of
any
sort
,
on
being
actually
spoken
to
he
felt
immediately
his
*NL*
habitual
irritable
and
uneasy
aversion
for
any
stranger
who
approached
*NL*
or
attempted
to
approach
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
student
then
,
or
formerly
a
student
,
''
cried
the
clerk
.
``
Just
what
*NL*
I
thought
!
I
'm
a
man
of
experience
,
immense
experience
,
sir
,
''
and
he
*NL*
tapped
his
forehead
with
his
fingers
in
self-approval
.
``
You
've
been
a
*NL*
student
or
have
attended
some
learned
institution
!
...
But
allow
me
...
''
*NL*
He
got
up
,
staggered
,
took
up
his
jug
and
glass
,
and
sat
down
beside
*NL*
the
young
man
,
facing
him
a
little
sideways
.
He
was
drunk
,
but
spoke
*NL*
fluently
and
boldly
,
only
occasionally
losing
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
sentences
and
drawling
his
words
.
He
pounced
upon
Raskolnikov
as
*NL*
greedily
as
though
he
too
had
not
spoken
to
a
soul
for
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honoured
sir
,
''
he
began
almost
with
solemnity
,
``
poverty
is
not
a
vice
,
*NL*
that
's
a
true
saying
.
Yet
I
know
too
that
drunkenness
is
not
a
virtue
,
*NL*
and
that
that
's
even
truer
.
But
beggary
,
honoured
sir
,
beggary
is
a
*NL*
vice
.
In
poverty
you
may
still
retain
your
innate
nobility
of
soul
,
but
*NL*
in
beggary
--
never
--
no
one
.
For
beggary
a
man
is
not
chased
out
of
human
*NL*
society
with
a
stick
,
he
is
swept
out
with
a
broom
,
so
as
to
make
it
as
*NL*
humiliating
as
possible
;
and
quite
right
,
too
,
forasmuch
as
in
beggary
*NL*
I
am
ready
to
be
the
first
to
humiliate
myself
.
Hence
the
pot-house
!
*NL*
Honoured
sir
,
a
month
ago
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
gave
my
wife
a
beating
,
and
*NL*
my
wife
is
a
very
different
matter
from
me
!
Do
you
understand
?
Allow
me
*NL*
to
ask
you
another
question
out
of
simple
curiosity
:
have
you
ever
spent
*NL*
a
night
on
a
hay
barge
,
on
the
Neva
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
not
happened
to
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
just
come
from
one
and
it
's
the
fifth
night
I
've
slept
*NL*
so
...
''
He
filled
his
glass
,
emptied
it
and
paused
.
Bits
of
hay
were
in
*NL*
fact
clinging
to
his
clothes
and
sticking
to
his
hair
.
It
seemed
quite
*NL*
probable
that
he
had
not
undressed
or
washed
for
the
last
five
days
.
*NL*
His
hands
,
particularly
,
were
filthy
.
They
were
fat
and
red
,
with
black
*NL*
nails
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
conversation
seemed
to
excite
a
general
though
languid
interest
.
The
*NL*
boys
at
the
counter
fell
to
sniggering
.
The
innkeeper
came
down
from
the
*NL*
upper
room
,
apparently
on
purpose
to
listen
to
the
``
funny
fellow
''
*NL*
and
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
,
yawning
lazily
,
but
with
dignity
.
*NL*
Evidently
Marmeladov
was
a
familiar
figure
here
,
and
he
had
most
*NL*
likely
acquired
his
weakness
for
high-flown
speeches
from
the
habit
of
*NL*
frequently
entering
into
conversation
with
strangers
of
all
sorts
in
*NL*
the
tavern
.
This
habit
develops
into
a
necessity
in
some
drunkards
,
and
*NL*
especially
in
those
who
are
looked
after
sharply
and
kept
in
order
*NL*
at
home
.
Hence
in
the
company
of
other
drinkers
they
try
to
justify
*NL*
themselves
and
even
if
possible
obtain
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Funny
fellow
!
''
pronounced
the
innkeeper
.
``
And
why
do
n't
you
work
,
why
*NL*
are
n't
you
at
your
duty
,
if
you
are
in
the
service
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
am
I
not
at
my
duty
,
honoured
sir
,
''
Marmeladov
went
on
,
addressing
*NL*
himself
exclusively
to
Raskolnikov
,
as
though
it
had
been
he
who
put
*NL*
that
question
to
him
.
``
Why
am
I
not
at
my
duty
?
Does
not
my
heart
ache
*NL*
to
think
what
a
useless
worm
I
am
?
A
month
ago
when
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
*NL*
beat
my
wife
with
his
own
hands
,
and
I
lay
drunk
,
did
n't
I
suffer
?
*NL*
Excuse
me
,
young
man
,
has
it
ever
happened
to
you
...
hm
...
well
,
to
*NL*
petition
hopelessly
for
a
loan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
has
.
But
what
do
you
mean
by
hopelessly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hopelessly
in
the
fullest
sense
,
when
you
know
beforehand
that
you
*NL*
will
get
nothing
by
it
.
You
know
,
for
instance
,
beforehand
with
positive
*NL*
certainty
that
this
man
,
this
most
reputable
and
exemplary
citizen
,
will
*NL*
on
no
consideration
give
you
money
;
and
indeed
I
ask
you
why
should
he
?
*NL*
For
he
knows
of
course
that
I
sha
n't
pay
it
back
.
From
compassion
?
But
*NL*
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
who
keeps
up
with
modern
ideas
explained
the
other
day
*NL*
that
compassion
is
forbidden
nowadays
by
science
itself
,
and
that
that
's
*NL*
what
is
done
now
in
England
,
where
there
is
political
economy
.
Why
,
I
*NL*
ask
you
,
should
he
give
it
to
me
?
And
yet
though
I
know
beforehand
that
*NL*
he
wo
n't
,
I
set
off
to
him
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
go
?
''
put
in
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
one
has
no
one
,
nowhere
else
one
can
go
!
For
every
man
must
*NL*
have
somewhere
to
go
.
Since
there
are
times
when
one
absolutely
must
*NL*
go
somewhere
!
When
my
own
daughter
first
went
out
with
a
yellow
ticket
,
*NL*
then
I
had
to
go
...
-LRB-
for
my
daughter
has
a
yellow
passport
-RRB-
,
''
he
added
*NL*
in
parenthesis
,
looking
with
a
certain
uneasiness
at
the
young
man
.
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
sir
,
no
matter
!
''
he
went
on
hurriedly
and
with
apparent
*NL*
composure
when
both
the
boys
at
the
counter
guffawed
and
even
the
*NL*
innkeeper
smiled
--
``
No
matter
,
I
am
not
confounded
by
the
wagging
of
*NL*
their
heads
;
for
everyone
knows
everything
about
it
already
,
and
all
*NL*
that
is
secret
is
made
open
.
And
I
accept
it
all
,
not
with
contempt
,
but
*NL*
with
humility
.
So
be
it
!
So
be
it
!
`
Behold
the
man
!

Excuse
me
,
young
*NL*
man

can
you
...
No

to
put
it
more
strongly
and
more
distinctly
;
not
*NL*

can
_
you
but
_
dare
_
you
,
looking
upon
me
,
assert
that
I
am
not
a
pig

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
did
not
answer
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
the
orator
began
again
stolidly
and
with
even
increased
dignity
,
*NL*
after
waiting
for
the
laughter
in
the
room
to
subside
.
``
Well
,
so
be
*NL*
it
,
I
am
a

but
she

the
semblance

*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna

of
education

an
officer

he
*NL*
declared
with
redoubled
dignity
,
hearing
the
sniggering
again
--
``

it
's
no
*NL*
use
talking
!
No
use
talking
!
For
more
than
once
,
my
wish
did
come
true
*NL*
and
more
than
once
she
has
felt
for
me
but
...
such
is
my
fate
and
I
am
a
*NL*
beast
by
nature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
!
''
assented
the
innkeeper
yawning
.
Marmeladov
struck
his
fist
*NL*
resolutely
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
my
fate
!
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
do
you
know
,
I
have
sold
her
very
*NL*
stockings
for
drink
?
Not
her
shoes
--
that
would
be
more
or
less
in
the
*NL*
order
of
things
,
but
her
stockings
,
her
stockings
I
have
sold
for
drink
!
*NL*
Her
mohair
shawl
I
sold
for
drink
,
a
present
to
her
long
ago
,
her
own
*NL*
property
,
not
mine
;
and
we
live
in
a
cold
room
and
she
caught
cold
this
*NL*
winter
and
has
begun
coughing
and
spitting
blood
too
.
We
have
three
*NL*
little
children
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
is
at
work
from
morning
till
*NL*
night
;
she
is
scrubbing
and
cleaning
and
washing
the
children
,
for
she
's
*NL*
been
used
to
cleanliness
from
a
child
.
But
her
chest
is
weak
and
she
has
*NL*
a
tendency
to
consumption
and
I
feel
it
!
Do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
feel
it
?
*NL*
And
the
more
I
drink
the
more
I
feel
it
.
That
's
why
I
drink
too
.
I
try
*NL*
to
find
sympathy
and
feeling
in
drink
...
I
drink
so
that
I
may
suffer
*NL*
twice
as
much
!
''
And
as
though
in
despair
he
laid
his
head
down
on
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
''
he
went
on
,
raising
his
head
again
,
``
in
your
face
I
seem
to
*NL*
read
some
trouble
of
mind
.
When
you
came
in
I
read
it
,
and
that
was
why
*NL*
I
addressed
you
at
once
.
For
in
unfolding
to
you
the
story
of
my
life
,
I
*NL*
do
not
wish
to
make
myself
a
laughing-stock
before
these
idle
listeners
,
*NL*
who
indeed
know
all
about
it
already
,
but
I
am
looking
for
a
man
*NL*
of
feeling
and
education
.
Know
then
that
my
wife
was
educated
in
a
*NL*
high-class
school
for
the
daughters
of
noblemen
,
and
on
leaving
she
*NL*
danced
the
shawl
dance
before
the
governor
and
other
personages
for
*NL*
which
she
was
presented
with
a
gold
medal
and
a
certificate
of
merit
.
*NL*
The
medal
...
well
,
the
medal
of
course
was
sold
--
long
ago
,
hm
...
but
the
*NL*
certificate
of
merit
is
in
her
trunk
still
and
not
long
ago
she
showed
*NL*
it
to
our
landlady
.
And
although
she
is
most
continually
on
bad
terms
*NL*
with
the
landlady
,
yet
she
wanted
to
tell
someone
or
other
of
her
past
*NL*
honours
and
of
the
happy
days
that
are
gone
.
I
do
n't
condemn
her
for
*NL*
it
,
I
do
n't
blame
her
,
for
the
one
thing
left
her
is
recollection
of
*NL*
the
past
,
and
all
the
rest
is
dust
and
ashes
.
Yes
,
yes
,
she
is
a
lady
*NL*
of
spirit
,
proud
and
determined
.
She
scrubs
the
floors
herself
and
has
*NL*
nothing
but
black
bread
to
eat
,
but
wo
n't
allow
herself
to
be
treated
*NL*
with
disrespect
.
That
's
why
she
would
not
overlook
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
's
*NL*
rudeness
to
her
,
and
so
when
he
gave
her
a
beating
for
it
,
she
took
to
*NL*
her
bed
more
from
the
hurt
to
her
feelings
than
from
the
blows
.
She
was
*NL*
a
widow
when
I
married
her
,
with
three
children
,
one
smaller
than
the
*NL*
other
.
She
married
her
first
husband
,
an
infantry
officer
,
for
love
,
and
*NL*
ran
away
with
him
from
her
father
's
house
.
She
was
exceedingly
fond
of
*NL*
her
husband
;
but
he
gave
way
to
cards
,
got
into
trouble
and
with
that
he
*NL*
died
.
He
used
to
beat
her
at
the
end
:
and
although
she
paid
him
back
,
of
*NL*
which
I
have
authentic
documentary
evidence
,
to
this
day
she
speaks
of
*NL*
him
with
tears
and
she
throws
him
up
to
me
;
and
I
am
glad
,
I
am
glad
*NL*
that
,
though
only
in
imagination
,
she
should
think
of
herself
as
having
*NL*
once
been
happy
...
And
she
was
left
at
his
death
with
three
children
in
*NL*
a
wild
and
remote
district
where
I
happened
to
be
at
the
time
;
and
she
*NL*
was
left
in
such
hopeless
poverty
that
,
although
I
have
seen
many
ups
*NL*
and
downs
of
all
sort
,
I
do
n't
feel
equal
to
describing
it
even
.
Her
*NL*
relations
had
all
thrown
her
off
.
And
she
was
proud
,
too
,
excessively
*NL*
proud
...
And
then
,
honoured
sir
,
and
then
,
I
,
being
at
the
time
a
*NL*
widower
,
with
a
daughter
of
fourteen
left
me
by
my
first
wife
,
offered
*NL*
her
my
hand
,
for
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
such
suffering
.
You
can
*NL*
judge
the
extremity
of
her
calamities
,
that
she
,
a
woman
of
education
*NL*
and
culture
and
distinguished
family
,
should
have
consented
to
be
my
*NL*
wife
.
But
she
did
!
Weeping
and
sobbing
and
wringing
her
hands
,
she
*NL*
married
me
!
For
she
had
nowhere
to
turn
!
Do
you
understand
,
sir
,
do
you
*NL*
understand
what
it
means
when
you
have
absolutely
nowhere
to
turn
?
No
,
*NL*
that
you
do
n't
understand
yet
...
And
for
a
whole
year
,
I
performed
*NL*
my
duties
conscientiously
and
faithfully
,
and
did
not
touch
this
''
-LRB-
he
*NL*
tapped
the
jug
with
his
finger
-RRB-
,
``
for
I
have
feelings
.
But
even
so
,
I
*NL*
could
not
please
her
;
and
then
I
lost
my
place
too
,
and
that
through
no
*NL*
fault
of
mine
but
through
changes
in
the
office
;
and
then
I
did
touch
*NL*
it
!
...
It
will
be
a
year
and
a
half
ago
soon
since
we
found
ourselves
at
*NL*
last
after
many
wanderings
and
numerous
calamities
in
this
magnificent
*NL*
capital
,
adorned
with
innumerable
monuments
.
Here
I
obtained
a
*NL*
situation
...
I
obtained
it
and
I
lost
it
again
.
Do
you
understand
?
This
*NL*
time
it
was
through
my
own
fault
I
lost
it
:
for
my
weakness
had
come
*NL*
out
...
We
have
now
part
of
a
room
at
Amalia
Fyodorovna
Lippevechsel
's
;
*NL*
and
what
we
live
upon
and
what
we
pay
our
rent
with
,
I
could
not
say
.
*NL*
There
are
a
lot
of
people
living
there
besides
ourselves
.
Dirt
and
*NL*
disorder
,
a
perfect
Bedlam
...
hm
...
yes
...
And
meanwhile
my
daughter
by
*NL*
my
first
wife
has
grown
up
;
and
what
my
daughter
has
had
to
put
up
with
*NL*
from
her
step-mother
whilst
she
was
growing
up
,
I
wo
n't
speak
of
.
For
,
*NL*
though
Katerina
Ivanovna
is
full
of
generous
feelings
,
she
is
a
spirited
*NL*
lady
,
irritable
and
short-tempered
...
Yes
.
But
it
's
no
use
going
over
*NL*
that
!
Sonia
,
as
you
may
well
fancy
,
has
had
no
education
.
I
did
make
an
*NL*
effort
four
years
ago
to
give
her
a
course
of
geography
and
universal
*NL*
history
,
but
as
I
was
not
very
well
up
in
those
subjects
myself
and
we
*NL*
had
no
suitable
books
,
and
what
books
we
had
...
hm
,
anyway
we
have
not
*NL*
even
those
now
,
so
all
our
instruction
came
to
an
end
.
We
stopped
at
*NL*
Cyrus
of
Persia
.
Since
she
has
attained
years
of
maturity
,
she
has
read
*NL*
other
books
of
romantic
tendency
and
of
late
she
had
read
with
great
*NL*
interest
a
book
she
got
through
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
,
Lewes
'
Physiology
--
do
*NL*
you
know
it
?
--
and
even
recounted
extracts
from
it
to
us
:
and
that
's
the
*NL*
whole
of
her
education
.
And
now
may
I
venture
to
address
you
,
honoured
*NL*
sir
,
on
my
own
account
with
a
private
question
.
Do
you
suppose
that
*NL*
a
respectable
poor
girl
can
earn
much
by
honest
work
?
Not
fifteen
*NL*
farthings
a
day
can
she
earn
,
if
she
is
respectable
and
has
no
special
*NL*
talent
and
that
without
putting
her
work
down
for
an
instant
!
And
what
's
*NL*
more
,
Ivan
Ivanitch
Klopstock
the
civil
counsellor
--
have
you
heard
of
*NL*
him
?
--
has
not
to
this
day
paid
her
for
the
half-dozen
linen
shirts
she
*NL*
made
him
and
drove
her
roughly
away
,
stamping
and
reviling
her
,
on
the
*NL*
pretext
that
the
shirt
collars
were
not
made
like
the
pattern
and
were
*NL*
put
in
askew
.
And
there
are
the
little
ones
hungry
...
And
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
walking
up
and
down
and
wringing
her
hands
,
her
cheeks
flushed
*NL*
red
,
as
they
always
are
in
that
disease
:
`
Here
you
live
with
us
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
you
eat
and
drink
and
are
kept
warm
and
you
do
nothing
to
help
.
'
*NL*
And
much
she
gets
to
eat
and
drink
when
there
is
not
a
crust
for
the
*NL*
little
ones
for
three
days
!
I
was
lying
at
the
time
...
well
,
what
of
*NL*
it
!
I
was
lying
drunk
and
I
heard
my
Sonia
speaking
-LRB-
she
is
a
gentle
*NL*
creature
with
a
soft
little
voice
...
fair
hair
and
such
a
pale
,
thin
*NL*
little
face
-RRB-
.
She
said
:
`
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
am
I
really
to
do
a
thing
*NL*
like
that
?
'
And
Darya
Frantsovna
,
a
woman
of
evil
character
and
very
*NL*
well
known
to
the
police
,
had
two
or
three
times
tried
to
get
at
her
*NL*
through
the
landlady
.
`
And
why
not
?
'
said
Katerina
Ivanovna
with
a
jeer
,
*NL*
`
you
are
something
mighty
precious
to
be
so
careful
of
!
'
But
do
n't
blame
*NL*
her
,
do
n't
blame
her
,
honoured
sir
,
do
n't
blame
her
!
She
was
not
herself
*NL*
when
she
spoke
,
but
driven
to
distraction
by
her
illness
and
the
crying
*NL*
of
the
hungry
children
;
and
it
was
said
more
to
wound
her
than
anything
*NL*
else
...
For
that
's
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
character
,
and
when
children
*NL*
cry
,
even
from
hunger
,
she
falls
to
beating
them
at
once
.
At
six
o'clock
*NL*
I
saw
Sonia
get
up
,
put
on
her
kerchief
and
her
cape
,
and
go
out
of
the
*NL*
room
and
about
nine
o'clock
she
came
back
.
She
walked
straight
up
to
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
she
laid
thirty
roubles
on
the
table
before
her
*NL*
in
silence
.
She
did
not
utter
a
word
,
she
did
not
even
look
at
her
,
she
*NL*
simply
picked
up
our
big
green
_
drap
de
dames
_
shawl
-LRB-
we
have
a
shawl
,
*NL*
made
of
_
drap
de
dames
_
-RRB-
,
put
it
over
her
head
and
face
and
lay
down
*NL*
on
the
bed
with
her
face
to
the
wall
;
only
her
little
shoulders
and
her
*NL*
body
kept
shuddering
...
And
I
went
on
lying
there
,
just
as
before
...
*NL*
And
then
I
saw
,
young
man
,
I
saw
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
in
the
same
silence
*NL*
go
up
to
Sonia
's
little
bed
;
she
was
on
her
knees
all
the
evening
*NL*
kissing
Sonia
's
feet
,
and
would
not
get
up
,
and
then
they
both
fell
*NL*
asleep
in
each
other
's
arms
...
together
,
together
...
yes
...
and
I.
.
.
lay
*NL*
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marmeladov
stopped
short
,
as
though
his
voice
had
failed
him
.
Then
he
*NL*
hurriedly
filled
his
glass
,
drank
,
and
cleared
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
then
,
sir
,
''
he
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
--
``
Since
then
,
owing
*NL*
to
an
unfortunate
occurrence
and
through
information
given
by
*NL*
evil-intentioned
persons
--
in
all
which
Darya
Frantsovna
took
a
*NL*
leading
part
on
the
pretext
that
she
had
been
treated
with
want
of
*NL*
respect
--
since
then
my
daughter
Sofya
Semyonovna
has
been
forced
to
take
*NL*
a
yellow
ticket
,
and
owing
to
that
she
is
unable
to
go
on
living
with
*NL*
us
.
For
our
landlady
,
Amalia
Fyodorovna
would
not
hear
of
it
-LRB-
though
*NL*
she
had
backed
up
Darya
Frantsovna
before
-RRB-
and
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
too
...
*NL*
hm
...
All
the
trouble
between
him
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
on
Sonia
's
*NL*
account
.
At
first
he
was
for
making
up
to
Sonia
himself
and
then
all
of
*NL*
a
sudden
he
stood
on
his
dignity
:
`
how
,
'
said
he
,
`
can
a
highly
educated
*NL*
man
like
me
live
in
the
same
rooms
with
a
girl
like
that
?
'
And
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
would
not
let
it
pass
,
she
stood
up
for
her
...
and
so
that
's
*NL*
how
it
happened
.
And
Sonia
comes
to
us
now
,
mostly
after
dark
;
she
*NL*
comforts
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
gives
her
all
she
can
...
She
has
a
room
*NL*
at
the
Kapernaumovs
'
the
tailors
,
she
lodges
with
them
;
Kapernaumov
is
*NL*
a
lame
man
with
a
cleft
palate
and
all
of
his
numerous
family
have
cleft
*NL*
palates
too
.
And
his
wife
,
too
,
has
a
cleft
palate
.
They
all
live
in
one
*NL*
room
,
but
Sonia
has
her
own
,
partitioned
off
...
Hm
...
yes
...
very
poor
*NL*
people
and
all
with
cleft
palates
...
yes
.
Then
I
got
up
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
put
on
my
rags
,
lifted
up
my
hands
to
heaven
and
set
off
to
his
*NL*
excellency
Ivan
Afanasyvitch
.
His
excellency
Ivan
Afanasyvitch
,
do
you
*NL*
know
him
?
No
?
Well
,
then
,
it
's
a
man
of
God
you
do
n't
know
.
He
is
wax
...
*NL*
wax
before
the
face
of
the
Lord
;
even
as
wax
melteth
!
...
His
eyes
were
*NL*
dim
when
he
heard
my
story
.
`
Marmeladov
,
once
already
you
have
*NL*
deceived
my
expectations
...
I
'll
take
you
once
more

my
own
*NL*
responsibility

--
that
's
what
he
said
,
`
remember
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
now
you
*NL*
can
go
.
'
I
kissed
the
dust
at
his
feet
--
in
thought
only
,
for
in
reality
*NL*
he
would
not
have
allowed
me
to
do
it
,
being
a
statesman
and
a
man
of
*NL*
modern
political
and
enlightened
ideas
.
I
returned
home
,
and
when
I
*NL*
announced
that
I
'd
been
taken
back
into
the
service
and
should
receive
a
*NL*
salary
,
heavens
,
what
a
to-do
there
was
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marmeladov
stopped
again
in
violent
excitement
.
At
that
moment
a
whole
*NL*
party
of
revellers
already
drunk
came
in
from
the
street
,
and
the
sounds
*NL*
of
a
hired
concertina
and
the
cracked
piping
voice
of
a
child
of
seven
*NL*
singing
``
The
Hamlet
''
were
heard
in
the
entry
.
The
room
was
filled
with
*NL*
noise
.
The
tavern-keeper
and
the
boys
were
busy
with
the
new-comers
.
*NL*
Marmeladov
paying
no
attention
to
the
new
arrivals
continued
his
story
.
*NL*
He
appeared
by
now
to
be
extremely
weak
,
but
as
he
became
more
and
more
*NL*
drunk
,
he
became
more
and
more
talkative
.
The
recollection
of
his
*NL*
recent
success
in
getting
the
situation
seemed
to
revive
him
,
and
was
*NL*
positively
reflected
in
a
sort
of
radiance
on
his
face
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
listened
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
five
weeks
ago
,
sir
.
Yes
...
As
soon
as
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
and
Sonia
heard
of
it
,
mercy
on
us
,
it
was
as
though
I
stepped
into
the
*NL*
kingdom
of
Heaven
.
It
used
to
be
:
you
can
lie
like
a
beast
,
nothing
but
*NL*
abuse
.
Now
they
were
walking
on
tiptoe
,
hushing
the
children
.
`
Semyon
*NL*
Zaharovitch
is
tired
with
his
work
at
the
office
,
he
is
resting
,
shh
!
'
*NL*
They
made
me
coffee
before
I
went
to
work
and
boiled
cream
for
me
!
They
*NL*
began
to
get
real
cream
for
me
,
do
you
hear
that
?
And
how
they
managed
*NL*
to
get
together
the
money
for
a
decent
outfit
--
eleven
roubles
,
fifty
*NL*
copecks
,
I
ca
n't
guess
.
Boots
,
cotton
shirt-fronts
--
most
magnificent
,
*NL*
a
uniform
,
they
got
up
all
in
splendid
style
,
for
eleven
roubles
and
*NL*
a
half
.
The
first
morning
I
came
back
from
the
office
I
found
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
had
cooked
two
courses
for
dinner
--
soup
and
salt
meat
with
*NL*
horse
radish
--
which
we
had
never
dreamed
of
till
then
.
She
had
not
any
*NL*
dresses
...
none
at
all
,
but
she
got
herself
up
as
though
she
were
going
*NL*
on
a
visit
;
and
not
that
she
'd
anything
to
do
it
with
,
she
smartened
*NL*
herself
up
with
nothing
at
all
,
she
'd
done
her
hair
nicely
,
put
on
a
*NL*
clean
collar
of
some
sort
,
cuffs
,
and
there
she
was
,
quite
a
different
*NL*
person
,
she
was
younger
and
better
looking
.
Sonia
,
my
little
darling
,
*NL*
had
only
helped
with
money
`
for
the
time
,
'
she
said
,
`
it
wo
n't
do
for
me
*NL*
to
come
and
see
you
too
often
.
After
dark
maybe
when
no
one
can
see
.
'
Do
*NL*
you
hear
,
do
you
hear
?
I
lay
down
for
a
nap
after
dinner
and
what
do
you
*NL*
think
:
though
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
quarrelled
to
the
last
degree
with
*NL*
our
landlady
Amalia
Fyodorovna
only
a
week
before
,
she
could
not
*NL*
resist
then
asking
her
in
to
coffee
.
For
two
hours
they
were
sitting
,
*NL*
whispering
together
.
`
Semyon
Zaharovitch
is
in
the
service
again
,
*NL*
now
,
and
receiving
a
salary
,
'
says
she
,
`
and
he
went
himself
to
his
*NL*
excellency
and
his
excellency
himself
came
out
to
him
,
made
all
the
*NL*
others
wait
and
led
Semyon
Zaharovitch
by
the
hand
before
everybody
into
*NL*
his
study
.
'
Do
you
hear
,
do
you
hear
?
`
To
be
sure
,
'
says
he
,
`
Semyon
*NL*
Zaharovitch
,
remembering
your
past
services
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
your
propensity
to
that
foolish
weakness
,
since
you
promise
now
and
*NL*
since
moreover
we
've
got
on
badly
without
you
,
'
-LRB-
do
you
hear
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
;-RRB-
`
and
so
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
rely
now
on
your
word
as
a
gentleman
.
'
And
*NL*
all
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
she
has
simply
made
up
for
herself
,
and
not
*NL*
simply
out
of
wantonness
,
for
the
sake
of
bragging
;
no
,
she
believes
it
*NL*
all
herself
,
she
amuses
herself
with
her
own
fancies
,
upon
my
word
she
*NL*
does
!
And
I
do
n't
blame
her
for
it
,
no
,
I
do
n't
blame
her
!
...
Six
days
*NL*
ago
when
I
brought
her
my
first
earnings
in
full
--
twenty-three
roubles
*NL*
forty
copecks
altogether
--
she
called
me
her
poppet
:
`
poppet
,
'
said
she
,
*NL*
`
my
little
poppet
.
'
And
when
we
were
by
ourselves
,
you
understand
?
*NL*
You
would
not
think
me
a
beauty
,
you
would
not
think
much
of
me
as
a
*NL*
husband
,
would
you
?
...
Well
,
she
pinched
my
cheek
,
`
my
little
poppet
,
'
*NL*
said
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marmeladov
broke
off
,
tried
to
smile
,
but
suddenly
his
chin
began
*NL*
to
twitch
.
He
controlled
himself
however
.
The
tavern
,
the
degraded
*NL*
appearance
of
the
man
,
the
five
nights
in
the
hay
barge
,
and
the
pot
of
*NL*
spirits
,
and
yet
this
poignant
love
for
his
wife
and
children
bewildered
*NL*
his
listener
.
Raskolnikov
listened
intently
but
with
a
sick
sensation
.
*NL*
He
felt
vexed
that
he
had
come
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honoured
sir
,
honoured
sir
,
''
cried
Marmeladov
recovering
himself
--
``
Oh
,
*NL*
sir
,
perhaps
all
this
seems
a
laughing
matter
to
you
,
as
it
does
to
*NL*
others
,
and
perhaps
I
am
only
worrying
you
with
the
stupidity
of
all
the
*NL*
trivial
details
of
my
home
life
,
but
it
is
not
a
laughing
matter
to
me
.
*NL*
For
I
can
feel
it
all
...
And
the
whole
of
that
heavenly
day
of
my
life
*NL*
and
the
whole
of
that
evening
I
passed
in
fleeting
dreams
of
how
I
would
*NL*
arrange
it
all
,
and
how
I
would
dress
all
the
children
,
and
how
I
should
*NL*
give
her
rest
,
and
how
I
should
rescue
my
own
daughter
from
dishonour
*NL*
and
restore
her
to
the
bosom
of
her
family
...
And
a
great
deal
more
...
*NL*
Quite
excusable
,
sir
.
Well
,
then
,
sir
''
-LRB-
Marmeladov
suddenly
gave
a
sort
*NL*
of
start
,
raised
his
head
and
gazed
intently
at
his
listener
-RRB-
``
well
,
on
*NL*
the
very
next
day
after
all
those
dreams
,
that
is
to
say
,
exactly
five
*NL*
days
ago
,
in
the
evening
,
by
a
cunning
trick
,
like
a
thief
in
the
night
,
*NL*
I
stole
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
the
key
of
her
box
,
took
out
what
was
*NL*
left
of
my
earnings
,
how
much
it
was
I
have
forgotten
,
and
now
look
*NL*
at
me
,
all
of
you
!
It
's
the
fifth
day
since
I
left
home
,
and
they
are
*NL*
looking
for
me
there
and
it
's
the
end
of
my
employment
,
and
my
uniform
*NL*
is
lying
in
a
tavern
on
the
Egyptian
bridge
.
I
exchanged
it
for
the
*NL*
garments
I
have
on
...
and
it
's
the
end
of
everything

*NL*
*NL*
Marmeladov
struck
his
forehead
with
his
fist
,
clenched
his
teeth
,
closed
*NL*
his
eyes
and
leaned
heavily
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
.
But
a
minute
*NL*
later
his
face
suddenly
changed
and
with
a
certain
assumed
slyness
and
*NL*
affectation
of
bravado
,
he
glanced
at
Raskolnikov
,
laughed
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
I
went
to
see
Sonia
,
I
went
to
ask
her
for
a
pick-me-up
!

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
she
gave
it
to
you
?
''
cried
one
of
the
new-comers
;
he
*NL*
shouted
the
words
and
went
off
into
a
guffaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
very
quart
was
bought
with
her
money
,
''
Marmeladov
declared
,
*NL*
addressing
himself
exclusively
to
Raskolnikov
.
``
Thirty
copecks
she
gave
*NL*
me
with
her
own
hands
,
her
last
,
all
she
had
,
as
I
saw
...
She
said
*NL*
nothing
,
she
only
looked
at
me
without
a
word
...
Not
on
earth
,
but
up
*NL*
yonder
...
they
grieve
over
men
,
they
weep
,
but
they
do
n't
blame
them
,
*NL*
they
do
n't
blame
them
!
But
it
hurts
more
,
it
hurts
more
when
they
do
n't
*NL*
blame
!
Thirty
copecks
yes
!
And
maybe
she
needs
them
now
,
eh
?
What
do
*NL*
you
think
,
my
dear
sir
?
For
now
she
's
got
to
keep
up
her
appearance
.
It
*NL*
costs
money
,
that
smartness
,
that
special
smartness
,
you
know
?
Do
you
*NL*
understand
?
And
there
's
pomatum
,
too

you
see
,
she
must
have
things
;
*NL*
petticoats
,
starched
ones

shoes

too
,
real
jaunty
ones
to
show
off
her
*NL*
foot
when
she
has
to
step
over
a
puddle

Do
you
understand
,
sir

do
you
*NL*
understand
what
all
that
smartness
means
?
And
here
I
,
her
own
father

*NL*
here
I
took
thirty
copecks
of
that
money
for
a
drink
!
And
I
am
drinking
*NL*
it
!
And
I
have
already
drunk
it

Come

who
will
have
pity
on
a
man
like
*NL*
me
,
eh

Are
you
sorry
for
me
,

Tell
me

are
you
sorry
*NL*

He-he-he

*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
filled
his
glass
,
but
there
was
no
drink
left
.
The
pot
was
*NL*
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
to
be
pitied
for

shouted
the
tavern-keeper
who
was
again
*NL*
near
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shouts
of
laughter
and
even
oaths
followed
.
The
laughter
and
the
oaths
*NL*
came
from
those
who
were
listening
and
also
from
those
who
had
heard
*NL*
nothing
but
were
simply
looking
at
the
figure
of
the
discharged
*NL*
government
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
pitied
!
Why
am
I
to
be
pitied

Marmeladov
suddenly
declaimed
,
*NL*
standing
up
with
his
arm
outstretched
,
as
though
he
had
been
only
*NL*
waiting
for
that
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
am
I
to
be
pitied

Yes

there
's
nothing

Crucify
me

crucify

pity
me

And
then
I
will
go
of
myself
to
be

not
merry-making

tribulation

Do
you
suppose

you
that
sell
,
that
this
pint
of
yours
has
been
*NL*
sweet
to
me

It
was
tribulation
I
sought
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
tears
and
*NL*
tribulation
,
and
have
found
it
,
and
I
have
tasted
it

us

is
the
judge

He
will
come
in
that
day
*NL*
and
He
will
ask
:
`
Where
is
the
daughter
who
gave
herself
for
her
cross
,
*NL*
consumptive
step-mother
and
for
the
little
children
of
another

Where
is

the
daughter
who
had
pity
upon
the
filthy
drunkard
,
her
earthly
father
,
*NL*
undismayed
by
his
beastliness
?

And
He
will
say
,
`
Come
to
me
!
I
have
*NL*
already
forgiven
thee
once

I
have
forgiven
thee
once

Thy
sins
*NL*
which
are
many
are
forgiven
thee

And
he
*NL*
will
forgive
my
Sonia

He
will
forgive
,
I
know
it

I
felt
it
in
my
*NL*
heart
when
I
was
with
her
just
now

And
He
will
judge
and
will
forgive
*NL*
all
,
the
good
and
the
evil
,
the
wise
and
the
meek
...
And
when
He
has
*NL*
done
with
all
of
them
,
then
He
will
summon
us
.
`
You
too
come
forth

He
will
say
,
`
Come
forth

come
forth

weak
ones

forth

shame

And
we
shall
all
come
forth
,
without
shame
*NL*
and
shall
stand
before
him
.
And
He
will
say
unto
us
,
`
Ye
are
swine

made
*NL*
in
the
Image
of
the
Beast
and
with
his
mark

come
ye
also

And
the

wise
ones
and
those
of
understanding
will
say
,
`

Lord

why
dost
Thou
*NL*
receive
these

And
He
will

this
is
why
I
receive

ye
of

fall
down

him

''
And
he
sank
down
on
the
bench
exhausted
,
and
*NL*
helpless
,
looking
at
no
one
,
apparently
oblivious
of
his
surroundings
*NL*
and
plunged
in
deep
thought
.
His
words
had
created
a
certain
impression
;
*NL*
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
;
but
soon
laughter
and
oaths
were
heard
*NL*
again

*NL*
``
That

``
A
fine
clerk
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
sir
,
''
said
Marmeladov
all
at
once
,
raising
his
head
and
*NL*
addressing
Raskolnikov
--
``
come
along
with
me
...
Kozel
's
house
,
looking
*NL*
into
the
yard
.
I
'm
going
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
--
time
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
for
some
time
been
wanting
to
go
and
he
had
meant
to
*NL*
help
him
.
Marmeladov
was
much
unsteadier
on
his
legs
than
in
his
speech
*NL*
and
leaned
heavily
on
the
young
man
.
They
had
two
or
three
hundred
*NL*
paces
to
go
.
The
drunken
man
was
more
and
more
overcome
by
dismay
and
*NL*
confusion
as
they
drew
nearer
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
Katerina
Ivanovna
I
am
afraid
of
now
,
''
he
muttered
in
*NL*
agitation
--
``
and
that
she
will
begin
pulling
my
hair
.
What
does
my
hair
*NL*
matter
!
Bother
my
hair
!
That
's
what
I
say
!
Indeed
it
will
be
better
if
*NL*
she
does
begin
pulling
it
,
that
's
not
what
I
am
afraid
of
...
it
's
her
*NL*
eyes
I
am
afraid
of
...
yes
,
her
eyes
...
the
red
on
her
cheeks
,
too
,
*NL*
frightens
me
...
and
her
breathing
too
...
Have
you
noticed
how
people
*NL*
in
that
disease
breathe
...
when
they
are
excited
?
I
am
frightened
of
*NL*
the
children
's
crying
,
too
...
For
if
Sonia
has
not
taken
them
food
...
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
's
happened
!
I
do
n't
know
!
But
blows
I
am
not
afraid
*NL*
of
...
Know
,
sir
,
that
such
blows
are
not
a
pain
to
me
,
but
even
an
*NL*
enjoyment
.
In
fact
I
ca
n't
get
on
without
it
...
It
's
better
so
.
Let
*NL*
her
strike
me
,
it
relieves
her
heart
...
it
's
better
so
...
There
is
the
*NL*
house
.
The
house
of
Kozel
,
the
cabinet-maker
...
a
German
,
well-to-do
.
*NL*
Lead
the
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
in
from
the
yard
and
up
to
the
fourth
storey
.
The
staircase
*NL*
got
darker
and
darker
as
they
went
up
.
It
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
*NL*
and
although
in
summer
in
Petersburg
there
is
no
real
night
,
yet
it
was
*NL*
quite
dark
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
grimy
little
door
at
the
very
top
of
the
stairs
stood
ajar
.
A
very
*NL*
poor-looking
room
about
ten
paces
long
was
lighted
up
by
a
candle-end
;
*NL*
the
whole
of
it
was
visible
from
the
entrance
.
It
was
all
in
disorder
,
*NL*
littered
up
with
rags
of
all
sorts
,
especially
children
's
garments
.
*NL*
Across
the
furthest
corner
was
stretched
a
ragged
sheet
.
Behind
it
*NL*
probably
was
the
bed
.
There
was
nothing
in
the
room
except
two
chairs
*NL*
and
a
sofa
covered
with
American
leather
,
full
of
holes
,
before
which
*NL*
stood
an
old
deal
kitchen-table
,
unpainted
and
uncovered
.
At
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
table
stood
a
smoldering
tallow-candle
in
an
iron
candlestick
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
the
family
had
a
room
to
themselves
,
not
part
of
a
room
,
*NL*
but
their
room
was
practically
a
passage
.
The
door
leading
to
the
other
*NL*
rooms
,
or
rather
cupboards
,
into
which
Amalia
Lippevechsel
's
flat
was
*NL*
divided
stood
half
open
,
and
there
was
shouting
,
uproar
and
laughter
*NL*
within
.
People
seemed
to
be
playing
cards
and
drinking
tea
there
.
Words
*NL*
of
the
most
unceremonious
kind
flew
out
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
recognised
Katerina
Ivanovna
at
once
.
She
was
a
rather
tall
,
*NL*
slim
and
graceful
woman
,
terribly
emaciated
,
with
magnificent
dark
brown
*NL*
hair
and
with
a
hectic
flush
in
her
cheeks
.
She
was
pacing
up
and
down
*NL*
in
her
little
room
,
pressing
her
hands
against
her
chest
;
her
lips
*NL*
were
parched
and
her
breathing
came
in
nervous
broken
gasps
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
glittered
as
in
fever
and
looked
about
with
a
harsh
immovable
stare
.
And
*NL*
that
consumptive
and
excited
face
with
the
last
flickering
light
of
the
*NL*
candle-end
playing
upon
it
made
a
sickening
impression
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
about
thirty
years
old
and
was
certainly
a
strange
wife
for
*NL*
Marmeladov
...
She
had
not
heard
them
and
did
not
notice
them
coming
in
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
,
hearing
and
seeing
nothing
.
The
room
*NL*
was
close
,
but
she
had
not
opened
the
window
;
a
stench
rose
from
the
*NL*
staircase
,
but
the
door
on
to
the
stairs
was
not
closed
.
From
the
inner
*NL*
rooms
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
floated
in
,
she
kept
coughing
,
but
did
not
*NL*
close
the
door
.
The
youngest
child
,
a
girl
of
six
,
was
asleep
,
sitting
*NL*
curled
up
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
the
sofa
.
A
boy
a
year
older
*NL*
stood
crying
and
shaking
in
the
corner
,
probably
he
had
just
had
a
*NL*
beating
.
Beside
him
stood
a
girl
of
nine
years
old
,
tall
and
thin
,
*NL*
wearing
a
thin
and
ragged
chemise
with
an
ancient
cashmere
pelisse
flung
*NL*
over
her
bare
shoulders
,
long
outgrown
and
barely
reaching
her
knees
.
*NL*
Her
arm
,
as
thin
as
a
stick
,
was
round
her
brother
's
neck
.
She
was
*NL*
trying
to
comfort
him
,
whispering
something
to
him
,
and
doing
all
she
*NL*
could
to
keep
him
from
whimpering
again
.
At
the
same
time
her
large
*NL*
dark
eyes
,
which
looked
larger
still
from
the
thinness
of
her
frightened
*NL*
face
,
were
watching
her
mother
with
alarm
.
Marmeladov
did
not
enter
the
*NL*
door
,
but
dropped
on
his
knees
in
the
very
doorway
,
pushing
Raskolnikov
*NL*
in
front
of
him
.
The
woman
seeing
a
stranger
stopped
indifferently
*NL*
facing
him
,
coming
to
herself
for
a
moment
and
apparently
wondering
what
*NL*
he
had
come
for
.
But
evidently
she
decided
that
he
was
going
into
*NL*
the
next
room
,
as
he
had
to
pass
through
hers
to
get
there
.
Taking
no
*NL*
further
notice
of
him
,
she
walked
towards
the
outer
door
to
close
it
*NL*
and
uttered
a
sudden
scream
on
seeing
her
husband
on
his
knees
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
cried
out
in
a
frenzy
,
``
he
has
come
back
!
The
criminal
!
the
*NL*
monster
!
...
And
where
is
the
money
?
What
's
in
your
pocket
,
show
me
!
And
*NL*
your
clothes
are
all
different
!
Where
are
your
clothes
?
Where
is
the
*NL*
money
!
Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
fell
to
searching
him
.
Marmeladov
submissively
and
obediently
*NL*
held
up
both
arms
to
facilitate
the
search
.
Not
a
farthing
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
money
?
''
she
cried
--
``
Mercy
on
us
,
can
he
have
drunk
it
all
?
*NL*
There
were
twelve
silver
roubles
left
in
the
chest
!
''
and
in
a
fury
*NL*
she
seized
him
by
the
hair
and
dragged
him
into
the
room
.
Marmeladov
*NL*
seconded
her
efforts
by
meekly
crawling
along
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
a
consolation
to
me
!
This
does
not
hurt
me
,
but
is
a
*NL*
positive
con-so-la-tion
,
ho-nou-red
sir
,
''
he
called
out
,
shaken
to
and
*NL*
fro
by
his
hair
and
even
once
striking
the
ground
with
his
forehead
.
*NL*
The
child
asleep
on
the
floor
woke
up
,
and
began
to
cry
.
The
boy
in
the
*NL*
corner
losing
all
control
began
trembling
and
screaming
and
rushed
*NL*
to
his
sister
in
violent
terror
,
almost
in
a
fit
.
The
eldest
girl
was
*NL*
shaking
like
a
leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
drunk
it
!
he
's
drunk
it
all
,
''
the
poor
woman
screamed
in
*NL*
despair
--
``
and
his
clothes
are
gone
!
And
they
are
hungry
,
hungry
!
''
--
and
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
she
pointed
to
the
children
.
``
Oh
,
accursed
life
!
*NL*
And
you
,
are
you
not
ashamed
?
''
--
she
pounced
all
at
once
upon
*NL*
Raskolnikov
--
``
from
the
tavern
!
Have
you
been
drinking
with
him
?
You
have
*NL*
been
drinking
with
him
,
too
!
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
hastening
away
without
uttering
a
word
.
The
inner
door
*NL*
was
thrown
wide
open
and
inquisitive
faces
were
peering
in
at
it
.
Coarse
*NL*
laughing
faces
with
pipes
and
cigarettes
and
heads
wearing
caps
thrust
*NL*
themselves
in
at
the
doorway
.
Further
in
could
be
seen
figures
in
*NL*
dressing
gowns
flung
open
,
in
costumes
of
unseemly
scantiness
,
some
of
*NL*
them
with
cards
in
their
hands
.
They
were
particularly
diverted
,
when
*NL*
Marmeladov
,
dragged
about
by
his
hair
,
shouted
that
it
was
a
consolation
*NL*
to
him
.
They
even
began
to
come
into
the
room
;
at
last
a
sinister
shrill
*NL*
outcry
was
heard
:
this
came
from
Amalia
Lippevechsel
herself
pushing
her
*NL*
way
amongst
them
and
trying
to
restore
order
after
her
own
fashion
and
*NL*
for
the
hundredth
time
to
frighten
the
poor
woman
by
ordering
her
*NL*
with
coarse
abuse
to
clear
out
of
the
room
next
day
.
As
he
went
out
,
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
time
to
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
to
snatch
up
the
*NL*
coppers
he
had
received
in
exchange
for
his
rouble
in
the
tavern
and
to
*NL*
lay
them
unnoticed
on
the
window
.
Afterwards
on
the
stairs
,
he
changed
*NL*
his
mind
and
would
have
gone
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
stupid
thing
I
've
done
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
``
they
have
Sonia
*NL*
and
I
want
it
myself
.
''
But
reflecting
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
*NL*
take
it
back
now
and
that
in
any
case
he
would
not
have
taken
it
,
he
*NL*
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
went
back
to
his
lodging
.
*NL*
``
Sonia
wants
pomatum
too
,
''
he
said
as
he
walked
along
the
street
,
and
he
*NL*
laughed
malignantly
--
``
such
smartness
costs
money
...
Hm
!
And
maybe
Sonia
*NL*
herself
will
be
bankrupt
to-day
,
for
there
is
always
a
risk
,
hunting
*NL*
big
game
...
digging
for
gold
...
then
they
would
all
be
without
a
crust
*NL*
to-morrow
except
for
my
money
.
Hurrah
for
Sonia
!
What
a
mine
they
've
dug
*NL*
there
!
And
they
're
making
the
most
of
it
!
Yes
,
they
are
making
the
most
*NL*
of
it
!
They
've
wept
over
it
and
grown
used
to
it
.
Man
grows
used
to
*NL*
everything
,
the
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sank
into
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
I
am
wrong
,
''
he
cried
suddenly
after
a
moment
's
thought
.
*NL*
``
What
if
man
is
not
really
a
scoundrel
,
man
in
general
,
I
mean
,
the
*NL*
whole
race
of
mankind
--
then
all
the
rest
is
prejudice
,
simply
artificial
*NL*
terrors
and
there
are
no
barriers
and
it
's
all
as
it
should
be
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
waked
up
late
next
day
after
a
broken
sleep
.
But
his
sleep
had
not
*NL*
refreshed
him
;
he
waked
up
bilious
,
irritable
,
ill-tempered
,
and
looked
*NL*
with
hatred
at
his
room
.
It
was
a
tiny
cupboard
of
a
room
about
six
*NL*
paces
in
length
.
It
had
a
poverty-stricken
appearance
with
its
dusty
*NL*
yellow
paper
peeling
off
the
walls
,
and
it
was
so
low-pitched
that
a
man
*NL*
of
more
than
average
height
was
ill
at
ease
in
it
and
felt
every
moment
*NL*
that
he
would
knock
his
head
against
the
ceiling
.
The
furniture
was
in
*NL*
keeping
with
the
room
:
there
were
three
old
chairs
,
rather
rickety
;
a
*NL*
painted
table
in
the
corner
on
which
lay
a
few
manuscripts
and
books
;
*NL*
the
dust
that
lay
thick
upon
them
showed
that
they
had
been
long
*NL*
untouched
.
A
big
clumsy
sofa
occupied
almost
the
whole
of
one
wall
and
*NL*
half
the
floor
space
of
the
room
;
it
was
once
covered
with
chintz
,
but
*NL*
was
now
in
rags
and
served
Raskolnikov
as
a
bed
.
Often
he
went
to
sleep
*NL*
on
it
,
as
he
was
,
without
undressing
,
without
sheets
,
wrapped
in
his
old
*NL*
student
's
overcoat
,
with
his
head
on
one
little
pillow
,
under
which
he
*NL*
heaped
up
all
the
linen
he
had
,
clean
and
dirty
,
by
way
of
a
bolster
.
A
*NL*
little
table
stood
in
front
of
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
difficult
to
sink
to
a
lower
ebb
of
disorder
,
but
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
in
his
present
state
of
mind
this
was
positively
agreeable
.
*NL*
He
had
got
completely
away
from
everyone
,
like
a
tortoise
in
its
shell
,
*NL*
and
even
the
sight
of
a
servant
girl
who
had
to
wait
upon
him
and
looked
*NL*
sometimes
into
his
room
made
him
writhe
with
nervous
irritation
.
He
was
*NL*
in
the
condition
that
overtakes
some
monomaniacs
entirely
concentrated
*NL*
upon
one
thing
.
His
landlady
had
for
the
last
fortnight
given
up
sending
*NL*
him
in
meals
,
and
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
expostulating
with
her
,
*NL*
though
he
went
without
his
dinner
.
Nastasya
,
the
cook
and
only
servant
,
*NL*
was
rather
pleased
at
the
lodger
's
mood
and
had
entirely
given
up
*NL*
sweeping
and
doing
his
room
,
only
once
a
week
or
so
she
would
stray
into
*NL*
his
room
with
a
broom
.
She
waked
him
up
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
,
why
are
you
asleep
?
''
she
called
to
him
.
``
It
's
past
nine
,
I
have
*NL*
brought
you
some
tea
;
will
you
have
a
cup
?
I
should
think
you
're
fairly
*NL*
starving
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
opened
his
eyes
,
started
and
recognised
Nastasya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
landlady
,
eh
?
''
he
asked
,
slowly
and
with
a
sickly
face
sitting
*NL*
up
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
landlady
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
before
him
her
own
cracked
teapot
full
of
weak
and
stale
tea
and
*NL*
laid
two
yellow
lumps
of
sugar
by
the
side
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Nastasya
,
take
it
please
,
''
he
said
,
fumbling
in
his
pocket
-LRB-
for
*NL*
he
had
slept
in
his
clothes
-RRB-
and
taking
out
a
handful
of
coppers
--
``
run
*NL*
and
buy
me
a
loaf
.
And
get
me
a
little
sausage
,
the
cheapest
,
at
the
*NL*
pork-butcher
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
loaf
I
'll
fetch
you
this
very
minute
,
but
would
n't
you
rather
have
*NL*
some
cabbage
soup
instead
of
sausage
?
It
's
capital
soup
,
yesterday
's
.
I
*NL*
saved
it
for
you
yesterday
,
but
you
came
in
late
.
It
's
fine
soup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
soup
had
been
brought
,
and
he
had
begun
upon
it
,
Nastasya
*NL*
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
sofa
and
began
chatting
.
She
was
a
country
*NL*
peasant-woman
and
a
very
talkative
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Praskovya
Pavlovna
means
to
complain
to
the
police
about
you
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
scowled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
police
?
What
does
she
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
pay
her
money
and
you
wo
n't
turn
out
of
the
room
.
That
's
what
*NL*
she
wants
,
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
,
that
's
the
last
straw
,
''
he
muttered
,
grinding
his
teeth
,
*NL*
``
no
,
that
would
not
suit
me
...
just
now
.
She
is
a
fool
,
''
he
added
aloud
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
talk
to
her
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
she
is
and
no
mistake
,
just
as
I
am
.
But
why
,
if
you
are
so
*NL*
clever
,
do
you
lie
here
like
a
sack
and
have
nothing
to
show
for
it
?
One
*NL*
time
you
used
to
go
out
,
you
say
,
to
teach
children
.
But
why
is
it
you
*NL*
do
nothing
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
doing
...
''
Raskolnikov
began
sullenly
and
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Work
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
,
''
he
answered
seriously
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasya
was
overcome
with
a
fit
of
laughter
.
She
was
given
to
laughter
*NL*
and
when
anything
amused
her
,
she
laughed
inaudibly
,
quivering
and
*NL*
shaking
all
over
till
she
felt
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
made
much
money
by
your
thinking
?
''
she
managed
to
*NL*
articulate
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
ca
n't
go
out
to
give
lessons
without
boots
.
And
I
'm
sick
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
quarrel
with
your
bread
and
butter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
pay
so
little
for
lessons
.
What
's
the
use
of
a
few
coppers
?
''
he
*NL*
answered
,
reluctantly
,
as
though
replying
to
his
own
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
want
to
get
a
fortune
all
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
want
a
fortune
,
''
he
answered
firmly
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
in
such
a
hurry
,
you
quite
frighten
me
!
Shall
I
get
you
the
*NL*
loaf
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
forgot
!
A
letter
came
for
you
yesterday
when
you
were
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
?
for
me
!
from
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
.
I
gave
three
copecks
of
my
own
to
the
postman
for
it
.
Will
*NL*
you
pay
me
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
bring
it
to
me
,
for
God
's
sake
,
bring
it
,
''
cried
Raskolnikov
*NL*
greatly
excited
--
``
good
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
the
letter
was
brought
him
.
That
was
it
:
from
his
mother
,
*NL*
from
the
province
of
R
--
.
He
turned
pale
when
he
took
it
.
It
was
a
*NL*
long
while
since
he
had
received
a
letter
,
but
another
feeling
also
*NL*
suddenly
stabbed
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasya
,
leave
me
alone
,
for
goodness
'
sake
;
here
are
your
three
*NL*
copecks
,
but
for
goodness
'
sake
,
make
haste
and
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
quivering
in
his
hand
;
he
did
not
want
to
open
it
in
her
*NL*
presence
;
he
wanted
to
be
left
_
alone
_
with
this
letter
.
When
Nastasya
*NL*
had
gone
out
,
he
lifted
it
quickly
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
;
then
he
*NL*
gazed
intently
at
the
address
,
the
small
,
sloping
handwriting
,
so
dear
*NL*
and
familiar
,
of
the
mother
who
had
once
taught
him
to
read
and
write
.
*NL*
He
delayed
;
he
seemed
almost
afraid
of
something
.
At
last
he
opened
it
;
*NL*
it
was
a
thick
heavy
letter
,
weighing
over
two
ounces
,
two
large
sheets
*NL*
of
note
paper
were
covered
with
very
small
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rodya
,
''
wrote
his
mother
--
``
it
's
two
months
since
I
last
had
a
*NL*
talk
with
you
by
letter
which
has
distressed
me
and
even
kept
me
*NL*
awake
at
night
,
thinking
.
But
I
am
sure
you
will
not
blame
me
for
my
*NL*
inevitable
silence
.
You
know
how
I
love
you
;
you
are
all
we
have
to
look
*NL*
to
,
Dounia
and
I
,
you
are
our
all
,
our
one
hope
,
our
one
stay
.
What
a
*NL*
grief
it
was
to
me
when
I
heard
that
you
had
given
up
the
university
*NL*
some
months
ago
,
for
want
of
means
to
keep
yourself
and
that
you
had
*NL*
lost
your
lessons
and
your
other
work
!
How
could
I
help
you
out
of
my
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty
roubles
a
year
pension
?
The
fifteen
roubles
I
sent
*NL*
you
four
months
ago
I
borrowed
,
as
you
know
,
on
security
of
my
pension
,
*NL*
from
Vassily
Ivanovitch
Vahrushin
a
merchant
of
this
town
.
He
is
a
*NL*
kind-hearted
man
and
was
a
friend
of
your
father
's
too
.
But
having
given
*NL*
him
the
right
to
receive
the
pension
,
I
had
to
wait
till
the
debt
was
*NL*
paid
off
and
that
is
only
just
done
,
so
that
I
've
been
unable
to
send
*NL*
you
anything
all
this
time
.
But
now
,
thank
God
,
I
believe
I
shall
*NL*
be
able
to
send
you
something
more
and
in
fact
we
may
congratulate
*NL*
ourselves
on
our
good
fortune
now
,
of
which
I
hasten
to
inform
you
.
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
would
you
have
guessed
,
dear
Rodya
,
that
your
sister
*NL*
has
been
living
with
me
for
the
last
six
weeks
and
we
shall
not
be
*NL*
separated
in
the
future
.
Thank
God
,
her
sufferings
are
over
,
but
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
everything
in
order
,
so
that
you
may
know
just
how
everything
*NL*
has
happened
and
all
that
we
have
hitherto
concealed
from
you
.
When
you
*NL*
wrote
to
me
two
months
ago
that
you
had
heard
that
Dounia
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
to
put
up
with
in
the
Svidrigrailovs
'
house
,
when
you
wrote
that
*NL*
and
asked
me
to
tell
you
all
about
it
--
what
could
I
write
in
answer
to
*NL*
you
?
If
I
had
written
the
whole
truth
to
you
,
I
dare
say
you
would
have
*NL*
thrown
up
everything
and
have
come
to
us
,
even
if
you
had
to
walk
all
*NL*
the
way
,
for
I
know
your
character
and
your
feelings
,
and
you
would
not
*NL*
let
your
sister
be
insulted
.
I
was
in
despair
myself
,
but
what
could
I
*NL*
do
?
And
,
besides
,
I
did
not
know
the
whole
truth
myself
then
.
What
*NL*
made
it
all
so
difficult
was
that
Dounia
received
a
hundred
roubles
*NL*
in
advance
when
she
took
the
place
as
governess
in
their
family
,
on
*NL*
condition
of
part
of
her
salary
being
deducted
every
month
,
and
so
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
throw
up
the
situation
without
repaying
the
debt
.
*NL*
This
sum
-LRB-
now
I
can
explain
it
all
to
you
,
my
precious
Rodya
-RRB-
she
took
*NL*
chiefly
in
order
to
send
you
sixty
roubles
,
which
you
needed
so
terribly
*NL*
then
and
which
you
received
from
us
last
year
.
We
deceived
you
then
,
*NL*
writing
that
this
money
came
from
Dounia
's
savings
,
but
that
was
not
*NL*
so
,
and
now
I
tell
you
all
about
it
,
because
,
thank
God
,
things
have
*NL*
suddenly
changed
for
the
better
,
and
that
you
may
know
how
Dounia
loves
*NL*
you
and
what
a
heart
she
has
.
At
first
indeed
Mr.
Svidrigailov
treated
*NL*
her
very
rudely
and
used
to
make
disrespectful
and
jeering
remarks
at
*NL*
table
...
But
I
do
n't
want
to
go
into
all
those
painful
details
,
so
as
*NL*
not
to
worry
you
for
nothing
when
it
is
now
all
over
.
In
short
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
kind
and
generous
behaviour
of
Marfa
Petrovna
,
Mr.
Svidrigailov
's
*NL*
wife
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
household
,
Dounia
had
a
very
hard
time
,
*NL*
especially
when
Mr.
Svidrigailov
,
relapsing
into
his
old
regimental
*NL*
habits
,
was
under
the
influence
of
Bacchus
.
And
how
do
you
think
it
*NL*
was
all
explained
later
on
?
Would
you
believe
that
the
crazy
fellow
had
*NL*
conceived
a
passion
for
Dounia
from
the
beginning
,
but
had
concealed
*NL*
it
under
a
show
of
rudeness
and
contempt
.
Possibly
he
was
ashamed
and
*NL*
horrified
himself
at
his
own
flighty
hopes
,
considering
his
years
and
*NL*
his
being
the
father
of
a
family
;
and
that
made
him
angry
with
Dounia
.
*NL*
And
possibly
,
too
,
he
hoped
by
his
rude
and
sneering
behaviour
to
hide
*NL*
the
truth
from
others
.
But
at
last
he
lost
all
control
and
had
the
face
*NL*
to
make
Dounia
an
open
and
shameful
proposal
,
promising
her
all
sorts
of
*NL*
inducements
and
offering
,
besides
,
to
throw
up
everything
and
take
her
*NL*
to
another
estate
of
his
,
or
even
abroad
.
You
can
imagine
all
she
went
*NL*
through
!
To
leave
her
situation
at
once
was
impossible
not
only
on
*NL*
account
of
the
money
debt
,
but
also
to
spare
the
feelings
of
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
,
whose
suspicions
would
have
been
aroused
:
and
then
Dounia
*NL*
would
have
been
the
cause
of
a
rupture
in
the
family
.
And
it
would
*NL*
have
meant
a
terrible
scandal
for
Dounia
too
;
that
would
have
been
*NL*
inevitable
.
There
were
various
other
reasons
owing
to
which
Dounia
could
*NL*
not
hope
to
escape
from
that
awful
house
for
another
six
weeks
.
You
know
*NL*
Dounia
,
of
course
;
you
know
how
clever
she
is
and
what
a
strong
will
she
*NL*
has
.
Dounia
can
endure
a
great
deal
and
even
in
the
most
difficult
cases
*NL*
she
has
the
fortitude
to
maintain
her
firmness
.
She
did
not
even
write
*NL*
to
me
about
everything
for
fear
of
upsetting
me
,
although
we
were
*NL*
constantly
in
communication
.
It
all
ended
very
unexpectedly
.
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
accidentally
overheard
her
husband
imploring
Dounia
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
,
putting
quite
a
wrong
interpretation
on
the
position
,
threw
*NL*
the
blame
upon
her
,
believing
her
to
be
the
cause
of
it
all
.
An
awful
*NL*
scene
took
place
between
them
on
the
spot
in
the
garden
;
Marfa
Petrovna
*NL*
went
so
far
as
to
strike
Dounia
,
refused
to
hear
anything
and
was
*NL*
shouting
at
her
for
a
whole
hour
and
then
gave
orders
that
Dounia
should
*NL*
be
packed
off
at
once
to
me
in
a
plain
peasant
's
cart
,
into
which
they
*NL*
flung
all
her
things
,
her
linen
and
her
clothes
,
all
pell-mell
,
without
*NL*
folding
it
up
and
packing
it
.
And
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
came
on
,
too
,
*NL*
and
Dounia
,
insulted
and
put
to
shame
,
had
to
drive
with
a
peasant
in
an
*NL*
open
cart
all
the
seventeen
versts
into
town
.
Only
think
now
what
answer
*NL*
could
I
have
sent
to
the
letter
I
received
from
you
two
months
ago
and
*NL*
what
could
I
have
written
?
I
was
in
despair
;
I
dared
not
write
to
*NL*
you
the
truth
because
you
would
have
been
very
unhappy
,
mortified
*NL*
and
indignant
,
and
yet
what
could
you
do
?
You
could
only
perhaps
ruin
*NL*
yourself
,
and
,
besides
,
Dounia
would
not
allow
it
;
and
fill
up
my
letter
*NL*
with
trifles
when
my
heart
was
so
full
of
sorrow
,
I
could
not
.
For
a
*NL*
whole
month
the
town
was
full
of
gossip
about
this
scandal
,
and
it
came
*NL*
to
such
a
pass
that
Dounia
and
I
dared
not
even
go
to
church
on
account
*NL*
of
the
contemptuous
looks
,
whispers
,
and
even
remarks
made
aloud
about
*NL*
us
.
All
our
acquaintances
avoided
us
,
nobody
even
bowed
to
us
in
the
*NL*
street
,
and
I
learnt
that
some
shopmen
and
clerks
were
intending
to
*NL*
insult
us
in
a
shameful
way
,
smearing
the
gates
of
our
house
with
pitch
,
*NL*
so
that
the
landlord
began
to
tell
us
we
must
leave
.
All
this
was
set
*NL*
going
by
Marfa
Petrovna
who
managed
to
slander
Dounia
and
throw
dirt
at
*NL*
her
in
every
family
.
She
knows
everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
that
*NL*
month
she
was
continually
coming
into
the
town
,
and
as
she
is
*NL*
rather
talkative
and
fond
of
gossiping
about
her
family
affairs
and
*NL*
particularly
of
complaining
to
all
and
each
of
her
husband
--
which
is
not
*NL*
at
all
right
--
so
in
a
short
time
she
had
spread
her
story
not
only
in
*NL*
the
town
,
but
over
the
whole
surrounding
district
.
It
made
me
ill
,
but
*NL*
Dounia
bore
it
better
than
I
did
,
and
if
only
you
could
have
seen
how
*NL*
she
endured
it
all
and
tried
to
comfort
me
and
cheer
me
up
!
She
is
*NL*
an
angel
!
But
by
God
's
mercy
,
our
sufferings
were
cut
short
:
Mr.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
returned
to
his
senses
and
repented
and
,
probably
*NL*
feeling
sorry
for
Dounia
,
he
laid
before
Marfa
Petrovna
a
complete
and
*NL*
unmistakable
proof
of
Dounia
's
innocence
,
in
the
form
of
a
letter
Dounia
*NL*
had
been
forced
to
write
and
give
to
him
,
before
Marfa
Petrovna
*NL*
came
upon
them
in
the
garden
.
This
letter
,
which
remained
in
Mr.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
's
hands
after
her
departure
,
she
had
written
to
refuse
*NL*
personal
explanations
and
secret
interviews
,
for
which
he
was
entreating
*NL*
her
.
In
that
letter
she
reproached
him
with
great
heat
and
indignation
*NL*
for
the
baseness
of
his
behaviour
in
regard
to
Marfa
Petrovna
,
reminding
*NL*
him
that
he
was
the
father
and
head
of
a
family
and
telling
him
how
*NL*
infamous
it
was
of
him
to
torment
and
make
unhappy
a
defenceless
girl
,
*NL*
unhappy
enough
already
.
Indeed
,
dear
Rodya
,
the
letter
was
so
nobly
and
*NL*
touchingly
written
that
I
sobbed
when
I
read
it
and
to
this
day
I
can
not
*NL*
read
it
without
tears
.
Moreover
,
the
evidence
of
the
servants
,
too
,
*NL*
cleared
Dounia
's
reputation
;
they
had
seen
and
known
a
great
deal
more
*NL*
than
Mr.
Svidrigailov
had
himself
supposed
--
as
indeed
is
always
the
case
*NL*
with
servants
.
Marfa
Petrovna
was
completely
taken
aback
,
and
`
again
*NL*
crushed
'
as
she
said
herself
to
us
,
but
she
was
completely
convinced
of
*NL*
Dounia
's
innocence
.
The
very
next
day
,
being
Sunday
,
she
went
straight
*NL*
to
the
Cathedral
,
knelt
down
and
prayed
with
tears
to
Our
Lady
to
give
*NL*
her
strength
to
bear
this
new
trial
and
to
do
her
duty
.
Then
she
*NL*
came
straight
from
the
Cathedral
to
us
,
told
us
the
whole
story
,
wept
*NL*
bitterly
and
,
fully
penitent
,
she
embraced
Dounia
and
besought
her
to
*NL*
forgive
her
.
The
same
morning
without
any
delay
,
she
went
round
to
all
*NL*
the
houses
in
the
town
and
everywhere
,
shedding
tears
,
she
asserted
in
*NL*
the
most
flattering
terms
Dounia
's
innocence
and
the
nobility
of
*NL*
her
feelings
and
her
behavior
.
What
was
more
,
she
showed
and
read
to
*NL*
everyone
the
letter
in
Dounia
's
own
handwriting
to
Mr.
Svidrigailov
and
*NL*
even
allowed
them
to
take
copies
of
it
--
which
I
must
say
I
think
was
*NL*
superfluous
.
In
this
way
she
was
busy
for
several
days
in
driving
about
*NL*
the
whole
town
,
because
some
people
had
taken
offence
through
precedence
*NL*
having
been
given
to
others
.
And
therefore
they
had
to
take
turns
,
so
*NL*
that
in
every
house
she
was
expected
before
she
arrived
,
and
everyone
*NL*
knew
that
on
such
and
such
a
day
Marfa
Petrovna
would
be
reading
the
*NL*
letter
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
people
assembled
for
every
reading
*NL*
of
it
,
even
many
who
had
heard
it
several
times
already
both
in
their
*NL*
own
houses
and
in
other
people
's
.
In
my
opinion
a
great
deal
,
a
very
*NL*
great
deal
of
all
this
was
unnecessary
;
but
that
's
Marfa
Petrovna
's
*NL*
character
.
Anyway
she
succeeded
in
completely
re-establishing
Dounia
's
*NL*
reputation
and
the
whole
ignominy
of
this
affair
rested
as
an
indelible
*NL*
disgrace
upon
her
husband
,
as
the
only
person
to
blame
,
so
that
I
really
*NL*
began
to
feel
sorry
for
him
;
it
was
really
treating
the
crazy
fellow
too
*NL*
harshly
.
Dounia
was
at
once
asked
to
give
lessons
in
several
families
,
*NL*
but
she
refused
.
All
of
a
sudden
everyone
began
to
treat
her
with
marked
*NL*
respect
and
all
this
did
much
to
bring
about
the
event
by
which
,
one
may
*NL*
say
,
our
whole
fortunes
are
now
transformed
.
You
must
know
,
dear
Rodya
,
*NL*
that
Dounia
has
a
suitor
and
that
she
has
already
consented
to
marry
*NL*
him
.
I
hasten
to
tell
you
all
about
the
matter
,
and
though
it
has
been
*NL*
arranged
without
asking
your
consent
,
I
think
you
will
not
be
aggrieved
*NL*
with
me
or
with
your
sister
on
that
account
,
for
you
will
see
that
we
*NL*
could
not
wait
and
put
off
our
decision
till
we
heard
from
you
.
And
you
*NL*
could
not
have
judged
all
the
facts
without
being
on
the
spot
.
This
*NL*
was
how
it
happened
.
He
is
already
of
the
rank
of
a
counsellor
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
Luzhin
,
and
is
distantly
related
to
Marfa
Petrovna
,
who
*NL*
has
been
very
active
in
bringing
the
match
about
.
It
began
with
his
*NL*
expressing
through
her
his
desire
to
make
our
acquaintance
.
He
was
*NL*
properly
received
,
drank
coffee
with
us
and
the
very
next
day
he
sent
*NL*
us
a
letter
in
which
he
very
courteously
made
an
offer
and
begged
for
a
*NL*
speedy
and
decided
answer
.
He
is
a
very
busy
man
and
is
in
a
great
hurry
*NL*
to
get
to
Petersburg
,
so
that
every
moment
is
precious
to
him
.
At
first
,
*NL*
of
course
,
we
were
greatly
surprised
,
as
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
*NL*
and
unexpectedly
.
We
thought
and
talked
it
over
the
whole
day
.
He
is
a
*NL*
well-to-do
man
,
to
be
depended
upon
,
he
has
two
posts
in
the
government
*NL*
and
has
already
made
his
fortune
.
It
is
true
that
he
is
forty-five
years
*NL*
old
,
but
he
is
of
a
fairly
prepossessing
appearance
and
might
still
be
*NL*
thought
attractive
by
women
,
and
he
is
altogether
a
very
respectable
and
*NL*
presentable
man
,
only
he
seems
a
little
morose
and
somewhat
conceited
.
*NL*
But
possibly
that
may
only
be
the
impression
he
makes
at
first
sight
.
*NL*
And
beware
,
dear
Rodya
,
when
he
comes
to
Petersburg
,
as
he
shortly
will
*NL*
do
,
beware
of
judging
him
too
hastily
and
severely
,
as
your
way
is
,
if
*NL*
there
is
anything
you
do
not
like
in
him
at
first
sight
.
I
give
you
this
*NL*
warning
,
although
I
feel
sure
that
he
will
make
a
favourable
impression
*NL*
upon
you
.
Moreover
,
in
order
to
understand
any
man
one
must
be
*NL*
deliberate
and
careful
to
avoid
forming
prejudices
and
mistaken
ideas
,
*NL*
which
are
very
difficult
to
correct
and
get
over
afterwards
.
And
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
,
judging
by
many
indications
,
is
a
thoroughly
estimable
man
.
*NL*
At
his
first
visit
,
indeed
,
he
told
us
that
he
was
a
practical
man
,
but
*NL*
still
he
shares
,
as
he
expressed
it
,
many
of
the
convictions
`
of
our
*NL*
most
rising
generation
'
and
he
is
an
opponent
of
all
prejudices
.
He
*NL*
said
a
good
deal
more
,
for
he
seems
a
little
conceited
and
likes
to
be
*NL*
listened
to
,
but
this
is
scarcely
a
vice
.
I
,
of
course
,
understood
very
*NL*
little
of
it
,
but
Dounia
explained
to
me
that
,
though
he
is
not
a
man
*NL*
of
great
education
,
he
is
clever
and
seems
to
be
good-natured
.
You
know
*NL*
your
sister
's
character
,
Rodya
.
She
is
a
resolute
,
sensible
,
patient
and
*NL*
generous
girl
,
but
she
has
a
passionate
heart
,
as
I
know
very
well
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
there
is
no
great
love
either
on
his
side
,
or
on
hers
,
but
*NL*
Dounia
is
a
clever
girl
and
has
the
heart
of
an
angel
,
and
will
make
*NL*
it
her
duty
to
make
her
husband
happy
who
on
his
side
will
make
her
*NL*
happiness
his
care
.
Of
that
we
have
no
good
reason
to
doubt
,
though
it
*NL*
must
be
admitted
the
matter
has
been
arranged
in
great
haste
.
Besides
he
*NL*
is
a
man
of
great
prudence
and
he
will
see
,
to
be
sure
,
of
himself
,
that
*NL*
his
own
happiness
will
be
the
more
secure
,
the
happier
Dounia
is
with
*NL*
him
.
And
as
for
some
defects
of
character
,
for
some
habits
and
even
*NL*
certain
differences
of
opinion
--
which
indeed
are
inevitable
even
in
*NL*
the
happiest
marriages
--
Dounia
has
said
that
,
as
regards
all
that
,
she
*NL*
relies
on
herself
,
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
uneasy
about
,
and
*NL*
that
she
is
ready
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
,
if
only
their
future
*NL*
relationship
can
be
an
honourable
and
straightforward
one
.
He
struck
me
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
at
first
,
as
rather
abrupt
,
but
that
may
well
come
*NL*
from
his
being
an
outspoken
man
,
and
that
is
no
doubt
how
it
is
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
at
his
second
visit
,
after
he
had
received
Dounia
's
consent
,
*NL*
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
he
declared
that
before
making
*NL*
Dounia
's
acquaintance
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
a
girl
of
*NL*
good
reputation
,
without
dowry
and
,
above
all
,
one
who
had
experienced
*NL*
poverty
,
because
,
as
he
explained
,
a
man
ought
not
to
be
indebted
to
his
*NL*
wife
,
but
that
it
is
better
for
a
wife
to
look
upon
her
husband
as
her
*NL*
benefactor
.
I
must
add
that
he
expressed
it
more
nicely
and
politely
*NL*
than
I
have
done
,
for
I
have
forgotten
his
actual
phrases
and
only
*NL*
remember
the
meaning
.
And
,
besides
,
it
was
obviously
not
said
of
design
,
*NL*
but
slipped
out
in
the
heat
of
conversation
,
so
that
he
tried
afterwards
*NL*
to
correct
himself
and
smooth
it
over
,
but
all
the
same
it
did
strike
*NL*
me
as
somewhat
rude
,
and
I
said
so
afterwards
to
Dounia
.
But
Dounia
was
*NL*
vexed
,
and
answered
that
`
words
are
not
deeds
,
'
and
that
,
of
course
,
is
*NL*
perfectly
true
.
Dounia
did
not
sleep
all
night
before
she
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
,
and
,
thinking
that
I
was
asleep
,
she
got
out
of
bed
and
was
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
the
room
all
night
;
at
last
she
knelt
down
before
*NL*
the
ikon
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
and
in
the
morning
she
told
me
*NL*
that
she
had
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
mentioned
already
that
Pyotr
Petrovitch
is
just
setting
off
for
*NL*
Petersburg
,
where
he
has
a
great
deal
of
business
,
and
he
wants
to
open
*NL*
a
legal
bureau
.
He
has
been
occupied
for
many
years
in
conducting
civil
*NL*
and
commercial
litigation
,
and
only
the
other
day
he
won
an
important
*NL*
case
.
He
has
to
be
in
Petersburg
because
he
has
an
important
case
before
*NL*
the
Senate
.
So
,
Rodya
dear
,
he
may
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
you
,
in
*NL*
every
way
indeed
,
and
Dounia
and
I
have
agreed
that
from
this
very
day
*NL*
you
could
definitely
enter
upon
your
career
and
might
consider
that
*NL*
your
future
is
marked
out
and
assured
for
you
.
Oh
,
if
only
this
comes
to
*NL*
pass
!
This
would
be
such
a
benefit
that
we
could
only
look
upon
it
as
a
*NL*
providential
blessing
.
Dounia
is
dreaming
of
nothing
else
.
We
have
even
*NL*
ventured
already
to
drop
a
few
words
on
the
subject
to
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
He
was
cautious
in
his
answer
,
and
said
that
,
of
course
,
as
he
could
not
*NL*
get
on
without
a
secretary
,
it
would
be
better
to
be
paying
a
salary
to
*NL*
a
relation
than
to
a
stranger
,
if
only
the
former
were
fitted
for
the
*NL*
duties
-LRB-
as
though
there
could
be
doubt
of
your
being
fitted
!
-RRB-
but
then
*NL*
he
expressed
doubts
whether
your
studies
at
the
university
would
leave
*NL*
you
time
for
work
at
his
office
.
The
matter
dropped
for
the
time
,
but
*NL*
Dounia
is
thinking
of
nothing
else
now
.
She
has
been
in
a
sort
of
fever
*NL*
for
the
last
few
days
,
and
has
already
made
a
regular
plan
for
*NL*
your
becoming
in
the
end
an
associate
and
even
a
partner
in
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
's
business
,
which
might
well
be
,
seeing
that
you
are
a
*NL*
student
of
law
.
I
am
in
complete
agreement
with
her
,
Rodya
,
and
share
*NL*
all
her
plans
and
hopes
,
and
think
there
is
every
probability
of
*NL*
realising
them
.
And
in
spite
of
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
evasiveness
,
very
*NL*
natural
at
present
-LRB-
since
he
does
not
know
you
-RRB-
,
Dounia
is
firmly
*NL*
persuaded
that
she
will
gain
everything
by
her
good
influence
over
her
*NL*
future
husband
;
this
she
is
reckoning
upon
.
Of
course
we
are
careful
*NL*
not
to
talk
of
any
of
these
more
remote
plans
to
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
*NL*
especially
of
your
becoming
his
partner
.
He
is
a
practical
man
and
might
*NL*
take
this
very
coldly
,
it
might
all
seem
to
him
simply
a
day-dream
.
Nor
*NL*
has
either
Dounia
or
I
breathed
a
word
to
him
of
the
great
hopes
we
have
*NL*
of
his
helping
us
to
pay
for
your
university
studies
;
we
have
not
spoken
*NL*
of
it
in
the
first
place
,
because
it
will
come
to
pass
of
itself
,
*NL*
later
on
,
and
he
will
no
doubt
without
wasting
words
offer
to
do
it
of
*NL*
himself
,
-LRB-
as
though
he
could
refuse
Dounia
that
-RRB-
the
more
readily
since
*NL*
you
may
by
your
own
efforts
become
his
right
hand
in
the
office
,
and
*NL*
receive
this
assistance
not
as
a
charity
,
but
as
a
salary
earned
by
your
*NL*
own
work
.
Dounia
wants
to
arrange
it
all
like
this
and
I
quite
agree
*NL*
with
her
.
And
we
have
not
spoken
of
our
plans
for
another
reason
,
that
*NL*
is
,
because
I
particularly
wanted
you
to
feel
on
an
equal
footing
when
*NL*
you
first
meet
him
.
When
Dounia
spoke
to
him
with
enthusiasm
about
*NL*
you
,
he
answered
that
one
could
never
judge
of
a
man
without
seeing
*NL*
him
close
,
for
oneself
,
and
that
he
looked
forward
to
forming
his
own
*NL*
opinion
when
he
makes
your
acquaintance
.
Do
you
know
,
my
precious
*NL*
Rodya
,
I
think
that
perhaps
for
some
reasons
-LRB-
nothing
to
do
with
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
though
,
simply
for
my
own
personal
,
perhaps
old-womanish
,
*NL*
fancies
-RRB-
I
should
do
better
to
go
on
living
by
myself
,
apart
,
than
with
*NL*
them
,
after
the
wedding
.
I
am
convinced
that
he
will
be
generous
and
*NL*
delicate
enough
to
invite
me
and
to
urge
me
to
remain
with
my
daughter
*NL*
for
the
future
,
and
if
he
has
said
nothing
about
it
hitherto
,
it
is
*NL*
simply
because
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
;
but
I
shall
refuse
.
I
have
*NL*
noticed
more
than
once
in
my
life
that
husbands
do
n't
quite
get
on
with
*NL*
their
mothers-in-law
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
be
the
least
bit
in
anyone
's
*NL*
way
,
and
for
my
own
sake
,
too
,
would
rather
be
quite
independent
,
so
*NL*
long
as
I
have
a
crust
of
bread
of
my
own
,
and
such
children
as
you
and
*NL*
Dounia
.
If
possible
,
I
would
settle
somewhere
near
you
,
for
the
most
*NL*
joyful
piece
of
news
,
dear
Rodya
,
I
have
kept
for
the
end
of
my
letter
:
*NL*
know
then
,
my
dear
boy
,
that
we
may
,
perhaps
,
be
all
together
in
a
*NL*
very
short
time
and
may
embrace
one
another
again
after
a
separation
of
*NL*
almost
three
years
!
It
is
settled
_
for
certain
_
that
Dounia
and
I
are
to
*NL*
set
off
for
Petersburg
,
exactly
when
I
do
n't
know
,
but
very
,
very
soon
,
*NL*
possibly
in
a
week
.
It
all
depends
on
Pyotr
Petrovitch
who
will
let
us
*NL*
know
when
he
has
had
time
to
look
round
him
in
Petersburg
.
To
suit
his
*NL*
own
arrangements
he
is
anxious
to
have
the
ceremony
as
soon
as
possible
,
*NL*
even
before
the
fast
of
Our
Lady
,
if
it
could
be
managed
,
or
if
that
is
*NL*
too
soon
to
be
ready
,
immediately
after
.
Oh
,
with
what
happiness
I
shall
*NL*
press
you
to
my
heart
!
Dounia
is
all
excitement
at
the
joyful
thought
*NL*
of
seeing
you
,
she
said
one
day
in
joke
that
she
would
be
ready
to
marry
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
for
that
alone
.
She
is
an
angel
!
She
is
not
writing
*NL*
anything
to
you
now
,
and
has
only
told
me
to
write
that
she
has
so
much
,
*NL*
so
much
to
tell
you
that
she
is
not
going
to
take
up
her
pen
now
,
for
*NL*
a
few
lines
would
tell
you
nothing
,
and
it
would
only
mean
upsetting
*NL*
herself
;
she
bids
me
send
you
her
love
and
innumerable
kisses
.
But
*NL*
although
we
shall
be
meeting
so
soon
,
perhaps
I
shall
send
you
as
much
*NL*
money
as
I
can
in
a
day
or
two
.
Now
that
everyone
has
heard
that
Dounia
*NL*
is
to
marry
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
my
credit
has
suddenly
improved
and
I
know
*NL*
that
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
will
trust
me
now
even
to
seventy-five
roubles
*NL*
on
the
security
of
my
pension
,
so
that
perhaps
I
shall
be
able
to
send
*NL*
you
twenty-five
or
even
thirty
roubles
.
I
would
send
you
more
,
but
I
am
*NL*
uneasy
about
our
travelling
expenses
;
for
though
Pyotr
Petrovitch
has
*NL*
been
so
kind
as
to
undertake
part
of
the
expenses
of
the
journey
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
he
has
taken
upon
himself
the
conveyance
of
our
bags
and
big
*NL*
trunk
-LRB-
which
will
be
conveyed
through
some
acquaintances
of
his
-RRB-
,
we
*NL*
must
reckon
upon
some
expense
on
our
arrival
in
Petersburg
,
where
we
*NL*
ca
n't
be
left
without
a
halfpenny
,
at
least
for
the
first
few
days
.
But
*NL*
we
have
calculated
it
all
,
Dounia
and
I
,
to
the
last
penny
,
and
we
see
*NL*
that
the
journey
will
not
cost
very
much
.
It
is
only
ninety
versts
from
*NL*
us
to
the
railway
and
we
have
come
to
an
agreement
with
a
driver
we
*NL*
know
,
so
as
to
be
in
readiness
;
and
from
there
Dounia
and
I
can
travel
*NL*
quite
comfortably
third
class
.
So
that
I
may
very
likely
be
able
to
send
*NL*
to
you
not
twenty-five
,
but
thirty
roubles
.
But
enough
;
I
have
covered
*NL*
two
sheets
already
and
there
is
no
space
left
for
more
;
our
whole
*NL*
history
,
but
so
many
events
have
happened
!
And
now
,
my
precious
Rodya
,
*NL*
I
embrace
you
and
send
you
a
mother
's
blessing
till
we
meet
.
Love
Dounia
*NL*
your
sister
,
Rodya
;
love
her
as
she
loves
you
and
understand
that
she
*NL*
loves
you
beyond
everything
,
more
than
herself
.
She
is
an
angel
and
you
,
*NL*
Rodya
,
you
are
everything
to
us
--
our
one
hope
,
our
one
consolation
.
If
*NL*
only
you
are
happy
,
we
shall
be
happy
.
Do
you
still
say
your
prayers
,
*NL*
Rodya
,
and
believe
in
the
mercy
of
our
Creator
and
our
Redeemer
?
I
am
*NL*
afraid
in
my
heart
that
you
may
have
been
visited
by
the
new
spirit
of
*NL*
infidelity
that
is
abroad
to-day
;
If
it
is
so
,
I
pray
for
you
.
Remember
,
*NL*
dear
boy
,
how
in
your
childhood
,
when
your
father
was
living
,
you
used
*NL*
to
lisp
your
prayers
at
my
knee
,
and
how
happy
we
all
were
in
those
*NL*
days
.
Good-bye
,
till
we
meet
then
--
I
embrace
you
warmly
,
warmly
,
with
*NL*
many
kisses
.

PULCHERIA
RASKOLNIKOV
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
from
the
first
,
while
he
read
the
letter
,
Raskolnikov
's
face
was
*NL*
wet
with
tears
;
but
when
he
finished
it
,
his
face
was
pale
and
distorted
*NL*
and
a
bitter
,
wrathful
and
malignant
smile
was
on
his
lips
.
He
laid
his
*NL*
head
down
on
his
threadbare
dirty
pillow
and
pondered
,
pondered
a
long
*NL*
time
.
His
heart
was
beating
violently
,
and
his
brain
was
in
a
turmoil
.
*NL*
At
last
he
felt
cramped
and
stifled
in
the
little
yellow
room
that
was
*NL*
like
a
cupboard
or
a
box
.
His
eyes
and
his
mind
craved
for
space
.
He
*NL*
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
,
this
time
without
dread
of
meeting
*NL*
anyone
;
he
had
forgotten
his
dread
.
He
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
Vassilyevsky
Ostrov
,
walking
along
Vassilyevsky
Prospect
,
as
though
*NL*
hastening
on
some
business
,
but
he
walked
,
as
his
habit
was
,
without
*NL*
noticing
his
way
,
muttering
and
even
speaking
aloud
to
himself
,
to
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
the
passers-by
.
Many
of
them
took
him
to
be
drunk
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
's
letter
had
been
a
torture
to
him
,
but
as
regards
the
chief
*NL*
fact
in
it
,
he
had
felt
not
one
moment
's
hesitation
,
even
whilst
he
was
*NL*
reading
the
letter
.
The
essential
question
was
settled
,
and
irrevocably
*NL*
settled
,
in
his
mind
:
``
Never
such
a
marriage
while
I
am
alive
and
*NL*
Mr.
Luzhin
be
damned
!
''
``
The
thing
is
perfectly
clear
,
''
he
muttered
*NL*
to
himself
,
with
a
malignant
smile
anticipating
the
triumph
of
his
*NL*
decision
.
``
No
,
mother
,
no
,
Dounia
,
you
wo
n't
deceive
me
!
and
then
they
*NL*
apologise
for
not
asking
my
advice
and
for
taking
the
decision
without
*NL*
me
!
I
dare
say
!
They
imagine
it
is
arranged
now
and
ca
n't
be
broken
*NL*
off
;
but
we
will
see
whether
it
can
or
not
!
A
magnificent
excuse
:
*NL*
`
Pyotr
Petrovitch
is
such
a
busy
man
that
even
his
wedding
has
to
be
in
*NL*
post-haste
,
almost
by
express
.
'
No
,
Dounia
,
I
see
it
all
and
I
know
what
*NL*
you
want
to
say
to
me
;
and
I
know
too
what
you
were
thinking
about
,
when
*NL*
you
walked
up
and
down
all
night
,
and
what
your
prayers
were
like
before
*NL*
the
Holy
Mother
of
Kazan
who
stands
in
mother
's
bedroom
.
Bitter
is
*NL*
the
ascent
to
Golgotha
...
Hm
...
so
it
is
finally
settled
;
you
have
*NL*
determined
to
marry
a
sensible
business
man
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
one
*NL*
who
has
a
fortune
-LRB-
has
_
already
_
made
his
fortune
,
that
is
so
much
*NL*
more
solid
and
impressive
-RRB-
a
man
who
holds
two
government
posts
and
who
*NL*
shares
the
ideas
of
our
most
rising
generation
,
as
mother
writes
,
and
*NL*
who
_
seems
_
to
be
kind
,
as
Dounia
herself
observes
.
That
_
seems
_
beats
*NL*
everything
!
And
that
very
Dounia
for
that
very
'
_
seems
_
'
is
marrying
*NL*
him
!
Splendid
!
splendid
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
But
I
should
like
to
know
why
mother
has
written
to
me
about
`
our
*NL*
most
rising
generation
'
?
Simply
as
a
descriptive
touch
,
or
with
the
idea
*NL*
of
prepossessing
me
in
favour
of
Mr.
Luzhin
?
Oh
,
the
cunning
of
them
!
*NL*
I
should
like
to
know
one
thing
more
:
how
far
they
were
open
with
one
*NL*
another
that
day
and
night
and
all
this
time
since
?
Was
it
all
put
into
*NL*
_
words
_
,
or
did
both
understand
that
they
had
the
same
thing
at
heart
*NL*
and
in
their
minds
,
so
that
there
was
no
need
to
speak
of
it
aloud
,
and
*NL*
better
not
to
speak
of
it
.
Most
likely
it
was
partly
like
that
,
from
*NL*
mother
's
letter
it
's
evident
:
he
struck
her
as
rude
_
a
little
_
,
and
*NL*
mother
in
her
simplicity
took
her
observations
to
Dounia
.
And
she
was
*NL*
sure
to
be
vexed
and
`
answered
her
angrily
.
'
I
should
think
so
!
Who
*NL*
would
not
be
angered
when
it
was
quite
clear
without
any
naive
questions
*NL*
and
when
it
was
understood
that
it
was
useless
to
discuss
it
.
And
why
*NL*
does
she
write
to
me
,
`
love
Dounia
,
Rodya
,
and
she
loves
you
more
than
*NL*
herself
'
?
Has
she
a
secret
conscience-prick
at
sacrificing
her
daughter
*NL*
to
her
son
?
`
You
are
our
one
comfort
,
you
are
everything
to
us
.
'
Oh
,
*NL*
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
bitterness
grew
more
and
more
intense
,
and
if
he
had
happened
to
*NL*
meet
Mr.
Luzhin
at
the
moment
,
he
might
have
murdered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
yes
,
that
's
true
,
''
he
continued
,
pursuing
the
whirling
ideas
that
*NL*
chased
each
other
in
his
brain
,
``
it
is
true
that
`
it
needs
time
and
care
*NL*
to
get
to
know
a
man
,
'
but
there
is
no
mistake
about
Mr.
Luzhin
.
The
*NL*
chief
thing
is
he
is
'
a
man
of
business
and
_
seems
_
kind
,
'
that
was
*NL*
something
,
was
n't
it
,
to
send
the
bags
and
big
box
for
them
!
A
kind
man
,
*NL*
no
doubt
after
that
!
But
his
_
bride
_
and
her
mother
are
to
drive
in
a
*NL*
peasant
's
cart
covered
with
sacking
-LRB-
I
know
,
I
have
been
driven
in
*NL*
it
-RRB-
.
No
matter
!
It
is
only
ninety
versts
and
then
they
can
`
travel
very
*NL*
comfortably
,
third
class
,
'
for
a
thousand
versts
!
Quite
right
,
too
.
One
*NL*
must
cut
one
's
coat
according
to
one
's
cloth
,
but
what
about
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Luzhin
?
She
is
your
bride
...
And
you
must
be
aware
that
her
mother
has
*NL*
to
raise
money
on
her
pension
for
the
journey
.
To
be
sure
it
's
a
matter
*NL*
of
business
,
a
partnership
for
mutual
benefit
,
with
equal
shares
and
*NL*
expenses
;
--
food
and
drink
provided
,
but
pay
for
your
tobacco
.
The
*NL*
business
man
has
got
the
better
of
them
,
too
.
The
luggage
will
cost
less
*NL*
than
their
fares
and
very
likely
go
for
nothing
.
How
is
it
that
they
*NL*
do
n't
both
see
all
that
,
or
is
it
that
they
do
n't
want
to
see
?
And
*NL*
they
are
pleased
,
pleased
!
And
to
think
that
this
is
only
the
first
*NL*
blossoming
,
and
that
the
real
fruits
are
to
come
!
But
what
really
*NL*
matters
is
not
the
stinginess
,
is
not
the
meanness
,
but
the
_
tone
_
*NL*
of
the
whole
thing
.
For
that
will
be
the
tone
after
marriage
,
it
's
a
*NL*
foretaste
of
it
.
And
mother
too
,
why
should
she
be
so
lavish
?
What
will
*NL*
she
have
by
the
time
she
gets
to
Petersburg
?
Three
silver
roubles
or
*NL*
two
`
paper
ones
'
as
_
she
_
says
...
that
old
woman
...
hm
.
What
does
*NL*
she
expect
to
live
upon
in
Petersburg
afterwards
?
She
has
her
reasons
*NL*
already
for
guessing
that
she
_
could
not
_
live
with
Dounia
after
the
*NL*
marriage
,
even
for
the
first
few
months
.
The
good
man
has
no
doubt
let
*NL*
slip
something
on
that
subject
also
,
though
mother
would
deny
it
:
'
I
*NL*
shall
refuse
,
'
says
she
.
On
whom
is
she
reckoning
then
?
Is
she
counting
*NL*
on
what
is
left
of
her
hundred
and
twenty
roubles
of
pension
when
*NL*
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
's
debt
is
paid
?
She
knits
woollen
shawls
and
*NL*
embroiders
cuffs
,
ruining
her
old
eyes
.
And
all
her
shawls
do
n't
add
*NL*
more
than
twenty
roubles
a
year
to
her
hundred
and
twenty
,
I
know
*NL*
that
.
So
she
is
building
all
her
hopes
all
the
time
on
Mr.
Luzhin
's
*NL*
generosity
;
`
he
will
offer
it
of
himself
,
he
will
press
it
on
me
.
'
*NL*
You
may
wait
a
long
time
for
that
!
That
's
how
it
always
is
with
these
*NL*
Schilleresque
noble
hearts
;
till
the
last
moment
every
goose
is
a
swan
*NL*
with
them
,
till
the
last
moment
,
they
hope
for
the
best
and
will
see
*NL*
nothing
wrong
,
and
although
they
have
an
inkling
of
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
picture
,
yet
they
wo
n't
face
the
truth
till
they
are
forced
to
;
the
*NL*
very
thought
of
it
makes
them
shiver
;
they
thrust
the
truth
away
with
*NL*
both
hands
,
until
the
man
they
deck
out
in
false
colours
puts
a
fool
's
*NL*
cap
on
them
with
his
own
hands
.
I
should
like
to
know
whether
Mr.
Luzhin
*NL*
has
any
orders
of
merit
;
I
bet
he
has
the
Anna
in
his
buttonhole
and
*NL*
that
he
puts
it
on
when
he
goes
to
dine
with
contractors
or
merchants
.
*NL*
He
will
be
sure
to
have
it
for
his
wedding
,
too
!
Enough
of
him
,
confound
*NL*
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
...
mother
I
do
n't
wonder
at
,
it
's
like
her
,
God
bless
her
,
but
*NL*
how
could
Dounia
?
Dounia
darling
,
as
though
I
did
not
know
you
!
You
were
*NL*
nearly
twenty
when
I
saw
you
last
:
I
understood
you
then
.
Mother
writes
*NL*
that
`
Dounia
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
.
'
I
know
that
very
well
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
two
years
and
a
half
ago
,
and
for
the
last
two
and
a
half
*NL*
years
I
have
been
thinking
about
it
,
thinking
of
just
that
,
that
`
Dounia
*NL*
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
.
'
If
she
could
put
up
with
Mr.
Svidrigailov
*NL*
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
she
certainly
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
.
And
*NL*
now
mother
and
she
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
she
can
put
up
*NL*
with
Mr.
Luzhin
,
who
propounds
the
theory
of
the
superiority
of
*NL*
wives
raised
from
destitution
and
owing
everything
to
their
husband
's
*NL*
bounty
--
who
propounds
it
,
too
,
almost
at
the
first
interview
.
Granted
*NL*
that
he
`
let
it
slip
,
'
though
he
is
a
sensible
man
,
-LRB-
yet
maybe
it
*NL*
was
not
a
slip
at
all
,
but
he
meant
to
make
himself
clear
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
-RRB-
but
Dounia
,
Dounia
?
She
understands
the
man
,
of
course
,
but
*NL*
she
will
have
to
live
with
the
man
.
Why
!
she
'd
live
on
black
bread
*NL*
and
water
,
she
would
not
sell
her
soul
,
she
would
not
barter
her
moral
*NL*
freedom
for
comfort
;
she
would
not
barter
it
for
all
Schleswig-Holstein
,
*NL*
much
less
Mr.
Luzhin
's
money
.
No
,
Dounia
was
not
that
sort
when
I
knew
*NL*
her
and
...
she
is
still
the
same
,
of
course
!
Yes
,
there
's
no
denying
,
*NL*
the
Svidrigailovs
are
a
bitter
pill
!
It
's
a
bitter
thing
to
spend
one
's
*NL*
life
a
governess
in
the
provinces
for
two
hundred
roubles
,
but
I
know
*NL*
she
would
rather
be
a
nigger
on
a
plantation
or
a
Lett
with
a
German
*NL*
master
than
degrade
her
soul
,
and
her
moral
dignity
,
by
binding
herself
*NL*
for
ever
to
a
man
whom
she
does
not
respect
and
with
whom
she
has
*NL*
nothing
in
common
--
for
her
own
advantage
.
And
if
Mr.
Luzhin
had
been
of
*NL*
unalloyed
gold
,
or
one
huge
diamond
,
she
would
never
have
consented
to
*NL*
become
his
legal
concubine
.
Why
is
she
consenting
then
?
What
's
the
*NL*
point
of
it
?
What
's
the
answer
?
It
's
clear
enough
:
for
herself
,
for
her
*NL*
comfort
,
to
save
her
life
she
would
not
sell
herself
,
but
for
someone
*NL*
else
she
is
doing
it
!
For
one
she
loves
,
for
one
she
adores
,
she
will
*NL*
sell
herself
!
That
's
what
it
all
amounts
to
;
for
her
brother
,
for
her
*NL*
mother
,
she
will
sell
herself
!
She
will
sell
everything
!
In
such
cases
,
*NL*
`
we
overcome
our
moral
feeling
if
necessary
,
'
freedom
,
peace
,
conscience
*NL*
even
,
all
,
all
are
brought
into
the
market
.
Let
my
life
go
,
if
only
my
*NL*
dear
ones
may
be
happy
!
More
than
that
,
we
become
casuists
,
we
learn
*NL*
to
be
Jesuitical
and
for
a
time
maybe
we
can
soothe
ourselves
,
we
can
*NL*
persuade
ourselves
that
it
is
one
's
duty
for
a
good
object
.
That
's
just
*NL*
like
us
,
it
's
as
clear
as
daylight
.
It
's
clear
that
Rodion
Romanovitch
*NL*
Raskolnikov
is
the
central
figure
in
the
business
,
and
no
one
else
.
Oh
,
*NL*
yes
,
she
can
ensure
his
happiness
,
keep
him
in
the
university
,
make
him
*NL*
a
partner
in
the
office
,
make
his
whole
future
secure
;
perhaps
he
may
*NL*
even
be
a
rich
man
later
on
,
prosperous
,
respected
,
and
may
even
end
his
*NL*
life
a
famous
man
!
But
my
mother
?
It
's
all
Rodya
,
precious
Rodya
,
her
*NL*
first
born
!
For
such
a
son
who
would
not
sacrifice
such
a
daughter
!
Oh
,
*NL*
loving
,
over-partial
hearts
!
Why
,
for
his
sake
we
would
not
shrink
even
*NL*
from
Sonia
's
fate
.
Sonia
,
Sonia
Marmeladov
,
the
eternal
victim
so
long
*NL*
as
the
world
lasts
.
Have
you
taken
the
measure
of
your
sacrifice
,
both
*NL*
of
you
?
Is
it
right
?
Can
you
bear
it
?
Is
it
any
use
?
Is
there
sense
in
*NL*
it
?
And
let
me
tell
you
,
Dounia
,
Sonia
's
life
is
no
worse
than
life
with
*NL*
Mr.
Luzhin
.
`
There
can
be
no
question
of
love
,
'
mother
writes
.
And
what
*NL*
if
there
can
be
no
respect
either
,
if
on
the
contrary
there
is
aversion
,
*NL*
contempt
,
repulsion
,
what
then
?
So
you
will
have
to
`
keep
up
your
*NL*
appearance
,
'
too
.
Is
not
that
so
?
Do
you
understand
what
that
smartness
*NL*
means
?
Do
you
understand
that
the
Luzhin
smartness
is
just
the
same
*NL*
thing
as
Sonia
's
and
may
be
worse
,
viler
,
baser
,
because
in
your
case
,
*NL*
Dounia
,
it
's
a
bargain
for
luxuries
,
after
all
,
but
with
Sonia
it
's
*NL*
simply
a
question
of
starvation
.
It
has
to
be
paid
for
,
it
has
to
be
*NL*
paid
for
,
Dounia
,
this
smartness
.
And
what
if
it
's
more
than
you
can
*NL*
bear
afterwards
,
if
you
regret
it
?
The
bitterness
,
the
misery
,
the
*NL*
curses
,
the
tears
hidden
from
all
the
world
,
for
you
are
not
a
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
.
And
how
will
your
mother
feel
then
?
Even
now
she
is
uneasy
,
*NL*
she
is
worried
,
but
then
,
when
she
sees
it
all
clearly
?
And
I
?
Yes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
what
have
you
taken
me
for
?
I
wo
n't
have
your
sacrifice
,
Dounia
,
*NL*
I
wo
n't
have
it
,
mother
!
It
shall
not
be
,
so
long
as
I
am
alive
,
it
*NL*
shall
not
,
it
shall
not
!
I
wo
n't
accept
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
paused
in
his
reflection
and
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
not
be
?
But
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
prevent
it
?
You
'll
*NL*
forbid
it
?
And
what
right
have
you
?
What
can
you
promise
them
on
your
*NL*
side
to
give
you
such
a
right
?
Your
whole
life
,
your
whole
future
,
you
*NL*
will
devote
to
them
_
when
you
have
finished
your
studies
and
obtained
a
*NL*
post
_
?
Yes
,
we
have
heard
all
that
before
,
and
that
's
all
_
words
_
,
but
*NL*
now
?
Now
something
must
be
done
,
now
,
do
you
understand
that
?
And
*NL*
what
are
you
doing
now
?
You
are
living
upon
them
.
They
borrow
on
their
*NL*
hundred
roubles
pension
.
They
borrow
from
the
Svidrigailovs
.
How
are
*NL*
you
going
to
save
them
from
Svidrigailovs
,
from
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
*NL*
Vahrushin
,
oh
,
future
millionaire
Zeus
who
would
arrange
their
lives
for
*NL*
them
?
In
another
ten
years
?
In
another
ten
years
,
mother
will
be
blind
*NL*
with
knitting
shawls
,
maybe
with
weeping
too
.
She
will
be
worn
to
a
*NL*
shadow
with
fasting
;
and
my
sister
?
Imagine
for
a
moment
what
may
have
*NL*
become
of
your
sister
in
ten
years
?
What
may
happen
to
her
during
those
*NL*
ten
years
?
Can
you
fancy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
tortured
himself
,
fretting
himself
with
such
questions
,
and
*NL*
finding
a
kind
of
enjoyment
in
it
.
And
yet
all
these
questions
were
not
*NL*
new
ones
suddenly
confronting
him
,
they
were
old
familiar
aches
.
It
was
*NL*
long
since
they
had
first
begun
to
grip
and
rend
his
heart
.
Long
,
long
*NL*
ago
his
present
anguish
had
its
first
beginnings
;
it
had
waxed
and
*NL*
gathered
strength
,
it
had
matured
and
concentrated
,
until
it
had
taken
*NL*
the
form
of
a
fearful
,
frenzied
and
fantastic
question
,
which
tortured
*NL*
his
heart
and
mind
,
clamouring
insistently
for
an
answer
.
Now
his
*NL*
mother
's
letter
had
burst
on
him
like
a
thunderclap
.
It
was
clear
*NL*
that
he
must
not
now
suffer
passively
,
worrying
himself
over
unsolved
*NL*
questions
,
but
that
he
must
do
something
,
do
it
at
once
,
and
do
it
*NL*
quickly
.
Anyway
he
must
decide
on
something
,
or
else
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
throw
up
life
altogether
!
''
he
cried
suddenly
,
in
a
frenzy
--
``
accept
*NL*
one
's
lot
humbly
as
it
is
,
once
for
all
and
stifle
everything
in
*NL*
oneself
,
giving
up
all
claim
to
activity
,
life
and
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
,
sir
,
do
you
understand
what
it
means
when
you
have
*NL*
absolutely
nowhere
to
turn
?
''
Marmeladov
's
question
came
suddenly
into
*NL*
his
mind
,
``
for
every
man
must
have
somewhere
to
turn
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
sudden
start
;
another
thought
,
that
he
had
had
yesterday
,
*NL*
slipped
back
into
his
mind
.
But
he
did
not
start
at
the
thought
*NL*
recurring
to
him
,
for
he
knew
,
he
had
_
felt
beforehand
_
,
that
it
must
*NL*
come
back
,
he
was
expecting
it
;
besides
it
was
not
only
yesterday
's
*NL*
thought
.
The
difference
was
that
a
month
ago
,
yesterday
even
,
the
*NL*
thought
was
a
mere
dream
:
but
now
...
now
it
appeared
not
a
dream
at
all
,
*NL*
it
had
taken
a
new
menacing
and
quite
unfamiliar
shape
,
and
he
suddenly
*NL*
became
aware
of
this
himself
...
He
felt
a
hammering
in
his
head
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
darkness
before
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
hurriedly
,
he
was
searching
for
something
.
He
wanted
*NL*
to
sit
down
and
was
looking
for
a
seat
;
he
was
walking
along
the
K
--
*NL*
Boulevard
.
There
was
a
seat
about
a
hundred
paces
in
front
of
him
.
He
*NL*
walked
towards
it
as
fast
he
could
;
but
on
the
way
he
met
with
a
little
*NL*
adventure
which
absorbed
all
his
attention
.
Looking
for
the
seat
,
he
had
*NL*
noticed
a
woman
walking
some
twenty
paces
in
front
of
him
,
but
at
first
*NL*
he
took
no
more
notice
of
her
than
of
other
objects
that
crossed
his
*NL*
path
.
It
had
happened
to
him
many
times
going
home
not
to
notice
the
*NL*
road
by
which
he
was
going
,
and
he
was
accustomed
to
walk
like
that
.
But
*NL*
there
was
at
first
sight
something
so
strange
about
the
woman
in
front
*NL*
of
him
,
that
gradually
his
attention
was
riveted
upon
her
,
at
first
*NL*
reluctantly
and
,
as
it
were
,
resentfully
,
and
then
more
and
more
*NL*
intently
.
He
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
find
out
what
it
was
that
was
so
*NL*
strange
about
the
woman
.
In
the
first
place
,
she
appeared
to
be
a
girl
*NL*
quite
young
,
and
she
was
walking
in
the
great
heat
bareheaded
and
with
*NL*
no
parasol
or
gloves
,
waving
her
arms
about
in
an
absurd
way
.
She
had
*NL*
on
a
dress
of
some
light
silky
material
,
but
put
on
strangely
awry
,
not
*NL*
properly
hooked
up
,
and
torn
open
at
the
top
of
the
skirt
,
close
to
the
*NL*
waist
:
a
great
piece
was
rent
and
hanging
loose
.
A
little
kerchief
was
*NL*
flung
about
her
bare
throat
,
but
lay
slanting
on
one
side
.
The
girl
was
*NL*
walking
unsteadily
,
too
,
stumbling
and
staggering
from
side
to
side
.
She
*NL*
drew
Raskolnikov
's
whole
attention
at
last
.
He
overtook
the
girl
at
the
*NL*
seat
,
but
,
on
reaching
it
,
she
dropped
down
on
it
,
in
the
corner
;
*NL*
she
let
her
head
sink
on
the
back
of
the
seat
and
closed
her
eyes
,
*NL*
apparently
in
extreme
exhaustion
.
Looking
at
her
closely
,
he
saw
at
once
*NL*
that
she
was
completely
drunk
.
It
was
a
strange
and
shocking
sight
.
He
*NL*
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
not
mistaken
.
He
saw
before
him
the
*NL*
face
of
a
quite
young
,
fair-haired
girl
--
sixteen
,
perhaps
not
more
than
*NL*
fifteen
,
years
old
,
pretty
little
face
,
but
flushed
and
heavy
looking
*NL*
and
,
as
it
were
,
swollen
.
The
girl
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
she
was
*NL*
doing
;
she
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
,
lifting
it
indecorously
,
and
*NL*
showed
every
sign
of
being
unconscious
that
she
was
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
did
not
sit
down
,
but
he
felt
unwilling
to
leave
her
,
*NL*
and
stood
facing
her
in
perplexity
.
This
boulevard
was
never
much
*NL*
frequented
;
and
now
,
at
two
o'clock
,
in
the
stifling
heat
,
it
was
quite
*NL*
deserted
.
And
yet
on
the
further
side
of
the
boulevard
,
about
fifteen
*NL*
paces
away
,
a
gentleman
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
.
He
,
*NL*
too
,
would
apparently
have
liked
to
approach
the
girl
with
some
object
*NL*
of
his
own
.
He
,
too
,
had
probably
seen
her
in
the
distance
and
had
*NL*
followed
her
,
but
found
Raskolnikov
in
his
way
.
He
looked
angrily
at
*NL*
him
,
though
he
tried
to
escape
his
notice
,
and
stood
impatiently
biding
*NL*
his
time
,
till
the
unwelcome
man
in
rags
should
have
moved
away
.
His
*NL*
intentions
were
unmistakable
.
The
gentleman
was
a
plump
,
thickly-set
*NL*
man
,
about
thirty
,
fashionably
dressed
,
with
a
high
colour
,
red
lips
and
*NL*
moustaches
.
Raskolnikov
felt
furious
;
he
had
a
sudden
longing
to
insult
*NL*
this
fat
dandy
in
some
way
.
He
left
the
girl
for
a
moment
and
walked
*NL*
towards
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
You
Svidrigailov
!
What
do
you
want
here
?
''
he
shouted
,
clenching
*NL*
his
fists
and
laughing
,
spluttering
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
the
gentleman
asked
sternly
,
scowling
in
haughty
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
away
,
that
's
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
,
you
low
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
cane
.
Raskolnikov
rushed
at
him
with
his
fists
,
without
*NL*
reflecting
that
the
stout
gentleman
was
a
match
for
two
men
like
*NL*
himself
.
But
at
that
instant
someone
seized
him
from
behind
,
and
a
*NL*
police
constable
stood
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
gentlemen
,
no
fighting
,
please
,
in
a
public
place
.
What
*NL*
do
you
want
?
Who
are
you
?
''
he
asked
Raskolnikov
sternly
,
noticing
his
*NL*
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
at
him
intently
.
He
had
a
straight-forward
,
sensible
,
*NL*
soldierly
face
,
with
grey
moustaches
and
whiskers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
just
the
man
I
want
,
''
Raskolnikov
cried
,
catching
at
his
arm
.
*NL*
``
I
am
a
student
,
Raskolnikov
...
You
may
as
well
know
that
too
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
addressing
the
gentleman
,
``
come
along
,
I
have
something
to
show
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
the
policeman
by
the
hand
he
drew
him
towards
the
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
hopelessly
drunk
,
and
she
has
just
come
down
the
boulevard
.
*NL*
There
is
no
telling
who
and
what
she
is
,
she
does
not
look
like
a
*NL*
professional
.
It
's
more
likely
she
has
been
given
drink
and
deceived
*NL*
somewhere
...
for
the
first
time
...
you
understand
?
and
they
've
put
her
*NL*
out
into
the
street
like
that
.
Look
at
the
way
her
dress
is
torn
,
and
*NL*
the
way
it
has
been
put
on
:
she
has
been
dressed
by
somebody
,
she
has
*NL*
not
dressed
herself
,
and
dressed
by
unpractised
hands
,
by
a
man
's
hands
;
*NL*
that
's
evident
.
And
now
look
there
:
I
do
n't
know
that
dandy
with
whom
I
*NL*
was
going
to
fight
,
I
see
him
for
the
first
time
,
but
he
,
too
,
has
seen
*NL*
her
on
the
road
,
just
now
,
drunk
,
not
knowing
what
she
is
doing
,
and
now
*NL*
he
is
very
eager
to
get
hold
of
her
,
to
get
her
away
somewhere
while
she
*NL*
is
in
this
state
...
that
's
certain
,
believe
me
,
I
am
not
wrong
.
I
saw
*NL*
him
myself
watching
her
and
following
her
,
but
I
prevented
him
,
and
he
*NL*
is
just
waiting
for
me
to
go
away
.
Now
he
has
walked
away
a
little
,
and
*NL*
is
standing
still
,
pretending
to
make
a
cigarette
...
Think
how
can
we
*NL*
keep
her
out
of
his
hands
,
and
how
are
we
to
get
her
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
policeman
saw
it
all
in
a
flash
.
The
stout
gentleman
was
easy
to
*NL*
understand
,
he
turned
to
consider
the
girl
.
The
policeman
bent
over
to
*NL*
examine
her
more
closely
,
and
his
face
worked
with
genuine
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
pity
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
--
``
why
,
she
is
quite
a
*NL*
child
!
She
has
been
deceived
,
you
can
see
that
at
once
.
Listen
,
lady
,
''
*NL*
he
began
addressing
her
,
``
where
do
you
live
?
''
The
girl
opened
her
weary
*NL*
and
sleepy-looking
eyes
,
gazed
blankly
at
the
speaker
and
waved
her
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
feeling
in
his
pocket
and
finding
twenty
*NL*
copecks
,
``
here
,
call
a
cab
and
tell
him
to
drive
her
to
her
address
.
The
*NL*
only
thing
is
to
find
out
her
address
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missy
,
missy
!
''
the
policeman
began
again
,
taking
the
money
.
``
I
'll
fetch
*NL*
you
a
cab
and
take
you
home
myself
.
Where
shall
I
take
you
,
eh
?
Where
do
*NL*
you
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
They
wo
n't
let
me
alone
,
''
the
girl
muttered
,
and
once
more
*NL*
waved
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
ach
,
how
shocking
!
It
's
shameful
,
missy
,
it
's
a
shame
!
''
He
shook
*NL*
his
head
again
,
shocked
,
sympathetic
and
indignant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
difficult
job
,
''
the
policeman
said
to
Raskolnikov
,
and
as
he
*NL*
did
so
,
he
looked
him
up
and
down
in
a
rapid
glance
.
He
,
too
,
must
have
*NL*
seemed
a
strange
figure
to
him
:
dressed
in
rags
and
handing
him
money
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
meet
her
far
from
here
?
''
he
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
she
was
walking
in
front
of
me
,
staggering
,
just
here
,
in
*NL*
the
boulevard
.
She
only
just
reached
the
seat
and
sank
down
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
shameful
things
that
are
done
in
the
world
nowadays
,
God
have
*NL*
mercy
on
us
!
An
innocent
creature
like
that
,
drunk
already
!
She
has
been
*NL*
deceived
,
that
's
a
sure
thing
.
See
how
her
dress
has
been
torn
too
...
*NL*
Ah
,
the
vice
one
sees
nowadays
!
And
as
likely
as
not
she
belongs
to
*NL*
gentlefolk
too
,
poor
ones
maybe
...
There
are
many
like
that
nowadays
.
*NL*
She
looks
refined
,
too
,
as
though
she
were
a
lady
,
''
and
he
bent
over
her
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
he
had
daughters
growing
up
like
that
,
``
looking
like
ladies
and
*NL*
refined
''
with
pretensions
to
gentility
and
smartness
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chief
thing
is
,
''
Raskolnikov
persisted
,
``
to
keep
her
out
of
this
*NL*
scoundrel
's
hands
!
Why
should
he
outrage
her
!
It
's
as
clear
as
day
what
*NL*
he
is
after
;
ah
,
the
brute
,
he
is
not
moving
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
spoke
aloud
and
pointed
to
him
.
The
gentleman
heard
him
,
*NL*
and
seemed
about
to
fly
into
a
rage
again
,
but
thought
better
of
it
,
and
*NL*
confined
himself
to
a
contemptuous
look
.
He
then
walked
slowly
another
*NL*
ten
paces
away
and
again
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
her
out
of
his
hands
we
can
,
''
said
the
constable
thoughtfully
,
*NL*
``
if
only
she
'd
tell
us
where
to
take
her
,
but
as
it
is
...
Missy
,
hey
,
*NL*
missy
!
''
he
bent
over
her
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
fully
all
of
a
sudden
,
looked
at
him
intently
,
as
*NL*
though
realising
something
,
got
up
from
the
seat
and
walked
away
in
the
*NL*
direction
from
which
she
had
come
.
``
Oh
shameful
wretches
,
they
wo
n't
let
*NL*
me
alone
!
''
she
said
,
waving
her
hand
again
.
She
walked
quickly
,
though
*NL*
staggering
as
before
.
The
dandy
followed
her
,
but
along
another
avenue
,
*NL*
keeping
his
eye
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
anxious
,
I
wo
n't
let
him
have
her
,
''
the
policeman
said
*NL*
resolutely
,
and
he
set
off
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
vice
one
sees
nowadays
!
''
he
repeated
aloud
,
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
something
seemed
to
sting
Raskolnikov
;
in
an
instant
a
*NL*
complete
revulsion
of
feeling
came
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
here
!
''
he
shouted
after
the
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
be
!
What
is
it
to
do
with
you
?
Let
her
go
!
Let
him
amuse
*NL*
himself
.
''
He
pointed
at
the
dandy
,
``
What
is
it
to
do
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
policeman
was
bewildered
,
and
stared
at
him
open-eyed
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
ejaculated
the
policeman
,
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
,
and
he
*NL*
walked
after
the
dandy
and
the
girl
,
probably
taking
Raskolnikov
for
a
*NL*
madman
or
something
even
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
carried
off
my
twenty
copecks
,
''
Raskolnikov
murmured
angrily
*NL*
when
he
was
left
alone
.
``
Well
,
let
him
take
as
much
from
the
other
*NL*
fellow
to
allow
him
to
have
the
girl
and
so
let
it
end
.
And
why
did
I
*NL*
want
to
interfere
?
Is
it
for
me
to
help
?
Have
I
any
right
to
help
?
Let
*NL*
them
devour
each
other
alive
--
what
is
to
me
?
How
did
I
dare
to
give
him
*NL*
twenty
copecks
?
Were
they
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
those
strange
words
he
felt
very
wretched
.
He
sat
down
on
*NL*
the
deserted
seat
.
His
thoughts
strayed
aimlessly
...
He
found
it
hard
*NL*
to
fix
his
mind
on
anything
at
that
moment
.
He
longed
to
forget
himself
*NL*
altogether
,
to
forget
everything
,
and
then
to
wake
up
and
begin
life
*NL*
anew
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
!
''
he
said
,
looking
at
the
empty
corner
where
she
had
*NL*
sat
--
``
She
will
come
to
herself
and
weep
,
and
then
her
mother
will
find
*NL*
out
...
She
will
give
her
a
beating
,
a
horrible
,
shameful
beating
and
*NL*
then
maybe
,
turn
her
out
of
doors
...
And
even
if
she
does
not
,
the
*NL*
Darya
Frantsovnas
will
get
wind
of
it
,
and
the
girl
will
soon
be
*NL*
slipping
out
on
the
sly
here
and
there
.
Then
there
will
be
the
hospital
*NL*
directly
-LRB-
that
's
always
the
luck
of
those
girls
with
respectable
*NL*
mothers
,
who
go
wrong
on
the
sly
-RRB-
and
then
...
again
the
hospital
...
*NL*
drink
...
the
taverns
...
and
more
hospital
,
in
two
or
three
years
--
a
*NL*
wreck
,
and
her
life
over
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
...
Have
not
I
seen
*NL*
cases
like
that
?
And
how
have
they
been
brought
to
it
?
Why
,
they
've
all
*NL*
come
to
it
like
that
.
Ugh
!
But
what
does
it
matter
?
That
's
as
it
should
*NL*
be
,
they
tell
us
.
A
certain
percentage
,
they
tell
us
,
must
every
year
*NL*
go
...
that
way
...
to
the
devil
,
I
suppose
,
so
that
the
rest
may
remain
*NL*
chaste
,
and
not
be
interfered
with
.
A
percentage
!
What
splendid
words
*NL*
they
have
;
they
are
so
scientific
,
so
consolatory
...
Once
you
've
said
*NL*
`
percentage
'
there
's
nothing
more
to
worry
about
.
If
we
had
any
other
*NL*
word
...
maybe
we
might
feel
more
uneasy
...
But
what
if
Dounia
were
one
*NL*
of
the
percentage
!
Of
another
one
if
not
that
one
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
am
I
going
?
''
he
thought
suddenly
.
``
Strange
,
I
came
out
for
*NL*
something
.
As
soon
as
I
had
read
the
letter
I
came
out
...
I
was
going
*NL*
to
Vassilyevsky
Ostrov
,
to
Razumihin
.
That
's
what
it
was
...
now
I
*NL*
remember
.
What
for
,
though
?
And
what
put
the
idea
of
going
to
Razumihin
*NL*
into
my
head
just
now
?
That
's
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
at
himself
.
Razumihin
was
one
of
his
old
comrades
at
the
*NL*
university
.
It
was
remarkable
that
Raskolnikov
had
hardly
any
friends
at
*NL*
the
university
;
he
kept
aloof
from
everyone
,
went
to
see
no
one
,
and
did
*NL*
not
welcome
anyone
who
came
to
see
him
,
and
indeed
everyone
soon
gave
*NL*
him
up
.
He
took
no
part
in
the
students
'
gatherings
,
amusements
or
*NL*
conversations
.
He
worked
with
great
intensity
without
sparing
himself
,
*NL*
and
he
was
respected
for
this
,
but
no
one
liked
him
.
He
was
very
poor
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
sort
of
haughty
pride
and
reserve
about
him
,
as
though
*NL*
he
were
keeping
something
to
himself
.
He
seemed
to
some
of
his
comrades
*NL*
to
look
down
upon
them
all
as
children
,
as
though
he
were
superior
in
*NL*
development
,
knowledge
and
convictions
,
as
though
their
beliefs
and
*NL*
interests
were
beneath
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Razumihin
he
had
got
on
,
or
,
at
least
,
he
was
more
unreserved
and
*NL*
communicative
with
him
.
Indeed
it
was
impossible
to
be
on
any
other
*NL*
terms
with
Razumihin
.
He
was
an
exceptionally
good-humoured
and
candid
*NL*
youth
,
good-natured
to
the
point
of
simplicity
,
though
both
depth
and
*NL*
dignity
lay
concealed
under
that
simplicity
.
The
better
of
his
comrades
*NL*
understood
this
,
and
all
were
fond
of
him
.
He
was
extremely
intelligent
,
*NL*
though
he
was
certainly
rather
a
simpleton
at
times
.
He
was
of
striking
*NL*
appearance
--
tall
,
thin
,
blackhaired
and
always
badly
shaved
.
He
was
*NL*
sometimes
uproarious
and
was
reputed
to
be
of
great
physical
strength
.
*NL*
One
night
,
when
out
in
a
festive
company
,
he
had
with
one
blow
laid
*NL*
a
gigantic
policeman
on
his
back
.
There
was
no
limit
to
his
drinking
*NL*
powers
,
but
he
could
abstain
from
drink
altogether
;
he
sometimes
went
*NL*
too
far
in
his
pranks
;
but
he
could
do
without
pranks
altogether
.
*NL*
Another
thing
striking
about
Razumihin
,
no
failure
distressed
him
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
as
though
no
unfavourable
circumstances
could
crush
him
.
He
*NL*
could
lodge
anywhere
,
and
bear
the
extremes
of
cold
and
hunger
.
He
was
*NL*
very
poor
,
and
kept
himself
entirely
on
what
he
could
earn
by
work
of
*NL*
one
sort
or
another
.
He
knew
of
no
end
of
resources
by
which
to
earn
*NL*
money
.
He
spent
one
whole
winter
without
lighting
his
stove
,
and
used
to
*NL*
declare
that
he
liked
it
better
,
because
one
slept
more
soundly
in
*NL*
the
cold
.
For
the
present
he
,
too
,
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
the
*NL*
university
,
but
it
was
only
for
a
time
,
and
he
was
working
with
all
his
*NL*
might
to
save
enough
to
return
to
his
studies
again
.
Raskolnikov
had
*NL*
not
been
to
see
him
for
the
last
four
months
,
and
Razumihin
did
not
even
*NL*
know
his
address
.
About
two
months
before
,
they
had
met
in
the
street
,
*NL*
but
Raskolnikov
had
turned
away
and
even
crossed
to
the
other
side
that
*NL*
he
might
not
be
observed
.
And
though
Razumihin
noticed
him
,
he
passed
*NL*
him
by
,
as
he
did
not
want
to
annoy
him
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
've
been
meaning
lately
to
go
to
Razumihin
's
to
ask
for
*NL*
work
,
to
ask
him
to
get
me
lessons
or
something
...
''
Raskolnikov
thought
,
*NL*
``
but
what
help
can
he
be
to
me
now
?
Suppose
he
gets
me
lessons
,
suppose
*NL*
he
shares
his
last
farthing
with
me
,
if
he
has
any
farthings
,
so
that
*NL*
I
could
get
some
boots
and
make
myself
tidy
enough
to
give
lessons
...
*NL*
hm
...
Well
and
what
then
?
What
shall
I
do
with
the
few
coppers
I
*NL*
earn
?
That
's
not
what
I
want
now
.
It
's
really
absurd
for
me
to
go
to
*NL*
Razumihin
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
why
he
was
now
going
to
Razumihin
agitated
him
even
more
*NL*
than
he
was
himself
aware
;
he
kept
uneasily
seeking
for
some
sinister
*NL*
significance
in
this
apparently
ordinary
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
I
have
expected
to
set
it
all
straight
and
to
find
a
way
out
by
*NL*
means
of
Razumihin
alone
?
''
he
asked
himself
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pondered
and
rubbed
his
forehead
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
after
long
*NL*
musing
,
suddenly
,
as
if
it
were
spontaneously
and
by
chance
,
a
fantastic
*NL*
thought
came
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
to
Razumihin
's
,
''
he
said
all
at
once
,
calmly
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
reached
a
final
determination
.
``
I
shall
go
to
Razumihin
's
of
course
,
*NL*
but
...
not
now
.
I
shall
go
to
him
...
on
the
next
day
after
It
,
when
It
*NL*
will
be
over
and
everything
will
begin
afresh
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
he
realised
what
he
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
It
,
''
he
shouted
,
jumping
up
from
the
seat
,
``
but
is
It
really
*NL*
going
to
happen
?
Is
it
possible
it
really
will
happen
?
''
He
left
the
*NL*
seat
,
and
went
off
almost
at
a
run
;
he
meant
to
turn
back
,
homewards
,
*NL*
but
the
thought
of
going
home
suddenly
filled
him
with
intense
loathing
;
*NL*
in
that
hole
,
in
that
awful
little
cupboard
of
his
,
all
_
this
_
had
for
a
*NL*
month
past
been
growing
up
in
him
;
and
he
walked
on
at
random
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
nervous
shudder
had
passed
into
a
fever
that
made
him
feel
*NL*
shivering
;
in
spite
of
the
heat
he
felt
cold
.
With
a
kind
of
effort
he
*NL*
began
almost
unconsciously
,
from
some
inner
craving
,
to
stare
at
all
*NL*
the
objects
before
him
,
as
though
looking
for
something
to
distract
his
*NL*
attention
;
but
he
did
not
succeed
,
and
kept
dropping
every
moment
into
*NL*
brooding
.
When
with
a
start
he
lifted
his
head
again
and
looked
round
,
*NL*
he
forgot
at
once
what
he
had
just
been
thinking
about
and
even
where
he
*NL*
was
going
.
In
this
way
he
walked
right
across
Vassilyevsky
Ostrov
,
came
*NL*
out
on
to
the
Lesser
Neva
,
crossed
the
bridge
and
turned
towards
the
*NL*
islands
.
The
greenness
and
freshness
were
at
first
restful
to
his
weary
*NL*
eyes
after
the
dust
of
the
town
and
the
huge
houses
that
hemmed
him
in
*NL*
and
weighed
upon
him
.
Here
there
were
no
taverns
,
no
stifling
closeness
,
*NL*
no
stench
.
But
soon
these
new
pleasant
sensations
passed
into
morbid
*NL*
irritability
.
Sometimes
he
stood
still
before
a
brightly
painted
summer
*NL*
villa
standing
among
green
foliage
,
he
gazed
through
the
fence
,
he
saw
*NL*
in
the
distance
smartly
dressed
women
on
the
verandahs
and
balconies
,
*NL*
and
children
running
in
the
gardens
.
The
flowers
especially
caught
his
*NL*
attention
;
he
gazed
at
them
longer
than
at
anything
.
He
was
met
,
too
,
by
*NL*
luxurious
carriages
and
by
men
and
women
on
horseback
;
he
watched
them
*NL*
with
curious
eyes
and
forgot
about
them
before
they
had
vanished
from
*NL*
his
sight
.
Once
he
stood
still
and
counted
his
money
;
he
found
he
had
*NL*
thirty
copecks
.
``
Twenty
to
the
policeman
,
three
to
Nastasya
for
the
*NL*
letter
,
so
I
must
have
given
forty-seven
or
fifty
to
the
Marmeladovs
*NL*
yesterday
,
''
he
thought
,
reckoning
it
up
for
some
unknown
reason
,
but
he
*NL*
soon
forgot
with
what
object
he
had
taken
the
money
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
He
recalled
it
on
passing
an
eating-house
or
tavern
,
and
felt
that
he
*NL*
was
hungry
...
Going
into
the
tavern
he
drank
a
glass
of
vodka
and
ate
a
*NL*
pie
of
some
sort
.
He
finished
eating
it
as
he
walked
away
.
It
was
a
long
*NL*
while
since
he
had
taken
vodka
and
it
had
an
effect
upon
him
at
once
,
*NL*
though
he
only
drank
a
wineglassful
.
His
legs
felt
suddenly
heavy
and
*NL*
a
great
drowsiness
came
upon
him
.
He
turned
homewards
,
but
reaching
*NL*
Petrovsky
Ostrov
he
stopped
completely
exhausted
,
turned
off
the
road
*NL*
into
the
bushes
,
sank
down
upon
the
grass
and
instantly
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
morbid
condition
of
the
brain
,
dreams
often
have
a
singular
*NL*
actuality
,
vividness
,
and
extraordinary
semblance
of
reality
.
At
times
*NL*
monstrous
images
are
created
,
but
the
setting
and
the
whole
picture
are
*NL*
so
truth-like
and
filled
with
details
so
delicate
,
so
unexpectedly
,
but
*NL*
so
artistically
consistent
,
that
the
dreamer
,
were
he
an
artist
like
*NL*
Pushkin
or
Turgenev
even
,
could
never
have
invented
them
in
the
waking
*NL*
state
.
Such
sick
dreams
always
remain
long
in
the
memory
and
make
a
*NL*
powerful
impression
on
the
overwrought
and
deranged
nervous
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
a
fearful
dream
.
He
dreamt
he
was
back
in
his
childhood
*NL*
in
the
little
town
of
his
birth
.
He
was
a
child
about
seven
years
old
,
*NL*
walking
into
the
country
with
his
father
on
the
evening
of
a
holiday
.
It
*NL*
was
a
grey
and
heavy
day
,
the
country
was
exactly
as
he
remembered
it
;
*NL*
indeed
he
recalled
it
far
more
vividly
in
his
dream
than
he
had
done
in
*NL*
memory
.
The
little
town
stood
on
a
level
flat
as
bare
as
the
hand
,
not
*NL*
even
a
willow
near
it
;
only
in
the
far
distance
,
a
copse
lay
,
a
dark
*NL*
blur
on
the
very
edge
of
the
horizon
.
A
few
paces
beyond
the
last
market
*NL*
garden
stood
a
tavern
,
a
big
tavern
,
which
had
always
aroused
in
him
a
*NL*
feeling
of
aversion
,
even
of
fear
,
when
he
walked
by
it
with
his
father
.
*NL*
There
was
always
a
crowd
there
,
always
shouting
,
laughter
and
abuse
,
*NL*
hideous
hoarse
singing
and
often
fighting
.
Drunken
and
horrible-looking
*NL*
figures
were
hanging
about
the
tavern
.
He
used
to
cling
close
to
his
*NL*
father
,
trembling
all
over
when
he
met
them
.
Near
the
tavern
the
road
*NL*
became
a
dusty
track
,
the
dust
of
which
was
always
black
.
It
was
a
*NL*
winding
road
,
and
about
a
hundred
paces
further
on
,
it
turned
to
the
*NL*
right
to
the
graveyard
.
In
the
middle
of
the
graveyard
stood
a
stone
*NL*
church
with
a
green
cupola
where
he
used
to
go
to
mass
two
or
three
*NL*
times
a
year
with
his
father
and
mother
,
when
a
service
was
held
in
*NL*
memory
of
his
grandmother
,
who
had
long
been
dead
,
and
whom
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
.
On
these
occasions
they
used
to
take
on
a
white
dish
tied
up
in
a
*NL*
table
napkin
a
special
sort
of
rice
pudding
with
raisins
stuck
in
it
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
a
cross
.
He
loved
that
church
,
the
old-fashioned
,
unadorned
*NL*
ikons
and
the
old
priest
with
the
shaking
head
.
Near
his
grandmother
's
*NL*
grave
,
which
was
marked
by
a
stone
,
was
the
little
grave
of
his
younger
*NL*
brother
who
had
died
at
six
months
old
.
He
did
not
remember
him
at
all
,
*NL*
but
he
had
been
told
about
his
little
brother
,
and
whenever
he
visited
*NL*
the
graveyard
he
used
religiously
and
reverently
to
cross
himself
and
*NL*
to
bow
down
and
kiss
the
little
grave
.
And
now
he
dreamt
that
he
was
*NL*
walking
with
his
father
past
the
tavern
on
the
way
to
the
graveyard
;
he
*NL*
was
holding
his
father
's
hand
and
looking
with
dread
at
the
tavern
.
A
*NL*
peculiar
circumstance
attracted
his
attention
:
there
seemed
to
be
*NL*
some
kind
of
festivity
going
on
,
there
were
crowds
of
gaily
dressed
*NL*
townspeople
,
peasant
women
,
their
husbands
,
and
riff-raff
of
all
sorts
,
*NL*
all
singing
and
all
more
or
less
drunk
.
Near
the
entrance
of
the
tavern
*NL*
stood
a
cart
,
but
a
strange
cart
.
It
was
one
of
those
big
carts
usually
*NL*
drawn
by
heavy
cart-horses
and
laden
with
casks
of
wine
or
other
heavy
*NL*
goods
.
He
always
liked
looking
at
those
great
cart-horses
,
with
their
*NL*
long
manes
,
thick
legs
,
and
slow
even
pace
,
drawing
along
a
perfect
*NL*
mountain
with
no
appearance
of
effort
,
as
though
it
were
easier
going
*NL*
with
a
load
than
without
it
.
But
now
,
strange
to
say
,
in
the
shafts
of
*NL*
such
a
cart
he
saw
a
thin
little
sorrel
beast
,
one
of
those
peasants
'
*NL*
nags
which
he
had
often
seen
straining
their
utmost
under
a
heavy
load
*NL*
of
wood
or
hay
,
especially
when
the
wheels
were
stuck
in
the
mud
or
in
*NL*
a
rut
.
And
the
peasants
would
beat
them
so
cruelly
,
sometimes
even
*NL*
about
the
nose
and
eyes
,
and
he
felt
so
sorry
,
so
sorry
for
them
that
*NL*
he
almost
cried
,
and
his
mother
always
used
to
take
him
away
from
the
*NL*
window
.
All
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
great
uproar
of
shouting
,
singing
*NL*
and
the
balalaika
,
and
from
the
tavern
a
number
of
big
and
very
drunken
*NL*
peasants
came
out
,
wearing
red
and
blue
shirts
and
coats
thrown
over
*NL*
their
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
in
,
get
in
!
''
shouted
one
of
them
,
a
young
thick-necked
peasant
with
*NL*
a
fleshy
face
red
as
a
carrot
.
``
I
'll
take
you
all
,
get
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
once
there
was
an
outbreak
of
laughter
and
exclamations
in
the
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
us
all
with
a
beast
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mikolka
,
are
you
crazy
to
put
a
nag
like
that
in
such
a
cart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
mare
is
twenty
if
she
is
a
day
,
mates
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
in
,
I
'll
take
you
all
,
''
Mikolka
shouted
again
,
leaping
first
into
*NL*
the
cart
,
seizing
the
reins
and
standing
straight
up
in
front
.
``
The
bay
*NL*
has
gone
with
Matvey
,
''
he
shouted
from
the
cart
--
``
and
this
brute
,
mates
,
*NL*
is
just
breaking
my
heart
,
I
feel
as
if
I
could
kill
her
.
She
's
just
*NL*
eating
her
head
off
.
Get
in
,
I
tell
you
!
I
'll
make
her
gallop
!
She
'll
*NL*
gallop
!
''
and
he
picked
up
the
whip
,
preparing
himself
with
relish
to
*NL*
flog
the
little
mare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
in
!
Come
along
!
''
The
crowd
laughed
.
``
D'you
hear
,
she
'll
gallop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gallop
indeed
!
She
has
not
had
a
gallop
in
her
for
the
last
ten
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
jog
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
mind
her
,
mates
,
bring
a
whip
each
of
you
,
get
ready
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
Give
it
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
clambered
into
Mikolka
's
cart
,
laughing
and
making
jokes
.
Six
*NL*
men
got
in
and
there
was
still
room
for
more
.
They
hauled
in
a
fat
,
*NL*
rosy-cheeked
woman
.
She
was
dressed
in
red
cotton
,
in
a
pointed
,
beaded
*NL*
headdress
and
thick
leather
shoes
;
she
was
cracking
nuts
and
laughing
.
*NL*
The
crowd
round
them
was
laughing
too
and
indeed
,
how
could
they
help
*NL*
laughing
?
That
wretched
nag
was
to
drag
all
the
cartload
of
them
at
a
*NL*
gallop
!
Two
young
fellows
in
the
cart
were
just
getting
whips
ready
to
*NL*
help
Mikolka
.
With
the
cry
of
``
now
,
''
the
mare
tugged
with
all
her
might
,
*NL*
but
far
from
galloping
,
could
scarcely
move
forward
;
she
struggled
with
*NL*
her
legs
,
gasping
and
shrinking
from
the
blows
of
the
three
whips
which
*NL*
were
showered
upon
her
like
hail
.
The
laughter
in
the
cart
and
in
the
*NL*
crowd
was
redoubled
,
but
Mikolka
flew
into
a
rage
and
furiously
thrashed
*NL*
the
mare
,
as
though
he
supposed
she
really
could
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
get
in
,
too
,
mates
,
''
shouted
a
young
man
in
the
crowd
whose
*NL*
appetite
was
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
in
,
all
get
in
,
''
cried
Mikolka
,
``
she
will
draw
you
all
.
I
'll
beat
*NL*
her
to
death
!
''
And
he
thrashed
and
thrashed
at
the
mare
,
beside
himself
*NL*
with
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
father
,
''
he
cried
,
``
father
,
what
are
they
doing
?
Father
,
they
*NL*
are
beating
the
poor
horse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
come
along
!
''
said
his
father
.
``
They
are
drunken
and
*NL*
foolish
,
they
are
in
fun
;
come
away
,
do
n't
look
!
''
and
he
tried
to
draw
*NL*
him
away
,
but
he
tore
himself
away
from
his
hand
,
and
,
beside
himself
*NL*
with
horror
,
ran
to
the
horse
.
The
poor
beast
was
in
a
bad
way
.
She
was
*NL*
gasping
,
standing
still
,
then
tugging
again
and
almost
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
her
to
death
,
''
cried
Mikolka
,
``
it
's
come
to
that
.
I
'll
do
for
*NL*
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
about
,
are
you
a
Christian
,
you
devil
?
''
shouted
an
old
man
*NL*
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
anyone
ever
see
the
like
?
A
wretched
nag
like
that
pulling
such
a
*NL*
cartload
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
kill
her
,
''
shouted
the
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
meddle
!
It
's
my
property
,
I
'll
do
what
I
choose
.
Get
in
,
more
of
*NL*
you
!
Get
in
,
all
of
you
!
I
will
have
her
go
at
a
gallop
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
laughter
broke
into
a
roar
and
covered
everything
:
the
mare
,
*NL*
roused
by
the
shower
of
blows
,
began
feebly
kicking
.
Even
the
old
man
*NL*
could
not
help
smiling
.
To
think
of
a
wretched
little
beast
like
that
*NL*
trying
to
kick
!
*NL*
*NL*
Two
lads
in
the
crowd
snatched
up
whips
and
ran
to
the
mare
to
beat
her
*NL*
about
the
ribs
.
One
ran
each
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hit
her
in
the
face
,
in
the
eyes
,
in
the
eyes
,
''
cried
Mikolka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
us
a
song
,
mates
,
''
shouted
someone
in
the
cart
and
everyone
in
the
*NL*
cart
joined
in
a
riotous
song
,
jingling
a
tambourine
and
whistling
.
The
*NL*
woman
went
on
cracking
nuts
and
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
He
ran
beside
the
mare
,
ran
in
front
of
her
,
saw
her
being
whipped
*NL*
across
the
eyes
,
right
in
the
eyes
!
He
was
crying
,
he
felt
choking
,
his
*NL*
tears
were
streaming
.
One
of
the
men
gave
him
a
cut
with
the
whip
across
*NL*
the
face
,
he
did
not
feel
it
.
Wringing
his
hands
and
screaming
,
he
*NL*
rushed
up
to
the
grey-headed
old
man
with
the
grey
beard
,
who
was
*NL*
shaking
his
head
in
disapproval
.
One
woman
seized
him
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
would
have
taken
him
away
,
but
he
tore
himself
from
her
and
ran
back
to
*NL*
the
mare
.
She
was
almost
at
the
last
gasp
,
but
began
kicking
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
teach
you
to
kick
,
''
Mikolka
shouted
ferociously
.
He
threw
down
*NL*
the
whip
,
bent
forward
and
picked
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
cart
a
long
,
*NL*
thick
shaft
,
he
took
hold
of
one
end
with
both
hands
and
with
an
effort
*NL*
brandished
it
over
the
mare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
crush
her
,
''
was
shouted
round
him
.
``
He
'll
kill
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
property
,
''
shouted
Mikolka
and
brought
the
shaft
down
with
a
*NL*
swinging
blow
.
There
was
a
sound
of
a
heavy
thud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thrash
her
,
thrash
her
!
Why
have
you
stopped
?
''
shouted
voices
in
the
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mikolka
swung
the
shaft
a
second
time
and
it
fell
a
second
time
*NL*
on
the
spine
of
the
luckless
mare
.
She
sank
back
on
her
haunches
,
but
*NL*
lurched
forward
and
tugged
forward
with
all
her
force
,
tugged
first
on
*NL*
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
,
trying
to
move
the
cart
.
But
the
six
*NL*
whips
were
attacking
her
in
all
directions
,
and
the
shaft
was
raised
*NL*
again
and
fell
upon
her
a
third
time
,
then
a
fourth
,
with
heavy
measured
*NL*
blows
.
Mikolka
was
in
a
fury
that
he
could
not
kill
her
at
one
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
tough
one
,
''
was
shouted
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
fall
in
a
minute
,
mates
,
there
will
soon
be
an
end
of
her
,
''
said
*NL*
an
admiring
spectator
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
an
axe
to
her
!
Finish
her
off
,
''
shouted
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
you
!
Stand
off
,
''
Mikolka
screamed
frantically
;
he
threw
down
*NL*
the
shaft
,
stooped
down
in
the
cart
and
picked
up
an
iron
crowbar
.
``
Look
*NL*
out
,
''
he
shouted
,
and
with
all
his
might
he
dealt
a
stunning
blow
at
the
*NL*
poor
mare
.
The
blow
fell
;
the
mare
staggered
,
sank
back
,
tried
to
pull
,
*NL*
but
the
bar
fell
again
with
a
swinging
blow
on
her
back
and
she
fell
on
*NL*
the
ground
like
a
log
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
her
off
,
''
shouted
Mikolka
and
he
leapt
beside
himself
,
out
of
*NL*
the
cart
.
Several
young
men
,
also
flushed
with
drink
,
seized
anything
*NL*
they
could
come
across
--
whips
,
sticks
,
poles
,
and
ran
to
the
dying
*NL*
mare
.
Mikolka
stood
on
one
side
and
began
dealing
random
blows
with
the
*NL*
crowbar
.
The
mare
stretched
out
her
head
,
drew
a
long
breath
and
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
butchered
her
,
''
someone
shouted
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
would
n't
she
gallop
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
property
!
''
shouted
Mikolka
,
with
bloodshot
eyes
,
brandishing
the
bar
*NL*
in
his
hands
.
He
stood
as
though
regretting
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
*NL*
beat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
mistake
about
it
,
you
are
not
a
Christian
,
''
many
voices
were
*NL*
shouting
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
poor
boy
,
beside
himself
,
made
his
way
,
screaming
,
through
the
*NL*
crowd
to
the
sorrel
nag
,
put
his
arms
round
her
bleeding
dead
head
and
*NL*
kissed
it
,
kissed
the
eyes
and
kissed
the
lips
...
Then
he
jumped
up
and
*NL*
flew
in
a
frenzy
with
his
little
fists
out
at
Mikolka
.
At
that
instant
*NL*
his
father
,
who
had
been
running
after
him
,
snatched
him
up
and
carried
*NL*
him
out
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
come
!
Let
us
go
home
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
Why
did
they
...
kill
...
the
poor
horse
!
''
he
sobbed
,
but
his
*NL*
voice
broke
and
the
words
came
in
shrieks
from
his
panting
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
drunk
...
They
are
brutal
...
it
's
not
our
business
!
''
said
his
*NL*
father
.
He
put
his
arms
round
his
father
but
he
felt
choked
,
choked
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
draw
a
breath
,
to
cry
out
--
and
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waked
up
,
gasping
for
breath
,
his
hair
soaked
with
perspiration
,
and
*NL*
stood
up
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
that
was
only
a
dream
,
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
under
a
tree
*NL*
and
drawing
deep
breaths
.
``
But
what
is
it
?
Is
it
some
fever
coming
on
?
*NL*
Such
a
hideous
dream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
utterly
broken
:
darkness
and
confusion
were
in
his
soul
.
He
*NL*
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
he
cried
,
``
can
it
be
,
can
it
be
,
that
I
shall
really
take
an
*NL*
axe
,
that
I
shall
strike
her
on
the
head
,
split
her
skull
open
...
that
I
*NL*
shall
tread
in
the
sticky
warm
blood
,
break
the
lock
,
steal
and
tremble
;
*NL*
hide
,
all
spattered
in
the
blood
...
with
the
axe
...
Good
God
,
can
it
*NL*
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
as
he
said
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
am
I
going
on
like
this
?
''
he
continued
,
sitting
up
again
,
as
it
*NL*
were
in
profound
amazement
.
``
I
knew
that
I
could
never
bring
myself
*NL*
to
it
,
so
what
have
I
been
torturing
myself
for
till
now
?
Yesterday
,
*NL*
yesterday
,
when
I
went
to
make
that
...
_
experiment
_
,
yesterday
I
*NL*
realised
completely
that
I
could
never
bear
to
do
it
...
Why
am
I
going
*NL*
over
it
again
,
then
?
Why
am
I
hesitating
?
As
I
came
down
the
stairs
*NL*
yesterday
,
I
said
myself
that
it
was
base
,
loathsome
,
vile
,
vile
...
the
*NL*
very
thought
of
it
made
me
feel
sick
and
filled
me
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
could
n't
do
it
,
I
could
n't
do
it
!
Granted
,
granted
that
there
is
*NL*
no
flaw
in
all
that
reasoning
,
that
all
that
I
have
concluded
this
last
*NL*
month
is
clear
as
day
,
true
as
arithmetic
...
My
God
!
Anyway
I
could
n't
*NL*
bring
myself
to
it
!
I
could
n't
do
it
,
I
could
n't
do
it
!
Why
,
why
then
am
*NL*
I
still
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
to
his
feet
,
looked
round
in
wonder
as
though
surprised
at
*NL*
finding
himself
in
this
place
,
and
went
towards
the
bridge
.
He
was
pale
,
*NL*
his
eyes
glowed
,
he
was
exhausted
in
every
limb
,
but
he
seemed
suddenly
*NL*
to
breathe
more
easily
.
He
felt
he
had
cast
off
that
fearful
burden
that
*NL*
had
so
long
been
weighing
upon
him
,
and
all
at
once
there
was
a
sense
*NL*
of
relief
and
peace
in
his
soul
.
``
Lord
,
''
he
prayed
,
``
show
me
my
path
--
I
*NL*
renounce
that
accursed
...
dream
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Crossing
the
bridge
,
he
gazed
quietly
and
calmly
at
the
Neva
,
at
the
*NL*
glowing
red
sun
setting
in
the
glowing
sky
.
In
spite
of
his
weakness
he
*NL*
was
not
conscious
of
fatigue
.
It
was
as
though
an
abscess
that
had
been
*NL*
forming
for
a
month
past
in
his
heart
had
suddenly
broken
.
Freedom
,
*NL*
freedom
!
He
was
free
from
that
spell
,
that
sorcery
,
that
obsession
!
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
,
when
he
recalled
that
time
and
all
that
happened
to
him
during
*NL*
those
days
,
minute
by
minute
,
point
by
point
,
he
was
superstitiously
*NL*
impressed
by
one
circumstance
,
which
,
though
in
itself
not
very
*NL*
exceptional
,
always
seemed
to
him
afterwards
the
predestined
*NL*
turning-point
of
his
fate
.
He
could
never
understand
and
explain
to
*NL*
himself
why
,
when
he
was
tired
and
worn
out
,
when
it
would
have
been
*NL*
more
convenient
for
him
to
go
home
by
the
shortest
and
most
direct
way
,
*NL*
he
had
returned
by
the
Hay
Market
where
he
had
no
need
to
go
.
It
was
*NL*
obviously
and
quite
unnecessarily
out
of
his
way
,
though
not
much
so
.
It
*NL*
is
true
that
it
happened
to
him
dozens
of
times
to
return
home
without
*NL*
noticing
what
streets
he
passed
through
.
But
why
,
he
was
always
asking
*NL*
himself
,
why
had
such
an
important
,
such
a
decisive
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
such
an
absolutely
chance
meeting
happened
in
the
Hay
Market
-LRB-
where
he
*NL*
had
moreover
no
reason
to
go
-RRB-
at
the
very
hour
,
the
very
minute
of
his
*NL*
life
when
he
was
just
in
the
very
mood
and
in
the
very
circumstances
*NL*
in
which
that
meeting
was
able
to
exert
the
gravest
and
most
decisive
*NL*
influence
on
his
whole
destiny
?
As
though
it
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
*NL*
him
on
purpose
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
nine
o'clock
when
he
crossed
the
Hay
Market
.
At
the
tables
*NL*
and
the
barrows
,
at
the
booths
and
the
shops
,
all
the
market
people
were
*NL*
closing
their
establishments
or
clearing
away
and
packing
up
their
*NL*
wares
and
,
like
their
customers
,
were
going
home
.
Rag
pickers
and
*NL*
costermongers
of
all
kinds
were
crowding
round
the
taverns
in
the
dirty
*NL*
and
stinking
courtyards
of
the
Hay
Market
.
Raskolnikov
particularly
*NL*
liked
this
place
and
the
neighbouring
alleys
,
when
he
wandered
aimlessly
*NL*
in
the
streets
.
Here
his
rags
did
not
attract
contemptuous
attention
,
*NL*
and
one
could
walk
about
in
any
attire
without
scandalising
people
.
At
*NL*
the
corner
of
an
alley
a
huckster
and
his
wife
had
two
tables
set
out
*NL*
with
tapes
,
thread
,
cotton
handkerchiefs
,
etc.
.
They
,
too
,
had
got
up
to
*NL*
go
home
,
but
were
lingering
in
conversation
with
a
friend
,
who
had
just
*NL*
come
up
to
them
.
This
friend
was
Lizaveta
Ivanovna
,
or
,
as
everyone
*NL*
called
her
,
Lizaveta
,
the
younger
sister
of
the
old
pawnbroker
,
Alyona
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
whom
Raskolnikov
had
visited
the
previous
day
to
pawn
his
*NL*
watch
and
make
his
_
experiment
_
...
He
already
knew
all
about
Lizaveta
*NL*
and
she
knew
him
a
little
too
.
She
was
a
single
woman
of
about
*NL*
thirty-five
,
tall
,
clumsy
,
timid
,
submissive
and
almost
idiotic
.
She
was
*NL*
a
complete
slave
and
went
in
fear
and
trembling
of
her
sister
,
who
*NL*
made
her
work
day
and
night
,
and
even
beat
her
.
She
was
standing
with
*NL*
a
bundle
before
the
huckster
and
his
wife
,
listening
earnestly
and
*NL*
doubtfully
.
They
were
talking
of
something
with
special
warmth
.
The
*NL*
moment
Raskolnikov
caught
sight
of
her
,
he
was
overcome
by
a
strange
*NL*
sensation
as
it
were
of
intense
astonishment
,
though
there
was
nothing
*NL*
astonishing
about
this
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
make
up
your
mind
for
yourself
,
Lizaveta
Ivanovna
,
''
the
*NL*
huckster
was
saying
aloud
.
``
Come
round
to-morrow
about
seven
.
They
will
*NL*
be
here
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
?
''
said
Lizaveta
slowly
and
thoughtfully
,
as
though
unable
to
*NL*
make
up
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
what
a
fright
you
are
in
of
Alyona
Ivanovna
,
''
gabbled
*NL*
the
huckster
's
wife
,
a
lively
little
woman
.
``
I
look
at
you
,
you
are
like
*NL*
some
little
babe
.
And
she
is
not
your
own
sister
either
--
nothing
but
a
*NL*
step-sister
and
what
a
hand
she
keeps
over
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
time
do
n't
say
a
word
to
Alyona
Ivanovna
,
''
her
husband
*NL*
interrupted
;
``
that
's
my
advice
,
but
come
round
to
us
without
asking
.
*NL*
It
will
be
worth
your
while
.
Later
on
your
sister
herself
may
have
a
*NL*
notion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
seven
o'clock
to-morrow
.
And
they
will
be
here
.
You
will
be
able
*NL*
to
decide
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
'll
have
a
cup
of
tea
,
''
added
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
'll
come
,
''
said
Lizaveta
,
still
pondering
,
and
she
began
*NL*
slowly
moving
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
just
passed
and
heard
no
more
.
He
passed
softly
,
*NL*
unnoticed
,
trying
not
to
miss
a
word
.
His
first
amazement
was
followed
*NL*
by
a
thrill
of
horror
,
like
a
shiver
running
down
his
spine
.
He
had
*NL*
learnt
,
he
had
suddenly
quite
unexpectedly
learnt
,
that
the
next
day
at
*NL*
seven
o'clock
Lizaveta
,
the
old
woman
's
sister
and
only
companion
,
would
*NL*
be
away
from
home
and
that
therefore
at
seven
o'clock
precisely
the
old
*NL*
woman
_
would
be
left
alone
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
only
a
few
steps
from
his
lodging
.
He
went
in
like
a
man
*NL*
condemned
to
death
.
He
thought
of
nothing
and
was
incapable
of
thinking
;
*NL*
but
he
felt
suddenly
in
his
whole
being
that
he
had
no
more
freedom
*NL*
of
thought
,
no
will
,
and
that
everything
was
suddenly
and
irrevocably
*NL*
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
if
he
had
to
wait
whole
years
for
a
suitable
opportunity
,
he
*NL*
could
not
reckon
on
a
more
certain
step
towards
the
success
of
the
plan
*NL*
than
that
which
had
just
presented
itself
.
In
any
case
,
it
would
have
*NL*
been
difficult
to
find
out
beforehand
and
with
certainty
,
with
*NL*
greater
exactness
and
less
risk
,
and
without
dangerous
inquiries
and
*NL*
investigations
,
that
next
day
at
a
certain
time
an
old
woman
,
on
whose
*NL*
life
an
attempt
was
contemplated
,
would
be
at
home
and
entirely
alone
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
Raskolnikov
happened
to
find
out
why
the
huckster
and
his
*NL*
wife
had
invited
Lizaveta
.
It
was
a
very
ordinary
matter
and
there
was
*NL*
nothing
exceptional
about
it
.
A
family
who
had
come
to
the
town
and
been
*NL*
reduced
to
poverty
were
selling
their
household
goods
and
clothes
,
all
*NL*
women
's
things
.
As
the
things
would
have
fetched
little
in
the
market
,
*NL*
they
were
looking
for
a
dealer
.
This
was
Lizaveta
's
business
.
She
*NL*
undertook
such
jobs
and
was
frequently
employed
,
as
she
was
very
honest
*NL*
and
always
fixed
a
fair
price
and
stuck
to
it
.
She
spoke
as
a
rule
*NL*
little
and
,
as
we
have
said
already
,
she
was
very
submissive
and
timid
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Raskolnikov
had
become
superstitious
of
late
.
The
traces
of
*NL*
superstition
remained
in
him
long
after
,
and
were
almost
ineradicable
.
*NL*
And
in
all
this
he
was
always
afterwards
disposed
to
see
something
*NL*
strange
and
mysterious
,
as
it
were
,
the
presence
of
some
peculiar
*NL*
influences
and
coincidences
.
In
the
previous
winter
a
student
he
knew
*NL*
called
Pokorev
,
who
had
left
for
Harkov
,
had
chanced
in
conversation
to
*NL*
give
him
the
address
of
Alyona
Ivanovna
,
the
old
pawnbroker
,
in
case
he
*NL*
might
want
to
pawn
anything
.
For
a
long
while
he
did
not
go
to
her
,
for
*NL*
he
had
lessons
and
managed
to
get
along
somehow
.
Six
weeks
ago
he
had
*NL*
remembered
the
address
;
he
had
two
articles
that
could
be
pawned
:
his
*NL*
father
's
old
silver
watch
and
a
little
gold
ring
with
three
red
stones
,
*NL*
a
present
from
his
sister
at
parting
.
He
decided
to
take
the
ring
.
When
*NL*
he
found
the
old
woman
he
had
felt
an
insurmountable
repulsion
for
her
*NL*
at
the
first
glance
,
though
he
knew
nothing
special
about
her
.
He
got
*NL*
two
roubles
from
her
and
went
into
a
miserable
little
tavern
on
his
way
*NL*
home
.
He
asked
for
tea
,
sat
down
and
sank
into
deep
thought
.
A
strange
*NL*
idea
was
pecking
at
his
brain
like
a
chicken
in
the
egg
,
and
very
,
very
*NL*
much
absorbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
beside
him
at
the
next
table
there
was
sitting
a
student
,
whom
he
*NL*
did
not
know
and
had
never
seen
,
and
with
him
a
young
officer
.
They
had
*NL*
played
a
game
of
billiards
and
began
drinking
tea
.
All
at
once
he
heard
*NL*
the
student
mention
to
the
officer
the
pawnbroker
Alyona
Ivanovna
and
*NL*
give
him
her
address
.
This
of
itself
seemed
strange
to
Raskolnikov
;
he
*NL*
had
just
come
from
her
and
here
at
once
he
heard
her
name
.
Of
course
*NL*
it
was
a
chance
,
but
he
could
not
shake
off
a
very
extraordinary
*NL*
impression
,
and
here
someone
seemed
to
be
speaking
expressly
for
him
;
*NL*
the
student
began
telling
his
friend
various
details
about
Alyona
*NL*
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
first-rate
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
can
always
get
money
from
her
.
She
is
*NL*
as
rich
as
a
Jew
,
she
can
give
you
five
thousand
roubles
at
a
time
and
*NL*
she
is
not
above
taking
a
pledge
for
a
rouble
.
Lots
of
our
fellows
have
*NL*
had
dealings
with
her
.
But
she
is
an
awful
old
harpy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
describing
how
spiteful
and
uncertain
she
was
,
how
if
you
*NL*
were
only
a
day
late
with
your
interest
the
pledge
was
lost
;
how
she
*NL*
gave
a
quarter
of
the
value
of
an
article
and
took
five
and
even
seven
*NL*
percent
a
month
on
it
and
so
on
.
The
student
chattered
on
,
saying
*NL*
that
she
had
a
sister
Lizaveta
,
whom
the
wretched
little
creature
was
*NL*
continually
beating
,
and
kept
in
complete
bondage
like
a
small
child
,
*NL*
though
Lizaveta
was
at
least
six
feet
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
phenomenon
for
you
,
''
cried
the
student
and
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
talking
about
Lizaveta
.
The
student
spoke
about
her
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
relish
and
was
continually
laughing
and
the
officer
listened
*NL*
with
great
interest
and
asked
him
to
send
Lizaveta
to
do
some
mending
*NL*
for
him
.
Raskolnikov
did
not
miss
a
word
and
learned
everything
about
*NL*
her
.
Lizaveta
was
younger
than
the
old
woman
and
was
her
half-sister
,
*NL*
being
the
child
of
a
different
mother
.
She
was
thirty-five
.
She
worked
*NL*
day
and
night
for
her
sister
,
and
besides
doing
the
cooking
and
the
*NL*
washing
,
she
did
sewing
and
worked
as
a
charwoman
and
gave
her
sister
*NL*
all
she
earned
.
She
did
not
dare
to
accept
an
order
or
job
of
any
kind
*NL*
without
her
sister
's
permission
.
The
old
woman
had
already
made
her
*NL*
will
,
and
Lizaveta
knew
of
it
,
and
by
this
will
she
would
not
get
a
*NL*
farthing
;
nothing
but
the
movables
,
chairs
and
so
on
;
all
the
money
was
*NL*
left
to
a
monastery
in
the
province
of
N
--
,
that
prayers
might
be
*NL*
said
for
her
in
perpetuity
.
Lizaveta
was
of
lower
rank
than
her
sister
,
*NL*
unmarried
and
awfully
uncouth
in
appearance
,
remarkably
tall
with
long
*NL*
feet
that
looked
as
if
they
were
bent
outwards
.
She
always
wore
battered
*NL*
goatskin
shoes
,
and
was
clean
in
her
person
.
What
the
student
expressed
*NL*
most
surprise
and
amusement
about
was
the
fact
that
Lizaveta
was
*NL*
continually
with
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
say
she
is
hideous
?
''
observed
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
so
dark-skinned
and
looks
like
a
soldier
dressed
up
,
but
*NL*
you
know
she
is
not
at
all
hideous
.
She
has
such
a
good-natured
face
*NL*
and
eyes
.
Strikingly
so
.
And
the
proof
of
it
is
that
lots
of
people
are
*NL*
attracted
by
her
.
She
is
such
a
soft
,
gentle
creature
,
ready
to
put
up
*NL*
with
anything
,
always
willing
,
willing
to
do
anything
.
And
her
smile
is
*NL*
really
very
sweet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
find
her
attractive
yourself
,
''
laughed
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
her
queerness
.
No
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
.
I
could
kill
that
damned
*NL*
old
woman
and
make
off
with
her
money
,
I
assure
you
,
without
the
*NL*
faintest
conscience-prick
,
''
the
student
added
with
warmth
.
The
officer
*NL*
laughed
again
while
Raskolnikov
shuddered
.
How
strange
it
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
I
want
to
ask
you
a
serious
question
,
''
the
student
said
hotly
.
*NL*
``
I
was
joking
of
course
,
but
look
here
;
on
one
side
we
have
a
stupid
,
*NL*
senseless
,
worthless
,
spiteful
,
ailing
,
horrid
old
woman
,
not
simply
*NL*
useless
but
doing
actual
mischief
,
who
has
not
an
idea
what
she
is
*NL*
living
for
herself
,
and
who
will
die
in
a
day
or
two
in
any
case
.
You
*NL*
understand
?
You
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
,
''
answered
the
officer
,
watching
his
excited
*NL*
companion
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
listen
then
.
On
the
other
side
,
fresh
young
lives
thrown
away
for
*NL*
want
of
help
and
by
thousands
,
on
every
side
!
A
hundred
thousand
good
*NL*
deeds
could
be
done
and
helped
,
on
that
old
woman
's
money
which
will
be
*NL*
buried
in
a
monastery
!
Hundreds
,
thousands
perhaps
,
might
be
set
on
the
*NL*
right
path
;
dozens
of
families
saved
from
destitution
,
from
ruin
,
from
*NL*
vice
,
from
the
Lock
hospitals
--
and
all
with
her
money
.
Kill
her
,
take
*NL*
her
money
and
with
the
help
of
it
devote
oneself
to
the
service
of
*NL*
humanity
and
the
good
of
all
.
What
do
you
think
,
would
not
one
tiny
*NL*
crime
be
wiped
out
by
thousands
of
good
deeds
?
For
one
life
thousands
*NL*
would
be
saved
from
corruption
and
decay
.
One
death
,
and
a
hundred
lives
*NL*
in
exchange
--
it
's
simple
arithmetic
!
Besides
,
what
value
has
the
life
of
*NL*
that
sickly
,
stupid
,
ill-natured
old
woman
in
the
balance
of
existence
!
*NL*
No
more
than
the
life
of
a
louse
,
of
a
black-beetle
,
less
in
fact
*NL*
because
the
old
woman
is
doing
harm
.
She
is
wearing
out
the
lives
of
*NL*
others
;
the
other
day
she
bit
Lizaveta
's
finger
out
of
spite
;
it
almost
*NL*
had
to
be
amputated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
does
not
deserve
to
live
,
''
remarked
the
officer
,
``
but
*NL*
there
it
is
,
it
's
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
brother
,
but
we
have
to
correct
and
direct
nature
,
and
,
but
*NL*
for
that
,
we
should
drown
in
an
ocean
of
prejudice
.
But
for
that
,
*NL*
there
would
never
have
been
a
single
great
man
.
They
talk
of
*NL*
duty
,
conscience
--
I
do
n't
want
to
say
anything
against
duty
and
*NL*
conscience
;
--
but
the
point
is
,
what
do
we
mean
by
them
?
Stay
,
I
have
*NL*
another
question
to
ask
you
.
Listen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
stay
,
I
'll
ask
you
a
question

Listen
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
talking
and
speechifying
away

tell
me
,
would
you
kill
the
*NL*
old
woman
_
yourself
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
!
I
was
only
arguing
the
justice
of
it

It
's
nothing
to

do
with
me
...

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
think
,
if
you

not
do
it
yourself

there
's
no
justice
about
*NL*
it
...
Let
us
have
another
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
violently
agitated
.
Of
course
,
it
was
all
ordinary
*NL*
youthful
talk
and
thought
,
such
as
he
had
often
heard
before
in
*NL*
different
forms
and
on
different
themes
.
But
why
had
he
happened
to
hear
*NL*
such
a
discussion
and
such
ideas
at
the
very
moment
when
his
own
brain
*NL*
was
just
conceiving
...
_
the
very
same
ideas
_
?
And
why
,
just
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
had
brought
away
the
embryo
of
his
idea
from
the
old
*NL*
woman
had
he
dropped
at
once
upon
a
conversation
about
her
?
This
*NL*
coincidence
always
seemed
strange
to
him
.
This
trivial
talk
in
a
tavern
*NL*
had
an
immense
influence
on
him
in
his
later
action
;
as
though
there
had
*NL*
really
been
in
it
something
preordained
,
some
guiding
hint
...
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
from
the
Hay
Market
he
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
and
sat
*NL*
for
a
whole
hour
without
stirring
.
Meanwhile
it
got
dark
;
he
had
no
*NL*
candle
and
,
indeed
,
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
light
up
.
He
could
never
*NL*
recollect
whether
he
had
been
thinking
about
anything
at
that
time
.
At
*NL*
last
he
was
conscious
of
his
former
fever
and
shivering
,
and
he
realised
*NL*
with
relief
that
he
could
lie
down
on
the
sofa
.
Soon
heavy
,
leaden
sleep
*NL*
came
over
him
,
as
it
were
crushing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slept
an
extraordinarily
long
time
and
without
dreaming
.
Nastasya
,
*NL*
coming
into
his
room
at
ten
o'clock
the
next
morning
,
had
difficulty
*NL*
in
rousing
him
.
She
brought
him
in
tea
and
bread
.
The
tea
was
again
the
*NL*
second
brew
and
again
in
her
own
tea-pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
,
how
he
sleeps
!
''
she
cried
indignantly
.
``
And
he
is
always
*NL*
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
with
an
effort
.
His
head
ached
,
he
stood
up
,
took
a
turn
in
*NL*
his
garret
and
sank
back
on
the
sofa
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
sleep
again
,
''
cried
Nastasya
.
``
Are
you
ill
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
some
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afterwards
,
''
he
said
with
an
effort
,
closing
his
eyes
again
and
turning
*NL*
to
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasya
stood
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
really
is
ill
,
''
she
said
,
turned
and
went
out
.
She
came
in
*NL*
again
at
two
o'clock
with
soup
.
He
was
lying
as
before
.
The
tea
stood
*NL*
untouched
.
Nastasya
felt
positively
offended
and
began
wrathfully
*NL*
rousing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
lying
like
a
log
?
''
she
shouted
,
looking
at
him
with
*NL*
repulsion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
,
and
sat
down
again
,
but
said
nothing
and
stared
at
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ill
or
not
?
''
asked
Nastasya
and
again
received
no
answer
.
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
air
,
''
she
said
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
``
Will
you
eat
it
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afterwards
,
''
he
said
weakly
.
``
You
can
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
motioned
her
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
a
little
longer
,
looked
at
him
with
compassion
and
went
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
afterwards
,
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
for
a
long
while
*NL*
at
the
tea
and
the
soup
.
Then
he
took
the
bread
,
took
up
a
spoon
and
*NL*
began
to
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ate
a
little
,
three
or
four
spoonfuls
,
without
appetite
,
as
it
were
*NL*
mechanically
.
His
head
ached
less
.
After
his
meal
he
stretched
himself
*NL*
on
the
sofa
again
,
but
now
he
could
not
sleep
;
he
lay
without
stirring
,
*NL*
with
his
face
in
the
pillow
.
He
was
haunted
by
day-dreams
and
such
*NL*
strange
day-dreams
;
in
one
,
that
kept
recurring
,
he
fancied
that
he
was
*NL*
in
Africa
,
in
Egypt
,
in
some
sort
of
oasis
.
The
caravan
was
resting
,
*NL*
the
camels
were
peacefully
lying
down
;
the
palms
stood
all
around
in
a
*NL*
complete
circle
;
all
the
party
were
at
dinner
.
But
he
was
drinking
water
*NL*
from
a
spring
which
flowed
gurgling
close
by
.
And
it
was
so
cool
,
it
was
*NL*
wonderful
,
wonderful
,
blue
,
cold
water
running
among
the
parti-coloured
*NL*
stones
and
over
the
clean
sand
which
glistened
here
and
there
like
*NL*
gold
...
Suddenly
he
heard
a
clock
strike
.
He
started
,
roused
himself
,
*NL*
raised
his
head
,
looked
out
of
the
window
,
and
seeing
how
late
it
was
,
*NL*
suddenly
jumped
up
wide
awake
as
though
someone
had
pulled
him
off
the
*NL*
sofa
.
He
crept
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
,
stealthily
opened
it
and
began
*NL*
listening
on
the
staircase
.
His
heart
beat
terribly
.
But
all
was
quiet
*NL*
on
the
stairs
as
if
everyone
was
asleep
...
It
seemed
to
him
strange
and
*NL*
monstrous
that
he
could
have
slept
in
such
forgetfulness
from
the
*NL*
previous
day
and
had
done
nothing
,
had
prepared
nothing
yet
...
And
*NL*
meanwhile
perhaps
it
had
struck
six
.
And
his
drowsiness
and
stupefaction
*NL*
were
followed
by
an
extraordinary
,
feverish
,
as
it
were
distracted
*NL*
haste
.
But
the
preparations
to
be
made
were
few
.
He
concentrated
all
his
*NL*
energies
on
thinking
of
everything
and
forgetting
nothing
;
and
his
heart
*NL*
kept
beating
and
thumping
so
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
.
First
he
had
*NL*
to
make
a
noose
and
sew
it
into
his
overcoat
--
a
work
of
a
moment
.
He
*NL*
rummaged
under
his
pillow
and
picked
out
amongst
the
linen
stuffed
away
*NL*
under
it
,
a
worn
out
,
old
unwashed
shirt
.
From
its
rags
he
tore
a
long
*NL*
strip
,
a
couple
of
inches
wide
and
about
sixteen
inches
long
.
He
folded
*NL*
this
strip
in
two
,
took
off
his
wide
,
strong
summer
overcoat
of
some
*NL*
stout
cotton
material
-LRB-
his
only
outer
garment
-RRB-
and
began
sewing
the
two
*NL*
ends
of
the
rag
on
the
inside
,
under
the
left
armhole
.
His
hands
shook
*NL*
as
he
sewed
,
but
he
did
it
successfully
so
that
nothing
showed
outside
*NL*
when
he
put
the
coat
on
again
.
The
needle
and
thread
he
had
got
ready
*NL*
long
before
and
they
lay
on
his
table
in
a
piece
of
paper
.
As
for
the
*NL*
noose
,
it
was
a
very
ingenious
device
of
his
own
;
the
noose
was
intended
*NL*
for
the
axe
.
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
carry
the
axe
through
the
*NL*
street
in
his
hands
.
And
if
hidden
under
his
coat
he
would
still
have
*NL*
had
to
support
it
with
his
hand
,
which
would
have
been
noticeable
.
Now
*NL*
he
had
only
to
put
the
head
of
the
axe
in
the
noose
,
and
it
would
hang
*NL*
quietly
under
his
arm
on
the
inside
.
Putting
his
hand
in
his
coat
*NL*
pocket
,
he
could
hold
the
end
of
the
handle
all
the
way
,
so
that
it
did
*NL*
not
swing
;
and
as
the
coat
was
very
full
,
a
regular
sack
in
fact
,
it
*NL*
could
not
be
seen
from
outside
that
he
was
holding
something
with
the
*NL*
hand
that
was
in
the
pocket
.
This
noose
,
too
,
he
had
designed
a
*NL*
fortnight
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
with
this
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
a
little
opening
*NL*
between
his
sofa
and
the
floor
,
fumbled
in
the
left
corner
and
drew
out
*NL*
the
_
pledge
_
,
which
he
had
got
ready
long
before
and
hidden
there
.
This
*NL*
pledge
was
,
however
,
only
a
smoothly
planed
piece
of
wood
the
size
and
*NL*
thickness
of
a
silver
cigarette
case
.
He
picked
up
this
piece
of
wood
*NL*
in
one
of
his
wanderings
in
a
courtyard
where
there
was
some
sort
of
*NL*
a
workshop
.
Afterwards
he
had
added
to
the
wood
a
thin
smooth
piece
*NL*
of
iron
,
which
he
had
also
picked
up
at
the
same
time
in
the
street
.
*NL*
Putting
the
iron
which
was
a
little
the
smaller
on
the
piece
of
wood
,
*NL*
he
fastened
them
very
firmly
,
crossing
and
re-crossing
the
thread
round
*NL*
them
;
then
wrapped
them
carefully
and
daintily
in
clean
white
paper
and
*NL*
tied
up
the
parcel
so
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
untie
it
.
This
*NL*
was
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
old
woman
for
a
time
,
while
*NL*
she
was
trying
to
undo
the
knot
,
and
so
to
gain
a
moment
.
The
iron
strip
*NL*
was
added
to
give
weight
,
so
that
the
woman
might
not
guess
the
first
*NL*
minute
that
the
``
thing
''
was
made
of
wood
.
All
this
had
been
stored
by
*NL*
him
beforehand
under
the
sofa
.
He
had
only
just
got
the
pledge
out
when
*NL*
he
heard
someone
suddenly
about
in
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
struck
six
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
ago
!
My
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
to
the
door
,
listened
,
caught
up
his
hat
and
began
to
descend
*NL*
his
thirteen
steps
cautiously
,
noiselessly
,
like
a
cat
.
He
had
still
the
*NL*
most
important
thing
to
do
--
to
steal
the
axe
from
the
kitchen
.
That
the
*NL*
deed
must
be
done
with
an
axe
he
had
decided
long
ago
.
He
had
also
a
*NL*
pocket
pruning-knife
,
but
he
could
not
rely
on
the
knife
and
still
less
*NL*
on
his
own
strength
,
and
so
resolved
finally
on
the
axe
.
We
may
note
in
*NL*
passing
,
one
peculiarity
in
regard
to
all
the
final
resolutions
taken
by
*NL*
him
in
the
matter
;
they
had
one
strange
characteristic
:
the
more
final
*NL*
they
were
,
the
more
hideous
and
the
more
absurd
they
at
once
became
in
*NL*
his
eyes
.
In
spite
of
all
his
agonising
inward
struggle
,
he
never
for
*NL*
a
single
instant
all
that
time
could
believe
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
*NL*
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
if
it
had
ever
happened
that
everything
to
the
least
point
*NL*
could
have
been
considered
and
finally
settled
,
and
no
uncertainty
of
*NL*
any
kind
had
remained
,
he
would
,
it
seems
,
have
renounced
it
all
*NL*
as
something
absurd
,
monstrous
and
impossible
.
But
a
whole
mass
of
*NL*
unsettled
points
and
uncertainties
remained
.
As
for
getting
the
axe
,
*NL*
that
trifling
business
cost
him
no
anxiety
,
for
nothing
could
be
easier
.
*NL*
Nastasya
was
continually
out
of
the
house
,
especially
in
the
evenings
;
*NL*
she
would
run
in
to
the
neighbours
or
to
a
shop
,
and
always
left
the
*NL*
door
ajar
.
It
was
the
one
thing
the
landlady
was
always
scolding
her
*NL*
about
.
And
so
,
when
the
time
came
,
he
would
only
have
to
go
quietly
into
*NL*
the
kitchen
and
to
take
the
axe
,
and
an
hour
later
-LRB-
when
everything
*NL*
was
over
-RRB-
go
in
and
put
it
back
again
.
But
these
were
doubtful
points
.
*NL*
Supposing
he
returned
an
hour
later
to
put
it
back
,
and
Nastasya
had
*NL*
come
back
and
was
on
the
spot
.
He
would
of
course
have
to
go
by
and
wait
*NL*
till
she
went
out
again
.
But
supposing
she
were
in
the
meantime
to
miss
*NL*
the
axe
,
look
for
it
,
make
an
outcry
--
that
would
mean
suspicion
or
at
*NL*
least
grounds
for
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
those
were
all
trifles
which
he
had
not
even
begun
to
consider
,
and
*NL*
indeed
he
had
no
time
.
He
was
thinking
of
the
chief
point
,
and
put
off
*NL*
trifling
details
,
until
_
he
could
believe
in
it
all
_
.
But
that
seemed
*NL*
utterly
unattainable
.
So
it
seemed
to
himself
at
least
.
He
could
not
*NL*
imagine
,
for
instance
,
that
he
would
sometime
leave
off
thinking
,
get
*NL*
up
and
simply
go
there
...
Even
his
late
experiment
-LRB-
i.e.
his
visit
with
*NL*
the
object
of
a
final
survey
of
the
place
-RRB-
was
simply
an
attempt
at
*NL*
an
experiment
,
far
from
being
the
real
thing
,
as
though
one
should
say
*NL*
``
come
,
let
us
go
and
try
it
--
why
dream
about
it
!
''
--
and
at
once
he
*NL*
had
broken
down
and
had
run
away
cursing
,
in
a
frenzy
with
himself
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
it
would
seem
,
as
regards
the
moral
question
,
that
his
*NL*
analysis
was
complete
;
his
casuistry
had
become
keen
as
a
razor
,
and
he
*NL*
could
not
find
rational
objections
in
himself
.
But
in
the
last
resort
*NL*
he
simply
ceased
to
believe
in
himself
,
and
doggedly
,
slavishly
sought
*NL*
arguments
in
all
directions
,
fumbling
for
them
,
as
though
someone
were
*NL*
forcing
and
drawing
him
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
--
long
before
indeed
--
he
had
been
much
occupied
with
one
*NL*
question
;
why
almost
all
crimes
are
so
badly
concealed
and
so
easily
*NL*
detected
,
and
why
almost
all
criminals
leave
such
obvious
traces
?
He
*NL*
had
come
gradually
to
many
different
and
curious
conclusions
,
and
in
his
*NL*
opinion
the
chief
reason
lay
not
so
much
in
the
material
impossibility
*NL*
of
concealing
the
crime
,
as
in
the
criminal
himself
.
Almost
every
*NL*
criminal
is
subject
to
a
failure
of
will
and
reasoning
power
by
a
*NL*
childish
and
phenomenal
heedlessness
,
at
the
very
instant
when
prudence
*NL*
and
caution
are
most
essential
.
It
was
his
conviction
that
this
eclipse
*NL*
of
reason
and
failure
of
will
power
attacked
a
man
like
a
disease
,
*NL*
developed
gradually
and
reached
its
highest
point
just
before
the
*NL*
perpetration
of
the
crime
,
continued
with
equal
violence
at
the
moment
*NL*
of
the
crime
and
for
longer
or
shorter
time
after
,
according
to
the
*NL*
individual
case
,
and
then
passed
off
like
any
other
disease
.
The
*NL*
question
whether
the
disease
gives
rise
to
the
crime
,
or
whether
the
*NL*
crime
from
its
own
peculiar
nature
is
always
accompanied
by
something
of
*NL*
the
nature
of
disease
,
he
did
not
yet
feel
able
to
decide
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
these
conclusions
,
he
decided
that
in
his
own
case
there
*NL*
could
not
be
such
a
morbid
reaction
,
that
his
reason
and
will
would
*NL*
remain
unimpaired
at
the
time
of
carrying
out
his
design
,
for
the
*NL*
simple
reason
that
his
design
was
``
not
a
crime
...
''
We
will
omit
all
the
*NL*
process
by
means
of
which
he
arrived
at
this
last
conclusion
;
we
have
*NL*
run
too
far
ahead
already
...
We
may
add
only
that
the
practical
,
purely
*NL*
material
difficulties
of
the
affair
occupied
a
secondary
position
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
``
One
has
but
to
keep
all
one
's
will-power
and
reason
to
deal
*NL*
with
them
,
and
they
will
all
be
overcome
at
the
time
when
once
one
has
*NL*
familiarised
oneself
with
the
minutest
details
of
the
business
...
''
But
*NL*
this
preparation
had
never
been
begun
.
His
final
decisions
were
what
he
*NL*
came
to
trust
least
,
and
when
the
hour
struck
,
it
all
came
to
pass
quite
*NL*
differently
,
as
it
were
accidentally
and
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
trifling
circumstance
upset
his
calculations
,
before
he
had
even
*NL*
left
the
staircase
.
When
he
reached
the
landlady
's
kitchen
,
the
door
*NL*
of
which
was
open
as
usual
,
he
glanced
cautiously
in
to
see
whether
,
in
*NL*
Nastasya
's
absence
,
the
landlady
herself
was
there
,
or
if
not
,
whether
*NL*
the
door
to
her
own
room
was
closed
,
so
that
she
might
not
peep
out
when
*NL*
he
went
in
for
the
axe
.
But
what
was
his
amazement
when
he
suddenly
*NL*
saw
that
Nastasya
was
not
only
at
home
in
the
kitchen
,
but
was
occupied
*NL*
there
,
taking
linen
out
of
a
basket
and
hanging
it
on
a
line
.
Seeing
*NL*
him
,
she
left
off
hanging
the
clothes
,
turned
to
him
and
stared
at
him
*NL*
all
the
time
he
was
passing
.
He
turned
away
his
eyes
,
and
walked
past
as
*NL*
though
he
noticed
nothing
.
But
it
was
the
end
of
everything
;
he
had
not
*NL*
the
axe
!
He
was
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
me
think
,
''
he
reflected
,
as
he
went
under
the
gateway
,
``
what
*NL*
made
me
think
that
she
would
be
sure
not
to
be
at
home
at
that
moment
!
*NL*
Why
,
why
,
why
did
I
assume
this
so
certainly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
crushed
and
even
humiliated
.
He
could
have
laughed
at
himself
in
*NL*
his
anger
...
A
dull
animal
rage
boiled
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
hesitating
in
the
gateway
.
To
go
into
the
street
,
to
go
a
walk
*NL*
for
appearance
'
sake
was
revolting
;
to
go
back
to
his
room
,
even
more
*NL*
revolting
.
``
And
what
a
chance
I
have
lost
for
ever
!
''
he
muttered
,
*NL*
standing
aimlessly
in
the
gateway
,
just
opposite
the
porter
's
little
*NL*
dark
room
,
which
was
also
open
.
Suddenly
he
started
.
From
the
porter
's
*NL*
room
,
two
paces
away
from
him
,
something
shining
under
the
bench
to
the
*NL*
right
caught
his
eye
...
He
looked
about
him
--
nobody
.
He
approached
the
*NL*
room
on
tiptoe
,
went
down
two
steps
into
it
and
in
a
faint
voice
called
*NL*
the
porter
.
``
Yes
,
not
at
home
!
Somewhere
near
though
,
in
the
yard
,
for
*NL*
the
door
is
wide
open
.
''
He
dashed
to
the
axe
-LRB-
it
was
an
axe
-RRB-
and
pulled
*NL*
it
out
from
under
the
bench
,
where
it
lay
between
two
chunks
of
wood
;
*NL*
at
once
,
before
going
out
,
he
made
it
fast
in
the
noose
,
he
thrust
both
*NL*
hands
into
his
pockets
and
went
out
of
the
room
;
no
one
had
noticed
him
!
*NL*
``
When
reason
fails
,
the
devil
helps
!
''
he
thought
with
a
strange
grin
.
*NL*
This
chance
raised
his
spirits
extraordinarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
quietly
and
sedately
,
without
hurry
,
to
avoid
awakening
*NL*
suspicion
.
He
scarcely
looked
at
the
passers-by
,
tried
to
escape
looking
*NL*
at
their
faces
at
all
,
and
to
be
as
little
noticeable
as
possible
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
thought
of
his
hat
.
``
Good
heavens
!
I
had
the
money
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
and
did
not
get
a
cap
to
wear
instead
!
''
A
curse
rose
*NL*
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
into
a
shop
,
he
saw
by
a
clock
on
*NL*
the
wall
that
it
was
ten
minutes
past
seven
.
He
had
to
make
haste
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
to
go
someway
round
,
so
as
to
approach
the
house
from
the
*NL*
other
side
...
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
happened
to
imagine
all
this
beforehand
,
he
had
sometimes
*NL*
thought
that
he
would
be
very
much
afraid
.
But
he
was
not
very
much
*NL*
afraid
now
,
was
not
afraid
at
all
,
indeed
.
His
mind
was
even
occupied
*NL*
by
irrelevant
matters
,
but
by
nothing
for
long
.
As
he
passed
the
Yusupov
*NL*
garden
,
he
was
deeply
absorbed
in
considering
the
building
of
great
*NL*
fountains
,
and
of
their
refreshing
effect
on
the
atmosphere
in
all
*NL*
the
squares
.
By
degrees
he
passed
to
the
conviction
that
if
the
summer
*NL*
garden
were
extended
to
the
field
of
Mars
,
and
perhaps
joined
to
the
*NL*
garden
of
the
Mihailovsky
Palace
,
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
and
a
*NL*
great
benefit
to
the
town
.
Then
he
was
interested
by
the
question
why
*NL*
in
all
great
towns
men
are
not
simply
driven
by
necessity
,
but
in
some
*NL*
peculiar
way
inclined
to
live
in
those
parts
of
the
town
where
there
*NL*
are
no
gardens
nor
fountains
;
where
there
is
most
dirt
and
smell
and
all
*NL*
sorts
of
nastiness
.
Then
his
own
walks
through
the
Hay
Market
came
back
*NL*
to
his
mind
,
and
for
a
moment
he
waked
up
to
reality
.
``
What
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
he
thought
,
``
better
think
of
nothing
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
probably
men
led
to
execution
clutch
mentally
at
every
object
that
*NL*
meets
them
on
the
way
,
''
flashed
through
his
mind
,
but
simply
flashed
,
*NL*
like
lightning
;
he
made
haste
to
dismiss
this
thought
...
And
by
now
*NL*
he
was
near
;
here
was
the
house
,
here
was
the
gate
.
Suddenly
a
clock
*NL*
somewhere
struck
once
.
``
What
!
can
it
be
half-past
seven
?
Impossible
,
it
*NL*
must
be
fast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Luckily
for
him
,
everything
went
well
again
at
the
gates
.
At
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
as
though
expressly
for
his
benefit
,
a
huge
waggon
of
hay
had
*NL*
just
driven
in
at
the
gate
,
completely
screening
him
as
he
passed
under
*NL*
the
gateway
,
and
the
waggon
had
scarcely
had
time
to
drive
through
into
*NL*
the
yard
,
before
he
had
slipped
in
a
flash
to
the
right
.
On
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
waggon
he
could
hear
shouting
and
quarrelling
;
but
no
one
*NL*
noticed
him
and
no
one
met
him
.
Many
windows
looking
into
that
huge
*NL*
quadrangular
yard
were
open
at
that
moment
,
but
he
did
not
raise
his
*NL*
head
--
he
had
not
the
strength
to
.
The
staircase
leading
to
the
old
*NL*
woman
's
room
was
close
by
,
just
on
the
right
of
the
gateway
.
He
was
*NL*
already
on
the
stairs
...
*NL*
*NL*
Drawing
a
breath
,
pressing
his
hand
against
his
throbbing
heart
,
and
*NL*
once
more
feeling
for
the
axe
and
setting
it
straight
,
he
began
softly
*NL*
and
cautiously
ascending
the
stairs
,
listening
every
minute
.
But
the
*NL*
stairs
,
too
,
were
quite
deserted
;
all
the
doors
were
shut
;
he
met
no
*NL*
one
.
One
flat
indeed
on
the
first
floor
was
wide
open
and
painters
were
*NL*
at
work
in
it
,
but
they
did
not
glance
at
him
.
He
stood
still
,
thought
*NL*
a
minute
and
went
on
.
``
Of
course
it
would
be
better
if
they
had
not
been
*NL*
here
,
but
...
it
's
two
storeys
above
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
the
fourth
storey
,
here
was
the
door
,
here
was
the
*NL*
flat
opposite
,
the
empty
one
.
The
flat
underneath
the
old
woman
's
was
*NL*
apparently
empty
also
;
the
visiting
card
nailed
on
the
door
had
been
*NL*
torn
off
--
they
had
gone
away
!
...
He
was
out
of
breath
.
For
one
instant
*NL*
the
thought
floated
through
his
mind
``
Shall
I
go
back
?
''
But
he
made
no
*NL*
answer
and
began
listening
at
the
old
woman
's
door
,
a
dead
silence
.
Then
*NL*
he
listened
again
on
the
staircase
,
listened
long
and
intently
...
*NL*
then
looked
about
him
for
the
last
time
,
pulled
himself
together
,
drew
*NL*
himself
up
,
and
once
more
tried
the
axe
in
the
noose
.
``
Am
I
very
pale
?
''
*NL*
he
wondered
.
``
Am
I
not
evidently
agitated
?
She
is
mistrustful
...
Had
I
*NL*
better
wait
a
little
longer
...
till
my
heart
leaves
off
thumping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
heart
did
not
leave
off
.
On
the
contrary
,
as
though
to
spite
*NL*
him
,
it
throbbed
more
and
more
violently
.
He
could
stand
it
no
longer
,
*NL*
he
slowly
put
out
his
hand
to
the
bell
and
rang
.
Half
a
minute
later
he
*NL*
rang
again
,
more
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
To
go
on
ringing
was
useless
and
out
of
place
.
The
old
woman
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
at
home
,
but
she
was
suspicious
and
alone
.
He
had
some
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
habits
...
and
once
more
he
put
his
ear
to
the
door
.
*NL*
Either
his
senses
were
peculiarly
keen
-LRB-
which
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
suppose
-RRB-
,
or
the
sound
was
really
very
distinct
.
Anyway
,
he
suddenly
*NL*
heard
something
like
the
cautious
touch
of
a
hand
on
the
lock
and
the
*NL*
rustle
of
a
skirt
at
the
very
door
.
Someone
was
standing
stealthily
*NL*
close
to
the
lock
and
just
as
he
was
doing
on
the
outside
was
secretly
*NL*
listening
within
,
and
seemed
to
have
her
ear
to
the
door
...
He
moved
*NL*
a
little
on
purpose
and
muttered
something
aloud
that
he
might
not
have
*NL*
the
appearance
of
hiding
,
then
rang
a
third
time
,
but
quietly
,
soberly
,
*NL*
and
without
impatience
,
Recalling
it
afterwards
,
that
moment
stood
out
*NL*
in
his
mind
vividly
,
distinctly
,
for
ever
;
he
could
not
make
out
how
he
*NL*
had
had
such
cunning
,
for
his
mind
was
as
it
were
clouded
at
moments
and
*NL*
he
was
almost
unconscious
of
his
body
...
An
instant
later
he
heard
the
*NL*
latch
unfastened
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
as
before
opened
a
tiny
crack
,
and
again
two
sharp
and
*NL*
suspicious
eyes
stared
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
.
Then
Raskolnikov
lost
*NL*
his
head
and
nearly
made
a
great
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fearing
the
old
woman
would
be
frightened
by
their
being
alone
,
and
not
*NL*
hoping
that
the
sight
of
him
would
disarm
her
suspicions
,
he
took
*NL*
hold
of
the
door
and
drew
it
towards
him
to
prevent
the
old
woman
from
*NL*
attempting
to
shut
it
again
.
Seeing
this
she
did
not
pull
the
door
back
,
*NL*
but
she
did
not
let
go
the
handle
so
that
he
almost
dragged
her
out
with
*NL*
it
on
to
the
stairs
.
Seeing
that
she
was
standing
in
the
doorway
not
*NL*
allowing
him
to
pass
,
he
advanced
straight
upon
her
.
She
stepped
back
*NL*
in
alarm
,
tried
to
say
something
,
but
seemed
unable
to
speak
and
stared
*NL*
with
open
eyes
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Alyona
Ivanovna
,
''
he
began
,
trying
to
speak
easily
,
but
*NL*
his
voice
would
not
obey
him
,
it
broke
and
shook
.
``
I
have
come
...
I
have
*NL*
brought
something
...
but
we
'd
better
come
in
...
to
the
light
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
leaving
her
,
he
passed
straight
into
the
room
uninvited
.
The
old
*NL*
woman
ran
after
him
;
her
tongue
was
unloosed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
What
it
is
?
Who
is
it
?
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Alyona
Ivanovna
,
you
know
me
...
Raskolnikov
...
here
,
I
brought
you
*NL*
the
pledge
I
promised
the
other
day
...
''
And
he
held
out
the
pledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
glanced
for
a
moment
at
the
pledge
,
but
at
once
stared
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
her
uninvited
visitor
.
She
looked
intently
,
maliciously
and
*NL*
mistrustfully
.
A
minute
passed
;
he
even
fancied
something
like
a
sneer
*NL*
in
her
eyes
,
as
though
she
had
already
guessed
everything
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
he
was
losing
his
head
,
that
he
was
almost
frightened
,
so
frightened
*NL*
that
if
she
were
to
look
like
that
and
not
say
a
word
for
another
half
*NL*
minute
,
he
thought
he
would
have
run
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
look
at
me
as
though
you
did
not
know
me
?
''
he
said
suddenly
,
*NL*
also
with
malice
.
``
Take
it
if
you
like
,
if
not
I
'll
go
elsewhere
,
I
am
*NL*
in
a
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
even
thought
of
saying
this
,
but
it
was
suddenly
said
of
*NL*
itself
.
The
old
woman
recovered
herself
,
and
her
visitor
's
resolute
tone
*NL*
evidently
restored
her
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
my
good
sir
,
all
of
a
minute
...
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
,
*NL*
looking
at
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
silver
cigarette
case
;
I
spoke
of
it
last
time
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
pale
you
are
,
to
be
sure
...
and
your
hands
are
trembling
too
?
*NL*
Have
you
been
bathing
,
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fever
,
''
he
answered
abruptly
.
``
You
ca
n't
help
getting
pale
...
if
you
've
*NL*
nothing
to
eat
,
''
he
added
,
with
difficulty
articulating
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
strength
was
failing
him
again
.
But
his
answer
sounded
like
the
*NL*
truth
;
the
old
woman
took
the
pledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
once
more
,
scanning
Raskolnikov
intently
,
and
*NL*
weighing
the
pledge
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thing
...
cigarette
case
...
Silver
...
Look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
not
seem
somehow
like
silver
...
How
he
has
wrapped
it
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Trying
to
untie
the
string
and
turning
to
the
window
,
to
the
light
-LRB-
all
*NL*
her
windows
were
shut
,
in
spite
of
the
stifling
heat
-RRB-
,
she
left
*NL*
him
altogether
for
some
seconds
and
stood
with
her
back
to
him
.
He
*NL*
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
freed
the
axe
from
the
noose
,
but
did
not
yet
*NL*
take
it
out
altogether
,
simply
holding
it
in
his
right
hand
under
the
*NL*
coat
.
His
hands
were
fearfully
weak
,
he
felt
them
every
moment
growing
*NL*
more
numb
and
more
wooden
.
He
was
afraid
he
would
let
the
axe
slip
and
*NL*
fall
...
A
sudden
giddiness
came
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
he
tied
it
up
like
this
for
?
''
the
old
woman
cried
with
*NL*
vexation
and
moved
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
a
minute
more
to
lose
.
He
pulled
the
axe
quite
out
,
swung
*NL*
it
with
both
arms
,
scarcely
conscious
of
himself
,
and
almost
without
*NL*
effort
,
almost
mechanically
,
brought
the
blunt
side
down
on
her
head
.
He
*NL*
seemed
not
to
use
his
own
strength
in
this
.
But
as
soon
as
he
had
once
*NL*
brought
the
axe
down
,
his
strength
returned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
was
as
always
bareheaded
.
Her
thin
,
light
hair
,
streaked
*NL*
with
grey
,
thickly
smeared
with
grease
,
was
plaited
in
a
rat
's
tail
and
*NL*
fastened
by
a
broken
horn
comb
which
stood
out
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
.
*NL*
As
she
was
so
short
,
the
blow
fell
on
the
very
top
of
her
skull
.
She
*NL*
cried
out
,
but
very
faintly
,
and
suddenly
sank
all
of
a
heap
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
raising
her
hands
to
her
head
.
In
one
hand
she
still
held
``
the
*NL*
pledge
.
''
Then
he
dealt
her
another
and
another
blow
with
the
blunt
side
*NL*
and
on
the
same
spot
.
The
blood
gushed
as
from
an
overturned
glass
,
the
*NL*
body
fell
back
.
He
stepped
back
,
let
it
fall
,
and
at
once
bent
over
her
*NL*
face
;
she
was
dead
.
Her
eyes
seemed
to
be
starting
out
of
their
sockets
,
*NL*
the
brow
and
the
whole
face
were
drawn
and
contorted
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
the
axe
on
the
ground
near
the
dead
body
and
felt
at
once
in
her
*NL*
pocket
-LRB-
trying
to
avoid
the
streaming
body
-RRB-
--
the
same
right-hand
pocket
*NL*
from
which
she
had
taken
the
key
on
his
last
visit
.
He
was
in
full
*NL*
possession
of
his
faculties
,
free
from
confusion
or
giddiness
,
but
his
*NL*
hands
were
still
trembling
.
He
remembered
afterwards
that
he
had
been
*NL*
particularly
collected
and
careful
,
trying
all
the
time
not
to
get
*NL*
smeared
with
blood
...
He
pulled
out
the
keys
at
once
,
they
were
all
,
*NL*
as
before
,
in
one
bunch
on
a
steel
ring
.
He
ran
at
once
into
the
bedroom
*NL*
with
them
.
It
was
a
very
small
room
with
a
whole
shrine
of
holy
images
.
*NL*
Against
the
other
wall
stood
a
big
bed
,
very
clean
and
covered
with
*NL*
a
silk
patchwork
wadded
quilt
.
Against
a
third
wall
was
a
chest
of
*NL*
drawers
.
Strange
to
say
,
so
soon
as
he
began
to
fit
the
keys
into
the
*NL*
chest
,
so
soon
as
he
heard
their
jingling
,
a
convulsive
shudder
passed
*NL*
over
him
.
He
suddenly
felt
tempted
again
to
give
it
all
up
and
go
*NL*
away
.
But
that
was
only
for
an
instant
;
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
.
*NL*
He
positively
smiled
at
himself
,
when
suddenly
another
terrifying
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
his
mind
.
He
suddenly
fancied
that
the
old
woman
might
be
*NL*
still
alive
and
might
recover
her
senses
.
Leaving
the
keys
in
the
chest
,
*NL*
he
ran
back
to
the
body
,
snatched
up
the
axe
and
lifted
it
once
more
*NL*
over
the
old
woman
,
but
did
not
bring
it
down
.
There
was
no
doubt
that
*NL*
she
was
dead
.
Bending
down
and
examining
her
again
more
closely
,
he
saw
*NL*
clearly
that
the
skull
was
broken
and
even
battered
in
on
one
side
.
He
*NL*
was
about
to
feel
it
with
his
finger
,
but
drew
back
his
hand
and
indeed
*NL*
it
was
evident
without
that
.
Meanwhile
there
was
a
perfect
pool
of
*NL*
blood
.
All
at
once
he
noticed
a
string
on
her
neck
;
he
tugged
at
it
,
but
*NL*
the
string
was
strong
and
did
not
snap
and
besides
,
it
was
soaked
*NL*
with
blood
.
He
tried
to
pull
it
out
from
the
front
of
the
dress
,
but
*NL*
something
held
it
and
prevented
its
coming
.
In
his
impatience
he
raised
*NL*
the
axe
again
to
cut
the
string
from
above
on
the
body
,
but
did
not
*NL*
dare
,
and
with
difficulty
,
smearing
his
hand
and
the
axe
in
the
blood
,
*NL*
after
two
minutes
'
hurried
effort
,
he
cut
the
string
and
took
it
off
*NL*
without
touching
the
body
with
the
axe
;
he
was
not
mistaken
--
it
was
a
*NL*
purse
.
On
the
string
were
two
crosses
,
one
of
Cyprus
wood
and
one
of
*NL*
copper
,
and
an
image
in
silver
filigree
,
and
with
them
a
small
greasy
*NL*
chamois
leather
purse
with
a
steel
rim
and
ring
.
The
purse
was
stuffed
*NL*
very
full
;
Raskolnikov
thrust
it
in
his
pocket
without
looking
at
it
,
*NL*
flung
the
crosses
on
the
old
woman
's
body
and
rushed
back
into
the
*NL*
bedroom
,
this
time
taking
the
axe
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
terrible
haste
,
he
snatched
the
keys
,
and
began
trying
them
*NL*
again
.
But
he
was
unsuccessful
.
They
would
not
fit
in
the
locks
.
It
*NL*
was
not
so
much
that
his
hands
were
shaking
,
but
that
he
kept
making
*NL*
mistakes
;
though
he
saw
for
instance
that
a
key
was
not
the
right
one
*NL*
and
would
not
fit
,
still
he
tried
to
put
it
in
.
Suddenly
he
remembered
*NL*
and
realised
that
the
big
key
with
the
deep
notches
,
which
was
hanging
*NL*
there
with
the
small
keys
could
not
possibly
belong
to
the
chest
of
*NL*
drawers
-LRB-
on
his
last
visit
this
had
struck
him
-RRB-
,
but
to
some
strong
box
,
*NL*
and
that
everything
perhaps
was
hidden
in
that
box
.
He
left
the
chest
*NL*
of
drawers
,
and
at
once
felt
under
the
bedstead
,
knowing
that
old
*NL*
women
usually
keep
boxes
under
their
beds
.
And
so
it
was
;
there
was
a
*NL*
good-sized
box
under
the
bed
,
at
least
a
yard
in
length
,
with
an
arched
*NL*
lid
covered
with
red
leather
and
studded
with
steel
nails
.
The
notched
*NL*
key
fitted
at
once
and
unlocked
it
.
At
the
top
,
under
a
white
sheet
,
was
*NL*
a
coat
of
red
brocade
lined
with
hareskin
;
under
it
was
a
silk
dress
,
*NL*
then
a
shawl
and
it
seemed
as
though
there
was
nothing
below
but
*NL*
clothes
.
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
wipe
his
blood-stained
hands
on
*NL*
the
red
brocade
.
``
It
's
red
,
and
on
red
blood
will
be
less
noticeable
,
''
*NL*
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
;
then
he
suddenly
came
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
am
I
going
out
of
my
senses
?
''
he
thought
with
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
sooner
did
he
touch
the
clothes
than
a
gold
watch
slipped
from
*NL*
under
the
fur
coat
.
He
made
haste
to
turn
them
all
over
.
There
turned
*NL*
out
to
be
various
articles
made
of
gold
among
the
clothes
--
probably
*NL*
all
pledges
,
unredeemed
or
waiting
to
be
redeemed
--
bracelets
,
chains
,
*NL*
ear-rings
,
pins
and
such
things
.
Some
were
in
cases
,
others
simply
*NL*
wrapped
in
newspaper
,
carefully
and
exactly
folded
,
and
tied
round
with
*NL*
tape
.
Without
any
delay
,
he
began
filling
up
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
*NL*
and
overcoat
without
examining
or
undoing
the
parcels
and
cases
;
but
he
*NL*
had
not
time
to
take
many
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
heard
steps
in
the
room
where
the
old
woman
lay
.
He
stopped
*NL*
short
and
was
still
as
death
.
But
all
was
quiet
,
so
it
must
have
been
*NL*
his
fancy
.
All
at
once
he
heard
distinctly
a
faint
cry
,
as
though
*NL*
someone
had
uttered
a
low
broken
moan
.
Then
again
dead
silence
for
*NL*
a
minute
or
two
.
He
sat
squatting
on
his
heels
by
the
box
and
waited
*NL*
holding
his
breath
.
Suddenly
he
jumped
up
,
seized
the
axe
and
ran
out
of
*NL*
the
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
Lizaveta
with
a
big
bundle
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
She
was
gazing
in
stupefaction
at
her
murdered
sister
,
white
as
a
sheet
*NL*
and
seeming
not
to
have
the
strength
to
cry
out
.
Seeing
him
run
out
*NL*
of
the
bedroom
,
she
began
faintly
quivering
all
over
,
like
a
leaf
,
a
*NL*
shudder
ran
down
her
face
;
she
lifted
her
hand
,
opened
her
mouth
,
but
*NL*
still
did
not
scream
.
She
began
slowly
backing
away
from
him
into
the
*NL*
corner
,
staring
intently
,
persistently
at
him
,
but
still
uttered
no
*NL*
sound
,
as
though
she
could
not
get
breath
to
scream
.
He
rushed
at
her
*NL*
with
the
axe
;
her
mouth
twitched
piteously
,
as
one
sees
babies
'
mouths
,
*NL*
when
they
begin
to
be
frightened
,
stare
intently
at
what
frightens
them
*NL*
and
are
on
the
point
of
screaming
.
And
this
hapless
Lizaveta
was
so
*NL*
simple
and
had
been
so
thoroughly
crushed
and
scared
that
she
did
not
*NL*
even
raise
a
hand
to
guard
her
face
,
though
that
was
the
most
necessary
*NL*
and
natural
action
at
the
moment
,
for
the
axe
was
raised
over
her
face
.
*NL*
She
only
put
up
her
empty
left
hand
,
but
not
to
her
face
,
slowly
holding
*NL*
it
out
before
her
as
though
motioning
him
away
.
The
axe
fell
with
the
*NL*
sharp
edge
just
on
the
skull
and
split
at
one
blow
all
the
top
of
the
*NL*
head
.
She
fell
heavily
at
once
.
Raskolnikov
completely
lost
his
head
,
*NL*
snatching
up
her
bundle
,
dropped
it
again
and
ran
into
the
entry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fear
gained
more
and
more
mastery
over
him
,
especially
after
this
*NL*
second
,
quite
unexpected
murder
.
He
longed
to
run
away
from
the
place
*NL*
as
fast
as
possible
.
And
if
at
that
moment
he
had
been
capable
of
seeing
*NL*
and
reasoning
more
correctly
,
if
he
had
been
able
to
realise
all
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
his
position
,
the
hopelessness
,
the
hideousness
and
the
*NL*
absurdity
of
it
,
if
he
could
have
understood
how
many
obstacles
and
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
crimes
he
had
still
to
overcome
or
to
commit
,
to
get
out
of
*NL*
that
place
and
to
make
his
way
home
,
it
is
very
possible
that
he
would
*NL*
have
flung
up
everything
,
and
would
have
gone
to
give
himself
up
,
and
*NL*
not
from
fear
,
but
from
simple
horror
and
loathing
of
what
he
had
*NL*
done
.
The
feeling
of
loathing
especially
surged
up
within
him
and
grew
*NL*
stronger
every
minute
.
He
would
not
now
have
gone
to
the
box
or
even
*NL*
into
the
room
for
anything
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
sort
of
blankness
,
even
dreaminess
,
had
begun
by
degrees
to
take
*NL*
possession
of
him
;
at
moments
he
forgot
himself
,
or
rather
,
forgot
what
*NL*
was
of
importance
,
and
caught
at
trifles
.
Glancing
,
however
,
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
and
seeing
a
bucket
half
full
of
water
on
a
bench
,
he
bethought
*NL*
him
of
washing
his
hands
and
the
axe
.
His
hands
were
sticky
with
blood
.
*NL*
He
dropped
the
axe
with
the
blade
in
the
water
,
snatched
a
piece
of
soap
*NL*
that
lay
in
a
broken
saucer
on
the
window
,
and
began
washing
his
hands
*NL*
in
the
bucket
.
When
they
were
clean
,
he
took
out
the
axe
,
washed
the
*NL*
blade
and
spent
a
long
time
,
about
three
minutes
,
washing
the
wood
where
*NL*
there
were
spots
of
blood
rubbing
them
with
soap
.
Then
he
wiped
it
all
*NL*
with
some
linen
that
was
hanging
to
dry
on
a
line
in
the
kitchen
and
*NL*
then
he
was
a
long
while
attentively
examining
the
axe
at
the
window
.
*NL*
There
was
no
trace
left
on
it
,
only
the
wood
was
still
damp
.
He
*NL*
carefully
hung
the
axe
in
the
noose
under
his
coat
.
Then
as
far
as
was
*NL*
possible
,
in
the
dim
light
in
the
kitchen
,
he
looked
over
his
overcoat
,
*NL*
his
trousers
and
his
boots
.
At
the
first
glance
there
seemed
to
be
*NL*
nothing
but
stains
on
the
boots
.
He
wetted
the
rag
and
rubbed
the
boots
.
*NL*
But
he
knew
he
was
not
looking
thoroughly
,
that
there
might
be
something
*NL*
quite
noticeable
that
he
was
overlooking
.
He
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
,
lost
in
thought
.
Dark
agonising
ideas
rose
in
his
mind
--
the
idea
*NL*
that
he
was
mad
and
that
at
that
moment
he
was
incapable
of
reasoning
,
*NL*
of
protecting
himself
,
that
he
ought
perhaps
to
be
doing
something
*NL*
utterly
different
from
what
he
was
now
doing
.
``
Good
God
!
''
he
muttered
``
I
*NL*
must
fly
,
fly
,
''
and
he
rushed
into
the
entry
.
But
here
a
shock
of
terror
*NL*
awaited
him
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
and
gazed
and
could
not
believe
his
eyes
:
the
door
,
the
outer
*NL*
door
from
the
stairs
,
at
which
he
had
not
long
before
waited
and
rung
,
*NL*
was
standing
unfastened
and
at
least
six
inches
open
.
No
lock
,
no
bolt
,
*NL*
all
the
time
,
all
that
time
!
The
old
woman
had
not
shut
it
after
him
*NL*
perhaps
as
a
precaution
.
But
,
good
God
!
Why
,
he
had
seen
Lizaveta
*NL*
afterwards
!
And
how
could
he
,
how
could
he
have
failed
to
reflect
that
*NL*
she
must
have
come
in
somehow
!
She
could
not
have
come
through
the
wall
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
dashed
to
the
door
and
fastened
the
latch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
,
the
wrong
thing
again
!
I
must
get
away
,
get
away
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
unfastened
the
latch
,
opened
the
door
and
began
listening
on
the
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
a
long
time
.
Somewhere
far
away
,
it
might
be
in
the
gateway
,
*NL*
two
voices
were
loudly
and
shrilly
shouting
,
quarrelling
and
scolding
.
*NL*
``
What
are
they
about
?
''
He
waited
patiently
.
At
last
all
was
still
,
as
*NL*
though
suddenly
cut
off
;
they
had
separated
.
He
was
meaning
to
go
out
,
*NL*
but
suddenly
,
on
the
floor
below
,
a
door
was
noisily
opened
and
someone
*NL*
began
going
downstairs
humming
a
tune
.
``
How
is
it
they
all
make
such
*NL*
a
noise
?
''
flashed
through
his
mind
.
Once
more
he
closed
the
door
and
*NL*
waited
.
At
last
all
was
still
,
not
a
soul
stirring
.
He
was
just
taking
a
*NL*
step
towards
the
stairs
when
he
heard
fresh
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steps
sounded
very
far
off
,
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
but
*NL*
he
remembered
quite
clearly
and
distinctly
that
from
the
first
sound
he
*NL*
began
for
some
reason
to
suspect
that
this
was
someone
coming
_
there
_
,
*NL*
to
the
fourth
floor
,
to
the
old
woman
.
Why
?
Were
the
sounds
somehow
*NL*
peculiar
,
significant
?
The
steps
were
heavy
,
even
and
unhurried
.
Now
*NL*
_
he
_
had
passed
the
first
floor
,
now
he
was
mounting
higher
,
it
was
*NL*
growing
more
and
more
distinct
!
He
could
hear
his
heavy
breathing
.
And
*NL*
now
the
third
storey
had
been
reached
.
Coming
here
!
And
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
all
at
once
that
he
was
turned
to
stone
,
that
it
was
like
a
dream
*NL*
in
which
one
is
being
pursued
,
nearly
caught
and
will
be
killed
,
and
is
*NL*
rooted
to
the
spot
and
can
not
even
move
one
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
when
the
unknown
was
mounting
to
the
fourth
floor
,
he
suddenly
*NL*
started
,
and
succeeded
in
slipping
neatly
and
quickly
back
into
the
*NL*
flat
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
.
Then
he
took
the
hook
and
softly
,
*NL*
noiselessly
,
fixed
it
in
the
catch
.
Instinct
helped
him
.
When
he
had
*NL*
done
this
,
he
crouched
holding
his
breath
,
by
the
door
.
The
unknown
*NL*
visitor
was
by
now
also
at
the
door
.
They
were
now
standing
opposite
one
*NL*
another
,
as
he
had
just
before
been
standing
with
the
old
woman
,
when
*NL*
the
door
divided
them
and
he
was
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
panted
several
times
.
``
He
must
be
a
big
,
fat
man
,
''
thought
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
squeezing
the
axe
in
his
hand
.
It
seemed
like
a
dream
*NL*
indeed
.
The
visitor
took
hold
of
the
bell
and
rang
it
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
tin
bell
tinkled
,
Raskolnikov
seemed
to
be
aware
of
*NL*
something
moving
in
the
room
.
For
some
seconds
he
listened
quite
*NL*
seriously
.
The
unknown
rang
again
,
waited
and
suddenly
tugged
violently
*NL*
and
impatiently
at
the
handle
of
the
door
.
Raskolnikov
gazed
in
horror
*NL*
at
the
hook
shaking
in
its
fastening
,
and
in
blank
terror
expected
every
*NL*
minute
that
the
fastening
would
be
pulled
out
.
It
certainly
did
seem
*NL*
possible
,
so
violently
was
he
shaking
it
.
He
was
tempted
to
hold
the
*NL*
fastening
,
but
_
he
_
might
be
aware
of
it
.
A
giddiness
came
over
him
*NL*
again
.
``
I
shall
fall
down
!
''
flashed
through
his
mind
,
but
the
unknown
*NL*
began
to
speak
and
he
recovered
himself
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
up
?
Are
they
asleep
or
murdered
?
D-damn
them
!
''
he
bawled
in
a
*NL*
thick
voice
,
``
Hey
,
Alyona
Ivanovna
,
old
witch
!
Lizaveta
Ivanovna
,
hey
,
*NL*
my
beauty
!
open
the
door
!
Oh
,
damn
them
!
Are
they
asleep
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
,
enraged
,
he
tugged
with
all
his
might
a
dozen
times
at
*NL*
the
bell
.
He
must
certainly
be
a
man
of
authority
and
an
intimate
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
light
hurried
steps
were
heard
not
far
off
,
on
the
*NL*
stairs
.
Someone
else
was
approaching
.
Raskolnikov
had
not
heard
them
at
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
there
's
no
one
at
home
,
''
the
new-comer
cried
in
a
*NL*
cheerful
,
ringing
voice
,
addressing
the
first
visitor
,
who
still
went
on
*NL*
pulling
the
bell
.
``
Good
evening
,
Koch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
his
voice
he
must
be
quite
young
,
''
thought
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
the
devil
can
tell
?
I
've
almost
broken
the
lock
,
''
answered
Koch
.
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
come
to
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
The
day
before
yesterday
I
beat
you
three
times
running
at
*NL*
billiards
at
Gambrinus
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
are
not
at
home
?
That
's
queer
.
It
's
awfully
stupid
though
.
*NL*
Where
could
the
old
woman
have
gone
?
I
've
come
on
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
I
have
business
with
her
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
can
we
do
?
Go
back
,
I
suppose
,
Aie
--
aie
!
And
I
was
hoping
to
*NL*
get
some
money
!
''
cried
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
give
it
up
,
of
course
,
but
what
did
she
fix
this
time
for
?
The
*NL*
old
witch
fixed
the
time
for
me
to
come
herself
.
It
's
out
of
my
way
.
*NL*
And
where
the
devil
she
can
have
got
to
,
I
ca
n't
make
out
.
She
sits
here
*NL*
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
,
the
old
hag
;
her
legs
are
bad
and
yet
*NL*
here
all
of
a
sudden
she
is
out
for
a
walk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
we
better
ask
the
porter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
she
's
gone
and
when
she
'll
be
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
Damn
it
all
!
...
We
might
ask
...
But
you
know
she
never
does
go
*NL*
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
once
more
tugged
at
the
door-handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
.
There
's
nothing
to
be
done
,
we
must
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
cried
the
young
man
suddenly
.
``
Do
you
see
how
the
door
shakes
if
*NL*
you
pull
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shows
it
's
not
locked
,
but
fastened
with
the
hook
!
Do
you
hear
how
*NL*
the
hook
clanks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
see
?
That
proves
that
one
of
them
is
at
home
.
If
they
*NL*
were
all
out
,
they
would
have
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
with
the
*NL*
key
and
not
with
the
hook
from
inside
.
There
,
do
you
hear
how
the
hook
*NL*
is
clanking
?
To
fasten
the
hook
on
the
inside
they
must
be
at
home
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
.
So
there
they
are
sitting
inside
and
do
n't
open
the
*NL*
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
And
so
they
must
be
!
''
cried
Koch
,
astonished
.
``
What
are
they
*NL*
about
in
there
?
''
And
he
began
furiously
shaking
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
cried
the
young
man
again
.
``
Do
n't
pull
at
it
!
There
must
be
*NL*
something
wrong
...
Here
,
you
've
been
ringing
and
pulling
at
the
door
*NL*
and
still
they
do
n't
open
!
So
either
they
've
both
fainted
or
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
.
Let
's
go
fetch
the
porter
,
let
him
wake
them
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
going
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
.
You
stop
here
while
I
run
down
for
the
porter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'd
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
studying
the
law
you
see
!
It
's
evident
,
e-vi-dent
there
's
something
*NL*
wrong
here
!
''
the
young
man
cried
hotly
,
and
he
ran
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Koch
remained
.
Once
more
he
softly
touched
the
bell
which
gave
one
*NL*
tinkle
,
then
gently
,
as
though
reflecting
and
looking
about
him
,
began
*NL*
touching
the
door-handle
pulling
it
and
letting
it
go
to
make
sure
once
*NL*
more
that
it
was
only
fastened
by
the
hook
.
Then
puffing
and
panting
he
*NL*
bent
down
and
began
looking
at
the
keyhole
:
but
the
key
was
in
the
lock
*NL*
on
the
inside
and
so
nothing
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
stood
keeping
tight
hold
of
the
axe
.
He
was
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
delirium
.
He
was
even
making
ready
to
fight
when
they
should
come
in
.
*NL*
While
they
were
knocking
and
talking
together
,
the
idea
several
times
*NL*
occurred
to
him
to
end
it
all
at
once
and
shout
to
them
through
the
*NL*
door
.
Now
and
then
he
was
tempted
to
swear
at
them
,
to
jeer
at
them
,
*NL*
while
they
could
not
open
the
door
!
``
Only
make
haste
!
''
was
the
thought
*NL*
that
flashed
through
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
the
devil
is
he
about
?
...
''
Time
was
passing
,
one
minute
,
and
*NL*
another
--
no
one
came
.
Koch
began
to
be
restless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
?
''
he
cried
suddenly
and
in
impatience
deserting
his
*NL*
sentry
duty
,
he
,
too
,
went
down
,
hurrying
and
thumping
with
his
heavy
*NL*
boots
on
the
stairs
.
The
steps
died
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
What
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
unfastened
the
hook
,
opened
the
door
--
there
was
no
sound
.
*NL*
Abruptly
,
without
any
thought
at
all
,
he
went
out
,
closing
the
door
as
*NL*
thoroughly
as
he
could
,
and
went
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
gone
down
three
flights
when
he
suddenly
heard
a
loud
voice
*NL*
below
--
where
could
he
go
!
There
was
nowhere
to
hide
.
He
was
just
going
*NL*
back
to
the
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
there
!
Catch
the
brute
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
dashed
out
of
a
flat
below
,
shouting
,
and
rather
fell
than
ran
*NL*
down
the
stairs
,
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mitka
!
Mitka
!
Mitka
!
Mitka
!
Mitka
!
Blast
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shout
ended
in
a
shriek
;
the
last
sounds
came
from
the
yard
;
all
was
*NL*
still
.
But
at
the
same
instant
several
men
talking
loud
and
fast
began
*NL*
noisily
mounting
the
stairs
.
There
were
three
or
four
of
them
.
He
*NL*
distinguished
the
ringing
voice
of
the
young
man
.
``
Hey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Filled
with
despair
he
went
straight
to
meet
them
,
feeling
``
come
what
*NL*
must
!
''
If
they
stopped
him
--
all
was
lost
;
if
they
let
him
pass
--
all
was
*NL*
lost
too
;
they
would
remember
him
.
They
were
approaching
;
they
were
only
*NL*
a
flight
from
him
--
and
suddenly
deliverance
!
A
few
steps
from
him
on
the
*NL*
right
,
there
was
an
empty
flat
with
the
door
wide
open
,
the
flat
on
the
*NL*
second
floor
where
the
painters
had
been
at
work
,
and
which
,
as
though
*NL*
for
his
benefit
,
they
had
just
left
.
It
was
they
,
no
doubt
,
who
had
just
*NL*
run
down
,
shouting
.
The
floor
had
only
just
been
painted
,
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
room
stood
a
pail
and
a
broken
pot
with
paint
and
brushes
.
In
one
*NL*
instant
he
had
whisked
in
at
the
open
door
and
hidden
behind
the
wall
*NL*
and
only
in
the
nick
of
time
;
they
had
already
reached
the
landing
.
*NL*
Then
they
turned
and
went
on
up
to
the
fourth
floor
,
talking
loudly
.
He
*NL*
waited
,
went
out
on
tiptoe
and
ran
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
was
on
the
stairs
,
nor
in
the
gateway
.
He
passed
quickly
through
*NL*
the
gateway
and
turned
to
the
left
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
,
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
at
that
moment
they
were
at
the
*NL*
flat
,
that
they
were
greatly
astonished
at
finding
it
unlocked
,
as
*NL*
the
door
had
just
been
fastened
,
that
by
now
they
were
looking
at
the
*NL*
bodies
,
that
before
another
minute
had
passed
they
would
guess
and
*NL*
completely
realise
that
the
murderer
had
just
been
there
,
and
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
hiding
somewhere
,
slipping
by
them
and
escaping
.
They
would
*NL*
guess
most
likely
that
he
had
been
in
the
empty
flat
,
while
they
were
*NL*
going
upstairs
.
And
meanwhile
he
dared
not
quicken
his
pace
much
,
though
*NL*
the
next
turning
was
still
nearly
a
hundred
yards
away
.
``
Should
he
*NL*
slip
through
some
gateway
and
wait
somewhere
in
an
unknown
street
?
No
,
*NL*
hopeless
!
Should
he
fling
away
the
axe
?
Should
he
take
a
cab
?
Hopeless
,
*NL*
hopeless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
reached
the
turning
.
He
turned
down
it
more
dead
than
alive
.
*NL*
Here
he
was
half
way
to
safety
,
and
he
understood
it
;
it
was
less
risky
*NL*
because
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
,
and
he
was
lost
in
it
like
a
*NL*
grain
of
sand
.
But
all
he
had
suffered
had
so
weakened
him
that
he
could
*NL*
scarcely
move
.
Perspiration
ran
down
him
in
drops
,
his
neck
was
all
wet
.
*NL*
``
My
word
,
he
has
been
going
it
!
''
someone
shouted
at
him
when
he
came
out
*NL*
on
the
canal
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
only
dimly
conscious
of
himself
now
,
and
the
farther
he
went
the
*NL*
worse
it
was
.
He
remembered
however
,
that
on
coming
out
on
to
the
canal
*NL*
bank
,
he
was
alarmed
at
finding
few
people
there
and
so
being
more
*NL*
conspicuous
,
and
he
had
thought
of
turning
back
.
Though
he
was
almost
*NL*
falling
from
fatigue
,
he
went
a
long
way
round
so
as
to
get
home
from
*NL*
quite
a
different
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
fully
conscious
when
he
passed
through
the
gateway
of
his
*NL*
house
!
He
was
already
on
the
staircase
before
he
recollected
the
axe
.
*NL*
And
yet
he
had
a
very
grave
problem
before
him
,
to
put
it
back
and
to
*NL*
escape
observation
as
far
as
possible
in
doing
so
.
He
was
of
course
*NL*
incapable
of
reflecting
that
it
might
perhaps
be
far
better
not
to
*NL*
restore
the
axe
at
all
,
but
to
drop
it
later
on
in
somebody
's
yard
.
But
*NL*
it
all
happened
fortunately
,
the
door
of
the
porter
's
room
was
closed
*NL*
but
not
locked
,
so
that
it
seemed
most
likely
that
the
porter
was
at
*NL*
home
.
But
he
had
so
completely
lost
all
power
of
reflection
that
he
*NL*
walked
straight
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
If
the
porter
had
asked
him
,
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
would
perhaps
have
simply
handed
him
the
axe
.
But
*NL*
again
the
porter
was
not
at
home
,
and
he
succeeded
in
putting
the
axe
*NL*
back
under
the
bench
,
and
even
covering
it
with
the
chunk
of
wood
as
*NL*
before
.
He
met
no
one
,
not
a
soul
,
afterwards
on
the
way
to
his
room
;
*NL*
the
landlady
's
door
was
shut
.
When
he
was
in
his
room
,
he
flung
himself
*NL*
on
the
sofa
just
as
he
was
--
he
did
not
sleep
,
but
sank
into
blank
*NL*
forgetfulness
.
If
anyone
had
come
into
his
room
then
,
he
would
have
*NL*
jumped
up
at
once
and
screamed
.
Scraps
and
shreds
of
thoughts
were
*NL*
simply
swarming
in
his
brain
,
but
he
could
not
catch
at
one
,
he
could
*NL*
not
rest
on
one
,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
...

PART

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
lay
a
very
long
while
.
Now
and
then
he
seemed
to
wake
up
,
and
at
*NL*
such
moments
he
noticed
that
it
was
far
into
the
night
,
but
it
did
not
*NL*
occur
to
him
to
get
up
.
At
last
he
noticed
that
it
was
beginning
to
get
*NL*
light
.
He
was
lying
on
his
back
,
still
dazed
from
his
recent
oblivion
.
*NL*
Fearful
,
despairing
cries
rose
shrilly
from
the
street
,
sounds
which
he
*NL*
heard
every
night
,
indeed
,
under
his
window
after
two
o'clock
.
They
woke
*NL*
him
up
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
the
drunken
men
are
coming
out
of
the
taverns
,
''
he
thought
,
``
it
's
*NL*
past
two
o'clock
,
''
and
at
once
he
leaped
up
,
as
though
someone
had
*NL*
pulled
him
from
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Past
two
o'clock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
the
sofa
--
and
instantly
recollected
everything
!
All
at
*NL*
once
,
in
one
flash
,
he
recollected
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
moment
he
thought
he
was
going
mad
.
A
dreadful
chill
came
*NL*
over
him
;
but
the
chill
was
from
the
fever
that
had
begun
long
before
in
*NL*
his
sleep
.
Now
he
was
suddenly
taken
with
violent
shivering
,
so
that
his
*NL*
teeth
chattered
and
all
his
limbs
were
shaking
.
He
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
began
listening
--
everything
in
the
house
was
asleep
.
With
amazement
he
*NL*
gazed
at
himself
and
everything
in
the
room
around
him
,
wondering
how
he
*NL*
could
have
come
in
the
night
before
without
fastening
the
door
,
and
have
*NL*
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
without
undressing
,
without
even
taking
his
*NL*
hat
off
.
It
had
fallen
off
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
near
his
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
anyone
had
come
in
,
what
would
he
have
thought
?
That
I
'm
drunk
*NL*
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
to
the
window
.
There
was
light
enough
,
and
he
began
hurriedly
*NL*
looking
himself
all
over
from
head
to
foot
,
all
his
clothes
;
were
there
*NL*
no
traces
?
But
there
was
no
doing
it
like
that
;
shivering
with
cold
,
he
*NL*
began
taking
off
everything
and
looking
over
again
.
He
turned
everything
*NL*
over
to
the
last
threads
and
rags
,
and
mistrusting
himself
,
went
through
*NL*
his
search
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
,
no
trace
,
except
in
one
place
,
where
*NL*
some
thick
drops
of
congealed
blood
were
clinging
to
the
frayed
edge
*NL*
of
his
trousers
.
He
picked
up
a
big
claspknife
and
cut
off
the
frayed
*NL*
threads
.
There
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
remembered
that
the
purse
and
the
things
he
had
taken
out
of
*NL*
the
old
woman
's
box
were
still
in
his
pockets
!
He
had
not
thought
till
*NL*
then
of
taking
them
out
and
hiding
them
!
He
had
not
even
thought
of
them
*NL*
while
he
was
examining
his
clothes
!
What
next
?
Instantly
he
rushed
*NL*
to
take
them
out
and
fling
them
on
the
table
.
When
he
had
pulled
out
*NL*
everything
,
and
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
to
be
sure
there
was
*NL*
nothing
left
,
he
carried
the
whole
heap
to
the
corner
.
The
paper
had
*NL*
come
off
the
bottom
of
the
wall
and
hung
there
in
tatters
.
He
began
*NL*
stuffing
all
the
things
into
the
hole
under
the
paper
:
``
They
're
in
!
All
*NL*
out
of
sight
,
and
the
purse
too
!
''
he
thought
gleefully
,
getting
up
and
*NL*
gazing
blankly
at
the
hole
which
bulged
out
more
than
ever
.
Suddenly
*NL*
he
shuddered
all
over
with
horror
;
``
My
God
!
''
he
whispered
in
despair
:
*NL*
``
what
's
the
matter
with
me
?
Is
that
hidden
?
Is
that
the
way
to
hide
*NL*
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
reckoned
on
having
trinkets
to
hide
.
He
had
only
thought
of
*NL*
money
,
and
so
had
not
prepared
a
hiding-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
,
now
,
what
am
I
glad
of
?
''
he
thought
,
``
Is
that
hiding
things
?
*NL*
My
reason
's
deserting
me
--
simply
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
exhaustion
and
was
at
once
shaken
by
another
*NL*
unbearable
fit
of
shivering
.
Mechanically
he
drew
from
a
chair
beside
*NL*
him
his
old
student
's
winter
coat
,
which
was
still
warm
though
almost
in
*NL*
rags
,
covered
himself
up
with
it
and
once
more
sank
into
drowsiness
and
*NL*
delirium
.
He
lost
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
more
than
five
minutes
had
passed
when
he
jumped
up
a
second
time
,
*NL*
and
at
once
pounced
in
a
frenzy
on
his
clothes
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
go
to
sleep
again
with
nothing
done
?
Yes
,
yes
;
I
have
not
*NL*
taken
the
loop
off
the
armhole
!
I
forgot
it
,
forgot
a
thing
like
that
!
*NL*
Such
a
piece
of
evidence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
off
the
noose
,
hurriedly
cut
it
to
pieces
and
threw
the
bits
*NL*
among
his
linen
under
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pieces
of
torn
linen
could
n't
rouse
suspicion
,
whatever
happened
;
I
*NL*
think
not
,
I
think
not
,
any
way
!
''
he
repeated
,
standing
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
room
,
and
with
painful
concentration
he
fell
to
gazing
about
*NL*
him
again
,
at
the
floor
and
everywhere
,
trying
to
make
sure
he
had
not
*NL*
forgotten
anything
.
The
conviction
that
all
his
faculties
,
even
memory
,
*NL*
and
the
simplest
power
of
reflection
were
failing
him
,
began
to
be
an
*NL*
insufferable
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
it
is
n't
beginning
already
!
Surely
it
is
n't
my
punishment
coming
*NL*
upon
me
?
It
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
frayed
rags
he
had
cut
off
his
trousers
were
actually
lying
on
the
*NL*
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
where
anyone
coming
in
would
see
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
me
!
''
he
cried
again
,
like
one
distraught
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
strange
idea
entered
his
head
;
that
,
perhaps
,
all
his
clothes
*NL*
were
covered
with
blood
,
that
,
perhaps
,
there
were
a
great
many
*NL*
stains
,
but
that
he
did
not
see
them
,
did
not
notice
them
because
*NL*
his
perceptions
were
failing
,
were
going
to
pieces
...
his
reason
was
*NL*
clouded
...
Suddenly
he
remembered
that
there
had
been
blood
on
the
*NL*
purse
too
.
``
Ah
!
Then
there
must
be
blood
on
the
pocket
too
,
for
I
put
*NL*
the
wet
purse
in
my
pocket
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
flash
he
had
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
and
,
yes
!
--
there
were
*NL*
traces
,
stains
on
the
lining
of
the
pocket
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
my
reason
has
not
quite
deserted
me
,
so
I
still
have
some
sense
and
*NL*
memory
,
since
I
guessed
it
of
myself
,
''
he
thought
triumphantly
,
with
*NL*
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
;
``
it
's
simply
the
weakness
of
fever
,
a
moment
's
*NL*
delirium
,
''
and
he
tore
the
whole
lining
out
of
the
left
pocket
of
his
*NL*
trousers
.
At
that
instant
the
sunlight
fell
on
his
left
boot
;
on
the
*NL*
sock
which
poked
out
from
the
boot
,
he
fancied
there
were
traces
!
He
*NL*
flung
off
his
boots
;
``
traces
indeed
!
The
tip
of
the
sock
was
soaked
with
*NL*
blood
;
''
he
must
have
unwarily
stepped
into
that
pool
...
``
But
what
am
I
*NL*
to
do
with
this
now
?
Where
am
I
to
put
the
sock
and
rags
and
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gathered
them
all
up
in
his
hands
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
stove
?
But
they
would
ransack
the
stove
first
of
all
.
Burn
them
?
*NL*
But
what
can
I
burn
them
with
?
There
are
no
matches
even
.
No
,
better
*NL*
go
out
and
throw
it
all
away
somewhere
.
Yes
,
better
throw
it
away
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
again
,
``
and
at
once
,
this
minute
,
*NL*
without
lingering
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
head
sank
on
the
pillow
instead
.
Again
the
unbearable
icy
*NL*
shivering
came
over
him
;
again
he
drew
his
coat
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
a
long
while
,
for
some
hours
,
he
was
haunted
by
the
impulse
to
*NL*
``
go
off
somewhere
at
once
,
this
moment
,
and
fling
it
all
away
,
so
that
*NL*
it
may
be
out
of
sight
and
done
with
,
at
once
,
at
once
!
''
Several
times
*NL*
he
tried
to
rise
from
the
sofa
,
but
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thoroughly
waked
up
at
last
by
a
violent
knocking
at
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
,
do
,
are
you
dead
or
alive
?
He
keeps
sleeping
here
!
''
shouted
*NL*
Nastasya
,
banging
with
her
fist
on
the
door
.
``
For
whole
days
together
*NL*
he
's
snoring
here
like
a
dog
!
A
dog
he
is
too
.
Open
I
tell
you
.
It
's
*NL*
past
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
he
's
not
at
home
,
''
said
a
man
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
that
's
the
porter
's
voice
...
What
does
he
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
and
sat
on
the
sofa
.
The
beating
of
his
heart
was
a
*NL*
positive
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
who
can
have
latched
the
door
?
''
retorted
Nastasya
.
``
He
's
taken
to
*NL*
bolting
himself
in
!
As
if
he
were
worth
stealing
!
Open
,
you
stupid
,
wake
*NL*
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
they
want
?
Why
the
porter
?
All
's
discovered
.
Resist
or
open
?
*NL*
Come
what
may
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
half
rose
,
stooped
forward
and
unlatched
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
room
was
so
small
that
he
could
undo
the
latch
without
leaving
the
*NL*
bed
.
Yes
;
the
porter
and
Nastasya
were
standing
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasya
stared
at
him
in
a
strange
way
.
He
glanced
with
a
defiant
and
*NL*
desperate
air
at
the
porter
,
who
without
a
word
held
out
a
grey
folded
*NL*
paper
sealed
with
bottle-wax
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
notice
from
the
office
,
''
he
announced
,
as
he
gave
him
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
office
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
summons
to
the
police
office
,
of
course
.
You
know
which
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
police
?
...
What
for
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
tell
?
You
're
sent
for
,
so
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
at
him
attentively
,
looked
round
the
room
and
turned
to
*NL*
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
downright
ill
!
''
observed
Nastasya
,
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
.
*NL*
The
porter
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
.
``
He
's
been
in
a
fever
since
*NL*
yesterday
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
made
no
response
and
held
the
paper
in
his
hands
,
without
*NL*
opening
it
.
``
Do
n't
you
get
up
then
,
''
Nastasya
went
on
compassionately
,
*NL*
seeing
that
he
was
letting
his
feet
down
from
the
sofa
.
``
You
're
ill
,
and
*NL*
so
do
n't
go
;
there
's
no
such
hurry
.
What
have
you
got
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
;
in
his
right
hand
he
held
the
shreds
he
had
cut
from
his
*NL*
trousers
,
the
sock
,
and
the
rags
of
the
pocket
.
So
he
had
been
asleep
*NL*
with
them
in
his
hand
.
Afterwards
reflecting
upon
it
,
he
remembered
that
*NL*
half
waking
up
in
his
fever
,
he
had
grasped
all
this
tightly
in
his
hand
*NL*
and
so
fallen
asleep
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
rags
he
's
collected
and
sleeps
with
them
,
as
though
he
has
*NL*
got
hold
of
a
treasure
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Nastasya
went
off
into
her
hysterical
giggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
he
thrust
them
all
under
his
great
coat
and
fixed
his
*NL*
eyes
intently
upon
her
.
Far
as
he
was
from
being
capable
of
rational
*NL*
reflection
at
that
moment
,
he
felt
that
no
one
would
behave
like
that
*NL*
with
a
person
who
was
going
to
be
arrested
.
``
But
...
the
police
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
have
some
tea
!
Yes
?
I
'll
bring
it
,
there
's
some
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
...
I
'm
going
;
I
'll
go
at
once
,
''
he
muttered
,
getting
on
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
'll
never
get
downstairs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
the
porter
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
he
rushed
to
the
light
to
examine
the
sock
and
the
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
stains
,
but
not
very
noticeable
;
all
covered
with
dirt
,
*NL*
and
rubbed
and
already
discoloured
.
No
one
who
had
no
suspicion
could
*NL*
distinguish
anything
.
Nastasya
from
a
distance
could
not
have
noticed
,
*NL*
thank
God
!
''
Then
with
a
tremor
he
broke
the
seal
of
the
notice
and
began
*NL*
reading
;
he
was
a
long
while
reading
,
before
he
understood
.
It
was
an
*NL*
ordinary
summons
from
the
district
police-station
to
appear
that
day
at
*NL*
half-past
nine
at
the
office
of
the
district
superintendent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
has
such
a
thing
happened
?
I
never
have
anything
to
do
with
*NL*
the
police
!
And
why
just
to-day
?
''
he
thought
in
agonising
bewilderment
.
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
only
get
it
over
soon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
flinging
himself
on
his
knees
to
pray
,
but
broke
into
*NL*
laughter
--
not
at
the
idea
of
prayer
,
but
at
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
,
hurriedly
dressing
.
``
If
I
'm
lost
,
I
am
lost
,
I
do
n't
care
!
*NL*
Shall
I
put
the
sock
on
?
''
he
suddenly
wondered
,
``
it
will
get
dustier
*NL*
still
and
the
traces
will
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
sooner
had
he
put
it
on
than
he
pulled
it
off
again
in
loathing
*NL*
and
horror
.
He
pulled
it
off
,
but
reflecting
that
he
had
no
other
socks
,
*NL*
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
again
--
and
again
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
conventional
,
that
's
all
relative
,
merely
a
way
of
looking
*NL*
at
it
,
''
he
thought
in
a
flash
,
but
only
on
the
top
surface
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
while
he
was
shuddering
all
over
,
``
there
,
I
've
got
it
on
!
I
have
*NL*
finished
by
getting
it
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
laughter
was
quickly
followed
by
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
too
much
for
me
...
''
he
thought
.
His
legs
shook
.
``
From
fear
,
''
*NL*
he
muttered
.
His
head
swam
and
ached
with
fever
.
``
It
's
a
trick
!
They
*NL*
want
to
decoy
me
there
and
confound
me
over
everything
,
''
he
mused
,
as
*NL*
he
went
out
on
to
the
stairs
--
``
the
worst
of
it
is
I
'm
almost
*NL*
light-headed
...
I
may
blurt
out
something
stupid
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
stairs
he
remembered
that
he
was
leaving
all
the
things
just
as
*NL*
they
were
in
the
hole
in
the
wall
,
``
and
very
likely
,
it
's
on
purpose
*NL*
to
search
when
I
'm
out
,
''
he
thought
,
and
stopped
short
.
But
he
was
*NL*
possessed
by
such
despair
,
such
cynicism
of
misery
,
if
one
may
so
call
*NL*
it
,
that
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
went
on
.
``
Only
to
get
it
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
street
the
heat
was
insufferable
again
;
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
*NL*
fallen
all
those
days
.
Again
dust
,
bricks
and
mortar
,
again
the
stench
*NL*
from
the
shops
and
pot-houses
,
again
the
drunken
men
,
the
Finnish
*NL*
pedlars
and
half-broken-down
cabs
.
The
sun
shone
straight
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
so
that
it
hurt
him
to
look
out
of
them
,
and
he
felt
his
head
going
*NL*
round
--
as
a
man
in
a
fever
is
apt
to
feel
when
he
comes
out
into
the
*NL*
street
on
a
bright
sunny
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
turning
into
_
the
_
street
,
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
trepidation
he
looked
down
it
...
at
_
the
_
house
...
and
at
once
averted
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
question
me
,
perhaps
I
'll
simply
tell
,
''
he
thought
,
as
he
drew
*NL*
near
the
police-station
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
police-station
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
.
It
had
lately
been
*NL*
moved
to
new
rooms
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
new
house
.
He
had
been
once
*NL*
for
a
moment
in
the
old
office
but
long
ago
.
Turning
in
at
the
gateway
,
*NL*
he
saw
on
the
right
a
flight
of
stairs
which
a
peasant
was
mounting
with
*NL*
a
book
in
his
hand
.
``
A
house-porter
,
no
doubt
;
so
then
,
the
office
is
*NL*
here
,
''
and
he
began
ascending
the
stairs
on
the
chance
.
He
did
not
want
*NL*
to
ask
questions
of
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
in
,
fall
on
my
knees
,
and
confess
everything
...
''
he
thought
,
as
*NL*
he
reached
the
fourth
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
staircase
was
steep
,
narrow
and
all
sloppy
with
dirty
water
.
The
*NL*
kitchens
of
the
flats
opened
on
to
the
stairs
and
stood
open
almost
*NL*
the
whole
day
.
So
there
was
a
fearful
smell
and
heat
.
The
staircase
*NL*
was
crowded
with
porters
going
up
and
down
with
their
books
under
their
*NL*
arms
,
policemen
,
and
persons
of
all
sorts
and
both
sexes
.
The
door
of
*NL*
the
office
,
too
,
stood
wide
open
.
Peasants
stood
waiting
within
.
There
,
*NL*
too
,
the
heat
was
stifling
and
there
was
a
sickening
smell
of
fresh
*NL*
paint
and
stale
oil
from
the
newly
decorated
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
waiting
a
little
,
he
decided
to
move
forward
into
the
next
room
.
*NL*
All
the
rooms
were
small
and
low-pitched
.
A
fearful
impatience
drew
him
*NL*
on
and
on
.
No
one
paid
attention
to
him
.
In
the
second
room
some
*NL*
clerks
sat
writing
,
dressed
hardly
better
than
he
was
,
and
rather
a
*NL*
queer-looking
set
.
He
went
up
to
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
the
notice
he
had
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
student
?
''
the
man
asked
,
glancing
at
the
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
formerly
a
student
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
looked
at
him
,
but
without
the
slightest
interest
.
He
was
a
*NL*
particularly
unkempt
person
with
the
look
of
a
fixed
idea
in
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
would
be
no
getting
anything
out
of
him
,
because
he
has
no
*NL*
interest
in
anything
,
''
thought
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
there
to
the
head
clerk
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
pointing
towards
the
*NL*
furthest
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
into
that
room
--
the
fourth
in
order
;
it
was
a
small
room
and
*NL*
packed
full
of
people
,
rather
better
dressed
than
in
the
outer
rooms
.
*NL*
Among
them
were
two
ladies
.
One
,
poorly
dressed
in
mourning
,
sat
at
the
*NL*
table
opposite
the
chief
clerk
,
writing
something
at
his
dictation
.
*NL*
The
other
,
a
very
stout
,
buxom
woman
with
a
purplish-red
,
blotchy
face
,
*NL*
excessively
smartly
dressed
with
a
brooch
on
her
bosom
as
big
as
a
*NL*
saucer
,
was
standing
on
one
side
,
apparently
waiting
for
something
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
thrust
his
notice
upon
the
head
clerk
.
The
latter
glanced
*NL*
at
it
,
said
:
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
and
went
on
attending
to
the
lady
in
*NL*
mourning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
breathed
more
freely
.
``
It
ca
n't
be
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
he
began
to
regain
confidence
,
he
kept
urging
himself
to
have
*NL*
courage
and
be
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
foolishness
,
some
trifling
carelessness
,
and
I
may
betray
myself
!
*NL*
Hm
...
it
's
a
pity
there
's
no
air
here
,
''
he
added
,
``
it
's
stifling
...
It
*NL*
makes
one
's
head
dizzier
than
ever
...
and
one
's
mind
too
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
conscious
of
a
terrible
inner
turmoil
.
He
was
afraid
of
losing
*NL*
his
self-control
;
he
tried
to
catch
at
something
and
fix
his
mind
on
it
,
*NL*
something
quite
irrelevant
,
but
he
could
not
succeed
in
this
at
all
.
Yet
*NL*
the
head
clerk
greatly
interested
him
,
he
kept
hoping
to
see
through
him
*NL*
and
guess
something
from
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
very
young
man
,
about
two
and
twenty
,
with
a
dark
mobile
*NL*
face
that
looked
older
than
his
years
.
He
was
fashionably
dressed
and
*NL*
foppish
,
with
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
,
well
combed
and
pomaded
,
*NL*
and
wore
a
number
of
rings
on
his
well-scrubbed
fingers
and
a
gold
chain
*NL*
on
his
waistcoat
.
He
said
a
couple
of
words
in
French
to
a
foreigner
who
*NL*
was
in
the
room
,
and
said
them
fairly
correctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luise
Ivanovna
,
you
can
sit
down
,
''
he
said
casually
to
the
*NL*
gaily-dressed
,
purple-faced
lady
,
who
was
still
standing
as
though
not
*NL*
venturing
to
sit
down
,
though
there
was
a
chair
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ich
danke
,
''
said
the
latter
,
and
softly
,
with
a
rustle
of
silk
she
sank
*NL*
into
the
chair
.
Her
light
blue
dress
trimmed
with
white
lace
floated
*NL*
about
the
table
like
an
air-balloon
and
filled
almost
half
the
room
.
She
*NL*
smelt
of
scent
.
But
she
was
obviously
embarrassed
at
filling
half
*NL*
the
room
and
smelling
so
strongly
of
scent
;
and
though
her
smile
was
*NL*
impudent
as
well
as
cringing
,
it
betrayed
evident
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
in
mourning
had
done
at
last
,
and
got
up
.
All
at
once
,
with
*NL*
some
noise
,
an
officer
walked
in
very
jauntily
,
with
a
peculiar
swing
of
*NL*
his
shoulders
at
each
step
.
He
tossed
his
cockaded
cap
on
the
table
and
*NL*
sat
down
in
an
easy-chair
.
The
small
lady
positively
skipped
from
her
*NL*
seat
on
seeing
him
,
and
fell
to
curtsying
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
;
but
the
*NL*
officer
took
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
,
and
she
did
not
venture
to
*NL*
sit
down
again
in
his
presence
.
He
was
the
assistant
superintendent
.
He
*NL*
had
a
reddish
moustache
that
stood
out
horizontally
on
each
side
of
his
*NL*
face
,
and
extremely
small
features
,
expressive
of
nothing
much
except
*NL*
a
certain
insolence
.
He
looked
askance
and
rather
indignantly
at
*NL*
Raskolnikov
;
he
was
so
very
badly
dressed
,
and
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
humiliating
position
,
his
bearing
was
by
no
means
in
keeping
with
his
*NL*
clothes
.
Raskolnikov
had
unwarily
fixed
a
very
long
and
direct
look
on
*NL*
him
,
so
that
he
felt
positively
affronted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
shouted
,
apparently
astonished
that
such
a
ragged
*NL*
fellow
was
not
annihilated
by
the
majesty
of
his
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
summoned
...
by
a
notice
...
''
Raskolnikov
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
recovery
of
money
due
,
from
_
the
student
_
,
''
the
head
clerk
*NL*
interfered
hurriedly
,
tearing
himself
from
his
papers
.
``
Here
!
''
and
he
*NL*
flung
Raskolnikov
a
document
and
pointed
out
the
place
.
``
Read
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
?
What
money
?
''
thought
Raskolnikov
,
``
but
...
then
...
it
's
certainly
*NL*
not
_
that
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
trembled
with
joy
.
He
felt
sudden
intense
indescribable
relief
.
A
*NL*
load
was
lifted
from
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
,
what
time
were
you
directed
to
appear
,
sir
?
''
shouted
the
*NL*
assistant
superintendent
,
seeming
for
some
unknown
reason
more
and
more
*NL*
aggrieved
.
``
You
are
told
to
come
at
nine
,
and
now
it
's
twelve
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
notice
was
only
brought
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
answered
loudly
over
his
shoulder
.
To
his
own
surprise
he
,
too
,
grew
*NL*
suddenly
angry
and
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
it
.
``
And
it
's
enough
that
*NL*
I
have
come
here
ill
with
fever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
refrain
from
shouting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
shouting
,
I
'm
speaking
very
quietly
,
it
's
you
who
are
shouting
*NL*
at
me
.
I
'm
a
student
,
and
allow
no
one
to
shout
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
assistant
superintendent
was
so
furious
that
for
the
first
minute
he
*NL*
could
only
splutter
inarticulately
.
He
leaped
up
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
!
You
are
in
a
government
office
.
Do
n't
be
impudent
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
a
government
office
,
too
,
''
cried
Raskolnikov
,
``
and
you
're
*NL*
smoking
a
cigarette
as
well
as
shouting
,
so
you
are
showing
disrespect
*NL*
to
all
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
an
indescribable
satisfaction
at
having
said
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
clerk
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
.
The
angry
assistant
*NL*
superintendent
was
obviously
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
your
business
!
''
he
shouted
at
last
with
unnatural
loudness
.
*NL*
``
Kindly
make
the
declaration
demanded
of
you
.
Show
him
.
Alexandr
*NL*
Grigorievitch
.
There
is
a
complaint
against
you
!
You
do
n't
pay
your
*NL*
debts
!
You
're
a
fine
bird
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Raskolnikov
was
not
listening
now
;
he
had
eagerly
clutched
at
the
*NL*
paper
,
in
haste
to
find
an
explanation
.
He
read
it
once
,
and
a
second
*NL*
time
,
and
still
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
he
asked
the
head
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
for
the
recovery
of
money
on
an
I
O
U
,
a
writ
.
You
must
*NL*
either
pay
it
,
with
all
expenses
,
costs
and
so
on
,
or
give
a
written
*NL*
declaration
when
you
can
pay
it
,
and
at
the
same
time
an
undertaking
not
*NL*
to
leave
the
capital
without
payment
,
and
nor
to
sell
or
conceal
your
*NL*
property
.
The
creditor
is
at
liberty
to
sell
your
property
,
and
proceed
*NL*
against
you
according
to
the
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I.
.
.
am
not
in
debt
to
anyone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
our
business

Here

hundred

fifteen
*NL*

legally
attested

given
by

to
the
widow
of
the
assessor
Zarnitsyn
,
nine
*NL*
months
ago
,
and
paid
over
by
the
widow
Zarnitsyn
to
one
Mr.
Tchebarov
.
*NL*
We
therefore
summon
you
,
hereupon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
my
landlady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
she
is
your
landlady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
clerk
looked
at
him
with
a
condescending
smile
of
compassion
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
certain
triumph
,
as
at
a
novice
under
fire
*NL*
for
the
first
time
--
as
though
he
would
say
:
``
Well
,
how
do
you
feel
now
?
''
*NL*
But
what
did
he
care
now
for
an
I
O
U
,
for
a
writ
of
recovery
!
Was
that
*NL*
worth
worrying
about
now
,
was
it
worth
attention
even
!
He
stood
,
he
*NL*
read
,
he
listened
,
he
answered
,
he
even
asked
questions
himself
,
but
*NL*
all
mechanically
.
The
triumphant
sense
of
security
,
of
deliverance
from
*NL*
overwhelming
danger
,
that
was
what
filled
his
whole
soul
that
moment
*NL*
without
thought
for
the
future
,
without
analysis
,
without
suppositions
*NL*
or
surmises
,
without
doubts
and
without
questioning
.
It
was
an
instant
*NL*
of
full
,
direct
,
purely
instinctive
joy
.
But
at
that
very
moment
*NL*
something
like
a
thunderstorm
took
place
in
the
office
.
The
assistant
*NL*
superintendent
,
still
shaken
by
Raskolnikov
's
disrespect
,
still
fuming
*NL*
and
obviously
anxious
to
keep
up
his
wounded
dignity
,
pounced
on
the
*NL*
unfortunate
smart
lady
,
who
had
been
gazing
at
him
ever
since
he
came
in
*NL*
with
an
exceedingly
silly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shameful
hussy
!
''
he
shouted
suddenly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
-LRB-
The
*NL*
lady
in
mourning
had
left
the
office
.
-RRB-
``
What
was
going
on
at
your
house
*NL*
last
night

Eh
!
A
disgrace
again
,
you

a
scandal
to
the
whole
street

*NL*
Fighting
and
drinking
again
.
Do
you
want
the
house
of
correction
?
Why
,
*NL*
I
have
warned
you
ten
times
over
that
I
would
not
let
you
off
the
*NL*
eleventh

And
here
you

again

again

you
...
you
...
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
paper
fell
out
of
Raskolnikov
's
hands
,
and
he
looked
wildly
at
the
*NL*
smart
lady
who
was
so
unceremoniously
treated
.
But
he
soon
saw
what
it
*NL*
meant
,
and
at
once
began
to
find
positive
amusement
in
the
scandal
.
He
*NL*
listened
with
pleasure
,
so
that
he
longed
to
laugh
and
laugh
...
all
his
*NL*
nerves
were
on
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilya
Petrovitch
!
''
the
head
clerk
was
beginning
anxiously
,
but
stopped
*NL*
short
,
for
he
knew
from
experience
that
the
enraged
assistant
could
not
*NL*
be
stopped
except
by
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
smart
lady
,
at
first
she
positively
trembled
before
the
*NL*
storm
.
But
,
strange
to
say
,
the
more
numerous
and
violent
the
terms
of
*NL*
abuse
became
,
the
more
amiable
she
looked
,
and
the
more
seductive
the
*NL*
smiles
she
lavished
on
the
terrible
assistant
.
She
moved
uneasily
,
and
*NL*
curtsied
incessantly
,
waiting
impatiently
for
a
chance
of
putting
in
her
*NL*
word
:
and
at
last
she
found
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
sort
of
noise
or
fighting
in
my
house
,
Mr.
Captain
,
''
she
*NL*
pattered
all
at
once
,
like
peas
dropping
,
speaking
Russian
confidently
,
*NL*
though
with
a
strong
German
accent
,
``
and
no
sort
of
scandal
,
and
his
*NL*
honour
came
drunk
,
and
it
's
the
whole
truth
I
am
telling
,
Mr.
Captain
,
*NL*
and
I
am
not
to
blame
...
Mine
is
an
honourable
house
,
Mr.
Captain
,
*NL*
and
honourable
behaviour
,
Mr.
Captain
,
and
I
always
,
always
dislike
any
*NL*
scandal
myself
.
But
he
came
quite
tipsy
,
and
asked
for
three
bottles
*NL*
again
,
and
then
he
lifted
up
one
leg
,
and
began
playing
the
pianoforte
*NL*
with
one
foot
,
and
that
is
not
at
all
right
in
an
honourable
house
,
and
*NL*
he
_
ganz
_
broke
the
piano
,
and
it
was
very
bad
manners
indeed
and
I
said
*NL*
so
.
And
he
took
up
a
bottle
and
began
hitting
everyone
with
it
.
And
then
*NL*
I
called
the
porter
,
and
Karl
came
,
and
he
took
Karl
and
hit
him
in
the
*NL*
eye
;
and
he
hit
Henriette
in
the
eye
,
too
,
and
gave
me
five
slaps
on
the
*NL*
cheek
.
And
it
was
so
ungentlemanly
in
an
honourable
house
,
Mr.
Captain
,
*NL*
and
I
screamed
.
And
he
opened
the
window
over
the
canal
,
and
stood
in
*NL*
the
window
,
squealing
like
a
little
pig
;
it
was
a
disgrace
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
squealing
like
a
little
pig
at
the
window
into
the
street
!
Fie
upon
him
!
*NL*
And
Karl
pulled
him
away
from
the
window
by
his
coat
,
and
it
is
true
,
*NL*
Mr.
Captain
,
he
tore
_
sein
rock
_
.
And
then
he
shouted
that
_
man
muss
_
*NL*
pay
him
fifteen
roubles
damages
.
And
I
did
pay
him
,
Mr.
Captain
,
five
*NL*
roubles
for
_
sein
rock
_
.
And
he
is
an
ungentlemanly
visitor
and
caused
*NL*
all
the
scandal
.
'
I
will
show
you
up
,
'
he
said
,
`
for
I
can
write
to
all
*NL*
the
papers
about
you
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
was
an
author
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
Captain
,
and
what
an
ungentlemanly
visitor
in
an
honourable
*NL*
house
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
!
Enough
!
I
have
told
you
already
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilya
Petrovitch
!
''
the
head
clerk
repeated
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assistant
glanced
rapidly
at
him
;
the
head
clerk
slightly
shook
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
So
I
tell
you
this
,
most
respectable
Luise
Ivanovna
,
and
I
tell
it
*NL*
you
for
the
last
time
,
''
the
assistant
went
on
.
``
If
there
is
a
scandal
*NL*
in
your
honourable
house
once
again
,
I
will
put
you
yourself
in
the
*NL*
lock-up
,
as
it
is
called
in
polite
society
.
Do
you
hear
?
So
a
literary
*NL*
man
,
an
author
took
five
roubles
for
his
coat-tail
in
an
`
honourable
*NL*
house
'
?
A
nice
set
,
these
authors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
cast
a
contemptuous
glance
at
Raskolnikov
.
``
There
was
a
scandal
*NL*
the
other
day
in
a
restaurant
,
too
.
An
author
had
eaten
his
dinner
and
*NL*
would
not
pay
;
`
I
'll
write
a
satire
on
you
,
'
says
he
.
And
there
was
*NL*
another
of
them
on
a
steamer
last
week
used
the
most
disgraceful
*NL*
language
to
the
respectable
family
of
a
civil
councillor
,
his
wife
and
*NL*
daughter
.
And
there
was
one
of
them
turned
out
of
a
confectioner
's
shop
*NL*
the
other
day
.
They
are
like
that
,
authors
,
literary
men
,
students
,
*NL*
town-criers
...
Pfoo
!
You
get
along
!
I
shall
look
in
upon
you
myself
one
*NL*
day

Then
you
had
better
be
careful
!
Do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
hurried
deference
,
Luise
Ivanovna
fell
to
curtsying
in
all
*NL*
directions
,
and
so
curtsied
herself
to
the
door
.
But
at
the
door
,
she
*NL*
stumbled
backwards
against
a
good-looking
officer
with
a
fresh
,
open
*NL*
face
and
splendid
thick
fair
whiskers
.
This
was
the
superintendent
of
*NL*
the
district
himself
,
Nikodim
Fomitch
.
Luise
Ivanovna
made
haste
*NL*
to
curtsy
almost
to
the
ground
,
and
with
mincing
little
steps
,
she
*NL*
fluttered
out
of
the
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
thunder
and
lightning
--
a
hurricane
!
''
said
Nikodim
Fomitch
to
Ilya
*NL*
Petrovitch
in
a
civil
and
friendly
tone
.
``
You
are
aroused
again
,
you
are
*NL*
fuming
again
!
I
heard
it
on
the
stairs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
!
''
Ilya
Petrovitch
drawled
with
gentlemanly
nonchalance
;
*NL*
and
he
walked
with
some
papers
to
another
table
,
with
a
jaunty
swing
of
*NL*
his
shoulders
at
each
step
.
``
Here

you
will
kindly
look

an

does
not

has
given

an

out

and
complaints
are
constantly
*NL*
being
lodged
against

and
here
he
has
been
pleased
to
make
a
protest
*NL*
against

smoking
in

He
behaves
like

*NL*
just
look

Here

very

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poverty

I

you
took
offence

went

continued
Nikodim
Fomitch
,
turning
affably
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
``
But
you
were
wrong
there
;
he
is
a
capital
fellow

I
assure

you

He
gets
hot
,
fires
up

boils
over

and
no

stopping
him

And
then
it
's
all
over

And
at
the
bottom
he
's
a

His

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
a

it
was

too

cried
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
much
gratified
*NL*
at
this
agreeable
banter
,
though
still
sulky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
a
sudden
desire
to
say
something
exceptionally
pleasant
*NL*
to
them
all
.
``
Excuse
me

Captain

he
began
easily
,
suddenly
addressing
*NL*
Nikodim
Fomitch
,
``
will
you
enter
into
my

I
am
ready

*NL*
ask

I
am
a
poor

sick
*NL*
and
shattered

shattered

the
word
he
used
-RRB-
by
poverty

I
am
not
*NL*
studying

because
I
can
not
keep
myself
now

I

send

I
will

My
landlady
is
a
good-hearted
woman
,
but
she
is
so
*NL*
exasperated
at
my
having
lost
my
lessons
,
and
not
paying
her
for
the
*NL*
last
four
months

O
U

How
am
I
to
pay
her
?
Judge
for
yourselves
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
not
our
business
,
you
know
,
''
the
head
clerk
was
observing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
I
perfectly
agree
with
you
.
But
allow
me
to
explain
...
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
put
in
again
,
still
addressing
Nikodim
Fomitch
,
but
trying
*NL*
his
best
to
address
Ilya
Petrovitch
also
,
though
the
latter
persistently
*NL*
appeared
to
be
rummaging
among
his
papers
and
to
be
contemptuously
*NL*
oblivious
of
him
.
``
Allow
me
to
explain
that
I
have
been
living
with
her
*NL*
for
nearly
three
years
and
at
first
...
at
first
...
for
why
should
I
not
*NL*
confess
it
,
at
the
very
beginning
I
promised
to
marry
her
daughter
,
it
*NL*
was
a
verbal
promise
,
freely
given
...
she
was
a
girl
...
indeed
,
I
liked
*NL*
her
,
though
I
was
not
in
love
with
her
...
a
youthful
affair
in
fact
...
*NL*
that
is
,
I
mean
to
say
,
that
my
landlady
gave
me
credit
freely
in
those
*NL*
days
,
and
I
led
a
life
of
...
I
was
very
heedless
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
asks
you
for
these
personal
details
,
sir
,
we
've
no
time
to
*NL*
waste
,
''
Ilya
Petrovitch
interposed
roughly
and
with
a
note
of
triumph
;
*NL*
but
Raskolnikov
stopped
him
hotly
,
though
he
suddenly
found
it
*NL*
exceedingly
difficult
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
excuse
me
,
excuse
me
.
It
is
for
me
to
explain
...
how
it
all
*NL*
happened
...
In
my
turn
...
though
I
agree
with
you
...
it
is
unnecessary
.
*NL*
But
a
year
ago
,
the
girl
died
of
typhus
.
I
remained
lodging
there
as
*NL*
before
,
and
when
my
landlady
moved
into
her
present
quarters
,
she
said
*NL*
to
me
...
and
in
a
friendly
way
...
that
she
had
complete
trust
in
me
,
*NL*
but
still
,
would
I
not
give
her
an
I
O
U
for
one
hundred
and
fifteen
*NL*
roubles
,
all
the
debt
I
owed
her
.
She
said
if
only
I
gave
her
that
,
*NL*
she
would
trust
me
again
,
as
much
as
I
liked
,
and
that
she
would
never
,
*NL*
never
--
those
were
her
own
words
--
make
use
of
that
I
O
U
till
I
could
pay
*NL*
of
myself
...
and
now
,
when
I
have
lost
my
lessons
and
have
nothing
to
*NL*
eat
,
she
takes
action
against
me
.
What
am
I
to
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
these
affecting
details
are
no
business
of
ours
.
''
Ilya
Petrovitch
*NL*
interrupted
rudely
.
``
You
must
give
a
written
undertaking
but
as
for
your
*NL*
love
affairs
and
all
these
tragic
events
,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
...
you
are
harsh
,
''
muttered
Nikodim
Fomitch
,
sitting
down
at
*NL*
the
table
and
also
beginning
to
write
.
He
looked
a
little
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
!
''
said
the
head
clerk
to
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
what
?
''
the
latter
asked
,
gruffly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
dictate
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
fancied
that
the
head
clerk
treated
him
more
casually
and
*NL*
contemptuously
after
his
speech
,
but
strange
to
say
he
suddenly
felt
*NL*
completely
indifferent
to
anyone
's
opinion
,
and
this
revulsion
took
*NL*
place
in
a
flash
,
in
one
instant
.
If
he
had
cared
to
think
a
little
,
*NL*
he
would
have
been
amazed
indeed
that
he
could
have
talked
to
them
like
*NL*
that
a
minute
before
,
forcing
his
feelings
upon
them
.
And
where
had
*NL*
those
feelings
come
from
?
Now
if
the
whole
room
had
been
filled
,
not
*NL*
with
police
officers
,
but
with
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
,
he
*NL*
would
not
have
found
one
human
word
for
them
,
so
empty
was
his
heart
.
A
*NL*
gloomy
sensation
of
agonising
,
everlasting
solitude
and
remoteness
,
took
*NL*
conscious
form
in
his
soul
.
It
was
not
the
meanness
of
his
sentimental
*NL*
effusions
before
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
nor
the
meanness
of
the
latter
's
*NL*
triumph
over
him
that
had
caused
this
sudden
revulsion
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
Oh
,
what
had
he
to
do
now
with
his
own
baseness
,
with
all
these
petty
*NL*
vanities
,
officers
,
German
women
,
debts
,
police-offices
?
If
he
had
been
*NL*
sentenced
to
be
burnt
at
that
moment
,
he
would
not
have
stirred
,
would
*NL*
hardly
have
heard
the
sentence
to
the
end
.
Something
was
happening
to
*NL*
him
entirely
new
,
sudden
and
unknown
.
It
was
not
that
he
understood
,
but
*NL*
he
felt
clearly
with
all
the
intensity
of
sensation
that
he
could
*NL*
never
more
appeal
to
these
people
in
the
police-office
with
sentimental
*NL*
effusions
like
his
recent
outburst
,
or
with
anything
whatever
;
and
that
*NL*
if
they
had
been
his
own
brothers
and
sisters
and
not
police-officers
,
*NL*
it
would
have
been
utterly
out
of
the
question
to
appeal
to
them
in
any
*NL*
circumstance
of
life
.
He
had
never
experienced
such
a
strange
and
awful
*NL*
sensation
.
And
what
was
most
agonising
--
it
was
more
a
sensation
than
a
*NL*
conception
or
idea
,
a
direct
sensation
,
the
most
agonising
of
all
the
*NL*
sensations
he
had
known
in
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
clerk
began
dictating
to
him
the
usual
form
of
declaration
,
*NL*
that
he
could
not
pay
,
that
he
undertook
to
do
so
at
a
future
date
,
that
*NL*
he
would
not
leave
the
town
,
nor
sell
his
property
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
write
,
you
can
hardly
hold
the
pen
,
''
observed
the
head
*NL*
clerk
,
looking
with
curiosity
at
Raskolnikov
.
``
Are
you
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
giddy
.
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
.
Sign
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
clerk
took
the
paper
,
and
turned
to
attend
to
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
gave
back
the
pen
;
but
instead
of
getting
up
and
going
away
,
*NL*
he
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
pressed
his
head
in
his
hands
.
He
*NL*
felt
as
if
a
nail
were
being
driven
into
his
skull
.
A
strange
idea
*NL*
suddenly
occurred
to
him
,
to
get
up
at
once
,
to
go
up
to
Nikodim
*NL*
Fomitch
,
and
tell
him
everything
that
had
happened
yesterday
,
and
then
*NL*
to
go
with
him
to
his
lodgings
and
to
show
him
the
things
in
the
hole
*NL*
in
the
corner
.
The
impulse
was
so
strong
that
he
got
up
from
his
seat
*NL*
to
carry
it
out
.
``
Had
n't
I
better
think
a
minute
?
''
flashed
through
his
*NL*
mind
.
``
No
,
better
cast
off
the
burden
without
thinking
.
''
But
all
at
once
*NL*
he
stood
still
,
rooted
to
the
spot
.
Nikodim
Fomitch
was
talking
eagerly
*NL*
with
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
and
the
words
reached
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
,
they
'll
both
be
released
.
To
begin
with
,
the
whole
*NL*
story
contradicts
itself
.
Why
should
they
have
called
the
porter
,
if
it
*NL*
had
been
their
doing
?
To
inform
against
themselves
?
Or
as
a
blind
?
No
,
*NL*
that
would
be
too
cunning
!
Besides
,
Pestryakov
,
the
student
,
was
seen
at
*NL*
the
gate
by
both
the
porters
and
a
woman
as
he
went
in
.
He
was
walking
*NL*
with
three
friends
,
who
left
him
only
at
the
gate
,
and
he
asked
the
*NL*
porters
to
direct
him
,
in
the
presence
of
the
friends
.
Now
,
would
he
*NL*
have
asked
his
way
if
he
had
been
going
with
such
an
object
?
As
for
*NL*
Koch
,
he
spent
half
an
hour
at
the
silversmith
's
below
,
before
he
went
*NL*
up
to
the
old
woman
and
he
left
him
at
exactly
a
quarter
to
eight
.
Now
*NL*
just
consider
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
excuse
me
,
how
do
you
explain
this
contradiction
?
They
state
*NL*
themselves
that
they
knocked
and
the
door
was
locked
;
yet
three
minutes
*NL*
later
when
they
went
up
with
the
porter
,
it
turned
out
the
door
was
*NL*
unfastened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
it
;
the
murderer
must
have
been
there
and
bolted
himself
*NL*
in
;
and
they
'd
have
caught
him
for
a
certainty
if
Koch
had
not
been
*NL*
an
ass
and
gone
to
look
for
the
porter
too
.
_
He
_
must
have
seized
the
*NL*
interval
to
get
downstairs
and
slip
by
them
somehow
.
Koch
keeps
crossing
*NL*
himself
and
saying
:
`
If
I
had
been
there
,
he
would
have
jumped
out
and
*NL*
killed
me
with
his
axe
.
'
He
is
going
to
have
a
thanksgiving
service
--
ha
,
*NL*
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
no
one
saw
the
murderer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
might
well
not
see
him
;
the
house
is
a
regular
Noah
's
Ark
,
''
said
*NL*
the
head
clerk
,
who
was
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
clear
,
quite
clear
,
''
Nikodim
Fomitch
repeated
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
anything
but
clear
,
''
Ilya
Petrovitch
maintained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
picked
up
his
hat
and
walked
towards
the
door
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
reach
it
...
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
recovered
consciousness
,
he
found
himself
sitting
in
a
chair
,
*NL*
supported
by
someone
on
the
right
side
,
while
someone
else
was
standing
*NL*
on
the
left
,
holding
a
yellowish
glass
filled
with
yellow
water
,
and
*NL*
Nikodim
Fomitch
standing
before
him
,
looking
intently
at
him
.
He
got
up
*NL*
from
the
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
Are
you
ill
?
''
Nikodim
Fomitch
asked
,
rather
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
hardly
hold
his
pen
when
he
was
signing
,
''
said
the
head
clerk
,
*NL*
settling
back
in
his
place
,
and
taking
up
his
work
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
ill
long
?
''
cried
Ilya
Petrovitch
from
his
place
,
where
*NL*
he
,
too
,
was
looking
through
papers
.
He
had
,
of
course
,
come
to
look
at
*NL*
the
sick
man
when
he
fainted
,
but
retired
at
once
when
he
recovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
yesterday
,
''
muttered
Raskolnikov
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
go
out
yesterday
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Though
you
were
ill

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

At

*NL*
*NL*
``
About
seven

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
did
you
go

may
I
ask

*NL*
*NL*
``
Along
the
street

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Short
and
clear

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
white
as
a
handkerchief
,
had
answered
sharply
,
jerkily
,
*NL*
without
dropping
his
black
feverish
eyes
before
Ilya
Petrovitch
's
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
scarcely
stand
upright
.
And
you
...
''
Nikodim
Fomitch
was
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
''
Ilya
Petrovitch
pronounced
rather
peculiarly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nikodim
Fomitch
would
have
made
some
further
protest
,
but
glancing
at
*NL*
the
head
clerk
who
was
looking
very
hard
at
him
,
he
did
not
speak
.
There
*NL*
was
a
sudden
silence
.
It
was
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
concluded
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
``
we
will
not
detain
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
out
.
He
caught
the
sound
of
eager
conversation
on
his
*NL*
departure
,
and
above
the
rest
rose
the
questioning
voice
of
Nikodim
*NL*
Fomitch
.
In
the
street
,
his
faintness
passed
off
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
search
--
there
will
be
a
search
at
once
,
''
he
repeated
to
himself
,
*NL*
hurrying
home
.
``
The
brutes
!
they
suspect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
former
terror
mastered
him
completely
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
there
has
been
a
search
already
?
What
if
I
find
them
in
my
*NL*
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
was
his
room
.
Nothing
and
no
one
in
it
.
No
one
had
peeped
in
.
*NL*
Even
Nastasya
had
not
touched
it
.
But
heavens
!
how
could
he
have
left
*NL*
all
those
things
in
the
hole
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
to
the
corner
,
slipped
his
hand
under
the
paper
,
pulled
the
*NL*
things
out
and
lined
his
pockets
with
them
.
There
were
eight
articles
in
*NL*
all
:
two
little
boxes
with
ear-rings
or
something
of
the
sort
,
he
hardly
*NL*
looked
to
see
;
then
four
small
leather
cases
.
There
was
a
chain
,
too
,
*NL*
merely
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
something
else
in
newspaper
,
that
looked
*NL*
like
a
decoration
...
He
put
them
all
in
the
different
pockets
of
his
*NL*
overcoat
,
and
the
remaining
pocket
of
his
trousers
,
trying
to
conceal
*NL*
them
as
much
as
possible
.
He
took
the
purse
,
too
.
Then
he
went
out
of
*NL*
his
room
,
leaving
the
door
open
.
He
walked
quickly
and
resolutely
,
and
*NL*
though
he
felt
shattered
,
he
had
his
senses
about
him
.
He
was
afraid
of
*NL*
pursuit
,
he
was
afraid
that
in
another
half-hour
,
another
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
perhaps
,
instructions
would
be
issued
for
his
pursuit
,
and
so
at
*NL*
all
costs
,
he
must
hide
all
traces
before
then
.
He
must
clear
everything
*NL*
up
while
he
still
had
some
strength
,
some
reasoning
power
left
him
...
*NL*
Where
was
he
to
go
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
had
long
been
settled
:
``
Fling
them
into
the
canal
,
and
all
traces
*NL*
hidden
in
the
water
,
the
thing
would
be
at
an
end
.
''
So
he
had
decided
in
*NL*
the
night
of
his
delirium
when
several
times
he
had
had
the
impulse
to
*NL*
get
up
and
go
away
,
to
make
haste
,
and
get
rid
of
it
all
.
But
to
get
*NL*
rid
of
it
,
turned
out
to
be
a
very
difficult
task
.
He
wandered
along
*NL*
the
bank
of
the
Ekaterininsky
Canal
for
half
an
hour
or
more
and
looked
*NL*
several
times
at
the
steps
running
down
to
the
water
,
but
he
could
not
*NL*
think
of
carrying
out
his
plan
;
either
rafts
stood
at
the
steps
'
edge
,
*NL*
and
women
were
washing
clothes
on
them
,
or
boats
were
moored
there
,
and
*NL*
people
were
swarming
everywhere
.
Moreover
he
could
be
seen
and
noticed
*NL*
from
the
banks
on
all
sides
;
it
would
look
suspicious
for
a
man
to
go
*NL*
down
on
purpose
,
stop
,
and
throw
something
into
the
water
.
And
what
if
*NL*
the
boxes
were
to
float
instead
of
sinking
?
And
of
course
they
would
.
*NL*
Even
as
it
was
,
everyone
he
met
seemed
to
stare
and
look
round
,
as
if
*NL*
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
watch
him
.
``
Why
is
it
,
or
can
it
be
my
*NL*
fancy
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
thought
struck
him
that
it
might
be
better
to
go
to
the
*NL*
Neva
.
There
were
not
so
many
people
there
,
he
would
be
less
observed
,
*NL*
and
it
would
be
more
convenient
in
every
way
,
above
all
it
was
further
*NL*
off
.
He
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
wandering
for
a
good
half-hour
,
*NL*
worried
and
anxious
in
this
dangerous
past
without
thinking
of
it
*NL*
before
.
And
that
half-hour
he
had
lost
over
an
irrational
plan
,
simply
*NL*
because
he
had
thought
of
it
in
delirium
!
He
had
become
extremely
absent
*NL*
and
forgetful
and
he
was
aware
of
it
.
He
certainly
must
make
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
towards
the
Neva
along
V
--
Prospect
,
but
on
the
way
*NL*
another
idea
struck
him
.
``
Why
to
the
Neva
?
Would
it
not
be
better
to
go
*NL*
somewhere
far
off
,
to
the
Islands
again
,
and
there
hide
the
things
*NL*
in
some
solitary
place
,
in
a
wood
or
under
a
bush
,
and
mark
the
spot
*NL*
perhaps
?
''
And
though
he
felt
incapable
of
clear
judgment
,
the
idea
*NL*
seemed
to
him
a
sound
one
.
But
he
was
not
destined
to
go
there
.
For
*NL*
coming
out
of
V
--
Prospect
towards
the
square
,
he
saw
on
the
left
a
*NL*
passage
leading
between
two
blank
walls
to
a
courtyard
.
On
the
right
*NL*
hand
,
the
blank
unwhitewashed
wall
of
a
four-storied
house
stretched
far
*NL*
into
the
court
;
on
the
left
,
a
wooden
hoarding
ran
parallel
with
it
for
*NL*
twenty
paces
into
the
court
,
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
left
.
Here
*NL*
was
a
deserted
fenced-off
place
where
rubbish
of
different
sorts
was
*NL*
lying
.
At
the
end
of
the
court
,
the
corner
of
a
low
,
smutty
,
stone
shed
,
*NL*
apparently
part
of
some
workshop
,
peeped
from
behind
the
hoarding
.
It
*NL*
was
probably
a
carriage
builder
's
or
carpenter
's
shed
;
the
whole
place
*NL*
from
the
entrance
was
black
with
coal
dust
.
Here
would
be
the
place
to
*NL*
throw
it
,
he
thought
.
Not
seeing
anyone
in
the
yard
,
he
slipped
in
,
and
*NL*
at
once
saw
near
the
gate
a
sink
,
such
as
is
often
put
in
yards
where
*NL*
there
are
many
workmen
or
cab-drivers
;
and
on
the
hoarding
above
had
*NL*
been
scribbled
in
chalk
the
time-honoured
witticism
,
``
Standing
here
*NL*
strictly
forbidden
.
''
This
was
all
the
better
,
for
there
would
be
nothing
*NL*
suspicious
about
his
going
in
.
``
Here
I
could
throw
it
all
in
a
heap
and
*NL*
get
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
round
once
more
,
with
his
hand
already
in
his
pocket
,
he
noticed
*NL*
against
the
outer
wall
,
between
the
entrance
and
the
sink
,
a
big
unhewn
*NL*
stone
,
weighing
perhaps
sixty
pounds
.
The
other
side
of
the
wall
was
a
*NL*
street
.
He
could
hear
passers-by
,
always
numerous
in
that
part
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
be
seen
from
the
entrance
,
unless
someone
came
in
from
the
*NL*
street
,
which
might
well
happen
indeed
,
so
there
was
need
of
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
down
over
the
stone
,
seized
the
top
of
it
firmly
in
both
hands
,
*NL*
and
using
all
his
strength
turned
it
over
.
Under
the
stone
was
a
small
*NL*
hollow
in
the
ground
,
and
he
immediately
emptied
his
pocket
into
it
.
*NL*
The
purse
lay
at
the
top
,
and
yet
the
hollow
was
not
filled
up
.
Then
he
*NL*
seized
the
stone
again
and
with
one
twist
turned
it
back
,
so
that
it
was
*NL*
in
the
same
position
again
,
though
it
stood
a
very
little
higher
.
But
*NL*
he
scraped
the
earth
about
it
and
pressed
it
at
the
edges
with
his
foot
.
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
out
,
and
turned
into
the
square
.
Again
an
intense
,
*NL*
almost
unbearable
joy
overwhelmed
him
for
an
instant
,
as
it
had
in
*NL*
the
police-office
.
``
I
have
buried
my
tracks
!
And
who
,
who
can
think
of
*NL*
looking
under
that
stone
?
It
has
been
lying
there
most
likely
ever
since
*NL*
the
house
was
built
,
and
will
lie
as
many
years
more
.
And
if
it
were
*NL*
found
,
who
would
think
of
me
?
It
is
all
over
!
No
clue
!
''
And
he
laughed
.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
remembered
that
he
began
laughing
a
thin
,
nervous
noiseless
*NL*
laugh
,
and
went
on
laughing
all
the
time
he
was
crossing
the
square
.
But
*NL*
when
he
reached
the
K
--
Boulevard
where
two
days
before
he
had
come
*NL*
upon
that
girl
,
his
laughter
suddenly
ceased
.
Other
ideas
crept
into
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
felt
all
at
once
that
it
would
be
loathsome
to
pass
that
seat
*NL*
on
which
after
the
girl
was
gone
,
he
had
sat
and
pondered
,
and
that
it
*NL*
would
be
hateful
,
too
,
to
meet
that
whiskered
policeman
to
whom
he
had
*NL*
given
the
twenty
copecks
:
``
Damn
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
,
looking
about
him
angrily
and
distractedly
.
All
his
ideas
now
*NL*
seemed
to
be
circling
round
some
single
point
,
and
he
felt
that
there
*NL*
really
was
such
a
point
,
and
that
now
,
now
,
he
was
left
facing
that
*NL*
point
--
and
for
the
first
time
,
indeed
,
during
the
last
two
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
!
''
he
thought
suddenly
,
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
fury
.
*NL*
``
If
it
has
begun
,
then
it
has
begun
.
Hang
the
new
life
!
Good
Lord
,
how
*NL*
stupid
it
is
!
...
And
what
lies
I
told
to-day
!
How
despicably
I
fawned
*NL*
upon
that
wretched
Ilya
Petrovitch
!
But
that
is
all
folly
!
What
do
I
*NL*
care
for
them
all
,
and
my
fawning
upon
them
!
It
is
not
that
at
all
!
It
*NL*
is
not
that
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
stopped
;
a
new
utterly
unexpected
and
exceedingly
simple
*NL*
question
perplexed
and
bitterly
confounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
all
has
really
been
done
deliberately
and
not
idiotically
,
if
*NL*
I
really
had
a
certain
and
definite
object
,
how
is
it
I
did
not
even
*NL*
glance
into
the
purse
and
do
n't
know
what
I
had
there
,
for
which
I
have
*NL*
undergone
these
agonies
,
and
have
deliberately
undertaken
this
base
,
*NL*
filthy
degrading
business
?
And
here
I
wanted
at
once
to
throw
into
the
*NL*
water
the
purse
together
with
all
the
things
which
I
had
not
seen
*NL*
either
...
how
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
that
was
so
,
that
was
all
so
.
Yet
he
had
known
it
all
before
,
and
*NL*
it
was
not
a
new
question
for
him
,
even
when
it
was
decided
in
the
night
*NL*
without
hesitation
and
consideration
,
as
though
so
it
must
be
,
as
though
*NL*
it
could
not
possibly
be
otherwise
...
Yes
,
he
had
known
it
all
,
and
*NL*
understood
it
all
;
it
surely
had
all
been
settled
even
yesterday
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
bending
over
the
box
and
pulling
the
jewel-cases
out
*NL*
of
it
...
Yes
,
so
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
because
I
am
very
ill
,
''
he
decided
grimly
at
last
,
``
I
have
been
*NL*
worrying
and
fretting
myself
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
doing
...
*NL*
Yesterday
and
the
day
before
yesterday
and
all
this
time
I
have
been
*NL*
worrying
myself
...
I
shall
get
well
and
I
shall
not
worry
...
But
what
*NL*
if
I
do
n't
get
well
at
all
?
Good
God
,
how
sick
I
am
of
it
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
without
resting
.
He
had
a
terrible
longing
for
some
*NL*
distraction
,
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
what
to
attempt
.
A
new
*NL*
overwhelming
sensation
was
gaining
more
and
more
mastery
over
him
*NL*
every
moment
;
this
was
an
immeasurable
,
almost
physical
,
repulsion
for
*NL*
everything
surrounding
him
,
an
obstinate
,
malignant
feeling
of
hatred
.
*NL*
All
who
met
him
were
loathsome
to
him
--
he
loathed
their
faces
,
their
*NL*
movements
,
their
gestures
.
If
anyone
had
addressed
him
,
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
might
have
spat
at
him
or
bitten
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
suddenly
,
on
coming
out
on
the
bank
of
the
Little
Neva
,
near
*NL*
the
bridge
to
Vassilyevsky
Ostrov
.
``
Why
,
he
lives
here
,
in
that
house
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
,
``
why
,
I
have
not
come
to
Razumihin
of
my
own
accord
!
Here
*NL*
it
's
the
same
thing
over
again
...
Very
interesting
to
know
,
though
;
*NL*
have
I
come
on
purpose
or
have
I
simply
walked
here
by
chance
?
Never
*NL*
mind
,
I
said
the
day
before
yesterday
that
I
would
go
and
see
him
the
*NL*
day
_
after
_
;
well
,
and
so
I
will
!
Besides
I
really
can
not
go
further
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
Razumihin
's
room
on
the
fifth
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
at
home
in
his
garret
,
busily
writing
at
the
moment
,
and
*NL*
he
opened
the
door
himself
.
It
was
four
months
since
they
had
seen
each
*NL*
other
.
Razumihin
was
sitting
in
a
ragged
dressing-gown
,
with
slippers
on
*NL*
his
bare
feet
,
unkempt
,
unshaven
and
unwashed
.
His
face
showed
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
?
''
he
cried
.
He
looked
his
comrade
up
and
down
;
then
after
a
*NL*
brief
pause
,
he
whistled
.
``
As
hard
up
as
all
that
!
Why
,
brother
,
you
've
*NL*
cut
me
out
!
''
he
added
,
looking
at
Raskolnikov
's
rags
.
``
Come
sit
down
,
*NL*
you
are
tired
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
had
sunk
down
on
the
American
leather
sofa
,
which
was
*NL*
in
even
worse
condition
than
his
own
,
Razumihin
saw
at
once
that
his
*NL*
visitor
was
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
are
seriously
ill
,
do
you
know
that
?
''
He
began
feeling
his
*NL*
pulse
.
Raskolnikov
pulled
away
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
have
come
for
this
:
I
have
no
lessons
...
I
*NL*
wanted
,
...
but
I
do
n't
really
want
lessons
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
say
!
You
are
delirious
,
you
know
!
''
Razumihin
observed
,
watching
*NL*
him
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
got
up
from
the
sofa
.
As
he
had
mounted
the
stairs
to
*NL*
Razumihin
's
,
he
had
not
realised
that
he
would
be
meeting
his
friend
*NL*
face
to
face
.
Now
,
in
a
flash
,
he
knew
,
that
what
he
was
least
of
all
*NL*
disposed
for
at
that
moment
was
to
be
face
to
face
with
anyone
in
the
*NL*
wide
world
.
His
spleen
rose
within
him
.
He
almost
choked
with
rage
at
*NL*
himself
as
soon
as
he
crossed
Razumihin
's
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
he
said
abruptly
,
and
walked
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
stop
!
You
queer
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
,
''
said
the
other
,
again
pulling
away
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
the
devil
have
you
come
?
Are
you
mad
,
or
what
?
Why
,
this
*NL*
is
...
almost
insulting
!
I
wo
n't
let
you
go
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
came
to
you
because
I
know
no
one
but
you
who
could
*NL*
help
...
to
begin
...
because
you
are
kinder
than
anyone
--
cleverer
,
I
*NL*
mean
,
and
can
judge
...
and
now
I
see
that
I
want
nothing
.
Do
you
hear
?
*NL*
Nothing
at
all
...
no
one
's
services
...
no
one
's
sympathy
.
I
am
by
*NL*
myself
...
alone
.
Come
,
that
's
enough
.
Leave
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
minute
,
you
sweep
!
You
are
a
perfect
madman
.
As
you
like
for
all
*NL*
I
care
.
I
have
no
lessons
,
do
you
see
,
and
I
do
n't
care
about
that
,
but
*NL*
there
's
a
bookseller
,
Heruvimov
--
and
he
takes
the
place
of
a
lesson
.
*NL*
I
would
not
exchange
him
for
five
lessons
.
He
's
doing
publishing
of
a
*NL*
kind
,
and
issuing
natural
science
manuals
and
what
a
circulation
they
*NL*
have
!
The
very
titles
are
worth
the
money
!
You
always
maintained
that
I
*NL*
was
a
fool
,
but
by
Jove
,
my
boy
,
there
are
greater
fools
than
I
am
!
*NL*
Now
he
is
setting
up
for
being
advanced
,
not
that
he
has
an
inkling
of
*NL*
anything
,
but
,
of
course
,
I
encourage
him
.
Here
are
two
signatures
of
*NL*
the
German
text
--
in
my
opinion
,
the
crudest
charlatanism
;
it
discusses
*NL*
the
question
,
`
Is
woman
a
human
being
?
'
And
,
of
course
,
triumphantly
*NL*
proves
that
she
is
.
Heruvimov
is
going
to
bring
out
this
work
as
a
*NL*
contribution
to
the
woman
question
;
I
am
translating
it
;
he
will
expand
*NL*
these
two
and
a
half
signatures
into
six
,
we
shall
make
up
a
gorgeous
*NL*
title
half
a
page
long
and
bring
it
out
at
half
a
rouble
.
It
will
do
!
He
*NL*
pays
me
six
roubles
the
signature
,
it
works
out
to
about
fifteen
roubles
*NL*
for
the
job
,
and
I
've
had
six
already
in
advance
.
When
we
have
finished
*NL*
this
,
we
are
going
to
begin
a
translation
about
whales
,
and
then
some
of
*NL*
the
dullest
scandals
out
of
the
second
part
of
_
Les
Confessions
_
we
have
*NL*
marked
for
translation
;
somebody
has
told
Heruvimov
,
that
Rousseau
was
*NL*
a
kind
of
Radishchev
.
You
may
be
sure
I
do
n't
contradict
him
,
hang
him
!
*NL*
Well
,
would
you
like
to
do
the
second
signature
of
'
_
Is
woman
a
human
*NL*
being
?
_
'
If
you
would
,
take
the
German
and
pens
and
paper
--
all
those
*NL*
are
provided
,
and
take
three
roubles
;
for
as
I
have
had
six
roubles
in
*NL*
advance
on
the
whole
thing
,
three
roubles
come
to
you
for
your
share
.
*NL*
And
when
you
have
finished
the
signature
there
will
be
another
three
*NL*
roubles
for
you
.
And
please
do
n't
think
I
am
doing
you
a
service
;
quite
*NL*
the
contrary
,
as
soon
as
you
came
in
,
I
saw
how
you
could
help
me
;
to
*NL*
begin
with
,
I
am
weak
in
spelling
,
and
secondly
,
I
am
sometimes
utterly
*NL*
adrift
in
German
,
so
that
I
make
it
up
as
I
go
along
for
the
most
part
.
*NL*
The
only
comfort
is
,
that
it
's
bound
to
be
a
change
for
the
better
.
*NL*
Though
who
can
tell
,
maybe
it
's
sometimes
for
the
worse
.
Will
you
take
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
took
the
German
sheets
in
silence
,
took
the
three
roubles
*NL*
and
without
a
word
went
out
.
Razumihin
gazed
after
him
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
But
when
Raskolnikov
was
in
the
next
street
,
he
turned
back
,
mounted
the
*NL*
stairs
to
Razumihin
's
again
and
laying
on
the
table
the
German
article
*NL*
and
the
three
roubles
,
went
out
again
,
still
without
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
raving
,
or
what
?
''
Razumihin
shouted
,
roused
to
fury
at
last
.
*NL*
``
What
farce
is
this
?
You
'll
drive
me
crazy
too
...
what
did
you
come
to
*NL*
see
me
for
,
damn
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
...
translation
,
''
muttered
Raskolnikov
from
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
the
devil
do
you
want
?
''
shouted
Razumihin
from
above
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
continued
descending
the
staircase
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
there
!
Where
are
you
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
confound
you
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Raskolnikov
was
already
stepping
into
the
street
.
On
the
Nikolaevsky
*NL*
Bridge
he
was
roused
to
full
consciousness
again
by
an
unpleasant
*NL*
incident
.
A
coachman
,
after
shouting
at
him
two
or
three
times
,
gave
him
*NL*
a
violent
lash
on
the
back
with
his
whip
,
for
having
almost
fallen
under
*NL*
his
horses
'
hoofs
.
The
lash
so
infuriated
him
that
he
dashed
away
to
the
*NL*
railing
-LRB-
for
some
unknown
reason
he
had
been
walking
in
the
very
middle
*NL*
of
the
bridge
in
the
traffic
-RRB-
.
He
angrily
clenched
and
ground
his
teeth
.
*NL*
He
heard
laughter
,
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serves
him
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pickpocket
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretending
to
be
drunk
,
for
sure
,
and
getting
under
the
wheels
on
*NL*
purpose
;
and
you
have
to
answer
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
regular
profession
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
he
stood
at
the
railing
,
still
looking
angry
and
bewildered
*NL*
after
the
retreating
carriage
,
and
rubbing
his
back
,
he
suddenly
felt
*NL*
someone
thrust
money
into
his
hand
.
He
looked
.
It
was
an
elderly
woman
*NL*
in
a
kerchief
and
goatskin
shoes
,
with
a
girl
,
probably
her
daughter
,
*NL*
wearing
a
hat
,
and
carrying
a
green
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
my
good
man
,
in
Christ
's
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
and
they
passed
on
.
It
was
a
piece
of
twenty
copecks
.
From
*NL*
his
dress
and
appearance
they
might
well
have
taken
him
for
a
beggar
*NL*
asking
alms
in
the
streets
,
and
the
gift
of
the
twenty
copecks
he
*NL*
doubtless
owed
to
the
blow
,
which
made
them
feel
sorry
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
hand
on
the
twenty
copecks
,
walked
on
for
ten
paces
,
and
*NL*
turned
facing
the
Neva
,
looking
towards
the
palace
.
The
sky
was
without
*NL*
a
cloud
and
the
water
was
almost
bright
blue
,
which
is
so
rare
in
the
*NL*
Neva
.
The
cupola
of
the
cathedral
,
which
is
seen
at
its
best
from
the
*NL*
bridge
about
twenty
paces
from
the
chapel
,
glittered
in
the
sunlight
,
*NL*
and
in
the
pure
air
every
ornament
on
it
could
be
clearly
distinguished
.
*NL*
The
pain
from
the
lash
went
off
,
and
Raskolnikov
forgot
about
it
;
one
*NL*
uneasy
and
not
quite
definite
idea
occupied
him
now
completely
.
He
stood
*NL*
still
,
and
gazed
long
and
intently
into
the
distance
;
this
spot
was
*NL*
especially
familiar
to
him
.
When
he
was
attending
the
university
,
he
had
*NL*
hundreds
of
times
--
generally
on
his
way
home
--
stood
still
on
this
spot
,
*NL*
gazed
at
this
truly
magnificent
spectacle
and
almost
always
marvelled
at
*NL*
a
vague
and
mysterious
emotion
it
roused
in
him
.
It
left
him
strangely
*NL*
cold
;
this
gorgeous
picture
was
for
him
blank
and
lifeless
.
He
wondered
*NL*
every
time
at
his
sombre
and
enigmatic
impression
and
,
mistrusting
*NL*
himself
,
put
off
finding
the
explanation
of
it
.
He
vividly
recalled
*NL*
those
old
doubts
and
perplexities
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
*NL*
no
mere
chance
that
he
recalled
them
now
.
It
struck
him
as
strange
and
*NL*
grotesque
,
that
he
should
have
stopped
at
the
same
spot
as
before
,
*NL*
as
though
he
actually
imagined
he
could
think
the
same
thoughts
,
be
*NL*
interested
in
the
same
theories
and
pictures
that
had
interested
him
...
*NL*
so
short
a
time
ago
.
He
felt
it
almost
amusing
,
and
yet
it
wrung
his
*NL*
heart
.
Deep
down
,
hidden
far
away
out
of
sight
all
that
seemed
to
him
*NL*
now
--
all
his
old
past
,
his
old
thoughts
,
his
old
problems
and
theories
,
*NL*
his
old
impressions
and
that
picture
and
himself
and
all
,
all
...
He
*NL*
felt
as
though
he
were
flying
upwards
,
and
everything
were
vanishing
*NL*
from
his
sight
.
Making
an
unconscious
movement
with
his
hand
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
piece
of
money
in
his
fist
.
He
opened
his
*NL*
hand
,
stared
at
the
coin
,
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
flung
it
into
*NL*
the
water
;
then
he
turned
and
went
home
.
It
seemed
to
him
,
he
had
cut
*NL*
himself
off
from
everyone
and
from
everything
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
was
coming
on
when
he
reached
home
,
so
that
he
must
have
been
*NL*
walking
about
six
hours
.
How
and
where
he
came
back
he
did
not
remember
.
*NL*
Undressing
,
and
quivering
like
an
overdriven
horse
,
he
lay
down
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
drew
his
greatcoat
over
him
,
and
at
once
sank
into
oblivion
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dusk
when
he
was
waked
up
by
a
fearful
scream
.
Good
God
,
what
a
*NL*
scream
!
Such
unnatural
sounds
,
such
howling
,
wailing
,
grinding
,
tears
,
*NL*
blows
and
curses
he
had
never
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
never
have
imagined
such
brutality
,
such
frenzy
.
In
terror
he
*NL*
sat
up
in
bed
,
almost
swooning
with
agony
.
But
the
fighting
,
wailing
*NL*
and
cursing
grew
louder
and
louder
.
And
then
to
his
intense
amazement
*NL*
he
caught
the
voice
of
his
landlady
.
She
was
howling
,
shrieking
and
*NL*
wailing
,
rapidly
,
hurriedly
,
incoherently
,
so
that
he
could
not
make
*NL*
out
what
she
was
talking
about
;
she
was
beseeching
,
no
doubt
,
not
to
be
*NL*
beaten
,
for
she
was
being
mercilessly
beaten
on
the
stairs
.
The
voice
of
*NL*
her
assailant
was
so
horrible
from
spite
and
rage
that
it
was
almost
*NL*
a
croak
;
but
he
,
too
,
was
saying
something
,
and
just
as
quickly
*NL*
and
indistinctly
,
hurrying
and
spluttering
.
All
at
once
Raskolnikov
*NL*
trembled
;
he
recognised
the
voice
--
it
was
the
voice
of
Ilya
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
Ilya
Petrovitch
here
and
beating
the
landlady
!
He
is
kicking
her
,
*NL*
banging
her
head
against
the
steps
--
that
's
clear
,
that
can
be
told
*NL*
from
the
sounds
,
from
the
cries
and
the
thuds
.
How
is
it
,
is
the
world
*NL*
topsy-turvy
?
He
could
hear
people
running
in
crowds
from
all
the
storeys
*NL*
and
all
the
staircases
;
he
heard
voices
,
exclamations
,
knocking
,
doors
*NL*
banging
.
``
But
why
,
why
,
and
how
could
it
be
?
''
he
repeated
,
thinking
*NL*
seriously
that
he
had
gone
mad
.
But
no
,
he
heard
too
distinctly
!
And
*NL*
they
would
come
to
him
then
next
,
``
for
no
doubt
...
it
's
all
about
*NL*
that
...
about
yesterday
...
Good
God
!
''
He
would
have
fastened
his
door
*NL*
with
the
latch
,
but
he
could
not
lift
his
hand
...
besides
,
it
would
*NL*
be
useless
.
Terror
gripped
his
heart
like
ice
,
tortured
him
and
numbed
*NL*
him
...
But
at
last
all
this
uproar
,
after
continuing
about
ten
minutes
,
*NL*
began
gradually
to
subside
.
The
landlady
was
moaning
and
groaning
;
Ilya
*NL*
Petrovitch
was
still
uttering
threats
and
curses
...
But
at
last
he
,
*NL*
too
,
seemed
to
be
silent
,
and
now
he
could
not
be
heard
.
``
Can
he
have
*NL*
gone
away
?
Good
Lord
!
''
Yes
,
and
now
the
landlady
is
going
too
,
still
*NL*
weeping
and
moaning
...
and
then
her
door
slammed
...
Now
the
crowd
was
*NL*
going
from
the
stairs
to
their
rooms
,
exclaiming
,
disputing
,
calling
*NL*
to
one
another
,
raising
their
voices
to
a
shout
,
dropping
them
to
a
*NL*
whisper
.
There
must
have
been
numbers
of
them
--
almost
all
the
inmates
*NL*
of
the
block
.
``
But
,
good
God
,
how
could
it
be
!
And
why
,
why
had
he
come
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
sank
worn
out
on
the
sofa
,
but
could
not
close
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
lay
for
half
an
hour
in
such
anguish
,
such
an
intolerable
sensation
of
*NL*
infinite
terror
as
he
had
never
experienced
before
.
Suddenly
a
bright
*NL*
light
flashed
into
his
room
.
Nastasya
came
in
with
a
candle
and
a
plate
*NL*
of
soup
.
Looking
at
him
carefully
and
ascertaining
that
he
was
not
*NL*
asleep
,
she
set
the
candle
on
the
table
and
began
to
lay
out
what
she
*NL*
had
brought
--
bread
,
salt
,
a
plate
,
a
spoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
eaten
nothing
since
yesterday
,
I
warrant
.
You
've
been
trudging
*NL*
about
all
day
,
and
you
're
shaking
with
fever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasya
...
what
were
they
beating
the
landlady
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
intently
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
beat
the
landlady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
...
half
an
hour
ago
,
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
the
assistant
*NL*
superintendent
,
on
the
stairs
...
Why
was
he
ill-treating
her
like
that
,
*NL*
and
...
why
was
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasya
scrutinised
him
,
silent
and
frowning
,
and
her
scrutiny
lasted
a
*NL*
long
time
.
He
felt
uneasy
,
even
frightened
at
her
searching
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasya
,
why
do
n't
you
speak
?
''
he
said
timidly
at
last
in
a
weak
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
blood
,
''
she
answered
at
last
softly
,
as
though
speaking
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blood
?
What
blood
?
''
he
muttered
,
growing
white
and
turning
towards
the
*NL*
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasya
still
looked
at
him
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
has
been
beating
the
landlady
,
''
she
declared
at
last
in
a
firm
,
*NL*
resolute
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
at
her
,
hardly
able
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
it
myself
...
I
was
not
asleep
...
I
was
sitting
up
,
''
he
*NL*
said
still
more
timidly
.
``
I
listened
a
long
while
.
The
assistant
*NL*
superintendent
came
...
Everyone
ran
out
on
to
the
stairs
from
all
the
*NL*
flats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
has
been
here
.
That
's
the
blood
crying
in
your
ears
.
When
*NL*
there
's
no
outlet
for
it
and
it
gets
clotted
,
you
begin
fancying
*NL*
things
...
Will
you
eat
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
answer
.
Nastasya
still
stood
over
him
,
watching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
something
to
drink
...
Nastasya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
downstairs
and
returned
with
a
white
earthenware
jug
of
water
.
*NL*
He
remembered
only
swallowing
one
sip
of
the
cold
water
and
spilling
*NL*
some
on
his
neck
.
Then
followed
forgetfulness
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
completely
unconscious
,
however
,
all
the
time
he
was
ill
;
he
*NL*
was
in
a
feverish
state
,
sometimes
delirious
,
sometimes
half
conscious
.
*NL*
He
remembered
a
great
deal
afterwards
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
as
though
*NL*
there
were
a
number
of
people
round
him
;
they
wanted
to
take
him
away
*NL*
somewhere
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
squabbling
and
discussing
about
*NL*
him
.
Then
he
would
be
alone
in
the
room
;
they
had
all
gone
away
afraid
*NL*
of
him
,
and
only
now
and
then
opened
the
door
a
crack
to
look
at
him
;
*NL*
they
threatened
him
,
plotted
something
together
,
laughed
,
and
mocked
*NL*
at
him
.
He
remembered
Nastasya
often
at
his
bedside
;
he
distinguished
*NL*
another
person
,
too
,
whom
he
seemed
to
know
very
well
,
though
he
could
*NL*
not
remember
who
he
was
,
and
this
fretted
him
,
even
made
him
cry
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
fancied
he
had
been
lying
there
a
month
;
at
other
times
*NL*
it
all
seemed
part
of
the
same
day
.
But
of
_
that
_
--
of
_
that
_
he
had
*NL*
no
recollection
,
and
yet
every
minute
he
felt
that
he
had
forgotten
*NL*
something
he
ought
to
remember
.
He
worried
and
tormented
himself
trying
*NL*
to
remember
,
moaned
,
flew
into
a
rage
,
or
sank
into
awful
,
intolerable
*NL*
terror
.
Then
he
struggled
to
get
up
,
would
have
run
away
,
but
someone
*NL*
always
prevented
him
by
force
,
and
he
sank
back
into
impotence
and
*NL*
forgetfulness
.
At
last
he
returned
to
complete
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
On
fine
days
the
sun
shone
*NL*
into
the
room
at
that
hour
,
throwing
a
streak
of
light
on
the
right
*NL*
wall
and
the
corner
near
the
door
.
Nastasya
was
standing
beside
him
*NL*
with
another
person
,
a
complete
stranger
,
who
was
looking
at
him
*NL*
very
inquisitively
.
He
was
a
young
man
with
a
beard
,
wearing
a
full
,
*NL*
short-waisted
coat
,
and
looked
like
a
messenger
.
The
landlady
was
*NL*
peeping
in
at
the
half-opened
door
.
Raskolnikov
sat
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
,
Nastasya
?
''
he
asked
,
pointing
to
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
he
's
himself
again
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
himself
,
''
echoed
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Concluding
that
he
had
returned
to
his
senses
,
the
landlady
closed
the
*NL*
door
and
disappeared
.
She
was
always
shy
and
dreaded
conversations
or
*NL*
discussions
.
She
was
a
woman
of
forty
,
not
at
all
bad-looking
,
fat
*NL*
and
buxom
,
with
black
eyes
and
eyebrows
,
good-natured
from
fatness
and
*NL*
laziness
,
and
absurdly
bashful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
...
are
you
?
''
he
went
on
,
addressing
the
man
.
But
at
that
moment
*NL*
the
door
was
flung
open
,
and
,
stooping
a
little
,
as
he
was
so
tall
,
*NL*
Razumihin
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
cabin
it
is
!
''
he
cried
.
``
I
am
always
knocking
my
head
.
You
call
*NL*
this
a
lodging
!
So
you
are
conscious
,
brother
?
I
've
just
heard
the
news
*NL*
from
Pashenka
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
just
come
to
,
''
said
Nastasya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
come
to
,
''
echoed
the
man
again
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
are
you
?
''
Razumihin
asked
,
suddenly
addressing
him
.
``
My
name
is
*NL*
Vrazumihin
,
at
your
service
;
not
Razumihin
,
as
I
am
always
called
,
but
*NL*
Vrazumihin
,
a
student
and
gentleman
;
and
he
is
my
friend
.
And
who
are
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
messenger
from
our
office
,
from
the
merchant
Shelopaev
,
and
*NL*
I
've
come
on
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
sit
down
.
''
Razumihin
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
table
.
``
It
's
a
good
thing
you
've
come
to
,
brother
,
''
he
went
on
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
``
For
the
last
four
days
you
have
scarcely
eaten
or
drunk
*NL*
anything
.
We
had
to
give
you
tea
in
spoonfuls
.
I
brought
Zossimov
to
see
*NL*
you
twice
.
You
remember
Zossimov
?
He
examined
you
carefully
and
said
at
*NL*
once
it
was
nothing
serious
--
something
seemed
to
have
gone
to
your
head
.
*NL*
Some
nervous
nonsense
,
the
result
of
bad
feeding
,
he
says
you
have
not
*NL*
had
enough
beer
and
radish
,
but
it
's
nothing
much
,
it
will
pass
and
you
*NL*
will
be
all
right
.
Zossimov
is
a
first-rate
fellow
!
He
is
making
quite
a
*NL*
name
.
Come
,
I
wo
n't
keep
you
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
the
man
again
.
``
Will
*NL*
you
explain
what
you
want
?
You
must
know
,
Rodya
,
this
is
the
second
time

they
have
sent
from
the
office
;
but
it
was
another
man
last
time
,
and
I
*NL*
talked
to
him
.
Who
was
it
came
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
the
day
before
yesterday
,
I
venture
to
say
,
if
you
please

*NL*
sir

That
was
Alexey
Semyonovitch
;
he
is
in
our
office
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
more
intelligent
than
you
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
sir
,
he
is
of
more
weight
than
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
;
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
mamma
's
request

through
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
Vahrushin

of
whom
*NL*
I
presume
you
have
heard
more
than
once
,
a
remittance
is
sent
to
you
*NL*
from
our
office
,
''
the
man
began
,
addressing
Raskolnikov
.
``
If
you
are
in
*NL*
an
intelligible
condition
,
I
've
thirty-five
roubles
to
remit
to
you

*NL*
Semyon
Semyonovitch
has
received
from
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
at
your
mamma
's
*NL*
request
instructions
to
that
effect
,
as
on
previous
occasions
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
him
,
sir
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
remember

Vahrushin

Raskolnikov
said
dreamily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear

he
knows
Vahrushin

cried
Razumihin
.
``
He
is
in

an
*NL*
intelligible
condition

!
And
I
see
you
are
an
intelligent
man
too

Well
,
*NL*
it
's
always
pleasant
to
hear
words
of
wisdom

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
gentleman

Vahrushin

Afanasy
Ivanovitch

And
at
the
request

of
your
mamma

who
has
sent
you
a
remittance
once
before
in
the
*NL*
same
manner
through
him
,
he
did
not
refuse
this
time
also
,
and
sent
*NL*
instructions
to
Semyon
Semyonovitch
some
days
since
to
hand
you
*NL*
thirty-five
roubles
in
the
hope
of
better
to
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

is
the
best
thing
you

your
mamma

is
not
bad
either

Come
then
,
what
do
you
say
?
Is
he
fully
*NL*
conscious
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right

If

he
can
sign
this
little
paper

scrawl
his

scribble

for

For
just
now

money
is
sweeter
*NL*
to
us
than
treacle

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want

said
Raskolnikov
,
pushing
away
the
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
the
devil
can
you
do
without
signing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

the
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

that
's
nonsense

I
bear
witness

Do
n't
trouble
,
please

it
's
only
that
he
is
on
his
travels
again
.
But
*NL*
that
's
pretty
common
with
him
at
all
times
though
...
You
are
a
man
of
*NL*
judgment
and
we
will
take
him
in
hand
,
that
is
,
more
simply
,
take
his
*NL*
hand
and
he
will
sign
it

Here

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
come
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

Why
should
we
trouble
you
?
You
are
a
man
of
judgment
...
Now
,
*NL*
Rodya
,
do
n't
keep
your
visitor
,
you
see
he
is
waiting
,
''
and
he
made
*NL*
ready
to
hold
Raskolnikov
's
hand
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
I
'll
do
it
alone
,
''
said
the
latter
,
taking
the
pen
and
signing
*NL*
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
messenger
took
out
the
money
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
And
now
,
brother
,
are
you
hungry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
soup
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
yesterday
's
,
''
answered
Nastasya
,
who
was
still
standing
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
potatoes
and
rice
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
by
heart
.
Bring
soup
and
give
us
some
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
at
all
this
with
profound
astonishment
and
a
dull
,
*NL*
unreasoning
terror
.
He
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
quiet
and
see
what
*NL*
would
happen
.
``
I
believe
I
am
not
wandering
.
I
believe
it
's
reality
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
couple
of
minutes
Nastasya
returned
with
the
soup
,
and
announced
*NL*
that
the
tea
would
be
ready
directly
.
With
the
soup
she
brought
two
*NL*
spoons
,
two
plates
,
salt
,
pepper
,
mustard
for
the
beef
,
and
so
on
.
The
*NL*
table
was
set
as
it
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
.
The
cloth
was
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
not
be
amiss
,
Nastasya
,
if
Praskovya
Pavlovna
were
to
send
us
*NL*
up
a
couple
of
bottles
of
beer
.
We
could
empty
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
a
cool
hand
,
''
muttered
Nastasya
,
and
she
departed
to
*NL*
carry
out
his
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
still
gazed
wildly
with
strained
attention
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
Razumihin
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
him
,
as
clumsily
as
a
bear
put
his
*NL*
left
arm
round
Raskolnikov
's
head
,
although
he
was
able
to
sit
up
,
and
*NL*
with
his
right
hand
gave
him
a
spoonful
of
soup
,
blowing
on
it
that
*NL*
it
might
not
burn
him
.
But
the
soup
was
only
just
warm
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
swallowed
one
spoonful
greedily
,
then
a
second
,
then
a
third
.
But
after
*NL*
giving
him
a
few
more
spoonfuls
of
soup
,
Razumihin
suddenly
stopped
,
and
*NL*
said
that
he
must
ask
Zossimov
whether
he
ought
to
have
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasya
came
in
with
two
bottles
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
have
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
along
,
Nastasya
,
and
bring
some
tea
,
for
tea
we
may
venture
on
*NL*
without
the
faculty
.
But
here
is
the
beer
!
''
He
moved
back
to
his
chair
,
*NL*
pulled
the
soup
and
meat
in
front
of
him
,
and
began
eating
as
though
he
*NL*
had
not
touched
food
for
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
,
Rodya
,
I
dine
like
this
here
every
day
now
,
''
he
*NL*
mumbled
with
his
mouth
full
of
beef
,
``
and
it
's
all
Pashenka
,
your
dear
*NL*
little
landlady
,
who
sees
to
that
;
she
loves
to
do
anything
for
me
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
ask
for
it
,
but
,
of
course
,
I
do
n't
object
.
And
here
's
Nastasya
*NL*
with
the
tea
.
She
is
a
quick
girl
.
Nastasya
,
my
dear
,
wo
n't
you
have
*NL*
some
beer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
along
with
your
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cup
of
tea
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cup
of
tea
,
maybe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pour
it
out
.
Stay
,
I
'll
pour
it
out
myself
.
Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
poured
out
two
cups
,
left
his
dinner
,
and
sat
on
the
sofa
again
.
As
*NL*
before
,
he
put
his
left
arm
round
the
sick
man
's
head
,
raised
him
up
*NL*
and
gave
him
tea
in
spoonfuls
,
again
blowing
each
spoonful
steadily
and
*NL*
earnestly
,
as
though
this
process
was
the
principal
and
most
effective
*NL*
means
towards
his
friend
's
recovery
.
Raskolnikov
said
nothing
and
made
*NL*
no
resistance
,
though
he
felt
quite
strong
enough
to
sit
up
on
the
sofa
*NL*
without
support
and
could
not
merely
have
held
a
cup
or
a
spoon
,
but
*NL*
even
perhaps
could
have
walked
about
.
But
from
some
queer
,
almost
*NL*
animal
,
cunning
he
conceived
the
idea
of
hiding
his
strength
and
lying
*NL*
low
for
a
time
,
pretending
if
necessary
not
to
be
yet
in
full
possession
*NL*
of
his
faculties
,
and
meanwhile
listening
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
.
*NL*
Yet
he
could
not
overcome
his
sense
of
repugnance
.
After
sipping
a
dozen
*NL*
spoonfuls
of
tea
,
he
suddenly
released
his
head
,
pushed
the
spoon
away
*NL*
capriciously
,
and
sank
back
on
the
pillow
.
There
were
actually
real
*NL*
pillows
under
his
head
now
,
down
pillows
in
clean
cases
,
he
observed
*NL*
that
,
too
,
and
took
note
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pashenka
must
give
us
some
raspberry
jam
to-day
to
make
him
some
*NL*
raspberry
tea
,
''
said
Razumihin
,
going
back
to
his
chair
and
attacking
*NL*
his
soup
and
beer
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
she
to
get
raspberries
for
you
?
''
asked
Nastasya
,
balancing
*NL*
a
saucer
on
her
five
outspread
fingers
and
sipping
tea
through
a
lump
of
*NL*
sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
get
it
at
the
shop
,
my
dear
.
You
see
,
Rodya
,
all
sorts
of
things
*NL*
have
been
happening
while
you
have
been
laid
up
.
When
you
decamped
in
*NL*
that
rascally
way
without
leaving
your
address
,
I
felt
so
angry
that
I
*NL*
resolved
to
find
you
out
and
punish
you
.
I
set
to
work
that
very
day
.
*NL*
How
I
ran
about
making
inquiries
for
you
!
This
lodging
of
yours
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
,
though
I
never
remembered
it
,
indeed
,
because
I
did
not
know
*NL*
it
;
and
as
for
your
old
lodgings
,
I
could
only
remember
it
was
at
the
*NL*
Five
Corners
,
Harlamov
's
house
.
I
kept
trying
to
find
that
Harlamov
's
*NL*
house
,
and
afterwards
it
turned
out
that
it
was
not
Harlamov
's
,
but
*NL*
Buch
's
.
How
one
muddles
up
sound
sometimes
!
So
I
lost
my
temper
,
and
I
*NL*
went
on
the
chance
to
the
address
bureau
next
day
,
and
only
fancy
,
in
*NL*
two
minutes
they
looked
you
up
!
Your
name
is
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
;
and
yet
a
General
Kobelev
they
could
not
find
while
*NL*
I
was
there
.
Well
,
it
's
a
long
story
.
But
as
soon
as
I
did
land
on
this
*NL*
place
,
I
soon
got
to
know
all
your
affairs
--
all
,
all
,
brother
,
I
know
*NL*
everything
;
Nastasya
here
will
tell
you
.
I
made
the
acquaintance
of
*NL*
Nikodim
Fomitch
and
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
and
the
house-porter
and
Mr.
*NL*
Zametov
,
Alexandr
Grigorievitch
,
the
head
clerk
in
the
police
office
,
*NL*
and
,
last
,
but
not
least
,
of
Pashenka
;
Nastasya
here
knows
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
round
her
,
''
Nastasya
murmured
,
smiling
slyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
put
the
sugar
in
your
tea
,
Nastasya
Nikiforovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
one
!
''
Nastasya
cried
suddenly
,
going
off
into
a
giggle
.
``
I
am
*NL*
not
Nikiforovna
,
but
Petrovna
,
''
she
added
suddenly
,
recovering
from
her
*NL*
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
make
a
note
of
it
.
Well
,
brother
,
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
*NL*
I
was
going
in
for
a
regular
explosion
here
to
uproot
all
malignant
*NL*
influences
in
the
locality
,
but
Pashenka
won
the
day
.
I
had
not
*NL*
expected
,
brother
,
to
find
her
so
...
prepossessing
.
Eh
,
what
do
you
*NL*
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
did
not
speak
,
but
he
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
,
*NL*
full
of
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
that
could
be
wished
,
indeed
,
in
every
respect
,
''
Razumihin
went
*NL*
on
,
not
at
all
embarrassed
by
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
sly
dog
!
''
Nastasya
shrieked
again
.
This
conversation
afforded
*NL*
her
unspeakable
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
,
brother
,
that
you
did
not
set
to
work
in
the
right
way
*NL*
at
first
.
You
ought
to
have
approached
her
differently
.
She
is
,
so
*NL*
to
speak
,
a
most
unaccountable
character
.
But
we
will
talk
about
her
*NL*
character
later
...
How
could
you
let
things
come
to
such
a
pass
that
*NL*
she
gave
up
sending
you
your
dinner
?
And
that
I
O
U
?
You
must
have
been
*NL*
mad
to
sign
an
I
O
U.
And
that
promise
of
marriage
when
her
daughter
,
*NL*
Natalya
Yegorovna
,
was
alive
?
...
I
know
all
about
it
!
But
I
see
that
's
*NL*
a
delicate
matter
and
I
am
an
ass
;
forgive
me
.
But
,
talking
of
*NL*
foolishness
,
do
you
know
Praskovya
Pavlovna
is
not
nearly
so
foolish
as
*NL*
you
would
think
at
first
sight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
mumbled
Raskolnikov
,
looking
away
,
but
feeling
that
it
was
better
*NL*
to
keep
up
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
n't
,
is
she
?
''
cried
Razumihin
,
delighted
to
get
an
answer
out
*NL*
of
him
.
``
But
she
is
not
very
clever
either
,
eh
?
She
is
essentially
,
*NL*
essentially
an
unaccountable
character
!
I
am
sometimes
quite
at
a
loss
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
...
She
must
be
forty
;
she
says
she
is
thirty-six
,
and
*NL*
of
course
she
has
every
right
to
say
so
.
But
I
swear
I
judge
her
*NL*
intellectually
,
simply
from
the
metaphysical
point
of
view
;
there
is
a
*NL*
sort
of
symbolism
sprung
up
between
us
,
a
sort
of
algebra
or
what
not
!
*NL*
I
do
n't
understand
it
!
Well
,
that
's
all
nonsense
.
Only
,
seeing
that
you
*NL*
are
not
a
student
now
and
have
lost
your
lessons
and
your
clothes
,
and
*NL*
that
through
the
young
lady
's
death
she
has
no
need
to
treat
you
as
*NL*
a
relation
,
she
suddenly
took
fright
;
and
as
you
hid
in
your
den
and
*NL*
dropped
all
your
old
relations
with
her
,
she
planned
to
get
rid
of
you
.
*NL*
And
she
's
been
cherishing
that
design
a
long
time
,
but
was
sorry
to
lose
*NL*
the
I
O
U
,
for
you
assured
her
yourself
that
your
mother
would
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
base
of
me
to
say
that
...
My
mother
herself
is
almost
*NL*
a
beggar
...
and
I
told
a
lie
to
keep
my
lodging
...
and
be
fed
,
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
said
loudly
and
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
did
very
sensibly
.
But
the
worst
of
it
is
that
at
that
point
*NL*
Mr.
Tchebarov
turns
up
,
a
business
man
.
Pashenka
would
never
have
*NL*
thought
of
doing
anything
on
her
own
account
,
she
is
too
retiring
;
but
*NL*
the
business
man
is
by
no
means
retiring
,
and
first
thing
he
puts
the
*NL*
question
,
`
Is
there
any
hope
of
realising
the
I
O
U
?
'
Answer
:
there
is
,
*NL*
because
he
has
a
mother
who
would
save
her
Rodya
with
her
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty-five
roubles
pension
,
if
she
has
to
starve
herself
;
and
a
sister
,
*NL*
too
,
who
would
go
into
bondage
for
his
sake
.
That
's
what
he
was
building
*NL*
upon
...
Why
do
you
start
?
I
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
your
affairs
*NL*
now
,
my
dear
boy
--
it
's
not
for
nothing
that
you
were
so
open
with
*NL*
Pashenka
when
you
were
her
prospective
son-in-law
,
and
I
say
all
this
as
*NL*
a
friend
...
But
I
tell
you
what
it
is
;
an
honest
and
sensitive
man
is
*NL*
open
;
and
a
business
man
`
listens
and
goes
on
eating
'
you
up
.
Well
,
*NL*
then
she
gave
the
I
O
U
by
way
of
payment
to
this
Tchebarov
,
and
without
*NL*
hesitation
he
made
a
formal
demand
for
payment
.
When
I
heard
of
all
this
*NL*
I
wanted
to
blow
him
up
,
too
,
to
clear
my
conscience
,
but
by
that
time
*NL*
harmony
reigned
between
me
and
Pashenka
,
and
I
insisted
on
stopping
*NL*
the
whole
affair
,
engaging
that
you
would
pay
.
I
went
security
for
you
,
*NL*
brother
.
Do
you
understand
?
We
called
Tchebarov
,
flung
him
ten
*NL*
roubles
and
got
the
I
O
U
back
from
him
,
and
here
I
have
the
honour
of
*NL*
presenting
it
to
you
.
She
trusts
your
word
now
.
Here
,
take
it
,
you
see
I
*NL*
have
torn
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
put
the
note
on
the
table
.
Raskolnikov
looked
at
him
and
*NL*
turned
to
the
wall
without
uttering
a
word
.
Even
Razumihin
felt
a
*NL*
twinge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
brother
,
''
he
said
a
moment
later
,
``
that
I
have
been
playing
the
*NL*
fool
again
.
I
thought
I
should
amuse
you
with
my
chatter
,
and
I
believe
*NL*
I
have
only
made
you
cross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
you
I
did
not
recognise
when
I
was
delirious
?
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
asked
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
without
turning
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
you
flew
into
a
rage
about
it
,
especially
when
I
brought
*NL*
Zametov
one
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zametov
?
The
head
clerk
?
What
for
?
''
Raskolnikov
turned
round
quickly
*NL*
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
...
What
are
you
upset
about
?
He
wanted
to
*NL*
make
your
acquaintance
because
I
talked
to
him
a
lot
about
you
...
How
*NL*
could
I
have
found
out
so
much
except
from
him
?
He
is
a
capital
*NL*
fellow
,
brother
,
first-rate
...
in
his
own
way
,
of
course
.
Now
we
are
*NL*
friends
--
see
each
other
almost
every
day
.
I
have
moved
into
this
part
,
*NL*
you
know
.
I
have
only
just
moved
.
I
've
been
with
him
to
Luise
Ivanovna
*NL*
once
or
twice
...
Do
you
remember
Luise
,
Luise
Ivanovna
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
say
anything
in
delirium
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
!
You
were
beside
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
rave
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
What
did
you
rave
about
?
What
people
do
rave
about
...
Well
,
*NL*
brother
,
now
I
must
not
lose
time
.
To
work
.
''
He
got
up
from
the
table
*NL*
and
took
up
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
rave
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
he
keeps
on
!
Are
you
afraid
of
having
let
out
some
secret
?
Do
n't
*NL*
worry
yourself
;
you
said
nothing
about
a
countess
.
But
you
said
a
lot
*NL*
about
a
bulldog
,
and
about
ear-rings
and
chains
,
and
about
Krestovsky
*NL*
Island
,
and
some
porter
,
and
Nikodim
Fomitch
and
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
the
*NL*
assistant
superintendent
.
And
another
thing
that
was
of
special
interest
*NL*
to
you
was
your
own
sock
.
You
whined
,
`
Give
me
my
sock
.
'
Zametov
*NL*
hunted
all
about
your
room
for
your
socks
,
and
with
his
own
scented
,
*NL*
ring-bedecked
fingers
he
gave
you
the
rag
.
And
only
then
were
you
*NL*
comforted
,
and
for
the
next
twenty-four
hours
you
held
the
wretched
*NL*
thing
in
your
hand
;
we
could
not
get
it
from
you
.
It
is
most
likely
*NL*
somewhere
under
your
quilt
at
this
moment
.
And
then
you
asked
so
*NL*
piteously
for
fringe
for
your
trousers
.
We
tried
to
find
out
what
sort
*NL*
of
fringe
,
but
we
could
not
make
it
out
.
Now
to
business
!
Here
are
*NL*
thirty-five
roubles
;
I
take
ten
of
them
,
and
shall
give
you
an
account
*NL*
of
them
in
an
hour
or
two
.
I
will
let
Zossimov
know
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
though
he
ought
to
have
been
here
long
ago
,
for
it
is
nearly
twelve
.
And
*NL*
you
,
Nastasya
,
look
in
pretty
often
while
I
am
away
,
to
see
whether
he
*NL*
wants
a
drink
or
anything
else
.
And
I
will
tell
Pashenka
what
is
wanted
*NL*
myself
.
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
calls
her
Pashenka
!
Ah
,
he
's
a
deep
one
!
''
said
Nastasya
as
he
went
*NL*
out
;
then
she
opened
the
door
and
stood
listening
,
but
could
not
resist
*NL*
running
downstairs
after
him
.
She
was
very
eager
to
hear
what
he
would
*NL*
say
to
the
landlady
.
She
was
evidently
quite
fascinated
by
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
she
left
the
room
than
the
sick
man
flung
off
the
*NL*
bedclothes
and
leapt
out
of
bed
like
a
madman
.
With
burning
,
twitching
*NL*
impatience
he
had
waited
for
them
to
be
gone
so
that
he
might
set
to
*NL*
work
.
But
to
what
work
?
Now
,
as
though
to
spite
him
,
it
eluded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
only
tell
me
one
thing
:
do
they
know
of
it
yet
or
not
?
What
*NL*
if
they
know
it
and
are
only
pretending
,
mocking
me
while
I
am
laid
up
,
*NL*
and
then
they
will
come
in
and
tell
me
that
it
's
been
discovered
long
*NL*
ago
and
that
they
have
only
...
What
am
I
to
do
now
?
That
's
what
I
've
*NL*
forgotten
,
as
though
on
purpose
;
forgotten
it
all
at
once
,
I
remembered
*NL*
a
minute
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
gazed
in
miserable
bewilderment
*NL*
about
him
;
he
walked
to
the
door
,
opened
it
,
listened
;
but
that
was
not
*NL*
what
he
wanted
.
Suddenly
,
as
though
recalling
something
,
he
rushed
to
*NL*
the
corner
where
there
was
a
hole
under
the
paper
,
began
examining
it
,
*NL*
put
his
hand
into
the
hole
,
fumbled
--
but
that
was
not
it
.
He
went
to
the
*NL*
stove
,
opened
it
and
began
rummaging
in
the
ashes
;
the
frayed
edges
of
*NL*
his
trousers
and
the
rags
cut
off
his
pocket
were
lying
there
just
as
*NL*
he
had
thrown
them
.
No
one
had
looked
,
then
!
Then
he
remembered
the
sock
*NL*
about
which
Razumihin
had
just
been
telling
him
.
Yes
,
there
it
lay
on
*NL*
the
sofa
under
the
quilt
,
but
it
was
so
covered
with
dust
and
grime
that
*NL*
Zametov
could
not
have
seen
anything
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
Zametov
!
The
police
office
!
And
why
am
I
sent
for
to
the
police
*NL*
office
?
Where
's
the
notice
?
Bah
!
I
am
mixing
it
up
;
that
was
then
.
I
*NL*
looked
at
my
sock
then
,
too
,
but
now
...
now
I
have
been
ill
.
But
*NL*
what
did
Zametov
come
for
?
Why
did
Razumihin
bring
him
?
''
he
muttered
,
*NL*
helplessly
sitting
on
the
sofa
again
.
``
What
does
it
mean
?
Am
I
still
in
*NL*
delirium
,
or
is
it
real
?
I
believe
it
is
real
...
Ah
,
I
remember
;
I
must
*NL*
escape
!
Make
haste
to
escape
.
Yes
,
I
must
,
I
must
escape
!
Yes
...
but
*NL*
where
?
And
where
are
my
clothes
?
I
've
no
boots
.
They
've
taken
them
away
!
*NL*
They
've
hidden
them
!
I
understand
!
Ah
,
here
is
my
coat
--
they
passed
that
*NL*
over
!
And
here
is
money
on
the
table
,
thank
God
!
And
here
's
the
I
O
U.
.
.
*NL*
I
'll
take
the
money
and
go
and
take
another
lodging
.
They
wo
n't
find
*NL*
me
!
...
Yes
,
but
the
address
bureau
?
They
'll
find
me
,
Razumihin
will
find
*NL*
me
.
Better
escape
altogether
...
far
away
...
to
America
,
and
let
them
*NL*
do
their
worst
!
And
take
the
I
O
U.
.
.
it
would
be
of
use
there
...
What
*NL*
else
shall
I
take
?
They
think
I
am
ill
!
They
do
n't
know
that
I
can
walk
,
*NL*
ha-ha-ha
!
I
could
see
by
their
eyes
that
they
know
all
about
it
!
If
*NL*
only
I
could
get
downstairs
!
And
what
if
they
have
set
a
watch
*NL*
there
--
policemen
!
What
's
this
tea
?
Ah
,
and
here
is
beer
left
,
half
a
*NL*
bottle
,
cold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
snatched
up
the
bottle
,
which
still
contained
a
glassful
of
beer
,
and
*NL*
gulped
it
down
with
relish
,
as
though
quenching
a
flame
in
his
breast
.
*NL*
But
in
another
minute
the
beer
had
gone
to
his
head
,
and
a
faint
and
*NL*
even
pleasant
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
.
He
lay
down
and
pulled
the
*NL*
quilt
over
him
.
His
sick
and
incoherent
thoughts
grew
more
and
more
*NL*
disconnected
,
and
soon
a
light
,
pleasant
drowsiness
came
upon
him
.
With
*NL*
a
sense
of
comfort
he
nestled
his
head
into
the
pillow
,
wrapped
more
*NL*
closely
about
him
the
soft
,
wadded
quilt
which
had
replaced
the
old
,
*NL*
ragged
greatcoat
,
sighed
softly
and
sank
into
a
deep
,
sound
,
refreshing
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
woke
up
,
hearing
someone
come
in
.
He
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
*NL*
Razumihin
standing
in
the
doorway
,
uncertain
whether
to
come
in
or
*NL*
not
.
Raskolnikov
sat
up
quickly
on
the
sofa
and
gazed
at
him
,
as
though
*NL*
trying
to
recall
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
not
asleep
!
Here
I
am
!
Nastasya
,
bring
in
the
parcel
!
''
*NL*
Razumihin
shouted
down
the
stairs
.
``
You
shall
have
the
account
*NL*
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
asked
Raskolnikov
,
looking
round
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
had
a
fine
sleep
,
brother
,
it
's
almost
evening
,
it
will
be
six
*NL*
o'clock
directly
.
You
have
slept
more
than
six
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
Have
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
It
will
do
you
good
.
What
's
the
hurry
?
A
tryst
,
is
it
?
*NL*
We
've
all
time
before
us
.
I
've
been
waiting
for
the
last
three
hours
for
*NL*
you
;
I
've
been
up
twice
and
found
you
asleep
.
I
've
called
on
Zossimov
*NL*
twice
;
not
at
home
,
only
fancy
!
But
no
matter
,
he
will
turn
up
.
And
*NL*
I
've
been
out
on
my
own
business
,
too
.
You
know
I
've
been
moving
to-day
,
*NL*
moving
with
my
uncle
.
I
have
an
uncle
living
with
me
now
.
But
that
's
*NL*
no
matter
,
to
business
.
Give
me
the
parcel
,
Nastasya
.
We
will
open
it
*NL*
directly
.
And
how
do
you
feel
now
,
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
well
,
I
am
not
ill
.
Razumihin
,
have
you
been
here
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
've
been
waiting
for
the
last
three
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
been
coming
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
I
told
you
all
about
it
this
morning
.
Do
n't
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
pondered
.
The
morning
seemed
like
a
dream
to
him
.
He
could
*NL*
not
remember
alone
,
and
looked
inquiringly
at
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
''
said
the
latter
,
``
he
has
forgotten
.
I
fancied
then
that
you
were
*NL*
not
quite
yourself
.
Now
you
are
better
for
your
sleep
...
You
really
*NL*
look
much
better
.
First-rate
!
Well
,
to
business
.
Look
here
,
my
dear
*NL*
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
untying
the
bundle
,
which
evidently
interested
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
brother
,
this
is
something
specially
near
my
heart
.
For
we
*NL*
must
make
a
man
of
you
.
Let
's
begin
from
the
top
.
Do
you
see
this
*NL*
cap
?
''
he
said
,
taking
out
of
the
bundle
a
fairly
good
though
cheap
and
*NL*
ordinary
cap
.
``
Let
me
try
it
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
,
afterwards
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
waving
it
off
pettishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Rodya
,
my
boy
,
do
n't
oppose
it
,
afterwards
will
be
too
late
;
and
*NL*
I
sha
n't
sleep
all
night
,
for
I
bought
it
by
guess
,
without
measure
.
*NL*
Just
right
!
''
he
cried
triumphantly
,
fitting
it
on
,
``
just
your
size
!
A
*NL*
proper
head-covering
is
the
first
thing
in
dress
and
a
recommendation
in
*NL*
its
own
way
.
Tolstyakov
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
is
always
obliged
to
take
off
*NL*
his
pudding
basin
when
he
goes
into
any
public
place
where
other
*NL*
people
wear
their
hats
or
caps
.
People
think
he
does
it
from
slavish
*NL*
politeness
,
but
it
's
simply
because
he
is
ashamed
of
his
bird
's
nest
;
*NL*
he
is
such
a
boastful
fellow
!
Look
,
Nastasya
,
here
are
two
specimens
of
*NL*
headgear
:
this
Palmerston
''
--
he
took
from
the
corner
Raskolnikov
's
old
,
*NL*
battered
hat
,
which
for
some
unknown
reason
,
he
called
a
Palmerston
--
``
or
*NL*
this
jewel
!
Guess
the
price
,
Rodya
,
what
do
you
suppose
I
paid
for
it
,
*NL*
Nastasya
!
''
he
said
,
turning
to
her
,
seeing
that
Raskolnikov
did
not
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
copecks
,
no
more
,
I
dare
say
,
''
answered
Nastasya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
copecks
,
silly
!
''
he
cried
,
offended
.
``
Why
,
nowadays
you
would
*NL*
cost
more
than
that
--
eighty
copecks
!
And
that
only
because
it
has
been
*NL*
worn
.
And
it
's
bought
on
condition
that
when
's
it
's
worn
out
,
they
will
*NL*
give
you
another
next
year
.
Yes
,
on
my
word
!
Well
,
now
let
us
pass
to
*NL*
the
United
States
of
America
,
as
they
called
them
at
school
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
I
am
proud
of
these
breeches
,
''
and
he
exhibited
to
Raskolnikov
a
*NL*
pair
of
light
,
summer
trousers
of
grey
woollen
material
.
``
No
holes
,
no
*NL*
spots
,
and
quite
respectable
,
although
a
little
worn
;
and
a
waistcoat
*NL*
to
match
,
quite
in
the
fashion
.
And
its
being
worn
really
is
an
*NL*
improvement
,
it
's
softer
,
smoother
...
You
see
,
Rodya
,
to
my
thinking
,
*NL*
the
great
thing
for
getting
on
in
the
world
is
always
to
keep
to
the
*NL*
seasons
;
if
you
do
n't
insist
on
having
asparagus
in
January
,
you
keep
*NL*
your
money
in
your
purse
;
and
it
's
the
same
with
this
purchase
.
It
's
*NL*
summer
now
,
so
I
've
been
buying
summer
things
--
warmer
materials
will
be
*NL*
wanted
for
autumn
,
so
you
will
have
to
throw
these
away
in
any
case
...
*NL*
especially
as
they
will
be
done
for
by
then
from
their
own
lack
of
*NL*
coherence
if
not
your
higher
standard
of
luxury
.
Come
,
price
them
!
What
*NL*
do
you
say
?
Two
roubles
twenty-five
copecks
!
And
remember
the
condition
:
*NL*
if
you
wear
these
out
,
you
will
have
another
suit
for
nothing
!
They
only
*NL*
do
business
on
that
system
at
Fedyaev
's
;
if
you
've
bought
a
thing
once
,
*NL*
you
are
satisfied
for
life
,
for
you
will
never
go
there
again
of
your
*NL*
own
free
will
.
Now
for
the
boots
.
What
do
you
say
?
You
see
that
they
are
*NL*
a
bit
worn
,
but
they
'll
last
a
couple
of
months
,
for
it
's
foreign
work
*NL*
and
foreign
leather
;
the
secretary
of
the
English
Embassy
sold
them
last
*NL*
week
--
he
had
only
worn
them
six
days
,
but
he
was
very
short
of
cash
.
*NL*
Price
--
a
rouble
and
a
half
.
A
bargain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
they
wo
n't
fit
,
''
observed
Nastasya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
fit
?
Just
look
!
''
and
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
Raskolnikov
's
*NL*
old
,
broken
boot
,
stiffly
coated
with
dry
mud
.
``
I
did
not
go
*NL*
empty-handed
--
they
took
the
size
from
this
monster
.
We
all
did
our
best
.
*NL*
And
as
to
your
linen
,
your
landlady
has
seen
to
that
.
Here
,
to
begin
*NL*
with
are
three
shirts
,
hempen
but
with
a
fashionable
front
...
Well
*NL*
now
then
,
eighty
copecks
the
cap
,
two
roubles
twenty-five
copecks
the
*NL*
suit
--
together
three
roubles
five
copecks
--
a
rouble
and
a
half
for
the
*NL*
boots
--
for
,
you
see
,
they
are
very
good
--
and
that
makes
four
roubles
*NL*
fifty-five
copecks
;
five
roubles
for
the
underclothes
--
they
were
*NL*
bought
in
the
lo
--
which
makes
exactly
nine
roubles
fifty-five
copecks
.
*NL*
Forty-five
copecks
change
in
coppers
.
Will
you
take
it
?
And
so
,
Rodya
,
*NL*
you
are
set
up
with
a
complete
new
rig-out
,
for
your
overcoat
will
*NL*
serve
,
and
even
has
a
style
of
its
own
.
That
comes
from
getting
one
's
*NL*
clothes
from
Sharmer
's
!
As
for
your
socks
and
other
things
,
I
leave
them
*NL*
to
you
;
we
've
twenty-five
roubles
left
.
And
as
for
Pashenka
and
paying
*NL*
for
your
lodging
,
do
n't
you
worry
.
I
tell
you
she
'll
trust
you
for
*NL*
anything
.
And
now
,
brother
,
let
me
change
your
linen
,
for
I
daresay
you
*NL*
will
throw
off
your
illness
with
your
shirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
!
I
do
n't
want
to
!
''
Raskolnikov
waved
him
off
.
He
had
listened
*NL*
with
disgust
to
Razumihin
's
efforts
to
be
playful
about
his
purchases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
brother
,
do
n't
tell
me
I
've
been
trudging
around
for
nothing
,
''
*NL*
Razumihin
insisted
.
``
Nastasya
,
do
n't
be
bashful
,
but
help
me
--
that
's
*NL*
it
,
''
and
in
spite
of
Raskolnikov
's
resistance
he
changed
his
linen
.
The
*NL*
latter
sank
back
on
the
pillows
and
for
a
minute
or
two
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
long
before
I
get
rid
of
them
,
''
he
thought
.
``
What
money
was
*NL*
all
that
bought
with
?
''
he
asked
at
last
,
gazing
at
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
?
Why
,
your
own
,
what
the
messenger
brought
from
Vahrushin
,
your
*NL*
mother
sent
it

Have
you
forgotten
that
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
now

''
said
Raskolnikov
after
a
long
,
sullen
silence
.
*NL*
Razumihin
looked
at
him
,
frowning
and
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
and
a
tall
,
stout
man
whose
appearance
seemed
familiar
*NL*
to
Raskolnikov
came
in
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Zossimov
was
a
tall
,
fat
man
with
a
puffy
,
colourless
,
clean-shaven
face
*NL*
and
straight
flaxen
hair
.
He
wore
spectacles
,
and
a
big
gold
ring
on
*NL*
his
fat
finger
.
He
was
twenty-seven
.
He
had
on
a
light
grey
fashionable
*NL*
loose
coat
,
light
summer
trousers
,
and
everything
about
him
loose
,
*NL*
fashionable
and
spick
and
span
;
his
linen
was
irreproachable
,
his
*NL*
watch-chain
was
massive
.
In
manner
he
was
slow
and
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
nonchalant
,
and
at
the
same
time
studiously
free
and
easy
;
he
made
*NL*
efforts
to
conceal
his
self-importance
,
but
it
was
apparent
at
every
*NL*
instant
.
All
his
acquaintances
found
him
tedious
,
but
said
he
was
clever
*NL*
at
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
you
twice
to-day
,
brother
.
You
see
,
he
's
come
to
himself
,
''
*NL*
cried
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
;
and
how
do
we
feel
now
,
eh
?
''
said
Zossimov
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
watching
him
carefully
and
,
sitting
down
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
sofa
,
he
settled
himself
as
comfortably
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
still
depressed
,
''
Razumihin
went
on
.
``
We
've
just
changed
his
*NL*
linen
and
he
almost
cried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
natural
;
you
might
have
put
it
off
if
he
did
not
wish
*NL*
it

His
pulse
is
first-rate

Is
your
head
still
aching
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
well
,
I
am
perfectly
well
!
''
Raskolnikov
declared
positively
*NL*
and
irritably
.
He
raised
himself
on
the
sofa
and
looked
at
them
with
*NL*
glittering
eyes
,
but
sank
back
on
to
the
pillow
at
once
and
turned
to
*NL*
the
wall
.
Zossimov
watched
him
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
...
Going
on
all
right
,
''
he
said
lazily
.
``
Has
he
eaten
*NL*
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
told
him
,
and
asked
what
he
might
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
have
anything
...
soup
,
tea

mushrooms
and
cucumbers
,
of
*NL*
course
,
you
must
not
give
him
;
he
'd
better
not
have
meat
either

...
*NL*

no
need
to
tell
you
that

Razumihin
and
he
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
.
``
No
more
medicine
or
anything

I
'll
look
at
him
again
to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow

shall
take
him

Razumihin

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
turned
to
the
wall
where
in
the
dirty
,
yellow
paper
he
*NL*
picked
out
one
clumsy
,
white
flower
with
brown
lines
on
it
and
began
*NL*
examining
how
many
petals
there
were
in
it
,
how
many
scallops
in
the
*NL*
petals
and
how
many
lines
on
them

He
felt
his
arms
and
legs
as
lifeless
*NL*
as
though
they
had
been
cut
off
.
He
did
not
attempt
to
move
,
but
stared
*NL*
obstinately
at
the
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
about
the
painter
?
''
Zossimov
interrupted
Nastasya
's
chatter
*NL*
with
marked
displeasure

She
sighed
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
was
accused
of
the
murder

Razumihin
went
on
hotly

``
Was
there
evidence
against
him
then

``
Evidence

indeed

Evidence

what
we

It
was
just
as
they
pitched
on

at
first

stupidly
it

sick

to-night

By
the
way

you

heard
about

it
happened
before

the

at
the
*NL*
police
office

were
talking
about
it

*NL*
*NL*

looked
curiously
at
Raskolnikov

He
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

I
say

Razumihin

I
wonder
at

you
are

Zossimov
observed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
am

we
will
get
him
off
anyway

shouted
Razumihin
,
*NL*
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
.
``
What
's
the
most
offensive
is
not

their
lying

one
can
always
forgive
lying

lying
is
a
delightful
thing

truth

is
offensive

that
they
lie
and
worship
*NL*
their
own
lying

I
respect
Porfiry
,
but
...
What
threw
them
out
at
*NL*
first
?
The
door
was
locked
,
and
when
they
came
back
with
the
porter
*NL*
it
was
open
.
So
it
followed
that
Koch
and
Pestryakov
were
the
*NL*
murderers

that
was
their
logic
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
excite
yourself
;
they
simply
detained
them

they
could
not
*NL*
help
that
...
And
,
by
the
way
,
I
've
met
that
man
Koch

He
used
to
buy
*NL*
unredeemed
pledges
from
the
old

Eh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

enough

angry

It

sickening
rotten

petrified
routine

hear
about
the
painter

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Well
,
here
's
the
story
.
Early
on
the
third
day
after
the
*NL*
murder
,
when
they
were
still
dandling
Koch
and
Pestryakov
--
though
they
*NL*
accounted
for
every
step
they
took
and
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
--
an
*NL*
unexpected
fact
turned
up
.
A
peasant
called
Dushkin
,
who
keeps
a
*NL*
dram-shop
facing
the
house
,
brought
to
the
police
office
a
jeweller
's
*NL*
case
containing
some
gold
ear-rings
,
and
told
a
long
rigamarole
.
`
The
*NL*
day
before
yesterday
,
just
after
eight
o'clock
'
--
mark
the
day
and
the
*NL*
hour
!
--
'
a
journeyman
house-painter
,
Nikolay
,
who
had
been
in
to
see
me
*NL*
already
that
day
,
brought
me
this
box
of
gold
ear-rings
and
stones
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
to
give
him
two
roubles
for
them
.
When
I
asked
him
where
he
got
*NL*
them
,
he
said
that
he
picked
them
up
in
the
street
.
I
did
not
ask
him
*NL*
anything
more
.
'
I
am
telling
you
Dushkin
's
story
.
'
I
gave
him
a
note
'
--
a
*NL*
rouble
that
is
--
`
for
I
thought
if
he
did
not
pawn
it
with
me
he
would
*NL*
with
another
.
It
would
all
come
to
the
same
thing
--
he
'd
spend
it
on
*NL*
drink
,
so
the
thing
had
better
be
with
me
.
The
further
you
hide
it
*NL*
the
quicker
you
will
find
it
,
and
if
anything
turns
up
,
if
I
hear
any
*NL*
rumours
,
I
'll
take
it
to
the
police
.
'
Of
course
,
that
's
all
taradiddle
;
*NL*
he
lies
like
a
horse
,
for
I
know
this
Dushkin
,
he
is
a
pawnbroker
and
*NL*
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
,
and
he
did
not
cheat
Nikolay
out
of
a
*NL*
thirty-rouble
trinket
in
order
to
give
it
to
the
police
.
He
was
simply
*NL*
afraid
.
But
no
matter
,
to
return
to
Dushkin
's
story
.
`
I
've
known
*NL*
this
peasant
,
Nikolay
Dementyev
,
from
a
child
;
he
comes
from
the
same
*NL*
province
and
district
of
Zaraisk
,
we
are
both
Ryazan
men
.
And
though
*NL*
Nikolay
is
not
a
drunkard
,
he
drinks
,
and
I
knew
he
had
a
job
in
that
*NL*
house
,
painting
work
with
Dmitri
,
who
comes
from
the
same
village
,
too
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
got
the
rouble
he
changed
it
,
had
a
couple
of
glasses
,
*NL*
took
his
change
and
went
out
.
But
I
did
not
see
Dmitri
with
him
then
.
*NL*
And
the
next
day
I
heard
that
someone
had
murdered
Alyona
Ivanovna
and
*NL*
her
sister
,
Lizaveta
Ivanovna
,
with
an
axe
.
I
knew
them
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
suspicious
about
the
ear-rings
at
once
,
for
I
knew
the
murdered
woman
*NL*
lent
money
on
pledges
.
I
went
to
the
house
,
and
began
to
make
careful
*NL*
inquiries
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
.
First
of
all
I
asked
,
``
Is
*NL*
Nikolay
here
?
''
Dmitri
told
me
that
Nikolay
had
gone
off
on
the
spree
;
he
*NL*
had
come
home
at
daybreak
drunk
,
stayed
in
the
house
about
ten
minutes
,
*NL*
and
went
out
again
.
Dmitri
did
n't
see
him
again
and
is
finishing
the
*NL*
job
alone
.
And
their
job
is
on
the
same
staircase
as
the
murder
,
on
*NL*
the
second
floor
.
When
I
heard
all
that
I
did
not
say
a
word
to
*NL*
anyone
'
--
that
's
Dushkin
's
tale
--
`
but
I
found
out
what
I
could
about
*NL*
the
murder
,
and
went
home
feeling
as
suspicious
as
ever
.
And
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
this
morning
'
--
that
was
the
third
day
,
you
understand
--
'
I
saw
*NL*
Nikolay
coming
in
,
not
sober
,
though
not
to
say
very
drunk
--
he
could
*NL*
understand
what
was
said
to
him
.
He
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
did
not
*NL*
speak
.
There
was
only
one
stranger
in
the
bar
and
a
man
I
knew
asleep
*NL*
on
a
bench
and
our
two
boys
.
``
Have
you
seen
Dmitri
?
''
said
I.
``
No
,
I
*NL*
have
n't
,
''
said
he
.
``
And
you
've
not
been
here
either
?
''
``
Not
since
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
,
''
said
he
.
``
And
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
?
''
*NL*
``
In
Peski
,
with
the
Kolomensky
men
.
''
``
And
where
did
you
get
those
*NL*
ear-rings
?
''
I
asked
.
``
I
found
them
in
the
street
,
''
and
the
way
he
said
*NL*
it
was
a
bit
queer
;
he
did
not
look
at
me
.
``
Did
you
hear
what
happened
*NL*
that
very
evening
,
at
that
very
hour
,
on
that
same
staircase
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
had
not
heard
,
''
and
all
the
while
he
was
listening
,
*NL*
his
eyes
were
staring
out
of
his
head
and
he
turned
as
white
as
chalk
.
I
*NL*
told
him
all
about
it
and
he
took
his
hat
and
began
getting
up
.
I
wanted
*NL*
to
keep
him
.
``
Wait
a
bit
,
Nikolay
,
''
said
I
,
``
wo
n't
you
have
a
drink
?
''
*NL*
And
I
signed
to
the
boy
to
hold
the
door
,
and
I
came
out
from
behind
the
*NL*
bar
;
but
he
darted
out
and
down
the
street
to
the
turning
at
a
run
.
*NL*
I
have
not
seen
him
since
.
Then
my
doubts
were
at
an
end
--
it
was
his
*NL*
doing
,
as
clear
as
could
be
...
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
,
''
said
Zossimov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
Hear
the
end
.
Of
course
they
sought
high
and
low
for
Nikolay
;
*NL*
they
detained
Dushkin
and
searched
his
house
;
Dmitri
,
too
,
was
arrested
;
*NL*
the
Kolomensky
men
also
were
turned
inside
out
.
And
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
they
arrested
Nikolay
in
a
tavern
at
the
end
of
the
town
.
He
*NL*
had
gone
there
,
taken
the
silver
cross
off
his
neck
and
asked
for
a
dram
*NL*
for
it
.
They
gave
it
to
him
.
A
few
minutes
afterwards
the
woman
went
*NL*
to
the
cowshed
,
and
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
she
saw
in
the
stable
*NL*
adjoining
he
had
made
a
noose
of
his
sash
from
the
beam
,
stood
on
a
*NL*
block
of
wood
,
and
was
trying
to
put
his
neck
in
the
noose
.
The
woman
*NL*
screeched
her
hardest
;
people
ran
in
.
`
So
that
's
what
you
are
up
to
!
'
*NL*
`
Take
me
,
'
he
says
,
`
to
such-and-such
a
police
officer
;
I
'll
confess
*NL*
everything
.
'
Well
,
they
took
him
to
that
police
station
--
that
is
*NL*
here
--
with
a
suitable
escort
.
So
they
asked
him
this
and
that
,
how
old
*NL*
he
is
,
`
twenty-two
,
'
and
so
on
.
At
the
question
,
`
When
you
were
working
*NL*
with
Dmitri
,
did
n't
you
see
anyone
on
the
staircase
at
such-and-such
a
*NL*
time
?
'
--
answer
:
`
To
be
sure
folks
may
have
gone
up
and
down
,
but
I
did
*NL*
not
notice
them
.
'
`
And
did
n't
you
hear
anything
,
any
noise
,
and
so
on
?
'
*NL*
`
We
heard
nothing
special
.
'
`
And
did
you
hear
,
Nikolay
,
that
on
the
same
*NL*
day
Widow
So-and-so
and
her
sister
were
murdered
and
robbed
?
'
'
I
*NL*
never
knew
a
thing
about
it
.
The
first
I
heard
of
it
was
from
Afanasy
*NL*
Pavlovitch
the
day
before
yesterday
.
'
`
And
where
did
you
find
the
*NL*
ear-rings
?
'
'
I
found
them
on
the
pavement
.
'
`
Why
did
n't
you
go
to
work
*NL*
with
Dmitri
the
other
day
?
'
`
Because
I
was
drinking
.
'
`
And
where
were
*NL*
you
drinking
?
'
`
Oh
,
in
such-and-such
a
place
.
'
`
Why
did
you
run
away
*NL*
from
Dushkin
's
?
'
`
Because
I
was
awfully
frightened
.
'
`
What
were
*NL*
you
frightened
of
?
'
`
That
I
should
be
accused
.
'
`
How
could
you
be
*NL*
frightened
,
if
you
felt
free
from
guilt
?
'
Now
,
Zossimov
,
you
may
not
*NL*
believe
me
,
that
question
was
put
literally
in
those
words
.
I
know
it
*NL*
for
a
fact
,
it
was
repeated
to
me
exactly
!
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
anyway
,
there
's
the
evidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
talking
of
the
evidence
now
,
I
am
talking
about
that
question
,
*NL*
of
their
own
idea
of
themselves
.
Well
,
so
they
squeezed
and
squeezed
*NL*
him
and
he
confessed
:
'
I
did
not
find
it
in
the
street
,
but
in
the
flat
*NL*
where
I
was
painting
with
Dmitri
.
'
`
And
how
was
that
?
'
`
Why
,
Dmitri
and
*NL*
I
were
painting
there
all
day
,
and
we
were
just
getting
ready
to
go
,
and
*NL*
Dmitri
took
a
brush
and
painted
my
face
,
and
he
ran
off
and
I
after
him
.
*NL*
I
ran
after
him
,
shouting
my
hardest
,
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
I
*NL*
ran
right
against
the
porter
and
some
gentlemen
--
and
how
many
gentlemen
*NL*
were
there
I
do
n't
remember
.
And
the
porter
swore
at
me
,
and
the
other
*NL*
porter
swore
,
too
,
and
the
porter
's
wife
came
out
,
and
swore
at
us
,
too
;
*NL*
and
a
gentleman
came
into
the
entry
with
a
lady
,
and
he
swore
at
us
,
*NL*
too
,
for
Dmitri
and
I
lay
right
across
the
way
.
I
got
hold
of
Dmitri
's
*NL*
hair
and
knocked
him
down
and
began
beating
him
.
And
Dmitri
,
too
,
caught
*NL*
me
by
the
hair
and
began
beating
me
.
But
we
did
it
all
not
for
temper
*NL*
but
in
a
friendly
way
,
for
sport
.
And
then
Dmitri
escaped
and
ran
into
*NL*
the
street
,
and
I
ran
after
him
;
but
I
did
not
catch
him
,
and
went
back
*NL*
to
the
flat
alone
;
I
had
to
clear
up
my
things
.
I
began
putting
them
*NL*
together
,
expecting
Dmitri
to
come
,
and
there
in
the
passage
,
in
the
*NL*
corner
by
the
door
,
I
stepped
on
the
box
.
I
saw
it
lying
there
wrapped
*NL*
up
in
paper
.
I
took
off
the
paper
,
saw
some
little
hooks
,
undid
them
,
*NL*
and
in
the
box
were
the
ear-rings
...

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behind
the
door
?
Lying
behind
the
door
?
Behind
the
door
?
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
cried
suddenly
,
staring
with
a
blank
look
of
terror
at
Razumihin
,
and
he
*NL*
slowly
sat
up
on
the
sofa
,
leaning
on
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
why
?
What
's
the
matter
?
What
's
wrong
?
''
Razumihin
,
too
,
got
up
*NL*
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
Raskolnikov
answered
faintly
,
turning
to
the
wall
.
All
were
*NL*
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
waked
from
a
dream
,
''
Razumihin
said
at
last
,
looking
*NL*
inquiringly
at
Zossimov
.
The
latter
slightly
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
on
,
''
said
Zossimov
.
``
What
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
As
soon
as
he
saw
the
ear-rings
,
forgetting
Dmitri
and
*NL*
everything
,
he
took
up
his
cap
and
ran
to
Dushkin
and
,
as
we
know
,
got
*NL*
a
rouble
from
him
.
He
told
a
lie
saying
he
found
them
in
the
street
,
and
*NL*
went
off
drinking
.
He
keeps
repeating
his
old
story
about
the
murder
:
*NL*
'
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
never
heard
of
it
till
the
day
before
yesterday

'
*NL*
`
And
why
did
n't
you
come
to
the
police
till
now
?
'
'
I
was
frightened
.
'
*NL*
`
And
why
did
you
try
to
hang
yourself
?
'
`
From
anxiety
.
'
`
What
anxiety
?
'
*NL*
`
That
I
should
be
accused
of
it
.
'
Well
,
that
's
the
whole
story
.
And
now
*NL*
what
do
you
suppose
they
deduced
from
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
no
supposing

There
's
a
clue

such

fact

You
*NL*
would
n't
have
your
painter
set
free

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
they

taken
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nonsense

You
are
excited

But
what
about
the
ear-rings

You
*NL*
must
admit
that

if
on
the
very
same
day
and
hour
ear-rings
from
the
old
*NL*
woman
's
box
have
come
into
Nikolay

they

*NL*
``
How

see
at

once

the
answers
he

given
in
the
examination

They
came
into
his
hand
precisely
as

has
told

stepped

on

picked
it
up

``
The

*NL*
``
Listen
to

The
porter

Pestryakov

the

porter

wife
of

first
porter

the
woman

was
sitting
in

porter
's
lodge

the
man
Kryukov

who
had
just
got
*NL*
out
of
a
cab
at
that
minute
and
went
in
at
the
entry
with
a
lady
on
his
*NL*
arm
,
that
is
eight
or
ten
witnesses
,
agree
that
Nikolay
had
Dmitri
on

the
ground

was
lying
on
him
beating
him
,
while
Dmitri
hung
on
to
his
*NL*
hair
,
beating
him

too

They
lay
right
across
the
way

blocking
the
*NL*
thoroughfare

They
were

at
on
all
sides
while
they
`
like
children

the
very
words

squealing

fighting

laughing
with
the
funniest

chasing

one
another

children

they
ran
into
the
street

Now
take
careful
*NL*
note

The
bodies
upstairs
were
warm

you

warm
when

found

If

murdered

allow

question

do
their
state

mind

their
squeals

giggles
and
childish
*NL*
scuffling
at
the
gate
fit
in
with
axes
,
bloodshed
,
fiendish
cunning
,
*NL*
robbery
?
They
'd
just
killed
them
,
not
five
or
ten
minutes
before
,
for
*NL*
the
bodies
were
still
warm
,
and
at
once
,
leaving
the
flat
open

knowing
*NL*
that
people
would
go
there
at
once
,
flinging
away
their
booty
,
they
*NL*
rolled
about
like
children
,
laughing
and
attracting
general
attention
.
*NL*
And
there
are
a
dozen
witnesses
to
swear
to
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
strange

It
's
impossible

indeed
,
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

brother

no

And
if
the
ear-rings
being
found
in
Nikolay
's
*NL*
hands
at
the
very
day
and
hour
of
the
murder
constitutes
an
important
*NL*
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
--
although
the
explanation
*NL*
given
by
him
accounts
for
it
,
and
therefore
it
does
not
tell
seriously
*NL*
against
him
--
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
facts
which
prove
him
*NL*
innocent
,
especially
as
they
are
facts
that
_
can
not
be
denied
_
.
And
*NL*
do
you
suppose
,
from
the
character
of
our
legal
system
,
that
they
will
*NL*
accept
,
or
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
accept
,
this
fact

resting
*NL*
simply
on
a
psychological
impossibility

as
irrefutable
and
conclusively
*NL*
breaking
down
the
circumstantial
evidence
for
the
prosecution
?
No
,
they
*NL*
wo
n't
accept
it
,
they
certainly
wo
n't
,
because
they
found
the
jewel-case
*NL*
and
the
man
tried
to
hang
himself
,
`
which
he
could
not
have
done
if
he
*NL*
had
n't
felt
guilty

That
's
the
point

that
's
what
excites
me

you
must
*NL*
understand

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
see

a
bit

I
forgot
to

you

what
proof

is
there
that
the
box
came
from
the
old
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

Razumihin

apparent
reluctance

frowning

recognised

gave
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

another
point

Did
anyone

were
going
upstairs
at
first

there
no

``
Nobody

Razumihin

with
vexation

``

worst
of

going
*NL*
on
in
it
,
but
they
took
no
special
notice
and
could
not
remember
whether
*NL*
there
actually
were
men
at
work
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
...
So
the
only
evidence
for
the
defence
is
that
they
were
beating
*NL*
one
another
and
laughing
.
That
constitutes
a
strong
presumption
,
but
...
*NL*
How
do
you
explain
the
facts
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
explain
them
?
What
is
there
to
explain
?
It
's
clear
.
At
any
*NL*
rate
,
the
direction
in
which
explanation
is
to
be
sought
is
clear
,
and
*NL*
the
jewel-case
points
to
it
.
The
real
murderer
dropped
those
ear-rings
.
*NL*
The
murderer
was
upstairs
,
locked
in
,
when
Koch
and
Pestryakov
knocked
*NL*
at
the
door
.
Koch
,
like
an
ass
,
did
not
stay
at
the
door
;
so
the
*NL*
murderer
popped
out
and
ran
down
,
too
;
for
he
had
no
other
way
of
*NL*
escape
.
He
hid
from
Koch
,
Pestryakov
and
the
porter
in
the
flat
when
*NL*
Nikolay
and
Dmitri
had
just
run
out
of
it
.
He
stopped
there
while
the
*NL*
porter
and
others
were
going
upstairs
,
waited
till
they
were
out
of
*NL*
hearing
,
and
then
went
calmly
downstairs
at
the
very
minute
when
Dmitri
*NL*
and
Nikolay
ran
out
into
the
street
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
entry
;
*NL*
possibly
he
was
seen
,
but
not
noticed
.
There
are
lots
of
people
going
*NL*
in
and
out
.
He
must
have
dropped
the
ear-rings
out
of
his
pocket
when
*NL*
he
stood
behind
the
door
,
and
did
not
notice
he
dropped
them
,
because
he
*NL*
had
other
things
to
think
of
.
The
jewel-case
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
*NL*
he
did
stand
there
...
That
's
how
I
explain
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
clever
!
No
,
my
boy
,
you
're
too
clever
.
That
beats
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
why
,
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
because
everything
fits
too
well
...
it
's
too
melodramatic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ach
!
''
Razumihin
was
exclaiming
,
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
*NL*
and
a
personage
came
in
who
was
a
stranger
to
all
present
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
gentleman
no
longer
young
,
of
a
stiff
and
portly
appearance
,
*NL*
and
a
cautious
and
sour
countenance
.
He
began
by
stopping
short
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
staring
about
him
with
offensive
and
undisguised
astonishment
,
*NL*
as
though
asking
himself
what
sort
of
place
he
had
come
to
.
*NL*
Mistrustfully
and
with
an
affectation
of
being
alarmed
and
almost
*NL*
affronted
,
he
scanned
Raskolnikov
's
low
and
narrow
``
cabin
.
''
With
the
*NL*
same
amazement
he
stared
at
Raskolnikov
,
who
lay
undressed
,
dishevelled
,
*NL*
unwashed
,
on
his
miserable
dirty
sofa
,
looking
fixedly
at
him
.
Then
with
*NL*
the
same
deliberation
he
scrutinised
the
uncouth
,
unkempt
figure
and
*NL*
unshaven
face
of
Razumihin
,
who
looked
him
boldly
and
inquiringly
in
the
*NL*
face
without
rising
from
his
seat
.
A
constrained
silence
lasted
for
a
*NL*
couple
of
minutes
,
and
then
,
as
might
be
expected
,
some
scene-shifting
*NL*
took
place
.
Reflecting
,
probably
from
certain
fairly
unmistakable
signs
,
*NL*
that
he
would
get
nothing
in
this
``
cabin
''
by
attempting
to
overawe
them
,
*NL*
the
gentleman
softened
somewhat
,
and
civilly
,
though
with
some
severity
,
*NL*
emphasising
every
syllable
of
his
question
,
addressed
Zossimov
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodion
Romanovitch
Raskolnikov
,
a
student
,
or
formerly
a
student
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zossimov
made
a
slight
movement
,
and
would
have
answered
,
had
not
*NL*
Razumihin
anticipated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
lying
on
the
sofa
!
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
familiar
``
what
do
you
want
''
seemed
to
cut
the
ground
from
the
*NL*
feet
of
the
pompous
gentleman
.
He
was
turning
to
Razumihin
,
but
checked
*NL*
himself
in
time
and
turned
to
Zossimov
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Raskolnikov
,
''
mumbled
Zossimov
,
nodding
towards
him
.
Then
he
*NL*
gave
a
prolonged
yawn
,
opening
his
mouth
as
wide
as
possible
.
Then
he
*NL*
lazily
put
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat-pocket
,
pulled
out
a
huge
gold
*NL*
watch
in
a
round
hunter
's
case
,
opened
it
,
looked
at
it
and
as
slowly
*NL*
and
lazily
proceeded
to
put
it
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
himself
lay
without
speaking
,
on
his
back
,
gazing
*NL*
persistently
,
though
without
understanding
,
at
the
stranger
.
Now
that
*NL*
his
face
was
turned
away
from
the
strange
flower
on
the
paper
,
it
*NL*
was
extremely
pale
and
wore
a
look
of
anguish
,
as
though
he
had
just
*NL*
undergone
an
agonising
operation
or
just
been
taken
from
the
rack
.
But
*NL*
the
new-comer
gradually
began
to
arouse
his
attention
,
then
his
wonder
,
*NL*
then
suspicion
and
even
alarm
.
When
Zossimov
said
``
This
is
Raskolnikov
''
*NL*
he
jumped
up
quickly
,
sat
on
the
sofa
and
with
an
almost
defiant
,
but
*NL*
weak
and
breaking
,
voice
articulated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
Raskolnikov
!
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
scrutinised
him
and
pronounced
impressively
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pyotr
Petrovitch
Luzhin
.
I
believe
I
have
reason
to
hope
that
my
name
*NL*
is
not
wholly
unknown
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Raskolnikov
,
who
had
expected
something
quite
different
,
gazed
*NL*
blankly
and
dreamily
at
him
,
making
no
reply
,
as
though
he
heard
the
*NL*
name
of
Pyotr
Petrovitch
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
you
can
up
to
the
present
have
received
no
*NL*
information
?
''
asked
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
somewhat
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
Raskolnikov
sank
languidly
back
on
the
pillow
,
put
his
hands
*NL*
behind
his
head
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
.
A
look
of
dismay
came
into
*NL*
Luzhin
's
face
.
Zossimov
and
Razumihin
stared
at
him
more
inquisitively
*NL*
than
ever
,
and
at
last
he
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
presumed
and
calculated
,
''
he
faltered
,
``
that
a
letter
posted
more
*NL*
than
ten
days
,
if
not
a
fortnight
ago
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
why
are
you
standing
in
the
doorway
?
''
Razumihin
interrupted
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
If
you
've
something
to
say
,
sit
down
.
Nastasya
and
you
are
so
*NL*
crowded
.
Nastasya
,
make
room
.
Here
's
a
chair
,
thread
your
way
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
his
chair
back
from
the
table
,
made
a
little
space
between
the
*NL*
table
and
his
knees
,
and
waited
in
a
rather
cramped
position
for
the
*NL*
visitor
to
``
thread
his
way
in
.
''
The
minute
was
so
chosen
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
refuse
,
and
the
visitor
squeezed
his
way
through
,
hurrying
*NL*
and
stumbling
.
Reaching
the
chair
,
he
sat
down
,
looking
suspiciously
at
*NL*
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
need
to
be
nervous
,
''
the
latter
blurted
out
.
``
Rodya
has
been
ill
for
*NL*
the
last
five
days
and
delirious
for
three
,
but
now
he
is
recovering
and
*NL*
has
got
an
appetite
.
This
is
his
doctor
,
who
has
just
had
a
look
at
him
.
*NL*
I
am
a
comrade
of
Rodya
's
,
like
him
,
formerly
a
student
,
and
now
I
am
*NL*
nursing
him
;
so
do
n't
you
take
any
notice
of
us
,
but
go
on
with
your
*NL*
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
But
shall
I
not
disturb
the
invalid
by
my
presence
and
*NL*
conversation
?
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
asked
of
Zossimov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
,
''
mumbled
Zossimov
;
``
you
may
amuse
him
.
''
He
yawned
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
conscious
a
long
time
,
since
the
morning
,
''
went
on
*NL*
Razumihin
,
whose
familiarity
seemed
so
much
like
unaffected
good-nature
*NL*
that
Pyotr
Petrovitch
began
to
be
more
cheerful
,
partly
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
because
this
shabby
and
impudent
person
had
introduced
himself
as
a
*NL*
student
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mamma
,
''
began
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
''
Razumihin
cleared
his
throat
loudly
.
Luzhin
looked
at
him
*NL*
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Luzhin
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mamma
had
commenced
a
letter
to
you
while
I
was
sojourning
in
*NL*
her
neighbourhood
.
On
my
arrival
here
I
purposely
allowed
a
few
days
to
*NL*
elapse
before
coming
to
see
you
,
in
order
that
I
might
be
fully
*NL*
assured
that
you
were
in
full
possession
of
the
tidings
;
but
now
,
to
my
*NL*
astonishment
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
!
''
Raskolnikov
cried
suddenly
with
impatient
vexation
.
*NL*
``
So
you
are
the
_
fiance
_
?
I
know
,
and
that
's
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
doubt
about
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
being
offended
this
time
,
*NL*
but
he
said
nothing
.
He
made
a
violent
effort
to
understand
what
it
all
*NL*
meant
.
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Raskolnikov
,
who
had
turned
a
little
towards
him
when
he
*NL*
answered
,
began
suddenly
staring
at
him
again
with
marked
curiosity
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
not
had
a
good
look
at
him
yet
,
or
as
though
something
*NL*
new
had
struck
him
;
he
rose
from
his
pillow
on
purpose
to
stare
at
*NL*
him
.
There
certainly
was
something
peculiar
in
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
whole
*NL*
appearance
,
something
which
seemed
to
justify
the
title
of
``
fiance
''
so
*NL*
unceremoniously
applied
to
him
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
was
evident
,
far
*NL*
too
much
so
indeed
,
that
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
made
eager
use
of
his
few
*NL*
days
in
the
capital
to
get
himself
up
and
rig
himself
out
in
expectation
*NL*
of
his
betrothed
--
a
perfectly
innocent
and
permissible
proceeding
,
*NL*
indeed
.
Even
his
own
,
perhaps
too
complacent
,
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
agreeable
improvement
in
his
appearance
might
have
been
forgiven
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
,
seeing
that
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
taken
up
the
role
of
*NL*
fiance
.
All
his
clothes
were
fresh
from
the
tailor
's
and
were
all
*NL*
right
,
except
for
being
too
new
and
too
distinctly
appropriate
.
Even
*NL*
the
stylish
new
round
hat
had
the
same
significance
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
*NL*
treated
it
too
respectfully
and
held
it
too
carefully
in
his
hands
.
The
*NL*
exquisite
pair
of
lavender
gloves
,
real
Louvain
,
told
the
same
tale
,
*NL*
if
only
from
the
fact
of
his
not
wearing
them
,
but
carrying
them
in
*NL*
his
hand
for
show
.
Light
and
youthful
colours
predominated
in
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
's
attire
.
He
wore
a
charming
summer
jacket
of
a
fawn
shade
,
*NL*
light
thin
trousers
,
a
waistcoat
of
the
same
,
new
and
fine
linen
,
a
*NL*
cravat
of
the
lightest
cambric
with
pink
stripes
on
it
,
and
the
best
*NL*
of
it
was
,
this
all
suited
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
His
very
fresh
and
even
*NL*
handsome
face
looked
younger
than
his
forty-five
years
at
all
times
.
*NL*
His
dark
,
mutton-chop
whiskers
made
an
agreeable
setting
on
both
sides
,
*NL*
growing
thickly
upon
his
shining
,
clean-shaven
chin
.
Even
his
hair
,
*NL*
touched
here
and
there
with
grey
,
though
it
had
been
combed
and
curled
*NL*
at
a
hairdresser
's
,
did
not
give
him
a
stupid
appearance
,
as
curled
hair
*NL*
usually
does
,
by
inevitably
suggesting
a
German
on
his
wedding-day
.
*NL*
If
there
really
was
something
unpleasing
and
repulsive
in
his
rather
*NL*
good-looking
and
imposing
countenance
,
it
was
due
to
quite
other
*NL*
causes
.
After
scanning
Mr.
Luzhin
unceremoniously
,
Raskolnikov
smiled
*NL*
malignantly
,
sank
back
on
the
pillow
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
as
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Luzhin
hardened
his
heart
and
seemed
to
determine
to
take
no
*NL*
notice
of
their
oddities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
the
greatest
regret
at
finding
you
in
this
situation
,
''
he
began
,
*NL*
again
breaking
the
silence
with
an
effort
.
``
If
I
had
been
aware
of
your
*NL*
illness
I
should
have
come
earlier
.
But
you
know
what
business
is
.
I
*NL*
have
,
too
,
a
very
important
legal
affair
in
the
Senate
,
not
to
mention
*NL*
other
preoccupations
which
you
may
well
conjecture
.
I
am
expecting
your
*NL*
mamma
and
sister
any
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
made
a
movement
and
seemed
about
to
speak
;
his
face
showed
*NL*
some
excitement
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
paused
,
waited
,
but
as
nothing
*NL*
followed
,
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
Any
minute
.
I
have
found
a
lodging
for
them
on
their
arrival
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
asked
Raskolnikov
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
near
here
,
in
Bakaleyev
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
in
Voskresensky
,
''
put
in
Razumihin
.
``
There
are
two
storeys
of
*NL*
rooms

by
a
merchant
called
Yushin
;
I
've
been
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
rooms
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
disgusting
place
--
filthy
,
stinking
and
,
what
's
more
,
of
doubtful
*NL*
character

Things
have
happened
there
,
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
queer
*NL*
people
living
there
.
And
I
went
there
about
a
scandalous
business

It

cheap

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not

find
out

much
about
it

Petersburg
myself

Pyotr
Petrovitch
replied
huffily
.
``
However
,
the
*NL*
two
rooms
are
exceedingly
clean

and
as

he
said
,
*NL*
addressing
Raskolnikov
,
``
and
I
am
having
it
done
up

I
am

cramped
for

in

my
friend
Andrey
Semyonovitch

Lebeziatnikov

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lebeziatnikov

said
Raskolnikov
slowly
,
as

recalling
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Andrey
Semyonovitch
Lebeziatnikov

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Raskolnikov
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse

I
fancied
so
from

was
once
his

advanced

I
like

Luzhin
looked
round
hopefully
at
them
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you

asked
Razumihin
.
*NL*

Pyotr
Petrovitch
replied
,
*NL*
as
though
delighted
at
the
question

``
You
see

it
's
ten
years

I
*NL*
visited
Petersburg

All
the
novelties

have
reached
us
in

the
provinces
,
but
to
see
it
all
more
clearly
one
must
be
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
And
it
's
my
notion
that
you
observe
and
learn
most
by
watching
the
*NL*
younger
generation

I
confess
I
am
delighted

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
question
is
a
wide
one

I
may
be
mistaken

I
fancy
I
find
*NL*
clearer

more

so
to

criticism

more
practicality

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

Zossimov
let
drop

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

There

no

Razumihin
flew
at
him
.
*NL*
``
Practicality
is
a
difficult
thing
to
find
;
it
does
not
drop
down
from
*NL*
heaven
.
And
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
we
have
been
divorced
from
*NL*
all
practical
life
.
Ideas
,
if
you
like
,
are
fermenting
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
``
and
desire
for
good
exists
,
though
it
's
in
a
childish
*NL*
form
,
and
honesty
you
may
find
,
although
there
are
crowds
of
brigands
.
*NL*
Anyway
,
there
's
no
practicality

Practicality
goes
well
shod
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
,
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
replied
,
with
evident
*NL*
enjoyment
.
``
Of
course
,
people
do
get
carried
away
and
make
mistakes
,
*NL*
but
one
must
have
indulgence
;
those
mistakes
are
merely
evidence
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
and
of
abnormal
external
environment
.
If
little
*NL*
has
been
done
,
the
time
has
been
but
short
;
of
means
I
will
not
speak

*NL*
It
's
my
personal
view
,
if
you
care
to
know
,
that
something
has
been
*NL*
accomplished
already
.
New
valuable
ideas
,
new
valuable
works
are
*NL*
circulating
in
the
place
of
our
old
dreamy
and
romantic
authors
.
*NL*
Literature
is
taking
a
maturer
form
,
many
injurious
prejudices
have
been
*NL*
rooted
up
and
turned
into
ridicule
...
In
a
word
,
we
have
cut
ourselves
*NL*
off
irrevocably
from
the
past
,
and
that
,
to
my
thinking
,
is
a
great
*NL*
thing
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
learnt
it
by
heart
to
show
off
!
''
Raskolnikov
pronounced
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
not
catching
his
words
;
but
he
received
*NL*
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
true
,
''
Zossimov
hastened
to
interpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
so
?
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
went
on
,
glancing
affably
at
Zossimov
.
*NL*
``
You
must
admit
,
''
he
went
on
,
addressing
Razumihin
with
a
shade
of
*NL*
triumph
and
superciliousness
--
he
almost
added
``
young
man
''
--
``
that
there
*NL*
is
an
advance
,
or
,
as
they
say
now
,
progress
in
the
name
of
science
and
*NL*
economic
truth
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
commonplace

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
a
commonplace
!
Hitherto
,
for
instance
,
if
I
were
told
,
`
love
*NL*
thy
neighbour
,
'
what
came
of
it
?
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
went
on
,
perhaps
with
*NL*
excessive
haste
.
``
It
came
to
my
tearing
my
coat
in
half
to
share
with
my
*NL*
neighbour
and
we
both
were
left
half
naked
.
As
a
Russian
proverb
has
*NL*
it
,
`
Catch
several
hares
and
you
wo
n't
catch
one
.
'
Science
now
tells
*NL*
us
,
love
yourself
before
all
men
,
for
everything
in
the
world
rests
on
*NL*
self-interest
.
You
love
yourself
and
manage
your
own
affairs
properly
*NL*
and
your
coat
remains
whole
.
Economic
truth
adds
that
the
better
private
*NL*
affairs
are
organised
in
society
--
the
more
whole
coats
,
so
to
say
--
the
*NL*
firmer
are
its
foundations
and
the
better
is
the
common
welfare
*NL*
organised
too
.
Therefore
,
in
acquiring
wealth
solely
and
exclusively
for
*NL*
myself
,
I
am
acquiring

so
to
speak
,
for
all

and
helping
to
bring
to
*NL*
pass
my
neighbour
's
getting
a
little
more
than
a
torn
coat
;
and
that
not
*NL*
from
private
,
personal
liberality
,
but
as
a
consequence
of
the
general
*NL*
advance
.
The
idea
is
simple
,
but
unhappily
it
has
been
a
long
time
*NL*
reaching
us
,
being
hindered
by
idealism
and
sentimentality
.
And
yet
it
*NL*
would
seem
to
want
very
little
wit
to
perceive
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
I
've
very
little
wit
myself
,
''
Razumihin
cut
in
sharply
,
*NL*
``
and
so
let
us
drop
it
.
I
began
this
discussion
with
an
object
,
but
I
've
*NL*
grown
so
sick
during
the
last
three
years
of
this
chattering
to
amuse
*NL*
oneself
,
of
this
incessant
flow
of
commonplaces
,
always
the
same
,
that
,
*NL*
by
Jove
,
I
blush
even
when
other
people
talk
like
that
.
You
are
in
a
*NL*
hurry
,
no
doubt
,
to
exhibit
your
acquirements
;
and
I
do
n't
blame
you
,
*NL*
that
's
quite
pardonable
.
I
only
wanted
to
find
out
what
sort
of
man
you
*NL*
are
,
for
so
many
unscrupulous
people
have
got
hold
of
the
progressive
*NL*
cause
of
late
and
have
so
distorted
in
their
own
interests
everything
*NL*
they
touched

that
the
whole
cause
has
been
dragged
in
the
mire

That
's
*NL*
enough
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse

said
Luzhin
,
affronted
,
and
speaking
with
excessive
*NL*
dignity

``
Do
you

so
unceremoniously

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

how

I

Come

Razumihin
*NL*
concluded
,
and
he
turned
abruptly
to
Zossimov
to
continue
their
previous
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
the
good
sense
to
accept
the
disavowal
.
He
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
to
take
leave
in
another
minute
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
our
acquaintance

''
he
said
,
addressing
Raskolnikov
,
``
may
,
upon
*NL*
your
recovery

in

the
circumstances

Above
all
,
I
hope
for
your
return
to
health

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
did
not
even
turn
his
head
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
began
getting
*NL*
up
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
her
customers
must
have
killed
her

Zossimov
declared
*NL*
positively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
doubt
of
it

''
replied
Razumihin
.
``
Porfiry
does
n't
give
his
*NL*
opinion

is
examining
all
who
have
left
pledges
with
her
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Examining
them

Raskolnikov
asked
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

What
then

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
he
get
hold
of
them
?
''
asked
Zossimov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Koch
has
given
the
names
of
some
of
them
,
other
names
are
on
the
*NL*
wrappers
of
the
pledges
and
some
have
come
forward
of
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
a
cunning
and
practised
ruffian
!
The
boldness
of
it
!
*NL*
The
coolness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
it
was
n't
!
''
interposed
Razumihin
.
``
That
's
what
throws
*NL*
you
all
off
the
scent
.
But
I
maintain
that
he
is
not
cunning
,
not
*NL*
practised
,
and
probably
this
was
his
first
crime
!
The
supposition
that
*NL*
it
was
a
calculated
crime
and
a
cunning
criminal
does
n't
work
.
Suppose
*NL*
him
to
have
been
inexperienced
,
and
it
's
clear
that
it
was
only
a
chance
*NL*
that
saved
him
--
and
chance
may
do
anything
.
Why
,
he
did
not
foresee
*NL*
obstacles
,
perhaps
!
And
how
did
he
set
to
work
?
He
took
jewels
worth
*NL*
ten
or
twenty
roubles
,
stuffing
his
pockets
with
them
,
ransacked
the
*NL*
old
woman
's
trunks
,
her
rags

and
they
found
fifteen
hundred
roubles
,
*NL*
besides
notes
,
in
a
box
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
chest
!
He
did
not
know
*NL*
how
to
rob
;
he
could
only
murder
.
It
was
his
first
crime
,
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
his
first
crime
;
he
lost
his
head
.
And
he
got
off
more
by
luck
than
good
*NL*
counsel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
talking
of
the
murder
of
the
old
pawnbroker

I
believe

''
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
put
in
,
addressing
Zossimov
.
He
was
standing
,
hat
and
gloves
*NL*
in
hand
,
but
before
departing
he
felt
disposed
to
throw
off
a
few
more
*NL*
intellectual
phrases
.
He
was
evidently
anxious
to
make
a
favourable
*NL*
impression
and
his
vanity
overcame
his
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

You
've
heard
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
that
;
but
another
circumstance
interests
me
in
the
*NL*
case
--
the
whole
question
,
so
to
say
.
Not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
crime
*NL*
has
been
greatly
on
the
increase
among
the
lower
classes
during
the
last
*NL*
five
years
,
not
to
speak
of
the
cases
of
robbery
and
arson
everywhere
,
*NL*
what
strikes
me
as
the
strangest
thing
is
that
in
the
higher
classes
,
*NL*
too
,
crime
is
increasing
proportionately
.
In
one
place
one
hears
of
a
*NL*
student
's
robbing
the
mail
on
the
high
road
;
in
another
place
people
of
*NL*
good
social
position
forge
false
banknotes
;
in
Moscow
of
late
a
whole
*NL*
gang
has
been
captured
who
used
to
forge
lottery
tickets
,
and
one
of
*NL*
the
ringleaders
was
a
lecturer
in
universal
history
;
then
our
secretary
*NL*
abroad
was
murdered
from
some
obscure
motive
of
gain
...
And
if
this
old
*NL*
woman
,
the
pawnbroker
,
has
been
murdered
by
someone
of
a
higher
class
*NL*
in
society
--
for
peasants
do
n't
pawn
gold
trinkets
--
how
are
we
to
explain
*NL*
this
demoralisation
of
the
civilised
part
of
our
society
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
many
economic
changes
,
''
put
in
Zossimov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
we
to
explain
it

''
Razumihin
caught
him
up
.
``
It

be

explained
by

inveterate
impracticality

``

``

your

I
do

the
upshot

that

to
me
in

with
all
her
excellent
qualities

of
a
somewhat
*NL*
high-flown
and

But
I
was
a

miles

fanciful

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

cried
Raskolnikov
,
raising
himself
on
his
pillow
and
*NL*
fixing
his
piercing
,
glittering
eyes
upon
him
,
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
Luzhin
stood
still
,
waiting
with
a
defiant
and
offended
face
.
*NL*
Silence
lasted
for
some
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
ever
again

*NL*
*NL*

cried
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
how
it
is
?
''
Luzhin
turned
pale
and
bit
his
lip
.
``
Let
me
tell
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
''
he
began
deliberately
,
doing
his
utmost
to
restrain
himself
*NL*
but
breathing
hard
,
``
at
the
first
moment
I
saw
you
you
were
ill-disposed
*NL*
to
me
,
but
I
remained
here
on
purpose
to
find
out
more
.
I
could
forgive
*NL*
a
great
deal
in
a
sick
man
and
a
connection
,
but
you

never
after

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Raskolnikov

*NL*
``
So
much

*NL*
``
Go

*NL*
But
Luzhin
was
already
leaving
without
finishing
his
speech
,
squeezing
*NL*
between
the
table
and
the
chair
;
Razumihin
got
up
this
time
to
let
him
*NL*
pass
.
Without
glancing
at
anyone
,
and
not
even
nodding
to
Zossimov
,
who
*NL*
had
for
some
time
been
making
signs
to
him
to
let
the
sick
man
alone
,
*NL*
he
went
out
,
lifting
his
hat
to
the
level
of
his
shoulders
to
avoid
*NL*
crushing
it
as
he
stooped
to
go
out
of
the
door
.
And
even
the
curve
of
*NL*
his
spine
was
expressive
of
the
horrible
insult
he
had
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
--
how
could
you
!
''
Razumihin
said
,
shaking
his
head
in
*NL*
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

alone

let

alone
all

Raskolnikov
cried
in
a
frenzy
.
*NL*
``
Will
you
ever
leave
off
tormenting

I
am
not
afraid

I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``

Zossimov

nodding
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along

Zossimov
repeated
insistently
,
and
he
went
out
.
Razumihin
*NL*
thought
a
minute
and
ran
to
overtake
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
worse
not
to
obey
him

said
Zossimov
on
the
stairs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
that

Pyotr
Petrovitch

From
his
conversation

I
gather
he
is
going

marry
his
sister

and
that
he
had
received
a

about

just
before
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

Razumihin
agreed
,
``
I
noticed
that

too

He
is
interested

frightened

It
gave
him
a
shock

ill
in
the

he
fainted

half
an

``
Thanks

'll

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
left
alone
,
looked
with
impatience
and
misery
at
Nastasya
,
*NL*
but
she
still
lingered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't

have
some
tea

she
asked
.

*NL*
``

turned
abruptly

Nastasya
went

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
she
went
out
,
he
got
up
,
latched
the
door
,
undid
the
*NL*
parcel
which
Razumihin
had
brought
in
that
evening
and
had
tied
up
again
*NL*
and
began
dressing
.
Strange
to
say
,
he
seemed
immediately
to
have
become
*NL*
perfectly
calm
;
not
a
trace
of
his
recent
delirium
nor
of
the
panic
*NL*
fear
that
had
haunted
him
of
late
.
It
was
the
first
moment
of
a
strange
*NL*
sudden
calm
.
His
movements
were
precise
and
definite
;
a
firm
purpose
was
*NL*
evident
in
them
.
``
To-day
,
to-day
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
.
He
understood
*NL*
that
he
was
still
weak
,
but
his
intense
spiritual
concentration
gave
him
*NL*
strength
and
self-confidence
.
He
hoped
,
moreover
,
that
he
would
not
*NL*
fall
down
in
the
street
.
When
he
had
dressed
in
entirely
new
clothes
,
he
*NL*
looked
at
the
money
lying
on
the
table
,
and
after
a
moment
's
thought
*NL*
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
It
was
twenty-five
roubles
.
He
took
also
all
the
*NL*
copper
change
from
the
ten
roubles
spent
by
Razumihin
on
the
clothes
.
*NL*
Then
he
softly
unlatched
the
door
,
went
out
,
slipped
downstairs
and
*NL*
glanced
in
at
the
open
kitchen
door
.
Nastasya
was
standing
with
her
back
*NL*
to
him
,
blowing
up
the
landlady
's
samovar
.
She
heard
nothing
.
Who
would
*NL*
have
dreamed
of
his
going
out
,
indeed
?
A
minute
later
he
was
in
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
eight
o'clock
,
the
sun
was
setting
.
It
was
as
stifling
as
*NL*
before
,
but
he
eagerly
drank
in
the
stinking
,
dusty
town
air
.
His
head
*NL*
felt
rather
dizzy
;
a
sort
of
savage
energy
gleamed
suddenly
in
his
*NL*
feverish
eyes
and
his
wasted
,
pale
and
yellow
face
.
He
did
not
know
and
*NL*
did
not
think
where
he
was
going
,
he
had
one
thought
only
:
``
that
all
*NL*
_
this
_
must
be
ended
to-day
,
once
for
all
,
immediately
;
that
he
would
*NL*
not
return
home
without
it
,
because
he
_
would
not
go
on
living
like
*NL*
that
_
.
''
How
,
with
what
to
make
an
end
?
He
had
not
an
idea
about
it
,
*NL*
he
did
not
even
want
to
think
of
it
.
He
drove
away
thought
;
thought
*NL*
tortured
him
.
All
he
knew
,
all
he
felt
was
that
everything
must
be
*NL*
changed
``
one
way
or
another
,
''
he
repeated
with
desperate
and
immovable
*NL*
self-confidence
and
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
old
habit
he
took
his
usual
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
Hay
*NL*
Market
.
A
dark-haired
young
man
with
a
barrel
organ
was
standing
in
*NL*
the
road
in
front
of
a
little
general
shop
and
was
grinding
out
a
very
*NL*
sentimental
song
.
He
was
accompanying
a
girl
of
fifteen
,
who
stood
*NL*
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
him
.
She
was
dressed
up
in
a
crinoline
,
a
*NL*
mantle
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
flame-coloured
feather
in
it
,
all
very
*NL*
old
and
shabby
.
In
a
strong
and
rather
agreeable
voice
,
cracked
and
*NL*
coarsened
by
street
singing
,
she
sang
in
hope
of
getting
a
copper
from
*NL*
the
shop
.
Raskolnikov
joined
two
or
three
listeners
,
took
out
a
five
*NL*
copeck
piece
and
put
it
in
the
girl
's
hand
.
She
broke
off
abruptly
on
a
*NL*
sentimental
high
note
,
shouted
sharply
to
the
organ
grinder
``
Come
on
,
''
*NL*
and
both
moved
on
to
the
next
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
street
music
?
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
addressing
a
middle-aged
*NL*
man
standing
idly
by
him
.
The
man
looked
at
him
,
startled
and
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
to
hear
singing
to
a
street
organ
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
and
his
*NL*
manner
seemed
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
the
subject
--
``
I
like
it
*NL*
on
cold
,
dark
,
damp
autumn
evenings
--
they
must
be
damp
--
when
all
the
*NL*
passers-by
have
pale
green
,
sickly
faces
,
or
better
still
when
wet
*NL*
snow
is
falling
straight
down
,
when
there
's
no
wind
--
you
know
what
I
*NL*
mean
?
--
and
the
street
lamps
shine
through
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
...
Excuse
me
...
''
muttered
the
stranger
,
frightened
by
the
*NL*
question
and
Raskolnikov
's
strange
manner
,
and
he
crossed
over
to
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
straight
on
and
came
out
at
the
corner
of
the
Hay
*NL*
Market
,
where
the
huckster
and
his
wife
had
talked
with
Lizaveta
;
but
*NL*
they
were
not
there
now
.
Recognising
the
place
,
he
stopped
,
looked
round
*NL*
and
addressed
a
young
fellow
in
a
red
shirt
who
stood
gaping
before
a
*NL*
corn
chandler
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
there
a
man
who
keeps
a
booth
with
his
wife
at
this
corner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
sorts
of
people
keep
booths
here
,
''
answered
the
young
man
,
glancing
*NL*
superciliously
at
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
he
was
christened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
a
Zaraisky
man
,
too
?
Which
province
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
looked
at
Raskolnikov
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
province
,
your
excellency
,
but
a
district
.
Graciously
*NL*
forgive
me
,
your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
tavern
at
the
top
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
an
eating-house
and
there
's
a
billiard-room
and
you
'll
find
*NL*
princesses
there
too
...
La-la
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
crossed
the
square
.
In
that
corner
there
was
a
dense
crowd
*NL*
of
peasants
.
He
pushed
his
way
into
the
thickest
part
of
it
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
faces
.
He
felt
an
unaccountable
inclination
to
enter
into
*NL*
conversation
with
people
.
But
the
peasants
took
no
notice
of
him
;
they
*NL*
were
all
shouting
in
groups
together
.
He
stood
and
thought
a
little
and
*NL*
took
a
turning
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
often
crossed
that
little
street
which
turns
at
an
angle
,
leading
*NL*
from
the
market-place
to
Sadovy
Street
.
Of
late
he
had
often
felt
drawn
*NL*
to
wander
about
this
district
,
when
he
felt
depressed
,
that
he
might
*NL*
feel
more
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
walked
along
,
thinking
of
nothing
.
At
that
point
there
is
a
great
*NL*
block
of
buildings
,
entirely
let
out
in
dram
shops
and
eating-houses
;
*NL*
women
were
continually
running
in
and
out
,
bare-headed
and
in
their
*NL*
indoor
clothes
.
Here
and
there
they
gathered
in
groups
,
on
the
pavement
,
*NL*
especially
about
the
entrances
to
various
festive
establishments
in
*NL*
the
lower
storeys
.
From
one
of
these
a
loud
din
,
sounds
of
singing
,
the
*NL*
tinkling
of
a
guitar
and
shouts
of
merriment
,
floated
into
the
street
.
*NL*
A
crowd
of
women
were
thronging
round
the
door
;
some
were
sitting
on
the
*NL*
steps
,
others
on
the
pavement
,
others
were
standing
talking
.
A
drunken
*NL*
soldier
,
smoking
a
cigarette
,
was
walking
near
them
in
the
road
,
*NL*
swearing
;
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
his
way
somewhere
,
but
had
*NL*
forgotten
where
.
One
beggar
was
quarrelling
with
another
,
and
a
man
dead
*NL*
drunk
was
lying
right
across
the
road
.
Raskolnikov
joined
the
throng
of
*NL*
women
,
who
were
talking
in
husky
voices
.
They
were
bare-headed
and
wore
*NL*
cotton
dresses
and
goatskin
shoes
.
There
were
women
of
forty
and
some
*NL*
not
more
than
seventeen
;
almost
all
had
blackened
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
strangely
attracted
by
the
singing
and
all
the
noise
and
*NL*
uproar
in
the
saloon
below
...
someone
could
be
heard
within
dancing
*NL*
frantically
,
marking
time
with
his
heels
to
the
sounds
of
the
guitar
*NL*
and
of
a
thin
falsetto
voice
singing
a
jaunty
air
.
He
listened
intently
,
*NL*
gloomily
and
dreamily
,
bending
down
at
the
entrance
and
peeping
*NL*
inquisitively
in
from
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
handsome
soldier
*NL*
Do
n't
beat
me
for
nothing
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
trilled
the
thin
voice
of
the
singer
.
Raskolnikov
felt
a
great
desire
to
*NL*
make
out
what
he
was
singing
,
as
though
everything
depended
on
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go

?
''
he
thought
.
``
They
are
laughing
.
From
drink
.
Shall
I
get
*NL*
drunk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
in
?
''
one
of
the
women
asked
him
.
Her
voice
was
*NL*
still
musical
and
less
thick
than
the
others
,
she
was
young
and
not
*NL*
repulsive
--
the
only
one
of
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
's
pretty
,
''
he
said
,
drawing
himself
up
and
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
,
much
pleased
at
the
compliment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
nice
looking
yourself
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
thin
though
!
''
observed
another
woman
in
a
deep
bass
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
just
come
out
of
a
hospital
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
all
generals
'
daughters
,
it
seems
,
but
they
have
all
snub
*NL*
noses
,
''
interposed
a
tipsy
peasant
with
a
sly
smile
on
his
face
,
wearing
*NL*
a
loose
coat
.
``
See
how
jolly
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
sweetie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
darted
down
into
the
saloon
below
.
Raskolnikov
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
sir
,
''
the
girl
shouted
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
always
be
pleased
to
spend
an
hour
with
you
,
kind
gentleman
,
but
*NL*
now
I
feel
shy
.
Give
me
six
copecks
for
a
drink
,
there
's
a
nice
young
*NL*
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
gave
her
what
came
first
--
fifteen
copecks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
good-natured
gentleman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
for
Duclida
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
too
much
,
''
one
of
the
women
observed
,
shaking
her
head
*NL*
at
Duclida
.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
you
can
ask
like
that
.
I
believe
I
should
*NL*
drop
with
shame
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
curiously
at
the
speaker
.
She
was
a
pock-marked
wench
*NL*
of
thirty
,
covered
with
bruises
,
with
her
upper
lip
swollen
.
She
made
*NL*
her
criticism
quietly
and
earnestly
.
``
Where
is
it
,
''
thought
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
I
've
read
that
someone
condemned
to
death
says
or
thinks
,
*NL*
an
hour
before
his
death
,
that
if
he
had
to
live
on
some
high
rock
,
*NL*
on
such
a
narrow
ledge
that
he
'd
only
room
to
stand
,
and
the
ocean
,
*NL*
everlasting
darkness
,
everlasting
solitude
,
everlasting
tempest
around
*NL*
him
,
if
he
had
to
remain
standing
on
a
square
yard
of
space
all
his
*NL*
life
,
a
thousand
years
,
eternity
,
it
were
better
to
live
so
than
to
die
*NL*
at
once
!
Only
to
live

to
live
and
live
!
Life
,
whatever
it
may
be

...
*NL*
How
true
it
is
!
Good
God
,
how
true
!
Man
is
a
vile
creature
!
...
And
vile
*NL*
is
he
who
calls
him
vile
for
that
,
''
he
added
a
moment
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
into
another
street
.
``
Bah
,
the
Palais
de
Cristal
!
Razumihin
*NL*
was
just
talking
of
the
Palais
de
Cristal
.
But
what
on
earth
was
it
*NL*
I
wanted
?
Yes
,
the
newspapers
...
Zossimov
said
he
'd
read
it
in
the
*NL*
papers
.
Have
you
the
papers
?
''
he
asked
,
going
into
a
very
spacious
and
*NL*
positively
clean
restaurant
,
consisting
of
several
rooms
,
which
were
,
*NL*
however
,
rather
empty
.
Two
or
three
people
were
drinking
tea
,
and
in
a
*NL*
room
further
away
were
sitting
four
men
drinking
champagne
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
fancied
that
Zametov
was
one
of
them
,
but
he
could
not
be
sure
at
that
*NL*
distance
.
``
What
if
it
is
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
vodka
?
''
asked
the
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
some
tea
and
bring
me
the
papers
,
the
old
ones
for
the
last
*NL*
five
days
,
and
I
'll
give
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
here
's
to-day
's
.
No
vodka
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
newspapers
and
the
tea
were
brought
.
Raskolnikov
sat
down
and
*NL*
began
to
look
through
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
damn
...
these
are
the
items
of
intelligence
.
An
accident
on
a
*NL*
staircase
,
spontaneous
combustion
of
a
shopkeeper
from
alcohol
,
a
fire
*NL*
in
Peski
...
a
fire
in
the
Petersburg
quarter
...
another
fire
in
the
*NL*
Petersburg
quarter
...
and
another
fire
in
the
Petersburg
quarter
...
*NL*
Ah
,
here
it
is
!
''
He
found
at
last
what
he
was
seeking
and
began
to
*NL*
read
it
.
The
lines
danced
before
his
eyes
,
but
he
read
it
all
and
began
*NL*
eagerly
seeking
later
additions
in
the
following
numbers
.
His
hands
*NL*
shook
with
nervous
impatience
as
he
turned
the
sheets
.
Suddenly
someone
*NL*
sat
down
beside
him
at
his
table
.
He
looked
up
,
it
was
the
head
clerk
*NL*
Zametov
,
looking
just
the
same
,
with
the
rings
on
his
fingers
and
the
*NL*
watch-chain
,
with
the
curly
,
black
hair
,
parted
and
pomaded
,
with
the
*NL*
smart
waistcoat
,
rather
shabby
coat
and
doubtful
linen
.
He
was
in
a
good
*NL*
humour
,
at
least
he
was
smiling
very
gaily
and
good-humouredly
.
His
dark
*NL*
face
was
rather
flushed
from
the
champagne
he
had
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
here
?
''
he
began
in
surprise
,
speaking
as
though
he
'd
known
*NL*
him
all
his
life
.
``
Why
,
Razumihin
told
me
only
yesterday
you
were
*NL*
unconscious
.
How
strange
!
And
do
you
know
I
've
been
to
see
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
knew
he
would
come
up
to
him
.
He
laid
aside
the
papers
and
*NL*
turned
to
Zametov
.
There
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
,
and
a
new
shade
of
*NL*
irritable
impatience
was
apparent
in
that
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
have
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
've
heard
it
.
You
looked
for
my
*NL*
sock
...
And
you
know
Razumihin
has
lost
his
heart
to
you
?
He
says
*NL*
you
've
been
with
him
to
Luise
Ivanovna
's
--
you
know
,
the
woman
you
tried
*NL*
to
befriend
,
for
whom
you
winked
to
the
Explosive
Lieutenant
and
he
*NL*
would
not
understand
.
Do
you
remember
?
How
could
he
fail
to
*NL*
understand
--
it
was
quite
clear
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
hot
head
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
explosive
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
friend
Razumihin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
a
jolly
life
,
Mr.
Zametov
;
entrance
free
to
the
most
*NL*
agreeable
places

Who
's
been
pouring
champagne
into
you
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
just
been
...
having
a
drink
together
...
You
talk
about
pouring
*NL*
it
into
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
way
of
a
fee
!
You
profit
by
everything
!
''
Raskolnikov
laughed
,
``
it
's
*NL*
all
right
,
my
dear
boy
,
''
he
added
,
slapping
Zametov
on
the
shoulder
.
``
I
*NL*
am
not
speaking
from
temper
,
but
in
a
friendly
way
,
for
sport
,
as
that
*NL*
workman
of
yours
said
when
he
was
scuffling
with
Dmitri
,
in
the
case
of
*NL*
the
old
woman
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
know
more
about
it
than
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
you
are
...
I
am
sure
you
are
still
very
unwell

You
*NL*
ought
n't
to
have
come
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
I
seem
strange
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
What
are
you
doing
,
reading
the
papers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
lot
about
the
fires

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
reading
about
the
fires
.
''
Here
he
looked
mysteriously
at
*NL*
Zametov
;
his
lips
were
twisted
again
in
a
mocking
smile
.
``
No
,
I
am
not
*NL*
reading
about
the
fires
,
''
he
went
on
,
winking
at
Zametov
.
``
But
confess
*NL*
now
,
my
dear
fellow
,
you
're
awfully
anxious
to
know
what
I
am
reading
*NL*
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
in
the
least
.
May
n't
I
ask
a
question
?
Why
do
you
keep
*NL*
on
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
you
are
a
man
of
culture
and
education
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
the
sixth
class
at
the
gymnasium
,
''
said
Zametov
with
some
*NL*
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixth
class
!
Ah
,
my
cock-sparrow
!
With
your
parting
and
your
rings
--
you
*NL*
are
a
gentleman
of
fortune
.
Foo
!
what
a
charming
boy
!
''
Here
Raskolnikov
*NL*
broke
into
a
nervous
laugh
right
in
Zametov
's
face
.
The
latter
drew
*NL*
back
,
more
amazed
than
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foo
!
how
strange
you
are
!
''
Zametov
repeated
very
seriously
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
thinking
you
are
still
delirious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delirious
?
You
are
fibbing
,
my
cock-sparrow

So
I
am
strange

You

find
me
curious
,
do
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
curious

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
was
reading
about

what
I
was
looking
for
?
See
*NL*
what
a
lot
of
papers
I
've
made
them
bring
me
.
Suspicious
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
prick
up
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
--

prick
up
my
ears

?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
explain
that
afterwards
,

now

my
boy

I
declare
to
you

no

*NL*
better
'
I
confess
'
...
No
,
that
's
not
right
either
;

I
make
a
deposition
*NL*
and
you
take
it
.

I
depose
that
I
was
reading
,
that
I
was
looking
and
*NL*
searching
...
''
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
paused
.
``
I
was
searching
--
and
*NL*
came
here
on
purpose
to
do
it
--
for
news
of
the
murder
of
the
old
*NL*
pawnbroker
woman
,
''
he
articulated
at
last
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
bringing
*NL*
his
face
exceedingly
close
to
the
face
of
Zametov
.
Zametov
looked
at
him
*NL*
steadily
,
without
moving
or
drawing
his
face
away
.
What
struck
Zametov
*NL*
afterwards
as
the
strangest
part
of
it
all
was
that
silence
followed
for
*NL*
exactly
a
minute
,
and
that
they
gazed
at
one
another
all
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
you
have
been
reading
about
it
?
''
he
cried
at
last
,
perplexed
*NL*
and
impatient
.
``
That
's
no
business
of
mine
!
What
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
old
woman
,
''
Raskolnikov
went
on
in
the
same
whisper
,
not
*NL*
heeding
Zametov
's
explanation
,
``
about
whom
you
were
talking
in
the
*NL*
police-office
,
you
remember
,
when
I
fainted
.
Well
,
do
you
understand
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Understand
...
what
?
''
Zametov
brought
out
,
almost
*NL*
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
set
and
earnest
face
was
suddenly
transformed
,
and
he
*NL*
suddenly
went
off
into
the
same
nervous
laugh
as
before
,
as
though
*NL*
utterly
unable
to
restrain
himself
.
And
in
one
flash
he
recalled
with
*NL*
extraordinary
vividness
of
sensation
a
moment
in
the
recent
past
,
that
*NL*
moment
when
he
stood
with
the
axe
behind
the
door
,
while
the
latch
*NL*
trembled
and
the
men
outside
swore
and
shook
it
,
and
he
had
a
sudden
*NL*
desire
to
shout
at
them
,
to
swear
at
them
,
to
put
out
his
tongue
at
*NL*
them
,
to
mock
them
,
to
laugh
,
and
laugh
,
and
laugh
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
either
mad
,
or
...
''
began
Zametov
,
and
he
broke
off
,
as
though
*NL*
stunned
by
the
idea
that
had
suddenly
flashed
into
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
?
Or
what
?
What
?
Come
,
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Zametov
,
getting
angry
,
``
it
's
all
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
silent
.
After
his
sudden
fit
of
laughter
Raskolnikov
became
*NL*
suddenly
thoughtful
and
melancholy
.
He
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
*NL*
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
.
He
seemed
to
have
completely
forgotten
*NL*
Zametov
.
The
silence
lasted
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
drink
your
tea
?
It
's
getting
cold
,
''
said
Zametov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Tea
?
Oh
,
yes
...
''
Raskolnikov
sipped
the
glass
,
put
a
morsel
of
*NL*
bread
in
his
mouth
and
,
suddenly
looking
at
Zametov
,
seemed
to
remember
*NL*
everything
and
pulled
himself
together
.
At
the
same
moment
his
face
*NL*
resumed
its
original
mocking
expression
.
He
went
on
drinking
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
have
been
a
great
many
of
these
crimes
lately
,
''
said
Zametov
.
*NL*
``
Only
the
other
day
I
read
in
the
_
Moscow
News
_
that
a
whole
gang
of
*NL*
false
coiners
had
been
caught
in
Moscow
.
It
was
a
regular
society
.
They
*NL*
used
to
forge
tickets
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago
!
I
read
about
it
a
month
ago

*NL*
Raskolnikov
answered
calmly
.
``
So
you
consider
them
criminals
?
''
he
added
,
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
are
criminals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
?
They
are
children
,
simpletons
,
not
criminals
!
Why
,
half
a
hundred
*NL*
people
meeting
for
such
an
object
--
what
an
idea
!
Three
would
be
too
*NL*
many
,
and
then
they
want
to
have
more
faith
in
one
another
than
in
*NL*
themselves
!
One
has
only
to
blab
in
his
cups
and
it
all
collapses
.
*NL*
Simpletons
!
They
engaged
untrustworthy
people
to
change
the
notes
--
what
*NL*
a
thing
to
trust
to
a
casual
stranger
!
Well
,
let
us
suppose
that
these
*NL*
simpletons
succeed
and
each
makes
a
million
,
and
what
follows
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
their
lives
?
Each
is
dependent
on
the
others
for
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
life
!
Better
hang
oneself
at
once
!
And
they
did
not
know
how
to
change
*NL*
the
notes
either
;
the
man
who
changed
the
notes
took
five
thousand
*NL*
roubles
,
and
his
hands
trembled
.
He
counted
the
first
four
thousand
,
*NL*
but
did
not
count
the
fifth
thousand
--
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
the
*NL*
money
into
his
pocket
and
run
away
.
Of
course
he
roused
suspicion
.
And
*NL*
the
whole
thing
came
to
a
crash
through
one
fool
!
Is
it
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
his
hands
trembled
?
''
observed
Zametov
,
``
yes
,
that
's
quite
*NL*
possible
.
That
,
I
feel
quite
sure
,
is
possible
.
Sometimes
one
ca
n't
*NL*
stand
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
stand
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
could
you
stand
it
then
?
No
,
I
could
n't
.
For
the
sake
of
a
hundred
*NL*
roubles
to
face
such
a
terrible
experience
?
To
go
with
false
notes
*NL*
into
a
bank
where
it
's
their
business
to
spot
that
sort
of
thing
!
No
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
the
face
to
do
it
.
Would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
an
intense
desire
again
``
to
put
his
tongue
out
.
''
Shivers
*NL*
kept
running
down
his
spine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
do
it
quite
differently
,
''
Raskolnikov
began
.
``
This
is
how
I
*NL*
would
change
the
notes
:
I
'd
count
the
first
thousand
three
or
four
times
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
,
looking
at
every
note
and
then
I
'd
set
to
the
*NL*
second
thousand
;
I
'd
count
that
half-way
through
and
then
hold
some
*NL*
fifty-rouble
note
to
the
light
,
then
turn
it
,
then
hold
it
to
the
light
*NL*
again
--
to
see
whether
it
was
a
good
one
.
'
I
am
afraid
,
'
I
would
say
,
'
a
*NL*
relation
of
mine
lost
twenty-five
roubles
the
other
day
through
a
*NL*
false
note
,
'
and
then
I
'd
tell
them
the
whole
story
.
And
after
I
began
*NL*
counting
the
third
,
`
No
,
excuse
me
,
'
I
would
say
,
'
I
fancy
I
made
a
*NL*
mistake
in
the
seventh
hundred
in
that
second
thousand
,
I
am
not
sure
.
'
*NL*
And
so
I
would
give
up
the
third
thousand
and
go
back
to
the
second
and
*NL*
so
on
to
the
end
.
And
when
I
had
finished
,
I
'd
pick
out
one
from
the
*NL*
fifth
and
one
from
the
second
thousand
and
take
them
again
to
the
light
*NL*
and
ask
again
,
`
Change
them
,
please
,
'
and
put
the
clerk
into
such
a
stew
*NL*
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
me
.
When
I
'd
finished
and
had
*NL*
gone
out
,
I
'd
come
back
,
`
No
,
excuse
me
,
'
and
ask
for
some
explanation
.
*NL*
That
's
how
I
'd
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foo
!
what
terrible
things
you
say
!
''
said
Zametov
,
laughing
.
``
But
all
*NL*
that
is
only
talk
.
I
dare
say
when
it
came
to
deeds
you
'd
make
a
slip
.
*NL*
I
believe
that
even
a
practised
,
desperate
man
can
not
always
reckon
on
*NL*
himself
,
much
less
you
and
I.
To
take
an
example
near
home
--
that
old
*NL*
woman
murdered
in
our
district
.
The
murderer
seems
to
have
been
a
*NL*
desperate
fellow
,
he
risked
everything
in
open
daylight
,
was
saved
by
*NL*
a
miracle
--
but
his
hands
shook
,
too
.
He
did
not
succeed
in
robbing
the
*NL*
place
,
he
could
n't
stand
it
.
That
was
clear
from
the
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
seemed
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clear
?
Why
do
n't
you
catch
him
then
?
''
he
cried
,
maliciously
gibing
at
*NL*
Zametov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
will
catch
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
You
?
Do
you
suppose
you
could
catch
him
?
You
've
a
tough
job
!
A
*NL*
great
point
for
you
is
whether
a
man
is
spending
money
or
not
.
If
he
had
*NL*
no
money
and
suddenly
begins
spending
,
he
must
be
the
man
.
So
that
any
*NL*
child
can
mislead
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
they
always
do
that
,
though
,
''
answered
Zametov
.
``
A
man
will
*NL*
commit
a
clever
murder
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
then
at
once
he
goes
*NL*
drinking
in
a
tavern
.
They
are
caught
spending
money
,
they
are
not
all
*NL*
as
cunning
as
you
are
.
You
would
n't
go
to
a
tavern
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
frowned
and
looked
steadily
at
Zametov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
enjoy
the
subject
and
would
like
to
know
how
I
should
*NL*
behave
in
that
case
,
too
?
''
he
asked
with
displeasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
,
''
Zametov
answered
firmly
and
seriously
.
Somewhat
too
*NL*
much
earnestness
began
to
appear
in
his
words
and
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
then
.
This
is
how
I
should
behave

''
Raskolnikov
began
,
again
*NL*
bringing
his
face
close
to
Zametov
's
,
again
staring
at
him
and
speaking
*NL*
in
a
whisper
,
so
that
the
latter
positively
shuddered
.
``
This
is
what
*NL*
I
should
have
done
.
I
should
have
taken
the
money
and
jewels
,
I
should
*NL*
have
walked
out
of
there
and
have
gone
straight
to
some
deserted
place
*NL*
with
fences
round
it
and
scarcely
anyone
to
be
seen
,
some
kitchen
garden
*NL*
or
place
of
that
sort
.
I
should
have
looked
out
beforehand
some
stone
*NL*
weighing
a
hundredweight
or
more
which
had
been
lying
in
the
corner
from
*NL*
the
time
the
house
was
built
.
I
would
lift
that
stone
--
there
would
sure
*NL*
to
be
a
hollow
under
it
,
and
I
would
put
the
jewels
and
money
in
that
*NL*
hole
.
Then
I
'd
roll
the
stone
back
so
that
it
would
look
as
before
,
*NL*
would
press
it
down
with
my
foot
and
walk
away
.
And
for
a
year
or
two
,
*NL*
three
maybe
,
I
would
not
touch
it
.
And
,
well
,
they
could
search
!
There
'd
*NL*
be
no
trace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
madman
,
''
said
Zametov
,
and
for
some
reason
he
too
spoke
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
and
moved
away
from
Raskolnikov
,
whose
eyes
were
glittering
.
He
*NL*
had
turned
fearfully
pale
and
his
upper
lip
was
twitching
and
quivering
.
*NL*
He
bent
down
as
close
as
possible
to
Zametov
,
and
his
lips
began
to
move
*NL*
without
uttering
a
word
.
This
lasted
for
half
a
minute
;
he
knew
what
he
*NL*
was
doing
,
but
could
not
restrain
himself
.
The
terrible
word
trembled
on
*NL*
his
lips
,
like
the
latch
on
that
door
;
in
another
moment
it
will
break
*NL*
out
,
in
another
moment
he
will
let
it
go
,
he
will
speak
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
it
was
I
who
murdered
the
old
woman
and
Lizaveta
?
''
he
said
*NL*
suddenly
and
--
realised
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zametov
looked
wildly
at
him
and
turned
white
as
the
tablecloth
.
His
*NL*
face
wore
a
contorted
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
possible
?
''
he
brought
out
faintly
.
Raskolnikov
looked
*NL*
wrathfully
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Own
up
that
you
believed
it
,
yes
,
you
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
I
believe
it
less
than
ever
now
,
''
Zametov
cried
*NL*
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
caught
my
cock-sparrow
!
So
you
did
believe
it
before
,
if
now
you
*NL*
believe
less
than
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

''
cried
Zametov
,
obviously
embarrassed
.
``
Have
you
been
*NL*
frightening
me
so
as
to
lead
up
to
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
believe
it
then

What
were
you
talking
about
behind
my
*NL*
back
when
I
went
out
of
the
police-office
?
And
why
did
the
explosive
*NL*
lieutenant
question
me
after
I
fainted
?
Hey
,
there
,
''
he
shouted
to
the
*NL*
waiter
,
getting
up
and
taking
his
cap
,
``
how
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty
copecks
,
''
the
latter
replied
,
running
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
twenty
copecks
for
vodka
.
See
what
a
lot
of
money
!
''
he
*NL*
held
out
his
shaking
hand
to
Zametov
with
notes
in
it
.
``
Red
notes
and
*NL*
blue
,
twenty-five
roubles

Where
did
I
get
them
?
And
where
did

new
*NL*
clothes
come
from
?
You
know
I
had
not
a
copeck
.
You
've
cross-examined
my
*NL*
landlady
,
I
'll
be
bound
...
Well
,
that
's
enough
!
_
Assez
cause
!
_
Till
we
*NL*
meet
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
,
trembling
all
over
from
a
sort
of
wild
hysterical
*NL*
sensation
,
in
which
there
was
an
element
of
insufferable
rapture
.
Yet
he
*NL*
was
gloomy
and
terribly
tired
.
His
face
was
twisted
as
after
a
fit
.
*NL*
His
fatigue
increased
rapidly
.
Any
shock
,
any
irritating
sensation
*NL*
stimulated
and
revived
his
energies
at
once
,
but
his
strength
failed
as
*NL*
quickly
when
the
stimulus
was
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zametov
,
left
alone
,
sat
for
a
long
time
in
the
same
place
,
plunged
in
*NL*
thought
.
Raskolnikov
had
unwittingly
worked
a
revolution
in
his
brain
on
*NL*
a
certain
point
and
had
made
up
his
mind
for
him
conclusively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ilya
Petrovitch
is
a
blockhead
,
''
he
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
hardly
opened
the
door
of
the
restaurant
when
he
*NL*
stumbled
against
Razumihin
on
the
steps
.
They
did
not
see
each
other
*NL*
till
they
almost
knocked
against
each
other
.
For
a
moment
they
stood
*NL*
looking
each
other
up
and
down
.
Razumihin
was
greatly
astounded
,
then
*NL*
anger
,
real
anger
gleamed
fiercely
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
here
you
are
!
''
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
--
``
you
ran
away
*NL*
from
your
bed
!
And
here
I
've
been
looking
for
you
under
the
sofa
!
We
*NL*
went
up
to
the
garret
.
I
almost
beat
Nastasya
on
your
account
.
And
here
*NL*
he
is
after
all
.
Rodya
!
What
is
the
meaning
of
it
?
Tell
me
the
whole
*NL*
truth
!
Confess
!
Do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
that
I
'm
sick
to
death
of
you
all
and
I
want
to
be
alone

''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
answered
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
?
When
you
are
not
able
to
walk
,
when
your
face
is
as
white
as
a
*NL*
sheet
and
you
are
gasping
for
breath
!
Idiot
!
...
What
have
you
been
doing
*NL*
in
the
Palais
de
Cristal
?
Own
up
at
once

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
!
''
said
Raskolnikov
and
tried
to
pass
him
.
This
was
too
much
*NL*
for
Razumihin
;
he
gripped
him
firmly
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
you
go

You
dare
tell
me
to
let

go

Do
you
know
what
I
'll

with
you
directly
?
I
'll
pick
you
up

tie
you
up
in
a
bundle

carry
you
*NL*
home
under
my
arm
and
lock
you
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Razumihin
,
''
Raskolnikov
began
quietly
,
apparently
calm
--
``
ca
n't
*NL*
you
see
that
I
do
n't
want
your
benevolence

A
strange
desire
you
have
to
*NL*
shower
benefits
on
a
man
who
...
curses
them
,
who
feels
them
a
burden
in
*NL*
fact
!
Why
did
you
seek
me
out
at
the
beginning
of
my
illness
?
Maybe
I
*NL*
was
very
glad
to
die
.
Did
n't
I
tell
you
plainly
enough
to-day
that
*NL*
you
were
torturing
me
,
that
I
was
...
sick
of
you

You
seem
to
want
to
*NL*
torture
people
!
I
assure
you
that
all
that
is
seriously
hindering
my
*NL*
recovery
,
because
it
's
continually
irritating
me
.
You
saw
Zossimov
*NL*
went
away
just
now
to
avoid
irritating
me
.
You
leave
me
alone
too
,
for
*NL*
goodness

sake

What
right
have
you

indeed

to
keep
me
by
force

Do
n't

you
see
that
I
am
in
possession

all
my
faculties
now

How

how
can
*NL*
I
persuade
you
not
to
persecute
me
with
your
kindness

I
may
be

ungrateful

Let

*NL*
*NL*
He
began
calmly
,
gloating
beforehand
over
the
venomous
phrases
he
was
*NL*
about
to
utter
,
but
finished
,
panting
for
breath
,
in
a
frenzy
,
as
he
had
*NL*
been
with
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
stood
a
moment
,
thought
and
let
his
hand
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

go
to
hell

he
said
gently
and
thoughtfully
.
``
Stay
,
''
he
*NL*
roared
,
as
Raskolnikov
was
about
to
move
.
``
Listen
to
me
.
Let
me
tell
*NL*
you
,
that
you
are
all
a
set
of
babbling
,
posing
idiots
!
If
you
've
any
*NL*
little
trouble
you
brood
over
it
like
a
hen
over
an
egg
.
And
you
are
*NL*
plagiarists
even
in
that
!
There
is
n't
a
sign
of
independent
life
in
*NL*
you
!
You
are
made
of
spermaceti
ointment
and
you
've
lymph
in
your
veins
*NL*
instead
of
blood
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
anyone
of
you
!
In
any
circumstances
*NL*
the
first
thing
for
all
of
you
is
to
be
unlike
a
human
being
!
Stop
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
with
redoubled
fury
,
noticing
that
Raskolnikov
was
again
making
*NL*
a
movement
--
``
hear
me
out
!
You
know
I
'm
having
a
house-warming
this
*NL*
evening
,
I
dare
say
they
've
arrived
by
now
,
but
I
left
my
uncle
there
--
I
*NL*
just
ran
in
--
to
receive
the
guests
.
And
if
you
were
n't
a
fool
,
a
common
*NL*
fool
,
a
perfect
fool
,
if
you
were
an
original
instead
of
a
translation
...
*NL*
you
see
,
Rodya
,
I
recognise
you
're
a
clever
fellow
,
but
you
're
a
*NL*
fool
!
--
and
if
you
were
n't
a
fool
you
'd
come
round
to
me
this
evening
*NL*
instead
of
wearing
out
your
boots
in
the
street
!
Since
you
have
gone
*NL*
out
,
there
's
no
help
for
it
!
I
'd
give
you
a
snug
easy
chair
,
my
landlady
*NL*
has
one
...
a
cup
of
tea
,
company
...
Or
you
could
lie
on
the
sofa
--
any
*NL*
way
you
would
be
with
us
...
Zossimov
will
be
there
too
.
Will
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
R-rubbish
!
''
Razumihin
shouted
,
out
of
patience
.
``
How
do
you
know
?
*NL*
You
ca
n't
answer
for
yourself
!
You
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
...
*NL*
Thousands
of
times
I
've
fought
tooth
and
nail
with
people
and
run
back
*NL*
to
them
afterwards
...
One
feels
ashamed
and
goes
back
to
a
man
!
So
*NL*
remember
,
Potchinkov
's
house
on
the
third
storey
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
Razumihin
,
I
do
believe
you
'd
let
anybody
beat
you
from
sheer
*NL*
benevolence

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
?
Whom
?
Me
?
I
'd
twist
his
nose
off
at
the
mere
idea

47
,
Babushkin
's
flat

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
come

Razumihin
.
''
Raskolnikov
turned
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
you
will
,
''
Razumihin
shouted
after
him
.
``
I
refuse
to
know
you

is
Zametov

there

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

``
Did

*NL*
``

about

Confound
you

do

me
then

Potchinkov
's
house
,
47
,
*NL*
Babushkin
's
flat
,
remember
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
on
and
turned
the
corner
into
Sadovy
Street
.
*NL*
Razumihin
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
.
Then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
*NL*
went
into
the
house
but
stopped
short
of
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
it
,
''
he
went
on
almost
aloud
.
``
He
talked
sensibly
but
yet
...
*NL*
I
am
a
fool
!
As
if
madmen
did
n't
talk
sensibly
!
And
this
was
just
what
*NL*
Zossimov
seemed
afraid
of
.
''
He
struck
his
finger
on
his
forehead
.
``
What
*NL*
if
...
how
could
I
let
him
go
off
alone
?
He
may
drown
himself
...
Ach
,
*NL*
what
a
blunder
!
I
ca
n't
.
''
And
he
ran
back
to
overtake
Raskolnikov
,
but
*NL*
there
was
no
trace
of
him
.
With
a
curse
he
returned
with
rapid
steps
to
*NL*
the
Palais
de
Cristal
to
question
Zametov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
straight
to
X
--
Bridge
,
stood
in
the
middle
,
and
*NL*
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
rail
stared
into
the
distance
.
On
parting
*NL*
with
Razumihin
,
he
felt
so
much
weaker
that
he
could
scarcely
reach
this
*NL*
place
.
He
longed
to
sit
or
lie
down
somewhere
in
the
street
.
Bending
*NL*
over
the
water
,
he
gazed
mechanically
at
the
last
pink
flush
of
the
*NL*
sunset
,
at
the
row
of
houses
growing
dark
in
the
gathering
twilight
,
at
*NL*
one
distant
attic
window
on
the
left
bank
,
flashing
as
though
on
fire
in
*NL*
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
,
at
the
darkening
water
of
the
canal
,
*NL*
and
the
water
seemed
to
catch
his
attention
.
At
last
red
circles
flashed
*NL*
before
his
eyes
,
the
houses
seemed
moving
,
the
passers-by
,
the
canal
*NL*
banks
,
the
carriages
,
all
danced
before
his
eyes
.
Suddenly
he
started
,
*NL*
saved
again
perhaps
from
swooning
by
an
uncanny
and
hideous
sight
.
He
*NL*
became
aware
of
someone
standing
on
the
right
side
of
him
;
he
looked
*NL*
and
saw
a
tall
woman
with
a
kerchief
on
her
head
,
with
a
long
,
yellow
,
*NL*
wasted
face
and
red
sunken
eyes
.
She
was
looking
straight
at
him
,
but
*NL*
obviously
she
saw
nothing
and
recognised
no
one
.
Suddenly
she
leaned
her
*NL*
right
hand
on
the
parapet
,
lifted
her
right
leg
over
the
railing
,
then
*NL*
her
left
and
threw
herself
into
the
canal
.
The
filthy
water
parted
and
*NL*
swallowed
up
its
victim
for
a
moment
,
but
an
instant
later
the
drowning
*NL*
woman
floated
to
the
surface
,
moving
slowly
with
the
current
,
her
head
*NL*
and
legs
in
the
water
,
her
skirt
inflated
like
a
balloon
over
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
drowning
!
A
woman
drowning
!
''
shouted
dozens
of
voices
;
people
*NL*
ran
up
,
both
banks
were
thronged
with
spectators
,
on
the
bridge
people
*NL*
crowded
about
Raskolnikov
,
pressing
up
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
it
!
it
's
our
Afrosinya
!
''
a
woman
cried
tearfully
close
by
.
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
save
her
!
kind
people
,
pull
her
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
boat
,
a
boat
''
was
shouted
in
the
crowd
.
But
there
was
no
need
of
a
*NL*
boat
;
a
policeman
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
canal
,
threw
off
his
great
*NL*
coat
and
his
boots
and
rushed
into
the
water
.
It
was
easy
to
reach
her
:
*NL*
she
floated
within
a
couple
of
yards
from
the
steps
,
he
caught
hold
of
*NL*
her
clothes
with
his
right
hand
and
with
his
left
seized
a
pole
which
a
*NL*
comrade
held
out
to
him
;
the
drowning
woman
was
pulled
out
at
once
.
They
*NL*
laid
her
on
the
granite
pavement
of
the
embankment
.
She
soon
recovered
*NL*
consciousness
,
raised
her
head
,
sat
up
and
began
sneezing
and
coughing
,
*NL*
stupidly
wiping
her
wet
dress
with
her
hands
.
She
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
drunk
herself
out
of
her
senses
,
''
the
same
woman
's
voice
wailed
*NL*
at
her
side
.
``
Out
of
her
senses
.
The
other
day
she
tried
to
hang
*NL*
herself
,
we
cut
her
down
.
I
ran
out
to
the
shop
just
now
,
left
my
little
*NL*
girl
to
look
after
her
--
and
here
she
's
in
trouble
again
!
A
neighbour
,
*NL*
gentleman
,
a
neighbour
,
we
live
close
by
,
the
second
house
from
the
end
,
*NL*
see
yonder
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
broke
up
.
The
police
still
remained
round
the
woman
,
someone
*NL*
mentioned
the
police
station
...
Raskolnikov
looked
on
with
a
strange
*NL*
sensation
of
indifference
and
apathy
.
He
felt
disgusted
.
``
No
,
that
's
*NL*
loathsome
...
water
...
it
's
not
good
enough
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
will
come
of
it
,
''
he
added
,
``
no
use
to
wait
.
What
about
the
*NL*
police
office
...
?
And
why
is
n't
Zametov
at
the
police
office
?
The
police
*NL*
office
is
open
till
ten
o'clock
...
''
He
turned
his
back
to
the
railing
*NL*
and
looked
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
!
''
he
said
resolutely
;
he
moved
from
the
bridge
and
*NL*
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
police
office
.
His
heart
felt
hollow
and
*NL*
empty
.
He
did
not
want
to
think
.
Even
his
depression
had
passed
,
there
*NL*
was
not
a
trace
now
of
the
energy
with
which
he
had
set
out
``
to
make
an
*NL*
end
of
it
all
.
''
Complete
apathy
had
succeeded
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
a
way
out
of
it
,
''
he
thought
,
walking
slowly
and
listlessly
*NL*
along
the
canal
bank
.
``
Anyway
I
'll
make
an
end
,
for
I
want
to
...
But
*NL*
is
it
a
way
out
?
What
does
it
matter
!
There
'll
be
the
square
yard
of
*NL*
space
--
ha
!
But
what
an
end
!
Is
it
really
the
end
?
Shall
I
tell
them
or
*NL*
not
?
Ah
...
damn
!
How
tired
I
am
!
If
I
could
find
somewhere
to
sit
or
lie
*NL*
down
soon
!
What
I
am
most
ashamed
of
is
its
being
so
stupid
.
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
about
that
either
!
What
idiotic
ideas
come
into
one
's
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
reach
the
police
office
he
had
to
go
straight
forward
and
take
the
*NL*
second
turning
to
the
left
.
It
was
only
a
few
paces
away
.
But
at
the
*NL*
first
turning
he
stopped
and
,
after
a
minute
's
thought
,
turned
into
a
*NL*
side
street
and
went
two
streets
out
of
his
way
,
possibly
without
any
*NL*
object
,
or
possibly
to
delay
a
minute
and
gain
time
.
He
walked
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
ground
;
suddenly
someone
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
;
he
lifted
*NL*
his
head
and
saw
that
he
was
standing
at
the
very
gate
of
_
the
_
house
.
*NL*
He
had
not
passed
it
,
he
had
not
been
near
it
since
_
that
_
evening
.
*NL*
An
overwhelming
,
unaccountable
prompting
drew
him
on
.
He
went
into
the
*NL*
house
,
passed
through
the
gateway
,
then
into
the
first
entrance
on
the
*NL*
right
,
and
began
mounting
the
familiar
staircase
to
the
fourth
storey
.
*NL*
The
narrow
,
steep
staircase
was
very
dark
.
He
stopped
at
each
landing
*NL*
and
looked
round
him
with
curiosity
;
on
the
first
landing
the
framework
*NL*
of
the
window
had
been
taken
out
.
``
That
was
n't
so
then
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
Here
was
the
flat
on
the
second
storey
where
Nikolay
and
Dmitri
had
been
*NL*
working
.
``
It
's
shut
up
and
the
door
newly
painted
.
So
it
's
to
let
.
''
Then
*NL*
the
third
storey
and
the
fourth
.
``
Here
!
''
He
was
perplexed
to
find
the
*NL*
door
of
the
flat
wide
open
.
There
were
men
there
,
he
could
hear
voices
;
*NL*
he
had
not
expected
that
.
After
brief
hesitation
he
mounted
the
last
*NL*
stairs
and
went
into
the
flat
.
It
,
too
,
was
being
done
up
;
there
were
*NL*
workmen
in
it
.
This
seemed
to
amaze
him
;
he
somehow
fancied
that
he
*NL*
would
find
everything
as
he
left
it
,
even
perhaps
the
corpses
in
the
*NL*
same
places
on
the
floor
.
And
now
,
bare
walls
,
no
furniture
;
it
seemed
*NL*
strange
.
He
walked
to
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
window-sill
.
There
*NL*
were
two
workmen
,
both
young
fellows
,
but
one
much
younger
than
the
*NL*
other
.
They
were
papering
the
walls
with
a
new
white
paper
covered
with
*NL*
lilac
flowers
,
instead
of
the
old
,
dirty
,
yellow
one
.
Raskolnikov
for
*NL*
some
reason
felt
horribly
annoyed
by
this
.
He
looked
at
the
new
paper
*NL*
with
dislike
,
as
though
he
felt
sorry
to
have
it
all
so
changed
.
*NL*
The
workmen
had
obviously
stayed
beyond
their
time
and
now
they
were
*NL*
hurriedly
rolling
up
their
paper
and
getting
ready
to
go
home
.
They
took
*NL*
no
notice
of
Raskolnikov
's
coming
in
;
they
were
talking
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
folded
his
arms
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
comes
to
me
in
the
morning
,
''
said
the
elder
to
the
younger
,
``
very
*NL*
early
,
all
dressed
up
.
`
Why
are
you
preening
and
prinking
?
'
says
I.
'
I
*NL*
am
ready
to
do
anything
to
please
you
,
Tit
Vassilitch
!
'
That
's
a
way
of
*NL*
going
on
!
And
she
dressed
up
like
a
regular
fashion
book
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
a
fashion
book
?
''
the
younger
one
asked
.
He
obviously
*NL*
regarded
the
other
as
an
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fashion
book
is
a
lot
of
pictures
,
coloured
,
and
they
come
to
the
*NL*
tailors
here
every
Saturday
,
by
post
from
abroad
,
to
show
folks
how
*NL*
to
dress
,
the
male
sex
as
well
as
the
female
.
They
're
pictures
.
The
*NL*
gentlemen
are
generally
wearing
fur
coats
and
for
the
ladies
'
fluffles
,
*NL*
they
're
beyond
anything
you
can
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
you
ca
n't
find
in
Petersburg
,
''
the
younger
cried
*NL*
enthusiastically
,
``
except
father
and
mother
,
there
's
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
them
,
there
's
everything
to
be
found
,
my
boy
,
''
the
elder
*NL*
declared
sententiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
got
up
and
walked
into
the
other
room
where
the
strong
box
,
*NL*
the
bed
,
and
the
chest
of
drawers
had
been
;
the
room
seemed
to
him
very
*NL*
tiny
without
furniture
in
it
.
The
paper
was
the
same
;
the
paper
in
the
*NL*
corner
showed
where
the
case
of
ikons
had
stood
.
He
looked
at
it
and
*NL*
went
to
the
window
.
The
elder
workman
looked
at
him
askance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
answering
Raskolnikov
went
into
the
passage
and
pulled
the
*NL*
bell
.
The
same
bell
,
the
same
cracked
note
.
He
rang
it
a
second
and
*NL*
a
third
time
;
he
listened
and
remembered
.
The
hideous
and
agonisingly
*NL*
fearful
sensation
he
had
felt
then
began
to
come
back
more
and
more
*NL*
vividly
.
He
shuddered
at
every
ring
and
it
gave
him
more
and
more
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
want
?
Who
are
you
?
''
the
workman
shouted
,
going
out
to
*NL*
him
.
Raskolnikov
went
inside
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
take
a
flat
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
looking
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
time
to
look
at
rooms
at
night
!
and
you
ought
to
come
up
*NL*
with
the
porter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
floors
have
been
washed
,
will
they
be
painted
?
''
Raskolnikov
went
*NL*
on
.
``
Is
there
no
blood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
blood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
old
woman
and
her
sister
were
murdered
here
.
There
was
a
*NL*
perfect
pool
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
are
you
?
''
the
workman
cried
,
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
know
?
Come
to
the
police
station
,
I
'll
tell
you

*NL*
*NL*
The
workmen
looked
at
him
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
for
us
to
go
,
we
are
late
.
Come
along

We
must
lock
*NL*
up

''
said
the
elder
workman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
come
along
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
indifferently
,
and
going
*NL*
out
first
,
he
went
slowly
downstairs
.
``
Hey
,
porter
,
''
he
cried
in
the
*NL*
gateway
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
entrance
several
people
were
standing
,
staring
at
the
passers-by
;
*NL*
the
two
porters
,
a
peasant
woman
,
a
man
in
a
long
coat
and
a
few
others
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
straight
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
asked
one
of
the
porters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
the
police
office

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
just
been
there

What
do
you
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
open

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
assistant
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
there
for
a
time
.
What
do
you
want

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
made
no
reply
,
but
stood
beside
them
lost
in
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
to
look
at
the
flat
,
''
said
the
elder
workman
,
coming
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
flat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
we
are
at
work
.
`
Why
have
you
washed
away
the
blood
?

says
he
.
*NL*
`
There
has
been
a
murder
here
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
I
've
come
to
take
it
.
'
*NL*
And
he
began
ringing
at
the
bell
,
all
but
broke
it
.
`
Come
to
the
police
*NL*
station
,
'
says
he
.
`
I
'll
tell
you
everything
there
.
'
He
would
n't
leave
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
looked
at
Raskolnikov
,
frowning
and
perplexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
he
shouted
as
impressively
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Rodion
Romanovitch
Raskolnikov
,
formerly
a
student

I
live
in

house

not
far
from
here
,
flat
Number
14
,
ask
the
porter
,
he
*NL*
knows
me
.
''
Raskolnikov
said
all
this
in
a
lazy
,
dreamy
voice
,
not
*NL*
turning
round
,
but
looking
intently
into
the
darkening
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
been
to
the
flat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
look

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
to
look
at
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
him
straight
to
the
police
station
,
''
the
man
in
the
long
coat
*NL*
jerked
in
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
intently
at
him
over
his
shoulder
and
said
in
the
*NL*
same
slow
,
lazy
tones
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
take
him
,
''
the
man
went
on
more
confidently
.
``
Why
was
he
going
*NL*
into
_
that
_
,
what
's
in
his
mind
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
drunk
,
but
God
knows
what
's
the
matter
with
him
,
''
muttered
the
*NL*
workman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
want
?
''
the
porter
shouted
again
,
beginning
to
get
angry
*NL*
in
earnest
--
``
Why
are
you
hanging
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
funk
the
police
station
then
?
''
said
Raskolnikov
jeeringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
funk
it
?
Why
are
you
hanging
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
rogue
!
''
shouted
the
peasant
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
waste
time
talking
to
him
?
''
cried
the
other
porter
,
a
huge
peasant
*NL*
in
a
full
open
coat
and
with
keys
on
his
belt
.
``
Get
along
!
He
is
a
rogue
*NL*
and
no
mistake
.
Get
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
seizing
Raskolnikov
by
the
shoulder
he
flung
him
into
the
street
.
He
*NL*
lurched
forward
,
but
recovered
his
footing
,
looked
at
the
spectators
in
*NL*
silence
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
man
!
''
observed
the
workman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
strange
folks
about
nowadays
,
''
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
taken
him
to
the
police
station
all
the
same
,
''
said
the
*NL*
man
in
the
long
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
''
decided
the
big
porter
.
``
A
regular
*NL*
rogue
!
Just
what
he
wants
,
you
may
be
sure
,
but
once
take
him
up
,
you
*NL*
wo
n't
get
rid
of
him
...
We
know
the
sort
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
there
or
not
?
''
thought
Raskolnikov
,
standing
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
thoroughfare
at
the
cross-roads
,
and
he
looked
about
him
,
as
*NL*
though
expecting
from
someone
a
decisive
word
.
But
no
sound
came
,
all
*NL*
was
dead
and
silent
like
the
stones
on
which
he
walked
,
dead
to
him
,
to
*NL*
him
alone
...
All
at
once
at
the
end
of
the
street
,
two
hundred
yards
*NL*
away
,
in
the
gathering
dusk
he
saw
a
crowd
and
heard
talk
and
shouts
.
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
crowd
stood
a
carriage
...
A
light
gleamed
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
street
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
Raskolnikov
turned
to
the
right
*NL*
and
went
up
to
the
crowd
.
He
seemed
to
clutch
at
everything
and
smiled
*NL*
coldly
when
he
recognised
it
,
for
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
*NL*
the
police
station
and
knew
that
it
would
all
soon
be
over
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
An
elegant
carriage
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
a
pair
of
*NL*
spirited
grey
horses
;
there
was
no
one
in
it
,
and
the
coachman
had
got
*NL*
off
his
box
and
stood
by
;
the
horses
were
being
held
by
the
bridle
...
*NL*
A
mass
of
people
had
gathered
round
,
the
police
standing
in
front
.
One
*NL*
of
them
held
a
lighted
lantern
which
he
was
turning
on
something
lying
*NL*
close
to
the
wheels
.
Everyone
was
talking
,
shouting
,
exclaiming
;
the
*NL*
coachman
seemed
at
a
loss
and
kept
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
misfortune
!
Good
Lord
,
what
a
misfortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
pushed
his
way
in
as
far
as
he
could
,
and
succeeded
at
last
*NL*
in
seeing
the
object
of
the
commotion
and
interest
.
On
the
ground
a
*NL*
man
who
had
been
run
over
lay
apparently
unconscious
,
and
covered
with
*NL*
blood
;
he
was
very
badly
dressed
,
but
not
like
a
workman
.
Blood
was
*NL*
flowing
from
his
head
and
face
;
his
face
was
crushed
,
mutilated
and
*NL*
disfigured
.
He
was
evidently
badly
injured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merciful
heaven
!
''
wailed
the
coachman
,
``
what
more
could
I
do
?
If
I
'd
*NL*
been
driving
fast
or
had
not
shouted
to
him
,
but
I
was
going
quietly
,
*NL*
not
in
a
hurry
.
Everyone
could
see
I
was
going
along
just
like
everybody
*NL*
else
.
A
drunken
man
ca
n't
walk
straight
,
we
all
know
...
I
saw
him
*NL*
crossing
the
street
,
staggering
and
almost
falling
.
I
shouted
again
*NL*
and
a
second
and
a
third
time
,
then
I
held
the
horses
in
,
but
he
fell
*NL*
straight
under
their
feet
!
Either
he
did
it
on
purpose
or
he
was
very
*NL*
tipsy
...
The
horses
are
young
and
ready
to
take
fright
...
they
started
,
*NL*
he
screamed
...
that
made
them
worse
.
That
's
how
it
happened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
how
it
was
,
''
a
voice
in
the
crowd
confirmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shouted
,
that
's
true
,
he
shouted
three
times
,
''
another
voice
*NL*
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
times
it
was
,
we
all
heard
it
,
''
shouted
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
coachman
was
not
very
much
distressed
and
frightened
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
carriage
belonged
to
a
rich
and
important
person
who
*NL*
was
awaiting
it
somewhere
;
the
police
,
of
course
,
were
in
no
little
*NL*
anxiety
to
avoid
upsetting
his
arrangements
.
All
they
had
to
do
was
to
*NL*
take
the
injured
man
to
the
police
station
and
the
hospital
.
No
one
knew
*NL*
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Raskolnikov
had
squeezed
in
and
stooped
closer
over
him
.
The
*NL*
lantern
suddenly
lighted
up
the
unfortunate
man
's
face
.
He
recognised
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
him
!
I
know
him
!
''
he
shouted
,
pushing
to
the
front
.
``
It
's
a
*NL*
government
clerk
retired
from
the
service
,
Marmeladov
.
He
lives
close
*NL*
by
in
Kozel
's
house
...
Make
haste
for
a
doctor
!
I
will
pay
,
see
?
''
He
*NL*
pulled
money
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
policeman
.
He
was
in
*NL*
violent
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
police
were
glad
that
they
had
found
out
who
the
man
was
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
gave
his
own
name
and
address
,
and
,
as
earnestly
as
if
it
*NL*
had
been
his
father
,
he
besought
the
police
to
carry
the
unconscious
*NL*
Marmeladov
to
his
lodging
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
here
,
three
houses
away
,
''
he
said
eagerly
,
``
the
house
belongs
to
*NL*
Kozel
,
a
rich
German
.
He
was
going
home
,
no
doubt
drunk
.
I
know
him
,
*NL*
he
is
a
drunkard
.
He
has
a
family
there
,
a
wife
,
children
,
he
has
one
*NL*
daughter
...
It
will
take
time
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
,
and
there
is
*NL*
sure
to
be
a
doctor
in
the
house
.
I
'll
pay
,
I
'll
pay
!
At
least
he
will
*NL*
be
looked
after
at
home
...
they
will
help
him
at
once
.
But
he
'll
die
*NL*
before
you
get
him
to
the
hospital
.
''
He
managed
to
slip
something
*NL*
unseen
into
the
policeman
's
hand
.
But
the
thing
was
straightforward
*NL*
and
legitimate
,
and
in
any
case
help
was
closer
here
.
They
raised
the
*NL*
injured
man
;
people
volunteered
to
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kozel
's
house
was
thirty
yards
away
.
Raskolnikov
walked
behind
,
*NL*
carefully
holding
Marmeladov
's
head
and
showing
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
this
way
!
We
must
take
him
upstairs
head
foremost
.
Turn
*NL*
round
!
I
'll
pay
,
I
'll
make
it
worth
your
while
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
just
begun
,
as
she
always
did
at
every
free
*NL*
moment
,
walking
to
and
fro
in
her
little
room
from
window
to
stove
and
*NL*
back
again
,
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
chest
,
talking
to
herself
*NL*
and
coughing
.
Of
late
she
had
begun
to
talk
more
than
ever
to
her
eldest
*NL*
girl
,
Polenka
,
a
child
of
ten
,
who
,
though
there
was
much
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
understood
very
well
that
her
mother
needed
her
,
and
so
*NL*
always
watched
her
with
her
big
clever
eyes
and
strove
her
utmost
*NL*
to
appear
to
understand
.
This
time
Polenka
was
undressing
her
little
*NL*
brother
,
who
had
been
unwell
all
day
and
was
going
to
bed
.
The
boy
was
*NL*
waiting
for
her
to
take
off
his
shirt
,
which
had
to
be
washed
at
night
.
*NL*
He
was
sitting
straight
and
motionless
on
a
chair
,
with
a
silent
,
*NL*
serious
face
,
with
his
legs
stretched
out
straight
before
him
--
heels
*NL*
together
and
toes
turned
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
listening
to
what
his
mother
was
saying
to
his
sister
,
sitting
*NL*
perfectly
still
with
pouting
lips
and
wide-open
eyes
,
just
as
all
good
*NL*
little
boys
have
to
sit
when
they
are
undressed
to
go
to
bed
.
A
little
*NL*
girl
,
still
younger
,
dressed
literally
in
rags
,
stood
at
the
screen
,
*NL*
waiting
for
her
turn
.
The
door
on
to
the
stairs
was
open
to
relieve
*NL*
them
a
little
from
the
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
which
floated
in
from
the
*NL*
other
rooms
and
brought
on
long
terrible
fits
of
coughing
in
the
poor
,
*NL*
consumptive
woman
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
seemed
to
have
grown
even
thinner
*NL*
during
that
week
and
the
hectic
flush
on
her
face
was
brighter
than
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
believe
,
you
ca
n't
imagine
,
Polenka
,
''
she
said
,
walking
*NL*
about
the
room
,
``
what
a
happy
luxurious
life
we
had
in
my
papa
's
house
*NL*
and
how
this
drunkard
has
brought
me
,
and
will
bring
you
all
,
to
ruin
!
*NL*
Papa
was
a
civil
colonel
and
only
a
step
from
being
a
governor
;
so
that
*NL*
everyone
who
came
to
see
him
said
,
`
We
look
upon
you
,
Ivan
Mihailovitch
,
*NL*
as
our
governor
!
'
When
I.
.
.
when
...
''
she
coughed
violently
,
``
oh
,
cursed
*NL*
life
,
''
she
cried
,
clearing
her
throat
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
*NL*
breast
,
``
when
I.
.
.
when
at
the
last
ball
...
at
the
marshal
's
...
*NL*
Princess
Bezzemelny
saw
me
--
who
gave
me
the
blessing
when
your
father
*NL*
and
I
were
married
,
Polenka
--
she
asked
at
once
`
Is
n't
that
the
pretty
*NL*
girl
who
danced
the
shawl
dance
at
the
breaking-up
?

-LRB-
You
must
mend
*NL*
that
tear
,
you
must
take
your
needle
and
darn
it
as
I
showed
you
,
or
*NL*
to-morrow

cough
,
cough
,
cough
--
he
will
make
the
hole
bigger

she
*NL*
articulated
with
effort
.
-RRB-
``
Prince
Schegolskoy
,
a
kammerjunker
,
had
just
*NL*
come
from
Petersburg
then
...
he
danced
the
mazurka
with
me
and
wanted
to
*NL*
make
me
an
offer
next
day
;
but
I
thanked
him
in
flattering
expressions
*NL*
and
told
him
that
my
heart
had
long
been
another
's
.
That
other
was
your
*NL*
father
,
Polya
;
papa
was
fearfully
angry
...
Is
the
water
ready
?
Give
me
*NL*
the
shirt

and
the
stockings

Lida

said
she
to
the
youngest
one
,
``
you
*NL*
must
manage
without
your
chemise
to-night
...
and
lay
your
stockings
out
*NL*
with

I
'll
wash
them
together

How
is
it
that
drunken
vagabond
*NL*
does
n't
come
in

He
has
worn
his
shirt

it
looks
like
a

*NL*
he
has
torn
it
to
rags

I
'd
do
it
all
together

so

have
to
*NL*
work
two
nights
running

Oh
,
dear
!
-LRB-
Cough
,
cough
,
cough
,
cough
!
-RRB-
Again
!
*NL*
What
's
this
?
''
she
cried
,
noticing
a
crowd
in
the
passage
and
the
men
,
*NL*
who
were
pushing
into
her
room
,
carrying
a
burden
.
``
What
is
it
?
What
are
*NL*
they
bringing
?
Mercy
on
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
to
put
him
?
''
asked
the
policeman
,
looking
round
when
*NL*
Marmeladov
,
unconscious
and
covered
with
blood
,
had
been
carried
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
sofa
!
Put
him
straight
on
the
sofa
,
with
his
head
this
way
,
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
showed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
over
in
the
road
!
Drunk
!
''
someone
shouted
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
stood
,
turning
white
and
gasping
for
breath
.
The
*NL*
children
were
terrified
.
Little
Lida
screamed
,
rushed
to
Polenka
and
*NL*
clutched
at
her
,
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
laid
Marmeladov
down
,
Raskolnikov
flew
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
be
calm
,
do
n't
be
frightened
!
''
he
said
,
speaking
*NL*
quickly
,
``
he
was
crossing
the
road
and
was
run
over
by
a
carriage
,
do
n't
*NL*
be
frightened
,
he
will
come
to
,
I
told
them
bring
him
here
...
I
've
been
*NL*
here
already
,
you
remember
?
He
will
come
to
;
I
'll
pay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
done
it
this
time
!
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
cried
despairingly
and
she
*NL*
rushed
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
noticed
at
once
that
she
was
not
one
of
those
women
who
*NL*
swoon
easily
.
She
instantly
placed
under
the
luckless
man
's
head
a
*NL*
pillow
,
which
no
one
had
thought
of
and
began
undressing
and
examining
*NL*
him
.
She
kept
her
head
,
forgetting
herself
,
biting
her
trembling
lips
*NL*
and
stifling
the
screams
which
were
ready
to
break
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
meanwhile
induced
someone
to
run
for
a
doctor
.
There
was
a
*NL*
doctor
,
it
appeared
,
next
door
but
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sent
for
a
doctor
,
''
he
kept
assuring
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
``
do
n't
be
*NL*
uneasy
,
I
'll
pay
.
Have
n't
you
water
?
...
and
give
me
a
napkin
or
a
towel
,
*NL*
anything
,
as
quick
as
you
can
...
He
is
injured
,
but
not
killed
,
believe
*NL*
me
...
We
shall
see
what
the
doctor
says
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
ran
to
the
window
;
there
,
on
a
broken
chair
in
the
*NL*
corner
,
a
large
earthenware
basin
full
of
water
had
been
stood
,
in
*NL*
readiness
for
washing
her
children
's
and
husband
's
linen
that
night
.
*NL*
This
washing
was
done
by
Katerina
Ivanovna
at
night
at
least
twice
a
*NL*
week
,
if
not
oftener
.
For
the
family
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
they
*NL*
were
practically
without
change
of
linen
,
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
could
*NL*
not
endure
uncleanliness
and
,
rather
than
see
dirt
in
the
house
,
she
*NL*
preferred
to
wear
herself
out
at
night
,
working
beyond
her
strength
when
*NL*
the
rest
were
asleep
,
so
as
to
get
the
wet
linen
hung
on
a
line
and
dry
*NL*
by
the
morning
.
She
took
up
the
basin
of
water
at
Raskolnikov
's
request
,
*NL*
but
almost
fell
down
with
her
burden
.
But
the
latter
had
already
*NL*
succeeded
in
finding
a
towel
,
wetted
it
and
began
washing
the
blood
off
*NL*
Marmeladov
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
stood
by
,
breathing
painfully
and
pressing
her
hands
*NL*
to
her
breast
.
She
was
in
need
of
attention
herself
.
Raskolnikov
began
*NL*
to
realise
that
he
might
have
made
a
mistake
in
having
the
injured
man
*NL*
brought
here
.
The
policeman
,
too
,
stood
in
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Polenka
,
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
``
run
to
Sonia
,
make
haste
.
If
you
*NL*
do
n't
find
her
at
home
,
leave
word
that
her
father
has
been
run
over
*NL*
and
that
she
is
to
come
here
at
once
...
when
she
comes
in
.
Run
,
Polenka
!
*NL*
there
,
put
on
the
shawl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
your
fastest
!
''
cried
the
little
boy
on
the
chair
suddenly
,
after
*NL*
which
he
relapsed
into
the
same
dumb
rigidity
,
with
round
eyes
,
his
*NL*
heels
thrust
forward
and
his
toes
spread
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
room
had
become
so
full
of
people
that
you
could
n't
have
*NL*
dropped
a
pin
.
The
policemen
left
,
all
except
one
,
who
remained
for
a
*NL*
time
,
trying
to
drive
out
the
people
who
came
in
from
the
stairs
.
Almost
*NL*
all
Madame
Lippevechsel
's
lodgers
had
streamed
in
from
the
inner
rooms
*NL*
of
the
flat
;
at
first
they
were
squeezed
together
in
the
doorway
,
but
*NL*
afterwards
they
overflowed
into
the
room
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
flew
into
a
*NL*
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
let
him
die
in
peace
,
at
least
,
''
she
shouted
at
the
crowd
,
*NL*
``
is
it
a
spectacle
for
you
to
gape
at
?
With
cigarettes
!
-LRB-
Cough
,
cough
,
*NL*
cough
!
-RRB-
You
might
as
well
keep
your
hats
on
...
And
there
is
one
in
his
*NL*
hat
!
...
Get
away
!
You
should
respect
the
dead
,
at
least
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cough
choked
her
--
but
her
reproaches
were
not
without
result
.
They
*NL*
evidently
stood
in
some
awe
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
The
lodgers
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
squeezed
back
into
the
doorway
with
that
strange
inner
feeling
*NL*
of
satisfaction
which
may
be
observed
in
the
presence
of
a
sudden
*NL*
accident
,
even
in
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
victim
,
from
which
*NL*
no
living
man
is
exempt
,
even
in
spite
of
the
sincerest
sympathy
and
*NL*
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Voices
outside
were
heard
,
however
,
speaking
of
the
hospital
and
saying
*NL*
that
they
'd
no
business
to
make
a
disturbance
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
business
to
die
!
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
she
was
rushing
to
*NL*
the
door
to
vent
her
wrath
upon
them
,
but
in
the
doorway
came
face
to
*NL*
face
with
Madame
Lippevechsel
who
had
only
just
heard
of
the
accident
*NL*
and
ran
in
to
restore
order
.
She
was
a
particularly
quarrelsome
and
*NL*
irresponsible
German
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
God
!
''
she
cried
,
clasping
her
hands
,
``
your
husband
drunken
*NL*
horses
have
trampled
!
To
the
hospital
with
him
!
I
am
the
landlady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amalia
Ludwigovna
,
I
beg
you
to
recollect
what
you
are
saying
,
''
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
began
haughtily
-LRB-
she
always
took
a
haughty
tone
with
*NL*
the
landlady
that
she
might
``
remember
her
place
''
and
even
now
could
not
*NL*
deny
herself
this
satisfaction
-RRB-
.
``
Amalia
Ludwigovna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
you
once
before
told
that
you
to
call
me
Amalia
Ludwigovna
may
*NL*
not
dare
;
I
am
Amalia
Ivanovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
but
Amalia
Ludwigovna
,
and
as
I
am
not
*NL*
one
of
your
despicable
flatterers
like
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
,
who
's
laughing
*NL*
behind
the
door
at
this
moment
-LRB-
a
laugh
and
a
cry
of
`
they
are
at
it
*NL*
again
'
was
in
fact
audible
at
the
door
-RRB-
so
I
shall
always
call
you
*NL*
Amalia
Ludwigovna
,
though
I
fail
to
understand
why
you
dislike
that
*NL*
name
.
You
can
see
for
yourself
what
has
happened
to
Semyon
Zaharovitch
;
*NL*
he
is
dying
.
I
beg
you
to
close
that
door
at
once
and
to
admit
no
one
.
*NL*
Let
him
at
least
die
in
peace
!
Or
I
warn
you
the
Governor-General
,
*NL*
himself
,
shall
be
informed
of
your
conduct
to-morrow
.
The
prince
knew
*NL*
me
as
a
girl
;
he
remembers
Semyon
Zaharovitch
well
and
has
often
been
*NL*
a
benefactor
to
him
.
Everyone
knows
that
Semyon
Zaharovitch
had
many
*NL*
friends
and
protectors
,
whom
he
abandoned
himself
from
an
honourable
*NL*
pride
,
knowing
his
unhappy
weakness
,
but
now
-LRB-
she
pointed
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
-RRB-
a
generous
young
man
has
come
to
our
assistance
,
who
has
*NL*
wealth
and
connections
and
whom
Semyon
Zaharovitch
has
known
from
a
*NL*
child
.
You
may
rest
assured
,
Amalia
Ludwigovna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
uttered
with
extreme
rapidity
,
getting
quicker
and
quicker
,
*NL*
but
a
cough
suddenly
cut
short
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
eloquence
.
At
that
*NL*
instant
the
dying
man
recovered
consciousness
and
uttered
a
groan
;
she
*NL*
ran
to
him
.
The
injured
man
opened
his
eyes
and
without
recognition
or
*NL*
understanding
gazed
at
Raskolnikov
who
was
bending
over
him
.
He
drew
*NL*
deep
,
slow
,
painful
breaths
;
blood
oozed
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
*NL*
and
drops
of
perspiration
came
out
on
his
forehead
.
Not
recognising
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
he
began
looking
round
uneasily
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
looked
*NL*
at
him
with
a
sad
but
stern
face
,
and
tears
trickled
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
His
whole
chest
is
crushed
!
How
he
is
bleeding
,
''
she
said
*NL*
in
despair
.
``
We
must
take
off
his
clothes
.
Turn
a
little
,
Semyon
*NL*
Zaharovitch
,
if
you
can
,
''
she
cried
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marmeladov
recognised
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
priest
,
''
he
articulated
huskily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
walked
to
the
window
,
laid
her
head
against
the
window
*NL*
frame
and
exclaimed
in
despair
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
cursed
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
priest
,
''
the
dying
man
said
again
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
gone
for
him
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
shouted
to
him
,
he
obeyed
her
*NL*
shout
and
was
silent
.
With
sad
and
timid
eyes
he
looked
for
her
;
she
*NL*
returned
and
stood
by
his
pillow
.
He
seemed
a
little
easier
but
not
for
*NL*
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
his
eyes
rested
on
little
Lida
,
his
favourite
,
who
was
shaking
in
*NL*
the
corner
,
as
though
she
were
in
a
fit
,
and
staring
at
him
with
her
*NL*
wondering
childish
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ah
,
''
he
signed
towards
her
uneasily
.
He
wanted
to
say
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
now
?
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barefoot
,
barefoot
!
''
he
muttered
,
indicating
with
frenzied
eyes
the
*NL*
child
's
bare
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
cried
irritably
,
``
you
know
why
she
is
*NL*
barefooted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
the
doctor
,
''
exclaimed
Raskolnikov
,
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
came
in
,
a
precise
little
old
man
,
a
German
,
looking
about
*NL*
him
mistrustfully
;
he
went
up
to
the
sick
man
,
took
his
pulse
,
carefully
*NL*
felt
his
head
and
with
the
help
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
he
unbuttoned
the
*NL*
blood-stained
shirt
,
and
bared
the
injured
man
's
chest
.
It
was
gashed
,
*NL*
crushed
and
fractured
,
several
ribs
on
the
right
side
were
broken
.
*NL*
On
the
left
side
,
just
over
the
heart
,
was
a
large
,
sinister-looking
*NL*
yellowish-black
bruise
--
a
cruel
kick
from
the
horse
's
hoof
.
The
doctor
*NL*
frowned
.
The
policeman
told
him
that
he
was
caught
in
the
wheel
and
*NL*
turned
round
with
it
for
thirty
yards
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
that
he
has
recovered
consciousness
,
''
the
doctor
*NL*
whispered
softly
to
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
die
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
really
no
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
faintest
!
He
is
at
the
last
gasp
...
His
head
is
badly
injured
,
*NL*
too
...
Hm
...
I
could
bleed
him
if
you
like
,
but
...
it
would
be
useless
.
*NL*
He
is
bound
to
die
within
the
next
five
or
ten
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
bleed
him
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
...
But
I
warn
you
it
will
be
perfectly
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
other
steps
were
heard
;
the
crowd
in
the
passage
parted
,
*NL*
and
the
priest
,
a
little
,
grey
old
man
,
appeared
in
the
doorway
bearing
*NL*
the
sacrament
.
A
policeman
had
gone
for
him
at
the
time
of
the
accident
.
*NL*
The
doctor
changed
places
with
him
,
exchanging
glances
with
him
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
begged
the
doctor
to
remain
a
little
while
.
He
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
and
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
stepped
back
.
The
confession
was
soon
over
.
The
dying
man
probably
*NL*
understood
little
;
he
could
only
utter
indistinct
broken
sounds
.
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
took
little
Lida
,
lifted
the
boy
from
the
chair
,
knelt
*NL*
down
in
the
corner
by
the
stove
and
made
the
children
kneel
in
front
of
*NL*
her
.
The
little
girl
was
still
trembling
;
but
the
boy
,
kneeling
on
his
*NL*
little
bare
knees
,
lifted
his
hand
rhythmically
,
crossing
himself
with
*NL*
precision
and
bowed
down
,
touching
the
floor
with
his
forehead
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
afford
him
especial
satisfaction
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
bit
her
*NL*
lips
and
held
back
her
tears
;
she
prayed
,
too
,
now
and
then
pulling
*NL*
straight
the
boy
's
shirt
,
and
managed
to
cover
the
girl
's
bare
shoulders
*NL*
with
a
kerchief
,
which
she
took
from
the
chest
without
rising
from
her
*NL*
knees
or
ceasing
to
pray
.
Meanwhile
the
door
from
the
inner
rooms
was
*NL*
opened
inquisitively
again
.
In
the
passage
the
crowd
of
spectators
from
*NL*
all
the
flats
on
the
staircase
grew
denser
and
denser
,
but
they
did
not
*NL*
venture
beyond
the
threshold
.
A
single
candle-end
lighted
up
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Polenka
forced
her
way
through
the
crowd
at
the
door
.
She
*NL*
came
in
panting
from
running
so
fast
,
took
off
her
kerchief
,
looked
for
*NL*
her
mother
,
went
up
to
her
and
said
,
``
She
's
coming
,
I
met
her
in
the
*NL*
street
.
''
Her
mother
made
her
kneel
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Timidly
and
noiselessly
a
young
girl
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
,
*NL*
and
strange
was
her
appearance
in
that
room
,
in
the
midst
of
want
,
rags
,
*NL*
death
and
despair
.
She
,
too
,
was
in
rags
,
her
attire
was
all
of
*NL*
the
cheapest
,
but
decked
out
in
gutter
finery
of
a
special
stamp
,
*NL*
unmistakably
betraying
its
shameful
purpose
.
Sonia
stopped
short
in
the
*NL*
doorway
and
looked
about
her
bewildered
,
unconscious
of
everything
.
*NL*
She
forgot
her
fourth-hand
,
gaudy
silk
dress
,
so
unseemly
here
with
*NL*
its
ridiculous
long
train
,
and
her
immense
crinoline
that
filled
up
the
*NL*
whole
doorway
,
and
her
light-coloured
shoes
,
and
the
parasol
she
brought
*NL*
with
her
,
though
it
was
no
use
at
night
,
and
the
absurd
round
straw
hat
*NL*
with
its
flaring
flame-coloured
feather
.
Under
this
rakishly-tilted
hat
*NL*
was
a
pale
,
frightened
little
face
with
lips
parted
and
eyes
staring
in
*NL*
terror
.
Sonia
was
a
small
thin
girl
of
eighteen
with
fair
hair
,
rather
*NL*
pretty
,
with
wonderful
blue
eyes
.
She
looked
intently
at
the
bed
and
the
*NL*
priest
;
she
too
was
out
of
breath
with
running
.
At
last
whispers
,
some
*NL*
words
in
the
crowd
probably
,
reached
her
.
She
looked
down
and
took
a
*NL*
step
forward
into
the
room
,
still
keeping
close
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
service
was
over
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
went
up
to
her
husband
again
.
*NL*
The
priest
stepped
back
and
turned
to
say
a
few
words
of
admonition
and
*NL*
consolation
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
on
leaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
with
these
?
''
she
interrupted
sharply
and
irritably
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
little
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
is
merciful
;
look
to
the
Most
High
for
succour
,
''
the
priest
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
!
He
is
merciful
,
but
not
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
sin
,
a
sin
,
madam
,
''
observed
the
priest
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
n't
that
a
sin
?
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
pointing
to
the
dying
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
those
who
have
involuntarily
caused
the
accident
will
agree
to
*NL*
compensate
you
,
at
least
for
the
loss
of
his
earnings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
!
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
angrily
waving
her
hand
.
*NL*
``
And
why
should
they
compensate
me
?
Why
,
he
was
drunk
and
threw
himself
*NL*
under
the
horses
!
What
earnings
?
He
brought
us
in
nothing
but
misery
.
*NL*
He
drank
everything
away
,
the
drunkard
!
He
robbed
us
to
get
drink
,
he
*NL*
wasted
their
lives
and
mine
for
drink
!
And
thank
God
he
's
dying
!
One
*NL*
less
to
keep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
forgive
in
the
hour
of
death
,
that
's
a
sin
,
madam
,
such
*NL*
feelings
are
a
great
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
busy
with
the
dying
man
;
she
was
giving
him
water
,
*NL*
wiping
the
blood
and
sweat
from
his
head
,
setting
his
pillow
straight
,
*NL*
and
had
only
turned
now
and
then
for
a
moment
to
address
the
priest
.
Now
*NL*
she
flew
at
him
almost
in
a
frenzy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
father
!
That
's
words
and
only
words
!
Forgive
!
If
he
'd
not
been
run
*NL*
over
,
he
'd
have
come
home
to-day
drunk
and
his
only
shirt
dirty
and
*NL*
in
rags
and
he
'd
have
fallen
asleep
like
a
log
,
and
I
should
have
been
*NL*
sousing
and
rinsing
till
daybreak
,
washing
his
rags
and
the
children
's
*NL*
and
then
drying
them
by
the
window
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
I
*NL*
should
have
been
darning
them
.
That
's
how
I
spend
my
nights
!
...
What
's
*NL*
the
use
of
talking
of
forgiveness
!
I
have
forgiven
as
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
hollow
cough
interrupted
her
words
.
She
put
her
handkerchief
*NL*
to
her
lips
and
showed
it
to
the
priest
,
pressing
her
other
hand
to
her
*NL*
aching
chest
.
The
handkerchief
was
covered
with
blood
.
The
priest
bowed
*NL*
his
head
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marmeladov
was
in
the
last
agony
;
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
face
*NL*
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
who
was
bending
over
him
again
.
He
kept
trying
*NL*
to
say
something
to
her
;
he
began
moving
his
tongue
with
difficulty
and
*NL*
articulating
indistinctly
,
but
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
understanding
that
he
*NL*
wanted
to
ask
her
forgiveness
,
called
peremptorily
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
!
No
need
!
I
know
what
you
want
to
say
!
''
And
the
sick
man
*NL*
was
silent
,
but
at
the
same
instant
his
wandering
eyes
strayed
to
the
*NL*
doorway
and
he
saw
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
then
he
had
not
noticed
her
:
she
was
standing
in
the
shadow
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
Who
's
that
?
''
he
said
suddenly
in
a
thick
gasping
voice
,
*NL*
in
agitation
,
turning
his
eyes
in
horror
towards
the
door
where
his
*NL*
daughter
was
standing
,
and
trying
to
sit
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
down
!
Lie
do-own
!
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
unnatural
strength
he
had
succeeded
in
propping
himself
on
his
*NL*
elbow
.
He
looked
wildly
and
fixedly
for
some
time
on
his
daughter
,
as
*NL*
though
not
recognising
her
.
He
had
never
seen
her
before
in
such
attire
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
recognised
her
,
crushed
and
ashamed
in
her
humiliation
and
*NL*
gaudy
finery
,
meekly
awaiting
her
turn
to
say
good-bye
to
her
dying
*NL*
father
.
His
face
showed
intense
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonia
!
Daughter
!
Forgive
!
''
he
cried
,
and
he
tried
to
hold
out
his
hand
*NL*
to
her
,
but
losing
his
balance
,
he
fell
off
the
sofa
,
face
downwards
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
They
rushed
to
pick
him
up
,
they
put
him
on
the
sofa
;
but
he
*NL*
was
dying
.
Sonia
with
a
faint
cry
ran
up
,
embraced
him
and
remained
so
*NL*
without
moving
.
He
died
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
what
he
wanted
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
cried
,
seeing
her
husband
's
*NL*
dead
body
.
``
Well
,
what
's
to
be
done
now
?
How
am
I
to
bury
him
!
What
can
*NL*
I
give
them
to-morrow
to
eat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
up
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
''
he
began
,
``
last
week
your
husband
told
me
all
his
*NL*
life
and
circumstances
...
Believe
me
,
he
spoke
of
you
with
passionate
*NL*
reverence
.
From
that
evening
,
when
I
learnt
how
devoted
he
was
to
you
*NL*
all
and
how
he
loved
and
respected
you
especially
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
his
unfortunate
weakness
,
from
that
evening
we
became
*NL*
friends
...
Allow
me
now
...
to
do
something
...
to
repay
my
debt
to
my
*NL*
dead
friend
.
Here
are
twenty
roubles
,
I
think
--
and
if
that
can
be
of
any
*NL*
assistance
to
you
,
then
...
I.
.
.
in
short
,
I
will
come
again
,
I
will
*NL*
be
sure
to
come
again
...
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
come
again
to-morrow
...
*NL*
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
,
squeezing
his
way
through
the
crowd
*NL*
to
the
stairs
.
But
in
the
crowd
he
suddenly
jostled
against
Nikodim
*NL*
Fomitch
,
who
had
heard
of
the
accident
and
had
come
to
give
instructions
*NL*
in
person
.
They
had
not
met
since
the
scene
at
the
police
station
,
but
*NL*
Nikodim
Fomitch
knew
him
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
is
that
you
?
''
he
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
dead
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
``
The
doctor
and
the
priest
have
been
,
*NL*
all
as
it
should
have
been
.
Do
n't
worry
the
poor
woman
too
much
,
she
is
*NL*
in
consumption
as
it
is
.
Try
and
cheer
her
up
,
if
possible
...
you
are
a
*NL*
kind-hearted
man
,
I
know
...
''
he
added
with
a
smile
,
looking
straight
in
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
spattered
with
blood
,
''
observed
Nikodim
Fomitch
,
noticing
*NL*
in
the
lamplight
some
fresh
stains
on
Raskolnikov
's
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I
'm
covered
with
blood
,
''
Raskolnikov
said
with
a
peculiar
air
;
*NL*
then
he
smiled
,
nodded
and
went
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
down
slowly
and
deliberately
,
feverish
but
not
conscious
*NL*
of
it
,
entirely
absorbed
in
a
new
overwhelming
sensation
of
life
and
*NL*
strength
that
surged
up
suddenly
within
him
.
This
sensation
might
be
*NL*
compared
to
that
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
who
has
suddenly
been
*NL*
pardoned
.
Halfway
down
the
staircase
he
was
overtaken
by
the
priest
on
*NL*
his
way
home
;
Raskolnikov
let
him
pass
,
exchanging
a
silent
greeting
*NL*
with
him
.
He
was
just
descending
the
last
steps
when
he
heard
rapid
*NL*
footsteps
behind
him
.
Someone
overtook
him
;
it
was
Polenka
.
She
was
*NL*
running
after
him
,
calling
``
Wait
!
wait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
.
She
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
stopped
*NL*
short
a
step
above
him
.
A
dim
light
came
in
from
the
yard
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
could
distinguish
the
child
's
thin
but
pretty
little
face
,
looking
at
*NL*
him
with
a
bright
childish
smile
.
She
had
run
after
him
with
a
message
*NL*
which
she
was
evidently
glad
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
what
is
your
name
?
...
and
where
do
you
live
?
''
she
said
*NL*
hurriedly
in
a
breathless
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
both
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
rapture
.
It
was
such
a
joy
to
him
to
look
at
her
,
he
could
not
have
said
*NL*
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
sent
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Sonia
sent
me
,
''
answered
the
girl
,
smiling
still
more
brightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
sister
Sonia
sent
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
sent
me
,
too
...
when
sister
Sonia
was
sending
me
,
mamma
came
up
,
*NL*
too
,
and
said
`
Run
fast
,
Polenka
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
sister
Sonia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
her
more
than
anyone
,
''
Polenka
answered
with
a
peculiar
*NL*
earnestness
,
and
her
smile
became
graver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
answer
he
saw
the
little
girl
's
face
approaching
him
,
her
full
*NL*
lips
naively
held
out
to
kiss
him
.
Suddenly
her
arms
as
thin
as
sticks
*NL*
held
him
tightly
,
her
head
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
the
little
girl
*NL*
wept
softly
,
pressing
her
face
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
father
,
''
she
said
a
moment
later
,
raising
her
*NL*
tear-stained
face
and
brushing
away
the
tears
with
her
hands
.
``
It
's
*NL*
nothing
but
misfortunes
now
,
''
she
added
suddenly
with
that
peculiarly
*NL*
sedate
air
which
children
try
hard
to
assume
when
they
want
to
speak
*NL*
like
grown-up
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your
father
love
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
loved
Lida
most
,
''
she
went
on
very
seriously
without
a
smile
,
*NL*
exactly
like
grown-up
people
,
``
he
loved
her
because
she
is
little
and
*NL*
because
she
is
ill
,
too
.
And
he
always
used
to
bring
her
presents
.
But
*NL*
he
taught
us
to
read
and
me
grammar
and
scripture
,
too
,
''
she
added
with
*NL*
dignity
.
``
And
mother
never
used
to
say
anything
,
but
we
knew
that
she
*NL*
liked
it
and
father
knew
it
,
too
.
And
mother
wants
to
teach
me
French
,
*NL*
for
it
's
time
my
education
began
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
your
prayers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
we
do
!
We
knew
them
long
ago
.
I
say
my
prayers
to
myself
*NL*
as
I
am
a
big
girl
now
,
but
Kolya
and
Lida
say
them
aloud
with
mother
.
*NL*
First
they
repeat
the
`
Ave
Maria
'
and
then
another
prayer
:
`
Lord
,
*NL*
forgive
and
bless
sister
Sonia
,
'
and
then
another
,
`
Lord
,
forgive
and
*NL*
bless
our
second
father
.
'
For
our
elder
father
is
dead
and
this
is
*NL*
another
one
,
but
we
do
pray
for
the
other
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Polenka
,
my
name
is
Rodion
.
Pray
sometimes
for
me
,
too
.
`
And
Thy
*NL*
servant
Rodion
,
'
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pray
for
you
all
the
rest
of
my
life
,
''
the
little
girl
declared
*NL*
hotly
,
and
suddenly
smiling
again
she
rushed
at
him
and
hugged
him
*NL*
warmly
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
told
her
his
name
and
address
and
promised
to
be
sure
to
*NL*
come
next
day
.
The
child
went
away
quite
enchanted
with
him
.
It
was
past
*NL*
ten
when
he
came
out
into
the
street
.
In
five
minutes
he
was
standing
on
*NL*
the
bridge
at
the
spot
where
the
woman
had
jumped
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
''
he
pronounced
resolutely
and
triumphantly
.
``
I
've
done
with
*NL*
fancies
,
imaginary
terrors
and
phantoms
!
Life
is
real
!
have
n't
I
lived
*NL*
just
now
?
My
life
has
not
yet
died
with
that
old
woman
!
The
Kingdom
of
*NL*
Heaven
to
her
--
and
now
enough
,
madam
,
leave
me
in
peace
!
Now
for
the
*NL*
reign
of
reason
and
light
...
and
of
will
,
and
of
strength
...
and
now
*NL*
we
will
see
!
We
will
try
our
strength
!
''
he
added
defiantly
,
as
though
*NL*
challenging
some
power
of
darkness
.
``
And
I
was
ready
to
consent
to
live
*NL*
in
a
square
of
space
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
weak
at
this
moment
,
but
...
I
believe
my
illness
is
all
over
.
*NL*
I
knew
it
would
be
over
when
I
went
out
.
By
the
way
,
Potchinkov
's
house
*NL*
is
only
a
few
steps
away
.
I
certainly
must
go
to
Razumihin
even
if
*NL*
it
were
not
close
by
...
let
him
win
his
bet
!
Let
us
give
him
some
*NL*
satisfaction
,
too
--
no
matter
!
Strength
,
strength
is
what
one
wants
,
you
*NL*
can
get
nothing
without
it
,
and
strength
must
be
won
by
strength
--
that
's
*NL*
what
they
do
n't
know
,
''
he
added
proudly
and
self-confidently
and
*NL*
he
walked
with
flagging
footsteps
from
the
bridge
.
Pride
and
*NL*
self-confidence
grew
continually
stronger
in
him
;
he
was
becoming
*NL*
a
different
man
every
moment
.
What
was
it
had
happened
to
work
this
*NL*
revolution
in
him
?
He
did
not
know
himself
;
like
a
man
catching
at
a
*NL*
straw
,
he
suddenly
felt
that
he
,
too
,
`
could
live
,
that
there
was
still
*NL*
life
for
him
,
that
his
life
had
not
died
with
the
old
woman
.
'
Perhaps
he
*NL*
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
with
his
conclusions
,
but
he
did
not
think
of
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
did
ask
her
to
remember
`
Thy
servant
Rodion
'
in
her
prayers
,
''
the
*NL*
idea
struck
him
.
``
Well
,
that
was
...
in
case
of
emergency
,
''
he
added
and
*NL*
laughed
himself
at
his
boyish
sally
.
He
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
easily
found
Razumihin
;
the
new
lodger
was
already
known
at
*NL*
Potchinkov
's
and
the
porter
at
once
showed
him
the
way
.
Half-way
*NL*
upstairs
he
could
hear
the
noise
and
animated
conversation
of
a
big
*NL*
gathering
of
people
.
The
door
was
wide
open
on
the
stairs
;
he
could
*NL*
hear
exclamations
and
discussion
.
Razumihin
's
room
was
fairly
large
;
the
*NL*
company
consisted
of
fifteen
people
.
Raskolnikov
stopped
in
the
entry
,
*NL*
where
two
of
the
landlady
's
servants
were
busy
behind
a
screen
with
two
*NL*
samovars
,
bottles
,
plates
and
dishes
of
pie
and
savouries
,
brought
up
*NL*
from
the
landlady
's
kitchen
.
Raskolnikov
sent
in
for
Razumihin
.
He
ran
*NL*
out
delighted
.
At
the
first
glance
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
had
a
*NL*
great
deal
to
drink
and
,
though
no
amount
of
liquor
made
Razumihin
quite
*NL*
drunk
,
this
time
he
was
perceptibly
affected
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
Raskolnikov
hastened
to
say
,
``
I
've
only
just
come
to
tell
you
*NL*
you
've
won
your
bet
and
that
no
one
really
knows
what
may
not
happen
to
*NL*
him
.
I
ca
n't
come
in
;
I
am
so
weak
that
I
shall
fall
down
directly
.
And
*NL*
so
good
evening
and
good-bye
!
Come
and
see
me
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
?
I
'll
see
you
home
.
If
you
say
you
're
weak
yourself
,
*NL*
you
must
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
visitors
?
Who
is
the
curly-headed
one
who
has
just
peeped
*NL*
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
Goodness
only
knows
!
Some
friend
of
uncle

,
I
expect
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
he
has
come
without
being
invited
...
I
'll
leave
uncle
with
them
,
he
*NL*
is
an
invaluable
person
,
pity
I
ca
n't
introduce
you
to
him
now
.
But
*NL*
confound
them
all
now
!
They
wo
n't
notice
me
,
and
I
need
a
little
fresh
*NL*
air
,
for
you
've
come
just
in
the
nick
of
time
--
another
two
minutes
and
I
*NL*
should
have
come
to
blows
!
They
are
talking
such
a
lot
of
wild
stuff
...
*NL*
you
simply
ca
n't
imagine
what
men
will
say
!
Though
why
should
n't
you
*NL*
imagine
?
Do
n't
we
talk
nonsense
ourselves
?
And
let
them
...
that
's
the
*NL*
way
to
learn
not
to
!
...
Wait
a
minute
,
I
'll
fetch
Zossimov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zossimov
pounced
upon
Raskolnikov
almost
greedily
;
he
showed
a
special
*NL*
interest
in
him
;
soon
his
face
brightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
go
to
bed
at
once
,
''
he
pronounced
,
examining
the
patient
as
*NL*
far
as
he
could
,
``
and
take
something
for
the
night
.
Will
you
take
it
?
I
*NL*
got
it
ready
some
time
ago
...
a
powder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
,
if
you
like
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
The
powder
was
taken
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
thing
you
are
taking
him
home
,
''
observed
Zossimov
to
*NL*
Razumihin
--
``
we
shall
see
how
he
is
to-morrow
,
to-day
he
's
not
at
all
*NL*
amiss
--
a
considerable
change
since
the
afternoon
.
Live
and
learn
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
Zossimov
whispered
to
me
when
we
were
coming
out
?
''
*NL*
Razumihin
blurted
out
,
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
street
.
``
I
wo
n't
tell
*NL*
you
everything
,
brother
,
because
they
are
such
fools
.
Zossimov
told
me
*NL*
to
talk
freely
to
you
on
the
way
and
get
you
to
talk
freely
to
me
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
I
am
to
tell
him
about
it
,
for
he
's
got
a
notion
in
his
head
*NL*
that
you
are
...
mad
or
close
on
it
.
Only
fancy
!
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
you
've
three
times
the
brains
he
has
;
in
the
second
,
if
you
are
not
mad
,
*NL*
you
need
n't
care
a
hang
that
he
has
got
such
a
wild
idea
;
and
thirdly
,
*NL*
that
piece
of
beef
whose
specialty
is
surgery
has
gone
mad
on
mental
*NL*
diseases
,
and
what
's
brought
him
to
this
conclusion
about
you
was
your
*NL*
conversation
to-day
with
Zametov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zametov
told
you
all
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
he
did
well
.
Now
I
understand
what
it
all
means
and
so
does
*NL*
Zametov
...
Well
,
the
fact
is
,
Rodya
...
the
point
is
...
I
am
a
little
*NL*
drunk
now
...
But
that
's
...
no
matter
...
the
point
is
that
this
*NL*
idea
...
you
understand
?
was
just
being
hatched
in
their
brains
...
you
*NL*
understand
?
That
is
,
no
one
ventured
to
say
it
aloud
,
because
the
idea
*NL*
is
too
absurd
and
especially
since
the
arrest
of
that
painter
,
that
*NL*
bubble
's
burst
and
gone
for
ever
.
But
why
are
they
such
fools
?
I
gave
*NL*
Zametov
a
bit
of
a
thrashing
at
the
time
--
that
's
between
ourselves
,
*NL*
brother
;
please
do
n't
let
out
a
hint
that
you
know
of
it
;
I
've
noticed
*NL*
he
is
a
ticklish
subject
;
it
was
at
Luise
Ivanovna
's
.
But
to-day
,
to-day
*NL*
it
's
all
cleared
up
.
That
Ilya
Petrovitch
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
!
He
*NL*
took
advantage
of
your
fainting
at
the
police
station
,
but
he
is
ashamed
*NL*
of
it
himself
now
;
I
know
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
listened
greedily
.
Razumihin
was
drunk
enough
to
talk
too
*NL*
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fainted
then
because
it
was
so
close
and
the
smell
of
paint
,
''
said
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
need
to
explain
that
!
And
it
was
n't
the
paint
only
:
the
fever
had
*NL*
been
coming
on
for
a
month
;
Zossimov
testifies
to
that
!
But
how
crushed
*NL*
that
boy
is
now
,
you
would
n't
believe
!
'
I
am
not
worth
his
little
*NL*
finger
,

he
says
.
Yours
,
he
means

He
has
good
feelings
at
times
,
*NL*
brother

But
the
lesson
,
the
lesson
you
gave
him
to-day
in
the
Palais
*NL*
de
Cristal
,
that
was
too
good
for
anything
!
You
frightened
him
at
first
,
*NL*
you
know
,
he
nearly
went
into
convulsions
!
You
almost
convinced
*NL*
him
again
of
the
truth
of
all
that
hideous
nonsense
,
and
then
you
*NL*
suddenly
--
put
out
your
tongue
at
him
:
`
There
now
,
what
do
you
make
of
*NL*
it
?
'
It
was
perfect
!
He
is
crushed
,
annihilated
now
!
It
was
masterly
,
by
*NL*
Jove
,
it
's
what
they
deserve
!
Ah
,
that
I
was
n't
there
!
He
was
hoping
to
*NL*
see
you
awfully

Porfiry
,
too
,
wants
to
make
your
acquaintance
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!

he
too

but
why
did
they
put
me
down
as
mad
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
mad

I
must
have
said
too
much

What
struck
him
,
*NL*
you
see
,
was
that
only
that
subject
seemed
to
interest
you
;
now
it
's
*NL*
clear
why
it
did
interest
you

knowing
all
the
circumstances

*NL*
how
that
irritated
you

worked
in
with
your
illness

drunk

*NL*
For
half
a
minute
both
were
silent

``
Listen

Raskolnikov

*NL*
``
What

anxiously

They
were
already
at
the
foot
of
the
last
flight
of
stairs

at
the
level
*NL*
of
the
landlady

door

and
they
could
,
as
a
fact

see
from
below
that

there
was
a
light
in
Raskolnikov

garret

``

in
bed
long
ago
,
*NL*
but
...
I
do
n't
care
!
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
am
coming
with
you
,
we
'll
come
in
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
we
are
going
in
together
,
but
I
want
to
shake
hands
here
and
say
*NL*
good-bye
to
you
here
.
So
give
me
your
hand
,
good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
,
Rodya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
...
come
along
...
you
shall
be
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
mounting
the
stairs
,
and
the
idea
struck
Razumihin
that
*NL*
perhaps
Zossimov
might
be
right
after
all
.
``
Ah
,
I
've
upset
him
with
my
*NL*
chatter
!
''
he
muttered
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
door
they
heard
voices
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Razumihin
.
Raskolnikov
was
the
first
to
open
the
*NL*
door
;
he
flung
it
wide
and
stood
still
in
the
doorway
,
dumbfoundered
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
and
sister
were
sitting
on
his
sofa
and
had
been
waiting
an
*NL*
hour
and
a
half
for
him
.
Why
had
he
never
expected
,
never
thought
of
*NL*
them
,
though
the
news
that
they
had
started
,
were
on
their
way
and
would
*NL*
arrive
immediately
,
had
been
repeated
to
him
only
that
day
?
They
had
*NL*
spent
that
hour
and
a
half
plying
Nastasya
with
questions
.
She
was
*NL*
standing
before
them
and
had
told
them
everything
by
now
.
They
were
*NL*
beside
themselves
with
alarm
when
they
heard
of
his
``
running
away
''
*NL*
to-day
,
ill
and
,
as
they
understood
from
her
story
,
delirious
!
``
Good
*NL*
Heavens
,
what
had
become
of
him
?
''
Both
had
been
weeping
,
both
had
been
*NL*
in
anguish
for
that
hour
and
a
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cry
of
joy
,
of
ecstasy
,
greeted
Raskolnikov
's
entrance
.
Both
rushed
to
*NL*
him
.
But
he
stood
like
one
dead
;
a
sudden
intolerable
sensation
struck
*NL*
him
like
a
thunderbolt
.
He
did
not
lift
his
arms
to
embrace
them
,
he
*NL*
could
not
.
His
mother
and
sister
clasped
him
in
their
arms
,
kissed
him
,
*NL*
laughed
and
cried
.
He
took
a
step
,
tottered
and
fell
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxiety
,
cries
of
horror
,
moans
...
Razumihin
who
was
standing
in
the
*NL*
doorway
flew
into
the
room
,
seized
the
sick
man
in
his
strong
arms
and
*NL*
in
a
moment
had
him
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
nothing
!
''
he
cried
to
the
mother
and
sister
--
``
it
's
only
a
*NL*
faint
,
a
mere
trifle
!
Only
just
now
the
doctor
said
he
was
much
better
,
*NL*
that
he
is
perfectly
well
!
Water
!
See
,
he
is
coming
to
himself
,
he
is
*NL*
all
right
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
seizing
Dounia
by
the
arm
so
that
he
almost
dislocated
it
,
he
made
*NL*
her
bend
down
to
see
that
``
he
is
all
right
again
.
''
The
mother
and
sister
*NL*
looked
on
him
with
emotion
and
gratitude
,
as
their
Providence
.
They
*NL*
had
heard
already
from
Nastasya
all
that
had
been
done
for
their
Rodya
*NL*
during
his
illness
,
by
this
``
very
competent
young
man
,
''
as
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
Raskolnikov
called
him
that
evening
in
conversation
with
*NL*
Dounia
.

PART
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
got
up
,
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
.
He
waved
his
hand
weakly
*NL*
to
Razumihin
to
cut
short
the
flow
of
warm
and
incoherent
consolations
*NL*
he
was
addressing
to
his
mother
and
sister
,
took
them
both
by
the
hand
*NL*
and
for
a
minute
or
two
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
without
speaking
.
*NL*
His
mother
was
alarmed
by
his
expression
.
It
revealed
an
emotion
*NL*
agonisingly
poignant
,
and
at
the
same
time
something
immovable
,
almost
*NL*
insane
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
was
pale
;
her
hand
trembled
in
her
brother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
home
...
with
him
,
''
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
,
pointing
to
Razumihin
,
*NL*
``
good-bye
till
to-morrow
;
to-morrow
everything
...
Is
it
long
since
you
*NL*
arrived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
evening
,
Rodya
,
''
answered
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
``
the
train
was
*NL*
awfully
late
.
But
,
Rodya
,
nothing
would
induce
me
to
leave
you
now
!
I
*NL*
will
spend
the
night
here
,
near
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
torture
me
!
''
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
stay
with
him
,
''
cried
Razumihin
,
``
I
wo
n't
leave
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
Bother
all
my
visitors
!
Let
them
rage
to
their
hearts
'
content
!
*NL*
My
uncle
is
presiding
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
how
can
I
thank
you
!
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
beginning
,
once
*NL*
more
pressing
Razumihin
's
hands
,
but
Raskolnikov
interrupted
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
have
it
!
I
ca
n't
have
it
!
''
he
repeated
irritably
,
``
do
n't
worry
*NL*
me
!
Enough
,
go
away
...
I
ca
n't
stand
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
mamma
,
come
out
of
the
room
at
least
for
a
minute
,
''
Dounia
*NL*
whispered
in
dismay
;
``
we
are
distressing
him
,
that
's
evident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
n't
I
look
at
him
after
three
years
?
''
wept
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
''
he
stopped
them
again
,
``
you
keep
interrupting
me
,
and
my
ideas
*NL*
get
muddled
...
Have
you
seen
Luzhin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Rodya
,
but
he
knows
already
of
our
arrival
.
We
have
heard
,
Rodya
,
*NL*
that
Pyotr
Petrovitch
was
so
kind
as
to
visit
you
today
,
''
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
added
somewhat
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
he
was
so
kind
...
Dounia
,
I
promised
Luzhin
I
'd
throw
him
*NL*
downstairs
and
told
him
to
go
to
hell
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodya
,
what
are
you
saying
!
Surely
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
tell
us
...
''
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
began
in
alarm
,
but
she
stopped
,
looking
at
*NL*
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
was
looking
attentively
at
her
brother
,
waiting
*NL*
for
what
would
come
next
.
Both
of
them
had
heard
of
the
quarrel
from
*NL*
Nastasya
,
so
far
as
she
had
succeeded
in
understanding
and
reporting
it
,
*NL*
and
were
in
painful
perplexity
and
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dounia
,
''
Raskolnikov
continued
with
an
effort
,
``
I
do
n't
want
that
*NL*
marriage
,
so
at
the
first
opportunity
to-morrow
you
must
refuse
Luzhin
,
*NL*
so
that
we
may
never
hear
his
name
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heavens
!
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
think
what
you
are
saying
!
''
Avdotya
Romanovna
began
*NL*
impetuously
,
but
immediately
checked
herself
.
``
You
are
not
fit
to
talk
*NL*
now
,
perhaps
;
you
are
tired
,
''
she
added
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I
am
delirious
?
No
...
You
are
marrying
Luzhin
for
_
my
_
*NL*
sake
.
But
I
wo
n't
accept
the
sacrifice
.
And
so
write
a
letter
before
*NL*
to-morrow
,
to
refuse
him
...
Let
me
read
it
in
the
morning
and
that
will
*NL*
be
the
end
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
ca
n't
do
!
''
the
girl
cried
,
offended
,
``
what
right
have
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dounia
,
you
are
hasty
,
too
,
be
quiet
,
to-morrow
...
Do
n't
you
see
...
''
*NL*
the
mother
interposed
in
dismay
.
``
Better
come
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
raving
,
''
Razumihin
cried
tipsily
,
``
or
how
would
he
dare
!
*NL*
To-morrow
all
this
nonsense
will
be
over
...
to-day
he
certainly
did
*NL*
drive
him
away
.
That
was
so
.
And
Luzhin
got
angry
,
too
...
He
made
*NL*
speeches
here
,
wanted
to
show
off
his
learning
and
he
went
out
*NL*
crest-fallen
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
true
?
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
till
to-morrow
,
brother
,
''
said
Dounia
compassionately
--
``
let
us
*NL*
go
,
mother
...
Good-bye
,
Rodya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
,
sister
,
''
he
repeated
after
them
,
making
a
last
effort
,
*NL*
``
I
am
not
delirious
;
this
marriage
is
--
an
infamy
.
Let
me
act
like
*NL*
a
scoundrel
,
but
you
must
n't
...
one
is
enough
...
and
though
I
am
a
*NL*
scoundrel
,
I
would
n't
own
such
a
sister
.
It
's
me
or
Luzhin
!
Go
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
out
of
your
mind
!
Despot
!
''
roared
Razumihin
;
but
Raskolnikov
*NL*
did
not
and
perhaps
could
not
answer
.
He
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
*NL*
turned
to
the
wall
,
utterly
exhausted
.
Avdotya
Romanovna
looked
with
*NL*
interest
at
Razumihin
;
her
black
eyes
flashed
;
Razumihin
positively
*NL*
started
at
her
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
stood
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
,
''
she
whispered
in
despair
to
Razumihin
.
*NL*
``
I
will
stay
somewhere
here
...
escort
Dounia
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
spoil
everything
,
''
Razumihin
answered
in
the
same
whisper
,
*NL*
losing
patience
--
``
come
out
on
to
the
stairs
,
anyway
.
Nastasya
,
show
a
*NL*
light
!
I
assure
you
,
''
he
went
on
in
a
half
whisper
on
the
stairs
--
``
that
*NL*
he
was
almost
beating
the
doctor
and
me
this
afternoon
!
Do
you
*NL*
understand
?
The
doctor
himself
!
Even
he
gave
way
and
left
him
,
so
as
not
*NL*
to
irritate
him
.
I
remained
downstairs
on
guard
,
but
he
dressed
at
once
*NL*
and
slipped
off
.
And
he
will
slip
off
again
if
you
irritate
him
,
at
this
*NL*
time
of
night
,
and
will
do
himself
some
mischief
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Avdotya
Romanovna
ca
n't
possibly
be
left
in
those
lodgings
without
*NL*
you
.
Just
think
where
you
are
staying
!
That
blackguard
Pyotr
Petrovitch
*NL*
could
n't
find
you
better
lodgings
...
But
you
know
I
've
had
a
little
to
*NL*
drink
,
and
that
's
what
makes
me
...
swear
;
do
n't
mind
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
go
to
the
landlady
here
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
insisted
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
beseech
her
to
find
some
corner
for
Dounia
and
me
for
the
night
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
leave
him
like
that
,
I
can
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
took
place
on
the
landing
just
before
the
landlady
's
*NL*
door
.
Nastasya
lighted
them
from
a
step
below
.
Razumihin
was
in
*NL*
extraordinary
excitement
.
Half
an
hour
earlier
,
while
he
was
bringing
*NL*
Raskolnikov
home
,
he
had
indeed
talked
too
freely
,
but
he
was
aware
of
*NL*
it
himself
,
and
his
head
was
clear
in
spite
of
the
vast
quantities
he
*NL*
had
imbibed
.
Now
he
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
ecstasy
,
and
all
that
he
*NL*
had
drunk
seemed
to
fly
to
his
head
with
redoubled
effect
.
He
stood
with
*NL*
the
two
ladies
,
seizing
both
by
their
hands
,
persuading
them
,
and
giving
*NL*
them
reasons
with
astonishing
plainness
of
speech
,
and
at
almost
every
*NL*
word
he
uttered
,
probably
to
emphasise
his
arguments
,
he
squeezed
their
*NL*
hands
painfully
as
in
a
vise
.
He
stared
at
Avdotya
Romanovna
without
the
*NL*
least
regard
for
good
manners
.
They
sometimes
pulled
their
hands
out
of
*NL*
his
huge
bony
paws
,
but
far
from
noticing
what
was
the
matter
,
he
drew
*NL*
them
all
the
closer
to
him
.
If
they
'd
told
him
to
jump
head
foremost
*NL*
from
the
staircase
,
he
would
have
done
it
without
thought
or
hesitation
*NL*
in
their
service
.
Though
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
felt
that
the
young
man
*NL*
was
really
too
eccentric
and
pinched
her
hand
too
much
,
in
her
anxiety
*NL*
over
her
Rodya
she
looked
on
his
presence
as
providential
,
and
was
*NL*
unwilling
to
notice
all
his
peculiarities
.
But
though
Avdotya
Romanovna
*NL*
shared
her
anxiety
,
and
was
not
of
timorous
disposition
,
she
could
not
*NL*
see
the
glowing
light
in
his
eyes
without
wonder
and
almost
alarm
.
It
*NL*
was
only
the
unbounded
confidence
inspired
by
Nastasya
's
account
of
her
*NL*
brother
's
queer
friend
,
which
prevented
her
from
trying
to
run
away
from
*NL*
him
,
and
to
persuade
her
mother
to
do
the
same
.
She
realised
,
too
,
*NL*
that
even
running
away
was
perhaps
impossible
now
.
Ten
minutes
later
,
*NL*
however
,
she
was
considerably
reassured
;
it
was
characteristic
of
*NL*
Razumihin
that
he
showed
his
true
nature
at
once
,
whatever
mood
he
might
*NL*
be
in
,
so
that
people
quickly
saw
the
sort
of
man
they
had
to
deal
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
go
to
the
landlady
,
that
's
perfect
nonsense
!
''
he
cried
.
``
If
*NL*
you
stay
,
though
you
are
his
mother
,
you
'll
drive
him
to
a
frenzy
,
and
*NL*
then
goodness
knows
what
will
happen
!
Listen
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
*NL*
do
:
Nastasya
will
stay
with
him
now
,
and
I
'll
conduct
you
both
home
,
you
*NL*
ca
n't
be
in
the
streets
alone
;
Petersburg
is
an
awful
place
in
that
*NL*
way
...
But
no
matter
!
Then
I
'll
run
straight
back
here
and
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
later
,
on
my
word
of
honour
,
I
'll
bring
you
news
how
he
is
,
*NL*
whether
he
is
asleep
,
and
all
that
.
Then
,
listen
!
Then
I
'll
run
home
in
*NL*
a
twinkling
--
I
've
a
lot
of
friends
there
,
all
drunk
--
I
'll
fetch
*NL*
Zossimov
--
that
's
the
doctor
who
is
looking
after
him
,
he
is
there
,
too
,
*NL*
but
he
is
not
drunk
;
he
is
not
drunk
,
he
is
never
drunk
!
I
'll
drag
him
*NL*
to
Rodya
,
and
then
to
you
,
so
that
you
'll
get
two
reports
in
the
*NL*
hour
--
from
the
doctor
,
you
understand
,
from
the
doctor
himself
,
that
's
a
*NL*
very
different
thing
from
my
account
of
him
!
If
there
's
anything
wrong
,
*NL*
I
swear
I
'll
bring
you
here
myself
,
but
,
if
it
's
all
right
,
you
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
And
I
'll
spend
the
night
here
,
in
the
passage
,
he
wo
n't
hear
me
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
tell
Zossimov
to
sleep
at
the
landlady
's
,
to
be
at
hand
.
Which
*NL*
is
better
for
him
:
you
or
the
doctor
?
So
come
home
then
!
But
the
*NL*
landlady
is
out
of
the
question
;
it
's
all
right
for
me
,
but
it
's
out
of
*NL*
the
question
for
you
:
she
would
n't
take
you
,
for
she
's
...
for
she
's
a
*NL*
fool
...
She
'd
be
jealous
on
my
account
of
Avdotya
Romanovna
and
of
you
,
*NL*
too
,
if
you
want
to
know
...
of
Avdotya
Romanovna
certainly
.
She
is
an
*NL*
absolutely
,
absolutely
unaccountable
character
!
But
I
am
a
fool
,
too
!
...
*NL*
No
matter
!
Come
along
!
Do
you
trust
me
?
Come
,
do
you
trust
me
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
mother
,
''
said
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
``
he
will
certainly
do
what
*NL*
he
has
promised
.
He
has
saved
Rodya
already
,
and
if
the
doctor
really
*NL*
will
consent
to
spend
the
night
here
,
what
could
be
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
you
...
you
...
understand
me
,
because
you
are
an
angel
!
''
*NL*
Razumihin
cried
in
ecstasy
,
``
let
us
go
!
Nastasya
!
Fly
upstairs
and
sit
*NL*
with
him
with
a
light
;
I
'll
come
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
not
perfectly
convinced
,
she
made
no
*NL*
further
resistance
.
Razumihin
gave
an
arm
to
each
and
drew
them
down
*NL*
the
stairs
.
He
still
made
her
uneasy
,
as
though
he
was
competent
and
*NL*
good-natured
,
was
he
capable
of
carrying
out
his
promise
?
He
seemed
in
*NL*
such
a
condition
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
see
you
think
I
am
in
such
a
condition
!
''
Razumihin
broke
in
upon
*NL*
her
thoughts
,
guessing
them
,
as
he
strolled
along
the
pavement
with
huge
*NL*
steps
,
so
that
the
two
ladies
could
hardly
keep
up
with
him
,
a
fact
he
*NL*
did
not
observe
,
however
.
``
Nonsense
!
That
is
...
I
am
drunk
like
a
fool
,
*NL*
but
that
's
not
it
;
I
am
not
drunk
from
wine
.
It
's
seeing
you
has
turned
*NL*
my
head
...
But
do
n't
mind
me
!
Do
n't
take
any
notice
:
I
am
talking
*NL*
nonsense
,
I
am
not
worthy
of
you
...
I
am
utterly
unworthy
of
you
!
The
*NL*
minute
I
've
taken
you
home
,
I
'll
pour
a
couple
of
pailfuls
of
water
over
*NL*
my
head
in
the
gutter
here
,
and
then
I
shall
be
all
right
...
If
only
*NL*
you
knew
how
I
love
you
both
!
Do
n't
laugh
,
and
do
n't
be
angry
!
You
may
*NL*
be
angry
with
anyone
,
but
not
with
me
!
I
am
his
friend
,
and
therefore
I
*NL*
am
your
friend
,
too
,
I
want
to
be
...
I
had
a
presentiment
...
Last
year
*NL*
there
was
a
moment
...
though
it
was
n't
a
presentiment
really
,
for
*NL*
you
seem
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
.
And
I
expect
I
sha
n't
sleep
all
*NL*
night
...
Zossimov
was
afraid
a
little
time
ago
that
he
would
go
mad
...
*NL*
that
's
why
he
must
n't
be
irritated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
cried
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
the
doctor
really
say
that
?
''
asked
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
's
not
so
,
not
a
bit
of
it
.
He
gave
him
some
medicine
,
a
*NL*
powder
,
I
saw
it
,
and
then
your
coming
here
...
Ah
!
It
would
have
been
*NL*
better
if
you
had
come
to-morrow
.
It
's
a
good
thing
we
went
away
.
And
in
*NL*
an
hour
Zossimov
himself
will
report
to
you
about
everything
.
He
is
not
*NL*
drunk
!
And
I
sha
n't
be
drunk
...
And
what
made
me
get
so
tight
?
Because
*NL*
they
got
me
into
an
argument
,
damn
them
!
I
've
sworn
never
to
argue
!
They
*NL*
talk
such
trash
!
I
almost
came
to
blows
!
I
've
left
my
uncle
to
preside
.
*NL*
Would
you
believe
,
they
insist
on
complete
absence
of
individualism
*NL*
and
that
's
just
what
they
relish
!
Not
to
be
themselves
,
to
be
as
unlike
*NL*
themselves
as
they
can
.
That
's
what
they
regard
as
the
highest
point
of
*NL*
progress
.
If
only
their
nonsense
were
their
own
,
but
as
it
is
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
interrupted
timidly
,
but
it
only
added
*NL*
fuel
to
the
flames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
?
''
shouted
Razumihin
,
louder
than
ever
,
``
you
think
I
*NL*
am
attacking
them
for
talking
nonsense
?
Not
a
bit
!
I
like
them
to
talk
*NL*
nonsense
.
That
's
man
's
one
privilege
over
all
creation
.
Through
error
*NL*
you
come
to
the
truth
!
I
am
a
man
because
I
err
!
You
never
reach
any
*NL*
truth
without
making
fourteen
mistakes
and
very
likely
a
hundred
and
*NL*
fourteen
.
And
a
fine
thing
,
too
,
in
its
way
;
but
we
ca
n't
even
make
*NL*
mistakes
on
our
own
account
!
Talk
nonsense
,
but
talk
your
own
nonsense
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
kiss
you
for
it
.
To
go
wrong
in
one
's
own
way
is
better
than
*NL*
to
go
right
in
someone
else
's

In
the
first
case
you
are
a
man
,
in
the
*NL*
second
you
're
no
better
than
a
bird

Truth
wo
n't
escape
you
,
but
life
*NL*
can
be
cramped
.
There
have
been
examples
.
And
what
are
we
doing
now
?
*NL*
In
science
,
development
,
thought
,
invention
,
ideals
,
aims
,
liberalism
,
*NL*
judgment
,
experience
and
everything
,
everything
,
everything
,
we
are
*NL*
still
in
the
preparatory
class
at
school
.
We
prefer
to
live
on
other
*NL*
people
's
ideas
,
it
's
what
we
are
used
to
!
Am
I
right
,
am
I
right

cried
*NL*
Razumihin
,
pressing
and
shaking
the
two
ladies
'
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

mercy
,
I
do

cried
poor
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

though
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
in
everything

added
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
earnestly
and
at
once
uttered
a
cry
,
for
he
squeezed
her
hand
*NL*
so
painfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
say
yes

well
after

he
cried
in
*NL*
a
transport
,
``
you

*NL*
perfection

Give

I
want
to
kiss
*NL*
your

here
at
once

on

and
he
fell
on
his
knees
on
the
*NL*
pavement
,
fortunately
at
that
time
deserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off

I
entreat
you

what
are
you
doing
?

Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
*NL*
cried
,
greatly
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
,
get
up
!
''
said
Dounia
laughing
,
though
she
,
too
,
was
upset
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
anything

you
let
me
kiss
your

That
's
it

Enough

up

I

I

unworthy

drunk

and
I

I
am
not
worthy

to
do

homage

the
duty

done
homage

Here

Rodya

right

driving
your
Pyotr

away

How

how

are

Yes

Well
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you

your

is
a
*NL*
scoundrel

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me

Mr.

are
forgetting

Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
*NL*
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

you
are
right

I
did
forget
myself

I
am
ashamed
of
it

*NL*
Razumihin
made
haste
to
apologise
.
``
But
...
but
you
ca
n't
be
angry
with
*NL*
me
for
speaking
so

For
I
speak
sincerely

not

*NL*
That

disgraceful

in

Well

But
we
all
saw
to-day
when
he
*NL*
came
in
that
that
man
is
not

Not
because
he
had
his
hair

curled
at
the
barber
's
,
not
because
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
show
his
*NL*
wit
,
but
because
he
is
a
spy
,
a
speculator
,
because
he
is
a
skin-flint

a
buffoon

That
's
evident

Do
you
think
him
clever

No

fool

a
fool

And
is
he
a
match

Good
heavens

Do
you
see

ladies

he
stopped
suddenly
on
the
way
upstairs
to
their
rooms
,
``
though
*NL*
all
my

there
are
drunk

talk

and
I
do

too

yet
we
shall
talk
our

we
are
on

Pyotr

I
do
respect

though

Zametov

eight

lock

half
an

came
into

not

said
the
mother

looking
timidly
at
her

*NL*
trying
to
read
her
thoughts
and
,
already
half
consoled
by
Dounia

*NL*
standing
up
for
her
brother

meant
that

had
already
forgiven

him

think
better

her
further

Avdotya
Romanovna
said
finally

And
,
of
course

there
was
no
going
*NL*
beyond
that
,
for
this
was
a
point
which
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
*NL*
afraid
to
discuss

Dounia
went
up
and
kissed
her
mother
.
The
latter
*NL*
warmly
embraced
her
without
speaking

Then
she
sat
down
to
wait
*NL*
anxiously
for
Razumihin

return

timidly
watching
her
daughter
who
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
arms
folded
,
lost
in
thought
.
*NL*
This
walking
up
and
down
when
she
was
thinking
was
a
habit
of
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
's
and
the
mother
was
always
afraid
to
break
in
on
her
*NL*
daughter
's
mood
at
such
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
,
of
course
,
was
ridiculous
in
his
sudden
drunken
infatuation
*NL*
for
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
Yet
apart
from
his
eccentric
condition
,
many
*NL*
people
would
have
thought
it
justified
if
they
had
seen
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
,
especially
at
that
moment
when
she
was
walking
to
and
*NL*
fro
with
folded
arms
,
pensive
and
melancholy
.
Avdotya
Romanovna
was
*NL*
remarkably
good-looking
;
she
was
tall
,
strikingly
well-proportioned
,
*NL*
strong
and
self-reliant
--
the
latter
quality
was
apparent
in
every
*NL*
gesture
,
though
it
did
not
in
the
least
detract
from
the
grace
and
*NL*
softness
of
her
movements
.
In
face
she
resembled
her
brother
,
but
she
*NL*
might
be
described
as
really
beautiful
.
Her
hair
was
dark
brown
,
a
*NL*
little
lighter
than
her
brother
's
;
there
was
a
proud
light
in
her
almost
*NL*
black
eyes
and
yet
at
times
a
look
of
extraordinary
kindness
.
She
was
*NL*
pale
,
but
it
was
a
healthy
pallor
;
her
face
was
radiant
with
freshness
*NL*
and
vigour
.
Her
mouth
was
rather
small
;
the
full
red
lower
lip
projected
*NL*
a
little
as
did
her
chin
;
it
was
the
only
irregularity
in
her
beautiful
*NL*
face
,
but
it
gave
it
a
peculiarly
individual
and
almost
haughty
*NL*
expression
.
Her
face
was
always
more
serious
and
thoughtful
than
gay
;
*NL*
but
how
well
smiles
,
how
well
youthful
,
lighthearted
,
irresponsible
,
*NL*
laughter
suited
her
face
!
It
was
natural
enough
that
a
warm
,
open
,
*NL*
simple-hearted
,
honest
giant
like
Razumihin
,
who
had
never
seen
anyone
*NL*
like
her
and
was
not
quite
sober
at
the
time
,
should
lose
his
head
*NL*
immediately
.
Besides
,
as
chance
would
have
it
,
he
saw
Dounia
for
the
*NL*
first
time
transfigured
by
her
love
for
her
brother
and
her
joy
at
*NL*
meeting
him
.
Afterwards
he
saw
her
lower
lip
quiver
with
indignation
*NL*
at
her
brother
's
insolent
,
cruel
and
ungrateful
words
--
and
his
fate
was
*NL*
sealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
the
truth
,
moreover
,
when
he
blurted
out
in
his
drunken
*NL*
talk
on
the
stairs
that
Praskovya
Pavlovna
,
Raskolnikov
's
eccentric
*NL*
landlady
,
would
be
jealous
of
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
as
well
as
of
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
on
his
account
.
Although
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
*NL*
forty-three
,
her
face
still
retained
traces
of
her
former
beauty
;
she
*NL*
looked
much
younger
than
her
age
,
indeed
,
which
is
almost
always
the
*NL*
case
with
women
who
retain
serenity
of
spirit
,
sensitiveness
and
pure
*NL*
sincere
warmth
of
heart
to
old
age
.
We
may
add
in
parenthesis
that
to
*NL*
preserve
all
this
is
the
only
means
of
retaining
beauty
to
old
age
.
Her
*NL*
hair
had
begun
to
grow
grey
and
thin
,
there
had
long
been
little
crow
's
*NL*
foot
wrinkles
round
her
eyes
,
her
cheeks
were
hollow
and
sunken
from
*NL*
anxiety
and
grief
,
and
yet
it
was
a
handsome
face
.
She
was
Dounia
*NL*
over
again
,
twenty
years
older
,
but
without
the
projecting
underlip
.
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
emotional
,
but
not
sentimental
,
timid
and
*NL*
yielding
,
but
only
to
a
certain
point
.
She
could
give
way
and
accept
a
*NL*
great
deal
even
of
what
was
contrary
to
her
convictions
,
but
there
was
a
*NL*
certain
barrier
fixed
by
honesty
,
principle
and
the
deepest
convictions
*NL*
which
nothing
would
induce
her
to
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exactly
twenty
minutes
after
Razumihin
's
departure
,
there
came
two
*NL*
subdued
but
hurried
knocks
at
the
door
:
he
had
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
come
in
,
I
have
n't
time
,
''
he
hastened
to
say
when
the
door
was
*NL*
opened
.
``
He
sleeps
like
a
top
,
soundly
,
quietly
,
and
God
grant
he
may
*NL*
sleep
ten
hours
.
Nastasya
's
with
him
;
I
told
her
not
to
leave
till
I
*NL*
came
.
Now
I
am
fetching
Zossimov
,
he
will
report
to
you
and
then
you
'd
*NL*
better
turn
in
;
I
can
see
you
are
too
tired
to
do
anything
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
ran
off
down
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
very
competent
and
...
devoted
young
man
!
''
cried
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
exceedingly
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
a
splendid
person
!
''
Avdotya
Romanovna
replied
with
some
*NL*
warmth
,
resuming
her
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
an
hour
later
when
they
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
*NL*
and
another
knock
at
the
door
.
Both
women
waited
this
time
completely
*NL*
relying
on
Razumihin
's
promise
;
he
actually
had
succeeded
in
bringing
*NL*
Zossimov
.
Zossimov
had
agreed
at
once
to
desert
the
drinking
party
to
*NL*
go
to
Raskolnikov
's
,
but
he
came
reluctantly
and
with
the
greatest
*NL*
suspicion
to
see
the
ladies
,
mistrusting
Razumihin
in
his
exhilarated
*NL*
condition
.
But
his
vanity
was
at
once
reassured
and
flattered
;
he
saw
*NL*
that
they
were
really
expecting
him
as
an
oracle
.
He
stayed
just
ten
*NL*
minutes
and
succeeded
in
completely
convincing
and
comforting
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
.
He
spoke
with
marked
sympathy
,
but
with
the
reserve
and
*NL*
extreme
seriousness
of
a
young
doctor
at
an
important
consultation
.
*NL*
He
did
not
utter
a
word
on
any
other
subject
and
did
not
display
the
*NL*
slightest
desire
to
enter
into
more
personal
relations
with
the
two
*NL*
ladies
.
Remarking
at
his
first
entrance
the
dazzling
beauty
of
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
,
he
endeavoured
not
to
notice
her
at
all
during
his
visit
and
*NL*
addressed
himself
solely
to
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
All
this
gave
him
*NL*
extraordinary
inward
satisfaction
.
He
declared
that
he
thought
the
*NL*
invalid
at
this
moment
going
on
very
satisfactorily
.
According
to
his
*NL*
observations
the
patient
's
illness
was
due
partly
to
his
unfortunate
*NL*
material
surroundings
during
the
last
few
months
,
but
it
had
partly
also
*NL*
a
moral
origin
,
``
was
,
so
to
speak
,
the
product
of
several
material
and
*NL*
moral
influences
,
anxieties
,
apprehensions
,
troubles
,
certain
ideas
...
*NL*
and
so
on
.
''
Noticing
stealthily
that
Avdotya
Romanovna
was
following
his
*NL*
words
with
close
attention
,
Zossimov
allowed
himself
to
enlarge
on
this
*NL*
theme
.
On
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
's
anxiously
and
timidly
inquiring
as
*NL*
to
``
some
suspicion
of
insanity
,
''
he
replied
with
a
composed
and
candid
*NL*
smile
that
his
words
had
been
exaggerated
;
that
certainly
the
patient
*NL*
had
some
fixed
idea
,
something
approaching
a
monomania
--
he
,
Zossimov
,
*NL*
was
now
particularly
studying
this
interesting
branch
of
medicine
--
but
*NL*
that
it
must
be
recollected
that
until
to-day
the
patient
had
been
in
*NL*
delirium
and
...
and
that
no
doubt
the
presence
of
his
family
would
have
*NL*
a
favourable
effect
on
his
recovery
and
distract
his
mind
,
``
if
only
all
*NL*
fresh
shocks
can
be
avoided
,
''
he
added
significantly
.
Then
he
got
up
,
*NL*
took
leave
with
an
impressive
and
affable
bow
,
while
blessings
,
warm
*NL*
gratitude
,
and
entreaties
were
showered
upon
him
,
and
Avdotya
Romanovna
*NL*
spontaneously
offered
her
hand
to
him
.
He
went
out
exceedingly
pleased
*NL*
with
his
visit
and
still
more
so
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
talk
to-morrow
;
go
to
bed
at
once
!
''
Razumihin
said
in
conclusion
,
*NL*
following
Zossimov
out
.
``
I
'll
be
with
you
to-morrow
morning
as
early
as
*NL*
possible
with
my
report
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fetching
little
girl
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
''
remarked
Zossimov
,
*NL*
almost
licking
his
lips
as
they
both
came
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetching
?
You
said
fetching
?
''
roared
Razumihin
and
he
flew
at
Zossimov
*NL*
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
.
``
If
you
ever
dare
...
Do
you
understand
?
*NL*
Do
you
understand
?
''
he
shouted
,
shaking
him
by
the
collar
and
squeezing
*NL*
him
against
the
wall
.
``
Do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
,
you
drunken
devil
,
''
said
Zossimov
,
struggling
and
when
he
*NL*
had
let
him
go
,
he
stared
at
him
and
went
off
into
a
sudden
guffaw
.
*NL*
Razumihin
stood
facing
him
in
gloomy
and
earnest
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
am
an
ass
,
''
he
observed
,
sombre
as
a
storm
cloud
,
``
but
*NL*
still
...
you
are
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
brother
,
not
at
all
such
another
.
I
am
not
dreaming
of
any
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
in
silence
and
only
when
they
were
close
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
lodgings
,
Razumihin
broke
the
silence
in
considerable
*NL*
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
're
a
first-rate
fellow
,
but
among
your
other
*NL*
failings
,
you
're
a
loose
fish
,
that
I
know
,
and
a
dirty
one
,
too
.
You
*NL*
are
a
feeble
,
nervous
wretch
,
and
a
mass
of
whims
,
you
're
getting
fat
*NL*
and
lazy
and
ca
n't
deny
yourself
anything
--
and
I
call
that
dirty
because
*NL*
it
leads
one
straight
into
the
dirt
.
You
've
let
yourself
get
so
slack
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
you
are
still
a
good
,
even
a
devoted
doctor
.
*NL*
You
--
a
doctor
--
sleep
on
a
feather
bed
and
get
up
at
night
to
your
*NL*
patients
!
In
another
three
or
four
years
you
wo
n't
get
up
for
your
*NL*
patients

But
hang
it
all
,
that
's
not
the
point

...
You
are
going
*NL*
to
spend
to-night
in
the
landlady
's
flat
here

-LRB-
Hard
work
I
've
had
to
*NL*
persuade
her
!
-RRB-
And
I
'll
be
in
the
kitchen
.
So
here
's
a
chance
for
you
to
*NL*
get
to
know
her
better
...
It
's
not
as
you
think
!
There
's
not
a
trace

*NL*
anything

the
sort

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
have
modesty

bashfulness

virtue

sighing

simply
melting

Save

by
all

unholy

She

prepossessing

do
anything

*NL*
*NL*
Zossimov
laughed
more
violently
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
smitten
!
But
what
am
I
to
do
with
her
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

I

She

I
have

She

Then

I

But
she

whether
it

so
long
as
somebody
*NL*
sits
beside

sighing

I

*NL*
look
here

you
are
good
at
mathematics

working
at

begin

to

will
gaze
at

I
talked
to

at

time

about
the
Prussian
House
of
Lords
-LRB-
for
one
must
talk

something

she
*NL*
just
sighed

perspired

And
you
must
n't
talk
of
love

she
's
bashful
*NL*
to
hysterics
--
but
just
let
her
see
you
ca
n't
tear
yourself
away
--
that
's
*NL*
enough
.
It
's
fearfully
comfortable
;
you
're
quite
at
home
,
you
can
*NL*
read
,
sit

lie
about

You
may
even
venture
on
a
kiss

if
you
're
*NL*
careful

But
what

Listen

I

up

there

you

just
look
in

too

notice

wake
me
at

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
waked
up
next
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
troubled
and
serious
.
*NL*
He
found
himself
confronted
with
many
new
and
unlooked-for
perplexities
.
*NL*
He
had
never
expected
that
he
would
ever
wake
up
feeling
like
that
.
He
*NL*
remembered
every
detail
of
the
previous
day
and
he
knew
that
a
perfectly
*NL*
novel
experience
had
befallen
him
,
that
he
had
received
an
impression
*NL*
unlike
anything
he
had
known
before
.
At
the
same
time
he
recognised
*NL*
clearly
that
the
dream
which
had
fired
his
imagination
was
hopelessly
*NL*
unattainable
--
so
unattainable
that
he
felt
positively
ashamed
of
it
,
and
*NL*
he
hastened
to
pass
to
the
other
more
practical
cares
and
difficulties
*NL*
bequeathed
him
by
that
``
thrice
accursed
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
awful
recollection
of
the
previous
day
was
the
way
he
had
shown
*NL*
himself
``
base
and
mean
,
''
not
only
because
he
had
been
drunk
,
but
*NL*
because
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
young
girl
's
position
to
abuse
*NL*
her
_
fiance
_
in
his
stupid
jealousy
,
knowing
nothing
of
their
mutual
*NL*
relations
and
obligations
and
next
to
nothing
of
the
man
himself
.
And
*NL*
what
right
had
he
to
criticise
him
in
that
hasty
and
unguarded
manner
?
*NL*
Who
had
asked
for
his
opinion
?
Was
it
thinkable
that
such
a
creature
as
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
would
be
marrying
an
unworthy
man
for
money
?
So
there
*NL*
must
be
something
in
him
.
The
lodgings
?
But
after
all
how
could
he
know
*NL*
the
character
of
the
lodgings
?
He
was
furnishing
a
flat
...
Foo
!
how
*NL*
despicable
it
all
was
!
And
what
justification
was
it
that
he
was
drunk
?
*NL*
Such
a
stupid
excuse
was
even
more
degrading
!
In
wine
is
truth
,
and
the
*NL*
truth
had
all
come
out
,
``
that
is
,
all
the
uncleanness
of
his
coarse
*NL*
and
envious
heart
''
!
And
would
such
a
dream
ever
be
permissible
to
*NL*
him
,
Razumihin
?
What
was
he
beside
such
a
girl
--
he
,
the
drunken
noisy
*NL*
braggart
of
last
night
?
Was
it
possible
to
imagine
so
absurd
and
cynical
*NL*
a
juxtaposition
?
Razumihin
blushed
desperately
at
the
very
idea
and
*NL*
suddenly
the
recollection
forced
itself
vividly
upon
him
of
how
he
had
*NL*
said
last
night
on
the
stairs
that
the
landlady
would
be
jealous
of
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
...
that
was
simply
intolerable
.
He
brought
his
fist
*NL*
down
heavily
on
the
kitchen
stove
,
hurt
his
hand
and
sent
one
of
the
*NL*
bricks
flying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
a
minute
later
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
self-abasement
,
``
of
course
,
all
these
infamies
can
never
be
wiped
out
or
*NL*
smoothed
over
...
and
so
it
's
useless
even
to
think
of
it
,
and
I
must
*NL*
go
to
them
in
silence
and
do
my
duty
...
in
silence
,
too
...
and
not
ask
*NL*
forgiveness
,
and
say
nothing
...
for
all
is
lost
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
as
he
dressed
he
examined
his
attire
more
carefully
than
usual
.
*NL*
He
had
n't
another
suit
--
if
he
had
had
,
perhaps
he
would
n't
have
put
it
*NL*
on
.
``
I
would
have
made
a
point
of
not
putting
it
on
.
''
But
in
any
case
he
*NL*
could
not
remain
a
cynic
and
a
dirty
sloven
;
he
had
no
right
to
offend
*NL*
the
feelings
of
others
,
especially
when
they
were
in
need
of
his
*NL*
assistance
and
asking
him
to
see
them
.
He
brushed
his
clothes
carefully
.
*NL*
His
linen
was
always
decent
;
in
that
respect
he
was
especially
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
washed
that
morning
scrupulously
--
he
got
some
soap
from
Nastasya
--
he
*NL*
washed
his
hair
,
his
neck
and
especially
his
hands
.
When
it
came
to
the
*NL*
question
whether
to
shave
his
stubbly
chin
or
not
-LRB-
Praskovya
Pavlovna
*NL*
had
capital
razors
that
had
been
left
by
her
late
husband
-RRB-
,
the
question
*NL*
was
angrily
answered
in
the
negative
.
``
Let
it
stay
as
it
is
!
What
if
*NL*
they
think
that
I
shaved
on
purpose
to
...
?
They
certainly
would
think
*NL*
so
!
Not
on
any
account
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
...
the
worst
of
it
was
he
was
so
coarse
,
so
dirty
,
he
had
the
*NL*
manners
of
a
pothouse
;
and
...
and
even
admitting
that
he
knew
he
had
*NL*
some
of
the
essentials
of
a
gentleman
...
what
was
there
in
that
to
be
*NL*
proud
of
?
Everyone
ought
to
be
a
gentleman
and
more
than
that
...
and
all
*NL*
the
same
-LRB-
he
remembered
-RRB-
he
,
too
,
had
done
little
things
...
not
exactly
*NL*
dishonest
,
and
yet
...
And
what
thoughts
he
sometimes
had
;
hm
...
and
to
*NL*
set
all
that
beside
Avdotya
Romanovna
!
Confound
it
!
So
be
it
!
Well
,
he
'd
*NL*
make
a
point
then
of
being
dirty
,
greasy
,
pothouse
in
his
manners
and
he
*NL*
would
n't
care
!
He
'd
be
worse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
engaged
in
such
monologues
when
Zossimov
,
who
had
spent
the
night
*NL*
in
Praskovya
Pavlovna
's
parlour
,
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
home
and
was
in
a
hurry
to
look
at
the
invalid
first
.
*NL*
Razumihin
informed
him
that
Raskolnikov
was
sleeping
like
a
dormouse
.
*NL*
Zossimov
gave
orders
that
they
should
n't
wake
him
and
promised
to
see
*NL*
him
again
about
eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
still
at
home
,
''
he
added
.
``
Damn
it
all
!
If
one
ca
n't
control
*NL*
one
's
patients
,
how
is
one
to
cure
them
?
Do
you
know
whether
_
he
_
will
*NL*
go
to
them
,
or
whether
_
they
_
are
coming
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
coming
,
I
think
,
''
said
Razumihin
,
understanding
the
object
*NL*
of
the
question
,
``
and
they
will
discuss
their
family
affairs
,
no
doubt
.
*NL*
I
'll
be
off
.
You
,
as
the
doctor
,
have
more
right
to
be
here
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
a
father
confessor
;
I
shall
come
and
go
away
;
I
've
plenty
*NL*
to
do
besides
looking
after
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
worries
me
,
''
interposed
Razumihin
,
frowning
.
``
On
the
way
home
*NL*
I
talked
a
lot
of
drunken
nonsense
to
him
...
all
sorts
of
things
...
and
*NL*
amongst
them
that
you
were
afraid
that
he
...
might
become
insane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
the
ladies
so
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
was
stupid
!
You
may
beat
me
if
you
like
!
Did
you
think
so
*NL*
seriously
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nonsense
,
I
tell
you
,
how
could
I
think
it
seriously
?
You
,
*NL*
yourself
,
described
him
as
a
monomaniac
when
you
fetched
me
to
*NL*
him
...
and
we
added
fuel
to
the
fire
yesterday
,
you
did
,
that
is
,
with
*NL*
your
story
about
the
painter
;
it
was
a
nice
conversation
,
when
he
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
mad
on
that
very
point
!
If
only
I
'd
known
what
happened
then
*NL*
at
the
police
station
and
that
some
wretch
...
had
insulted
him
with
this
*NL*
suspicion
!
Hm
...
I
would
not
have
allowed
that
conversation
yesterday
.
*NL*
These
monomaniacs
will
make
a
mountain
out
of
a
mole-hill
...
and
*NL*
see
their
fancies
as
solid
realities
...
As
far
as
I
remember
,
it
was
*NL*
Zametov
's
story
that
cleared
up
half
the
mystery
,
to
my
mind
.
Why
,
I
*NL*
know
one
case
in
which
a
hypochondriac
,
a
man
of
forty
,
cut
the
throat
*NL*
of
a
little
boy
of
eight
,
because
he
could
n't
endure
the
jokes
he
made
*NL*
every
day
at
table
!
And
in
this
case
his
rags
,
the
insolent
police
*NL*
officer
,
the
fever
and
this
suspicion
!
All
that
working
upon
a
man
half
*NL*
frantic
with
hypochondria
,
and
with
his
morbid
exceptional
vanity
!
That
*NL*
may
well
have
been
the
starting-point
of
illness
.
Well
,
bother
it
*NL*
all
!
...
And
,
by
the
way
,
that
Zametov
certainly
is
a
nice
fellow
,
but
*NL*
hm
...
he
should
n't
have
told
all
that
last
night
.
He
is
an
awful
*NL*
chatterbox
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
whom
did
he
tell
it
to
?
You
and
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Porfiry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
by
the
way
,
have
you
any
influence
on
them
,
his
mother
and
sister
?
*NL*
Tell
them
to
be
more
careful
with
him
to-day
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
get
on
all
right
!
''
Razumihin
answered
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
he
so
set
against
this
Luzhin
?
A
man
with
money
and
she
does
n't
*NL*
seem
to
dislike
him
...
and
they
have
n't
a
farthing
,
I
suppose
?
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
business
is
it
of
yours
?
''
Razumihin
cried
with
annoyance
.
``
How
*NL*
can
I
tell
whether
they
've
a
farthing
?
Ask
them
yourself
and
perhaps
*NL*
you
'll
find
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Foo

what
an
ass
you
are
sometimes

Last
night
's
wine
has
not
gone
off
*NL*
yet

Good-bye
;
thank
your
Praskovya
Pavlovna
from
me
for
my
night
's
*NL*
lodging
.
She
locked
herself
in
,
made
no
reply
to
my
_
bonjour
_
through
*NL*
the
door
;
she
was
up
at
seven
o'clock
,
the
samovar
was
taken
into
her
*NL*
from
the
kitchen
.
I
was
not
vouchsafed
a
personal
interview
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
precisely
Razumihin
reached
the
lodgings
at
Bakaleyev
's
*NL*
house
.
Both
ladies
were
waiting
for
him
with
nervous
impatience
.
They
*NL*
had
risen
at
seven
o'clock
or
earlier
.
He
entered
looking
as
black
as
*NL*
night
,
bowed
awkwardly
and
was
at
once
furious
with
himself
for
it
.
He
*NL*
had
reckoned
without
his
host
:
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
fairly
rushed
at
*NL*
him
,
seized
him
by
both
hands
and
was
almost
kissing
them
.
He
glanced
*NL*
timidly
at
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
but
her
proud
countenance
wore
at
that
*NL*
moment
an
expression
of
such
gratitude
and
friendliness
,
such
*NL*
complete
and
unlooked-for
respect
-LRB-
in
place
of
the
sneering
looks
and
*NL*
ill-disguised
contempt
he
had
expected
-RRB-
,
that
it
threw
him
into
greater
*NL*
confusion
than
if
he
had
been
met
with
abuse
.
Fortunately
there
was
a
*NL*
subject
for
conversation
,
and
he
made
haste
to
snatch
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
everything
was
going
well
and
that
Rodya
had
not
yet
waked
,
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
declared
that
she
was
glad
to
hear
it
,
because
*NL*
``
she
had
something
which
it
was
very
,
very
necessary
to
talk
over
*NL*
beforehand
.
''
Then
followed
an
inquiry
about
breakfast
and
an
invitation
*NL*
to
have
it
with
them
;
they
had
waited
to
have
it
with
him
.
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
rang
the
bell
:
it
was
answered
by
a
ragged
dirty
waiter
,
and
*NL*
they
asked
him
to
bring
tea
which
was
served
at
last
,
but
in
such
*NL*
a
dirty
and
disorderly
way
that
the
ladies
were
ashamed
.
Razumihin
*NL*
vigorously
attacked
the
lodgings
,
but
,
remembering
Luzhin
,
stopped
*NL*
in
embarrassment
and
was
greatly
relieved
by
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
's
*NL*
questions
,
which
showered
in
a
continual
stream
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
,
being
constantly
interrupted
*NL*
by
their
questions
,
and
succeeded
in
describing
to
them
all
the
*NL*
most
important
facts
he
knew
of
the
last
year
of
Raskolnikov
's
life
,
*NL*
concluding
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
his
illness
.
He
omitted
,
*NL*
however
,
many
things
,
which
were
better
omitted
,
including
the
scene
at
*NL*
the
police
station
with
all
its
consequences
.
They
listened
eagerly
*NL*
to
his
story
,
and
,
when
he
thought
he
had
finished
and
satisfied
his
*NL*
listeners
,
he
found
that
they
considered
he
had
hardly
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
tell
me
!
What
do
you
think
...
?
Excuse
me
,
I
still
do
n't
know
*NL*
your
name
!
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
put
in
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
Prokofitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
very
,
very
much

Prokofitch

always

irritable

are

hopes

so

``

can
he
answer
all
that
at

observed
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
I
had
not
expected
to
find
him
in
the
least
like
this
,
*NL*
Dmitri
Prokofitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,
''
answered
Razumihin
.
``
I
have
no
mother
,
but
my
uncle
comes
*NL*
every
year
and
almost
every
time
he
can
scarcely
recognise
me
,
even
in
*NL*
appearance
,
though
he
is
a
clever
man
;
and
your
three
years
'
separation
*NL*
means
a
great
deal
.
What
am
I
to
tell
you
?
I
have
known
Rodion
for
*NL*
a
year
and
a
half
;
he
is
morose
,
gloomy
,
proud
and
haughty
,
and
of
*NL*
late
--
and
perhaps
for
a
long
time
before
--
he
has
been
suspicious
and
*NL*
fanciful
.
He
has
a
noble
nature
and
a
kind
heart
.
He
does
not
like
*NL*
showing
his
feelings
and
would
rather
do
a
cruel
thing
than
open
his
*NL*
heart
freely
.
Sometimes
,
though
,
he
is
not
at
all
morbid
,
but
simply
*NL*
cold
and
inhumanly
callous
;
it
's
as
though
he
were
alternating
between
*NL*
two
characters
.
Sometimes
he
is
fearfully
reserved
!
He
says
he
is
*NL*
so
busy
that
everything
is
a
hindrance
,
and
yet
he
lies
in
bed
doing
*NL*
nothing
.
He
does
n't
jeer
at
things
,
not
because
he
has
n't
the
wit
,
but
*NL*
as
though
he
had
n't
time
to
waste
on
such
trifles
.
He
never
listens
*NL*
to
what
is
said
to
him
.
He
is
never
interested
in
what
interests
other
*NL*
people
at
any
given
moment
.
He
thinks
very
highly
of
himself
and
perhaps
*NL*
he
is
right
.
Well
,
what
more
?
I
think
your
arrival
will
have
a
most
*NL*
beneficial
influence
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
may
,
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
distressed
by
*NL*
Razumihin
's
account
of
her
Rodya
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Razumihin
ventured
to
look
more
boldly
at
Avdotya
Romanovna
at
last
.
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
often
while
he
was
talking
,
but
only
for
a
moment
and
*NL*
looked
away
again
at
once
.
Avdotya
Romanovna
sat
at
the
table
,
listening
*NL*
attentively
,
then
got
up
again
and
began
walking
to
and
fro
with
her
*NL*
arms
folded
and
her
lips
compressed
,
occasionally
putting
in
a
question
,
*NL*
without
stopping
her
walk
.
She
had
the
same
habit
of
not
listening
to
*NL*
what
was
said
.
She
was
wearing
a
dress
of
thin
dark
stuff
and
she
had
a
*NL*
white
transparent
scarf
round
her
neck
.
Razumihin
soon
detected
signs
of
*NL*
extreme
poverty
in
their
belongings
.
Had
Avdotya
Romanovna
been
dressed
*NL*
like
a
queen
,
he
felt
that
he
would
not
be
afraid
of
her
,
but
perhaps
*NL*
just
because
she
was
poorly
dressed
and
that
he
noticed
all
the
misery
*NL*
of
her
surroundings
,
his
heart
was
filled
with
dread
and
he
began
to
be
*NL*
afraid
of
every
word
he
uttered
,
every
gesture
he
made
,
which
was
very
*NL*
trying
for
a
man
who
already
felt
diffident
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
told
us
a
great
deal
that
is
interesting
about
my
brother
's
*NL*
character
...
and
have
told
it
impartially
.
I
am
glad
.
I
thought
that
you
*NL*
were
too
uncritically
devoted
to
him
,
''
observed
Avdotya
Romanovna
with
*NL*
a
smile
.
``
I
think
you
are
right
that
he
needs
a
woman
's
care
,
''
she
added
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
so
;
but
I
daresay
you
are
right
,
only
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
loves
no
one
and
perhaps
he
never
will
,
''
Razumihin
declared
*NL*
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
he
is
not
capable
of
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
you
are
awfully
like
your
brother
,
in
*NL*
everything
,
indeed
!
''
he
blurted
out
suddenly
to
his
own
surprise
,
but
*NL*
remembering
at
once
what
he
had
just
before
said
of
her
brother
,
*NL*
he
turned
as
red
as
a
crab
and
was
overcome
with
confusion
.
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
could
n't
help
laughing
when
she
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
both
be
mistaken
about
Rodya
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
remarked
,
*NL*
slightly
piqued
.
``
I
am
not
talking
of
our
present
difficulty
,
Dounia
.
*NL*
What
Pyotr
Petrovitch
writes
in
this
letter
and
what
you
and
I
have
*NL*
supposed
may
be
mistaken
,
but
you
ca
n't
imagine
,
Dmitri
Prokofitch
,
how
*NL*
moody
and
,
so
to
say
,
capricious
he
is
.
I
never
could
depend
on
what
*NL*
he
would
do
when
he
was
only
fifteen
.
And
I
am
sure
that
he
might
*NL*
do
something
now
that
nobody
else
would
think
of
doing
...
Well
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
do
you
know
how
a
year
and
a
half
ago
he
astounded
me
and
gave
*NL*
me
a
shock
that
nearly
killed
me
,
when
he
had
the
idea
of
marrying
that
*NL*
girl
--
what
was
her
name
--
his
landlady
's
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
about
that
affair
?
''
asked
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
--
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
continued
warmly
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
suppose
that
my
tears
,
my
entreaties
,
my
illness
,
my
possible
death
from
*NL*
grief
,
our
poverty
would
have
made
him
pause
?
No
,
he
would
calmly
have
*NL*
disregarded
all
obstacles
.
And
yet
it
is
n't
that
he
does
n't
love
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
never
spoken
a
word
of
that
affair
to
me
,
''
Razumihin
answered
*NL*
cautiously
.
``
But
I
did
hear
something
from
Praskovya
Pavlovna
herself
,
*NL*
though
she
is
by
no
means
a
gossip
.
And
what
I
heard
certainly
was
*NL*
rather
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
hear
?
''
both
the
ladies
asked
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
nothing
very
special
.
I
only
learned
that
the
marriage
,
which
*NL*
only
failed
to
take
place
through
the
girl
's
death
,
was
not
at
all
to
*NL*
Praskovya
Pavlovna
's
liking
.
They
say
,
too
,
the
girl
was
not
at
all
*NL*
pretty
,
in
fact
I
am
told
positively
ugly
...
and
such
an
invalid
...
and
*NL*
queer
.
But
she
seems
to
have
had
some
good
qualities
.
She
must
have
*NL*
had
some
good
qualities
or
it
's
quite
inexplicable
...
She
had
no
money
*NL*
either
and
he
would
n't
have
considered
her
money
...
But
it
's
always
*NL*
difficult
to
judge
in
such
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
was
a
good
girl
,
''
Avdotya
Romanovna
observed
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forgive
me
,
I
simply
rejoiced
at
her
death
.
Though
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
which
of
them
would
have
caused
most
misery
to
the
other
--
he
to
her
*NL*
or
she
to
him
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
concluded
.
Then
she
began
*NL*
tentatively
questioning
him
about
the
scene
on
the
previous
day
with
*NL*
Luzhin
,
hesitating
and
continually
glancing
at
Dounia
,
obviously
to
*NL*
the
latter
's
annoyance
.
This
incident
more
than
all
the
rest
evidently
*NL*
caused
her
uneasiness
,
even
consternation
.
Razumihin
described
it
in
*NL*
detail
again
,
but
this
time
he
added
his
own
conclusions
:
he
openly
*NL*
blamed
Raskolnikov
for
intentionally
insulting
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
not
*NL*
seeking
to
excuse
him
on
the
score
of
his
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
planned
it
before
his
illness
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
too
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
agreed
with
a
dejected
air
.
*NL*
But
she
was
very
much
surprised
at
hearing
Razumihin
express
himself
*NL*
so
carefully
and
even
with
a
certain
respect
about
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
too
,
was
struck
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
your
opinion
of
Pyotr
Petrovitch
?
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
*NL*
could
not
resist
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
have
no
other
opinion
of
your
daughter
's
future
husband
,
''
*NL*
Razumihin
answered
firmly
and
with
warmth
,
``
and
I
do
n't
say
it
simply
*NL*
from
vulgar
politeness
,
but
because
...
simply
because
Avdotya
Romanovna
*NL*
has
of
her
own
free
will
deigned
to
accept
this
man
.
If
I
spoke
so
*NL*
rudely
of
him
last
night
,
it
was
because
I
was
disgustingly
drunk
and
...
*NL*
mad
besides
;
yes
,
mad
,
crazy
,
I
lost
my
head
completely
...
and
this
*NL*
morning
I
am
ashamed
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
crimsoned
and
ceased
speaking
.
Avdotya
Romanovna
flushed
,
but
did
not
*NL*
break
the
silence
.
She
had
not
uttered
a
word
from
the
moment
they
began
*NL*
to
speak
of
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
her
support
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
obviously
did
not
know
what
*NL*
to
do
.
At
last
,
faltering
and
continually
glancing
at
her
daughter
,
she
*NL*
confessed
that
she
was
exceedingly
worried
by
one
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Dmitri
Prokofitch
,
''
she
began
.
``
I
'll
be
perfectly
open
with
*NL*
Dmitri
Prokofitch
,
Dounia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
mother
,
''
said
Avdotya
Romanovna
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
it
is
,
''
she
began
in
haste
,
as
though
the
permission
to
*NL*
speak
of
her
trouble
lifted
a
weight
off
her
mind
.
``
Very
early
this
*NL*
morning
we
got
a
note
from
Pyotr
Petrovitch
in
reply
to
our
letter
*NL*
announcing
our
arrival
.
He
promised
to
meet
us
at
the
station
,
you
*NL*
know
;
instead
of
that
he
sent
a
servant
to
bring
us
the
address
of
these
*NL*
lodgings
and
to
show
us
the
way
;
and
he
sent
a
message
that
he
would
*NL*
be
here
himself
this
morning
.
But
this
morning
this
note
came
from
him
.
*NL*
You
'd
better
read
it
yourself
;
there
is
one
point
in
it
which
worries
me
*NL*
very
much
...
you
will
soon
see
what
that
is
,
and
...
tell
me
your
candid
*NL*
opinion
,
Dmitri
Prokofitch
!
You
know
Rodya
's
character
better
than
*NL*
anyone
and
no
one
can
advise
us
better
than
you
can
.
Dounia
,
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
,
made
her
decision
at
once
,
but
I
still
do
n't
feel
sure
how
to
act
*NL*
and
I.
.
.
I
've
been
waiting
for
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
opened
the
note
which
was
dated
the
previous
evening
and
read
*NL*
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Madam
,
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
I
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
*NL*
that
owing
to
unforeseen
obstacles
I
was
rendered
unable
to
meet
you
at
*NL*
the
railway
station
;
I
sent
a
very
competent
person
with
the
same
object
*NL*
in
view
.
I
likewise
shall
be
deprived
of
the
honour
of
an
interview
with
*NL*
you
to-morrow
morning
by
business
in
the
Senate
that
does
not
admit
of
*NL*
delay
,
and
also
that
I
may
not
intrude
on
your
family
circle
while
you
*NL*
are
meeting
your
son
,
and
Avdotya
Romanovna
her
brother
.
I
shall
have
*NL*
the
honour
of
visiting
you
and
paying
you
my
respects
at
your
lodgings
*NL*
not
later
than
to-morrow
evening
at
eight
o'clock
precisely
,
and
*NL*
herewith
I
venture
to
present
my
earnest
and
,
I
may
add
,
imperative
*NL*
request
that
Rodion
Romanovitch
may
not
be
present
at
our
interview
--
as
*NL*
he
offered
me
a
gross
and
unprecedented
affront
on
the
occasion
of
my
*NL*
visit
to
him
in
his
illness
yesterday
,
and
,
moreover
,
since
I
desire
*NL*
from
you
personally
an
indispensable
and
circumstantial
explanation
*NL*
upon
a
certain
point
,
in
regard
to
which
I
wish
to
learn
your
own
*NL*
interpretation
.
I
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
,
in
anticipation
,
*NL*
that
if
,
in
spite
of
my
request
,
I
meet
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
I
shall
be
*NL*
compelled
to
withdraw
immediately
and
then
you
have
only
yourself
to
*NL*
blame
.
I
write
on
the
assumption
that
Rodion
Romanovitch
who
appeared
so
*NL*
ill
at
my
visit
,
suddenly
recovered
two
hours
later
and
so
,
being
able
*NL*
to
leave
the
house
,
may
visit
you
also
.
I
was
confirmed
in
that
belief
*NL*
by
the
testimony
of
my
own
eyes
in
the
lodging
of
a
drunken
man
who
*NL*
was
run
over
and
has
since
died
,
to
whose
daughter
,
a
young
woman
of
*NL*
notorious
behaviour
,
he
gave
twenty-five
roubles
on
the
pretext
of
the
*NL*
funeral
,
which
gravely
surprised
me
knowing
what
pains
you
were
at
to
*NL*
raise
that
sum
.
Herewith
expressing
my
special
respect
to
your
estimable
*NL*
daughter
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
I
beg
you
to
accept
the
respectful
homage
*NL*
of
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
humble
servant
,
*NL*

``
P.
LUZHIN

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
now
,
Dmitri
Prokofitch

''
began
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
*NL*
almost
weeping
.
``
How
can
I
ask
Rodya
not
to
come
?
Yesterday
he
insisted
*NL*
so
earnestly
on
our
refusing
Pyotr
Petrovitch
and
now
we
are
ordered
not
*NL*
to
receive
Rodya
!
He
will
come
on
purpose
if
he
knows
,
and
...
what
will
*NL*
happen
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Act
on
Avdotya
Romanovna
's
decision
,
''
Razumihin
answered
calmly
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
!
She
says
...
goodness
knows
what
she
says
,
she
does
n't
*NL*
explain
her
object
!
She
says
that
it
would
be
best
,
at
least
,
not
that
*NL*
it
would
be
best
,
but
that
it
's
absolutely
necessary
that
Rodya
should
*NL*
make
a
point
of
being
here
at
eight
o'clock
and
that
they
must
meet
...
*NL*
I
did
n't
want
even
to
show
him
the
letter
,
but
to
prevent
him
*NL*
from
coming
by
some
stratagem
with
your
help
...
because
he
is
so
*NL*
irritable
...
Besides
I
do
n't
understand
about
that
drunkard
who
died
*NL*
and
that
daughter
,
and
how
he
could
have
given
the
daughter
all
the
*NL*
money
...
which
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
cost
you
such
sacrifice
,
mother
,
''
put
in
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
not
himself
yesterday
,
''
Razumihin
said
thoughtfully
,
``
if
you
*NL*
only
knew
what
he
was
up
to
in
a
restaurant
yesterday
,
though
there
*NL*
was
sense
in
it
too
...
Hm
!
He
did
say
something
,
as
we
were
going
home
*NL*
yesterday
evening
,
about
a
dead
man
and
a
girl
,
but
I
did
n't
understand
*NL*
a
word
...
But
last
night
,
I
myself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
thing
,
mother
,
will
be
for
us
to
go
to
him
ourselves

*NL*
there
I
assure
you
we
shall
see
at
once
what
's
to
be
done
.
Besides
,
*NL*
it
's
getting
late
--
good
heavens
,
it
's
past
ten
,
''
she
cried
looking
at
*NL*
a
splendid
gold
enamelled
watch
which
hung
round
her
neck
on
a
thin
*NL*
Venetian
chain
,
and
looked
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
her
*NL*
dress
.
``
A
present
from
her
_
fiance
_
,
''
thought
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
start
,
Dounia
,
we
must
start
,
''
her
mother
cried
in
a
flutter
.
*NL*
``
He
will
be
thinking
we
are
still
angry
after
yesterday
,
from
our
coming
*NL*
so
late
.
Merciful
heavens
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
said
this
she
was
hurriedly
putting
on
her
hat
and
mantle
;
*NL*
Dounia
,
too
,
put
on
her
things
.
Her
gloves
,
as
Razumihin
noticed
,
were
*NL*
not
merely
shabby
but
had
holes
in
them
,
and
yet
this
evident
poverty
*NL*
gave
the
two
ladies
an
air
of
special
dignity
,
which
is
always
found
in
*NL*
people
who
know
how
to
wear
poor
clothes
.
Razumihin
looked
reverently
*NL*
at
Dounia
and
felt
proud
of
escorting
her
.
``
The
queen
who
mended
her
*NL*
stockings
in
prison
,
''
he
thought
,
``
must
have
looked
then
every
inch
a
*NL*
queen
and
even
more
a
queen
than
at
sumptuous
banquets
and
levees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
exclaimed
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
``
little
did
I
think
that
I
*NL*
should
ever
fear
seeing
my
son
,
my
darling
,
darling
Rodya
!
I
am
afraid

*NL*
Dmitri
Prokofitch

''
she
added
,
glancing
at
him
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid

said
Dounia
,
kissing
her
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
have
faith

him

I
have
n't
slept
all

*NL*
exclaimed
the
poor
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Dounia
,
when
I
dozed
a
little
this
morning
I
dreamed
of

Marfa
Petrovna
...
she
was
all
in
white
...
she
came
up
to
me
,
took
*NL*
my
hand
,
and
shook
her
head
at
me
,
but
so
sternly
as
though
she
were
*NL*
blaming
me
...
Is
that
a
good
omen
?
Oh
,
dear
me
!
You
do
n't
know

Dmitri
*NL*
Prokofitch

that
Marfa
Petrovna
's
dead

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
did

*NL*

She
died
suddenly

and
only

*NL*

Afterwards

put
in
Dounia

He

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

you
do

I
was

me

Dmitri
Prokofitch
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
thinking
about

these
last
few
days

I
look
upon
you
really
as
a
providence
for

and
*NL*
so
I
took
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
all
about
us

I
look
on
you
as
a
*NL*
relation
...
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
for
saying
so
.
Dear
me
,
what
's
the
*NL*
matter
with
your
right
hand
?
Have
you
knocked
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
bruised
it
,
''
muttered
Razumihin
overjoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
speak
too
much
from
the
heart

so
that
Dounia
finds
fault

with

dear
me
,
what
a
cupboard
he
lives
in
!
I
wonder
whether
*NL*
he
is
awake

Does
this
woman

his
landlady
,
consider
it
a
room

Listen

*NL*
you
say
he
does
not
like
to
show
his

perhaps
I

annoy

quite
distracted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

him

much
about
anything

too
much
about

he
does
n't
like
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Dmitri
Prokofitch
,
how
hard
it
is
to
be
a
mother

But
here
are
the

What
an
awful
staircase

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother

you
are
quite
pale

yourself

said
*NL*
Dounia
caressing
her
,
then
with
flashing
eyes
she
added
:
``
He
ought
to
be
*NL*
happy
at
seeing
you

you
are
tormenting
yourself
so

*NL*
``
Wait

I
'll
peep
in

waked
up

*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
slowly
followed
Razumihin
,
who
went
on
before
,
and
when
they
*NL*
reached
the
landlady
's
door
on
the
fourth
storey
,
they
noticed
that
her
*NL*
door
was
a
tiny
crack
open
and
that
two
keen
black
eyes
were
watching
*NL*
them
from
the
darkness
within
.
When
their
eyes
met
,
the
door
was
*NL*
suddenly
shut
with
such
a
slam
that
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
almost
cried
*NL*
out
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
well
,
quite
well
!
''
Zossimov
cried
cheerfully
as
they
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
in
ten
minutes
earlier
and
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
*NL*
as
before
,
on
the
sofa
.
Raskolnikov
was
sitting
in
the
opposite
corner
,
*NL*
fully
dressed
and
carefully
washed
and
combed
,
as
he
had
not
been
for
*NL*
some
time
past
.
The
room
was
immediately
crowded
,
yet
Nastasya
managed
*NL*
to
follow
the
visitors
in
and
stayed
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
really
was
almost
well
,
as
compared
with
his
condition
the
*NL*
day
before
,
but
he
was
still
pale
,
listless
,
and
sombre
.
He
looked
like
*NL*
a
wounded
man
or
one
who
has
undergone
some
terrible
physical
suffering
.
*NL*
His
brows
were
knitted
,
his
lips
compressed
,
his
eyes
feverish
.
He
spoke
*NL*
little
and
reluctantly
,
as
though
performing
a
duty
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
restlessness
in
his
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
wanted
a
sling
on
his
arm
or
a
bandage
on
his
finger
to
complete
*NL*
the
impression
of
a
man
with
a
painful
abscess
or
a
broken
arm
.
The
*NL*
pale
,
sombre
face
lighted
up
for
a
moment
when
his
mother
and
sister
*NL*
entered
,
but
this
only
gave
it
a
look
of
more
intense
suffering
,
in
*NL*
place
of
its
listless
dejection
.
The
light
soon
died
away
,
but
the
look
*NL*
of
suffering
remained
,
and
Zossimov
,
watching
and
studying
his
patient
*NL*
with
all
the
zest
of
a
young
doctor
beginning
to
practise
,
noticed
*NL*
in
him
no
joy
at
the
arrival
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
but
a
sort
of
*NL*
bitter
,
hidden
determination
to
bear
another
hour
or
two
of
inevitable
*NL*
torture
.
He
saw
later
that
almost
every
word
of
the
following
*NL*
conversation
seemed
to
touch
on
some
sore
place
and
irritate
it
.
But
*NL*
at
the
same
time
he
marvelled
at
the
power
of
controlling
himself
*NL*
and
hiding
his
feelings
in
a
patient
who
the
previous
day
had
,
like
a
*NL*
monomaniac
,
fallen
into
a
frenzy
at
the
slightest
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
see
myself
now
that
I
am
almost
well
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
*NL*
giving
his
mother
and
sister
a
kiss
of
welcome
which
made
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
radiant
at
once
.
``
And
I
do
n't
say
this
_
as
I
did
*NL*
yesterday
_
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Razumihin
,
with
a
friendly
pressure
of
*NL*
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
am
quite
surprised
at
him
to-day
,
''
began
Zossimov
,
much
*NL*
delighted
at
the
ladies
'
entrance
,
for
he
had
not
succeeded
in
keeping
*NL*
up
a
conversation
with
his
patient
for
ten
minutes
.
``
In
another
three
or
*NL*
four
days
,
if
he
goes
on
like
this
,
he
will
be
just
as
before
,
that
is
,
*NL*
as
he
was
a
month
ago
,
or
two
...
or
perhaps
even
three
.
This
has
been
*NL*
coming
on
for
a
long
while
...
eh
?
Confess
,
now
,
that
it
has
been
*NL*
perhaps
your
own
fault
?
''
he
added
,
with
a
tentative
smile
,
as
though
*NL*
still
afraid
of
irritating
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
possible
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
,
too
,
''
continued
Zossimov
with
zest
,
``
that
your
complete
*NL*
recovery
depends
solely
on
yourself
.
Now
that
one
can
talk
to
you
,
*NL*
I
should
like
to
impress
upon
you
that
it
is
essential
to
avoid
the
*NL*
elementary
,
so
to
speak
,
fundamental
causes
tending
to
produce
your
*NL*
morbid
condition
:
in
that
case
you
will
be
cured
,
if
not
,
it
will
go
*NL*
from
bad
to
worse
.
These
fundamental
causes
I
do
n't
know
,
but
they
must
*NL*
be
known
to
you
.
You
are
an
intelligent
man
,
and
must
have
observed
*NL*
yourself
,
of
course
.
I
fancy
the
first
stage
of
your
derangement
*NL*
coincides
with
your
leaving
the
university
.
You
must
not
be
left
without
*NL*
occupation
,
and
so
,
work
and
a
definite
aim
set
before
you
might
,
I
*NL*
fancy
,
be
very
beneficial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
you
are
perfectly
right
...
I
will
make
haste
and
return
to
*NL*
the
university
:
and
then
everything
will
go
smoothly
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zossimov
,
who
had
begun
his
sage
advice
partly
to
make
an
effect
before
*NL*
the
ladies
,
was
certainly
somewhat
mystified
,
when
,
glancing
at
his
*NL*
patient
,
he
observed
unmistakable
mockery
on
his
face
.
This
lasted
*NL*
an
instant
,
however
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
began
at
once
thanking
*NL*
Zossimov
,
especially
for
his
visit
to
their
lodging
the
previous
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
he
saw
you
last
night
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
,
as
though
startled
.
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
not
slept
either
after
your
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
Rodya
,
that
was
only
till
two
o'clock
.
Dounia
and
I
never
go
to
*NL*
bed
before
two
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
thank
him
either
,
''
Raskolnikov
went
on
,
*NL*
suddenly
frowning
and
looking
down
.
``
Setting
aside
the
question
of
*NL*
payment
--
forgive
me
for
referring
to
it
-LRB-
he
turned
to
Zossimov
-RRB-
--
I
*NL*
really
do
n't
know
what
I
have
done
to
deserve
such
special
attention
*NL*
from
you
!
I
simply
do
n't
understand
it
...
and
...
and
...
it
weighs
upon
*NL*
me
,
indeed
,
because
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
I
tell
you
so
candidly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
irritated
.
''
Zossimov
forced
himself
to
laugh
.
``
Assume
that
you
*NL*
are
my
first
patient
--
well
--
we
fellows
just
beginning
to
practise
love
*NL*
our
first
patients
as
if
they
were
our
children
,
and
some
almost
fall
in
*NL*
love
with
them
.
And
,
of
course
,
I
am
not
rich
in
patients
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
nothing
about
him
,
''
added
Raskolnikov
,
pointing
to
Razumihin
,
*NL*
``
though
he
has
had
nothing
from
me
either
but
insult
and
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
he
is
talking
!
Why
,
you
are
in
a
sentimental
mood
to-day
,
*NL*
are
you
?
''
shouted
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
had
more
penetration
he
would
have
seen
that
there
was
no
*NL*
trace
of
sentimentality
in
him
,
but
something
indeed
quite
the
opposite
.
*NL*
But
Avdotya
Romanovna
noticed
it
.
She
was
intently
and
uneasily
watching
*NL*
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you
,
mother
,
I
do
n't
dare
to
speak
,
''
he
went
on
,
as
though
*NL*
repeating
a
lesson
learned
by
heart
.
``
It
is
only
to-day
that
I
have
*NL*
been
able
to
realise
a
little
how
distressed
you
must
have
been
here
*NL*
yesterday
,
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
said
this
,
he
suddenly
held
out
his
hand
to
his
sister
,
*NL*
smiling
without
a
word
.
But
in
this
smile
there
was
a
flash
of
real
*NL*
unfeigned
feeling
.
Dounia
caught
it
at
once
,
and
warmly
pressed
his
*NL*
hand
,
overjoyed
and
thankful
.
It
was
the
first
time
he
had
addressed
her
*NL*
since
their
dispute
the
previous
day
.
The
mother
's
face
lighted
up
*NL*
with
ecstatic
happiness
at
the
sight
of
this
conclusive
unspoken
*NL*
reconciliation
.
``
Yes
,
that
is
what
I
love
him
for
,
''
Razumihin
,
*NL*
exaggerating
it
all
,
muttered
to
himself
,
with
a
vigorous
turn
in
his
*NL*
chair
.
``
He
has
these
movements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
well
he
does
it
all
,
''
the
mother
was
thinking
to
herself
.
``
What
*NL*
generous
impulses
he
has
,
and
how
simply
,
how
delicately
he
put
an
end
*NL*
to
all
the
misunderstanding
with
his
sister
--
simply
by
holding
out
his
*NL*
hand
at
the
right
minute
and
looking
at
her
like
that
...
And
what
*NL*
fine
eyes
he
has
,
and
how
fine
his
whole
face
is
!
...
He
is
even
better
*NL*
looking
than
Dounia
...
But
,
good
heavens
,
what
a
suit
--
how
terribly
*NL*
he
's
dressed
!
...
Vasya
,
the
messenger
boy
in
Afanasy
Ivanitch
's
shop
,
is
*NL*
better
dressed
!
I
could
rush
at
him
and
hug
him
...
weep
over
him
--
but
*NL*
I
am
afraid
...
Oh
,
dear
,
he
's
so
strange
!
He
's
talking
kindly
,
but
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
!
Why
,
what
am
I
afraid
of
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Rodya
,
you
would
n't
believe
,
''
she
began
suddenly
,
in
haste
to
*NL*
answer
his
words
to
her
,
``
how
unhappy
Dounia
and
I
were
yesterday
!
Now
*NL*
that
it
's
all
over
and
done
with
and
we
are
quite
happy
again
--
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
.
Fancy
,
we
ran
here
almost
straight
from
the
train
to
embrace
*NL*
you
and
that
woman
--
ah
,
here
she
is
!
Good
morning
,
Nastasya
!
...
She
told
*NL*
us
at
once
that
you
were
lying
in
a
high
fever
and
had
just
run
away
*NL*
from
the
doctor
in
delirium
,
and
they
were
looking
for
you
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
You
ca
n't
imagine
how
we
felt
!
I
could
n't
help
thinking
of
the
*NL*
tragic
end
of
Lieutenant
Potanchikov
,
a
friend
of
your
father
's
--
you
*NL*
ca
n't
remember
him
,
Rodya
--
who
ran
out
in
the
same
way
in
a
high
fever
*NL*
and
fell
into
the
well
in
the
court-yard
and
they
could
n't
pull
him
out
*NL*
till
next
day
.
Of
course
,
we
exaggerated
things
.
We
were
on
the
point
of
*NL*
rushing
to
find
Pyotr
Petrovitch
to
ask
him
to
help
...
Because
we
were
*NL*
alone
,
utterly
alone
,
''
she
said
plaintively
and
stopped
short
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
recollecting
it
was
still
somewhat
dangerous
to
speak
of
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
,
although
``
we
are
quite
happy
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
...
Of
course
it
's
very
annoying
...
''
Raskolnikov
muttered
in
*NL*
reply
,
but
with
such
a
preoccupied
and
inattentive
air
that
Dounia
gazed
*NL*
at
him
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
was
it
I
wanted
to
say
?
''
He
went
on
trying
to
recollect
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
yes
;
mother
,
and
you
too
,
Dounia
,
please
do
n't
think
that
I
did
n't
mean
*NL*
to
come
and
see
you
to-day
and
was
waiting
for
you
to
come
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
,
Rodya
?
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
She
,
too
,
*NL*
was
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
answering
us
as
a
duty
?
''
Dounia
wondered
.
``
Is
he
being
reconciled
*NL*
and
asking
forgiveness
as
though
he
were
performing
a
rite
or
repeating
*NL*
a
lesson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
only
just
waked
up
,
and
wanted
to
go
to
you
,
but
was
delayed
owing
*NL*
to
my
clothes
;
I
forgot
yesterday
to
ask
her
...
Nastasya
...
to
wash
out
*NL*
the
blood
...
I
've
only
just
dressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blood
!
What
blood
?
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
asked
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
--
do
n't
be
uneasy
.
It
was
when
I
was
wandering
about
*NL*
yesterday
,
rather
delirious
,
I
chanced
upon
a
man
who
had
been
run
*NL*
over
...
a
clerk
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delirious
?
But
you
remember
everything
!
''
Razumihin
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
Raskolnikov
answered
with
special
carefulness
.
``
I
*NL*
remember
everything
even
to
the
slightest
detail
,
and
yet
--
why
I
did
*NL*
that
and
went
there
and
said
that
,
I
ca
n't
clearly
explain
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
familiar
phenomenon
,
''
interposed
Zossimov
,
``
actions
are
sometimes
*NL*
performed
in
a
masterly
and
most
cunning
way
,
while
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
actions
is
deranged
and
dependent
on
various
morbid
impressions
--
it
's
*NL*
like
a
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
a
good
thing
really
that
he
should
think
me
almost
a
*NL*
madman
,
''
thought
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
people
in
perfect
health
act
in
the
same
way
too
,
''
observed
*NL*
Dounia
,
looking
uneasily
at
Zossimov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
truth
in
your
observation
,
''
the
latter
replied
.
``
In
that
*NL*
sense
we
are
certainly
all
not
infrequently
like
madmen
,
but
with
the
*NL*
slight
difference
that
the
deranged
are
somewhat
madder
,
for
we
*NL*
must
draw
a
line
.
A
normal
man
,
it
is
true
,
hardly
exists
.
Among
*NL*
dozens
--
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands
--
hardly
one
is
to
be
met
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
word
``
madman
,
''
carelessly
dropped
by
Zossimov
in
his
chatter
on
*NL*
his
favourite
subject
,
everyone
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
sat
seeming
not
to
pay
attention
,
plunged
in
thought
with
a
*NL*
strange
smile
on
his
pale
lips
.
He
was
still
meditating
on
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
about
the
man
who
was
run
over
?
I
interrupted
you
!
''
*NL*
Razumihin
cried
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
Raskolnikov
seemed
to
wake
up
.
``
Oh
...
I
got
spattered
with
*NL*
blood
helping
to
carry
him
to
his
lodging
.
By
the
way
,
mamma
,
I
did
an
*NL*
unpardonable
thing
yesterday
.
I
was
literally
out
of
my
mind
.
I
gave
*NL*
away
all
the
money
you
sent
me
...
to
his
wife
for
the
funeral
.
She
's
*NL*
a
widow
now
,
in
consumption
,
a
poor
creature
...
three
little
children
,
*NL*
starving
...
nothing
in
the
house
...
there
's
a
daughter
,
too
...
perhaps
*NL*
you
'd
have
given
it
yourself
if
you
'd
seen
them
.
But
I
had
no
right
to
*NL*
do
it
I
admit
,
especially
as
I
knew
how
you
needed
the
money
yourself
.
*NL*
To
help
others
one
must
have
the
right
to
do
it
,
or
else

He
laughed
,
``
That
's
right
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
,
Dounia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
,
''
answered
Dounia
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
you
,
too
,
have
ideals
,
''
he
muttered
,
looking
at
her
almost
with
*NL*
hatred
,
and
smiling
sarcastically
.
``
I
ought
to
have
considered
that
...
*NL*
Well
,
that
's
praiseworthy
,
and
it
's
better
for
you
...
and
if
you
reach
a
*NL*
line
you
wo
n't
overstep
,
you
will
be
unhappy
...
and
if
you
overstep
it
,
*NL*
maybe
you
will
be
still
unhappier
...
But
all
that
's
nonsense
,
''
he
added
*NL*
irritably
,
vexed
at
being
carried
away
.
``
I
only
meant
to
say
that
I
beg
*NL*
your
forgiveness
,
mother
,
''
he
concluded
,
shortly
and
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
Rodya
,
I
am
sure
that
everything
you
do
is
very
good
,
''
*NL*
said
his
mother
,
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
too
sure
,
''
he
answered
,
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
followed
.
There
was
a
certain
constraint
in
all
this
*NL*
conversation
,
and
in
the
silence
,
and
in
the
reconciliation
,
and
in
the
*NL*
forgiveness
,
and
all
were
feeling
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
me
,
''
Raskolnikov
was
thinking
*NL*
to
himself
,
looking
askance
at
his
mother
and
sister
.
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
was
indeed
growing
more
timid
the
longer
she
kept
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
in
their
absence
I
seemed
to
love
them
so
much
,
''
flashed
through
*NL*
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Rodya
,
Marfa
Petrovna
is
dead
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
*NL*
suddenly
blurted
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Marfa
Petrovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mercy
on
us

Marfa
Petrovna
Svidrigailov

I
wrote
you
so
much
about
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-a-h
!
Yes
,
I
remember
...
So
she
's
dead
!
Oh
,
really
?

he
roused
*NL*
himself
suddenly
,
as
if
waking
up
.
``
What
did
she
die
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
imagine
,
quite
suddenly
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
answered
*NL*
hurriedly
,
encouraged
by
his
curiosity
.
``
On
the
very
day
I
was
sending
*NL*
you
that
letter
!
Would
you
believe
it
,
that
awful
man
seems
to
have
been
*NL*
the
cause
of
her
death
.
They
say
he
beat
her
dreadfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
were
they
on
such
bad
terms
?

he
asked
,
addressing
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
Quite
the
contrary
indeed

With
her
,
he
was
always
very
*NL*
patient
,
considerate
even
.
In
fact
,
all
those
seven
years
of
their
*NL*
married
life
he
gave
way
to
her
,
too
much
so
indeed
,
in
many
cases
.
All
*NL*
of
a
sudden
he
seems
to
have
lost
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
could
not
have
been
so
awful
if
he
controlled
himself
for
seven
*NL*
years

You
seem
to
be
defending
him

Dounia
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
he
's
an
awful
man

I
can
imagine
nothing
more
awful

Dounia
*NL*
answered
,
almost
with
a
shudder
,
knitting
her
brows
,
and
sinking
into
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
had
happened
in
the
morning
,

Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
went
on
*NL*
hurriedly
.
``
And
directly
afterwards
she
ordered
the
horses
to
be
*NL*
harnessed
to
drive
to
the
town
immediately
after
dinner

She
always
used
*NL*
to
drive
to
the
town
in
such
cases

She
ate
a
very
good
dinner

*NL*
*NL*
``
After

beating

she
went
to
the
bath-house

You
see

she
was
*NL*
undergoing
some
treatment
with
baths

They
have
a
cold
spring
there

and
*NL*
she
used
to
bathe
in
it
regularly
every
day
,

no

got

into
the
water

she
suddenly
had
a
stroke
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should

so

Zossimov

*NL*
``
And
did

beat
her
badly

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

put
in
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

I
do
n't
know
why

gossip

*NL*
said
Raskolnikov
irritably
,
as
it
were
in

himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

my

I
do

from

Alexandrovna

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

he
asked

with
a
constrained
smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

certainly
true

said
Dounia

looking
directly

sternly
at

her

``
Mother

crossing
herself
with
terror

worked

as

in
convulsion

``
Ach

Why
did
you
say
that

Dounia

Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
began
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
--
``
You
see
,
coming
here
,
I
was
dreaming
all
the
way
,
in
the
*NL*
train
,
how
we
should
meet
,
how
we
should
talk
over
everything
*NL*
together
...
And
I
was
so
happy
,
I
did
not
notice
the
journey
!
But
what
*NL*
am
I
saying
?
I
am
happy
now
...
You
should
not
,
Dounia
...
I
am
happy
*NL*
now

simply
in
seeing
you

Rodya
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
mother
,
''
he
muttered
in
confusion
,
not
looking
at
her
,
but
*NL*
pressing
her
hand
.
``
We
shall
have
time
to
speak
freely
of
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
he
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
confusion
and
turned
*NL*
pale
.
Again
that
awful
sensation
he
had
known
of
late
passed
with
deadly
*NL*
chill
over
his
soul
.
Again
it
became
suddenly
plain
and
perceptible
to
*NL*
him
that
he
had
just
told
a
fearful
lie
--
that
he
would
never
now
be
*NL*
able
to
speak
freely
of
everything
--
that
he
would
never
again
be
able
to
*NL*
_
speak
_
of
anything
to
anyone
.
The
anguish
of
this
thought
was
such
that
*NL*
for
a
moment
he
almost
forgot
himself
.
He
got
up
from
his
seat
,
and
not
*NL*
looking
at
anyone
walked
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
about
?
''
cried
Razumihin
,
clutching
him
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
again
,
and
began
looking
about
him
,
in
silence
.
They
were
*NL*
all
looking
at
him
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
all
so
dull
for
?
''
he
shouted
,
suddenly
and
quite
*NL*
unexpectedly
.
``
Do
say
something
!
What
's
the
use
of
sitting

this

*NL*
Come

us
talk

We
meet

Come

anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
;
I
was
afraid
the

yesterday
was
beginning

again

Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
crossing
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

something
;
that
's
all
right
!
...
I
was
beginning
*NL*
to
think
...
''
muttered
Zossimov
,
getting
up
from
the
sofa
.
``
It
is
time
*NL*
for
me
to
be
off
.
I
will
look
in
again
perhaps
...
if
I
can
...
''
He
made
*NL*
his
bows
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
excellent
man
!
''
observed
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
excellent
,
splendid
,
well-educated
,
intelligent
,
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
began
,
suddenly
speaking
with
surprising
rapidity
,
and
a
liveliness
he
*NL*
had
not
shown
till
then
.
``
I
ca
n't
remember
where
I
met
him
before
my
*NL*
illness
...
I
believe
I
have
met
him
somewhere
--
...
And
this
is
a
good
*NL*
man
,
too
,
''
he
nodded
at
Razumihin
.
``
Do
you
like
him
,
Dounia
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
her
;
and
suddenly
,
for
some
unknown
reason
,
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
''
answered
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foo
!
--
what
a
pig
you
are
!
''
Razumihin
protested
,
blushing
in
terrible
*NL*
confusion
,
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
smiled
*NL*
faintly
,
but
Raskolnikov
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
at
all
.
Stay
.
Zossimov
has
gone
,
so
you
must
.
Do
n't
go
.
*NL*
What
's
the
time
?
Is
it
twelve
o'clock
?
What
a
pretty
watch
you
have
got
,
*NL*
Dounia
.
But
why
are
you
all
silent
again
?
I
do
all
the
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
present
from
Marfa
Petrovna
,
''
answered
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
expensive
one
!
''
added
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ah
!
What
a
big
one
!
Hardly
like
a
lady
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
sort
,
''
said
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
not
a
present
from
her
_
fiance
_
,
''
thought
Razumihin
,
and
was
*NL*
unreasonably
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
Luzhin
's
present
,
''
observed
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
has
not
made
Dounia
any
presents
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ah
!
And
do
you
remember
,
mother
,
I
was
in
love
and
wanted
to
get
*NL*
married
?
''
he
said
suddenly
,
looking
at
his
mother
,
who
was
disconcerted
*NL*
by
the
sudden
change
of
subject
and
the
way
he
spoke
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
exchanged
glances
with
Dounia
and
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
,
yes
.
What
shall
I
tell
you
?
I
do
n't
remember
much
indeed
.
She
was
*NL*
such
a
sickly
girl
,
''
he
went
on
,
growing
dreamy
and
looking
down
again
.
*NL*
``
Quite
an
invalid
.
She
was
fond
of
giving
alms
to
the
poor
,
and
was
*NL*
always
dreaming
of
a
nunnery
,
and
once
she
burst
into
tears
when
she
*NL*
began
talking
to
me
about
it
.
Yes
,
yes
,
I
remember
.
I
remember
very
*NL*
well
.
She
was
an
ugly
little
thing
.
I
really
do
n't
know
what
drew
me
*NL*
to
her
then
--
I
think
it
was
because
she
was
always
ill
.
If
she
had
been
*NL*
lame
or
hunchback
,
I
believe
I
should
have
liked
her
better
still
,
''
he
*NL*
smiled
dreamily
.
``
Yes
,
it
was
a
sort
of
spring
delirium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
not
only
spring
delirium
,
''
said
Dounia
,
with
warm
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fixed
a
strained
intent
look
on
his
sister
,
but
did
not
hear
or
did
*NL*
not
understand
her
words
.
Then
,
completely
lost
in
thought
,
he
got
up
,
*NL*
went
up
to
his
mother
,
kissed
her
,
went
back
to
his
place
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
her
even
now
?
''
said
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
?
Now
?
Oh
,
yes
...
You
ask
about
her
?
No
...
that
's
all
now
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
in
another
world
...
and
so
long
ago
.
And
indeed
everything
*NL*
happening
here
seems
somehow
far
away
.
''
He
looked
attentively
at
them
.
*NL*
``
You
,
now
...
I
seem
to
be
looking
at
you
from
a
thousand
miles
away
...
*NL*
but
,
goodness
knows
why
we
are
talking
of
that
!
And
what
's
the
use
of
*NL*
asking
about
it
?
''
he
added
with
annoyance
,
and
biting
his
nails
,
fell
*NL*
into
dreamy
silence
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
wretched
lodging
you
have
,
Rodya
!
It
's
like
a
tomb
,
''
said
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
suddenly
breaking
the
oppressive
silence
.
``
I
*NL*
am
sure
it
's
quite
half
through
your
lodging
you
have
become
so
*NL*
melancholy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lodging
,
''
he
answered
,
listlessly
.
``
Yes
,
the
lodging
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
to
do
with
it
...
I
thought
that
,
too
...
If
only
you
knew
,
though
,
*NL*
what
a
strange
thing
you
said
just
now
,
mother
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
*NL*
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
more
,
and
their
companionship
,
this
mother
and
this
sister
,
*NL*
with
him
after
three
years
'
absence
,
this
intimate
tone
of
conversation
,
*NL*
in
face
of
the
utter
impossibility
of
really
speaking
about
anything
,
*NL*
would
have
been
beyond
his
power
of
endurance
.
But
there
was
one
urgent
*NL*
matter
which
must
be
settled
one
way
or
the
other
that
day
--
so
he
had
*NL*
decided
when
he
woke
.
Now
he
was
glad
to
remember
it
,
as
a
means
of
*NL*
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Dounia
,
''
he
began
,
gravely
and
drily
,
``
of
course
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
for
yesterday
,
but
I
consider
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
again
that
*NL*
I
do
not
withdraw
from
my
chief
point
.
It
is
me
or
Luzhin
.
If
I
am
a
*NL*
scoundrel
,
you
must
not
be
.
One
is
enough
.
If
you
marry
Luzhin
,
I
cease
*NL*
at
once
to
look
on
you
as
a
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodya
,
Rodya
!
It
is
the
same
as
yesterday
again
,
''
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
cried
,
mournfully
.
``
And
why
do
you
call
yourself
a
*NL*
scoundrel
?
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
You
said
the
same
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
Dounia
answered
firmly
and
with
the
same
dryness
.
``
In
all
*NL*
this
there
is
a
mistake
on
your
part
.
I
thought
it
over
at
night
,
*NL*
and
found
out
the
mistake
.
It
is
all
because
you
seem
to
fancy
I
am
*NL*
sacrificing
myself
to
someone
and
for
someone
.
That
is
not
the
case
at
*NL*
all
.
I
am
simply
marrying
for
my
own
sake
,
because
things
are
hard
for
*NL*
me
.
Though
,
of
course
,
I
shall
be
glad
if
I
succeed
in
being
useful
to
*NL*
my
family
.
But
that
is
not
the
chief
motive
for
my
decision
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
lying
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
biting
his
nails
vindictively
.
*NL*
``
Proud
creature
!
She
wo
n't
admit
she
wants
to
do
it
out
of
charity
!
Too
*NL*
haughty
!
Oh
,
base
characters
!
They
even
love
as
though
they
hate
...
Oh
,
*NL*
how
I.
.
.
hate
them
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
''
continued
Dounia
,
``
I
am
marrying
Pyotr
Petrovitch
because
of
*NL*
two
evils
I
choose
the
less
.
I
intend
to
do
honestly
all
he
expects
of
*NL*
me
,
so
I
am
not
deceiving
him
...
Why
did
you
smile
just
now
?
''
She
,
too
,
*NL*
flushed
,
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
anger
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
?
''
he
asked
,
with
a
malignant
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Within
certain
limits
.
Both
the
manner
and
form
of
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
*NL*
courtship
showed
me
at
once
what
he
wanted
.
He
may
,
of
course
,
think
too
*NL*
well
of
himself
,
but
I
hope
he
esteems
me
,
too
...
Why
are
you
laughing
*NL*
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
are
you
blushing
again
?
You
are
lying
,
sister
.
You
are
*NL*
intentionally
lying
,
simply
from
feminine
obstinacy
,
simply
to
hold
your
*NL*
own
against
me
...
You
can
not
respect
Luzhin
.
I
have
seen
him
and
talked
*NL*
with
him
.
So
you
are
selling
yourself
for
money
,
and
so
in
any
case
you
*NL*
are
acting
basely
,
and
I
am
glad
at
least
that
you
can
blush
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
true
.
I
am
not
lying
,
''
cried
Dounia
,
losing
her
composure
.
*NL*
``
I
would
not
marry
him
if
I
were
not
convinced
that
he
esteems
me
*NL*
and
thinks
highly
of
me
.
I
would
not
marry
him
if
I
were
not
firmly
*NL*
convinced
that
I
can
respect
him

Fortunately
,
I
can
have
convincing
*NL*
proof
of
it
this
very
day
...
and
such
a
marriage
is
not
a
vileness
,
as
*NL*
you
say
!
And
even
if
you
were
right
,
if
I
really
had
determined
on
a
*NL*
vile
action
,
is
it
not
merciless
on
your
part
to
speak
to
me
like
that
?
*NL*
Why
do
you
demand
of
me
a
heroism
that
perhaps
you
have
not
either
?
It
*NL*
is
despotism
;
it
is
tyranny
.
If
I
ruin
anyone
,
it
is
only
myself

I
*NL*
am
not
committing
a
murder

Why
do
you
look
at
me

Why
are
you

so
pale

Rodya

darling

's
the
matter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

You
have
made
him
faint

cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

nonsense

It

nothing

A
little
giddiness

not
fainting

fainting
on

H

I
saying

Oh

yes

In

what
way
will
you
get
convincing
proof
to-day
that
you
can
respect
him
,
*NL*
and
that
he

esteems
you

you
said

I

you
said
to-day

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother

show
Rodya

said
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
trembling
hands
,
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
gave
him
the
letter
.
He
*NL*
took
it
with
great
interest
,
but
,
before
opening
it
,
he
suddenly
looked
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
wonder
at
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strange
,

he
said
,
slowly
,
as
though
struck
by
a
new
idea
.
``
What
*NL*
am
I
making
such
a
fuss
for

What
is
it
all
about

Marry
whom
you

*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
as
though
to
himself
,
but
said
it
aloud
,
and
looked
for
*NL*
some
time
at
his
sister
,
as
though
puzzled
.
He
opened
the
letter
at
*NL*
last
,
still
with
the
same
look
of
strange
wonder
on
his
face
.
Then
,
*NL*
slowly
and
attentively
,
he
began
reading
,
and
read
it
through
twice
.
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
showed
marked
anxiety
,
and
all
indeed
expected
*NL*
something
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
surprises
me
,
''
he
began
,
after
a
short
pause
,
handing
the
letter
*NL*
to
his
mother
,
but
not
addressing
anyone
in
particular
,
``
is
that
he
is
a
*NL*
business
man

a
lawyer

his

pretentious
indeed

yet
he
writes
such
an
uneducated
letter

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
started
.
They
had
expected
something
quite
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
all
write

Razumihin
observed
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

read
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Pulcheria

Alexandrovna
began

embarrassed

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

just
the
jargon

Razumihin
put
in

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pyotr

no

of
the
fact

proud
indeed
of
having
made
his
own
way

Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
observed
,
somewhat
offended
by
her

tone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
he
's
proud
of
it
,
he
has
reason

I
do
n't
deny
it

You
seem
to
*NL*
be
offended
,
sister
,
at
my
making
only
such
a
frivolous
criticism
on
the
*NL*
letter
,
and
to
think
that
I
speak
of
such
trifling
matters
on
purpose
to
*NL*
annoy
you
.
It
is
quite
the
contrary
,
an
observation
apropos
of
the
style
*NL*
occurred
to
me
that
is
by
no
means
irrelevant
as
things
stand
.
There
*NL*
is
one
expression
,
`
blame
yourselves
'
put
in
very
significantly
and
*NL*
plainly
,
and
there
is
besides
a
threat
that
he
will
go
away
at
once
if
I
*NL*
am
present
.
That
threat
to
go
away
is
equivalent
to
a
threat
to
abandon
*NL*
you
both
if
you
are
disobedient
,
and
to
abandon
you
now
after
summoning
*NL*
you
to
Petersburg

Well
,
what
do
you
think
?
Can
one
resent
such
an
*NL*
expression
from
Luzhin
,
as
we
should
if
he
-LRB-
he
pointed
to
Razumihin
-RRB-
had
*NL*
written
it
,
or
Zossimov
,
or
one
of
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no

''
answered
Dounia
,
with
more
animation
.
``
I
saw
clearly
that

too
naively
expressed
,
and
that
perhaps
he
simply
has
no
skill
*NL*
in
writing
...
that
is
a
true
criticism
,
brother
.
I
did
not
expect
,
*NL*
indeed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
expressed
in
legal
style
,
and
sounds
coarser
than
perhaps
he
*NL*
intended
.
But
I
must
disillusion
you
a
little
.
There
is
one
expression
*NL*
in
the
letter
,
one
slander
about
me
,
and
rather
a
contemptible
one
.
I
*NL*
gave
the
money
last
night
to
the
widow
,
a
woman
in
consumption
,
crushed
*NL*
with
trouble
,
and
not
`
on
the
pretext
of
the
funeral
,
'
but
simply
to
pay
*NL*
for
the
funeral
,
and
not
to
the
daughter
--
a
young
woman
,
as
he
writes
,
*NL*
of
notorious
behaviour
-LRB-
whom
I
saw
last
night
for
the
first
time
in
my
*NL*
life
-RRB-
--
but
to
the
widow
.
In
all
this
I
see
a
too
hasty
desire
to
slander
*NL*
me
and
to
raise
dissension
between
us
.
It
is
expressed
again
in
legal
*NL*
jargon
,
that
is
to
say
,
with
a
too
obvious
display
of
the
aim
,
and
*NL*
with
a
very
naive
eagerness
.
He
is
a
man
of
intelligence
,
but
to
act
*NL*
sensibly
,
intelligence
is
not
enough
.
It
all
shows
the
man
and
...
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
he
has
a
great
esteem
for
you
.
I
tell
you
this
simply
to
*NL*
warn
you
,
because
I
sincerely
wish
for
your
good
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
did
not
reply
.
Her
resolution
had
been
taken
.
She
was
only
*NL*
awaiting
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
is
your
decision
,
Rodya
?
''
asked
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
who
*NL*
was
more
uneasy
than
ever
at
the
sudden
,
new
businesslike
tone
of
his
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
decision
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
Pyotr
Petrovitch
writes
that
you
are
not

evening

will
go
away

you
come

So
will
you

come

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

he
added
,
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

already

I
fully
agree
with

Pulcheria

*NL*
``
Quite

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
door
was
softly
opened
,
and
a
young
girl
walked
into
*NL*
the
room
,
looking
timidly
about
her
.
Everyone
turned
towards
her
with
*NL*
surprise
and
curiosity
.
At
first
sight
,
Raskolnikov
did
not
recognise
*NL*
her
.
It
was
Sofya
Semyonovna
Marmeladov
.
He
had
seen
her
yesterday
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
but
at
such
a
moment
,
in
such
surroundings
and
in
such
*NL*
a
dress
,
that
his
memory
retained
a
very
different
image
of
her
.
Now
she
*NL*
was
a
modestly
and
poorly-dressed
young
girl
,
very
young
,
indeed
,
*NL*
almost
like
a
child
,
with
a
modest
and
refined
manner
,
with
a
candid
but
*NL*
somewhat
frightened-looking
face
.
She
was
wearing
a
very
plain
indoor
*NL*
dress
,
and
had
on
a
shabby
old-fashioned
hat
,
but
she
still
carried
a
*NL*
parasol
.
Unexpectedly
finding
the
room
full
of
people
,
she
was
not
so
*NL*
much
embarrassed
as
completely
overwhelmed
with
shyness
,
like
a
*NL*
little
child
.
She
was
even
about
to
retreat
.
``
Oh
...
it
's
you
!
''
said
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
extremely
astonished
,
and
he
,
too
,
was
confused
.
He
at
once
*NL*
recollected
that
his
mother
and
sister
knew
through
Luzhin
's
letter
*NL*
of
``
some
young
woman
of
notorious
behaviour
.
''
He
had
only
just
been
*NL*
protesting
against
Luzhin
's
calumny
and
declaring
that
he
had
seen
the
*NL*
girl
last
night
for
the
first
time
,
and
suddenly
she
had
walked
in
.
He
*NL*
remembered
,
too
,
that
he
had
not
protested
against
the
expression
``
of
*NL*
notorious
behaviour
.
''
All
this
passed
vaguely
and
fleetingly
through
*NL*
his
brain
,
but
looking
at
her
more
intently
,
he
saw
that
the
humiliated
*NL*
creature
was
so
humiliated
that
he
felt
suddenly
sorry
for
her
.
When
she
*NL*
made
a
movement
to
retreat
in
terror
,
it
sent
a
pang
to
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
you
,
''
he
said
,
hurriedly
,
with
a
look
that
made
her
*NL*
stop
.
``
Please
sit
down
.
You
come
,
no
doubt
,
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
Allow
me
--
not
there
.
Sit
here
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
Sonia
's
entrance
,
Razumihin
,
who
had
been
sitting
on
one
of
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
three
chairs
,
close
to
the
door
,
got
up
to
allow
her
to
*NL*
enter
.
Raskolnikov
had
at
first
shown
her
the
place
on
the
sofa
where
*NL*
Zossimov
had
been
sitting
,
but
feeling
that
the
sofa
which
served
him
*NL*
as
a
bed
,
was
too
_
familiar
_
a
place
,
he
hurriedly
motioned
her
to
*NL*
Razumihin
's
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sit
here
,
''
he
said
to
Razumihin
,
putting
him
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
sat
down
,
almost
shaking
with
terror
,
and
looked
timidly
at
the
*NL*
two
ladies
.
It
was
evidently
almost
inconceivable
to
herself
that
she
*NL*
could
sit
down
beside
them
.
At
the
thought
of
it
,
she
was
so
frightened
*NL*
that
she
hurriedly
got
up
again
,
and
in
utter
confusion
addressed
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
I.
.
.
have
come
for
one
minute
.
Forgive
me
for
disturbing
you
,
''
she
*NL*
began
falteringly
.
``
I
come
from
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
she
had
no
one
to
*NL*
send
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
told
me
to
beg
you
...
to
be
at
the
service
...
in
*NL*
the
morning
...
at
Mitrofanievsky
...
and
then
...
to
us
...
to
her
...
*NL*
to
do
her
the
honour
...
she
told
me
to
beg
you
...
''
Sonia
stammered
and
*NL*
ceased
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
,
certainly
,
most
certainly
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
He
,
*NL*
too
,
stood
up
,
and
he
,
too
,
faltered
and
could
not
finish
his
sentence
.
*NL*
``
Please
sit
down
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
.
``
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
You
are
*NL*
perhaps
in
a
hurry
,
but
please
,
be
so
kind
,
spare
me
two
minutes
,
''
and
*NL*
he
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
sat
down
again
,
and
again
timidly
she
took
a
hurried
,
frightened
*NL*
look
at
the
two
ladies
,
and
dropped
her
eyes
.
Raskolnikov
's
pale
face
*NL*
flushed
,
a
shudder
passed
over
him
,
his
eyes
glowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
firmly
and
insistently
,
``
this
is
Sofya
Semyonovna
*NL*
Marmeladov
,
the
daughter
of
that
unfortunate
Mr.
Marmeladov
,
who
was
run
*NL*
over
yesterday
before
my
eyes
,
and
of
whom
I
was
just
telling
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
glanced
at
Sonia
,
and
slightly
screwed
up
*NL*
her
eyes
.
In
spite
of
her
embarrassment
before
Rodya
's
urgent
and
*NL*
challenging
look
,
she
could
not
deny
herself
that
satisfaction
.
Dounia
*NL*
gazed
gravely
and
intently
into
the
poor
girl
's
face
,
and
scrutinised
*NL*
her
with
perplexity
.
Sonia
,
hearing
herself
introduced
,
tried
to
raise
*NL*
her
eyes
again
,
but
was
more
embarrassed
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
ask
you
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
hastily
,
``
how
things
were
*NL*
arranged
yesterday
.
You
were
not
worried
by
the
police
,
for
instance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
was
all
right
...
it
was
too
evident
,
the
cause
of
death
...
*NL*
they
did
not
worry
us
...
only
the
lodgers
are
angry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
body
's
remaining
so
long
.
You
see
it
is
hot
now
.
So
that
,
*NL*
to-day
,
they
will
carry
it
to
the
cemetery
,
into
the
chapel
,
until
*NL*
to-morrow
.
At
first
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
unwilling
,
but
now
she
sees
*NL*
herself
that
it
's
necessary
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
begs
you
to
do
us
the
honour
to
be
in
the
church
to-morrow
for
the
*NL*
service

then
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
lunch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
giving
a
funeral
lunch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
just
a
little
...
She
told
me
to
thank
you
very
much
for
helping
*NL*
us
yesterday
.
But
for
you
,
we
should
have
had
nothing
for
the
funeral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
her
lips
and
chin
began
trembling
,
but
,
with
an
effort
,
she
*NL*
controlled
herself
,
looking
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
conversation
,
Raskolnikov
watched
her
carefully
.
She
had
a
*NL*
thin
,
very
thin
,
pale
little
face
,
rather
irregular
and
angular
,
with
a
*NL*
sharp
little
nose
and
chin
.
She
could
not
have
been
called
pretty
,
but
*NL*
her
blue
eyes
were
so
clear
,
and
when
they
lighted
up
,
there
was
such
*NL*
a
kindliness
and
simplicity
in
her
expression
that
one
could
not
help
*NL*
being
attracted
.
Her
face
,
and
her
whole
figure
indeed
,
had
another
*NL*
peculiar
characteristic
.
In
spite
of
her
eighteen
years
,
she
looked
*NL*
almost
a
little
girl
--
almost
a
child
.
And
in
some
of
her
gestures
,
this
*NL*
childishness
seemed
almost
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
has
Katerina
Ivanovna
been
able
to
manage
with
such
small
means
?
*NL*
Does
she
even
mean
to
have
a
funeral
lunch
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
,
*NL*
persistently
keeping
up
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coffin
will
be
plain
,
of
course

and
everything
will
be
plain

so
*NL*
it
wo
n't
cost
much

Katerina
Ivanovna
and
I
have
reckoned
it
all
out
,
so
*NL*
that
there
will
be
enough
left
...
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
very
anxious
*NL*
it
should
be
so
.
You
know
one
ca
n't

it
's
a
comfort
to
her

she
is

like
that

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

I
understand

of

why
do
you
look
at

*NL*

My

has
just
said
it
is
like
a
tomb

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gave
us
everything
yesterday
,
''
Sonia
said
suddenly
,
in
reply
,
in
a
*NL*
loud
rapid
whisper
;
and
again
she
looked
down
in
confusion
.
Her
lips
*NL*
and
chin
were
trembling
once
more
.
She
had
been
struck
at
once
*NL*
by
Raskolnikov
's
poor
surroundings
,
and
now
these
words
broke
out
*NL*
spontaneously
.
A
silence
followed
.
There
was
a
light
in
Dounia
's
eyes
,
*NL*
and
even
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
looked
kindly
at
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodya
,
''
she
said
,
getting
up
,
``
we
shall
have
dinner
together
,
of
*NL*
course

Come

Dounia
...
And
you
,
Rodya
,
had
better
go
for
a
little
*NL*
walk
,
and
then
rest
and
lie
down
before
you
come
to
see
us

I
am
*NL*
afraid
we
have
exhausted
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
'll
come
,
''
he
answered
,
getting
up
fussily
.
``
But
I
have
*NL*
something
to
see
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
you
will
have
dinner
together
?
''
cried
Razumihin
,
looking
in
*NL*
surprise
at
Raskolnikov
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes

I
am
coming

you
stay
a
minute

You
do
not
want
him
just
now

do
you

Or
perhaps
I
am
taking
him
*NL*
from
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

no

And
will
you

Dmitri
Prokofitch

do
us
the
favour

with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do

added
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
bowed
,
positively
radiant
.
For
one
moment
,
they
were
all
*NL*
strangely
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Rodya
,

is

I
do
not
like

good-bye

*NL*
Good-bye

Nastasya

Ah

I
have
said
good-bye
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
meant
to
greet
Sonia
,
too
;
but
it
somehow
failed
*NL*
to
come
off
,
and
she
went
in
a
flutter
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Avdotya
Romanovna
seemed
to
await
her
turn
,
and
following
her
mother
*NL*
out
,
gave
Sonia
an
attentive
,
courteous
bow
.
Sonia
,
in
confusion
,
gave
*NL*
a
hurried
,
frightened
curtsy
.
There
was
a
look
of
poignant
discomfort
*NL*
in
her
face
,
as
though
Avdotya
Romanovna
's
courtesy
and
attention
were
*NL*
oppressive
and
painful
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

in
the
passage

``
Give
me
your
*NL*
hand

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
did
give
it
to
you

Have
you
forgotten

''
said
Dounia
,
turning
*NL*
warmly
and
awkwardly
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
give
it
to
me
again
.
''
And
he
squeezed
her
fingers
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
smiled
,
flushed
,
pulled
her
hand
away
,
and
went
off
quite
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
's
capital
,
''
he
said
to
Sonia
,
going
back
and
looking
*NL*
brightly
at
her
.
``
God
give
peace
to
the
dead
,
the
living
have
still
to
*NL*
live
.
That
is
right
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
surprised
at
the
sudden
brightness
of
his
face
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
her
for
some
moments
in
silence
.
The
whole
history
of
the
dead
father
*NL*
floated
before
his
memory
in
those
moments
...

*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
,
Dounia

''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
began
,
as
soon
as
they
were
in
*NL*
the
street
,
``
I
really
feel
relieved
myself
at
coming
away
--
more
at
ease
.
*NL*
How
little
did
I
think
yesterday
in
the
train
that
I
could
ever
be
glad
*NL*
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
again
,
mother
,
he
is
still
very
ill
.
Do
n't
you
see
it
?
*NL*
Perhaps
worrying
about
us
upset
him
.
We
must
be
patient
,
and
much
,
much
*NL*
can
be
forgiven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
were
not
very
patient
!
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
caught
her
up
,
*NL*
hotly
and
jealously
.
``
Do
you
know
,
Dounia
,
I
was
looking
at
you
two
.
You
*NL*
are
the
very
portrait
of
him
,
and
not
so
much
in
face
as
in
soul
.
You
*NL*
are
both
melancholy
,
both
morose
and
hot-tempered
,
both
haughty
and
both
*NL*
generous

Surely
he
ca
n't
be
an
egoist

Dounia

Eh

When
I
think
of

what
is

this

my

sinks

poor
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
blurted
out

incautiously

*NL*
``
He
wo
n't

sharply

contemptuously

*NL*
*NL*
``

Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
hurriedly
broke
in

*NL*

He

it

fearfully
close

where
is

one
to
get
a
breath

Nothing

cried
Dounia
,
in
vexation

``
What
nonsense

with

your
presentiments

He
only
made
her

was
so
frightened

She
was
gazing
at

with
those
eyes

I
could
*NL*
scarcely
sit
still
in
my
chair
when
he
began
introducing
her

do
you

remember
?
It
seems
so
strange
,
but
Pyotr
Petrovitch
writes
like
that
*NL*
about
her
,
and
he
introduces
her
to
us

to
you
!
So
he
must
think
a
great

deal
of
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
People
will
write
anything

were
talked

am
sure
that
she
is
a
good

all
nonsense

Dounia
snapped
out
,
*NL*
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
crushed

the

``

he
turned

suddenly
to
Razumihin
again

You

Porfiry
Petrovitch

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so

added
the

with

interest

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
he
managing

yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

well

Razumihin
's
eyes
opened
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
inquiring
for
people
who
had
pawned
things

and
I
have
some
*NL*
pledges
there
,
too
--
trifles
--
a
ring
my
sister
gave
me
as
a
keepsake
when
*NL*
I
left
home
,
and
my
father
's
silver
watch
--
they
are
only
worth
five
or
*NL*
six
roubles
altogether
...
but
I
value
them
.
So
what
am
I
to
do
now
?
I
*NL*
do
not
want
to
lose
the
things
,
especially
the
watch
.
I
was
quaking
just
*NL*
now
,
for
fear
mother
would
ask
to
look
at
it
,
when
we
spoke
of
Dounia
's
*NL*
watch

It
is
the
only
thing
of
father

left
us

She
would
be
ill

it
were
lost

You
know

women
are

So
tell
me
what
to
do

I
know
I
*NL*
ought
to
have
given
notice
at
the
police
station

but
would
it
not
be
*NL*
better
to
go
straight
to
Porfiry
?
Eh
?
What
do
you
think
?
The
matter
*NL*
might
be
settled
more
quickly
.
You
see

mother
may
ask
for
it
before
*NL*
dinner

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

Certainly
to

Razumihin

shouted
in
extraordinary
excitement

``
Well

glad
I

Let

yesterday

So

So

out
splendidly

Oh

yes

Sofya
Ivanovna

*NL*
*NL*
``

Raskolnikov

to
go
now

Sonia
was
beginning
,
not
looking
at
Razumihin
*NL*
at
all
,
and
still
more
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go

decided
Raskolnikov

``
I
will
come
to
you
to-day

Semyonovna

Only
tell
me
where
you

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
exactly
ill
at
ease
,
but
seemed
hurried
,
and
avoided
her
*NL*
eyes
.
Sonia
gave
her
address
,
and
flushed
as
she
did
so
.
They
all
went
*NL*
out
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
lock
up
?
''
asked
Razumihin
,
following
him
on
to
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
``
I
have
been
meaning
to
buy
a
lock
for
*NL*
these
two
years
.
People
are
happy
who
have
no
need
of
locks
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
laughing
,
to
Sonia
.
They
stood
still
in
the
gateway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
go
to
the
right

Sofya
Semyonovna

How
did
you
find
me
,
by
the
*NL*
way
?
''
he
added
,
as
though
he
wanted
to
say
something
quite
different
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
look
at
her
soft
clear
eyes
,
but
this
was
not
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
gave
your
address
to
Polenka
yesterday

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Polenka

Oh

yes

Polenka

the
little
girl

Did
I
give
her
the
address

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

had
you
forgotten

*NL*
``
No

not
know
it

And
now
I
came

and
as
I
had
learnt
your

*NL*
I
asked
to-day
,

Where
does
Mr.

live

I
did
not
know

*NL*
had
only
a
room
too
...
Good-bye
,
I
will
tell
Katerina
Ivanovna

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
extremely
glad
to
escape
at
last
;
she
went
away
looking
down
,
*NL*
hurrying
to
get
out
of
sight
as
soon
as
possible
,
to
walk
the
twenty
*NL*
steps
to
the
turning
on
the
right
and
to
be
at
last
alone
,
and
then
*NL*
moving
rapidly
along
,
looking
at
no
one
,
noticing
nothing
,
to
think
,
to
*NL*
remember
,
to
meditate
on
every
word
,
every
detail
.
Never
,
never
had
she
*NL*
felt
anything
like
this
.
Dimly
and
unconsciously
a
whole
new
world
was
*NL*
opening
before
her
.
She
remembered
suddenly
that
Raskolnikov
meant
to
*NL*
come
to
her
that
day
,
perhaps
at
once
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
not
to-day
,
please
,
not
to-day
!
''
she
kept
muttering
with
a
sinking
*NL*
heart
,
as
though
entreating
someone
,
like
a
frightened
child
.
``
Mercy
!
to
*NL*
me
...
to
that
room
...
he
will
see
...
oh
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
capable
at
that
instant
of
noticing
an
unknown
gentleman
who
*NL*
was
watching
her
and
following
at
her
heels
.
He
had
accompanied
her
from
*NL*
the
gateway
.
At
the
moment
when
Razumihin
,
Raskolnikov
,
and
she
stood
*NL*
still
at
parting
on
the
pavement
,
this
gentleman
,
who
was
just
passing
,
*NL*
started
on
hearing
Sonia
's
words
:
``
and
I
asked
where
Mr.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
lived
?
''
He
turned
a
rapid
but
attentive
look
upon
all
three
,
especially
*NL*
upon
Raskolnikov
,
to
whom
Sonia
was
speaking
;
then
looked
back
and
noted
*NL*
the
house
.
All
this
was
done
in
an
instant
as
he
passed
,
and
trying
not
*NL*
to
betray
his
interest
,
he
walked
on
more
slowly
as
though
waiting
for
*NL*
something
.
He
was
waiting
for
Sonia
;
he
saw
that
they
were
parting
,
and
*NL*
that
Sonia
was
going
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
?
Where
?
I
've
seen
that
face
somewhere
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
must
find
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
turning
he
crossed
over
,
looked
round
,
and
saw
Sonia
coming
the
*NL*
same
way
,
noticing
nothing
.
She
turned
the
corner
.
He
followed
her
on
*NL*
the
other
side
.
After
about
fifty
paces
he
crossed
over
again
,
overtook
*NL*
her
and
kept
two
or
three
yards
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
man
about
fifty
,
rather
tall
and
thickly
set
,
with
broad
high
*NL*
shoulders
which
made
him
look
as
though
he
stooped
a
little
.
He
wore
*NL*
good
and
fashionable
clothes
,
and
looked
like
a
gentleman
of
position
.
*NL*
He
carried
a
handsome
cane
,
which
he
tapped
on
the
pavement
at
each
*NL*
step
;
his
gloves
were
spotless
.
He
had
a
broad
,
rather
pleasant
face
*NL*
with
high
cheek-bones
and
a
fresh
colour
,
not
often
seen
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
His
flaxen
hair
was
still
abundant
,
and
only
touched
here
and
there
with
*NL*
grey
,
and
his
thick
square
beard
was
even
lighter
than
his
hair
.
*NL*
His
eyes
were
blue
and
had
a
cold
and
thoughtful
look
;
his
lips
were
*NL*
crimson
.
He
was
a
remarkedly
well-preserved
man
and
looked
much
younger
*NL*
than
his
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sonia
came
out
on
the
canal
bank
,
they
were
the
only
two
persons
on
*NL*
the
pavement
.
He
observed
her
dreaminess
and
preoccupation
.
On
reaching
*NL*
the
house
where
she
lodged
,
Sonia
turned
in
at
the
gate
;
he
followed
*NL*
her
,
seeming
rather
surprised
.
In
the
courtyard
she
turned
to
the
right
*NL*
corner
.
``
Bah
!
''
muttered
the
unknown
gentleman
,
and
mounted
the
stairs
*NL*
behind
her
.
Only
then
Sonia
noticed
him
.
She
reached
the
third
storey
,
*NL*
turned
down
the
passage
,
and
rang
at
No.
9
.
On
the
door
was
inscribed
*NL*
in
chalk
,
``
Kapernaumov
,
Tailor
.
''
``
Bah
!
''
the
stranger
repeated
again
,
*NL*
wondering
at
the
strange
coincidence
,
and
he
rang
next
door
,
at
No.
8
.
*NL*
The
doors
were
two
or
three
yards
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
lodge
at
Kapernaumov
's
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
Sonia
and
laughing
.
*NL*
``
He
altered
a
waistcoat
for
me
yesterday
.
I
am
staying
close
here
at
*NL*
Madame
Resslich
's
.
How
odd
!
''
Sonia
looked
at
him
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
neighbours
,
''
he
went
on
gaily
.
``
I
only
came
to
town
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
.
Good-bye
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
made
no
reply
;
the
door
opened
and
she
slipped
in
.
She
felt
for
*NL*
some
reason
ashamed
and
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
to
Porfiry
's
,
Razumihin
was
obviously
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
capital
,
brother
,
''
he
repeated
several
times
,
``
and
I
am
glad
!
I
*NL*
am
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
glad
about
?
''
Raskolnikov
thought
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
you
pledged
things
at
the
old
woman
's
,
too
.
And
...
*NL*
was
it
long
ago
?
I
mean
,
was
it
long
since
you
were
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
simple-hearted
fool
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
was
it
?
''
Raskolnikov
stopped
still
to
recollect
.
``
Two
or
three
*NL*
days
before
her
death
it
must
have
been
.
But
I
am
not
going
to
redeem
*NL*
the
things
now
,
''
he
put
in
with
a
sort
of
hurried
and
conspicuous
*NL*
solicitude
about
the
things
.
``
I
've
not
more
than
a
silver
rouble
*NL*
left
...
after
last
night
's
accursed
delirium
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
special
emphasis
on
the
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
Razumihin
hastened
to
agree
--
with
what
was
not
clear
.
``
Then
*NL*
that
's
why
you
...
were
stuck
...
partly
...
you
know
in
your
delirium
you
*NL*
were
continually
mentioning
some
rings
or
chains
!
Yes
,
yes
...
that
's
*NL*
clear
,
it
's
all
clear
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
How
that
idea
must
have
got
about
among
them
.
Here
this
man
will
*NL*
go
to
the
stake
for
me
,
and
I
find
him
delighted
at
having
it
_
cleared
*NL*
up
_
why
I
spoke
of
rings
in
my
delirium
!
What
a
hold
the
idea
must
have
*NL*
on
all
of
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
find
him
?
''
he
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
Razumihin
answered
quickly
.
``
He
is
a
nice
fellow
,
you
will
*NL*
see
,
brother
.
Rather
clumsy
,
that
is
to
say
,
he
is
a
man
of
polished
*NL*
manners
,
but
I
mean
clumsy
in
a
different
sense
.
He
is
an
intelligent
*NL*
fellow
,
very
much
so
indeed
,
but
he
has
his
own
range
of
ideas
...
He
*NL*
is
incredulous
,
sceptical
,
cynical
...
he
likes
to
impose
on
people
,
or
*NL*
rather
to
make
fun
of
them
.
His
is
the
old
,
circumstantial
method
...
*NL*
But
he
understands
his
work
...
thoroughly
...
Last
year
he
cleared
up
a
*NL*
case
of
murder
in
which
the
police
had
hardly
a
clue
.
He
is
very
,
very
*NL*
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
grounds
is
he
so
anxious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
exactly
...
you
see
,
since
you
've
been
ill
I
happen
to
have
*NL*
mentioned
you
several
times
...
So
,
when
he
heard
about
you
...
about
*NL*
your
being
a
law
student
and
not
able
to
finish
your
studies
,
he
said
,
*NL*
`
What
a
pity
!
'
And
so
I
concluded
...
from
everything
together
,
not
only
*NL*
that
;
yesterday
Zametov
...
you
know
,
Rodya
,
I
talked
some
nonsense
on
*NL*
the
way
home
to
you
yesterday
,
when
I
was
drunk
...
I
am
afraid
,
brother
,
*NL*
of
your
exaggerating
it
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
That
they
think
I
am
a
madman
?
Maybe
they
are
right
,
''
he
said
*NL*
with
a
constrained
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
...
That
is
,
pooh
,
no
!
...
But
all
that
I
said
-LRB-
and
there
was
*NL*
something
else
too
-RRB-
it
was
all
nonsense
,
drunken
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
apologising
?
I
am
so
sick
of
it
all
!
''
Raskolnikov
cried
*NL*
with
exaggerated
irritability
.
It
was
partly
assumed
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
I
understand
.
Believe
me
,
I
understand
.
One
's
ashamed
*NL*
to
speak
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
ashamed
,
then
do
n't
speak
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
silent
.
Razumihin
was
more
than
ecstatic
and
Raskolnikov
*NL*
perceived
it
with
repulsion
.
He
was
alarmed
,
too
,
by
what
Razumihin
had
*NL*
just
said
about
Porfiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
pull
a
long
face
with
him
too
,
''
he
thought
,
with
a
*NL*
beating
heart
,
and
he
turned
white
,
``
and
do
it
naturally
,
too
.
But
the
*NL*
most
natural
thing
would
be
to
do
nothing
at
all
.
Carefully
do
nothing
*NL*
at
all
!
No
,
_
carefully
_
would
not
be
natural
again
...
Oh
,
well
,
we
*NL*
shall
see
how
it
turns
out
...
We
shall
see
...
directly
.
Is
it
a
good
*NL*
thing
to
go
or
not
?
The
butterfly
flies
to
the
light
.
My
heart
is
*NL*
beating
,
that
's
what
's
bad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
grey
house
,
''
said
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
important
thing
,
does
Porfiry
know
that
I
was
at
the
old
*NL*
hag
's
flat
yesterday
...
and
asked
about
the
blood
?
I
must
find
that
out
*NL*
instantly
,
as
soon
as
I
go
in
,
find
out
from
his
face
;
otherwise
...
I
'll
*NL*
find
out
,
if
it
's
my
ruin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
brother
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
addressing
Razumihin
,
with
a
sly
*NL*
smile
,
``
I
have
been
noticing
all
day
that
you
seem
to
be
curiously
*NL*
excited

Is
n't
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excited
?
Not
a
bit
of
it

''
said
Razumihin
,
stung
to
the
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
brother
,
I
assure
you
it
's
noticeable

Why
,
you
sat
on
your
chair
*NL*
in
a
way
you
never
do
sit
,
on
the
edge
somehow
,
and
you
seemed
to
be
*NL*
writhing
all
the
time
.
You
kept
jumping
up
for
nothing
.
One
moment
you
*NL*
were
angry
,
and
the
next
your
face
looked
like
a
sweetmeat
.
You
even
*NL*
blushed
;
especially
when
you
were
invited
to
dinner
,
you
blushed
*NL*
awfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
sort

nonsense

What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
wriggling
out
of
it
,
like
a
schoolboy
?
By
Jove
,
there
*NL*
he
's
blushing
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pig
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
so
shamefaced
about
it
?
Romeo
!
Stay
,
I
'll
tell
of
you
*NL*
to-day
.
Ha-ha-ha
!
I
'll
make
mother
laugh
,
and
someone
else
,
too

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
listen
,
listen

this
is
serious

What
next
,
you
fiend
!
''
*NL*
Razumihin
was
utterly
overwhelmed
,
turning
cold
with
horror
.
``
What
will
*NL*
you
tell
them
?
Come
,
brother

foo
!
what
a
pig
you
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
like
a
summer
rose

And
if

you
knew
how
it
suits
you

a

over
six
foot
high
!
And
how
you
've
washed
to-day
--
you
cleaned
your
*NL*
nails

I
declare
.
Eh

That
's
something
unheard
of

Why

I
do
believe

you

got
pomatum
on
your
hair

Bend
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pig
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
laughed
as
though
he
could
not
restrain
himself
.
So
*NL*
laughing
,
they
entered
Porfiry
Petrovitch
's
flat
.
This
is
what
*NL*
Raskolnikov
wanted
:
from
within
they
could
be
heard
laughing
as
they
*NL*
came
in
,
still
guffawing
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
here
or
I
'll
...
brain
you
!
''
Razumihin
whispered
furiously
,
*NL*
seizing
Raskolnikov
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
already
entering
the
room
.
He
came
in
looking
as
though
*NL*
he
had
the
utmost
difficulty
not
to
burst
out
laughing
again
.
Behind
him
*NL*
Razumihin
strode
in
gawky
and
awkward
,
shamefaced
and
red
as
a
peony
,
*NL*
with
an
utterly
crestfallen
and
ferocious
expression
.
His
face
and
*NL*
whole
figure
really
were
ridiculous
at
that
moment
and
amply
justified
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
laughter
.
Raskolnikov
,
not
waiting
for
an
introduction
,
*NL*
bowed
to
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*NL*
looking
inquiringly
at
them
.
He
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
hands
,
still
*NL*
apparently
making
desperate
efforts
to
subdue
his
mirth
and
utter
a
few
*NL*
words
to
introduce
himself
.
But
he
had
no
sooner
succeeded
in
assuming
*NL*
a
serious
air
and
muttering
something
when
he
suddenly
glanced
again
as
*NL*
though
accidentally
at
Razumihin
,
and
could
no
longer
control
himself
:
*NL*
his
stifled
laughter
broke
out
the
more
irresistibly
the
more
he
tried
*NL*
to
restrain
it
.
The
extraordinary
ferocity
with
which
Razumihin
received
*NL*
this
``
spontaneous
''
mirth
gave
the
whole
scene
the
appearance
of
most
*NL*
genuine
fun
and
naturalness
.
Razumihin
strengthened
this
impression
as
*NL*
though
on
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
!
You
fiend
,
''
he
roared
,
waving
his
arm
which
at
once
struck
a
*NL*
little
round
table
with
an
empty
tea-glass
on
it
.
Everything
was
sent
*NL*
flying
and
crashing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
break
chairs
,
gentlemen
?
You
know
it
's
a
loss
to
the
Crown
,
''
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
quoted
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
still
laughing
,
with
his
hand
in
Porfiry
Petrovitch
's
,
*NL*
but
anxious
not
to
overdo
it
,
awaited
the
right
moment
to
put
a
natural
*NL*
end
to
it
.
Razumihin
,
completely
put
to
confusion
by
upsetting
the
table
*NL*
and
smashing
the
glass
,
gazed
gloomily
at
the
fragments
,
cursed
and
*NL*
turned
sharply
to
the
window
where
he
stood
looking
out
with
his
back
*NL*
to
the
company
with
a
fiercely
scowling
countenance
,
seeing
nothing
.
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
laughed
and
was
ready
to
go
on
laughing
,
but
*NL*
obviously
looked
for
explanations
.
Zametov
had
been
sitting
in
the
*NL*
corner
,
but
he
rose
at
the
visitors
'
entrance
and
was
standing
in
*NL*
expectation
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
,
though
he
looked
with
surprise
and
*NL*
even
it
seemed
incredulity
at
the
whole
scene
and
at
Raskolnikov
with
a
*NL*
certain
embarrassment
.
Zametov
's
unexpected
presence
struck
Raskolnikov
*NL*
unpleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
think
of
that
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Excuse
me
,
please
,
''
he
began
,
*NL*
affecting
extreme
embarrassment
.
``
Raskolnikov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
very
pleasant
to
see
you
...
and
how
pleasantly
you
've
come
*NL*
in
...
Why
,
wo
n't
he
even
say
good-morning
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
nodded
*NL*
at
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honour
I
do
n't
know
why
he
is
in
such
a
rage
with
me
.
I
only
*NL*
told
him
as
we
came
along
that
he
was
like
Romeo
...
and
proved
it
.
And
*NL*
that
was
all
,
I
think
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pig
!
''
ejaculated
Razumihin
,
without
turning
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
have
been
very
grave
grounds
for
it
,
if
he
is
so
furious
at
*NL*
the
word
,
''
Porfiry
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
sharp
lawyer
!
...
Damn
you
all
!
''
snapped
Razumihin
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
bursting
out
laughing
himself
,
he
went
up
to
Porfiry
with
a
more
*NL*
cheerful
face
as
though
nothing
had
happened
.
``
That
'll
do
!
We
are
*NL*
all
fools
.
To
come
to
business
.
This
is
my
friend
Rodion
Romanovitch
*NL*
Raskolnikov
;
in
the
first
place
he
has
heard
of
you
and
wants
to
make
*NL*
your
acquaintance
,
and
secondly
,
he
has
a
little
matter
of
business
with
*NL*
you
.
Bah
!
Zametov
,
what
brought
you
here
?
Have
you
met
before
?
Have
you
*NL*
known
each
other
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
?
''
thought
Raskolnikov
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zametov
seemed
taken
aback
,
but
not
very
much
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
was
at
your
rooms
we
met
yesterday
,
''
he
said
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
have
been
spared
the
trouble
.
All
last
week
he
was
begging
me
*NL*
to
introduce
him
to
you
.
Porfiry
and
you
have
sniffed
each
other
out
*NL*
without
me
.
Where
is
your
tobacco
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
was
wearing
a
dressing-gown
,
very
clean
linen
,
and
*NL*
trodden-down
slippers
.
He
was
a
man
of
about
five
and
thirty
,
short
,
*NL*
stout
even
to
corpulence
,
and
clean
shaven
.
He
wore
his
hair
cut
short
*NL*
and
had
a
large
round
head
,
particularly
prominent
at
the
back
.
His
*NL*
soft
,
round
,
rather
snub-nosed
face
was
of
a
sickly
yellowish
colour
,
*NL*
but
had
a
vigorous
and
rather
ironical
expression
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
good-natured
except
for
a
look
in
the
eyes
,
which
shone
with
a
watery
,
*NL*
mawkish
light
under
almost
white
,
blinking
eyelashes
.
The
expression
*NL*
of
those
eyes
was
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
his
somewhat
womanish
*NL*
figure
,
and
gave
it
something
far
more
serious
than
could
be
guessed
at
*NL*
first
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Porfiry
Petrovitch
heard
that
his
visitor
had
a
little
matter
*NL*
of
business
with
him
,
he
begged
him
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
and
sat
down
*NL*
himself
on
the
other
end
,
waiting
for
him
to
explain
his
business
,
with
*NL*
that
careful
and
over-serious
attention
which
is
at
once
oppressive
and
*NL*
embarrassing
,
especially
to
a
stranger
,
and
especially
if
what
you
are
*NL*
discussing
is
in
your
opinion
of
far
too
little
importance
for
such
*NL*
exceptional
solemnity
.
But
in
brief
and
coherent
phrases
Raskolnikov
*NL*
explained
his
business
clearly
and
exactly
,
and
was
so
well
satisfied
*NL*
with
himself
that
he
even
succeeded
in
taking
a
good
look
at
Porfiry
.
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
did
not
once
take
his
eyes
off
him
.
Razumihin
,
*NL*
sitting
opposite
at
the
same
table
,
listened
warmly
and
impatiently
,
*NL*
looking
from
one
to
the
other
every
moment
with
rather
excessive
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
,
''
Raskolnikov
swore
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
to
give
information
to
the
police
,
''
Porfiry
replied
,
with
a
*NL*
most
businesslike
air
,
``
that
having
learnt
of
this
incident
,
that
is
of
*NL*
the
murder
,
you
beg
to
inform
the
lawyer
in
charge
of
the
case
that
such
*NL*
and
such
things
belong
to
you
,
and
that
you
desire
to
redeem
them
...
*NL*
or
...
but
they
will
write
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
point
,
that
at
the
present
moment
,
''
Raskolnikov
tried
*NL*
his
utmost
to
feign
embarrassment
,
``
I
am
not
quite
in
funds
...
and
*NL*
even
this
trifling
sum
is
beyond
me
...
I
only
wanted
,
you
see
,
for
*NL*
the
present
to
declare
that
the
things
are
mine
,
and
that
when
I
have
*NL*
money
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
no
matter
,
''
answered
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
receiving
his
*NL*
explanation
of
his
pecuniary
position
coldly
,
``
but
you
can
,
if
you
*NL*
prefer
,
write
straight
to
me
,
to
say
,
that
having
been
informed
of
the
*NL*
matter
,
and
claiming
such
and
such
as
your
property
,
you
beg
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
an
ordinary
sheet
of
paper
?
''
Raskolnikov
interrupted
eagerly
,
again
*NL*
interested
in
the
financial
side
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
most
ordinary
,
''
and
suddenly
Porfiry
Petrovitch
looked
with
*NL*
obvious
irony
at
him
,
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
,
as
it
were
,
winking
at
*NL*
him
.
But
perhaps
it
was
Raskolnikov
's
fancy
,
for
it
all
lasted
but
a
*NL*
moment
.
There
was
certainly
something
of
the
sort
,
Raskolnikov
could
*NL*
have
sworn
he
winked
at
him
,
goodness
knows
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
,
''
flashed
through
his
mind
like
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
my
troubling
you
about
such
trifles
,
''
he
went
on
,
a
little
*NL*
disconcerted
,
``
the
things
are
only
worth
five
roubles
,
but
I
prize
them
*NL*
particularly
for
the
sake
of
those
from
whom
they
came
to
me
,
and
I
must
*NL*
confess
that
I
was
alarmed
when
I
heard
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
you
were
so
much
struck
when
I
mentioned
to
Zossimov
that
*NL*
Porfiry
was
inquiring
for
everyone
who
had
pledges
!
''
Razumihin
put
in
*NL*
with
obvious
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
really
unbearable
.
Raskolnikov
could
not
help
glancing
at
him
*NL*
with
a
flash
of
vindictive
anger
in
his
black
eyes
,
but
immediately
*NL*
recollected
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
be
jeering
at
me
,
brother
?
''
he
said
to
him
,
with
a
*NL*
well-feigned
irritability
.
``
I
dare
say
I
do
seem
to
you
absurdly
anxious
*NL*
about
such
trash
;
but
you
must
n't
think
me
selfish
or
grasping
for
that
,
*NL*
and
these
two
things
may
be
anything
but
trash
in
my
eyes
.
I
told
you
*NL*
just
now
that
the
silver
watch
,
though
it
's
not
worth
a
cent
,
is
the
*NL*
only
thing
left
us
of
my
father
's
.
You
may
laugh
at
me
,
but
my
mother
is
*NL*
here
,
''
he
turned
suddenly
to
Porfiry
,
``
and
if
she
knew
,
''
he
turned
again
*NL*
hurriedly
to
Razumihin
,
carefully
making
his
voice
tremble
,
``
that
the
*NL*
watch
was
lost
,
she
would
be
in
despair
!
You
know
what
women
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
!
I
did
n't
mean
that
at
all
!
Quite
the
contrary
!
''
*NL*
shouted
Razumihin
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
right
?
Was
it
natural
?
Did
I
overdo
it
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
*NL*
himself
in
a
tremor
.
``
Why
did
I
say
that
about
women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
your
mother
is
with
you
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
she
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
paused
as
though
reflecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
things
would
not
in
any
case
be
lost
,
''
he
went
on
calmly
and
*NL*
coldly
.
``
I
have
been
expecting
you
here
for
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
though
that
was
a
matter
of
no
importance
,
he
carefully
offered
*NL*
the
ash-tray
to
Razumihin
,
who
was
ruthlessly
scattering
cigarette
ash
*NL*
over
the
carpet
.
Raskolnikov
shuddered
,
but
Porfiry
did
not
seem
to
be
*NL*
looking
at
him
,
and
was
still
concerned
with
Razumihin
's
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Expecting
him
?
Why
,
did
you
know
that
he
had
pledges
_
there
_
?
''
*NL*
cried
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
addressed
himself
to
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
things
,
the
ring
and
the
watch
,
were
wrapped
up
together
,
and
on
*NL*
the
paper
your
name
was
legibly
written
in
pencil
,
together
with
the
*NL*
date
on
which
you
left
them
with
her
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
observant
you
are
!
''
Raskolnikov
smiled
awkwardly
,
doing
his
very
*NL*
utmost
to
look
him
straight
in
the
face
,
but
he
failed
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
because
I
suppose
there
were
a
great
many
pledges
...
that
it
*NL*
must
be
difficult
to
remember
them
all
...
But
you
remember
them
all
so
*NL*
clearly
,
and
...
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stupid
!
Feeble
!
''
he
thought
.
``
Why
did
I
add
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
know
all
who
had
pledges
,
and
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
n't
*NL*
come
forward
,
''
Porfiry
answered
with
hardly
perceptible
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
been
quite
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
that
too
.
I
heard
,
indeed
,
that
you
were
in
great
distress
*NL*
about
something
.
You
look
pale
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
pale
at
all
...
No
,
I
am
quite
well
,
''
Raskolnikov
snapped
*NL*
out
rudely
and
angrily
,
completely
changing
his
tone
.
His
anger
was
*NL*
mounting
,
he
could
not
repress
it
.
``
And
in
my
anger
I
shall
betray
*NL*
myself
,
''
flashed
through
his
mind
again
.
``
Why
are
they
torturing
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
well
!
''
Razumihin
caught
him
up
.
``
What
next
!
He
was
*NL*
unconscious
and
delirious
all
yesterday
.
Would
you
believe
,
Porfiry
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
our
backs
were
turned
,
he
dressed
,
though
he
could
hardly
stand
,
*NL*
and
gave
us
the
slip
and
went
off
on
a
spree
somewhere
till
midnight
,
*NL*
delirious
all
the
time
!
Would
you
believe
it
!
Extraordinary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
delirious
?
You
do
n't
say
so
!
''
Porfiry
shook
his
head
in
a
*NL*
womanish
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
Do
n't
you
believe
it
!
But
you
do
n't
believe
it
anyway
,
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
let
slip
in
his
anger
.
But
Porfiry
Petrovitch
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
catch
those
strange
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
could
you
have
gone
out
if
you
had
n't
been
delirious
?
''
*NL*
Razumihin
got
hot
suddenly
.
``
What
did
you
go
out
for
?
What
was
the
*NL*
object
of
it
?
And
why
on
the
sly
?
Were
you
in
your
senses
when
you
did
*NL*
it
?
Now
that
all
danger
is
over
I
can
speak
plainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
awfully
sick
of
them
yesterday
.
''
Raskolnikov
addressed
Porfiry
*NL*
suddenly
with
a
smile
of
insolent
defiance
,
``
I
ran
away
from
them
to
*NL*
take
lodgings
where
they
would
n't
find
me
,
and
took
a
lot
of
money
with
*NL*
me
.
Mr.
Zametov
there
saw
it
.
I
say
,
Mr.
Zametov
,
was
I
sensible
or
*NL*
delirious
yesterday
;
settle
our
dispute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
have
strangled
Zametov
at
that
moment
,
so
hateful
were
his
*NL*
expression
and
his
silence
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion
you
talked
sensibly
and
even
artfully
,
but
you
were
*NL*
extremely
irritable

''
Zametov
pronounced
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Nikodim
Fomitch
was
telling
me
to-day
,
''
put
in
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
*NL*
``
that
he
met
you
very
late
last
night
in
the
lodging
of
a
man

had
*NL*
been
run
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
,
''
said
Razumihin
,
``
were
n't
you
mad
then
?
You
gave
your
last
*NL*
penny
to
the
widow
for
the
funeral
.
If
you
wanted
to
help
,
give
fifteen
*NL*
or
twenty
even
,
but
keep
three
roubles
for
yourself
at
least
,

he
*NL*
flung
away
all
the
twenty-five
at
once
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
found
a
treasure
somewhere
and
you
know
nothing

it

So

that
's
why
I
was
liberal
yesterday

Mr.
Zametov
knows
I
've
found
a

treasure

Excuse
us

for
disturbing
you
for
half
an
hour
*NL*

such
trivialities

he
said
,
turning
to
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
with
*NL*
trembling
lips

``
We
are
boring

are
n't
we

*NL*
*NL*

Oh
no

quite
the
contrary

quite
the
contrary

you
knew

you

It
's
interesting
to
look
on
and
listen

I
am
really
*NL*
glad
you
have
come
forward
at
last

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
might
give
us
some
tea

My
throat
's
dry

cried
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
idea

Perhaps
we
will
all
keep
you
company

Would
n't
you
*NL*
like

something
more
essential
before
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
along
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
went
out
to
order
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
.
He
was
in
terrible
exasperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
worst
of
it
is
they
do
n't
disguise
it
;
they
do
n't
care
to
stand
on
*NL*
ceremony
!
And
how
if
you
did
n't
know
me
at
all
,
did
you
come
to
talk
*NL*
to
Nikodim
Fomitch
about
me
?
So
they
do
n't
care
to
hide
that
they
are
*NL*
tracking
me
like
a
pack
of
dogs
.
They
simply
spit
in
my
face
.
''
He
was
*NL*
shaking
with
rage
.
``
Come
,
strike
me
openly
,
do
n't
play
with
me
like
a
*NL*
cat
with
a
mouse

It
's
hardly
civil
,
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
but
perhaps
I
*NL*
wo
n't
allow
it
!
I
shall
get
up
and
throw
the
whole
truth
in
your
ugly
*NL*
faces
,
and
you
'll
see
how
I
despise
you

He
could
hardly
breathe
.
*NL*
``
And
what
if
it
's
only
my
fancy

What
if
I
am
mistaken
,
and
through
*NL*
inexperience
I
get
angry
and
do
n't
keep
up
my
nasty
part
?
Perhaps
it
's
*NL*
all
unintentional
.
All
their
phrases
are
the
usual
ones
,
but
there
is
*NL*
something
about
them
...
It
all
might
be
said
,
but
there
is
something
.
*NL*
Why
did
he
say
bluntly
,
`
With
her
'
?
Why
did
Zametov
add
that
I
spoke
*NL*
artfully
?
Why
do
they
speak
in
that
tone
?
Yes
,
the
tone
...
Razumihin
*NL*
is
sitting
here
,
why
does
he
see
nothing
?
That
innocent
blockhead
never
*NL*
does
see
anything
!
Feverish
again
!
Did
Porfiry
wink
at
me
just
now
?
Of
*NL*
course
it
's
nonsense
!
What
could
he
wink
for
?
Are
they
trying
to
upset
*NL*
my
nerves
or
are
they
teasing
me
?
Either
it
's
ill
fancy
or
they
know
!
*NL*
Even
Zametov
is
rude
...
Is
Zametov
rude
?
Zametov
has
changed
his
mind
.
*NL*
I
foresaw
he
would
change
his
mind
!
He
is
at
home
here
,
while
it
's
my
*NL*
first
visit
.
Porfiry
does
not
consider
him
a
visitor
;
sits
with
his
back
*NL*
to
him
.
They
're
as
thick
as
thieves
,
no
doubt
,
over
me
!
Not
a
doubt
they
*NL*
were
talking
about
me
before
we
came
.
Do
they
know
about
the
flat
?
If
*NL*
only
they
'd
make
haste
!
When
I
said
that
I
ran
away
to
take
a
flat
he
*NL*
let
it
pass
...
I
put
that
in
cleverly
about
a
flat
,
it
may
be
of
use
*NL*
afterwards
...
Delirious
,
indeed
...
ha-ha-ha
!
He
knows
all
about
last
*NL*
night
!
He
did
n't
know
of
my
mother
's
arrival
!
The
hag
had
written
the
*NL*
date
on
in
pencil
!
You
are
wrong
,
you
wo
n't
catch
me
!
There
are
no
*NL*
facts
...
it
's
all
supposition
!
You
produce
facts
!
The
flat
even
is
n't
a
*NL*
fact
but
delirium
.
I
know
what
to
say
to
them
...
Do
they
know
about
the
*NL*
flat
?
I
wo
n't
go
without
finding
out
.
What
did
I
come
for
?
But
my
being
*NL*
angry
now
,
maybe
is
a
fact
!
Fool
,
how
irritable
I
am
!
Perhaps
that
's
*NL*
right
;
to
play
the
invalid
...
He
is
feeling
me
.
He
will
try
to
catch
*NL*
me
.
Why
did
I
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
flashed
like
lightning
through
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
returned
quickly
.
He
became
suddenly
more
jovial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
party
yesterday
,
brother
,
has
left
my
head
rather
...
And
I
am
out
*NL*
of
sorts
altogether

''
he
began
in
quite
a
different
tone
,
laughing
to
*NL*
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
interesting
?
I
left
you
yesterday
at
the
most
interesting
point

*NL*
Who
got
the
best
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
one

of
course

They
got
on
to
everlasting
questions

floated
*NL*
off
into
space

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fancy
,
Rodya
,
what
we
got
on
to
yesterday
.
Whether
there
is
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
crime
.
I
told
you
that
we
talked
our
heads
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
strange
?
It
's
an
everyday
social
question
,
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
answered
casually
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
was
n't
put
quite
like
that
,
''
observed
Porfiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
that
's
true
,
''
Razumihin
agreed
at
once
,
getting
warm
and
*NL*
hurried
as
usual
.
``
Listen
,
Rodion
,
and
tell
us
your
opinion
,
I
want
to
*NL*
hear
it
.
I
was
fighting
tooth
and
nail
with
them
and
wanted
you
to
*NL*
help
me
.
I
told
them
you
were
coming
...
It
began
with
the
socialist
*NL*
doctrine
.
You
know
their
doctrine
;
crime
is
a
protest
against
the
*NL*
abnormality
of
the
social
organisation
and
nothing
more
,
and
nothing
*NL*
more
;
no
other
causes
admitted
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
there
,
''
cried
Porfiry
Petrovitch
;
he
was
noticeably
*NL*
animated
and
kept
laughing
as
he
looked
at
Razumihin
,
which
made
him
*NL*
more
excited
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
admitted
,
''
Razumihin
interrupted
with
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
wrong
.
I
'll
show
you
their
pamphlets
.
Everything
with
them
*NL*
is
`
the
influence
of
environment
,
'
and
nothing
else
.
Their
favourite
*NL*
phrase
!
From
which
it
follows
that
,
if
society
is
normally
organised
,
*NL*
all
crime
will
cease
at
once
,
since
there
will
be
nothing
to
protest
*NL*
against
and
all
men
will
become
righteous
in
one
instant
.
Human
nature
*NL*
is
not
taken
into
account
,
it
is
excluded
,
it
's
not
supposed
to
exist
!
*NL*
They
do
n't
recognise
that
humanity
,
developing
by
a
historical
living
*NL*
process
,
will
become
at
last
a
normal
society
,
but
they
believe
that
a
*NL*
social
system
that
has
come
out
of
some
mathematical
brain
is
going
*NL*
to
organise
all
humanity
at
once
and
make
it
just
and
sinless
in
an
*NL*
instant
,
quicker
than
any
living
process
!
That
's
why
they
instinctively
*NL*
dislike
history
,
`
nothing
but
ugliness
and
stupidity
in
it
,
'
and
they
*NL*
explain
it
all
as
stupidity
!
That
's
why
they
so
dislike
the
_
living
_
*NL*
process
of
life
;
they
do
n't
want
a
_
living
soul
_
!
The
living
soul
*NL*
demands
life
,
the
soul
wo
n't
obey
the
rules
of
mechanics
,
the
soul
is
an
*NL*
object
of
suspicion
,
the
soul
is
retrograde
!
But
what
they
want
though
*NL*
it
smells
of
death
and
can
be
made
of
India-rubber
,
at
least
is
not
*NL*
alive
,
has
no
will
,
is
servile
and
wo
n't
revolt
!
And
it
comes
in
the
end
*NL*
to
their
reducing
everything
to
the
building
of
walls
and
the
planning
*NL*
of
rooms
and
passages
in
a
phalanstery
!
The
phalanstery
is
ready
,
*NL*
indeed
,
but
your
human
nature
is
not
ready
for
the
phalanstery
--
it
*NL*
wants
life
,
it
has
n't
completed
its
vital
process
,
it
's
too
soon
for
the
*NL*
graveyard
!
You
ca
n't
skip
over
nature
by
logic
.
Logic
presupposes
three
*NL*
possibilities
,
but
there
are
millions
!
Cut
away
a
million
,
and
reduce
*NL*
it
all
to
the
question
of
comfort
!
That
's
the
easiest
solution
of
the
*NL*
problem
!
It
's
seductively
clear
and
you
mus
n't
think
about
it
.
That
's
*NL*
the
great
thing
,
you
must
n't
think
!
The
whole
secret
of
life
in
two
*NL*
pages
of
print
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
he
is
off
,
beating
the
drum
!
Catch
hold
of
him
,
do
!
''
laughed
*NL*
Porfiry
.
``
Can
you
imagine
,
''
he
turned
to
Raskolnikov
,
``
six
people
*NL*
holding
forth
like
that
last
night
,
in
one
room
,
with
punch
as
a
*NL*
preliminary
!
No
,
brother
,
you
are
wrong

accounts
for
a
*NL*
great
deal
in
crime
;
I
can
assure
you
of
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
know
it

just
tell
me

him
to
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

strictly
speaking

it
did

''
Porfiry
observed
with
noteworthy
*NL*
gravity
;
``
a

of
that
nature
may
be
very
well
ascribed
to
the
*NL*
influence

*NL*
Razumihin
was
almost
in
a
frenzy
.
``
Oh

you
like

''
he
roared
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
prove
to
you

Ivan

Great

two
hundred

fifty
feet
high

I
*NL*
will
prove

clearly

exactly

progressively

and
even
with
a
Liberal
*NL*
tendency

I
undertake
to

Will
you
bet
on
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Done

Let

hear

how
he
will
prove
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
always
humbugging
,
confound
him

''
cried
Razumihin
,
jumping
up
and
*NL*
gesticulating
.
``
What
's
the
use
of
talking
to
you
?
He
does
all
that

on

He
took
their

delighted

He
can
keep
it
up
for
a

together

Last

he
*NL*
persuaded
us
that
he
was
going
into
a
monastery
:
he
stuck
to
it
for
two
*NL*
months

Not
long
ago
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
declare
he
was
going
*NL*
to
get
married
,
that
he
had
everything
ready
for
the
wedding
.
He
ordered
*NL*
new
clothes
indeed
.
We
all
began
to
congratulate
him
.
There
was
no
*NL*
bride
,
nothing
,
all
pure
fantasy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
wrong

I
got
the

It
was
the
new
clothes

made
me
think
of
taking
you
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
such
a
good

Raskolnikov
asked
carelessly

``

asked
in

astonishment

*NL*
``
Yes

it
was

an

end

I
regret
to

merely
suggested

working

it
out

There
is

a

certain

that

,

have

a
perfect

not

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
smiled
at
the
exaggerated
and
intentional
distortion
of
his
*NL*
idea

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
do
you
mean

A
right
to

But
not

Razumihin
inquired
with
some
alarm
even
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not

answered
Porfiry
.
``

*NL*

``
What
do
you
mean

That

n't
be
right

''
Razumihin
muttered
in
*NL*
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
smiled
again
.
He
saw
the
point
at
once
,
and
knew
where
they
*NL*
wanted
to
drive
him
.
He
decided
to
take
up
the
challenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
n't
quite
my
contention
,
''
he
began
simply
and
modestly
.
``
Yet
*NL*
I
admit
that
you
have
stated
it
almost
correctly

perhaps
,
if
you
like
,
*NL*
perfectly
so

''
-LRB-
It
almost
gave
him
pleasure
to
admit
this
.
-RRB-
``
The
only
*NL*
difference
is
that
I
do
n't
contend
that
extraordinary
people
are
always
*NL*
bound
to
commit
breaches
of
morals
,
as
you
call
it
.
In
fact
,
I
doubt
*NL*
whether
such
an
argument
could
be
published
.
I
simply
hinted
that
an
*NL*
`
extraordinary
'
man
has
the
right
...
that
is
not
an
official
right
,
but
*NL*
an
inner
right
to
decide
in
his
own
conscience
to
overstep
...
certain
*NL*
obstacles
,
and
only
in
case
it
is
essential
for
the
practical
fulfilment
*NL*
of
his
idea

sometimes
,
perhaps
,
of
benefit
to
the
whole

.
*NL*
You
say
that
my
article
is
n't
definite
;
I
am
ready
to
make
it
as
clear
*NL*
as
I
can
.
Perhaps
I
am
right
in
thinking
you
want
me
to
;
very
well
.
I
*NL*
maintain
that
if
the
discoveries
of
Kepler
and
Newton
could
not
have
*NL*
been
made
known
except
by
sacrificing
the
lives
of
one
,
a
dozen
,
a
*NL*
hundred
,
or
more
men
,
Newton
would
have
had
the
right
,
would
indeed
have
*NL*
been
in
duty-bound
...
to
_
eliminate
_
the
dozen
or
the
hundred
men
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
making
his
discoveries
known
to
the
whole
of
humanity
.
But
*NL*
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
Newton
had
a
right
to
murder
people
*NL*
right
and
left
and
to
steal
every
day
in
the
market
.
Then
,
I
remember
,
I
*NL*
maintain
in
my
article
that
all
...
well
,
legislators
and
leaders
of
men
,
*NL*
such
as
Lycurgus
,
Solon
,
Mahomet
,
Napoleon
,
and
so
on
,
were
all
without
*NL*
exception
criminals
,
from
the
very
fact
that
,
making
a
new
law
,
they
*NL*
transgressed
the
ancient
one
,
handed
down
from
their
ancestors
and
held
*NL*
sacred
by
the
people
,
and
they
did
not
stop
short
at
bloodshed
either
,
*NL*
if
that
bloodshed
--
often
of
innocent
persons
fighting
bravely
in
defence
*NL*
of
ancient
law
--
were
of
use
to
their
cause
.
It
's
remarkable
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
that
the
majority
,
indeed
,
of
these
benefactors
and
leaders
of
humanity
*NL*
were
guilty
of
terrible
carnage
.
In
short
,
I
maintain
that
all
great
men
*NL*
or
even
men
a
little
out
of
the
common
,
that
is
to
say
capable
of
giving
*NL*
some
new
word
,
must
from
their
very
nature
be
criminals
--
more
or
less
,
*NL*
of
course
.
Otherwise
it
's
hard
for
them
to
get
out
of
the
common
rut
;
*NL*
and
to
remain
in
the
common
rut
is
what
they
ca
n't
submit
to
,
from
their
*NL*
very
nature
again
,
and
to
my
mind
they
ought
not
,
indeed
,
to
submit
to
*NL*
it
.
You
see
that
there
is
nothing
particularly
new
in
all
that
.
The
*NL*
same
thing
has
been
printed
and
read
a
thousand
times
before
.
As
for
my
*NL*
division
of
people
into
ordinary
and
extraordinary
,
I
acknowledge
that
*NL*
it
's
somewhat
arbitrary
,
but
I
do
n't
insist
upon
exact
numbers
.
I
only
*NL*
believe
in
my
leading
idea
that
men
are
_
in
general
_
divided
by
a
law
*NL*
of
nature
into
two
categories
,
inferior
-LRB-
ordinary
-RRB-
,
that
is
,
so
to
say
,
*NL*
material
that
serves
only
to
reproduce
its
kind
,
and
men
who
have
*NL*
the
gift
or
the
talent
to
utter
_
a
new
word
_
.
There
are
,
of
course
,
*NL*
innumerable
sub-divisions
,
but
the
distinguishing
features
of
both
*NL*
categories
are
fairly
well
marked
.
The
first
category
,
generally
*NL*
speaking
,
are
men
conservative
in
temperament
and
law-abiding
;
they
live
*NL*
under
control
and
love
to
be
controlled
.
To
my
thinking
it
is
their
duty
*NL*
to
be
controlled
,
because
that
's
their
vocation
,
and
there
is
nothing
*NL*
humiliating
in
it
for
them
.
The
second
category
all
transgress
the
*NL*
law
;
they
are
destroyers
or
disposed
to
destruction
according
to
their
*NL*
capacities
.
The
crimes
of
these
men
are
of
course
relative
and
varied
;
*NL*
for
the
most
part
they
seek
in
very
varied
ways
the
destruction
of
the
*NL*
present
for
the
sake
of
the
better
.
But
if
such
a
one
is
forced
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
his
idea
to
step
over
a
corpse
or
wade
through
blood
,
he
can
,
I
*NL*
maintain
,
find
within
himself
,
in
his
conscience
,
a
sanction
for
wading
*NL*
through
blood
--
that
depends
on
the
idea
and
its
dimensions
,
note
that
.
*NL*
It
's
only
in
that
sense
I
speak
of
their
right
to
crime
in
my
article
*NL*
-LRB-
you
remember
it
began
with
the
legal
question
-RRB-
.
There
's
no
need
for
*NL*
such
anxiety
,
however
;
the
masses
will
scarcely
ever
admit
this
right
,
*NL*
they
punish
them
or
hang
them
-LRB-
more
or
less
-RRB-
,
and
in
doing
so
fulfil
*NL*
quite
justly
their
conservative
vocation
.
But
the
same
masses
set
these
*NL*
criminals
on
a
pedestal
in
the
next
generation
and
worship
them
-LRB-
more
or
*NL*
less
-RRB-
.
The
first
category
is
always
the
man
of
the
present
,
the
second
*NL*
the
man
of
the
future
.
The
first
preserve
the
world
and
people
it
,
the
*NL*
second
move
the
world
and
lead
it
to
its
goal
.
Each
class
has
an
equal
*NL*
right
to
exist
.
In
fact
,
all
have
equal
rights
with
me
--
and
_
vive
la
*NL*
guerre
eternelle
_
--
till
the
New
Jerusalem
,
of
course
!

*NL*

``
Then

New
Jerusalem

*NL*

Raskolnikov
answered
firmly
;
as
he
said
these
words
and
during
*NL*
the
whole
preceding
tirade
he
kept
his
eyes
on
one
spot
on
the
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
...
and
do
you
believe
in
God

Excuse
my
curiosity

*NL*
*NL*
``

repeated
Raskolnikov
,
raising
his
eyes
to
Porfiry
.
*NL*
*NL*

let
us

go
back
to
the
question
;
they
are
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

But
tell
me
this
:
how
do
you
distinguish
those
extraordinary

people
from
the
ordinary

Are
there
signs
at
their
birth
?
I
feel
*NL*
there
ought
to
be
more
exactitude

more
external

natural
anxiety
of

a
special
uniform
,
for
instance
,
could
n't

wear
something
,
be

branded
in
some
way
?
For
you
know
if

arises
and
a
member
of
*NL*
one
category
imagines
that
he
belongs
to
the
other
,
begins
to
`
eliminate

so
happily
expressed

...

remark
is
wittier

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
reason
to
;
but
take
note
that
the
mistake
can
only
arise
in
*NL*
the
first
category
,
that
is
among
the
ordinary
people
-LRB-
as
I
perhaps
*NL*
unfortunately
called
them
-RRB-
.
In
spite
of
their
predisposition
to
*NL*
obedience
very
many
of
them
,
through
a
playfulness
of
nature
,
sometimes
*NL*
vouchsafed
even
to
the
cow
,
like
to
imagine
themselves
advanced
people
,
*NL*
`
destroyers
,
'
and
to
push
themselves
into
the
`
new
movement
,
'
and
*NL*
this
quite
sincerely
.
Meanwhile
the
really
_
new
_
people
are
very
often
*NL*
unobserved
by
them
,
or
even
despised
as
reactionaries
of
grovelling
*NL*
tendencies
.
But
I
do
n't
think
there
is
any
considerable
danger
here
,
*NL*
and
you
really
need
not
be
uneasy
for
they
never
go
very
far
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
they
might
have
a
thrashing
sometimes
for
letting
their
fancy
run
away
*NL*
with
them
and
to
teach
them
their
place
,
but
no
more
;
in
fact
,
even
*NL*
this
is
n't
necessary
as
they
castigate
themselves
,
for
they
are
very
*NL*
conscientious
:
some
perform
this
service
for
one
another
and
others
*NL*
chastise
themselves
with
their
own
hands
...
They
will
impose
various
*NL*
public
acts
of
penitence
upon
themselves
with
a
beautiful
and
edifying
*NL*
effect
;
in
fact
you
've
nothing
to
be
uneasy
about
...
It
's
a
law
of
*NL*
nature

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
have
certainly
set
my
mind
more
at
rest
on
that
score
;
but
*NL*
there
's
another
thing
worries
me
.
Tell
me
,
please
,
are
there
many
people
*NL*
who
have
the
right
to
kill
others
,
these
extraordinary
people
?
I
am
*NL*
ready
to
bow
down
to
them
,
of
course
,
but
you
must
admit
it
's
alarming
*NL*
if
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
worry
about
that
either
,
''
Raskolnikov
went
on
in
the
*NL*
same
tone
.
``
People
with
new
ideas
,
people
with
the
faintest
capacity
for
*NL*
saying
something
_
new
_
,
are
extremely
few
in
number
,
extraordinarily
*NL*
so
in
fact
.
One
thing
only
is
clear
,
that
the
appearance
of
all
these
*NL*
grades
and
sub-divisions
of
men
must
follow
with
unfailing
regularity
*NL*
some
law
of
nature
.
That
law
,
of
course
,
is
unknown
at
present
,
but
I
am
*NL*
convinced
that
it
exists
,
and
one
day
may
become
known
.
The
vast
mass
of
*NL*
mankind
is
mere
material
,
and
only
exists
in
order
by
some
great
effort
,
*NL*
by
some
mysterious
process
,
by
means
of
some
crossing
of
races
and
*NL*
stocks
,
to
bring
into
the
world
at
last
perhaps
one
man
out
of
a
*NL*
thousand
with
a
spark
of
independence
.
One
in
ten
thousand
perhaps
--
I
*NL*
speak
roughly
,
approximately
--
is
born
with
some
independence
,
and
with
*NL*
still
greater
independence
one
in
a
hundred
thousand
.
The
man
of
genius
*NL*
is
one
of
millions
,
and
the
great
geniuses
,
the
crown
of
humanity
,
*NL*
appear
on
earth
perhaps
one
in
many
thousand
millions
.
In
fact
I
have
*NL*
not
peeped
into
the
retort
in
which
all
this
takes
place
.
But
there
*NL*
certainly
is
and
must
be
a
definite
law
,
it
can
not
be
a
matter
of
*NL*
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
you
both
joking

Razumihin
cried
at
last

``

making
fun
of
one
another

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
raised
his
pale
and
almost
mournful
face
and
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
And
the
unconcealed
,
persistent
,
nervous
,
and
_
discourteous
_
sarcasm
of
*NL*
Porfiry
seemed
strange
to
Razumihin
beside
that
quiet
and
mournful
face

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Zametov
gave
a
sudden
guffaw
in
his
corner

did
not
even

raise
his

``

have
helped
,
he-he

fancying
yourself
...
*NL*
just
a
little
,
an
`
extraordinary

man
,
uttering
a
_
new
word
_
in
your
*NL*
sense
...
That
's
so
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
possibly
,
''
Raskolnikov
answered
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
made
a
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
if
so
,
could
you
bring
yourself
in
case
of
worldly
difficulties
*NL*
and
hardship
or
for
some
service
to
humanity
--
to
overstep
obstacles
?
...
*NL*
For
instance
,
to
rob
and
murder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
winked
with
his
left
eye
,
and
laughed
noiselessly
just
as
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
I
certainly
should
not
tell
you
,

Raskolnikov
answered
with
*NL*
defiant
and
haughty
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
only
interested
on
account
of
your
article
,
from
a
literary
*NL*
point
of
view

*NL*
*NL*
``
Foo
!
how
obvious
and
insolent
that
is
!
''
Raskolnikov
thought
with
*NL*
repulsion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
observe
,
''
he
answered
dryly
,
``
that
I
do
n't
consider
myself
*NL*
a
Mahomet
or
a
Napoleon
,
nor
any
personage
of
that
kind

and
not
being
*NL*
one
of
them
I
can
not
tell
you
how
I
should
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
do
n't
we
all
think
ourselves
Napoleons
now
in
Russia
?

*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
said
with
alarming
familiarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
peculiar
betrayed
itself
in
the
very
intonation
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
one
of
these
future
Napoleons
who
did
for
Alyona
*NL*
Ivanovna
last
week
?
''
Zametov
blurted
out
from
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
did
not
speak
,
but
looked
firmly
and
intently
at
Porfiry
.
*NL*
Razumihin
was
scowling
gloomily
.
He
seemed
before
this
to
be
noticing
*NL*
something
.
He
looked
angrily
around
.
There
was
a
minute
of
gloomy
*NL*
silence
.
Raskolnikov
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
already
?
''
Porfiry
said
amiably
,
holding
out
his
hand
with
*NL*
excessive
politeness
.
``
Very
,
very
glad
of
your
acquaintance
.
As
for
your
*NL*
request
,
have
no
uneasiness
,
write
just
as
I
told
you
,
or
,
better
still
,
*NL*
come
to
me
there
yourself
in
a
day
or
two
...
to-morrow
,
indeed
.
I
shall
*NL*
be
there
at
eleven
o'clock
for
certain
.
We
'll
arrange
it
all
;
we
'll
have
*NL*
a
talk
.
As
one
of
the
last
to
be
_
there
_
,
you
might
perhaps
be
able
to
*NL*
tell
us
something
,

he
added
with
a
most
good-natured
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
cross-examine
me
officially
in
due
form
?

Raskolnikov
asked
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
?
That
's
not
necessary
for
the
present
.
You
misunderstand
me
.
*NL*
I
lose
no
opportunity
,
you
see
,
and
...
I
've
talked
with
all
who
had
*NL*
pledges
...
I
obtained
evidence
from
some
of
them
,
and
you
are
the
*NL*
last
...
Yes
,
by
the
way
,
''
he
cried
,
seemingly
suddenly
delighted
,
``
I
*NL*
just
remember
,
what
was
I
thinking
of
?
''
he
turned
to
Razumihin
,
``
you
*NL*
were
talking
my
ears
off
about
that
Nikolay
...
of
course
,
I
know

I
know
*NL*
very
well
,

he
turned
to
Raskolnikov
,
``
that
the
fellow
is
innocent
,
but
*NL*
what
is
one
to
do
?
We
had
to
trouble
Dmitri
too
...
This
is
the
point
,
*NL*
this
is
all
:
when
you
went
up
the
stairs
it
was
past
seven
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
,
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
he
spoke
that
he
need
not
have
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
when
you
went
upstairs
between
seven
and
eight
,
did
n't
you
see
in
*NL*
a
flat
that
stood
open
on
a
second
storey
,
do
you
remember
?
two
workmen
*NL*
or
at
least
one
of
them
?
They
were
painting
there
,
did
n't
you
notice
*NL*
them
?
It
's
very
,
very
important
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Painters
?
No
,
I
did
n't
see
them

Raskolnikov
answered
slowly
,
as
*NL*
though
ransacking
his
memory
,
while
at
the
same
instant
he
was
racking
*NL*
every
nerve
,
almost
swooning
with
anxiety
to
conjecture
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
where
the
trap
lay
and
not
to
overlook
anything
.
``
No
,
I
did
n't
*NL*
see
them
,
and
I
do
n't
think
I
noticed
a
flat
like
that
open
...
But
on
*NL*
the
fourth
storey
''
-LRB-
he
had
mastered
the
trap
now
and
was
triumphant
-RRB-
*NL*
``
I
remember
now
that
someone
was
moving
out
of
the
flat
opposite
Alyona
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
...
I
remember
...
I
remember
it
clearly
.
Some
porters
*NL*
were
carrying
out
a
sofa
and
they
squeezed
me
against
the
wall
.
But
*NL*
painters
...
no
,
I
do
n't
remember
that
there
were
any
painters

I
*NL*
do

think
that
there
was
a

open
anywhere

there
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?

Razumihin
shouted
suddenly
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
reflected
and
realised
.
``
Why
,
it
was
on
the
day
of
the
murder
the
*NL*
painters
were
at
work
,
and
he
was
there
three
days
before
?
What
are
you
*NL*
asking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foo
!
I
have
muddled
it
!

Porfiry
slapped
himself
on
the
forehead
.
*NL*
``
Deuce
take
it
!
This
business
is
turning
my
brain
!
''
he
addressed
*NL*
Raskolnikov
somewhat
apologetically
.
``
It
would
be
such
a
great
thing
for
*NL*
us
to
find
out
whether
anyone
had
seen
them
between
seven
and
eight
at
*NL*
the
flat
,
so
I
fancied
you
could
perhaps
have
told
us
something
...
I
*NL*
quite
muddled
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
should
be
more
careful
,
''
Razumihin
observed
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
were
uttered
in
the
passage
.
Porfiry
Petrovitch
saw
them
*NL*
to
the
door
with
excessive
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
into
the
street
gloomy
and
sullen
,
and
for
some
steps
they
*NL*
did
not
say
a
word
.
Raskolnikov
drew
a
deep
breath
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
I
ca
n't
believe
it
!
''
repeated
Razumihin
,
trying
in
*NL*
perplexity
to
refute
Raskolnikov
's
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
by
now
approaching
Bakaleyev
's
lodgings
,
where
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
and
Dounia
had
been
expecting
them
a
long
while
.
Razumihin
*NL*
kept
stopping
on
the
way
in
the
heat
of
discussion
,
confused
and
excited
*NL*
by
the
very
fact
that
they
were
for
the
first
time
speaking
openly
about
*NL*
_
it
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
believe
it
,
then
!
''
answered
Raskolnikov
,
with
a
cold
,
careless
*NL*
smile
.
``
You
were
noticing
nothing
as
usual
,
but
I
was
weighing
every
*NL*
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
suspicious

That
is
why
you
weighed
their
words

h
'm
...
*NL*
certainly
,
I
agree
,
Porfiry
's
tone
was
rather
strange
,
and
still
*NL*
more
that
wretch
Zametov
!
...
You
are
right
,
there
was
something
about
*NL*
him
--
but
why
?
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
changed
his
mind
since
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
the
contrary
!
If
they
had
that
brainless
idea
,
they
would
do
*NL*
their
utmost
to
hide
it
,
and
conceal
their
cards
,
so
as
to
catch
you
*NL*
afterwards
...
But
it
was
all
impudent
and
careless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
had
had
facts
--
I
mean
,
real
facts
--
or
at
least
grounds
for
*NL*
suspicion

then
they
would
certainly
have
tried
to
hide
their
game

*NL*
in
the
hope

getting
more

would
have
made
a
search
long

-RRB-

But
they
have
no
facts

not
one

It
is
all
mirage

all
*NL*
ambiguous

Simply
a
floating
idea

So
they
try
to
throw
me
out
by
*NL*
impudence

And
perhaps
,
he
was
irritated
at
having
no
facts

blurted
*NL*
it
out
in
his
vexation
--
or
perhaps
he
has
some
plan
...
he
seems
an
*NL*
intelligent
man

Perhaps
he
wanted
to
frighten
me
by
pretending
to
*NL*
know

They
have
a
psychology
of
their
own

loathsome

Stop
!

it
's
insulting

insulting

I
understand

spoken
openly

it
is
an
excellent
thing
that
we
have
at
last

I

am
glad

I
will
own
now
frankly

Of

severe
delirious

in
rags

in
boots
without

has
to
*NL*
face
some
wretched
policemen

put
up
with
their
insolence

and
*NL*
the
unexpected
debt
thrust
under
his
nose
,
the
I.O.U.
presented
*NL*
by
Tchebarov
,
the
new
paint

thirty
degrees
Reaumur
and
a
stifling
*NL*
atmosphere

a
crowd
of
people

the
talk
about
the
murder

a
person
*NL*
where
he
had
been
just
before

all
that
on
an
empty

have
a

And
that

annoying
it

still

out

Raskolnikov
answered

reluctance

obvious
disgust

``

why
speak
against
yourself

turn

give
them
another

Porfiry

reckon

be
sure

answer
so

say
I
had
seen

was
*NL*
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
his
own
frankness
,
and
the
eagerness
*NL*
with
which
he
had
made
this
explanation
,
though
he
had
kept
up
all
the
*NL*
preceding
conversation
with
gloomy
repulsion
,
obviously
with
a
motive
,
*NL*
from
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
getting
a
relish
for
certain
aspects
!
''
he
thought
to
himself
.
*NL*
But
almost
at
the
same
instant
he
became
suddenly
uneasy
,
as
though
an
*NL*
unexpected
and
alarming
idea
had
occurred
to
him
.
His
uneasiness
kept
on
*NL*
increasing
.
They
had
just
reached
the
entrance
to
Bakaleyev
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
alone
!
''
said
Raskolnikov
suddenly
.
``
I
will
be
back
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
Why
,
we
are
just
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
...
I
will
come
in
half
an
hour
.
Tell
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
what
you
like
,
I
will
come
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
too
,
want
to
torture
me
!
''
he
screamed
,
with
such
bitter
*NL*
irritation
,
such
despair
in
his
eyes
that
Razumihin
's
hands
dropped
.
*NL*
He
stood
for
some
time
on
the
steps
,
looking
gloomily
at
Raskolnikov
*NL*
striding
rapidly
away
in
the
direction
of
his
lodging
.
At
last
,
gritting
*NL*
his
teeth
and
clenching
his
fist
,
he
swore
he
would
squeeze
Porfiry
*NL*
like
a
lemon
that
very
day
,
and
went
up
the
stairs
to
reassure
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
who
was
by
now
alarmed
at
their
long
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Raskolnikov
got
home
,
his
hair
was
soaked
with
sweat
and
he
was
*NL*
breathing
heavily
.
He
went
rapidly
up
the
stairs
,
walked
into
his
*NL*
unlocked
room
and
at
once
fastened
the
latch
.
Then
in
senseless
terror
*NL*
he
rushed
to
the
corner
,
to
that
hole
under
the
paper
where
he
had
put
*NL*
the
things
;
put
his
hand
in
,
and
for
some
minutes
felt
carefully
in
the
*NL*
hole
,
in
every
crack
and
fold
of
the
paper
.
Finding
nothing
,
he
got
up
*NL*
and
drew
a
deep
breath
.
As
he
was
reaching
the
steps
of
Bakaleyev
's
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
fancied
that
something
,
a
chain
,
a
stud
or
even
a
bit
of
paper
*NL*
in
which
they
had
been
wrapped
with
the
old
woman
's
handwriting
on
it
,
*NL*
might
somehow
have
slipped
out
and
been
lost
in
some
crack
,
and
then
*NL*
might
suddenly
turn
up
as
unexpected
,
conclusive
evidence
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
as
though
lost
in
thought
,
and
a
strange
,
humiliated
,
half
*NL*
senseless
smile
strayed
on
his
lips
.
He
took
his
cap
at
last
and
went
*NL*
quietly
out
of
the
room
.
His
ideas
were
all
tangled
.
He
went
dreamily
*NL*
through
the
gateway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
himself
,
''
shouted
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
was
standing
at
the
door
of
his
little
room
and
was
pointing
*NL*
him
out
to
a
short
man
who
looked
like
an
artisan
,
wearing
a
long
coat
*NL*
and
a
waistcoat
,
and
looking
at
a
distance
remarkably
like
a
woman
.
He
*NL*
stooped
,
and
his
head
in
a
greasy
cap
hung
forward
.
From
his
wrinkled
*NL*
flabby
face
he
looked
over
fifty
;
his
little
eyes
were
lost
in
fat
and
*NL*
they
looked
out
grimly
,
sternly
and
discontentedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
,
going
up
to
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
stole
a
look
at
him
from
under
his
brows
and
he
looked
at
him
*NL*
attentively
,
deliberately
;
then
he
turned
slowly
and
went
out
of
the
*NL*
gate
into
the
street
without
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
there
was
asking
whether
a
student
lived
here
,
mentioned
your
*NL*
name
and
whom
you
lodged
with
.
I
saw
you
coming
and
pointed
you
out
and
*NL*
he
went
away
.
It
's
funny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
too
seemed
rather
puzzled
,
but
not
much
so
,
and
after
*NL*
wondering
for
a
moment
he
turned
and
went
back
to
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
ran
after
the
stranger
,
and
at
once
caught
sight
of
*NL*
him
walking
along
the
other
side
of
the
street
with
the
same
even
,
*NL*
deliberate
step
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
,
as
though
in
*NL*
meditation
.
He
soon
overtook
him
,
but
for
some
time
walked
behind
him
.
*NL*
At
last
,
moving
on
to
a
level
with
him
,
he
looked
at
his
face
.
The
man
*NL*
noticed
him
at
once
,
looked
at
him
quickly
,
but
dropped
his
eyes
again
;
*NL*
and
so
they
walked
for
a
minute
side
by
side
without
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
inquiring
for
me
...
of
the
porter
?
''
Raskolnikov
said
at
last
,
*NL*
but
in
a
curiously
quiet
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
made
no
answer
;
he
did
n't
even
look
at
him
.
Again
they
were
both
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
...
come
and
ask
for
me
...
and
say
nothing
...
What
's
the
*NL*
meaning
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
voice
broke
and
he
seemed
unable
to
articulate
the
words
*NL*
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
raised
his
eyes
this
time
and
turned
a
gloomy
sinister
look
at
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murderer
!
''
he
said
suddenly
in
a
quiet
but
clear
and
distinct
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
on
walking
beside
him
.
His
legs
felt
suddenly
weak
,
a
*NL*
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
,
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
then
suddenly
began
throbbing
as
though
it
were
set
free
.
So
*NL*
they
walked
for
about
a
hundred
paces
,
side
by
side
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
did
not
look
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
...
what
is
...
Who
is
a
murderer
?
''
muttered
*NL*
Raskolnikov
hardly
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
are
a
murderer
,
''
the
man
answered
still
more
articulately
and
*NL*
emphatically
,
with
a
smile
of
triumphant
hatred
,
and
again
he
looked
*NL*
straight
into
Raskolnikov
's
pale
face
and
stricken
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
just
reached
the
cross-roads
.
The
man
turned
to
the
left
*NL*
without
looking
behind
him
.
Raskolnikov
remained
standing
,
gazing
after
*NL*
him
.
He
saw
him
turn
round
fifty
paces
away
and
look
back
at
him
still
*NL*
standing
there
.
Raskolnikov
could
not
see
clearly
,
but
he
fancied
that
*NL*
he
was
again
smiling
the
same
smile
of
cold
hatred
and
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
slow
faltering
steps
,
with
shaking
knees
,
Raskolnikov
made
his
way
*NL*
back
to
his
little
garret
,
feeling
chilled
all
over
.
He
took
off
his
cap
*NL*
and
put
it
on
the
table
,
and
for
ten
minutes
he
stood
without
moving
.
*NL*
Then
he
sank
exhausted
on
the
sofa
and
with
a
weak
moan
of
pain
he
*NL*
stretched
himself
on
it
.
So
he
lay
for
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
nothing
.
Some
thoughts
or
fragments
of
thoughts
,
some
*NL*
images
without
order
or
coherence
floated
before
his
mind
--
faces
of
*NL*
people
he
had
seen
in
his
childhood
or
met
somewhere
once
,
whom
he
would
*NL*
never
have
recalled
,
the
belfry
of
the
church
at
V.
,
the
billiard
table
*NL*
in
a
restaurant
and
some
officers
playing
billiards
,
the
smell
of
cigars
*NL*
in
some
underground
tobacco
shop
,
a
tavern
room
,
a
back
staircase
quite
*NL*
dark
,
all
sloppy
with
dirty
water
and
strewn
with
egg-shells
,
and
the
*NL*
Sunday
bells
floating
in
from
somewhere
...
The
images
followed
one
*NL*
another
,
whirling
like
a
hurricane
.
Some
of
them
he
liked
and
tried
*NL*
to
clutch
at
,
but
they
faded
and
all
the
while
there
was
an
oppression
*NL*
within
him
,
but
it
was
not
overwhelming
,
sometimes
it
was
even
*NL*
pleasant
...
The
slight
shivering
still
persisted
,
but
that
too
*NL*
was
an
almost
pleasant
sensation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
hurried
footsteps
of
Razumihin
;
he
closed
his
eyes
and
*NL*
pretended
to
be
asleep
.
Razumihin
opened
the
door
and
stood
for
some
*NL*
time
in
the
doorway
as
though
hesitating
,
then
he
stepped
softly
into
*NL*
the
room
and
went
cautiously
to
the
sofa
.
Raskolnikov
heard
Nastasya
's
*NL*
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
disturb
him
!
Let
him
sleep
.
He
can
have
his
dinner
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
''
answered
Razumihin
.
Both
withdrew
carefully
and
closed
the
*NL*
door
.
Another
half-hour
passed
.
Raskolnikov
opened
his
eyes
,
turned
on
*NL*
his
back
again
,
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
Who
is
that
man
who
sprang
out
of
the
earth
?
Where
was
he
,
*NL*
what
did
he
see
?
He
has
seen
it
all
,
that
's
clear
.
Where
was
he
then
?
*NL*
And
from
where
did
he
see
?
Why
has
he
only
now
sprung
out
of
the
earth
?
*NL*
And
how
could
he
see
?
Is
it
possible
?
Hm
...
''
continued
Raskolnikov
,
*NL*
turning
cold
and
shivering
,
``
and
the
jewel
case
Nikolay
found
behind
the
*NL*
door
--
was
that
possible
?
A
clue
?
You
miss
an
infinitesimal
line
and
you
*NL*
can
build
it
into
a
pyramid
of
evidence
!
A
fly
flew
by
and
saw
it
!
Is
it
*NL*
possible
?
''
He
felt
with
sudden
loathing
how
weak
,
how
physically
weak
he
*NL*
had
become
.
``
I
ought
to
have
known
it
,
''
he
thought
with
a
bitter
smile
.
*NL*
``
And
how
dared
I
,
knowing
myself
,
knowing
how
I
should
be
,
take
up
an
*NL*
axe
and
shed
blood
!
I
ought
to
have
known
beforehand
...
Ah
,
but
I
did
*NL*
know
!
''
he
whispered
in
despair
.
At
times
he
came
to
a
standstill
at
some
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
those
men
are
not
made
so
.
The
real
_
Master
_
to
whom
all
is
*NL*
permitted
storms
Toulon
,
makes
a
massacre
in
Paris
,
_
forgets
_
an
army
in
*NL*
Egypt
,
_
wastes
_
half
a
million
men
in
the
Moscow
expedition
and
gets
off
*NL*
with
a
jest
at
Vilna
.
And
altars
are
set
up
to
him
after
his
death
,
and
*NL*
so
_
all
_
is
permitted
.
No
,
such
people
,
it
seems
,
are
not
of
flesh
but
*NL*
of
bronze
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
sudden
irrelevant
idea
almost
made
him
laugh
.
Napoleon
,
the
*NL*
pyramids
,
Waterloo
,
and
a
wretched
skinny
old
woman
,
a
pawnbroker
with
*NL*
a
red
trunk
under
her
bed
--
it
's
a
nice
hash
for
Porfiry
Petrovitch
to
*NL*
digest
!
How
can
they
digest
it
!
It
's
too
inartistic
.
``
A
Napoleon
creep
*NL*
under
an
old
woman
's
bed
!
Ugh
,
how
loathsome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
moments
he
felt
he
was
raving
.
He
sank
into
a
state
of
feverish
*NL*
excitement
.
``
The
old
woman
is
of
no
consequence
,
''
he
thought
,
hotly
and
*NL*
incoherently
.
``
The
old
woman
was
a
mistake
perhaps
,
but
she
is
not
*NL*
what
matters
!
The
old
woman
was
only
an
illness
...
I
was
in
a
hurry
to
*NL*
overstep
...
I
did
n't
kill
a
human
being
,
but
a
principle
!
I
killed
the
*NL*
principle
,
but
I
did
n't
overstep
,
I
stopped
on
this
side
...
I
was
*NL*
only
capable
of
killing
.
And
it
seems
I
was
n't
even
capable
of
that
...
*NL*
Principle
?
Why
was
that
fool
Razumihin
abusing
the
socialists
?
They
are
*NL*
industrious
,
commercial
people
;
`
the
happiness
of
all
'
is
their
case
.
*NL*
No
,
life
is
only
given
to
me
once
and
I
shall
never
have
it
again
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
wait
for
`
the
happiness
of
all
.
'
I
want
to
live
myself
,
*NL*
or
else
better
not
live
at
all
.
I
simply
could
n't
pass
by
my
mother
*NL*
starving
,
keeping
my
rouble
in
my
pocket
while
I
waited
for
the
*NL*
`
happiness
of
all
.
'
I
am
putting
my
little
brick
into
the
happiness
of
*NL*
all
and
so
my
heart
is
at
peace
.
Ha-ha
!
Why
have
you
let
me
slip
?
I
only
*NL*
live
once
,
I
too
want
...
Ech
,
I
am
an
aesthetic
louse
and
nothing
*NL*
more
,
''
he
added
suddenly
,
laughing
like
a
madman
.
``
Yes
,
I
am
certainly
a
*NL*
louse
,
''
he
went
on
,
clutching
at
the
idea
,
gloating
over
it
and
playing
*NL*
with
it
with
vindictive
pleasure
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
because
I
can
*NL*
reason
that
I
am
one
,
and
secondly
,
because
for
a
month
past
I
have
been
*NL*
troubling
benevolent
Providence
,
calling
it
to
witness
that
not
for
*NL*
my
own
fleshly
lusts
did
I
undertake
it
,
but
with
a
grand
and
noble
*NL*
object
--
ha-ha
!
Thirdly
,
because
I
aimed
at
carrying
it
out
as
justly
as
*NL*
possible
,
weighing
,
measuring
and
calculating
.
Of
all
the
lice
I
picked
*NL*
out
the
most
useless
one
and
proposed
to
take
from
her
only
as
much
as
I
*NL*
needed
for
the
first
step
,
no
more
nor
less
-LRB-
so
the
rest
would
have
gone
*NL*
to
a
monastery
,
according
to
her
will
,
ha-ha
!
-RRB-
.
And
what
shows
that
I
*NL*
am
utterly
a
louse
,
''
he
added
,
grinding
his
teeth
,
``
is
that
I
am
*NL*
perhaps
viler
and
more
loathsome
than
the
louse
I
killed
,
and
_
I
felt
*NL*
beforehand
_
that
I
should
tell
myself
so
_
after
_
killing
her
.
Can
*NL*
anything
be
compared
with
the
horror
of
that
?
The
vulgarity
!
The
*NL*
abjectness
!
I
understand
the

The

is
*NL*
right
,
he
is
right
when
he
sets
a
battery
across
the
street
and
blows
up
*NL*
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
without
deigning
to
explain
!
It
's
for
you
to

not

to
have
desires

for
that

not

you

I
shall
never

never
forgive
the

*NL*
*NL*
His
hair
was
soaked
with
sweat
,
his
quivering
lips
were
parched
,
his
*NL*
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
sister
--
how
I
loved
them
!
Why
do
I
hate
them
now

Yes
,
I
hate
*NL*
them
,
I
feel
a
physical
hatred
for
them
,
I
ca
n't
bear
them
near
me
...
*NL*
I
went
up
to
my
mother
and
kissed
her
,
I
remember
...
To
embrace
her
*NL*
and
think
if
she
only
knew
...
shall
I
tell
her
then
?
That
's
just
what
*NL*
I
might
do
...
_
She
_
must
be
the

as
I
am

''
he
added
,
straining
*NL*
himself
to
think
,
as
it
were
struggling
with
delirium
.
``
Ah
,
how
I
hate
*NL*
the
old
woman
now

I
feel
I
should
kill
her
again
if
she
came
to
life

*NL*
Poor
Lizaveta

Why
did
she
come
in

It
's
strange

,
why
is
it

I
scarcely
ever
think
of
her

I

killed

*NL*
*NL*
He
lost
consciousness
;
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
did
n't
remember
*NL*
how
he
got
into
the
street
.
It
was
late
evening
.
The
twilight
had
fallen
*NL*
and
the
full
moon
was
shining
more
and
more
brightly
;
but
there
was
a
*NL*
peculiar
breathlessness
in
the
air
.
There
were
crowds
of
people
in
the
*NL*
street
;
workmen
and
business
people
were
making
their
way
home
;
other
*NL*
people
had
come
out
for
a
walk
;
there
was
a
smell
of
mortar
,
dust
and
*NL*
stagnant
water
.
Raskolnikov
walked
along
,
mournful
and
anxious
;
he
was
*NL*
distinctly
aware
of
having
come
out
with
a
purpose
,
of
having
to
do
*NL*
something
in
a
hurry
,
but
what
it
was
he
had
forgotten
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
stood
still
and
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
*NL*
beckoning
to
him
.
He
crossed
over
to
him
,
but
at
once
the
man
turned
and
*NL*
walked
away
with
his
head
hanging
,
as
though
he
had
made
no
sign
to
*NL*
him
.
``
Stay
,
did
he
really
beckon
?
''
Raskolnikov
wondered
,
but
he
tried
*NL*
to
overtake
him
.
When
he
was
within
ten
paces
he
recognised
him
and
*NL*
was
frightened
;
it
was
the
same
man
with
stooping
shoulders
in
the
long
*NL*
coat
.
Raskolnikov
followed
him
at
a
distance
;
his
heart
was
beating
;
*NL*
they
went
down
a
turning
;
the
man
still
did
not
look
round
.
``
Does
he
*NL*
know
I
am
following
him
?
''
thought
Raskolnikov
.
The
man
went
into
the
*NL*
gateway
of
a
big
house
.
Raskolnikov
hastened
to
the
gate
and
looked
in
*NL*
to
see
whether
he
would
look
round
and
sign
to
him
.
In
the
court-yard
*NL*
the
man
did
turn
round
and
again
seemed
to
beckon
him
.
Raskolnikov
at
*NL*
once
followed
him
into
the
yard
,
but
the
man
was
gone
.
He
must
have
*NL*
gone
up
the
first
staircase
.
Raskolnikov
rushed
after
him
.
He
heard
*NL*
slow
measured
steps
two
flights
above
.
The
staircase
seemed
strangely
*NL*
familiar
.
He
reached
the
window
on
the
first
floor
;
the
moon
shone
*NL*
through
the
panes
with
a
melancholy
and
mysterious
light
;
then
he
*NL*
reached
the
second
floor
.
Bah
!
this
is
the
flat
where
the
painters
were
*NL*
at
work
...
but
how
was
it
he
did
not
recognise
it
at
once
?
The
steps
*NL*
of
the
man
above
had
died
away
.
``
So
he
must
have
stopped
or
hidden
*NL*
somewhere
.
''
He
reached
the
third
storey
,
should
he
go
on
?
There
was
a
*NL*
stillness
that
was
dreadful
...
But
he
went
on
.
The
sound
of
his
own
*NL*
footsteps
scared
and
frightened
him
.
How
dark
it
was
!
The
man
must
be
*NL*
hiding
in
some
corner
here
.
Ah
!
the
flat
was
standing
wide
open
,
he
*NL*
hesitated
and
went
in
.
It
was
very
dark
and
empty
in
the
passage
,
as
*NL*
though
everything
had
been
removed
;
he
crept
on
tiptoe
into
the
parlour
*NL*
which
was
flooded
with
moonlight
.
Everything
there
was
as
before
,
the
*NL*
chairs
,
the
looking-glass
,
the
yellow
sofa
and
the
pictures
in
the
*NL*
frames
.
A
huge
,
round
,
copper-red
moon
looked
in
at
the
windows
.
*NL*
``
It
's
the
moon
that
makes
it
so
still
,
weaving
some
mystery
,
''
thought
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
He
stood
and
waited
,
waited
a
long
while
,
and
the
more
*NL*
silent
the
moonlight
,
the
more
violently
his
heart
beat
,
till
it
was
*NL*
painful
.
And
still
the
same
hush
.
Suddenly
he
heard
a
momentary
sharp
*NL*
crack
like
the
snapping
of
a
splinter
and
all
was
still
again
.
A
fly
*NL*
flew
up
suddenly
and
struck
the
window
pane
with
a
plaintive
buzz
.
At
*NL*
that
moment
he
noticed
in
the
corner
between
the
window
and
the
little
*NL*
cupboard
something
like
a
cloak
hanging
on
the
wall
.
``
Why
is
that
cloak
*NL*
here
?
''
he
thought
,
``
it
was
n't
there
before
...
''
He
went
up
to
it
quietly
*NL*
and
felt
that
there
was
someone
hiding
behind
it
.
He
cautiously
moved
*NL*
the
cloak
and
saw
,
sitting
on
a
chair
in
the
corner
,
the
old
woman
bent
*NL*
double
so
that
he
could
n't
see
her
face
;
but
it
was
she
.
He
stood
over
*NL*
her
.
``
She
is
afraid
,
''
he
thought
.
He
stealthily
took
the
axe
from
the
*NL*
noose
and
struck
her
one
blow
,
then
another
on
the
skull
.
But
strange
*NL*
to
say
she
did
not
stir
,
as
though
she
were
made
of
wood
.
He
was
*NL*
frightened
,
bent
down
nearer
and
tried
to
look
at
her
;
but
she
,
too
,
*NL*
bent
her
head
lower
.
He
bent
right
down
to
the
ground
and
peeped
up
*NL*
into
her
face
from
below
,
he
peeped
and
turned
cold
with
horror
:
the
old
*NL*
woman
was
sitting
and
laughing
,
shaking
with
noiseless
laughter
,
doing
*NL*
her
utmost
that
he
should
not
hear
it
.
Suddenly
he
fancied
that
the
door
*NL*
from
the
bedroom
was
opened
a
little
and
that
there
was
laughter
and
*NL*
whispering
within
.
He
was
overcome
with
frenzy
and
he
began
hitting
the
*NL*
old
woman
on
the
head
with
all
his
force
,
but
at
every
blow
of
the
axe
*NL*
the
laughter
and
whispering
from
the
bedroom
grew
louder
and
the
old
*NL*
woman
was
simply
shaking
with
mirth
.
He
was
rushing
away
,
but
the
*NL*
passage
was
full
of
people
,
the
doors
of
the
flats
stood
open
and
on
the
*NL*
landing
,
on
the
stairs
and
everywhere
below
there
were
people
,
rows
of
*NL*
heads
,
all
looking
,
but
huddled
together
in
silence
and
expectation
.
*NL*
Something
gripped
his
heart
,
his
legs
were
rooted
to
the
spot
,
they
*NL*
would
not
move
...
He
tried
to
scream
and
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
deep
breath
--
but
his
dream
seemed
strangely
to
persist
:
*NL*
his
door
was
flung
open
and
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
stood
in
the
*NL*
doorway
watching
him
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
hardly
opened
his
eyes
and
he
instantly
closed
them
*NL*
again
.
He
lay
on
his
back
without
stirring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
still
a
dream
?
''
he
wondered
and
again
raised
his
eyelids
hardly
*NL*
perceptibly
;
the
stranger
was
standing
in
the
same
place
,
still
watching
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
cautiously
into
the
room
,
carefully
closing
the
door
after
*NL*
him
,
went
up
to
the
table
,
paused
a
moment
,
still
keeping
his
eyes
on
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
and
noiselessly
seated
himself
on
the
chair
by
the
sofa
;
he
*NL*
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
leaned
his
hands
on
his
cane
*NL*
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
.
It
was
evident
that
he
was
prepared
to
wait
*NL*
indefinitely
.
As
far
as
Raskolnikov
could
make
out
from
his
stolen
*NL*
glances
,
he
was
a
man
no
longer
young
,
stout
,
with
a
full
,
fair
,
almost
*NL*
whitish
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
minutes
passed
.
It
was
still
light
,
but
beginning
to
get
dusk
.
There
*NL*
was
complete
stillness
in
the
room
.
Not
a
sound
came
from
the
stairs
.
*NL*
Only
a
big
fly
buzzed
and
fluttered
against
the
window
pane
.
It
was
*NL*
unbearable
at
last
.
Raskolnikov
suddenly
got
up
and
sat
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
tell
me
what
you
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
were
not
asleep
,
but
only
pretending
,
''
the
stranger
answered
*NL*
oddly
,
laughing
calmly
.
``
Arkady
Ivanovitch
Svidrigailov
,
allow
me
to
*NL*
introduce
myself

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
this
be
still
a
dream
?
''
Raskolnikov
thought
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
carefully
and
suspiciously
at
the
unexpected
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Svidrigailov
!
What
nonsense
!
It
ca
n't
be
!
''
he
said
at
last
aloud
in
*NL*
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
visitor
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
at
this
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
you
for
two
reasons
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
wanted
to
make
*NL*
your
personal
acquaintance
,
as
I
have
already
heard
a
great
deal
about
*NL*
you
that
is
interesting
and
flattering
;
secondly
,
I
cherish
the
hope
*NL*
that
you
may
not
refuse
to
assist
me
in
a
matter
directly
concerning
the
*NL*
welfare
of
your
sister
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
For
without
your
support
she
*NL*
might
not
let
me
come
near
her
now
,
for
she
is
prejudiced
against
me
,
*NL*
but
with
your
assistance
I
reckon
on
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
reckon
wrongly
,
''
interrupted
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
only
arrived
yesterday
,
may
I
ask
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
yesterday
,
I
know
.
I
only
arrived
myself
the
day
before
.
Well
,
*NL*
let
me
tell
you
this
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
I
do
n't
consider
it
necessary
*NL*
to
justify
myself
,
but
kindly
tell
me
what
was
there
particularly
*NL*
criminal
on
my
part
in
all
this
business
,
speaking
without
prejudice
,
*NL*
with
common
sense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
continued
to
look
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
in
my
own
house
I
persecuted
a
defenceless
girl
and
`
insulted
her
*NL*
with
my
infamous
proposals
'
--
is
that
it
?
-LRB-
I
am
anticipating
you
.
-RRB-
But
*NL*
you
've
only
to
assume
that
I
,
too
,
am
a
man
_
et
nihil
humanum
_
...
in
a
*NL*
word
,
that
I
am
capable
of
being
attracted
and
falling
in
love
-LRB-
which
*NL*
does
not
depend
on
our
will
-RRB-
,
then
everything
can
be
explained
in
the
*NL*
most
natural
manner
.
The
question
is
,
am
I
a
monster
,
or
am
I
myself
*NL*
a
victim
?
And
what
if
I
am
a
victim
?
In
proposing
to
the
object
of
my
*NL*
passion
to
elope
with
me
to
America
or
Switzerland
,
I
may
have
cherished
*NL*
the
deepest
respect
for
her
and
may
have
thought
that
I
was
promoting
*NL*
our
mutual
happiness
!
Reason
is
the
slave
of
passion
,
you
know
;
why
,
*NL*
probably
,
I
was
doing
more
harm
to
myself
than
anyone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
not
the
point
,
''
Raskolnikov
interrupted
with
disgust
.
``
It
's
*NL*
simply
that
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
,
we
dislike
you
.
We
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
.
We
show
you
the
door
.
Go
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
...
but
there
's
no
getting
round
you
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
in
*NL*
the
frankest
way
.
``
I
hoped
to
get
round
you
,
but
you
took
up
the
right
*NL*
line
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
trying
to
get
round
me
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
it
?
What
of
it
?
''
cried
Svidrigailov
,
laughing
openly
.
``
But
this
*NL*
is
what
the
French
call
_
bonne
guerre
_
,
and
the
most
innocent
form
of
*NL*
deception
!
...
But
still
you
have
interrupted
me
;
one
way
or
another
,
I
*NL*
repeat
again
:
there
would
never
have
been
any
unpleasantness
except
for
*NL*
what
happened
in
the
garden
.
Marfa
Petrovna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
got
rid
of
Marfa
Petrovna
,
too
,
so
they
say
?
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
interrupted
rudely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
've
heard
that
,
too
,
then
?
You
'd
be
sure
to
,
though
...
But
*NL*
as
for
your
question
,
I
really
do
n't
know
what
to
say
,
though
my
own
*NL*
conscience
is
quite
at
rest
on
that
score
.
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
am
in
*NL*
any
apprehension
about
it
.
All
was
regular
and
in
order
;
the
medical
*NL*
inquiry
diagnosed
apoplexy
due
to
bathing
immediately
after
a
heavy
*NL*
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
wine
,
and
indeed
it
could
have
proved
nothing
*NL*
else
.
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
have
been
thinking
to
myself
of
late
,
on
*NL*
my
way
here
in
the
train
,
especially
:
did
n't
I
contribute
to
all
that
...
*NL*
calamity
,
morally
,
in
a
way
,
by
irritation
or
something
of
the
*NL*
sort
.
But
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
,
too
,
was
quite
out
of
the
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
trouble
yourself
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
laughing
at
?
Only
consider
,
I
struck
her
just
twice
*NL*
with
a
switch
--
there
were
no
marks
even
...
do
n't
regard
me
as
a
cynic
,
*NL*
please
;
I
am
perfectly
aware
how
atrocious
it
was
of
me
and
all
that
;
*NL*
but
I
know
for
certain
,
too
,
that
Marfa
Petrovna
was
very
likely
pleased
*NL*
at
my
,
so
to
say
,
warmth
.
The
story
of
your
sister
had
been
wrung
out
to
*NL*
the
last
drop
;
for
the
last
three
days
Marfa
Petrovna
had
been
forced
to
*NL*
sit
at
home
;
she
had
nothing
to
show
herself
with
in
the
town
.
Besides
,
*NL*
she
had
bored
them
so
with
that
letter
-LRB-
you
heard
about
her
reading
the
*NL*
letter
-RRB-
.
And
all
of
a
sudden
those
two
switches
fell
from
heaven
!
Her
*NL*
first
act
was
to
order
the
carriage
to
be
got
out
...
Not
to
speak
*NL*
of
the
fact
that
there
are
cases
when
women
are
very
,
very
glad
to
be
*NL*
insulted
in
spite
of
all
their
show
of
indignation
.
There
are
instances
*NL*
of
it
with
everyone
;
human
beings
in
general
,
indeed
,
greatly
love
to
*NL*
be
insulted
,
have
you
noticed
that
?
But
it
's
particularly
so
with
women
.
*NL*
One
might
even
say
it
's
their
only
amusement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
time
Raskolnikov
thought
of
getting
up
and
walking
out
and
so
*NL*
finishing
the
interview
.
But
some
curiosity
and
even
a
sort
of
prudence
*NL*
made
him
linger
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
fond
of
fighting
?
''
he
asked
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
very
,
''
Svidrigailov
answered
,
calmly
.
``
And
Marfa
Petrovna
and
*NL*
I
scarcely
ever
fought
.
We
lived
very
harmoniously
,
and
she
was
always
*NL*
pleased
with
me
.
I
only
used
the
whip
twice
in
all
our
seven
years
-LRB-
not
*NL*
counting
a
third
occasion
of
a
very
ambiguous
character
-RRB-
.
The
first
*NL*
time
,
two
months
after
our
marriage
,
immediately
after
we
arrived
in
the
*NL*
country
,
and
the
last
time
was
that
of
which
we
are
speaking
.
Did
you
*NL*
suppose
I
was
such
a
monster
,
such
a
reactionary
,
such
a
slave
driver
?
*NL*
Ha
,
ha
!
By
the
way
,
do
you
remember
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
how
a
few
years
*NL*
ago
,
in
those
days
of
beneficent
publicity
,
a
nobleman
,
I
've
forgotten
*NL*
his
name
,
was
put
to
shame
everywhere
,
in
all
the
papers
,
for
having
*NL*
thrashed
a
German
woman
in
the
railway
train
.
You
remember
?
It
was
in
*NL*
those
days
,
that
very
year
I
believe
,
the
`
disgraceful
action
of
the
*NL*
_
Age
_
'
took
place
-LRB-
you
know
,
`
The
Egyptian
Nights
,
'
that
public
reading
,
*NL*
you
remember
?
The
dark
eyes
,
you
know
!
Ah
,
the
golden
days
of
our
youth
,
*NL*
where
are
they
?
-RRB-
.
Well
,
as
for
the
gentleman
who
thrashed
the
German
,
*NL*
I
feel
no
sympathy
with
him
,
because
after
all
what
need
is
there
*NL*
for
sympathy
?
But
I
must
say
that
there
are
sometimes
such
provoking
*NL*
`
Germans
'
that
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
a
progressive
who
could
quite
*NL*
answer
for
himself
.
No
one
looked
at
the
subject
from
that
point
of
view
*NL*
then
,
but
that
's
the
truly
humane
point
of
view
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
saying
this
,
Svidrigailov
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
again
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
saw
clearly
that
this
was
a
man
with
a
firm
purpose
in
his
*NL*
mind
and
able
to
keep
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
you
've
not
talked
to
anyone
for
some
days
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scarcely
anyone
.
I
suppose
you
are
wondering
at
my
being
such
an
*NL*
adaptable
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
only
wondering
at
your
being
too
adaptable
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
not
offended
at
the
rudeness
of
your
questions
?
Is
that
*NL*
it
?
But
why
take
offence
?
As
you
asked
,
so
I
answered
,
''
he
replied
,
*NL*
with
a
surprising
expression
of
simplicity
.
``
You
know
,
there
's
*NL*
hardly
anything
I
take
interest
in
,
''
he
went
on
,
as
it
were
dreamily
,
*NL*
``
especially
now
,
I
've
nothing
to
do
...
You
are
quite
at
liberty
to
*NL*
imagine
though
that
I
am
making
up
to
you
with
a
motive
,
particularly
as
*NL*
I
told
you
I
want
to
see
your
sister
about
something
.
But
I
'll
confess
*NL*
frankly
,
I
am
very
much
bored
.
The
last
three
days
especially
,
so
I
am
*NL*
delighted
to
see
you
...
Do
n't
be
angry
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
but
you
*NL*
seem
to
be
somehow
awfully
strange
yourself
.
Say
what
you
like
,
there
's
*NL*
something
wrong
with
you
,
and
now
,
too
...
not
this
very
minute
,
I
mean
,
*NL*
but
now
,
generally
...
Well
,
well
,
I
wo
n't
,
I
wo
n't
,
do
n't
scowl
!
I
am
*NL*
not
such
a
bear
,
you
know
,
as
you
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
gloomily
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
a
bear
,
perhaps
,
at
all
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
fancy
indeed
that
*NL*
you
are
a
man
of
very
good
breeding
,
or
at
least
know
how
on
occasion
to
*NL*
behave
like
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
particularly
interested
in
anyone
's
opinion
,
''
Svidrigailov
*NL*
answered
,
dryly
and
even
with
a
shade
of
haughtiness
,
``
and
therefore
why
*NL*
not
be
vulgar
at
times
when
vulgarity
is
such
a
convenient
cloak
for
our
*NL*
climate
...
and
especially
if
one
has
a
natural
propensity
that
way
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
laughing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
heard
you
have
many
friends
here
.
You
are
,
as
they
say
,
`
not
*NL*
without
connections
.
'
What
can
you
want
with
me
,
then
,
unless
you
've
*NL*
some
special
object
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
that
I
have
friends
here
,
''
Svidrigailov
admitted
,
not
*NL*
replying
to
the
chief
point
.
``
I
've
met
some
already
.
I
've
been
lounging
*NL*
about
for
the
last
three
days
,
and
I
've
seen
them
,
or
they
've
seen
me
.
*NL*
That
's
a
matter
of
course
.
I
am
well
dressed
and
reckoned
not
a
poor
*NL*
man
;
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
has
n't
affected
me
;
my
property
*NL*
consists
chiefly
of
forests
and
water
meadows
.
The
revenue
has
not
*NL*
fallen
off
;
but
...
I
am
not
going
to
see
them
,
I
was
sick
of
them
long
*NL*
ago
.
I
've
been
here
three
days
and
have
called
on
no
one
...
What
a
town
*NL*
it
is
!
How
has
it
come
into
existence
among
us
,
tell
me
that
?
A
town
of
*NL*
officials
and
students
of
all
sorts
.
Yes
,
there
's
a
great
deal
I
did
n't
*NL*
notice
when
I
was
here
eight
years
ago
,
kicking
up
my
heels
...
My
only
*NL*
hope
now
is
in
anatomy
,
by
Jove
,
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anatomy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
for
these
clubs
,
Dussauts
,
parades
,
or
progress
,
indeed
,
*NL*
maybe
--
well
,
all
that
can
go
on
without
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
again
without
*NL*
noticing
the
question
.
``
Besides
,
who
wants
to
be
a
card-sharper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
have
you
been
a
card-sharper
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
help
being
?
There
was
a
regular
set
of
us
,
men
of
the
best
*NL*
society
,
eight
years
ago
;
we
had
a
fine
time
.
And
all
men
of
breeding
,
*NL*
you
know
,
poets
,
men
of
property
.
And
indeed
as
a
rule
in
our
Russian
*NL*
society
the
best
manners
are
found
among
those
who
've
been
thrashed
,
*NL*
have
you
noticed
that
?
I
've
deteriorated
in
the
country
.
But
I
did
get
*NL*
into
prison
for
debt
,
through
a
low
Greek
who
came
from
Nezhin
.
Then
*NL*
Marfa
Petrovna
turned
up
;
she
bargained
with
him
and
bought
me
off
for
*NL*
thirty
thousand
silver
pieces
-LRB-
I
owed
seventy
thousand
-RRB-
.
We
were
united
*NL*
in
lawful
wedlock
and
she
bore
me
off
into
the
country
like
a
treasure
.
*NL*
You
know
she
was
five
years
older
than
I
.
She
was
very
fond
of
me
.
For
*NL*
seven
years
I
never
left
the
country
.
And
,
take
note
,
that
all
my
life
*NL*
she
held
a
document
over
me
,
the
IOU
for
thirty
thousand
roubles
,
so
*NL*
if
I
were
to
elect
to
be
restive
about
anything
I
should
be
trapped
at
*NL*
once
!
And
she
would
have
done
it
!
Women
find
nothing
incompatible
in
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
n't
been
for
that
,
would
you
have
given
her
the
slip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
It
was
scarcely
the
document
restrained
me
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
want
to
go
anywhere
else
.
Marfa
Petrovna
herself
invited
me
to
go
*NL*
abroad
,
seeing
I
was
bored
,
but
I
've
been
abroad
before
,
and
always
*NL*
felt
sick
there
.
For
no
reason
,
but
the
sunrise
,
the
bay
of
Naples
,
the
*NL*
sea
--
you
look
at
them
and
it
makes
you
sad

What
's
most
revolting
is
*NL*
that
one
is
really
sad
!
No
,
it
's
better
at
home
.
Here
at
least
one
*NL*
blames
others
for
everything
and
excuses
oneself

I
should
have
gone
*NL*
perhaps
on
an
expedition
to
the
North
Pole
,
because
_
j'
ai

hate
drinking

there
's
nothing
left

wine

I
have

tried
it

,
I
say
,
I
've
been
told
Berg
is
going
up
in
a
great
balloon
*NL*
next
Sunday
from
the
Yusupov
Garden
and
will
take
up
passengers
at
a

fee

up

Svidrigailov
really
seeming

deep
in

``

Raskolnikov

Svidrigailov
went
on

meditatively

managed

decently

.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Svidrigailov
muttered
*NL*
ingenuously
,
as
though
he
,
too
,
were
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
they
were
silent
.
They
stared
in
each
other
's
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
nonsense
!
''
Raskolnikov
shouted
with
vexation
.
``
What
does
she
*NL*
say
when
she
comes
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
!
Would
you
believe
it
,
she
talks
of
the
silliest
trifles
and
--
man
*NL*
is
a
strange
creature
--
it
makes
me
angry
.
The
first
time
she
came
in
-LRB-
I
*NL*
was
tired
you
know
:
the
funeral
service
,
the
funeral
ceremony
,
the
lunch
*NL*
afterwards
.
At
last
I
was
left
alone
in
my
study
.
I
lighted
a
cigar
and
*NL*
began
to
think
-RRB-
,
she
came
in
at
the
door
.
`
You
've
been
so
busy
to-day
,
*NL*
Arkady
Ivanovitch
,
you
have
forgotten
to
wind
the
dining-room
clock
,
'
*NL*
she
said
.
All
those
seven
years
I
've
wound
that
clock
every
week
,
and
if
*NL*
I
forgot
it
she
would
always
remind
me
.
The
next
day
I
set
off
on
my
way
*NL*
here
.
I
got
out
at
the
station
at
daybreak
;
I
'd
been
asleep
,
tired
out
,
*NL*
with
my
eyes
half
open
,
I
was
drinking
some
coffee
.
I
looked
up
and
*NL*
there
was
suddenly
Marfa
Petrovna
sitting
beside
me
with
a
pack
of
*NL*
cards
in
her
hands
.
`
Shall
I
tell
your
fortune
for
the
journey
,
Arkady
*NL*
Ivanovitch
?
'
She
was
a
great
hand
at
telling
fortunes
.
I
shall
never
*NL*
forgive
myself
for
not
asking
her
to
.
I
ran
away
in
a
fright
,
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
the
bell
rang
.
I
was
sitting
to-day
,
feeling
very
heavy
after
a
*NL*
miserable
dinner
from
a
cookshop
;
I
was
sitting
smoking
,
all
of
a
sudden
*NL*
Marfa
Petrovna
again
.
She
came
in
very
smart
in
a
new
green
silk
dress
*NL*
with
a
long
train
.
`
Good
day
,
Arkady
Ivanovitch
!
How
do
you
like
my
*NL*
dress
?
Aniska
ca
n't
make
like
this
.
'
-LRB-
Aniska
was
a
dressmaker
in
the
*NL*
country
,
one
of
our
former
serf
girls
who
had
been
trained
in
Moscow
,
a
*NL*
pretty
wench
.
-RRB-
She
stood
turning
round
before
me
.
I
looked
at
the
dress
,
*NL*
and
then
I
looked
carefully
,
very
carefully
,
at
her
face
.
'
I
wonder
*NL*
you
trouble
to
come
to
me
about
such
trifles
,
Marfa
Petrovna
.
'
`
Good
*NL*
gracious
,
you
wo
n't
let
one
disturb
you
about
anything
!
'
To
tease
her
*NL*
I
said
,
'
I
want
to
get
married
,
Marfa
Petrovna
.
'
`
That
's
just
like
you
,
*NL*
Arkady
Ivanovitch
;
it
does
you
very
little
credit
to
come
looking
for
a
*NL*
bride
when
you
've
hardly
buried
your
wife
.
And
if
you
could
make
a
good
*NL*
choice
,
at
least
,
but
I
know
it
wo
n't
be
for
your
happiness
or
hers
,
you
*NL*
will
only
be
a
laughing-stock
to
all
good
people
.
'
Then
she
went
out
and
*NL*
her
train
seemed
to
rustle
.
Is
n't
it
nonsense
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
you
are
telling
lies
?
''
Raskolnikov
put
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rarely
lie
,
''
answered
Svidrigailov
thoughtfully
,
apparently
not
*NL*
noticing
the
rudeness
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
the
past
,
have
you
ever
seen
ghosts
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Y-yes
,
I
have
seen
them
,
but
only
once
in
my
life
,
six
years
ago
.
I
had
*NL*
a
serf
,
Filka
;
just
after
his
burial
I
called
out
forgetting
`
Filka
,
my
*NL*
pipe
!
'
He
came
in
and
went
to
the
cupboard
where
my
pipes
were
.
I
sat
*NL*
still
and
thought
`
he
is
doing
it
out
of
revenge
,
'
because
we
had
a
*NL*
violent
quarrel
just
before
his
death
.
`
How
dare
you
come
in
with
a
hole
*NL*
in
your
elbow
?
'
I
said
.
`
Go
away
,
you
scamp
!
'
He
turned
and
went
out
,
*NL*
and
never
came
again
.
I
did
n't
tell
Marfa
Petrovna
at
the
time
.
I
wanted
*NL*
to
have
a
service
sung
for
him
,
but
I
was
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
go
to
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
am
not
well
,
without
your
telling
me
,
though
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
's
wrong
;
I
believe
I
am
five
times
as
strong
as
you
are
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
ask
you
whether
you
believe
that
ghosts
are
seen
,
but
whether
you
*NL*
believe
that
they
exist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
believe
it
!

Raskolnikov
cried
,
with
positive
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
people
generally
say
?
''
muttered
Svidrigailov
,
as
though
*NL*
speaking
to
himself
,
looking
aside
and
bowing
his
head
.
``
They
say
,
`
You
*NL*
are
ill
,
so
what
appears
to
you
is
only
unreal
fantasy
.
'
But
that
's
not
*NL*
strictly
logical
.
I
agree
that
ghosts
only
appear
to
the
sick
,
but
that
*NL*
only
proves
that
they
are
unable
to
appear
except
to
the
sick
,
not
that
*NL*
they
do
n't
exist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
sort
,
''
Raskolnikov
insisted
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
You
do
n't
think
so
?
''
Svidrigailov
went
on
,
looking
at
him
*NL*
deliberately
.
``
But
what
do
you
say
to
this
argument
-LRB-
help
me
with
*NL*
it
-RRB-
:
ghosts
are
,
as
it
were
,
shreds
and
fragments
of
other
worlds
,
the
*NL*
beginning
of
them
.
A
man
in
health
has
,
of
course
,
no
reason
to
see
*NL*
them
,
because
he
is
above
all
a
man
of
this
earth
and
is
bound
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
completeness
and
order
to
live
only
in
this
life
.
But
as
soon
*NL*
as
one
is
ill
,
as
soon
as
the
normal
earthly
order
of
the
organism
is
*NL*
broken
,
one
begins
to
realise
the
possibility
of
another
world
;
and
the
*NL*
more
seriously
ill
one
is
,
the
closer
becomes
one
's
contact
with
that
*NL*
other
world
,
so
that
as
soon
as
the
man
dies
he
steps
straight
into
that
*NL*
world
.
I
thought
of
that
long
ago
.
If
you
believe
in
a
future
life
,
you
*NL*
could
believe
in
that
,
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe

said
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
sat
lost
in
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
there
are
only
spiders
there
,

something
of
that

said
suddenly

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is

Raskolnikov

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
always
imagine
eternity
as
something
beyond
our
conception

*NL*
something
vast

vast

But
why
must
it
be
vast
?
Instead
of
all
that
,
what
*NL*
if
it
's
one
little
room
,
like
a
bath
house
in
the
country
,
black
*NL*
and
grimy
and
spiders
in
every
corner
,
and
that
's
all
eternity
is

I
*NL*
sometimes
fancy
it
like
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
you
can
imagine
nothing
juster
and
more
comforting
than
*NL*
that
?

Raskolnikov
cried
,
with
a
feeling
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Juster
?
And
how
can
we
tell

perhaps
that
is
just

do
you
know

what
I
would
certainly
have
made
it

answered
Svidrigailov
,
with
a
*NL*
vague
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
horrible
answer
sent
a
cold
chill
through
Raskolnikov
.
Svidrigailov
*NL*
raised
his
head
,
looked
at
him
,
and
suddenly
began
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only

he
cried
,
``
half
an

thing
.
Secondly
,
my
*NL*
conscience
is
perfectly
easy
;
I
make
the
offer
with
no
ulterior
motive
.
*NL*
You
may
not
believe
it
,
but
in
the
end
Avdotya
Romanovna
and
you
will
*NL*
know
.
The
point
is
,
that
I
did
actually
cause
your
sister
,
whom
I
*NL*
greatly
respect
,
some
trouble
and
unpleasantness
,
and
so
,
sincerely
*NL*
regretting
it
,
I
want
--
not
to
compensate
,
not
to
repay
her
for
the
*NL*
unpleasantness
,
but
simply
to
do
something
to
her
advantage
,
to
show
*NL*
that
I
am
not
,
after
all
,
privileged
to
do
nothing
but
harm
.
If
there
*NL*
were
a
millionth
fraction
of
self-interest
in
my
offer
,
I
should
not
*NL*
have
made
it
so
openly
;
and
I
should
not
have
offered
her
ten
thousand
*NL*
only
,
when
five
weeks
ago
I
offered
her
more
,
Besides
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
very
soon
marry
a
young
lady
,
and
that
alone
ought
to
prevent
suspicion
*NL*
of
any
design
on
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
In
conclusion
,
let
me
say
that
*NL*
in
marrying
Mr.
Luzhin
,
she
is
taking
money
just
the
same
,
only
from
*NL*
another
man
.
Do
n't
be
angry
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
think
it
over
coolly
*NL*
and
quietly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
himself
was
exceedingly
cool
and
quiet
as
he
was
saying
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
say
no
more
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
.
``
In
any
case
this
is
*NL*
unpardonable
impertinence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
.
Then
a
man
may
do
nothing
but
harm
to
his
neighbour
*NL*
in
this
world
,
and
is
prevented
from
doing
the
tiniest
bit
of
good
*NL*
by
trivial
conventional
formalities
.
That
's
absurd
.
If
I
died
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
and
left
that
sum
to
your
sister
in
my
will
,
surely
she
*NL*
would
n't
refuse
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
she
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
indeed
.
However
,
if
you
refuse
it
,
so
be
it
,
though
ten
*NL*
thousand
roubles
is
a
capital
thing
to
have
on
occasion
.
In
any
case
I
*NL*
beg
you
to
repeat
what
I
have
said
to
Avdotya
Romanovna
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
try
and
see
her
*NL*
myself
and
worry
her
by
doing
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
do
tell
her
,
will
you
not
try
to
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
really
what
to

I
should

very
much
to

once
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hope
for
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
.
But
you
do

Perhaps
we
may
become
better
*NL*
friends

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
we
may
become
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
''
Svidrigailov
said
,
smiling
.
He
stood
up
and
took
his
hat
.
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
quite
intend
to
disturb
you
and
I
came
here
without
reckoning
*NL*
on
it
...
though
I
was
very
much
struck
by
your
face
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
see
me
this
morning
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
by
chance

I
kept
fancying
there
is
something
about
you

like
me

But
do
n't
be
uneasy
.
I
am
not
intrusive
;
I
used
to
get
on
*NL*
all
right
with
card-sharpers
,
and
I
never
bored
Prince
Svirbey
,
a
great
*NL*
personage
who
is
a
distant
relation
of
mine
,
and
I
could
write
about
*NL*
Raphael
's
_
Madonna
_
in
Madam
Prilukov
's
album
,
and
I
never
left
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
's
side
for
seven
years
,

I
used
to
stay
the
night
at
*NL*
Viazemsky
's
house
in
the
Hay
Market
in
the
old
days
,
and
I
may
go
up
in

a
balloon
with
Berg

perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

all
right

Are
you

I
ask

*NL*
``
What
travels
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
on
that
`
journey

;
you
spoke
of
it
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
journey
?
Oh
,
yes

I
did
speak
of
a
journey

Well
,
that
's
a
wide
*NL*
subject
...
if
only
you
knew
what
you
are
asking
,
''
he
added
,
and
gave
*NL*
a
sudden
,
loud
,
short
laugh
.
``
Perhaps
I
'll
get
married
instead
of
the

're
making
a

*NL*
``
But
I
am
very
anxious

it

good-bye
for
the
present

something

that

remembered

her
in

left
her
three
thousand
roubles

That
's
absolutely
*NL*
certain
.
Marfa
Petrovna
arranged
it
a
week
before
her
death
,
and
it
was
*NL*
done
in
my
presence

Avdotya
Romanovna
will
be
able
to
receive
the
money
*NL*
in
two

three
weeks

As
he
went
out

Svidrigailov
ran
up
against
Razumihin
in
the
doorway

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
eight
o'clock
.
The
two
young
men
hurried
to
Bakaleyev
's
,
*NL*
to
arrive
before
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
was
that
?
''
asked
Razumihin
,
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Svidrigailov
,
that
landowner
in
whose
house
my
sister
was
*NL*
insulted
when
she
was
their
governess
.
Through
his
persecuting
her
with
*NL*
his
attentions
,
she
was
turned
out
by
his
wife
,
Marfa
Petrovna
.
This
*NL*
Marfa
Petrovna
begged
Dounia
's
forgiveness
afterwards
,
and
she
's
just
*NL*
died
suddenly
.
It
was
of
her
we
were
talking
this
morning
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
why
I
'm
afraid
of
that
man
.
He
came
here
at
once
after
his
wife
's
*NL*
funeral
.
He
is
very
strange
,
and
is
determined
on
doing
something
...
We
*NL*
must
guard
Dounia
from
him
...
that
's
what
I
wanted
to
tell
you
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guard
her
!
What
can
he
do
to
harm
Avdotya
Romanovna
?
Thank
you
,
Rodya
,
*NL*
for
speaking
to
me
like
that
...
We
will
,
we
will
guard
her
.
Where
does
*NL*
he
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
ask
?
What
a
pity
!
I
'll
find
out
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
him
?
''
asked
Raskolnikov
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
noticed
him
,
I
noticed
him
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
really
see
him
?
You
saw
him
clearly
?
''
Raskolnikov
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
him
perfectly
,
I
should
know
him
in
a
thousand
;
I
have
*NL*
a
good
memory
for
faces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
...
that
's
all
right
,
''
muttered
Raskolnikov
.
``
Do
you
know
,
I
*NL*
fancied
...
I
keep
thinking
that
it
may
have
been
an
hallucination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
all
say
,
''
Raskolnikov
went
on
,
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
*NL*
smile
,
``
that
I
am
mad
.
I
thought
just
now
that
perhaps
I
really
am
mad
,
*NL*
and
have
only
seen
a
phantom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
can
tell
?
Perhaps
I
am
really
mad
,
and
perhaps
everything
that
*NL*
happened
all
these
days
may
be
only
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
Rodya
,
you
have
been
upset
again
!
...
But
what
did
he
say
,
what
did
*NL*
he
come
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
did
not
answer
.
Razumihin
thought
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
me
tell
you
my
story
,
''
he
began
,
``
I
came
to
you
,
you
were
*NL*
asleep
.
Then
we
had
dinner
and
then
I
went
to
Porfiry
's
,
Zametov
was
*NL*
still
with
him
.
I
tried
to
begin
,
but
it
was
no
use
.
I
could
n't
speak
in
*NL*
the
right
way
.
They
do
n't
seem
to
understand
and
ca
n't
understand
,
but
*NL*
are
not
a
bit
ashamed
.
I
drew
Porfiry
to
the
window
,
and
began
talking
*NL*
to
him
,
but
it
was
still
no
use
.
He
looked
away
and
I
looked
away
.
At
*NL*
last
I
shook
my
fist
in
his
ugly
face
,
and
told
him
as
a
cousin
I
'd
*NL*
brain
him
.
He
merely
looked
at
me
,
I
cursed
and
came
away
.
That
was
*NL*
all
.
It
was
very
stupid
.
To
Zametov
I
did
n't
say
a
word
.
But
,
you
see
,
I
*NL*
thought
I
'd
made
a
mess
of
it
,
but
as
I
went
downstairs
a
brilliant
idea
*NL*
struck
me
:
why
should
we
trouble
?
Of
course
if
you
were
in
any
danger
*NL*
or
anything
,
but
why
need
you
care
?
You
need
n't
care
a
hang
for
them
.
We
*NL*
shall
have
a
laugh
at
them
afterwards
,
and
if
I
were
in
your
place
I
'd
*NL*
mystify
them
more
than
ever
.
How
ashamed
they
'll
be
afterwards
!
Hang
*NL*
them
!
We
can
thrash
them
afterwards
,
but
let
's
laugh
at
them
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
``
But
what
will
you
say
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
he
thought
to
himself
.
Strange
to
say
,
till
that
moment
it
had
never
*NL*
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
what
Razumihin
would
think
when
he
knew
.
As
he
*NL*
thought
it
,
Raskolnikov
looked
at
him
.
Razumihin
's
account
of
his
visit
*NL*
to
Porfiry
had
very
little
interest
for
him
,
so
much
had
come
and
gone
*NL*
since
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
corridor
they
came
upon
Luzhin
;
he
had
arrived
punctually
*NL*
at
eight
,
and
was
looking
for
the
number
,
so
that
all
three
went
in
*NL*
together
without
greeting
or
looking
at
one
another
.
The
young
men
*NL*
walked
in
first
,
while
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
for
good
manners
,
lingered
a
*NL*
little
in
the
passage
,
taking
off
his
coat
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
came
*NL*
forward
at
once
to
greet
him
in
the
doorway
,
Dounia
was
welcoming
her
*NL*
brother
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
walked
in
and
quite
amiably
,
though
with
*NL*
redoubled
dignity
,
bowed
to
the
ladies
.
He
looked
,
however
,
as
though
*NL*
he
were
a
little
put
out
and
could
not
yet
recover
himself
.
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
who
seemed
also
a
little
embarrassed
,
hastened
to
make
*NL*
them
all
sit
down
at
the
round
table
where
a
samovar
was
boiling
.
Dounia
*NL*
and
Luzhin
were
facing
one
another
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
.
*NL*
Razumihin
and
Raskolnikov
were
facing
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
,
Razumihin
*NL*
was
next
to
Luzhin
and
Raskolnikov
was
beside
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
's
silence
followed
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
deliberately
drew
out
a
*NL*
cambric
handkerchief
reeking
of
scent
and
blew
his
nose
with
an
air
of
*NL*
a
benevolent
man
who
felt
himself
slighted
,
and
was
firmly
resolved
to
*NL*
insist
on
an
explanation
.
In
the
passage
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
to
*NL*
keep
on
his
overcoat
and
walk
away
,
and
so
give
the
two
ladies
a
sharp
*NL*
and
emphatic
lesson
and
make
them
feel
the
gravity
of
the
position
.
*NL*
But
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
this
.
Besides
,
he
could
not
endure
*NL*
uncertainty
,
and
he
wanted
an
explanation
:
if
his
request
had
been
so
*NL*
openly
disobeyed
,
there
was
something
behind
it
,
and
in
that
case
it
was
*NL*
better
to
find
it
out
beforehand
;
it
rested
with
him
to
punish
them
and
*NL*
there
would
always
be
time
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
you
had
a
favourable
journey
,
''
he
inquired
officially
of
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
gratified
to
hear
it
.
And
Avdotya
Romanovna
is
not
over-fatigued
*NL*
either
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
young
and
strong
,
I
do
n't
get
tired
,
but
it
was
a
great
strain
for
*NL*
mother
,
''
answered
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
unavoidable
!
our
national
railways
are
of
terrible
length
.
*NL*
`
Mother
Russia
,
'
as
they
say
,
is
a
vast
country
...
In
spite
of
all
my
*NL*
desire
to
do
so
,
I
was
unable
to
meet
you
yesterday
.
But
I
trust
all
*NL*
passed
off
without
inconvenience
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
it
was
all
terribly
disheartening
,
''
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
hastened
to
declare
with
peculiar
intonation
,
``
and
if
*NL*
Dmitri
Prokofitch
had
not
been
sent
us
,
I
really
believe
by
God
Himself
,
*NL*
we
should
have
been
utterly
lost
.
Here
,
he
is
!
Dmitri
Prokofitch
*NL*
Razumihin

''
she
added
,
introducing
him
to
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
the
pleasure

yesterday
,
''
muttered
Pyotr
Petrovitch
with
a
*NL*
hostile
glance
sidelong
at
Razumihin
;
then
he
scowled
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
belonged
to
that
class
of
persons
,
on
the
surface
very
*NL*
polite
in
society
,
who
make
a
great
point
of
punctiliousness
,
but
who
,
*NL*
directly
they
are
crossed
in
anything
,
are
completely
disconcerted
,
and
*NL*
become
more
like
sacks
of
flour
than
elegant
and
lively
men
of
society
.
*NL*
Again
all
was
silent
;
Raskolnikov
was
obstinately
mute
,
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
was
unwilling
to
open
the
conversation
too
soon
.
Razumihin
had
*NL*
nothing
to
say
,
so
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
anxious
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marfa
Petrovna
is
dead
,
have
you
heard
?
''
she
began
having
recourse
to
*NL*
her
leading
item
of
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
I
heard
so
.
I
was
immediately
informed
,
and
I
have
come
to
*NL*
make
you
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
Arkady
Ivanovitch
Svidrigailov
*NL*
set
off
in
haste
for
Petersburg
immediately
after
his
wife
's
funeral
.
So
*NL*
at
least
I
have
excellent
authority
for
believing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Petersburg
?
here
?
''
Dounia
asked
in
alarm
and
looked
at
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
and
doubtless
not
without
some
design
,
having
in
view
the
*NL*
rapidity
of
his
departure
,
and
all
the
circumstances
preceding
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
wo
n't
he
leave
Dounia
in
peace
even
here
?
''
cried
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
neither
you
nor
Avdotya
Romanovna
have
any
grounds
for
*NL*
uneasiness
,
unless
,
of
course
,
you
are
yourselves
desirous
of
getting
*NL*
into
communication
with
him
.
For
my
part
I
am
on
my
guard
,
and
am
now
*NL*
discovering
where
he
is
lodging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
you
would
not
believe
what
a
fright
you
have
*NL*
given
me
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
went
on
:
``
I
've
only
seen
him
twice
,
*NL*
but
I
thought
him
terrible
,
terrible
!
I
am
convinced
that
he
was
the
*NL*
cause
of
Marfa
Petrovna
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
to
be
certain
about
that
.
I
have
precise
information
.
I
*NL*
do
not
dispute
that
he
may
have
contributed
to
accelerate
the
course
of
*NL*
events
by
the
moral
influence
,
so
to
say
,
of
the
affront
;
but
as
to
the
*NL*
general
conduct
and
moral
characteristics
of
that
personage
,
I
am
*NL*
in
agreement
with
you
.
I
do
not
know
whether
he
is
well
off
now
,
and
*NL*
precisely
what
Marfa
Petrovna
left
him
;
this
will
be
known
to
me
within
*NL*
a
very
short
period
;
but
no
doubt
here
in
Petersburg
,
if
he
has
any
*NL*
pecuniary
resources
,
he
will
relapse
at
once
into
his
old
ways
.
He
is
*NL*
the
most
depraved
,
and
abjectly
vicious
specimen
of
that
class
of
men
.
*NL*
I
have
considerable
reason
to
believe
that
Marfa
Petrovna
,
who
was
so
*NL*
unfortunate
as
to
fall
in
love
with
him
and
to
pay
his
debts
eight
years
*NL*
ago
,
was
of
service
to
him
also
in
another
way
.
Solely
by
her
exertions
*NL*
and
sacrifices
,
a
criminal
charge
,
involving
an
element
of
fantastic
*NL*
and
homicidal
brutality
for
which
he
might
well
have
been
sentenced
to
*NL*
Siberia
,
was
hushed
up
.
That
's
the
sort
of
man
he
is
,
if
you
care
to
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
Raskolnikov
listened
*NL*
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
speaking
the
truth
when
you
say
that
you
have
good
evidence
of
*NL*
this
?
''
Dounia
asked
sternly
and
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
repeat
what
I
was
told
in
secret
by
Marfa
Petrovna
.
I
must
*NL*
observe
that
from
the
legal
point
of
view
the
case
was
far
from
clear
.
*NL*
There
was
,
and
I
believe
still
is
,
living
here
a
woman
called
Resslich
,
*NL*
a
foreigner
,
who
lent
small
sums
of
money
at
interest
,
and
did
other
*NL*
commissions
,
and
with
this
woman
Svidrigailov
had
for
a
long
while
close
*NL*
and
mysterious
relations
.
She
had
a
relation
,
a
niece
I
believe
,
living
*NL*
with
her
,
a
deaf
and
dumb
girl
of
fifteen
,
or
perhaps
not
more
than
*NL*
fourteen
.
Resslich
hated
this
girl
,
and
grudged
her
every
crust
;
she
*NL*
used
to
beat
her
mercilessly
.
One
day
the
girl
was
found
hanging
in
*NL*
the
garret
.
At
the
inquest
the
verdict
was
suicide
.
After
the
usual
*NL*
proceedings
the
matter
ended
,
but
,
later
on
,
information
was
given
that
*NL*
the
child
had
been
...
cruelly
outraged
by
Svidrigailov
.
It
is
true
,
this
*NL*
was
not
clearly
established
,
the
information
was
given
by
another
German
*NL*
woman
of
loose
character
whose
word
could
not
be
trusted
;
no
statement
*NL*
was
actually
made
to
the
police
,
thanks
to
Marfa
Petrovna
's
money
and
*NL*
exertions
;
it
did
not
get
beyond
gossip
.
And
yet
the
story
is
a
very
*NL*
significant
one
.
You
heard
,
no
doubt
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
when
you
were
*NL*
with
them
the
story
of
the
servant
Philip
who
died
of
ill
treatment
he
*NL*
received
six
years
ago
,
before
the
abolition
of
serfdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
this
Philip
hanged
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
but
what
drove
him
,
or
rather
perhaps
disposed
him
,
*NL*
to
suicide
was
the
systematic
persecution
and
severity
of
Mr.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
,
''
answered
Dounia
,
dryly
.
``
I
only
heard
a
queer
story
*NL*
that
Philip
was
a
sort
of
hypochondriac
,
a
sort
of
domestic
philosopher
,
*NL*
the
servants
used
to
say
,
`
he
read
himself
silly
,
'
and
that
he
hanged
*NL*
himself
partly
on
account
of
Mr.
Svidrigailov
's
mockery
of
him
and
not
*NL*
his
blows
.
When
I
was
there
he
behaved
well
to
the
servants
,
and
they
*NL*
were
actually
fond
of
him
,
though
they
certainly
did
blame
him
for
*NL*
Philip
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
perceive
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
that
you
seem
disposed
to
undertake
his
*NL*
defence
all
of
a
sudden
,
''
Luzhin
observed
,
twisting
his
lips
into
*NL*
an
ambiguous
smile
,
``
there
's
no
doubt
that
he
is
an
astute
man
,
and
*NL*
insinuating
where
ladies
are
concerned
,
of
which
Marfa
Petrovna
,
who
has
*NL*
died
so
strangely
,
is
a
terrible
instance
.
My
only
desire
has
been
to
be
*NL*
of
service
to
you
and
your
mother
with
my
advice
,
in
view
of
the
renewed
*NL*
efforts
which
may
certainly
be
anticipated
from
him
.
For
my
part
it
's
*NL*
my
firm
conviction
,
that
he
will
end
in
a
debtor
's
prison
again
.
*NL*
Marfa
Petrovna
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
settling
anything
*NL*
substantial
on
him
,
having
regard
for
his
children
's
interests
,
and
,
*NL*
if
she
left
him
anything
,
it
would
only
be
the
merest
sufficiency
,
*NL*
something
insignificant
and
ephemeral
,
which
would
not
last
a
year
for
a
*NL*
man
of
his
habits
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
I
beg
you

''
said
Dounia
,
``
say
no
more
of
Mr.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
.
It
makes
me
miserable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
just
been
to
see
me

''
said
Raskolnikov
,
breaking
his
silence
for
*NL*
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
exclamations
from
all
,
and
they
all
turned
to
him
.
Even
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
was
roused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
hour
and
a
half
ago
,
he
came
in
when
I
was
asleep
,
waked
me
,
and
*NL*
introduced
himself
,
''
Raskolnikov
continued
.
``
He
was
fairly
cheerful
*NL*
and
at
ease
,
and
quite
hopes
that
we
shall
become
friends
.
He
is
*NL*
particularly
anxious
,
by
the
way
,
Dounia
,
for
an
interview
with
you
,
at
*NL*
which
he
asked
me
to
assist
.
He
has
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
,
and
*NL*
he
told
me
about
it
.
He
told
me
,
too
,
that
a
week
before
her
death
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
left
you
three
thousand
roubles
in
her
will

Dounia

that

you
can
receive
the
money
very
shortly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

cried
Pulcheria

,
crossing
herself
.
``

broke
from
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us

more

Dounia
urged
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
said
that

was
left

now

Raskolnikov
ceased

turned
his
attention
to
his
tea

*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
looked
at
his
watch

``

am
compelled

keep

he
added
with
an
air
of
some
pique
and
he
began
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go

Dounia
,
``
you
intended

explanation
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so

Avdotya

Pyotr

answered

impressively
,
sitting
down
again
,
but
still
holding
his
hat

``
I

certainly
desired
an
explanation

as
your

not

proposals

more
irritated

on

impertinent

you
admit
the

*NL*
``
What

cried
Dounia
,
flushing
.
``
I
set
your

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
smiled
sarcastically
,
Razumihin
fidgeted
,
but
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
did
not
accept
the
reproof
;
on
the
contrary
,
at
every
word
he
*NL*
became
more
persistent

irritable

relished
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
pronounced
sententiously

he
bowed
politely

that

characteristic

pale
with
anger

with
the
effort

restraining
it

*NL*
could
not
help
breaking
into
laughter

furious

going
close
up

quietly

distinctly

Pyotr

gazed
at

for
some
seconds
with
a
pale
face
that

worked
with
anger

then
he
turned

went
out

and
rarely
has
any
man
*NL*
carried
away
in
his
heart
such
vindictive
hatred
as
he
felt
against
*NL*
Raskolnikov

Him
,
and
him
alone

he
blamed
for
everything

It
is
*NL*
noteworthy
that
as
he
went
downstairs
he
still
imagined
that
his
case
*NL*
was
perhaps
not
utterly
lost
,
and
that
,
so
far
as
the
ladies
were
*NL*
concerned

all

``
very
well

be
set
right
again

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
up
to
the
last
moment
he
had
never
expected
such
an
*NL*
ending
;
he
had
been
overbearing
to
the
last
degree
,
never
dreaming
that
*NL*
two
destitute
and
defenceless
women
could
escape
from
his
control
.
This
*NL*
conviction
was
strengthened
by
his
vanity
and
conceit
,
a
conceit
to
*NL*
the
point
of
fatuity
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
who
had
made
his
way
up
from
*NL*
insignificance
,
was
morbidly
given
to
self-admiration
,
had
the
highest
*NL*
opinion
of
his
intelligence
and
capacities
,
and
sometimes
even
gloated
*NL*
in
solitude
over
his
image
in
the
glass
.
But
what
he
loved
and
valued
*NL*
above
all
was
the
money
he
had
amassed
by
his
labour
,
and
by
all
sorts
*NL*
of
devices
:
that
money
made
him
the
equal
of
all
who
had
been
his
*NL*
superiors
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
bitterly
reminded
Dounia
that
he
had
decided
to
take
her
in
*NL*
spite
of
evil
report
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
spoken
with
perfect
sincerity
*NL*
and
had
,
indeed
,
felt
genuinely
indignant
at
such
``
black
ingratitude
.
''
*NL*
And
yet
,
when
he
made
Dounia
his
offer
,
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
*NL*
groundlessness
of
all
the
gossip
.
The
story
had
been
everywhere
*NL*
contradicted
by
Marfa
Petrovna
,
and
was
by
then
disbelieved
by
all
the
*NL*
townspeople
,
who
were
warm
in
Dounia'a
defence
.
And
he
would
not
have
*NL*
denied
that
he
knew
all
that
at
the
time
.
Yet
he
still
thought
highly
*NL*
of
his
own
resolution
in
lifting
Dounia
to
his
level
and
regarded
it
as
*NL*
something
heroic
.
In
speaking
of
it
to
Dounia
,
he
had
let
out
the
secret
*NL*
feeling
he
cherished
and
admired
,
and
he
could
not
understand
that
*NL*
others
should
fail
to
admire
it
too
.
He
had
called
on
Raskolnikov
with
*NL*
the
feelings
of
a
benefactor
who
is
about
to
reap
the
fruits
of
his
good
*NL*
deeds
and
to
hear
agreeable
flattery
.
And
as
he
went
downstairs
now
,
he
*NL*
considered
himself
most
undeservedly
injured
and
unrecognised
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
was
simply
essential
to
him
;
to
do
without
her
was
unthinkable
.
*NL*
For
many
years
he
had
had
voluptuous
dreams
of
marriage
,
but
he
had
*NL*
gone
on
waiting
and
amassing
money
.
He
brooded
with
relish
,
in
profound
*NL*
secret
,
over
the
image
of
a
girl
--
virtuous
,
poor
-LRB-
she
must
be
poor
-RRB-
,
*NL*
very
young
,
very
pretty
,
of
good
birth
and
education
,
very
timid
,
one
*NL*
who
had
suffered
much
,
and
was
completely
humbled
before
him
,
one
who
*NL*
would
all
her
life
look
on
him
as
her
saviour
,
worship
him
,
admire
him
*NL*
and
only
him
.
How
many
scenes
,
how
many
amorous
episodes
he
had
imagined
*NL*
on
this
seductive
and
playful
theme
,
when
his
work
was
over
!
And
,
*NL*
behold
,
the
dream
of
so
many
years
was
all
but
realised
;
the
beauty
and
*NL*
education
of
Avdotya
Romanovna
had
impressed
him
;
her
helpless
position
*NL*
had
been
a
great
allurement
;
in
her
he
had
found
even
more
than
he
*NL*
dreamed
of
.
Here
was
a
girl
of
pride
,
character
,
virtue
,
of
education
*NL*
and
breeding
superior
to
his
own
-LRB-
he
felt
that
-RRB-
,
and
this
creature
would
*NL*
be
slavishly
grateful
all
her
life
for
his
heroic
condescension
,
and
*NL*
would
humble
herself
in
the
dust
before
him
,
and
he
would
have
absolute
,
*NL*
unbounded
power
over
her
!
...
Not
long
before
,
he
had
,
too
,
after
long
*NL*
reflection
and
hesitation
,
made
an
important
change
in
his
career
and
*NL*
was
now
entering
on
a
wider
circle
of
business
.
With
this
change
his
*NL*
cherished
dreams
of
rising
into
a
higher
class
of
society
seemed
likely
*NL*
to
be
realised
...
He
was
,
in
fact
,
determined
to
try
his
fortune
*NL*
in
Petersburg
.
He
knew
that
women
could
do
a
very
great
deal
.
The
*NL*
fascination
of
a
charming
,
virtuous
,
highly
educated
woman
might
make
*NL*
his
way
easier
,
might
do
wonders
in
attracting
people
to
him
,
throwing
*NL*
an
aureole
round
him
,
and
now
everything
was
in
ruins
!
This
sudden
*NL*
horrible
rupture
affected
him
like
a
clap
of
thunder
;
it
was
like
a
*NL*
hideous
joke
,
an
absurdity
.
He
had
only
been
a
tiny
bit
masterful
,
*NL*
had
not
even
time
to
speak
out
,
had
simply
made
a
joke
,
been
carried
*NL*
away
--
and
it
had
ended
so
seriously
.
And
,
of
course
,
too
,
he
did
love
*NL*
Dounia
in
his
own
way
;
he
already
possessed
her
in
his
dreams
--
and
all
*NL*
at
once
!
No
!
The
next
day
,
the
very
next
day
,
it
must
all
be
set
right
,
*NL*
smoothed
over
,
settled
.
Above
all
he
must
crush
that
conceited
milksop
*NL*
who
was
the
cause
of
it
all
.
With
a
sick
feeling
he
could
not
help
*NL*
recalling
Razumihin
too
,
but
,
he
soon
reassured
himself
on
that
score
;
*NL*
as
though
a
fellow
like
that
could
be
put
on
a
level
with
him
!
The
man
*NL*
he
really
dreaded
in
earnest
was
Svidrigailov
...
He
had
,
in
short
,
a
*NL*
great
deal
to
attend
to
...
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
,
I
am
more
to
blame
than
anyone
!
''
said
Dounia
,
kissing
and
*NL*
embracing
her
mother
.
``
I
was
tempted
by
his
money
,
but
on
my
honour
,
*NL*
brother
,
I
had
no
idea
he
was
such
a
base
man
.
If
I
had
seen
through
him
*NL*
before
,
nothing
would
have
tempted
me
!
Do
n't
blame
me
,
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
has
delivered
us
!
God
has
delivered
us
!
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
*NL*
muttered
,
but
half
consciously
,
as
though
scarcely
able
to
realise
what
*NL*
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
relieved
,
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
laughing
.
Only
now
*NL*
and
then
Dounia
turned
white
and
frowned
,
remembering
what
had
passed
.
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
,
too
,
was
glad
:
*NL*
she
had
only
that
morning
thought
rupture
with
Luzhin
a
terrible
*NL*
misfortune
.
Razumihin
was
delighted
.
He
did
not
yet
dare
to
express
his
*NL*
joy
fully
,
but
he
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
as
though
a
ton-weight
*NL*
had
fallen
off
his
heart
.
Now
he
had
the
right
to
devote
his
life
to
*NL*
them
,
to
serve
them
...
Anything
might
happen
now
!
But
he
felt
afraid
to
*NL*
think
of
further
possibilities
and
dared
not
let
his
imagination
*NL*
range
.
But
Raskolnikov
sat
still
in
the
same
place
,
almost
sullen
and
*NL*
indifferent
.
Though
he
had
been
the
most
insistent
on
getting
rid
of
*NL*
Luzhin
,
he
seemed
now
the
least
concerned
at
what
had
happened
.
Dounia
*NL*
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
still
angry
with
her
,
and
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
watched
him
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
Svidrigailov
say
to
you
?
''
said
Dounia
,
approaching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
raised
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
to
make
you
a
present
of
ten
thousand
roubles
and
he
desires
*NL*
to
see
you
once
in
my
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
her
!
On
no
account
!
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
``
And
how
dare
he
*NL*
offer
her
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Raskolnikov
repeated
-LRB-
rather
dryly
-RRB-
his
conversation
with
*NL*
Svidrigailov
,
omitting
his
account
of
the
ghostly
visitations
of
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
,
wishing
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
answer
did
you
give
him
?
''
asked
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
first
I
said
I
would
not
take
any
message
to
you
.
Then
he
said
that
*NL*
he
would
do
his
utmost
to
obtain
an
interview
with
you
without
my
help
.
*NL*
He
assured
me
that
his
passion
for
you
was
a
passing
infatuation
,
now
he
*NL*
has
no
feeling
for
you
.
He
does
n't
want
you
to
marry
Luzhin
...
His
talk
*NL*
was
altogether
rather
muddled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
explain
him
to
yourself
,
Rodya
?
How
did
he
strike
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
I
do
n't
quite
understand
him
.
He
offers
you
ten
*NL*
thousand
,
and
yet
says
he
is
not
well
off
.
He
says
he
is
going
away
,
and
*NL*
in
ten
minutes
he
forgets
he
has
said
it
.
Then
he
says
he
is
going
to
be
*NL*
married
and
has
already
fixed
on
the
girl
...
No
doubt
he
has
a
motive
,
*NL*
and
probably
a
bad
one
.
But
it
's
odd
that
he
should
be
so
clumsy
about
*NL*
it
if
he
had
any
designs
against
you
...
Of
course
,
I
refused
this
*NL*
money
on
your
account
,
once
for
all
.
Altogether
,
I
thought
him
very
*NL*
strange
...
One
might
almost
think
he
was
mad
.
But
I
may
be
mistaken
;
*NL*
that
may
only
be
the
part
he
assumes
.
The
death
of
Marfa
Petrovna
seems
*NL*
to
have
made
a
great
impression
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
rest
her
soul
,
''
exclaimed
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
``
I
shall
always
,
*NL*
always
pray
for
her
!
Where
should
we
be
now
,
Dounia
,
without
this
three
*NL*
thousand
!
It
's
as
though
it
had
fallen
from
heaven
!
Why
,
Rodya
,
this
*NL*
morning
we
had
only
three
roubles
in
our
pocket
and
Dounia
and
I
were
*NL*
just
planning
to
pawn
her
watch
,
so
as
to
avoid
borrowing
from
that
man
*NL*
until
he
offered
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
seemed
strangely
impressed
by
Svidrigailov
's
offer
.
She
still
*NL*
stood
meditating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
got
some
terrible
plan
,
''
she
said
in
a
half
whisper
to
herself
,
*NL*
almost
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
noticed
this
disproportionate
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
I
shall
have
to
see
him
more
than
once
again
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
watch
him
!
I
will
track
him
out
!
''
cried
Razumihin
,
vigorously
.
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
lose
sight
of
him
.
Rodya
has
given
me
leave
.
He
said
to
me
*NL*
himself
just
now
.
`
Take
care
of
my
sister
.
'
Will
you
give
me
leave
,
too
,
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
,
but
the
look
of
anxiety
did
not
*NL*
leave
her
face
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
gazed
at
her
timidly
,
but
the
*NL*
three
thousand
roubles
had
obviously
a
soothing
effect
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
they
were
all
engaged
in
a
lively
*NL*
conversation
.
Even
Raskolnikov
listened
attentively
for
some
time
,
*NL*
though
he
did
not
talk
.
Razumihin
was
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
,
why
should
you
go
away
?
''
he
flowed
on
ecstatically
.
``
And
what
*NL*
are
you
to
do
in
a
little
town
?
The
great
thing
is
,
you
are
all
here
*NL*
together
and
you
need
one
another
--
you
do
need
one
another
,
believe
me
.
*NL*
For
a
time
,
anyway
...
Take
me
into
partnership
,
and
I
assure
you
we
'll
*NL*
plan
a
capital
enterprise
.
Listen
!
I
'll
explain
it
all
in
detail
to
*NL*
you
,
the
whole
project
!
It
all
flashed
into
my
head
this
morning
,
*NL*
before
anything
had
happened
...
I
tell
you
what
;
I
have
an
uncle
,
I
must
*NL*
introduce
him
to
you
-LRB-
a
most
accommodating
and
respectable
old
man
-RRB-
.
*NL*
This
uncle
has
got
a
capital
of
a
thousand
roubles
,
and
he
lives
on
his
*NL*
pension
and
has
no
need
of
that
money
.
For
the
last
two
years
he
has
*NL*
been
bothering
me
to
borrow
it
from
him
and
pay
him
six
per
cent
.
*NL*
interest
.
I
know
what
that
means
;
he
simply
wants
to
help
me
.
Last
year
*NL*
I
had
no
need
of
it
,
but
this
year
I
resolved
to
borrow
it
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
arrived
.
Then
you
lend
me
another
thousand
of
your
three
and
we
have
*NL*
enough
for
a
start
,
so
we
'll
go
into
partnership
,
and
what
are
we
going
*NL*
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Razumihin
began
to
unfold
his
project
,
and
he
explained
at
length
*NL*
that
almost
all
our
publishers
and
booksellers
know
nothing
at
all
*NL*
of
what
they
are
selling
,
and
for
that
reason
they
are
usually
bad
*NL*
publishers
,
and
that
any
decent
publications
pay
as
a
rule
and
give
*NL*
a
profit
,
sometimes
a
considerable
one
.
Razumihin
had
,
indeed
,
been
*NL*
dreaming
of
setting
up
as
a
publisher
.
For
the
last
two
years
he
had
*NL*
been
working
in
publishers
'
offices
,
and
knew
three
European
languages
*NL*
well
,
though
he
had
told
Raskolnikov
six
days
before
that
he
was
*NL*
``
schwach
''
in
German
with
an
object
of
persuading
him
to
take
half
his
*NL*
translation
and
half
the
payment
for
it
.
He
had
told
a
lie
then
,
and
*NL*
Raskolnikov
knew
he
was
lying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
why
should
we
let
our
chance
slip
when
we
have
one
of
the
chief
*NL*
means
of
success
--
money
of
our
own
!
''
cried
Razumihin
warmly
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
there
will
be
a
lot
of
work
,
but
we
will
work
,
you
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
*NL*
I
,
Rodion
...
You
get
a
splendid
profit
on
some
books
nowadays
!
And
*NL*
the
great
point
of
the
business
is
that
we
shall
know
just
what
wants
*NL*
translating
,
and
we
shall
be
translating
,
publishing
,
learning
all
at
*NL*
once
.
I
can
be
of
use
because
I
have
experience
.
For
nearly
two
years
*NL*
I
've
been
scuttling
about
among
the
publishers
,
and
now
I
know
every
*NL*
detail
of
their
business
.
You
need
not
be
a
saint
to
make
pots
,
believe
*NL*
me
!
And
why
,
why
should
we
let
our
chance
slip
!
Why
,
I
know
--
and
I
kept
*NL*
the
secret
--
two
or
three
books
which
one
might
get
a
hundred
roubles
*NL*
simply
for
thinking
of
translating
and
publishing
.
Indeed
,
and
I
would
*NL*
not
take
five
hundred
for
the
very
idea
of
one
of
them
.
And
what
do
you
*NL*
think
?
If
I
were
to
tell
a
publisher
,
I
dare
say
he
'd
hesitate
--
they
are
*NL*
such
blockheads
!
And
as
for
the
business
side
,
printing
,
paper
,
selling
,
*NL*
you
trust
to
me
,
I
know
my
way
about
.
We
'll
begin
in
a
small
way
and
go
*NL*
on
to
a
large
.
In
any
case
it
will
get
us
our
living
and
we
shall
get
*NL*
back
our
capital
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
's
eyes
shone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
what
you
are
saying
,
Dmitri
Prokofitch

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

put
in
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna

*NL*
``
it
may
be

It

remain
here

She
looked
at
Rodya

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

''
said
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

he
answered
.
``
Of
course
,
it
's
too
*NL*
soon
to
dream
of
a
publishing
firm
,
but
we
certainly
might
bring
out
*NL*
five
or
six
books
and
be
sure
of
success
.
I
know
of
one
book
myself
*NL*
which
would
be
sure
to
go
well
.
And
as
for
his
being
able
to
manage
it
,
*NL*
there
's
no
doubt
about
that
either
.
He
knows
the
business
...
But
we
can
*NL*
talk
it
over
later
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
cried
Razumihin
.
``
Now
,
stay
,
there
's
a
flat
here
in
this
*NL*
house
,
belonging
to
the
same
owner
.
It
's
a
special
flat
apart
,
not
*NL*
communicating
with
these
lodgings
.
It
's
furnished
,
rent
moderate
,
*NL*
three
rooms
.
Suppose
you
take
them
to
begin
with
.
I
'll
pawn
your
watch
*NL*
to-morrow
and
bring
you
the
money
,
and
everything
can
be
arranged
then
.
*NL*
You
can
all
three
live
together
,
and
Rodya
will
be
with
you
.
But
where
*NL*
are
you
off
to
,
Rodya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Rodya
,
you
are
going
already
?
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
asked
in
*NL*
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
such
a
minute
?
''
cried
Razumihin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
looked
at
her
brother
with
incredulous
wonder
.
He
held
his
cap
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
he
was
preparing
to
leave
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
think
you
were
burying
me
or
saying
good-bye
for
ever
,
''
he
*NL*
said
somewhat
oddly
.
He
attempted
to
smile
,
but
it
did
not
turn
out
a
*NL*
smile
.
``
But
who
knows
,
perhaps
it
is
the
last
time
we
shall
see
each
*NL*
other
...
''
he
let
slip
accidentally
.
It
was
what
he
was
thinking
,
and
it
*NL*
somehow
was
uttered
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
cried
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
,
Rodya
?
''
asked
Dounia
rather
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
quite
obliged
to
...
''
he
answered
vaguely
,
as
though
hesitating
*NL*
what
he
would
say
.
But
there
was
a
look
of
sharp
determination
in
his
*NL*
white
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
say
...
as
I
was
coming
here
...
I
meant
to
tell
you
,
mother
,
*NL*
and
you
,
Dounia
,
that
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
part
for
a
time
.
I
*NL*
feel
ill
,
I
am
not
at
peace
...
I
will
come
afterwards
,
I
will
come
of
*NL*
myself
...
when
it
's
possible
.
I
remember
you
and
love
you
...
Leave
me
,
*NL*
leave
me
alone
.
I
decided
this
even
before
...
I
'm
absolutely
resolved
on
*NL*
it
.
Whatever
may
come
to
me
,
whether
I
come
to
ruin
or
not
,
I
want
to
be
*NL*
alone

Forget
me
altogether

it
's
better

Do
n't
inquire
about
me

When

I
can

I
'll
come
of
myself

I
'll
send
for
you

Perhaps
it
will
all
*NL*
come
back
,
but
now
if
you
love
me

give
me
up

else
I
shall
begin
to
*NL*
hate
you
,
I
feel
it

Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
.
Both
his
mother
and
his
sister
*NL*
were
terribly
alarmed
.
Razumihin
was
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodya
,
Rodya
,
be
reconciled
with
us
!
Let
us
be
as
before
!
''
cried
his
*NL*
poor
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
slowly
to
the
door
and
slowly
went
out
of
the
room
.
Dounia
*NL*
overtook
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
what
are
you
doing
to
mother
?
''
she
whispered
,
her
eyes
*NL*
flashing
with
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
dully
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
I
shall
come
...
I
'm
coming
,
''
he
muttered
in
an
undertone
,
*NL*
as
though
not
fully
conscious
of
what
he
was
saying
,
and
he
went
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wicked
,
heartless
egoist
!
''
cried
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
insane
,
but
not
heartless
.
He
is
mad
!
Do
n't
you
see
it
?
You
're
*NL*
heartless
after
that
!
''
Razumihin
whispered
in
her
ear
,
squeezing
*NL*
her
hand
tightly
.
``
I
shall
be
back
directly
,
''
he
shouted
to
the
*NL*
horror-stricken
mother
,
and
he
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
run
after
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
Go
back
to
them
--
be
with
*NL*
them
...
be
with
them
to-morrow
and
always
...
I.
.
.
perhaps
I
shall
*NL*
come
...
if
I
can
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
holding
out
his
hand
he
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
you
going
?
What
are
you
doing
?
What
's
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
?
How
can
you
go
on
like
this
?
''
Razumihin
muttered
,
at
his
wits
'
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
stopped
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
for
all
,
never
ask
me
about
anything
.
I
have
nothing
to
tell
you
.
*NL*
Do
n't
come
to
see
me
.
Maybe
I
'll
come
here
...
Leave
me
,
but
_
do
n't
*NL*
leave
_
them
.
Do
you
understand
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dark
in
the
corridor
,
they
were
standing
near
the
lamp
.
For
a
*NL*
minute
they
were
looking
at
one
another
in
silence
.
Razumihin
remembered
*NL*
that
minute
all
his
life
.
Raskolnikov
's
burning
and
intent
eyes
*NL*
grew
more
penetrating
every
moment
,
piercing
into
his
soul
,
into
his
*NL*
consciousness
.
Suddenly
Razumihin
started
.
Something
strange
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
passed
between
them
...
Some
idea
,
some
hint
,
as
it
were
,
slipped
,
*NL*
something
awful
,
hideous
,
and
suddenly
understood
on
both
sides
...
*NL*
Razumihin
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
now
?
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
his
face
twitching
nervously
.
*NL*
``
Go
back
,
go
to
them
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
and
turning
quickly
,
he
went
*NL*
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
attempt
to
describe
how
Razumihin
went
back
to
the
ladies
,
*NL*
how
he
soothed
them
,
how
he
protested
that
Rodya
needed
rest
in
his
*NL*
illness
,
protested
that
Rodya
was
sure
to
come
,
that
he
would
come
every
*NL*
day
,
that
he
was
very
,
very
much
upset
,
that
he
must
not
be
irritated
,
*NL*
that
he
,
Razumihin
,
would
watch
over
him
,
would
get
him
a
doctor
,
the
*NL*
best
doctor
,
a
consultation
...
In
fact
from
that
evening
Razumihin
took
*NL*
his
place
with
them
as
a
son
and
a
brother
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
straight
to
the
house
on
the
canal
bank
where
Sonia
*NL*
lived
.
It
was
an
old
green
house
of
three
storeys
.
He
found
the
*NL*
porter
and
obtained
from
him
vague
directions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
*NL*
Kapernaumov
,
the
tailor
.
Having
found
in
the
corner
of
the
courtyard
*NL*
the
entrance
to
the
dark
and
narrow
staircase
,
he
mounted
to
the
second
*NL*
floor
and
came
out
into
a
gallery
that
ran
round
the
whole
second
storey
*NL*
over
the
yard
.
While
he
was
wandering
in
the
darkness
,
uncertain
where
*NL*
to
turn
for
Kapernaumov
's
door
,
a
door
opened
three
paces
from
him
;
he
*NL*
mechanically
took
hold
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
?
''
a
woman
's
voice
asked
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
I.
.
.
come
to
see
you
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
and
he
walked
into
the
*NL*
tiny
entry
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
broken
chair
stood
a
candle
in
a
battered
copper
candlestick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
you
!
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Sonia
weakly
,
and
she
stood
rooted
to
*NL*
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
your
room
?
This
way
?
''
and
Raskolnikov
,
trying
not
to
look
at
*NL*
her
,
hastened
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
Sonia
,
too
,
came
in
with
the
candle
,
set
down
the
*NL*
candlestick
and
,
completely
disconcerted
,
stood
before
him
inexpressibly
*NL*
agitated
and
apparently
frightened
by
his
unexpected
visit
.
The
colour
*NL*
rushed
suddenly
to
her
pale
face
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
...
She
*NL*
felt
sick
and
ashamed
and
happy
,
too
...
Raskolnikov
turned
away
quickly
*NL*
and
sat
on
a
chair
by
the
table
.
He
scanned
the
room
in
a
rapid
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
large
but
exceedingly
low-pitched
room
,
the
only
one
let
by
the
*NL*
Kapernaumovs
,
to
whose
rooms
a
closed
door
led
in
the
wall
on
the
left
.
*NL*
In
the
opposite
side
on
the
right
hand
wall
was
another
door
,
always
*NL*
kept
locked
.
That
led
to
the
next
flat
,
which
formed
a
separate
lodging
.
*NL*
Sonia
's
room
looked
like
a
barn
;
it
was
a
very
irregular
quadrangle
and
*NL*
this
gave
it
a
grotesque
appearance
.
A
wall
with
three
windows
looking
*NL*
out
on
to
the
canal
ran
aslant
so
that
one
corner
formed
a
very
acute
*NL*
angle
,
and
it
was
difficult
to
see
in
it
without
very
strong
light
.
*NL*
The
other
corner
was
disproportionately
obtuse
.
There
was
scarcely
any
*NL*
furniture
in
the
big
room
:
in
the
corner
on
the
right
was
a
bedstead
,
*NL*
beside
it
,
nearest
the
door
,
a
chair
.
A
plain
,
deal
table
covered
by
a
*NL*
blue
cloth
stood
against
the
same
wall
,
close
to
the
door
into
the
other
*NL*
flat
.
Two
rush-bottom
chairs
stood
by
the
table
.
On
the
opposite
*NL*
wall
near
the
acute
angle
stood
a
small
plain
wooden
chest
of
drawers
*NL*
looking
,
as
it
were
,
lost
in
a
desert
.
That
was
all
there
was
in
the
*NL*
room
.
The
yellow
,
scratched
and
shabby
wall-paper
was
black
in
the
*NL*
corners
.
It
must
have
been
damp
and
full
of
fumes
in
the
winter
.
There
*NL*
was
every
sign
of
poverty
;
even
the
bedstead
had
no
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
in
silence
at
her
visitor
,
who
was
so
attentively
and
*NL*
unceremoniously
scrutinising
her
room
,
and
even
began
at
last
to
tremble
*NL*
with
terror
,
as
though
she
was
standing
before
her
judge
and
the
arbiter
*NL*
of
her
destinies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
late
...
It
's
eleven
,
is
n't
it
?
''
he
asked
,
still
not
lifting
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
muttered
Sonia
,
``
oh
yes
,
it
is
,
''
she
added
,
hastily
,
as
though
in
*NL*
that
lay
her
means
of
escape
.
``
My
landlady
's
clock
has
just
struck
...
I
*NL*
heard
it
myself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
you
for
the
last
time
,
''
Raskolnikov
went
on
gloomily
,
*NL*
although
this
was
the
first
time
.
``
I
may
perhaps
not
see
you
again
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
...
going
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
...
to-morrow
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
not
coming
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
to-morrow
?
''
Sonia
's
voice
*NL*
shook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
shall
know
to-morrow
morning
...
Never
mind
that
:
I
've
*NL*
come
to
say
one
word
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
brooding
eyes
to
her
and
suddenly
noticed
that
he
was
*NL*
sitting
down
while
she
was
all
the
while
standing
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
standing
?
Sit
down
,
''
he
said
in
a
changed
voice
,
gentle
and
*NL*
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
.
He
looked
kindly
and
almost
compassionately
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
thin
you
are
!
What
a
hand
!
Quite
transparent
,
like
a
dead
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
.
Sonia
smiled
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
always
been
like
that
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
when
you
lived
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
were
,
''
he
added
abruptly
and
the
expression
of
his
face
*NL*
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
changed
again
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
him
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
rent
this
room
from
the
Kapernaumovs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
live
there
,
through
that
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
They
have
another
room
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
in
one
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
afraid
in
your
room
at
night
,
''
he
observed
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
good
people
,
very
kind
,
''
answered
Sonia
,
who
still
seemed
*NL*
bewildered
,
``
and
all
the
furniture
,
everything
...
everything
is
theirs
.
*NL*
And
they
are
very
kind
and
the
children
,
too
,
often
come
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
all
stammer
,
do
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
He
stammers
and
he
's
lame
.
And
his
wife
,
too
...
It
's
not
*NL*
exactly
that
she
stammers
,
but
she
ca
n't
speak
plainly
.
She
is
a
very
*NL*
kind
woman
.
And
he
used
to
be
a
house
serf
.
And
there
are
seven
*NL*
children
...
and
it
's
only
the
eldest
one
that
stammers
and
the
others
*NL*
are
simply
ill
...
but
they
do
n't
stammer
...
But
where
did
you
hear
*NL*
about
them
?
''
she
added
with
some
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
told
me
,
then
.
He
told
me
all
about
you
...
And
how
you
*NL*
went
out
at
six
o'clock
and
came
back
at
nine
and
how
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
knelt
down
by
your
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
was
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancied
I
saw
him
to-day
,
''
she
whispered
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
.
I
was
walking
in
the
street
,
out
there
at
the
corner
,
about
ten
*NL*
o'clock
and
he
seemed
to
be
walking
in
front
.
It
looked
just
like
him
.
I
*NL*
wanted
to
go
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
walking
in
the
streets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Sonia
whispered
abruptly
,
again
overcome
with
confusion
and
*NL*
looking
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
used
to
beat
you
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
what
are
you
saying
?
No
!
''
Sonia
looked
at
him
almost
with
*NL*
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
her
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
her
?
Of
course
!
''
said
Sonia
with
plaintive
emphasis
,
and
she
*NL*
clasped
her
hands
in
distress
.
``
Ah
,
you
do
n't
...
If
you
only
knew
!
*NL*
You
see
,
she
is
quite
like
a
child
...
Her
mind
is
quite
unhinged
,
you
*NL*
see
...
from
sorrow
.
And
how
clever
she
used
to
be
...
how
generous
...
how
*NL*
kind
!
Ah
,
you
do
n't
understand
,
you
do
n't
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
said
this
as
though
in
despair
,
wringing
her
hands
in
excitement
*NL*
and
distress
.
Her
pale
cheeks
flushed
,
there
was
a
look
of
anguish
in
*NL*
her
eyes
.
It
was
clear
that
she
was
stirred
to
the
very
depths
,
that
*NL*
she
was
longing
to
speak
,
to
champion
,
to
express
something
.
A
sort
*NL*
of
_
insatiable
_
compassion
,
if
one
may
so
express
it
,
was
reflected
in
*NL*
every
feature
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
me
!
how
can
you
?
Good
heavens
,
beat
me
!
And
if
she
did
beat
me
,
*NL*
what
then
?
What
of
it
?
You
know
nothing
,
nothing
about
it
...
She
is
so
*NL*
unhappy
...
ah
,
how
unhappy
!
And
ill
...
She
is
seeking
righteousness
,
*NL*
she
is
pure
.
She
has
such
faith
that
there
must
be
righteousness
*NL*
everywhere
and
she
expects
it
...
And
if
you
were
to
torture
her
,
she
*NL*
would
n't
do
wrong
.
She
does
n't
see
that
it
's
impossible
for
people
to
*NL*
be
righteous
and
she
is
angry
at
it
.
Like
a
child
,
like
a
child
.
She
is
*NL*
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
happen
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
at
him
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
left
on
your
hands
,
you
see
.
They
were
all
on
your
hands
*NL*
before
,
though
...
And
your
father
came
to
you
to
beg
for
drink
.
Well
,
*NL*
how
will
it
be
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
Sonia
articulated
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
they
stay
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
...
They
are
in
debt
for
the
lodging
,
but
the
landlady
,
*NL*
I
hear
,
said
to-day
that
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
,
and
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
says
that
she
wo
n't
stay
another
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
she
is
so
bold
?
She
relies
upon
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
do
n't
talk
like
that
...
We
are
one
,
we
live
like
one
.
''
Sonia
*NL*
was
agitated
again
and
even
angry
,
as
though
a
canary
or
some
other
*NL*
little
bird
were
to
be
angry
.
``
And
what
could
she
do
?
What
,
what
could
*NL*
she
do
?
''
she
persisted
,
getting
hot
and
excited
.
``
And
how
she
cried
*NL*
to-day
!
Her
mind
is
unhinged
,
have
n't
you
noticed
it
?
At
one
minute
she
*NL*
is
worrying
like
a
child
that
everything
should
be
right
to-morrow
,
the
*NL*
lunch
and
all
that
...
Then
she
is
wringing
her
hands
,
spitting
blood
,
*NL*
weeping
,
and
all
at
once
she
will
begin
knocking
her
head
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
in
despair
.
Then
she
will
be
comforted
again
.
She
builds
all
her
*NL*
hopes
on
you
;
she
says
that
you
will
help
her
now
and
that
she
will
*NL*
borrow
a
little
money
somewhere
and
go
to
her
native
town
with
me
and
*NL*
set
up
a
boarding
school
for
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
and
take
me
to
*NL*
superintend
it
,
and
we
will
begin
a
new
splendid
life
.
And
she
kisses
*NL*
and
hugs
me
,
comforts
me
,
and
you
know
she
has
such
faith
,
such
faith
in
*NL*
her
fancies
!
One
ca
n't
contradict
her
.
And
all
the
day
long
she
has
been
*NL*
washing
,
cleaning
,
mending
.
She
dragged
the
wash
tub
into
the
room
with
*NL*
her
feeble
hands
and
sank
on
the
bed
,
gasping
for
breath
.
We
went
this
*NL*
morning
to
the
shops
to
buy
shoes
for
Polenka
and
Lida
for
theirs
are
*NL*
quite
worn
out
.
Only
the
money
we
'd
reckoned
was
n't
enough
,
not
nearly
*NL*
enough
.
And
she
picked
out
such
dear
little
boots
,
for
she
has
taste
,
*NL*
you
do
n't
know
.
And
there
in
the
shop
she
burst
out
crying
before
the
*NL*
shopmen
because
she
had
n't
enough
...
Ah
,
it
was
sad
to
see
her
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
after
that
I
can
understand
your
living
like
this
,
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
said
with
a
bitter
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
n't
you
sorry
for
them
?
Are
n't
you
sorry
?
''
Sonia
flew
at
him
*NL*
again
.
``
Why
,
I
know
,
you
gave
your
last
penny
yourself
,
though
you
'd
*NL*
seen
nothing
of
it
,
and
if
you
'd
seen
everything
,
oh
dear
!
And
how
*NL*
often
,
how
often
I
've
brought
her
to
tears
!
Only
last
week
!
Yes
,
I
!
Only
*NL*
a
week
before
his
death
.
I
was
cruel
!
And
how
often
I
've
done
it
!
Ah
,
*NL*
I
've
been
wretched
at
the
thought
of
it
all
day
!

*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
wrung
her
hands
as
she
spoke
at
the
pain
of
remembering
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
cruel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
--
I.
I
went
to
see
them
,
''
she
went
on
,
weeping
,
``
and
father
said
,
*NL*
`
read
me
something
,
Sonia
,
my
head
aches
,
read
to
me
,
here
's
a
book
.
'
He
*NL*
had
a
book
he
had
got
from
Andrey
Semyonovitch
Lebeziatnikov
,
he
lives
*NL*
there
,
he
always
used
to
get
hold
of
such
funny
books
.
And
I
said
,
'
I
*NL*
ca
n't
stay
,
'
as
I
did
n't
want
to
read
,
and
I
'd
gone
in
chiefly
to
show
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
some
collars
.
Lizaveta
,
the
pedlar
,
sold
me
some
*NL*
collars
and
cuffs
cheap
,
pretty
,
new
,
embroidered
ones
.
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
liked
them
very
much
;
she
put
them
on
and
looked
at
herself
*NL*
in
the
glass
and
was
delighted
with
them
.
`
Make
me
a
present
of
them
,
*NL*
Sonia
,
'
she
said
,
`
please
do
.
'
'
_
Please
do
_
,
'
she
said
,
she
wanted
them
*NL*
so
much
.
And
when
could
she
wear
them
?
They
just
reminded
her
of
her
old
*NL*
happy
days
.
She
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
,
admired
herself
,
and
she
*NL*
has
no
clothes
at
all
,
no
things
of
her
own
,
has
n't
had
all
these
years
!
*NL*
And
she
never
asks
anyone
for
anything
;
she
is
proud
,
she
'd
sooner
give
*NL*
away
everything
.
And
these
she
asked
for
,
she
liked
them
so
much
.
And
I
*NL*
was
sorry
to
give
them
.
`
What
use
are
they
to
you
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
?
'
I
*NL*
said
.
I
spoke
like
that
to
her
,
I
ought
not
to
have
said
that
!
She
gave
*NL*
me
such
a
look
.
And
she
was
so
grieved
,
so
grieved
at
my
refusing
her
.
*NL*
And
it
was
so
sad
to
see
...
And
she
was
not
grieved
for
the
collars
,
*NL*
but
for
my
refusing
,
I
saw
that
.
Ah
,
if
only
I
could
bring
it
all
back
,
*NL*
change
it
,
take
back
those
words
!
Ah
,
if
I.
.
.
but
it
's
nothing
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
Lizaveta
,
the
pedlar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
Did
you
know
her
?
''
Sonia
asked
with
some
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Ivanovna
is
in
consumption
,
rapid
consumption
;
she
will
soon
*NL*
die

''
said
Raskolnikov
after
a
pause
,
without
answering
her
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Sonia
unconsciously
clutched
both
his
hands
,
as
though
imploring
*NL*
that
she
should
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
will
be
better
if
she
does
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
better
,
not
at
all
better
!
''
Sonia
unconsciously
repeated
in
*NL*
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
children
?
What
can
you
do
except
take
them
to
live
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
cried
Sonia
,
almost
in
despair
,
and
she
put
her
*NL*
hands
to
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
that
idea
had
very
often
occurred
to
her
before
and
*NL*
he
had
only
roused
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
what
,
if
even
now
,
while
Katerina
Ivanovna
is
alive
,
you
get
ill
*NL*
and
are
taken
to
the
hospital
,
what
will
happen
then
?
''
he
persisted
*NL*
pitilessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
?
That
can
not
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Sonia
's
face
worked
with
awful
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
not
be
?
''
Raskolnikov
went
on
with
a
harsh
smile
.
``
You
are
not
*NL*
insured
against
it

are
you

What
will
happen
to

then

They

be
in
the
street
,
all
of
them

she
will
cough
and
beg
and
knock
her
head
*NL*
against
some
wall
,
as
she
did
to-day
,
and
the
children
will
cry
...
*NL*
Then
she
will
fall
down
,
be
taken
to
the
police
station
and
to
the
*NL*
hospital

she
will
die

and
the
children

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

God
will
not
let
it
be

''
broke
at
last
from
Sonia
's
*NL*
overburdened
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
,
looking
imploringly
at
him
,
clasping
her
hands
in
dumb
*NL*
entreaty
,
as
though
it
all
depended
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
.
A
minute
passed
.
*NL*
Sonia
was
standing
with
her
hands
and
her
head
hanging
in
terrible
*NL*
dejection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ca
n't
you
save
?
Put
by
for
a
rainy
day
?
''
he
asked
,
stopping
*NL*
suddenly
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
whispered
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
.
Have
you
tried
?
''
he
added
almost
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
did
n't
come
off
!
Of
course
not
!
No
need
to
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
paced
the
room
.
Another
minute
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
get
money
every
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
was
more
confused
than
ever
and
colour
rushed
into
her
face
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
whispered
with
a
painful
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
the
same
with
Polenka
,
no
doubt

''
he
said
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
It
ca
n't
be

no

Sonia
cried
aloud
in
desperation
,
as
though
*NL*
she
had
been
stabbed
.
``
God
would
not
allow
anything
so
awful

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lets
others
come
to
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

God
will
protect
her

God
!

she
repeated
beside
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
perhaps
,
there
is
no
God
at
all

''
Raskolnikov
answered
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
malignance
,
laughed
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
's
face
suddenly
changed
;
a
tremor
passed
over
it
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
him
with
unutterable
reproach
,
tried
to
say
something
,
but
could
not
*NL*
speak
and
broke
into
bitter
,
bitter
sobs
,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
mind
is
unhinged
;
your
own
mind
is
*NL*
unhinged
,
''
he
said
after
a
brief
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
passed
.
He
still
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence
,
not
*NL*
looking
at
her
.
At
last
he
went
up
to
her
;
his
eyes
glittered
.
He
put
*NL*
his
two
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
straight
into
her
tearful
*NL*
face
.
His
eyes
were
hard
,
feverish
and
piercing
,
his
lips
were
*NL*
twitching
.
All
at
once
he
bent
down
quickly
and
dropping
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
kissed
her
foot
.
Sonia
drew
back
from
him
as
from
a
madman
.
And
*NL*
certainly
he
looked
like
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
to
me
?
''
she
muttered
,
turning
pale
,
and
a
sudden
*NL*
anguish
clutched
at
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
bow
down
to
you
,
I
bowed
down
to
all
the
suffering
of
*NL*
humanity

''
he
said
wildly
and
walked
away
to
the
window
.
``
Listen
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
turning
to
her
a
minute
later
.
``
I
said
just
now
to
an
insolent
*NL*
man
that
he
was
not
worth
your
little
finger
...
and
that
I
did
my
sister
*NL*
honour
making
her
sit
beside
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
you
said
that
to
them
!
And
in
her
presence
?
''
cried
Sonia
,
*NL*
frightened
.
``
Sit
down
with
me
!
An
honour
!
Why
,
I
'm
...
dishonourable
...
*NL*
Ah
,
why
did
you
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
because
of
your
dishonour
and
your
sin
I
said
that
of
you
,
*NL*
but
because
of
your
great
suffering
.
But
you
are
a
great
sinner
,
that
's
*NL*
true
,
''
he
added
almost
solemnly
,
``
and
your
worst
sin
is
that
you
have
*NL*
destroyed
and
betrayed
yourself
_
for
nothing
_
.
Is
n't
that
fearful
?
Is
n't
*NL*
it
fearful
that
you
are
living
in
this
filth
which
you
loathe
so
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
you
know
yourself
-LRB-
you
've
only
to
open
your
eyes
-RRB-
that
you
*NL*
are
not
helping
anyone
by
it
,
not
saving
anyone
from
anything
?
Tell
me
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
almost
in
a
frenzy
,
``
how
this
shame
and
degradation
can
exist
*NL*
in
you
side
by
side
with
other
,
opposite
,
holy
feelings
?
It
would
be
*NL*
better
,
a
thousand
times
better
and
wiser
to
leap
into
the
water
and
end
*NL*
it
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
would
become
of
them
?
''
Sonia
asked
faintly
,
gazing
at
him
with
*NL*
eyes
of
anguish
,
but
not
seeming
surprised
at
his
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
strangely
at
her
.
He
read
it
all
in
her
face
;
so
she
*NL*
must
have
had
that
thought
already
,
perhaps
many
times
,
and
earnestly
*NL*
she
had
thought
out
in
her
despair
how
to
end
it
and
so
earnestly
,
that
*NL*
now
she
scarcely
wondered
at
his
suggestion
.
She
had
not
even
noticed
*NL*
the
cruelty
of
his
words
.
-LRB-
The
significance
of
his
reproaches
and
his
*NL*
peculiar
attitude
to
her
shame
she
had
,
of
course
,
not
noticed
either
,
*NL*
and
that
,
too
,
was
clear
to
him
.
-RRB-
But
he
saw
how
monstrously
the
thought
*NL*
of
her
disgraceful
,
shameful
position
was
torturing
her
and
had
long
*NL*
tortured
her
.
``
What
,
what
,
''
he
thought
,
``
could
hitherto
have
hindered
*NL*
her
from
putting
an
end
to
it
?
''
Only
then
he
realised
what
those
poor
*NL*
little
orphan
children
and
that
pitiful
half-crazy
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
knocking
her
head
against
the
wall
in
her
consumption
,
meant
for
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
nevertheless
,
it
was
clear
to
him
again
that
with
her
character
and
*NL*
the
amount
of
education
she
had
after
all
received
,
she
could
not
in
any
*NL*
case
remain
so
.
He
was
still
confronted
by
the
question
,
how
could
she
*NL*
have
remained
so
long
in
that
position
without
going
out
of
her
mind
,
*NL*
since
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
jump
into
the
water
?
Of
course
he
*NL*
knew
that
Sonia
's
position
was
an
exceptional
case
,
though
unhappily
not
*NL*
unique
and
not
infrequent
,
indeed
;
but
that
very
exceptionalness
,
her
*NL*
tinge
of
education
,
her
previous
life
might
,
one
would
have
thought
,
*NL*
have
killed
her
at
the
first
step
on
that
revolting
path
.
What
held
her
*NL*
up
--
surely
not
depravity
?
All
that
infamy
had
obviously
only
touched
*NL*
her
mechanically
,
not
one
drop
of
real
depravity
had
penetrated
to
her
*NL*
heart
;
he
saw
that
.
He
saw
through
her
as
she
stood
before
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
three
ways
before
her
,
''
he
thought
,
``
the
canal
,
the
madhouse
,
*NL*
or
...
at
last
to
sink
into
depravity
which
obscures
the
mind
and
turns
*NL*
the
heart
to
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
idea
was
the
most
revolting
,
but
he
was
a
sceptic
,
he
was
*NL*
young
,
abstract
,
and
therefore
cruel
,
and
so
he
could
not
help
believing
*NL*
that
the
last
end
was
the
most
likely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
that
be
true
?
''
he
cried
to
himself
.
``
Can
that
creature
who
has
*NL*
still
preserved
the
purity
of
her
spirit
be
consciously
drawn
at
last
*NL*
into
that
sink
of
filth
and
iniquity
?
Can
the
process
already
have
*NL*
begun
?
Can
it
be
that
she
has
only
been
able
to
bear
it
till
now
,
*NL*
because
vice
has
begun
to
be
less
loathsome
to
her
?
No
,
no
,
that
can
not
*NL*
be
!
''
he
cried
,
as
Sonia
had
just
before
.
``
No
,
what
has
kept
her
from
the
*NL*
canal
till
now
is
the
idea
of
sin
and
they
,
the
children
...
And
if
she
*NL*
has
not
gone
out
of
her
mind
...
but
who
says
she
has
not
gone
out
of
her
*NL*
mind
?
Is
she
in
her
senses
?
Can
one
talk
,
can
one
reason
as
she
does
?
*NL*
How
can
she
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
of
loathsomeness
into
which
she
*NL*
is
slipping
and
refuse
to
listen
when
she
is
told
of
danger
?
Does
she
*NL*
expect
a
miracle
?
No
doubt
she
does
.
Does
n't
that
all
mean
madness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stayed
obstinately
at
that
thought
.
He
liked
that
explanation
indeed
*NL*
better
than
any
other
.
He
began
looking
more
intently
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
pray
to
God
a
great
deal
,
Sonia
?
''
he
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
did
not
speak
;
he
stood
beside
her
waiting
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
be
without
God
?
''
she
whispered
rapidly
,
forcibly
,
*NL*
glancing
at
him
with
suddenly
flashing
eyes
,
and
squeezing
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
that
is
it
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
God
do
for
you
?
''
he
asked
,
probing
her
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
was
silent
a
long
while
,
as
though
she
could
not
answer
.
Her
weak
*NL*
chest
kept
heaving
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
!
Do
n't
ask
!
You
do
n't
deserve
!
''
she
cried
suddenly
,
looking
*NL*
sternly
and
wrathfully
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
that
's
it
,
''
he
repeated
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
everything
,
''
she
whispered
quickly
,
looking
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
out
!
That
's
the
explanation
,
''
he
decided
,
scrutinising
*NL*
her
with
eager
curiosity
,
with
a
new
,
strange
,
almost
morbid
feeling
.
*NL*
He
gazed
at
that
pale
,
thin
,
irregular
,
angular
little
face
,
those
soft
*NL*
blue
eyes
,
which
could
flash
with
such
fire
,
such
stern
energy
,
that
*NL*
little
body
still
shaking
with
indignation
and
anger
--
and
it
all
seemed
*NL*
to
him
more
and
more
strange
,
almost
impossible
.
``
She
is
a
religious
*NL*
maniac
!
''
he
repeated
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
book
lying
on
the
chest
of
drawers
.
He
had
noticed
it
every
*NL*
time
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
.
Now
he
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
.
*NL*
It
was
the
New
Testament
in
the
Russian
translation
.
It
was
bound
in
*NL*
leather
,
old
and
worn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
get
that
?
''
he
called
to
her
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
standing
in
the
same
place
,
three
steps
from
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
brought
me
,
''
she
answered
,
as
it
were
unwillingly
,
not
looking
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
brought
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizaveta
,
I
asked
her
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizaveta
!
strange
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
about
Sonia
seemed
to
him
stranger
and
more
wonderful
every
*NL*
moment
.
He
carried
the
book
to
the
candle
and
began
to
turn
over
the
*NL*
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
story
of
Lazarus
?
''
he
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
obstinately
at
the
ground
and
would
not
answer
.
She
was
*NL*
standing
sideways
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
raising
of
Lazarus
?
Find
it
for
me
,
Sonia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stole
a
glance
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
looking
in
the
right
place
...
It
's
in
the
fourth
gospel
,
''
*NL*
she
whispered
sternly
,
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
it
and
read
it
to
me
,
''
he
said
.
He
sat
down
with
his
elbow
on
the
*NL*
table
,
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looked
away
sullenly
,
prepared
to
*NL*
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
three
weeks
'
time
they
'll
welcome
me
in
the
madhouse
!
I
shall
be
*NL*
there
if
I
am
not
in
a
worse
place
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
heard
Raskolnikov
's
request
distrustfully
and
moved
hesitatingly
*NL*
to
the
table
.
She
took
the
book
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
read
it
?
''
she
asked
,
looking
up
at
him
across
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
became
sterner
and
sterner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
ago
...
When
I
was
at
school
.
Read
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
n't
you
heard
it
in
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
have
n't
been
.
Do
you
often
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
,
''
whispered
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
...
And
you
wo
n't
go
to
your
father
's
funeral
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
.
I
was
at
church
last
week
,
too
...
I
had
a
requiem
*NL*
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Lizaveta
.
She
was
killed
with
an
axe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
nerves
were
more
and
more
strained
.
His
head
began
to
go
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
friends
with
Lizaveta
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
She
was
good
...
she
used
to
come
...
not
often
...
she
*NL*
could
n't
...
We
used
to
read
together
and
...
talk
.
She
will
see
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
phrase
sounded
strange
in
his
ears
.
And
here
was
something
new
*NL*
again
:
the
mysterious
meetings
with
Lizaveta
and
both
of
them
--
religious
*NL*
maniacs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
a
religious
maniac
myself
soon
!
It
's
infectious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
!
''
he
cried
irritably
and
insistently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
still
hesitated
.
Her
heart
was
throbbing
.
She
hardly
dared
to
read
*NL*
to
him
.
He
looked
almost
with
exasperation
at
the
``
unhappy
lunatic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
You
do
n't
believe
?
...
''
she
whispered
softly
and
as
it
were
*NL*
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
!
I
want
you
to
,
''
he
persisted
.
``
You
used
to
read
to
Lizaveta
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
opened
the
book
and
found
the
place
.
Her
hands
were
shaking
,
her
*NL*
voice
failed
her
.
Twice
she
tried
to
begin
and
could
not
bring
out
the
*NL*
first
syllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
a
certain
man
was
sick
named
Lazarus
of
Bethany
...
''
she
forced
*NL*
herself
at
last
to
read
,
but
at
the
third
word
her
voice
broke
like
an
*NL*
overstrained
string
.
There
was
a
catch
in
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
saw
in
part
why
Sonia
could
not
bring
herself
to
read
to
him
*NL*
and
the
more
he
saw
this
,
the
more
roughly
and
irritably
he
insisted
on
*NL*
her
doing
so
.
He
understood
only
too
well
how
painful
it
was
for
her
*NL*
to
betray
and
unveil
all
that
was
her
_
own
_
.
He
understood
that
these
*NL*
feelings
really
were
her
_
secret
treasure
_
,
which
she
had
kept
perhaps
*NL*
for
years
,
perhaps
from
childhood
,
while
she
lived
with
an
unhappy
*NL*
father
and
a
distracted
stepmother
crazed
by
grief
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
starving
children
and
unseemly
abuse
and
reproaches
.
But
at
the
same
*NL*
time
he
knew
now
and
knew
for
certain
that
,
although
it
filled
her
with
*NL*
dread
and
suffering
,
yet
she
had
a
tormenting
desire
to
read
and
to
read
*NL*
to
_
him
_
that
he
might
hear
it
,
and
to
read
_
now
_
whatever
might
come
of
*NL*
it
!
...
He
read
this
in
her
eyes
,
he
could
see
it
in
her
intense
emotion
.
*NL*
She
mastered
herself
,
controlled
the
spasm
in
her
throat
and
went
on
*NL*
reading
the
eleventh
chapter
of
St.
John
.
She
went
on
to
the
nineteenth
*NL*
verse
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
many
of
the
Jews
came
to
Martha
and
Mary
to
comfort
them
concerning
*NL*
their
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Martha
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
went
and
met
*NL*
Him
:
but
Mary
sat
still
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
said
Martha
unto
Jesus
,
Lord
,
if
Thou
hadst
been
here
,
my
brother
*NL*
had
not
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
that
even
now
whatsoever
Thou
wilt
ask
of
God
,
God
will
give
*NL*
it
Thee
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
stopped
again
with
a
shamefaced
feeling
that
her
voice
would
*NL*
quiver
and
break
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus
said
unto
her
,
thy
brother
shall
rise
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
saith
unto
Him
,
I
know
that
he
shall
rise
again
in
the
*NL*
resurrection
,
at
the
last
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus
said
unto
her
,
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life

he
that
*NL*
believeth
in
Me

he
were
dead
,
yet
shall
he
live

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
-LRB-
And
drawing
a
painful
breath
,
Sonia
read
distinctly
and
forcibly
as
*NL*
though
she
were
making
a
public
confession
of
faith

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
and
looked
up
quickly
at
him
,

controlling
herself
went
*NL*
on
reading

Raskolnikov
sat
without
moving

his

on
the
table
and
*NL*
his
eyes
turned
away

She
read
to
the
thirty-second
verse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
when
Mary
was

down

unto

When

saw

weeping

Jews
also
weeping

came
with

He

in

was
troubled

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
emotion

Yes
,
he
had
known
it
!
*NL*
She
was
trembling
in
a
real
physical
fever
.
He
had
expected
it
.
She
was
*NL*
getting
near
the
story
of
the
greatest
miracle

a
feeling

immense

triumph
came
over

Her

rang
out

triumph

joy

gave
it
power

The
lines
danced
before
her

she
knew
what

was
reading

heart

At
the
last
verse
``

dropping
her
voice
she
passionately
reproduced
*NL*
the
doubt

the
reproach
and
censure
of
the
blind
disbelieving
Jews
,
who
*NL*
in
another

would
fall
at

struck

was
what

she
was
quivering
with
happy

anticipation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus

not

The
candle-end
was

flickering
out
in

battered

dimly
lighting
up
in

poverty-stricken
room
the
murderer

the
harlot

had
so
strangely

been
reading
together
the

Five

more
passed

*NL*
*NL*

aloud

frowning

He
got
*NL*
up
and
went
to
Sonia

She
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
in
silence

His
face
*NL*
was
particularly
stern
and
there
was
a
sort
of
savage
determination
in
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
abandoned

*NL*
*NL*
``

asked
Sonia
amazed

Her
recent
meeting
with
his

had
left
a
great
impression

could
not
analyse

She
*NL*
heard
his

almost
with
horror

*NL*
*NL*
``

His

Sonia
thought

in

asked

She
looked
at

understood
nothing

terribly

infinitely
unhappy

agitated

*NL*

``
What

weeping

hysterically
and
wringing
her

*NL*
*NL*
``

started
with
terror

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

do
you
know
who
killed
her

she
asked

chilled
with
horror

*NL*
looking
wildly
at
him

*NL*
*NL*

simply

out
long
ago
to
hear
this

when
your
father
talked
of
you
and
when
*NL*
Lizaveta
was
alive

I
thought

To-morrow

He
went
out

Sonia
gazed
at
him
as
at
a
madman
.
But
she
herself
was
like
*NL*
one
insane
and
felt
it

Her
head
was
going
round

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

does

But
at
the

_
the
idea

did
not
enter

not

And

kissed

foot

said

said
it
clearly

not

without
her

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
spent
the
whole
night
feverish
and
delirious
.
She
jumped
up
from
*NL*
time
to
time
,
wept
and
wrung
her
hands
,
then
sank
again
into
feverish
*NL*
sleep
and
dreamt
of
Polenka
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
Lizaveta
,
of
reading
*NL*
the
gospel
and
him
...
him
with
pale
face
,
with
burning
eyes
...
kissing
*NL*
her
feet
,
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
door
on
the
right
,
which
divided
Sonia
's
room
*NL*
from
Madame
Resslich
's
flat
,
was
a
room
which
had
long
stood
empty
.
A
*NL*
card
was
fixed
on
the
gate
and
a
notice
stuck
in
the
windows
over
the
*NL*
canal
advertising
it
to
let
.
Sonia
had
long
been
accustomed
to
the
*NL*
room
's
being
uninhabited
.
But
all
that
time
Mr.
Svidrigailov
had
been
*NL*
standing
,
listening
at
the
door
of
the
empty
room
.
When
Raskolnikov
went
*NL*
out
he
stood
still
,
thought
a
moment
,
went
on
tiptoe
to
his
own
room
*NL*
which
adjoined
the
empty
one
,
brought
a
chair
and
noiselessly
carried
it
*NL*
to
the
door
that
led
to
Sonia
's
room
.
The
conversation
had
struck
him
*NL*
as
interesting
and
remarkable
,
and
he
had
greatly
enjoyed
it
--
so
much
so
*NL*
that
he
brought
a
chair
that
he
might
not
in
the
future
,
to-morrow
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
have
to
endure
the
inconvenience
of
standing
a
whole
hour
,
but
*NL*
might
listen
in
comfort
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
When
next
morning
at
eleven
o'clock
punctually
Raskolnikov
went
into
the
*NL*
department
of
the
investigation
of
criminal
causes
and
sent
his
name
in
*NL*
to
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
he
was
surprised
at
being
kept
waiting
so
long
:
*NL*
it
was
at
least
ten
minutes
before
he
was
summoned
.
He
had
expected
*NL*
that
they
would
pounce
upon
him
.
But
he
stood
in
the
waiting-room
,
and
*NL*
people
,
who
apparently
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
were
continually
*NL*
passing
to
and
fro
before
him
.
In
the
next
room
which
looked
like
an
*NL*
office
,
several
clerks
were
sitting
writing
and
obviously
they
had
*NL*
no
notion
who
or
what
Raskolnikov
might
be
.
He
looked
uneasily
and
*NL*
suspiciously
about
him
to
see
whether
there
was
not
some
guard
,
some
*NL*
mysterious
watch
being
kept
on
him
to
prevent
his
escape
.
But
there
was
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
:
he
saw
only
the
faces
of
clerks
absorbed
in
petty
*NL*
details
,
then
other
people
,
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
concern
with
him
.
*NL*
He
might
go
where
he
liked
for
them
.
The
conviction
grew
stronger
in
him
*NL*
that
if
that
enigmatic
man
of
yesterday
,
that
phantom
sprung
out
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
had
seen
everything
,
they
would
not
have
let
him
stand
and
wait
*NL*
like
that
.
And
would
they
have
waited
till
he
elected
to
appear
at
*NL*
eleven
?
Either
the
man
had
not
yet
given
information
,
or
...
or
simply
*NL*
he
knew
nothing
,
had
seen
nothing
-LRB-
and
how
could
he
have
seen
anything
?
-RRB-
*NL*
and
so
all
that
had
happened
to
him
the
day
before
was
again
a
phantom
*NL*
exaggerated
by
his
sick
and
overstrained
imagination
.
This
conjecture
*NL*
had
begun
to
grow
strong
the
day
before
,
in
the
midst
of
all
his
*NL*
alarm
and
despair
.
Thinking
it
all
over
now
and
preparing
for
a
fresh
*NL*
conflict
,
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
he
was
trembling
--
and
he
felt
a
*NL*
rush
of
indignation
at
the
thought
that
he
was
trembling
with
fear
at
*NL*
facing
that
hateful
Porfiry
Petrovitch
.
What
he
dreaded
above
all
was
*NL*
meeting
that
man
again
;
he
hated
him
with
an
intense
,
unmitigated
hatred
*NL*
and
was
afraid
his
hatred
might
betray
him
.
His
indignation
was
such
*NL*
that
he
ceased
trembling
at
once
;
he
made
ready
to
go
in
with
a
cold
and
*NL*
arrogant
bearing
and
vowed
to
himself
to
keep
as
silent
as
possible
,
*NL*
to
watch
and
listen
and
for
once
at
least
to
control
his
overstrained
*NL*
nerves
.
At
that
moment
he
was
summoned
to
Porfiry
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Porfiry
Petrovitch
alone
in
his
study
.
His
study
was
a
room
*NL*
neither
large
nor
small
,
furnished
with
a
large
writing-table
,
that
*NL*
stood
before
a
sofa
,
upholstered
in
checked
material
,
a
bureau
,
a
*NL*
bookcase
in
the
corner
and
several
chairs
--
all
government
furniture
,
*NL*
of
polished
yellow
wood
.
In
the
further
wall
there
was
a
closed
door
,
*NL*
beyond
it
there
were
no
doubt
other
rooms
.
On
Raskolnikov
's
entrance
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
had
at
once
closed
the
door
by
which
he
had
come
in
*NL*
and
they
remained
alone
.
He
met
his
visitor
with
an
apparently
genial
*NL*
and
good-tempered
air
,
and
it
was
only
after
a
few
minutes
that
*NL*
Raskolnikov
saw
signs
of
a
certain
awkwardness
in
him
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
been
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
or
caught
in
something
very
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
fellow
!
Here
you
are
...
in
our
domain
''
...
began
Porfiry
,
*NL*
holding
out
both
hands
to
him
.
``
Come
,
sit
down
,
old
man
...
or
perhaps
*NL*
you
do
n't
like
to
be
called
`
my
dear
fellow
'
and
`
old
man
!
'
--
_
tout
*NL*
court
_
?
Please
do
n't
think
it
too
familiar
...
Here
,
on
the
sofa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
sat
down
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
.
``
In
our
domain
,
''
*NL*
the
apologies
for
familiarity
,
the
French
phrase
_
tout
court
_
,
were
all
*NL*
characteristic
signs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
held
out
both
hands
to
me
,
but
he
did
not
give
me
one
--
he
drew
it
*NL*
back
in
time
,
''
struck
him
suspiciously
.
Both
were
watching
each
other
,
*NL*
but
when
their
eyes
met
,
quick
as
lightning
they
looked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
brought
you
this
paper
...
about
the
watch
.
Here
it
is
.
Is
it
all
*NL*
right
or
shall
I
copy
it
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
A
paper
?
Yes
,
yes
,
do
n't
be
uneasy
,
it
's
all
right
,
''
Porfiry
*NL*
Petrovitch
said
as
though
in
haste
,
and
after
he
had
said
it
he
took
the
*NL*
paper
and
looked
at
it
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
right
.
Nothing
more
is
needed
,
''
*NL*
he
declared
with
the
same
rapidity
and
he
laid
the
paper
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
when
he
was
talking
of
something
else
he
took
it
from
the
*NL*
table
and
put
it
on
his
bureau
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
said
yesterday
you
would
like
to
question
me
...
*NL*
formally
...
about
my
acquaintance
with
the
murdered
woman
?
''
Raskolnikov
*NL*
was
beginning
again
.
``
Why
did
I
put
in
'
I
believe
'
''
passed
through
*NL*
his
mind
in
a
flash
.
``
Why
am
I
so
uneasy
at
having
put
in
that
'
_
I
*NL*
believe
_
'
?
''
came
in
a
second
flash
.
And
he
suddenly
felt
that
his
*NL*
uneasiness
at
the
mere
contact
with
Porfiry
,
at
the
first
words
,
at
the
*NL*
first
looks
,
had
grown
in
an
instant
to
monstrous
proportions
,
and
that
*NL*
this
was
fearfully
dangerous
.
His
nerves
were
quivering
,
his
emotion
was
*NL*
increasing
.
``
It
's
bad
,
it
's
bad
!
I
shall
say
too
much
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
There
's
no
hurry
,
there
's
no
hurry
,
''
muttered
Porfiry
*NL*
Petrovitch
,
moving
to
and
fro
about
the
table
without
any
apparent
aim
,
*NL*
as
it
were
making
dashes
towards
the
window
,
the
bureau
and
the
table
,
*NL*
at
one
moment
avoiding
Raskolnikov
's
suspicious
glance
,
then
again
*NL*
standing
still
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
fat
round
little
figure
looked
very
strange
,
like
a
ball
rolling
*NL*
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
rebounding
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
plenty
of
time
.
Do
you
smoke
?
have
you
your
own
?
Here
,
a
*NL*
cigarette
!
''
he
went
on
,
offering
his
visitor
a
cigarette
.
``
You
know
I
am
*NL*
receiving
you
here
,
but
my
own
quarters
are
through
there
,
you
know
,
my
*NL*
government
quarters
.
But
I
am
living
outside
for
the
time
,
I
had
to
*NL*
have
some
repairs
done
here
.
It
's
almost
finished
now
...
Government
*NL*
quarters
,
you
know
,
are
a
capital
thing
.
Eh
,
what
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
capital
thing
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
,
looking
at
him
almost
*NL*
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
capital
thing
,
a
capital
thing
,
''
repeated
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
just
thought
of
something
quite
different
.
``
Yes
,
a
capital
*NL*
thing
,
''
he
almost
shouted
at
last
,
suddenly
staring
at
Raskolnikov
and
*NL*
stopping
short
two
steps
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stupid
repetition
was
too
incongruous
in
its
ineptitude
with
the
*NL*
serious
,
brooding
and
enigmatic
glance
he
turned
upon
his
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
stirred
Raskolnikov
's
spleen
more
than
ever
and
he
could
not
*NL*
resist
an
ironical
and
rather
incautious
challenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
please
,
''
he
asked
suddenly
,
looking
almost
insolently
at
him
*NL*
and
taking
a
kind
of
pleasure
in
his
own
insolence
.
``
I
believe
it
's
a
*NL*
sort
of
legal
rule
,
a
sort
of
legal
tradition
--
for
all
investigating
*NL*
lawyers
--
to
begin
their
attack
from
afar
,
with
a
trivial
,
or
at
least
*NL*
an
irrelevant
subject
,
so
as
to
encourage
,
or
rather
,
to
divert
the
man
*NL*
they
are
cross-examining
,
to
disarm
his
caution
and
then
all
at
once
to
*NL*
give
him
an
unexpected
knock-down
blow
with
some
fatal
question
.
Is
n't
*NL*
that
so
?
It
's
a
sacred
tradition
,
mentioned
,
I
fancy
,
in
all
the
manuals
*NL*
of
the
art
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
...
Why
,
do
you
imagine
that
was
why
I
spoke
about
government
*NL*
quarters
...
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
said
this
Porfiry
Petrovitch
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
winked
;
*NL*
a
good-humoured
,
crafty
look
passed
over
his
face
.
The
wrinkles
on
his
*NL*
forehead
were
smoothed
out
,
his
eyes
contracted
,
his
features
broadened
*NL*
and
he
suddenly
went
off
into
a
nervous
prolonged
laugh
,
shaking
all
*NL*
over
and
looking
Raskolnikov
straight
in
the
face
.
The
latter
forced
*NL*
himself
to
laugh
,
too
,
but
when
Porfiry
,
seeing
that
he
was
laughing
,
*NL*
broke
into
such
a
guffaw
that
he
turned
almost
crimson
,
Raskolnikov
's
*NL*
repulsion
overcame
all
precaution
;
he
left
off
laughing
,
scowled
and
*NL*
stared
with
hatred
at
Porfiry
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
while
his
*NL*
intentionally
prolonged
laughter
lasted
.
There
was
lack
of
precaution
on
*NL*
both
sides
,
however
,
for
Porfiry
Petrovitch
seemed
to
be
laughing
in
*NL*
his
visitor
's
face
and
to
be
very
little
disturbed
at
the
annoyance
with
*NL*
which
the
visitor
received
it
.
The
latter
fact
was
very
significant
*NL*
in
Raskolnikov
's
eyes
:
he
saw
that
Porfiry
Petrovitch
had
not
been
*NL*
embarrassed
just
before
either
,
but
that
he
,
Raskolnikov
,
had
perhaps
*NL*
fallen
into
a
trap
;
that
there
must
be
something
,
some
motive
here
*NL*
unknown
to
him
;
that
,
perhaps
,
everything
was
in
readiness
and
in
*NL*
another
moment
would
break
upon
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
straight
to
the
point
at
once
,
rose
from
his
seat
and
took
his
*NL*
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
''
he
began
resolutely
,
though
with
considerable
*NL*
irritation
,
``
yesterday
you
expressed
a
desire
that
I
should
come
to
you
*NL*
for
some
inquiries
''
-LRB-
he
laid
special
stress
on
the
word
``
inquiries
''
-RRB-
.
``
I
*NL*
have
come
and
if
you
have
anything
to
ask
me
,
ask
it
,
and
if
not
,
allow
*NL*
me
to
withdraw
.
I
have
no
time
to
spare
...
I
have
to
be
at
the
funeral
*NL*
of
that
man
who
was
run
over
,
of
whom
you
...
know
also

''
he
added
,
*NL*
feeling
angry
at
once
at
having
made
this
addition
and
more
irritated
at
*NL*
his
anger
.
``
I
am
sick
of
it
all
,
do
you
hear
?
and
have
long
been
.
It
's
*NL*
partly
what
made
me
ill
.
In
short
,
''
he
shouted
,
feeling
that
the
phrase
*NL*
about
his
illness
was
still
more
out
of
place
,
``
in
short
,
kindly
examine
*NL*
me
or
let
me
go

at
once

And
if
you
must
examine
me
,
do
so
in
the
*NL*
proper
form
!
I
will
not
allow
you
to
do
so
otherwise
,
and
so
meanwhile
,
*NL*
good-bye
,
as
we
have
evidently
nothing
to
keep
us
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
What
do
you
mean
?
What
shall
I
question
you
about
?
''
*NL*
cackled
Porfiry
Petrovitch
with
a
change
of
tone
,
instantly
leaving
off
*NL*
laughing
.
``
Please
do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
''
he
began
fidgeting
from
place
*NL*
to
place
and
fussily
making
Raskolnikov
sit
down
.
``
There
's
no
hurry
,
*NL*
there
's
no
hurry

it
's
all
nonsense

Oh

no

I
'm
very
glad
you
've
come

to
see
me
at
last

I
look
upon

simply
as

And
as
for

my
confounded
laughter

please
excuse
it

Rodion
Romanovitch

Rodion
*NL*
Romanovitch
?
That
is
your
name

It
's
my
nerves
,
you
tickled
me
*NL*
so
with
your
witty
observation
;
I
assure
you
,
sometimes
I
shake
with
*NL*
laughter
like
an
india-rubber
ball
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
...
I
'm
*NL*
often
afraid
of
an
attack
of
paralysis
.
Do
sit
down
.
Please
do
,
or
I
*NL*
shall
think
you
are
angry

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
did
not
speak
;
he
listened
,
watching
him
,
still
frowning
*NL*
angrily
.
He
did
sit
down
,
but
still
held
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
one
thing
about
myself
,
my
dear
Rodion
Romanovitch

''
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
continued
,
moving
about
the
room
and
again
avoiding
*NL*
his
visitor
's
eyes
.
``
You
see
,
I
'm
a
bachelor

a
man

no
consequence

besides

I
have
nothing
before

I
'm
set
,
I
'm
*NL*
running
to
seed
and
...
and
have
you
noticed
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
that
in
*NL*
our
Petersburg
circles
,
if
two
clever
men
meet
who
are
not
intimate
,
but
*NL*
respect
each
other
,
like
you
and
me
,
it
takes
them
half
an
hour
before
*NL*
they
can
find
a
subject
for
conversation
--
they
are
dumb
,
they
sit
*NL*
opposite
each
other
and
feel
awkward
.
Everyone
has
subjects
of
*NL*
conversation

ladies
for
instance

people
in
high
society
always
have
*NL*
their
subjects
of
conversation

but
people
of
the
*NL*
middle
sort
like
us

thinking
people
that
is

are
always
tongue-tied
*NL*
and
awkward

What
is
the
reason
of
it
?
Whether
it
is
the
lack
of
public
*NL*
interest
,
or
whether
it
is
we
are
so
honest
we
do
n't
want
to
deceive
one
*NL*
another
,
I
do
n't
know

What
do
you
think
?
Do
put
down
your
cap
,
it
*NL*
looks
as
if
you
were
just
going
,
it
makes
me
uncomfortable
...
I
am
so
*NL*
delighted

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
put
down
his
cap
and
continued
listening
in
silence
with
*NL*
a
serious
frowning
face
to
the
vague
and
empty
chatter
of
Porfiry
*NL*
Petrovitch
.
``
Does

babble

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

but
why

spend
five
minutes
with
a

Porfiry
pattered
on
,
``
and
you

glad

moving
about

I
suffer
from

Raskolnikov
had
made
no
*NL*
observation
of
the
kind
.
-RRB-
``
One
gets
into
a
muddle
!
A
regular
muddle
!
One
*NL*
keeps
harping
on
the
same
note
,
like
a
drum
!
There
is
to
be
a
reform
and
*NL*
we
shall
be
called
by
a
different
name
,
at
least
,
he-he-he
!
And
as
for
*NL*
our
legal
tradition
,
as
you
so
wittily
called
it
,
I
thoroughly
agree
*NL*
with
you
.
Every
prisoner
on
trial
,
even
the
rudest
peasant
,
knows
that
*NL*
they
begin
by
disarming
him
with
irrelevant
questions
-LRB-
as
you
so
happily
*NL*
put
it
-RRB-
and
then
deal
him
a
knock-down
blow
,
he-he-he
!
--
your
felicitous
*NL*
comparison
,
he-he
!
So
you
really
imagined
that
I
meant
by
`
government
*NL*
quarters
'
...
he-he
!
You
are
an
ironical
person
.
Come
.
I
wo
n't
go
on
!
Ah
,
*NL*
by
the
way
,
yes
!
One
word
leads
to
another
.
You
spoke
of
formality
just
*NL*
now
,
apropos
of
the
inquiry
,
you
know
.
But
what
's
the
use
of
formality
?
*NL*
In
many
cases
it
's
nonsense
.
Sometimes
one
has
a
friendly
chat
and
gets
*NL*
a
good
deal
more
out
of
it
.
One
can
always
fall
back
on
formality
,
allow
*NL*
me
to
assure
you
.
And
after
all
,
what
does
it
amount
to
?
An
examining
*NL*
lawyer
can
not
be
bounded
by
formality
at
every
step
.
The
work
of
*NL*
investigation
is
,
so
to
speak
,
a
free
art
in
its
own
way
,
he-he-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
took
breath
a
moment
.
He
had
simply
babbled
on
*NL*
uttering
empty
phrases
,
letting
slip
a
few
enigmatic
words
and
again
*NL*
reverting
to
incoherence
.
He
was
almost
running
about
the
room
,
moving
*NL*
his
fat
little
legs
quicker
and
quicker
,
looking
at
the
ground
,
with
his
*NL*
right
hand
behind
his
back
,
while
with
his
left
making
gesticulations
*NL*
that
were
extraordinarily
incongruous
with
his
words
.
Raskolnikov
*NL*
suddenly
noticed
that
as
he
ran
about
the
room
he
seemed
twice
to
stop
*NL*
for
a
moment
near
the
door
,
as
though
he
were
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
expecting
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
certainly
quite
right
about
it
,
''
Porfiry
began
gaily
,
looking
*NL*
with
extraordinary
simplicity
at
Raskolnikov
-LRB-
which
startled
him
and
*NL*
instantly
put
him
on
his
guard
-RRB-
;
``
certainly
quite
right
in
laughing
so
*NL*
wittily
at
our
legal
forms
,
he-he
!
Some
of
these
elaborate
psychological
*NL*
methods
are
exceedingly
ridiculous
and
perhaps
useless
,
if
one
adheres
*NL*
too
closely
to
the
forms
.
Yes
...
I
am
talking
of
forms
again
.
Well
,
if
*NL*
I
recognise
,
or
more
strictly
speaking
,
if
I
suspect
someone
or
other
to
*NL*
be
a
criminal
in
any
case
entrusted
to
me
...
you
're
reading
for
the
law
,
*NL*
of
course
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
it
is
a
precedent
for
you
for
the
future
--
though
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
I
should
venture
to
instruct
you
after
the
articles
you
publish
*NL*
about
crime
!
No
,
I
simply
make
bold
to
state
it
by
way
of
fact
,
if
I
*NL*
took
this
man
or
that
for
a
criminal
,
why
,
I
ask
,
should
I
worry
him
*NL*
prematurely
,
even
though
I
had
evidence
against
him
?
In
one
case
I
may
*NL*
be
bound
,
for
instance
,
to
arrest
a
man
at
once
,
but
another
may
be
in
*NL*
quite
a
different
position
,
you
know
,
so
why
should
n't
I
let
him
walk
*NL*
about
the
town
a
bit
?
he-he-he
!
But
I
see
you
do
n't
quite
understand
,
so
*NL*
I
'll
give
you
a
clearer
example
.
If
I
put
him
in
prison
too
soon
,
I
*NL*
may
very
likely
give
him
,
so
to
speak
,
moral
support
,
he-he
!
You
're
*NL*
laughing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
no
idea
of
laughing
.
He
was
sitting
with
compressed
*NL*
lips
,
his
feverish
eyes
fixed
on
Porfiry
Petrovitch
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
that
is
the
case
,
with
some
types
especially
,
for
men
are
so
*NL*
different
.
You
say
`
evidence
'
.
Well
,
there
may
be
evidence
.
But
*NL*
evidence
,
you
know
,
can
generally
be
taken
two
ways
.
I
am
an
examining
*NL*
lawyer
and
a
weak
man
,
I
confess
it
.
I
should
like
to
make
a
proof
,
so
*NL*
to
say
,
mathematically
clear
.
I
should
like
to
make
a
chain
of
evidence
*NL*
such
as
twice
two
are
four
,
it
ought
to
be
a
direct
,
irrefutable
proof
!
*NL*
And
if
I
shut
him
up
too
soon
--
even
though
I
might
be
convinced
_
he
_
*NL*
was
the
man
,
I
should
very
likely
be
depriving
myself
of
the
means
of
*NL*
getting
further
evidence
against
him
.
And
how
?
By
giving
him
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
a
definite
position
,
I
shall
put
him
out
of
suspense
and
set
his
*NL*
mind
at
rest
,
so
that
he
will
retreat
into
his
shell
.
They
say
that
at
*NL*
Sevastopol
,
soon
after
Alma
,
the
clever
people
were
in
a
terrible
fright
*NL*
that
the
enemy
would
attack
openly
and
take
Sevastopol
at
once
.
But
when
*NL*
they
saw
that
the
enemy
preferred
a
regular
siege
,
they
were
delighted
,
*NL*
I
am
told
and
reassured
,
for
the
thing
would
drag
on
for
two
months
at
*NL*
least
.
You
're
laughing
,
you
do
n't
believe
me
again
?
Of
course
,
you
're
*NL*
right
,
too
.
You
're
right
,
you
're
right
.
These
are
special
cases
,
I
*NL*
admit
.
But
you
must
observe
this
,
my
dear
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
the
*NL*
general
case
,
the
case
for
which
all
legal
forms
and
rules
are
intended
,
*NL*
for
which
they
are
calculated
and
laid
down
in
books
,
does
not
exist
at
*NL*
all
,
for
the
reason
that
every
case
,
every
crime
,
for
instance
,
so
soon
*NL*
as
it
actually
occurs
,
at
once
becomes
a
thoroughly
special
case
and
*NL*
sometimes
a
case
unlike
any
that
's
gone
before
.
Very
comic
cases
of
that
*NL*
sort
sometimes
occur
.
If
I
leave
one
man
quite
alone
,
if
I
do
n't
touch
*NL*
him
and
do
n't
worry
him
,
but
let
him
know
or
at
least
suspect
every
*NL*
moment
that
I
know
all
about
it
and
am
watching
him
day
and
night
,
and
*NL*
if
he
is
in
continual
suspicion
and
terror
,
he
'll
be
bound
to
lose
his
*NL*
head
.
He
'll
come
of
himself
,
or
maybe
do
something
which
will
make
it
as
*NL*
plain
as
twice
two
are
four
--
it
's
delightful
.
It
may
be
so
with
a
simple
*NL*
peasant
,
but
with
one
of
our
sort
,
an
intelligent
man
cultivated
on
a
*NL*
certain
side
,
it
's
a
dead
certainty
.
For
,
my
dear
fellow
,
it
's
a
very
*NL*
important
matter
to
know
on
what
side
a
man
is
cultivated
.
And
then
*NL*
there
are
nerves
,
there
are
nerves
,
you
have
overlooked
them
!
Why
,
they
*NL*
are
all
sick
,
nervous
and
irritable
!
...
And
then
how
they
all
suffer
*NL*
from
spleen
!
That
I
assure
you
is
a
regular
gold-mine
for
us
.
And
it
's
*NL*
no
anxiety
to
me
,
his
running
about
the
town
free
!
Let
him
,
let
him
walk
*NL*
about
for
a
bit
!
I
know
well
enough
that
I
've
caught
him
and
that
he
*NL*
wo
n't
escape
me
.
Where
could
he
escape
to
,
he-he
?
Abroad
,
perhaps
?
A
*NL*
Pole
will
escape
abroad
,
but
not
here
,
especially
as
I
am
watching
*NL*
and
have
taken
measures
.
Will
he
escape
into
the
depths
of
the
country
*NL*
perhaps
?
But
you
know
,
peasants
live
there
,
real
rude
Russian
peasants
.
*NL*
A
modern
cultivated
man
would
prefer
prison
to
living
with
such
*NL*
strangers
as
our
peasants
.
He-he
!
But
that
's
all
nonsense
,
and
on
*NL*
the
surface
.
It
's
not
merely
that
he
has
nowhere
to
run
to
,
he
is
*NL*
_
psychologically
_
unable
to
escape
me
,
he-he
!
What
an
expression
!
*NL*
Through
a
law
of
nature
he
ca
n't
escape
me
if
he
had
anywhere
to
go
.
*NL*
Have
you
seen
a
butterfly
round
a
candle
?
That
's
how
he
will
keep
*NL*
circling
and
circling
round
me
.
Freedom
will
lose
its
attractions
.
He
'll
*NL*
begin
to
brood
,
he
'll
weave
a
tangle
round
himself
,
he
'll
worry
himself
*NL*
to
death
!
What
's
more
he
will
provide
me
with
a
mathematical
proof
--
if
I
*NL*
only
give
him
long
enough
interval
...
And
he
'll
keep
circling
round
*NL*
me
,
getting
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
--
flop
!
He
'll
fly
straight
into
my
*NL*
mouth
and
I
'll
swallow
him
,
and
that
will
be
very
amusing
,
he-he-he
!
You
*NL*
do
n't
believe
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
made
no
reply
;
he
sat
pale
and
motionless
,
still
gazing
with
*NL*
the
same
intensity
into
Porfiry
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lesson
,
''
he
thought
,
turning
cold
.
``
This
is
beyond
the
cat
*NL*
playing
with
a
mouse
,
like
yesterday
.
He
ca
n't
be
showing
off
his
power
*NL*
with
no
motive
...
prompting
me
;
he
is
far
too
clever
for
that
...
he
must
*NL*
have
another
object
.
What
is
it
?
It
's
all
nonsense
,
my
friend
,
you
are
*NL*
pretending
,
to
scare
me
!
You
've
no
proofs
and
the
man
I
saw
had
no
*NL*
real
existence
.
You
simply
want
to
make
me
lose
my
head
,
to
work
me
up
*NL*
beforehand
and
so
to
crush
me
.
But
you
are
wrong
,
you
wo
n't
do
it
!
But
*NL*
why
give
me
such
a
hint
?
Is
he
reckoning
on
my
shattered
nerves
?
No
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
you
are
wrong
,
you
wo
n't
do
it
even
though
you
have
some
trap
*NL*
for
me
...
let
us
see
what
you
have
in
store
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
braced
himself
to
face
a
terrible
and
unknown
ordeal
.
At
times
*NL*
he
longed
to
fall
on
Porfiry
and
strangle
him
.
This
anger
was
what
he
*NL*
dreaded
from
the
beginning
.
He
felt
that
his
parched
lips
were
flecked
*NL*
with
foam
,
his
heart
was
throbbing
.
But
he
was
still
determined
not
to
*NL*
speak
till
the
right
moment
.
He
realised
that
this
was
the
best
*NL*
policy
in
his
position
,
because
instead
of
saying
too
much
he
would
be
*NL*
irritating
his
enemy
by
his
silence
and
provoking
him
into
speaking
too
*NL*
freely
.
Anyhow
,
this
was
what
he
hoped
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
see
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
you
think
I
am
playing
a
harmless
joke
*NL*
on
you
,
''
Porfiry
began
again
,
getting
more
and
more
lively
,
chuckling
*NL*
at
every
instant
and
again
pacing
round
the
room
.
``
And
to
be
sure
you
're
*NL*
right
:
God
has
given
me
a
figure
that
can
awaken
none
but
comic
ideas
in
*NL*
other
people
;
a
buffoon
;
but
let
me
tell
you
,
and
I
repeat
it
,
excuse
*NL*
an
old
man
,
my
dear
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
you
are
a
man
still
young
,
so
to
*NL*
say
,
in
your
first
youth
and
so
you
put
intellect
above
everything
,
like
*NL*
all
young
people
.
Playful
wit
and
abstract
arguments
fascinate
you
and
*NL*
that
's
for
all
the
world
like
the
old
Austrian
_
Hof-kriegsrath
_
,
as
*NL*
far
as
I
can
judge
of
military
matters
,
that
is
:
on
paper
they
'd
beaten
*NL*
Napoleon
and
taken
him
prisoner
,
and
there
in
their
study
they
worked
it
*NL*
all
out
in
the
cleverest
fashion
,
but
look
you
,
General
Mack
surrendered
*NL*
with
all
his
army
,
he-he-he
!
I
see
,
I
see
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
you
are
*NL*
laughing
at
a
civilian
like
me
,
taking
examples
out
of
military
history
!
*NL*
But
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
it
's
my
weakness
.
I
am
fond
of
military
science
.
*NL*
And
I
'm
ever
so
fond
of
reading
all
military
histories
.
I
've
certainly
*NL*
missed
my
proper
career
.
I
ought
to
have
been
in
the
army
,
upon
my
*NL*
word
I
ought
.
I
should
n't
have
been
a
Napoleon
,
but
I
might
have
been
a
*NL*
major
,
he-he
!
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
whole
truth
,
my
dear
fellow
,
about
*NL*
this
_
special
case
_
,
I
mean
:
actual
fact
and
a
man
's
temperament
,
my
*NL*
dear
sir
,
are
weighty
matters
and
it
's
astonishing
how
they
sometimes
*NL*
deceive
the
sharpest
calculation
!
I
--
listen
to
an
old
man
--
am
speaking
*NL*
seriously
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
''
-LRB-
as
he
said
this
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
who
*NL*
was
scarcely
five-and-thirty
,
actually
seemed
to
have
grown
old
;
even
*NL*
his
voice
changed
and
he
seemed
to
shrink
together
-RRB-
``
Moreover
,
I
'm
*NL*
a
candid
man
...
am
I
a
candid
man
or
not
?
What
do
you
say
?
I
fancy
I
*NL*
really
am
:
I
tell
you
these
things
for
nothing
and
do
n't
even
expect
a
*NL*
reward
for
it
,
he-he
!
Well
,
to
proceed
,
wit
in
my
opinion
is
a
splendid
*NL*
thing
,
it
is
,
so
to
say
,
an
adornment
of
nature
and
a
consolation
of
*NL*
life
,
and
what
tricks
it
can
play
!
So
that
it
sometimes
is
hard
for
a
*NL*
poor
examining
lawyer
to
know
where
he
is
,
especially
when
he
's
liable
*NL*
to
be
carried
away
by
his
own
fancy
,
too
,
for
you
know
he
is
a
man
after
*NL*
all
!
But
the
poor
fellow
is
saved
by
the
criminal
's
temperament
,
worse
*NL*
luck
for
him
!
But
young
people
carried
away
by
their
own
wit
do
n't
think
*NL*
of
that
`
when
they
overstep
all
obstacles
,
'
as
you
wittily
and
cleverly
*NL*
expressed
it
yesterday
.
He
will
lie
--
that
is
,
the
man
who
is
a
_
special
*NL*
case
_
,
the
incognito
,
and
he
will
lie
well
,
in
the
cleverest
fashion
;
*NL*
you
might
think
he
would
triumph
and
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
wit
,
but
at
*NL*
the
most
interesting
,
the
most
flagrant
moment
he
will
faint
.
Of
course
*NL*
there
may
be
illness
and
a
stuffy
room
as
well
,
but
anyway
!
Anyway
he
's
*NL*
given
us
the
idea
!
He
lied
incomparably
,
but
he
did
n't
reckon
on
his
*NL*
temperament
.
That
's
what
betrays
him
!
Another
time
he
will
be
carried
*NL*
away
by
his
playful
wit
into
making
fun
of
the
man
who
suspects
him
,
he
*NL*
will
turn
pale
as
it
were
on
purpose
to
mislead
,
but
his
paleness
will
*NL*
be
_
too
natural
_
,
too
much
like
the
real
thing
,
again
he
has
given
us
*NL*
an
idea
!
Though
his
questioner
may
be
deceived
at
first
,
he
will
think
*NL*
differently
next
day
if
he
is
not
a
fool
,
and
,
of
course
,
it
is
like
*NL*
that
at
every
step
!
He
puts
himself
forward
where
he
is
not
wanted
,
*NL*
speaks
continually
when
he
ought
to
keep
silent
,
brings
in
all
sorts
of
*NL*
allegorical
allusions
,
he-he
!
Comes
and
asks
why
did
n't
you
take
me
long
*NL*
ago
?
he-he-he
!
And
that
can
happen
,
you
know
,
with
the
cleverest
man
,
*NL*
the
psychologist
,
the
literary
man
.
The
temperament
reflects
everything
*NL*
like
a
mirror
!
Gaze
into
it
and
admire
what
you
see
!
But
why
are
you
so
*NL*
pale
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
?
Is
the
room
stuffy
?
Shall
I
open
the
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
trouble
,
please
,
''
cried
Raskolnikov
and
he
suddenly
broke
*NL*
into
a
laugh
.
``
Please
do
n't
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
stood
facing
him
,
paused
a
moment
and
suddenly
he
too
laughed
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
got
up
from
the
sofa
,
abruptly
checking
his
hysterical
*NL*
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
''
he
began
,
speaking
loudly
and
distinctly
,
though
*NL*
his
legs
trembled
and
he
could
scarcely
stand
.
``
I
see
clearly
at
last
*NL*
that
you
actually
suspect
me
of
murdering
that
old
woman
and
her
sister
*NL*
Lizaveta
.
Let
me
tell
you
for
my
part
that
I
am
sick
of
this
.
If
you
*NL*
find
that
you
have
a
right
to
prosecute
me
legally
,
to
arrest
me
,
then
*NL*
prosecute
me
,
arrest
me
.
But
I
will
not
let
myself
be
jeered
at
to
my
*NL*
face
and
worried
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
lips
trembled
,
his
eyes
glowed
with
fury
and
he
could
not
restrain
*NL*
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
allow
it
!
''
he
shouted
,
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
hear
that
,
Porfiry
Petrovitch
?
I
wo
n't
allow
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
What
does
it
mean
?

cried
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
apparently
*NL*
quite
frightened
.
``
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
my
dear
fellow
,
what
is
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Raskolnikov
shouted
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
my

man
!
They
'll
hear
and
come
in

Just
think
,
what
could
we
*NL*
say
to
them
?

Porfiry
Petrovitch
whispered
in
horror
,
bringing
his
face
*NL*
close
to
Raskolnikov
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
allow
it
,
I
wo
n't
allow
it

''
Raskolnikov
repeated
mechanically
,
*NL*
but
he
too
spoke
in
a
sudden
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
turned
quickly
and
ran
to
open
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
fresh
air
!
And
you
must
have
some
water
,
my
dear
fellow
.
You
're
*NL*
ill
!
''
and
he
was
running
to
the
door
to
call
for
some
when
he
found
a
*NL*
decanter
of
water
in
the
corner
.
``
Come
,
drink
a
little
,
''
he
whispered
,
*NL*
rushing
up
to
him
with
the
decanter
.
``
It
will
be
sure
to
do
you
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
's
alarm
and
sympathy
were
so
natural
that
Raskolnikov
*NL*
was
silent
and
began
looking
at
him
with
wild
curiosity
.
He
did
not
take
*NL*
the
water
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
my
dear
fellow
,
you
'll
drive
yourself
out
of
your
*NL*
mind

I
assure
you
,
ach

ach
!
Have
some
water
,
do
drink
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
forced
him
to
take
the
glass
.
Raskolnikov
raised
it
mechanically
to
*NL*
his
lips
,
but
set
it
on
the
table
again
with
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
've
had
a
little
attack
!
You
'll
bring
back
your
illness
again

*NL*
my

fellow

''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
cackled
with
friendly
sympathy
,
*NL*
though
he
still
looked
rather
disconcerted
.
``
Good
heavens
,
you
must
*NL*
take
more
care

!
Dmitri
Prokofitch
was
here
,
came
to

me

yesterday

I

I

I
've
a
nasty

ironical
temper

what
they
*NL*
made
of
it
!
...
Good
heavens
,
he
came
yesterday
after
you
'd
been
.
We
*NL*
dined
and
he
talked
and
talked
away
,
and
I
could
only
throw
up
my
hands
*NL*
in
despair
!
Did
he
come
from
you
?
But
do
sit
down
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
sit
*NL*
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
from
me
,
but
I
knew
he
went
to
you
and
why
he
went

*NL*
Raskolnikov
answered
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew

What
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
this
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
that
I
know
more
than
that
about
you
;
*NL*
I
know
about
everything
.
I
know
how
you
went
_
to
take
a
flat
_
at
night
*NL*
when
it
was
dark
and
how
you
rang
the
bell
and
asked
about
the
blood
,
so
*NL*
that
the
workmen
and
the
porter
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
Yes
,
I
*NL*
understand
your
state
of
mind
at
that
time
...
but
you
'll
drive
yourself
*NL*
mad
like
that
,
upon
my
word
!
You
'll
lose
your
head
!
You
're
full
of
*NL*
generous
indignation
at
the
wrongs
you
've
received
,
first
from
destiny
,
*NL*
and
then
from
the
police
officers
,
and
so
you
rush
from
one
thing
to
*NL*
another
to
force
them
to
speak
out
and
make
an
end
of
it
all
,
because
*NL*
you
are
sick
of
all
this
suspicion
and
foolishness
.
That
's
so
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
I
have
guessed
how
you
feel
,
have
n't
I
?
Only
in
that
way
you
'll
*NL*
lose
your
head
and
Razumihin
's
,
too
;
he
's
too
_
good
_
a
man
for
such
*NL*
a
position
,
you
must
know
that
.
You
are
ill
and
he
is
good
and
your
*NL*
illness
is
infectious
for
him

I
'll
tell
you
about
it
when
you
are
*NL*
more
yourself
...
But
do
sit
down
,
for
goodness

Please
rest
,
you
*NL*
look
shocking

do
sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
sat
down
;
he
no
longer
shivered
,
he
was
hot
all
over
.
In
*NL*
amazement
he
listened
with
strained
attention
to
Porfiry
Petrovitch
who
*NL*
still
seemed
frightened
as
he
looked
after
him
with
friendly
solicitude
.
*NL*
But
he
did
not
believe
a
word
he
said
,
though
he
felt
a
strange
*NL*
inclination
to
believe
.
Porfiry
's
unexpected
words
about
the
flat
had
*NL*
utterly
overwhelmed
him
.
``
How
can
it
be
,
he
knows
about
the
flat
then
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
suddenly
,
``
and
he
tells
it
me
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
our
legal
practice
there
was
a
case
almost
exactly
similar
,
a
*NL*
case
of
morbid
psychology

''
Porfiry
went
on
quickly
.
``
A
man
confessed
to
*NL*
murder
and
how
he
kept
it
up
!
It
was
a
regular
hallucination
;
he
brought
*NL*
forward
facts
,
he
imposed
upon
everyone
and
why
?
He
had
been
partly
,
but
*NL*
only
partly
,
unintentionally
the
cause
of
a
murder
and
when
he
knew
that
*NL*
he
had
given
the
murderers
the
opportunity
,
he
sank
into
dejection
,
it
*NL*
got
on
his
mind
and
turned
his
brain
,
he
began
imagining
things
and
he
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
the
murderer
.
But
at
last
the
High
Court
*NL*
of
Appeal
went
into
it
and
the
poor
fellow
was
acquitted
and
put
under
*NL*
proper
care
.
Thanks
to
the
Court
of
Appeal
!
Tut-tut-tut
!
Why
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow
,
you
may
drive
yourself
into
delirium
if
you
have
the
impulse
*NL*
to
work
upon
your
nerves
,
to
go
ringing
bells
at
night
and
asking
about
*NL*
blood
!
I
've
studied
all
this
morbid
psychology
in
my
practice
.
A
man
*NL*
is
sometimes
tempted
to
jump
out
of
a
window
or
from
a
belfry
.
Just
the
*NL*
same
with
bell-ringing
...
It
's
all
illness
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
!
You
*NL*
have
begun
to
neglect
your
illness
.
You
should
consult
an
experienced
*NL*
doctor
,
what
's
the
good
of
that
fat
fellow
?
You
are
lightheaded
!
You
*NL*
were
delirious
when
you
did
all
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Raskolnikov
felt
everything
going
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
is
it
possible
,
''
flashed
through
his
mind
,
``
that
he
is
*NL*
still
lying
?
He
ca
n't
be
,
he
ca
n't
be
.
''
He
rejected
that
idea
,
feeling
*NL*
to
what
a
degree
of
fury
it
might
drive
him
,
feeling
that
that
fury
*NL*
might
drive
him
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
delirious
.
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
,
''
he
cried
,
straining
*NL*
every
faculty
to
penetrate
Porfiry
's
game
,
``
I
was
quite
myself
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
hear
and
understand

You
said
yesterday
you
were
not
delirious

*NL*
you
were
particularly
emphatic
about
it

I
understand
all
you
can
tell

A-ach

Listen
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
my
dear
fellow

If
you
were
*NL*
actually
a
criminal
,
or
were
somehow
mixed
up
in
this
damnable
business
,
*NL*
would
you
insist
that
you
were
not
delirious
but
in
full
possession
*NL*
of
your
faculties
?
And
so
emphatically
and
persistently
?
Would
it
be
*NL*
possible
?
Quite
impossible
,
to
my
thinking
.
If
you
had
anything
on
*NL*
your
conscience
,
you
certainly
ought
to
insist
that
you
were
delirious
.
*NL*
That
's
so
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
note
of
slyness
in
this
inquiry
.
Raskolnikov
drew
back
on
*NL*
the
sofa
as
Porfiry
bent
over
him
and
stared
in
silent
perplexity
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
thing
about
Razumihin
--
you
certainly
ought
to
have
said
that
he
*NL*
came
of
his
own
accord

to
have
concealed
your
part
in
it
!
But
you
do
n't
*NL*
conceal
it
!
You
lay
stress
on
his
coming
at
your
instigation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
not
done
so
.
A
chill
went
down
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
keep
telling
lies
,
''
he
said
slowly
and
weakly
,
twisting
his
lips
*NL*
into
a
sickly
smile
,
``
you
are
trying
again
to
show
that
you
know
all
*NL*
my
game
,
that
you
know
all
I
shall
say
beforehand
,
''
he
said
,
conscious
*NL*
himself
that
he
was
not
weighing
his
words
as
he
ought
.
``
You
want
to
*NL*
frighten
me

or
you
are
simply
laughing
at
me

*NL*
*NL*
He
still
stared
at
him
as
he
said
this
and
again
there
was
a
light
of
*NL*
intense
hatred
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
keep
lying
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
know
perfectly
well
that
the
best
*NL*
policy
for
the
criminal
is
to
tell
the
truth
as
nearly

to

conceal
as
little
as
possible

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
wily
person
you
are

Porfiry
tittered
,
``
there
's
no
catching

you

So
you
do

But
still
you

do
believe

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
lips
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

went
on
Porfiry

touching
Raskolnikov

arm
genially
,
``

like
that
,
a
real
fact
-LRB-
for
it
is
a
fact
worth
having
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
you
see
nothing
in
it
!
Why
,
if
I
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
you
,
*NL*
should
I
have
acted
like
that
?
No
,
I
should
first
have
disarmed
your
*NL*
suspicions
and
not
let
you
see
I
knew
of
that
fact
,
should
have
diverted
*NL*
your
attention
and
suddenly
have
dealt
you
a
knock-down
blow
-LRB-
your
*NL*
expression
-RRB-
saying
:
`
And
what
were
you
doing
,
sir
,
pray
,
at
ten
or
*NL*
nearly
eleven
at
the
murdered
woman
's
flat
and
why
did
you
ring
the
bell
*NL*
and
why
did
you
ask
about
blood
?
And
why
did
you
invite
the
porters
*NL*
to
go
with
you
to
the
police
station
,
to
the
lieutenant
?
'
That
's
how
*NL*
I
ought
to
have
acted
if
I
had
a
grain
of
suspicion
of
you
.
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
taken
your
evidence
in
due
form
,
searched
your
lodging
and
perhaps
*NL*
have
arrested
you
,
too
...
so
I
have
no
suspicion
of
you
,
since
I
have
*NL*
not
done
that
!
But
you
ca
n't
look
at
it
normally
and
you
see
nothing
,
I
*NL*
say
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
started
so
that
Porfiry
Petrovitch
could
not
fail
to
*NL*
perceive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lying
all
the
while
,
''
he
cried
,
``
I
do
n't
know
your
object
,
*NL*
but
you
are
lying
.
You
did
not
speak
like
that
just
now
and
I
can
not
be
*NL*
mistaken
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lying
?
''
Porfiry
repeated
,
apparently
incensed
,
but
preserving
*NL*
a
good-humoured
and
ironical
face
,
as
though
he
were
not
in
the
least
*NL*
concerned
at
Raskolnikov
's
opinion
of
him
.
``
I
am
lying
...
but
how
did
*NL*
I
treat
you
just
now
,
I
,
the
examining
lawyer
?
Prompting
you
and
giving
*NL*
you
every
means
for
your
defence
;
illness
,
I
said
,
delirium
,
injury
,
*NL*
melancholy
and
the
police
officers
and
all
the
rest
of
it
?
Ah
!
He-he-he
!
*NL*
Though
,
indeed
,
all
those
psychological
means
of
defence
are
not
very
*NL*
reliable
and
cut
both
ways
:
illness
,
delirium
,
I
do
n't
remember
--
that
's
*NL*
all
right
,
but
why
,
my
good
sir
,
in
your
illness
and
in
your
delirium
*NL*
were
you
haunted
by
just
those
delusions
and
not
by
any
others

There
*NL*
may
have
been
others
,
eh
?
He-he-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
haughtily
and
contemptuously
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Briefly
,
''
he
said
loudly
and
imperiously
,
rising
to
his
feet
and
in
so
*NL*
doing
pushing
Porfiry
back
a
little
,
``
briefly
,
I
want
to
know

do
you

me
perfectly
free
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

I
'm
having
with
you

cried
Porfiry
with
a
perfectly
*NL*
good-humoured
,
sly
and
composed
face
.
``
And
why
do
you
want
to
know
,
why
*NL*
do
you
want
to
know
so
much
,
since
they

n't
begun
to
worry
you
?
Why
,
*NL*
you
are
like
a
child
asking
for
matches
!
And
why
are
you
so
uneasy
?
Why
*NL*
do
you
force
yourself
upon
us

eh

He-he-he
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
,

Raskolnikov
cried
furiously
,
``
that
I
ca
n't
put
up
with
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what

interrupted
Porfiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
jeer
at

he
shouted
,
bringing
his
fist
*NL*
down
on
the
table
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

Hush

They
'll
overhear

I
warn
you
seriously
,
take
care
of
*NL*
yourself

I
am
not
joking

''
Porfiry
whispered
,
but
this
time
there
was
*NL*
not
the
look
of
old
womanish
good
nature
and
alarm
in
his
face
.
Now
*NL*
he
was
peremptory
,
stern
,
frowning
and
for
once
laying
aside
all
*NL*
mystification
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
only
for
an
instant
.
Raskolnikov
,
bewildered
,
suddenly
fell
*NL*
into
actual
frenzy
,
but
,
strange
to
say
,
he
again
obeyed
the
command
to
*NL*
speak
quietly
,
though
he
was
in
a
perfect
paroxysm
of
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
allow
myself
to
be
tortured
,
''
he
whispered
,
instantly
*NL*
recognising
with
hatred
that
he
could
not
help
obeying
the
command
and
*NL*
driven
to
even
greater
fury
by
the
thought
.
``
Arrest
me
,
search
me
,
but
*NL*
kindly
act
in
due
form

do
n't
play
with

Do
n't
dare
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
about
the
form

''
Porfiry
interrupted
with
the
same
sly
*NL*
smile
,
as
it
were
,
gloating
with
enjoyment
over
Raskolnikov
.
``
I
invited
*NL*
you
to
see
me
quite
in
a
friendly
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want

I
spit
on

Do
you
hear

And
,
here
,
*NL*
I
take
my
cap
and
go
.
What
will
you
say
now
if
you
mean
to
arrest
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
cap
and
went
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wo
n't
you
see
my
little
surprise
?
''
chuckled
Porfiry
,
again
taking
*NL*
him
by
the
arm
and
stopping
him
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
become
more
playful
and
good-humoured
which
maddened
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
surprise
?
''
he
asked
,
standing
still
and
looking
at
Porfiry
in
*NL*
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
surprise
,
it
's
sitting
there
behind
the
door
,
he-he-he
!
''
*NL*
-LRB-
He
pointed
to
the
locked
door
.
-RRB-
``
I
locked
him
in
that
he
should
not
*NL*
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
Where
?
What
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
to
the
door
and
would
have
opened
it
,
but
it
was
*NL*
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
locked
,
here
is
the
key
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
brought
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lying
,
''
roared
Raskolnikov
without
restraint
,
``
you
lie
,
you
*NL*
damned
punchinello
!
''
and
he
rushed
at
Porfiry
who
retreated
to
the
other
*NL*
door
,
not
at
all
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
it
all
!
You
are
lying
and
mocking
so
that
I
may
betray
*NL*
myself
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
could
not
betray
yourself
any
further

dear
Rodion

Romanovitch

passion

Do
n't

shall
call

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lying

You
knew

was
ill
and
tried
to
work

me
into
a
frenzy
to
make
me
betray
myself

that
was
your
object

Produce
*NL*
your
facts

I
understand
it
all

only

wretched
rubbishly
suspicions

drive

to
fury

down

my
good
man

things

will
imagine

do

not

acting
in
form

say

do
n't
know
the

my
dear
fellow

And
there
's
no
escaping

Porfiry
*NL*
muttered
,
listening
at
the
door
through
which
a
noise
could
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
they
're
coming
,
''
cried
Raskolnikov
.
``
You
've
sent
for
them

You
*NL*
expected

Well
,
produce
them
all

your

your
witnesses

*NL*
what
you
like

I
am
ready

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
moment
a
strange
incident
occurred
,
something
so
unexpected
*NL*
that
neither
Raskolnikov
nor
Porfiry
Petrovitch
could
have
looked
for
*NL*
such
a
conclusion
to
their
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
remembered
the
scene
afterwards
,
this
is
how
Raskolnikov
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
behind
the
door
increased
,
and
suddenly
the
door
was
opened
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
annoyed
.
``
Why
,
I
gave
orders
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
there
was
no
answer
,
but
it
was
evident
that
there
were
*NL*
several
persons
at
the
door
,
and
that
they
were
apparently
pushing
*NL*
somebody
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
repeated
,
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prisoner
Nikolay
has
been
brought
,
''
someone
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
wanted
!
Take
him
away
!
Let
him
wait
!
What
's
he
doing
here
?
*NL*
How
irregular
!
''
cried
Porfiry
,
rushing
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
...
''
began
the
same
voice
,
and
suddenly
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
seconds
,
not
more
,
were
spent
in
actual
struggle
,
then
someone
gave
*NL*
a
violent
shove
,
and
then
a
man
,
very
pale
,
strode
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
's
appearance
was
at
first
sight
very
strange
.
He
stared
*NL*
straight
before
him
,
as
though
seeing
nothing
.
There
was
a
determined
*NL*
gleam
in
his
eyes
;
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
deathly
pallor
in
his
*NL*
face
,
as
though
he
were
being
led
to
the
scaffold
.
His
white
lips
were
*NL*
faintly
twitching
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dressed
like
a
workman
and
was
of
medium
height
,
very
young
,
*NL*
slim
,
his
hair
cut
in
round
crop
,
with
thin
spare
features
.
The
man
whom
*NL*
he
had
thrust
back
followed
him
into
the
room
and
succeeded
in
seizing
*NL*
him
by
the
shoulder
;
he
was
a
warder
;
but
Nikolay
pulled
his
arm
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
persons
crowded
inquisitively
into
the
doorway
.
Some
of
them
*NL*
tried
to
get
in
.
All
this
took
place
almost
instantaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
it
's
too
soon
!
Wait
till
you
are
sent
for
!
...
Why
have
you
*NL*
brought
him
so
soon
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
muttered
,
extremely
annoyed
,
*NL*
and
as
it
were
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Nikolay
suddenly
knelt
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
cried
Porfiry
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
guilty
!
Mine
is
the
sin
!
I
am
the
murderer
,
''
Nikolay
articulated
*NL*
suddenly
,
rather
breathless
,
but
speaking
fairly
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
ten
seconds
there
was
silence
as
though
all
had
been
struck
dumb
;
*NL*
even
the
warder
stepped
back
,
mechanically
retreated
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
stood
immovable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
recovering
from
his
momentary
*NL*
stupefaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
am
the
murderer
,
''
repeated
Nikolay
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
...
you
...
what
...
whom
did
you
kill
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
was
*NL*
obviously
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
again
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alyona
Ivanovna
and
her
sister
Lizaveta
Ivanovna
,
I.
.
.
killed
...
with
*NL*
an
axe
.
Darkness
came
over
me
,
''
he
added
suddenly
,
and
was
again
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
remained
on
his
knees
.
Porfiry
Petrovitch
stood
for
some
*NL*
moments
as
though
meditating
,
but
suddenly
roused
himself
and
waved
back
*NL*
the
uninvited
spectators
.
They
instantly
vanished
and
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
Then
he
looked
towards
Raskolnikov
,
who
was
standing
in
the
corner
,
*NL*
staring
wildly
at
Nikolay
and
moved
towards
him
,
but
stopped
short
,
*NL*
looked
from
Nikolay
to
Raskolnikov
and
then
again
at
Nikolay
,
and
*NL*
seeming
unable
to
restrain
himself
darted
at
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
too
great
a
hurry
,
''
he
shouted
at
him
,
almost
angrily
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
ask
you
what
came
over
you
...
Speak
,
did
you
kill
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
murderer
...
I
want
to
give
evidence
,
''
Nikolay
pronounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
!
What
did
you
kill
them
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
axe
.
I
had
it
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
he
is
in
a
hurry
!
Alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
did
not
understand
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
do
it
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
alone
.
And
Mitka
is
not
guilty
and
had
no
share
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
about
Mitka
!
A-ach
!
How
was
it
you
ran
downstairs
*NL*
like
that
at
the
time
?
The
porters
met
you
both
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
to
put
them
off
the
scent
...
I
ran
after
Mitka
,
''
Nikolay
replied
*NL*
hurriedly
,
as
though
he
had
prepared
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
!
''
cried
Porfiry
,
with
vexation
.
``
It
's
not
his
own
tale
he
is
*NL*
telling
,
''
he
muttered
as
though
to
himself
,
and
suddenly
his
eyes
rested
*NL*
on
Raskolnikov
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
apparently
so
taken
up
with
Nikolay
that
for
a
moment
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
Raskolnikov
.
He
was
a
little
taken
aback
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
excuse
me
!
''
he
flew
up
to
him
,
``
this
wo
n't
*NL*
do
;
I
'm
afraid
you
must
go
...
it
's
no
good
your
staying
...
I
will
...
*NL*
you
see
,
what
a
surprise
!
...
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
him
by
the
arm
,
he
showed
him
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
did
n't
expect
it
?
''
said
Raskolnikov
who
,
though
he
had
*NL*
not
yet
fully
grasped
the
situation
,
had
regained
his
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
expect
it
either
,
my
friend
.
See
how
your
hand
is
*NL*
trembling
!
He-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
trembling
,
too
,
Porfiry
Petrovitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
;
I
did
n't
expect
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
already
at
the
door
;
Porfiry
was
impatient
for
Raskolnikov
to
*NL*
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
little
surprise
,
are
n't
you
going
to
show
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
said
,
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
his
teeth
are
chattering
as
he
asks
,
he-he
!
You
are
an
ironical
*NL*
person
!
Come
,
till
we
meet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
we
can
say
_
good-bye
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
in
God
's
hands
,
''
muttered
Porfiry
,
with
an
unnatural
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
through
the
office
,
Raskolnikov
noticed
that
many
people
*NL*
were
looking
at
him
.
Among
them
he
saw
the
two
porters
from
_
the
_
house
,
*NL*
whom
he
had
invited
that
night
to
the
police
station
.
They
stood
there
*NL*
waiting
.
But
he
was
no
sooner
on
the
stairs
than
he
heard
the
voice
of
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
behind
him
.
Turning
round
,
he
saw
the
latter
running
*NL*
after
him
,
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
;
as
to
all
the
rest
,
it
's
in
God
's
hands
,
*NL*
but
as
a
matter
of
form
there
are
some
questions
I
shall
have
to
ask
*NL*
you
...
so
we
shall
meet
again
,
sha
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Porfiry
stood
still
,
facing
him
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
we
?
''
he
added
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
want
to
say
something
more
,
but
could
not
speak
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
forgive
me
,
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
for
what
has
just
passed
...
I
*NL*
lost
my
temper

''
began
Raskolnikov
,
who
had
so
far
regained
his
courage
*NL*
that
he
felt
irresistibly
inclined
to
display
his
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mention
it
,
do
n't
mention
it
,
''
Porfiry
replied
,
almost
gleefully
.
*NL*
``
I
myself
,
too
...
I
have
a
wicked
temper
,
I
admit
it
!
But
we
shall
meet
*NL*
again
.
If
it
's
God
's
will
,
we
may
see
a
great
deal
of
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
get
to
know
each
other
through
and
through
?
''
added
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
know
each
other
through
and
through
,
''
assented
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
*NL*
and
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
looking
earnestly
at
Raskolnikov
.
``
Now
*NL*
you
're
going
to
a
birthday
party
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
funeral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
the
funeral
!
Take
care
of
yourself
,
and
get
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
wish
you
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
who
had
begun
to
*NL*
descend
the
stairs
,
but
looked
back
again
.
``
I
should
like
to
wish
you
*NL*
success
,
but
your
office
is
such
a
comical
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
comical
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
had
turned
to
go
,
but
he
seemed
to
*NL*
prick
up
his
ears
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
you
must
have
been
torturing
and
harassing
that
poor
Nikolay
*NL*
psychologically
,
after
your
fashion
,
till
he
confessed
!
You
must
have
*NL*
been
at
him
day
and
night
,
proving
to
him
that
he
was
the
murderer
,
and
*NL*
now
that
he
has
confessed
,
you
'll
begin
vivisecting
him
again
.
`
You
are
*NL*
lying
,

you
'll
say
.

You
are
not
the
murderer

You
ca
n't
be

It
's
not
*NL*
your
own
tale
you
are
telling
!

You
must
admit
it
's
a
comical
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He-he-he
!
You
noticed
then
that
I
said
to
Nikolay
just
now
that
it
was

was
telling

*NL*
*NL*
``

a

you
always
fasten
on
the
comic
side

he-he

They
say
*NL*
that
was
the
marked
characteristic
of
Gogol
,
among
the
writers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
Gogol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of

...
I
shall
look
forward
to
meeting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
shall
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
straight
home
.
He
was
so
muddled
and
bewildered
that
*NL*
on
getting
home
he
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
sofa
,
trying
to
*NL*
collect
his
thoughts
.
He
did
not
attempt
to
think
about
Nikolay
;
he
*NL*
was
stupefied
;
he
felt
that
his
confession
was
something
inexplicable
,
*NL*
amazing
--
something
beyond
his
understanding
.
But
Nikolay
's
confession
*NL*
was
an
actual
fact
.
The
consequences
of
this
fact
were
clear
to
him
at
*NL*
once
,
its
falsehood
could
not
fail
to
be
discovered
,
and
then
they
*NL*
would
be
after
him
again
.
Till
then
,
at
least
,
he
was
free
and
must
do
*NL*
something
for
himself
,
for
the
danger
was
imminent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
imminent
?
His
position
gradually
became
clear
to
him
.
*NL*
Remembering
,
sketchily
,
the
main
outlines
of
his
recent
scene
with
*NL*
Porfiry
,
he
could
not
help
shuddering
again
with
horror
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
he
did
not
yet
know
all
Porfiry
's
aims
,
he
could
not
see
into
all
his
*NL*
calculations
.
But
he
had
already
partly
shown
his
hand
,
and
no
one
knew
*NL*
better
than
Raskolnikov
how
terrible
Porfiry
's
``
lead
''
had
been
for
*NL*
him
.
A
little
more
and
he
_
might
_
have
given
himself
away
completely
,
*NL*
circumstantially
.
Knowing
his
nervous
temperament
and
from
the
first
*NL*
glance
seeing
through
him
,
Porfiry
,
though
playing
a
bold
game
,
was
*NL*
bound
to
win
.
There
's
no
denying
that
Raskolnikov
had
compromised
*NL*
himself
seriously
,
but
no
_
facts
_
had
come
to
light
as
yet
;
there
was
*NL*
nothing
positive
.
But
was
he
taking
a
true
view
of
the
position
?
Was
n't
*NL*
he
mistaken
?
What
had
Porfiry
been
trying
to
get
at
?
Had
he
really
some
*NL*
surprise
prepared
for
him
?
And
what
was
it
?
Had
he
really
been
expecting
*NL*
something
or
not
?
How
would
they
have
parted
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
*NL*
unexpected
appearance
of
Nikolay
?
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
had
shown
almost
all
his
cards
--
of
course
,
he
had
risked
*NL*
something
in
showing
them
--
and
if
he
had
really
had
anything
up
his
*NL*
sleeve
-LRB-
Raskolnikov
reflected
-RRB-
,
he
would
have
shown
that
,
too
.
What
was
*NL*
that
``
surprise
''
?
Was
it
a
joke
?
Had
it
meant
anything
?
Could
it
have
*NL*
concealed
anything
like
a
fact
,
a
piece
of
positive
evidence
?
His
*NL*
yesterday
's
visitor
?
What
had
become
of
him
?
Where
was
he
to-day
?
If
*NL*
Porfiry
really
had
any
evidence
,
it
must
be
connected
with
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
on
the
sofa
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
face
hidden
in
*NL*
his
hands
.
He
was
still
shivering
nervously
.
At
last
he
got
up
,
took
his
*NL*
cap
,
thought
a
minute
,
and
went
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
for
to-day
,
at
least
,
he
might
*NL*
consider
himself
out
of
danger
.
He
had
a
sudden
sense
almost
of
joy
;
he
*NL*
wanted
to
make
haste
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
.
He
would
be
too
late
for
*NL*
the
funeral
,
of
course
,
but
he
would
be
in
time
for
the
memorial
dinner
,
*NL*
and
there
at
once
he
would
see
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
still
,
thought
a
moment
,
and
a
suffering
smile
came
for
a
*NL*
moment
on
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
!
To-day
,
''
he
repeated
to
himself
.
``
Yes
,
to-day
!
So
it
must
*NL*
be
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
he
was
about
to
open
the
door
,
it
began
opening
of
itself
.
He
*NL*
started
and
moved
back
.
The
door
opened
gently
and
slowly
,
and
there
*NL*
suddenly
appeared
a
figure
--
yesterday
's
visitor
_
from
underground
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
stood
in
the
doorway
,
looked
at
Raskolnikov
without
speaking
,
*NL*
and
took
a
step
forward
into
the
room
.
He
was
exactly
the
same
as
*NL*
yesterday
;
the
same
figure
,
the
same
dress
,
but
there
was
a
great
change
*NL*
in
his
face
;
he
looked
dejected
and
sighed
deeply
.
If
he
had
only
put
*NL*
his
hand
up
to
his
cheek
and
leaned
his
head
on
one
side
he
would
have
*NL*
looked
exactly
like
a
peasant
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
asked
Raskolnikov
,
numb
with
terror
.
The
man
was
*NL*
still
silent
,
but
suddenly
he
bowed
down
almost
to
the
ground
,
touching
*NL*
it
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sinned
,
''
the
man
articulated
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
evil
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
vexed
.
When
you
came
,
perhaps
in
drink
,
and
bade
the
porters
go
*NL*
to
the
police
station
and
asked
about
the
blood
,
I
was
vexed
that
they
*NL*
let
you
go
and
took
you
for
drunken
.
I
was
so
vexed
that
I
lost
my
*NL*
sleep
.
And
remembering
the
address
we
came
here
yesterday
and
asked
for
*NL*
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
came
?
''
Raskolnikov
interrupted
,
instantly
beginning
to
recollect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
I
've
wronged
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
come
from
that
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
standing
at
the
gate
with
them
...
do
n't
you
remember
?
We
have
*NL*
carried
on
our
trade
in
that
house
for
years
past
.
We
cure
and
prepare
*NL*
hides
,
we
take
work
home
...
most
of
all
I
was
vexed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
whole
scene
of
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
gateway
came
*NL*
clearly
before
Raskolnikov
's
mind
;
he
recollected
that
there
had
*NL*
been
several
people
there
besides
the
porters
,
women
among
them
.
*NL*
He
remembered
one
voice
had
suggested
taking
him
straight
to
the
*NL*
police-station
.
He
could
not
recall
the
face
of
the
speaker
,
and
even
*NL*
now
he
did
not
recognise
it
,
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
turned
round
*NL*
and
made
him
some
answer
...
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
was
the
solution
of
yesterday
's
horror
.
The
most
awful
thought
*NL*
was
that
he
had
been
actually
almost
lost
,
had
almost
done
for
himself
*NL*
on
account
of
such
a
_
trivial
_
circumstance
.
So
this
man
could
tell
*NL*
nothing
except
his
asking
about
the
flat
and
the
blood
stains
.
So
*NL*
Porfiry
,
too
,
had
nothing
but
that
_
delirium
_
,
no
facts
but
this
*NL*
_
psychology
_
which
_
cuts
both
ways
_
,
nothing
positive
.
So
if
no
more
*NL*
facts
come
to
light
-LRB-
and
they
must
not
,
they
must
not
!
-RRB-
then
...
then
*NL*
what
can
they
do
to
him
?
How
can
they
convict
him
,
even
if
they
arrest
*NL*
him
?
And
Porfiry
then
had
only
just
heard
about
the
flat
and
had
not
*NL*
known
about
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
you
who
told
Porfiry
...
that
I
'd
been
there
?
''
he
cried
,
struck
*NL*
by
a
sudden
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Porfiry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
head
of
the
detective
department
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
The
porters
did
not
go
there
,
but
I
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
there
two
minutes
before
you
.
And
I
heard
,
I
heard
it
all
,
how
he
*NL*
worried
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
What
?
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
in
the
next
room
.
I
was
sitting
there
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Why
,
then
you
were
the
surprise
?
But
how
could
it
happen
?
Upon
my
*NL*
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
that
the
porters
did
not
want
to
do
what
I
said
,
''
began
the
man
;
*NL*
``
for
it
's
too
late
,
said
they
,
and
maybe
he
'll
be
angry
that
we
did
not
*NL*
come
at
the
time
.
I
was
vexed
and
I
lost
my
sleep
,
and
I
began
making
*NL*
inquiries
.
And
finding
out
yesterday
where
to
go
,
I
went
to-day
.
The
*NL*
first
time
I
went
he
was
n't
there
,
when
I
came
an
hour
later
he
could
n't
*NL*
see
me
.
I
went
the
third
time
,
and
they
showed
me
in
.
I
informed
him
of
*NL*
everything
,
just
as
it
happened
,
and
he
began
skipping
about
the
room
*NL*
and
punching
himself
on
the
chest
.
`
What
do
you
scoundrels
mean
by
it
?
*NL*
If
I
'd
known
about
it
I
should
have
arrested
him
!
'
Then
he
ran
out
,
*NL*
called
somebody
and
began
talking
to
him
in
the
corner
,
then
he
turned
*NL*
to
me
,
scolding
and
questioning
me
.
He
scolded
me
a
great
deal
;
and
I
*NL*
told
him
everything
,
and
I
told
him
that
you
did
n't
dare
to
say
a
word
*NL*
in
answer
to
me
yesterday
and
that
you
did
n't
recognise
me
.
And
he
*NL*
fell
to
running
about
again
and
kept
hitting
himself
on
the
chest
,
and
*NL*
getting
angry
and
running
about
,
and
when
you
were
announced
he
told
*NL*
me
to
go
into
the
next
room
.
`
Sit
there
a
bit
,
'
he
said
.
`
Do
n't
move
,
*NL*
whatever
you
may
hear
.
'
And
he
set
a
chair
there
for
me
and
locked
*NL*
me
in
.
`
Perhaps
,
'
he
said
,
'
I
may
call
you
.
'
And
when
Nikolay
'd
been
*NL*
brought
he
let
me
out
as
soon
as
you
were
gone
.
'
I
shall
send
for
you
*NL*
again
and
question
you
,
'
he
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
question
Nikolay
while
you
were
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
got
rid
of
me
as
he
did
of
you
,
before
he
spoke
to
Nikolay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
stood
still
,
and
again
suddenly
bowed
down
,
touching
the
ground
*NL*
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
my
evil
thoughts
,
and
my
slander
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
forgive
you
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
said
this
,
the
man
bowed
down
again
,
but
not
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
turned
slowly
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
all
cuts
both
ways
,
now
it
all
cuts
both
ways
,
''
repeated
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
and
he
went
out
more
confident
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
make
a
fight
for
it
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
malicious
smile
,
as
he
*NL*
went
down
the
stairs
.
His
malice
was
aimed
at
himself
;
with
shame
and
*NL*
contempt
he
recollected
his
``
cowardice
.

PART
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
that
followed
the
fateful
interview
with
Dounia
and
*NL*
her
mother
brought
sobering
influences
to
bear
on
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
Intensely
unpleasant
as
it
was
,
he
was
forced
little
by
little
to
accept
*NL*
as
a
fact
beyond
recall
what
had
seemed
to
him
only
the
day
before
*NL*
fantastic
and
incredible
.
The
black
snake
of
wounded
vanity
had
been
*NL*
gnawing
at
his
heart
all
night
.
When
he
got
out
of
bed
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
*NL*
immediately
looked
in
the
looking-glass
.
He
was
afraid
that
he
had
*NL*
jaundice
.
However
his
health
seemed
unimpaired
so
far
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
his
noble
,
clear-skinned
countenance
which
had
grown
fattish
of
*NL*
late
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
for
an
instant
was
positively
comforted
in
the
*NL*
conviction
that
he
would
find
another
bride
and
,
perhaps
,
even
a
better
*NL*
one
.
But
coming
back
to
the
sense
of
his
present
position
,
he
turned
*NL*
aside
and
spat
vigorously
,
which
excited
a
sarcastic
smile
in
Andrey
*NL*
Semyonovitch
Lebeziatnikov
,
the
young
friend
with
whom
he
was
staying
.
*NL*
That
smile
Pyotr
Petrovitch
noticed
,
and
at
once
set
it
down
against
his
*NL*
young
friend
's
account
.
He
had
set
down
a
good
many
points
against
him
*NL*
of
late
.
His
anger
was
redoubled
when
he
reflected
that
he
ought
not
to
*NL*
have
told
Andrey
Semyonovitch
about
the
result
of
yesterday
's
interview
.
*NL*
That
was
the
second
mistake
he
had
made
in
temper
,
through
impulsiveness
*NL*
and
irritability
...
Moreover
,
all
that
morning
one
unpleasantness
*NL*
followed
another
.
He
even
found
a
hitch
awaiting
him
in
his
legal
case
*NL*
in
the
senate
.
He
was
particularly
irritated
by
the
owner
of
the
flat
*NL*
which
had
been
taken
in
view
of
his
approaching
marriage
and
was
being
*NL*
redecorated
at
his
own
expense
;
the
owner
,
a
rich
German
tradesman
,
*NL*
would
not
entertain
the
idea
of
breaking
the
contract
which
had
just
*NL*
been
signed
and
insisted
on
the
full
forfeit
money
,
though
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
would
be
giving
him
back
the
flat
practically
redecorated
.
In
*NL*
the
same
way
the
upholsterers
refused
to
return
a
single
rouble
of
the
*NL*
instalment
paid
for
the
furniture
purchased
but
not
yet
removed
to
the
*NL*
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
get
married
simply
for
the
sake
of
the
furniture
?
''
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
ground
his
teeth
and
at
the
same
time
once
more
he
had
a
*NL*
gleam
of
desperate
hope
.
``
Can
all
that
be
really
so
irrevocably
over
?
*NL*
Is
it
no
use
to
make
another
effort
?
''
The
thought
of
Dounia
sent
a
*NL*
voluptuous
pang
through
his
heart
.
He
endured
anguish
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
and
if
it
had
been
possible
to
slay
Raskolnikov
instantly
by
wishing
it
,
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
would
promptly
have
uttered
the
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
mistake
,
too
,
not
to
have
given
them
money
,
''
he
thought
,
as
*NL*
he
returned
dejectedly
to
Lebeziatnikov
's
room
,
``
and
why
on
earth
was
I
*NL*
such
a
Jew
?
It
was
false
economy
!
I
meant
to
keep
them
without
a
penny
*NL*
so
that
they
should
turn
to
me
as
their
providence
,
and
look
at
them
!
*NL*
foo
!
If
I
'd
spent
some
fifteen
hundred
roubles
on
them
for
the
trousseau
*NL*
and
presents
,
on
knick-knacks
,
dressing-cases
,
jewellery
,
materials
,
and
*NL*
all
that
sort
of
trash
from
Knopp
's
and
the
English
shop
,
my
position
*NL*
would
have
been
better
and
...
stronger
!
They
could
not
have
refused
me
*NL*
so
easily
!
They
are
the
sort
of
people
that
would
feel
bound
to
return
*NL*
money
and
presents
if
they
broke
it
off
;
and
they
would
find
it
hard
to
*NL*
do
it
!
And
their
conscience
would
prick
them
:
how
can
we
dismiss
a
man
*NL*
who
has
hitherto
been
so
generous
and
delicate
?
...
H
'm
!
I
've
made
a
*NL*
blunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
grinding
his
teeth
again
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
called
himself
a
*NL*
fool
--
but
not
aloud
,
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
home
,
twice
as
irritated
and
angry
as
before
.
The
*NL*
preparations
for
the
funeral
dinner
at
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
excited
*NL*
his
curiosity
as
he
passed
.
He
had
heard
about
it
the
day
before
;
he
*NL*
fancied
,
indeed
,
that
he
had
been
invited
,
but
absorbed
in
his
own
cares
*NL*
he
had
paid
no
attention
.
Inquiring
of
Madame
Lippevechsel
who
was
busy
*NL*
laying
the
table
while
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
away
at
the
cemetery
,
he
*NL*
heard
that
the
entertainment
was
to
be
a
great
affair
,
that
all
the
*NL*
lodgers
had
been
invited
,
among
them
some
who
had
not
known
the
dead
*NL*
man
,
that
even
Andrey
Semyonovitch
Lebeziatnikov
was
invited
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
previous
quarrel
with
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
that
he
,
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
*NL*
was
not
only
invited
,
but
was
eagerly
expected
as
he
was
the
most
*NL*
important
of
the
lodgers
.
Amalia
Ivanovna
herself
had
been
invited
with
*NL*
great
ceremony
in
spite
of
the
recent
unpleasantness
,
and
so
she
was
*NL*
very
busy
with
preparations
and
was
taking
a
positive
pleasure
in
them
;
*NL*
she
was
moreover
dressed
up
to
the
nines
,
all
in
new
black
silk
,
and
she
*NL*
was
proud
of
it
.
All
this
suggested
an
idea
to
Pyotr
Petrovitch
and
he
*NL*
went
into
his
room
,
or
rather
Lebeziatnikov
's
,
somewhat
thoughtful
.
He
*NL*
had
learnt
that
Raskolnikov
was
to
be
one
of
the
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andrey
Semyonovitch
had
been
at
home
all
the
morning
.
The
attitude
of
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
to
this
gentleman
was
strange
,
though
perhaps
natural
.
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
despised
and
hated
him
from
the
day
he
came
to
stay
*NL*
with
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
somewhat
afraid
of
him
.
He
*NL*
had
not
come
to
stay
with
him
on
his
arrival
in
Petersburg
simply
from
*NL*
parsimony
,
though
that
had
been
perhaps
his
chief
object
.
He
had
heard
*NL*
of
Andrey
Semyonovitch
,
who
had
once
been
his
ward
,
as
a
leading
young
*NL*
progressive
who
was
taking
an
important
part
in
certain
interesting
*NL*
circles
,
the
doings
of
which
were
a
legend
in
the
provinces
.
It
had
*NL*
impressed
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
These
powerful
omniscient
circles
who
*NL*
despised
everyone
and
showed
everyone
up
had
long
inspired
in
him
a
*NL*
peculiar
but
quite
vague
alarm
.
He
had
not
,
of
course
,
been
able
to
form
*NL*
even
an
approximate
notion
of
what
they
meant
.
He
,
like
everyone
,
had
*NL*
heard
that
there
were
,
especially
in
Petersburg
,
progressives
of
some
*NL*
sort
,
nihilists
and
so
on
,
and
,
like
many
people
,
he
exaggerated
and
*NL*
distorted
the
significance
of
those
words
to
an
absurd
degree
.
What
for
*NL*
many
years
past
he
had
feared
more
than
anything
was
_
being
shown
*NL*
up
_
and
this
was
the
chief
ground
for
his
continual
uneasiness
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
transferring
his
business
to
Petersburg
.
He
was
afraid
of
*NL*
this
as
little
children
are
sometimes
panic-stricken
.
Some
years
before
,
*NL*
when
he
was
just
entering
on
his
own
career
,
he
had
come
upon
two
cases
*NL*
in
which
rather
important
personages
in
the
province
,
patrons
of
his
,
*NL*
had
been
cruelly
shown
up
.
One
instance
had
ended
in
great
scandal
*NL*
for
the
person
attacked
and
the
other
had
very
nearly
ended
in
serious
*NL*
trouble
.
For
this
reason
Pyotr
Petrovitch
intended
to
go
into
the
*NL*
subject
as
soon
as
he
reached
Petersburg
and
,
if
necessary
,
to
*NL*
anticipate
contingencies
by
seeking
the
favour
of
``
our
younger
*NL*
generation
.
''
He
relied
on
Andrey
Semyonovitch
for
this
and
before
*NL*
his
visit
to
Raskolnikov
he
had
succeeded
in
picking
up
some
current
*NL*
phrases
.
He
soon
discovered
that
Andrey
Semyonovitch
was
a
commonplace
*NL*
simpleton
,
but
that
by
no
means
reassured
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
Even
if
he
*NL*
had
been
certain
that
all
the
progressives
were
fools
like
him
,
it
*NL*
would
not
have
allayed
his
uneasiness
.
All
the
doctrines
,
the
ideas
,
the
*NL*
systems
,
with
which
Andrey
Semyonovitch
pestered
him
had
no
interest
for
*NL*
him
.
He
had
his
own
object
--
he
simply
wanted
to
find
out
at
once
what
*NL*
was
happening
_
here
_
.
Had
these
people
any
power
or
not
?
Had
he
anything
*NL*
to
fear
from
them
?
Would
they
expose
any
enterprise
of
his
?
And
what
*NL*
precisely
was
now
the
object
of
their
attacks
?
Could
he
somehow
make
up
*NL*
to
them
and
get
round
them
if
they
really
were
powerful
?
Was
this
the
*NL*
thing
to
do
or
not
?
Could
n't
he
gain
something
through
them
?
In
fact
*NL*
hundreds
of
questions
presented
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andrey
Semyonovitch
was
an
anaemic
,
scrofulous
little
man
,
with
strangely
*NL*
flaxen
mutton-chop
whiskers
of
which
he
was
very
proud
.
He
was
a
clerk
*NL*
and
had
almost
always
something
wrong
with
his
eyes
.
He
was
rather
*NL*
soft-hearted
,
but
self-confident
and
sometimes
extremely
conceited
in
*NL*
speech
,
which
had
an
absurd
effect
,
incongruous
with
his
little
figure
.
*NL*
He
was
one
of
the
lodgers
most
respected
by
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
for
he
did
*NL*
not
get
drunk
and
paid
regularly
for
his
lodgings
.
Andrey
Semyonovitch
*NL*
really
was
rather
stupid
;
he
attached
himself
to
the
cause
of
progress
*NL*
and
``
our
younger
generation
''
from
enthusiasm
.
He
was
one
of
the
numerous
*NL*
and
varied
legion
of
dullards
,
of
half-animate
abortions
,
conceited
,
*NL*
half-educated
coxcombs
,
who
attach
themselves
to
the
idea
most
in
*NL*
fashion
only
to
vulgarise
it
and
who
caricature
every
cause
they
serve
,
*NL*
however
sincerely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Lebeziatnikov
was
so
good-natured
,
he
,
too
,
was
beginning
to
*NL*
dislike
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
This
happened
on
both
sides
unconsciously
.
*NL*
However
simple
Andrey
Semyonovitch
might
be
,
he
began
to
see
that
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
was
duping
him
and
secretly
despising
him
,
and
that
``
he
was
*NL*
not
the
right
sort
of
man
.
''
He
had
tried
expounding
to
him
the
system
of
*NL*
Fourier
and
the
Darwinian
theory
,
but
of
late
Pyotr
Petrovitch
began
to
*NL*
listen
too
sarcastically
and
even
to
be
rude
.
The
fact
was
he
had
begun
*NL*
instinctively
to
guess
that
Lebeziatnikov
was
not
merely
a
commonplace
*NL*
simpleton
,
but
,
perhaps
,
a
liar
,
too
,
and
that
he
had
no
connections
of
*NL*
any
consequence
even
in
his
own
circle
,
but
had
simply
picked
things
up
*NL*
third-hand
;
and
that
very
likely
he
did
not
even
know
much
about
his
own
*NL*
work
of
propaganda
,
for
he
was
in
too
great
a
muddle
.
A
fine
person
he
*NL*
would
be
to
show
anyone
up
!
It
must
be
noted
,
by
the
way
,
that
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
had
during
those
ten
days
eagerly
accepted
the
strangest
*NL*
praise
from
Andrey
Semyonovitch
;
he
had
not
protested
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
when
Andrey
Semyonovitch
belauded
him
for
being
ready
to
contribute
to
*NL*
the
establishment
of
the
new
``
commune
,
''
or
to
abstain
from
christening
*NL*
his
future
children
,
or
to
acquiesce
if
Dounia
were
to
take
a
lover
a
*NL*
month
after
marriage
,
and
so
on
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
so
enjoyed
hearing
*NL*
his
own
praises
that
he
did
not
disdain
even
such
virtues
when
they
were
*NL*
attributed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
had
occasion
that
morning
to
realise
some
*NL*
five-per-cent
bonds
and
now
he
sat
down
to
the
table
and
counted
over
*NL*
bundles
of
notes
.
Andrey
Semyonovitch
who
hardly
ever
had
any
money
*NL*
walked
about
the
room
pretending
to
himself
to
look
at
all
those
bank
*NL*
notes
with
indifference
and
even
contempt
.
Nothing
would
have
convinced
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
that
Andrey
Semyonovitch
could
really
look
on
the
money
*NL*
unmoved
,
and
the
latter
,
on
his
side
,
kept
thinking
bitterly
that
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
was
capable
of
entertaining
such
an
idea
about
him
and
*NL*
was
,
perhaps
,
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
teasing
his
young
friend
by
*NL*
reminding
him
of
his
inferiority
and
the
great
difference
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
him
incredibly
inattentive
and
irritable
,
though
he
,
Andrey
*NL*
Semyonovitch
,
began
enlarging
on
his
favourite
subject
,
the
foundation
*NL*
of
a
new
special
``
commune
.
''
The
brief
remarks
that
dropped
from
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
between
the
clicking
of
the
beads
on
the
reckoning
frame
*NL*
betrayed
unmistakable
and
discourteous
irony
.
But
the
``
humane
''
Andrey
*NL*
Semyonovitch
ascribed
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
ill-humour
to
his
recent
breach
*NL*
with
Dounia
and
he
was
burning
with
impatience
to
discourse
on
that
*NL*
theme
.
He
had
something
progressive
to
say
on
the
subject
which
*NL*
might
console
his
worthy
friend
and
``
could
not
fail
''
to
promote
his
*NL*
development
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
sort
of
festivity
being
prepared
at
that
...
at
the
*NL*
widow
's
,
is
n't
there
?
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
asked
suddenly
,
interrupting
*NL*
Andrey
Semyonovitch
at
the
most
interesting
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
know
?
Why
,
I
was
telling
you
last
night
what
I
think
*NL*
about
all
such
ceremonies
.
And
she
invited
you
too
,
I
heard
.
You
were
*NL*
talking
to
her
yesterday
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
never
have
expected
that
beggarly
fool
would
have
spent
on
*NL*
this
feast
all
the
money
she
got
from
that
other
fool
,
Raskolnikov
.
I
*NL*
was
surprised
just
now
as
I
came
through
at
the
preparations
there
,
the
*NL*
wines
!
Several
people
are
invited
.
It
's
beyond
everything
!
''
continued
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
who
seemed
to
have
some
object
in
pursuing
the
*NL*
conversation
.
``
What
?
You
say
I
am
asked
too
?
When
was
that
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
.
But
I
sha
n't
go
.
Why
should
I
?
I
only
said
a
word
to
her
in
*NL*
passing
yesterday
of
the
possibility
of
her
obtaining
a
year
's
salary
as
*NL*
a
destitute
widow
of
a
government
clerk
.
I
suppose
she
has
invited
me
on
*NL*
that
account
,
has
n't
she
?
He-he-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
intend
to
go
either
,
''
said
Lebeziatnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
,
after
giving
her
a
thrashing
!
You
might
well
*NL*
hesitate
,
he-he

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
thrashed
?
Whom
?
''
cried
Lebeziatnikov
,
flustered
and
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
thrashed
Katerina
Ivanovna
a
month
ago
.
I
heard
so
*NL*
yesterday
...
so
that
's
what
your
convictions
amount
to
...
and
the
woman
*NL*
question
,
too
,
was
n't
quite
sound
,
he-he-he
!
''
and
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
as
*NL*
though
comforted
,
went
back
to
clicking
his
beads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
slander
and
nonsense
!
''
cried
Lebeziatnikov
,
who
was
always
*NL*
afraid
of
allusions
to
the
subject
.
``
It
was
not
like
that
at
all
,
it
*NL*
was
quite
different
.
You
've
heard
it
wrong
;
it
's
a
libel
.
I
was
simply
*NL*
defending
myself
.
She
rushed
at
me
first
with
her
nails
,
she
pulled
*NL*
out
all
my
whiskers
...
It
's
permissable
for
anyone
,
I
should
hope
,
*NL*
to
defend
himself
and
I
never
allow
anyone
to
use
violence
to
me
on
*NL*
principle
,
for
it
's
an
act
of
despotism
.
What
was
I
to
do
?
I
simply
*NL*
pushed
her
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He-he-he
!
''
Luzhin
went
on
laughing
maliciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
keep
on
like
that
because
you
are
out
of
humour
yourself
...
But
*NL*
that
's
nonsense
and
it
has
nothing
,
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
*NL*
woman
question
!
You
do
n't
understand
;
I
used
to
think
,
indeed
,
that
*NL*
if
women
are
equal
to
men
in
all
respects
,
even
in
strength
-LRB-
as
is
*NL*
maintained
now
-RRB-
there
ought
to
be
equality
in
that
,
too
.
Of
course
,
I
*NL*
reflected
afterwards
that
such
a
question
ought
not
really
to
arise
,
*NL*
for
there
ought
not
to
be
fighting
and
in
the
future
society
fighting
is
*NL*
unthinkable
...
and
that
it
would
be
a
queer
thing
to
seek
for
equality
*NL*
in
fighting
.
I
am
not
so
stupid
...
though
,
of
course
,
there
is
*NL*
fighting
...
there
wo
n't
be
later
,
but
at
present
there
is
...
confound
*NL*
it
!
How
muddled
one
gets
with
you
!
It
's
not
on
that
account
that
I
*NL*
am
not
going
.
I
am
not
going
on
principle
,
not
to
take
part
in
the
*NL*
revolting
convention
of
memorial
dinners
,
that
's
why
!
Though
,
of
course
,
*NL*
one
might
go
to
laugh
at
it
...
I
am
sorry
there
wo
n't
be
any
priests
at
*NL*
it
.
I
should
certainly
go
if
there
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
sit
down
at
another
man
's
table
and
insult
it
and
those
*NL*
who
invited
you
.
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
insult
,
but
protest
.
I
should
do
it
with
a
good
object
.
I
*NL*
might
indirectly
assist
the
cause
of
enlightenment
and
propaganda
.
It
's
*NL*
a
duty
of
every
man
to
work
for
enlightenment
and
propaganda
and
the
*NL*
more
harshly
,
perhaps
,
the
better
.
I
might
drop
a
seed
,
an
idea
...
And
*NL*
something
might
grow
up
from
that
seed
.
How
should
I
be
insulting
them
?
*NL*
They
might
be
offended
at
first
,
but
afterwards
they
'd
see
I
'd
done
them
*NL*
a
service
.
You
know
,
Terebyeva
-LRB-
who
is
in
the
community
now
-RRB-
was
blamed
*NL*
because
when
she
left
her
family
and
...
devoted
...
herself
,
she
wrote
to
*NL*
her
father
and
mother
that
she
would
n't
go
on
living
conventionally
and
*NL*
was
entering
on
a
free
marriage
and
it
was
said
that
that
was
too
harsh
,
*NL*
that
she
might
have
spared
them
and
have
written
more
kindly
.
I
think
*NL*
that
's
all
nonsense
and
there
's
no
need
of
softness
;
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
what
's
wanted
is
protest
.
Varents
had
been
married
seven
years
,
she
*NL*
abandoned
her
two
children
,
she
told
her
husband
straight
out
in
a
*NL*
letter
:
'
I
have
realised
that
I
can
not
be
happy
with
you
.
I
can
never
*NL*
forgive
you
that
you
have
deceived
me
by
concealing
from
me
that
there
*NL*
is
another
organisation
of
society
by
means
of
the
communities
.
I
have
*NL*
only
lately
learned
it
from
a
great-hearted
man
to
whom
I
have
given
*NL*
myself
and
with
whom
I
am
establishing
a
community

I
speak
plainly
*NL*
because
I
consider
it
dishonest
to
deceive
you
.
Do
as
you
think
best
.
*NL*
Do
not
hope
to
get
me
back
,
you
are
too
late

I
hope
you
will
be
happy

*NL*
That
's
how
letters
like
that
ought
to
be
written

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
Terebyeva
the
one
you
said
had
made
a
third
free

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

if

were
the
fifteenth

And
if
ever
I
regretted

the
death

my
father

it
is
now

I
sometimes

a

I
would
have
aimed
at
them

To

Pyotr
Petrovitch
*NL*
interrupted
,
``
but
tell
me
this
;
do
you
know
the
dead

daughter

*NL*
delicate-looking
little

true
what
they

n't
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
it
?
I
think
,
that
is
,
it
is
my
own
personal
conviction
that
*NL*
this
is
the
normal
condition
of
women
.
Why
not
?
I
mean
,
_
distinguons
_
.
*NL*
In
our
present
society
it
is
not
altogether
normal
,
because
it
is
*NL*
compulsory
,
but
in
the
future
society
it
will
be
perfectly
normal
,
*NL*
because
it
will
be
voluntary

Even
as
it
is
,
she
was
quite
right
:
she
*NL*
was
suffering
and
that
was
her
asset
,
so
to
speak
,
her
capital
which
*NL*
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
dispose
of
.
Of
course
,
in
the
future
*NL*
society
there
will
be
no
need
of
assets
,
but
her
part
will
have
another
*NL*
significance
,
rational
and
in
harmony
with
her
environment

As
to
Sofya
*NL*
Semyonovna
personally
,
I
regard
her
action
as
a
vigorous
protest
against
*NL*
the
organisation
of
society

I
respect
her
deeply
for
it
;
I
rejoice
*NL*
indeed

I
look
at
her

There

no

established

In

understands
some
questions
,
for
instance
about
kissing
of
*NL*
hands
,
that
is
,
that
it
's
an
insult
to
a
woman
for
a
man
to
kiss
her
*NL*
hand
,
because
it
's
a
sign
of
inequality
.
We
had
a
debate
about
it
and
*NL*
I
described
it
to
her
.
She
listened
attentively
to
an
account
of
the
*NL*
workmen
's
associations
in
France
,
too
.
Now
I
am
explaining
the
question
*NL*
of
coming
into
the
room
in
the
future
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
's
that
,
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
a
debate
lately
on
the
question
:
Has
a
member
of
the
community
*NL*
the
right
to
enter
another
member
's
room
,
whether
man
or
woman
,
at
any
*NL*
time
...
and
we
decided
that
he
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
at
an
inconvenient
moment
,
he-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
was
really
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
thinking
of
something
unpleasant
,
''
he
cried
with
*NL*
aversion
.
``
Tfoo
!
How
vexed
I
am
that
when
I
was
expounding
our
system
,
I
*NL*
referred
prematurely
to
the
question
of
personal
privacy
!
It
's
always
*NL*
a
stumbling-block
to
people
like
you
,
they
turn
it
into
ridicule
before
*NL*
they
understand
it
.
And
how
proud
they
are
of
it
,
too
!
Tfoo
!
I
've
often
*NL*
maintained
that
that
question
should
not
be
approached
by
a
novice
till
*NL*
he
has
a
firm
faith
in
the
system
.
And
tell
me
,
please
,
what
do
you
*NL*
find
so
shameful
even
in
cesspools
?
I
should
be
the
first
to
be
ready
*NL*
to
clean
out
any
cesspool
you
like
.
And
it
's
not
a
question
of
*NL*
self-sacrifice
,
it
's
simply
work
,
honourable
,
useful
work
which
is
*NL*
as
good
as
any
other
and
much
better
than
the
work
of
a
Raphael
and
a
*NL*
Pushkin
,
because
it
is
more
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
more
honourable
,
more
honourable
,
he-he-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
`
more
honourable
'
?
I
do
n't
understand
such
*NL*
expressions
to
describe
human
activity
.
`
More
honourable
,
'
`
nobler
'
--
all
*NL*
those
are
old-fashioned
prejudices
which
I
reject
.
Everything
which
is
*NL*
_
of
use
_
to
mankind
is
honourable
.
I
only
understand
one
word
:
_
useful
_
!
*NL*
You
can
snigger
as
much
as
you
like
,
but
that
's
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
laughed
heartily
.
He
had
finished
counting
the
money
*NL*
and
was
putting
it
away
.
But
some
of
the
notes
he
left
on
the
table
.
The
*NL*
``
cesspool
question
''
had
already
been
a
subject
of
dispute
between
them
.
*NL*
What
was
absurd
was
that
it
made
Lebeziatnikov
really
angry
,
while
it
*NL*
amused
Luzhin
and
at
that
moment
he
particularly
wanted
to
anger
his
*NL*
young
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
your
ill-luck
yesterday
that
makes
you
so
ill-humoured
and
*NL*
annoying
,
''
blurted
out
Lebeziatnikov
,
who
in
spite
of
his
``
independence
''
*NL*
and
his
``
protests
''
did
not
venture
to
oppose
Pyotr
Petrovitch
and
still
*NL*
behaved
to
him
with
some
of
the
respect
habitual
in
earlier
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
tell
me
this
,
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
interrupted
with
haughty
*NL*
displeasure
,
``
can
you
...
or
rather
are
you
really
friendly
enough
with
*NL*
that
young
person
to
ask
her
to
step
in
here
for
a
minute
?
I
think
*NL*
they
've
all
come
back
from
the
cemetery
...
I
heard
the
sound
of
*NL*
steps
...
I
want
to
see
her
,
that
young
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
Lebeziatnikov
asked
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
want
to
.
I
am
leaving
here
to-day
or
to-morrow
and
therefore
I
*NL*
wanted
to
speak
to
her
about
...
However
,
you
may
be
present
during
the
*NL*
interview
.
It
's
better
you
should
be
,
indeed
.
For
there
's
no
knowing
*NL*
what
you
might
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
imagine
anything
.
I
only
asked
and
,
if
you
've
anything
to
say
*NL*
to
her
,
nothing
is
easier
than
to
call
her
in
.
I
'll
go
directly
and
you
*NL*
may
be
sure
I
wo
n't
be
in
your
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
Lebeziatnikov
came
in
with
Sonia
.
She
came
in
very
*NL*
much
surprised
and
overcome
with
shyness
as
usual
.
She
was
always
shy
in
*NL*
such
circumstances
and
was
always
afraid
of
new
people
,
she
had
been
as
*NL*
a
child
and
was
even
more
so
now
...
Pyotr
Petrovitch
met
her
``
politely
*NL*
and
affably
,
''
but
with
a
certain
shade
of
bantering
familiarity
which
in
*NL*
his
opinion
was
suitable
for
a
man
of
his
respectability
and
weight
*NL*
in
dealing
with
a
creature
so
young
and
so
_
interesting
_
as
she
.
He
*NL*
hastened
to
``
reassure
''
her
and
made
her
sit
down
facing
him
at
the
*NL*
table
.
Sonia
sat
down
,
looked
about
her
--
at
Lebeziatnikov
,
at
the
notes
*NL*
lying
on
the
table
and
then
again
at
Pyotr
Petrovitch
and
her
eyes
*NL*
remained
riveted
on
him
.
Lebeziatnikov
was
moving
to
the
door
.
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
signed
to
Sonia
to
remain
seated
and
stopped
Lebeziatnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Raskolnikov
in
there
?
Has
he
come
?
''
he
asked
him
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Raskolnikov
?
Yes
.
Why
?
Yes
,
he
is
there
.
I
saw
him
just
come
in
...
*NL*
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
particularly
beg
you
to
remain
here
with
us
and
not
to
leave
*NL*
me
alone
with
this
...
young
woman
.
I
only
want
a
few
words
with
her
,
*NL*
but
God
knows
what
they
may
make
of
it
.
I
should
n't
like
Raskolnikov
to
*NL*
repeat
anything
...
You
understand
what
I
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
!
''
Lebeziatnikov
saw
the
point
.
``
Yes
,
you
are
right
...
Of
*NL*
course
,
I
am
convinced
personally
that
you
have
no
reason
to
be
uneasy
,
*NL*
but
...
still
,
you
are
right
.
Certainly
I
'll
stay
.
I
'll
stand
here
at
the
*NL*
window
and
not
be
in
your
way
...
I
think
you
are
right
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
returned
to
the
sofa
,
sat
down
opposite
Sonia
,
looked
*NL*
attentively
at
her
and
assumed
an
extremely
dignified
,
even
severe
*NL*
expression
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
do
n't
you
make
any
mistake
,
madam
.
''
*NL*
Sonia
was
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
will
you
make
my
excuses
to
your
*NL*
respected
mamma
...
That
's
right
,
is
n't
it
?
Katerina
Ivanovna
stands
*NL*
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
you
?
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
began
with
great
*NL*
dignity
,
though
affably
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
his
intentions
were
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
yes
;
the
place
of
a
mother
,
''
Sonia
answered
,
timidly
and
*NL*
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
will
you
make
my
apologies
to
her
?
Through
inevitable
*NL*
circumstances
I
am
forced
to
be
absent
and
shall
not
be
at
the
dinner
in
*NL*
spite
of
your
mamma
's
kind
invitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I
'll
tell
her
...
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Sonia
hastily
jumped
up
from
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
that
's
not
all
,
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
detained
her
,
smiling
at
her
*NL*
simplicity
and
ignorance
of
good
manners
,
``
and
you
know
me
little
,
my
*NL*
dear
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
if
you
suppose
I
would
have
ventured
to
trouble
*NL*
a
person
like
you
for
a
matter
of
so
little
consequence
affecting
myself
*NL*
only
.
I
have
another
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
sat
down
hurriedly
.
Her
eyes
rested
again
for
an
instant
on
the
*NL*
grey-and-rainbow-coloured
notes
that
remained
on
the
table
,
but
she
*NL*
quickly
looked
away
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
She
felt
it
*NL*
horribly
indecorous
,
especially
for
_
her
_
,
to
look
at
another
person
's
*NL*
money
.
She
stared
at
the
gold
eye-glass
which
Pyotr
Petrovitch
held
*NL*
in
his
left
hand
and
at
the
massive
and
extremely
handsome
ring
with
a
*NL*
yellow
stone
on
his
middle
finger
.
But
suddenly
she
looked
away
and
,
not
*NL*
knowing
where
to
turn
,
ended
by
staring
Pyotr
Petrovitch
again
straight
*NL*
in
the
face
.
After
a
pause
of
still
greater
dignity
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
chanced
yesterday
in
passing
to
exchange
a
couple
of
words
with
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
poor
woman
.
That
was
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
*NL*
ascertain
that
she
is
in
a
position
--
preternatural
,
if
one
may
so
*NL*
express
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
preternatural
...
''
Sonia
hurriedly
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
it
would
be
simpler
and
more
comprehensible
to
say
,
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
simpler
and
more
comprehen
...
yes
,
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
.
So
then
from
a
feeling
of
humanity
and
so
to
speak
*NL*
compassion
,
I
should
be
glad
to
be
of
service
to
her
in
any
way
,
*NL*
foreseeing
her
unfortunate
position
.
I
believe
the
whole
of
this
*NL*
poverty-stricken
family
depends
now
entirely
on
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
ask
,
''
Sonia
rose
to
her
feet
,
``
did
you
say
something
to
her
*NL*
yesterday
of
the
possibility
of
a
pension
?
Because
she
told
me
you
had
*NL*
undertaken
to
get
her
one
.
Was
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
slightest
,
and
indeed
it
's
an
absurdity
!
I
merely
hinted
at
*NL*
her
obtaining
temporary
assistance
as
the
widow
of
an
official
who
had
*NL*
died
in
the
service
--
if
only
she
has
patronage
...
but
apparently
your
*NL*
late
parent
had
not
served
his
full
term
and
had
not
indeed
been
in
the
*NL*
service
at
all
of
late
.
In
fact
,
if
there
could
be
any
hope
,
it
would
be
*NL*
very
ephemeral
,
because
there
would
be
no
claim
for
assistance
in
*NL*
that
case
,
far
from
it
...
And
she
is
dreaming
of
a
pension
already
,
*NL*
he-he-he
!
...
A
go-ahead
lady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
.
For
she
is
credulous
and
good-hearted
,
and
she
believes
*NL*
everything
from
the
goodness
of
her
heart
and
...
and
...
and
she
is
like
*NL*
that
...
yes
...
You
must
excuse
her
,
''
said
Sonia
,
and
again
she
got
up
to
*NL*
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
n't
heard
what
I
have
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
heard
,
''
muttered
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
sit
down
.
''
She
was
terribly
confused
;
she
sat
down
again
a
third
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seeing
her
position
with
her
unfortunate
little
ones
,
I
should
be
glad
,
*NL*
as
I
have
said
before
,
so
far
as
lies
in
my
power
,
to
be
of
service
,
*NL*
that
is
,
so
far
as
is
in
my
power
,
not
more
.
One
might
for
instance
get
*NL*
up
a
subscription
for
her
,
or
a
lottery
,
something
of
the
sort
,
such
as
*NL*
is
always
arranged
in
such
cases
by
friends
or
even
outsiders
desirous
*NL*
of
assisting
people
.
It
was
of
that
I
intended
to
speak
to
you
;
it
might
*NL*
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
...
God
will
repay
you
for
it
,
''
faltered
Sonia
,
gazing
intently
*NL*
at
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
,
but
we
will
talk
of
it
later
.
We
might
begin
it
to-day
,
we
*NL*
will
talk
it
over
this
evening
and
lay
the
foundation
so
to
speak
.
Come
*NL*
to
me
at
seven
o'clock
.
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
,
I
hope
,
will
assist
us
.
But
*NL*
there
is
one
circumstance
of
which
I
ought
to
warn
you
beforehand
and
*NL*
for
which
I
venture
to
trouble
you
,
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
to
come
here
.
In
*NL*
my
opinion
money
can
not
be
,
indeed
it
's
unsafe
to
put
it
into
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
own
hands
.
The
dinner
to-day
is
a
proof
of
that
.
Though
she
*NL*
has
not
,
so
to
speak
,
a
crust
of
bread
for
to-morrow
and
...
well
,
boots
*NL*

shoes

or
anything
;
she
has
bought
to-day
Jamaica
rum
,
and
even
,
*NL*
I
believe
,
Madeira
and
...
and
coffee
.
I
saw
it
as
I
passed
through
.
*NL*
To-morrow
it
will
all
fall
upon
you
again
,
they
wo
n't
have
a
crust
of
*NL*
bread
.
It
's
absurd
,
really
,
and
so
,
to
my
thinking
,
a
subscription
ought
*NL*
to
be
raised
so
that
the
unhappy
widow
should
not
know
of
the
money
,
but
*NL*
only
you
,
for
instance
.
Am
I
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
...
this
is
only
to-day
,
once
in
her
life

She
was
*NL*
so
anxious
to
do
honour
,
to
celebrate
the
memory
...
And
she
is
very
*NL*
sensible

but
just
as
you
think

I
shall
be
very

very

they
will
*NL*
all
be

and
God
will
reward

and
the
orphans

*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
keep
it
in
mind

and
now
will
you
accept
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
your
relation
the
small
sum
that
I
am
able
to
spare
,
from
me
*NL*
personally

I
am
very
anxious
that

it

*NL*
*NL*
And
Pyotr
Petrovitch
held
out
to
Sonia
a
ten-rouble
note
carefully
*NL*
unfolded
.
Sonia
took
it
,
flushed
crimson
,
jumped
up
,
muttered
something
*NL*
and
began
taking
leave
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
accompanied
her
ceremoniously
*NL*
to
the
door
.
She
got
out
of
the
room
at
last
,
agitated
and
distressed
,
*NL*
and
returned
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
overwhelmed
with
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Lebeziatnikov
had
stood
at
the
window
or
walked
about
the
*NL*
room
,
anxious
not
to
interrupt
the
conversation
;
when
Sonia
had
gone
he
*NL*
walked
up
to
Pyotr
Petrovitch
and
solemnly
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
and
_
saw
_
everything
,
''
he
said
,
laying
stress
on
the
last
verb
.
*NL*
``
That
is
honourable
,
I
mean
to
say
,
it
's
humane
!
You
wanted
to
avoid
*NL*
gratitude
,
I
saw
!
And
although
I
can
not
,
I
confess
,
in
principle
*NL*
sympathise
with
private
charity
,
for
it
not
only
fails
to
eradicate
the
*NL*
evil
but
even
promotes
it
,
yet
I
must
admit
that
I
saw
your
action
with
*NL*
pleasure
--
yes
,
yes
,
I
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
nonsense
,
''
muttered
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
somewhat
disconcerted
,
*NL*
looking
carefully
at
Lebeziatnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
nonsense
!
A
man
who
has
suffered
distress
and
annoyance
as
*NL*
you
did
yesterday
and
who
yet
can
sympathise
with
the
misery
of
others
,
*NL*
such
a
man
...
even
though
he
is
making
a
social
mistake
--
is
still
*NL*
deserving
of
respect
!
I
did
not
expect
it
indeed
of
you
,
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
,
especially
as
according
to
your
ideas
...
oh
,
what
a
drawback
*NL*
your
ideas
are
to
you
!
How
distressed
you
are
for
instance
by
your
*NL*
ill-luck
yesterday
,
''
cried
the
simple-hearted
Lebeziatnikov
,
who
felt
*NL*
a
return
of
affection
for
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
``
And
,
what
do
you
want
with
*NL*
marriage
,
with
_
legal
_
marriage
,
my
dear
,
noble
Pyotr
Petrovitch
?
Why
do
*NL*
you
cling
to
this
_
legality
_
of
marriage
?
Well
,
you
may
beat
me
if
you
*NL*
like
,
but
I
am
glad
,
positively
glad
it
has
n't
come
off
,
that
you
are
*NL*
free
,
that
you
are
not
quite
lost
for
humanity
...
you
see
,
I
've
spoken
*NL*
my
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
want
in
your
free
marriage
to
be
made
a
fool
of
and
*NL*
to
bring
up
another
man
's
children
,
that
's
why
I
want
legal
marriage
,
''
*NL*
Luzhin
replied
in
order
to
make
some
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
preoccupied
by
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Children
?
You
referred
to
children
,
''
Lebeziatnikov
started
off
like
*NL*
a
warhorse
at
the
trumpet
call
.
``
Children
are
a
social
question
and
a
*NL*
question
of
first
importance
,
I
agree
;
but
the
question
of
children
has
*NL*
another
solution
.
Some
refuse
to
have
children
altogether
,
because
they
*NL*
suggest
the
institution
of
the
family
.
We
'll
speak
of
children
later
,
*NL*
but
now
as
to
the
question
of
honour
,
I
confess
that
's
my
weak
point
.
*NL*
That
horrid
,
military
,
Pushkin
expression
is
unthinkable
in
the
*NL*
dictionary
of
the
future
.
What
does
it
mean
indeed
?
It
's
nonsense
,
*NL*
there
will
be
no
deception
in
a
free
marriage
!
That
is
only
the
natural
*NL*
consequence
of
a
legal
marriage
,
so
to
say
,
its
corrective
,
a
protest
.
*NL*
So
that
indeed
it
's
not
humiliating
...
and
if
I
ever
,
to
suppose
an
*NL*
absurdity
,
were
to
be
legally
married
,
I
should
be
positively
glad
of
*NL*
it
.
I
should
say
to
my
wife
:
`
My
dear
,
hitherto
I
have
loved
you
,
now
*NL*
I
respect
you
,
for
you
've
shown
you
can
protest
!
'
You
laugh
!
That
's
*NL*
because
you
are
incapable
of
getting
away
from
prejudices
.
Confound
*NL*
it
all
!
I
understand
now
where
the
unpleasantness
is
of
being
deceived
*NL*
in
a
legal
marriage
,
but
it
's
simply
a
despicable
consequence
of
a
*NL*
despicable
position
in
which
both
are
humiliated
.
When
the
deception
is
*NL*
open
,
as
in
a
free
marriage
,
then
it
does
not
exist
,
it
's
unthinkable
.
*NL*
Your
wife
will
only
prove
how
she
respects
you
by
considering
you
*NL*
incapable
of
opposing
her
happiness
and
avenging
yourself
on
her
for
*NL*
her
new
husband
.
Damn
it
all
!
I
sometimes
dream
if
I
were
to
be
married
,
*NL*
pfoo
!
I
mean
if
I
were
to
marry
,
legally
or
not
,
it
's
just
the
same
,
*NL*
I
should
present
my
wife
with
a
lover
if
she
had
not
found
one
for
*NL*
herself
.
`
My
dear
,
'
I
should
say
,
'
I
love
you
,
but
even
more
than
that
I
*NL*
desire
you
to
respect
me
.
See
!
'
Am
I
not
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
sniggered
as
he
listened
,
but
without
much
merriment
.
*NL*
He
hardly
heard
it
indeed
.
He
was
preoccupied
with
something
else
and
*NL*
even
Lebeziatnikov
at
last
noticed
it
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
seemed
excited
*NL*
and
rubbed
his
hands
.
Lebeziatnikov
remembered
all
this
and
reflected
*NL*
upon
it
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
explain
exactly
what
could
have
originated
the
*NL*
idea
of
that
senseless
dinner
in
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
disordered
brain
.
*NL*
Nearly
ten
of
the
twenty
roubles
,
given
by
Raskolnikov
for
Marmeladov
's
*NL*
funeral
,
were
wasted
upon
it
.
Possibly
Katerina
Ivanovna
felt
obliged
to
*NL*
honour
the
memory
of
the
deceased
``
suitably
,
''
that
all
the
lodgers
,
*NL*
and
still
more
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
might
know
``
that
he
was
in
no
way
their
*NL*
inferior
,
and
perhaps
very
much
their
superior
,
''
and
that
no
one
had
the
*NL*
right
``
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
him
.
''
Perhaps
the
chief
element
was
that
*NL*
peculiar
``
poor
man
's
pride
,
''
which
compels
many
poor
people
to
spend
*NL*
their
last
savings
on
some
traditional
social
ceremony
,
simply
in
order
*NL*
to
do
``
like
other
people
,
''
and
not
to
``
be
looked
down
upon
.
''
It
is
very
*NL*
probable
,
too
,
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
longed
on
this
occasion
,
at
*NL*
the
moment
when
she
seemed
to
be
abandoned
by
everyone
,
to
show
those
*NL*
``
wretched
contemptible
lodgers
''
that
she
knew
``
how
to
do
things
,
how
*NL*
to
entertain
''
and
that
she
had
been
brought
up
``
in
a
genteel
,
she
might
*NL*
almost
say
aristocratic
colonel
's
family
''
and
had
not
been
meant
for
*NL*
sweeping
floors
and
washing
the
children
's
rags
at
night
.
Even
the
*NL*
poorest
and
most
broken-spirited
people
are
sometimes
liable
to
these
*NL*
paroxysms
of
pride
and
vanity
which
take
the
form
of
an
irresistible
*NL*
nervous
craving
.
And
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
not
broken-spirited
;
she
*NL*
might
have
been
killed
by
circumstance
,
but
her
spirit
could
not
have
*NL*
been
broken
,
that
is
,
she
could
not
have
been
intimidated
,
her
will
*NL*
could
not
be
crushed
.
Moreover
Sonia
had
said
with
good
reason
that
her
*NL*
mind
was
unhinged
.
She
could
not
be
said
to
be
insane
,
but
for
a
year
*NL*
past
she
had
been
so
harassed
that
her
mind
might
well
be
overstrained
.
*NL*
The
later
stages
of
consumption
are
apt
,
doctors
tell
us
,
to
affect
the
*NL*
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
great
variety
of
wines
,
nor
was
there
Madeira
;
but
wine
*NL*
there
was
.
There
was
vodka
,
rum
and
Lisbon
wine
,
all
of
the
poorest
*NL*
quality
but
in
sufficient
quantity
.
Besides
the
traditional
rice
and
*NL*
honey
,
there
were
three
or
four
dishes
,
one
of
which
consisted
of
*NL*
pancakes
,
all
prepared
in
Amalia
Ivanovna
's
kitchen
.
Two
samovars
were
*NL*
boiling
,
that
tea
and
punch
might
be
offered
after
dinner
.
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
had
herself
seen
to
purchasing
the
provisions
,
with
the
help
*NL*
of
one
of
the
lodgers
,
an
unfortunate
little
Pole
who
had
somehow
been
*NL*
stranded
at
Madame
Lippevechsel
's
.
He
promptly
put
himself
at
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
disposal
and
had
been
all
that
morning
and
all
the
day
before
*NL*
running
about
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
,
and
very
anxious
*NL*
that
everyone
should
be
aware
of
it
.
For
every
trifle
he
ran
to
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
even
hunting
her
out
at
the
bazaar
,
at
every
instant
called
*NL*
her
''
_
Pani
_
.
''
She
was
heartily
sick
of
him
before
the
end
,
though
*NL*
she
had
declared
at
first
that
she
could
not
have
got
on
without
this
*NL*
``
serviceable
and
magnanimous
man
.
''
It
was
one
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
characteristics
to
paint
everyone
she
met
in
the
most
glowing
colours
.
*NL*
Her
praises
were
so
exaggerated
as
sometimes
to
be
embarrassing
;
she
*NL*
would
invent
various
circumstances
to
the
credit
of
her
new
acquaintance
*NL*
and
quite
genuinely
believe
in
their
reality
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
she
*NL*
would
be
disillusioned
and
would
rudely
and
contemptuously
repulse
the
*NL*
person
she
had
only
a
few
hours
before
been
literally
adoring
.
She
*NL*
was
naturally
of
a
gay
,
lively
and
peace-loving
disposition
,
but
from
*NL*
continual
failures
and
misfortunes
she
had
come
to
desire
so
_
keenly
_
*NL*
that
all
should
live
in
peace
and
joy
and
should
not
_
dare
_
to
break
the
*NL*
peace
,
that
the
slightest
jar
,
the
smallest
disaster
reduced
her
almost
*NL*
to
frenzy
,
and
she
would
pass
in
an
instant
from
the
brightest
hopes
and
*NL*
fancies
to
cursing
her
fate
and
raving
,
and
knocking
her
head
against
*NL*
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
too
,
suddenly
acquired
extraordinary
importance
in
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
eyes
and
was
treated
by
her
with
extraordinary
*NL*
respect
,
probably
only
because
Amalia
Ivanovna
had
thrown
herself
heart
*NL*
and
soul
into
the
preparations
.
She
had
undertaken
to
lay
the
table
,
*NL*
to
provide
the
linen
,
crockery
,
etc.
,
and
to
cook
the
dishes
in
her
*NL*
kitchen
,
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
left
it
all
in
her
hands
and
gone
*NL*
herself
to
the
cemetery
.
Everything
had
been
well
done
.
Even
the
*NL*
table-cloth
was
nearly
clean
;
the
crockery
,
knives
,
forks
and
glasses
*NL*
were
,
of
course
,
of
all
shapes
and
patterns
,
lent
by
different
lodgers
,
*NL*
but
the
table
was
properly
laid
at
the
time
fixed
,
and
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
feeling
she
had
done
her
work
well
,
had
put
on
a
black
silk
dress
and
*NL*
a
cap
with
new
mourning
ribbons
and
met
the
returning
party
with
some
*NL*
pride
.
This
pride
,
though
justifiable
,
displeased
Katerina
Ivanovna
for
*NL*
some
reason
:
``
as
though
the
table
could
not
have
been
laid
except
by
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
!
''
She
disliked
the
cap
with
new
ribbons
,
too
.
``
Could
she
*NL*
be
stuck
up
,
the
stupid
German
,
because
she
was
mistress
of
the
house
,
*NL*
and
had
consented
as
a
favour
to
help
her
poor
lodgers
!
As
a
favour
!
*NL*
Fancy
that
!
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
father
who
had
been
a
colonel
and
almost
*NL*
a
governor
had
sometimes
had
the
table
set
for
forty
persons
,
and
then
*NL*
anyone
like
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
or
rather
Ludwigovna
,
would
not
have
been
*NL*
allowed
into
the
kitchen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
however
,
put
off
expressing
her
feelings
for
the
*NL*
time
and
contented
herself
with
treating
her
coldly
,
though
she
decided
*NL*
inwardly
that
she
would
certainly
have
to
put
Amalia
Ivanovna
down
*NL*
and
set
her
in
her
proper
place
,
for
goodness
only
knew
what
she
was
*NL*
fancying
herself
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
irritated
too
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
hardly
any
of
the
lodgers
invited
had
come
to
the
funeral
,
except
*NL*
the
Pole
who
had
just
managed
to
run
into
the
cemetery
,
while
to
the
*NL*
memorial
dinner
the
poorest
and
most
insignificant
of
them
had
turned
*NL*
up
,
the
wretched
creatures
,
many
of
them
not
quite
sober
.
The
older
*NL*
and
more
respectable
of
them
all
,
as
if
by
common
consent
,
stayed
away
.
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
Luzhin
,
for
instance
,
who
might
be
said
to
be
the
most
*NL*
respectable
of
all
the
lodgers
,
did
not
appear
,
though
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
had
the
evening
before
told
all
the
world
,
that
is
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
*NL*
Polenka
,
Sonia
and
the
Pole
,
that
he
was
the
most
generous
,
*NL*
noble-hearted
man
with
a
large
property
and
vast
connections
,
who
had
*NL*
been
a
friend
of
her
first
husband
's
,
and
a
guest
in
her
father
's
*NL*
house
,
and
that
he
had
promised
to
use
all
his
influence
to
secure
her
*NL*
a
considerable
pension
.
It
must
be
noted
that
when
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
exalted
anyone
's
connections
and
fortune
,
it
was
without
any
ulterior
*NL*
motive
,
quite
disinterestedly
,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
adding
to
*NL*
the
consequence
of
the
person
praised
.
Probably
``
taking
his
cue
''
from
*NL*
Luzhin
,
``
that
contemptible
wretch
Lebeziatnikov
had
not
turned
up
*NL*
either
.
What
did
he
fancy
himself
?
He
was
only
asked
out
of
kindness
*NL*
and
because
he
was
sharing
the
same
room
with
Pyotr
Petrovitch
and
was
a
*NL*
friend
of
his
,
so
that
it
would
have
been
awkward
not
to
invite
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Among
those
who
failed
to
appear
were
``
the
genteel
lady
and
her
*NL*
old-maidish
daughter
,
''
who
had
only
been
lodgers
in
the
house
for
the
*NL*
last
fortnight
,
but
had
several
times
complained
of
the
noise
and
uproar
*NL*
in
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
room
,
especially
when
Marmeladov
had
come
*NL*
back
drunk
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
heard
this
from
Amalia
Ivanovna
who
,
*NL*
quarrelling
with
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
threatening
to
turn
the
whole
*NL*
family
out
of
doors
,
had
shouted
at
her
that
they
``
were
not
worth
the
*NL*
foot
''
of
the
honourable
lodgers
whom
they
were
disturbing
.
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
determined
now
to
invite
this
lady
and
her
daughter
,
``
whose
*NL*
foot
she
was
not
worth
,
''
and
who
had
turned
away
haughtily
when
she
*NL*
casually
met
them
,
so
that
they
might
know
that
``
she
was
more
noble
in
*NL*
her
thoughts
and
feelings
and
did
not
harbour
malice
,
''
and
might
see
*NL*
that
she
was
not
accustomed
to
her
way
of
living
.
She
had
proposed
to
*NL*
make
this
clear
to
them
at
dinner
with
allusions
to
her
late
father
's
*NL*
governorship
,
and
also
at
the
same
time
to
hint
that
it
was
exceedingly
*NL*
stupid
of
them
to
turn
away
on
meeting
her
.
The
fat
colonel-major
-LRB-
he
*NL*
was
really
a
discharged
officer
of
low
rank
-RRB-
was
also
absent
,
but
it
*NL*
appeared
that
he
had
been
``
not
himself
''
for
the
last
two
days
.
The
party
*NL*
consisted
of
the
Pole
,
a
wretched
looking
clerk
with
a
spotty
face
and
*NL*
a
greasy
coat
,
who
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
himself
,
and
smelt
*NL*
abominably
,
a
deaf
and
almost
blind
old
man
who
had
once
been
in
the
*NL*
post
office
and
who
had
been
from
immemorial
ages
maintained
by
someone
*NL*
at
Amalia
Ivanovna
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
retired
clerk
of
the
commissariat
department
came
,
too
;
he
was
*NL*
drunk
,
had
a
loud
and
most
unseemly
laugh
and
only
fancy
--
was
without
*NL*
a
waistcoat
!
One
of
the
visitors
sat
straight
down
to
the
table
without
*NL*
even
greeting
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
Finally
one
person
having
no
suit
*NL*
appeared
in
his
dressing-gown
,
but
this
was
too
much
,
and
the
efforts
of
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
and
the
Pole
succeeded
in
removing
him
.
The
Pole
brought
*NL*
with
him
,
however
,
two
other
Poles
who
did
not
live
at
Amalia
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
and
whom
no
one
had
seen
here
before
.
All
this
irritated
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
intensely
.
``
For
whom
had
they
made
all
these
preparations
*NL*
then
?
''
To
make
room
for
the
visitors
the
children
had
not
even
been
laid
*NL*
for
at
the
table
;
but
the
two
little
ones
were
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
*NL*
furthest
corner
with
their
dinner
laid
on
a
box
,
while
Polenka
as
a
big
*NL*
girl
had
to
look
after
them
,
feed
them
,
and
keep
their
noses
wiped
like
*NL*
well-bred
children
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
in
fact
,
could
hardly
help
meeting
her
guests
with
*NL*
increased
dignity
,
and
even
haughtiness
.
She
stared
at
some
of
them
with
*NL*
special
severity
,
and
loftily
invited
them
to
take
their
seats
.
Rushing
*NL*
to
the
conclusion
that
Amalia
Ivanovna
must
be
responsible
for
those
who
*NL*
were
absent
,
she
began
treating
her
with
extreme
nonchalance
,
which
the
*NL*
latter
promptly
observed
and
resented
.
Such
a
beginning
was
no
good
omen
*NL*
for
the
end
.
All
were
seated
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
came
in
almost
at
the
moment
of
their
return
from
the
*NL*
cemetery
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
greatly
delighted
to
see
him
,
in
the
*NL*
first
place
,
because
he
was
the
one
``
educated
visitor
,
and
,
as
everyone
*NL*
knew
,
was
in
two
years
to
take
a
professorship
in
the
university
,
''
and
*NL*
secondly
because
he
immediately
and
respectfully
apologised
for
having
*NL*
been
unable
to
be
at
the
funeral
.
She
positively
pounced
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
made
him
sit
on
her
left
hand
-LRB-
Amalia
Ivanovna
was
on
her
right
-RRB-
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
her
continual
anxiety
that
the
dishes
should
be
passed
round
*NL*
correctly
and
that
everyone
should
taste
them
,
in
spite
of
the
agonising
*NL*
cough
which
interrupted
her
every
minute
and
seemed
to
have
grown
worse
*NL*
during
the
last
few
days
,
she
hastened
to
pour
out
in
a
half
whisper
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
all
her
suppressed
feelings
and
her
just
indignation
at
*NL*
the
failure
of
the
dinner
,
interspersing
her
remarks
with
lively
and
*NL*
uncontrollable
laughter
at
the
expense
of
her
visitors
and
especially
of
*NL*
her
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
that
cuckoo
's
fault
!
You
know
whom
I
mean
?
Her
,
her
!
''
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
nodded
towards
the
landlady
.
``
Look
at
her
,
she
's
making
round
*NL*
eyes
,
she
feels
that
we
are
talking
about
her
and
ca
n't
understand
.
*NL*
Pfoo
,
the
owl
!
Ha-ha
!
-LRB-
Cough-cough-cough
.
-RRB-
And
what
does
she
put
on
that
*NL*
cap
for
?
-LRB-
Cough-cough-cough
.
-RRB-
Have
you
noticed
that
she
wants
everyone
*NL*
to
consider
that
she
is
patronising
me
and
doing
me
an
honour
by
being
*NL*
here
?
I
asked
her
like
a
sensible
woman
to
invite
people
,
especially
*NL*
those
who
knew
my
late
husband
,
and
look
at
the
set
of
fools
she
has
*NL*
brought
!
The
sweeps
!
Look
at
that
one
with
the
spotty
face
.
And
those
*NL*
wretched
Poles
,
ha-ha-ha
!
-LRB-
Cough-cough-cough
.
-RRB-
Not
one
of
them
has
ever
*NL*
poked
his
nose
in
here
,
I
've
never
set
eyes
on
them
.
What
have
they
come
*NL*
here
for
,
I
ask
you
?
There
they
sit
in
a
row
.
Hey
,
_
pan
_
!
''
she
cried
*NL*
suddenly
to
one
of
them
,
``
have
you
tasted
the
pancakes
?
Take
some
more
!
*NL*
Have
some
beer
!
Wo
n't
you
have
some
vodka
?
Look
,
he
's
jumped
up
and
is
*NL*
making
his
bows
,
they
must
be
quite
starved
,
poor
things
.
Never
mind
,
*NL*
let
them
eat
!
They
do
n't
make
a
noise
,
anyway
,
though
I
'm
really
afraid
*NL*
for
our
landlady
's
silver
spoons
...
Amalia
Ivanovna
!
''
she
addressed
her
*NL*
suddenly
,
almost
aloud
,
``
if
your
spoons
should
happen
to
be
stolen
,
*NL*
I
wo
n't
be
responsible
,
I
warn
you
!
Ha-ha-ha
!
''
She
laughed
turning
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
and
again
nodding
towards
the
landlady
,
in
high
glee
at
her
*NL*
sally
.
``
She
did
n't
understand
,
she
did
n't
understand
again
!
Look
how
*NL*
she
sits
with
her
mouth
open
!
An
owl
,
a
real
owl
!
An
owl
in
new
ribbons
,
*NL*
ha-ha-ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
her
laugh
turned
again
to
an
insufferable
fit
of
coughing
that
*NL*
lasted
five
minutes
.
Drops
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
her
forehead
*NL*
and
her
handkerchief
was
stained
with
blood
.
She
showed
Raskolnikov
*NL*
the
blood
in
silence
,
and
as
soon
as
she
could
get
her
breath
began
*NL*
whispering
to
him
again
with
extreme
animation
and
a
hectic
flush
on
her
*NL*
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
gave
her
the
most
delicate
instructions
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
for
inviting
that
lady
and
her
daughter
,
you
understand
of
whom
I
am
*NL*
speaking
?
It
needed
the
utmost
delicacy
,
the
greatest
nicety
,
but
she
*NL*
has
managed
things
so
that
that
fool
,
that
conceited
baggage
,
that
*NL*
provincial
nonentity
,
simply
because
she
is
the
widow
of
a
major
,
and
*NL*
has
come
to
try
and
get
a
pension
and
to
fray
out
her
skirts
in
the
*NL*
government
offices
,
because
at
fifty
she
paints
her
face
-LRB-
everybody
*NL*
knows
it
-RRB-
...
a
creature
like
that
did
not
think
fit
to
come
,
and
has
*NL*
not
even
answered
the
invitation
,
which
the
most
ordinary
good
manners
*NL*
required
!
I
ca
n't
understand
why
Pyotr
Petrovitch
has
not
come
?
But
*NL*
where
's
Sonia
?
Where
has
she
gone
?
Ah
,
there
she
is
at
last
!
what
is
it
,
*NL*
Sonia
,
where
have
you
been
?
It
's
odd
that
even
at
your
father
's
funeral
*NL*
you
should
be
so
unpunctual
.
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
make
room
for
her
*NL*
beside
you
.
That
's
your
place
,
Sonia
...
take
what
you
like
.
Have
some
of
*NL*
the
cold
entree
with
jelly
,
that
's
the
best
.
They
'll
bring
the
pancakes
*NL*
directly
.
Have
they
given
the
children
some
?
Polenka
,
have
you
got
*NL*
everything
?
-LRB-
Cough-cough-cough
.
-RRB-
That
's
all
right
.
Be
a
good
girl
,
Lida
,
*NL*
and
,
Kolya
,
do
n't
fidget
with
your
feet
;
sit
like
a
little
gentleman
.
*NL*
What
are
you
saying
,
Sonia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
hastened
to
give
her
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
apologies
,
trying
to
*NL*
speak
loud
enough
for
everyone
to
hear
and
carefully
choosing
the
most
*NL*
respectful
phrases
which
she
attributed
to
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
She
added
*NL*
that
Pyotr
Petrovitch
had
particularly
told
her
to
say
that
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
possibly
could
,
he
would
come
immediately
to
discuss
_
business
_
alone
*NL*
with
her
and
to
consider
what
could
be
done
for
her
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
knew
that
this
would
comfort
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
would
flatter
her
*NL*
and
gratify
her
pride
.
She
sat
down
beside
Raskolnikov
;
she
made
him
a
*NL*
hurried
bow
,
glancing
curiously
at
him
.
But
for
the
rest
of
the
time
*NL*
she
seemed
to
avoid
looking
at
him
or
speaking
to
him
.
She
seemed
*NL*
absent-minded
,
though
she
kept
looking
at
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
trying
*NL*
to
please
her
.
Neither
she
nor
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
been
able
to
get
*NL*
mourning
;
Sonia
was
wearing
dark
brown
,
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
on
her
*NL*
only
dress
,
a
dark
striped
cotton
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
message
from
Pyotr
Petrovitch
was
very
successful
.
Listening
to
*NL*
Sonia
with
dignity
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
inquired
with
equal
dignity
how
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
was
,
then
at
once
whispered
almost
aloud
to
*NL*
Raskolnikov
that
it
certainly
would
have
been
strange
for
a
man
of
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
's
position
and
standing
to
find
himself
in
such
*NL*
``
extraordinary
company
,
''
in
spite
of
his
devotion
to
her
family
and
his
*NL*
old
friendship
with
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
I
am
so
grateful
to
you
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
that
you
have
*NL*
not
disdained
my
hospitality
,
even
in
such
surroundings
,
''
she
added
*NL*
almost
aloud
.
``
But
I
am
sure
that
it
was
only
your
special
affection
for
*NL*
my
poor
husband
that
has
made
you
keep
your
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
once
more
with
pride
and
dignity
she
scanned
her
visitors
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
inquired
aloud
across
the
table
of
the
deaf
man
:
``
Would
n't
he
*NL*
have
some
more
meat
,
and
had
he
been
given
some
wine
?
''
The
old
man
made
*NL*
no
answer
and
for
a
long
while
could
not
understand
what
he
was
asked
,
*NL*
though
his
neighbours
amused
themselves
by
poking
and
shaking
him
.
He
*NL*
simply
gazed
about
him
with
his
mouth
open
,
which
only
increased
the
*NL*
general
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
imbecile
!
Look
,
look
!
Why
was
he
brought
?
But
as
to
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
,
I
always
had
confidence
in
him
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
continued
,
``
and
,
of
course
,
he
is
not
like
...
''
with
an
extremely
stern
*NL*
face
she
addressed
Amalia
Ivanovna
so
sharply
and
loudly
that
the
latter
*NL*
was
quite
disconcerted
,
``
not
like
your
dressed
up
draggletails
whom
*NL*
my
father
would
not
have
taken
as
cooks
into
his
kitchen
,
and
my
late
*NL*
husband
would
have
done
them
honour
if
he
had
invited
them
in
the
*NL*
goodness
of
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
was
fond
of
drink
,
he
was
fond
of
it
,
he
did
drink
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
commissariat
clerk
,
gulping
down
his
twelfth
glass
of
vodka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
late
husband
certainly
had
that
weakness
,
and
everyone
knows
*NL*
it
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
attacked
him
at
once
,
``
but
he
was
a
kind
and
*NL*
honourable
man
,
who
loved
and
respected
his
family
.
The
worst
of
it
was
*NL*
his
good
nature
made
him
trust
all
sorts
of
disreputable
people
,
and
he
*NL*
drank
with
fellows
who
were
not
worth
the
sole
of
his
shoe
.
Would
you
*NL*
believe
it
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
they
found
a
gingerbread
cock
in
his
*NL*
pocket
;
he
was
dead
drunk
,
but
he
did
not
forget
the
children
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cock
?
Did
you
say
a
cock
?
''
shouted
the
commissariat
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
did
not
vouchsafe
a
reply
.
She
sighed
,
lost
in
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
you
think
,
like
everyone
,
that
I
was
too
severe
with
him
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
addressing
Raskolnikov
.
``
But
that
's
not
so
!
He
respected
me
,
he
*NL*
respected
me
very
much
!
He
was
a
kind-hearted
man
!
And
how
sorry
I
was
*NL*
for
him
sometimes
!
He
would
sit
in
a
corner
and
look
at
me
,
I
used
to
*NL*
feel
so
sorry
for
him
,
I
used
to
want
to
be
kind
to
him
and
then
would
*NL*
think
to
myself
:
`
Be
kind
to
him
and
he
will
drink
again
,
'
it
was
only
*NL*
by
severity
that
you
could
keep
him
within
bounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
used
to
get
his
hair
pulled
pretty
often
,
''
roared
the
*NL*
commissariat
clerk
again
,
swallowing
another
glass
of
vodka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
fools
would
be
the
better
for
a
good
drubbing
,
as
well
as
having
*NL*
their
hair
pulled
.
I
am
not
talking
of
my
late
husband
now
!
''
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
snapped
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flush
on
her
cheeks
grew
more
and
more
marked
,
her
chest
heaved
.
In
*NL*
another
minute
she
would
have
been
ready
to
make
a
scene
.
Many
of
the
*NL*
visitors
were
sniggering
,
evidently
delighted
.
They
began
poking
the
*NL*
commissariat
clerk
and
whispering
something
to
him
.
They
were
evidently
*NL*
trying
to
egg
him
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
ask
what
are
you
alluding
to
,
''
began
the
clerk
,
``
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
whose
...
about
whom
...
did
you
say
just
now
...
But
I
do
n't
care
!
*NL*
That
's
nonsense
!
Widow
!
I
forgive
you
...
Pass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
took
another
drink
of
vodka
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
sat
in
silence
,
listening
with
disgust
.
He
only
ate
from
*NL*
politeness
,
just
tasting
the
food
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
continually
*NL*
putting
on
his
plate
,
to
avoid
hurting
her
feelings
.
He
watched
Sonia
*NL*
intently
.
But
Sonia
became
more
and
more
anxious
and
distressed
;
she
,
*NL*
too
,
foresaw
that
the
dinner
would
not
end
peaceably
,
and
saw
with
*NL*
terror
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
growing
irritation
.
She
knew
that
she
,
Sonia
,
*NL*
was
the
chief
reason
for
the
`
genteel
'
ladies
'
contemptuous
treatment
of
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
invitation
.
She
had
heard
from
Amalia
Ivanovna
that
*NL*
the
mother
was
positively
offended
at
the
invitation
and
had
asked
the
*NL*
question
:
``
How
could
she
let
her
daughter
sit
down
beside
_
that
young
*NL*
person
_
?
''
Sonia
had
a
feeling
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
already
heard
*NL*
this
and
an
insult
to
Sonia
meant
more
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
than
an
*NL*
insult
to
herself
,
her
children
,
or
her
father
,
Sonia
knew
that
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
would
not
be
satisfied
now
,
``
till
she
had
shown
those
*NL*
draggletails
that
they
were
both
...
''
To
make
matters
worse
someone
*NL*
passed
Sonia
,
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
a
plate
with
two
hearts
*NL*
pierced
with
an
arrow
,
cut
out
of
black
bread
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
flushed
*NL*
crimson
and
at
once
said
aloud
across
the
table
that
the
man
who
sent
it
*NL*
was
``
a
drunken
ass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
was
foreseeing
something
amiss
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
deeply
wounded
by
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
haughtiness
,
and
to
restore
the
*NL*
good-humour
of
the
company
and
raise
herself
in
their
esteem
she
began
,
*NL*
apropos
of
nothing
,
telling
a
story
about
an
acquaintance
of
hers
``
Karl
*NL*
from
the
chemist
's
,
''
who
was
driving
one
night
in
a
cab
,
and
that
``
the
*NL*
cabman
wanted
him
to
kill
,
and
Karl
very
much
begged
him
not
to
kill
,
*NL*
and
wept
and
clasped
hands
,
and
frightened
and
from
fear
pierced
his
*NL*
heart
.
''
Though
Katerina
Ivanovna
smiled
,
she
observed
at
once
that
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
ought
not
to
tell
anecdotes
in
Russian
;
the
latter
was
*NL*
still
more
offended
,
and
she
retorted
that
her
''
_
Vater
aus
Berlin
_
was
a
*NL*
very
important
man
,
and
always
went
with
his
hands
in
pockets
.
''
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
could
not
restrain
herself
and
laughed
so
much
that
Amalia
*NL*
Ivanovna
lost
patience
and
could
scarcely
control
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
the
owl
!
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
whispered
at
once
,
her
*NL*
good-humour
almost
restored
,
``
she
meant
to
say
he
kept
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
,
but
she
said
he
put
his
hands
in
people
's
pockets
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Cough-cough
.
-RRB-
And
have
you
noticed
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
that
all
these
*NL*
Petersburg
foreigners
,
the
Germans
especially
,
are
all
stupider
than
*NL*
we
!
Can
you
fancy
anyone
of
us
telling
how
`
Karl
from
the
chemist
's
'
*NL*
`
pierced
his
heart
from
fear
'
and
that
the
idiot
,
instead
of
punishing
*NL*
the
cabman
,
`
clasped
his
hands
and
wept
,
and
much
begged
.
'
Ah
,
the
fool
!
*NL*
And
you
know
she
fancies
it
's
very
touching
and
does
not
suspect
how
*NL*
stupid
she
is
!
To
my
thinking
that
drunken
commissariat
clerk
is
a
great
*NL*
deal
cleverer
,
anyway
one
can
see
that
he
has
addled
his
brains
with
*NL*
drink
,
but
you
know
,
these
foreigners
are
always
so
well
behaved
*NL*
and
serious
...
Look
how
she
sits
glaring
!
She
is
angry
,
ha-ha
!
*NL*
-LRB-
Cough-cough-cough
.
-RRB-
''
*NL*
*NL*
Regaining
her
good-humour
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
began
at
once
telling
*NL*
Raskolnikov
that
when
she
had
obtained
her
pension
,
she
intended
to
open
*NL*
a
school
for
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
in
her
native
town
T
--
.
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
the
project
,
and
she
*NL*
launched
out
into
the
most
alluring
details
.
It
suddenly
appeared
that
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
in
her
hands
the
very
certificate
of
honour
of
*NL*
which
Marmeladov
had
spoken
to
Raskolnikov
in
the
tavern
,
when
he
told
*NL*
him
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
his
wife
,
had
danced
the
shawl
dance
*NL*
before
the
governor
and
other
great
personages
on
leaving
school
.
This
*NL*
certificate
of
honour
was
obviously
intended
now
to
prove
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
right
to
open
a
boarding-school
;
but
she
had
armed
herself
*NL*
with
it
chiefly
with
the
object
of
overwhelming
``
those
two
stuck-up
*NL*
draggletails
''
if
they
came
to
the
dinner
,
and
proving
incontestably
*NL*
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
was
of
the
most
noble
,
``
she
might
even
say
*NL*
aristocratic
family
,
a
colonel
's
daughter
and
was
far
superior
to
*NL*
certain
adventuresses
who
have
been
so
much
to
the
fore
of
late
.
''
The
*NL*
certificate
of
honour
immediately
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
drunken
*NL*
guests
,
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
did
not
try
to
retain
it
,
for
it
actually
*NL*
contained
the
statement
_
en
toutes
lettres
_
,
that
her
father
was
of
the
*NL*
rank
of
a
major
,
and
also
a
companion
of
an
order
,
so
that
she
really
*NL*
was
almost
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Warming
up
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
proceeded
to
enlarge
on
the
peaceful
and
*NL*
happy
life
they
would
lead
in
T
--
,
on
the
gymnasium
teachers
whom
*NL*
she
would
engage
to
give
lessons
in
her
boarding-school
,
one
a
most
*NL*
respectable
old
Frenchman
,
one
Mangot
,
who
had
taught
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
herself
in
old
days
and
was
still
living
in
T
--
,
and
would
no
doubt
*NL*
teach
in
her
school
on
moderate
terms
.
Next
she
spoke
of
Sonia
who
would
*NL*
go
with
her
to
T
--
and
help
her
in
all
her
plans
.
At
this
someone
at
*NL*
the
further
end
of
the
table
gave
a
sudden
guffaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Katerina
Ivanovna
tried
to
appear
to
be
disdainfully
unaware
of
*NL*
it
,
she
raised
her
voice
and
began
at
once
speaking
with
conviction
of
*NL*
Sonia
's
undoubted
ability
to
assist
her
,
of
``
her
gentleness
,
patience
,
*NL*
devotion
,
generosity
and
good
education
,
''
tapping
Sonia
on
the
cheek
and
*NL*
kissing
her
warmly
twice
.
Sonia
flushed
crimson
,
and
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
suddenly
burst
into
tears
,
immediately
observing
that
she
was
``
nervous
*NL*
and
silly
,
that
she
was
too
much
upset
,
that
it
was
time
to
finish
,
and
*NL*
as
the
dinner
was
over
,
it
was
time
to
hand
round
the
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
deeply
aggrieved
at
taking
no
part
in
*NL*
the
conversation
,
and
not
being
listened
to
,
made
one
last
effort
,
*NL*
and
with
secret
misgivings
ventured
on
an
exceedingly
deep
and
weighty
*NL*
observation
,
that
``
in
the
future
boarding-school
she
would
have
to
pay
*NL*
particular
attention
to
_
die
Waesche
_
,
and
that
there
certainly
must
be
a
*NL*
good
_
dame
_
to
look
after
the
linen
,
and
secondly
that
the
young
ladies
*NL*
must
not
novels
at
night
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
who
certainly
was
upset
and
very
tired
,
as
well
as
*NL*
heartily
sick
of
the
dinner
,
at
once
cut
short
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
saying
*NL*
``
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
was
talking
nonsense
,
that
it
was
the
*NL*
business
of
the
laundry
maid
,
and
not
of
the
directress
of
a
high-class
*NL*
boarding-school
to
look
after
_
die
Waesche
_
,
and
as
for
novel-reading
,
*NL*
that
was
simply
rudeness
,
and
she
begged
her
to
be
silent
.
''
Amalia
*NL*
Ivanovna
fired
up
and
getting
angry
observed
that
she
only
``
meant
her
*NL*
good
,
''
and
that
``
she
had
meant
her
very
good
,
''
and
that
``
it
was
long
*NL*
since
she
had
paid
her
_
gold
_
for
the
lodgings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
at
once
``
set
her
down
,
''
saying
that
it
was
a
lie
to
*NL*
say
she
wished
her
good
,
because
only
yesterday
when
her
dead
husband
*NL*
was
lying
on
the
table
,
she
had
worried
her
about
the
lodgings
.
To
this
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
very
appropriately
observed
that
she
had
invited
those
*NL*
ladies
,
but
``
those
ladies
had
not
come
,
because
those
ladies
_
are
_
*NL*
ladies
and
can
not
come
to
a
lady
who
is
not
a
lady
.
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
at
once
pointed
out
to
her
,
that
as
she
was
a
slut
she
could
not
judge
*NL*
what
made
one
really
a
lady
.
Amalia
Ivanovna
at
once
declared
that
her
*NL*
''
_
Vater
aus
Berlin
_
was
a
very
,
very
important
man
,
and
both
hands
in
*NL*
pockets
went
,
and
always
used
to
say
:
`
Poof
!
poof
!
'
''
and
she
leapt
*NL*
up
from
the
table
to
represent
her
father
,
sticking
her
hands
in
her
*NL*
pockets
,
puffing
her
cheeks
,
and
uttering
vague
sounds
resembling
``
poof
!
*NL*
poof
!
''
amid
loud
laughter
from
all
the
lodgers
,
who
purposely
encouraged
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
hoping
for
a
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
too
much
for
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
she
at
once
declared
,
*NL*
so
that
all
could
hear
,
that
Amalia
Ivanovna
probably
never
had
a
*NL*
father
,
but
was
simply
a
drunken
Petersburg
Finn
,
and
had
certainly
once
*NL*
been
a
cook
and
probably
something
worse
.
Amalia
Ivanovna
turned
as
red
*NL*
as
a
lobster
and
squealed
that
perhaps
Katerina
Ivanovna
never
had
a
*NL*
father
,
``
but
she
had
a
_
Vater
aus
Berlin
_
and
that
he
wore
a
long
coat
*NL*
and
always
said
poof-poof-poof
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
observed
contemptuously
that
all
knew
what
her
family
*NL*
was
and
that
on
that
very
certificate
of
honour
it
was
stated
in
print
*NL*
that
her
father
was
a
colonel
,
while
Amalia
Ivanovna
's
father
--
if
she
*NL*
really
had
one
--
was
probably
some
Finnish
milkman
,
but
that
probably
she
*NL*
never
had
a
father
at
all
,
since
it
was
still
uncertain
whether
her
name
*NL*
was
Amalia
Ivanovna
or
Amalia
Ludwigovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
lashed
to
fury
,
struck
the
table
with
her
fist
,
*NL*
and
shrieked
that
she
was
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
and
not
Ludwigovna
,
``
that
*NL*
her
_
Vater
_
was
named
Johann
and
that
he
was
a
burgomeister
,
and
that
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
_
Vater
_
was
quite
never
a
burgomeister
.
''
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
rose
from
her
chair
,
and
with
a
stern
and
apparently
calm
voice
*NL*
-LRB-
though
she
was
pale
and
her
chest
was
heaving
-RRB-
observed
that
``
if
she
*NL*
dared
for
one
moment
to
set
her
contemptible
wretch
of
a
father
on
a
*NL*
level
with
her
papa
,
she
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
would
tear
her
cap
off
her
*NL*
head
and
trample
it
under
foot
.
''
Amalia
Ivanovna
ran
about
the
room
,
*NL*
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
,
that
she
was
mistress
of
the
house
and
*NL*
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
should
leave
the
lodgings
that
minute
;
then
she
*NL*
rushed
for
some
reason
to
collect
the
silver
spoons
from
the
table
.
*NL*
There
was
a
great
outcry
and
uproar
,
the
children
began
crying
.
Sonia
*NL*
ran
to
restrain
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
but
when
Amalia
Ivanovna
shouted
*NL*
something
about
``
the
yellow
ticket
,
''
Katerina
Ivanovna
pushed
Sonia
*NL*
away
,
and
rushed
at
the
landlady
to
carry
out
her
threat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
minute
the
door
opened
,
and
Pyotr
Petrovitch
Luzhin
appeared
*NL*
on
the
threshold
.
He
stood
scanning
the
party
with
severe
and
vigilant
*NL*
eyes
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
rushed
to
him

aloud

''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
,
edging
by
her
,
went
to
the
opposite
corner
where
Sonia
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
remained
standing
where
she
was
,
as
though
*NL*
thunderstruck
.
She
could
not
understand
how
Pyotr
Petrovitch
could
deny
*NL*
having
enjoyed
her
father
's
hospitality
.
Though
she
had
invented
it
*NL*
herself
,
she
believed
in
it
firmly
by
this
time
.
She
was
struck
too
*NL*
by
the
businesslike
,
dry
and
even
contemptuous
menacing
tone
of
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
.
All
the
clamour
gradually
died
away
at
his
entrance
.
Not
*NL*
only
was
this
``
serious
business
man
''
strikingly
incongruous
with
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
party
,
but
it
was
evident
,
too
,
that
he
had
come
upon
some
*NL*
matter
of
consequence
,
that
some
exceptional
cause
must
have
brought
him
*NL*
and
that
therefore
something
was
going
to
happen
.
Raskolnikov
,
standing
*NL*
beside
Sonia
,
moved
aside
to
let
him
pass
;
Pyotr
Petrovitch
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
notice
him
.
A
minute
later
Lebeziatnikov
,
too
,
appeared
in
the
*NL*
doorway
;
he
did
not
come
in
,
but
stood
still
,
listening
with
marked
*NL*
interest
,
almost
wonder
,
and
seemed
for
a
time
perplexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
for
possibly
interrupting
you
,
but
it
's
a
matter
of
*NL*
some
importance
,
''
Pyotr
Petrovitch
observed
,
addressing
the
company
*NL*
generally
.
``
I
am
glad
indeed
to
find
other
persons
present
.
Amalia
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
I
humbly
beg
you
as
mistress
of
the
house
to
pay
careful
*NL*
attention
to
what
I
have
to
say
to
Sofya
Ivanovna
.
Sofya
Ivanovna
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
addressing
Sonia
,
who
was
very
much
surprised
and
already
*NL*
alarmed
,
``
immediately
after
your
visit
I
found
that
a
hundred-rouble
*NL*
note
was
missing
from
my
table
,
in
the
room
of
my
friend
Mr.
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
.
If
in
any
way
whatever
you
know
and
will
tell
us
where
*NL*
it
is
now
,
I
assure
you
on
my
word
of
honour
and
call
all
present
to
*NL*
witness
that
the
matter
shall
end
there
.
In
the
opposite
case
I
shall
be
*NL*
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
very
serious
measures
and
then
...
you
must
*NL*
blame
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Complete
silence
reigned
in
the
room
.
Even
the
crying
children
were
*NL*
still
.
Sonia
stood
deadly
pale
,
staring
at
Luzhin
and
unable
to
say
a
*NL*
word
.
She
seemed
not
to
understand
.
Some
seconds
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
it
to
be
then
?
''
asked
Luzhin
,
looking
intently
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
...
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
''
Sonia
articulated
faintly
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
know
nothing
?
''
Luzhin
repeated
and
again
he
paused
for
some
*NL*
seconds
.
``
Think
a
moment
,
mademoiselle
,
''
he
began
severely
,
but
still
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
admonishing
her
.
``
Reflect
,
I
am
prepared
to
give
you
time
*NL*
for
consideration
.
Kindly
observe
this
:
if
I
were
not
so
entirely
*NL*
convinced
I
should
not
,
you
may
be
sure
,
with
my
experience
venture
to
*NL*
accuse
you
so
directly
.
Seeing
that
for
such
direct
accusation
before
*NL*
witnesses
,
if
false
or
even
mistaken
,
I
should
myself
in
a
certain
sense
*NL*
be
made
responsible
,
I
am
aware
of
that
.
This
morning
I
changed
for
*NL*
my
own
purposes
several
five-per-cent
securities
for
the
sum
of
*NL*
approximately
three
thousand
roubles
.
The
account
is
noted
down
in
my
*NL*
pocket-book
.
On
my
return
home
I
proceeded
to
count
the
money
--
as
Mr.
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
will
bear
witness
--
and
after
counting
two
thousand
three
*NL*
hundred
roubles
I
put
the
rest
in
my
pocket-book
in
my
coat
pocket
.
*NL*
About
five
hundred
roubles
remained
on
the
table
and
among
them
three
*NL*
notes
of
a
hundred
roubles
each
.
At
that
moment
you
entered
-LRB-
at
my
*NL*
invitation
-RRB-
--
and
all
the
time
you
were
present
you
were
exceedingly
*NL*
embarrassed
;
so
that
three
times
you
jumped
up
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
conversation
and
tried
to
make
off
.
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
can
bear
witness
*NL*
to
this
.
You
yourself
,
mademoiselle
,
probably
will
not
refuse
to
confirm
*NL*
my
statement
that
I
invited
you
through
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
,
solely
in
*NL*
order
to
discuss
with
you
the
hopeless
and
destitute
position
of
your
*NL*
relative
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
-LRB-
whose
dinner
I
was
unable
to
attend
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
the
advisability
of
getting
up
something
of
the
nature
of
a
*NL*
subscription
,
lottery
or
the
like
,
for
her
benefit
.
You
thanked
me
and
*NL*
even
shed
tears
.
I
describe
all
this
as
it
took
place
,
primarily
to
*NL*
recall
it
to
your
mind
and
secondly
to
show
you
that
not
the
slightest
*NL*
detail
has
escaped
my
recollection
.
Then
I
took
a
ten-rouble
note
from
*NL*
the
table
and
handed
it
to
you
by
way
of
first
instalment
on
my
part
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
your
relative
.
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
saw
all
this
.
Then
*NL*
I
accompanied
you
to
the
door
--
you
being
still
in
the
same
state
of
*NL*
embarrassment
--
after
which
,
being
left
alone
with
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
I
*NL*
talked
to
him
for
ten
minutes
--
then
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
went
out
and
I
*NL*
returned
to
the
table
with
the
money
lying
on
it
,
intending
to
count
*NL*
it
and
to
put
it
aside
,
as
I
proposed
doing
before
.
To
my
surprise
one
*NL*
hundred-rouble
note
had
disappeared
.
Kindly
consider
the
position
.
*NL*
Mr.
Lebeziatnikov
I
can
not
suspect
.
I
am
ashamed
to
allude
to
such
*NL*
a
supposition
.
I
can
not
have
made
a
mistake
in
my
reckoning
,
for
the
*NL*
minute
before
your
entrance
I
had
finished
my
accounts
and
found
the
*NL*
total
correct
.
You
will
admit
that
recollecting
your
embarrassment
,
your
*NL*
eagerness
to
get
away
and
the
fact
that
you
kept
your
hands
for
some
*NL*
time
on
the
table
,
and
taking
into
consideration
your
social
position
*NL*
and
the
habits
associated
with
it
,
I
was
,
so
to
say
,
with
horror
and
*NL*
positively
against
my
will
,
_
compelled
_
to
entertain
a
suspicion
--
a
*NL*
cruel
,
but
justifiable
suspicion
!
I
will
add
further
and
repeat
that
in
*NL*
spite
of
my
positive
conviction
,
I
realise
that
I
run
a
certain
risk
in
*NL*
making
this
accusation
,
but
as
you
see
,
I
could
not
let
it
pass
.
I
have
*NL*
taken
action
and
I
will
tell
you
why
:
solely
,
madam
,
solely
,
owing
*NL*
to
your
black
ingratitude
!
Why
!
I
invite
you
for
the
benefit
of
your
*NL*
destitute
relative
,
I
present
you
with
my
donation
of
ten
roubles
and
*NL*
you
,
on
the
spot
,
repay
me
for
all
that
with
such
an
action
.
It
is
too
*NL*
bad
!
You
need
a
lesson
.
Reflect
!
Moreover
,
like
a
true
friend
I
beg
*NL*
you
--
and
you
could
have
no
better
friend
at
this
moment
--
think
what
you
*NL*
are
doing
,
otherwise
I
shall
be
immovable
!
Well
,
what
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
taken
nothing
,
''
Sonia
whispered
in
terror
,
``
you
gave
me
ten
*NL*
roubles
,
here
it
is
,
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
pulled
her
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
,
untied
a
corner
of
it
,
*NL*
took
out
the
ten-rouble
note
and
gave
it
to
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
hundred
roubles
you
do
not
confess
to
taking
?
''
he
insisted
*NL*
reproachfully
,
not
taking
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
about
her
.
All
were
looking
at
her
with
such
awful
,
stern
,
*NL*
ironical
,
hostile
eyes
.
She
looked
at
Raskolnikov
...
he
stood
against
*NL*
the
wall
,
with
his
arms
crossed
,
looking
at
her
with
glowing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
broke
from
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
we
shall
have
to
send
word
to
the
police
and
therefore
*NL*
I
humbly
beg
you
meanwhile
to
send
for
the
house
porter
,
''
Luzhin
said
*NL*
softly
and
even
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Gott
der
Barmherzige
_
!
I
knew
she
was
the
thief
,
''
cried
Amalia
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
throwing
up
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
it
?
''
Luzhin
caught
her
up
,
``
then
I
suppose
you
had
some
reason
*NL*
before
this
for
thinking
so
.
I
beg
you
,
worthy
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
to
*NL*
remember
your
words
which
have
been
uttered
before
witnesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
buzz
of
loud
conversation
on
all
sides
.
All
were
in
*NL*
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
suddenly
realising
the
position
,
and
*NL*
she
rushed
at
Luzhin
.
``
What
!
You
accuse
her
of
stealing
?
Sonia
?
Ah
,
the
*NL*
wretches
,
the
wretches
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
running
to
Sonia
she
flung
her
wasted
arms
round
her
and
held
her
as
*NL*
in
a
vise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonia
!
how
dared
you
take
ten
roubles
from
him
?
Foolish
girl
!
Give
it
*NL*
to
me
!
Give
me
the
ten
roubles
at
once
--
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
snatching
the
note
from
Sonia
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
crumpled
it
up
and
*NL*
flung
it
straight
into
Luzhin
's
face
.
It
hit
him
in
the
eye
and
fell
*NL*
on
the
ground
.
Amalia
Ivanovna
hastened
to
pick
it
up
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
*NL*
lost
his
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
that
mad
woman
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
several
other
persons
,
besides
Lebeziatnikov
,
appeared
in
*NL*
the
doorway
,
among
them
the
two
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Mad
?
Am
I
mad
?
Idiot
!

shrieked
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
``
You
are
an
*NL*
idiot
yourself

pettifogging

Sonia

his

money

Sonia
a
thief

Why
,
she
'd
give
away
her
last
penny
!
''
and
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
broke
into
hysterical
laughter
.
``
Did
you
ever
see
such
an
*NL*
idiot
?
''
she
turned
from
side
to
side
.
``
And
you
too
?
''
she
suddenly
saw
*NL*
the
landlady
,
``
and
you
too
,
sausage
eater
,
you
declare
that
she
is
a
*NL*
thief

you
trashy

's
leg
in

crinoline

She
has
n't
been
*NL*
out
of
this
room
:
she
came
straight
from
you
,
you
wretch
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
beside
me
,
everyone
saw
her
.
She
sat
here
,
by
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
Search
*NL*
her

Since
she
's
not
left
the

You
're
wrong

I

*NL*
You
reckoned
on

You
relied

I

*NL*
*NL*
And
Katerina
Ivanovna
in
a
frenzy
shook
Luzhin
and
dragged
him
towards
*NL*
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready

I
'll
be
responsible

calm

see
that

Well

well

as
to
*NL*
that

Luzhin
muttered
,
``
that
ought
to
be
before
the
police

though
*NL*
indeed
there
are

ready

But
in

any

it

difficult

But
with
*NL*
the
help
of
Amalia
Ivanovna

though

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
will

cried
Katerina
Ivanovna

*NL*
``

turn
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Katerina
Ivanovna
turned
--
or
rather
snatched
--
both
pockets
inside
*NL*
out
.
But
from
the
right
pocket
a
piece
of
paper
flew
out
and
describing
*NL*
a
parabola
in
the
air
fell
at
Luzhin
's
feet
.
Everyone
saw
it
,
several
*NL*
cried
out
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
stooped
down
,
picked
up
the
paper
in
two
*NL*
fingers
,
lifted
it
where
all
could
see
it
and
opened
it
.
It
was
a
*NL*
hundred-rouble
note
folded
in
eight
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
held
up
the
note
*NL*
showing
it
to
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thief
!
Out
of
my
lodging

yelled
Amalia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
``
They
must
to
Siberia
be
sent

Away

*NL*
*NL*
Exclamations
arose
on
all
sides
.
Raskolnikov
was
silent
,
keeping
his
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
Sonia
,
except
for
an
occasional
rapid
glance
at
Luzhin
.
*NL*
Sonia
stood
still
,
as
though
unconscious
.
She
was
hardly
able
to
feel
*NL*
surprise
.
Suddenly
the
colour
rushed
to
her
cheeks
;
she
uttered
a
cry
*NL*
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
n't
I
!
I
did
n't
take
it
!
I
know
nothing
about
it

''
she
cried
*NL*
with
a
heartrending
wail
,
and
she
ran
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
who
clasped
*NL*
her
tightly
in
her
arms
,
as
though
she
would
shelter
her
from
all
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonia
!
Sonia
!
I
do
n't
believe
it

You
see

I
do
n't

it

she
*NL*
cried
in
the
face
of
the
obvious
fact
,
swaying
her
to
and
fro
in
her
*NL*
arms
like
a
baby
,
kissing
her
face
continually
,
then
snatching
at
her
*NL*
hands
and
kissing
them
,
too
,
``
you
took
it
!
How
stupid
these
people
are

*NL*
Oh
dear
!
You

she
cried
,
addressing
the
whole
room

*NL*
is

She

sell
her
last
rag

she

go
barefoot
to

*NL*
you
if
you
needed
it

that
's
what
she
is

She
has
the
yellow
passport
*NL*
because
my
children
were
starving

she
sold
herself
for
us

Ah

husband

*NL*
husband

Do
you
see

Do
you
see

What
a
memorial
dinner
for
you

*NL*
Merciful
heavens

Defend
her

are
you
all
standing
still

do
n't
you
stand
up
for

Do
you
believe

You

not

Good

Defend
*NL*
her
now

*NL*
*NL*
The
wail
of
the
poor
,
consumptive
,
helpless
woman
seemed
to
produce
a
*NL*
great
effect
on
her
audience
.
The
agonised
,
wasted
,
consumptive
face
,
*NL*
the
parched
blood-stained
lips
,
the
hoarse
voice
,
the
tears
unrestrained
*NL*
as
a
child
's
,
the
trustful
,
childish
and
yet
despairing
prayer
for
help
*NL*
were
so
piteous
that
everyone
seemed
to
feel
for
her
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
*NL*
at
any
rate
was
at
once
moved
to
_
compassion
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
madam
,
this
incident
does
not
reflect
upon
you
!
''
he
cried
*NL*
impressively
,
``
no
one
would
take
upon
himself
to
accuse
you
of
being
an
*NL*
instigator
or
even
an
accomplice
in
it
,
especially
as
you
have
proved
*NL*
her
guilt
by
turning
out
her
pockets
,
showing
that
you
had
no
previous
*NL*
idea
of
it
.
I
am
most
ready
,
most
ready
to
show
compassion
,
if
poverty
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
drove
Sofya
Semyonovna
to
it
,
but
why
did
you
refuse
to
*NL*
confess
,
mademoiselle
?
Were
you
afraid
of
the
disgrace
?
The
first
step
?
*NL*
You
lost
your
head
,
perhaps
?
One
can
quite
understand
it
...
But
how
*NL*
could
you
have
lowered
yourself
to
such
an
action
?
Gentlemen
,
''
he
*NL*
addressed
the
whole
company
,
``
gentlemen
!
Compassionate
and
,
so
to
say
,
*NL*
commiserating
these
people
,
I
am
ready
to
overlook
it
even
now
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
personal
insult
lavished
upon
me
!
And
may
this
disgrace
be
a
*NL*
lesson
to
you
for
the
future

''
he
said
,
addressing
Sonia
,
``
and
I
will
*NL*
carry
the
matter
no
further
.
Enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
stole
a
glance
at
Raskolnikov
.
Their
eyes
met
,
and
the
*NL*
fire
in
Raskolnikov
's
seemed
ready
to
reduce
him
to
ashes
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
apparently
heard
nothing
.
She
was
kissing
and
hugging
*NL*
Sonia
like
a
madwoman
.
The
children
,
too
,
were
embracing
Sonia
on
*NL*
all
sides
,
and
Polenka
--
though
she
did
not
fully
understand
what
was
*NL*
wrong
--
was
drowned
in
tears
and
shaking
with
sobs
,
as
she
hid
her
pretty
*NL*
little
face
,
swollen
with
weeping
,
on
Sonia
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
vile
!
''
a
loud
voice
cried
suddenly
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
looked
round
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
vileness
!
''
Lebeziatnikov
repeated
,
staring
him
straight
in
the
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
gave
a
positive
start
--
all
noticed
it
and
recalled
it
*NL*
afterwards
.
Lebeziatnikov
strode
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
dared
to
call
me
as
witness
?
''
he
said
,
going
up
to
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
What
are
you
talking
about
?
''
muttered
Luzhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
you
...
are
a
slanderer
,
that
's
what
my
words
mean

''
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
said
hotly
,
looking
sternly
at
him
with
his
short-sighted
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
extremely
angry
.
Raskolnikov
gazed
intently
at
him
,
as
though
*NL*
seizing
and
weighing
each
word
.
Again
there
was
a
silence
.
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
indeed
seemed
almost
dumbfounded
for
the
first
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
that
for
me
,
...
''
he
began
,
stammering
.
``
But
what
's
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
?
Are
you
out
of
your
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
in
my
mind

but
you
are
a
scoundrel

Ah
,
how
vile

I
have
heard
*NL*
everything

I
kept
waiting
on
purpose
to
understand
it

for
I
must
own
*NL*
even
now
it
is
not
quite
logical

What
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Give
over

are
drunk

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
a

I

not

I
never
touch

vodka

against

Would
you
believe

he
,
he
*NL*
himself
,
with
his
own
hands
gave
Sofya
Semyonovna
that
hundred-rouble
*NL*
note
--
I
saw
it

I
was
a
witness

I
'll
take

*NL*
repeated
Lebeziatnikov
,
addressing
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
crazy
,
milksop
?
''
squealed
Luzhin
.
``
She
is
herself
before
*NL*
you
--
she
herself
here
declared
just
now
before
everyone
that
I
gave

only
ten
roubles

How
could
I
have
given
it
to
her
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
it

I
saw
it

''
Lebeziatnikov
repeated
,
``
and
though
it
is
against
*NL*
my
principles
,
I
am
ready
this
very
minute
to
take
any
oath

like
*NL*
before
the
court
,
for
I
saw
how
you
slipped
it
in
her
pocket
.
Only
*NL*
like
a
fool
I
thought
you
did
it
out
of
kindness
!
When
you
were
saying
*NL*
good-bye
to
her
at
the
door
,
while
you
held
her
hand
in
one
hand
,
with
*NL*
the
other
,
the
left
,
you
slipped
the
note
into
her
pocket
.
I
saw
it
,
I
*NL*
saw
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Luzhin
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
lies
!
''
he
cried
impudently
,
``
why
,
how
could
you
,
standing
by
the
*NL*
window
,
see
the
note
?
You
fancied
it
with
your
short-sighted
eyes
.
You
*NL*
are
raving
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
fancy
it
.
And
though
I
was
standing
some
way
off
,
I
saw
*NL*
it
all
.
And
though
it
certainly
would
be
hard
to
distinguish
a
note
from
*NL*
the
window
--
that
's
true
--
I
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
a
hundred-rouble
*NL*
note
,
because
,
when
you
were
going
to
give
Sofya
Semyonovna
ten
roubles
,
*NL*
you
took
up
from
the
table
a
hundred-rouble
note
-LRB-
I
saw
it
because
I
*NL*
was
standing
near
then
,
and
an
idea
struck
me
at
once
,
so
that
I
did
not
*NL*
forget
you
had
it
in
your
hand
-RRB-
.
You
folded
it
and
kept
it
in
your
hand
*NL*
all
the
time
.
I
did
n't
think
of
it
again
until
,
when
you
were
getting
*NL*
up
,
you
changed
it
from
your
right
hand
to
your
left
and
nearly
dropped
*NL*
it
!
I
noticed
it
because
the
same
idea
struck
me
again
,
that
you
meant
*NL*
to
do
her
a
kindness
without
my
seeing
.
You
can
fancy
how
I
watched
you
*NL*
and
I
saw
how
you
succeeded
in
slipping
it
into
her
pocket
.
I
saw
it
,
I
*NL*
saw
it
,
I
'll
take
my
oath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
was
almost
breathless
.
Exclamations
arose
on
all
hands
*NL*
chiefly
expressive
of
wonder
,
but
some
were
menacing
in
tone
.
They
all
*NL*
crowded
round
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
flew
to
Lebeziatnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
mistaken
in
you
!
Protect
her
!
You
are
the
only
one
to
take
her
*NL*
part
!
She
is
an
orphan
.
God
has
sent
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
doing
,
sank
on
her
knees
*NL*
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pack
of
nonsense
!
''
yelled
Luzhin
,
roused
to
fury
,
``
it
's
all
nonsense
*NL*
you
've
been
talking
!
`
An
idea
struck
you
,
you
did
n't
think
,
you
*NL*
noticed
'
--
what
does
it
amount
to
?
So
I
gave
it
to
her
on
the
sly
on
*NL*
purpose
?
What
for
?
With
what
object
?
What
have
I
to
do
with
this
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
That
's
what
I
ca
n't
understand
,
but
that
what
I
am
telling
*NL*
you
is
the
fact
,
that
's
certain
!
So
far
from
my
being
mistaken
,
you
*NL*
infamous
criminal
man
,
I
remember
how
,
on
account
of
it
,
a
question
*NL*
occurred
to
me
at
once
,
just
when
I
was
thanking
you
and
pressing
*NL*
your
hand
.
What
made
you
put
it
secretly
in
her
pocket
?
Why
you
did
it
*NL*
secretly
,
I
mean
?
Could
it
be
simply
to
conceal
it
from
me
,
knowing
that
*NL*
my
convictions
are
opposed
to
yours
and
that
I
do
not
approve
of
private
*NL*
benevolence
,
which
effects
no
radical
cure
?
Well
,
I
decided
that
you
*NL*
really
were
ashamed
of
giving
such
a
large
sum
before
me
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
too
,
I
thought
,
he
wants
to
give
her
a
surprise
,
when
she
finds
a
whole
*NL*
hundred-rouble
note
in
her
pocket
.
-LRB-
For
I
know
,
some
benevolent
people
*NL*
are
very
fond
of
decking
out
their
charitable
actions
in
that
way
.
-RRB-
Then
*NL*
the
idea
struck
me
,
too
,
that
you
wanted
to
test
her
,
to
see
whether
,
*NL*
when
she
found
it
,
she
would
come
to
thank
you
.
Then
,
too
,
that
you
*NL*
wanted
to
avoid
thanks
and
that
,
as
the
saying
is
,
your
right
hand
*NL*
should
not
know
...
something
of
that
sort
,
in
fact
.
I
thought
of
so
*NL*
many
possibilities
that
I
put
off
considering
it
,
but
still
thought
it
*NL*
indelicate
to
show
you
that
I
knew
your
secret
.
But
another
idea
struck
*NL*
me
again
that
Sofya
Semyonovna
might
easily
lose
the
money
before
she
*NL*
noticed
it
,
that
was
why
I
decided
to
come
in
here
to
call
her
out
of
*NL*
the
room
and
to
tell
her
that
you
put
a
hundred
roubles
in
her
pocket
.
*NL*
But
on
my
way
I
went
first
to
Madame
Kobilatnikov
's
to
take
them
the
*NL*
`
General
Treatise
on
the
Positive
Method
'
and
especially
to
recommend
*NL*
Piderit
's
article
-LRB-
and
also
Wagner
's
-RRB-
;
then
I
come
on
here
and
what
a
*NL*
state
of
things
I
find
!
Now
could
I
,
could
I
,
have
all
these
ideas
and
*NL*
reflections
if
I
had
not
seen
you
put
the
hundred-rouble
note
in
her
*NL*
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lebeziatnikov
finished
his
long-winded
harangue
with
the
logical
*NL*
deduction
at
the
end
,
he
was
quite
tired
,
and
the
perspiration
streamed
*NL*
from
his
face
.
He
could
not
,
alas
,
even
express
himself
correctly
*NL*
in
Russian
,
though
he
knew
no
other
language
,
so
that
he
was
quite
*NL*
exhausted
,
almost
emaciated
after
this
heroic
exploit
.
But
his
speech
*NL*
produced
a
powerful
effect
.
He
had
spoken
with
such
vehemence
,
with
such
*NL*
conviction
that
everyone
obviously
believed
him
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
felt
*NL*
that
things
were
going
badly
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
to
do
with
me
if
silly
ideas
did
occur
to
you
?
''
he
shouted
,
*NL*
``
that
's
no
evidence
.
You
may
have
dreamt
it
,
that
's
all
!
And
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
you
are
lying
,
sir
.
You
are
lying
and
slandering
from
some
spite
against
*NL*
me
,
simply
from
pique
,
because
I
did
not
agree
with
your
free-thinking
,
*NL*
godless
,
social
propositions
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
retort
did
not
benefit
Pyotr
Petrovitch
.
Murmurs
of
disapproval
*NL*
were
heard
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
your
line
now
,
is
it
!
''
cried
Lebeziatnikov
,
``
that
's
*NL*
nonsense
!
Call
the
police
and
I
'll
take
my
oath

There
's
only
one
thing
*NL*
I
ca
n't
understand
:
what
made
him
risk
such
a
contemptible
action
.
Oh
,
*NL*
pitiful
,
despicable
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
explain
why
he
risked
such
an
action
,
and
if
necessary
,
I
,
too
,
*NL*
will
swear
to
it
,
''
Raskolnikov
said
at
last
in
a
firm
voice
,
and
he
*NL*
stepped
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
to
be
firm
and
composed
.
Everyone
felt
clearly
,
from
the
*NL*
very
look
of
him
that
he
really
knew
about
it
and
that
the
mystery
would
*NL*
be
solved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
can
explain
it
all
to
myself
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
addressing
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
.
``
From
the
very
beginning
of
the
business
,
I
suspected
*NL*
that
there
was
some
scoundrelly
intrigue
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
I
began
*NL*
to
suspect
it
from
some
special
circumstances
known
to
me
only
,
which
*NL*
I
will
explain
at
once
to
everyone
:
they
account
for
everything
.
Your
*NL*
valuable
evidence
has
finally
made
everything
clear
to
me
.
I
beg
all
,
*NL*
all
to
listen
.
This
gentleman
-LRB-
he
pointed
to
Luzhin
-RRB-
was
recently
*NL*
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
lady
--
my
sister
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
But
coming
to
Petersburg
he
quarrelled
with
me
,
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
,
at
our
first
meeting
and
I
drove
him
out
of
my
room
--
I
*NL*
have
two
witnesses
to
prove
it
.
He
is
a
very
spiteful
man
...
The
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
I
did
not
know
that
he
was
staying
here
,
in
your
room
,
*NL*
and
that
consequently
on
the
very
day
we
quarrelled
--
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
--
he
saw
me
give
Katerina
Ivanovna
some
money
for
the
funeral
,
*NL*
as
a
friend
of
the
late
Mr.
Marmeladov
.
He
at
once
wrote
a
note
to
*NL*
my
mother
and
informed
her
that
I
had
given
away
all
my
money
,
not
*NL*
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
but
to
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
and
referred
in
a
most
*NL*
contemptible
way
to
the
...
character
of
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
that
is
,
*NL*
hinted
at
the
character
of
my
attitude
to
Sofya
Semyonovna
.
All
this
you
*NL*
understand
was
with
the
object
of
dividing
me
from
my
mother
and
sister
,
*NL*
by
insinuating
that
I
was
squandering
on
unworthy
objects
the
money
*NL*
which
they
had
sent
me
and
which
was
all
they
had
.
Yesterday
evening
,
*NL*
before
my
mother
and
sister
and
in
his
presence
,
I
declared
that
I
had
*NL*
given
the
money
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
for
the
funeral
and
not
to
Sofya
*NL*
Semyonovna
and
that
I
had
no
acquaintance
with
Sofya
Semyonovna
and
had
*NL*
never
seen
her
before
,
indeed
.
At
the
same
time
I
added
that
he
,
*NL*
Pyotr
Petrovitch
Luzhin
,
with
all
his
virtues
,
was
not
worth
Sofya
*NL*
Semyonovna
's
little
finger
,
though
he
spoke
so
ill
of
her
.
To
his
*NL*
question
--
would
I
let
Sofya
Semyonovna
sit
down
beside
my
sister
,
I
*NL*
answered
that
I
had
already
done
so
that
day
.
Irritated
that
my
mother
*NL*
and
sister
were
unwilling
to
quarrel
with
me
at
his
insinuations
,
he
*NL*
gradually
began
being
unpardonably
rude
to
them
.
A
final
rupture
took
*NL*
place
and
he
was
turned
out
of
the
house
.
All
this
happened
yesterday
*NL*
evening
.
Now
I
beg
your
special
attention
:
consider
:
if
he
had
now
*NL*
succeeded
in
proving
that
Sofya
Semyonovna
was
a
thief
,
he
would
*NL*
have
shown
to
my
mother
and
sister
that
he
was
almost
right
in
his
*NL*
suspicions
,
that
he
had
reason
to
be
angry
at
my
putting
my
sister
on
*NL*
a
level
with
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
that
,
in
attacking
me
,
he
was
protecting
*NL*
and
preserving
the
honour
of
my
sister
,
his
betrothed
.
In
fact
he
might
*NL*
even
,
through
all
this
,
have
been
able
to
estrange
me
from
my
family
,
*NL*
and
no
doubt
he
hoped
to
be
restored
to
favour
with
them
;
to
say
nothing
*NL*
of
revenging
himself
on
me
personally
,
for
he
has
grounds
for
supposing
*NL*
that
the
honour
and
happiness
of
Sofya
Semyonovna
are
very
precious
to
*NL*
me
.
That
was
what
he
was
working
for
!
That
's
how
I
understand
it
.
That
's
*NL*
the
whole
reason
for
it
and
there
can
be
no
other
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
this
,
or
somewhat
like
this
,
that
Raskolnikov
wound
up
his
*NL*
speech
which
was
followed
very
attentively
,
though
often
interrupted
by
*NL*
exclamations
from
his
audience
.
But
in
spite
of
interruptions
he
spoke
*NL*
clearly
,
calmly
,
exactly
,
firmly
.
His
decisive
voice
,
his
tone
of
*NL*
conviction
and
his
stern
face
made
a
great
impression
on
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
it
,
''
Lebeziatnikov
assented
gleefully
,
``
that
must
be
*NL*
it
,
for
he
asked
me
,
as
soon
as
Sofya
Semyonovna
came
into
our
room
,
*NL*
whether
you
were
here
,
whether
I
had
seen
you
among
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
guests
.
He
called
me
aside
to
the
window
and
asked
me
in
secret
.
It
was
*NL*
essential
for
him
that
you
should
be
here
!
That
's
it
,
that
's
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Luzhin
smiled
contemptuously
and
did
not
speak
.
But
he
was
very
pale
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
be
deliberating
on
some
means
of
escape
.
Perhaps
he
would
have
*NL*
been
glad
to
give
up
everything
and
get
away
,
but
at
the
moment
this
*NL*
was
scarcely
possible
.
It
would
have
implied
admitting
the
truth
of
*NL*
the
accusations
brought
against
him
.
Moreover
,
the
company
,
which
had
*NL*
already
been
excited
by
drink
,
was
now
too
much
stirred
to
allow
it
.
The
*NL*
commissariat
clerk
,
though
indeed
he
had
not
grasped
the
whole
position
,
*NL*
was
shouting
louder
than
anyone
and
was
making
some
suggestions
very
*NL*
unpleasant
to
Luzhin
.
But
not
all
those
present
were
drunk
;
lodgers
came
*NL*
in
from
all
the
rooms
.
The
three
Poles
were
tremendously
excited
*NL*
and
were
continually
shouting
at
him
:
``
The
_
pan
_
is
a
_
lajdak
_
!
''
and
*NL*
muttering
threats
in
Polish
.
Sonia
had
been
listening
with
strained
*NL*
attention
,
though
she
too
seemed
unable
to
grasp
it
all
;
she
seemed
as
*NL*
though
she
had
just
returned
to
consciousness
.
She
did
not
take
her
*NL*
eyes
off
Raskolnikov
,
feeling
that
all
her
safety
lay
in
him
.
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
breathed
hard
and
painfully
and
seemed
fearfully
exhausted
.
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
stood
looking
more
stupid
than
anyone
,
with
her
mouth
*NL*
wide
open
,
unable
to
make
out
what
had
happened
.
She
only
saw
that
Pyotr
*NL*
Petrovitch
had
somehow
come
to
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
attempting
to
speak
again
,
but
they
did
not
let
him
.
*NL*
Everyone
was
crowding
round
Luzhin
with
threats
and
shouts
of
abuse
.
*NL*
But
Pyotr
Petrovitch
was
not
intimidated
.
Seeing
that
his
accusation
of
*NL*
Sonia
had
completely
failed
,
he
had
recourse
to
insolence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
gentlemen
,
allow
me
!
Do
n't
squeeze
,
let
me
pass
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
.
``
And
no
threats
,
if
you
please
!
I
*NL*
assure
you
it
will
be
useless
,
you
will
gain
nothing
by
it
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
you
'll
have
to
answer
,
gentlemen
,
for
violently
obstructing
*NL*
the
course
of
justice
.
The
thief
has
been
more
than
unmasked
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
prosecute
.
Our
judges
are
not
so
blind
and
...
not
so
drunk
,
and
*NL*
will
not
believe
the
testimony
of
two
notorious
infidels
,
agitators
,
and
*NL*
atheists
,
who
accuse
me
from
motives
of
personal
revenge
which
they
are
*NL*
foolish
enough
to
admit
...
Yes
,
allow
me
to
pass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
me
find
a
trace
of
you
in
my
room
!
Kindly
leave
at
once
,
and
*NL*
everything
is
at
an
end
between
us
!
When
I
think
of
the
trouble
I
've
*NL*
been
taking
,
the
way
I
've
been
expounding
...
all
this
fortnight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
myself
to-day
that
I
was
going
,
when
you
tried
to
keep
me
;
*NL*
now
I
will
simply
add
that
you
are
a
fool
.
I
advise
you
to
see
a
doctor
*NL*
for
your
brains
and
your
short
sight
.
Let
me
pass
,
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
forced
his
way
through
.
But
the
commissariat
clerk
was
unwilling
to
*NL*
let
him
off
so
easily
:
he
picked
up
a
glass
from
the
table
,
brandished
*NL*
it
in
the
air
and
flung
it
at
Pyotr
Petrovitch
;
but
the
glass
flew
*NL*
straight
at
Amalia
Ivanovna
.
She
screamed
,
and
the
clerk
,
overbalancing
,
*NL*
fell
heavily
under
the
table
.
Pyotr
Petrovitch
made
his
way
to
his
room
*NL*
and
half
an
hour
later
had
left
the
house
.
Sonia
,
timid
by
nature
,
had
*NL*
felt
before
that
day
that
she
could
be
ill-treated
more
easily
than
*NL*
anyone
,
and
that
she
could
be
wronged
with
impunity
.
Yet
till
that
*NL*
moment
she
had
fancied
that
she
might
escape
misfortune
by
care
,
*NL*
gentleness
and
submissiveness
before
everyone
.
Her
disappointment
was
*NL*
too
great
.
She
could
,
of
course
,
bear
with
patience
and
almost
without
*NL*
murmur
anything
,
even
this
.
But
for
the
first
minute
she
felt
it
too
*NL*
bitter
.
In
spite
of
her
triumph
and
her
justification
--
when
her
first
*NL*
terror
and
stupefaction
had
passed
and
she
could
understand
it
all
*NL*
clearly
--
the
feeling
of
her
helplessness
and
of
the
wrong
done
to
her
*NL*
made
her
heart
throb
with
anguish
and
she
was
overcome
with
hysterical
*NL*
weeping
.
At
last
,
unable
to
bear
any
more
,
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
*NL*
and
ran
home
,
almost
immediately
after
Luzhin
's
departure
.
When
amidst
*NL*
loud
laughter
the
glass
flew
at
Amalia
Ivanovna
,
it
was
more
than
the
*NL*
landlady
could
endure
.
With
a
shriek
she
rushed
like
a
fury
at
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
considering
her
to
blame
for
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
my
lodgings
!
At
once
!
Quick
march
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
these
words
she
began
snatching
up
everything
she
could
lay
*NL*
her
hands
on
that
belonged
to
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
and
throwing
it
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
pale
,
almost
fainting
,
and
gasping
for
breath
,
*NL*
jumped
up
from
the
bed
where
she
had
sunk
in
exhaustion
and
darted
at
*NL*
Amalia
Ivanovna
.
But
the
battle
was
too
unequal
:
the
landlady
waved
her
*NL*
away
like
a
feather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
As
though
that
godless
calumny
was
not
enough
--
this
vile
creature
*NL*
attacks
me
!
What
!
On
the
day
of
my
husband
's
funeral
I
am
turned
out
of
*NL*
my
lodging
!
After
eating
my
bread
and
salt
she
turns
me
into
the
street
,
*NL*
with
my
orphans
!
Where
am
I
to
go
?
''
wailed
the
poor
woman
,
sobbing
and
*NL*
gasping
.
``
Good
God
!
''
she
cried
with
flashing
eyes
,
``
is
there
no
justice
*NL*
upon
earth
?
Whom
should
you
protect
if
not
us
orphans
?
We
shall
see
!
*NL*
There
is
law
and
justice
on
earth
,
there
is
,
I
will
find
it
!
Wait
a
bit
,
*NL*
godless
creature
!
Polenka
,
stay
with
the
children
,
I
'll
come
back
.
Wait
*NL*
for
me
,
if
you
have
to
wait
in
the
street
.
We
will
see
whether
there
is
*NL*
justice
on
earth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
throwing
over
her
head
that
green
shawl
which
Marmeladov
had
*NL*
mentioned
to
Raskolnikov
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
squeezed
her
way
through
the
*NL*
disorderly
and
drunken
crowd
of
lodgers
who
still
filled
the
room
,
and
,
*NL*
wailing
and
tearful
,
she
ran
into
the
street
--
with
a
vague
intention
*NL*
of
going
at
once
somewhere
to
find
justice
.
Polenka
with
the
two
little
*NL*
ones
in
her
arms
crouched
,
terrified
,
on
the
trunk
in
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
,
where
she
waited
trembling
for
her
mother
to
come
back
.
Amalia
*NL*
Ivanovna
raged
about
the
room
,
shrieking
,
lamenting
and
throwing
*NL*
everything
she
came
across
on
the
floor
.
The
lodgers
talked
*NL*
incoherently
,
some
commented
to
the
best
of
their
ability
on
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
others
quarrelled
and
swore
at
one
another
,
while
others
*NL*
struck
up
a
song
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
it
's
time
for
me
to
go
,
''
thought
Raskolnikov
.
``
Well
,
Sofya
*NL*
Semyonovna
,
we
shall
see
what
you
'll
say
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
set
off
in
the
direction
of
Sonia
's
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
been
a
vigorous
and
active
champion
of
Sonia
against
*NL*
Luzhin
,
although
he
had
such
a
load
of
horror
and
anguish
in
his
own
*NL*
heart
.
But
having
gone
through
so
much
in
the
morning
,
he
found
a
sort
*NL*
of
relief
in
a
change
of
sensations
,
apart
from
the
strong
personal
*NL*
feeling
which
impelled
him
to
defend
Sonia
.
He
was
agitated
too
,
*NL*
especially
at
some
moments
,
by
the
thought
of
his
approaching
interview
*NL*
with
Sonia
:
he
_
had
_
to
tell
her
who
had
killed
Lizaveta
.
He
knew
the
*NL*
terrible
suffering
it
would
be
to
him
and
,
as
it
were
,
brushed
away
the
*NL*
thought
of
it
.
So
when
he
cried
as
he
left
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
we
shall
see
what
you
'll
say
now
!
''
he
was
still
*NL*
superficially
excited
,
still
vigorous
and
defiant
from
his
triumph
over
*NL*
Luzhin
.
But
,
strange
to
say
,
by
the
time
he
reached
Sonia
's
lodging
,
he
*NL*
felt
a
sudden
impotence
and
fear
.
He
stood
still
in
hesitation
at
the
*NL*
door
,
asking
himself
the
strange
question
:
``
Must
he
tell
her
who
killed
*NL*
Lizaveta
?
''
It
was
a
strange
question
because
he
felt
at
the
very
time
*NL*
not
only
that
he
could
not
help
telling
her
,
but
also
that
he
could
*NL*
not
put
off
the
telling
.
He
did
not
yet
know
why
it
must
be
so
,
he
*NL*
only
_
felt
_
it
,
and
the
agonising
sense
of
his
impotence
before
*NL*
the
inevitable
almost
crushed
him
.
To
cut
short
his
hesitation
and
*NL*
suffering
,
he
quickly
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
Sonia
from
the
*NL*
doorway
.
She
was
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
face
in
*NL*
her
hands
,
but
seeing
Raskolnikov
she
got
up
at
once
and
came
to
meet
*NL*
him
as
though
she
were
expecting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
have
become
of
me
but
for
you
?
''
she
said
quickly
,
meeting
*NL*
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
she
was
in
haste
to
say
this
to
him
.
It
was
what
she
had
been
*NL*
waiting
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
to
the
table
and
sat
down
on
the
chair
from
which
she
*NL*
had
only
just
risen
.
She
stood
facing
him
,
two
steps
away
,
just
as
she
*NL*
had
done
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Sonia
?
''
he
said
,
and
felt
that
his
voice
was
trembling
,
``
it
was
*NL*
all
due
to
`
your
social
position
and
the
habits
associated
with
it
.
'
Did
*NL*
you
understand
that
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
showed
her
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
do
n't
talk
to
me
as
you
did
yesterday
,
''
she
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
begin
it
.
There
is
misery
enough
without
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
haste
to
smile
,
afraid
that
he
might
not
like
the
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
silly
to
come
away
from
there
.
What
is
happening
there
now
?
I
*NL*
wanted
to
go
back
directly
,
but
I
kept
thinking
that
...
you
would
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
that
Amalia
Ivanovna
was
turning
them
out
of
their
lodging
*NL*
and
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
run
off
somewhere
``
to
seek
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
cried
Sonia
,
``
let
's
go
at
once
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
snatched
up
her
cape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
everlastingly
the
same
thing
!
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
irritably
.
*NL*
``
You
've
no
thought
except
for
them
!
Stay
a
little
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
...
Katerina
Ivanovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
lose
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
you
may
be
sure
,
she
'll
come
to
you
*NL*
herself
since
she
has
run
out
,
''
he
added
peevishly
.
``
If
she
does
n't
find
*NL*
you
here
,
you
'll
be
blamed
for
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
sat
down
in
painful
suspense
.
Raskolnikov
was
silent
,
gazing
at
*NL*
the
floor
and
deliberating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
time
Luzhin
did
not
want
to
prosecute
you
,
''
he
began
,
not
looking
*NL*
at
Sonia
,
``
but
if
he
had
wanted
to
,
if
it
had
suited
his
plans
,
he
would
*NL*
have
sent
you
to
prison
if
it
had
not
been
for
Lebeziatnikov
and
me
.
*NL*
Ah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
assented
in
a
faint
voice
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
repeated
,
preoccupied
*NL*
and
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
might
easily
not
have
been
there
.
And
it
was
quite
an
accident
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
's
turning
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
'd
gone
to
prison
,
what
then
?
Do
you
remember
what
I
said
*NL*
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
did
not
answer
.
He
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
cry
out
again
`
do
n't
speak
of
it
,
leave
off
.
'
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
gave
a
laugh
,
but
rather
a
forced
one
.
``
What
,
silence
*NL*
again
?
''
he
asked
a
minute
later
.
``
We
must
talk
about
something
,
you
*NL*
know
.
It
would
be
interesting
for
me
to
know
how
you
would
decide
a
*NL*
certain
`
problem
'
as
Lebeziatnikov
would
say
.
''
-LRB-
He
was
beginning
to
lose
*NL*
the
thread
.
-RRB-
``
No
,
really
,
I
am
serious
.
Imagine
,
Sonia
,
that
you
had
*NL*
known
all
Luzhin
's
intentions
beforehand
.
Known
,
that
is
,
for
a
fact
,
*NL*
that
they
would
be
the
ruin
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
the
children
and
*NL*
yourself
thrown
in
--
since
you
do
n't
count
yourself
for
anything
--
Polenka
*NL*
too
...
for
she
'll
go
the
same
way
.
Well
,
if
suddenly
it
all
depended
on
*NL*
your
decision
whether
he
or
they
should
go
on
living
,
that
is
whether
*NL*
Luzhin
should
go
on
living
and
doing
wicked
things
,
or
Katerina
Ivanovna
*NL*
should
die
?
How
would
you
decide
which
of
them
was
to
die
?
I
ask
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
uneasily
at
him
.
There
was
something
peculiar
in
this
*NL*
hesitating
question
,
which
seemed
approaching
something
in
a
roundabout
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
that
you
were
going
to
ask
some
question
like
that
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
looking
inquisitively
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
did
.
But
how
is
it
to
be
answered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
ask
about
what
could
not
happen
?
''
said
Sonia
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
would
be
better
for
Luzhin
to
go
on
living
and
doing
wicked
*NL*
things
?
You
have
n't
dared
to
decide
even
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
know
the
Divine
Providence
...
And
why
do
you
ask
what
*NL*
ca
n't
be
answered
?
What
's
the
use
of
such
foolish
questions
?
How
could
*NL*
it
happen
that
it
should
depend
on
my
decision
--
who
has
made
me
a
judge
*NL*
to
decide
who
is
to
live
and
who
is
not
to
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
the
Divine
Providence
is
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
,
there
is
no
doing
*NL*
anything
,
''
Raskolnikov
grumbled
morosely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
say
straight
out
what
you
want
!
''
Sonia
cried
in
distress
.
*NL*
``
You
are
leading
up
to
something
again
...
Can
you
have
come
simply
to
*NL*
torture
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
control
herself
and
began
crying
bitterly
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
her
in
gloomy
misery
.
Five
minutes
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
're
right
,
Sonia
,
''
he
said
softly
at
last
.
He
was
suddenly
*NL*
changed
.
His
tone
of
assumed
arrogance
and
helpless
defiance
was
gone
.
*NL*
Even
his
voice
was
suddenly
weak
.
``
I
told
you
yesterday
that
I
was
not
*NL*
coming
to
ask
forgiveness
and
almost
the
first
thing
I
've
said
is
to
ask
*NL*
forgiveness
...
I
said
that
about
Luzhin
and
Providence
for
my
own
sake
.
*NL*
I
was
asking
forgiveness
,
Sonia
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
smile
,
but
there
was
something
helpless
and
incomplete
in
*NL*
his
pale
smile
.
He
bowed
his
head
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
a
strange
,
surprising
sensation
of
a
sort
of
bitter
hatred
*NL*
for
Sonia
passed
through
his
heart
.
As
it
were
wondering
and
frightened
*NL*
of
this
sensation
,
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
intently
at
her
;
but
he
*NL*
met
her
uneasy
and
painfully
anxious
eyes
fixed
on
him
;
there
was
*NL*
love
in
them
;
his
hatred
vanished
like
a
phantom
.
It
was
not
the
real
*NL*
feeling
;
he
had
taken
the
one
feeling
for
the
other
.
It
only
meant
that
*NL*
_
that
_
minute
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
again
and
bowed
his
head
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
turned
pale
,
got
up
from
his
chair
,
looked
at
Sonia
,
and
without
*NL*
uttering
a
word
sat
down
mechanically
on
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sensations
that
moment
were
terribly
like
the
moment
when
he
had
*NL*
stood
over
the
old
woman
with
the
axe
in
his
hand
and
felt
that
``
he
must
*NL*
not
lose
another
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
asked
Sonia
,
dreadfully
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
utter
a
word
.
This
was
not
at
all
,
not
at
all
the
way
he
*NL*
had
intended
to
``
tell
''
and
he
did
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
*NL*
him
now
.
She
went
up
to
him
,
softly
,
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
him
and
*NL*
waited
,
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
.
Her
heart
throbbed
and
sank
.
It
*NL*
was
unendurable
;
he
turned
his
deadly
pale
face
to
her
.
His
lips
worked
,
*NL*
helplessly
struggling
to
utter
something
.
A
pang
of
terror
passed
*NL*
through
Sonia
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
she
repeated
,
drawing
a
little
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
Sonia
,
do
n't
be
frightened
...
It
's
nonsense
.
It
really
is
*NL*
nonsense
,
if
you
think
of
it
,
''
he
muttered
,
like
a
man
in
delirium
.
``
Why
*NL*
have
I
come
to
torture
you
?
''
he
added
suddenly
,
looking
at
her
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
really
?
I
keep
asking
myself
that
question
,
Sonia
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
perhaps
been
asking
himself
that
question
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
before
,
but
now
he
spoke
helplessly
,
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
and
*NL*
feeling
a
continual
tremor
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
you
are
suffering
!
''
she
muttered
in
distress
,
looking
intently
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
nonsense
...
Listen
,
Sonia
.
''
He
suddenly
smiled
,
a
pale
*NL*
helpless
smile
for
two
seconds
.
``
You
remember
what
I
meant
to
tell
you
*NL*
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
waited
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
as
I
went
away
that
perhaps
I
was
saying
good-bye
for
ever
,
but
*NL*
that
if
I
came
to-day
I
would
tell
you
who
...
who
killed
Lizaveta
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
I
've
come
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
really
meant
it
yesterday
?
''
she
whispered
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
she
asked
quickly
,
as
though
suddenly
regaining
her
*NL*
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
's
face
grew
paler
and
paler
,
and
she
breathed
painfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
found
him
?
''
she
asked
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
do
you
know
about
_
it
_
?
''
she
asked
again
,
hardly
audibly
and
*NL*
again
after
a
minute
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
her
and
looked
very
intently
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
,
''
he
said
,
with
the
same
distorted
helpless
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shudder
passed
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
...
why
do
you
frighten
me
like
this
?
''
she
said
,
smiling
like
a
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
a
great
friend
of
_
his
_
...
since
I
know
,
''
Raskolnikov
went
*NL*
on
,
still
gazing
into
her
face
,
as
though
he
could
not
turn
his
eyes
*NL*
away
.
``
He
...
did
not
mean
to
kill
that
Lizaveta
...
he
...
killed
her
*NL*
accidentally
...
He
meant
to
kill
the
old
woman
when
she
was
alone
and
*NL*
he
went
there
...
and
then
Lizaveta
came
in
...
he
killed
her
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
awful
moment
passed
.
Both
still
gazed
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
guess
,
then
?
''
he
asked
suddenly
,
feeling
as
though
he
were
*NL*
flinging
himself
down
from
a
steeple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
...
''
whispered
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
good
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
said
this
again
,
the
same
familiar
sensation
froze
his
*NL*
heart
.
He
looked
at
her
and
all
at
once
seemed
to
see
in
her
face
the
*NL*
face
of
Lizaveta
.
He
remembered
clearly
the
expression
in
Lizaveta
's
*NL*
face
,
when
he
approached
her
with
the
axe
and
she
stepped
back
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
putting
out
her
hand
,
with
childish
terror
in
her
face
,
looking
*NL*
as
little
children
do
when
they
begin
to
be
frightened
of
something
,
*NL*
looking
intently
and
uneasily
at
what
frightens
them
,
shrinking
back
and
*NL*
holding
out
their
little
hands
on
the
point
of
crying
.
Almost
the
same
*NL*
thing
happened
now
to
Sonia
.
With
the
same
helplessness
and
the
same
*NL*
terror
,
she
looked
at
him
for
a
while
and
,
suddenly
putting
out
her
left
*NL*
hand
,
pressed
her
fingers
faintly
against
his
breast
and
slowly
began
to
*NL*
get
up
from
the
bed
,
moving
further
from
him
and
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
*NL*
even
more
immovably
on
him
.
Her
terror
infected
him
.
The
same
fear
*NL*
showed
itself
on
his
face
.
In
the
same
way
he
stared
at
her
and
almost
*NL*
with
the
same
_
childish
_
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
guessed
?
''
he
whispered
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
broke
in
an
awful
wail
from
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
helplessly
on
the
bed
with
her
face
in
the
pillows
,
but
a
*NL*
moment
later
she
got
up
,
moved
quickly
to
him
,
seized
both
his
hands
*NL*
and
,
gripping
them
tight
in
her
thin
fingers
,
began
looking
into
his
*NL*
face
again
with
the
same
intent
stare
.
In
this
last
desperate
look
she
*NL*
tried
to
look
into
him
and
catch
some
last
hope
.
But
there
was
no
hope
;
*NL*
there
was
no
doubt
remaining
;
it
was
all
true
!
Later
on
,
indeed
,
when
*NL*
she
recalled
that
moment
,
she
thought
it
strange
and
wondered
why
she
*NL*
had
seen
at
once
that
there
was
no
doubt
.
She
could
not
have
said
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
that
she
had
foreseen
something
of
the
sort
--
and
yet
now
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
told
her
,
she
suddenly
fancied
that
she
had
really
foreseen
*NL*
this
very
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
Sonia
,
enough
!
do
n't
torture
me
,
''
he
begged
her
miserably
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
at
all
,
not
at
all
like
this
he
had
thought
of
telling
her
,
*NL*
but
this
is
how
it
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
jumped
up
,
seeming
not
to
know
what
she
was
doing
,
and
,
wringing
her
*NL*
hands
,
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
room
;
but
quickly
went
back
and
sat
*NL*
down
again
beside
him
,
her
shoulder
almost
touching
his
.
All
of
a
sudden
*NL*
she
started
as
though
she
had
been
stabbed
,
uttered
a
cry
and
fell
on
*NL*
her
knees
before
him
,
she
did
not
know
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
--
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
?
''
she
said
in
*NL*
despair
,
and
,
jumping
up
,
she
flung
herself
on
his
neck
,
threw
her
arms
*NL*
round
him
,
and
held
him
tightly

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
drew
back
and
looked
at
her
with
a
mournful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
strange
girl
,
Sonia
--
you
kiss
me
and
hug
me
when
I
tell
you
*NL*
about
that
...
You
do
n't
think
what
you
are
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
--
no
one
in
the
whole
world
now
so
unhappy
as
you
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
in
a
frenzy
,
not
hearing
what
he
said
,
and
she
suddenly
broke
into
*NL*
violent
hysterical
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
feeling
long
unfamiliar
to
him
flooded
his
heart
and
softened
it
at
*NL*
once
.
He
did
not
struggle
against
it
.
Two
tears
started
into
his
eyes
*NL*
and
hung
on
his
eyelashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
wo
n't
leave
me
,
Sonia
?
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
almost
with
*NL*
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
never
,
nowhere
!
''
cried
Sonia
.
``
I
will
follow
you
,
I
will
follow
*NL*
you
everywhere
.
Oh
,
my
God
!
Oh
,
how
miserable
I
am
!
...
Why
,
why
did
n't
I
*NL*
know
you
before
!
Why
did
n't
you
come
before
?
Oh
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
!
What
's
to
be
done
now
?
...
Together
,
together
!
''
she
repeated
*NL*
as
it
were
unconsciously
,
and
she
hugged
him
again
.
``
I
'll
follow
you
to
*NL*
Siberia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
recoiled
at
this
,
and
the
same
hostile
,
almost
haughty
smile
came
to
*NL*
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
Siberia
yet
,
Sonia
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
looked
at
him
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
after
her
first
passionate
,
agonising
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
man
*NL*
the
terrible
idea
of
the
murder
overwhelmed
her
.
In
his
changed
tone
she
*NL*
seemed
to
hear
the
murderer
speaking
.
She
looked
at
him
bewildered
.
She
*NL*
knew
nothing
as
yet
,
why
,
how
,
with
what
object
it
had
been
.
Now
all
*NL*
these
questions
rushed
at
once
into
her
mind
.
And
again
she
could
not
*NL*
believe
it
:
``
He
,
he
is
a
murderer
!
Could
it
be
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
meaning
of
it
?
Where
am
I
?
''
she
said
in
complete
*NL*
bewilderment
,
as
though
still
unable
to
recover
herself
.
``
How
could
you
,
*NL*
you
,
a
man
like
you
...
How
could
you
bring
yourself
to
it
?
...
What
does
*NL*
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
--
to
plunder
.
Leave
off
,
Sonia
,
''
he
answered
wearily
,
almost
*NL*
with
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
stood
as
though
struck
dumb
,
but
suddenly
she
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
hungry
!
It
was
...
to
help
your
mother
?
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sonia
,
no
,
''
he
muttered
,
turning
away
and
hanging
his
head
.
``
I
was
*NL*
not
so
hungry
...
I
certainly
did
want
to
help
my
mother
,
but
...
that
's
*NL*
not
the
real
thing
either
...
Do
n't
torture
me
,
Sonia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
clasped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
it
,
could
it
all
be
true
?
Good
God
,
what
a
truth
!
Who
could
*NL*
believe
it
?
And
how
could
you
give
away
your
last
farthing
and
yet
*NL*
rob
and
murder
!
Ah
,
''
she
cried
suddenly
,
``
that
money
you
gave
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
...
that
money
...
Can
that
money
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sonia
,
''
he
broke
in
hurriedly
,
``
that
money
was
not
it
.
Do
n't
worry
*NL*
yourself
!
That
money
my
mother
sent
me
and
it
came
when
I
was
ill
,
the
*NL*
day
I
gave
it
to
you
...
Razumihin
saw
it
...
he
received
it
for
me
...
*NL*
That
money
was
mine
--
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
listened
to
him
in
bewilderment
and
did
her
utmost
to
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
_
that
_
money
...
I
do
n't
even
know
really
whether
there
was
any
*NL*
money
,
''
he
added
softly
,
as
though
reflecting
.
``
I
took
a
purse
off
her
*NL*
neck
,
made
of
chamois
leather
...
a
purse
stuffed
full
of
something
...
*NL*
but
I
did
n't
look
in
it
;
I
suppose
I
had
n't
time
...
And
the
*NL*
things
--
chains
and
trinkets
--
I
buried
under
a
stone
with
the
purse
next
*NL*
morning
in
a
yard
off
the
V
--
Prospect
.
They
are
all
there
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
strained
every
nerve
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
...
why
,
you
said
you
did
it
to
rob
,
but
you
took
nothing
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
quickly
,
catching
at
a
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
...
I
have
n't
yet
decided
whether
to
take
that
money
or
*NL*
not

''
he
said
,
musing
again
;
and
,
seeming
to
wake
up
with
a
start
,
he
*NL*
gave
a
brief
ironical
smile
.
``
Ach
,
what
silly
stuff
I
am
talking
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
flashed
through
Sonia
's
mind
,
was
n't
he
mad
?
But
she
*NL*
dismissed
it
at
once
.
``
No
,
it
was
something
else
.
''
She
could
make
*NL*
nothing
of
it
,
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Sonia
,
''
he
said
suddenly
with
conviction
,
``
let
me
tell
*NL*
you
:
if
I
'd
simply
killed
because
I
was
hungry
,
''
laying
stress
on
*NL*
every
word
and
looking
enigmatically
but
sincerely
at
her
,
``
I
should
*NL*
be
_
happy
_
now
.
You
must
believe
that
!
What
would
it
matter
to
you
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
a
moment
later
with
a
sort
of
despair
,
``
what
would
it
matter
to
*NL*
you
if
I
were
to
confess
that
I
did
wrong

What
do
you
gain
by
such
*NL*
a
stupid
triumph
over
me
?
Ah
,
Sonia
,
was
it
for
that
I
've
come
to
you
*NL*
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Sonia
tried
to
say
something
,
but
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
you
to
go
with
me
yesterday
because
you
are
all
I
have
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
where
?
''
asked
Sonia
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
steal
and
not
to
murder

do
n't
be
anxious

''
he
smiled
bitterly
.
*NL*
``
We
are
so
different
...
And
you
know
,
Sonia
,
it
's
only
now
,
only
this
*NL*
moment
that
I
understand
_
where
_
I
asked
you
to
go
with
me
yesterday
!
*NL*
Yesterday
when
I
said
it
I
did
not
know
where
.
I
asked
you
for
one
*NL*
thing
,
I
came
to
you
for
one
thing
--
not
to
leave
me
.
You
wo
n't
leave
me
,
*NL*
Sonia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
squeezed
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
,
why
did
I
tell
her
?
Why
did
I
let
her
know
?
''
he
cried
a
minute
*NL*
later
in
despair
,
looking
with
infinite
anguish
at
her
.
``
Here
you
expect
*NL*
an
explanation
from
me
,
Sonia
;
you
are
sitting
and
waiting
for
it
,
I
see
*NL*
that
.
But
what
can
I
tell
you
?
You
wo
n't
understand
and
will
only
suffer
*NL*
misery
...
on
my
account
!
Well
,
you
are
crying
and
embracing
me
again
.
*NL*
Why
do
you
do
it
?
Because
I
could
n't
bear
my
burden
and
have
come
to
*NL*
throw
it
on
another
:
you
suffer
too
,
and
I
shall
feel
better
!
And
can
*NL*
you
love
such
a
mean
wretch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
n't
you
suffering
,
too
?
''
cried
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
a
wave
of
the
same
feeling
surged
into
his
heart
,
and
again
for
an
*NL*
instant
softened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonia
,
I
have
a
bad
heart
,
take
note
of
that

It
may
explain
a
great
*NL*
deal

I
have
come
because
I
am
bad
.
There
are
men
who
would
n't
have
*NL*
come
.
But
I
am
a
coward
and
...
a
mean
wretch
.
But
...
never
mind
!
That
's
*NL*
not
the
point
.
I
must
speak
now
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
sank
into
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
we
are
so
different
,
''
he
cried
again
,
``
we
are
not
alike
.
And
why
,
*NL*
why
did
I
come
?
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
was
a
good
thing
you
came
,
''
cried
Sonia
.
``
It
's
better
I
*NL*
should
know
,
far
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
with
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
it
were
really
that
?
''
he
said
,
as
though
reaching
a
conclusion
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
what
it
was
!
I
wanted
to
become
a
Napoleon
,
that
is
why
I
*NL*
killed
her
...
Do
you
understand
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
,
''
Sonia
whispered
naively
and
timidly
.
``
Only
speak
,
speak
,
I
shall
*NL*
understand
,
I
shall
understand
_
in
myself
_
!
''
she
kept
begging
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
understand
?
Very
well
,
we
shall
see
!
''
He
paused
and
was
for
some
*NL*
time
lost
in
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
like
this
:
I
asked
myself
one
day
this
question
--
what
if
*NL*
Napoleon
,
for
instance
,
had
happened
to
be
in
my
place
,
and
if
he
had
*NL*
not
had
Toulon
nor
Egypt
nor
the
passage
of
Mont
Blanc
to
begin
his
*NL*
career
with
,
but
instead
of
all
those
picturesque
and
monumental
things
,
*NL*
there
had
simply
been
some
ridiculous
old
hag
,
a
pawnbroker
,
who
had
*NL*
to
be
murdered
too
to
get
money
from
her
trunk
-LRB-
for
his
career
,
you
*NL*
understand
-RRB-
.
Well
,
would
he
have
brought
himself
to
that
if
there
had
*NL*
been
no
other
means
?
Would
n't
he
have
felt
a
pang
at
its
being
so
far
*NL*
from
monumental
and
...
and
sinful
,
too
?
Well
,
I
must
tell
you
that
I
*NL*
worried
myself
fearfully
over
that
`
question
'
so
that
I
was
awfully
*NL*
ashamed
when
I
guessed
at
last
-LRB-
all
of
a
sudden
,
somehow
-RRB-
that
it
would
*NL*
not
have
given
him
the
least
pang
,
that
it
would
not
even
have
struck
*NL*
him
that
it
was
not
monumental
...
that
he
would
not
have
seen
that
there
*NL*
was
anything
in
it
to
pause
over
,
and
that
,
if
he
had
had
no
other
way
,
*NL*
he
would
have
strangled
her
in
a
minute
without
thinking
about
it
!
*NL*
Well
,
I
too
...
left
off
thinking
about
it
...
murdered
her
,
following
*NL*
his
example
.
And
that
's
exactly
how
it
was
!
Do
you
think
it
funny
?
Yes
,
*NL*
Sonia
,
the
funniest
thing
of
all
is
that
perhaps
that
's
just
how
it
*NL*
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
did
not
think
it
at
all
funny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
tell
me
straight
out
...
without
examples
,
''
she
begged
,
*NL*
still
more
timidly
and
scarcely
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
her
,
looked
sadly
at
her
and
took
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
again
,
Sonia
.
Of
course
that
's
all
nonsense
,
it
's
almost
*NL*
all
talk
!
You
see
,
you
know
of
course
that
my
mother
has
scarcely
*NL*
anything
,
my
sister
happened
to
have
a
good
education
and
was
condemned
*NL*
to
drudge
as
a
governess
.
All
their
hopes
were
centered
on
me
.
I
was
a
*NL*
student
,
but
I
could
n't
keep
myself
at
the
university
and
was
forced
*NL*
for
a
time
to
leave
it
.
Even
if
I
had
lingered
on
like
that
,
in
ten
*NL*
or
twelve
years
I
might
-LRB-
with
luck
-RRB-
hope
to
be
some
sort
of
teacher
or
*NL*
clerk
with
a
salary
of
a
thousand
roubles
''
-LRB-
he
repeated
it
as
though
it
*NL*
were
a
lesson
-RRB-
``
and
by
that
time
my
mother
would
be
worn
out
with
grief
*NL*
and
anxiety
and
I
could
not
succeed
in
keeping
her
in
comfort
while
my
*NL*
sister
...
well
,
my
sister
might
well
have
fared
worse
!
And
it
's
a
hard
*NL*
thing
to
pass
everything
by
all
one
's
life
,
to
turn
one
's
back
upon
*NL*
everything
,
to
forget
one
's
mother
and
decorously
accept
the
insults
*NL*
inflicted
on
one
's
sister
.
Why
should
one
?
When
one
has
buried
them
to
*NL*
burden
oneself
with
others
--
wife
and
children
--
and
to
leave
them
again
*NL*
without
a
farthing
?
So
I
resolved
to
gain
possession
of
the
old
woman
's
*NL*
money
and
to
use
it
for
my
first
years
without
worrying
my
mother
,
*NL*
to
keep
myself
at
the
university
and
for
a
little
while
after
leaving
*NL*
it
--
and
to
do
this
all
on
a
broad
,
thorough
scale
,
so
as
to
build
up
*NL*
a
completely
new
career
and
enter
upon
a
new
life
of
independence
...
*NL*
Well
...
that
's
all
...
Well
,
of
course
in
killing
the
old
woman
I
did
*NL*
wrong
...
Well
,
that
's
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
struggled
to
the
end
of
his
speech
in
exhaustion
and
let
his
head
*NL*
sink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
not
it
,
that
's
not
it

''
Sonia
cried
in
distress
.
``
How
could
*NL*
one

no

that
's
not
right

not
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
yourself

*NL*

at

There
were

quite

quite
other

I

so

My

aches
dreadfully
now

*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
shone
with
feverish
brilliance
.
He
was
almost
delirious
;
an
*NL*
uneasy
smile
strayed
on
his
lips
.
His
terrible
exhaustion
could
be
seen
*NL*
through
his
excitement
.
Sonia
saw
how
he
was
suffering
.
She
too
*NL*
was
growing
dizzy
.
And
he
talked
so
strangely
;
it
seemed
somehow
*NL*
comprehensible
,
but
yet
...
``
But
how
,
how
!
Good
God
!
''
And
she
wrung
her
*NL*
hands
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sonia
,
that
's
not
it

''
he
began
again
suddenly
,
raising
his
head
,
*NL*
as
though
a
new
and
sudden
train
of
thought
had
struck
and
as
it
were
*NL*
roused
him
--
``
that
's
not
it
!
Better
...
imagine
--
yes
,
it
's
certainly
*NL*
better
--
imagine
that
I
am
vain
,
envious
,
malicious
,
base
,
vindictive
*NL*
and
...
well
,
perhaps
with
a
tendency
to
insanity
.
-LRB-
Let
's
have
it
all
out
*NL*
at
once
!
They
've
talked
of
madness
already
,
I
noticed
.
-RRB-
I
told
you
just
*NL*
now
I
could
not
keep
myself
at
the
university
.
But
do
you
know
that
*NL*
perhaps
I
might
have
done
?
My
mother
would
have
sent
me
what
I
needed
*NL*
for
the
fees
and
I
could
have
earned
enough
for
clothes
,
boots
and
food
,
*NL*
no
doubt
.
Lessons
had
turned
up
at
half
a
rouble
.
Razumihin
works
!
But
I
*NL*
turned
sulky
and
would
n't
.
-LRB-
Yes
,
sulkiness
,
that
's
the
right
word
for
*NL*
it
!
-RRB-
I
sat
in
my
room
like
a
spider
.
You
've
been
in
my
den
,
you
've
seen
*NL*
it
...
And
do
you
know
,
Sonia
,
that
low
ceilings
and
tiny
rooms
cramp
*NL*
the
soul
and
the
mind
?
Ah
,
how
I
hated
that
garret
!
And
yet
I
would
n't
*NL*
go
out
of
it
!
I
would
n't
on
purpose
!
I
did
n't
go
out
for
days
together
,
*NL*
and
I
would
n't
work
,
I
would
n't
even
eat
,
I
just
lay
there
doing
*NL*
nothing
.
If
Nastasya
brought
me
anything
,
I
ate
it
,
if
she
did
n't
,
I
*NL*
went
all
day
without
;
I
would
n't
ask
,
on
purpose
,
from
sulkiness
!
At
*NL*
night
I
had
no
light
,
I
lay
in
the
dark
and
I
would
n't
earn
money
for
*NL*
candles
.
I
ought
to
have
studied
,
but
I
sold
my
books
;
and
the
dust
lies
*NL*
an
inch
thick
on
the
notebooks
on
my
table
.
I
preferred
lying
still
and
*NL*
thinking
.
And
I
kept
thinking
...
And
I
had
dreams
all
the
time
,
strange
*NL*
dreams
of
all
sorts
,
no
need
to
describe
!
Only
then
I
began
to
fancy
*NL*
that
...
No
,
that
's
not
it
!
Again
I
am
telling
you
wrong
!
You
see
I
kept
*NL*
asking
myself
then
:
why
am
I
so
stupid
that
if
others
are
stupid
--
and
I
*NL*
know
they
are
--
yet
I
wo
n't
be
wiser
?
Then
I
saw
,
Sonia
,
that
if
one
*NL*
waits
for
everyone
to
get
wiser
it
will
take
too
long
...
Afterwards
I
*NL*
understood
that
that
would
never
come
to
pass
,
that
men
wo
n't
change
and
*NL*
that
nobody
can
alter
it
and
that
it
's
not
worth
wasting
effort
over
it
.
*NL*
Yes
,
that
's
so
.
That
's
the
law
of
their
nature
,
Sonia
,
...
that
's
so
!
...
*NL*
And
I
know
now
,
Sonia
,
that
whoever
is
strong
in
mind
and
spirit
will
*NL*
have
power
over
them
.
Anyone
who
is
greatly
daring
is
right
in
their
*NL*
eyes
.
He
who
despises
most
things
will
be
a
lawgiver
among
them
and
he
*NL*
who
dares
most
of
all
will
be
most
in
the
right
!
So
it
has
been
till
now
*NL*
and
so
it
will
always
be
.
A
man
must
be
blind
not
to
see
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Raskolnikov
looked
at
Sonia
as
he
said
this
,
he
no
longer
cared
*NL*
whether
she
understood
or
not
.
The
fever
had
complete
hold
of
him
;
he
*NL*
was
in
a
sort
of
gloomy
ecstasy
-LRB-
he
certainly
had
been
too
long
without
*NL*
talking
to
anyone
-RRB-
.
Sonia
felt
that
his
gloomy
creed
had
become
his
*NL*
faith
and
code
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
divined
then
,
Sonia
,
''
he
went
on
eagerly
,
``
that
power
is
only
*NL*
vouchsafed
to
the
man
who
dares
to
stoop
and
pick
it
up
.
There
is
only
*NL*
one
thing
,
one
thing
needful
:
one
has
only
to
dare
!
Then
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
my
life
an
idea
took
shape
in
my
mind
which
no
one
had
ever
*NL*
thought
of
before
me
,
no
one
!
I
saw
clear
as
daylight
how
strange
it
is
*NL*
that
not
a
single
person
living
in
this
mad
world
has
had
the
daring
to
*NL*
go
straight
for
it
all
and
send
it
flying
to
the
devil
!
I.
.
.
I
wanted
*NL*
_
to
have
the
daring
_
...
and
I
killed
her
.
I
only
wanted
to
have
the
*NL*
daring
,
Sonia
!
That
was
the
whole
cause
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
hush
,
hush
,
''
cried
Sonia
,
clasping
her
hands
.
``
You
turned
away
from
*NL*
God
and
God
has
smitten
you
,
has
given
you
over
to
the
devil

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Sonia
,
when
I
used
to
lie
there
in
the
dark
and
all
this
became
*NL*
clear
to
me
,
was
it
a
temptation
of
the
devil
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
do
n't
laugh
,
blasphemer
!
You
do
n't
understand
,
you
do
n't
*NL*
understand
!
Oh
God
!
He
wo
n't
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Sonia
!
I
am
not
laughing
.
I
know
myself
that
it
was
the
devil
*NL*
leading
me
.
Hush
,
Sonia
,
hush
!
''
he
repeated
with
gloomy
insistence
.
``
I
*NL*
know
it
all
,
I
have
thought
it
all
over
and
over
and
whispered
it
all
*NL*
over
to
myself
,
lying
there
in
the
dark
...
I
've
argued
it
all
over
with
*NL*
myself
,
every
point
of
it
,
and
I
know
it
all
,
all
!
And
how
sick
,
how
*NL*
sick
I
was
then
of
going
over
it
all
!
I
have
kept
wanting
to
forget
it
*NL*
and
make
a
new
beginning
,
Sonia
,
and
leave
off
thinking
.
And
you
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
that
I
went
into
it
headlong
like
a
fool
?
I
went
into
it
like
a
*NL*
wise
man
,
and
that
was
just
my
destruction
.
And
you
must
n't
suppose
that
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
,
for
instance
,
that
if
I
began
to
question
myself
whether
*NL*
I
had
the
right
to
gain
power
--
I
certainly
had
n't
the
right
--
or
that
if
*NL*
I
asked
myself
whether
a
human
being
is
a
louse
it
proved
that
it
was
n't
*NL*
so
for
me
,
though
it
might
be
for
a
man
who
would
go
straight
to
his
*NL*
goal
without
asking
questions
...
If
I
worried
myself
all
those
days
,
*NL*
wondering
whether
Napoleon
would
have
done
it
or
not
,
I
felt
clearly
*NL*
of
course
that
I
was
n't
Napoleon
.
I
had
to
endure
all
the
agony
of
that
*NL*
battle
of
ideas
,
Sonia
,
and
I
longed
to
throw
it
off
:
I
wanted
to
murder
*NL*
without
casuistry
,
to
murder
for
my
own
sake
,
for
myself
alone
!
I
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
lie
about
it
even
to
myself
.
It
was
n't
to
help
my
mother
I
did
*NL*
the
murder
--
that
's
nonsense
--
I
did
n't
do
the
murder
to
gain
wealth
and
*NL*
power
and
to
become
a
benefactor
of
mankind
.
Nonsense
!
I
simply
did
it
;
*NL*
I
did
the
murder
for
myself
,
for
myself
alone
,
and
whether
I
became
a
*NL*
benefactor
to
others
,
or
spent
my
life
like
a
spider
catching
men
in
*NL*
my
web
and
sucking
the
life
out
of
men
,
I
could
n't
have
cared
at
that
*NL*
moment
...
And
it
was
not
the
money
I
wanted
,
Sonia
,
when
I
did
it
.
It
*NL*
was
not
so
much
the
money
I
wanted
,
but
something
else
...
I
know
it
all
*NL*
now
...
Understand
me
!
Perhaps
I
should
never
have
committed
a
murder
*NL*
again
.
I
wanted
to
find
out
something
else
;
it
was
something
else
led
*NL*
me
on
.
I
wanted
to
find
out
then
and
quickly
whether
I
was
a
louse
*NL*
like
everybody
else
or
a
man
.
Whether
I
can
step
over
barriers
or
*NL*
not
,
whether
I
dare
stoop
to
pick
up

not

whether
I
am
a
trembling

creature

whether
I
have
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

Sonia
clasped
her
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach

Sonia
!
''
he
cried
irritably
and
seemed
about
to
make
some
retort
,
*NL*
but
was
contemptuously
silent
.
``
Do
n't
interrupt
me

shown
me

cried
in
a

sudden
spasm
of
agony

He
leaned
his
elbows
on

knees

squeezed
his
head
in
his
hands
as

in
a
vise

A
wail

anguish
broke
from
Sonia

suddenly
raising

hideously
distorted

jumping
up

her
eyes

full

suddenly
began
to

seized

up

almost
bewildered

gazing

understand
.
Why
should
I
go
to
them
?
I
wo
n't
.
Do
n't
be
a
child
,
*NL*
Sonia
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
too
much
for
you
to
bear
,
too
much
!
''
she
repeated
,
holding
*NL*
out
her
hands
in
despairing
supplication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
've
been
unfair
to
myself
,
''
he
observed
gloomily
,
pondering
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
after
all
I
am
a
man
and
not
a
louse
and
I
've
been
in
too
great
*NL*
a
hurry
to
condemn
myself
.
I
'll
make
another
fight
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
haughty
smile
appeared
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
burden
to
bear
!
And
your
whole
life
,
your
whole
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
get
used
to
it
,
''
he
said
grimly
and
thoughtfully
.
``
Listen
,
''
he
*NL*
began
a
minute
later
,
``
stop
crying
,
it
's
time
to
talk
of
the
facts
:
I
've
*NL*
come
to
tell
you
that
the
police
are
after
me
,
on
my
track
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
!
''
Sonia
cried
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
do
you
cry
out
?
You
want
me
to
go
to
Siberia
and
now
you
are
*NL*
frightened
?
But
let
me
tell
you
:
I
shall
not
give
myself
up
.
I
shall
*NL*
make
a
struggle
for
it
and
they
wo
n't
do
anything
to
me
.
They
've
no
real
*NL*
evidence
.
Yesterday
I
was
in
great
danger
and
believed
I
was
lost
;
but
*NL*
to-day
things
are
going
better
.
All
the
facts
they
know
can
be
explained
*NL*
two
ways
,
that
's
to
say
I
can
turn
their
accusations
to
my
credit
,
do
*NL*
you
understand
?
And
I
shall
,
for
I
've
learnt
my
lesson
.
But
they
will
*NL*
certainly
arrest
me
.
If
it
had
not
been
for
something
that
happened
,
*NL*
they
would
have
done
so
to-day
for
certain
;
perhaps
even
now
they
will
*NL*
arrest
me
to-day
...
But
that
's
no
matter
,
Sonia
;
they
'll
let
me
out
*NL*
again
...
for
there
is
n't
any
real
proof
against
me
,
and
there
wo
n't
be
,
*NL*
I
give
you
my
word
for
it
.
And
they
ca
n't
convict
a
man
on
what
they
*NL*
have
against
me
.
Enough
...
I
only
tell
you
that
you
may
know
...
I
will
*NL*
try
to
manage
somehow
to
put
it
to
my
mother
and
sister
so
that
they
*NL*
wo
n't
be
frightened
...
My
sister
's
future
is
secure
,
however
,
now
,
I
*NL*
believe
...
and
my
mother
's
must
be
too
...
Well
,
that
's
all
.
Be
careful
,
*NL*
though
.
Will
you
come
and
see
me
in
prison
when
I
am
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
,
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
side
by
side
,
both
mournful
and
dejected
,
as
though
they
had
*NL*
been
cast
up
by
the
tempest
alone
on
some
deserted
shore
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
Sonia
and
felt
how
great
was
her
love
for
him
,
and
strange
to
say
he
*NL*
felt
it
suddenly
burdensome
and
painful
to
be
so
loved
.
Yes
,
it
was
a
*NL*
strange
and
awful
sensation
!
On
his
way
to
see
Sonia
he
had
felt
that
*NL*
all
his
hopes
rested
on
her
;
he
expected
to
be
rid
of
at
least
part
*NL*
of
his
suffering
,
and
now
,
when
all
her
heart
turned
towards
him
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
felt
that
he
was
immeasurably
unhappier
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonia
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
'd
better
not
come
and
see
me
when
I
am
in
*NL*
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
did
not
answer
,
she
was
crying
.
Several
minutes
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
cross
on
you
?
''
she
asked
,
as
though
suddenly
thinking
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
at
first
understand
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
not
.
Here
,
take
this
one
,
of
cypress
wood
.
I
have
*NL*
another
,
a
copper
one
that
belonged
to
Lizaveta
.
I
changed
with
*NL*
Lizaveta
:
she
gave
me
her
cross
and
I
gave
her
my
little
ikon
.
I
will
*NL*
wear
Lizaveta
's
now
and
give
you
this
.
Take
it
...
it
's
mine
!
It
's
mine
,
*NL*
you
know
,
''
she
begged
him
.
``
We
will
go
to
suffer
together
,
and
together
*NL*
we
will
bear
our
cross
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
me
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
want
to
hurt
her
feelings
.
But
immediately
he
drew
back
the
*NL*
hand
he
held
out
for
the
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
,
Sonia
.
Better
later
,
''
he
added
to
comfort
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
better
,
''
she
repeated
with
conviction
,
``
when
you
go
to
meet
*NL*
your
suffering
,
then
put
it
on
.
You
will
come
to
me
,
I
'll
put
it
on
you
,
*NL*
we
will
pray
and
go
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
someone
knocked
three
times
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
may
I
come
in
?
''
they
heard
in
a
very
familiar
and
*NL*
polite
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
rushed
to
the
door
in
a
fright
.
The
flaxen
head
of
Mr.
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
appeared
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
looked
perturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
you
,
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
''
he
began
.
``
Excuse
me
...
I
thought
*NL*
I
should
find
you
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Raskolnikov
suddenly
,
``
that
is
,
*NL*
I
did
n't
mean
anything
...
of
that
sort
...
But
I
just
thought
...
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
has
gone
out
of
her
mind
,
''
he
blurted
out
suddenly
,
turning
*NL*
from
Raskolnikov
to
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
it
seems
so
.
But
...
we
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
you
see
!
She
*NL*
came
back
--
she
seems
to
have
been
turned
out
somewhere
,
perhaps
*NL*
beaten
...
So
it
seems
at
least
,
...
She
had
run
to
your
father
's
former
*NL*
chief
,
she
did
n't
find
him
at
home
:
he
was
dining
at
some
other
*NL*
general
's
...
Only
fancy
,
she
rushed
off
there
,
to
the
other
general
's
,
*NL*
and
,
imagine
,
she
was
so
persistent
that
she
managed
to
get
the
chief
to
*NL*
see
her
,
had
him
fetched
out
from
dinner
,
it
seems
.
You
can
imagine
what
*NL*
happened
.
She
was
turned
out
,
of
course
;
but
,
according
to
her
own
*NL*
story
,
she
abused
him
and
threw
something
at
him
.
One
may
well
believe
*NL*
it
...
How
it
is
she
was
n't
taken
up
,
I
ca
n't
understand
!
Now
she
is
*NL*
telling
everyone
,
including
Amalia
Ivanovna
;
but
it
's
difficult
to
*NL*
understand
her
,
she
is
screaming
and
flinging
herself
about
...
Oh
yes
,
*NL*
she
shouts
that
since
everyone
has
abandoned
her
,
she
will
take
the
*NL*
children
and
go
into
the
street
with
a
barrel-organ
,
and
the
children
*NL*
will
sing
and
dance
,
and
she
too
,
and
collect
money
,
and
will
go
every
*NL*
day
under
the
general
's
window
...
`
to
let
everyone
see
well-born
*NL*
children
,
whose
father
was
an
official
,
begging
in
the
street
.
'
She
*NL*
keeps
beating
the
children
and
they
are
all
crying
.
She
is
teaching
Lida
*NL*
to
sing
`
My
Village
,
'
the
boy
to
dance
,
Polenka
the
same
.
She
is
tearing
*NL*
up
all
the
clothes
,
and
making
them
little
caps
like
actors
;
she
means
*NL*
to
carry
a
tin
basin
and
make
it
tinkle
,
instead
of
music
...
She
wo
n't
*NL*
listen
to
anything
...
Imagine
the
state
of
things
!
It
's
beyond
*NL*
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
would
have
gone
on
,
but
Sonia
,
who
had
heard
him
almost
*NL*
breathless
,
snatched
up
her
cloak
and
hat
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
putting
on
her
things
as
she
went
.
Raskolnikov
followed
her
and
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
came
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
certainly
gone
mad
!
''
he
said
to
Raskolnikov
,
as
they
went
out
*NL*
into
the
street
.
``
I
did
n't
want
to
frighten
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
so
I
said
*NL*
`
it
seemed
like
it
,
'
but
there
is
n't
a
doubt
of
it
.
They
say
that
in
*NL*
consumption
the
tubercles
sometimes
occur
in
the
brain
;
it
's
a
pity
I
*NL*
know
nothing
of
medicine
.
I
did
try
to
persuade
her
,
but
she
would
n't
*NL*
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
talk
to
her
about
the
tubercles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
precisely
of
the
tubercles
.
Besides
,
she
would
n't
have
understood
!
*NL*
But
what
I
say
is
,
that
if
you
convince
a
person
logically
that
he
*NL*
has
nothing
to
cry
about
,
he
'll
stop
crying
.
That
's
clear
.
Is
it
your
*NL*
conviction
that
he
wo
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
would
be
too
easy
if
it
were
so
,
''
answered
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
excuse
me
;
of
course
it
would
be
rather
difficult
for
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
to
understand
,
but
do
you
know
that
in
Paris
they
have
*NL*
been
conducting
serious
experiments
as
to
the
possibility
of
curing
the
*NL*
insane
,
simply
by
logical
argument
?
One
professor
there
,
a
scientific
*NL*
man
of
standing
,
lately
dead
,
believed
in
the
possibility
of
such
*NL*
treatment
.
His
idea
was
that
there
's
nothing
really
wrong
with
the
*NL*
physical
organism
of
the
insane
,
and
that
insanity
is
,
so
to
say
,
a
*NL*
logical
mistake
,
an
error
of
judgment
,
an
incorrect
view
of
things
.
He
*NL*
gradually
showed
the
madman
his
error
and
,
would
you
believe
it
,
they
*NL*
say
he
was
successful
?
But
as
he
made
use
of
douches
too
,
how
far
*NL*
success
was
due
to
that
treatment
remains
uncertain
...
So
it
seems
at
*NL*
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
long
ceased
to
listen
.
Reaching
the
house
where
he
*NL*
lived
,
he
nodded
to
Lebeziatnikov
and
went
in
at
the
gate
.
Lebeziatnikov
*NL*
woke
up
with
a
start
,
looked
about
him
and
hurried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
into
his
little
room
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
it
.
Why
had
he
come
back
here
?
He
looked
at
the
yellow
and
tattered
*NL*
paper
,
at
the
dust
,
at
his
sofa
...
From
the
yard
came
a
loud
continuous
*NL*
knocking
;
someone
seemed
to
be
hammering
...
He
went
to
the
window
,
rose
*NL*
on
tiptoe
and
looked
out
into
the
yard
for
a
long
time
with
an
air
of
*NL*
absorbed
attention
.
But
the
yard
was
empty
and
he
could
not
see
who
was
*NL*
hammering
.
In
the
house
on
the
left
he
saw
some
open
windows
;
on
the
*NL*
window-sills
were
pots
of
sickly-looking
geraniums
.
Linen
was
hung
out
*NL*
of
the
windows
...
He
knew
it
all
by
heart
.
He
turned
away
and
sat
down
*NL*
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
never
had
he
felt
himself
so
fearfully
alone
!
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
he
felt
once
more
that
he
would
perhaps
come
to
hate
Sonia
,
now
*NL*
that
he
had
made
her
more
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
had
he
gone
to
her
to
beg
for
her
tears
?
What
need
had
he
to
poison
*NL*
her
life
?
Oh
,
the
meanness
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
remain
alone
,
''
he
said
resolutely
,
``
and
she
shall
not
come
to
*NL*
the
prison
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
he
raised
his
head
with
a
strange
smile
.
That
was
a
*NL*
strange
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
really
would
be
better
in
Siberia
,
''
he
thought
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
have
said
how
long
he
sat
there
with
vague
thoughts
surging
*NL*
through
his
mind
.
All
at
once
the
door
opened
and
Dounia
came
in
.
At
*NL*
first
she
stood
still
and
looked
at
him
from
the
doorway
,
just
as
he
*NL*
had
done
at
Sonia
;
then
she
came
in
and
sat
down
in
the
same
place
*NL*
as
yesterday
,
on
the
chair
facing
him
.
He
looked
silently
and
almost
*NL*
vacantly
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
angry
,
brother
;
I
've
only
come
for
one
minute
,
''
said
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
looked
thoughtful
but
not
stern
.
Her
eyes
were
bright
and
soft
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
she
too
had
come
to
him
with
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
now
I
know
all
,
_
all
_
.
Dmitri
Prokofitch
has
explained
and
*NL*
told
me
everything
.
They
are
worrying
and
persecuting
you
through
a
*NL*
stupid
and
contemptible
suspicion
...
Dmitri
Prokofitch
told
me
that
*NL*
there
is
no
danger
,
and
that
you
are
wrong
in
looking
upon
it
with
such
*NL*
horror
.
I
do
n't
think
so
,
and
I
fully
understand
how
indignant
you
must
*NL*
be
,
and
that
that
indignation
may
have
a
permanent
effect
on
you
.
That
's
*NL*
what
I
am
afraid
of
.
As
for
your
cutting
yourself
off
from
us
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
judge
you
,
I
do
n't
venture
to
judge
you
,
and
forgive
me
for
having
*NL*
blamed
you
for
it
.
I
feel
that
I
too
,
if
I
had
so
great
a
trouble
,
*NL*
should
keep
away
from
everyone
.
I
shall
tell
mother
nothing
_
of
this
_
,
*NL*
but
I
shall
talk
about
you
continually
and
shall
tell
her
from
you
that
*NL*
you
will
come
very
soon
.
Do
n't
worry
about
her
;
_
I
_
will
set
her
mind
at
*NL*
rest
;
but
do
n't
you
try
her
too
much
--
come
once
at
least
;
remember
that
*NL*
she
is
your
mother
.
And
now
I
have
come
simply
to
say
''
-LRB-
Dounia
began
*NL*
to
get
up
-RRB-
``
that
if
you
should
need
me
or
should
need
...
all
my
life
or
*NL*
anything
...
call
me
,
and
I
'll
come
.
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
abruptly
and
went
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dounia
!
''
Raskolnikov
stopped
her
and
went
towards
her
.
``
That
Razumihin
,
*NL*
Dmitri
Prokofitch
,
is
a
very
good
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
flushed
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
she
asked
,
waiting
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
competent
,
hardworking
,
honest
and
capable
of
real
love
...
*NL*
Good-bye
,
Dounia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
flushed
crimson
,
then
suddenly
she
took
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
does
it
mean
,
brother
?
Are
we
really
parting
for
ever
that
*NL*
you
...
give
me
such
a
parting
message
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
...
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
,
and
walked
to
the
window
.
She
stood
a
moment
,
looked
at
*NL*
him
uneasily
,
and
went
out
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
he
was
not
cold
to
her
.
There
was
an
instant
-LRB-
the
very
last
one
-RRB-
*NL*
when
he
had
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
_
say
good-bye
_
to
her
,
*NL*
and
even
_
to
tell
_
her
,
but
he
had
not
dared
even
to
touch
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afterwards
she
may
shudder
when
she
remembers
that
I
embraced
her
,
and
*NL*
will
feel
that
I
stole
her
kiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
would
_
she
_
stand
that
test
?
''
he
went
on
a
few
minutes
later
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
No
,
she
would
n't
;
girls
like
that
ca
n't
stand
things
!
They
*NL*
never
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
thought
of
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
from
the
window
.
The
daylight
was
*NL*
fading
.
He
took
up
his
cap
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
,
of
course
,
and
would
not
consider
how
ill
he
was
.
But
all
*NL*
this
continual
anxiety
and
agony
of
mind
could
not
but
affect
him
.
And
*NL*
if
he
were
not
lying
in
high
fever
it
was
perhaps
just
because
this
*NL*
continual
inner
strain
helped
to
keep
him
on
his
legs
and
in
possession
*NL*
of
his
faculties
.
But
this
artificial
excitement
could
not
last
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
aimlessly
.
The
sun
was
setting
.
A
special
form
of
misery
had
*NL*
begun
to
oppress
him
of
late
.
There
was
nothing
poignant
,
nothing
acute
*NL*
about
it
;
but
there
was
a
feeling
of
permanence
,
of
eternity
about
it
;
*NL*
it
brought
a
foretaste
of
hopeless
years
of
this
cold
leaden
misery
,
a
*NL*
foretaste
of
an
eternity
``
on
a
square
yard
of
space
.
''
Towards
evening
*NL*
this
sensation
usually
began
to
weigh
on
him
more
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
idiotic
,
purely
physical
weakness
,
depending
on
the
sunset
or
*NL*
something
,
one
ca
n't
help
doing
something
stupid
!
You
'll
go
to
Dounia
,
*NL*
as
well
as
to
Sonia
,
''
he
muttered
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
his
name
called
.
He
looked
round
.
Lebeziatnikov
rushed
up
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fancy
,
I
've
been
to
your
room
looking
for
you
.
Only
fancy
,
she
's
*NL*
carried
out
her
plan
,
and
taken
away
the
children
.
Sofya
Semyonovna
and
*NL*
I
have
had
a
job
to
find
them
.
She
is
rapping
on
a
frying-pan
and
making
*NL*
the
children
dance
.
The
children
are
crying
.
They
keep
stopping
at
the
*NL*
cross-roads
and
in
front
of
shops
;
there
's
a
crowd
of
fools
running
*NL*
after
them
.
Come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Sonia
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
anxiously
,
hurrying
after
Lebeziatnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
frantic
.
That
is
,
it
's
not
Sofya
Semyonovna
's
frantic
,
but
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
,
though
Sofya
Semyonova
's
frantic
too
.
But
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
is
absolutely
frantic
.
I
tell
you
she
is
quite
mad
.
They
'll
be
*NL*
taken
to
the
police
.
You
can
fancy
what
an
effect
that
will
have
...
*NL*
They
are
on
the
canal
bank
,
near
the
bridge
now
,
not
far
from
Sofya
*NL*
Semyonovna
's
,
quite
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
canal
bank
near
the
bridge
and
not
two
houses
away
from
the
one
*NL*
where
Sonia
lodged
,
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
,
consisting
principally
*NL*
of
gutter
children
.
The
hoarse
broken
voice
of
Katerina
Ivanovna
could
*NL*
be
heard
from
the
bridge
,
and
it
certainly
was
a
strange
spectacle
*NL*
likely
to
attract
a
street
crowd
.
Katerina
Ivanovna
in
her
old
dress
*NL*
with
the
green
shawl
,
wearing
a
torn
straw
hat
,
crushed
in
a
hideous
way
*NL*
on
one
side
,
was
really
frantic
.
She
was
exhausted
and
breathless
.
Her
*NL*
wasted
consumptive
face
looked
more
suffering
than
ever
,
and
indeed
out
*NL*
of
doors
in
the
sunshine
a
consumptive
always
looks
worse
than
at
home
.
*NL*
But
her
excitement
did
not
flag
,
and
every
moment
her
irritation
grew
*NL*
more
intense
.
She
rushed
at
the
children
,
shouted
at
them
,
coaxed
*NL*
them
,
told
them
before
the
crowd
how
to
dance
and
what
to
sing
,
began
*NL*
explaining
to
them
why
it
was
necessary
,
and
driven
to
desperation
by
*NL*
their
not
understanding
,
beat
them
...
Then
she
would
make
a
rush
at
the
*NL*
crowd
;
if
she
noticed
any
decently
dressed
person
stopping
to
look
,
she
*NL*
immediately
appealed
to
him
to
see
what
these
children
``
from
a
genteel
,
*NL*
one
may
say
aristocratic
,
house
''
had
been
brought
to
.
If
she
heard
*NL*
laughter
or
jeering
in
the
crowd
,
she
would
rush
at
once
at
the
scoffers
*NL*
and
begin
squabbling
with
them
.
Some
people
laughed
,
others
shook
their
*NL*
heads
,
but
everyone
felt
curious
at
the
sight
of
the
madwoman
with
the
*NL*
frightened
children
.
The
frying-pan
of
which
Lebeziatnikov
had
spoken
*NL*
was
not
there
,
at
least
Raskolnikov
did
not
see
it
.
But
instead
of
*NL*
rapping
on
the
pan
,
Katerina
Ivanovna
began
clapping
her
wasted
hands
,
*NL*
when
she
made
Lida
and
Kolya
dance
and
Polenka
sing
.
She
too
joined
in
*NL*
the
singing
,
but
broke
down
at
the
second
note
with
a
fearful
cough
,
*NL*
which
made
her
curse
in
despair
and
even
shed
tears
.
What
made
her
most
*NL*
furious
was
the
weeping
and
terror
of
Kolya
and
Lida
.
Some
effort
had
*NL*
been
made
to
dress
the
children
up
as
street
singers
are
dressed
.
The
*NL*
boy
had
on
a
turban
made
of
something
red
and
white
to
look
like
a
Turk
.
*NL*
There
had
been
no
costume
for
Lida
;
she
simply
had
a
red
knitted
cap
,
*NL*
or
rather
a
night
cap
that
had
belonged
to
Marmeladov
,
decorated
with
*NL*
a
broken
piece
of
white
ostrich
feather
,
which
had
been
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
grandmother
's
and
had
been
preserved
as
a
family
possession
.
*NL*
Polenka
was
in
her
everyday
dress
;
she
looked
in
timid
perplexity
at
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
kept
at
her
side
,
hiding
her
tears
.
She
dimly
realised
her
*NL*
mother
's
condition
,
and
looked
uneasily
about
her
.
She
was
terribly
*NL*
frightened
of
the
street
and
the
crowd
.
Sonia
followed
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
weeping
and
beseeching
her
to
return
home
,
but
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
was
not
to
be
persuaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off
,
Sonia
,
leave
off
,
''
she
shouted
,
speaking
fast
,
panting
and
*NL*
coughing
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you
ask
;
you
are
like
a
child
!
I
've
*NL*
told
you
before
that
I
am
not
coming
back
to
that
drunken
German
.
Let
*NL*
everyone
,
let
all
Petersburg
see
the
children
begging
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
though
their
father
was
an
honourable
man
who
served
all
his
life
in
*NL*
truth
and
fidelity
,
and
one
may
say
died
in
the
service
.
''
-LRB-
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
had
by
now
invented
this
fantastic
story
and
thoroughly
*NL*
believed
it
.
-RRB-
``
Let
that
wretch
of
a
general
see
it
!
And
you
are
silly
,
*NL*
Sonia
:
what
have
we
to
eat
?
Tell
me
that
.
We
have
worried
you
enough
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
go
on
so
!
Ah
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
is
that
you
?
''
she
cried
,
seeing
*NL*
Raskolnikov
and
rushing
up
to
him
.
``
Explain
to
this
silly
girl
,
please
,
*NL*
that
nothing
better
could
be
done
!
Even
organ-grinders
earn
their
*NL*
living
,
and
everyone
will
see
at
once
that
we
are
different
,
that
we
are
*NL*
an
honourable
and
bereaved
family
reduced
to
beggary
.
And
that
general
*NL*
will
lose
his
post
,
you
'll
see
!
We
shall
perform
under
his
windows
every
*NL*
day
,
and
if
the
Tsar
drives
by
,
I
'll
fall
on
my
knees
,
put
the
children
*NL*
before
me
,
show
them
to
him
,
and
say
`
Defend

'
He
is
the
*NL*
father
of
the
fatherless
,
he
is
merciful
,
he
'll
protect
us

you
'll
*NL*
see

wretch
of
a
general

'll
dance
again

Why
are
you
whimpering
?
Whimpering
again
!
What
*NL*
are
you
afraid
of
,
stupid
?
Goodness
,
what
am
I
to
do
with
them
,
Rodion
*NL*
Romanovitch
?
If
you
only
knew
how
stupid
they
are
!
What
's
one
to
do
with
*NL*
such
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
,
almost
crying
herself
--
which
did
not
stop
her
uninterrupted
,
*NL*
rapid
flow
of
talk
--
pointed
to
the
crying
children
.
Raskolnikov
tried
*NL*
to
persuade
her
to
go
home
,
and
even
said
,
hoping
to
work
on
her
vanity
,
*NL*
that
it
was
unseemly
for
her
to
be
wandering
about
the
streets
like
*NL*
an
organ-grinder
,
as
she
was
intending
to
become
the
principal
of
a
*NL*
boarding-school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
boarding-school
,
ha-ha-ha
!
A
castle
in
the
air

cried
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
her
laugh
ending
in
a
cough
.
``
No

Rodion
Romanovitch

that
*NL*

All

And

You
know

*NL*
Rodion
Romanovitch

I
threw
an
inkpot
at
him

it
happened
to
be
standing
*NL*
in
the
waiting-room
by
the
paper
where
you
sign
your

I
wrote
my

threw

ran
away

scoundrels

to
Sonia

blockhead
laughing
*NL*
at

-LRB-
She
pointed
to
a
man
in
the
crowd
.
-RRB-
``
It
's
all

Kolya

do

Tell
me

Rodion

find

something

sing

get
money

something
Kolya
can
dance
to

For
,
*NL*
as
you
can
fancy
,
our
performance
is
all
impromptu

We
must
talk
it
*NL*
over
and
rehearse
it
all
thoroughly
,
and
then
we
shall
go
to
Nevsky
,
*NL*
where
there
are
far
more
people
of
good
society
,
and
we
shall
be
noticed
*NL*
at
once

Lida
knows
`
My

only
,
nothing
but
`
My

and
*NL*
everyone
sings
that

We
must
sing
something
far
more
genteel

Well

have
you
thought
of
anything

If
only
you
'd
help
your

*NL*
My

quite
gone

sing

see
at

that
you

that
will
be
much

more

You
might
sing
`
Marlborough

*NL*
for
that
's
quite

*NL*
A
policeman
was
indeed
forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
.
But
at
that
*NL*
moment
a
gentleman
in
civilian
uniform
and
an
overcoat
--
a
solid-looking
*NL*
official
of
about
fifty
with
a
decoration
on
his
neck
-LRB-
which
delighted
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
had
its
effect
on
the
policeman
-RRB-
--
approached
and
*NL*
without
a
word
handed
her
a
green
three-rouble
note
.
His
face
wore
*NL*
a
look
of
genuine
sympathy

Katerina
Ivanovna
took
it
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
polite
,
even
ceremonious
,
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Kolya

scared

their

mad
pranks

suddenly
seized
each

by
the
hand

and
ran
off
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
the

wanted
to
take

away
somewhere

*NL*
Weeping

wailing

poor
Katerina

ran
after

She
was

a
piteous

unseemly
spectacle

ran

weeping

panting
for

Sonia

down

*NL*
``

cried
Sonia
,
bending
over
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
ran
up
and
crowded
around
.
Raskolnikov
and
Lebeziatnikov
were
the
*NL*
first
at
her
side
,
the
official
too
hastened
up
,
and
behind
him
the
*NL*
policeman
who
muttered
,
``
Bother

''
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
,
feeling
*NL*
that
the
job
was
going
to
be
a
troublesome
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass

he
said
to
the

pressed
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

someone
shouted

*NL*
*NL*
When
they
examined
Katerina
Ivanovna
carefully
,
they
saw
that
she
had
*NL*
not
cut
herself
against
a
stone
,
as
Sonia
thought
,
but
that
the
blood
*NL*
that
stained
the
pavement
red
was
from
her
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
that
before

muttered
the
official
to
Raskolnikov
and
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
;
``
that

consumption
;
the

flows

chokes

nearly

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

this

Sonia
implored

``

she
turned
*NL*
from
one
to
the
other
.
``
Send
for
the
doctor

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
official
's
efforts
,
this
plan
was
adopted
,
the
policeman
*NL*
even
helping
to
carry
Katerina
Ivanovna
.
She
was
carried
to
Sonia
's
*NL*
room
,
almost
unconscious
,
and
laid
on
the
bed
.
The
blood
was
still
*NL*
flowing
,
but
she
seemed
to
be
coming
to
herself
.
Raskolnikov
,
*NL*
Lebeziatnikov
,
and
the
official
accompanied
Sonia
into
the
room
and
were
*NL*
followed
by
the
policeman
,
who
first
drove
back
the
crowd
which
followed
*NL*
to
the
very
door
.
Polenka
came
in
holding
Kolya
and
Lida
,
who
*NL*
were
trembling
and
weeping
.
Several
persons
came
in
too
from
the
*NL*
Kapernaumovs
'
room
;
the
landlord
,
a
lame
one-eyed
man
of
strange
*NL*
appearance
with
whiskers
and
hair
that
stood
up
like
a
brush
,
his
*NL*
wife
,
a
woman
with
an
everlastingly
scared
expression
,
and
several
*NL*
open-mouthed
children
with
wonder-struck
faces
.
Among
these
,
*NL*
Svidrigailov
suddenly
made
his
appearance
.
Raskolnikov
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
surprise
,
not
understanding
where
he
had
come
from
and
not
having
*NL*
noticed
him
in
the
crowd
.
A
doctor
and
priest
wore
spoken
of
.
The
*NL*
official
whispered
to
Raskolnikov
that
he
thought
it
was
too
late
now
*NL*
for
the
doctor
,
but
he
ordered
him
to
be
sent
for
.
Kapernaumov
ran
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Katerina
Ivanovna
had
regained
her
breath
.
The
bleeding
ceased
*NL*
for
a
time
.
She
looked
with
sick
but
intent
and
penetrating
eyes
at
*NL*
Sonia
,
who
stood
pale
and
trembling
,
wiping
the
sweat
from
her
brow
with
*NL*
a
handkerchief
.
At
last
she
asked
to
be
raised
.
They
sat
her
up
on
the
*NL*
bed
,
supporting
her
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
children
?
''
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
.
``
You
've
brought
*NL*
them

Polenka
?
Oh
the
sillies
!
Why
did
you
run
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
her
parched
lips
were
covered
with
blood
.
She
moved
her
eyes
,
*NL*
looking
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
how
you
live
,

once

I
been

She
looked
at
her
with
a
face
of
suffering
.

``

laid
her
back
on
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

the
priest
?
I

*NL*
She
sank
more
and
more
into
uneasy
delirium
.
At
times
she
shuddered
,
*NL*
turned
her
eyes
from
side
to
side
,
recognised
everyone
for
a
minute
,
*NL*
but
at
once
sank
into
delirium
again

Her
breathing
was
hoarse
and
*NL*
difficult

there
was
a
sort
of
rattle
in
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

She
was
violently

tried
to
sit
up

At

,
in
a
horribly
*NL*
hoarse

broken
voice

she
began
,
shrieking
and
gasping
at
every

at

recognised

there

up

*NL*
she
cried
with
vindictive
despair
,
and
her
head
fell
heavily
back
on
the
*NL*
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
into
unconsciousness
again
,
but
this
time
it
did
not
last
long

*NL*
Her
pale
,
yellow
,
wasted
face
dropped
back

her
mouth
fell
open

her
leg
*NL*
moved
convulsively

she
gave
a

deep
sigh

died

*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
fell
upon

,
flung
her
arms
about
her
,
and
remained
motionless
*NL*
with
her
head
pressed
to
the
dead

wasted
bosom

Polenka
threw
*NL*
herself
at
her
mother

feet

kissing
them
and
weeping
violently
.
Though

Kolya
and
Lida
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
,
they
had
a
feeling
*NL*
that
it
was
something
terrible
;
they
put
their
hands
on
each
other

*NL*
little
shoulders
,
stared
straight
at
one
another
and
both
at
once
opened

their

began
screaming

They
were
both
still

their

one
in

the

in

And
how
did
``

come

Katerina

It
lay
there
by

pillow

Raskolnikov
saw
it

He
walked
away

up

*NL*
it
's
a
question
of
money
and
,
as
I
told
you
,
I
have
plenty
to
spare
.
I
*NL*
will
put
those
two
little
ones
and
Polenka
into
some
good
orphan
asylum
,
*NL*
and
I
will
settle
fifteen
hundred
roubles
to
be
paid
to
each
on
coming
*NL*
of
age
,
so
that
Sofya
Semyonovna
need
have
no
anxiety
about
them
.
And
I
*NL*
will
pull
her
out
of
the
mud
too
,
for
she
is
a
good
girl
,
is
n't
she
?
So
*NL*
tell
Avdotya
Romanovna
that
that
is
how
I
am
spending
her
ten
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
motive
for
such
benevolence
?
''
asked
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
sceptical
person
!
''
laughed
Svidrigailov
.
``
I
told
you
I
had
no
*NL*
need
of
that
money
.
Wo
n't
you
admit
that
it
's
simply
done
from
humanity
?
*NL*
She
was
n't
'
a
louse
,
'
you
know
''
-LRB-
he
pointed
to
the
corner
where
the
*NL*
dead
woman
lay
-RRB-
,
``
was
she
,
like
some
old
pawnbroker
woman
?
Come
,
you
'll
*NL*
agree
,
is
Luzhin
to
go
on
living
,
and
doing
wicked
things
or
is
she
to
*NL*
die
?
And
if
I
did
n't
help
them
,
Polenka
would
go
the
same
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
with
an
air
of
a
sort
of
gay
winking
slyness
,
keeping
his
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
Raskolnikov
,
who
turned
white
and
cold
,
hearing
his
own
*NL*
phrases
,
spoken
to
Sonia
.
He
quickly
stepped
back
and
looked
wildly
at
*NL*
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
he
whispered
,
hardly
able
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
lodge
here
at
Madame
Resslich
's
,
the
other
side
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
Here
is
Kapernaumov
,
and
there
lives
Madame
Resslich
,
an
old
and
devoted
*NL*
friend
of
mine
.
I
am
a
neighbour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
continued
Svidrigailov
,
shaking
with
laughter
.
``
I
assure
you
*NL*
on
my
honour
,
dear
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
that
you
have
interested
me
*NL*
enormously
.
I
told
you
we
should
become
friends
,
I
foretold
it
.
Well
,
*NL*
here
we
have
.
And
you
will
see
what
an
accommodating

I
am

You

get
on
with

PART
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
period
began
for
Raskolnikov
:
it
was
as
though
a
fog
had
*NL*
fallen
upon
him
and
wrapped
him
in
a
dreary
solitude
from
which
there
*NL*
was
no
escape
.
Recalling
that
period
long
after
,
he
believed
that
his
*NL*
mind
had
been
clouded
at
times
,
and
that
it
had
continued
so
,
with
*NL*
intervals
,
till
the
final
catastrophe
.
He
was
convinced
that
he
had
been
*NL*
mistaken
about
many
things
at
that
time
,
for
instance
as
to
the
date
*NL*
of
certain
events
.
Anyway
,
when
he
tried
later
on
to
piece
his
*NL*
recollections
together
,
he
learnt
a
great
deal
about
himself
from
what
*NL*
other
people
told
him
.
He
had
mixed
up
incidents
and
had
explained
*NL*
events
as
due
to
circumstances
which
existed
only
in
his
imagination
.
At
*NL*
times
he
was
a
prey
to
agonies
of
morbid
uneasiness
,
amounting
sometimes
*NL*
to
panic
.
But
he
remembered
,
too
,
moments
,
hours
,
perhaps
whole
days
,
*NL*
of
complete
apathy
,
which
came
upon
him
as
a
reaction
from
his
previous
*NL*
terror
and
might
be
compared
with
the
abnormal
insensibility
,
sometimes
*NL*
seen
in
the
dying
.
He
seemed
to
be
trying
in
that
latter
stage
to
escape
*NL*
from
a
full
and
clear
understanding
of
his
position
.
Certain
essential
*NL*
facts
which
required
immediate
consideration
were
particularly
irksome
*NL*
to
him
.
How
glad
he
would
have
been
to
be
free
from
some
cares
,
the
*NL*
neglect
of
which
would
have
threatened
him
with
complete
,
inevitable
*NL*
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
particularly
worried
about
Svidrigailov
,
he
might
be
said
to
be
*NL*
permanently
thinking
of
Svidrigailov
.
From
the
time
of
Svidrigailov
's
*NL*
too
menacing
and
unmistakable
words
in
Sonia
's
room
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
death
,
the
normal
working
of
his
mind
seemed
to
*NL*
break
down
.
But
although
this
new
fact
caused
him
extreme
uneasiness
,
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
in
no
hurry
for
an
explanation
of
it
.
At
times
,
finding
*NL*
himself
in
a
solitary
and
remote
part
of
the
town
,
in
some
wretched
*NL*
eating-house
,
sitting
alone
lost
in
thought
,
hardly
knowing
how
he
had
*NL*
come
there
,
he
suddenly
thought
of
Svidrigailov
.
He
recognised
*NL*
suddenly
,
clearly
,
and
with
dismay
that
he
ought
at
once
to
come
to
an
*NL*
understanding
with
that
man
and
to
make
what
terms
he
could
.
Walking
*NL*
outside
the
city
gates
one
day
,
he
positively
fancied
that
they
had
*NL*
fixed
a
meeting
there
,
that
he
was
waiting
for
Svidrigailov
.
Another
*NL*
time
he
woke
up
before
daybreak
lying
on
the
ground
under
some
bushes
*NL*
and
could
not
at
first
understand
how
he
had
come
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
during
the
two
or
three
days
after
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
death
,
he
*NL*
had
two
or
three
times
met
Svidrigailov
at
Sonia
's
lodging
,
where
he
*NL*
had
gone
aimlessly
for
a
moment
.
They
exchanged
a
few
words
and
made
no
*NL*
reference
to
the
vital
subject
,
as
though
they
were
tacitly
agreed
not
*NL*
to
speak
of
it
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
body
was
still
lying
in
the
coffin
,
Svidrigailov
was
*NL*
busy
making
arrangements
for
the
funeral
.
Sonia
too
was
very
busy
.
At
*NL*
their
last
meeting
Svidrigailov
informed
Raskolnikov
that
he
had
made
*NL*
an
arrangement
,
and
a
very
satisfactory
one
,
for
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
children
;
that
he
had
,
through
certain
connections
,
succeeded
in
getting
*NL*
hold
of
certain
personages
by
whose
help
the
three
orphans
could
be
at
*NL*
once
placed
in
very
suitable
institutions
;
that
the
money
he
had
settled
*NL*
on
them
had
been
of
great
assistance
,
as
it
is
much
easier
to
place
*NL*
orphans
with
some
property
than
destitute
ones
.
He
said
something
*NL*
too
about
Sonia
and
promised
to
come
himself
in
a
day
or
two
to
see
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
mentioning
that
``
he
would
like
to
consult
with
him
,
that
*NL*
there
were
things
they
must
talk
over
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
took
place
in
the
passage
on
the
stairs
.
Svidrigailov
*NL*
looked
intently
at
Raskolnikov
and
suddenly
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
*NL*
dropping
his
voice
,
asked
:
``
But
how
is
it
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
;
you
*NL*
do
n't
seem
yourself
?
You
look
and
you
listen
,
but
you
do
n't
seem
to
*NL*
understand
.
Cheer
up
!
We
'll
talk
things
over
;
I
am
only
sorry
,
I
've
*NL*
so
much
to
do
of
my
own
business
and
other
people
's
.
Ah
,
Rodion
*NL*
Romanovitch
,
''
he
added
suddenly
,
``
what
all
men
need
is
fresh
air
,
fresh
*NL*
air
...
more
than
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
to
one
side
to
make
way
for
the
priest
and
server
,
who
*NL*
were
coming
up
the
stairs
.
They
had
come
for
the
requiem
service
.
By
*NL*
Svidrigailov
's
orders
it
was
sung
twice
a
day
punctually
.
Svidrigailov
*NL*
went
his
way
.
Raskolnikov
stood
still
a
moment
,
thought
,
and
followed
*NL*
the
priest
into
Sonia
's
room
.
He
stood
at
the
door
.
They
began
quietly
,
*NL*
slowly
and
mournfully
singing
the
service
.
From
his
childhood
the
*NL*
thought
of
death
and
the
presence
of
death
had
something
oppressive
*NL*
and
mysteriously
awful
;
and
it
was
long
since
he
had
heard
the
requiem
*NL*
service
.
And
there
was
something
else
here
as
well
,
too
awful
and
*NL*
disturbing
.
He
looked
at
the
children
:
they
were
all
kneeling
by
the
*NL*
coffin
;
Polenka
was
weeping
.
Behind
them
Sonia
prayed
,
softly
and
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
timidly
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
last
two
days
she
has
n't
said
a
word
to
me
,
she
has
n't
glanced
at
*NL*
me
,
''
Raskolnikov
thought
suddenly
.
The
sunlight
was
bright
in
the
room
;
*NL*
the
incense
rose
in
clouds
;
the
priest
read
,
``
Give
rest
,
oh
Lord
...
''
*NL*
Raskolnikov
stayed
all
through
the
service
.
As
he
blessed
them
and
*NL*
took
his
leave
,
the
priest
looked
round
strangely
.
After
the
service
,
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
up
to
Sonia
.
She
took
both
his
hands
and
let
her
*NL*
head
sink
on
his
shoulder
.
This
slight
friendly
gesture
bewildered
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
It
seemed
strange
to
him
that
there
was
no
trace
of
*NL*
repugnance
,
no
trace
of
disgust
,
no
tremor
in
her
hand
.
It
was
the
*NL*
furthest
limit
of
self-abnegation
,
at
least
so
he
interpreted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
said
nothing
.
Raskolnikov
pressed
her
hand
and
went
out
.
He
felt
*NL*
very
miserable
.
If
it
had
been
possible
to
escape
to
some
solitude
,
he
*NL*
would
have
thought
himself
lucky
,
even
if
he
had
to
spend
his
whole
life
*NL*
there
.
But
although
he
had
almost
always
been
by
himself
of
late
,
he
had
*NL*
never
been
able
to
feel
alone
.
Sometimes
he
walked
out
of
the
town
on
to
*NL*
the
high
road
,
once
he
had
even
reached
a
little
wood
,
but
the
lonelier
*NL*
the
place
was
,
the
more
he
seemed
to
be
aware
of
an
uneasy
presence
near
*NL*
him
.
It
did
not
frighten
him
,
but
greatly
annoyed
him
,
so
that
he
*NL*
made
haste
to
return
to
the
town
,
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
,
to
enter
*NL*
restaurants
and
taverns
,
to
walk
in
busy
thoroughfares
.
There
he
felt
*NL*
easier
and
even
more
solitary
.
One
day
at
dusk
he
sat
for
an
hour
*NL*
listening
to
songs
in
a
tavern
and
he
remembered
that
he
positively
*NL*
enjoyed
it
.
But
at
last
he
had
suddenly
felt
the
same
uneasiness
again
,
*NL*
as
though
his
conscience
smote
him
.
``
Here
I
sit
listening
to
singing
,
*NL*
is
that
what
I
ought
to
be
doing
?
''
he
thought
.
Yet
he
felt
at
once
*NL*
that
that
was
not
the
only
cause
of
his
uneasiness
;
there
was
something
*NL*
requiring
immediate
decision
,
but
it
was
something
he
could
not
clearly
*NL*
understand
or
put
into
words
.
It
was
a
hopeless
tangle
.
``
No
,
better
the
*NL*
struggle
again
!
Better
Porfiry
again
...
or
Svidrigailov
...
Better
some
*NL*
challenge
again
...
some
attack
.
Yes
,
yes
!
''
he
thought
.
He
went
out
of
*NL*
the
tavern
and
rushed
away
almost
at
a
run
.
The
thought
of
Dounia
and
*NL*
his
mother
suddenly
reduced
him
almost
to
a
panic
.
That
night
he
woke
*NL*
up
before
morning
among
some
bushes
in
Krestovsky
Island
,
trembling
*NL*
all
over
with
fever
;
he
walked
home
,
and
it
was
early
morning
when
he
*NL*
arrived
.
After
some
hours
'
sleep
the
fever
left
him
,
but
he
woke
up
*NL*
late
,
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
that
Katerina
Ivanovna
's
funeral
had
been
fixed
for
that
*NL*
day
,
and
was
glad
that
he
was
not
present
at
it
.
Nastasya
brought
him
*NL*
some
food
;
he
ate
and
drank
with
appetite
,
almost
with
greediness
.
His
*NL*
head
was
fresher
and
he
was
calmer
than
he
had
been
for
the
last
three
*NL*
days
.
He
even
felt
a
passing
wonder
at
his
previous
attacks
of
panic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
and
Razumihin
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
's
eating
,
then
he
's
not
ill
,
''
said
Razumihin
.
He
took
a
chair
*NL*
and
sat
down
at
the
table
opposite
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
troubled
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
.
He
spoke
with
evident
*NL*
annoyance
,
but
without
hurry
or
raising
his
voice
.
He
looked
as
though
*NL*
he
had
some
special
fixed
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
he
began
resolutely
.
``
As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
you
may
all
go
*NL*
to
hell
,
but
from
what
I
see
,
it
's
clear
to
me
that
I
ca
n't
make
head
or
*NL*
tail
of
it
;
please
do
n't
think
I
've
come
to
ask
you
questions
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
know
,
hang
it
!
If
you
begin
telling
me
your
secrets
,
I
dare
say
*NL*
I
should
n't
stay
to
listen
,
I
should
go
away
cursing
.
I
have
only
come
*NL*
to
find
out
once
for
all
whether
it
's
a
fact
that
you
are
mad
?
There
is
*NL*
a
conviction
in
the
air
that
you
are
mad
or
very
nearly
so
.
I
admit
*NL*
I
've
been
disposed
to
that
opinion
myself
,
judging
from
your
stupid
,
*NL*
repulsive
and
quite
inexplicable
actions
,
and
from
your
recent
behavior
*NL*
to
your
mother
and
sister
.
Only
a
monster
or
a
madman
could
treat
them
*NL*
as
you
have
;
so
you
must
be
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
see
them
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
.
Have
n't
you
seen
them
since
then
?
What
have
you
been
doing
*NL*
with
yourself
?
Tell
me
,
please
.
I
've
been
to
you
three
times
already
.
*NL*
Your
mother
has
been
seriously
ill
since
yesterday
.
She
had
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
to
come
to
you
;
Avdotya
Romanovna
tried
to
prevent
her
;
she
*NL*
would
n't
hear
a
word
.
`
If
he
is
ill
,
if
his
mind
is
giving
way
,
who
can
*NL*
look
after
him
like
his
mother
?
'
she
said
.
We
all
came
here
together
,
we
*NL*
could
n't
let
her
come
alone
all
the
way
.
We
kept
begging
her
to
be
calm

*NL*
We
came
in
,
you
were
n't
here
;
she
sat
down
,
and
stayed
ten
minutes
,
*NL*
while
we
stood
waiting
in
silence
.
She
got
up
and
said
:
`
If
he
's
*NL*
gone
out
,
that
is
,
if
he
is
well
,
and
has
forgotten
his
mother
,
it
's
*NL*
humiliating
and
unseemly
for
his
mother
to
stand
at
his
door
begging
for
*NL*
kindness
.
'
She
returned
home
and
took
to
her
bed
;
now
she
is
in
a
fever
.
*NL*
'
I
see
,
'
she
said
,
`
that
he
has
time
for
_
his
girl
_
.
'
She
means
by
_
your
*NL*
girl
_
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
your
betrothed
or
your
mistress
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
*NL*
went
at
once
to
Sofya
Semyonovna
's
,
for
I
wanted
to
know
what
was
going
*NL*
on
.
I
looked
round
,
I
saw
the
coffin
,
the
children
crying
,
and
*NL*
Sofya
Semyonovna
trying
them
on
mourning
dresses
.
No
sign
of
you
.
I
*NL*
apologised
,
came
away
,
and
reported
to
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
So
that
's
all
*NL*
nonsense
and
you
have
n't
got
a
girl
;
the
most
likely
thing
is
that
you
*NL*
are
mad
.
But
here
you
sit
,
guzzling
boiled
beef
as
though
you
'd
not
had
*NL*
a
bite
for
three
days
.
Though
as
far
as
that
goes
,
madmen
eat
too
,
but
*NL*
though
you
have
not
said
a
word
to
me
yet
...
you
are
not
mad
!
That
I
'd
*NL*
swear
!
Above
all
,
you
are
not
mad
!
So
you
may
go
to
hell
,
all
of
you
,
*NL*
for
there
's
some
mystery
,
some
secret
about
it
,
and
I
do
n't
intend
to
*NL*
worry
my
brains
over
your
secrets
.
So
I
've
simply
come
to
swear
at
you
,
''
*NL*
he
finished
,
getting
up
,
``
to
relieve
my
mind
.
And
I
know
what
to
do
*NL*
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you

``
Why

Razumihin
paused
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always

observed
suddenly
with
warmth

he
moved
to
go
out

*NL*
Razumihin
stopped
short
and
even
turned
a
little
pale

*NL*
*NL*
One
could
see
that
his

was
throbbing
slowly

violently

about

*NL*
*NL*

I
told
her
you
were
a
very
good

industrious

I
did

*NL*
``
She

*NL*
``
Well

it

pretty
plain

Wherever
I

whatever
happened

you

remain
to
look
after

I

so
to
speak

give
them
into

*NL*
*NL*
Razumihin
stood
lost
in
thought
and
excitement
,
making
a
silent
*NL*
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
political
conspirator

He
must
be

And
he
's
on

's
certain

It
can
only
be
that

And

Dounia

knows

he
thought
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
Avdotya
Romanovna
comes
to
see
you

he
said
,
weighing
each
*NL*
syllable
,
``

you
're
going
to
see
a
man

says
we
need
more
air

so

that
letter

that
too
must
have
something
to
do
with
it

*NL*
he
concluded
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
got
a
letter
to-day

It
upset
her
very

Too

I
began
speaking
of
you

she
begged
me
not
to

Then
...
then
*NL*
she
said
that
perhaps
we
should
very
soon
have
to
part

then
she
began
*NL*
warmly
thanking
me
for
something
;
then
she
went
to
her
room

locked

herself
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

Raskolnikov
asked
thoughtfully

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
out
;
but
when
he
had
almost
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
opened
it
again
,
and
said
,
looking
away
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
do
you
remember
that
murder

you
know
Porfiry

,
that
*NL*
old
woman
?
Do
you
know
the
murderer
has
been
found
,
he
has
confessed
*NL*
and
given
the
proofs
.
It
's
one
of
those
very
workmen
,
the
painter
,
only
*NL*
fancy
!
Do
you
remember
I
defended
them
here
?
Would
you
believe
it
,
all
*NL*
that
scene
of
fighting
and
laughing
with
his
companions
on
the
stairs
*NL*
while
the
porter
and
the
two
witnesses
were
going
up
,
he
got
up
on
*NL*
purpose
to
disarm
suspicion
.
The
cunning
,
the
presence
of
mind
of
the
*NL*
young
dog
!
One
can
hardly
credit
it
;
but
it
's
his
own
explanation
,
he
*NL*
has
confessed
it
all
.
And
what
a
fool
I
was
about
it
!
Well
,
he
's
simply
*NL*
a
genius
of
hypocrisy
and
resourcefulness
in
disarming
the
suspicions
of
*NL*
the
lawyers
--
so
there
's
nothing
much
to
wonder
at
,
I
suppose
!
Of
course
*NL*
people
like
that
are
always
possible
.
And
the
fact
that
he
could
n't
keep
*NL*
up
the
character
,
but
confessed
,
makes
him
easier
to
believe
in
.
But
*NL*
what
a
fool
I
was
!
I
was
frantic
on
their
side
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me

did
you
hear

Raskolnikov
asked
with
unmistakable
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
You
ask
me

went
out

``
He
's
a

's
not

Razumihin

decided
,
as
he
slowly
descended
the
stairs

drawn
his

quite
in

's
character

*NL*
There
are
interviews
between
them

She
hinted
at
it
too

So
many
of
*NL*
her
words
...
and
hints
...
bear
that
meaning
!
And
how
else
can
all
this
*NL*
tangle
be
explained
?
Hm

And
I
was
almost
thinking

Good
heavens
,
*NL*
what
I
thought
!
Yes
,
I
took
leave
of
my
senses
and
I
wronged
him

It
was
*NL*
his
doing
,
under
the
lamp
in
the
corridor
that
day
.
Pfoo
!
What
a
crude
,
*NL*
nasty
,
vile
idea
on
my
part
!
Nikolay
is
a
brick
,
for
confessing
...
And
*NL*
how
clear
it
all
is
now

His
illness
then

all
his
strange
actions

*NL*
before
this
,
in
the
university
,
how
morose
he
used
to
be
,
how
gloomy

But
what
's
the
meaning
now
of
that
letter
?
There
's
something
in
that
,
*NL*
too
,
perhaps
.
Whom
was
it
from
?
I
suspect
...
!
No
,
I
must
find
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
Dounia
,
realising
all
he
had
heard
and
his
heart
throbbed
,
*NL*
and
he
suddenly
broke
into
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Razumihin
went
out
,
Raskolnikov
got
up
,
turned
to
the
window
,
*NL*
walked
into
one
corner
and
then
into
another
,
as
though
forgetting
the
*NL*
smallness
of
his
room
,
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
.
He
felt
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
renewed
;
again
the
struggle
,
so
a
means
of
escape
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
means
of
escape
had
come
!
It
had
been
too
stifling
,
too
*NL*
cramping
,
the
burden
had
been
too
agonising
.
A
lethargy
had
come
upon
*NL*
him
at
times
.
From
the
moment
of
the
scene
with
Nikolay
at
Porfiry
's
he
*NL*
had
been
suffocating
,
penned
in
without
hope
of
escape
.
After
Nikolay
's
*NL*
confession
,
on
that
very
day
had
come
the
scene
with
Sonia
;
his
*NL*
behaviour
and
his
last
words
had
been
utterly
unlike
anything
he
*NL*
could
have
imagined
beforehand
;
he
had
grown
feebler
,
instantly
and
*NL*
fundamentally
!
And
he
had
agreed
at
the
time
with
Sonia
,
he
had
agreed
*NL*
in
his
heart
he
could
not
go
on
living
alone
with
such
a
thing
on
his
*NL*
mind
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Svidrigailov
was
a
riddle
...
He
worried
him
,
that
was
true
,
but
*NL*
somehow
not
on
the
same
point
.
He
might
still
have
a
struggle
to
come
*NL*
with
Svidrigailov
.
Svidrigailov
,
too
,
might
be
a
means
of
escape
;
but
*NL*
Porfiry
was
a
different
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
Porfiry
himself
had
explained
it
to
Razumihin
,
had
explained
it
*NL*
_
psychologically
_
.
He
had
begun
bringing
in
his
damned
psychology
again
!
*NL*
Porfiry
?
But
to
think
that
Porfiry
should
for
one
moment
believe
that
*NL*
Nikolay
was
guilty
,
after
what
had
passed
between
them
before
Nikolay
's
*NL*
appearance
,
after
that
tete-a-tete
interview
,
which
could
have
only
*NL*
_
one
_
explanation
?
-LRB-
During
those
days
Raskolnikov
had
often
recalled
*NL*
passages
in
that
scene
with
Porfiry
;
he
could
not
bear
to
let
his
mind
*NL*
rest
on
it
.
-RRB-
Such
words
,
such
gestures
had
passed
between
them
,
they
*NL*
had
exchanged
such
glances
,
things
had
been
said
in
such
a
tone
and
had
*NL*
reached
such
a
pass
,
that
Nikolay
,
whom
Porfiry
had
seen
through
at
the
*NL*
first
word
,
at
the
first
gesture
,
could
not
have
shaken
his
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
think
that
even
Razumihin
had
begun
to
suspect
!
The
scene
in
the
*NL*
corridor
under
the
lamp
had
produced
its
effect
then
.
He
had
rushed
to
*NL*
Porfiry
...
But
what
had
induced
the
latter
to
receive
him
like
that
?
*NL*
What
had
been
his
object
in
putting
Razumihin
off
with
Nikolay
?
He
must
*NL*
have
some
plan
;
there
was
some
design
,
but
what
was
it
?
It
was
true
that
*NL*
a
long
time
had
passed
since
that
morning
--
too
long
a
time
--
and
no
sight
*NL*
nor
sound
of
Porfiry

Well
,
that
was
a
bad
sign

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
took
his
cap
and
went
out
of
the
room
,
still
pondering
.
It
*NL*
was
the
first
time
for
a
long
while
that
he
had
felt
clear
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
at
least
.
``
I
must
settle
Svidrigailov
,
''
he
thought
,
``
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
;
he
,
too
,
seems
to
be
waiting
for
me
to
come
to
him
of
my
own
*NL*
accord
.
''
And
at
that
moment
there
was
such
a
rush
of
hate
in
his
*NL*
weary
heart
that
he
might
have
killed
either
of
those
two
--
Porfiry
or
*NL*
Svidrigailov
.
At
least
he
felt
that
he
would
be
capable
of
doing
it
*NL*
later
,
if
not
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
,
we
shall
see
,
''
he
repeated
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
sooner
had
he
opened
the
door
than
he
stumbled
upon
Porfiry
*NL*
himself
in
the
passage
.
He
was
coming
in
to
see
him
.
Raskolnikov
was
*NL*
dumbfounded
for
a
minute
,
but
only
for
one
minute
.
Strange
to
say
,
he
*NL*
was
not
very
much
astonished
at
seeing
Porfiry
and
scarcely
afraid
of
*NL*
him
.
He
was
simply
startled
,
but
was
quickly
,
instantly
,
on
his
guard
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
this
will
mean
the
end
?
But
how
could
Porfiry
have
approached
*NL*
so
quietly
,
like
a
cat
,
so
that
he
had
heard
nothing
?
Could
he
have
been
*NL*
listening
at
the
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
expect
a
visitor
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
''
Porfiry
explained
,
*NL*
laughing
.
``
I
've
been
meaning
to
look
in
a
long
time
;
I
was
passing
by
*NL*
and
thought
why
not
go
in
for
five
minutes
.
Are
you
going
out
?
I
wo
n't
*NL*
keep
you
long
.
Just
let
me
have
one
cigarette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
sit
down
.
''
Raskolnikov
gave
his
visitor
*NL*
a
seat
with
so
pleased
and
friendly
an
expression
that
he
would
have
*NL*
marvelled
at
himself
,
if
he
could
have
seen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
moment
had
come
,
the
last
drops
had
to
be
drained
!
So
a
man
*NL*
will
sometimes
go
through
half
an
hour
of
mortal
terror
with
a
brigand
,
*NL*
yet
when
the
knife
is
at
his
throat
at
last
,
he
feels
no
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
seated
himself
directly
facing
Porfiry
,
and
looked
at
him
*NL*
without
flinching
.
Porfiry
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
began
lighting
a
*NL*
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
speak
,
''
seemed
as
though
it
would
burst
from
Raskolnikov
's
*NL*
heart
.
``
Come
,
why
do
n't
you
speak
?

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
these
cigarettes
!
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
ejaculated
at
last
,
having
*NL*
lighted
one
.
``
They
are
pernicious
,
positively
pernicious
,
and
yet
I
*NL*
ca
n't
give
them
up
!
I
cough
,
I
begin
to
have
tickling
in
my
throat
and
*NL*
a
difficulty
in
breathing
.
You
know
I
am
a
coward
,
I
went
lately
to
*NL*
Dr.
B
--
n
;
he
always
gives
at
least
half
an
hour
to
each
patient
.
He
*NL*
positively
laughed
looking
at
me
;
he
sounded
me
:
`
Tobacco
's
bad
for
*NL*
you
,
'
he
said
,
`
your
lungs
are
affected
.
'
But
how
am
I
to
give
it
up
?
*NL*
What
is
there
to
take
its
place
?
I
do
n't
drink
,
that
's
the
mischief
,
*NL*
he-he-he
,
that
I
do
n't
.
Everything
is
relative
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
*NL*
everything
is
relative
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
's
playing
his
professional
tricks
again
,
''
Raskolnikov
thought
*NL*
with
disgust
.
All
the
circumstances
of
their
last
interview
suddenly
*NL*
came
back
to
him
,
and
he
felt
a
rush
of
the
feeling
that
had
come
upon
*NL*
him
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
see
you
the
day
before
yesterday
,
in
the
evening
;
you
did
n't
*NL*
know
?
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
went
on
,
looking
round
the
room
.
``
I
came
into
*NL*
this
very
room
.
I
was
passing
by
,
just
as
I
did
to-day
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
I
'd
return
your
call
.
I
walked
in
as
your
door
was
wide
open
,
I
looked
*NL*
round
,
waited
and
went
out
without
leaving
my
name
with
your
servant
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
lock
your
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
face
grew
more
and
more
gloomy
.
Porfiry
seemed
to
guess
*NL*
his
state
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
have
it
out
with
you
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
my
dear
fellow
!
*NL*
I
owe
you
an
explanation
and
must
give
it
to
you
,
''
he
continued
with
a
*NL*
slight
smile
,
just
patting
Raskolnikov
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
serious
and
careworn
look
came
into
his
*NL*
face
;
to
his
surprise
Raskolnikov
saw
a
touch
of
sadness
in
it
.
He
had
*NL*
never
seen
and
never
suspected
such
an
expression
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
strange
scene
passed
between
us
last
time
we
met
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
*NL*
Our
first
interview
,
too
,
was
a
strange
one
;
but
then
...
and
one
thing
*NL*
after
another
!
This
is
the
point
:
I
have
perhaps
acted
unfairly
to
you
;
*NL*
I
feel
it
.
Do
you
remember
how
we
parted
?
Your
nerves
were
unhinged
and
*NL*
your
knees
were
shaking
and
so
were
mine
.
And
,
you
know
,
our
behaviour
*NL*
was
unseemly
,
even
ungentlemanly
.
And
yet
we
are
gentlemen
,
above
all
,
*NL*
in
any
case
,
gentlemen
;
that
must
be
understood
.
Do
you
remember
what
we
*NL*
came
to
?
...
and
it
was
quite
indecorous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
up
to
,
what
does
he
take
me
for
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
himself
*NL*
in
amazement
,
raising
his
head
and
looking
with
open
eyes
on
Porfiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
decided
openness
is
better
between
us
,
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
went
*NL*
on
,
turning
his
head
away
and
dropping
his
eyes
,
as
though
unwilling
to
*NL*
disconcert
his
former
victim
and
as
though
disdaining
his
former
wiles
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
such
suspicions
and
such
scenes
can
not
continue
for
long
.
Nikolay
*NL*
put
a
stop
to
it
,
or
I
do
n't
know
what
we
might
not
have
come
to
.
That
*NL*
damned
workman
was
sitting
at
the
time
in
the
next
room
--
can
you
realise
*NL*
that
?
You
know
that
,
of
course
;
and
I
am
aware
that
he
came
to
you
*NL*
afterwards
.
But
what
you
supposed
then
was
not
true
:
I
had
not
sent
for
*NL*
anyone
,
I
had
made
no
kind
of
arrangements
.
You
ask
why
I
had
n't
?
What
*NL*
shall
I
say
to
you
?
it
had
all
come
upon
me
so
suddenly
.
I
had
scarcely
*NL*
sent
for
the
porters
-LRB-
you
noticed
them
as
you
went
out
,
I
dare
say
-RRB-
.
*NL*
An
idea
flashed
upon
me
;
I
was
firmly
convinced
at
the
time
,
you
see
,
*NL*
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
Come
,
I
thought
--
even
if
I
let
one
thing
slip
for
*NL*
a
time
,
I
shall
get
hold
of
something
else
--
I
sha
n't
lose
what
I
want
,
*NL*
anyway
.
You
are
nervously
irritable
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
by
temperament
;
*NL*
it
's
out
of
proportion
with
other
qualities
of
your
heart
and
character
,
*NL*
which
I
flatter
myself
I
have
to
some
extent
divined
.
Of
course
I
did
*NL*
reflect
even
then
that
it
does
not
always
happen
that
a
man
gets
up
and
*NL*
blurts
out
his
whole
story
.
It
does
happen
sometimes
,
if
you
make
a
*NL*
man
lose
all
patience
,
though
even
then
it
's
rare
.
I
was
capable
of
*NL*
realising
that
.
If
I
only
had
a
fact
,
I
thought
,
the
least
little
fact
*NL*
to
go
upon
,
something
I
could
lay
hold
of
,
something
tangible
,
not
*NL*
merely
psychological
.
For
if
a
man
is
guilty
,
you
must
be
able
to
get
*NL*
something
substantial
out
of
him
;
one
may
reckon
upon
most
surprising
*NL*
results
indeed
.
I
was
reckoning
on
your
temperament
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
*NL*
on
your
temperament
above
all
things
!
I
had
great
hopes
of
you
at
that
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
driving
at
now
?
''
Raskolnikov
muttered
at
last
,
asking
*NL*
the
question
without
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
talking
about
?
''
he
wondered
distractedly
,
``
does
he
really
*NL*
take
me
to
be
innocent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
driving
at
?
I
've
come
to
explain
myself
,
I
consider
it
my
*NL*
duty
,
so
to
speak
.
I
want
to
make
clear
to
you
how
the
whole
business
,
*NL*
the
whole
misunderstanding
arose
.
I
've
caused
you
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
suffering
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
I
am
not
a
monster
.
I
understand
what
*NL*
it
must
mean
for
a
man
who
has
been
unfortunate
,
but
who
is
proud
,
*NL*
imperious
and
above
all
,
impatient
,
to
have
to
bear
such
treatment
!
*NL*
I
regard
you
in
any
case
as
a
man
of
noble
character
and
not
without
*NL*
elements
of
magnanimity
,
though
I
do
n't
agree
with
all
your
convictions
.
*NL*
I
wanted
to
tell
you
this
first
,
frankly
and
quite
sincerely
,
for
above
*NL*
all
I
do
n't
want
to
deceive
you
.
When
I
made
your
acquaintance
,
I
felt
*NL*
attracted
by
you
.
Perhaps
you
will
laugh
at
my
saying
so
.
You
have
a
*NL*
right
to
.
I
know
you
disliked
me
from
the
first
and
indeed
you
've
no
*NL*
reason
to
like
me
.
You
may
think
what
you
like
,
but
I
desire
now
to
do
*NL*
all
I
can
to
efface
that
impression
and
to
show
that
I
am
a
man
of
heart
*NL*
and
conscience
.
I
speak
sincerely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
made
a
dignified
pause
.
Raskolnikov
felt
a
rush
of
*NL*
renewed
alarm
.
The
thought
that
Porfiry
believed
him
to
be
innocent
*NL*
began
to
make
him
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
scarcely
necessary
to
go
over
everything
in
detail
,
''
Porfiry
*NL*
Petrovitch
went
on
.
``
Indeed
,
I
could
scarcely
attempt
it
.
To
begin
with
*NL*
there
were
rumours
.
Through
whom
,
how
,
and
when
those
rumours
came
to
*NL*
me
...
and
how
they
affected
you
,
I
need
not
go
into
.
My
suspicions
*NL*
were
aroused
by
a
complete
accident
,
which
might
just
as
easily
not
have
*NL*
happened
.
What
was
it
?
Hm
!
I
believe
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
that
*NL*
either
.
Those
rumours
and
that
accident
led
to
one
idea
in
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
admit
it
openly
--
for
one
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
--
I
was
*NL*
the
first
to
pitch
on
you
.
The
old
woman
's
notes
on
the
pledges
and
*NL*
the
rest
of
it
--
that
all
came
to
nothing
.
Yours
was
one
of
a
hundred
.
*NL*
I
happened
,
too
,
to
hear
of
the
scene
at
the
office
,
from
a
man
who
*NL*
described
it
capitally
,
unconsciously
reproducing
the
scene
with
great
*NL*
vividness
.
It
was
just
one
thing
after
another
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
my
*NL*
dear
fellow
!
How
could
I
avoid
being
brought
to
certain
ideas
?
From
a
*NL*
hundred
rabbits
you
ca
n't
make
a
horse
,
a
hundred
suspicions
do
n't
make
*NL*
a
proof
,
as
the
English
proverb
says
,
but
that
's
only
from
the
rational
*NL*
point
of
view
--
you
ca
n't
help
being
partial
,
for
after
all
a
lawyer
*NL*
is
only
human
.
I
thought
,
too
,
of
your
article
in
that
journal
,
do
you
*NL*
remember
,
on
your
first
visit
we
talked
of
it
?
I
jeered
at
you
at
the
*NL*
time
,
but
that
was
only
to
lead
you
on
.
I
repeat
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
*NL*
you
are
ill
and
impatient
.
That
you
were
bold
,
headstrong
,
in
earnest
*NL*
and
...
had
felt
a
great
deal
I
recognised
long
before
.
I
,
too
,
have
felt
*NL*
the
same
,
so
that
your
article
seemed
familiar
to
me
.
It
was
conceived
*NL*
on
sleepless
nights
,
with
a
throbbing
heart
,
in
ecstasy
and
suppressed
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
And
that
proud
suppressed
enthusiasm
in
young
people
is
*NL*
dangerous
!
I
jeered
at
you
then
,
but
let
me
tell
you
that
,
as
a
literary
*NL*
amateur
,
I
am
awfully
fond
of
such
first
essays
,
full
of
the
heat
of
*NL*
youth
.
There
is
a
mistiness
and
a
chord
vibrating
in
the
mist
.
Your
*NL*
article
is
absurd
and
fantastic
,
but
there
's
a
transparent
sincerity
,
*NL*
a
youthful
incorruptible
pride
and
the
daring
of
despair
in
it
.
It
's
a
*NL*
gloomy
article
,
but
that
's
what
's
fine
in
it
.
I
read
your
article
and
*NL*
put
it
aside
,
thinking
as
I
did
so
`
that
man
wo
n't
go
the
common
way
.
'
*NL*
Well
,
I
ask
you
,
after
that
as
a
preliminary
,
how
could
I
help
being
*NL*
carried
away
by
what
followed
?
Oh
,
dear
,
I
am
not
saying
anything
,
I
*NL*
am
not
making
any
statement
now
.
I
simply
noted
it
at
the
time
.
What
is
*NL*
there
in
it
?
I
reflected
.
There
's
nothing
in
it
,
that
is
really
nothing
*NL*
and
perhaps
absolutely
nothing
.
And
it
's
not
at
all
the
thing
for
*NL*
the
prosecutor
to
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
notions
:
here
I
have
*NL*
Nikolay
on
my
hands
with
actual
evidence
against
him
--
you
may
think
what
*NL*
you
like
of
it
,
but
it
's
evidence
.
He
brings
in
his
psychology
,
too
;
one
*NL*
has
to
consider
him
,
too
,
for
it
's
a
matter
of
life
and
death
.
Why
am
*NL*
I
explaining
this
to
you
?
That
you
may
understand
,
and
not
blame
my
*NL*
malicious
behaviour
on
that
occasion
.
It
was
not
malicious
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
he-he
!
Do
you
suppose
I
did
n't
come
to
search
your
room
at
the
*NL*
time
?
I
did
,
I
did
,
he-he
!
I
was
here
when
you
were
lying
ill
in
bed
,
*NL*
not
officially
,
not
in
my
own
person
,
but
I
was
here
.
Your
room
was
*NL*
searched
to
the
last
thread
at
the
first
suspicion
;
but
_
umsonst
_
!
I
*NL*
thought
to
myself
,
now
that
man
will
come
,
will
come
of
himself
and
*NL*
quickly
,
too
;
if
he
's
guilty
,
he
's
sure
to
come
.
Another
man
would
n't
,
*NL*
but
he
will
.
And
you
remember
how
Mr.
Razumihin
began
discussing
the
*NL*
subject
with
you
?
We
arranged
that
to
excite
you
,
so
we
purposely
spread
*NL*
rumours
,
that
he
might
discuss
the
case
with
you
,
and
Razumihin
is
not
a
*NL*
man
to
restrain
his
indignation
.
Mr.
Zametov
was
tremendously
struck
by
*NL*
your
anger
and
your
open
daring
.
Think
of
blurting
out
in
a
restaurant
*NL*
'
I
killed
her
.
'
It
was
too
daring
,
too
reckless
.
I
thought
so
myself
,
if
*NL*
he
is
guilty
he
will
be
a
formidable
opponent
.
That
was
what
I
thought
*NL*
at
the
time
.
I
was
expecting
you
.
But
you
simply
bowled
Zametov
over
*NL*
and
...
well
,
you
see
,
it
all
lies
in
this
--
that
this
damnable
psychology
*NL*
can
be
taken
two
ways
!
Well
,
I
kept
expecting
you
,
and
so
it
was
,
you
*NL*
came
!
My
heart
was
fairly
throbbing
.
Ach
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
why
need
you
have
come
?
Your
laughter
,
too
,
as
you
came
in
,
do
you
*NL*
remember
?
I
saw
it
all
plain
as
daylight
,
but
if
I
had
n't
expected
you
*NL*
so
specially
,
I
should
not
have
noticed
anything
in
your
laughter
.
You
*NL*
see
what
influence
a
mood
has
!
Mr.
Razumihin
then
--
ah
,
that
stone
,
that
*NL*
stone
under
which
the
things
were
hidden
!
I
seem
to
see
it
somewhere
*NL*
in
a
kitchen
garden
.
It
was
in
a
kitchen
garden
,
you
told
Zametov
and
*NL*
afterwards
you
repeated
that
in
my
office
?
And
when
we
began
picking
*NL*
your
article
to
pieces
,
how
you
explained
it
!
One
could
take
every
word
*NL*
of
yours
in
two
senses
,
as
though
there
were
another
meaning
hidden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
in
this
way
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
I
reached
the
furthest
limit
,
and
*NL*
knocking
my
head
against
a
post
,
I
pulled
myself
up
,
asking
myself
what
*NL*
I
was
about
.
After
all
,
I
said
,
you
can
take
it
all
in
another
sense
if
*NL*
you
like
,
and
it
's
more
natural
so
,
indeed
.
I
could
n't
help
admitting
*NL*
it
was
more
natural
.
I
was
bothered
!
`
No
,
I
'd
better
get
hold
of
some
*NL*
little
fact
'
I
said
.
So
when
I
heard
of
the
bell-ringing
,
I
held
my
*NL*
breath
and
was
all
in
a
tremor
.
`
Here
is
my
little
fact
,
'
thought
I
,
and
*NL*
I
did
n't
think
it
over
,
I
simply
would
n't
.
I
would
have
given
a
thousand
*NL*
roubles
at
that
minute
to
have
seen
you
with
my
own
eyes
,
when
you
*NL*
walked
a
hundred
paces
beside
that
workman
,
after
he
had
called
you
*NL*
murderer
to
your
face
,
and
you
did
not
dare
to
ask
him
a
question
*NL*
all
the
way
.
And
then
what
about
your
trembling
,
what
about
your
*NL*
bell-ringing
in
your
illness
,
in
semi-delirium
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
can
you
wonder
that
I
played
such
pranks
on
*NL*
you
?
And
what
made
you
come
at
that
very
minute
?
Someone
seemed
to
*NL*
have
sent
you
,
by
Jove
!
And
if
Nikolay
had
not
parted
us
...
and
do
you
*NL*
remember
Nikolay
at
the
time
?
Do
you
remember
him
clearly
?
It
was
a
*NL*
thunderbolt
,
a
regular
thunderbolt
!
And
how
I
met
him
!
I
did
n't
believe
*NL*
in
the
thunderbolt
,
not
for
a
minute
.
You
could
see
it
for
yourself
;
*NL*
and
how
could
I
?
Even
afterwards
,
when
you
had
gone
and
he
began
making
*NL*
very
,
very
plausible
answers
on
certain
points
,
so
that
I
was
surprised
*NL*
at
him
myself
,
even
then
I
did
n't
believe
his
story
!
You
see
what
it
is
*NL*
to
be
as
firm
as
a
rock
!
No
,
thought
I
,
_
Morgenfrueh
_
.
What
has
Nikolay
*NL*
got
to
do
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Razumihin
told
me
just
now
that
you
think
Nikolay
guilty
and
had
*NL*
yourself
assured
him
of
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
failed
him
,
and
he
broke
off
.
He
had
been
listening
in
*NL*
indescribable
agitation
,
as
this
man
who
had
seen
through
and
through
*NL*
him
,
went
back
upon
himself
.
He
was
afraid
of
believing
it
and
did
not
*NL*
believe
it
.
In
those
still
ambiguous
words
he
kept
eagerly
looking
for
*NL*
something
more
definite
and
conclusive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Razumihin
!
''
cried
Porfiry
Petrovitch
,
seeming
glad
of
a
question
*NL*
from
Raskolnikov
,
who
had
till
then
been
silent
.
``
He-he-he
!
But
I
had
to
*NL*
put
Mr.
Razumihin
off
;
two
is
company
,
three
is
none
.
Mr.
Razumihin
is
*NL*
not
the
right
man
,
besides
he
is
an
outsider
.
He
came
running
to
me
*NL*
with
a
pale
face
...
But
never
mind
him
,
why
bring
him
in
?
To
return
*NL*
to
Nikolay
,
would
you
like
to
know
what
sort
of
a
type
he
is
,
how
I
*NL*
understand
him
,
that
is
?
To
begin
with
,
he
is
still
a
child
and
not
*NL*
exactly
a
coward
,
but
something
by
way
of
an
artist
.
Really
,
do
n't
laugh
*NL*
at
my
describing
him
so
.
He
is
innocent
and
responsive
to
influence
.
He
*NL*
has
a
heart
,
and
is
a
fantastic
fellow
.
He
sings
and
dances
,
he
tells
*NL*
stories
,
they
say
,
so
that
people
come
from
other
villages
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
He
attends
school
too
,
and
laughs
till
he
cries
if
you
hold
up
a
finger
*NL*
to
him
;
he
will
drink
himself
senseless
--
not
as
a
regular
vice
,
but
at
*NL*
times
,
when
people
treat
him
,
like
a
child
.
And
he
stole
,
too
,
then
,
*NL*
without
knowing
it
himself
,
for
`
How
can
it
be
stealing
,
if
one
picks
it
*NL*
up
?
'
And
do
you
know
he
is
an
Old
Believer
,
or
rather
a
dissenter
?
There
*NL*
have
been
Wanderers

in
his
family
,
and
he
was
for
two
years
in
his
*NL*
village
under
the
spiritual
guidance
of
a
certain
elder
.
I
learnt
all
*NL*
this
from
Nikolay
and
from
his
fellow
villagers
.
And
what
's
more
,
he
*NL*
wanted
to
run
into
the
wilderness
!
He
was
full
of
fervour
,
prayed
at
*NL*
night
,
read
the
old
books
,
`
the
true
'
ones
,
and
read
himself
crazy

TRANSLATOR
'S
NOTE
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Petersburg
had
a
great
effect
upon
him
,
especially
the
women
and
the
*NL*
wine
.
He
responds
to
everything
and
he
forgot
the
elder
and
all
that
.
I
*NL*
learnt
that
an
artist
here
took
a
fancy
to
him
,
and
used
to
go
and
see
*NL*
him
,
and
now
this
business
came
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
was
frightened
,
he
tried
to
hang
himself
!
He
ran
away
!
How
can
*NL*
one
get
over
the
idea
the
people
have
of
Russian
legal
proceedings
?
The
*NL*
very
word
`
trial
'
frightens
some
of
them
.
Whose
fault
is
it
?
We
shall
*NL*
see
what
the
new
juries
will
do
.
God
grant
they
do
good
!
Well
,
in
*NL*
prison
,
it
seems
,
he
remembered
the
venerable
elder
;
the
Bible
,
too
,
*NL*
made
its
appearance
again
.
Do
you
know
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
the
force
of
*NL*
the
word
`
suffering
'
among
some
of
these
people
!
It
's
not
a
question
of
*NL*
suffering
for
someone
's
benefit
,
but
simply
,
`
one
must
suffer
.
'
If
they
*NL*
suffer
at
the
hands
of
the
authorities
,
so
much
the
better
.
In
my
time
*NL*
there
was
a
very
meek
and
mild
prisoner
who
spent
a
whole
year
in
prison
*NL*
always
reading
his
Bible
on
the
stove
at
night
and
he
read
himself
*NL*
crazy
,
and
so
crazy
,
do
you
know
,
that
one
day
,
apropos
of
nothing
,
he
*NL*
seized
a
brick
and
flung
it
at
the
governor
;
though
he
had
done
him
*NL*
no
harm
.
And
the
way
he
threw
it
too
:
aimed
it
a
yard
on
one
side
*NL*
on
purpose
,
for
fear
of
hurting
him
.
Well
,
we
know
what
happens
to
*NL*
a
prisoner
who
assaults
an
officer
with
a
weapon
.
So
`
he
took
his
*NL*
suffering
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
suspect
now
that
Nikolay
wants
to
take
his
suffering
or
something
*NL*
of
the
sort
.
I
know
it
for
certain
from
facts
,
indeed
.
Only
he
does
n't
*NL*
know
that
I
know
.
What
,
you
do
n't
admit
that
there
are
such
fantastic
*NL*
people
among
the
peasants
?
Lots
of
them
.
The
elder
now
has
begun
*NL*
influencing
him
,
especially
since
he
tried
to
hang
himself
.
But
he
'll
*NL*
come
and
tell
me
all
himself
.
You
think
he
'll
hold
out
?
Wait
a
bit
,
*NL*
he
'll
take
his
words
back
.
I
am
waiting
from
hour
to
hour
for
him
to
*NL*
come
and
abjure
his
evidence
.
I
have
come
to
like
that
Nikolay
and
am
*NL*
studying
him
in
detail
.
And
what
do
you
think
?
He-he
!
He
answered
me
*NL*
very
plausibly
on
some
points
,
he
obviously
had
collected
some
evidence
*NL*
and
prepared
himself
cleverly
.
But
on
other
points
he
is
simply
at
sea
,
*NL*
knows
nothing
and
does
n't
even
suspect
that
he
does
n't
know
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
Nikolay
does
n't
come
in
!
This
is
a
fantastic
,
*NL*
gloomy
business
,
a
modern
case
,
an
incident
of
to-day
when
the
heart
*NL*
of
man
is
troubled
,
when
the
phrase
is
quoted
that
blood
`
renews
,
'
when
*NL*
comfort
is
preached
as
the
aim
of
life
.
Here
we
have
bookish
dreams
,
a
*NL*
heart
unhinged
by
theories
.
Here
we
see
resolution
in
the
first
stage
,
*NL*
but
resolution
of
a
special
kind
:
he
resolved
to
do
it
like
jumping
over
*NL*
a
precipice
or
from
a
bell
tower
and
his
legs
shook
as
he
went
to
the
*NL*
crime
.
He
forgot
to
shut
the
door
after
him
,
and
murdered
two
people
for
*NL*
a
theory
.
He
committed
the
murder
and
could
n't
take
the
money
,
and
what
*NL*
he
did
manage
to
snatch
up
he
hid
under
a
stone
.
It
was
n't
enough
for
*NL*
him
to
suffer
agony
behind
the
door
while
they
battered
at
the
door
and
*NL*
rung
the
bell
,
no
,
he
had
to
go
to
the
empty
lodging
,
half
delirious
,
to
*NL*
recall
the
bell-ringing
,
he
wanted
to
feel
the
cold
shiver
over
again
...
*NL*
Well
,
that
we
grant
,
was
through
illness
,
but
consider
this
:
he
is
*NL*
a
murderer
,
but
looks
upon
himself
as
an
honest
man
,
despises
others
,
*NL*
poses
as
injured
innocence
.
No
,
that
's
not
the
work
of
a
Nikolay
,
my
*NL*
dear
Rodion
Romanovitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
had
been
said
before
had
sounded
so
like
a
recantation
that
*NL*
these
words
were
too
great
a
shock
.
Raskolnikov
shuddered
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
stabbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
...
who
then
...
is
the
murderer
?
''
he
asked
in
a
breathless
voice
,
*NL*
unable
to
restrain
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
Petrovitch
sank
back
in
his
chair
,
as
though
he
were
amazed
at
*NL*
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
the
murderer
?
''
he
repeated
,
as
though
unable
to
believe
his
*NL*
ears
.
``
Why
,
_
you
_
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
!
You
are
the
murderer
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
almost
in
a
whisper
,
in
a
voice
of
genuine
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
leapt
from
the
sofa
,
stood
up
for
a
few
seconds
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
without
uttering
a
word
.
His
face
twitched
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
lip
is
twitching
just
as
it
did
before
,
''
Porfiry
Petrovitch
*NL*
observed
almost
sympathetically
.
``
You
've
been
misunderstanding
me
,
I
*NL*
think
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
''
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
,
``
that
's
why
*NL*
you
are
so
surprised
.
I
came
on
purpose
to
tell
you
everything
and
deal
*NL*
openly
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
I
murdered
her
,
''
Raskolnikov
whispered
like
a
frightened
*NL*
child
caught
in
the
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
you
,
you
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
and
no
one
else
,
''
Porfiry
*NL*
whispered
sternly
,
with
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
and
the
silence
lasted
strangely
long
,
about
ten
*NL*
minutes
.
Raskolnikov
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
passed
his
fingers
*NL*
through
his
hair
.
Porfiry
Petrovitch
sat
quietly
waiting
.
Suddenly
*NL*
Raskolnikov
looked
scornfully
at
Porfiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
at
your
old
tricks
again
,
Porfiry
Petrovitch
!
Your
old
method
*NL*
again

I
wonder
you
do
n't
get
sick
of
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

stop
that

what
does
that
matter
now
?
It
would
be
a
different
*NL*
matter
if
there
were
witnesses
present
,
but
we
are
whispering
alone
.
You
*NL*
see
yourself
that
I
have
not
come
to
chase
and
capture
you
like
a
hare
.
*NL*
Whether
you
confess
it
or
not
is
nothing
to
me
now
;
for
myself
,
I
am
*NL*
convinced
without
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
what
did
you
come
for
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
irritably
.
``
I
ask
you
*NL*
the
same
question
again
:
if
you
consider
me
guilty
,
why
do
n't
you
take
*NL*
me
to
prison
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
your
question

I
will
answer
you
,
point
for
point
.
In
the
*NL*
first
place
,
to
arrest
you
so
directly
is
not
to
my
interest

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so

If
you
are
convinced
you
ought

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
what
if
I
am
convinced

That
's
only
my
dream
for
the
time

Why
*NL*
should
I
put
you
in
safety
?
You
know
that
's
it
,
since
you
ask
me
to
do
*NL*
it
.
If
I
confront
you
with
that
workman
for
instance
and
you
say
to
him
*NL*
`
were
you
drunk
or
not
?
Who
saw
me
with
you
?
I
simply
took
you
to
be
*NL*
drunk
,
and
you
were
drunk
,
too
.
'
Well
,
what
could
I
answer
,
especially
*NL*
as
your
story
is
a
more
likely
one
than
his
?
for
there
's
nothing
but
*NL*
psychology
to
support
his
evidence
--
that
's
almost
unseemly
with
his
ugly
*NL*
mug
,
while
you
hit
the
mark
exactly
,
for
the
rascal
is
an
inveterate
*NL*
drunkard
and
notoriously
so
.
And
I
have
myself
admitted
candidly
several
*NL*
times
already
that
that
psychology
can
be
taken
in
two
ways
and
that
the
*NL*
second
way
is
stronger
and
looks
far
more
probable
,
and
that
apart
from
*NL*
that
I
have
as
yet
nothing
against
you
.
And
though
I
shall
put
you
in
*NL*
prison
and
indeed
have
come
--
quite
contrary
to
etiquette
--
to
inform
you
*NL*
of
it
beforehand
,
yet
I
tell
you
frankly
,
also
contrary
to
etiquette
,
*NL*
that
it
wo
n't
be
to
my
advantage
.
Well
,
secondly
,
I
've
come
to
you
*NL*
because
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
secondly
?
''
Raskolnikov
was
listening
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
as
I
told
you
just
now

I
consider
I
owe
you
an
explanation

I
*NL*

want
you
to
look
upon

as
a
monster
,
as
I
have
a
genuine
liking
*NL*
for
you
,
you
may
believe
me
or
not

And
in
the
third
place
I
've
come
to
*NL*
you
with
a
direct
and
open
proposition
--
that
you
should
surrender
*NL*
and
confess
.
It
will
be
infinitely
more
to
your
advantage

to
my
*NL*
advantage

this
open
on

Raskolnikov
thought
a
minute

Raskolnikov
smiled
malignantly

which
I
do

what
reason

``
Ah

That

my

appear

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
maintained
a
mournful
silence
and
let
his
head
sink
*NL*
dejectedly
.
He
pondered
a
long
while

at
last
smiled
again

his

smile
was
sad

gentle

*NL*

abandoning

keep
up

involuntarily

looked
sadly

at

``

Porfiry
went
on

contempt

though
he
did
not
want
to
speak
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
again
as
though
he
meant
to
go
away

but
sat
down
again
in
*NL*
evident
despair

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
it

but
how
long
has
your
life
been
?
How
much
do
*NL*
you
understand
?
You
made
up
a
theory
and
then
were
ashamed
that
it
broke
*NL*
down
and
turned
out
to
be
not
at
all
original

It
turned
out
something
*NL*
base

that
's
true
,
but
you
are
not
hopelessly
base

By
no
means
so
base
!
*NL*
At
least
you
did
n't
deceive
yourself
for
long
,
you
went
straight
to
the
*NL*
furthest
point
at
one
bound
.
How
do
I
regard
you
?
I
regard
you
as
one
*NL*
of
those
men

would
stand
and
smile
at
their
torturer
while
he
cuts
*NL*
their
entrails
out

if
only
they
have
found
faith

God

Find
it

*NL*
you
will
live

You
have
long
needed
a
change
of
air

Suffering
,
too
,
*NL*
is
a
good
thing

Suffer
!
Maybe
Nikolay
is
right
in
wanting
to
suffer
.
*NL*
I
know
you
do
n't
believe
in
it
--
but
do
n't
be
over-wise
;
fling
yourself
*NL*
straight
into
life
,
without
deliberation
;
do
n't
be
afraid
--
the
flood
*NL*
will
bear
you
to
the
bank
and
set
you
safe
on
your
feet
again
.
What
*NL*
bank
?
How
can
I
tell
?
I
only
believe
that
you
have
long
life
before
*NL*
you
.
I
know
that
you
take
all
my
words
now
for
a
set
speech
prepared
*NL*
beforehand
,
but
maybe
you
will
remember
them
after
.
They
may
be
of
use
*NL*
some
time
.
That
's
why
I
speak
.
It
's
as
well
that
you
only
killed
the
*NL*
old
woman
.
If
you
'd
invented
another
theory
you
might
perhaps
have
*NL*
done
something
a
thousand
times
more
hideous

You
ought
to
thank
God
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
How
do
you
know
?
Perhaps
God
is
saving
you
for
something
.
*NL*
But
keep
a
good
heart
and
have
less
fear
!
Are
you
afraid
of
the
great
*NL*
expiation
before
you

No
,
it
would
be
shameful
to
be
afraid
of
it
.
Since
*NL*
you
have
taken
such
a
step
,
you
must
harden
your
heart
.
There
is
justice
*NL*
in
it
.
You
must
fulfil
the
demands
of
justice
.
I
know
that
you
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it

but
indeed
,
life
will
bring
you
through
.
You
will
live
it

down
in

fresh

with
sullen
insistence

*NL*
``
You
're
a
strange
man

I
have
listened

you
from
simple
curiosity

But

that

*NL*

Oh

it
your

he
added
,
dropping
his
voice
.
``
It
's
an
awkward

''
*NL*
*NL*
Porfiry
went
out
,
stooping
and
avoiding
looking
at
Raskolnikov
.
The
*NL*
latter
went
to
the
window
and
waited
with
irritable
impatience
till
he
*NL*
calculated
that
Porfiry
had
reached
the
street
and
moved
away
.
Then
he
*NL*
too
went
hurriedly
out
of
the
room
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
to
Svidrigailov
's
.
What
he
had
to
hope
from
that
man
he
*NL*
did
not
know
.
But
that
man
had
some
hidden
power
over
him
.
Having
once
*NL*
recognised
this
,
he
could
not
rest
,
and
now
the
time
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
,
one
question
particularly
worried
him
:
had
Svidrigailov
been
*NL*
to
Porfiry
's
?
*NL*
*NL*
As
far
as
he
could
judge
,
he
would
swear
to
it
,
that
he
had
not
.
He
*NL*
pondered
again
and
again
,
went
over
Porfiry
's
visit
;
no
,
he
had
n't
been
,
*NL*
of
course
he
had
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
he
had
not
been
yet
,
would
he
go
?
Meanwhile
,
for
the
present
he
*NL*
fancied
he
could
n't
.
Why
?
He
could
not
have
explained
,
but
if
he
could
,
*NL*
he
would
not
have
wasted
much
thought
over
it
at
the
moment
.
It
all
*NL*
worried
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
attend
to
it
.
Strange
to
*NL*
say
,
none
would
have
believed
it
perhaps
,
but
he
only
felt
a
faint
vague
*NL*
anxiety
about
his
immediate
future
.
Another
,
much
more
important
anxiety
*NL*
tormented
him
--
it
concerned
himself
,
but
in
a
different
,
more
vital
way
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
was
conscious
of
immense
moral
fatigue
,
though
his
mind
was
*NL*
working
better
that
morning
than
it
had
done
of
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
was
it
worth
while
,
after
all
that
had
happened
,
to
contend
with
*NL*
these
new
trivial
difficulties
?
Was
it
worth
while
,
for
instance
,
to
*NL*
manoeuvre
that
Svidrigailov
should
not
go
to
Porfiry
's
?
Was
it
worth
*NL*
while
to
investigate
,
to
ascertain
the
facts
,
to
waste
time
over
anyone
*NL*
like
Svidrigailov
?
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
sick
he
was
of
it
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
was
hastening
to
Svidrigailov
;
could
he
be
expecting
*NL*
something
_
new
_
from
him
,
information
,
or
means
of
escape
?
Men
will
*NL*
catch
at
straws
!
Was
it
destiny
or
some
instinct
bringing
them
together
?
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
only
fatigue
,
despair
;
perhaps
it
was
not
Svidrigailov
*NL*
but
some
other
whom
he
needed
,
and
Svidrigailov
had
simply
presented
*NL*
himself
by
chance
.
Sonia
?
But
what
should
he
go
to
Sonia
for
now
?
To
beg
*NL*
her
tears
again
?
He
was
afraid
of
Sonia
,
too
.
Sonia
stood
before
him
as
*NL*
an
irrevocable
sentence
.
He
must
go
his
own
way
or
hers
.
At
that
moment
*NL*
especially
he
did
not
feel
equal
to
seeing
her
.
No
,
would
it
not
be
*NL*
better
to
try
Svidrigailov
?
And
he
could
not
help
inwardly
owning
that
*NL*
he
had
long
felt
that
he
must
see
him
for
some
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
could
they
have
in
common
?
Their
very
evil-doing
could
not
*NL*
be
of
the
same
kind
.
The
man
,
moreover
,
was
very
unpleasant
,
evidently
*NL*
depraved
,
undoubtedly
cunning
and
deceitful
,
possibly
malignant
.
Such
*NL*
stories
were
told
about
him
.
It
is
true
he
was
befriending
Katerina
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
children
,
but
who
could
tell
with
what
motive
and
what
it
*NL*
meant
?
The
man
always
had
some
design
,
some
project
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
thought
which
had
been
continually
hovering
of
late
*NL*
about
Raskolnikov
's
mind
,
and
causing
him
great
uneasiness
.
It
was
so
*NL*
painful
that
he
made
distinct
efforts
to
get
rid
of
it
.
He
sometimes
*NL*
thought
that
Svidrigailov
was
dogging
his
footsteps
.
Svidrigailov
had
*NL*
found
out
his
secret
and
had
had
designs
on
Dounia
.
What
if
he
had
them
*NL*
still
?
Was
n't
it
practically
certain
that
he
had
?
And
what
if
,
having
*NL*
learnt
his
secret
and
so
having
gained
power
over
him
,
he
were
to
use
it
*NL*
as
a
weapon
against
Dounia
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
sometimes
even
tormented
his
dreams
,
but
it
had
never
*NL*
presented
itself
so
vividly
to
him
as
on
his
way
to
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
The
very
thought
moved
him
to
gloomy
rage
.
To
begin
with
,
this
would
*NL*
transform
everything
,
even
his
own
position
;
he
would
have
at
once
to
*NL*
confess
his
secret
to
Dounia
.
Would
he
have
to
give
himself
up
perhaps
*NL*
to
prevent
Dounia
from
taking
some
rash
step
?
The
letter
?
This
morning
*NL*
Dounia
had
received
a
letter
.
From
whom
could
she
get
letters
in
*NL*
Petersburg
?
Luzhin
,
perhaps
?
It
's
true
Razumihin
was
there
to
protect
*NL*
her
,
but
Razumihin
knew
nothing
of
the
position
.
Perhaps
it
was
his
duty
*NL*
to
tell
Razumihin
?
He
thought
of
it
with
repugnance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
case
he
must
see
Svidrigailov
as
soon
as
possible
,
he
decided
*NL*
finally
.
Thank
God
,
the
details
of
the
interview
were
of
little
*NL*
consequence
,
if
only
he
could
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
;
but
*NL*
if
Svidrigailov
were
capable
...
if
he
were
intriguing
against
*NL*
Dounia
--
then
...
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
so
exhausted
by
what
he
had
passed
through
that
month
*NL*
that
he
could
only
decide
such
questions
in
one
way
;
``
then
I
shall
kill
*NL*
him
,
''
he
thought
in
cold
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
anguish
oppressed
his
heart
,
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
street
and
began
looking
about
to
see
where
he
was
and
which
way
he
*NL*
was
going
.
He
found
himself
in
X.
Prospect
,
thirty
or
forty
paces
from
*NL*
the
Hay
Market
,
through
which
he
had
come
.
The
whole
second
storey
of
*NL*
the
house
on
the
left
was
used
as
a
tavern
.
All
the
windows
were
wide
*NL*
open
;
judging
from
the
figures
moving
at
the
windows
,
the
rooms
were
*NL*
full
to
overflowing
.
There
were
sounds
of
singing
,
of
clarionet
and
*NL*
violin
,
and
the
boom
of
a
Turkish
drum
.
He
could
hear
women
shrieking
.
*NL*
He
was
about
to
turn
back
wondering
why
he
had
come
to
the
X.
Prospect
,
*NL*
when
suddenly
at
one
of
the
end
windows
he
saw
Svidrigailov
,
sitting
*NL*
at
a
tea-table
right
in
the
open
window
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
dreadfully
taken
aback
,
almost
terrified
.
Svidrigailov
*NL*
was
silently
watching
and
scrutinising
him
and
,
what
struck
Raskolnikov
*NL*
at
once
,
seemed
to
be
meaning
to
get
up
and
slip
away
unobserved
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
at
once
pretended
not
to
have
seen
him
,
but
to
be
looking
*NL*
absent-mindedly
away
,
while
he
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
.
*NL*
His
heart
was
beating
violently
.
Yet
,
it
was
evident
that
Svidrigailov
*NL*
did
not
want
to
be
seen
.
He
took
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
concealing
himself
,
but
as
he
got
up
and
moved
back
his
*NL*
chair
,
he
seemed
to
have
become
suddenly
aware
that
Raskolnikov
had
seen
*NL*
him
,
and
was
watching
him
.
What
had
passed
between
them
was
much
the
*NL*
same
as
what
happened
at
their
first
meeting
in
Raskolnikov
's
room
.
A
*NL*
sly
smile
came
into
Svidrigailov
's
face
and
grew
broader
and
*NL*
broader
.
Each
knew
that
he
was
seen
and
watched
by
the
other
.
At
last
*NL*
Svidrigailov
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
come
in
if
you
want
me
;
I
am
here
!
''
he
shouted
from
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
up
into
the
tavern
.
He
found
Svidrigailov
in
a
tiny
*NL*
back
room
,
adjoining
the
saloon
in
which
merchants
,
clerks
and
numbers
*NL*
of
people
of
all
sorts
were
drinking
tea
at
twenty
little
tables
to
the
*NL*
desperate
bawling
of
a
chorus
of
singers
.
The
click
of
billiard
balls
*NL*
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
.
On
the
table
before
Svidrigailov
stood
*NL*
an
open
bottle
and
a
glass
half
full
of
champagne
.
In
the
room
he
found
*NL*
also
a
boy
with
a
little
hand
organ
,
a
healthy-looking
red-cheeked
girl
*NL*
of
eighteen
,
wearing
a
tucked-up
striped
skirt
,
and
a
Tyrolese
hat
with
*NL*
ribbons
.
In
spite
of
the
chorus
in
the
other
room
,
she
was
singing
some
*NL*
servants
'
hall
song
in
a
rather
husky
contralto
,
to
the
accompaniment
of
*NL*
the
organ
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
's
enough
,
''
Svidrigailov
stopped
her
at
Raskolnikov
's
*NL*
entrance
.
The
girl
at
once
broke
off
and
stood
waiting
respectfully
.
*NL*
She
had
sung
her
guttural
rhymes
,
too
,
with
a
serious
and
respectful
*NL*
expression
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
Philip
,
a
glass
!
''
shouted
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
drink
anything
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
I
did
n't
mean
it
for
you
.
Drink
,
Katia
!
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
anything
more
to-day
,
you
can
go
.
''
He
poured
her
out
a
full
glass
,
and
*NL*
laid
down
a
yellow
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katia
drank
off
her
glass
of
wine
,
as
women
do
,
without
putting
it
down
,
*NL*
in
twenty
gulps
,
took
the
note
and
kissed
Svidrigailov
's
hand
,
which
he
*NL*
allowed
quite
seriously
.
She
went
out
of
the
room
and
the
boy
trailed
*NL*
after
her
with
the
organ
.
Both
had
been
brought
in
from
the
street
.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
had
not
been
a
week
in
Petersburg
,
but
everything
about
him
*NL*
was
already
,
so
to
speak
,
on
a
patriarchal
footing
;
the
waiter
,
Philip
,
*NL*
was
by
now
an
old
friend
and
very
obsequious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
leading
to
the
saloon
had
a
lock
on
it
.
Svidrigailov
was
at
*NL*
home
in
this
room
and
perhaps
spent
whole
days
in
it
.
The
tavern
was
*NL*
dirty
and
wretched
,
not
even
second-rate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
see
you
and
looking
for
you
,
''
Raskolnikov
began
,
``
but
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
made
me
turn
from
the
Hay
Market
into
the
X.
Prospect
*NL*
just
now
.
I
never
take
this
turning
.
I
turn
to
the
right
from
the
Hay
*NL*
Market
.
And
this
is
n't
the
way
to
you
.
I
simply
turned
and
here
you
are
.
*NL*
It
is
strange
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
say
at
once
`
it
's
a
miracle
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
may
be
only
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
the
way
with
all
you
folk
,
''
laughed
Svidrigailov
.
``
You
wo
n't
*NL*
admit
it
,
even
if
you
do
inwardly
believe
it
a
miracle
!
Here
you
say
*NL*
that
it
may
be
only
chance

And
what
cowards
they
all
are
here
,
about
*NL*
having
an
opinion
of
their
own
,
you
ca
n't
fancy
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
you
,
you
have
an
opinion
of
your
own
and
are
not
afraid
to
*NL*
have
it
.
That
's
how
it
was
you
attracted
my
curiosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
enough
,
you
know
,
''
Svidrigailov
was
obviously
exhilarated
,
*NL*
but
only
slightly
so
,
he
had
not
had
more
than
half
a
glass
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
you
came
to
see
me
before
you
knew
that
I
was
capable
of
having
*NL*
what
you
call
an
opinion
of
my
own
,
''
observed
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
it
was
a
different
matter
.
Everyone
has
his
own
plans

And
*NL*
apropos
of
the
miracle
let
me
tell
you
that
I
think
you
have
been
asleep
*NL*
for
the
last
two
or
three
days

I
told
you
of
this
tavern
myself

there
*NL*
is
no
miracle
in
your
coming
straight
here

I
explained
the
way
myself

*NL*
told

where
it
was

and
the
hours
you

find
me
here

Do
you
*NL*
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember

''
answered
Raskolnikov
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you

I
told
you
twice

The
address
has
been
stamped

mechanically
on
your
memory
.
You
turned
this
way
mechanically
and
yet
*NL*
precisely
according
to
the
direction
,
though
you
are
not
aware
of
*NL*
it
.
When
I
told
you
then
,
I
hardly
hoped
you
understood
me
.
You
give
*NL*
yourself
away
too
much
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
And
another
thing
,
I
'm
*NL*
convinced
there
are
lots
of
people
in
Petersburg
who
talk
to
themselves
*NL*
as
they
walk
.
This
is
a
town
of
crazy
people
.
If
only
we
had
scientific
*NL*
men
,
doctors
,
lawyers
and
philosophers
might
make
most
valuable
*NL*
investigations
in
Petersburg
each
in
his
own
line
.
There
are
few
places
*NL*
where
there
are
so
many
gloomy
,
strong
and
queer
influences
on
the
soul
*NL*
of
man
as
in
Petersburg
.
The
mere
influences
of
climate
mean
so
much
.
*NL*
And
it
's
the
administrative
centre
of
all
Russia
and
its
character
must
*NL*
be
reflected
on
the
whole
country
.
But
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
*NL*
now
.
The
point
is
that
I
have
several
times
watched
you
.
You
walk
out
*NL*
of
your
house
--
holding
your
head
high
--
twenty
paces
from
home
you
let
it
*NL*
sink
,
and
fold
your
hands
behind
your
back
.
You
look
and
evidently
see
*NL*
nothing
before
nor
beside
you
.
At
last
you
begin
moving
your
lips
and
*NL*
talking
to
yourself
,
and
sometimes
you
wave
one
hand
and
declaim
,
and
at
*NL*
last
stand
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
That
's
not
at
all
the
thing
.
*NL*
Someone
may
be
watching
you
besides
me
,
and
it
wo
n't
do
you
any
good
.
*NL*
It
's
nothing
really
to
do
with
me
and
I
ca
n't
cure
you
,
but
,
of
course
,
*NL*
you
understand
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
I
am
being
followed
?
''
asked
Raskolnikov
,
looking
*NL*
inquisitively
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
''
said
Svidrigailov
,
seeming
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
us
leave
me
alone
,
''
Raskolnikov
muttered
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
let
us
leave
you
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
tell
me
,
if
you
come
here
to
drink
,
and
directed
me
*NL*
twice
to
come
here
to
you
,
why
did
you
hide
,
and
try
to
get
away
just
*NL*
now
when
I
looked
at
the
window
from
the
street
?
I
saw
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He-he
!
And
why
was
it
you
lay
on
your
sofa
with
closed
eyes
and
*NL*
pretended
to
be
asleep
,
though
you
were
wide
awake
while
I
stood
in
your
*NL*
doorway
?
I
saw
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
had
...
reasons
.
You
know
that
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
may
have
had
my
reasons
,
though
you
do
n't
know
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
dropped
his
right
elbow
on
the
table
,
leaned
his
chin
in
the
*NL*
fingers
of
his
right
hand
,
and
stared
intently
at
Svidrigailov
.
For
a
*NL*
full
minute
he
scrutinised
his
face
,
which
had
impressed
him
before
.
It
*NL*
was
a
strange
face
,
like
a
mask
;
white
and
red
,
with
bright
red
lips
,
*NL*
with
a
flaxen
beard
,
and
still
thick
flaxen
hair
.
His
eyes
were
somehow
*NL*
too
blue
and
their
expression
somehow
too
heavy
and
fixed
.
There
was
*NL*
something
awfully
unpleasant
in
that
handsome
face
,
which
looked
so
*NL*
wonderfully
young
for
his
age
.
Svidrigailov
was
smartly
dressed
in
light
*NL*
summer
clothes
and
was
particularly
dainty
in
his
linen
.
He
wore
a
huge
*NL*
ring
with
a
precious
stone
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
got
to
bother
myself
about
you
,
too
,
now
?
''
said
Raskolnikov
*NL*
suddenly
,
coming
with
nervous
impatience
straight
to
the
point
.
``
Even
*NL*
though
perhaps
you
are
the
most
dangerous
man
if
you
care
to
injure
me
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
put
myself
out
any
more
.
I
will
show
you
at
once
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
prize
myself
as
you
probably
think
I
do
.
I
've
come
to
tell
you
at
*NL*
once
that
if
you
keep
to
your
former
intentions
with
regard
to
my
sister
*NL*
and
if
you
think
to
derive
any
benefit
in
that
direction
from
what
has
*NL*
been
discovered
of
late
,
I
will
kill
you
before
you
get
me
locked
up
.
*NL*
You
can
reckon
on
my
word
.
You
know
that
I
can
keep
it
.
And
in
the
*NL*
second
place
if
you
want
to
tell
me
anything
--
for
I
keep
fancying
all
*NL*
this
time
that
you
have
something
to
tell
me
--
make
haste
and
tell
it
,
*NL*
for
time
is
precious
and
very
likely
it
will
soon
be
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
in
such
haste
?
''
asked
Svidrigailov
,
looking
at
him
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everyone
has
his
plans
,
''
Raskolnikov
answered
gloomily
and
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
urged
me
yourself
to
frankness
just
now
,
and
at
the
first
question
*NL*
you
refuse
to
answer
,
''
Svidrigailov
observed
with
a
smile
.
``
You
*NL*
keep
fancying
that
I
have
aims
of
my
own
and
so
you
look
at
me
with
*NL*
suspicion
.
Of
course
it
's
perfectly
natural
in
your
position
.
But
*NL*
though
I
should
like
to
be
friends
with
you
,
I
sha
n't
trouble
myself
*NL*
to
convince
you
of
the
contrary
.
The
game
is
n't
worth
the
candle
and
I
*NL*
was
n't
intending
to
talk
to
you
about
anything
special
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
want
me
,
for
,
then
?
It
was
you
who
came
hanging
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
simply
as
an
interesting
subject
for
observation
.
I
liked
the
*NL*
fantastic
nature
of
your
position
--
that
's
what
it
was
!
Besides
you
are
*NL*
the
brother
of
a
person
who
greatly
interested
me
,
and
from
that
person
*NL*
I
had
in
the
past
heard
a
very
great
deal
about
you
,
from
which
I
*NL*
gathered
that
you
had
a
great
influence
over
her
;
is
n't
that
enough
?
*NL*
Ha-ha-ha
!
Still
I
must
admit
that
your
question
is
rather
complex
,
and
*NL*
is
difficult
for
me
to
answer
.
Here
,
you
,
for
instance
,
have
come
to
me
*NL*
not
only
for
a
definite
object
,
but
for
the
sake
of
hearing
something
*NL*
new
.
Is
n't
that
so
?
Is
n't
that
so
?
''
persisted
Svidrigailov
with
a
sly
*NL*
smile
.
``
Well
,
ca
n't
you
fancy
then
that
I
,
too
,
on
my
way
here
in
the
*NL*
train
was
reckoning
on
you
,
on
your
telling
me
something
new
,
and
on
my
*NL*
making
some
profit
out
of
you
!
You
see
what
rich
men
we
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
profit
could
you
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
tell
you
?
How
do
I
know

You
see
in
what
a
tavern
I
spend
all
*NL*
my
time
and
it
's
my
enjoyment
,
that
's
to
say
it
's
no
great
enjoyment
,
*NL*
but
one
must
sit
somewhere
;
that
poor
Katia
now
--
you
saw
her
?
...
If
only
*NL*
I
had
been
a
glutton
now
,
a
club
gourmand
,
but
you
see
I
can
eat
this

*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
to
a
little
table
in
the
corner
where
the
remnants
of
a
*NL*
terrible-looking
beef-steak
and
potatoes
lay
on
a
tin
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
dined

I

Except
for

I
never
touch

anything

not
more
than
a
glass
of
that
all
the
evening

even

that
is
enough
to
make
my
head
ache

I
ordered

just
now

up

I
am
just
going
off
somewhere

you
see
me
in

peculiar
state

That
was
why
I
hid
myself
just
now

was
afraid

hinder

I

he

pulled
out
his

like
a
direct
question

In

there
is
something

permanent

founded
indeed
upon
nature

not
dependent
on
fantasy

something
present
in

setting
one
on

,
maybe
,
not
to
be
quickly
extinguished

even

with

an
occupation

a
sort

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

``
Oh

everything

in

exceed
moderation

another

added
hurriedly

with
none

His

quite
changed

with

disgust

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my

I

answered
Svidrigailov
laughing
.
``
However

I

it

me
be
a
braggart

why
not

if
it
hurts
no

I
spent
seven
years
in
the
country
with
Marfa
Petrovna
,
so
now
when
*NL*
I
come
across
an
intelligent
person
like

intelligent
and
highly
*NL*
interesting
--
I
am
simply
glad
to

I

it

gone
to

And

there
's
a
certain
fact
that
has
wound
me
up
tremendously

about
that

will
keep
quiet

Where
are
you
off
to
?
''
he
asked
in
alarm

*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
begun
getting
up
.
He
felt
oppressed
and
stifled
and
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
ill
at
ease
at
having
come
here
.
He
felt
convinced
that
*NL*
Svidrigailov
was
the
most
worthless
scoundrel
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ach

Sit
down

Svidrigailov
begged

``

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
perhaps
--
yes
,
I
told
you
myself
,
''
began
Svidrigailov
,
``
that
*NL*
I
was
in
the
debtors
'
prison
here
,
for
an
immense
sum
,
and
had
not
*NL*
any
expectation
of
being
able
to
pay
it
.
There
's
no
need
to
go
into
*NL*
particulars
how
Marfa
Petrovna
bought
me
out
;
do
you
know
to
what
a
*NL*
point
of
insanity
a
woman
can
sometimes
love
?
She
was
an
honest
woman
,
*NL*
and
very
sensible
,
although
completely
uneducated
.
Would
you
believe
*NL*
that
this
honest
and
jealous
woman
,
after
many
scenes
of
hysterics
and
*NL*
reproaches
,
condescended
to
enter
into
a
kind
of
contract
with
me
which
*NL*
she
kept
throughout
our
married
life
?
She
was
considerably
older
than
*NL*
I
,
and
besides
,
she
always
kept
a
clove
or
something
in
her
mouth
.
There
*NL*
was
so
much
swinishness
in
my
soul
and
honesty
too
,
of
a
sort
,
as
to
*NL*
tell
her
straight
out
that
I
could
n't
be
absolutely
faithful
to
her
.
*NL*
This
confession
drove
her
to
frenzy
,
but
yet
she
seems
in
a
way
to
have
*NL*
liked
my
brutal
frankness
.
She
thought
it
showed
I
was
unwilling
to
*NL*
deceive
her
if
I
warned
her
like
this
beforehand
and
for
a
jealous
*NL*
woman
,
you
know
,
that
's
the
first
consideration
.
After
many
tears
an
*NL*
unwritten
contract
was
drawn
up
between
us
:
first
,
that
I
would
never
*NL*
leave
Marfa
Petrovna
and
would
always
be
her
husband
;
secondly
,
that
I
*NL*
would
never
absent
myself
without
her
permission
;
thirdly
,
that
I
would
*NL*
never
set
up
a
permanent
mistress
;
fourthly
,
in
return
for
this
,
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
gave
me
a
free
hand
with
the
maidservants
,
but
only
with
her
*NL*
secret
knowledge
;
fifthly
,
God
forbid
my
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
of
*NL*
our
class
;
sixthly
,
in
case
I
--
which
God
forbid
--
should
be
visited
by
*NL*
a
great
serious
passion
I
was
bound
to
reveal
it
to
Marfa
Petrovna
.
On
*NL*
this
last
score
,
however
,
Marfa
Petrovna
was
fairly
at
ease
.
She
was
a
*NL*
sensible
woman
and
so
she
could
not
help
looking
upon
me
as
a
dissolute
*NL*
profligate
incapable
of
real
love
.
But
a
sensible
woman
and
a
jealous
*NL*
woman
are
two
very
different
things
,
and
that
's
where
the
trouble
*NL*
came
in
.
But
to
judge
some
people
impartially
we
must
renounce
certain
*NL*
preconceived
opinions
and
our
habitual
attitude
to
the
ordinary
people
*NL*
about
us
.
I
have
reason
to
have
faith
in
your
judgment
rather
than
*NL*
in
anyone
's
.
Perhaps
you
have
already
heard
a
great
deal
that
was
*NL*
ridiculous
and
absurd
about
Marfa
Petrovna
.
She
certainly
had
some
very
*NL*
ridiculous
ways
,
but
I
tell
you
frankly
that
I
feel
really
sorry
for
the
*NL*
innumerable
woes
of
which
I
was
the
cause
.
Well
,
and
that
's
enough
,
I
*NL*
think
,
by
way
of
a
decorous
_
oraison
funebre
_
for
the
most
tender
wife
*NL*
of
a
most
tender
husband
.
When
we
quarrelled
,
I
usually
held
my
tongue
*NL*
and
did
not
irritate
her
and
that
gentlemanly
conduct
rarely
failed
to
*NL*
attain
its
object
,
it
influenced
her
,
it
pleased
her
,
indeed
.
These
were
*NL*
times
when
she
was
positively
proud
of
me
.
But
your
sister
she
could
n't
*NL*
put
up
with
,
anyway
.
And
however
she
came
to
risk
taking
such
a
*NL*
beautiful
creature
into
her
house
as
a
governess
.
My
explanation
is
that
*NL*
Marfa
Petrovna
was
an
ardent
and
impressionable
woman
and
simply
fell
*NL*
in
love
herself
--
literally
fell
in
love
--
with
your
sister
.
Well
,
little
*NL*
wonder
--
look
at
Avdotya
Romanovna
!
I
saw
the
danger
at
the
first
glance
*NL*
and
what
do
you
think
,
I
resolved
not
to
look
at
her
even
.
But
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
herself
made
the
first
step
,
would
you
believe
it
?
Would
you
*NL*
believe
it
too
that
Marfa
Petrovna
was
positively
angry
with
me
at
first
*NL*
for
my
persistent
silence
about
your
sister
,
for
my
careless
reception
*NL*
of
her
continual
adoring
praises
of
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
it
was
she
wanted
!
Well
,
of
course
,
Marfa
Petrovna
told
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
every
detail
about
me
.
She
had
the
unfortunate
habit
of
*NL*
telling
literally
everyone
all
our
family
secrets
and
continually
*NL*
complaining
of
me
;
how
could
she
fail
to
confide
in
such
a
delightful
*NL*
new
friend
?
I
expect
they
talked
of
nothing
else
but
me
and
no
doubt
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
heard
all
those
dark
mysterious
rumours
that
were
*NL*
current
about
me
...
I
do
n't
mind
betting
that
you
too
have
heard
*NL*
something
of
the
sort
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
.
Luzhin
charged
you
with
having
caused
the
death
of
a
child
.
Is
*NL*
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
refer
to
those
vulgar
tales
,
I
beg
,
''
said
Svidrigailov
with
*NL*
disgust
and
annoyance
.
``
If
you
insist
on
wanting
to
know
about
all
that
*NL*
idiocy
,
I
will
tell
you
one
day
,
but
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
told
too
about
some
footman
of
yours
in
the
country
whom
you
*NL*
treated
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
drop
the
subject
,
''
Svidrigailov
interrupted
again
with
*NL*
obvious
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
the
footman
who
came
to
you
after
death
to
fill
your
pipe
?
...
*NL*
you
told
me
about
it
yourself
.
''
Raskolnikov
felt
more
and
more
*NL*
irritated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
looked
at
him
attentively
and
Raskolnikov
fancied
he
caught
*NL*
a
flash
of
spiteful
mockery
in
that
look
.
But
Svidrigailov
restrained
*NL*
himself
and
answered
very
civilly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
.
I
see
that
you
,
too
,
are
extremely
interested
and
shall
*NL*
feel
it
my
duty
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
at
the
first
opportunity
.
Upon
*NL*
my
soul
!
I
see
that
I
really
might
pass
for
a
romantic
figure
with
*NL*
some
people
.
Judge
how
grateful
I
must
be
to
Marfa
Petrovna
for
having
*NL*
repeated
to
Avdotya
Romanovna
such
mysterious
and
interesting
gossip
*NL*
about
me
.
I
dare
not
guess
what
impression
it
made
on
her
,
but
in
any
*NL*
case
it
worked
in
my
interests
.
With
all
Avdotya
Romanovna
's
natural
*NL*
aversion
and
in
spite
of
my
invariably
gloomy
and
repellent
aspect
--
she
*NL*
did
at
least
feel
pity
for
me
,
pity
for
a
lost
soul
.
And
if
once
a
*NL*
girl
's
heart
is
moved
to
_
pity
_
,
it
's
more
dangerous
than
anything
.
She
*NL*
is
bound
to
want
to
`
save
him
,
'
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
,
and
lift
*NL*
him
up
and
draw
him
to
nobler
aims
,
and
restore
him
to
new
life
and
*NL*
usefulness
--
well
,
we
all
know
how
far
such
dreams
can
go
.
I
saw
at
once
*NL*
that
the
bird
was
flying
into
the
cage
of
herself
.
And
I
too
made
ready
.
*NL*
I
think
you
are
frowning
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
?
There
's
no
need
.
As
you
*NL*
know
,
it
all
ended
in
smoke
.
-LRB-
Hang
it
all
,
what
a
lot
I
am
drinking
!
-RRB-
*NL*
Do
you
know
,
I
always
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
regretted
that
it
was
n't
*NL*
your
sister
's
fate
to
be
born
in
the
second
or
third
century
A.D.
,
as
*NL*
the
daughter
of
a
reigning
prince
or
some
governor
or
pro-consul
in
Asia
*NL*
Minor
.
She
would
undoubtedly
have
been
one
of
those
who
would
endure
*NL*
martyrdom
and
would
have
smiled
when
they
branded
her
bosom
with
hot
*NL*
pincers
.
And
she
would
have
gone
to
it
of
herself
.
And
in
the
fourth
or
*NL*
fifth
century
she
would
have
walked
away
into
the
Egyptian
desert
and
*NL*
would
have
stayed
there
thirty
years
living
on
roots
and
ecstasies
and
*NL*
visions
.
She
is
simply
thirsting
to
face
some
torture
for
someone
,
and
*NL*
if
she
ca
n't
get
her
torture
,
she
'll
throw
herself
out
of
a
window
.
I
've
*NL*
heard
something
of
a
Mr.
Razumihin
--
he
's
said
to
be
a
sensible
fellow
;
*NL*
his
surname
suggests
it
,
indeed
.
He
's
probably
a
divinity
student
.
Well
,
*NL*
he
'd
better
look
after
your
sister
!
I
believe
I
understand
her
,
and
I
am
*NL*
proud
of
it
.
But
at
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
,
as
you
know
,
one
*NL*
is
apt
to
be
more
heedless
and
stupid
.
One
does
n't
see
clearly
.
Hang
it
*NL*
all
,
why
is
she
so
handsome
?
It
's
not
my
fault
.
In
fact
,
it
began
on
*NL*
my
side
with
a
most
irresistible
physical
desire
.
Avdotya
Romanovna
is
*NL*
awfully
chaste
,
incredibly
and
phenomenally
so
.
Take
note
,
I
tell
you
*NL*
this
about
your
sister
as
a
fact
.
She
is
almost
morbidly
chaste
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
broad
intelligence
,
and
it
will
stand
in
her
way
.
There
*NL*
happened
to
be
a
girl
in
the
house
then
,
Parasha
,
a
black-eyed
*NL*
wench
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
--
she
had
just
come
from
another
*NL*
village
--
very
pretty
,
but
incredibly
stupid
:
she
burst
into
tears
,
*NL*
wailed
so
that
she
could
be
heard
all
over
the
place
and
caused
scandal
.
*NL*
One
day
after
dinner
Avdotya
Romanovna
followed
me
into
an
avenue
in
*NL*
the
garden
and
with
flashing
eyes
_
insisted
_
on
my
leaving
poor
Parasha
*NL*
alone
.
It
was
almost
our
first
conversation
by
ourselves
.
I
,
of
course
,
*NL*
was
only
too
pleased
to
obey
her
wishes
,
tried
to
appear
disconcerted
,
*NL*
embarrassed
,
in
fact
played
my
part
not
badly
.
Then
came
interviews
,
*NL*
mysterious
conversations
,
exhortations
,
entreaties
,
supplications
,
even
*NL*
tears
--
would
you
believe
it
,
even
tears
?
Think
what
the
passion
for
*NL*
propaganda
will
bring
some
girls
to
!
I
,
of
course
,
threw
it
all
on
*NL*
my
destiny
,
posed
as
hungering
and
thirsting
for
light
,
and
finally
*NL*
resorted
to
the
most
powerful
weapon
in
the
subjection
of
the
*NL*
female
heart
,
a
weapon
which
never
fails
one
.
It
's
the
well-known
*NL*
resource
--
flattery
.
Nothing
in
the
world
is
harder
than
speaking
the
*NL*
truth
and
nothing
easier
than
flattery
.
If
there
's
the
hundredth
part
*NL*
of
a
false
note
in
speaking
the
truth
,
it
leads
to
a
discord
,
and
that
*NL*
leads
to
trouble
.
But
if
all
,
to
the
last
note
,
is
false
in
flattery
,
it
*NL*
is
just
as
agreeable
,
and
is
heard
not
without
satisfaction
.
It
may
be
*NL*
a
coarse
satisfaction
,
but
still
a
satisfaction
.
And
however
coarse
the
*NL*
flattery
,
at
least
half
will
be
sure
to
seem
true
.
That
's
so
for
all
*NL*
stages
of
development
and
classes
of
society
.
A
vestal
virgin
might
be
*NL*
seduced
by
flattery
.
I
can
never
remember
without
laughter
how
I
once
*NL*
seduced
a
lady
who
was
devoted
to
her
husband
,
her
children
,
and
her
*NL*
principles
.
What
fun
it
was
and
how
little
trouble
!
And
the
lady
really
*NL*
had
principles
--
of
her
own
,
anyway
.
All
my
tactics
lay
in
simply
being
*NL*
utterly
annihilated
and
prostrate
before
her
purity
.
I
flattered
her
*NL*
shamelessly
,
and
as
soon
as
I
succeeded
in
getting
a
pressure
of
*NL*
the
hand
,
even
a
glance
from
her
,
I
would
reproach
myself
for
having
*NL*
snatched
it
by
force
,
and
would
declare
that
she
had
resisted
,
so
that
*NL*
I
could
never
have
gained
anything
but
for
my
being
so
unprincipled
.
*NL*
I
maintained
that
she
was
so
innocent
that
she
could
not
foresee
my
*NL*
treachery
,
and
yielded
to
me
unconsciously
,
unawares
,
and
so
on
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
I
triumphed
,
while
my
lady
remained
firmly
convinced
that
she
was
*NL*
innocent
,
chaste
,
and
faithful
to
all
her
duties
and
obligations
and
*NL*
had
succumbed
quite
by
accident
.
And
how
angry
she
was
with
me
when
I
*NL*
explained
to
her
at
last
that
it
was
my
sincere
conviction
that
she
was
*NL*
just
as
eager
as
I.
Poor
Marfa
Petrovna
was
awfully
weak
on
the
side
of
*NL*
flattery
,
and
if
I
had
only
cared
to
,
I
might
have
had
all
her
property
*NL*
settled
on
me
during
her
lifetime
.
-LRB-
I
am
drinking
an
awful
lot
of
wine
*NL*
now
and
talking
too
much
.
-RRB-
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
angry
if
I
mention
now
*NL*
that
I
was
beginning
to
produce
the
same
effect
on
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
*NL*
But
I
was
stupid
and
impatient
and
spoiled
it
all
.
Avdotya
Romanovna
had
*NL*
several
times
--
and
one
time
in
particular
--
been
greatly
displeased
by
*NL*
the
expression
of
my
eyes
,
would
you
believe
it
?
There
was
sometimes
a
*NL*
light
in
them
which
frightened
her
and
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
*NL*
more
unguarded
till
it
was
hateful
to
her
.
No
need
to
go
into
detail
,
*NL*
but
we
parted
.
There
I
acted
stupidly
again
.
I
fell
to
jeering
in
the
*NL*
coarsest
way
at
all
such
propaganda
and
efforts
to
convert
me
;
Parasha
*NL*
came
on
to
the
scene
again
,
and
not
she
alone
;
in
fact
there
was
a
*NL*
tremendous
to-do
.
Ah
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
,
if
you
could
only
see
how
your
*NL*
sister
's
eyes
can
flash
sometimes
!
Never
mind
my
being
drunk
at
this
*NL*
moment
and
having
had
a
whole
glass
of
wine
.
I
am
speaking
the
truth
.
*NL*
I
assure
you
that
this
glance
has
haunted
my
dreams
;
the
very
rustle
of
*NL*
her
dress
was
more
than
I
could
stand
at
last
.
I
really
began
to
think
*NL*
that
I
might
become
epileptic
.
I
could
never
have
believed
that
I
could
*NL*
be
moved
to
such
a
frenzy
.
It
was
essential
,
indeed
,
to
be
reconciled
,
*NL*
but
by
then
it
was
impossible
.
And
imagine
what
I
did
then
!
To
what
*NL*
a
pitch
of
stupidity
a
man
can
be
brought
by
frenzy
!
Never
undertake
*NL*
anything
in
a
frenzy
,
Rodion
Romanovitch
.
I
reflected
that
Avdotya
*NL*
Romanovna
was
after
all
a
beggar
-LRB-
ach
,
excuse
me
,
that
's
not
the
word
...
*NL*
but
does
it
matter
if
it
expresses
the
meaning
?
-RRB-
,
that
she
lived
by
*NL*
her
work
,
that
she
had
her
mother
and
you
to
keep
-LRB-
ach
,
hang
it
,
you
*NL*
are
frowning
again
-RRB-
,
and
I
resolved
to
offer
her
all
my
money
--
thirty
*NL*
thousand
roubles
I
could
have
realised
then
--
if
she
would
run
away
with
*NL*
me
here
,
to
Petersburg
.
Of
course
I
should
have
vowed
eternal
love
,
*NL*
rapture
,
and
so
on
.
Do
you
know
,
I
was
so
wild
about
her
at
that
time
*NL*
that
if
she
had
told
me
to
poison
Marfa
Petrovna
or
to
cut
her
throat
*NL*
and
to
marry
herself
,
it
would
have
been
done
at
once
!
But
it
ended
in
*NL*
the
catastrophe
of
which
you
know
already
.
You
can
fancy
how
frantic
I
*NL*
was
when
I
heard
that
Marfa
Petrovna
had
got
hold
of
that
scoundrelly
*NL*
attorney
,
Luzhin
,
and
had
almost
made
a
match
between
them
--
which
would
*NL*
really
have
been
just
the
same
thing
as
I
was
proposing
.
Would
n't
it
?
*NL*
Would
n't
it
?
I
notice
that
you
've
begun
to
be
very
attentive
...
you
*NL*
interesting
young
man
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
impatiently
.
He
was
flushed
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
saw
clearly
that
the
glass
or
glass
and
a
half
of
champagne
*NL*
that
he
had
sipped
almost
unconsciously
was
affecting
him
--
and
he
*NL*
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
.
He
felt
very
suspicious
*NL*
of
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
after
what
you
have
said
,
I
am
fully
convinced
that
you
have
*NL*
come
to
Petersburg
with
designs
on
my
sister
,
''
he
said
directly
to
*NL*
Svidrigailov
,
in
order
to
irritate
him
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nonsense
,
''
said
Svidrigailov
,
seeming
to
rouse
himself
.
``
Why
,
I
*NL*
told
you
...
besides
your
sister
ca
n't
endure
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
certain
that
she
ca
n't
,
but
that
's
not
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
so
sure
that
she
ca
n't
?
''
Svidrigailov
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
*NL*
smiled
mockingly
.
``
You
are
right
,
she
does
n't
love
me
,
but
you
can
*NL*
never
be
sure
of
what
has
passed
between
husband
and
wife
or
lover
and
*NL*
mistress
.
There
's
always
a
little
corner
which
remains
a
secret
to
*NL*
the
world
and
is
only
known
to
those
two
.
Will
you
answer
for
it
that
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
regarded
me
with
aversion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
some
words
you
've
dropped
,
I
notice
that
you
still
have
*NL*
designs
--
and
of
course
evil
ones
--
on
Dounia
and
mean
to
carry
them
out
*NL*
promptly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
have
I
dropped
words
like
that
?
''
Svidrigailov
asked
in
naive
*NL*
dismay
,
taking
not
the
slightest
notice
of
the
epithet
bestowed
on
his
*NL*
designs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
are
dropping
them
even
now

Why
are
you
so
frightened

are
you
so
afraid

now

*NL*
*NL*
``

have
rather
to
be
afraid

But
what
nonsense
...
I
've
drunk
too
much
though
,
I
see
that
.
I
*NL*
was
almost
saying
too
much
again
.
Damn
the
wine
!
Hi

there

water

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
snatched
up
the
champagne
bottle
and
flung
it
without
ceremony
out
of
*NL*
the
window
.
Philip
brought
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
nonsense
!
''
said
Svidrigailov
,
wetting
a
towel
and
putting
it
*NL*
to
his
head
.
``
But
I
can
answer
you
in
one
word
and
annihilate
all
your
*NL*
suspicions
.
Do
you
know
that
I
am
going
to
get
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
so
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?
I
've
forgotten
.
But
I
could
n't
have
told
you
so
for
certain
for
*NL*
I
had
not
even
seen
my
betrothed
;
I
only
meant
to
.
But
now
I
really
*NL*
have
a
betrothed
and
it
's
a
settled
thing
,
and
if
it
were
n't
that
I
have

ca

I
would
have
taken
you

to
ask

only
ten
*NL*
minutes
left

See
,
look
at
the
watch
.
But
I
must
tell
you
,
for
it
's
an
*NL*
interesting
story
,
my
marriage
,
in
its
own
way
.
Where
are
you
off
to
?
*NL*
Going
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
going
away
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
?
We
shall
see
.
I
'll
take
you
there
,
I
'll
show
you
my
*NL*
betrothed
,
only
not
now
.
For
you
'll
soon
have
to
be
off
.
You
have
to
go
*NL*
to
the
right
and
I
to
the
left
.
Do
you
know
that
Madame
Resslich
,
the
*NL*
woman
I
am
lodging
with
now
,
eh
?
I
know
what
you
're
thinking
,
that
she
's
*NL*
the
woman
whose
girl
they
say
drowned
herself
in
the
winter
.
Come
,
are
*NL*
you
listening
?
She
arranged
it
all
for
me
.
You
're
bored
,
she
said
,
*NL*
you
want
something
to
fill
up
your
time
.
For
,
you
know
,
I
am
a
gloomy
,
*NL*
depressed
person
.
Do
you
think
I
'm
light-hearted
?
No
,
I
'm
gloomy
.
I
do
*NL*
no
harm
,
but
sit
in
a
corner
without
speaking
a
word
for
three
days
at
a
*NL*
time
.
And
that
Resslich
is
a
sly
hussy
,
I
tell
you
.
I
know
what
she
has
*NL*
got
in
her
mind
;
she
thinks
I
shall
get
sick
of
it
,
abandon
my
wife
and
*NL*
depart
,
and
she
'll
get
hold
of
her
and
make
a
profit
out
of
her
--
in
our
*NL*
class
,
of
course
,
or
higher
.
She
told
me
the
father
was
a
broken-down
*NL*
retired
official
,
who
has
been
sitting
in
a
chair
for
the
last
three
*NL*
years
with
his
legs
paralysed
.
The
mamma
,
she
said
,
was
a
sensible
*NL*
woman
.
There
is
a
son
serving
in
the
provinces
,
but
he
does
n't
help
;
*NL*
there
is
a
daughter
,
who
is
married
,
but
she
does
n't
visit
them
.
And
*NL*
they
've
two
little
nephews
on
their
hands
,
as
though
their
own
children
*NL*
were
not
enough
,
and
they
've
taken
from
school
their
youngest
daughter
,
*NL*
a
girl
who
'll
be
sixteen
in
another
month
,
so
that
then
she
can
be
*NL*
married
.
She
was
for
me
.
We
went
there
.
How
funny
it
was
!
I
present
*NL*
myself
--
a
landowner
,
a
widower
,
of
a
well-known
name
,
with
connections
,
*NL*
with
a
fortune
.
What
if
I
am
fifty
and
she
is
not
sixteen
?
Who
thinks
*NL*
of
that
?
But
it
's
fascinating
,
is
n't
it
?
It
is
fascinating
,
ha-ha
!
You
*NL*
should
have
seen
how
I
talked
to
the
papa
and
mamma
.
It
was
worth
paying
*NL*
to
have
seen
me
at
that
moment
.
She
comes
in
,
curtseys
,
you
can
fancy
,
*NL*
still
in
a
short
frock
--
an
unopened
bud
!
Flushing
like
a
sunset
--
she
had
*NL*
been
told
,
no
doubt
.
I
do
n't
know
how
you
feel
about
female
faces
,
but
*NL*
to
my
mind
these
sixteen
years
,
these
childish
eyes
,
shyness
and
tears
*NL*
of
bashfulness
are
better
than
beauty
;
and
she
is
a
perfect
little
*NL*
picture
,
too
.
Fair
hair
in
little
curls
,
like
a
lamb
's
,
full
little
rosy
*NL*
lips
,
tiny
feet
,
a
charmer
!
...
Well
,
we
made
friends
.
I
told
them
I
was
*NL*
in
a
hurry
owing
to
domestic
circumstances
,
and
the
next
day
,
that
is
*NL*
the
day
before
yesterday
,
we
were
betrothed
.
When
I
go
now
I
take
her
on
*NL*
my
knee
at
once
and
keep
her
there
...
Well
,
she
flushes
like
a
sunset
*NL*
and
I
kiss
her
every
minute
.
Her
mamma
of
course
impresses
on
her
that
*NL*
this
is
her
husband
and
that
this
must
be
so
.
It
's
simply
delicious
!
The
*NL*
present
betrothed
condition
is
perhaps
better
than
marriage
.
Here
you
*NL*
have
what
is
called
_
la
nature
et
la
verite
_
,
ha-ha
!
I
've
talked
to
her
*NL*
twice
,
she
is
far
from
a
fool
.
Sometimes
she
steals
a
look
at
me
that
*NL*
positively
scorches
me
.
Her
face
is
like
Raphael
's
Madonna
.
You
know
,
*NL*
the
Sistine
Madonna
's
face
has
something
fantastic
in
it
,
the
face
*NL*
of
mournful
religious
ecstasy
.
Have
n't
you
noticed
it
?
Well
,
she
's
*NL*
something
in
that
line
.
The
day
after
we
'd
been
betrothed
,
I
bought
her
*NL*
presents
to
the
value
of
fifteen
hundred
roubles
--
a
set
of
diamonds
and
*NL*
another
of
pearls
and
a
silver
dressing-case
as
large
as
this
,
with
all
*NL*
sorts
of
things
in
it
,
so
that
even
my
Madonna
's
face
glowed
.
I
sat
her
*NL*
on
my
knee
,
yesterday
,
and
I
suppose
rather
too
unceremoniously
--
she
*NL*
flushed
crimson
and
the
tears
started
,
but
she
did
n't
want
to
show
it
.
*NL*
We
were
left
alone
,
she
suddenly
flung
herself
on
my
neck
-LRB-
for
the
first
*NL*
time
of
her
own
accord
-RRB-
,
put
her
little
arms
round
me
,
kissed
me
,
and
*NL*
vowed
that
she
would
be
an
obedient
,
faithful
,
and
good
wife
,
would
make
*NL*
me
happy
,
would
devote
all
her
life
,
every
minute
of
her
life
,
would
*NL*
sacrifice
everything
,
everything
,
and
that
all
she
asks
in
return
is
*NL*
my
_
respect
_
,
and
that
she
wants
`
nothing
,
nothing
more
from
me
,
no
*NL*
presents
.
'
You
'll
admit
that
to
hear
such
a
confession
,
alone
,
from
an
*NL*
angel
of
sixteen
in
a
muslin
frock
,
with
little
curls
,
with
a
flush
*NL*
of
maiden
shyness
in
her
cheeks
and
tears
of
enthusiasm
in
her
eyes
is
*NL*
rather
fascinating
!
Is
n't
it
fascinating
?
It
's
worth
paying
for
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
Well
...
listen
,
we
'll
go
to
see
my
betrothed
,
only
not
just
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
this
monstrous
difference
in
age
and
development
excites
*NL*
your
sensuality

Will
you
really
make
such
a
marriage
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

course

Everyone
thinks
of
himself

lives

gaily

best

deceive
himself

Ha-ha
!
But
why
are
you
so
keen
about
*NL*
virtue
?
Have
mercy
on
me
,
my
good
friend

I
am

sinful
man

``
But

fond

laughed
Svidrigailov

*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
one
curious
instance
of
it

The
first
day
I
came
here
I
*NL*
visited
various
haunts
,
after
seven
years
I
simply
rushed
at
them
.
You
*NL*
probably
notice
that
I
am
not
in
a
hurry
to
renew
acquaintance
with
my
*NL*
old
friends

I
shall
do
without

as
long
as
I
can
.
Do
you
know
,
when
*NL*
I
was
with
Marfa
Petrovna
in
the
country
,
I
was
haunted
by
the
thought
*NL*
of
these
places
where
anyone
who
knows
his
way
about
can
find
a
great
*NL*
deal
.
Yes
,
upon
my
soul
!
The
peasants
have
vodka
,
the
educated
young
*NL*
people
,
shut
out
from
activity
,
waste
themselves
in
impossible
dreams
*NL*
and
visions
and
are
crippled
by
theories
;
Jews
have
sprung
up
and
are
*NL*
amassing
money
,
and
all
the
rest
give
themselves
up
to
debauchery
.
From
*NL*
the
first
hour
the
town
reeked
of
its
familiar
odours
.
I
chanced
to
be
*NL*
in
a
frightful
den
--
I
like
my
dens
dirty
--
it
was
a
dance
,
so
called
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
_
cancan
_
such
as
I
never
saw
in
my
day
.
Yes
,
there
you
*NL*
have
progress
.
All
of
a
sudden
I
saw
a
little
girl
of
thirteen
,
nicely
*NL*
dressed
,
dancing
with
a
specialist
in
that
line
,
with
another
one
*NL*
_
vis-a-vis
_
.
Her
mother
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
wall
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
fancy
what
a
_
cancan
_
that
was
!
The
girl
was
ashamed
,
blushed
,
at
*NL*
last
felt
insulted
,
and
began
to
cry
.
Her
partner
seized
her
and
began
*NL*
whirling
her
round
and
performing
before
her
;
everyone
laughed
and
--
I
*NL*
like
your
public
,
even
the
_
cancan
_
public
--
they
laughed
and
shouted
,
*NL*
`
Serves
her
right
--
serves
her
right
!
Should
n't
bring
children
!
'
Well
,
*NL*
it
's
not
my
business
whether
that
consoling
reflection
was
logical
or
*NL*
not
.
I
at
once
fixed
on
my
plan
,
sat
down
by
the
mother
,
and
began
by
*NL*
saying
that
I
too
was
a
stranger
and
that
people
here
were
ill-bred
and
*NL*
that
they
could
n't
distinguish
decent
folks
and
treat
them
with
respect
,
*NL*
gave
her
to
understand
that
I
had
plenty
of
money
,
offered
to
take
them
*NL*
home
in
my
carriage
.
I
took
them
home
and
got
to
know
them
.
They
were
*NL*
lodging
in
a
miserable
little
hole
and
had
only
just
arrived
from
the
*NL*
country
.
She
told
me
that
she
and
her
daughter
could
only
regard
my
*NL*
acquaintance
as
an
honour
.
I
found
out
that
they
had
nothing
of
their
*NL*
own
and
had
come
to
town
upon
some
legal
business
.
I
proffered
my
*NL*
services
and
money
.
I
learnt
that
they
had
gone
to
the
dancing
saloon
*NL*
by
mistake
,
believing
that
it
was
a
genuine
dancing
class
.
I
offered
to
*NL*
assist
in
the
young
girl
's
education
in
French
and
dancing
.
My
offer
was
*NL*
accepted
with
enthusiasm
as
an
honour
--
and
we
are
still
friendly
...
If
*NL*
you
like
,
we
'll
go
and
see
them
,
only
not
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
Enough
of
your
vile
,
nasty
anecdotes

depraved
vile

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare

I
can
see

am

muttered
Raskolnikov
*NL*
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
laughed
heartily
;
finally
he
called
Philip
,
paid
his
bill
,
*NL*
and
began
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
but
I

said

*NL*
``

should
rather

cried
Raskolnikov
,
*NL*
getting
up
.
``
No
doubt
it
is
a
pleasure
for
a
worn-out
profligate
to
*NL*
describe
such

with

of
the
same
sort
in
*NL*
his
mind

especially
under
such
circumstances
and
to
such
a

as

It
's
stimulating
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
come
to
that

Svidrigailov
answered
,
scrutinising
*NL*
Raskolnikov
with
some
surprise
,
``

you
come
to
that

you
are

can
do

But
enough

I
sincerely
*NL*
regret
not
having
had
more
talk
with
you

I
sha
n't
lose

Only

''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
walked
out
of
the
restaurant
.
Raskolnikov
walked
out
after
*NL*
him
.
Svidrigailov
was
not
however
very
drunk
,
the
wine
had
affected
him
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
but
it
was
passing
off
every
minute
.
He
was
preoccupied
*NL*
with
something
of
importance
and
was
frowning
.
He
was
apparently
excited
*NL*
and
uneasy
in
anticipation
of
something
.
His
manner
to
Raskolnikov
had
*NL*
changed
during
the
last
few
minutes
,
and
he
was
ruder
and
more
sneering
*NL*
every
moment
.
Raskolnikov
noticed
all
this
,
and
he
too
was
uneasy
.
He
*NL*
became
very
suspicious
of
Svidrigailov
and
resolved
to
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
out
on
to
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
to
the
right

I
to

*NL*
Only

he
walked
to

Hay

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
cried
Svidrigailov
turning
round
,
``
I
thought
I
said
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
that
I
am
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
stood
still
and
gazed
at
one
another
,
as
though
measuring
their
*NL*
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
all
your
half
tipsy
stories
,
''
Raskolnikov
observed
harshly
,
``
I
am
*NL*
_
positive
_
that
you
have
not
given
up
your
designs
on
my
sister
,
but
*NL*
are
pursuing
them
more
actively
than
ever
.
I
have
learnt
that
my
sister
*NL*
received
a
letter
this
morning
.
You
have
hardly
been
able
to
sit
still
*NL*
all
this
time
...
You
may
have
unearthed
a
wife
on
the
way
,
but
that
*NL*
means
nothing

I
should
like
to
make
certain
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
could
hardly
have
said
himself
what
he
wanted
and
of
what
he
*NL*
wished
to
make
certain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
I
'll
call
the
police
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
away

*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
stood
for
a
minute
facing
each
other
.
At
last
Svidrigailov
's
*NL*
face
changed
.
Having
satisfied
himself
that
Raskolnikov
was
not
*NL*
frightened
at
his
threat
,
he
assumed
a
mirthful
and
friendly
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fellow
!
I
purposely
refrained
from
referring
to
your
affair

*NL*
though
I
am
devoured
by
curiosity

It
's
a
fantastic
affair

I
've
put
it

off
till
another
time

you
're
enough
to
rouse
the
dead

Well

us
go

only
I
warn
you
beforehand

am
only
going
home
for
a
moment

get
some
money

then
I
shall
lock
up
the
flat

take
a
cab

go
to

spend
the
evening
at

Islands

you
going

*NL*
``
I

coming

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
you
like

Sofya
Semyonovna
is
not
at

She
has
taken
*NL*
the
three
children
to
an
old
lady
of
high
rank
,
the
patroness
of
some
*NL*
orphan
asylums
,
whom
I
used
to
know
years
ago

I
charmed
the
old
lady
by
*NL*
depositing
a
sum
of
money
with
her
to
provide
for
the
three
children
of
*NL*
Katerina
Ivanovna
and
subscribing
to
the
institution
as
well

I
told
her
*NL*
too
the
story
of
Sofya
Semyonovna
in
full
detail
,
suppressing
nothing
.
*NL*
It
produced
an
indescribable
effect
on
her
.
That
's
why
Sofya
Semyonovna
*NL*
has
been
invited
to
call
to-day
at
the
X.
Hotel

the

is

staying

nothing

at

By
the
way

I
am
convinced
that
you
regard

with
suspicion

just
because
I
have
shown
such
delicacy

have
not
so
far
troubled
*NL*
you
with
questions

understand

It
struck
you
as
extraordinary

I

Svidrigailov

quite
behind

Svidrigailov
was
already
in
the
carriage

Raskolnikov
decided
that
his
*NL*
suspicions
were
at
least
for
that
moment
unjust
.
Without
answering
a
*NL*
word
he
turned
and
walked
back
towards
the
Hay
Market

If
he
had
only
*NL*
turned
round
on
his
way
he
might
have
seen
Svidrigailov
get
out
not
a

hundred
paces
off
,
dismiss
the
cab
and
walk
along
the
pavement
.
But
he
*NL*
had
turned
the
corner
and
could
see
nothing
.
Intense
disgust
drew
him
*NL*
away
from
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
that
I
could
for
one
instant
have
looked

coarse
brute

that
depraved
sensualist
and
blackguard

he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
judgment
was
uttered
too
lightly
and
hastily
:
there
was
*NL*
something
about
Svidrigailov
which
gave
him
a
certain
original
,
even
a
*NL*
mysterious
character
.
As
concerned
his
sister
,
Raskolnikov
was
convinced
*NL*
that
Svidrigailov
would
not
leave
her
in
peace
.
But
it
was
too
tiresome
*NL*
and
unbearable
to
go
on
thinking
and
thinking
about
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
alone
,
he
had
not
gone
twenty
paces
before
he
sank
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
into
deep
thought
.
On
the
bridge
he
stood
by
the
railing
and
*NL*
began
gazing
at
the
water
.
And
his
sister
was
standing
close
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
her
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
,
but
passed
by
without
seeing
*NL*
her
.
Dounia
had
never
met
him
like
this
in
the
street
before
and
was
*NL*
struck
with
dismay
.
She
stood
still
and
did
not
know
whether
to
call
*NL*
to
him
or
not
.
Suddenly
she
saw
Svidrigailov
coming
quickly
from
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
Hay
Market
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
approaching
cautiously
.
He
did
not
go
on
to
the
*NL*
bridge
,
but
stood
aside
on
the
pavement
,
doing
all
he
could
to
avoid
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
seeing
him
.
He
had
observed
Dounia
for
some
time
and
had
*NL*
been
making
signs
to
her
.
She
fancied
he
was
signalling
to
beg
her
not
*NL*
to
speak
to
her
brother
,
but
to
come
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
Dounia
did
.
She
stole
by
her
brother
and
went
up
to
*NL*
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
make
haste
away
,
''
Svidrigailov
whispered
to
her
,
``
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
Rodion
Romanovitch
to
know
of
our
meeting
.
I
must
tell
you
I
've
been
*NL*
sitting
with
him
in
the
restaurant
close
by
,
where
he
looked
me
up
and
*NL*
I
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
him
.
He
has
somehow
heard
of
*NL*
my
letter
to
you
and
suspects
something
.
It
was
n't
you
who
told
him
,
of
*NL*
course
,
but
if
not
you
,
who
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
've
turned
the
corner
now
,
''
Dounia
interrupted
,
``
and
my
brother
*NL*
wo
n't
see
us
.
I
have
to
tell
you
that
I
am
going
no
further
with
you
.
*NL*
Speak
to
me
here
.
You
can
tell
it
all
in
the
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
ca
n't
say
it
in
the
street
;
secondly
,
you
must
*NL*
hear
Sofya
Semyonovna
too
;
and
,
thirdly
,
I
will
show
you
some
papers
...
*NL*
Oh
well
,
if
you
wo
n't
agree
to
come
with
me
,
I
shall
refuse
to
give
*NL*
any
explanation
and
go
away
at
once
.
But
I
beg
you
not
to
forget
that
*NL*
a
very
curious
secret
of
your
beloved
brother
's
is
entirely
in
my
*NL*
keeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
stood
still
,
hesitating
,
and
looked
at
Svidrigailov
with
*NL*
searching
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
afraid
of
?
''
he
observed
quietly
.
``
The
town
is
not
the
*NL*
country
.
And
even
in
the
country
you
did
me
more
harm
than
I
did
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
prepared
Sofya
Semyonovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
not
said
a
word
to
her
and
am
not
quite
certain
whether
she
*NL*
is
at
home
now
.
But
most
likely
she
is
.
She
has
buried
her
stepmother
*NL*
to-day
:
she
is
not
likely
to
go
visiting
on
such
a
day
.
For
the
time
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
speak
to
anyone
about
it
and
I
half
regret
having
spoken
*NL*
to
you
.
The
slightest
indiscretion
is
as
bad
as
betrayal
in
a
thing
like
*NL*
this
.
I
live
there
in
that
house
,
we
are
coming
to
it
.
That
's
the
porter
*NL*
of
our
house
--
he
knows
me
very
well
;
you
see
,
he
's
bowing
;
he
sees
I
'm
*NL*
coming
with
a
lady
and
no
doubt
he
has
noticed
your
face
already
and
you
*NL*
will
be
glad
of
that
if
you
are
afraid
of
me
and
suspicious
.
Excuse
*NL*
my
putting
things
so
coarsely
.
I
have
n't
a
flat
to
myself
;
Sofya
*NL*
Semyonovna
's
room
is
next
to
mine
--
she
lodges
in
the
next
flat
.
The
*NL*
whole
floor
is
let
out
in
lodgings
.
Why
are
you
frightened
like
a
child
?
*NL*
Am
I
really
so
terrible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
's
lips
were
twisted
in
a
condescending
smile
;
but
he
was
in
*NL*
no
smiling
mood
.
His
heart
was
throbbing
and
he
could
scarcely
breathe
.
*NL*
He
spoke
rather
loud
to
cover
his
growing
excitement
.
But
Dounia
did
not
*NL*
notice
this
peculiar
excitement
,
she
was
so
irritated
by
his
remark
that
*NL*
she
was
frightened
of
him
like
a
child
and
that
he
was
so
terrible
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
I
know
that
you
are
not
a
man
...
of
honour
,
I
am
not
in
the
*NL*
least
afraid
of
you
.
Lead
the
way
,
''
she
said
with
apparent
composure
,
*NL*
but
her
face
was
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
stopped
at
Sonia
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
inquire
whether
she
is
at
home
...
She
is
not
.
How
*NL*
unfortunate
!
But
I
know
she
may
come
quite
soon
.
If
she
's
gone
out
,
it
*NL*
can
only
be
to
see
a
lady
about
the
orphans
.
Their
mother
is
dead
...
*NL*
I
've
been
meddling
and
making
arrangements
for
them
.
If
Sofya
Semyonovna
*NL*
does
not
come
back
in
ten
minutes
,
I
will
send
her
to
you
,
to-day
if
*NL*
you
like
.
This
is
my
flat
.
These
are
my
two
rooms
.
Madame
Resslich
,
*NL*
my
landlady
,
has
the
next
room
.
Now
,
look
this
way
.
I
will
show
you
*NL*
my
chief
piece
of
evidence
:
this
door
from
my
bedroom
leads
into
two
*NL*
perfectly
empty
rooms
,
which
are
to
let
.
Here
they
are
...
You
must
look
*NL*
into
them
with
some
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
occupied
two
fairly
large
furnished
rooms
.
Dounia
was
*NL*
looking
about
her
mistrustfully
,
but
saw
nothing
special
in
the
*NL*
furniture
or
position
of
the
rooms
.
Yet
there
was
something
to
observe
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
that
Svidrigailov
's
flat
was
exactly
between
two
sets
of
*NL*
almost
uninhabited
apartments
.
His
rooms
were
not
entered
directly
*NL*
from
the
passage
,
but
through
the
landlady
's
two
almost
empty
rooms
.
*NL*
Unlocking
a
door
leading
out
of
his
bedroom
,
Svidrigailov
showed
Dounia
*NL*
the
two
empty
rooms
that
were
to
let
.
Dounia
stopped
in
the
doorway
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
she
was
called
to
look
upon
,
but
Svidrigailov
hastened
to
*NL*
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
at
this
second
large
room
.
Notice
that
door
,
it
's
locked
.
*NL*
By
the
door
stands
a
chair
,
the
only
one
in
the
two
rooms
.
I
brought
it
*NL*
from
my
rooms
so
as
to
listen
more
conveniently
.
Just
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
door
is
Sofya
Semyonovna
's
table
;
she
sat
there
talking
to
Rodion
*NL*
Romanovitch
.
And
I
sat
here
listening
on
two
successive
evenings
,
for
*NL*
two
hours
each
time
--
and
of
course
I
was
able
to
learn
something
,
what
*NL*
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
listened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
.
Now
come
back
to
my
room
;
we
ca
n't
sit
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
Avdotya
Romanovna
back
into
his
sitting-room
and
offered
her
*NL*
a
chair
.
He
sat
down
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
at
least
seven
*NL*
feet
from
her
,
but
probably
there
was
the
same
glow
in
his
eyes
which
*NL*
had
once
frightened
Dounia
so
much
.
She
shuddered
and
once
more
looked
*NL*
about
her
distrustfully
.
It
was
an
involuntary
gesture
;
she
evidently
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
betray
her
uneasiness
.
But
the
secluded
position
of
*NL*
Svidrigailov
's
lodging
had
suddenly
struck
her
.
She
wanted
to
ask
*NL*
whether
his
landlady
at
least
were
at
home
,
but
pride
kept
her
from
*NL*
asking
.
Moreover
,
she
had
another
trouble
in
her
heart
incomparably
*NL*
greater
than
fear
for
herself
.
She
was
in
great
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
your
letter
,
''
she
said
,
laying
it
on
the
table
.
``
Can
it
be
true
*NL*
what
you
write
?
You
hint
at
a
crime
committed
,
you
say
,
by
my
brother
.
*NL*
You
hint
at
it
too
clearly
;
you
dare
n't
deny
it
now
.
I
must
tell
you
*NL*
that
I
'd
heard
of
this
stupid
story
before
you
wrote
and
do
n't
believe
a
*NL*
word
of
it
.
It
's
a
disgusting
and
ridiculous
suspicion
.
I
know
the
story
*NL*
and
why
and
how
it
was
invented
.
You
can
have
no
proofs
.
You
promised
to
*NL*
prove
it
.
Speak
!
But
let
me
warn
you
that
I
do
n't
believe
you
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
said
this
,
speaking
hurriedly
,
and
for
an
instant
the
colour
*NL*
rushed
to
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
did
n't
believe
it
,
how
could
you
risk
coming
alone
to
my
rooms
?

Why
have
you
come
?
Simply
from
curiosity
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
torment
me
.
Speak
,
speak
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
denying
that
you
are
a
brave
girl

Upon
my
word

I
thought
*NL*
you
would
have
asked
Mr.
Razumihin
to
escort
you
here
.
But
he
was
not
*NL*
with
you
nor
anywhere
near

I
was
on
the
look-out
.
It
's
spirited
of
*NL*
you

it
proves
you
wanted
to
spare
Rodion
Romanovitch

But
everything
*NL*
is
divine
in
you

About
your
brother
,
what
am
I
to
say
to
you

You

seen
him
yourself

you
think
of
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
that
's
not
the
only
thing
you
are
building
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
on
that
,
but
on
his
own
words
.
He
came
here
on
two
successive
*NL*
evenings
to
see
Sofya
Semyonovna
.
I
've
shown
you
where
they
sat
.
He
made
*NL*
a
full
confession
to
her
.
He
is
a
murderer
.
He
killed
an
old
woman
,
a
*NL*
pawnbroker
,
with
whom
he
had
pawned
things
himself
.
He
killed
her
sister
*NL*
too
,
a
pedlar
woman
called
Lizaveta
,
who
happened
to
come
in
while
he
*NL*
was
murdering
her
sister
.
He
killed
them
with
an
axe
he
brought
with
*NL*
him
.
He
murdered
them
to
rob
them
and
he
did
rob
them
.
He
took
money
and
*NL*
various
things
...
He
told
all
this
,
word
for
word
,
to
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
*NL*
the
only
person
who
knows
his
secret
.
But
she
has
had
no
share
by
word
*NL*
or
deed
in
the
murder
;
she
was
as
horrified
at
it
as
you
are
now
.
Do
n't
*NL*
be
anxious
,
she
wo
n't
betray
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
,
''
muttered
Dounia
,
with
white
lips
.
She
gasped
for
breath
.
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
.
There
was
not
the
slightest
cause
,
no
sort
of
ground

*NL*
It
's
a
lie
,
a
lie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
robbed
her
,
that
was
the
cause
,
he
took
money
and
things
.
It
's
true
*NL*
that
by
his
own
admission
he
made
no
use
of
the
money
or
things
,
but
hid
*NL*
them
under
a
stone
,
where
they
are
now
.
But
that
was
because
he
dared
*NL*
not
make
use
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
could
he
steal
,
rob
?
How
could
he
dream
of
it
?
''
cried
Dounia
,
*NL*
and
she
jumped
up
from
the
chair
.
``
Why
,
you
know
him
,
and
you
've
seen
*NL*
him
,
can
he
be
a
thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
imploring
Svidrigailov
;
she
had
entirely
forgotten
her
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
thousands
and
millions
of
combinations
and
possibilities
,
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
A
thief
steals
and
knows
he
is
a
scoundrel
,
but
I
've
*NL*
heard
of
a
gentleman
who
broke
open
the
mail
.
Who
knows
,
very
likely
he
*NL*
thought
he
was
doing
a
gentlemanly
thing

Of
course
I
should
not
have
*NL*
believed
it
myself
if
I
'd
been
told
of
it
as
you
have
,
but
I
believe
my
*NL*
own
ears

He
explained
all
the
causes
of
it
to
Sofya
Semyonovna
too
,
but
*NL*
she
did
not
believe
her
ears
at
first
,
yet
she
believed
her
own
eyes
at
*NL*
last

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

were
the
causes
?

's
a
long
story

Avdotya
Romanovna

Here
's
...
how
shall
I
tell
*NL*
you
?
--
A
theory
of
a
sort
,
the
same
one
by
which
I
for
instance
consider
*NL*
that
a
single
misdeed
is
permissible
if
the
principal
aim
is
right
,
a
*NL*
solitary
wrongdoing
and
hundreds
of
good
deeds
!
It
's
galling
too
,
of
*NL*
course
,
for
a
young
man
of
gifts
and
overweening
pride
to
know
that
if
*NL*
he
had
,
for
instance
,
a
paltry
three
thousand
,
his
whole
career
,
his
*NL*
whole
future
would
be
differently
shaped
and
yet
not
to
have
that
three
*NL*
thousand
.
Add
to
that
,
nervous
irritability
from
hunger
,
from
lodging
*NL*
in
a
hole
,
from
rags
,
from
a
vivid
sense
of
the
charm
of
his
social
*NL*
position
and
his
sister
's
and
mother
's
position
too
.
Above
all
,
vanity
,
*NL*
pride
and
vanity
,
though
goodness
knows
he
may
have
good
qualities
*NL*
too
...
I
am
not
blaming
him
,
please
do
n't
think
it
;
besides
,
it
's
not
*NL*
my
business
.
A
special
little
theory
came
in
too
--
a
theory
of
a
*NL*
sort

dividing
mankind
,
you
see
,
into
material
and
superior
persons
,
*NL*
that
is
persons
to
whom
the
law
does
not
apply
owing
to
their
*NL*
superiority
,
who
make
laws
for
the
rest
of
mankind

the
material

that
*NL*

It
's
all
right
as
a

_
une

.
Napoleon
*NL*
attracted
him
tremendously
,
that
is
,
what
affected
him
was
that
a
*NL*
great
many
men
of
genius
have
not
hesitated
at
wrongdoing
,
but
have
*NL*
overstepped
the
law
without
thinking
about
it
.
He
seems
to
have
fancied
*NL*
that
he
was
a
genius
too
--
that
is
,
he
was
convinced
of
it
for
a
time
.
He
*NL*
has
suffered
a
great
deal
and
is
still
suffering
from
the
idea
that
he
*NL*
could
make
a
theory
,
but
was
incapable
of
boldly
overstepping
the
law
,
*NL*
and
so
he
is
not
a
man
of
genius
.
And
that
's
humiliating
for
a
young
man
*NL*
of
any
pride
,
in
our
day
especially
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
remorse
?
You
deny
him
any
moral
feeling
then
?
Is
he
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
everything
is
in
a
muddle
now
;
not
that
it
was
*NL*
ever
in
very
good
order
.
Russians
in
general
are
broad
in
their
ideas
,
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
,
broad
like
their
land
and
exceedingly
disposed
to
*NL*
the
fantastic
,
the
chaotic
.
But
it
's
a
misfortune
to
be
broad
without
*NL*
a
special
genius
.
Do
you
remember
what
a
lot
of
talk
we
had
together
on
*NL*
this
subject
,
sitting
in
the
evenings
on
the
terrace
after
supper
?
Why
,
*NL*
you
used
to
reproach
me
with
breadth
!
Who
knows
,
perhaps
we
were
talking
*NL*
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
lying
here
thinking
over
his
plan
.
There
*NL*
are
no
sacred
traditions
amongst
us
,
especially
in
the
educated
class
,
*NL*
Avdotya
Romanovna
.
At
the
best
someone
will
make
them
up
somehow
for
*NL*
himself
out
of
books
or
from
some
old
chronicle
.
But
those
are
for
the
*NL*
most
part
the
learned
and
all
old
fogeys
,
so
that
it
would
be
almost
*NL*
ill-bred
in
a
man
of
society
.
You
know
my
opinions
in
general
,
though
.
I
*NL*
never
blame
anyone
.
I
do
nothing
at
all
,
I
persevere
in
that
.
But
*NL*
we
've
talked
of
this
more
than
once
before

I
was
so
happy
indeed
as

interest
you
in
my
opinions

she
sank
on
to

made

broke

turning

She
rushed

to
the
furthest
corner

where
she
made
haste
to
barricade
herself
with
a

little
table

She
did
not
scream

she
fixed
her
eyes

tormentor

watched

every

Svidrigailov
remained
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
facing
her

*NL*
He
was
positively
composed
,
at

in
appearance

but
his
face
was
*NL*
pale
as
before

The
mocking
smile
did
not
leave
his
face

*NL*

've
taken
measures

not

Kapernaumovs
are
far

nothing

you

You

no

would

How

should
a

have
come
alone

visit

solitary
man
in

Dounia
indignantly

As
you

It

my
personal
conviction

you

perfectly

hateful

save

not
the

Suddenly

pulled
out

cocked

deadly
pale

measuring

distance

awaiting

lower
lip

white
and
quivering

big
black
eyes
flashed
like
fire

step
forward
and
a
shot
rang
out
.
The
*NL*
bullet
grazed
his
hair
and
flew
into
the
wall
behind
.
He
stood
still
and
*NL*
laughed
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wasp
has
stung
me
.
She
aimed
straight
at
my
head
.
What
's
this
?
*NL*
Blood
?
''
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
the
blood
,
which
flowed
*NL*
in
a
thin
stream
down
his
right
temple
.
The
bullet
seemed
to
have
just
*NL*
grazed
the
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
lowered
the
revolver
and
looked
at
Svidrigailov
not
so
much
in
*NL*
terror
as
in
a
sort
of
wild
amazement
.
She
seemed
not
to
understand
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
and
what
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
missed
!
Fire
again
,
I
'll
wait
,
''
said
Svidrigailov
softly
,
*NL*
still
smiling
,
but
gloomily
.
``
If
you
go
on
like
that
,
I
shall
have
time
*NL*
to
seize
you
before
you
cock
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
started
,
quickly
cocked
the
pistol
and
again
raised
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
,
''
she
cried
in
despair
.
``
I
swear
I
'll
shoot
again
.
I.
.
.
I
'll
*NL*
kill
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
...
at
three
paces
you
can
hardly
help
it
.
But
if
you
do
n't
...
*NL*
then
.
''
His
eyes
flashed
and
he
took
two
steps
forward
.
Dounia
shot
*NL*
again
:
it
missed
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
loaded
it
properly
.
Never
mind
,
you
have
another
charge
*NL*
there
.
Get
it
ready
,
I
'll
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
facing
her
,
two
paces
away
,
waiting
and
gazing
at
her
with
wild
*NL*
determination
,
with
feverishly
passionate
,
stubborn
,
set
eyes
.
Dounia
*NL*
saw
that
he
would
sooner
die
than
let
her
go
.
``
And
...
now
,
of
course
she
*NL*
would
kill
him
,
at
two
paces
!
''
Suddenly
she
flung
away
the
revolver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
dropped
it
!
''
said
Svidrigailov
with
surprise
,
and
he
drew
a
deep
*NL*
breath
.
A
weight
seemed
to
have
rolled
from
his
heart
--
perhaps
not
only
*NL*
the
fear
of
death
;
indeed
he
may
scarcely
have
felt
it
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
It
was
the
deliverance
from
another
feeling
,
darker
and
more
bitter
,
*NL*
which
he
could
not
himself
have
defined
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
Dounia
and
gently
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
She
did
not
*NL*
resist
,
but
,
trembling
like
a
leaf
,
looked
at
him
with
suppliant
eyes
.
*NL*
He
tried
to
say
something
,
but
his
lips
moved
without
being
able
to
*NL*
utter
a
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
,
''
Dounia
implored
.
Svidrigailov
shuddered
.
Her
voice
now
was
*NL*
quite
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
love
me
?
''
he
asked
softly
.
Dounia
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
...
and
you
ca
n't
?
Never
?
''
he
whispered
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
followed
a
moment
of
terrible
,
dumb
struggle
in
the
heart
of
*NL*
Svidrigailov
.
He
looked
at
her
with
an
indescribable
gaze
.
Suddenly
*NL*
he
withdrew
his
arm
,
turned
quickly
to
the
window
and
stood
facing
it
.
*NL*
Another
moment
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
out
of
the
left
pocket
of
his
coat
and
laid
it
on
the
table
*NL*
behind
him
,
without
turning
or
looking
at
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
!
Make
haste
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
stubbornly
out
of
the
window
.
Dounia
went
up
to
the
table
to
*NL*
take
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
!
Make
haste
!
''
repeated
Svidrigailov
,
still
without
turning
*NL*
or
moving
.
But
there
seemed
a
terrible
significance
in
the
tone
of
that
*NL*
``
make
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
understood
it
,
snatched
up
the
key
,
flew
to
the
door
,
unlocked
it
*NL*
quickly
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
A
minute
later
,
beside
herself
,
she
*NL*
ran
out
on
to
the
canal
bank
in
the
direction
of
X.
Bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
remained
three
minutes
standing
at
the
window
.
At
last
he
*NL*
slowly
turned
,
looked
about
him
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
.
A
*NL*
strange
smile
contorted
his
face
,
a
pitiful
,
sad
,
weak
smile
,
a
smile
of
*NL*
despair
.
The
blood
,
which
was
already
getting
dry
,
smeared
his
hand
.
*NL*
He
looked
angrily
at
it
,
then
wetted
a
towel
and
washed
his
temple
.
*NL*
The
revolver
which
Dounia
had
flung
away
lay
near
the
door
and
suddenly
*NL*
caught
his
eye
.
He
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
.
It
was
a
little
pocket
*NL*
three-barrel
revolver
of
old-fashioned
construction
.
There
were
still
*NL*
two
charges
and
one
capsule
left
in
it
.
It
could
be
fired
again
.
He
*NL*
thought
a
little
,
put
the
revolver
in
his
pocket
,
took
his
hat
and
went
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
that
evening
till
ten
o'clock
going
from
one
low
haunt
to
*NL*
another
.
Katia
too
turned
up
and
sang
another
gutter
song
,
how
a
certain
*NL*
*NL*
``
villain
and
tyrant
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
began
kissing
Katia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
treated
Katia
and
the
organ-grinder
and
some
singers
and
*NL*
the
waiters
and
two
little
clerks
.
He
was
particularly
drawn
to
these
*NL*
clerks
by
the
fact
that
they
both
had
crooked
noses
,
one
bent
to
the
*NL*
left
and
the
other
to
the
right
.
They
took
him
finally
to
a
pleasure
*NL*
garden
,
where
he
paid
for
their
entrance
.
There
was
one
lanky
*NL*
three-year-old
pine-tree
and
three
bushes
in
the
garden
,
besides
a
*NL*
``
Vauxhall
,
''
which
was
in
reality
a
drinking-bar
where
tea
too
was
*NL*
served
,
and
there
were
a
few
green
tables
and
chairs
standing
round
it
.
*NL*
A
chorus
of
wretched
singers
and
a
drunken
but
exceedingly
depressed
*NL*
German
clown
from
Munich
with
a
red
nose
entertained
the
public
.
The
*NL*
clerks
quarrelled
with
some
other
clerks
and
a
fight
seemed
imminent
.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
was
chosen
to
decide
the
dispute
.
He
listened
to
them
for
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
but
they
shouted
so
loud
that
there
was
no
*NL*
possibility
of
understanding
them
.
The
only
fact
that
seemed
certain
was
*NL*
that
one
of
them
had
stolen
something
and
had
even
succeeded
in
*NL*
selling
it
on
the
spot
to
a
Jew
,
but
would
not
share
the
spoil
with
his
*NL*
companion
.
Finally
it
appeared
that
the
stolen
object
was
a
teaspoon
*NL*
belonging
to
the
Vauxhall
.
It
was
missed
and
the
affair
began
to
seem
*NL*
troublesome
.
Svidrigailov
paid
for
the
spoon
,
got
up
,
and
walked
out
of
*NL*
the
garden
.
It
was
about
six
o'clock
.
He
had
not
drunk
a
drop
of
wine
*NL*
all
this
time
and
had
ordered
tea
more
for
the
sake
of
appearances
than
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dark
and
stifling
evening
.
Threatening
storm-clouds
came
over
*NL*
the
sky
about
ten
o'clock
.
There
was
a
clap
of
thunder
,
and
the
rain
*NL*
came
down
like
a
waterfall
.
The
water
fell
not
in
drops
,
but
beat
on
the
*NL*
earth
in
streams
.
There
were
flashes
of
lightning
every
minute
and
each
*NL*
flash
lasted
while
one
could
count
five
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drenched
to
the
skin
,
he
went
home
,
locked
himself
in
,
opened
the
*NL*
bureau
,
took
out
all
his
money
and
tore
up
two
or
three
papers
.
Then
,
*NL*
putting
the
money
in
his
pocket
,
he
was
about
to
change
his
clothes
,
*NL*
but
,
looking
out
of
the
window
and
listening
to
the
thunder
and
the
*NL*
rain
,
he
gave
up
the
idea
,
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
of
the
room
*NL*
without
locking
the
door
.
He
went
straight
to
Sonia
.
She
was
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
alone
:
the
four
Kapernaumov
children
were
with
her
.
She
*NL*
was
giving
them
tea
.
She
received
Svidrigailov
in
respectful
silence
,
*NL*
looking
wonderingly
at
his
soaking
clothes
.
The
children
all
ran
away
at
*NL*
once
in
indescribable
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
sat
down
at
the
table
and
asked
Sonia
to
sit
beside
him
.
*NL*
She
timidly
prepared
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
be
going
to
America
,
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
''
said
Svidrigailov
,
``
and
*NL*
as
I
am
probably
seeing
you
for
the
last
time
,
I
have
come
to
make
some
*NL*
arrangements
.
Well
,
did
you
see
the
lady
to-day
?
I
know
what
she
said
to
*NL*
you
,
you
need
not
tell
me
.
''
-LRB-
Sonia
made
a
movement
and
blushed
.
-RRB-
``
Those
*NL*
people
have
their
own
way
of
doing
things
.
As
to
your
sisters
and
your
*NL*
brother
,
they
are
really
provided
for
and
the
money
assigned
to
them
*NL*
I
've
put
into
safe
keeping
and
have
received
acknowledgments
.
You
had
*NL*
better
take
charge
of
the
receipts
,
in
case
anything
happens
.
Here
,
take
*NL*
them
!
Well
now
,
that
's
settled
.
Here
are
three
5-per-cent
bonds
to
the
*NL*
value
of
three
thousand
roubles
.
Take
those
for
yourself
,
entirely
for
*NL*
yourself
,
and
let
that
be
strictly
between
ourselves
,
so
that
no
one
*NL*
knows
of
it
,
whatever
you
hear
.
You
will
need
the
money
,
for
to
go
on
*NL*
living
in
the
old
way
,
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
is
bad

and
besides
there
is
no
*NL*
need

it
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
much
indebted
to
you
,
and
so
are
the
children
and
my
*NL*
stepmother

said
Sonia
hurriedly
,
``
and
if
I
've
said
so
little

please

do
n't
consider
...

I

very
grateful

I
do
n't

I

Rodion
Romanovitch

has
two
alternatives

a
bullet
in

brain
or
Siberia

''
-LRB-
Sonia
looked
*NL*
wildly
at
him
,
and
started
.
-RRB-
``
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
I
know
all
about
it
from
*NL*
himself
and
I
am
not
a
gossip
;
I
wo
n't
tell
anyone
.
It
was
good
advice
*NL*
when
you
told
him
to
give
himself
up
and
confess
.
It
would
be
much
*NL*
better
for
him
.
Well
,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
Siberia
,
he
will
go
and
*NL*
you
will
follow
him

That
's
so
,
is
n't
it

And
if
so
,
you
'll
need
money

*NL*
You
'll
need
it
for
him

do
you
understand

Giving
it
to
you
is
the
same
*NL*
as
my
giving
it
to
him

Besides
,
you
promised
Amalia
Ivanovna
to
pay
*NL*
what

owing

I
heard
you

How
can
you
undertake
such
obligations
so
*NL*
heedlessly

It
was
Katerina
Ivanovna

not

yours

you
ought
not

have
taken
any
notice
of
the
German
woman

do

anything

He
got
up

*NL*
Sonia
too
jumped
up
from
her
chair
and
looked
in
dismay
at
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
She
longed
to
speak
,
to
ask
a
question

for
the
first
moments
she
*NL*
did
not
dare

did
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
,
leaving
Sonia
in
a
state
of
wondering
anxiety
and
vague
*NL*
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
afterwards
that
on
the
same
evening
,
at
twenty
past
eleven
,
*NL*
he
made
another
very
eccentric
and
unexpected
visit
.
The
rain
still
*NL*
persisted
.
Drenched
to
the
skin
,
he
walked
into
the
little
flat
where
*NL*
the
parents
of
his
betrothed
lived
,
in
Third
Street
in
Vassilyevsky
*NL*
Island
.
He
knocked
some
time
before
he
was
admitted
,
and
his
visit
*NL*
at
first
caused
great
perturbation
;
but
Svidrigailov
could
be
*NL*
very
fascinating
when
he
liked
,
so
that
the
first
,
and
indeed
very
*NL*
intelligent
surmise
of
the
sensible
parents
that
Svidrigailov
had
*NL*
probably
had
so
much
to
drink
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
*NL*
vanished
immediately
.
The
decrepit
father
was
wheeled
in
to
see
*NL*
Svidrigailov
by
the
tender
and
sensible
mother
,
who
as
usual
began
the
*NL*
conversation
with
various
irrelevant
questions
.
She
never
asked
a
direct
*NL*
question
,
but
began
by
smiling
and
rubbing
her
hands
and
then
,
if
she
*NL*
were
obliged
to
ascertain
something
--
for
instance
,
when
Svidrigailov
*NL*
would
like
to
have
the
wedding
--
she
would
begin
by
interested
and
*NL*
almost
eager
questions
about
Paris
and
the
court
life
there
,
and
only
*NL*
by
degrees
brought
the
conversation
round
to
Third
Street
.
On
other
*NL*
occasions
this
had
of
course
been
very
impressive
,
but
this
time
Arkady
*NL*
Ivanovitch
seemed
particularly
impatient
,
and
insisted
on
seeing
his
*NL*
betrothed
at
once
,
though
he
had
been
informed
,
to
begin
with
,
that
she
*NL*
had
already
gone
to
bed
.
The
girl
of
course
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
informed
her
at
once
that
he
was
obliged
by
very
important
*NL*
affairs
to
leave
Petersburg
for
a
time
,
and
therefore
brought
her
*NL*
fifteen
thousand
roubles
and
begged
her
accept
them
as
a
present
from
*NL*
him
,
as
he
had
long
been
intending
to
make
her
this
trifling
present
*NL*
before
their
wedding
.
The
logical
connection
of
the
present
with
his
*NL*
immediate
departure
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
visiting
them
for
that
*NL*
purpose
in
pouring
rain
at
midnight
was
not
made
clear
.
But
it
all
went
*NL*
off
very
well
;
even
the
inevitable
ejaculations
of
wonder
and
regret
,
*NL*
the
inevitable
questions
were
extraordinarily
few
and
restrained
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
the
gratitude
expressed
was
most
glowing
and
was
reinforced
*NL*
by
tears
from
the
most
sensible
of
mothers
.
Svidrigailov
got
up
,
*NL*
laughed
,
kissed
his
betrothed
,
patted
her
cheek
,
declared
he
would
soon
*NL*
come
back
,
and
noticing
in
her
eyes
,
together
with
childish
curiosity
,
a
*NL*
sort
of
earnest
dumb
inquiry
,
reflected
and
kissed
her
again
,
though
*NL*
he
felt
sincere
anger
inwardly
at
the
thought
that
his
present
would
be
*NL*
immediately
locked
up
in
the
keeping
of
the
most
sensible
of
mothers
.
He
*NL*
went
away
,
leaving
them
all
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
excitement
,
but
*NL*
the
tender
mamma
,
speaking
quietly
in
a
half
whisper
,
settled
some
of
*NL*
the
most
important
of
their
doubts
,
concluding
that
Svidrigailov
was
*NL*
a
great
man
,
a
man
of
great
affairs
and
connections
and
of
great
*NL*
wealth
--
there
was
no
knowing
what
he
had
in
his
mind
.
He
would
start
*NL*
off
on
a
journey
and
give
away
money
just
as
the
fancy
took
him
,
so
that
*NL*
there
was
nothing
surprising
about
it
.
Of
course
it
was
strange
that
he
*NL*
was
wet
through
,
but
Englishmen
,
for
instance
,
are
even
more
eccentric
,
*NL*
and
all
these
people
of
high
society
did
n't
think
of
what
was
said
of
*NL*
them
and
did
n't
stand
on
ceremony
.
Possibly
,
indeed
,
he
came
like
that
*NL*
on
purpose
to
show
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
anyone
.
Above
all
,
not
a
*NL*
word
should
be
said
about
it
,
for
God
knows
what
might
come
of
it
,
and
*NL*
the
money
must
be
locked
up
,
and
it
was
most
fortunate
that
Fedosya
,
the
*NL*
cook
,
had
not
left
the
kitchen
.
And
above
all
not
a
word
must
be
said
*NL*
to
that
old
cat
,
Madame
Resslich
,
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
They
sat
up
*NL*
whispering
till
two
o'clock
,
but
the
girl
went
to
bed
much
earlier
,
*NL*
amazed
and
rather
sorrowful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
meanwhile
,
exactly
at
midnight
,
crossed
the
bridge
on
the
*NL*
way
back
to
the
mainland
.
The
rain
had
ceased
and
there
was
a
roaring
*NL*
wind
.
He
began
shivering
,
and
for
one
moment
he
gazed
at
the
black
*NL*
waters
of
the
Little
Neva
with
a
look
of
special
interest
,
even
inquiry
.
*NL*
But
he
soon
felt
it
very
cold
,
standing
by
the
water
;
he
turned
and
*NL*
went
towards
Y.
Prospect
.
He
walked
along
that
endless
street
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
almost
half
an
hour
,
more
than
once
stumbling
in
the
dark
on
the
*NL*
wooden
pavement
,
but
continually
looking
for
something
on
the
right
side
*NL*
of
the
street
.
He
had
noticed
passing
through
this
street
lately
that
*NL*
there
was
a
hotel
somewhere
towards
the
end
,
built
of
wood
,
but
fairly
*NL*
large
,
and
its
name
he
remembered
was
something
like
Adrianople
.
He
was
*NL*
not
mistaken
:
the
hotel
was
so
conspicuous
in
that
God-forsaken
place
*NL*
that
he
could
not
fail
to
see
it
even
in
the
dark
.
It
was
a
long
,
*NL*
blackened
wooden
building
,
and
in
spite
of
the
late
hour
there
were
*NL*
lights
in
the
windows
and
signs
of
life
within
.
He
went
in
and
asked
*NL*
a
ragged
fellow
who
met
him
in
the
corridor
for
a
room
.
The
latter
,
*NL*
scanning
Svidrigailov
,
pulled
himself
together
and
led
him
at
once
to
a
*NL*
close
and
tiny
room
in
the
distance
,
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
,
under
*NL*
the
stairs
.
There
was
no
other
,
all
were
occupied
.
The
ragged
fellow
*NL*
looked
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
tea
?
''
asked
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Veal
,
vodka
,
savouries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
me
tea
and
veal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
want
nothing
else
?
''
he
asked
with
apparent
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ragged
man
went
away
,
completely
disillusioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
a
nice
place
,
''
thought
Svidrigailov
.
``
How
was
it
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
it
?
I
expect
I
look
as
if
I
came
from
a
cafe
chantant
and
have
*NL*
had
some
adventure
on
the
way
.
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
who
stayed
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lighted
the
candle
and
looked
at
the
room
more
carefully
.
It
was
a
*NL*
room
so
low-pitched
that
Svidrigailov
could
only
just
stand
up
in
it
;
*NL*
it
had
one
window
;
the
bed
,
which
was
very
dirty
,
and
the
plain-stained
*NL*
chair
and
table
almost
filled
it
up
.
The
walls
looked
as
though
they
*NL*
were
made
of
planks
,
covered
with
shabby
paper
,
so
torn
and
dusty
*NL*
that
the
pattern
was
indistinguishable
,
though
the
general
*NL*
colour
--
yellow
--
could
still
be
made
out
.
One
of
the
walls
was
cut
short
*NL*
by
the
sloping
ceiling
,
though
the
room
was
not
an
attic
but
just
under
*NL*
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
set
down
the
candle
,
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
sank
into
*NL*
thought
.
But
a
strange
persistent
murmur
which
sometimes
rose
to
a
shout
*NL*
in
the
next
room
attracted
his
attention
.
The
murmur
had
not
ceased
from
*NL*
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
.
He
listened
:
someone
was
upbraiding
and
*NL*
almost
tearfully
scolding
,
but
he
heard
only
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
got
up
,
shaded
the
light
with
his
hand
and
at
once
he
saw
*NL*
light
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
;
he
went
up
and
peeped
through
.
The
*NL*
room
,
which
was
somewhat
larger
than
his
,
had
two
occupants
.
One
of
*NL*
them
,
a
very
curly-headed
man
with
a
red
inflamed
face
,
was
standing
*NL*
in
the
pose
of
an
orator
,
without
his
coat
,
with
his
legs
wide
apart
to
*NL*
preserve
his
balance
,
and
smiting
himself
on
the
breast
.
He
reproached
*NL*
the
other
with
being
a
beggar
,
with
having
no
standing
whatever
.
He
*NL*
declared
that
he
had
taken
the
other
out
of
the
gutter
and
he
could
turn
*NL*
him
out
when
he
liked
,
and
that
only
the
finger
of
Providence
sees
it
*NL*
all
.
The
object
of
his
reproaches
was
sitting
in
a
chair
,
and
had
the
*NL*
air
of
a
man
who
wants
dreadfully
to
sneeze
,
but
ca
n't
.
He
sometimes
*NL*
turned
sheepish
and
befogged
eyes
on
the
speaker
,
but
obviously
had
not
*NL*
the
slightest
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
and
scarcely
heard
it
.
A
*NL*
candle
was
burning
down
on
the
table
;
there
were
wine-glasses
,
a
nearly
*NL*
empty
bottle
of
vodka
,
bread
and
cucumber
,
and
glasses
with
the
dregs
*NL*
of
stale
tea
.
After
gazing
attentively
at
this
,
Svidrigailov
turned
away
*NL*
indifferently
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ragged
attendant
,
returning
with
the
tea
,
could
not
resist
asking
*NL*
him
again
whether
he
did
n't
want
anything
more
,
and
again
receiving
a
*NL*
negative
reply
,
finally
withdrew
.
Svidrigailov
made
haste
to
drink
a
*NL*
glass
of
tea
to
warm
himself
,
but
could
not
eat
anything
.
He
began
*NL*
to
feel
feverish
.
He
took
off
his
coat
and
,
wrapping
himself
in
the
*NL*
blanket
,
lay
down
on
the
bed
.
He
was
annoyed
.
``
It
would
have
been
better
*NL*
to
be
well
for
the
occasion
,
''
he
thought
with
a
smile
.
The
room
was
*NL*
close
,
the
candle
burnt
dimly
,
the
wind
was
roaring
outside
,
he
heard
*NL*
a
mouse
scratching
in
the
corner
and
the
room
smelt
of
mice
and
of
*NL*
leather
.
He
lay
in
a
sort
of
reverie
:
one
thought
followed
another
.
He
*NL*
felt
a
longing
to
fix
his
imagination
on
something
.
``
It
must
be
a
garden
*NL*
under
the
window
,
''
he
thought
.
``
There
's
a
sound
of
trees
.
How
I
dislike
*NL*
the
sound
of
trees
on
a
stormy
night
,
in
the
dark
!
They
give
one
a
*NL*
horrid
feeling
.
''
He
remembered
how
he
had
disliked
it
when
he
passed
*NL*
Petrovsky
Park
just
now
.
This
reminded
him
of
the
bridge
over
the
Little
*NL*
Neva
and
he
felt
cold
again
as
he
had
when
standing
there
.
``
I
never
have
*NL*
liked
water
,
''
he
thought
,
``
even
in
a
landscape
,
''
and
he
suddenly
smiled
*NL*
again
at
a
strange
idea
:
``
Surely
now
all
these
questions
of
taste
and
*NL*
comfort
ought
not
to
matter
,
but
I
've
become
more
particular
,
like
an
*NL*
animal
that
picks
out
a
special
place
...
for
such
an
occasion
.
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
gone
into
the
Petrovsky
Park
!
I
suppose
it
seemed
dark
,
cold
,
*NL*
ha-ha
!
As
though
I
were
seeking
pleasant
sensations
!
...
By
the
way
,
why
*NL*
have
n't
I
put
out
the
candle
?
''
he
blew
it
out
.
``
They
've
gone
to
bed
next
*NL*
door
,
''
he
thought
,
not
seeing
the
light
at
the
crack
.
``
Well
,
now
,
Marfa
*NL*
Petrovna
,
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
turn
up
;
it
's
dark
,
and
the
very
*NL*
time
and
place
for
you
.
But
now
you
wo
n't
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
recalled
how
,
an
hour
before
carrying
out
his
design
on
*NL*
Dounia
,
he
had
recommended
Raskolnikov
to
trust
her
to
Razumihin
's
*NL*
keeping
.
``
I
suppose
I
really
did
say
it
,
as
Raskolnikov
guessed
,
to
*NL*
tease
myself
.
But
what
a
rogue
that
Raskolnikov
is
!
He
's
gone
through
a
*NL*
good
deal
.
He
may
be
a
successful
rogue
in
time
when
he
's
got
over
*NL*
his
nonsense
.
But
now
he
's
_
too
_
eager
for
life
.
These
young
men
*NL*
are
contemptible
on
that
point
.
But
,
hang
the
fellow
!
Let
him
please
*NL*
himself
,
it
's
nothing
to
do
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
get
to
sleep
.
By
degrees
Dounia
's
image
rose
before
him
,
*NL*
and
a
shudder
ran
over
him
.
``
No
,
I
must
give
up
all
that
now
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
rousing
himself
.
``
I
must
think
of
something
else
.
It
's
queer
*NL*
and
funny
.
I
never
had
a
great
hatred
for
anyone
,
I
never
particularly
*NL*
desired
to
avenge
myself
even
,
and
that
's
a
bad
sign
,
a
bad
sign
,
a
bad
*NL*
sign
.
I
never
liked
quarrelling
either
,
and
never
lost
my
temper
--
that
's
*NL*
a
bad
sign
too
.
And
the
promises
I
made
her
just
now
,
too
--
Damnation
!
*NL*
But
--
who
knows
?
--
perhaps
she
would
have
made
a
new
man
of
me
*NL*
somehow
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ground
his
teeth
and
sank
into
silence
again
.
Again
Dounia
's
image
*NL*
rose
before
him
,
just
as
she
was
when
,
after
shooting
the
first
time
,
*NL*
she
had
lowered
the
revolver
in
terror
and
gazed
blankly
at
him
,
so
that
*NL*
he
might
have
seized
her
twice
over
and
she
would
not
have
lifted
a
hand
*NL*
to
defend
herself
if
he
had
not
reminded
her
.
He
recalled
how
at
that
*NL*
instant
he
felt
almost
sorry
for
her
,
how
he
had
felt
a
pang
at
his
*NL*
heart
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aie
!
Damnation
,
these
thoughts
again
!
I
must
put
it
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dozing
off
;
the
feverish
shiver
had
ceased
,
when
suddenly
*NL*
something
seemed
to
run
over
his
arm
and
leg
under
the
bedclothes
.
He
*NL*
started
.
``
Ugh
!
hang
it
!
I
believe
it
's
a
mouse
,
''
he
thought
,
``
that
's
the
*NL*
veal
I
left
on
the
table
.
''
He
felt
fearfully
disinclined
to
pull
off
the
*NL*
blanket
,
get
up
,
get
cold
,
but
all
at
once
something
unpleasant
ran
over
*NL*
his
leg
again
.
He
pulled
off
the
blanket
and
lighted
the
candle
.
Shaking
*NL*
with
feverish
chill
he
bent
down
to
examine
the
bed
:
there
was
nothing
.
*NL*
He
shook
the
blanket
and
suddenly
a
mouse
jumped
out
on
the
sheet
.
*NL*
He
tried
to
catch
it
,
but
the
mouse
ran
to
and
fro
in
zigzags
without
*NL*
leaving
the
bed
,
slipped
between
his
fingers
,
ran
over
his
hand
and
*NL*
suddenly
darted
under
the
pillow
.
He
threw
down
the
pillow
,
but
in
one
*NL*
instant
felt
something
leap
on
his
chest
and
dart
over
his
body
and
down
*NL*
his
back
under
his
shirt
.
He
trembled
nervously
and
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
dark
.
He
was
lying
on
the
bed
and
wrapped
up
in
the
blanket
*NL*
as
before
.
The
wind
was
howling
under
the
window
.
``
How
disgusting
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
with
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bedstead
with
his
back
to
the
*NL*
window
.
``
It
's
better
not
to
sleep
at
all
,
''
he
decided
.
There
was
a
cold
*NL*
damp
draught
from
the
window
,
however
;
without
getting
up
he
drew
the
*NL*
blanket
over
him
and
wrapped
himself
in
it
.
He
was
not
thinking
of
*NL*
anything
and
did
not
want
to
think
.
But
one
image
rose
after
another
,
*NL*
incoherent
scraps
of
thought
without
beginning
or
end
passed
through
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
sank
into
drowsiness
.
Perhaps
the
cold
,
or
the
dampness
,
or
*NL*
the
dark
,
or
the
wind
that
howled
under
the
window
and
tossed
the
trees
*NL*
roused
a
sort
of
persistent
craving
for
the
fantastic
.
He
kept
dwelling
*NL*
on
images
of
flowers
,
he
fancied
a
charming
flower
garden
,
a
bright
,
*NL*
warm
,
almost
hot
day
,
a
holiday
--
Trinity
day
.
A
fine
,
sumptuous
country
*NL*
cottage
in
the
English
taste
overgrown
with
fragrant
flowers
,
with
*NL*
flower
beds
going
round
the
house
;
the
porch
,
wreathed
in
climbers
,
was
*NL*
surrounded
with
beds
of
roses
.
A
light
,
cool
staircase
,
carpeted
with
*NL*
rich
rugs
,
was
decorated
with
rare
plants
in
china
pots
.
He
noticed
*NL*
particularly
in
the
windows
nosegays
of
tender
,
white
,
heavily
fragrant
*NL*
narcissus
bending
over
their
bright
,
green
,
thick
long
stalks
.
He
was
*NL*
reluctant
to
move
away
from
them
,
but
he
went
up
the
stairs
and
came
*NL*
into
a
large
,
high
drawing-room
and
again
everywhere
--
at
the
windows
,
*NL*
the
doors
on
to
the
balcony
,
and
on
the
balcony
itself
--
were
flowers
.
*NL*
The
floors
were
strewn
with
freshly-cut
fragrant
hay
,
the
windows
*NL*
were
open
,
a
fresh
,
cool
,
light
air
came
into
the
room
.
The
birds
were
*NL*
chirruping
under
the
window
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
on
a
table
*NL*
covered
with
a
white
satin
shroud
,
stood
a
coffin
.
The
coffin
was
*NL*
covered
with
white
silk
and
edged
with
a
thick
white
frill
;
wreaths
of
*NL*
flowers
surrounded
it
on
all
sides
.
Among
the
flowers
lay
a
girl
in
a
*NL*
white
muslin
dress
,
with
her
arms
crossed
and
pressed
on
her
bosom
,
as
*NL*
though
carved
out
of
marble
.
But
her
loose
fair
hair
was
wet
;
there
was
*NL*
a
wreath
of
roses
on
her
head
.
The
stern
and
already
rigid
profile
of
*NL*
her
face
looked
as
though
chiselled
of
marble
too
,
and
the
smile
on
her
*NL*
pale
lips
was
full
of
an
immense
unchildish
misery
and
sorrowful
appeal
.
*NL*
Svidrigailov
knew
that
girl
;
there
was
no
holy
image
,
no
burning
candle
*NL*
beside
the
coffin
;
no
sound
of
prayers
:
the
girl
had
drowned
herself
.
*NL*
She
was
only
fourteen
,
but
her
heart
was
broken
.
And
she
had
destroyed
*NL*
herself
,
crushed
by
an
insult
that
had
appalled
and
amazed
that
childish
*NL*
soul
,
had
smirched
that
angel
purity
with
unmerited
disgrace
and
torn
*NL*
from
her
a
last
scream
of
despair
,
unheeded
and
brutally
disregarded
,
on
*NL*
a
dark
night
in
the
cold
and
wet
while
the
wind
howled
...
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
came
to
himself
,
got
up
from
the
bed
and
went
to
the
*NL*
window
.
He
felt
for
the
latch
and
opened
it
.
The
wind
lashed
furiously
*NL*
into
the
little
room
and
stung
his
face
and
his
chest
,
only
covered
with
*NL*
his
shirt
,
as
though
with
frost
.
Under
the
window
there
must
have
been
*NL*
something
like
a
garden
,
and
apparently
a
pleasure
garden
.
There
,
too
,
*NL*
probably
there
were
tea-tables
and
singing
in
the
daytime
.
Now
drops
of
*NL*
rain
flew
in
at
the
window
from
the
trees
and
bushes
;
it
was
dark
as
*NL*
in
a
cellar
,
so
that
he
could
only
just
make
out
some
dark
blurs
of
*NL*
objects
.
Svidrigailov
,
bending
down
with
elbows
on
the
window-sill
,
*NL*
gazed
for
five
minutes
into
the
darkness
;
the
boom
of
a
cannon
,
followed
*NL*
by
a
second
one
,
resounded
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
``
Ah
,
the
*NL*
signal
!
The
river
is
overflowing
,
''
he
thought
.
``
By
morning
it
will
be
*NL*
swirling
down
the
street
in
the
lower
parts
,
flooding
the
basements
and
*NL*
cellars
.
The
cellar
rats
will
swim
out
,
and
men
will
curse
in
the
rain
*NL*
and
wind
as
they
drag
their
rubbish
to
their
upper
storeys
.
What
time
is
*NL*
it
now
?
''
And
he
had
hardly
thought
it
when
,
somewhere
near
,
a
clock
on
*NL*
the
wall
,
ticking
away
hurriedly
,
struck
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
It
will
be
light
in
an
hour
!
Why
wait
?
I
'll
go
out
at
once
*NL*
straight
to
the
park
.
I
'll
choose
a
great
bush
there
drenched
with
rain
,
*NL*
so
that
as
soon
as
one
's
shoulder
touches
it
,
millions
of
drops
drip
on
*NL*
one
's
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
away
from
the
window
,
shut
it
,
lighted
the
candle
,
put
on
his
*NL*
waistcoat
,
his
overcoat
and
his
hat
and
went
out
,
carrying
the
candle
,
*NL*
into
the
passage
to
look
for
the
ragged
attendant
who
would
be
asleep
*NL*
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
candle-ends
and
all
sorts
of
rubbish
,
to
pay
*NL*
him
for
the
room
and
leave
the
hotel
.
``
It
's
the
best
minute
;
I
could
n't
*NL*
choose
a
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
for
some
time
through
a
long
narrow
corridor
without
finding
*NL*
anyone
and
was
just
going
to
call
out
,
when
suddenly
in
a
dark
corner
*NL*
between
an
old
cupboard
and
the
door
he
caught
sight
of
a
strange
object
*NL*
which
seemed
to
be
alive
.
He
bent
down
with
the
candle
and
saw
a
little
*NL*
girl
,
not
more
than
five
years
old
,
shivering
and
crying
,
with
her
*NL*
clothes
as
wet
as
a
soaking
house-flannel
.
She
did
not
seem
afraid
of
*NL*
Svidrigailov
,
but
looked
at
him
with
blank
amazement
out
of
her
big
*NL*
black
eyes
.
Now
and
then
she
sobbed
as
children
do
when
they
have
been
*NL*
crying
a
long
time
,
but
are
beginning
to
be
comforted
.
The
child
's
face
*NL*
was
pale
and
tired
,
she
was
numb
with
cold
.
``
How
can
she
have
come
here
?
*NL*
She
must
have
hidden
here
and
not
slept
all
night
.
''
He
began
questioning
*NL*
her
.
The
child
suddenly
becoming
animated
,
chattered
away
in
her
baby
*NL*
language
,
something
about
``
mammy
''
and
that
``
mammy
would
beat
her
,
''
and
*NL*
about
some
cup
that
she
had
``
bwoken
.
''
The
child
chattered
on
without
*NL*
stopping
.
He
could
only
guess
from
what
she
said
that
she
was
a
*NL*
neglected
child
,
whose
mother
,
probably
a
drunken
cook
,
in
the
service
*NL*
of
the
hotel
,
whipped
and
frightened
her
;
that
the
child
had
broken
*NL*
a
cup
of
her
mother
's
and
was
so
frightened
that
she
had
run
away
the
*NL*
evening
before
,
had
hidden
for
a
long
while
somewhere
outside
in
the
*NL*
rain
,
at
last
had
made
her
way
in
here
,
hidden
behind
the
cupboard
and
*NL*
spent
the
night
there
,
crying
and
trembling
from
the
damp
,
the
darkness
*NL*
and
the
fear
that
she
would
be
badly
beaten
for
it
.
He
took
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
went
back
to
his
room
,
sat
her
on
the
bed
,
and
began
undressing
*NL*
her
.
The
torn
shoes
which
she
had
on
her
stockingless
feet
were
as
*NL*
wet
as
if
they
had
been
standing
in
a
puddle
all
night
.
When
he
had
*NL*
undressed
her
,
he
put
her
on
the
bed
,
covered
her
up
and
wrapped
her
in
*NL*
the
blanket
from
her
head
downwards
.
She
fell
asleep
at
once
.
Then
he
*NL*
sank
into
dreary
musing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
folly
to
trouble
myself
,
''
he
decided
suddenly
with
an
oppressive
*NL*
feeling
of
annoyance
.
``
What
idiocy
!
''
In
vexation
he
took
up
the
candle
*NL*
to
go
and
look
for
the
ragged
attendant
again
and
make
haste
to
go
away
.
*NL*
``
Damn
the
child
!
''
he
thought
as
he
opened
the
door
,
but
he
turned
again
*NL*
to
see
whether
the
child
was
asleep
.
He
raised
the
blanket
carefully
.
*NL*
The
child
was
sleeping
soundly
,
she
had
got
warm
under
the
blanket
,
*NL*
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
flushed
.
But
strange
to
say
that
flush
seemed
*NL*
brighter
and
coarser
than
the
rosy
cheeks
of
childhood
.
``
It
's
a
flush
*NL*
of
fever
,
''
thought
Svidrigailov
.
It
was
like
the
flush
from
drinking
,
as
*NL*
though
she
had
been
given
a
full
glass
to
drink
.
Her
crimson
lips
were
*NL*
hot
and
glowing
;
but
what
was
this
?
He
suddenly
fancied
that
her
long
*NL*
black
eyelashes
were
quivering
,
as
though
the
lids
were
opening
and
a
*NL*
sly
crafty
eye
peeped
out
with
an
unchildlike
wink
,
as
though
the
little
*NL*
girl
were
not
asleep
,
but
pretending
.
Yes
,
it
was
so
.
Her
lips
parted
in
*NL*
a
smile
.
The
corners
of
her
mouth
quivered
,
as
though
she
were
trying
to
*NL*
control
them
.
But
now
she
quite
gave
up
all
effort
,
now
it
was
a
grin
,
*NL*
a
broad
grin
;
there
was
something
shameless
,
provocative
in
that
quite
*NL*
unchildish
face
;
it
was
depravity
,
it
was
the
face
of
a
harlot
,
the
*NL*
shameless
face
of
a
French
harlot
.
Now
both
eyes
opened
wide
;
they
*NL*
turned
a
glowing
,
shameless
glance
upon
him
;
they
laughed
,
invited
*NL*
him
...
There
was
something
infinitely
hideous
and
shocking
in
that
*NL*
laugh
,
in
those
eyes
,
in
such
nastiness
in
the
face
of
a
child
.
``
What
,
*NL*
at
five
years
old
?
''
Svidrigailov
muttered
in
genuine
horror
.
``
What
does
*NL*
it
mean
?
''
And
now
she
turned
to
him
,
her
little
face
all
aglow
,
holding
*NL*
out
her
arms
...
``
Accursed
child
!
''
Svidrigailov
cried
,
raising
his
hand
*NL*
to
strike
her
,
but
at
that
moment
he
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
same
bed
,
still
wrapped
in
the
blanket
.
The
candle
had
not
*NL*
been
lighted
,
and
daylight
was
streaming
in
at
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
nightmare
all
night
!
''
He
got
up
angrily
,
feeling
utterly
*NL*
shattered
;
his
bones
ached
.
There
was
a
thick
mist
outside
and
he
could
*NL*
see
nothing
.
It
was
nearly
five
.
He
had
overslept
himself
!
He
got
up
,
*NL*
put
on
his
still
damp
jacket
and
overcoat
.
Feeling
the
revolver
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
he
took
it
out
and
then
he
sat
down
,
took
a
notebook
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
and
in
the
most
conspicuous
place
on
the
title
page
wrote
a
few
*NL*
lines
in
large
letters
.
Reading
them
over
,
he
sank
into
thought
with
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
table
.
The
revolver
and
the
notebook
lay
beside
him
.
Some
*NL*
flies
woke
up
and
settled
on
the
untouched
veal
,
which
was
still
on
*NL*
the
table
.
He
stared
at
them
and
at
last
with
his
free
right
hand
began
*NL*
trying
to
catch
one
.
He
tried
till
he
was
tired
,
but
could
not
catch
it
.
*NL*
At
last
,
realising
that
he
was
engaged
in
this
interesting
pursuit
,
he
*NL*
started
,
got
up
and
walked
resolutely
out
of
the
room
.
A
minute
later
he
*NL*
was
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thick
milky
mist
hung
over
the
town
.
Svidrigailov
walked
along
the
*NL*
slippery
dirty
wooden
pavement
towards
the
Little
Neva
.
He
was
picturing
*NL*
the
waters
of
the
Little
Neva
swollen
in
the
night
,
Petrovsky
Island
,
*NL*
the
wet
paths
,
the
wet
grass
,
the
wet
trees
and
bushes
and
at
last
the
*NL*
bush
...
He
began
ill-humouredly
staring
at
the
houses
,
trying
to
think
*NL*
of
something
else
.
There
was
not
a
cabman
or
a
passer-by
in
the
street
.
*NL*
The
bright
yellow
,
wooden
,
little
houses
looked
dirty
and
dejected
with
*NL*
their
closed
shutters
.
The
cold
and
damp
penetrated
his
whole
body
and
*NL*
he
began
to
shiver
.
From
time
to
time
he
came
across
shop
signs
and
read
*NL*
each
carefully
.
At
last
he
reached
the
end
of
the
wooden
pavement
and
*NL*
came
to
a
big
stone
house
.
A
dirty
,
shivering
dog
crossed
his
path
with
*NL*
its
tail
between
its
legs
.
A
man
in
a
greatcoat
lay
face
downwards
;
dead
*NL*
drunk
,
across
the
pavement
.
He
looked
at
him
and
went
on
.
A
high
tower
*NL*
stood
up
on
the
left
.
``
Bah
!
''
he
shouted
,
``
here
is
a
place
.
Why
should
*NL*
it
be
Petrovsky
?
It
will
be
in
the
presence
of
an
official
witness
*NL*
anyway
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
almost
smiled
at
this
new
thought
and
turned
into
the
street
where
*NL*
there
was
the
big
house
with
the
tower
.
At
the
great
closed
gates
of
*NL*
the
house
,
a
little
man
stood
with
his
shoulder
leaning
against
them
,
*NL*
wrapped
in
a
grey
soldier
's
coat
,
with
a
copper
Achilles
helmet
on
his
*NL*
head
.
He
cast
a
drowsy
and
indifferent
glance
at
Svidrigailov
.
His
*NL*
face
wore
that
perpetual
look
of
peevish
dejection
,
which
is
so
sourly
*NL*
printed
on
all
faces
of
Jewish
race
without
exception
.
They
both
,
*NL*
Svidrigailov
and
Achilles
,
stared
at
each
other
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
without
speaking
.
At
last
it
struck
Achilles
as
irregular
for
a
man
*NL*
not
drunk
to
be
standing
three
steps
from
him
,
staring
and
not
saying
a
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
here
?
''
he
said
,
without
moving
or
changing
his
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
brother
,
good
morning
,
''
answered
Svidrigailov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
n't
the
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going

To

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
America

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
America

''
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
took
out
the
revolver
and
cocked
it
.
Achilles
raised
his
*NL*
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
such
jokes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
it
be
the
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
brother
,
I
do
n't
mind
that

It
's
a
good
place

When
you
are
*NL*
asked
,
you
just
say
he
was
going

he
said
,
to
America

*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
revolver
to
his
right
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
do
it
here

it

cried
Achilles
,
rousing
*NL*
himself
,
his
eyes
growing
bigger
and
bigger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Svidrigailov
pulled
the

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
,
about
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
Raskolnikov
was
on
*NL*
his
way
to
his
mother
's
and
sister
's
lodging
--
the
lodging
in
Bakaleyev
's
*NL*
house
which
Razumihin
had
found
for
them
.
The
stairs
went
up
from
*NL*
the
street
.
Raskolnikov
walked
with
lagging
steps
,
as
though
still
*NL*
hesitating
whether
to
go
or
not
.
But
nothing
would
have
turned
him
back
:
*NL*
his
decision
was
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
it
does
n't
matter
,
they
still
know
nothing
,
''
he
thought
,
``
and
*NL*
they
are
used
to
thinking
of
me
as
eccentric
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
appallingly
dressed
:
his
clothes
torn
and
dirty
,
soaked
with
a
*NL*
night
's
rain
.
His
face
was
almost
distorted
from
fatigue
,
exposure
,
the
*NL*
inward
conflict
that
had
lasted
for
twenty-four
hours
.
He
had
spent
all
*NL*
the
previous
night
alone
,
God
knows
where
.
But
anyway
he
had
reached
a
*NL*
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
opened
by
his
mother
.
Dounia
was
not
*NL*
at
home
.
Even
the
servant
happened
to
be
out
.
At
first
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
was
speechless
with
joy
and
surprise
;
then
she
took
him
by
*NL*
the
hand
and
drew
him
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
!
''
she
began
,
faltering
with
joy
.
``
Do
n't
be
angry
with
*NL*
me
,
Rodya
,
for
welcoming
you
so
foolishly
with
tears
:
I
am
laughing
not
*NL*
crying
.
Did
you
think
I
was
crying
?
No
,
I
am
delighted
,
but
I
've
got
*NL*
into
such
a
stupid
habit
of
shedding
tears
.
I
've
been
like
that
ever
*NL*
since
your
father
's
death
.
I
cry
for
anything
.
Sit
down
,
dear
boy
,
you
*NL*
must
be
tired
;
I
see
you
are
.
Ah
,
how
muddy
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
the
rain
yesterday
,
mother
...
''
Raskolnikov
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
hurriedly
interrupted
,
``
you
thought
I
*NL*
was
going
to
cross-question
you
in
the
womanish
way
I
used
to
;
do
n't
be
*NL*
anxious
,
I
understand
,
I
understand
it
all
:
now
I
've
learned
the
ways
*NL*
here
and
truly
I
see
for
myself
that
they
are
better
.
I
've
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
once
for
all
:
how
could
I
understand
your
plans
and
expect
you
to
*NL*
give
an
account
of
them
?
God
knows
what
concerns
and
plans
you
may
have
,
*NL*
or
what
ideas
you
are
hatching
;
so
it
's
not
for
me
to
keep
nudging
your
*NL*
elbow
,
asking
you
what
you
are
thinking
about
?
But
,
my
goodness
!
why
*NL*
am
I
running
to
and
fro
as
though
I
were
crazy
...
?
I
am
reading
your
*NL*
article
in
the
magazine
for
the
third
time
,
Rodya
.
Dmitri
Prokofitch
*NL*
brought
it
to
me
.
Directly
I
saw
it
I
cried
out
to
myself
:
`
There
,
*NL*
foolish
one
,
'
I
thought
,
`
that
's
what
he
is
busy
about
;
that
's
the
*NL*
solution
of
the
mystery
!
Learned
people
are
always
like
that
.
He
may
*NL*
have
some
new
ideas
in
his
head
just
now
;
he
is
thinking
them
over
and
I
*NL*
worry
him
and
upset
him
.
'
I
read
it
,
my
dear
,
and
of
course
there
was
a
*NL*
great
deal
I
did
not
understand
;
but
that
's
only
natural
--
how
should
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
me
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
took
the
magazine
and
glanced
at
his
article
.
Incongruous
*NL*
as
it
was
with
his
mood
and
his
circumstances
,
he
felt
that
strange
and
*NL*
bitter
sweet
sensation
that
every
author
experiences
the
first
time
he
*NL*
sees
himself
in
print
;
besides
,
he
was
only
twenty-three
.
It
lasted
only
*NL*
a
moment
.
After
reading
a
few
lines
he
frowned
and
his
heart
throbbed
*NL*
with
anguish
.
He
recalled
all
the
inward
conflict
of
the
preceding
*NL*
months
.
He
flung
the
article
on
the
table
with
disgust
and
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
however
foolish
I
may
be
,
Rodya
,
I
can
see
for
myself
that
you
*NL*
will
very
soon
be
one
of
the
leading
--
if
not
the
leading
man
--
in
the
*NL*
world
of
Russian
thought
.
And
they
dared
to
think
you
were
mad
!
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
,
but
they
really
thought
that
.
Ah
,
the
despicable
creatures
,
*NL*
how
could
they
understand
genius
!
And
Dounia
,
Dounia
was
all
but
*NL*
believing
it
--
what
do
you
say
to
that
?
Your
father
sent
twice
to
*NL*
magazines
--
the
first
time
poems
-LRB-
I
've
got
the
manuscript
and
will
show
*NL*
you
-RRB-
and
the
second
time
a
whole
novel
-LRB-
I
begged
him
to
let
me
copy
it
*NL*
out
-RRB-
and
how
we
prayed
that
they
should
be
taken
--
they
were
n't
!
I
was
*NL*
breaking
my
heart
,
Rodya
,
six
or
seven
days
ago
over
your
food
and
your
*NL*
clothes
and
the
way
you
are
living
.
But
now
I
see
again
how
foolish
*NL*
I
was
,
for
you
can
attain
any
position
you
like
by
your
intellect
and
*NL*
talent
.
No
doubt
you
do
n't
care
about
that
for
the
present
and
you
are
*NL*
occupied
with
much
more
important
matters

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dounia

*NL*
*NL*

No

I
often
do

Dmitri

Prokofitch
comes
to
see
me
,
it
's
so
good
of
him
,
and
he
always
talks
*NL*
about
you
.
He
loves
you
and
respects
you
,
my
dear
.
I
do
n't
say
that
*NL*
Dounia
is
very
wanting
in
consideration
.
I
am
not
complaining
.
She
has
*NL*
her
ways
and
I
have
mine
;
she
seems
to
have
got
some
secrets
of
late
and
*NL*
I
never
have
any
secrets
from
you
two

Of
course
,
I
am
sure
that
Dounia
*NL*
has
far
too
much
sense

besides
she
loves
you

I
do

know
what
it

all
lead
to

made

happy

coming

she
has
missed
you
by
going
out

'll
tell

her

I

read

I
shall
hear
about
you
from
everyone

sometimes
you

come
yourself

pressing

to

weeping
gently

Yes

was
alone

For
the
first
time
after
all

awful

his
heart
was
softened

He
fell
down
before
her
,
he
kissed
her

feet
and
both
wept
,
embracing
.
And
she
was
not
surprised
and
did
not
*NL*
question
him
this
time

For
some
days
she
had
realised
that
something
*NL*
awful
was
happening
to
her

now
some
terrible
minute

come

now
you

as
when
you
were

You
would
run

kiss
me

When
your
father
was
living

we
were
poor

you
comforted
us

simply
by
being
with

when
I
buried
your

how
often
we
*NL*
wept
together
at
his
grave

embraced

been
crying

lately

it

that
my

arrived
*NL*
here
,
I
guessed
simply
from
your
eyes
.
My
heart
sank
at
once
,
and
to-day
*NL*
when
I
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
you
,
I
thought
the
fatal
hour
had
*NL*
come
.
Rodya
,
Rodya
,
you
are
not
going
away
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
come
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rodya
,
do
n't
be
angry
,
I
do
n't
dare
to
question
you
.
I
know
I
must
n't
.
*NL*
Only
say
two
words
to
me
--
is
it
far
where
you
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
awaiting
you
there
?
Some
post
or
career
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
God
sends
...
only
pray
for
me
.
''
Raskolnikov
went
to
the
door
,
but
*NL*
she
clutched
him
and
gazed
despairingly
into
his
eyes
.
Her
face
worked
*NL*
with
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
mother
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
deeply
regretting
that
he
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
ever
,
it
's
not
yet
for
ever
?
You
'll
come
,
you
'll
come
*NL*
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
I
will
,
good-bye
.
''
He
tore
himself
away
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
,
fresh
,
bright
evening
;
it
had
cleared
up
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
to
his
lodgings
;
he
made
haste
.
He
wanted
to
finish
all
*NL*
before
sunset
.
He
did
not
want
to
meet
anyone
till
then
.
Going
up
the
*NL*
stairs
he
noticed
that
Nastasya
rushed
from
the
samovar
to
watch
him
*NL*
intently
.
``
Can
anyone
have
come
to
see
me
?
''
he
wondered
.
He
had
a
*NL*
disgusted
vision
of
Porfiry
.
But
opening
his
door
he
saw
Dounia
.
She
*NL*
was
sitting
alone
,
plunged
in
deep
thought
,
and
looked
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
waiting
a
long
time
.
He
stopped
short
in
the
doorway
.
She
rose
from
*NL*
the
sofa
in
dismay
and
stood
up
facing
him
.
Her
eyes
,
fixed
upon
him
,
*NL*
betrayed
horror
and
infinite
grief
.
And
from
those
eyes
alone
he
saw
at
*NL*
once
that
she
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
come
in
or
go
away
?
''
he
asked
uncertainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
all
day
with
Sofya
Semyonovna
.
We
were
both
waiting
for
you
.
*NL*
We
thought
that
you
would
be
sure
to
come
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
went
into
the
room
and
sank
exhausted
on
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
weak
,
Dounia
,
I
am
very
tired
;
and
I
should
have
liked
at
this
*NL*
moment
to
be
able
to
control
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
mistrustfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
all
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
clearly
.
You
see
,
sister
,
I
wanted
to
make
up
my
mind
*NL*
once
for
all
,
and
several
times
I
walked
by
the
Neva
,
I
remember
that
*NL*
I
wanted
to
end
it
all
there
,
but
...
I
could
n't
make
up
my
mind
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
,
looking
at
her
mistrustfully
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
That
was
just
what
we
were
afraid
of
,
Sofya
Semyonovna
and
*NL*
I
.
Then
you
still
have
faith
in
life
?
Thank
God
,
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
smiled
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
faith
,
but
I
have
just
been
weeping
in
mother
's
arms
;
I
*NL*
have
n't
faith
,
but
I
have
just
asked
her
to
pray
for
me
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
it
is
,
Dounia
,
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
at
mother
's
?
Have
you
told
her
?
''
cried
Dounia
,
*NL*
horror-stricken
.
``
Surely
you
have
n't
done
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
tell
her
...
in
words
;
but
she
understood
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
She
heard
you
talking
in
your
sleep
.
I
am
sure
she
half
understands
it
*NL*
already
.
Perhaps
I
did
wrong
in
going
to
see
her
.
I
do
n't
know
why
I
did
*NL*
go
.
I
am
a
contemptible
person
,
Dounia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
contemptible
person
,
but
ready
to
face
suffering
!
You
are
,
are
n't
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
going
.
At
once
.
Yes
,
to
escape
the
disgrace
I
thought
of
*NL*
drowning
myself
,
Dounia
,
but
as
I
looked
into
the
water
,
I
thought
that
*NL*
if
I
had
considered
myself
strong
till
now
I
'd
better
not
be
afraid
of
*NL*
disgrace
,
''
he
said
,
hurrying
on
.
``
It
's
pride
,
Dounia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pride
,
Rodya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
gleam
of
fire
in
his
lustreless
eyes
;
he
seemed
to
be
glad
*NL*
to
think
that
he
was
still
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
think
,
sister
,
that
I
was
simply
afraid
of
the
water
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
looking
into
her
face
with
a
sinister
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Rodya
,
hush
!
''
cried
Dounia
bitterly
.
Silence
lasted
for
two
*NL*
minutes
.
He
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
;
Dounia
stood
at
the
*NL*
other
end
of
the
table
and
looked
at
him
with
anguish
.
Suddenly
he
got
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
late
,
it
's
time
to
go
!
I
am
going
at
once
to
give
myself
up
.
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
I
am
going
to
give
myself
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Big
tears
fell
down
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
crying
,
sister
,
but
can
you
hold
out
your
hand
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
doubted
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
her
arms
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
half
expiating
your
crime
by
facing
the
suffering
?
''
she
*NL*
cried
,
holding
him
close
and
kissing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crime
?
What
crime
?
''
he
cried
in
sudden
fury
.
``
That
I
killed
a
vile
*NL*
noxious
insect
,
an
old
pawnbroker
woman
,
of
use
to
no
one
!
...
Killing
*NL*
her
was
atonement
for
forty
sins
.
She
was
sucking
the
life
out
of
poor
*NL*
people
.
Was
that
a
crime
?
I
am
not
thinking
of
it
and
I
am
not
thinking
*NL*
of
expiating
it
,
and
why
are
you
all
rubbing
it
in
on
all
sides
?
'
A
*NL*
crime
!
a
crime
!
'
Only
now
I
see
clearly
the
imbecility
of
my
cowardice
,
*NL*
now
that
I
have
decided
to
face
this
superfluous
disgrace
.
It
's
simply
*NL*
because
I
am
contemptible
and
have
nothing
in
me
that
I
have
decided
to
,
*NL*
perhaps
too
for
my
advantage
,
as
that
...
Porfiry
...
suggested
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
brother
,
what
are
you
saying
?
Why
,
you
have
shed
blood
?
''
cried
*NL*
Dounia
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
all
men
shed
,
''
he
put
in
almost
frantically
,
``
which
flows
and
has
*NL*
always
flowed
in
streams
,
which
is
spilt
like
champagne
,
and
for
which
*NL*
men
are
crowned
in
the
Capitol
and
are
called
afterwards
benefactors
of
*NL*
mankind
.
Look
into
it
more
carefully
and
understand
it
!
I
too
wanted
to
*NL*
do
good
to
men
and
would
have
done
hundreds
,
thousands
of
good
deeds
*NL*
to
make
up
for
that
one
piece
of
stupidity
,
not
stupidity
even
,
simply
*NL*
clumsiness
,
for
the
idea
was
by
no
means
so
stupid
as
it
seems
now
*NL*
that
it
has
failed
...
-LRB-
Everything
seems
stupid
when
it
fails
.
-RRB-
By
that
*NL*
stupidity
I
only
wanted
to
put
myself
into
an
independent
position
,
to
*NL*
take
the
first
step
,
to
obtain
means
,
and
then
everything
would
have
*NL*
been
smoothed
over
by
benefits
immeasurable
in
comparison

But
I.
.
.
*NL*
I
could
n't
carry
out
even
the
first
step
,
because
I
am
contemptible
,
*NL*
that
's
what
's
the
matter
!
And
yet
I
wo
n't
look
at
it
as
you
do
.
If
I
had
*NL*
succeeded
I
should
have
been
crowned
with
glory
,
but
now
I
'm
trapped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
not
so
,
not
so
!
Brother
,
what
are
you
saying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
not
picturesque
,
not
aesthetically
attractive
!
I
fail
to
*NL*
understand
why
bombarding
people
by
regular
siege
is
more
honourable
.
*NL*
The
fear
of
appearances
is
the
first
symptom
of
impotence
.
I
've
never
,
*NL*
never
recognised
this
more
clearly
than
now
,
and
I
am
further
than
ever
*NL*
from
seeing
that
what
I
did
was
a
crime

I
've
never
,
never
been
stronger
*NL*
and
more
convinced
than
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
had
rushed
into
his
pale
exhausted
face
,
but
as
he
uttered
*NL*
his
last
explanation
,
he
happened
to
meet
Dounia
's
eyes
and
he
saw
such
*NL*
anguish
in
them
that
he
could
not
help
being
checked
.
He
felt
that
he
*NL*
had
,
anyway
,
made
these
two
poor
women
miserable
,
that
he
was
,
anyway
,
*NL*
the
cause

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dounia

I
am
guilty

Good-bye

We
wo
n't
dispute

It
's
time
,
high
time
to
go

*NL*
Do
n't
follow
me

I
beseech
you
,
I
have
somewhere
else
to
go
...
But
you
*NL*
go
at
once
and
sit
with
mother
.
I
entreat
you
to
!
It
's
my
last
request
*NL*
of
you

Do
n't
leave
her
at
all
;
I
left
her
in
a
state
of
anxiety

that
*NL*
she
is
not
fit
to
bear
;
she
will
die
or
go
out
of
her

Be
with
*NL*
her

Razumihin
will
be
with

been
talking

'll
try

be
honest

if
I
am
a
*NL*
murderer

Perhaps
I
shall
some
day
make
a
name

I
wo
n't
disgrace
you

*NL*
you
will
see
;
I
'll
still
show
...
Now
good-bye
for
the
present
,
''
he
*NL*
concluded
hurriedly
,
noticing
again
a
strange
expression
in
Dounia
's
*NL*
eyes
at
his
last
words
and
promises
.
``
Why
are
you
crying
?
Do
n't
cry
,
*NL*
do
n't
cry
:
we
are
not
parting
for
ever
!
Ah
,
yes
!
Wait
a
minute
,
I
'd
*NL*
forgotten
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
table
,
took
up
a
thick
dusty
book
,
opened
it
and
took
*NL*
from
between
the
pages
a
little
water-colour
portrait
on
ivory
.
It
was
*NL*
the
portrait
of
his
landlady
's
daughter
,
who
had
died
of
fever
,
that
*NL*
strange
girl
who
had
wanted
to
be
a
nun
.
For
a
minute
he
gazed
at
the
*NL*
delicate
expressive
face
of
his
betrothed
,
kissed
the
portrait
and
gave
*NL*
it
to
Dounia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
talk
a
great
deal
about
it
to
her
,
only
to
her
,
''
he
said
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
``
To
her
heart
I
confided
much
of
what
has
since
been
so
*NL*
hideously
realised
.
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
''
he
returned
to
Dounia
,
``
she
was
*NL*
as
much
opposed
to
it
as
you
,
and
I
am
glad
that
she
is
gone
.
The
great
*NL*
point
is
that
everything
now
is
going
to
be
different
,
is
going
to
*NL*
be
broken
in
two
,
''
he
cried
,
suddenly
returning
to
his
dejection
.
*NL*
``
Everything
,
everything
,
and
am
I
prepared
for
it
?
Do
I
want
it
myself
?
*NL*
They
say
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
suffer
!
What
's
the
object
of
these
*NL*
senseless
sufferings
?
shall
I
know
any
better
what
they
are
for
,
when
I
*NL*
am
crushed
by
hardships
and
idiocy
,
and
weak
as
an
old
man
after
twenty
*NL*
years
'
penal
servitude
?
And
what
shall
I
have
to
live
for
then
?
Why
am
I
*NL*
consenting
to
that
life
now
?
Oh
,
I
knew
I
was
contemptible
when
I
stood
*NL*
looking
at
the
Neva
at
daybreak
to-day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
both
went
out
.
It
was
hard
for
Dounia
,
but
she
loved
him
.
*NL*
She
walked
away
,
but
after
going
fifty
paces
she
turned
round
to
look
*NL*
at
him
again
.
He
was
still
in
sight
.
At
the
corner
he
too
turned
and
for
*NL*
the
last
time
their
eyes
met
;
but
noticing
that
she
was
looking
at
him
,
*NL*
he
motioned
her
away
with
impatience
and
even
vexation
,
and
turned
the
*NL*
corner
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
wicked
,
I
see
that
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
feeling
ashamed
a
*NL*
moment
later
of
his
angry
gesture
to
Dounia
.
``
But
why
are
they
so
fond
*NL*
of
me
if
I
do
n't
deserve
it
?
Oh
,
if
only
I
were
alone
and
no
one
loved
*NL*
me
and
I
too
had
never
loved
anyone
!
_
Nothing
of
all
this
would
have
*NL*
happened
.
_
But
I
wonder
shall
I
in
those
fifteen
or
twenty
years
grow
so
*NL*
meek
that
I
shall
humble
myself
before
people
and
whimper
at
every
word
*NL*
that
I
am
a
criminal
?
Yes
,
that
's
it
,
that
's
it
,
that
's
what
they
are
*NL*
sending
me
there
for
,
that
's
what
they
want
.
Look
at
them
running
to
and
*NL*
fro
about
the
streets
,
every
one
of
them
a
scoundrel
and
a
criminal
at
*NL*
heart
and
,
worse
still
,
an
idiot
.
But
try
to
get
me
off
and
they
'd
be
*NL*
wild
with
righteous
indignation
.
Oh
,
how
I
hate
them
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
to
musing
by
what
process
it
could
come
to
pass
,
that
he
could
*NL*
be
humbled
before
all
of
them
,
indiscriminately
--
humbled
by
conviction
.
*NL*
And
yet
why
not
?
It
must
be
so
.
Would
not
twenty
years
of
continual
*NL*
bondage
crush
him
utterly
?
Water
wears
out
a
stone
.
And
why
,
why
should
*NL*
he
live
after
that
?
Why
should
he
go
now
when
he
knew
that
it
would
be
*NL*
so
?
It
was
the
hundredth
time
perhaps
that
he
had
asked
himself
that
*NL*
question
since
the
previous
evening
,
but
still
he
went
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
into
Sonia
's
room
,
it
was
already
getting
dark
.
All
day
*NL*
Sonia
had
been
waiting
for
him
in
terrible
anxiety
.
Dounia
had
been
*NL*
waiting
with
her
.
She
had
come
to
her
that
morning
,
remembering
*NL*
Svidrigailov
's
words
that
Sonia
knew
.
We
will
not
describe
the
*NL*
conversation
and
tears
of
the
two
girls
,
and
how
friendly
they
became
.
*NL*
Dounia
gained
one
comfort
at
least
from
that
interview
,
that
her
*NL*
brother
would
not
be
alone
.
He
had
gone
to
her
,
Sonia
,
first
with
his
*NL*
confession
;
he
had
gone
to
her
for
human
fellowship
when
he
needed
it
;
*NL*
she
would
go
with
him
wherever
fate
might
send
him
.
Dounia
did
not
ask
,
*NL*
but
she
knew
it
was
so
.
She
looked
at
Sonia
almost
with
reverence
and
*NL*
at
first
almost
embarrassed
her
by
it
.
Sonia
was
almost
on
the
point
*NL*
of
tears
.
She
felt
herself
,
on
the
contrary
,
hardly
worthy
to
look
at
*NL*
Dounia
.
Dounia
's
gracious
image
when
she
had
bowed
to
her
so
attentively
*NL*
and
respectfully
at
their
first
meeting
in
Raskolnikov
's
room
had
*NL*
remained
in
her
mind
as
one
of
the
fairest
visions
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dounia
at
last
became
impatient
and
,
leaving
Sonia
,
went
to
her
*NL*
brother
's
room
to
await
him
there
;
she
kept
thinking
that
he
would
come
*NL*
there
first
.
When
she
had
gone
,
Sonia
began
to
be
tortured
by
the
dread
*NL*
of
his
committing
suicide
,
and
Dounia
too
feared
it
.
But
they
had
spent
*NL*
the
day
trying
to
persuade
each
other
that
that
could
not
be
,
and
both
*NL*
were
less
anxious
while
they
were
together
.
As
soon
as
they
parted
,
each
*NL*
thought
of
nothing
else
.
Sonia
remembered
how
Svidrigailov
had
said
to
*NL*
her
the
day
before
that
Raskolnikov
had
two
alternatives
--
Siberia
or
...
*NL*
Besides
she
knew
his
vanity
,
his
pride
and
his
lack
of
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
he
has
nothing
but
cowardice
and
fear
of
death
to
*NL*
make
him
live
?
''
she
thought
at
last
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
sun
was
setting
.
Sonia
was
standing
in
dejection
,
looking
*NL*
intently
out
of
the
window
,
but
from
it
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
*NL*
unwhitewashed
blank
wall
of
the
next
house
.
At
last
when
she
began
to
*NL*
feel
sure
of
his
death
--
he
walked
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
cry
of
joy
,
but
looking
carefully
into
his
face
she
turned
*NL*
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Raskolnikov
,
smiling
.
``
I
have
come
for
your
cross
,
Sonia
.
It
*NL*
was
you
told
me
to
go
to
the
cross-roads
;
why
is
it
you
are
frightened
*NL*
now
it
's
come
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
gazed
at
him
astonished
.
His
tone
seemed
strange
to
her
;
a
cold
*NL*
shiver
ran
over
her
,
but
in
a
moment
she
guessed
that
the
tone
and
the
*NL*
words
were
a
mask
.
He
spoke
to
her
looking
away
,
as
though
to
avoid
*NL*
meeting
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Sonia
,
I
've
decided
that
it
will
be
better
so
.
There
is
one
*NL*
fact
...
But
it
's
a
long
story
and
there
's
no
need
to
discuss
it
.
But
*NL*
do
you
know
what
angers
me
?
It
annoys
me
that
all
those
stupid
brutish
*NL*
faces
will
be
gaping
at
me
directly
,
pestering
me
with
their
stupid
*NL*
questions
,
which
I
shall
have
to
answer
--
they
'll
point
their
fingers
at
*NL*
me
...
Tfoo
!
You
know
I
am
not
going
to
Porfiry
,
I
am
sick
of
him
.
I
'd
*NL*
rather
go
to
my
friend
,
the
Explosive
Lieutenant
;
how
I
shall
surprise
*NL*
him
,
what
a
sensation
I
shall
make
!
But
I
must
be
cooler
;
I
've
become
*NL*
too
irritable
of
late
.
You
know
I
was
nearly
shaking
my
fist
at
my
*NL*
sister
just
now
,
because
she
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
me
.
It
's
*NL*
a
brutal
state
to
be
in
!
Ah
!
what
am
I
coming
to
!
Well
,
where
are
the
*NL*
crosses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
he
was
doing
.
He
could
not
stay
still
or
*NL*
concentrate
his
attention
on
anything
;
his
ideas
seemed
to
gallop
after
*NL*
one
another
,
he
talked
incoherently
,
his
hands
trembled
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
a
word
Sonia
took
out
of
the
drawer
two
crosses
,
one
of
cypress
*NL*
wood
and
one
of
copper
.
She
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
herself
and
*NL*
over
him
,
and
put
the
wooden
cross
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
symbol
of
my
taking
up
the
cross
,
''
he
laughed
.
``
As
though
I
*NL*
had
not
suffered
much
till
now
!
The
wooden
cross
,
that
is
the
peasant
*NL*
one
;
the
copper
one
,
that
is
Lizaveta
's
--
you
will
wear
yourself
,
show
*NL*
me
!
So
she
had
it
on
...
at
that
moment
?
I
remember
two
things
like
*NL*
these
too
,
a
silver
one
and
a
little
ikon
.
I
threw
them
back
on
the
old
*NL*
woman
's
neck
.
Those
would
be
appropriate
now
,
really
,
those
are
what
I
*NL*
ought
to
put
on
now
...
But
I
am
talking
nonsense
and
forgetting
what
*NL*
matters
;
I
'm
somehow
forgetful
...
You
see
I
have
come
to
warn
you
,
*NL*
Sonia
,
so
that
you
might
know
...
that
's
all
--
that
's
all
I
came
for
.
But
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
more
to
say
.
You
wanted
me
to
go
yourself
.
Well
,
now
I
*NL*
am
going
to
prison
and
you
'll
have
your
wish
.
Well
,
what
are
you
crying
*NL*
for
?
You
too
?
Do
n't
.
Leave
off
!
Oh
,
how
I
hate
it
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
feeling
was
stirred
;
his
heart
ached
,
as
he
looked
at
her
.
``
Why
*NL*
is
she
grieving
too
?
''
he
thought
to
himself
.
``
What
am
I
to
her
?
Why
does
*NL*
she
weep
?
Why
is
she
looking
after
me
,
like
my
mother
or
Dounia
?
She
'll
*NL*
be
my
nurse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
yourself
,
say
at
least
one
prayer
,
''
Sonia
begged
in
a
timid
*NL*
broken
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
certainly
,
as
much
as
you
like
!
And
sincerely
,
Sonia
,
sincerely
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
wanted
to
say
something
quite
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
himself
several
times
.
Sonia
took
up
her
shawl
and
put
*NL*
it
over
her
head
.
It
was
the
green
_
drap
de
dames
_
shawl
of
which
*NL*
Marmeladov
had
spoken
,
``
the
family
shawl
.
''
Raskolnikov
thought
of
that
*NL*
looking
at
it
,
but
he
did
not
ask
.
He
began
to
feel
himself
that
he
*NL*
was
certainly
forgetting
things
and
was
disgustingly
agitated
.
He
was
*NL*
frightened
at
this
.
He
was
suddenly
struck
too
by
the
thought
that
Sonia
*NL*
meant
to
go
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
Where
are
you
going
?
Stay
here
,
stay
!
I
'll
go
*NL*
alone
,
''
he
cried
in
cowardly
vexation
,
and
almost
resentful
,
he
moved
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
``
What
's
the
use
of
going
in
procession
?
''
he
muttered
*NL*
going
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
remained
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
He
had
not
even
said
*NL*
good-bye
to
her
;
he
had
forgotten
her
.
A
poignant
and
rebellious
doubt
*NL*
surged
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
right
,
was
it
right
,
all
this
?
''
he
thought
again
as
he
went
down
*NL*
the
stairs
.
``
Could
n't
he
stop
and
retract
it
all
...
and
not
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
still
he
went
.
He
felt
suddenly
once
for
all
that
he
must
n't
ask
*NL*
himself
questions
.
As
he
turned
into
the
street
he
remembered
that
he
*NL*
had
not
said
good-bye
to
Sonia
,
that
he
had
left
her
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
room
in
her
green
shawl
,
not
daring
to
stir
after
he
had
shouted
*NL*
at
her
,
and
he
stopped
short
for
a
moment
.
At
the
same
instant
,
another
*NL*
thought
dawned
upon
him
,
as
though
it
had
been
lying
in
wait
to
strike
*NL*
him
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
with
what
object
did
I
go
to
her
just
now
?
I
told
her
--
on
*NL*
business
;
on
what
business
?
I
had
no
sort
of
business
!
To
tell
her
I
was
*NL*
_
going
_
;
but
where
was
the
need
?
Do
I
love
her
?
No
,
no
,
I
drove
her
away
*NL*
just
now
like
a
dog
.
Did
I
want
her
crosses
?
Oh
,
how
low
I
've
sunk
!
No
,
*NL*
I
wanted
her
tears
,
I
wanted
to
see
her
terror
,
to
see
how
her
heart
*NL*
ached
!
I
had
to
have
something
to
cling
to
,
something
to
delay
me
,
some
*NL*
friendly
face
to
see
!
And
I
dared
to
believe
in
myself
,
to
dream
of
what
*NL*
I
would
do
!
I
am
a
beggarly
contemptible
wretch
,
contemptible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
the
canal
bank
,
and
he
had
not
much
further
to
go
.
But
*NL*
on
reaching
the
bridge
he
stopped
and
turning
out
of
his
way
along
it
*NL*
went
to
the
Hay
Market
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
eagerly
to
right
and
left
,
gazed
intently
at
every
object
and
*NL*
could
not
fix
his
attention
on
anything
;
everything
slipped
away
.
``
In
*NL*
another
week
,
another
month
I
shall
be
driven
in
a
prison
van
over
this
*NL*
bridge
,
how
shall
I
look
at
the
canal
then
?
I
should
like
to
remember
*NL*
this
!
''
slipped
into
his
mind
.
``
Look
at
this
sign
!
How
shall
I
read
those
*NL*
letters
then
?
It
's
written
here
`
Campany
,
'
that
's
a
thing
to
remember
,
*NL*
that
letter
_
a
_
,
and
to
look
at
it
again
in
a
month
--
how
shall
I
look
*NL*
at
it
then
?
What
shall
I
be
feeling
and
thinking
then
?
...
How
trivial
*NL*
it
all
must
be
,
what
I
am
fretting
about
now
!
Of
course
it
must
all
be
*NL*
interesting
...
in
its
way
...
-LRB-
Ha-ha-ha
!
What
am
I
thinking
about
?
-RRB-
I
am
*NL*
becoming
a
baby
,
I
am
showing
off
to
myself
;
why
am
I
ashamed
?
Foo
!
how
*NL*
people
shove
!
that
fat
man
--
a
German
he
must
be
--
who
pushed
against
*NL*
me
,
does
he
know
whom
he
pushed
?
There
's
a
peasant
woman
with
a
baby
,
*NL*
begging
.
It
's
curious
that
she
thinks
me
happier
than
she
is
.
I
might
*NL*
give
her
something
,
for
the
incongruity
of
it
.
Here
's
a
five
copeck
*NL*
piece
left
in
my
pocket
,
where
did
I
get
it
?
Here
,
here
...
take
it
,
my
*NL*
good
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
''
the
beggar
chanted
in
a
lachrymose
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
into
the
Hay
Market
.
It
was
distasteful
,
very
distasteful
to
be
*NL*
in
a
crowd
,
but
he
walked
just
where
he
saw
most
people
.
He
would
have
*NL*
given
anything
in
the
world
to
be
alone
;
but
he
knew
himself
that
he
*NL*
would
not
have
remained
alone
for
a
moment
.
There
was
a
man
drunk
and
*NL*
disorderly
in
the
crowd
;
he
kept
trying
to
dance
and
falling
down
.
There
*NL*
was
a
ring
round
him
.
Raskolnikov
squeezed
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
*NL*
stared
for
some
minutes
at
the
drunken
man
and
suddenly
gave
a
short
*NL*
jerky
laugh
.
A
minute
later
he
had
forgotten
him
and
did
not
see
him
,
*NL*
though
he
still
stared
.
He
moved
away
at
last
,
not
remembering
where
he
*NL*
was
;
but
when
he
got
into
the
middle
of
the
square
an
emotion
suddenly
*NL*
came
over
him
,
overwhelming
him
body
and
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
recalled
Sonia
's
words
,
``
Go
to
the
cross-roads
,
bow
down
to
*NL*
the
people
,
kiss
the
earth
,
for
you
have
sinned
against
it
too
,
and
say
*NL*
aloud
to
the
whole
world
,
'
I
am
a
murderer
.
'
''
He
trembled
,
remembering
*NL*
that
.
And
the
hopeless
misery
and
anxiety
of
all
that
time
,
especially
*NL*
of
the
last
hours
,
had
weighed
so
heavily
upon
him
that
he
positively
*NL*
clutched
at
the
chance
of
this
new
unmixed
,
complete
sensation
.
It
came
*NL*
over
him
like
a
fit
;
it
was
like
a
single
spark
kindled
in
his
soul
and
*NL*
spreading
fire
through
him
.
Everything
in
him
softened
at
once
and
the
*NL*
tears
started
into
his
eyes
.
He
fell
to
the
earth
on
the
spot
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
down
in
the
middle
of
the
square
,
bowed
down
to
the
earth
,
and
*NL*
kissed
that
filthy
earth
with
bliss
and
rapture
.
He
got
up
and
bowed
*NL*
down
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
boozed
,
''
a
youth
near
him
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
roar
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
going
to
Jerusalem
,
brothers
,
and
saying
good-bye
to
his
children
*NL*
and
his
country
.
He
's
bowing
down
to
all
the
world
and
kissing
the
great
*NL*
city
of
St.
Petersburg
and
its
pavement
,
''
added
a
workman
who
was
a
*NL*
little
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
a
young
man
,
too
!
''
observed
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
gentleman
,
''
someone
observed
soberly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
knowing
who
's
a
gentleman
and
who
is
n't
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
exclamations
and
remarks
checked
Raskolnikov
,
and
the
words
,
``
I
am
*NL*
a
murderer
,
''
which
were
perhaps
on
the
point
of
dropping
from
his
lips
,
*NL*
died
away
.
He
bore
these
remarks
quietly
,
however
,
and
,
without
looking
*NL*
round
,
he
turned
down
a
street
leading
to
the
police
office
.
He
had
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
something
on
the
way
which
did
not
surprise
him
;
he
had
felt
*NL*
that
it
must
be
so
.
The
second
time
he
bowed
down
in
the
Hay
Market
he
*NL*
saw
,
standing
fifty
paces
from
him
on
the
left
,
Sonia
.
She
was
hiding
*NL*
from
him
behind
one
of
the
wooden
shanties
in
the
market-place
.
She
had
*NL*
followed
him
then
on
his
painful
way
!
Raskolnikov
at
that
moment
felt
*NL*
and
knew
once
for
all
that
Sonia
was
with
him
for
ever
and
would
follow
*NL*
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
wherever
fate
might
take
him
.
It
wrung
his
*NL*
heart
...
but
he
was
just
reaching
the
fatal
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
into
the
yard
fairly
resolutely
.
He
had
to
mount
to
the
third
*NL*
storey
.
``
I
shall
be
some
time
going
up
,
''
he
thought
.
He
felt
as
though
*NL*
the
fateful
moment
was
still
far
off
,
as
though
he
had
plenty
of
time
*NL*
left
for
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
same
rubbish
,
the
same
eggshells
lying
about
on
the
spiral
*NL*
stairs
,
again
the
open
doors
of
the
flats
,
again
the
same
kitchens
and
*NL*
the
same
fumes
and
stench
coming
from
them
.
Raskolnikov
had
not
been
*NL*
here
since
that
day
.
His
legs
were
numb
and
gave
way
under
him
,
but
*NL*
still
they
moved
forward
.
He
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
,
to
*NL*
collect
himself
,
so
as
to
enter
_
like
a
man
_
.
``
But
why
?
what
for
?
''
he
*NL*
wondered
,
reflecting
.
``
If
I
must
drink
the
cup
what
difference
does
it
*NL*
make
?
The
more
revolting
the
better
.
''
He
imagined
for
an
instant
the
*NL*
figure
of
the
``
explosive
lieutenant
,
''
Ilya
Petrovitch
.
Was
he
actually
*NL*
going
to
him
?
Could
n't
he
go
to
someone
else
?
To
Nikodim
Fomitch
?
*NL*
Could
n't
he
turn
back
and
go
straight
to
Nikodim
Fomitch
's
lodgings
?
*NL*
At
least
then
it
would
be
done
privately
...
No
,
no
!
To
the
``
explosive
*NL*
lieutenant
''
!
If
he
must
drink
it
,
drink
it
off
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
cold
and
hardly
conscious
,
he
opened
the
door
of
the
office
.
*NL*
There
were
very
few
people
in
it
this
time
--
only
a
house
porter
and
a
*NL*
peasant
.
The
doorkeeper
did
not
even
peep
out
from
behind
his
screen
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
walked
into
the
next
room
.
``
Perhaps
I
still
need
not
speak
,
''
*NL*
passed
through
his
mind
.
Some
sort
of
clerk
not
wearing
a
uniform
was
*NL*
settling
himself
at
a
bureau
to
write
.
In
a
corner
another
clerk
was
*NL*
seating
himself
.
Zametov
was
not
there
,
nor
,
of
course
,
Nikodim
Fomitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
in
?
''
Raskolnikov
asked
,
addressing
the
person
at
the
bureau
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ah
!
Not
a
sound
was
heard
,
not
a
sight
was
seen
,
but
I
scent
the
*NL*
Russian

how
does
it
go
on
in
the
fairy
tale

'
''
a
familiar
voice
cried
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
shuddered
.
The
Explosive
Lieutenant
stood
before
him
.
He
*NL*
had
just
come
in
from
the
third
room
.
``
It
is
the
hand
of
fate
,
''
thought
*NL*
Raskolnikov
.
``
Why
is
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
come
to
see
us
?
What
about
?
''
cried
Ilya
Petrovitch
.
He
*NL*
was
obviously
in
an
exceedingly
good
humour
and
perhaps
a
trifle
*NL*
exhilarated
.
``
If
it
's

are

early

only
a

Dostoevsky
appears
to
have
forgotten
that
it
is
after
*NL*
sunset
,
and
that
the
last
time
Raskolnikov
visited
the
*NL*
police

at
two
in
the
afternoon
he
was
reproached
for
*NL*
coming

and
did
not
know
*NL*
what
he
was
doing
.
He
began
going
down
the
stairs
,
supporting
himself
*NL*
with
his
right
hand
against
the
wall
.
He
fancied
that
a
porter
pushed
*NL*
past
him
on
his
way
upstairs
to
the
police
office
,
that
a
dog
in
*NL*
the
lower
storey
kept
up
a
shrill
barking
and
that
a
woman
flung
a
*NL*
rolling-pin
at
it
and
shouted
.
He
went
down
and
out
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
There
,
not
far
from
the
entrance
,
stood
Sonia
,
pale
and
horror-stricken
.
*NL*
She
looked
wildly
at
him
.
He
stood
still
before
her
.
There
was
a
look
of
*NL*
poignant
agony
,
of
despair
,
in
her
face
.
She
clasped
her
hands
.
His
lips
*NL*
worked
in
an
ugly
,
meaningless
smile
.
He
stood
still
a
minute
,
grinned
*NL*
and
went
back
to
the
police
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ilya
Petrovitch
had
sat
down
and
was
rummaging
among
some
papers
.
Before
*NL*
him
stood
the
same
peasant
who
had
pushed
by
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hulloa
!
Back
again
!
have
you
left
something
behind
?
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
,
with
white
lips
and
staring
eyes
,
came
slowly
nearer
.
*NL*
He
walked
right
to
the
table
,
leaned
his
hand
on
it
,
tried
to
say
*NL*
something
,
but
could
not
;
only
incoherent
sounds
were
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
feeling
ill
,
a
chair
!
Here
,
sit
down
!
Some
water
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
dropped
on
to
a
chair
,
but
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
*NL*
face
of
Ilya
Petrovitch
,
which
expressed
unpleasant
surprise
.
Both
*NL*
looked
at
one
another
for
a
minute
and
waited
.
Water
was
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
I.
.
.
''
began
Raskolnikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
some
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
refused
the
water
with
his
hand
,
and
softly
and
brokenly
,
*NL*
but
distinctly
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
It
was
I
killed
the
old
pawnbroker
woman
and
her
sister
Lizaveta
with
*NL*
an
axe
and
robbed
them
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ilya
Petrovitch
opened
his
mouth
.
People
ran
up
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
repeated
his
statement
.

*NL*
EPILOGUE
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
Siberia
.
On
the
banks
of
a
broad
solitary
river
stands
a
town
,
one
of
*NL*
the
administrative
centres
of
Russia
;
in
the
town
there
is
a
fortress
,
*NL*
in
the
fortress
there
is
a
prison
.
In
the
prison
the
second-class
*NL*
convict
Rodion
Raskolnikov
has
been
confined
for
nine
months
.
Almost
a
*NL*
year
and
a
half
has
passed
since
his
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
little
difficulty
about
his
trial
.
The
criminal
adhered
*NL*
exactly
,
firmly
,
and
clearly
to
his
statement
.
He
did
not
confuse
nor
*NL*
misrepresent
the
facts
,
nor
soften
them
in
his
own
interest
,
nor
omit
*NL*
the
smallest
detail
.
He
explained
every
incident
of
the
murder
,
the
*NL*
secret
of
_
the
pledge
_
-LRB-
the
piece
of
wood
with
a
strip
of
metal
-RRB-
which
*NL*
was
found
in
the
murdered
woman
's
hand
.
He
described
minutely
how
he
*NL*
had
taken
her
keys
,
what
they
were
like
,
as
well
as
the
chest
and
its
*NL*
contents
;
he
explained
the
mystery
of
Lizaveta
's
murder
;
described
how
*NL*
Koch
and
,
after
him
,
the
student
knocked
,
and
repeated
all
they
had
said
*NL*
to
one
another
;
how
he
afterwards
had
run
downstairs
and
heard
Nikolay
*NL*
and
Dmitri
shouting
;
how
he
had
hidden
in
the
empty
flat
and
afterwards
*NL*
gone
home
.
He
ended
by
indicating
the
stone
in
the
yard
off
the
*NL*
Voznesensky
Prospect
under
which
the
purse
and
the
trinkets
were
found
.
*NL*
The
whole
thing
,
in
fact
,
was
perfectly
clear
.
The
lawyers
and
the
*NL*
judges
were
very
much
struck
,
among
other
things
,
by
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
had
hidden
the
trinkets
and
the
purse
under
a
stone
,
without
making
*NL*
use
of
them
,
and
that
,
what
was
more
,
he
did
not
now
remember
what
the
*NL*
trinkets
were
like
,
or
even
how
many
there
were
.
The
fact
that
he
had
*NL*
never
opened
the
purse
and
did
not
even
know
how
much
was
in
it
seemed
*NL*
incredible
.
There
turned
out
to
be
in
the
purse
three
hundred
and
*NL*
seventeen
roubles
and
sixty
copecks
.
From
being
so
long
under
the
stone
,
*NL*
some
of
the
most
valuable
notes
lying
uppermost
had
suffered
from
the
*NL*
damp
.
They
were
a
long
while
trying
to
discover
why
the
accused
man
*NL*
should
tell
a
lie
about
this
,
when
about
everything
else
he
had
made
*NL*
a
truthful
and
straightforward
confession
.
Finally
some
of
the
lawyers
*NL*
more
versed
in
psychology
admitted
that
it
was
possible
he
had
really
*NL*
not
looked
into
the
purse
,
and
so
did
n't
know
what
was
in
it
when
he
*NL*
hid
it
under
the
stone
.
But
they
immediately
drew
the
deduction
that
*NL*
the
crime
could
only
have
been
committed
through
temporary
mental
*NL*
derangement
,
through
homicidal
mania
,
without
object
or
the
pursuit
of
*NL*
gain
.
This
fell
in
with
the
most
recent
fashionable
theory
of
temporary
*NL*
insanity
,
so
often
applied
in
our
days
in
criminal
cases
.
Moreover
*NL*
Raskolnikov
's
hypochondriacal
condition
was
proved
by
many
witnesses
,
by
*NL*
Dr.
Zossimov
,
his
former
fellow
students
,
his
landlady
and
her
servant
.
*NL*
All
this
pointed
strongly
to
the
conclusion
that
Raskolnikov
was
not
*NL*
quite
like
an
ordinary
murderer
and
robber
,
but
that
there
was
another
*NL*
element
in
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
intense
annoyance
of
those
who
maintained
this
opinion
,
the
*NL*
criminal
scarcely
attempted
to
defend
himself
.
To
the
decisive
question
*NL*
as
to
what
motive
impelled
him
to
the
murder
and
the
robbery
,
he
*NL*
answered
very
clearly
with
the
coarsest
frankness
that
the
cause
was
*NL*
his
miserable
position
,
his
poverty
and
helplessness
,
and
his
desire
to
*NL*
provide
for
his
first
steps
in
life
by
the
help
of
the
three
thousand
*NL*
roubles
he
had
reckoned
on
finding
.
He
had
been
led
to
the
murder
*NL*
through
his
shallow
and
cowardly
nature
,
exasperated
moreover
by
*NL*
privation
and
failure
.
To
the
question
what
led
him
to
confess
,
he
*NL*
answered
that
it
was
his
heartfelt
repentance
.
All
this
was
almost
*NL*
coarse
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
sentence
however
was
more
merciful
than
could
have
been
expected
,
*NL*
perhaps
partly
because
the
criminal
had
not
tried
to
justify
himself
,
*NL*
but
had
rather
shown
a
desire
to
exaggerate
his
guilt
.
All
the
strange
*NL*
and
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
crime
were
taken
into
consideration
.
*NL*
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
abnormal
and
poverty-stricken
condition
*NL*
of
the
criminal
at
the
time
.
The
fact
that
he
had
made
no
use
of
what
he
*NL*
had
stolen
was
put
down
partly
to
the
effect
of
remorse
,
partly
to
his
*NL*
abnormal
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
crime
.
Incidentally
the
*NL*
murder
of
Lizaveta
served
indeed
to
confirm
the
last
hypothesis
:
a
man
*NL*
commits
two
murders
and
forgets
that
the
door
is
open
!
Finally
,
the
*NL*
confession
,
at
the
very
moment
when
the
case
was
hopelessly
muddled
by
*NL*
the
false
evidence
given
by
Nikolay
through
melancholy
and
fanaticism
,
*NL*
and
when
,
moreover
,
there
were
no
proofs
against
the
real
criminal
,
no
*NL*
suspicions
even
-LRB-
Porfiry
Petrovitch
fully
kept
his
word
-RRB-
--
all
this
did
*NL*
much
to
soften
the
sentence
.
Other
circumstances
,
too
,
in
the
prisoner
's
*NL*
favour
came
out
quite
unexpectedly
.
Razumihin
somehow
discovered
and
*NL*
proved
that
while
Raskolnikov
was
at
the
university
he
had
helped
a
poor
*NL*
consumptive
fellow
student
and
had
spent
his
last
penny
on
supporting
*NL*
him
for
six
months
,
and
when
this
student
died
,
leaving
a
decrepit
*NL*
old
father
whom
he
had
maintained
almost
from
his
thirteenth
year
,
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
got
the
old
man
into
a
hospital
and
paid
for
his
funeral
*NL*
when
he
died
.
Raskolnikov
's
landlady
bore
witness
,
too
,
that
when
they
*NL*
had
lived
in
another
house
at
Five
Corners
,
Raskolnikov
had
rescued
two
*NL*
little
children
from
a
house
on
fire
and
was
burnt
in
doing
so
.
This
was
*NL*
investigated
and
fairly
well
confirmed
by
many
witnesses
.
These
facts
*NL*
made
an
impression
in
his
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
end
the
criminal
was
,
in
consideration
of
extenuating
*NL*
circumstances
,
condemned
to
penal
servitude
in
the
second
class
for
a
*NL*
term
of
eight
years
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial
Raskolnikov
's
mother
fell
ill
.
Dounia
*NL*
and
Razumihin
found
it
possible
to
get
her
out
of
Petersburg
during
the
*NL*
trial
.
Razumihin
chose
a
town
on
the
railway
not
far
from
Petersburg
,
so
*NL*
as
to
be
able
to
follow
every
step
of
the
trial
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
to
see
Avdotya
Romanovna
as
often
as
possible
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
's
*NL*
illness
was
a
strange
nervous
one
and
was
accompanied
by
a
partial
*NL*
derangement
of
her
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dounia
returned
from
her
last
interview
with
her
brother
,
she
*NL*
had
found
her
mother
already
ill
,
in
feverish
delirium
.
That
evening
*NL*
Razumihin
and
she
agreed
what
answers
they
must
make
to
her
mother
's
*NL*
questions
about
Raskolnikov
and
made
up
a
complete
story
for
her
*NL*
mother
's
benefit
of
his
having
to
go
away
to
a
distant
part
of
Russia
*NL*
on
a
business
commission
,
which
would
bring
him
in
the
end
money
and
*NL*
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
struck
by
the
fact
that
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
never
*NL*
asked
them
anything
on
the
subject
,
neither
then
nor
thereafter
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
she
had
her
own
version
of
her
son
's
sudden
departure
;
she
*NL*
told
them
with
tears
how
he
had
come
to
say
good-bye
to
her
,
hinting
*NL*
that
she
alone
knew
many
mysterious
and
important
facts
,
and
that
Rodya
*NL*
had
many
very
powerful
enemies
,
so
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
*NL*
in
hiding
.
As
for
his
future
career
,
she
had
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
*NL*
brilliant
when
certain
sinister
influences
could
be
removed
.
She
assured
*NL*
Razumihin
that
her
son
would
be
one
day
a
great
statesman
,
that
his
*NL*
article
and
brilliant
literary
talent
proved
it
.
This
article
she
was
*NL*
continually
reading
,
she
even
read
it
aloud
,
almost
took
it
to
bed
*NL*
with
her
,
but
scarcely
asked
where
Rodya
was
,
though
the
subject
was
*NL*
obviously
avoided
by
the
others
,
which
might
have
been
enough
to
awaken
*NL*
her
suspicions
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
be
frightened
at
last
at
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
's
strange
*NL*
silence
on
certain
subjects
.
She
did
not
,
for
instance
,
complain
of
*NL*
getting
no
letters
from
him
,
though
in
previous
years
she
had
only
lived
*NL*
on
the
hope
of
letters
from
her
beloved
Rodya
.
This
was
the
cause
of
*NL*
great
uneasiness
to
Dounia
;
the
idea
occurred
to
her
that
her
mother
*NL*
suspected
that
there
was
something
terrible
in
her
son
's
fate
and
was
*NL*
afraid
to
ask
,
for
fear
of
hearing
something
still
more
awful
.
In
any
*NL*
case
,
Dounia
saw
clearly
that
her
mother
was
not
in
full
possession
of
*NL*
her
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
once
or
twice
,
however
,
that
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
gave
*NL*
such
a
turn
to
the
conversation
that
it
was
impossible
to
answer
her
*NL*
without
mentioning
where
Rodya
was
,
and
on
receiving
unsatisfactory
and
*NL*
suspicious
answers
she
became
at
once
gloomy
and
silent
,
and
this
mood
*NL*
lasted
for
a
long
time
.
Dounia
saw
at
last
that
it
was
hard
to
deceive
*NL*
her
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
better
to
be
absolutely
*NL*
silent
on
certain
points
;
but
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
*NL*
the
poor
mother
suspected
something
terrible
.
Dounia
remembered
her
*NL*
brother
's
telling
her
that
her
mother
had
overheard
her
talking
in
her
*NL*
sleep
on
the
night
after
her
interview
with
Svidrigailov
and
before
the
*NL*
fatal
day
of
the
confession
:
had
not
she
made
out
something
from
that
?
*NL*
Sometimes
days
and
even
weeks
of
gloomy
silence
and
tears
would
be
*NL*
succeeded
by
a
period
of
hysterical
animation
,
and
the
invalid
would
*NL*
begin
to
talk
almost
incessantly
of
her
son
,
of
her
hopes
of
his
*NL*
future
...
Her
fancies
were
sometimes
very
strange
.
They
humoured
her
,
*NL*
pretended
to
agree
with
her
-LRB-
she
saw
perhaps
that
they
were
pretending
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
she
still
went
on
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
months
after
Raskolnikov
's
confession
,
he
was
sentenced
.
Razumihin
*NL*
and
Sonia
saw
him
in
prison
as
often
as
it
was
possible
.
At
last
*NL*
the
moment
of
separation
came
.
Dounia
swore
to
her
brother
that
the
*NL*
separation
should
not
be
for
ever
,
Razumihin
did
the
same
.
Razumihin
,
in
*NL*
his
youthful
ardour
,
had
firmly
resolved
to
lay
the
foundations
at
least
*NL*
of
a
secure
livelihood
during
the
next
three
or
four
years
,
and
saving
*NL*
up
a
certain
sum
,
to
emigrate
to
Siberia
,
a
country
rich
in
every
*NL*
natural
resource
and
in
need
of
workers
,
active
men
and
capital
.
There
*NL*
they
would
settle
in
the
town
where
Rodya
was
and
all
together
would
*NL*
begin
a
new
life
.
They
all
wept
at
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
been
very
dreamy
for
a
few
days
before
.
He
asked
a
great
*NL*
deal
about
his
mother
and
was
constantly
anxious
about
her
.
He
worried
*NL*
so
much
about
her
that
it
alarmed
Dounia
.
When
he
heard
about
his
*NL*
mother
's
illness
he
became
very
gloomy
.
With
Sonia
he
was
particularly
*NL*
reserved
all
the
time
.
With
the
help
of
the
money
left
to
her
by
*NL*
Svidrigailov
,
Sonia
had
long
ago
made
her
preparations
to
follow
the
*NL*
party
of
convicts
in
which
he
was
despatched
to
Siberia
.
Not
a
word
*NL*
passed
between
Raskolnikov
and
her
on
the
subject
,
but
both
knew
it
*NL*
would
be
so
.
At
the
final
leave-taking
he
smiled
strangely
at
his
*NL*
sister
's
and
Razumihin
's
fervent
anticipations
of
their
happy
future
*NL*
together
when
he
should
come
out
of
prison
.
He
predicted
that
their
*NL*
mother
's
illness
would
soon
have
a
fatal
ending
.
Sonia
and
he
at
last
*NL*
set
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
later
Dounia
was
married
to
Razumihin
.
It
was
a
quiet
and
*NL*
sorrowful
wedding
;
Porfiry
Petrovitch
and
Zossimov
were
invited
however
.
*NL*
During
all
this
period
Razumihin
wore
an
air
of
resolute
determination
.
*NL*
Dounia
put
implicit
faith
in
his
carrying
out
his
plans
and
indeed
she
*NL*
could
not
but
believe
in
him
.
He
displayed
a
rare
strength
of
will
.
*NL*
Among
other
things
he
began
attending
university
lectures
again
in
order
*NL*
to
take
his
degree
.
They
were
continually
making
plans
for
the
future
;
*NL*
both
counted
on
settling
in
Siberia
within
five
years
at
least
.
Till
*NL*
then
they
rested
their
hopes
on
Sonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
delighted
to
give
her
blessing
to
Dounia
's
*NL*
marriage
with
Razumihin
;
but
after
the
marriage
she
became
even
more
*NL*
melancholy
and
anxious
.
To
give
her
pleasure
Razumihin
told
her
how
*NL*
Raskolnikov
had
looked
after
the
poor
student
and
his
decrepit
father
*NL*
and
how
a
year
ago
he
had
been
burnt
and
injured
in
rescuing
two
*NL*
little
children
from
a
fire
.
These
two
pieces
of
news
excited
Pulcheria
*NL*
Alexandrovna
's
disordered
imagination
almost
to
ecstasy
.
She
was
*NL*
continually
talking
about
them
,
even
entering
into
conversation
with
*NL*
strangers
in
the
street
,
though
Dounia
always
accompanied
her
.
In
public
*NL*
conveyances
and
shops
,
wherever
she
could
capture
a
listener
,
she
would
*NL*
begin
the
discourse
about
her
son
,
his
article
,
how
he
had
helped
the
*NL*
student
,
how
he
had
been
burnt
at
the
fire
,
and
so
on
!
Dounia
did
*NL*
not
know
how
to
restrain
her
.
Apart
from
the
danger
of
her
morbid
*NL*
excitement
,
there
was
the
risk
of
someone
's
recalling
Raskolnikov
's
name
*NL*
and
speaking
of
the
recent
trial
.
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
found
out
the
*NL*
address
of
the
mother
of
the
two
children
her
son
had
saved
and
insisted
*NL*
on
going
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
her
restlessness
reached
an
extreme
point
.
She
would
sometimes
*NL*
begin
to
cry
suddenly
and
was
often
ill
and
feverishly
delirious
.
One
*NL*
morning
she
declared
that
by
her
reckoning
Rodya
ought
soon
to
be
home
,
*NL*
that
she
remembered
when
he
said
good-bye
to
her
he
said
that
they
must
*NL*
expect
him
back
in
nine
months
.
She
began
to
prepare
for
his
coming
,
*NL*
began
to
do
up
her
room
for
him
,
to
clean
the
furniture
,
to
wash
and
*NL*
put
up
new
hangings
and
so
on
.
Dounia
was
anxious
,
but
said
nothing
and
*NL*
helped
her
to
arrange
the
room
.
After
a
fatiguing
day
spent
in
continual
*NL*
fancies
,
in
joyful
day-dreams
and
tears
,
Pulcheria
Alexandrovna
was
*NL*
taken
ill
in
the
night
and
by
morning
she
was
feverish
and
delirious
.
*NL*
It
was
brain
fever
.
She
died
within
a
fortnight
.
In
her
delirium
she
*NL*
dropped
words
which
showed
that
she
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
her
*NL*
son
's
terrible
fate
than
they
had
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
Raskolnikov
did
not
know
of
his
mother
's
death
,
though
*NL*
a
regular
correspondence
had
been
maintained
from
the
time
he
reached
*NL*
Siberia
.
It
was
carried
on
by
means
of
Sonia
,
who
wrote
every
month
*NL*
to
the
Razumihins
and
received
an
answer
with
unfailing
regularity
.
At
*NL*
first
they
found
Sonia
's
letters
dry
and
unsatisfactory
,
but
later
on
*NL*
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
letters
could
not
be
better
,
for
*NL*
from
these
letters
they
received
a
complete
picture
of
their
unfortunate
*NL*
brother
's
life
.
Sonia
's
letters
were
full
of
the
most
matter-of-fact
*NL*
detail
,
the
simplest
and
clearest
description
of
all
Raskolnikov
's
*NL*
surroundings
as
a
convict
.
There
was
no
word
of
her
own
hopes
,
no
*NL*
conjecture
as
to
the
future
,
no
description
of
her
feelings
.
Instead
of
*NL*
any
attempt
to
interpret
his
state
of
mind
and
inner
life
,
she
gave
the
*NL*
simple
facts
--
that
is
,
his
own
words
,
an
exact
account
of
his
health
,
*NL*
what
he
asked
for
at
their
interviews
,
what
commission
he
gave
her
*NL*
and
so
on
.
All
these
facts
she
gave
with
extraordinary
minuteness
.
The
*NL*
picture
of
their
unhappy
brother
stood
out
at
last
with
great
clearness
*NL*
and
precision
.
There
could
be
no
mistake
,
because
nothing
was
given
but
*NL*
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dounia
and
her
husband
could
get
little
comfort
out
of
the
news
,
*NL*
especially
at
first
.
Sonia
wrote
that
he
was
constantly
sullen
and
not
*NL*
ready
to
talk
,
that
he
scarcely
seemed
interested
in
the
news
she
gave
*NL*
him
from
their
letters
,
that
he
sometimes
asked
after
his
mother
and
*NL*
that
when
,
seeing
that
he
had
guessed
the
truth
,
she
told
him
at
last
*NL*
of
her
death
,
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
did
not
seem
greatly
*NL*
affected
by
it
,
not
externally
at
any
rate
.
She
told
them
that
,
although
*NL*
he
seemed
so
wrapped
up
in
himself
and
,
as
it
were
,
shut
himself
off
*NL*
from
everyone
--
he
took
a
very
direct
and
simple
view
of
his
new
life
;
*NL*
that
he
understood
his
position
,
expected
nothing
better
for
the
time
,
*NL*
had
no
ill-founded
hopes
-LRB-
as
is
so
common
in
his
position
-RRB-
and
scarcely
*NL*
seemed
surprised
at
anything
in
his
surroundings
,
so
unlike
anything
he
*NL*
had
known
before
.
She
wrote
that
his
health
was
satisfactory
;
he
did
his
*NL*
work
without
shirking
or
seeking
to
do
more
;
he
was
almost
indifferent
*NL*
about
food
,
but
except
on
Sundays
and
holidays
the
food
was
so
bad
that
*NL*
at
last
he
had
been
glad
to
accept
some
money
from
her
,
Sonia
,
to
have
*NL*
his
own
tea
every
day
.
He
begged
her
not
to
trouble
about
anything
else
,
*NL*
declaring
that
all
this
fuss
about
him
only
annoyed
him
.
Sonia
wrote
*NL*
further
that
in
prison
he
shared
the
same
room
with
the
rest
,
that
she
*NL*
had
not
seen
the
inside
of
their
barracks
,
but
concluded
that
they
were
*NL*
crowded
,
miserable
and
unhealthy
;
that
he
slept
on
a
plank
bed
with
a
*NL*
rug
under
him
and
was
unwilling
to
make
any
other
arrangement
.
But
that
*NL*
he
lived
so
poorly
and
roughly
,
not
from
any
plan
or
design
,
but
simply
*NL*
from
inattention
and
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonia
wrote
simply
that
he
had
at
first
shown
no
interest
in
her
visits
,
*NL*
had
almost
been
vexed
with
her
indeed
for
coming
,
unwilling
to
talk
and
*NL*
rude
to
her
.
But
that
in
the
end
these
visits
had
become
a
habit
and
*NL*
almost
a
necessity
for
him
,
so
that
he
was
positively
distressed
when
*NL*
she
was
ill
for
some
days
and
could
not
visit
him
.
She
used
to
see
him
*NL*
on
holidays
at
the
prison
gates
or
in
the
guard-room
,
to
which
he
was
*NL*
brought
for
a
few
minutes
to
see
her
.
On
working
days
she
would
go
to
*NL*
see
him
at
work
either
at
the
workshops
or
at
the
brick
kilns
,
or
at
the
*NL*
sheds
on
the
banks
of
the
Irtish
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
herself
,
Sonia
wrote
that
she
had
succeeded
in
making
some
*NL*
acquaintances
in
the
town
,
that
she
did
sewing
,
and
,
as
there
*NL*
was
scarcely
a
dressmaker
in
the
town
,
she
was
looked
upon
as
an
*NL*
indispensable
person
in
many
houses
.
But
she
did
not
mention
that
the
*NL*
authorities
were
,
through
her
,
interested
in
Raskolnikov
;
that
his
task
*NL*
was
lightened
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
news
came
-LRB-
Dounia
had
indeed
noticed
signs
of
alarm
and
*NL*
uneasiness
in
the
preceding
letters
-RRB-
that
he
held
aloof
from
everyone
,
*NL*
that
his
fellow
prisoners
did
not
like
him
,
that
he
kept
silent
for
days
*NL*
at
a
time
and
was
becoming
very
pale
.
In
the
last
letter
Sonia
wrote
*NL*
that
he
had
been
taken
very
seriously
ill
and
was
in
the
convict
ward
of
*NL*
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
ill
a
long
time
.
But
it
was
not
the
horrors
of
prison
life
,
not
*NL*
the
hard
labour
,
the
bad
food
,
the
shaven
head
,
or
the
patched
clothes
*NL*
that
crushed
him
.
What
did
he
care
for
all
those
trials
and
hardships
!
*NL*
he
was
even
glad
of
the
hard
work
.
Physically
exhausted
,
he
could
at
*NL*
least
reckon
on
a
few
hours
of
quiet
sleep
.
And
what
was
the
food
to
*NL*
him
--
the
thin
cabbage
soup
with
beetles
floating
in
it
?
In
the
past
as
a
*NL*
student
he
had
often
not
had
even
that
.
His
clothes
were
warm
and
suited
*NL*
to
his
manner
of
life
.
He
did
not
even
feel
the
fetters
.
Was
he
ashamed
*NL*
of
his
shaven
head
and
parti-coloured
coat
?
Before
whom
?
Before
Sonia
?
*NL*
Sonia
was
afraid
of
him
,
how
could
he
be
ashamed
before
her
?
And
yet
he
*NL*
was
ashamed
even
before
Sonia
,
whom
he
tortured
because
of
it
with
*NL*
his
contemptuous
rough
manner
.
But
it
was
not
his
shaven
head
and
his
*NL*
fetters
he
was
ashamed
of
:
his
pride
had
been
stung
to
the
quick
.
It
was
*NL*
wounded
pride
that
made
him
ill
.
Oh
,
how
happy
he
would
have
been
if
he
*NL*
could
have
blamed
himself
!
He
could
have
borne
anything
then
,
even
*NL*
shame
and
disgrace
.
But
he
judged
himself
severely
,
and
his
exasperated
*NL*
conscience
found
no
particularly
terrible
fault
in
his
past
,
except
*NL*
a
simple
_
blunder
_
which
might
happen
to
anyone
.
He
was
ashamed
just
*NL*
because
he
,
Raskolnikov
,
had
so
hopelessly
,
stupidly
come
to
grief
*NL*
through
some
decree
of
blind
fate
,
and
must
humble
himself
and
submit
to
*NL*
``
the
idiocy
''
of
a
sentence
,
if
he
were
anyhow
to
be
at
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vague
and
objectless
anxiety
in
the
present
,
and
in
the
future
a
*NL*
continual
sacrifice
leading
to
nothing
--
that
was
all
that
lay
before
*NL*
him
.
And
what
comfort
was
it
to
him
that
at
the
end
of
eight
years
he
*NL*
would
only
be
thirty-two
and
able
to
begin
a
new
life
!
What
had
he
to
*NL*
live
for
?
What
had
he
to
look
forward
to
?
Why
should
he
strive
?
To
live
*NL*
in
order
to
exist
?
Why
,
he
had
been
ready
a
thousand
times
before
to
*NL*
give
up
existence
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
,
for
a
hope
,
even
for
a
fancy
.
*NL*
Mere
existence
had
always
been
too
little
for
him
;
he
had
always
wanted
*NL*
more
.
Perhaps
it
was
just
because
of
the
strength
of
his
desires
that
he
*NL*
had
thought
himself
a
man
to
whom
more
was
permissible
than
to
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
only
fate
would
have
sent
him
repentance
--
burning
repentance
that
*NL*
would
have
torn
his
heart
and
robbed
him
of
sleep
,
that
repentance
,
the
*NL*
awful
agony
of
which
brings
visions
of
hanging
or
drowning
!
Oh
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
glad
of
it
!
Tears
and
agonies
would
at
least
have
been
life
.
*NL*
But
he
did
not
repent
of
his
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
he
might
have
found
relief
in
raging
at
his
stupidity
,
as
he
*NL*
had
raged
at
the
grotesque
blunders
that
had
brought
him
to
prison
.
*NL*
But
now
in
prison
,
_
in
freedom
_
,
he
thought
over
and
criticised
all
his
*NL*
actions
again
and
by
no
means
found
them
so
blundering
and
so
grotesque
*NL*
as
they
had
seemed
at
the
fatal
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
,
''
he
asked
himself
,
``
was
my
theory
stupider
than
others
*NL*
that
have
swarmed
and
clashed
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
?
One
has
*NL*
only
to
look
at
the
thing
quite
independently
,
broadly
,
and
uninfluenced
*NL*
by
commonplace
ideas
,
and
my
idea
will
by
no
means
seem
so
...
strange
.
*NL*
Oh
,
sceptics
and
halfpenny
philosophers
,
why
do
you
halt
half-way
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
my
action
strike
them
as
so
horrible
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
because
it
was
a
crime
?
What
is
meant
by
crime
?
My
conscience
is
at
*NL*
rest
.
Of
course
,
it
was
a
legal
crime
,
of
course
,
the
letter
of
the
law
*NL*
was
broken
and
blood
was
shed
.
Well
,
punish
me
for
the
letter
of
the
*NL*
law
...
and
that
's
enough
.
Of
course
,
in
that
case
many
of
the
*NL*
benefactors
of
mankind
who
snatched
power
for
themselves
instead
of
*NL*
inheriting
it
ought
to
have
been
punished
at
their
first
steps
.
But
*NL*
those
men
succeeded
and
so
_
they
were
right
_
,
and
I
did
n't
,
and
so
I
*NL*
had
no
right
to
have
taken
that
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
in
that
that
he
recognised
his
criminality
,
only
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
had
been
unsuccessful
and
had
confessed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suffered
too
from
the
question
:
why
had
he
not
killed
himself
?
Why
*NL*
had
he
stood
looking
at
the
river
and
preferred
to
confess
?
Was
the
*NL*
desire
to
live
so
strong
and
was
it
so
hard
to
overcome
it
?
Had
not
*NL*
Svidrigailov
overcome
it
,
although
he
was
afraid
of
death
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
misery
he
asked
himself
this
question
,
and
could
not
understand
that
,
*NL*
at
the
very
time
he
had
been
standing
looking
into
the
river
,
he
had
*NL*
perhaps
been
dimly
conscious
of
the
fundamental
falsity
in
himself
and
*NL*
his
convictions
.
He
did
n't
understand
that
that
consciousness
might
be
*NL*
the
promise
of
a
future
crisis
,
of
a
new
view
of
life
and
of
his
future
*NL*
resurrection
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
preferred
to
attribute
it
to
the
dead
weight
of
instinct
which
he
*NL*
could
not
step
over
,
again
through
weakness
and
meanness
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
his
fellow
prisoners
and
was
amazed
to
see
how
they
all
loved
life
and
*NL*
prized
it
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
they
loved
and
valued
life
more
in
*NL*
prison
than
in
freedom
.
What
terrible
agonies
and
privations
some
of
*NL*
them
,
the
tramps
for
instance
,
had
endured
!
Could
they
care
so
much
for
*NL*
a
ray
of
sunshine
,
for
the
primeval
forest
,
the
cold
spring
hidden
away
*NL*
in
some
unseen
spot
,
which
the
tramp
had
marked
three
years
before
,
and
*NL*
longed
to
see
again
,
as
he
might
to
see
his
sweetheart
,
dreaming
of
the
*NL*
green
grass
round
it
and
the
bird
singing
in
the
bush
?
As
he
went
on
he
*NL*
saw
still
more
inexplicable
examples
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
prison
,
of
course
,
there
was
a
great
deal
he
did
not
see
and
did
not
*NL*
want
to
see
;
he
lived
as
it
were
with
downcast
eyes
.
It
was
loathsome
*NL*
and
unbearable
for
him
to
look
.
But
in
the
end
there
was
much
that
*NL*
surprised
him
and
he
began
,
as
it
were
involuntarily
,
to
notice
much
*NL*
that
he
had
not
suspected
before
.
What
surprised
him
most
of
all
was
*NL*
the
terrible
impossible
gulf
that
lay
between
him
and
all
the
rest
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
different
species
,
and
he
looked
at
them
and
they
at
*NL*
him
with
distrust
and
hostility
.
He
felt
and
knew
the
reasons
of
his
*NL*
isolation
,
but
he
would
never
have
admitted
till
then
that
those
reasons
*NL*
were
so
deep
and
strong
.
There
were
some
Polish
exiles
,
political
*NL*
prisoners
,
among
them
.
They
simply
looked
down
upon
all
the
rest
as
*NL*
ignorant
churls
;
but
Raskolnikov
could
not
look
upon
them
like
that
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
these
ignorant
men
were
in
many
respects
far
wiser
than
the
*NL*
Poles
.
There
were
some
Russians
who
were
just
as
contemptuous
,
a
former
*NL*
officer
and
two
seminarists
.
Raskolnikov
saw
their
mistake
as
clearly
.
*NL*
He
was
disliked
and
avoided
by
everyone
;
they
even
began
to
hate
him
at
*NL*
last
--
why
,
he
could
not
tell
.
Men
who
had
been
far
more
guilty
despised
*NL*
and
laughed
at
his
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
gentleman
,
''
they
used
to
say
.
``
You
should
n't
hack
about
with
*NL*
an
axe
;
that
's
not
a
gentleman
's
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
week
in
Lent
,
his
turn
came
to
take
the
sacrament
with
his
*NL*
gang
.
He
went
to
church
and
prayed
with
the
others
.
A
quarrel
broke
out
*NL*
one
day
,
he
did
not
know
how
.
All
fell
on
him
at
once
in
a
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
an
infidel
!
You
do
n't
believe
in
God
,
''
they
shouted
.
``
You
ought
*NL*
to
be
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
talked
to
them
about
God
nor
his
belief
,
but
they
wanted
to
*NL*
kill
him
as
an
infidel
.
He
said
nothing
.
One
of
the
prisoners
rushed
at
*NL*
him
in
a
perfect
frenzy
.
Raskolnikov
awaited
him
calmly
and
silently
;
*NL*
his
eyebrows
did
not
quiver
,
his
face
did
not
flinch
.
The
guard
*NL*
succeeded
in
intervening
between
him
and
his
assailant
,
or
there
would
*NL*
have
been
bloodshed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
question
he
could
not
decide
:
why
were
they
all
so
*NL*
fond
of
Sonia
?
She
did
not
try
to
win
their
favour
;
she
rarely
met
*NL*
them
,
sometimes
only
she
came
to
see
him
at
work
for
a
moment
.
And
yet
*NL*
everybody
knew
her
,
they
knew
that
she
had
come
out
to
follow
_
him
_
,
*NL*
knew
how
and
where
she
lived
.
She
never
gave
them
money
,
did
them
no
*NL*
particular
services
.
Only
once
at
Christmas
she
sent
them
all
presents
*NL*
of
pies
and
rolls
.
But
by
degrees
closer
relations
sprang
up
between
*NL*
them
and
Sonia
.
She
would
write
and
post
letters
for
them
to
their
*NL*
relations
.
Relations
of
the
prisoners
who
visited
the
town
,
at
their
*NL*
instructions
,
left
with
Sonia
presents
and
money
for
them
.
Their
wives
*NL*
and
sweethearts
knew
her
and
used
to
visit
her
.
And
when
she
visited
*NL*
Raskolnikov
at
work
,
or
met
a
party
of
the
prisoners
on
the
road
,
they
*NL*
all
took
off
their
hats
to
her
.
``
Little
mother
Sofya
Semyonovna
,
you
*NL*
are
our
dear
,
good
little
mother
,
''
coarse
branded
criminals
said
to
that
*NL*
frail
little
creature
.
She
would
smile
and
bow
to
them
and
everyone
was
*NL*
delighted
when
she
smiled
.
They
even
admired
her
gait
and
turned
round
*NL*
to
watch
her
walking
;
they
admired
her
too
for
being
so
little
,
and
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
did
not
know
what
to
admire
her
most
for
.
They
even
came
to
her
*NL*
for
help
in
their
illnesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
hospital
from
the
middle
of
Lent
till
after
Easter
.
When
*NL*
he
was
better
,
he
remembered
the
dreams
he
had
had
while
he
was
feverish
*NL*
and
delirious
.
He
dreamt
that
the
whole
world
was
condemned
to
a
*NL*
terrible
new
strange
plague
that
had
come
to
Europe
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
Asia
.
All
were
to
be
destroyed
except
a
very
few
chosen
.
Some
new
sorts
*NL*
of
microbes
were
attacking
the
bodies
of
men
,
but
these
microbes
were
*NL*
endowed
with
intelligence
and
will
.
Men
attacked
by
them
became
at
once
*NL*
mad
and
furious
.
But
never
had
men
considered
themselves
so
intellectual
*NL*
and
so
completely
in
possession
of
the
truth
as
these
sufferers
,
never
*NL*
had
they
considered
their
decisions
,
their
scientific
conclusions
,
their
*NL*
moral
convictions
so
infallible
.
Whole
villages
,
whole
towns
and
peoples
*NL*
went
mad
from
the
infection
.
All
were
excited
and
did
not
understand
*NL*
one
another
.
Each
thought
that
he
alone
had
the
truth
and
was
wretched
*NL*
looking
at
the
others
,
beat
himself
on
the
breast
,
wept
,
and
wrung
*NL*
his
hands
.
They
did
not
know
how
to
judge
and
could
not
agree
what
to
*NL*
consider
evil
and
what
good
;
they
did
not
know
whom
to
blame
,
whom
*NL*
to
justify
.
Men
killed
each
other
in
a
sort
of
senseless
spite
.
They
*NL*
gathered
together
in
armies
against
one
another
,
but
even
on
the
march
*NL*
the
armies
would
begin
attacking
each
other
,
the
ranks
would
be
broken
*NL*
and
the
soldiers
would
fall
on
each
other
,
stabbing
and
cutting
,
biting
*NL*
and
devouring
each
other
.
The
alarm
bell
was
ringing
all
day
long
in
*NL*
the
towns
;
men
rushed
together
,
but
why
they
were
summoned
and
who
was
*NL*
summoning
them
no
one
knew
.
The
most
ordinary
trades
were
abandoned
,
*NL*
because
everyone
proposed
his
own
ideas
,
his
own
improvements
,
and
they
*NL*
could
not
agree
.
The
land
too
was
abandoned
.
Men
met
in
groups
,
agreed
*NL*
on
something
,
swore
to
keep
together
,
but
at
once
began
on
something
*NL*
quite
different
from
what
they
had
proposed
.
They
accused
one
another
,
*NL*
fought
and
killed
each
other
.
There
were
conflagrations
and
famine
.
All
*NL*
men
and
all
things
were
involved
in
destruction
.
The
plague
spread
and
*NL*
moved
further
and
further
.
Only
a
few
men
could
be
saved
in
the
whole
*NL*
world
.
They
were
a
pure
chosen
people
,
destined
to
found
a
new
race
and
*NL*
a
new
life
,
to
renew
and
purify
the
earth
,
but
no
one
had
seen
these
*NL*
men
,
no
one
had
heard
their
words
and
their
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raskolnikov
was
worried
that
this
senseless
dream
haunted
his
memory
so
*NL*
miserably
,
the
impression
of
this
feverish
delirium
persisted
so
long
.
*NL*
The
second
week
after
Easter
had
come
.
There
were
warm
bright
spring
*NL*
days
;
in
the
prison
ward
the
grating
windows
under
which
the
sentinel
*NL*
paced
were
opened
.
Sonia
had
only
been
able
to
visit
him
twice
during
*NL*
his
illness
;
each
time
she
had
to
obtain
permission
,
and
it
was
*NL*
difficult
.
But
she
often
used
to
come
to
the
hospital
yard
,
especially
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
sometimes
only
to
stand
a
minute
and
look
up
at
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
ward
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
when
he
was
almost
well
again
,
Raskolnikov
fell
asleep
.
On
*NL*
waking
up
he
chanced
to
go
to
the
window
,
and
at
once
saw
Sonia
in
the
*NL*
distance
at
the
hospital
gate
.
She
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
someone
.
*NL*
Something
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
at
that
minute
.
He
shuddered
and
*NL*
moved
away
from
the
window
.
Next
day
Sonia
did
not
come
,
nor
the
day
*NL*
after
;
he
noticed
that
he
was
expecting
her
uneasily
.
At
last
he
was
*NL*
discharged
.
On
reaching
the
prison
he
learnt
from
the
convicts
that
*NL*
Sofya
Semyonovna
was
lying
ill
at
home
and
was
unable
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
uneasy
and
sent
to
inquire
after
her
;
he
soon
learnt
that
*NL*
her
illness
was
not
dangerous
.
Hearing
that
he
was
anxious
about
her
,
*NL*
Sonia
sent
him
a
pencilled
note
,
telling
him
that
she
was
much
better
,
*NL*
that
she
had
a
slight
cold
and
that
she
would
soon
,
very
soon
come
and
*NL*
see
him
at
his
work
.
His
heart
throbbed
painfully
as
he
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
it
was
a
warm
bright
day
.
Early
in
the
morning
,
at
six
o'clock
,
he
*NL*
went
off
to
work
on
the
river
bank
,
where
they
used
to
pound
alabaster
*NL*
and
where
there
was
a
kiln
for
baking
it
in
a
shed
.
There
were
only
*NL*
three
of
them
sent
.
One
of
the
convicts
went
with
the
guard
to
the
*NL*
fortress
to
fetch
a
tool
;
the
other
began
getting
the
wood
ready
and
*NL*
laying
it
in
the
kiln
.
Raskolnikov
came
out
of
the
shed
on
to
the
river
*NL*
bank
,
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
logs
by
the
shed
and
began
gazing
at
the
*NL*
wide
deserted
river
.
From
the
high
bank
a
broad
landscape
opened
before
*NL*
him
,
the
sound
of
singing
floated
faintly
audible
from
the
other
bank
.
*NL*
In
the
vast
steppe
,
bathed
in
sunshine
,
he
could
just
see
,
like
black
*NL*
specks
,
the
nomads
'
tents
.
There
there
was
freedom
,
there
other
men
were
*NL*
living
,
utterly
unlike
those
here
;
there
time
itself
seemed
to
stand
*NL*
still
,
as
though
the
age
of
Abraham
and
his
flocks
had
not
passed
.
*NL*
Raskolnikov
sat
gazing
,
his
thoughts
passed
into
day-dreams
,
into
*NL*
contemplation
;
he
thought
of
nothing
,
but
a
vague
restlessness
excited
*NL*
and
troubled
him
.
Suddenly
he
found
Sonia
beside
him
;
she
had
come
up
*NL*
noiselessly
and
sat
down
at
his
side
.
It
was
still
quite
early
;
the
*NL*
morning
chill
was
still
keen
.
She
wore
her
poor
old
burnous
and
the
*NL*
green
shawl
;
her
face
still
showed
signs
of
illness
,
it
was
thinner
and
*NL*
paler
.
She
gave
him
a
joyful
smile
of
welcome
,
but
held
out
her
hand
*NL*
with
her
usual
timidity
.
She
was
always
timid
of
holding
out
her
hand
*NL*
to
him
and
sometimes
did
not
offer
it
at
all
,
as
though
afraid
he
would
*NL*
repel
it
.
He
always
took
her
hand
as
though
with
repugnance
,
always
*NL*
seemed
vexed
to
meet
her
and
was
sometimes
obstinately
silent
throughout
*NL*
her
visit
.
Sometimes
she
trembled
before
him
and
went
away
deeply
*NL*
grieved
.
But
now
their
hands
did
not
part
.
He
stole
a
rapid
glance
*NL*
at
her
and
dropped
his
eyes
on
the
ground
without
speaking
.
They
were
*NL*
alone
,
no
one
had
seen
them
.
The
guard
had
turned
away
for
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
it
happened
he
did
not
know
.
But
all
at
once
something
seemed
to
*NL*
seize
him
and
fling
him
at
her
feet
.
He
wept
and
threw
his
arms
round
*NL*
her
knees
.
For
the
first
instant
she
was
terribly
frightened
and
she
*NL*
turned
pale
.
She
jumped
up
and
looked
at
him
trembling
.
But
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
she
understood
,
and
a
light
of
infinite
happiness
came
into
her
*NL*
eyes
.
She
knew
and
had
no
doubt
that
he
loved
her
beyond
everything
and
*NL*
that
at
last
the
moment
had
come
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
wanted
to
speak
,
but
could
not
;
tears
stood
in
their
eyes
.
They
*NL*
were
both
pale
and
thin
;
but
those
sick
pale
faces
were
bright
with
the
*NL*
dawn
of
a
new
future
,
of
a
full
resurrection
into
a
new
life
.
They
were
*NL*
renewed
by
love
;
the
heart
of
each
held
infinite
sources
of
life
for
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
resolved
to
wait
and
be
patient
.
They
had
another
seven
years
to
*NL*
wait
,
and
what
terrible
suffering
and
what
infinite
happiness
before
*NL*
them
!
But
he
had
risen
again
and
he
knew
it
and
felt
it
in
all
his
*NL*
being
,
while
she
--
she
only
lived
in
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
same
day
,
when
the
barracks
were
locked
,
*NL*
Raskolnikov
lay
on
his
plank
bed
and
thought
of
her
.
He
had
even
fancied
*NL*
that
day
that
all
the
convicts
who
had
been
his
enemies
looked
at
him
*NL*
differently
;
he
had
even
entered
into
talk
with
them
and
they
answered
*NL*
him
in
a
friendly
way
.
He
remembered
that
now
,
and
thought
it
was
bound
*NL*
to
be
so
.
Was
n't
everything
now
bound
to
be
changed
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
her
.
He
remembered
how
continually
he
had
tormented
her
*NL*
and
wounded
her
heart
.
He
remembered
her
pale
and
thin
little
face
.
*NL*
But
these
recollections
scarcely
troubled
him
now
;
he
knew
with
what
*NL*
infinite
love
he
would
now
repay
all
her
sufferings
.
And
what
were
all
,
*NL*
_
all
_
the
agonies
of
the
past
!
Everything
,
even
his
crime
,
his
sentence
*NL*
and
imprisonment
,
seemed
to
him
now
in
the
first
rush
of
feeling
an
*NL*
external
,
strange
fact
with
which
he
had
no
concern
.
But
he
could
not
*NL*
think
for
long
together
of
anything
that
evening
,
and
he
could
not
have
*NL*
analysed
anything
consciously
;
he
was
simply
feeling
.
Life
had
stepped
*NL*
into
the
place
of
theory
and
something
quite
different
would
work
itself
*NL*
out
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
his
pillow
lay
the
New
Testament
.
He
took
it
up
mechanically
.
*NL*
The
book
belonged
to
Sonia
;
it
was
the
one
from
which
she
had
read
the
*NL*
raising
of
Lazarus
to
him
.
At
first
he
was
afraid
that
she
would
worry
*NL*
him
about
religion
,
would
talk
about
the
gospel
and
pester
him
with
*NL*
books
.
But
to
his
great
surprise
she
had
not
once
approached
the
subject
*NL*
and
had
not
even
offered
him
the
Testament
.
He
had
asked
her
for
it
*NL*
himself
not
long
before
his
illness
and
she
brought
him
the
book
without
*NL*
a
word
.
Till
now
he
had
not
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
open
it
now
,
but
one
thought
passed
through
his
mind
:
``
Can
*NL*
her
convictions
not
be
mine
now
?
Her
feelings
,
her
aspirations
at
*NL*
least
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
too
had
been
greatly
agitated
that
day
,
and
at
night
she
was
taken
*NL*
ill
again
.
But
she
was
so
happy
--
and
so
unexpectedly
happy
--
that
she
was
*NL*
almost
frightened
of
her
happiness
.
Seven
years
,
_
only
_
seven
years
!
At
*NL*
the
beginning
of
their
happiness
at
some
moments
they
were
both
ready
*NL*
to
look
on
those
seven
years
as
though
they
were
seven
days
.
He
did
not
*NL*
know
that
the
new
life
would
not
be
given
him
for
nothing
,
that
he
would
*NL*
have
to
pay
dearly
for
it
,
that
it
would
cost
him
great
striving
,
great
*NL*
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
story
--
the
story
of
the
gradual
*NL*
renewal
of
a
man
,
the
story
of
his
gradual
regeneration
,
of
his
passing
*NL*
from
one
world
into
another
,
of
his
initiation
into
a
new
unknown
life
.
*NL*
That
might
be
the
subject
of
a
new
story
,
but
our
present
story
is
*NL*
ended
.
