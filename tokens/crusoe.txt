PREFACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
ever
the
story
of
any
private
man
's
adventures
in
the
world
were
*NL*
worth
making
public
,
and
were
acceptable
when
published
,
the
Editor
of
*NL*
this
account
thinks
this
will
be
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wonders
of
this
man
's
life
exceed
all
that
-LRB-
he
thinks
-RRB-
is
to
be
*NL*
found
extant
;
the
life
of
one
man
being
scarce
capable
of
a
*NL*
greater
variety
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
is
told
with
modesty
,
with
seriousness
,
and
with
a
religious
*NL*
application
of
events
to
the
uses
to
which
wise
men
always
apply
them
,
*NL*
viz
.
to
the
instruction
of
others
by
this
example
,
and
to
justify
and
*NL*
honour
the
wisdom
of
Providence
in
all
the
variety
of
our
circumstances
,
*NL*
let
them
happen
how
they
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
editor
believes
this
narrative
to
be
a
just
history
of
fact
;
neither
*NL*
is
their
any
appearance
of
fiction
in
it
:
and
though
he
is
well
aware
*NL*
there
are
many
,
who
on
account
of
the
very
singular
preservations
the
*NL*
author
met
with
,
will
give
it
the
name
of
romance
;
yet
in
which
ever
of
*NL*
these
lights
it
shall
be
viewed
,
he
imagines
,
that
the
improvement
of
*NL*
it
,
as
well
as
the
diversion
,
as
to
the
instruction
of
the
reader
,
will
*NL*
be
the
same
;
and
as
such
,
he
thinks
,
without
farther
compliment
to
the
*NL*
world
,
he
does
them
a
great
service
in
the
publication
.

THE
*NL*
*NL*
LIFE
AND
ADVENTURES
*NL*
*NL*
OF
*NL*
*NL*
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
born
at
York
,
in
the
year
1632
,
of
a
reputable
family
.
My
father
*NL*
was
a
native
of
Bremen
,
who
by
merchandizing
at
Hull
for
some
time
,
*NL*
gained
a
very
plentiful
fortune
.
He
married
my
mother
at
York
,
who
*NL*
received
her
first
breath
in
that
country
:
and
as
her
maiden
name
was
*NL*
Robinson
,
I
was
called
_
Robinson
Kreutznaer
_
:
which
not
being
easily
*NL*
pronounced
in
the
English
tongue
,
we
are
commonly
known
by
the
name
*NL*
of
Crusoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
the
youngest
of
three
brothers
.
The
eldest
was
a
lieutenant
*NL*
colonel
in
Lochart
's
regiment
,
but
slain
by
the
Spaniards
:
what
became
*NL*
of
the
other
,
I
could
never
learn
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
charge
or
pains
were
wanting
in
my
education
.
--
My
father
designed
me
*NL*
for
the
law
;
yet
nothing
would
serve
me
but
I
must
go
to
sea
,
both
*NL*
against
the
will
of
my
father
,
the
tears
of
my
mother
,
and
the
*NL*
entreaties
of
friends
.
One
morning
my
father
expostulated
very
warmly
*NL*
with
me
:
What
reason
,
says
he
,
have
you
to
leave
your
native
country
,
*NL*
where
there
must
be
a
more
certain
prospect
of
content
and
happiness
,
to
*NL*
enter
into
a
wandering
condition
of
uneasiness
and
uncertainty
?
He
*NL*
recommended
to
me
Augur
's
wish
,
``
Neither
to
desire
poverty
nor
riches
:
''
*NL*
that
a
middle
state
of
life
was
the
most
happy
,
and
that
the
high
*NL*
towering
thoughts
of
raising
our
condition
by
wandering
abroad
,
were
*NL*
surrounded
with
misery
and
danger
,
and
often
ended
with
confusion
and
*NL*
disappointment
.
I
entreat
you
,
nay
,
I
command
you
,
-LRB-
says
he
-RRB-
to
desist
*NL*
from
these
intentions
.
Consider
your
elder
brother
,
who
laid
down
his
*NL*
life
for
his
honour
,
or
rather
lost
it
for
his
disobedience
to
my
will
.
*NL*
If
you
will
go
-LRB-
added
he
-RRB-
my
prayers
shall
however
be
offered
for
your
*NL*
preservation
;
but
a
time
may
come
,
when
,
desolate
,
oppressed
,
or
*NL*
forsaken
,
you
may
wish
you
had
taken
your
poor
despised
father
's
*NL*
counsel
.
--
He
pronounced
these
words
with
such
a
moving
and
paternal
*NL*
eloquence
,
while
floods
of
tears
ran
down
his
aged
cheeks
,
that
it
*NL*
seemed
to
stem
the
torrent
of
my
resolutions
.
But
this
soon
wore
,
off
,
*NL*
and
a
little
after
I
informed
my
mother
,
that
I
could
not
settle
to
any
*NL*
business
,
my
resolutions
were
so
strong
to
see
the
world
;
and
begged
she
*NL*
would
gain
my
father
's
consent
only
to
go
one
voyage
;
which
,
if
I
did
*NL*
not
prove
prosperous
,
I
would
never
attempt
a
second
.
But
my
desire
was
*NL*
as
vain
as
my
folly
in
making
.
My
mother
passionately
expressed
her
*NL*
dislike
of
this
,
proposal
,
telling
me
,
``
That
as
she
saw
I
was
bent
upon
*NL*
my
own
destruction
,
contrary
to
their
will
and
my
duty
,
she
would
say
no
*NL*
more
;
but
leave
me
to
do
whatever
I
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
then
,
I
think
,
nineteen
years
old
,
when
one
time
being
Hull
;
I
met
*NL*
a
school-fellow
of
mine
,
going
along
with
his
father
,
who
was
master
of
*NL*
a
ship
,
to
London
;
and
acquainted
him
with
my
wandering
desires
;
he
*NL*
assured
me
of
a
free
passage
,
and
a
plentiful
share
of
what
was
*NL*
necessary
.
Thus
,
without
imploring
a
blessing
,
or
taking
farewell
of
my
*NL*
parents
,
I
took
shipping
on
the
first
of
September
1651
.
We
set
sail
*NL*
soon
after
,
and
our
ship
had
scarce
left
the
Humber
astern
,
when
there
*NL*
arose
so
violent
a
storm
,
that
,
being
extremely
sea-sick
,
I
concluded
*NL*
the
judgment
of
God
deservedly
followed
me
for
my
disobedience
to
my
*NL*
dear
parents
.
It
was
then
I
called
to
mind
,
the
good
advice
of
my
*NL*
father
;
how
easy
and
comfortable
was
a
middle
state
of
life
;
and
I
*NL*
firmly
resolved
,
if
it
pleased
God
to
set
me
on
dry
land
once
more
,
I
*NL*
would
return
to
my
parents
,
implore
their
forgiveness
,
and
bid
a
final
*NL*
adieu
to
my
wandering
inclinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
my
thoughts
while
the
storm
continued
:
but
these
good
*NL*
resolutions
decreased
with
the
danger
;
more
especially
when
my
companion
*NL*
came
to
me
,
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
:
``
What
,
Bob
!
''
said
he
,
``
sure
you
*NL*
was
not
frightened
last
night
with
scarce
a
capful
of
wind
?
''
--
``
And
do
*NL*
you
''
cried
I
,
``
call
such
a
violent
storm
a
capful
of
wind
?
''
--
``
A
storm
,
*NL*
you
fool
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
is
nothing
;
a
good
ship
and
sea-room
*NL*
always
baffles
such
a
foolish
squall
of
wind
as
that
:
But
you
're
a
fresh
*NL*
water
sailor
:
Come
boy
,
turn
out
,
see
what
fine
weather
we
have
now
,
and
*NL*
a
good
bowl
of
punch
will
drown
all
your
past
sorrows
.
''
In
short
,
the
*NL*
punch
was
made
,
I
was
drunk
and
in
one
night
's
time
drowned
both
my
*NL*
repentance
and
my
good
resolutions
,
forgetting
entirely
the
vows
and
*NL*
promises
I
made
in
my
distress
:
and
whenever
any
reflections
would
*NL*
return
on
me
,
what
by
company
,
and
what
by
drinking
,
I
soon
mastered
*NL*
those
fits
,
as
I
deridingly
called
them
.
But
this
only
made
way
for
*NL*
another
trial
,
whereby
I
could
not
but
see
how
much
I
was
beholden
to
*NL*
kind
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
sixth
day
we
came
to
an
anchor
in
Harwich
road
,
where
we
lay
*NL*
wind
bound
with
some
Newcastle
ships
;
and
there
being
good
anchorage
,
*NL*
and
our
cables
found
,
the
seamen
forgot
their
late
toil
and
danger
,
and
*NL*
spent
the
time
as
merry
as
if
they
had
been
on
shore
.
But
on
the
eight
*NL*
day
there
arose
a
brisk
gale
of
wind
,
which
prevented
our
tiding
it
up
*NL*
the
river
;
and
still
increasing
,
our
ship
rode
forecastle
in
,
and
*NL*
shipped
several
large
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
before
horror
seized
the
seamen
themselves
,
and
I
heard
*NL*
the
master
express
this
melancholy
ejaculation
,
``
Lord
have
mercy
upon
*NL*
us
,
we
shall
be
all
,
lost
and
undone
!
''
For
my
part
,
sick
unto
death
,
I
*NL*
kept
my
cabin
till
the
universal
and
terribly
dreadful
apprehensions
of
*NL*
our
speedy
fate
made
me
get
upon
deck
;
and
there
I
was
affrighted
*NL*
indeed
.
The
sea
went
mountains
high
:
I
could
see
nothing
but
distress
*NL*
around
us
;
two
ships
had
cut
their
masts
on
board
,
and
another
was
*NL*
foundered
;
two
more
that
had
lost
their
anchors
,
were
forced
out
to
the
*NL*
mercy
of
the
ocean
;
and
to
save
our
lives
we
were
forced
to
cut
our
*NL*
foremast
and
mainmast
quite
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
is
their
so
ignorant
as
not
to
judge
of
my
dreadful
condition
?
I
was
*NL*
but
a
fresh-water
sailor
and
therefore
it
seemed
more
terrible
.
Our
ship
*NL*
was
very
good
,
but
over-loaded
;
which
made
the
sailors
often
cry
out
,
*NL*
``
She
would
founder
!
''
Words
I
then
was
ignorant
of
.
All
this
while
the
*NL*
storm
continuing
,
and
rather
increasing
,
the
master
and
the
most
sober
*NL*
part
of
his
men
went
to
prayers
,
expecting
death
every
moment
.
In
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
night
one
cried
out
,
``
We
had
sprung
a
leak
;
''
another
,
*NL*
``
That
there
was
four
feet
water
in
the
hold
.
''
I
was
just
ready
to
expire
*NL*
with
fear
,
when
immediately
all
hands
were
called
to
the
pump
;
and
the
*NL*
men
forced
me
also
in
that
extremity
to
share
with
them
in
their
labour
.
*NL*
While
thus
employed
,
the
master
espying
some
light
colliers
,
fired
a
gun
*NL*
as
a
signal
of
distress
;
and
I
,
not
understanding
what
it
meant
,
and
*NL*
thinking
that
either
the
ship
broke
,
or
some
dreadful
thing
happened
,
*NL*
fell
into
a
swoon
.
Even
in
that
common
condition
of
woe
,
nobody
minded
*NL*
me
,
excepting
to
thrust
me
aside
with
their
feet
,
thinking
me
dead
,
and
*NL*
it
was
a
great
while
before
I
recovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
it
was
for
us
,
when
,
upon
the
signal
given
,
they
ventured
out
*NL*
their
boats
to
save
our
lives
.
All
our
pumping
had
been
in
vain
,
and
*NL*
vain
had
all
our
attempts
been
,
had
they
not
come
to
our
ship
's
side
,
*NL*
and
our
men
cast
them
a
rope
over
the
stern
with
a
buoy
to
it
,
which
*NL*
after
great
labour
they
got
hold
of
,
and
we
hauling
them
up
to
us
got
*NL*
into
their
boat
,
and
left
our
ship
which
we
perceived
sink
within
less
*NL*
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
thus
I
learned
what
was
meant
by
*NL*
_
foundering
at
sea
.
_
And
now
the
men
incessantly
laboured
to
recover
*NL*
their
,
own
ship
;
but
the
sea
ran
so
high
,
and
the
wind
blew
so
hard
,
*NL*
that
they
thought
it
convenient
to
hale
within
shore
;
which
,
with
great
*NL*
difficulty
and
danger
,
at
last
we
happily
effected
landing
at
a
place
*NL*
called
_
Cromer
_
,
not
far
from
Winterton
lighthouse
;
from
whence
we
all
*NL*
walked
to
Yarmouth
,
where
,
as
objects
of
pity
,
many
good
people
*NL*
furnished
us
with
necessaries
to
carry
us
either
to
Hull
or
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
,
after
all
this
,
like
the
prodigal
son
,
I
did
not
return
to
my
*NL*
father
;
who
hearing
of
the
ship
's
calamity
,
for
a
long
time
thought
me
*NL*
entombed
in
the
deep
.
No
doubt
but
I
should
have
_
shared
on
his
fatted
*NL*
calf
_
,
as
the
scripture
expresseth
it
;
but
my
ill
fate
still
pusheth
me
*NL*
on
,
in
spite
of
the
powerful
convictions
of
reason
and
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
been
at
Yarmouth
three
days
,
I
met
my
old
companion
,
who
had
*NL*
given
me
the
invitation
to
go
on
board
along
with
his
father
.
His
*NL*
behaviour
and
speech
were
altered
,
and
in
a
melancholy
manner
asked
me
*NL*
how
I
did
,
telling
his
father
who
I
was
,
&
how
I
had
made
this
voyage
*NL*
only
for
a
trial
to
proceed
further
abroad
.
Upon
which
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
turning
to
me
gravely
,
said
,
``
Young
man
,
you
ought
never
to
go
to
sea
*NL*
any
more
,
but
to
take
this
for
a
certain
sign
that
you
never
will
*NL*
prosper
in
a
sea-faring
condition
.
''
``
Sir
''
answered
I
,
``
will
you
take
the
*NL*
same
resolution
?
''
``
It
is
a
different
case
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
is
my
calling
,
*NL*
and
consequently
my
duty
;
but
as
you
have
made
this
voyage
for
a
trial
,
*NL*
you
see
what
ill
success
heaven
has
set
before
your
eyes
;
and
perhaps
*NL*
our
miseries
have
been
on
your
account
,
like
_
Jonah
_
in
the
ship
of
*NL*
_
Tarshish
_
.
But
pray
what
are
you
,
and
on
what
account
did
you
go
to
*NL*
sea
?
''
Upon
which
I
very
freely
declared
my
whole
story
:
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
he
made
this
exclamation
:
``
Ye
sacred
powers
:
what
had
I
committed
,
*NL*
that
such
a
wretch
should
enter
into
my
ship
to
heap
upon
me
such
a
*NL*
deluge
of
miseries
!
''
But
soon
recollecting
his
passion
,
``
Young
man
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
if
you
do
not
go
back
,
depend
upon
it
,
wherever
you
go
,
you
will
*NL*
meet
with
disasters
and
disappointments
till
your
father
's
words
are
*NL*
fulfilled
upon
you
.
''
And
so
we
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
at
first
to
return
home
;
but
shame
opposed
that
good
motion
,
*NL*
as
thinking
I
should
be
laughed
at
by
my
neighbours
and
acquaintance
.
So
*NL*
strange
is
the
nature
of
youth
,
who
are
not
ashamed
to
sin
,
but
yet
*NL*
ashamed
to
repent
;
and
so
far
from
being
ashamed
of
those
actions
for
*NL*
which
they
may
be
acounted
fools
,
they
think
it
folly
to
return
to
their
*NL*
duty
,
which
is
the
principal
mark
of
wisdom
.
In
short
I
travelled
up
to
*NL*
London
,
resolving
upon
a
voyage
,
and
a
voyage
I
soon
heard
of
,
by
my
*NL*
acquaintance
with
a
captain
who
took
a
fancy
to
me
,
to
go
to
the
coast
*NL*
of
Guinea
.
Having
some
money
,
and
appearing
like
a
gentleman
,
I
went
on
*NL*
board
,
not
as
a
common
sailor
or
foremast
man
;
nay
,
the
commander
agreed
*NL*
I
should
go
that
voyage
with
him
without
any
expence
;
that
I
should
be
*NL*
his
messmate
and
companion
,
and
I
was
very
welcome
to
carry
any
thing
*NL*
with
me
,
and
make
the
best
merchandise
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
blessed
my
happy
fortune
,
and
humbly
thanked
my
captain
for
this
*NL*
offer
;
and
acquainting
my
friends
in
Yorkshire
,
forty
pounds
were
sent
*NL*
me
,
the
greatest
part
of
which
my
dear
father
and
mother
contributed
to
,
*NL*
with
which
I
bought
toys
and
trifles
,
as
the
captain
directed
me
.
My
*NL*
captain
also
taught
me
navigation
,
how
to
keep
an
account
of
the
ship
's
*NL*
course
,
take
an
observation
,
and
led
me
into
the
knowledge
of
several
*NL*
useful
branches
of
the
mathematics
.
And
indeed
this
voyage
made
me
both
*NL*
a
sailor
and
a
merchant
;
for
I
brought
home
five
pounds
nine
ounces
of
*NL*
gold-dust
for
my
adventure
which
produced
,
at
my
return
to
London
,
*NL*
almost
three
hundred
pounds
.
But
in
this
voyage
I
was
extremely
sick
,
*NL*
being
thrown
into
a
violent
calenture
through
the
excessive
heat
,
*NL*
trading
upon
the
coast
from
the
latitude
of
fifteen
degrees
north
,
even
*NL*
to
the
line
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
alas
!
my
dear
friend
the
captain
soon
departed
this
life
after
his
*NL*
arrival
.
This
was
a
sensible
grief
to
me
;
yet
I
resolved
to
go
another
*NL*
with
his
mate
,
who
had
now
got
command
of
the
ship
.
This
proved
a
very
*NL*
unsuccessful
one
;
for
though
I
did
not
carry
quite
a
hundred
pounds
of
*NL*
my
late
acquired
wealth
,
-LRB-
so
that
I
had
two
hundred
pounds
left
,
which
I
*NL*
reposed
with
the
captain
's
widow
,
who
was
an
honest
gentlewoman
-RRB-
yet
my
*NL*
misfortunes
in
this
unhappy
voyage
were
very
great
.
For
our
ship
sailing
*NL*
towards
the
Canary
islands
,
we
were
chased
by
a
Salee
rover
;
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
the
haste
we
could
make
by
crowding
as
much
canvas
as
our
*NL*
yards
could
spread
,
or
our
masts
carry
,
the
pirate
gained
upon
us
,
to
*NL*
that
we
prepared
ourselves
to
fight
.
They
had
eighteen
guns
,
and
we
had
*NL*
but
twelve
.
About
three
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
desperate
*NL*
engagement
,
wherein
many
were
killed
and
wounded
on
both
sides
;
but
*NL*
finding
ourselves
overpowered
with
numbers
,
our
ship
disabled
and
*NL*
ourselves
too
impotent
to
have
the
least
hopes
of
success
,
we
were
*NL*
forced
to
surrender
;
and
accordingly
were
all
carried
prisoners
into
the
*NL*
port
of
Salee
.
Our
men
were
sent
to
the
Emperor
's
court
to
be
sold
*NL*
there
,
but
the
pirate
captain
taking
notice
of
me
,
kept
me
to
be
his
*NL*
own
slave
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
condition
,
I
thought
myself
the
most
miserable
creature
on
*NL*
earth
,
and
the
prophecy
of
my
father
came
afresh
into
my
thoughts
.
*NL*
However
,
my
condition
was
better
than
I
thought
it
to
be
,
as
will
soon
*NL*
appear
.
Some
hopes
indeed
I
had
that
my
new
patron
would
go
to
sea
*NL*
again
,
where
he
might
be
taken
by
a
Spanish
or
Portuguese
man
of
war
,
*NL*
and
then
I
should
be
set
at
liberty
.
But
in
this
I
was
mistaken
;
for
he
*NL*
never
took
me
with
him
,
but
left
me
to
look
after
his
little
garden
,
and
*NL*
do
the
drudgery
of
his
house
,
and
when
he
returned
from
sea
,
would
make
,
*NL*
me
lie
in
the
cabin
,
and
look
after
the
ship
.
I
had
no
one
that
I
could
*NL*
communicate
my
thoughts
to
,
which
were
continually
meditating
my
escape
;
*NL*
no
Englishman
,
Irishman
,
or
Scotchman
here
but
myself
;
and
for
two
years
*NL*
I
could
see
nothing
practicable
,
but
only
pleased
myself
with
the
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
length
of
time
,
my
patron
,
as
I
found
,
grew
;
so
poor
that
he
*NL*
could
not
fit
out
his
ship
as
usual
;
and
then
he
used
constantly
,
once
*NL*
or
twice
a
week
,
if
the
weather
was
fair
,
to
go
out
a
fishing
,
taking
me
*NL*
and
a
young
Moresco
Boy
to
row
the
boat
;
and
to
much
pleased
was
he
with
*NL*
me
for
my
dexterity
in
catching
the
fish
,
that
he
would
often
send
me
*NL*
with
a
Moor
,
who
was
one
of
his
kinsemen
,
and
the
Moresco
youth
,
to
*NL*
catch
a
dish
of
fish
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
as
we
were
at
the
sport
,
there
arose
such
a
thick
fog
that
*NL*
we
lost
sight
of
the
shore
;
and
rowing
we
knew
not
which
way
,
we
*NL*
laboured
all
the
night
,
and
in
the
morning
found
ourselves
in
the
ocean
,
*NL*
two
leagues
from
land
.
However
,
we
attained
there
at
length
,
and
made
*NL*
the
greater
haste
,
because
our
stomachs
were
exceedingly
sharp
and
*NL*
hungry
.
In
order
to
prevent
such
disasters
for
the
future
,
my
patron
*NL*
ordered
a
carpenter
to
build
a
little
state
room
or
cabin
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
long-boat
,
with
a
place
behind
it
to
steer
and
hale
home
the
*NL*
main-sheet
,
with
other
conveniences
to
keep
him
from
the
weather
,
as
*NL*
also
lockers
to
put
in
all
manner
of
provisions
,
with
a
handsome
*NL*
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
,
gibing
over
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
he
frequently
took
us
out
a
fishing
:
and
one
time
inviting
two
*NL*
or
three
persons
of
distinction
to
go
with
him
,
made
provision
*NL*
extraordinary
,
providing
also
three
fusees
with
powder
and
shot
,
that
*NL*
they
might
have
some
sport
at
fowling
along
the
sea-coast
.
The
next
*NL*
morning
the
boat
was
made
clean
,
her
ancient
and
pendants
on
,
and
every
*NL*
thing
ready
:
but
their
minds
altering
,
my
patron
ordered
us
to
go
a
*NL*
fishing
,
for
that
his
guests
would
certainly
sup
with
him
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
began
to
think
of
my
deliverance
indeed
.
In
order
to
this
I
*NL*
persuaded
to
Moor
to
get
some
provisions
on
board
,
as
not
daring
to
*NL*
meddle
with
our
patron
's
:
and
he
taking
my
advice
,
we
stored
ourselves
*NL*
with
rusk
biscuit
,
and
three
jars
of
water
.
Besides
,
I
privately
*NL*
conveyed
into
the
boat
a
bottle
or
brandy
,
some
twine
,
thread
,
a
hammer
,
*NL*
hatchet
,
and
a
saw
;
and
,
in
particular
,
some
bees
wax
,
which
was
a
great
*NL*
comfort
to
me
,
and
served
to
make
candles
.
I
then
persuaded
Muley
-LRB-
for
*NL*
so
was
the
Moor
called
-RRB-
to
procure
some
powder
and
shot
,
pretending
to
*NL*
kill
sea
curlues
,
which
he
innocently
and
readily
agreed
to
.
In
short
,
*NL*
being
provided
with
all
things
necessary
,
we
sailed
out
,
resolving
for
*NL*
my
own
part
to
make
my
escape
,
though
it
should
cost
me
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
passed
the
castle
,
we
fell
a
fishing
;
but
though
I
knew
*NL*
there
was
a
bite
,
I
dissembled
the
matter
,
in
order
to
put
out
further
*NL*
to
sea
.
Accordingly
we
ran
a
league
further
;
when
giving
the
boy
the
*NL*
helm
,
and
pretending
to
stoop
for
something
,
I
seized
Muley
by
surprise
*NL*
and
threw
him
overboard
.
As
he
was
an
excellent
swimmer
,
he
soon
arose
*NL*
and
made
towards
the
boat
;
upon
which
I
took
out
a
fusee
,
and
presented
*NL*
at
him
:
``
Muley
''
said
I
,
``
I
never
yet
designed
to
do
you
any
harm
,
and
*NL*
seek
nothing
now
but
my
redemption
.
I
know
you
are
able
enough
to
swim
*NL*
to
shore
,
and
save
your
life
:
but
if
you
are
resolved
to
follow
me
to
*NL*
the
endangering
of
mine
,
the
very
moment
you
proceed
,
I
will
shoot
you
*NL*
through
the
head
.
''
The
harmless
creature
at
these
words
,
turned
himself
*NL*
from
me
,
and
I
make
no
doubt
got
safe
to
land
.
Them
turning
to
the
boy
*NL*
Xury
,
I
perceived
he
trembled
at
the
action
:
but
I
put
him
out
of
all
*NL*
fear
,
telling
him
,
that
if
he
would
be
true
and
faithful
to
me
,
I
would
*NL*
do
well
by
him
.
``
And
therefore
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
must
stroke
your
face
to
*NL*
be
faithful
:
and
,
as
the
Turks
have
learned
you
,
swear
by
Mahomet
,
and
*NL*
the
beard
of
your
father
,
or
else
I
will
throw
you
into
the
sea
also
.
''
*NL*
So
innocent
did
the
child
then
look
,
and
with
such
an
obliging
smile
*NL*
consented
,
that
I
readily
believed
him
,
and
from
that
day
forward
began
*NL*
to
love
him
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
then
pursued
our
voyage
:
and
least
they
should
think
me
gone
to
the
*NL*
Straits
'
mouth
,
I
kept
to
the
southward
to
the
truly
Barbarian
coast
;
*NL*
but
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
,
I
changed
my
course
,
and
steering
*NL*
directly
S.
and
by
E.
that
I
might
keep
near
the
shore
:
and
,
having
a
*NL*
fresh
gale
of
wind
,
with
a
pleasant
smooth
sea
,
by
three
o'clock
next
*NL*
day
I
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
beyond
the
Emperor
of
Morocco
's
*NL*
dominions
.
Yet
still
having
the
dreadful
apprehensions
of
being
retaken
,
*NL*
I
continued
sailing
for
five
days
successively
,
till
such
time
as
the
*NL*
wind
shifting
to
the
southward
,
made
me
conclude
,
that
if
any
vessel
was
*NL*
in
the
chase
of
me
,
they
would
proceed
no
farther
.
After
so
much
fatigue
*NL*
and
thought
,
I
anchored
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
,
I
knew
not
what
*NL*
or
where
:
neither
did
I
then
see
,
any
people
.
What
I
principally
wanted
*NL*
was
fresh
water
;
and
I
was
resolved
about
dusk
to
swim
ashore
.
But
no
*NL*
sooner
did
the
gloomy
clouds
of
night
begin
to
succeed
the
declining
*NL*
day
,
when
we
heard
such
barking
,
roaring
,
and
howling
of
wild
creatures
,
*NL*
that
one
might
have
thought
the
very
strongest
monsters
of
nature
,
or
*NL*
infernal
spirits
had
their
residence
there
.
Poor
Xury
,
almost
dead
with
*NL*
fear
,
entreated
me
not
to
go
on
shore
that
night
.
``
Supposing
I
do
n't
,
*NL*
Xury
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
in
the
morning
we
should
see
men
who
are
worse
than
*NL*
those
we
fear
,
what
then
?
''
``
O
den
we
may
give
dem
de
shoot
gun
,
''
replied
*NL*
Xury
,
laughing
,
``
and
de
gun
make
dem
all
run
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wit
and
broken
English
which
the
boy
had
learned
among
the
captives
*NL*
of
our
nation
,
pleased
me
entirely
:
and
,
to
add
to
his
cheerfulness
I
*NL*
gave
him
a
dram
of
the
bottle
:
we
could
get
but
little
sleep
all
the
*NL*
night
for
those
terrible
howlings
they
made
;
and
,
indeed
,
we
were
both
*NL*
very
much
affrighted
,
when
,
by
the
rollings
of
the
water
,
and
other
*NL*
tokens
,
we
justly
concluded
one
of
these
monsters
made
towards
our
boat
.
*NL*
I
could
not
see
till
it
came
within
two
oars
length
,
when
taking
my
*NL*
fusee
,
I
let
fly
at
him
.
Whether
I
hit
him
or
no
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
*NL*
made
towards
the
shore
,
and
the
noise
of
my
gun
increased
the
*NL*
stupendious
noise
of
the
monsters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
I
was
resolved
to
go
on
shore
to
get
fresh
water
,
and
*NL*
venture
my
life
among
the
beasts
or
savages
should
either
attack
me
.
*NL*
Xury
said
,
he
would
take
one
of
the
jars
and
bring
me
some
.
I
asked
him
*NL*
why
he
would
go
and
not
I
?
The
poor
boy
answered
,
``
If
wild
mans
come
*NL*
they
eat
me
,
you
go
away
.
''
A
mind
scarcely
now
to
be
imitated
,
so
*NL*
contrary
to
self-preservation
,
the
most
powerful
law
of
Nature
.
This
*NL*
indeed
increased
my
affection
to
the
child
.
``
Well
,
dear
Xury
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
we
will
both
go
ashore
,
both
kill
wild
mans
,
and
they
``
shall
eat
neither
*NL*
of
us
.
''
So
giving
Xury
a
piece
of
rusk-bread
to
eat
,
and
a
dram
,
we
*NL*
waded
ashore
,
carrying
nothing
with
us
but
our
arms
,
and
two
jars
for
*NL*
water
.
I
did
not
go
out
of
sight
of
the
boat
,
as
dreading
the
savages
*NL*
coming
down
the
river
in
their
canoes
;
but
the
boy
seeing
a
low
descent
*NL*
or
vale
about
a
mile
in
the
country
,
he
wandered
to
it
:
and
then
running
*NL*
back
to
me
with
great
precipitation
,
I
thought
he
was
pursued
by
some
*NL*
savage
or
wild
beast
;
upon
which
I
approached
,
resolving
to
perish
or
*NL*
protect
him
from
danger
.
As
he
came
nearer
to
me
,
I
saw
something
*NL*
hanging
over
his
shoulders
,
which
was
a
creature
he
had
shot
like
a
*NL*
hare
,
but
different
in
colour
,
and
longer
legs
;
however
,
we
were
glad
of
*NL*
it
,
for
it
proved
wholesome
,
and
nourishing
meat
:
but
what
added
to
our
*NL*
joy
was
,
my
boy
assured
me
there
was
plenty
of
water
,
and
that
he
_
see
*NL*
no
wild
mans
.
_
And
greater
still
was
our
comfort
when
we
found
fresh
*NL*
water
in
the
creek
where
we
were
when
the
tide
was
out
,
without
going
so
*NL*
far
up
into
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
place
I
began
to
consider
that
the
Canary
and
Cape
de
Verde
*NL*
islands
lay
not
for
off
:
but
having
no
instrument
,
I
knew
not
what
*NL*
latitude
,
or
when
to
stand
off
to
sea
for
them
;
yet
my
hopes
were
,
I
*NL*
should
meet
some
of
the
English
trading
vessels
,
who
would
relieve
and
*NL*
take
us
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
I
was
in
was
no
doubt
that
wild
country
,
inhabited
only
by
a
*NL*
few
,
that
lies
between
the
Emperor
of
Morocco
's
dominions
and
the
*NL*
Negroes
.
It
is
filled
with
wild
beasts
and
the
Moors
use
it
for
hunting
*NL*
chiefly
.
--
From
this
place
I
thought
I
saw
the
top
of
the
mountain
*NL*
Teneriff
in
the
Canaries
:
which
made
me
try
twice
to
attain
it
:
but
as
*NL*
often
was
I
drove
back
,
and
so
forced
to
pursue
my
fortune
along
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
one
morning
we
came
to
an
anchor
under
a
little
point
of
land
,
but
*NL*
pretty
high
;
and
the
tide
beginning
to
flow
,
we
lay
ready
to
go
further
*NL*
in
--
But
Xury
,
whose
youthful
and
penetrating
eyes
were
sharper
then
*NL*
mine
,
in
a
soft
tone
,
desired
me
to
keep
far
from
land
,
lest
we
should
*NL*
be
devoured
,
``
For
look
yonder
,
mayter
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
see
de
dreadful
*NL*
monster
fast
asleep
on
de
side
of
de
hill
.
''
Accordingly
looking
where
he
*NL*
pointed
,
I
espied
a
fearful
monster
indeed
.
It
was
a
terrible
great
lion
*NL*
that
lay
on
shore
,
covered
as
it
were
by
a
shade
of
a
piece
of
the
hill
.
*NL*
``
Xury
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
shall
go
on
shore
and
kill
him
.
''
But
the
boy
looked
*NL*
amazed
:
``
Me
kill
him
!
''
says
he
,
``
he
eat
me
at
one
mouth
:
''
meaning
one
*NL*
mouthful
.
Upon
which
I
bid
him
lie
still
,
and
charging
my
biggest
gun
*NL*
with
two
slugs
,
and
a
good
charge
of
powder
,
I
took
the
best
aim
I
could
*NL*
to
shoot
him
through
the
head
,
but
his
leg
lying
over
his
nose
,
the
slug
*NL*
broke
his
knee-bone
.
The
lion
awaking
with
the
pain
,
got
up
,
but
soon
*NL*
fell
down
,
giving
the
most
hideous
groan
I
ever
heard
:
but
taking
my
*NL*
second
piece
,
I
shot
him
through
the
head
,
and
then
he
lay
struggling
*NL*
for
life
.
Upon
this
Xury
took
heart
and
desired
my
leave
to
go
on
shore
.
*NL*
``
Go
then
,
''
said
I.
Upon
which
taking
a
little
gun
in
one
hand
,
he
swam
*NL*
to
shore
with
the
other
,
and
coming
close
to
the
lion
,
put
a
period
to
*NL*
his
life
,
by
shooting
him
again
through
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
spending
our
ammunition
in
vain
,
the
flesh
not
being
good
*NL*
to
eat
.
Xury
was
like
a
champion
,
and
comes
on
board
for
a
hatchet
,
to
*NL*
cut
of
the
head
of
his
enemy
:
but
not
having
strength
to
perform
it
,
he
*NL*
cut
off
and
brought
me
a
foot
.
I
bethought
me
,
however
,
that
his
skin
*NL*
would
be
of
use
.
This
work
cost
Xury
and
me
a
whole
day
:
when
spreading
*NL*
it
on
the
top
of
our
cabin
,
the
hot
beams
of
the
sun
effectually
dried
*NL*
it
in
two
days
time
,
and
it
afterwards
served
me
for
a
bed
to
lie
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
we
sailed
southerly
,
living
sparingly
on
our
provisions
,
and
*NL*
went
no
oftener
on
shore
than
we
were
obliged
for
fresh
water
.
My
design
*NL*
was
to
make
the
river
Gambia
or
Senegal
,
or
any
where
about
the
Cape
de
*NL*
Verde
,
in
hopes
to
meet
some
European
ship
.
If
Providence
did
not
so
*NL*
favour
me
,
my
next
course
was
to
seek
for
the
islands
,
or
lose
my
life
*NL*
among
the
Negroes
.
And
in
a
word
,
I
put
my
whole
stress
upon
this
,
*NL*
``
Either
that
I
must
meet
with
some
ship
or
certainly
perish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
as
we
were
sailing
along
,
we
saw
people
stand
on
the
shore
*NL*
looking
at
us
:
we
could
also
perceive
they
were
black
and
stark
naked
.
I
*NL*
was
inclined
to
go
on
shore
,
but
Xury
cried
,
``
No
,
no
:
''
however
,
I
*NL*
approached
nearer
,
and
I
found
they
run
along
the
shore
by
me
a
good
*NL*
way
.
They
had
no
weapons
in
their
hands
,
except
one
,
who
held
a
long
*NL*
stick
,
which
Xury
told
me
was
a
lance
,
with
which
they
could
kill
at
a
*NL*
great
distance
.
I
talked
to
them
by
signs
and
made
them
sensible
I
*NL*
wanted
something
to
eat
:
they
beckoned
to
me
to
stop
my
boat
,
while
two
*NL*
of
them
ran
up
into
the
country
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
came
*NL*
back
,
and
brought
with
them
two
pieces
of
dried
flesh
,
and
some
corn
,
*NL*
which
we
kindly
accepted
;
and
to
prevent
any
fears
on
either
side
,
they
*NL*
brought
the
food
to
the
shore
,
laid
it
down
,
then
went
and
stood
a
great
*NL*
way
off
till
we
fetched
it
on
board
,
and
then
came
close
to
us
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
we
were
returning
thanks
to
them
,
being
all
we
could
afford
,
*NL*
two
mighty
creatures
came
from
the
mountains
:
one
as
it
were
pursuing
*NL*
the
other
with
great
fury
,
which
we
were
the
rather
inclined
to
believe
*NL*
as
they
seldom
appear
but
in
the
night
:
and
both
these
swiftly
passing
*NL*
by
the
Negroes
,
jumped
into
the
sea
,
wantonly
swimming
about
,
as
tho
'
*NL*
the
diversion
of
the
waters
had
put
a
stop
to
their
fierceness
.
At
last
*NL*
one
of
them
coming
nearer
to
my
boat
than
I
expected
or
desired
,
I
shot
*NL*
him
directly
through
the
head
;
upon
which
he
sunk
immediately
,
and
yet
*NL*
rising
again
,
would
have
willingly
made
the
shore
:
but
between
the
wound
*NL*
and
the
strangling
of
the
water
,
he
died
before
he
could
reach
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
consternation
the
poor
Negroes
were
in
*NL*
at
the
firing
of
my
gun
;
much
less
can
I
mention
their
surprise
,
when
*NL*
they
perceived
the
creature
to
be
slain
by
it
.
I
made
signs
to
them
to
*NL*
draw
near
it
with
a
rope
,
and
then
gave
it
them
to
hale
on
shore
.
It
was
*NL*
a
beautiful
leopard
,
which
made
me
desire
its
skin
:
and
the
Negroes
*NL*
seeming
to
covet
the
carcase
,
I
freely
gave
it
to
them
.
As
for
the
other
*NL*
leopard
,
it
made
to
shore
,
and
ran
with
prodigious
swiftness
out
of
*NL*
sight
.
The
Negroes
having
kindly
furnished
me
with
water
,
and
with
what
*NL*
roots
and
grains
their
country
afforded
,
I
took
my
leave
,
and
,
after
*NL*
eleven
days
sail
,
came
in
sight
of
the
Cape
de
Verde
,
and
those
islands
*NL*
called
by
its
name
.
But
the
great
distance
I
was
from
it
,
and
fearing
*NL*
contrary
winds
would
prevent
my
reaching
them
,
I
began
to
grow
*NL*
melancholy
and
dejected
,
when
,
upon
a
sudden
,
Xury
cried
out
,
``
Master
!
*NL*
Master
!
a
ship
with
a
sail
!
''
and
looked
as
affrighted
as
if
it
was
his
*NL*
master
's
ship
sent
in
search
of
us
.
But
I
soon
discovered
she
was
a
*NL*
Portuguese
ship
,
as
I
thought
bound
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
for
Negroes
.
*NL*
Upon
which
I
strove
for
life
to
come
up
to
them
.
But
vain
had
it
been
,
*NL*
if
through
their
perspective
glasses
they
had
not
perceived
me
and
*NL*
shortened
their
sail
to
let
me
come
up
.
Encouraged
at
this
,
I
set
up
my
*NL*
patron
's
ancient
,
and
fired
a
gun
,
both
as
signals
of
distress
;
upon
*NL*
which
they
very
kindly
lay
to
,
so
that
in
three
hours
time
I
came
up
*NL*
with
them
.
They
spoke
to
me
in
Portuguese
,
Spanish
,
and
French
,
but
*NL*
neither
of
these
did
I
understand
;
till
at
length
a
Scots
sailor
called
,
*NL*
and
then
I
told
him
I
was
an
Englishman
,
who
had
escaped
from
the
Moors
*NL*
at
Sallee
:
upon
which
they
took
me
kindly
on
board
,
with
all
my
effects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
none
can
express
the
inconceivable
joy
I
felt
at
this
happy
*NL*
deliverance
!
who
from
being
a
late
miserable
and
forlorn
creature
was
*NL*
not
only
relieved
,
but
in
favour
with
the
master
of
the
ship
,
to
whom
,
*NL*
in
return
for
my
deliverance
,
I
offered
all
I
had
.
``
God
forbid
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
that
I
should
take
any
thing
from
you
.
Every
thing
shall
be
*NL*
delivered
to
you
when
you
come
to
Brazil
.
If
I
have
saved
your
life
it
*NL*
is
no
more
than
I
should
expect
to
receive
myself
from
any
other
,
when
*NL*
in
the
same
circumstances
I
should
happen
to
meet
the
like
deliverance
.
*NL*
And
should
I
take
from
you
what
you
have
,
and
leave
you
at
Brazil
,
why
,
*NL*
this
would
be
only
taking
away
a
life
I
had
given
.
My
charity
teaches
me
*NL*
better
.
Those
effects
you
have
will
support
you
there
,
and
provide
you
a
*NL*
passage
home
again
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
he
acted
with
the
strictest
justice
in
*NL*
what
he
did
,
taking
my
things
into
his
possession
,
and
giving
me
an
*NL*
exact
inventory
,
even
to
my
earthen
jars
.
He
bought
my
boat
of
me
for
*NL*
the
ship
's
use
,
giving
me
a
note
of
eighty
pieces
of
eight
,
payable
at
*NL*
Brazil
;
and
if
any
body
offered
more
,
he
would
make
it
up
.
He
also
gave
*NL*
me
60
pieces
for
my
boy
Xury
.
It
way
with
great
reluctance
I
was
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
sell
the
child
's
liberty
,
who
had
served
me
so
*NL*
faithfully
;
but
the
boy
was
willing
himself
;
and
it
was
agreed
,
that
*NL*
after
ten
years
he
should
be
made
free
,
upon
his
renouncing
*NL*
Mahometanism
,
and
embracing
Christianity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
a
pleasant
voyage
to
the
Brazils
,
we
arrived
in
the
Bay
de
Todos
*NL*
los
Santos
,
or
All
Saints
Bay
,
in
twenty-two
days
after
.
And
here
I
*NL*
can
not
forget
the
generous
treatment
of
the
captain
.
He
would
take
*NL*
nothing
for
my
passage
,
gave
me
twenty
ducats
for
the
leopard
's
skin
,
*NL*
and
thirty
for
the
lion
's
.
Every
thing
he
caused
to
be
delivered
,
and
*NL*
what
I
would
sell
he
bought
.
In
short
I
made
about
220
pieces
of
my
*NL*
cargo
;
and
with
this
stock
I
entered
once
more
,
as
I
may
say
into
the
*NL*
scene
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
recommended
to
an
honest
planter
,
I
lived
with
him
till
such
time
*NL*
as
I
was
informed
of
the
manner
of
their
planting
and
making
sugar
;
and
*NL*
seeing
how
well
they
lived
,
and
how
suddenly
they
grew
rich
,
I
was
*NL*
filled
with
a
desire
to
settle
among
them
,
and
resolved
to
get
my
money
*NL*
remitted
to
me
,
and
to
purchase
a
plantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
brief
,
I
bought
a
settlement
next
door
to
an
honest
and
kind
*NL*
neighbour
,
born
at
Lisbon
,
of
English
parents
,
whose
plantation
joining
*NL*
to
mine
,
we
improved
it
very
amicably
together
.
Both
our
stocks
were
*NL*
low
,
and
for
two
years
we
planted
only
for
food
:
but
the
third
year
we
*NL*
planted
some
tobacco
,
and
each
of
us
dressed
a
large
piece
of
ground
the
*NL*
ensuing
year
for
planting
canes
.
But
now
I
found
how
much
I
wanted
*NL*
assistance
,
and
repented
the
loss
of
my
dear
boy
Xury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
none
to
assist
me
,
my
father
's
words
came
into
my
mind
;
and
I
*NL*
used
to
ask
myself
,
if
what
I
sought
was
only
a
middle
station
of
life
,
*NL*
why
could
it
not
as
well
be
obtained
in
England
as
here
?
When
I
pondered
*NL*
on
this
with
regret
,
the
thoughts
of
my
late
deliverance
forsook
me
.
I
*NL*
had
none
to
converse
with
but
my
neighbour
;
no
work
to
be
done
but
by
my
*NL*
own
hands
;
it
often
made
me
say
,
my
condition
was
like
to
that
of
a
man
*NL*
cast
upon
a
desolate
island
.
So
unhappy
are
we
in
our
reflections
,
so
*NL*
forgetful
of
what
good
things
we
receive
ourselves
,
and
so
unthankful
*NL*
for
our
deliverance
from
these
calamities
that
others
endure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
was
in
some
measure
settled
,
before
the
captain
who
took
me
up
*NL*
departed
from
the
Brazils
.
One
day
I
went
to
him
,
and
told
him
what
*NL*
stock
I
had
in
London
,
desiring
his
assistance
in
getting
it
remitted
;
*NL*
to
which
the
good
gentleman
readily
consented
,
but
would
only
have
me
*NL*
send
for
half
my
money
,
lest
it
should
miscarry
;
which
,
if
it
did
,
I
*NL*
might
still
have
the
remainder
to
support
me
:
and
so
taking
letters
of
*NL*
procuration
of
me
,
bid
me
trouble
myself
no
farther
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
indeed
wonderful
was
his
kindness
towards
me
;
for
he
not
only
*NL*
procured
the
money
I
had
drawn
for
upon
my
captain
's
widow
,
but
sent
me
*NL*
over
a
servant
with
a
cargo
proportionable
to
my
condition
.
He
also
sent
*NL*
me
over
tools
of
all
sorts
,
iron-work
,
and
utensils
necessary
for
my
*NL*
plantation
,
which
proved
to
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
me
in
my
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wealth
now
accumulating
on
me
,
and
uncommon
success
crowning
my
*NL*
prosperous
labours
,
I
might
have
rested
happy
in
that
middle
state
of
*NL*
life
my
father
had
so
often
recommended
,
yet
nothing
would
content
me
,
*NL*
such
was
my
evil
genius
,
but
I
must
leave
this
happy
station
,
for
a
*NL*
foolish
ambition
in
rising
;
and
thus
,
once
more
,
I
cast
myself
into
the
*NL*
greatest
gulph
of
misery
that
ever
poor
creature
fell
into
.
Having
lived
*NL*
four
years
in
Brazil
,
I
had
net
only
learned
the
language
,
but
*NL*
contracted
acquaintance
with
the
most
eminent
planters
,
and
even
the
*NL*
merchants
of
St.
Salvadore
;
to
whom
,
once
,
by
way
of
discourse
,
having
*NL*
given
account
of
my
two
voyages
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
and
the
manner
of
*NL*
trading
there
for
mere
trifles
,
by
which
we
furnish
our
plantations
with
*NL*
Negroes
,
they
gave
such
attention
to
what
I
said
,
that
three
of
them
*NL*
came
one
morning
to
me
,
and
told
me
they
had
a
secret
proposal
to
make
.
*NL*
After
enjoining
me
to
secrecy
-LRB-
it
being
an
infringement
on
the
powers
of
*NL*
the
Kings
of
Portugal
and
Spain
-RRB-
they
told
me
they
had
a
mind
to
fit
out
*NL*
a
ship
to
go
to
Guinea
,
in
order
to
stock
the
plantation
with
Negroes
,
*NL*
which
as
they
could
not
be
publicly
sold
,
they
would
divide
among
them
:
*NL*
and
if
I
would
go
their
supercargo
in
the
ship
,
to
manage
the
trading
*NL*
part
,
I
should
have
ah
equal
share
of
the
Negroes
,
without
providing
any
*NL*
stock
.
The
thing
indeed
was
fair
enough
,
had
I
been
in
another
*NL*
condition
.
But
I
,
born
to
be
my
own
destroyer
,
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
proposal
,
but
accepted
the
offer
upon
condition
of
their
looking
after
*NL*
my
plantation
.
So
making
a
formal
will
,
I
bequeathed
my
effects
to
my
*NL*
good
friend
the
captain
,
as
my
universal
heir
;
but
obliged
him
to
*NL*
dispose
of
my
effects
as
directed
,
one
half
of
the
produce
to
himself
,
*NL*
and
the
other
to
be
shipped
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ship
being
fitted
out
,
and
all
things
ready
,
we
set
sail
the
first
*NL*
of
September
,
1659
,
being
the
same
day
eight-years
I
left
my
father
and
,
*NL*
mother
in
Yorkshire
.
We
sailed
northward
upon
the
coast
,
in
order
to
*NL*
gain
Africa
,
till
we
made
Cape
Augustine
;
from
whence
going
farther
into
*NL*
the
ocean
,
out
of
sight
of
land
,
we
steered
as
though
we
were
bound
for
*NL*
the
isle
Fernand
de
Norenba
,
leaving
the
islands
on
the
east
;
and
then
*NL*
it
was
that
we
met
with
a
terrible
tempest
,
which
continued
for
twelve
*NL*
days
successively
,
so
that
the
wind
carried
us
wheresoever
they
pleased
.
*NL*
In
this
perplexity
one
of
our
men
died
,
and
one
man
and
a
boy
were
*NL*
washed
overboard
.
When
the
weather
cleared
up
a
little
,
we
found
*NL*
ourselves
eleven
degrees
north
latitude
,
upon
the
coast
of
Guinea
.
Upon
*NL*
this
the
captain
gave
reasons
for
returning
;
which
I
opposed
,
*NL*
counselling
him
to
stand
away
for
Barbadoes
,
which
as
I
supposed
,
might
*NL*
be
attained
in
fifteen
days
.
So
altering
our
course
,
we
sailed
*NL*
north-west
and
by
west
,
in
order
to
reach
the
Leeward
Islands
;
but
a
*NL*
second
storm
succeeding
,
drove
us
to
the
westward
;
so
that
we
were
*NL*
justly
afraid
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
cruel
savages
,
or
the
paws
of
*NL*
devouring
beasts
of
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
great
distress
,
one
of
our
men
,
early
in
the
morning
cried
out
,
*NL*
_
Land
,
land
!
_
which
he
had
no
sooner
cried
out
,
but
our
ship
struck
upon
*NL*
a
sand
bank
,
and
in
a
moment
the
sea
broke
over
her
in
such
a
manner
*NL*
that
we
expected
we
should
all
have
perished
immediately
.
We
knew
*NL*
nothing
where
we
were
,
or
upon
what
land
we
were
driven
;
whether
an
*NL*
island
or
the
main
,
inhabited
or
not
inhabited
;
and
we
could
not
so
much
*NL*
as
hope
that
the
ship
would
hold
out
many
minutes
,
without
breaking
in
*NL*
pieces
,
except
the
wind
by
a
miracle
should
turn
about
immediately
.
*NL*
While
we
stood
looking
at
one
another
,
expecting
death
every
moment
,
the
*NL*
mate
lay
a
hold
of
the
boat
,
and
with
the
help
of
the
rest
got
her
flung
*NL*
over
the
ship
's
side
,
and
getting
all
into
her
,
being
eleven
of
us
,
*NL*
committed
ourselves
to
God
's
mercy
and
the
wild
sea
.
And
now
we
saw
that
*NL*
this
last
effort
would
not
be
a
sufficient
protection
from
death
;
so
*NL*
high
did
the
sea
rise
,
that
it
was
impossible
the
boat
should
live
.
As
*NL*
to
making
sail
,
we
had
none
;
neither
if
we
had
,
could
we
make
use
of
*NL*
any
.
So
that
when
we
had
rowed
,
or
rather
were
driven
about
a
league
and
*NL*
a
half
,
a
raging
wave
,
like
a
lofty
mountain
,
came
rolling
astern
of
us
,
*NL*
and
took
us
with
such
fury
,
that
at
once
it
overset
the
boat
.
Thus
being
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
a
moment
,
we
had
hardly
time
to
call
upon
the
tremendous
*NL*
name
of
God
;
much
less
to
implore
,
in
dying
ejaculations
,
his
infinite
*NL*
mercy
to
receive
our
departing
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
are
generally
counted
insensible
,
when
struggling
in
the
pangs
of
*NL*
death
;
but
while
I
was
overwhelmed
with
water
,
I
had
the
most
dreadful
*NL*
apprehensions
imaginable
.
For
the
joys
of
heaven
and
the
torments
of
*NL*
hell
,
seemed
to
present
themselves
before
me
in
these
dying
agonies
,
and
*NL*
even
small
space
of
time
,
as
it
were
,
between
life
and
death
.
I
was
*NL*
going
I
thought
I
knew
not
whither
,
into
a
dismal
gulf
unknown
,
and
as
*NL*
yet
unperceived
,
never
to
behold
my
friends
,
nor
the
light
of
this
world
*NL*
any
more
!
Could
I
even
have
thought
of
annihilation
,
or
a
total
*NL*
dissolution
of
soul
as
well
as
body
,
the
gloomy
thoughts
of
having
no
*NL*
further
being
,
no
knowledge
of
what
we
hoped
for
,
but
an
eternal
*NL*
_
quietus
_
,
without
life
or
sense
:
even
that
,
I
say
,
would
have
been
*NL*
enough
to
strike
me
with
horror
and
confusion
!
I
strove
,
however
,
to
the
*NL*
last
extremity
,
while
all
my
companions
were
overpowered
and
entombed
in
*NL*
the
deep
:
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
I
kept
my
breath
till
the
*NL*
wave
spent
itself
,
and
retiring
back
,
left
me
on
the
shore
half
dead
*NL*
with
the
water
I
had
taken
in
.
As
soon
as
I
got
on
my
feet
,
I
ran
as
*NL*
fast
as
I
could
,
lest
another
wave
should
pursue
me
,
and
carry
me
back
*NL*
again
.
But
for
all
the
haste
I
made
,
I
could
not
avoid
it
:
for
the
sea
*NL*
came
after
me
like
a
high
mountain
,
or
furious
enemy
;
so
that
my
*NL*
business
was
to
hold
my
breath
,
and
by
raising
myself
on
the
water
,
*NL*
preserve
it
by
swimming
.
The
next
dreadful
wave
buried
me
at
once
twenty
*NL*
or
thirty
feet
deep
,
but
at
the
same
time
carried
me
with
a
mighty
force
*NL*
and
swiftness
toward
the
shore
:
when
raising
myself
,
I
held
out
as
well
*NL*
as
possible
,
till
at
length
the
water
having
spent
itself
,
began
to
*NL*
return
,
at
which
I
struck
forward
,
and
feeling
ground
with
my
feet
,
I
*NL*
took
to
my
heels
again
.
Thus
being
served
twice
more
,
I
was
at
length
*NL*
dashed
against
a
piece
of
a
rock
,
in
such
a
manner
as
left
me
senseless
;
*NL*
but
recovering
a
little
before
the
return
of
the
wave
,
which
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
would
then
have
overwhelmed
me
,
I
held
fast
by
the
rock
till
those
*NL*
succeeding
waves
abated
;
and
then
fetching
another
run
,
was
overtaken
by
*NL*
a
small
wave
,
which
was
soon
conquered
.
But
before
any
more
could
*NL*
overtake
me
,
I
reached
the
main
land
,
where
clambering
up
the
cliffs
of
*NL*
the
shore
,
tired
and
almost
spent
I
sat
down
on
the
grass
,
free
from
the
*NL*
dangers
of
the
foaming
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
tongue
can
express
the
ecstasies
and
transports
that
my
soul
felt
at
*NL*
the
happy
deliverance
.
It
was
like
a
reprieve
to
a
dying
malefactor
,
*NL*
with
a
halter
about
his
neck
,
and
ready
to
be
turned
off
.
I
was
wrapt
up
*NL*
in
contemplation
and
often
lifted
up
my
hands
,
with
the
profoundest
*NL*
humility
,
to
the
Divine
Powers
,
for
saving
,
my
life
,
when
the
rest
of
my
*NL*
companions
were
all
drowned
.
And
now
I
began
to
cast
my
eyes
around
,
to
*NL*
behold
what
place
I
was
in
and
what
I
had
next
to
do
.
I
could
see
no
*NL*
house
nor
people
;
I
was
wet
,
yet
had
no
clothes
to
shift
me
;
hungry
and
*NL*
thirsty
,
yet
had
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
;
no
weapon
to
destroy
any
*NL*
creature
for
my
sustenance
;
nor
defend
myself
against
devouring
beasts
;
*NL*
in
short
,
I
had
nothing
but
a
knife
,
a
tobacco
pipe
,
and
a
box
half
*NL*
filled
with
tobacco
.
The
darksome
night
coming
on
upon
me
,
increased
my
*NL*
fears
of
being
devoured
by
wild
creatures
;
my
mind
was
plunged
in
*NL*
despair
,
and
having
no
prospect
,
as
I
thought
,
of
life
before
me
,
I
*NL*
prepared
for
another
kind
of
death
then
what
I
had
lately
escaped
.
I
*NL*
walked
about
a
furlong
to
see
if
I
could
find
any
fresh
water
,
which
I
*NL*
did
,
to
my
great
joy
:
and
taking
a
quid
of
tobacco
to
prevent
hunger
,
I
*NL*
got
up
into
a
thick
bushy
tree
,
and
seating
myself
so
that
I
could
not
*NL*
fall
,
a
deep
sleep
overtook
me
,
and
for
that
night
buried
my
sorrows
in
*NL*
a
quiet
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
broad
day
the
next
morning
before
I
awaked
;
when
I
not
only
*NL*
perceived
the
tempest
was
ceased
,
but
law
the
ship
driven
almost
as
far
*NL*
as
the
rock
before-mentioned
,
which
the
waves
had
dashed
me
against
,
and
*NL*
which
was
about
a
mile
from
the
place
where
I
was
.
When
I
came
down
from
*NL*
my
apartment
in
the
tree
,
I
perceived
the
ship
's
boat
two
miles
distant
*NL*
on
my
right-hand
,
lying
on
shore
,
as
the
waves
had
cast
her
.
I
thought
*NL*
to
have
got
to
her
;
but
there
being
an
inlet
of
water
of
about
half
a
*NL*
mile
's
breadth
between
it
and
me
,
I
returned
again
towards
the
ship
,
as
*NL*
hoping
to
find
something
for
my
more
immediate
subsistence
.
About
noon
,
*NL*
when
the
sea
was
calm
,
that
I
could
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
*NL*
her
,
it
was
to
my
grief
I
perceived
,
that
,
if
we
had
kept
on
board
all
*NL*
our
lives
had
been
saved
.
These
thoughts
,
and
my
solitude
drew
tears
*NL*
from
my
eyes
,
though
all
in
vain
.
So
resolving
to
get
to
the
ship
,
I
*NL*
stripped
and
leapt
into
the
water
,
when
swimming
round
her
,
I
was
afraid
*NL*
I
should
not
get
any
thing
to
lay
hold
of
;
but
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
*NL*
espy
a
small
piece
of
rope
hang
down
by
the
fore
chains
,
so
low
that
,
by
*NL*
the
help
of
it
,
though
with
great
difficulty
,
I
got
into
the
forecastle
*NL*
of
the
ship
.
Here
I
found
that
the
ship
was
bulged
,
and
had
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
water
in
her
hold
:
her
stern
was
lifted
up
against
a
bank
,
and
her
*NL*
head
almost
to
the
water
.
All
her
quarter
and
what
was
there
,
was
free
*NL*
and
dry
.
The
provisions
I
found
in
good
order
,
with
which
I
crammed
my
*NL*
pockets
,
and
losing
no
time
,
ate
while
I
was
doing
other
things
:
I
also
*NL*
found
some
rum
,
of
which
I
took
a
hearty
dram
:
and
now
I
wanted
for
*NL*
nothing
except
a
boat
,
which
indeed
was
all
,
to
carry
away
what
was
*NL*
needful
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Necessity
occasions
quickness
of
thought
.
We
had
several
spare
yards
,
a
*NL*
spare
topmast
or
two
,
and
two
or
three
large
spars
of
wood
.
With
these
I
*NL*
fell
to
work
,
and
flung
as
many
of
them
overboard
as
I
could
manage
,
*NL*
tying
every
one
of
them
with
a
rope
,
that
they
might
not
drive
away
.
*NL*
This
done
,
I
went
down
to
the
ship
's
side
,
and
tyed
four
of
them
fast
*NL*
together
at
both
ends
,
in
form
of
a
raft
,
and
laying
two
or
three
short
*NL*
pieces
of
plank
upon
them
crosswise
,
I
found
it
would
bear
me
,
but
not
*NL*
any
considerable
weight
.
Upon
which
I
went
to
work
again
,
cutting
a
*NL*
spare
topmast
into
three
lengths
,
adding
them
to
my
raft
with
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
labour
and
pains
.
I
then
considered
what
I
should
load
it
with
,
*NL*
it
being
not
able
to
bear
a
ponderous
burden
.
And
this
I
soon
thought
*NL*
of
,
first
laying
upon
it
all
the
planks
and
boards
I
could
get
;
next
I
*NL*
lowered
down
three
of
the
seamen
's
chests
,
after
I
had
filled
them
with
*NL*
bread
,
rice
,
three
Dutch
cheeses
,
five
pieces
of
dried
goat
's
flesh
,
and
*NL*
some
European
corn
,
what
little
the
rats
had
spared
:
and
for
liquors
,
I
*NL*
found
several
cases
of
bottles
belonging
to
our
skipper
,
in
which
were
*NL*
some
cordial
waters
,
and
four
or
five
gallons
of
rack
,
which
I
stowed
by
*NL*
themselves
.
By
this
time
the
tide
beginning
to
flow
,
I
perceived
my
*NL*
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
shirt
,
swim
away
,
which
I
had
left
on
the
shore
;
as
*NL*
for
my
linen
breeches
and
stockings
,
I
swam
with
them
to
the
ship
;
but
I
*NL*
soon
found
clothes
enough
,
though
I
took
no
more
than
I
wanted
for
the
*NL*
present
.
My
eyes
were
chiefly
on
tools
to
work
with
;
and
after
a
long
*NL*
search
,
I
found
out
the
carpenter
's
chest
,
which
I
got
safe
down
on
my
*NL*
raft
.
I
then
looked
for
arms
and
ammunition
,
and
in
the
great
cabin
*NL*
found
two
good
fowling
pieces
,
two
pistols
,
several
powder
horns
filled
,
*NL*
a
small
bag
of
shot
,
and
two
old
rusty
swords
.
I
likewise
found
three
*NL*
barrels
of
powder
,
two
of
which
were
good
,
but
the
third
had
taken
*NL*
water
,
also
two
or
three
broken
oars
,
two
saws
,
an
ax
,
and
a
hammer
.
I
*NL*
then
put
to
sea
,
and
in
getting
to
shore
had
three
encouragements
.
1
.
A
*NL*
smooth
calm
sea
.
2
.
The
tide
rising
and
letting
in
to
shore
.
3
.
The
*NL*
little
wind
there
was
blew
towards
the
land
.
After
I
had
sailed
about
a
*NL*
mile
,
I
found
the
raft
to
drive
a
little
distance
from
the
place
where
I
*NL*
first
landed
;
and
then
I
perceived
a
little
opening
of
the
land
,
with
a
*NL*
strong
current
of
the
tide
running
into
it
:
upon
which
I
kept
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
stream
.
But
great
was
my
concern
,
when
on
a
sudden
the
fore
part
*NL*
of
my
raft
ran
a
ground
,
so
that
had
I
not
,
with
great
difficulty
,
for
*NL*
near
half
an
hour
,
kept
my
back
straining
against
the
chests
to
keep
my
*NL*
effects
in
their
places
,
all
I
had
would
have
gone
into
the
sea
.
But
*NL*
after
some
time
,
the
rising
of
the
water
caused
the
raft
to
float
again
,
*NL*
and
coming
up
a
little
river
with
land
on
both
sides
,
I
landed
in
a
*NL*
little
cove
,
as
near
the
mouth
as
possible
,
the
better
to
discover
a
*NL*
sail
,
if
any
such
providentially
passed
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
far
off
,
I
espied
a
hill
of
stupendous
height
,
surounded
with
lesser
*NL*
hills
about
it
,
and
thither
I
was
resolved
to
go
and
view
the
country
*NL*
that
I
might
see
what
part
was
best
,
to
fix
my
habitation
.
Accordingly
,
*NL*
arming
myself
with
a
pistol
a
fowling
piece
,
powder
and
ball
,
I
ascended
*NL*
the
mountain
.
There
I
perceived
I
was
in
an
island
,
encompassed
by
the
*NL*
sea
;
no
distant
lands
to
be
seen
but
scattering
rocks
that
lay
to
the
*NL*
west
:
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
barren
place
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
inhabited
*NL*
only
by
wild
beasts
.
I
perceived
abundance
of
fowls
,
but
ignorant
of
*NL*
what
kind
,
or
whether
good
for
nourishment
;
I
shot
one
of
them
at
my
*NL*
return
,
which
occasioned
a
confused
screaming
among
the
other
birds
,
and
*NL*
I
found
it
,
by
its
colours
and
beak
,
to
be
a
kind
of
a
hawk
,
but
its
*NL*
flesh
was
perfect
carrion
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
my
raft
,
I
brought
my
effects
on
shore
,
which
work
spent
*NL*
that
day
entirely
;
and
fearing
that
some
cruel
beasts
might
devour
me
in
*NL*
the
night
time
while
I
slept
,
I
made
a
kind
of
hut
or
barricade
with
the
*NL*
chests
and
boards
I
had
brought
onshore
.
That
night
I
slept
very
*NL*
comfortably
;
and
the
next
morning
my
thoughts
were
employed
to
make
a
*NL*
further
attempt
on
the
ship
,
and
bring
away
what
necessaries
I
could
*NL*
find
,
before
another
storm
should
break
her
to
pieces
.
Accordingly
I
got
*NL*
on
board
as
before
,
and
prepared
a
second
raft
far
more
nice
then
the
*NL*
first
,
upon
which
I
brought
away
the
carpenter
's
stores
,
two
or
three
*NL*
bags
full
of
nails
,
a
great
jack-screw
,
a
dozen
or
two
of
hatchets
,
and
*NL*
a
grind-stone
.
I
also
took
away
several
things
that
belonged
to
the
*NL*
gunner
,
particularly
two
or
three
iron
crows
,
two
barels
of
*NL*
musket-bullets
,
another
fowling-piece
,
a
small
quantity
of
powder
,
and
a
*NL*
large
bagful
of
small
shot
.
Besides
these
,
I
took
all
the
men
's
clothes
*NL*
I
could
find
,
a
spare
fore
topsail
,
a
hammock
,
and
some
bedding
;
and
*NL*
thus
completing
my
second
cargo
,
I
made
all
the
haste
to
shore
I
could
,
*NL*
fearing
some
wild
beast
might
destroy
what
I
had
there
already
.
But
I
*NL*
only
found
a
little
wild
cat
sitting
on
one
of
the
chests
,
which
seeming
*NL*
not
to
fear
me
or
the
gun
that
I
presented
at
her
,
I
threw
her
a
piece
*NL*
of
biscuit
,
which
she
instantly
ate
,
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
gotten
these
effects
on
shore
,
I
went
to
work
in
order
to
*NL*
make
me
a
little
tent
with
the
sail
and
some
poles
which
I
had
cut
for
*NL*
that
purpose
;
and
having
finished
it
,
what
things
might
be
damaged
by
*NL*
the
weather
I
brought
in
,
piling
all
the
empty
chests
and
calks
in
a
*NL*
circle
,
the
better
to
fortify
it
against
any
sudden
attempt
of
man
or
*NL*
beast
.
After
this
,
I
blocked
up
the
doors
with
some
boards
,
and
an
empty
*NL*
chest
,
turned
the
long
way
out
.
I
then
charged
my
gun
and
pistol
,
and
*NL*
laying
my
bed
on
the
ground
,
slept
as
comfortably
,
till
next
morning
,
as
*NL*
though
I
had
been
in
a
christian
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
I
had
enough
to
subsist
me
a
long
time
,
yet
despairing
of
a
*NL*
sudden
deliverance
,
or
that
both
ammunition
and
provision
might
be
spent
*NL*
before
such
a
thing
happened
,
I
coveted
as
much
as
I
could
;
and
so
long
*NL*
as
the
ship
remained
in
that
condition
,
I
daily
brought
away
one
*NL*
necessary
or
other
;
particularly
the
rigging
,
sails
,
and
cordage
,
some
*NL*
twine
,
a
barrel
of
wet
powder
,
some
sugar
,
a
barrel
of
meal
,
3
calks
of
*NL*
rum
,
&
,
what
indeed
was
most
welcome
to
me
,
a
whole
hogshead
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
I
went
I
cut
the
cables
in
pieces
,
carried
off
a
hawser
*NL*
whole
,
with
a
great
deal
of
iron
work
,
and
made
another
raft
with
the
*NL*
mizen
and
sprit-sail-yard
;
but
this
being
so
unwieldy
,
by
the
too
heavy
*NL*
burden
I
had
upon
it
,
and
not
being
able
so
dextrously
to
guide
it
,
as
*NL*
the
former
,
both
my
cargo
and
I
were
overturned
.
For
my
part
,
all
the
*NL*
damage
I
sustained
was
a
wet
skin
;
and
,
at
low
water
,
after
much
labour
*NL*
in
diving
,
I
got
most
of
the
cables
,
and
some
pieces
of
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirteen
days
I
had
now
been
in
the
island
,
and
eleven
times
on
board
,
*NL*
bringing
away
all
that
was
possible
,
and
,
I
believe
,
had
the
weather
*NL*
been
calm
,
I
should
have
brought
away
the
whole
ship
piece
by
piece
.
As
*NL*
I
was
going
the
twelfth
time
,
the
wind
began
to
rise
;
however
,
I
*NL*
ventured
at
low
water
,
and
rummaging
the
cabin
,
in
a
locker
I
found
*NL*
several
razors
,
scissors
,
and
some
dozens
of
knives
and
forks
;
and
in
*NL*
another
thirty-six
pounds
in
pieces
of
eight
,
silver
and
gold
.
_
Ah
!
*NL*
simple
vanity
_
said
I
_
whom
this
world
so
much
dotes
on
,
where
is
now
*NL*
thy
virtue
,
thy
excellency
to
me
?
You
can
not
procure
me
one
thing
*NL*
needful
,
nor
remove
me
from
this
desolate
island
to
a
place
of
plenty
.
*NL*
One
of
these
knives
,
so
meanly
esteemed
,
is
to
me
more
preferable
than
*NL*
all
this
heap
.
E'en
therefore
remain
where
thou
art
to
sink
in
the
deep
*NL*
as
unregarded
,
even
as
a
creature
whose
life
is
not
worth
preserving
.
_
*NL*
Yet
,
after
all
this
exclamation
,
I
wrapt
it
up
in
a
piece
of
canvas
,
*NL*
and
began
to
think
of
making
another
raft
,
but
I
soon
perceived
the
wind
*NL*
began
to
arise
,
a
fresh
gale
blowing
from
the
shore
,
and
the
sky
*NL*
overcast
with
clouds
and
darkness
;
so
thinking
a
a
raft
to
be
in
yaw
,
I
*NL*
let
myself
into
the
water
with
what
things
I
had
about
me
,
and
it
was
*NL*
with
much
difficulty
I
got
ashore
,
when
soon
after
it
blew
a
*NL*
fearful
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
slept
very
contentedly
in
my
little
tent
,
surrounded
with
*NL*
all
my
effects
;
but
when
I
looked
out
in
the
morning
no
more
ship
was
to
*NL*
be
seen
.
This
much
surprised
me
for
the
present
;
yet
,
when
I
considered
*NL*
I
had
lost
no
time
,
abated
no
pains
and
had
got
every
thing
useful
out
*NL*
of
her
,
I
comforted
myself
in
the
best
manner
,
and
entirely
submitted
to
*NL*
the
will
of
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
thoughts
were
,
how
I
should
defend
and
secure
myself
from
*NL*
savages
and
wild
beasts
,
if
any
such
were
in
the
island
.
At
one
time
I
*NL*
thought
of
digging
a
cave
,
at
another
I
was
for
erecting
a
tent
;
and
,
at
*NL*
length
,
I
resolved
to
do
both
:
The
manner
or
form
of
which
will
not
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
be
unpleasing
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
considered
the
ground
where
I
was
,
that
it
was
moorish
,
and
had
*NL*
no
fresh
water
near
it
,
my
resolutions
were
to
search
for
a
soil
healthy
*NL*
and
well
watered
,
where
I
might
not
only
be
sheltered
from
the
sun
's
*NL*
scorching
heat
,
but
be
more
conveniently
situated
,
as
well
to
be
secured
*NL*
from
wild
men
and
beasts
of
prey
,
as
more
easily
to
discover
any
distant
*NL*
sail
,
should
it
ever
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
it
was
not
long
before
I
had
my
desire
.
I
found
a
little
*NL*
plain
near
a
rising
hill
,
the
front
towards
which
being
as
steep
as
a
*NL*
house
side
,
nothing
could
descend
on
me
from
the
top
.
On
the
side
of
*NL*
this
rock
,
was
a
little
hollow
place
,
resembling
the
entrance
or
door
of
*NL*
a
cave
.
Just
before
this
place
;
on
the
circle
of
the
green
,
I
resolved
*NL*
my
tent
should
stand
.
This
plain
did
not
much
exceed
a
hundred
yards
*NL*
broad
,
and
about
twice
as
long
,
like
a
delightful
green
,
before
my
door
,
*NL*
with
a
pleasing
,
though
an
irregular
descent
every
way
to
the
low
*NL*
grounds
by
the
sea-side
,
lying
on
the
N.
W.
side
of
the
hill
,
so
that
it
*NL*
was
sheltered
from
the
excessive
heat
of
the
sun
.
After
this
,
I
drew
a
*NL*
semi-circle
,
containing
ten
yards
in
a
semi-diameter
,
and
twenty
yards
*NL*
in
the
whole
,
driving
down
two
rows
;
of
strong
stakes
,
not
6
inches
from
*NL*
each
other
.
Then
with
the
pieces
of
cable
which
I
had
cut
on
board
,
I
*NL*
regularly
laid
them
in
a
circle
between
the
piles
up
to
their
tops
,
*NL*
which
were
more
than
five
feet
out
of
the
earth
,
and
after
drove
another
*NL*
row
of
piles
looking
within
side
against
them
,
between
two
or
three
feet
*NL*
high
,
which
made
me
conclude
it
a
little
impregnable
castle
against
men
*NL*
and
beasts
.
And
for
my
better
security
I
would
have
no
door
,
but
entered
*NL*
in
and
came
out
by
the
help
of
a
ladder
,
which
I
also
made
.

*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
my
fence
and
fortress
,
into
which
I
carried
all
my
riches
,
*NL*
ammunition
,
and
stores
.
After
which
,
working
on
the
rock
,
what
with
dirt
*NL*
and
stones
I
dug
out
,
I
not
only
raised
my
ground
two
feet
,
but
made
a
*NL*
little
cellar
to
my
mansion-house
;
and
this
cost
me
many
days
labour
and
*NL*
pains
.
One
day
in
particular
a
shower
of
rain
falling
,
thunder
and
*NL*
lighting
ensued
,
which
put
me
in
terror
lest
my
powder
should
take
fire
,
*NL*
and
not
only
hinder
my
necessary
subsistence
,
by
killing
me
food
,
but
*NL*
even
blow
up
me
and
my
habitation
.
To
prevent
which
,
I
fell
to
making
*NL*
boxes
and
bags
,
in
order
to
separate
it
,
having
by
me
near
150lb
.
*NL*
weight
.
And
thus
being
established
as
king
of
the
island
,
every
day
I
*NL*
went
out
with
my
gun
to
see
what
I
could
kill
that
was
fit
to
eat
.
I
*NL*
soon
perceived
numbers
of
goats
but
very
shy
,
yet
having
watched
them
*NL*
narrowly
,
and
seeing
I
could
better
shoot
off
the
rocks
than
when
in
the
*NL*
low
grounds
,
I
happened
to
shoot
a
she-goat
suckling
a
young
kid
;
which
*NL*
not
thinking
its
dam
slain
,
stood
by
her
unconcerned
;
and
when
I
took
*NL*
the
dead
creature
up
,
the
young
one
followed
me
even
to
the
inclosure
.
I
*NL*
lifted
the
kid
over
the
pales
,
and
would
willingly
have
kept
it
alive
;
*NL*
but
finding
it
could
not
be
brought
to
eat
,
I
was
forced
to
slay
it
also
*NL*
for
my
subsistence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
entered
into
as
strange
a
scene
of
life
as
ever
any
man
was
in
,
I
*NL*
had
most
melancholy
apprehensions
concerning
my
deplorable
condition
:
*NL*
and
many
times
the
tears
would
plentifully
run
down
my
face
,
when
I
*NL*
considered
how
I
was
debarred
from
all
communications
with
human
kind
.
*NL*
Yet
while
these
disponding
cogitations
would
seem
to
make
me
accuse
*NL*
Providence
,
other
good
thoughts
would
interpose
and
reprove
me
after
*NL*
this
manner
:
Well
,
supposing
you
are
desolate
,
it
is
not
better
to
be
so
*NL*
than
totally
perish
?
Why
,
were
you
singled
out
to
be
saved
and
the
rest
*NL*
destroyed
?
Why
should
you
complain
,
when
not
only
your
life
is
*NL*
preserved
,
but
the
ship
driven
into
your
reach
,
in
order
to
take
what
*NL*
was
necessary
out
of
her
for
your
subsistence
?
But
to
proceed
,
it
was
,
*NL*
by
the
account
I
kept
,
the
30th
of
September
,
when
I
first
landed
on
*NL*
this
island
.
About
twelve
days
after
,
fearing
lest
I
should
lose
my
*NL*
reckoning
of
time
,
nay
,
even
forget
the
Sabbath
days
,
for
want
of
pen
,
*NL*
ink
,
and
paper
,
I
carved
with
a
knife
upon
a
large
post
,
in
great
*NL*
letters
;
and
set
it
up
:
in
the
similitude
of
a
cross
,
on
the
seashore
*NL*
where
I
landed
,
I
CAME
ON
SHORE
,
_
Sept.
_
30
1659
.
Every
day
I
cut
a
*NL*
notch
with
my
knife
on
the
sides
of
the
square
post
,
and
this
on
the
*NL*
Sabbath
was
as
long
again
as
the
rest
;
and
every
first
day
of
the
month
*NL*
as
long
again
as
that
long
one
.
In
this
manner
I
kept
my
calendar
,
*NL*
weekly
,
monthly
or
yearly
reckoning
of
time
.
But
had
I
made
a
more
*NL*
strict
search
-LRB-
as
afterwards
I
did
-RRB-
I
needed
not
have
set
up
this
mark
;
*NL*
for
among
the
parcels
belonging
to
the
gunner
,
carpenter
,
and
captain
's
*NL*
mate
,
I
found
those
very
things
I
wanted
;
particularly
pens
,
ink
,
and
*NL*
paper
.
So
I
found
two
or
three
compasses
,
some
mathematical
*NL*
instruments
,
dials
,
perspective
glasses
,
books
of
navigation
,
three
*NL*
English
Bibles
,
and
several
other
good
books
,
which
I
carefully
put
*NL*
up
.
--
Here
I
can
not
but
call
to
mind
our
having
a
dog
and
two
cats
on
*NL*
board
,
whom
I
made
inhabitants
with
me
in
my
castle
.
Though
one
might
*NL*
think
I
had
all
the
necessities
that
were
desirable
,
yet
still
I
found
*NL*
several
things
wanting
.
My
ink
was
daily
wasting
;
I
wanted
needles
,
*NL*
pins
,
and
thread
to
mend
or
keep
my
clothes
together
;
and
particularly
a
*NL*
spade
,
pickax
,
or
shovel
,
to
remove
the
earth
.
It
was
a
year
before
I
*NL*
finished
my
little
bulwark
;
and
having
some
intervals
of
relaxation
,
*NL*
after
my
daily
wandering
abroad
for
provision
,
I
drew
up
this
plan
,
*NL*
alternately
,
as
creditor
and
debtor
,
to
remind
me
of
the
miseries
and
*NL*
blessings
of
my
life
,
under
so
many
various
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
E
V
I
L
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
cast
upon
a
desolate
island
,
having
no
hopes
,
no
prospects
of
a
*NL*
welcome
deliverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
miserably
am
I
singled
out
from
the
enjoyment
or
company
of
all
*NL*
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
an
hermit
-LRB-
rather
should
I
say
a
lonely
anchorite
-RRB-
am
I
forced
from
*NL*
human
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
clothes
after
some
time
will
be
worn
out
;
and
then
I
shall
have
none
*NL*
to
cover
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
ammunition
is
wasted
,
then
shall
I
remain
without
any
defence
*NL*
against
wild
men
and
beasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
creature
,
no
soul
to
speak
to
;
none
to
beg
assistance
from
.
*NL*
Some
comfort
would
it
be
to
resound
my
woes
where
I
am
understood
,
and
*NL*
beg
assistance
where
I
might
hope
for
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
GOOD
*NL*
*NL*
But
yet
I
am
preserved
,
while
my
companions
are
perished
in
the
raging
*NL*
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
set
apart
to
be
spared
from
death
.
And
he
,
who
has
so
preserved
me
,
*NL*
can
deliver
me
from
this
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
have
food
to
eat
,
and
even
a
happy
prospect
of
subsistence
*NL*
while
life
endures
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
present
I
enjoy
what
is
absolutely
needful
;
and
the
climate
is
so
*NL*
hot
,
that
had
I
never
so
many
,
I
would
hardly
wear
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
if
it
does
,
I
see
no
danger
of
any
hurt
to
me
,
as
in
Africa
;
And
*NL*
what
if
I
had
been
cast
away
,
upon
that
coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
there
not
God
to
converse
to
,
and
is
not
he
able
to
relieve
thee
?
*NL*
Already
has
he
afforded
thee
sustenance
,
and
put
it
in
thy
power
to
*NL*
provide
for
thyself
till
he
sends
thee
a
deliverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
easing
my
mind
a
little
by
these
reflections
,
I
began
to
render
*NL*
my
life
as
easy
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
here
add
,
to
the
description
I
have
given
of
my
habitation
,
that
*NL*
having
raised
a
turf
wall
against
the
outside
of
it
,
I
thatched
it
so
*NL*
close
as
might
keep
it
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
;
I
also
*NL*
improved
it
within
,
enlarged
my
cave
,
and
made
a
passage
and
door
in
the
*NL*
rock
,
which
came
out
beyond
the
pale
of
my
fortification
.
I
next
*NL*
proceeded
to
make
a
chair
and
a
table
,
and
so
began
to
study
such
*NL*
mechanical
arts
as
seemed
to
me
practicable
.
When
I
wanted
a
plank
or
*NL*
board
I
hewed
down
a
tree
with
my
hatchet
,
making
it
as
thin
with
my
ax
*NL*
as
possible
,
and
then
smooth
enough
with
an
adz
to
answer
my
designs
:
*NL*
yet
though
I
could
make
no
more
this
way
than
one
board
out
of
a
tree
,
*NL*
in
length
of
time
I
got
boards
enough
to
shelter
all
my
stores
,
every
*NL*
thing
being
regularly
placed
,
and
my
guns
securely
hanging
against
the
*NL*
side
of
the
rock
.
This
made
it
a
very
pleasant
sight
to
me
,
as
being
the
*NL*
result
of
vast
labour
and
diligence
;
which
leaving
for
a
while
,
and
me
*NL*
to
the
enjoyment
of
it
,
I
shall
give
the
reader
an
account
of
my
Journal
*NL*
from
the
day
of
my
landing
,
till
the
fixing
and
settling
of
my
*NL*
habitation
,
as
heretofore
shown

_

_
.
I
unhappy
Robinson
Crusoe
,
having
suffered
*NL*
shipwreck
,
was
driven
on
this
desolate
island
,
which
I
named
the
*NL*
_
Desolate
Island
of
Despair
_
,
my
companions
being
swallowed
up
in
the
*NL*
tempestous
ocean
.
The
next
day
I
spent
in
consideration
of
my
unhappy
*NL*
circumstances
,
having
no
prospect
but
of
death
,
either
to
be
starved
*NL*
with
hunger
,
or
devoured
with
beasts
or
merciless
savages
.

_
Oct.

That
morning
,
with
great
comfort
,
I
beheld
the
ship
drove
*NL*
ashore
.
Some
hopes
I
had
,
that
when
the
storm
was
abated
I
might
be
able
*NL*
to
get
some
food
and
necessaries
out
of
her
,
which
I
conceived
were
not
*NL*
damaged
,
because
the
ship
did
stand
upright
.
At
this
time
I
lamented
the
*NL*
loss
of
my
companions
,
and
our
misfortune
in
leaving
the
vessel
.
When
I
*NL*
perceived
the
ship
as
it
were
lay
dry
,
I
waded
through
the
sands
,
then
*NL*
swam
aboard
,
the
weather
being
very
rainy
,
and
with
scarcely
any
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
14th
of
this
month
,
my
time
was
employed
in
making
voyages
,
every
*NL*
tide
getting
what
I
could
out
of
the
ship
.
The
weather
very
wet

uncertain

My

recovered
most
again
at
low
water
.

It
blew
hard
,
and
rained
night
and
day
,
when
the
ship
went
in
*NL*
pieces
,
so
that
nothing
was
seen
of
her
but
the
wreck
at
low

I
secured
my
goods
from

I
wandered
to
see
where
I
could
find
a
place
convenient
for

my
abode
.
I
fixed
upon
a
rock
in
the
evening
,
marked
out
a
half-moon
,
*NL*
intending
to
erect
a
wall
,
fortified
with
piles

lined
within
with

pieces
of
cables
,
and
covered
with
turf

I
erected

in

I
shot
two
wild

which
were
good
to

eat
,
and
in
the
afternoon
made
me
a
table

I
began
to
live
regularly

In
the
morning
I
allowed
myself
two
*NL*
or
three
hours
to
walk
out
with
my
gun
;
I
then
worked
till
near
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
afterwards
refreshed
myself
,
with
what
I
had
to
eat
.
From
*NL*
twelve
to
two
I
would
lie
down
to

out
with

shot
a

ca
with
a
soft
skin
,
*NL*
but
her
flesh
was
good
for
nothing
.
The
skins
of
those
I
killed
,
I
*NL*
preserved

In
my
return

I
perceived
many

was
terrified

made
off

I
had
like
to
have
spoiled
my

cutting
it

being
very
hard

exceedingly
heavy
;

with
much
labour

I
made
a
sort
of
a
spade
out
of
it

These
tools

I

carried
on

business

eighteen
days
I
allowed
for
enlarging
my
cave
,
that
it
might
serve
me
,
*NL*
not
only
for
a
warehouse
,
but
kitchen
,
parlour
,
and
cellar
.
I
commonly
*NL*
lay
in
the
tent
,
unless
the
weather
was
rainy
that
I
could
not
lie
dry

*NL*
So
wet
would
it
be
at
certain
seasons
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
cover
all
*NL*
within
the
pale
with
long
poles
,
in
the
form
of
rafters
,
leaning
against
*NL*
the
rock
,
and
loaded
them
with
flags
and
large
leaves
of
trees
,
*NL*
resembling
a
thatch

No

I
think

but
suddenly
a

great

of
the
top
broke
in
,
so
that
it
was
a
mercy
I
was
not
buried
*NL*
in
the
ruins

This
occasioned
a
great
deal
of
pains

trouble
to
me
,

before
I
could
make
it
firm
and
durable
.

nailed
up

shot

wounded

another
.
I
led
it
home
in
a
string
,
bound
up
its
leg
,
and
cured
it
in
a

little
time
;
at
length
it
became
so
tame
and
familiar
as
to
feed
before
*NL*
the
door
,
and
follow
me
where
I
pleased

This
put
me
in

up

Still
sultry
,
however
,
obliged
by
necessity
,
I
went
out
with
my
*NL*
gun
,
and
found
a
great
store
of
goats
in
the
valleys
;
they
were
*NL*
exceedingly
shy
,
nor
could
my
dog
hunt
them
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Jan.
_
3
to
14
.
My
employment
this
time
was
to
finish
the
wall
before
*NL*
described
,
and
search
the
island
.
I
discovered
a
kind
of
pigeons
like
*NL*
our
house-pigeons
in
a
nest
among
the
rocks
.
I
brought
them
home
,
nursed
*NL*
them
till
they
could
fly
,
and
then
they
left
me
.
After
this
,
I
shot
*NL*
some
,
which
proved
excellent
food
.
Some
time
I
spent
vainly
in
*NL*
contriving
to
make
a
cask
;
I
may
well
say
it
was
vain
,
because
I
could
*NL*
neither
joint
the
staves
;
nor
fix
the
heads
,
so
as
to
make
it
tight
:
So
,
*NL*
leaving
that
,
took
some
goat
's
tallow
I
had
about
me
,
and
a
little
okum
*NL*
for
the
wick
,
and
provided
myself
with
a
lamp
,
which
served
me
instead
*NL*
of
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
a
very
strange
event
happened
.
For
being
in
the
height
of
my
*NL*
search
,
what
should
come
into
my
hand
,
but
a
bag
,
which
was
used
to
hold
*NL*
corn
-LRB-
as
I
supposed
-RRB-
for
the
fowls
;
so
immediately
resolving
to
put
*NL*
gunpowder
in
it
,
I
shook
all
the
hulks
and
dirt
upon
one
side
of
the
*NL*
rock
,
little
expecting
what
the
consequences
would
be
.
The
rain
had
*NL*
fallen
plentifully
a
few
days
before
;
and
about
a
month
after
,
to
my
*NL*
great
amazement
something
began
to
lock
out
very
green
and
flourishing
;
*NL*
and
when
I
came
to
view
it
more
nicely
,
every
day
as
it
grew
,
I
found
*NL*
about
ten
or
twelve
ears
of
green
barley
appeared
in
the
very
same
shape
*NL*
and
make
as
that
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
scarce
express
the
agitations
of
my
mind
at
this
sight
.
Hitherto
I
*NL*
had
looked
upon
the
actions
of
this
life
no
otherwise
than
only
as
the
*NL*
events
of
blind
chance
and
fortune
.
But
now
the
appearance
of
this
*NL*
barley
,
flourishing
in
a
barren
soil
,
and
my
ignorance
in
not
conceiving
*NL*
how
it
should
come
there
,
made
me
conclude
_
that
miracles
were
not
yet
*NL*
ceased
:
_
nay
,
I
even
thought
that
God
had
appointed
it
to
grow
there
*NL*
without
any
seed
,
purely
for
my
sustenance
in
this
miserable
and
*NL*
desolate
island
.
And
indeed
such
great
effect
this
had
upon
me
,
that
it
*NL*
often
made
me
melt
into
tears
,
through
a
grateful
sense
of
God
's
*NL*
mercies
;
and
the
greater
still
was
my
thankfulness
,
when
I
perceived
*NL*
about
this
little
field
of
barley
some
rice
stalks
,
also
wonderfully
*NL*
flourishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
thus
pleased
in
mind
,
I
concluded
there
must
be
more
corn
in
the
*NL*
island
;
and
therefore
made
a
diligent
search
narrowly
among
the
rocks
;
*NL*
but
not
being
able
to
find
any
,
on
a
sudden
it
came
into
my
mind
,
how
I
*NL*
had
shaken
the
husks
of
corn
out
of
the
bag
,
and
then
my
admiration
*NL*
ceased
,
with
my
gratitude
to
the
Divine
Being
,
_
as
thinking
it
was
but
*NL*
natural
_
,
and
not
to
be
conceived
a
miracle
;
though
even
the
manner
of
*NL*
its
preservation
might
have
made
me
own
it
as
a
wonderful
event
of
God
's
*NL*
kind
providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
the
latter
end
of
June
when
the
ears
of
this
corn
ripened
,
*NL*
which
I
laid
up
very
carefully
together
with
20
or
30
stalks
of
rice
,
*NL*
expecting
one
day
I
should
reap
the
fruit
of
my
labour
;
yet
four
years
*NL*
were
expired
before
I
could
allow
myself
to
eat
any
barley-bread
,
and
*NL*
much
longer
time
before
I
had
any
rice
.
After
this
,
with
indefatigable
*NL*
pains
and
industry
for
three
or
four
months
,
at
last
I
finished
my
wall
*NL*
on
the
14th
,
of
April
,
having
no
way
to
go
into
it
,
but
by
ladder
*NL*
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
April
_
16
.
I
finished
my
ladder
,
and
ascended
it
;
afterwards
pulled
it
*NL*
up
,
then
let
it
down
on
the
other
side
,
and
descended
into
my
new
*NL*
habitation
,
where
I
had
space
enough
,
and
so
fortified
that
nothing
*NL*
could
attack
me
,
without
scaling
the
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
does
all
human
pains
and
industry
avail
,
if
the
blessing
of
God
*NL*
does
not
crown
our
labours
?
Or
who
can
stand
before
the
Almighty
,
when
*NL*
he
stretcheth
forth
his
arm
?
For
one
time
as
I
was
at
the
entrance
of
my
*NL*
cave
,
there
happened
such
a
dreadful
earthquake
,
that
not
only
the
roof
*NL*
of
the
cave
came
rumbling
about
my
ears
,
but
the
posts
seemed
to
crack
*NL*
terribly
at
the
same
time
.
This
put
me
in
great
amazement
;
and
running
*NL*
to
the
ladder
,
and
getting
over
the
wall
,
I
then
plainly
knew
it
was
an
*NL*
earthquake
,
the
place
I
stood
on
sustaining
three
terrible
shocks
in
*NL*
less
than
three
minutes
.
But
judge
of
my
terror
when
I
saw
the
top
of
a
*NL*
great
rock
roll
into
the
sea
;
I
then
expected
the
island
would
be
*NL*
swallowed
up
every
moment
:
And
what
made
the
scene
still
more
dreadful
,
*NL*
was
to
see
the
sea
thrown
into
the
most
violent
agitations
and
disorders
*NL*
by
this
tremendous
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
part
I
stood
like
a
criminal
at
the
place
of
execution
ready
to
*NL*
expire
.
At
the
moving
of
the
earth
,
I
was
,
as
it
were
,
sea-sick
;
and
*NL*
very
much
afraid
lest
the
rock
,
under
which
was
my
fence
and
habitation
,
*NL*
should
overwhelm
it
and
myself
in
a
lasting
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
third
dreadful
shock
had
spent
itself
,
my
spirits
began
to
*NL*
revive
;
yet
still
I
would
not
venture
to
ascend
the
ladder
,
but
*NL*
continued
fitting
,
not
knowing
what
I
should
do
.
So
little
grace
had
I
*NL*
then
,
as
only
to
say
_
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
_
and
no
sooner
was
the
*NL*
earthquake
over
,
but
that
pathetic
prayer
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
after
,
when
a
horrible
tempest
arose
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
attended
with
a
huricane
of
wind
.
The
sea
seemed
mountains
high
,
and
the
*NL*
waves
rolled
so
impetously
,
that
nothing
could
be
perceived
but
froth
*NL*
and
foam
.
Three
hours
did
this
storm
continue
,
and
in
so
violent
a
*NL*
manner
,
as
to
tear
the
very
trees
up
by
the
roots
,
which
was
succeeded
*NL*
by
abundance
of
rain
.
When
the
tempest
was
over
I
went
to
my
tent
:
but
*NL*
the
rain
coming
on
in
a
furious
manner
,
I
was
obliged
to
take
shelter
in
*NL*
the
cave
,
where
I
was
forced
to
cut
a
channel
through
my
fortification
*NL*
to
let
the
water
out
.
It
continued
raining
all
that
night
,
and
some
time
*NL*
the
next
day
.
These
accidents
made
me
resolve
,
as
soon
as
the
weather
*NL*
cleared
up
,
to
build
me
a
little
hut
in
some
open
place
,
walled
round
to
*NL*
defend
me
from
wild
creatures
and
savages
;
not
doubting
but
at
the
next
*NL*
earthquake
,
the
mountain
would
fall
upon
my
habitation
and
me
,
and
*NL*
swallow
up
all
in
its
bowels
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
April

--

.
These
days
I
spent
in
contriving
how
and
in
what
manner
*NL*
I
should
fix
my
place
of
abode
.
All
this
while
I
was
under
the
most
*NL*
dreadful
apprehensions
.
When
I
looked
round
my
habitation
,
every
thing
I
*NL*
found
in
its
proper
place
.
I
had
several
resolutions
whether
I
should
*NL*
move
or
not
;
but
at
length
resolved
to
stay
where
I
was
,
till
I
found
*NL*
out
a
convenient
place
where
I
might
pitch
my
tent
.

_

When
I
began
to
put
my
resolutions
in
practice
,
I
was
stopt
*NL*
for
want
of
tools
and
instruments
to
work
with
.
Most
of
my
axes
and
*NL*
hatchets
were
useless
,
occasioned
by
cutting
the
hard
timber
that
grew
*NL*
on
the
island
.
It
took
me
up
a
full
week
to
make
my
grind-stone
of
use
*NL*
to
me
,
and
at
last
I
found
out
a
way
to
turn
it
about
with
my
foot
,
by
*NL*
help
of
a
wheel
and
a
string
.

were

As
I
walked
along
the
sea
shore
I
found
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
,
*NL*
and
several
pieces
of
the
wreck
,
the
sea
had
flung
up
.
Having
secured
*NL*
those
,
I
made
to
the
ship
,
whose
stern
was
torn
off
,
and
washed
a
great
*NL*
distance
ashore
;
but
the
rest
lay
in
the
sands
.
This
I
suppose
was
*NL*
occasioned
by
the
earthquake
.
I
now
resolved
to
keep
my
old
place
of
*NL*
abode
;
and
also
to
go
to
the
ship
that
day
,
but
then
found
it
*NL*
impossible
.

went
on

with

sawed
off

of

beams
,
which
kept
her
quarter-deck
.
I
then
cleared
the
sand
till

This

I
also
repaired
to
the
wreck

and
sawed
another

piece
of
timber
,
and
when
the
flood
came
,
I
made
a
float
of
three
great

planks

were
driven
ashore

casks
floated
out
,
and
many
of
the
seamen
's
chests
,
yet
*NL*
that
day
nothing
came
to
land
but
pieces
of
timber
,
and
a
hogshead
which
*NL*
had
some
Brazil
pork
in
it
.
I
continued
working
to
the
15th
of
June
;
*NL*
-LRB-
except
necessary
times
for
food
and
rest
-RRB-
and
had
I
known
how
to
have
*NL*
built
a
boat
,
I
had
timber
and
planks
enough
;
I
had
also
near
100
weight
*NL*
of
sheet
lead
.

As
I
was
wandering
towards
the
sea-side
,
I
found
a
large
*NL*
tortoise
or
turtle
,
being
the
first
I
had
seen
on
the
island
,
though
,
as
*NL*
I
afterwards
found
,
there
were
many
on
the
other
side
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*

_
This
day
I
spent
in
cooking
it
,
found
in
her
threescore
eggs
,
*NL*
and
her
flesh
the
most
savoury
and
pleasant
I
ever
tasted
in
my
life
.

*NL*
_

_
I
staid
within
this
day
,
there
being
a
continual
rain
;
and
it
*NL*
was
somewhat
more
chilly
and
cold
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

_
Exceedingly
bad
,
being
taken
with
a
trembling
and
shivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

_
Awake
all
night
,
my
head
racked
with
pain
and
feverish
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

.
_
Sick
unto
death
,
and
terrified
with
the
dismal
apprehensions
*NL*
of
my
condition
.
Prayed
to
God
more
frequently
,
but
very
confusedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

_
Something
better
,
but
still
uneasy
in
my
mind

Again
relapsed
much
as

A
violent
ague
for
seven
hours
,
cold
and
hot
fits
succeeded
*NL*
with
faint
sweats
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

.
_
Better
,
but
very
weak
,
yet
I
scrambled
out
,
shot
a
she-goat
,
*NL*
brought
it
home
and
broiled
some
of
it
;
I
would
willingly
have
stewed
*NL*
it
,
and
made
some
broth
,
but
had
no
pod
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

_
All
this
day
I
was
afflicted
with
an
ague
;
thirsty
,
yet
I
*NL*
could
not
help
myself
to
water
:
Prayed
to
God
in
these
words
:
_
Lord
,
in
*NL*
pity
look
upon
me
:
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
:
have
mercy
upon
me
!
_
After
*NL*
this
I
fell
asleep
,
which
I
found
had
much
refreshed
me
when
I
awaked
.
I
*NL*
fell
fast
asleep
a
second
time
,
and
fell
into
this
strange
and
terrible
*NL*
sort
of
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Methought
I
was
sitting
on
the
same
spot
of
ground
at
the
outside
of
the
*NL*
wall
where
I
sat
when
the
storm
blew
after
the
earthquake
;
and
that
I
*NL*
saw
a
man
descending
from
a
great
black
cloud
,
and
alight
upon
the
*NL*
ground
.
He
was
all
over
as
bright
as
a
flash
of
fire
that
a
little
*NL*
before
surrounded
him
;
his
countenance
inconceivably
terrible
;
the
earth
*NL*
as
it
were
trembled
when
he
stept
upon
the
ground
,
and
flashes
of
fire
*NL*
seemed
to
fill
all
the
air
.
No
sooner
I
thought
him
landed
upon
the
*NL*
earth
,
but
with
a
long
spear
,
or
other
weapon
,
he
made
towards
me
;
but
*NL*
first
ascending
a
rising
ground
,
his
voice
added
to
my
amazement
,
when
I
*NL*
thought
I
heard
him
pronounce
these
dreadful
words
,
_
Unhappy
wretch
!
*NL*
seeing
all
these
things
have
not
brought
thee
to
repentance
,
thou
shalt
*NL*
immediately
die
.
_
In
pronouncing
this
dreadful
sentence
,
I
thought
he
*NL*
went
to
kill
me
with
the
spear
that
was
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
body
may
think
it
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
horrors
of
my
*NL*
mind
at
this
vision
:
and
even
when
I
awaked
,
this
very
dream
made
a
deep
*NL*
impression
upon
my
mind
.
The
little
divine
knowledge
I
had
,
I
received
*NL*
from
my
father
's
instructions
,
and
that
was
worn
out
by
an
uninterrupted
*NL*
series
of
sea-faring
impiety
for
eight
years
space
.
Except
what
sickness
*NL*
forced
from
me
,
I
do
not
remember
I
had
one
thought
of
lifting
up
my
*NL*
heart
towards
God
,
but
rather
had
a
certain
stupidity
of
soul
,
not
*NL*
having
the
least
sense
or
fear
of
the
Omnipotent
Being
when
in
distress
,
*NL*
nor
of
gratitude
to
him
for
his
deliverances
.
Nay
,
when
I
was
on
the
*NL*
desperate
expedition
on
the
desert
African
shore
,
I
can
not
remember
I
*NL*
had
one
thought
of
what
would
become
of
me
,
or
to
beg
his
consolation
*NL*
and
assistance
in
my
sufferings
and
distress
.
When
the
Portugal
captain
*NL*
took
me
up
and
honorably
used
me
,
nay
,
farther
,
when
I
was
even
*NL*
delivered
from
drowning
by
escaping
to
this
island
,
I
never
looked
upon
*NL*
it
as
a
judgment
,
but
only
said
I
was
an
unfortunate
dog
,
and
that
's
*NL*
all
.
Indeed
some
secret
transports
of
soul
I
had
,
which
was
not
through
*NL*
grace
but
only
a
common
flight
of
joy
,
that
I
was
yet
alive
,
when
my
*NL*
companions
were
all
drowned
,
and
no
other
joy
could
I
conceive
but
what
*NL*
is
common
with
the
sailors
over
a
bowl
of
punch
,
after
they
have
escaped
*NL*
the
greatest
dangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
likelihood
of
wanting
for
neither
food
nor
conveniences
,
might
have
*NL*
called
upon
me
for
a
thankful
acknowledgment
to
Providence
.
Indeed
,
the
*NL*
growth
of
my
corn
touched
with
some
sense
,
but
that
soon
wore
off
again
.
*NL*
The
terrible
earthquake
pointed
to
me
,
as
it
were
,
the
finger
of
God
,
*NL*
but
my
dreadful
amazement
continued
no
longer
than
its
duration
.
But
*NL*
now
,
when
my
spirits
began
to
sink
under
the
burden
of
a
strong
*NL*
distemper
,
and
I
could
leisurely
view
the
miseries
of
death
present
*NL*
themselves
before
my
eyes
,
then
my
awakened
conscience
began
to
reproach
*NL*
me
with
my
past
life
,
in
which
I
had
so
wickedly
provoked
the
justice
of
*NL*
God
to
pour
down
his
vengeance
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
reflections
as
these
oppressed
me
even
in
the
violence
of
*NL*
distemper
.
Some
prayers
I
uttered
,
which
only
proceeded
from
the
fear
of
*NL*
death
.
But
when
I
considered
my
father
's
advice
and
prophecy
,
I
could
*NL*
not
forbear
weeping
;
for
he
told
me
,
_
That
if
I
did
persist
in
my
folly
,
*NL*
I
should
not
only
be
deprived
of
God
's
blessing
,
but
have
time
enough
to
*NL*
reflect
upon
my
despising
his
instructions
,
and
this
,
in
a
wretched
*NL*
time
,
when
none
could
help
me
_
.
And
now
concluding
it
to
be
fulfilled
,
*NL*
having
no
soul
in
the
island
to
administer
any
comfort
to
me
,
I
prayed
*NL*
earnestly
to
the
Lord
,
that
he
would
help
me
in
this
great
calamity
.
And
*NL*
this
,
I
think
,
was
the
first
time
I
prayed
in
sincerity
for
many
years
.
*NL*
But
now
I
must
return
to
my
journal
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June
_
28
.
Something
refreshed
with
sleep
,
and
the
fit
quite
off
,
I
got
*NL*
up
.
My
dream
still
occasioned
in
me
a
great
consternation
;
and
,
fearing
*NL*
that
the
ague
might
return
the
succeeding
day
,
I
concluded
it
time
to
*NL*
get
something
to
comfort
me
.
I
filled
a
case
bottle
with
water
,
and
set
*NL*
it
within
reach
of
my
bed
;
and
,
to
make
it
more
nourishing
and
less
*NL*
chilly
,
I
put
some
rum
in
it
.
The
next
thing
I
did
was
to
broil
me
a
*NL*
piece
of
goat
's
flesh
,
of
which
I
ate
but
little
.
I
was
very
weak
;
*NL*
however
,
walked
about
,
dreading
the
return
of
my
distemper
;
and
at
night
*NL*
I
supped
on
three
of
the
turtle
's
eggs
,
which
I
roasted
and
ate
,
begging
*NL*
God
's
blessing
therewith
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
eaten
,
I
attempted
to
walk
again
out
of
doors
with
my
gun
;
*NL*
but
was
so
weak
,
that
I
sat
down
,
and
looked
at
the
sea
,
which
was
*NL*
smooth
and
calm
.
While
I
continued
here
,
these
thoughts
came
into
*NL*
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
manner
is
the
production
of
the
earth
and
sea
,
of
which
I
have
*NL*
seen
so
much
?
From
whence
came
myself
,
and
all
other
creatures
living
,
*NL*
and
of
what
are
they
made
?
*NL*
*NL*
Our
beings
were
assuredly
created
by
some
almighty
invisible
Power
,
who
*NL*
framed
the
earth
the
sea
,
and
air
,
and
all
therein
.
But
what
is
*NL*
that
Power
?
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
it
must
follow
that
God
has
created
it
all
.
Yet
,
said
I
,
if
*NL*
God
has
made
all
this
he
must
be
the
Ruler
of
them
all
,
and
what
is
*NL*
relating
thereto
;
for
certainly
the
Power
that
makes
,
must
indisputably
*NL*
have
a
power
to
guide
and
direct
them
.
And
if
this
be
so
,
-LRB-
as
certainly
*NL*
it
must
-RRB-
nothing
can
happen
without
his
knowledge
and
appointment
.
Then
,
*NL*
surely
,
if
nothing
happens
without
God
's
appointment
,
certainly
God
has
*NL*
appointed
these
my
sufferings
to
befal
me
.
And
here
I
fixed
my
firm
*NL*
belief
that
it
was
his
will
that
it
should
be
so
;
and
then
proceeded
to
*NL*
enquire
,
why
should
God
deal
with
me
in
this
manner
?
Or
what
have
I
done
*NL*
thus
to
deserve
his
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
conscience
flew
in
my
face
,
reprehending
me
as
a
blasphemer
;
crying
*NL*
with
a
loud
and
piercing
voice
,
_
Unworthy
wretch
!
how
dare
you
ask
what
*NL*
you
have
done
?
Look
on
your
past
life
,
and
see
what
you
have
left
*NL*
undone
?
Ask
thyself
,
why
thou
wert
not
long
ago
in
the
merciless
hands
*NL*
of
death
?
Why
not
drowned
in
Yarmouth
roads
,
or
killed
in
the
fight
,
*NL*
when
the
ship
was
taken
by
the
Sallee
man
of
war
?
Why
not
entombed
in
*NL*
the
bowels
of
wild
beasts
on
the
African
coast
,
or
drowned
here
when
all
*NL*
thy
companions
suffered
shipwreck
in
the
ocean
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Struck
dumb
with
these
reflections
,
I
rose
up
in
a
pensive
manner
,
being
*NL*
so
thoughtful
that
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
;
and
fearing
the
dreadful
*NL*
return
of
my
distemper
,
it
caused
me
to
remember
,
that
the
Brazilians
*NL*
use
tobacco
for
almost
all
diseases
.
I
then
went
to
my
chest
in
older
to
*NL*
find
some
,
where
Heaven
,
no
doubt
,
directed
me
to
find
a
cure
for
both
*NL*
soul
and
body
;
for
there
I
found
one
of
the
Bibles
,
which
,
till
this
*NL*
time
,
I
had
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
to
look
into
,
I
took
both
*NL*
the
tobacco
and
that
out
of
the
chest
,
and
laid
them
on
the
table
.
*NL*
Several
experiments
did
I
try
with
the
tobacco
:
First
,
I
took
a
piece
or
*NL*
leaf
,
and
chewed
it
;
but
it
being
very
green
and
strong
,
almost
*NL*
stupified
me
.
Next
I
steeped
it
in
some
rum
an
hour
or
two
,
resolving
*NL*
when
I
went
to
bed
to
take
a
dole
of
it
:
and
,
in
the
third
place
,
I
*NL*
burnt
some
over
a
pan
of
fire
,
holding
my
nose
over
it
as
long
as
I
*NL*
could
endure
it
without
suffocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
intervals
of
this
operation
,
though
my
head
was
giddy
and
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
tobacco
,
I
took
up
the
Bible
to
read
.
No
sooner
did
I
*NL*
open
it
,
but
there
appeared
to
me
these
words
_
Call
on
me
in
the
day
of
*NL*
trouble
,
and
I
will
deliver
thee
,
and
thou
shall
glorify
me
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
this
sentence
made
a
very
deep
impression
on
my
heart
,
but
it
*NL*
soon
wore
off
again
,
when
I
considered
the
word
_
deliver
_
was
foreign
to
*NL*
me
.
And
as
the
children
of
Israel
said
,
when
they
were
promised
flesh
to
*NL*
eat
,
_
Can
God
spread
a
table
in
the
wilderness
?
_
in
like
manner
I
began
*NL*
to
say
,
_
Can
God
himself
deliver
me
from
this
desolate
island
?
_
However
,
*NL*
the
words
would
still
return
to
my
mind
,
and
afterwards
made
a
greater
*NL*
impression
upon
me
.
As
it
was
now
very
late
,
and
the
tobacco
had
dazed
*NL*
my
head
,
I
was
inclined
to
sleep
:
but
before
I
would
lie
down
I
fell
on
*NL*
my
knees
,
and
implored
the
promise
that
God
had
made
to
me
in
the
Holy
*NL*
Scriptures
,
that
_
if
I
called
upon
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
he
would
*NL*
deliver
me
.
_
With
much
difficulty
I
afterwards
drank
the
rum
wherein
I
*NL*
had
steeped
the
tobacco
,
which
flying
into
my
head
,
threw
me
into
such
a
*NL*
profound
sleep
,
that
it
was
three
o'clock
the
next
day
before
I
awaked
;
*NL*
or
rather
,
I
believe
,
I
slept
two
days
,
having
certainly
lost
a
day
in
*NL*
my
account
,
and
I
could
never
tell
any
other
way
.
When
I
got
up
,
my
*NL*
spirits
were
lively
and
cheerful
;
my
stomach
much
better
,
being
very
*NL*
hungry
;
and
,
in
short
,
no
fit
returned
the
next
day
,
which
was
the
29th
,
*NL*
but
I
found
myself
much
altered
for
the
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
30th
,
I
went
abroad
with
my
gun
,
but
not
far
,
and
killed
a
sea-fowl
*NL*
or
two
,
resembling
a
brand
goose
,
which
,
however
,
I
cared
not
to
eat
*NL*
when
I
brought
them
home
,
but
dined
on
two
more
of
the
turtle
's
eggs
.
In
*NL*
the
evening
I
renewed
my
medicine
,
excepting
that
I
did
not
take
so
*NL*
large
a
quantity
,
neither
did
I
chew
the
leaf
,
or
hold
my
head
over
the
*NL*
smoke
:
but
the
next
day
,
which
was
the
1st
of
_
July
_
,
having
a
little
*NL*
return
of
the
cold
fit
,
I
again
took
my
medicine
as
I
did
the
*NL*
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
July
_
3
.
The
fit
quite
left
me
,
but
very
weak
.
In
this
condition
,
I
*NL*
often
thought
of
these
words
,
_
I
will
deliver
thee
_
;
and
while
,
at
some
*NL*
times
,
I
would
think
of
the
impossibility
of
it
,
other
thoughts
would
*NL*
reprehend
me
for
disregarding
the
deliverances
I
had
received
,
even
from
*NL*
the
most
forlorn
and
distressed
condition
.
I
asked
myself
,
what
regard
*NL*
have
I
had
to
God
for
his
abundant
mercies
?
Have
I
done
my
part
_
:
He
has
*NL*
delivered
me
,
but
I
have
not
glorified
him
:
_
--
as
if
I
had
said
,
I
had
*NL*
not
owned
and
been
thankful
for
these
as
deliverances
,
and
how
could
I
*NL*
expect
greater
?
So
much
did
this
sensibly
touch
my
heart
,
that
I
gave
*NL*
God
thanks
for
my
recovery
from
weakness
in
the
most
humble
prostration
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
July
_
4
.
This
morning
I
began
seriously
to
ponder
on
what
is
written
in
*NL*
the
New
Testament
,
resolving
to
read
a
chapter
every
morning
and
night
*NL*
as
long
an
my
thoughts
would
engage
me
.
As
soon
as
I
set
about
this
work
*NL*
seriously
,
I
found
my
heart
deeply
affected
with
the
impiety
of
my
past
*NL*
life
;
these
words
that
I
thought
were
spoken
to
me
in
my
dream
revived
,
*NL*
_
All
these
things
have
not
brought
thee
to
repentance
.
_
After
this
,
I
*NL*
begged
of
God
to
assist
me
with
his
Holy
Spirit
in
returning
to
my
duty
.
*NL*
One
day
in
perusing
the
Scriptures
,
I
came
to
these
words
,
_
He
is
*NL*
exalted
a
Prince
and
a
Saviour
,
to
give
repentance
and
to
give
*NL*
remission
_
:
Immediately
I
laid
down
the
book
,
and
with
uplifted
hands
to
*NL*
Heaven
,
loudly
cried
,
_
O
blessed
Jesus
,
thou
son
of
David
,
Jesus
,
thou
*NL*
exalted
Prince
and
Saviour
,
give
we
repentance
!
_
And
now
indeed
I
prayed
*NL*
with
a
true
sense
of
my
condition
,
and
a
more
certain
hope
,
founded
on
*NL*
the
word
of
God
.
Now
I
had
a
different
sense
of
these
words
,
_
Call
on
me
*NL*
and
I
will
deliver
thee
_
,
that
is
from
the
dreadful
load
of
guilt
which
*NL*
oppressed
my
sinful
soul
,
and
not
from
a
solitary
life
,
which
might
*NL*
rather
be
called
,
a
blessing
,
seeing
I
wanted
neither
food
nor
raiment
,
*NL*
when
compared
living
amongst
the
human
race
,
surrounded
with
so
much
*NL*
oppression
,
misery
,
and
affliction
;
in
a
word
,
I
came
to
this
*NL*
conclusion
,
that
a
deliverance
from
sin
was
a
much
greater
blessing
,
*NL*
than
a
deliverance
from
affliction
.
But
again
I
proceed
to
my
journal
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
14th
of
_
July
_
,
I
walked
about
with
my
gun
,
little
and
little
at
*NL*
a
time
,
having
been
reduced
to
the
greatest
extremity
of
weakness
.
The
*NL*
applications
and
experiments
I
used
were
perfectly
new
:
neither
could
I
*NL*
recommend
them
to
any
one
's
practice
.
For
though
it
carried
off
the
fit
,
*NL*
it
very
much
weakened
me
,
and
I
had
frequently
convulsions
in
my
nerves
*NL*
and
limbs
for
some
time
.
From
this
I
learned
,
that
going
abroad
in
rainy
*NL*
weather
,
especially
when
it
was
attended
with
storms
and
hurricanes
of
*NL*
wind
,
was
most
pernicious
to
health
.
I
had
now
been
about
ten
months
in
*NL*
the
island
;
and
as
I
never
had
seen
any
of
the
human
kind
,
I
therefore
*NL*
accounted
myself
as
sole
monarch
;
and
as
I
grew
better
,
having
secured
*NL*
my
habitation
to
my
mind
,
I
resolved
to
make
a
tour
round
my
kingdom
,
in
*NL*
order
to
make
new
discoveries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
15th
of
_
July
_
,
I
began
my
journey
;
I
first
went
to
the
creek
,
where
*NL*
I
had
brought
my
rafts
on
shore
;
and
travelling
farther
,
found
the
tide
*NL*
went
no
higher
than
two
miles
up
,
where
there
was
a
little
brook
of
*NL*
running
water
,
on
the
banks
of
which
were
many
pleasant
savannahs
or
*NL*
meadows
,
plain
,
smooth
,
and
covered
with
grass
.
On
the
rising
parts
,
*NL*
where
I
supposed
the
water
did
not
reach
,
I
perceived
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
tobacco
growing
to
a
very
strong
stalk
.
Several
other
plants
I
likewise
*NL*
found
,
the
virtues
of
which
I
did
not
understand
.
I
searched
a
long
time
*NL*
for
the
Cassava
root
,
which
I
knew
the
Indians
in
that
climate
made
*NL*
their
bread
of
,
but
all
in
vain
.
There
were
several
plants
of
aloes
,
*NL*
though
at
that
time
I
knew
not
what
they
were
;
likewise
I
saw
several
*NL*
sugar
canes
,
but
imperfect
for
want
of
cultivation
.
With
these
few
*NL*
discoveries
,
I
came
back
that
night
,
and
slept
contentedly
in
my
*NL*
little
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
being
the
16th
,
going
the
same
way
,
but
farther
then
the
*NL*
day
before
,
I
found
the
country
more
adorned
with
woods
and
trees
.
Here
*NL*
I
perceived
different
fruits
in
great
abundance
.
Melons
in
plenty
lay
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
clusters
of
grapes
,
ripe
and
very
rich
,
spread
over
the
*NL*
trees
.
You
may
imagine
I
was
glad
of
this
discovery
,
yet
ate
very
*NL*
sparingly
,
lest
I
should
throw
myself
into
a
flux
or
fever
.
The
grapes
I
*NL*
found
of
excellent
use
;
for
when
I
had
dried
them
in
the
sun
,
which
*NL*
preserved
them
as
dried
raisins
are
kept
,
they
proved
very
wholesome
and
*NL*
nourishing
,
and
served
me
in
those
seasons
when
no
grapes
were
to
*NL*
be
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
drawing
on
apace
,
I
ascended
up
a
tree
,
and
slept
very
*NL*
comfortably
,
though
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
lain
out
of
my
*NL*
habitation
.
And
when
the
morning
came
,
I
proceeded
with
great
pleasure
*NL*
on
my
way
,
travelling
about
four
miles
,
as
I
imagined
,
by
the
length
of
*NL*
the
valley
,
directing
my
course
northward
,
there
being
a
ridge
of
hills
*NL*
on
the
south
and
north
side
of
me
.
At
the
end
of
this
valley
,
I
came
to
*NL*
an
opening
,
where
the
country
seemed
to
descend
to
the
west
;
there
I
*NL*
found
a
little
spring
of
fresh
water
,
proceeding
out
of
the
side
of
the
*NL*
hill
,
with
its
chrystal
streams
running
directly
east
.
And
,
indeed
,
here
*NL*
my
senses
were
charmed
with
the
most
beautiful
landscape
nature
could
*NL*
afford
;
for
the
country
appeared
flourishing
,
green
,
and
delightful
,
*NL*
that
to
me
it
seemed
like
a
planted
garden
.
I
then
descended
on
the
side
*NL*
of
that
delicious
vale
,
when
I
found
abundance
of
cocoa
,
orange
,
lemon
,
*NL*
and
citron
trees
,
but
very
wild
and
barren
at
that
time
.
As
for
the
*NL*
limes
,
they
were
delightful
and
wholesome
,
the
juice
of
which
I
after
*NL*
used
to
mix
in
water
,
which
made
it
very
cooling
and
refreshing
.
And
now
*NL*
I
was
resolved
to
carry
home
and
lay
up
a
store
of
grapes
,
limes
,
and
*NL*
lemons
,
against
the
approaching
wet
season
.
So
laying
them
up
in
*NL*
separate
parcels
,
and
then
taking
a
few
of
each
with
me
,
I
returned
to
*NL*
my
little
castle
,
after
having
spent
three
days
in
this
journey
.
Before
*NL*
I
got
home
,
the
grapes
were
so
bruised
that
they
were
utterly
spoiled
;
*NL*
the
limes
indeed
were
good
,
but
of
those
I
could
bring
only
a
few
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
July
19
_
.
Having
prepared
two
bags
,
I
returned
thither
again
,
but
,
to
*NL*
my
great
surprise
,
found
all
the
grapes
spread
about
,
trod
to
pieces
,
*NL*
and
abundance
eaten
,
which
made
me
conclude
there
were
wild
beasts
*NL*
thereabouts
.
To
prevent
this
happening
again
,
I
gathered
a
large
*NL*
quantity
of
the
grapes
,
and
hung
them
upon
the
out
branches
of
the
tree
,
*NL*
both
to
keep
them
unhurt
,
and
that
they
might
cure
and
dry
in
the
sun
;
*NL*
and
having
well
loaded
myself
with
limes
and
lemons
,
I
returned
once
*NL*
more
to
my
old
place
of
residence
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
contemplating
on
the
fruitfulness
of
this
valey
,
and
*NL*
pleasantness
of
its
situation
,
its
security
from
storms
,
and
the
*NL*
delightfulness
of
the
adjacent
woods
,
I
concluded
I
was
settled
in
the
*NL*
worst
part
of
the
country
,
and
therefore
was
thinking
to
remove
my
*NL*
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
considered
again
,
that
though
it
was
pleasant
,
it
was
off
*NL*
from
the
sea-side
,
where
there
was
a
possibility
,
some
time
or
other
,
a
*NL*
ship
might
either
be
driven
or
sail
by
;
and
that
to
inclose
myself
among
*NL*
hills
and
woods
must
certainly
put
an
end
to
my
hopes
of
deliverance
;
I
*NL*
resolved
to
let
my
castle
remain
where
Providence
had
first
assigned
it
.
*NL*
Yet
so
ravished
was
I
with
this
place
,
that
I
made
me
a
little
kind
of
*NL*
bower
,
surrounding
it
with
a
double
hedge
,
as
high
as
I
could
reach
,
*NL*
well
staked
and
filled
with
bullrushes
:
and
having
spent
a
great
part
of
*NL*
the
month
of
_
July
_
,
I
think
it
was
the
first
of
_
August
_
before
I
began
*NL*
to
enjoy
my
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Aug.

.
_
Perceiving
my
grapes
to
be
dry
,
I
took
them
from
the
trees
,
*NL*
and
they
proved
excellent
good
raisins
of
the
sun
:
the
most
of
which
I
*NL*
carried
to
my
cave
;
and
happy
for
me
I
did
so
;
by
which
I
saved
the
best
*NL*
part
of
my
winter
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Aug
_
.
14
.
This
day
it
began
to
rain
;
and
though
I
had
made
me
a
tent
*NL*
like
the
other
,
yet
having
no
shelter
of
a
hill
to
keep
me
from
storms
,
*NL*
nor
a
cave
behind
me
to
retreat
to
,
I
was
obliged
to
return
to
my
old
*NL*
castle
.
The
rain
continued
more
or
less
every
day
,
till
the
middle
of
*NL*
_
October
;
_
and
sometimes
so
violently
,
that
I
could
not
stir
out
of
my
*NL*
cave
for
several
days
.
This
season
I
found
my
family
to
increase
;
for
*NL*
one
of
my
cats
that
ran
away
from
me
,
and
which
I
thought
had
been
dead
,
*NL*
returned
about
_
August
_
,
with
three
kittens
at
her
heels
,
like
herself
,
*NL*
which
I
thought
strange
,
because
both
my
cats
were
females
,
and
the
wild
*NL*
cats
of
the
island
seemed
to
be
of
a
different
kind
from
our
European
*NL*
cats
;
but
from
these
cats
proceeded
such
numbers
,
that
I
was
forced
to
*NL*
kill
and
destroy
them
as
I
would
do
wild
beasts
and
vermin
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
26th
of
this
month
,
I
could
not
stir
out
,
it
raining
incessantly
;
*NL*
when
beginning
to
want
food
,
I
was
compelled
to
venture
twice
,
the
first
*NL*
of
which
I
shot
a
goat
,
and
afterwards
found
a
very
large
tortoise
.
The
*NL*
manner
of
my
regulating
my
food
was
thus
:
a
bunch
of
raisins
served
me
*NL*
for
my
breakfast
;
a
piece
of
goat
's
flesh
or
turtle
boiled
for
my
*NL*
dinner
,
and
two
or
three
turtle
's
eggs
for
my
supper
.
While
the
rain
*NL*
lasted
,
I
daily
worked
two
or
three
hours
at
enlarging
my
cave
,
and
by
*NL*
degrees
worked
it
on
towards
one
side
,
till
I
came
to
the
outside
of
the
*NL*
hill
,
and
made
a
door
or
way
out
,
which
came
beyond
my
fence
or
wall
,
*NL*
and
so
I
came
in
and
out
this
way
.
But
after
I
had
done
this
,
I
was
*NL*
troubled
to
see
myself
thus
exposed
;
though
I
could
not
perceive
any
*NL*
thing
to
fear
,
a
goat
being
the
biggest
creature
I
had
seen
upon
*NL*
this
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Sept
_
.
30
.
Casting
up
my
notches
on
my
post
,
which
amounted
to
365
,
I
*NL*
concluded
this
to
be
the
anniversary
of
my
landing
;
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
humbly
prostrating
myself
on
the
ground
,
confessing
my
sins
,
*NL*
acknowledging
God
's
righteous
judgments
upon
me
,
and
praying
to
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
to
have
mercy
upon
me
,
I
fasted
for
twelve
hours
till
the
going
*NL*
down
of
the
sun
;
and
then
eating
a
biscuit
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
,
laid
*NL*
me
on
the
bed
,
and
with
great
comfort
took
my
night
's
repose
.
Till
this
*NL*
time
I
never
had
distinguished
the
Sabbath-day
;
but
now
made
a
longer
*NL*
notch
than
ordinary
for
the
days
of
rest
,
and
divided
the
weeks
as
well
*NL*
as
I
could
,
though
I
found
I
had
lost
a
day
or
two
in
my
account
.
My
ink
*NL*
failing
soon
after
,
I
omitted
in
my
daily
memorandum
things
of
an
*NL*
indifferent
nature
,
&
contented
myself
to
write
down
only
the
most
*NL*
remarkable
events
of
my
life
.
The
rainy
and
dry
seasons
appeared
now
*NL*
regular
to
me
,
and
experience
taught
me
how
to
provide
for
them
;
yet
,
in
*NL*
one
thing
I
am
going
to
relate
,
my
experience
very
much
failed
me
.
You
*NL*
may
call
to
mind
what
I
have
mentioned
of
some
barley
and
rice
which
I
*NL*
had
saved
;
about
thirty
stalks
of
the
former
,
and
twenty
of
the
latter
;
*NL*
and
at
that
time
,
the
sun
being
in
its
southern
position
,
going
from
*NL*
me
,
together
with
the
rains
,
made
me
conclude
it
a
very
proper
season
to
*NL*
sow
it
.
Accordingly
I
dug
up
a
piece
of
ground
,
with
my
wooden
spade
,
*NL*
and
dividing
it
into
two
parts
,
sowed
about
two
thirds
of
my
seed
,
*NL*
preserving
by
me
about
a
handful
of
each
.
And
happy
it
was
I
did
so
;
for
*NL*
no
rains
falling
,
it
was
choaked
up
,
and
never
appeared
above
the
earth
*NL*
till
the
wet
season
came
again
,
and
then
part
of
it
grew
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
newly
sown
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
resolved
all
to
make
another
trial
;
and
seeking
for
a
moister
*NL*
piece
of
ground
near
my
bower
,
I
there
sowed
the
rest
of
my
seed
in
*NL*
February
,
a
little
before
the
vernal
equinox
;
which
having
the
rainy
*NL*
months
of
March
and
April
to
water
it
,
yielded
a
noble
crop
,
and
sprang
*NL*
up
very
pleasantly
.
I
had
still
saved
part
of
the
seed
,
not
daring
to
*NL*
venture
all
;
and
by
the
time
I
found
out
the
proper
seasons
to
sow
it
*NL*
in
,
and
that
I
might
expect
every
year
two
seed-times
and
two
harvests
,
*NL*
my
stock
amounted
to
above
half
a
peck
of
each
sort
of
grain
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
were
the
rains
over
,
but
the
stakes
which
I
had
cut
from
the
*NL*
trees
,
shot
out
like
willows
the
first
year
after
lopping
their
heads
.
I
*NL*
was
ignorant
of
the
tree
I
cut
them
from
;
but
they
grew
so
regularly
*NL*
beautiful
,
that
they
made
a
most
lively
appearance
,
and
so
flourished
in
*NL*
three
year
's
time
,
that
I
resolved
to
cut
more
of
them
;
and
these
soon
*NL*
growing
made
a
glorious
fence
,
as
afterwards
I
shall
observe
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
perceived
that
the
seasons
of
the
year
might
generally
be
*NL*
divided
,
not
into
summer
and
winter
,
as
in
Europe
,
but
into
wet
and
dry
*NL*
seasons
,
as
in
this
manner
:

*NL*
*NL*
The
wet
seasons
would
continue
longer
or
shorter
,
as
the
winds
happened
*NL*
to
blow
.
But
having
found
the
ill
consequences
of
being
abroad
in
the
*NL*
rain
,
I
took
care
beforehand
to
furnish
myself
with
provisions
;
and
*NL*
during
the
wet
months
sat
within
doors
as
much
as
possible
.
At
this
time
*NL*
I
contrived
to
make
many
things
that
I
wanted
,
though
it
cost
me
much
*NL*
labour
and
pains
,
before
I
could
accomplish
them
.
The
first
I
tried
was
*NL*
to
make
a
basket
;
but
all
the
twigs
I
could
get
proved
so
brittle
,
that
*NL*
I
could
not
then
perform
it
.
It
now
proved
of
great
advantage
to
me
that
*NL*
when
a
boy
,
I
took
great
delight
in
standing
at
a
basket-maker
's
in
the
*NL*
same
town
where
my
father
lived
,
to
view
them
at
work
;
and
like
other
*NL*
boys
,
curious
to
see
the
manner
of
their
working
these
things
and
very
*NL*
officious
to
assist
,
I
perfectly
learned
the
method
of
it
,
and
wanted
*NL*
nothing
but
the
tools
.
And
it
coming
into
my
mind
that
the
twigs
of
that
*NL*
tree
of
which
I
made
my
stakes
,
might
be
as
tough
as
a
fallow
willow
,
or
*NL*
osiers
,
growing
in
England
,
I
resolved
to
make
an
experiment
,
and
went
*NL*
the
next
day
to
my
country-seat
,
and
found
some
fit
for
my
turn
;
and
*NL*
after
cutting
down
a
quantity
with
my
hatchet
,
I
dried
them
in
my
pale
,
*NL*
and
,
when
fit
to
work
with
,
carried
them
to
my
cave
,
where
I
employed
*NL*
myself
in
making
several
sorts
of
baskets
,
insomuch
that
I
could
put
in
*NL*
whatsoever
I
pleased
.
It
is
true
,
they
were
not
cleverly
made
,
yet
they
*NL*
served
my
turn
upon
all
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
still
I
wanted
two
necessary
things
.
I
had
no
cask
to
hold
my
*NL*
liquor
,
except
two
rundlets
almost
full
of
rum
,
a
few
bottles
of
an
*NL*
ordinary
size
,
and
some
square
case
bottles
,
neither
had
I
a
pot
to
boil
*NL*
any
thing
in
,
only
a
large
kettle
unfit
to
make
broth
,
or
stew
a
bit
of
*NL*
meat
:
I
wanted
,
likewise
at
the
beginning
of
this
dry
season
a
tobacco
*NL*
pipe
;
but
for
this
I
afterwards
found
an
expedient
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
myself
employed
in
planting
my
second
row
of
stakes
,
But
*NL*
remembering
that
when
I
travelled
up
to
the
brook
,
I
had
a
mind
to
see
*NL*
the
whole
island
,
I
now
resumed
my
intention
,
and
taking
my
dog
,
gun
,
*NL*
hatchet
,
two
biscuit
cakes
,
a
great
bunch
of
raisins
,
with
a
larger
*NL*
quantity
of
powder
and
shot
than
usual
,
I
began
my
journey
.
Having
*NL*
passed
the
vale
where
my
bower
stood
,
I
came
within
view
of
the
sea
*NL*
lying
to
the
west
when
it
being
a
clear
day
,
I
fairly
descried
land
,
*NL*
extending
from
the
W.
to
the
S.W.
about
ten
or
fifteen
leagues
,
as
I
*NL*
concluded
;
but
could
not
say
whether
it
was
an
island
or
a
*NL*
continent
.
--
Neither
could
I
tell
what
this
place
might
be
;
only
thought
*NL*
it
was
part
of
America
,
&
where
I
might
have
been
in
a
miserable
*NL*
condition
,
had
I
landed
.
Again
I
considered
that
if
this
was
the
Spanish
*NL*
coast
,
certainly
,
one
time
or
other
,
I
should
see
some
ship
pass
by
;
and
*NL*
if
it
was
not
,
then
it
must
be
the
savage
coast
,
between
the
Spanish
*NL*
country
and
Brazil
,
which
abounds
with
cannibals
or
man-eaters
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
proceeded
forward
I
found
this
side
of
the
island
much
more
*NL*
pleasant
than
mine
;
the
fields
fragrant
adorned
with
sweet
flowers
&
*NL*
verdant
grass
,
together
with
several
very
,
fine
woods
.
There
were
*NL*
parrots
in
plenty
,
which
made
me
long
for
one
to
be
my
companion
;
but
*NL*
it
was
with
great
difficulty
I
could
knock
one
down
with
my
stick
;
and
I
*NL*
kept
him
at
home
some
years
before
I
could
get
him
to
call
me
by
*NL*
my
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
low
grounds
,
I
found
various
sorts
of
hares
and
foxes
,
as
I
took
*NL*
them
to
be
,
but
much
different
from
those
in
England
.
Several
of
these
I
*NL*
killed
,
but
never
ate
them
;
neither
indeed
had
I
any
occasion
;
for
*NL*
abounding
with
goats
,
pigeons
,
turtle
,
and
grapes
,
I
could
defy
*NL*
Leadenhall
market
to
furnish
me
a
better
table
.
In
this
journey
I
did
*NL*
not
travel
above
two
miles
a-day
,
because
I
took
several
turns
and
*NL*
windings
,
to
see
what
discoveries
I
could
make
,
returning
weary
enough
*NL*
to
the
place
where
I
designed
to
rest
all
night
,
which
was
either
in
a
*NL*
tree
,
or
in
a
place
which
I
surrounded
with
stakes
,
that
no
wild
*NL*
creature
might
suddenly
surprise
me
.
When
I
came
to
the
sea
shore
,
I
was
*NL*
amazed
to
see
the
splendour
of
it
.
Its
strand
was
covered
with
shells
of
*NL*
the
most
beautiful
fish
,
and
constantly
abounding
with
innumerable
*NL*
turtles
,
and
fowls
of
many
kinds
,
which
I
was
ignorant
of
,
except
those
*NL*
called
penguins
.
I
might
have
shot
as
many
as
I
pleased
,
but
was
sparing
*NL*
of
my
ammunition
,
rather
choosing
to
kill
a
she-goat
,
which
I
did
with
*NL*
much
difficulty
,
on
account
of
the
flatness
of
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
though
this
journey
produced
me
the
most
pleasing
satisfaction
,
yet
*NL*
my
habitation
was
so
much
to
my
liking
,
that
I
did
not
repine
at
my
*NL*
being
seated
on
the
worst
part
of
the
island
.
I
continued
my
journey
,
*NL*
travelling
about
twelve
miles
further
towards
the
east
,
where
I
set
a
*NL*
great
pile
on
the
shore
for
a
mark
,
concluding
that
my
next
journey
*NL*
should
bring
me
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
east
from
my
castle
,
*NL*
and
so
round
till
I
came
to
my
post
again
.
As
I
had
a
constant
view
of
*NL*
the
country
,
I
thought
I
could
not
miss
my
way
;
but
scarce
had
I
*NL*
travelled
three
miles
,
when
I
descended
into
a
very
large
valley
,
so
*NL*
surrounded
with
hills
covered
with
wood
,
that
I
having
no
guide
but
the
*NL*
sun
,
nor
even
this
,
unless
I
knew
will
the
position
of
the
sun
at
the
*NL*
time
of
day
;
and
to
add
to
my
misfortune
,
the
weather
proving
very
hazy
,
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
return
to
my
post
by
the
sea-side
,
and
so
backwards
the
*NL*
same
way
I
came
.
In
this
journey
my
dog
surprised
a
kid
and
would
have
*NL*
killed
it
,
had
I
not
prevented
him
.
As
I
had
often
been
thinking
of
*NL*
getting
a
kid
or
two
,
and
so
raising
a
breed
of
tame
goats
to
supply
me
*NL*
after
my
ammunition
was
spent
,
I
took
this
opportunity
of
beginning
:
and
*NL*
having
made
a
collar
for
this
little
creature
,
with
a
string
made
of
*NL*
rope-yarn
,
I
brought
it
to
my
bower
,
and
there
inclosed
and
left
him
;
*NL*
and
,
having
spent
a
month
in
this
journey
,
at
length
I
returned
to
my
*NL*
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
can
doubt
of
my
satisfaction
,
when
I
returned
to
my
little
*NL*
castle
,
and
reposed
myself
in
my
hammock
.
After
my
journey
I
rested
*NL*
myself
a
week
,
which
time
I
employed
in
,
making
a
cage
for
my
pretty
*NL*
Poll
.
I
now
began
to
consider
the
poor
kid
I
had
left
in
the
bower
,
and
*NL*
I
immediately
went
to
fetch
it
home
.
When
I
came
there
I
found
the
young
*NL*
creature
almost
starved
;
I
gave
it
some
food
,
and
tied
it
as
before
:
but
*NL*
there
was
no
occasion
,
for
it
followed
me
like
a
dog
;
and
,
as
I
*NL*
constantly
fed
it
,
it
became
so
loving
,
gentle
,
and
fond
,
that
it
*NL*
commenced
one
of
my
domestics
,
and
would
never
leave
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainy
season
of
the
autumnal
equinox
being
now
come
,
I
kept
the
30th
*NL*
of
September
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
as
usual
,
it
being
the
third
*NL*
year
of
my
abode
in
the
island
.
I
spent
the
whole
day
in
acknowledging
*NL*
God
's
mercies
,
in
giving
him
thanks
for
making
this
solitary
life
as
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
less
sinful
,
than
that
of
human
society
;
and
for
the
*NL*
communications
of
his
grace
to
my
soul
,
in
supporting
,
comforting
,
and
*NL*
encouraging
me
to
depend
,
upon
his
Providence
,
and
hope
for
his
eternal
*NL*
presence
in
the
world
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
often
did
consider
how
much
more
happy
I
was
in
this
fate
of
*NL*
life
,
than
in
that
accursed
manner
of
living
formerly
used
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
when
hunting
,
or
viewing
the
country
,
the
anguish
of
my
soul
*NL*
would
break
out
upon
me
,
and
my
very
heart
would
sink
within
me
,
to
*NL*
think
of
the
woods
,
the
mountains
,
the
desarts
I
was
in
;
and
how
I
was
a
*NL*
prisoner
locked
up
within
the
eternal
bars
and
bolts
of
the
ocean
,
in
an
*NL*
uninhabited
wilderness
,
without
hopes
,
and
without
redemption
:
In
this
*NL*
condition
I
would
often
wring
my
hands
,
and
weep
like
a
child
:
And
even
*NL*
sometimes
,
in
the
middle
of
my
work
,
this
fit
would
take
me
;
and
then
I
*NL*
would
sit
down
and
sigh
,
looking
on
the
ground
for
an
hour
or
two
*NL*
together
,
till
such
time
as
my
grief
got
vent
in
a
flood
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
as
I
was
sadly
employed
in
this
manner
,
I
opened
my
Bible
,
*NL*
when
I
immediately
fixed
my
eyes
upon
these
words
,
_
I
will
never
leave
*NL*
thee
,
nor
forsake
thee
!
_
Surely
,
thought
I
,
these
words
are
directed
to
*NL*
me
,
or
else
why
should
they
appear
just
at
a
moment
when
I
am
bemoaning
*NL*
my
forlorn
condition
?
and
if
God
does
not
forsake
,
what
matters
it
,
*NL*
since
he
can
me
more
happy
in
this
state
of
life
,
than
if
I
enjoyed
the
*NL*
greatest
splendour
in
the
world
?
But
while
I
was
going
to
return
God
*NL*
thanks
for
my
present
state
,
something
seemed
to
shock
my
mind
,
as
if
it
*NL*
had
thus
said
:
_
Unworthy
wretch
;
can
you
pretend
to
be
thankful
for
a
*NL*
condition
,
from
which
you
would
pray
to
be
delivered
_
?
Therefore
I
*NL*
stopt
:
--
and
tho
'
I
could
not
say
,
I
thanked
the
Divine
Majesty
for
*NL*
being
there
,
yet
I
gave
God
thanks
for
placing
in
my
view
my
former
*NL*
course
of
life
,
and
granting
me
a
true
knowledge
of
repentance
.
And
*NL*
whenever
I
opened
or
read
the
Bible
,
I
blessed
kind
Providence
,
that
*NL*
directed
my
good
friend
in
England
to
send
it
among
my
goods
without
*NL*
any
order
,
and
for
assisting
me
to
save
it
from
the
power
of
the
*NL*
raging
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
beginning
my
third
year
,
my
several
daily
employments
were
*NL*
these
:
_
First
_
,
My
duty
to
Heaven
,
and
diligently
reading
the
Holy
*NL*
Scriptures
,
which
I
did
twice
or
thrice
every
day
:
_
Secondly
_
,
Seeking
*NL*
provision
with
my
gun
,
which
commonly
took
me
up
,
when
it
did
not
rain
,
*NL*
three
hours
every
morning
:
_
Thirdly
_
,
The
ordering
,
curing
,
preserving
,
*NL*
and
cooking
what
I
killed
,
or
catched
for
my
supply
which
took
me
up
*NL*
great
part
of
the
day
:
for
,
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
the
sun
being
in
*NL*
its
height
,
it
was
so
hot
,
that
I
could
not
stir
out
;
so
that
I
had
only
*NL*
but
four
hours
in
the
evening
to
work
in
:
and
then
the
want
of
tools
,
of
*NL*
assistance
,
and
skill
,
wasted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
little
purpose
.
I
*NL*
was
no
less
than
two
and
forty
days
making
a
board
fit
for
a
long
shelf
,
*NL*
which
two
sawyers
with
their
tools
and
saw-pit
,
would
have
cut
off
the
*NL*
same
tree
in
half
a
day
.
It
was
a
large
tree
,
as
my
board
was
to
be
*NL*
broad
.
I
was
three
days
in
cutting
it
down
and
two
more
in
lopping
off
*NL*
the
boughs
,
and
reducing
it
to
a
piece
of
timber
.
This
I
hacked
and
*NL*
hewed
off
each
side
,
till
it
became
light
to
move
;
then
I
turned
it
,
*NL*
made
one
side
of
is
smooth
and
flat
as
a
board
from
end
to
end
,
then
*NL*
turned
it
downward
,
cutting
the
other
side
,
till
I
brouht
the
plank
to
*NL*
be
about
three
inches
thick
,
and
smooth
on
both
sides
.
Any
body
may
*NL*
judge
my
great
labour
and
fatigue
in
such
a
piece
of
work
;
but
this
I
*NL*
went
through
with
patience
,
as
also
many
other
things
that
my
*NL*
circumstances
made
necessary
for
me
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
harvest
months
,
November
and
December
,
were
now
at
hand
,
in
which
I
*NL*
had
the
pleasing
prospect
of
a
very
good
crop
.
But
here
I
met
with
a
new
*NL*
problem
;
for
the
goats
and
hares
,
having
tasted
of
the
outshoot
of
the
*NL*
blade
,
kept
it
to
short
that
it
had
not
strengthen
to
shoot
up
into
a
*NL*
stalk
.
To
prevent
this
,
I
enclosed
it
with
a
hedge
,
and
by
day
shot
some
*NL*
of
its
devourers
;
and
my
dog
which
I
had
tied
to
the
field-gate
,
keeping
*NL*
barking
all
night
;
so
frightened
those
creatures
,
that
I
got
entirely
*NL*
rid
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
sooner
did
I
get
rid
of
these
,
than
other
enemies
appeared
,
to
*NL*
wit
,
whole
flocks
of
several
sorts
of
birds
,
who
only
waited
till
my
*NL*
back
was
turned
,
to
ruin
me
:
so
much
did
this
provoke
me
,
that
I
let
*NL*
fly
,
and
killed
three
of
the
malefactors
;
and
afterwards
served
them
as
*NL*
they
do
notorious
thieves
in
England
,
hung
them
up
in
chains
as
a
terror
*NL*
to
others
.
And
,
indeed
,
to
good
an
effect
had
this
that
they
not
only
*NL*
forsook
the
corn
,
but
all
that
part
of
the
island
,
so
long
as
these
*NL*
criminals
hung
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
corn
having
ripened
apace
,
the
latter
end
of
December
,
which
was
my
*NL*
second
harvest
,
I
reaped
it
with
a
scythe
,
made
of
one
of
my
broad
*NL*
swords
.
I
had
no
fatigue
in
cutting
down
my
my
first
crop
it
was
so
*NL*
slender
.
The
ears
I
carried
home
in
a
basket
,
rubbing
it
with
my
hands
,
*NL*
instead
of
threshing
it
:
and
when
the
harvest
was
over
,
found
my
half
*NL*
peck
of
seed
produced
near
two
bushels
of
rice
,
and
two
bushels
and
a
*NL*
half
of
barley
.
And
now
I
plainly
foresaw
,
that
by
God
's
goodness
,
I
*NL*
should
be
furnished
with
bread
;
but
yet
I
was
concerned
,
because
I
knew
*NL*
not
how
to
grind
or
make
meal
of
my
corn
,
nor
bread
,
neither
knew
how
to
*NL*
bake
it
.
I
would
not
however
,
taste
any
of
the
crop
,
but
resolved
to
*NL*
preserve
it
against
next
season
,
and
,
in
the
mean
while
,
use
my
best
*NL*
endeavours
to
provide
myself
with
other
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
where
were
my
labours
to
end
?
The
want
of
a
plough
to
turn
up
the
*NL*
earth
,
or
shovel
to
dig
it
,
I
conquered
by
making
me
a
wooden
spade
.
The
*NL*
want
of
a
harrow
I
supplied
myself
,
with
dragging
over
the
corn
a
great
*NL*
bough
of
a
tree
.
When
it
was
growing
I
was
forced
to
fence
it
;
when
ripe
*NL*
to
mow
it
,
carry
it
home
,
thrash
it
,
part
it
from
the
chaff
,
and
save
*NL*
it
.
And
,
after
all
,
I
wanted
a
mill
to
grind
it
,
sieve
to
dress
it
,
yest
*NL*
and
salt
to
make
it
into
bread
,
and
an
oven
to
bake
it
.
This
set
my
*NL*
brains
to
work
to
find
some
expedient
for
every
one
of
these
necessaries
*NL*
against
the
next
harvest
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
having
more
seed
,
my
first
care
was
to
prepare
me
more
land
.
I
*NL*
pitched
upon
two
large
flat
pieces
of
ground
near
my
castle
,
for
that
*NL*
purpose
,
in
which
sowed
my
seed
,
and
fenced
it
with
a
good
hedge
.
This
*NL*
took
me
up
three
months
:
by
which
time
the
wet
season
coming
on
,
and
the
*NL*
rain
keeping
me
within
doors
,
I
found
several
occasions
to
employ
*NL*
myself
;
and
,
while
at
work
,
used
to
divert
myself
in
talking
to
my
*NL*
parrot
,
learning
him
to
know
and
speak
his
own
name
_
Poll
_
the
first
*NL*
welcome
word
I
ever
heard
spoke
in
the
island
.
I
had
been
a
long
time
in
*NL*
contriving
how
to
make
earthen
vessels
,
which
I
wanted
extremely
;
and
*NL*
when
I
considered
the
heat
of
the
climate
,
I
did
not
doubt
but
if
I
*NL*
could
find
any
such
clay
,
I
might
botch
up
a
pot
,
strong
enough
,
when
*NL*
dried
in
the
sun
,
to
bear
handling
,
and
to
hold
any
thing
that
was
dry
,
*NL*
as
corn
,
meal
,
and
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
short
,
the
clay
I
found
;
but
it
would
occasion
the
most
serious
*NL*
person
to
smile
,
to
see
what
aukward
ways
I
took
,
and
what
ugly
*NL*
misshapen
things
I
made
;
how
many
either
fell
out
or
cracked
by
the
*NL*
violent
heat
of
the
sun
,
and
fell
in
pieces
when
they
were
removed
;
so
*NL*
that
I
think
it
was
two
months
time
before
I
could
perfect
any
thing
:
*NL*
and
even
then
but
two
clumsy
things
in
imitation
of
earthen
jars
.
These
,
*NL*
however
,
I
very
gently
placed
in
wicker
baskets
,
made
on
purpose
for
*NL*
them
,
and
between
the
pot
and
the
baskets
,
stuffed
it
full
of
rice
and
*NL*
barley
straw
,
and
these
I
presume
would
hold
my
dried
corn
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
the
meal
when
the
corn
was
bruised
.
As
for
the
smaller
thing
,
I
made
*NL*
them
with
better
success
,
such
as
little
round
pots
,
flat
dishes
,
*NL*
pitchers
,
and
pipkins
,
the
fun
baking
them
very
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
still
I
wanted
one
thing
absolutely
necessary
,
and
that
was
an
*NL*
earthen
pot
,
not
only
to
hold
my
liquid
,
but
also
to
bear
the
fire
,
*NL*
which
none
of
these
could
do
.
It
once
happened
that
as
I
was
putting
out
*NL*
my
fire
,
I
found
therein
a
broken
piece
of
one
of
my
vessels
burnt
as
*NL*
hard
as
a
rock
,
and
red
as
a
tile
.
This
made
me
think
of
burning
some
*NL*
pots
;
and
having
no
notion
of
a
kiln
,
or
of
glazing
them
with
leaf
,
I
*NL*
fixed
three
large
pipkins
,
and
two
or
three
pots
in
a
pile
one
upon
*NL*
another
.
The
fire
I
piled
round
the
outside
,
and
dry
wood
on
the
top
,
*NL*
till
I
saw
the
pots
in
the
inside
red
hot
,
and
found
out
that
,
they
were
*NL*
net
crackt
at
all
:
and
when
I
perceived
them
perfectly
red
,
I
let
one
of
*NL*
them
stand
in
the
fire
about
five
or
six
hours
,
till
the
clay
melted
by
*NL*
the
extremity
of
the
heat
,
and
would
have
run
to
glass
,
had
I
suffered
*NL*
it
;
upon
which
I
slacked
my
fire
by
degrees
,
till
the
redness
abated
;
*NL*
and
watching
them
till
the
morning
,
I
found
I
had
three
very
good
*NL*
pipkins
,
and
two
earthen
pots
,
as
well
burnt
and
fit
for
my
turn
as
I
*NL*
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
joy
could
be
greater
than
mine
at
this
discovery
.
For
after
this
,
I
*NL*
may
say
,
I
wanted
for
no
fort
of
earthen
ware
.
I
filled
one
of
my
*NL*
pipkins
with
water
to
boil
me
some
meat
,
which
it
did
admirably
well
,
*NL*
and
with
a
piece
of
kid
I
made
me
some
good
broth
,
as
well
as
my
*NL*
circumstances
would
afford
me
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
concern
I
had
was
to
get
me
a
stone-morter
to
beat
some
corn
*NL*
in
,
instead
of
a
mill
to
grind
it
.
Here
indeed
I
was
at
a
great
loss
,
as
*NL*
not
being
fit
for
a
stone-cutter
;
and
many
days
I
spent
to
find
out
a
*NL*
great
stone
big
enough
to
cut
hollow
and
make
fit
for
a
morter
,
and
*NL*
strong
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
pestil
,
and
that
would
break
the
*NL*
corn
without
filling
it
with
sand
.
But
all
the
stones
of
the
island
*NL*
being
of
a
mouldering
nature
,
rendered
my
search
fruitless
;
and
then
I
*NL*
resolved
to
look
out
for
a
great
block
of
hard
wood
,
which
having
found
,
*NL*
I
formed
it
with
my
ax
and
hammer
,
and
then
,
with
infinite
labour
,
made
*NL*
a
hollow
in
it
,
just
as
the
Indians
of
Brazil
make
their
canoes
.
When
I
*NL*
had
finished
this
,
I
made
a
great
pestil
of
iron
wood
,
and
then
laid
*NL*
them
up
against
my
succeeding
harvest
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
business
was
to
make
me
a
sieve
,
to
sift
my
meal
and
part
it
*NL*
from
the
bran
and
husk
.
Having
no
fine
thin
canvas
to
search
the
meal
*NL*
through
,
I
could
not
tell
what
to
do
.
What
linen
I
had
was
reduced
to
*NL*
rags
:
I
had
goat
's
hair
,
enough
,
but
neither
tools
to
work
it
,
nor
did
I
*NL*
know
how
to
spin
it
:
At
length
I
remembered
I
had
some
neckcloths
of
*NL*
calico
or
muslin
of
the
sailors
,
which
I
had
brought
out
of
the
ship
,
*NL*
and
with
these
I
made
three
small
sieves
proper
enough
for
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
come
now
to
consider
the
baking
part
.
The
want
of
an
oven
I
supplied
*NL*
by
making
some
earthen
pans
very
broad
but
not
deep
.
When
I
had
a
mind
*NL*
to
bake
,
I
made
a
great
fire
upon
the
hearth
,
the
tiles
of
which
I
had
*NL*
made
myself
;
and
when
the
wood
was
burnt
into
live
coals
,
I
spread
them
*NL*
over
it
,
till
it
became
very
hot
;
then
sweeping
them
away
,
I
set
down
my
*NL*
loaves
,
and
whelming
down
the
earthen
pots
upon
them
,
drew
the
ashes
and
*NL*
coals
all
around
the
outsides
of
the
pots
to
continue
the
heat
;
and
in
*NL*
this
manner
I
baked
my
barley
loaves
,
as
well
as
if
I
had
been
a
*NL*
complete
pastry-cook
,
and
also
made
of
the
rice
several
cakes
*NL*
and
puddings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
wonder
that
these
things
took
me
up
the
best
part
of
a
year
,
*NL*
since
what
intermediate
time
I
had
was
bestowed
in
managing
my
new
*NL*
harvest
and
husbandry
;
for
in
the
proper
season
I
reaped
my
corn
,
*NL*
carried
it
home
,
and
laid
it
up
in
the
ear
in
my
large
baskets
,
til
I
*NL*
had
time
to
rub
,
instead
of
thrashing
it
.
And
now
,
indeed
,
my
corn
*NL*
increased
so
much
,
that
it
produced
me
twenty
bushels
of
barley
,
and
as
*NL*
much
rice
,
that
I
not
only
began
to
use
it
freely
,
but
was
thinking
how
*NL*
to
enlarge
my
barns
,
and
resolved
to
sow
as
much
at
a
time
as
would
be
*NL*
sufficient
for
me
for
a
whole
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
,
the
prospect
of
land
,
which
I
had
seen
from
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
island
,
ran
in
my
mind
.
I
still
meditated
a
deliverance
from
*NL*
this
place
,
though
the
fear
of
greater
misfortunes
might
have
deterred
*NL*
me
from
it
.
--
For
,
allowing
that
I
had
attained
that
place
,
I
run
the
*NL*
hazard
of
being
killed
and
eaten
by
the
devouring
cannibals
:
and
if
they
*NL*
were
not
so
,
yet
I
might
be
slain
,
as
other
Europeans
had
been
,
who
fell
*NL*
into
their
hands
.
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
my
thoughts
ran
continually
*NL*
upon
that
shore
.
I
now
wished
for
my
boy
Xury
,
and
the
long
boat
,
with
*NL*
the
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
:
I
went
to
the
ship
's
boat
that
had
been
*NL*
cast
a
great
way
on
the
shore
in
the
late
storm
.
She
was
removed
but
a
*NL*
little
;
but
her
bottom
being
turned
up
by
the
impetuosity
and
fury
of
*NL*
the
waves
and
wind
,
I
fell
to
work
with
all
the
strength
I
had
,
with
*NL*
levers
and
rollers
I
had
cut
from
the
wood
,
to
turn
her
,
and
repair
the
*NL*
damages
she
had
sustained
.
This
work
took
me
up
three
or
four
weeks
,
*NL*
when
finding
my
little
strength
all
in
vain
,
I
fell
to
undermining
it
by
*NL*
digging
away
the
sand
,
and
so
to
make
it
fall
down
,
setting
pieces
of
*NL*
wood
to
thrust
and
guide
it
in
the
fall
.
But
after
this
was
done
,
I
was
*NL*
still
unable
to
stir
it
up
,
or
to
get
under
it
,
much
less
to
move
it
*NL*
forward
towards
the
water
,
and
so
I
was
forced
to
give
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
disapointment
,
however
did
not
frighten
me
.
I
began
to
think
*NL*
whether
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
make
a
canoe
or
perigua
,
such
as
*NL*
the
Indians
make
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
But
here
I
lay
under
particular
*NL*
inconveniencies
;
want
of
tools
to
make
it
,
and
want
of
hands
to
move
it
*NL*
in
the
water
when
it
was
made
.
However
,
to
work
I
went
upon
it
,
stopping
*NL*
all
the
inquiries
I
could
make
,
with
this
very
simple
answer
I
made
to
*NL*
myself
,
_
Let
's
first
make
it
,
I
'll
warrant
I
'll
find
some
way
or
other
*NL*
to
get
it
along
when
it
is
done
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
first
cut
down
a
cedar
tree
,
which
was
five
feet
ten
inches
diameter
*NL*
at
the
lower
part
next
the
stump
,
and
four
feet
eleven
inches
diameter
*NL*
at
the
end
of
twenty-two
feet
,
after
which
it
lessened
for
a
space
,
and
*NL*
then
parted
into
branches
.
Twenty
days
was
I
a
hacking
and
hewing
this
*NL*
tree
at
the
bottom
,
fourteen
more
in
cutting
off
the
branches
and
limbs
,
*NL*
and
a
whole
month
in
shaping
it
like
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
As
for
the
*NL*
inside
,
I
was
three
weeks
with
a
mallet
and
chissel
,
clearing
it
in
such
*NL*
a
manner
,
as
that
it
was
big
enough
to
carry
twenty-six
men
,
much
bigger
*NL*
than
any
canoe
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
,
and
confequentiy
sufficient
to
*NL*
transport
me
and
all
my
effects
to
that
wished-for
shore
I
so
*NL*
ardently
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
remained
now
,
but
,
indeed
,
the
greatest
difficulty
to
get
it
*NL*
into
the
water
,
it
lying
about
one
hundred
yards
from
it
.
To
remedy
the
*NL*
first
inconvenience
,
which
was
a
rising
hill
between
the
boat
and
the
*NL*
creek
,
with
wonderful
pains
and
labour
I
dug
into
the
bowels
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
made
a
declivity
.
But
when
this
was
done
,
all
the
strength
I
*NL*
had
was
as
insufficient
to
remove
it
,
as
it
was
when
I
attempted
to
*NL*
remove
the
boat
.
I
then
proceeded
to
measure
the
difference
of
ground
,
*NL*
resolving
to
make
a
canal
,
in
order
to
bring
the
water
to
the
canoe
,
*NL*
since
I
could
not
bring
the
canoe
to
the
water
.
But
as
this
seemed
to
be
*NL*
impracticable
to
myself
alone
,
under
the
space
of
eleven
or
twelve
*NL*
years
,
it
brought
me
into
some
sort
of
consideration
:
so
that
I
*NL*
concluded
this
also
to
be
impossible
,
and
the
attempt
altogether
vain
.
I
*NL*
now
saw
,
and
not
before
,
_
what
stupidity
it
is
to
begin
a
work
before
we
*NL*
reckon
its
costs
,
or
judge
rightly
our
own
abilities
to
go
through
with
*NL*
its
performance
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
height
of
this
work
my
fourth
year
expired
,
from
the
time
I
was
*NL*
cast
on
this
island
,
At
this
time
I
did
not
forget
my
anniversary
;
but
*NL*
kept
it
with
rather
greater
devotion
than
before
.
For
now
my
hopes
being
*NL*
frustrated
,
I
looked
upon
this
world
as
a
thing
had
nothing
to
do
with
;
*NL*
and
very
well
might
I
say
as
Father
Abraham
said
unto
Dives
,
_
Between
*NL*
thee
and
me
there
is
a
gulph
fixed
.
_
And
indeed
I
was
separated
from
its
*NL*
wickedness
too
,
having
neither
the
lust
of
the
flesh
,
the
lust
of
the
*NL*
eye
,
nor
the
pride
of
life
;
I
had
nothing
to
covet
,
being
lord
,
king
and
*NL*
emperor
over
the
whole
country
I
had
in
possession
,
without
dispute
and
*NL*
without
control
:
I
had
loadings
of
corn
,
plenty
of
turtles
,
timber
in
*NL*
abundance
,
and
grapes
above
measure
.
What
was
all
the
rest
to
me
?
the
*NL*
money
I
had
lay
by
me
as
despicable
dross
,
which
I
would
freely
have
*NL*
given
for
a
gross
of
tobacco
pipes
,
or
a
hard
mill
to
grind
my
corn
:
in
*NL*
a
word
the-nature
and
experience
of
these
things
dictated
to
me
this
*NL*
just
reflection
:
_
That
the
good
things
of
this
world
are
no
farther
*NL*
good
to
us
,
than
they
are
for
our
use
;
and
that
whatever
we
may
heap
up
*NL*
to
give
to
others
,
we
can
but
enjoy
as
much
as
we
use
,
and
no
more
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
rendered
my
mind
more
easy
than
usual
.
Every
time
I
sat
*NL*
down
to
meat
,
I
did
it
with
thankfulness
,
admiring
the
providential
hand
*NL*
of
God
,
who
in
this
wilderness
had
spread
a
table
to
me
.
And
now
I
*NL*
considered
what
I
enjoyed
,
rather
than
what
I
wanted
,
compared
my
*NL*
present
condition
with
what
I
at
first
expected
it
should
be
;
_
how
I
*NL*
should
have
done
,
if
I
had
got
nothing
out
of
the
ship
,
that
I
must
have
*NL*
perished
before
I
had
caught
fish
or
turtles
;
or
lived
,
had
I
found
*NL*
them
,
like
a
mere
savage
,
by
eating
them
raw
,
and
pulling
them
in
pieces
*NL*
with
my
claws
,
like
a
beast
_
.
I
next
compared
my
station
to
that
which
I
*NL*
deserved
:
_
how
undutiful
I
had
been
to
my
parents
;
how
destitute
of
the
*NL*
fear
of
God
;
bow
void
of
every
thing
that
was
good
;
and
how
ungrateful
*NL*
for
those
abundant
mercies
I
had
received
from
Heaven
,
being
fed
as
it
*NL*
were
,
by
a
miracle
,
even
as
great
as
Elijah
's
being
fed
by
ravens
;
and
*NL*
cast
on
a
place
where
there
is
no
venomous
creatures
to
poison
or
devour
*NL*
me
_
;
in
short
making
God
's
tender
mercies
matter
of
great
consolation
,
I
*NL*
relinquished
all
sadness
,
and
gave
way
to
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
my
ink
continued
,
which
with
water
I
made
last
as
long
as
I
*NL*
could
,
I
used
to
minute
down
the
days
of
the
month
on
which
any
*NL*
remarkable
event
happened
.
--
And
,
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
I
observed
,
_
that
the
same
day
I
forsook
my
parents
and
friends
,
*NL*
and
ran
away
to
Hull
,
in
order
to
go
to
sea
,
the
same
day
afterwards
in
*NL*
the
next
year
,
I
was
taken
and
made
a
slave
by
the
Sallee
rovers
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
That
the
very
day
I
escaped
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
in
Yarmouth
*NL*
roads
,
a
year
after
on
the
same
day
,
I
made
my
escape
from
Sallee
in
my
*NL*
patron
'
fishing
boat
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
And
on
the
30th
of
September
,
being
the
day
of
the
year
I
was
born
on
,
*NL*
on
that
day
twenty-six
years
after
,
was
I
miraculously
saved
,
and
cast
*NL*
ashore
on
this
island
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
that
wasted
after
my
ink
,
was
the
biscuit
which
I
had
*NL*
brought
out
of
the
ship
,
and
though
I
allowed
myself
but
one
cake
a
day
,
*NL*
for
above
a
twelvemonth
,
yet
I
was
quite
out
of
bread
for
near
a
year
,
*NL*
before
I
got
any
corn
of
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
my
clothes
began
to
decay
,
and
my
linen
had
been
gone
*NL*
long
before
.
However
,
I
had
preserved
about
three
dozen
of
the
sailors
*NL*
chequered
shirts
,
which
proved
a
great
refreshment
to
me
,
when
the
*NL*
violent
beams
of
the
sun
would
not
suffer
me
to
bear
any
of
the
seamen
's
*NL*
heavy
watch
coats
,
which
made
me
turn
taylor
,
and
,
after
a
miserable
*NL*
botching
manner
,
convert
them
to
jackets
.
To
preserve
my
head
,
I
made
*NL*
me
a
cap
of
goat-skins
,
with
the
hair
outwards
to
keep
out
the
rain
;
*NL*
which
indeed
served
me
so
well
,
that
afterwards
I
made
me
a
waistcoat
*NL*
and
opened-kneed
breeches
of
the
fame
:
And
then
I
contrived
a
sort
of
an
*NL*
umbrella
,
covering
it
with
skins
,
which
not
only
kept
out
the
heat
of
*NL*
the
sun
,
but
rain
also
.
Thus
being
easy
,
and
settled
in
my
mind
,
my
*NL*
chief
happiness
was
to
converse
with
God
,
in
most
heavenly
and
*NL*
comfortable
ejaculations
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
five
years
after
this
I
can
not
say
any
extraordinary
thing
occured
*NL*
to
me
.
My
chief
employment
was
to
cure
my
raisins
,
and
plant
my
barley
*NL*
and
rice
,
of
both
which
I
had
a
year
's
provision
beforehand
.
But
though
*NL*
I
was
disapointed
in
my
first
canoe
,
I
made
it
,
at
intermediate
times
,
*NL*
my
business
to
make
a
second
,
of
much
inferior
size
;
and
it
was
*NL*
two-years
before
I
had
finished
it
.
But
as
I
perceived
it
would
no
wife
*NL*
answer
my
design
of
failing
to
the
other
shore
,
my
thoughts
were
*NL*
consigned
to
take
a
tour
round
the
island
,
to
see
what
further
*NL*
discoveries
I
could
make
.
To
this
intent
,
after
having
moved
her
to
the
*NL*
water
,
and
tried
how
she
would
sail
,
I
fitted
up
a
little
raft
to
my
*NL*
boat
,
and
made
a
sail
of
the
ships
sail
that
by
me
.
I
then
made
lockers
*NL*
or
boxes
at
the
end
of
it
,
to
put
in
necessaries
,
provision
,
and
*NL*
ammunition
,
which
would
preserve
them
dry
,
either
from
rain
or
the
spray
*NL*
of
the
sea
;
and
in
the
inside
of
the
boat
,
I
cut
me
a
long
hollow
place
*NL*
to
lay
my
gun
in
,
and
to
keep
it
dry
made
a
flag
to
hang
over
it
.
My
*NL*
umbrella
I
fixed
in
a
step
in
the
stern
,
like
a
mast
,
to
keep
the
heat
*NL*
of
the
sun
off
me
.
And
now
resolving
to
see
the
circumference
of
my
*NL*
little
kingdom
,
I
victualled
my
ship
for
the
voyage
,
putting
in
two
*NL*
dozen
of
my
barley-bread
loaves
,
an
earthen
pot-full
of
parched
rice
,
a
*NL*
little
bottle
of
rum
,
half
a
goat
,
powder
and
shot
,
and
two
watch
coats
.
*NL*
It
was
the
_
6th
_
of
November
,
in
the
_
6th
_
year
of
my
reign
,
or
*NL*
captivity
,
that
I
set
out
in
this
voyage
;
which
was
much
longer
than
I
*NL*
expected
,
being
obliged
to
put
further
out
,
by
reason
of
the
rocks
that
*NL*
lay
a
great
way
in
the
sea
.
And
indeed
so
much
did
these
rocks
surprise
*NL*
me
,
that
I
was
for
putting
back
,
fearing
that
if
I
ventured
farther
it
*NL*
would
be
out
of
my
power
to
return
in
this
uncertainty
I
came
to
an
*NL*
anchor
just
off
shore
,
to
which
I
waded
with
my
gun
on
my
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
then
climbing
up
a
hill
,
which
overlooked
that
point
,
I
saw
the
full
*NL*
extent
of
it
,
and
so
resolved
to
run
all
hazards
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
prospect
from
the
hill
,
I
perceived
a
violent
current
running
to
*NL*
the
east
,
coming
very
close
to
the
point
;
which
I
the
more
carefully
*NL*
observed
,
thinking
it
dangerous
,
and
that
when
I
came
to
it
,
I
might
be
*NL*
drove
into
the
sea
by
its
force
,
and
not
able
to
return
to
the
island
;
*NL*
and
certainly
it
must
have
been
so
,
had
I
not
made
this
observation
;
for
*NL*
on
the
other
side
was
the
like
current
,
with
this
difference
,
that
it
*NL*
set
off
at
a
greater
distance
;
and
I
perceived
there
was
a
strong
eddy
*NL*
under
the
land
;
so
that
my
chief
business
was
to
work
out
of
the
first
*NL*
current
,
and
conveniently
get
into
the
eddy
.
Two
days
I
staid
here
,
the
*NL*
wind
blowing
very
briskly
E.S.E.
which
being
contrary
to
the
current
,
*NL*
leaves
a
great
breach
of
the
sea
upon
the
point
;
so
it
was
neither
fit
*NL*
for
me
to
keep
too
near
the
shore
,
on
account
of
the
breach
;
nor
stand
*NL*
at
too
great
a
distance
,
for
fear
of
the
streams
.
That
night
the
wind
*NL*
abating
,
it
grew
so
calm
,
that
I
ventured
out
;
&
here
I
may
be
a
*NL*
monument
to
all
rash
and
ignorant
pilots
;
for
I
was
no
sooner
come
to
*NL*
the
point
and
not
above
the
boat
's
length
from
shore
,
but
I
was
going
*NL*
into
a
deep
water
,
with
a
current
like
a
mill
,
which
drove
my
boat
along
*NL*
so
violently
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
keep
near
the
edge
of
it
,
*NL*
but
forced
me
more
and
more
out
from
the
eddy
to
the
left
of
me
;
and
all
*NL*
I
could
do
with
my
paddle
were
useless
,
there
being
no
wind
to
help
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
began
to
look
upon
myself
as
quite
lost
,
since
as
,
the
current
ran
*NL*
on
both
sides
of
the
island
,
I
was
very
certain
they
must
join
again
,
*NL*
and
then
I
had
no
hope
but
of
perishing
for
want
in
the
sea
,
after
what
*NL*
provision
I
had
was
spent
,
or
before
,
if
a
storm
should
happen
to
arise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
can
conceive
the
present
anguish
of
my
mind
at
this
calamity
?
with
*NL*
longing
eyes
did
I
look
upon
my
little
kingdom
,
and
thought
the
island
*NL*
the
pleasantest
place
in
the
universe
.
_
Happy
,
thrice
happy
desert
_
,
*NL*
said
I
,
_
shall
I
never
see
thee
more
?
_
_
Wretched
creature
!
wither
am
I
*NL*
going
?
Why
did
I
murmur
at
my
lonesome
condition
,
when
now
I
would
give
*NL*
the
whole
world
to
be
thither
again
?
_
While
I
was
thus
complaining
,
I
*NL*
found
myself
to
be
driven
about
two
leagues
into
the
sea
;
however
,
I
*NL*
laboured
till
my
strength
was
far
spent
,
to
keep
my
boat
as
far
north
as
*NL*
possibly
I
could
,
to
that
side
of
the
current
where
the
eddy
lay
on
.
*NL*
About
noon
I
perceived
a
little
breeze
of
wind
spring
up
from
the
S.S.E.
*NL*
which
overjoyed
my
heart
;
and
was
still
more
elated
,
when
,
in
about
half
*NL*
an
hour
it
blew
a
gentle
fine
gale
.
Had
any
thick
weather
sprung
up
,
I
*NL*
had
been
left
another
way
;
for
having
no
compass
onboard
,
I
should
never
*NL*
have
found
the
way
to
steer
towards
the
island
,
if
once
it
had
*NL*
disappeared
;
but
it
proving
the
contrary
,
I
set
up
my
mast
again
,
spread
*NL*
my
sail
,
and
stood
away
northward
,
as
much
as
I
could
,
to
get
rid
of
the
*NL*
current
.
And
no
sooner
did
the
boat
begin
to
stretch
away
,
but
I
*NL*
perceived
by
the
clearness
of
the
water
,
a
change
of
the
current
was
*NL*
near
;
for
,
where
it
was
strong
,
the
water
was
foul
;
and
where
it
was
*NL*
clear
the
current
abated
.
To
the
east
,
I
soon
saw
about
half
a
mile
,
a
*NL*
breach
of
the
sea
upon
,
some
rocks
,
which
caused
it
again
to
separate
;
*NL*
and
as
the
main
force
of
it
drove
away
more
southwardly
,
leaving
the
*NL*
rocks
to
the
north-east
,
so
the
other
came
back
by
the
repulse
of
the
*NL*
rocks
making
a
sharp
eddy
,
which
returned
back
again
to
the
north-west
*NL*
with
a
very
swift
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
who
have
experienced
what
it
is
to
be
reprieved
upon
the
ladder
,
or
*NL*
to
be
saved
from
thieves
,
just
going
to
take
away
their
lives
,
or
such
*NL*
as
have
been
in
the
like
calamities
with
my
own
,
may
guess
my
present
*NL*
excess
of
joy
,
how
heartily
I
ran
my
boat
into
the
stream
of
this
eddy
,
*NL*
and
how
joyfully
I
spread
my
sail
to
the
refreshing
wind
,
standing
*NL*
cheerfully
before
it
,
with
a
smart
tide
under
foot
.
By
the
assistance
of
*NL*
this
eddy
,
I
was
carried
above
a
league
home
again
,
when
being
in
the
*NL*
wake
of
the
island
,
betwixt
the
two
currents
,
I
found
the
water
to
be
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
a
stand
.
About
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
I
reached
within
*NL*
a
league
of
the
island
,
and
perceived
the
points
of
the
rock
,
which
*NL*
caused
this
disaster
,
stretching
out
,
as
I
observed
before
,
to
the
*NL*
southward
,
which
throwing
off
the
current
more
southwardly
had
*NL*
occasioned
another
eddy
to
the
north
.
But
having
a
fair
brisk
gale
,
I
*NL*
stretched
across
this
eddy
,
and
in
an
hour
came
within
a
mile
of
the
*NL*
shore
,
where
I
soon
landed
to
my
unspeakable
comfort
;
and
after
an
*NL*
humble
prostration
,
thanking
God
for
my
deliverance
,
with
a
resolution
*NL*
to
lay
all
thoughts
of
escaping
aside
,
I
brought
my
boat
safe
to
a
*NL*
little
cove
,
and
laid
me
down
to
take
a
welcome
repose
.
When
I
awoke
I
*NL*
was
considering
how
I
might
get
my
boat
home
;
and
coasting
along
the
*NL*
shore
,
I
came
to
a
good
bay
,
which
ran
up
to
a
rivulet
or
brook
,
where
*NL*
finding
a
safe
harbour
,
I
stowed
her
as
safe
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
*NL*
dry-dock
made
on
purpose
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
perceived
myself
not
far
from
the
place
where
before
I
had
*NL*
travelled
on
foot
;
so
taking
nothing
with
me
except
my
gun
and
umbrella
,
*NL*
I
began
my
journey
,
and
in
the
evening
came
to
my
bower
,
where
I
again
*NL*
laid
me
down
to
rest
.
I
had
not
slept
long
before
I
was
awakened
in
*NL*
great
surprise
,
by
a
strange
voice
that
called
me
several
times
.
_
Robin
,
*NL*
Robin
,
Robinson
Crusoe
,
poor
Robin
!
Where
are
you
,
Robinson
Crusoe
?
*NL*
Where
are
you
?
Where
have
you
been
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
fast
was
I
asleep
at
first
,
that
I
did
not
awake
thoroughly
:
but
half
*NL*
asleep
and
half
awake
,
I
thought
I
dreamed
that
somebody
spoke
to
me
.
*NL*
But
,
as
the
voice
repeated
_
Robinson
Crusoe
_
several
times
,
being
*NL*
terribly
affrighted
,
I
started
up
in
utmost
confusion
;
and
,
no
sooner
*NL*
were
my
eyes
fully
open
,
but
I
beheld
my
pretty
Poll
sitting
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
hedge
,
and
soon
knew
that
it
was
he
that
called
me
;
for
just
in
*NL*
such
bewailing
language
I
used
to
talk
and
teach
him
;
which
he
so
*NL*
exactly
learned
that
he
would
sit
upon
my
finger
and
lay
his
bill
close
*NL*
to
my
face
,
and
cry
,
_
Poor
Robinson
Crusoe
,
where
are
you
?
where
have
*NL*
you
been
?
how
came
you
here
_
?
and
such
like
prattle
I
had
constantly
*NL*
taught
him
.
But
even
though
I
knew
it
to
be
the
parrot
,
it
was
a
great
*NL*
while
before
I
could
adjust
myself
;
being
amazed
how
the
creature
got
*NL*
thither
,
and
that
he
should
fix
about
that
place
;
and
no
where
else
.
*NL*
But
now
being
assured
it
could
be
no
other
than
my
honest
Poll
,
my
*NL*
wonder
ceased
,
and
reaching
out
my
hand
,
and
calling
familiarly
Poll
,
*NL*
the
creature
came
to
me
,
and
perched
upon
my
thumb
as
he
was
wont
,
*NL*
constantly
prating
to
me
with
_
Poor
Robinson
Crusoe
,
and
how
did
I
come
*NL*
here
,
and
where
had
I
been
?
_
as
if
the
bird
was
overjoyed
to
see
me
;
and
*NL*
so
I
took
him
home
along
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
pretty
well
cured
of
my
rambling
to
sea
;
yet
I
could
wish
my
*NL*
boat
,
which
had
cost
me
so
much
trouble
and
pains
,
on
this
side
the
*NL*
island
once
more
,
but
which
indeed
was
impracticable
.
I
therefore
began
*NL*
to
lead
a
very
retired
life
,
living
near
a
twelvemonth
in
a
very
*NL*
contented
manner
,
wanting
for
nothing
except
conversation
.
As
to
*NL*
mechanic
labours
,
which
my
necessities
obliged
me
to
,
I
fancied
I
could
,
*NL*
upon
occasion
,
make
a
tolerable
carpenter
were
the
poor
tools
I
had
to
*NL*
work
withal
but
good
.
Besides
,
as
I
improved
in
my
earthen
ware
,
I
*NL*
contrived
to
make
them
with
a
wheel
,
which
I
found
much
easier
and
*NL*
better
,
making
my
work
shapely
,
which
before
was
rude
and
ugly
.
But
I
*NL*
think
I
was
never
so
elevated
with
my
own
performance
or
project
,
than
*NL*
for
being
able
to
make
a
tobacco-pipe
,
which
though
it
proved
an
awkward
*NL*
clumsy
thing
,
yet
it
was
very
sound
,
and
carried
the
smoke
perfectly
*NL*
well
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
also
improved
my
wicker
ware
,
making
me
abundance
of
necessary
*NL*
baskets
,
which
though
not
very
handsome
,
were
very
handy
and
convenient
*NL*
to
fetch
things
home
in
,
as
also
for
holding
my
stores
,
barley
,
rice
,
*NL*
and
other
provisions
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
powder
beginning
to
fail
,
made
me
examine
after
what
manner
I
should
*NL*
kill
the
goats
or
birds
to
live
on
after
it
was
all
gone
.
Upon
which
I
*NL*
contrived
many
ways
to
ensnare
the
goats
,
and
see
if
I
could
catch
them
*NL*
alive
,
particularly
a
she-goat
with
young
.
At
last
I
had
my
desire
,
for
*NL*
making
pitfalls
and
traps
baited
with
barley
and
rice
,
I
found
one
*NL*
morning
,
in
one
of
them
,
an
old
he-goat
,
and
in
the
other
three
kids
,
*NL*
one
male
,
the
other
two
females
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
boisterous
was
the
old
one
,
that
I
could
not
bring
him
away
.
But
I
*NL*
forgot
the
old
proverb
,
_
That
hunger
will
tame
a
lion
_
:
For
had
I
kept
*NL*
him
three
or
four
days
without
provisions
,
and
then
given
him
some
*NL*
water
,
with
a
little
corn
,
he
would
have
been
as
tame
as
a
young
kid
.
*NL*
The
other
creatures
I
bound
with
strings
together
;
but
I
had
great
*NL*
difficulty
before
I
could
bring
them
to
my
habitation
.
It
was
some
time
*NL*
before
they
would
feed
;
but
throwing
them
sweet
corn
it
so
much
tempted
*NL*
them
,
that
they
began
to
be
tamer
.
From
hence
I
concluded
,
that
if
I
*NL*
designed
to
furnish
myself
with
goat
's
flesh
,
when
my
ammunition
was
*NL*
spent
,
the
tamely
breeding
them
up
,
like
a
flock
of
sheep
,
about
my
*NL*
settlement
,
was
the
only
method
I
could
take
.
I
concluded
also
I
must
*NL*
separate
the
wild
from
the
tame
,
or
else
they
would
always
run
wild
as
*NL*
they
grew
up
;
and
the
best
way
for
this
,
was
to
have
some
inclosed
piece
*NL*
of
ground
,
well
fenced
,
either
with
a
hedge
or
pale
,
to
keep
them
so
*NL*
effectually
,
that
those
within
might
not
break
out
,
or
those
without
*NL*
break
in
.
Such
an
undertaking
was
very
great
for
one
pair
of
hands
;
but
*NL*
as
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
doing
it
,
my
first
care
was
to
*NL*
find
a
convenient
piece
of
ground
where
there
was
likely
to
be
herbage
*NL*
for
them
to
eat
,
water
to
drink
,
and
cover
to
keep
them
from
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
again
,
I
gave
another
instance
of
my
ignorance
and
inexperience
,
*NL*
pitching
upon
a
piece
of
meadow
land
so
large
,
that
had
I
inclosed
it
,
*NL*
the
hedge
or
pale
must
have
been
at
least
two
miles
about
.
Indeed
had
it
*NL*
been
ten
miles
,
I
had
time
enough
to
do
it
in
;
but
then
I
did
not
*NL*
consider
that
my
goats
would
be
as
wild
in
so
much
compass
,
as
if
they
*NL*
had
had
the
whole
island
,
and
consequently
as
difficult
for
me
to
catch
*NL*
them
.
This
thought
came
into
my
head
,
after
I
had
carried
it
on
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
about
fifty
yards
;
I
therefore
altered
my
scheme
,
and
resolved
*NL*
to
inclose
a
piece
of
ground
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
*NL*
length
,
and
one
hundred
in
breadth
,
sufficient
enough
for
as
many
as
*NL*
would
maintain
me
,
till
such
time
as
my
flock
increased
,
and
then
I
*NL*
could
add
more
ground
.
I
now
vigorously
prosecuted
my
work
,
and
it
took
*NL*
me
about
three
months
in
hedging
the
first
piece
;
in
which
time
I
*NL*
tethered
the
three
kids
in
the
best
part
of
it
,
feeding
them
as
near
me
*NL*
as
possible
,
to
make
them
familiar
:
and
indeed
I
very
often
would
carry
*NL*
some
ears
of
barley
or
a
handful
of
rice
,
and
feed
them
out
of
my
hands
;
*NL*
by
which
they
grew
so
tame
,
that
when
my
inclosure
was
finished
,
and
I
*NL*
had
let
them
loose
they
would
run
after
me
for
a
handful
of
corn
.
This
*NL*
indeed
answered
my
end
;
and
in
a
year
and
half
's
time
I
had
a
flock
of
*NL*
about
twelve
goats
,
kids
and
all
;
and
in
two
years
after
,
they
amounted
*NL*
to
forty-three
,
besides
what
I
had
taken
and
killed
for
my
sustenance
.
*NL*
After
which
I
inclosed
five
several
pieces
of
ground
to
feed
them
in
,
*NL*
with
pens
to
drive
them
into
,
that
I
might
take
them
as
I
had
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
project
I
likewise
found
additional
blessings
;
for
I
not
only
*NL*
had
plenty
of
goat
's
flesh
,
but
milk
too
,
which
in
my
beginning
I
did
*NL*
not
so
much
as
think
of
.
And
,
indeed
,
though
I
had
never
milked
a
cow
,
*NL*
much
less
a
goat
,
or
seen
butter
or
cheese
made
,
yet
,
after
some
essays
*NL*
and
miscarriages
,
I
made
the
both
,
and
never
afterwards
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
mercifully
can
the
omnipotent
Power
comfort
his
creatures
,
even
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
their
greatest
calamities
?
How
can
be
sweeten
the
bitterest
*NL*
providences
,
and
give
us
reason
to
magnify
him
in
dungeons
and
prisons
?
*NL*
what
a
bounteous
table
was
here
spread
in
a
wilderness
for
me
,
where
I
*NL*
expected
nothing
thing
at
first
but
to
perish
for
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
a
Stoic
would
have
smiled
to
see
me
at
dinner
.
There
sat
my
*NL*
royal
majesty
,
and
absolute
prince
and
ruler
of
my
kingdom
,
attended
by
*NL*
my
dutiful
subjects
,
whom
,
if
I
pleased
,
I
could
either
hang
,
draw
,
*NL*
quarter
,
give
them
liberty
,
or
take
it
away
.
When
I
dined
,
I
seemed
a
*NL*
king
eating
alone
,
none
daring
to
presume
to
do
so
till
I
had
done
.
*NL*
_
Poll
_
,
as
if
he
had
been
my
principal
court
favorite
,
was
the
only
*NL*
person
,
permitted
to
talk
with
me
.
My
old
but
faithful
dog
,
now
grown
*NL*
exceedingly
crazy
,
and
who
had
no
species
to
multiply
his
kind
upon
,
*NL*
continually
sat
on
my
right
hand
;
while
my
two
cats
sat
on
each
side
of
*NL*
the
table
,
expecting
a
bit
from
my
hand
,
as
a
principal
mark
of
my
royal
*NL*
favour
.
These
were
not
the
cats
I
had
brought
from
the
ship
;
they
had
*NL*
been
dead
long
before
,
and
interred
near
my
habitation
by
mine
own
hand
.
*NL*
But
one
of
them
,
as
I
suppose
,
generating
with
a
wild
cat
,
a
couple
of
*NL*
their
young
I
had
made
tame
;
the
rest
ran
wild
into
the
woods
,
and
in
*NL*
time
grew
so
impudent
as
to
return
and
plunder
me
of
my
stores
,
till
*NL*
such
time
as
I
shot
a
great
many
,
and
the
rest
left
me
without
troubling
*NL*
me
any
more
.
In
this
plentiful
manner
did
I
live
,
wanting
for
nothing
*NL*
but
conversation
.
One
thing
indeed
concerned
me
,
the
want
of
my
boat
;
I
*NL*
knew
not
which
way
to
get
her
round
the
island
.
One
time
I
resolved
to
*NL*
go
along
the
shore
by
land
to
her
;
but
had
any
one
in
England
met
such
a
*NL*
figure
,
it
would
either
have
affrighted
them
,
or
made
them
burst
into
*NL*
laughter
;
nay
,
I
could
not
but
smile
myself
at
my
habit
,
which
I
think
*NL*
in
this
place
will
be
very
proper
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cap
I
wore
on
my
head
,
was
great
,
high
,
and
shapeless
,
made
of
a
*NL*
goat
's
skin
,
with
a
flap
of
pent-house
hanging
down
behind
,
not
only
to
*NL*
keep
the
sun
from
me
,
but
to
shoot
the
rain
off
from
running
into
my
*NL*
neck
,
nothing
being
more
pernicious
than
the
rain
falling
upon
the
flesh
*NL*
in
these
climates
.
I
had
a
short
jacket
of
goat
's
skin
,
whose
hair
hung
*NL*
down
such
a
length
on
each
side
,
that
it
reached
down
to
the
calves
of
*NL*
my
legs
.
As
for
shoes
and
stockings
,
I
had
none
,
but
made
a
semblance
of
*NL*
something
,
I
know
not
what
to
call
them
;
they
were
made
like
buskins
,
*NL*
and
laced
on
the
sides
like
spatterdashes
,
Barbarously
shaped
like
the
*NL*
rest
of
my
habit
.
I
had
a
broad
belt
of
goat
's
skin
dried
,
girt
round
me
*NL*
with
a
couple
of
thongs
,
instead
of
buckles
;
on
each
of
which
,
to
supply
*NL*
the
deficiency
of
sword
and
dagger
,
hung
my
hatchet
and
saw
.
I
had
*NL*
another
belt
,
not
so
broad
,
yet
fastened
in
the
same
manner
,
which
hung
*NL*
over
my
shoulder
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
,
under
my
left
arm
,
hung
two
*NL*
pouches
,
made
of
goat
's
skin
,
to
hold
my
powder
and
shot
.
My
basket
I
*NL*
carried
on
my
back
,
and
my
gun
on
my
shoulder
;
and
over
my
head
a
great
*NL*
clumsy
ugly
goat
's
skin
umbrella
;
which
,
however
,
next
to
my
gun
,
was
*NL*
the
most
necessary
thing
about
me
.
As
for
my
face
,
the
colour
was
not
*NL*
so
swarthy
as
the
Mulattoes
,
or
might
have
been
expected
from
one
who
*NL*
took
to
little
care
of
it
,
in
a
climate
within
nine
or
ten
degrees
of
*NL*
the
equinox
.
At
one
time
my
beard
grew
so
long
that
it
hung
down
about
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
yard
;
but
as
I
had
both
razors
scissors
in
store
,
I
cut
it
*NL*
all
off
,
and
suffered
none
to
grow
,
except
a
large
pair
of
Mahometan
*NL*
whiskers
,
the
like
of
which
I
had
seen
wore
by
some
Turks
at
Sallee
,
not
*NL*
long
enough
indeed
to
hang
a
hat
upon
,
but
of
such
a
monstrous
size
,
as
*NL*
would
have
amazed
any
in
England
to
have
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
was
of
no
consequence
here
,
there
being
none
to
observe
my
*NL*
behavior
or
habit
.
And
so
,
without
fear
and
without
controul
,
I
*NL*
proceeded
on
my
journey
,
the
prosecution
of
which
took
me
up
five
or
six
*NL*
days
.
I
first
travelled
along
the
sea
shore
,
directly
to
the
place
where
*NL*
I
first
brought
my
boat
to
an
anchor
,
to
get
upon
the
rocks
;
but
now
*NL*
having
no
boat
to
take
care
of
,
I
went
overland
a
nearer
way
to
the
same
*NL*
height
that
I
was
before
upon
;
when
looking
forward
to
the
point
of
the
*NL*
rock
,
which
lay
out
,
and
which
I
was
forced
to
double
with
my
boat
,
I
*NL*
was
amazed
to
see
the
sea
so
smooth
and
quiet
,
there
being
no
ripling
*NL*
motion
,
nor
current
,
any
more
than
in
other
places
.
This
made
me
ponder
*NL*
some
time
to
guess
the
reason
of
it
,
when
at
last
I
was
convinced
that
*NL*
the
ebb
setting
from
the
west
,
and
joining
with
the
current
of
water
*NL*
from
some
great
river
on
shore
,
must
be
the
occasion
of
these
rapid
*NL*
streams
;
&
that
,
consequently
,
as
the
winds
blew
more
westwardly
,
or
*NL*
more
southwardly
,
so
the
current
came
he
nearer
,
or
went
the
farther
*NL*
from
the
shore
.
To
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
I
waited
there
till
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
time
of
ebb
being
made
,
I
plainly
perceived
from
the
rock
the
*NL*
current
again
as
before
,
with
the
difference
that
it
ran
farther
off
,
*NL*
near
half
a
league
from
the
shore
,
whereas
in
my
expedition
,
it
set
*NL*
close
upon
it
,
furiously
hurrying
me
and
my
canoe
along
with
it
,
which
*NL*
at
another
time
would
not
have
done
.
And
now
I
was
convinced
,
that
,
by
*NL*
observing
the
ebbing
and
flowing
of
the
tide
I
might
easily
bring
my
*NL*
boat
round
the
island
again
.
But
when
I
began
to
think
of
putting
it
in
*NL*
practice
,
the
remembrance
of
the
late
danger
,
struck
me
with
such
*NL*
horror
,
that
I
changed
my
resolution
,
and
formed
another
,
which
was
more
*NL*
safe
,
though
more
laborious
;
and
this
was
to
make
another
canoe
,
and
to
*NL*
have
one
for
one
side
of
the
island
,
and
one
for
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
two
plantations
in
the
island
;
the
first
my
little
*NL*
fortification
,
fort
,
or
castle
,
with
many
large
and
spacious
*NL*
improvements
;
for
by
this
time
I
had
enlarged
the
cave
behind
me
with
*NL*
several
little
caves
,
one
with
another
,
to
hold
my
baskets
,
corn
,
and
*NL*
straw
.
The
piles
with
which
I
made
my
wall
were
grown
so
lofty
and
great
*NL*
as
obscured
my
habitation
.
And
near
this
commodious
and
pleasant
*NL*
settlement
,
lay
my
well
cultivated
and
improved
corn-fields
,
which
*NL*
kindly
yielded
me
their
fruit
in
the
proper
season
.
My
second
plantation
*NL*
was
that
near
my
country
seat
,
or
little
bower
,
where
my
grapes
*NL*
flourished
,
and
where
,
having
planted
many
stakes
,
I
made
inclosures
for
*NL*
my
goats
,
so
strongly
fortified
by
labour
and
time
,
that
it
was
much
*NL*
stronger
than
a
wall
,
and
consequently
impossible
for
them
to
break
*NL*
through
.
As
for
my
bower
itself
,
I
kept
it
constantly
in
repair
,
and
cut
*NL*
the
trees
in
such
a
manner
,
as
made
them
grow
thick
and
wild
,
and
form
a
*NL*
most
delightful
shade
.
In
the
centre
of
this
stood
my
tent
,
thus
*NL*
erected
.
I
had
driven
four
piles
in
the
ground
,
spreading
over
it
a
*NL*
piece
of
the
ship
's
sail
;
beneath
which
I
made
a
sort
of
couch
with
the
*NL*
skins
of
the
creatures
I
had
slain
,
and
other
things
;
and
having
laid
*NL*
thereon
one
of
the
sailor
's
blankets
,
which
I
had
saved
from
the
wreck
*NL*
of
the
ship
,
and
covering
myself
with
a
great
watch-coat
,
I
took
up
this
*NL*
place
for
my
country
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
frequently
from
this
settlement
did
I
use
to
visit
my
boat
,
and
*NL*
keep
her
in
very
good
order
.
And
sometimes
I
would
venture
in
her
a
cast
*NL*
or
two
from
shore
,
but
no
further
,
lest
either
a
strong
current
,
a
*NL*
sudden
stormy
wind
,
or
some
unlucky
accident
should
hurry
me
from
the
*NL*
island
as
before
.
But
now
I
entreat
your
attention
,
whilst
I
proceed
to
*NL*
inform
you
of
a
new
,
but
most
surprising
scent
of
life
which
there
*NL*
befel
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
easily
suppose
,
that
,
after
having
been
here
so
long
,
nothing
*NL*
could
be
more
amazing
than
to
see
a
human
creature
.
One
day
it
happened
,
*NL*
that
going
to
my
boat
I
saw
the
print
of
a
man
's
naked
foot
on
the
*NL*
shore
,
very
evident
on
the
sand
,
as
the
toes
,
heel
,
and
every
part
of
*NL*
it
.
Had
I
seen
an
apparition
in
the
most
frightful
shape
,
I
could
not
*NL*
have
been
more
confounded
.
My
willing
ears
gave
the
strictest
attention
.
*NL*
I
cast
my
eyes
around
,
but
could
satisfy
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
,
*NL*
I
proceeded
alternately
in
every
part
of
the
shore
,
but
with
equal
*NL*
effect
;
neither
could
I
see
any
other
mark
,
though
the
sand
about
it
was
*NL*
as
susceptible
to
take
impression
,
as
that
which
was
so
plainly
stamped
.
*NL*
Thus
struck
with
confusion
and
horror
,
I
returned
to
my
habitation
,
*NL*
frightened
at
every
bush
and
tree
,
taking
every
thing
for
men
;
and
*NL*
possessed
with
the
wildest
ideas
.
That
night
my
eyes
never
closed
.
I
*NL*
formed
nothing
but
the
most
dismal
imaginations
,
concluding
it
must
be
*NL*
the
mark
of
the
devil
's
foot
which
I
had
seen
.
For
otherwise
how
could
*NL*
any
mortal
come
to
this
island
?
where
was
the
ship
that
transported
*NL*
them
?
&
what
signs
of
any
other
footsteps
?
Though
these
seemed
very
*NL*
strong
reasons
for
such
a
supposition
,
yet
-LRB-
thought
I
-RRB-
why
should
the
*NL*
devil
make
the
print
of
his
foot
to
no
purpose
,
as
I
can
see
,
when
he
*NL*
might
have
taken
other
ways
to
have
terrified
me
?
why
should
he
leave
*NL*
his
mark
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
and
that
too
on
the
sand
,
*NL*
where
the
surging
waves
of
the
ocean
might
soon
have
erased
the
*NL*
impression
.
Surely
this
action
is
not
consistent
with
the
subtility
of
*NL*
Satan
,
said
I
to
myself
;
but
rather
must
be
some
dangerous
creature
,
*NL*
some
wild
savage
of
the
main
land
over
against
me
,
that
venturing
too
*NL*
far
in
the
ocean
,
has
been
driven
here
,
either
by
the
violent
currents
*NL*
or
contrary
winds
;
and
not
caring
to
stay
on
this
desolate
island
,
has
*NL*
gone
back
to
sea
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
Happy
,
indeed
,
said
I
to
myself
,
that
none
of
the
savages
had
seen
me
in
*NL*
that
place
:
yet
I
was
not
altogether
without
fear
,
lest
,
having
found
my
*NL*
boar
,
they
should
return
in
numbers
and
devour
me
;
or
at
least
carry
*NL*
away
all
my
corn
,
and
destroy
my
flock
of
tame
goats
.
In
a
word
,
all
my
*NL*
religious
hopes
vanished
,
as
though
I
thought
God
would
not
now
protect
*NL*
me
by
his
power
,
who
had
so
wonderfully
preserved
me
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
various
chains
of
Providence
are
there
in
the
life
of
man
!
How
*NL*
changeable
are
our
affections
,
according
to
different
circumstances
!
We
*NL*
love
to-day
,
what
we
hate
to-morrow
;
we
shun
one
hour
,
what
we
seek
the
*NL*
next
.
This
was
evident
in
me
in
the
most
conspicous
manner
:
For
I
,
who
*NL*
before
had
so
much
lamented
my
condition
,
in
being
banished
from
all
*NL*
human
kind
,
was
now
even
ready
to
expire
,
when
I
considered
that
a
man
*NL*
had
set
his
foot
on
this
desolate
island
.
But
when
I
considered
my
*NL*
station
of
life
decreed
by
the
infinitely
wise
and
good
providence
of
*NL*
God
,
that
I
ought
not
to
dispute
my
Creator
's
sovereignty
,
who
has
an
*NL*
unbounded
right
to
govern
and
dispose
of
his
creatures
as
he
thinks
*NL*
convenient
;
and
that
his
justice
and
mercy
could
either
punish
or
*NL*
deliver
me
:
I
say
when
I
considered
all
this
,
I
comfortably
found
it
my
*NL*
duty
to
trust
sincerely
in
him
,
pray
ardently
to
him
,
and
humbly
resign
*NL*
myself
to
his
divine
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
lying
on
my
bed
,
these
words
of
the
sacred
writings
came
*NL*
into
my
mind
,
_
Call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
I
will
deliver
*NL*
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
.
_
Upon
this
sentence
,
rising
more
*NL*
cheerfully
from
my
bed
,
I
offered
up
my
prayers
in
the
most
heavenly
*NL*
manner
;
and
when
I
had
done
,
taking
up
my
Bible
to
read
,
these
words
*NL*
appeared
first
in
my
sight
:
--
_
Wait
on
the
Lord
,
and
be
of
good
cheer
,
*NL*
and
he
shall
strengthen
thy
heart
:
Wait
,
I
say
,
on
the
Lord
.
_
Such
*NL*
divine
comfort
did
this
give
me
,
as
to
remove
all
cause
of
sadness
upon
*NL*
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
after
a
world
of
apprehensions
and
fears
,
for
three
days
and
*NL*
nights
,
I
at
last
ventured
out
of
my
castle
,
and
milked
my
goats
,
one
of
*NL*
which
was
almost
spoiled
for
want
of
it
.
I
next
-LRB-
though
in
great
fear
-RRB-
*NL*
visited
my
bower
,
and
milked
my
flocks
there
also
;
when
,
growing
bolder
,
*NL*
I
went
down
to
the
shore
again
,
and
measuring
the
print
of
the
foot
to
*NL*
mine
,
to
see
,
perhaps
,
whether
I
myself
had
not
occasioned
that
mark
,
I
*NL*
found
it
much
superior
in
largeness
;
and
so
returned
home
,
now
*NL*
absolutely
convinced
that
either
some
men
had
been
ashore
,
or
that
the
*NL*
island
must
be
inhabited
,
and
therefore
that
I
might
be
surprised
before
*NL*
I
was
aware
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
to
think
of
providing
for
my
security
,
and
resolved
in
my
*NL*
mind
many
different
schemes
for
that
purpose
.
I
first
proposed
to
cut
*NL*
down
my
inclosures
;
and
turn
my
tame
cattle
wild
into
the
woods
that
the
*NL*
enemy
might
not
find
them
,
and
frequent
the
island
in
hopes
of
killing
*NL*
the
same
.
Secondly
,
I
was
for
digging
up
my
corn
fields
for
the
very
*NL*
same
reason
.
An
,
lastly
,
I
concluded
to
demolish
my
bower
,
lest
,
seeing
*NL*
a
place
of
human
contrivance
,
they
might
come
farther
and
find
out
and
*NL*
attack
me
in
my
little
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
notions
did
the
fear
of
danger
suggest
to
me
;
and
I
looked
I
*NL*
thought
like
the
unfortunate
king
Saul
,
when
not
only
oppressed
by
the
*NL*
Philistines
,
but
also
forsaken
by
God
himself
.
And
,
it
is
strange
,
that
*NL*
a
little
before
,
having
entirely
resigned
myself
to
the
will
of
God
,
I
*NL*
should
now
have
little
confidence
in
him
,
fearing
those
more
who
could
*NL*
kill
this
fading
body
,
than
him
who
could
destroy
my
immortal
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sleep
was
an
utter
stranger
to
my
eyes
that
night
:
yet
nature
,
spent
and
*NL*
tired
,
submitted
to
a
silent
repose
the
next
morning
,
and
then
joining
*NL*
reason
with
fear
,
I
considered
that
this
delightful
and
pleasant
island
*NL*
might
not
be
to
entirely
forsaken
as
I
might
think
;
but
that
the
*NL*
inhabitants
from
the
other
shore
might
fail
,
either
with
design
or
from
*NL*
necessity
,
by
cross
winds
;
and
if
the
latter
circumstance
.
I
had
reason
*NL*
to
believe
they
would
depart
the
first
opportunity
.
However
,
my
fear
*NL*
made
me
think
of
a
place
for
retreat
upon
an
attack
.
I
now
repented
that
*NL*
I
had
made
my
door
to
come
out
beyond
my
fortification
;
to
remedy
which
,
*NL*
I
resolved
to
make
me
a
second
one
:
I
fell
to
work
,
therefore
,
and
drove
*NL*
betwixt
that
double
row
of
trees
,
which
I
planted
above
twelve
years
*NL*
before
,
several
strong
piles
,
thickening
it
with
pieces
of
timber
and
*NL*
old
cables
,
and
strengthening
the
foot
of
it
with
earth
which
I
dug
out
*NL*
of
my
cave
;
I
also
made
me
seven
holes
,
wherein
I
planted
my
muskets
*NL*
like
cannon
,
fitting
them
into
frames
resembling
carriages
.
This
being
*NL*
finished
with
indefatigable
industry
,
for
a
great
way
every
where
,
I
*NL*
planted
sticks
of
osier
like
a
wood
,
about
twenty
thousand
of
them
,
*NL*
leaving
a
large
space
between
them
and
my
wall
,
that
I
might
have
room
*NL*
to
see
an
enemy
,
and
that
they
might
not
be
sheltered
among
the
young
*NL*
trees
,
if
they
offered
to
approach
the
outer
wall
.
And
,
indeed
,
scarce
*NL*
two
years
had
passed
over
my
head
,
when
there
appeared
a
lovely
shady
*NL*
grove
,
and
in
six
years
it
became
a
thick
wood
perfectly
impassable
.
For
*NL*
my
safety
,
I
left
no
avenue
to
go
in
or
out
:
instead
of
which
I
set
two
*NL*
ladders
,
one
to
a
part
of
a
rock
which
was
low
,
and
then
broke
in
,
*NL*
leaving
room
to
place
another
ladder
upon
that
;
so
that
when
I
took
*NL*
these
down
,
it
was
impossible
for
any
man
to
descend
without
hurting
*NL*
himself
;
and
if
they
had
,
they
would
still
be
at
the
outside
of
my
outer
*NL*
wall
.
But
while
I
took
all
these
measures
of
human
prudence
for
my
own
*NL*
preservation
I
was
not
altogether
unmindful
of
other
affairs
.
To
*NL*
preserve
my
stock
of
tame
goats
,
that
the
enemy
should
not
take
all
at
*NL*
once
,
I
looked
out
for
the
most
retired
part
of
the
island
,
which
was
*NL*
the
place
where
I
had
lost
myself
before-mentioned
;
and
there
finding
a
*NL*
clear
piece
of
land
,
containing
three
acres
,
surrounded
with
thick
*NL*
woods
,
I
wrought
so
hard
,
that
in
less
than
a
month
's
time
,
I
fenced
it
*NL*
so
well
round
,
that
my
flocks
were
very
well
secured
in
it
,
and
I
put
*NL*
therein
two
he-goats
and
ten
she
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
labour
was
occasioned
purely
by
fearful
apprehensions
,
on
*NL*
account
of
seeing
the
print
of
a
man
's
foot
.
And
not
contented
yet
with
*NL*
what
I
had
done
,
I
searched
for
another
place
towards
the
west
point
of
*NL*
the
island
,
where
I
might
also
retain
another
flock
.
Then
wandering
on
*NL*
this
errand
more
to
the
west
of
the
island
than
ever
I
had
yet
done
,
and
*NL*
casting
my
eyes
towards
the
sea
,
methought
I
perceived
a
boat
at
a
great
*NL*
distance
;
but
could
not
possibly
tell
what
it
was
for
want
of
my
*NL*
perspective
glass
.
I
considered
then
it
was
no
strange
thing
to
see
the
*NL*
print
of
a
man
's
foot
;
and
concluding
them
cannibals
,
blessed
God
for
*NL*
being
cast
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
where
none
of
the
savages
,
*NL*
as
I
thought
,
ever
came
.
But
when
I
came
down
the
hill
to
the
shore
,
*NL*
which
was
the
S.W.
point
of
the
island
,
I
was
soon
confirmed
in
my
*NL*
opinion
;
nor
can
any
one
describe
my
horror
and
amazement
,
when
I
saw
*NL*
the
ground
spread
with
sculls
,
hands
,
feet
,
and
bones
of
human
bodies
;
*NL*
and
particularly
,
I
perceived
a
space
like
a
circle
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
which
had
been
a
fire
,
about
which
I
conjectured
these
wretches
sat
,
and
*NL*
unnaturally
sacrificed
and
devoured
their
fellow
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horror
and
loathsomeness
of
this
dreadful
spectacle
,
both
confounded
*NL*
my
senses
,
and
made
me
discharge
from
my
stomach
in
an
excessive
manner
.
*NL*
I
then
returned
towards
my
habitation
;
and
,
in
my
way
thither
,
shedding
*NL*
floods
of
tears
,
and
falling
down
on
my
bended
knees
,
gave
God
thanks
*NL*
for
making
my
nature
contrary
to
these
wretches
,
and
delivering
me
so
*NL*
long
out
of
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
reason
and
my
long
residence
here
had
assured
me
,
that
these
*NL*
savages
never
came
up
to
the
thick
woody
parts
of
the
country
,
and
that
*NL*
I
had
no
reason
to
be
apprehensive
of
a
discovery
;
yet
such
an
abhorence
*NL*
did
I
still
retain
,
that
,
for
two
years
after
,
I
confined
myself
only
to
*NL*
my
three
plantation
:
I
mean
my
castle
,
country-seat
,
and
inclosure
in
*NL*
the
woods
.
And
though
in
process
of
time
,
my
dreadful
apprehensions
*NL*
began
to
wear
away
,
yet
my
eyes
were
more
vigilant
for
fear
of
being
*NL*
heard
by
those
creatures
,
they
should
proceed
to
attack
me
.
I
resolved
,
*NL*
however
,
manfully
to
lose
my
life
if
they
did
,
and
went
armed
with
three
*NL*
pistols
stuck
in
my
girdle
,
which
added
to
the
description
I
have
given
*NL*
of
myself
before
,
made
me
look
with
a
very
formidable
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
my
circumstances
for
some
time
remained
very
calm
and
undisturbed
;
*NL*
and
when
I
compared
my
condition
to
others
,
I
found
it
far
from
being
*NL*
miserable
.
And
,
indeed
,
would
all
persons
compare
their
circumstances
,
*NL*
not
with
those
above
them
,
but
with
those
innumerable
unhappy
objects
*NL*
beneath
them
,
I
am
sure
we
should
not
hear
these
daily
murmurings
and
*NL*
complainings
that
are
in
the
world
.
For
my
part
,
I
wanted
but
few
*NL*
things
.
Indeed
,
the
terror
which
the
savages
had
put
me
in
,
spoiled
some
*NL*
inventions
for
my
own
conveniences
.
One
of
my
projects
was
to
brew
me
*NL*
some
beer
;
a
very
whimsical
one
indeed
,
when
it
is
considered
that
I
had
*NL*
neither
casks
sufficient
;
nor
could
I
make
any
to
preserve
it
in
;
*NL*
neither
had
I
hops
to
make
it
keep
,
yest
to
make
it
work
,
nor
a
copper
*NL*
or
kettle
to
make
it
boil
.
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
after
some
years
,
I
might
*NL*
bring
this
to
bear
,
as
I
had
done
other
things
.
But
now
my
inventions
*NL*
were
placed
another
way
;
and
day
and
night
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
*NL*
how
I
might
destroy
some
of
these
cannibals
,
when
proceeding
to
their
*NL*
bloody
entertainments
;
and
so
saving
a
victim
from
being
sacrificed
,
*NL*
that
he
might
after
become
my
servant
.
Many
were
my
contrivances
after
*NL*
this
purpose
,
and
as
many
more
objections
occurred
after
I
hatched
them
.
*NL*
I
once
contrived
to
dig
a
hole
under
the
place
where
they
made
their
*NL*
fire
,
and
put
therein
five
or
six
pounds
of
gunpowder
,
which
would
*NL*
consequently
blow
up
all
those
that
were
near
it
:
but
then
I
was
loth
to
*NL*
spend
so
much
upon
them
,
lest
it
should
not
do
that
certain
execution
I
*NL*
could
desire
,
&
but
only
affright
&
not
kill
them
.
Having
laid
this
*NL*
design
aside
,
I
again
proposed
to
myself
to
lie
privately
in
ambush
,
in
*NL*
some
convenient
place
,
with
my
three
guns
double
loaded
,
and
let
fly
at
*NL*
them
in
the
midst
of
their
dreadful
ceremony
:
and
having
killed
two
or
*NL*
three
of
them
at
every
shot
,
fall
upon
the
rest
suddenly
with
my
three
*NL*
pistols
,
&
not
let
one
mother
's
son
escape
.
Thus
imagination
pleased
my
*NL*
fancy
so
much
that
I
used
to
dream
of
it
in
the
night
time
.
To
put
my
*NL*
design
in
execution
,
I
was
not
long
in
seeking
for
a
place
convenient
*NL*
for
my
purpose
,
where
unseen
I
might
behold
every
action
of
the
savages
.
*NL*
Here
I
placed
my
two
muskets
,
each
of
which
was
loaded
with
a
brace
of
*NL*
slugs
,
and
four
or
five
smaller
bullets
about
the
size
of
pistol
*NL*
bullets
;
the
fowling-piece
was
charged
with
near
a
handful
of
the
*NL*
largest
swan-shot
,
and
in
every
pistol
were
about
four
bullets
.
And
thus
*NL*
all
things
being
prepared
,
no
sooner
would
the
welcome
light
spread
over
*NL*
the
element
,
but
,
_
like
a
giant
refreshed
with
wine
_
,
as
the
Scripture
*NL*
has
it
,
would
I
issue
forth
from
my
castle
,
and
from
a
lofty
hill
,
three
*NL*
miles
distant
,
view
if
I
could
see
any
invaders
approach
unlawfully
to
*NL*
my
kingdom
.
But
having
waited
in
vain
two
or
three
months
,
it
not
only
*NL*
grew
very
tiresome
to
me
,
but
brought
me
to
some
consideration
,
and
*NL*
made
me
examine
myself
,
what
right
I
had
to
kill
these
creatures
in
*NL*
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
-LRB-
argued
I
to
myself
-RRB-
this
unnatural
custom
of
theirs
be
a
sin
*NL*
offensive
to
Heaven
,
it
belongs
to
the
Divine
Being
,
who
alone
has
the
*NL*
vindictive
power
in
his
hands
,
to
shower
down
his
vengeance
upon
them
.
*NL*
And
perhaps
he
does
so
,
in
making
them
become
one
another
's
*NL*
executioners
.
Or
,
if
not
,
if
God
thinks
these
doings
just
,
according
to
*NL*
the
knowledge
they
conceive
,
what
authority
have
I
to
pretend
to
thwart
*NL*
the
decrees
of
Providence
,
which
has
permitted
these
actions
for
so
many
*NL*
ages
,
perhaps
from
almost
the
beginning
of
the
creation
?
They
never
*NL*
offended
me
,
what
right
have
I
then
to
concern
myself
in
their
shedding
*NL*
one
another
's
blood
:
And
,
indeed
,
I
have
since
known
,
they
value
no
more
*NL*
to
kill
and
devour
a
captive
taken
in
war
,
than
we
do
to
kill
an
ox
or
*NL*
eat
mutton
.
I
then
concluded
it
necessarily
followed
,
that
these
people
*NL*
were
no
more
murderers
than
Christians
,
who
many
times
put
whole
troops
*NL*
to
the
sword
,
after
throwing
down
their
arms
.
--
Again
I
considered
,
that
*NL*
if
I
fell
upon
them
,
I
should
be
as
much
in
the
wrong
as
the
Spaniards
,
*NL*
who
had
committed
the
greatest
barbarities
upon
these
people
who
had
*NL*
never
offended
them
in
their
whole
lives
;
as
if
the
kingdom
of
Spain
was
*NL*
eminent
for
a
race
of
men
without
common
compassion
to
the
miserable
,
a
*NL*
principal
sign
of
the
most
generous
temper
:
these
considerations
made
me
*NL*
pause
,
and
made
me
think
I
had
taken
wrong
measures
in
my
resolution
:
I
*NL*
now
argued
with
myself
,
it
was
better
for
me
never
to
attack
,
but
to
*NL*
remain
undiscovered
as
long
as
I
possibly
could
;
that
an
opposite
*NL*
conduct
would
certainly
prove
destructive
;
for
as
it
was
scarcely
to
be
*NL*
supposed
I
could
kill
them
all
,
I
might
either
be
overpowered
by
the
*NL*
remaining
,
or
that
some
escaping
,
might
bring
thousands
to
my
certain
*NL*
destruction
.
And
,
indeed
,
religion
took
their
part
so
much
as
to
*NL*
convince
me
how
contrary
it
was
to
my
duty
to
be
guilty
of
shedding
*NL*
human
blood
,
innocent
as
to
my
particular
,
whatever
they
are
to
one
*NL*
another
:
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
but
leave
it
to
the
God
of
*NL*
all
power
and
dominion
,
as
I
said
before
,
to
do
therein
what
seemed
*NL*
convenient
to
his
heavenly
wisdom
.
And
,
therefore
,
on
my
knees
I
thanked
*NL*
the
Almighty
for
delivering
me
from
blood
guiltiness
,
and
begged
his
*NL*
protection
that
I
might
never
fall
into
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
giving
over
an
attempt
which
I
had
rashly
begun
,
I
never
ascended
*NL*
the
hill
on
that
occasion
afterwards
:
I
only
re-removed
my
boat
,
which
*NL*
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
and
every
thing
that
belonged
to
*NL*
her
,
towards
the
east
,
into
a
little
cove
;
that
there
might
not
be
the
*NL*
least
shadow
of
any
boat
near
,
or
habitation
upon
the
island
.
--
My
castle
*NL*
then
became
my
cell
,
keeping
always
retired
in
it
,
except
when
I
went
*NL*
out
to
milk
my
she-goats
,
and
order
my
little
flock
in
the
wood
,
which
*NL*
was
quite
out
of
danger
:
for
sure
I
was
that
these
savages
never
came
*NL*
here
with
expectations
to
find
any
thing
,
consequently
never
wandered
*NL*
from
the
coast
;
however
,
as
they
might
have
several
times
been
on
shore
,
*NL*
as
well
before
as
after
my
dreadful
apprehensions
,
I
looked
back
with
*NL*
horror
to
think
in
what
state
I
might
have
been
,
had
I
suddenly
met
them
*NL*
slenderly
armed
;
with
one
gun
only
loaded
with
small
shot
;
and
how
great
*NL*
would
have
been
my
amazement
,
if
,
instead
of
seeing
the
print
of
one
*NL*
man
's
foot
,
I
had
perceived
fifteen
,
or
twenty
savages
,
who
having
once
*NL*
set
their
eyes
upon
me
,
by
the
swiftness
of
their
feet
would
have
left
*NL*
me
no
possibility
of
escaping
?
These
thoughts
would
sink
my
very
soul
,
*NL*
so
that
I
would
fall
into
a
deep
melancholy
,
till
such
time
as
the
*NL*
consideration
of
my
gratitude
to
the
Divine
Being
moved
it
from
my
*NL*
heart
.
I
then
fell
into
a
contemplation
of
the
secret
springs
of
*NL*
Providence
,
and
how
wonderfully
we
are
delivered
,
when
insensible
of
it
;
*NL*
and
when
intricated
in
uncertain
mazes
or
labyrinths
of
doubt
or
*NL*
hesitation
,
what
secret
hint
directs
us
in
the
right
way
,
when
we
*NL*
intended
to
go
out
of
it
,
nay
,
perhaps
contrary
to
our
business
,
sense
*NL*
or
inclination
.
Upon
which
,
I
fixed
within
me
this
as
a
certain
rule
,
*NL*
never
to
disobey
those
secret
impressions
of
the
mind
,
to
the
acting
or
*NL*
not
acting
any
thing
that
offered
,
for
which
I
yet
could
assign
no
*NL*
reason
.
But
let
it
be
how
it
will
,
the
advantage
of
this
conduct
very
*NL*
eminently
appeared
in
the
latter
part
of
my
abode
on
this
island
;
I
am
,
*NL*
a
stranger
in
determining
whence
these
secret
intimations
of
Providence
*NL*
derive
;
yet
methinks
they
are
not
only
some
proof
of
the
converse
of
*NL*
spirits
,
but
also
of
the
secret
communications
they
are
supposed
to
have
*NL*
with
those
that
have
not
passed
through
the
gloomy
vale
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
anxieties
of
mind
,
and
the
care
of
my
preservation
,
put
a
period
*NL*
to
all
future
inventions
and
contrivances
,
either
for
accommodation
or
*NL*
convenience
.
I
now
cared
not
to
drive
a
nail
,
chop
a
stick
,
fire
a
gun
*NL*
or
make
a
fire
,
lest
either
the
noise
should
be
heard
,
or
the
smoke
*NL*
discover
me
.
And
on
this
account
I
used
to
burn
my
earthen
ware
*NL*
privately
in
a
cave
which
I
found
in
the
wood
,
and
which
I
made
*NL*
convenient
for
that
purpose
;
the
principal
cause
that
brought
me
here
*NL*
was
to
make
charcoal
,
so
that
I
might
bake
and
dress
my
bread
and
meat
*NL*
without
any
danger
.
At
that
time
a
curious
accident
happened
me
,
which
I
*NL*
shall
now
relate
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
cutting
down
some
wood
for
making
my
charcoal
,
I
perceived
a
*NL*
cavity
behind
a
very
thick
branch
of
underwood
.
Curious
to
look
into
it
,
*NL*
I
attained
its
month
,
and
perceived
it
sufficient
for
me
to
stand
*NL*
upright
in
.
But
when
I
had
entered
,
and
took
a
further
view
,
two
rolling
*NL*
shining
eyes
like
flaming
stars
seemed
to
dart
themselves
at
me
;
so
that
*NL*
I
made
all
the
haste
out
that
I
could
,
as
not
knowing
whither
it
was
the
*NL*
devil
or
a
monster
that
had
taken
his
residence
in
that
place
.
When
I
*NL*
recovered
a
little
from
my
surprise
,
I
called
myself
a
thousand
fools
,
*NL*
for
being
afraid
to
see
the
devil
one
moment
,
who
had
now
lived
almost
*NL*
twenty
years
in
the
most
retired
solitude
.
And
therefore
resuming
all
*NL*
the
courage
I
had
,
I
took
a
flaming
firebrand
,
and
in
I
rushed
again
.
I
*NL*
had
not
proceeded
above
three
steps
,
when
I
was
more
affrighted
than
*NL*
before
;
for
then
I
heard
a
very
loud
sigh
,
like
that
of
a
human
creature
*NL*
in
the
greatest
agony
,
succeeded
with
a
broken
noise
,
resembling
words
*NL*
half
expressed
,
and
then
a
broken
sigh
again
.
Stepping
back
,
_
Lord
!
_
*NL*
-LRB-
thought
I
to
myself
-RRB-
_
where
am
I
got
,
into
what
enchanted
place
have
I
*NL*
plunged
myself
,
such
as
are
reported
to
contain
miserable
captives
,
till
*NL*
death
puts
an
end
to
their
sorrow
_
?
And
,
indeed
,
in
such
great
amazement
*NL*
was
I
,
that
it
struck
me
into
a
cold
sweat
;
and
had
my
hat
been
on
my
*NL*
head
,
I
believe
my
hair
would
have
moved
it
off
.
But
again
encouraging
*NL*
myself
with
the
hopes
of
God
's
protection
,
I
proceeded
forward
,
and
,
by
*NL*
the
light
of
my
firebrand
,
perceived
it
to
be
a
monstrous
he-goat
,
lying
*NL*
on
the
ground
,
gasping
for
life
,
and
dying
of
mere
old
age
.
At
first
,
I
*NL*
stirred
him
,
thinking
to
drive
him
out
,
but
the
poor
ancient
creature
*NL*
strove
to
get
upon
his
feet
,
but
was
not
able
;
so
I
e
`
en
let
him
lie
*NL*
still
to
affright
the
savages
,
should
they
venture
into
this
cave
.
I
now
*NL*
looked
round
me
and
found
the
place
but
small
and
shapeless
.
At
the
*NL*
farther
side
of
it
,
I
perceived
a
sort
of
an
entrance
,
yet
so
low
,
as
*NL*
must
oblige
me
to
creep
upon
my
hands
and
knees
to
it
;
so
,
having
no
*NL*
candle
,
I
suspended
my
enterprise
till
the
next
day
,
and
then
I
came
*NL*
provided
with
two
large
ones
of
my
own
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
crept
upon
my
hands
and
feet
,
through
this
strait
,
I
found
the
*NL*
roof
higher
up
,
I
think
about
twenty
feet
.
But
surely
mortal
never
saw
*NL*
such
a
glorious
sight
before
!
The
roof
and
walls
of
this
cave
reflected
*NL*
a
hundred
thousand
lights
to
me
from
my
two
candles
,
as
though
they
were
*NL*
indented
with
mining
gold
,
precious
stones
,
or
sparkling
diamonds
.
And
*NL*
indeed
it
was
the
most
delightful
cavity
or
grotto
of
its
kind
that
*NL*
could
be
desired
,
though
entirely
dark
.
The
floor
was
dry
and
level
,
and
*NL*
had
a
kind
of
gravel
upon
it
:
no
nauseous
venomous
creatures
to
be
seen
*NL*
there
,
neither
any
damp
or
wet
about
it
.
I
could
find
no
fault
but
in
*NL*
the
entrance
,
and
I
began
to
think
that
even
this
might
be
very
*NL*
necessary
for
my
defence
,
and
therefore
resolved
to
make
it
my
most
*NL*
principal
magazine
.
I
brought
hither
two
fowling-pieces
,
and
three
*NL*
muskets
,
leaving
only
five
pieces
at
my
castle
,
planted
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
cannon
.
Of
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
,
which
I
took
up
out
of
the
sea
,
I
*NL*
brought
away
about
sixty
pounds
powder
,
which
was
not
damaged
,
and
this
*NL*
with
a
great
quantity
of
lead
for
bullets
,
I
removed
for
my
castle
to
*NL*
this
retreat
,
now
fortified
both
by
art
and
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fancied
myself
now
like
one
of
the
giants
of
old
,
who
were
said
to
*NL*
live
in
caves
and
holes
among
the
rocks
,
inaccessible
to
any
but
*NL*
themselves
,
or
,
at
lest
,
a
most
dangerous
to
attempt
.
And
now
I
despised
*NL*
both
the
cunning
and
strength
of
the
savages
,
either
to
find
me
out
or
*NL*
to
hurt
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
not
forget
the
old
goat
,
which
caused
my
late
dreadful
*NL*
amazement
.
The
poor
creature
gave
up
the
ghost
the
day
after
my
*NL*
discovery
;
&
it
being
difficult
to
drag
him
out
,
I
dug
his
gave
,
and
*NL*
honourably
entombed
him
in
the
same
place
where
is
departed
,
with
as
*NL*
much
ceremony
as
any
Welch
goat
that
has
been
interred
about
the
high
*NL*
mountain
Penmanmawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
was
now
in
the
twenty-third
year
of
my
reign
,
and
my
thoughts
*NL*
much
easier
than
formerly
,
having
contrived
several
pretty
amusements
*NL*
and
diversions
to
pass
away
the
time
in
a
pleasant
manner
.
By
this
time
*NL*
my
pretty
Poll
had
learned
to
speak
English
,
and
pronounce
his
words
*NL*
very
articulately
and
plain
;
so
that
for
many
hours
we
used
to
chat
*NL*
together
after
a
familiar
manner
,
and
he
lived
with
me
no
less
than
*NL*
twenty-six
years
.
My
dog
which
was
nineteen
years
old
,
sixteen
of
which
*NL*
he
lived
with
me
,
died
some
time
ago
of
mere
old
age
.
As
for
my
cats
,
*NL*
they
multiplied
so
fast
,
that
I
was
forced
to
kill
or
drive
them
into
*NL*
the
woods
,
except
two
or
three
which
became
my
particular
favourites
.
*NL*
Besides
these
,
I
continually
kept
two
or
three
household
kids
about
me
,
*NL*
which
I
learned
to
feed
out
of
my
hand
,
and
two
more
parrots
which
could
*NL*
talk
indifferently
,
and
call
_
Robinson
Crusoe
_
,
but
not
so
excellently
*NL*
as
the
first
,
as
not
taking
that
pains
with
them
.
I
had
also
several
*NL*
sea-owls
which
I
had
wounded
and
cut
their
wings
;
and
growing
tame
,
they
*NL*
used
to
breed
among
the
low
trees
about
my
castle
walls
,
all
which
made
*NL*
my
abode
very
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
unforeseen
events
suddenly
destroy
the
enjoyment
,
of
this
*NL*
uncertain
state
of
life
,
when
we
least
expect
them
!
it
was
now
the
month
*NL*
of
December
,
in
the
southern
solstice
,
and
particular
time
of
my
*NL*
harvest
,
which
required
my
attendance
in
the
fields
;
when
going
out
*NL*
pretty
early
one
morning
,
before
it
was
day-light
,
there
appeared
to
me
,
*NL*
from
the
sea
shore
,
a
flaming
light
,
about
two
miles
from
me
at
the
east
*NL*
end
of
the
island
,
where
I
had
observed
some
savages
had
been
before
,
*NL*
not
on
the
other
side
,
but
to
my
great
affliction
,
it
was
on
my
side
*NL*
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Struck
with
a
terrible
surprise
,
and
my
usual
apprehensions
,
that
the
*NL*
savages
would
perceive
my
improvements
,
I
returned
directly
to
my
*NL*
castle
,
pulled
the
ladder
after
me
,
making
all
things
look
as
wild
and
*NL*
natural
as
I
possibly
could
.
In
the
next
place
,
I
put
myself
into
a
*NL*
posture
of
defence
,
loading
my
mussels
and
pistols
,
and
committing
*NL*
myself
to
God
's
protection
,
I
resolved
to
defend
myself
till
my
last
*NL*
breath
.
Two
hours
after
,
impatient
for
intelligence
,
I
set
my
ladder
up
*NL*
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
where
there
was
a
flat
place
,
and
then
pulling
*NL*
the
ladder
after
me
ascended
to
the
top
,
where
laying
myself
on
my
*NL*
belly
,
with
my
perspective
glass
,
I
perceived
no
less
than
nine
naked
*NL*
savages
,
sitting
round
a
small
fire
,
eating
,
as
I
supposed
human
flesh
,
*NL*
with
their
two
canoes
haled
on
shore
,
waiting
for
the
flood
to
carry
*NL*
them
off
again
.
You
can
not
easily
express
the
consternation
I
was
in
at
*NL*
this
sight
,
especially
seeing
them
near
me
;
but
when
I
perceived
their
*NL*
coming
must
be
always
with
the
current
of
the
ebb
,
I
became
more
easy
in
*NL*
my
thoughts
,
being
fully
convinced
that
I
might
go
abroad
with
security
*NL*
all
the
time
of
flood
,
if
they
were
not
before
landed
.
And
,
indeed
,
this
*NL*
proved
just
as
I
imagined
;
for
no
sooner
did
they
all
take
boat
and
*NL*
paddle
away
,
but
the
tide
made
N.W.
Before
they
went
off
they
danced
,
*NL*
making
ridiculous
postures
and
gestures
for
above
an
hour
,
all
stark
*NL*
naked
;
but
whether
men
or
women
,
or
both
,
I
could
not
perceive
.
When
I
*NL*
saw
them
gone
,
I
took
two
guns
upon
my
shoulders
,
and
placing
a
couple
*NL*
of
pistols
in
my
belt
,
with
my
great
sword
hanging
by
my
side
,
I
went
to
*NL*
the
hill
,
where
at
first
I
made
a
discovery
of
these
cannibals
,
and
then
*NL*
saw
there
had
been
three
canoes
more
of
the
savages
on
shore
at
that
*NL*
place
,
which
with
the
rest
were
making
over
to
the
main
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
nothing
could
be
more
horrid
to
me
,
when
going
to
the
place
of
*NL*
sacrifice
,
the
blood
,
the
bones
,
and
other
mangled
parts
of
human
bodies
*NL*
appeared
in
my
sight
;
and
so
fired
was
I
with
indignation
,
that
I
was
*NL*
fully
resolved
to
be
revenged
on
the
first
that
came
there
,
though
I
*NL*
lost
my
life
in
the
execution
.
It
then
appeared
to
me
,
that
the
visits
*NL*
which
they
make
to
this
island
are
not
very
frequent
,
it
being
fifteen
*NL*
months
before
they
came
again
;
but
still
I
was
very
uneasy
,
by
reason
of
*NL*
the
dismal
apprehensions
of
their
surprising
me
unawares
;
nor
dared
I
*NL*
offer
to
fire
a
gun
on
that
side
of
the
island
where
they
used
to
*NL*
appear
,
lest
,
taking
the
alarm
,
the
savages
might
return
with
many
*NL*
hundred
canoes
,
and
then
God
knows
in
what
manner
I
should
have
made
my
*NL*
end
.
Thus
was
I
a
year
or
more
before
I
saw
any
of
these
devouring
*NL*
cannibals
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
wave
this
,
the
following
accident
,
which
demands
attention
,
for
a
*NL*
while
eluded
the
force
of
my
thoughts
in
revenging
myself
on
*NL*
those
Heathens
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
16th
of
May
-LRB-
according
to
my
wooden
calendar
-RRB-
the
wind
blew
*NL*
exceedingly
hard
,
accompanied
with
abundance
of
lightning
and
thunder
*NL*
all
day
,
and
succeeded
by
a
very
stormy
night
.
The
seeming
anger
of
the
*NL*
Heavens
made
me
have
recourse
to
my
Bible
.
While
I
was
seriously
*NL*
pondering
upon
it
,
I
was
suddenly
alarmed
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
,
which
*NL*
I
conjectured
was
fired
upon
the
ocean
.
Such
an
unusual
surprise
made
me
*NL*
start
up
in
a
minute
,
when
,
with
my
ladder
,
ascending
the
mountain
as
*NL*
before
,
that
very
moment
a
flash
of
fire
presaged
the
report
of
another
*NL*
gun
which
I
presently
heard
,
and
found
it
was
from
that
part
of
the
sea
*NL*
where
the
current
drove
me
away
.
I
could
not
but
then
think
,
that
this
*NL*
must
be
a
ship
in
distress
,
and
that
there
were
the
melancholy
signals
*NL*
for
a
speedy
deliverance
.
Great
,
indeed
,
was
my
sorrow
upon
this
*NL*
occasion
;
but
my
labours
to
assist
them
must
have
proved
altogether
vain
*NL*
&
fruitless
.
However
,
I
brought
together
all
the
dry
wood
that
was
at
*NL*
hand
,
and
making
a
pretty
large
pile
,
set
it
on
fire
on
the
hill
.
I
was
*NL*
certain
they
plainly
perceived
it
,
by
their
firing
another
gun
as
soon
*NL*
as
it
began
to
blaze
,
and
after
that
several
more
from
the
same
quarter
.
*NL*
All
night
long
I
kept
up
my
fire
:
and
when
the
air
cleared
up
,
I
*NL*
perceived
something
a
great
way
at
sea
,
directly
E.
but
could
not
*NL*
distinguish
what
it
was
,
even
with
my
glass
,
by
reason
that
the
weather
*NL*
was
so
very
foggy
out
at
sea
.
However
,
keeping
my
eyes
directly
fixed
*NL*
upon
it
,
and
perceiving
it
did
not
stir
,
I
presently
concluded
it
must
*NL*
be
a
ship
at
anchor
,
and
so
very
hasty
I
was
to
be
satisfied
,
that
*NL*
taking
the
gun
,
I
went
to
the
S.E.
part
of
the
island
,
to
the
same
rocks
*NL*
where
I
had
been
formerly
drove
away
by
the
current
,
in
which
time
the
*NL*
weather
being
perfectly
cleared
up
,
to
my
great
sorrow
,
I
perceived
the
*NL*
wreck
of
a
ship
cast
away
upon
those
hidden
rocks
I
found
when
I
was
out
*NL*
with
my
boat
;
and
which
,
by
making
a
kind
of
an
eddy
,
were
the
occasion
*NL*
of
my
preservation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
_
what
is
one
man
's
safety
is
another
's
ruin
_
;
for
undoubtedly
this
*NL*
ship
had
been
driven
on
them
in
the
night
,
the
wind
blowing
strong
at
*NL*
E.N.E.
Had
they
perceived
the
island
,
as
I
now
guessed
they
had
not
,
*NL*
certainly
,
instead
of
firing
there
guns
for
help
,
they
would
rather
have
*NL*
ventured
in
their
boat
and
saved
themselves
that
way
.
I
then
thought
,
*NL*
that
perhaps
they
had
done
so
,
upon
seeing
my
fire
,
and
were
cast
away
*NL*
in
the
attempt
:
for
I
perceived
no
boat
in
the
ship
.
But
then
I
again
*NL*
imagined
,
that
,
perhaps
,
they
had
another
vessel
in
company
,
which
,
upon
*NL*
signal
,
saved
their
lives
,
and
took
the
boat
up
:
or
that
the
boat
might
*NL*
be
driven
into
the
main
ocean
,
where
these
poor
creatures
might
be
in
*NL*
the
most
miserable
condition
.
But
as
all
these
conjectures
were
very
*NL*
uncertain
,
I
could
do
no
more
than
commiserate
there
distress
,
and
thank
*NL*
God
for
delivering
me
,
in
particular
,
when
so
many
perished
in
the
*NL*
raging
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
considered
seriously
every
thing
concerning
this
wreck
,
and
could
*NL*
perceive
no
room
to
suppose
any
of
them
saved
,
I
can
not
explain
,
by
any
*NL*
possible
force
of
words
,
what
longings
my
soul
felt
on
this
occasion
,
*NL*
often
breaking
out
in
this
manner
:
_
O
that
there
had
been
but
two
or
*NL*
three
,
nay
even
one
person
saved
,
that
we
might
have
lived
together
,
*NL*
conversed
with
,
and
comforted
one
another
!
_
and
so
much
were
my
desires
*NL*
moved
,
that
when
I
repeated
these
words
,
_
Oh
!
that
there
had
been
but
*NL*
one
!
_
my
hands
would
clench
together
,
and
my
fingers
press
the
palms
of
*NL*
my
hands
to
close
,
that
,
had
any
soft
thing
been
between
,
it
would
have
*NL*
crushed
it
involuntarily
,
while
my
teeth
would
strike
together
,
and
set
*NL*
against
each
other
so
strong
that
it
required
some
time
for
me
to
*NL*
part
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
the
last
year
of
my
being
on
this
island
,
I
never
knew
whether
or
*NL*
not
any
had
been
saved
out
of
this
ship
.
I
had
the
affliction
,
some
time
*NL*
after
,
to
see
the
corpse
of
a
drowned
boy
come
on
shore
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
island
which
was
next
the
shipwreck
;
there
was
nothing
on
him
but
a
*NL*
seaman
's
waistcoat
,
a
pair
of
opened
kneed
linen
drawers
,
and
a
blue
*NL*
linen
shirt
,
but
no
particular
mark
to
guess
what
nation
he
was
of
.
In
*NL*
his
pocket
were
two
pieces
of
eight
,
and
a
tobacco-pipe
,
the
last
of
*NL*
which
I
preferred
much
more
than
I
did
the
first
.
And
now
the
calmness
*NL*
of
the
sea
tempted
me
to
venture
out
in
my
boat
to
this
wreck
,
not
only
*NL*
to
get
something
necessary
out
of
the
ship
,
but
perhaps
,
some
living
*NL*
creature
might
be
on
board
,
whose
life
I
might
preserve
.
This
had
such
*NL*
an
influence
upon
my
mind
,
that
immediately
I
went
home
,
and
prepared
*NL*
every
thing
necessary
for
the
voyage
,
carrying
on
board
my
boat
*NL*
provisions
of
all
sorts
,
with
a
good
quantity
of
rum
,
fresh
water
,
and
a
*NL*
compass
:
so
putting
off
,
I
paddled
the
canoe
along
the
shore
,
till
I
*NL*
came
at
last
to
the
north-east
part
of
the
island
,
from
whence
I
was
to
*NL*
launch
into
the
ocean
;
but
here
the
currents
ran
so
violently
,
and
*NL*
appeared
so
terrible
,
that
my
heart
began
to
fail
me
;
foreseeing
that
if
*NL*
I
was
driven
into
any
of
these
currents
,
I
might
be
carried
not
only
out
*NL*
of
reach
or
sight
of
the
island
,
but
even
inevitably
lost
in
the
boiling
*NL*
surges
of
the
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
oppressed
was
I
at
these
troubles
,
that
I
gave
over
my
enterprize
,
*NL*
sailing
to
a
little
creek
on
the
shore
,
where
stepping
out
,
I
set
me
*NL*
down
on
a
rising
hill
,
very
pensive
and
thoughtful
.
I
then
perceived
*NL*
that
the
tide
was
turned
;
and
the
flood
came
on
,
which
made
it
*NL*
impracticable
for
me
to
go
out
for
so
many
hours
.
To
be
more
certain
how
*NL*
the
sets
of
the
tides
or
currents
lay
when
the
flood
came
in
,
I
ascended
*NL*
a
higher
piece
of
ground
,
which
overlooked
the
sea
both
ways
;
and
here
I
*NL*
found
that
as
the
current
of
the
ebb
set
out
close
by
the
south
point
of
*NL*
the
island
,
so
the
current
of
the
flood
set
in
close
by
the
shore
of
the
*NL*
north
side
;
and
all
that
I
had
to
do
was
to
keep
to
the
north
of
the
*NL*
island
in
my
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
reposed
myself
in
my
canoe
,
covered
with
my
watch
coat
,
*NL*
instead
of
a
blanket
,
the
heavens
being
my
tester
.
I
set
out
with
the
*NL*
first
of
the
tide
full
north
,
till
I
felt
the
benefit
of
the
current
,
*NL*
which
carried
me
at
a
great
rate
eastward
,
yet
not
with
such
impetuosity
*NL*
as
before
,
as
to
take
from
me
all
government
of
my
canoe
;
so
that
in
two
*NL*
hours
time
I
came
up
to
the
wreck
,
which
appeared
to
me
a
most
*NL*
melancholy
sight
.
It
seemed
to
be
a
Spanish
vessel
by
its
building
,
*NL*
stuck
fast
between
two
rocks
;
her
stern
and
quarter
beaten
to
pieces
by
*NL*
the
sea
;
her
mainmast
and
foremast
were
brought
off
by
the
board
,
that
*NL*
is
broken
off
short
.
As
I
approached
near
,
I
perceived
a
dog
on
board
,
*NL*
who
seeing
me
coming
,
yelped
and
cried
,
and
no
sooner
did
I
call
him
,
*NL*
but
the
poor
creature
jumped
into
the
sea
,
out
of
which
I
took
him
up
,
*NL*
almost
famished
with
hunger
and
thirst
;
so
that
when
I
gave
him
a
cake
*NL*
of
bread
,
no
ravenous
wolf
could
devour
it
more
greedily
;
and
he
drank
*NL*
to
that
degree
of
fresh
water
,
that
he
would
have
burst
himself
,
had
I
*NL*
suffered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
sight
I
met
with
in
the
ship
,
were
two
men
drowned
in
the
*NL*
cook-room
or
forecastle
,
inclosed
in
one
another
's
arms
:
hence
I
very
*NL*
probably
supposed
,
that
_
when
the
vessel
struck
in
the
storm
,
so
high
*NL*
and
incessantly
did
the
waters
break
in
and
over
her
,
that
the
men
not
*NL*
being
able
to
bear
it
,
were
strangled
by
the
constant
rushing
in
of
the
*NL*
waves
_
.
There
were
several
casks
of
liquor
,
whether
wine
of
brandy
,
I
*NL*
could
not
be
positive
,
which
lay
in
the
lower
hold
,
as
were
plainly
*NL*
perceptible
by
the
ebbing
out
of
the
water
,
yet
were
too
large
for
me
to
*NL*
pretend
to
meddle
with
;
likewise
I
perceived
several
chests
,
which
I
*NL*
supposed
to
belong
to
the
seamen
,
two
of
which
I
got
into
my
boat
,
*NL*
without
examining
what
was
in
them
.
Had
the
stern
of
the
ship
been
*NL*
fixed
,
and
the
forepart
broken
off
,
I
should
have
made
a
very
prosperous
*NL*
voyage
;
since
by
what
I
after
found
in
these
two
chests
,
I
could
not
*NL*
otherwise
conclude
,
but
that
the
ship
must
have
abundance
of
wealth
on
*NL*
board
;
nay
,
if
I
must
guess
by
the
course
she
steered
,
she
must
have
*NL*
been
bound
from
the
Buenos
Ayres
,
or
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
,
in
the
*NL*
southern
parts
of
America
,
beyond
the
Brazils
,
to
the
Havannah
,
in
the
*NL*
gulf
of
Mexico
,
and
so
perhaps
to
Spain
.
What
became
of
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
sailors
,
I
could
not
certainly
tell
;
and
all
her
riches
signified
*NL*
nothing
at
that
time
to
any
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Searching
farther
,
I
found
a
cask
containing
about
twenty
gallons
,
full
*NL*
of
liquor
,
which
,
with
some
labour
,
I
got
into
my
boat
;
in
her
cabin
*NL*
were
several
muskets
,
which
I
let
remain
there
;
but
took
away
with
me
a
*NL*
great
powder
horn
,
with
about
four
pounds
of
powder
in
it
.
I
took
also
a
*NL*
fire-shovel
and
tongs
,
two
brass
kettles
,
a
copper
pot
to
make
*NL*
chocolate
,
and
a
gridiron
;
all
which
were
extremely
necessary
to
me
,
*NL*
especially
the
fire-shovel
and
tongs
.
And
so
with
this
cargo
,
*NL*
accompanied
with
my
dog
,
I
came
away
,
the
tide
serving
for
that
purpose
;
*NL*
and
the
same
evening
,
about
an
hour
within
night
,
I
attained
the
island
,
*NL*
after
the
greatest
toil
and
fatigue
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
reposed
my
wearied
limbs
in
the
boat
,
resolving
the
next
*NL*
morning
to
harbour
what
I
had
gotten
in
my
new-found
subterraneous
*NL*
grotto
;
&
not
to
carry
my
cargo
home
to
my
ancient
castle
.
Having
*NL*
refreshed
myself
,
and
got
all
my
effects
on
shore
I
next
proceeded
to
*NL*
examine
the
particulars
;
and
so
tapping
the
cask
,
I
found
the
liquor
to
*NL*
be
a
kind
of
rum
,
but
not
like
what
we
had
at
the
Brazils
,
non
indeed
*NL*
near
so
good
.
At
the
opening
of
the
chest
,
several
things
appeared
very
*NL*
useful
to
me
;
for
instance
,
I
found
in
one
a
very
fine
case
of
bottles
,
*NL*
containing
the
finest
and
best
sorts
of
cordial
waters
;
each
bottle
held
*NL*
about
three
pints
,
curiously
tip
with
silver
.
I
found
also
two
pots
full
*NL*
of
the
choicest
sweetmeats
,
and
two
more
which
the
water
had
utterly
*NL*
spoiled
.
There
were
likewise
several
good
shirts
exceedingly
welcome
to
*NL*
me
,
and
about
one
dozen
and
a
half
white
linen
handkerchiefs
and
*NL*
coloured
neckcloths
,
the
former
of
which
was
absolutely
necessary
for
*NL*
wiping
my
face
in
a
hot
day
;
and
,
in
the
till
,
I
found
three
bags
of
*NL*
pieces
of
eight
,
about
eleven
hundred
in
all
,
in
one
of
which
,
decently
*NL*
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
were
six
doubloons
of
gold
,
and
some
*NL*
small
bars
and
wedges
of
the
same
metal
,
which
I
believe
might
weigh
*NL*
near
a
pound
.
In
the
other
chest
,
which
I
guessed
to
belong
to
the
*NL*
gunner
's
mate
,
by
the
mean
circumstances
which
attended
it
,
I
found
only
*NL*
some
clothes
of
very
little
value
,
except
about
two
pounds
of
fine
*NL*
glazed
powder
,
in
three
flasks
,
kept
,
as
I
believe
,
for
charging
their
*NL*
fowling
pieces
on
any
occasion
;
so
that
,
on
the
whole
,
I
had
no
great
*NL*
advantage
by
this
voyage
.
The
money
was
indeed
as
mere
dirt
to
me
,
*NL*
useless
and
unprofitable
,
all
which
I
would
freely
have
parted
with
for
*NL*
two
or
three
pair
of
English
shoes
and
stockings
;
things
that
for
many
*NL*
years
I
had
not
worn
,
except
lately
those
which
I
had
taken
of
the
feet
*NL*
of
those
unfortunate
men
I
found
drowned
in
the
wreck
,
yet
not
so
good
*NL*
as
English
shoes
either
for
ease
or
service
.
I
also
found
in
the
*NL*
seaman
's
chest
about
fifty
pieces
of
eight
in
royals
,
but
no
gold
;
so
*NL*
concluded
that
what
I
took
from
the
first
belonged
to
an
officer
,
the
*NL*
latter
appearing
to
have
a
much
inferior
person
for
its
owner
.
However
,
*NL*
as
despicable
as
the
money
seemed
,
I
likewise
lugged
it
to
my
cave
,
*NL*
laying
it
up
securely
,
as
I
did
the
rest
of
my
cargo
;
and
after
I
had
*NL*
done
all
this
,
I
returned
back
to
my
boat
,
rowing
and
paddling
her
along
*NL*
till
I
came
to
my
old
harbour
,
where
I
carefully
laid
her
up
,
and
so
*NL*
made
the
best
of
my
way
to
my
castle
.
When
I
arrived
there
,
every
thing
*NL*
seemed
safe
and
quiet
:
so
that
now
my
only
business
was
to
repose
myself
*NL*
after
my
wonted
manner
,
and
take
care
of
my
domestic
affairs
.
But
though
*NL*
I
might
have
lived
very
easy
,
as
wanting
nothing
absolutely
needful
,
yet
*NL*
still
I
was
more
vigilant
than
usual
upon
account
of
the
savages
,
never
*NL*
going
much
abroad
;
or
,
if
I
did
,
it
was
to
the
east
part
of
the
island
,
*NL*
where
I
was
well
assured
that
the
savages
never
came
,
and
where
I
might
*NL*
not
be
troubled
to
carry
that
heavy
load
of
weapons
for
my
defence
,
as
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
do
if
I
went
the
other
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
years
did
I
live
in
this
anxious
condition
,
in
all
which
time
,
*NL*
contrary
to
my
former
resolutions
,
my
head
was
filled
with
nothing
but
*NL*
projects
and
deligns
,
how
I
might
escape
from
this
island
;
and
so
much
*NL*
were
my
wandering
thoughts
bent
upon
a
rambling
disposition
that
had
I
*NL*
had
the
same
boat
that
I
went
from
Sallee
in
,
I
should
have
ventured
*NL*
once
more
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
raging
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
,
however
,
but
consider
myself
as
one
of
the
unhappy
persons
,
*NL*
who
make
themselves
wretched
by
there
dissatisfaction
with
the
stations
*NL*
which
God
has
placed
them
in
;
for
,
not
to
take
a
review
of
my
primitive
*NL*
condition
,
and
my
father
's
excellent
advice
,
the
going
contrary
to
which
*NL*
was
,
as
I
may
say
,
my
original
sin
,
the
following
mistakes
of
the
same
*NL*
nature
certainly
had
been
the
means
of
my
present
unhappy
station
.
What
*NL*
business
had
I
to
leave
a
settled
fortune
,
and
well
stocked
plantation
,
*NL*
improving
and
increasing
,
where
,
by
this
time
,
I
might
have
been
worth
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
moidores
,
to
turn
supercargo
to
Guinea
,
to
fetch
*NL*
Negroes
,
when
time
and
patience
would
so
much
enlarge
my
stock
at
home
,
*NL*
as
to
be
able
to
employ
those
whose
more
immediate
business
it
was
to
*NL*
fetch
them
home
even
to
my
door
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
this
is
commonly
the
fate
of
young
heads
,
so
a
serious
reflection
*NL*
upon
the
folly
of
it
ordinarily
attends
the
exercise
of
future
years
,
*NL*
when
the
dear
bought
experience
of
time
teaches
us
repentance
.
Thus
was
*NL*
it
with
me
;
but
not
withstanding
the
thoughts
of
my
deliverance
ran
so
*NL*
strongly
in
my
mind
,
that
is
seemed
to
check
all
the
dictates
of
reason
*NL*
and
philosophy
.
And
now
to
usher
in
my
kind
reader
with
greater
pleasure
*NL*
to
the
remaining
part
of
my
relation
,
I
flatter
myself
it
will
not
be
*NL*
taken
amiss
,
to
give
him
an
account
of
my
first
conceptions
of
the
*NL*
manner
of
escaping
,
and
upon
what
foundation
I
laid
my
foolish
schemes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
retired
to
my
castle
,
after
my
late
voyage
to
the
ship
,
my
*NL*
frigate
laid
up
and
secured
,
as
usual
,
and
my
condition
the
same
as
*NL*
before
,
except
being
richer
,
though
I
had
as
little
occasion
for
riches
*NL*
as
the
Indians
of
Peru
had
for
gold
,
before
the
cruel
Spaniards
came
*NL*
among
them
:
One
night
in
March
,
being
the
rainy
season
in
the
four
and
*NL*
twentieth
year
of
my
solitude
,
I
lay
down
to
sleep
,
very
well
in
health
,
*NL*
without
distemper
pain
,
or
uncommon
uneasiness
,
either
of
body
or
mind
;
*NL*
yet
notwithstanding
,
I
could
not
compose
myself
to
sleep
all
the
night
*NL*
long
.
All
this
tedious
while
,
it
is
impossible
to
express
what
*NL*
innumerable
thoughts
came
into
my
head
.
_
I
traced
quite
over
the
whole
*NL*
history
of
my
life
in
miniature
,
from
my
utmost
remembrance
of
things
*NL*
till
I
came
to
this
island
,
and
then
proceeded
to
examine
every
action
*NL*
and
passage
that
had
occurred
since
I
had
taken
possession
of
my
*NL*
kingdom
.
_
In
my
reflections
upon
the
latter
,
I
was
_
comparing
the
happy
*NL*
posture
of
my
affairs
from
the
beginning
of
my
reign
,
to
this
life
of
*NL*
anxiety
,
fear
,
and
concern
,
since
I
had
discovered
a
print
of
a
foot
in
*NL*
the
sand
;
that
while
I
continued
without
apprehension
,
I
was
incapable
*NL*
of
feeling
the
dread
and
terror
I
now
suffered
.
_
How
thankful
rather
*NL*
ought
I
to
have
been
for
the
knowledge
of
my
danger
,
since
the
greatest
*NL*
happiness
one
can
be
possessed
of
is
to
have
sufficient
time
to
provide
*NL*
against
it
?
How
stupendous
is
the
goodness
of
Providence
,
which
sets
*NL*
such
narrow
bounds
to
the
sight
and
knowledge
of
human
nature
,
that
*NL*
while
men
walk
in
the
midst
of
so
many
dangers
they
are
kept
serene
and
*NL*
calm
,
by
having
the
events
of
things
hid
from
their
eyes
and
knowing
*NL*
nothing
of
those
many
dangers
that
surround
them
,
till
perhaps
they
are
*NL*
dissipated
and
vanish
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
more
particularly
to
considerer
of
_
the
real
danger
I
had
*NL*
for
so
many
years
escaped
;
how
I
had
walked
about
in
the
greatest
*NL*
security
and
tranquility
,
at
a
time
,
perhaps
,
when
even
nothing
but
the
*NL*
brow
of
a
hill
,
a
great
tree
,
or
the
common
approach
of
night
,
had
*NL*
interposed
between
me
and
the
destructive
hands
of
the
cannibals
,
who
*NL*
would
devour
me
with
as
good
an
appetite
,
as
I
would
a
pigeon
or
*NL*
curlew
;
_
surely
all
this
,
I
say
,
could
not
but
make
me
sincerely
*NL*
thankful
to
my
great
Preserver
,
whose
singular
protection
I
acknowledge
*NL*
with
the
greatest
humility
,
and
without
which
I
must
inevitably
have
*NL*
fallen
into
the
cruel
hands
of
those
devourers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
discussed
my
thoughts
in
the
clearest
manner
,
according
to
*NL*
my
weak
understanding
,
I
next
proceeded
to
consider
_
the
wretched
nature
*NL*
of
those
destroying
savages
,
by
seeming
,
though
with
great
reverence
,
_
*NL*
to
enquire
_
why
God
should
give
up
any
of
his
creatures
to
such
*NL*
inhumanity
,
even
to
brutality
itself
,
to
devour
its
own
kind
?
_
but
as
*NL*
this
was
rather
matter
of
obstruse
speculation
,
and
as
my
miserable
*NL*
situation
made
me
think
this
of
mine
the
most
uncomfortable
situation
in
*NL*
the
world
,
I
then
began
rather
to
inquire
_
what
part
of
the
world
these
*NL*
wretches
lived
in
;
how
far
off
the
coast
was
from
whence
they
came
;
why
*NL*
they
ventured
over
so
far
from
home
;
what
kind
of
boats
conveyed
them
*NL*
hither
;
and
why
I
could
not
order
myself
and
my
business
so
,
that
I
*NL*
might
be
able
to
attack
their
country
,
as
they
were
to
come
to
*NL*
my
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
_
thought
I
,
_
how
shall
I
manage
myself
when
I
come
thither
?
*NL*
what
will
become
of
me
if
I
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
savages
?
or
how
*NL*
shall
I
escape
from
them
if
they
make
an
attempt
upon
me
?
and
supposing
*NL*
I
should
not
fall
into
their
power
,
what
shall
I
do
for
provisions
,
or
*NL*
which
way
shall
I
bend
my
course
?
_
These
counter
thoughts
threw
me
into
*NL*
the
greatest
horror
and
confusion
imaginable
;
but
then
I
still
looked
*NL*
upon
my
present
condition
to
be
the
most
miserable
that
possibly
could
*NL*
be
,
and
that
nothing
could
be
worse
,
except
death
_
For
_
-LRB-
thought
I
-RRB-
*NL*
_
could
I
but
attain
the
shore
of
the
main
,
I
might
perhaps
meet
with
*NL*
some
reliefs
,
or
coast
it
along
,
as
I
did
with
my
boy
Xury
,
on
the
*NL*
African
shore
,
till
I
came
to
some
inhabited
country
,
where
I
might
meet
*NL*
with
some
relief
,
or
fall
in
with
some
Christian
ship
that
might
take
me
*NL*
in
;
and
if
I
failed
,
why
then
I
could
but
meet
with
death
,
which
would
*NL*
put
an
end
to
all
my
miseries
.
_
These
thoughts
,
I
must
confess
,
were
the
*NL*
fruit
of
a
distempered
mind
and
impatient
temper
made
desperate
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
by
long
continuance
of
the
troubles
and
disappointments
I
had
met
*NL*
with
in
the
wreck
;
where
I
hoped
to
have
found
some
living
person
to
*NL*
speak
to
,
by
whom
I
might
have
known
in
what
place
I
was
,
and
of
the
*NL*
probable
means
of
my
deliverance
.
Thus
,
while
my
thoughts
were
agitated
,
*NL*
my
resignation
to
the
will
of
heaven
was
entirely
suspended
;
to
that
I
*NL*
had
no
power
to
fix
my
mind
to
any
thing
,
but
to
the
project
of
a
voyage
*NL*
to
the
main
land
.
And
indeed
so
much
was
I
inflamed
upon
this
account
,
*NL*
that
it
set
my
blood
into
a
ferment
,
and
my
pulse
beat
high
,
as
though
I
*NL*
had
been
in
a
fever
;
till
nature
being
,
as
it
were
,
fatigued
and
*NL*
exhausted
with
the
thoughts
of
it
,
made
me
submit
myself
to
a
*NL*
silent
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
a
situation
,
it
is
very
strange
,
that
I
did
not
dream
of
what
I
*NL*
was
so
intent
upon
;
but
,
instead
of
it
,
my
mind
roved
on
a
quite
*NL*
different
thing
,
altogether
foreign
.
I
dreamed
,
that
as
I
was
issuing
*NL*
from
my
castle
one
morning
,
as
customary
,
when
I
perceived
upon
the
*NL*
shore
two
canoes
,
and
eleven
savages
coming
to
land
,
who
had
brought
*NL*
with
them
another
Indian
,
whom
they
designed
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
,
in
*NL*
order
to
devour
;
but
just
as
they
were
going
to
give
the
fatal
blow
,
*NL*
methought
the
poor
designed
victim
jumped
away
,
and
ran
directly
into
my
*NL*
little
thick
grove
before
my
fortification
,
to
abscond
from
his
enemies
,
*NL*
when
perceiving
that
the
others
did
not
follow
him
that
way
,
I
appeared
*NL*
to
him
;
that
he
humbly
kneeled
down
before
me
,
seeming
to
pray
for
my
*NL*
assistance
;
upon
which
I
showed
him
my
ladder
,
made
him
ascend
,
carried
*NL*
him
to
my
cave
,
and
he
became
my
servant
;
and
when
I
had
gotten
this
*NL*
man
,
I
said
to
myself
,
_
now
surely
I
may
have
some
hopes
to
attain
the
*NL*
main
land
;
for
this
fellow
will
serve
me
as
a
pilot
,
tell
me
what
to
do
,
*NL*
and
where
I
must
go
for
provisions
,
what
places
to
shun
,
what
to
venture
*NL*
to
,
and
what
to
escape
.
_
But
when
I
awaked
,
and
found
all
these
*NL*
inexpressible
impressions
of
joy
entirely
vanished
,
I
fell
into
the
*NL*
greatest
dejection
of
spirit
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
this
dream
brought
me
to
reflect
,
that
one
sure
way
of
escaping
was
*NL*
to
get
a
savage
;
that
after
I
had
ventured
my
life
to
deliver
him
from
*NL*
the
bloody
jaws
of
his
devourers
,
the
natural
sense
he
might
have
of
*NL*
such
a
preservation
,
might
inspire
him
with
a
lasting
gratitude
and
most
*NL*
sincere
affection
.
But
then
this
objection
reasonably
interposed
:
_
how
*NL*
can
I
effect
this
,
_
thought
I
,
_
without
I
attack
a
whole
company
of
*NL*
them
,
and
kill
them
all
?
why
should
I
proceed
on
such
a
desperate
*NL*
attempt
,
which
my
scruples
before
had
suggested
to
be
unlawful
?
_
and
*NL*
indeed
my
heart
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
so
much
blood
,
though
it
*NL*
were
a
means
to
procure
my
deliverance
.
'T
is
true
,
I
might
reasonably
*NL*
enough
suppose
these
men
to
be
real
enemies
to
my
life
,
men
who
would
*NL*
devour
me
,
was
it
in
their
power
,
so
that
it
was
self
preservation
in
*NL*
the
highest
degree
to
free
myself
,
by
attacking
them
in
my
own
defence
,
*NL*
as
lawfully
as
if
they
were
actually
assaulting
me
:
though
all
these
*NL*
things
,
I
say
,
seemed
to
me
to
be
of
the
greatest
weight
,
yet
,
as
I
just
*NL*
said
before
,
the
dreadful
thoughts
of
shedding
human
blood
,
struck
such
*NL*
a
terror
to
my
soul
,
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
could
reconcile
*NL*
myself
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
far
will
the
ardency
of
desire
prompt
us
on
?
For
notwithstanding
*NL*
the
many
disputes
and
perplexities
I
had
with
myself
,
I
at
length
*NL*
resolved
,
right
or
wrong
,
to
get
one
of
these
savages
into
my
hands
,
*NL*
cost
what
it
would
,
or
even
though
I
should
lose
my
life
in
the
attempt
.
*NL*
Inspired
with
this
firm
resolution
,
I
set
all
my
wits
at
work
,
to
find
*NL*
out
what
methods
I
should
take
to
answer
my
design
:
this
,
indeed
,
was
so
*NL*
difficult
a
task
,
that
I
could
not
pitch
upon
any
probable
means
to
*NL*
execute
it
:
I
,
therefore
,
resolved
continually
to
be
in
a
vigilant
*NL*
posture
,
to
perceive
when
the
savages
came
on
shore
and
to
leave
the
*NL*
rest
to
the
event
,
let
the
opportunities
offer
as
they
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
my
fixed
resolutions
;
and
accordingly
I
set
myself
upon
the
*NL*
scout
,
as
often
as
I
could
,
till
such
time
as
I
was
heartily
tired
of
*NL*
it
.
I
waited
for
above
a
year
and
a
half
,
the
greatest
part
of
which
I
*NL*
went
out
to
the
west
,
and
south-west
corner
of
the
island
,
almost
every
*NL*
day
,
to
look
for
canoes
,
but
none
appeared
.
This
was
a
very
great
*NL*
discouragement
;
yet
,
though
I
was
very
much
concerned
,
the
edge
of
my
*NL*
design
was
as
keen
as
ever
,
and
the
longer
it
seemed
to
be
delayed
,
the
*NL*
more
eager
was
I
for
it
:
in
a
word
,
I
never
before
was
so
careful
to
*NL*
shun
the
loathing
sight
of
these
savages
,
as
I
was
now
eager
to
be
with
*NL*
them
;
and
I
thought
myself
sufficiently
able
to
manage
one
,
two
,
or
*NL*
three
savages
if
I
had
them
,
so
as
to
make
them
my
entire
slaves
,
to
do
*NL*
whatsoever
I
should
direct
them
,
and
prevent
their
being
able
at
any
*NL*
time
to
do
me
any
mischief
.
Many
times
did
I
used
to
please
myself
with
*NL*
these
thoughts
,
with
long
and
ardent
expectations
;
but
nothing
*NL*
presenting
,
all
my
deep
projected
schemes
and
numerous
fancies
vanished
*NL*
away
,
as
though
,
while
I
retained
such
thoughts
,
the
decrees
of
*NL*
Providence
was
such
,
that
no
savages
were
to
come
near
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
year
and
a
half
after
,
when
I
was
seriously
musing
of
sundry
*NL*
other
ways
how
I
should
attain
my
end
,
one
morning
early
I
was
very
much
*NL*
surprised
by
seeing
no
less
than
five
canoes
all
on
shore
together
,
on
*NL*
my
side
the
island
,
and
the
savages
that
belonged
to
them
all
landed
,
*NL*
and
out
of
my
sight
.
Such
a
number
of
them
disconcerted
all
my
measures
;
*NL*
for
,
seeing
so
many
boats
,
each
of
which
would
contain
six
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
more
,
I
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
,
or
how
to
order
my
*NL*
measures
,
to
attack
twenty
or
thirty
men
single-handed
;
upon
which
,
much
*NL*
dispirited
and
perplexed
,
I
lay
still
in
my
castle
;
which
,
however
,
I
*NL*
put
in
a
proper
posture
for
an
attack
:
and
,
having
formerly
provided
all
*NL*
that
was
necessary
,
was
soon
ready
to
enter
upon
an
engagement
,
should
*NL*
they
attempt
.
Having
waited
for
some
time
,
my
impatient
temper
would
let
*NL*
me
bear
it
no
longer
;
I
set
my
guns
at
the
foot
of
my
ladder
,
and
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
ascended
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
at
two
stages
,
standing
,
*NL*
however
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
my
head
did
not
appear
above
the
hill
,
*NL*
so
that
they
could
easily
perceive
me
;
and
here
,
by
the
assistance
of
my
*NL*
perspective
glass
,
I
observed
no
less
than
thirty
in
number
around
a
*NL*
fire
,
feasting
upon
what
meat
they
had
dressed
:
how
they
cooked
it
,
or
*NL*
what
it
was
,
I
could
not
then
perfectly
tell
;
but
they
were
all
dancing
*NL*
and
capering
about
the
flames
,
using
many
frightful
and
*NL*
barbarous
gestures
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
,
with
a
curious
eye
,
I
was
beholding
these
wretches
,
my
*NL*
spirits
sunk
within
me
,
when
I
perceived
them
drag
two
miserable
*NL*
creatures
from
the
boats
,
to
act
afresh
the
dreadful
tragedy
,
as
I
*NL*
supposed
they
had
done
before
.
It
was
not
long
before
one
of
them
fell
*NL*
upon
the
ground
,
knocked
down
,
as
I
suppose
,
with
a
club
or
wooden
*NL*
sword
,
for
that
was
their
manner
;
while
two
or
three
others
went
*NL*
immediately
to
work
,
cutting
him
open
for
their
cookery
,
and
then
fell
*NL*
to
devour
him
as
they
had
done
the
former
,
while
the
last
unhappy
*NL*
captive
was
left
by
himself
,
till
such
time
as
they
were
ready
for
him
.
*NL*
The
poor
creature
looked
round
him
with
a
wishful
eye
,
trembling
at
the
*NL*
thoughts
of
death
;
yet
,
seeing
himself
a
little
at
liberty
,
nature
,
that
*NL*
very
moment
,
as
it
were
,
inspired
him
with
hopes
of
life
:
He
started
*NL*
away
from
them
,
and
ran
,
with
incredible
swiftness
along
the
sands
,
*NL*
directly
to
that
part
of
the
coast
where
my
ancient
and
venerable
*NL*
castle
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
well
imagine
,
I
was
dreadfully
affrighted
upon
this
occasion
,
*NL*
when
,
as
I
thought
,
they
pursued
him
in
a
whole
body
,
all
running
*NL*
towards
my
palace
.
And
now
,
indeed
,
I
expected
that
part
of
my
dream
was
*NL*
going
to
be
fulfilled
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
fly
to
my
grove
for
*NL*
protection
;
but
,
for
the
rest
of
my
dream
,
I
could
depend
nothing
on
it
;
*NL*
that
the
savages
would
pursue
him
thither
,
and
find
him
there
.
However
*NL*
my
spirits
,
beginning
to
recover
,
I
still
kept
upon
my
guard
;
and
I
now
*NL*
plainly
perceived
,
there
were
but
three
men
out
of
the
number
that
*NL*
pursued
him
.
I
was
infinitely
pleased
with
what
swiftness
the
poor
*NL*
creature
ran
from
his
pursuers
,
gaining
so
much
ground
upon
them
,
that
I
*NL*
plainly
perceived
,
could
he
thus
hold
out
for
half
an
hour
,
there
was
*NL*
not
the
least
doubt
but
he
would
save
his
life
from
the
power
of
*NL*
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
them
and
my
castle
there
was
a
creek
,
that
very
same
which
I
*NL*
sailed
into
with
all
my
effects
from
the
wreck
of
the
ship
on
the
steep
*NL*
banks
of
which
I
very
much
feared
the
poor
victim
would
be
taken
,
if
he
*NL*
could
not
swim
for
his
escape
:
but
soon
was
I
out
of
pain
for
him
,
when
*NL*
I
perceived
he
made
nothing
of
it
,
though
at
full
tide
,
but
with
an
*NL*
intrepid
courage
,
spurred
on
by
the
sense
of
danger
,
he
plunged
into
the
*NL*
flood
,
swimming
over
in
about
thirty
strokes
,
and
then
landing
,
ran
with
*NL*
the
same
incredible
strength
and
swiftness
as
before
.
When
the
three
*NL*
pursuers
came
to
the
creek
,
one
of
them
,
who
I
perceived
could
not
swim
,
*NL*
happily
for
his
part
,
returned
to
his
company
,
while
the
others
,
with
*NL*
equal
courage
,
but
much
less
swiftness
attained
the
other
side
,
as
*NL*
though
they
were
resolved
never
to
give
over
the
pursuit
.
And
now
or
or
*NL*
never
I
thought
was
the
time
for
me
to
procure
me
a
servant
,
companion
,
*NL*
or
assistant
;
and
that
I
was
decreed
by
Providence
to
be
the
instrument
*NL*
to
save
this
poor
creature
's
life
.
I
immediately
descended
my
two
*NL*
ladders
with
the
greatest
expedition
:
I
took
up
my
two
guns
,
which
,
I
*NL*
said
before
,
were
at
the
bottom
of
them
,
and
getting
up
again
with
the
*NL*
same
haste
towards
the
hill
,
I
made
nearer
the
sea
.
In
a
word
,
taking
a
*NL*
short
cut
down
the
hill
,
I
interposed
between
the
pursuers
and
pursued
,
*NL*
hallooing
aloud
to
the
latter
,
who
,
venturing
to
look
back
,
was
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
as
much
terrified
at
me
as
I
at
them
.
I
beckoned
to
him
with
my
*NL*
hand
,
to
return
back
,
in
the
mean
time
advancing
towards
the
pursuers
,
*NL*
and
rushing
on
the
foremost
,
I
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
of
my
*NL*
piece
,
and
laid
him
flat
on
the
ground
.
I
was
very
unwilling
to
fire
*NL*
lest
the
rest
should
hear
,
though
at
a
distance
,
I
question
whether
they
*NL*
could
or
no
;
and
being
out
of
sight
of
the
smoke
,
they
could
not
easily
*NL*
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
.
The
other
savage
seeing
his
fellow
fall
,
*NL*
stopped
as
if
he
had
been
amazed
;
when
advancing
towards
him
,
I
could
*NL*
perceive
him
take
his
bow
from
his
back
,
and
,
fixing
and
arrow
to
it
,
*NL*
was
preparing
to
shoot
at
me
,
and
,
without
dispute
,
might
have
lodged
*NL*
the
arrow
in
my
breast
;
but
,
in
this
absolutely
necessary
case
of
self
*NL*
preservation
,
I
immediately
fired
at
him
,
and
shot
him
dead
,
just
as
his
*NL*
hand
was
going
to
draw
the
fatal
string
.
All
this
while
,
the
savage
who
*NL*
had
fled
before
stood
still
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
his
enemies
*NL*
killed
,
as
he
thought
,
who
designed
to
take
away
his
life
;
so
affrighted
*NL*
was
he
with
the
fire
and
noise
of
my
piece
,
_
that
he
stood
as
it
were
*NL*
like
Lot
's
wife
,
fixed
and
immoveable
,
without
either
sense
or
motion
_
.
*NL*
This
obliged
me
to
halloo
to
him
again
,
making
the
plainest
signs
I
*NL*
could
to
him
to
draw
nearer
.
I
perceived
he
understood
those
tokens
by
*NL*
his
approaching
to
me
a
little
way
,
when
,
as
is
afraid
I
should
kill
him
*NL*
too
,
he
stopped
again
.
Several
times
did
he
advance
,
as
often
stop
in
*NL*
this
manner
,
till
coming
more
,
to
my
view
,
I
perceived
him
trembling
,
as
*NL*
if
he
was
to
undergo
the
same
fate
.
Upon
which
I
looked
upon
him
with
a
*NL*
smiling
countenance
,
and
still
beckoning
to
him
,
at
length
he
came
close
*NL*
to
me
and
kneeled
down
,
kissed
my
hand
,
laid
his
head
upon
it
,
and
*NL*
taking
me
by
the
foot
,
placed
it
upon
his
head
;
and
this
,
as
I
*NL*
understood
afterwards
,
was
in
token
of
swearing
to
be
my
slave
for
ever
.
*NL*
I
took
him
up
,
and
,
making
much
of
him
,
encouraged
him
in
the
best
*NL*
manner
I
could
.
But
my
work
was
not
yet
finished
;
for
I
perceived
the
*NL*
savage
whom
I
knocked
down
,
was
not
killed
,
but
stunned
with
the
blow
,
*NL*
and
began
to
come
to
himself
,
Upon
which
I
pointed
to
my
new
servant
,
*NL*
and
shewed
him
that
his
enemy
was
not
yet
expired
,
he
spoke
some
words
*NL*
to
me
,
but
which
I
could
not
understand
;
yet
being
the
first
sound
of
a
*NL*
man
's
voice
I
had
heard
for
above
twenty-five
years
,
they
were
very
*NL*
pleasing
to
me
.
But
there
was
no
time
for
reflection
now
,
the
wounded
*NL*
savage
recovering
himself
so
far
as
to
sit
upon
the
ground
,
which
made
*NL*
my
poor
prisoner
as
much
afraid
as
before
;
to
put
him
out
of
which
fear
,
*NL*
I
presented
my
other
gun
at
the
man
,
with
an
intent
to
shoot
him
;
but
my
*NL*
savage
,
for
so
I
must
now
call
him
,
prevented
my
firing
,
by
making
a
*NL*
motion
to
me
,
to
lend
him
my
sword
,
which
hung
naked
in
my
belt
by
my
*NL*
side
.
No
sooner
did
I
grant
his
request
,
but
away
he
runs
to
his
enemy
,
*NL*
and
at
one
blow
cut
off
his
head
as
dextrously
as
the
most
accomplished
*NL*
executioner
in
Germany
could
have
done
;
for
,
it
seems
,
these
creatures
*NL*
make
use
of
wooden
swords
made
of
hard
wood
which
will
bear
edge
enough
*NL*
to
cut
off
heads
and
arms
at
one
blow
.
When
this
valorous
exploit
was
*NL*
done
,
he
comes
to
me
laughing
,
as
a
token
of
triumph
,
delivered
me
my
*NL*
sword
again
,
with
abundance
of
suprising
gestures
,
laying
it
,
along
with
*NL*
the
bleeding
and
ghastly
head
of
the
Indian
,
at
my
feet
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
astonishment
that
my
new
servant
conceived
was
the
manner
*NL*
of
killing
the
savage
at
such
a
distance
,
without
a
bow
and
arrow
;
and
*NL*
such
was
his
longing
desire
to
know
it
,
that
he
first
pointed
to
the
*NL*
dead
carcase
,
and
then
made
signs
to
me
to
grant
him
leave
to
go
up
to
*NL*
him
.
Upon
which
I
bid
him
go
,
and
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
made
him
sensible
*NL*
I
granted
his
request
.
But
when
he
came
there
,
how
wonderfully
was
he
*NL*
struck
with
amazement
!
First
,
he
turned
him
on
one
side
,
then
on
*NL*
another
,
wondering
he
could
perceive
no
quantity
of
blood
,
he
bleeding
*NL*
inwardly
;
and
after
sufficiently
admiring
the
wound
the
bullet
had
made
*NL*
in
his
breast
,
he
took
up
his
bow
and
arrows
,
and
came
back
again
;
upon
*NL*
which
I
turned
to
go
away
,
making
signs
to
him
to
follow
,
left
the
rest
*NL*
missing
their
companions
,
might
come
in
pursuit
of
them
,
and
this
I
*NL*
found
he
understood
very
well
,
by
his
making
me
understand
that
his
*NL*
design
was
to
bury
them
,
that
they
might
not
be
seen
if
it
happened
;
and
*NL*
which
by
signs
again
I
made
him
sensible
I
very
much
approved
of
.
*NL*
Immediately
he
fell
to
work
,
and
never
was
a
grave-digger
more
dextrous
*NL*
in
the
world
than
he
was
;
for
in
an
instant
,
as
I
might
say
,
he
scraped
*NL*
a
large
hole
in
the
sand
with
his
hands
,
sufficient
to
bury
the
first
*NL*
in
;
there
he
dragged
him
;
and
without
any
ceremony
he
covered
him
over
;
*NL*
in
like
manner
he
saved
the
other
;
so
that
I
am
sure
no
undertaker
could
*NL*
be
more
expert
in
his
business
,
for
all
this
was
done
in
less
than
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
.
I
then
called
him
away
,
and
instead
of
carrying
him
*NL*
directly
to
my
castle
at
first
,
I
conveyed
him
to
my
cave
on
the
farther
*NL*
part
of
the
island
;
and
so
my
dream
was
now
fulfilled
in
that
*NL*
particular
,
that
my
grove
should
prove
an
asylum
or
sanctuary
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weary
and
faint
,
hungry
and
thirsty
,
undoubtedly
must
this
poor
creature
*NL*
be
,
supported
chiefly
by
the
vivacity
of
spirit
,
and
,
uncommon
*NL*
transports
of
joy
that
his
deliverance
occasioned
.
Here
I
gave
him
bread
*NL*
and
a
bunch
of
raisins
to
eat
,
and
water
to
drink
,
on
which
he
fed
very
*NL*
cheerfully
,
to
his
exceeding
refreshment
.
I
then
made
him
a
convenient
*NL*
bed
with
a
parcel
of
rice
straw
,
and
a
blanket
upon
it
,
-LRB-
a
bed
which
I
*NL*
used
myself
sometimes
-RRB-
and
then
pointing
to
it
,
made
signs
for
him
to
*NL*
lie
down
to
sleep
,
upon
which
the
poor
creature
went
to
take
a
*NL*
welcome
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
he
was
a
very
comely
,
handsome
,
young
fellow
,
extremely
well
*NL*
made
,
with
straight
long
limbs
,
not
two
large
,
but
tall
and
well
shaped
,
*NL*
and
,
as
near
as
I
could
reckon
,
about
twenty-six
years
of
age
.
His
*NL*
countenance
had
nothing
in
it
fierce
or
surly
,
but
rather
a
sort
of
*NL*
majesty
in
his
face
;
and
yet
,
especially
when
he
smiled
,
he
had
all
the
*NL*
sweetness
and
softness
of
an
European
.
His
hair
was
not
curled
like
*NL*
wool
,
as
many
of
the
blacks
are
,
but
long
and
black
,
with
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
,
yet
careless
tresses
spreading
over
his
shoulders
.
He
had
a
*NL*
very
high
and
large
forehead
,
with
a
great
vivacity
and
sparkling
*NL*
sharpness
in
his
eyes
.
His
skin
was
not
so
tawney
,
as
the
Virginians
,
*NL*
Brazilians
,
or
other
Americans
;
but
rather
of
a
bright
dun
,
olive
*NL*
colour
,
that
had
something
agreeable
in
it
,
though
not
very
easy
to
give
*NL*
a
description
of
.
His
face
was
round
and
plump
,
with
a
small
nose
,
very
*NL*
different
from
the
flatness
of
the
negroes
,
a
pretty
small
mouth
,
thin
*NL*
lips
,
fine
teeth
,
very
well
set
,
and
white
as
the
driven
snow
.
In
a
*NL*
word
,
such
handsome
features
,
and
exact
symmetry
in
every
part
,
made
me
*NL*
consider
that
I
had
saved
the
life
of
an
Indian
prince
,
no
less
graceful
*NL*
and
accomplished
than
the
great
_
Oroonoko
_
whose
memorable
behavior
and
*NL*
unhappy
contingencies
of
life
have
charmed
the
world
,
both
to
admiration
*NL*
of
his
person
,
and
compassion
to
his
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
let
him
be
either
prince
or
peasant
,
all
my
happiness
centered
in
*NL*
this
,
that
I
had
now
got
a
good
servant
or
companion
,
to
whom
,
as
he
*NL*
deserved
,
I
was
resolved
to
prove
a
kind
master
and
a
lasting
friend
.
He
*NL*
had
not
,
I
think
,
slept
above
an
hour
when
he
awakened
again
,
and
while
*NL*
I
was
milking
my
goats
hard
by
,
out
he
runs
from
the
cave
towards
me
in
*NL*
my
inclosure
,
and
laying
himself
down
on
the
ground
,
in
the
lowest
*NL*
prostration
,
made
all
the
antic
gestures
imaginable
,
to
express
his
*NL*
thankfulness
to
me
for
being
his
deliverer
.
I
confess
though
the
manner
*NL*
of
his
behaviour
seemed
to
be
ludicrous
enough
to
occasion
,
laughter
,
*NL*
yet
I
was
very
much
moved
at
his
affection
,
so
that
my
heart
melted
*NL*
within
me
,
fearing
he
might
die
away
in
excess
of
joy
,
like
reprieved
*NL*
malefactors
,
especially
as
I
was
incapable
either
to
let
him
blood
,
or
*NL*
administer
physic
.
It
were
to
be
wished
,
that
Christians
would
take
*NL*
example
by
this
Heathen
,
to
have
received
by
the
kind
mediation
and
*NL*
powerful
interposition
of
their
benefactors
and
deliverers
;
and
it
would
*NL*
be
likewise
happy
for
mankind
,
were
there
no
occasion
to
blame
many
,
*NL*
who
,
instead
of
thankfully
acknowledging
favours
and
benefits
,
rather
*NL*
abuse
and
condemn
those
who
have
been
the
instruments
to
save
them
from
*NL*
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
leaving
these
just
reflections
,
I
return
to
the
object
that
*NL*
occasioned
them
;
for
my
man
,
to
conclude
the
last
ceremony
of
obedience
,
*NL*
laid
down
his
head
again
on
the
ground
,
close
to
my
foot
,
and
set
my
*NL*
other
foot
upon
is
head
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
making
all
the
signs
of
*NL*
subjection
,
servitude
,
and
submission
imaginable
,
and
let
me
understand
*NL*
he
would
serve
me
as
long
as
his
life
endured
.
As
I
understood
him
in
*NL*
many
things
,
I
made
him
sensible
I
was
very
well
pleased
with
him
;
and
,
*NL*
in
a
little
time
,
I
began
to
speak
to
him
,
and
learn
him
to
talk
to
me
*NL*
again
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
made
him
understand
his
name
was
to
be
*NL*
_
Friday
_
,
because
it
was
upon
that
day
I
saved
his
life
;
then
I
taught
*NL*
him
to
say
_
Master
_
,
which
I
made
him
sensible
was
to
be
my
name
.
I
*NL*
likewise
taught
him
to
say
_
Yes
_
and
_
No
_
,
and
to
know
what
they
meant
.
*NL*
I
gave
him
some
milk
in
an
earthen
pot
,
making
him
view
me
while
I
drank
*NL*
it
before
him
,
and
soaked
my
bread
in
it
;
I
gave
him
a
cake
of
bread
,
*NL*
and
caused
him
to
soak
it
likewise
,
to
which
he
readily
consented
,
*NL*
making
signs
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
night
did
I
keep
him
there
;
but
no
sooner
did
the
morning
light
*NL*
appear
,
when
I
ordered
him
to
arise
,
and
come
along
with
me
,
with
*NL*
certain
tokens
that
I
would
give
him
some
clothes
like
mine
,
at
which
he
*NL*
seemed
very
glad
,
being
stark
naked
,
without
the
least
covering
*NL*
whatever
.
As
we
passed
by
the
place
where
the
two
men
had
been
interred
,
*NL*
my
man
pointed
directly
to
their
graves
,
showing
me
the
marks
that
he
*NL*
had
made
to
find
them
again
,
giving
me
to
understand
,
by
signs
,
that
we
*NL*
should
dig
them
up
,
and
devour
them
.
At
this
I
appeared
extremely
*NL*
displeased
,
expressed
my
utmost
abhorrence
,
as
if
I
would
vomit
at
the
*NL*
apprehensions
of
it
,
beckoning
with
my
hand
to
come
away
,
which
he
did
*NL*
with
the
greatest
reverence
and
submission
.
After
this
I
conducted
him
*NL*
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
to
view
if
the
rest
of
the
savages
were
yet
*NL*
remaining
there
;
but
when
I
looked
through
my
perspective
glass
,
I
could
*NL*
see
no
appearance
of
them
,
nor
of
their
canoes
;
so
that
it
was
evident
*NL*
they
never
minded
their
deceased
companions
whom
we
had
slain
:
which
if
*NL*
they
had
,
they
would
surely
have
searched
for
,
or
left
one
boat
behind
*NL*
for
them
to
follow
,
after
they
returned
from
their
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curiosity
,
and
a
desire
of
satisfaction
,
animating
me
with
courage
to
*NL*
see
this
scene
of
barbarity
,
I
took
my
man
Friday
with
me
,
putting
a
*NL*
sword
into
his
hand
,
with
the
bow
and
arrows
at
his
back
,
which
I
*NL*
perceived
he
could
use
very
dexterously
,
causing
him
to
carry
one
gun
*NL*
for
me
,
and
I
two
for
myself
;
and
thus
equipped
against
all
attacks
,
*NL*
away
we
marched
directly
to
the
place
of
their
bloody
entertainment
.
But
*NL*
when
I
came
there
,
I
was
struck
with
the
utmost
horror
at
so
dreadful
a
*NL*
spectacle
,
whilst
Friday
was
no
way
concerned
about
it
,
being
no
doubt
*NL*
in
his
turn
one
of
these
devourers
.
Here
lay
several
human
bones
,
there
*NL*
several
pieces
of
mangled
flesh
,
half
eaten
,
mangled
,
and
scorched
,
*NL*
whilst
streams
of
blood
ran
promiscuously
as
waters
from
a
fountain
.
As
*NL*
I
was
musing
on
this
dreadful
sight
,
Friday
took
all
the
pains
he
could
,
*NL*
by
particular
signs
,
to
make
me
understand
,
that
they
had
brought
over
*NL*
four
prisoners
to
feast
upon
,
three
of
whom
they
had
eaten
up
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
the
fourth
,
pointing
to
himself
;
that
there
having
been
a
bloody
*NL*
battle
between
them
and
his
great
king
,
in
the
just
defence
of
whom
he
*NL*
was
taken
prisoner
,
with
many
others
;
all
of
these
were
carried
off
to
*NL*
different
places
to
be
devoured
by
their
conquerors
;
and
that
it
was
his
*NL*
misfortune
to
be
brought
hither
by
these
wretches
for
the
same
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
was
made
sensible
of
these
things
,
I
caused
Friday
to
gather
*NL*
those
horrid
remains
,
and
lay
them
together
upon
a
heap
,
which
I
ordered
*NL*
to
be
set
on
fire
,
and
burnt
them
to
ashes
:
My
man
,
however
,
still
*NL*
retained
the
nature
of
a
cannibal
,
having
a
hankering
stomach
after
some
*NL*
of
the
flesh
;
but
such
an
extreme
abhorrence
did
I
express
at
the
least
*NL*
appearance
of
it
,
that
he
durst
not
but
conceal
it
;
for
I
made
him
very
*NL*
sensible
,
that
if
he
offered
any
such
thing
,
I
would
certainly
*NL*
shoot
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
done
,
I
carried
my
man
with
me
to
my
castle
,
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
pair
of
linen
drawers
,
which
I
had
taken
out
of
the
poor
gunner
's
chest
*NL*
before
mentioned
;
and
which
,
with
a
little
alteration
,
fitted
him
very
*NL*
well
;
in
the
next
place
I
made
him
a
jerkin
of
goat
's
skin
,
such
as
my
*NL*
skill
was
able
to
manage
,
and
indeed
I
thought
myself
then
a
tolerable
*NL*
good
tailor
.
I
gave
him
also
a
cap
which
I
made
of
a
hare
's
skin
,
very
*NL*
convenient
and
fashionable
.
Thus
being
clothed
tolerably
well
,
my
man
*NL*
was
no
less
proud
of
his
habit
,
than
I
was
at
seeing
him
in
it
.
Indeed
*NL*
he
went
very
aukwardly
at
first
,
the
drawers
being
too
heavy
on
his
*NL*
thighs
not
used
to
bear
any
weight
,
and
the
sleeves
of
the
waistcoat
*NL*
galled
his
shoulders
and
the
inside
of
his
arms
;
but
by
a
little
easing
*NL*
where
he
complained
they
hurt
him
,
and
by
using
himself
to
them
,
at
*NL*
length
he
took
to
them
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
concern
was
,
where
I
should
lodge
him
;
and
that
I
might
do
well
*NL*
by
him
,
and
yet
be
perfectly
easy
myself
,
I
erected
a
tent
for
him
in
*NL*
the
vacant
place
between
my
two
fortifications
,
in
the
inside
of
the
*NL*
last
,
and
the
outside
of
the
first
;
and
,
as
there
was
an
entrance
or
*NL*
door
into
my
cave
,
I
made
a
formal
framed
door-case
,
and
a
door
to
open
*NL*
on
the
inside
;
I
barred
it
up
in
the
night
time
,
taking
in
my
ladders
*NL*
too
,
so
that
,
was
my
man
to
prove
treacherous
,
there
could
be
no
way
to
*NL*
come
at
me
in
the
inside
of
my
innermost
wall
,
without
making
so
much
*NL*
noise
in
getting
over
,
that
it
must
needs
waken
me
;
for
my
first
wall
*NL*
had
now
a
complete
roof
over
it
of
long
poles
,
spreading
over
my
tent
,
*NL*
and
leaning
up
to
the
side
of
the
mountain
,
which
was
again
laid
cross
*NL*
with
smaller
sticks
instead
of
laths
,
and
thatched
over
a
great
*NL*
thickness
with
the
rice
straw
,
which
was
as
strong
as
reeds
;
and
at
the
*NL*
hole
of
the
place
,
left
on
purpose
to
go
in
or
out
by
the
ladder
,
had
*NL*
placed
a
kind
of
trap-door
,
which
,
if
it
had
been
attempted
on
the
*NL*
outside
,
would
not
have
opened
at
all
,
but
have
fallen
down
,
and
made
a
*NL*
great
noise
;
and
as
to
my
weapons
,
every
night
I
took
them
all
to
my
*NL*
bed
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
occasion
for
this
precaution
;
for
surely
never
master
*NL*
had
a
more
sincere
,
faithful
,
and
loving
servant
,
than
Friday
proved
to
*NL*
me
.
Without
passion
,
sullenness
,
or
design
,
perfectly
obliging
and
*NL*
engaging
,
his
affections
were
as
much
tied
to
me
,
as
those
of
a
child
to
*NL*
its
parents
;
&
I
might
venture
to
say
,
he
would
have
sacrificed
his
life
*NL*
for
the
saving
mine
,
upon
any
occasion
whatsoever
.
And
indeed
the
many
*NL*
testimonies
he
gave
me
of
this
,
sufficiently
convinced
me
that
I
had
no
*NL*
occasion
to
use
these
precautions
.
And
here
I
could
not
but
reflect
with
*NL*
great
wonder
,
that
however
it
hath
pleased
the
Almighty
in
his
*NL*
providence
,
and
in
the
government
of
the
creation
,
to
take
from
so
great
*NL*
a
part
of
the
world
of
his
creatures
,
the
noblest
uses
to
which
their
*NL*
faculties
,
and
the
powers
of
their
souls
are
adapted
;
yet
that
he
has
*NL*
bestowed
upon
them
the
same
reason
,
affections
,
sentiments
of
kindness
*NL*
and
obligation
,
passions
of
resentment
,
sincerity
,
fidelity
,
and
all
the
*NL*
capacities
of
doing
and
receiving
good
that
he
has
given
us
;
and
that
*NL*
when
he
is
graciously
pleased
to
offer
them
occasions
of
exerting
these
,
*NL*
they
are
as
ready
,
nay
,
more
ready
,
to
apply
them
to
the
proper
uses
for
*NL*
which
they
were
bestowed
,
than
we
often
are
.
These
thoughts
would
make
*NL*
me
melancholy
,
especially
when
I
considered
how
mean
a
use
we
make
of
*NL*
all
these
,
even
though
we
have
these
powers
enlightened
by
the
Holy
*NL*
Spirit
of
God
,
and
by
the
knowledge
of
this
world
,
as
an
addition
to
our
*NL*
understanding
;
and
why
it
has
pleased
the
heavenly
Wisdom
to
conceal
the
*NL*
life
saving
knowledge
from
so
many
millions
of
souls
who
would
certainly
*NL*
make
a
much
better
use
of
it
than
generally
mankind
do
at
this
time
.
*NL*
These
reflections
would
sometimes
lead
me
so
far
,
as
to
invade
the
*NL*
sovereignty
of
Providence
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
arraign
the
justice
of
such
*NL*
an
arbitrary
disposition
of
things
,
that
should
obscure
that
light
from
*NL*
some
,
and
reveal
it
to
others
,
and
yet
expect
a
like
duty
from
all
.
But
*NL*
I
closed
it
up
,
checking
my
thoughts
with
this
conclusion
;
first
,
That
*NL*
we
were
ignorant
of
that
right
and
law
by
which
those
should
be
*NL*
condemned
;
but
as
the
Almighty
was
necessarily
,
and
by
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
essence
,
infinitely
just
and
holy
;
so
it
could
not
be
otherwise
,
but
*NL*
that
if
these
creatures
were
all
destined
to
absence
from
himself
,
it
*NL*
was
on
account
of
sinning
against
that
light
,
_
which
_
,
as
the
Scripture
*NL*
says
,
_
was
a
law
to
themselves
_
and
by
such
rules
as
their
consciences
*NL*
would
acknowledge
to
be
just
,
though
the
first
foundation
was
not
*NL*
discovered
to
us
.
And
,
secondly
,
That
still
as
we
were
the
clay
in
the
*NL*
hand
of
the
potter
,
no
vessel
could
thus
say
to
him
,
_
Why
hast
thou
*NL*
fashioned
me
after
this
manner
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
above
two
or
three
days
returned
to
my
castle
,
but
my
*NL*
chief
design
was
,
how
I
should
bring
Friday
off
from
this
horrid
way
of
*NL*
feeding
;
and
to
take
from
him
that
inhuman
relish
he
by
nature
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
,
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
let
him
taste
other
flesh
,
which
*NL*
might
the
rather
tempt
him
to
the
same
abhorrence
I
so
often
expressed
*NL*
against
their
accursed
way
of
living
.
Upon
which
,
one
morning
I
took
him
*NL*
out
with
me
,
with
an
intention
to
kill
a
kid
out
of
the
flock
,
and
bring
*NL*
it
home
and
dress
it
.
As
I
was
going
,
I
perceived
a
she-goat
lying
down
*NL*
in
the
shade
,
and
two
young
kids
sitting
by
her
.
Immediately
I
catched
*NL*
hold
of
my
man
Friday
,
and
bidding
him
stand
still
,
and
not
stir
,
I
*NL*
presented
my
piece
,
and
shot
one
of
the
kids
.
My
poor
servant
,
who
had
*NL*
at
a
distance
perceived
me
kill
his
adversary
,
and
yet
did
not
know
by
*NL*
what
means
,
or
how
it
was
done
,
stood
trembling
and
surprised
,
and
*NL*
looked
so
amazed
,
that
I
thought
he
would
have
sunk
into
the
earth
.
He
*NL*
did
not
see
the
kid
I
aimed
at
,
or
behold
I
had
killed
it
,
but
ripped
up
*NL*
his
waistcoat
to
see
if
he
was
not
wounded
,
thinking
my
resolution
was
*NL*
to
kill
him
;
for
coming
to
me
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
earnestly
*NL*
pronouncing
many
things
which
I
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
;
which
*NL*
at
length
I
perceived
was
,
that
I
would
not
take
away
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
I
was
much
concerned
to
see
him
in
that
condition
,
where
nature
*NL*
is
upon
the
severest
trial
,
when
the
immediate
hand
of
death
is
ready
to
*NL*
put
for
ever
a
period
to
this
mortal
life
;
and
indeed
so
much
compassion
*NL*
had
I
to
this
creature
,
that
it
was
with
difficulty
I
restrained
from
*NL*
tears
.
But
,
however
,
as
another
sort
of
countenance
was
necessary
,
and
*NL*
to
convince
him
that
I
would
do
no
harm
,
I
took
him
smiling
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
then
laughed
at
him
,
and
pointing
to
the
kid
which
I
had
slain
,
made
*NL*
signs
to
him
to
fetch
it
,
which
accordingly
he
did
.
No
less
curious
was
*NL*
he
in
viewing
how
the
creature
was
killed
,
than
he
had
been
before
in
*NL*
beholding
the
Indian
;
which
,
while
he
was
admiring
at
,
I
charged
my
gun
*NL*
again
,
and
presently
perceived
a
great
fowl
like
a
hawk
,
perching
upon
a
*NL*
tree
within
shot
;
and
therefore
,
to
let
Friday
understand
what
I
was
*NL*
going
to
do
,
I
called
him
to
me
again
,
pointing
at
the
fowl
,
which
I
*NL*
found
to
be
a
parrot
.
I
made
him
understand
that
I
would
shoot
and
kill
*NL*
that
bird
;
accordingly
I
fired
,
and
bade
him
look
,
when
immediately
he
*NL*
saw
the
parrot
fall
down
.
Again
he
stood
like
one
amazed
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
all
I
had
said
to
him
:
and
the
more
confounded
he
was
,
*NL*
because
he
did
not
perceive
me
put
any
thing
into
my
gun
.
Undoubtedly
a
*NL*
thing
so
utterly
strange
,
carrying
death
along
with
it
,
far
or
near
,
*NL*
either
to
man
or
beast
,
must
certainly
create
the
greatest
astonishment
*NL*
to
one
who
never
had
heard
such
a
thing
in
his
whole
life
;
and
really
*NL*
his
amazement
continued
so
long
,
that
had
I
allowed
it
,
he
would
have
*NL*
prostrated
himself
before
me
and
my
gun
,
with
the
greatest
worship
and
*NL*
adoration
.
As
for
the
gun
in
particular
,
he
would
not
so
much
as
touch
*NL*
it
for
several
days
after
,
but
would
come
&
communicate
his
thoughts
to
*NL*
it
,
&
talk
to
it
,
as
if
the
senseless
piece
had
understood
and
answered
*NL*
him
;
all
this
I
could
perceive
him
do
,
when
he
thought
my
back
was
*NL*
turned
,
the
chief
intent
of
which
was
,
to
desire
it
not
to
kill
him
,
as
*NL*
I
afterwards
came
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
strove
to
prevent
his
admiration
,
nor
hinder
him
from
those
*NL*
comical
gestures
he
used
on
such
occasions
;
but
when
his
astonishment
*NL*
was
a
little
over
,
I
make
tokens
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
the
parrot
that
*NL*
I
had
shot
;
which
accordingly
he
did
,
staying
some
time
longer
than
*NL*
usual
,
by
reason
the
bird
not
being
quite
dead
,
had
fluttered
some
way
*NL*
further
from
the
place
where
she
fell
.
In
the
mean
time
,
as
he
was
*NL*
looking
for
her
,
I
took
the
advantage
of
charging
my
gun
again
,
that
so
*NL*
I
might
be
ready
for
any
other
mark
that
offered
;
but
nothing
more
*NL*
occurred
at
that
time
.
So
I
brought
home
the
kid
,
and
the
same
evening
*NL*
took
off
the
skin
and
divided
the
carcase
as
well
as
I
could
.
Part
of
*NL*
the
flesh
I
stewed
and
boiled
in
a
pot
I
had
for
this
purpose
.
And
then
*NL*
spreading
my
table
,
I
sat
down
,
giving
my
man
some
of
it
to
eat
,
who
was
*NL*
wonderfully
pleased
and
seemed
to
like
it
very
well
:
but
what
was
the
*NL*
most
surprising
to
him
was
to
see
me
eat
salt
with
it
:
upon
which
he
*NL*
made
me
understand
,
that
the
salt
was
very
bad
for
me
;
when
putting
a
*NL*
little
into
his
mouth
,
he
seemed
to
nauseate
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
spit
and
sputter
at
it
,
and
then
washed
his
mouth
with
fresh
water
:
but
*NL*
to
shew
him
how
contrary
his
opinion
was
to
mine
,
I
put
some
meat
into
*NL*
my
mouth
without
salt
and
feigned
to
spit
and
sputter
as
much
for
the
*NL*
want
of
it
,
as
he
had
done
at
it
;
yet
all
this
proved
of
no
*NL*
signification
to
Friday
;
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
could
endure
*NL*
salt
in
his
meat
or
broth
,
and
even
then
but
a
small
quantity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
having
fed
him
sufficiently
with
boiled
meat
and
broth
at
that
*NL*
time
,
the
next
day
I
was
resolved
to
feast
him
with
a
roasted
piece
of
*NL*
the
kid
.
And
having
no
spit
to
fasten
it
,
nor
jack
to
turn
it
,
I
made
*NL*
use
of
that
common
artifice
which
many
of
the
common
people
of
England
*NL*
have
,
that
is
to
let
two
poles
upon
each
side
of
the
fire
,
and
one
cross
*NL*
on
top
,
hanging
the
meat
thereon
with
a
string
,
and
so
turning
round
*NL*
continually
,
roast
it
,
in
the
same
manner
as
we
read
bloody
tyrants
of
*NL*
old
cruelly
roasted
the
holy
martyrs
.
This
practice
caused
great
*NL*
admiration
in
my
man
Friday
,
being
quite
another
way
than
that
to
which
*NL*
the
savages
were
accustomed
.
But
when
he
came
to
taste
the
sweetness
and
*NL*
tenderness
of
the
flesh
,
he
expressed
his
entire
satisfaction
above
a
*NL*
thousand
different
ways
.
And
as
I
could
not
but
understand
his
meaning
,
*NL*
you
may
be
sure
I
was
as
wonderfully
pleased
,
especially
when
he
made
it
*NL*
also
very
plain
to
me
,
that
he
would
never
,
while
he
lived
eat
man
's
*NL*
flesh
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
high
time
I
should
set
my
servant
to
work
;
so
next
day
I
set
*NL*
him
to
beat
out
some
corn
,
and
sat
it
in
the
same
manner
as
I
had
done
*NL*
before
.
And
really
the
fellow
was
very
quick
and
handy
in
the
execution
*NL*
of
any
thing
I
ordered
him
to
go
about
.
I
made
him
understand
that
it
*NL*
was
to
make
bread
for
us
to
eat
,
and
afterwards
let
him
see
me
make
it
.
*NL*
In
short
,
he
did
every
thing
as
I
ordered
him
,
and
in
a
little
time
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
perform
it
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
considering
that
I
had
two
mouths
to
feed
instead
of
one
,
it
was
*NL*
necessary
that
I
must
provide
more
ground
for
my
harvest
,
and
plant
a
*NL*
larger
quantity
of
corn
than
I
commonly
used
to
do
;
upon
which
I
marked
*NL*
out
a
larger
piece
of
land
,
fencing
it
in
,
in
the
same
manner
as
I
had
*NL*
done
before
;
in
the
execution
of
which
I
must
give
Friday
this
good
*NL*
word
;
that
no
man
could
work
,
more
hardy
or
with
better
will
than
he
*NL*
did
:
and
when
I
made
him
sensible
that
it
was
for
bread
to
serve
him
as
*NL*
well
as
me
,
he
then
very
passionately
made
me
understand
that
he
thought
*NL*
I
had
much
more
labour
on
his
account
,
than
I
had
for
myself
;
and
that
*NL*
no
pains
or
diligence
should
be
wanting
in
him
,
if
I
would
but
direct
*NL*
him
in
those
works
wherein
he
might
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
certainly
own
,
that
this
was
the
most
pleasant
year
I
ever
had
on
*NL*
the
island
;
for
after
some
time
Friday
began
to
talk
pretty
well
,
and
*NL*
understood
the
names
of
those
things
which
I
was
wont
to
call
for
,
and
*NL*
the
places
where
I
used
to
send
him
.
So
that
my
long
silent
tongue
,
*NL*
which
had
been
useless
so
many
years
,
except
in
an
exclamatory
manner
,
*NL*
either
for
deliverance
or
blessings
,
now
began
to
be
occupied
in
*NL*
teaching
,
and
talking
to
my
man
Friday
for
indeed
I
had
such
a
singular
*NL*
satisfaction
in
the
fellow
himself
,
so
innocent
did
his
simple
and
*NL*
unfeigned
honesty
appear
more
and
more
to
me
every
day
,
that
I
really
*NL*
began
entirely
to
love
him
;
and
for
his
part
,
I
believe
there
was
no
*NL*
love
lost
,
and
that
his
nature
had
been
more
charmed
by
his
exceeding
*NL*
kindness
,
and
his
affections
more
placed
upon
me
,
than
any
other
object
*NL*
whatsoever
among
his
own
countrymen
.
I
once
had
a
great
mind
to
try
if
*NL*
he
had
any
hankering
inclination
to
his
own
country
again
;
and
by
this
*NL*
time
,
having
learned
the
English
so
well
;
that
he
could
give
me
*NL*
tolerable
answer
to
any
question
which
I
demanded
.
I
asked
him
whether
*NL*
that
nation
to
which
he
belonged
,
ever
conquered
in
battle
?
This
*NL*
question
made
Friday
to
smile
,
and
to
which
he
answered
,
_
Yes
,
yes
,
we
*NL*
always
fight
the
better
;
_
as
much
as
to
say
,
they
always
got
the
better
*NL*
in
fight
.
Upon
which
we
proceeded
on
the
following
discourse
:
_
You
say
_
,
*NL*
said
I
,
_
that
you
always
fight
the
better
;
why
,
then
,
Friday
,
how
came
*NL*
you
to
be
taken
prisoner
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
But
for
all
that
my
nation
beat
much
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
.
_
How
say
you
,
beat
?
if
your
nation
beat
them
,
how
came
you
to
be
*NL*
taken
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
They
more
many
mans
than
my
nation
in
the
place
where
me
was
;
*NL*
they
take
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
me
:
my
nation
much
over
beat
them
in
the
*NL*
yonder
place
where
me
no
was
,
there
my
nation
mans
beat
one
,
two
,
three
,
*NL*
great
tousand
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
.
_
Then
why
did
not
your
men
recover
you
from
the
hands
of
your
*NL*
enemies
?
_
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
They
run
one
,
two
,
or
three
,
and
me
:
they
make
all
go
in
the
*NL*
canoe
;
my
nation
have
no
canoe
that
time
_
--
*NL*
*NL*
Master
.
_
'T
is
very
well
,
Friday
;
but
what
does
your
nation
do
with
the
*NL*
prisoners
they
take
?
Do
they
carry
them
away
and
eat
them
as
these
*NL*
have
done
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
Yes
,
yes
,
my
nation
eat
mans
too
,
eat
up
all
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
.
_
To
what
place
do
they
carry
them
to
be
devoured
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
Go
to
other
nations
where
they
think
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
.
_
Do
they
bring
them
hither
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
Yes
,
come
over
hither
,
came
over
other
place
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
.
_
And
have
you
been
with
them
here
,
Friday
_
?
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
.
_
Yes
,
me
been
here
_
,
-LRB-
pointing
to
the
north-west
of
the
island
,
*NL*
being
the
side
where
they
used
to
land
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
having
gotten
what
account
I
could
from
my
man
,
I
plainly
*NL*
understood
that
he
had
been
as
bad
as
any
of
the
rest
of
the
cannibals
,
*NL*
having
been
formerly
among
the
savages
who
used
to
come
on
shore
on
the
*NL*
farthest
part
of
the
island
,
upon
the
same
bloody
occasion
as
he
was
*NL*
brought
hither
for
;
and
some
time
after
I
carried
him
to
that
place
*NL*
where
he
pointed
;
and
no
sooner
did
he
come
there
,
but
he
presently
knew
*NL*
the
ground
,
signifying
to
me
that
he
was
once
there
when
they
ate
up
*NL*
twenty
men
,
two
women
and
a
young
child
;
but
as
he
could
not
explain
the
*NL*
number
in
English
,
he
did
it
by
so
many
stones
in
a
row
,
making
a
sign
*NL*
to
me
to
count
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
passage
I
have
the
rather
mentioned
,
because
it
led
to
things
more
*NL*
important
and
useful
for
me
to
know
;
for
after
I
had
this
satisfactory
*NL*
discourse
with
him
,
my
next
question
was
,
how
far
it
was
from
the
island
*NL*
to
the
shore
,
and
whether
the
canoes
were
not
often
lost
in
the
ocean
?
*NL*
to
which
he
answered
,
_
there
was
no
danger
,
that
no
canoes
were
ever
*NL*
lost
;
but
that
after
a
little
way
out
to
the
sea
,
there
was
a
strong
*NL*
current
and
a
wind
always
one
way
in
the
afternoon
_
.
This
I
thought
at
*NL*
first
to
be
no
more
than
the
sets
of
the
tide
,
of
going
out
or
coming
*NL*
in
;
but
I
afterwards
understood
it
was
occasioned
by
the
great-draught
*NL*
and
reflux
of
the
mighty
river
Oroonoko
,
in
the
mouth
or
gulf
of
which
I
*NL*
imagined
my
kingdom
lay
:
and
that
the
land
which
I
perceived
to
the
W.
*NL*
and
N.W.
must
be
the
great
island
Trinidad
,
on
the
north
of
the
river
.
A
*NL*
thousand
questions
-LRB-
if
that
would
satisfy
me
-RRB-
did
I
ask
Friday
about
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
country
,
the
sea
,
the
coasts
,
the
inhabitants
,
and
what
*NL*
nations
were
nearest
them
:
To
which
questions
the
poor
fellow
declared
*NL*
all
he
knew
with
the
greatest
openness
&
utmost
sincerity
.
When
I
*NL*
demanded
of
him
the
particular
names
of
the
various
nations
of
his
sort
*NL*
of
people
,
he
could
only
answer
me
in
general
that
they
were
called
*NL*
_
Carrabee
_
.
Hence
it
was
I
considered
that
these
must
be
the
Carribees
,
*NL*
so
much
taken
notice
of
by
our
maps
to
be
on
that
part
of
America
,
which
*NL*
reaches
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
Oroonoko
to
Guiana
,
and
so
on
to
St.
*NL*
Martha
.
Then
Friday
proceeded
to
tell
me
,
_
that
up
a
great
way
beyond
*NL*
the
moon
_
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
beyond
the
setting
of
the
moon
,
which
must
*NL*
be
W.
from
their
country
,
_
there
dwelt
white-bearded
men
,
such
as
I
*NL*
was
_
,
pointing
to
my
whiskers
,
_
and
that
they
kill
much
mans
_
.
I
was
not
*NL*
ignorant
with
what
barbarity
the
Spaniards
treated
these
creatures
;
so
*NL*
that
I
presently
concluded
it
must
be
them
,
whose
cruelties
had
spread
*NL*
throughout
America
,
to
be
remembered
even
to
succeeding
generations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
you
may
be
sure
,
this
knowledge
,
which
the
imperfect
knowledge
of
*NL*
my
man
had
led
me
to
,
was
very
comfortable
to
me
,
and
made
me
so
curious
*NL*
as
to
ask
him
how
I
might
depart
from
this
island
,
&
get
amongst
those
*NL*
white
men
?
He
told
me
,
_
Yes
,
yes
,
I
might
go
in
two
canoes
_
.
In
two
*NL*
canoes
,
thought
I
,
what
does
my
man
mean
?
surely
he
means
one
for
*NL*
himself
,
and
another
for
me
;
and
if
not
,
how
must
two
canoes
hold
me
*NL*
without
being
joined
,
or
one
part
of
my
body
being
put
in
one
,
and
*NL*
another
in
another
?
And
indeed
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
understood
*NL*
his
meaning
;
which
was
,
that
it
must
be
a
large
boat
,
as
big
as
two
*NL*
canoes
,
able
to
bear
with
the
waves
,
and
not
so
liable
to
be
overwhelmed
*NL*
as
a
small
one
must
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
there
is
not
a
state
of
life
but
what
may
be
happy
,
if
people
*NL*
would
but
endeavour
for
their
part
to
make
it
so
.
He
is
not
the
*NL*
happiest
man
that
has
the
most
riches
;
but
he
that
is
content
with
what
*NL*
he
hath
.
Before
I
had
my
servant
,
I
thought
myself
miserable
till
I
had
*NL*
him
;
and
now
that
I
had
enjoyed
the
happy
benefits
of
him
,
I
still
*NL*
complained
,
and
begged
a
deliverance
from
a
place
of
retirement
,
ease
,
*NL*
and
plenty
,
where
Providence
had
sufficiently
blessed
me
.
In
a
word
,
*NL*
from
this
time
I
entertained
some
hopes
,
that
one
time
or
other
I
might
*NL*
find
an
opportunity
to
make
my
escape
from
this
island
,
and
that
this
*NL*
poor
savage
might
be
a
great
furtherance
thereto
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
since
my
man
became
so
intelligent
as
to
understand
and
*NL*
speak
to
me
,
I
spared
no
pain
nor
diligence
to
instruct
him
,
according
*NL*
to
my
poor
share
of
knowledge
in
the
principles
of
religion
,
and
the
*NL*
adoration
that
he
ought
to
pay
to
the
TRUE
GOD
.
One
time
,
as
I
very
well
*NL*
remember
,
I
asked
him
who
made
him
?
At
first
the
innocent
creature
did
*NL*
not
understand
what
I
meant
,
but
rather
thought
I
asked
him
who
was
his
*NL*
father
?
upon
which
I
took
another
way
to
make
him
sensible
,
by
demanding
*NL*
from
him
an
answer
to
this
question
.
``
Friday
,
''
I
said
,
``
who
is
it
that
*NL*
made
the
sea
,
this
ground
whereon
we
walk
,
and
all
the
hills
and
woods
*NL*
which
we
behold
?
''
And
here
,
indeed
,
I
did
not
miss
my
intention
;
for
he
*NL*
told
me
_
it
was
Old
Benamuckee
_
-LRB-
the
God
whom
I
supposed
these
savages
*NL*
adored
-RRB-
_
who
lived
a
great
way
beyond
all
_
.
But
as
to
his
attributes
,
*NL*
poor
Friday
was
an
utter
stranger
.
He
could
describe
nothing
of
this
*NL*
great
person
;
and
all
that
he
could
say
was
,
_
that
he
was
very
old
,
much
*NL*
older
than
the
sea
and
land
,
the
moon
,
or
the
stars
_
.
``
Friday
,
''
said
I
*NL*
again
,
``
if
this
great
and
old
person
has
made
all
things
in
the
world
,
*NL*
how
comes
it
to
pass
,
that
all
things
,
as
you
in
particular
,
do
not
*NL*
adore
and
worship
him
?
upon
this
looking
very
grave
,
with
a
perfect
*NL*
sweet
look
of
innocence
,
he
replied
:
_
Master
all
things
say
O
to
him
_
,
''
*NL*
by
which
it
may
reasonably
be
supposed
he
meant
adoration
.
``
And
where
,
''
*NL*
said
I
,
``
do
the
people
of
your
country
go
when
they
die
?
''
He
answered
*NL*
_
to
Benamuckee
_
.
``
What
,
and
those
people
that
are
eaten
up
,
do
they
go
*NL*
there
?
''
_
Benamuckee
_
,
said
he
,
_
love
'em
dearly
;
me
pray
to
Benamuckee
*NL*
in
the
canoe
,
and
Benamuckee
would
love
me
when
dey
eat
me
all
up
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
discourses
as
these
had
I
with
my
man
,
and
such
made
me
sensible
,
*NL*
that
the
true
God
is
worshipped
,
tho
'
under
imperfect
similitudes
;
and
*NL*
that
the
false
adoration
which
the
Heathens
give
to
their
imaginary
*NL*
Deity
,
is
as
great
an
argument
of
the
divine
essence
,
as
the
most
*NL*
learned
Atheists
_
-LRB-
falsely
so
called
-RRB-
_
can
bring
against
it
;
for
God
*NL*
will
be
glorified
in
his
works
,
let
their
denominations
be
what
it
will
;
*NL*
and
I
can
not
be
of
that
opinion
which
some
conceive
,
that
God
should
*NL*
decree
men
to
be
damned
for
want
of
a
right
notion
of
faith
,
in
a
place
*NL*
where
the
wisdom
of
the
Almighty
has
not
permitted
it
to
be
preached
;
*NL*
and
therefore
can
not
but
conclude
,
that
since
obedience
is
the
best
*NL*
sacrifice
,
these
poor
creatures
are
acting
by
that
light
and
knowledge
*NL*
which
they
are
possessed
of
,
may
undoubtedly
obtain
a
happy
salvation
,
*NL*
though
not
that
enjoyment
with
Christ
,
as
his
saints
,
confessors
,
and
*NL*
martyrs
must
enjoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
laying
these
determinations
aside
,
more
fit
for
divines
than
me
to
*NL*
discuss
,
I
began
to
instruct
my
servant
in
the
saving
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
true
Deity
,
in
which
the
direction
of
God
's
Holy
Spirit
assisted
me
.
I
*NL*
lifted
up
my
hands
to
Heaven
,
and
pointing
thereto
,
told
him
``
that
the
*NL*
great
Maker
of
Heaven
and
Earth
lived
there
;
that
as
his
infinite
power
*NL*
fashioned
this
world
out
of
a
confused
chaos
,
and
made
it
in
that
*NL*
beautiful
frame
which
we
behold
;
so
he
governs
and
preserves
it
by
his
*NL*
unbounded
knowledge
,
sovereign
greatness
and
peculiar
providence
;
that
*NL*
he
was
omnipotent
,
could
do
every
thing
for
us
,
give
every
thing
to
us
,
*NL*
and
take
every
thing
away
from
us
;
that
he
was
a
rewarder
and
punisher
*NL*
of
good
,
and
evil
actions
;
that
there
was
nothing
but
what
he
knew
,
no
*NL*
thoughts
so
secret
,
but
what
he
could
bring
to
light
;
''
and
thus
,
by
*NL*
degrees
,
I
opened
his
eyes
,
and
described
to
him
``
the
manner
of
the
*NL*
creation
of
the
world
,
the
situation
of
paradise
,
the
transgression
of
*NL*
our
first
parents
,
the
wickedness
of
God
's
peculiar
people
,
and
the
*NL*
universal
sins
and
abominations
of
the
whole
earth
.
''
When
these
things
*NL*
were
implanted
in
his
mind
,
I
told
him
``
that
as
God
's
justice
was
equal
*NL*
to
his
mercy
,
he
resolved
to
destroy
this
world
,
till
his
Son
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
interposed
in
our
behalf
;
and
to
procure
our
redemption
,
obtained
*NL*
leave
of
his
heavenly
Father
to
come
down
from
Heaven
into
the
world
,
*NL*
Where
he
took
human
nature
upon
him
,
instructed
us
in
our
way
to
eternal
*NL*
life
,
and
died
as
a
sacrifice
for
our
sins
;
that
he
was
now
ascended
*NL*
into
Heaven
,
mediating
for
our
pardon
,
delivering
our
petitions
,
and
*NL*
obtaining
all
those
good
benefits
which
we
ask
in
his
name
,
by
humble
*NL*
and
hearty
prayers
,
all
which
were
heard
at
the
throne
of
Heaven
.
''
As
*NL*
frequently
I
used
to
inculcate
things
into
his
mind
.
Friday
one
day
told
*NL*
me
,
_
that
if
our
great
God
could
hear
us
beyond
the
sun
,
he
must
surely
*NL*
be
a
greater
God
than
their
Benamuckee
,
who
lived
but
a
little
way
off
,
*NL*
yet
could
not
hear
them
till
they
ascended
the
great
mountains
,
where
he
*NL*
dwelt
to
speak
to
him
.
_
`
What
'
said
I
,
`
Friday
,
did
you
go
thither
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
too
?
'
He
answered
,
_
No
,
they
never
went
that
were
young
*NL*
men
,
none
but
old
men
,
called
their
Oowakakee
_
,
meaning
the
Indian
*NL*
priests
,
_
who
went
to
say
O
,
_
-LRB-
so
he
called
saying
their
prayers
-RRB-
_
and
*NL*
they
returned
back
,
and
told
them
what
Benamuckee
said
.
_
From
hence
,
I
*NL*
could
not
but
observe
how
happy
we
Christians
are
,
who
have
God
's
*NL*
immediate
revelation
for
our
certain
guide
;
and
that
our
faith
is
*NL*
neither
misled
,
nor
our
reason
imposed
upon
,
by
any
set
of
men
,
*NL*
such
as
these
Indian
impostures
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
clear
up
this
palpable
cheat
to
my
man
Friday
,
I
told
*NL*
him
,
``
that
the
pretence
of
their
ancient
men
going
up
to
*NL*
the
mountain
to
say
O
to
their
God
_
Benamuckee
_
was
an
imposture
,
*NL*
and
that
their
bringing
back
an
answer
was
all
a
sham
,
if
*NL*
not
worse
;
for
that
,
if
there
was
any
such
thing
spoken
to
them
,
*NL*
surely
it
must
proceed
from
an
infernal
spirit
.
''
And
here
I
*NL*
thought
it
necessary
to
enter
into
a
long
discourse
with
him
,
*NL*
which
I
did
after
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
must
know
,
that
before
the
world
*NL*
was
made
,
there
was
an
Almighty
power
existing
,
by
whose
*NL*
power
all
things
were
made
,
and
whose
Majesty
shall
have
no
*NL*
end
.
To
be
glorified
and
adored
by
beings
of
a
heavenly
nature
,
*NL*
he
created
angels
and
archangels
,
that
is
glorified
spirits
*NL*
resembling
himself
,
to
encompass
his
throne
,
eternally
singing
*NL*
forth
his
praise
in
the
most
heavenly
sounds
and
divine
harmony
.
*NL*
And
,
among
this
heavenly
choir
,
Lucifer
bore
a
great
sway
,
as
being
*NL*
then
one
of
the
peculiar
favourites
of
these
celestial
abodes
;
*NL*
but
he
,
contrary
to
that
duty
he
owed
his
heavenly
Sovereign
,
*NL*
with
unbounded
ingratitude
to
his
Divine
Creator
,
not
only
*NL*
envied
him
that
adoration
which
was
his
due
,
but
thought
to
*NL*
usurp
that
throne
,
which
he
had
neither
power
to
keep
,
nor
*NL*
title
to
pretend
to
.
He
raised
a
dissention
and
civil
war
in
*NL*
Heaven
,
and
had
a
number
of
angels
to
take
his
part
.
Unbounded
*NL*
folly
!
stupendous
pride
!
to
hope
for
victory
,
and
aspire
*NL*
above
his
powerful
Creator
!
The
Deity
,
not
fearful
of
such
*NL*
an
enemy
,
yet
justly
provoked
at
this
rebellion
,
commissioned
*NL*
his
archangel
Michael
to
lead
forth
the
heavenly
host
,
and
give
*NL*
him
battle
;
the
advantage
of
which
was
quickly
perceived
,
*NL*
by
Satan
's
being
overthrown
,
and
the
prince
of
the
air
,
for
so
*NL*
was
the
devil
called
,
with
all
his
fallen
angels
,
driven
headlong
*NL*
into
a
dismal
place
,
which
is
called
_
Hell
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
recital
of
this
truth
made
my
man
give
the
greatest
attention
,
*NL*
and
he
expressed
a
great
satisfaction
by
his
gestures
,
that
God
*NL*
had
sent
the
devil
into
a
deep
hole
.
And
then
I
desired
him
to
*NL*
give
great
heed
to
what
I
had
further
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sooner
,
''
proceeded
I
,
``
was
God
freed
from
,
and
the
Heaven
clear
*NL*
of
this
arch-traitor
,
but
the
Father
speaks
to
the
Son
and
Holy
*NL*
Spirit
,
who
belonged
to
his
essence
,
and
were
equal
to
him
in
power
*NL*
and
glory
,
_
Come
let
us
make

said
he
_
in
our
own
image
,
after
*NL*
our
own
likeness

,
Gen.
i.
26
.
to
have
dominion
over
the
creatures
*NL*
of
the
world
which
we
have
created
.
And
these
he
intended
should
*NL*
glorify
him
in
Heaven
,
according
to
their
obedience
in
this
state
of
*NL*
probation
on
earth
,
which
was
,
as
it
were
,
to
be
the
school
to
train
*NL*
them
up
for
these
heavenly
mansions
.
Now
,
Satan
seeing
himself
foiled
;
*NL*
yet
that
God
had
taken
the
power
from
him
as
prince
of
the
air
,
which
*NL*
power
Heaven
designed
he
should
retain
,
whereby
his
creatures
might
*NL*
be
tried
;
in
revenge
for
the
disgrace
he
had
received
,
he
tempts
*NL*
Adam
's
wife
,
Eve
,
to
taste
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
*NL*
evil
,
which
God
had
forbidden
.
He
appears
to
her
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
serpent
,
then
a
most
beautiful
creature
,
and
tells
her
that
it
was
no
*NL*
better
than
an
imposition
,
which
God
had
put
upon
her
and
her
husband
*NL*
not
to
eat
of
that
fair
fruit
which
he
had
created
;
that
the
taste
*NL*
thereof
would
make
them
immortal
like
God
himself
;
and
consequently
as
*NL*
great
and
powerful
as
he
.
Upon
which
she
not
only
eat
thereof
herself
,
*NL*
but
made
her
husband
eat
also
,
which
brought
them
both
under
the
*NL*
heavenly
displeasure
.

Friday
expressed
a
great
concern

said
I
,
`
God
still
loved
mankind
,
and
though
the
devil
tempted
*NL*
human
nature
so
far
,
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
have
an
absolute
power
*NL*
over
them
.
I
have
told
you
before
of
his
tender
love
to
his
people
,
till
*NL*
they
,
like
Lucifer
,
disobeyed
his
commands
and
rebelled
against
him
;
and
*NL*
even
then
,
how
Jesus
Christ
,
his
only
Son
,
came
to
save
sinners
.
But
*NL*
still
every
man
that
lives
in
the
world
is
under
temptation
and
trial
.
*NL*
The
devil
has
yet
a
power
,
as
prince
of
the
air
,
to
suggest
evil
*NL*
cogitations
in
our
minds
,
and
prompt
us
on
to
wicked
actions
,
that
he
*NL*
might
glory
in
our
destruction
.
Whatever
evil
thoughts
we
have
,
proceed
*NL*
from
him
;
so
that
God
in
this
our
distress
,
expects
we
should
apply
*NL*
ourselves
to
him
by
fervent
prayer
for
speedy
redress
.
He
is
not
like
*NL*
_
Benamuckee
,
_
to
let
none
come
near
him
but
_
Oowakakee
_
,
but
suffers
the
*NL*
people
as
well
as
priests
to
offer
themselves
at
his
feet
,
thereby
to
be
*NL*
delivered
from
the
power
and
temptation
of
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
at
first
my
man
Friday
expressed
some
concern
at
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
Lucifer
,
I
found
it
not
so
easy
to
imprint
the
right
*NL*
notions
of
him
in
his
mind
,
as
it
was
about
the
divine
essence
of
God
;
*NL*
for
there
nature
assisted
me
in
all
my
arguments
,
to
show
him
plainly
*NL*
the
necessity
of
a
great
first
cause
,
and
over-ruling
,
governing
power
,
*NL*
of
a
secret
directing
Providence
,
and
of
the
equity
and
reasonableness
*NL*
of
paying
adoration
to
our
Creator
:
whereas
there
appeared
nothing
of
*NL*
all
this
in
the
notion
of
an
evil
spirit
,
of
his
first
beginning
,
his
*NL*
nature
,
and
,
above
all
,
of
his
inclination
to
evil
actions
,
and
his
*NL*
power
to
tempt
us
to
the
like
.
And
indeed
this
unlearned
_
Indian
_
,
by
*NL*
the
mere
force
of
nature
,
puzzled
me
with
one
particular
question
,
more
*NL*
than
ever
I
could
have
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
,
it
seems
,
one
day
,
been
talking
to
him
of
the
omnipotent
power
of
*NL*
God
,
and
his
infinite
abhorrence
of
sin
,
insomuch
that
the
Scriptures
*NL*
styled
him
_
a
consuming
fire
_
to
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
;
and
that
*NL*
it
was
in
his
power
,
whenever
he
pleased
,
to
destroy
all
the
world
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
the
greater
part
of
which
are
continually
offending
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
with
a
serious
attention
,
he
had
listened
a
great
while
to
what
*NL*
I
said
,
after
I
had
been
telling
him
how
the
devil
was
God
's
enemy
in
*NL*
the
hearts
of
men
,
and
used
all
his
malice
and
skill
to
defeat
the
good
*NL*
designs
of
Providence
,
and
destroy
the
kingdom
of
Christ
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
so
forth
:
_
Very
well
,
Master
_
,
said
Friday
,
_
you
say
God
is
so
*NL*
strong
,
so
great
,
is
he
not
much
strong
,
much
mightier
than
the
naughty
*NL*
devil
?
_
``
To
be
sure
,
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
God
is
more
wise
and
stronger
*NL*
than
the
serpent
:
he
is
above
the
devil
,
which
makes
us
pray
to
him
,
*NL*
that
he
would
tread
down
Satan
under
his
feet
,
enable
us
to
resist
the
*NL*
violent
temptations
;
and
quench
his
fiery
darts
.
''
_
Why
then
_
,
answered
*NL*
Friday
quickly
,
_
if
God
,
as
you
say
,
has
much
strong
,
much
might
as
the
*NL*
devil
,
why
God
no
kill
devil
,
make
no
more
tempt
,
no
more
do
wicked
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
be
certain
,
I
was
strangely
surprised
at
this
question
of
my
*NL*
man
's
:
and
,
though
an
old
man
,
I
was
but
a
young
doctor
,
and
*NL*
consequently
very
ill
qualified
for
a
causuist
,
or
a
resolver
of
*NL*
intricate
doubts
in
religion
,
and
as
it
required
some
time
for
me
to
*NL*
study
for
an
answer
,
I
pretended
not
to
hear
him
,
nor
to
ask
him
what
he
*NL*
said
;
but
,
to
so
earnest
was
he
for
an
answer
,
as
not
to
forget
his
*NL*
question
which
he
repeated
in
the
very
same
broken
words
as
above
.
When
*NL*
I
had
recovered
myself
a
little
,
``
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
God
will
at
last
*NL*
punish
him
severely
,
being
reserved
for
judgment
,
and
is
to
be
cast
into
*NL*
the
bottomless
pit
,
to
remain
in
fire
everlasting
.
''
But
all
this
did
not
*NL*
satisfy
Friday
,
for
,
returning
upon
me
,
he
repeated
my
words
``
RESERVE
AT
*NL*
LAST
,
_
me
no
understand
;
but
,
why
not
kill
devil
now
,
not
kill
devil
,
*NL*
great
,
great
while
ago
_
?
''
``
Friday
''
said
I
``
you
may
as
well
ask
me
why
*NL*
God
does
not
kill
you
and
me
,
when
,
by
our
wicked
actions
,
we
so
much
*NL*
offend
his
divine
Majesty
?
He
gives
us
time
to
repent
of
our
sins
,
that
*NL*
thereby
we
may
obtain
pardon
.
''
At
these
words
_
obtain
pardon
_
,
Friday
*NL*
mused
a
great
while
;
and
,
at
last
,
looking
me
stedfastly
in
the
face
,
*NL*
_
Well
,
well
_
,
said
he
,
_
that
's
very
well
;
so
you
,
I
,
devil
,
all
wicked
*NL*
mans
,
all
preserve
,
repent
,
God
pardon
all
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
here
I
was
ran
down
to
the
last
extremity
,
when
it
became
very
*NL*
evident
to
me
;
how
mere
natural
notions
will
guide
reasonable
creatures
*NL*
to
the
knowledge
of
a
Deity
,
and
to
the
homage
due
to
the
Supreme
Being
*NL*
of
God
;
but
,
however
,
nothing
but
divine
revelation
can
form
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
Jesus
Christ
,
and
of
a
redemption
purchased
for
us
,
of
the
*NL*
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
,
and
of
an
intercessor
at
the
footstool
of
*NL*
God
's
throne
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
Gospel
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
;
that
is
,
the
word
and
Spirit
of
God
,
promised
for
the
guide
and
*NL*
the
sanctifier
of
his
people
,
are
the
most
necessary
instructors
of
the
*NL*
souls
of
men
,
in
the
saving
knowledge
of
the
Almighty
,
and
the
means
to
*NL*
attain
eternal
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
found
it
necessary
to
put
an
end
to
this
discourse
between
my
*NL*
man
and
me
;
for
which
purpose
I
rose
up
hastily
,
and
made
as
if
I
had
*NL*
some
occasion
to
go
out
,
sending
Friday
for
something
that
was
a
good
*NL*
way
off
,
I
then
fell
on
my
knees
,
and
beseeched
God
that
he
would
*NL*
inspire
me
so
far
as
to
guide
this
poor
savage
in
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
Christ
,
to
answer
his
questions
more
clearly
,
that
his
conscience
might
*NL*
be
convinced
,
his
eyes
opened
,
and
his
soul
saved
.
When
he
returned
*NL*
again
,
I
entered
into
a
very
long
discourse
with
him
,
upon
the
subject
*NL*
of
the
world
's
redemption
by
the
Saviour
of
it
,
and
the
doctrine
of
*NL*
repentance
preached
from
heaven
,
together
with
an
holy
faith
of
our
*NL*
blessed
Redeemer
Jesus
Christ
;
and
then
I
proceeded
to
explain
to
him
,
*NL*
according
to
my
weak
capacity
,
the
reason
why
our
Saviour
took
not
on
*NL*
him
the
nature
of
angels
,
but
rather
the
seed
of
Abraham
;
and
how
the
*NL*
fallen
angels
had
no
benefit
by
that
redemption
;
and
,
lastly
,
that
he
*NL*
came
only
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
the
like
.
God
*NL*
knows
I
had
more
sincerity
than
knowledge
in
all
the
ways
I
took
for
the
*NL*
poor
Indian
's
instruction
;
and
,
I
must
acknowledge
what
I
believe
,
every
*NL*
body
that
acts
upon
the
same
principle
will
find
,
that
in
laying
*NL*
heavenly
truths
open
before
him
,
I
informed
and
instructed
myself
in
*NL*
many
things
that
either
I
did
not
know
,
or
had
not
perfectly
considered
*NL*
before
:
so
that
,
however
,
this
poor
creature
might
be
improved
by
my
*NL*
instructions
,
certain
it
is
,
that
I
myself
had
great
reason
to
be
*NL*
thankful
to
Providence
for
sending
him
to
me
.
His
company
allayed
my
*NL*
grief
,
and
made
my
habitation
comfortable
;
and
when
I
reflected
that
the
*NL*
solitary
life
to
which
I
had
been
so
long
confined
,
had
made
me
to
look
*NL*
further
towards
Heaven
,
by
making
me
the
instrument
under
Providence
,
to
*NL*
save
the
life
,
and
for
ought
I
know
,
the
soul
of
this
poor
savage
,
by
*NL*
bringing
him
to
the
knowledge
of
Jesus
Christ
,
it
caused
a
secret
joy
to
*NL*
spread
through
every
part
of
my
soul
;
and
I
frequently
rejoiced
,
that
*NL*
ever
I
was
brought
to
this
place
,
which
I
once
thought
the
most
*NL*
miserable
part
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
thankful
frame
of
mind
did
I
afterwards
continue
,
while
I
abode
*NL*
on
the
island
,
and
for
three
years
did
my
man
and
I
live
in
the
greatest
*NL*
enjoyment
of
happiness
.
Indeed
,
I
believe
the
savage
was
as
good
a
*NL*
Christian
as
I
;
and
I
hope
we
were
equally
penitent
;
and
such
penitents
*NL*
as
were
comforted
and
restored
by
God
's
Holy
Spirit
;
for
now
we
had
the
*NL*
word
of
the
Lord
to
instruct
us
in
the
right
way
,
as
much
as
if
we
had
*NL*
been
on
the
English
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
constant
application
I
made
to
the
Scriptures
,
as
I
read
them
to
*NL*
my
man
Friday
,
I
earnestly
endeavoured
to
make
him
understand
every
part
*NL*
of
it
,
as
much
as
lay
in
my
power
.
He
also
,
on
the
other
hand
,
by
his
*NL*
very
serious
questions
and
inquiries
,
made
me
a
much
better
proficient
*NL*
in
Scripture
knowledge
,
than
I
should
have
been
by
my
own
private
*NL*
reading
and
study
.
I
must
not
omit
another
thing
,
proceeding
from
the
*NL*
experience
I
had
in
my
retirement
:
It
was
that
infinite
and
*NL*
inexpressible
blessing
,
the
knowledge
of
God
through
Jesus
Christ
,
which
*NL*
was
so
plain
and
easy
to
be
understood
,
as
immediately
to
direct
me
to
*NL*
carry
on
the
great
work
of
sincere
repentance
for
my
sins
,
and
laying
*NL*
hold
of
a
Saviour
for
eternal
life
,
to
a
practical
stated
reformation
,
*NL*
and
obedience
to
all
God
's
institutions
,
without
the
assistance
of
a
*NL*
reverend
and
orthodox
divine
;
and
especially
by
this
same
instruction
,
*NL*
so
to
enlighten
this
savage
creature
,
as
to
make
him
so
good
a
*NL*
Christian
,
as
very
few
could
exceed
him
.
And
there
was
only
this
great
*NL*
thing
wanting
,
that
I
had
no
authority
to
administer
the
Holy
Sacrament
,
*NL*
that
heavenly
participation
of
Christ
's
body
and
blood
;
yet
,
however
,
we
*NL*
rested
ourselves
content
;
that
God
would
accept
our
desires
,
and
*NL*
according
to
our
faith
,
have
mercy
on
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
we
wanted
one
way
,
was
made
up
in
another
,
and
that
was
*NL*
universal
peace
in
our
little
church
.
We
had
no
disputes
and
wrangling
*NL*
about
the
nature
and
equality
of
the
holy
,
blessed
,
and
undivided
*NL*
Trinity
,
no
niceties
in
doctrine
,
or
schemes
of
church
government
;
no
*NL*
sour
or
morale
dissenters
to
impose
more
sublimated
notions
upon
us
;
no
*NL*
pedant
sophisters
to
confound
us
with
unintelligible
mysteries
:
but
,
*NL*
instead
of
all
this
,
we
enjoyed
the
most
certain
guide
to
Heaven
;
that
*NL*
is
,
the
word
of
God
:
besides
which
,
we
had
the
comfortable
views
of
his
*NL*
Spirit
leading
us
to
the
truth
,
and
making
us
both
willing
and
obedient
*NL*
to
the
instruction
of
his
word
.
As
the
knowledge
and
practice
of
this
*NL*
are
the
principal
means
of
salvation
,
I
can
not
see
what
it
avails
any
*NL*
christian
church
,
or
man
in
the
world
,
to
amuse
himself
with
*NL*
speculations
and
opinions
,
except
it
be
to
display
their
particular
*NL*
vanity
and
affectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
well
suppose
,
that
,
by
the
frequent
discourse
we
had
together
,
*NL*
my
man
and
I
became
most
intimately
acquainted
,
and
that
their
was
but
*NL*
very
little
that
I
could
say
,
but
what
Friday
understood
;
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
he
spoke
very
fluently
,
though
it
was
but
broken
English
.
I
now
took
a
*NL*
particular
pleasure
in
relating
all
my
adventures
,
especially
those
that
*NL*
occurred
since
my
being
cast
on
this
island
.
I
made
him
understand
that
*NL*
wonderful
mystery
,
as
he
conceived
,
of
gunpowder
and
bullet
,
and
taught
*NL*
him
how
to
shoot
.
I
also
presented
to
him
a
knife
,
which
pleased
him
*NL*
exceedingly
,
making
him
a
belt
,
with
a
frog
hanging
thereto
,
like
those
*NL*
in
which
we
wear
hangers
in
England
;
and
,
instead
of
a
hanger
to
put
in
*NL*
the
frog
,
I
gave
him
a
hatchet
,
which
was
not
only
as
good
,
but
even
a
*NL*
better
weapon
upon
many
occasions
.
In
a
word
,
my
man
thus
accoutred
,
*NL*
looked
upon
himself
as
great
as
Don
Quixote
,
when
that
celebrated
*NL*
champion
went
to
combat
the
windmill
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
next
gave
him
a
very
particular
description
of
the
territories
of
*NL*
Europe
,
and
in
a
particular
manner
of
Old
England
,
the
place
of
my
*NL*
nativity
.
I
laid
,
before
him
the
manner
of
our
worshipping
God
,
our
*NL*
behaviour
one
to
another
,
and
how
we
trade
in
ships
to
every
part
of
the
*NL*
universe
.
I
then
told
him
my
misfortunes
in
being
shipwrecked
,
showing
*NL*
him
,
as
near
as
I
could
the
place
where
the
ship
lay
,
which
had
been
*NL*
gone
long
before
;
but
I
brought
him
to
the
ruins
of
my
boat
which
before
*NL*
my
whole
strength
could
not
move
,
but
now
was
a
most
rotten
,
and
fallen
*NL*
to
pieces
.
I
observed
my
man
Friday
to
view
this
boat
with
uncommon
*NL*
curiosity
;
which
,
when
he
had
done
,
he
stood
pondering
a
great
while
,
*NL*
and
said
nothing
.
At
last
,
said
I
,
``
Friday
,
what
makes
you
ponder
so
*NL*
much
?
''
He
replied
,
_
O
master
,
me
see
like
boat
come
to
place
at
*NL*
my
nation
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
,
indeed
,
before
I
understood
what
my
man
meant
;
but
*NL*
examining
strictly
into
it
,
I
plainly
found
,
that
such
another
boat
*NL*
resembling
mine
,
had
come
up
on
the
country
where
he
dwelt
:
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
by
his
farther
explanation
,
that
the
boat
was
driven
there
through
*NL*
stress
of
weather
.
It
then
came
into
my
mind
that
some
European
ship
*NL*
having
been
cast
away
,
the
poor
distressed
creatures
were
forced
to
have
*NL*
recourse
to
the
boat
to
save
their
lives
;
and
being
all
,
as
I
thought
*NL*
drowned
,
I
never
concerned
my
self
to
ask
any
thing
concerning
,
them
,
*NL*
but
my
only
inquiry
was
about
the
boat
,
and
what
description
my
man
*NL*
could
give
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
Friday
answered
my
demands
very
well
;
making
everything
very
*NL*
plain
to
my
understanding
:
but
beyond
measure
was
I
satisfied
,
when
he
*NL*
told
me
with
great
warmth
and
ardour
.
_
O
master
,
we
save
white
mans
from
*NL*
drown
;
_
upon
which
I
immediately
asked
him
,
If
there
were
any
white
*NL*
mans
,
as
he
called
them
in
the
boat
?
_
Yes
,
yes
_
,
said
he
,
_
the
boat
*NL*
full
,
very
full
of
white
mans
_
``
How
many
,
Friday
?
''
said
I.
Hereupon
he
*NL*
numbered
his
fingers
,
and
counted
seventeen
.
And
when
I
asked
him
what
*NL*
became
of
them
all
,
and
whether
they
lived
or
not
?
he
replied
,
_
Yes
*NL*
master
,
they
all
live
,
they
be
live
among
my
nation
.
_
This
information
*NL*
put
fresh
thoughts
into
my
head
,
that
these
must
be
those
very
men
who
*NL*
before
I
concluded
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
ocean
,
after
they
had
*NL*
left
the
ship
that
had
struck
upon
the
rocks
of
my
kingdom
,
and
after
*NL*
escaping
the
fury
of
the
deep
,
landed
upon
the
wild
shore
,
and
committed
*NL*
themselves
to
the
fury
of
the
devouring
Indians
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
of
their
cruelties
to
one
another
,
which
consequently
,
as
I
*NL*
thought
,
must
be
acted
with
greater
barbarity
to
strangers
,
created
in
*NL*
me
a
great
anxiety
,
and
made
me
still
more
curious
to
ask
Friday
*NL*
concerning
them
.
He
told
me
,
he
was
sure
they
still
lived
there
,
having
*NL*
resided
among
them
above
four
years
,
and
that
the
savages
gave
them
*NL*
victuals
to
live
upon
:
``
But
pray
,
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
whence
proceeded
all
*NL*
this
good
nature
and
generosity
?
How
came
it
to
pass
that
they
did
not
*NL*
kill
and
eat
them
,
to
please
their
devouring
appetites
,
and
occasion
to
*NL*
splendid
an
entertainment
among
them
?
''
_
No
,
no
,
_
said
Friday
,
_
they
not
*NL*
kilt
'em
,
they
make
brothers
with
'em
_
;
by
which
I
understood
there
was
*NL*
a
truce
between
them
.
And
then
I
had
a
more
favourable
opinion
of
the
*NL*
Indians
,
upon
Friday
uttering
these
words
,
_
My
nation
,
t
`
other
nation
no
*NL*
eat
man
,
but
when
mans
,
make
war
fight
:
_
as
though
he
had
said
,
that
*NL*
neither
those
of
his
kingdom
,
nor
any
other
nations
that
he
knew
of
,
*NL*
ever
ate
their
fellow-creatures
,
but
such
as
their
law
of
arms
allowed
*NL*
to
be
devoured
;
that
is
,
those
miserable
captives
,
whose
misfortune
it
*NL*
should
be
to
be
made
prisoners
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
considerable
time
after
,
upon
a
very
pleasant
day
,
in
most
serene
*NL*
weather
,
my
man
and
I
stood
upon
the
top
of
a
hill
,
on
the
east
side
of
*NL*
the
island
,
whence
I
had
once
before
beheld
the
continent
of
America
.
I
*NL*
could
not
tell
immediately
what
was
the
matter
,
for
suddenly
Friday
fell
*NL*
a
jumping
and
dancing
as
if
he
had
been
mad
,
and
upon
my
demanding
the
*NL*
reason
of
his
behaviour
,
_
O
joy
_
!
said
he
,
_
O
glad
!
there
see
my
*NL*
country
,
there
my
nation
,
there
live
white
mans
gether
_
.
And
indeed
such
*NL*
a
rapturous
sense
of
pleasure
appeared
in
his
countenance
that
his
eyes
*NL*
had
an
uncommon
sparkling
and
brightness
,
and
such
a
strange
eagerness
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
a
longing
desire
to
be
in
his
country
again
.
This
made
me
*NL*
no
so
well
satisfied
with
my
man
Friday
as
before
;
for
by
this
*NL*
appearance
,
I
made
no
dispute
,
but
that
if
he
could
get
back
thither
*NL*
again
,
he
would
not
only
be
unmindful
of
what
religion
I
had
taught
him
,
*NL*
but
likewise
of
the
great
obligation
he
owed
me
for
his
wonderful
*NL*
deliverance
;
nay
,
that
he
would
not
only
inform
his
countrymen
of
me
,
*NL*
but
accompany
hundreds
of
them
to
my
kingdom
,
and
make
me
a
miserable
*NL*
sacrifice
like
those
unhappy
wretches
taken
in
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
I
was
very
much
to
blame
to
have
those
cruel
and
unjust
*NL*
suspicions
,
and
must
freely
own
I
wronged
the
poor
creature
very
much
,
*NL*
who
was
of
a
quite
contrary
temper
.
And
had
he
had
that
discerning
*NL*
acuteness
which
many
Europeans
have
,
he
would
certainly
have
perceived
*NL*
my
coldness
and
indifference
,
and
also
have
been
very
much
concerned
*NL*
upon
that
account
;
as
I
was
now
more
circumspect
,
I
had
much
lessened
my
*NL*
kindness
and
familiarity
with
him
,
and
while
this
jealousy
continued
,
I
*NL*
used
that
artful
way
-LRB-
now
to
much
in
fashion
,
the
occasion
of
strife
and
*NL*
dissention
-RRB-
of
pumping
him
daily
thereby
to
discover
whether
he
was
*NL*
deceitful
in
his
thoughts
and
inclinations
;
but
certainly
he
had
nothing
*NL*
in
him
but
what
was
consistent
with
the
best
principles
,
both
as
a
*NL*
religious
Christian
and
a
grateful
friend
;
and
indeed
;
I
found
every
*NL*
thing
he
said
was
ingenuous
and
innocent
,
that
I
had
no
room
for
*NL*
suspicion
,
and
,
in
spite
of
all
uneasiness
,
he
not
only
made
me
entirely
*NL*
his
own
again
,
but
also
caused
me
much
to
lament
that
I
ever
conceived
*NL*
one
ill
thought
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
walking
up
the
same
hill
another
day
,
when
the
weather
was
*NL*
so
hazy
at
sea
,
that
I
could
not
perceive
the
continent
,
``
Friday
,
''
said
*NL*
I
``
do
n't
you
wish
yourself
to
be
in
your
own
country
,
your
nation
,
among
*NL*
your
old
friends
and
acquaintances
?
''
_
Yes
,
_
said
he
,
_
me
much
O
glad
to
*NL*
be
at
my
own
nation
.
_
``
And
what
would
you
do
there
,
Friday
?
Would
you
*NL*
turn
wild
again
,
eat
man
's
flesh
,
and
be
a
savage
as
you
were
formerly
.
''
*NL*
_
No
,
no
,
_
-LRB-
answered
he
,
full
of
concern
and
making
his
head
-RRB-
_
Friday
now
*NL*
tell
them
to
live
good
,
tell
them
pray
God
,
tell
them
to
eat
corn
bread
,
*NL*
cattle
flesh
,
milk
,
no
eat
man
again
.
_
``
But
surely
,
''
replied
I
,
``
if
you
*NL*
should
offer
to
do
all
this
,
they
will
kill
you
;
and
to
manifest
their
*NL*
contempt
of
such
instruction
eat
you
up
when
they
have
done
.
''
He
then
*NL*
put
on
a
grave
,
yet
innocent
and
smooth
countenance
,
saying
,
_
No
,
they
*NL*
no
kill
me
,
they
willing
love
learn
_
:
that
is
that
they
would
be
very
*NL*
willing
to
learn
:
adding
withal
,
_
that
they
had
learned
much
of
the
*NL*
bearded
mans
that
came
in
the
boat
_
.
``
Will
you
,
''
said
I
``
go
back
again
,
*NL*
Friday
?
''
He
smiled
at
that
,
and
told
me
,
that
he
could
not
swim
so
far
.
*NL*
But
said
I
,
I
will
make
a
canoe
for
you
.
_
Yes
,
Master
_
said
he
,
_
me
go
*NL*
if
you
go
,
me
no
go
if
you
stay
_
.
``
I
go
,
Friday
!
why
would
you
have
them
*NL*
to
eat
me
up
,
and
devour
your
kind
master
?
''
_
No
no
_
,
said
he
,
_
me
make
*NL*
them
not
eat
master
,
and
me
make
them
much
love
you
_
;
that
is
,
he
would
*NL*
tell
them
how
I
had
slain
his
enemies
,
and
thereby
saved
his
life
,
for
*NL*
which
reason
he
would
make
them
love
me
:
and
then
he
related
to
me
,
as
*NL*
well
as
he
was
able
,
how
exceedingly
kind
those
his
nation
were
to
the
*NL*
white
,
or
bearded
men
,
as
he
called
them
,
who
,
in
their
great
calamity
,
*NL*
were
driven
into
their
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
from
this
time
,
indeed
,
I
had
strong
inclinations
to
venture
*NL*
over
,
and
use
my
utmost
efforts
,
if
possible
,
to
join
these
white
*NL*
bearded
men
,
who
undoubtedly
were
Spaniards
or
Portuguese
;
for
,
thought
*NL*
I
,
it
must
be
certainly
a
better
and
safer
way
to
escape
when
there
is
a
*NL*
good
company
,
than
for
me
alone
,
from
an
island
forty
miles
off
the
*NL*
shore
,
and
without
any
assistance
.
Some
days
,
after
,
Friday
and
I
being
*NL*
at
work
,
as
usual
,
at
the
same
time
diverting
ourselves
with
various
*NL*
discourses
;
I
told
him
I
had
a
boat
which
I
would
bestow
upon
him
,
*NL*
whenever
he
pleased
to
return
to
his
own
nation
;
and
to
convince
him
of
*NL*
the
truth
of
what
I
said
,
I
took
him
with
me
to
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
island
,
where
my
frigate
lay
,
and
then
taking
it
from
under
the
water
,
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
always
kept
it
sunk
for
fear
of
a
discovery
-RRB-
we
went
both
into
it
*NL*
to
see
how
it
would
manage
such
an
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
really
never
could
any
be
more
dexterous
in
rowing
than
my
faithful
*NL*
servant
,
making
the
boat
go
as
fast
again
as
I
could
.
``
Well
now
,
*NL*
Friday
''
,
said
I
,
``
shall
we
now
go
to
your
so
much
admired
nation
.
''
But
*NL*
instead
of
meeting
with
that
cheerfulness
I
expected
,
he
looked
very
*NL*
dull
and
melancholy
at
my
saying
so
;
which
indeed
at
first
surprised
*NL*
me
,
till
he
made
me
sensible
,
that
his
concern
was
about
the
boat
's
*NL*
being
too
small
to
go
so
far
a
voyage
.
Upon
which
I
let
him
understand
I
*NL*
had
a
much
bigger
;
and
accordingly
,
the
next
day
went
to
the
place
where
*NL*
the
first
boat
lay
,
which
I
had
made
,
when
all
the
strength
I
had
or
art
*NL*
I
could
use
failed
me
in
my
attempt
to
get
it
into
the
water
:
but
now
it
*NL*
having
lain
in
the
sun
two
and
twenty
years
,
and
no
care
being
taken
of
*NL*
it
all
that
while
,
it
became
in
a
manner
rotten
.
My
man
told
me
,
that
*NL*
such
a
boat
would
do
very
well
for
the
purpose
,
sufficient
to
carry
*NL*
_
enough
vittle
,
drink
,
bread
_
,
for
that
was
his
manner
of
talking
.
In
*NL*
short
,
my
mind
being
strongly
fixed
upon
my
design
of
going
over
with
*NL*
him
to
the
Continent
,
I
very
plainly
told
him
that
we
would
both
go
and
*NL*
make
a
boat
full
as
big
,
and
more
proportionable
than
that
,
wherein
he
*NL*
might
safely
return
to
his
own
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
made
Friday
look
so
very
pensive
that
I
thought
he
would
*NL*
have
fallen
at
my
feet
.
It
was
some
time
before
he
could
speak
a
word
,
*NL*
which
made
me
ask
him
,
what
was
the
matter
with
him
?
He
replied
in
a
*NL*
very
soft
and
moving
tone
,
_
What
has
poor
Friday
done
?
why
are
you
angry
*NL*
mad
with
poor
servant
?
What
me
done
,
O
what
me
done
?
_
``
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
you
never
yet
have
offended
me
,
what
makes
you
think
I
am
angry
with
*NL*
you
,
when
I
am
not
angry
at
all
.
''
_
You
no
angry
,
no
angry
,
_
said
he
*NL*
several
times
,
_
if
you
be
no
angry
,
why
den
send
Friday
over
great
water
*NL*
to
my
own
nation
?
_
``
Why
from
a
mountain
you
beheld
the
place
where
you
*NL*
was
born
,
and
is
it
not
to
satisfy
your
desires
that
I
am
willing
to
*NL*
give
you
leave
to
return
thither
?
''
_
Yes
,
yes
_
,
said
Friday
,
_
me
wish
to
*NL*
be
there
sure
enough
,
but
then
me
with
master
there
too
:
no
wish
Friday
*NL*
there
,
no
master
there
.
_
In
short
,
he
could
not
endure
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
going
there
without
me
.
``
I
go
there
!
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
what
shall
I
do
*NL*
there
?
''
He
answered
very
quickly
,
_
O
master
you
do
great
deal
much
good
,
*NL*
you
teach
all
de
wild
mans
to
be

to
be

sober

to
know
God
,
and
pray
God

_
``
Alas
!
poor
Friday
,
''
*NL*
said
I
,
``
what
can
I
do
against
their
priests
of
_
Benamuckee
_
,
or
indeed
*NL*
what
good
can
I

your
nation
sensible
of

when
I
myself
am
but

*NL*
poor
ignorant
man

''
_
No

no

master
,
_
said
he
,
_
you
be
no

_
``
You
shall
go
without

*NL*
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
I
do
n't
care
to
accompany
you
thither
;
I
would
*NL*
rather
live
in
this
solitude
than
venture
among
such
inhuman
savages
.
*NL*
_
Go
your
way
since
you
desire
it
,
and
leave
me
alone
by
myself
as
I
was
*NL*
before
I
saved
your
life
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
was
any
creature
more
thunderstruck
than
Friday
was
at
these
*NL*
words
.
_
Go
me
away
,
leave
master
away
,
-LRB-
said
he
after
a
long
silence
,
-RRB-
*NL*
no
,
no
,
Friday
die
,
Friday
live
not
master
gone
_
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
said
,
I
neither
can
nor
will
live
,
if
my
master
sends
me
from
him
.
And
*NL*
here
I
can
not
but
take
notice
of
the
strong
ties
of
friendship
,
which
*NL*
many
times
surpass
those
of
consanguinity
:
For
often
we
find
a
great
*NL*
disagreement
among
kindred
;
and
when
there
is
any
seeming
regard
for
*NL*
each
other
,
it
is
very
seldom
true
,
and
scarce
ever
lasting
,
if
powerful
*NL*
interest
does
not
bear
the
sway
;
and
that
alone
is
often
the
occasion
of
*NL*
the
greatest
hatred
in
the
world
,
which
is
to
desire
the
death
of
*NL*
parents
and
relations
,
for
the
sake
of
acquiring
their
fortunes
.
But
*NL*
there
was
no
such
thing
between
my
servant
and
me
;
instead
of
which
*NL*
there
was
the
greatest
gratitude
and
the
most
sincere
love
;
he
found
me
*NL*
not
only
his
deliverer
,
but
his
preserver
and
comforter
;
not
a
severe
*NL*
and
cruel
tyrant
,
but
a
kind
,
loving
,
and
affable
friend
.
He
wanted
for
*NL*
no
manner
of
sustenance
;
and
when
he
was
ill
or
out
of
order
,
I
was
his
*NL*
physician
,
not
only
for
his
body
but
his
soul
;
and
therefore
no
wonder
*NL*
was
it
,
that
such
an
innocent
creature
long
since
divested
of
his
former
*NL*
natural
cruelty
,
should
have
an
uncommon
concern
at
so
cruel
a
*NL*
seperation
from
me
,
which
pierced
him
to
the
very
soul
,
and
made
him
*NL*
desire
even
to
die
,
rather
than
live
without
me
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
told
Friday
,
in
a
very
careless
manner
,
that
he
should
be
at
*NL*
his
liberty
as
soon
as
the
boat
was
made
,
the
language
of
his
eyes
*NL*
expressed
all
imaginable
confusion
;
when
,
immediately
running
to
one
of
*NL*
his
hatchets
,
which
he
used
to
wear
as
a
defensive
weapon
,
he
gives
it
*NL*
into
my
hand
,
with
a
heart
so
full
,
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
.
*NL*
`
Friday
,
'
said
I
,
`
what
is
it
you
mean
?
What
must
I
do
with
this
?
'
_
Only
*NL*
kill
Friday
_
,
said
he
,
_
Friday
care
not
live
long
.
_
'
`
But
what
must
I
*NL*
kill
you
for
?
replied
I
again
,
_
Ah
!
dear
master
,
what
made
you
Friday
*NL*
save
from
eat
a
me
up
,
so
keep
long
Friday
,
make
Friday
love
God
,
and
*NL*
love
not
Benamuckee
,
and
now
Friday
send
away
;
never
see
Friday
more
.
_
*NL*
As
though
the
poor
creature
had
said
,
Alas
!
my
dearest
kind
master
,
how
*NL*
comes
it
to
pass
,
that
after
having
ventured
your
precious
life
to
save
*NL*
me
from
the
jaws
of
devouring
cannibals
,
like
myself
,
after
such
a
*NL*
tender
regard
to
provide
for
me
such
a
comfortable
nourishment
,
and
*NL*
continuing
so
long
a
kind
master
,
and
a
most
sincere
friend
;
and
after
*NL*
making
me
forsake
the
false
notion
of
an
Indian
Deity
,
and
worship
the
*NL*
true
God
in
spirit
and
in
truth
;
and
after
all
this
how
comes
it
now
,
*NL*
that
you
are
willing
to
send
me
away
to
my
former
course
of
living
,
by
*NL*
which
means
undoubtedly
we
shall
be
dead
to
each
other
;
but
greater
must
*NL*
be
my
misfortune
,
that
I
shall
never
behold
my
best
friend
I
have
in
the
*NL*
world
any
more
.
And
this
undoubtedly
,
though
he
could
not
express
*NL*
himself
so
clearly
,
must
be
his
sentiments
;
for
the
tears
ran
down
his
*NL*
cheeks
in
such
a
plentiful
manner
,
that
I
had
much
ado
to
refrain
from
*NL*
weeping
also
,
when
I
beheld
the
poor
creature
's
affection
;
so
that
I
was
*NL*
forced
to
comfort
him
in
the
best
manner
I
could
,
which
I
did
,
by
*NL*
telling
him
,
if
he
was
content
to
abide
with
me
,
I
should
be
ever
*NL*
willing
to
keep
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Friday
's
grief
was
something
abated
,
more
fully
to
convince
me
of
*NL*
his
affection
,
he
said
,
_
O
master
,
me
not
care
to
be
in
my
nation
,
leave
*NL*
you
here
;
me
desire
nation
learn
good
,
that
's
all
;
_
meaning
,
that
his
*NL*
desire
was
for
the
conversion
of
that
barbarous
people
.
But
as
I
had
no
*NL*
apostolic
mission
,
nor
any
concern
about
their
salvation
;
so
I
had
not
*NL*
the
least
intention
or
desire
of
undertaking
it
;
and
the
strength
of
my
*NL*
inclination
,
in
order
to
escape
,
proceeded
chiefly
from
my
late
*NL*
discourse
with
Friday
,
about
these
seventeen
white
bearded
men
,
that
had
*NL*
been
driven
upon
the
Barbarian
coast
;
whom
I
designed
to
join
,
as
the
*NL*
only
means
to
further
our
escape
.
To
which
intent
my
man
and
I
went
to
*NL*
search
for
a
proper
tree
to
fell
,
whereof
we
might
make
a
large
perigua
*NL*
or
canoe
,
to
undertake
the
voyage
;
and
,
indeed
,
we
were
not
long
in
*NL*
finding
one
fit
for
our
purpose
,
there
being
enough
of
wood
in
the
*NL*
island
to
have
built
a
fleet
of
large
vessels
,
but
the
thing
we
*NL*
principally
wanted
was
to
get
one
so
near
the
water
,
that
we
might
*NL*
launch
it
after
it
was
finished
,
and
not
commit
so
horrid
a
mistake
as
I
*NL*
had
once
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
after
a
great
search
for
what
was
best
and
most
convenient
,
*NL*
Friday
,
at
last
,
whose
judgment
in
such
affairs
was
much
superior
to
*NL*
mine
,
pitches
upon
a
kind
of
wood
the
most
fitting
for
it
.
To
this
day
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
the
name
of
the
tree
,
nor
describe
it
any
other
way
,
than
*NL*
only
by
saying
,
that
it
is
like
what
we
call
_
fustic
_
,
or
between
that
*NL*
and
the
Niacaragua
wood
,
being
much
of
the
same
colour
and
smell
.
But
*NL*
though
my
man
exceeded
me
in
the
knowledge
of
the
most
proper
tree
,
yet
*NL*
I
shewed
him
a
much
better
and
clearer
way
to
make
a
canoe
than
ever
he
*NL*
knew
before
;
for
he
was
for
burning
the
hollow
or
cavity
of
the
tree
,
in
*NL*
order
to
make
this
boat
;
but
I
then
told
him
how
he
might
do
it
with
*NL*
tools
,
learning
him
at
the
same
time
how
to
use
them
,
which
indeed
he
*NL*
did
very
dexterously
;
so
that
in
a
month
's
time
we
finished
it
,
making
*NL*
it
very
handsome
,
by
cutting
the
outside
in
the
true
shape
of
a
boat
.
*NL*
After
this
it
took
us
a
full
fortnight
before
we
could
get
her
into
the
*NL*
water
,
which
we
did
as
it
were
inch
by
inch
,
upon
great
rollers
;
but
*NL*
when
she
was
in
,
she
would
have
carried
twenty
men
,
with
all
the
ease
*NL*
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
very
well
pleased
,
you
may
be
sure
at
the
launching
of
this
man
*NL*
of
war
of
mine
,
I
was
no
less
amazed
to
behold
with
what
dexterity
my
*NL*
man
would
manage
her
,
turn
her
,
and
paddle
her
along
.
`
Well
Friday
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
?
Do
you
think
this
will
carry
us
*NL*
over
?
_
Yes
,
master
_
,
said
he
,
_
me
venture
over
well
,
though
great
blow
*NL*
wind
_
.
But
my
design
was
yet
farther
,
which
he
was
insensible
of
;
and
*NL*
that
was
to
make
a
mast
and
a
sail
,
and
to
provide
her
with
an
anchor
*NL*
and
cable
.
As
to
a
mast
,
that
was
no
difficult
thing
at
all
to
procure
:
*NL*
so
I
fixed
upon
a
strait
young
cedar-tree
;
which
I
found
near
the
place
,
*NL*
great
plenty
of
it
abounding
in
the
island
;
and
setting
Friday
to
cut
it
*NL*
down
,
I
gave
him
particular
directions
how
to
shape
and
order
it
;
but
as
*NL*
to
the
sail
,
that
I
managed
myself
.
I
very
well
knew
I
had
some
old
*NL*
ones
,
or
pieces
of
sails
enough
,
which
had
lain
six
and
twenty
years
by
*NL*
me
;
but
not
being
careful
to
preserve
them
,
as
thinking
I
should
have
no
*NL*
occasion
to
use
them
any
more
,
when
I
came
to
overlook
them
I
found
them
*NL*
almost
all
rotten
,
except
two
;
and
with
these
I
went
to
work
,
and
after
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
aukward
tedious
stitching
for
want
of
needles
,
*NL*
at
length
I
finished
a
three-cornered
ugly
thing
,
like
those
which
our
*NL*
long
boats
use
,
and
which
I
very
well
knew
how
to
manage
,
especially
*NL*
since
it
was
like
that
which
I
had
in
my
patron
's
fishing
boat
,
when
,
*NL*
with
my
boy
Xury
,
I
made
my
escape
from
the
Barbarian
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
two
months
,
I
think
,
before
I
completed
this
work
,
that
is
,
*NL*
the
rigging
and
fitting
my
mast
and
sails
;
and
indeed
they
were
nicely
*NL*
done
,
having
made
a
small
stay
and
a
sail
,
or
a
foresail
to
it
,
to
*NL*
assist
,
if
we
should
turn
to
the
westward
;
and
what
is
still
more
,
I
*NL*
fixed
a
rudder
to
the
stern
of
her
,
to
steer
with
;
and
though
I
was
but
*NL*
a
very
indifferent
shipwright
,
yet
,
as
I
was
sensible
of
the
great
*NL*
usefulness
and
absolute
necessity
of
a
thing
like
this
,
I
applied
myself
*NL*
to
it
with
such
a
confident
application
,
that
at
last
I
accomplished
my
*NL*
design
;
but
what
with
the
many
dull
contrivances
I
had
about
it
,
and
the
*NL*
failure
of
many
things
,
it
cost
me
as
much
pains
in
ordering
as
in
*NL*
making
the
boat
.
Besides
when
all
this
was
done
,
I
had
my
man
to
teach
*NL*
what
belonged
to
its
navigation
;
for
though
he
very
well
understood
how
*NL*
to
paddle
a
canoe
along
,
he
was
an
utter
stranger
to
a
sail
and
a
*NL*
rudder
,
and
was
amazed
when
he
saw
me
work
the
boat
to
and
again
in
the
*NL*
sea
,
by
them
,
and
how
the
sail
gibbed
and
filled
this
way
or
that
way
,
*NL*
as
the
course
we
sailed
changed
.
After
some
time
and
a
little
use
,
I
*NL*
made
all
these
things
very
familiar
to
him
,
so
that
he
became
an
expert
*NL*
sailor
,
except
in
relation
to
the
compass
,
and
that
I
could
make
him
*NL*
understand
but
little
of
.
But
,
as
it
happened
,
there
was
seldom
occasion
*NL*
for
it
,
there
being
but
little
cloudy
weather
,
and
scarce
any
fog
in
*NL*
those
parts
;
the
stars
were
always
visible
in
the
night
,
and
the
shore
*NL*
perspicuous
by
day
,
except
in
the
rainy
season
,
which
confined
every
one
*NL*
to
his
habitation
.
Thus
entered
in
the
seven
and
twentieth
year
of
my
*NL*
reign
,
or
captivity
,
which
you
please
,
-LRB-
the
last
three
of
which
blessed
*NL*
with
the
company
of
my
man
Friday
,
ought
not
to
be
reckoned
-RRB-
I
kept
the
*NL*
anniversary
of
my
landing
here
with
the
same
thankfulness
to
God
,
for
*NL*
his
tender
mercies
,
as
I
did
before
;
and
certainly
,
as
I
had
great
*NL*
cause
for
a
thankful
acknowledgement
for
my
deliverance
at
first
,
I
had
*NL*
much
greater
now
for
such
singular
and
additional
testimonies
of
the
*NL*
care
of
Providence
over
me
,
in
all
my
distress
of
both
body
and
mind
,
*NL*
and
the
great
hopes
I
had
of
being
effectually
and
speedily
delivered
;
*NL*
for
I
had
a
strong
impression
upon
my
mind
,
that
I
should
not
be
another
*NL*
year
in
this
island
.
But
,
however
,
I
still
continued
on
with
my
*NL*
husbandry
,
digging
,
planting
,
and
fencing
,
as
usual
;
gathering
and
*NL*
curing
my
grapes
,
and
doing
all
other
things
that
were
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
rainy
season
beginning
to
come
on
,
obliged
me
to
keep
the
*NL*
longer
within
doors
;
but
before
this
I
brought
my
new
vessel
into
the
*NL*
creek
,
where
I
had
landed
my
rafts
from
the
ship
,
and
haling
her
up
to
*NL*
the
shore
,
I
ordered
my
man
Friday
to
dig
a
dock
sufficient
to
hold
her
*NL*
in
,
and
deep
enough
to
give
her
water
,
wherein
she
might
float
;
and
then
*NL*
when
the
tide
was
out
,
we
made
a
strong
dam
cross
the
end
of
it
,
to
keep
*NL*
out
the
water
;
by
which
means
she
lay
dry
,
as
to
the
tide
from
the
sea
;
*NL*
and
to
keep
the
rain
from
her
,
we
thatched
her
over
,
as
it
were
,
with
*NL*
boughs
of
trees
,
like
a
house
,
so
we
waited
for
the
months
of
November
*NL*
and
December
,
in
which
I
designed
to
venture
over
the
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
the
seasonable
weather
begin
to
draw
near
,
but
so
much
was
*NL*
I
elevated
with
this
new
designed
adventure
,
that
I
daily
prepared
for
*NL*
the
voyage
.
The
first
thing
I
thought
on
was
,
to
lay
by
a
certain
*NL*
quantity
of
provisions
,
as
a
sufficient
store
for
such
an
expedition
,
*NL*
intending
in
a
week
or
fortnight
's
time
to
open
the
dock
,
and
to
launch
*NL*
out
the
boat
for
that
purpose
.
But
one
morning
as
I
was
very
busy
upon
*NL*
something
necessary
for
this
occasion
,
I
called
Friday
to
me
,
and
bid
*NL*
him
go
to
the
seashore
,
and
see
if
he
could
find
a
turtle
or
tortoise
,
a
*NL*
thing
which
we
commonly
had
once
a
week
,
as
much
upon
account
of
the
*NL*
eggs
,
as
for
the
sake
of
the
flesh
.
He
had
not
been
long
gone
,
but
he
*NL*
came
running
back
,
as
though
he
was
pursued
for
life
,
and
as
if
it
were
*NL*
flew
over
my
outer-wall
,
or
fence
,
like
one
that
felt
not
the
ground
,
or
*NL*
steps
he
set
his
feet
on
;
and
before
I
had
time
to
enquire
the
reason
of
*NL*
this
precipitation
,
he
cries
out
,
_
O
dear
master
,
O
sorrow
,
sorrow
!
Bad
!
*NL*
O
bad
!
_
`
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
Friday
,
'
said
I.
_
O
yonder
,
yonder
!
_
*NL*
said
he
;
_
there
be
one
,
two
,
or
three
canoes
!
two
three
!
_
Surely
,
*NL*
thought
I
,
there
must
be
six
,
by
my
man
's
way
of
reckoning
;
but
on
a
*NL*
stricter
inquiry
,
I
found
there
were
but
three
.
`
Well
Friday
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
do
n't
be
terrified
,
I
warrant
you
we
will
not
only
defend
ourselves
*NL*
against
them
,
but
kill
the
most
of
these
cruel
savages
.
'
But
though
I
*NL*
comforted
him
in
the
best
manner
I
could
,
the
poor
creature
trembled
so
,
*NL*
that
I
scarce
knew
what
to
do
with
him
:
--
_
O
master
_
,
said
he
,
_
they
come
*NL*
look
Friday
,
cut
pieces
Friday
,
cut
a
me
up
_
.
`
Why
Friday
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
they
will
eat
me
up
as
well
as
you
,
and
my
danger
is
as
great
as
*NL*
yours
.
But
since
it
is
so
,
we
must
resolve
to
fight
for
our
lives
.
What
*NL*
say
you
?
Can
you
fight
Friday
?
_
Yes
,
-LRB-
said
he
,
very
faintly
-RRB-
me
shoot
,
me
*NL*
kill
what
I
can
,
but
there
come
a
great
many
number
.
_
`
That
's
no
matter
,
'
*NL*
said
I
again
,
`
our
guns
will
terrify
those
that
we
do
not
kill
:
I
am
*NL*
very
willing
to
stand
by
you
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
.
Now
tell
me
*NL*
if
you
will
do
the
like
by
me
,
and
,
obey
my
orders
in
whatsoever
I
*NL*
command
?
'
Friday
then
answered
,
_
O
master
,
me
loses
life
for
you
,
me
die
*NL*
when
you
bid
die
.
_
Thus
concluding
all
questions
concerning
his
*NL*
fidelity
,
immediately
I
fetched
him
a
good
dram
of
rum
,
-LRB-
of
which
I
had
*NL*
been
a
very
good
husband
-RRB-
and
gave
it
him
to
comfort
his
heart
.
After
he
*NL*
had
drank
it
,
I
ordered
him
to
take
the
two-fowling
pieces
,
which
we
*NL*
always
carried
,
and
load
them
with
large
swan-shot
,
as
big
as
small
*NL*
pistol
bullets
;
then
I
took
four
muskets
,
and
loaded
them
with
two
slugs
*NL*
and
five
small
bullets
each
;
charging
my
two
pistols
each
with
a
brace
;
*NL*
I
hung
my
great
sword
,
as
customary
,
naked
to
my
side
,
and
gave
Friday
*NL*
his
hatchet
,
as
a
most
excellent
weapon
for
defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
prepared
,
I
thought
as
well
of
myself
,
as
any
knight
errant
that
*NL*
ever
handled
a
sword
and
spear
.
I
took
my
perspective
glass
and
went
up
*NL*
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
to
see
what
I
could
discover
;
and
I
perceived
*NL*
very
soon
,
by
my
glass
,
that
there
were
one
and
twenty
savages
,
three
*NL*
prisoners
,
and
three
canoes
,
and
that
their
chief
concern
seemed
to
be
*NL*
the
triumphant
banquet
upon
the
three
poor
human
bodies
,
a
thing
which
*NL*
by
this
time
I
had
observed
was
very
common
with
them
.
I
also
remarked
,
*NL*
that
they
did
not
land
at
that
place
from
whence
Friday
made
his
escape
,
*NL*
but
nearer
to
the
creek
,
where
the
shore
was
low
,
and
where
a
thick
wood
*NL*
came
very
close
to
the
sea
.
My
soul
was
then
filled
with
indignation
and
*NL*
abhorrence
at
such
inhuman
wretches
,
which
put
a
period
to
all
my
former
*NL*
thoughts
in
their
vindication
,
neither
would
I
give
myself
time
to
*NL*
consider
their
right
of
conquest
,
as
I
had
done
before
:
but
descending
*NL*
from
the
mountain
,
I
came
down
to
Friday
,
and
told
him
,
I
was
resolved
*NL*
to
go
speedily
to
them
,
and
kill
them
all
;
asking
him
again
in
the
same
*NL*
breath
,
if
he
would
stand
by
me
;
when
by
this
time
being
recovered
from
*NL*
his
fright
,
and
his
spirits
much
cheered
with
the
dram
I
had
given
him
,
*NL*
he
was
very
pleasant
,
yet
seriously
telling
me
,
as
he
did
before
,
_
When
*NL*
I
bid
die
,
he
would
die
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
it
was
,
having
fixed
my
resolution
in
so
strong
a
manner
,
that
*NL*
nothing
could
divest
my
breast
of
its
uncommon
fury
.
I
immediately
*NL*
divided
the
loaded
arms
betwixt
us
.
To
my
man
Friday
I
gave
a
pistol
to
*NL*
stick
in
his
girdle
,
with
three
guns
upon
his
shoulder
,
a
weight
too
*NL*
great
,
I
confess
,
to
bear
but
what
must
a
poor
king
do
,
who
has
but
one
*NL*
soldier
in
the
world
?
But
to
show
I
made
him
bear
no
more
than
what
I
*NL*
would
lay
on
myself
,
I
stuck
the
other
pistol
in
my
girdle
,
and
the
*NL*
other
three
guns
upon
my
shoulders
;
nay
,
something
more
,
but
that
was
*NL*
like
Aesop
's
burden
,
a
small
bottle
of
rum
,
which
was
soon
lightened
to
*NL*
our
exceeding
refreshment
.
Thus
we
marched
out
,
under
a
ponderous
load
*NL*
of
armour
,
like
two
invincible
champions
,
with
a
quantity
of
powder
and
*NL*
bullets
to
stand
our
battle
,
and
load
again
,
when
the
pieces
were
*NL*
discharged
.
And
now
my
orders
being
to
be
obeyed
,
I
charged
Friday
to
*NL*
keep
close
behind
me
,
and
not
to
stir
,
or
shoot
,
or
attempt
anything
*NL*
till
I
commanded
him
;
and
in
the
interim
,
not
to
speak
so
much
as
one
*NL*
word
.
It
was
in
this
order
I
fetched
a
compass
to
the
right
hand
,
of
*NL*
near
a
mile
,
as
well
to
get
over
the
creek
,
as
to
attain
the
wood
;
and
*NL*
by
this
,
I
thought
to
come
within
shot
of
them
before
I
could
be
*NL*
discerned
,
as
I
found
by
my
glass
,
would
not
be
difficult
to
accomplish
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
fickle
and
wavering
is
the
mind
of
man
,
even
in
our
greatest
*NL*
fury
and
strongest
inclinations
.
For
while
I
was
taking
this
march
,
my
*NL*
resolution
began
to
abate
,
not
through
fear
of
their
numbers
,
who
were
a
*NL*
parcel
of
naked
unarmed
wretches
,
but
those
reflections
occurred
to
my
*NL*
thoughts
:
_
what
power
was
I
commissioned
with
,
or
what
occasion
or
*NL*
necessity
had
I
to
go
and
imbrue
my
hands
in
human
blood
,
and
murder
*NL*
people
that
had
neither
done
nor
intended
to
do
me
any
wrong
?
They
were
*NL*
innocent
in
particular
as
to
me
:
and
their
barbarous
custom
was
not
only
*NL*
their
misfortune
but
a
sign
that
God
had
left
them
in
the
most
immense
*NL*
stupidity
;
but
yet
did
not
warrant
me
to
be
a
judge
of
their
actions
,
*NL*
much
less
an
executioner
of
his
righteous
judgments
?
That
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
whenever
he
thought
fit
,
he
would
take
vengeance
on
them
*NL*
himself
,
and
punish
them
in
a
national
way
,
according
to
their
national
*NL*
crimes
;
but
this
was
nothing
at
all
to
me
,
who
had
no
concern
with
them
.
*NL*
Indeed
my
man
Friday
might
justify
himself
,
because
they
were
his
*NL*
declared
enemies
,
of
that
very
same
nation
that
went
to
sacrifice
him
*NL*
before
;
and
indeed
it
was
lawful
for
him
to
attack
them
,
which
I
could
*NL*
not
say
was
so
with
respect
to
me
,
_
--
So
warmly
did
these
things
press
*NL*
upon
my
thoughts
all
the
way
I
went
,
that
I
only
resolved
to
place
*NL*
myself
so
as
to
behold
their
bloody
entertainment
,
without
falling
upon
*NL*
them
,
except
something
more
than
ordinary
,
by
God
's
special
direction
,
*NL*
should
oblige
me
thereto
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
fixed
in
my
resolution
,
I
entered
into
the
thick
wood
,
-LRB-
my
man
*NL*
Friday
following
me
close
behind
-RRB-
when
with
all
possible
wariness
and
*NL*
silence
,
I
marched
till
I
came
close
to
the
skirt
of
it
,
on
that
side
*NL*
which
was
the
nearest
to
them
;
for
only
one
end
of
the
wood
interposed
*NL*
between
me
and
them
.
Upon
which
I
called
very
softly
to
Friday
,
and
*NL*
shewing
him
a
great
tree
,
that
was
just
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
,
I
*NL*
ordered
him
to
repair
thither
,
and
bring
me
word
,
if
he
could
plainly
*NL*
perceive
their
actions
;
accordingly
he
did
as
I
commanded
him
,
and
came
*NL*
back
with
this
melancholy
story
,
_
that
they
were
all
about
their
fire
,
*NL*
eating
the
flesh
of
one
of
their
prisoners
;
and
that
another
lay
bound
*NL*
upon
the
sands
at
a
little
distance
from
them
,
which
they
designed
for
*NL*
the
next
sacrifice
,
and
this
,
he
told
me
was
not
one
of
their
nation
,
*NL*
but
one
of
those
very
bearded
men
,
who
were
driven
by
a
storm
into
their
*NL*
country
,
and
of
whom
he
had
so
often
talked
to
me
about
_
--
You
may
be
*NL*
sure
,
that
upon
hearing
this
,
my
soul
was
ready
to
sink
within
me
:
when
*NL*
ascending
into
a
tree
,
I
saw
plainly
,
by
my
glass
,
a
white
man
,
who
lay
*NL*
upon
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
with
his
hands
and
feet
tied
with
flags
,
or
*NL*
things
resembling
rushes
,
being
covered
with
clothes
,
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
an
European
.
From
the
tree
where
I
took
this
prospect
I
perceived
*NL*
another
tree
and
a
thicket
beyond
it
,
about
fifty
yards
nearer
to
them
*NL*
than
where
I
was
,
which
,
by
taking
a
small
circle
round
,
I
might
come
at
*NL*
undiscovered
,
&
then
I
should
be
within
half
a
shot
of
these
devourers
.
*NL*
And
this
consideration
alone
,
to
be
more
perfectly
revenged
upon
them
,
*NL*
made
me
withhold
my
passion
,
though
I
was
enraged
to
the
highest
degree
*NL*
imaginable
;
when
going
back
about
twenty
paces
I
got
behind
some
bushes
,
*NL*
which
held
all
the
way
till
I
came
to
the
other
tree
;
and
then
I
*NL*
ascended
to
a
little
rising
ground
,
not
above
eighteen
yards
distance
,
*NL*
and
there
I
had
a
full
view
of
these
creatures
,
and
I
could
perceive
all
*NL*
their
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
fight
did
then
appear
,
as
obliged
me
not
to
lose
a
moment
's
time
.
*NL*
No
less
than
nineteen
of
these
dreadful
wretches
sat
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
close
huddled
together
,
expressing
all
the
delight
imaginable
at
so
*NL*
barbarous
an
entertainment
;
and
they
had
just
sent
the
other
two
to
*NL*
murder
this
poor
unhappy
Christian
,
and
bring
him
limb
by
limb
to
their
*NL*
fire
;
for
they
were
then
just
going
to
untie
the
bands
from
his
feet
,
in
*NL*
order
for
death
,
as
fetters
are
knocked
off
the
feet
of
malefactors
*NL*
before
they
go
to
the
place
of
execution
.
Hereupon
,
immediately
turning
*NL*
to
my
man
,
`
now
,
Friday
'
said
I
`
mind
what
I
say
,
fail
in
nothing
,
but
*NL*
do
exactly
as
you
see
me
do
'
.
All
which
he
promising
--
he
would
perform
,
*NL*
I
let
down
one
of
my
muskets
,
and
fowling-piece
upon
the
ground
,
and
*NL*
Friday
did
the
same
by
his
;
and
with
the
other
musket
I
took
my
aim
at
*NL*
the
savages
,
bidding
him
do
the
like
:
`
Are
you
ready
'
said
I
:
_
Yes
,
*NL*
Master
,
_
said
he
;
`
why
then
fire
at
them
,
'
said
I
;
and
that
very
moment
*NL*
I
gave
fire
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
only
killed
one
and
wounded
two
;
but
my
man
Friday
,
taking
his
aim
*NL*
much
better
than
I
,
killed
two
and
wounded
three
.
You
may
be
sure
they
*NL*
were
in
a
dreadful
consternation
,
at
,
such
an
unexpected
disaster
,
and
*NL*
those
who
had
yet
escaped
our
penetrating
shot
,
immediately
jumped
upon
*NL*
their
feet
,
but
were
in
such
a
confusion
,
that
they
knew
not
which
way
*NL*
to
run
or
look
;
not
knowing
from
whence
their
destruction
came
.
We
threw
*NL*
down
our
pieces
,
and
took
up
others
,
giving
a
second
dreadful
volley
;
*NL*
but
as
they
were
loaded
only
with
swan
shot
,
or
small
pistol
bullets
,
we
*NL*
perceived
only
two
of
them
fall
;
tho
many
were
wounded
,
who
run
yelling
*NL*
and
screaming
about
like
mad
creatures
.
`
Now
,
Friday
,
'
said
I
,
`
lay
down
*NL*
your
piece
,
and
take
up
the
musket
,
and
follow
me
.
'
He
did
so
,
with
*NL*
great
courage
,
when
showing
ourselves
to
the
savages
we
give
a
great
*NL*
shout
,
and
made
directly
to
the
poor
victim
,
who
would
have
been
*NL*
sacrificed
,
had
not
our
first
fire
obliged
the
butchers
,
with
three
*NL*
others
,
to
jump
into
a
canoe
.
By
my
order
,
Friday
fired
at
them
,
at
*NL*
which
shot
I
thought
he
had
killed
them
all
,
by
reason
of
their
falling
*NL*
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
;
however
,
he
killed
two
,
and
mortally
wounded
*NL*
a
third
.
In
the
mean
time
,
I
cut
the
flags
that
tied
the
hands
and
feet
*NL*
of
the
poor
creature
,
and
lifting
him
up
asked
him
in
the
Portuguese
*NL*
tongue
,
_
What
he
was
?
_
He
answered
me
in
Latin
,
_
Christiantis
;
_
but
so
*NL*
very
weak
and
faint
,
that
he
could
scarce
stand
or
speak
.
Immediately
I
*NL*
gave
him
a
dram
;
and
a
piece
of
bread
to
cherish
him
,
and
asked
him
,
*NL*
What
countryman
he
was
?
He
said
,
_
Hispaniola
;
_
and
then
uttered
all
the
*NL*
thankfulness
imaginable
for
his
deliverance
.
`
Signior
,
'
said
I
,
with
as
*NL*
much
Spanish
as
I
was
master
of
,
`
let
us
talk
afterwards
,
but
fight
now
;
*NL*
here
,
take
this
sword
and
pistol
,
and
do
what
you
can
.
'
And
,
indeed
,
he
*NL*
did
so
with
much
courage
and
intrepidity
,
that
he
cut
two
of
them
to
*NL*
pieces
in
an
instant
,
the
savages
not
having
the
power
to
fly
for
their
*NL*
lives
.
I
ordered
Friday
to
run
for
those
pieces
we
had
left
at
the
tree
,
*NL*
which
he
brought
me
with
great
swiftness
,
and
then
I
gave
him
my
musket
,
*NL*
while
I
loaded
the
rest
.
But
now
their
happened
a
fierce
encounter
*NL*
between
the
Spaniard
&
one
of
the
savages
who
had
made
at
him
with
one
*NL*
of
their
wooden
swords
;
and
though
the
former
was
as
brave
as
could
be
*NL*
expected
,
having
twice
wounded
his
enemy
in
the
head
,
yet
being
weak
&
*NL*
faint
,
the
Indian
had
thrown
him
upon
the
ground
,
&
was
wrestling
my
*NL*
sword
out
of
his
hand
,
which
the
Spaniard
very
wisely
quiting
,
drew
out
*NL*
his
pistol
,
and
shot
him
through
the
body
before
I
could
come
near
him
,
*NL*
though
I
was
running
to
his
assistance
.
'
As
to
Friday
,
he
pursued
the
*NL*
flying
wretches
with
his
hatchet
,
dispatching
three
,
but
the
rest
were
*NL*
too
nimble
for
him
.
The
Spaniard
taking
one
of
the
fowling
pieces
,
*NL*
wounded
two
,
who
running
into
the
wood
Friday
pursued
and
killed
;
but
*NL*
the
other
,
notwithstanding
his
wounds
,
plunged
himself
into
the
sea
&
*NL*
swam
to
those
who
were
left
in
the
canoe
;
which
,
with
one
wounded
,
were
*NL*
all
that
escaped
out
of
one
and
twenty
.

The
savages
in
the
canoe
worked
very
hard
to
get
out
of
our
reach
,
and
*NL*
Friday
was
as
eager
in
pursuing
them
;
and
indeed
I
was
no
less
anxious
*NL*
about
their
escape
,
lest
after
the
news
had
been
carried
to
their
*NL*
people
,
they
should
return
in
multitudes
and
destroy
us
.
So
being
*NL*
resolved
to
pursue
them
,
I
jumped
into
one
of
the
canoes
and
bid
Friday
*NL*
follow
me
;
but
no
sooner
was
I
in
,
than
to
my
surprise
,
I
found
another
*NL*
poor
creature
bound
hand
and
foot
for
the
slaughter
,
just
as
the
*NL*
Spaniard
had
been
,
with
very
little
life
in
him
.
Immediately
I
unbound
*NL*
him
,
and
would
have
helped
him
up
;
but
he
could
neither
stand
nor
speak
,
*NL*
but
groaned
so
piteously
,
as
thinking
he
was
only
unbound
in
order
to
be
*NL*
slain
.
Hereupon
I
bid
Friday
speak
to
him
,
and
tell
him
of
his
*NL*
deliverance
;
when
pulling
out
my
bottle
I
made
the
poor
wretch
drink
a
*NL*
dram
;
which
,
with
the
joyful
news
he
had
received
,
so
revived
his
heart
*NL*
that
he
sat
up
in
the
boat
.
As
soon
as
Friday
began
to
hear
him
speak
,
*NL*
and
look
more
fully
in
his
face
,
it
would
have
moved
any
one
to
tears
to
*NL*
perceive
his
uncommon
transports
of
joy
;
for
he
kissed
,
embraced
him
,
*NL*
hugged
him
,
cried
,
laughed
,
hollooed
,
jumped
about
,
danced
,
sung
,
then
*NL*
cried
again
,
wrung
his
hands
,
beat
his
face
and
head
,
then
sung
and
*NL*
jumped
about
again
,
like
a
distracted
creature
;
so
that
it
was
a
great
*NL*
while
before
I
could
make
him
speak
to
me
,
or
tell
me
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
with
him
;
but
when
he
came
to
the
liberty
of
his
speech
at
last
,
*NL*
he
told
me
it
was
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
indeed
I
was
infinitely
moved
to
see
that
dutiful
and
tender
*NL*
affection
this
poor
savage
had
to
his
aged
parent
.
He
would
sit
down
by
*NL*
him
in
the
boat
,
open
his
breast
and
hold
his
father
's
head
close
to
his
*NL*
bosom
half
an
hour
together
to
cherish
him
:
then
he
took
his
arms
&
*NL*
ankles
,
which
were
stiff
and
numbed
with
binding
,
and
chaffed
and
rubbed
*NL*
them
with
his
hands
;
by
which
means
perceiving
what
the
case
was
,
I
gave
*NL*
him
some
rum
,
which
proved
of
great
benefit
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
busy
in
this
action
the
savages
had
gotten
almost
out
of
*NL*
sight
;
and
happy
it
was
we
did
not
pursue
them
:
For
there
arose
from
the
*NL*
north-west
,
which
continued
all
night
long
,
such
a
violent
storm
that
I
*NL*
could
not
suppose
otherwise
but
that
they
were
all
drowned
.
After
this
I
*NL*
called
Friday
to
me
,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
given
his
father
any
bread
?
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
and
said
,
_
None
,
not
one
bit
,
me
eat-a
up
all
;
_
so
I
*NL*
gave
him
a
cake
of
bread
out
of
a
little
pouch
I
carried
for
this
end
.
I
*NL*
likewise
gave
him
a
dram
for
himself
,
&
two
or
three
bunches
of
raisins
*NL*
for
his
father
.
Both
these
he
carried
to
him
,
for
he
would
make
him
*NL*
drink
the
dram
to
comfort
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
then
he
runs
out
of
the
boat
as
if
he
was
bewitched
,
with
such
an
*NL*
extraordinary
swiftness
,
that
he
was
out
of
sight
as
it
were
in
an
*NL*
instant
;
but
at
his
return
I
perceived
him
slacken
his
pace
,
because
he
*NL*
had
something
in
his
hand
.
And
this
I
found
to
be
as
he
approached
*NL*
nearer
,
an
earthen
jug
with
some
water
for
his
father
,
with
two
more
*NL*
cakes
of
bread
,
which
he
delivered
into
my
hands
.
Being
very
thirsty
*NL*
myself
I
drank
some
of
the
water
,
of
which
his
father
had
drank
*NL*
sufficiently
,
it
more
revived
his
spirits
than
all
the
rum
I
had
*NL*
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
called
Friday
to
me
and
ordered
him
to
carry
the
Spaniard
one
of
*NL*
the
cakes
and
some
water
,
who
was
reposing
himself
under
a
green
place
*NL*
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
but
so
weak
,
that
though
he
exerted
himself
*NL*
he
could
not
stand
upon
his
feet
.
Upon
which
I
ordered
Friday
to
rub
and
*NL*
bathe
his
ankles
with
rum
as
he
did
his
father
's
.
But
every
minute
he
*NL*
was
employed
in
this
he
would
cast
a
wishful
eye
towards
the
boat
,
where
*NL*
he
left
his
father
sitting
;
who
suddenly
disappearing
he
flew
like
*NL*
lightning
to
him
,
and
finding
he
had
only
laid
himself
down
to
ease
his
*NL*
limbs
,
he
returned
back
to
me
presently
;
and
then
I
spoke
to
the
*NL*
Spaniard
to
let
Friday
help
him
and
lead
him
to
the
boat
,
in
order
to
be
*NL*
conveyed
to
my
dwelling
where
I
would
take
care
of
him
.
Upon
which
*NL*
Friday
took
him
upon
his
back
and
so
carried
him
to
the
canoe
,
setting
*NL*
him
close
by
his
father
;
and
presently
stepping
out
again
,
launched
the
*NL*
boat
off
and
paddled
it
along
the
shore
faster
than
I
could
walk
,
though
*NL*
the
wind
blew
very
hard
too
,
and
having
brought
them
safe
to
the
creek
,
*NL*
away
he
runs
to
fetch
the
other
canoe
,
which
he
brought
to
the
creek
*NL*
almost
as
soon
as
I
got
to
it
by
land
,
when
wafting
me
over
,
he
took
our
*NL*
new
guests
out
of
the
boat
;
but
so
weak
were
they
that
I
was
forced
to
*NL*
make
a
kind
of
a
hand-barrow
;
and
when
I
came
to
my
castle
,
not
being
*NL*
willing
to
make
an
entrance
into
my
wall
,
we
made
them
a
handsome
tent
*NL*
covered
with
old
sails
and
boughs
of
trees
,
making
two
good
beds
of
rice
*NL*
straw
,
with
blankets
to
lie
upon
and
cover
them
.
Thus
like
an
absolute
*NL*
king
over
subjects
who
owed
their
lives
to
me
,
I
thought
myself
very
*NL*
considerable
,
especially
as
I
had
now
three
religions
in
my
kingdom
,
my
*NL*
man
Friday
being
a
Protestant
,
his
father
a
Pagan
,
and
the
Spaniard
a
*NL*
Papist
:
but
I
gave
liberty
of
conscience
to
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
provisions
for
my
poor
weak
subjects
,
I
ordered
Friday
to
kill
me
*NL*
a
yearling
goat
;
which
when
he
had
done
I
cut
off
the
hinder
quarters
,
*NL*
and
chopping
it
into
small
pieces
,
boiled
and
stewed
it
,
putting
barley
*NL*
and
rice
into
the
broth
.
This
I
carried
into
their
tent
,
set
a
table
,
*NL*
dined
with
them
myself
and
encouraged
them
.
Friday
was
my
interpreter
to
*NL*
his
father
,
and
indeed
to
the
Spaniard
too
,
who
spoke
the
language
of
*NL*
the
savages
pretty
well
.
After
dinner
I
ordered
Friday
to
fetch
home
all
*NL*
our
arms
from
the
field
of
battle
,
and
the
next
day
to
bury
the
dead
*NL*
bodies
,
which
he
did
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
made
Friday
inquire
of
his
father
,
whether
he
thought
these
*NL*
savages
had
escaped
the
late
storm
in
their
canoe
?
and
if
so
,
whether
*NL*
they
would
not
return
with
a
power
too
great
for
us
to
resist
?
He
*NL*
answered
,
_
that
he
thought
it
impossible
they
could
outlive
the
storm
;
*NL*
or
,
if
they
were
driven
southwardly
,
they
would
come
to
a
land
where
*NL*
they
would
as
certainly
be
devoured
,
as
if
they
were
drowned
in
the
sea
.
*NL*
And
suppose
they
had
attained
their
own
country
,
the
strangeness
of
*NL*
their
fatal
and
bloody
attack
,
would
make
them
tell
their
people
,
that
*NL*
the
rest
of
them
were
killed
by
thunder
and
lightning
,
not
by
the
hand
*NL*
of
man
,
but
by
two
heavenly
spirits
_
-LRB-
meaning
Friday
and
me
-RRB-
_
who
were
*NL*
sent
from
above
to
destroy
them
.
And
this
_
,
he
said
,
_
he
knew
because
he
*NL*
heard
them
say
the
same
to
one
another
_
.
And
indeed
he
was
in
the
right
*NL*
o
n't
;
for
I
have
heard
since
,
that
these
four
men
gave
out
that
whoever
*NL*
went
to
that
inchanted
island
,
would
be
destroyed
by
fire
from
the
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
canoes
appearing
soon
after
,
as
I
expected
,
my
apprehensions
ceased
:
*NL*
instead
of
which
my
former
thoughts
of
a
voyage
took
place
,
especially
*NL*
when
Friday
's
father
assured
me
,
I
should
have
good
usage
in
his
nation
.
*NL*
As
to
the
Spaniard
,
he
told
me
,
that
sixteen
more
of
his
countrymen
and
*NL*
Portuguese
,
who
had
been
shipwrecked
,
made
their
escape
thither
;
that
*NL*
though
they
were
in
union
with
the
savages
,
yet
they
were
very
miserable
*NL*
for
want
of
provisions
and
other
necessaries
.
When
I
asked
him
about
the
*NL*
particulars
of
his
voyage
,
he
answered
that
their
ship
was
bound
from
*NL*
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
to
the
Havannah
;
that
when
the
ship
was
lost
,
only
*NL*
five
men
perished
in
the
ocean
;
the
rest
having
saved
themselves
in
the
*NL*
boat
,
were
now
landed
on
the
main
continent
.
`
And
what
do
they
intend
to
*NL*
do
there
?
'
said
I
.
He
replied
,
they
have
concerted
measures
to
escape
,
*NL*
by
building
a
vessel
,
but
that
they
had
neither
tools
nor
provisions
,
*NL*
for
that
all
their
designs
came
to
nothing
.
`
Supposing
,
said
I
,
I
should
*NL*
make
a
proposal
,
and
invite
them
here
,
would
they
not
carry
me
prisoner
*NL*
to
New
Spain
?
'
he
answered
no
;
for
he
knew
them
to
be
such
honest
men
,
*NL*
as
would
scorn
to
act
such
inhuman
baseness
to
their
deliverer
:
That
,
if
*NL*
I
pleased
,
he
and
the
old
savage
would
go
over
to
them
,
talk
with
them
*NL*
about
it
,
and
bring
me
an
answer
:
That
they
should
all
swear
fidelity
to
*NL*
me
as
their
leader
,
upon
the
Holy
Sacrament
;
and
for
his
,
part
he
would
*NL*
not
only
do
the
same
,
but
stand
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
should
*NL*
there
be
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
solemn
assurances
made
me
resolve
to
grant
them
relief
,
and
to
*NL*
send
these
two
over
for
that
purpose
;
but
when
every
thing
was
ready
,
*NL*
the
Spaniard
raised
an
objection
,
which
carried
a
great
deal
of
weight
*NL*
in
it
:
_
You
know
,
Sir
,
said
he
,
that
having
been
some
time
with
you
,
I
*NL*
can
not
but
be
sensible
of
your
stock
of
rice
and
corn
,
sufficient
,
*NL*
perhaps
for
us
at
present
,
but
not
for
them
,
should
they
come
over
*NL*
presently
;
much
less
to
victual
a
vessel
for
an
intended
voyage
.
Want
*NL*
might
be
as
great
an
occasion
for
them
to
disagree
and
rebel
,
as
the
*NL*
children
of
Israel
did
against
God
himself
,
when
they
wanted
to
break
*NL*
bread
in
the
wilderness
.
And
therefore
,
my
advice
is
to
await
another
*NL*
harvest
and
in
the
mean
time
cultivate
and
improve
more
land
,
whereby
we
*NL*
may
have
plenty
of
provisions
in
order
to
execute
our
design
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
advice
of
the
Spaniard
's
I
approved
extremely
;
and
so
satisfied
was
*NL*
I
of
his
fidelity
that
I
esteemed
him
ever
after
.
And
thus
we
all
four
*NL*
went
to
work
upon
some
more
land
,
and
against
seed
time
we
had
gotten
so
*NL*
much
cured
and
trimmed
up
sufficient
to
sow
twenty-two
bushels
of
barley
*NL*
on
,
and
sixteen
jars
of
rice
,
which
was
in
short
all
the
feed
we
had
to
*NL*
spare
.
As
we
were
four
in
number
and
by
this
time
all
in
good
health
,
we
*NL*
feared
not
a
hundred
Indians
should
they
venture
to
attack
us
;
and
while
*NL*
the
corn
was
growing
,
I
pitched
upon
some
trees
,
fit
to
build
us
a
large
*NL*
vessel
in
case
the
Spaniards
came
over
;
which
being
marked
,
I
ordered
*NL*
Friday
and
his
father
to
cut
them
down
,
appointing
the
Spaniard
,
who
was
*NL*
now
my
privy
counsellor
,
to
oversee
and
direct
the
work
.
I
likewise
*NL*
increased
my
flocks
of
goats
by
shooting
the
wild
dams
and
bringing
home
*NL*
their
kids
to
my
inclosure
.
Nor
did
I
neglect
the
grape
season
,
but
*NL*
cured
them
as
usual
,
though
I
had
such
a
quantity
now
as
would
have
*NL*
filled
eighty
barrels
with
raisins
.
And
thus
all
of
us
being
employed
,
*NL*
they
in
working
,
and
I
in
providing
for
them
till
harvest
came
,
God
*NL*
Almighty
blessed
the
increase
of
it
so
much
,
that
from
twenty-two
*NL*
barrels
of
barley
we
thrashed
out
two
hundred
and
twenty
,
and
the
like
*NL*
quantity
of
rice
;
sufficient
to
victual
a
ship
fit
to
carry
me
and
all
*NL*
the
Spaniards
to
any
part
of
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
principal
objection
being
answered
,
by
a
sufficient
stock
of
*NL*
provisions
,
I
sent
my
two
ambassadors
over
to
the
main
land
,
with
a
*NL*
regal
authority
to
administer
the
oaths
of
allegiance
and
fidelity
,
and
*NL*
have
an
instrument
signed
under
their
hands
,
though
I
never
asked
*NL*
whether
they
had
pen
,
ink
,
or
paper
;
when
giving
each
of
them
a
musket
,
*NL*
eight
charges
of
powder
and
ball
,
and
provisions
enough
for
eight
days
,
*NL*
they
sailed
away
with
a
fair
gale
on
a
day
when
the
moon
was
at
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarce
a
fortnight
had
passed
over
my
head
,
but
impatient
for
their
*NL*
return
,
I
laid
me
down
to
sleep
one
morning
,
when
a
strange
accident
*NL*
happened
,
which
was
ushered
in
by
Friday
's
coming
running
to
me
,
and
*NL*
calling
aloud
,
_
Master
,
Master
,
they
are
come
,
they
are
come
.
_
Upon
*NL*
which
,
not
dreaming
of
any
danger
,
out
I
jumped
from
my
bed
,
put
on
my
*NL*
clothes
and
hurried
through
my
little
grove
;
when
looking
towards
the
*NL*
sea
,
I
perceived
a
boat
about
a
league
and
a
half
distant
,
standing
in
*NL*
for
the
shore
with
the
wind
fair
.
I
beheld
they
did
not
come
from
the
*NL*
side
where
the
land
lay
on
,
but
from
the
southerhmost
end
of
the
island
:
*NL*
So
these
being
none
of
the
people
we
wanted
,
I
ordered
Friday
to
lie
*NL*
still
,
till
such
time
as
I
came
down
from
the
mountain
,
which
,
with
my
*NL*
ladder
,
I
now
ascended
in
order
to
discover
more
fully
what
they
were
;
*NL*
and
now
,
with
the
help
of
my
perspective
glass
,
I
plainly
perceived
an
*NL*
English
ship
,
which
I
concluded
it
to
be
;
by
the
fashion
of
its
long
*NL*
boat
;
and
which
filled
me
with
such
uncommon
transports
of
joy
,
that
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
how
to
describe
;
and
yet
some
secret
doubts
hang
about
me
,
*NL*
proceeding
from
I
know
not
what
cause
,
as
though
I
had
reason
to
be
upon
*NL*
my
guard
.
And
,
indeed
,
I
would
have
no
man
contemn
the
secret
hints
and
*NL*
intimations
of
danger
,
which
very
often
are
given
,
when
he
may
imagine
*NL*
there
is
no
possibility
of
its
being
real
;
for
had
I
not
been
warned
by
*NL*
this
silent
admonition
,
I
had
been
in
a
worse
situation
than
before
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
inevitably
ruined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
it
was
,
before
I
perceived
the
boat
to
approach
the
shore
,
as
*NL*
though
they
looked
for
a
place
where
they
might
conveniently
land
;
and
*NL*
at
last
they
ran
their
boat
on
shore
upon
the
beach
,
about
half
a
mile
*NL*
distance
;
which
proved
so
much
the
happier
for
me
,
since
,
had
they
come
*NL*
into
the
creek
,
they
had
landed
just
at
my
door
,
and
might
not
only
have
*NL*
forced
me
out
of
my
castle
,
but
plundered
me
of
all
I
had
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Now
I
was
fully
convinced
they
were
all
Englishmen
,
three
of
which
were
*NL*
unarmed
and
bound
;
when
immediately
the
first
four
or
five
leaped
on
*NL*
shore
,
and
took
those
three
out
of
the
boat
as
prisoners
;
one
of
whom
I
*NL*
could
perceive
used
the
most
passionate
gestures
of
entreaty
,
*NL*
affliction
,
and
despair
,
while
the
others
in
a
lesser
degree
,
showed
*NL*
abundance
of
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
knowing
the
meaning
of
this
,
I
was
very
much
astonished
,
and
I
*NL*
beckoned
to
Friday
,
who
was
below
,
to
ascend
the
mountain
,
and
likewise
*NL*
view
this
sight
.
_
O
master
_
,
said
he
to
me
,
_
you
see
English
mans
eat
*NL*
prisoners
as
well
as
Savage
mans
_
.
`
And
do
you
think
they
will
eat
them
*NL*
Friday
?
'
said
I.
_
Yes
_
,
said
Friday
,
_
they
eat
all
up
_
.
`
No
,
no
,
'
said
*NL*
I
,
`
Friday
,
I
am
much
more
concerned
lest
they
murder
them
,
but
as
for
*NL*
eating
them
up
,
that
I
am
sure
they
will
never
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
not
only
lamented
my
misfortune
in
not
having
the
Spaniard
and
*NL*
Savage
with
me
,
but
also
that
I
could
not
come
within
shot
of
them
*NL*
unperceived
,
they
having
no
fire
arms
among
them
,
and
save
these
three
*NL*
me
,
whom
I
thought
they
were
going
to
kill
with
their
swords
.
But
some
*NL*
comfort
it
was
to
me
,
that
I
perceived
they
were
set
at
liberty
to
go
*NL*
where
they
pleased
,
the
rascally
seamen
scattering
about
as
though
they
*NL*
had
a
mind
to
see
the
place
;
and
so
long
did
they
negligently
ramble
,
*NL*
that
the
tide
had
ebbed
so
low
,
as
to
leave
the
boat
aground
.
Nor
were
*NL*
the
two
men
who
were
in
her
more
circumspect
;
for
having
drunk
a
little
*NL*
too
much
liquor
,
they
fell
fast
asleep
;
but
one
of
them
waking
before
*NL*
the
other
,
and
perceiving
the
boat
too
fast
aground
for
his
strength
to
*NL*
move
it
,
he
hallooed
out
to
the
rest
,
who
made
all
possible
expedition
*NL*
to
come
to
him
;
but
as
Providence
ordered
it
,
all
their
force
was
*NL*
ineffectual
to
launch
her
,
when
I
could
hear
them
speak
to
one
another
,
*NL*
_
Why
let
her
alone
,
Jack
,
ca
n't
ye
,
she
'll
float
next
tide
_
;
by
which
*NL*
words
I
was
fully
convinced
they
were
my
own
countrymen
.
I
all
this
*NL*
while
lay
very
quiet
,
as
being
fully
sensible
it
could
be
no
less
than
*NL*
ten
hours
before
the
boat
would
be
afloat
,
and
then
it
would
be
so
dark
,
*NL*
that
they
could
not
easily
perceive
me
,
by
which
means
I
should
be
at
*NL*
more
liberty
to
hear
their
talk
,
and
observe
all
their
motions
:
not
but
*NL*
that
I
prepared
for
my
defence
:
yet
,
as
I
had
another
sort
of
enemy
to
*NL*
combat
with
I
acted
with
more
caution
.
I
took
two
fusees
on
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
gave
Friday
three
muskets
;
besides
my
formidable
goat-skin
coat
and
*NL*
monstrous
cap
made
me
look
as
fierce
and
terrible
as
Hercules
of
old
,
*NL*
especially
when
two
pistols
were
stuck
in
my
belt
,
and
my
naked
sword
*NL*
hanging
by
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
design
at
first
not
to
make
any
attempt
till
it
was
dark
;
and
*NL*
it
being
now
two
o'clock
,
in
the
very
heat
of
the
day
,
the
sailors
were
*NL*
all
straggling
in
the
woods
,
and
undoubtedly
were
lain
down
to
sleep
.
*NL*
The
three
poor
distressed
creatures
,
too
anxious
to
get
any
repose
,
were
*NL*
however
seated
under
the
shade
of
a
great
tree
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
from
me
.
Upon
which
,
without
any
more
ado
,
I
approached
towards
*NL*
them
,
with
my
man
following
behind
me
,
and
before
I
was
perceived
,
I
*NL*
called
aloud
to
them
in
Spanish
,
_
What
are
ye
,
Gentlemen
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
they
started
up
in
great
confusion
,
when
they
beheld
the
*NL*
strange
figure
I
made
;
they
returned
no
answer
,
but
seemed
as
if
they
*NL*
would
fly
from
me
:
`
Gentlemen
,
'
said
I
,
in
English
`
do
n't
be
afraid
,
*NL*
perhaps
you
have
a
friend
nearer
than
you
expect
.
'
_
He
must
be
from
*NL*
Heaven
_
,
said
one
of
them
,
gravely
pulling
off
his
hat
,
_
for
we
are
past
*NL*
all
help
in
this
world
.
_
`
All
help
is
from
Heaven
,
'
said
I
:
`
But
Sir
,
as
*NL*
I
have
perceived
every
action
between
you
and
these
brutes
since
your
*NL*
landing
only
inform
me
,
how
to
assist
you
,
and
I
will
do
it
to
the
*NL*
utmost
of
my
power
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
_
Am
I
talking
with
God
or
man
_
,
said
he
,
in
melting
tears
.
_
Are
you
of
*NL*
human
kind
or
an
angel
_
?
`
Sir
,
'
said
I
,
`
my
poor
habit
will
tell
you
I
*NL*
am
a
man
,
and
an
Englishman
,
willing
to
assist
you
,
having
but
this
*NL*
servant
only
:
here
are
arms
and
ammunition
:
tell
freely
your
condition
:
*NL*
Can
we
save
you
?
'
_
The
story
_
,
said
he
,
_
is
too
long
to
relate
,
since
*NL*
our
butchers
are
so
near
:
but
,
Sir
,
I
was
master
of
that
ship
,
my
men
*NL*
have
mutinied
,
and
it
is
a
favour
they
have
put
my
mate
,
this
*NL*
passenger
,
and
me
,
on
shore
without
murdering
us
,
though
we
expect
*NL*
nothing
but
perishing
here
_
.
`
Are
your
enemies
gone
?
'
said
I.
_
No
_
,
*NL*
replied
he
,
pointing
to
a
thicket
,
_
there
they
lie
,
while
my
heart
*NL*
trembles
,
lest
having
seen
and
heard
us
they
should
murder
us
all
.
_
*NL*
`
Have
they
fire
arms
?
'
said
I.
_
They
have
but
two
pieces
_
,
said
he
,
_
one
*NL*
of
which
is
left
in
the
boat
.
_
He
also
told
me
there
were
two
enormous
*NL*
villains
among
them
,
that
were
the
authors
of
this
mutiny
,
who
,
if
they
*NL*
were
killed
or
seized
,
might
induce
the
rest
to
return
to
their
*NL*
obedience
.
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
I
,
`
let
us
retire
farther
under
the
*NL*
covering
of
the
woods
;
'
and
there
it
was
I
made
these
conditions
*NL*
with
him
:

accosting
the
Captain
,
&
c.
set
ashore
by
the
*NL*
Mutineers
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
I.
That
,
while
they
staid
in
the
island
,
they
should
not
pretend
to
any
*NL*
authority
;
but
should
entirely
conform
to
my
orders
,
and
return
me
the
*NL*
arms
which
I
should
put
in
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
.
That
,
if
the
ship
was
recovered
,
they
should
afford
Friday
and
*NL*
myself
a
passage
_
gratis
_
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
given
me
all
the
satisfaction
I
could
desire
,
I
gave
him
and
*NL*
his
two
companions
each
of
them
a
gun
,
with
powder
and
ball
sufficient
,
*NL*
advising
them
to
fire
upon
them
as
they
lay
sleeping
.
The
Captain
*NL*
modestly
said
,
that
he
was
sorry
to
kill
them
;
though
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
to
let
these
villains
escape
,
who
were
the
authors
of
his
misery
,
*NL*
might
be
the
ruin
of
us
all
.
_
Well
,
_
said
he
,
_
do
as
you
think
fit
;
_
and
*NL*
so
accordingly
I
fired
,
killed
one
of
the
Captain
's
chief
enemies
and
*NL*
wounding
the
other
;
who
eagerly
called
for
assistance
,
but
the
Captain
*NL*
who
had
reserved
his
piece
,
coming
up
to
him
,
_
Sirrah
_
,
said
he
,
_
't
is
*NL*
too
late
to
call
for
assistance
,
you
should
rather
cry
to
God
to
pardon
*NL*
your
villany
;
_
and
so
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
of
his
gun
:
three
*NL*
others
were
also
slightly
wounded
,
who
at
my
approach
cried
out
for
*NL*
mercy
.
This
the
Captain
granted
upon
condition
that
they
would
swear
to
*NL*
be
true
to
him
in
recovering
the
ship
,
which
they
solemnly
did
;
However
*NL*
I
obliged
the
Captain
to
keep
them
bound
.
After
which
I
sent
Friday
and
*NL*
the
Captain
's
mate
to
secure
the
boat
and
bring
away
the
oars
and
sails
;
*NL*
when
,
at
their
return
,
three
men
coming
back
,
and
seeing
their
late
*NL*
distressed
Captain
,
now
their
conqueror
,
submitted
to
be
bound
also
.
And
*NL*
then
it
was
,
that
having
more
liberty
,
I
related
the
adventures
of
my
*NL*
whole
life
,
which
he
heard
with
a
serious
and
wonderful
attention
.
After
*NL*
this
,
I
carried
him
and
his
two
companions
into
my
little
fortified
*NL*
castle
,
shewed
them
all
my
conveniences
,
and
refreshed
them
with
such
*NL*
provisions
as
I
could
afford
.
When
this
was
over
,
we
began
to
consider
*NL*
about
regaining
the
ship
:
he
said
,
that
there
were
twenty-six
hands
on
*NL*
board
,
who
knowing
their
lives
were
forfeited
by
the
law
,
for
conspiracy
*NL*
and
mutiny
,
were
so
very
hardened
,
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
our
*NL*
small
company
to
attack
them
.
This
was
a
reasonable
inference
indeed
;
*NL*
but
something
we
must
resolve
on
,
and
immediately
,
put
in
execution
:
*NL*
we
,
therefore
heaved
the
boat
upon
the
beach
so
high
that
she
could
not
*NL*
shoot
off
at
high
water
mark
,
and
broke
a
hole
in
her
not
easily
to
be
*NL*
stopped
;
so
that
all
the
signals
they
gave
for
the
boat
to
come
on
board
*NL*
were
in
vain
.
This
obliged
them
to
send
another
boat
ashore
,
with
ten
*NL*
men
armed
,
whose
faces
the
Captain
plainly
descried
,
the
boatswain
being
*NL*
the
chief
officer
;
but
he
said
there
were
three
honest
lads
among
them
,
*NL*
who
were
forced
into
the
conspiracy
.
Hereupon
I
gave
him
fresh
courage
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
had
perceived
he
was
in
concern
-RRB-
:
In
the
mean
while
securing
our
*NL*
prisoners
,
except
two
,
whom
we
took
to
our
assistance
,
we
thought
*NL*
ourselves
able
enough
to
adventure
a
battle
.
When
the
sailors
landed
,
*NL*
and
beheld
their
boat
in
that
condition
,
they
not
only
hallooed
,
but
*NL*
fired
for
their
companions
to
hear
,
yet
they
received
no
answer
.
This
*NL*
struck
them
with
horror
and
amazement
,
thinking
their
companions
were
*NL*
murdered
,
they
made
as
if
they
would
return
to
the
ship
.
I
could
*NL*
perceive
the
Captain
's
countenance
change
at
this
,
till
of
a
sudden
*NL*
three
men
were
ordered
to
look
after
the
boat
,
while
the
other
seven
*NL*
leapt
on
shore
in
order
to
search
for
their
companions
;
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
they
came
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
near
my
ancient
castle
,
from
whence
*NL*
they
could
see
to
a
great
distance
in
the
woods
,
and
there
shooting
and
*NL*
hallooing
till
tired
and
weary
,
they
at
length
seated
themselves
under
a
*NL*
spreading
tree
.
My
opinion
was
,
that
nothing
could
be
done
till
night
,
*NL*
when
I
might
use
some
artifice
to
get
them
all
out
of
the
boat
;
but
of
a
*NL*
sudden
they
started
up
,
and
made
to
the
sea-side
;
hereupon
I
ordered
*NL*
Friday
and
the
Captain
's
mate
to
go
over
the
creek
,
and
halloo
as
loud
*NL*
as
they
could
,
and
so
decoying
them
into
the
woods
,
come
round
to
me
*NL*
again
.
And
this
,
indeed
,
had
good
effect
;
for
they
followed
the
noise
,
*NL*
till
coming
westward
to
the
creek
,
they
called
for
their
boat
to
carry
*NL*
them
over
,
and
taking
one
of
the
men
out
of
her
,
left
two
to
look
after
*NL*
her
,
having
fastened
her
to
the
stump
of
a
little
tree
on
shore
.
*NL*
Hereupon
immediately
the
Captain
and
our
party
passing
the
creek
,
out
of
*NL*
their
sight
,
we
surprised
them
both
,
by
the
Captain
's
knocking
down
one
,
*NL*
and
ordering
the
other
in
surrender
upon
pain
of
death
,
and
who
being
*NL*
the
honestest
of
them
all
,
sincerely
joined
with
us
.
By
this
time
it
was
*NL*
pretty
late
;
when
the
rest
returning
to
there
boat
,
which
they
found
*NL*
aground
in
the
creek
,
the
tide
out
,
and
the
men
gone
,
they
ran
about
*NL*
wringing
their
hands
,
crying
it
was
an
enchanted
island
,
and
that
they
*NL*
should
be
all
murdered
by
spirits
or
devils
.
My
men
would
willingly
have
*NL*
fallen
upon
them
,
but
I
would
not
agree
to
hazard
any
of
our
party
.
But
*NL*
to
be
more
certain
,
Friday
&
the
Captain
crawled
upon
their
hands
&
*NL*
feet
,
as
near
as
possible
;
and
when
the
boatswain
approached
in
sight
,
*NL*
so
eager
was
the
Captain
,
that
he
fired
and
killed
him
on
the
spot
;
*NL*
Friday
wounded
the
next
man
,
and
a
third
ran
away
.
Hereupon
I
advanced
*NL*
with
,
my
whole
army
:
and
,
it
being
dark
,
I
ordered
the
man
we
had
*NL*
surprised
in
the
boat
,
to
call
them
by
their
names
,
and
to
parley
with
*NL*
them
.
Accordingly
he
called
out
aloud
,
_
Tom
Smith
,
Tom
Smith
!
_
He
*NL*
answered
,
_
Who
's
that
?
Robinson
!
_
answered
the
other
.
_
For
God
's
sake
*NL*
Tom
,
surrender
immediately
,
or
you
're
all
dead
men
.
Who
must
we
*NL*
surrender
to
?
_
says
Smith
.
_
To
our
captain
and
fifty
men
here
,
who
have
*NL*
taken
me
prisoner
,
wounded
Will
Frye
,
and
killed
the
boatswain
.
Shall
we
*NL*
have
quarter
then
?
_
said
he
.
Hereupon
the
Captain
calls
out
,
_
You
Smith
,
*NL*
you
know
my
voice
,
surrender
immediately
,
and
you
shall
all
have
your
*NL*
lives
granted
,
except
Will
Atkins
_
.
Hereupon
Atkins
cries
out
,
_
What
*NL*
have
I
done
Captain
,
more
than
the
rest
,
who
have
been
as
bad
as
me
?
_
*NL*
But
that
was
a
lie
,
for
he
was
the
person
that
laid
hold
of
him
,
and
*NL*
bound
him
.
However
,
he
was
ordered
to
submit
to
the
governor
's
mercy
,
*NL*
for
such
was
I
called
.
And
so
,
laying
down
their
arms
,
we
bound
them
*NL*
all
,
and
seized
on
their
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
the
Captain
expostulated
with
them
,
telling
them
that
the
*NL*
governor
was
an
Englishman
,
who
might
execute
them
there
;
but
he
thought
*NL*
they
would
be
sent
to
England
,
except
Will
Atkins
,
who
was
ordered
to
*NL*
prepare
for
death
next
morning
.
Hereupon
Atkins
implored
the
Captain
to
*NL*
intercede
for
his
life
,
and
the
rest
begged
they
might
not
be
sent
to
*NL*
England
.
This
answered
our
project
for
seizing
the
ship
.
For
after
*NL*
sending
Atkins
and
two
of
the
worst
fast
bound
to
the
cave
,
and
the
rest
*NL*
being
committed
to
my
bower
,
I
sent
the
Captain
to
treat
with
them
in
*NL*
the
,
governor
's
name
,
offering
them
pardon
if
they
would
assist
in
*NL*
recovering
the
ship
.
Upon
which
they
all
promised
to
stand
by
him
till
*NL*
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
;
and
whoever
acted
treacherously
,
should
be
*NL*
hanged
in
chains
upon
the
beach
.
They
were
all
released
on
these
*NL*
assurances
:
and
then
the
Captain
repaired
to
the
other
boat
,
making
his
*NL*
passenger
Captain
of
her
,
and
gave
him
four
men
well
armed
;
while
*NL*
himself
,
his
mate
,
and
five
more
,
went
in
the
other
boat
.
By
midnight
*NL*
they
came
within
call
of
the
ship
,
when
the
Captain
ordered
Robinson
to
*NL*
hale
her
,
and
tell
them
that
with
great
difficulty
they
had
found
the
*NL*
men
at
last
.
But
while
they
were
discoursing
,
the
Captain
,
his
mate
and
*NL*
the
rest
entered
,
and
knocked
down
the
second
mate
and
carpenter
,
*NL*
secured
those
that
were
upon
the
deck
,
by
putting
them
under
hatches
,
*NL*
while
the
other
boat
's
crew
entered
and
secured
the
forecastle
;
they
*NL*
then
broke
into
the
round-house
,
where
the
mate
after
some
resistance
,
*NL*
shot
the
pirate
captain
through
the
head
,
upon
which
all
the
rest
*NL*
yielded
themselves
prisoners
.
And
thus
the
ship
being
recovered
,
the
*NL*
joyful
signal
was
fired
,
which
I
heard
with
the
greatest
joy
imaginable
:
*NL*
nor
was
it
long
before
he
brought
the
ship
to
an
anchor
at
the
creek
's
*NL*
mouth
,
where
,
coming
to
me
unawares
,
_
There
_
,
says
he
_
my
dearest
friend
*NL*
and
deliverer
,
there
is
your
ship
,
and
we
are
your
servants
_
:
a
comfort
*NL*
so
unspeakable
,
as
made
me
swoon
in
his
arms
while
,
with
gratitude
to
*NL*
Heaven
,
we
were
tenderly
embracing
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
now
remaining
,
but
to
consult
what
we
should
do
with
the
*NL*
prisoners
,
whom
he
thought
it
was
not
safe
to
take
on
board
.
Hereupon
*NL*
concerting
with
the
Captain
,
I
dressed
myself
in
one
of
his
suits
,
and
*NL*
sending
for
them
,
told
them
,
that
I
was
going
to
leave
the
island
with
*NL*
all
my
people
,
if
they
would
tarry
there
,
their
lives
should
be
spared
;
*NL*
if
not
,
they
should
be
hanged
at
the
first
port
they
came
at
.
They
*NL*
agreed
to
stay
.
Hereupon
I
told
them
my
whole
story
,
charging
them
to
be
*NL*
kind
to
the
Spaniards
that
were
expected
,
gave
them
,
all
my
arms
,
and
*NL*
informing
them
of
every
thing
necessary
for
their
subsistence
,
I
and
my
*NL*
man
Friday
went
on
board
.
But
the
next
morning
two
of
the
men
came
*NL*
swimming
to
the
ship
's
side
,
desiring
the
Captain
to
take
them
on
board
,
*NL*
though
he
hanged
them
afterwards
,
complaining
mightily
how
barbarously
*NL*
the
others
used
them
.
Upon
which
I
prevailed
with
the
Captain
to
take
*NL*
them
in
;
and
being
severely
whipt
and
pickled
,
they
proved
more
honest
*NL*
for
the
future
,
and
so
I
bid
farewell
to
this
island
,
carrying
along
*NL*
with
me
my
money
,
my
parrot
,
umbrella
,
and
goat-skin
cap
;
setting
sail
*NL*
December
12
,
1686
,
after
twenty-eight
years
,
two
months
,
and
nineteen
*NL*
days
residence
,
that
same
day
and
month
that
I
escaped
from
Sallee
;
*NL*
landing
in
England
,
June
11
,
1687
,
after
five
and
thirty
years
absence
*NL*
from
my
own
country
;
which
rendered
me
altogether
a
stranger
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
found
my
first
Captain
's
widow
alive
,
who
had
buried
a
second
*NL*
husband
,
but
in
very
mean
circumstances
,
and
whom
I
made
easy
upon
his
*NL*
account
.
Soon
after
I
went
down
to
Yorkshire
,
where
all
my
family
were
*NL*
expired
,
except
two
sisters
,
and
as
many
of
one
of
my
brother
's
*NL*
children
.
I
found
no
provision
had
been
made
for
me
,
they
concluding
I
*NL*
had
been
long
since
dead
;
so
that
I
was
but
in
a
very
slender
station
.
*NL*
Indeed
the
Captain
did
me
a
great
kindness
,
by
his
report
to
the
owners
,
*NL*
how
I
had
delivered
their
ship
on
the
Desolate
Island
,
upon
which
they
*NL*
made
me
a
present
of
200L
.
sterling
.
I
next
went
to
Lisbon
,
taking
my
*NL*
man
Friday
with
me
,
and
there
arriving
in
April
,
I
met
the
Portuguese
*NL*
Captain
who
had
taken
me
on
board
on
the
African
coast
;
but
,
being
*NL*
ancient
,
he
had
left
off
the
sea
,
and
resigned
all
his
business
to
his
*NL*
son
,
who
followed
the
Brazil
trade
.
So
altered
both
of
us
were
,
that
we
*NL*
did
not
know
each
other
at
first
,
till
I
discovered
myself
more
fully
to
*NL*
him
.
After
a
few
embraces
,
I
began
to
enquire
of
my
concerns
;
and
then
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
told
me
that
it
was
nine
years
since
he
had
been
at
*NL*
Brazil
,
where
my
partner
was
then
living
,
but
my
trustees
were
both
*NL*
dead
;
that
he
believed
I
should
have
a
good
account
of
the
product
of
my
*NL*
plantation
;
that
the
imagination
of
my
being
lost
,
had
obliged
my
*NL*
trustees
to
give
an
estimate
of
my
share
to
the
procurator
fiscal
,
who
,
*NL*
in
case
of
my
not
returning
,
had
given
one
third
to
the
king
&
the
rest
*NL*
to
the
monastery
of
St.
Augustine
:
but
if
I
put
in
my
claim
,
or
any
one
*NL*
for
me
,
it
would
be
returned
,
except
the
yearly
product
which
was
given
*NL*
to
the
poor
.
I
then
desired
him
to
tell
me
what
improvement
he
thought
*NL*
had
been
made
of
my
plantation
,
and
whether
he
imagined
it
was
worth
my
*NL*
while
to
look
after
it
?
he
answered
,
he
did
not
know
how
much
it
was
*NL*
improved
;
but
this
he
was
certain
of
,
that
my
partner
was
grown
vastly
*NL*
rich
upon
his
half
of
it
;
and
,
that
he
had
been
informed
,
that
the
kind
*NL*
had
200
moidores
per
annum
of
his
third
part
.
He
added
,
that
the
*NL*
survivors
of
my
trustees
were
nervous
of
an
ingenuous
character
;
that
my
*NL*
partner
could
witness
my
title
,
my
name
being
registered
in
the
country
,
*NL*
by
which
means
I
should
indefensibly
recover
considerable
sums
of
money
,
*NL*
but
,
answered
,
I
,
how
could
my
trustees
dispose
of
my
effects
,
when
I
*NL*
made
you
only
my
heir
?
This
,
said
he
,
was
true
but
,
there
being
no
*NL*
affidavit
made
of
my
death
he
could
not
act
as
my
executor
.
However
,
he
*NL*
had
ordered
his
don
,
-LRB-
then
at
Brazil
-RRB-
,
to
act
by
procuration
upon
my
*NL*
account
,
and
he
had
taken
possession
of
my
sugar-house
,
having
accounted
*NL*
himself
for
eight
years
with
my
partner
and
trustees
for
the
profits
,
of
*NL*
which
he
would
give
me
a
very
good
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
this
he
performed
very
faithfully
in
a
few
days
,
making
*NL*
himself
indebted
to
me
470
moidores
of
gold
,
over
and
above
what
had
*NL*
been
lost
at
sea
,
after
I
had
left
the
place
.
And
then
he
recounted
to
*NL*
me
what
misfortune
he
had
gone
through
,
which
forced
my
money
out
of
his
*NL*
hands
,
to
buy
part
in
a
new
ship-but
says
he
,
_
you
shall
not
want
,
take
*NL*
this
;
and
,
when
my
son
returns
,
every
farthing
shall
be
paid
you
.
_
Upon
*NL*
which
he
put
into
my
hand
a
purse
of
150
moidores
in
gold
,
as
likewise
*NL*
the
instrument
,
containing
the
title
to
the
ship
which
his
son
was
in
,
*NL*
and
which
he
offered
as
security
for
the
remainder
.
But
really
when
I
*NL*
saw
so
much
goodness
,
generosity
,
tenderness
,
and
real
honesty
,
I
had
*NL*
not
the
heart
to
accept
it
,
for
fear
he
should
straiten
himself
upon
my
*NL*
account
.
_
It
is
true
,
_
said
he
,
_
it
may
be
so
;
but
then
the
money
is
*NL*
yours
,
not
mine
,
and
you
may
have
the
greatest
occasion
for
it
.
_
*NL*
However
,
I
returned
fifty
of
them
back
again
,
promising
that
I
would
*NL*
freely
forgive
him
the
other
hundred
when
I
got
my
effects
into
my
*NL*
hands
,
and
that
I
designed
to
go
myself
for
that
purpose
.
But
he
told
me
*NL*
he
could
save
me
that
trouble
,
and
so
caused
me
to
enter
my
name
with
a
*NL*
public
notary
,
as
likewise
my
affidavit
,
with
a
procuration
affixed
to
*NL*
it
;
and
this
he
ordered
me
to
send
in
a
letter
to
one
of
his
*NL*
acquaintance
,
a
merchant
in
Brazil
;
and
,
indeed
,
nothing
could
be
more
*NL*
faithfully
and
honourably
observed
;
for
,
in
seven
months
time
,
I
had
a
*NL*
very
faithful
account
of
all
my
effects
,
what
sums
of
money
were
raised
,
*NL*
what
expended
,
and
what
remained
for
myself
!
In
a
word
I
found
myself
*NL*
to
be
worth
5000L
.
sterling
,
and
1000
per
annum
.
Nor
was
this
all
,
for
*NL*
my
partner
congratulated
me
upon
my
being
alive
,
telling
me
how
much
my
*NL*
plantation
was
improved
;
what
Negroes
were
at
work
,
and
how
many
_
Ave
*NL*
Marias
_
he
had
said
to
the
Virgin
Mary
for
my
preservation
,
desiring
me
*NL*
to
accept
kindly
some
presents
he
had
sent
me
,
which
I
found
showed
the
*NL*
greatest
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
the
ship
arrive
,
but
I
rewarded
my
faithful
Captain
,
by
*NL*
returning
him
the
hundred
moidores
,
and
not
only
forgiving
him
all
he
*NL*
owed
me
,
I
allowed
him
yearly
a
hundred
more
,
and
fifty
to
his
son
,
*NL*
during
their
lives
.
And
now
being
resolved
to
go
to
England
,
I
returned
*NL*
letters
of
thanks
to
the
Prior
of
St.
Augustine
,
and
in
particular
to
my
*NL*
old
partner
,
with
very
suitable
presents
.
By
the
Captain
's
advice
,
I
was
*NL*
persuaded
to
go
by
land
to
Calais
,
and
there
take
passage
for
England
:
*NL*
when
,
as
it
happened
,
I
got
a
young
English
gentleman
,
a
merchant
's
son
*NL*
at
Lisbon
,
to
accompany
me
,
together
with
two
English
,
and
two
*NL*
Portuguese
gentleman
:
so
that
with
a
Portuguese
servant
,
an
English
*NL*
sailor
,
and
my
man
Friday
,
there
were
nine
of
us
in
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
armed
and
equipped
,
we
set
out
,
and
came
to
Madrid
,
when
the
summer
*NL*
decaying
,
we
hasted
to
Navarre
,
where
we
were
informed
that
there
was
*NL*
scarcely
any
passing
,
be
reason
of
the
prodigious
quantity
of
snow
;
so
*NL*
that
we
were
obliged
to
abide
near
twenty
days
at
Pamoeluria
,
and
at
*NL*
last
to
take
a
guide
to
conduct
us
safe
towards
Tholouse
.
And
now
twelve
*NL*
other
gentlemen
joining
with
us
,
together
with
their
servants
,
we
had
a
*NL*
very
jolly
company
.
Away
our
guide
led
us
by
frightful
mountains
,
and
*NL*
through
so
many
intricate
mazes
and
windings
,
that
we
insensibly
passed
*NL*
them
,
which
,
as
we
travelled
along
,
ushered
us
into
the
prospect
of
the
*NL*
fruitful
and
charming
provinces
of
Languedoc
and
Galcoigne
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
came
on
two
adventures
,
both
tragical
and
comical
.
First
,
our
*NL*
guide
was
encountered
by
three
wolves
and
a
bear
,
who
set
upon
him
and
*NL*
his
horse
,
and
wounded
him
in
three
places
;
upon
which
my
man
,
riding
up
*NL*
to
his
assistance
,
shot
one
of
them
dead
upon
the
spot
,
which
made
the
*NL*
others
retire
into
the
woods
.
But
the
pleasantest
adventure
was
,
to
*NL*
behold
my
man
attack
the
bear
.
'T
is
such
a
creature
,
that
if
you
let
him
*NL*
alone
,
he
will
never
meddle
with
you
,
and
this
my
man
very
well
knew
,
*NL*
and
so
begging
leave
of
me
in
broken
English
,
he
told
us
,
_
he
would
make
*NL*
good
laugh
_
.
`
Why
,
you
silly
fool
,
'
said
I
,
`
he
'll
eat
you
up
at
a
*NL*
mouthful
.
'
_
Eatee
me
up
,
_
replied
he
,
by
way
of
scorn
,
_
me
not
only
*NL*
eatee
him
,
but
make
much
good
laugh
.
_
Upon
which
,
pulling
off
his
boots
,
*NL*
he
claps
on
his
pumps
,
and
running
after
the
monstrous
beast
,
he
called
*NL*
out
,
that
he
wanted
to
discourse
with
him
,
and
then
throwing
stones
on
*NL*
purpose
to
incense
him
,
the
beast
turns
about
in
fury
,
and
,
with
*NL*
prodigious
strides
,
shuffles
after
him
.
But
though
he
was
not
swift
*NL*
enough
to
keep
up
pace
with
Friday
,
who
made
up
to
us
as
it
were
for
*NL*
help
;
yet
being
angry
,
`
You
dog
,
'
said
I
,
`
immediately
take
horse
,
and
*NL*
let
us
shoot
the
creature
.
'
But
he
cried
,
_
Dear
master
,
no
shoot
,
me
*NL*
make
you
laugh
much
.
_
And
so
he
turned
about
,
making
signs
to
follow
,
*NL*
while
the
bear
ran
after
,
till
coming
to
a
great
oak
,
he
ascended
in
a
*NL*
minute
,
leaving
his
gun
,
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
Nor
did
the
bear
make
any
*NL*
difficulty
of
it
,
but
ascended
like
a
cat
,
though
his
weight
was
very
*NL*
great
.
You
must
consider
I
was
not
a
little
amazed
at
the
folly
of
my
*NL*
man
,
as
not
perceiving
any
thing
to
occasion
our
laughter
,
till
such
*NL*
time
as
we
rode
up
nearer
,
and
beheld
the
bear
mounted
upon
the
oak
,
on
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
same
branch
,
to
which
Friday
clung
at
the
farther
*NL*
end
,
where
the
bear
durst
not
come
.
Hereupon
Friday
cried
out
,
_
Now
*NL*
master
,
me
make
much
laugh
,
me
make
bear
dance
.
_
Upon
which
he
fell
a
*NL*
shaking
the
bough
,
which
made
the
creature
look
behind
him
,
to
see
how
*NL*
he
could
retreat
.
Then
as
if
the
bear
had
understood
his
stammering
*NL*
English
,
_
Why
you
no
come
farther
,
Mr.
Bear
_
said
he
,
_
pray
,
Mr.
Bear
*NL*
come
farther
_
;
and
then
indeed
we
all
burst
into
a
laughter
;
especially
*NL*
when
we
perceived
Friday
drop
like
a
squirrel
upon
the
ground
,
leaving
*NL*
the
beast
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
down
the
tree
.
And
now
thinking
it
*NL*
the
most
convenient
time
to
shoot
the
creature
,
Friday
cried
out
,
_
O
*NL*
dear
master
,
no
shoot
,
me
shoot
by
and
by
_
;
when
taking
up
the
gun
,
_
me
*NL*
no
shoot
yet
_
,
said
he
_
me
make
one
more
much
laugh
.
_
And
accordingly
he
*NL*
was
as
good
as
his
word
;
for
the
creature
descending
backwards
from
the
*NL*
tree
very
leisurely
,
before
he
could
lay
one
foot
on
the
ground
,
Friday
*NL*
shot
him
through
the
ear
,
stone
dead
;
and
looking
to
see
whether
we
were
*NL*
pleased
,
he
burst
out
into
a
hearty
laughter
,
saying
,
_
So
we
kill
de
*NL*
bear
in
my
country
,
not
with
the
gun
,
but
with
much
long
arrows
.
_
Thus
*NL*
ended
our
diversion
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
;
especially
in
a
place
*NL*
where
the
terrible
howlings
struck
us
with
a
continual
terror
.
But
the
*NL*
snows
now
growing
very
deep
,
particularly
on
the
mountains
,
the
ravenous
*NL*
creatures
were
then
obliged
to
seek
for
sustenance
in
the
villages
,
were
*NL*
coming
by
surprise
on
the
country
people
,
killed
several
of
them
,
*NL*
besides
a
great
number
of
their
sheep
and
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
guide
told
us
,
we
had
yet
one
more
dangerous
place
to
pass
by
;
and
*NL*
if
their
were
any
more
wolves
in
the
country
,
there
we
should
find
them
.
*NL*
This
was
a
small
plain
encompassed
with
woods
,
to
get
through
a
long
*NL*
lane
to
the
village
where
we
were
to
lodge
.
When
we
entered
the
wood
,
*NL*
the
sun
was
within
half
an
hour
of
setting
:
and
a
little
after
it
was
*NL*
set
,
we
came
into
the
plain
,
which
was
not
above
two
furlongs
over
,
and
*NL*
then
we
perceived
five
great
wolves
cross
the
road
,
without
taking
*NL*
notice
of
us
,
and
so
swift
as
though
they
were
pursuing
after
their
*NL*
prey
.
Hereupon
our
guide
,
believing
there
were
more
coming
,
desired
us
*NL*
to
be
on
our
guard
.
Accordingly
our
eyes
were
very
circumspect
,
till
*NL*
about
half
a
league
farther
,
we
perceived
a
dead
horse
,
and
near
a
dozen
*NL*
of
wolves
devouring
its
carcase
.
My
man
Friday
fain
would
have
fired
at
*NL*
them
,
but
I
would
not
permit
him
;
nor
had
we
gone
half
over
the
plain
,
*NL*
but
we
heard
dreadful
howlings
in
a
wood
on
our
left
,
when
presently
we
*NL*
saw
an
hundred
come
up
against
us
,
as
though
they
had
been
an
*NL*
experienced
army
.
This
obliged
us
to
form
ourselves
in
the
best
manner
;
*NL*
and
then
I
ordered
that
every
other
man
should
fire
,
that
those
who
did
*NL*
not
,
might
be
ready
to
gave
a
second
volley
,
should
they
advance
upon
*NL*
us
;
and
then
every
man
should
make
use
of
his
pistols
.
But
there
was
no
*NL*
necessity
for
this
;
for
the
enemy
being
terrified
stopped
at
the
noise
*NL*
of
the
fire
;
four
of
them
were
shot
dead
,
and
,
several
others
being
*NL*
wounded
;
went
bleeding
away
,
as
we
could
very
plainly
discover
by
the
*NL*
snow
.
And
now
remembering
what
had
been
often
told
me
,
that
such
was
the
*NL*
majesty
of
a
man
's
voice
,
as
to
strike
terror
even
in
the
fiercest
*NL*
creatures
,
I
ordered
all
our
companions
to
halloo
as
loud
as
possible
;
*NL*
and
in
this
notion
I
was
not
altogether
mistaken
;
for
they
immediately
*NL*
turned
about
upon
the
first
halloo
,
and
began
to
retire
;
upon
which
,
*NL*
ordering
a
second
volley
in
their
rear
,
they
galloped
into
the
woods
*NL*
with
great
precipitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
we
had
some
small
time
to
load
our
pieces
again
,
and
then
made
all
*NL*
the
haste
we
could
on
our
way
;
but
we
had
not
rode
far
,
before
we
were
*NL*
obliged
to
put
ourselves
in
a
posture
of
defence
as
before
,
being
*NL*
alarmed
with
a
very
dreadful
noise
in
the
same
wood
,
on
our
left
hand
,
*NL*
the
same
way
as
we
were
to
pass
,
only
that
it
was
at
some
distance
from
*NL*
us
.
By
this
time
the
darksome
clouds
began
to
spread
over
the
elements
,
*NL*
and
the
night
growing
very
dusky
,
made
it
so
much
the
more
to
our
*NL*
disadvantage
;
but
still
the
noise
increasing
,
we
were
fully
assured
,
*NL*
that
it
was
the
howling
and
the
yelling
of
those
ravenous
creatures
;
*NL*
when
presently
three
troops
of
wolves
on
our
front
appeared
in
sight
,
as
*NL*
though
a
great
number
of
them
had
a
design
to
surround
us
,
and
devour
us
*NL*
in
spite
of
fate
.
But
as
they
did
not
fall
upon
us
immediately
,
we
*NL*
proceeded
on
our
journey
in
as
swift
a
manner
as
the
roads
would
permit
*NL*
our
horses
,
which
was
only
a
large
trot
.
It
was
in
this
manner
we
*NL*
travelled
,
till
such
a
time
as
we
discovered
another
wood
,
and
had
the
*NL*
prospect
of
its
entrance
through
which
were
to
pass
,
at
the
farthest
*NL*
side
of
the
plain
.
But
surely
none
can
express
the
terror
we
were
in
,
*NL*
when
approaching
the
lane
,
we
perceived
a
confused
number
of
the
*NL*
fiercest
wolves
,
standing
,
as
it
were
guarding
its
entrance
.
Nor
were
we
*NL*
long
in
this
amazement
,
before
another
occasion
of
horror
presented
*NL*
itself
;
for
suddenly
we
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
at
another
opening
in
*NL*
the
wood
and
,
looking
that
way
,
out
ran
a
horse
bridled
and
saddled
,
*NL*
flying
with
the
greatest
swiftness
,
and
no
less
than
sixteen
or
*NL*
seventeen
wolves
pursuing
after
him
,
in
order
to
devour
the
poor
*NL*
creature
;
and
unquestionably
they
did
so
,
after
they
had
run
him
down
,
*NL*
not
being
able
to
hold
out
that
swiftness
with
which
he
at
first
*NL*
escaped
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
rode
up
to
that
entrance
from
whence
the
horse
came
forth
,
there
*NL*
lay
the
carcases
of
another
horse
&
two
men
,
mangled
and
torn
by
these
*NL*
devouring
wolves
;
and
undoubtedly
one
of
these
men
was
the
person
who
*NL*
fired
the
gun
which
we
had
heard
,
for
the
piece
lay
by
him
;
but
alas
!
*NL*
most
of
the
upper
part
of
his
body
and
his
head
were
entombed
in
the
*NL*
bowels
of
these
ravenous
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
course
to
take
,
whether
to
proceed
or
retreat
,
we
could
not
tell
;
*NL*
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
wolves
themselves
made
us
to
come
to
a
*NL*
resolution
;
for
such
numbers
surrounded
us
,
every
one
of
whom
expected
*NL*
their
prey
,
that
were
our
bodies
to
be
divided
among
them
,
there
would
*NL*
not
be
half
a
mouthful
a-piece
.
But
happy
,
very
happy
it
was
for
us
,
*NL*
that
but
a
little
way
from
the
entrance
,
there
lay
some
very
large
*NL*
timber
trees
,
which
I
supposed
had
been
cut
down
and
laid
there
for
*NL*
sale
:
amongst
which
I
drew
my
little
troop
,
placing
ourselves
in
a
line
*NL*
behind
one
long
tree
,
which
served
us
for
a
breast
work
,
when
desiring
*NL*
them
to
alight
,
we
stood
in
a
triangle
,
or
three
fronts
,
closing
our
*NL*
bodies
in
the
centre
,
the
only
place
where
we
could
preserve
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
certainly
was
there
a
more
furious
charge
than
what
the
wolves
*NL*
made
upon
us
in
this
place
:
and
the
sight
of
the
horses
,
which
was
the
*NL*
principal
prey
they
aimed
at
,
provoked
their
hunger
,
and
added
to
their
*NL*
natural
fierceness
.
They
came
on
us
with
a
most
dreadful
noise
,
that
*NL*
made
the
woods
ring
again
:
and
beginning
to
mount
the
pieces
of
timber
,
*NL*
I
ordered
every
man
to
fire
,
as
before
directed
:
and
,
indeed
,
so
well
*NL*
did
they
take
their
aim
,
that
they
killed
several
of
the
wolves
at
the
*NL*
first
volley
;
but
still
we
were
obliged
to
keep
a
continual
firing
,
by
*NL*
reason
they
came
on
like
devils
,
pushing
one
another
with
the
greatest
*NL*
fury
.
But
our
second
volley
something
abated
their
courage
,
when
*NL*
stopping
a
little
,
we
hoped
they
would
have
made
the
best
of
their
way
,
*NL*
however
,
it
did
not
prove
so
,
for
others
made
a
new
attempt
upon
us
;
and
*NL*
though
in
four
firings
,
we
killed
seventeen
or
eighteen
of
them
,
laming
*NL*
twice
as
many
,
yet
they
several
times
successively
came
on
,
as
though
*NL*
they
valued
not
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
their
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unwilling
was
I
to
spend
our
last
shot
too
suddenly
,
and
therefore
*NL*
calling
my
other
servant
,
and
giving
him
a
horn
of
powder
,
bid
him
lay
a
*NL*
large
train
quite
along
the
timber
,
which
he
did
,
while
Friday
was
*NL*
charging
my
fusee
and
his
own
,
with
the
greatest
dexterity
.
By
this
time
*NL*
the
wolves
coming
up
the
timber
,
I
set
fire
to
the
train
,
by
snapping
a
*NL*
discharged
pistol
close
to
the
powder
.
This
so
scorched
and
terrified
*NL*
them
,
that
some
fell
down
,
and
others
jumped
in
among
us
:
but
there
*NL*
were
immediately
dispatched
,
when
all
the
rest
,
frighted
with
the
*NL*
light
,
which
the
darksome
night
caused
to
appear
more
dreadful
,
began
at
*NL*
length
to
retire
;
upon
which
ordering
our
last
pistols
to
be
fired
at
*NL*
once
,
giving
at
the
same
time
a
great
shout
,
the
wolves
were
obliged
to
*NL*
have
recourse
to
their
swiftness
,
and
turn
tail
;
and
then
we
sallied
out
*NL*
upon
twenty
lame
ones
,
cutting
them
in
pieces
with
our
swords
,
which
*NL*
obliged
them
to
howl
lamentably
,
to
the
terror
of
their
fellows
,
who
*NL*
resigned
to
us
the
field
as
victorious
conquerors
.
And
,
indeed
,
I
*NL*
question
whether
Alexander
king
of
Macedonia
,
in
any
of
his
conquests
,
*NL*
had
more
occasion
for
triumph
than
we
had
;
for
he
was
but
attacked
with
*NL*
numerous
armies
of
soldiers
;
whereas
our
little
army
was
obliged
to
*NL*
combat
a
legion
of
devils
,
as
it
were
,
worse
than
the
cannibals
,
who
,
*NL*
the
same
moment
they
had
slain
us
,
would
have
sacrificed
us
,
to
satisfy
*NL*
their
voracious
appetites
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
our
bloody
battle
with
the
beasts
,
having
killed
threescore
*NL*
of
them
,
and
saved
our
lives
from
their
fury
.
We
still
had
a
league
*NL*
further
to
go
,
when
,
as
we
went
,
our
ears
were
saluted
with
their
most
*NL*
unwelcome
howlings
,
and
we
expected
every
moment
another
attack
.
But
,
in
*NL*
an
hour
's
time
,
we
arrived
at
the
town
where
we
were
to
lodge
;
and
here
*NL*
we
found
the
place
strictly
guarded
,
and
all
in
terrible
confusion
,
as
*NL*
well
they
might
,
for
fear
of
the
bears
and
wolves
breaking
into
the
*NL*
village
,
in
order
to
prey
upon
their
cattle
and
people
.
The
next
morning
*NL*
we
were
obliged
to
take
a
new
guide
,
by
reason
the
other
fell
very
bad
*NL*
of
his
wounds
,
which
he
had
received
as
before
mentioned
.
After
we
had
*NL*
reached
Tholouse
,
we
came
into
a
warm
,
pleasant
,
and
fruitful
country
,
*NL*
not
infested
with
wolves
,
nor
any
sort
of
ravenous
creatures
:
and
when
*NL*
we
told
our
story
there
,
they
much
blamed
our
guide
,
for
conducting
us
*NL*
through
the
forest
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
,
in
such
a
severe
*NL*
season
,
when
the
snow
obliged
the
wolves
to
seek
for
shelter
in
the
*NL*
woods
.
When
we
informed
them
in
what
manner
we
placed
ourselves
,
and
the
*NL*
horses
in
the
centre
,
they
exceedingly
reprehended
us
,
and
told
us
,
it
*NL*
was
an
hundred
to
one
,
but
we
had
been
all
destroyed
;
for
that
it
was
*NL*
the
very
sight
of
the
horses
,
their
so
much
desired
prey
,
that
made
the
*NL*
wolves
more
ragingly
furious
than
they
would
have
been
,
which
was
*NL*
evident
,
by
their
being
at
other
times
really
afraid
of
a
gun
;
but
then
*NL*
being
exceedingly
hungry
and
furious
upon
that
account
,
their
eagerness
*NL*
to
come
at
the
horses
made
them
insensible
of
their
danger
;
and
that
,
if
*NL*
we
had
not
,
by
a
continual
fire
,
and
at
last
by
the
cunning
stratagem
of
*NL*
the
train
of
powder
,
got
the
better
of
them
,
it
had
been
great
odds
if
*NL*
their
number
had
not
overpowered
us
;
besides
,
it
was
a
great
mercy
we
*NL*
alighted
from
our
horses
,
and
fought
them
with
that
courage
and
conduct
,
*NL*
which
,
had
we
failed
to
do
,
every
man
of
us
,
with
our
beasts
,
had
been
*NL*
devoured
:
and
,
indeed
,
this
was
nothing
but
truth
;
for
never
in
my
life
*NL*
was
I
so
sensible
of
danger
,
as
when
three
hundred
,
devils
came
roaring
*NL*
upon
us
,
to
shun
whose
unwelcome
company
,
if
I
was
sure
to
meet
a
storm
*NL*
every
week
;
I
would
rather
go
a
thousand
leagues
by
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
have
,
nothing
uncommon
in
my
passage
through
France
to
take
*NL*
notice
of
,
since
other
travellers
of
greater
learning
and
ingenuity
,
*NL*
have
given
more
ample
account
than
my
pen
is
able
to
set
forth
.
From
*NL*
Tholouse
I
travelled
to
Paris
,
from
thence
to
Calais
,
where
I
took
*NL*
shipping
,
and
landed
at
Dover
the
14th
of
January
,
in
a
very
*NL*
cold
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
come
to
the
end
of
my
travels
,
I
soon
discovered
my
new
found
*NL*
estate
,
and
all
the
bills
of
exchange
I
had
were
currently
paid
.
The
*NL*
good
ancient
widow
,
my
only
privy
counsellor
,
thought
no
pains
nor
care
*NL*
too
great
to
procure
my
advantage
,
nor
had
I
ever
occasion
to
blame
her
*NL*
fidelity
,
which
drew
from
me
an
ample
reward
.
I
was
for
leaving
my
*NL*
effects
in
her
hands
,
intending
to
set
out
for
Lisbon
,
and
so
the
*NL*
Brazils
;
but
as
in
the
Desolate
Island
I
had
some
doubt
about
the
Romish
*NL*
religion
,
so
I
knew
there
was
little
encouragement
to
settle
there
,
*NL*
unless
I
would
apostatize
from
the
orthodox
faith
,
or
live
in
continual
*NL*
fear
of
the
Inquisition
.
Upon
this
account
I
resolved
to
sell
my
*NL*
plantation
;
and
,
for
that
intent
,
I
wrote
to
my
old
friend
at
Lisbon
,
*NL*
who
returned
to
me
an
answer
to
my
great
satisfaction
;
which
was
,
that
*NL*
he
could
sell
it
to
good
account
;
however
,
if
I
thought
it
convenient
to
*NL*
give
him
liberty
to
offer
it
in
my
name
to
the
two
merchants
,
the
*NL*
survivors
of
my
trustees
residing
at
the
Brazils
,
who
consequently
knew
*NL*
its
intrinsic
value
,
having
lived
just
upon
the
spot
,
and
who
I
was
*NL*
sensible
were
very
rich
,
and
therefore
might
be
the
more
willing
to
*NL*
purchase
it
:
he
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
,
but
that
I
should
make
four
*NL*
or
five
thousand
pieces
of
eight
more
of
it
,
than
I
could
,
if
I
disposed
*NL*
of
it
in
any
other
manner
whatsoever
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
be
sure
I
could
not
but
agree
with
this
kind
and
ingenuous
*NL*
proposal
;
and
immediately
I
sent
him
an
order
to
offer
it
to
them
,
which
*NL*
he
accordingly
did
;
so
that
about
eight
months
after
,
the
ship
being
in
*NL*
that
time
returned
,
he
gave
me
a
satisfactory
account
,
that
they
not
*NL*
only
willingly
accepted
the
offer
,
but
that
they
had
also
remitted
*NL*
33,000
pieces
of
eight
to
a
correspondence
of
their
own
at
Lisbon
,
in
*NL*
order
to
pay
for
the
purchase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
,
in
return
,
I
signed
the
instrument
of
sale
,
according
to
form
,
*NL*
which
they
had
sent
from
Lisbon
,
and
returned
it
again
to
my
old
friend
,
*NL*
he
having
sent
me
,
for
me
estate
,
bills
of
three
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty-eight
thousand
pieces
of
eight
,
reserving
the
payment
of
one
*NL*
hundred
moidores
per
annum
,
which
I
had
allowed
him
during
life
,
*NL*
likewise
:
fifty
to
his
son
during
life
also
,
according
to
my
faithful
*NL*
promise
,
which
the
plantation
was
to
make
good
as
a
rent
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
having
led
my
reader
to
the
knowledge
of
the
first
parts
of
my
*NL*
life
so
remarkable
for
the
many
peculiar
providences
that
attended
it
,
*NL*
floating
in
the
ocean
of
uncertainty
and
disappointment
,
of
adversity
*NL*
and
prosperity
,
beginning
foolishly
,
and
yet
ending
happily
;
methinks
*NL*
now
that
I
am
come
to
a
safe
&
pleasant
haven
,
it
is
time
to
cast
out
my
*NL*
anchor
,
&
c
,
laying
up
my
vessel
,
bid
,
for
a
while
,
adieu
to
foreign
*NL*
adventures
.
I
had
no
other
concerns
to
look
after
but
the
care
of
my
*NL*
brother
's
two
sons
,
which
,
with
the
good
widow
's
persuasions
,
obliged
me
*NL*
to
continue
at
home
seven
years
.
One
of
these
children
I
bred
up
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
the
other
an
experienced
sailor
,
remarkable
for
his
*NL*
courage
and
bravery
.
Besides
this
,
I
married
a
virtuous
young
*NL*
gentlewoman
,
of
a
very
good
family
,
by
whom
I
had
two
sons
and
one
*NL*
daughter
.
But
my
dear
and
tender
wife
leaving
this
earthly
stage
-LRB-
as
in
*NL*
the
second
part
of
my
life
you
will
hear
-RRB-
which
rent
my
soul
as
it
were
*NL*
asunder
,
my
native
country
became
weary
and
tiresome
to
me
;
and
my
*NL*
nephew
happening
to
come
from
sea
,
tempted
me
to
venture
another
voyage
*NL*
to
the
East
Indies
,
which
I
did
in
the
year
1694
,
at
which
time
I
*NL*
visited
my
island
,
and
informed
myself
of
every
thing
that
happened
*NL*
since
my
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
might
reasonably
imagine
,
that
what
I
had
suffered
,
together
with
an
*NL*
advanced
age
,
and
the
fear
of
losing
not
only
what
I
had
gotten
,
but
my
*NL*
life
also
,
might
have
choaked
up
all
the
seeds
of
youthful
ambition
and
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
put
a
lasting
period
to
my
wandering
inclinations
.
But
as
*NL*
nothing
but
death
can
fully
allay
the
active
part
of
my
life
,
no
less
*NL*
remarkable
for
the
many
various
contingencies
of
it
,
you
will
next
*NL*
perceive
how
I
visited
my
little
kingdom
,
saw
my
successors
the
*NL*
Spaniards
,
had
an
account
of
the
usage
they
met
with
from
the
*NL*
Englishmen
,
agreeing
and
disagreeing
,
uniting
and
separating
,
till
at
*NL*
last
they
were
subjected
to
the
Spaniards
,
who
yet
used
them
very
*NL*
honorably
,
together
with
the
wonderful
and
successful
battles
over
the
*NL*
Indians
who
invaded
,
and
thought
to
have
conquered
the
island
,
but
were
*NL*
repelled
by
their
invincible
courage
and
bravery
,
having
taken
eleven
*NL*
men
and
five
woman
prisoners
by
which
at
my
return
,
I
found
about
twenty
*NL*
young
children
on
my
little
kingdom
.
Here
I
staid
twenty
days
,
left
them
*NL*
supplies
of
all
necessary
things
,
as
also
a
carpenter
and
smith
,
and
*NL*
shared
the
islands
into
parts
,
reserving
the
whole
property
to
myself
.
*NL*
Nor
will
you
be
insensible
,
by
the
account
of
these
things
,
of
several
*NL*
new
adventures
I
have
been
engaged
in
,
the
battles
I
have
fought
,
the
*NL*
deliverances
I
have
met
with
;
and
while
,
in
the
surprising
relation
of
*NL*
such
remarkable
occurrences
,
I
shall
describe
many
of
God
's
kindest
*NL*
providences
to
me
in
particular
,
no
less
conspicuous
in
the
same
*NL*
goodness
,
power
,
and
majesty
of
our
great
creator
,
shown
one
way
or
*NL*
other

THE
FURTHER
ADVENTURES
OF
*NL*
*NL*
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wherein
are
contained
several
strange
and
surprising
accounts
of
his
*NL*
travels
,
and
his
most
remarkable
transactions
both
by
sea
and
by
land
;
*NL*
with
his
wonderful
vision
of
the
angelic
world
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
consider
the
puissant
force
of
Nature
and
,
what
mighty
influence
*NL*
it
has
many
times
over
the
temper
of
the
mind
,
it
will
be
no
such
great
*NL*
wonder
to
think
,
that
my
powerful
reason
should
be
overcome
by
a
much
*NL*
stronger
inclination
.
My
late
acquired
kingdom
ran
continually
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
all
the
day
,
and
I
dreamed
of
it
in
the
night
:
nay
,
I
made
it
*NL*
the
continual
subject
of
my
talk
,
even
to
impertinence
,
when
I
was
*NL*
awake
.
I
had
such
vapours
in
my
head
,
that
I
actually
supposed
myself
at
*NL*
my
castle
;
that
I
not
only
perceived
Friday
's
father
the
old
Spaniard
,
*NL*
and
the
wicked
sailors
,
but
that
I
talked
and
discoursed
with
them
about
*NL*
their
manner
of
living
;
that
I
heard
the
things
related
to
me
,
which
I
*NL*
found
afterwards
to
be
true
;
&
that
I
executed
my
judgments
with
the
*NL*
greatest
severity
upon
the
offenders
.
And
,
indeed
,
this
anticipating
all
*NL*
the
pleasing
joys
of
my
life
,
scarcely
afforded
me
one
pleasant
hour
:
my
*NL*
dear
and
tender
wife
could
not
but
take
notice
of
it
,
which
drew
those
*NL*
affectionate
speeches
from
her
:
_
My
dear
,
_
said
she
,
_
I
am
really
*NL*
persuaded
that
some
secret
impulse
from
Heaven
occasions
in
you
a
*NL*
determination
to
see
the
island
again
;
nor
am
I
less
sensible
,
but
your
*NL*
being
engaged
to
me
and
these
dear
children
is
the
only
hinderance
of
*NL*
your
departure
.
I
know
my
dear
,
if
I
were
in
the
grave
,
you
would
not
*NL*
long
continue
at
home
;
prevent
not
your
happiness
on
my
account
,
whose
*NL*
only
comfort
centres
in
you
.
All
that
I
can
object
is
,
that
such
an
*NL*
hazardous
undertaking
is
no
way
consistent
with
a
person
of
your
years
;
*NL*
but
if
you
are
resolved
to
go
,
_
added
she
,
weeping
,
_
only
permit
me
to
*NL*
bear
you
company
,
and
that
is
all
that
I
desire
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Such
endearing
tenderness
,
graced
with
the
most
innocent
and
yet
most
*NL*
powerful
charms
,
brought
me
insensibly
into
my
right
understanding
;
and
*NL*
when
I
considered
all
the
transactions
of
my
life
,
and
particularly
my
*NL*
new
engagement
,
that
I
had
now
one
child
already
born
,
and
my
wife
big
*NL*
of
another
;
and
that
I
had
no
occasion
to
seek
for
more
riches
,
who
*NL*
already
was
blessed
with
sufficiency
,
with
much
struggling
I
altered
my
*NL*
resolutions
at
last
,
resolving
to
apply
myself
to
some
business
or
*NL*
other
,
which
might
put
a
period
to
such
wandering
inclinations
.
Hereupon
*NL*
I
bought
a
little
farm
in
the
county
of
Bedford
,
with
a
resolution
to
*NL*
move
thither
;
upon
this
there
was
a
pretty
convenient
house
surrounded
*NL*
with
land
,
very
capable
of
improvement
,
which
suited
my
temper
,
as
to
*NL*
planting
,
managing
,
and
cultivating
.
Nor
was
I
long
before
I
entered
*NL*
upon
my
new
settlement
,
having
bought
ploughs
,
harrows
,
carts
,
waggons
,
*NL*
horses
,
cows
,
and
sheep
;
so
that
I
now
led
the
life
of
a
country
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
as
happy
in
my
retirement
as
the
greatest
monarch
in
the
*NL*
world
.
And
what
made
me
think
my
happiness
the
greater
was
,
that
I
was
*NL*
in
the
middle
state
of
life
,
which
my
father
had
so
often
recommended
,
*NL*
much
resembling
the
felicity
of
a
rural
retirement
,
which
is
elegantly
*NL*
described
by
the
poet
in
these
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Free
from
all
vices
,
free
from
care
,
*NL*
Age
has
no
pain
,
and
youth
no
snare
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
the
midst
of
this
my
happiness
,
I
was
suddenly
plunged
in
the
*NL*
greatest
sorrow
that
I
could
possibly
endure
;
for
when
I
least
expected
*NL*
it
,
my
dear
and
tender
wife
was
forced
to
submit
to
the
irresistable
*NL*
power
of
Death
,
leaving
this
transitory
life
for
a
better
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
beauties
of
her
mind
,
or
the
loveliness
*NL*
of
her
person
;
neither
can
I
too
much
lament
her
loss
,
which
my
latest
*NL*
breath
shall
record
;
her
influence
was
greater
over
me
,
than
the
powers
*NL*
of
my
own
reason
,
the
importunities
of
friends
,
the
instructions
of
a
*NL*
father
,
or
the
melting
tears
of
a
tender
and
disconsolate
mother
;
in
a
*NL*
word
,
she
was
the
spirit
of
all
my
affairs
,
and
the
centre
of
my
*NL*
enterprizes
.
But
now
,
since
the
cruel
hand
of
Death
had
closed
my
*NL*
dearest
's
eyes
,
I
seemed
in
my
thoughts
a
stranger
to
the
world
;
my
*NL*
privy
counsellor
being
gone
,
I
was
like
a
ship
without
a
pilot
,
that
*NL*
could
only
run
before
the
wind
.
And
when
I
looked
around
me
in
this
busy
*NL*
world
,
one
party
labouring
for
bread
,
and
the
other
squandering
away
*NL*
their
estates
;
this
put
me
in
mind
how
I
had
lived
in
my
little
kingdom
,
*NL*
where
both
reason
and
religion
dictated
to
me
,
that
there
was
something
*NL*
that
certainly
was
the
reason
and
end
of
life
,
which
was
far
superior
to
*NL*
what
could
be
hoped
for
on
this
side
the
grave
.
My
country
delights
were
*NL*
now
as
insiped
and
dull
,
as
music
and
science
to
those
who
have
neither
*NL*
taste
nor
ingenuity
.
In
short
,
resolving
to
leave
off
house-keeping
,
I
*NL*
left
my
farm
,
and
in
a
few
months
returned
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
could
that
great
city
,
so
famous
for
its
variety
of
*NL*
entertainment
,
afford
me
any
agreeable
delight
;
a
state
of
idleness
I
*NL*
found
to
be
the
very
dregs
of
life
,
and
most
hurtful
to
body
and
soul
.
*NL*
It
was
now
the
beginning
of
the
year
1684
,
at
which
time
my
nephew
-LRB-
who
*NL*
as
I
before
observed
had
been
brought
up
to
the
sea
,
and
advanced
to
be
*NL*
captain
of
a
ship
-RRB-
was
returned
from
a
short
voyage
to
Bilboz
,
the
first
*NL*
he
had
made
in
that
station
.
He
comes
to
me
one
morning
,
telling
me
that
*NL*
some
merchants
of
his
acquaintance
had
proposed
to
him
to
go
a
voyage
*NL*
for
them
to
the
East
Indies
and
China
in
the
manner
of
private
traders
;
*NL*
_
and
now
uncle
_
,
said
he
,
_
if
you
'll
accompany
me
thither
,
I
'll
engage
*NL*
to
land
you
upon
your
old
island
,
to
visit
the
state
of
your
*NL*
little
kingdom
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
he
came
in
,
my
thoughts
were
fixed
to
get
a
patent
for
its
*NL*
possession
,
and
then
to
fill
it
with
inhabitants
.
After
I
had
paused
a
*NL*
while
,
and
looked
stedfastly
on
him
.
_
What
devil
or
spirit
_
,
said
I
,
*NL*
_
sent
you
with
this
unlucky
errand
_
?
He
started
at
first
;
but
recovering
*NL*
himself
,
when
he
perceived
I
was
not
offended
;
_
Sir
_
,
replied
he
,
_
what
*NL*
I
have
proposed
can
not
I
hope
,
be
styled
unlucky
,
since
certainly
you
*NL*
must
be
desirous
to
see
your
little
territory
,
where
you
reigned
with
*NL*
more
content
,
than
any
of
your
brother
kings
in
the
universe
.
Nephew
_
,
*NL*
said
I
,
_
if
you
will
leave
me
there
,
and
call
for
me
as
you
came
back
,
I
*NL*
care
not
if
I
give
my
consent
_
:
but
he
answered
,
_
that
the
merchants
*NL*
would
not
allow
their
vessel
loaden
with
an
infinite
value
,
to
return
*NL*
there
again
,
which
was
a
month
's
sail
out
of
the
way
;
besides
,
Sir
_
said
*NL*
he
,
_
if
I
should
miscarry
,
was
your
request
granted
,
why
then
you
would
*NL*
be
locked
up
as
before
_
.
This
indeed
carried
a
great
deal
of
reason
in
*NL*
it
;
but
we
found
out
a
remedy
,
and
that
was
to
carry
a
framed
sloop
on
*NL*
board
,
ready
to
be
set
up
in
the
island
,
by
the
assistance
of
some
*NL*
carpenters
,
which
we
should
carry
with
us
,
that
might
be
fitted
in
a
few
*NL*
days
to
go
to
sea
.
I
was
not
long
in
forming
my
resolution
,
which
*NL*
overswayed
my
good
friend
the
widow
's
persuasions
,
and
the
natural
*NL*
affection
I
bore
to
my
young
children
.
I
made
my
will
,
and
settled
my
*NL*
estate
in
such
manner
,
that
I
was
perfectly
sure
my
poor
infants
would
*NL*
have
justice
done
them
.
The
good
widow
not
only
undertook
to
make
*NL*
provision
,
for
my
voyage
,
but
also
took
the
charge
of
my
domestic
*NL*
affairs
,
and
to
provide
for
my
children
's
education
;
and
indeed
no
*NL*
mother
could
take
more
care
,
or
understood
that
office
better
;
for
which
*NL*
I
lived
to
reward
and
return
her
my
hearty
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beginning
of
January
,
1694.5
,
my
nephew
being
ready
to
sail
,
I
and
*NL*
Friday
went
on
board
in
the
Downs
on
the
8th
,
having
,
besides
that
sloop
*NL*
already
mentioned
,
a
very
considerable
cargo
for
my
new
colony
.
First
,
I
*NL*
had
some
servants
,
whom
I
proposed
to
leave
there
,
as
they
should
appear
*NL*
willing
;
there
were
two
carpenters
,
a
smith
,
and
a
very
ingenuous
fellow
*NL*
who
was
Jack-of-all-trades
;
for
he
was
not
only
a
cooper
by
trade
,
but
*NL*
also
he
was
dexterous
at
making
wheels
and
hand-mills
to
grind
corn
,
*NL*
likewise
a
good
turner
,
and
a
good
pot-maker
.
I
also
carried
a
tailor
,
*NL*
who
consented
to
stay
in
my
plantation
,
and
proved
a
most
necessary
*NL*
fellow
in
the
island
.
As
to
my
cargo
,
it
consisted
of
a
sufficient
*NL*
quantity
of
linen
,
and
English
stuffs
for
clothing
the
Spaniards
that
I
*NL*
expected
to
find
there
;
as
likewise
gloves
,
hats
,
shoes
,
stockings
;
*NL*
together
with
beds
,
bedding
,
and
household
stuff
,
especially
kitchen
*NL*
utensils
,
with
pots
,
kettles
,
pewter
,
brass
,
&
c.
also
nails
,
tools
of
*NL*
all
sorts
,
staples
,
hooks
,
hinges
,
and
all
other
things
necessary
;
all
*NL*
which
,
I
think
,
cost
me
about
three
hundred
pounds
.
Nor
was
this
all
for
*NL*
I
carried
an
hundred
spare
arms
,
muskets
,
&
fusees
,
besides
some
*NL*
pistols
,
a
considerable
quantity
of
several
sorts
of
shot
,
two
brass
*NL*
cannon
,
besides
swords
,
cutlasses
,
and
the
iron
part
of
some
pikes
and
*NL*
halberts
.
I
made
my
nephew
take
with
us
two
small
quarter-deck
guns
,
*NL*
more
than
he
had
occasion
for
in
his
ship
,
to
leave
behind
,
if
there
was
*NL*
a
necessity
;
so
that
we
might
build
a
fort
there
,
and
man
it
against
all
*NL*
opposers
whatsoever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
put
out
to
sea
;
and
though
I
ca
n't
say
this
voyage
was
so
*NL*
unprosperous
as
my
others
had
been
,
yet
contrary
winds
drove
us
so
far
*NL*
northward
,
that
we
were
obliged
to
put
in
at
Galway
in
Ireland
,
where
we
*NL*
lay
wind-bound
two
and
twenty
days
.
Here
indeed
our
provisions
were
very
*NL*
cheap
,
and
we
added
to
our
ship
's
stores
by
taking
several
live
hogs
,
*NL*
two
cows
and
calves
,
which
I
then
resolved
to
put
on
shore
in
my
island
,
*NL*
if
our
necessities
did
not
call
for
them
.
On
the
5th
of
February
we
*NL*
sailed
from
Ireland
,
with
a
very
fair
gale
,
which
lasted
for
some
days
;
*NL*
and
I
think
it
was
about
the
20th
of
the
same
month
late
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
mate
informed
us
,
that
he
saw
a
flash
of
fire
,
and
heard
a
gun
*NL*
fired
:
and
when
he
was
speaking
a
boy
came
in
and
told
us
,
that
the
*NL*
boatswain
had
heard
another
.
Upon
which
we
all
ran
to
the
quarter-deck
,
*NL*
from
whence
,
in
a
few
moments
,
we
perceived
a
terrible
fire
at
a
*NL*
distance
.
We
had
immediately
recourse
to
our
reckonings
,
in
which
,
we
*NL*
were
all
of
opinion
,
that
there
could
be
no
land
that
way
,
it
appearing
*NL*
to
be
at
N.N.W.
Hereupon
we
concluded
that
some
ship
had
taken
fire
at
*NL*
sea
,
and
that
it
could
not
be
far
off
by
the
report
of
the
guns
which
we
*NL*
had
heard
.
We
made
up
directly
to
it
,
and
in
half
an
hour
's
time
the
*NL*
wind
being
fair
,
we
could
plainly
perceive
a
great
ship
on
fire
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
sea
.
Touched
with
this
unhappy
disaster
,
and
considering
*NL*
my
former
circumstances
,
when
the
Portuguese
Captain
took
me
up
,
I
*NL*
immediately
ordered
five
guns
to
be
fired
that
the
poor
creatures
,
not
*NL*
seeing
us
,
it
being
dark
,
-LRB-
though
we
could
perceive
their
flame
-RRB-
might
*NL*
be
sensible
there
was
deliverance
at
hand
,
and
consequently
might
*NL*
endeavor
to
save
themselves
in
their
boat
.
Nor
was
it
long
before
the
*NL*
ship
blew
up
in
the
air
and
the
fire
was
extinguished
in
the
ocean
.
But
*NL*
supposing
them
all
to
be
in
their
boats
,
we
hung
out
our
lanterns
and
*NL*
kept
firing
till
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
when
with
our
*NL*
perspectives
,
we
beheld
two
boats
full
of
people
making
towards
us
tho
'
*NL*
the
tide
was
against
them
then
spreading
out
our
ancient
;
and
hanging
*NL*
out
a
waft
,
as
a
signal
for
them
to
come
on
board
,
in
half
an
hour
's
*NL*
time
;
we
came
up
to
them
,
and
took
them
all
in
,
there
being
no
less
than
*NL*
sixty-four
men
,
women
,
and
children
.
It
was
a
French
merchant
ship
of
*NL*
three
hundred
tons
;
homeward
bound
from
Quebec
in
the
river
of
Canada
.
*NL*
The
master
informed
me
how
,
by
the
negligence
of
the
steersman
,
the
*NL*
steerage
was
set
on
fire
:
that
,
at
his
outcry
for
help
,
the
fire
was
,
as
*NL*
we
thought
totally
extinguished
;
but
,
that
some
sparks
getting
between
*NL*
the
timber
,
and
within
the
ceiling
,
it
proceeded
into
the
hold
,
where
*NL*
there
was
no
resisting
it
;
&
then
they
got
into
their
boats
,
as
*NL*
creatures
in
the
last
extremity
,
with
what
provision
they
had
,
together
*NL*
with
oars
,
sails
,
and
a
compass
,
intending
to
go
back
to
Newfoundland
,
*NL*
the
wind
blowing
at
S.E.
and
by
E.
though
there
were
several
chances
*NL*
against
them
as
storms
to
overset
and
founder
them
,
rains
and
colds
to
*NL*
benumb
and
perish
their
limbs
,
and
contrary
winds
to
keep
them
back
and
*NL*
starve
them
;
_
But
_
,
said
he
,
_
in
this
our
great
distress
we
heard
the
*NL*
welcome
report
of
your
guns
,
when
with
unspeakable
joy
,
taking
down
our
*NL*
masts
and
sails
,
we
were
resolved
to
lie
by
till
morning
;
but
perceiving
*NL*
your
light
,
we
set
our
oars
at
work
,
to
keep
our
boat
a
head
,
the
sooner
*NL*
to
attain
your
ship
,
the
happy
instrument
of
our
deliverance
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
no
one
can
express
the
joy
of
these
poor
creatures
on
this
*NL*
occasion
:
fear
and
grief
are
easily
set
forth
;
sighs
and
tears
,
with
a
*NL*
few
motions
of
the
hands
and
head
,
are
all
the
demonstrations
of
these
*NL*
passions
;
but
an
excess
of
joy
,
carries
in
it
a
thousand
extravagancies
;
*NL*
especially
,
I
think
,
among
the
French
,
whose
temper
is
allowed
to
be
*NL*
more
volatile
,
passionate
,
sprightly
,
and
gay
,
than
that
of
other
*NL*
nations
.
Some
were
weeping
,
tearing
themselves
in
the
greatest
agonies
*NL*
of
sorrow
,
and
running
stark
mad
about
the
ship
,
while
the
rest
were
*NL*
stamping
with
their
feet
,
wringing
their
hands
,
singing
,
laughing
,
*NL*
swooning
away
,
vomiting
,
fainting
,
with
a
few
returning
hearty
thanks
to
*NL*
the
Almighty
;
and
crossing
themselves
.
I
think
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
*NL*
our
surgeon
was
obliged
to
let
thirty
of
them
blood
.
But
among
the
*NL*
passengers
,
there
were
two
priests
,
the
one
an
old
,
and
the
other
a
*NL*
young
man
;
but
what
amazed
me
more
was
,
that
the
oldest
was
in
the
worst
*NL*
plight
;
for
no
sooner
did
he
perceive
himself
freed
from
danger
,
but
he
*NL*
dropt
down
as
it
were
without
life
,
and
to
every
one
's
appearance
quite
*NL*
dead
;
but
the
surgeon
chasing
and
rubbing
his
arm
,
opened
a
vein
,
which
*NL*
at
first
dropped
,
and
then
flowing
more
freely
,
the
old
man
began
to
*NL*
open
his
eyes
;
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
well
again
.
But
soon
*NL*
remembering
this
happy
change
,
the
joy
of
which
whirled
his
blood
about
*NL*
faster
than
the
vessels
could
convey
it
,
he
became
so
feverish
,
as
made
*NL*
him
more
fit
for
bedlam
than
any
other
place
.
But
the
surgeon
giving
*NL*
him
a
sleepy
dose
,
he
was
perfectly
composed
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remarkable
indeed
was
the
behaviour
of
the
young
priest
.
At
his
entrance
*NL*
on
board
the
ship
,
he
fell
on
his
face
in
the
most
humble
prostration
to
*NL*
the
Almighty
.
I
thought
,
indeed
,
he
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
,
and
so
ran
*NL*
to
help
him
up
;
but
he
modestly
told
me
,
_
he
was
returning
his
thanks
to
*NL*
the
Almighty
,
desiring
me
to
leave
him
a
few
moments
,
and
that
,
next
to
*NL*
his
Creator
,
he
would
return
me
thanks
also
_
.
And
indeed
he
did
so
about
*NL*
three
minutes
after
,
with
great
seriousness
,
and
affection
,
while
the
*NL*
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
,
which
convinced
me
of
the
gratitude
of
his
*NL*
soul
.
Nor
did
he
less
show
his
piety
and
wisdom
in
applying
himself
to
*NL*
his
country
people
,
and
labouring
to
compose
them
,
by
the
most
powerful
*NL*
reasons
,
arguments
,
and
persuasions
.
And
when
,
indeed
,
these
people
had
*NL*
taken
their
night
's
repose
,
in
such
lodgings
as
our
ship
would
allow
,
we
*NL*
found
nothing
but
the
best
of
manners
,
and
the
most
civil
*NL*
acknowledgements
,
for
which
the
French
are
eminently
remarkable
.
The
*NL*
next
day
the
Captain
and
one
of
the
priests
desired
to
speak
with
me
and
*NL*
my
nephew
the
commander
.
They
told
us
,
_
that
they
had
saved
some
money
*NL*
and
valuable
things
out
of
the
ruined
vessel
,
which
was
at
our
service
;
*NL*
only
that
they
desired
to
be
set
on
shore
some
where
in
our
way
_
.
At
the
*NL*
first
my
nephew
was
for
accepting
the
money
;
but
I
-LRB-
who
knew
how
hard
my
*NL*
case
would
have
been
,
had
the
Portuguese
Captain
served
me
so
-RRB-
persuaded
*NL*
him
to
the
contrary
;
and
therefore
told
them
,
_
that
as
we
had
done
*NL*
nothing
but
what
we
were
obliged
to
do
,
by
nature
and
humanity
,
and
what
*NL*
we
ourselves
might
expect
from
others
in
such
calamity
;
so
we
took
them
*NL*
up
to
save
them
,
not
to
plunder
them
,
or
leave
them
naked
upon
the
land
,
*NL*
to
perish
for
want
of
subsistance
,
and
therefore
would
not
accept
their
*NL*
money
:
but
as
to
landing
them
,
that
was
a
great
difficulty
;
for
being
*NL*
bound
to
the
East
Indies
,
it
was
impossible
wilfully
to
change
our
*NL*
voyage
upon
their
particular
account
,
nor
could
my
nephew
_
-LRB-
who
was
*NL*
under
charter
party
to
pursue
it
by
was
of
Brazil
-RRB-
_
answer
it
to
the
*NL*
freighters
_
.
All
that
we
could
do
,
was
to
put
ourselves
in
the
way
of
*NL*
meeting
some
ships
homeward
bound
from
the
West
Indies
,
that
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
they
might
get
a
passage
to
France
or
England
.
Indeed
,
they
*NL*
were
very
thankful
for
our
first
kindness
;
but
were
under
great
concern
,
*NL*
especially
the
passengers
,
at
their
being
carried
to
the
East
Indies
.
*NL*
_
They
begged
therefore
,
I
would
keep
on
the
banks
of
Newfoundland
,
*NL*
where
,
probably
,
they
might
meet
with
some
ship
,
or
sloop
to
carry
them
*NL*
to
Canada
,
whence
they
came
.
_
As
this
was
but
a
reasonable
request
,
I
*NL*
was
inclined
to
grant
it
,
since
it
was
no
breach
of
charter
party
,
and
*NL*
that
the
laws
of
God
and
nature
obliged
us
to
do
what
good
we
could
to
*NL*
our
fellow-creatures
;
and
besides
the
danger
we
ourselves
should
be
in
*NL*
for
want
of
provisions
:
so
we
consented
to
carry
them
to
Newfoundland
,
*NL*
if
wind
and
weather
would
permit
;
if
not
,
that
we
should
carry
them
to
*NL*
Martinico
in
the
West
Indies
.
But
,
as
it
happened
,
in
a
week
's
time
we
*NL*
made
the
banks
of
Newfoundland
,
where
the
French
people
hired
a
bark
to
*NL*
carry
them
to
France
.
But
the
young
priest
being
desirous
to
go
to
the
*NL*
East
Indies
,
I
readily
agreed
to
it
,
because
I
liked
his
conversation
,
*NL*
and
two
or
three
of
the
French
sailors
also
entered
themselves
on
*NL*
board
our
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
directing
our
course
for
the
West
Indies
,
steering
S.
and
S.
by
E.
*NL*
about
twenty
days
,
with
little
wind
,
another
adventure
happened
to
*NL*
exercise
our
humanity
.
In
the
latitude
of
27
degrees
,
5
minutes
north
,
*NL*
the
19th
of
March
1694-5
,
we
perceived
a
sail
,
-LRB-
our
course
S.
E.
and
by
*NL*
S.
-RRB-
which
bore
upon
us
,
and
then
she
appeared
to
be
a
large
vessel
,
*NL*
having
lost
her
main
topmast
and
boltsprit
;
when
firing
a
gun
as
a
*NL*
signal
of
distress
,
wind
N.
N.W.
we
soon
came
to
speak
with
her
.
She
was
*NL*
a
ship
from
Bristol
,
bound
home
from
Barbadoes
,
out
of
which
road
she
*NL*
had
been
forced
in
a
hurricane
to
the
westward
,
in
which
they
lost
*NL*
their
masts
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
told
us
,
_
their
expectations
were
to
see
the
Bahama
islands
,
but
*NL*
were
driven
away
by
a
strong
wind
at
N.N.W.
and
having
no
sails
to
work
*NL*
the
ship
with
,
but
the
main-course
and
a
kind
of
square
sail
upon
a
jury
*NL*
foremast
,
because
they
could
not
come
near
the
land
,
were
endeavouring
*NL*
to
stand
for
the
Canaries
:
nay
what
was
worse
,
besides
all
their
*NL*
fatigue
,
they
were
almost
starved
for
want
of
provision
,
having
ate
*NL*
nothing
for
eleven
all
that
they
had
aboard
,
was
sugar
,
a
barrel
of
*NL*
fresh
water
and
seven
casks
of
rum
_
.
In
this
ship
were
passengers
,
a
*NL*
youth
,
his
mother
,
and
a
maid-servant
,
who
were
in
a
most
deplorable
*NL*
condition
for
want
of
food
.
If
I
had
not
gone
on
board
their
ship
,
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
their
misery
had
been
concealed
from
me
,
and
they
would
*NL*
have
inevitably
perished
;
though
,
indeed
,
their
second
mate
who
was
*NL*
Captain
,
by
reason
the
true
Captain
was
not
on
board
when
the
hurricane
*NL*
happened
,
had
before
informed
me
that
there
was
such
persons
on
board
,
*NL*
whom
he
supposed
to
be
dead
,
being
afraid
to
inquire
after
them
,
because
*NL*
he
had
nothing
to
give
them
for
relief
.
Hereupon
we
resolved
to
let
them
*NL*
have
what
we
could
spare
,
ordering
the
mate
to
bring
some
of
his
men
on
*NL*
board
us
,
which
he
did
accordingly
:
as
he
and
they
looked
like
*NL*
skeletons
,
when
meat
was
set
before
them
,
I
ordered
them
to
eat
*NL*
sparingly
.
But
,
however
they
soon
fell
sick
;
which
obliged
the
surgeon
*NL*
to
mix
something
in
their
broth
,
which
was
to
be
to
them
both
food
and
*NL*
physic
.
When
they
were
fed
,
we
ordered
our
mate
to
carry
them
a
sack
of
*NL*
bread
,
and
four
or
five
pieces
of
beef
;
but
the
surgeon
charged
them
to
*NL*
see
it
boiled
,
and
to
keep
a
guard
on
the
cook-room
,
to
prevent
the
men
*NL*
from
eating
it
raw
,
and
consequently
killing
themselves
with
what
was
*NL*
designed
for
their
relief
.
But
,
particularly
,
I
desired
the
mate
to
see
*NL*
what
condition
the
poor
passengers
were
in
,
and
the
surgeon
gave
him
a
*NL*
pitcher
of
the
same
broth
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
men
.
And
being
*NL*
curious
to
see
this
scene
of
misery
myself
,
I
took
the
Captain
-LRB-
as
we
*NL*
called
the
mate
of
the
ship
-RRB-
in
our
own
boat
,
and
sailed
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
sad
sight
indeed
!
scarce
were
the
victuals
half
boiled
in
the
*NL*
pot
;
but
they
were
ready
to
break
open
the
cook-room
door
.
To
stay
their
*NL*
stomachs
the
mate
gave
them
biscuits
,
which
were
dipped
in
and
softened
*NL*
them
with
the
liquor
of
the
meat
,
which
they
call
_
bruise
_
;
telling
*NL*
them
,
it
was
for
their
own
safety
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
give
them
but
*NL*
a
little
at
a
time
;
and
so
feeding
them
gradually
,
their
bellies
were
*NL*
comfortable
filled
,
and
the
men
did
very
well
again
.
But
when
they
came
*NL*
to
the
poor
gentlewoman
in
the
cabin
,
who
for
several
days
had
continued
*NL*
without
food
,
giving
what
she
had
to
her
son
,
they
found
her
as
it
were
*NL*
in
the
arms
of
death
.
She
was
sitting
upon
the
floor
of
the
deck
,
with
*NL*
her
back
up
against
the
sides
,
between
two
chairs
,
which
were
lashed
*NL*
fast
,
and
her
head
shrunk
,
between
her
shoulders
,
like
a
senseless
*NL*
corpse
.
Nothing
was
wanting
in
my
mate
to
revive
and
encourage
her
;
*NL*
opening
her
lips
,
and
putting
some
broth
into
her
mouth
with
a
spoon
.
*NL*
But
not
having
strength
to
speak
,
she
lifted
up
her
head
with
much
*NL*
difficulty
,
intimating
that
it
was
now
too
late
!
at
the
same
time
*NL*
pointing
to
the
youth
her
son
,
as
though
she
desired
him
to
do
what
he
*NL*
could
to
save
the
lad
;
and
in
a
little
time
after
she
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
indeed
,
was
not
so
far
gone
;
yet
lay
stretched
out
on
a
cabin
*NL*
bed
,
like
one
that
had
scarce
any
life
.
In
his
mouth
was
a
piece
of
an
*NL*
old
glove
,
the
rest
of
which
he
had
ate
up
.
At
first
he
vomited
what
the
*NL*
mate
had
given
him
;
but
at
length
began
sensibly
to
revive
,
though
in
*NL*
the
greatest
concern
for
the
death
of
his
tender
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
poor
maid
,
she
lay
by
her
mistress
,
like
one
in
the
last
pangs
*NL*
of
death
:
her
limbs
were
distorted
,
one
of
her
hands
were
clasped
round
*NL*
the
frame
of
a
chair
,
which
she
grasped
so
hard
,
that
it
was
with
some
*NL*
difficulty
we
separated
her
from
it
;
her
other
arm
lay
over
her
head
,
*NL*
and
her
feet
lay
both
together
,
set
fast
against
the
frame
of
the
cabin
*NL*
table
;
not
only
being
,
starved
with
hunger
,
but
overcome
with
grief
at
*NL*
the
loss
of
her
mistress
,
whom
she
loved
most
tenderly
.
It
was
a
great
*NL*
while
before
the
surgeon
could
bring
her
to
life
,
and
a
much
longer
time
*NL*
before
she
came
to
her
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
sailed
with
them
some
days
,
we
sent
them
five
barrels
of
*NL*
beef
,
one
of
pork
,
two
hogsheads
of
biscuit
,
with
peas
,
flour
,
and
other
*NL*
things
;
taking
three
casks
of
sugar
,
some
rum
,
and
some
pieces
of
eight
*NL*
as
payment
,
we
left
them
,
but
took
the
youth
and
maid
with
us
,
with
all
*NL*
their
goods
.
The
lad
was
about
seventeen
years
old
,
very
handsome
,
*NL*
modest
,
sensible
,
and
well-bred
,
but
mightily
concerned
for
the
loss
*NL*
of
his
honoured
mother
,
having
lost
his
father
at
Barbadoes
but
a
few
*NL*
months
before
.
He
beseeched
the
surgeon
to
intercede
with
me
to
take
him
*NL*
out
of
the
ship
;
for
that
the
sailors
,
not
sparing
a
small
sustenance
,
*NL*
had
starved
his
mother
.
But
hunger
has
no
bounds
,
no
right
,
and
*NL*
consequently
is
incapable
of
any
compassion
.
When
the
surgeon
told
him
,
*NL*
our
voyage
might
put
him
in
bad
circumstances
,
and
farther
from
his
*NL*
friends
,
he
said
_
he
did
not
care
,
if
he
was
delivered
from
that
terrible
*NL*
crew
;
that
as
the
Captain
_
-LRB-
meaning
me
-RRB-
_
had
saved
him
from
death
,
so
he
*NL*
was
sure
he
would
do
him
no
harm
;
and
,
as
for
the
maid
,
when
she
was
*NL*
restored
to
her
senses
,
she
would
be
no
less
thankful
,
let
us
carry
them
*NL*
where
we
would
_
.
And
indeed
the
surgeon
so
represented
their
case
to
me
,
*NL*
that
I
consented
,
and
took
them
on
board
with
all
their
goods
,
except
*NL*
eleven
hogsheads
of
sugar
;
but
the
youth
having
a
bill
of
lading
,
I
made
*NL*
the
commander
oblige
himself
to
deliver
a
letter
and
the
deceased
widow
's
*NL*
goods
to
Mr.
Rogers
,
a
merchant
in
Bristol
;
but
I
believe
the
ship
was
*NL*
lost
at
sea
,
for
we
never
could
hear
what
became
of
her
afterwards
.
We
*NL*
were
now
in
the
latitude
19
deg
.
32
min
.
having
as
yet
a
tolerable
good
*NL*
voyage
.
But
,
passing
by
several
little
incidents
relating
to
wind
and
*NL*
weather
,
I
shall
relate
what
is
most
remarkable
concerning
my
little
*NL*
kingdom
,
to
which
I
was
then
drawing
near
.
I
had
great
difficulty
in
*NL*
finding
it
,
for
as
I
came
to
,
and
went
from
it
before
,
on
the
south
and
*NL*
east
side
of
the
island
,
as
coming
from
the
Brazils
,
so
now
approaching
*NL*
between
the
main
and
the
island
,
not
having
any
chart
for
the
coast
,
nor
*NL*
land
mark
,
it
obliged
us
to
go
on
shore
on
several
islands
in
the
mouth
*NL*
of
the
river
Oroonoko
,
but
to
the
purpose
.
Thus
I
perceived
,
that
what
*NL*
I
thought
was
a
continent
before
,
was
no
such
thing
,
but
a
long
island
,
*NL*
or
rather
a
ridge
of
sands
.
On
one
of
these
islands
I
found
some
*NL*
Spaniards
,
but
they
belonged
to
the
isle
of
Trinidad
,
who
came
hither
*NL*
in
a
sloop
to
make
salt
,
and
try
to
find
some
pearl
muscles
.
But
at
*NL*
length
I
came
fair
on
the
south
side
of
my
island
,
and
there
I
*NL*
presently
knew
the
countenance
of
my
little
kingdom
;
so
we
brought
the
*NL*
ship
safe
to
an
anchor
,
broadside
within
the
creek
,
where
stood
my
*NL*
ancient
and
venerable
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
I
see
the
place
,
but
calling
for
Friday
,
I
asked
him
where
*NL*
he
was
?
But
when
he
looked
a
little
,
he
clapped
his
hands
,
crying
,
_
O
*NL*
joy
,
O
there
,
O
yes
,
O
there
!
_
pointing
to
our
old
abode
,
and
then
fell
*NL*
a
dancing
and
capering
as
if
he
was
mad
,
and
I
had
much
ado
to
keep
him
*NL*
from
jumping
into
the
sea
,
to
swim
ashore
.
`
Friday
,
'
said
I
,
`
what
do
you
*NL*
think
,
shall
we
go
to
see
your
father
?
'
at
the
mentioning
his
father
's
*NL*
name
,
the
poor
affectionate
creature
fell
a-weeping
:
_
No
,
no
,
_
says
he
,
*NL*
_
me
see
him
no
more
,
never
see
poor
father
more
!
he
long
ago
die
,
die
*NL*
long
ago
:
he
much
old
man
.
_
`
You
do
n't
know
that
,
'
said
I
,
`
but
shall
we
*NL*
see
any
body
else
?
'
He
looks
about
,
and
pointing
to
the
hill
above
my
*NL*
house
,
cries
out
,
_
We
see
,
we
see
there
much
men
and
there
_
:
which
,
*NL*
though
I
could
not
perceive
them
with
my
perspective
glass
,
was
true
,
*NL*
by
what
the
men
themselves
told
me
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
English
ancient
was
spread
,
and
three
guns
fired
,
as
a
signal
*NL*
of
friendship
,
we
perceived
a
smoke
rise
from
the
creek
;
upon
which
I
*NL*
ordered
the
boat
out
,
taking
Friday
with
me
,
and
hanging
out
a
white
*NL*
flag
of
truce
,
I
went
on
shore
,
accompanied
also
by
the
young
friar
,
to
*NL*
whom
I
had
related
the
history
of
the
first
part
of
my
life
;
besides
we
*NL*
had
sixteen
men
well
armed
,
in
case
we
had
met
with
any
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
rowed
directly
into
the
creek
,
the
first
man
I
fixed
my
eye
*NL*
upon
was
the
Spaniard
,
whose
life
I
had
saved
,
and
whose
face
I
*NL*
perfectly
well
knew
.
I
ordered
them
all
to
stay
in
the
boat
for
a
while
:
*NL*
but
Friday
,
perceiving
his
father
at
a
distance
,
would
have
jumped
into
*NL*
the
sea
,
had
they
not
let
the
boat
go
.
No
sooner
was
he
on
shore
,
but
he
*NL*
flew
like
a
swift
arrow
out
of
a
bow
to
embrace
his
aged
father
.
*NL*
Certainly
it
would
melt
a
man
of
the
firmest
resolution
into
the
softest
*NL*
tears
to
see
with
what
uncommon
transports
of
joy
he
saluted
him
;
he
*NL*
first
kissed
him
,
then
stroked
his
face
,
took
him
in
his
arms
,
laid
him
*NL*
under
a
shady
tree
,
sat
down
by
him
,
then
looked
as
earnestly
at
him
as
*NL*
one
could
do
at
a
picture
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
.
After
this
*NL*
he
would
lie
upon
the
ground
,
stroke
his
legs
and
kiss
them
,
then
get
up
*NL*
and
stare
at
him
,
as
though
he
was
bewitched
;
but
the
next
day
one
could
*NL*
not
forbear
laughter
to
see
his
behaviour
,
for
he
would
walk
several
*NL*
hours
with
his
father
along
the
shore
,
leading
him
by
the
hand
as
tho
'
*NL*
he
was
a
lady
;
while
,
every
now
and
then
,
he
would
run
to
the
boat
to
*NL*
get
something
for
him
,
as
a
lump
of
sugar
,
dram
,
biscuit
,
or
something
*NL*
or
other
that
was
good
.
His
frolics
ran
in
another
channel
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
;
when
he
set
old
Friday
on
the
ground
,
he
would
dance
round
*NL*
him
,
making
comical
postures
and
gestures
;
and
all
this
while
would
be
*NL*
telling
him
one
story
or
another
of
his
travels
and
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
10th
of
April
,
_
anno
_
1695
,
that
I
set
my
foot
upon
the
*NL*
island
a
second
time
.
When
my
faithful
Spaniard
,
accompanied
by
one
*NL*
more
,
approached
the
boat
,
he
little
knew
who
I
was
,
till
I
discovered
*NL*
myself
to
him
.
_
Seignor
_
,
said
I
,
in
Portuguese
,
_
do
n't
you
know
me
_
?
He
*NL*
spoke
never
a
word
,
but
giving
his
musket
to
his
attendant
,
extended
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
saying
something
in
Spanish
that
I
did
not
then
understand
,
he
*NL*
came
forward
&
embraced
me
,
saying
,
_
he
was
inexcusable
not
to
know
his
*NL*
deliverer
:
who
,
like
an
angel
sent
from
heaven
,
had
saved
his
life
_
;
He
*NL*
then
beckoned
to
the
man
to
call
out
his
companions
,
asking
me
if
I
*NL*
would
walk
to
my
own
habitation
and
take
possession
,
where
I
should
find
*NL*
some
mean
improvements
;
but
indeed
they
were
extraordinary
ones
:
for
*NL*
they
had
planted
so
many
trees
so
close
together
,
that
the
place
was
*NL*
like
a
labyrinth
,
which
none
could
find
out
except
themselves
,
who
knew
*NL*
its
intricate
windings
.
I
asked
him
the
meaning
of
all
these
*NL*
fortifications
?
he
told
me
_
he
would
give
a
large
account
of
what
had
*NL*
passed
since
my
departure
till
this
time
,
and
how
he
had
subdued
some
*NL*
English
,
who
thought
to
be
their
murderers
,
hoping
I
would
not
be
*NL*
displeased
,
since
necessity
compelled
them
to
it
_
.
As
I
knew
they
were
*NL*
wicked
villains
,
so
I
told
him
,
that
I
was
not
only
far
from
finding
*NL*
fault
with
it
,
but
was
rather
heartily
glad
that
they
had
subdued
them
.
*NL*
While
we
were
thus
talking
,
the
man
whom
he
sent
returned
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
eleven
more
,
but
in
such
habits
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
*NL*
nations
they
were
of
.
He
first
turned
to
me
,
and
pointing
to
them
,
*NL*
_
These
Sir
,
_
said
he
,
_
are
some
of
the
gentlemen
who
owe
their
lives
to
*NL*
your
goodness
_
,
then
turning
to
them
,
and
pointing
to
me
,
he
made
them
*NL*
sensible
who
I
was
;
and
,
then
indeed
they
saluted
me
one
by
one
,
not
as
*NL*
ordinary
men
,
but
as
tho
'
they
had
been
ambassadors
or
noblemen
,
and
I
a
*NL*
triumphant
conqueror
;
for
their
behaviour
not
only
agreed
with
a
*NL*
manlike
,
majestic
gravity
,
but
at
the
same
time
was
so
obliging
and
*NL*
courteous
,
as
made
them
agreeable
to
the
last
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
relate
the
history
of
the
transactions
of
my
kingdom
,
as
I
had
*NL*
it
from
the
Spaniard
's
own
mouth
,
I
must
here
insert
what
I
omitted
in
*NL*
my
former
relation
.
The
matter
is
this
:
Just
before
we
weighed
anchor
*NL*
and
set
sail
,
there
happened
a
quarrel
on
board
the
ship
,
which
had
like
*NL*
to
have
occasioned
a
second
mutiny
,
till
such
time
the
courageous
*NL*
Capitan
,
taking
two
of
the
most
refractory
prisoners
,
laid
them
in
irons
*NL*
threatening
,
as
they
were
concerned
in
the
former
disorders
,
so
have
*NL*
them
hanged
in
England
for
running
away
with
the
ship
.
This
frightened
*NL*
some
of
the
rest
,
as
thinking
the
Captain
would
serve
them
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
,
though
he
seemed
to
give
them
good
word
for
the
present
.
But
the
*NL*
mate
having
intelligence
of
this
,
mad
me
acquainted
with
their
fears
;
so
*NL*
that
to
make
them
more
easy
,
and
ourselves
more
safe
from
their
*NL*
conspiracies
I
was
obliged
to
go
down
,
and
pass
my
honour
's
word
for
it
,
*NL*
that
upon
their
good
behaviour
,
all
that
was
past
should
be
forgiven
;
in
*NL*
testimony
of
which
,
I
ordered
the
two
men
's
irons
to
be
taken
off
;
&
*NL*
themselves
forgiven
.
But
as
this
had
brought
us
to
an
anchor
that
night
,
*NL*
in
which
there
was
a
calm
;
the
two
men
that
had
been
in
irons
stole
each
*NL*
of
them
a
musket
,
and
some
other
weapons
,
and
taking
the
ship
's
pinnace
,
*NL*
not
yet
hauled
up
,
ran
away
to
their
brother
rogues
.
The
next
morning
we
*NL*
sent
the
long-boat
with
men
to
pursue
them
,
but
all
in
vain
;
the
mate
,
*NL*
in
revenge
,
would
have
demolished
my
little
castle
,
burnt
his
furniture
*NL*
and
destroyed
their
plantations
,
but
having
no
orders
for
it
,
he
did
not
*NL*
put
it
in
execution
.
And
thus
there
were
five
Englishmen
in
the
island
,
*NL*
which
caused
great
differences
,
as
my
faithful
Spaniard
gave
me
a
*NL*
perfect
account
of
,
in
the
following
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
You
can
not
,
Sir
,
but
remember
the
embassy
you
sent
me
about
,
and
what
a
*NL*
disappointment
we
met
with
,
by
your
absence
,
at
our
return
.
There
is
but
*NL*
little
variety
in
the
relation
of
all
our
voyage
,
being
blessed
with
*NL*
calm
weather
and
a
smooth
sea
.
Great
indeed
was
the
joy
of
my
countrymen
*NL*
to
see
me
alive
,
having
acted
as
the
principal
man
on
board
,
the
captain
*NL*
of
the
shipwrecked
vessel
dying
before
;
nor
was
their
surprise
less
,
as
*NL*
knowing
I
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
savages
of
another
nation
,
they
had
*NL*
thought
me
long
since
entombed
in
their
monstrous
bowels
.
But
when
I
*NL*
showed
them
the
arms
,
ammunition
,
and
provisions
I
had
brought
for
them
,
*NL*
they
looked
upon
me
as
a
second
Joseph
advanced
in
Pharoah
's
court
,
and
*NL*
immediately
prepared
to
come
along
with
me
.
Indeed
they
were
obliged
to
*NL*
trespass
upon
their
friendly
savages
,
by
borrowing
two
of
their
canoes
,
*NL*
under
a
pretext
for
fishing
;
and
they
came
away
the
next
morning
,
but
*NL*
without
any
provisions
of
their
own
,
except
a
few
roots
which
served
*NL*
them
instead
of
bread
.
After
three
weeks
absence
we
arrived
at
our
*NL*
habitation
.
Here
we
met
with
three
English
sailors
,
who
,
I
confess
,
gave
*NL*
us
provisions
,
and
that
letter
of
direction
you
had
left
for
us
,
which
*NL*
informed
us
how
to
bring
up
tame
goats
,
plant
corn
,
cure
grapes
,
make
*NL*
pots
,
and
,
in
short
,
every
thing
that
was
necessary
for
our
life
.
As
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
I
knew
your
method
best
,
so
taking
Friday
's
father
to
assist
*NL*
me
,
we
managed
all
the
affairs
;
nor
were
the
rest
of
the
Spaniards
*NL*
wanting
in
their
kind
offices
,
dressing
food
for
the
Englishmen
,
who
did
*NL*
nothing
but
ramble
and
divert
themselves
in
the
woods
,
either
shooting
*NL*
parrots
,
or
catching
tortoises
.
But
we
had
not
been
long
ashore
,
before
*NL*
we
were
informed
of
two
more
Englishmen
,
unnaturally
turned
out
of
their
*NL*
common
place
of
residence
,
by
the
three
others
above
mentioned
;
this
*NL*
made
my
Spaniards
and
me
-LRB-
whom
they
now
looked
upon
as
their
governor
in
*NL*
your
absence
-RRB-
endeavour
to
persuade
them
to
take
them
in
,
that
we
might
*NL*
be
as
one
family
;
but
all
our
intreaties
were
in
vain
,
so
that
the
poor
*NL*
fellows
finding
nothing
to
be
done
without
industry
,
pitched
their
tents
*NL*
on
the
north
side
of
the
island
,
a
little
inclining
to
the
west
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
savages
.
Here
they
built
two
huts
,
one
to
lodge
,
and
the
other
*NL*
to
lay
their
stores
in
;
for
my
good
natured
Spaniards
giving
them
some
*NL*
seeds
,
they
dug
and
planted
as
I
had
done
,
and
began
to
live
prettily
.
*NL*
But
while
they
were
thus
comfortably
going
on
,
the
three
unnatural
*NL*
brutes
,
their
countrymen
,
in
a
mere
bullying
humour
,
insulted
them
by
*NL*
saying
,
`
the
governor
-LRB-
meaning
you
-RRB-
had
given
them
a
possession
of
the
*NL*
island
,
and
d-mn
'em
they
should
build
no
houses
upon
their
ground
,
*NL*
without
paying
rent
.
'
The
two
honest
men
-LRB-
for
so
let
me
now
distinguish
*NL*
them
-RRB-
thought
their
three
countrymen
only
jested
,
and
one
of
them
*NL*
invited
them
in
,
to
see
their
fine
habitations
;
while
the
other
*NL*
facetiously
told
them
`
that
since
they
built
tenements
with
great
*NL*
improvements
,
they
should
,
according
to
the
custom
of
lords
,
give
them
*NL*
a
longer
lease
;
'
at
the
same
time
desiring
them
to
fetch
a
scriviner
to
*NL*
draw
the
writings
.
One
of
these
wretches
swearing
_
he
should
pay
for
the
*NL*
jest
_
,
snatches
up
a
fire
brand
,
and
clapping
it
to
the
outside
of
their
*NL*
hut
,
very
fairly
set
it
on
fire
,
which
would
soon
have
consumed
it
,
had
*NL*
not
the
honest
man
thrust
him
away
,
and
trod
it
with
his
feet
.
Hereupon
*NL*
the
fellow
returns
with
his
pole
,
with
which
he
would
have
ended
his
*NL*
days
,
had
not
the
poor
man
avoided
the
blow
when
fetching
his
musket
,
he
*NL*
knocked
down
the
villain
that
began
the
quarrel
.
The
other
two
coming
to
*NL*
assist
their
fellow
,
obliged
the
honest
man
to
take
his
musket
also
,
and
*NL*
both
of
them
presenting
their
pieces
bid
the
villains
stand
off
;
and
if
*NL*
they
did
not
lay
down
their
arms
,
death
should
decide
the
dispute
one
*NL*
way
or
other
.
This
brought
them
to
a
parley
,
in
which
they
agreed
to
*NL*
take
their
wounded
man
and
begone
;
but
they
were
in
the
wrong
that
they
*NL*
did
not
disarm
them
when
they
had
the
power
,
and
then
make
their
*NL*
complaint
to
me
and
my
Spaniards
for
justice
,
which
might
have
prevented
*NL*
their
farther
designs
against
them
.
And
indeed
so
many
trespass
did
they
*NL*
afterwards
commit
,
by
treading
down
their
corn
,
shooting
their
young
*NL*
kids
and
goats
,
and
plaguing
them
night
and
day
,
that
they
resolved
to
*NL*
come
to
my
castle
,
challenge
all
the
three
,
and
decide
their
right
by
*NL*
one
plain
battle
,
while
the
Spaniards
stood
by
to
see
fair
play
.
One
day
*NL*
it
happened
,
that
two
of
my
Spaniards
-LRB-
one
of
whom
understood
English
-RRB-
*NL*
being
in
the
woods
,
were
met
by
one
of
the
honest
men
,
who
complained
*NL*
how
barbarous
their
countrymen
had
been
in
destroying
their
corn
,
*NL*
killing
their
milk-goat
and
three
kids
,
which
deprived
them
of
their
*NL*
subsistence
;
and
that
if
we
did
not
grant
them
relief
,
they
must
be
*NL*
inevitably
starved
,
and
so
they
parted
;
but
when
my
Spaniards
came
home
*NL*
at
night
,
and
supper
being
on
the
table
,
one
of
them
began
to
reprehend
*NL*
the
Englishmen
,
but
in
a
very
mannerly
way
;
which
they
resenting
,
*NL*
replied
,
_
What
business
had
their
countrymen
in
that
place
without
*NL*
leave
,
when
it
was
none
of
their
ground
?
Why
_
,
said
my
Spaniard
,
calmly
,
*NL*
_
Inglise
,
they
must
not
starve
:
_
but
they
replied
,
_
Let
them
starve
and
*NL*
be
damn
'd
,
they
should
neither
plant
nor
build
,
and
damn
them
,
they
*NL*
should
be
their
servants
,
and
work
for
them
,
for
the
island
was
their
's
,
*NL*
and
they
would
burn
all
the
huts
they
should
find
in
the
island
.
By
this
*NL*
rule
_
,
said
my
Spaniard
,
smiling
,
_
We
shall
be
your
servants
too
.
Aye
,
*NL*
by
God
,
and
so
you
shall
_
replied
the
impudent
rascal
.
Upon
which
,
*NL*
starting
up
,
Will
Atkins
cries
,
_
Come
Jack
,
let
's
have
t
`
other
brush
*NL*
with
them
;
who
dare
to
build
in
our
dominions
?
_
--
Thus
leaving
us
*NL*
something
heated
with
just
passion
,
away
they
trooped
,
every
man
having
*NL*
a
gun
,
pistol
,
and
sword
,
muttering
some
threatening
words
,
that
we
*NL*
could
then
but
imperfectly
understand
.
That
night
they
designed
to
*NL*
murder
their
two
companions
,
and
slept
till
midnight
in
the
bower
,
*NL*
thinking
to
fall
upon
them
in
their
sleep
:
not
were
the
honest
men
less
*NL*
thoughtful
concerning
them
;
for
at
this
juncture
they
were
coming
to
*NL*
find
them
out
,
but
in
a
much
fairer
way
.
As
soon
as
the
villains
came
to
*NL*
the
huts
,
and
found
nobody
there
,
they
concluded
that
I
and
my
Spaniard
*NL*
had
given
them
notice
,
and
therefore
swore
to
be
revenged
on
us
.
Then
*NL*
they
demolished
the
poor
men
's
habitations
;
not
by
fire
,
as
they
*NL*
attempted
before
,
but
pulled
down
their
houses
,
limb
from
limb
,
not
*NL*
leaving
stick
nor
stone
on
the
ground
where
they
stood
,
broke
their
*NL*
household
stuff
in
pieces
,
tore
up
their
trees
,
spoiled
their
*NL*
inclosures
,
and
,
in
short
,
quite
ruined
them
of
every
thing
they
had
.
*NL*
Had
these
people
met
together
,
no
doubt
but
there
would
have
been
a
*NL*
bloody
battle
;
but
Providence
ordered
it
for
the
better
;
for
just
as
the
*NL*
three
were
got
together
the
two
were
at
our
castle
;
and
when
they
left
*NL*
us
,
the
three
came
back
again
,
but
in
great
rage
,
scoffingly
telling
us
*NL*
what
they
had
done
;
when
one
taking
hold
of
a
Spaniard
's
hat
,
twirls
it
*NL*
round
,
saying
,
_
And
you
Seignor
Jack
Spaniard
,
shall
have
the
same
*NL*
sauce
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
your
manners
_
.
My
Spaniard
,
a
grave
but
*NL*
courageous
man
,
knocked
him
down
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
;
at
which
*NL*
another
villain
fired
his
pistol
,
and
narrowly
missed
his
body
,
but
*NL*
wounded
him
a
little
in
the
ear
.
Hereat
enraged
,
the
Spaniard
takes
up
*NL*
the
fellow
's
musket
who
he
had
knocked
down
,
and
would
have
shot
him
,
if
*NL*
I
and
the
rest
had
not
come
out
,
and
taken
their
arms
from
every
one
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
Englishmen
perceiving
they
had
made
all
of
us
their
enemies
,
*NL*
began
to
cool
;
but
not
withstanding
their
better
words
the
Spaniards
*NL*
would
not
return
them
their
arms
again
,
telling
them
,
`
they
would
do
*NL*
them
no
manner
of
harm
,
if
they
would
live
peaceably
;
but
if
they
*NL*
offered
any
injury
to
the
plantation
or
castle
,
they
would
shoot
them
as
*NL*
they
would
do
ravenous
beasts
.
This
made
them
so
mad
,
that
they
went
*NL*
away
raging
like
furies
of
hell
.
They
were
no
sooner
gone
,
but
in
came
*NL*
the
two
honest
men
,
fired
with
the
justest
rage
,
if
such
can
be
,
having
*NL*
been
ruined
as
aforesaid
.
And
indeed
it
was
very
hard
,
that
nineteen
of
*NL*
us
should
be
bullied
by
three
villains
,
continually
offending
*NL*
with
impunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
great
while
,
Sir
,
before
we
could
persuade
the
two
Englishmen
*NL*
from
pursuing
,
and
undoubtedly
killing
them
with
their
fire-arms
;
but
we
*NL*
promised
them
`
justice
should
be
done
them
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
they
*NL*
should
reside
with
us
in
our
habitation
.
'
In
about
five
days
after
,
*NL*
these
three
vagrants
,
almost
starved
with
hunger
,
drew
near
our
grove
,
*NL*
and
perceiving
me
,
the
governor
,
&
two
others
walking
by
the
side
of
the
*NL*
creek
,
they
very
submissively
desired
to
be
received
into
the
family
*NL*
again
.
We
told
them
of
`
their
great
incivility
to
us
,
and
of
their
*NL*
unnatural
barbarity
to
their
countrymen
;
but
yet
we
would
see
what
the
*NL*
rest
agreed
to
,
and
in
half
an
hour
's
time
would
bring
them
word
.
'
*NL*
After
some
debate
,
we
called
them
in
,
where
their
two
countrymen
laid
a
*NL*
heavy
charge
against
them
,
for
not
only
ruining
,
but
designing
to
murder
*NL*
them
,
which
they
could
not
deny
.
But
here
I
was
forced
to
interpose
as
a
*NL*
mediator
,
by
obliging
the
two
Englishmen
not
to
hurt
them
,
being
naked
&
*NL*
unarmed
,
and
that
the
other
three
should
make
them
restitution
,
by
*NL*
building
their
two
huts
,
and
fencing
their
ground
in
the
same
manner
as
*NL*
it
was
before
.
Well
,
being
in
a
miserable
condition
,
they
submitted
to
*NL*
this
at
present
,
and
lived
some
time
regularly
enough
,
except
as
to
the
*NL*
working
part
,
which
they
did
not
care
for
,
but
the
Spaniards
would
have
*NL*
dispensed
with
that
,
had
they
continued
easy
and
quiet
.
Their
arms
being
*NL*
given
them
again
,
they
scarce
had
them
a
week
when
they
became
as
*NL*
troublesome
as
ever
;
but
an
accident
happening
soon
after
,
obliged
us
to
*NL*
lay
aside
private
resentments
,
and
look
to
our
common
preservation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
,
Sir
,
I
went
to
bed
,
perfectly
well
in
health
,
and
yet
by
no
*NL*
means
could
I
compose
myself
to
sleep
;
upon
which
,
being
very
uneasy
,
I
*NL*
got
up
and
looked
out
,
but
it
being
dark
,
I
could
perceive
nothing
but
*NL*
the
trees
around
the
castle
.
I
went
to
bed
again
,
but
it
was
all
one
,
I
*NL*
could
not
sleep
;
when
one
of
my
Spaniards
,
hearing
me
walk
about
,
asked
*NL*
who
it
was
up
?
I
answered
,
_
It
is
I
_
.
When
I
told
him
the
occasion
,
*NL*
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
such
things
are
not
to
be
slighted
;
for
certainly
there
*NL*
is
some
mischief
plotting
against
us
.
Where
are
the
Englishmen
?
_
said
I
.
*NL*
He
answered
_
In
their
huts
_
;
for
they
lay
separate
from
us
,
Sir
,
since
*NL*
the
last
mutiny
.
_
Well
,
_
said
I
,
_
some
kind
spirit
gives
this
*NL*
information
for
advantage
.
Come
let
us
go
abroad
,
and
see
if
any
thing
*NL*
offers
to
justify
our
fears
.
_
Upon
which
I
and
some
of
my
Spaniards
went
*NL*
up
the
mountain
,
not
by
the
ladder
,
but
through
the
grove
,
and
then
we
*NL*
were
struck
with
a
panic
fear
on
seeing
a
light
,
as
though
it
were
a
*NL*
fire
,
at
a
very
little
distance
,
and
hearing
the
voices
of
several
men
.
*NL*
Hereupon
we
retreated
immediately
,
and
raised
the
rest
of
our
forces
,
*NL*
and
made
them
sensible
of
the
impending
danger
;
but
with
all
my
*NL*
authority
,
I
could
not
make
them
stay
where
they
were
,
so
earnest
were
*NL*
they
to
see
how
things
went
.
Indeed
the
darkness
of
the
night
gave
them
*NL*
opportunity
enough
to
view
them
by
the
light
of
the
fire
undiscovered
.
*NL*
As
they
were
in
different
parties
,
and
straggling
over
the
shore
,
we
*NL*
were
much
afraid
that
they
should
find
out
our
habitations
,
and
destroy
*NL*
our
flocks
of
goats
:
to
prevent
which
,
we
sent
immediately
an
Englishman
*NL*
and
two
Spaniards
to
drive
the
goats
into
the
valley
where
the
cave
lay
;
*NL*
or
,
if
there
was
occasion
,
into
the
cave
itself
:
As
to
ourselves
,
*NL*
resuming
our
native
courage
and
prudent
conduct
,
had
we
not
been
*NL*
divided
,
we
durst
venture
to
attack
an
hundred
of
them
;
but
before
it
*NL*
was
very
light
,
we
resolved
to
send
out
Friday
's
father
as
a
spy
,
who
,
*NL*
immediately
stripping
himself
naked
,
gets
among
them
undiscovered
,
and
*NL*
in
two
hours
time
brings
word
,
that
`
they
were
two
parties
of
two
*NL*
different
nations
,
who
lately
having
a
bloody
battle
with
one
another
,
*NL*
happened
to
land
by
mere
chance
on
the
same
island
,
to
devour
their
*NL*
miserable
prisoners
;
that
they
were
entirely
ignorant
of
any
person
's
*NL*
inhabiting
here
;
but
rather
filled
with
rage
and
fury
against
one
*NL*
another
,
he
believed
,
that
as
soon
as
day
light
appeared
,
there
would
be
*NL*
a
terrible
engagement
.
'
Old
Friday
had
scarce
ended
his
relation
,
when
*NL*
we
heard
an
uncommon
noise
,
and
perceived
that
there
was
a
horrid
*NL*
engagement
between
the
two
armies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
was
the
curiosity
of
our
party
,
especially
the
Englishmen
,
that
*NL*
they
would
not
lie
close
,
tho
'
Old
Friday
told
them
,
`
their
safety
*NL*
depended
upon
it
;
and
that
if
we
had
patience
,
we
should
behold
the
*NL*
savages
kill
one
another
.
'
However
they
used
some
caution
,
by
going
*NL*
farther
into
the
woods
,
and
placing
themselves
in
a
convenient
place
to
*NL*
behold
the
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
could
there
be
a
more
bloody
engagement
,
or
men
of
more
*NL*
invincible
spirits
and
prudent
conduct
,
according
to
their
manner
and
*NL*
way
of
fighting
.
It
lasted
near
two
hours
,
till
the
party
which
was
*NL*
nearest
our
castle
began
to
decline
,
and
at
last
to
fly
from
their
*NL*
conquerors
.
We
were
undoubtedly
put
into
a
great
consternation
on
this
*NL*
account
,
lest
they
should
run
into
our
grove
,
and
consequently
bring
us
*NL*
into
the
like
danger
.
Hereupon
we
resolved
to
kill
the
first
that
came
,
*NL*
to
prevent
discovery
,
and
that
too
with
our
swords
,
and
the
butt
end
of
*NL*
our
muskets
,
for
fear
the
report
of
our
guns
should
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
indeed
,
as
we
thought
,
it
happened
;
for
three
of
the
vanquished
*NL*
army
crossing
the
creek
,
ran
directly
to
the
place
,
as
to
a
thick
wood
*NL*
for
shelter
;
nor
was
it
long
before
our
scout
gave
us
notice
of
it
:
as
*NL*
also
,
that
the
victors
did
not
think
fit
to
pursue
them
.
Upon
this
I
*NL*
would
not
suffer
them
to
be
slain
,
but
had
them
surprised
and
taken
by
*NL*
our
party
;
afterwards
they
proved
very
good
servants
to
us
,
being
stout
*NL*
young
creatures
,
and
able
to
do
a
great
deal
of
work
.
The
remainder
of
*NL*
the
conquered
savages
fled
to
their
canoes
,
and
put
out
into
the
ocean
,
*NL*
while
the
conquerors
,
joining
together
,
shouted
by
way
of
triumph
,
and
*NL*
about
three
in
the
afternoon
they
also
embarked
for
their
own
nation
.
*NL*
Thus
we
were
freed
at
once
from
these
savages
and
our
fears
,
not
*NL*
perceiving
any
of
these
creatures
for
some
considerable
time
after
.
We
*NL*
found
two
and
thirty
men
dead
in
the
field
of
battle
;
some
were
slain
*NL*
with
long
arrows
,
which
we
found
sticking
in
their
bodies
;
&
the
rest
*NL*
were
killed
with
great
unwieldy
wooden
swords
,
which
denoted
their
vast
*NL*
strength
,
and
of
which
we
found
seventeen
,
besides
bows
and
arrows
:
but
*NL*
we
could
not
find
one
wounded
creature
among
them
alive
;
for
they
either
*NL*
kill
their
enemies
quite
,
or
carry
those
wounded
away
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
terrible
fight
tamed
the
Englishmen
for
some
time
,
considering
*NL*
how
unfortunate
they
might
have
been
had
they
fallen
into
their
hands
,
*NL*
who
would
not
only
kill
them
as
enemies
,
but
also
for
food
,
as
we
do
*NL*
cattle
;
and
indeed
so
much
did
this
nauseate
their
stomachs
,
that
it
not
*NL*
only
made
them
very
sick
,
but
more
tractable
to
the
common
necessary
*NL*
business
of
the
whole
society
,
planting
,
sowing
,
and
reaping
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
signs
of
amity
and
friendship
;
so
,
that
being
now
all
good
*NL*
friends
,
we
began
to
consider
of
circumstances
in
general
;
and
the
first
*NL*
thing
we
thought
of
was
,
whether
,
as
we
perceived
the
savages
haunted
*NL*
that
side
of
the
island
,
and
there
being
more
retired
parts
of
it
,
and
*NL*
yet
as
well
suited
to
our
manner
of
living
,
and
equally
to
our
*NL*
advantage
,
we
ought
not
rather
to
move
our
place
of
residence
,
&
plant
*NL*
it
in
a
much
safer
place
,
both
for
the
security
of
our
corn
and
cattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
a
long
debate
on
this
head
;
it
was
resolved
,
or
rather
voted
,
*NL*
_
nemine
comradicente
_
,
not
to
remove
our
ancient
castle
,
and
that
for
*NL*
this
very
good
reason
,
that
some
time
or
other
we
expected
to
hear
from
*NL*
our
supreme
governor
,
-LRB-
meaning
you
,
Sir
-RRB-
whose
messengers
not
finding
us
*NL*
there
,
might
think
the
place
demolished
,
and
all
his
subjects
destroyed
*NL*
by
the
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
next
concern
relating
to
our
corn
and
cattle
,
we
consented
to
*NL*
have
them
removed
to
the
valley
where
the
cave
was
,
that
being
most
*NL*
proper
and
sufficient
for
both
.
But
yet
when
we
considered
farther
,
we
*NL*
altered
one
part
of
our
resolution
,
which
was
to
remove
part
of
our
*NL*
cattle
thither
and
plant
only
part
of
our
corn
there
;
so
that
in
case
*NL*
one
part
was
destroyed
,
the
other
might
be
preserved
.
Another
resolution
*NL*
we
took
,
which
really
had
a
great
deal
of
prudence
in
it
;
and
that
was
,
*NL*
in
not
trusting
the
three
savages
whom
we
had
taken
prisoners
,
with
any
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
plantations
we
had
made
in
the
valley
,
of
what
number
*NL*
of
cattle
we
had
there
,
much
less
of
the
cave
,
wherein
we
kept
several
*NL*
arms
,
and
two
barrels
of
powder
you
left
for
us
at
your
departure
from
*NL*
this
island
.
But
though
we
could
not
change
our
habitation
,
we
resolved
*NL*
to
make
it
more
fortified
and
more
secret
.
To
this
end
,
Sir
,
as
you
*NL*
planted
trees
at
some
distance
before
the
entrance
of
your
palace
;
so
*NL*
we
,
imitating
your
example
,
planted
and
filled
up
the
whole
space
of
*NL*
ground
,
even
to
the
banks
of
the
creek
,
nay
,
into
the
very
ooze
where
*NL*
the
tide
flowed
,
not
leaving
a
place
for
landing
;
and
among
those
I
had
*NL*
planted
,
they
had
intermingled
so
many
short
ones
,
all
of
which
growing
*NL*
wonderfully
fast
and
thick
,
a
little
dog
could
scarcely
find
a
passage
*NL*
through
them
.
Nor
was
this
sufficient
,
as
we
thought
,
for
we
did
the
*NL*
same
to
all
the
ground
,
on
the
right
and
left
hand
of
us
,
even
to
the
*NL*
top
of
the
hill
,
without
so
much
as
leaving
a
passage
for
ourselves
,
*NL*
except
by
the
ladder
;
which
being
taken
down
,
nothing
but
what
had
*NL*
wings
or
witchcraft
could
pretend
to
come
near
us
.
And
indeed
this
was
*NL*
exceedingly
well-contrived
,
especially
to
serve
that
occasion
for
which
*NL*
we
afterwards
found
it
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
we
lived
two
years
in
a
happy
retirement
,
having
,
all
this
time
,
*NL*
not
one
visit
from
the
savages
.
Indeed
one
morning
we
had
an
alarm
,
*NL*
which
put
us
in
some
amazement
;
for
a
few
of
my
Spaniards
being
out
very
*NL*
early
,
perceived
no
less
than
twenty
canoes
,
as
it
were
coming
on
shore
:
*NL*
upon
which
returning
home
,
with
great
precipitation
,
they
gave
us
the
*NL*
alarm
,
which
obliged
us
to
keep
at
home
all
that
day
and
the
next
,
going
*NL*
out
only
in
the
night-time
to
make
our
observations
;
but
,
as
good
luck
*NL*
would
have
it
,
they
were
upon
another
design
,
and
did
not
land
that
time
*NL*
upon
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
there
happened
another
quarrel
between
the
three
wicked
*NL*
Englishmen
,
and
some
of
my
Spaniards
.
--
The
occasion
was
this
:
One
of
*NL*
them
being
enraged
at
one
of
the
savages
,
whom
he
had
taken
prisoner
,
*NL*
for
not
being
able
to
comprehend
something
which
he
was
showing
him
,
*NL*
snatched
up
a
hatchet
in
a
great
fury
not
to
correct
,
but
to
kill
him
;
*NL*
yet
missing
his
head
gave
him
such
a
barbarous
--
cut
in
the
shoulder
,
*NL*
that
he
had
like
to
have
struck
off
his
arm
;
at
which
one
of
my
*NL*
good-natured
Spaniards
interposing
between
the
Englishman
and
the
savage
*NL*
beseeched
the
former
,
not
to
murder
the
poor
creature
,
but
this
kindness
*NL*
had
like
to
have
cost
the
Spaniard
his
life
,
for
the
Englishman
,
struck
*NL*
at
him
in
the
same
manner
;
which
he
nimbly
and
wisely
avoiding
,
returned
*NL*
suddenly
upon
him
with
his
shovel
,
-LRB-
being
all
at
work
about
their
corn
*NL*
land
-RRB-
,
and
very
fairly
knocked
the
brutish
creature
down
.
Hereupon
*NL*
another
Englishman
coming
to
his
fellow
's
assistance
,
laid
the
good
*NL*
Spaniard
on
the
earth
;
when
immediately
two
others
coming
to
his
relief
*NL*
were
attacked
by
the
third
Englishman
,
armed
with
an
old
cutlass
,
who
*NL*
wounded
them
both
.
This
uproar
soon
reached
our
ears
,
when
we
rushing
*NL*
out
upon
them
,
took
the
three
Englishmen
prisoners
,
and
then
our
next
*NL*
question
was
,
what
would
be
done
to
such
mutinous
,
and
impudent
fellows
,
*NL*
so
furious
,
desperate
,
and
idle
,
that
they
were
mischievious
to
the
*NL*
highest
degree
and
consequently
not
safe
for
the
society
to
let
them
*NL*
live
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Sir
,
as
I
was
governor
in
your
absence
,
so
I
also
took
the
*NL*
authority
of
a
judge
,
and
,
having
them
brought
before
me
;
I
told
them
,
*NL*
that
if
they
had
been
of
my
country
,
I
would
have
hanged
every
mother
's
*NL*
son
of
them
,
but
since
it
was
an
Englishman
-LRB-
meaning
you
,
kind
Sir
,
-RRB-
to
*NL*
whom
we
were
indebted
for
our
preservation
and
deliverance
,
I
would
,
in
*NL*
gratitude
,
use
them
with
all
possible
mildness
,
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
leave
them
to
the
judgment
of
the
other
two
Englishmen
who
,
I
hoped
,
*NL*
forgetting
their
resentments
,
would
deal
impartially
by
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hereupon
one
of
his
countrymen
stood
up
:
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
leave
it
not
*NL*
for
us
,
for
you
may
be
sensible
we
have
reason
to
sentence
them
to
the
*NL*
gallows
:
besides
,
Sir
,
this
fellow
,
Will
Atkins
,
and
the
two
others
,
*NL*
proposed
to
us
,
that
we
might
murder
you
all
in
your
sleep
,
which
we
*NL*
could
not
consent
to
:
but
knowing
their
inability
,
and
your
vigilance
,
*NL*
we
did
not
think
fit
to
discover
it
before
now
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
How
,
Signor
_
,
said
I
,
_
do
you
hear
what
is
alledged
against
you
?
What
*NL*
can
you
say
to
justify
so
horrid
an
action
,
as
to
murder
us
in
cold
*NL*
blood
?
_
So
far
,
Sir
,
was
the
wretch
from
denying
it
,
that
he
swore
,
*NL*
_
damn
him
but
he
would
do
it
still
.
But
what
have
we
done
to
you
,
Seignor
*NL*
Atkins
_
,
said
I
,
_
or
what
will
you
gain
by
killing
us
?
What
shall
we
do
*NL*
to
prevent
you
?
Must
we
kill
you
,
or
you
kill
us
?
Why
will
you
Seignor
*NL*
Atkins
,
_
said
I
,
smiling
,
_
put
us
to
such
an
unhappy
dilemma
,
such
a
*NL*
fatal
necessity
?
_
But
so
great
a
rage
did
my
scoffing
and
yet
severe
*NL*
jest
put
him
into
,
that
he
was
going
to
fly
at
me
and
undoubtedly
had
*NL*
attempted
to
kill
me
if
he
had
been
possessed
of
weapons
,
and
had
not
*NL*
been
prevented
by
three
Spaniards
.
This
unparalleled
and
villainous
*NL*
carriage
,
made
us
seriously
consider
what
was
to
be
done
.
The
two
*NL*
Englishmen
and
the
Spaniard
,
who
had
saved
the
poor
Indian
's
life
,
*NL*
mightily
petitioned
me
to
hang
one
of
them
,
for
an
example
to
the
*NL*
others
,
which
should
be
him
that
had
twice
attempted
to
commit
murder
*NL*
with
his
hatchet
,
it
being
at
that
time
thought
impossible
the
poor
*NL*
slave
should
recover
.
But
they
could
never
gain
my
consent
to
put
him
to
*NL*
death
,
for
the
reasons
above
mentioned
,
since
it
was
an
Englishman
-LRB-
even
*NL*
yourself
-RRB-
who
was
my
deliverer
;
and
as
merciful
counsels
are
most
*NL*
prevailing
when
earnestly
pressed
,
so
I
got
them
to
be
of
the
same
*NL*
opinion
as
to
clemency
.
But
to
prevent
them
doing
us
any
farther
*NL*
mischief
;
we
all
agreed
,
that
they
should
have
no
weapons
,
as
sword
,
*NL*
gun
,
powder
,
or
shot
,
but
be
expelled
from
the
society
,
to
live
as
they
*NL*
pleased
by
themselves
;
that
neither
the
two
Englishmen
,
nor
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
Spaniards
,
should
have
conversation
with
them
upon
any
account
*NL*
whatsoever
;
that
they
should
be
kept
from
coming
within
a
certain
*NL*
distance
of
our
castle
;
and
if
they
dared
to
offer
us
any
violence
,
*NL*
either
by
spoiling
,
burning
,
killing
,
or
destroying
any
of
the
corn
,
*NL*
plantings
,
buildings
,
fences
,
or
cattle
,
belonging
to
the
society
,
we
*NL*
would
shoot
them
as
freely
as
we
would
do
beasts
of
prey
,
in
whatsoever
*NL*
places
we
should
find
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
sentence
seemed
very
just
to
all
but
themselves
;
when
,
like
a
*NL*
merciful
judge
,
I
called
out
to
the
two
honest
Englishmen
,
saying
,
_
You
*NL*
must
consider
they
ought
not
to
be
starved
neither
:
and
since
it
will
be
*NL*
some
time
before
they
can
raise
corn
and
cattle
of
their
own
,
let
us
*NL*
give
them
some
corn
to
last
them
eight
months
,
and
for
seed
to
sow
,
by
*NL*
which
time
they
'll
raise
some
for
themselves
;
let
us
also
bestow
upon
*NL*
them
six
milch
goats
,
four
he
ones
,
and
six
kids
,
as
well
for
their
*NL*
present
support
,
as
for
a
further
increase
;
with
tools
necessary
for
*NL*
their
work
,
as
hatchets
,
an
ax
,
saw
,
and
other
things
convenient
to
*NL*
build
them
huts
:
_
all
which
were
agreed
:
but
before
they
took
them
into
*NL*
possession
,
I
obliged
them
solemnly
to
swear
,
never
to
attempt
any
thing
*NL*
against
us
,
or
their
countrymen
for
the
future
.
Thus
dismissing
them
*NL*
from
our
society
,
They
went
away
,
sullen
&
refractory
,
as
though
neither
*NL*
willing
to
go
nor
stay
;
however
seeing
no
remedy
,
they
took
what
*NL*
provision
was
given
them
,
proposing
to
choose
a
convenient
place
where
*NL*
they
might
live
by
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
five
days
after
,
they
came
to
those
limits
appointed
,
in
order
*NL*
for
more
victuals
,
and
sent
me
word
by
one
of
my
Spaniards
,
whom
they
*NL*
called
to
,
where
they
had
pitched
their
tents
;
and
marked
themselves
out
*NL*
an
habitation
and
plantation
,
at
the
N.E.
and
most
remote
part
of
the
*NL*
island
.
And
,
indeed
,
there
they
built
themselves
two
very
handsome
*NL*
cottages
,
resembling
our
little
castle
,
being
under
the
side
of
a
*NL*
mountain
,
with
some
trees
already
growing
on
three
sides
of
it
;
so
that
*NL*
planting
a
few
more
,
it
would
be
obscured
from
sight
,
unless
*NL*
particularly
sought
for
.
When
these
huts
were
finished
,
we
gave
them
*NL*
some
dry
goat-skins
for
bedding
and
covering
;
&
upon
their
giving
us
*NL*
fuller
assurances
of
their
good
behaviour
for
the
future
,
we
gave
them
*NL*
some
pease
,
barley
,
and
rice
for
sowing
and
whatever
tools
we
*NL*
could
spare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
months
did
they
live
in
this
separate
condition
,
in
which
they
got
*NL*
their
first
harvest
in
,
the
quantity
of
which
was
but
small
,
because
*NL*
they
had
planted
but
little
land
;
for
,
indeed
,
all
their
plantations
*NL*
being
to
form
,
made
it
more
difficult
;
especially
as
it
was
a
thing
out
*NL*
of
their
element
;
and
when
they
were
obliged
to
make
their
boards
and
*NL*
pots
,
&
c.
they
could
make
little
or
nothing
of
it
.
But
the
rainy
season
*NL*
coming
on
,
put
them
into
a
greater
perplexity
for
want
of
a
cave
to
keep
*NL*
their
corn
dry
,
and
prevent
it
from
spoiling
:
and
so
much
did
this
*NL*
humble
them
,
that
they
begged
of
my
Spaniards
to
help
them
,
to
which
the
*NL*
good-natured
men
readily
consented
,
and
in
four
days
space
,
worked
a
*NL*
great
hole
in
the
side
of
the
hill
for
them
,
large
enough
for
their
*NL*
purpose
,
to
secure
their
corn
and
other
things
from
the
rain
,
though
not
*NL*
comparable
to
ours
,
which
had
several
additional
appartments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
a
new
whim
possessed
these
rogues
about
three
quarters
of
a
year
*NL*
after
,
which
had
like
to
have
ruined
us
,
and
themselves
too
:
for
it
*NL*
seems
,
being
tired
and
weary
of
this
sort
of
living
,
which
made
them
*NL*
work
for
themselves
,
without
hopes
of
changing
their
condition
,
nothing
*NL*
would
serve
them
,
but
that
they
would
make
a
voyage
to
the
continent
,
*NL*
and
try
if
they
could
seize
upon
some
of
the
savages
,
and
bring
them
*NL*
over
as
slaves
,
to
do
their
drudgery
,
while
they
lived
at
ease
*NL*
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
the
project
was
not
so
preposterous
,
if
they
had
not
gone
*NL*
farther
;
but
they
neither
did
,
nor
proposed
any
thing
,
but
what
had
*NL*
mischief
in
the
design
,
or
the
event
.
One
morning
,
these
three
fellows
*NL*
came
down
to
the
limited
station
,
and
humbly
desired
to
be
admitted
to
*NL*
talk
with
us
,
which
we
readily
granted
;
they
told
us
in
short
,
that
*NL*
_
being
tired
of
their
manner
of
living
,
and
the
labour
of
their
hands
in
*NL*
such
employments
,
not
being
sufficient
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
*NL*
life
,
they
only
desired
one
of
the
canoes
we
came
over
in
,
with
some
*NL*
arms
and
ammunition
for
their
defence
,
and
they
would
seek
their
*NL*
fortunes
abroad
,
and
never
trouble
us
any
more
.
_
To
be
sure
we
were
glad
*NL*
enough
to
get
rid
of
such
wretched
plagues
;
but
yet
honesty
made
us
*NL*
ingenuously
represent
to
them
,
by
what
we
ourselves
had
suffered
,
the
*NL*
certain
destruction
they
were
running
into
,
either
of
being
starved
to
*NL*
death
or
murdered
by
the
savages
.
To
this
they
very
audaciously
replied
,
*NL*
_
that
they
neither
could
nor
would
work
:
and
consequently
that
they
*NL*
might
as
well
be
starved
abroad
as
at
home
:
&
neither
had
they
any
wives
*NL*
or
children
to
cry
after
them
:
nay
,
so
intent
were
they
upon
their
*NL*
voyage
,
that
if
the
Spaniards
had
not
given
them
arms
,
so
they
had
but
*NL*
the
canoe
they
would
have
gone
without
them
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
we
could
not
well
spare
our
fire
arms
,
rather
than
they
should
*NL*
go
like
naked
men
,
we
let
them
have
two
muskets
,
a
pistol
,
a
cutlass
,
*NL*
and
three
hatchets
,
which
were
thought
very
sufficient
:
we
gave
them
*NL*
also
goat
's
flesh
,
a
great
basket
full
of
dried
grapes
,
a
pot
of
fresh
*NL*
butter
,
a
young
live
kid
,
and
a
large
canoe
sufficient
to
carry
twenty
*NL*
men
.
And
thus
,
with
a
mast
made
of
a
long
pole
,
and
a
sail
of
six
large
*NL*
goat-skins
dried
,
having
a
fair
breeze
,
and
a
flood-tide
with
them
,
they
*NL*
merrily
sailed
away
,
the
Spaniards
calling
after
them
,
_
Bon
voyaje
_
,
no
*NL*
man
ever
expecting
to
see
them
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
were
gone
,
the
Spaniards
and
Englishmen
would
often
say
to
*NL*
one
another
,
_
O
how
peaceably
do
we
now
live
,
since
these
turbulent
*NL*
fellows
have
left
us
!
_
Nothing
could
be
farther
from
their
thoughts
than
*NL*
to
behold
their
faces
any
more
;
and
yet
scarce
two
and
twenty
days
had
*NL*
passed
over
their
heads
,
but
one
of
the
Englishmen
,
being
abroad
a
*NL*
planting
,
perceived
at
a
distance
,
three
men
well
armed
,
approaching
*NL*
towards
him
.
Away
he
flies
with
speed
to
our
castle
,
and
tells
me
and
*NL*
the
rest
,
that
we
were
all
undone
,
for
that
strangers
were
landed
upon
*NL*
the
island
,
and
who
they
were
he
could
not
tell
;
but
added
that
they
*NL*
were
not
savages
but
men
habited
,
bearing
arms
.
_
Why
then
,
_
said
I
,
_
we
*NL*
have
the
less
occasion
to
be
concerned
,
since
,
if
they
were
not
Indians
,
*NL*
they
must
be
friends
;
for
I
am
sure
there
is
no
Christian
people
upon
*NL*
earth
,
but
what
will
do
us
good
rather
than
harm
.
_
But
while
we
were
*NL*
considering
of
the
event
,
up
came
the
three
Englishmen
,
whose
voices
we
*NL*
quickly
knew
,
and
so
all
our
admiration
of
that
nature
ceased
at
once
.
*NL*
And
our
wonder
was
succeeded
by
another
sort
of
inquiry
,
which
was
,
what
*NL*
could
be
the
occasion
of
their
returning
so
quickly
to
the
island
,
when
*NL*
we
little
expected
,
and
much
less
desired
their
company
?
But
as
this
was
*NL*
better
to
be
related
by
themselves
,
I
ordered
them
to
be
brought
in
,
*NL*
when
they
gave
me
the
following
relation
of
their
voyage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
two
days
sail
,
or
something
less
,
they
reached
land
,
where
they
*NL*
found
the
people
coming
to
give
them
another
sort
of
reception
than
what
*NL*
they
expected
or
desired
;
for
,
as
the
savages
were
armed
with
bows
and
*NL*
arrows
,
they
durst
not
venture
on
shore
,
but
steered
northward
,
six
or
*NL*
seven
hours
,
till
they
gained
an
opening
,
by
which
they
plainly
*NL*
perceived
,
that
the
land
that
appeared
from
this
place
,
was
not
the
main
*NL*
land
,
but
an
island
.
At
their
entrance
into
the
opening
of
the
sea
,
they
*NL*
discovered
another
island
,
on
the
right
hand
northward
,
and
several
more
*NL*
lying
to
the
westward
;
but
being
resolved
to
go
on
shore
some
where
or
*NL*
other
,
they
put
over
to
one
of
the
western
islands
.
Here
they
found
the
*NL*
natives
very
courteous
to
them
,
giving
them
several
roots
and
dried
*NL*
fish
;
nay
,
even
their
women
too
were
as
willing
to
supply
them
with
what
*NL*
they
could
procure
them
to
eat
,
bringing
it
a
great
way
to
them
upon
*NL*
their
heads
.
Among
these
hospitable
Indians
they
continued
some
days
,
*NL*
inquiring
by
signs
and
tokens
,
what
nations
lay
around
them
;
and
were
*NL*
informed
,
that
there
were
,
several
fierce
and
terrible
people
lived
*NL*
every
way
,
accustomed
to
eat
mankind
;
but
for
themselves
they
never
used
*NL*
such
diet
,
except
those
that
were
taken
in
battle
,
and
of
them
they
made
*NL*
a
solemn
feast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Englishmen
inquired
how
long
it
was
since
they
had
a
feast
of
that
*NL*
kind
?
They
answered
,
_
about
two
moons
ago
_
,
pointing
to
the
moon
,
and
*NL*
then
two
fingers
;
that
,
_
at
this
time
,
their
king
had
two
hundred
*NL*
prisoners
,
which
were
fattening
up
for
the
slaughter
_
.
The
Englishmen
*NL*
were
mighty
desirous
of
seeing
the
prisoners
,
which
the
others
*NL*
mistaking
,
thought
that
they
wanted
some
of
them
for
their
own
food
:
*NL*
upon
which
they
beckoned
to
them
,
pointing
to
the
rising
,
and
then
to
*NL*
the
setting
of
the
sun
;
meaning
,
that
by
the
time
it
appeared
in
the
*NL*
east
next
morning
,
they
would
bring
them
some
:
and
indeed
they
were
as
*NL*
good
as
their
word
;
for
by
that
time
they
brought
eleven
men
&
five
*NL*
women
,
just
as
so
many
cows
&
oxen
are
brought
to
sea-port
towns
to
*NL*
victual
a
ship
.
But
as
brutish
as
these
Englishmen
were
,
their
stomachs
*NL*
turned
at
the
sight
.
What
to
do
in
this
case
,
they
could
not
tell
:
to
*NL*
refuse
the
prisoner
,
would
have
been
the
highest
affront
offered
to
the
*NL*
savage
gentry
;
and
to
dispose
of
them
,
they
knew
not
,
in
what
manner
;
*NL*
however
,
they
resolved
to
accept
them
,
and
so
gave
them
,
in
return
,
one
*NL*
of
their
hatchets
,
an
old
key
,
a
knife
,
and
six
or
seven
of
their
*NL*
bullets
;
things
which
,
tho
'
they
were
wholly
ignorant
of
,
yet
of
seemed
*NL*
entirely
contented
with
;
&
dragging
the
poor
wretches
into
the
boat
,
*NL*
with
their
hands
bound
behind
them
,
delivered
them
to
the
Englishmen
.
*NL*
But
this
obliged
them
to
put
off
as
soon
as
they
had
these
presents
,
*NL*
lest
the
donors
should
have
expected
two
or
three
of
them
to
be
killed
,
*NL*
and
to
be
invited
to
dinner
the
next
day
;
and
so
taking
leave
with
all
*NL*
possible
respect
and
thanks
,
though
neither
of
them
understood
what
the
*NL*
others
said
,
they
sailed
away
back
to
the
first
island
,
and
there
set
*NL*
eight
of
the
prisoners
at
liberty
.
In
their
voyage
they
endeavoured
to
*NL*
comfort
,
and
have
some
conversation
with
the
poor
captives
;
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
make
them
sensible
of
any
thing
;
and
nothing
they
could
*NL*
say
or
give
,
or
do
for
them
,
could
make
them
otherwise
persuaded
,
but
*NL*
that
they
were
unbound
only
to
be
devoured
:
if
they
gave
them
any
food
,
*NL*
they
thought
it
was
only
to
fatten
them
for
the
slaughter
;
or
looked
at
*NL*
any
one
more
particularly
,
the
poor
creature
supposed
itself
to
be
the
*NL*
`
first
sacrifice
'
;
and
even
when
we
brought
them
to
our
island
,
and
*NL*
began
to
use
them
with
the
greatest
humanity
and
kindness
,
yet
they
*NL*
expected
every
day
that
their
new
masters
would
devour
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
thus
,
Sir
,
did
these
three
strange
wanderers
conclude
their
*NL*
unaccountable
relation
of
their
voyage
,
which
was
both
amazing
and
*NL*
entertaining
.
Hereupon
,
I
asked
them
,
where
there
new
family
was
?
They
*NL*
told
me
_
they
had
put
them
into
one
of
their
huts
,
and
they
came
to
beg
*NL*
some
victuals
for
them
_
.
This
,
indeed
,
made
us
all
long
to
see
them
;
and
*NL*
taking
Friday
's
father
with
us
,
leaving
only
two
at
our
castle
,
we
came
*NL*
down
to
behold
these
poor
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
arrived
at
the
hut
,
-LRB-
they
being
bound
again
by
the
Englishmen
,
*NL*
for
fear
of
escaping
-RRB-
we
found
them
stark
naked
,
expecting
their
fatal
*NL*
tragedy
:
there
were
three
lusty
men
,
well
shaped
,
with
straight
and
good
*NL*
limbs
,
between
thirty
and
five
and
thirty
years
old
;
and
five
women
,
two
*NL*
of
them
might
be
from
thirty
to
forty
,
two
more
not
above
four
and
*NL*
twenty
;
and
the
last
,
a
comely
tall
maiden
of
about
seventeen
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
all
the
women
were
very
agreeable
,
both
in
proportion
and
features
,
*NL*
except
that
they
were
tawny
,
which
their
modest
behaviour
,
and
other
*NL*
graces
,
made
amends
for
,
when
they
afterwards
came
to
be
clothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
naked
appearance
,
together
with
their
miserable
circumstances
,
was
*NL*
no
very
comfortable
sight
to
my
Spaniards
,
who
,
for
their
parts
,
I
may
*NL*
venture
,
Sir
,
without
flattery
,
to
say
,
are
men
of
the
best
behaviour
,
*NL*
calmest
tempers
,
and
sweetest
nature
,
that
can
possibly
be
;
for
they
*NL*
immediately
ordered
Friday
's
father
to
see
if
he
knew
any
of
them
,
or
if
*NL*
he
understood
what
they
could
say
.
No
sooner
did
the
old
Indian
appear
,
*NL*
but
he
looked
at
them
with
great
seriousness
;
yet
,
as
they
were
not
of
*NL*
his
nation
,
they
were
utter
strangers
to
him
,
and
none
could
understand
*NL*
his
speech
or
signs
,
but
one
woman
.
This
was
enough
to
answer
the
*NL*
design
,
which
was
to
assure
them
they
would
not
be
killed
,
being
fallen
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
Christians
,
who
abhorred
such
barbarity
.
When
they
*NL*
were
fully
satisfied
of
this
,
they
expressed
their
joy
by
such
strange
*NL*
gestures
,
and
uncommon
tones
,
as
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
describe
.
*NL*
But
the
woman
their
interpreter
,
was
ordered
next
to
enquire
,
whether
*NL*
they
were
content
to
be
servants
,
and
would
work
for
the
men
who
had
*NL*
brought
them
hither
to
save
their
lives
?
Hereupon
,
-LRB-
being
at
this
time
*NL*
unbound
-RRB-
they
fell
a
capering
and
dancing
,
one
taking
this
thing
upon
*NL*
her
shoulders
,
and
the
other
that
,
intimating
,
that
they
were
willing
to
*NL*
do
any
thing
for
them
.
But
now
,
Sir
,
having
women
among
us
,
and
dreading
*NL*
that
it
might
occasion
some
strife
,
if
not
blood
,
I
asked
the
three
men
*NL*
`
what
they
would
do
,
and
how
they
intended
to
use
these
creatures
,
*NL*
whether
as
servants
or
women
?
'
One
of
them
very
pertly
and
readily
*NL*
answered
,
`
they
would
use
them
as
both
,
'
_
Gentlemen
_
,
said
I
_
as
you
are
*NL*
your
own
masters
,
I
am
not
going
to
restrain
you
from
that
;
but
*NL*
methinks
,
for
avoiding
dissentions
among
you
,
I
would
only
desire
you
to
*NL*
engage
,
that
none
of
you
will
take
more
than
one
for
a
woman
or
wife
,
*NL*
and
that
having
taken
this
one
,
none
else
should
presume
to
touch
her
;
*NL*
for
though
we
have
not
yet
a
priestly
authority
to
marry
you
,
yet
it
is
*NL*
but
reasonable
,
that
whoever
thus
takes
a
woman
,
should
be
obliged
to
*NL*
maintain
her
,
since
nobody
has
any
thing
to
do
with
her
_
;
and
this
,
*NL*
indeed
,
appeared
so
just
to
all
present
,
that
it
was
unanimously
agreed
*NL*
to
.
The
Englishmen
then
asked
my
Spaniards
,
`
whether
they
designed
to
*NL*
take
any
of
them
?
but
they
all
answered
,
_
No
_
;
some
declaring
they
had
*NL*
already
wives
in
Spain
;
and
others
that
they
cared
not
to
join
with
*NL*
infidels
.
On
the
reverse
,
the
Englishmen
took
each
of
them
a
temporary
*NL*
wife
,
and
so
set
up
a
new
method
of
living
.
As
to
Friday
's
father
,
the
*NL*
Spaniards
,
and
the
three
savage
servants
we
had
taken
in
the
late
*NL*
battle
,
they
all
lived
with
me
in
our
ancient
castle
;
and
indeed
we
*NL*
supplied
the
main
part
of
the
island
with
food
,
as
necessity
required
.
*NL*
But
the
most
remarkable
part
of
the
story
is
,
how
these
Englishmen
,
who
*NL*
had
been
so
much
at
variance
,
should
agree
about
the
choice
of
those
*NL*
women
;
yet
they
took
a
way
good
enough
to
prevent
quarreling
among
*NL*
themselves
.
They
let
the
five
women
in
one
of
their
huts
,
and
going
*NL*
themselves
to
the
other
,
drew
lots
which
should
have
the
first
choice
.
*NL*
Now
,
he
that
had
the
first
lot
went
to
the
hut
,
and
fetched
out
her
he
*NL*
chose
;
and
it
is
remarkable
,
that
he
took
her
that
was
the
most
homely
*NL*
and
eldest
of
the
number
,
which
made
the
rest
of
the
Englishmen
*NL*
exceedingly
merry
;
the
Spaniards
themselves
could
not
help
but
smile
at
*NL*
it
;
but
as
it
happened
,
the
fellow
had
the
best
thought
,
in
choosing
*NL*
one
fit
for
application
and
business
;
and
indeed
she
proved
the
best
*NL*
wife
of
all
the
parcel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
the
poor
creatures
perceived
themselves
placed
in
a
row
,
and
*NL*
separated
one
by
one
,
they
were
again
seized
with
an
unspeakable
terror
,
*NL*
as
now
thinking
they
were
going
to
be
slain
in
earnest
;
and
when
the
*NL*
Englishmen
came
to
take
the
first
,
the
rest
set
up
a
lamentable
cry
,
*NL*
clasped
their
arms
around
her
neck
,
and
hanging
about
her
,
took
their
*NL*
last
farewell
,
as
they
thought
,
in
such
trembling
agonies
,
and
*NL*
affectionate
embraces
,
as
would
have
softened
the
hardest
heart
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
made
the
driest
eyes
melt
into
tears
;
nor
could
they
be
*NL*
persuaded
but
that
they
were
going
to
die
,
till
such
time
as
Friday
's
*NL*
father
made
them
sensible
that
the
Englishmen
had
chosen
them
for
their
*NL*
wives
,
which
ended
all
their
terror
and
concern
upon
this
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
after
this
,
the
Englishmen
went
to
work
,
and
being
assisted
by
my
*NL*
good
natured
Spaniards
,
in
a
few
hours
they
,
erected
every
one
of
them
a
*NL*
new
hut
or
tent
for
their
separate
lodging
,
since
those
they
had
already
*NL*
were
,
filled
with
tools
,
household
stuff
,
and
provision
.
They
all
*NL*
continued
on
the
north
shore
of
the
island
,
but
separate
as
before
;
the
*NL*
three
wicked
ones
pitching
farther
off
,
and
the
two
honest
men
nearer
*NL*
our
castle
;
so
that
the
island
seemed
to
be
peopled
in
three
places
,
*NL*
three
towns
beginning
to
be
built
for
that
purpose
.
And
here
I
can
not
*NL*
but
remark
,
what
is
very
common
,
that
the
two
honest
men
had
the
worst
*NL*
wives
,
-LRB-
I
mean
as
to
industry
,
cleanliness
,
and
ingenuity
-RRB-
while
the
*NL*
three
reprobates
enjoyed
women
of
quite
contrary
qualities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
another
observation
I
made
was
,
in
favour
of
the
two
honest
men
,
to
*NL*
show
what
disparity
there
is
between
a
diligent
application
to
business
,
*NL*
on
the
one
hand
,
and
a
slothful
negligent
,
and
idle
temper
,
on
the
*NL*
other
.
Both
of
them
had
the
same
parcel
of
ground
laid
out
,
and
corn
to
*NL*
sow
,
sufficient
either
in
their
cultivation
or
their
planting
.
The
two
*NL*
honest
men
had
a
multitude
of
young
trees
planted
about
their
*NL*
habitations
,
so
that
when
you
approached
near
them
,
nothing
appeared
but
*NL*
a
wood
,
very
pleasing
and
delightful
.
Every
thing
they
did
prospered
and
*NL*
flourished
:
their
grapes
,
planted
in
order
,
seemed
as
though
managed
in
*NL*
a
vineyard
and
were
infinitely
preferable
to
any
of
the
others
.
Nor
were
*NL*
they
wanting
to
find
out
a
place
of
retreat
,
but
dug
a
cave
in
the
most
*NL*
retired
part
of
a
thick
wood
,
to
secure
their
wives
and
children
,
with
*NL*
their
provision
and
chiefest
goods
,
surrounded
with
innumerable
stakes
,
*NL*
and
having
a
most
subtle
entrance
,
in
case
any
mischief
should
happen
*NL*
either
from
their
fellow
countrymen
,
or
the
devouring
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
reprobates
,
-LRB-
though
I
must
own
they
were
much
more
civilized
*NL*
than
before
-RRB-
instead
of
delightful
wood
surrounding
their
dwellings
,
we
*NL*
found
the
words
of
King
Solomon
too
truly
verified
:
_
I
went
by
the
*NL*
vineyard
of
the
slothful
,
and
it
was
all
overgrown
with
thorns
_
.
In
many
*NL*
places
their
crop
was
obliterated
by
weeds
:
the
hedges
having
several
*NL*
gaps
in
them
,
the
wild
goats
had
got
in
,
and
eaten
up
the
corn
,
and
here
*NL*
and
there
was
a
dead
bush
to
stop
these
gaps
for
the
present
,
which
was
*NL*
no
more
than
shutting
the
stable
door
after
the
steed
was
stolen
away
.
*NL*
But
as
to
their
wives
,
they
-LRB-
as
I
observed
before
-RRB-
were
more
diligent
,
*NL*
and
cleanly
enough
,
especially
in
their
victuals
,
being
instructed
by
*NL*
one
of
the
honest
men
,
who
had
been
a
cook
's
mate
on
board
a
ship
:
&
*NL*
very
well
it
was
so
,
for
as
he
cooked
himself
,
his
companion
and
their
*NL*
families
lived
as
well
as
the
idle
husbands
,
who
did
nothing
but
loiter
*NL*
about
,
fetch
turtle
's
eggs
,
catch
fish
and
birds
,
and
do
any
thing
but
*NL*
work
,
and
lived
accordingly
;
while
the
diligent
lived
very
handsomely
*NL*
and
plentifully
,
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Sir
,
I
come
to
lay
before
your
eyes
a
scene
quite
different
*NL*
from
any
thing
that
ever
happened
to
us
before
,
and
perhaps
ever
befel
*NL*
you
in
all
the
time
of
your
residence
on
this
island
.
I
shall
inform
you
*NL*
of
its
original
in
the
following
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
morning
,
Sir
,
very
early
,
there
came
five
or
six
canoes
of
Indians
*NL*
on
shore
,
indisputably
upon
their
old
custom
of
devouring
their
*NL*
prisoners
.
All
that
we
had
to
do
upon
such
an
occasion
,
was
to
lie
*NL*
concealed
,
that
they
,
not
having
any
notice
of
inhabitants
,
might
depart
*NL*
quietly
after
performing
their
bloody
execution
:
whoever
first
*NL*
discovered
the
savages
,
was
to
give
notice
to
all
the
three
plantations
*NL*
to
keep
within
doors
,
and
then
a
proper
scout
was
to
be
placed
to
give
*NL*
intelligence
of
their
departure
.
But
notwithstanding
these
wise
*NL*
measures
,
an
unhappy
disaster
discovered
us
to
the
savages
,
which
was
*NL*
like
to
have
caused
the
desolation
of
the
whole
island
;
for
,
after
the
*NL*
savages
were
gone
off
in
their
canoes
,
some
of
my
Spaniards
and
I
*NL*
looking
abroad
;
and
being
inflamed
with
a
curiosity
to
see
what
they
had
*NL*
been
doing
,
to
our
great
amazement
beheld
three
savages
fast
asleep
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
who
,
either
being
gorged
,
could
not
awake
when
the
others
*NL*
went
off
,
or
having
wandered
too
far
into
the
woods
,
did
not
come
*NL*
back
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
do
with
them
as
first
,
we
could
not
tell
;
as
for
slaves
we
had
*NL*
enough
of
them
already
;
and
as
to
killing
them
,
neither
Christianity
or
*NL*
humanity
would
suffer
us
to
shed
the
blood
of
persons
who
never
did
us
*NL*
wrong
.
We
perceived
they
had
no
boat
left
them
to
transport
them
to
*NL*
their
own
nation
;
and
that
,
by
letting
them
wander
about
,
they
might
*NL*
discover
us
,
and
inform
the
first
savages
that
should
happen
to
land
*NL*
upon
the
same
bloody
occasion
,
which
information
might
entirely
ruin
us
;
*NL*
and
therefore
I
counselled
my
Spaniards
to
secure
them
,
and
set
them
*NL*
about
some
work
or
other
,
till
we
could
better
dispose
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hereupon
we
all
went
back
,
and
making
them
awake
,
took
them
prisoners
.
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
horror
they
were
in
,
especially
when
*NL*
bound
,
as
thinking
they
were
going
to
be
murdered
and
eaten
,
but
we
soon
*NL*
eased
them
of
their
fear
as
to
that
point
.
We
first
took
them
to
the
*NL*
bower
,
where
the
chief
of
our
country
work
lay
as
keeping
goats
,
*NL*
planting
corn
,
&
c
and
then
carried
them
to
the
two
Englishmen
's
*NL*
habitation
,
to
help
them
in
their
business
;
but
happy
it
was
for
us
all
*NL*
we
did
not
carry
them
to
our
castle
,
as
by
the
sequel
will
appear
.
The
*NL*
Englishmen
,
indeed
,
found
them
work
to
do
;
but
whether
they
did
not
*NL*
guard
them
strictly
,
or
that
they
thought
they
could
not
better
*NL*
themselves
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
certainly
one
of
them
ran
away
into
the
*NL*
woods
,
and
they
could
not
hear
of
him
for
a
long
time
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
there
was
reason
enough
to
suppose
he
got
home
in
some
of
*NL*
the
canoes
,
the
savages
returning
in
about
four
weeks
time
,
and
going
*NL*
off
in
the
space
of
two
days
.
You
may
be
certain
,
Sir
,
this
thought
*NL*
could
not
but
terrify
us
exceedingly
,
and
make
us
justly
conclude
,
that
*NL*
the
savage
would
inform
his
countrymen
of
our
abode
in
the
island
,
how
*NL*
few
and
weak
we
were
in
comparison
to
their
numbers
&
we
expected
it
*NL*
would
not
be
long
before
the
Englishmen
would
be
attacked
in
their
*NL*
habitations
;
but
the
savages
had
not
seen
their
places
of
safety
in
the
*NL*
woods
,
nor
our
castle
,
which
it
was
a
great
happiness
they
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
were
we
mistaken
in
our
thoughts
upon
this
occasion
:
for
,
about
*NL*
eight
months
after
this
,
six
canoes
,
with
about
ten
men
in
each
canoe
,
*NL*
came
sailing
by
the
north
side
of
the
island
,
which
they
were
never
*NL*
accustomed
to
do
before
,
and
landed
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
,
near
a
*NL*
mile
from
the
dwelling
of
the
two
Englishman
,
who
,
it
seems
,
had
the
*NL*
good
fortune
to
discover
them
about
a
league
off
:
to
that
it
was
an
hour
*NL*
before
they
could
come
at
them
.
And
now
being
confirmed
in
this
opinion
*NL*
that
they
were
certainly
betrayed
,
they
immediately
bound
the
two
slaves
*NL*
which
were
left
,
causing
two
of
the
three
men
,
whom
they
brought
with
*NL*
the
women
,
and
who
proved
very
faithful
to
lead
them
with
their
wives
,
*NL*
and
other
conveniences
,
into
their
retired
care
in
the
wood
,
and
there
*NL*
to
bind
the
two
fellows
hand
and
foot
till
they
had
further
orders
.
They
*NL*
then
opened
their
fences
,
where
they
kept
their
milch
goats
,
and
drove
*NL*
them
all
out
,
giving
the
goats
liberty
to
ramble
in
the
woods
,
to
make
*NL*
the
savages
believe
that
they
were
wild
ones
;
but
the
slave
had
given
a
*NL*
truer
information
,
which
made
them
come
to
the
very
inclosures
.
The
two
*NL*
frighted
men
sent
the
other
slave
of
the
three
,
who
had
been
with
them
*NL*
by
accident
,
to
alarm
the
Spaniards
,
and
desire
their
assistance
;
in
*NL*
the
mean
time
they
took
their
arms
and
ammunition
,
and
made
to
the
cave
*NL*
where
they
had
sent
their
wives
,
and
securing
their
slaves
,
seated
*NL*
themselves
in
a
private
place
,
from
whence
they
might
behold
all
the
*NL*
actions
of
the
savages
.
Nor
had
they
gone
far
,
when
ascending
a
rising
*NL*
ground
,
they
could
see
a
little
army
of
Indians
approach
to
their
*NL*
beautiful
dwelling
,
and
in
a
few
moments
more
,
perceive
the
same
,
and
*NL*
their
furniture
,
to
their
unspeakable
grief
,
burning
in
a
consuming
*NL*
flame
,
and
when
this
war
done
,
they
spread
here
and
there
,
searching
*NL*
every
bush
and
place
for
the
people
,
of
whom
it
was
very
evident
,
they
*NL*
had
information
.
Upon
which
the
two
Englishmen
,
not
thinking
themselves
*NL*
secure
where
they
stood
,
retreated
about
half
a
mile
higher
in
the
*NL*
country
,
rightly
concluding
,
that
the
farther
the
savages
strolled
,
*NL*
there
would
be
less
numbers
together
:
upon
which
they
next
took
their
*NL*
stand
by
the
trunk
of
an
old
tree
,
very
hollow
and
large
,
whence
they
*NL*
resolved
to
see
what
would
offer
:
but
they
had
not
stood
long
there
,
*NL*
before
two
savages
came
running
directly
towards
them
,
as
though
having
*NL*
knowledge
of
their
being
there
,
who
seemed
resolved
to
attack
them
;
a
*NL*
little
farther
were
three
more
,
and
five
more
behind
them
again
,
all
*NL*
running
the
same
way
.
It
can
not
be
imagined
the
perplexity
the
poor
men
*NL*
were
in
at
this
sight
,
thinking
that
if
assistance
did
not
speedily
come
*NL*
their
cave
in
the
wood
would
be
discovered
,
and
consequently
all
therein
*NL*
lost
;
so
they
resolved
to
resist
them
there
,
and
,
when
overpowered
,
to
*NL*
ascend
to
the
top
of
the
trees
,
where
they
might
defend
themselves
as
*NL*
long
as
their
ammunition
lasted
,
and
sell
their
lives
as
dear
as
*NL*
possible
to
those
devouring
savages
.
Thus
fixed
in
their
resolution
,
*NL*
they
next
considered
,
whether
they
should
fire
at
the
first
two
,
or
wait
*NL*
for
the
three
,
and
so
take
the
middle
party
,
by
which
the
two
first
&
*NL*
the
five
last
would
be
separated
.
In
this
regulation
the
two
savages
*NL*
also
confirmed
them
,
by
turning
a
little
to
another
part
of
the
wood
:
*NL*
but
the
three
,
&
the
five
after
them
,
came
directly
towards
the
tree
.
*NL*
Hereupon
they
resolved
to
take
them
in
a
direct
line
,
as
they
approached
*NL*
nearer
,
because
perhaps
the
first
shot
might
hit
them
all
three
;
and
*NL*
upon
this
occasion
,
the
man
who
was
to
fire
,
charged
his
piece
with
*NL*
three
or
four
bullets
.
And
thus
while
they
were
waiting
,
the
savages
*NL*
came
on
,
one
of
them
was
the
runaway
,
who
had
caused
all
the
mischief
;
*NL*
so
they
resolved
he
should
not
escape
,
if
they
both
fired
at
once
.
But
,
*NL*
however
,
though
they
did
not
fire
together
,
they
were
ready
charged
;
*NL*
when
the
first
that
let
fly
,
was
too
good
a
marksman
to
miss
his
aim
;
*NL*
for
he
killed
the
foremost
outright
,
the
second
-LRB-
_
who
was
the
runaway
*NL*
Indian
_
-RRB-
fell
to
the
ground
,
being
shot
through
the
body
,
but
not
dead
*NL*
and
the
third
was
a
little
wounded
in
the
shoulder
,
who
,
sitting
down
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
fell
a
screaming
in
a
most
fearful
manner
.
The
noise
of
the
*NL*
guns
,
which
not
only
made
the
most
resounding
echoes
,
from
one
side
to
*NL*
the
other
,
but
raised
the
birds
of
all
sorts
,
fluttering
with
the
most
*NL*
confused
noise
,
so
much
terrified
the
five
savages
behind
that
they
*NL*
stood
still
at
first
,
like
so
many
inanimate
images
.
But
when
all
things
*NL*
were
in
profound
silence
,
they
came
to
the
place
where
there
companions
*NL*
lay
;
and
here
,
not
being
sensible
that
they
were
liable
to
the
same
*NL*
fate
,
stood
over
the
wounded
man
,
undoubtedly
inquiring
the
occasion
of
*NL*
this
sad
calamity
;
and
't
is
as
reasonable
to
suppose
he
told
them
,
that
*NL*
it
came
by
thunder
and
lightning
from
the
gods
,
having
never
seen
or
*NL*
heard
of
a
gun
before
,
in
the
whole
course
of
their
lives
.
By
this
time
*NL*
the
Englishmen
,
having
loaded
their
pieces
,
fired
both
together
a
second
*NL*
time
,
when
seeing
them
all
fall
immediately
on
the
ground
,
they
thought
*NL*
they
had
killed
every
creature
of
them
.
This
made
them
come
up
boldly
*NL*
before
they
had
charged
their
guns
,
which
indeed
was
a
wrong
step
;
for
,
*NL*
when
they
came
to
the
place
,
they
found
four
alive
,
two
of
them
very
*NL*
little
wounded
,
and
one
not
at
all
,
which
obliged
them
to
fall
upon
them
*NL*
with
their
muskets
:
they
first
knocked
the
runaway
savage
on
the
head
,
*NL*
and
another
that
was
but
a
little
wounded
in
the
arm
,
&
then
put
the
*NL*
other
languishing
wretches
out
of
their
pain
:
while
he
that
was
not
*NL*
hurt
,
with
bended
knees
and
uplifted
hands
,
made
piteous
moans
,
and
*NL*
signs
to
them
to
spare
his
life
;
nor
,
indeed
,
were
they
unmerciful
to
*NL*
the
poor
wretch
,
but
pointed
to
him
to
sit
down
at
the
root
of
a
tree
*NL*
hard
by
;
and
then
,
one
of
the
Englishmen
,
with
a
piece
of
rope
twine
he
*NL*
had
in
his
pocket
,
by
mere
chance
,
tying
his
two
feet
fast
together
,
and
*NL*
his
two
hands
behind
him
,
they
left
him
there
,
making
all
the
haste
they
*NL*
could
after
the
other
two
,
fearing
they
should
find
out
their
cave
;
but
*NL*
though
they
could
not
overtake
them
,
they
had
the
satisfaction
to
*NL*
perceive
them
at
a
distance
,
cross
a
valley
towards
the
sea
,
a
quite
*NL*
contrary
way
to
their
retreat
:
upon
which
they
returned
to
the
tree
,
to
*NL*
look
after
their
prisoner
;
but
when
they
came
there
,
he
was
gone
,
*NL*
leaving
the
piece
of
rope-yarn
,
wherewith
he
was
bound
,
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
they
were
as
much
concerned
as
ever
,
as
not
knowing
how
near
*NL*
their
enemies
might
be
,
or
in
what
numbers
.
Immediately
they
repaired
to
*NL*
the
cave
,
to
see
if
all
was
well
there
,
and
found
every
thing
safe
,
*NL*
except
the
women
,
who
were
frightened
upon
their
husbands
account
,
whom
*NL*
they
now
loved
entirely
.
They
had
not
been
long
here
,
before
seven
of
my
*NL*
Spaniards
came
to
assist
them
;
while
the
other
ten
,
their
servants
,
and
*NL*
Friday
's
father
,
were
gone
to
defend
their
bower
,
corn
,
and
cattle
,
in
*NL*
case
the
savages
should
have
rambled
so
far
.
There
accompanied
the
seven
*NL*
Spaniards
,
one
of
the
three
savages
that
had
formerly
been
taken
*NL*
prisoner
;
and
with
them
also
that
very
Indian
whom
the
Englishmen
had
,
*NL*
a
little
before
,
left
under
the
tree
;
for
it
seems
,
they
passed
by
that
*NL*
way
where
the
slaughter
was
made
,
and
so
carried
along
with
them
that
*NL*
poor
wretch
that
was
left
bound
.
But
so
many
prisoners
now
becoming
a
*NL*
burthen
to
us
,
and
fearing
the
dreadful
consequence
of
their
escaping
,
*NL*
most
of
the
Spaniards
and
English
urged
the
absolute
necessity
there
was
*NL*
of
killing
them
for
our
common
preservation
;
but
,
Sir
,
the
authority
I
*NL*
bore
,
as
a
governor
,
over-ruled
that
piece
of
cruelty
;
and
then
I
*NL*
ordered
them
to
be
sent
prisoners
to
the
old
cave
in
the
valley
,
bound
*NL*
hands
and
feet
,
with
two
Spaniards
to
guard
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
encouraged
were
the
Englishmen
at
the
approach
of
the
*NL*
Spaniards
,
and
so
great
was
their
fury
against
the
savages
for
*NL*
destroying
their
habitations
,
that
they
had
not
patience
to
stay
any
*NL*
longer
;
but
,
taking
five
Spaniards
along
with
them
,
armed
with
four
*NL*
muskets
,
a
pistol
,
and
a
quarter
staff
,
away
they
went
in
pursuit
of
*NL*
their
enemies
.
As
they
passed
by
the
place
where
the
savages
were
slain
,
*NL*
it
was
very
easy
to
be
perceived
that
more
of
them
had
been
there
,
*NL*
having
attempted
to
carry
off
their
dead
bodies
,
but
found
it
*NL*
impracticable
.
From
a
rising
ground
our
party
had
the
mortification
to
*NL*
see
the
smoke
that
proceeded
from
their
ruins
;
when
coming
farther
in
*NL*
flight
of
the
shore
,
they
plainly
perceived
that
the
savages
had
*NL*
embarked
in
their
canoes
,
and
were
putting
out
to
sea
.
This
they
were
*NL*
very
sorry
for
,
there
being
no
coming
at
them
to
give
them
a
parting
*NL*
salute
,
but
however
,
they
were
glad
enough
to
get
clear
of
such
*NL*
unwelcome
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
the
two
honest
,
but
unfortunate
Englishmen
,
being
ruined
a
second
*NL*
time
,
and
their
improvements
quite
destroyed
,
most
of
my
good
natured
*NL*
Spaniards
helped
them
to
rebuild
,
and
we
all
assisted
them
with
needful
*NL*
supplies
;
nay
,
what
is
more
remarkable
,
their
three
mischievous
*NL*
countrymen
,
when
they
heard
of
it
_
-LRB-
which
was
after
all
these
disasters
*NL*
were
over
,
they
living
more
remote
eastward
-RRB-
_
very
friendly
sympathised
*NL*
with
them
,
and
worked
for
them
several
days
;
so
that
,
in
a
little
,
their
*NL*
habitations
were
rebuilt
,
their
necessities
supplied
,
and
themselves
*NL*
restored
to
their
former
tranquility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
the
savages
had
nothing
to
boast
of
in
this
adventure
,
_
-LRB-
several
*NL*
canoes
being
driven
ashore
,
followed
by
two
drowned
creatures
,
having
*NL*
undoubtedly
met
with
a
storm
at
sea
that
very
night
they
departed
-RRB-
_
yet
*NL*
it
was
natural
to
be
supposed
,
that
those
whose
better
fortune
it
was
to
*NL*
attain
their
native
shore
,
would
inflame
their
nation
to
another
ruinous
*NL*
attempt
,
with
a
greater
force
,
to
carry
all
before
them
.
And
,
indeed
,
so
*NL*
it
happened
:
for
about
seven
months
after
,
our
island
was
invaded
with
a
*NL*
most
formidable
navy
,
no
less
than
eight
and
twenty
canoes
full
of
*NL*
savages
,
armed
with
wooden
swords
,
monstrous
clubs
,
bows
and
arrows
,
and
*NL*
such
like
instruments
of
war
,
landing
at
the
east
end
of
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
,
Sir
,
imagine
what
consternation
our
men
were
in
upon
*NL*
this
account
,
and
how
speedy
they
were
to
execute
their
resolution
,
*NL*
having
only
that
night
's
time
allowed
them
.
They
knew
that
since
they
*NL*
could
not
withstand
their
enemies
,
concealment
was
the
only
way
to
*NL*
procure
their
safety
;
and
,
therefore
,
they
took
down
the
huts
that
were
*NL*
built
for
the
two
Englishmen
,
and
drove
their
flocks
of
goats
together
*NL*
with
their
own
at
the
bower
,
to
the
old
cave
in
the
valley
,
leaving
as
*NL*
little
appearance
of
inhabitants
as
possible
;
and
then
posted
*NL*
themselves
,
with
all
their
force
,
at
the
plantation
of
the
two
men
.
As
*NL*
they
expected
,
so
it
happened
:
for
early
the
next
morning
,
the
Indians
,
*NL*
leaving
their
canoes
at
the
east-end
of
the
island
,
came
running
along
*NL*
the
shore
,
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
number
,
as
near
as
could
be
*NL*
guessed
.
Our
army
was
but
little
indeed
;
and
what
was
our
greatest
*NL*
misfortune
,
we
had
not
arms
sufficient
for
them
.
The
account
,
as
to
the
*NL*
men
,
Sir
,
is
an
follows
:
viz
.
17
_
Spaniards
_
,
5
_
Englishmen
,
Old
Friday
,
*NL*
the
three
savages
,
taken
with
the
five
women
,
who
proved
faithful
*NL*
servants
,
and
three
other
slaves
,
living
with
the
Spaniards
.
To
arm
*NL*
these
they
had
_
11
_
muskets
_
,
5
_
pistols
_
,
3
_
fowling-pieces
_
,
2
*NL*
_
swords
_
,
3
_
old
halberts
_
,
5
_
muskets
,
or
fowling-pieces
,
taken
from
*NL*
the
sailors
whom
you
reduced
.
As
to
the
slaves
,
we
gave
three
of
them
*NL*
halberts
,
and
the
other
three
long
staves
,
with
great
iron
spikes
at
the
*NL*
end
of
them
,
with
hatchets
by
their
sides
;
we
also
had
hatchets
sticking
*NL*
in
our
girdles
,
besides
the
fire-arms
:
nay
,
two
of
the
women
,
inspired
*NL*
with
Amazonian
fortitude
,
could
not
be
dissuaded
from
fighting
along
*NL*
with
their
dear
husbands
,
and
if
they
died
,
to
die
with
them
,
Seeing
*NL*
their
resolution
,
we
gave
them
hatchets
likewise
;
but
what
pleased
them
*NL*
best
,
were
the
bows
and
arrows
-LRB-
which
they
dexterously
knew
how
to
use
-RRB-
*NL*
that
the
Indians
had
left
behind
them
,
after
their
memorable
battle
one
*NL*
against
another
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
this
army
,
which
though
little
,
was
of
great
intrepidity
,
I
was
*NL*
constituted
chief
general
and
commander
:
and
knowing
Will
Atkins
,
though
*NL*
exceedingly
wicked
,
yet
a
man
of
invincible
courage
,
I
gave
him
the
*NL*
power
of
commanding
under
me
:
he
had
six
men
with
their
muskets
loaded
*NL*
with
six
or
seven
bullets
a-piece
,
and
were
planted
just
behind
a
small
*NL*
thicket
of
bushes
,
as
an
advanced
guard
,
having
orders
to
let
the
first
*NL*
pass
by
;
and
then
,
when
he
fired
into
the
middle
of
them
,
making
a
*NL*
nimble
retreat
round
a
part
of
the
wood
,
and
so
come
in
the
rear
of
the
*NL*
Spaniards
,
who
were
shaded
by
a
thicket
of
trees
:
for
though
the
savages
*NL*
came
on
with
the
fierceness
of
lions
,
yet
they
wanted
the
subtility
of
*NL*
foxes
,
being
out
of
all
manner
of
order
,
and
straggling
in
heaps
every
*NL*
way
:
and
,
indeed
,
when
Will
Atkins
,
after
fifty
of
the
savages
had
*NL*
passed
by
,
had
ordered
three
of
his
men
to
give
fire
,
so
great
was
their
*NL*
consternation
,
to
see
so
many
men
killed
and
wounded
,
and
hear
such
a
*NL*
dreadful
noise
,
and
yet
knew
not
whence
it
came
,
that
they
were
*NL*
frightened
to
the
highest
degree
:
and
when
the
second
volley
was
given
,
*NL*
they
concluded
no
less
but
that
their
companions
were
slain
by
thunder
*NL*
and
lightning
from
Heaven
.
In
this
notion
they
would
have
continued
,
had
*NL*
Will
Atkins
and
his
men
retired
,
as
soon
as
they
fired
,
according
to
*NL*
order
:
or
had
the
rest
been
near
them
,
to
pour
in
their
shot
*NL*
continually
,
their
might
have
been
a
complete
victory
obtained
:
but
*NL*
staying
to
load
their
pieces
again
,
discovered
the
whole
matter
.
They
*NL*
were
perceived
by
some
of
the
scattering
savages
at
a
distance
,
who
let
*NL*
fly
their
arrows
among
them
,
wounded
Atkins
himself
,
and
killed
his
*NL*
fellow
Englishman
,
and
one
of
the
Indians
taken
with
the
women
.
Our
*NL*
party
did
not
fail
to
answer
them
,
and
in
their
retreat
killed
about
*NL*
twenty
savages
.
Here
I
can
not
but
take
notice
of
our
poor
dying
slave
,
*NL*
who
,
tho
'
stopt
from
his
retreat
by
a
fatal
arrow
,
yet
with
his
staff
*NL*
and
hatchet
,
desperately
and
gallantly
assailed
his
pursuers
,
and
killed
*NL*
five
of
the
savages
,
before
his
life
submitted
to
a
multiplicity
of
*NL*
wounds
.
Nor
is
the
cruelty
or
malice
of
the
Indians
to
be
less
remarked
,
*NL*
in
breaking
the
arms
,
legs
,
and
heads
of
the
two
dead
bodies
,
with
their
*NL*
clubs
and
wooden
swords
,
after
a
most
wretched
manner
.
As
Atkins
*NL*
retreated
our
party
advanced
,
to
interpose
between
him
and
the
savages
:
*NL*
but
after
three
vollies
,
we
were
obliged
to
retreat
also
:
for
they
were
*NL*
so
numerous
and
desperate
,
that
they
came
up
to
our
very
teeth
,
shot
*NL*
their
arrows
like
a
cloud
,
and
their
wounded
men
,
enraged
with
cruel
*NL*
pain
,
fought
like
madmen
.
They
did
not
,
however
,
think
fit
to
follow
us
,
*NL*
but
drawing
themselves
up
in
a
circle
,
they
gave
two
triumphant
shouts
*NL*
in
token
of
victory
,
though
they
had
the
grief
to
see
several
of
their
*NL*
wounded
men
bleed
to
death
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
I
had
,
Sir
,
drawn
up
our
little
army
together
,
upon
a
rising
*NL*
ground
,
Atkins
,
wounded
as
he
was
,
would
have
had
us
attack
the
whole
*NL*
body
of
the
savages
at
once
,
I
was
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
*NL*
gallantry
of
the
man
:
but
,
upon
consideration
,
I
replied
,
_
You
perceive
,
*NL*
Seignor
Atkins
,
how
their
wounded
men
fight
;
let
them
alone
till
*NL*
morning
,
when
they
will
be
faint
,
stiff
,
and
sore
,
and
then
we
shall
*NL*
have
fewer
to
combat
with
_
.
To
which
Atkins
,
smiling
,
replied
,
_
That
's
*NL*
very
true
,
Seignor
,
so
shall
I
too
;
and
that
's
the
reason
I
would
fight
*NL*
them
now
I
am
warm
_
.
We
all
answered
,
_
Seignor
Atkins
for
your
part
you
*NL*
have
behaved
very
gallantly
;
and
,
if
you
are
not
able
to
approach
the
*NL*
enemy
in
the
morning
,
we
will
fight
for
you
,
till
then
we
think
it
*NL*
convenient
to
wait
_
,
and
so
we
tarried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
brightness
of
the
moon
that
night
,
we
perceived
the
savages
in
*NL*
great
disorder
about
their
dead
and
wounded
men
.
This
made
us
change
our
*NL*
resolution
,
and
resolve
to
fall
upon
them
in
the
night
,
if
we
could
*NL*
give
them
one
volley
undiscovered
.
This
we
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
do
,
*NL*
by
one
of
the
two
Englishmen
leading
us
round
,
between
the
woods
and
the
*NL*
sea-side
westward
,
and
turning
short
south
,
came
privately
to
a
place
*NL*
where
the
thickest
of
them
were
.
Unheard
and
unperceived
,
eight
of
us
*NL*
fired
among
them
,
and
did
dreadful
execution
;
and
in
half
a
minute
*NL*
after
,
eight
more
of
us
let
fly
,
killing
and
wounding
abundance
of
them
;
*NL*
and
then
dividing
ourselves
into
three
bodies
,
eight
persons
in
each
*NL*
body
we
marched
from
among
the
trees
,
to
the
very
teeth
of
the
enemy
,
*NL*
sending
forth
the
greatest
shouts
and
acclamations
.
The
savages
hearing
*NL*
a
different
noise
from
three
quarters
at
once
,
stood
in
the
utmost
*NL*
confusion
;
but
coming
in
sight
of
us
,
let
fly
a
volley
of
arrows
,
which
*NL*
wounded
poor
old
Friday
,
yet
happily
it
did
not
prove
mortal
.
We
did
*NL*
not
,
however
,
give
them
a
second
opportunity
;
but
rushing
in
among
them
,
*NL*
we
fired
three
several
ways
,
and
then
fell
to
work
with
our
swords
,
*NL*
staves
,
hatchets
,
and
the
butt-end
of
our
muskets
,
with
a
fury
not
to
be
*NL*
resisted
;
so
that
with
the
most
dismal
screaming
and
howling
they
had
*NL*
recourse
to
their
feet
,
to
save
their
lives
by
a
speedy
flight
.
Nor
must
*NL*
we
forget
the
valour
of
the
two
women
;
for
they
exposed
themselves
to
*NL*
the
greatest
dangers
,
killed
many
with
their
arrows
,
and
valiantly
*NL*
destroyed
several
more
with
their
hatchets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fighting
these
two
battles
,
we
were
so
much
tired
,
that
we
did
not
*NL*
then
trouble
ourselves
to
pursue
them
to
their
canoes
,
in
which
we
*NL*
thought
they
would
presently
put
to
the
ocean
;
but
their
happening
a
*NL*
dreadful
storm
at
sea
,
which
continuing
all
that
night
,
it
not
only
*NL*
prevented
their
voyage
,
but
dashed
several
of
their
boats
to
pieces
*NL*
against
the
beach
,
and
drove
the
rest
so
high
upon
the
shore
,
that
it
*NL*
required
infinite
labour
to
get
them
off
.
After
our
men
had
taken
some
*NL*
refreshment
and
a
little
repose
,
they
resolved
early
in
the
morning
to
*NL*
go
towards
the
place
of
their
landing
,
and
see
whether
they
were
gone
*NL*
off
,
or
in
what
posture
they
remained
.
This
necessarily
led
them
to
the
*NL*
place
of
battle
,
where
several
of
the
savages
were
expiring
,
a
sight
no
*NL*
way
pleasing
to
generous
minds
,
to
delight
in
misery
,
though
obliged
to
*NL*
conquer
them
by
the
law
of
arms
;
but
our
own
Indian
slaves
put
them
out
*NL*
of
their
pain
,
by
dispatching
them
with
their
hatchets
.
At
length
,
*NL*
coming
in
view
of
the
remainder
of
the
army
,
we
found
them
leaning
upon
*NL*
their
knees
,
which
were
bended
towards
their
mouth
,
and
the
head
between
*NL*
the
two
hands
.
Hereupon
,
coming
within
musket
shot
of
them
,
I
ordered
*NL*
two
pieces
to
be
fired
without
ball
,
in
order
to
alarm
them
,
that
we
*NL*
might
plainly
know
,
whether
they
had
the
courage
to
venture
another
*NL*
battle
,
or
were
utterly
dispirited
from
such
an
attempt
,
that
so
we
*NL*
might
accordingly
manage
them
.
And
indeed
,
the
prospect
took
very
well
;
*NL*
for
,
no
sooner
did
the
savages
hear
the
first
gun
,
and
perceive
the
*NL*
flash
of
the
second
,
but
they
suddenly
started
upon
their
feet
in
the
*NL*
greatest
consternation
;
and
when
we
approached
towards
them
,
they
ran
*NL*
howling
and
screaming
away
up
the
hill
into
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
rather
,
at
first
,
have
wished
,
that
the
weather
had
permitted
*NL*
them
to
have
gone
off
to
the
sea
;
but
when
we
considered
,
that
their
*NL*
escape
might
occasion
the
approach
of
multitudes
,
to
our
utter
ruin
and
*NL*
dissolution
;
we
were
very
well
pleased
the
contrary
happened
;
and
Will
*NL*
Atkins
-LRB-
who
,
tho
'
wounded
,
would
not
part
from
us
all
this
while
-RRB-
*NL*
advised
us
not
to
let
slip
this
advantage
,
but
clapping
between
them
and
*NL*
their
boats
,
deprive
them
of
the
capacity
of
ever
returning
to
plague
*NL*
the
island
:
_
I
know
_
,
said
he
,
_
there
is
but
on
objection
you
can
make
,
*NL*
which
is
,
that
these
creatures
,
living
like
beasts
in
the
wood
,
may
make
*NL*
excursions
,
rifle
the
plantations
,
and
destroy
the
tame
goats
;
but
then
,
*NL*
consider
,
we
had
better
to
do
with
an
hundred
men
whom
we
can
kill
,
or
*NL*
make
slaves
of
at
leisure
,
than
with
an
hundred
nations
,
whom
it
is
*NL*
impossible
we
should
save
ourselves
from
,
much
less
subdue
_
.
This
*NL*
advice
,
and
these
arguments
being
approved
of
,
we
set
fire
to
their
*NL*
boats
;
and
though
they
were
so
wet
that
we
could
not
burn
them
entirely
,
*NL*
yet
we
made
them
incapable
for
swimming
in
the
seas
.
As
soon
as
the
*NL*
Indians
perceived
what
we
were
doing
,
many
of
them
ran
out
of
the
woods
,
*NL*
in
fight
of
us
,
and
kneeling
down
,
piteously
cried
out
,
_
Oa
,
Oa
!
*NL*
Waramakoa
_
.
Intimating
,
I
suppose
,
that
,
if
we
would
but
spare
their
*NL*
canoes
,
they
would
never
trouble
us
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
their
complaints
,
submissions
,
and
entreaties
,
were
in
vain
;
*NL*
for
self-preservation
obliging
us
to
the
contrary
,
we
destroyed
every
*NL*
one
of
them
that
had
escaped
the
fury
of
the
ocean
.
When
the
Indians
*NL*
perceived
this
,
they
raised
a
lamentable
cry
,
and
ran
into
the
woods
,
*NL*
where
they
continued
ranging
about
;
making
the
woods
ring
with
their
*NL*
lamentation
.
Here
we
should
have
considered
,
that
making
these
*NL*
creatures
,
thus
desperate
,
we
ought
,
at
the
same
time
to
have
set
a
*NL*
sufficient
guard
upon
the
plantations
:
for
the
savages
,
in
their
ranging
*NL*
about
,
found
out
the
bower
,
destroyed
the
fences
,
trod
the
corn
down
*NL*
under
their
feet
,
and
tore
up
the
vines
and
grapes
.
It
is
true
,
we
were
*NL*
always
able
to
fight
these
creatures
;
but
,
as
they
were
too
swift
for
*NL*
us
,
and
very
numerous
,
we
durst
not
go
out
single
,
for
fear
of
them
;
*NL*
though
that
too
was
needless
,
they
having
no
weapons
,
nor
any
materials
*NL*
to
make
them
;
and
,
indeed
,
their
extremity
appeared
in
a
little
*NL*
time
after

Though
the
savages
,
as
already
mentioned
,
had
destroyed
our
bower
,
and
*NL*
all
our
corns
,
grapes
,
&
c.
yet
we
had
still
left
our
flock
of
cattle
in
*NL*
the
valley
,
by
the
cave
,
with
some
little
corn
that
grew
there
,
and
the
*NL*
plantation
of
Will
Atkins
and
his
companions
,
one
of
whom
being
killed
*NL*
by
an
arrow
,
they
were
now
reduced
to
two
:
it
is
remarkable
that
this
*NL*
was
the
fellow
who
cut
the
poor
Indian
with
his
hatchet
,
and
had
design
*NL*
to
murder
me
and
my
countrymen
the
Spaniards
.
As
our
condition
was
low
,
*NL*
we
came
to
the
resolution
to
drive
the
savages
up
to
the
farther
part
of
*NL*
the
island
,
where
no
Indians
landed
,
to
kill
as
many
of
them
as
we
*NL*
could
,
till
we
had
reduced
their
number
;
and
then
to
give
the
remainder
*NL*
some
corn
to
plant
,
and
to
teach
them
how
to
live
by
their
daily
labour
,
*NL*
accordingly
we
pursued
them
with
our
guns
,
at
the
hearing
of
which
they
*NL*
were
so
terrified
,
that
they
would
fall
to
the
ground
.
Every
day
we
*NL*
killed
and
wounded
some
of
them
,
and
many
were
found
starved
to
death
,
*NL*
so
that
our
hearts
began
to
relent
at
the
sight
of
such
miserable
*NL*
objects
.
At
last
,
with
great
difficulty
,
taking
one
of
them
alive
,
and
*NL*
using
him
with
kindness
,
&
tenderness
,
we
brought
him
to
Old
Friday
,
who
*NL*
talked
to
him
,
&
told
him
how
good
we
would
be
to
them
all
,
giving
them
*NL*
corn
and
land
to
plant
and
live
in
,
and
present
nourishment
,
provided
*NL*
they
should
keep
within
such
bounds
as
should
be
allotted
them
,
and
not
*NL*
do
prejudice
to
others
:
_
Go
then
_
,
said
he
,
_
and
inform
your
countrymen
*NL*
of
this
;
which
,
if
they
will
not
agree
to
,
every
one
of
them
shall
*NL*
be
slain

``
The
poor
creatures
,
thoroughly
humbled
,
being
reduced
to
about
*NL*
thirty-seven
,
joyfully
accepted
the
offer
,
and
earnestly
begged
for
*NL*
food
;
hereupon
we
sent
twelve
Spaniards
and
two
Englishmen
well
armed
,
*NL*
together
with
Old
Friday
,
and
three
Indian
slaves
were
loaded
with
a
*NL*
large
quantity
of
bread
and
rice
cakes
,
with
three
live
goats
:
and
the
*NL*
poor
Indians
being
ordered
to
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
hill
,
they
ate
*NL*
the
victuals
very
thankfully
,
and
have
proved
faithful
to
the
last
,
*NL*
never
trespassing
beyond
their
bounds
,
where
at
this
day
they
quietly
*NL*
and
happily
remain
,
and
where
we
now
and
then
visit
them
.
They
are
*NL*
confined
to
a
neck
of
land
about
a
mile
and
a
half
broad
,
and
three
or
*NL*
four
in
length
,
on
the
south-east
corner
of
the
island
,
the
sea
being
*NL*
before
,
and
lofty
mountains
behind
them
,
free
from
the
appearance
of
*NL*
canoes
;
and
indeed
their
countrymen
never
made
any
inquiry
after
them
.
*NL*
We
gave
them
twelve
hatchets
,
and
three
or
four
knives
;
have
taught
them
*NL*
to
build
huts
,
make
wooden
spades
,
plant
corn
,
make
bread
,
breed
tame
*NL*
goats
and
milk
them
,
as
likewise
to
make
wicker
work
,
in
which
I
must
*NL*
ingenuously
confess
,
they
infinitely
out
do
us
,
having
made
themselves
*NL*
several
pretty
necessaries
and
fancies
,
as
baskets
,
sieves
,
bird-cages
,
*NL*
and
cupboards
,
as
also
stools
,
beds
and
couches
,
no
less
useful
than
*NL*
delightful
;
and
now
they
live
the
most
innocent
and
inoffensive
*NL*
creatures
that
ever
were
subdued
in
the
world
,
wanting
nothing
but
wives
*NL*
to
make
them
a
nation
.

``
Thus

kind
Sir

have
I
given
you

according
to
my
ability

an
*NL*
impartial
account
of
the
various
transactions
that
have
happened
,
in
the
*NL*
island
since
your
departure
to
this
day
;
and
we
have
great
reason
to

acknowledge
the
kind
providence
of
Heaven
in
our
merciful
deliverance

When
you
inspect
your
little
kingdom

you
will
find
in
it
some
little

improvement

your
flocks
increased

and
your
subjects
augmented

so
that
*NL*
from
a
desolate
island
,
as
this
was
before
your
wonderful
deliverance

upon
it

here
is
a

its
becoming
a

well

little

to
your
immortal
fame

*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
doubt
to
suppose
but
that
the
preceeding
relation
of
my
*NL*
faithful
Spaniard
was
very
agreeable
and
no
less
surprising
to
me
,
to
*NL*
the
young
priest
,
and
to
all
who
heard
it
:
now
were
these
people
less
*NL*
pleased
with
those
necessary
utensils
that
I
brought
them
,
such
as
the
*NL*
knives
,
scissars
,
spades
,
shovels
,
and
pick-axes
,
with
which
they
now
*NL*
adorn
their
habitations
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
had
they
addicted
themselves
to
wicker-work
,
prompted
by
the
*NL*
ingenuity
of
the
Indians
,
who
assisted
them
,
that
when
I
viewed
the
*NL*
Englishmen
's
colonies
,
they
seemed
at
a
distance
as
though
they
had
*NL*
lived
like
bees
in
a
hive
:
for
Will
Atkins
,
who
was
now
become
a
very
*NL*
industrious
and
sober
man
,
had
made
himself
a
tent
of
basket-work
round
*NL*
the
outside
;
the
walls
were
worked
in
as
a
basket
,
in
pannels
or
strong
*NL*
squares
of
thirty-two
in
number
,
standing
about
seven
feet
high
:
in
the
*NL*
middle
was
another
,
not
above
twenty-two
paces
round
,
but
much
stronger
*NL*
built
,
being
of
an
octagonal
form
,
and
in
the
eight
corners
stood
eight
*NL*
strong
poles
,
round
the
top
of
which
he
raised
a
pyramid
for
the
roof
,
*NL*
mighty
pretty
,
I
assure
you
,
and
joined
very
well
together
,
with
iron
*NL*
spikes
,
which
he
made
himself
;
for
he
had
made
him
a
forge
,
with
a
pair
*NL*
of
wooden
bellows
and
charcoal
for
his
work
,
forming
an
anvil
cut
of
one
*NL*
of
the
iron
crows
,
to
work
upon
,
and
in
the
manner
would
he
make
himself
*NL*
hooks
,
staples
,
spikes
,
bolts
,
and
hinges
.
After
he
had
pitched
the
roof
*NL*
of
his
innermost
tent
,
he
made
it
so
firm
between
the
rafters
with
*NL*
basket-work
,
thatching
that
over
again
with
rice-straw
,
and
over
that
a
*NL*
large
leaf
of
a
tree
,
that
his
house
was
as
dry
as
if
it
had
been
tiled
*NL*
or
slated
.
The
outer
circuit
was
covered
as
a
lean-to
,
quite
round
this
*NL*
inner
appartment
,
laying
long
rafters
from
the
thirty-two
angles
to
the
*NL*
top
posts
of
the
inner
house
,
about
twenty-feet
distant
,
so
that
there
*NL*
was
a
space
like
a
wall
between
the
outer
and
inner
wall
,
near
twenty
*NL*
feet
in
breadth
.
The
inner
place
he
partitioned
off
with
the
same
*NL*
wicker-work
,
dividing
it
into
six
neat
apartments
every
one
of
which
had
*NL*
a
door
,
first
into
the
entry
of
the
main
tent
,
and
another
into
the
*NL*
space
and
walk
that
was
round
it
,
not
only
convenient
for
retreat
,
but
*NL*
for
family
necessaries
.
Within
the
door
of
the
outer
circle
,
there
was
*NL*
a
passage
directly
to
the
door
of
the
inner
house
;
on
either
side
was
a
*NL*
wicker
partition
,
and
a
door
,
by
which
you
go
into
a
room
twenty-two
*NL*
feet
wide
,
and
about
thirty
long
,
and
through
that
into
another
of
a
*NL*
smaller
length
;
so
that
in
the
outer
circle
were
ten
handsome
rooms
,
six
*NL*
of
which
were
only
to
be
come
at
through
the
apartments
of
the
inner
*NL*
tent
,
serving
as
retiring
rooms
to
the
respective
chambers
of
the
inner
*NL*
circle
,
and
four
large
warehouses
,
which
went
in
through
one
another
,
*NL*
two
on
either
hand
of
the
passage
that
led
through
the
outer
door
to
the
*NL*
inner
tent
.
In
short
,
nothing
could
be
built
more
ingeniously
,
kept
more
*NL*
neat
,
or
have
better
conveniences
;
and
here
lived
the
three
families
,
*NL*
Will
Atkins
,
his
companion
,
their
wives
and
children
,
and
the
widow
of
*NL*
the
deceased
.
As
to
religion
,
the
men
seldom
taught
their
wives
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
God
,
any
more
than
the
sailors
'
custom
of
swearing
by
his
*NL*
name
.
The
greatest
improvement
their
wives
had
,
was
,
they
taught
them
to
*NL*
speak
English
,
so
as
to
be
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
their
children
were
then
above
six
years
old
;
they
were
all
*NL*
fruitful
enough
;
and
I
think
the
cook
's
mate
's
wife
was
big
of
her
*NL*
sixth
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
inquired
of
the
Spaniards
about
their
circumstances
while
among
*NL*
the
savages
,
they
told
me
,
_
that
they
abandoned
themselves
to
despair
,
*NL*
reckoning
themselves
a
poor
and
miserable
people
,
that
had
no
means
put
*NL*
into
their
hands
,
and
consequently
must
soon
be
starved
to
death
.
_
They
*NL*
owned
,
however
,
that
they
were
in
the
wrong
to
think
so
,
and
for
*NL*
refusing
the
assistance
that
reason
offered
for
their
support
,
as
well
*NL*
as
future
deliverance
,
confessing
that
grief
was
a
most
insignificant
*NL*
passion
,
as
it
looked
upon
things
as
without
remedy
,
and
having
no
hope
*NL*
of
things
to
come
;
all
which
verified
this
noted
proverb
,
*NL*
*NL*
_
In
trouble
to
be
troubled
,
*NL*
Is
to
have
your
trouble
doubled
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
his
remarks
end
here
,
for
,
making
observations
upon
my
*NL*
improvement
,
and
on
my
condition
at
first
,
infinitely
worse
than
theirs
,
*NL*
he
told
me
that
Englishmen
had
,
in
their
distress
,
greater
presence
of
*NL*
mind
than
those
of
any
other
country
that
he
had
met
with
;
and
that
they
*NL*
and
the
Portuguese
were
the
worst
men
in
the
world
to
struggle
under
*NL*
misfortunes
.
When
they
landed
among
the
savages
,
they
found
but
little
*NL*
provision
except
they
would
turn
cannibals
,
there
being
but
a
few
roots
*NL*
and
herbs
,
with
little
substance
in
them
,
and
of
which
the
natives
gave
*NL*
them
but
very
sparingly
.
Many
were
the
ways
they
took
to
civilize
and
*NL*
teach
the
savages
,
but
in
vain
;
for
they
would
not
own
them
to
be
their
*NL*
instructors
,
whose
lives
were
owing
to
their
bounty
.
Their
extremities
*NL*
were
very
great
and
many
days
being
entirely
without
food
,
the
savages
*NL*
there
being
more
indolent
and
less
devouring
than
those
who
had
better
*NL*
supplies
.
When
they
went
out
to
battle
they
were
obliged
to
assist
these
*NL*
people
,
in
one
of
which
my
faithful
Spaniard
being
taken
,
had
like
to
*NL*
have
been
devoured
.
They
had
lost
their
ammunition
,
which
rendered
their
*NL*
fire-arms
useless
;
nor
could
they
use
the
bows
and
arrows
that
were
*NL*
given
them
,
so
that
while
the
armies
were
at
a
distance
,
they
had
no
*NL*
chance
but
when
close
,
then
they
could
be
of
service
with
halberts
,
&
*NL*
sharpened
sticks
put
into
the
muzzles
of
their
muskets
.
They
made
*NL*
themselves
targets
of
wood
covered
with
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
;
and
*NL*
when
one
happened
to
be
knocked
down
,
the
rest
of
the
company
fought
*NL*
over
him
till
he
recovered
;
and
then
standing
close
in
a
line
,
they
*NL*
would
make
their
way
through
a
thousand
savages
.
At
the
return
of
their
*NL*
friend
,
who
they
thought
had
been
entombed
in
the
bowels
of
their
*NL*
enemies
,
their
joy
was
inconceivable
.
Nor
were
they
less
surprised
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
loaves
of
bread
I
had
sent
them
,
things
that
they
had
*NL*
not
seen
for
several
years
,
at
the
same
time
crossing
and
blessing
it
,
*NL*
as
though
it
was
manna
sent
from
Heaven
:
but
when
they
knew
the
errand
,
*NL*
and
perceived
the
boat
which
was
to
carry
them
back
to
the
person
and
*NL*
place
from
whence
such
relief
came
,
this
struck
them
with
such
a
*NL*
surprise
of
joy
as
made
some
of
them
faint
away
,
and
others
burst
out
*NL*
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
summary
account
that
I
had
from
them
.
I
shall
now
inform
*NL*
the
reader
what
I
next
did
for
them
,
and
in
what
condition
I
left
them
.
*NL*
As
we
were
all
of
opinion
that
the
savages
would
scarce
trouble
them
any
*NL*
more
,
so
we
had
no
apprehensions
on
the
score
.
I
told
them
I
was
come
*NL*
purely
to
establish
,
and
not
to
remove
them
;
and
upon
that
occasion
,
had
*NL*
not
only
brought
them
necessaries
for
convenience
and
defence
,
but
also
*NL*
artificers
,
and
other
persons
,
both
for
their
necessary
employments
,
and
*NL*
to
add
to
their
number
.
They
were
altogether
when
I
thus
talked
to
them
;
*NL*
and
before
I
delivered
to
them
the
stores
I
brought
,
I
asked
them
,
one
*NL*
by
one
,
if
they
had
entirely
forgot
their
first
animosities
,
would
*NL*
engage
in
the
strictest
friendship
;
and
shake
hands
with
one
another
?
On
*NL*
this
Will
Atkins
,
with
abundance
of
good
humour
,
said
,
_
they
had
*NL*
afflictions
enough
to
make
them
all
sober
,
and
enemies
enough
to
make
*NL*
them
all
friends
:
as
for
himself
,
he
would
live
and
die
among
them
,
*NL*
owning
that
what
the
Spaniards
had
done
to
him
,
his
own
mad
humour
had
*NL*
made
necessary
for
them
to
do
_
.
Nor
had
the
Spaniards
occasion
to
*NL*
justify
their
proceeding
to
me
;
but
they
told
me
,
_
that
since
Will
*NL*
Atkins
had
behaved
himself
so
valiantly
in
fight
,
and
at
other
times
*NL*
showed
such
a
regard
to
the
common
interest
of
them
all
,
they
had
not
*NL*
only
forgotten
all
that
was
past
,
but
thought
he
ought
as
much
to
be
*NL*
trusted
with
arms
and
necessaries
as
any
of
them
,
which
they
testified
*NL*
by
making
him
next
in
command
to
the
governor
:
and
they
most
heartily
*NL*
embraced
the
occasion
of
giving
me
this
solemn
assurance
,
that
they
*NL*
would
never
separate
their
interest
again
,
as
long
as
they
lived
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
kind
declarations
of
friendship
,
we
appointed
all
of
us
to
*NL*
dine
together
the
next
day
;
upon
this
I
caused
the
ship
's
cook
and
his
*NL*
mate
to
come
on
shore
for
that
purpose
,
to
assist
in
dressing
our
*NL*
dinner
.
We
brought
from
the
ship
six
pieces
of
beef
,
and
four
of
pork
,
*NL*
together
with
our
punch
bowl
,
and
materials
to
fill
it
;
and
in
*NL*
particular
I
gave
them
ten
bottles
of
French
claret
,
and
ten
of
English
*NL*
beer
,
which
was
very
acceptable
to
them
.
The
Spaniards
added
to
our
*NL*
feast
,
five
whose
kids
,
which
being
roasted
,
three
of
them
were
sent
as
*NL*
fresh
meat
to
the
sailors
on
board
,
and
the
other
two
we
ate
ourselves
.
*NL*
After
our
merry
and
innocent
feast
was
over
,
I
began
to
distribute
my
*NL*
cargo
among
them
.
First
,
I
gave
them
linen
sufficient
to
make
every
one
*NL*
four
shirts
,
and
at
the
Spaniard
's
request
made
them
up
six
.
The
thin
*NL*
English
stuffs
I
allotted
to
make
every
one
a
light
coat
like
a
frock
,
*NL*
agreeable
to
the
climate
,
and
left
them
such
a
quantity
as
to
make
more
*NL*
upon
their
decay
;
as
also
pumps
,
shoes
,
hats
,
and
stockings
.
It
is
not
*NL*
to
be
expressed
the
pleasing
satisfaction
which
sat
upon
the
*NL*
countenances
of
these
poor
men
,
when
they
perceived
what
care
I
took
of
*NL*
them
,
as
if
I
had
been
a
common
father
to
them
all
;
and
they
all
engaged
*NL*
never
to
leave
the
island
,
till
I
gave
my
consent
for
their
departure
.
I
*NL*
then
presented
to
them
the
people
I
brought
,
viz
.
the
tailor
,
smith
,
and
*NL*
the
two
carpenters
;
but
my
Jack-of-all-trades
was
the
most
acceptable
*NL*
present
I
could
make
them
.
My
tailor
fell
immediately
to
work
,
and
made
*NL*
every
one
of
them
a
shirt
;
after
which
,
he
learned
the
women
how
to
sew
*NL*
and
stitch
,
thereby
to
become
the
more
helpful
to
their
husbands
.
*NL*
Neither
were
the
carpenters
less
useful
,
taking
in
pieces
their
clumsy
*NL*
things
;
instead
of
which
they
made
convenient
and
handsome
tables
,
*NL*
stools
,
bedsteads
,
cupboards
,
lockers
,
and
shelves
.
But
when
I
carried
*NL*
them
to
see
Will
Atkins
's
basket-house
,
they
owned
they
never
saw
such
a
*NL*
piece
of
natural
ingenuity
before
:
_
I
am
sure
,
_
said
one
of
the
*NL*
carpenters
,
_
the
man
that
built
this
has
no
need
of
us
;
you
need
,
Sir
,
*NL*
do
nothing
but
give
him
tools
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
I
divided
the
tools
among
them
in
this
manner
:
to
every
man
I
gave
a
*NL*
digging
spade
,
a
shovel
,
and
a
rake
,
as
having
no
harrows
or
ploughs
;
*NL*
and
to
every
separate
place
a
pickax
,
a
crow
,
a
broad
ax
,
and
a
saw
,
*NL*
with
a
store
for
a
general
supply
,
should
any
be
broken
or
worn
out
.
I
*NL*
left
them
also
nails
,
staples
,
hinges
,
hammers
,
chisels
,
knives
,
*NL*
scissors
,
and
all
sorts
of
tools
and
iron
work
;
&
for
the
use
of
the
*NL*
smith
,
gave
them
three
tons
of
unwrought
iron
,
for
a
supply
;
and
as
to
*NL*
arms
and
ammunition
,
I
stored
them
even
to
profusion
;
or
at
least
to
*NL*
equip
a
sufficient
little
army
against
all
opposers
whatsoever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
-LRB-
whose
mother
was
unfortunately
starved
to
death
-RRB-
together
*NL*
with
the
maid
,
a
pious
and
well
educated
young
woman
,
seeing
things
so
*NL*
well
ordered
on
shore
-LRB-
for
I
made
them
accompany
me
-RRB-
and
considering
*NL*
they
had
no
occasion
to
go
so
far
a
voyage
as
to
the
East
Indies
,
they
*NL*
both
desired
of
me
,
that
I
would
leave
them
there
,
and
enter
them
among
*NL*
my
subjects
.
This
I
readily
agreed
to
,
ordering
them
a
plat
of
ground
,
*NL*
on
which
were
three
little
houses
erected
,
environed
with
basket-work
,
*NL*
pallisadoed
like
Atkins
's
and
adjoining
to
his
plantation
.
So
contrived
*NL*
were
their
tents
that
each
of
them
had
a
room
apart
to
lodge
in
,
while
*NL*
the
middle
tent
was
not
only
their
store-house
,
but
their
place
for
*NL*
eating
and
drinking
.
At
this
time
the
two
Englishmen
removed
their
*NL*
habitation
to
their
former
place
;
in
that
now
the
island
was
divided
*NL*
into
three
colonies
:
first
,
Those
I
have
just
now
mentioned
;
secondly
*NL*
That
of
Will
Atkins
,
where
there
were
four
families
of
Englishmen
,
with
*NL*
their
wives
and
children
,
the
widow
and
her
children
;
the
young
man
and
*NL*
the
maid
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
we
made
a
wife
of
before
our
departure
;
three
*NL*
savages
,
who
were
slaves
;
the
tailor
,
smith
,
-LRB-
who
served
also
as
a
*NL*
gunsmith
-RRB-
and
my
other
celebrated
person
called
Jack-of-all-trades
.
*NL*
Thirdly
,
my
chief
colony
,
which
consisted
of
the
Spaniards
,
with
Old
*NL*
Friday
,
who
still
remained
at
my
old
habitation
,
which
was
my
capital
*NL*
city
,
and
surely
never
was
there
such
a
metropolis
,
it
now
being
hid
in
*NL*
so
obscure
a
grove
,
that
a
thousand
men
might
have
ranged
the
island
a
*NL*
month
,
and
looked
purposely
for
it
,
without
being
able
to
find
it
,
*NL*
though
the
Spaniards
had
enlarged
its
boundaries
,
both
without
and
*NL*
within
,
in
a
most
surprising
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
I
think
it
high
time
to
speak
of
the
young
French
priest
of
the
*NL*
order
of
St.
Benedict
,
whose
judicious
and
pious
discourses
,
upon
sundry
*NL*
occasions
,
merit
an
extraordinary
observation
;
nor
can
his
being
a
*NL*
French
Papist
priest
,
I
presume
,
give
offence
to
any
of
my
readers
,
when
*NL*
they
have
this
assurance
from
me
,
that
he
was
a
person
of
the
most
*NL*
courteous
disposition
,
extensive
charity
,
and
exalted
piety
.
His
*NL*
arguments
were
always
agreeable
to
reason
,
and
his
conversation
the
most
*NL*
acceptable
of
any
person
that
I
had
ever
yet
met
with
in
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Sir
,
_
said
he
,
to
me
,
one
day
,
_
since
,
under
God
,
_
at
the
same
time
*NL*
crossing
his
breast
,
_
you
have
not
only
saved
my
life
;
but
,
by
*NL*
permitting
me
to
go
this
voyage
,
have
granted
me
the
happiness
of
free
*NL*
conversation
,
I
think
is
my
duty
as
my
profession
obliges
me
,
to
save
*NL*
what
souls
I
can
,
by
bringing
them
to
the
knowledge
of
some
Catholic
*NL*
doctrine
,
necessary
to
salvation
;
and
since
these
people
are
under
your
*NL*
immediate
government
,
in
gratitude
,
justice
,
and
decency
,
for
what
you
*NL*
have
done
for
me
,
I
shall
offer
no
farther
points
in
religion
,
that
what
*NL*
shall
merit
your
approbation
_
.
Being
a-pleased
with
the
modesty
of
his
*NL*
carriage
,
I
told
him
he
should
not
be
worse
used
for
being
of
a
*NL*
different
persuasion
,
if
upon
that
very
account
,
we
did
not
differ
in
*NL*
points
of
faith
,
not
decent
in
a
part
of
the
country
where
the
poor
*NL*
Indians
ought
to
be
instructed
in
the
knowledge
of
the
true
God
,
and
his
*NL*
Son
Jesus
Christ
.
To
this
he
replied
,
that
conversation
might
easily
be
*NL*
separated
from
disputes
;
that
he
would
discourse
with
me
rather
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
than
a
religious
:
but
that
,
if
we
did
enter
upon
religious
*NL*
argument
,
upon
my
desiring
the
same
,
I
would
give
him
liberty
to
defend
*NL*
his
own
principles
.
He
farther
added
,
that
he
would
do
all
that
became
*NL*
him
in
his
office
,
as
a
priest
as
well
as
a
Christian
,
to
procure
the
*NL*
happiness
of
all
that
were
in
the
ship
:
that
though
he
could
not
pray
*NL*
with
,
he
would
pray
for
us
on
all
occasions
;
and
then
he
told
me
several
*NL*
extraordinary
events
of
his
life
,
within
a
few
years
past
;
but
*NL*
particularly
in
this
last
,
which
was
the
most
remarkable
:
that
,
in
this
*NL*
voyage
,
he
had
the
misfortune
to
be
five
times
shipped
and
unshipped
:
*NL*
his
first
design
was
to
have
gone
to
Martinico
;
for
which
,
taking
ship
*NL*
at
St.
Malos
,
he
was
forced
into
Lisbon
by
bad
weather
,
the
vessel
*NL*
running
aground
in
the
mouth
of
the
Tagus
;
that
from
thence
he
went
on
*NL*
board
a
Portuguese
ship
,
bound
to
the
Madeiras
,
whose
master
being
but
*NL*
an
indifferent
mariner
,
and
out
of
his
reckoning
,
they
were
drove
to
*NL*
Fial
,
where
selling
their
commodity
,
which
was
corn
,
they
resolved
to
*NL*
take
in
their
loading
at
the
Isle
of
May
,
and
to
sail
to
Newfoundland
;
*NL*
at
the
banks
of
which
,
meeting
a
French
ship
bound
to
Quebec
,
in
the
*NL*
river
of
Canada
,
and
from
thence
to
Martinico
,
in
this
ship
he
embarked
;
*NL*
the
master
of
which
dying
at
Quebec
,
that
voyage
was
suspended
;
and
*NL*
lastly
,
shipping
himself
for
France
,
this
last
ship
was
destroyed
by
*NL*
fire
,
as
before
has
been
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
we
talked
no
further
;
but
another
morning
he
comes
to
me
,
*NL*
just
as
I
was
going
to
visit
the
Englishman
's
colony
,
and
tells
me
,
that
*NL*
as
he
knew
;
the
prosperity
of
the
island
,
was
my
principal
desire
,
he
*NL*
had
something
to
communicate
agreeable
to
my
design
,
by
which
perhaps
he
*NL*
might
put
it
,
more
than
he
yet
thought
it
was
,
in
the
way
of
the
*NL*
benediction
of
heaven
.
_
How
,
Sir
,
_
said
I
,
in
a
surprise
,
_
are
we
not
*NL*
yet
in
the
way
of
God
's
blessings
,
after
all
these
signal
providences
*NL*
and
deliverances
,
of
which
you
have
had
such
an
ample
relation
?
_
He
*NL*
replied
,
_
Nope
,
Sir
,
you
are
in
the
way
,
and
that
your
good
design
will
*NL*
prosper
:
but
still
there
are
some
among
you
that
are
not
equally
right
*NL*
in
their
actions
;
and
remember
,
I
beseech
you
,
Sir
,
that
Achan
,
by
his
*NL*
crime
,
removed
God
's
blessing
from
the
camp
of
the
children
of
Israel
;
*NL*
that
though
six
and
thirty
where
entirely
innocent
,
yet
they
became
the
*NL*
object
of
divine
vengeance
,
and
bore
the
weight
of
his
punishment
*NL*
accordingly
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
So
sensibly
was
I
touched
with
this
discourse
,
and
so
satisfied
with
*NL*
that
ardent
piety
that
inflamed
his
soul
,
that
I
desired
him
to
*NL*
accompany
me
to
the
Englishman
's
plantations
,
which
he
was
very
glad
of
,
*NL*
by
reason
they
were
the
subject
of
what
he
designed
to
discourse
with
me
*NL*
about
:
and
while
we
walked
on
together
,
he
began
in
the
*NL*
following
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
said
he
,
I
must
confess
it
as
a
great
unhappiness
that
we
disagree
*NL*
in
several
doctrinal
articles
of
religion
;
but
surely
both
of
us
*NL*
acknowledge
this
,
that
there
is
a
God
,
who
having
given
us
some
stated
*NL*
rules
for
our
service
and
obedience
,
we
ought
not
willingly
and
*NL*
knowingly
to
offend
him
;
either
by
neglecting
what
he
has
commanded
,
or
*NL*
by
doing
what
he
has
forbidden
.
This
truth
every
Christian
owns
,
that
*NL*
when
any
one
presumptuously
sins
against
God
's
command
,
the
Almighty
*NL*
then
withdraws
his
blessing
from
him
;
every
good
man
therefore
ought
*NL*
certainly
to
prevent
such
neglect
of
,
or
sin
against
,
God
and
his
*NL*
commands
.
''
I
thanked
the
young
priest
for
expressing
so
great
a
concern
*NL*
for
us
,
and
desired
him
to
explain
the
particulars
of
what
he
had
*NL*
observed
,
that
according
to
the
parable
of
Achan
,
I
_
might
remove
the
*NL*
accursed
thing
from
among
us
_
``
Why
then
,
Sir
,
said
he
,
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
you
have
four
Englishmen
,
who
have
taken
savage
women
to
their
*NL*
wives
,
by
whom
they
have
several
children
,
though
none
of
them
are
*NL*
legally
married
,
as
the
law
of
God
and
man
requires
;
they
,
I
say
,
Sir
,
*NL*
are
no
less
than
adulterers
,
and
as
they
still
live
in
adultery
,
are
*NL*
liable
to
the
curse
of
God
.
I
know
,
Sir
,
you
may
object
the
want
of
a
*NL*
priest
or
clergyman
of
any
kind
;
as
also
,
pen
,
ink
and
paper
,
to
write
*NL*
down
a
contract
of
marriage
,
and
have
it
signed
between
them
.
But
*NL*
neither
this
,
nor
what
the
Spanish
governor
has
told
you
of
their
*NL*
choosing
by
consent
,
can
be
reckoned
a
marriage
,
nor
any
more
than
an
*NL*
agreement
to
keep
them
from
quarrelling
among
themselves
;
for
,
Sir
,
the
*NL*
essence
or
sacrament
of
matrimony
-LRB-
so
he
called
it
-RRB-
not
only
consists
in
*NL*
mutual
consent
,
but
in
the
legal
obligation
,
which
compels
them
to
own
*NL*
and
acknowledge
one
another
,
to
abstain
from
other
persons
,
the
men
to
*NL*
provide
for
their
wives
and
children
,
and
the
woman
to
the
same
and
like
*NL*
conditions
,
_
nutatis
mutandis
,
_
on
their
side
:
whereas
,
Sir
,
these
men
,
*NL*
upon
their
own
pleasure
,
on
any
occasion
,
may
forsake
those
women
and
*NL*
marry
others
,
and
by
disowning
their
children
,
suffer
them
utterly
to
*NL*
perish
.
Now
,
Sir
,
`
added
he
,
`
can
God
be
honoured
in
such
an
unlawful
*NL*
liberty
as
this
;
how
can
a
blessing
succeed
to
the
best
endeavours
,
if
*NL*
men
are
allowed
to
live
in
so
licentious
a
way
?
''
I
was
indeed
struck
*NL*
with
the
thing
myself
,
and
thought
that
they
were
much
to
blame
,
that
no
*NL*
formal
contract
had
been
made
,
though
it
had
been
but
breaking
a
stick
*NL*
between
them
,
to
engage
them
to
live
as
man
and
wife
,
never
to
separate
,
*NL*
but
love
,
cherish
,
and
comfort
one
another
all
their
lives
;
_
yet
Sir
,
_
*NL*
said
I
,
_
when
they
took
these
wommen
,
I
was
not
here
,
and
if
it
is
*NL*
adultery
,
it
is
past
my
remedy
,
and
I
can
not
help
it
_
.
``
True
,
Sir
,
'
*NL*
answered
the
young
priest
,
you
can
not
be
charged
with
that
part
of
the
*NL*
crime
which
was
done
in
your
absence
:
but
I
beseech
you
,
do
n't
flatter
*NL*
yourself
,
that
you
are
under
no
obligation
now
to
put
a
period
to
it
:
*NL*
which
if
you
neglect
to
do
,
the
guilt
will
be
entirely
on
you
alone
,
*NL*
since
it
is
certainly
in
nobody
's
power
but
yours
,
to
alter
their
*NL*
condition
.
''
I
must
confess
,
I
was
so
dull
,
that
I
thought
he
meant
,
I
*NL*
should
part
them
,
and
knowing
that
this
would
put
the
whole
island
in
*NL*
confusion
,
I
told
him
,
I
could
not
consent
to
it
upon
any
account
*NL*
whatsoever
.
``
Sir
,
'
said
he
,
in
a
great
surprise
,
'
I
do
not
mean
that
you
*NL*
should
separate
,
but
marry
them
,
by
a
written
contract
,
signed
by
both
*NL*
man
and
woman
,
and
by
all
the
witnesses
present
,
which
all
the
European
*NL*
laws
decree
to
be
of
sufficient
efficacy
.
''
Amazed
with
such
true
piety
*NL*
and
sincerity
,
and
considering
the
validity
of
a
written
contract
,
I
*NL*
acknowledged
all
that
he
said
to
be
very
just
and
kind
,
and
that
I
would
*NL*
discourse
with
the
man
about
it
;
neither
could
I
see
what
reason
they
*NL*
could
have
not
to
let
him
marry
them
,
whose
authority
in
that
affair
is
*NL*
owned
to
be
as
authentic
as
if
they
were
married
by
any
of
our
clergymen
*NL*
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
complaint
he
had
to
make
to
me
was
this
,
that
though
these
*NL*
English
subjects
of
mine
have
lived
with
these
women
seven
years
,
and
*NL*
though
they
were
of
good
understanding
,
and
capable
of
instruction
,
*NL*
having
learned
not
only
to
speak
,
but
to
read
English
,
yet
all
this
*NL*
while
they
had
never
taught
them
any
thing
of
the
Christian
religion
,
or
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
God
,
much
less
in
what
manner
he
ought
to
be
served
.
*NL*
``
And
is
not
this
an
unaccountable
neglect
:
'
said
he
warmly
.
`
Depend
upon
*NL*
it
,
God
Almighty
will
call
them
to
account
for
such
contempt
.
And
though
*NL*
I
am
not
of
your
religion
,
yet
I
should
be
glad
to
see
these
people
*NL*
released
from
the
devil
's
power
,
and
be
saved
by
the
principles
of
the
*NL*
Christian
religion
,
the
knowledge
of
God
,
of
a
Redeemer
,
the
*NL*
resurrection
,
and
of
a
future
state
.
But
as
it
is
not
too
late
,
if
you
*NL*
please
to
give
me
leave
to
instruct
them
,
I
doubt
not
but
I
shall
supply
*NL*
this
great
defect
,
by
bringing
them
into
the
great
circle
of
*NL*
Christianity
,
even
while
you
continue
in
the
island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hold
no
longer
,
but
embracing
him
,
told
him
,
with
a
thousand
*NL*
thanks
,
I
would
grant
whatever
he
requested
,
and
desired
him
to
proceed
*NL*
in
the
third
article
,
which
he
did
in
the
following
manner
;
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
'
said
he
,
`
it
should
be
a
maxim
among
all
Christians
,
that
*NL*
Christian
knowledge
ought
to
be
propagated
by
all
possible
means
,
and
on
*NL*
all
occasion
.
Upon
this
account
our
church
sends
missionaries
into
*NL*
Persia
,
India
,
and
China
,
men
who
are
willing
to
die
for
the
sake
of
God
*NL*
&
the
Christian
faith
,
in
order
to
bring
poor
infidels
into
the
way
of
*NL*
salvation
.
Now
,
Sir
,
as
here
is
an
opportunity
to
convert
seven
&
thirty
*NL*
poor
savages
,
I
wonder
how
you
can
pass
by
such
an
occasion
of
doing
*NL*
good
,
which
is
really
worth
the
expence
of
a
man
's
whole
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
confess
I
was
so
confounded
at
this
discourse
,
that
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
how
to
answer
him
.
``
Sir
,
'
said
he
,
feeling
me
in
disorder
,
'
I
shall
*NL*
be
very
sorry
if
I
have
given
you
offence
.
''
_
No
Sir
,
_
said
I
,
_
I
am
*NL*
rather
confounded
;
and
you
know
my
circumstances
,
that
being
bound
to
*NL*
the
East
Indies
in
a
merchant
ship
,
I
can
not
wrong
the
owners
so
much
,
*NL*
as
to
detain
the
ship
here
,
the
men
lying
at
victuals
and
savages
on
*NL*
their
account
.
If
I
stay
aboard
several
days
,
I
must
pay
3l
.
sterling
_
*NL*
per
diem
_
demurage
,
nor
must
the
ship
stop
above
eight
days
more
;
so
*NL*
that
I
am
unable
to
engage
in
this
work
,
unless
I
would
leave
the
ship
,
*NL*
and
be
reduced
to
my
former
condition
.
_
The
priest
,
though
he
owned
this
*NL*
was
hard
upon
me
,
yet
laid
it
to
my
conscience
,
whether
the
blessing
of
*NL*
saving
seven
and
thirty
souls
was
not
worth
venturing
all
that
I
had
in
*NL*
the
world
?
_
Sir
,
_
said
I
,
_
it
is
very
true
;
but
as
you
are
an
*NL*
ecclesiastic
,
it
naturally
falls
into
your
profession
:
why
,
therefore
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
rather
offer
to
undertake
it
yourself
than
press
me
to
it
?
_
*NL*
upon
this
he
turned
about
,
making
a
very
low
bow
,
``
I
most
humbly
thank
*NL*
God
and
you
,
Sir
,
-LRB-
said
he
-RRB-
for
so
blessed
a
call
;
and
most
willingly
*NL*
undertake
so
glorious
an
office
,
which
will
sufficiently
compensate
all
*NL*
the
hazards
and
difficulties
I
have
gone
through
in
a
long
and
*NL*
uncomfortable
voyage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
thus
speaking
,
I
could
discover
a
rapture
in
his
face
,
by
*NL*
his
colour
going
and
coming
;
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
sparkled
like
*NL*
fire
,
and
all
the
signs
of
the
most
zealous
transports
.
And
when
I
asked
*NL*
whether
he
was
in
earnest
?
_
Sir
,
_
said
he
,
_
it
was
to
preach
to
the
*NL*
Indians
I
consented
to
come
along
with
you
;
these
infidels
,
even
in
this
*NL*
little
island
,
are
infinitely
of
more
worth
than
my
poor
life
:
if
so
*NL*
that
I
should
prove
the
happy
instrument
of
saving
these
poor
creatures
'
*NL*
souls
,
I
care
not
if
I
never
see
my
native
country
again
.
One
thing
I
*NL*
only
beg
of
you
more
is
,
that
you
would
leave
Friday
with
me
,
to
be
my
*NL*
interpreter
,
without
whose
assistance
neither
of
us
will
understand
*NL*
each
other
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
This
request
very
sensibly
troubled
me
;
first
,
upon
Friday
's
being
bred
*NL*
a
Protestant
;
and
secondly
,
for
the
affection
I
bore
to
him
for
his
*NL*
fidelity
:
But
,
immediately
the
remembrance
of
Friday
's
father
coming
*NL*
into
my
head
,
I
recommended
him
to
him
as
having
learned
Spanish
,
which
*NL*
the
priest
also
understood
;
and
so
was
thoroughly
satisfied
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
Englishmen
,
after
I
had
told
them
what
necessary
*NL*
things
I
had
done
for
them
,
I
talked
to
them
of
the
scandalous
life
they
*NL*
led
,
told
them
what
notice
the
clergyman
had
taken
of
it
,
and
asked
them
*NL*
if
they
were
married
men
or
bachelors
?
They
answered
,
two
of
them
were
*NL*
widowers
,
and
the
other
three
single
men
.
But
,
said
I
,
with
what
*NL*
conscience
can
you
call
these
your
wives
,
by
whom
you
have
so
many
*NL*
children
,
and
yet
are
not
lawfully
married
?
They
all
said
that
they
took
*NL*
them
before
the
governor
as
such
,
having
nobody
else
to
marry
them
,
*NL*
which
they
thought
as
legal
,
as
if
they
had
had
a
parson
.
No
doubt
,
said
*NL*
I
,
but
in
the
eye
of
God
it
is
so
:
but
unless
I
am
assured
of
your
*NL*
honest
intent
,
never
to
desert
these
poor
creatures
,
I
can
do
nothing
*NL*
more
for
you
,
neither
can
you
expect
God
's
blessing
while
you
live
in
*NL*
such
an
open
course
of
adultery
.
Hereupon
,
Will
Atkins
,
who
spoke
for
*NL*
the
rest
,
told
me
`
That
they
believed
their
wives
the
most
innocent
and
*NL*
virtuous
creatures
in
the
world
;
that
they
would
never
forsake
them
*NL*
while
they
had
breath
;
and
that
,
if
there
was
a
clergyman
in
the
ship
,
*NL*
they
would
be
married
to
them
with
all
their
hearts
.
'
I
told
you
before
,
*NL*
said
I
,
that
I
have
a
minister
with
me
,
who
shall
marry
you
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
,
if
you
are
willing
;
so
I
would
have
you
consult
to-night
with
*NL*
the
rest
about
it
.
I
told
him
the
clergyman
was
a
Frenchman
,
and
knew
*NL*
not
a
word
of
English
,
but
that
I
would
act
as
clerk
between
them
.
And
*NL*
indeed
this
business
met
with
such
speedy
success
,
that
they
all
told
*NL*
me
,
in
a
few
minutes
after
,
`
that
they
were
ready
to
be
formally
married
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
pleased
;
'
with
which
informing
the
priest
,
he
was
*NL*
exceedingly
rejoiced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
now
remained
,
but
that
the
women
should
be
made
sensible
of
the
*NL*
meaning
of
the
thing
;
with
which
being
well
satisfied
,
they
with
their
*NL*
husbands
attended
at
my
apartment
the
next
morning
;
there
was
my
priest
,
*NL*
habited
in
a
black
vest
,
something
like
a
cassock
,
with
a
sash
round
it
;
*NL*
much
resembling
a
minister
,
and
I
was
his
interpreter
.
But
the
*NL*
seriousness
of
his
behaviour
,
and
the
scruples
he
made
of
marrying
the
*NL*
women
,
who
were
not
baptized
,
gave
them
,
an
exceeding
reverence
for
his
*NL*
person
:
nor
indeed
would
he
marry
them
at
all
,
till
he
obtained
my
*NL*
liberty
to
discourse
both
with
the
men
and
women
,
and
then
he
told
them
,
*NL*
`
That
in
the
sight
of
all
indifferent
men
,
and
in
the
sense
of
the
laws
*NL*
of
society
,
they
had
lived
in
open
adultery
,
which
nothing
new
,
but
*NL*
their
consent
to
marry
,
or
final
separation
,
could
put
an
end
to
;
and
*NL*
even
here
was
a
difficulty
with
respect
to
the
laws
of
Christian
*NL*
matrimony
,
in
marrying
a
professed
Christian
to
a
heathen
idolater
,
*NL*
unbaptized
;
but
yet
there
was
time
enough
to
make
them
profess
the
name
*NL*
of
Christ
,
without
which
nothing
could
be
done
;
that
,
besides
,
he
*NL*
believed
themselves
very
indifferent
Christians
;
and
consequently
had
*NL*
not
discoursed
with
their
wives
upon
that
subject
;
and
that
unless
they
*NL*
promised
him
to
do
so
,
he
could
not
marry
them
,
as
being
expressly
*NL*
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
God
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
they
heard
attentively
,
and
owned
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
But
,
Lord
,
Sir
,
_
said
Will
Atkins
to
me
_
how
could
we
teach
them
*NL*
religion
,
who
know
nothing
of
it
ourselves
?
How
can
we
talk
to
our
wives
*NL*
of
God
,
Jesus
Christ
,
heaven
,
and
hell
?
Why
they
would
only
laugh
at
us
,
*NL*
who
never
yet
have
practiced
religion
,
but
on
the
contrary
all
manner
of
*NL*
wickedness
.
Will
Atkins
,
_
said
I
,
_
can
not
you
tell
your
wife
she
is
in
*NL*
the
wrong
,
and
that
her
gods
are
idols
,
which
can
neither
speak
nor
*NL*
understand
;
but
that
our
God
,
who
has
made
,
can
destroy
all
things
;
that
*NL*
he
rewards
the
good
and
punishes
the
wicked
;
and
at
last
will
bring
us
*NL*
to
judgment
;
can
not
you
tell
her
these
things
?
That
's
true
,
_
said
*NL*
Atkins
,
_
but
then
she
'll
tell
me
it
is
utterly
false
,
since
I
am
not
*NL*
punished
and
sent
to
the
devil
,
who
hath
been
such
a
wicked
creature
.
_
*NL*
These
words
I
interpreted
to
the
priest
.
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
,
``
tell
him
,
his
*NL*
repentance
will
make
him
a
very
good
minister
to
his
spouse
,
and
qualify
*NL*
him
to
preach
on
the
mercy
and
long
suffering
of
a
merciful
Being
,
who
*NL*
desires
not
the
death
of
a
sinner
,
and
even
defers
damnation
to
the
last
*NL*
judgment
;
this
will
lead
him
to
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
and
*NL*
will
make
him
an
excellent
preacher
to
his
wife
.
''
I
repeated
this
to
*NL*
Atkins
,
who
being
more
than
ordinary
affected
with
it
,
replied
,
_
I
know
*NL*
all
this
,
Sir
,
and
a
great
deal
more
;
but
how
can
I
have
the
impudence
*NL*
to
talk
thus
to
my
wife
,
given
my
conscience
witnesses
against
me
?
*NL*
Alas
!
_
said
he
-LRB-
with
tears
in
his
eye
,
and
giving
a
great
sigh
-RRB-
_
as
for
*NL*
repenting
,
that
is
for
ever
past
me
.
Past
you
!
Atkins
,
_
said
I
,
_
what
do
*NL*
you
mean
?
You
know
well
enough
,
_
said
he
,
_
what
I
mean
,
I
mean
it
is
*NL*
too
late
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
told
the
priest
what
he
said
,
the
poor
affectionate
man
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
weeping
;
but
recovering
himself
``
Pray
,
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
ask
*NL*
him
if
he
is
contented
that
it
is
too
late
;
or
is
he
concerned
,
and
*NL*
wishes
it
were
not
so
?
''
This
question
I
put
fairly
to
Atkins
,
who
*NL*
replied
in
a
passion
,
_
How
can
I
be
easy
in
a
state
which
I
know
must
*NL*
terminate
in
my
ruin
?
for
I
really
believe
,
some
time
or
other
,
I
shall
*NL*
cut
my
threat
,
to
put
a
period
both
to
my
life
,
and
to
the
terrors
of
my
*NL*
conscience
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
the
clergyman
shook
his
head
,
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
pray
tell
him
it
*NL*
is
not
too
late
;
Christ
will
give
him
repentance
,
if
he
has
recourse
to
*NL*
the
merit
of
his
passion
.
Does
he
think
he
is
beyond
the
power
of
Divine
*NL*
mercy
?
There
may
indeed
be
a
time
when
provoked
mercy
will
no
longer
*NL*
strive
,
but
never
too
late
for
men
to
repent
in
this
world
.
''
I
told
*NL*
Atkins
every
word
the
priest
had
said
,
who
then
parted
from
us
to
walk
*NL*
with
his
wife
,
while
we
discoursed
with
the
rest
.
But
these
were
very
*NL*
stupid
in
religious
matters
;
yet
all
of
them
promised
to
do
their
*NL*
endeavours
to
make
their
wives
turn
Christians
;
and
upon
which
promises
*NL*
the
priest
married
the
three
couple
.
But
as
Atkins
was
the
only
sincere
*NL*
convert
and
of
more
sense
than
the
rest
,
my
clergyman
was
earnestly
*NL*
inquiring
after
him
:
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
let
us
walk
out
of
this
labyrinth
,
*NL*
&
I
dare
say
we
shall
find
this
poor
man
preaching
to
his
wife
already
.
''
*NL*
And
indeed
we
found
it
true
;
for
coming
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
we
*NL*
perceived
Atkins
and
his
savage
wife
sitting
under
the
shade
of
a
bush
,
*NL*
in
very
earnest
discourse
;
he
pointed
to
the
sun
,
to
the
quarters
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
to
himself
,
to
her
,
the
woods
,
and
the
trees
.
Immediately
we
*NL*
could
perceive
him
start
upon
his
feet
,
fall
down
upon
his
knees
,
and
*NL*
lift
up
both
his
hands
;
at
which
the
tears
ran
down
my
clergyman
's
*NL*
cheeks
;
but
our
great
misfortune
was
,
we
could
not
hear
one
word
that
*NL*
passed
between
them
.
Another
time
he
would
embrace
her
,
wiping
the
tears
*NL*
from
her
eyes
,
kissing
her
with
the
greatest
transports
,
and
then
both
*NL*
kneel
down
for
some
minutes
together
.
Such
raptures
of
joy
did
this
*NL*
confirm
in
my
young
priest
,
that
he
could
scarcely
contain
himself
:
And
*NL*
a
little
after
this
,
we
observed
by
her
motion
,
as
frequently
lifting
up
*NL*
her
hands
,
and
laying
them
on
her
breast
,
that
she
was
mightily
affected
*NL*
with
his
discourse
,
and
so
they
withdrew
from
our
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
back
,
we
found
them
both
waiting
to
be
called
in
;
upon
*NL*
which
he
agreed
to
examine
him
alone
,
and
so
I
began
thus
to
discourse
*NL*
him
.
``
Prithee
,
Will
Atkins
,
''
said
I
,
``
what
education
have
you
?
What
was
*NL*
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
W.A.
_
A
better
man
than
ever
I
shall
be
;
he
was
,
Sir
,
a
clergyman
,
who
*NL*
gave
me
good
instruction
,
or
correction
,
which
I
despised
like
a
brute
*NL*
as
I
was
,
and
murdered
my
poor
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Pr
.
_
Ha
!
a
murderer
!
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
_
Here
the
priest
started
and
looked
pale
,
as
thinking
he
had
really
*NL*
killed
his
father
_
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
_
R.C.
_
What
,
did
you
kill
him
with
your
hands
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
W.A.
_
No
,
Sir
,
I
cut
not
his
throat
,
but
broke
his
heart
by
the
most
*NL*
unnatural
turn
of
disobedience
to
the
tenderest
and
best
of
fathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
R.C.
_
Well
,
I
pray
God
grant
you
repentance
:
I
did
not
ask
you
to
*NL*
exhort
a
confession
;
but
I
asked
you
because
I
see
you
have
more
*NL*
knowledge
of
what
is
good
than
your
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
W.A.
_
O
Sir
,
whenever
I
look
back
upon
my
past
life
,
conscience
*NL*
upbraids
me
with
my
father
:
the
sins
against
our
parents
make
the
*NL*
deepest
wounds
,
and
their
weight
lies
the
heaviest
upon
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
R.C.
_
You
talk
,
Will
,
too
feelingly
and
sensibly
for
me
;
I
am
not
able
*NL*
to
bear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
W.A.
_
You
bear
it
,
Sir

you
know
nothing
of
it

But
yes

Atkins

I
do
;
and
every
shore

valley

in
this

island

witness
the
anguish
of
my
soul
for
my
undutifulness
to
my
kind
*NL*
father
,
whom
I
have
murdered
likewise
;
yet
my
repentance
falls
*NL*
infinitely
short
of
yours
.
But

how
comes
the
sense
of
this
matter
*NL*
to
touch
you
just
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
W.A.
_
Sir
,
the
work
you
have
set
me
about
,
has
occasioned
it
;
for
*NL*
talking
to
my
wife
about
God
and
religion
,
she
has
preached
me
such
a
*NL*
sermon
,
that
I
shall
retain
it
in
lasting
remembrance

*NL*
_
R.C.

No

no

it
is
your
own
moving
pious
arguments

back

pray

what
*NL*
passed
between
you

your
wife
,
and
in
what
manner
you
did
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
W.A.
_
I
talked
to
her
of
the
laws
of
marriage
,
the
reason
of
such
*NL*
compacts
,
whereby
order
and
justice
is
maintained
;
without
which
men
*NL*
would
run
from
their

to
the
dissolution
of
families

inheritances

what
did

say
to
all
this
?

*NL*
_
Wife

_
What
,
not
know
great
God
in
own
nation
?
No
do
good
ting
?
No
say
*NL*
O
to
him
?
that
's
strange
!
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
But
,
my
dear
,
many
live
as
if
there
was
no
God
in
heaven
for
all
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Why
God
suffer
them
?
why
makee
not
live
well
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
It
is
our
own
faults
,
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
But
if
he
is
much
great
,
can
makee
kill
,
why
no
makee
kill
when
*NL*
no
serve
him
?
No
be
good
mans
,
no
cry
O
to
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
That
's
true
,
my
dear
,
he
may
strike
us
dead
,
but
his
abundant
mercy
*NL*
spareth
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Did
not
you
tell
God
thanked
for
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
No
,
I
have
neither
thanked
him
for
his
mercy
,
nor
feared
him
for
*NL*
his
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Then
me
not
believe
your
God
be
good
,
nor
makee
kill
,
when
you
*NL*
makee
him
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
Alas
!
must
my
wicked
life
hinder
you
from
believing
in
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
_
.
How
can
me
tink
your
God
lives
there
?
_
-LRB-
pointing
to
heaven
.
-RRB-
_
*NL*
Sure
he
no
ken
what
you
do
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
Yes
,
my
dear
,
he
hears
us
speak
,
sees
what
we
do
,
and
knows
what
we
*NL*
even
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Where
then
makee
power
strong
,
when
he
hears
you
curse
,
swear
de
*NL*
great
damn
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
My
dear
,
this
shows
indeed
he
is
a
God
and
not
a
man
who
has
such
*NL*
tender
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Mercy
I
what
you
call
mercy
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
He
pities
and
spares
us
:
as
he
is
our
great
Creator
,
so
he
is
also
*NL*
our
tender
Father
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
So
God
never
angry
,
never
kill
wicked
,
then
he
no
good
,
no
great
*NL*
mighty
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
O
my
dear
,
do
n't
say
so
,
he
is
both
;
and
many
times
he
shows
*NL*
terrible
examples
of
his
judgment
and
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Then
you
makee
de
bargain
with
him
;
you
do
bad
ting
,
he
no
hurt
*NL*
you
,
he
hurt
other
mans
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
No
,
indeed
,
my
lips
are
all
presumptions
upon
his
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Well
,
and
yet
no
makee
you
dead
;
and
you
give
him
no
tankee
*NL*
neither
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
It
is
true
,
I
an
ungrateful
,
unthankful
dog
,
that
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Why
,
you
say
,
he
makee
you
,
why
makee
you
no
much
better
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
It
is
I
alone
that
have
deformed
myself
,
and
abused
his
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
Pray
makee
God
know
me
,
me
no
makee
him
angry
,
no
do
bad
ting
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
You
mean
,
my
dear
,
that
you
desire
I
would
teach
you
to
know
God
:
*NL*
alas
!
poor
dear
creature
,
he
must
teach
thee
,
and
not
I
.
But
I
'll
pray
*NL*
earnestly
to
him
to
direct
thee
,
and
to
forgive
me
,
a
miserable
sinner
.
*NL*
_
-LRB-
Hereupon
he
went
a
little
distance
,
and
kneeling
down
,
prayed
*NL*
earnestly
to
God
to
enlighten
her
mind
,
and
to
pardon
his
sins
;
when
*NL*
this
was
done
,
they
continued
their
discourse
thus
.
-RRB-
_
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
What
you
put
down
knee
for
?
For
what
hold
up
hand
?
Who
you
speak
*NL*
to
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
My
dear
,
I
bowed
in
token
of
submission
to
him
that
made
me
,
and
*NL*
prayed
that
he
would
open
your
eyes
and
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
And
can
he
do
that
too
?
And
will
he
hear
what
you
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
Yes
,
my
dear
,
he
bids
us
pray
,
and
has
given
us
promise
that
he
*NL*
will
hear
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
.
_
When
did
he
bid
you
pray
?
What
I
do
you
hear
him
speak
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A.
_
No
,
my
dear
,
but
God
has
spoken
formerly
to
good
men
from
heaven
;
*NL*
and
by
divine
revelation
they
have
written
all
his
laws
down
in
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
_
.
O
where
dat
good
book
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A
_
.
I
have
it
not
now
by
me
;
but
one
time
or
other
I
shall
get
it
for
*NL*
you
to
read
.
_
Then
he
embraced
her
with
great
affection
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
_
.
Pray
tell
a
mee
,
did
God
,
teachee
them
write
that
book
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A
_
.
Yes
,
and
by
that
rule
we
know
him
to
be
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
_
.
What
way
,
what
rule
you
know
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
A
_
.
Because
he
teaches
what
is
good
,
just
,
and
holy
;
and
forbids
all
*NL*
wicked
and
abominable
actions
that
incur
his
displeasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Wife
_
.
O
me
fain
understand
that
,
and
if
he
do
all
things
you
say
he
*NL*
do
,
surely
he
hear
me
say
O
to
him
;
he
makee
me
good
if
I
wish
to
be
*NL*
good
,
he
no
kill
me
if
I
love
him
;
me
tink
,
believe
him
great
God
;
me
*NL*
say
O
to
him
,
along
with
you
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Here
the
poor
man
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
made
her
kneel
down
by
him
*NL*
praying
with
the
greatest
fervency
,
that
God
would
instruct
her
by
his
*NL*
Holy
Spirit
;
and
that
God
by
his
providence
would
send
them
a
Bible
for
*NL*
both
their
instructions
.
And
such
was
the
early
piety
of
this
new
*NL*
convert
,
that
she
made
him
promise
never
to
forsake
God
any
more
,
lest
*NL*
being
_
made
dead
,
_
as
she
called
it
;
she
should
not
only
want
her
*NL*
instructor
,
but
himself
be
miserable
in
a
long
eternity
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
surprising
account
as
this
was
,
proved
very
affecting
to
us
both
,
*NL*
but
particularly
to
the
young
clergyman
,
who
was
mightily
concerned
he
*NL*
could
not
talk
to
her
himself
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
,
is
something
more
*NL*
to
be
done
to
this
woman
then
to
marry
her
;
I
mean
that
she
ought
to
be
*NL*
baptized
.
''
To
this
,
I
presently
agreed
:
``
Pray
,
''
said
he
,
``
ask
her
*NL*
husband
,
whether
he
has
ever
talked
to
her
of
Jesus
Christ
,
the
*NL*
salvation
of
sinners
,
the
nature
of
faith
,
and
redemption
in
and
by
him
,
*NL*
of
the
Holy
Spirit
,
the
resurection
,
last
judgment
,
and
a
future
state
;
''
*NL*
but
the
poor
fellow
melted
into
tears
at
this
question
,
saying
,
that
he
*NL*
had
said
something
to
her
of
these
things
,
but
his
inability
to
talk
of
*NL*
them
,
made
him
afraid
,
lest
her
knowledge
of
them
should
rather
make
her
*NL*
contemn
religion
,
than
be
benefited
by
it
;
but
that
if
I
would
discourse
*NL*
with
her
,
it
would
be
very
evident
my
labour
would
not
be
in
vain
.
*NL*
Accordingly
I
called
her
in
,
and
placing
myself
as
interpreter
between
*NL*
the
religious
priest
and
the
woman
,
I
entreated
him
to
go
on
;
but
surely
*NL*
never
was
such
a
sermon
preached
by
any
clergyman
in
these
latter
days
,
*NL*
with
so
much
zeal
,
knowledge
,
and
sincerity
;
in
short
,
he
brought
the
*NL*
woman
to
embrace
the
knowledge
of
Christ
,
and
of
redemption
by
him
,
with
*NL*
so
surprising
a
degree
of
understanding
,
that
she
made
it
her
own
*NL*
request
to
be
baptized
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
than
performed
his
office
in
the
sacrament
of
baptism
,
first
,
by
*NL*
saying
some
words
over
to
himself
in
Latin
,
and
then
asking
me
to
give
*NL*
her
a
name
,
as
being
her
godfather
,
and
pouring
a
whole
dish-full
of
*NL*
water
upon
the
woman
's
head
,
he
said
,
''
_
Mary
_
,
I
baptize
thee
in
the
*NL*
name
of
the
Father
,
and
of
the
Son
,
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
''
so
that
none
*NL*
could
know
of
what
religion
he
was
.
After
this
he
pronounced
the
*NL*
benediction
in
Latin
.
Thus
the
woman
being
made
a
Christian
,
he
married
*NL*
her
to
Will
Atkins
;
which
being
finished
,
he
affectionately
exhorted
him
*NL*
to
lead
a
holy
life
for
the
future
;
and
since
the
Almighty
,
for
the
*NL*
convictions
of
his
conscience
,
had
honoured
him
to
be
the
instrument
or
*NL*
his
wife
's
conversion
,
he
should
not
dishonor
the
grace
of
God
,
that
*NL*
while
the
savage
was
converted
,
the
instrument
should
be
cast
away
.
Thus
*NL*
ended
a
ceremony
,
to
me
the
most
pleasant
and
agreeable
I
ever
passed
*NL*
in
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affairs
of
the
island
being
settled
,
I
was
preparing
to
go
on
board
,
*NL*
when
the
young
man
-LRB-
whose
mother
was
starved
-RRB-
came
to
me
,
saying
,
that
*NL*
as
he
understood
I
had
a
clergyman
with
me
,
who
had
married
the
*NL*
Englishmen
with
savages
,
he
had
a
match
to
make
between
two
Christians
,
*NL*
which
he
desired
might
be
finished
before
I
departed
.
Thinking
that
it
*NL*
was
he
himself
that
had
courted
his
mother
's
maid
,
I
persuaded
him
not
*NL*
to
do
any
thing
rashly
upon
the
account
of
his
solitary
circumstances
;
*NL*
that
the
maid
was
an
unequal
match
for
him
,
both
in
respect
to
substance
*NL*
and
years
;
and
that
it
was
very
probable
he
would
live
to
return
to
his
*NL*
own
country
,
where
he
might
have
a
far
better
choice
.
At
these
words
,
*NL*
smiling
,
he
interrupted
me
,
thanking
me
for
my
good-advice
;
that
as
he
*NL*
had
nothing
to
beg
of
me
but
a
small
settlement
,
with
a
servant
or
two
,
*NL*
or
some
new
necessaries
,
so
he
hoped
I
would
not
be
unmindful
of
him
*NL*
when
I
returned
to
England
,
but
give
his
letter
to
his
friends
;
and
that
*NL*
when
he
was
redeemed
,
the
plantation
,
and
all
its
improvements
,
however
*NL*
valuable
,
should
be
returned
to
me
again
.
But
as
for
the
marriage
he
*NL*
proposed
,
that
it
was
not
himself
,
but
that
it
was
between
my
*NL*
Jack-of-all-trades
and
the
maid
Susan
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
indeed
agreeably
surprised
at
the
mentioning
this
match
,
which
*NL*
seemed
very
suitable
,
the
one
being
a
very
ingenious
fellow
,
and
the
*NL*
other
an
excellent
,
dexterous
,
and
sensible
housewife
,
fit
to
be
*NL*
governess
of
the
whole
island
;
so
we
married
them
the
same
day
;
and
as
I
*NL*
was
her
father
,
and
gave
her
away
,
so
I
gave
her
a
handsome
portion
,
*NL*
appointing
her
and
her
husband
a
convenient
large
space
of
ground
for
*NL*
their
plantation
.
The
sharing
out
of
the
land
I
left
to
Will
Atkins
,
who
*NL*
really
divided
if
very
justly
,
to
every
person
's
satisfaction
;
they
only
*NL*
desired
one
general
writing
under
my
hand
for
the
whole
,
which
I
caused
*NL*
to
be
drawn
up
,
signed
,
and
sealed
to
them
,
setting
out
their
bounds
,
*NL*
and
giving
them
a
right
to
the
whole
possession
of
their
respective
*NL*
plantations
,
with
their
improvements
,
to
them
and
their
heirs
,
reserving
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
the
island
as
my
own
property
,
and
a
certain
rent
for
*NL*
every
particular
plantation
,
after
eleven
years
.
As
to
their
laws
and
*NL*
government
,
I
exhorted
them
to
love
one
another
;
and
as
to
the
Indians
*NL*
who
lived
in
a
nook
by
themselves
,
I
allotted
three
or
four
of
them
*NL*
plantations
,
and
the
rest
willingly
chose
to
become
servants
to
the
*NL*
other
families
,
by
which
means
they
were
employed
in
useful
labour
,
and
*NL*
fared
much
better
than
they
did
before
.
Besides
the
savages
thus
mixed
*NL*
with
the
Christians
,
the
work
of
their
conversion
might
be
set
on
foot
*NL*
by
the
latter
,
in
the
clergyman
's
absence
,
to
our
equal
satisfaction
.
*NL*
The
young
priest
,
however
,
was
a
little
anxious
lest
the
Christians
*NL*
should
not
be
willing
to
do
their
parts
in
instructing
these
poor
*NL*
Indians
;
I
therefore
told
him
we
should
call
them
all
together
;
that
he
*NL*
should
speak
to
the
Spaniards
who
were
Papists
,
and
I
to
the
English
,
*NL*
who
were
Protestants
,
and
make
them
promise
that
they
would
never
make
*NL*
any
distinction
in
religion
,
but
teach
the
general
true
knowledge
of
*NL*
God
,
and
his
son
Jesus
Christ
,
in
order
to
convert
the
poor
savages
.
And
*NL*
this
,
indeed
,
they
all
promised
us
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
Will
Atkins
's
house
,
I
found
his
baptized
wife
,
and
the
*NL*
young
woman
newly
married
to
my
Jack-of-all-trades
,
were
become
great
*NL*
intimates
,
and
discoursing
of
religion
together
.
_
O
,
Sir
,
_
says
Will
*NL*
Atkins
,
_
when
God
has
sinners
to
reconcile
to
himself
,
he
never
wants
an
*NL*
instructor
;
I
knew
I
was
unworthy
of
so
good
a
work
,
and
therefore
this
*NL*
young
woman
has
been
sent
hither
as
it
were
from
heaven
,
who
is
*NL*
sufficient
to
convert
a
whole
nation
of
savages
_
.
The
young
woman
*NL*
blushed
,
and
was
going
to
rise
;
but
I
desired
her
to
sit
still
,
and
*NL*
hoped
that
God
would
bless
her
in
so
good
a
work
;
and
then
pulling
out
a
*NL*
Bible
-LRB-
which
I
brought
on
purpose
in
my
pocket
for
him
.
-RRB-
_
Here
Atkins
_
,
*NL*
said
I
,
_
here
is
an
assistant
that
perhaps
you
had
not
before
_
.
So
*NL*
confounded
was
the
poor
man
,
that
is
was
some
time
before
he
could
*NL*
speak
;
at
last
turning
to
his
wife
,
_
My
dear
_
,
he
said
,
_
did
I
not
tell
*NL*
you
that
God
could
hear
what
we
said
?
Here
's
the
book
I
prayed
for
,
when
*NL*
you
and
I
kneeled
under
the
bush
:
God
then
heard
us
,
and
now
has
sent
*NL*
it
_
.
The
woman
was
surprised
,
and
thought
really
God
had
sent
that
*NL*
individual
book
from
heaven
;
but
I
turned
to
the
young
woman
,
and
*NL*
desired
her
to
explain
to
the
young
convert
,
that
God
may
properly
be
*NL*
said
to
answer
our
petitions
,
when
,
in
the
course
of
his
providence
,
*NL*
such
particular
things
came
to
pass
as
we
petitioned
for
.
This
the
young
*NL*
woman
did
effectually
;
but
surely
Will
Atkins
's
joy
can
not
be
expressed
;
*NL*
no
man
being
more
thankful
for
any
thing
in
the
world
,
than
he
was
for
*NL*
his
Bible
,
nor
desired
it
from
a
better
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
several
religious
discourses
,
I
desired
the
young
woman
to
give
me
*NL*
an
account
of
the
anguish
she
felt
when
she
was
starving
to
death
with
*NL*
hunger
;
to
which
she
readily
consented
,
and
began
in
the
*NL*
following
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
all
our
victuals
being
gone
,
after
I
had
fasted
one
*NL*
day
,
my
stomach
was
very
sickly
,
and
,
at
the
approach
,
of
night
,
I
was
*NL*
inclined
to
yawning
and
sleepy
.
When
I
slept
upon
the
couch
three
hours
,
*NL*
I
awaked
a
little
refreshed
:
three
hours
after
,
my
stomach
being
more
*NL*
and
more
sickly
,
I
lay
down
again
,
but
could
not
sleep
,
being
very
faint
*NL*
and
ill
.
Thus
I
passed
the
second
day
with
a
strange
variety
,
first
*NL*
hungry
,
then
sick
again
,
with
reachings
to
vomit
:
that
night
I
dreamed
I
*NL*
was
at
Barbadoes
,
buying
plenty
of
provisions
;
and
dined
heartily
.
But
*NL*
when
I
awaked
,
my
spirits
were
exceedingly
sunk
,
to
find
myself
in
the
*NL*
extremity
of
famine
.
There
was
but
one
glass
of
wine
,
which
being
mixed
*NL*
with
sugar
,
I
drank
up
;
but
for
want
of
substance
to
digest
upon
,
the
*NL*
fumes
of
it
got
into
my
head
,
&
made
me
senseless
for
some
time
.
The
*NL*
third
day
I
was
so
ravenous
and
furious
,
that
I
could
have
eaten
a
*NL*
little
child
if
it
had
come
in
my
way
;
during
which
time
,
I
was
as
mad
*NL*
as
any
creature
in
Bedlam
.
In
one
of
these
fits
I
fell
down
,
and
struck
*NL*
my
face
against
the
corner
of
a
pallet
bed
,
where
my
mistress
lay
;
the
*NL*
blood
gushed
out
of
my
nose
,
but
by
my
excessive
bleeding
,
both
the
*NL*
violence
of
the
fever
,
and
the
ravenous
part
of
the
hunger
abated
.
After
*NL*
this
,
I
grew
sick
again
,
strove
to
vomit
,
but
could
not
;
then
bleeding
a
*NL*
second
time
,
I
swooned
away
as
dead
;
when
I
came
to
myself
,
I
had
a
*NL*
dreadful
gnawing
pain
in
my
stomach
,
which
went
of
towards
night
,
with
a
*NL*
longing
desire
for
food
.
I
took
a
draught
of
water
and
sugar
,
but
it
*NL*
came
up
again
;
then
I
drank
water
without
sugar
,
and
that
staid
with
me
.
*NL*
I
laid
me
down
on
the
bed
,
praying
God
would
take
me
away
:
after
I
had
*NL*
slumbered
,
I
thought
myself
a-dying
,
therefore
recommended
my
soul
to
*NL*
God
,
and
wished
somebody
would
throw
me
into
the
sea
.
All
this
while
my
*NL*
departing
mistress
lay
by
me
:
the
last
bit
of
bread
she
had
,
she
gave
to
*NL*
her
dear
child
my
young
master
.
The
morning
after
,
I
fell
into
a
violent
*NL*
passion
of
crying
,
and
after
that
into
hunger
.
I
espied
the
blood
that
*NL*
came
from
my
nose
in
a
bison
,
which
I
immediately
swallowed
up
.
At
night
*NL*
I
had
the
usual
variations
,
as
the
pain
in
the
stomach
,
sick
,
sleepy
,
*NL*
and
ravenous
:
and
I
had
no
thought
but
that
I
should
die
before
morning
.
*NL*
In
the
morning
came
on
terrible
gripings
in
my
bowels
.
At
this
time
I
*NL*
heard
my
young
master
's
lamentations
,
by
which
I
understood
his
mother
*NL*
was
dead
.
Soon
after
this
,
the
sailors
cried
,
_
A
sail
!
A
sail
!
_
*NL*
hallooing
as
if
they
were
distracted
for
joy
of
that
relief
,
which
*NL*
afterwards
we
received
from
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
never
was
a
more
distinct
account
of
starving
to
death
than
this
.
*NL*
But
to
return
to
the
disposition
of
things
among
my
people
,
I
did
not
*NL*
take
any
notice
to
them
of
the
sloop
that
I
had
framed
,
neither
would
I
*NL*
leave
them
the
two
pieces
of
brass
cannon
,
or
the
two
quarter-deck
guns
*NL*
that
I
had
on
board
,
lest
,
upon
any
disgust
,
they
should
have
separated
,
*NL*
or
turned
pirates
,
and
so
made
the
island
a
den
of
thieves
,
instead
of
*NL*
a
plantation
of
sober
pious
people
:
but
leaving
them
in
a
flourishing
*NL*
condition
,
with
a
promise
to
send
them
further
relief
,
from
Brazil
,
as
*NL*
sheep
,
hogs
,
and
cows
-LRB-
being
obliged
to
kill
the
latter
at
sea
,
having
*NL*
no
hay
to
feed
them
-RRB-
I
went
on
board
the
ship
again
,
the
first
of
May
,
*NL*
1695
,
after
having
been
twenty
days
among
them
:
and
next
morning
,
giving
*NL*
them
a
salute
of
five
guns
at
parting
,
we
set
sail
for
the
Brazils
.
The
*NL*
third
day
,
towards
evening
,
there
happening
a
calm
,
and
the
current
*NL*
being
very
strong
,
we
were
drove
to
the
N.N.E.
towards
the
land
.
Some
*NL*
hours
after
,
we
perceived
the
sea
covered
as
it
were
with
something
very
*NL*
black
,
not
easily
at
first
to
be
discovered
:
upon
which
our
chief
mate
*NL*
ascending
the
shrouds
a
little
way
,
and
taking
a
view
with
a
perspective
*NL*
glass
,
he
cries
out
,
_
An
army
!
An
army
!
You
fool
_
,
said
I
,
_
what
do
you
*NL*
mean
?
Nay
,
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
do
n't
be
angry
.
I
assure
you
,
it
is
not
only
*NL*
an
army
,
but
a
fleet
,
too
,
for
I
believe
there
are
a
thousand
canoes
*NL*
paddling
along
,
and
making
with
great
haste
towards
us
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
every
one
of
us
were
surprised
at
this
relation
;
and
my
nephew
*NL*
the
captain
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
,
but
thought
we
should
*NL*
all
be
devoured
.
Nor
was
I
free
from
concern
,
when
I
considered
how
much
*NL*
we
were
becalmed
,
and
what
a
strong
current
set
towards
the
shore
;
*NL*
however
,
I
encouraged
him
not
to
be
afraid
,
but
bring
the
ship
to
an
*NL*
anchor
as
soon
as
we
were
certain
that
we
must
engage
them
.
Accordingly
*NL*
we
did
so
,
and
furled
all
our
sails
,
as
to
the
savages
we
feared
*NL*
nothing
,
but
only
that
they
might
se
the
ship
on
fire
;
to
prevent
which
,
*NL*
I
ordered
them
to
get
their
boats
out
,
and
fasten
them
,
one
close
by
the
*NL*
head
,
and
the
other
by
the
stern
,
well
manned
,
with
skeets
and
buckets
*NL*
to
extinguish
the
flames
,
should
it
so
happen
.
The
savages
soon
came
up
*NL*
with
us
,
but
there
were
not
so
many
as
the
mate
had
said
,
for
instead
of
*NL*
a
thousand
canoes
there
were
only
one
hundred
and
twenty
;
too
many
*NL*
indeed
for
us
,
several
of
their
canoes
containing
about
sixteen
or
*NL*
seventeen
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
approached
us
,
they
seemed
to
be
in
the
greatest
amazement
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
make
of
us
.
They
rowed
round
the
ship
,
which
occasioned
*NL*
us
to
call
to
the
men
in
the
boats
,
not
to
suffer
them
to
come
near
*NL*
them
.
Hereupon
they
beckoned
to
the
savages
to
keep
back
,
which
they
*NL*
accordingly
did
;
but
at
their
retreat
they
let
fly
about
fifty
arrows
*NL*
among
us
,
and
very
much
wounded
one
of
our
men
in
the
long-boat
.
I
*NL*
called
to
them
not
to
fire
upon
any
account
,
but
handing
them
down
some
*NL*
deal
boards
,
the
carpenters
made
them
a
kind
of
fence
to
shield
them
*NL*
from
the
arrows
.
In
half
an
hour
after
they
came
so
near
astern
of
us
,
*NL*
that
we
had
a
perfect
sight
of
them
;
then
they
rowed
a
little
farther
*NL*
out
,
till
they
came
directly
along-side
of
us
,
and
then
approached
so
*NL*
near
,
that
they
could
hear
us
speak
;
this
made
me
order
all
our
men
to
*NL*
keep
close
,
and
get
their
guns
ready
.
In
the
mean
time
I
ordered
Friday
*NL*
to
go
out
upon
deck
,
and
ask
them
in
his
language
what
they
meant
.
No
*NL*
sooner
did
he
do
so
,
but
six
of
the
savages
,
who
were
in
the
foremost
*NL*
canoes
,
stooping
down
,
showed
us
their
naked
backsides
,
as
much
as
to
*NL*
say
in
English
,
_
Kiss
our
_
--
:
but
Friday
quickly
knew
what
this
meant
,
*NL*
by
immediately
crying
out
they
were
going
to
shoot
;
unfortunately
for
*NL*
him
,
poor
creature
,
who
fell
under
the
cloud
of
three
hundred
arrows
,
no
*NL*
less
than
seven
piercing
through
his
body
,
killing
one
of
the
best
*NL*
servants
,
and
faithfullest
of
companions
in
all
my
solitudes
and
*NL*
afflictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
enraged
was
I
at
the
death
of
poor
Friday
,
that
the
guns
,
which
*NL*
before
were
charged
only
with
powder
,
to
frighten
them
,
I
ordered
to
be
*NL*
loaded
with
small
shot
;
nor
did
the
gunners
fail
in
their
aim
,
but
at
*NL*
this
broadside
split
and
overset
thirteen
or
fourteen
of
their
canoes
,
*NL*
which
killed
numbers
of
them
,
and
set
the
rest
a
swimming
,
the
others
,
*NL*
frightened
out
of
their
wits
,
little
regarding
their
fellows
drowning
,
*NL*
scoured
away
as
fast
as
they
could
.
One
poor
wretch
our
people
took
up
,
*NL*
swimming
for
his
life
,
an
hour
after
.
He
was
very
sullen
at
first
,
to
*NL*
that
he
would
neither
eat
nor
speak
;
but
I
took
a
way
to
cure
him
,
by
*NL*
ordering
them
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
,
which
they
did
,
and
then
he
*NL*
came
swimming
back
like
a
cork
,
calling
in
his
tongue
,
as
I
suppose
,
to
*NL*
save
him
.
So
we
took
him
on
board
,
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
*NL*
could
make
him
speak
or
understand
English
;
yet
when
we
had
taught
him
,
*NL*
he
told
us
,
`
they
were
going
with
their
kings
to
fight
a
great
battle
;
'
*NL*
and
when
we
asked
him
,
what
made
them
come
up
to
us
?
he
said
,
_
to
makee
*NL*
de
great
wonder
look
_
;
where
it
is
to
be
noted
,
that
those
natives
,
and
*NL*
those
of
Africa
,
always
add
to
_
e
_
's
at
the
end
of
English
words
,
as
*NL*
_
makee
,
takee
_
,
and
the
like
,
from
which
it
is
very
difficult
thing
to
*NL*
make
them
break
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
now
under
sail
,
we
took
our
last
farewell
of
poor
honest
Friday
,
*NL*
and
interred
him
with
all
possible
decency
and
solemnity
,
putting
him
in
*NL*
a
coffin
,
and
committing
him
to
the
deep
,
at
the
same
time
cauling
*NL*
eleven
guns
to
be
fired
at
him
.
Thus
ended
the
life
of
one
of
the
most
*NL*
grateful
,
faithful
,
honest
,
and
affectionate
servants
,
that
ever
any
man
*NL*
was
blessed
with
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
a
fair
wind
for
Brazil
,
in
about
twelve
days
time
we
made
*NL*
land
in
the
latitude
of
five
degrees
south
of
the
line
.
Four
days
we
*NL*
kept
on
S.
by
E.
in
sight
of
shore
,
when
we
made
Cape
St.
Augustin
,
and
*NL*
in
three
days
we
came
up
to
an
anchor
off
the
Bay
of
all
Saints
.
I
had
*NL*
great
difficulty
here
to
get
leave
to
hold
correspondence
on
shore
;
for
*NL*
neither
the
figure
of
my
partner
,
my
two
merchant
trustees
,
nor
the
fame
*NL*
of
my
wonderful
preservation
in
the
island
,
could
procure
me
the
favour
,
*NL*
till
such
time
as
the
prior
of
the
monastery
of
the
Augustines
-LRB-
to
*NL*
whom
I
had
given
500
moidores
-RRB-
obtained
leave
from
the
Governor
,
for
me
*NL*
personally
,
with
the
Captain
&
one
more
,
together
with
eight
sailors
,
to
*NL*
come
on
shore
;
upon
this
condition
,
that
we
should
not
land
any
goods
*NL*
out
of
the
ship
,
nor
carry
any
person
away
without
licence
;
I
found
*NL*
means
,
however
,
to
get
on
shore
three
bales
of
English
goods
,
such
as
*NL*
fine
broad
cloths
,
stuffs
,
and
some
linen
,
which
I
brought
as
a
present
*NL*
for
my
partner
,
who
had
sent
me
on
board
a
present
of
fresh
provisions
,
*NL*
wine
and
sweetmeats
,
worth
about
thirty
moidores
,
including
some
*NL*
tobacco
,
and
three
or
four
fine
gold
medals
.

*NL*
obliged
him
to
fit
up
the
sloop
I
bought
for
the
use
of
my
island
,
in
*NL*
order
to
send
them
refreshments
;
and
so
active
was
he
in
this
matter
,
*NL*
that
he
had
the
vessel
finished
in
a
few
days
,
to
the
master
of
which
I
*NL*
gave
particular
instructions
to
find
the
place
.
I
soon
loaded
him
with
a
*NL*
small
cargo
;
and
one
of
our
sailors
offered
to
settle
there
,
upon
my
*NL*
letter
to
the
Spanish
governor
,
if
I
would
allot
him
tools
and
a
*NL*
plantation
.
This
I
willingly
granted
,
and
gave
him
the
savage
we
had
*NL*
taken
prisoner
to
be
his
slave
.
All
things
being
ready
for
the
voyage
,
*NL*
my
old
partner
told
me
there
was
an
acquaintance
of
his
,
a
Brazil
*NL*
planter
,
who
having
fallen
under
the
displeasure
of
the
church
,
&
in
*NL*
fear
of
the
Inquisition
which
obliged
him
to
be
concealed
,
would
be
glad
*NL*
of
such
an
opportunity
to
make
his
escape
,
with
his
wife
&
two
*NL*
daughters
;
&
if
I
would
allot
them
a
plantation
in
my
island
,
he
would
*NL*
give
them
a
small
stock
to
begin
with
,
for
that
the
officers
had
already
*NL*
seized
his
effects
and
estate
,
and
left
him
nothing
but
a
little
*NL*
household
stuff
and
two
slaves
.
This
request
I
presently
granted
,
*NL*
concealing
him
and
his
family
on
board
our
ship
,
till
such
time
as
the
*NL*
sloop
-LRB-
where
all
the
effects
were
-RRB-
was
gone
out
of
the
bay
,
and
then
we
*NL*
put
them
on
board
,
who
carried
some
materials
,
and
plants
for
planting
*NL*
sugar-canes
,
along
with
them
.
By
this
sloop
,
among
other
things
,
I
sent
*NL*
my
subjects
three
milch
cows
and
five
calves
,
about
22
hogs
,
three
sows
*NL*
big
with
pig
,
two
mares
and
a
stone
horse
.
I
also
engaged
three
Portugal
*NL*
women
to
go
for
sake
of
the
Spaniards
,
which
,
with
the
persecuted
man
's
*NL*
two
daughters
,
were
sufficient
,
since
the
rest
had
wives
of
their
own
,
*NL*
though
in
another
country
;
all
which
cargo
arrived
safe
,
no
doubt
to
*NL*
their
exceeding
comfort
,
who
,
with
this
addition
,
were
about
sixty
or
*NL*
seventy
people
,
besides
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
place
,
my
truly
honest
and
pious
clergyman
left
me
;
for
a
ship
*NL*
being
ready
to
set
sail
for
Lisbon
,
he
asked
me
leave
to
go
thither
,
but
*NL*
I
assure
you
it
was
with
the
greatest
reluctance
I
parted
from
a
person
,
*NL*
whose
virtue
and
piety
merited
the
greatest
esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
Brazils
,
we
made
directly
over
the
Atlantic
Ocean
to
the
Cape
*NL*
of
Good
Hope
,
having
a
tolerable
good
voyage
,
steering
for
the
most
part
*NL*
S.E.
.
We
were
on
a
trading
voyage
,
and
had
a
supercargo
on
board
,
who
*NL*
was
to
direct
all
the
ship
's
motions
after
she
arrived
at
the
Cape
,
only
*NL*
being
limited
to
a
certain
number
of
days
,
for
stay
,
by
charter
party
,
*NL*
at
the
several
ports
she
was
to
go
to
.
At
the
Cape
we
only
took
in
fresh
*NL*
water
,
and
then
sailed
for
the
coast
of
Coromandel
;
we
were
there
*NL*
informed
,
that
a
French
man
of
war
of
50
guns
,
and
two
large
merchant
*NL*
ships
were
sailed
for
the
Indies
,
but
we
heard
no
more
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
passage
,
we
touched
at
the
island
of
Madagascar
,
where
,
though
*NL*
the
inhabitants
are
naturally
fierce
and
treacherous
,
&
go
constantly
*NL*
armed
with
bows
&
lances
,
yet
for
some
time
they
treated
us
civily
*NL*
enough
;
and
,
in
exchange
for
knives
,
scisors
,
and
other
trifles
,
they
*NL*
brought
us
eleven
good
fat
bullocks
,
which
we
took
partly
for
present
*NL*
victuals
,
and
the
remainder
to
salt
for
the
ship
's
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
curious
was
I
to
view
every
corner
of
the
world
where
I
came
to
,
that
*NL*
I
went
on
shore
as
often
as
I
could
.
One
evening
when
on
shore
,
we
*NL*
observed
numbers
of
the
people
stand
gazing
at
us
at
a
distance
.
We
*NL*
thought
ourselves
in
no
danger
,
as
they
had
hitherto
used
us
kindly
.
*NL*
However
,
we
cut
three
boughs
cut
of
a
tree
,
sticking
them
at
a
distance
*NL*
from
us
,
which
it
seems
,
in
that
country
,
is
not
only
a
token
of
truce
*NL*
and
amity
,
but
when
poles
or
boughs
are
set
up
on
the
other
side
,
it
is
*NL*
a
sign
the
truce
is
accepted
.
In
these
treaties
,
however
,
there
is
one
*NL*
principal
thing
to
be
regarded
,
that
neither
party
come
beyond
one
*NL*
another
's
three
poles
or
boughs
;
so
that
the
middle
space
is
not
only
*NL*
secure
,
but
is
also
allowed
as
a
market
for
traffic
and
commerce
.
When
*NL*
the
truce
is
thus
accepted
,
they
stick
up
their
javelins
and
lances
at
*NL*
the
first
poles
,
and
come
on
unarmed
;
but
if
any
violence
is
offered
,
*NL*
away
they
run
to
their
poles
,
take
up
their
weapons
,
and
then
the
truce
*NL*
is
at
an
end
.
This
evening
it
happened
that
a
greater
number
of
people
*NL*
than
usual
,
both
men
and
women
,
traded
among
us
for
such
toys
as
we
had
,
*NL*
with
such
great
civility
,
that
we
made
us
a
little
tent
,
of
large
boughs
*NL*
of
trees
,
some
of
the
men
resolving
to
lie
on
shore
all
night
;
but
,
for
*NL*
my
part
,
I
and
some
others
took
our
lodging
in
the
boat
,
with
boughs
of
*NL*
trees
spread
over
it
,
having
a
sail
spread
at
the
bottom
to
lie
upon
.
*NL*
About
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
we
were
awakened
by
the
firing
of
*NL*
muskets
,
and
our
men
crying
out
for
help
,
or
else
they
would
all
be
*NL*
murdered
.
Scarce
had
we
time
to
get
the
boat
ashore
,
when
our
men
came
*NL*
plunging
themselves
into
the
water
,
with
about
four
hundred
of
the
*NL*
islanders
at
their
heels
.
We
took
up
seven
of
the
men
,
three
of
them
*NL*
very
much
wounded
,
and
one
left
behind
killed
,
while
the
enemy
poured
*NL*
their
arrows
so
thick
among
us
,
that
we
were
forced
to
make
a
barricade
,
*NL*
with
boards
lying
at
the
side
of
the
boat
,
to
shield
us
from
danger
:
*NL*
and
,
having
got
ready
our
fire-arms
,
we
returned
them
a
volley
,
which
*NL*
wounded
several
of
them
,
as
we
could
hear
by
their
cries
.
In
this
*NL*
condition
we
lay
till
break
of
day
,
and
then
making
signals
of
distress
*NL*
to
the
ship
,
which
my
nephew
the
captain
heard
and
understood
,
he
*NL*
weighed
anchor
,
&
stood
as
near
the
shore
as
possible
,
and
then
sent
*NL*
another
boat
with
ten
hands
in
her
to
assist
us
;
but
we
called
to
them
*NL*
not
to
come
near
,
informing
them
of
our
unhappy
condition
.
However
they
*NL*
ventured
;
when
one
of
the
men
taking
the
end
of
a
tow-line
in
one
hand
,
*NL*
and
keeping
our
boat
between
him
and
our
adversaries
,
swam
to
us
,
and
*NL*
slipping
our
cables
,
they
towed
us
,
out
of
reach
of
their
arrows
,
and
*NL*
quickly
after
a
broadside
was
given
them
from
the
ship
,
which
made
a
*NL*
most
dreadful
havoc
among
them
.
When
we
got
on
board
,
we
examined
into
*NL*
the
occasion
of
this
fray
.
The
men
who
fled
informed
us
that
an
old
*NL*
woman
who
sold
milk
within
the
poles
,
had
brought
a
young
woman
with
*NL*
her
,
who
carried
roots
or
herbs
,
the
sight
of
whom
so
much
tempted
our
*NL*
men
,
that
they
offered
rudeness
to
the
maid
,
at
which
the
old
woman
set
*NL*
up
a
great
cry
:
nor
would
the
sailors
part
with
the
prize
,
but
carried
*NL*
her
among
the
trees
,
while
the
old
woman
went
,
and
brought
a
whole
army
*NL*
down
upon
them
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
attack
,
one
of
our
men
was
*NL*
killed
with
a
lance
,
and
the
fellow
who
began
the
mischief
,
paid
dear
*NL*
enough
for
his
mistress
,
though
as
yet
we
did
not
know
what
had
become
*NL*
of
him
;
the
rest
luckily
escaped
.
The
third
night
after
the
action
,
*NL*
being
curious
to
understand
how
affairs
stood
,
I
took
the
supercargo
and
*NL*
twenty
stout
fellows
with
me
,
and
landed
about
two
hours
before
*NL*
midnight
,
at
the
same
place
where
those
Indians
stood
the
night
before
,
*NL*
and
there
we
divided
our
men
into
two
bodies
,
the
boatswain
commanding
*NL*
one
,
and
I
another
.
It
was
so
dark
,
that
we
could
see
nobody
,
neither
*NL*
did
we
hear
any
voice
near
us
:
but
by
&
bye
the
boatswain
falling
over
a
*NL*
dead
body
,
we
agreed
to
halt
till
the
moon
should
rise
,
which
he
knew
*NL*
would
be
in
an
hour
after
.
We
perceived
here
no
fewer
than
two
and
*NL*
thirty
bodies
upon
the
ground
,
whereof
two
were
not
quite
dead
.
*NL*
Satisfied
with
this
discovery
I
was
for
going
on
board
again
;
but
the
*NL*
boatswain
and
the
rest
told
me
,
they
would
make
a
visit
to
the
Indian
*NL*
town
,
where
these
dogs
-LRB-
so
they
called
them
-RRB-
resided
,
asking
me
at
the
*NL*
same
time
to
go
along
with
them
;
for
they
did
not
doubt
,
besides
getting
*NL*
a
good
booty
,
but
they
should
find
Tom
Jeffery
there
,
for
that
was
the
*NL*
unhappy
man
we
missed
.
But
I
utterly
refused
to
go
,
and
commanded
them
*NL*
back
,
being
unwilling
to
hazard
their
lives
,
as
the
safety
of
the
ship
*NL*
wholly
depended
upon
them
.
Notwithstanding
all
I
could
say
to
them
,
they
*NL*
all
left
me
but
one
,
and
the
supercargo
;
so
we
three
returned
to
the
*NL*
boat
,
where
a
boy
was
left
,
resolving
to
stay
till
they
returned
.
At
*NL*
parting
I
told
them
I
supposed
most
of
them
would
run
the
same
fate
with
*NL*
Tom
Jeffery
.
To
this
they
replied
,
_
Come
boys
,
come
along
,
we
'll
warrant
*NL*
we
'll
come
off
safe
enough
_
;
and
so
away
they
went
,
notwithstanding
all
*NL*
my
admonitions
,
either
concerning
their
own
safety
or
the
preservation
*NL*
of
the
ship
.
Indeed
they
were
gallantly
armed
,
every
man
having
a
*NL*
musket
,
bayonet
,
and
a
pistol
,
besides
cutlasses
,
hangers
,
pole-axes
,
*NL*
and
hand
granades
.
They
came
to
a
few
Indian
houses
at
first
,
which
not
*NL*
being
the
town
they
expected
they
went
farther
,
&
finding
a
cow
tied
to
*NL*
a
tree
,
they
concluded
that
she
would
be
a
sufficient
guide
,
and
so
it
*NL*
proved
;
for
,
after
they
untied
her
,
she
led
them
directly
to
the
town
,
*NL*
which
consisted
of
above
two
hundred
houses
,
several
families
living
in
*NL*
some
of
the
huts
together
.
At
their
arrival
,
all
being
in
a
profound
*NL*
sleep
,
the
sailors
agreed
to
divide
themselves
into
three
bodies
,
and
*NL*
set
three
parts
of
the
town
on
fire
at
once
,
to
kill
those
that
were
*NL*
escaping
,
and
plunder
the
rest
of
the
houses
.
Thus
desperately
resolved
,
*NL*
they
went
to
work
;
but
the
first
party
had
not
gone
far
,
before
they
*NL*
called
out
to
the
rest
,
that
they
had
found
Tom
Jeffery
;
whereupon
they
*NL*
all
ran
up
to
the
place
,
and
found
the
poor
fellow
indeed
hanging
up
*NL*
naked
by
one
arm
,
and
his
throat
almost
cut
from
ear
to
ear
.
In
a
house
*NL*
that
was
hard
by
the
tree
,
they
found
sixteen
or
seventeen
Indians
,
who
*NL*
had
been
concerned
in
the
fray
,
two
or
three
of
them
being
wounded
,
were
*NL*
not
gone
to
sleep
:
this
house
they
set
on
fire
first
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
after
,
five
or
six
places
more
in
the
town
appeared
in
flames
.
*NL*
The
conflagration
spread
like
wild-fire
,
their
housing
being
all
of
*NL*
wood
,
and
covered
with
flags
or
rushes
.
The
poor
affrighted
inhabitants
*NL*
endeavoured
to
run
out
to
save
their
lives
,
but
they
were
driven
back
*NL*
into
the
flames
by
the
sailors
,
and
killed
without
mercy
.
At
the
first
*NL*
house
above
mentioned
,
after
the
boatswain
had
slain
two
with
his
*NL*
pole-ax
,
he
threw
a
hand-granade
into
the
house
,
which
bursting
,
made
a
*NL*
terrible
havoc
,
killing
and
wounding
most
of
them
;
and
their
king
and
*NL*
most
of
his
train
,
who
were
then
in
that
house
,
fell
victims
to
their
*NL*
fury
,
every
creature
of
them
being
either
smothered
or
burnt
.
All
this
*NL*
while
they
never
fired
a
gun
,
lest
the
people
should
awaken
faster
than
*NL*
they
could
overpower
them
.
But
the
fire
awakened
them
fast
enough
,
which
*NL*
obliged
our
fellows
to
keep
together
in
bodies
.
By
this
time
the
whole
*NL*
town
was
in
a
flame
,
yet
their
fury
rather
increased
,
calling
out
to
one
*NL*
another
to
remember
Tom
Jeffery
.
The
terrible
light
of
this
*NL*
conflagration
made
me
very
uneasy
,
and
roused
my
nephew
the
captain
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
men
,
who
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
.
When
he
perceived
*NL*
the
dreadful
smoke
,
and
heard
the
guns
go
off
,
he
readily
concluded
his
*NL*
men
were
in
danger
;
he
therefore
takes
another
boat
,
and
comes
ashore
*NL*
himself
,
with
thirteen
men
well
armed
.
He
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
*NL*
me
and
only
two
men
in
the
boat
,
but
more
so
when
I
told
him
the
story
:
*NL*
but
though
I
argued
with
him
,
as
I
did
with
the
men
,
about
the
danger
*NL*
of
the
voyage
,
the
interests
of
the
merchants
and
owners
,
and
the
*NL*
safety
of
the
ship
,
yet
my
nephew
,
like
the
rest
,
declared
,
that
he
*NL*
would
rather
lose
the
ship
,
his
voyage
,
his
life
and
all
,
than
his
men
*NL*
should
be
lost
for
want
of
help
;
and
so
away
he
went
.
For
my
part
,
*NL*
seeing
him
resolved
to
go
,
I
had
not
power
to
stay
behind
.
He
ordered
*NL*
the
pinnace
back
again
for
twelve
men
more
,
and
then
we
marched
directly
*NL*
as
the
flame
guided
us
.
But
surely
never
was
such
a
scene
of
horror
*NL*
beheld
,
or
more
dismal
cries
heard
,
except
when
Oliver
Cromwell
took
*NL*
Drogheda
in
Ireland
,
where
he
neither
spared
man
,
woman
,
nor
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
object
,
I
think
,
we
met
with
,
was
the
ruins
of
one
of
their
*NL*
habitations
,
before
which
lay
four
men
and
three
woman
killed
,
and
two
*NL*
more
burnt
to
death
among
the
fire
,
which
was
now
decaying
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
appear
more
barbarous
than
this
revenge
;
none
more
cruel
than
the
*NL*
authors
of
it
.
As
we
went
on
,
the
fire
increased
,
and
the
cry
proceeded
*NL*
in
proportion
.
We
had
not
gone
much
farther
,
when
we
beheld
three
naked
*NL*
women
,
followed
by
sixteen
or
seventeen
men
,
flying
with
the
greatest
*NL*
swiftness
from
our
men
,
who
shot
one
of
them
in
our
sight
.
When
they
*NL*
perceived
us
,
whom
they
supposed
also
their
murderers
,
they
set
up
a
*NL*
most
dreadful
shriek
,
and
both
of
them
swooned
away
in
the
fright
.
This
*NL*
was
a
sight
which
might
have
softened
the
hardest
heart
;
and
in
pity
we
*NL*
took
some
ways
to
let
them
know
we
would
not
hurt
them
,
while
the
poor
*NL*
creatures
with
bended
knees
,
and
lifted
up
hands
,
made
piteous
*NL*
lamentations
to
us
to
save
their
lives
.
I
ordered
our
men
not
to
hunt
*NL*
any
of
the
poor
creatures
whatsoever
;
but
being
willing
to
understand
*NL*
the
occasion
of
all
this
,
I
went
among
these
unhappy
wretches
,
who
*NL*
neither
understood
me
,
nor
the
good
I
meant
them
.
However
being
resolved
*NL*
to
put
an
end
to
this
barbarity
,
I
ordered
the
men
to
follow
me
.
We
had
*NL*
not
gone
fifty
yards
before
we
came
up
with
the
boatswain
,
with
four
of
*NL*
our
men
at
his
heels
,
all
of
them
covered
with
blood
and
dust
,
and
in
*NL*
search
of
more
people
to
satiate
their
vengeance
.
As
soon
as
we
saw
*NL*
them
,
we
called
out
,
and
made
them
understand
who
we
were
;
upon
which
*NL*
they
came
up
to
us
,
setting
up
a
holloo
of
triumph
,
in
token
that
more
*NL*
help
was
come
.
_
Noble
Captain
_
,
said
he
to
my
nephew
,
_
I
'm
glad
your
*NL*
come
:
we
have
not
half
done
with
these
villainous
hell-hound
dogs
;
*NL*
wee
'll
root
out
the
very
nation
of
them
from
the
earth
,
and
kill
more
*NL*
than
poor
Tom
has
hairs
upon
his
head
:
_
and
thus
he
went
on
till
I
*NL*
interrupted
him
.
--
``
Blood-thirsty
dog
,
''
said
I
,
``
will
your
cruelty
never
*NL*
end
?
I
charge
you
touch
not
one
creature
more
;
stop
your
hands
and
stand
*NL*
still
,
or
you
're
a
dead
man
this
moment
.
''
_
Why
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
you
*NL*
neither
know
whom
you
are
protecting
,
nor
what
they
have
done
:
but
pray
*NL*
come
hither
,
and
behold
an
instance
of
compassion
,
if
such
can
merit
*NL*
your
clemency
_
;
and
with
that
he
shewed
me
the
poor
fellow
with
his
*NL*
throat
cut
,
hanging
upon
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
here
was
enough
to
fill
their
breasts
with
rage
,
which
,
however
,
*NL*
I
thought
had
gone
too
far
,
agreeable
to
these
words
of
Jacob
to
his
*NL*
sons
Simeon
and
Levi
:
_
Cursed
be
their
anger
for
it
was
fierce
;
and
*NL*
their
wrath
;
for
it
was
cruel
.
_
But
this
sight
made
my
nephew
and
the
*NL*
rest
as
bad
as
they
:
nay
,
my
nephew
declared
,
his
concern
was
only
for
*NL*
his
men
;
as
for
the
people
,
not
a
soul
of
them
ought
to
live
.
Upon
this
,
*NL*
the
boatswain
and
eight
more
directly
turned
about
,
and
went
to
finish
*NL*
the
intended
tragedy
;
which
being
out
of
my
power
to
prevent
,
I
returned
*NL*
back
from
the
dismal
sight
,
&
the
piteous
cries
of
those
unfortunate
*NL*
creatures
,
who
were
made
victims
to
their
fury
.
Indeed
,
it
was
an
*NL*
egregious
piece
of
folly
in
me
to
return
to
the
boat
with
but
one
*NL*
attendant
;
and
I
had
very
near
paid
for
it
,
having
narrowly
escaped
*NL*
forty
armed
Indians
,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
conflagration
;
but
*NL*
having
passed
the
place
where
they
stood
,
I
got
to
the
boat
accompanied
*NL*
with
the
supercargo
,
and
so
went
on
board
,
sending
the
pinnace
back
*NL*
again
,
to
assist
the
men
in
what
might
happen
.
When
I
had
got
to
the
*NL*
boat
,
the
fire
was
almost
extinguished
,
and
the
noise
abated
;
but
I
had
*NL*
scarce
been
half
an
hour
on
board
the
ship
,
when
I
heard
another
volley
*NL*
given
by
our
sailors
,
and
a
great
smoke
,
which
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
*NL*
was
our
men
falling
upon
those
houses
and
persons
that
stood
between
*NL*
them
and
the
sea
;
but
here
they
spared
the
wives
and
children
,
and
*NL*
killed
only
the
men
,
to
the
number
of
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
.
By
the
*NL*
time
they
got
to
the
shore
,
the
pinnace
and
the
ship
's
boat
were
ready
*NL*
to
receive
them
,
and
they
all
got
safe
on
board
,
not
a
man
of
them
*NL*
having
received
the
least
hurt
,
except
two
,
one
of
whom
strained
his
*NL*
foot
,
and
the
other
burnt
his
hand
a
little
;
for
they
met
with
no
*NL*
resistance
,
the
poor
Indians
being
unprepared
,
amazed
,
and
confounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
extremely
angry
with
every
one
of
them
,
but
particularly
with
the
*NL*
captain
,
who
instead
of
cooling
the
rage
of
the
men
,
had
prompted
them
*NL*
on
to
further
mischief
:
nor
could
he
make
me
any
other
excuse
,
but
that
*NL*
as
he
was
a
man
,
he
could
not
master
his
passions
at
the
sight
of
one
of
*NL*
his
men
so
cruelly
murdered
.
As
for
the
rest
,
knowing
they
were
not
*NL*
under
my
command
,
they
took
no
notice
of
any
anger
,
but
rather
boasted
*NL*
of
their
revenge
.
According
to
all
their
accounts
,
they
killed
or
*NL*
destroyed
about
150
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
besides
burning
the
town
*NL*
to
ashes
.
They
took
their
companion
Tom
Jeffery
from
the
tree
,
covered
*NL*
him
with
some
of
the
ruins
,
and
so
left
him
.
But
however
this
action
of
*NL*
our
men
might
seem
to
them
justifiable
,
yet
I
always
openly
condemned
it
*NL*
with
the
appellation
,
of
the
Massacre
of
Madagascar
.
For
tho
'
the
*NL*
natives
had
slain
this
Jeffery
,
yet
certainly
he
was
the
first
*NL*
aggressor
,
by
attempting
to
violate
the
chastity
of
a
young
innocent
*NL*
woman
,
who
ventured
down
to
them
,
on
the
faith
of
the
public
*NL*
capitulation
,
which
was
so
treacherously
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
under
sail
,
the
boatswain
would
often
defend
this
bloody
*NL*
action
,
by
saying
,
that
the
Indians
had
broke
the
truce
the
night
*NL*
before
,
by
shooting
one
of
our
men
without
just
provocation
:
and
what
if
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
had
taken
a
little
liberty
with
the
wench
,
he
ought
not
*NL*
to
have
been
murdered
in
so
villainous
a
manner
:
and
that
they
had
acted
*NL*
nothing
but
what
the
divine
laws
commissioned
to
be
done
to
such
*NL*
homicides
.
However
I
was
in
the
same
mind
as
before
,
telling
them
that
*NL*
they
were
murderers
,
and
bid
them
depend
upon
it
that
God
would
blast
*NL*
their
voyage
,
for
such
an
unparalleled
piece
of
barbarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
Gulph
of
Persia
,
five
of
our
men
,
who
ventured
on
*NL*
shore
,
were
either
killed
or
made
slaves
by
the
Arabians
,
the
rest
of
*NL*
them
having
scarce
time
to
escape
to
their
boat
.
This
made
me
upbraid
*NL*
them
afresh
with
the
just
retribution
of
Heaven
for
such
actions
;
upon
*NL*
which
the
boatswain
very
warmly
asked
me
,
_
Whether
those
men
on
whom
the
*NL*
tower
of
Siloam
fell
,
were
greater
sinners
than
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
Galileans
?
and
besides
,
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
none
of
these
five
poor
men
that
*NL*
are
lost
,
were
with
us
at
the
Massacre
of
Madagascar
,
as
you
call
it
,
*NL*
and
therefore
your
representation
is
very
unjust
,
and
your
application
*NL*
improper
.
Besides
_
,
added
he
,
_
you
are
continually
using
the
men
very
*NL*
ill
upon
this
account
,
and
,
being
but
a
passenger
yourself
,
we
are
not
*NL*
obliged
to
bear
it
;
nor
can
we
tell
what
evil
designs
you
may
have
to
*NL*
bring
us
to
judgment
for
it
in
England
:
and
,
therefore
,
if
you
do
not
*NL*
leave
this
discourse
,
as
also
not
concern
yourself
with
any
of
our
*NL*
affairs
,
I
will
leave
the
ship
,
and
not
sail
among
such
*NL*
dangerous
company
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
I
heard
very
patiently
;
but
,
it
being
often
repeated
,
I
at
*NL*
length
told
him
,
the
concern
I
had
on
board
was
none
of
his
business
;
*NL*
that
I
was
a
considerable
owner
in
the
ship
,
and
therefore
had
a
right
*NL*
to
speak
in
common
,
and
that
I
was
no
way
accountable
to
him
,
nor
to
any
*NL*
body
else
.
As
no
more
passed
for
some
time
after
,
I
thought
all
had
been
*NL*
over
.
At
this
time
we
were
in
the
road
of
Bengal
,
where
,
going
on
shore
*NL*
with
the
supercargo
one
day
,
in
the
evening
,
as
I
was
preparing
to
go
on
*NL*
board
,
one
of
the
men
came
to
me
,
and
told
me
,
I
need
not
trouble
myself
*NL*
to
come
to
the
boat
,
for
that
the
cockswain
and
others
had
ordered
him
*NL*
not
to
carry
me
on
board
any
more
.
This
insulent
message
much
surprised
*NL*
me
;
yet
I
gave
him
no
answer
to
it
,
but
went
directly
and
acquainted
the
*NL*
supercargo
,
entreating
him
to
go
on
board
,
and
,
by
acquainting
the
*NL*
Captain
with
it
,
prevent
the
mutiny
which
I
perceived
would
happen
.
But
*NL*
before
I
had
spoken
this
,
the
matter
was
effected
on
board
;
for
no
*NL*
sooner
was
he
gone
off
in
the
boat
,
but
the
boatswain
,
gunner
,
*NL*
carpenter
,
and
all
the
inferior
officers
,
came
to
the
quarter-deck
,
*NL*
desiring
to
speak
with
the
Captain
;
&
there
the
boatswain
made
a
long
*NL*
harangue
,
exclaiming
against
me
,
as
before
mentioned
,
that
,
if
I
had
not
*NL*
gone
on
shore
peaceably
,
for
my
own
diversion
,
they
,
by
violence
would
*NL*
have
compelled
me
,
for
their
satisfaction
:
that
as
they
had
shipped
with
*NL*
the
Captain
,
so
they
would
faithfully
serve
him
;
but
if
I
did
not
quit
*NL*
the
ship
,
or
the
Captain
oblige
me
to
it
,
they
would
leave
the
ship
*NL*
immediately
:
hereupon
,
turning
his
face
about
by
way
of
signal
,
they
all
*NL*
cried
out
,
``
ONE
and
ALL
!
ONE
and
ALL
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
be
sure
,
that
though
my
nephew
was
a
man
of
great
courage
,
yet
*NL*
he
could
not
but
be
surprised
at
their
sudden
and
unexpected
behaviour
;
*NL*
and
though
he
talked
stoutly
to
them
,
and
afterwards
expostulated
with
*NL*
them
,
that
in
common
justice
to
me
,
who
was
a
considerable
owner
in
the
*NL*
ship
,
they
could
not
turn
me
as
it
were
out
of
mine
own
house
,
which
*NL*
might
bring
their
lives
in
danger
should
they
ever
be
taken
in
England
;
*NL*
nay
,
though
he
invited
the
boatswain
on
shore
to
accomodate
matters
with
*NL*
me
,
yet
all
this
I
say
,
signified
nothing
;
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
me
;
and
they
were
resolved
to
go
on
shore
if
I
came
on
board
.
*NL*
_
Well
,
_
said
my
nephew
,
_
if
you
are
so
resolved
,
permit
me
to
talk
with
*NL*
him
,
and
then
I
have
done
;
and
so
he
came
to
me
,
giving
me
an
account
of
*NL*
their
resolution
,
how
one
and
all
designed
to
forsake
the
ship
when
I
*NL*
came
on
board
,
for
which
he
was
mightily
concerned
.
_
``
I
am
glad
to
see
*NL*
you
,
nephew
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
rejoice
it
is
no
worse
,
since
they
have
not
*NL*
rebelled
against
you
;
I
only
desire
you
to
send
my
necessary
things
on
*NL*
shore
,
with
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
,
and
I
will
find
my
way
to
England
*NL*
as
well
as
I
can
.
''
Though
this
grieved
my
nephew
to
the
heart
,
yet
there
*NL*
was
no
remedy
but
complience
;
in
short
,
all
my
necessaries
were
sent
me
,
*NL*
and
so
this
matter
was
over
in
a
few
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
was
now
near
a
thousand
leagues
farther
off
England
by
sea
,
*NL*
than
at
my
little
kingdom
,
except
this
difference
,
that
I
might
travel
*NL*
by
land
over
the
Great
Mogul
's
country
to
Surat
,
from
thence
to
Baffora
,
*NL*
by
sea
up
the
Persian
Gulph
,
then
take
the
way
of
the
caravans
over
the
*NL*
Arabian
desert
to
Alleppo
and
Scanderoon
,
there
take
shipping
to
Italy
,
*NL*
and
so
travel
by
land
into
France
,
and
from
thence
cross
the
sea
*NL*
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
nephew
left
me
two
persons
to
attend
me
;
one
of
them
was
his
servant
,
*NL*
and
the
other
clerk
to
the
purser
,
who
engaged
to
be
mine
.
I
took
*NL*
lodging
in
an
English
woman
's
house
,
where
several
French
,
one
English
,
*NL*
and
two
Italian
merchants
resided
.
The
handsome
entertainment
I
met
with
*NL*
here
,
occasioned
me
to
stay
nine
months
,
considering
what
course
I
*NL*
should
take
.
Some
English
goods
I
had
with
me
of
great
value
,
besides
a
*NL*
thousand
pieces
of
eight
,
and
a
letter
for
more
,
if
there
was
such
*NL*
necessity
.
The
goods
I
soon
disposed
of
to
advantage
,
and
bought
here
*NL*
several
good
diamonds
,
which
I
could
easily
carry
about
with
me
.
One
*NL*
morning
the
English
merchant
came
to
me
,
as
being
very
intimate
*NL*
together
,
_
countryman
_
,
said
he
,
_
I
have
a
project
to
communicate
to
*NL*
you
,
which
I
hope
will
suit
to
both
our
advantage
.
To
be
short
,
Sir
,
we
*NL*
are
both
in
a
remote
part
of
the
world
from
our
country
;
but
yet
in
a
*NL*
place
where
men
of
business
may
get
a
great
deal
of
money
.
Now
,
if
you
*NL*
will
put
a
thousand
pounds
to
my
thousand
pounds
,
we
will
hire
a
ship
to
*NL*
our
satisfaction
;
you
shall
be
Captain
,
I
will
be
merchant
:
and
we
'll
go
*NL*
a
trading
voyage
to
China
,
for
why
should
we
lie
still
like
drones
,
*NL*
while
the
whole
world
is
in
a
continual
motion
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
proposal
soon
got
my
consent
,
being
very
agreeable
to
my
rambling
*NL*
genius
;
and
the
more
so
,
because
I
looked
upon
my
countryman
to
be
a
*NL*
very
sincere
person
;
it
required
some
time
before
we
could
get
a
vessel
*NL*
to
our
mind
,
and
sailors
to
man
it
accordingly
;
at
length
we
bought
a
*NL*
ship
,
and
got
an
English
mate
,
boatswain
,
and
gunner
,
a
Dutch
carpenter
,
*NL*
and
three
Portuguese
foremast
men
;
and
,
for
want
of
others
,
made
shift
*NL*
with
Indian
seamen
.
We
first
sailed
to
Achin
,
in
the
island
of
Sumatra
,
*NL*
and
then
to
Siam
,
where
we
bartered
our
wares
for
some
arrack
and
opium
,
*NL*
the
last
of
which
bore
a
great
price
among
the
Chinese
;
in
a
word
,
we
*NL*
went
up
to
Suskan
,
making
a
very
great
voyage
;
&
,
after
eight
months
*NL*
time
,
I
returned
to
Bengal
,
very
well
satisfied
with
this
adventure
,
*NL*
having
not
only
got
a
sufficient
quantity
of
money
,
but
an
insight
of
*NL*
getting
a
great
deal
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
voyage
my
friend
proposed
to
me
,
was
to
go
among
the
spice
*NL*
islands
,
and
bring
home
a
load
of
cloves
from
the
Manillas
,
or
*NL*
thereabouts
;
islands
belonging
partly
to
Spain
,
but
where
the
Dutch
*NL*
trade
very
considerably
.
We
were
not
long
in
preparing
for
this
voyage
,
*NL*
which
we
made
no
less
successful
than
the
last
,
touching
at
Borneo
,
and
*NL*
several
other
places
which
I
do
not
perfectly
remember
,
and
returning
*NL*
home
in
about
five
months
time
.
We
soon
sold
our
spices
,
which
were
*NL*
chiefly
cloves
and
some
nutmegs
,
to
the
Persian
merchants
,
who
carried
*NL*
them
away
to
the
gulph
;
and
,
in
short
,
making
five
to
one
advantage
,
we
*NL*
were
loaded
with
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
my
friend
and
I
had
made
up
our
accounts
,
to
our
entire
*NL*
satisfaction
,
there
came
in
a
Dutch
coaster
from
Batavia
of
about
two
*NL*
hundred
tons
.
The
crew
of
this
vessel
pretended
themselves
so
sickly
,
*NL*
that
there
were
not
hands
sufficient
to
undertake
a
voyage
;
and
the
*NL*
Captain
having
given
out
that
he
intended
to
go
to
Europe
,
public
notice
*NL*
was
given
that
the
ship
was
to
be
sold
.
No
sooner
did
this
come
to
our
*NL*
ears
,
but
we
bought
the
ship
,
paid
the
master
,
and
took
possession
.
We
*NL*
would
also
have
very
willingly
entertained
some
of
the
men
;
but
they
*NL*
having
received
their
share
of
booty
,
were
not
to
be
found
,
being
*NL*
altogether
fled
to
Agra
,
the
great
city
of
the
Mogul
's
residence
;
and
*NL*
from
thence
went
to
travel
to
Surat
,
and
so
by
the
sea
to
the
Persian
*NL*
Gulph
.
And
indeed
they
had
reason
to
fly
in
this
manner
;
for
the
truth
*NL*
of
it
was
the
pretended
Captain
was
the
gunner
only
,
and
not
the
*NL*
commander
;
that
having
been
on
a
trading
voyage
,
they
were
attacked
on
*NL*
shore
by
the
Malayans
,
who
killed
three
men
and
the
Captain
;
after
whose
*NL*
death
the
other
eleven
men
ran
away
with
the
ship
to
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
*NL*
and
left
the
mate
and
five
men
more
on
shore
:
but
of
this
affair
we
*NL*
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
more
at
length
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
they
came
by
the
ship
,
we
thought
we
bought
it
honestly
;
neither
*NL*
did
we
suspect
any
thing
of
the
matter
,
when
the
man
showed
us
a
bill
of
*NL*
sale
for
the
ship
-LRB-
undoubtedly
forged
-RRB-
to
one
Emanuel
Clostershoven
,
*NL*
which
name
he
went
by
.
And
so
without
any
more
to
do
,
we
picked
up
some
*NL*
Dutch
and
English
seamen
,
resolving
for
another
voyage
for
cloves
among
*NL*
the
Phillippine
and
Molucca
Islands
:
in
short
,
we
continued
thus
five
or
*NL*
six
years
,
trading
from
port
to
port
with
extraordinary
success
.
In
the
*NL*
seventh
year
,
we
undertook
a
voyage
to
China
,
designing
to
touch
at
*NL*
Siam
,
and
buy
some
rice
by
the
way
.
In
this
voyage
,
contrary
winds
beat
*NL*
us
up
and
down
for
a
considerable
time
among
the
islands
in
the
Straits
*NL*
of
Molucca
.
No
sooner
were
we
clear
of
those
rugged
seas
,
but
we
*NL*
perceived
our
ship
had
sprung
a
leak
,
which
obliged
us
to
put
into
the
*NL*
river
Cambodia
,
which
lies
northward
of
the
Gulph
,
and
goes
up
to
Siam
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
I
was
on
shore
refreshing
myself
,
there
comes
to
me
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
who
was
gunner
's
mate
on
board
an
English
East
India
ship
,
*NL*
riding
up
the
river
near
the
city
of
Cambodia
.
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
you
may
*NL*
wonder
at
my
business
,
having
never
seen
me
in
your
life
;
but
tho
'
I
am
*NL*
a
stranger
,
I
have
something
to
tell
you
that
very
nearly
concerns
you
:
*NL*
&
indeed
it
is
the
imminent
danger
you
are
in
has
moved
me
to
give
you
*NL*
this
timely
notice
_
.
``
Danger
!
''
said
I
,
``
what
danger
?
I
know
of
none
,
*NL*
except
my
ship
being
leaky
,
for
which
I
design
to
have
her
run
aground
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
''
_
I
hope
you
will
be
better
employed
when
you
shall
*NL*
hear
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
You
know
the
town
of
Cambodia
is
about
*NL*
fifteen
leagues
up
this
river
;
about
three
leagues
on
this
side
of
it
,
*NL*
there
lie
two
Dutch
and
three
English
ships
.
And
would
you
venture
here
*NL*
without
considering
what
strength
you
have
to
engage
them
_
?
I
knew
not
*NL*
what
he
meant
by
this
discourse
,
and
turning
short
upon
him
,
``
Sir
,
''
said
*NL*
I
,
``
I
know
no
reason
I
have
to
be
afraid
either
of
any
Dutch
or
English
*NL*
ships
.
I
am
no
interloper
,
and
what
business
have
they
with
me
?
''
_
Well
,
*NL*
Sir
,
_
said
the
man
,
_
if
you
do
think
yourselves
secure
,
all
as
I
can
*NL*
say
,
you
must
take
your
chance
;
however
,
I
am
very
sorry
you
are
so
deaf
*NL*
to
good
advice
;
but
I
assure
you
;
if
you
do
not
put
to
sea
immediately
,
*NL*
you
will
be
attacked
by
five
long-boats
full
of
men
,
hanged
yourself
for
*NL*
a
pirate
,
if
you
are
taken
,
and
the
particulars
examined
afterwards
.
I
*NL*
thought
,
Sir
_
,
added
he
,
_
I
might
have
met
a
better
reception
for
such
a
*NL*
singular
piece
of
service
_
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
was
never
ungrateful
to
*NL*
any
man
;
but
pray
explain
yourself
and
I
'll
go
on
board
this
minute
,
*NL*
whether
the
leak
be
stopped
or
no
.
''
_
Why
,
Sir
,
_
said
he
,
_
to
be
short
,
*NL*
because
time
is
precious
,
the
matter
is
this
:
You
know
well
enough
that
*NL*
you
was
with
the
ship
at
Sumatra
,
when
your
Captain
was
murdered
by
the
*NL*
Malayans
,
with
three
of
his
sailors
;
and
that
either
you
,
or
some
who
*NL*
were
on
board
you
,
ran
away
with
the
ship
,
and
are
since
turned
pirates
*NL*
at
sea
.
Now
,
Sir
,
this
is
the
sum
of
what
I
had
to
say
:
and
I
can
*NL*
positively
assure
you
,
that
if
you
are
taken
,
you
will
be
executed
*NL*
without
much
ceremony
,
for
undoubtedly
you
can
not
but
be
sensible
what
*NL*
little
law
merchant
ships
show
to
pirates
,
whenever
they
fall
into
*NL*
their
hands
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
thank
you
for
your
kind
information
;
and
though
I
am
*NL*
sure
no
man
could
come
more
honestly
by
the
ship
than
I
have
done
,
yet
*NL*
knowing
their
enterprize
,
and
being
satisfied
of
your
honest
intention
,
*NL*
I
'll
be
upon
my
defence
.
_
Pr
`
ythee
,
Sir
,
_
said
the
man
,
_
do
n't
talk
of
*NL*
being
upon
your
defence
,
the
best
that
you
can
make
is
to
be
out
of
*NL*
danger
;
and
therefore
,
if
you
have
any
regard
for
your
life
,
&
the
lives
*NL*
of
your
men
,
take
the
advantage
,
without
fail
,
of
putting
out
to
sea
at
*NL*
high-water
:
by
which
means
,
as
you
have
a
whole
tide
before
you
,
you
*NL*
will
be
gone
too
far
out
of
their
reach
before
they
can
come
down
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
mighty
well
satisfied
,
''
said
I
,
``
in
this
particular
,
and
for
your
*NL*
kindness
,
which
merits
my
great
esteem
;
pray
,
Sir
,
what
amends
shall
I
*NL*
make
you
?
''
He
replied
,
``
I
know
not
what
amends
you
are
willing
to
make
,
*NL*
because
you
may
have
some
doubts
of
its
certainty
:
but
,
to
convince
you
*NL*
of
the
truth
of
what
I
say
,
I
have
one
offer
to
make
to
you
.
On
board
*NL*
one
of
the
English
ships
,
I
have
nineteen
months
pay
due
to
me
,
and
this
*NL*
Dutchman
that
is
with
me
has
seven
months
pay
due
to
him
,
which
if
you
*NL*
will
make
good
to
us
,
we
will
go
along
with
you
.
If
you
shall
find
that
*NL*
there
is
nothing
in
what
we
have
said
,
then
we
shall
desire
nothing
;
but
*NL*
when
you
are
convinced
that
we
have
saved
the
ship
,
your
life
,
and
the
*NL*
lives
of
the
men
,
we
will
leave
the
whole
to
your
generosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
reasonable
did
this
every
way
appear
,
that
I
immediately
consented
,
*NL*
and
we
went
directly
on
board
.
As
soon
as
we
came
on
board
,
my
partner
*NL*
calls
joyfully
out
,
_
That
they
had
stopped
the
leak
?
_
``
Well
,
thank
God
,
''
*NL*
said
I
,
``
but
pray
let
us
weigh
anchor
forthwith
.
''
--
_
Weigh
,
_
said
he
,
*NL*
_
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
hurry
_
?
``
Pray
ask
no
questions
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
but
all
hands
to
work
,
without
losing
a
moment
's
time
.
''
Upon
which
,
in
*NL*
great
surprise
,
the
Captain
was
called
,
who
immediately
ordered
the
*NL*
anchor
to
be
got
up
;
and
though
the
tide
was
not
quite
down
,
yet
being
*NL*
assisted
with
a
little
land
breeze
,
we
stood
to
sea
.
I
then
called
my
*NL*
partner
into
the
cabin
,
and
related
the
story
at
large
,
which
was
*NL*
confirmed
and
more
amplified
by
the
two
men
I
had
brought
on
board
.
*NL*
Scarce
had
we
finished
our
discourse
upon
this
head
,
but
a
sailor
came
*NL*
to
the
cabin
door
,
with
a
message
from
the
Captain
,
that
we
were
chased
*NL*
by
five
sloops
full
of
armed
men
.
``
Very
well
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
is
plain
now
*NL*
there
is
something
in
it
.
''
And
so
,
going
upon
deck
,
I
told
all
the
men
*NL*
there
was
a
design
for
seizing
the
ship
,
and
of
executing
us
for
*NL*
pirates
;
and
asked
them
whether
they
would
faithfully
stand
by
us
,
and
*NL*
by
one
another
?
To
which
they
unanimously
replied
,
``
That
they
would
*NL*
fight
to
their
last
drop
of
blood
.
''
I
then
asked
the
Captain
,
which
way
*NL*
he
thought
best
for
us
to
manage
the
battle
?
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
the
only
*NL*
method
is
to
keep
them
off
with
our
great
shot
as
long
as
we
are
able
,
*NL*
and
then
have
recourse
to
our
small
arms
:
and
when
both
these
fail
us
,
*NL*
then
retire
to
close
quarters
,
when
perhaps
the
enemy
wanting
materials
,
*NL*
can
neither
break
open
our
bulk
heads
,
nor
get
in
upon
us
_
.
Meantime
,
*NL*
the
gunner
was
ordered
to
bring
two
guns
to
bear
fore
and
aft
out
of
the
*NL*
steerage
,
and
so
load
them
with
musket-bullets
and
small
pieces
of
old
*NL*
iron
;
and
the
deck
being
cleared
,
we
prepared
for
the
engagement
,
still
,
*NL*
however
,
keeping
out
at
sea
.
The
boats
followed
us
,
with
all
the
sail
*NL*
they
could
make
,
and
we
could
perceive
the
two
foremost
were
English
,
*NL*
which
out-sailed
the
rest
by
two
leagues
,
and
which
we
found
would
come
*NL*
up
with
us
:
hereupon
,
we
fired
a
gun
without
a
ball
,
intimating
that
*NL*
they
should
bring
to
,
and
we
put
out
a
flag
of
truce
,
as
a
signal
for
*NL*
parley
;
but
finding
them
crowding
after
us
,
till
they
came
within
shot
,
*NL*
we
took
in
our
white
,
and
hanging
out
the
red
flap
,
immediately
fired
at
*NL*
them
with
ball
:
we
then
called
to
them
with
a
speaking
trumpet
,
bidding
*NL*
them
at
their
peril
keep
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
signified
nothing
;
for
depending
upon
the
strength
that
*NL*
followed
them
,
they
were
resolutely
bent
for
mischief
:
hereupon
I
*NL*
ordered
them
to
bring
the
ship
to
,
by
which
means
,
they
lying
upon
our
*NL*
broadside
,
we
let
fly
at
them
at
once
,
one
of
whom
carried
away
the
*NL*
stern
of
the
hindermost
boat
,
and
obliged
them
not
only
to
take
down
*NL*
their
sail
,
but
made
them
all
run
to
the
head
of
the
boat
,
to
keep
them
*NL*
from
sinking
,
and
so
she
lay
by
,
having
enough
of
it
.
In
the
meantime
,
*NL*
we
prepared
to
welcome
the
foremost
boat
in
the
same
manner
.
While
we
*NL*
were
doing
this
,
one
of
the
three
hindermost
boats
came
up
to
the
relief
*NL*
of
that
which
was
disabled
,
and
took
the
men
out
of
her
.
We
again
*NL*
called
to
parley
with
them
;
but
,
instead
of
an
answer
,
one
of
the
boats
*NL*
came
close
under
our
stern
;
whereupon
our
gunner
let
fly
his
two
chase
*NL*
guns
,
but
missing
,
the
men
in
the
boat
shouted
,
and
,
waving
their
caps
,
*NL*
came
on
with
greater
fury
.
To
repair
this
seeming
disgrace
,
the
gunner
*NL*
soon
got
ready
,
and
firing
a
second
time
,
did
a
great
deal
of
mischief
*NL*
among
the
enemy
.
We
waved
again
,
and
,
bringing
our
quarter
to
bear
upon
*NL*
them
,
fired
three
guns
more
,
when
we
found
the
boat
a
sinking
,
and
*NL*
several
men
already
in
the
sea
;
hereupon
,
manning
our
pinnace
,
I
gave
*NL*
orders
to
save
as
many
as
they
could
,
and
instantly
to
come
on
board
,
*NL*
because
the
rest
of
their
boats
were
approaching
:
accordingly
they
did
*NL*
so
,
and
took
up
three
of
them
,
one
of
whom
was
almost
past
recovery
;
and
*NL*
then
crowding
all
the
sail
we
could
,
after
our
men
came
on
board
,
we
*NL*
stood
out
farther
to
sea
,
so
that
the
other
three
boats
gave
over
the
*NL*
chase
,
when
they
came
up
to
the
first
two
.
Thus
delivered
from
imminent
*NL*
danger
,
we
changed
our
course
to
the
eastward
,
quite
out
of
the
course
*NL*
of
all
European
ships
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
now
at
sea
,
and
inquiring
more
particularly
of
the
two
seamen
,
the
*NL*
meaning
of
all
this
,
the
Dutchman
at
once
let
us
into
the
secret
.
He
*NL*
told
us
,
that
the
fellow
who
sold
us
the
ship
was
an
errant
thief
,
who
*NL*
had
run
away
with
her
;
that
the
Captain
was
treacherously
murdered
on
*NL*
the
coast
of
Molucca
by
the
natives
there
,
with
three
of
his
men
;
that
*NL*
he
,
the
Dutchman
,
and
four
more
,
being
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
*NL*
woods
for
their
safety
,
at
length
escaped
by
means
of
a
Dutch
ship
in
*NL*
its
way
to
China
,
which
had
sent
their
boat
on
shore
for
fresh
water
:
*NL*
That
,
after
this
,
he
went
to
Batavia
,
where
two
of
the
seamen
belonging
*NL*
to
the
ship
-LRB-
who
had
deserted
the
rest
in
their
travels
-RRB-
arrived
,
and
*NL*
there
gave
an
account
that
the
fellow
who
ran
away
with
the
ship
had
*NL*
sold
her
at
Bengal
to
a
set
of
pirates
,
who
went
a
cruising
,
and
had
*NL*
already
taken
one
English
and
two
Dutch
ship
,
richly
laden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
tho
'
this
was
absolutely
false
,
my
partner
truly
said
,
that
our
*NL*
deliverance
was
to
be
esteemed
so
much
the
more
,
by
reason
,
had
we
*NL*
fallen
into
their
hands
,
we
could
have
expected
nothing
from
them
but
*NL*
immediate
death
,
considering
our
accusers
would
have
been
our
judges
;
*NL*
and
,
therefore
,
his
opinion
was
to
return
directly
to
Bengal
,
where
,
*NL*
being
known
,
we
could
prove
how
honestly
we
came
by
the
ship
,
of
whom
we
*NL*
bought
her
,
and
the
like
,
and
where
we
were
sure
of
some
justice
;
at
*NL*
least
would
not
be
hanged
first
,
and
judged
afterwards
.
I
was
at
first
*NL*
of
my
partner
's
opinion
,
but
when
I
had
more
seriously
considered
of
the
*NL*
matter
,
I
told
him
,
we
ran
a
great
hazard
in
attempting
to
return
,
being
*NL*
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
Straits
of
Molucca
and
that
,
if
,
upon
alarm
*NL*
given
,
we
should
be
taken
by
the
Dutch
at
Batavia
,
or
English
elsewhere
,
*NL*
our
turning
away
would
be
a
sufficient
evidence
to
condemn
us
.
This
*NL*
danger
indeed
startled
not
only
my
partner
,
but
likewise
all
the
ship
's
*NL*
company
;
so
we
changed
our
former
resolution
,
and
resolved
to
go
to
the
*NL*
coast
of
Tonquin
,
and
so
to
that
of
China
,
where
,
pursuing
our
first
*NL*
design
as
to
trade
,
we
might
likewise
have
an
opportunity
to
dispose
of
*NL*
the
ship
some
way
or
other
,
and
to
return
to
Bengal
in
any
country
*NL*
vessel
we
could
procure
.
This
being
agreed
to
,
we
steered
away
N.N.E.
*NL*
about
50
leagues
off
the
usual
course
to
the
east
;
which
put
us
to
some
*NL*
inconveniences
.
As
the
wind
blew
steadily
against
us
,
our
voyage
became
*NL*
more
tedious
,
and
we
began
to
be
afraid
of
want
of
provision
;
and
what
*NL*
was
still
worse
,
we
apprehended
,
that
as
those
ships
from
whose
boat
we
*NL*
had
escaped
,
were
bound
to
China
,
they
might
get
before
us
,
and
have
*NL*
given
fresh
information
,
which
might
create
another
vigorous
pursuit
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
could
not
help
being
grieved
,
when
I
considered
that
I
who
had
*NL*
never
wronged
or
defrauded
any
person
in
my
life
,
was
now
pursued
like
a
*NL*
common
thief
,
and
if
taken
to
run
the
greatest
danger
of
being
executed
*NL*
as
such
;
and
,
though
innocent
,
I
found
myself
under
the
necessity
of
*NL*
flying
for
my
safety
;
and
thereby
escape
being
brought
to
shame
,
of
*NL*
which
I
was
even
more
afraid
than
death
itself
.
It
was
easy
to
read
my
*NL*
dejection
in
my
countenance
.
My
mind
was
oppressed
,
like
those
unhappy
*NL*
innocent
persons
,
who
being
overpowered
by
blasphemous
and
perjured
*NL*
evidences
,
wickedly
resolved
to
take
away
their
lives
,
or
ruin
their
*NL*
reputation
,
have
no
other
recourse
in
this
world
to
ease
their
sorrow
,
*NL*
but
sighs
,
prayers
,
and
tears
.
My
partner
seeing
me
so
concerned
,
*NL*
encouraged
me
as
well
as
he
could
;
and
,
after
describing
to
me
the
*NL*
several
ports
of
that
coast
,
he
told
me
,
he
would
either
put
me
in
on
*NL*
the
coast
of
Cochinchina
,
or
else
in
the
bay
of
Tonquin
,
from
whence
we
*NL*
might
go
to
Macao
,
a
town
once
possessed
by
the
Portuguese
,
and
where
*NL*
still
many
European
families
resided
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
place
we
steered
,
and
,
early
next
morning
,
came
in
sight
of
the
*NL*
coast
;
but
thought
it
advisable
to
put
into
a
small
river
where
we
*NL*
could
,
either
over
land
,
or
by
the
ship
's
pinnace
,
know
what
vessels
*NL*
were
in
any
ports
thereabouts
.
This
happy
step
proved
our
deliverance
;
*NL*
for
,
next
morning
,
there
came
to
the
bay
of
Tonquin
two
Dutch
ships
,
and
*NL*
a
third
without
any
colours
;
and
in
the
evening
,
two
English
ships
*NL*
steered
the
same
course
.
The
river
where
we
were
was
but
small
,
and
ran
*NL*
but
a
few
leagues
up
the
country
northward
;
the
country
was
wild
and
*NL*
barbarous
,
and
the
people
thieves
,
having
no
correspondence
with
any
*NL*
other
nation
;
dealing
only
in
fish
,
oil
,
and
such
gross
commodities
:
and
*NL*
one
barbarous
custom
they
still
retained
,
that
when
any
vessel
was
*NL*
unhappily
shipwrecked
upon
their
coast
,
they
make
the
men
prisoners
or
*NL*
slaves
,
so
that
now
we
might
fairly
say
we
were
surrounded
by
enemies
*NL*
both
by
sea
and
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
ship
had
been
leaky
,
we
took
the
opportunity
,
in
this
place
to
*NL*
search
her
,
and
to
stop
up
the
places
which
let
in
the
water
.
We
*NL*
accordingly
lightened
her
,
and
bringing
our
guns
and
other
moveable
*NL*
things
to
one
side
,
we
essayed
to
bring
her
down
,
that
we
might
come
to
*NL*
her
bottom
:
but
,
upon
second
consideration
,
we
did
not
think
it
safe
to
*NL*
let
her
lie
on
dry
ground
,
neither
indeed
was
the
place
convenient
for
*NL*
it
.
The
inhabitants
not
used
to
such
a
sight
as
to
see
a
ship
lie
down
*NL*
on
one
side
;
and
heel
in
towards
the
shore
,
and
not
perceiving
her
men
,
*NL*
who
were
at
work
on
her
bottom
,
with
stages
and
boats
on
the
off
side
,
*NL*
presently
imagined
the
ship
had
been
cast
away
,
and
lay
fast
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
Agreeable
to
this
supposition
,
they
surrounded
us
with
ten
or
*NL*
twelve
large
boats
,
with
a
resolution
,
undoubtedly
to
plunder
the
ship
,
*NL*
and
to
carry
away
those
they
found
alive
for
slaves
to
their
king
.
But
*NL*
when
they
perceived
our
men
hard
at
work
on
the
ship
's
bottom
and
side
,
*NL*
washing
,
graving
,
and
stopping
her
,
it
filled
them
all
with
such
*NL*
surprise
,
that
they
stood
gazing
as
though
they
were
confounded
.
Nor
*NL*
could
we
imagine
what
their
design
was
;
however
,
for
fear
of
danger
,
we
*NL*
handed
down
arms
and
ammunition
to
those
at
work
,
in
order
to
defend
*NL*
themselves
;
and
,
indeed
,
this
precaution
was
absolutely
necessary
;
for
,
*NL*
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
,
the
natives
,
concluding
it
was
really
a
*NL*
shipwreck
,
and
that
we
were
saving
our
lives
and
goods
,
which
they
*NL*
thought
belonged
to
them
,
came
down
upon
our
men
as
though
it
had
been
*NL*
in
line
of
battle
.
We
lay
at
present
but
in
a
very
unfit
posture
to
*NL*
fight
;
and
before
the
stages
could
be
got
down
,
or
the
men
in
the
boat
*NL*
come
on
board
as
they
were
ordered
,
the
Cochinchinese
were
upon
them
,
*NL*
and
two
of
their
boats
boarding
our
long
boat
,
they
began
to
lay
hold
of
*NL*
our
men
as
prisoners
.
The
first
they
seized
was
a
stout
English
sailor
,
*NL*
who
never
fired
his
musket
,
like
a
fool
,
as
I
imagined
,
but
laid
it
down
*NL*
in
the
boat
:
but
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
;
for
,
by
main
force
,
he
*NL*
dragged
the
Pagan
out
of
the
boat
into
ours
by
the
two
ears
,
and
knocked
*NL*
his
brains
out
against
the
boat
's
gunnel
;
a
Dutchman
that
was
next
him
,
*NL*
snatched
up
the
musket
,
and
knocked
down
five
more
with
the
but-end
of
*NL*
it
;
however
,
this
was
doing
very
little
to
their
number
;
but
a
strange
*NL*
unexpected
accident
,
which
rather
merits
laughter
than
any
thing
else
,
*NL*
gave
our
men
a
complete
victory
over
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
the
carpenter
,
who
was
preparing
to
grave
the
outside
of
the
*NL*
ship
,
as
well
as
to
pay
the
seams
,
where
he
caulked
to
stop
the
leaks
,
*NL*
had
gotten
two
kettles
just
let
down
in
the
boat
,
one
filled
with
*NL*
boiling
pitch
,
and
the
other
with
rosin
,
tallow
,
oil
,
and
such
stuffs
as
*NL*
the
shipwrights
use
;
the
carpenter
's
man
had
a
great
iron
ladle
with
*NL*
which
he
used
to
supply
the
workmen
with
hot
stuff
,
&
as
two
of
the
*NL*
enemies
entered
the
boat
where
the
fellow
stood
,
he
saluted
them
with
a
*NL*
full
ladle
of
the
hot
boiling
liquor
;
which
,
the
poor
creatures
being
*NL*
half
naked
,
made
them
roar
out
,
and
jump
into
the
sea
.
_
Well
done
,
*NL*
Jack
_
,
says
the
carpenter
,
_
give
them
the
other
dose
_
:
and
so
stepping
*NL*
forward
himself
,
takes
a
mop
,
and
dipping
it
into
the
pitch-pot
,
he
and
*NL*
his
man
so
plentifully
flung
it
among
them
,
as
that
none
escaped
being
*NL*
scalded
;
upon
which
they
all
made
the
best
of
their
way
,
crying
and
*NL*
howling
in
such
a
frightful
manner
,
that
,
in
all
my
adventures
,
I
never
*NL*
heard
the
like
.
And
,
indeed
,
never
was
I
better
pleased
with
any
*NL*
conquest
than
I
was
with
this
,
there
being
so
little
bloodshed
,
and
*NL*
having
an
aversion
to
killing
such
savage
wretches
,
-LRB-
more
than
was
*NL*
necessary
-RRB-
as
knowing
they
came
on
errands
,
which
their
laws
and
customs
*NL*
made
them
think
were
just
and
equitable
.
By
this
time
,
all
things
being
*NL*
in
order
,
and
the
ship
swimming
,
they
found
their
mistake
,
so
they
did
*NL*
not
venture
a
second
attack
.
Thus
ended
our
merry
fight
;
and
,
having
got
*NL*
rice
,
bread
,
roots
,
and
sixteen
good
hogs
on
board
the
day
before
we
set
*NL*
sail
,
not
daring
to
go
into
the
bay
of
Tonquin
,
but
steering
N.E.
toward
*NL*
the
isle
of
Formosa
,
or
as
tho
'
we
would
go
to
the
Manillas
,
or
*NL*
Phillippine
islands
,
for
fear
of
meeting
with
any
European
ships
;
when
*NL*
we
anchored
at
the
isle
of
Formosa
,
the
inhabitants
not
only
courteously
*NL*
supplied
us
with
provisions
and
fresh
water
,
but
dealt
very
fairly
and
*NL*
honestly
with
us
in
their
bargains
and
agreements
.
From
this
place
we
*NL*
steered
north
,
keeping
still
off
the
coast
of
China
,
till
we
were
beyond
*NL*
all
its
ports
where
European
ships
usually
come
;
and
,
at
length
,
being
*NL*
come
to
the
latitude
of
thirty
degrees
,
we
resolved
to
put
into
the
*NL*
first
trading
port
we
should
come
at
;
and
standing
for
the
shore
,
a
boat
*NL*
came
off
two
leagues
to
us
,
with
an
old
Portuguese
pilot
on
board
,
who
*NL*
offered
his
service
;
we
very
gladly
accepted
him
,
and
sent
the
boat
back
*NL*
again
.
And
now
,
having
the
man
on
board
,
I
talked
to
him
of
going
to
*NL*
Nanquin
,
the
most
northward
part
of
the
coast
of
China
.
_
What
will
you
*NL*
do
there
_
?
said
he
,
smiling
.
I
told
him
that
we
would
sell
our
cargo
,
*NL*
and
purchase
calicoes
,
raw
and
wrought
silks
,
tea
,
&
c.
and
so
return
the
*NL*
same
way
back
.
_
O
_
,
said
he
,
_
you
had
better
put
in
at
Macao
,
where
you
*NL*
may
buy
China
wares
as
cheap
as
at
Nanquin
,
and
sell
your
opium
at
a
*NL*
greater
advance
_
.
``
But
'
said
I
`
we
are
gentlemen
as
well
as
merchants
,
*NL*
and
design
to
see
the
great
city
of
Pekin
,
and
the
magnificent
court
of
*NL*
the
monarch
of
China
,
''
_
Why
then
_
,
said
he
,
_
you
should
go
to
Ningpo
,
*NL*
where
is
a
navigable
river
that
goes
through
the
heart
of
that
vast
*NL*
empire
,
two
hundred
and
seventy
leagues
from
the
sea
,
which
crosses
all
*NL*
the
rivers
,
passes
considerable
hills
,
by
the
help
of
the
sluices
and
*NL*
gates
,
and
goes
even
up
to
the
city
of
Pekin
.
You
may
go
to
Nanquin
if
*NL*
you
please
,
and
travel
to
Pekin
,
and
there
is
a
Dutch
ship
just
before
*NL*
bound
that
way
_
.
At
the
name
of
a
Dutch
or
English
ship
,
I
was
struck
*NL*
with
confusion
;
they
being
as
great
a
terror
to
me
in
this
vessel
,
as
an
*NL*
Algerine
man
of
war
is
to
them
in
the
Mediterranean
.
The
old
man
finding
*NL*
me
troubled
,
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
I
hope
the
Dutch
are
not
now
at
war
with
*NL*
your
nation
_
.
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
God
knows
what
liberty
they
may
take
*NL*
when
out
of
the
reach
of
the
law
.
''
_
Why
_
,
says
he
_
what
occasion
is
*NL*
there
for
peaceable
merchants
to
fear
?
For
believe
me
,
they
never
meddle
*NL*
with
any
but
PIRATES
.

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
mentioning
the
word
_
pirates
_
,
my
countenance
turned
to
that
of
*NL*
scarlet
;
nor
was
it
possible
for
me
to
conceal
it
from
the
old
pilot
;
*NL*
who
was
taking
notice
of
it
,
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
_
take
what
course
you
*NL*
please
,
I
'll
do
you
all
the
service
I
can
.
_
``
Seignior
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
a
*NL*
little
concerned
at
your
mentioning
pirates
;
I
hope
there
are
none
such
*NL*
in
these
seas
,
because
you
see
in
what
weak
condition
we
are
to
defend
*NL*
ourselves
.
''
_
O
,
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
if
that
's
all
,
do
n't
be
concerned
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
remember
one
in
these
seas
these
fifteen
years
,
except
above
a
*NL*
month
ago
one
was
seen
in
the
bay
of
Siam
,
but
he
is
gone
to
the
*NL*
southward
;
neither
was
she
built
for
a
privateer
,
but
was
run
away
with
*NL*
by
a
reprobate
Captain
,
and
some
of
his
men
,
the
right
Captain
having
*NL*
been
murdered
by
the
Malayans
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
said
I
,
-LRB-
as
though
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
-RRB-
``
did
they
kill
*NL*
the
Captain
?
''
_
No
_
,
said
he
,
_
it
is
generally
thought
the
Malayans
*NL*
murdered
him
;
but
they
justly
deserve
hanging
.
The
rogues
were
lately
*NL*
discovered
in
the
bay
of
Siam
,
in
the
river
of
Cambodia
,
by
some
*NL*
Dutchmen
who
belonged
to
the
ship
,
and
had
much
ado
to
escape
the
five
*NL*
boats
that
pursued
them
,
but
they
have
solemnly
sworn
to
give
no
quarter
*NL*
to
the
Captain
or
the
seamen
but
hang
them
every
one
up
at
the
yard-arm
,
*NL*
without
any
formal
business
of
bringing
them
to
a
court
of
judicature
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
sensible
,
that
,
having
the
old
man
on
board
,
he
was
incapable
of
*NL*
doing
me
any
mischief
,
``
Well
,
Seignior
,
-LRB-
said
I
-RRB-
it
is
for
this
very
*NL*
reason
I
would
have
you
carry
us
up
to
Nanquin
,
where
neither
English
*NL*
nor
Dutch
ships
come
;
and
I
must
tell
you
,
their
Captains
are
a
parcel
*NL*
of
rash
,
proud
,
insolent
rascals
,
that
neither
know
what
belongs
to
*NL*
justice
,
nor
how
to
behave
themselves
as
the
laws
of
God
or
nature
*NL*
direct
;
fellows
that
would
prove
murderers
to
punish
robbers
,
and
take
*NL*
upon
them
to
adjudge
innocent
men
to
death
,
without
any
proof
to
prove
*NL*
them
guilty
,
but
perhaps
I
may
live
to
call
them
to
account
for
it
,
in
a
*NL*
place
where
they
may
be
taught
how
justice
is
to
be
executed
.
''
And
so
I
*NL*
told
him
all
the
story
of
buying
the
ship
,
and
how
we
were
saved
by
the
*NL*
means
of
two
men
;
that
the
murder
of
the
Captain
by
the
Malayans
,
as
*NL*
also
the
running
away
with
the
ship
,
I
believed
to
be
true
;
but
that
*NL*
we
,
who
bought
it
,
were
turned
pirates
,
was
a
mere
fiction
to
cover
*NL*
their
cowardice
and
foolish
behaviour
,
when
they
attacked
us
,
&
the
*NL*
blood
of
those
men
we
killed
in
our
own
just
defence
,
lay
at
their
door
,
*NL*
who
sent
to
attack
us
by
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
-LRB-
said
the
old
man
,
amazed
-RRB-
you
have
taken
the
right
course
to
*NL*
steer
to
the
north
,
and
,
if
I
might
advise
you
,
I
would
have
you
sell
*NL*
your
ship
in
China
,
and
buy
or
build
another
in
that
country
;
and
I
'll
*NL*
procure
people
to
buy
the
one
and
sell
the
other
.
''
``
Well
,
but
,
Seignior
,
*NL*
-LRB-
said
I
-RRB-
if
I
sell
the
ship
in
this
manner
,
I
may
bring
some
innocent
*NL*
persons
into
the
same
dangers
I
have
gone
through
,
perhaps
worse
,
even
*NL*
death
itself
;
whereby
I
should
be
as
guilty
of
their
murder
as
their
*NL*
villainous
executioners
.
''
``
That
need
not
trouble
you
,
-LRB-
says
the
old
man
-RRB-
*NL*
I
'll
find
a
way
to
prevent
that
;
for
these
commanders
you
talk
of
I
know
*NL*
very
well
,
and
will
inform
them
rightly
of
the
matter
as
you
have
*NL*
related
,
and
I
am
persuaded
they
will
not
only
believe
me
,
but
act
more
*NL*
cautiously
for
the
future
.
''
``
And
will
you
deliver
one
message
from
me
to
*NL*
them
?
''
``
Yes
,
-LRB-
said
he
-RRB-
if
you
will
give
it
under
your
hand
,
that
I
may
*NL*
prove
it
is
not
of
my
own
production
,
''
Hereupon
I
wrote
a
large
account
*NL*
of
their
attacking
me
in
their
long-boat
,
the
pretended
reason
and
*NL*
unjust
design
of
it
;
that
they
had
done
what
they
might
be
ashamed
of
,
*NL*
and
could
not
answer
for
at
any
tribunal
in
England
.
But
this
letter
was
*NL*
writ
in
vain
.
Providence
ordered
things
another
way
.
We
sailed
directly
*NL*
for
Nanquin
,
and
in
about
thirteen
day
's
sail
,
came
to
an
anchor
at
the
*NL*
south-west
point
of
the
great
gulf
of
that
place
,
where
we
learned
,
that
*NL*
two
Dutch
ships
were
gone
the
length
before
us
,
and
that
we
should
*NL*
certainly
fall
into
their
hands
.
We
were
all
at
a
great
loss
in
this
*NL*
exigency
,
and
would
very
gladly
have
been
on
shore
almost
any
where
;
but
*NL*
our
old
pilot
told
me
,
that
if
I
would
sail
to
the
southward
about
two
*NL*
and
forty
leagues
,
there
was
a
little
port
called
Quinchange
,
where
no
*NL*
European
ships
ever
came
,
and
where
we
might
consider
what
was
further
*NL*
to
be
done
.
Accordingly
we
weighed
anchor
the
next
day
,
calling
only
*NL*
twice
on
shore
by
the
way
to
get
fresh
water
.
The
country
people
very
*NL*
courteously
sold
us
roots
,
tea
,
rice
,
fowls
,
and
other
provisions
.
After
*NL*
five
days
sail
we
came
to
the
port
,
and
landed
with
unspeakable
joy
.
We
*NL*
resolved
to
dispose
of
ourselves
and
effects
in
any
other
way
possible
,
*NL*
than
enter
on
board
that
ill-fated
vessel
more
;
for
no
state
can
be
more
*NL*
miserable
than
a
continued
fear
,
which
is
a
life
of
death
,
a
confounder
*NL*
of
our
understandings
,
that
sets
the
imagination
at
work
to
form
a
*NL*
thousand
frightful
things
that
may
never
happen
.
And
we
scarce
slept
one
*NL*
night
without
dreaming
of
halters
,
yard-arms
,
or
gibbets
,
of
fighting
,
*NL*
being
taken
,
and
being
killed
;
nay
,
so
violent
were
our
apprehensions
,
*NL*
that
we
would
bruise
our
hands
and
heads
against
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
cabin
,
as
though
actually
engaged
.
The
story
of
the
Dutch
cruelty
at
*NL*
Amboyns
,
often
came
into
our
thoughts
when
awake
;
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
*NL*
thought
my
condition
very
hard
;
that
after
so
many
difficulties
and
such
*NL*
signal
deliverances
,
I
should
be
hanged
in
my
old
age
,
though
innocent
*NL*
of
any
crime
that
deserved
such
punishment
;
but
then
religion
would
seem
*NL*
to
represent
to
me
,
as
though
the
voice
of
it
had
said
;
`
consider
,
O
*NL*
man
!
what
sins
you
have
been
formerly
guilty
of
;
which
now
thou
art
*NL*
called
to
an
account
for
,
to
expiate
with
thy
blood
!
And
as
to
thy
*NL*
innocence
,
what
art
thou
more
innocent
than
thy
blessed
Redeemer
,
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
,
who
suffered
for
thy
offences
,
and
to
whose
providence
you
ought
*NL*
to
submit
,
let
what
will
happen
?
'
After
this
,
natural
courage
would
*NL*
inspire
me
to
resist
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
,
and
sooner
die
than
*NL*
suffer
myself
to
be
taken
by
boorish
,
rascally
Dutchmen
,
who
had
arts
to
*NL*
torment
beyond
death
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
thank
kind
Heaven
,
being
ashore
;
our
old
pilot
procured
us
a
*NL*
lodging
and
a
warehouse
for
our
goods
;
it
was
a
little
hut
with
a
large
*NL*
warehouse
joining
to
it
,
all
built
with
canes
,
and
pallisadoed
round
*NL*
with
large
ones
,
to
keep
out
pilfering
thieves
,
which
are
very
numerous
*NL*
in
that
country
.
The
magistrates
allowed
us
a
little
guard
during
the
*NL*
night
,
and
we
employed
a
centinel
with
a
kind
of
halbert
for
three
pence
*NL*
a
day
.
The
fair
,
or
mart
,
we
found
,
had
been
over
for
some
time
;
*NL*
however
,
there
remained
in
the
river
four
junks
and
two
Japan
ships
,
the
*NL*
merchants
of
the
latter
being
on
shore
.
In
the
first
place
,
our
old
*NL*
pilot
brought
us
acquainted
with
the
missionary
Roman
priests
,
who
were
*NL*
converting
the
people
to
Christianity
:
two
of
them
were
reserved
,
rigid
,
*NL*
and
austere
,
applying
themselves
to
the
work
they
came
about
with
great
*NL*
earnestness
,
but
the
third
,
who
was
a
Frenchman
,
called
Father
Simon
,
*NL*
was
of
a
freer
conversation
,
not
seemingly
so
serious
and
grave
,
yet
no
*NL*
worse
Christian
than
the
other
two
,
one
of
whom
was
a
Portuguese
,
and
*NL*
the
other
a
Genoese
.
Father
Simon
,
it
seems
,
was
appointed
to
go
to
*NL*
Pekin
,
the
royal
seat
of
the
Emperor
of
the
Chinese
;
and
he
only
waited
*NL*
for
another
priest
,
who
was
ordered
from
Macao
to
accompany
him
.
We
*NL*
never
met
together
,
but
he
was
prompting
me
to
accompany
him
in
that
*NL*
journey
:
_
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
I
will
show
you
the
glorious
things
of
this
*NL*
mighty
empire
,
and
a
city
,
the
city
of
Pekin
,
far
exceeding
London
and
*NL*
Paris
,
put
them
both
together
_
.
One
day
in
particular
,
being
at
dinner
*NL*
with
him
,
I
showed
some
inclination
to
go
;
which
made
him
press
the
more
*NL*
upon
me
and
my
partner
,
to
gain
our
perfect
consent
.
_
But
,
Father
*NL*
Simon
_
,
said
my
partner
,
_
what
satisfaction
can
you
have
in
our
company
,
*NL*
whom
you
esteem
as
heretics
,
and
consequently
objects
not
worthy
your
*NL*
regard
?
O
_
,
said
he
,
_
you
may
be
as
good
Catholics
in
time
as
those
I
*NL*
hope
to
convert
to
our
religion
.
And
so
_
,
said
I
,
_
we
shall
have
you
*NL*
preaching
to
us
all
the
way
,
instead
of
pleasing
us
with
a
description
*NL*
of
the
country
.
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
however
our
religion
may
be
villified
by
*NL*
some
people
,
it
is
very
certain
it
neither
divests
us
of
good
manners
or
*NL*
Christian
charity
;
and
as
we
are
gentlemen
,
as
such
we
may
converse
*NL*
together
,
without
making
one
another
uneasy
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
shall
leave
him
a
while
,
to
consider
our
ship
and
the
merchandise
*NL*
which
we
had
to
dispose
of
.
There
was
but
very
little
trade
in
the
place
*NL*
where
we
were
;
and
I
was
once
resolved
to
venture
to
sail
to
the
river
*NL*
Kilam
,
and
so
to
the
city
of
Nanquin
;
but
Providence
ordered
it
*NL*
otherwise
,
by
our
old
pilot
's
bringing
a
Japan
merchant
to
us
,
to
see
*NL*
what
goods
we
had
.
He
immediately
bought
our
opium
,
for
which
he
gave
us
*NL*
a
very
good
price
in
gold
by
weight
,
some
wedges
of
which
were
about
ten
*NL*
or
eleven
ounces
.
It
came
into
my
head
that
perhaps
he
might
buy
the
*NL*
ship
too
;
and
I
ordered
the
interpreter
to
propose
it
to
him
.
He
said
*NL*
nothing
then
,
but
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
;
yet
in
a
few
days
after
he
*NL*
came
accompanied
by
a
missionary
priest
,
who
was
his
interpreter
,
with
*NL*
this
proposal
,
_
That
as
he
had
bought
a
great
quantity
of
our
goods
,
he
*NL*
had
not
money
enough
to
purchase
our
ship
;
but
if
I
pleased
he
would
*NL*
hire
her
,
with
all
my
men
,
to
go
to
Japan
,
and
from
thence
with
another
*NL*
loading
to
the
Philippine
islands
,
the
freight
of
both
which
he
would
*NL*
very
willingly
pay
to
us
before
;
and
at
their
return
to
Japan
,
would
buy
*NL*
the
ship
_
.
Upon
this
we
asked
the
Captain
and
his
men
if
they
were
*NL*
willing
to
go
to
Japan
;
to
which
they
unanimously
agreed
.
While
this
was
*NL*
in
agitation
,
the
young
man
my
nephew
left
to
attend
me
,
told
me
,
``
That
*NL*
as
I
did
not
care
to
accept
his
prospect
of
advantage
he
would
manage
it
*NL*
for
me
as
I
pleased
,
and
render
me
a
faithful
account
of
his
success
,
*NL*
which
would
be
wholly
mine
.
''
Indeed
I
was
very
unwilling
to
part
with
*NL*
him
;
but
considering
it
might
be
for
the
young
man
's
good
,
I
discoursed
*NL*
with
my
partner
about
it
,
who
,
of
his
own
generosity
,
gave
him
his
share
*NL*
of
the
vessel
,
so
that
I
could
do
no
otherwise
than
give
him
mine
:
but
,
*NL*
however
,
we
let
him
have
but
the
proper
half
of
it
,
and
preserved
a
*NL*
power
,
that
when
we
met
in
England
,
if
he
had
obtained
success
,
he
*NL*
should
account
to
us
for
one
half
of
the
profit
of
the
ship
's
freight
*NL*
and
the
other
should
be
his
own
.
Thus
having
taken
a
writing
under
his
*NL*
hand
,
away
he
sailed
to
Japan
,
where
the
merchant
dealt
very
honestly
by
*NL*
him
,
got
him
a
licence
to
come
on
shore
,
sent
him
loaded
to
the
*NL*
Philippines
with
a
Japanese
supercargo
,
from
whence
he
came
back
again
*NL*
loaded
with
European
goods
,
cloves
,
and
other
spiceries
.
By
this
voyage
*NL*
he
cleared
a
considerable
sum
of
money
,
which
determined
him
not
to
sell
*NL*
his
ship
,
but
to
trade
on
his
own
account
;
so
he
returned
to
the
*NL*
Manillas
,
where
,
getting
acquaintance
,
he
made
his
ship
free
,
was
hired
*NL*
by
the
governor
privately
to
go
to
Acapulco
in
America
,
on
the
Mexican
*NL*
coast
,
with
a
licence
to
travel
to
the
great
city
of
Mexico
.
This
*NL*
traffic
turned
out
greatly
to
account
,
and
my
friend
finding
means
to
*NL*
get
to
Jamaica
,
returned
nine
years
after
exceedingly
rich
into
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
parting
with
the
ship
,
it
comes
in
course
to
consider
of
those
men
*NL*
who
had
saved
our
lives
when
in
the
river
of
Cambodia
;
and
though
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
they
were
a
couple
of
rogues
,
who
thought
to
turn
pirates
*NL*
themselves
,
yet
we
paid
them
what
they
had
before
demanded
,
and
gave
*NL*
each
of
them
a
small
sum
of
money
,
making
the
Englishman
a
gunner
,
and
*NL*
the
Dutchman
a
boatswain
,
with
which
they
were
very
well
contented
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
now
about
1000
leagues
farther
from
home
,
than
when
at
Bengal
.
*NL*
All
the
comfort
we
could
expect
was
,
that
there
being
another
fair
to
be
*NL*
kept
in
a
month
's
time
,
we
might
not
only
purchase
all
sorts
of
that
*NL*
country
's
manufactures
,
but
very
possibly
find
some
Chinese
junks
,
or
*NL*
vessels
from
Tonquin
,
to
be
sold
,
which
would
carry
us
and
our
goods
*NL*
wheresoever
we
pleased
.
Upon
these
hopes
,
we
resolved
to
continue
;
and
,
*NL*
to
divert
ourselves
,
we
took
several
little
journies
in
the
country
.
*NL*
About
ten
days
after
we
parted
with
the
ship
,
we
travelled
to
see
the
*NL*
city
of
Nanquin
.
The
city
lies
in
latitude
30
degrees
north
of
the
line
:
*NL*
it
is
regularly
built
,
and
the
streets
are
exactly
straight
,
and
cross
*NL*
one
another
in
direct
lines
,
which
sets
it
out
to
the
greatest
*NL*
advantage
.
At
our
return
,
we
found
the
priest
was
come
from
Macao
,
that
*NL*
was
to
accompany
Father
Simon
to
Pekin
.
That
Father
earnestly
solicited
*NL*
me
to
accompany
him
,
&
I
referred
him
to
my
partner
.
In
short
,
we
both
*NL*
agreed
,
and
prepared
accordingly
;
and
we
were
so
lucky
as
to
have
*NL*
liberty
to
travel
among
the
retinue
of
one
of
their
Mandarines
,
who
is
a
*NL*
principal
magistrate
,
and
much
reverenced
by
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
five
and
twenty
days
travelling
thro
'
this
miserable
country
,
*NL*
infinitely
populous
,
but
as
indifferently
cultivated
;
and
yet
their
*NL*
pride
is
infinitely
greater
than
their
poverty
,
insomuch
that
they
*NL*
priests
themselves
derided
them
.
As
we
passed
by
the
house
of
one
of
*NL*
their
country
gentlemen
,
two
leagues
off
Nanquin
,
we
had
the
honour
,
*NL*
forsooth
,
to
ride
with
the
Chinese
squire
about
two
miles
.
Never
was
Don
*NL*
Quixote
so
exactly
imitated
!
Never
such
a
compound
of
pomp
and
poverty
*NL*
seen
before
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
habit
,
made
of
calico
,
was
dirty
,
greasy
,
and
very
proper
for
a
*NL*
Mersy
Andrew
or
Scaramouch
,
with
all
its
tawdry
trappings
,
as
hanging
*NL*
sleeves
,
tassels
,
&
c.
though
torn
and
rent
in
almost
every
part
;
his
*NL*
vest
underneath
it
was
no
less
dirty
,
but
more
greatly
;
resembling
the
*NL*
most
exquisite
sloven
or
greasy
butcher
;
his
horse
-LRB-
worse
than
*NL*
Rosinante
,
or
the
famous
steed
of
doughty
Hudibras
-RRB-
was
a
poor
starved
*NL*
decrepid
thing
,
that
would
not
sell
for
thirty
shillings
in
England
;
*NL*
and
yet
this
piece
of
worshipful
pomp
was
attended
with
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
slaves
who
guarded
their
master
to
his
country
seat
.
We
stopped
at
a
*NL*
little
village
for
refreshment
;
and
when
we
came
by
the
country
seat
of
*NL*
this
great
man
,
we
found
him
sitting
under
a
tree
before
his
door
,
*NL*
eating
a
mess
of
boiled
rice
,
with
a
great
piece
of
garlic
in
the
*NL*
middle
,
and
a
bag
filled
with
green
pepper
by
him
,
and
another
plant
*NL*
like
ginger
,
together
with
a
piece
of
lean
mutton
in
it
:
this
was
his
*NL*
worship
's
repast
:
but
pray
observe
the
state
of
the
food
!
two
women
*NL*
slaves
brought
him
his
food
,
which
being
laid
before
him
,
two
others
*NL*
appeared
to
perform
their
respective
offices
;
one
fed
him
with
a
spoon
,
*NL*
while
the
other
scraped
off
what
fell
upon
his
beard
and
taffety
vest
,
*NL*
and
gave
it
to
a
particular
favourite
to
eat
.
And
thus
we
left
the
*NL*
wretch
pleased
with
the
conceit
of
our
admiring
his
magnificence
,
which
*NL*
rather
merited
our
scorn
and
detestation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
arrived
at
the
great
city
of
Pekin
,
accompanied
by
two
*NL*
servants
,
and
the
old
Portuguese
pilot
,
whose
charges
we
bore
,
and
who
*NL*
served
us
as
an
interpreter
by
the
way
.
We
had
scarce
been
a
week
at
*NL*
Pekin
,
but
he
comes
laughing
to
us
.
``
Ah
!
Seignior
Inglise
,
-LRB-
said
he
-RRB-
me
*NL*
something
tell
you
make
your
heart
glad
,
but
make
me
sorry
:
for
your
*NL*
bring
me
here
twenty-five
days
journey
,
and
now
you
leave
me
go
back
*NL*
alone
;
and
which
way
shall
I
make
my
port
after
,
without
de
ship
,
*NL*
without
de
horse
,
without
pecune
?
''
so
he
called
money
in
his
broken
*NL*
Latin
.
He
then
informed
me
,
that
there
was
a
great
caravan
of
Muscovite
*NL*
and
Polish
merchants
in
the
city
,
who
were
preparing
to
set
out
for
*NL*
Muscovy
by
land
within
six
weeks
;
and
,
that
he
was
certain
we
would
take
*NL*
this
opportunity
,
and
consequently
that
he
must
go
home
by
himself
.
*NL*
Indeed
this
news
infinitely
surprised
&
pleased
me
.
``
Are
you
certain
of
*NL*
this
?
''
said
I
,
``
Yes
,
Sir
,
-LRB-
says
he
-RRB-
me
sure
its
true
.
''
And
so
he
told
*NL*
me
,
that
having
met
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
,
an
Armenian
,
in
the
*NL*
street
,
who
was
among
them
,
and
who
had
come
from
Astracan
,
with
a
*NL*
design
to
go
to
Tonquin
,
but
for
certain
reasons
having
altered
his
*NL*
resolutions
,
he
was
now
resolved
to
go
with
the
caravan
,
and
to
return
*NL*
by
the
river
Wolga
to
Astracan
.
``
Well
,
Seignior
,
-LRB-
said
I
-RRB-
do
n't
be
*NL*
discontented
about
your
returning
alone
;
and
if
,
by
this
means
,
I
can
*NL*
find
a
passage
to
England
,
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
return
to
*NL*
Macao
at
all
.
''
And
so
consulting
with
my
partner
what
was
best
to
be
*NL*
done
,
he
referred
it
to
me
as
I
pleased
,
having
our
affairs
so
well
*NL*
settled
at
Bengal
,
that
if
he
could
convert
the
good
voyage
he
had
made
*NL*
in
China
silks
,
wrought
or
raw
,
he
would
be
satisfied
to
go
to
England
;
*NL*
and
so
return
to
Bengal
in
the
Company
's
ships
.
Thus
resolved
,
we
agreed
*NL*
that
if
our
pilot
would
go
with
us
,
we
would
bear
his
charges
either
to
*NL*
Moscow
or
England
;
and
to
give
him
in
a
present
the
sum
of
one
hundred
*NL*
and
seventy
pounds
sterling
.
Hereupon
we
called
him
in
,
and
told
him
the
*NL*
cause
of
his
complaint
should
be
removed
,
if
he
would
accompany
us
with
*NL*
the
caravans
;
and
,
therefore
,
we
desired
to
know
his
mind
.
At
this
he
*NL*
shook
his
head
,
``
Great
long
journey
,
-LRB-
said
he
-RRB-
me
no
pecune
carry
me
to
*NL*
Moscow
,
or
keep
me
there
.
''
But
we
soon
put
him
out
of
that
concern
,
by
*NL*
making
him
sensible
of
what
we
would
give
him
here
to
lay
out
the
best
*NL*
advantage
;
and
,
as
for
his
charges
,
we
would
set
him
safe
on
shore
,
God
*NL*
willing
,
either
in
Muscovy
or
England
,
as
he
pleased
,
at
our
own
charge
,
*NL*
except
the
carriage
of
his
goods
.
At
this
proposal
,
he
was
like
a
man
*NL*
transported
,
telling
us
he
would
go
with
us
all
the
world
over
;
and
we
*NL*
made
preparations
for
our
journey
;
but
it
was
near
four
months
before
*NL*
all
the
merchants
were
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mean
time
,
my
partner
and
the
pilot
went
express
to
the
port
*NL*
where
we
first
put
in
,
to
dispose
of
what
goods
had
been
left
there
,
*NL*
while
I
accompanied
a
Chinese
merchant
who
was
going
to
Nanquin
,
and
*NL*
there
bought
twenty-nine
pieces
of
damask
,
with
about
three
hundred
more
*NL*
of
other
fine
silks
;
and
,
by
the
time
my
partner
returned
to
Pekin
,
I
*NL*
had
them
all
carried
thither
;
our
cargo
in
silks
amounted
to
45col
.
*NL*
sterling
,
which
,
together
with
tea
,
fine
calicoes
,
nutmegs
,
and
cloves
,
*NL*
loaded
eighteen
camels
for
our
share
,
besides
what
we
rode
upon
,
with
*NL*
two
or
three
spare
horses
,
and
two
more
loaden
with
provisions
;
the
*NL*
company
now
was
very
great
,
making
about
four
hundred
horse
,
and
above
*NL*
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
,
well
armed
and
provided
.
We
were
of
several
*NL*
nations
,
among
whom
were
five
Scotch
merchants
,
inhabiting
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
and
well
experienced
in
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
set
out
from
Pekin
the
beginning
of
February
our
stile
;
and
in
two
*NL*
days
more
,
we
passed
through
the
gate
of
the
great
China
wall
,
which
was
*NL*
erected
as
a
fortification
against
the
Tartars
,
being
one
hundred
*NL*
English
miles
long
.
We
then
entered
a
country
not
near
so
populous
,
*NL*
chiefly
under
the
power
of
plundering
Tartars
,
several
companies
of
whom
*NL*
we
perceived
riding
on
poor
starved
horses
,
contemptible
as
themselves
*NL*
without
order
of
discipline
.
One
time
our
leader
,
for
the
day
,
gave
us
*NL*
leave
to
go
a
hunting
;
but
what
do
you
think
we
hunted
?
only
a
parcel
of
*NL*
sheep
,
which
indeed
exceeded
any
in
the
world
for
wildness
and
*NL*
swiftness
;
but
while
we
were
pursuing
this
game
,
it
was
our
chance
to
*NL*
meet
with
about
forty
Tartars
,
who
no
sooner
perceived
us
,
but
one
of
*NL*
them
blew
a
horn
,
at
the
sound
of
which
there
soon
appeared
a
troop
of
*NL*
forty
or
fifty
more
,
at
about
a
mile
's
distance
.
Hereupon
,
one
of
the
*NL*
Scots
merchants
-LRB-
who
knew
their
ways
-RRB-
ordered
us
to
advance
towards
*NL*
them
,
and
attack
them
immediately
,
As
we
advanced
,
they
let
fly
a
*NL*
volley
of
arrows
,
which
happily
fell
a
little
short
of
us
;
this
made
us
*NL*
halt
a
little
,
to
return
the
compliment
with
bullets
;
and
then
being
led
*NL*
up
by
the
bold
Scot
,
we
fired
our
pistols
in
their
faces
,
and
drew
out
*NL*
our
swords
;
but
there
was
no
occasion
;
for
they
flew
like
timorous
*NL*
sheep
,
&
only
three
of
them
remained
,
beckoning
to
the
rest
to
come
*NL*
back
.
But
our
brave
commander
gallops
up
to
them
by
himself
,
shot
one
*NL*
dead
,
knocked
another
of
his
horse
,
while
the
third
ran
away
;
and
thus
*NL*
ended
our
battle
with
the
Tartars
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
travelled
a
month
more
through
the
Emperor
of
China
's
dominions
;
and
*NL*
at
length
coming
to
one
of
their
towns
about
a
day
and
a
half
's
journey
*NL*
from
the
city
of
Naum
,
I
wanted
to
buy
a
camel
.
The
person
I
spoke
to
*NL*
would
have
brought
me
one
,
but
,
like
a
fool
,
I
must
go
along
with
him
,
*NL*
about
two
miles
from
the
village
.
My
old
pilot
and
I
walked
on
foot
,
*NL*
forsooth
,
for
some
variety
,
when
coming
to
the
place
where
the
camels
*NL*
were
kept
as
in
a
park
guarded
by
Chinese
soldiers
,
we
there
agreed
and
*NL*
bought
one
,
which
the
Chinese
man
that
came
along
with
me
led
along
the
*NL*
road
.
But
we
had
not
gone
far
,
before
we
were
attacked
by
five
Tartars
,
*NL*
mounted
on
horseback
,
two
of
whom
seized
the
man
,
took
the
camel
from
*NL*
him
,
and
rode
away
,
while
the
other
three
approached
us
,
the
first
of
*NL*
whom
suddenly
seized
me
as
I
was
drawing
my
sword
,
the
second
;
knocked
*NL*
me
down
,
but
my
old
trusty
Portuguese
taking
a
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
,
*NL*
which
I
knew
nothing
of
,
and
coming
up
to
the
fellow
that
struck
me
,
he
*NL*
with
one
hand
pulled
him
off
his
horse
,
and
then
shot
him
dead
upon
the
*NL*
spot
;
then
taking
his
scymitar
,
he
struck
at
the
man
that
stopped
us
,
*NL*
but
missing
him
,
cut
off
one
of
his
horses
ears
,
the
pain
of
which
made
*NL*
him
throw
his
rider
to
the
ground
.
The
poor
Chinese
who
had
led
the
*NL*
camel
,
seeing
the
Tartar
down
,
runs
to
him
,
and
seizing
upon
his
*NL*
pole-ax
,
wrenched
it
from
his
hands
,
and
knocked
his
brains
out
.
But
*NL*
there
was
another
Tartar
to
deal
with
,
who
seeming
neither
inclined
to
*NL*
fight
nor
fly
,
and
my
old
man
having
begun
to
charge
his
pistol
,
the
*NL*
very
sight
of
it
struck
such
a
terror
into
the
wretch
,
that
away
he
*NL*
scoured
,
leaving
my
old
pilot
,
rather
my
champion
and
defender
,
an
*NL*
absolute
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
being
awakened
from
my
trance
,
I
began
to
open
my
eyes
,
*NL*
wondering
where
I
was
,
having
quite
forgot
all
that
passed
;
but
my
*NL*
senses
returning
,
and
feeling
a
great
pain
in
my
head
,
and
seeing
the
*NL*
blood
was
running
over
my
clothes
,
I
instantly
jumped
upon
my
feet
,
and
*NL*
grasped
my
sword
in
my
hand
,
with
a
resolution
to
take
revenge
:
but
no
*NL*
enemies
now
remained
,
except
the
dead
Tartar
,
with
his
horse
standing
by
*NL*
him
.
The
old
man
seeing
me
recovered
,
whom
he
thought
slain
,
ran
towards
*NL*
me
,
and
embraced
me
with
the
greatest
tenderness
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
examining
into
my
wound
,
which
was
far
from
being
mortal
.
When
we
*NL*
returned
to
the
village
,
the
man
demanded
payment
for
his
camel
,
which
I
*NL*
refusing
,
we
brought
the
cause
,
before
a
Chinese
judge
,
who
acted
with
*NL*
great
impartiality
:
Having
heard
both
sides
,
he
asked
the
Chinese
man
*NL*
that
went
with
me
,
whose
servant
he
was
?
_
Sir
,
_
said
he
,
_
I
am
nobody
's
,
*NL*
but
went
with
the
stranger
at
his
request
:
Why
then
_
,
said
the
judge
,
*NL*
_
you
are
the
stranger
's
servant
for
the
time
,
and
the
camel
being
*NL*
delivered
to
his
servant
,
it
is
the
same
as
though
delivered
to
himself
,
*NL*
and
accordingly
he
must
pay
for
it
.
_
Indeed
the
case
was
so
fairly
*NL*
stated
,
that
I
had
nothing
to
object
to
it
;
so
,
having
paid
for
that
I
*NL*
was
robbed
of
,
I
sent
for
another
,
but
did
not
go
myself
to
fetch
it
,
as
*NL*
I
had
enough
of
that
sport
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
city
of
Naum
is
a
frontier
of
the
Chinese
empire
,
so
fortified
,
as
*NL*
some
will
tell
you
,
that
millions
of
Tartars
can
not
batter
down
their
*NL*
walls
;
by
which
certainly
one
might
think
one
of
our
cannons
would
do
*NL*
more
execution
than
all
their
legions
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
within
a
day
's
march
of
that
city
,
we
had
information
that
*NL*
the
governor
had
sent
messengers
to
every
part
of
the
road
,
to
inform
*NL*
the
travellers
and
caravans
to
halt
,
till
a
guard
was
sent
to
protect
*NL*
them
from
the
numerous
bodies
of
Tartars
that
lately
appeared
about
the
*NL*
city
.
This
news
put
us
into
great
consternation
;
but
,
obeying
the
*NL*
orders
,
we
stopt
;
&
two
days
after
,
there
came
two
hundred
soldiers
from
*NL*
a
garrison
of
the
Chinese
,
and
three
hundred
more
from
Naum
;
thus
*NL*
guarded
both
in
the
front
and
rear
,
with
our
own
men
in
the
flanks
,
we
*NL*
boldly
advanced
,
thinking
we
were
able
to
combat
with
ten
thousand
Mogul
*NL*
Tartars
,
if
they
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
next
morning
,
in
our
march
from
a
little
well
situated
town
called
*NL*
Changu
,
after
having
passed
a
river
,
and
entered
upon
a
desert
of
about
*NL*
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
over
,
we
soon
beheld
by
a
cloud
of
dust
that
*NL*
was
raised
,
that
the
enemy
was
approaching
.
This
much
dispirited
the
*NL*
Chinese
.
My
old
pilot
took
notice
of
it
,
and
called
out
,
_
Seignor
*NL*
Inglise
,
those
fellows
must
be
encouraged
,
or
they
will
ruin
us
all
,
and
*NL*
I
am
afraid
if
the
Tartars
attack
us
,
they
will
all
run
away
_
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
Seignor
,
-LRB-
said
I
-RRB-
,
what
shall
be
done
in
this
case
?
''
_
Done
_
,
says
he
,
*NL*
_
why
let
fifty
of
our
men
advance
,
and
flank
them
on
each
wing
.
I
know
*NL*
the
fellows
will
fight
well
enough
in
company
_
.
We
accordingly
took
his
*NL*
advice
,
and
marched
fifty
to
the
right
wing
,
and
the
same
number
to
the
*NL*
left
,
and
with
the
rest
made
a
line
of
reserve
,
leaving
the
last
two
*NL*
hundred
men
to
guard
the
camels
,
or
to
assist
us
,
as
occasion
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
prepared
,
a
party
of
the
enemy
came
forward
,
viewing
our
posture
,
*NL*
and
traversing
the
ground
on
the
front
of
our
line
.
Hereupon
we
ordered
*NL*
the
two
wings
to
move
on
,
and
give
them
a
salute
with
their
shot
;
which
*NL*
accordingly
was
done
.
This
put
a
stop
to
their
proceedings
;
for
*NL*
immediately
wheeling
off
to
their
left
,
they
all
marched
away
,
and
we
*NL*
saw
no
more
of
them
.
They
had
undoubtedly
given
an
account
to
their
*NL*
companions
of
what
reception
they
might
expect
,
which
made
them
to
*NL*
easily
give
over
their
enterprize
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
city
of
Naum
,
we
returned
the
governor
hearty
*NL*
thanks
,
and
distributed
a
hundred
crowns
among
the
soldiers
that
guarded
*NL*
us
.
We
rested
there
one
day
,
and
then
proceeded
on
our
travels
,
passing
*NL*
several
great
rivers
and
deserts
and
on
the
13th
of
April
we
came
to
the
*NL*
frontiers
of
Muscovy
,
the
first
town
of
which
was
called
Argun
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
happy
occasion
,
as
I
thought
,
of
coming
into
a
Christian
country
,
*NL*
made
me
congratulate
the
Scots
merchant
upon
it
.
He
smiled
at
that
,
*NL*
telling
me
not
to
rejoice
too
soon
;
_
for
_
,
said
he
,
_
except
the
Russian
*NL*
soldiers
in
garrison
,
and
a
few
inhabitants
of
the
cities
upon
the
road
,
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
this
country
,
for
above
a
thousand
miles
,
is
inhabited
*NL*
by
the
most
ignorant
and
barbarous
Pagans
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
advanced
from
the
river
Arguna
,
by
moderate
journies
and
found
*NL*
convenient
garrisons
on
the
road
,
filled
with
Christian
soldiers
for
the
*NL*
security
of
commerce
,
and
for
the
convenient
lodgings
of
travellers
:
but
*NL*
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
were
mere
Pagans
,
worshiping
the
sun
,
*NL*
moon
,
and
stars
.
We
particularly
observed
this
idolatry
near
the
river
*NL*
Arguna
,
at
a
city
inhabited
by
Tartars
and
Russians
,
called
Nerisinkey
.
*NL*
Being
curious
to
see
their
way
of
living
,
while
the
caravan
continued
to
*NL*
rest
themselves
in
that
city
,
I
went
to
one
of
their
villages
,
where
*NL*
there
was
to
be
one
of
their
solemn
sacrifices
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
I
beheld
upon
the
stump
of
an
old
tree
,
an
idol
of
wood
,
more
ugly
*NL*
than
the
representation
of
the
devil
himself
:
its
head
resembled
no
*NL*
living
creature
;
its
ears
were
as
big
and
as
high
as
goat
's
horns
,
a
*NL*
crooked
nose
,
four-cornered
mouth
,
and
horrible
teeth
:
it
was
clothed
in
*NL*
sheep
skins
,
had
a
great
Tartar
bonnet
,
with
two
horns
growing
thro
'
it
,
*NL*
and
was
eight
feet
high
,
without
feet
,
legs
or
proportion
.
Before
this
*NL*
idol
their
lay
sixteen
or
seventeen
people
,
who
brought
their
offerings
,
*NL*
and
were
making
their
prayers
,
while
at
a
distance
stood
three
men
and
*NL*
one
bullock
,
as
victims
to
this
ugly
monster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
stupendous
sacrilege
as
this
,
in
robbing
the
true
God
of
his
*NL*
honour
,
filled
me
with
the
greatest
astonishment
and
reflection
:
which
*NL*
soon
turning
to
rage
and
fury
,
I
rode
up
to
the
image
,
and
cut
in
pieces
*NL*
the
bonnet
that
was
upon
his
head
with
my
sword
,
so
that
it
hung
down
by
*NL*
one
of
the
horns
,
while
one
of
my
men
that
was
with
me
pulled
at
it
by
*NL*
his
sheep-skin
garment
.
Immediately
an
hideous
howling
and
outcry
ran
*NL*
through
the
village
,
and
two
or
three
hundred
people
coming
about
our
*NL*
ears
,
we
were
obliged
to
fly
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
not
done
with
the
monster
;
for
the
caravan
being
to
rest
*NL*
three
nights
in
the
town
,
I
told
the
Scots
merchant
what
I
had
seen
,
and
*NL*
that
I
was
resolved
to
take
four
or
five
men
well
armed
with
me
,
in
*NL*
order
to
destroy
the
idol
,
and
show
the
people
how
little
reason
they
*NL*
had
to
trust
in
a
god
who
could
not
save
himself
.
At
first
he
laughed
at
*NL*
me
,
representing
the
danger
of
it
,
and
when
it
was
destroyed
,
what
time
*NL*
had
we
to
preach
to
them
better
things
,
whole
zeal
and
ignorance
was
in
*NL*
the
highest
degree
,
and
both
unparalleled
?
that
if
I
should
be
taken
by
*NL*
them
,
I
should
be
served
as
a
poor
ruffian
,
who
contemned
their
worship
;
*NL*
that
is
,
to
be
stripped
naked
,
and
tied
to
the
top
of
the
idol
,
there
*NL*
shot
at
with
arrows
till
my
body
was
fall
of
them
,
and
then
burnt
as
a
*NL*
sacrifice
to
the
monster
;
_
but
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
_
since
your
zeal
carries
*NL*
you
so
far
,
rather
than
you
should
be
alone
I
will
accompany
you
,
and
*NL*
bring
a
stout
fellow
equal
to
yourself
,
if
you
will
,
to
assist
you
in
*NL*
this
design
:
_
and
accordingly
he
brought
one
Captain
Richardson
,
who
,
*NL*
hearing
the
story
,
readily
consented
;
but
my
partner
declined
it
,
being
*NL*
altogether
out
of
his
way
:
and
so
we
three
,
and
my
servant
,
resolved
to
*NL*
execute
this
exploit
about
midnight
;
but
upon
second
thoughts
we
*NL*
deferred
it
to
the
next
night
,
by
reason
that
the
caravan
being
to
go
*NL*
from
hence
the
next
morning
,
we
should
be
out
of
the
governor
's
power
.
*NL*
The
better
to
effectuate
my
design
,
I
procured
a
Tartar
's
sheep-skin
*NL*
robe
,
a
bonnet
,
with
bow
and
arrows
,
and
every
one
of
us
got
the
like
*NL*
habits
,
the
first
night
we
spent
in
mixing
combustible
matter
with
aqua
*NL*
vitae
,
gunpowder
,
&
c.
having
a
good
quantity
of
tar
in
a
little
pot
:
*NL*
next
night
we
came
up
to
the
idol
about
eleven
o'clock
,
the
moon
being
*NL*
up
.
We
found
none
guarding
it
;
but
we
perceived
a
light
in
the
house
,
*NL*
where
we
had
seen
the
priests
before
.
One
of
our
men
was
for
firing
the
*NL*
hut
,
another
for
killing
the
people
,
and
a
third
for
making
them
*NL*
prisoners
,
while
the
idol
was
destroyed
.
We
agreed
to
the
latter
;
so
*NL*
knocking
at
the
door
,
we
seized
the
first
that
opened
it
,
and
stopping
*NL*
his
mouth
and
tying
his
feet
,
we
left
him
.
We
served
the
other
two
in
*NL*
the
like
manner
;
and
then
the
Scots
merchant
set
fire
to
the
*NL*
composition
,
which
frightened
them
so
much
,
that
we
brought
them
all
*NL*
away
prisoners
to
their
wooden
god
.
There
we
fell
to
work
with
him
,
*NL*
daubing
him
all
over
with
tar
mixed
with
tallow
and
brimstone
stopping
*NL*
his
eyes
,
ears
,
and
mouth
full
of
gunpowder
,
with
a
great
piece
of
*NL*
wild-fire
in
his
bonnet
,
and
environed
it
with
dry
forage
.
All
this
*NL*
being
done
,
we
unloosed
and
ungagged
the
prisoners
,
and
set
the
idol
on
*NL*
fire
,
which
the
gunpowder
blowing
up
,
the
shape
of
it
was
deformed
,
rent
*NL*
and
split
,
which
the
forage
utterly
consumed
;
for
we
staid
to
see
its
*NL*
destruction
,
lest
the
ignorant
idolatrous
people
should
have
thrown
*NL*
themselves
into
the
flames
,
And
thus
we
came
away
undiscovered
,
in
the
*NL*
morning
appearing
as
busy
among
our
fellow
travellers
,
as
no
body
could
*NL*
have
suspected
any
other
,
but
that
we
had
been
in
our
beds
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
we
let
out
,
and
had
gone
but
a
small
distance
from
the
*NL*
city
,
when
there
came
a
multitude
of
people
of
the
country
to
the
gates
*NL*
of
the
city
,
demanding
satisfaction
of
the
Ruffian
governor
for
*NL*
insulting
their
priests
,
and
burning
their
great
Cham
Cai-Thaungu
,
who
*NL*
dwelt
in
the
sun
,
and
no
mortal
would
violate
this
image
but
some
*NL*
Christian
miscreants
;
and
being
already
no
less
than
thirty
thousand
*NL*
strong
,
they
announced
war
against
him
and
all
his
Christians
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
assured
them
he
was
ignorant
of
the
matter
,
and
that
none
*NL*
of
his
garrison
had
been
abroad
;
that
indeed
there
was
a
caravan
that
*NL*
went
away
that
morning
,
and
that
he
would
send
after
them
to
inquire
*NL*
into
it
;
and
whoever
was
the
offender
,
should
be
delivered
into
their
*NL*
hands
.
This
satisfied
them
for
the
present
,
but
the
governor
sent
to
*NL*
inform
us
,
that
if
any
of
us
had
done
it
,
we
should
make
all
the
haste
*NL*
away
possible
,
while
he
kept
them
in
play
as
long
as
he
could
.
Upon
this
*NL*
we
marched
two
days
and
two
nights
,
stopping
but
very
little
,
till
at
*NL*
last
we
arrived
at
a
village
called
Plothus
,
and
hasted
to
Jerawena
,
*NL*
another
of
the
Czar
's
colonies
.
On
the
third
day
,
having
entered
the
*NL*
desert
,
and
passed
the
lake
called
Shaks
Oser
,
we
beheld
a
numerous
body
*NL*
of
horde
on
the
other
side
or
it
to
the
north
,
who
supposed
we
had
*NL*
passed
on
that
side
of
the
lake
;
but
either
having
found
the
mistake
,
or
*NL*
being
certainly
informed
of
the
way
we
took
,
they
came
upon
us
towards
*NL*
the
dusk
of
the
evening
,
just
as
we
had
pitched
our
camp
between
two
*NL*
little
but
very
thick
woods
,
with
a
little
river
running
before
our
*NL*
front
and
some
felled
trees
with
which
we
covered
our
rear
;
a
precaution
*NL*
we
always
took
,
and
which
we
had
just
finished
when
the
enemy
came
up
.
*NL*
They
did
not
fall
on
us
immediately
,
but
sent
three
messengers
,
*NL*
demanding
the
men
who
had
insulted
their
priests
,
&
burnt
their
god
,
*NL*
Cham
Chi-Thaungu
,
that
they
might
be
burnt
with
fire
;
that
if
this
was
*NL*
complied
with
,
they
would
peaceably
depart
;
but
if
not
,
they
would
*NL*
destroy
one
and
all
of
us
.
Our
men
stared
at
one
another
on
receipt
of
*NL*
this
message
,
but
Nobody
was
the
word
,
as
indeed
nobody
knew
it
,
but
he
*NL*
who
did
it
.
Upon
which
the
leader
of
the
caravan
returned
for
answer
,
*NL*
_
That
they
were
peaceable
merchants
,
who
meddled
with
none
of
their
*NL*
priests
and
gods
and
therefore
desired
,
them
not
to
disturb
us
,
and
put
*NL*
us
to
the
necessity
of
defending
ourselves
_
.
But
do
far
was
this
from
*NL*
satisfying
them
,
that
the
next
morning
coming
to
our
right
,
they
let
fly
*NL*
a
volley
of
arrows
among
us
,
which
happily
did
not
hurt
any
,
because
we
*NL*
sheltered
ourselves
behind
our
baggage
.
We
expected
however
to
come
to
a
*NL*
closer
engagement
;
but
were
happily
saved
by
a
cunning
fellow
,
a
*NL*
Cossack
,
who
obtaining
leave
of
the
leader
to
go
out
,
mounts
his
horse
,
*NL*
rides
directly
from
our
rear
,
and
taking
a
circuit
,
comes
up
to
the
*NL*
Tartars
,
as
tho
he
had
been
sent
express
,
and
tells
them
a
formal
story
,
*NL*
that
the
wretches
who
had
burnt
the
Cham
Chi-Thaungu
,
were
gone
to
*NL*
Shiheilka
,
with
a
resolution
to
burn
the
god
Shal-Ifar
,
belonging
to
the
*NL*
Tongueses
.
Upon
which
,
believing
this
cunning
Tartar
,
who
was
servant
to
*NL*
our
Muscovites
,
away
they
drove
to
Shiheilka
,
and
in
less
than
three
*NL*
minutes
were
out
of
sight
,
nor
did
we
ever
hear
of
them
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
city
of
Jarawena
,
we
rested
five
days
,
and
then
*NL*
entered
into
a
frightful
desert
,
which
held
us
twenty-three
days
march
,
*NL*
infested
with
several
small
companies
of
robbers
,
or
Mogul
Tartars
,
who
*NL*
never
had
the
courage
to
attack
us
.
After
we
had
passed
over
this
*NL*
desert
,
we
found
several
garisons
to
defend
the
caravans
from
the
*NL*
violence
of
the
Tartars
.
In
particular
the
Governor
of
Adinskoy
offered
*NL*
us
a
guard
of
fifty
men
to
the
next
station
,
if
we
apprehended
any
*NL*
danger
.
The
people
here
retained
the
same
paganism
and
barbarity
,
only
*NL*
they
were
not
so
dangerous
,
being
conquered
by
the
Muscovites
.
The
*NL*
clothing
,
both
of
men
&
women
,
is
of
the
skins
of
beasts
,
living
under
*NL*
the
ground
in
vaults
&
caves
,
which
have
a
communication
with
one
*NL*
another
.
They
have
idols
almost
in
every
family
;
besides
,
they
adore
the
*NL*
sun
and
stars
,
water
and
snow
;
and
the
least
uncommon
thing
that
happens
*NL*
in
the
elements
,
alarms
them
as
much
as
thunder
and
lightning
does
the
*NL*
unbelieving
Jews
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
remarkable
occurred
in
our
march
through
this
country
.
When
we
*NL*
had
gone
through
the
desert
,
after
two
days
farther
travel
;
we
came
to
*NL*
Jenezoy
,
a
Muscovite
city
,
on
the
great
river
so
called
,
which
we
were
*NL*
told
,
parted
Europe
from
Asia
.
The
inhabitants
here
were
very
little
*NL*
better
,
though
intermixed
with
the
Muscovites
,
but
the
wonder
will
*NL*
cease
,
when
I
inform
my
readers
of
what
was
observed
to
me
,
that
the
*NL*
Czar
rather
converts
the
Tartars
with
soldiers
than
clergymen
,
and
is
*NL*
more
proud
to
make
them
faithful
subjects
,
than
good
Christians
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
city
to
the
river
Oby
,
we
travelled
over
a
pleasant
,
fruitful
,
*NL*
but
very
uncultivated
country
,
for
want
of
good
management
and
people
,
*NL*
and
those
few
are
mostly
Pagans
.
This
is
the
place
where
the
Muscovite
*NL*
criminals
are
banished
to
,
if
they
are
not
put
to
death
.
The
next
city
*NL*
we
came
to
,
was
the
capital
city
of
Siberia
,
called
Tobolski
when
having
*NL*
been
almost
seven
months
on
our
journey
,
and
winter
drawing
on
apace
,
my
*NL*
partner
and
I
consulted
about
our
particular
affairs
in
what
manner
we
*NL*
should
dispose
of
ourselves
.
We
had
been
told
of
sledges
and
rein-deer
*NL*
to
carry
us
over
the
snow
in
the
winter
season
,
the
snow
being
frozen
so
*NL*
hard
,
that
the
sledges
can
run
upon
the
surface
without
any
danger
of
*NL*
going
down
.
As
I
was
bound
to
England
,
I
now
behoved
either
to
go
with
*NL*
the
caravan
to
Jerosaw
,
from
thence
west
to
Marva
,
and
the
gulph
of
*NL*
Finland
,
and
so
by
land
or
sea
to
Denmark
;
or
else
I
must
leave
the
*NL*
caravan
at
a
little
town
on
the
Dwina
,
and
so
to
Archangel
,
where
I
was
*NL*
certain
of
shipping
either
to
England
,
Holland
,
or
Hamburgh
.
One
night
I
*NL*
happened
to
get
into
the
company
of
an
illustrious
,
but
banished
Prince
,
*NL*
whose
company
and
virtues
were
such
as
made
me
to
propose
to
him
a
*NL*
method
how
he
might
obtain
his
liberty
.
_
My
dear
friend
_
,
said
he
,
_
as
I
*NL*
am
here
happily
free
from
my
miserable
greatness
with
all
its
attendants
*NL*
of
pride
,
ambition
,
avarice
,
and
luxury
,
if
I
should
escape
from
this
*NL*
place
,
those
pernicious
seeds
may
again
revive
,
to
my
lasting
*NL*
disquietude
;
therefore
let
me
remain
in
a
blessed
confinement
,
for
I
am
*NL*
but
flesh
,
a
mere
man
,
with
passions
and
affections
as
such
;
O
be
not
my
*NL*
friend
and
tempter
too
!
_
Struck
dumb
with
surprise
,
I
stood
silent
*NL*
a-while
;
nor
was
he
less
in
disorder
,
by
which
perceiving
he
wanted
to
*NL*
give
vent
to
his
mind
,
I
desired
him
to
consider
of
it
,
and
so
withdrew
.
*NL*
But
about
two
hours
after
he
came
to
my
apartment
:
_
Dear
friend
_
,
said
*NL*
he
,
_
though
I
can
not
consent
to
accompany
you
,
I
shall
have
this
*NL*
satisfaction
in
parting
,
that
you
leave
me
an
honest
man
still
:
but
as
a
*NL*
testimony
of
my
affection
to
you
,
be
pleased
to
accept
this
present
*NL*
of
sables
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
return
for
his
compliment
,
I
sent
my
servant
next
morning
to
his
*NL*
Lordship
with
a
small
present
of
tea
,
two
pieces
of
China
damask
,
and
*NL*
four
little
wedges
of
gold
;
but
he
only
accepted
the
tea
,
one
piece
of
*NL*
damask
,
and
one
piece
of
gold
,
for
the
curiosity
of
the
Japan
stamp
that
*NL*
was
upon
it
.
Not
long
after
he
sent
for
me
,
and
told
me
,
_
that
what
he
*NL*
had
refused
himself
,
he
hoped
upon
his
account
,
I
would
grant
to
another
*NL*
whom
he
should
name
:
_
In
short
it
was
his
only
son
,
who
was
about
two
*NL*
hundred
miles
distant
from
him
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
,
whom
he
*NL*
said
he
would
send
for
,
if
I
gave
my
consent
.
This
I
soon
complied
with
;
*NL*
upon
which
he
sent
his
servants
next
day
for
his
son
,
who
returned
in
*NL*
twenty
days
time
,
bringing
seven
horses
loaded
with
valuable
furs
.
At
*NL*
night
the
young
Lord
was
conducted
incognito
into
our
apartment
,
where
*NL*
his
father
presented
him
to
me
.
We
then
concerted
the
best
ways
for
*NL*
travelling
,
and
after
having
bought
a
considerable
quantity
of
sables
,
*NL*
black
fox-skins
,
fine
ermines
,
&
c.
-LRB-
which
I
sold
at
Archangel
at
a
good
*NL*
price
-RRB-
we
set
out
from
this
city
the
beginning
of
June
,
making
a
small
*NL*
caravan
,
being
about
thirty-two
horses
and
camels
,
of
which
I
*NL*
represented
the
head
.
My
young
Lord
had
with
him
a
very
faithful
*NL*
Siberian
servant
,
well
acquainted
with
the
roads
:
We
shunned
the
*NL*
principal
towns
and
cities
,
as
Tumen
,
Soli
Kamoskoi
,
and
several
others
,
*NL*
by
reason
of
their
strictness
in
examining
travellers
,
lest
any
of
the
*NL*
banished
persons
of
distinction
should
escape
.
Having
passed
the
river
*NL*
Kama
,
we
came
to
a
city
on
the
European
side
,
called
Soloy
Kamoskoi
,
*NL*
where
we
found
the
people
mostly
Pagans
as
before
.
We
then
passed
a
*NL*
desert
of
about
two
hundred
miles
over
;
but
in
other
places
it
is
near
*NL*
seven
hundred
.
In
passing
this
wild
place
,
we
were
beset
by
a
troop
of
*NL*
men
on
horseback
,
and
about
five
and
forty
men
armed
with
bows
and
*NL*
arrows
.
At
first
they
looked
earnestly
on
us
,
and
then
placed
themselves
*NL*
in
our
way
.
We
were
above
sixteen
men
,
and
drew
up
a
little
line
before
*NL*
our
camels
.
My
young
Lord
sent
out
his
Siberian
servant
,
to
know
who
*NL*
they
were
;
but
,
when
he
approached
them
,
he
neither
knew
a
word
they
*NL*
said
;
nor
would
they
admit
him
to
come
near
them
at
his
peril
,
but
*NL*
prepared
to
shoot
him
.
At
his
return
,
he
told
us
he
believed
them
to
be
*NL*
Calmuc
Tartars
;
and
that
there
were
more
upon
the
desert
.
This
was
but
a
*NL*
small
comfort
to
us
;
yet
seeing
a
little
grove
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
's
distance
,
we
moved
to
it
,
by
the
old
Portuguese
pilot
's
advice
,
*NL*
without
meeting
with
any
opposition
.
Here
we
found
a
marshy
piece
of
*NL*
ground
,
and
a
spring
of
water
running
into
a
little
brook
on
one
side
,
*NL*
which
joined
another
like
it
a
little
further
off
,
and
these
two
formed
*NL*
the
head
of
the
river
called
Writska
.
As
soon
as
we
arrived
,
we
went
to
*NL*
work
,
cutting
great
arms
off
the
trees
,
and
laying
them
hanging
-LRB-
not
*NL*
quite
off
from
one
tree
to
another
-RRB-
.
In
this
situation
we
waited
the
*NL*
motion
of
the
enemy
,
without
perceiving
any
advancement
they
made
*NL*
towards
us
.
About
two
hours
before
night
,
being
joined
by
some
others
,
*NL*
in
all
about
fourscore
horse
,
among
whom
we
fancied
were
some
women
,
*NL*
they
came
upon
us
with
great
fury
.
We
fired
without
ball
,
calling
to
*NL*
them
in
the
Russian
tongue
,
to
know
their
business
;
but
they
,
either
not
*NL*
knowing
,
or
seeming
not
to
understand
us
,
came
directly
to
the
wood
*NL*
side
,
nor
considering
that
we
were
to
be
fortified
,
as
that
they
could
*NL*
not
break
in
.
Our
old
pilot
,
the
Portuguese
,
proved
both
our
captain
and
*NL*
engineer
,
and
desired
us
not
to
fire
,
till
they
came
within
pistol
shot
;
*NL*
and
when
he
gave
the
word
of
command
,
then
to
take
the
surest
aim
:
but
*NL*
he
did
not
bid
us
give
fire
,
till
they
were
within
two
pikes
length
of
*NL*
us
,
and
then
we
filled
fourteen
of
them
,
wounded
several
,
as
also
their
*NL*
horses
,
having
every
one
of
us
loaded
our
pieces
with
two
or
three
*NL*
bullets
at
least
.
So
much
were
they
surprised
at
our
undauntedness
,
that
*NL*
they
retired
about
a
hundred
roods
from
us
.
In
the
mean
while
we
loaded
*NL*
our
pieces
again
,
and
sallying
out
,
secured
four
or
five
of
their
*NL*
horses
,
whose
riders
we
found
were
killed
,
and
perceived
them
to
be
*NL*
Tartars
.
About
an
hour
after
,
they
made
another
attempt
,
to
see
where
*NL*
they
might
break
in
;
but
finding
us
ready
to
receive
them
,
they
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
night
we
wrought
hard
,
in
strengthening
our
situation
,
and
*NL*
barricading
the
entrances
into
the
woods
;
but
when
day-light
came
,
we
*NL*
had
a
very
unwelcome
discovery
;
for
the
enemy
,
being
encouraged
by
*NL*
their
numbers
,
had
set
up
eleven
or
twelve
tents
,
in
form
of
a
camp
,
*NL*
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
us
.
I
must
confess
,
I
was
never
more
*NL*
concerned
in
my
life
,
giving
myself
and
all
that
I
had
over
for
lost
.
*NL*
And
my
partner
declared
,
that
as
the
loss
of
his
goods
would
be
his
*NL*
ruin
,
before
they
should
be
taken
from
him
,
he
would
fight
to
the
last
*NL*
drop
of
his
blood
.
As
we
could
not
pretend
to
force
our
way
,
we
had
*NL*
recourse
to
a
stratagem
;
we
kindled
a
large
fire
,
which
burnt
all
night
;
*NL*
and
no
sooner
was
it
dark
,
but
we
pursued
our
journey
towards
the
pole
*NL*
or
north
star
,
and
travelling
all
night
;
by
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
*NL*
we
came
to
a
Russian
village
called
Kertza
,
and
from
thence
came
to
a
*NL*
large
town
named
Ozonzoys
,
where
we
heard
that
several
troops
of
Calmuc
*NL*
Tartars
had
been
abroad
upon
the
desert
,
but
that
we
were
past
all
*NL*
danger
.
In
five
days
after
we
came
to
Veuslima
,
upon
the
river
Witzedga
;
*NL*
from
thence
we
came
to
Lawrenskoy
,
on
the
third
of
July
,
where
,
*NL*
providing
ourselves
with
two
luggage
boats
,
and
a
convenient
bark
,
we
*NL*
embarked
the
seventh
,
and
arrived
at
Archangel
the
eighteenth
,
after
a
*NL*
year
,
five
months
,
and
three
days
journey
,
including
the
eight
months
*NL*
and
odd
days
at
Tobolski
.
We
came
from
Archangel
the
20th
of
August
in
*NL*
the
same
year
,
and
arrived
at
Hamburg
the
30th
of
September
.
Here
my
*NL*
partner
and
I
made
a
very
good
sale
of
our
goods
,
both
those
of
China
*NL*
and
Siberia
;
when
dividing
our
effects
,
my
share
came
to
3475l
.
17s
.
3d
.
*NL*
after
all
the
losses
we
had
sustained
,
and
charges
we
had
been
at
.
Here
*NL*
the
young
Lord
took
his
leave
of
me
,
in
order
to
go
to
the
court
of
*NL*
Vienna
,
not
only
to
seek
protection
,
but
to
correspond
with
his
father
's
*NL*
friends
.
After
we
had
staid
four
months
in
Hamburgh
,
I
went
from
thence
*NL*
overland
to
the
Hague
,
where
embarking
in
the
packet
,
I
arrived
in
*NL*
London
the
10th
of
January
1705
,
after
ten
years
and
nine
months
absence
*NL*
from
England

CHAP

I.
Of
SOLITUDE
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
solitude
is
looked
upon
as
a
restraint
to
the
pleasure
of
the
*NL*
world
,
in
company
and
conversation
,
yet
it
is
a
happy
state
of
exemption
*NL*
from
a
sea
of
trouble
,
an
inundation
of
vanity
and
vexation
,
of
*NL*
confusion
and
disappointment
.
While
we
enjoy
ourselves
,
neither
the
joy
*NL*
not
sorrow
of
other
men
affect
us
:
We
are
then
at
liberty
with
the
voice
*NL*
of
our
soul
,
to
speak
to
God
.
By
this
we
shun
such
frequent
trivial
*NL*
discourse
,
as
often
becomes
an
obstruction
to
virtue
:
and
how
often
do
*NL*
we
find
that
we
had
reason
to
with
we
had
not
been
in
company
,
or
said
*NL*
nothing
when
we
were
there
?
for
either
we
offend
God
by
the
impiety
of
*NL*
our
discourse
,
or
lay
ourselves
open
to
the
violence
of
designing
people
*NL*
by
our
ungarded
expressions
;
and
frequently
feel
the
coldness
and
*NL*
treachery
of
pretended
friends
,
when
once
involved
in
trouble
and
*NL*
affliction
:
of
such
unfaithful
intimates
-LRB-
I
should
say
enemies
-RRB-
who
*NL*
rather
by
false
inuendoes
would
accumulate
miseries
upon
us
,
than
*NL*
honestly
assist
us
when
under
the
hard
hand
of
adversity
.
But
in
a
state
*NL*
of
solitude
,
when
our
tongues
can
not
be
heard
,
except
from
the
great
*NL*
Majesty
of
Heaven
,
how
happy
are
we
,
in
the
blessed
enjoyment
of
*NL*
conversing
with
our
Maker
!
It
is
then
we
make
him
our
friend
,
which
sets
*NL*
us
above
the
envy
and
contempt
of
wicked
men
.
When
a
man
converses
with
*NL*
himself
,
he
is
sure
that
he
does
not
converse
with
an
enemy
.
Our
retreat
*NL*
should
be
to
good
company
,
and
good
books
.
I
mean
not
by
solitude
,
that
*NL*
a
man
should
retire
into
a
cell
,
a
desert
,
or
a
monastry
:
which
would
be
*NL*
altogether
an
useless
and
unprofitable
restraint
:
for
as
men
ate
formed
*NL*
for
society
,
and
have
an
absolute
necessity
and
dependance
upon
one
*NL*
another
;
so
there
is
a
retirement
of
the
soul
,
with
which
it
converses
*NL*
in
heaven
,
even
in
the
midst
of
men
;
and
indeed
no
man
is
more
fit
to
*NL*
speak
freely
,
than
he
who
can
,
without
any
violence
himself
,
refrain
his
*NL*
tongue
,
or
keep
silence
altogether
.
As
to
religion
,
it
is
by
this
the
*NL*
foul
gets
acquainted
with
the
hidden
mysteries
of
the
holy
writings
;
*NL*
here
she
finds
those
floods
of
tears
,
in
which
good
men
wash
themselves
*NL*
day
and
night
,
and
only
makes
a
visit
to
God
,
and
his
holy
angels
.
In
*NL*
this
conversation
the
truest
peace
and
most
solid
joy
are
to
be
found
;
*NL*
it
is
a
continual
feast
of
contentment
on
earth
,
and
the
means
of
*NL*
attaining
everlasting
happiness
in
heaven
.

II
.
Of
HONESTY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Honesty
is
a
virtue
beloved
by
good
men
,
and
pretended
to
by
all
other
*NL*
persons
.
In
this
there
are
several
degrees
:
to
pay
every
man
his
own
is
*NL*
the
common
law
of
honesty
:
but
to
do
good
to
all
mankind
,
is
the
*NL*
chancery
law
of
honesty
:
and
this
chancery
court
is
in
every
man
's
*NL*
breast
,
where
his
conscience
is
a
Lord
Chancellor
.
Hence
it
is
,
that
a
*NL*
miser
,
though
he
pays
every
body
their
own
,
can
not
be
an
honest
man
,
*NL*
when
he
does
not
discharge
the
good
offices
that
are
incumbent
on
a
*NL*
friendly
,
kind
,
and
generous
person
:
for
,
faith
the
prophet
Isaiah

*NL*

_
The
instruments
of
a
churl
are
evil
:
he
*NL*
deviseth
wicked
devices
to
destroy
the
poor
with
lying
words
,
even
when
*NL*
the
needy
speaketh
right
.
But
the
liberal
soul
deviseth
liberal
things
,
*NL*
and
by
liberal
things
shall
he
stand
_
.
It
is
certainly
honest
to
do
*NL*
every
thing
the
law
requires
;
but
should
we
throw
every
poor
debtor
into
*NL*
prison
till
he
has
paid
the
utmost
farthing
,
hang
every
malefactor
*NL*
without
mercy
,
exact
the
penalty
of
every
bond
,
and
the
forfeiture
of
*NL*
every
indenture
,
this
would
be
downright
cruelty
,
and
not
honesty
:
and
*NL*
it
is
contrary
to
that
general
rule
,
_
To
do
to
another
,
that
which
you
*NL*
would
have
done
unto
you
_
.
Sometimes
necessity
makes
an
honest
man
a
*NL*
knave
:
and
a
rich
man
a
honest
man
,
because
he
has
no
occasion
to
be
a
*NL*
knave
.
The
trial
of
honesty
is
this
:
Did
you
ever
want
bread
,
and
had
*NL*
your
neighbour
's
loaf
in
keeping
,
and
would
starve
rather
than
eat
it
?
*NL*
Were
you
ever
arrested
,
having
in
your
custody
another
man
's
cash
,
and
*NL*
would
rather
go
to
gaol
,
than
break
it
?
if
so
,
this
indeed
may
be
*NL*
reckoned
honesty
.
For
King
Solomon
tells
us
,
_
That
a
good
name
is
better
*NL*
than
life
,
and
is
a
precious
ointment
,
and
which
,
when
a
man
has
once
*NL*
lost
,
he
has
nothing
left
worth
keeping

III
_
Of
the
present
state
of
Religion
in
the
world
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
,
indeed
,
there
is
much
more
devotion
than
religion
in
the
world
,
*NL*
more
adoration
than
supplication
,
and
more
hypocrisy
than
sincerity
;
and
*NL*
it
is
very
melancholy
to
consider
,
what
numbers
of
people
there
are
*NL*
furnished
with
the
powers
of
reason
and
gifts
of
nature
,
and
yet
*NL*
abandoned
to
the
grossest
ignorance
and
depravity
.
But
it
would
be
*NL*
uncharitable
for
us
to
imagine
-LRB-
as
some
Papists
,
abounding
with
too
much
*NL*
ill
nature
,
the
only
scandal
to
religion
,
do
-RRB-
that
they
will
certainly
*NL*
be
in
a
state
of
damnation
after
this
life
;
for
how
can
we
think
it
*NL*
consistent
with
the
mercy
and
goodness
of
an
infinite
Being
,
to
damn
*NL*
those
creatures
,
when
he
has
not
furnished
them
with
the
light
of
the
*NL*
gospel
?
or
how
can
such
proud
,
conceited
and
cruel
bigots
,
prescribe
*NL*
rules
to
the
justice
and
mercy
of
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
told
by
some
people
,
that
the
great
image
which
King
*NL*
Nebuchadnezzar
set
up
to
be
adored
by
his
people
held
the
representation
*NL*
of
the
sun
in
it
's
right
hand
,
as
the
principal
object
of
adoration
.
But
*NL*
to
wave
this
discourse
of
Heathens
,
how
many
self-contradicting
*NL*
principles
are
there
held
among
Christians
?
and
how
do
we
doom
one
*NL*
another
to
the
devil
,
while
all
profess
to
worship
the
same
Deity
,
and
*NL*
to
expect
the
same
salvation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
at
Portugal
,
there
was
held
at
that
time
the
court
of
justice
*NL*
of
the
Inquisition
.
All
the
criminals
were
carried
in
procession
to
the
*NL*
great
church
,
where
eight
of
them
were
habited
in
gowns
and
caps
of
*NL*
canvass
,
whereon
the
torments
of
hell
were
displayed
,
and
they
were
*NL*
condemned
and
burnt
for
crimes
against
the
Catholic
faith
and
*NL*
blessed
Virgin
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sorry
to
make
any
reflection
upon
Christians
;
but
indeed
,
in
Italy
*NL*
the
Roman
religion
seems
the
most
cruel
and
mercenary
upon
earth
;
and
a
*NL*
very
judicious
person
,
who
travelled
through
Italy
from
Turkey
,
tells
,
*NL*
_
That
there
is
only
the
face
and
outward
pomp
of
religion
there
;
that
*NL*
the
church
protects
murderers
and
assassins
;
and
then
delivers
the
civil
*NL*
magistrate
over
to
Satan
for
doing
justice
;
interdicts
whole
kingdoms
,
*NL*
and
shuts
up
the
churches
for
want
of
paying
a
few
ecclesiastical
dues
,
*NL*
and
so
puts
a
stop
to
religion
for
want
of
their
money
;
that
the
court
*NL*
of
Inquisition
burnt
two
men
for
speaking
dishonourably
of
the
Blessed
*NL*
Virgin
;
and
the
missionaries
of
China
tolerated
the
worshipping
the
*NL*
devil
by
their
new
converts
:
that
Italy
was
the
theatre
,
where
religion
*NL*
was
the
grand
opera
:
and
that
the
Popish
clergy
were
no
other
than
*NL*
stage
players
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
religion
in
Poland
,
they
deny
Christ
to
be
the
Messiah
,
or
that
*NL*
the
Messiah
has
come
in
the
flesh
.
And
as
to
their
Protestants
,
they
are
*NL*
the
followers
of
Laelius
Socinus
,
who
denied
our
Saviour
's
divinity
;
and
*NL*
have
no
concern
about
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
Holy
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Muscovy
their
churches
are
built
of
wood
,
and
,
indeed
,
they
have
but
*NL*
wooden
priests
,
though
of
the
Greek
church
;
they
pray
as
much
to
St.
*NL*
Nicholas
,
as
the
Papists
do
to
the
Virgin
Mary
,
for
protection
in
all
*NL*
their
difficulties
or
afflictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Lutherans
,
they
only
differ
from
the
Romans
in
believing
*NL*
consubstantiation
,
instead
of
transubstantiation
;
but
like
them
,
they
*NL*
are
much
pleased
with
the
external
gallantry
and
pomp
,
more
than
the
*NL*
true
and
real
practice
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
France
I
found
a
world
of
priests
,
the
streets
every
where
crowded
*NL*
with
them
,
and
the
churches
full
of
women
:
but
surely
never
was
a
nation
*NL*
so
full
of
blind
guides
,
so
ignorant
of
religion
,
and
even
as
void
of
*NL*
morals
,
as
those
people
who
confess
their
sins
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Does
it
not
seem
strange
,
that
,
while
all
men
own
the
Divine
Being
,
*NL*
there
should
be
so
many
different
opinions
as
to
the
manner
of
paying
*NL*
him
obedience
in
the
Christian
church
?
I
know
not
what
reason
to
assign
*NL*
for
this
,
except
it
be
their
different
capacities
and
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
upon
this
account
,
we
have
perceived
,
in
all
Christian
*NL*
countries
,
what
mortal
feuds
have
been
about
religion
;
what
wars
and
*NL*
bloodshed
have
molested
Europe
,
till
the
general
pacification
of
the
*NL*
German
troubles
at
the
treaty
of
Westphalia
:
and
since
those
times
,
what
*NL*
persecution
in
the
same
country
among
the
churches
of
the
Lutherans
;
and
*NL*
should
I
take
a
prospect
at
home
,
what
unhappy
divisions
are
between
*NL*
Christians
in
this
kingdom
,
about
Episcopacy
and
Presbytery
;
the
church
*NL*
of
England
and
the
Dissenters
opposing
one
another
like
St.
Paul
and
St.
*NL*
Peter
,
even
to
the
face
;
that
is
,
they
carry
on
the
dispute
to
the
*NL*
utmost
extremity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
a
question
,
why
there
are
such
differences
in
religious
*NL*
points
,
and
why
these
breaches
should
be
more
hot
and
irreconcileable
?
*NL*
All
the
answer
I
can
give
to
this
,
is
,
that
we
inquire
more
concerning
*NL*
the
truth
of
religion
,
than
any
other
nation
in
the
world
;
and
the
*NL*
anxious
concern
we
have
about
it
,
makes
us
jealous
of
every
opinion
,
and
*NL*
tenacious
of
our
own
;
and
this
is
not
because
we
are
more
furious
and
*NL*
rash
than
other
people
;
but
the
truth
is
,
we
are
more
concerned
about
*NL*
them
,
and
being
sensible
that
the
scripture
is
the
great
rule
of
faith
,
*NL*
the
standard
for
life
and
doctrine
,
we
have
recourse
to
it
ourselves
,
*NL*
without
submitting
to
any
pretended
infallible
judge
upon
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
another
question
,
pertinent
to
the
former
,
and
that
is
,
_
What
*NL*
remedy
can
we
apply
to
this
malady
_
?
And
to
this
I
must
negatively
*NL*
answer
,
_
Not
to
be
less
religious
,
that
we
may
differ
the
less
_
.
This
is
*NL*
striking
at
the
very
root
of
all
religious
differences
;
for
,
certainly
,
*NL*
were
they
to
be
carried
on
with
a
peaceable
spirit
,
willing
to
be
*NL*
informed
,
our
variety
of
opinions
would
not
have
the
name
of
*NL*
differences
;
nor
should
we
separate
in
communion
of
charity
though
we
*NL*
did
not
agree
in
several
articles
of
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
is
there
a
less
useful
question
to
start
,
namely
,
_
Where
will
our
*NL*
unhappy
religious
differences
end
?
_
To
which
,
I
hope
,
I
may
answer
,
_
In
*NL*
Heaven
_
;
there
we
shall
unchristian
and
unbrotherly
differences
will
*NL*
find
a
period
;
there
we
shall
embrace
many
a
sinner
,
that
here
we
think
*NL*
it
a
dishonour
to
converse
with
;
&
perceive
many
a
heart
we
have
broken
*NL*
here
with
censures
,
reproachings
,
&
revilings
,
made
whole
again
by
the
*NL*
balm
of
the
same
Redeemer
's
blood
.
Here
we
shall
perceive
there
have
*NL*
been
other
flocks
than
those
of
our
fold
;
that
those
we
have
*NL*
excommunicated
have
been
taken
into
that
superior
communion
;
and
,
in
a
*NL*
word
,
that
those
contradicting
notions
and
principles
which
we
thought
*NL*
inconsistent
with
true
religion
,
we
shall
then
find
reconcileable
to
*NL*
themselves
,
to
one
another
,
and
to
the
fountain
of
truth
.
If
any
man
ask
*NL*
me
,
Why
our
differences
can
not
be
ended
on
earth
?
I
answer
,
_
Were
we
all
*NL*
thoroughly
convinced
,
that
then
they
would
be
reconciled
,
we
would
put
*NL*
an
end
to
them
before
;
but
this
is
impossible
to
be
done
:
for
as
men
's
*NL*
certain
convictions
of
truth
are
not
equal
to
one
another
,
or
the
weight
*NL*
or
significancy
of
such
veracity
:
so
neither
can
a
general
effect
of
*NL*
this
affair
be
expected
on
this
side
of
time
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
conclude
this
chapter
,
I
shall
beg
leave
to
discourse
a
little
*NL*
of
the
wonderful
excellency
of
negative
religion
and
negative
virtue
.
*NL*
The
latter
sets
out
,
like
the
Pharisee
,
with
,
_
God
,
I
thank
thee
;
_
it
is
*NL*
a
piece
of
religious
pageantry
,
the
hypocrite
's
hope
:
and
,
in
a
word
,
it
*NL*
is
positive
vice
:
for
it
is
either
a
mask
to
deceive
others
,
or
a
mist
*NL*
to
deceive
ourselves
.
A
man
that
is
clothed
with
negatives
,
thus
argues
:
*NL*
_
I
am
not
such
a
drunkard
as
my
landlord
,
such
a
thief
as
my
tenant
,
*NL*
such
a
rakish
fellow
,
or
a
highwayman
;
No
!
I
live
a
sober
,
regular
,
*NL*
retired
life
:
I
am
a
good
man
,
I
go
to
church
;
God
,
I
thank
thee
.
_
Now
,
*NL*
through
a
mans
boasts
of
his
virtue
in
contradiction
to
the
vices
*NL*
mentioned
,
yet
a
person
had
better
have
them
altogether
than
the
man
*NL*
himself
;
or
he
is
so
full
of
himself
,
so
persuaded
that
he
is
good
and
*NL*
religious
enough
already
,
that
he
has
no
thoughts
of
any
thing
,
except
*NL*
it
be
to
pull
of
his
hat
to
God
Almighty
now
and
then
,
and
thank
him
*NL*
that
he
has
no
occasion
for
him
;
and
has
the
vanity
to
think
that
his
*NL*
neighbours
must
imagine
well
of
him
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
negative
man
,
though
he
is
no
drunkard
is
yet
intoxicated
with
the
*NL*
pride
of
his
own
worth
;
a
good
neighbour
and
peace-maker
in
other
*NL*
families
,
but
a
tyrant
in
his
own
;
appears
in
church
for
a
show
,
but
*NL*
never
falls
upon
his
knees
in
his
closet
;
does
all
his
alms
before
men
,
*NL*
to
be
seen
of
them
;
eager
in
the
duties
of
the
second
table
,
but
*NL*
regardless
of
the
first
;
appears
religious
,
to
be
taken
notice
of
by
*NL*
men
,
but
without
intercourse
or
communication
between
God
and
his
own
*NL*
soul
:
Pray
,
what
is
this
man
?
or
what
comfort
is
there
of
the
life
he
*NL*
lives
?
he
is
insensible
of
faith
,
repentance
,
and
a
Christian
mortified
*NL*
life
:
in
a
word
,
he
is
a
perfectly
a
stranger
to
the
essential
part
*NL*
of
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
for
a
while
enter
into
the
private
and
retired
part
of
his
*NL*
conversation
:
What
notions
has
he
of
his
mispent
hours
,
and
of
the
*NL*
progress
of
time
to
the
great
centre
and
gulph
of
life
,
eternity
?
Does
*NL*
he
know
how
to
put
a
right
value
on
time
,
or
esteem
the
life-blood
of
*NL*
his
soul
,
as
it
really
is
,
and
act
in
all
the
moments
of
it
,
as
one
that
*NL*
must
account
for
them
?
if
then
you
can
form
an
equality
between
what
he
*NL*
can
do
and
what
he
shall
receive
;
less
can
be
founded
upon
his
negative
*NL*
virtue
,
or
what
he
has
forborne
to
do
:
And
if
neither
his
negative
nor
*NL*
positive
piety
can
be
equal
to
the
reward
,
and
to
the
eternity
that
*NL*
reward
is
to
last
for
,
what
then
is
to
become
of
the
Pharisee
,
when
he
*NL*
is
to
be
judged
by
the
sincerity
of
his
repentance
,
and
rewarded
,
*NL*
according
to
the
infinite
grace
of
God
,
with
a
state
of
blessedness
to
*NL*
an
endless
eternity
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
negative
man
converses
with
the
invisible
world
,
he
is
filled
*NL*
with
as
much
horror
and
dread
as
Felix
,
when
St
Paul
reasoned
to
him
of
*NL*
temperance
,
righteousness
,
and
of
judgment
to
come
;
for
Felix
,
though
a
*NL*
great
philosopher
,
of
great
power
and
reverence
,
was
a
negative
man
,
and
*NL*
he
was
made
sensible
by
the
Apostle
,
that
,
as
a
life
of
virtue
and
*NL*
temperance
was
its
own
reward
,
by
giving
a
healthy
body
,
a
clear
head
,
*NL*
and
a
composed
life
,
so
eternal
happiness
must
proceed
from
another
*NL*
spring
;
namely
,
the
infinite
unbounded
grace
of
a
provoked
God
,
who
*NL*
having
erected
a
righteous
tribunal
,
Jesus
Christ
would
separate
such
as
*NL*
by
faith
and
repentance
he
had
brought
home
and
united
to
himself
by
the
*NL*
grace
of
adoption
,
and
on
the
foot
of
his
having
laid
down
his
life
as
a
*NL*
ransom
for
them
,
had
appointed
them
to
salvation
,
when
all
the
*NL*
philosophy
,
temperance
,
and
righteousness
in
the
world
besides
had
been
*NL*
ineffectual
.
And
this
,
I
say
,
it
was
,
that
made
Felix
,
this
negative
*NL*
man
tremble
.

_
Of
listening
to
the
voice
of
Providence
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magnificent
and
wise
King
Solomon
bids
us
cry
after
knowledge
,
and
*NL*
lift
up
our
voice
for
understanding
;
by
which
is
meant
,
religious
*NL*
knowledge
,
for
it
follows
:
_
Then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
*NL*
Lord
,
and
find
the
knowledge
of
God
_
.
By
which
undoubtedly
he
meant
,
to
*NL*
enquire
after
every
thing
he
has
permitted
us
to
know
,
and
not
to
search
*NL*
into
those
ways
that
are
unsearchable
,
and
are
effectually
locked
up
*NL*
from
our
knowledge
.
--
Now
,
_
as
listening
to
the
voice
of
Providence
_
is
*NL*
my
present
subject
,
I
intend
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
write
to
those
who
*NL*
own
,
1
.
That
there
is
a
God
,
a
first
great
moving
cause
of
all
things
,
*NL*
and
eternal
power
,
prior
,
and
consequently
superior
to
all
created
power
*NL*
or
being
.
--
2
.
That
this
eternal
power
,
which
is
God
,
is
the
sovereign
*NL*
creator
and
governor
of
heaven
and
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
all
needless
distinctions
,
what
persons
in
the
God-head
*NL*
exercise
the
creating
,
and
what
the
governing
power
,
I
offer
that
*NL*
glorious
text
,
Psal
.
xxiii
.
6
.
where
the
whole
Trinity
is
entitled
to
*NL*
the
whole
creating
work
:
and
,
therefore
,
in
the
next
place
,
I
shall
lay
*NL*
down
these
two
propositions
.
*NL*
*NL*
I.
_
That
the
eternal
God
guides
,
by
his
providence
,
the
whole
*NL*
universe
,
which
was
created
by
his
power
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
II
.
_
That
this
providence
manifests
a
particular
care
over
,
and
*NL*
concern
in
,
the
governing
and
directing
man
,
the
most
noble
*NL*
creature
upon
earth
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
plain
,
that
natural
religion
proves
the
first
,
by
intimating
the
*NL*
necessity
of
a
providence
guiding
and
governing
the
world
,
from
the
*NL*
consequence
of
the
wisdom
,
justice
,
prescience
,
and
goodness
of
the
*NL*
Almighty
Creator
:
for
otherwise
it
would
be
absurd
to
think
,
that
God
*NL*
should
create
a
world
,
without
any
care
or
providence
over
it
,
in
*NL*
guiding
the
operations
of
nature
,
so
as
to
preserve
the
order
of
*NL*
his
creation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revealed
religion
gives
us
a
light
into
the
care
and
concern
of
his
*NL*
providence
,
by
the
climate
's
being
made
habitable
,
the
creatures
*NL*
subjected
and
made
nourishing
,
and
all
vegetative
life
made
medicinal
;
*NL*
and
all
this
for
the
sake
of
man
,
who
is
made
viceroy
to
the
King
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
The
short
description
I
shall
give
of
providence
is
this
:
_
That
*NL*
it
is
that
operation
of
the
power
,
of
the
wisdom
,
and
goodness
of
God
,
*NL*
by
which
be
influences
,
governs
,
and
directs
,
not
only
the
means
,
but
*NL*
the
events
of
all
things
,
which
concern
us
in
this
sublunary
world
;
the
*NL*
sovereignty
of
which
we
ought
always
to
reverence
,
obey
its
motions
,
*NL*
observe
its
dictates
,
and
listen
to
its
voice
.
The
prudent
man
forseeth
*NL*
the
evil
,
and
hideth
himself
;
that
is
,
as
I
take
it
,
there
is
a
secret
*NL*
providence
intimates
to
us
,
that
some
danger
threatens
,
if
we
strive
not
*NL*
to
shun
it
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
that
Sir
John
Hotham
kept
out
Hull
against
the
royal
martyr
*NL*
King
Charles
I.
the
same
day
Sir
John
Hotham
was
put
to
death
by
the
*NL*
parliament
for
that
very
action
:
The
same
day
that
the
King
himself
*NL*
signed
the
warrant
for
the
execution
of
the
Earl
of
Stafford
,
the
same
*NL*
day
of
the
month
was
he
barbarously
murdered
by
the
blood-thirsty
*NL*
Oliverian
crew
:
and
the
same
day
that
King
James
II
.
came
to
the
crown
*NL*
against
the
bill
of
exclusion
,
the
same
day
he
was
voted
abdicated
by
*NL*
the
parliament
,
and
the
throne
filled
with
King
William
and
Queen
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
signal
deliverances
from
sudden
dangers
,
is
not
only
a
just
*NL*
call
to
repentance
,
but
a
caution
against
falling
into
the
like
danger
;
*NL*
but
such
who
are
utterly
careless
of
themselves
after
,
show
a
lethargy
*NL*
of
the
worst
nature
,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
practical
atheism
*NL*
or
at
least
,
a
living
in
a
contempt
of
Heaven
,
when
he
receives
good
at
*NL*
the
hand
of
his
Maker
,
but
is
unconcerned
from
whence
it
comes
,
or
to
*NL*
thank
the
bountiful
hand
that
gave
it
;
neither
,
when
he
receives
evil
,
*NL*
does
it
alter
his
manner
of
life
,
or
bring
him
to
any
state
of
*NL*
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
a
remarkable
story
of
two
soldiers
being
condemned
to
death
in
*NL*
Flanders
.
The
general
being
prevailed
upon
to
spare
one
of
them
,
ordered
*NL*
them
to
cast
dice
upon
the
drumhead
for
their
lives
;
the
first
having
*NL*
thrown
two
sixes
,
the
second
fell
a
wringing
his
hands
,
having
so
poor
a
*NL*
chance
to
escape
;
however
,
having
thrown
,
he
was
surprised
when
he
also
*NL*
threw
other
two
sixes
.
The
officer
appointed
to
see
the
execution
,
*NL*
ordered
them
to
throw
again
;
they
did
so
,
and
each
of
them
threw
fives
;
*NL*
at
which
the
soldiers
that
stood
round
,
shouted
,
and
said
,
neither
of
*NL*
them
was
to
die
.
Upon
this
,
the
officer
acquainted
the
council
of
war
,
*NL*
who
ordered
them
to
throw
a
third
time
,
when
they
threw
two
fours
:
the
*NL*
general
being
acquainted
with
it
,
sent
for
the
men
,
and
pardoned
them
.
*NL*
_
I
love
,
_
said
he
,
_
in
such
extraordinary
cases
,
to
listen
to
the
voice
*NL*
of
Providence
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
We
read
in
the
holy
writings
,
how
God
speaks
to
men
by
appearance
of
*NL*
angels
,
or
by
dreams
and
visions
of
the
night
.
As
God
appeared
to
*NL*
Abraham
,
Lot
,
and
Jacob
:
so
angels
have
appeared
to
many
in
other
cases
,
*NL*
as
to
Manoah
and
his
wife
,
Zechariah
,
the
Virgin
Mary
,
and
to
the
*NL*
apostles
;
other
have
been
warned
in
a
dream
as
king
Abimelech
,
the
false
*NL*
prophet
Balaam
,
and
many
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certainly
a
very
great
and
noble
inquiry
,
_
What
we
shall
be
after
*NL*
this
life
?
_
for
there
is
scarce
a
doubt
,
that
there
is
a
place
reserved
*NL*
for
the
reception
of
our
souls
after
death
:
for
if
we
are
to
be
,
we
must
*NL*
have
a
where
,
which
the
scriptures
assert
by
the
examples
of
Dives
and
*NL*
Lazarus
.
The
doctrine
of
spirits
was
long
believed
before
our
Saviour
's
*NL*
time
;
for
when
the
disciples
of
the
blessed
Jesus
perceived
our
Saviour
*NL*
walking
on
the
sea
,
they
were
as
much
surprised
as
though
they
had
seen
*NL*
a
spirit
.
Nay
,
in
those
ages
of
the
world
,
it
was
believed
that
spirits
*NL*
intermeddled
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
;
and
,
throughout
the
Old
*NL*
Testament
,
I
do
not
find
any
thing
that
in
the
least
contradicts
is
.
All
*NL*
the
pains
and
labour
that
some
learned
men
have
taken
,
to
confute
the
*NL*
story
of
the
witch
of
Endor
,
and
the
appearance
of
an
old
man
*NL*
personating
Samuel
,
can
not
make
such
apparitions
inconsistent
with
*NL*
nature
or
religion
;
and
it
is
plain
,
that
it
was
either
a
good
or
bad
*NL*
spirit
,
that
prophetically
told
the
unfortunate
king
what
should
happen
*NL*
the
next
day
;
for
,
said
the
spirit
,
_
The
Lord
will
deliver
thee
into
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
Philistines
;
and
to-morrow
shalt
thou
and
thy
sons
be
*NL*
with
me
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Abundance
of
strange
notions
possessed
me
,
when
I
was
in
the
desolate
*NL*
island
;
especially
on
a
moonshine
night
,
when
every
bush
seemed
a
man
,
*NL*
and
every
tree
a
man
on
horseback
.
When
I
crept
into
the
dismal
cave
*NL*
where
the
old
goat
lay
expiring
,
whole
articulate
groans
even
resembled
*NL*
those
of
a
man
,
how
was
I
surprised
!
my
blood
chilled
in
my
veins
,
*NL*
a
cold
sweaty
dew
sat
on
my
forehead
,
my
hair
stood
upright
,
and
my
*NL*
joints
,
like
Belshazzar
's
knees
,
struck
against
one
another
.
And
,
indeed
,
*NL*
though
I
afterwards
found
what
it
was
,
the
remains
of
this
surprise
did
*NL*
not
wear
off
for
a
great
while
;
and
I
had
frequently
returns
of
those
*NL*
vapours
on
different
occasions
,
and
sometimes
without
any
occasion
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
after
having
seen
some
appearance
in
the
air
,
as
I
had
just
*NL*
lain
down
in
my
bed
,
one
of
my
feet
pained
me
;
after
that
came
a
*NL*
numbness
,
succeeded
with
a
tingling
in
my
blood
;
when
on
a
sudden
I
*NL*
thought
something
alive
lay
upon
me
,
from
my
knee
to
above
half
my
leg
.
*NL*
Upon
this
I
flung
myself
out
of
bed
where
I
thought
the
creature
lay
;
*NL*
but
finding
nothing
,
_
Lord
deliver
me
from
evil
spirits
_
,
said
I
,
_
what
*NL*
can
this
be
?
_
When
I
lighted
a
candle
,
I
could
perceive
no
living
*NL*
creature
in
the
place
with
me
,
but
the
poor
parrot
,
who
,
being
frighted
,
*NL*
cried
out
,
_
Hold
your
tongue
_
,
and
_
What
's
the
matter
with
you
_
,
which
*NL*
words
I
had
taught
him
,
by
saying
so
to
him
,
when
he
made
such
screaming
*NL*
noises
as
I
did
not
like
.
_
Lord
_
,
said
I
aloud
,
_
surely
the
devil
has
*NL*
been
here
.
_
_
Hold
your
tongue
_
,
says
Poll
.
I
was
then
mad
at
the
bird
,
*NL*
and
putting
on
my
clothes
,
cried
,
_
I
am
terribly
frighted
.
_
_
What
's
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
_
?
says
Poll
.
_
You
toad
_
,
said
I
,
_
I
'll
knock
your
brains
*NL*
out
.
_
_
Hold
you
tongue
_
,
cried
he
again
,
and
so
fell
a
chattering
,
and
*NL*
calling
Robinson
Crusoe
,
as
he
did
before
.
But
after
I
had
composed
*NL*
myself
,
and
went
to
bed
again
,
I
began
plainly
to
see
it
was
a
distemper
*NL*
that
affected
my
nerves
,
and
so
my
terrors
vanished
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
intelligences
are
given
or
received
,
we
do
not
know
;
nor
are
we
*NL*
sensible
how
they
are
conveyed
from
spirits
embodied
to
ours
that
are
*NL*
in
life
;
or
,
on
the
contrary
,
from
us
to
them
;
the
latter
is
certainly
*NL*
done
without
help
of
the
organs
,
and
the
former
is
conveyed
by
the
*NL*
understanding
,
and
the
retired
faculties
of
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirits
,
without
the
help
of
voices
,
converse
,
and
the
more
*NL*
particular
discoveries
of
converse
of
the
spirits
,
seem
to
me
as
*NL*
follow
:
to
wit
,
dreams
,
voices
,
noises
,
impulses
,
hints
,
apprehensions
,
*NL*
involuntary
sadness
,
&
c.
*NL*
*NL*
Dreams
of
old
were
the
ways
by
which
God
himself
was
pleased
to
warn
*NL*
men
what
services
to
perform
,
and
what
to
shun
.
Joseph
was
directed
of
*NL*
God
in
a
dream
to
go
to
Egypt
;
and
so
were
the
wise
men
warned
in
a
*NL*
dream
to
depart
into
their
own
country
another
way
,
to
avoid
the
fury
*NL*
of
Herod
.
I
am
not
like
those
who
think
dreams
are
the
mere
designs
of
*NL*
a
delirious
head
,
or
the
relics
of
a
day
's
perplexities
or
pleasures
;
*NL*
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
must
beg
leave
to
say
,
I
never
met
with
any
*NL*
capital
mischief
in
my
life
,
but
I
had
some
notice
of
it
by
a
dream
;
*NL*
and
had
I
not
been
a
thoughtless
unbelieving
creature
,
I
might
have
*NL*
taken
many
a
warning
,
and
avoided
many
of
the
evils
I
afterwards
fell
*NL*
into
,
merely
by
total
neglect
of
those
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
once
present
at
a
dispute
between
a
layman
and
a
clergyman
,
upon
*NL*
the
subject
of
dreams
.
The
first
thought
no
regard
should
be
given
unto
*NL*
them
;
that
their
communication
from
the
invisible
to
the
visible
world
*NL*
was
a
mere
chimera
,
without
any
solid
foundation
.
For
,
first
,
said
he
,
*NL*
if
dreams
were
from
the
agency
of
any
prescient
being
,
the
motives
would
*NL*
be
more
direct
,
and
the
discoveries
more
plain
,
and
not
by
allegories
*NL*
and
emblematic
fancies
,
expressing
things
imperfect
and
obscure
.
2
.
*NL*
Since
,
with
the
notice
of
evil
,
there
was
not
a
power
given
to
avoid
it
,
*NL*
it
is
not
likely
to
proceed
from
a
spirit
,
but
merely
fortuitious
.
3
.
*NL*
That
the
inconstancy
of
such
notices
,
in
cases
equally
important
,
proves
*NL*
they
did
not
proceed
from
any
such
agent
.
4
.
That
as
our
most
distinct
*NL*
dreams
had
nothing
in
them
of
any
significancy
,
it
would
be
irrational
*NL*
and
vain
to
think
that
they
came
from
heaven
.
And
,
5
.
That
as
men
were
*NL*
not
always
thus
warned
or
supplied
with
notice
of
good
or
evil
,
so
all
*NL*
men
are
not
alike
supplied
with
them
;
and
what
reason
could
we
give
,
*NL*
why
one
man
or
one
woman
should
not
have
the
same
hints
as
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
the
clergyman
gave
answer
:
1
.
That
as
to
the
signification
of
*NL*
dreams
,
&
the
objections
against
them
,
as
being
dark
and
doubtful
,
they
are
*NL*
expressed
generally
by
hierogliphical
representations
,
similies
,
allusions
,
*NL*
and
figurative
emblematic
ways
,
by
which
means
,
for
want
of
interpretation
,
*NL*
the
thing
was
not
understood
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
evil
not
shunned
.
2
.
*NL*
That
we
charge
God
foolishly
,
to
say
,
that
he
has
given
the
notice
of
evil
,
*NL*
without
the
power
to
avoid
it
;
for
,
if
any
one
had
not
power
to
avoid
the
*NL*
evil
,
it
was
no
notice
to
him
;
and
it
was
want
of
giving
due
head
to
that
*NL*
notice
,
that
men
first
neglected
themselves
,
and
then
charged
the
Judge
of
*NL*
all
the
earth
with
injustice
.
3
.
That
we
ought
not
to
find
fault
with
the
*NL*
inconstancy
of
these
notices
;
but
rather
with
our
weak
understandings
,
by
*NL*
pretending
dreams
were
not
to
be
regarded
,
and
negligent
when
the
voice
*NL*
really
spoke
to
us
for
our
good
.
It
is
a
mistake
to
say
,
dreams
have
no
*NL*
import
at
all
:
we
might
,
with
more
reason
,
have
said
,
none
that
we
could
*NL*
perceive
the
reason
of
,
owing
to
our
blindness
and
supine
negligence
,
too
*NL*
secure
at
one
time
,
and
too
much
alarmed
at
another
;
so
that
the
spirit
,
*NL*
which
we
might
be
said
to
be
conversing
with
in
a
dream
,
was
constantly
*NL*
and
equally
kind
and
careful
;
but
our
powers
are
not
always
in
the
same
*NL*
state
of
action
,
not
equally
attentive
too
,
or
retentive
of
the
hints
*NL*
that
were
given
.
And
,
5
.
To
answer
the
last
question
,
Why
people
are
not
*NL*
equally
supplied
?
This
seemed
to
be
no
question
;
for
Providence
itself
*NL*
might
have
some
share
in
the
direction
of
it
,
and
then
that
Providence
*NL*
might
be
limited
by
a
superior
direction
;
that
as
to
the
converse
of
*NL*
spirits
,
he
could
not
call
it
a
stated
converse
:
such
a
thing
there
was
,
*NL*
but
why
there
was
so
much
of
it
,
and
no
more
,
was
none
of
his
business
,
*NL*
and
that
no
such
discovery
had
ever
yet
been
made
to
mankind
.
Nor
were
*NL*
we
to
imagine
less
of
waking
dreams
,
trances
,
visions
,
noises
,
hints
,
*NL*
impulses
,
and
all
the
waking
testimonies
of
an
invisible
world
,
and
of
*NL*
the
communication
that
there
is
between
us
and
them
,
which
commonly
*NL*
entertain
us
with
our
open
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
time
my
fancy
soared
on
high
,
to
see
what
discoveries
I
could
make
*NL*
in
those
clearer
regions
.
I
found
that
such
immense
bodies
as
the
sun
,
*NL*
stars
,
planets
,
and
moon
,
in
the
great
circle
of
the
lower
heaven
,
are
*NL*
far
from
being
found
in
the
study
of
nature
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
Here
I
saw
many
things
that
we
can
entertain
little
or
no
notion
of
,
in
*NL*
a
state
of
common
life
,
and
the
emptiness
of
our
notion
,
that
the
*NL*
planets
are
habitable
worlds
;
that
is
,
created
like
ours
,
for
the
*NL*
subsistence
and
existence
of
man
and
beast
,
and
the
preservation
of
the
*NL*
vegitative
and
sensitive
life
:
No
,
no
,
this
is
,
I
assure
you
,
a
world
of
*NL*
spirits
;
for
here
I
saw
a
clear
demonstration
of
Satan
being
the
_
prince
*NL*
of
the
power
of
the
air
_
,
keeping
his
court
or
camp
,
with
innumerable
*NL*
angels
to
attend
him
;
but
his
power
is
not
so
great
as
we
imagine
,
he
*NL*
can
tempt
us
to
the
crime
,
but
can
not
force
us
to
commit
:
_
Humanium
est
*NL*
peccare
_
.
Neither
has
the
devil
power
to
force
the
world
into
a
*NL*
rebellion
against
heaven
,
though
his
legions
are
employed
among
savage
*NL*
nations
,
to
set
up
their
master
for
a
god
,
who
make
the
heathens
either
*NL*
worship
him
in
person
,
or
by
his
representatives
,
idols
and
monsters
,
*NL*
with
the
cruel
sacrifices
of
human
blood
.
Now
,
as
to
the
limitations
of
*NL*
the
devil
's
power
,
you
must
understand
,
that
as
there
are
numbers
of
*NL*
evil
spirits
employed
in
mischief
,
so
there
are
numbers
of
good
angels
*NL*
sent
from
the
higher
and
blessed
abodes
to
disconcert
and
oppose
their
*NL*
measures
;
and
this
every
Christian
,
I
hope
,
believes
,
when
he
prays
to
*NL*
God
,
the
father
of
spirits
,
to
give
his
angels
charge
over
him
while
he
*NL*
slumbereth
and
sleepeth
.
For
if
by
these
preventing
powers
the
devil
was
*NL*
not
restrained
,
the
earth
would
be
subjected
to
dearth
,
droughts
,
and
*NL*
famine
;
the
air
infected
with
noxious
fumes
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
mankind
*NL*
would
be
utterly
destroyed
,
which
might
oblige
our
Maker
-LRB-
if
I
may
be
*NL*
allowed
the
expression
-RRB-
to
the
necessity
of
a
new
_
fiat
_
,
or
else
have
*NL*
no
more
creatures
to
honour
and
worship
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
devil
never
wanted
insinuators
,
I
shall
observe
,
that
I
learned
a
*NL*
way
how
to
make
a
man
dream
of
what
I
pleased
.
For
instance
,
let
us
suppose
*NL*
one
to
be
found
asleep
;
let
another
lay
his
mouth
close
to
his
ear
,
and
*NL*
whisper
any
thing
so
softly
as
not
to
awake
him
,
the
sleeping
man
shall
*NL*
dream
of
what
has
been
so
whispered
in
his
ear
;
nay
,
I
can
assure
you
,
*NL*
those
insinuating
devils
can
do
this
even
when
we
are
awake
,
which
I
call
*NL*
impulses
of
the
mind
:
for
from
whence
,
but
from
these
insinuators
,
come
*NL*
our
causeless
passions
,
involuntary
wickedness
,
or
sinful
desires
?
Who
*NL*
else
form
ideas
in
the
mind
of
man
when
he
is
asleep
,
or
present
terrible
*NL*
or
,
beautiful
figures
to
his
fancy
:
Mr.
Milton
represents
the
devil
*NL*
tempting
Eve
in
the
shape
of
a
toad
,
lying
just
at
her
ear
,
when
in
her
*NL*
bower
she
lay
fast
asleep
;
and
brings
in
Eve
telling
Adam
what
an
uneasy
*NL*
night
's
rest
she
had
,
and
relating
her
dream
to
him
.
And
likewise
I
*NL*
believe
that
good
spirits
have
the
same
intercourse
with
us
,
in
warning
*NL*
us
against
those
things
that
are
evil
,
and
prompting
us
to
that
which
is
*NL*
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Were
we
to
have
the
eyes
of
our
souls
opened
,
through
the
eyes
of
our
*NL*
bodies
,
we
should
see
this
very
immediate
region
or
air
which
we
breath
*NL*
in
,
thronged
with
spirits
now
invisible
,
and
which
otherwise
would
be
*NL*
the
most
terrible
;
we
should
view
the
secret
transactions
of
those
*NL*
messengers
who
are
employed
when
the
parting
soul
takes
it
's
leave
of
*NL*
the
reluctant
body
,
and
perhaps
see
things
nature
would
shrink
back
from
*NL*
with
the
utmost
terror
and
amazement
.
In
a
word
,
the
curtain
of
*NL*
Providence
for
the
disposition
of
things
here
,
and
the
curtain
of
*NL*
judgment
for
the
determination
of
the
state
of
souls
hereafter
,
would
be
*NL*
alike
drawn
back
;
and
what
heart
could
support
here
its
future
state
in
*NL*
life
;
much
less
that
,
of
its
future
state
after
life
,
even
good
or
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
,
being
about
seven
miles
distant
from
*NL*
London
,
a
friend
that
came
to
dine
with
him
,
solicited
him
to
go
to
the
*NL*
city
.
_
What
_
,
said
the
gentleman
,
_
is
there
any
occasion
for
me
?
No
,
*NL*
Sir
_
,
said
the
other
,
_
nothing
at
all
except
the
enjoyment
of
your
good
*NL*
company
_
:
and
so
gave
over
importuning
him
.
Just
then
a
strong
impulse
*NL*
of
mind
urged
the
gentleman
and
pursued
him
like
a
voice
,
with
,
_
Go
to
*NL*
London
,
Go
to
London
.
Hark
ye
_
,
says
he
to
his
friend
,
_
is
all
well
at
*NL*
London
?
Am
I
wanted
there
?
Or
did
you
ask
me
to
go
with
you
on
any
*NL*
particular
account
?
Are
all
my
family
well
?
Yes
,
indeed
,
Sir
_
,
said
he
,
*NL*
_
I
perceived
them
all
very
hearty
;
and
I
did
not
ask
you
to
go
to
London
*NL*
upon
any
particular
account
whatsoever
,
except
it
was
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
your
good
company
_
.
Again
,
he
put
off
his
resolution
:
but
still
the
*NL*
impulse
suggested
to
him
,
_
Go
to
London
_
;
and
at
length
he
did
so
.
When
*NL*
he
came
there
,
he
found
a
letter
and
a
messenger
had
been
there
to
seek
*NL*
him
,
and
to
tell
him
of
a
particular
business
,
which
was
at
first
and
*NL*
last
above
a
thousand
pounds
to
him
,
and
which
might
inevitably
have
*NL*
been
lost
,
had
he
hot
gone
to
London
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
obeying
of
several
hints
,
of
secret
impulses
,
argues
great
wisdom
.
*NL*
I
knew
a
man
that
was
under
misfortunes
,
being
guilty
of
misdemeanors
*NL*
against
the
goverment
;
when
,
absconding
for
fear
of
his
ruin
,
all
his
*NL*
friends
advising
him
not
to
put
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
law
,
one
*NL*
morning
as
he
awaked
,
he
felt
a
strong
impulse
darting
into
his
mind
*NL*
thus
,
_
Write
a
letter
to
them
;
_
and
this
was
repeated
several
times
to
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
at
last
he
answered
to
it
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
voice
,
*NL*
_
Whom
shall
I
write
to
?
_
Immediately
it
replied
,
_
Write
to
the
judge
:
_
*NL*
and
this
impulse
pursued
him
for
several
days
,
till
at
length
he
took
*NL*
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
sat
down
to
write
to
him
:
when
immediately
*NL*
words
flowed
from
his
pen
,
like
streams
from
a
fair
fountain
,
that
*NL*
charmed
even
himself
with
hopes
of
success
.
In
short
,
the
letter
was
so
*NL*
strenuous
in
argument
,
so
pathetic
in
its
eloquence
,
and
so
persuasively
*NL*
moving
,
that
when
the
judge
had
read
it
,
he
sent
him
an
answer
he
might
*NL*
be
easy
,
he
would
endeavour
to
make
that
matter
light
to
him
;
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
never
left
exerting
himself
,
till
he
had
stopt
the
prosecution
,
*NL*
and
restored
him
to
his
liberty
and
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
a
person
who
had
so
strong
an
impression
upon
her
mind
,
that
the
*NL*
house
she
was
in
would
be
burnt
that
very
night
,
that
she
could
not
*NL*
sleep
;
the
impulse
she
had
upon
her
mind
pressed
her
not
to
go
to
bed
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
she
got
over
,
and
went
to
bed
;
but
was
so
terrified
with
*NL*
the
thought
,
which
run
in
her
mind
,
that
the
house
would
be
burnt
,
that
*NL*
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
;
but
communicating
her
apprehensions
to
*NL*
another
in
the
family
,
they
were
both
in
such
a
fright
,
that
they
*NL*
applied
themselves
to
search
from
the
top
of
the
house
to
the
bottom
,
&
*NL*
to
see
every
fire
and
candle
safe
out
,
so
that
,
as
they
all
said
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
that
any
thing
could
happen
then
,
and
they
sent
to
the
*NL*
neighbours
on
both
sides
to
do
the
like
.
Thus
far
they
did
well
:
But
had
*NL*
she
obeyed
the
hint
which
pressed
upon
her
strangely
,
not
to
go
to
bed
,
*NL*
she
had
done
much
better
;
for
the
fire
was
actually
kindled
at
that
very
*NL*
time
,
though
not
broken
out
.
About
an
hour
after
the
whole
family
was
in
*NL*
bed
,
the
house
just
over
the
way
,
directly
opposite
,
was
all
in
flames
,
*NL*
and
the
wind
,
which
was
very
high
,
blowing
the
flame
upon
the
house
this
*NL*
gentlewoman
lived
in
,
so
filled
it
with
smoke
and
fire
,
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
the
street
being
narrow
,
that
they
had
not
air
to
breathe
,
or
*NL*
time
to
do
any
thing
,
but
jump
out
of
their
beds
,
and
save
their
lives
.
*NL*
Had
she
obeyed
the
hint
given
,
and
not
gone
to
bed
,
she
might
have
saved
*NL*
several
things
;
but
the
few
moments
she
had
spared
to
her
,
were
but
just
*NL*
sufficient
to
leap
out
of
bed
,
put
some
cloathes
on
,
and
get
down
*NL*
stairs
,
for
the
house
was
on
fire
in
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
am
mentioning
these
things
,
methinks
it
is
very
hard
that
we
*NL*
should
obey
the
whispers
of
evil
spirits
,
and
not
much
rather
receive
*NL*
the
notices
which
good
ones
are
pleased
to
give
.
We
never
perceive
the
*NL*
misfortune
of
this
,
but
when
in
real
danger
;
and
then
we
cry
,
_
My
mind
*NL*
misgave
me
when
I
was
going
about
it
_
;
but
if
so
,
why
do
you
fight
the
*NL*
caution
?
Why
not
listen
to
it
as
to
a
voice
?
and
then
there
had
been
no
*NL*
reason
to
make
this
complaint
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
-LRB-
as
to
time
I
can
not
be
*NL*
very
positive
-RRB-
there
was
a
young
clergyman
in
the
city
of
Dublin
,
in
*NL*
Ireland
,
who
dreamed
a
very
uncommon
dream
,
that
a
gentleman
had
killed
*NL*
his
wife
,
a
relation
of
his
,
by
stabbing
her
in
several
places
;
the
*NL*
fright
of
this
awaked
him
,
but
finding
it
a
dream
,
he
composed
himself
*NL*
again
to
sleep
,
when
he
dreamed
a
second
time
the
same
dream
.
This
made
*NL*
him
a
little
uneasy
;
but
thinking
it
proceeded
from
the
impression
made
*NL*
on
his
mind
by
the
former
,
he
went
to
sleep
again
,
and
dreamed
the
same
*NL*
dream
a
third
time
also
.
So
troubled
was
he
at
this
,
that
he
arose
,
and
*NL*
knocked
at
his
mother
's
chamber
,
told
his
concern
,
and
his
apprehensions
*NL*
that
all
was
not
right
at
his
relation
's
house
.
_
Dear
son
_
,
says
the
*NL*
good
old
gentlewoman
,
_
do
not
mind
these
foolish
dreams
;
and
I
very
much
*NL*
wonder
,
that
you
,
being
a
person
in
holy
orders
,
should
have
regard
to
*NL*
such
illusions
_
.
Upon
this
he
went
to
bed
again
,
fell
asleep
,
and
*NL*
dreamed
a
fourth
time
as
before
.
And
then
indeed
he
put
on
his
*NL*
night-gown
,
and
went
to
Smithfield
,
the
place
where
his
relation
dwelt
.
*NL*
Here
it
was
,
alas
!
he
perceived
his
dream
too
sadly
fulfilled
,
by
seeing
*NL*
his
relation
the
young
lady
,
big
with
child
,
who
was
a
Protestant
,
*NL*
stabbed
in
several
places
by
her
barbarous
husband
,
Mr.
Eustace
,
a
*NL*
violent
Papist
,
only
for
some
discourses
of
religion
that
happened
the
*NL*
day
before
.
After
the
wretch
had
stabbed
her
in
three
places
,
he
went
to
*NL*
make
his
escape
out
at
a
window
;
but
she
cried
out
,
_
My
dear
!
do
n't
*NL*
leave
me
,
come
back
,
and
I
shall
be
well
again
_
.
At
which
he
returned
in
*NL*
a
hellish
rage
,
and
gave
her
four
wounds
more
;
when
,
even
in
this
*NL*
condition
,
rising
from
her
bed
,
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
night-gown
,
*NL*
and
went
to
the
Lord
Bishop
of
Rapho
's
chamber
door
-LRB-
the
Bishop
lodging
*NL*
at
that
time
in
the
house
-RRB-
.
_
My
Lord
_
,
said
she
,
_
O
my
Lord
,
make
haste
*NL*
unto
me
_
;
but
as
soon
as
his
Lordship
came
,
she
expired
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
resigning
her
precious
soul
into
the
hands
of
Almighty
God
.
The
cruel
*NL*
wretch
her
husband
was
shot
by
the
pursuers
;
too
good
a
death
for
one
*NL*
who
deserved
the
gibbet
;
and
the
lady
was
universally
lamented
by
all
*NL*
tender
and
religious
people
.
And
this
tragical
relation
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
,
upon
the
account
of
that
impulse
,
or
dream
,
that
the
*NL*
clergyman
had
at
the
fatal
time
of
the
bloody
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
expected
I
should
enter
upon
the
subject
of
apparitions
,
*NL*
and
discourse
concerning
the
reality
of
them
;
and
whether
they
can
*NL*
revisit
the
place
of
their
former
existence
,
and
resume
those
faculties
*NL*
of
speech
and
shape
as
they
had
when
living
;
but
,
as
these
are
very
*NL*
doubtful
matters
,
I
shall
only
make
a
few
observations
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
once
heard
of
a
man
that
would
allow
the
reality
of
apparitions
,
but
*NL*
laid
it
all
upon
the
devil
,
thinking
that
the
souls
of
men
departed
,
or
*NL*
good
men
,
did
never
appear
.
To
this
very
man
something
did
appear
:
He
*NL*
said
,
he
saw
the
shape
of
an
ancient
man
pass
by
him
in
the
dusk
,
who
,
*NL*
holding
up
his
hand
in
a
threatening
posture
,
cried
out
,
_
O
wicked
man
,
*NL*
repent
,
repent
_
.
Terrified
with
this
apparition
,
he
consulted
several
*NL*
friends
,
who
advised
him
to
take
the
advice
.
But
after
all
,
it
was
not
*NL*
an
apparition
,
but
a
grave
and
pious
gentleman
,
who
met
him
by
mere
*NL*
accident
,
and
had
been
sensible
of
his
wickedness
;
and
who
never
*NL*
undeceived
him
,
lest
it
should
hinder
his
reformation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
people
make
a
very
ill
use
of
the
general
notion
,
that
there
are
no
*NL*
apparitions
nor
spirits
at
all
:
which
is
worse
than
those
who
fancy
they
*NL*
see
them
upon
every
occasion
;
for
those
carry
their
notions
farther
,
*NL*
even
to
annihilate
the
devil
,
and
believe
nothing
about
him
,
neither
of
*NL*
one
kind
or
other
:
the
next
step
they
come
to
,
is
to
conclude
,
_
There
is
*NL*
no
God
_
,
and
so
atheism
takes
its
rise
in
the
same
sink
,
with
a
*NL*
carelessness
about
futurity
.
But
there
is
no
occasion
to
enter
upon
an
*NL*
argument
to
prove
the
being
of
the
Almighty
,
or
to
illustrate
his
power
*NL*
by
words
,
who
has
so
many
undeniable
testimonies
in
the
breasts
of
every
*NL*
rational
being
to
prove
his
existence
:
and
we
have
sufficient
proofs
*NL*
enough
to
convince
us
of
the
great
superintendency
of
Divine
Providence
*NL*
in
the
minutest
affairs
of
this
world
;
the
manifest
existence
of
the
*NL*
invisible
world
;
the
reality
of
spirits
,
and
intelligence
between
us
and
*NL*
them
.
What
I
have
said
,
I
hope
,
will
not
mislead
any
person
,
or
be
a
*NL*
means
whereby
they
may
delude
themselves
;
for
I
have
spoken
of
these
*NL*
things
with
the
utmost
seriousness
of
mind
,
and
with
a
sincere
and
*NL*
ardent
desire
for
the
general
good
and
benefit
of
the
world

_
Of
suffering
Afflictions
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Afflictions
are
common
to
all
mankind
;
and
whether
they
proceed
from
*NL*
losses
,
disappointments
,
or
the
malice
of
men
,
they
often
bring
their
*NL*
advantages
along
with
them
:
For
this
shews
man
the
vanity
and
*NL*
deceitfulness
of
this
life
,
and
is
an
occasion
of
rectifying
our
*NL*
measures
,
and
bringing
us
to
a
more
modest
opinion
of
ourselves
:
It
*NL*
tells
us
,
how
necessary
the
assistance
of
divine
grace
is
unto
us
,
when
*NL*
life
itself
becomes
a
burden
,
and
death
even
desirable
:
But
when
the
*NL*
greatest
oppression
comes
upon
us
,
we
must
have
recourse
to
patience
,
*NL*
begging
of
God
to
give
us
that
virtue
;
and
the
more
composed
,
we
are
*NL*
under
any
trouble
,
the
more
commendable
is
our
wisdom
,
and
the
larger
*NL*
will
be
our
recompense
.
Let
the
provocation
be
what
it
will
,
whether
*NL*
from
a
good-natured
and
conscientious
,
or
a
wicked
,
perverse
,
and
*NL*
vexatious
man
;
all
this
we
should
take
as
from
the
over-ruling
hand
of
*NL*
God
,
as
a
punishment
for
our
sins
.
Many
times
injured
innocence
may
be
*NL*
abused
by
false
oaths
,
or
the
power
of
wicked
,
jealous
,
or
malicious
*NL*
men
;
but
we
often
find
it
,
like
the
palm
,
rise
the
higher
the
more
it
is
*NL*
depressed
;
while
the
justice
of
God
is
eminently
remarkable
in
punishing
*NL*
those
,
one
way
or
other
,
who
desire
to
endeavour
to
procure
the
downfal
*NL*
of
an
innocent
man
:
Nor
does
God
fail
comforting
an
afflicted
person
,
*NL*
who
with
tears
and
prayers
solicits
the
throne
of
Heaven
for
deliverance
*NL*
and
protection
.
David
says
,
_
that
his
soul
was
full
of
trouble
,
and
his
*NL*
life
drew
near
unto
the
grave
_
.
But
certainly
David
's
afflictions
made
*NL*
him
eminently
remarkable
,
as
particularly
when
pursued
by
King
Saul
,
and
*NL*
hunted
as
a
partridge
over
the
mountains
.
But
one
thing
which
stands
by
*NL*
innocence
,
is
the
love
of
God
;
for
were
we
to
suffer
disgrace
,
nay
,
an
*NL*
ignominious
death
itself
,
what
consolation
does
our
innocence
procure
at
*NL*
our
latest
conflict
,
our
last
moments

_
Of
the
immorality
of
conversation
,
and
the
vulgar
errors
of
*NL*
behaviour
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
conversation
is
a
great
part
of
human
happiness
,
so
it
is
a
pleasant
*NL*
sight
to
behold
a
sweet
tempered
man
,
who
is
always
fit
for
it
;
to
see
*NL*
an
air
of
humour
and
pleasantness
sit
ever
upon
his
brow
,
and
even
*NL*
something
angelic
in
his
very
countenance
:
Whereas
,
if
we
observe
a
*NL*
designing
man
,
we
shall
find
a
mark
of
involuntary
sadness
break
in
upon
*NL*
his
joy
,
and
a
certain
insurrection
in
the
soul
,
the
natural
concomitant
*NL*
of
profligate
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
err
very
much
,
who
think
religion
,
or
a
strict
morality
discomposes
*NL*
the
mind
,
and
renders
it
unfit
for
conversation
;
for
it
rather
inspires
*NL*
us
to
innocent
mirth
,
without
such
a
counterfeit
joy
as
vitious
men
*NL*
appear
with
;
and
indeed
wit
is
as
consistent
with
religion
,
as
religion
*NL*
is
with
good
manners
;
nor
is
there
any
thing
in
the
limitation
of
virtue
*NL*
and
religion
that
should
abate
the
pleasures
of
this
world
,
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
rather
serves
to
increase
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
many
men
,
by
their
own
vice
and
intemperance
,
*NL*
disqualify
themselves
for
conversation
.
Conversation
is
immoral
,
where
*NL*
the
discourse
is
undecent
,
immodest
,
scandalous
,
slanderous
,
and
*NL*
abusive
.
How
great
is
their
folly
,
and
how
much
do
they
expose
*NL*
themselves
when
they
affront
their
best
friend
,
even
God
himself
,
who
*NL*
laughs
at
the
fool
_
when
his
fear
cometh
?
_
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
scandal
atheistical
and
immoral
discourse
gives
to
virtue
,
*NL*
ought
,
methinks
,
to
be
punished
by
all
good
magistrates
:
Make
a
man
once
*NL*
cease
to
believe
a
God
,
and
he
has
nothing
left
to
limit
his
soul
.
How
*NL*
incongruous
is
it
to
government
,
that
a
man
shall
be
punished
for
*NL*
drunkenness
,
and
yet
have
liberty
to
affront
,
and
even
deny
the
Majesty
*NL*
of
heaven
?
When
if
,
even
among
men
,
one
gives
the
lie
to
a
gentleman
in
*NL*
company
,
or
perhaps
speaks
an
affronting
word
,
a
quarrel
will
ensue
,
and
*NL*
a
combat
,
and
perhaps
murder
be
the
consequence
:
At
the
least
,
he
,
will
*NL*
prosecute
him
at
law
with
the
utmost
virulence
and
oppression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
to
be
refrained
,
is
obscene
discourse
,
which
is
the
*NL*
language
only
of
proficients
in
debauchery
,
who
never
repent
,
but
in
a
*NL*
gaol
or
hospital
;
and
whose
carcases
relish
no
better
than
their
*NL*
discourse
,
till
the
body
becomes
too
nasty
for
the
soul
to
stay
any
*NL*
longer
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
is
false
talking
to
be
less
avoided
;
for
lying
is
the
sheep
's
*NL*
clothing
hung
upon
the
wolf
's
back
:
It
is
the
Pharisee
's
prayer
,
the
*NL*
whore
's
buss
,
the
hypocrite
's
paint
,
the
murderer
's
smile
,
the
thief
's
*NL*
cloak
;
it
is
Joab
's
embrace
,
and
Judah
's
kiss
;
in
a
word
,
it
is
*NL*
mankind
's
darling
sin
,
and
the
devil
's
distinguishing
character
.
Some
*NL*
add
lies
to
lies
,
till
it
not
only
comes
to
be
improbable
,
but
even
*NL*
impossible
too
:
Others
lie
for
gain
to
deceive
,
delude
,
and
betray
:
And
*NL*
a
third
lies
for
sport
,
or
for
fun
.
There
are
other
liars
,
who
are
*NL*
personal
and
malicious
;
who
foment
differences
,
and
carry
tales
from
one
*NL*
house
to
another
,
in
order
to
gratify
their
own
envious
tempers
,
without
*NL*
any
regard
to
reverence
or

On
February
1st
,
1709
,
we
came
before
that
island
,
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
having
had
a
good
*NL*
observation
the
day
before
,
and
found
our
latitude
to
be
34
degrees
10
*NL*
minutes
south
.
In
the
afternoon
,
we
hoisted
out
our
pinnace
;
and
Captain
*NL*
Dover
,
with
the
boat
's
crew
,
went
in
her
to
go
ashore
,
though
we
could
*NL*
not
be
less
that
four
leagues
off
.
As
soon
as
the
pinnace
was
gone
,
I
*NL*
went
on
board
the
Duchess
,
who
admired
our
boat
attempting
going
ashore
*NL*
at
that
distance
from
land
.
It
was
against
my
inclination
:
but
,
to
*NL*
oblige
Captain
Dover
,
I
let
her
go
:
As
soon
as
it
was
dark
,
we
saw
a
*NL*
light
ashore
.
Our
boat
was
then
about
a
league
off
the
island
,
and
bore
*NL*
away
for
the
ship
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
lights
:
We
put
our
lights
*NL*
aboard
for
the
boat
,
though
some
were
of
opinion
,
the
lights
we
saw
were
*NL*
our
boat
's
lights
:
But
,
as
night
came
on
,
it
appeared
too
large
for
*NL*
that
:
We
fired
our
quarter-deck
gun
,
and
several
muskets
,
showing
lights
*NL*
in
our
mizen
and
fore-shrouds
,
that
our
boat
might
find
us
whilst
we
*NL*
were
in
the
lee
of
the
island
:
About
two
in
the
morning
our
boat
came
on
*NL*
board
,
having
been
two
hours
on
board
the
Duchess
,
that
took
them
up
*NL*
astern
of
us
;
we
were
glad
they
got
well
off
,
because
it
began
to
blow
.
*NL*
We
were
all
convinces
the
light
was
on
the
shore
,
and
designed
to
make
*NL*
our
ships
ready
to
engage
,
believing
them
to
be
French
ships
at
anchor
,
*NL*
and
we
must
either
fight
them
,
or
want
water
.
All
this
stir
and
*NL*
apprehension
arose
,
as
we
afterwards
found
,
from
one
poor
naked
man
,
who
*NL*
passed
in
our
imagination
,
at
present
,
for
a
Spanish
garrison
,
a
body
of
*NL*
Frenchmen
,
or
a
crew
of
pirates
.
While
we
were
under
these
*NL*
apprehensions
,
we
stood
on
the
backside
of
the
island
,
in
order
to
fall
*NL*
in
with
the
southerly
wind
,
till
we
were
past
the
island
;
and
then
we
*NL*
came
back
to
it
again
,
and
ran
close
aboard
the
land
that
begins
to
make
*NL*
the
north-east
side
.

*NL*
*NL*
We
still
continued
to
reason
upon
this
matter
;
and
it
is
in
a
manner
*NL*
incredible
,
what
strange
notions
many
of
our
people
entertained
from
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
fire
upon
the
island
.
It
served
,
however
,
to
show
people
's
*NL*
tempers
and
spirits
;
and
we
were
able
to
give
a
tolerable
guess
how
our
*NL*
men
would
behave
,
in
case
there
really
were
any
enemies
upon
the
island
.
*NL*
The
flaws
came
heavy
off
the
shore
,
and
we
were
forced
to
reef
our
*NL*
topsails
when
we
opened
the
middle
bay
,
where
we
expected
to
have
found
*NL*
our
enemy
;
but
saw
all
clear
,
&
no
ships
,
nor
in
the
other
bay
next
the
*NL*
north-east
end
.
These
two
bays
are
all
that
ships
ride
in
,
which
recruit
*NL*
on
this
island
;
but
the
middle
bay
is
by
much
the
best
.
We
guessed
there
*NL*
had
been
ships
there
,
but
that
they
were
gone
on
sight
of
us
.
We
sent
*NL*
our
yawl
ashore
about
noon
,
with
Captain
Dover
,
Mr.
Fry
,
and
six
men
,
*NL*
all
armed
:
Mean
while
we
and
the
Duchess
kept
turning
to
get
in
,
and
*NL*
such
heavy
flaws
came
off
the
land
,
that
we
were
forced
to
let
go
our
*NL*
top
sail
sheet
,
keeping
all
hands
to
stand
by
our
sails
,
for
fear
of
the
*NL*
winds
carrying
them
away
:
But
when
the
flaws
were
gone
,
we
had
little
or
*NL*
no
wind
.
These
flaws
proceeded
from
the
land
;
which
is
very
high
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
island
.
Our
boat
did
not
return
;
we
sent
our
pinnace
with
*NL*
the
men
armed
,
to
see
what
was
the
occasion
of
the
yawl
's
stay
;
for
we
*NL*
were
afraid
,
that
the
Spaniards
had
a
garrison
there
,
and
might
have
*NL*
seized
them
.
We
put
out
a
signal
for
our
boat
,
and
the
Duchess
showed
a
*NL*
French
ensign
.
Immediately
our
pinnace
returned
from
the
shore
,
and
*NL*
brought
abundance
of
cry-fish
,
with
a
man
clothed
in
goats
skins
,
who
*NL*
looked
wilder
than
the
first
owners
of
them
.
He
had
been
on
the
island
*NL*
four
years
and
four
months
,
being
left
there
by
Captain
Stradling
in
the
*NL*
Cinque-ports
,
his
name
was
Alexander
Selkirk
,
a
Scotchman
,
who
had
been
*NL*
master
of
the
Cinque-ports
,
a
ship
that
came
here
last
with
Captain
*NL*
Dampier
,
who
told
me
,
that
this
was
the
best
man
in
her
.
I
immediately
*NL*
agreed
with
him
to
be
a
mate
on
board
our
ship
:
It
was
he
that
made
the
*NL*
fire
last
night
when
he
saw
our
ships
,
which
he
judged
to
be
English
.
*NL*
During
his
stay
here
he
saw
several
ships
pass
by
,
but
only
two
came
in
*NL*
to
anchors
:
As
he
went
to
view
them
;
he
found
them
to
be
Spaniards
,
and
*NL*
retired
from
them
,
upon
which
they
shot
at
him
:
Had
they
been
French
,
he
*NL*
would
have
submitted
;
but
choose
to
risque
his
dying
alone
on
the
*NL*
island
,
rather
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
Spaniards
in
these
parts
;
*NL*
because
he
apprehended
they
would
murder
him
,
or
make
a
slave
of
him
in
*NL*
the
mines
;
for
he
feared
they
would
spare
no
stranger
that
might
be
*NL*
capable
of
discovering
the
South
Seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spaniards
had
landed
,
before
he
knew
what
they
were
;
and
they
came
*NL*
so
near
him
,
that
he
had
much
ado
to
escape
;
for
they
not
only
shot
at
*NL*
him
,
but
pursued
him
to
the
woods
,
where
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
*NL*
tree
,
at
the
foot
of
which
they
made
water
,
and
killed
several
goats
*NL*
just
by
,
but
went
off
again
without
discovering
him
.
He
told
us
that
he
*NL*
was
born
at
Largo
,
in
the
county
of
Fife
,
in
Scotland
,
and
was
bred
a
*NL*
sailor
from
his
youth
.
The
reason
of
his
being
left
here
was
difference
*NL*
between
him
and
his
captain
;
which
together
with
the
ship
's
being
leaky
,
*NL*
made
him
willing
rather
to
stay
here
,
than
go
along
with
him
at
first
;
*NL*
but
when
he
was
at
last
willing
to
go
,
the
captain
would
not
receive
*NL*
him
.
He
had
been
at
the
island
before
,
to
wood
and
water
,
when
two
of
*NL*
the
ship
's
company
were
left
upon
it
for
six
mouths
,
till
the
Ship
*NL*
returned
,
being
chased
thence
by
two
French
South-sea
ships
.
He
had
with
*NL*
him
his
cloaths
and
bedding
,
with
a
firelock
,
some
powder
,
bullets
and
*NL*
tobacco
,
a
hatchet
,
a
knife
,
a
kettle
,
a
bible
,
some
practical
pieces
,
*NL*
and
his
mathematical
instruments
and
books
.
He
diverted
and
provided
for
*NL*
himself
as
well
as
he
could
;
but
for
the
first
eight
months
,
had
much
*NL*
ado
to
bear
up
against
melancholy
,
and
the
terror
of
being
left
alone
in
*NL*
such
a
desolate
place
.
He
built
two
huts
with
pimento
trees
,
covered
*NL*
them
with
long
grass
,
&
lined
them
with
the
skins
of
goats
,
which
be
*NL*
killed
with
his
gun
as
he
wanted
,
so
long
as
his
powder
lasted
,
which
*NL*
was
but
a
pound
;
and
that
being
almost
spent
,
he
got
fire
by
rubbing
two
*NL*
sticks
of
pimento-wood
together
upon
his
knee
.
In
the
lesser
hut
,
at
*NL*
some
distance
from
the
other
,
he
dressed
his
victuals
;
and
in
the
larger
*NL*
he
slept
;
and
employed
himself
in
reading
,
singing
psalms
,
and
praying
;
*NL*
so
that
he
said
.
He
was
a
better
Christian
,
while
in
this
solitude
,
than
*NL*
ever
he
was
before
,
or
than
,
he
was
afraid
,
he
would
ever
be
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
never
ate
anything
till
hunger
constrained
him
,
partly
for
*NL*
grief
,
and
partly
for
want
of
bread
and
salt
:
Nor
did
he
go
to
bed
,
till
*NL*
he
could
watch
no
longer
;
the
pimento-wood
,
which
burnt
very
clear
,
*NL*
served
him
both
for
fire
and
candle
,
and
refreshed
him
with
its
fragrant
*NL*
smell
.
He
might
have
had
fish
enough
,
but
would
not
eat
them
for
want
of
*NL*
salt
,
because
they
occasioned
a
looseness
,
except
crayfish
which
are
as
*NL*
large
as
our
lobsters
,
and
very
good
:
These
he
sometimes
boiled
,
and
at
*NL*
other
times
broiled
,
as
he
did
his
goat
's
flesh
,
of
,
which
he
made
very
*NL*
good
broth
,
for
they
are
not
so
rank
as
ours
:
he
kept
an
account
of
500
*NL*
that
he
killed
while
there
,
and
caught
as
many
more
,
which
he
marked
on
*NL*
the
ear
,
and
let
go
.
When
,
his
powder
failed
,
he
took
them
by
speed
of
*NL*
feet
;
for
his
way
of
living
,
continual
exercise
of
walking
and
running
*NL*
cleared
him
of
all
gross
humours
;
so
that
he
ran
with
wonderful
*NL*
swiftness
through
the
woods
,
and
up
the
rocks
and
hills
,
as
we
perceived
*NL*
when
we
employed
him
to
catch
goats
for
us
;
We
had
a
bull
dog
,
which
we
*NL*
lent
with
several
of
our
nimblest
runners
,
to
help
him
in
catching
*NL*
goats
;
but
he
distanced
and
tired
both
the
dog
and
the
men
,
caught
the
*NL*
goats
,
and
brought
them
to
us
on
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
us
,
that
his
agility
in
pursuing
a
goat
had
once
like
to
have
*NL*
cost
him
his
life
;
he
pursued
it
with
so
much
eagerness
,
that
he
catched
*NL*
hold
of
it
on
the
brink
of
a
precipiece
,
of
which
he
was
not
aware
,
the
*NL*
bushes
hiding
it
from
him
;
so
,
that
he
fell
with
the
goat
down
the
*NL*
precipiece
;
a
great
height
,
and
was
to
stunned
and
bruised
with
the
*NL*
fall
,
that
he
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
;
and
,
when
he
came
to
his
*NL*
senses
,
found
the
goat
dead
under
him
:
He
lay
there
about
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
,
and
was
scarce
able
to
crawl
to
his
hut
,
which
was
about
a
mile
*NL*
distant
,
or
to
stir
abroad
again
in
ten
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
at
last
to
relish
his
meat
well
enough
without
salt
or
bread
;
*NL*
and
,
in
the
season
had
plenty
of
good
turreps
,
which
had
been
sewed
*NL*
there
by
Captain
Dampier
's
men
,
and
have
now
overspread
some
acres
of
*NL*
ground
.
He
had
enough
of
good
cabbage
from
the
cabbage-trees
,
and
*NL*
seasoned
his
meat
with
the
fruit
of
the
pimento
trees
,
which
is
the
same
*NL*
as
Jamaica
pepper
,
and
smells
deliciously
:
He
found
also
a
black
pepper
,
*NL*
called
Ma'azeta
,
which
was
very
good
to
expel
wind
,
and
against
gripping
*NL*
in
the
guts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
wore
out
all
his
shoes
and
clothes
by
running
in
the
woods
;
and
*NL*
at
last
,
being
forced
to
shift
without
them
,
his
feet
became
so
hard
,
*NL*
that
he
ran
everywhere
without
difficulty
;
and
it
was
some
time
before
*NL*
he
could
wear
shoes
after
we
found
him
;
for
not
being
used
to
any
so
*NL*
long
,
his
feet
swelled
when
he
came
first
to
wear
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
conquered
his
melancholy
,
he
diverted
himself
sometimes
*NL*
with
cutting
his
name
in
the
trees
,
and
the
time
of
his
being
left
,
and
*NL*
continuance
there
.
He
was
at
first
much
pestered
with
cats
and
rats
,
*NL*
that
bred
in
great
numbers
,
from
some
of
each
species
which
had
got
*NL*
ashore
from
ships
that
put
in
there
to
wood
and
water
:
The
rats
gnawed
*NL*
his
feet
and
cloathes
whilst
asleep
,
which
obliged
him
to
cherish
the
*NL*
cats
with
his
goats
flesh
,
by
which
many
of
them
became
so
tame
,
that
*NL*
they
would
lie
about
him
in
hundreds
,
and
soon
delivered
him
from
the
*NL*
rats
:
He
likewise
tamed
some
kids
;
and
,
to
divert
himself
would
,
now
and
*NL*
then
,
sing
and
dance
with
them
,
and
his
cats
:
So
that
by
the
favour
of
*NL*
Providence
,
and
vigour
of
his
youth
,
being
now
but
thirty
years
old
,
he
*NL*
came
,
at
last
,
to
conquer
all
the
inconveniencies
of
his
solitude
,
and
*NL*
to
be
very
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
cloathes
were
worn
out
,
he
made
himself
a
coat
and
a
cap
of
*NL*
goat-skins
,
which
he
stiched
together
with
little
thongs
of
the
same
,
*NL*
that
he
cut
with
his
knife
,
He
had
no
other
needle
but
a
nail
;
and
,
when
*NL*
his
knife
was
worn
to
the
back
,
he
made
others
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
of
*NL*
some
iron
hoops
that
were
left
ashore
,
which
he
beat
thin
,
and
ground
*NL*
upon
stones
.
Having
some
linnen
cloth
by
him
,
he
sewed
him
some
shirts
*NL*
with
a
nail
,
and
stiched
them
with
the
worsted
of
his
old
stockings
,
*NL*
which
he
pulled
out
on
purpose
.
He
had
his
last
shirt
on
,
when
we
found
*NL*
him
in
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
first
coming
on
board
us
,
he
had
so
much
forgot
his
language
,
for
*NL*
want
of
use
,
that
we
could
scarce
understand
him
:
for
he
seemed
to
speak
*NL*
his
words
by
halve
.
We
offered
him
a
dram
:
but
he
would
not
touch
it
;
*NL*
having
drank
nothing
but
water
since
his
being
there
;
And
it
was
*NL*
sometime
before
he
could
relish
our
victuals
.
He
could
give
us
an
*NL*
account
of
no
other
product
of
the
island
,
than
what
we
have
mentioned
,
*NL*
except
some
black
plums
,
which
are
very
good
,
but
hard
to
come
at
,
the
*NL*
trees
,
which
bear
them
,
growing
on
high
mountains
and
rocks
.
*NL*
Pimento-trees
are
plenty
here
,
and
we
saw
some
of
sixty
feet
high
and
*NL*
about
two
yards
thick
;
and
cotton-trees
higher
,
and
near
four
fathoms
*NL*
round
in
the
stock
.
The
climate
is
so
good
that
the
trees
and
grass
are
*NL*
verdant
all
the
year
round
.
The
winter
lasts
no
longer
than
June
and
*NL*
July
,
and
is
not
then
severe
,
there
being
only
a
small
frost
,
and
a
*NL*
little
hail
:
but
sometimes
great
rains
.
The
heat
of
the
summer
is
*NL*
equally
moderate
;
and
there
is
not
much
thunder
,
or
tempestuous
weather
*NL*
of
any
sort
.
He
saw
no
venomous
or
savage
creature
on
the
island
,
nor
*NL*
any
sort
of
beasts
but
goats
,
the
first
of
which
had
been
put
ashore
*NL*
here
,
on
purpose
for
a
breed
,
by
Juan
Fernandez
,
a
Spaniard
,
who
settled
*NL*
there
with
some
families
,
till
the
continent
of
Chili
began
to
submit
to
*NL*
the
Spaniards
;
which
,
being
more
profitable
;
tempted
them
to
quit
this
*NL*
island
,
capable
however
,
of
maintaining
a
good
number
of
people
,
and
*NL*
being
made
so
strong
,
that
they
could
hot
be
easily
dislodged
from
*NL*
thence
.
*NL*
*NL*
February
3d
we
got
our
smith
's
forge
on
shore
,
set
our
coopers
to
work
,
*NL*
and
made
a
little
tent
for
me
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
air
.
The
*NL*
Duchess
had
also
a
tent
for
their
sick
men
;
so
that
we
had
a
small
town
*NL*
of
our
own
here
,
and
every
body
employed
.
A
few
men
supplied
us
all
with
*NL*
fish
of
several
sorts
,
all
very
good
,
in
such
abundance
,
that
,
in
a
few
*NL*
hours
,
we
could
take
as
many
as
would
serve
200
.
There
were
sea-fowls
in
*NL*
the
bay
,
as
large
as
geese
:
but
eat
fishy
.
The
governor
never
failed
of
*NL*
procuring
us
two
or
three
goats
a
day
for
our
sick
men
;
by
which
,
with
*NL*
the
help
of
the
greens
,
and
the
wholesome
air
,
they
recovered
very
soon
*NL*
of
the
scurvy
;
so
that
Captain
Dover
and
I
thought
it
a
very
agreeable
*NL*
seat
,
the
weather
being
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
.
We
spent
our
time
,
*NL*
till
the
10th
,
in
refitting
our
ships
,
taking
wood
on
board
;
and
laying
*NL*
in
water
,
that
which
we
brought
from
England
and
St.
Vincent
being
*NL*
spoiled
by
the
badness
of
the
casks
.
We
likewise
boiled
up
about
eighty
*NL*
gallons
of
sea-lions
oil
,
as
we
might
have
done
several
tons
,
had
we
*NL*
been
provided
with
vessels
.
We
refined
it
for
our
lamps
,
to
save
*NL*
candles
.
The
sailors
sometimes
use
it
to
fry
their
meat
,
for
want
of
*NL*
butter
,
and
find
it
agreeable
enough
.
The
men
who
worked
on
our
*NL*
rigging
,
eat
young
seals
,
which
they
preferred
to
our
ships
victuals
,
&
*NL*
said
it
was
as
good
as
English
lamb
,
though
I
should
have
been
glad
of
*NL*
such
an
exchange
.
We
made
what
haste
we
could
to
get
all
the
necessaries
*NL*
on
board
,
being
willing
to
lose
no
time
;
for
we
were
informed
at
the
*NL*
Canaries
,
that
five
stout
French
ships
were
coming
together
to
those
*NL*
seas
.
